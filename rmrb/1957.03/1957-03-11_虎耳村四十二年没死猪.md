    Tiger Ear Village Hasn't Had a Dead Pig in Forty-Two Years
    (Our report) According to the Fujian Daily, a village in Pinghe County, Fujian, has recently been discovered that has not had a pig die from disease in forty-two years – Tiger Ear Village. This village has eighteen households, and every household raises pigs. Because the pigs have not suffered from any disease-related deaths, pig farmers have a large income. In recent years, they have used the money from raising pigs to build and repair nine new houses.
    The reason why Tiger Ear Village has not had any outbreaks of swine fever or deaths of pigs in forty-two years is mainly because the epidemic prevention work is done well. The village has established a livestock protection agreement, which everyone has conscientiously observed for decades. The entire village has achieved: every household builds pig pens, pigs do not leave the village and are isolated from pigs from other villages, which not only accumulates fertilizer but also avoids the occurrence of infectious diseases; they do not buy sick pigs to raise, and do not buy piglets from places where pig epidemics are prevalent; they do not eat sick or dead pig meat. When pig diseases occur nearby, the village buys pork to eat from Gao Keng Village, which is more than twenty miles away. The meat they buy is washed with hot water, and the water used to wash the meat is poured outside the village. In addition, pig farmers pay close attention to the cleanliness of pigsties, feed pigs carefully, and do not leave leftover feed in the troughs. After feeding, they also wash the troughs with clean water and do not allow dogs to lick the pig troughs. In this way, they have cut off all opportunities for the spread of disease. When the village finds that a pig is eating less or is not in good spirits, they immediately isolate the sick pig and treat it.

    虎耳村四十二年没死猪
    本报讯　据福建日报报道：福建平和县最近发现了一个四十二年来没有病死过猪的村子——虎耳村。这个村住有十八户人家，户户都养猪。由于猪子没有发生过病死的现象，养猪户收入很大，几年来，已用养猪的钱新盖和修建了九间房子。
    虎耳村四十二年来所以没有发生过猪瘟以及病死猪的现象，主要是防疫工作做得好。这个村订了个护畜公约，几十年来大家都认真遵守，全村做到：户户修圈养猪，猪不出村，和外村的猪隔离开来，既积了肥，又避免发生传染病；不买病猪养，不到猪疫流行的地方买小猪；不吃病猪和死猪肉，附近发生猪病时，村里就到二十多里路外的高坑村买猪肉吃，买来的肉都用热水洗过，洗肉的水也倒到村外去。此外，养猪户还十分注意猪舍的清洁工作，喂猪很细心，不留槽底。喂完以后，还用清水洗槽，不让狗?猪槽。这样，就断绝了一切疾病传染的机会。当村里发现猪少吃或精神不好的时候，立刻将病猪隔离，并进行治疗。
