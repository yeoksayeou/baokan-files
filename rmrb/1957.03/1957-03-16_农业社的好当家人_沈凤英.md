Shen Fengying, the director of the Wanshi Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xindeng County, Zhejiang Province, is praised by all the cooperative members as a good head of household.

Wanshi Township is located in a barren mountainous area. Before liberation, each mu of land could only yield about two hundred catties of grain. It was a place described as "poor mountains, bitter valleys, and worries in all four seasons." In 1952, after running mutual aid teams for more than two years, Shen Fengying established a preliminary cooperative with ten farming households. In October 1954, it expanded to more than one hundred households, becoming an advanced cooperative. After the upsurge of cooperativization reached Wanshi Township in 1955, this cooperative merged with some surrounding preliminary cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers to form an advanced cooperative with more than six hundred households. The members unanimously elected Shen Fengying, a Communist Party member who had been the first in the area (in 1950) to respond to the Party's call and lead farmers on the path of cooperativization, as the director of the cooperative.

Shen Fengying accepted the trust of the members and took on the heavy burden of the fate of more than a thousand people. She did not disappoint the members, and the cooperative has had bumper harvests year after year. Although last year was threatened by floods unseen in decades, the total income still increased compared to the previous year, and 91.5% of the members increased their income, thanks to the full exploitation of the advantages of the cooperative and the development of diversified operations, thus overcoming the flood disaster. The members deeply realized the benefits of the cooperative and further strengthened their confidence in advancing on the road of cooperativization.

"Thanks to the determination of our leader"

The path taken by Shen Fengying and the agricultural cooperative she leads has not been smooth. When the agricultural cooperative was established in 1954, it was sabotaged by counter-revolutionaries Wu Fanghua and rich peasant Jin Huilai. They said to some members, "There is no benefit in joining the cooperative. It is better to work individually; you are free to sleep and free to produce..." At that time, six members were influenced by them and proposed withdrawing from the cooperative. Shen Fengying promptly exposed the enemy's conspiracy, educated the members, raised their awareness, and stabilized their emotions. The enemy said with resentment, "The evil spirit lingers, the corpse will not rot!" (meaning: one day they would retaliate against her). But Shen Fengying was not afraid. The story of the heroine Liu Hulan, which she heard in Party classes, supported her. Later, the People's Government finally arrested these two counter-revolutionaries who were sabotaging the cooperative movement according to law.

In the spring of 1955, Shen Fengying and the cooperative she led encountered another test: the erroneous policy of "resolute contraction" was passed down. Some leading cadres were afraid that it would be difficult to lead a large cooperative, so they insisted on dismantling and downgrading their cooperative. Some wealthy farmers in the cooperative also began to complain and demand withdrawal. Some of the surrounding preliminary cooperatives shrank, some turned back into mutual aid teams, and some dissolved. At that time, Shen Fengying thought: Since the establishment of the cooperative, wasteland had been reclaimed, dams had been built, and some dry land had been converted into paddy fields. Production would definitely increase in the long run. The Party taught us to take the road of cooperativization; "contraction" could not be Chairman Mao's idea. Therefore, she wanted to persuade the members to resolutely continue. At that time, some members suggested, "If the cooperative director wants to run the cooperative, she will have to compensate if the income is reduced." In the end, Shen Fengying received the support of the Party, and with the help of the district committee, educated those members who wanted to withdraw and consolidated the cooperative. The harvest that year was better than any previous year, with grain production increasing by more than 50%, and the members received an average of more than 4,630 catties per household. The cooperative was filled with joy. No one doubted that the advanced cooperative could not be run well. Many members said, "Thanks to the determination of our leader. If we had broken up, we would not have had such a good harvest!"

Relying on Collective Wisdom

Shen Fengying's ability lies in her understanding of mobilizing the masses and relying on the collective. People say: The characteristic of the Wanshi Township Agricultural Cooperative Management Committee is that there are many "Zhuge Liang meetings." When there is a problem, they discuss it, concentrate everyone's wisdom, and research solutions. At the beginning of the abolition of land remuneration in the cooperative, some members adopted the attitude of "producing for the cooperative," and the phenomenon of "leaving at nine o'clock and returning when the sun is red" appeared, which seriously hindered the completion of the spring plowing task. Seeing this situation, she convened the Management Committee to study how to educate the masses to change this attitude. Everyone believed that the members must be encouraged to establish a sense of being masters of their own affairs and to inspire the members to educate themselves. Therefore, a members' meeting was held to present these situations and discuss with the members what to do. The members conducted self-criticism and mutual checks, formulated labor discipline, and overcame the slackness.

Last spring, the cooperative decided to accumulate more soil fertilizer to reduce production costs. The cooperative cadres calculated detailed accounts with the members, explaining the principle that increasing income must further reduce costs. Because the masses were fully mobilized, a mass "digging hairy pit feet" fertilizer accumulation campaign was launched, and 120,000 catties were dug in more than ten days, reducing last year's production costs by 17%.

In terms of developing diversified operations, the cooperative originally planned to plant 130,000 mulberry trees; some cooperative cadres believed that there was no place to plant so many. After mobilizing the masses to put forward rationalization proposals, 240,000 trees were planted instead.

Go to the Most Difficult Places

With a large cooperative, the team cadres are strong and weak, and it is impossible to do a good job by relying solely on "mass mobilization." Shen Fengying often goes deep into the teams to help them solve specific problems. Last spring, the cooperative promoted the advanced technology of "semi-dry seedling fields." All the teams in the cooperative implemented it, except for one small team. So, she went to this small team and talked to the small team leader. She learned that the reason was that the small team leader was afraid of "trouble" and was unwilling to promote it. She patiently explained the advantages of "semi-dry seedling fields" compared to water seedling fields and educated the small team leader. As a result, the ten mu of seedling fields all implemented "semi-dry seedling fields."

In times of difficulty, Shen Fengying often uses her own exemplary actions to drive the members forward. In the spring of 1954, the cooperative suffered several flood threats. Twice, the rice seedlings were washed down again as soon as they were erected. When the third flood came, some members were discouraged. Some said, "Even if the cooperative is superior, it cannot cope with natural disasters." Shen Fengying still strongly mobilized everyone to fight against the floods. She braved the rain and darkness to cut wood piles and bamboo poles overnight, and used doors, bamboo baskets, etc. to block the water. Some negative members were moved by her actions. Everyone finally worked together to overcome the flood. Last year, under the threat of floods, she took the lead in working hard and, together with several members, rescued ninety-seven pigs from the cooperative in the floodwaters.

Caring for the Members, Caring for the Members

The cooperative is a big family for all the members. Shen Fengying deeply realized that being a cooperative director means not only leading the cooperative's production but also caring about the lives of the members. Only by caring about the members' hardships and helping them solve difficult problems can their collectivist ideology be improved and their production enthusiasm be fully utilized. In 1954, for a period of time, member Dai Bentang fell ill. He only had a twelve- or thirteen-year-old son at home, and it was difficult to take care of everything. Shen Fengying invited a doctor for him, helped him with housework, and mobilized the neighbors to take good care of him. After Dai Bentang recovered, he said with emotion, "The cooperative is really my own home." Last year, member Mao Haigen's house was completely flooded, with no place to live and nothing to use. Shen Fengying took his entire family to her own home and discussed with township cadres to decide to subsidize him with forty yuan from the public welfare fund. Now he has rebuilt his house and is living a comfortable life. Mao Haigen said, "If it weren't for the Communist Party, I would have no way to even beg for food."

Not Doing "Half a Cooperative Director"

When Shen Fengying was attending a meeting in the county, she heard the county party committee responsible comrades say to the cooperative directors: "Women account for half of the population. If you don't pay attention to women's work, you can only be considered half a cooperative director." She thought that she was a woman and should pay more attention to women's work. She has always adhered to the principle of mobilizing both men and women, paying attention to political and ideological education for women, and valuing women's backbone. This cooperative has indeed implemented the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women, which has encouraged the labor enthusiasm of female members. The political awareness of female members has been continuously improved. Now, there are six female party members and thirty-eight female members of the Communist Youth League in the cooperative. Under their leadership, most of the women in the cooperative have participated in field labor, and many female members have learned to use double-wheeled double-share plows.

    农业社的好当家人—沈凤英
    浙江省新登县万市乡农业生产合作社的社员们，谁都称赞社主任沈凤英是个好当家人。
    万市乡处于贫瘠的山区，解放前每亩田只能收二百来斤粮食，是一个“穷山头，苦山沟，一年倒有四季愁”的地方。1952年，沈凤英在办了两年多互助组以后办了一个有十户农民参加的初级社。1954年10月扩大到一百多户，办成了高级社。1955年合作化高潮到了万市乡以后，这个社和周围的一些初级社、互助组、单干户合并组织成六百多户的高级社。社员们一致选举了在当地最早（1950年）响应党的号召，领导农民走合作化道路的共产党员沈凤英为社主任。
    沈凤英接受了社员们的信托，担起了关系着一千多人的命运的大担子。她没有辜负社员们的心意，合作社连年丰收了。去年虽然遭到几十年来未有的洪水威胁，但由于充分地发挥了合作社的优越性，开展了多种经营，战胜了洪水灾害，总收入仍比前年有所增加，91.5％的社员增加了收入。社员们深深地体会到合作社的好处，更坚定了在合作化道路上前进的信心。
    “多亏我们的当家人坚决”
    沈凤英和她领导的农业社所走过的道路并不是平坦无阻的。1954年农业社成立的时候，就曾遭到反革命分子吴芳华和富农金惠来的破坏。他们对一些社员说：“参加合作社没有好处，还是单干好，睡觉自由，生产自由……”当时有六户社员受了他们的影响，提出退社。沈凤英及时揭发了敌人的阴谋，对社员进行了教育，使社员提高了觉悟，稳定了情绪。敌人曾怀恨地说：“阴魂不散，死尸不烂！”（意思是：总有一天要对她报复。）但沈凤英毫不畏惧。在上党课时听到的女英雄刘胡兰的事迹在支持着她。后来，人民政府终于依法把这两个破坏合作化运动的反革命分子逮捕了。
    1955年春天，沈凤英和她领导的合作社又遇到了一次考验：“坚决收缩”的错误方针传下来了，有些领导干部怕社大难领导，硬要他们的社拆散、降级。社里有些富裕农民也开始讲怪话、闹退社。周围的初级社有的缩小了，有的又变成互助组了，有的解散了。当时沈凤英想：合作社成立以来开了荒山，修了大坝，部分旱地也改成了水田，算来算去定能增产。党教育我们走合作化的道路，“收缩”不会是毛主席的主张。因此，她想说服社员要坚决办下去。那时有些社员就提出：“社长要办社，如果减少了收入要她赔偿。”最后，沈凤英得到了党的支持，在区委的帮助下，教育了那些想退社的社员，把社巩固下来了。当年的收成比那年都好，粮食增产五成多，社员每户平均分到四千六百三十多斤，社里到处洋溢着喜气。谁也不再怀疑高级社办不好了。许多社员都说：“多亏我们的当家人坚决，要是散了伙，那会有这样好的收成！”
    依靠集体的智慧
    沈凤英的本领就在于她懂得发动群众，依靠集体。人们说：万市乡农业社管理委员会的特点是“诸葛亮会”多，一有问题就讨论，集中大家的智慧，研究出解决的办法。合作社取消了土地报酬之初，有些社员就抱着“替社生产”的态度，出现了“出门九点钟，回来太阳红”的现象，严重地妨碍春耕任务的完成。她看到这种情况，就召开了管理委员会，研究如何教育群众改变这种态度。大家认为：必须让社员树立当家作主的思想，启发社员群众自己教育自己。于是召开了社员大会，把这些情况都摆出来，和社员们商量该怎么办。社员们进行了自我批评和互相检查，订出了劳动纪律，克服了松懈的现象。
    去年春天，社里决定多积土肥，降低生产成本。社干部分头和社员算了细账，说明要增加收入必须进一步降低成本的道理。由于充分地发动了群众，掀起了群众性的“挖毛坑脚”积肥运动，十多天就挖了十二万斤，使去年的生产成本降低了17％。
    在开展多种经营方面，社里原规划种植桑树十三万株；有些社干部认为没有地方能够种那么多。在发动群众提合理化建议以后，却种了二十四万株。
    到最困难的地方去
    社大，队的干部有强有弱，光靠“大呼隆”号召是不能把工作做好的。沈凤英经常深入下去，帮助各队解决具体问题。去年春天，社里推行“半旱秧田”的先进技术，全社各队都实行了，只有一个小队没有动。于是，她就到这个小队找小队长谈话。她了解到原因是小队长怕“麻烦”，不愿意推行。她耐心地把“半旱秧田”比水秧田有哪些好处算了细账，教育了小队长。结果，十亩秧田全部推行了“半旱秧田”。
    在困难的时候，沈凤英往往是以自己的模范行动带动社员前进。1954年春天，社里遭受了几次洪水威胁。两次都是刚扶起稻苗就又被洪水冲倒。在第三次洪水到来的时候，社员们有些灰心了。有的说： “合作社再优越也对付不了天灾。”沈凤英仍然坚强地动员大家同洪水斗争，自己冒雨摸黑，连夜砍木桩、毛竹，用门板、篾笼等堵水。有些消极的社员被她的行动感动了。大家终于同心合力把洪水战胜了。去年在洪水威胁中，她又领头苦干，同几个社员一起在大水中抢救了社里的九十七只猪。
    关心社员，体贴社员
    合作社是全体社员的大家庭。沈凤英深切体会到：当一个社主任，不但要领导社里的生产，还要关心社员的生活。只有关心社员的疾苦，帮助他们解决困难问题，才能提高他们的集体主义思想，充分发挥他们的生产积极性。1954年，有一个时期，社员戴本堂生病了。他家里只有一个十二、三岁的儿子，顾里顾外都困难。沈凤英给他请医生，帮助他料理家务，又动员邻居好好照顾他。戴本堂病好后感动地说：“合作社真是自己的家。”去年社员毛海根家被洪水淹的净光，没住的，没用的。沈凤英就把他全家接到自己的家里住，并同乡干部研究，决定用公益金补助他四十元。现在他已经重新修建了房子，过着安乐的日子。毛海根说：“要不是共产党，我连讨饭也没路。”
    不做“半个社主任”
    沈凤英在县里开会，听到县委负责同志对社主任们说：“妇女占人口的一半，不重视妇女工作，只能算是半个社主任。”她想，自己是个妇女，更应该重视妇女工作。她一贯坚持男女一齐发动的方针，注意对妇女进行政治思想教育，重视妇女骨干。这个社确实贯彻执行了男女同工同酬的原则，鼓舞了女社员的劳动积极性。女社员的政治觉悟不断提高，现在，全社已有六个女党员、三十八个女团员。在她们的带动下，全社绝大部分妇女都参加了田间劳动，有不少女社员学会了使用双轮双铧犁。
