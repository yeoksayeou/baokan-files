Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, March 27th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Qi Huizhi reports: Following the successive opening of sections of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway to traffic, a new land and water transportation network with the railway as its trunk line has been formed within Fujian Province, fundamentally changing the historically backward transportation situation in Fujian Province.

　　Simultaneous with the construction of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, Fujian Province's land and water transportation departments constructed over 1,000 kilometers of highways and simple roads on both sides of the railway and dredged and opened over 600 kilometers of inland waterways. Together with those constructed in the past few years, Fujian Province currently has over 5,000 kilometers of highways passable by automobiles and over 4,000 kilometers of waterways passable by steamships and wooden sailing boats. Of the province's sixty-seven counties and cities, sixty-two are accessible by automobile, and the remaining five counties can also be reached by sailing boat.

　　The northwestern Fujian region, which originally had the most closed-off transportation, now has more than ten newly built highways and simple roads on both sides of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway trunk line, such as Shaowu to Taining, Zhangping to Longyan, and Masha to Hengkeng, which are connected to the original highways, linking the counties of northern and western Fujian to the railway. A total of more than 300 automobiles travel on these roads every day.

　　The Minjiang, Jiulongjiang, Jinjiang, and Tingjiang rivers within Fujian Province, in addition to opening up more than 300 kilometers of new waterways last year, have also undergone large-scale dredging and improvement, greatly improving shipping conditions. On the 200-kilometer main stream of the Minjiang River from Nanping to Fuzhou, eighty-two dangerous shoals of all sizes have been blasted away, eight shallow shoals have been dug out, and thirty-five various guiding dams and five large and small docks have been built in the past year, making it a safe waterway that can be smoothly navigated all year round. The Jianxi River, a 60-kilometer long upstream section of the Minjiang River, has been dredged and can now accommodate shallow-water boats with a load capacity of about 20 tons.

　　福建境内形成新的水陆交通网
    新华社福州27日电　新华社记者戚慧之报道：鹰潭—厦门铁路逐段通车后，福建省境内以铁路为干线的新的水陆交通网已经形成，历史上福建省交通落后的情况开始根本改变。
    与鹰厦铁路修建的同时，福建省水陆交通部门在铁路两侧修建了一千多公里的公路和简易公路；整治和开辟了六百多公里内河航道。连同过去几年所修建的，目前福建全省已有可通汽车的公路五千多公里，通汽轮和木帆船的河道四千多公里。全省六十七个县市有六十二个县市可通汽车，另外五个县也有帆船可以通达。
    闽西北地区原来交通最闭塞，现在在鹰厦铁路干线两侧新建了邵武到泰宁、漳平到龙岩、麻沙到横坑等十多条公路和简易公路，与原有的公路相接，把闽北和闽西各县与铁路联成一片，每天总计有三百多辆汽车在这些公路上行驶。
    福建省境内的闽江、九龙江、晋江、汀江等河流，去年除了新开辟三百多公里航道以外，还经过了大规模的整治、疏浚，航运情况大为改善。从南平到福州的二百公里闽江干流，一年来炸除了大小险滩八十二处，挖掉浅滩八处，建筑了各种导流坝三十五座和大小码头五座，现在已经成为全年可以畅通的安全航线。闽江上游全长六十公里的建溪，经过疏浚后，现在可以通航载重二十吨左右的浅水轮。
