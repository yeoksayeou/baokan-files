Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 3rd: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia held a plenary session on February 27th and 28th, and passed a resolution on Comrade Ďuranský's report on "Striving to Improve the Effectiveness of the Czechoslovak National Economy."

The resolution stated that the Czechoslovak economy continued to develop in 1956. Industrial production reached 2.7 times the 1937 production level. Further achievements have also been made in increasing agricultural production. The stagnation in the level of capital construction has been overcome. New major production facilities have been put into production. The growth of industrial and agricultural production has made it possible for us to implement measures aimed at raising people's living standards. The living standards in 1956 reached the highest level Czechoslovakia had ever achieved.

The resolution went on to say, however, that some negative phenomena have also appeared in economic development. First of all, the planned increases in production and savings were not completed; some deliveries for capital construction and technological development, for supplying the domestic market, and for foreign trade (mainly in heavy industry) were not completed; and the planned ratio between the growth rate of labor productivity and the growth rate of wages was not observed. The internal difficulties of the Czechoslovak economy have increased due to certain external factors. Due to these unfavorable phenomena in economic development, a certain tension has arisen between sources and needs. The Czechoslovak national economy faces the serious task of ensuring the overcoming of current difficulties and creating the preconditions for further improvement of production and living standards.

The resolution stated that the most important task is to maximize the effectiveness of the entire national economy, to create social products and national income most effectively, and to distribute them most effectively. This requires the most efficient use of raw materials, the continuous improvement of social labor productivity, and the guarantee of comprehensively meeting the needs of the national economy; ensuring the further growth of agricultural production on the basis of strengthening large-scale socialist production, greatly improving the effectiveness of capital construction, and developing the economies of all regions according to their natural and economic conditions, especially the economies of Slovakia and the border regions. Actively develop economic cooperation with socialist camp countries, especially with the Soviet Union.

The resolution stated that the Central Committee believes it is necessary to take further measures to consistently implement the principle of democratic centralism in the organization, guidance, and planning of the national economy. In this regard, it believes that the management authority of enterprises should be further expanded so that they can independently complete their tasks. It is particularly important that they should be responsible for supplying the national economy or the sectors to which they belong with their various products and for selling their products.

The resolution pointed out that when agreeing to the transfer of management authority and responsibilities, it is also necessary to implement appropriate adjustment measures regarding design methods and systems. Its focus will shift from specifying the tasks of enterprises in detail using production-technical indicators to basic indicators. By emphasizing economic indicators, the completion of the task of guaranteeing the quality of the main aspects of the national economy and the observance of the main proportions of the national economy will be ensured. At the same time, the widest possible possibilities will be left for enterprises to exert their initiative.

The resolution emphasized that the Central Committee emphasized that in implementing these measures, it is necessary to resolutely combat the trends aimed at weakening the principles of planned central leadership, especially the trends of petty-bourgeois spontaneity, the distortion of the principle of democratic centralism, and the underestimation of the decisive importance of the economic and organizational activities of the people's democratic state in building a socialist economy.

The Central Committee believes that expanding the participation of the working people in management is particularly important, and the best way is through trade union organizations.

The Central Committee also emphasized the need to immediately implement effective measures in all links of the national economy to eliminate serious shortcomings in achieving the 1957 plan tasks.

    克服目前困难  保证生产和生活进一步提高
    捷共中央全会通过提高经济效力的决议
    新华社布拉格3日电  捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会2月27日和28日举行的全体会议，就杜兰斯基同志关于“争取提高捷克斯洛伐克国民经济的效力”的报告通过了一项决议。
    决议说，1956年捷克斯洛伐克的经济继续获得了发展。工业生产达到了1937年生产水平的二点七倍。在增加农业生产方面也取得了进一步的成就。基本建设水平的停滞已经克服。新的重大的生产设备已经投入了生产。工农业生产的增长使得我们有可能实行旨在提高人民生活标准的措施。1956年的生活水平达到了捷克斯洛伐克曾经达到过的最高水平。
    决议接着说，但是，经济发展中也有一些消极的现象出现。首先，计划规定的增产节约没有完成，供应基本建设和技术发展、供应国内市场和对外贸易的一些交货（主要是在重工业方面）没有完成，劳动生产率增长速度同工资增长速度之间计划的比例没有被遵守。捷克斯洛伐克经济的内部困难由于某些外界因素而有了增加。由于经济发展中这些不利现象，来源和需要之间发生了一定的紧张现象。捷克斯洛伐克国民经济面临着保证克服目前困难和为进一步提高生产和生活水平创造先决条件的严重任务。
    决议说，最重要的任务是最大限度地发挥整个国民经济的效力，最有效地创造社会产品和国民收入并且最有效地加以分配。这就需要最有效地利用原料，不断地提高社会劳动生产率和保证全面地满足国民经济的需要；在加强大规模社会主义生产的基础上保证农业生产的进一步增长，大大地提高基本建设的效力，按照所有各个地区的自然和经济条件发展它们的经济，主要是斯洛伐克和边境地区的经济。积极同社会主义阵营国家，尤其是同苏联发展经济合作。
    决议说，中央委员会认为有必要采取进一步的措施，在国民经济的组织、指导和计划方面始终如一地履行民主集中制的原则。在这一方面，它认为应当进一步扩充各企业的管理权，以便它们能够独立地完成它们的任务。特别重要的是，应该要负起以它们各种各样的产品来供应国民经济或它的范围所属的部门和销售它们的产品的责任。
    决议指出，在同意移交管理权和职责的时候，也有必要实行关于设计方法和制度的适当的调整措施。它的重心将由用生产——技术指数来详细规定企业的任务转移到基本指数。通过强调经济指数的办法，将会保证国民经济主要方面的质量的任务的完成以及对国民经济的主要比例的遵守。同时也留出最广泛的可能性，以便企业发挥它的主动性。
    决议着重说，中央委员会强调指出，在实行这些措施时，有必要对目的在削弱有计划的中央领导的原则的趋势进行坚决的斗争，特别是对小资产阶级的自发性的趋势进行斗争，对民主集中制原则的歪曲进行斗争，对低估了人民民主国家在建设社会主义经济的经济和组织活动的决定重要性进行斗争。
    中央委员会认为扩大劳动人民参加管理工作是特别重要的，最好的办法是通过工会组织。
    中央委员会还强调指出有必要在国民经济的各个环节立即实行有效的措施，以便在实现1957年的计划任务时消除严重缺点。
