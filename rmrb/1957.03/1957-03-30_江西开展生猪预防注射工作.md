Jiangxi Carries Out Hog Inoculation Work

　　(Reported) To prevent swine fever and ensure the development of hog production, Jiangxi Province has begun large-scale hog inoculation work.

　　Swine fever and swine erysipelas have been prevalent in Jiangxi Province for decades. They begin every year between April and May and continue until late autumn and early winter, seriously threatening the development of hog production in the province. Since liberation, although a series of measures have been taken to reduce the death of hogs, it is estimated that about 150,000 to 200,000 hogs died from swine fever and swine erysipelas last year alone.

　　In order to stop the prevalence of swine fever and swine erysipelas and vigorously develop hog production, the leading organs of the province have decided that this year, in more than 50 counties (cities) where the above two diseases occur, preventive inoculation will be carried out for hogs raised by state-owned farms, agricultural cooperatives, and cooperative members without cost.

　　At present, all preparations in the province have been basically completed, and many counties have begun preventive inoculation.

　　江西开展生猪预防注射工作
    本报讯  为了防止猪疫，保证生猪生产的发展，江西省已开始进行大面积的生猪预防注射工作。
    猪瘟和猪丹毒病，已经在江西省流行了数十年。每年从4、5月间开始，一直流行到秋末冬初，严重地威胁着这个省的生猪生产的发展。解放以后，虽采取了一系列的措施，使生猪的死亡现象有所减少，但仅去年一年估计因染上猪瘟和猪丹毒病而死亡的猪要达到十五万到二十万头左右。
    为了制止猪瘟和猪丹毒病的流行，大力发展生猪生产，这个省的领导机关决定今年在发生上述两种病的五十多个县（市），不收成本费，为国营农场、农业社及社员所养的生猪进行预防注射工作。
    现在，全省的一切准备工作已基本就绪，并有不少县开始进行预防注射。
