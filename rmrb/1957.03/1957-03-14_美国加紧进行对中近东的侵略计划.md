    U.S. Intensifies its Aggressive Plans Against the Near and Middle East

    The U.S. government, in its reply to the Soviet government on the 11th, rejected the Soviet proposal of February 11 concerning the maintenance of peace and security in the Near and Middle East. Simultaneously, the British and French governments, after conspiring with the United States, also sent replies to the Soviet Union, echoing the U.S. attitude.

    The U.S. government rashly rejected the Soviet proposal without being willing to discuss it. This shows its determination to pursue an aggressive policy in the Near and Middle East region, to undermine peace and security there, and to interfere in the internal affairs of Near and Middle Eastern countries. The ugly face of American colonialism has been exposed once again.

    The Soviet government, in its proposal, put forward six basic principles, requiring the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, to abide by them together. These principles are: to resolve international disputes in the Near and Middle East by peaceful means; not to interfere in the internal affairs of Near and Middle Eastern countries; not to drag Near and Middle Eastern countries into military blocs involving major powers; to abolish foreign military bases on the territory of the Near and Middle East; and to jointly refuse to supply arms to Near and Middle Eastern countries and to promote the economic development of Near and Middle Eastern countries without demanding political or military conditions. If everyone could adhere to these principles, the situation in the Near and Middle East could be eased, and the sovereignty and independence of Near and Middle Eastern countries could be guaranteed. Precisely because of this, the Soviet proposal has been valued and welcomed by the people of the Near and Middle East and the countries of Asia and Africa. Egyptian President Nasser pointed out that the Soviet Union supports the position of the Arab countries. Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar believes that the Soviet proposal can serve as the basis for a policy to ease tensions in the Near and Middle East. Indian Prime Minister Nehru has also repeatedly stated that the Soviet proposal is reasonable and he suggests that U.S. and Soviet leaders hold direct talks.

    However, the United States completely disregarded the wishes of the Near and Middle Eastern countries and the countries of Asia and Africa, and brazenly rejected the Soviet proposal. In its reply to the Soviet Union, the United States dared not touch the substance of the various principles contained in the Soviet proposal, but sophistically insisted that the Soviet proposal to not interfere in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries was an "attempt by great powers to decide on extremely important matters for Middle Eastern countries" and groundlessly said that there were "sufficient reasons to doubt the sincerity of the Soviet government in asking the United States to cooperate with it in the Middle East." This attitude of the United States can only be interpreted as its determination to carry out aggressive plans that endanger the independent sovereignty of the Near and Middle Eastern countries and the peace and security of the region.

    In the resolution recently passed by the U.S. Congress regarding its policy of aggression in the Middle East, it stated menacingly that the United States is prepared to use force in the Middle East, and even deleted the words related to the United Nations that were originally added to the draft resolution to deceive public opinion. This shows that the United States openly disregards the principles of the United Nations Charter regarding the peaceful settlement of international disputes, and attempts to intervene alone in the Near and Middle East or even launch a war. In order to begin implementing this aggressive plan, the United States, in collusion with Britain and France, recently put forward a so-called "temporary plan" to rob Egypt of its sovereignty to collect tolls from the Suez Canal, issued threatening clamors to forcibly implement "freedom of navigation" in the Egyptian territorial waters of the Gulf of Aqaba, and even attempted to use the United Nations Emergency Force to seize Egypt's administrative sovereignty in the Gaza Strip. On February 27th of this year, the heads of state of Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan clearly stated that they would adhere to a policy of active neutrality, and that the defense of Arab countries should be outside the scope of foreign conventions. However, the U.S. government stated in its note to the Soviet Union that it would continue to promote a policy of military alliance that enslaves and divides the unity of Arab countries. All the actions of the United States in the Near and Middle East show that its interference in the affairs of the Near and Middle Eastern countries is so rampant that it treats the sovereign states of the Near and Middle East as if they were colonies of the United States.

    However, the Near and Middle East of today will never allow itself to become a colony of the United States. The people of the Near and Middle Eastern countries are rising up to oppose the "Eisenhower Doctrine," safeguard their national sovereign interests, and defend peace in the Middle East. Although the United States has rejected the Soviet proposal, it cannot reject the determination of the Soviet Union and the people of all countries who support the Soviet proposal to maintain peace in the Near and Middle East and the independence of the Near and Middle Eastern countries.

### 美国加紧进行对中近东的侵略计划

    美国加紧进行对中近东的侵略计划
    美国政府在11日复照苏联政府，拒绝了苏联在2月11日提出的关于维护中近东和平和安全的建议。同时，英法两国政府在和美国进行密谋之后，也向苏联发出复照，附和美国的态度。
    美国政府根本不愿意和苏联进行讨论就轻率地拒绝苏联的建议，这表明它决心要在中近东地区推行侵略政策，破坏中近东和平和安全，干涉中近东各国的内政。美国的殖民主义狰狞面貌，又一次暴露无遗。
    苏联政府在它的建议中曾提出了六项基本原则，要求作为联合国安全理事会的常任理事国的美、英、法和苏联一道遵行。这些原则是：用和平方法解决中近东的国际争端；不干涉中近东国家的内政；不把中近东国家拉入有大国参加的军事集团；撤销中近东领土上的外国军事基地；共同拒绝把武器供给中近东国家和促进中近东国家经济发展而不要索政治、军事条件。如果大家都能够奉行这些原则，中近东的局势就可以导向缓和，中近东国家的主权和独立就能够得到保障。正因为这样，苏联的建议受到了中近东以及亚非地区各国人民的重视和欢迎。埃及总统纳赛尔指出：苏联赞助阿拉伯国家的立场。叙利亚外交部长比塔尔认为，苏联的建议可以作为缓和中近东紧张局势的政策的基础。印度总理尼赫鲁也一再表示苏联的建议是合情合理的，他建议美国和苏联领袖举行直接会谈。
    但是，美国却完全无视中近东国家和亚非国家的愿望，悍然拒绝了苏联的建议。美国在给苏联的复照中，不敢触及苏联这一建议所包含的各个原则的实质，而强词夺理地硬说苏联的主张不干涉中东国家内政的建议是“大国擅自决定中东国家极端重要的事情的企图”，并毫无根据地说什么“有充分理由怀疑苏联政府请美国同它在中东合作的诚意”。美国的这种态度，只可能解释为它决心进行危害中近东各国的独立主权和这个地区的和平安全的侵略计划。
    美国国会最近通过的关于侵略中东政策的决议中，气势汹汹地声称美国准备在中东使用武力，而且把这个决议草案中原来为了欺瞒舆论而加上的有关联合国的字眼也删去了。这表示美国公然无视联合国宪章中有关和平解决国际争端的原则，企图到中近东单独进行干涉甚至发动战争。为了着手实行这个侵略计划，最近美国伙同英法提出了企图劫夺埃及征收苏伊士运河通行税的主权的所谓“临时计划”，发出了要在亚喀巴湾埃及领海强行实行“航行自由”的威胁性叫嚣，甚至企图利用联合国紧急部队攫夺埃及在加沙地带的行政主权。今年2月27日，埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯和约旦四国首脑曾经明确地声明：它们将坚持奉行积极中立政策，阿拉伯国家的防务应当处于外国公约范围之外。可是，美国政府在给苏联的照会中，却表示它将要继续推行奴役和分裂阿拉伯国家团结的军事同盟的政策。美国在中近东的一切行动表明，它对中近东国家的事务的干涉，简直猖狂到把中近东的主权国家当成美国的殖民地那样看待。
    但是，今天的中近东绝不会容许变成美国的殖民地。中近东各国人民正在起来反对“艾森豪威尔主义”，维护自己国家的主权利益，保卫中东的和平。美国尽管拒绝了苏联的建议，它却拒绝不了苏联和支持苏联建议的各国人民维护中近东和平和中近东各国独立的决心。
