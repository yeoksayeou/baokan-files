Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The All-China Democratic Women's Federation issued a notice on the 14th to all levels of women's federations regarding the mobilization of rural women to raise pigs extensively.

The notice stated that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued a decision on February 28 concerning the development of pig production. This decision will have a tremendous impact on increasing the enthusiasm of farmers in pig production, helping farmers overcome difficulties in pig production, and greatly developing pig production. This will, in turn, be conducive to increasing agricultural production, improving the meat supply for urban and rural people, and promoting the development of national construction. Therefore, women's federations at all levels should conscientiously publicize and implement this decision, and fully mobilize women to consciously and actively raise more pigs.

The notice requires women's federations at all levels to focus on the following three tasks:

One, it is necessary to explain to the vast number of rural women the important significance of developing pig production and the principle that raising pigs is the glorious responsibility of rural women. It should be explained that this production has always been undertaken by rural women, and now, according to the Party and the government's principle of private raising as the mainstay, it is easiest to give play to women's special skills and pig-raising habits. Therefore, it is necessary to educate women to work hard, overcome difficulties, give play to their enthusiasm and initiative in raising pigs, and consciously raise more fat pigs.

Two, it is necessary to specifically explain to women the benefits of raising pigs, explaining that raising more pigs is beneficial to farmers' families, as well as to urban and rural people and national construction. Women's federations at all levels should carry out vivid and specific publicity and explanations aimed at the ideological concerns and practical problems of the local women masses regarding pig production, so that everyone understands the benefits of raising pigs and everyone starts raising fat pigs.

Three, it is necessary to regularly publicize and introduce model pig raisers and model deeds, promote their experience in overcoming difficulties, producing, collecting, and arranging feed, and constantly use concrete examples to encourage the masses' enthusiasm for raising pigs and improve their pig-raising skills. Women's federations at all levels should be good at discovering and helping the masses summarize experience, promote good experiences, carry out specific demonstrations, use the wisdom of the masses, and organize the strength of the masses to solve the difficult problems that can be solved.

The notice concluded by saying that women's federations in various localities can unite with relevant departments to convene meetings of pig-raising activists, women's representative meetings at appropriate times, organize exchanges of experience, and expand publicity on the benefits of raising pigs. They can also promote and assist relevant departments in holding pig-raising technical training courses to cultivate technical backbones to impart technology. Various forms should be used to spread good experiences among the masses.

    全国妇联通知各级妇联组织
    发动农村妇女大量养猪
    新华社16日讯　中华全国民主妇女联合会14日向各级妇联组织发出关于发动农村妇女大量养猪的通知。
    通知中说，中共中央和国务院2月28日发出了关于发展养猪生产的决定，对于提高农民养猪生产的积极性，帮助农民克服养猪生产的困难，大量发展养猪生产将产生巨大的作用，从而也就有利于增加农业生产，改善城乡人民的肉食供应和促进国家建设事业的发展。因此各级妇联组织应当认真地宣传贯彻这个决定，充分发动妇女自觉地积极地多养猪。
    通知要求各级妇联着重进行下列三项工作：
    一、要向广大农村妇女说明发展养猪生产的重要意义和养猪是农村妇女的光荣责任的道理。说明这项生产历来就是由农村妇女担负的，现在根据党和政府以私养为主的方针，最便于发挥妇女的特长和养猪习惯。因此必须教育妇女艰苦劳动，克服困难，发挥养猪的积极性和主动精神，自觉的多养肥猪。
    二、要具体地向妇女说明养猪的好处，说明多养猪既有利农民家庭，又有利城乡人民和国家建设。各级妇联要针对当地妇女群众对养猪生产的思想顾虑和实际存在的问题，进行生动的具体的宣传解释，使人人懂得养猪的好处，人人动手养肥猪。
    三、要经常宣传介绍养猪模范人物及模范事迹，推广她们克服困难，生产、采集和安排饲料的经验，不断地用具体事例鼓舞群众养猪的积极性，提高养猪的本领。各级妇联要善于发现和帮助群众总结经验，推广好的经验，进行具体的示范，运用群众的智慧，组织群众的力量解决可能解决的困难问题。
    通知最后说，各地妇联可以联合有关部门，选择适当的时机召开养猪积极分子会议、妇女代表会议，组织经验交流，扩大宣传养猪的好处。还可以推动协助有关部门举办养猪技术训练班，培养传授技术的骨干。运用多种多样的形式，传播群众中好的经验。
