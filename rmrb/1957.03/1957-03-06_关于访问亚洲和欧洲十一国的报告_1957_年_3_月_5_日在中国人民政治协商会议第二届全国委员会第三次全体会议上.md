Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 5th.

The second session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is now in session.

Since our last plenary meeting, more than a year has passed. With the further development of our country's socialist cause, our national united front of people's democracy has become even more consolidated and expanded. This fact is reflected in our current meeting. The National Committee originally had 664 members, with 11 deceased and 76 new members added. The number of committee members attending this meeting, excluding 108 who requested leave, is 621, the highest attendance ever.

Before this meeting, members of the National Committee were invited to attend an expanded meeting of the State Council. Chairman Mao Zedong delivered an important speech on correctly handling contradictions among the people. At our preparatory meeting, we listened to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of several issues related to the draft of the Second Five-Year Plan. Everyone conducted group discussions on Chairman Mao's speech and Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation. At this meeting, there will be special speeches on topics such as increased production and savings, agricultural issues, judicial and legal work, and education. These are urgent and important issues in our country's current work that everyone is concerned about. We hope that this meeting will continue to uphold the democratic traditions of the People's Political Consultative Conference, fully and frankly discuss and exchange views on various important aspects of our country's work, and put forward active and practical suggestions.

Recently, Vice Premier He Long and I, on behalf of the Chinese government, visited eleven countries in Asia and Europe. I will take this opportunity to report to the National Committee of the Political Consultative Conference and the people of the country about the results of our visit, and also discuss the current international situation and our country's foreign policy.

The Chinese government has always attached great importance to mutual friendly visits between countries, especially the contact between leaders of various countries, which plays an important role in easing international tensions and strengthening mutual understanding and trust between countries. Not long ago, the Chinese government was very pleased to accept the invitations from the governments of eleven countries in Asia and Europe, and entrusted Vice Premier He Long and me to visit the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Republic of India, the Union of Burma, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the People's Republic of Poland, the People's Republic of Hungary, the Kingdom of Afghanistan, the Kingdom of Nepal, and Ceylon for friendly visits. During our visits to the Soviet Union, Poland, and Hungary, the Chinese government delegation also included Vice Minister Wang Jiaxiang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and our ambassadors to the respective countries. The duration of this visit was from November 18, 1956, to February 5, 1957, with a return to the country in between, totaling nearly eighty days, and the entire journey covered approximately 54,000 kilometers.

In all eleven countries, the enthusiastic and grand welcome from the people, and the solemn and cordial reception from the governments and leaders, have left us with deep and unforgettable impressions. Leaders of many countries personally accompanied us to various places within their countries for visits and inspections. In many places we visited, whether day or night, tens of thousands of people, regardless of the heat or cold, came out to cheer for us, welcoming us with colorful national ceremonies, waving or hanging the national flags of China and their own countries, and bestowing various high honors upon us.

The welcome and reception we received in the eleven countries were not just for us personally. All of this actually reflected the friendship of the peoples of these countries towards liberated China and their love for the victorious Chinese people. All the honors we received should be attributed to our great motherland and our great people. Now, when I report the results of the visit to the people of the country, I first want to convey the deep friendship of the peoples of the eleven countries to the 600 million Chinese people, and on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, once again express our sincere thanks to the governments and peoples of these countries.

We went to visit these countries with the purpose of seeking friendship, seeking peace, and seeking knowledge. We can say that these purposes have been achieved. We hope that this visit will help strengthen the unity of Asian countries, better fight for the consolidation of national independence and against colonialism; help strengthen the unity of socialist countries, better strive for the socialist cause; help strengthen the unity of all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, better fight for the defense of world peace.

We had cordial, sincere, and friendly talks with the leaders of the eleven countries and issued joint communiqués or joint statements with the governments of ten countries. During our visit to the Soviet Union, we also held talks with the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, which was visiting the Soviet Union at the time, and issued a joint communiqué. Through these contacts and talks, we have a deeper understanding of the importance of maintaining regular contact between the leaders of various countries. We inspected many aspects of the lives and work of the peoples of the eleven countries and, through our contacts with politicians and people from various walks of life in these countries, made many friends. During the visit, we had many opportunities to interact with the press of various countries and, through them, explained the positions of the Chinese government on many major international issues to the peoples of various countries, expressing the Chinese people's desire for peaceful and friendly relations with the peoples of various countries.

Through this series of activities during the visit, we not only felt the friendship of the peoples of all eleven countries towards the Chinese people but also felt their desire to be friends with the peoples of the world. We also felt the will of the peoples of all these countries to engage in peaceful construction and maintain world peace. We also saw the efforts and achievements of the peoples of all these countries in peaceful construction and found that these countries, whether in their excellent national culture or in their current construction achievements, have many things worth learning from. Of course, it is impossible to conduct in-depth learning in the short time we visited each country. However, we believe that this visit has created good conditions for us to continue learning from these countries in the future.

It should be pointed out that our visit abroad was at a time when the imperialist forces of aggression were launching attacks on the socialist camp and the anti-colonial national independence movements, trying to create new tensions. At the same time, it was also a time when contradictions between imperialist countries were becoming more acute. However, it was at this time that the imperialist forces of aggression suffered serious setbacks in their subversive activities in Hungary and their armed attacks on Egypt. In the four socialist countries and seven Asian nationalist countries that make up nearly one-third of the world's population, we saw that the people strongly opposed war, colonialism, and subversive activities. The imperialist policy of aggression and war has become more and more unpopular, while the forces of peace and progress are becoming stronger and more consolidated. Although these countries, like ours, have encountered and will inevitably encounter various difficulties and setbacks in the past and future, these are difficulties and setbacks in the process of advancement. The socialist forces and national independence forces that break through these difficulties and setbacks will become even stronger; while the imperialist forces will continue to weaken, and their conflicts of interest will become even more acute. The course of history is irreversible. The overall trend of the world is towards easing and progress.

Now, I will first talk about our visit to the four socialist countries.

From November 18 to November 22, 1956, we spent four days visiting the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a brotherly country on the front line of the struggle against imperialism. The fact that Vietnam is still in a state of division cannot but bring difficulties to the reform and construction work of the Vietnamese people. However, the Vietnamese people, who have grown through struggle, have never bowed to difficulties. During our visit, we saw that in the two and a half years since the war, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the Vietnamese Democratic Republic government, and Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people have made great achievements in healing the wounds of war and building the northern part of Vietnam. The land reform work has basically achieved victory, and the errors in the work are being corrected. The work of economic recovery will be basically completed this year. At the same time, new socialist construction has begun. Although due to the sabotage by the United States and the opposition by the authorities in the south, the Vietnamese people have not yet completed the cause of peaceful reunification of the motherland, the achievements made in the construction of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are pointing the way of independent development for the Vietnamese people from north to south. What impressed us the most was the hardworking, diligent, and simple style of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese Labor Party, and the Vietnamese people, which is particularly worth learning from.

In Hanoi, we visited factories, schools, and children's clubs, and appreciated Vietnamese national art. We also visited the temple of the two Vietnamese national heroes, Trieu Thi Trinh and Trieu Thi Nhi, who had fought against the Chinese feudal dynasty's invasion of Vietnam more than 1,900 years ago. We paid tribute to the statues of these two Vietnamese national heroes by laying flowers. In our meetings with Chairman Ho Chi Minh, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, and other leaders of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and in our contacts with people from various circles in Vietnam, we felt the fraternal comradeship of the Vietnamese people towards the Chinese people at every moment.

From January 7 to January 10, and from January 17 to January 19, 1957, we spent a total of six days visiting the Soviet Union. We paid a courtesy call on Chairman Voroshilov and had cordial talks with Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Khrushchev, and other Soviet leaders, and issued a comprehensive joint statement on current international issues.

During our visit to the Soviet Union, what moved us the most was the boundless fraternal friendship of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people. About our meeting this time, Comrade Khrushchev said it best. He said, "We have the right to call this meeting 'the festival of spring' and 'the festival of the eternal and unbreakable friendship and prosperity between our brotherly peoples.'" Indeed, although the natural climate during our visit to the Soviet Union was below zero, the warmth of the socialist family we received from the Soviet people made us feel like it was spring. Through this visit, we, together with the Soviet people, once again demonstrated to the world the close friendship and solid unity between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, which no force can separate.

In the Soviet Union, we visited enterprises, farms, schools, and the armed forces. We saw with our own eyes that the cause of communist construction in the Soviet Union has made a great leap forward. The national strength of the Soviet Union is becoming even stronger, and Soviet science and technology are reaching new heights. In our contacts with Soviet leaders and people from various walks of life, we felt that the criticism of errors and shortcomings in their work has had a promoting effect on all aspects of Soviet life and work. Before leaving the Soviet Union, we had the opportunity to stay briefly in Tashkent, the capital of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. This republic, which has made a great contribution to cotton cultivation, recently received the Order of Lenin. In Tashkent, we visited a collective farm and had a concrete understanding of the comprehensive development and prosperity of this republic in the economic and cultural fields. The achievements of this republic vividly prove the superiority of the socialist system and the great success of the correct national policy implemented by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government.

From January 11 to January 16, 1957, we visited the People's Republic of Poland. In Warsaw, we paid a courtesy call on Chairman of the State Council Bierut and had cordial talks with Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party Gomulka, and other leaders, and visited factories. In addition, we also went to Krakow, the ancient capital of Poland, Nowa Huta, the center of steel production, Wroclaw, the industrial base in western Poland, and Lodz, the second largest city and famous center of the workers' movement. We saw with our own eyes that in less than twelve years, the Polish people, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish government, have laid the foundation for socialism. This basic achievement should not be underestimated in any way.

Although there have been some errors and deviations in Poland's political and economic life in the past, we are pleased to see that the Polish United Workers' Party, under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrade Gomulka, is correcting the dogmatic errors made by the past leadership and at the same time opposing revisionist errors. They are strengthening domestic and party unity, strengthening the party's ties with the people, and striving to improve Poland's relations with other socialist countries, especially with the Soviet Union. The Polish working people, with their glorious history of struggle, are working with great enthusiasm to maintain and develop Poland's socialist cause.

The internationalist spirit of the Polish people left a very deep impression on us. We can still clearly recall the moving scenes we saw many times in various places in Poland. Despite the heavy snow, people came out in droves to welcome us. They gathered from all directions, vying to offer us flowers and shake our hands. They sang the famous folk song "Let him live among us for a hundred years," expressing their welcome. Such a scene is something we will never forget.

Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz has accepted our invitation and will visit China in April this year.

After visiting Poland, we spent one day in Budapest, the capital of the People's Republic of Hungary, from January 16 to January 17. We paid a courtesy call on Chairman Dobi and had cordial talks with Prime Minister Kadar and other leaders. Before this, representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties and governments of Hungary, China, and the Soviet Union had held talks in Moscow on January 10 and issued a joint communiqué on the three-country talks.

We visited Budapest shortly after the Hungarian people, with the help of the Soviet army, suppressed the armed rebellion of the counter-revolutionaries. However, we found that the Hungarian people, under the leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party and the revolutionary government of workers and peasants, were quickly restoring social order and economic life. We saw that most of the factories had resumed work, traffic in the city had been restored, shops were operating as usual, and people's lives were returning to normal.

In Budapest, we attended the first meeting held since the October events last year, which was attended by more than a thousand activists from various parts of Hungary, and spoke at the meeting. This was an exciting gathering. Those who spoke at the meeting included Prime Minister Kadar, workers, members of agricultural production cooperatives, and primary school teachers. From their speeches, it can be seen that the Socialist Workers' Party, the revolutionary government of workers and peasants, and all healthy democratic forces led by the Hungarian working class have not underestimated the many arduous and complex tasks still before them. They all correctly emphasized that the most important task at present is to implement effective proletarian dictatorship, eliminate counter-revolutionaries; strengthen ideological education, help the people distinguish between enemies and friends, right and wrong, and strengthen the party's and government's ties with the masses; further restore and increase production, overcome temporary economic difficulties.

Although we only stayed in Budapest for one day, we already had an indelible impression that the Hungarian people are resolutely correcting all the mistakes of the past leadership, determined to defend the achievements of socialist construction with all their might, and unshakably maintain the unity of the socialist camp. We believe that the entire socialist camp will draw profound lessons from the Hungarian incident, avoid repeating the mistakes made by the past leadership of Hungary. At the same time, the spirit of the Hungarian people, who were not overwhelmed by serious setbacks but stood up firmly, is worthy of our admiration.

To promote our common socialist cause, socialist countries need to strive to learn from each other and complement each other's strengths and weaknesses. China is still backward in many aspects and lacks experience, so it is even more necessary to continue learning from other socialist countries, especially from the most advanced socialist country, the Soviet Union. One of the main purposes of our visit to socialist countries this time is also to learn from the advanced experience of these countries. Chairman Mao warned us not to become arrogant and complacent because of the victory of the revolution and some achievements in construction. Chairman Mao also reminded us that humility makes one progress, while arrogance makes one fall behind. We should always remember this truth.

Our visit to the four socialist countries has made us even more convinced of the superiority of the socialist system. The economies of our socialist countries are becoming more and more prosperous. The friendly and mutually supportive relations between our socialist countries are being further improved and strengthened. Our socialist countries all adhere to the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. We believe that in the face of the increasingly powerful and united socialist camp, all the destructive plots of the imperialist aggression bloc are doomed to fail.

Under the socialist system, the working people truly grasp their own destiny, eliminate the phenomenon of man exploiting man, and therefore, the socialist system can fully mobilize the initiative and creativity of the people, greatly promote the development of productive forces. This is what we often say, and the actual situation is indeed so. As for the four socialist countries we visited, the social productive forces of each country have developed greatly compared to the past. If we compare the total industrial output in 1956 with the past, then the Soviet Union has reached thirty times the level of 1913 before the October Revolution, Poland has reached more than five times the level before World War II, Hungary has reached more than three times the pre-war level, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has reached more than four times the level of 1955. In other socialist countries, the situation is the same. The socialist system not only guarantees the continuous growth of productive forces but also ensures that this growth serves the ever-increasing needs of the entire society. This contrasts sharply with the extremely unstable development of productive forces under the capitalist system and the situation where production is only for the maximum profit of a small number of people in society. All of this shows the incomparable superiority of the socialist system.

Of course, the superiority of the socialist system does not mean that we have no difficulties in our work and can guarantee that we will not make mistakes. The socialist system is a new social system. Even under the socialist system, there are still contradictions between production relations and productive forces, between the superstructure and the economic base, which need to be adjusted in a timely manner. Moreover, the history of socialist countries is still short, some have only a few years or a dozen years, the longest does not exceed forty years. Therefore, it is impossible to avoid difficulties and mistakes in work. There have been difficulties and mistakes in the past, and there will be difficulties and mistakes in the future. However, from the entire past period, the achievements are fundamental in socialist countries. With the accumulation of experience and the test of practice, socialist countries will be able to better adjust the contradictions among the people, so that these contradictions will not turn into antagonistic contradictions, and we will be able to better overcome the difficulties in work and reduce the mistakes in work. Only the party of the working class and the state led by the working class can consciously recognize the mistakes in their work and bravely expose and correct these mistakes, making the great socialist cause develop more healthily. All of this is where the socialist system is incomparably superior to any old social system.

All reactionary forces in the world see that our socialist countries have difficulties and mistakes, and they rejoice at the misfortune, and they foolishly try to use these difficulties and mistakes to carry out sabotage activities. However, all of this will be in vain. Through the continuous overcoming of difficulties and the correction of mistakes, our socialist cause will not only not be weakened but will definitely be more consolidated and prosperous.

The socialist countries are united by the common ideal and goal of communism, so their relations are based on the principle of proletarian internationalism. The socialist countries are also independent sovereign states, so their relations are also based on the Marxist-Leninist principle of national equality. There are no fundamental contradictions and conflicts of interest between the socialist countries. Unlike the relationship of mutual exclusion and mutual annexation between imperialist countries, the relationship of unity and mutual assistance between socialist countries is a completely new type of international relationship. The Soviet Union is not only the first victorious socialist country but also the most powerful and experienced socialist country. It has always provided the greatest assistance to other socialist countries. Therefore, the Soviet Union naturally becomes the center of unity for socialist countries. And the friendly unity between China and the Soviet Union is an extremely important part of the great unity of socialist countries. We often say that the close unity and friendly mutual assistance between socialist countries is the most reliable guarantee for the socialist cause and a powerful force for consolidating world peace. Through this visit, we have a deeper understanding of this point.

In the relations between socialist countries, unity and mutual assistance have always been the main and basic aspects. However, precisely because this relationship is a completely new type of relationship, it lacks sufficient experience, so in the mutual relations between socialist countries, it cannot be said that everything is perfect and normal. The tendency of great-power chauvinism or narrow nationalism in the mutual relations between socialist countries has caused some estrangement and misunderstandings between socialist countries. Now, these shortcomings and mistakes are being overcome. The Soviet government issued a declaration on October 30, 1956, expressing its willingness to develop and further strengthen friendship and cooperation with other socialist countries on the basis of complete equality, respect for territorial integrity, national independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs. This has great significance for correcting the mistakes in the mutual relations between socialist countries and for strengthening the unity between socialist countries. The Chinese government issued a statement on November 1, 1956, supporting this declaration of the Soviet government. In our visit to socialist countries this time, we again expressed our deep desire to further strengthen the unity of socialist countries. Our desire has found resonance in every socialist country we visited.

In recent periods, in addition to our visit to socialist countries, many other socialist countries have also held bilateral or multilateral talks and issued related joint statements and communiqués. All of this shows that socialist countries are jointly working to improve mutual relations and strengthen unity.

The socialist countries all take Marxism-Leninism as their common guiding ideology, which is the basis for our unity on principle. However, this does not mean that we socialist countries, while being united on principle, have the same views on all issues at all times. Differences of opinion on certain issues are secondary to our main aspects of unity on principle. Moreover, such differences of opinion can be gradually resolved on the basis of Marxism-Leninism through comradely discussions and consultations. Even if a consensus cannot be reached temporarily, as long as the relationship of unity is cherished, it is normal to retain such differences of opinion.

Imperialist countries are accustomed to using their own mutual relations to measure the relations between socialist countries. They attempt to use the problems in the mutual relations of socialist countries and certain differences of opinion between socialist countries to sow discord and break up the unity of socialist countries, and to intensify their subversive activities against socialist countries. The counter-revolutionary rebellion they instigated in Hungary most clearly exposed their evil intention of trying to break through Hungary to individually defeat socialist countries. However, the unity between socialist countries is unbreakable. The Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to aid the Hungarian people in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion and the support and aid of the socialist camp countries to the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government led by Comrade Kadar fully proved that socialist countries are loyal to the principles of proletarian internationalism. The evil intentions of imperialist countries to destroy socialist countries have suffered shameful failures in the past and will continue to suffer shameful failures in the future.

Socialist countries have always advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems in the world, and not using force to resolve international disputes. We know that since there are different social systems, peaceful coexistence means peaceful competition between countries with different systems in politics, economics, and culture. We are confident in the superiority of the socialist system and dare to engage in such peaceful competition.

Our socialist countries will never expand outward and will never invade other countries. We believe that revolution cannot be exported, and we advocate that the people of each country choose their own political system. We are willing to mutually guarantee non-aggression and peaceful coexistence with imperialist countries. We believe that this advocacy not only points out a path in the current international relations that is in the interests of all the people of the world, but is also the most realistic for imperialist countries. However, if the imperialist aggression bloc does not want to take this path and dares to invade socialist countries, then, as pointed out in the Sino-Soviet Joint Statement of January 18, 1957, "China and the Soviet Union have fraternal friendship and the obligation of mutual assistance with all socialist countries. Any provocative acts by the imperialist aggression bloc to disrupt socialist countries will be met with the most resolute rebuff."

Comrades and friends: Our socialist countries represent the new forces of the world and symbolize the bright future of mankind. Justice and progress are on our side, and our cause is bound to be victorious. However, we are also clearly aware that although we are willing to coexist peacefully with all countries, imperialism is still threatening us with war. We must always remain vigilant and, while further developing our economy, continue to strengthen our national defense. The invincible, united socialist camp led by the Soviet Union is invincible.

Now, I will talk about our visit to the seven Asian nationalist countries.

After leaving the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, we arrived in the Kingdom of Cambodia on November 22, 1956. We went there as guests of the King and Queen of Cambodia to repay Prince Sihanouk's visit to China in February 1956. There, we received a grand and solemn reception. This reception, as well as the personal care of the King, Queen, and Prince Sihanouk throughout the visit, and the great enthusiasm of the Cambodian people towards us, deeply moved us.

We must admit that our original understanding of this neighboring country was very inadequate. Through a five-day visit, as stated in the joint statement issued by me and Prime Minister San Yat of Cambodia, we had the opportunity to further understand and learn from each other. We saw that the Cambodian people have had a fraternal relationship with the Chinese people since ancient times. Now, among the five million Cambodian residents, there are more than 300,000 Chinese residents. We are very pleased that the barriers caused by colonial rule between us have been eliminated with our respective independence, and that these two neighboring countries have established a friendly relationship that has never existed before.

We went to Phnom Penh, Pursat, Siem Reap, and Prek Kdam, and saw that Cambodia is a country with beautiful scenery and abundant resources. The Cambodian people, after gaining independence, are beginning to develop these rich resources. The ancient temple of Angkor Wat near Siem Reap, with a history of a thousand years, is a masterpiece of world art, which deeply admires the creative talent of the Cambodian people.

The Royal Government of Cambodia is implementing the policy of peaceful neutrality and independence formulated by Prince Sihanouk. We believe that in the cause of maintaining peace, the friendship between China and Cambodia will continue to develop.

From November 28 to December 10, 1956, we spent twelve days visiting the Republic of India. This was our second visit to this great neighboring country. The first time was in June 1954, when, due to the ongoing Geneva Conference, we could only stay in Delhi for three days, so we did not have the opportunity to understand the various aspects of Indian people's lives. In this visit, thanks to the care and arrangements of President Prasad and Prime Minister Nehru, we visited Delhi, Pune, Mumbai, Bangalore, Madras, Asansol, Chittaranjan, Sindri, and Kolkata, which can be said to be major cities and industrial centers throughout this subcontinent. We saw the beautiful and rich culture created by the Indian people in their long history, and at the same time, we also saw the many achievements of the Indian people in building a modern country, in industry, science, and technology. The Chinese people can learn a lot from our Indian friends in many aspects.

The enthusiasm of the Indian people in welcoming us is indescribable in words. Perhaps I can use a few figures to give a simple explanation: In Delhi, hundreds of thousands of people came to the citizen's rally to welcome us; in Kolkata, more than a million people participated in the citizen's rally; in Mumbai, Madras, and other cities, and on the 150-kilometer road from Asansol to Chittaranjan to Sindri in the industrial area of northeastern India, people lined up continuously to welcome us. Wherever we went, we heard the warm cheers of "Indo-China, brothers forever."

During the entire period of our visits to various countries in Asia, we passed through India four times, twice through Delhi and twice through Kolkata, and each time we received warm hospitality from the Indian government and people, which made us deeply grateful.

The first time we passed through Delhi was during the New Year. Prime Minister Nehru accompanied us to visit the Bakra-Nangal hydroelectric power station, one of the highest dams in the world at the time, with a very grand scale. When we passed through Kolkata at the end of January this year, we also visited the Peace Village near Kolkata, where the great Indian writer Tagore founded the International University.

During our three visits to Delhi, we had talks with Prime Minister Nehru each time, exchanging views on many issues of interest to both sides, and reaching a consensus on many issues. We believe that such friendly and cordial talks are very beneficial. Of course, China and India are not, and cannot be, the same in all issues, but as Prime Minister Nehru said during our visit to India: "Our differences on some issues are friendly differences and do not hinder our friendly cooperation." Such talks deepened our mutual understanding. This will be more conducive to our two countries playing their respective roles in maintaining world peace and promoting international cooperation from their respective positions. The friendly cooperative relationship that has long existed between our two countries in this regard will definitely be further strengthened in the future.

Next, we visited the Union of Burma, which was also our second visit. From December 10 to December 20, 1956, we went to Yangon, Mandalay, Mawlamyine, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina, Myitkyina

During our visit to Pakistan, we had frank discussions with President Mirza, Prime Minister Suhrawardy, and other leaders. Through these candid talks, our two countries gained a better understanding of each other's views on many issues. Everyone knows that our views on certain issues differ. For example, Pakistan joined the Manila Treaty and the Baghdad Pact, while we oppose these treaties. However, we still share a common desire to promote world peace and further develop the existing friendly relations between China and Pakistan.

Afghanistan was the first country we visited after leaving Europe. We arrived there on January 19 of this year and stayed for five days. Although we were visiting this neighbor to the southwest of the Pamir Plateau for the first time, the country was not unfamiliar to us. Trade and cultural exchanges between ancient China and countries in West Asia, South Asia, and even Europe often passed through Afghanistan. In this place, which was once a center of ancient East-West communications, we can still see many relics that symbolize Sino-Afghan friendship.

In Afghanistan, we were warmly received by King Mohammed Zahir Shah, Prime Minister Daoud Khan, and other government leaders. During our visit to Afghanistan, we toured many historical sites in Kabul and Kandahar. The heroic history of the Afghan people's resolute resistance and victory against imperialist aggression to defend their national independence left a particularly deep impression on us. We also visited the Shalobi hydroelectric power station near Kabul and the Helmand River Valley irrigation project near Kandahar. The Afghan people's determination to build their country under difficult conditions earned our great respect. We sincerely wish for their efforts to succeed.

While in Kabul, we had friendly discussions with Prime Minister Daoud Khan and other leaders of the Afghan government. Prime Minister Daoud Khan has accepted our invitation, and we welcome him to visit China soon.

From January 25 to 29 of this year, we visited the Kingdom of Nepal. The Chinese people know that Nepal is an ancient country where Buddhism originated over 2,500 years ago. Although the world's highest Himalayas stand between China and Nepal, they have not prevented our two peoples from maintaining friendly exchanges since ancient times. Three months before our visit to Nepal, Nepal's Prime Minister Acharya had visited China. This exchange signifies that the ancient friendship between China and Nepal has developed anew.

In Nepal, we visited the capital, Kathmandu, known as the "City of Glory," Lalitpur, known as the "City of Beauty," and Bhaktapur, known as the "City of Devotion." This is a land of fertile soil and beautiful scenery. We believe that the construction efforts of the Nepalese people have a bright future.

The Nepalese people gave us a warm, brotherly welcome. King Mahendra and Queen Ratna gave us a cordial reception. Prime Minister Acharya and we had friendly and sincere discussions. We reaffirmed our two countries' desire to promote Sino-Nepalese friendship, Asian-African solidarity, and the cause of world peace.

Our last stop on this visit was Ceylon. This is also a country with a long history of ties to China. In recent years, our trade of rice for rubber has been highly beneficial to the economies of both countries, leaving a deep impression on our peoples. We met Governor-General Oliver Goonetilleke, Prime Minister Bandaranaike, and other leaders of the Ceylonese government for the first time, but we felt like old friends. The Ceylonese people gave us the warmest welcome. During our extensive travels on the island, we were greeted by thousands of people cheering for friendship wherever we went.

Besides the capital Colombo, we visited the ancient cities of Kandy and Polonnaruwa. We saw that this fertile and beautiful island nation is truly a pearl in the Indian Ocean. The Ceylonese people have achieved remarkable accomplishments in ancient times; now, after breaking free from over 400 years of colonial rule, they are creating their new lives with great enthusiasm. They are friends worthy of our admiration.

We are pleased to see that the Ceylonese government and people are pursuing an independent policy of maintaining peace. The discussions between Prime Minister Bandaranaike and us yielded very satisfactory results. We advocate the implementation of the Five Principles, the strengthening of Asian-African solidarity, the peaceful coexistence of countries with different systems, the peaceful resolution of international disputes, support for disarmament, the prohibition of nuclear weapons, opposition to the establishment of hostile military alliances, opposition to the so-called "vacuum" theory, and opposition to hegemony. We believe that the realization of these principles will help strengthen world peace.

We are particularly pleased that China and Ceylon have now established formal diplomatic relations. Prime Minister Bandaranaike has also agreed to visit China this year, and we look forward to welcoming him again in Beijing.

After recounting our visit to seven nationalist countries in Asia and Africa, I would like to mention that in most of these countries, there are a significant number of overseas Chinese. They welcomed us, their fellow countrymen from the motherland, with great enthusiasm. They, along with the local people, have long suffered from the exploitation and oppression of colonialism. Now, the achievements of the People's Republic of China in all aspects make them happy and proud. I must convey to everyone the longing and respect of the overseas Chinese in South Asia for their motherland. We have also, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, expressed our greetings to them and encouraged them to respect the laws and customs of their host countries, strengthen friendship with the local people, and work to promote friendly relations between China and their host countries.

Comrades, friends: Now I would like to share some of my thoughts and opinions from our visits to these countries.

When we visited these countries, no matter where we went, we had a very warm feeling. In these countries, we did not feel like we were in a strange foreign land, but rather like we were in the homes of close friends, relatives, and brothers.

This feeling arose not only because we were warmly and enthusiastically welcomed everywhere, but also because we personally experienced that the historical experiences of these countries are roughly the same as ours, and their national aspirations are also roughly the same as ours.

During this visit, in every country, we visited many meaningful historical sites. They told us that the Asian people have a glorious history and have made great contributions to humanity. At the same time, in the places we visited, we could also see that there has been a long and close historical connection between the Asian peoples. In the dawn of history, we began to have exchanges. However, after the expansion of Western colonialism to the East, suffering befell this continent, which once illuminated the ancient world with its wisdom. Except for Japan, almost all Asian countries have successively become colonies of Western imperialist countries or been under their control. Our nations suffered humiliation. Our people were enslaved. The political, economic, and cultural development of each of us was suppressed and destroyed. The connections we had formed over thousands of years were artificially severed. This shared suffering fostered sympathy among the peoples of our countries, and our struggles against a common enemy further deepened this sympathy.

Our long, arduous struggle against colonialism finally achieved victory after World War II. The colonial system began to disintegrate under the repeated impact of this struggle. In Asia and Africa, one after another, countries that had become colonies gained independence, and countries that had been under foreign control shook off their shackles. Now, when we can freely seek friendship, we naturally place great enthusiasm in our fellow brothers who have shared our hardships. This is a precious historical sentiment that should be cherished forever.

Of course, the paths to independence taken by Asian and African countries are not the same. The Chinese people, the Mongolian people, the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam achieved independence under the leadership of communists, and these countries' peoples have embarked on the socialist road. Other many Asian and African countries' peoples achieved independence and development under the leadership of nationalists. We do not hide the fact that our social and political systems are different, and our views on many issues also differ. However, this difference does not hinder our friendly cooperation. All the peoples of the Asian and African countries that have gained independence demand the consolidation of their independence, demand the maintenance of world peace, and demand the enhancement of friendly cooperation among our countries. In these aspects, our wishes are the same.

All the peoples of the countries we visited have made great sacrifices to achieve political independence for their countries. They cherish their independence, and like the Chinese people, they also believe that the independence of our countries is still not secure because colonialist forces still threaten and harm our independence from all sides. We must continue to struggle tirelessly to maintain our sovereignty and independence. At the same time, the independence of our countries is still incomplete; we have not yet shaken off the economic and cultural backwardness left by colonialism. Therefore, we all want to build our countries and catch up with the level of modern countries. Only in this way can our independence be truly consolidated. In addition, there are still many countries in the Asian and African regions that have not gained independence, and the struggle of their peoples for independence is still being brutally suppressed by colonialism. The peoples of the already independent Asian and African countries sympathize with and support their struggle.

All the peoples of the countries we visited yearn for peace and hate war. The Asian and African peoples have suffered enough from wars of aggression in the past few hundred years. No Asian and African country that has just freed itself from colonial oppression wants to be drawn into war again. On the contrary, only in a peaceful international environment can the Asian and African peoples build their countries and achieve stable and happy lives. However, today, colonialists are still using the hostile military alliances and military bases they organize in Asia and Africa to control the politics and economies of some countries in the region, making these countries' peoples bear heavy military expenses and threatening the peace and security of the entire Asian and African region. This situation makes the Asian and African peoples more eager for peace. It is precisely for this reason that during this visit, wherever we went, when thousands and thousands of people came to welcome us, "peace" was always the most prominent and loudest slogan.

All the peoples of the countries we visited also want friendly cooperation with the peoples of other Asian countries. In each country, the enthusiastic welcome of thousands and thousands of people to us was not only an expression of the friendship of these countries' peoples for the Chinese people but also an expression of the desire of the Asian peoples to strengthen friendly cooperation among themselves. Friendly cooperation is in the common interest of the Asian peoples. The forces of colonialism and war have not yet given up on their failure and are still looking for every opportunity to launch new attacks on the Asian peoples. They particularly hope to use our differences to achieve their ambitions. "Divide and rule," "Asians fighting Asians," has never been a plot they have given up. In the face of such threats, the Asian and African countries can only unite and cooperate in friendship to have the strength to defend their independence and to have the strength to maintain the peace of Asia and the world.

Of course, we also see that there are differences and disputes between Asian and African countries, but it can be said that almost all these differences and disputes are the result of the colonialists' long-term policy of "divide and rule" or are the result of their policy being expanded. Colonialists still want to sow discord among us to create opportunities for themselves. We believe that all the unresolved problems between Asian and African countries should be resolved through peaceful negotiations in a fair and reasonable manner and should not allow any differences and disputes to hinder our unity.

In the current relations among Asian countries, the Kashmir issue between India and Pakistan has caused deep concern among neighboring countries. We have expressed to the leaders of India and Pakistan the hope that both sides can seek a solution to this issue through peaceful negotiations. In the joint statement issued by Ceylon's Prime Minister Bandaranaike and me on February 5 of this year, we also jointly called on both sides, for their own interests and for the broader interests of Asian-African solidarity, to further seek a peaceful solution to this issue. Here, we would like to express this wish again. We believe that the two sister countries of India and Pakistan can seek a friendly solution to this issue through peaceful negotiations, and in the situation where the United States controls the United Nations, submitting this issue to the United Nations will only create the danger of foreign intervention.

There are boundary issues left over from colonial rule between many Asian and African countries. These issues are relatively complex and difficult to resolve. However, based on our experience, as long as the relevant parties can be sincere and negotiate in the spirit of the Five Principles and the Bandung Conference resolutions, these issues can also be resolved in a friendly manner. Everyone knows that there is an unresolved border issue between China and Burma. Before we began this visit, our two countries took the opportunity of Burma's Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League Chairman U Nu's visit to China to discuss this issue in a friendly manner. During our visit to Burma, we also discussed this issue with then-Burmese Prime Minister U Ba Swe, Chairman U Nu, and other leaders. The results of these discussions have made us deeply believe that the border issue left over from history between China and Burma can be resolved in a friendly manner. With the resolution of this issue, the friendship between our two countries will certainly be further consolidated and developed. The position taken by the Chinese government on this issue is not only based on safeguarding China's national interests but also on promoting Sino-Burmese friendship and Asian-African solidarity.

The 1955 Bandung Conference was the first time that the Asian and African peoples jointly issued a resounding call to oppose colonialism, maintain and strive for national independence, defend world peace, and promote friendly cooperation. Now, this call has become increasingly powerful. The friendship rebuilt at that historic conference between many Asian and African countries that were once separated and isolated has made significant progress in the nearly two years since then. We have personally experienced that the Bandung spirit has not withered away as its enemies hoped, but is continuing to flourish. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are being accepted by more and more countries. The joint statements and joint communiqués we issued with many Asian countries' leaders during this visit are evidence of this. In these documents, the Bandung resolutions and the Five Principles have been repeatedly reaffirmed. In the joint statement issued by the premiers of China and India in June 1954, it was pointed out that the widespread application of the Five Principles would form a solid foundation for peace and security and would help create and expand peaceful regions, thereby reducing the possibility of war and strengthening the cause of world peace. We are now pleased to see that this hope is increasingly becoming a reality.

The Egyptian incident that occurred shortly before we began this visit most clearly demonstrated the power and role of Asian-African solidarity. In the countries we visited, we could see everywhere people expressing sympathy and support for the Egyptian people. With the support of the broad masses of the Asian and African peoples and all peace-loving forces in the world, the Egyptian people, through their resolute struggle, have repulsed the aggression of the colonialists. They have achieved initial victory in their struggle to defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity and the peace of the Asian-African region. This fact has greatly encouraged us Asian-African peoples. At the same time, we have also gained great enlightenment: although the Asian and African countries are not yet strong in material force, as long as we insist on the solidarity of the Asian-African countries and the solidarity with all peace-loving forces in the world and wage a resolute struggle, there is no colonialist aggression that cannot be repelled.

The facts we saw during our visit to Asia have convinced us that the consistent advocacy of promoting friendly cooperation among Asian and African countries since the founding of the People's Republic of China is completely in line with the national interests of our Asian and African countries and is also in line with the general interests of maintaining peace in Asia, Africa, and the world. We are determined to continue to work, on the strict basis of the Five Principles, to develop and strengthen friendly cooperative relations with the countries we visited this time and other Asian and African countries. Even for today's neighbors with China that do not have normal relations, such as Thailand and the Philippines, Singapore and Malaya, we see no reason why we cannot improve our relations with them. In fact, although we do not yet have formal diplomatic relations with some Asian and African countries, we have already established economic and cultural relations. I would also like to point out, as expressed in the Sino-Soviet Joint Statement, that it is time to put the normalization of relations between China and Japan on the agenda.

We are willing, in accordance with the resolutions of the Bandung Conference, to strengthen as much as possible the equal and mutually beneficial economic and cultural cooperation among Asian and African countries to promote the independent development of our respective national economies and national cultures. Although the cooperation among Asian and African countries in this regard has only just begun and is still on a small scale, it has already produced good results. As our respective construction efforts develop, the scale of our cooperation will continue to expand. Currently, China is providing some economic assistance to certain Asian and African countries within its capacity. Although these assistance measures are extremely small in quantity, they are unconditional, which shows our sincere desire to help these countries develop independently. Our economic cooperation with any country or economic assistance to any country is conducted on the basis of the Five Principles and therefore does not exclude these countries from conducting economic cooperation with any other country or accepting economic assistance from any other country. We welcome all economic cooperation and assistance to Asian and African countries that are unconditional and truly aimed at helping underdeveloped countries achieve independent development.

We are also willing to learn from our friendly countries in Asia and Africa their excellent national cultures and their strengths in construction work. During this visit, we saw with our own eyes that although these Asian countries are generally still relatively backward, each country, whether large or small, has its own advantages and strengths. If we can seriously learn from each other, we believe this will definitely help the development of our Asian and African countries.

Comrades, friends: Through this visit, we have seen more clearly that Asia and Africa are awakening and reviving. The independent and the striving-for-independence Asian and African countries have emerged as a new, powerful peace force on the world stage. The Bandung Conference first proved the existence of this force, and the Egyptian incident even more clearly proved the development of this force. The era in which the Asian and African peoples themselves determine the fate of the Asian and African regions has arrived. This is a major feature of our times. Although the forces of colonialism are still trying to undermine the independence of Asian and African countries, suppress the national independence movements in this region, and sow discord among our friendly unity, this will not save colonialism from death nor stop the advance of the Asian and African peoples. The Asian and African region, which has long been the object of colonialist aggression, must become a family of independent countries living in peace and friendly cooperation.

During our overseas visit, the Middle East has been the focus of international tensions. Following the repulsion of the British-French aggression against Egypt, the U.S. government announced the so-called Eisenhower Doctrine, openly advocating that the United States should fill the so-called vacuum left by British and French colonialists in the Middle East, making the Middle East situation tense again. Therefore, we need to specifically discuss this issue.

The development of the Middle East tension has fully demonstrated the sharpening of contradictions among imperialist countries, especially the sharpening of contradictions between the United States and Britain and France. Last year, Britain and France, taking advantage of the U.S. being in the midst of an election campaign, colluded with Israel to launch a sudden armed attack on Egypt, attempting to overthrow the Nasser government led by Nasser and restore their rule in the Suez Canal region, resisting the U.S. policy of squeezing out British and French colonial interests in the Middle East. However, Britain and France's calculations were completely wrong. The British and French aggression against Egypt encountered the resolute resistance of the Egyptian people and the Arab countries, and the Egyptian government's courageous struggle against aggression did not weaken but further consolidated it.

At the same time, in the struggle to compete for colonial interests in the Middle East, the United States launched a resolute counterattack against Britain and France. In the United Nations, the United States supported the Asian and African bloc's proposal to stop the British and French armed aggression against Egypt and withdraw the invading troops. However, does the United States truly care for the Egyptian people and advocate maintaining Egypt's sovereignty and independence? No. As I pointed out in my response to reporters' questions at the beginning of my overseas visit, the United States' purpose is only to seize and replace the British and French colonial positions in the Middle East. The Eisenhower Doctrine fully confirms this. Now, from the surface, the United States seems to advocate the withdrawal of Israeli troops. However, does the United States truly oppose Israeli aggression and maintain the interests of the Arab countries and the peace of the Middle East? No. The United States' purpose is only to expel British and French control over Israel and, by using the conflict between Israel and the Arab countries, continue to maintain the tension in the Middle East region, so as to invade Egypt's sovereignty under the name of the United Nations and expand its own colonial power in the Middle East region.

The U.S. government's proposal of the Eisenhower Doctrine is again using the pretext of opposing the communist threat. In fact, the so-called threat of the Soviet Union or any other socialist country to the Middle East has no factual basis. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries have consistently advocated respecting the sovereignty and independence of the Middle Eastern countries and advocating that the Middle Eastern peoples themselves decide Middle Eastern affairs. Our visit to the nationalist countries this time further proves that socialist countries and nationalist countries cooperate well on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In fact, the current threat to the Middle Eastern countries is precisely the Eisenhower Doctrine of the United States. It concentrates the expansionist and aggressive tactics of the U.S. government, that is, using anti-communism and anti-Sovietism as a pretext, using the creation of tension as a means, to achieve the purpose of suppressing national independence movements, expelling British and French colonial interests, and expanding its own colonial power. This is the essence of U.S. neo-colonialism.

The U.S. government's policy of constantly creating tension to expand and invade is not only firmly opposed by all peace-loving countries and peoples but also inevitably makes the contradictions among imperialist countries even sharper.

When the international situation becomes tense to a certain extent and when pressure from all sides continues to strengthen, the U.S. government sometimes cannot but agree to some measures to ease the situation. However, the U.S. aggression clique is afraid of the international situation truly easing, because this will make them lose their leadership in the so-called free world, make their military alliance increasingly slack, and the Asian and African peoples will further move towards the path of independent development in an eased international situation. Therefore, every time the international situation truly eases, the U.S. aggression clique cannot wait to create new tensions and strive to obstruct the further easing of the situation. This is the root cause of the U.S. government's pursuit of tension while not overly tense, being forced to ease while not daring to ease for a long time, and constantly swaying between easing and tension.

However, the U.S. government's policy cannot last long. More and more countries no longer believe in the U.S. anti-communist and anti-Soviet slogans, are no longer intimidated by the tensions created by the United States, and no longer want their interests to be constantly harmed by the United States. On the other hand, for the United States, continuing to implement this policy can only make itself increasingly isolated.

The Eisenhower Doctrine, which openly declared the seizure of British and French colonial interests, is a very beneficial lesson for countries participating in the U.S. military alliance. To expand its colonial power, the United States does not hesitate to openly infringe on the interests of its major allies, Britain and France. If the United States can discard major allies like Britain and France, then what so-called allies can the United States not discard? Countries following the United States are constantly facing the danger of being discarded, but at the same time, they cannot help but be controlled by the United States. What they get from the United States is only surplus military supplies and dumped goods, because from the U.S. perspective, as Rockefeller said in his letter to Eisenhower in January 1956, "the fish that have already taken the bait do not need bait anymore." However, these countries themselves have to bear the heavy burden of military expenses, making their national economies increasingly bankrupt. These facts cannot but make the governments of these countries rethink their policies.

If some countries once had certain illusions about the Eisenhower Doctrine, believing that they could separate the military part from the so-called economic aid, then the above-mentioned letter from Rockefeller to Eisenhower provides a beneficial lesson. Rockefeller is precisely the advocate of separating the military alliance from "economic aid." However, as he himself said, this is to "in a later stage... tighten the political price and military demands," to make the countries receiving such "aid" "fall into overly large projects, thus long-term needing U.S. support."

For countries that once hoped the United States would uphold justice and support national independence movements, the Eisenhower Doctrine also provides a beneficial lesson. The purpose of the U.S. government is to control the Middle East region and will not truly support the national independence movements of the Arab countries. People should remember that on the Suez Canal issue, it was the United States that first proposed the so-called collective aggression plan of "international control." In fact, as Rockefeller said in the same letter to Eisenhower, the United States cannot let the "desire for independence" develop into "very strong nationalism," to the extent that not only the old colonial countries cannot control it, but the United States also cannot control it.

Britain and France should also learn the appropriate lessons from the Egyptian incident. The era of colonialism has passed and will not return. The use of force against countries and peoples struggling for and maintaining national independence will not bring them any benefits. Relying on U.S. power will also not maintain their interests but will only facilitate the United States in seizing these interests. The relationship between the metropolis and the colony must be replaced by a new relationship of mutual respect for sovereignty and independence. Such an equal and mutually beneficial relationship can only be established on the basis of peaceful coexistence. The peoples of Britain and France are increasingly dissatisfied with their governments' phenomenon of following the United States and becoming increasingly dependent on the United States. Recently, in these two countries, the call to organize an international "third force" has risen again, which is also not accidental.

With the exposure and failure of the U.S. government's expansionist and aggressive policies, more and more countries are taking the path of peaceful neutrality; it has been proven that this path is in line with the national interests of the relevant countries. Based on the policy of peaceful neutrality, they can maintain their independence without being controlled by the United States, they can reduce their military expenses to the lowest possible level, and they can use their resources for national construction. Under the policy of peaceful neutrality, they do not need to restrict their economic and trade relations with socialist countries on an equal and mutually beneficial basis and can seek economic aid without any conditions from various aspects. Therefore, even in countries that have joined the U.S.-organized military alliance, the trend of moving towards peaceful neutrality has emerged. Even in Japan, which is still under U.S. control, the trend of peaceful neutrality has developed.

Although this is the case, one cannot ignore the existence of the threat of war because imperialist aggressive forces will not voluntarily give up their policies of military expansion. Therefore, all peace-loving countries and peoples must resolutely oppose the war conspiracies of imperialism. If the imperialists, despite the opposition of the world's peoples, dare to launch an aggressive war, then in the face of the united strength of all peace-loving countries and peoples, it can be asserted that imperialism will definitely suffer final defeat. The results of the two world wars have already proven that not only the countries that launched the wars will definitely fail, but the entire imperialist system will also be weakened. In today's era, for any imperialist country, war can no longer be an opportunity to make money. Another world war can only lead to the faster and more thorough failure of imperialism.

Socialist countries have consistently advocated that countries with different social systems should coexist peacefully, the peaceful neutrality policy of nationalist countries should be respected, and the national independence aspirations of colonial peoples should be realized. The Chinese government fully supports the Soviet Union's proposals on disarmament on November 17, 1956, and on the Middle East issue on February 11, 1957. We are pleased to see that these proposals have not only gained the unanimous support of socialist countries but also the sympathy of India and many other nationalist countries. We are particularly pleased to see that the recent summit of the four countries of Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan reaffirmed the four countries' adherence to the policy of national independence and neutrality, advocating that the defense of the Arab world should be outside the scope of foreign treaties. This is in line with the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries by major powers and is in line with the interests of world peace.

During our visit, many countries expressed concern about Sino-American relations and kindly hoped to promote the improvement of Sino-American relations. The Chinese people are willing to be friendly with the American people, but the long-term failure to improve Sino-American relations is not our fault. It is the U.S. government that uses the international disputes between China and the United States as a means to create tension in the Far East, obstructing the improvement of Sino-American relations.

To improve Sino-American relations, the Chinese side has made a series of efforts. As early as the Bandung Conference, we proposed resolving the dispute between China and the United States in the Taiwan region through peaceful negotiations and easing and eliminating the tension in the Taiwan region. In the Geneva talks between the Chinese and American ambassadors, we also proposed removing the current obstacles to trade between the two countries, to the exchange of people between the two countries, and to cultural exchanges. In the face of the long-term lack of progress in the ambassadorial-level talks between China and the United States, we also proposed holding a foreign ministerial-level meeting between China and the United States to resolve the outstanding issues between the two countries. However, all these efforts by the Chinese side have not received the appropriate response from the United States.

On the contrary, the U.S. government insists on a policy of hostility towards the Chinese people. After the Korean War ceasefire, the United States broke the agreement on the prisoner issue and sent a large number of captured Chinese people to Taiwan. The United States not only refuses to recognize the People's Republic of China but also obstructs other countries from establishing friendly relations with China. The United States continues to exclude China from international affairs and continues to obstruct the restoration of China's legitimate position in the United Nations. The United States continues to impose an embargo on China and also continues to obstruct other countries from developing equal and mutually beneficial trade with China. What is even more serious is that the United States not only refuses to engage in serious negotiations on the issue of tension in the Taiwan region but also intensifies its military control over Taiwan, expands its military bases in Taiwan, and plans to deploy missiles in Taiwan, deliberately escalating the tension in the Taiwan region. Not only that, but the United States also attempts to use Sino-American talks to make China acknowledge the status quo of U.S. occupation of Taiwan, creating the so-called "two Chinas" situation. We are willing to resolve international disputes between China and the United States through peaceful negotiations, but our determination to defend national sovereignty and liberate Taiwan is unshakable, and the U.S. government's conspiracy to create "two Chinas" will never succeed.

Taiwan is Chinese territory. The residents of Taiwan, including all Nationalist military and political personnel, are Chinese. The liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair and a problem that the Chinese people can solve themselves. Since we called for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, more and more Nationalist military and political personnel in Taiwan have been willing to promote peaceful liberation, and the possibility of peaceful liberation of Taiwan has also increased. However, the U.S. government has shown extreme fear of this situation and is not afraid to use all means to sabotage it. Recently, the United States has instigated a group of self-proclaimed "free China" elements and so-called "Taiwan independence" elements to carry out activities to overthrow the Taiwan authorities, attempting to turn Taiwan into a U.S. territory like Honolulu. In fact, the U.S. government's tactics can only make all patriotic Chinese people see more clearly the true face of the U.S. government's attempt to enslave China. Today, the United States can launch a movement to overthrow the Taiwan authorities, and tomorrow, the United States can abandon those self-proclaimed "free China" and "Taiwan independence" elements. Seeking fame and fortune by betraying the country will not only bring no glory but will also be infamous forever. All Chinese with blood and courage should unite in the spirit of loving the country as one family, oppose external forces, and smash the conspiracies of American imperialism.

The U.S. government's hostile policy towards the Chinese people cannot affect the existence and development of China. The People's Republic of China has not only stood firmly in the world but will also continue to develop and grow stronger along the socialist road. The U.S. government's attempt to turn Taiwan into a U.S. territory will not only be firmly opposed by all patriotic Chinese people but will also be unacceptable to all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world. The trend of Taiwan returning to the motherland's embrace is irresistible. No force in the world can permanently separate the Chinese people from the Chinese people.

Comrades, friends: The general trend of the world is towards easing and progress. The forces of peace are constantly growing, and the forces of war are becoming increasingly isolated. As long as the socialist countries, nationalist countries, and all peace-loving countries and peoples unite and persist in the struggle, lasting world peace can be achieved. The Chinese people will take on their due responsibilities in this great struggle and continue to make unremitting efforts for the cause of world peace and human progress.

    关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告
    ——1957年3月5日在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第三次全体会议上	周恩来同志们，朋友们：
    中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第三次全体会议，现在开幕了。
    从我们上次的全体会议到现在的一年多时间里，随着我国社会主义事业的进一步发展，我国的人民民主统一战线也更加巩固、更加扩大了。我们这次会议也反映了这个事实。全国委员会原有六百六十四位委员，病故十一位，新增补的委员有七十六位。出席这次会议的委员，除了请假的一百零八位以外，共计六百二十一人，比历次的会议都要多。
    在我们这次会议开幕以前，全国委员会的委员曾经被邀请参加了扩大的最高国务会议，毛泽东主席在会议上作了关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾问题的重要讲话。在我们这次会议的预备会议上，我们又听取了李富春副总理关于第二个五年计划建议的若干问题的说明。大家对于毛主席的讲话和李富春副总理所作的说明，都进行了分组讨论。在我们这次会议上，将有关于增产节约、农业问题、政法工作、教育工作等专题发言。这些都是目前我们国家工作中的一些迫切的、同时也是大家关心的重要问题。我们希望，这次会议将能够继续发扬人民政协的民主传统，对我们国家工作的各个重要的方面，充分而坦率地进行讨论和交换意见，并且提出积极而切实的建议。
    最近，我和贺龙副总理受我国政府的委托，到亚洲和欧洲的十一个国家进行了友好访问。我现在借这次会议的机会，向政协全国委员会和全国人民报告我们访问的结果，同时也谈一谈目前的国际形势和我国的外交政策。	（一）
    中国政府一向重视各国之间的相互友好访问，特别是各国领导人员之间的接触对于和缓国际紧张局势和加强各国的相互了解和信任所起的重要作用。不久以前，中国政府十分高兴地接受了亚洲和欧洲十一国政府的邀请，委派我和贺龙副总理到越南民主共和国、柬埔寨王国、印度共和国、缅甸联邦、巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟、波兰人民共和国、匈牙利人民共和国、阿富汗王国、尼泊尔王国和锡兰十一国，进行友好访问。在访问苏联、波兰和匈牙利的期间，参加中国政府代表团的还有外交部王稼祥副部长和我国在各驻在国的大使。这次访问的时间，从1956年11月18日起，到1957年2月5日止，中间回国一次，前后将近八十天，全部旅行的路程大约有五万四千多公里。
    在所有十一个国家，各国人民对我们的热情而盛大的欢迎，各国政府和领导人员对我们的隆重而亲切的接待，都给我们留下了深刻而难忘的印象。许多国家的领导人亲自陪同我们到他们国内各地去访问和参观。在我们访问过的许多地方，不论是白天还是晚上，都有成千上万的人，不顾酷热或者严寒，出来向我们欢呼，用富有色采的民族仪式欢迎我们，悬挂着或者手挥着中国和他们本国的国旗欢迎我们，并且给我们各种崇高的荣誉。
    我们在十一个国家所受到的这种欢迎和接待，绝不是仅仅给予我们个人的。这一切，实际上都表现了这些国家的人民对解放了的中国的友谊，对胜利了的中国人民的热爱。我们在这些国家所得到的一切荣誉，都应该归于我们伟大的祖国，归于我们伟大的人民。现在，当我向全国人民报告访问结果的时候，我首先要向六万万中国人民转达所有十一个国家的人民的深厚友情，并且代表中国政府和中国人民再一次向这些国家的政府和人民表示最诚挚的谢意。
    我们是抱着寻求友谊、寻求和平和寻求知识的目的去访问这些国家的。我们可以说，这些目的已经实现了。我们希望，这次访问将有助于亚洲各国的团结，更好地为巩固各国民族独立和反对殖民主义而斗争；将有助于社会主义各国的团结，更好地为社会主义事业而努力；将有助于世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民的团结，更好地为保卫世界和平而奋斗。
    我们同十一个国家的领导人员进行了亲切、诚挚和友好的会谈，并且同十个国家的政府领导人发表了联合公报或者联合声明。我们在访问苏联的期间，还同当时在苏联进行访问的德意志民主共和国政府代表团举行了会谈，并且发表了联合公报。通过这些接触和会谈，我们更加体会到各国领导人员保持经常联系的重要性。我们参观了十一个国家人民的生活和工作的许多方面，并且在同这些国家的政治家和其他各界人士的接触中，结识了许多朋友。在访问期间，我们有多次机会同各国新闻界的人士接触，并且通过他们，向各国人民解释了中国政府在许多重大国际问题上的立场，表达了中国人民要求同各国人民和平友好的愿望。
    通过在访问中的这一系列活动，我们不仅体会了所有十一国的人民对中国人民的友好，而且还体会到他们要同世界各国人民友好的愿望。我们也体会了所有这些国家的人民要求进行和平建设、维护世界和平的意志。我们还看到了所有这些国家的人民在和平建设中所作的努力和所取得的成就，并且发现这些国家不论在他们优秀的民族文化方面或者在目前的建设成就方面，都有许多值得我们学习的地方。当然，在我们访问每一个国家的短短的时间里，进行深入的学习是不可能的。但是，我们相信，这次访问已经为我们今后继续向这些国家学习创造了良好的条件。
    应该指出，我们出国访问，正是在帝国主义侵略势力对社会主义阵营和反殖民主义的民族独立运动发动了进攻、竭力制造新的紧张局势的时候，同时也是在帝国主义国家之间的矛盾更加尖锐化的时候。但是，也就是在这个时候，帝国主义侵略势力在匈牙利的颠复活动和对埃及的武装进攻，都遭到了严重的失败。我们在占世界人口将近三分之一的四个社会主义国家和七个亚洲民族主义国家看到，人民强烈地反对战争，反对殖民主义，反对颠复活动，帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策已经越来越不得人心，而和平和进步的力量却日益壮大和巩固。尽管这些国家跟我们的国家一样，过去遇到过、将来也还难免会遇到一些这样那样的困难和挫折，但是，这些是前进中的困难和挫折。冲破这些困难和挫折的社会主义力量和民族独立力量，将会更加强大起来；而帝国主义力量必然会继续削弱下去，他们彼此之间的利害冲突也必然会更加尖锐起来。历史的进程是扭转不了的。世界总的趋势是走向和缓、走向进步的。	（二）
    现在，我先谈谈我们对四个社会主义国家的访问。
    从1956年11月18日到11月22日，我们在越南民主共和国的首都河内进行了四天的访问。越南民主共和国是处在同帝国主义斗争最前线的一个兄弟国家。越南仍然处于分裂的现状不能不为越南人民的改革和建设工作带来困难。但是，从战斗中成长的越南人民是从来不向困难低头的。我们在访问中看到，两年半来越南人民在越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席的领导下，在医治战争创伤、建设越南北方的工作中，取得了很大的成就。土地改革的工作已经取得了基本上的胜利，工作中的偏差正在加以纠正。经济恢复的工作将要在今年基本上完成。同时，新的、社会主义的建设，也已经开始。尽管由于美国的破坏和南方当局的反对，越南人民还没有完成和平统一祖国的事业，但是，越南民主共和国在建设中所取得的成就，正在向从北到南的越南人民指出他们祖国的独立发展的道路。最使我们感到钦佩的，是胡志明主席、越南劳动党和越南人民艰苦奋斗、勤劳朴素的作风，这是特别值得我们学习的。
    在河内，我们参观了工厂、学校和少年儿童俱乐部，欣赏了越南的民族艺术。我们还参观了越南人民纪念他们的民族女英雄征侧和征贰的二征王庙。这两位女英雄曾经在一千九百多年以前抗击过中国封建王朝对越南的侵略。我们曾经向这两位越南民族英雄的塑像献花致敬。在我们同越南民主共和国胡志明主席、范文同总理和其他领导人员的会晤中，在我们同越南各界人士的接触中，我们无时无刻不体会到越南人民对中国人民亲如手足的同志情谊。
    我们从1957年1月7日到1月10日，从1月17日到1月19日，前后在苏联访问了六天。我们拜会了伏罗希洛夫主席，同部长会议主席布尔加宁、苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫和苏联其他领导人员进行了亲切的会谈，并且发表了关于目前国际问题的全面的联合声明。
    在访问苏联的期间，最使我们感动的，是苏联人民对中国人民的无限深厚的同志友谊。关于我们这次同苏联人民的聚会，赫鲁晓夫同志说得最好。他说，我们有权利把这次聚会“叫做春天的节日，叫做我们兄弟人民之间永恒的、牢不可破的友谊加强和繁荣的节日”。的确，尽管我们在访问苏联的期间，自然的气候是在零度以下，但是，我们从苏联人民那里得到的社会主义大家庭的温暖，使我们感到像在春天一样。通过这次访问，我们同苏联人民一起，再一次向全世界显示了中苏两国人民之间的亲密友谊和巩固团结，没有任何力量可以把我们两国人民分开。
    我们在苏联参观了企业、农庄、学校和武装部队。我们亲眼看到，苏联的共产主义建设事业又有了突飞猛进的发展。苏联的国力正在变得更加强大，苏联的科学技术正在走向新的高峰。在我们同苏联领导人员和各界人士的接触中，我们体会到苏联对自己工作中的错误和缺点所进行的批评，对于苏联生活和工作的各个方面都起了推动的作用。我们在离开苏联以前，还有机会在乌兹别克苏维埃社会主义共和国的首都塔什干作了短时间的逗留。这个共和国由于在棉花种植方面作出了巨大贡献，最近曾经荣获列宁勋章。在塔什干，我们曾经参观了一个集体农庄，并且具体地了解了这个共和国在经济和文化方面全面发展和繁荣的情况。这个共和国的成就生动地证明了社会主义制度的优越性和苏联共产党、苏联政府所执行的正确的民族政策的伟大成功。
    从1957年1月11日到1月16日，我们访问了波兰人民共和国。在华沙，我们拜会了波兰国务委员会主席萨瓦茨基，同部长会议主席西伦凯维兹、统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡和其他领导人员进行了亲切的会谈，并且参观了工厂。此外，我们还到了波兰的古都克拉科夫、钢铁制造业中心诺瓦胡塔、波兰西部的工业基地弗罗茨瓦夫和波兰的第二大城市著名的工人运动中心罗兹。我们亲眼看到，在不到十二年的时间内，波兰人民在波兰统一工人党和波兰政府的领导下，已经打下了社会主义的基础。这个基本的成就是无论如何也不应该低估的。
    尽管过去在波兰的政治和经济的生活中发生过一些错误和偏差，但是，我们高兴地看到，波兰统一工人党在以哥穆尔卡同志为首的中央委员会的领导下，正在纠正过去领导所犯的教条主义的错误，同时也在反对修正主义的错误。他们正在加强国内和党内的团结，密切党同人民的联系，并且努力增进波兰同其他社会主义国家、首先是同苏联的关系。有着光荣的斗争历史的波兰劳动人民，正在以极大的热情为维护和发展波兰的社会主义事业而努力。
    波兰人民的国际主义精神给了我们以极其深刻的印象。我们现在还能够清楚地回忆起在波兰各地多次看到的动人场面。尽管下着大雪，人们万人空巷地出来欢迎我们。他们从四面八方围拢上来，争着向我们献花，同我们握手。他们唱着著名的民歌“让他在我们中间活一百年”，向我们表示欢迎。这种景象是我们永远也不能忘记的。
    波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹已经接受了我们的邀请，将在今年4月间来中国访问。
    我们访问了波兰以后，从1月16日到1月17日在匈牙利人民共和国的首都布达佩斯进行了一天的访问。我们拜会了道比主席，同卡达尔总理和其他领导人员进行了亲切的会谈。在这以前，匈牙利、中国、苏联的共产党和工人党及政府的代表曾经在1月10日在莫斯科进行过会谈，并且发表了三国会谈的公报。
    我们访问布达佩斯，是在匈牙利人民在苏联军队的帮助之下镇压了反革命分子的武装暴乱以后不久。但是，我们发现，匈牙利人民在社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的领导下，正在迅速地恢复着社会秩序和经济生活。我们看到，绝大部分的工厂已经复工，市内的交通已经恢复，商店照常营业，人民生活正在恢复正常。
    我们在布达佩斯参加了自从去年十月事件以来第一次举行的、由匈牙利各地的一千多名积极分子参加的大会，并且在会上讲了话。这是一次令人兴奋的集会。在会上讲话的，还有卡达尔总理、工人、农业生产合作社社员和小学教员。从他们的讲话中可以看出，社会主义工人党、工农革命政府和以匈牙利工人阶级为首的一切健康的民主力量，丝毫也没有低估目前还摆在他们面前的许多艰巨复杂的任务。他们都很正确地着重指出，在目前的任务中，最重要的是实行有效的无产阶级专政，肃清反革命分子；加强思想教育，帮助人民分清敌我和是非，加强党和政府同广大群众的联系；进一步恢复和增加生产，克服暂时性的经济困难。
    尽管我们在布达佩斯只停留了一天，但是，我们已经得到了一个不可磨灭的印象，那就是，匈牙利人民正在坚决地纠正过去领导的一切错误，决心用全付力量保卫社会主义建设的成果，毫不动摇地维护社会主义阵营的团结。我们相信，整个社会主义阵营都会从匈牙利事件中吸取深刻的教训，避免重犯匈牙利过去领导所犯的错误。同时，匈牙利人民不被严重的挫折所压倒而是坚强地站起来了，这种精神是值得我们钦佩的。
    为了推进我们共同的社会主义事业，社会主义各国需要努力互相学习，取长补短。中国在许多方面还很落后，经验也很不够，因此更有必要继续向其他社会主义国家学习，首先是向最先进的社会主义国家苏联学习。我们这次访问社会主义国家的主要目的之一，也正是向这些国家学习先进经验。毛主席警告我们，决不应该由于革命的胜利和在建设上有了一些成绩而自高自大。毛主席还提醒我们，虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后。我们应该永远记住这个真理。
    我们对于四个社会主义国家的访问，使我们更加深信社会主义制度的优越性。我们社会主义各国的经济都在日益高涨。我们社会主义各国的友好互助关系正在得到进一步的改进和加强。我们社会主义国家都坚持不同社会制度的国家和平共处的原则。我们相信，在日益壮大和团结一致的社会主义阵营面前，帝国主义侵略集团的一切破坏阴谋都是注定要失败的。
    在社会主义制度下，劳动人民真正掌握了自己的命运，消灭了人剥削人的现象，因此，社会主义制度能够充分地发挥人民的积极性和创造性，大大地推进生产力的发展。这是我们常说的道理，而实际情况也确实是如此。就我们访问过的四个社会主义国家来说，每一国的社会生产力都比过去有了很大的发展。如果拿1956年的工业生产总值来同过去比较，那么，苏联已经达到十月革命以前1913年水平的三十倍，波兰已经达到二次大战以前水平的五倍以上，匈牙利已经达到战前水平的三倍以上，越南民主共和国已经达到1955年水平的四倍以上。在其他的社会主义国家，也有同样的情况。社会主义制度不仅保证生产力的不断增长，而且还保证这种增长为满足整个社会不断提高的需要而服务。这同资本主义制度下生产力发展的极不稳定和生产只是为社会上极少数的人取得最大限度利润的情况，形成鲜明的对比。这一切正表明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。
    当然，社会主义制度的优越性决不意味着我们在工作中没有困难，也不能保证我们在工作中不犯错误。社会主义制度是一种新的社会制度。即使是在社会主义制度之下，生产关系和生产力之间，上层建筑和经济基础之间，也仍然存在着一定的矛盾，需要及时地加以调整。而且，社会主义国家的历史还短，有的只有几年或者十几年，最多也不超出四十年。因此，要在工作中不遇到困难和不犯错误是不可能的。过去有过困难和犯过错误，今后也还会不断遇到困难，也还会犯错误。但是，从过去整个时期来看，在社会主义国家，成绩总是基本的。随着经验的积累和实践的考验，社会主义国家将能够更好地调整人民内部的矛盾，使这种矛盾不致转化为对抗性的矛盾，使我们能够更好地克服工作中的困难，减少工作中的错误。只有工人阶级的政党和工人阶级领导的国家，才能够自觉地认识自己工作中的错误，并且勇敢地揭发和纠正这些错误，使伟大的社会主义事业更加健全地向前发展。这一切，正是社会主义制度比任何旧的社会制度优越得不可比拟的地方。
    世界上一切反动势力看到我们社会主义国家有了困难和错误，就幸灾乐祸，就妄想利用这些困难和错误来进行破坏活动。但是，所有这一切都将是徒劳的。通过不断地克服困难和纠正错误，我们的社会主义事业不仅不会削弱，而且一定会更加巩固和兴盛。
    社会主义各国是由共同的共产主义的理想和目标联系起来的，因此，他们之间的关系是以无产阶级的国际主义原则为基础的。社会主义各国又是独立的主权国家，因此，他们之间的关系又是以马克思列宁主义关于民族平等的原则为基础的。社会主义各国之间没有根本的矛盾和利害冲突。同帝国主义国家之间互相排挤、互相并吞的关系相反，社会主义各国的团结互助关系是一种完全新型的国际关系。苏联不仅是第一个胜利的社会主义国家，而且是国力最强大和经验最丰富的社会主义国家。它对于其他社会主义国家一直给予最重大的援助。因此，苏联很自然地成为社会主义各国团结的中心。而中国和苏联的友好团结又是社会主义国家伟大团结的一个极其重要的部分。我们常说，社会主义国家之间的亲密团结和友好互助是社会主义事业的最可靠的保证，是巩固世界和平的强大力量。通过这次访问，我们对于这一点有了更深刻的体会。
    在社会主义各国的关系中，团结和互助一向是主要的和基本的方面。但是，正由于这种关系是一种完全新型的关系，还缺乏充分的经验，因此，在社会主义各国的相互关系中还不能说一切都是完满的、正常的。在社会主义国家的相互关系中所表现的大国主义倾向或者狭隘民族主义倾向，都曾经造成社会主义国家之间的某些隔阂和误解，现在，这些缺点和错误正在克服当中。苏联政府在1956年10月30日发表了宣言，表示要根据完全平等、尊重领土完整、国家独立和主权、互不干涉内政等项原则，发展和进一步加强同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作。这对于改正社会主义国家相互关系方面的错误，对于增强社会主义国家之间的团结，具有重大的意义。中国政府在1956年11月1日发表了支持苏联政府这个宣言的声明。在我们这次对社会主义国家的访问中，我们又表达了对于进一步加强社会主义各国团结的深切愿望。我们这种愿望在我们访问过的每一个社会主义国家中都得到了共鸣。
    最近一个时期以来，除了我们对社会主义国家的访问以外，其他许多社会主义国家也先后进行了双边的或者多边的会谈，并且发表了与这有关的联合声明和公报。这些都表明，社会主义各国正在共同努力改进相互关系，加强团结。
    社会主义各国都以马克思列宁主义为共同的指导思想，这是我们在原则问题上一致的基础。但是，这并不是说，我们社会主义各国在原则一致的情况下，在所有的时候，对所有的问题，都有一致的看法。在某些问题上的不同意见，对于我们各国原则一致的主要方面说来，毕竟处于次要的地位。而且，这种不同意见是可以在马克思列宁主义的共同基础上，通过同志式的讨论和协商，逐步地求得一致的。即使暂时还不能求得一致，只要团结关系受到珍重，保留这种不同意见也是正常的。
    帝国主义国家惯于用他们自己的相互关系，衡量社会主义各国之间的关系。他们企图利用社会主义国家在相互关系方面的问题和社会主义国家之间的某些不同意见，挑拨和破坏社会主义各国的团结，并且加紧进行对社会主义国家的颠复活动。他们在匈牙利所策动的反革命暴乱，最彰明昭著地暴露了他们这种从匈牙利打开缺口以便各个击破社会主义国家的罪恶企图。但是，社会主义国家之间的团结是牢不可破的。苏联出兵援助匈牙利人民镇压反革命暴乱和社会主义阵营各国对以卡达尔同志为首的匈牙利工农革命政府的支持和援助，充分地证明了社会主义国家是忠实于无产阶级国际主义原则的。帝国主义国家破坏社会主义国家的罪恶企图过去已经遭到可耻的失败，今后还将继续遭到可耻的失败。
    社会主义国家一向主张世界上不同社会制度的国家和平共处，而不用武力解决国际争端。我们知道，既然存在着不同的社会制度，和平共处就意味着这些不同制度的国家之间在政治、经济和文化各方面的和平竞赛。我们深信社会主义制度的优越性，我们敢于进行这种和平竞赛。
    我们社会主义国家根本不会向外扩张，根本不会对其他国家进行侵略。我们认为革命是不能输出的，我们主张由各国人民选择自己的政治制度。我们愿意同帝国主义国家互相保证互不侵犯，和平共处。我们深信，这种主张不仅在目前国际关系中指出了一条符合于全世界人民利益的道路，而且对帝国主义国家来说，也是最现实的。但是，如果帝国主义侵略集团不愿意走这条道路，竟敢对社会主义国家进行侵犯，那么，正如1957年1月18日的中苏联合声明所指出的，“中国和苏联同一切社会主义国家都具有兄弟般的友谊和相互协助的义务，帝国主义侵略集团企图破坏社会主义国家的任何挑衅行为，都将受到最坚决的回击。”
    同志们，朋友们：我们社会主义国家代表着世界上的新生力量，象征着人类的光明前途。正义和进步人类的同情都在我们方面，我们的事业是一定要胜利的。但是，我们也清楚地知道，尽管我们愿意同一切国家和平共处，帝国主义仍在用战争来威胁我们。我们必须经常保持警惕，在进一步发展我们经济的同时，继续加强我们的国防力量。不断壮大的、团结一致的以苏联为首的社会主义阵营是不可战胜的。	（三）
    现在，我来谈谈我们对亚洲七个民族主义国家的访问。
    在离开越南民主共和国以后，我们就在1956年11月22日到了柬埔寨王国。我们是为了回报柬埔寨西哈努克亲王在1956年2月到中国的访问，作为柬埔寨国王和王后的客人去的。在那里，我们受到了隆重和盛大的接待。这种接待，以及在整个访问期间，国王、王后和西哈努克亲王对我们的亲切关怀，柬埔寨人民向我们表示的巨大热情，使我们深为感动。
    应该承认，我们原来对这个邻国的了解是很不充分的，通过五天的访问，正如在柬埔寨桑云首相和我所发表的联合声明中所说的那样，我们得到了进一步互相认识和互相了解的机会。我们看到，自古以来，柬埔寨人民就同中国人民存在着骨肉般的关系。现在，在五百万柬埔寨居民中就有三十多万是中国的侨民。我们十分高兴，殖民主义统治在我们中间造成的隔阂已经随着我们各自的独立而消除了，我们这两个亲戚的国家已经建立了过去从来没有过的友好关系。
    我们到了金边、磅湛、暹粒、磅清扬，看到柬埔寨是一个风景优美、资源丰富的国家。柬埔寨人民在取得独立以后正在开始对这种丰富的资源进行开发。暹粒附近有一千年左右历史的吴哥古宫是一个世界艺术的杰作，它使人深深钦佩柬埔寨人民的创造才能。
    柬埔寨王国政府执行着西哈努克亲王所制定的和平中立的独立政策。我们相信在维护和平的事业中，中柬两国的友谊将不断取得发展。
    在从去年11月28日到12月10日的十二天内，我们访问了印度共和国。这是我们第二次到我们这个伟大的邻邦。第一次是在1954年6月，当时，因为日内瓦会议还在进行，我们只能在德里作了仅仅三天的停留，因而没有机会来了解印度人民各方面的生活。在这一次的访问中，由于普拉沙德总统、尼赫鲁总理的关怀和妥善安排，我们参观了德里、浦那、孟买、班加罗尔、马德拉斯、阿散索尔、奇塔兰詹、辛德利和加尔各答这些可以说是遍及这个次大陆的南北东西的大城市和工业中心。我们看到了印度人民在长远的历史中所创造的优美而丰富的文化，同时我们也看到了印度人民在建设现代国家方面，在工业、科学和技术方面的不少成就。中国人民在许多方面可以从我们的印度朋友那里得到教益。
    印度人民对我们的热情欢迎是难以用言语形容的。也许我可以举出几个数字来作为一种简单的说明：在德里，有上百万的人到市民大会上来欢迎我们；在加尔各答，参加市民大会的有一百多万人；在孟买、马德拉斯和其他城市的街道上，在印度东北部工业区从阿散索尔到奇塔兰詹到辛德利的一百五十公里的公路上，都连绵不断地站满了前来欢迎我们的密密层层的人群。不论到那里，我们都听到“印地秦尼巴依巴依”（印中两国人民是兄弟）的亲切的欢呼声。
    当我们在亚洲各国访问的整个期间，我们曾有四次路过印度，两次经过德里，两次经过加尔各答，每一次都受到了印度政府和人民的盛情接待，这种情谊使我们深为感激。
    我们第一次路过德里的时候正是新年。尼赫鲁总理陪同我们去参观了印度最大的巴克拉—南加尔水电站工程。这是目前世界上最高的水闸之一，工程的规模十分宏伟。当我们在今年1月底路过加尔各答的时候，我们又曾到了加尔各答附近的和平村，参观了伟大的印度文学家泰戈尔所创办的国际大学。
    在我们三次到德里的时候，每一次都同尼赫鲁总理进行了会谈，对双方都有兴趣的许多问题广泛地交换了意见，并且对许多问题取得了一致的看法。我们认为，这种友好亲切的会谈是十分有益的。当然，中国和印度之间并不是，也不可能是，在一切问题上都抱有同样的见解，但是，正如尼赫鲁总理在我们访问印度期间所说过的那样：
  “我们在某些问题上的不同意是一种友好的不同意，并不妨碍我们的友好合作”。这种会谈加深了我们彼此的相互了解。这将能更加有利于我们两国在维护世界和平和促进国际合作的共同事业中，从各自不同的地位发挥各自的作用。我们两国在这方面久已存在的友好合作关系，一定能够在今后得到进一步的加强。
    我们接着就访问了缅甸联邦，这也是我们的第二次访问。在从去年12月10日到12月20日的十天中，我们到了仰光、曼德勒、眉谬、八莫、密支那、喜河、阳瑞、东枝和腊戍等缅甸的主要城市，看到了我们这个近邻的秀丽山川和各族人民丰富多彩的艺术，并且广泛地结识了缅甸各方面的人士，其中包括同中国西南各少数民族有亲戚关系的缅甸各少数民族的领袖们。缅甸人民对中国人民有着深厚的友谊，他们到处给我们以热情的欢迎，并且叫我们作“胞波”，意思就是同胞兄弟。在我们访问缅甸期间，中缅两国总理和副总理曾经共同出席了在中国云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州首府芒市举行的中缅两国边境人民联欢大会，这次大会生动地表现了我们两国人民在悠久的历史中结成的亲如手足的感情。
    我们在访问期间曾经拜会了巴宇总统，并且同当时的缅甸联邦总理吴巴瑞和反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努以及其他领导人在和谐的空气中举行了会谈，就对两国利益有关的问题和某些具有国际重要性的迫切问题广泛地交换了意见，这些问题中也包括中缅边界的问题。双方在讨论中进一步澄清了彼此的观点，我们相信，中缅边界的问题已经更加接近解决了。
    随后，我们就在去年12月20日到了巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国。巴基斯坦苏拉瓦底总理刚刚在去年10月间访问过中国，我们的这次访问是对他的访问的回报。这是一个年青的共和国，然而有着悠久的历史和丰富优美的文化。巴基斯坦人民同中国人民的友好往来可以追溯到十分遥远的过去。
    在到去年12月30日为止的十天中，我们到了西巴基斯坦，访问了卡拉奇、海德拉巴、白沙瓦、拉合尔这样一些历史上的名城，我们也到了东巴基斯坦，访问了达卡和锡特拉基河上富庶的纳拉扬甘吉工业区。不论在西巴基斯坦或者东巴基斯坦，我们都受到了当地政府和人民的十分热情的欢迎。我还记得，我们从拉合尔到达卡，因为飞机延迟了起飞的时间，到达的时候已经是晚上六点半钟了。但是在达卡机场上和通到城里的公路上仍然有十多万从东巴基斯坦各地远道而来的人民在黄昏里欢迎我们。他们为了要和我们会见，曾经等候了七、八个钟头。这种动人的情景，将永远留在我们的记忆里。
    我们在巴基斯坦的时候，也曾经同米尔扎总统、苏拉瓦底总理和其他领导人进行了会谈。通过这些坦率的会谈，我们两国对于彼此的许多意见得到了更好的了解。大家都知道，我们在某些问题上的看法是不同的。例如，巴基斯坦参加了马尼拉条约和巴格达条约，而我们是反对这些条约的。但是，我们仍然在促进世界和平和进一步发展中国和巴基斯坦之间现存的友好关系的问题上，表示了共同的愿望。
    阿富汗王国是我们在离开欧洲以后首先访问的国家。我们在今年1月19日到那里，在那里停留了五天。虽然我们是初次到这个帕米尔高原西南的邻国，但是这个国家对我们却并不生疏。中国古代和西亚、南亚以至欧洲各国的贸易和文化的往来大多要经过阿富汗。在这个长期是古代东西交通的中心的地方，我们现在还可以看到许多标志着中阿友谊的文物。
    我们在阿富汗受到了阿富汗国王、达乌德首相和王国政府其他领导人的亲切接待。当我们在阿富汗访问的时候，我们曾参观了喀布尔和坎大哈的许多历史遗迹，阿富汗人民为了保卫自己的民族独立而坚决反击并且战胜了帝国主义侵略的英勇历史给我们留下了特别深刻的印象。我们也曾经参观了喀布尔附近的沙罗比水电站工程和坎大哈附近的赫尔曼德河谷水利工程。阿富汗人民今天在艰难的条件下努力建设自己的祖国的坚毅的决心，引起了我们极大的敬意。我们衷心地祝贺他们的努力得到成功。
    我们在喀布尔的时候曾经同达乌德首相和阿富汗王国政府的其他领导人进行了友好的会谈。达乌德首相已经接受了我们的邀请，我们欢迎他早日到中国来访问。
    从今年1月25日到29日，我们到尼泊尔王国进行了访问。中国人民都知道尼泊尔是一个古老的国家，在两千五百年以前，佛教就是在这里发源的。虽然中国和尼泊尔之间横亘着世界上最高的喜马拉雅山，它也没有能够阻止我们两国人民从遥远的古代起就开始友好的来往。在我们到尼泊尔的三个月以前，尼泊尔阿查里雅首相曾经访问过中国。我们的这种来往，标志着中国和尼泊尔的古老的友谊已经有了新的发展。
    我们在尼泊尔到了被称为光荣之城的尼泊尔首都——加德满都，也到了被称为美丽之城的拉利特普尔和被称为虔信之城的巴克塔普尔。这是一个土地肥沃、风景美丽的国家。我们相信，尼泊尔人民现在正在从事的建设事业是有美好的前途的。
    尼泊尔人民给了我们兄弟般的热烈欢迎。尼泊尔国王和王后给了我们亲切的接待。尼泊尔阿查里雅首相和我们进行了友好而诚挚的会谈。我们重申了我们两国对促进中尼友谊、亚非团结和世界和平事业的愿望。
    我们这次访问中最后到的是锡兰。这也是一个和中国有悠久联系的国家。近几年来，我们之间以大米换橡胶的贸易对我们两国的经济都曾经起了十分有利的影响，因而在我们两国人民之间留下了很深刻的印象。我们同古?狄莱克总督，班达拉奈克总理和锡兰政府其他领导人还是第一次会面，然而大家却感到像老朋友一样。锡兰人民给了我们最热烈的欢迎。我们在这个岛上进行的广泛的旅行中，到处都遇到了成千上万的人群向我们欢呼友好。
    除了首都科伦坡以外，我们访问了锡兰的古都康提和波隆纳鲁瓦。我们看到这个富饶美丽的岛国是名副其实的印度洋上的一颗珍珠。锡兰人民在古代就有了令人钦佩的卓越成就；现在，在摆脱了四百多年的殖民统治以后，又正在以很大的热情创造自己的新的生活。他们是值得我们钦佩的朋友。
    我们满意地看到，锡兰政府和人民执行着维护和平的独立政策。锡兰总理班达拉奈克和我们举行的会谈取得了十分满意的结果。我们主张促进五项原则的实施，主张加强亚非国家的团结，主张不同制度的国家和平共处，主张国际争端应该和平解决，支持裁军，主张禁止核子武器，反对成立敌对性的军事集团，反对所谓“真空”的理论，反对强权政治。我们相信，这些主张的实现，将能有助于世界和平的加强。
    我们感到特别欣慰的是，中国和锡兰现在已经建立了正式的外交关系。班达拉奈克总理也已经答应今年要到中国来访问，我们期待在北京再一次同他欢聚。
    在叙述了我们在亚洲七个民族主义国家的访问的经过以后，我还想提一下，在大部分这些国家里，都有相当数量的华侨。他们以极其强烈的感情来欢迎我们这些从祖国去的亲人。他们过去同侨居国人民一样长期受到殖民主义的剥削和压迫，现在，中华人民共和国在各方面的成就使他们感到高兴和光荣。我必须在这里向大家转达侨居在南亚各国的华侨对祖国的向往和敬意。我们也曾经代表中国政府和人民向他们表示问候，并且勉励他们尊重侨居国的法律和习惯，加强同侨居国人民的友谊，为促进中国和侨居国的友好关系而努力。
    同志们，朋友们：现在我想说一说我们在这些国家的访问中所得到的一些感想和意见。
    当我们在这些国家访问的时候，不论到那里，我们都有一种十分亲切的感觉。我们在这些国家里并不感到自己是在陌生的异国，而是感到自己像在亲密的朋友、亲戚和兄弟的家里。
    产生这种感觉，不但是因为我们到处都受到了极其热烈和友好的欢迎，而且还因为我们亲自体会到了这些国家的历史遭遇同我们中国是大致相同的，这些国家的民族愿望同我们中国也是大致相同的。
    我们在这次的访问中，在每一个国家都曾经参观了许多有意义的历史遗迹。他们告诉我们，我们亚洲人民是有光荣的历史的人民，是曾经对人类作出了伟大的贡献的人民。同时，在我们访问所到的地方，也都可以看到，我们亚洲人民之间有悠久的密切的历史联系。在历史的黎明时期，我们之间就开始有了来往。但是，自从西方殖民主义势力扩张到东方以后，苦难就临到了我们这个曾经以智慧的光辉照耀了古代世界的大洲。除了日本以外，几乎所有的亚洲国家都先后沦为西方帝国主义国家的殖民地，或者处于他们的势力控制之下。我们的民族受到了屈辱。我们的人民受到了奴役。我们各自的政治、经济和文化的发展受到了压抑和摧残。我们相互间在几千年来形成的联系受到了人为的破坏。这种共同的苦难培育了我们各国人民之间的同情，而我们为了反抗共同的敌人而进行的斗争，又更加加深了这种同情。
    我们这种长期的艰苦的反殖民主义斗争到第二次世界大战以后终于得到了胜利。殖民主义的体系在这种斗争的反复的冲击下开始解体了。在亚洲和非洲，一个又一个曾经沦为殖民地的国家取得了独立，一个又一个曾经处在外国控制下的国家摆脱了身上的枷锁。现在，当我们能够自由地站起来寻找友谊的时候，我们很自然地把极大的热情寄放在我们曾经同过患难的兄弟的身上，这是一种极其可贵的历史感情，它应该永远受到我们的珍爱。
    当然，我们亚非国家取得独立的道路是并不相同的。中国人民，蒙古人民，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的人民和越南民主共和国的人民，是在共产主义者的领导下取得了独立的，我们这些国家的人民已经走上社会主义的道路。其他许多亚非国家的人民是在民族主义者的领导下走上了独立和发展的道路的。我们并不讳言，我们各自的社会和政治制度是不同的，我们在许多问题上的观点也有不同。但是，这种不同并不妨碍我们之间的友好合作。所有已经取得独立的亚非各国的人民，都要求巩固自己的独立，都要求维护世界的和平，都要求增进我们各国间的友好合作。在这些方面，我们的愿望是相同的。
    所有我们访问过的亚洲国家的人民，都曾经为争取自己国家政治上的独立而作出了重大的牺牲。他们十分珍视自己的独立，同时，同中国人民一样，他们也认为我们这些国家的独立还是不巩固的，因为殖民主义势力还在从各方面威胁并且损害我们的独立。我们还必须坚持不懈地为维护自己的主权和独立而斗争。同时，我们这些国家的独立也还是不完全的，我们都还没有摆脱殖民主义给我们遗留下来的经济上和文化上的落后状态。因此，我们都要求建设自己的祖国，赶上现代国家的水平。只有这样，我们的独立才能真正巩固。此外，现在亚非地区还有很多国家没有获得独立，这些国家的人民争取独立的斗争，还在受着殖民主义的残酷的镇压。我们已经获得独立的亚非各国人民都同情和支持他们的斗争。
    所有我们访问过的这些国家的人民都渴望和平，痛恨战争。亚非人民在过去的几百年中已经吃尽了侵略战争的苦头。没有任何刚刚脱离了殖民主义压迫的亚非国家的人民愿意再被卷入战争。相反，只有在一个和平的国际环境中，亚非人民才能建设自己的祖国，才能取得安定和幸福的生活。然而，今天殖民主义者还在亚洲和非洲用他们组织的敌对性军事集团和他们的军事基地，控制着这个地区的一些国家的政治和经济，使这些国家的人民负担着沉重的军费，并且威胁着整个亚非地区的和平和安全。这种情况使我们亚非人民更加迫切地要求和平。正是因为如此，在这次访问中不论我们到什么地方，当千千万万的人们前来欢迎我们的时候，“和平”总是最突出、最响亮的口号。
    所有我们访问过的这些国家的人民也都要求同其他亚洲国家人民友好合作。在每一个国家里，千千万万人民对我们的热烈欢迎，决不仅仅是这些国家人民对中国人民的友谊的表现，而且也是亚洲各国人民要求加强彼此间的友好合作的愿望的表现。友好合作是亚洲人民的共同利益。殖民主义和战争势力至今并没有甘心于自己的失败，而且还正在寻找每一个机会，企图对亚洲人民发动新的进攻。他们特别希望利用我们相互间的分歧来实现他们的野心。“分而治之”，“亚洲人打亚洲人”，是他们从来没有放弃过的阴谋。在这样的威胁面前，亚非各国只有团结起来友好合作，才能有力量保卫各自的独立，才能有力量维护亚洲和全世界的和平。
    当然，我们也看到在亚非国家之间并不是没有分歧和争端的，但是可以说，几乎所有这些分歧和争端都是殖民主义者在长时期内实行“分而治之”的政策所造成的，或者也是他们的这种政策所扩大化了的。殖民主义者现在还想以此在我们中间制造不和，为他们自己制造机会。我们认为，我们亚非国家之间所有悬而未决的问题，都应该通过和平协商的途径，得到公平合理的解决，而决不应该让任何分歧和争端妨碍我们的团结。
    在目前亚洲各国的关系中，存在在印度和巴基斯坦之间的克什米尔问题，引起了邻近各国的深深不安。我们曾经向印度和巴基斯坦的领导人表示希望双方能够通过和平协商来寻求这个问题的解决。锡兰总理班达拉奈克和我在今年2月5日发表的联合声明中，也曾经共同呼吁双方，为了他们自己的利益，同时也为了亚非团结的更广泛的利益，进一步争取这个问题的和平解决。在这里，我们愿意再一次表示这样的愿望。我们认为，印度和巴基斯坦两个姊妹国家是可以通过和平协商求得这个问题的友好的解决的，而在美国控制联合国的情况下，把这个问题提交联合国，只能够引起外国干涉的危险。
    在许多亚非国家之间，都有由殖民主义统治遗留下来的边界问题。这类问题是比较复杂的，比较难于解决的。但是，根据我们的经验，只要有关双方能够相见以诚，按照五项原则和万隆决议的精神进行协商，这类问题也是可以求得友好的解决的。大家知道，在中国和缅甸之间存在着未决的边界问题，在我们开始这次访问以前，我们两国曾经利用缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努访问中国的机会，对这个问题进行了友好的商谈。在我们访问缅甸期间，我们又曾经同当时的缅甸吴巴瑞总理、吴努主席和其他领导人谈到了这个问题。这些会谈的结果使我们深信，历史上遗留下来的中缅边界问题是可以得到友好的解决的。随着这个问题的解决，我们两国的友谊一定会得到更进一步的巩固和发展。中国政府在这个问题上采取的立场，不但是从维护中国民族利益出发的，也是从促进中缅友谊和亚非团结的利益出发的。
    1955年在万隆举行的亚非会议，第一次共同发出了亚洲人民和非洲人民要求反对殖民主义、维护和争取民族独立、保卫世界和平和促进友好合作的响亮呼声。现在，这个呼声已经越来越有力了。许多过去被分离被隔绝的亚非国家在那个历史性的会议上重建起来的友谊，在将近两年以来已经得到了长足的发展。我们以亲身的体验证实，万隆精神决没有像它的敌人所希望的那样枯萎了，而是正在继续不断地繁荣滋长。和平共处的五项原则正在为越来越多的国家所接受。我们这次同许多亚洲国家的领导人所发表的联合声明和联合公报就是明证。在这些文件里，万隆决议和五项原则一再得到了重申。1954年6月中国和印度两国总理在首次提出五项原则的联合声明中曾经指出：五项原则的广泛适用，将形成和平和安全的坚固基础，并且将有助于创造和扩大和平地区，从而减少战争的可能，加强全世界的和平事业。我们现在满意地看到，这种希望正在日益变为现实。
    在我们开始这次访问之前不久所发生的埃及事件，最明显地表现了亚非团结的力量和作用。在我们所到的国家，到处都可以看到人们对埃及人民表示的同情和声援。在亚洲和非洲的广大人民和全世界一切爱好和平的力量的支持下，埃及人民经过坚决的斗争已经击退了殖民主义者的侵略。他们保卫自己的主权和领土完整、保卫亚非地区和平的斗争已经取得了初步的胜利。这个事实给了我们亚非人民极大的鼓舞。同时，我们也得到了极大的启示：虽然亚洲和非洲国家在物质力量方面还不是强大的，但是只要我们坚持亚非各国的团结，坚持同世界上一切爱好和平的力量的团结，进行坚决的斗争，就没有什么殖民主义的侵略是不能打退的。
    我们在亚洲访问中所看到的事实使我们深信，中华人民共和国自从成立以来所一贯坚持的努力促进亚非国家友好合作的主张，是完全符合于我们亚非各国的民族利益的，同时也是符合于维护亚非和世界和平的普遍利益的。我们决心继续在严格遵守五项原则的基础上，同我们这次访问过的国家和其他亚非国家，努力发展和加强友好合作关系。就是对于今天同中国还没有正常关系的邻国，例如泰国和菲律宾，新加坡和马来亚，我们认为也没有理由不能改善我们同他们之间的关系。事实上，我们同某些亚非国家之间虽然还没有正式的外交关系，但是已经建立了经济和文化的关系。我还愿意特别指出，正如在中苏联合声明中所表示的那样，进一步促进中国和日本关系的正常化是应该提上议事日程了。
    我们愿意按照万隆会议的决议，尽可能地加强同亚非国家在经济上和文化上平等互利的合作，以促进彼此的民族经济和民族文化的独立发展。事实证明，虽然我们亚非国家之间在这方面的合作还开始不久，规模也还很小，但是已经产生良好的结果。随着我们各自的建设事业的发展，我们的合作规模将会日益扩大。目前，中国在力所能及的范围内，正在向某些亚非国家提供一些经济援助。这些援助就其数量来说是极其微小的，然而是不附带任何条件的，这表示了我们帮助这些国家独立发展的真诚愿望。我们同任何国家的经济合作或者对任何国家的经济援助都是在五项原则的基础上进行的，因而并不排斥这些国家同任何别的国家进行经济合作或者接受任何别的国家的经济援助。我们愿意看到一切对亚非国家的经济合作和援助，都不附带任何条件，真正是为了帮助不发达的国家得到独立发展。
    我们还愿意向我们在亚洲和非洲的各友好国家学习他们优秀的民族文化和他们在建设工作中的长处。我们在这次访问中亲眼看到了，虽然这些亚洲国家一般说来还是比较落后的，但是每一个国家，不论大小，都各有优点和长处。如果我们能够认真地互相学习，我们相信这一定能够有助于我们亚非国家的各自发展。
    同志们，朋友们：通过这次访问，我们更加清楚地看到了亚洲和非洲正在觉醒和复兴。独立了的和正在争取独立的亚非国家已经作为一种新的强大的和平力量出现在世界舞台上。万隆会议第一次证明了这个力量的存在，埃及事件又更加明显地证明了这个力量的发展。亚非人民自己掌握亚非地区命运的时代已经到来了。这是我们这个时代的一个重大的特征。尽管殖民主义的势力还在企图破坏我们亚非国家的独立，镇压我们这个地区的民族独立运动，挑拨我们相互间的友好团结，但是，这决不能挽救殖民主义的死亡，也决不能阻挡亚非人民的前进。曾经长期是殖民主义侵略的对象的亚非地区，一定要成为独立国家和平共处和友好合作的大家庭。	（四）
    在我们出国访问的期间，中近东一直是国际局势的焦点。紧接着英法对埃及的侵略被击退以后，美国政府就宣布了所谓艾森豪威尔主义，公开主张由美国来填补英法殖民主义者在中近东地区遗留下来的所谓真空，使中近东局势重新趋于紧张。因此，我们有必要把这个问题特别提出来谈一下。
    中近东紧张局势的发展过程，充分地表现出帝国主义国家之间矛盾的尖锐化，特别是美国同英法的矛盾的尖锐化。去年，英法利用美国处于大选前夕的这一时机，勾结以色列，对埃及发动了突然的武装进攻，企图搞垮纳赛尔总统领导下的埃及政府，恢复他们在苏伊士运河地区的统治，抵抗美国排挤英法在中近东地区殖民利益的政策。但是，英法的算盘却完全打错了。英法对埃及的侵略，遭到了埃及人民和阿拉伯各国人民的坚决反抗，埃及政府在反抗侵略的英勇斗争中不是削弱而是更加巩固了。
    同时，在同英法争夺中近东的殖民利益的斗争中，美国对英法进行了坚决的反击。在联合国中，美国支持了亚非集团要求英法停止对埃及的武装侵略和撤退侵略军队的提案。但是，难道美国真正有爱于埃及人民，主张维护埃及的主权和独立吗？不是的。正如我在出国访问的初期回答记者的问题中所指出过的，美国的目的只是为了夺取和代替英法在中近东的殖民地位。艾森豪威尔主义完全证实了这一点。现在，从表面上来看，美国似乎是主张以色列撤军的。但是，难道美国真正反对以色列的侵略，维护阿拉伯各国人民的利益和中近东的和平吗？不是的。美国的目的只是为了排挤英法对以色列的控制，并且利用以色列和阿拉伯国家的冲突，继续维持中近东地区的紧张局势，以便在联合国的名义下侵犯埃及的主权和扩大它自己在中近东地区的殖民势力。
    美国政府这次提出艾森豪威尔主义，又是用反对共产主义威胁的口号做烟幕。其实，所谓苏联或者任何其他社会主义国家对中近东形成威胁的话，是没有任何事实根据的。苏联和其他社会主义国家一贯主张尊重中近东国家的主权和独立，主张由中近东人民自己决定中近东的事务。我们这次在民族主义国家中的访问更加证明了，社会主义国家同民族主义国家在和平共处五项原则的基础上合作得很好。事实上，目前威胁着中近东各国的正是美国的艾森豪威尔主义。它集中地表现了美国政府进行扩张和侵略的惯技，那就是，以反共、反苏为借口，以制造紧张局势为手段，来达到镇压民族独立运动、排挤英法殖民利益和扩大自己殖民势力的目的。这就是美国新殖民主义的实质。
    美国政府这种不断制造紧张局势以便进行扩张和侵略的政策，不仅受到一切爱好和平的国家和人民的坚决反对，而且也不可避免地使帝国主义国家之间的矛盾更加尖锐化。
    在国际局势紧张到了一定的程度，在来自各方面的压力不断加强的情况下，美国政府有时也不能不同意一些和缓局势的措施。但是，美国侵略集团是害怕国际局势真正有所和缓的，因为这将使他们失去在所谓自由世界中的领导地位，使他们的军事集团日趋松懈，而亚非各国人民在和缓的国际局势中会愈加走向独立发展的道路。因此，每当国际局势真正有所和缓的时候，美国侵略集团就迫不及待地制造新的紧张，竭力阻挠局势的进一步和缓。这就是美国政府追求紧张而又不能过分紧张、被迫和缓而又不敢长期和缓，因而在和缓和紧张之间不断摇摆的根源。
    但是，美国政府这种政策是不能持久的。越来越多的国家已经不再为美国的反共反苏的口号所欺骗，不再为美国所制造的紧张局势所吓倒，也不再愿意使自己的利益不断地受到美国的侵犯。另一方面，就美国来说，继续执行这种政策，也只能使它自己越来越陷入孤立的地位。
    公开宣布要夺取英法殖民利益的艾森豪威尔主义，对于参加美国军事集团的国家来说，是一个很有益的教训。为了扩张自己的殖民势力，美国不惜公开侵犯它的主要盟国英法的利益。像英法这样的主要盟国，美国都可以抛弃，那么又有什么所谓盟国，美国不可以抛弃呢？追随美国的国家，一方面要经常冒着被抛弃的危险，另一方面却又不能不使自己受到美国的控制。而他们从美国那里得到的只是一些剩余的军事物资和倾销的商品，因为从美国看来，正如洛克菲勒在1956年1月给艾森豪威尔的信中所说，“已经是上钩的鱼儿用不着诱饵”了。但是，这些国家自己却不得不担负着沉重的军费，使国民经济日趋破产。这些事实不能不使这些国家的当局重新考虑他们自己的政策。
    如果说，有些国家曾经对艾森豪威尔主义抱有一定的幻想，认为可以把其中的军事部分同所谓经济援助分割开来，那么，上述的洛克菲勒给艾森豪威尔的信提供了有益的教训。洛克菲勒就是主张把军事同盟同“经济援助”分别开来的。但是，正像他自己所说的一样，这是为了“在稍后的一个阶段……加紧提出政治上的代价和军事上的要求”，为了使接受这种“援助”的国家“陷入过分庞大的工程上，从而长期需要美国的支持”。
    对于那些曾经希望美国主持公道、支持民族独立运动的国家来说，艾森豪威尔主义也提供了有益的教训。美国政府的目的，就是要控制中近东地区，绝不会真正支持阿拉伯各国的民族独立运动。人们应该记得，在苏伊士运河问题上，正是美国首先提出了所谓国际管制的“集体侵略”计划。事实上，正像洛克菲勒给艾森豪威尔的同一封信中所说的，美国决不能让“要求独立的愿望”发展成为“十分强烈的民族主义”，“以致于不仅老殖民国家不能控制，而且美国也不能控制”。
    英法两国也应该从埃及事件中吸取应有的教训。殖民主义的时代已经一去不复返了。对争取和维护民族独立的国家和人民使用武力，决不会给他们自己带来任何的好处。依靠美国的力量也决不能维持他们的利益，而只能更加便利于美国夺取这些利益。宗主国和殖民地的关系必须由新的互相尊重主权和独立的关系来代替。这样的平等互利的关系，也只有在和平共处的基础上才能建立起来。英法两国的人民对于他们的政府追随美国而日益成为美国的附庸的现象，已经愈来愈加不满。最近，在这两个国家里，组织国际上“第三种力量”的呼声又有了新的高涨，这也决不是偶然的。
    随着美国政府的扩张和侵略的政策的暴露和破产，越来越多的国家走上了和平中立的道路；事实证明，这个道路是符合于有关各国的民族利益的。根据和平中立的政策，他们有可能维护自己的独立而不受美国的控制，他们有可能把自己的军费减少到最低的限度，把自己的资源用到发展国家建设的方面。在和平中立的政策下，他们没有必要使自己同社会主义国家在平等互利基础上的经济和贸易关系受到限制，而且有可能从多方面争取到不附任何条件的经济援助。因此，就是在参加了美国组织的军事集团的国家里，也出现了走向和平中立的趋势。即使在仍然受着美国控制的日本，和平中立的倾向也有了发展。
    虽然如此，人们仍然不能忽视战争威胁的存在，因为帝国主义侵略势力不会自动地放弃他们的扩军备战政策。因此，一切爱好和平的国家和人民必须坚决反对帝国主义的战争阴谋。如果帝国主义者竟然不顾世界人民的反对，冒险发动侵略战争，那么，在一切爱好和平的国家和人民的联合力量的面前，可以断言，帝国主义一定会遭到最后的失败。两次世界大战的结果已经清楚地证明，不仅发动战争的国家一定失败，而且整个帝国主义体系都遭到削弱。在今天的时代里，对于任何帝国主义国家来说，战争都不可能再是发财的机会。另一次世界大战只能导致帝国主义更快、更彻底的失败。
    社会主义国家一贯主张社会制度不同的国家应该和平共处，民族主义国家的和平中立政策应该得到尊重，殖民地人民民族独立的愿望应该得到实现。中国政府完全支持苏联1956年11月17日关于裁军问题的建议和1957年2月11日关于中近东问题的建议。我们高兴地看到，这些建议不仅获得了社会主义国家的一致支持，而且也获得了印度和其他许多民族主义国家的同情。我们还特别高兴地看到，最近埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯和约旦的四国首脑会议重申四国坚持民族独立和中立的政策，主张阿拉伯世界的防务应该处于外国公约的范围之外。这是符合于各大国不干涉中近东地区国家内政的原则的，也是符合于世界和平的利益的。
    在我们这次访问的期间，不少国家对于中美关系表示关心，好意地希望促进中美关系的改善。中国人民是愿意同美国人民友好的，但是，中美关系长期没有能够得到改善，责任并不在我们方面。正是美国政府利用中美间的国际争端作为制造远东紧张局势中的一环，阻挠着中美关系的改善。
    为了改进中美关系，中国方面曾经作了一系列的努力。早在万隆会议期间，我们就建议，通过和平谈判解决中美两国之间在台湾地区的争端，和缓和消除台湾地区的紧张局势。在中美两国大使的日内瓦会谈中，我们还建议消除目前存在在两国贸易、两国人民来往和文化交流中的障碍。在中美两国大使级的会谈长期没有获得进展的情况下，我们还建议举行中美两国外长会议，解决中美两国之间悬而未决的问题。但是，中国方面的这一切努力都没有从美国方面得到应有的反应。
    相反地，美国政府坚持敌视中国人民的政策。朝鲜停战以后，美国就破坏了关于战俘问题的协议，把大批的中国被俘人员送到台湾。美国不仅拒绝承认中华人民共和国，而且还阻挠其他国家同中国建立友好关系。美国继续在国际事务中排斥中国，在联合国中继续阻挠中国合法地位的恢复。美国继续对中国实施着禁运，并且还在加紧阻挠其他国家同中国发展平等互利的贸易。尤其严重的是美国不仅拒绝对台湾地区紧张局势的问题进行认真的谈判，而且还加紧它对台湾的军事控制，扩充它在台湾的军事基地，并且计划在台湾设置导弹，蓄意加剧台湾地区的紧张局势。不仅如此，美国还企图通过中美会谈使中国承认美国侵占台湾的现状，制造所谓两个中国的形势。我们愿意通过和平谈判解决中美之间的国际争端，但是，我们维护国家主权和解放台湾的决心是不可动摇的，美国政府制造“两个中国”的阴谋是绝对不能得逞的。
    台湾是中国的领土。台湾的居民，包括一切国民党军政人员在内，都是中国人。解放台湾是中国的内政，是中国人自己能够解决的问题。自从我们号召争取和平解放台湾以来，台湾国民党军政人员中愿意促进和平解放的人越来越多，和平解放台湾的可能性也越来越大了。但是，对于这种情况，美国政府却表现了极端的恐惧，不惜采取一切办法进行破坏。最近，美国策动一批标榜所谓自由中国的分子和所谓台湾独立的分子，进行推翻台湾当局的活动，企图把台湾变成像檀香山一样的美国属地。其实，美国政府这种手段只能使一切爱国的中国人更加认清美国政府企图奴役中国的真面目。今天美国既然可以发动一个推翻台湾当局的运动，明天美国又何尝不可以抛弃那些标榜所谓自由中国和台湾独立的分子呢？卖国求荣不仅无荣可得，而且还将遗臭万年。一切有血性的中国人，都应该本着爱国一家的精神，团结起来，一致对外，粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋。
    美国政府敌视中国人民的政策，丝毫不能影响中国的存在和发展。中华人民共和国不仅已经屹立在世界上，而且还将沿着社会主义的道路不断地发展和壮大起来。美国政府把台湾变成美国属地的企图，不仅将受到一切爱国的中国人民的坚决反对，而且也将为世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民所不许。台湾回到祖国怀抱的大势是不可阻挡的。世界上没有任何力量可以把中国人同中国人永远分割开来。
    同志们，朋友们：世界总的趋势是走向和缓、走向进步的。和平的力量正在不断地壮大，战争的势力已经越来越加孤立。只要社会主义国家、民族主义国家和一切爱好和平的国家和人民团结起来，坚持斗争，世界的持久和平是可以争取得到的。中国人民将在这个伟大的斗争中担负起自己应有的责任，继续为世界和平和人类进步的事业作出坚持不懈的努力。
