Xinhua News Agency, March 6th – According to TASS, Rome: "Unità" published on the 5th the resolution adopted by the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party at its recent plenary session. The plenary session, in the spirit of the resolutions of the Eighth Party Congress, discussed the report by Party Deputy General Secretary Longo on the tasks of Communist Party members in the struggle of the working class.

    The plenary session endorsed Longo's report and the political tasks proposed in the report. The resolution pointed out the imbalance in Italy's economic development, saying that Italy's economy includes both pre-capitalist economic forms and a monopoly capitalist system. The nature and conditions of this economic development, the government's policies, and the excessive power of monopoly capital are not mitigating, but rather exacerbating the original contradictions: the contradiction between backward and developed regions, between northern and southern Italy, and between production and sales. Not only are the original contradictions deepening, but new ones are also emerging. The existence of a large number of unemployed people, the disparity between profit and wage levels, the disparity between workers' wages and living expenses, and the continuous expansion of the disparity between labor intensity and remuneration are the most obvious manifestations of the intensification of contradictions.

    The resolution then pointed out that the working class's struggle should be unfolded in the following aspects: defending the living and working conditions of the working people; defending the rights and freedoms of the working people; struggling for the implementation of a new economic policy; and struggling for a new political leadership of the country.

    The Central Committee reiterated its support for the program proposed by the Italian General Confederation of Labor: demanding higher wages, shorter working days while maintaining existing wages, and defending the freedom of workers and the trade union rights of the working people.

    The resolution finally emphasized the importance of working-class unity. It pointed out that the unity of the working class is the main condition for strengthening and developing the struggle of the working class, and this unity should mainly be achieved in common struggles.

    Norwegian Communist Party Calls on Peace Forces to Unite
    Strive to Make Norway Adopt a Position of Peace and Coexistence

    Xinhua News Agency, March 6th – According to TASS, Oslo: "Friheten" published on the 5th the statement of the Ninth Congress of the Norwegian Communist Party on the international situation. The statement analyzed the recent developments in the international situation and emphasized that the Suez incident once again exposed the serious contradictions among the great powers in the struggle to control oil-producing areas and control foreign countries. This not only constantly threatens the freedom of millions of people in the colonies but also constantly threatens peace and hinders the easing of international tensions and peaceful coexistence among countries.

    The Atlantic Treaty links Norway with Britain and France in a military alliance. This harbors a serious danger that our country may be dragged into a world war, standing on the side of the imperialists against the people struggling for independence. Under these circumstances, the Norwegian workers' movement should strive to ensure that Norway's foreign policy opposes imperialist oppression and war policies and consistently adheres to a position of peace and peaceful coexistence. In order to achieve this goal, all peace forces in our country should unite and jointly put forward the following demands: immediately stop nuclear and hydrogen bomb tests, ban thermonuclear weapons, dissolve all military blocs, abolish military bases established in other countries and withdraw all troops from other countries' territories, strengthen the United Nations, expand international relations on the basis of collective security and peaceful coexistence, reduce armaments, recognize the rights of all peoples to independence, and expand economic and cultural ties between countries.

    Discuss Preparations for the Congress and Participation in Elections

    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 6th – German News Agency, Düsseldorf, March 5th: The Central Committee of the German Communist Party held its third meeting in early March.

German Communist Party First Secretary Lehmann made the main report at the meeting.

    The communique issued by the meeting said: "After thorough discussion, the Central Committee adopted the draft program of the Congress. The draft program will be distributed to all party members to fully prepare for the Congress. In addition, the meeting also determined the election platform for the Federal Parliament elections. The meeting showed a firm fighting will and a spirit of full confidence. The Central Committee expressed unwavering sympathy for the imprisoned comrades' heroic struggle for peace and freedom and reiterated the demand for immediate political amnesty."

    Canadian Labour Progressive Party General Secretary Discusses Sixth Party Congress
    Party Unity and Solidarity Will Be Further Strengthened

    Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, March 6th – TASS Ottawa 6th: Buck, General Secretary of the Labour Progressive Party of Canada, commented in the March issue of "National Affairs" on the draft political resolution to be discussed at the Sixth Congress of the Labour Progressive Party of Canada in April this year.

    Buck pointed out that the draft resolution confirms the principles of Marxism-Leninism as the foundation for the establishment of the Labour Progressive Party and formulates the party's action program for striving for socialism in Canada.

    Buck resolutely criticized the liquidationists and right-wing opportunists who demanded the abandonment of the basic principles of Leninism. He expressed his belief that the upcoming Party Congress will be held under the slogan of strengthening unity and further uniting the ranks of the party.

    意共、德共、挪共和加劳工进步党
    决定加强争取和平民主的斗争
    意共中央全会通过决议
    号召争取国家的新的政治领导
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社罗马讯：“团结报”5日刊载了意大利共产党中央委员会最近举行的全体会议通过的决议。这次全会根据第八次党代表大会的决议的精神讨论了党的副总书记隆哥关于共产党员在工人阶级斗争中的任务的报告。
    全体会议赞同隆哥的报告和报告中提出的政治任务。决议指出意大利经济发展的不平衡现象说，在意大利经济中，既有资本主义前的经济形态，又有垄断资本主义制度。这种经济发展的性质和条件、政府的政策以及垄断资本的过分大的权势都不是减轻、而是加深了原有的种种矛盾：落后地区和发达地区之间的矛盾，意大利北部和南部之间的矛盾，生产和销售之间的矛盾。不但加深了原有的矛盾，而且还在产生新的矛盾。大批失业人数的存在以及利润水平和工资水平的悬殊、工人工资和生活费用的悬殊、劳动强度和报酬额的悬殊的不断扩大，这些就是矛盾加剧的最明显的表现。
    决议接着指出，应当在下列几方面展开工人阶级的斗争：保卫劳动人民的生活条件和劳动条件；保卫劳动人民的权利和自由；为争取实行新的经济方针而斗争；为争取国家的新的政治领导而斗争。
    中央全会再次表示支持意大利总工会提出的纲领：要求提高工资，在保持原有工资条件下缩短工作日，保卫工人的自由和劳动人民的工会权利。
    决议最后强调了工人阶级团结的重要性。它指出，工人阶级的团结是加强和发展工人阶级斗争的主要条件，这种团结主要应该在共同的斗争中求得。
    挪共号召和平力量团结起来
    争取使挪威采取和平和共处的立场
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社奥斯陆讯：“自由报”5日刊载了挪威共产党第九次代表大会关于国际局势的声明。声明分析了最近国际局势的发展，并且着重指出，苏伊士事件再次暴露了列强在争取控制石油产地和控制外国的斗争中的严重矛盾。这不仅经常威胁殖民地千千万万人民的自由，同时还经常威胁和平，妨碍国际紧张局势的和缓和各国间的和平共处。
    大西洋公约把挪威同英法两国连结在一个军事联盟里。这就包藏着一种严重的危险，使我国可能被卷入世界大战，站在帝国主义者一边去反对为争取独立而斗争的人民。在这种情况下，挪威工人运动应当努力争取使挪威的外交政策反对帝国主义压迫和战争政策，始终一贯地坚持和平和和平共处的立场。为了达到这个目的，我国的一切和平力量应当团结起来，共同提出下列要求：立刻停止原子弹和氢弹的试验，禁止热核子武器，解散一切军事集团，取消在他国建立的军事基地并且一切军队撤离他国领土，加强联合国，在集体安全和和平共处的基础上扩大国际联系，裁减军备，承认各国人民独立的权利，扩大各国间的经济和文化联系。

    布克指出，决议草案确认马克思列宁主义原则为劳工进步党的建党基础，并且拟订了党在加拿大争取社会主义的行动纲领。
