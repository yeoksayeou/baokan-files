    A Few Small Things
    Zhang Wei
    Many small things are ordinary, yet they make you remember them for a long time.
    Last year, I lived in the countryside of Shandong for a while and really wanted to see the latest newspaper. Once, after boarding the Yantai-Lancun train, I eagerly asked the conductor if they had newspapers, but he replied, "We don't have any for sale." Disappointed, I sat down, my eyes staring blankly out the window.
    Not long after, a newspaper suddenly appeared in front of me. I reached for it eagerly, but suddenly pulled my hand back. I looked up and saw the conductor smiling and saying, "Comrade, I borrowed it for you."
    I took it and thanked him repeatedly, even becoming a little animated. He looked at me amusingly, smiled, and said, "Isn't this what we should do?"
   "Oh, is this what you should do?" I thought.
    After changing trains and arriving in Qingdao, I walked into the Xinhua Bookstore and suddenly saw the newly published "One Day of the Volunteers" on the shelf. I exclaimed in surprise and hurried to grab a copy, wanting to look for works written by my old leaders and comrades-in-arms. As I closed the book, I saw a female bookstore clerk standing in front of me; she smiled and asked, "Do you want to buy this book? It's really good." I said regretfully, "I still have to go to the countryside, it's not convenient on the road." I apologetically started to put the book back on the shelf, but she frankly took it, stood on tiptoe, and laboriously swung her two long braids, putting the book back on the shelf. I had just turned to leave when I suddenly heard her hurriedly call out, "Liberation Army comrade!" I stopped. I saw her anxiously squeezing through the crowd, saying, "Comrade, I forgot to tell you, this book is a bestseller, you should buy it quickly when you get back, or it will be sold out."
    I was very moved and said "Thank you" repeatedly. She smiled modestly, as if to say, "Isn't this what we should do?"
   "Is this also what you should do?" I thought again.
    Seeing that there was still some time, I went into the canteen near the station. After ordering the dishes, the waiter was about to leave; suddenly, he leaned over and asked me, "Comrade, are you taking this train?" Hearing me say "yes," he took off running, quickly brought the food and wiped the sweat from his face with his scarf, smiling, "Comrade, don't panic, you can eat slowly." Just as I had finished eating, he rushed past me like a gust of wind, glanced at the clock, and said to me, "Comrade, perfect, there's only a quarter of an hour left." I stood up, wanting to thank him again and again, but with a shout, he lightly went off to greet others. So many strangers come and go, yet he has such broad concern and enthusiasm for people.
    If you were to thank him, he would certainly answer in surprise, "Isn't this what we should do?"
    Yes, it is what we should do. My comrades and friends whom I remember and cherish, on the land of our motherland, there are no strangers.

    几件小事
    张惟
    许多小事是平常的，但却使你长久地念念不忘。
    去年，我在山东农村住了一个时候，很想看看最近的报纸。一次，刚登上烟台—蓝村线的列车，就急着问列车员同志有没有报纸，不料他的回答是“没有得卖”。我失望地坐下来，眼睛怔怔地望着车窗外。
    过了不多时候，突然有一张报纸伸到我的面前，我抢着去接，猛然又缩回了手；我抬起头，看见那个列车员微笑地说：“同志，我替你借的。”
    我接过来，连声地道谢，甚至有点手舞足蹈起来。他有趣地望了望我，笑了笑说：“这不是我们应该的么？”
   “哦，这是应该的么？”我想。
    转车到了青岛，走进新华书店，猛然看见了书架上新出版的“志愿军一日”，我惊奇地“啊”了一声，忙去抽了一册，想找一找老首长和老战友写的作品。我合上书，看见一位书店的女服务员站在面前；她笑着问：“你要买这本书？真好。”我惋惜地说：“我还要下乡，路上不方便。”我抱歉地想把书插回架上去，她却坦然地接过去，踮起脚尖，吃力地摆动着两根长长的辫子，把书插回架上去。我才扭转身走，忽然又听她匆促地喊：“解放军同志，”我停住了脚，只见她着急地从人群中挤过来，说道：“同志，我忘了告诉你，这本书是畅销货，你回去后要快点买，要不就光了。”
    我很感动，连声地“谢谢。”她谦逊地笑笑，似乎是说：“这不是我们应该的么？”
   “这也是应该的么？”我又想。
    看看还有点时间，我走进车站附近的食堂里。点了菜，招待员同志刚要走；忽然他又俯身问我：“同志，你是不是乘的这班车？”听我说声“是”，他拔腿就跑，飞快地把饭菜端来，喘着气，用围巾揩了一下脸上的汗珠，笑着说：“同志，你别慌，还可以慢慢吃。”等到我刚刚吃完，他一阵风似地又走过我的身边，瞧了瞧钟向我说：“同志，正好，现在只差一刻钟了。”我站起来，想再三地谢谢他，那知一声叫唤，他又轻快地去招呼别人了。来来往往有多少陌生的人，但他对于人是有着多么宽厚的关注和热情。
    你要谢他，他肯定是诧异地回答说：“这不是我们应该的么？”
    是的，是应该的。我所感念不忘的同志们和朋友们，在我们祖国的土地上，没有陌生的旅人。
