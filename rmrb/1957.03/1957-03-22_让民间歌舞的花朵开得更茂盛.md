Having watched the National Folk Music and Dance Performance for over ten days, I feel like I've been on a meaningful and interesting journey. Each day felt like visiting new places and seeing fresh folk music and dances with strong national styles and local characteristics. Although the programs participating in this performance are only a small part of the thousands of folk music and dances from more than twenty ethnic groups in various regions, they are truly dazzling and breathtaking. We heard the people from the Inner Mongolian grasslands singing passionately about their beloved steeds; we also saw the Tibetan people dancing the string dance with a strong rhythm to express their love for the motherland; the Korean girls carrying water on their heads welcomed the morning sun with light dance steps; the people of Xinjiang sang and danced in praise of labor; the fishermen of Fujian sang fishing songs praising love... These songs and dances brought us to completely different situations. The people in the Han areas have such rich festivals: Zunyi in Guizhou has the "Red Army Lantern" to commemorate the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, Jiangxi has the "Carp Lantern" that brings the paper-made fish to life, Zhejiang has the exquisite "Hundred-Leaf Dragon", as well as the courageous "Lion Dance" from Henan, and the heart-shaking percussion performance from Heilongjiang... These crystallizations of the wisdom of the people give us great artistic enjoyment. Through these performances, we felt the vastness of the motherland's territory, smelled the fragrance of the motherland's land, and experienced the endless power of all ethnic groups.
Our ancestors created valuable material wealth through hard work, and also created song and dance art to encourage and entertain themselves. Today, we must inherit this legacy. How exciting it is to hear and see some ancient music, folk music, and dances that are about to be lost being excavated, mastered by the younger generation, and appearing on the stage of the capital. Our song and dance workers must continue to advance towards the folk art treasures like geological exploration personnel exploring treasures in the deep mountains; we will surely get more and better treasures.
In this performance, we saw some programs created and performed by the song and dance groups of agricultural cooperatives, which shows the further development of folk music and dance art, and has a more reliable foundation and favorable conditions. The agricultural cooperation movement enables the vast number of farmers to get rid of poverty and gradually establish a prosperous material life, and it will also enable the vast number of farmers to obtain a rich spiritual life. Thousands of song and dance groups in agricultural cooperatives will be established like mushrooms after a rain, and the flowers of laboring people's wisdom—folk music and dance—will bloom more luxuriantly and beautifully!

    让民间歌舞的花朵开得更茂盛
　　朱树兰
    看了十多天全国民间音乐舞蹈会演，我觉得自己像在作一次有意义、有趣味的旅行。每一天都像走到了一些新的地方，看到了一些新鲜的、有着浓厚民族风格和地方色彩的民间音乐舞蹈。虽然这一次参加会演的节目，只是各地区二十多个民族、几千几万种民间音乐舞蹈中很少的一部分，却真是琳琅满目，美不胜收。我们听到了来自内蒙古草原上的人们奔放地歌唱心爱的骏马；我们也看到了藏族人们跳起节奏强烈的弦子舞，来表达他们热爱祖国的心情；朝鲜族顶水的姑娘迈着轻快的舞步迎接朝霞；新疆人民载歌载舞地赞颂劳动；福建渔民唱起歌颂爱情的渔歌……。这歌声、这舞姿把我们带到了迥然不同的情境中。汉族地区的人民有着多么丰富的节日：贵州遵义有怀念中国工农红军的“红军灯”，江西有把纸扎的鱼儿都耍活了的“鲤鱼灯”，浙江有精致巧妙的“百叶龙”，还有河南的勇猛的“狮舞”，黑龙江的震荡人心的打击乐演奏，……这许多人民群众智慧的结晶，给了我们极大的艺术享受。透过这些表演，我们感到了祖国地域的广大辽阔，闻到了祖国大地的芬芳，体会了各族人民无穷无尽的力量。
    我们的祖先在辛勤的劳动中创造了宝贵的物质财富，也创造了鼓舞、欢娱自己的歌舞艺术。今天，我们一定要继承这份遗产。听到和看到一些将要失传的古乐、民乐、舞蹈被发掘出来，掌握在年青的一代手中，出现在首都的舞台上，怎不令人兴奋。我们的歌舞工作者要像地质勘探人员深山探宝一样，继续向民间的艺术宝藏前进；我们一定能得到更多、更美好的珍宝。
    在这次会演中，我们看到了一些农业社的歌舞小组创作和演出的节目，这说明了民间音乐舞蹈艺术的进一步发展，有了更可靠的基础和有利条件。农业合作化运动使得广大的农民能够摆脱贫困，逐步建立起富裕的物质生活，它也会使广大的农民得到丰富的精神生活。千万个农业社的歌舞小组将会雨后春笋般地建立起来，劳动人民智慧的花朵——民间音乐舞蹈，将会开得更茂盛、更美丽！
