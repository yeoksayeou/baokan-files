Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: The Third National Education Administration Conference was held in Beijing from the 18th to the 28th. The conference focused on discussing the arrangements for education undertakings in 1957, strengthening political and ideological education in schools at all levels, and the arrangement of teaching plans for primary and secondary schools and teacher training schools.

　　The conference held that the development of education last year somewhat exceeded possible conditions, with the teaching staff, equipment, and basic construction all falling behind the requirements of development. This year's development of education undertakings must be based on a fully reliable foundation. Based on the country's manpower, material resources, and financial conditions, appropriate development should be made under the principle of ensuring a certain quality.

　　The conference believed that the development of primary education must break away from the idea of being solely the responsibility of the state. In cities, it is necessary to promote schools run by streets, government agencies, factories, and mines; in rural areas, it is necessary to promote schools run collectively by the masses. Privately run schools can be allowed, but not encouraged. After these schools are established, the administrative management of the schools can be the responsibility of a board of directors elected from among the parents, with the education administrative department providing supervision and guidance. In short, it is better to have more schools than fewer, and better to be literate than illiterate.

　　The conference believed that the establishment of middle schools should be appropriately decentralized in the future, changing the past shortcomings of being too large in scale and excessively concentrated in cities. In particular, the development of junior high schools should face the countryside in the future. Many "capped" schools (primary schools adding junior high school classes) were established last year. These schools should not be easily adjusted or merged, and the decision to separate or merge should be based on local conditions. When adjustments are necessary, they should be discussed with the local masses to obtain their consent. However, it is necessary to prevent the crowding out of primary schools due to the retention of "capped" schools. The conference emphasized that rural middle schools mainly provide young people with the necessary basic knowledge, improving upon primary education so that they can better participate in production after graduation. Therefore, the teaching quality of rural junior high schools should not be strictly required to be the same as that of cities.

　　The conference believed that political and ideological education is the soul of school education. At present, there is a tendency for general education to be divorced from reality, manifested in the insufficient combination of education and politics, and the disconnection between education and production.

　　During the discussion, the conference believed that currently, under the general task of cultivating students' communist outlook on life and moral character, and making them talents for the all-round development of socialist society, emphasis should be placed on cultivating students' spirit of hard struggle and strengthening labor education and discipline education. The content of political and ideological education should be closely combined with the current political tasks of the country and the students' ideological reality. Education on current events and policies should be regularized. Teaching and political and ideological education must be closely integrated, and both classroom and extracurricular education methods should not be neglected.

　　The conference also discussed the revision of the teaching plans for primary and secondary schools and teacher training schools for the 1957-1958 academic year, with the aim of appropriately reducing students' learning burden and improving teaching quality. The conference believed that some minor subjects should be cut, basic subjects should be strengthened, and some necessary subjects should be added. For example, in the teaching plans of middle schools, subjects such as Chinese language, mathematics, physical education, and politics must be guaranteed to be well learned. Political courses should also be universally added from the first year of junior high school to the third year of senior high school. Rural junior high schools will consider adding a course on basic agricultural knowledge. The total number of class hours will be appropriately reduced to increase students' self-study time. Subjects such as literature and physics in senior high schools can be appropriately streamlined. The conference also particularly emphasized that localities are allowed to have flexibility in implementing teaching plans.

　　全国教育行政会议闭幕
　　着重讨论了今年教育事业的安排
　  认为政治思想教育是学校教育的灵魂
    新华社28日讯  第三次全国教育行政会议18日到28日在北京举行。会议着重讨论了1957年教育事业的安排，各级学校加强政治思想教育问题，中小学和师范学校教学计划的安排问题。
    会议认为，去年教育事业的发展多少超过了可能条件，师资、设备、基本建设等都赶不上发展的要求。今年的教育事业的发展必须放在充分可靠的基础上。根据国家的人力、物力、财力的条件，在保证一定质量的原则下，作适当的发展。
    会议认为，小学教育的发展必须打破由国家包下来的思想，在城市里，要提倡街道、机关、厂矿企业办学；在农村，要提倡群众集体办学。私人办学可以允许，但不提倡。这些学校办起来以后，学校的行政管理可以由家长中选出的董事会来负责，教育行政部门给予监督和指导。总之，是多办学校比少办学校好，能识字比不识字好。
    会议认为，中学的设置今后应适当分散，改变过去规模过大、过分集中在城市的缺点。特别是初中的发展，今后要面向农村。去年办了很多“戴帽子”学校（一部分完全小学增设初中班），这部分学校不要轻易调整或合并，要根据当地条件来决定分或合。需要调整时，要和当地群众商量，取得群众同意。但是，要防止因保留“戴帽子”而挤垮了小学。会议强调农村中学主要是给青年以必需的基本知识，在小学教育的基础上提高一步，使他们在毕业以后能更好地参加生产。因此，农村初中在教学质量上不能强求和城市一律。
    会议认为，政治思想教育是学校教育的灵魂。目前普通教育存在着脱离实际的倾向，表现为教育和政治结合不够；教育和生产脱节。
    会议在讨论中认为，当前应该在培养学生的共产主义人生观和道德品质，使他们成为社会主义社会全面发展的人材这个总任务下，着重培养学生艰苦奋斗的精神，加强劳动教育和纪律教育。政治思想教育的内容，要密切结合当前国家的政治任务和学生的思想实际。时事政策教育要经常化。教学和政治思想教育必须密切结合，课内和课外教育的方式，两者不可偏废。
    会议还讨论了1957—1958学年度中小学、师范学校教学计划的修订问题，目的是适当减轻学生的学习负担，以提高教学质量。会议认为，要削减一些次要科目，加强基本科目，增加一些必要科目。如中学的教学计划中，语文、数学、体育、政治等科必须保证学好。从初中一年级到高中三年级还要普遍增设政治课。农村初中将考虑增设农业基础知识科。整个授课时数将适当减少，以增加学生的自学时间。高中的文学、物理等科，可以适当精简。会议还特别强调各地在执行教学计划时，允许有灵活性。
