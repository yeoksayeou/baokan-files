I fully agree with and support Chairman Mao's report at the Supreme State Conference, Premier Zhou Enlai's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries, and Vice-Chairman Chen Shutong's report. Now, I will report to you on the flood situation in Hebei Province last year, which everyone is concerned about, and the production and disaster relief work since the disaster.

Last summer, due to the impact of typhoons, Hebei Province experienced continuous heavy rainfall. On both sides of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, the general rainfall reached 300-500 millimeters, especially in the western mountainous areas, where the rainfall was the highest, reaching over 800 millimeters in some places, and it was all concentrated in late July and early August. As a result, all rivers between the Juma River in the north and the Zhang and Wei Rivers in the south simultaneously experienced extraordinary floods, some of which were unprecedented in decades, or even one or two hundred years. Although all localities mobilized their full strength and engaged in intensive dike protection and emergency rescue, the floods greatly exceeded the capacity of the river channels and the defensive capacity of the dikes, resulting in continuous breaches and overflows of the rivers, with floods raging and forming the most serious flood disaster since liberation. A total of 45 million mu of farmland in the province were flooded, affecting a population of 15 million people. Because the floods were too large, too fierce, and concentrated in cotton and grain producing areas, not only were agricultural crops greatly reduced, but also houses collapsed and property losses were very serious. It is estimated that the province's grain production was reduced by about 5 billion jin, and cotton production was reduced by about 300 million jin due to the disaster; about 2.6 million houses collapsed due to the disaster, and many villages were devastated.

The Affected Farmers Have Victoriously Overcome the Winter Famine

During the period of the floods, under the leadership of Party and government at all levels, a total of more than 1.5 million cadres, local workers, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the province were involved in flood prevention and emergency rescue. Due to their high degree of hard work and dedication, they guarded and rescued day and night, and finally defended the safety of Tianjin City and the Jinpu and Jingshan Railways, and reduced the affected area downstream. At the same time, they also used great strength to carry out the struggle to rescue people's lives and property. Many cadres and soldiers risked their lives to rescue the victims from trees, water, and from collapsing houses. In order to deliver the daily necessities urgently needed by the victims quickly and effectively, where all means of transportation could not be used, they were carried on people's backs and shoulders. Many necessities were personally delivered to the victims by cadres wading through water. At that time, the central government and the province allocated a total of 11.5 million yuan in emergency relief funds, which promptly solved the difficulties in the lives of the victims.

After the floods, with the strong concern and support of the central government, fraternal provinces and cities, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and through a series of effective measures taken by Party and government leaders at all levels, a magnificent production self-salvation movement was quickly launched in the disaster areas. Now, it can be reported to you that, thanks to the active efforts of the vast number of victims and the results of saving and overcoming the famine, the affected farmers in Hebei Province have victoriously overcome the winter famine. Here, please allow me to express my heartfelt thanks to the central government, fraternal provinces and cities, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army for their concern and support for the people of our province. At present, the people of our province are making great efforts to overcome the spring famine and strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

Agricultural Cooperatives Have Played an Unparalleled Superiority in Disaster Relief

Through a recent period of work, we have deeply realized that advanced agricultural production cooperatives have played an unparalleled superiority in the production self-salvation movement. In the early stages of the disaster, some people doubted whether advanced cooperatives could lead the victims through the famine, and there was a period of chaos in some disaster areas. Some cooperative members thought that "socialism was washed away by the flood," and some cooperative cadres even proposed the idea of "eight immortals crossing the sea, each showing their own skills." However, these understandings were quickly negated by the facts. Looking back, before the advanced agricultural cooperativization, each flood often made many people bankrupt and homeless, while others took advantage of the disaster to make a fortune. Everyone knows that famine years are the easiest years for class differentiation to occur. Not only was this the case before liberation, but after liberation, even though the state provided strong support to farmers, class differentiation still occurred. However, because advanced agricultural cooperativization was realized last year, and the collective ownership of major means of production was implemented, the situation was greatly different. Now, no one can take advantage of the famine to exploit others, and some farmers who have difficulties can rely on the collective strength of agricultural cooperatives to avoid living in poverty. Therefore, although the disaster situation in Hebei Province last year exceeded that of 1954, the production and life of the masses were very stable. For example, the Xinqiao Agricultural Cooperative in Wen'an County, which suffered a heavy disaster, could distribute more than 3 jiao per person per day from its sideline income after the disaster, in addition to leaving an appropriate amount of accumulation. Based on a consumption of 1 jiao 5 fen per person per day, there was still a surplus of one-half in addition to maintaining life. In 1939, the village suffered a similar disaster, but at that time, 429 out of 542 households in the village sold their property, 327 households fled the famine, and some people died of cold and starvation. Last winter, all the affected agricultural cooperatives in our province launched sideline and handicraft production. From after the disaster to the end of last year, the income from sideline production in the disaster areas of the province reached 130 million yuan, with an average monthly income of 33 million yuan. In 1954, nearly 40 million mu of land were flooded in the province. At that time, because many cooperatives were elementary cooperatives and there were still many individual households, sideline production was not as good as last year, with an average monthly income of only 14.6 million yuan. All of this fully shows that after advanced agricultural cooperativization, not only can labor be unifiedly allocated to ensure the simultaneous progress of various productions; but also the talents, tools, and funds in the cooperative can be used in a unified way to maximize their effectiveness; because advanced cooperatives link everyone's interests together, it facilitates the mutual transmission of production technology. All of these are incomparable to individual farmers, mutual aid groups, and elementary cooperatives. Countless examples have also proved this point. Despite the superiority of the agricultural production cooperative system, if we do not use these superiorities, the superiorities will not spontaneously manifest themselves, and even if the work is not done well, it will affect production and cooperative members' income. Therefore, after the disaster, we have always emphasized relying on agricultural cooperatives to do a good job in production and disaster relief, and strengthened political and ideological education and political and ideological leadership for agricultural cooperatives. If we have achieved certain results in disaster relief work, then relying on agricultural cooperatives to carry out work should be one of the main reasons for achieving results.

Developing a variety of sideline productions in the disaster areas is an effective way to solve the practical difficulties of the victims. Grasping the new contradictions arising in the cooperatives after the disaster, and giving full play to the positive factors within the cooperatives, is the basic key to the success of sideline production. After the disaster last year, we emphasized that, in the spirit of benefiting the enthusiasm of cooperative members for production and facilitating the combination of agricultural and sideline productions, we should make unified plans according to the conditions of the cooperatives. In terms of the division of labor in sideline operations, in general, those that require large investments, many people, and are conducive to collective production are operated by the cooperative or production team; those that do not require investment or require little investment and are suitable for decentralized individual operation are operated by individual cooperative members. In terms of work points for sideline production, we firmly grasp the principles of "payment according to labor, equal pay for equal work, and more pay for more work." The specific methods are diverse, and are formulated according to the characteristics of various sideline productions. Where it is possible to set work quotas, the quota contracting system is implemented, with bonuses for exceeding the quota; where it is possible to count by piece, work points are recorded by piece; where it is neither possible to count by piece nor set quotas, work points are recorded by day. In terms of the distribution of sideline income, we follow the policy of "less deduction and more distribution," first solving the living difficulties of cooperative members, and at the same time establishing a short-term pre-distribution system to stimulate the enthusiasm of cooperative members for production. Through the above measures, we have effectively overcome and prevented the occurrence of various biases that attach importance to collective interests and ignore the personal interests of cooperative members, or only attach importance to the personal interests of cooperative members and ignore collective interests, and correctly solved the various new contradictions arising in the cooperatives after the disaster. This is the key to whether cooperatives can carry out a variety of sideline productions.

Developing production for self-salvation is the main aspect of leading the victims to overcome the famine. At the same time, in order to promote production for self-salvation in the disaster areas and encourage the victims' confidence in overcoming the famine, the state also distributed a large amount of relief funds to provide assistance to those households with more people and less labor or the disabled, elderly, widowed, and orphaned who had difficulties in life, and helped the victims repair more than 922,000 collapsed houses, enabling them to restore production and rebuild their homes. At present, all affected areas are distributing spring relief funds according to the living conditions of the masses. In the method of distributing relief funds, all localities have adopted the method of "combining leadership mastery with democratic appraisal," and generally achieve timely distribution and reasonable use. Some areas have also created the method of "fixed labor production and fixed quota relief." That is, on the basis of studying and formulating production plans by the agricultural cooperative and its members, the number of workdays and production income of the members are determined, plus the members' other reliable income, as the members' total income, and then the household's living expenses are calculated, and the insufficient part is given a loan or relief according to the situation. Wherever this is done, the scope of relief is small, accurate and reasonable, the masses are satisfied, the enthusiasm for production is high, and at the same time, the shortcomings of the victims' dependence, waste, and the embezzlement and over-occupation of a few cadres can be overcome. This is a good way to combine relief distribution with organizing production, and we are preparing to further promote it throughout the province.

Hebei Province is a province with many rivers. To completely eliminate natural disasters, it is necessary to fundamentally manage the rivers of the Haihe River system. Relevant departments have already begun to carry out a comprehensive plan for the fundamental treatment of the Haihe River basin. The proposal for the development of the national economy in the second five-year plan also includes this project. The great event that the people of Hebei Province have been looking forward to for hundreds of years will be gradually realized, and the people of the whole province will be jubilant for this. However, this project is very large and cannot be completed in a short period of time. Therefore, at the current stage, it is still necessary to adopt the policy of combining disaster prevention and disaster relief, and to find ways to reduce and avoid the losses of natural disasters from many aspects. In this regard, we have held work-for-relief projects in the past winter and this spring in conjunction with dike restoration and road repair, on the one hand, to strengthen river embankments and road foundations, and on the other hand, to increase the income of the victims. In low-lying and flood-prone areas, we will carry out production and planting reforms, leading farmers to plant more early-maturing crops and flood-resistant crops; in areas suitable for wheat planting, we will plant a large amount of wheat and strive for a bumper harvest in the wheat season. In the plains, we will continue to build ditches and furrowed fields to prevent drought and waterlogging, and in the mountainous areas, we will build water and soil conservation projects and small reservoirs. In short, while systematically carrying out the fundamental treatment of the Haihe River project, we must strengthen river management and flood prevention, and mobilize the masses to carry out small-scale water conservancy projects in accordance with local conditions, and fight against natural water disasters in accordance with the policy of combining symptomatic treatment and fundamental treatment.

Rely on Agricultural Cooperatives to Deeply Carry Out Production Self-Salvation Movement

The production self-salvation movement is a mass movement of millions of victims fighting for production and life. Therefore, leading this movement must implement the working method of the mass line, rely on cooperatives, go deep into the masses, go deep into reality, and strengthen inspection. In addition to regular inspections, the leading organs at all levels in the disaster areas have also organized planned general inspections during seasonal changes such as freezing, Spring Festival, and thawing, so as to grasp the development and changes of the disaster situation at any time, discover problems, and solve problems. In particular, we must grasp ideological leadership. We must prevent and correct the two harmful emotions of pessimism and disappointment and blind optimism among the masses; we must pay attention to overcoming the slack and paralysis of thought and the fear of difficulties among cadres. This is the ideological guarantee for overcoming the disaster.

However, there are also some shortcomings and problems in the production and disaster relief work in Hebei Province. First of all, due to insufficient ideological education, some farmers have developed the idea of liking industry and disliking agriculture, coupled with some misunderstandings about the relationship between workers and peasants. Therefore, the number of farmers flowing to cities and new factory and mining bases has recently increased. This not only adds a lot of burden to neighboring areas, but also seriously affects spring plowing and production. Secondly, some places lack the enthusiasm for saving and overcoming the famine, and many victims still have the idea of relying on relief and not saving on production. In some places, the relief funds are distributed too widely and in too large amounts, which has also fueled this emotion. Thirdly, due to the lack of fodder, livestock in the disaster areas once became very weak and died in large numbers. Although there has been a reversal, it has not completely stopped. What should be particularly pointed out is that the spring famine season has now arrived, and many signs indicate that the spring famine is developing in a serious direction. Everyone knows that disasters are afraid of the tail and not the head. Spring is the most difficult time for the victims, and it is also the most critical time for disaster relief work. According to the survey, about 90% of the people in severely affected areas lack food and must be solved through production and state relief. After the start of spring plowing, agricultural production requires a large number of labor forces, and the victims must also engage in necessary sideline production to survive. The contradiction between agricultural and sideline production must be properly resolved. This shows that our spring production and disaster relief tasks are still extremely arduous. We are taking active measures to further carry out production self-salvation and saving and overcoming the famine movement, and call on the people of the province, especially the cadres, to take the lead, on the basis of saving two jin of grain every month, to mix in a part of substitute food, so as to save more grain to overcome the severe spring famine. As I said before, spring is the most urgent time for disaster relief in our province, and we still need the central government and all parties to continue to give sympathy and support, especially the supply of grain, substitute food, and raw materials for sideline production. We believe that under the correct leadership of the central government and the strong support of all parties, continuing to lead the masses to overcome the spring famine and strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year is still fully conditional and has sufficient confidence.

The above opinions, whether appropriate, please criticize and correct. (Attached image)

　　战胜春荒　争取今年大丰收
　　刘洪涛谈河北省生产救灾工作
    我完全同意并且拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上的报告、周恩来总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告及陈叔通副主席的报告。现在我把大家都关心的河北省去年的水灾情况和受灾以来的生产救灾工作向大家报告一下。
    去年夏季，由于台风影响，河北省连降大雨。在京汉铁路两侧，一般雨量达三百——五百公厘，特别是西部山区雨量最大，有的达到八百多公厘，而且都集中在7月下旬和8月初。因之，北起拒马河，南至漳、卫河之间所有各河，都同时暴发了几十年来甚至有的是一、二百年来所未有的特大洪水。虽经各地全力动员，紧张护堤抢险，但由于洪水大大超过了河道容泄能力和河堤的防御能力，以致各河流连续决口、漫溢，洪水横流，形成了解放以来最严重的水灾。全省被淹耕地共达四千五百万亩，受灾人口一千五百万人。由于洪水过大、过猛，并集中在棉粮产区，所以不仅农作物大量减产，而且房屋倒塌，财产损失也是非常严重的。全省约计因灾减产粮食五十亿斤左右，减产棉花三亿斤左右；因灾倒房二百六十余万间，不少村庄形成了毁灭性的灾害。
    受灾农民已胜利度过冬荒
    洪水暴发时期，在各级党政领导下，全省投入防汛、抢险的各级干部、各地民工和人民解放军驻军官兵共达一百五十余万人。由于他们高度发扬了艰苦奋斗精神，日以继夜地坚守抢护，最后终于保卫了天津市和津浦、京山两条铁路的安全，并减缩了下游的受灾面积。与此同时，还以巨大的力量进行了抢救人民生命、财产的斗争。许多干部和战士冒着生命危险，从树上、水里、从即将倒塌的房屋中把灾民抢救出来。为了把灾民急需的生活资料迅速有效地送到灾民手里，在一切运输工具都不能使用的地方，就用人背，肩担。有很多生活必需品是干部涉水亲自送给灾民的。当时，中央和本省共拨出急赈款一千一百五十万元，及时地解决了灾民生活上的困难。
    水灾形成以后，在中央、兄弟省、市和中国人民解放军的大力关怀、支持下，经过各级党政领导采取一系列的有效措施，受灾地区很快地开展起来一个规模壮阔的生产自救运动。现在可以告慰大家，由于广大灾民的积极努力、节约度荒的结果，河北省受灾农民，已经胜利地度过了冬荒。在这里，请允许我对中央、各兄弟省、市和中国人民解放军所给予我省人民的关怀和支持表示衷心的感谢。当前我省人民正在为战胜春荒，争取今年农业全面大丰收而做着巨大的努力。
    农业社在救灾中发挥了无比的优越性
    通过近来一个时期的工作，我们深深的体会到，高级农业生产合作社在生产自救运动中，发挥了无比的优越性。受灾初期，有些人对高级社能否领导灾民度过灾荒抱有怀疑，一部分灾区也曾一度出现了混乱局面，有的社员认为“社会主义被大水冲散了”，有的社干部也曾因此提出过“八仙过海，各显其能”的论调，但是，这些认识很快就为事实所否定。回想在农业高级合作化以前，每次水灾往往使许多人倾家荡产流离失所，而另外一些人则乘人之危大发横财。大家知道，灾荒年头是最容易发生阶级分化的年头，不仅解放前是这样，解放后国家虽对农民大力扶助，也曾出现阶级分化的现象。但是由于去年实现了高级农业合作化，实行了主要生产资料的集体所有制，情况就大大地不同了，现在再没有人利用灾荒年景乘人之危而对别人进行剥削的可能了，而某些有困难的农民，则可以依靠农业社的集体力量，不至于生活无着。所以，去年河北省的灾情虽然超过了1954年，而群众的生产和生活却是很稳定的。例如，遭受重灾的文安县新桥农业社受灾以后，副业收入除留下适当的积累以外，每人每天还可分三角多钱，按每人每天消费一角五分计算，除维持生活外，还可剩余二分之一。1939年这个村同样受了重灾，但是那时全村五百四十二户中就有四百二十九户变卖家产，有三百二十七户外出逃荒，还有人被冻饿而死。去年冬季，我省所有受灾的农业社都开展了副业、手工业生产，从灾后到去年年底，全省灾区副业生产收入达一万三千万元，平均每月收入三千三百万元。1954年全省淹地近四千万亩，当时由于很多社都是初级社，单干户还很多，副业生产就不如去年，每月平均只收入一千四百六十万元。所有这些充分地说明了农业高级合作化后，不仅可以统一支配劳力，保证各种生产的同时进行；而且社里的人材、工具和资金统一使用，就可以发挥其最大效能；由于高级社把大家的利益联结在一起，便利了生产技术的相互传授。所有这些，都是单干农民、互助组和初级社所不可比拟的。无数事例也证明了这一点。尽管农业生产合作社制度这样优越，但是如果我们不去利用这些优越性，优越性也不会自发地显示出来，甚至如果工作做不好，还会使生产和社员收入受到影响。因此，受灾以后，我们始终强调了依靠农业社做好生产救灾工作，加强了对农业社的政治思想教育和政治思想领导。如果说我们在救灾工作上有一定成绩，那么，依靠农业社进行工作，应当是取得成绩的主要原因之一。
    在灾区开展多种多样副业生产，是解决灾民现实困难的有效办法，抓住合作社灾后产生的新的矛盾，充分发挥合作社内部的积极因素，又是副业生产开展好坏的基本关键。去年灾后，我们强调了本着有利发挥社员生产积极性和便于农副业相结合的精神，因社制宜地统一规划。在副业经营分工方面，一般的说，投资大，用人多，利于集体生产的，由社或生产队经营；不用投资或投资少，适合分散个体经营的，由社员个人经营。在副业记工方面，紧紧掌握着“按劳取酬，同工同酬，多劳多得”的原则。具体办法是多种多样的，根据各种副业的特点而订。能够制定工作定额的，实行定额包工，超额奖励；能够计件的，采用按件记工；既不能按件又不能定额的，采用按天记工。在副业收益分配方面，遵循着“少扣多分”的方针，首先解决社员的生活困难，同时建立短期的预分制度，启发社员的生产积极性。通过上述措施，有效地克服和防止了重视集体利益忽视社员个人利益，或只重视社员个人利益而忽视集体利益的各种偏向的发生，正确地解决合作社灾后所产生的各种新的矛盾，是合作社能否搞起多种多样副业生产的关键问题。
    开展生产自救，是领导灾民度荒的主要方面。与此同时，为了推动灾区的生产自救，鼓舞灾民的度荒信心，国家还发放了大批救济款，对那些人多劳力少或残老孤寡户的生活困难，加以救济，并帮助灾民修盖了倒塌的房屋九十二万二千多间，使他们恢复生产，重建家园。现在，各受灾地区正在根据群众的生活情况，发放春季救济款。在救济款的发放方法上，各地都采用了“领导掌握与民主评议相结合”的方法，一般做到了发放及时，使用合理。有的地区，还创造了“定工生产、定额救济”的方法。就是在农业社与社员研究制定生产规划的基础上，确定社员出工数和生产收入数，加上社员其他可靠收入，作为社员的全部收入，然后再计算每户的生活开支，不足部分，根据情况给予贷款或救济。凡是这样作的地方，救济面小，准确合理，群众满意，生产情绪高涨，同时能克服灾民依赖、浪费和少数干部贪污、多占的缺点。这是发放救济与组织生产相结合的好办法，我们准备在全省范围内进一步推广。
    河北省是一个多河的省份，打算彻底消灭自然灾害必须对海河系各河进行根本治理，有关部门已在着手进行根治海河流域的全面规划，关于发展国民经济第二个五年计划的建议里面也列入了这一个项目，河北人民数百年来盼望的大事情，将要逐步得到实现，全省人民都将为此欢欣鼓舞。但是这一工程十分浩大，并不是短期内所能办到。因此，在当前阶段，还必须采取防灾与救灾相结合的方针，要从多方面设法减少与避免自然灾害的损失。在这方面，我们在去冬和今春结合复堤、修路举办了以工代赈工程，一方面加固河防堤岸和公路路基，一方面增加灾民收入。在低洼易涝地区进行生产和种植改革，领导农民多种早熟作物、耐涝作物；适于种麦地区，大量种植小麦，争取麦季丰收。在平原地区继续修筑沟洫畦田，防旱防涝，山区兴修水土保持和小型水库。总之，在有计划地进行根治海河工程的同时，加强治河防汛，并要发动群众，因地制宜地举办小型水利，根据治标与治本相结合的方针，同自然水患进行斗争。
    依靠农业社，深入开展生产自救运动
    生产自救运动是千百万灾民为生产生活而斗争的群众运动，因之，领导这个运动必须贯彻群众路线的工作方法，依靠合作社，深入群众，深入实际，加强检查。灾区的各级领导机关，除了随时检查以外，在封冻、春节、化冻等季节变化时期，还有计划地组织了普遍检查，作到随时掌握灾情的发展变化，发现问题，解决问题。特别是抓住思想领导。在群众中防止与纠正悲观失望和盲目乐观两种有害情绪；在干部中注意克服松懈麻痹思想和畏难情绪，又是战胜灾荒的思想保证。
    但是，河北省的生产救灾工作，也发生与存在着某些缺点和问题。首先是有部分农民由于思想教育不足，滋长了喜工厌农思想，加之对工农关系的一些误解，所以最近外流到城市和新建厂矿基地去的农民有所增加，这不仅给友邻地区增加了许多负担，并且严重地影响着春耕生产。其次，有些地方节约度荒的劲头不足，不少灾民尚有依赖救济和生产不节约的思想，有些地方的救济款发放得面宽了一些，量大了一些，也助长了这种情绪。第三，由于饲草缺乏，灾区牲畜曾一度大量瘦弱、死亡，现在虽有扭转，但仍未完全停止。特别应当提出的是，目前春荒季节已到，许多迹象表明，春荒有向严重方面发展的趋势，大家知道，灾荒是怕尾不怕头的，春季是灾民最困难时期，也是救灾工作最紧要的关头。据调查，严重灾区有90％左右的人缺粮，必须通过生产和国家救济来解决。春耕开始以后，农业生产需用大批劳力，而灾民又必须从事必要的副业生产赖以生活，农副业生产的矛盾必须妥善解决。这就说明，我们春季的生产救灾任务还是异常艰巨的。我们正在采取积极措施，进一步开展生产自救、节约度荒运动，并且号召全省人民，首先是干部带头，在每月已经节约二斤粮食的情况下，再掺食一部分代食品，以便节省更多一点粮食，来度过严重的春荒。正如我前面所说，春季是我省救灾最紧急的关头，还需要中央和各方面继续给以同情与支援，尤其是粮食、代食品、副业生产原料的供应。我们相信，在中央正确领导和各方面的大力支援下，继续领导群众战胜春荒，争取今年农业大丰收还是有充分的条件和足够的信心的。
    以上意见，是否有当，敬请批评指正。（附图片）
