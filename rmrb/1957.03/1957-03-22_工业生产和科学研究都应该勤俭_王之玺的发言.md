I fully endorse Chairman Mao's instructions at the enlarged Supreme State Conference and Premier Zhou's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries, and I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Chen Yun and Li Fuchun, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and President Dong Biwu.

Now, please allow me to express some opinions on the two issues of increasing production and practicing economy, and scientific research:

(1) Increasing production and practicing economy, as Chairman Mao said, is like washing our faces every day; it is a regular task in our socialist construction and a long-term task. In order to expand socialist accumulation, develop the socialist economy, and accelerate the country's industrialization, increasing production and practicing economy is a fundamental method. Vice Premier Chen Yun has already made a special speech on how various economic sectors and administrative management agencies across the country should increase production and practice economy in 1957. I would like to focus on several key issues in developing increasing production and practicing economy in the industrial sector.

Regarding the issue of increasing production and practicing economy:

This year, the two main aspects of industrial production increase are: promoting new technologies and overcoming weak links. The focus of production increase should be on raw material production departments. Savings can focus on coking coal, pig iron, and steel.

First, let's talk about increasing production. In the seven years since liberation, various industries in our country have been rapidly restored and developed. In the process of development, the growth of production has, of course, relied on the construction and renovation of factories; however, a significant portion of the production increase has relied on the continuous promotion of many new technologies and advanced experiences in enterprises, and on some renovations of the equipment of old enterprises, overcoming weak links, and improving production. For example, in the aspect of iron smelting, a series of advanced technologies such as raw material preparation, furnace top regulation, increasing wind temperature, and humidifying blast have been implemented in recent years, enabling our current blast furnace output to exceed the design capacity by more than double, and the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces has approached the world's advanced level. Furthermore, in overcoming weak links, the output of some of our rolling mills has greatly increased after replacing motors or adding heating and finishing equipment. The above illustrates our two main measures for increasing production in the past. Some people say that the potential of our enterprises has now been almost fully tapped, the level of production is not low, and the Soviet Union's new technologies that can be implemented under the existing equipment conditions have been implemented, and the capacity of the equipment has also been basically fully utilized. It seems that there is no potential to be tapped in production. I think this view is wrong. Production is constantly developing, and new technologies and advanced experiences will always emerge with the development of production; the renovation of old equipment is also the same. After a weak link is overcome, new weak links will appear. In the continuous overcoming of weak links, production capacity will also be continuously improved. Therefore, I believe that in 1957, the industrial production increase should focus on the two main aspects of promoting new technologies and overcoming weak links. As for the focus of production increase, I think it should be placed on raw material production departments, especially coal, ore, coking coal, pig iron, etc., because the increase in the production of these raw materials will create conditions for the increase in steel production; the increase in the production of basic means of production such as pig iron, steel, wood, and cement will ensure the completion of capital construction and production plans.

Secondly, is the issue of conservation: the issue of conservation in industry is mainly the conservation of means of production. According to Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech, the materials in short supply are mainly pig iron, steel, wood, cement, etc. I will only talk about the conservation of coking coal, pig iron, steel, and alloy element nickel in the metallurgical industry. (1) Coking coal is mainly consumed in iron smelting, and it is also used in casting, forging, gas, burning lime dolomite, etc. Among them, except for metallurgical coke that must be used in iron smelting and casting, other aspects can partially or completely switch to using low-quality coke (gas coke, semi-coke produced by oil refining, etc.) and anthracite when metallurgical coke is lacking; if low-quality coke and anthracite can be fully supplied, we have the potential to save 50,000 to 100,000 tons of coking coal. The consumption of coking coal in iron smelting and casting can also be reduced, especially in iron smelting. If we can further increase the basicity of sintered ore and appropriately adjust the wind temperature and blast humidity under the condition of ensuring smooth operation of the blast furnace, the coking coal consumption of iron smelting has the potential to be reduced (although the ore conditions are poor this year); if the coking coal consumption is reduced by 20 to 30 kilograms per ton of pig iron, the country can save more than 100,000 tons of coking coal this year. (2) Pig iron is mainly used for steelmaking and casting. In steelmaking, we should strive to improve operations and reduce the metal consumption per ton of steel, especially converter steel, which has a high blowing loss. If the metal consumption can be reduced by 10 to 20 kilograms per ton of steel on average, more than 50,000 tons of pig iron can be saved this year. There is also the possibility of saving iron for casting. The annual consumption of pig iron for casting in the Soviet Union and capitalist countries accounts for about 10% of the total pig iron production. In our country, the output of cast iron in 1957 accounted for about 25% of the total pig iron production. Although the specific situation in our country may be different from other countries; however, I think that if we can analyze it in detail, the possibility of saving pig iron in this aspect is still very large. (3) Steel saving mainly has two aspects: first, reducing the scope of steel use, and using other materials instead wherever possible. For example, factories now try to use steel structures in the design of factory buildings, but factories without heavy-duty cranes can completely use concrete structures instead, and even some can use wood structures instead; unfortunately, some departments not only do not restrict the use of steel, but also use steel instead of other materials. For example, metal supports are being studied for use in mine tunnels, and other aspects that did not use steel in the past are also changing to using steel in large quantities; therefore, strictly restricting the use of steel and using substitutes as much as possible is one of the important ways to save steel currently. The second is the widespread use of high-strength low-alloy steel. In recent years, deformed steel bars have been used on concrete, saving more than 20% of steel. This year, high-strength silicon-manganese steel bars are being promoted, which will save more than 20% compared to deformed steel bars. This high-strength low-alloy steel is actually not only limited to steel bars, but can also be tried on section steel and plate steel. If the use can be expanded, more steel can be saved. (4) Alloy element nickel is the most widely used element in our alloy steel, and it is also an important metal that our country lacks the most. The supply has been relying on imports for many years. With the growth of alloy steel production and the development of related industries, the supply of nickel is extremely tight. In 1957, the production of alloy steel and important materials such as electronic tubes was affected due to the insufficient supply of nickel; in order to solve this problem, using existing foreign experience, the research and trial production of alloy structural steel to replace nickel is being carried out to save nickel consumption, so that the available nickel can be used in the most needed heat-resistant stainless steel and important electrical manufacturing departments, which is a major issue in conservation.

In short, increasing production and practicing economy is a primary task in our industrial production. If we can mobilize the broad masses of workers and staff and take all possible measures, the difficulties we encounter in the course of advancement today can definitely be solved smoothly.

Regarding scientific research:

What is important is the issue of combining scientific research work with production practice. Research work should solve practical problems and promote industry. It is necessary to run science frugally and seriously correct wasteful phenomena.

(2) Scientific research. Since the Party Central Committee advocated strengthening scientific research work last year, under the leadership of the State Council's Science Planning Commission, and with the help of Soviet experts, it organized senior scientific workers across the country to compile a twelve-year long-term development plan for science and technology. In the past year, scientific research institutions have increased rapidly, the strength of scientific research has been greatly enriched, scientific workers have also played a high degree of enthusiasm, and scientific research work has been rapidly developed, and the achievements are great; however, the development of scientific research work is not without problems. The first is the issue of combining scientific research work with production practice. This issue seems to be an old topic; however, it has not been completely resolved in the minds of scientific workers to this day. Some people think that theoretical issues are the foundation, and research work only makes theoretical explorations and does not touch reality; some people say from the perspective of division of labor that practical problems should be solved by production enterprises, and it is not the task of research departments; some people even think that the major technical problems to be solved in practice are not of great scientific significance and are unwilling to include them in research projects; in addition, some people are only satisfied with laboratory research and are indifferent to whether the results of laboratory research can be applied to practice. The above situations exist more or less in our research institutions. Therefore, although research work has been greatly developed in recent years; however, it has not produced the due effect in industrial production, which is worthy of our attention. I think that the purpose of applied scientific research should be to serve the solution of practical problems, especially in the current stage of socialist construction in our country. The research of theoretical problems should be to seek solutions to certain practical problems; and the solution of practical problems can often enrich the content of the theory, and the combination of the two can accelerate the development of science and also accelerate the progress of industry. This is also the case in fraternal countries. For example, in recent years, in order to use its own brown coal and lean iron ore for iron smelting, the German Democratic Republic organized scientific workers from all aspects, from the laboratory to the factory, from theory to practice, to carry out a series of research work. The success of this research work solved a major problem in the development of the German steel industry, and also represented the technical level of German scientific work. For example, in recent years, the Soviet Union has carried out a lot of research work on continuous casting and the use of oxygen in the metallurgical industry, and has achieved great achievements. The success of this research work provides new possibilities for the future construction of the Soviet metallurgical industry. In addition, scientific institutions and production plants and mines in the Soviet Union and other countries have close ties. Scientific researchers often go to the factory to work, and general industrial tests are carried out using factory equipment, which not only saves the investment in several large-scale test equipment, but also allows researchers to go deep into the site to understand the practical problems existing in production, which plays a huge role in combining research work with practice. Therefore, I think that research work is closely combined with national needs, solving practical problems; researchers often go to the site to understand production needs; is the key issue to improve the current scientific research work, and thoroughly solve this problem, scientific research work can truly serve industry, can truly promote the development of industry!

Secondly, is the issue of running science frugally. Since the Central Committee advocated strengthening scientific research work last year, the growth of scientific institutions has sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain. Some institutions have very few scientific researchers, and research work has not yet been established, so they first built magnificent research buildings; some institutions do not have personnel to lead research work, but they have recruited a large number of university students and senior vocational graduates, with no leader, and research work cannot be carried out, causing a waste of human resources; some scientific research institutions have also used foreign exchange to order a large number of equipment from abroad that can be solved domestically; some units have also ordered expensive equipment that they do not urgently need, and even they do not know how to use these equipment, causing a waste of material resources. Of course, scientific research work requires certain material conditions (buildings, instruments and equipment, books and materials, etc.) and human conditions; however, it does not mean that every research institution must first build high-rise buildings before research work can be carried out; the development of scientific research institutions is also gradual, not that every research institution can ignore the needs of the work and order a large number of expensive equipment that is not urgently needed, and accumulate a large number of young scientific researchers. Last year, a comrade from the Soviet Academy of Sciences said after seeing the Chinese research institutions: "Our research institutions consider personnel according to the building area approved by the state (more people and less housing); your research institutions are large, you can usually lock the doors and open them when you use them (less people and more housing)." This is a serious criticism. We know that many famous research institutions in European fraternal countries do not have large building areas and not many personnel; however, there are well-known researchers in their research institutions who have done a lot of research work of great significance, and therefore gained fame. The so-called "mountains are not high, but famous if there are immortals" is the truth. Now our Party Central Committee is calling on the whole country to practice strict economy, and the wasteful phenomena in scientific research work should also be seriously corrected. The construction of research institutions should be based on simplicity and practicality, which should not only avoid luxury, but also prevent excessive area; general equipment should be supplied domestically as much as possible. The expensive equipment that must be purchased from abroad can be borrowed from neighboring scientific research institutions or jointly purchased and used; newly established institutions should first train personnel and establish research work, and then formally establish the institute when conditions are ripe; the management personnel in research institutions should be greatly streamlined to save management expenses. Doing so can save a lot of manpower and material resources for the country and achieve the goal of running science frugally.

The above opinions may be one-sided and incorrect, and I hope that the members will give corrections. (Attached picture)

专栏：

    工业生产和科学研究都应该勤俭
　　王之玺的发言
    我完全拥护毛主席在扩大最高国务会议上的指示和周总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告，并且完全同意陈云、李富春副总理、陈叔通副主席和董必武院长的报告。
    现在请允许我就增产节约和科学研究两个问题发表一些意见：
    （一）增产节约，诚如毛主席所说，就像我们每天要洗脸一样，它是我们社会主义建设中一件经常的工作，也是一件长期的工作。为了扩大社会主义积累，发展社会主义经济，加速国家的工业化，增产节约是一项基本的方法。关于1957年全国各个经济部门和行政管理机构如何进行增产节约，陈云副总理已经作了专题发言，我想就工业方面开展增产节约的几个重点问题着重谈一谈。关于增产节约问题
    今年工业增产两个主要方面：推广新技术和克服薄弱环节。增产重点应是生产原料部门。节约可以侧重焦炭、生铁和钢材。
    首先谈增产问题，解放七年以来，我国各项工业得到了迅速的恢复与发展，在发展过程中生产的增长，固然一方面依靠工厂的新建与改建；但是相当大的一部分增产，依靠在企业中不断地推广了许多新技术和先进经验，和对旧企业的设备进行了若干改造，克服了薄弱环节，提高了生产。例如炼铁方面几年来推行了原料准备，炉顶调剂，提高风温，加湿鼓风等一系列的先进技术，使我们现在高炉的产量超过了设计能力的一倍以上，高炉的利用系数已经接近了世界先进的水平。又如在克服薄弱环节上，我们有些轧钢机在更换了马达或增加了加热和精整设备以后，产量大为提高。以上说明了我们过去增产上的两项主要措施。有人说我们企业的潜力现在已经挖的差不多了，生产的水平也不低了，苏联的新技术在现有设备的条件下能推行的都推行了，设备的能力也基本上充分发挥了，好像生产上已经没有潜力可挖了，这种看法我认为是错误的。生产是不断发展的，新的技术和先进经验永远随着生产的发展而不断出现；旧设备的改造也是如此，一个薄弱环节被克服以后，新的薄弱环节会出现，在不断地克服薄弱环节中，生产能力也就不断的提高。因此我认为1957年工业增产上应该抓住推广新技术与克服薄弱环节两个主要方面。至于增产上的重点，我认为应该放在原料生产部门，特别是煤炭、矿石、焦炭、生铁等，因为这些原料的增产，才能为钢材增产创造了条件；生铁、钢材、木材、水泥等基本生产资料的增产，才能保证基建和生产计划的完成。
    其次是节约问题：工业上的节约问题主要是生产资料的节约，根据陈云副总理的发言，供应紧张的物资主要是生铁、钢材、木材、水泥等，我只谈谈冶金工业中焦炭、生铁、钢材、合金元素镍的节约问题。（1）焦炭主要消耗在炼铁，此外还用在铸造、锻造、煤气、烧石灰白云石等。其中除去炼铁和铸造必须用冶金焦外，其他几方面在冶金焦缺乏的时候，都可以部分的或全部的改用劣质焦（煤气焦，炼油所产半焦等）和无烟煤；如果劣质焦和无烟煤能充分供应，我们完全有可能节省五万至十万吨焦炭。炼铁和铸造方面焦炭的消耗也可以降低，特别是炼铁方面，如果我们能够进一步提高烧结矿的碱度，在保证高炉顺行的条件下，适当的调整风温和鼓风湿度，炼铁的焦炭消耗有降低的可能（虽然今年矿石条件较差）；如果每吨生铁降低焦炭消耗二十至三十公斤，今年全国可以节省焦炭十万吨以上。（2）生铁主要用于炼钢和铸造，炼钢方面应该努力改进操作，降低每吨钢的金属消耗量，特别是转炉钢，吹损率很高，如果平均每吨钢能降低金属消耗十至二十公斤，今年可以节省生铁五万吨以上。铸造用铁方面也有节约的可能。苏联和资本主义国家每年消耗铸造用生铁占生铁总产量10％左右，我们1957年铸造铁的产量占生铁总产量25％左右，虽然我们国家的具体情况可能与其他国家不同；但是我认为如果能详细分析，这一方面节约生铁的可能性还是很大的。（3）钢材节约主要有两方面：第一缩小钢材使用范围，能够用其他材料代替的地方尽量代用。如工厂厂房现在设计上尽量采用钢质结构，实际没有重型起重机的厂房，完全可以混凝土结构来代替，甚至有些可以木质结构代替；遗憾的是有些部门不仅不限制钢材的用途，还用钢材代替其他材料，如矿山坑洞正在研究采用金属支柱，其他方面过去不使用钢材的地方，也在大量的改用钢材；所以严格限制钢材的用途，尽量采用代用品，是当前节约钢材重要途径之一。第二是广泛采用高强度低合金钢，近年来在混凝土上采用了螺纹钢筋，节约了钢材20％以上，今年正在推行高强度矽锰钢筋，比螺纹钢筋将更节省20％以上。这种高强度低合金钢实际不只限用于钢筋，在型钢和板钢上也可以试用，如能扩大用途，还可以节省更大量的钢材。（4）合金元素镍是我们合金钢方面使用最广的一种元素，也是我国最缺乏的一种重要金属，历年供应依靠进口来解决。随着合金钢生产的增长和相关工业的发展，镍的供应情况异常紧张，1957年因为镍的供应不足，影响合金钢及电子管等重要物资的生产；为了解决这一问题，利用国外已有的经验，研究代替镍的合金结构钢的试制与试用，以节约镍的消耗，使可能获得的镍用在最需要的耐热不锈钢和重要电气制造部门，是节约中一个重大问题。
    总之增产节约是我们工业生产上当前一项首要任务，如果我们能够发动广大职工群众，采取一切可能的措施，我们今天所遇到的前进中的困难，一定都可以顺利解决的。关于科学研究问题
    重要的是科学研究工作与生产实际相结合的问题，研究工作要解决实际问题，对工业起推动作用。要勤俭办科学，认真纠正浪费现象。
    （二）科学研究，自从去年党中央倡导加强科学研究工作以后，在国务院科学规划委员会的领导下，组织全国高级科学工作者，在苏联专家的帮助下编制了科学技术十二年长远发展规划。一年来科学研究的机构迅速增加，科学研究的力量大为充实，科学工作者也都发挥了高度的积极性，科学研究工作得到了迅速的发展，成绩是很大的；但是科学研究工作发展中也不是毫无问题的。首先是科学研究工作与生产实际的结合问题。这个问题好像是一个老生常谈的问题；但是一直到今天，在科学工作者的思想中还没有完全解决。有些人认为理论问题是基础，研究工作只作理论的探讨，不去接触实际；有些人从分工上讲，认为实际问题应由生产企业来解决，不是研究部门的任务；甚至还有些人认为实际中待解决的重大技术问题，科学意义不大，不愿列入研究项目；此外还有些人只满足于试验室的研究，对试验室研究的结果能否应用于实际漠不关心。以上这些情况在我们的研究机构中或多或少的存在。所以近年来研究工作虽然有了很大的发展；但在工业生产上没有产生应有的效果，这一点很值得我们注意。我认为应用科学研究的目的，应该是为解决实际问题服务，特别是在我国社会主义建设的现阶段。理论问题的研究应该是为了寻求解决某些实际问题；而实际问题的解决，常常又能丰富理论的内容，两者互相结合，才能加速科学的发展，同时也加速了工业的前进。这种情况在兄弟国家也是如此。例如民主德国近几年来为了利用本国的褐煤和贫铁矿炼铁，组织了各方面的科学工作者，从试验室到工厂，从理论到实际，进行了一系列的研究工作，这一研究工作的成功，解决了德国钢铁工业发展上一个重大问题，同时也代表了德国科学工作的技术水平。又如苏联近几年来对连续铸锭和在冶金工业上使用氧气问题进行了大量的研究工作，并且得到了很大的成就，这一研究工作的成功，对苏联冶金工业今后的建设提供了新的可能。此外苏德等国的科学机关与生产厂矿有密切连系，科学研究人员经常到现厂工作，一般工业性试验都利用工厂设备来进行，这样不仅可以节省若干大型试验设备的投资，同时研究人员深入现场，了解生产中存在的实际问题，对研究工作与实际相结合起着巨大的作用。因此我认为研究工作密切结合国家需要，解决实际问题；研究人员经常下现场，了解生产需要；是改进当前科学研究工作的关键问题，彻底的解决了这个问题，科学研究工作才能真正的为工业服务，才能真正对工业发展起了推动作用！
    其次是勤俭办科学问题。从去年中央提倡加强科学研究工作以后，科学机构的增长如雨后春笋，有的机构科学研究人员还很少，研究工作还没有建立，就首先建设了富丽堂皇的研究大楼；有的机构没有领导研究工作的人员，却招收了大量的大学生和高职毕业生，群龙无首，研究工作无法开展，造成了人力上的浪费；也有的科学研究机构利用外汇向国外定购了大量国内可以解决的设备；也有些单位定购了自己并不急需的贵重设备，甚至这些设备自己还不会使用，造成了物力上的浪费。当然进行科学研究工作需要一定的物质条件（建筑、仪器设备、图书资料等）和人力条件；但是并不是说每一个研究机构都必须先盖好高楼大厦，才能进行研究工作；科学研究机构的发展也是循序渐进的，并不是每一个研究机构可以不顾工作的需要，订购大量不急需的贵重设备，积压大量的青年科学研究人员。去年苏联科学院有一位同志看了中国的研究机构以后说：“我们的研究机关根据国家批准的建筑面积来考虑人员（人多房少）；你们的研究机关大，平时可以锁上门，用的时候再开它（人少房多）。”这是一个严正的批评。我们知道欧洲兄弟国家中许多有名的研究机构，确实建筑面积不大，人员也不多；但是他们研究机构中有知名的研究人员，做出了很多有重大意义的研究工作，因而得名。所谓“山不在高、有仙则名”，就是这个道理。现在我们党中央正号召全国厉行节约，科学研究工作方面的浪费现象，也应该认真的加以纠正。研究机构的建筑以朴实适用为主，既应避免豪华，也要防止面积过大；一般设备应尽量争取由国内供应，必须由国外购置的贵重设备，可以由邻近有关科学研究机构借用或共同购置使用；新成立的机构应首先培养人员，建立研究工作，俟条件成熟时再正式建所；研究机构中的管理人员应大力精简，以节约管理开支。这样做可以为国家节省大量的人力和物力，达到勤俭办科学的目的。
    以上的意见可能是片面的，不正确的，希望各位委员予以指正。（附图片）
