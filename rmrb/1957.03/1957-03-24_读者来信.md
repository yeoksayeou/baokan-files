　　Raising Pigs in Canteens Has Many Benefits

　　The Dashiba Coal Mine in Rongchang County, Sichuan Province, has 503 employees. Due to the national pork supply shortage, each person can generally only eat two or three taels of meat per serving. Later, our mine came up with the idea of raising our own pigs. We did the math: based on each person eating half a catty of meat per week, the entire mine of 503 people needs about 250 catties; based on this number, the entire mine needs to constantly keep 48 fattened pigs to be self-sufficient. The canteen produces about 2,500 catties of rice water and rice soup daily, and about 500 catties of vegetable peels and dishwater. If all of this is collected and stored, we only need to buy pig feed and chaff to solve the feed problem. These 48 pigs can produce 518,400 catties of fertilizer per year. According to the local farmers' habit of applying 500 catties of fertilizer per mu, this can fertilize 1,000 mu of land. Giving this fertilizer to the farmers is a strong support for agricultural production.

　　In short, raising pigs has many benefits; it truly "benefits the country and everyone." Now our mine has bought piglets according to the plan and hired a person specifically to raise pigs, using an abandoned straw shed, simply repairing it, and now we have a pigsty. In addition, the union has called on employees' families to raise at least one pig per household. Mo Ping

　　Currently, the national grain supply is tight, and farmers feel that there is not enough feed for raising pigs. However, there are many collective catering units in Fushun City, ranging from dozens to thousands of people. It is a pity that the greasy swill water flows away with the dirty water, which is equivalent to throwing away many fat pigs for nothing every year. If these units do not raise pigs themselves, it is best to collect the swill water and supply it to farmers to feed their pigs. These units can build a pool to store swill water, and for hygiene and cleanliness, a wooden board cover can be added to the pool opening. Farmers should also use wooden box-type carts to pull the swill water. This is a win-win situation, and I hope that catering units with the conditions can do this. Ma Zhongliang

　　The Catering Industry Can Use Waste to Raise Pigs

　　The catering industry needs a large amount of pork, and under the current situation of tight pork supply and demand nationwide, it often feels that the supply is insufficient. On the other hand, this industry has a large amount of swill water, starch slurry, tofu residue, and rotten vegetables that are not well utilized. Can the catering industry use these wastes to raise pigs? The experience of the catering industry in Hebei District and Heping District of Tianjin provides a positive answer.

　　The "Dong Ji" and "Chang Fa Xiang" two private noodle workshops in these two districts used to raise 23 pigs in the suburbs using noodle residue. After the joint state-private operation of the city's catering industry, the Hebei District and Heping District General Store of the Municipal Catering Industry Company expanded these two pig farms, raising 64 pigs. Several Chinese and Western restaurants, soybean milk shops, and noodle workshops in the district were designated to supply swill water, tofu residue, and starch slurry, which the pig farm would pull back daily to feed the pigs; in addition, a small amount of sugar lees, calcium carbonate, and red sorghum were added. The pigs grew very well on these feeds, and in more than half a year, they multiplied to 120.

　　Raising pigs in the catering industry is not only possible but also beneficial. According to the statistics of the pig farm's expenditures in December, at that time, raising 66 pigs cost a total of 148 yuan for feed, an average of 2.24 yuan per pig per month, totaling about 27 yuan per year. Adding the salaries of the breeders (calculated as 45 yuan per month for each breeder raising 30 pigs), as well as other miscellaneous expenses, the total cost per pig per year is 50 yuan. And each pig can gain 200 catties of weight per year, calculated at 0.43 yuan per catty according to the food company's purchase price, then one pig is worth 86 yuan. Therefore, each pig can make a profit of about 30 yuan per year.

　　Can the catering industry raise a large number of pigs? The Tianjin Municipal Catering Industry Company has also calculated this: the city's catering industry has about 10,000 catties of swill water, rotten vegetables, and starch slurry daily, and more than 100,000 catties of tofu residue, which can raise 17,000 pigs. Even if some of it is used for other purposes, it can still raise about 10,000 pigs, and slaughter several thousand heads a year. The city's catering industry only needs tens of thousands of pigs a year, so the number of self-raised pigs is indeed considerable.

　　In addition, I think that the fat pigs raised by the catering industry should basically be used by themselves, and some fat pigs that meet export standards can be sold to the food company on a voluntary basis. After the catering industry raises its own fat pigs, the food company can still supply the same amount of meat as originally planned, or reduce a portion appropriately, but the supply must not be stopped, so as to encourage them to raise pigs universally and in large quantities. The best way for the catering industry to raise pigs is to basically adopt the principle of self-breeding and self-raising, and only buy some piglets from the market for fattening when necessary, so as to prevent hog cholera. It can also continuously improve the breed of pigs and supply some piglets to farmers in the suburbs. It can also enable breeders to be familiar with the characteristics of pigs and improve feeding methods, etc.

　　The catering industry's use of waste to raise pigs is of great significance for increasing production and saving, improving the supply of meat in towns and cities, and improving people's daily lives. Regions and units with conditions may wish to try it. Liu Zhiqing

　　State-Owned Farms Should Not Buy Live Pigs Themselves

　　Currently, some state-owned farms directly go deep into the countryside and purchase live pigs in large quantities for consumption. For example, the "September 3rd" farm in Nenjiang County, Heilongjiang Province, recently rushed to purchase more than 80 live pigs in rural areas, with a purchase price per catty that was 0.07 to 0.15 yuan higher than the state price. They also deceived farmers by saying, "Selling pigs to us can offset the task of purchasing and ordering from the food company." Zhang Runmin, an administrator of the Keshan State-owned Farm, used methods such as building personal relationships, paying a "commission fee" of 1.20 yuan for buying a pig, paying 50% of the deposit in advance, and raising prices to rush to buy more than 200 live pigs. The Jianxin Farm in Guangxingzhou, Yueyang County, Hunan, in addition to the 1,100 to 1,200 catties of pork supplied by the food company every month, also constantly rushed to buy live pigs at high prices. Local farmers reflected, "The farm does not raise pigs, it carries meat with a carrying pole."

　　State-owned farms are production departments and have a large number of by-products that can be used as feed for raising pigs. Raising pigs on farms is beneficial to the farm's fertilizer accumulation and increased production, as well as to the workers' consumption of meat. I suggest that relevant departments immediately take measures to stop farms from buying pigs from rural areas without authorization, and stipulate appropriate production and sales tasks of live pigs for each state-owned farm.

　  食堂养猪好处多
    四川荣昌县大石堡煤矿有职工五百零三人，由于国家猪肉供应紧张，一般每人次只能吃上二、三两肉。后来，我们矿想出了自己养猪的办法，我们算了一下账：以每周每人食肉半斤计，全矿五百零三人需要二百五十斤左右；按这个数，全厂经常保持喂肥猪四十八只，能自给自足。每天食堂有淘米水和米汤等二千五百斤左右，菜皮、洗碗水等约五百斤，如全部集储起来，只要买上猪草及糠就解决了饲料问题。这四十八只猪，一年可积肥五十一万八千四百斤，按当地农民习惯每亩施肥五百斤计，可肥田一千亩，把这些肥料给农民，对农业增产是有力的支援。
    总之，养猪好处很多，真是“功在国家，利在每个人。”现在我们矿已照计划买了小猪，专门雇一人养猪，利用一间废草房，简单修理了一下，就有了猪舍。此外，工会还号召职工家属每户最低喂猪一头。　莫平和
    目前国家的粮食供应较紧，农民养猪感到饲料不足。但是抚顺市内的集体伙食单位很多，从几十人到上千人不等，那些油肥的泔水随脏水一起流掉真是可惜，这等于一年有多少口大肥猪顺水白扔了。如果这些单位自己不养猪，最好能把这些泔水积攒起来，供给农民喂猪。这些单位可以修一个池子储存泔水，为了卫生清洁在池口上还可加一个木板盖。农民最好也用木箱式的车拉泔水。这样做是一举两得，我希望有条件的伙食单位都能这样做。　马忠良
  　饮食业可用废料养猪
    饮食业所需要的猪肉数量很大，在目前全国猪肉供求紧张的情况下，常感供应不足。另方面，这个行业却有大量的泔水、粉浆、豆腐渣和烂菜等没有很好地利用。饮食业能否利用这些废料来自养生猪呢？天津市河北区、和平区饮食业养猪的经验提供了肯定的答案。
    这两个区的“董记”和“长发祥”两户私营粉房以前就曾利用粉渣在郊区饲养猪二十三头。全市饮食业公私合营以后，市饮食业公司河北区、和平区总店扩建了这两户的养猪场，饲养猪六十四头。指定本区的几户中西餐馆、豆浆房、粉房负责供给泔水、豆腐渣和粉浆，由养猪场每天拉回喂猪；此外还加一小部分糖糟、炭酸钙和红粱等。猪吃这些饲料长得很好，半年多就繁殖到一百二十来头。
    饮食业养猪不但可能，而且有利。据这个养猪场12月份开支的统计，当时饲养六十六头猪，共开支饲料费一百四十八元，平均每头猪每月饲料费为二元二角四分，一年共二十七元左右。再加上饲养员的工资（按每个饲养员养猪三十头，每人每月工资四十五元算），以及其他杂项开支，每头猪一年的总开支为五十元。而每头猪一年可增体重二百斤，按食品公司收购价格每斤四角三分算，则一头猪可值八十六元。因此，每头猪一年可获利三十元左右。
    饮食业能否大量养猪呢？天津市饮食业公司也算过这笔账：全市饮食业每天约有泔水、烂菜、粉浆等共一万多斤，豆腐渣十万多斤，可养猪一万七千头。即或有一部分作别用，仍可养猪一万头上下，一年可宰数千头。全市饮食业一年所需猪也不过数万头，可见自养猪数确实可观。
    此外，我觉得饮食业自养的肥猪基本上应该自用，部分合乎出口规格的肥猪可在自愿原则下卖给食品公司。饮食业自养肥猪后，食品公司可仍按原来对他们的计划供肉量供应，或酌量减少一部分，但决不能停止供应，这样才能鼓励他们普遍而大量的养猪。饮食业养猪最好是基本上采取自繁自养的方针，只在必要时，才从市场上买进一些小猪来育肥，这样可以防止猪瘟。并能不断改良猪种，供给一部分仔猪给郊区农民。还能使饲养人员熟悉猪的特性，改善饲养方法等。
    饮食业利用废料养猪对增产节约，改善城镇的肉食供应状况和人民日常生活都有较大意义，有条件的地区和单位不妨试办一下。

　　国营农场不该自购生猪
    目前有些国营农场直接深入乡村，大批购买生猪食用。如黑龙江省嫩江县“九三”农场，最近在农村抢购生猪达八十多头，每斤收购价格高出国家牌价七分到一角五分。他们还欺骗农民说：“把猪卖给我们可顶交食品公司的派购和订购任务。”克山国营农场管理员张润民用拉拢私人关系、代买一头猪给一元二角“委托费”、预付50％的定金以及提高价格等办法，抢购生猪二百多头。湖南岳阳县广兴洲的建新农场，每月除由食品公司供应猪肉一千一、二百斤外，还不断用高价抢购生猪。当地农民反映：“农场不养猪，吃肉用担子挑”。
    国营农场是生产部门，有大量的副产品可作饲料养猪，在农场养猪，对农场的积肥增产和职工吃肉都有利。我建议有关部门立即采取措施，制止农场擅自到农村买猪，并且给各国营农场规定适当的生猪生产和出售任务。　吴文林
