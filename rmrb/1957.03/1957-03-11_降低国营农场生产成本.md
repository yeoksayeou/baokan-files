Today, this newspaper publishes a report on three state-owned farms in Heilongjiang Province on the third page. It tells us that there are two different situations in the current state-owned farms: some state-owned farms are doing very well. Taking the Daxi Jiang Farm as an example, its machinery is the most dilapidated among the state-owned farms in Heilongjiang Province, and its other conditions are not better than those of other farms; however, last year this farm turned over 110,000 yuan in profits to the state. This is one situation. There are also some state-owned farms, like the Shuguang and Keshan farms, whose conditions in all aspects are not bad, and the yields of various crops are not low, but they lost money after a year of operation and settlement. They not only cannot help the state accumulate construction funds, but also cause some losses to the state. This is another situation.

Both are state-run farms, so why is there such a big difference? The former type of farm is carefully calculating in all aspects, trying every means to save expenses, reduce losses, and give full play to the labor potential of the personnel and the utilization rate of the equipment, thus reducing costs. The latter type of farm only cares about production and does not ask about costs, spends a lot of money, suffers a lot of losses and losses of grain and other materials, and does not pay attention to giving full play to equipment utilization and labor potential. What a clear contrast!

This contrast raises a major principle issue for the operation and management of state-owned farms, namely the issue of running farms diligently and thriftily. China now has hundreds of state-owned mechanical farms and ranches. In the past few years, they have reclaimed more than 13 million mu of cultivated land for the country, and the agricultural and animal products they provide to the country have also increased year by year. They also use a large number of improved crop varieties, improved livestock breeds, advanced agricultural technologies, and scientific knowledge to support agricultural production cooperatives. These achievements should be affirmed. But it must also be admitted that a considerable number of farms have been operating at a loss. According to a recent statistic made by the Ministry of Land Reclamation on 220 state-owned farms, 71 farms lost money last year, accounting for almost one-third of the total. In some provinces, the number of profitable farms is only a few, while the number of loss-making farms accounts for the majority. Heilongjiang Province is like this. The state hopes that state-owned farms will use modern machinery and equipment to reclaim as much wasteland as possible, increase the production of grain, industrial raw materials and other products, and accumulate funds for the state; at the same time, they will play a demonstrative role for the vast number of farmers and agricultural cooperatives. But if the farm loses money for a long time, it cannot accumulate funds for the country, nor can it play a demonstrative role for agricultural cooperatives with its superior production and operation. In order to change this loss-making situation, all state-owned farms should implement the principle of running farms diligently and thriftily, and must increase production and practice economy and accumulate funds.

The principle of running farms diligently and thriftily should be reflected in several aspects. First, the administrative management organization must be streamlined, not bloated. If, like the Shuguang and Keshan farms, the management personnel reach 22%-24% of the total number of employees, they will definitely lose money, because the non-productive expenses are too large. At present, the management personnel of state-owned farms across the country generally account for more than 10% of the total number of employees, and this proportion is still too high. Although the management personnel of the Daxi Jiang Farm account for 11.9% of the total number of employees, most of the management personnel go to the fields to participate in production labor during the busy farming season. On the one hand, this shows that the comrades of the Daxi Jiang Farm have a high level of consciousness and a good work style, and on the other hand, it also shows that the management organization can be further reduced. Second, we must try our best to save expenses in all aspects. For example, the Daxi Jiang Farm organized the management personnel and the family members of the employees to participate in production labor during the busy farming season, which greatly saved the expenses of hiring temporary workers; while the Keshan Farm, which has a large proportion of management personnel, did not do this, but spent 600,000 yuan on temporary wages. Third, we must try our best to reduce and avoid damage, loss and waste of means of production, means of subsistence and products. The Daxi Jiang Farm implements mass management, and special personnel are responsible for the safekeeping of any items, and there are reasonable quotas and systems for the use of various raw materials, so it avoids the abnormal large amount of loss like the Keshan and Shuguang farms. This method is also worth learning by state-owned farms in various places. Fourth, make do with whatever is available, and try to tap potential and give full play to equipment utilization. The Daxi Jiang Farm tried its best to use the existing cars, as well as horse-drawn carts and iron-wheeled trolleys, in transportation, avoiding the easy request for external assistance like the Keshan Farm, and as a result, the transportation cost was much lower than that of the Keshan Farm.

To achieve these goals, the leaders and employees of the farm must have a sense of ownership towards the state property and the farm's cause, like the comrades of the Daxi Jiang Farm, "calculate first whether it is appropriate" in everything, implement the principle of running farms diligently and thriftily, and overcome the phenomenon of losses. For this purpose, first of all, education work should be carried out well among all personnel of state-owned farms to establish the idea of ​​loving the farm and accumulating funds for the country. At present, the work in this regard is still quite weak in many state-owned farms, and it must be greatly strengthened.

Using all means to eliminate the phenomena of bureaucracy and paperwork in leadership is also an important measure to implement the principle of running farms diligently and thriftily. The Shuguang Farm has so many administrative management personnel (some farms have even more), and spent a huge sum of more than 46,000 yuan to purchase pest control machinery and equipment, but did not investigate how many insects there were, but just shouted to catch insects from top to bottom. Facts have proved that this was a huge waste. If such a serious bureaucratic style is not overcome, the slogan of running farms diligently and thriftily can only become empty talk.

Making full use of the internal human resources and various resources to develop multi-departmental economy is a good way for state-owned farms to increase income and avoid losses. At present, most farms raise very few livestock, so that many by-products that can be used as livestock feed have not been rationally utilized, and the difficulty of farms lacking fertilizer cannot be overcome. In order to change this phenomenon, state-owned farms in various places should closely integrate agriculture with animal husbandry, so that the two departments can promote each other and develop together. This will not only increase the production of more agricultural products, but also increase the production of more animal products. In order to give full play to labor potential and make full use of by-products, state-owned farms can also plan to operate a part of small-scale processing of agricultural products and other agricultural-related side occupations. Local experience has proved that implementing diversified operations according to local conditions has a great effect on overcoming the loss-making phenomenon of farms. State-owned farms in Hubei Province (including local state-owned farms) lost 220,000 yuan in 1955; in 1956, they changed their policies, engaged in agriculture on the one hand, adjusted crop types, and strived to increase yield per unit area, and on the other hand, actively carried out diversified operations such as pig raising, beekeeping, and agricultural product processing. As a result, all farms had surpluses.

Because of the insufficient area of cultivated land, the state requires state-owned farms in various places to reclaim more wasteland this year than last year, and various farms are also formulating plans to complete this task. In this regard, it is also required to try our best to reduce the cost of wasteland reclamation. Some farms have not actively tried to reduce the cost of wasteland reclamation, but plan to avoid losses by reclaiming less wasteland, which is not right.

The spring plowing season of 1957 has arrived. As long as each state-owned farm firmly grasps the principle of running farms diligently and thriftily, mobilizes all employees, and actively tries to increase production and practice economy, it will surely be able to strive for a greater harvest, reclaim more wasteland, and enable its own farm to hand over more products to the state, and also hand over more profits to the state.

### 降低国营农场生产成本

    降低国营农场生产成本
    今天本报第三版发表关于黑龙江省的三个国营农场的通讯，它告诉我们，在目前的国营农场中，存在着两种不同的情况：一部分国营农场办得很好。以大西江农场为例，它的机器装备在黑龙江全省的国营农场中是最破旧的，其他方面的条件也不比别的农场好；但是，去年这个农场却向国家缴了十一万元的利润。这是一种情况。也有一部分国营农场，像曙光、克山那样的农场，它们的各方面条件并不坏，各种作物的产量也不算低，但是经营一年，到年底结算却赔了本。它们不仅不能帮助国家积累建设资金，还给国家造成一些亏累。这又是一种情况。
    同是国家经营的农场，为什么会有这样大的差别呢？前一种农场是从各方面精打细算，想尽办法节省开支，减少损耗，充分发挥场内人员的劳动潜力和设备的利用率，降低了成本。后一种农场却只管生产，不问成本，大量花钱，大量损耗和丢失粮食及其他物资，不注意发挥设备利用率和劳动潜力。这是多么鲜明的对比啊！
    这个对比给国营农场的经营管理提出一个重大的原则问题，就是勤俭办场的问题。我国现在有几百个国营的机械农场和牧场，几年来它们给国家开垦了一千三百多万亩耕地，给国家提供的农产品和畜产品也逐年增加，并且用大量的作物良种、牲畜良种和先进的农业技术、科学知识支援了农业生产合作社。这些成绩都应该肯定。但是也得承认，有相当数量的农场一直是亏本经营的。据农垦部最近所作的二百二十个国营农场的统计，去年有七十一个农场亏本，几乎占总数三分之一。在某些省份，盈利的农场只是少数，亏损的农场却占多数。黑龙江省就是这样。国家希望国营农场运用现代化的机器装备去尽量垦荒，增产粮食、工业原料和其他产品，为国家积累资金；同时对广大农民和农业合作社起示范作用。但是如果农场长期赔本，它就不能为国家积累资金，也不能以生产经营的优越性对农业社起示范作用。为了改变这种赔本的状况，所有的国营农场都应该实行勤俭办场的原则，必须增产节约和积累资金。
    勤俭办场的原则，应该体现在几个方面。第一，行政管理机构必须精干，不能臃肿。如果像曙光、克山两农场那样，管理人员达到职工总数的22％—24％，就一定会赔本，因为非生产性的开支太大了。现在全国各地国营农场的管理人员，一般都占到职工总数10％以上，这个比例也还是偏高的。大西江农场管理人员虽然占职工总数11.9％，但在农忙的时候大部分管理人员都下地参加生产劳动，这一方面说明大西江农场的同志们的觉悟高、作风好，另一方面也说明管理机构还可以进一步缩小。第二，要尽力节省各方面的开支。比如，大西江农场在农忙的时候组织本场管理人员和职工家属参加生产劳动，就大大节省了雇临时工的开支；而管理人员占很大比例的克山农场，却没有这样做，反而花了六十万元的临时工资。第三，要尽力减少和避免生产资料、生活资料和生产物的损坏、丢失和浪费。大西江农场实行群众性的管理，任何物品都有专人负责保管，各项原材料的使用都有合理的定额和制度，因而避免了像克山、曙光农场那样非正常的大量损耗。这个办法也值得各地国营农场学习。第四，因陋就简，有甚么用甚么，尽量发掘潜力和发挥设备利用率。大西江农场在运输方面尽量利用了现有的汽车以及马车和铁轮小车，避免了像克山农场那样轻易向外要求援助，结果运输成本就比克山农场低得多。
    要做到这些，农场领导人员和职工群众对国家财产和农场事业必须抱着主人翁的态度，像大西江农场的同志们那样凡事“先算一算是不是合适”，贯彻实现勤俭办场的原则，克服赔累现象。为了这个目的，首先应当在国营农场的全体人员中很好地进行教育工作，树立热爱农场和为国家积累资金的思想。目前许多国营农场在这方面的工作还相当薄弱，必须大力加强。
    用一切办法扫除领导上的官僚主义和文牍主义现象，也是贯彻勤俭办场的一个重要措施。曙光农场行政管理人员那么多（有些农场比这还要多），花费四万六千多元的巨款去置备除虫药械，却没有调查研究虫子究竟有多少，只是从上到下大喊捉虫。事实证明这是一次巨大的浪费。像这样严重的官僚主义作风如果不加以克服，勤俭办场的口号就只能变成空喊。
    充分利用场内的人力和各种资源，发展多部门的经济，是国营农场增加收入、避免亏本的好办法。现在多数农场养畜很少，使许多可以作牲畜饲料用的副产物没有得到合理的利用，使农场缺少肥料的困难无法克服。为了改变这种现象，各地国营农场应该把农业同畜牧业密切配合起来，使两个部门互相促进，共同发展。这样不但能增产更多的农产品，还能增产更多的畜产品。为了发挥劳动潜力和充分利用副产物，国营农场还可以有计划地经营一部分农产品的小型加工业和其他同农业有关的副业。各地经验证明，实行因地制宜的多种经营，对于克服农场的亏本现象有很大的作用。湖北省的国营农场（包括地方国营农场）在1955年亏损二十二万元；1956年改变方针，一面搞农业，调整作物种类，努力提高单位面积产量，一面积极开展了养猪、养蜂、农产品加工等多种经营，结果所有的农场都有了盈余。
    因为耕地面积不足，国家要求各地国营农场在今年比去年开垦更多的荒地，各农场也正在制订完成这项任务的计划。在这个方面，同样要求尽力降低开荒的成本。有些农场没有积极地想办法降低开荒成本，而打算用少开荒的办法来避免赔累，这是不对的。
    1957年的春耕季节来到了。各个国营农场只要紧紧地掌握住勤俭办场这个原则，发动全体职工，积极想办法增产节约，一定能够争取更大的丰收，开垦更多的荒地，使自己的农场既能交给国家更多的产品，又能交给国家更多的利润。
