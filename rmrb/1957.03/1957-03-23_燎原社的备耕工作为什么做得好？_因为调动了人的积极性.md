Why is the Liaoyuan Cooperative's Preparatory Work for Spring Farming So Good?
　　Because it Mobilized People's Enthusiasm
　　Gao Changren Kang Bitai

　　The Liaoyuan Agricultural Cooperative is the largest advanced cooperative in Xinhua County, Hunan, with more than 1,200 households. Last year, it suffered from a drought, and agricultural production decreased by 25% compared with 1955; however, by developing diversified operations, they made up for the agricultural losses, and 92% of the members still increased their income. In order to strive for a bumper harvest this year, the members carried out a series of spring farming preparations in the severe winter. Now the fields are even more bustling.

　　Standing on a small hill and looking around, the spring farming scene of the Liaoyuan Cooperative is very moving. In the fields, the green wheat seedlings have covered the land. In order to overcome the disaster, the cooperative planted spring-harvest crops on 80% of the total cultivated land last winter. That patch of black land is the hardened soil that was plowed over in winter, and some of the fields have already been filled with vast expanses of white water. Double-cropping rice will be planted in these fields this year. Walking on the stone slab road that runs across a large area of paddy fields, we often have to give way to members carrying fertilizer on shoulder poles. In many large ponds, the water has been drained, and male and female members are carrying the blackened pond mud. This year, pond mud is still an important source of fertilizer for the cooperative. There are also many people carrying vegetable garden soil, and most of them are female members. In the Sixteenth Team, we met a youth shock brigade carrying old mountain soil down from a small mountain, and a group of young people from the Fifteenth Team were digging up a pile of old, broken soil at the foot of a small hill. We estimated that these broken soils were probably seventy or eighty years old, and the young people said with a smile: "It hasn't been touched for three seventy or eighty years." He added playfully: "This is the fertilizer left to us by our ancestors." Last autumn, all 24 teams in the cooperative built three or four large manure pits each, and now these manure pits are almost full. These fertilizers are collected from the members' homes. According to the management committee's recent statistics, the task of accumulating 50 dan of fertilizer per mu of land (various miscellaneous fertilizers converted into main fertilizers) has now been completed by 80%. This year, due to the implementation of the policy of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily, the members have found more than 20 kinds of fertilizer sources.

　　On a sunny hillside, a large buffalo is tethered, and an old member occasionally picks up a few withered grasses that have just turned green from the ground and puts them into the cow's mouth. Sometimes, he scratches the cow's body with his hands, removing some dirty things. The old member is from the Sixth Production Team and is named Liu Guoguang, and he is 71 years old. This cow was bought by him for more than 60 yuan three years ago. After joining the cooperative, the cooperative entrusted him with raising the cow. Seeing that the old man has experience in feeding cattle as the cow looks round and fat. In this cooperative, we saw dozens of cattle that were as fat and strong as those raised by Liu Guoguang. We didn't see a single thin cow. Some cows have gone down to the fields to plow, some are basking in the sun without anything to do, and some big bulls are still moo-mooing, as if they are tired of being idle for a winter and are now eager to go down to the fields to work!

　　The cooperative's water conservancy project was basically completed last winter, and now there is still a bit of finishing work to be done. We saw a project originally called "Maple Tree Pond," now called "Bumper Harvest Reservoir." This pond could only irrigate 30 to 40 mu of land originally; now, a yellow dam, connecting two small hills, has become a small reservoir, and its irrigation capacity has been increased to more than 300 mu of land. Even larger than this reservoir is the Yanjing Reservoir, which covers an area of ​​80 mu. In addition, there is a 6-li-long canal, Huangsha Pond, Xie Jia Pond... These projects were built successively after the cooperative was upgraded to an advanced cooperative last year. According to the director of the cooperative, of the more than 4,900 mu of paddy fields in the cooperative, 4,300 mu can resist drought for 60 days. Only 600 mu of land still have relatively poor water conservancy conditions this year, but they can still resist drought for 20 to 40 days.

　　Why is the Liaoyuan Cooperative's preparatory work for spring farming so good? The main key is that they eliminated the negative emotions of the members and cadres, gave full play to their enthusiasm, and solved the main problems in the preparation for spring farming. For example, the dependence of cadres and members of the cooperative on production funds and fertilizers was resolved only after careful work.

　　This kind of dependency thinking has historical roots. From land reform to collectivization, the Liaoyuan Cooperative has always been the focus of the county party committee. In 1953, an agricultural cooperative was established on a trial basis. At that time, in order to support this newborn bud, the government invested a batch of loans every year to help them overcome difficulties. Also, because the cooperative is close to the urban area, most of the fertilizers used every year are manure from urban areas and schools. In this way, the cadres and members of the cooperative have developed a habit - as soon as there is a little difficulty, they ask the government for help.

　　This year, in the preparatory work for spring farming, they encountered problems such as insufficient funds and lack of fertilizer. At the beginning, the cadres and members of the cooperative also wanted to rely on the government to help solve them. But the situation is different this year. Xinhua County is a disaster-stricken county, and Liaoyuan Cooperative is a production-guaranteeing cooperative, so loans cannot be given; now that advanced agricultural cooperation has been realized throughout the county, the nearby agricultural cooperatives are also dissatisfied with the Liaoyuan Cooperative's monopolizing the manure in the city; from the perspective of the Liaoyuan Cooperative itself, borrowing a large amount of loans from the state and buying more commercial fertilizers does not conform to the spirit of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily.

　　The work group stationed in the cooperative by the Xinhua County Committee of the Communist Party of China has held four meetings since December last year and has done a lot of persuasive education work in order to mobilize the members to solve the problems of funds and fertilizers themselves.

　　At the beginning, the cadres of the cooperative believed that a total of more than 110,000 yuan of funds were needed for production this year. In addition to the more than 60,000 yuan that could be solved by the cooperative itself, there was still a shortage of 49,000 yuan, which needed government assistance to overcome this difficulty. At this time, the work group criticized the idea of ​​dependency from the fact that Xinhua County is a disaster area and the government's loans are limited, and that too many loans will not only affect the country's industrial construction, but also prevent the members from increasing their actual income. The work group helped them calculate three detailed accounts: First, the account of the agricultural cooperatives in Xinhua County that need loans. A total of 1,219 cooperatives in the county need to borrow money. If each cooperative borrows only 2,000 yuan, it will need a total of more than 2 million yuan in loans. This year, the county's agricultural loan target is only 700,000 to 800,000 yuan, so it should rely on its own efforts to solve difficulties. Second, the account of the members' affordability. Last year, the Liaoyuan Cooperative borrowed more than 50,000 yuan, but only repaid more than 10,000 yuan, and now it still owes 43,000 yuan, and each household has to bear tens of yuan. If this year's funds still rely on the government to solve, making the members' burden too heavy, the members' lives will become a problem. Third, the income account of the entire cooperative in the first and second quarters. The Liaoyuan Cooperative can solve more than 30,000 yuan from sideline income, inventory materials, and spring-harvest crops in the first and second quarters. Finally, after further tapping potential, many methods were devised, such as accumulating more soil fertilizer to reduce the purchase of commercial fertilizers, selling more spring-harvest crops, mobilizing members to invest, and reducing some projects that could be used or not, and finally digging out more than 10,000 yuan of fund potential, without state loans, can completely solve the fund problem by itself.

　　After the members and cadres realized these problems, they adopted some specific measures and stipulated some reasonable systems. For example, in mobilizing the members to invest, it is specifically stipulated that all those who transfer their savings accounts for investment will be paid interest by the cooperative according to the interest rate of the credit cooperative. For example, when calling on the members' household fertilizer to invest in the cooperative, the cooperative will also reasonably allocate tasks to the members according to the number and size of people and pigs in each household; the household fertilizer will be divided into four grades, and different prices will be stipulated. In order to encourage the enthusiasm of the members, it is also stipulated that from March, if the household fertilizer investment exceeds the task, the cooperative will pay cash. In this way, the interests of the cooperative and the interests of the members are combined, giving full play to everyone's production enthusiasm. Now, most of the members of the cooperative are very enthusiastic about investing in the cooperative. For example, the Seventeenth Team reported more than 100 yuan of investment funds in one night, and Zeng Suzhen, a female member of the Twenty-third Team, held a meeting on February 26 and personally sent 10 yuan to the office on the morning of the 27th as an investment. The household fertilizer of each production team is invested in the cooperative on a monthly basis, and most of them can exceed the task. The cooperative's plan will soon become a reality.

　　Because people's enthusiasm has been brought into play, some other problems of this cooperative have also been solved smoothly. Now, the Liaoyuan Cooperative has challenged the agricultural cooperatives in Xinhua County, the main conditions are that this year's grain production will increase by 40% compared with last year; the cooperative will be run diligently and thriftily, and no state loans will be required; agricultural and sideline industries will be developed in an all-round way to increase the income of the members.

　　燎原社的备耕工作为什么做得好？
　　因为调动了人的积极性

    燎原农业社是湖南新化县规模最大的一个高级社，全社一千二百多户。去年遭受旱灾，农业上比1955年减产25％；但由于发展多种经营，他们又把农业的损失找了回来，使92％的社员还是增加了收入。社员们为了争取今年的大丰收，在严寒的冬季，就进行了一系列的春耕准备工作。现在的田野里，更加沸腾起来了。
    站在小丘上抬眼四望，燎原社的春耕景色，十分动人。田野上，碧绿的麦苗已遮盖了大地。为了战胜灾荒，这个社去年冬天种下的春收作物，占总田亩的80％。那一片黑黑的土地，是冬季就翻耕过来的板田，有些田里已经灌上茫茫的白水，今年这些田里都将种上双季稻。走在横贯大片水田的石板路上，我们得常常为挑着肥料担子的社员让路。在许多大塘里，塘水放干了，男女社员都在挑着那发黑的塘泥。有的塘里，挑完塘泥，又灌上一塘混水。今年，塘泥还是这个社的重要肥源。挑菜园土的人也非常多，干这个活的大半是女社员。在十六队，我们正遇见青年突击队员从小山上挑下老山土，十五队的一组青年在小山坡下挖着一堆陈旧的碎土，我们估计这些碎土大概有七、八十年了，青年人笑着说：“有三个七八十年没动过了。”他又俏皮地补上一句：“这是老祖宗给我们留下来的肥料。”去年秋天，全社二十四个队，每队都新建了三四个大粪窖，现在，这些粪窖都快装满了。这些肥料都是从社员家里收集来的。据管委会前些日子的统计，今年要求每亩田积肥五十担（各种杂肥折成主肥计算）的任务，现在已完成80％了。今年由于执行勤俭办社的方针，社员们找出二十多种肥源来。
    一个向阳的小山坡上，拴着一头大水牛，旁边一个老社员不时从地上拾起几根刚刚转青的枯草，送到牛嘴里。有时，他又用手在牛身上搔一搔，抓一抓，剔除一些脏东西下来。老社员是第六生产队的，名叫刘国光，七十一岁了。这头牛是他在三年前花六十多元买来的，入社后，社里又把牛包给他喂养。看那条牛长得滚圆的，就知道老人喂牛是有经验的。老人告诉我们，这头牛过了一冬，足足长了二十多斤。在这个社里，我们看到的几十头耕牛，都和刘国光喂养的一样肥壮。没有看到一头瘦牛。有的牛下水耕田了，有的还没事做在晒太阳，有的大牯牛还呣呣地叫着，似乎它们闲了一冬闲厌了，现在正想下田干活呢！
    这个社的水利工程在去年冬季就基本完成了，现在还有一点尾巴。我们看到一口原名叫“枫树大塘”现在叫“丰产水库”的工程。这座塘，原来只能灌田三、四十亩；现在，一道黄色的大堤，连接着两个小丘陵，已经变成一座小水库，它的灌溉能力已提高到三百多亩田了。比这个水库还大的有盐井水库，面积有八十亩大，此外还有六里长的一条水圳、黄沙塘、谢家塘……这些工程都是去年转高级社以后陆续兴建的。据社主任说，现在全社四千九百多亩水田中，已有四千三百亩田能抗旱六十天。只有六百亩田今年水利条件还不大好，但还是可以抗旱二十到四十天。
    燎原社的备耕工作为什么做得这样好呢？主要关键是他们消除了社员和干部的消极情绪，发挥他们的积极性，解决了备耕中的主要问题。比如这个社从社干到社员中对生产资金和肥料普遍存在着的依赖思想，就是经过一番细致的工作才解决的。
    这种依赖思想是有历史根源的。燎原社从土地改革到高级化一贯是县委的重点。1953年就试办了一个农业社，当时，政府为了扶植这个新生的幼芽，每年都投放一批贷款，帮助他们克服困难。又由于这个社靠近城关，每年所用的肥料，大部分是城关、学校中的大粪。这样，就使这个社的干部、社员养成了一个习惯——稍微有点困难，就要求政府帮助。
    今年备耕工作中，又遇到了资金不够、肥料缺乏等问题，开始社干、社员也是想依靠政府帮助解决的。但是今年情况不同了，新化县是个受灾县，燎原社是个保产社，不能给予贷款；现在全县实现了高级农业合作化，附近的农业社对于燎原社包揽城里的大粪，也不满意；从燎原社本身来说，向国家大量贷款和多买商品肥料，也不符合勤俭办社的精神。
    中共新化县委驻社工作组，为了发动社员自己解决资金和肥料问题，从去年12月以来曾开过四次会议，做了许多说服教育工作。
    开始，社干部认为今年生产共需要十一万多元的资金，除了本社能解决六万多元外，还缺四万九千元，需要政府扶助，才能克服这个困难。这时，工作组就从新化县是灾区，政府贷款有限，以及贷款过多不但影响国家工业建设，而且社员也不能增加实际收入，批判了依赖思想。工作组帮助他们算三笔细账：一是新化县的农业社需要贷款账，全县共一千二百十九个社，每个社只贷款二千元，就共需要贷款二百多万元，今年全县农贷指标只有七八十万元，因此应自力更生，自己解决困难。二是社员的负担能力账，去年燎原社贷款五万多元，只还了一万多元，现在还欠四万三千元，每户社员要负担几十元。如果今年的资金还靠政府解决，使社员负担过重，社员生活就会成问题。三是全社在一二季度的收入账，燎原社一二季度可从副业收入、库存物资、春收作物等方面解决三万多元。最后经过进一步发掘潜力，又想出许多办法，如多积土肥减少购买商品肥料，多卖一些春收作物，发动社员投资，再减少一些可用可不用的项目，终于又挖出了一万多元的资金潜力，不要国家贷款，自己可以完全解决资金问题。
    社员和干部认识到了这些问题以后，采取了一些具体措施，规定了一些合理的制度。如在发动社员投资中，便具体规定凡是把存钱转账作投资的，社里照信用社的利率出利息。又如号召社员的家肥向社投资的时候，也由社里根据各户人和猪的多少和大小，向社员合理分配任务；把家肥分成四等，规定不同的价格。为了鼓励社员的积极性，还规定从3月份起，家肥投资超过任务的，就由社里付给现金。这样，就把社的利益和社员的利益结合起来，发挥了每个人的生产积极性。现在，这个社的大部分社员向社投资很踊跃，如十七队一个晚上就自报投资款一百多元，二十三队女社员曾素贞2月26日开了会，27日早晨亲送了十元到办公室作为投资。每个生产队的家肥都按月向社投资，大部分都能超过。社里的计划很快就要变成现实了。
    由于发挥了人的积极性，这个社的其他一些问题也都顺利地解决了。现在燎原社已经向新化全县的农业社提出挑战，主要条件是今年比去年增产粮食40％；勤俭办社，不要国家贷款；全面发展农副业增加社员收入。
