Xinhua News Agency, March 24th — The State Council approved the Ministry of Commerce's report on coal market arrangements for 1957 on March 18th.

　　The report, after analyzing the situation of coal supply falling short of demand in the market in 1956, pointed out that coal is a very important commodity related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and its sales plan must be based on a solid and reliable foundation. Therefore, the market supply in 1957 must be arranged according to the following principles:

　　(1) Urban and rural areas must vigorously conserve coal.

　　(2) Ensure the minimum necessary supply for cities to avoid affecting industrial production and the lives of urban residents; basically maintain the 1956 supply level for general industry, handicrafts, and service industries that do not apply for coal; and reduce coal for heating in government agencies, organizations, and brick and tile kilns.

　　(3) Appropriately reduce the supply to rural areas, because the increase in rural areas last year was excessive, and the potential for conservation is greater than in cities. As long as fuel arrangements in rural areas are included in the agricultural production plan, and if there are no major disasters after the summer and autumn harvests, the rural coal sales can be reduced to some extent.

　　The report requires the Party and government organs at all levels to lead the commercial departments to implement the following specific measures:

　　(1) Actively organize the production of small-kiln coal to ensure and overfulfill the coal construction company's purchase plan; as long as it does not damage national resources and can be transported, small-kiln coal production can be organized. Coal construction companies should actively organize purchases and, if necessary, can sign three-year purchase contracts. If the purchase of small-kiln coal results in losses due to high production costs and transportation expenses, a special report can be submitted to the Ministry of Commerce for compensation.

　　(2) All localities should include coal conservation as an important part of the campaign to increase production and practice economy. Industrial and service industries should vigorously conserve coal, and the use of coal for heating in government agencies, troops, organizations, schools, etc., should be strictly controlled in accordance with the State Council's past instructions. Extensive publicity should be carried out regarding the conservation of civilian coal, and the exchange and promotion of experience in saving coal should be organized at any time.

　　(3) In order to properly arrange the sales plan, please ask the Party and government organs at all levels to lead the commercial departments to rank the supply targets according to the availability of goods, so as to distinguish between priorities and master the supply. Provinces with transfer tasks should actively organize shipments according to the plan, in the spirit of mutual support and overcoming difficulties together, both to solve domestic difficulties and to take care of the urgent needs of other places.

　　(4) In areas supplying coal to rural areas, the reliable amount of coal that can be supplied to each agricultural production cooperative this year should be announced to the agricultural cooperatives as soon as possible, so that the agricultural cooperatives can prepare early and include firewood in this year's agricultural production plan. Appropriate consideration should be given to the livelihood coal for farmers in disaster areas and areas with severe firewood shortages.

　　(5) No new rural coal sales organizations should be added. The number of rural coal-burning households should not be increased, and should be appropriately reduced. Sales on credit should be resolutely stopped. Unreasonable price differences in rural areas should be adjusted. The reasons for insufficient coal supply should be correctly publicized and explained. Coal construction companies will no longer supply units that are uniformly allocated by the state.

　　(6) The lump coal and coking coal required by industry and handicrafts should be directly applied for and allocated by the production departments, and uniformly arranged by the State Economic Commission; those who use lump coal for winter heating and residents' living habits should make early arrangements and produce more coal briquettes for supply.

　　The report finally requested that the coal production and transportation departments allocate and transport more during the market off-season, and give possible consideration to the order and timing of shipments in winter.

　　国务院批准商业部今年煤炭市场安排报告
　　各地城乡必须大力节约煤炭
    新华社24日讯　国务院在3月18日批准了商业部关于1957年煤炭市场安排的报告。
    这个报告在分析了1956年市场上煤炭供不应求的情况以后指出，煤炭是关系国计民生十分重大的商品之一，它的销售计划必须打在稳妥可靠的基础上。因此，1957年的市场供应，必须根据以下原则安排：
    （1）城乡都必须大力节约煤炭。
    （2）保证城市最低限度的必要供应，以免影响工业生产和城市人民生活；对非申请单位的一般工业、手工业和服务业用煤，基本上维持1956年供应水平；压缩机关、团体烤火煤和砖瓦窑业用煤。
    （3）适当减少农村供应，因为去年农村增加过多，节约的潜力比城市大，只要把农村的燃料安排在农业生产计划之内，在夏收、秋收之后如果不发生大的灾情，农村销煤是有条件减少一些的。
    报告要求各地党政机关领导商业部门贯彻以下几项具体措施：
      （1）积极组织小窑煤生产，保证和超额完成煤建公司收购计划；只要不破坏国家资源，能够外运，就可以组织小窑煤生产。煤建公司应当积极组织收购，必要时可以订立三年收购合同。由于小窑煤生产成本和运输费用高，如果收购亏损，可以专案报商业部弥补。
      （2）各地应当把节约煤炭工作列为增产节约运动的一项重要内容。工业、服务业用煤要大力节约，机关、部队、团体、学校等烤火用煤，根据国务院过去指示，要严格控制。关于民用煤的节约要广泛宣传，并且随时组织交流和推广节省烧煤的经验。
      （3）为了妥善安排销售计划，请各地党政机关领导商业部门按照货源的情况进行供应对象的排队，以便区别轻重缓急，掌握供应。有调出任务的省要按计划积极组织发运，本互相支援、共同克服困难的精神，既要解决省内困难，也要照顾外地的迫切需要。
      （4）在供应农村煤炭的地区，要把本年可以供应各农业生产合作社的可靠的煤炭数量及早向农业社公布，使农业社早作准备，将烧柴列入本年农业生产计划之内。对灾区和严重缺柴区的农民生活用煤，应有适当照顾。
      （5）不增设农村销煤机构。农村烧煤户不再发展，并作适当收缩。坚决停止赊销。调整不合理的农村地区差价。正确宣传解释煤炭供应不足的道理。对国家统一分配的单位，煤建公司一律不再供应。
      （6）工业、手工业所需块煤和焦煤，由生产部门直接申请分配，由国家经济委员会统一安排；冬季烤火及居民生活习惯用块煤者，应早作安排，多生产煤球供应。
    报告最后要求煤炭生产部门和交通运输部门在市场淡季时多拨多运，在冬季发运的次序和时间上给以可能的照顾。
