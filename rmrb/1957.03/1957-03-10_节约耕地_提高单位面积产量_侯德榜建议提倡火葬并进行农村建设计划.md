I fully endorse Honorary Chairman Mao's instructions and Premier Zhou's report on his visit to eleven countries, and I agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of the suggestions for the Second Five-Year Plan, as well as Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the Standing Committee.

At this conference, it is a rare opportunity for everyone to gather together, offer opinions, and discuss the nation's "increase production and practice economy" issues. Our socialist construction should rely on the people increasing production and practicing economy to accumulate funds and pay for various construction investments. In particular, this year, 1957, is the final year of the First Five-Year Plan, which allows us to summarize the experiences of the five years and prepare for the work of the Second Five-Year Plan.

Agriculture is an Important Source of National Construction Funds

Before liberation, the reactionary regime plundered the people and did not carry out construction. Even if there was some construction, it was financed by foreign debt, inviting wolves into the house and allowing imperialists to intensify their aggression against China. After liberation, the reactionary regime was overthrown, the people became masters of their own affairs, and we were freed from imperialist aggression, relying on our own strength to carry out construction. There are two sources of funds for accumulation in our country: one is through increased production and thrift in industry, and the other is through increased production and thrift in agriculture. Industrial profits mainly come from light industry, and light industry is inseparable from agriculture. 90% of the raw materials for light industry come from agriculture, and 70% of light industry products are sold in rural areas. The foreign exchange earned for importing machinery also requires agricultural products, because 75% of export goods are agricultural and sideline products. So, in the final analysis, the source of capital accumulation mainly depends on agriculture. Therefore, our Party and government's emphasis on increasing production and practicing economy in agriculture is entirely correct.

As Vice Premier Deng Zihui pointed out at the National Agricultural Labor Model Representatives Conference, agricultural production increase should focus on two aspects: expanding the cultivated area and increasing the yield per unit area. In my personal experience, China is not like the Soviet Union and cannot have large-scale reclamation, because the arable land in the Soviet Union is several times larger than that of our country, while the population is only one-third of ours. The open land in our country is mainly in the northwest and southwest, but it must be combined with soil protection to avoid soil erosion and gradually carry out planned land reclamation, while retaining a portion of the land as pasture for livestock. Therefore, expanding the cultivated area in our country can only be carried out under limited conditions. Therefore, it is necessary for us to conserve the existing cultivated land, increase the yield per unit area, and, more importantly, maintain and utilize the existing cultivated land area. A brief analysis is as follows:

　　(1) Increasing production per unit area depends on fertilizer. At present, the production of chemical fertilizers in our country is not enough to meet the demand, so we can only rely on farmers to accumulate fertilizer, whether it is green manure, animal manure, or silt from ditches and canals. Farmers are already actively doing this, and with great success. We must use scientific methods to study the relationship between fertilizer and soil to give full play to its fertilizer effect.

　　(2) Water conservancy construction. Despite the availability of fertilizer, crops cannot grow without water. Therefore, it is necessary to build canals and dig wells. The state is vigorously carrying out water conservancy construction for rural areas; our agricultural production cooperatives are also carrying it out; state and village cadres are also assisting cooperatives in promoting this work. This is the basic construction work in agriculture.

　　(3) Increase the multiple cropping index. This means increasing the number of harvests from farmland in a year. In northern farmland, it is generally one crop; in the south, it is two crops; in Fujian, Guangdong, and Hainan Island, there are often three crops. One crop can be planted with miscellaneous grains for another crop, turning it into two crops; two crops can be intercropped and the planting season adjusted, at least achieving five crops in two years. This is not difficult. The main thing is to have enough fertilizer so that increasing the number of harvests does not affect the quantity of each harvest.

　　(4) Eliminate pests and diseases. Wheat and rice both have blight, which makes them produce poor yields. Cotton has aphids and red spiders; fruits have borers; dry land has locusts. All of these require pesticides. However, pesticide production in our country is still lagging behind demand, so we can only rely on farmers to manually eliminate them or pick out seeds carrying insects to eliminate or reduce pests and diseases.

　　(5) Improve agricultural technology. This means selecting and breeding seeds, intensive cultivation, transplanting and dense planting, turning up new soil from underground (deep plowing), and promoting new agricultural tools and advanced experiences to increase the productivity per unit area. Our supply of tractors cannot meet the demand, so relying on tractors for deep plowing is currently unrealistic.

In addition, our farmers must follow the state's rural economic indicators and choose high-yielding crops as much as possible, such as rice, corn, and sweet potatoes, and change dry land into paddy fields, but also follow the state's requirements for cash crops to meet the needs of crops such as cotton and oil.

Rural Population is Rapidly Increasing, and the Existing Cultivated Land Area is Shrinking

The above are all effective methods that our farmers are already doing, so I won't talk much about them. I want to talk about maintaining the existing area of cultivated land. I want to talk about the relationship between rural cultivated land and the increase in the rural population. Because with the increase in population, births, marriages, deaths, and funerals are bound to become more frequent. I grew up in a rural area in Fujian Province. Every few years, I would return to my hometown to take a look. What caught my attention the most was that the rural population increased more and more each time, reflected in a significant increase in houses and a significant decrease in the area of cultivated land. Not only did the house sites occupy cultivated land, but the roads, courtyards in front of and behind the houses also occupied cultivated land. I came to a conclusion: the area of rural cultivated land is inversely proportional to the rural population. This is a shocking thing. I think this is not only the case in rural Fujian, but also in rural areas in other provinces.

I have already said above that with the increase in population, births, marriages, deaths, and funerals are bound to increase. The result of more births and marriages is that the old house cannot accommodate everyone, so new houses must be built. Building new houses requires occupying cultivated land, and low-lying cultivated land must be filled, and then it cannot be used as cultivated land. New roads must also be opened near the new house. All of these occupy cultivated land. The result of more deaths and funerals is that the best wood must be cut down to make coffins, and a piece of cultivated land is needed for a cemetery. One often sees a large piece of cultivated land in rural areas, half of which is occupied by graves, making it impossible to cultivate. Therefore, one can understand how quickly the area of rural cultivated land is shrinking! Our country should be streamlined and economical in all construction, and I think the same should apply to the population. Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and Vice Premier Li Fuchun have all proposed "planned childbirth." I fully support this. I think birth control is of greater significance to rural areas. I believe that fewer deaths in a family are better than more births. If the number of deaths from diseases can be reduced, the family will have immense happiness in terms of both economy and life. Our hospitals have "pediatrics" to care for infants. Our medicine is about to add "geriatrics" to help the elderly gain health, work, and extend their lifespan, enabling people to make more contributions. Therefore, scientific progress has reduced infant mortality and extended the average lifespan of human beings. If we cannot control fertility, then the birth rate will increase, the mortality rate will decrease, and the increase in population will make it impossible for the land to accommodate. We have 30 million children of school age who cannot go to school. This is the current difficulty facing our country! If this continues, it will bring even greater difficulties to our country, our Party, and our government. Therefore, on the basis of birth control, I further suggest:

Two Suggestions for Conserving Cultivated Land

　　(1) Promote cremation and do not build graves on cultivated land. It is suggested that rural cooperatives centralize cemeteries and, if there are mountains nearby, concentrate them on the mountains. In any case, do not scatter burials. Oppose building large tombs. We must learn from India's Gandhi, cremate the body, and scatter the ashes in rivers or on the coast to be blown away by the wind. If we want to commemorate the dead who have contributed to the country and the people, we can establish memorial halls or martyrs' halls for centralized commendation, without building tombs.

　　(2) Implement rural construction plans. Now that rural areas have been basically collectivized, there is even greater need for systematic construction plans. There should be certain arrangements for farmers' residences, education, entertainment, offices, gatherings, warehouses, sideline occupations, etc. Avoid farmers' houses being scattered and disorganized, presenting a state of anarchy. Because if a large piece of cultivated land has a residential house built in the middle, not only will the house occupy cultivated land, but the roads and courtyards in front of and behind it will also occupy cultivated land, and because of the trampling of pigs and sheep, and the trampling of chickens and ducks, the cultivated land around the residence will also be affected, and will not become high-quality cultivated land. Therefore, unplanned construction of houses in rural areas has a great impact.

In 1956, our country suffered relatively large natural disasters. There were wind disasters, rain disasters, drought disasters, and flood disasters across the country, but the grain harvest was still 20 billion catties (including soybeans) more than the bumper harvest of 1955. This eloquently proves the superiority of collectivization. This year, our Party and the Central Government made preparations as early as early spring, mobilizing farmers across the country to pay attention to increasing production and practicing economy in agriculture. The relevant government departments have convened the National Agricultural Labor Model Representatives Conference and held the largest-ever national agricultural exhibition. Our People's Daily has also recently continuously issued editorials on increasing production and practicing economy in agriculture, calling on farmers across the country to pay attention to this aspect and instructing them to appropriately control fertility. I firmly believe that under the correct leadership of our Party and government, with the strong support of industry for agriculture, and with the active efforts of farmers across the country, we will certainly be able to achieve a year of universal bumper harvest this year.

The above are my personal opinions. If there are any incorrect points, please correct me.

    节约耕地　提高单位面积产量
    侯德榜建议提倡火葬并进行农村建设计划
    我完全拥护名誉主席毛主席的指示和主席周总理访问十一国的报告，并同意李富春副总理关于第二个五年计划建议的说明，及陈叔通副主席的常务委员会的工作报告。
    在这一次会议上，大家共聚一堂，提供意见，讨论国家“增产节约”问题，是难得的机会。我国社会主义建设应该是依靠人民增产节约来积累资金，支付各项建设的投资。尤其是今年1957年是第一个五年计划的最后一年，它能够总结五年的经验，并准备好第二个五年计划的工作。
    农业是国家建设资金的重要来源
    在解放以前，反动政权搜刮人民，没有进行建设。即稍有建设，便借外债。引狼入室，使帝国主义者加紧侵略中国。解放以后，反动政权被推翻了，人民当家作主了，摆脱了帝国主义者的侵略，依靠自己力量来进行建设。我国资金积累来源有二：一由工业增产节约，一由农业增产节约。工业利润主要是由轻工业来，而轻工业是与农业分不开的。轻工业的原料来源有90％是从农业来，轻工业的产品有70％销售在农村里。换取国外机器的外汇也需要农产品，因为75％出口物资，是农业产品与副业产品。所以归根结蒂，资金积累的来源，主要还是靠着农业。所以我们党和政府重视农业方面的增产节约，是完全正确的。
    农业增产正如邓子恢副总理在全国农业劳模代表大会上所指示，要扩大耕地面积和提高单位面积产量两方面。依我个人体会，中国不像苏联，不可能有大规模的开垦，因为苏联可耕之地比我国大若干倍，而人口只有我国三分之一。我国空旷之地主要在西北西南，但又须结合保护土壤，避免水土流失，来逐步作有计划的垦荒，而又须保留一部分土地作为饲畜草地。所以扩大耕地面积在我国只能在有限制的条件下进行。因此，我们有必要在已有的耕地上节约，提高单位面积产量，更重要的是保持和发挥已有耕地的面积。兹简单分析如下：
      （1）提高单位面积生产要靠肥料。目前我国化学肥料的生产尚不及供应，只有靠农民积肥，不论绿肥、畜肥或沟洫底下淤泥，农民已在积极做了，且也很有成绩。我们更要用科学方法，研究肥料与土壤的关系，充分发挥其肥效。
      （2）兴修水利。尽管有肥料，农作物无水不长。所以要修渠打井。国家已在大力为农村兴修水利；我们农业生产合作社也在进行；国家乡村干部也在协助合作社推动这项工作。这就是农业的基本建设方面工作。
      （3）增加复种面积。这就是增加一年中农田收成次数。北方农田一般是一熟；南方是两熟；福建、广东、海南岛经常有三熟。一熟的可另种杂粮一熟，变为两熟；两熟的可夹种及调整播种季节，至少可以做到两年五熟。这是不难的。主要的是有足够肥料，使收成次数增加，不影响每熟收成的数量。
      （4）消灭病虫害。小麦、水稻都有枯萎病，使结实不好。棉花有蚜虫、红蜘蛛；水果有蛀虫；旱地有蝗蝻。这都需要农药。但是我国农药生产还落后于需要，只有靠农民用人工扑灭或拣去带虫的种籽，去消除或减少病虫害。
      （5）改进农业技术。这就是选种、育种，精耕细作，移种密植，翻起地下新土壤（深耕），推广新式农具和先进经验，来提高单位面积生产力。我们的拖拉机供应不能满足要求，故依靠拖拉机深耕目前是不现实的。
    此外，我们农民要遵照国家农村经济的指标，尽可能选择高产量作物，如水稻、玉米、山薯等，并改旱田为水田，但也要遵照国家对经济作物的要求，来满足棉花、油类等作物的需要。
    农村人口迅速增加，现有耕地面积在缩小
    以上各项都是行之有效的方法，我们农民已在做，我就不多谈了。我要谈保持已有耕地面积这一方面。我要从农村耕地与农民人口的增加的关系来谈一谈。因为人口增加，就不免使生、婚、死、葬都频繁了。我是生长在福建省一个农村中的。我每隔若干年，曾回到乡村老家看一看。最引我注意的是乡间人口一次比一次增多，表现在房屋大大增多，耕地面积大大减少。不但房地占了耕地，而出入道路、屋前屋后埕地，也占了耕地。我下了一个结论：农村耕地面积与农村人口成反比例。这是一件惊人的事。我想这不但福建乡村这样，其他各省的乡村也是这样的。
    我上面已说：人口增加，生、婚、死、葬诸事都不免增加了。生婚多的结果，就是使老家住不下，要盖新屋。盖新屋就要占用耕地，耕地洼还要填高，以后就不能用做耕地了。新屋附近也要开辟出入的新路。这都是占用耕地的。死葬多的结果，就是要采伐最上等的木料来做棺材，而且需要一块耕地来做墓地。每见乡村一大块耕地，有一半被坟墓占用了，不能耕种。因此，可以理解如何农村耕地缩小的这样快！我们国家对一切建设要精简节约，我以为对人口也同样地要精简节约。毛主席、周总理、李富春副总理都提出“有计划的生育”。我完全拥护。我以为节育对农村是有更大意义的。我认为一家之中，多生不如少死。一家之人如果减少疾病死亡，这个家庭无论在经济方面，在生活方面，都有莫大幸福的。我们医院有“小儿科”，保育婴孩。我们医学快要添了“老年科”，就是帮助老年人获得健康，可以工作，延长其寿命，使人有更多的贡献。所以科学进步，减少了婴孩死亡率，也延长人类平均寿命。如果不能掌握生育，则出生率加高，死亡率降低，人口的增加将使土地无法容纳。我们有三千万小孩到了上学年龄不能上学。这就是我们国家当前的困难！长此以往，势将更给我们国家、我们党、我们政府带来更大的困难。所以在节育的基础上，我更建议：
    节约耕地的两点建议
      （1）提倡火葬，不要在耕地上建造坟墓。建议农村合作社集中墓地，附近有山集中在山地。无论如何不要散葬。反对建造大坟墓。要学习印度甘地，火葬后，将骨灰散在河流上或海边随风飘去。若为对国家人民有贡献的死者留纪念，可以建立纪念祠或烈士馆，集中表扬，不用造墓。
      （2）进行农村建设计划。现在农村已基本上合作化了，更需要有系统的建设计划。对农民的住居、教育、娱乐、办公、集会、仓库、副业等等都应有一定的布置。避免农民房屋错综散乱，呈无政府状态。因为若一片大耕地，中间建了一个居屋，则不但房屋占了耕地，出入道路，前后埕地，都占了耕地，而且因有猪羊的践踏，鸡鸭的糟塌，居屋四围的耕地也受了影响，不成为上等耕地了。所以农村无计划地建造房屋关系极大。
    1956年我们国家受到天灾比较大的。全国各地有风灾、雨灾、旱灾、水灾，而粮食仍比1955年丰收的一年，多了二百亿斤（包括大豆在内）。这雄辩地证明了合作化的优越性。今年我们党和中央政府就早在初春，做了准备，动员全国农民，重视农业增产节约。政府有关部门已召开全国农业劳模代表大会，又举行了全国最大规模的农业展览会。我们人民日报近来也不断地发出关于农业增产节约的社论，号召全国农民重视这一方面，并指示适当地节制生育。我深深相信，我们在党与政府的正确领导下，在工业正大力支援农业的条件下，在全国农民的积极努力下，今年全国一定能够实现普遍大丰收的一年。
    以上是我个人的管见。有不正确之处，请求诸位指正。
