    Dong Folk Pipa Song
    Yuan Ji

    In the Dong villages of Sanjiang and the Greater Miao Mountains, besides the lusheng, there are many solo musical instruments, among which the pipa is most loved by the masses. The Dong people call songs accompanied by the pipa "Pipa Songs."

    The Dong pipa is similar to the pipa we commonly see, but it is mostly self-made, generally with two strings, but also with four or three strings. The timbre of this instrument is low and沉(chen)闷(men), but it is very charming, gentle and touching, and is very suitable for accompanying lyrical short songs. Therefore, this instrument has become an essential item for young Dong men when seeking love [1]. In the Dong villages after the autumn harvest, whenever night falls, you can see young people playing the pipa to find their beloved girls everywhere, and you can hear the "Pipa Songs" they improvise. The lyrics of these songs are mostly composed by the singer according to the melody. Last August, in the Dong villages around Sanjiang, I heard many moving songs that were improvised. One young man who was looking for a partner sang:

    I am going to sing now,
    Girls, please don't laugh,
    Although my song is not good,
    I am singing with my heart.

    How much this young man hoped that his singing could attract the attention of the girls! Another young man who already had a lover, came to visit his beloved. He stood at the door of his lover and couldn't help singing, his singing overflowing with his longing:

    Six hours during the day,
    Six hours at night;
    You are like an embroidery needle,
    Stirring my heart into a mess.

    It is said that there are more than one hundred kinds of tunes for this kind of pipa song, divided into major and minor keys. In addition to the improvised lyrics mentioned above, there are many traditional and touching ones. These traditional pipa songs have a strong lyrical flavor and are full of emotion, often sung by non-professional pipa players. These traditional pipa songs have no fixed version and are completely passed down orally by the pipa players. I heard a pipa song called "Searching for Husband's Bones," which describes a woman looking for her husband who left home. Her husband was conscripted and taken away, and she asked along the way. A kind person told her: "There is a pile of bones here, and it is said that your husband died here." So she cried and pricked her own blood and smeared it on each bone, and finally found the bones of her husband. Another song called "Hexagonal Lantern" is the most famous of the Dong pipa songs. The hexagonal lantern is a kind of colored magic lamp hung during Dong temple fairs. This song mainly uses the hexagonal lantern as a metaphor for life and sings praises of life. The original song has been slightly整理(zhengli) and translated as follows:

    While we are still young and青春(qingchun),
    We should sing to our heart's content,
    If we don't sing now, time will take away our voice;
    Like the hexagonal lantern in the temple,
    The years will make it lose its former glory.

    If the girls in your family are still there,
    The gate must be as wide open as the village gate;
    If people learn knowledge and don't use it,
    The soil will bury you and the knowledge together.

    A blessed girl [2] is like a big river,
    There is less clear water and more muddy water,
    Keep your youth! Girls!
    When worshipping ancestors, I am afraid to hear the old people calling the names of the ancestors,
    The ancestors cannot hear the call of the younger generations,
    Let us cherish our lives!
    Life should be like a pile of firewood,
    After burning, it can still leave charcoal,
    Life should be like a snake,
    After蜕(tui)掉(diao) a layer of skin, it can grow more beautiful skin.

    Girls! You are very young,
    Like a boat floating on the shoal;
    I am also very young,
    Like a vine盘(pan) trees.
    Let us sing to our heart's content!
    I hope I am an "Ooh Ooh Bird" [3],
    And I hope you will become a "Zhao Bird",
    When you hear my singing, fly over quickly!

    Pipa songs should be said to be a treasure of Dong people's culture. I hope it can attract people's attention and cultivate this flower to be even more splendid.

    Note: [1] Shengmei is a way for Dong people to fall in love.
    [2] Unmarried girls of the Dong ethnic group are called blessed girls.
    [3] "Ooh Ooh Bird" and "Zhao Bird" are both common bird names. The "Ooh Ooh Bird" will fly over quickly when it hears the call of the "Zhao Bird". Here, these two kinds of birds are used as a metaphor for the mutual pursuit of young men and women.

### 侗家琵琶歌

    侗家琵琶歌
    元吉
    三江、大苗山的侗家，除了籚笙以外，还有许多单人演奏的乐器，其中琵琶最为群众喜爱。侗家把由琵琶伴奏的歌曲称为“琵琶歌”。
    侗家的琵琶和我们习见的琵琶一样，不过多是自制，一般是两弦，也有四弦或三弦的。这种乐器的音色较低沉，但却很有韵致，柔和感人，极适宜于伴奏抒情性的短歌。因此，这种乐器就成为侗族青年生妹〔一〕必携之物。在秋收以后的侗家寨子里，每当夜幕降临，就随处可以看到青年们弹着琵琶去找寻自己心爱的姑娘，也随处可以听到他们临时编唱的“琵琶歌”。这类歌词，多是唱者按着曲调随心自编。去年8月间，我在三江一带的侗家寨子里，就听到过不少这种随编随唱的动人歌曲。有一个正在找对象的青年唱道：
    我现在要唱歌了，
    姑娘们请不要笑，
    虽然我的歌唱得不好，
    可是我是用心在唱的。
    这个青年是多么希望他的歌声能引起姑娘的注意啊！另一个已经有了爱人的青年，来访他的爱人，他站在爱人的门口，禁不住唱起来，歌声洋溢着他的想念之情：
    白天六个时辰，
    晚上六个时辰；
    你就像一口绣花针，
    把我的心挑得像乱麻一样。
    据说这种琵琶歌的曲调，共有一百多种，分大调和小调两种。歌词除了以上临时编唱的以外，还有许多传统而动人的。这些传统的琵琶歌带有浓厚的抒情意味，情绪异常饱满，常常由一些非职业性的琵琶琴手演唱。这种传统的琵琶歌没有定本，完全凭琴手口口相传。我听过一首叫“寻夫骨”的琵琶歌，描述一个妇女去找寻她离家的丈夫。她的丈夫被拉夫出外了，她一路找一路问，好心的人告诉她说： “这里有一堆骨头，听说你丈夫就死在这里。”于是她一面哭一面刺着自己身上的血涂在每一块骨头上，终于找到了她丈夫的尸骨。另一首叫“六角灯”，这是侗家琵琶歌中最有名的一首。六角灯是侗族庙会时悬挂的一种彩色神灯，这首歌主要是借六角灯来比喻生命并以此来歌颂生活的。原歌稍加整理，翻译如下：
    趁着我们还年少青春，
    就应该尽情地歌唱，
    现在不唱，岁月就会夺去音嗓；
    好像庙里的六角灯，
    年代会使它失去往日的彩芒。
    你家的姑娘还在，
    大门就得像寨门一样地敞开；
    人学了知识不用，
    泥土就会把你和知识一道淹
    埋。
    有福气的姑娘〔二〕就像是一条
    大河，
    河水清的时候少浑的时候多，
    留住你的青春吧！姑娘啊！
    祭祖的时候我怕听老人叫祖先
    的名字，
    祖先是听不到后辈的叫唤的，
    还是让我们珍惜自己的生命
    吧！
    生命要像一堆柴火，
    燃烧完了还能留下木炭，
    生命要像一条蛇，
    蜕掉一层皮还能长出更美丽的
    皮来。
    姑娘啊！你很年轻，
    就像是漂在滩头的船；
    我的年纪也很轻，
    像一条盘树的藤。
    让我们尽情地歌唱吧！
    但愿我是一只“噢噢鸟”，〔三〕
    也望你成为“肇鸟”，
    听到我的歌声就赶快飞来吧！
    琵琶歌应该说是侗族人民文化的宝藏。希望能引起人们的注意，把这一支花朵培育得更其灿烂。
    注：〔一〕生妹是侗族人民男女
    青年谈情说爱的一种方式。
    〔二〕侗族未出嫁的姑娘称
    有福气的姑娘。
    〔三〕“噢噢鸟”和“肇
    鸟”都是俗称的鸟名，“噢噢
    鸟”听到“肇鸟”的叫声就会
    急忙飞来。这里以这两种鸟来
    比喻青年男女的互相追求。
