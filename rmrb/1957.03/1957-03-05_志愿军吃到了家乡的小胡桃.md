    Volunteer Soldier Eats Hometown Hickory Nuts
    Ruan Guangxin
    I am a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers stationed in Korea. For many years, I have wanted to eat the local specialties of my hometown, Hangzhou, Zhejiang—fragrant torreya nuts and hickory nuts. In the past, because I was stationed in the northwest of the country, I couldn't buy these two kinds of things. After entering Korea, of course, it was even more impossible to buy them.
    Since April of last year, when we, the volunteer soldiers in Korea, could exchange parcels with the country, I often saw some comrades receiving food and utensils sent from their hometowns, which made me think of the specialties of my hometown again! But in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, I don't have any relatives. Who can send me hickory nuts? I had no choice but to write a letter to the Hangzhou Food and Beverage Company, remitting five yuan, asking them to send me some fragrant torreya nuts and hickory nuts. More than ten days later, I received their reply saying that they had inquired at the post office about the mailing problem. The comrades at the post office said that they had not received any notice that parcels could be sent to troops stationed in Korea. Although they had tried to persuade the post office for a long time, the problem was not solved, so they returned the five yuan I sent. They also wrote a lot of apologies and sent me two copies of their company's recipes. But I thought, "Why can other comrades receive things sent from their hometowns, but the Hangzhou Post Office can't send them?" Later, I wrote another letter to the Hangzhou Food and Beverage Company, telling them about this situation, and asking them to ask the post office again if they really hadn't received instructions to send parcels. If they could send them, please buy some on my behalf and send them. If not, forget it. This time, I didn't send any money. Not long after, I suddenly received two jin of fragrant torreya nuts, two jin of hickory nuts, and a letter from the Hangzhou Food and Beverage Company. The letter said that after they showed my letter to the local post office, the post office agreed to accept the parcel while asking their superiors for instructions. In this way, I received the things sent from my hometown.
    I was of course very excited to eat the specialties of my hometown, but what I will never forget is the good attitude of the comrades of the Hangzhou Food and Beverage Company who truly serve the masses. I must learn their spirit of loyalty to the cause of the people and better defend our great motherland!

    志愿军吃到了家乡的小胡桃
    阮光新
    我是个驻在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军。多年以来，一直想吃家乡浙江杭州的土特产品—香榧子和小胡桃。过去由于驻在国内西北地区，买不到这两种东西，入朝以后，当然更是无法买到了。
    自从去年4月份起，我们入朝志愿军可以同国内互寄包裹后，我常常看到一些同志收到从他们的家乡寄来的食品和用具，使我又想起我的家乡的特产来了！但是在浙江杭州，我已经没有一个亲人，谁能给我寄小胡桃来呢？我只好给杭州市饮食业公司写了一封信，汇了五块钱，请他们给我寄一些香榧子和小胡桃来。过了十几天，收到了他们的回信说，他们曾到邮局询问寄送问题，邮局同志说，没有接到能同驻朝部队通包裹的通知，虽然他们还同邮局婉商了许久，也没有解决问题，所以把我寄去的五块钱退了回来。他们还写了很多道歉的话，和寄给我两份他们公司的菜谱。但是我又想：“为什么别的同志都能收到家乡寄来的东西，而杭州邮局就不能寄呢？”后来，我又给杭州市饮食业公司去了一封信，把这种情况告诉了他们，并且请他们再问一下邮局是不是真的没有接到能寄包裹的指示，如果能寄了，就代买一些寄来，若不行，就算了。这次，我也没有寄钱去。不久，忽然收到了杭州市饮食业公司给我寄来的两斤香榧子、两斤小胡桃，和一封信。信里说，他们把我的信给当地邮局看了后，邮局就答应一面把包裹收下，一面去请示上级。就这样，我收到了家乡寄来的东西。
    我吃到了家乡的特产，当然很兴奋，但是使我念念不忘的，是杭州市饮食业公司同志们真正为群众服务的良好态度。我一定要学习他们忠于人民事业的精神，更好地保卫我们伟大的祖国！
