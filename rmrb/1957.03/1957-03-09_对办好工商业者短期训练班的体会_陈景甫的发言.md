I am honored to attend this meeting and even more honored to have been invited to participate in the Supreme State Conference, where I heard Chairman Mao's twelve instructions, which further strengthened my confidence in building the motherland.

I wholeheartedly support Chairman Zhou Enlai's report on his visit to eleven Asian and European countries, and I pay my highest respects to Chairman Zhou Enlai's hard work during his journey of over 100,000 miles and his outstanding contributions to world lasting peace.

I express my support for Vice Premier Li Fuchun's important explanation of the Second Five-Year Plan; I also fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the Standing Committee and the summary report on the work of the short-term training classes for industrialists and businessmen.

Under the guidance of the National Committee and the Provincial Committee, the Shaoxing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Zhejiang Province cooperated with relevant parties to organize short-term training classes for industrialists and businessmen in the first half of last year, which achieved certain results. At the beginning of the program, due to lack of experience, we took many detours. At that time, a large part of the teaching methods were borrowed from cadre schools, which were not suitable for the characteristics of the bourgeoisie. For example, writing learning experiences, emphasizing linking with reality, cultivating typical speeches, assigning self-study outlines, and holding exams, all frustrated the students' enthusiasm and initiative to learn to varying degrees, forming a phenomenon of excessive control and excessive demands, which made the students feel apprehensive. More seriously, it brought ideological resistance to future recruitment of students.

I believe that to run the short-term training classes for industrialists and businessmen well and achieve the expected teaching results, we must resolutely implement the "three freedoms" policy of voluntary enrollment, free thinking, free debate, and conscious connection with reality, as decided by the National Committee. This is a policy with great positive significance and effectiveness. Since the second phase, we have basically corrected the previous shortcomings and achieved remarkable results by resolutely implementing this policy. I would like to talk about a few experiences in our work practice:

I. Specific Content of Implementing the "Three Freedoms" Policy

Voluntary Enrollment. Students must enroll voluntarily and cannot be forced. We adopted a method of comprehensive publicity and mobilization, with one enrollment in multiple phases. Students are also allowed to withdraw after enrollment if they wish.

Many capitalists and industrialists want to participate in the training classes, and most of them are responsible for certain production work. Enrolling all of them at once will inevitably affect production. Therefore, we had to have them study in batches in rotation. However, it is difficult to conduct enrollment work before each school term. Taking the method of one enrollment in batches can not only implement the spirit of voluntary enrollment, but also overcome the difficulty of uneven cultural levels. Helping them solve some practical problems such as handing over, taking over, and arranging work before students enroll can also promote peace of mind and voluntary learning. As for allowing withdrawal in the middle of the course, it is precisely the implementation of the spirit of voluntary enrollment.

The training class system emphasizes conscious compliance. First of all, we must try to reduce various systems to reduce rules and regulations. We only stipulated two systems, namely, the work and rest system and the leave system. Except for these, we don't need anything else, and we must emphasize that students consciously abide by them.

Provide appropriate care for elderly and female students, who may arrive late and leave early depending on the actual situation. All extracurricular time is freely arranged, and extracurricular self-study is also based on voluntary and free combination, without mandatory requirements.

Achieve "Five Nos": No investigation of history, no pursuit of thoughts, no ideological summaries, no selection of learning models, and no exams. Industrialists and businessmen have great concerns about investigating history, pursuing thoughts, especially doing ideological summaries. We put forward "Five Nos" in response to their ideological situation, which greatly dispelled ideological concerns and enhanced their awareness and enthusiasm.

Encourage the development of free thought and free debate. In order to inspire students to develop free thought and achieve thorough openness, we also took some measures:

	(1) Small group meetings do not have full-time recorders. The group leader reports the situation to the class headquarters, citing only examples, not names.
	(2) No one can attack opposing opinions, no one can arbitrarily label them, and no one should immediately negate them with a few words. We must clarify the principles and rights and wrongs through free debate, and convince people with reason. Only after most people's opinions have reached a consensus, the group leader will analyze and summarize them. If some individuals insist on their own opinions, they are allowed to retain them.
	(3) When conducting free debates, the arguments of either party should be justified and reasoned, and personal opinions should not be imposed on others with a capricious or rude attitude.

When linking with reality, in addition to inspiring consciousness and not pursuing or investigating, we must also pay attention to not using side evidence, not asking about private life, and not spreading or using them as extracurricular conversation materials.

Implement the spirit of more encouragement and less criticism, and focus on encouragement. The slightest progress of students in learning should be valued and praised at any time. Encouragement methods can be diversified, through wall newspapers, publications, meetings, or material rewards. Of course, students with serious misconduct should be given appropriate criticism. Criticism should be carried out through mutual assistance, and we must maintain an attitude of treating diseases and saving people and being kind to others.

The situations before and after the implementation of the "three freedoms" policy are two completely different situations.

II. Teaching Effectiveness After Implementing the "Three Freedoms" Policy

Before the implementation, students had five fears: fear of a stressful life they could not bear, fear of losing face due to poor exams, fear of digging up ugly family history, fear of writing it into written materials, and fear of being dissatisfied with future job transfers. After the implementation, not only were the above five fears eliminated, but also five benefits were obtained:

Good learning mood. The learning mood of the students is generally high, and the attendance rate reaches 99%. Some students even do not go back during holidays. They are reluctant to leave when they graduate. Group speeches are generally enthusiastic, and there is a scramble for speeches in large groups.

Good for developing free thought and free debate. Every unit's problems are always raised a lot, dozens of them. Through everyone's enthusiastic debate, the rights and wrongs are clarified, the principles are clarified, and understanding is improved. The students unanimously said: "Only in this way can the knots in the mind be solved."

Good mutual assistance and unity. Because learning life is relaxed and enjoyable, and free thought is fully developed, democratic life has been developed. Everyone studies together, like brothers and sisters, and receives the warmth of the big family. The disunity phenomenon of mutual suspicion and jealousy in the past has been greatly reduced, and has been transformed into mutual love and mutual assistance. For example, students with high cultural levels help those with low cultural levels, and advanced students help backward students. Some students who have been quarreling for several years and ignoring each other have reconciled through the exchange of opinions during learning.

Good for active registration. Due to the excessive and hasty requirements of the teaching methods at the beginning of the school term, the industrialists and businessmen who have not participated in the study have produced concerns. Now they have been eliminated. In the second phase, many people have signed up. This time, we proposed a method of signing up once and enrolling in batches, and the registration was very active, reaching more than 98% of the number of students who should be enrolled, and they also proposed to enroll in advance.

Good learning harvest. After implementing the "three freedoms" policy, the students' learning consciousness and enthusiasm have been greatly improved. Everyone has considerable self-esteem, can study seriously, and develop free thought. Many problems that could not be figured out in the past have been basically understood through debate, and such solutions are more stable in thinking, so that they can work happily in the enterprise and play their due role.

III. Implementing the "Three Freedoms" Policy Must Be Combined with Strengthening Leadership

Its main links are:

First, we must unify the leadership ideology and clarify the possibility, necessity, and purpose of implementing the "three freedoms" policy.

We should see that since our national industrialists and businessmen can accept socialist transformation happily with gongs and drums, they will inevitably be able to actively and consciously carry out ideological transformation. This consciousness and enthusiasm is gradually increasing. The fact that many industrialists and businessmen are eager to learn fully illustrates this point. We must also see from the perspective of peaceful transformation, from the perspective of the instinctive resistance of bourgeois elements to studying Marxism-Leninism, that it is even more necessary to implement the "three freedoms" policy in learning and to adopt persuasive education and teaching methods that convince people with reason. Moreover, ideological transformation ultimately cannot be forced. It must be based on consciousness and supplemented by external assistance. All crude and coercive methods cannot solve the problem and have no effect.

The purpose of implementing the "three freedoms" policy is to improve quality, not to reduce quality or reduce requirements. The "three freedoms" policy is positive, a political driving force for the self-transformation of industrialists and businessmen, which can transform the negative into the positive and the passive into the active. This will obviously improve the quality of teaching and achieve the expected teaching purpose.

Only after clarifying the above principles will we not waver left and right, sometimes loose and sometimes tight, or even abandon leadership and form a self-flow during implementation. Only then will we not confuse the boundaries between implementing the "three freedoms" policy and strengthening ideological leadership, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and establishing necessary systems.

Second, we must further strengthen teaching research.

Teaching work should be systematic and step-by-step. The entire teaching content of the period should be arranged in a unified manner according to the students' ideological characteristics and ideological laws. A teaching plan should be formulated to make the work proceed in an orderly manner. Doing so can also provide more sufficient time and energy to research and help solve the problems that students encounter in learning.

Industrialists and businessmen are rich in life experience. According to this characteristic, it is very necessary to teach using the principle of cognizability. In the teaching process, we must go from shallow to deep, from near to far, from concrete to abstract, with theory and practice, and gradually inspire and guide. Therefore, it is necessary to deeply understand ideological situations, collect data for analysis and research, and properly combine and apply them. It is difficult to convince people by relying solely on book theory. Only through debates, large group speeches, and other methods can we bring out the wisdom of the masses, use the language of the masses, the things familiar to the masses, and conduct self-education through personal experiences. This is the method welcomed by the students, the effect is relatively large, and the solution to the problem is more thorough.

In addition, teaching should be carried out according to the students' level of understanding and cultural level. The content of the lectures should be as simple and easy to understand as possible. Different objects and different situations should be analyzed specifically and treated separately, and should not be generalized. It is necessary to be realistic and deal with things as they are, especially in small cities, where small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen account for the majority, which is very important.

Third, implement more encouragement and less criticism, and pay attention to the following points in specific mastery:

	(1) More encouragement and less criticism does not mean abandoning criticism. Of course, it is best to inspire self-criticism.
	(2) Encouragement and criticism should be implemented from beginning to end, and should be timely, not concentrated in a certain unit or even at the time of graduation, which will lose its effect.
	(3) Encouragement and criticism should both be based on citing facts, avoid naming names, and should be realistic, not expanded or reduced, and representative.
	(4) The class headquarters itself must have a good democratic style, and must promptly and actively conduct inspections and corrections for the shortcomings in the teaching work, and be good at adopting the opinions of the students. This can not only improve the work, but also drive the students to develop a good atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism.

Our work practice has proved that the teaching method of voluntary enrollment, free thinking and debate, and consciously linking with reality, as decided by the National Committee, is correct and effective. At the same time, implementing this teaching policy in the short-term training classes for industrialists and businessmen is also a further embodiment of the policy of peaceful transformation of the national bourgeoisie. The state adopts a purchasing policy for the means of production of the national bourgeoisie, and the transformation of bourgeois elements is through persuasion and education, so that they gradually become laborers. This is determined by the characteristics of the Chinese national bourgeoisie - its duality. As one of our students said: "We national bourgeoisie have a political status, fixed interest care in the economy, and the treatment of the 'three freedoms' policy in learning, which really makes us convinced and convinced. The government has indeed done its best to treat our transformation policy with benevolence and meticulousness, so that we can truly achieve personal happiness in the process of eliminating classes."

The above is my personal superficial experience. If there is anything inappropriate, please criticize and correct it. (Attached picture)

    对办好工商业者短期训练班的体会
    陈景甫的发言
    我很光荣地列席了这次会议，并很荣幸地被邀参加了最高国务会议，听到毛主席的十二项指示，更增强我对建设祖国的信心。
    我衷心拥护周恩来主席关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告，对周恩来主席的历程十万余里的劳绩和对世界持久和平的卓越贡献致以崇高的敬意。
    对李富春副总理的第二个五年计划的重要说明，表示拥护；对陈叔通副主席关于常务委员会工作报告和工商业者短期讲习班工作的总结报告也完全表示同意。
    浙江省绍兴市政协委员会在全国委员会和省委员会的指导下与有关方面配合于去年上半年举办了工商业者短期讲习班，获得了一定的成就。在开办之初，由于缺少经验走了不少弯路，当时的教学方法有很大部分是从干部学校那里搬来的，不能适合资产阶级的特点，如写学习心得、强调联系实际、培养典型发言、布置自学提纲、举行考试等等，都在不同程度上挫折了学员学习的自觉性和积极性，形成了掌握过严、要求过高的现象，使学员产生了思想顾虑，更严重的对今后招收学员带来思想阻力。
    我认为要办好工商业者短期讲习班，达到预期的教学效果，必须坚决贯彻全国委员会所决定的自愿入学，自由思考，自由辩论和自觉联系实际的“三自”方针。这是个有很大积极意义和行之有效的方针，我们从第二期起由于坚决地贯彻这个方针，基本上纠正了以往的缺点，并取得显著的效果。兹谈谈在工作实践中的几点体会：
    一、贯彻“三自”方针的具体内容
    自愿入学。学员入学必须出于自愿，不能勉强，我们采取了全面宣传动员，一次招生分期入学的办法。入学后如果要求退学也是允许的。
    资本主义工商业者要参加讲习班学习的人数很多，他们大都担负着一定的生产工作，全部一次入学，势必会影响生产，所以只好分批轮流学习，但要在每次开学前做一次招生工作，倒有许多困难，采取一次招生分批入学，既能贯彻自愿入学精神，又可克服文化水平高低不一的困难，在学员入学前帮助他们解决些交代、接替、安排工作等实际问题，也能促使安心自愿学习。至于中途可以允许退学，正是贯彻自愿入学的精神。
    讲习班制度，强调自觉遵守。首先要尽量减少各种制度，以减少清规戒律，我们只规定了两项制度，即作息和请假制度，除此以外就都不要，并须强调学员自觉遵守。
    对年老、妇女学员给予适当照顾，可以根据实际情况迟到早退。凡是课外时间，一律自由支配，课余自学也根据自愿自由结合，不作硬性规定。
    做到“五不”：不查历史，不追思想，不搞思想总结，不评选学习模范，不举行考试。工商业者对查历史追思想特别是搞思想总结是有很大顾虑的，我们提出“五不”是针对他们的思想情况，这就大大地解除思想顾虑，增强了自觉性和积极性。
    鼓励发挥自由思想，开展自由辩论。为了启发学员发挥自由思想达到彻底敞开，我们还采取了一些措施：
      （1）小组会不设专职记录员，组长向班部汇报情况，只举事例，不指姓名。
      （2）对反面意见任何人不能打击，不能乱扣帽子，也不要马上三言两语加以否定，要通过自由辩论讲清道理，辩清是非，以理服人，在大多人意见取得了统一后，才由组长加以分析归纳，如有个别人坚持自己的意见，也允许保留。
      （3）在开展自由争论时，任何一方的论点，都应持之有理，不得意气用事或以粗暴态度把个人意见强加于人。
    在联系实际时，除启发自觉不追不查外，还须注意不作旁证，不过问私生活，不外传或作课余的谈话资料。
    贯彻多鼓励少批评并以鼓励为主的精神。学员在学习中的点滴进步，应受重视，并随时予以表扬，鼓励方法可运用多样化，通过墙报、刊物、会议或物质奖励等。当然，学员有严重的不良行为，应给予适当的批评，批评采取相互帮助的办法，必须抱着治病救人与人为善的态度。
    在“三自”方针贯彻前后是二种截然不同的情况。
    二、贯彻“三自”方针后的教学效果
    贯彻前学员有这样五怕：怕生活紧张吃不消，怕考试不好失面子，怕挖丑恶的起家史，怕写成书面当材料，怕今后调动职务不称心。贯彻以后，不仅上面所说五怕消除了，而且得到了五个好处：
    学习情绪好。学员的学习情绪普遍高涨，出勤率达到99％，有的学员连休假日也不回去了，到结业时还依依不舍，小组发言普遍热烈，大组发言出现争先恐后的情况。
    发挥自由思想，开展自由辩论好。每一单元问题总是提得很多，有几十条，通过大家热烈的争论，辩明了是非，讲清了道理，提高了认识，学员们一致说：“只有这样才能解决思想的疙瘩”。
    互助团结好。由于学习生活轻松愉快，自由思想充分发挥，从而民主生活得到了开展，大家在一道学习，如同兄弟姊妹一样，受到了大家庭的温暖，过去相互猜忌，相互嫉妒的不团结现象大大减少，进而变为相互友爱、相互帮助。如文化高的学员帮助文化低的，先进的帮助后进的，有的学员本来几年来大家闹着意气互不理睬，通过在学习时交换意见就重新和好。
    报名踊跃好。由于在开学之初教学方法上有过高过急的要求，以致使没有参加过学习的工商业者，产生了顾虑，现在消除了，在第二期还未结束，就有好些人来报名了，此次我们提出一次报名分批入学的办法，前来报名的很踊跃，竟达到应入学人数的98％以上，并还纷纷提出要提前入学。
    学习收获好。贯彻“三自”方针后，学员的学习自觉性和积极性有很大提高，大家都有相当自尊心，能认真学习，发挥自由思想，许多过去搞不清的问题，通过争论基本上是弄懂了，而且这样的解决，在思想上较为稳固，这样就能在企业中愉快地工作，发挥应有的作用。
    三、贯彻“三自”方针必须与加强领导工作相结合
    其主要环节为：
    首先，要统一领导思想，明确贯彻“三自”方针的可能性、必要性和目的性。
    我们应当看到我国民族工商业者既然能敲锣打鼓兴高采烈地接受社会主义改造，也必然能够踊跃地自觉地进行思想改造，这种自觉性和积极性正在逐步增长，从许多工商业者迫切要求学习，就充分说明了这一点。我们还须从和平改造来看、从资产阶级分子学习马列主义有本能性的抵触情绪来看，觉得在学习中贯彻“三自”方针及采取说服教育以理服人的教学方法就更有必要，何况思想改造归根结蒂是不能勉强的，必须以自觉为主外援为辅，一切粗暴强迫的方法都是不能解决问题的，没有效果的。
    贯彻“三自”方针的目的是为了提高质量，不是降低质量、降低要求。而“三自”方针是积极的，是推动工商业者自我改造的政治动力，能化消极为积极，化被动为主动。这样显然能提高教学质量，达到预期的教学目的。
    只有明确以上道理后，才不会在贯彻时左右摇摆，时松时紧，甚至放弃领导形成自流，才不会把贯彻“三自”方针与加强思想领导、开展批评与自我批评以及建立必要的制度之间的界线混淆起来。
    其次，要进一步加强教学研究工作。
    教学工作要做到有系统有步骤，要把全期教学内容，根据学员的思想特点、思想规律作一统筹安排。制订一个教学方案，使工作有条不紊地进行，这样做并且能在教学过程中有更充分的时间与精力来研究，帮助解决学员们在学习中所发生的问题。
    工商业者是富有生活经验的，根据这个特点，运用可知性的原则进行施教是很必要的。在教学过程中，要由浅及深，由近及远，由具体到抽象，要有理论有实际，逐步启发诱导。因此，必须深入了解思想情况，搜集资料加以分析研究，妥善地结合运用，单靠书本理论还是难以使人信服的。只有通过争辩、大组发言等方法，来发挥群众的智慧，运用群众的语言、群众所熟悉的事物，以现身说法来进行自我教育，这是学员所欢迎的方法，效果也比较大，解决问题也较深透。
    此外，要根据学员的理解程度和文化水平来进行施教。讲课内容力求深入浅出、通俗易懂，不同对象、不同情况，要具体分析，分别对待，不能一概而论，做到实事求是，就事论事，特别是小城市，中小工商业者占多数，这点就很重要了。
    再次，贯彻多鼓励少批评，在具体掌握上要注意以下几条：
      （1）多鼓励少批评不等于放弃批评，当然批评最好启发自我批评。
      （2）鼓励与批评要自始至终贯彻，要及时，不要集中在某一单元或甚至在结业时来进行，这样将会失却作用。
      （3）鼓励与批评均以举事为宜，避免指名，并且要实事求是，不扩大缩小，且有代表性。
      （4）班部本身要有一种良好的民主作风，要及时地针对教学工作存在缺点主动进行检查纠正，并善于采纳学员们的意见，这样不仅能改进工作，而且能够带动学员开展批评与自我批评的良好风气。
    我们在工作实践中证明，全国委员会所决定的自愿入学，自由思考辩论，自觉联系实际的教学方法是正确的，是行之有效的。同时，在工商业者短期讲习班中贯彻这一教学方针，也正是进一步体现了对民族资产阶级的和平改造政策。国家对民族资产阶级的生产资料是采取购买政策，对资产阶级分子的改造，是通过说服教育，使之逐步成为劳动者，这是根据中国民族资产阶级的特点——两面性所决定的。诚如我们那里有一位学员说：“我们民族资产阶级在政治上有地位，在经济上有定息照顾，在学习上有‘三自’方针的待遇，真使我们口服、心服了。政府确实对我们的改造政策做到仁至义尽、无微不至的，使我们在消灭阶级的过程中，真正达到个人愉快。”
    以上是我个人的肤浅体会，不当之处，请批评指正。（附图片）
