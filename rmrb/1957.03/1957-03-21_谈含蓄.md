Title: On Subtlety

Literary critics often say that subtle works are better. Therefore, some writers are very particular about how to achieve subtlety in their techniques.

I believe that subtlety is not an individual technique, but a basic characteristic of artistic expression. Artists want to reflect the essence of life, so they observe rich life phenomena and extract images that can reflect the essence of life from these rich materials. They then fully depict these images in their works. However, essence and phenomenon are inseparable. Essence is abstracted from phenomenon, and the image of essence is a typical representation of countless phenomena of the same type. Therefore, after the artist creates an image that expresses the essence, it inspires others to associate it with countless vivid life phenomena, and to feel images beyond those given by the writer, the so-called "meaning beyond words, sound beyond strings." The more profoundly a work reflects the essence, the richer the phenomena it connects, and the more images beyond those given to people.

Therefore, subtlety is not ambiguity, not a discount, not saying seven parts of a ten-part meaning, leaving three parts for others to think about themselves. On the contrary, subtlety is saying all ten parts of a ten-part meaning, and saying it extremely clearly, but making people comprehend not only the ten parts, but also associating it with an additional five or ten parts. The question is whether the image created by the writer is abstracted from rich phenomena, and whether it reflects a profound essence.

Leonardo da Vinci's famous painting "Mona Lisa" from 15th century Italy depicts the image of a woman. This image evokes very rich associations in us. When we feel she is beautiful, we also feel she is very dignified; and when we feel her dignity, we also feel her beauty. We feel she is approachable, but also serious; when we notice her seriousness, we naturally feel her approachability. She makes us think of intelligence and simplicity; of motherhood and wifehood… In short, from whatever angle we look at it, we always feel one aspect while immediately feeling its other aspect. The author has organized the various characteristics of a perfect woman, in a very complex and harmonious way, within this image. One of the wonders of this painting, some believe, is its subtlety.

Ma Zhiyuan's "Tian Jingsha" poem from the Yuan dynasty: "Old vine, old tree, evening crow, small bridge, flowing stream, humble home; ancient road, west wind, lean horse, the sun sets in the west, a heartbroken person at the edge of the sky!" There are many wonders in this poem, but the main one is that it evokes many associations in the reader. After reading the first two lines, we naturally see in our minds many images that the author has not depicted: smoke rises from the chimneys, lights are lit, dinner is being prepared, families are reunited, workers are resting... This kind of joyous scene sets off the profound sorrow of the traveler written in the following three lines. This is also a kind of subtlety.

Not only artists must evoke more images in the audience's minds through the images they give; theorists must do the same. Theorists abstract rich perceptual material into rational abstractions from objective reality, reflecting the essence of reality. The abstract concepts they express are simple, but they will make people associate them with rich practical experience, and obtain concepts beyond those given.

For example, Marx has a saying: "Theory, once it grips the masses, also becomes a material force." This has aroused doubts in many people. How can theory grip the masses? Some think that perhaps it is a mistranslation, and it should say "The masses, once they grasp material forces…" But if you think carefully (not only grammatically), you will understand the accuracy of Marx's original words. Correct theory is objective truth. People study theory and grasp it, but in practice they do not necessarily obey it, and can treat it arbitrarily, discard it, or directly violate it. In this case, theory cannot become a material force. Only when theory grips the masses, that is, when the masses study theory and obey it in practice, does it become a material force. Therefore, Marx also said elsewhere: "Truth possesses me, rather than I possess truth" (Complete Works of Marx and Engels, Chinese translation, Volume 1, page 7). Naturally, this also has other meanings. How profound!

Formalistic works and dogmatic theories make people feel bland and tasteless, lacking subtlety, which is lacking much thought; this of course cannot inspire others' thoughts. Successful works, correct theories, are those that are themselves extremely rich in subtle thought, and thus can evoke in others' minds images beyond those given and concepts beyond those given. Where their own logic stops, the logic continues in the minds of others.

Therefore, one of the author's tasks is to inspire people to think. And the reader must be willing to think, and be able to think along the author's logical path.

    谈含蓄
    彭鼎
    文艺批评家常说，作品以含蓄的为好。所以，有些作家就很讲究怎样做到含蓄的技巧。
    我以为，含蓄不是一种个别的技巧，而是艺术表现的基本特征。艺术家要反映生活的本质，所以观察了丰富的生活现象，从丰富的现象材料中提炼出足以反映生活本质的形象，于是在作品里充分地刻划这形象。但是，本质与现象是不可分割的，本质是从现象中概括出来的，本质的形象是同一类型的无数现象的典型。因此，艺术家将表现本质的形象创造出来之后，却启发别人联想起无数活生生的生活现象，感觉到作家所给予的形象以外的形象，即所谓
  “言外之味，弦外之音”。作品反映本质愈深刻，就是联系的现象愈丰富，他给予人们的形象以外的形象也就愈多。
    所以，含蓄不是暧昧，不是打折扣，不是有十分意思只说七分，留三分让别人自己去想。反之，含蓄是有十分意思就说十分，而且说得极明确，但使人领会到的不只是十分，还联想起此外的五分、十分。问题在于，作家所创造的形象，是不是从丰富的现象里面概括出来的，是不是反映着深刻的本质的。
    十五世纪意大利的利奥那多·达·芬奇的名画“蒙娜丽莎”，画着一个女人的形象。这个形象，引起我们非常丰富的联想。当我们觉得她是美丽的时候，同时又觉得她十分端庄；而在感觉到端庄的时候，也感觉到她十分美丽。觉得她亲切，但又觉得她严肃；在注意到严肃的时候，却又自然而然地觉得她亲切。她使我们想到又聪明，又平易；是母性，又是妻性……总而言之，从无论哪一个关系上去看，我们总是在感觉到某一方面的时候，又立刻感觉到它的另一方面。作者把一个完美的女性的各方面的特征，非常复杂地而又十分谐和地组织在这个形象里面了。这画的妙处之一，有人以为就是含蓄。
    元人马东篱的“天净沙”小令：“枯藤、老树、昏鸦，小桥、流水、人家；古道、西风、瘦马，夕阳西下，断肠人在天涯！”这里面的妙处很多，而主要的，是引起读者的许多联想。读了前面两句，我们自然会在脑中浮现出作者没有描画出的许多形象：炊烟起了，灯火明了，晚餐预备好了，家人团聚了，劳动者得休息了……那种欢乐的情景，衬托出后面三句所写的游子的凄苦之深重。这也是一种含蓄。
    不但艺术家，要通过自己给予的形象在观众脑中唤起更多的形象；理论家也一样。理论家，从客观现实中，把丰富的感性材料概括为理性的抽象，反映现实的本质。他所表述出来的抽象概念是简单的，但它会使人联想到丰富的实际经验，得到所给予的概念以外的概念。
    例如马克思有一句话：“理论一经掌握群众，也会变成物质力量”。这曾引起不少人的怀疑，理论怎么能掌握群众呢？以为也许是翻译错了，应该说“群众一掌握了物质力量……”才对。但若仔细想一想（不但从文法上），就会懂得马克思的原话之准确。正确的理论，是客观真理。人们学习理论，掌握了它，但在实践中并不一定服从它，可以把它任意处理，丢在一边，或直接违反它。在这种情况下，理论是不能成为物质力量的。只有理论一经掌握了群众，就是说，群众学习了理论而在实践中服从它的时候，这才成为物质力量了。所以，马克思在另一处也说：“真理占有我，而不是我占有真理”（“马克思恩格斯全集”中译本第一卷第七页）。自然，这话还有别的意思。真是意味深长呵！
    形式主义的作品和教条主义的理论，使人觉得索然无味，没有含蓄，就是没有含蓄多少思想；这当然不能启发别人的思想。成功的作品，正确的理论，就是它们本身含蓄的思想极丰富，因而能够在别人脑中，唤起所给予的形象以外的形象和所给予的概念以外的概念。在它们本身的逻辑停止了的地方，在别人脑中，逻辑还在继续着。
    所以，作者的任务之一，是启发人去想。而读者，则要肯想，能够循着作者的逻辑路线去想。
