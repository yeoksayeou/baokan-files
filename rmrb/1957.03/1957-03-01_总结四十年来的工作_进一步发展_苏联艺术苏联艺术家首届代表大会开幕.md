    Summarize Forty Years of Work and Further Develop
    The First Congress of Soviet Artists Opens
    (Our newspaper, Moscow, 28th dispatch) The First All-Union Congress of Artists opened this afternoon in Moscow. Participating in the congress were artist delegations from the fifteen Soviet republics, all autonomous republics, and various border regions and states of the Russian Federation. Delegations from various People's Democratic countries were also invited to attend the congress. The Chinese delegation, composed of Liu Kaiqu, Dong Xiwen, and Wang Chaowen, also attended the congress. During the congress, the works of Soviet artists are being exhibited simultaneously in seven locations in Moscow.
    Soviet public opinion attaches great importance to this Congress of Artists. The congress will summarize the work of Soviet artists over the past forty years and will discuss many important issues related to the further development of Soviet art. In a few months, the All-Union Art Exhibition celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution will be held, and this congress will inspire Soviet artists to create excellent paintings and sculptures.
    Before the opening of the congress, Soviet artists conducted debates in newspapers and periodicals. These debates demonstrated that the role of plastic arts such as painting, sculpture, and applied arts in the lives of the Soviet people is growing day by day, that artists have created many outstanding works in the Soviet era, that art is closer to the people and more rich and varied, and that the vast majority of artists stand on the position of socialist realism. These debates also criticized the serious shortcomings of certain artists and leading cadres of relevant organs: insufficient attention to the study of theoretical issues and the summarization of creative experience, leading to a slight rise in aesthetic formalism; the commandist working methods adopted by individual leading cadres of the Soviet Artists Association, the Soviet Academy of Art, and the Art Bureau of the Soviet Ministry of Culture, which hindered the development of art. People believe that these debates are beneficial, and many important issues will be raised at the congress for resolution.

    总结四十年来的工作  进一步发展
    苏联艺术苏联艺术家首届代表大会开幕
    本报莫斯科28日电  全苏艺术家第一届代表大会今天下午在莫斯科开幕。参加大会的有苏联十五个加盟共和国和所有自治共和国以及俄罗斯联邦的各个边疆、各个州的艺术家代表团。应邀参加大会的还有各个人民民主国家的代表团。由刘开渠、董希文、王朝闻组成的我国代表团也参加大会。在代表大会期间，莫斯科有七个地方同时展览苏联艺术家的作品。
    苏联舆论非常重视这次艺术家代表大会。代表大会将总结四十年来苏联艺术家的工作，将讨论进一步发展苏联艺术的许多重要问题。再过几个月就要举行庆祝十月革命四十周年的全苏艺术展览会，而这次代表大会将鼓舞苏联艺术家作出优秀的绘画和雕刻作品。
    在代表大会开幕之前，苏联艺术家在报刊上进行了辩论。这些辩论说明了：像绘画、雕刻、实用美术这种造型艺术在苏联人民生活中的作用一天天增长，在苏维埃时代里艺术家创作了许多出色的作品，艺术更加接近人民，更加丰富多采；绝大多数艺术家站在社会主义的现实主义立场上。这些辩论也批评了某些艺术家和有关机关的领导工作者的严重缺点：不够注意研究理论问题和总结创作经验，以致唯美的形式主义的倾向有些抬头；苏联艺术家协会、苏联艺术研究院、苏联文化部艺术局的个别领导工作者所采用的命令主义工作方法，妨碍了艺术的发展。人们认为，这些辩论是有益的，其中许多重要问题将提到代表大会上解决。
