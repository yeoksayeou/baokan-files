　　Why Are There Still Many Inconveniences in Life in Some Cities?
　　Fu Yigang
    Currently, concerning the problem that employee housing, public utilities, and public welfare facilities in some cities cannot keep up with social needs, some people often believe that the state's investment arrangements in these areas during the first Five-Year Plan were too small, and the problem will be solved as long as investment in these areas is increased. Others believe that this issue should be comprehensively analyzed to summarize experience and actively take measures to gradually solve these problems based on the central government's spirit of "building the country with diligence and thrift" and the possibilities of national financial and material resources. I agree with the latter view.
    In recent years, the state has paid due attention to the construction of employee housing, urban public utilities, and public welfare facilities. For example, about 64 million square meters of employee housing have been built in the past four years; enterprises have used enterprise bonus funds and state loans to help employees build about several million square meters of housing. In the past four years, investment in urban public utilities has reached more than 1 billion yuan. Thirty-eight water plants have been built, more than 2,000 kilometers of water pipelines have been laid, more than 2,000 kilometers of sewers have been built, more than 3,600 kilometers of various roads have been built, more than 1,500 buses have been added, and more than 200 trolley buses have been added. At the same time, a considerable number of stores, hospitals, and primary and secondary schools have been built.
    These undertakings have achieved great success in recent years. Why do many urban residents and employees still have many inconveniences in life? I personally believe that the following issues are worth studying.
    First, excessive and rapid population growth in cities is the fundamental cause of the tension. In 1956, the national labor plan lacked strict control in its implementation, resulting in a large number of employees being recruited, causing the 1956 labor plan to exceed 1.2 million people. In 1956, many places did not control the inflow of rural population into cities as strictly as in previous years. In addition, the number of students enrolled in universities, colleges, and secondary technical schools increased, resulting in a sharp increase in the population of many cities.
    Due to the excessive and rapid growth of the urban population, many new difficulties have been brought to the cities, especially more difficulties in new industrial cities. Taking employee housing as an example, the 1.2 million people exceeding the labor plan in 1956 alone require about 14.4 million square meters, exceeding the past annual housing construction area of the entire country. Obviously, from the perspective of national financial and material resources, this cannot be resolved in a short period of time.
    Second, due to our lack of experience in building new cities, there are shortcomings of being "too large, too new, and too high" in the construction of some new industrial cities, especially before the second half of 1955. Some cities emphasized the rationality of long-term planning during construction, being far away from the original urban area, scattered construction everywhere. Therefore, not only could the original urban area not be fully utilized, but more demands were placed on urban construction, increasing investment in these areas. Some cities simply pursued urban beauty, not hesitating to demolish a large number of original buildings, making the urban housing problem more tense.
    Third, some new industrial cities did not adequately take care of the needs of employees in the new industrial areas when arranging the construction of various urban undertakings, using more investment for the construction of the original urban area. For example, the original urban area already has many stores that can meet the needs of residents, but many new commercial buildings are built in the city center, while the new industrial area has few commercial networks, causing employees in the new industrial area to go to the city center far away to purchase daily necessities, bringing a greater burden to urban public transportation.
    Fourth, there are still many shortcomings in the operation and management of urban public utilities and public welfare facilities. The most obvious is the low utilization rate of equipment. For example, due to poor maintenance of water pipelines, the national water leakage rate in 1956 was about 10%, and some cities reached 21%. Although urban public transportation is very tight, the utilization rate of buses in some cities is still very low. If cities with lower utilization rates pay attention to vehicle maintenance, improve operation and management, and gradually improve to the level of advanced cities, the situation of tight public transportation may be alleviated without increasing the number of vehicles.
    There are similar situations in urban public welfare facilities. For example, after the completion of the general hospital in Jianxi Industrial Zone in Luoyang City, the existing 300 beds only opened 100 beds because the problem of lack of medical staff has not been resolved; the theater only stages up to 25 times a month, and the attendance rate is only 41%.
    Fifth, the overall arrangement for the construction of various urban undertakings is insufficient, and there are some shortcomings in investment arrangements. In the annual plan, investment in public utilities in some cities is less, which is not adapted to industrial construction; at the same time, there are many shortcomings in the division of investment in urban construction undertakings, resulting in unclear responsibilities of various departments, shirking responsibilities to each other, affecting the timely construction of certain undertakings.
    The central government's policy of "building the country with diligence and thrift" should be well implemented in urban construction work, doing more with less money. To achieve this, it is necessary to conduct a systematic inspection of the problems existing in urban population management, urban planning, housing construction, and urban public utility construction, and take necessary measures.
    In terms of urban population, according to past experience, it must be strictly controlled. First, in addition to having a general plan for the near and long-term population of each city, the relevant departments of the central government must also conduct necessary reviews of the scale and location of enterprises, schools, scientific research institutions, and design institutions established by various central departments. In the past, relevant departments paid more attention to the distribution of newly built factories, while little attention was paid to the distribution of universities, colleges, scientific research institutions, and design institutions. This situation needs to be changed quickly.
    The blind inflow of rural population into cities brings many difficulties to the cities. All cities must restore the management methods of 1955. In addition to establishing necessary management systems in each city, local governments at all levels should persuade farmers not to blindly flow into cities and strengthen the management of household registration migration work. All agencies and enterprises should also strengthen education for employees, mobilize those family members with labor ability to return to their hometowns to produce, and those family members who can come or not should not move to the city as much as possible.
    Urban planning is a new job. According to the experience of recent years, the construction of a new city is an extremely complex and difficult job. Therefore, to open up a new city, it should be very cautious. I believe that in the future, when considering the distribution of new industrial enterprise construction, except for those that must be built near raw material production areas due to resource relations and require the opening of new industrial cities, the existing foundation should be fully utilized for those that can be built using existing medium and small cities. This will not only spend less money and build faster, but also reduce many difficulties.
    Urban planning occupies a lot of land, which is inseparable from the distribution of newly built industrial enterprises. During the first Five-Year Plan, some new industrial areas were far away from the original urban area, which added a lot of difficulties to the cities. In the future, we should well accept this experience and lesson. Except for the restrictions of geological or harmful enterprises, it should generally be close to the original urban area.
    New industrial cities that have been opened up during the first Five-Year Plan should correct the deviation of neglecting the construction of urban public utilities and public welfare facilities in the new industrial areas, and use the existing investment first to solve the needs of industrial construction, production, and employee life in the new industrial areas. The construction of those in the original urban area that are not closely related to industrial construction, production, and employee life can be considered to be postponed or built less.
    Some excessively high quotas in urban construction should also be appropriately revised. The shortage of housing is a major problem in the current lives of employees, but it must be recognized that the complete solution of the housing problem is by no means achievable in a short period of time, and various methods must be adopted to gradually improve it. In addition to state investment in housing construction, enterprises should make full use of enterprise bonus funds to build as much housing as possible for employees, especially to promote the method of self-construction and public assistance to solve the housing problem.
    The potential of urban public utilities is still great. As long as further measures are taken to improve the operation and management of urban public utilities, the existing equipment can exert greater effects.
    Urban construction is a complex job. To combine this complex job into a whole and avoid or reduce disconnection, the construction of various urban undertakings should be comprehensively planned when formulating the national economic plan to ensure the smooth progress of national industrial and cultural education construction and gradually improve the living conditions of the working people.

　　为什么若干城市在生活方面还有许多不便呢？
　　傅毅刚
    目前，对于若干城市的职工住宅、公用事业、公共福利事业赶不上社会需要这个问题，有些人往往认为是国家第一个五年计划对这些事业的投资安排的少了，只要增加这方面的投资，问题就解决了。另一些人认为，对这个问题应全面地加以分析，从中总结经验，根据中央“勤俭建国”的精神和国家财力物力的可能，积极的采取措施，逐步的解决这些问题。我是同意后一种看法的。
    几年来国家对职工住宅、城市公用事业与公共福利事业的建设给了应有的注意，如四年来职工住宅建设达六千四百万平方公尺左右；各企业利用企业奖励基金和国家贷款帮助职工建设的住宅约有几百万平方公尺。四年来城市公用事业的投资达十亿余元。建设了三十八个自来水厂，铺设了二千多公里自来水管线，修建下水道二千多公里，修建各种道路三千六百多公里，增加公共汽车一千五百多辆，电车二百多辆；同时，建设了相当数量的商店、医院和中、小学校。
    几年来这些事业的建设都取得了很大的成绩，为什么不少城市居民和职工在生活方面还有许多不便呢？个人认为以下几个问题是值得研究的。
    第一，城市人口增长过多过快是造成紧张的基本原因。1956年国家劳动计划在执行中缺乏严格控制，结果大量招收职工，致使1956年劳动计划超过一百二十万人。1956年不少地方对农村人口流入城市也不像往年控制的那样严格了。加上大、专和中等技术学校招生数量增加，致使许多城市人口急剧增长。
    由于城市人口增长过多过快，就给城市带来了许多新困难，特别是新工业城市困难更多。以职工住宅来说，仅1956年劳动计划超过的一百二十万人就需要一千四百四十万平方公尺左右，超过过去全国一年住宅的建筑面积。显然，就国家财力、物力情况来看，这是无法在短时期内解决的。
    第二，由于我们缺乏建设新城市的经验，有些新工业城市的建设中存在着“偏大、偏新、偏高”的缺点，特别是在1955年下半年以前更为严重。有的城市在建设时强调远景规划的合理性，远离原有市区，到处开花，分散建设，因此不仅原有市区不能充分发挥作用，而对城市建设也提出了更多的要求，加大了这些方面的投资；也有些城市单纯追求城市的美观，不惜拆掉大量原有建筑物，使城市住宅问题更加紧张。
    第三，有些新工业城市在安排城市各项事业建设的时候，对新工业区职工生活的需要照顾不够，将较多的投资用于原有市区的建设。如原有市区已有许多商店可以满足居民的需要，但又在市中心区建设不少新的商业大楼，而新工业区却很少设置商业网，造成新工业区职工购买生活用品要跑到很远的市区去，给城市公共交通带来了更大的负担。
    第四，城市公用事业、公共福利事业在经营管理方面还有许多缺点，最明显的就是设备利用率不高。如自来水管道因维修不好，1956年全国漏水率约在10％左右，有些城市达21％。城市公共交通虽很紧张，但有些城市公共汽车利用率还很低。如果利用率较低的城市，注意对车辆的维护，改善经营管理，逐渐提高到先进城市的水平，在不增加车辆的条件下，公共交通紧张的情况也可能会缓和一些。
    在城市公共福利事业方面也有上述类似情况，如洛阳市涧西工业区综合医院建成以后，由于缺少医务人员的问题没有得到解决，现有三百张病床仅开放一百张；剧院每月最高只上演二十五次，上座率仅达41％。
    第五，城市各项事业的建设统筹安排不够，在投资安排上也有一些缺点，在年度计划中对有些城市的公用事业投资安排得少了，与工业建设不相适应；同时，在城市建设各项事业投资划分方面也有不少缺点，造成各部门责任不清，互相推诿，影响某些事业及时的建设。
    在城市建设工作中应很好地贯彻中央“勤俭建国”的方针，用少量的钱办更多的事。要做到这一点，需要对城市人口的管理、城市规划、住宅建设、城市公用事业建设等方面存在的问题进行系统的检查和采取必要的措施。
    在城市人口方面，根据以往的经验，必须严格加以控制。首先，中央有关部门除了对各城市近期、远期人口有一个大体规划外，还必须对中央各部门兴办的企业、学校、科学研究机关、设计机构的规模和设立的地点等，进行必要的审查。过去有关部门对新建工厂的分布注意较多，而对大、专学校、科学研究　机关、设计机构的分布问题管的很少，这种状况需要迅速改变。
    农村人口盲目流入城市，给城市带来很多的困难。各城市必须恢复1955年的管理办法，除各城市建立必要的管理制度以外，各级地方政府应说服农民不要盲目流入城市，并加强户口迁移工作的管理。各个机关和企业对职工也应加强教育，动员那些具有劳动力的家属回乡生产，有些可来可不来的家属，尽可能不要搬到城市来。
    城市规划工作是一件新的工作，根据几年来的经验，一个新城市的建设是一件极复杂和困难的工作，因此，要开辟一个新的城市，应该十分慎重。我认为今后在考虑新工业企业建设分布的时候，除那些因为资源关系必须靠近原料产地进行建设，需要开辟新的工业城市以外，凡是可以利用现有的中、小城市进行建设的，应充分利用现有的基础。这样不仅花钱少，建设快，而且也会减少很多困难。
    城市规划占地多，这与新建工业企业分布是分不开的。第一个五年计划有些新工业区距离原有市区较远，给城市增加了很多困难。今后应很好地接受这一经验教训，除因地质或有害企业等条件限制外，一般地应靠近原有市区。
    第一个五年计划期间已开辟的新工业城市，应纠正忽视对新工业区城市公用事业与公共福利事业建设的偏向，把现有的投资首先用在解决新工业区工业建设、生产与职工生活需要的建设上去。原有市区那些与工业建设、生产、职工生活关系不大的建设，可以考虑缓办或少建。
    城市建设中有些过高的定额也要做适当的修改。住宅的不足，是目前职工生活中一个较大的问题，但必须认识到住宅问题的彻底解决绝不是一个短时期所能做到的，必须采取各种办法逐步地改善。除国家投资建设住宅外，各企业应充分利用企业奖励基金为职工尽可能地多建设一些住宅，特别要提倡用自建公助的办法来解决住宅问题。
    城市公用事业的潜力还是很大的，只要进一步采取措施改善城市公用事业的经营管理工作，就可使现有设备发挥更大的效果。
    城市建设是一件复杂的工作。要把这件千头万绪的工作结合成一个整体，避免或减少脱节现象，在编制国民经济计划的时候，对城市各项事业的建设就应该全面地进行统筹安排，做到既保证了国家工业与文化教育建设的顺利进行，又逐步地改善劳动人民的生活条件。
