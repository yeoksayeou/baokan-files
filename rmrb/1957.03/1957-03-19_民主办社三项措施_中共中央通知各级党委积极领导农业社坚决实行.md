Democratic Management of Cooperatives:
    The CCP Central Committee Notifies Party Committees at All Levels to Actively Lead Agricultural Cooperatives in Resolutely Implementing Them

    (Reported by this newspaper) The CCP Central Committee issued a notice on March 15 regarding several matters concerning the democratic management of agricultural cooperatives. The full text is as follows:

    In order to continue consolidating the agricultural cooperative system and strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year, the Central Committee believes that adhering to the principle of democratic management of cooperatives is very important. Judging from the current situation, attention should be paid to the following three main points.

    First, agricultural cooperatives must publish their financial income and expenditures on time, including the distribution of products, deposits in banks, state advance purchase funds, state loans and their uses, the purchase of means of production and tools, cadre subsidies, member advances, the handling of state relief funds, and so on. All of these financial income and expenditures are closely related to the vital interests of all members. Therefore, they must be announced on time (some announced at any time, some announced regularly) to let all members know and allow the masses to participate in evaluation and discussion. The power of control and allocation cannot be monopolized by a few cadres, in order to avoid various acts of seeking personal gain and corruption, ensure the integrity of cooperative cadres, and eliminate members' doubts about financial issues. It must be understood that in any cooperative that does not do this, members will have significant doubts about financial matters.

    Second, the decisions of the cooperative and teams must be discussed with the masses. For example, issues such as production arrangements, agricultural technology improvements, changes in farming systems, the adoption of new seeds, the basic construction of the cooperative, business management, and so on, should be discussed jointly by cadres and the masses. The national plans and policies must be taken into account, and at the same time, measures must be adapted to local conditions, and the local land conditions, seasonal conditions, and other economic conditions must be repeatedly studied several times, in order to advance steadily. All methods that have already proven effective locally must be actively supported and promoted continuously. However, anything that has not been subject to on-the-spot pilot experiments should be approached with great caution, paying full attention to the opinions of experienced farmers. Although experienced farmers have some conservative shortcomings, they have a lot of experience. If a majority of experienced farmers disagree with certain methods, do not act rashly. Agricultural cooperatives can consider forming a technical advisory committee, inviting experienced farmers to participate. Production teams can also consider inviting an experienced farmer from the team to serve as an advisor, in order to fully utilize the beneficial and reasonable experience of experienced farmers, especially regarding the experience of intensive cultivation and careful harvesting.

    Third, cadres must participate in production. The directors, deputy directors, and other cadres of agricultural cooperatives should make use of all possible time to do this. Large cooperatives have more affairs, but it is still possible for cadres to strive to participate in production for a portion or even most of the time. Recently, after some cooperatives in some areas have undergone varying degrees of rectification, cadres have gone to the fields to participate in production, which has had a very good impact on the members, greatly stimulating their enthusiasm for production. This experience has universal significance and is worthy of attention everywhere. This practice makes it unnecessary for the livelihoods of cooperative cadres to be completely subsidized by the cooperative; the cooperative can subsidize only those parts related to time lost for public affairs, thereby reducing the burden on the members. At the same time, it enables cadres to connect with production practices and understand specific problems in production, which is of great benefit to leading the production of the cooperative and teams. To this end, party committees at the county, district, and township levels should also make corresponding improvements in their leadership methods, such as reducing some unnecessary meetings and not constantly summoning cooperative cadres to meetings in counties and districts. When there are problems, cadres from counties and districts should go down to convey and resolve them, in order to reduce or avoid the waste of cooperative cadres' time and money.

    The Central Committee believes that the implementation of the above three measures will greatly improve the relationship between cadres and the masses in agricultural cooperatives, strengthen the unity between cadres and the masses, and promote a high tide in agricultural production this year. It is hoped that party committees at the provincial, municipal, county, district, and township levels will handle these measures appropriately based on the specific conditions of each locality and each cooperative, and that these measures will be adhered to for a long time and become a habit.

    民主办社三项措施
    中共中央通知各级党委积极领导农业社坚决实行
    本报讯　中共中央于3月15日发出关于民主办社几个事项的通知。全文如下：
    为着继续巩固农业合作社制度，争取今年农业的大丰收，中央认为坚持民主办社的方针是很重要的。就现在的情况来看，应该注意以下的三个主要事项。
    第一，农业合作社要按时公开财政收支，　　其中包括产品的分配、在银行的存款、国家的预购款、国家的贷款和它的用途、生产资料和用具的购置、干部的补贴、社员的预支、国家救济款的处理，等等。所有这一切财政收支，都同全体社员的切身利益密切相关，因此，都必须按时公布（有的随时公布，有的定期公布），让全体社员知道，由群众参预评议，而不能由少数干部独揽支配的大权，以便避免各种营私舞弊的行为，保证社干部的廉洁，消除社员对于财政问题的疑虑。必须知道，凡是没有这样做的合作社，社员们对于财政问题是存在着很大疑虑的。
    第二，社和队决定问题要同群众商量。　　例如关于生产的布置，农业技术的改进，耕作制度的改变，新种子的采用，合作社的基本建设，经营管理，等等问题，都应该由干部和群众共同讨论，既要照顾国家的计划和政策又要因地制宜，按照当地的土地条件、季节条件以及其他经济条件，反复研究几次，稳步前进。凡是当地已经行之有效的办法，必须采取积极的态度，继续加以支持和推广。但凡是还没有经过实地典型试验的，则应该采取很慎重的态度，充分注意老农的意见。老农虽然有些保守的缺点，但他们有很多的经验，如果有些办法是多数老农不同意的，不要草率从事。各农业合作社可以考虑组织一个技术顾问委员会，吸收有经验的老农参加，各生产队也可以考虑请本队中一个有经验的老农当顾问，以便充分利用老农的有益的合理的经验，特别是关于精耕细作、细打细收的经验。
    第三，干部要参加生产。　　农业合作社的社长、副社长以及其他干部都应该利用一切可能的时间做到这点。大社的事情多些，但干部们争取一部分甚至大部分的时间参加生产，也还是可能的。最近有些地方的合作社在作了多少程度不等的整顿之后，干部纷纷下地参加生产，在社员群众中引起了很好的影响，大大地刺激了社员们的生产积极性。这个经验有普遍性的意义，很值得各地注意。这种做法使社干部的生活不必完全由社补贴，可以只由社补贴那些因公误工的部分，因而能够减少社员的负担，同时也使干部们能够联系生产的实践，了解生产中的具体问题，对于领导社和队的生产有很大好处。为此，县、区、乡各级党委在领导方法上也应该相应地有所改进，例如减少一些不必要的会议，不要时常调集社干部到县区开会，有问题时，由县区干部分头下去传达和解决，以便减少或避免社干部在时间上和经济上的浪费。
    中央认为实现上述三项措施，将会大大地改善各农业合作社干部同群众的关系，加强干部同群众的团结，促进今年农业生产的高潮。希望省、市、县、区、乡各级党委根据各地各合作社的具体情况，加以适当处理，并使这些措施长期坚持下去，成为习惯。
