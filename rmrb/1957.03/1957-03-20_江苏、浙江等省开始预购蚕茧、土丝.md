Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Guangdong, Anhui and other provinces have carried out silkworm cocoon advance purchase work in more than 150 counties, cities, and special districts. Shaanxi, Henan, Liaoning and other provinces have carried out native silk advance purchase work in 97 counties, cities, and special districts. In some areas where the advance purchase of silkworm cocoons and native silk started earlier, the advance purchase was combined with farmers' ordering of silkworm eggs. In areas where the advance purchase work started later, the advance purchase work was combined with the distribution of silkworm eggs. Generally, supply and marketing cooperatives in all areas plan to complete the advance purchase work by the end of March. The supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties of Hubei Province plan to start the advance purchase of silkworm cocoons and native silk from mid-March and complete all the work by April 20.
