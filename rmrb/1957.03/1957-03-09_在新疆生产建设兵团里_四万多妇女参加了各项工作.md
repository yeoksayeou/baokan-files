In the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps
More Than 40,000 Women Participate in Various Jobs

(Our Newspaper News) Currently, more than 40,000 women in the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps are participating in various production and construction jobs.

　　More than 30,000 women on the agricultural front have played a significant role in increasing cotton and grain production. In 1956, the long-staple cotton high-yield team led by Comrade Liu Guimei of Qianjin Farm achieved an average yield of over 447 jin per mu on more than 70 mu of high-yield land. Comrade Jiao Shufen of the 10th Farm in the Ili Reclamation Area managed 60 mu of corn, achieving an average of over 1,000 jin per mu, with over 41 mu reaching 1,380 jin. Many women have earned the titles of skilled workers and advanced producers.

　　In pastures north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, many women graze herds in the deep mountains all year round. Comrade Tatahan·Mamurbek of the Second Pasture in the Ili Reclamation Area is responsible for separating nine large buckets of milk and grazing 100 calves every day. On the Kunlun grasslands, almost every sheep herd has women engaged in cooking. They climb mountains and cross ridges every day to deliver food to the herding staff.

　　In transportation and engineering units, many women actively work, strive to improve their skills, and save a lot of raw materials. In the 390 nurseries of the Corps, a large number of women comrades are diligently cultivating the flowers of the motherland.

　　In production and construction, more than 2,000 meritorious models and more than 900 advanced production workers have emerged from the broad masses of women. At the same time, women cadres are also constantly growing and expanding. According to statistics, the number of women cadres has increased from 1,500 in 1954 to 3,000 in 1956, and 180 women comrades have become relatively high-level agricultural and animal husbandry scientific and technical personnel.

    在新疆生产建设兵团里
    四万多妇女参加了各项工作
    本报讯　新疆生产建设兵团目前有四万多妇女参加了各项生产建设工作。
    在农业战线上的三万多妇女，在增产棉粮上起了很大作用。1956年前进农场刘桂美同志领导的四人长绒棉丰产小组，在七十多亩丰产地上获得每亩平均单产四百四十七斤多的产量。伊犁垦区十农场焦述芬同志，管理六十亩玉米，平均每亩达到一千多斤，其中四十一亩多达到一千三百八十斤。有不少妇女获得能手和先进生产者的称号。
    在天山南北各牧场里，有不少妇女常年在深山里放牧着畜群。伊犁垦区第二牧场他他汗·马木尔别克同志，一人每天负责分离九大桶牛奶，还要放牧一百头小牛。在昆仑草原上，几乎每个羊群里都有妇女从事炊事工作。她们每天爬山越岭地给牧羊的职工送饭。
    在运输和工程部队里，有不少妇女积极劳动，努力提高技术，节约了不少的原材料。在兵团的三百九十个托儿所中，有大批妇女同志，在辛勤的培植着祖国的花朵。
    在生产建设中，从广大妇女中涌现了两千多名功臣模范和九百多名先进生产工作者。同时，妇女干部也在不断成长和扩大。据统计，妇女干部已从1954年的一千五百人增加到1956年的三千人，并有一百八十名女同志成为较高级的农牧业科学技术人材。
