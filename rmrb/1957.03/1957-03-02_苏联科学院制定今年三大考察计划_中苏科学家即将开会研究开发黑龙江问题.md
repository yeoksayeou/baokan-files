Moscow, March 1st (By our correspondent Li He): The scientific exploration work of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, including the joint Sino-Soviet scientific exploration of the Heilongjiang River, will be very large in scale in 1957. Academician Sherbakov spoke about this massive work at a press conference on the 28th. He is a member of the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Secretary of the Department of Geology and Geography, and Chairman of the Scientific Committee for Antarctic Exploration.

Academician Sherbakov said: The Soviet Academy of Sciences has always systematically explored the natural resources of the country, a task undertaken by the Academy's Productivity Research Committee. In 1957, this committee will conduct three major comprehensive explorations of the Heilongjiang River Basin, the Krasnoyarsk region, and the eastern shore of Lake Baikal.

The comprehensive exploration of the Heilongjiang River is the most important of the three. Last year, one hundred Soviet scientists and sixty Chinese scientists participated in this work. The exploration covers seven aspects: flood control; the use of hydropower; improving waterway transportation to connect Heilongjiang ports with seaports; industrialization using local resources; developing local grain resources (reclamation); increasing fish production; and increasing livestock. This March, Chinese and Soviet scientists will hold a joint scientific conference in Moscow on the Heilongjiang River issue to summarize last year's work and discuss this year's plans. Twelve Chinese scientists have already arrived in Moscow. This year's exploration plan will be greatly expanded. On the Soviet side alone, scientists from fifteen institutes of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and a large number of experts from many departments will participate. The Heilongjiang River is the eighth longest river in the world. The Heilongjiang River basin covers an area of 1,852,000 square kilometers and contains reserves of coal, iron, and non-ferrous metals. In the past, the Heilongjiang River often experienced major floods every seven or eight years. For flood control, power generation, and irrigation, it is proposed to build eight hydropower stations on the Heilongjiang River, with a total generating capacity of 9 million kilowatts. According to statistics, the total hydropower potential of the Heilongjiang River can generate 200 billion kilowatt-hours per year.

The comprehensive exploration of the Krasnoyarsk region will be carried out by twenty-seven exploration teams in 1957. Based on the results of past explorations, the Soviet State Planning Committee has already drawn up a long-term plan for the next fifteen to twenty years for the Krasnoyarsk Territory to develop industry and transportation by utilizing abundant electricity and mineral resources. It has now been ascertained that the Kansko-Achinsk coalfield in this territory contains 80 billion tons of coal, and the Minusinsk coalfield, which can be mined in the open, contains 20 billion tons of coal. A hydropower station with a generating capacity of 1 million kilowatts can also be built in the Maina area on the upper reaches of the Yenisei River. Iron ore reserves of 1 billion tons have been discovered in the Angara River basin. To this end, the Soviet Academy of Sciences is studying the process of electric ironmaking, so that iron and steel can be completely smelted using electricity in the future.

The comprehensive exploration of the eastern shore of Lake Baikal is being carried out in the Buryat-Mongol and Chita regions. The exploration began last year. Coalfields (rare coking coal in the world) in southern Chita, and other excellent coalfields, have now been discovered. Iron ore was discovered and explored in Aldan. The Berezovskoye iron ore deposit was discovered in the Nerchinsk region. The question of using Yakutsk coal to smelt Berezovskoye iron will be studied comprehensively. The current long-term estimates are: to build an iron and steel plant on the eastern shore of Lake Baikal with an annual output of 3 million tons of iron, 3 million tons of steel, and 2.5 million tons of steel products; and to build many thermal power plants with a total generating capacity of 1.5 million kilowatts.

Sherbakov also spoke about the Soviet Union's participation in the exploration work of the International Geophysical Year.

    苏联科学院制定今年三大考察计划
    中苏科学家即将开会研究开发黑龙江问题
    本报莫斯科1日电  记者李何报道：苏联科学院的科学考察工作，包括中苏科学工作者联合考察黑龙江的工作，在1957年的规模非常巨大。谢尔巴科夫院士28日在记者招待会上谈了这个巨大的工作。他是苏联科学院主席团委员、地质地理部秘书、南极探险科学委员会主席。
    谢尔巴科夫院士说：苏联科学院一向有系统地考察全国的自然富源，这个工作由科学院的生产力研究委员会负责。这个委员会在1957年将对黑龙江流域、克拉斯诺雅尔斯克地区和贝加尔湖东岸进行三大综合的考察。
    黑龙江的综合考察，是三个中最主要的。去年已经有一百位苏联科学工作者和六十位中国科学工作者参加这个工作。考察七个方面：治洪；使用水力；改善水路交通，使黑龙江港口与海港联系；利用地方资源进行工业化；发展地方的粮食资源（开荒）；增加鱼产；增加牲畜。今年3月中苏科学家将在莫斯科举行关于黑龙江问题的联席科学会议，总结去年工作和讨论今年计划。现在已经有十二位中国科学工作者来到莫斯科。今年的考察计划将扩大很多。仅仅苏联方面将有苏联科学院十五个研究所的科学家和许多部门的大批专家参加。黑龙江是世界第八条最长的河流。黑龙江流域面积一百八十五万二千平方公里，蕴藏有煤、铁、有色金属。黑龙江过去常常七八年闹一次大水灾。为了治洪、发电和灌溉，建议在黑龙江上建筑八座水电站，总发电力九百万瓩。根据统计，黑龙江全部水力一年可以发电二千亿度。
    克拉斯诺雅尔斯克区的综合考察，在1957年将由二十七个考察队进行。依靠过去考察的结果，苏联国家计划委员会已经作出了今后十五年到二十年克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边区利用丰富的电力和矿物的资源来发展工业和运输的远景图画。现已查明，这个边区的甘斯科·阿青斯克煤区蕴藏八百亿吨煤，可以露天开采的明努辛斯克煤区蕴藏二百亿吨煤。在叶尼塞河上游的马因地方还可以建设发电能力为一百万瓩的水电站。在安哥拉河流域发现了蕴藏量达十亿吨的铁矿。为此，苏联科学院正在研究电气炼铁的过程问题，以便将来在此地完全依靠电力炼铁和炼钢。
    贝加尔湖东岸的综合考察在布特蒙古和赤塔两地方进行。考察是在去年开始的。现已发现了赤塔南部的煤田（世界上罕有的焦煤），和其他优良的煤田。在阿尔丹发现和勘查了铁矿。在?尔钦斯克区发现了别列佐夫铁矿。关于利用雅库特的煤来炼别列佐夫的铁的问题将综合地研究。现在对于远景的估计是：在贝加尔湖东岸建设钢铁厂，年产三百万吨铁、三百万吨钢和二百五十万吨钢材；建设许多热电站，总发电力一百五十万瓩。
    谢尔巴科夫还谈了关于苏联参加国际地球物理年的探险工作。
