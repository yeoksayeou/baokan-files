　　Xinhua News Agency, March 20th. The State Council issued a directive to various regions on March 19 regarding the advance purchase of major agricultural products for 1957. The decision was made that in 1957, the state will continue to implement advance purchase of major agricultural products such as grain, oil crops, cotton, tea, silkworm cocoons, various major hemp categories, down and wool, and live pigs.

　　The directive pointed out that due to the relatively tight supply of materials, the advance purchase deposit issued this year will be slightly less than last year, and the preferential supply of goods in kind will also be discontinued. The directive requires all localities to rationally use the advance purchase deposits, which should generally be distributed to agricultural cooperatives and farmers in two installments; this should both appropriately guarantee the production needs of agricultural cooperatives and farmers and appropriately help farmers solve their livelihood difficulties. The directive finally emphasized that when conducting advance purchases of agricultural products, all localities should conscientiously sign agricultural product advance purchase contracts and educate agricultural cooperatives and farmers on fulfilling these contracts.

　　国务院发出指示
　　今年继续预购粮食等主要农产品
    新华社20日讯　国务院3月19日向各地发出了关于1957年预购主要农产品的指示。决定1957年国家继续对粮食、油料、棉花、茶叶、茧丝、各种主要麻类、绒毛和生猪等主要农产品实行预购。
    指示指出，由于物资供应较紧，所以今年发放的预购定金要比去年减少一点，实物优待供应也停止实行。指示要求各地应当合理使用预购定金，一般应该将预购定金分为两次发放到农业社和农民；既要适当保证农业社和农民生产上的需要，又要适当帮助农民解决生活上的困难。指示最后强调指出，各地在进行农产品预购的时候，应该认真签订农产品预购合同，并向农业社和农民进行履行预购合同的教育。
