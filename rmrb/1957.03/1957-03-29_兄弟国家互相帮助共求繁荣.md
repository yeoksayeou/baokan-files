Brotherly Countries Help Each Other to Seek Prosperity
Soviet Union Helps Vietnam Build Tea Factory, Trial Production Shows Excellent Tea Quality
　　The Phu Tho Tea Factory No. 1, a modern tea factory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, began trial production a few days ago. The quality of the tea produced in the trial is very good.
　　This tea factory was built with Soviet assistance starting in October 1955. The main production departments in the factory are fully automated, and the workshops have dust extraction and ventilation equipment. A power plant supplying the tea factory was completed last year. A road has also been built to connect the tea factory with the highway to Hanoi. A large amount of tea will be transported outwards via this road.
　　Phu Tho Tea Factory No. 1 produces black tea. A second factory producing green tea is also under construction in the same famous tea-producing area, and it will be completed and put into production in mid-April this year. More than fifty technical cadres and nearly a thousand skilled workers trained by Soviet experts will work in these two factories.

Extensive Scientific Research Cooperation Between Soviet and Polish Scientists, Academies of Sciences Sign Agreement
　　A delegation from the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and representatives of the Polish Academy of Sciences signed a cooperation agreement for 1957 between the two academies in Warsaw on March 27. This is the first agreement directly signed by the central scientific bodies of the two countries.
　　The agreement stipulates that the two academies will conduct extensive cooperation in physics, chemistry, technical sciences, historical research, and other fields.
　　The cooperation between Soviet and Polish scientists has been continuously developing in recent years. Especially in the field of nuclear physics, the Soviet Union has provided Poland with great assistance. The first batch of radioactive isotopes was shipped from the Soviet Union to Poland not long ago. Currently, Poland is receiving equipment for a reactor and a cyclotron supplied by the Soviet Union.

Bulgaria Provides Technical Assistance to Help Albania Build Factories
　　Representatives of the governments of Albania and Bulgaria signed a contract in Tirana on March 23, agreeing that Bulgaria will help Albania build a starch factory and a brick and tile factory. This contract was signed based on an agreement concluded between the two countries in January.
　　The contract stipulates that Bulgaria will provide Albania with technical assistance in the construction and production of these two factories.

Soviet and Hungarian Trade Mutually Support Each Other, Raw Materials Exchanged for Machinery, Mutually Beneficial
　　In 1956, 28.2% of Hungary's total imports came from the Soviet Union, and its exports to the Soviet Union accounted for 32.2% of its total exports.
　　An article recently published in "People's Freedom Daily" regarding the situation of Hungarian-Soviet trade pointed out that the materials imported from the Soviet Union are mainly raw materials. Without raw materials, especially raw materials from the Soviet Union, Hungary's entire industry would be paralyzed.
　　The article said that more than half of the materials we export to the Soviet Union are machinery, industrial equipment, and mechanical building materials. Last year, these exports reached 58.8% of all the materials our country provided to the Soviet Union, equivalent to 20% of the total production of our country's machinery manufacturing industry.

　　兄弟国家互相帮助共求繁荣
    苏联帮助越南修建茶厂试工结果茶叶质量很好
    越南民主共和国的一个现代化茶叶工厂富寿茶厂一厂，已经在几天前开始试验生产。试产出来的茶叶质量很好。
    这个茶叶工厂是在苏联援助下从1955年10月开始修建的。厂里的主要生产部门完全自动化，车间里有吸尘和通风设备。供应这个茶厂的一个发电厂已在去年完工。另外还修好了一条公路把茶厂和通往河内的公路连接起来。大量茶叶将经这条公路向外运输。
    富寿茶厂一厂是生产红茶的。在同一个著名的产茶区内还正在修建一个生产绿茶的二厂，它将在今年4月中旬完工投入生产。由苏联专家培养的五十多名技术干部和近一千名技术工人将在这两个厂里工作。
    苏波科学研究广泛合作两国科学院签订了协定
    苏联科学院主席团代表团同波兰科学院的代表3月27日在华沙签订了两国科学院1957年的合作协定。这是苏波两国中央科学机关第一次直接签订的协定。
    协定规定，两国科学院将在物理、化学、技术科学、历史研究等方面进行广泛的合作。
    苏波两国科学家的合作近年来获得了不断的发展。尤其是在原子核物理学方面，苏联给了波兰很大的援助。第一批放射性同位素已经在不久以前从苏联运到波兰。目前波兰正在接到苏联供应的一个反应堆和一个回旋加速器的设备。
    保加利亚提供技术援助为阿尔巴尼亚建设工厂
    阿尔巴尼亚和保加利亚两国政府代表3月23日在地拉那签订了一个合同，双方协议由保加利亚帮助阿尔巴尼亚建设一个淀粉厂和一个砖瓦厂。这个合同是根据两国1月间缔结的一项协定签订的。
    合同规定，保加利亚方面将在这两个工厂的建设和生产上给予阿尔巴尼亚方面技术援助。
    苏匈通过贸易互相支援原料交换机器双方有利
    1956年匈牙利全部进口物资中有28.2％来自苏联，它对苏联的输出占总出口物资的32.2％。
    “人民自由报”最近发表的一篇关于匈苏贸易情况的文章指出，从苏联进口的物资主要是一些原料。如果得不到原料，尤其是苏联的原料，匈牙利的整个工业将陷于瘫痪。
    文章说，我们向苏联出口的物资半数以上是机器、工业设备和机械建筑材料，去年，这些出口物资达到我国提供苏联的全部物资的58.8％，等于我国机械制造业全部生产的20％。  （据新华社讯）
