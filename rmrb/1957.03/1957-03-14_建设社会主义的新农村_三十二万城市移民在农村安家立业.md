Building a Socialist New Countryside
    320,000 Urban Migrants Settle Down and Establish Careers in Rural Areas

    (Our Dispatch) Urban migrants who participated in land reclamation and production in 1956 have already settled down and established careers in the countryside. According to incomplete statistics from fifteen provinces and cities, including Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, Beijing, and Shanghai, this group of migrants totals more than 320,000 people. They are mostly urban poor, pedicab and rickshaw pullers, temporary workers, small vendors, and other working people without regular occupations. After a year of hard work, their lives have been given definite security.

    Party and government leading organs at all levels attach great importance to the resettlement of these urban migrants. Based on the characteristics that migrants lack the means of production and agricultural production knowledge, the vast majority of people are scattered in agricultural cooperatives with reclaimable wasteland but lack labor. Because these old coops have a better foundation, coupled with national investment and loan assistance, problems such as migrant housing, farm tools, livestock breeding, and children's schooling have been successfully resolved. Some areas have adopted centralized resettlement methods, helping migrants establish new advanced agricultural cooperatives. The state appropriately increases various investments and loans and provides some technical guidance personnel so that they can quickly master farming techniques.

    Initially, many migrants were not accustomed to the new life and did not understand production technology. However, because they had the determination to build a new socialist countryside, the local agricultural cooperative members enthusiastically gave them various kinds of help. Many places also adopted the method of master-apprentice teaching and learning, so that many migrants quickly mastered farming techniques. Shanghai migrants placed in Anfu County, Jiangxi Province, learned to plow fields during last year's spring plowing production. Woman Liu Xiuying injured her hand during land reclamation and production, but she continued to work after bandaging it. Now, they have become skilled agricultural laborers and are accustomed to rural life.

    With the increase in agricultural cooperative production, the lives of migrants have been greatly improved. This year during the Spring Festival, 60% of the households in the Harbin Migrant New Village in Xinglongshan Township, Jixian County, Heilongjiang Province, slaughtered pigs for the holiday, and most people added new clothes. Migrant Lian Xingye used to sell junk, run a sesame cake shop, and ride a pedicab in Harbin. His occupation was very unstable. Last year, he worked 360 labor days and earned 900 yuan, living a very happy life. Hu Tongli, 51, used to have a difficult life. Last year, he received more than 700 yuan, which was more than enough for the family's food and expenses. (Zhen Xiang)

### 建设社会主义的新农村  三十二万城市移民在农村安家立业

    建设社会主义的新农村
    三十二万城市移民在农村安家立业
    本报讯  1956年参加垦荒生产的城市移民已经在农村安家立业。据黑龙江、浙江、北京、上海等十五个省、市的不完全统计，这批移民共有三十二万多人。他们大都是城市贫民、三轮车和人力车工人、临时工人、小商贩和其他无正常职业的劳动人民。经过一年的辛勤劳动，他们的生活有了确切的保障。
    各地党政领导机关很重视这批城市移民的安置工作，根据移民没有生产资料和缺乏农业生产知识等特点，把绝大部分人分散安置在有可垦的荒地但又缺乏劳动力的农业社里。这些老社因为有较好的基础，加上国家投资和贷款的帮助，移民的住房、农具、牲畜饲养、子女入学等问题都得到顺利的解决。有些地区则采取集中安置办法，帮助移民建立新的高级农业社，国家酌情增加各项投资和贷款，配备一些技术指导人员，使他们能够很快地掌握耕种技术。
    开始，许多移民对新的生活不习惯，不懂生产技术，但由于他们有着建设社会主义新农村的决心，当地农业社员热情地给他们多方面的帮助，许多地方又采取师傅带徒弟的包教保学的办法，这样，许多移民都很快地掌握了农作技术。江西省安福县插社安置的上海移民，在去年春耕生产中，许多人学会了犁田。妇女刘秀英在垦荒生产中砍伤了手，包扎后还同样干活。现在，他们已成为熟练的农业劳动者，也习惯于农村生活了。
    随着农业社的增加生产，移民们的生活有了很大的改善。今年春节，黑龙江省集贤县兴隆山乡哈尔滨移民新村有60％的农户宰猪过节，大多数人添制了新衣。移民廉兴业以前在哈尔滨时卖过破烂，开过烧饼铺，蹬过三轮车，职业很不安定，去年干了三百六十个劳动日，收入九百元，生活过得挺美满。五十一岁的胡同礼过去生活比较困难，去年分到七百多元，全家吃用有余。  （祯祥）
