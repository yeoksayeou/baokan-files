　　I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao's report at the Supreme State Conference, Premier Zhou's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries, Vice Premier Li's explanation of the Second Five-Year Plan, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the CPPCC Standing Committee.

　　Now I would like to express some opinions on scientific research work and ask for your guidance.

　　Last year, our country organized thousands of scientists and compiled a twelve-year science and technology plan, providing favorable conditions for our country's scientific research and technological development. From last winter to this spring, the National Science Planning Commission has held coordination meetings in twenty-five fields, respectively, and has formulated the scientific research plan for 1957 in various fields according to the long-term plan, the needs of recent development, and the possibilities. This work is only a beginning for us, but it has already made a good start. As a member participating in the planning, I believe that although there are still many problems and a lot of work waiting to be carried out, there is no doubt that it has a bright future to carry it out step by step and in cooperation under unified leadership.

　　Now many comrades are dissatisfied with the phenomenon of each doing their own thing and not cooperating with each other in scientific research, and they demand to strengthen the coordination of scientific research. This problem does exist, but it is being gradually resolved. I recently participated in the coordination work of scientific research in the field of machinery, and I would like to talk about my feelings in this regard.

　　**Coordination Principles, Guidelines, and Methods**

　　Mechanical problems involve almost every department and are relatively complicated. Both the production and use departments of machinery have a lot of research work to do. The Academy of Sciences and universities also regard mechanical research and teaching as a key point. Before coordination, the arrangement of scientific research tasks and forces in the field of machinery was very unreasonable. In order to accelerate scientific research work, the production departments have established many research institutions. Many of them are concentrated in Beijing, and except for a few units, many were established not long ago, with many soldiers but few generals and insufficient equipment. There are also many research institutions in the user departments, with considerable strength, but lacking cooperation. There are more than 80 mechanical teaching and research groups in national universities, with greater research strength and equipment, but this potential has not been fully utilized. Due to the lack of unified and reasonable collaboration in the past, each party initially proposed thousands of research topics. After coordination and sorting out, more than one hundred key topics were determined. In the beginning, individual comrades emphasized the division of labor among departments, emphasized assigning tasks and transferring personnel according to scope. However, after several studies, everyone believed that today the basic situation is that there are many topics but few people, many soldiers but few generals, and human, material, and financial resources are very difficult. Therefore, this approach is not realistic. Therefore, the following coordination principles were decided:

　　(1) Concentrate efforts and break through key points—solve key problems.

　　(2) Break down boundaries, and research bases should be established where there is strength.

　　For people – soldiers should obey generals, and senior technical personnel who can lead research work should be fully utilized.

　　For production – train soldiers and generals from production practice to prevent work from deviating from reality.

　　For equipment – make full use of existing equipment, especially important and expensive equipment and pilot factories.

　　(3) Avoid duplication and fill in the blanks – avoid duplication of the same subject, the same topic, and the same content to save manpower and material resources. However, subjects and topics that are the same, but with different purposes or methods, should not be merged. Do not easily merge or reduce those involving past research work. Organize forces to undertake or prepare for key blank topics.

　　The following guidelines were decided:

　　(1) Use forces from all directions, and pay special attention to giving full play to the role of universities.

　　(2) Release research work downwards, close to the production base.

　　The following organizational methods are used in terms of methods:

　　(1) Collective cooperation – for example, tool casting is collectively studied by people from six units: the institute, bureau, factory, and school of the production department.

　　(2) Organize joint institutions – for example, the First Ministry of Machinery Industry and Jiaotong University jointly established a tool research office, and the design and research institutions of the First Ministry of Machinery Industry and the Ministry of Water Resources for hydraulic machinery are placed together.

　　(3) Merge into a unified institution – for example, some research institutions of the First Ministry of Machinery Industry will be merged, and specific plans are being studied.

　　In this way, the research institutions of the production department can be fully adjusted, some are combined with schools, some are moved to the leading production factories, and some are combined with the research institutions of the user departments, which not only solves the shortage of manpower, but also takes care of the combination of production and use, theory and practice in the work.

　　**The Process of Coordination**

　　In the mechanical coordination arrangement, through the two steps of comprehensive coordination and professional coordination, a comprehensive coordination group is generated, which is composed of responsible comrades from relevant departments (including the Academy of Sciences and the Higher Education Department) as a permanent institution of the Science Planning Commission, responsible for overall coordination; identify key research topics, fill in omissions, and fill in gaps. Determine which research topics need to be coordinated, which units are responsible, and which units are collaborating; another group of professional coordination groups will be generated, each responsible for coordinating one or several professional research topics, responsible for requesting the research tasks of the research topics proposed by the required departments, the research departments propose the research plan design book of the research topics, and conduct review and coordination to enable the relevant units to sign agreements, review reports in the future, check the progress, and coordinate existing problems. This makes scientific research work more specific.

　　In order to solve the problem of duplication and blankness in scientific research work for a long time, it is recommended to establish a system of hierarchical coordination and hierarchical review of research topics. Divide the levels according to importance and comprehensiveness. General topics are only registered uniformly, and important topics are reviewed and coordinated by professional coordination groups, comprehensive coordination groups, and science planning committees according to different levels.

　　In order to better organize scientists from all parties, combine leaders and experts, the coordination group is composed of experts in production, use, and theoretical research, and administrative heads of relevant units. This ensures that the coordination results are not one-sided. These experts do not leave their original jobs, but only spend a certain amount of time doing review and coordination work.

　　I believe that this method is in line with China's actual situation, and therefore it is also a way to develop China's science and technology.

　　**Scientific Research Planning Needs Institutional Guarantees**

　　After the scientific plan is formulated, the most important thing is to formulate a set of specific systems and organizational forms to ensure the implementation of the plan. At present, in specific work, all parties reflect that problems such as data, funding, equipment, materials, and approval and inspection systems need to be solved urgently. Therefore, some opinions are put forward here for consideration by relevant departments.

　　(1) Data—Research work requires sufficient data, which involves confidentiality issues, which are often delayed for several months to one or two years. Regarding such matters, a person in charge is needed, such as a vice minister, to be responsible for checking and deciding whether to borrow or exchange data, and to formulate some systems, such as machine tool drawings that can be sold publicly do not need to be regarded as confidential documents, or certain levels of responsible persons have the right to decide on certain types of data.

　　(2) Funding—At present, many units lack research funding, especially the work that requires production enterprises to allocate research funding in cooperation. For example, in order to carry out model tests of the Xin'anjiang and Sanmenxia turbines, Harbin Electric Machinery Factory could not allocate research funds to Harbin Institute of Technology. It is urgent to make provisions in the financial system to solve this problem.

　　(3) Equipment and materials—At present, many research units cannot buy the equipment or materials they need, nor can they order them. It is recommended that the Hardware Company set up a special department to serve scientific research, and the priority of equipment and material allocation should be appropriately increased. Many items can be solved by cooperating factories and mines. Special equipment is manufactured by small workshops set up by research units, and research instruments or materials are supplied to other units through mutual cooperation (most special equipment in various countries is solved by research units). Equipment that cannot be solved domestically is assisted by the Ministry of Foreign Trade to purchase abroad.

　　(4) Inspection and implementation system for the approval system of key research topics. —In order to ensure that the state controls key research topics, it is recommended that the Science Planning Commission formulate a system for the approval, inspection, and implementation of research topic plans.

　　From the above, mechanical coordination was carried out relatively late, and coordination work has also been actively carried out. In this way, all technical forces in the country are systematically organized on a national scale, and scientific research work is carried out in a planned manner. This is only possible today under the wise and correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. But today is just the beginning, and the twelve-year plan still has a long way to go. Countless works are waiting for us. How to enable China to catch up with the world's scientific and technological level in the main key areas in twelve years, and how to enable scientific and technological work to guarantee China's socialist construction, must be completed by scientific and technological workers across the country under the leadership of the Party and the government, working together with the broad masses of people across the country, and striving together to complete this task.

### 机械方面的科学研究是怎样协调的？　吴学蔺的发言

　　机械方面的科学研究是怎样协调的？
　　吴学蔺的发言
    我完全同意并衷心拥护毛主席在最高国务会议中的报告，周总理访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告，李副总理关于第二个五年计划的说明，和陈叔通副主席关于政协常委会的工作报告。
    现在我就科学研究工作发表一些意见，请各位予以指教。
    我国去年组织了上千的科学家，编制了十二年科学技术规划，为我国科学研究、技术发展提供了有利条件。从去年冬季到今年春季，全国科学规划委员会已分别召开了二十五方面的协调会议，根据远景规划，近期发展的需要和可能，订出各方面1957年的科学研究计划。这工作我们仅仅是开步走，但已有了一个良好的开端。作为参加规划的一员来看，我认为虽然现在还存在很多问题，有大量的工作等待着开展，但是在统一领导下，有步骤、有配合地开展，无疑问是有美好前途的。
    现在很多同志都不满意科学研究中的各搞一套，互不协作的现象，要求加强科学研究的协调工作。这个问题的确存在，但是正在逐步解决。我最近参加了机械方面科学研究协调工作，想就这方面谈一下我的感想。
　　协调的原则方针和方式
    机械方面的问题几乎牵涉到每一个部门，比较复杂。机械的生产和使用部门都有许多研究工作要做。科学院和高等学校也以机械的研究和教学作为一个重点。在没有协调以前，机械方面科学研究的任务和力量的安排是很不合理的。生产部门为了加速科学研究工作，建立了很多研究机构。很多集中在北京，除少数单位外，很多是成立不久，兵多将少，设备不足的。在使用部门亦有不少研究机构，有相当大的力量，但是缺乏配合。全国高等学校有八十多个机械教研组，有较大的研究力量和设备，但没有充分发挥这方面的潜力。由于过去缺乏统一合理的协作，在这次协调初期各方面提出一千几百个原始课题，经过协调整理，定出了一百多个重点课题。开始个别同志强调各部门分工，强调按范围给任务，调人员。但是经过几次研究，大家认为今天基本上是题多人少，兵多将少，人力物力财力十分困难的情况，这样做法是不现实的。因此决定下面几条协调原则：
    （1）集中力量，突破重点——解决关键问题。
    （2）打破界限，那里有力量，那里做研究基地。
    就人——以兵就将，那里有能够领导研究工作的高级技术人才便充分利用。
    就生产——从生产实践中锻炼兵将，防止工作脱离实际。
    就设备——充分利用现有设备，特别是重大贵重的设备和试验工厂。
    （3）避重复，补空白——同学科、同题目、同内容者避免重复以节省人力物力。但同学科、问题目，不同目的或不同方法者不合并。凡涉及过去已进行研究工作的，不轻易合并或削减。重点空白题组织力量负担或进行准备工作。
    决定采用下面的方针：
    （1）运用四面八方的力量，特别注意充分发挥高等学校的作用。
    （2）研究工作向下放，接近生产基地。
    在方式上采用下列组织力量方式：
    （1）集体合作——例如刀具铸造由生产部门的院、局、厂和学校六个单位派人集体研究。
    （2）组织联合机构——例如一机部与交通大学合设工具研究室，一机部与水利部关于水力机械的设计研究机构放在一起。
    （3）合并为统一机构——例如一机部部分研究机构将合并，正研究具体方案。
    这样使生产部门的研究机构得到全面调整，有的与学校结合，有的迁到主导生产工厂，有的和使用部门的研究机构结合在一起，既解决人力不足，更使工作中照顾到生产与使用，理论与实践的结合。
　　协调的经过
    在机械协调布置中通过综合协调和专业协调两个步骤，产生综合协调小组，由各有关部门（包括科学院和高等教育部）负责同志组成，作为科学规划委员会的常设机构，负责全面协调工作；对研究题定重点，补遗漏、补空白，对各单位摸能力、摸工作，订出那些研究题要协调，由那些单位负责，那些单位协作；另产生若干个专业协调小组，每个负责协调一个或几个专业研究题，负责使需要部门提出研究题的研究任务书，研究部门提出研究题的研究计划设计书，并进行审查、协调，使有关单位订协议，今后审查报告，检查进行情况，协调存在的问题。这样使科学研究工作可以具体化。
    为了长期解决科学研究工作的重复与空白问题起见，建议建立研究题分级协调与分级审查的制度。按重要性与综合性分级。一般课题仅作统一登记，重要的按级别不同，分别由专业协调小组、综合协调小组和科学规划委员会审查和协调。
    为了更好地将各方面的科学家组织起来，领导与专家结合起来，协调小组由生产、使用、理论研究三方面的专家和有关单位行政负责人组成。这样可以保证协调结果不致发生片面性。这些专家都不离原工作岗位，仅抽一定时间做审查与协调工作。
    我认为这种方法是切合我国实际情况的，因而也是发展我国科学技术的一种道路。
　　科学研究规划要有制度保证
    在科学规划制订之后，最重要的是必须制定一套具体制度和组织形式来保证规划的实施。当前在具体工作中各方面反映急待解决的有资料、经费、设备、材料、以及审批和检查制度等问题。因此在这里提出一些意见，供有关部门考虑。
      （1）资料——研究工作要有充分的资料，这牵涉到保密问题，往往拖延几个月到一、二年不能解决。关于这类事项需要有一位负责人，例如一位副部长，负责检查一下，决定能否借阅或作交换资料，并定出一些制度，如可以公开出售的机床图纸不必作为保密件，或如某类资料某级负责人有权决定等。
      （2）经费——目前很多单位缺乏研究经费，特别是协作中要求生产企业拨款研究的工作。例如为了进行新安江和三门峡水轮机模型试验，哈尔滨电机厂无法拨研究费给哈尔滨工大。急需在财务制度上做出规定，予以解决。
      （3）设备和材料——目前很多研究单位买不到所需设备或材料，亦无法订购。建议由五金公司专辟一部门为科学研究服务，设备和材料配给的优先权酌量提高。很多项可以由协作厂矿解决。特殊的器材由研究单位自设的小工场制造，并通过互相协作，供应别的单位研究仪器或材料（各国大半特殊器材由研究单位解决）。国内无法解决的器材由外贸部协助在国外采购。
      （4）重点研究题审批制度的检查，贯彻制度。——为了保证国家掌握的重点研究题，建议科学规划委员会制定研究题审批、检查和贯彻计划的制度。
    从上面看来，机械协调进行较晚，亦已在积极展开协调工作。这样开始有系统地在全国范围内将所有的技术力量组织起来，有计划地进行科学研究工作，只有在今天党和毛主席英明正确的领导下才有可能。但是今天仅仅是开步走，十二年规划还有遥远的路程。无数的工作正在等待着我们。如何使我国能在十二年内在主要的关键方面赶上世界科学技术水平，如何使科学技术工作起到保证我国社会主义建设的作用，必须由我国全国科学技术工作者在党和政府领导下齐心协力，和全国人民广大群众密切结合，共同奋斗，来完成这个任务。（附图片）
