Xinhua News Agency, London, March 30th: Half a million mechanical workers in the London area joined the "snowballing" strike of British mechanical workers today, increasing the number of mechanical workers participating in the strike from one million to one and a half million.

　　One million mechanical workers began striking in ten regions starting March 23rd, demanding a 10% wage increase.

　　Today's strike shut down 1,000 businesses in the London area, including aircraft, automobile, and electrical industries. The products of these companies account for one-fifth of British mechanical products. Some companies in the aircraft industry are currently manufacturing for American orders.

　　Today's strike took place after the first round of negotiations between representatives of the mechanical industry's employers and union representatives broke down on the 29th. In this negotiation, the employers' representatives only agreed to a 3% wage increase, but the union representatives demanded at least a 5% increase. The union had decided that if the employers did not agree to meet their demands by April 6th, they would mobilize three million mechanical workers to hold a general strike.

　　Meanwhile, the strike of 200,000 shipyard workers has persisted for fifteen days. Employer and union representatives have so far failed to reach an agreement on the issue of wage increases: the employers only agreed to a 5% wage increase, and the union representatives demanded at least 7.5% (the workers originally demanded a 10% wage increase).

　　The 250,000 cotton textile workers in the Lancashire area are also currently brewing to put forward wage increase demands. The leaders of the nine cotton textile unions already held a meeting on this issue in Manchester on the 29th.

    伦敦区五十万机械工人罢工
    飞机、汽车和电气等一千个企业停工
    新华社30日讯　伦敦消息：伦敦地区的五十万机械工人今天参加了英国机械工人的“滚雪球式”的罢工，这使得参加机械工人罢工的人数从一百万人增加到了一百五十万人。
    一百万机械工人是从3月23日起在十个地区内开始罢工的，他们要求增加工资10％。
    今天的罢工使得伦敦地区的一千个企业停止了工作，其中包括飞机、汽车和电气工业等。这些企业生产的产品占英国机械产品的五分之一。飞机工业的一些企业目前正在制造美国的订货。
    今天的罢工是在机械工业的资方代表同工会方面的代表在29日举行的首次谈判破裂之后举行的。在这次谈判中，资方代表只同意增加工资3％，但是，工会代表要求至少增加工资5％。工会曾经决定，假如到4月6日资方还不同意满足他们的要求，将要动员三百万机械工人举行一次总罢工。
    同时，二十万造船工人的罢工已经坚持进行到第十五天了。资方同工会的代表在增加工资的问题上迄今没有达成协议：资方只同意增加工资5％，工会代表要求最少增加7.5％（原来工人要求增加工资10％）。
    兰开夏地区的二十五万棉纺织业工人目前也正在酝酿提出增加工资的要求。九个棉纺织业工会的领袖们29日已经就这个问题在曼彻斯特举行了会议。
