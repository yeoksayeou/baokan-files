To Settle Down in Grassroots Units
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

The Gansu Provincial Party Committee recently transferred a Provincial Party Secretary, twenty-eight department and bureau-level leaders from provincial-level organs, and thirty-three section and division-level Party member cadres to settle down in grassroots units, to return to their original posts after a year. This practice is worth promoting.

This practice is greatly beneficial both for improving the leadership style of the Provincial Party Committee and for enhancing the ideological and political level of the cadres.

In the past, cadres from provincial-level organs also often went down to lower levels, but the time they spent there was very short. They always had a specific purpose for going down, either to solve a major problem in the locality or to conduct a tour and inspection of central tasks. Once the problem to be solved was resolved and the inspection work was completed, they would come back up. The time was too short to systematically and extensively study the various problems existing at the lower levels, and even if some problems were discovered, they were often not studied deeply or thoroughly. Although there were many benefits from going down once in this way, it was, after all, just "riding a horse and looking at the flowers," and it was not possible to provide detailed and comprehensive assistance to the lower levels.

Now we need to change this situation, to allow cadres to bring their winter and summer clothes and live in one place for a year and a half, living with grassroots cadres and the masses day and night, to seek a deeper combination in thought and feeling. This approach of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee can achieve this goal. After they put a group of backbone forces down to the lower levels, they will have deeper roots in the provincial leadership. After these comrades go down, they will not only have a certain impact on local work and local cadres, but also effectively improve the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee. The Provincial Party Committee will find it easier to understand the situation at the lower levels, study the situation, and grasp a more comprehensive picture through them. There is no doubt that this leadership method is much more in-depth than the "riding a horse and looking at the flowers" leadership method, and it is one of the effective ways to overcome or reduce subjectivism and bureaucratic leadership.

Secondly, the ability for cadres of higher-level organs to rotate to work at the grassroots level, giving them the opportunity to familiarize themselves with and get close to the masses, is of great benefit to the improvement of their own thinking. The Gansu Provincial Party Committee's persistence in this practice as a system should be regarded as a good way to train cadres. During the arduous revolutionary war period, our cadres lived with the masses and established close ties. After the national liberation, many cadres gradually became accustomed to relying on issuing instructions and listening to reports to lead their work, sitting in their offices all day long, and the opportunities to contact the masses were greatly reduced. This has made many comrades' mass viewpoint fade, weakened their political ambition, and narrowed their vision, thus creating opportunities for the growth of various non-working-class ideologies and work styles. To change this situation, cadres are required to go to the masses, to the grassroots, to familiarize themselves with workers, peasants, and grassroots cadres in the new situation, to exercise their mass viewpoint in getting close to the masses, and to exercise and improve their working ability in leading specific work. This is an important method of studying Marxism-Leninism.

To transfer a group of backbone forces from higher-level leading organs, not only must a great determination be made, but also careful arrangements must be made before the transfer of cadres, and the backbone forces must be properly allocated to ensure that daily work is not affected after a part of the cadres are transferred. If no preparatory work is done in advance, then the transfer of cadres is difficult, and even if they are transferred down for a while, it is difficult to persist. Therefore, the transfer of backbone forces must be combined with the improvement of the entire leadership work to be done well.

　　到基层去安家落户
　　本报评论员
    甘肃省委最近抽调一个省委书记、二十八个省级机关厅长、部长以及三十三个科处长级的党员干部到基层去安家落户，一年以后再回到原岗位来。这种做法是值得提倡的。
    这种做法，不论对于改进省委领导作风，不论对于干部的思想政治水平的提高都有很大好处。
    过去，省级机关的干部也是常常下去的，但下去的时间很短。他们下去总有一个具体目的，或者是为了解决当地一个重大问题，或者是巡回检查一下中心工作，等到要解决的问题解决了，检查工作完了，就上来了。时间太短，就不能系统地广泛地研究下面存在的各种问题，即使发现了一些问题，也往往研究得不深不透。这样下去一次，固然有很多好处，但毕竟是“走马看花”，对下面还不能有细致的、全面的帮助。
    现在要改变这种情况，要让干部带上冬衣夏装，在一个地方住上一年半载，同基层干部、群众朝夕相处，求得思想上感情上更深的结合。甘肃省委的这种做法就可以达到这个目的。他们把一批骨干力量放到下层去以后，就把省一级领导的根扎得更深了。这些同志下去以后，不但对当地工作和当地干部会发生一定的影响，而且能够有效地改进省委的领导。省委通过他们更容易了解下情，研究下情，掌握比较全面的情况。毫无疑问，这种领导方式要比“走马看花”的领导方式深入得多，这是克服或减少主观主义和官僚主义领导的有效方法之一。
    其次，上级机关的干部能够轮流到基层去工作，使他们有熟悉群众、接近群众的机会，这对他们本身的思想的提高有极大好处。甘肃省委把这种做法作为一种制度坚持下去，这应该看作是训练干部的一个好办法。在艰苦的革命战争时期，我们的干部和群众生活在一起，建立了亲密的联系。全国解放以后，不少干部慢慢地习惯于依靠发指示、听汇报来领导工作，终日坐在办公室里，和群众接触的机会大大减少了。这就使不少同志的群众观点淡漠了，政治上的进取心削弱了，眼光短浅了，从而各种非工人阶级思想意识和作风有了滋长的机会。要改变这种状况，就要求干部到群众中去，到基层去，在新的形势下，熟悉工人、农民、基层干部，在和群众接近中锻炼自己的群众观点，在领导具体工作中锻炼和提高自己的工作能力。这是学习马克思列宁主义的重要方法。
    要从上级领导机关抽调一批骨干力量下去，不但要下很大的决心，而且要在抽调干部之先作周密的安排，妥善地调配骨干力量，保证在一部分干部调下去以后，日常工作不受影响。如果事先没有做好准备工作，那么，抽调干部是困难的，即使一时调下去了，要坚持也是困难的。因此，抽调骨干力量下去必须和改进整个领导工作结合起来才能做好。
