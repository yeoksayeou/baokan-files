Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 12th: According to Cairo Radio, Sudanese Prime Minister Khalil said on the 11th that Sudan has decided not to participate in any treaty that is even slightly related to the Western alliance. Khalil told Cairo Radio reporters that his upcoming visit to Baghdad is purely a routine visit to further understand Iraq's views on the situation in the Middle East.

According to the Egyptian newspaper "Al-Masa," a mass rally was held in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, on the 10th. The participants resolutely condemned the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and opposed Sudan's acceptance of US aid. This rally was held under the auspices of the Sudanese "National Struggle Front." The conference decided to hold a people's gathering during US Vice President Nixon's visit to Sudan "to explain to the masses the dangers of the US Middle East and Africa policy to Sudan's independence."

The newspaper said that Sudanese social groups and trade union organizations have launched a campaign against Nixon's visit. The "Anti-Imperialist Front" issued a statement condemning imperialist treaties and agreements, calling on the Sudanese people to oppose Nixon's visit to Sudan.

    苏丹总理表示不参加西方联盟
    各界群众展开反对尼克松访问的运动
    新华社开罗12日电　据开罗电台报道，苏丹总理哈利勒11日说，苏丹决定对同西方联盟稍微沾上一点点关系的条约都不参加。哈利勒对开罗电台记者说，他即将到巴格达的访问纯粹是一次例行访问，为的是进一步了解伊拉克对中东局势的意见。
    据埃及“晚报”报道，苏丹首都喀土穆在10日举行了一次群众大会，大会参加者坚决谴责“艾森豪威尔主义”，反对苏丹接受美国援助。这个大会是苏丹“全国斗争阵线”主持下召开的。大会决定在美国副总统尼克松访问苏丹期间举行人民集会，“向群众阐明美国的中东和非洲政策对苏丹的独立所具有的危险性。”
    这家报纸说，苏丹的社会团体和工会组织已展开了反对尼克松访问的运动。“反对帝国主义阵线”发表了声明，谴责帝国主义条约和协定，号召苏丹人民反对尼克松来苏丹访问。
