The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's notice on several matters concerning democratic management of cooperatives requires agricultural cooperatives and their production teams to have cadres and the masses jointly discuss production arrangements, improvement of agricultural technology, changes in farming systems, adoption of new seeds, infrastructure construction, and business management, taking into account both national plans and policies and adapting to local conditions. That is, when making decisions on various important issues, cooperative cadres should repeatedly consult with the masses, absorb the correct opinions of the masses, and should not make hasty decisions or act arbitrarily by a few people.

The Party Central Committee's initiative is of great significance for continuing to consolidate the agricultural cooperative system and striving for a bumper agricultural harvest this year.

An active, fully reliable production plan can inspire the enthusiasm, confidence, and initiative of cooperative members to increase production. However, it is not easy to formulate a good plan. Last year, some agricultural cooperatives set their plans too high, making them impossible to achieve, which naturally failed to promote production development. This year, this tendency has been corrected, but some cooperatives have set their plans too low, which can only relax the members' fighting spirit. How can we overcome this phenomenon of being either too high or too low? The best way is to organize mass discussions. When cadres of the Bailudong Agricultural Cooperative in Chenxian County, Hunan, attended a meeting in the county, they initially formulated this year's production increase plan but lacked confidence, fearing that the members would find it too high. However, when they launched a discussion among the members after returning to the cooperative, they received a completely unexpected result: the members did not think it was too high, but too low. They presented sufficient reasons, stating that on the basis of the original plan, it could be increased by another 10% or more, which would increase the actual income by more than 54% compared to last year. Growing double-cropping rice requires more labor, and the original plan of the Third Production Team was to increase last year's 104 mu to 130 mu, but the masses were willing to work more, so they raised the target to 166 mu. The average planned yield per mu was increased from 710 jin last year to 950 jin. The guarantee for increasing production was based on concrete conditions and proposed to strengthen water conservancy management, repair ditches, and increase fertilizer application. After discussion by the members, the single-cropping rice of the Eighth Production Team also increased sharply from 400 jin last year to 580 jin. The members reasoned that there was a drought last year, and the cultivation was very rough; this year, with intensive cultivation and increased fertilizer application, and good labor organization, it would certainly far exceed last year. In addition, the avenues and income of sideline occupations also increased after discussion. The number of workdays for members, originally planned at 230 to 250 days per year for each male laborer, was generally reported by the members themselves to be 240 to 270 days, with the highest reaching 290 days. After the plan was revised, the members were very enthusiastic about increasing production, and more than 80% of the people worked in the rain during the spring rain. Similar examples exist in other provinces as well.

Reform of production technology and farming systems are the most important measures for increasing agricultural production. However, if such reforms are not discussed with the masses, they can easily lead to failure and cause losses. Last year, many places neglected this issue when promoting improved varieties, close planting, and expanding the area of multiple cropping, failing to consult with the masses, disregarding local land conditions, seasonal conditions, and other economic conditions, and blindly decided to do it, resulting in no increase in production, and in some cases even a decrease.

Agricultural cooperatives need to continuously improve business management, actively and reasonably develop diversified economies, organize labor better, adopt appropriate methods to raise livestock well, accumulate more and better fertilizer, and reduce expenditures to the minimum, etc., which also requires cooperative cadres to frequently consult with the masses and solicit their opinions. There is no better way.

Here, it is particularly necessary to emphasize the issue of experienced farmers. The Party Central Committee's notice requires all localities to fully pay attention to the opinions of experienced farmers and not to hastily take certain measures that the majority of experienced farmers do not agree with; it is suggested that agricultural cooperatives consider organizing technical advisory committees, absorbing experienced farmers to participate; at the same time, it is suggested that each production team consider inviting an experienced farmer from their team to serve as a consultant, in order to fully utilize the beneficial and reasonable experience of experienced farmers. This should be said to be an important measure for all localities to avoid errors in agricultural production and even strive for increased production. Experienced farmers have inherited the rich experience of thousands of years of agricultural production in our country, have a lot of wisdom, and are more familiar with the local soil properties, fertilizer conditions, climate change patterns, and the growth patterns of various crops, as well as other production conditions. If we consult with these experienced farmers when taking certain measures to increase production, promoting certain new varieties, and new farming systems, they will always have some beneficial insights. We advocate taking different measures based on specific circumstances and different times, locations, and conditions, so we should pay close attention to understanding the specific circumstances and conditions of the local area from these experienced farmers. In terms of intensive cultivation and careful harvesting, young farmers should humbly learn many beneficial experiences from experienced farmers.

Before last summer, the Gangchang Production Team of the Shuangmiao Township Agricultural Cooperative in Xiangcheng County, Henan, had not been well organized in production and was always lagging behind other production teams. Later, the captain (a young man) consulted with the experienced farmers in the team, who helped him organize all types of labor in the cooperative—women, the elderly, and young adults—into appropriate farm work, overcoming the phenomenon of idle labor, and as a result, both the summer harvest and autumn planting were done quickly and well. After the Management Committee of the Liulin Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Zhengzhou formulated this year's contract-based production plan, it specially held a forum for experienced farmers, absorbed their opinions, and studied and revised the quotas item by item. Finally, it was submitted to the members' representative assembly for discussion, and the representatives all believed that the quotas were neither too high nor too low, and everyone was very enthusiastic. This cooperative also absorbed the correct opinions of experienced farmers in terms of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily and saving expenses, and as a result, both production costs and management fees were reduced considerably. Cadres in Xiangya Township, Zhangpu County, Fujian, could not find ways to accumulate fertilizer, and later consulted with experienced farmers, discovering six mud ponds that had not been dug for many years, increasing the accumulation of 400,000 dan of pond mud, which initially solved the problem of fertilizer for spring plowing. In Xizi Township, the comrades of the County Party Committee working group encountered continuous spring rain during sowing and raising seedlings, and asked Cai Tiangui, an experienced farmer, for advice. Cai introduced his more than 30 years of experience in preventing seedling rot by soaking seeds in warm water, selecting seedling land, dissolving the soil early, applying sufficient base fertilizer, and rationally draining and irrigating water. This experience was promoted and applied to the entire township, making the seedlings grow well without rotting. There are many similar things in various places. From this, it can be seen that to run agricultural cooperatives well and even better, we must earnestly and sincerely unite experienced farmers and fully play their initiative.

All localities should give necessary consideration to the life and labor of experienced farmers in the cooperatives, such as assigning them to raise livestock, accumulate fertilizer, sow seedlings, or do other technical light labor, and give them a little more work points according to the quality of their work, so that their lives are guaranteed, they are in a happy mood, and they can often spread their production experience and knowledge to young people.

In order to consolidate the agricultural cooperative system and strive for a bumper agricultural harvest, township and cooperative cadres should establish a close, brotherly relationship of love and unity with the cooperative members. To establish this relationship, the first requirement is that cadres have a democratic style, consult with the masses on everything, listen more to the opinions of the masses, and regard the opinions of the masses as the source of all their wisdom, leadership experience, and leadership ability. Only in this way can the initiative of the cooperative cadres be correctly brought into play, and the cooperative cadres can be loved by the cooperative members. On the contrary, whoever does not do this will often spoil good things, suffer setbacks and failures in their work, and arouse the resentment of the masses. Party organizations in various places should strictly criticize this latter phenomenon and urge comrades who have this problem to wake up immediately.

### 同群众商量办事

    同群众商量办事
    中共中央关于民主办社几个事项的通知，要求农业合作社和它的生产队在布置生产、改进农业技术、改变耕作制度、采用新种子、进行基本建设和经营管理的时候，都要由干部和群众共同讨论，既要照顾国家的计划和政策，又要因地制宜。就是说，社干部在决定各种重要问题的时候，都应当反复地同群众商量，吸收群众的正确意见，而不应当由少数人草率决定，独断专行。
    党中央的这项倡议，对于继续巩固农业合作社制度，争取今年农业大丰收，有着十分重大的意义。
    积极而又充分可靠的生产计划，可以鼓舞社员群众的增产热情、信心和积极性。可是计划要订好并不容易。去年有些农业社计划订得太高，根本没有实现的可能，当然就不能促进生产的发展。今年纠正了这种偏向，但有些社又订得太低，当然也只能松懈社员的斗志。怎样克服这种偏高偏低的现象呢？最好的办法就是组织群众讨论。湖南郴县白鹿洞农业社的干部在县里开会时初步制订了今年的增产计划，但没有信心，他们怕社员们嫌高。但在回社后发动社员讨论时，却得到完全意外的反面结果：社员们不是嫌高，而是嫌低。他们拿出充分的理由，说明在原计划的基础上，还可以再提高百分之十以上，比去年的实际收入可以增加百分之五十四还多。种双季稻要多费劳动，第三生产队的原订计划只是把去年的一百零四亩提高到一百三十亩，但群众愿意多劳动，他们把指标提到一百六十六亩。每亩的平均计划产量，则由去年实收的七百一十斤提高到九百五十斤。增产的保证，是根据具体条件而提出的加强水利管理，修好水沟和增施肥料。第八生产队的单季稻，经社员讨论，也由去年实收的四百斤激增至五百八十斤。社员们的理由是去年有旱灾，耕作很毛草；今年实行精耕细作，增施肥料，劳力组织好，当然可以远远超过去年。此外，副业的门路和收入，经过讨论也增加了。社员出工数，原计划每个男劳力全年出工二百三十至二百五十个，经社员自报，一般是二百四十至二百七十个，最高的达到二百九十个。计划修订以后，社员们增产劲头很足，春雨中冒雨出工的人达到百分之八十以上。类似的例子，其他省份也有。
    生产技术改革和耕作制度的改革，是农业增产的最重要措施。可是，这种改革如果不同群众商量，也很容易遭致失败，造成损失。去年许多地方在推广良种、密植和扩大复种面积的时候，忽略了这一问题，没有同群众商量，不顾本地的土地条件、季节条件和其他经济条件，盲目决定去干，结果没有增产，有的甚至还减了产。
    农业合作社要不断地改善经营管理，积极地而又合理地发展多种经济，把劳动组织得更好，采取适当办法把耕畜饲养好，积肥又多又好，开支缩减到最小限度，等等，同样地要求社干部经常与群众商量，征求群众意见。此外并无更好的办法。
    这里特别需要强调提出老农的问题。党中央的通知，要求各地充分注意老农的意见，不要草率地采取多数老农所不同意的某些办法；建议各农业社考虑组织技术顾问委员会，吸收有经验的老农参加；同时建议各生产队考虑请本队一个有经验的老农当顾问，以便充分利用老农的有益的合理的经验。这应该说是各地在农业生产上避免错误以至争取增产的一项重要措施。老农们继承了我国数千年农业生产的丰富经验，有很多智慧，他们对当地的土地性能、肥料情况、气候变化规律与各种作物生长规律，以及其他的生产条件，都比较熟悉。如果我们在采取某项增产措施、推广某种新品种和新耕作制度的时候，好好找老农们商量一下，他们总会有一些有益的见解的。我们提倡根据具体情况和不同的时间、地点、条件，采取不同的措施，那就应该十分注意向这些老农来了解当地的具体情况和条件。在精耕细作、细打细收方面，青年农民应该虚心地向老农学习许多有益的经验。
    河南襄城县双庙乡农业社岗常生产队在去年夏季以前，生产一直组织不好，老是落在别的生产队后面。后来队长（青年）向队内老农请教，老农帮助他把社内各类劳动力——妇女、老人、青壮年都组织到适当的农活中去，克服了窝工现象，结果夏收和秋种都搞得又快又好。郑州郊区柳林农业社管理委员会在制定今年包工包产草案之后，专门召开老农座谈会，吸收老农意见，逐条逐项研究修改了定额。最后拿到社员代表大会上讨论，代表们都认为定额不高不低，大家情绪很高。这个社在勤俭办社、节约开支方面，也吸收了老农的正确意见，结果生产费和管理费都降低不少。福建漳浦县象牙乡干部找不出积肥的门路，后来请教于老农，发现了多年没有挖过的塘泥六处，增积了四十万担塘泥，初步解决了春耕用肥。溪仔乡在播种育秧中碰到绵延的春雨，县委工作组的同志向老农蔡田桂求教，蔡介绍了自己温汤浸种、选择秧地、早溶田、下足基肥、合理排灌水的三十多年不烂秧的经验。这经验推广应用到全乡，使全乡秧苗生长良好，没有烂秧。类似这样的事情，各地都有不少。由此可见，要把农业合作社办好和办得更好，就必须认真地、诚诚恳恳地团结老农，充分发挥他们的积极性。
    对于老农们在社内的生活和劳动，各地应当给以必要的照顾，比如分配他们饲养牲畜、积肥、播秧，或做其他技术性的轻劳动，按照他们的工作质量，多给一点工分，使他们生活有保障，心情愉快，能够经常把他们的生产经验和知识传播给青年人。
    为了巩固农业合作社制度，为了争取农业大丰收，乡社干部同社员群众应当建立起一种亲密的兄弟般的友爱团结的关系。要建立这种关系，首先就要求干部有一种民主的作风，遇事多同群众商量，多听听群众的意见，把群众的意见当成自己一切智慧和领导经验、领导能力的源泉。只有这样，才能正确地发挥社干部的积极性，社干部也才能受到社员的爱戴。反之，谁不这样，他就往往会把好事办坏，在工作上遭受挫折和失败，引起群众的埋怨。各地党组织应当严格地批判这后一种现象，促使犯这种毛病的同志猛省。
