Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 23rd: The Czechoslovak Republic Government Delegation, headed by Premier Viliam Široký, arrived in Shanghai by special plane from Hangzhou at 9:35 this morning. The distinguished guests were warmly welcomed at the airport by Cao Diqiu, Vice Mayor of Shanghai, and his wife, Wei Wenbo, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai.

After a short rest, the distinguished guests visited the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory. Premier Široký and others visited the various workshops of the factory and learned that before liberation, the factory could only produce simple threshers, but in the past four years, it has produced seventeen kinds of precision machine tools. Premier Široký said to factory director Ai Ding: "The rapid development of China's machine industry can be seen from the growth of this factory."

In the afternoon, members of the delegation also visited the Shanghai Turbine Factory, which was expanded with the assistance of the Czechoslovak government and experts. In the 14,000-square-meter turbine workshop, members of the delegation saw dozens of machine tools produced in Czechoslovakia and a 6,000-kilowatt turbine produced by the factory, which was test-run just yesterday. Mrs. Široký presented a commemorative medal to Weng Xiangdi, a young female milling worker who was trained by Czechoslovak experts, next to a Czechoslovak milling machine. Before leaving the factory, the delegation also received a model of a 12,000-kilowatt turbine and a box of turbine blades as gifts from the factory.

In the evening, members of the delegation visited the Sino-Czechoslovak Friendship Room of the Children's Palace. Yang Miaoling, a fifteen-year-old female student, presented Mrs. Široký with a scarf embroidered with peaches, Buddha's hand citrons, and pomegranates, which she embroidered herself.

In the evening, Premier Široký and all members of the delegation attended a banquet held by Vice Mayor Cao Diqiu in their honor.

　　捷政府代表团到达上海访问
    据新华社上海23日电　以威廉·西罗基总理为首的捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团今天上午九时三十五分乘专机从杭州到达上海。贵宾们在机场上受到上海市副市长曹荻秋和夫人、中共上海市委员会书记处书记魏文伯以及上海市各界代表人士的热烈欢迎。
    贵宾们稍事休息后，到上海机床厂参观。西罗基总理等参观了这个工厂的各个车间，了解到这个厂在解放前只能生产简陋脱谷机，而在最近四年多来已经生产了十七种精密的机床。西罗基总理对厂长艾丁说：从这个厂的成长过程，可以看出中国机器工业迅速发展的面貌。
    代表团的团员们在下午又参观了由捷克斯洛伐克政府和专家协助扩建起来的上海汽轮机厂。在面积达一万四千平方公尺的汽轮机车间里，代表团团员们看到了几十台捷克斯洛伐克出产的机床，和刚在昨天试车的这个厂生产的六千瓩汽轮机。西罗基总理夫人在一台捷克斯洛伐克铣床旁，把一枚纪念章送给了由捷克斯洛伐克专家培养起来的青年女铣工翁香娣。代表团在离开工厂以前，还接受了这个工厂赠送的一台一万二千瓩汽轮机的模型和一盒汽轮机叶片。
    傍晚，代表团团员们参观了少年宫的中捷友谊室。十五岁的女学生杨妙玲把亲手刺绣的一条绣有寿桃、佛手和石榴的头巾送给了西罗基总理夫人。
    晚上，西罗基总理和代表团全体团员出席了曹荻秋副市长为欢迎他们而举行的宴会。
