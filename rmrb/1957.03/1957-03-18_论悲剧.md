    On Tragedy
    Lao She
    In the past two or three years, our satirical dramas have had better luck than tragedies. The Soviet Union has provided us with some theories and examples of satirical dramas, and we ourselves have also written some. Judging from the audience's reaction, everyone likes satirical dramas. However, some people don't like them very much: some because the object of satire is somewhat similar to themselves, and they inevitably feel uncomfortable; others, although they don't attribute the problem to themselves, the object of satire is their colleague, and for the sake of collegial loyalty, they have to declare: there are no such people or things in our industry; still others believe that satire is exposure, and it's not active enough, so satirical dramas, even crosstalk, should be banned and no longer waste ink.
    Anyway, we finally have satirical dramas and debates about them. Its luck is pretty good, needless to say.
    As for tragedy, it's really a bit sad. No one writes it, and no one has discussed how it should be written, or whether it can be written at all.
    Is it that tragedy can still be written according to the old formula, without discussion? I don't think so. The oldest tragedies in the world always depict how fate teases and manipulates people; it is the will of Heaven, and there is no escape. Today, we no longer believe in this kind of fatalism, so naturally we will not create tragedies according to this old tune. Later tragedies mainly depict the incompatibility between characters (not villains) and the environment or the times, or the incompatibility between people in terms of personality or aspirations, which inevitably leads to tragedy. Can we still use this method to write tragedies today, or not? We have not discussed it yet. This is only because it has not been discussed, not because it cannot be discussed.
    Is it that there is no tragic reality in our society today, so naturally there is no way to produce tragic works, and there is no need to bother discussing it? I don't think so either. In our society, due to the gradual improvement of people's lives and socialist construction, etc., tragic facts have indeed decreased a lot, but it cannot be said that they have completely disappeared. In our newspapers, we can still see reports of tragic events.
    Is it that although there are still tragedies in our lives, the people no longer like to watch sad plays, so we don't need to supply them? That's not true either. Every day, many of us go to the theater to shed tears for Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai. Is it that people only love to weep for the ancients, but not for the moderns? I don't know this, because we have not yet performed new tragedies. "Thunderstorm" is very popular, but it is already more than twenty years old.
    Indeed, we have written works such as "Liu Hulan" and "Dong Cunrui"; however, according to the traditional definition of tragedy, these works probably cannot be regarded as tragedies. These works are eulogies to heroic figures who sacrifice themselves for righteousness and regard death as going home. These characters are upright and die gloriously, and although they sacrifice their lives, they leave a good name for thousands of years, which is not a tragedy. If these works should also be regarded as tragedies, then the scope of tragedy should be expanded. We haven't discussed it either.
    The above-mentioned "tradition" is the Western tradition. We don't have to follow the West in everything, we can create our own style. However, what should this style look like? We still don't know. In our folk operas, there are many plays that start out looking like tragedies, but always end with a happy ending. Should this kind of play, which is sad at first and then happy, be regarded as our tragic formula? This has not been discussed either.
    Why are we so indifferent to tragedy?
    I don't want to promote tragedy, it doesn't need me to promote it. For more than two thousand years, it has always been an important form in literature. It depicts the contradictions and conflicts of people at the juncture of life and death, and it cares about people's fate. It is solemn and serious, and requires itself to have the power to move people's hearts. Therefore, although it does not need me to promote it, I feel a little uneasy because I don't see it. Yes, such a powerful literary form being relegated to the cold palace is indeed puzzling, especially today when the call is for a hundred flowers to bloom.
    We have opposed the theory of no conflict. However, we still dare not write works that can accommodate the greatest conflicts, tragedies. Is it that our opposition to the theory of no conflict is not thorough enough, so in creation we have adopted an attitude of moderation and reporting good news but not bad? If this is the truth, then who made us adopt that attitude? I can't figure it out.
    Can we write such a thing—a cadre who is not bad at heart but does good things badly, to the point of arousing public anger and causing trouble—as a tragedy? Or, can we write a tragedy about cadres not caring about their children, to the point that their children commit crimes?
    I don't favor tragedy, nor do I ask anyone to write tragedy for the sake of writing tragedy, so that we can have a little bit of everything, and things that existed in ancient times don't necessarily have to exist today. But I do know that tragedy does have great educational power. If I were to write a tragedy about cadres not caring about their children, my motive would be to love our second generation, to educate cadres on how to fulfill their responsibilities as parents. I use the tragic form to strengthen persuasiveness and achieve greater educational effect. I am not attacking cadres, nor am I dissatisfied with the socialist system; on the contrary, I want to enthusiastically defend our second generation, the successors to socialist construction. Given our indifference to tragedy in the past few years, I doubt whether my wish can be realized.
    Perhaps some people will say: the more democratic life there is, the fewer tragedies there will be, and tragedy itself will soon die out, so why bother discussing it! Yes, maybe that's the case. However, isn't it even more distressing and worthy of writing about, so that everyone can be educated, that tragedies still occur today in our lovely society?
    These days, Chairman Mao has taught us how to handle contradictions among the people. This is a great principle for governing the country and securing peace. Our writers should all abide by the Chairman's instructions and fulfill our responsibility of propaganda and education in our works. However, will someone say: the form of tragedy cannot be used to describe contradictions among the people, because although tragedy does not necessarily write characters to death, it still has a bit of a "drive to extinction" flavor. Is this statement correct? I can't figure out these questions for a while, so I sincerely ask for your guidance!

    论悲剧
    老舍
    这二、三年来，我们的讽刺剧的运气比悲剧的好一些。苏联曾供给了我们一些讽刺剧的理论和作品实例，我们自己也写了一些讽刺剧。从观众的反应来看，大家是喜爱讽刺剧的。可是也有人不大喜爱它：有的呢是因为讽刺的对象和自己有些相似，心中难免不大舒服；有的呢虽不把毛病往自己身上拉，可是讽刺的对象是他的同行，为了同行的义气，他不能不声明：在我们这一行里，没有那样的人，也没有那样的事；还有的呢以为讽刺就是暴露，积极性不够，所以讽刺剧，甚至于连相声，都该取缔，不准再浪费笔墨。
    不管怎样吧，我们到底有了讽刺剧和对它的争论。它的运气总算不错，即不在话下。
    至于悲剧呢，可真有点可悲。没人去写，也没人讨论过应当怎么写，和可以不可以写。
    是不是悲剧还可以照老套子去写，不用讨论了呢？我看不是。世界上最古的悲剧总是表现命运怎么捉弄人，摆布人；天意如此，无可逃脱。我们今天已不相信这套宿命论，自然也不会照着这个老调儿去创作悲剧。后代的悲剧主要地是表现人物（并不是坏人）与环境或时代的不能合拍，或人与人在性格上或志愿上的彼此不能相容，从而必不可免地闹成悲剧。今天我们是可以还用这个办法写悲剧呢，还是不可以呢？我们还没有讨论过。这只是未曾讨论，不是无可讨论。
    是不是我们今天的社会里已经没有了悲剧现实，自然也就无从产生悲剧作品，不必多此一举去讨论呢？我看也不是。在我们的社会里，因为人民生活的逐渐改善和社会主义的建设等等，悲剧事实的确减少了许多，可是不能说已经完全不见了。在我们的报纸上，我们还看得到悲剧事例的报道。
    是不是我们在生活中虽然还有悲剧，可是人民已经不喜欢看苦戏，所以我们就无须供应呢？也不是。我们天天有不少人到戏园去，为梁山伯与祝英台掉些眼泪。是不是人民只爱为古人落泪，而不喜为今人落泪呢？这我就不知道了，因为我们还没有演出过新悲剧。“雷雨”很叫座儿，但它已二十多岁了。
    不错，我们的确写出了“刘胡兰”“董存瑞”等作品；可是，用传统的悲剧定义来看，这些作品大概不能算作悲剧。这些作品是歌颂杀身成仁，视死如归的英雄人物。这些人物光明磊落，死得光荣，虽然牺牲了性命，而留芳千古，不是悲剧。假若这些作品也该算作悲剧，悲剧的范围即当扩大。我们也没讨论过。
    上述的“传统”是西洋的传统。我们不必事事遵循西洋，可以独创一格。可是，这一格应当是什么样子呢？我们还不知道。在我们的民间戏曲里，有不少出戏是一开头很像悲剧，可是到末尾总来一个大团圆。是不是这种先悲后喜的戏应当算作我们的悲剧程式呢？这也没有讨论过。
    为什么我们对悲剧这么冷淡呢？
    我并不想提倡悲剧，它用不着我来提倡。二千多年来它一向是文学中的一个重要形式。它描写人在生死关头的矛盾与冲突，它关心人的命运。它郑重严肃，要求自己具有惊心动魄的感动力量。因此，它虽用不着我来提倡，我却因看不见它而有些不安。是的，这么强有力的一种文学形式而被打入冷宫，的确令人难解，特别是在号召百花齐放的今天。
    我们反对过无冲突论。可是，我们仍然不敢去写足以容纳最大的冲突的作品，悲剧。是不是我们反对无冲突论不够彻底，因而在创作上采取了适可而止与报喜不报忧的态度呢？假若这是真情，那么，谁叫我们采取了那个态度呢？我弄不清楚。
    我们可以不可以把这样的事——一个心地并不坏的干部而把好事作坏，以至激起民愤，闹出乱子，写成悲剧呢？或者，我们可以不可以把干部不关心子女，以至子女犯了罪，写成悲剧呢？
    我并不偏爱悲剧，也不要求谁为写悲剧而去写悲剧，以使聊备一格，古代有过的东西，不必今天也有。我可是知道悲剧的确有很大的教育力量。假若我现在要写一部关于干部不关心子女的悲剧，我的动机是热爱我们的第二代，是要教育干部怎样尽到作父母的责任。我取用悲剧形式是为加强说服力，得到更大的教育效果。我既不是攻击干部，也不是不满意社会主义制度；反之，我是要热诚地保卫我们的第二代，社会主义建设的接班人。鉴于过去几年来我们对于悲剧的冷淡，我怀疑我的愿望能否实现。
    也许有人说：民主生活越多，悲剧就越少，悲剧本身不久即将死亡，何须多事讨论！对，也许是这样。不过，不幸今天在我们的可爱的社会里而仍然发生了悲剧，那岂不更可痛心，更值得一写，使大家受到教育么？
    这几天，毛主席教训我们应当怎样处理人民内部矛盾。这是治国安邦的大道理。我们作家都应当遵照主席的指示，在作品中尽到宣传教育的责任。可是，是不是就有人会说：描写人民内部矛盾不可用悲剧形式，因为虽然悲剧中不一定把人物写死，可是究竟有些“赶尽杀绝”的味道。这个说法对不对呢？我一时想不清楚这些问题，所以诚心地请求大家指教！
