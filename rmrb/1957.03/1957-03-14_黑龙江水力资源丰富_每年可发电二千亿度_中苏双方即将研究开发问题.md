Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 9th: According to TASS, the Sino-Soviet Heilongjiang comprehensive survey team's one-year investigation of the Heilongjiang River Basin on the Sino-Soviet border has proven that the hydropower resources of several major rivers in the Heilongjiang River Basin can generate 200 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. Plans are now underway to build hydroelectric power stations in this area and to connect these power stations to a unified Far East power system.

According to preliminary estimates by Chinese and Soviet scientists, after two or three Five-Year Plans, the generating capacity of these hydroelectric power stations will reach 8 to 10 million kilowatts. The main bases of this power system are the hydroelectric power stations on the Heilongjiang River and its largest tributaries – the Zeya and Bureya Rivers in Soviet territory, and the Songhua River in Chinese territory.

A huge industrial zone is planned to be established on the power base of the Heilongjiang River Basin.

In addition, the survey team also discovered 12 million hectares of arable virgin land in the Heilongjiang River Basin.

Currently, representatives from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and design institutions are in Moscow, working with Soviet scientists to summarize the materials obtained by the survey team in the Heilongjiang River Basin over the past year. Soviet and Chinese soil scientists, botanists, hydrologists, and geologists are drafting joint reports and scientific reports on the survey team's exploration. These reports will be submitted to the Sino-Soviet Joint Academic Committee, which specializes in studying the development of the Heilongjiang River.

The first meeting of this committee will be held in Moscow from March 18th to 22nd.

    黑龙江水力资源丰富
    每年可发电二千亿度
    中苏双方即将研究开发问题
    新华社10日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科3月9日讯：中苏黑龙江综合考察队一年来在中苏边境上的黑龙江流域调查的结果证明，黑龙江流域的几条大河的水力资源一年可以发电两千亿度。现在正计划在这一地区内建设水电站，并且要把这些水电站联结到一个远东统一的动力系统中去。
    据中苏两国科学家的初步估计，经过两、三个五年计划以后，这些水电站的发电能力将达到八百万到一千万瓩。这个动力系统的主要据点是黑龙江上的各个水电站以及它的最大支流——苏联境内的泽耶河和布列耶河上的水电站，中国境内的松花江上的水电站。
    在黑龙江流域的动力基地上打算建立一个巨大的工业区。
    此外，考察队还在黑龙江流域调查出了一千二百万公顷宜于耕作的生荒地。
    现在，中国科学院和设计机构的代表正在莫斯科同苏联科学家们一道总结考察队一年来在黑龙江流域工作所得的材料。苏联和中国的土壤学家、植物学家、水力学家和地质学家正在草拟关于考察队勘探情况的联合报告和科学报告书。这些报告将提交专门研究黑龙江开发问题的中苏联合学术委员会。
    这个委员会的第一次会议将在3月18日到22日在莫斯科举行。
