Strive to Raise the Living Standards of All Farmers to the Level of Prosperous Middle Peasants in About Three Years
Tan Qilong Explains the Great Superiority of Cooperation Based on the Situation in Rural Shandong

I completely agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's report. I would like to provide some information and opinions on rural issues.

Co-operatives have not been run badly, but have been run well

The rural areas of Shandong Province, like the rest of the country, have experienced a great socialist transformation movement. 96% of the province's farmers have joined agricultural co-operatives, of which 85% have joined advanced co-operatives. These co-operatives, after production and consolidation work last autumn and winter, have been consolidated. This fundamentally changed the individual economy, which was the source of capitalism in rural areas, established a socialist collective economy, thoroughly liberated rural productive forces, and opened up broad prospects and provided a reliable foundation for further development of agricultural production and national industrialization. Last year was the first year after agricultural co-operatization. Although everyone almost universally lacked experience in leading collective production and suffered major natural disasters, the province still achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, overfulfilling the five-year agricultural plan targets one year ahead of schedule. The total grain output reached 30 billion jin, completing the requirement of increasing production by 3 billion jin put forward by the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. In terms of basic farmland construction, the irrigated area alone increased by more than 18 million mu last year (before last year, there were only more than 8 million mu). About 80% of the co-operatives increased production. Except for disaster areas, more than 70% of the members of general co-operatives increased their income. The vast majority of poor peasants, lower-middle peasants and some well-to-do middle peasants have improved their lives compared to before. They expressed that they would wholeheartedly and resolutely continue to work hard in the co-operatives. There is no doubt that agricultural co-operatization is a great success with epoch-making significance. If the understanding of this aspect is insufficient, a major mistake will be made. However, around the autumn harvest last year, many people inside and outside the Party in Shandong reflected that "the rural situation is tense, farmers do not have enough food, firewood, and pocket money, and life is impossible." In a word, the co-operatives were run badly. In order to clarify people's ideological understanding and better promote the co-operatization movement, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China successively convened two (enlarged) meetings of the committee in October and November last year, and convened the Provincial People's Congress in December, specifically analyzing the basic situation after rural co-operatization, truthfully affirming the great achievements of the agricultural co-operatization movement, seriously examining the shortcomings in the work, protecting the enthusiasm of cadres and peasants in engaging in socialism, and criticizing the erroneous idea of ​​negative criticism and pouring cold water on peasants and cadres; and decided to draw more than 20,000 cadres from leading organs at all levels to lead the autumn and winter production and rectification of co-operatives in rural areas under the leadership of secretaries of Party committees at all levels. The actual work of more than three months after the meeting and the year-end distribution of co-operatives in 1956 refuted people's various claims that the co-operatives were run badly. Facts have also proved that Chairman Mao's analysis of agricultural co-operatization at the Supreme State Conference was completely correct.

Of course, it is not to say that there are no problems and shortcomings in the agricultural co-operatization movement. If such a great mass movement does not have any problems and shortcomings, it would be very strange. So what are the problems? After our investigation and analysis: First, a part of the upper-middle peasants in the co-operatives (about 20%-30% of this class) joined the co-operatives in the co-operatization craze with the attitude of following the crowd. They did not have a real understanding of joining the co-operatives. Originally, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, it would be better to wait for and enlighten these farmers until they truly and consciously asked to join the co-operatives before absorbing them into the co-operatives. However, in the high tide of the movement, they resolutely demanded to join the co-operatives, and it was difficult to refuse. After they joined the co-operatives, because the co-operatives were still in the initial stage, some could not increase their income compared to before joining the co-operatives, some felt that they were not as free and easy as before joining the co-operatives, and some, although their income also increased, said that the increase in production of poor peasants was mainly due to their light, saying that they joined the co-operatives "like a long snake swimming into a bamboo tube, it is difficult to advance or retreat." Second, in the first year of co-operatization, cadres generally lacked experience in running co-operatives, and some propaganda was unrealistic; the requirements were too hasty and too high; in terms of management, not enough attention was paid to sideline production and diversified operations; some co-operatives did not pay enough attention to running co-operatives diligently and thriftily, and too much basic construction was carried out in the first year; so some members felt that the control was too tight and pocket money was difficult. Third, the year-end distribution work was slow. Many members said: After working for a year, how much can we get? Everyone did not know the co-operative's and their own income, which caused some anxiety. Fourth, about 15% of the farmers still have varying degrees of difficulty in life after joining the co-operatives because of their thin family background, large population and lack of labor, or temporary disasters, etc. These difficulties existed before co-operatization, and some of them were solved after co-operatization ("five guarantees" households, "three fixed" households, etc.), but there are still some households in difficulty. The leadership did not anticipate this and lacked early arrangements. Fifth, a considerable number of cadres did not have a democratic style of work; they did some amateurish things, such as digging wells and technological reforms in some places not proceeding from reality, etc. This is what the peasants have the most opinions about. Sixth, individual cadres have indeed committed illegal and undisciplined acts, which have caused tensions between co-operative cadres and members in some places.

Take four concrete measures to solve the problems in cooperation

Based on the above investigation and analysis, since October last year, party and government leaders at all levels in Shandong have taken the following major measures to solve these problems in accordance with the deployment of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee: (1) Strengthen ideological education and improve the socialist consciousness of cadres and the masses. All localities have convened conferences of county, district, township, and co-operative cadres and activists to convey the spirit of the resolutions of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, summarize the local experience in production and co-operative management in the past year, affirm achievements, point out shortcomings, and support the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses in resolutely running co-operatives well; improve the leadership level of cadres by rectifying the work style of cadres and summarizing and introducing typical experiences in democratic co-operative management and diligent and thrifty co-operative management; and separately deal with individual law-breaking and undisciplined elements. (2) Since November last year, party and government leaders at all levels have concentrated their efforts on grasping the year-end settlement and distribution of co-operatives. In the distribution, the basic principles of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on co-operatives, that the withholding including agricultural tax can only account for 30%-40% of the total income, and the actual income of members should account for 60%-70% of the total income, and the principle of distribution according to work were generally implemented. Now the annual settlement and distribution work of co-operatives in the province has been generally completed, and only some remaining problems are being dealt with. (3) For the difficult households, which account for about 15% of the farmers, all localities have taken many care measures in the year-end distribution last year. In addition to strengthening comprehensive production and disaster relief work in disaster areas, many care methods have been taken in general areas. The fundamental method is to distribute the difficult households to each production team, and each production team will take care of them in the arrangement of the whole year's labor, contract them some easy work, and fix the number of labor days they should do throughout the year according to their labor capacity, and give them higher work points to encourage them to actively work. This method is being promoted universally this year. Individual co-operatives with a better foundation are starting to try further methods, that is, after formulating the annual production plan, they then conduct cost accounting, labor quotas and contracting production, and formulate the annual labor plan and pre-distribution plan. The number of work days each household will do throughout the year and the amount of grain and money they will distribute are generally determined when determining quotas and contracting production. For households with low income and possible difficulties in life, arrangements are made from the labor point of view as soon as possible. We believe that under normal years, relying on the superior system of co-operatives, with the continuous development of production, the problems of the last part of the difficult households in rural areas will be gradually and thoroughly solved. (4) As soon as the annual settlement and distribution of co-operatives is solved, party and government leaders will immediately concentrate their efforts on grasping production, grasping the plan for increasing production and income this year, grasping contracting production, further establishing production order, and specifically organizing production actions.

Through the above measures, the co-operatives in the province have been initially consolidated. In short, judging from the situation in rural Shandong, the overall situation is very good, but there are indeed many problems and shortcomings, and some are quite serious. In order to better solve these problems, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the Fourth (Enlarged) Meeting of the Committee with the participation of county party secretaries from all over the province in the latter half of last month. According to the instructions of the meeting of provincial and municipal party secretaries convened by the Party Central Committee in February, a series of corresponding measures were taken to further consolidate agricultural co-operatives and strive for a comprehensive agricultural harvest this year; and it was proposed to strive to increase the average per capita annual grain ownership in rural areas to 700 jin and the total income from agriculture and sideline occupations to 70 yuan in about three years (starting from this year), so as to raise the income and living standards of all farmers to the level equivalent to that of well-to-do middle peasants. At present, everyone is working hard with full confidence to achieve these requirements.

Farmers' lives are not worse, but much better

Here I will reflect the general income and living conditions of farmers in Shandong in recent years, especially after co-operatization. I will give a few examples: During the Spring Festival this year, seven cadres from the General Office of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China returned home for the Spring Festival. They stayed at home for more than a month and investigated the income and living conditions of 19 co-operative members of their families and relatives and neighbors. Among these 19 households, there were 10 old middle peasants, 4 new middle peasants, and 5 poor peasants. In 1936 before the Anti-Japanese War, the average income per capita was 57.64 yuan, and the average consumption was 54.33 yuan. In 1949, the average income was 69.49 yuan, and the average consumption was 65.49 yuan (the amounts in 1936 and 1949 were converted into 1956 physical prices). Last year, the average income per person was 73.36 yuan, an increase of more than 27% compared to 1936. The average consumption per person was 68.16 yuan, an increase of more than 25% compared to 1936. Among the 19 farmer households, 15 households had significantly increased income and consumption in 1956 compared with before the war; 1 household had increased income and slightly decreased consumption; only 3 households had decreased income and consumption because the population grew too fast, or because they hired people to work before the war, and lost their labor force after joining the co-operative. Here I will briefly talk about the situation that Comrade Jing Ruqin, secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Office, learned about when he returned home. His family is in Zhaozui Village, Xiangshan District, Laiwu County (mountain area), and is of the upper-middle peasant component. Before he returned home, his family kept writing letters to him complaining and asking for money. When he arrived home, his brother, aunts and grandmothers in the front and back courtyards said in unison: "After joining the co-operative, we have suffered a disaster. We have 360 jin of food per person a year, which is not even a full jar. It will be good until after the first month of the lunar year. In the spring, we will have to tighten our necks, and we will inevitably starve." But after a few days, the family prepared wine and dishes to treat him. He asked: "The family is so difficult, why are you doing this?" His brother said: "To tell you the truth, the grain we distributed last year only started to be eaten in October of the lunar calendar. Before October, we ate old grain. The amount of food per person is not 360 jin, but 500 jin. Don't worry, it is guaranteed to be enough to eat." His family of seven originally lived very well. In 1956, they bought a total of 170 chi of cloth, an average of 24 chi per person, while in 1936, the average was only 20 chi per person, and in 1949, the average was only 13.5 chi per person. During the Spring Festival, they slaughtered a pig themselves, with more than 70 jin of meat. Except for sending 10 jin to others, they ate it all themselves. Pocket money has never been cut off. There is indeed some shortage of firewood, but there is a coal stove, and there is no difficulty. Comrade Jing Ruqin asked his family: "Why do you still complain that it is difficult when life is so good?" His family said: "Everyone who is better than us says it is difficult, why don't we say it is difficult!" They also said: "Everyone is complaining because they want the higher authorities to keep more grain for us and take more care of us; some are afraid of showing off their wealth and afraid of investing in the co-operative." Similar households account for about 20% of the 104 households in the village. In fact, this situation is not unique to Laiwu County, and it is quite representative of other places. Secondly, at the end of 1956, we investigated the income distribution of 63 counties (cities), 790 agricultural co-operatives, and 30,000 co-operative member households. According to the basic situation of the investigation materials of 24 counties, 372 co-operatives, and 10,360 households that have been reviewed: the total income was 21,447,641 yuan, of which the national tax accounted for 8.07% of the total income, the production cost accounted for 27.71%, the management cost accounted for 0.42%, the reserve fund accounted for 3.44%, the public welfare fund accounted for 1.14%, the labor remuneration accounted for 54.88%, the production material remuneration accounted for 3.73%, and other expenses accounted for 0.61% (Note: In the distribution of these 372 co-operatives, the co-operative's withholding was still too tight). The average per capita grain ownership for the whole year was 607 jin, an increase of 8.6% compared with the average per capita grain ownership in 1955 (559 jin); the average per capita actual distribution of grain was 423 jin. Among these 10,360 co-operative members, 69.7% had increased income compared with last year, 10.5% had no increase or decrease, and 19.9% had decreased income. The decrease in income was mainly among rich peasants and the original upper-middle peasants. Thirdly, in December last year, I personally learned about the situation in Fei County (mountain area), which was historically very poor. The average per capita grain ownership in the county: 416 jin in 1953, 467 jin in 1954, 471 jin in 1955, and 571 jin in 1956. In the past, many farmers in this county used bran and vegetables as food, but now they can all eat grain, although it still contains a lot of coarse grain. I also visited 7 co-operatives (plain, hilly, and mountainous areas) and 23 farmer households (original poor peasants and middle peasants) with a total of 130 people in Linyi Prefecture (the living standard of farmers in this prefecture is lower in the whole province). The total income converted into cash averaged 58 yuan per person per year. Shiquanhu Village in Junan County, a mountainous area, used to be a very poor village. In 1956, the average per capita annual net income of the whole co-operative was 86.66 yuan.

In addition, we have also conducted some investigations and studies on the tension of material supply: According to statistics, the average purchasing power of each farmer in the province was 11.94 yuan in 1949, 22.68 yuan in 1953, and 33.7 yuan in 1954. The supply of several major daily necessities in the province: Pork - 3,506 tons in 1952 and 4,672 tons in 1956, an increase of 33.27%. Edible oil - 31,613 tons in 1952 and 98,197 tons in 1956, an increase of 210.62%. Cotton cloth - 5.75 million pieces in 1952 and 14.38 million pieces in 1956, an increase of 150%. Coal - 1.76 million tons in 1952 and 5.2 million tons in 1956, an increase of 194.16%. Obviously, the reason for the tension in supply is not that the quantity of material supply has decreased, but mainly "the contradiction between the people's need for rapid economic and cultural development and the current economic and cultural situation that cannot meet the people's needs" as pointed out in the resolution of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, that is, the speed of the growth of consumption needs of the broad masses of people exceeds the speed of the growth of the production of consumer goods. In the past, many farmers spun native yarn and wove native cloth, but now they have changed to wearing fine cloth and good cloth. Women in the Wuxing Agricultural Co-operative in Linyi County reflected: It takes three days to make a top. If you participate in labor in the co-operative, you can earn at least a few yuan in three days, which is almost enough to buy a top. Therefore, they are unwilling to weave cloth and make clothes themselves, and the supply of clothes on the market is in short supply. This co-operative has 519 households. In the past, almost all laundry was done with ash water, but now most of it is done with soap. Many members have bought sanitary shirts and trousers, and some women also require the supply of small-footed woolen socks. In the past, farmers made hats for elderly women and children themselves, but now many of them are bought. Many young people wear "cadre hats". Many members buy better quality flower porcelain basins, thermos bottles, etc. The sales department of the supply and marketing co-operative in this township sold 2,253 pairs of socks in 1956, an increase of 120.4% compared with 1955 (1,022 pairs); and sold 1,477 dozens of towels, an increase of 102.8% compared with 1955 (728 dozens). In Shiquanhu, Junan County, a mountain village with only 42 households and 202 people, more than 80 new cotton quilts, 120 pairs of rubber shoes and sneakers, 31 bamboo shell thermos bottles, and 15 flashlights were added in 1955-1956.

Of course, the tension in the supply of certain materials is related to the shortcomings in our work, and some artificial tension that should not have occurred has also occurred in individual areas, but this is only secondary. The supply work needs to be greatly improved in the future, but the tension in the supply of certain materials is still difficult to completely avoid. Therefore, we believe that the key lies in educating the broad masses of cadres and the people to correctly understand this situation, so as to strive to increase production, carry forward our fine tradition of diligence and thrift, and practice economy. Only on the basis of continuous development of production can the consumption needs of the broad masses of people be gradually improved.

The above are a few situations I have provided and my views on these situations. Are they appropriate? Please criticize and correct me. (Attached picture)

    争取三年左右把全体农民的生活提高到富裕中农的水平
    谭启龙就山东农村情况说明合作化的巨大优越性
    我完全同意周恩来总理的报告。我想就有关农村问题提供一些情况和意见。
    合作社不是办坏了，而是办好了
    山东省农村同全国一样，经历了伟大的社会主义改造运动。全省96％的农户已经加入了农业合作社，其中85％的农户加入了高级社。这些合作社，经过去年秋冬的生产、整社工作，已经巩固下来。这样就从根本上改变了农村产生资本主义根源的个体经济，建立了社会主义的集体经济制度，彻底解放了农村生产力，为进一步发展农业生产和国家工业化开辟了宽广的前途，提供了可靠的基础。去年是农业合作化后的第一年，大家几乎都是在没有领导集体生产的经验、又是在遭受较大的各种自然灾害的情况下，全省还获得了历史上从未有过的丰收，提前一年超额完成了五年农业计划指标，粮食总产量达到三百亿斤，完成了中共山东省委所提出的增产三十亿斤的要求。农田基本建设，去年一年仅水浇地就增加了一千八百多万亩（去年以前只有八百多万亩）。80％左右的合作社增加了生产。除灾区外，一般合作社70％以上的社员增加了收入。绝大部分贫农、下中农和一部分富裕中农的生活都较前有所改善，他们表示要在合作社里一心无二的坚决干下去。无可怀疑，农业合作化是一个伟大的成功，它具有划时代的意义。如果对于这一方面认识不足，是要犯大错误的。可是去年秋收前后，山东党内外有不少人反映“农村情况紧张，农民口粮不够吃，柴草不够烧，没有零钱使，日子没法过。”一句话，合作社办坏了。为了澄清人们的思想认识，把合作化运动更好地推向前进，中共山东省委曾于去年10月、11月先后召开了两次委员（扩大）会议，12月召开了省人民代表大会，具体分析了农村合作化后的基本情况，实事求是地肯定了农业合作化运动的巨大成绩，严肃地检查了工作中的缺点，保护了干部和农民搞社会主义的积极性，批判了那种消极指责、向农民和干部泼冷水的错误思想；并且决定从各级领导机关抽调了二万多名干部，在中共各级党委书记率领下，深入农村领导秋冬生产和整顿合作社的工作。会后三个多月实际工作和合作社1956年年终分配，事实否定了人们形形色色的、总之是合作社办坏了的说法。事实也证明这次毛主席在最高国务会议上有关农业合作化的分析是完全正确的。
    当然，不是说农业合作化运动中没有问题和缺点。像这样一个伟大的群众运动，如果没有任何问题和缺点，那倒是很奇怪的。那么究竟有些什么问题呢？经过我们的调查分析：第一、合作社中有一部分上中农（约占上中农这个阶层的20％—30％），原是在合作化热潮中抱着随大流的态度入社的，他们入社不是有真正的觉悟。本来按照党中央和毛主席的指示，对于这一部分农民，是以等待和启发他们真正自觉要求入社时再吸收他们入社为好的。可是在运动高潮中，他们坚决要求入社，又不好拒绝。他们入社后，由于合作社尚在初创时期，有的还不能较入社前增加收入，有的感到不如入社前自由自在，有的虽也增加了收入，但又说贫农增产主要是沾了他们的光，说他们自己入社“好像长蛇游进竹筒，进退两难”。第二、合作化头一年，干部都缺乏办社经验，有些宣传说得不切实际；要求过急过高；经营管理上对副业生产和多种经营注意不够；有些社对勤俭办社注意不够，头一年基本建设搞得过多；使一部分社员感到控制过紧，零用钱困难。第三、年终分配工作迟缓，许多社员说：干了一年，究竟能分多少东西？大家摸不着合作社和自己收入的家底，引起一些不安情绪。第四、还有约占总农户15％的农户，因原来家底很薄，或因人口多、劳力少，或因遭受临时灾害等等，入社后生活也还有不同程度的困难。这些困难户合作化以前原就存在，合作化以后解决了一部分（“五保”户、“三定”户等），但是还有一部分困难户。对此，领导上预计不足，缺乏及早安排。第五、有相当一部分干部作风不够民主；办了一些外行事，如有些地方打井和技术改革不从实际出发等。这是农民最有意见的。第六、个别干部确有违法乱纪现象，引起有些地方社干和社员关系紧张。
    采取四项具体措施解决合作化中的问题
    根据上述调查分析，山东各级党政领导从去年10月以后，就按照中共山东省委和省人民委员会的部署，采取了如下几个主要措施来解决这些问题：（一）加强思想教育，提高干部和群众的社会主义觉悟。各地都召开了县、区、乡、社干部和积极分子大会，通过传达中共“八大”决议精神，总结当地一年生产、办社经验，肯定成绩，指出缺点，支持干部和群众坚决办好合作社的积极性；结合整顿干部作风和总结介绍民主办社及勤俭办社的典型经验，提高干部领导水平；并有分别地处理了个别违法乱纪分子。（二）从去年11月以后，各级党政领导集中力量抓合作社年终决分，在分配中一般都执行了党中央和国务院关于合作社的扣留连农业税在内只能占总收入的30％—40％，社员实际所得应占总收入的60％—70％的基本原则和按劳取酬原则。现在全省合作社的全年决分工作大体上已经搞完，只剩一些遗留问题，正在继续处理中。（三）对占农户15％左右的困难户，各地在去年年终分配时，除灾区加强全面生产救灾工作外，在一般地区采取了不少照顾办法，其中根本的办法是：把困难户分配到各生产队里去，由各生产队从安排全年劳动中加以照顾，包给他们一些可干的轻活，并根据劳动能力固定他们全年应做劳动日，给以较高的工分，鼓励他们积极劳动。这个办法今年都在普遍推行。个别基础较好的社在开始试行进一步的办法，即在订出全年的生产计划后，接着搞成本核算、劳动定额和包工包产，订出全年的用工方案和预分方案，各户全年干多少工，分多少粮款，在确定定额和包工包产时就大体定下来。对收入少、生活可能发生困难的户，就及早从劳动上加以安排。我们相信，在一般年景下，依靠合作社这一优越制度，随着生产的不断发展，农村最后一部分困难户的问题，将会逐步地得到彻底解决。（四）在合作社全年决分一解决，党政领导紧接着全力抓生产，抓今年增产和增加收入的计划，抓包工包产，进一步建立生产秩序，具体组织生产行动。
    经过上述措施，现在全省合作社已经初步巩固下来。总之，从山东农村情况来看，总的说来是很好的，但问题和缺点确实不少，有的还相当严重。为了更好地解决这些问题，中共山东省委在上月下旬召开了有全省县委书记参加的第四次委员（扩大）会议，根据党中央在2月间召开的省市委书记会议的指示，采取了一系列相应的措施，来求得进一步巩固农业合作社和争取今年农业的全面丰收；并提出争取在三年左右（从今年起）农村平均每人全年粮食占有量达到七百斤，农副业总收入达到七十元，把全体农民的收入和生活提高相当于富裕中农的水平。目前大家都在满怀信心地为实现这些要求紧张的工作着。
    农民的生活不是不好了，而是好多了
    这里我反映一下山东农民近年来尤其是合作化后一般的收入和生活状况。我举这样几个实例：今年春节期间，中共山东省委办公厅有七个干部回家过春节，他们在家住了一个多月，调查了自己家庭和亲邻共计十九户社员的收入和生活情况。这十九户中有十户老中农、四户新中农和五户贫农。他们在抗日战争前的1936年，每口人的平均收入是五七点六四元，平均消费额是五四点三三元。1949年的平均收入是六九点四九元，平均消费额是六五点四九元（1936年和1949年的金额都是按1956年实物价格折算的）。而在去年，每人平均收入是七三点三六元，比1936年增长27％强。每人平均消费额是六八点一六元，比1936年增长25％强。在十九户农民中，1956年收入和消费额都比战前显著增加的有十五户；收入增加、消费额略为减少的有一户；只有三户因为人口增长太快，或是战前因雇人劳动，入社后又丧失了劳动力，而收入、消费都有减少。这里我简略谈一下省委办公厅秘书景如琴同志回家了解的情况。他家在莱芜县香山区赵嘴村（山区），是上中农成份。他回家前，家里不断写信向他诉苦要钱。他到家时，他的哥哥、前后院的婶子和大娘，一见面就众口齐声地说：“入了社，遭了殃，每人三百六十斤口粮，一甕子还不满，好就吃过正月，春天非扎着脖子不行，跑不了挨饿”等等。但是过了几天，家里准备了酒菜请他吃饭。他问：“家里这样困难，还弄这个干什么？”他哥哥才说：“实话告诉你吧，咱去年分的粮食旧历10月才开始吃，10月以前吃的是陈粮，每人口粮不是三百六十斤，是五百斤。你放心吧，保险够吃的。”他全家七口人，生活原来过得很好，1956年共买布一百七十尺，每人平均二十四尺，而1936年每人平均只二十尺，1949年每人平均只十三尺半。过春节时自己宰了一口猪，七十多斤肉，除送人十斤外，全部自己吃了。零用钱从来没有断过。烧柴确有些不足，但有个煤炉子，也没有困难。景如琴同志问他家里： “生活这样好，为什么还诉苦说困难呢？”他家人说：“别人比咱好的都说难办，咱为啥不说困难呢！”又说：“大家叫苦，都是想叫上级再多给留点粮食，多照顾一点；有的是怕露富，怕向社里投资。”类似这样的户，在该村一百零四户中约占20％。其实，这种情况也不是莱芜县一地所独有的，它对于其他各地都有相当大的代表性。其次1956年底，我们调查了六十三个县（市）、七百九十个农业合作社、三万户入社农户的收益分配情况，据已审查的二十四个县、三百七十二个社、一万零三百六十户调查材料的基本情况：总收入二千一百四十四万七千六百四十一元，其中交纳国税占总收入的8.07％，生产费用占27.71％，管理费用占0.42％，提存公积金3.44％，提存公益金1.14％，劳动报酬54.88％，生产资料报酬3.73％，其他支出0.61％（按：这三百七十二个社的分配中，合作社的扣留还是过紧了一点）。粮食每人平均占有量全年六百零七斤，比1955年每人平均占有量（五百五十九斤）增加8.6％；每人平均实分粮食四百二十三斤。这一万零三百六十户社员中，比去年增加收入的占69.7％，不增不减的占10.5％，减少收入的占19.9％。减少收入的主要是富农和原来的上中农。再次去年12月我亲自在历史上非常贫苦的费县（山区）了解，全县平均每人粮食占有量：1953年为四百一十六斤，1954年为四百六十七斤，1955年为四百七十一斤，1956年已达到五百七十一斤。这个县过去很多农民用糠菜当饭，现在可以全部吃粮食了，虽然还包含不少粗粮。我在临沂专区（这个专区农民生活水平在全省是较低的）还访问了七个社（平原、丘陵、山区的都有）二十三户农户（原来的贫农、中农都有）共一百三十人，总收入折合现金全年平均每人五十八元。莒南县山区石泉湖村，过去是一个很穷的村，1956年全社平均每人全年纯收入八六点六六元。
    此外，对于物资供应的紧张问题，我们也作了一些调查研究：全省平均每个农民的购买力，据统计1949年为一一点九四元，1953年为二二点六八元，1954年为三三点七元。全省几项主要生活用品的供应情况：猪肉——1952年为三千五百零六吨，1956年为四千六百七十二吨，增加了33.27％。食油——1952年为三万一千六百一十三吨，1956年为九万八千一百九十七吨，增加了210.62％。棉布——1952年为五百七十五万匹，1956年为一千四百三十八万匹，增加了150％。煤炭——1952年为一百七十六万吨，1956年为五百二十万吨，增加了194.16％。很显然，供应紧张的原因不是物资供应的数量减少了，而主要是中共“八大”决议所指出的“是人民对于经济文化迅速发展的需要同当前经济文化不能满足人民需要的状况之间的矛盾”，也就是广大人民消费需要增长的速度，超过了消费资料生产增长的速度。很多农民过去纺土纱、织土布，现在改穿细布、好布了。临邑县五星农业社的妇女这样反映：做件上衣得三天，如果参加社里劳动，三天至少几元钱，几乎可买一件上衣。因此，她们不愿自己织布做衣服了，市场上的衣服也就供不应求。这个社五百一十九户，过去洗衣服几乎全是用灰水，现在大部分用肥皂。很多社员买了卫生衫裤，有些妇女还要求供应小脚的毛袜子。老年妇女和小孩戴的帽子，过去农户都是自己做，现在很多都是购买的。青年人很多戴“干部帽”。很多社员购买质量较好的花瓷盆、热水瓶等等。这个乡的供销社门市部，1956年销售袜子二千二百五十三双，比1955年（销售一千零二十二双）增加了120.4％；毛巾销售了一千四百七十七打，比1955年（销售七百二十八打）增加了102.8％。莒南县石泉湖这个仅有四十二户、二百零二口人的山村，1955——1956两年，就新添棉被八十多床，胶鞋、球鞋一百二十双，竹壳热水瓶三十一个，手电筒十五个。
    当然，某些物资供应紧张与我们工作上的缺点有关系，个别地区也曾发生过某些不应有的人为的紧张，但是，这仅仅是次要的。今后供应工作需要很好的改进，但是某些物资的紧张情况仍然是难于完全避免的。因此，我们认为关键在于教育广大干部和群众正确了解这一情况，从而努力增加生产，发扬我们勤俭朴素的优良传统，厉行节约。只有在生产不断发展的基础上，广大群众生活消费的需要才能逐步地得到改善。
    以上是我提供的几点情况和我对这些情况的看法，是否有当？请大家批评指正。（附图片）
