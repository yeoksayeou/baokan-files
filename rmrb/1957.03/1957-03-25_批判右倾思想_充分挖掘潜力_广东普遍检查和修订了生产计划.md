　　Criticize Right-leaning Thought, Fully Tap Potential
　　Guangdong Universally Checks and Revises Production Plans
    (Our report) After conveying and implementing the Central Committee's instruction on "exhausting all means to strive for a bumper harvest this year," Guangdong has criticized right-leaning thought and inspected and revised the original production plans, so that the production plans can truly fit the actual situation and play a role in guiding production.

    The original plan for the total grain output in Huiyang Prefecture this year was 4.18 billion catties, but it has now been changed to 4.355 billion catties; the planned planting area for peanuts was 550,000 mu, but it has now been increased to 650,000 mu, with a total output of 995,000 dan; and the goal for hog production is to increase to 2.1 million heads this year, with an average of two pigs per household. Shantou Prefecture has proposed that the total grain output this year should reach 5.1148 billion catties. Other regions have also revised their various production targets for this year.

    The revision of production plans in various regions was based on the spirit of "exhausting all means," and was revised on the basis of serious discussions and full tapping of potential, so it is more in line with the actual situation than the original plan. For example, according to the large-scale water conservancy construction carried out last winter and this spring, the Boluo County Party Committee built nine large-scale water conservancy projects and 188 medium-sized water conservancy projects, benefiting an area of more than 200,000 mu; more than 4,500 small-scale water conservancy projects can eliminate 80% of the 260,000 mu of land that suffered from drought last year; this year, the soil will be improved to increase the yield per mu of low-yield fields, and other measures will be taken to appropriately increase the yield per unit area. Under conditions such as a total increase of 400,000 dan of rice this year, the original plan to produce 3,280,067 dan of rice was changed to 3,353,803 dan, an increase of 12.8% over last year and an increase of 2.2% over the original plan.

    While revising production plans, various regions have put forward measures to ensure the completion of the plans. The Shaoguan Prefectural Party Committee decided to send nine members of the prefectural committee, ministers, deputy ministers, and deputy commissioners to nine counties to serve as county party secretaries to effectively strengthen the leadership of agricultural production, and transfer more than 400 cadres from the prefectural and special agencies to the countryside to help with their work for a long time. It also proposed that the current outstanding tasks are: transforming low-yield fields, changing single cropping to double cropping, increasing the amount of fertilizer accumulated, and actively promoting technological reforms to ensure that the requirements of increased production and income are met.

    批判右倾思想　充分挖掘潜力
　　广东普遍检查和修订了生产计划
    本报讯　广东各地最近经过传达和贯彻中央关于“想尽一切办法，争取今年农业大丰收”的指示后，批判了右倾思想，对原定的生产计划进行了检查和修改，使生产计划能够真正切合实际，起到计划指导生产的作用。
    惠阳专区原计划今年粮食总产量四十一亿八千万斤，现在改为四十三亿五千五百万斤；花生原计划种植面积五十五万亩，现提高至六十五万亩，总产量九十九万五千担；生猪生产要求今年内发展到二百十万头，平均每户养猪二头。汕头专区提出今年粮食总产量要达到五十一亿一百四十八万斤。其它地区也都对今年的各项生产指标作了修改。
    各地修订生产计划，都是以“想尽一切办法”的精神，经过认真的讨论，充分挖掘潜力的基础进行修改的，所以比原定计划更加切合实际。如博罗县委根据去冬今春进行了大规模的水利建设，新建九宗大型水利工程和一百八十八宗中型水利，受益面积达二十多万亩；小型水利四千五百多宗，可消灭去年受旱面积二十六万亩的80％；今年将改良土壤提高低产田的亩产量，以及采取其它措施适当提高单位面积产量等，总共今年可增产稻谷四十万担等条件，将原订生产稻谷三百二十八万零六十七担的计划，改为三百三十五万三千八百零三担，比去年增产12.8％，比原计划增产2.2％。
    各地在修订生产计划的同时，都提出了保证完成计划的措施。韶关地委决定派出九个地委委员、部长、副部长、副专员到九个县担任县委书记，切实加强对农业生产的领导，抽调地、专机关四百多名干部下乡长期帮助工作外，并提出当前突出的任务是：改造低产田，单造改双造，增加积肥量，和积极推行技术改革等措施，来保证达到增产增收的要求。
