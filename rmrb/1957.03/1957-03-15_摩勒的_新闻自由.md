    Mollet's "Freedom of the Press"
    French Prime Minister Mollet, in his speech to the National Press Club in the United States on February 27, spoke about the Algerian issue. He boasted about the "contributions" to "peace" made by the French government in Algeria while denying the colonial atrocities committed by France in Algeria. He said that the news about French atrocities in North Africa published in the French newspapers were from unreliable sources, and that the newspapers being able to publish such news proves that: "The freedom of the press in France has a broader meaning than anywhere else."
    The words were indeed beautifully spoken, but unfortunately, the facts provide the most disgraceful footnote to them. Just one day before Mollet made these remarks, on February 26, the Paris newspaper "l'Humanité" was confiscated by the government for reporting the true situation of French abuse of prisoners of war in Algeria; the day after his speech, on February 28, the French police confiscated the soon-to-be-published "l'Humanité Sunday Edition."
    Such incidents are not limited to these two. In 1956 alone, the French government confiscated "l'Humanité" three times, and also arrested and persecuted the leaders and journalists of "l'Humanité." Is it not precisely because "l'Humanité" truthfully reported the atrocities of the French colonial army in Algeria that the French colonialists, who were trying their best to whitewash themselves, were greatly angered? In fact, even French officials sometimes have to admit to the atrocities of the French army in Algeria. Not long ago, French Foreign Minister Pineau half-heartedly admitted at the United Nations General Assembly that "when the army is engaged in action, certain misconduct is unavoidable."
    Mollet now explains that the sources of news about French military atrocities are unreliable, and that the French government's allowing newspapers to publish unreliable news is proof of freedom of the press. This puts him in the logic he was trying to avoid. Since the French government's press policy is to allow the publication of unreliable news, then the confiscation and persecution of "l'Humanité" is obviously not because the atrocities it publishes are from unreliable sources. Since "l'Humanité" was confiscated for publishing atrocity news that was *not* from unreliable sources, then what Mollet calls "freedom of the press" is can be imagined.

### 摩勒的“新闻自由”

    摩勒的“新闻自由”
    法国总理摩勒2月27日在美国全国新闻俱乐部发表演说时，谈到阿尔及利亚问题。他为法国政府在阿尔及利亚作出的对“和平”的 “贡献”吹嘘，而否认法国在阿尔及利亚所犯的殖民主义暴行。他说，法国报纸登载的有关法国在北非暴行的消息，来源都是不可靠的，而报纸能够刊登这样的消息，正可证明：“法国的新闻自由较其他任何地方都具有更广泛的意义。”
    话的确讲得非常漂亮，可惜事实却给它提供了最不体面的注脚。就在摩勒讲这些话的前一天，即2月26日，巴黎“人道报”因为报道了法国在阿尔及利亚虐待战俘的真实情况，遭到了政府没收；在他讲话的第二天，即2月28日，法国警察又没收了即将发行的“人道报星期日刊”。
    这类事件不止这么两件。只1956年一年，法国政府就曾三次没收“人道报”，又对“人道报”的领导人和记者横加逮捕和迫害。法国当局采取这种做法，难道不正是因为“人道报”真实地报道法国殖民军在阿尔及利亚的暴行而使得竭力为自己粉饰的法国殖民主义者大为恼怒吗？其实，关于法军在阿尔及利亚的暴行，连法国官方人士有时也不得不加以承认。不久以前，法国的外交部长比诺在联合国大会上就半吞半吐地承认过：“当军队在从事行动的时候，某些不良行为是不可避免的”。
    摩勒现在解释说，关于法军暴行的消息的来源，都是不可靠的，而法国政府容许报纸登载来源不可靠的消息，是新闻自由的证明。这使得他陷进了他本想躲避的逻辑之中。既然法国政府的新闻政策是容许不可靠的新闻发表，那么没收和迫害“人道报”显然就不是因为它刊载的暴行消息来源不可靠。既然因为“人道报”刊载了不是来源不可靠的暴行消息而被没收，那么摩勒所说的“新闻自由”是什么也就可想而知了。
