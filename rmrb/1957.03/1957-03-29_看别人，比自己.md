    Looking at Others, Compared to Oneself
    The Chongqing Railway Bureau has the following regulation: cadres at the division level and above have 20 square meters of housing, and section chiefs have 8 square meters of housing, for which no rent is charged, for use as reception rooms. Some division chiefs haven't even taken office, but their dormitories have already been prepared. The fifteen rooms at numbers 39 and 40 of the Chongqing International Village have been vacant for three months to more than four years. Last year, this bureau built high-level cadre dormitories in Chengdu, and also spent a huge sum of 8,000 yuan to purchase spring beds, small round tables, glass cabinets, writing desks and other furniture for the cadres living there. However, the housing problems of some employees of this bureau have not been well resolved.
      In contrast to the practice of the Chongqing Railway Bureau, the Party Secretary of the Chongqing Fourth Silk Factory lives in a dimly lit, damp basement, giving the new dormitories to the workers. It is hoped that the responsible personnel of the Chongqing Railway Bureau can also look at others, compare themselves, and learn from the spirit of the leaders of the Fourth Silk Factory in sharing joys and hardships with the masses, and abolish those unnecessary special treatments.

    看别人，比自己
    重庆铁路管理局有这么样一种规定：处级以上干部有二十平方公尺的房屋、科长有八平方公尺的房屋不收房租，作会客室用。有的处长没有到任，宿舍早就给准备好了。重庆国际村三十九号和四十号的十五间房子，就这样空了三个月以至四年多。这个局去年在成都新建了高级干部宿舍，去年又以八千元之巨，购置了棕床、小圆桌、玻璃柜、写字台等家具，供住在这里的干部使用。可是，这个局有些职工的住房问题却没有很好地解决。
      与重庆铁路管理局的作法相反，重庆第四制丝厂的党委书记住的是光线暗淡、地下潮湿的房子，把新宿舍让给职工住。希望重庆铁路管理局的负责人员也能看别人，比自己，学习第四制丝厂领导同志与群众同甘共苦的精神，取消那些不必要的特殊待遇。    碧桃
