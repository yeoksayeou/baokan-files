    Oppose Ambush Tactics
    Last December, the Northwest First Engineering Company's Waste Reclamation Plant sold fifteen tons of scrap steel bars to private merchants at a high price of 300 yuan per ton, refusing to hand them over to the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. The Northwest Sixth Engineering Company had thirty tons of scrap steel left over from selection. According to the agreement, it should have been handed over to the office for reception, but the company believed that steel supply was tight, and handing it over would not guarantee receiving steel in return, so they preferred long-term stockpiling to actively processing or utilizing it.
    Why did the Northwest First and Sixth Engineering Companies experience this situation? This is related to the fact that their leader—the Northwest Construction Engineering Bureau's Materials Company—does not value the recycling of scrap iron and steel. To this day, this Materials Company does not have a department to manage this work. The Metal Section says that the Planning Section is responsible, the Planning Section says that the Business Section manages it, and the Business Section says that the Management Section manages it. Who exactly is responsible? This year, the Ministry of Construction Engineering assigned them a first-quarter scrap iron and steel handover task, and they believe they can only complete a handover figure of 36 tons. However, after we went to various companies, processing plants, construction areas, and work sections to understand the situation, the actual scrap iron and steel that can be recycled is four or five times greater than the figure they proposed. May I ask, knowing that steel materials are in short supply, why are they not actively working to recycle scrap iron and steel?　Wang Zhitong

    反对打埋伏
    去年12月西北第一工程公司废料复活厂将十五吨废钢筋以每吨三百元的高价售给私商，而不肯交给冶金工业部。西北第六工程公司挑选剩下的三十吨废钢，按协议应该交给办事处接收，但该公司认为钢材供应紧张，上交了领不到钢材，宁愿长期积压也不积极处理或利用。
    为什么西北第一、第六工程公司发生这种情况呢？这与他们的领导——西北建筑工程局材料公司不重视回收废钢铁有关。至今这个材料公司还没有管理这个工作的科室，金属科说该计划科负责，计划科说该业务科管，业务科又说该管理科管，究竟该谁负责呢？今年建筑工程部，给他们布置了一季度废钢铁上交任务，他们认为只能完成三十六吨的上交数字，但经我们到各公司、加工厂、工区和工段了解，实际能回收的废钢铁，比他们提出的数字要大四、五倍。请问，明知钢铁材料紧张，为什么不积极去做回收废钢铁的工作呢？　王智通
