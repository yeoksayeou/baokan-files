A Factory with Long-Term Production Increase and Savings
By our correspondent Chen Yongjin

The Kunming Metallurgical Plant is located in the western suburbs of Kunming; this is known to many. When you go to the western suburbs to find the Kunming Metallurgical Plant, you often pass by its gate without even realizing it, because its appearance is so unremarkable. It does not have the grand gate of a typical factory or government office; it has only two low brick piers, and even these brick piers were left over from before Liberation. The offices and dormitories of the factory director and the Party committee secretary are also bungalows inherited from before Liberation. This factory, which appears rather old-fashioned on the surface, has created the miracle of increasing production year after year and saving a large amount of funds for the country every year.

The ordinary workers here all understand the principle that capitalist accumulation relies on exploitation, while socialist accumulation relies on savings. Therefore, they always consider how to increase production and how to save in matters large and small.

Whenever the leaders and workers here talk about their work achievements, they always talk about how to learn from the Soviet Union's experience, learn from the experience of fraternal factories, and summarize and learn from the experience of their own factory; how to calculate the big picture and the small details, and so on. From the mouths of their staff and workers, one can hear how much effort has been spent in order to increase production and save!

In 1953, when they had just separated from the wire factory, the recovery rate was very low and the consumption of raw materials was very high, yet they accepted the task of saving 300,000 yuan for the country. It was not an easy task for the Kunming Metallurgical Plant to complete the savings task of 300,000 yuan. The factory director spent all day talking to this person and studying with that person; the Party committee organized technical workers throughout the factory to start discussions. Engineers Wang Shuzhi and He Zhiyuan, based on their past smelting experience, proposed that the recovery rate be increased from the existing 85% to 95%. The leadership of the smelter immediately organized the workers to study and learn the engineers' suggestions. As a result of the implementation of this proposal, the smelting indicators were greatly improved.

In the savings accounting of all factory workers, many veteran workers and technicians also talked about the recovery of by-products. Some people saw in newspapers and periodicals that the Shenyang Metallurgical Plant had reached 94%. Some people said that the Kunming Metallurgical Plant did not have the good equipment of the Shenyang Metallurgical Plant, and it was impossible to reach 94%. The factory leaders immediately sent an engineer to Shenyang to study. Just as the people they sent to Shenyang to study left Kunming, someone else proposed that the factory was using too much waste coke. Shanghai used sixteen tons of coke to refine one hundred tons of products, while they used twenty-five tons to refine one hundred tons. If they could really learn from Shanghai's experience, wouldn't that be saving a lot of money? So they immediately sent an old worker to Shanghai to study. Afterwards, the old worker Feng Mingyu proposed a suggestion to improve the structure of the furnace. According to Feng Mingyu's suggestion, each furnace could save 300 kilograms of coke, and also shorten the smelting time by three hours and reduce the use of six workers. Dong Fusheng proposed that the slag should be properly utilized, and this item alone could save 300 yuan per ton.

These are all big accounts. In addition, they also calculated many small accounts. After such careful study and meticulous calculation, in 1953 they completed a savings task not of 300,000 yuan, but of 400,000 yuan.

The Party committee of the smelter is very clear that in order to better complete the state's tasks of increasing production and practicing economy, it is only necessary to give full play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses. Carrying out the advanced producer movement in depth is a good way to give play to the enthusiasm of the masses. Last year was the year in which the Kunming Metallurgical Plant completed the most national tasks and saved the most money. The tasks completed in 1956 increased more than three times compared to 1955. This was mainly because the labor competition throughout the factory was carried out well. Among the more than 900 employees in the factory, 373 became advanced producers. In last year's advanced producer movement, 111 pieces of advanced experience were promoted. These advanced experiences greatly improved production efficiency and product quality.

It was not so easy for the Kunming Metallurgical Plant to carry out the advanced producer movement. At the beginning of the advanced producer movement, this matter was simply placed on the shoulders of the trade union, and as a result, the movement was not carried out very well. It was only when the Party committee secretary and the factory director, the trade union, and almost all the leading comrades took action that the movement began to develop. In the advanced producer movement, the "pothole" rejects were eliminated. In February of last year, there were still 2,711 "pothole" rejects. In March, this number dropped to 1,123, and now they have basically been eliminated. In the newly built workshop, the workers' skills were not proficient, and they could not control the temperature of the furnace fire. Through the same-job meetings, after exchanging Duan Wenyi's experience, the workers who could not control the furnace fire were able to control it.

In the promotion of advanced experience, some people once looked down on minor experiences. They said, how could there be so many advanced people and deeds? The Party committee fully realized that fresh things appear among the broad masses of employees at every moment. The problem is whether you are good at discovering and summarizing them. The Party committee also proposed a method of starting with the summary of minor experiences. When promoting Han Fangwen's experience of nailing slices quickly and Qin Guangrong's experience of punching slices straight, some people said: Han Fangwen can nail slices quickly because he is strong, and Qin Guangrong can punch slices straight because he has long arms. Many people were unwilling to learn and promote these experiences, thinking that they were small experiences. The workshop branch repeatedly studied this, and the administration and the trade union jointly organized practical operation performances, in which these comrades introduced their own experience in detail, and it was quickly promoted.

Many comrades at the Kunming Metallurgical Plant have said that in order to do a good job in increasing production and practicing economy, it is necessary to reduce costs; to reduce costs, it is necessary to do a good job in economic accounting. Economic accounting must become the business of the broad masses of employees, so that every worker can understand the level of costs at any time, and so that they know whether they are saving or wasting in production. The Kunming Metallurgical Plant has achieved this requirement after implementing team-based economic accounting.

Cost reduction in the workshops was implemented in 1954. At that time, the masses discussed the cost plan, but the masses did not know exactly how much the cost was in the discussion; only the business section knew the cost. When the plan was checked in the first quarter of 1954, it was found that the cost had increased. At that time, the tendency to only care about production and not about costs was criticized. In June of the same year, the cost was arranged into the monthly plan, and as a result, the cost was reduced by 3.02% compared with 1953, and 1.16% lower than the plan for the year.

In 1954, after seeing the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel's team accounting, they conducted a test in the blast furnace workshop. Workers inspected their production technology, material consumption, and machine equipment capabilities. After inspection, they learned that the consumption of materials had not reached the national standards, and the quality of the products had not reached the national plan. Many workers said that in the past they only knew how to produce, and did not know whether the national plan had been completed or not. After implementing team accounting, everyone understood. Now, when smelting a furnace, they know where the savings are and where the waste is, and they also know whose work is good and whose work is bad. The electrolysis workshop used glass tubes, and used to take forty each month, breaking more than twenty. After the implementation of team accounting, the workers all knew that breaking a glass tube was equivalent to several days' wages for a worker. They reduced their usage from more than forty per month to eighteen, and now only need five each month. The workers said: "You can do it with just a little attention!" Last year, the value of savings realized by implementing team accounting was 65,000 yuan more than the planned savings.

The advantage of implementing team accounting is that it is easy to discover advanced deeds, and it is also easy to break through weak links, so that everyone uses their brains. Because everyone's production is good or bad, wasteful or economical, the team accountant can see clearly. This is also an important reason why the Kunming Metallurgical Plant has done a good job in increasing production and practicing economy.

    一个长期增产节约的工厂
    本报记者  陈勇进
    昆明冶炼厂在昆明西郊，这是许多人都知道的。当你到西郊找昆明冶炼厂的时候，往往从它的大门前走过去也不知道，因为它的表面太不惹人注意了。它没有一般工厂或者机关的大门，仅仅是两个低矮的砖垛，就是这两个砖垛也是解放前留下来的。厂长和党委书记的办公室和宿舍，也都是解放前遗留下来的平房。这个从表面上看来比较陈旧的工厂，却创造了年年增产，年年为国家节约大批资金的奇迹。
    这里的普通职工都明白：资本主义的积累靠剥削，社会主义的积累靠节约的道理。因此他们在大大小小的事情上总要考虑如何增产如何节约。
    这里的领导人员和工人，每谈到他们工作成就的时候，总会谈如何学习苏联的经验，学习兄弟厂的经验，总结和学习自己厂的经验；如何算了大账和小账等等。从他们的职员和工人的口里，可以听到，为了增产为了节约，该花费了多少心血呀！
    1953年，他们和电线厂刚刚分厂时，回收率很低，原材料消耗很大，他们却接受了为国家节约三十万元的任务。昆明冶炼厂完成节约任务三十万元，并不是件容易的事。厂长整天找这个人谈话，找那个人研究；党委会组织全厂的技术工人展开讨论。工程师王树芝、何志远根据自己过去冶炼的经验提出回收率从现有的85％提高到95％的建议。冶炼厂的领导上，马上组织工人研究和学习了工程师的建议。这项建议执行的结果，冶炼指标有了很大的提高。
    在全厂职工的节约算账中，不少老工人和技术人员也谈到副产品的回收问题，有人从报纸上、刊物上看到沈阳冶炼厂已达到94％，有人说昆明冶炼厂没有沈阳冶炼厂的设备好，要达到94％是不可能的，厂的领导上马上派了一个工程师到沈阳学习。他们派去沈阳学习的人，刚刚离开昆明，有人又提出本厂使用的焦炭浪费太大，上海是十六吨焦炭炼一百吨产品，而他们却是二十五吨炼一百吨，如果真能把上海的经验学来，不又是节约一大笔钱吗？于是他们又马上派了一个老工人到上海学习。之后，老工人冯明雨又提出改进炉子结构的建议，按着冯明雨的建议，每炉可节约三百公斤焦炭，还可缩短冶炼三小时的时间，少用六个工人。董福生提出渣子要好好利用，仅这一项每吨也可节约三百元。
    这些都是大账。此外，他们还算了很多小账。经过这样认真的学习和精打细算，1953年他们完成的节约任务不是三十万元，而是四十万元。
    冶炼厂的党委非常清楚，要更好的完成国家的增产节约任务，只有发挥广大群众的积极性。深入地开展先进生产者运动，就是发挥群众积极性的一个很好的方法。去年，是昆明冶炼厂完成国家任务最大、节约也最多的一年。1956年完成的任务比1955年增加三倍多。这主要是全厂的劳动竞赛开展得好，在全厂的九百多职工中，有三百七十三名成了先进生产者。在去年的先进生产者运动中，推广先进经验一百一十一件。这些先进经验，大大地提高了生产效率和产品质量。
    昆明冶炼厂开展先进生产者运动，也并不是那么容易的事。在开展先进生产者运动之初，把这件事情单纯地放在工会身上，结果运动并没有很好地开展起来。还是党委书记和厂长、工会以及几乎所有的领导同志都动手的时候，这个运动才开展起来了。在先进生产者运动中，使凹洞废品消灭了。去年2月份还有凹洞废品二千七百一十一块，3月份即降低到一千一百二十三块，现在已基本上消灭了。新建的车间，工人技术不熟练，控制不住炉火的温度，通过同工种会议，交流了段文义的经验后，使不能控制炉火的工人也能控制了。
    在推广先进经验中，也曾经有人看不起点滴经验。他们说，那里有这样多的先进人物和事迹。党委会充分认识到：在广大的职工中每时每刻都有新鲜事物出现，问题在于你是否善于发现和总结。党委会还提出从点滴经验总结入手的方法。在推广韩方文钉片快，秦光荣打片直的经验时，有的就说：韩方文钉片子快是因为他力气大，秦光荣打片子直是因为他手杆长。不少人不愿学习和推广这些经验，认为是些小经验。车间支部再三地研究，行政上和工会共同组织了实际操作表演，由这些同志详细地介绍了他们自己的经验，才迅速地推广开来。
    昆明冶炼厂的不少同志都谈到，要搞好增产，要搞好节约，一定要降低成本；要降低成本，一定要搞好经济核算。经济核算一定要变成广大职工群众的事，使每个工人都随时了解成本的高低，使他们知道他们在生产中是节约呢还是浪费。昆明冶炼厂在实行班组经济核算后达到了这个要求。
    成本下车间是1954年的事，那时群众曾讨论过成本计划，可是群众在讨论中不知道成本到底有多少，成本只有业务科才知道。1954年第一季度检查计划时发现成本提高了，当时批判了只管生产不管成本的倾向，同年6月把成本安排到每月的计划里，结果这一年比1953年降低成本3.02％，比当年的计划降低1.16％。
    1954年，他们看到了鞍钢的班组核算的经验后，即在鼓风炉车间进行了试验。工人检查了他们的生产技术、材料消耗、机器的设备能力。经过检查，了解到材料的消耗没达到国家指标，产品的质量没达到国家计划。许多工人说，过去只知道生产，不知道到底完成没完成国家的计划，一实行班组核算，大家心里明白了，现在炼一炉也知道节约在那里浪费是在那里，也知道谁的工作好谁的工作坏了。电解车间用玻璃管，一月领四十个，打破二十多个。实行班组核算后，工人都知道打破一根玻璃管要合一个工人好几天的工资。他们由过去每月领四十多个减少到十八个，现在每月只领五个就够了。工人说：“只要一注意就行啦！”去年实行班组核算节约的价值比计划节约的数字多了六万五千元。
    实行班组核算的好处是，很容易发现先进事迹，也很容易突破薄弱环节，使每个人都开动脑筋。因为每个人生产的好坏，浪费和节约，班组核算员都看得清清楚楚。这也是昆明冶炼厂搞好增产节约的重要原因。
