Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The CCP Central Committee and the State Council issued a decision on developing pig production on February 28, 1957. The full text is as follows:

    In the past two years or more, the decline in pig production has been serious, and the consequences of the decline in pig production have also been serious. It has made the meat supply in urban and rural areas tight, reduced the amount of pig manure fertilizer in rural areas, and reduced the number of pork exports, directly affecting the progress of national construction and the improvement of people's lives. The whole Party and the people of the whole country must attach importance to this issue and quickly take concrete steps to reverse the decline in pig production.

    From the national liberation to the first half of 1954, China's pig production grew year by year. According to the statistics in June 1954, the total number of pigs in the country reached 100.1 million, which was the highest level of pig production in China's history. Since the second half of 1954, although pig production in some provinces has continued to grow, the total number of pigs in the country has begun to decline. It continued to decline in 1955, falling to 87 million in June of the same year. In June 1956, it fell to 84 million, a decrease of 17% compared with June 1954. Since the second half of 1956, due to the fact that Party and government organizations at all levels have begun to pay attention to the decline in pig production and have begun to pay attention to the organizational leadership of pig production, especially due to the implementation of the policy of "private ownership, private raising, and public assistance" stipulated in the "Instructions of the State Council on Developing Pig Raising" on July 1, 1956, pig production in some areas has now begun to increase somewhat. However, the trend of declining pig production nationwide has not been fundamentally changed.

    The specific reasons for the decline in pig production are different in different regions and at different times, but the main reasons are the following three:

    First, because China's grain production has not increased rapidly, there is a contradiction between people's rations and pig feed that is difficult to balance well. After the implementation of the state's unified purchase and sale of grain in the second half of 1953, the amount of grain purchased by the state increased compared with the past, and the surplus grain of farmers decreased, resulting in insufficient grain for feed. In 1954, the national flood caused a reduction in grain production in disaster areas, and excessive grain purchases in bumper harvest areas further reduced the source and supply of feed. At the same time, most of the rural tofu workshops, flour mills, and oil mills stopped production due to insufficient supply of grain and oil, and excessive concentration of grain processing in cities also aggravated the difficulty of supplying bran. Historically, farmers' arrangements for grain distribution have been first for human rations, second for feed for draught animals, and third for feed for pigs. In the past two years or more, the state had to concentrate its efforts on solving the supply of rations for urban and rural residents, and the portion of grain used as feed had to be reduced. It has been difficult to fully guarantee the feed for draught animals, and the feed for pigs has become even tighter.

    Second, there are shortcomings in the purchase price and purchase work of live pigs. The state commercial departments did not promptly see that after the unified purchase and sale of grain, the cost of raising pigs for farmers has increased due to the tight supply and rising prices of feed, and they did not promptly see that after agricultural cooperation, the purpose of farmers raising pigs is no longer to fertilize their own fields, but to make profits. The issue of how the state's purchase price of live pigs can ensure that farmers benefit from raising pigs has not been fundamentally resolved. Although the purchase price of live pigs has been raised several times, it has remained low for a long time, and it is even lower in remote areas. In addition, there are also shortcomings and errors in the purchase work, such as multiple circulation links, high management costs, overly strict implementation of purchase specifications, and grading down and price reduction. These shortcomings and errors make farmers unprofitable or obtain too little profit from raising pigs, resulting in an incompatible contradiction between the state's price policy and farmers' pig-raising costs. In this case, farmers lack the enthusiasm to raise pigs, cannot actively save grain for feed, and widely collect green feed to supplement the shortage of feed, thus affecting the reduction of pig production.

    Third, the guidance for farmers raising pigs has not adapted to the new situation after agricultural cooperation. In the process of agricultural cooperation in the second half of 1955, because we did not promptly solve the issue of whether the development of pig production should be mainly private raising or public raising, farmers were hesitant about raising pigs. After the basic completion of agricultural cooperation, we did not promptly recognize that individual farmers combining farming and pig raising within their own households has basically become a situation where land is collectively cultivated by agricultural production cooperatives, while most pig raising is still carried out by individual members. Therefore, we did not guide agricultural production cooperatives to promptly solve problems such as the production and supply of feed, the use and sale of pig manure, the raising and distribution of boars, sows, and piglets, and the division of labor and cooperation based on this changing situation. We did not pay attention to timely adjusting the contradictions between the household sideline occupations of members and the collective economy of cooperatives, as well as the contradictions between individual interests and collective interests, that existed in these issues. This has placed many restrictions and difficulties on the pig raising of members and individual farmers under the new situation.

    In order to fundamentally change the downward trend of pig production and strive to complete the state's plan for developing pig production, the following decisions are made in response to the above-mentioned reasons for the decline in pig production, and it is hoped that Party and government organizations at all levels will earnestly implement them.

    1.  The growth of feed is the basis for developing pig production. While actively developing pig production, all localities and agricultural production cooperatives must unify the planned planting area of feed, be responsible for arranging the production and distribution of feed, and must use local possible conditions to maximize the potential of feed and open up feed sources to effectively ensure the feed supply for the development of pig production.

    Arrangements for refined feed: (1) All localities and agricultural production cooperatives should expand the planting area of high-yielding feed crops and increase the production of various refined feed crops that can replace bran according to the needs of pig raising and local possibilities. (2) Rural tofu workshops, flour mills, and oil mills that have been closed down should appropriately resume production, and grain and oil processing enterprises that are excessively concentrated in cities should be dispersed to rural areas in a planned manner. (3) Grain and oil processing enterprises that will continue to produce in cities in the future should supply their by-products to nearby rural areas for feeding pigs in a timely manner instead of transporting them over long distances. (4) The grain sold by the state to grain-deficient farmers should be changed to raw grain, which they will process themselves. (5) Bran and other grain and oil processing by-products should be rationally distributed by cooperatives, and their selling prices should be reduced as much as possible. (6) When the state purchases grain in a unified manner, it must leave sufficient feed for members of agricultural production cooperatives and individual farmers according to the local standard of retaining grain; in the future, the feed required for increasing pigs should be solved in the increased part of grain production.

    Arrangements for green feed: (1) Cooperatives, members and individual farmers should be mobilized to fully utilize and widely collect existing green feed in the locality. (2) The production of high-yielding green feed crops such as water hyacinth and cowpea should be greatly developed according to local natural conditions. (3) In areas where green feed is insufficient, cooperatives should reserve the necessary amount of feed land for members according to their needs for pig raising, and increase the production of green feed.

    The provinces south of the Yangtze River, the mountainous areas of the North, and other sparsely populated areas with abundant green feed should raise a large number of pigs.

    2.  It is necessary to seriously correct all the shortcomings and errors in the price policy and procurement system that hinder the development of pig production, so that the state's price policy and procurement system can fully play its due role in stimulating pig production. According to the new situation that pig production has changed and pig-raising costs have increased after agricultural cooperation, the state has decided to increase the purchase price of live pigs on a large scale nationwide. Since the purchase prices in some areas have been increased in the first half of 1956 and some have not yet been increased, all localities should raise the prices to varying degrees depending on the different situations (the specific increase range of prices in each province will be stipulated separately by relevant departments of the State Council). However, all regions should ensure that the increased purchase price can indeed guarantee that farmers have a certain profit from raising a fat pig, so as to stimulate the development of pigs. At the same time, the state has decided to narrow the purchase price difference between regions, and the cost of transporting live pigs out of areas with inconvenient transportation will be partially borne by the state after the regional price difference is narrowed. After the purchase price is increased, it has been decided to slightly increase the sales prices in rural and urban areas and reduce the slaughter tax in order to rationally arrange prices and facilitate the implementation of the price policy. In order to thoroughly overcome the bad phenomenon of grading down and price reduction in the purchase work, the state commercial departments should stipulate the tolerance of the quality standards for the acceptance of live pigs, reward accurate inspection, punish grading down and price reduction, improve the acceptance technology of purchase personnel, strengthen the political education of purchase personnel, and earnestly cultivate the fine style of consulting with the masses and listening to their criticisms. The fat pigs sold by farmers will be purchased uniformly by the food company or entrusted to the supply and marketing cooperative. In the future, for each fat pig purchased, 8 to 15 jin of meat will be left for the pig-raising farmers, and a certificate valid for one year will be issued for supply based on the certificate.

    3.  Agricultural production cooperatives must strengthen organizational leadership and make overall arrangements for the development of pig production. In order to implement the policy of "private ownership, private raising, and public assistance," cooperatives should help members make pig-raising plans, arrange pig feed, purchase pig manure, and set aside time and provide convenience so that members can raise pigs. The prices for supplying feed and purchasing pig manure should rationally take into account the individual interests of members and the collective interests of the cooperative. Cooperatives should raise boars and sows and breed piglets in proportion to the production plans for developing pigs inside and outside the cooperative. While conscientiously implementing the policy of private pig raising as the mainstay, cooperatives with the conditions to raise pigs should appropriately carry out collective pig raising.

    4.  National state-owned farms across the country should actively develop pig production and gradually establish bases for raising a large number of pigs.

    5.  The food units of large cities, organs, troops, schools, and enterprises should, under the principle of saving grain, supply the leftover soup and dishes to nearby farmers to raise pigs together with the farmers. The above-mentioned food units in the suburbs of large cities and small and medium-sized towns, if they have the conditions, can raise pigs themselves.

    6.  Strengthen the work of epidemic prevention and treatment of pig diseases to reduce pig mortality. The agricultural management departments in various localities are entrusted with formulating plans for preventing and treating pig diseases, cooperating with pig purchasing units and agricultural production cooperatives, and gradually promoting the prevention and treatment work through typical demonstrations.

    7.  Each county should organize a pig production guidance committee jointly by the agricultural department, the grain department, and the commercial department to be responsible for pig production, purchase and sales, feed supply, and epidemic prevention.

    8.  This decision should not be implemented among minority nationalities who believe in Islam. They should develop the production of cattle, sheep, horses, and donkeys there according to local conditions.

    中共中央和国务院作出决定
    领导农民大量养猪
    切实保证饲料供应；提高生猪收购价格，克服压级压价现象，每购一头  肥猪给养猪农民留肉八斤到十五斤；贯彻执行“私有、私养、公助”方针
    新华社28日讯  中共中央和国务院于1957年2月28日发布关于发展养猪生产的决定，全文如下：
    近两年多以来，生猪生产下降的情况是严重的，生猪生产下降所造成的后果也是严重的。它使城乡人民肉食供应紧张，使农村猪粪肥料减少，使猪肉出口数量减缩，直接影响了国家建设的进行和人民生活的改善。全党和全国人民必须重视这个问题，迅速采取具体步骤扭转生猪生产下降的情况。
    自全国解放至1954年上半年，我国生猪生产是逐年增长的。据1954年6月的统计，全国生猪总数达到一亿零一百万头，这是历史上我国生猪生产的最高水平。从1954年下半年起，虽然有些省份的生猪产量还在继续增长，但是全国生猪总数已经开始下降。1955年继续下降，到同年6月降到八千七百万头。1956年6月又降到八千四百万头，比1954年6月减少了17％，1956年下半年以来，由于各级党政组织已经开始注意生猪生产下降的情况，已经开始注意生猪生产的组织领导，特别是由于执行了1956年7月1日“国务院关于发展养猪的指示”中所规定的“私有、私养、公助”的方针，部分地区的生猪产量现在已经开始有些增长。但是，全国生猪生产下降的趋势还没有根本改变。
    引起生猪生产下降的具体原因，在各个地区各个时期是各不相同的，但是主要原因有下列三个：
    第一、由于我国粮食生产增长不快，人的口粮和猪的饲料之间存在着难以很好兼顾的矛盾。1953年下半年实行粮食统购统销以后，国家收购粮食的数量比以前有所增加，农民的余粮减少，饲料用粮发生了不足的情况。1954年全国大水灾，灾区粮食减产，丰收区购粮过多，更加减少了饲料的来源和供应。同时，农村的豆腐坊、粉坊、油坊因粮食油料供应不足，大部分停止生产，粮食加工过多地集中于城市；也加重了糠麸供应的困难。历来农民对粮食分配的安排，首先是人的口粮，其次是耕畜的饲料，再次才是生猪的饲料。过去二年多以来，国家要集中力量解决城乡人民口粮的供应，粮食中用作饲料的部分不得不被迫减少。耕畜的饲料已经难得充分保证，生猪的饲料就更加紧张了。
    第二、生猪的收购价格和收购工作有缺点。国家商业部门没有及时地看到粮食统购统销以后，因为饲料的供应紧张和价格上涨、农民的养猪成本已经提高，又没有及时地看到农业合作化以后，农民个人养猪的目的已经不是为了自己肥田，而是为了获利，一直没有从根本上解决国家对生猪的收购价格如何保证农民养猪有利的问题。生猪的收购价格虽经几次提高，但是仍然长期偏低，偏僻地区则更低。此外，收购工作中还存在着流转环节多、管理费用高、收购规格执行过严以及压级压价等缺点和错误。这些缺点和错误使农民养猪无利或者得利太少，在国家的价格政策和农民的养猪成本之间发生了不相适应的矛盾。在这种情况下，农民就缺乏养猪的积极性，不能积极地节约粮食，用作饲料，并广泛地采集青饲料，补充饲料的不足，因而影响了生猪的减产。
    第三、对于农民养猪的指导，没有适应农业合作化以后的新情况。1955年下半年农业合作化的过程中，由于我们没有及时地解决发展生猪生产应当以私养为主或者以公养为主的问题，使农民对养猪心存观望。农业合作化基本完成以后，我们又没有及时地认识清楚个体农民在一家一户之内结合进行种地和养猪的情况，已经基本上变成土地由农业生产合作社集体耕种、而养猪则大部分仍然由社员个人饲养的情况，因此，我们没有指导农业生产合作社根据这种变化的情况，去及时地解决饲料的生产和供应、猪粪的使用和买卖、公猪母猪仔猪的饲养和分配、劳动的分工和协作等等问题，没有注意及时地调整在这些问题上所存在的社员的家庭副业和合作社的集体经济之间的矛盾，以及个人利益和集体利益之间的矛盾。这样，就使社员和个体农民的养猪在新情况下受到了许多的限制，发生了许多的困难。
    为着根本改变生猪生产的下降趋势，努力争取完成国家关于发展生猪生产的计划，针对上述生猪生产下降的原因，特作如下决定，望各级党政组织切实贯彻执行。
    一、饲料的增长是发展生猪生产的基础。各个地方各个农业生产合作社在积极发展生猪生产的同时，必须统一计划饲料的耕种面积，负责安排饲料的生产和分配；必须利用当地的可能条件尽量地发掘饲料的潜力，开辟饲料的来源，以切实保证生猪生产发展的饲料供应。
    对精饲料的安排：（1）各个地方各个农业生产合作社应当根据养猪的需要和当地的可能，扩大高产量的饲料作物的耕种面积，增产各种能够代替糠麸的精饲料作物。 （2）农村停业的豆腐坊、粉坊、油坊应当适当地恢复生产，城市过分集中的粮食和油料等加工企业应当有计划地向农村分散。（3）今后还要在城市继续进行生产的粮食和油料等加工企业，应当把自己的副产品及时地供应附近的农村喂猪，不要远程运送。（4）国家卖给缺粮农民的粮食应当全部改为原粮，由他们自己加工。（5）糠麸和其他粮食、油料的加工副产品应当由合作社进行合理的分配，他们的出售价格应当尽量降低。（6）国家在统购粮食的时候，必须根据当地留粮的标准，给农业生产合作社社员和个体农民留足饲料；今后增加生猪所需的饲料应当在粮食的增产部分中解决。
    对青饲料的安排：（1）应当发动合作社社员和个体农民充分利用和广为收集当地现有的青饲料。（2）应当根据当地的自然条件，大量发展水浮莲、牛皮菜等高产量的青饲料作物的生产。（3）在青饲料不足的地区，合作社应当根据社员养猪的需要，给社员留出必要数量的饲料用地，增产青饲料。
    长江以南的各省、北方的山区和其他地广人稀的地区青饲料比较丰富，应当大量养猪。
    二、必须认真改正价格政策和收购制度中一切妨碍生猪生产发展的缺点和错误，使国家的价格政策和收购制度能够充分发挥刺激生猪生产的应有作用。根据农业合作化以后，生猪生产已经发生变化、养猪成本已经提高的新情况，国家决定对生猪的收购价格，在全国范围内作较大幅度的提高，由于1956年上半年各地收购价格有的已经提高，有的还未上提，各地应当分别不同情况，有的少提有的多提（各省提价的具体幅度，由国务院有关部门另行规定）。但是，所有地区都应当使提高后的收购价格能够确实保证农民养一头肥猪，必须有一定的利润，以刺激生猪的发展。同时，国家决定缩小地区之间的收购差价，交通不便地区生猪外运的费用，在地区差价缩小以后由国家负担一部分。收购价格提高以后，决定把农村、城市的销售价格略予提高，并把屠宰税予以降低，以便于合理地安排价格，有利于价格政策的贯彻执行。为了彻底克服收购工作中的压级压价的恶劣现象，国家商业部门应当规定验收生猪品质标准的公差，奖励验级准确，惩罚压级压价，提高收购人员的验收技术，加强对收购人员的政治教育，认真培养同群众商量办事、听取群众批评的优良作风。农民出售的肥猪，由食品公司统一收购或委托供销合作社收购。今后收购的肥猪，每头给养猪农民留肉八斤到十五斤，发给一年有效的证明，凭证供应。
    三、农业生产合作社对生猪生产的发展，必须加强组织领导，作好统筹安排。为着贯彻执行“私有、私养、公助”的方针，合作社应当帮助社员作好养猪规划，安排猪的饲料，收购猪的粪肥，并且留出时间，给以便利，使社员能够进行生猪的饲养。供应饲料和收购猪粪的价格，应当合理地兼顾社员的个人利益和合作社的集体利益。合作社应当根据社内社外发展生猪的生产计划，按比例地饲养公猪和母猪，繁殖仔猪。在认真执行生猪私养为主的方针的同时，有条件养猪的合作社应当适当地进行集体养猪。
    四、全国的国营农场应当积极地发展养猪生产，逐步地建立大量养猪的基地。
    五、大城市的机关、部队、学校、企业的伙食单位，应当在节约粮食的原则下，把剩汤剩菜供给附近农民，同农民伙养生猪。大城市郊区和中小城镇的上述伙食单位，凡有条件的都可以自己养猪。
    六、加强对生猪的防疫和治病的工作，减少生猪的死亡。责成各地农业管理部门制定防治猪病疫的规划，同生猪收购单位和农业生产合作社互相配合，经过典型示范，逐步推行防治工作。
    七、各县应当由农业部门、粮食部门和商业部门共同组织生猪生产指导委员会，负责生猪的生产购销、饲料供应和疫病防治等项工作。
    八、本决定不应当在信仰伊斯兰教的少数民族中执行。他们那里应当根据当地的条件，发展牛、羊、马、驴的生产。
