Contributing to the Construction of Our Country
Wang Mingxuan's Speech
    I warmly support Chairman Mao's instructions at the Supreme State Conference on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, Premier Zhou Enlai's report on his visit to eleven countries in Europe and Asia, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the report of the Learning Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on the work summary of the short-term study class for industrialists and businessmen, and Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of some issues concerning the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan. I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support them, and I will resolutely implement them in my future work.
    I feel infinitely excited and happy to attend the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as a nonvoting delegate this time. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has achieved brilliant accomplishments in various social reform movements, in safeguarding national security, in defending world peace, in mobilizing the people across the country to participate in political, economic, and cultural construction, in consolidating and expanding the united front organization, and in carrying out ideological remolding. In the future, in mobilizing and uniting the people of the whole country to accomplish the overall task of the country and in the struggle against enemies at home and abroad, our people's democratic united front will continue to play its role.
    Our country is a country with more than six hundred million people of various nationalities. Through various patriotic movements and ideological education, the awareness and understanding of our people have been improved, and there has emerged an unprecedented great unity of the people of the whole country in Chinese history. Our country's international status has also been raised to an unprecedented level. In particular, Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to eleven countries in Europe and Asia last year received grand welcomes and cordial consultations from various countries, and unanimous joint statements were made, expressing common desires and advocating peace.
    In recent years, more and more foreign dignitaries have visited China, which shows that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence diplomatic policy has gained the friendly sympathy of various countries. The countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union show internationalist solidarity and friendship and have made remarkable achievements in the world peace and democratic movement. We must work harder to win over the peace-loving people of all countries in the world, achieve even greater victories in the victory, and strengthen international close unity and friendship.
    Our country was in various bad situations for a long time before liberation. Industry and agriculture were very backward, and most people did not have enough to eat or wear, living a very poor and hard life under various oppressions. Since liberation, in the past few years, industrial and agricultural production has greatly exceeded the highest record in history, and culture, education, water conservancy, transportation, and various new constructions have been greatly developed, and people's lives have also been greatly improved, especially the lives of workers and peasants have been improved. All of us in the country must be more united and work harder, and under the instructions and calls of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, vigorously promote the fine tradition of increasing production and practicing economy, and building the country through diligence and thrift, and contribute our own strength to build our China into a socialist industrialized and highly cultural great country.
    Taiwan is our country's territory. We, the people of the whole country, must heighten our vigilance, strictly prevent sabotage by enemies at home and abroad, and actively contribute our own strength to support the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Fellow committee members, in recent years, our country's achievements have been great, and our socialist future is bright. Let us, the people of the whole country, unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, work harder, and strive for socialist construction.

    为建设我们的国家贡献力量
    王明选的发言
    我热烈拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题的指示和周恩来主席访问欧亚十一个国家的报告，陈叔通副主席的中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会第二届常务委员会工作报告，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会学习委员会关于工商业者短期讲习班工作总结的报告，李富春副总理关于第二个五年计划建议的若干问题的说明，我完全同意和衷心拥护，今后在工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    我这次列席中国人民政治协商会议，感到无限兴奋和愉快，中国人民政治协商会议在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，在各种社会改革运动中，在保卫祖国安全，保卫世界和平，在动员全国人民参加政治、经济、文化各方面的建设工作中，在巩固和扩大统一战线组织工作中，在进行思想改造工作中，都获得辉煌的成就。今后在动员和团结全国人民，完成国家总任务和反对内外敌人斗争中，我国人民民主统一战线，将继续发挥它的作用。
    我们国家是一个多民族六亿多人口的国家，经过各种爱国运动和思想教育，我国人民的觉悟认识都有所提高，出现了中国历史上从来没有的全国人民大团结。我国的国际地位也空前提高，特别是去年周恩来总理访问欧亚十一个国家，得到各国盛大的欢迎和亲切协商，一致取得联合声明共同愿望主张和平。
    几年来外国贵宾到中国访问者越来越多，显是五项原则和平共处外交政策取得各国的友好同情，以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营各个国家表现着国际主义的团结和友好，在世界和平民主运动方面都有显著成就。我们要更加努力，争取爱好和平的全世界各国人民，在胜利中取得更加的胜利，更加强国际上亲密团结友谊。
    我国的国家，解放前长期处在各种恶劣情况之下，工农业非常落后，人民大多数食不饱、穿不暖，在各种压迫下过着很贫穷艰苦生活。解放后，几年来工农业生产，大大超过历史上最高纪录，文化、教育、水利、交通运输，及其各项新建设，均有大量发展，人民生活亦大有改进，特别是工人农民生活有所提高。我们全国人民，必须更加团结更加努力，在中国共产党和毛主席指示号召下，极力提倡增产节约、勤俭建国的优良传统下，贡献自己的力量，来建设我们的中国，成为一个社会主义工业化、具有高度文化的伟大国家。
    台湾是我国领土，我们全国人民提高警惕，严防内外敌人破坏，积极贡献自己力量，支援和平解放台湾。各位委员，几年来我们国家成就是伟大的，我们社会主义前途是光明的。让我们全国人民更团结在中国共产党和毛主席周围，更努力工作，为社会主义建设而奋斗。
