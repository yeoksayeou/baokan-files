    Distinguish Right From Wrong and Successfully Pass the "Gate" of Socialist Transformation
    Speech by Gui Linqi
    I wholeheartedly endorse Chairman Mao's report at the Supreme State Conference, and endorse the reports of Premier Zhou and Vice-Chairman Chen Shutong. I would now like to express some opinions on the issues of understanding reflected in agricultural cooperativization in Anhui.
    "Greater Strength in Organization, No Fear of Famine"
    The first year of comprehensive cooperativization in our province was tested by severe natural disasters. Last year, the summer harvest suffered a severe drought of five months without a thorough rain. Afterwards, wheat was universally affected by rust. In June and July, there were nine consecutive heavy rainstorms, and the Jianghuai area suffered severe floods. At the beginning of August, the entire province suffered from a strong typhoon, followed by heavy rain and further flooding. If only the disaster-affected sowing area is calculated, the extent of the disaster would greatly exceed that of 1954. However, because the organized peasants fully exerted the collective strength, and after a series of tenacious battles of carrying water for planting, draining five floods, and planting five times, and harvesting in deep water, the losses from the disaster were greatly reduced. The disaster areas generally had certain harvests, and some even achieved maintaining production. In non-disaster areas, the high tide of cooperativization promoted an unprecedented movement of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, universally promoted the three reforms of agricultural production, and increased the production of grain crops alone by 4.1 billion jin. Because of the reduced losses in the disaster areas and the unprecedented increase in production in the non-disaster areas, the total grain output of our province in 1956 was 23 billion jin, exceeding the level of 22.7 billion jin in the bumper year of 1955, so that our province's grain was not only self-sufficient but also able to be transferred to support the urban industrial needs. Under such a great disaster situation, such achievements would be unthinkable without cooperativization.
    Due to the superiority of cooperativization, the difficulties of the people in the disaster areas of our province were greatly reduced compared to the past when disasters occurred, and the phenomenon of disaster victims flowing out was greatly reduced. During the 1954 flood, the people in the disaster area developed a large number of cooperatives to fight the disaster, and the state paid 120 million in relief funds, plus the Jianghuai water control earthwork funds, reaching 200 million, thus achieving the goal of not starving people to death in disaster relief, demonstrating the superiority of cooperativization and promoting the faster development of cooperatives. However, because universal cooperativization had not yet been achieved, the number of disaster victims flowing out still reached over 100,000. In 1956, due to the basic realization of advanced cooperativization, only 40 million in state relief funds were needed to achieve self-salvation through production, and the number of disaster victims flowing out was reduced to 50,000, many of whom were connected by relatives and friends to find work on construction sites in the Northwest and Northeast. That is to say, the organized peasants asked the state for four-fifths less relief funds in a disaster situation with a greater extent than in 1954, and the number of people flowing out due to the disaster was reduced by more than half. Isn't this the superior disaster resistance of cooperativization? Therefore, the disaster areas after cooperativization are not only vastly different from the situation before liberation, when a large number of disaster victims fled, died of illness, and starved to death, which could not be calculated, but also still have great differences from the early days of liberation. Therefore, the peasants in the disaster areas described the disaster before the establishment of the cooperative as "the water buffalo fell into the well, and there was strength but no way to use it," and the disaster after the establishment of the cooperative as "greater strength in organization, no fear of famine." They said: "In the past, when disasters occurred, we fled and begged for food, and our wives and children were scattered; now, when disasters occur, every family is reunited, we have food and clothing, and everyone is busy with production." As for the lives of the people in the non-disaster areas, they have been further improved. After the autumn harvest distribution last year, building new houses, adding new clothes and quilts, and buying rubber shoes and thermos bottles were common in the disaster areas, and everywhere in the non-disaster areas. In many places, cloth tickets were not enough, and the supply of daily necessities was tight. According to the statistics of the provincial commercial department on rural sales, in 1955, each person had 17.85 feet of cotton cloth, 0.057 pairs of rubber shoes, 0.54 pairs of socks, 0.05 pieces of health shirts and trousers, and 0.88 pieces of soap; in 1956, each person had 20.06 feet of cotton cloth, 0.072 pairs of rubber shoes, 0.62 pairs of socks, 0.059 pieces of health shirts and trousers, and 0.93 pieces of soap. That is to say, in the disaster year of 1956, the sales volume of these major daily necessities exceeded that of the bumper year of 1955, and the purchasing power of rural disaster years exceeded the purchasing power of bumper years. Isn't this brought about by cooperativization? Therefore, some peasants said that the land reform made "the begging stick of many years burn the pot," and cooperativization made "the long-term workers of many years return to their nests." The broad masses of poor peasants and newly-upper, lower-middle peasants, and old-lower middle peasants, although sometimes feel some imperfections, but when they recall the lack of food and begging for food, the debt of rent, the long-term workers outside, the Kuomintang's excessive fees, and the bandits robbing people before liberation, the five-fold suffering days are now gone forever, and they are always smiling. They do not have the feeling that "the peasants' lives are hard." Even some of the old upper-middle peasants who temporarily maintain production or reduce production, although they have some opinions and feel unaccustomed, also feel that now the days are "not surprised to knock on the door in the middle of the night," which is more stable and better than before liberation.
      "Everything is Difficult at the Beginning"
    In the earth-shaking agricultural socialist transformation, of course, some shortcomings and mistakes will occur. For example, in the process of establishing cooperatives, some cooperatives were established too large, the production teams were divided too large, and the production and management were not good; sideline occupations were once relaxed, and in some places, non-production expenses were too high, so that the members did not get more income; some cooperatives once had poor storage of cattle and farm tools; in some places, in the process of promoting production reform, there were phenomena of violating agricultural time and not choosing varieties; after the autumn harvest, some abundant production areas lacked education for members to "manage their families diligently and frugally," resulting in some waste; some cadres had a coercive and commanding style, and a very small number also had illegal and undisciplined corruption. All these shortcomings and mistakes have caused some losses, so that agricultural production has not been done better. However, the vast majority of peasants regard these shortcomings and mistakes as "everything is difficult at the beginning," "the first three feet are difficult to kick," which occurred in the absence of experience, many of which are unavoidable and must and can be overcome. In places where the rectification of the cooperative has ended, these shortcomings and mistakes have been basically overcome, and in places where the rectification is in progress, they are being overcome. Many households that originally requested to withdraw from the cooperative are now unwilling to withdraw during the rectification process. After comparing the superiority and shortcomings of cooperativization in many places, the peasants believe that "peasants who are illiterate or have little literacy can actually establish cooperatives and do a good job in one year, completely digging out the root of poverty, which is a remarkable achievement," "without the leadership of the Party, it is impossible to do it." They believe that "as long as they run for three or five years, they will definitely run the cooperative well," and their lives will "gradually become prosperous."
    Who is the "Criminal of the Times"?
    However, some people have different views from the peasants. They deny that the achievements of cooperativization are the main ones, saying that "the peasants are suffering" and "the cadres are bad." In a series of letters to the person in charge of the provincial CPPCC, a social figure in our province said, "Mencius said, 'With constant property, there is constant heart; if there is no constant heart, there will be extravagance and licentiousness, and there is nothing that will not be done.' Public property is not individual constant property, so the peasants' lives are not enough." He further said, "Now the high tide has reached the point of flooding, and if we do not rescue it urgently, we will be betraying the country and the people, and we will all become criminals of the times." Obviously, his so-called "disaster" refers to the socialist upsurge that has submerged the exploitation system, and he is openly opposed to cooperativization. In addition, two other people spoke at a study meeting convened by a municipal CPPCC, believing that "the rural cadres are now all hooligans and rascals who have ruined things, and the landlords and rich peasants have been well reformed through labor," "they can also lead." It is also very obvious that they indiscriminately attack the grassroots cadres, and consciously or unconsciously want the landlords and rich peasants to take leadership positions in the countryside. Of course, these people are unwilling to admit that cooperativization has advantages.
      Cannot Take False Appearances as Essence
    Of course, only a very small number or individual people have hostile emotions towards socialist transformation as described above. The vast majority of people inside and outside our Party who hold different views on cooperativization and peasants are due to the lack of in-depth contact with rural realities, only influenced by the emotions of some wealthy peasants among relatives and friends, hearsay, and echoing others, or only contacting superficial phenomena and individual phenomena, but not seeing the essence and universal phenomena of the problem, thus taking an isolated tree as a forest and taking false appearances as essence. They only see the temporary maintenance or reduction of production of a few wealthy peasants, and do not see the increased income and improved lives of the vast majority of peasants; they only see some differences in the lives of peasants and workers, and do not see the great differences in the lives of peasants themselves before and after liberation; they only see the differences in income between workers and peasants, and do not see the differences in living expenses between cities and villages; they only see some failures in production reform, and do not see the large number of successes in production reform; they only see the coercive orders of some grassroots cadres and individual violations of law and discipline, and do not see the day and night diligence and active work of the vast majority of grassroots cadres; they only see the shortcomings and mistakes that occur in work, and do not see that all work is constantly advancing in overcoming shortcomings and mistakes. In short, they only see shortcomings and mistakes, and do not see achievements, or they confuse unnecessary praise and merit with realistically affirming achievements. All these different views are issues of right and wrong within the people.
    Chairman Mao instructed us at the Supreme State Conference to distinguish right from wrong and correctly handle contradictions among the people. We will follow Chairman Mao's teachings, and deeply convey the spirit of this Supreme State Conference and the National Committee of the CPPCC to the provincial CPPCC, so as to implement it among the masses of all parties, factions, and circles, and solve the problem of contradictions among the people according to the principle of "starting from the desire for unity, reaching the goal of unity through criticism and struggle." We firmly believe that with Chairman Mao's clear and thorough instructions as a weapon, some different opinions inside and outside our Party will surely be unified, the boundaries between right and wrong will surely be distinguished clearly, and we will surely be able to help each other, supervise each other, affirm achievements, and correct mistakes, and successfully pass the gate of socialist transformation. We will continue to move forward in the direction of socialism with full confidence and unity. (Attached picture)

### 明辨是非，过好社会主义改造这一“关”  桂林栖的发言

    明辨是非，过好社会主义改造这一“关”
    桂林栖的发言
    我衷心拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上的报告，拥护周总理和陈叔通副主席的报告。我现在就安徽的农业合作化中所反映出的认识问题，发表一点意见。
    “组织起来力量大，灾荒也不怕”
    我省全面合作化的第一年就遭受了严重的自然灾害的考验，去年午季遭受五个月未下过透雨的大旱灾，以后小麦又普受疸灾，六、七月连续九次大暴雨，江淮均遭受严重的涝灾，八月初全省普受一次强台风袭击，接着又是大雨，复受涝灾。如果仅从受灾播种面积计算，灾情的广度还要大大超过1954年。但因组织起来的农民充分发挥了集体的力量，经过挑水点种，五涝五排，四淹五种，深水抢收等等一系列的顽强战斗，就大大减轻了受灾的损失，灾区一般都有一定的收成，还有达到保产的，在非灾区，由于合作化的高潮推动了空前未有的兴修水利和积肥运动，普遍推动了农业生产的三项改革，仅粮食作物就增产四十一亿斤。由于灾区减少损失和非灾区的空前增产，使我省1956年的粮食总产量为二百三十亿斤，超过了丰收的1955年二百二十七亿斤的水平，使我省粮食不仅能够自给，还能够外调支援城市工业的用粮需要。在这样大的灾情下面，有这样的成绩，离开合作化是不能设想的。
    由于合作化的优越性，我省灾区人民较过去受灾时困难大大减轻了，灾民外流现象大大减少了。1954年水灾，当时灾区人民为了抗灾，就发展了一大批合作社，国家又支付一亿二千万的救济款，连同江淮治水土方经费达两亿之巨，因此做到了救灾不饿死人，显示了合作化的优越，推动了合作社的较快发展。但因尚未普遍合作化，灾民外流仍达十万以上。1956年由于基本上实现了高级合作化，只需国家支援四千万的救济款，就做到生产自救，灾民外流的减少到五万，其中有许多是由亲朋串连到西北、东北工地找工做的。就是说，组织起来的农民在灾情广度还要大于1954年的情况下，向国家少要了五分之四的救济款，而因灾外流人数还减少了一半以上。这不是合作化的抗灾优越性么？所以合作化以后的灾区，不仅和解放前灾民大批外逃、病死饿死无法计算的情况有天壤之别，就是和解放初期仍有很大差异。因此，灾区农民形容办社以前受灾，是“水牛掉在井里，有力无法使”，办社后受灾是“组织起来力量大，灾荒也不怕”。他们说：“过去受灾，逃荒要饭，妻离子散；现在受灾，家家团圆，衣食有着，大家忙生产”。至于非灾区人民的生活，就进一步地改善了。去年秋收分配后，翻盖新屋，添置新衣新被，买胶鞋热水瓶的，在灾区间也常有，在非灾区到处可见，不少地方因此布票不够，日用百货供应紧张。据省商业部门就农村销售量的统计，1955年每人是棉布十七点八五尺，胶鞋零点零五七双，袜子零点五四双，卫生衫裤零点零五一件，肥皂零点八八块；1956年每人是棉布二十点零六尺，胶鞋零点零七二双，袜子零点六二双，卫生衫裤零点零五九件，肥皂零点九三块。就是说在1956年受灾年份这几种主要日用百货的销售量都超过了丰收的1955年，农村受灾年份的购买力超过了丰收年份的购买力，这不是合作化带来的么？所以有的农民说，土改使“多年的要饭棍烧了锅”，合作化使“多年的长工归了窝”。广大贫农和新上、下中农、老下中农，虽然有时也感到有些美中不足，但一回想起解放前的缺粮讨饭的多，欠租背债的多，在外面打长工的多，国民党的夫费多，土匪抢人的多，那种五多的苦难日子，现在是一去不复返了，总是眉开眼笑的，他们并没有“农民生活苦”的感觉。就是老上中农中的一些暂时保产户或者减产户，他们虽然有些意见，感到不习惯，也觉得现在日子是“半夜敲门不吃惊”，比解放前安稳好过。
      “万事起头难”
    在翻天覆地的农业社会主义改造中，当然会发生一些缺点和错误。例如在办社过程中，有些社办得过大，生产队划得过大，生产经营管理不善；一度放松了副业，有些地方非生产开支过多，使社员未能得到更多的收入；有些社曾一度对耕牛农具保管不好；有些地方在推行生产改革中，有违背农时，不择品种现象；秋收后有些丰产区对社员的“勤俭持家”教育不够，发生若干浪费；某些干部有强迫命令作风，极少数还有违法乱纪贪污行为。所有这些缺点和错误，都曾造成某些损失，使农业生产未能搞得更好。但绝大多数农民把这些缺点和错误，看作是“万事起头难”，“头三脚难踢”，是在没有经验情况下发生的，有许多是难免的，是必须和可以克服的。目前整社已经结束的地方，这些缺点和错误已经基本上被克服了，正在整社的地方则正在克服中。原来要求退社的户在整社过程中有许多又不愿退社了。许多地方的农民把合作化的优越性和缺点作了比较之后，认为“不识字和识字很少的农民，在一年之内，居然能够把合作社办起来，办得好，彻底挖掉了穷根，这是了不起的大成绩”，“没有党的领导，是万万做不到的”。他们相信“只要办过三年、五年，一定会把社办得很好”，他们的生活，将会“逐年富裕起来”。
    谁是“时代罪人”？
    但是有些人却和农民看法不一样，他们否认合作化的成绩是主要的，说“农民苦”，说“干部坏”，我省一位社会人士给省政协负责人的历次信件中，他说，“孟子说，‘有恒产则有恒心，苟无恒心，放僻邪侈，无不为矣’，公有产不是个人恒产，所以农民生活不够”。他还进一步说什么“现在高潮已到泛滥成灾的时候了，若不急救，我们就是负国负民，都成了时代罪人了”。很明显，他的所谓“灾”，就是指社会主义高潮淹没了剥削制度，他是公开反对合作化的。另外，还有两位人士在一个市政协召集的一次学习会上发言，认为“现在农村干部都是流氓地痞，把事情办坏了，地主富农分子经过劳动，已改造得很好”，“他们也能领导”。又很明显，他们不加区别地攻击基层干部，也是自觉或不自觉的想让地主、富农在农村担任领导。这些人当然都是不愿承认合作化有优越性的。
      不能把假象当本质
    当然像上面所述对社会主义改造有敌对情绪的人只是极少数或者个别的人。我们党内党外对合作化和农民持有不同看法的人，绝大多数是由于没有深入接触农村实际，只是受亲朋中一部分富裕农民情绪的影响，道听途说，人云亦云，或者只是接触到表面现象、个别现象，而没有看见问题的本质和普遍现象，因而把孤树当森林，把假象当本质。他们只看见少数富裕农民暂时的保产或减产，看不见广大农民增加收入和生活有所改善；只看见农民和工人生活上的某些差别，看不见农民自身在解放前和解放后生活上的很大差别；只看见工人和农民收入上的差别，看不见城市和乡村生活开支的差别；只看见生产改革中的某些失败，看不见生产改革中的大量成功；只看见部分基层干部的强迫命令和个别的违法乱纪，看不见绝大多数基层干部的日夜勤劳、积极工作；只看见工作中发生的缺点和错误，看不见各项工作都是在克服缺点和错误中不断前进。总之，是只看见缺点错误，看不见成绩，或者是把不必要的歌功颂德和实事求是地肯定成绩混淆起来。所有这些不同看法，都是人民内部的是非问题。
    毛主席在最高国务会上指示我们，要明辨是非，正确处理人民内部的矛盾。我们将遵从毛主席的教导，将这次最高国务会议和全国政协委员会会议的精神，向省政协作深入的传达，从而贯彻到各党、各派、各界群众中去，将根据“从团结愿望出发，经过批评和斗争，达到团结目的”的方针来解决人民内部矛盾问题。我们坚决相信，有毛主席这次明确而又透彻的指示作为武器，我们党内党外某些不同意见一定能够统一起来，是非界限一定能够辨别清楚，我们一定可以在互相帮助，互相监督，肯定成绩，改正错误的情况下，过好社会主义改造这一关，我们将满怀信心团结一致地朝着社会主义方向继续前进。（附图片）
