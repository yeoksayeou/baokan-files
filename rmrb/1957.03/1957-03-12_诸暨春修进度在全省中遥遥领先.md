Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 11th: Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province, has been leading all eighty-plus counties in the province in water conservancy construction progress since last winter. The county plans to build nearly four thousand large and small water conservancy projects from last winter to this spring, using more than 5.3 million cubic meters of earth and stone. Currently, the county has completed 1,067 large and small water conservancy projects, with 1.85 million cubic meters of earthwork.

The Sanjiang Parallel Channel Straightening Project in Fengqiao is currently the largest water conservancy project in Zhuji County, with approximately nine thousand farmers working there despite the spring cold. The Pujiang River, known as the "Little Yellow River," has six major cut-off and bank protection projects. In Diankou, people proudly praise a project that "makes the high mountain bow its head." A small mountain has been opened up, dug into a 167-meter long, 5-meter wide, and 20-meter high water passage. In addition, there are many reservoirs and other water conservancy projects.

Zhuji County has built a total of 44,864 large and small water conservancy projects in the past six years, using more than 16 million cubic meters of earthwork. These water conservancy projects have increased the county's irrigated area by more than 40,000 mu, improved the irrigated area by 250,000 mu, and increased the average drought resistance capacity of each mu of farmland from more than 20 days to 39 days. Therefore, in 1956, the county's double-cropping rice area increased from 9,000 mu in 1949 to 260,000 mu, and the county's total rice output increased by 70% compared to 1949. After the completion of the county's water conservancy plan from last winter to this spring, the average drought resistance capacity of each mu of farmland will be increased to 45 days. Among the county's 730,000 mu of cultivated land, the area with drought resistance of less than 10 days will be reduced to only over 3,000 mu. This will provide a strong guarantee for further increasing grain production this year.

    诸暨春修进度在全省中遥遥领先
    新华社杭州11日电　浙江省诸暨县兴修水利的进度，从去年冬季到现在一直在全省八十多个县中遥遥领先。这个县计划在去冬今春兴修大小水利工程近四千处，用土、石方五百三十多万公方。目前全县已经完成大小水利工程一千零六十七处，土方一百八十五万多公方。
    枫桥三江并道取直工程是目前诸暨县最大的水利工程，大约有九千多农民冒着春寒在那里施工。被称为“小黄河”的浦阳江，有六处较大的截弯取直和护岸工程。在店口，人们自豪地称道着一处“让高山低头”的工程。一座小山被打开了，挖成一百六十七公尺长、五公尺阔、二十公尺高的过水通道。此外，还有许多水库和其他水利工程。
    诸暨县在过去六年内共修成大小水利工程四万四千八百六十四处，用土方一千六百多万公方。这些水利工程使全县增加灌溉面积四万多亩，改善灌溉面积二十五万亩，平均每亩农田的抗旱能力从二十多天提高到三十九天。因此，1956年全县双季连作稻的面积从1949年的九千亩增加到二十六万亩，全县水稻总产量比1949年增加70％。这个县去冬今春兴修水利的计划完成以后，平均每亩农田的抗旱能力将提高到四十五天。在全县七十三万亩耕地中，抗旱能力不到十天的将减少到只剩三千多亩。这就可以为今年进一步增产粮食提供有力的保证。
