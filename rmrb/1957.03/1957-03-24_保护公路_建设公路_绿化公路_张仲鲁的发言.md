　　I fully endorse Chairman Mao's instructions, Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Li's reports, and Vice Premier Chen's speech on increasing production and practicing economy. I also agree with Vice Chairman Chen's work report on the Standing Committee.

　　Since liberation, China's highways have greatly developed, from more than 70,000 kilometers to more than 220,000 kilometers. Taking Henan Province as an example, when we took over after liberation, there were only more than 400 kilometers of relatively complete highways that could be used by cars. After several years of restoration and new construction, the province's highways have now developed to more than 14,000 kilometers. This cannot but be attributed to the strong leadership of the Party and government and the strong support of the masses. Of course, the active efforts of all employees are also an important factor in the development of highways. Now I would like to talk about some superficial experiences and opinions on highway construction, and ask all members and comrades to give criticism and correction.

　　(1) Paying attention to auxiliary roads while building highways

　　Most of the highways built in the past were widened and straightened by using existing cart tracks. After the highway is built, it is, of course, necessary to prohibit the movement of civilian iron and wooden wheeled vehicles, otherwise, the road surface and bridges will soon be damaged. If repairs are not frequently added, cars either cannot drive at all, or can barely drive but the speed cannot be increased, and fuel consumption is serious, thereby increasing transportation costs and shortening the life of cars, which will inevitably cause unnecessary waste and loss of manpower and funds to the country. Since the old roads have been rebuilt into highways and the large number of civilian iron and wooden wheeled vehicles are not allowed to travel, this not only hinders the farmers' cultivation, but also is not conducive to transportation. In Henan, due to the lack of modern means of transportation, more than half of the province's land freight still relies on backward tools. Since highways prohibit them from traveling, the opening and maintenance of auxiliary roads has become very necessary. However, there are still many highways that do not have auxiliary roads. Many highways nominally prohibit iron and wooden wheeled vehicles, but in reality, those who prohibit them prohibit them, and those who travel travel, and gradually it becomes a state of anarchy. This not only affects the integrity of the highway, but also affects the relationship between the masses and the road authorities. In order to correct this situation, auxiliary roads should be universally added on one side of the highway (except in areas without iron and wooden wheeled vehicles). New highways should consider auxiliary roads at the same time.

　　(2) Highway construction must consider the coordination of automobiles

　　Henan Province has many plains and few mountains. There are a large number of iron and wooden wheeled vehicles in the rural areas of the plains. In the current situation of insufficient advanced transportation tools, these iron and wooden wheeled vehicles can form a large transportation army and play a great role in short-distance transportation. Freight within the county can be fully borne by it, so roads within the county, unless they are national or provincial highways, do not need to be urgently converted into highways. If it is converted into a highway, there must be enough cars to cooperate, otherwise, the highway will be built, iron and wooden wheeled vehicles will also be prohibited, and cars will not be able to cooperate, wouldn't it be a waste of manpower and a stagnation of freight? When I inspected work in the Nanyang area, the masses reflected: "We have built the road, and our cars are not allowed to travel, and your cars are not coming. If you ask us to build roads again in the future, we will not do it." This fully illustrates the necessity of automobile coordination with highways. Within a few years, the supply of cars will not be able to meet the requirements. Short-distance transportation still needs to rely on civilian tools, so what is the need to urgently rebuild roads within the county into formal highways?

　　(3) Should highway maintenance rely on the masses or on road maintenance teams?

　　Building highways is important, and maintaining highways is equally important. It generally costs 20,000 to 30,000 yuan to build one kilometer of gravel pavement, and 4,000 to 5,000 yuan to 10,000 to 20,000 yuan for dirt roads without gravel. If the gravel pavement is not maintained, when the traffic density is slightly larger, the road surface will be loose and broken in as little as four or five months and as long as less than a year, making it difficult to repair. Dirt roads need to be leveled more often. Highway workers often have the idea of "emphasizing construction over maintenance," so that after the road is built, they neglect maintenance, or the maintenance is not good, and the life of the road cannot be reasonably extended, thus causing unnecessary losses to the country. Highway maintenance generally uses road maintenance teams, and some use a combination of road maintenance teams and mass maintenance, while relatively few rely solely on mass maintenance. The masses in Henan generally have the tradition and enthusiasm for road maintenance. Laying sand after rain and sweeping snow after snow have become traditional habits of the masses along the road. After the advanced agricultural cooperatives, the road maintenance organization was disrupted for a time, and is now gradually being re-established. The issues of scoring points and contracting work to households for road maintenance team members have been well resolved in some agricultural cooperatives. For example, the Yefushan Cooperative in Nanyang allocated 18 full laborers from the prescribed workdays to form a road maintenance team. The contracted work quota for each member was reduced from the general seven mu of land to three mu of land. The land allocated to the members is all near the highway. When there is work on the road, they go to the road at any time, and when there is no work on the road, they do field labor, but with road repair as the main task. Some road maintenance teams are very active in road maintenance work, but because the issue of scoring points has not been resolved, they have become passive, such as the Chang Zhanbiao team in Neixiang County. Some teams were very active and achieved results before the high tide of cooperation, but later, because the members' contracted work quota was not appropriately reduced, their work enthusiasm was not as good as before, such as the Guan Jianzhong team in Xiangcheng County. In short, if you want to give play to the enthusiasm of the mass road maintenance teams, you must first solve the existing problems. Scoring points and contracting work to households in agricultural cooperatives are the main problems that need to be solved.

　　Mass road maintenance has many benefits, and saving expenses is only one aspect. The 12 kilometers maintained by the Wang Zhenxiang Brigade in Nanyang were maintained by 42 full laborers drawn from the prescribed workdays from four townships along the road to form a road maintenance brigade. After they improved this section of road from a dirt road to a gravel and crushed stone pavement, it was also maintained smoothly and smoothly, even better than the sections of road with full-time road maintenance teams. The greening achievements are even more outstanding. Wang Zhenxiang has been selected as a national first-class road maintenance model and a national advanced highway producer. Each member of this team maintains a section of road that is 0.286 kilometers long, that is, every 3.5 people maintain one kilometer. In other highways with more road maintenance teams, each person has to maintain at least 1.2 to 1.8 kilometers, and just relying on this strength alone, without the cooperation of the mass road maintenance teams, it is absolutely impossible to maintain the highway well. If you rely solely on the road maintenance teams to maintain the highway well, the state will have to spend a lot of money. Therefore, mass maintenance should be regarded as a correct direction for highway maintenance. This year is the year when we will reverse the idea of "emphasizing construction over maintenance" and vigorously promote mass maintenance. We must work hard in this area to achieve some results.

　　(4) It is necessary to emphasize the construction of mountain roads

　　Although Henan Province is mostly plains, it has the Funiu Mountains in the southwest, the Dabie Mountains in the southeast, plus the Taihang Mountains in the north and the Tongbai Mountains in the south, so the mountainous area is also quite vast. Looking at the main mountainous area, the Funiu Mountains, the mountain products there are extremely rich. There are hundreds of common medicinal materials alone. Guan Zhong sold large carts of Xiping at the foot of the mountain for only four cents a catty. Atractylodes macrocephala was slightly more expensive at five cents seven li. Platycodon grandiflorum and Forsythia suspensa were only one or two jiao, and Cornus officinalis was only one yuan two or three. The villagers piled up 300,000 catties of Forsythia suspensa that had not yet been transported out. Other products such as cork, acorns, and tung seeds can all be collected in the millions of catties a year. Henan, which has always been considered to be bare, does not know that there are still 1.5 to 1.6 million mu of virgin forests sleeping deep in the Funiu Mountains, while the timber we use to build bridges and houses is either taken from the northeast thousands of miles away or from the central south thousands of miles away. The mineral resources in the mountainous area have not been developed at all. The people in the mountainous area are holding these large amounts of wealth, but they are living in extreme poverty. In the old society, they could not afford salt for a long time, so that they lacked iodine and their thyroid glands swelled. Goiter is a very common phenomenon among the people in the mountainous area. During the Anti-Japanese War, sometimes seven or eight catties of grain could only be exchanged for one catty of salt. Even after liberation, the cadres of the organs in Luanchuan County, a mountainous area, still could not light lamps for three days and could not eat salt for five days. There is so much wealth in the mountainous area, but the lives of the people in the mountainous area are so hard. It is really as the saying goes: "Begging for food with a golden bowl." The closed traffic in the mountainous area is one of the main factors of poverty in the mountainous area. In order to develop the mountain economy and improve the lives of the people in the mountainous area, opening up mountain roads and facilitating mountain traffic is an urgent task.

　　Last year, we restored and rebuilt seven highways leading to the mountainous area and built two new highways in the center of the mountainous area. When the Song (County) Luan (Chuan) 110-kilometer highway was completed and opened to traffic, the people along the route rushed to watch it, and everyone was cheering. In the days before the motorcade passed, many men, women, old and young waited on the roadside from dozens of miles away. I personally saw a 90-year-old woman and a 70-year-old woman waiting on the roadside for several hours. After the car arrived, they circled around and stroked it, and were extremely happy. An old man had been ill for many days. When he heard that the car was coming, he asked his grandson to help him up and said, "It is worth it to see the car pass through the mountains in this life, even if I die." When the motorcade was about to arrive in Luanchuan County, the masses lined up three miles away to welcome them, with gongs and drums blaring and firecrackers booming. When the motorcade arrived in the city, the city was empty, and the road was blocked. At that time, it was late, and dark clouds were all over. Thousands of people stood in the square, regardless of the rain, to participate in the conference. The situation was so enthusiastic that it was moving. After this highway was opened, various mountain products in the core of the Funiu Mountains can be smoothly transported out, and the living and production materials needed in the mountainous area can also be transported in at any time, which has played a great role in developing the mountain economy and improving the lives of the people in the mountainous area. This year, we plan to build several more highways in the mountainous area. During the second five-year plan period, we will strive to basically build a transportation network in the main mountainous areas of Henan, and the traffic in the mountainous area can be basically solved, and the appearance of the mountainous area will inevitably change greatly.

　　(5) Should the state directly invest, or should it mobilize the local masses to build?

　　In the past, most of the local highways were built using the state investment method. Experience has proven that this is a "spending more money and doing less work" method, rather than a "spending less money and doing more work" method. Under this method, everything must cost money, and nothing can be saved. Local cadres and engineering departments often have disagreements on the issue of the unit price of civilian workers, the issue of mobilizing and leading civilian workers, the issue of dividing responsibilities, the issue of subsidies for local cadres, the issue of subsidies for civilian tools, and many other specific issues that arise temporarily. It is difficult to resolve disputes, which hinders the progress of the project and affects the friendly unity between cadres and cadres and between cadres and civilian workers. If we change a method, in addition to the relatively high-level national and provincial highways that must be built with direct state investment, the remaining local roads can be handed over to the local authorities to be responsible for, and the masses can be mobilized to build them with diligence. The state will provide economic subsidies and technical guidance. In this way, the authority is unified, the command is flexible, the local people build their own roads, and they use them themselves after they are built. The enthusiasm and initiative of the masses are easily brought into play, and at the same time, the maintenance problem is easily solved. This is a "getting twice the result with half the effort" and "spending less money and doing more work" method, and it is also a working method of relying on the masses and following the mass line. It seems that it can be tried or promoted.

　　(6) How to green highways

　　Highway forests are planted a lot every year, and destroyed a lot every year. If the trees planted every year can achieve a certain survival rate, then the sides of the highways would have been shaded by green trees long ago. Taking Henan as an example, more than one million to two million trees are planted on highways every year. According to the current 14,000 kilometers of highways in the province, more than one hundred trees are planted per kilometer every year, and there should be a new tree every six or seven meters. Not counting the trees planted before liberation, just counting the six or seven years after liberation, there should be a tree every one or two meters. But after on-the-spot inspection, there are still many sections of road where there are no trees for a long distance. The 12-kilometer section of road maintained by Wang Zhenxiang, a national highway labor model, has large and small trees as dense as bamboo forests on both sides. He has turned the small gaps on both sides of the highway into small nurseries. In addition to planting his own, he also provides them to others for free. His section of road is densely planted, with four, five, or even seven or eight rows horizontally. Not only the sides of the road and the slopes, but also the side ditches and the ends of the fields are planted with trees. The longitudinal distance is sometimes no more than three or five inches. With such dense planting, they will not all die, and they will not all be destroyed. In the summer, the road surface is completely covered by trees, and the scorching sun has no way to show its power. We learn from his experience and should promote the mass maintenance teams along the road to use the gaps on the sides of the road to build more small nurseries and adopt dense planting methods to achieve the point where "they will not all die and will not all be destroyed." Then, within a few years, all highways can be completely greened.

　　Members, comrades! Highway construction cannot be carried out in isolation. It must be developed in conjunction with the development of industry and agriculture and other related conditions. The national general task during the transition period is in line with the facts, and the policy of corresponding development of transportation is very correct. Henan is located in the Central Plains. Although there are railways crisscrossing, the transportation tasks outside the railways are still very heavy. In Henan, less than 5% of the highways are paved, and it is difficult to complete the arduous transportation tasks. However, the people of Henan have a fine tradition of hard work and perseverance. They will definitely overcome all difficulties under the strong leadership of the Party and complete the national planned tasks. (Attached picture)

　　保护公路　建设公路　绿化公路
　　张仲鲁的发言
    我完全拥护毛主席的指示，周总理、李副总理的报告，和陈副总理关于增产节约的发言，并同意陈副主席关于常务委员会的工作报告。
    解放以来，我国公路有很大发展，从七万多公里发展到二十二万多公里。就河南省来说，解放时我们所接收的公路仅有四百多公里比较完整，可以畅通汽车，经过几年来的恢复和新建，现在全省公路已经发展到一万四千多公里了。这不能不归功于党政的坚强领导和群众的大力支持。当然全体职工的积极努力亦是公路发展的重要因素。现就公路建设，谈一些粗浅体会和意见，请各位委员和同志给以批评和指正。
　　（一）修建公路同时还要重视附路
    过去修建的公路绝大部分是利用旧有的大车道加以放宽并裁弯取直的。公路修成后，当然要禁止民间铁木轮车行驶，否则，路面和桥涵很快就被轧坏。如不常加整修，汽车或者根本不能行驶，或者勉强行驶而时速不能提高，油料消耗严重，因而加大运输成本，缩短汽车寿命，这就必然为国家造成人力和资金上不应有的浪费和损失。旧路既被改修公路而民间大量的铁木轮车又不准行驶，这不惟妨碍农民的耕作，亦且不利于运输。就河南讲，因为现代运输工具的不足，全省的陆路货运还有一半以上要靠落后工具来负担。公路禁止它们行驶，附路的开辟和养修就成为十分必要的了。但是，现在还有许多公路旁侧没有附路。许多公路上名为禁行铁木轮车，实际是禁者自禁，行者自行，渐渐就成为无政府状态了。这不惟影响公路的完好，亦且影响群众与路方的关系。为了纠正这种情况，应在公路一侧（无铁木轮车地区除外）普遍加建附路。新建公路应同时把附路考虑在内。
　　（二）修建公路必须考虑汽车配合
    像河南省平原多，山区少。平原地区农村有大量铁木轮车。在今日先进交通工具不足的情况下，这些铁木轮车可组成一支运输大军，在短途运输上，能起很大作用。县境以内的货运满可依靠它来负担，因而县境以内的道路，除非是国道、省道，就不必急于全改修为公路。如果改修为公路，就必须有足够的汽车来配合，否则，公路修了，铁木轮车亦禁止通行了，而汽车又配合不上，岂不是既浪费了民力而又窒息了货运吗？我在南阳地区检查工作时，曾有群众这样反映：“我们把路修好了，我们的车亦不让行驶了，而你们的汽车又不来，以后再叫修路，我们就不干了”。这充分说明，汽车配合公路的必要性。几年以内，汽车的供应还不能满足要求。短途运输依然须靠民间工具，那么，县境以内的道路还有什么必要把它急急改建为正式公路呢？
　　（三）公路的养护应该靠群众还是靠道班
    修建公路固然重要，养护公路亦同样重要。修建一公里碎石路面，一般需要两三万元，不铺碎石的土路亦须四、五千元至一、二万元。碎石路面如不加以养护，行车密度稍大时，短者四五个月，长者不到一年，路面即松散破烂，不易收拾。土路更须时加平整。公路工作者往往存在着
  “重修轻养”的思想，以致路修成后忽视养护，或养护不好而使路的寿命不能合理延长，因而造成国家不应有的损失。养护公路一般是采用道班，亦有采用道群合养的，专靠群众养护的则比较少。河南群众一般都有养路的传统和热情，雨后铺沙、雪后扫雪已成为沿路群众的传统习惯。农业高级合作化后，养路组织一度打乱，现正逐步重新建立。对于养路队员的记分及包工包产等问题在有些农业合作社内已经得到很好的解决。如南阳叶富山社，按建勤规定工日，抽出十八个全劳动力，组成养路队。每个队员的包工包产任务从一般的七亩地减低为三亩地。队员分配的地都在公路近旁。路上有活，随时上路，路上无活，就作田间劳动，而以修路为主。有的养路队对养路工作非常积极，但因记分问题未得解决，转趋消极，如内乡县常占标队即其一例。有的队在合作化高潮前原甚积极且著有成绩，后因队员包工包产任务未得适当减低，工作情绪便不如前，如襄城县关建中队是。总之，要想发挥群众养路队的积极性，首先应把存在的问题加以解决。农业社中的记分及包工包产就是须要解决的主要问题。
    群众养护公路，好处很多，节省经费仅其一端。南阳王振祥大队养护的十二公里是由沿路四个乡按建勤规定工日，抽出了四十二个全劳动力，组成养路大队。这一段路经他们从土路改善为碎石、磋石路面后，还养护得平整光滑，比设有专职道班的路段养得还好，绿化成绩更是突出。王振祥已被选为全国养路一等模范和全国公路先进生产者。这个队的每个队员养的路段为零点二八六公里即每三点五人养一公里。设置道班较多的其他公路，每人至少要养一点二至一点八公里，而且单靠这点力量，没有群众养路队来配合，是断断不能把公路养好的。如果单靠道班把公路养好，国家就须开支很大一笔经费。所以群众养护应被认为是公路养护的一个正确方向。今年是我们扭转“重修轻养”思想的一年，也是大力推动群众养护的一年，我们一定要在这方面努力做出一点成绩。
　　（四）必须强调山区道路的修建
    河南省虽说大部都是平原，然西南有伏牛，东南有大别，加上北部的太行，南部的桐柏，山区面积亦就相当辽阔。从主要的山区伏牛山看，那里的山产异常丰富，只普通药材就有一百几十种。管仲在山下通大车的西坪只卖四分钱一斤，苍术稍贵，是五分七厘，桔梗、连翘亦只一角、二角，山萸肉才一元二、三，乡人委堆积了三十万斤连翘还未运出。他如栓皮、橡子、桐子等一年都能收集上百万斤。一向被认为是童山濯濯的河南，哪知伏牛山深处还酣睡着一百五六十万亩的原始森林，而我们造桥盖房所用的木材非取自数千里外的东北，即来自千里迢迢的中南。山区的矿产一点也还没有开发，山区人民抱着这些大量财富，而却过着极为贫苦的生活。在旧社会里，他们长期吃不起盐，以致身上缺乏碘质而甲状腺涨大。大脖子在山区人民中是很普遍的现象。抗战期间，有时七、八斤粮才能换一斤盐，即解放后山区栾川县城的机关干部亦还有三天点不上灯、五天吃不到盐的。山区的财富那样多而山区人民的生活却那样苦，真如俗话所说：“托着金钵要饭吃”了。山区交通闭塞是山区贫困的主要因素之一。为了发展山区经济，提高山区人民生活，开辟山区道路，便利山区交通是刻不容缓的工作。
    去年我们恢复、改建了通往山区的七条公路，新建了山区中心的两条公路。当嵩（县）栾（川）一百一十公里公路建成通车的时候，沿线人民争奔观看，万众欢腾，汽车队通过的前几天就有许多男女老少从几十里外到路边等候。我亲眼看到一个九十岁和一个七十多岁的老大娘在路边等了几个小时，待车到后，她们环绕抚摸，极为高兴。有一老汉病倒多日，听说车到，让他孙子把他扶起，说：“这辈子看看山中通车，死了也是值得的”。车队将到栾川县城时，群众在三里外结队欢迎，锣鼓喧天，鞭炮齐鸣，车队到城里时，万人空巷，途为之塞。当时天色已晚，阴云四布，群众数千人，不顾雨淋，鹄立广场，参加大会，情况热烈，使人感动。这条公路修通后，伏牛山核心的各种山产可以顺利运出，山区需要的生活、生产资料亦可随时运入，这对发展山区经济，提高山区人民生活起了很大作用。今年还计划在山区再修几条公路，在第二个五年计划期间，河南主要山区的交通网争取可基本建成，山区的交通当可基本解决，山区的面貌自亦必随之大大改变。
　　（五）国家直接投资，还是发动地方群众修筑
    过去修建地方公路绝大部分是采用国家投资方式。经验证明，这是一种“花钱多，办事少”的方式，而不是一种“少花钱，多办事”的方式。在这种方式下，事事都须花钱，一点不能节省，地方干部与工程部门往往因民工单价问题，民工发动、领导问题，职责划分问题，地方干部补助问题，民间工具补贴问题以及其他临时发生的许多具体问题，意见不能一致，争执难以解决，妨碍工程进展，影响干部与干部间、干部与民工间的友好团结。假使改变一个方式，除下必须国家直接投资修筑的较为高级的国道、省道，其余地方道路可一律交由地方负责，发动群众建勤修筑，国家在经济上给以补助，在技术上给以指导。这样，事权统一，指挥灵便，地方上自己修路，修成后自己使用，群众的热情和积极性便易得到发挥，同时，养护问题亦易得到解决。这是一种“事半功倍”、“少花钱多办事”的方式，也是依靠群众走群众路线的一种工作方法，似乎是可以试用或推行的。
　　（六）怎样绿化公路
    公路林是每年种得多毁得亦多。如果每年所种的树能达到一定的成活率，那么，公路两侧早已绿树成荫了。以河南论，每年公路植树总是一百多万株到二百多万株。全省公路按现在的一万四千公里计，每公里每年即植有一百数十株，大约每六、七公尺即应有一株新树。解放以前种的不算，单以解放后的六、七年计，每隔一、二公尺亦应有树一株了。但是实地检查一下，还有很多路段，多远不见一树。全国公路一等劳模王振祥领导养护的十二公里路段，两侧大小树木密如竹林。他把公路两侧的小块隙地都辟成小型苗圃。每年除下自种，还免费供给别人。他的路段实行密植，横的四行五行乃至七行八行，不惟路侧、边坡，连边沟、地头也都种上了树。纵的距离有的也不过三寸五寸。像这样的密植，死也不会死完，毁也不会毁尽，一到夏天，路面全被树遮，烈日没法逞威。我们吸取他的经验，就应推动沿路群众养护队利用路侧隙地，多辟小型苗圃，采用密植办法，达到“死不完，毁不尽”的地步，那么，数年之内，所有公路都可全部绿化了。
    委员们，同志们！公路建设不能孤立地进行，必须配合工农业的发展以及其他有关条件来发展，过渡时期国家总任务对于交通运输相应发展的方针是符合事实的，十分正确的。河南地处中原，虽有铁路交叉，而铁路以外的运输任务仍很繁重。河南公路铺有路面的还不到5％，完成艰巨的运输任务是有一定的困难的。但是，河南人民具有艰苦耐劳的优良传统，他们一定能在党的坚强领导下，克服一切困难，完成国家计划任务。（附图片）
