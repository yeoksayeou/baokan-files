Soviet Conference on Polymers and Physics

Research on polymer compounds has been developing at a tremendous pace in scientifically advanced countries worldwide for the past two decades. Polymer compounds play a crucial role in industry, national defense, and the everyday necessities of life. The development of modern science and technology is inseparable from the research of polymer compounds.

The Polymer Compounds Committee of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Soviet Ministry of Higher Education held the Ninth Conference on the Chemistry and Physics of Polymer Compounds from January 28th to February 1st this year, reviewing and summarizing the work done in this scientific field in the Soviet Union in recent years. Representatives from eight countries, including Czechoslovakia, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, West Germany, Israel, Romania, Yugoslavia, and China, were invited to participate in the conference. The conference heard more than 184 academic papers presented by over 70 research units from the Soviet Academy of Sciences, defense departments, industrial sectors, universities, and factories. Foreign representatives also presented ten papers, including three from China.

The conference opened on January 28th, presided over by Academician Kargin. In his opening remarks, he stated that the future main direction is the synthesis of polymer compounds with specified structures artificially, therefore it is necessary to create new synthesis methods; and the latest instruments should be used to study the structure and properties of polymer compounds. After the opening ceremony, the conference was divided into six groups according to academic content, and presentations and discussions of papers were conducted for four and a half days. The spirit of free discussion was fully utilized at the paper presentation sessions, with deep and sharp debates unfolding between different opinions. Extremely heated academic debates were also carried out between different schools of thought, both theoretically and methodologically. As a result of the debates, some problems were resolved, but some problems could not reach a consensus in the end due to the incompatibility of the two sides' viewpoints.

In terms of the synthesis of polymer compounds, more papers were presented this time. Some were about the study of the synthesis of new polymer compounds, and some were about the study of the reaction mechanism and kinetics of the synthesis process. It can be seen from the reports that the Soviet Union is moving towards the direction of synthesizing polymer compounds with predetermined properties. A new synthetic rubber has been successfully manufactured, and its properties and molecular structure are very similar to natural rubber. It is obtained by polymerizing “isoprene” using a new organometallic compound as a catalyst. It can also be seen from the reports that introducing atoms of various elements into the molecules of polymer compounds may improve the properties of the polymer compounds. Most of this work is carried out under the leadership of Corresponding Academician Andrianov, Corresponding Academician Korshak, and Corresponding Academician Petrov, respectively. The Soviet Union has now synthesized polymer compounds containing elements such as silicon, titanium, aluminum, tin, and phosphorus. A fluorine-containing synthetic fiber has also been manufactured under the leadership of Professor Rogovin, and this fiber has high chemical stability. Regarding theoretical research, it can be seen from a large number of reports that the Soviet Union has also made great achievements. The school of Corresponding Academician Medvedev has solved the relationship between molecular structure and reactivity in the research of copolymerization and ionic polymerization; in the study of the polymerization reaction of "chloroprene," the existence of macromolecular free radicals was discovered. Medvedev also put forward a different view from Professor Yulzhenko on emulsion polymerization, he believes that the reaction takes place in the adsorption layer of soap. This issue was debated for a long time at the meeting. Professor Delgoplosk's research on the mechanism of free radical polymerization, especially on redox initiation systems, is of great practical significance. He used "benzoquinone," "sulfite," and "cumene hydroperoxide" as initiators and found a technological process suitable for production, which is now being used to produce synthetic rubber with superior properties on a scale of tens of thousands of tons.

In terms of the chemical properties of polymer compounds, the main work is focused on the study of rubber vulcanization. Professor Dogadkin et al. summarized their research results in a paper presentation, believing that the vulcanization process is mainly a free radical reaction, which includes two different directions of reactions: polymerization and cracking. This theory can be directly used to guide the production process.

In terms of the research on the structure of polymer compounds and the relationship between structure and properties, the Soviet Union has made very rapid progress. It can be seen from the papers reported at the conference that they have mastered the latest experimental techniques, such as using infrared and polarized infrared spectroscopy, electron microscopy, electron diffraction, X-rays, etc. to study the structure of polymer compounds, using ultracentrifuges, light scattering, birefringence, etc. to study the properties of polymer solutions, and using paramagnetic resonance to study free radicals, etc.

The aging of polymer compounds is a major factor that directly affects their properties. Studying the aging can further improve the performance of polymer compounds. The main research directions mentioned in this paper report are the effects of light, heat, and mechanical force on polymer compounds. Most reports point out that the aging problem is a complex chemical reaction with free radical properties. (Hu Yadong)

　　苏联高分子化合物和物理学会议
    关于高分子化合物的研究工作，最近二十多年来世界各科学先进国家都以极大的速度发展起来。高分子化合物，在工业、国防和生活日用必需品工业中都占着极重要的地位。近代科学技术的发展，同高分子化合物的研究也是分不开的。
    苏联科学院高分子化合物委员会和苏联高等教育部在今年1月28日到2月1日举行第九次高分子化合物化学和物理学会议，检阅并总结了最近几年苏联在这个科学领域中的工作。捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、德意志民主共和国、西德、以色列、罗马尼亚、南斯拉夫和中国八国代表应邀参加了这次会议。会议听取了苏联科学院、国防部门、产业部门、高等学校以及工厂等的七十多个研究单位的一百八十四篇学术论文报告。外国代表也提出了十篇论文，其中包括我国的三篇。
    会议于1月28日开幕，由卡尔金院士主持会议。他在开幕辞中说，由人工合成而具有指定结构的高分子化合物，是今后的主要方向，因此必须创造新的合成方法；并且要采用最新的仪器进行高分子化合物的结构和性能的研究。开幕式以后，会议按学术内容分为六组，进行了四天半的论文报告和讨论。在论文报告会上充分地发挥了自由讨论的精神，在不同意见之间展开了深刻而尖锐的争论，不同学派之间也从理论上和实验方法上进行了极其热烈的学术争论。争论结果，有些问题得到了解决，但是有些问题由于双方的观点不能相容，最后还不能得出一致的看法。
    在高分子化合物的合成方面，这次提出的论文比较多。有关于新的高分子化合物的合成的研究的，也有关于合成过程的反应机构和动力学的研究的。从报告中可以看出，苏联正在朝着合成具有预定性能的高分子化合物的方向迈进。一种新的合成橡胶已经制造成功了，其性质和分子结构同天然橡胶极相近，它是用一种新的金属有机化合物作为催化剂使“异戊二烯”进行聚合而得到的。从报告中还可以看出，在高分子化合物分子中引进各种不同元素的原子，就可能改进高分子化合物的性质。这方面的工作大部是在安德利安诺夫通讯院士、科尔沙克通讯院士和彼德洛夫通讯院士分别领导下进行的。苏联目前已经合成了含矽、钛、铝、锡、磷等元素的高分子化合物。一种含氟的合成纤维在罗果汶教授领导下也被制造出来了，这种纤维具有很高的化学稳定性。关于理论方面的研究，从大量的报告中可以看出，苏联也已经有很大的成就。梅德维捷夫通讯院士一学派，在共聚合方面和离子型聚合方面的研究解决了分子结构同反应能力的关系问题；在研究“氯丁二烯”的聚合反应过程中，发现了大分子游离基的存在。梅德维捷夫还在乳液聚合反应方面提出了同尤尔仁科教授不同的看法，他认为反应是在肥皂的吸附层中进行的。会议上对这个问题进行很久的争论。德尔格普洛斯克教授在游离基聚合反应机构方面，尤其是关于氧化还原引发系统的研究，具有很大实际意义。他利用“苯醌”、“亚硫酸盐”以及“异丙苯过氧化氢”为引发剂，找到了适合于生产的工艺过程，现在这已经成万吨地被用于生产性质优越的合成橡胶。
    在高分子化合物的化学性质方面，主要的工作集中在研究橡胶硫化问题。都格特金教授等在论文报告会上总结了他们的研究成果，认为硫化过程主要是游离基反应，其中包括聚合和裂解两种不同方向的反应，这个理论可以直接用来指导生产过程。
    在高分子化合物的结构、结构同性质的关系的研究工作方面，苏联的进展非常快。从会上所报告的论文中可以看出，他们已经掌握了最新的实验技术，如使用红外和极化红外光谱、电子显微镜、电子衍射、X射线等研究高分子化合物的结构，使用超离心机、光散射、双折射等研究高分子溶液的性质，使用顺磁其振法研究游离基等。
    高分子化合物的老化作用是直接影响其性质的主要因素，研究老化作用就可以进一步改进高分子化合物的性能。这次论文报告中提到的主要的研究方向是光、热和机械力对高分子化合物的作用。大部分报告都指出，老化问题是具有游离基性质的复杂化学反应。（胡亚东）
