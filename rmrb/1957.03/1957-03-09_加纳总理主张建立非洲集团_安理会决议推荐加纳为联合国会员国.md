Xinhua News Agency, Accra, March 8th: Ghanaian Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah, at his first press conference held after Ghana's independence on the 7th, advocated for the establishment of an African bloc.

A reporter asked about his plan to convene a Pan-African conference. He said that African territories should have an African character, and the only way to achieve this was to convene a meeting of seven or eight independent African nations. He suggested that participants could include Tunisia, Libya, Morocco, Ethiopia, Sudan, Egypt, Liberia, and Ghana. He expressed regret that Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Syria were not invited to the Ghana independence ceremony. He said he had hoped to invite these countries, but when the invitations were sent, Ghana was not yet independent. The invitations were issued by Britain, which had severed diplomatic relations with these three countries due to the situation in the Middle East.

When asked if Ghana would join the Asian-African group if it were approved to join the United Nations, he said that he believed that independent African countries should unite themselves before allying with other groups, so that Africa would not be submerged by other groups.

In answering another question, Nkrumah said that he would visit the United States, Canada, and India, and possibly the Soviet Union and China.

Xinhua News Agency, March 8th: New York dispatch: The United Nations Security Council unanimously passed a resolution on the 7th recommending the newly independent nation of Ghana for membership in the United Nations.

The Security Council made this decision because Ghanaian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Kwame Nkrumah wrote to the UN Secretary-General requesting Ghana's admission to the United Nations.

    加纳总理主张建立非洲集团
    安理会决议推荐加纳为联合国会员国
    据新华社阿克拉8日电　加纳总理恩克鲁玛7日在加纳独立以后举行的第一次记者招待会上，主张建立一个非洲集团。
    有记者问到他的召开一次泛非洲会议的计划。他说，非洲的领土应该具有非洲的性格，而做到这一点的唯一途径是召集七、八个独立的非洲国家举行一次会议。他提出会议参加者可以包括突尼斯、利比亚、摩洛哥、埃塞俄比亚、苏丹、埃及、利比里亚和加纳。他对没有邀请埃及、沙特阿拉伯和叙利亚参加加纳独立典礼表示遗憾。他说，他曾经希望邀请这些国家，但是在发出请柬的时候，加纳还没有独立。请柬是英国发的，而英国由于中东局势已经同这三个国家断绝了外交关系。
    有记者问他，加纳如果被批准参加联合国的话，它是否将参加亚非集团。他说，他认为，独立的非洲国家在同其他集团联盟之前，应该自己先团结起来，这样非洲才不致于被其他集团所淹没。
    恩克鲁玛在回答另一个问题的时候说，他将访问美国、加拿大和印度，也可能访问苏联和中国。
    据新华社8日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会7日一致通过决议，推荐新独立的国家加纳为联合国会员国。
    安全理事会作出这个决定，是因为加纳总理兼外交部长恩克鲁玛写信给联合国秘书长，请求让加纳加入联合国。
