Xinhua News Agency, 1st: Since the second half of 1956, hog production in some areas has begun to increase. According to preliminary statistics, by the end of 1956, there were approximately 95 million hogs raised nationwide, an increase of more than 10 million compared to June of the same year. Sichuan Province, which raises the most hogs, increased by nearly 2 million head by the end of last year compared to the first half of the year, reaching 20 million head in the province; Hunan Province increased by 1.2 million head; Henan Province increased by 740,000 head; and Hebei Province also reached 5,005,000 head, an increase of 1,160,000 head compared to 1955. Many provinces have also proposed targets for increasing hog production this year. At the February meeting of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, the Municipal Party Committee, and the County Party Committee secretaries, a plan was proposed to increase the number of hogs by another 1.28 million this year. Guangdong Province requires that the total number of hogs raised in the province this year reach 15 million; Jiangsu Province, which has the highest pig density in the country, also plans to reach 10 million hogs this year.
Since the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a special discussion on the issue of hog raising, the Party and government leading organs in many areas have strengthened their leadership over hog production, implemented the hog raising policy of "private ownership, private raising, and public assistance," increased the purchase price of live hogs, and promoted various experiences in solving feed problems. After Chairman Mao added an instruction to the hog raising experience of the Shimensong Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yanggu County, Shandong Province, and published it last year, it greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers to raise hogs.
Since last autumn, the Shimensong Township Agricultural Cooperative has supplied 7,200 piglets and more than 1,150 gilts and breeding pigs to 820 agricultural cooperatives in Yanggu, Shouzhang, Dong'a and other counties. According to statistics at the end of January, many agricultural production cooperatives in Yanggu, Shouzhang, Dong'a and other counties have also reached the level of raising one hog per household.

    四川湖南等省生猪产量增加
    据新华社1日讯  1956年下半年以来，部分地区的生猪产量已经开始增长。据初步统计，到1956年底全国各地共养猪九千五百万头左右，比同年6月份增加一千多万头。养猪最多的四川省去年年底比上半年增加近二百万头，全省达到了二千万头；湖南省增加一百二十万头；河南省增加七十四万头；河北省也达到五百万零五千头，比1955年增加了一百一十六万头。许多省份并且提出了今年增产生猪的指标。河北省在2月份的中共地、市、县委书记会议上提出今年再增加一百二十八万头的计划。广东省要求今年全省养猪累计达到一千五百万头；全国猪只密度最大的江苏省今年也计划达到一千万头。
    自中共中央八届二中全会对养猪的问题作了专题讨论后，不少地区的党政领导机关都加强了对养猪生产的领导，贯彻了“私有、私养、公助”的养猪方针，提高了生猪的收购价格和推广了各种解决饲料问题的经验。去年毛主席对山东阳谷县石门宋乡农业生产合作社的养猪经验，加了批语发表以后，大大地鼓舞了广大农民养猪的积极性。
    石门宋乡农业社，从去年秋季以来，已经供应给阳谷、寿张、东阿等县的八百二十个农业社猪仔七千二百多头，小母猪和种猪一千一百五十多头；据1月底统计，阳谷、寿张、东阿等县的许多农业生产合作社也已经达到每户养一头猪。
