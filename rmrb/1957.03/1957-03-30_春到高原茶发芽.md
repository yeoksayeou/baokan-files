    Spring Arrives on the Plateau, Tea Sprouts
    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 27th—The ten mu of tea seedlings, which were experimentally planted in Chayu, Changdu last year, have sprouted tender buds the size of melon seeds this spring.
    The Changdu Area People’s Liberation Committee decided last year to experimentally plant tea trees in the warm Chayu. When the tea seeds were transported there at the end of March, Tibetan and Han cadres in Sang’angqu Zong, students from Chayu Elementary School, and some members of the public and chieftains all happily participated in the tea planting work. During the dry summer, they repaired canals and carried water to protect the seedlings. In the winter, they covered the tea seedlings with straw for warmth and often fertilized and weeded them. Now, the tea seedlings have survived the first spring, summer, autumn, and winter of the plateau climate and have grown to be between ten and thirty centimeters tall.

    春到高原茶发芽
    新华社拉萨27日电  去年试种在昌都察隅地方的十亩茶树苗，今春已发出瓜子大的嫩芽。
    昌都地区人民解放委员会去年决定在温暖的察隅试种茶树，当3月底茶籽一运到，桑昂曲宗的藏族、汉族干部、察隅小学学生和一些群众、头人，都高兴地参加了种茶工作。夏季天旱，他们就整修水渠，担水保苗，冬天又给茶苗盖上稻草保暖，常常施肥除草。现在，茶苗度过了第一个春夏秋冬的高原气候，已经长到十到三十公分高。
