Marching Towards Science in a Planned and Organized Way
Li Zong'en Discusses Several Issues in the Medical Field's Advance Towards Science
Science is a collective endeavor, and everyone should enthusiastically and realistically do their job well. This is the primary condition for marching towards science; it is necessary to closely link various scientific departments and units, and strengthen unified leadership; pay attention to appropriately arranging current interests and long-term interests.

The Party and the government's call to march towards science is a great encouragement to scientists and young people. From the perspective of a medical administrative worker, I would like to talk about my experiences on several issues in the medical field's advance towards science. Please feel free to correct me.

(I)

First, I would like to talk about science as a collective endeavor, and the relationship between individuals and the collective in this endeavor.

Since the call to advance towards science was put forward, young people have enthusiastically responded to this call, and the scientific community has shown a vigorous atmosphere. This is a very gratifying phenomenon. However, due to limitations in their understanding of this call, different views have arisen, which has caused some confusion in the minds of at least some young medical workers. Among them, the more prominent issue of principle is the phenomenon of not being content with their current jobs. For example, some young medical workers, often without considering the needs of the work or their personal conditions, rush to apply for graduate studies and advance towards associate doctorates. Some doctors in hospitals despise medical work and are enthusiastic about burrowing in libraries and running to laboratories, and their concern and service attitude towards patients are not as good as before, so that patients reflect that the doctors' attitude is colder than before. Nurses in wards have raised opinions to their leaders, asking to clarify the direction of scientific advancement for nursing staff. Technicians in laboratories also demand to improve their education and prepare to apply for universities, believing that this is a path to scientific advancement. The enthusiasm of young people is very valuable, and I also believe that leaders at all levels must clarify the direction of scientific advancement for medical workers in different positions. However, I feel that it is necessary to clarify some basic understandings of the concept of "science" first, otherwise it will affect current business operations and fail to meet the requirements of advancing towards science.

We must recognize that current scientific work is a collective endeavor, and the close cooperation of various relevant staff is essential for the development of science. For example, in specific medical work, the close cooperation of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, technicians, nutritionists, administrative cadres, political workers, and janitors is the basic key to completing medical tasks. The results of patient diagnosis and treatment are the result of their collective labor. The research achievements of a medical expert must also include the diligent fruits of his young assistants. It can be seen that all personnel, experts, doctors, nurses, technicians, pharmacists, nutritionists, administrative cadres, political workers, and janitors engaged in the overall cause of medical science must love their jobs and constantly improve their work level in order to gradually improve the overall level of medicine. If we ignore the basic principle that science must be a collective endeavor and are not content with our current jobs, it will not only hinder the progress of medical science but also weaken our role in the collective.

Because science is a collective endeavor, the quality of individual work will inevitably affect the entire scientific achievement. Therefore, it is necessary to emphasize the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts in scientific work. It requires a serious and honest attitude towards every job; not being perfunctory or careless, and completing the tasks in one's own position in a down-to-earth manner. Only then can we talk about advancing towards science. For example, when we carry out the prevention and control of infectious diseases such as schistosomiasis japonica and malaria, we must collect a large number of numerical materials from the epidemic areas, analyze and synthesize them, find the laws of occurrence and development of these infectious diseases, and formulate reasonable prevention and control measures. If the staff who register these original materials in the epidemic areas are not serious about the numbers and fill out the forms casually, then even the best statisticians will not be able to deduce scientific conclusions by collecting these materials together. For example, when scientists are conducting experiments, if the work of their assistants and technicians is not meticulous and accurate, they will not be able to obtain correct experimental results.

Therefore, for young medical workers, doing their job well with enthusiasm and seeking truth from facts, and constantly seeking improvements in their work, is the primary condition for scientific advancement. I believe that we have a responsibility to further study, analyze, and use practical examples to explain the important significance of this issue to young people.

(II)

Secondly, I would like to talk about the relationship between various scientific departments and units, and the relationship between leaders and various units in this collective scientific endeavor. The relationship between scientific units is a horizontal connection, while the relationship between leaders and various units is a vertical connection.

Since science is a collective endeavor, various scientific departments and units must have coordinated steps and flexible and close cooperation in order to complete the task of this advancement. No matter what scientific research work is, the coordinated cooperation of relevant departments is necessary for it to be carried out well. For example, if we want to conduct research on the prevention and treatment of scarlet fever, not only medical research institutions must conduct research in bacteriology, pathology, and pharmacology, but also clinicians must assist from the aspects of diagnosis and treatment, and prevention and control institutions must cooperate from the aspects of epidemiology. And when conducting investigations, it is also necessary to have close cooperation from children's health institutions and health organizations in residential areas. Only with the close cooperation of various units can we find out the laws of occurrence and development of scarlet fever and formulate reasonable and feasible prevention and control methods. If, in the cooperation, some units consider that their own tasks are relatively heavy and cannot actively cooperate with the tasks proposed by other institutions, this will inevitably affect the advancement of the entire medical science team. Therefore, I believe that under the current conditions of human and material resources in our country, only by strengthening the coordination, division of labor, cooperation, and mutual exchange of resources among various scientific institutions can we give full play to the existing forces and conform to the principle of running science diligently and thriftily.

In order to better coordinate, there must be unified leadership. Under unified leadership, not only can the pace of various scientific institutions be consistent, but also the work arrangements of scientists can be more properly arranged. There are shortcomings in this regard now. For example, some experts receive requests from various parties to complete tasks. For example, some medical experts are required to be responsible for compiling advanced teaching materials for medical colleges, complete certain medical tasks, and also undertake special research work in a certain aspect. I am not saying that these requests cannot be made to them, nor am I saying that they are unwilling to complete these tasks. The problem lies in whether the different departments that arrange these tasks have jointly researched and uniformly arranged them. I believe that this practice of "thousands of threads from above, one needle below" cannot but harm these experts' planned and focused arrangement of their own work in some situations. This cannot be said to be a loss to the advancement of medical science.

Therefore, I deeply realize the important significance of the Party's call to advance towards science. Advancement means collective action that is organized, disciplined, and under unified arrangement, rather than working alone. This call can only fully exert its power under the guidance of socialist collective ideology.

(III)

Finally, I would also like to mention the issue of how to properly arrange current interests and long-term interests that exists in the advancement of medical science. For example, the masses currently only feel the urgent need for medical treatment, so pure medical tasks occupy the main strength of medical workers, which cannot but affect medical scientific research, which is a contradiction. For example, various places urgently need medical and health personnel, so various medical colleges and universities have to devote most of their efforts to training medical students and refresher students, which makes it difficult for the research work of some senior medical experts, who are currently few in number, to be carried out well. This is another contradiction. Medical treatment is to meet the needs of the people, and training and improving new forces is also what we need; and from a long-term perspective, scientific research cannot be ignored. Therefore, how to properly treat the contradictions between them requires us to study well. I believe that only under planned and unified leadership, on the basis of coordinated division of labor and cooperation, doing our current work well, and constantly improving the level of medical science is the basic condition for solving the relationship between long-term interests and current interests. As for how to fully embody the spirit of advancing towards science in specific work, we still need everyone to work hard.

    有计划有组织地向科学进军
    李宗恩谈医学界向科学进军中的几个问题
    科学是个集体的事业，每个人都应该热情地、实事求是地作好本岗位的工作，这是向科学进军的首要条件；必须密切各个科学部门、各个单位之间的联系，加强统一领导；注意恰当地安排目前的利益和长远的利益。
    党和政府提出向科学进军的号召，对科学家及青年们是极大的鼓舞。我愿意从一个医务行政工作者的角度，来谈谈对医学界向科学进军中的几个问题的体会，请各位指正。
                （一）
    首先，我想谈一下科学是个集体的事业，在这个事业中个人与集体的关系。
    当科学进军的号召提出以后，青年们踊跃的响应这一号召，科学界表现出蓬勃的气象，这是一个极为可喜的现象。但是由于他们对这一号召的认识上的限制，就产生了不同的看法，至少在有的青年医务工作者中，思想上引起了一些混乱。其中比较突出而带有原则性的问题，就是不安心于现在的工作岗位的现象。例如，有的青年医务工作者，往往不考虑工作需要，个人的条件，争先恐后的投考研究生，向副博士进军。医院中有部分医师，轻视医务工作，而热心于钻图书馆，跑实验室，而对病人的关心及服务态度就不如从前了，以致病人反映医师的态度较以往冷淡。病房的护士们向领导提意见，要求明确护理工作人员向科学进军的方向。化验室的技术员们亦要求提高文化，准备投考大学，认为这是向科学进军的途径。青年们的这种热诚是很可贵的，我也认为各级领导也必须明确在不同岗位上的医务工作者向科学进军的方向。但是在这里我感觉到应当首先解决的是对“科学”这一概念的几点基本认识有澄清的必要，否则会影响当前的业务工作，也达不到向科学进军的要求。
    我们必须认识到，现在的科学工作是一个集体的事业，必须是各种有关的工作人员密切配合才能使科学得到发展。譬如在具体的医疗工作中，医师、护士、药剂师、技术员、营养师、行政干部，政治工作人员及勤杂人员等的密切合作，是完成医疗任务的基本关键，病人的诊疗成绩，是他们集体劳动的结果。一位医学专家的研究成绩中，也必然包括他的青年助手们的勤劳果实。由此可见，必须要求从事医学科学的整体事业中的每一个工作岗位的人员、专家、医师、护士、技术人员、药剂人员、营养师、行政干部、政治工作人员、勤杂人员等，热爱他们自己的工作岗位，不断地提高工作水平，才能使整个的医学水平逐步提高。如果忽视科学必须是个集体事业的这一基本原则，不安心目前的工作岗位，则不但阻碍了医学科学的进展，也会减弱自己在集体中所起的作用。
    也就是因为科学是个集体的事业，个人工作的好坏也就必定会影响整个的科学成果。因此就必须强调在科学工作中要充分发挥每个工作者的实事求是的科学精神。要求严肃的、老老实实的对待每一件工作；不苟且、不马虎、脚踏实地的完成自己工作岗位上的任务，这样才能谈得到向科学进军。例如我们在进行日本血吸虫病、疟疾等传染病的防治工作的时候，就必须从疫区中收集大批数字材料，进行分析综合，找到这些传染病发生发展的规律，制订合理的防治措施。假如在疫区登记这些原始材料的工作人员，对数字不严肃，随便填表，则把这些材料收集在一起，任何第一流的统计学家都无法推算出科学的结论。再如，科学家在进行实验的时候，如果他的助手、技术员们的工作不细致，不准确，则他也无法得到正确的实验结果。
    因此对青年医务工作者说来，热情的、实事求是的作好本岗位的工作，不断求得工作上的改进，是科学进军的首要条件。我认为在这一方面我们有责任来进一步研究、分析、以及用实际事例来向青年们说明这一问题的重要意义。
                （二）
    其次，我想谈一下在科学的这个集体事业中，各个科学部门单位之间的关系及领导的关系。科学单位之间的关系是一个横的联系，而领导与各单位之间的关系是一个纵的联系。
    既然科学是个集体的事业，因此在科学进军中，各个科学部门及单位就必须有协调的步伐，灵活而密切的配合，才能完成这一进军的任务。不论是那一项科学研究工作，必须要有有关部门的协调合作才能很好地进行。例如我们要进行猩红热的防治研究工作，不但医学研究机构要在细菌学、病理学、药物学方面进行，也必须有临床学家从诊断、治疗等方面来协助，更须要防治机构从流行病学等方面来配合，而在进行调查时，还须要有儿童保健机构、居民地段的卫生组织的密切合作。只有在各个单位的紧密配合下，才能摸清猩红热这一传染病发生发展的规律，制订出合理而可行的防治办法。如果在配合中，有的单位考虑到本身任务比较重，对其他机构提出来的任务不能积极的配合，这样就对整个医学科学队伍的进军不能不有所影响。因此，我认为在我国现有的人力物力的条件下，唯有加强各科学机构间的协调分工合作，互通有无，才能充分发挥现有的力量，符合勤俭办科学的方针。
    为了更好的协调，就必须要有统一的领导，在统一的领导下，不但可以使各科学机构间的步调可以一致，而且还可以使科学家们的工作安排的更为妥善。现在在这问题上是有缺陷的。例如，有些专家，就从多方面接到要求他完成的任务。如有一些医学专家，要求他负责编写医学院的高级教材，要求他完成一定的医疗任务，也要求他负担某一方面的专题研究工作。我不是说不可以对他们提出这些要求，也不是说他们不愿意完成这些任务。而问题在于布置这些任务的不同部门之间是不是经过共同的研究，统一的布置安排。我认为这种“上面千条线、底下一根针”的做法，在某种情况下，就不能不损害这些专家有计划、有重点的安排他们自己的工作。这对医学科学的进军不能不说是一种损失。
    因此，我深刻的体会到，党所提出的向科学进军这一号召中，进军的重要意义。进军就意味着有组织地，有纪律地，在统一安排之下的集体行动，而不是单干。这一号召只有在社会主义的集体思想的指导下才能充分发挥它的力量。
                （三）
    最后，我还想提一下在医学科学进军中所存在着的如何恰当的安排目前利益和长远利益的问题。譬如，群众目前只感觉到医疗迫切的需要，因此单纯的医疗任务就占用了医务工作者的主要力量，而就不能不影响医学科学的研究工作，这是一个矛盾。又例如，各地迫切的需要医药卫生人材，因此各个医学院校不得不付出绝大部分的力量来培养医学生、进修生，这样就使得一些目前为数不多的高级医学专家们的研究工作难于很好的开展，这又是一个矛盾。医疗是为了满足人民的要求，培养和提高新生力量也是我们所需；而从长远利益来讲，科学研究工作也不容有所忽视。因此，如何恰当的来对待它们之间的矛盾是需要我们很好的来研究的。我认为只有在有计划的统一领导下，在分工合作的协调基础上，做好我们当前的工作，不断地提高医学科学水平，就是解决长远利益和目前利益的关系的基本条件。至于如何在具体工作中来全面体现向科学进军的精神，还须要我们大家来努力。
