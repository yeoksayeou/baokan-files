　　Guangdong Rural Areas' Veteran Soldiers
　　Actively Participate in Spring Plowing Production
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 23rd. More than five thousand veteran soldiers who returned to rural areas in Guangdong Province this year are now actively engaged in spring plowing production.

    These veteran soldiers returned to the countryside successively around the Spring Festival this year. Many veteran soldiers participated in production as soon as they returned to the countryside. Xu Guide, a veteran soldier from Aojiao Township, Huilai County, arranged a plan to participate in production with the help of local agricultural cooperative cadres three days after returning home. When he learned that the cooperative lacked funds for spring plowing production, he took the initiative to invest his savings of three hundred yuan into the cooperative.

    The Chinese Communist Party organizations, governments, and people in various parts of Guangdong Province regard the veteran soldiers who returned to their hometowns this year as a vital force in striving for increased agricultural production this year. When veteran soldiers returned to Hepu County and other places, the county head, the director of the conscription bureau, and others introduced them to the current agricultural production situation and the contributions made by veteran soldiers who had returned to their hometowns earlier on the agricultural front, urging them to carry forward the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army of hard struggle and close ties with the masses after returning to their hometowns, and to strive to overcome some of the difficulties that still exist in the countryside.

　  广东农村的复员军人
　　积极投入春耕生产
    新华社广州23日电　今年回到广东省农村的五千多名复员军人，目前都积极地投入了春耕生产。
    这批复员军人是今年春节前后陆续回到农村的。许多复员军人一回到农村就参加了生产。惠来县澳角乡复员军人徐贵德回到家三天，就在当地农业社干部的帮助下安排了参加生产的计划。当他了解到社里缺乏春耕生产资金后，主动地把自己积蓄的三百元投资入社。
    广东省各地的中共党组织、政府和人民群众都把今年回乡的复员军人看成是争取今年农业增产的生力军。复员军人回到合浦县等地时，县长、兵役局长等向他们介绍了当前农业生产的情况和早先回乡的复员军人在农业战线上所立下的功劳，要求他们回乡后发扬人民解放军艰苦奋斗、联系群众的优良传统，努力克服目前农村中尚存在的一些困难。
