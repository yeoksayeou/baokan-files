　　Unspeakable "Secrets"
　　On a scrap of paper marked with a red "Secret" character, the following words were clearly written: "Regarding the sales of stencil paper in the second quarter, we have determined after research: the Quzhou Stencil Paper Factory will supply Beijing with 760,000 sheets, and the Suichang Stencil Paper Factory will supply Dalian with 380,000 sheets. The above supply quantities should be met as much as possible with sub-grade and small-size paper (small-size paper is counted as one sheet per thousand), and if this is insufficient, it should be supplemented with regular-size paper, in order to ensure the quality and sales of stencil paper within the province. In addition to this, all production and the increased and surplus stencil paper from the first quarter will be supplied to the Hangzhou Xinhua Stencil Paper Factory. The above opinions should be kept confidential and not disclosed to the outside world. In the future, Beijing and Dalian will come to your factory to negotiate with an introduction letter from the Industrial Department, stating only the quantity, not the quality specifications, and your factory will independently control the supply." This is the instruction from the Zhejiang Provincial Industrial Department to the Quzhou and Suichang stencil paper factories regarding the supply of stencil paper—raw materials for wax paper. The meaning is not difficult to understand: keep the good stencil paper for ourselves, and supply the second-rate ones to other provinces, "in order to ensure the quality of stencil paper within the province," thereby giving Zhejiang's stencil paper a superior position in the domestic market.
　　Following the "do not disclose to the outside world" instruction, these two stencil paper factories very effectively implemented "secrecy." Comrades from Beijing and Dalian who came to order goods were finally deceived. Now, sub-grade and small-size paper have been included in the contract as agreed upon, "and there should be no regrets afterwards." It seems that forcing the comrades who ordered the goods to "have no regrets" is also impossible. I think the ordering units, after regretting, must draw a lesson, which is: "They should not have trusted so easily." 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Dong Shui

　　不可告人的“秘密”
    在一张纸角印着一个红“密”字的便笺上，清楚地写着这样一些话：“关于第二季度皮纸销售问题，经我们研究确定：衢州皮纸厂供应北京七十六万张，遂昌皮纸厂供应大连三十八万张。上述供应数量，尽量以副号及小开纸抵充供应（小开纸千张抵一张），如不足再以正号补足，以保证省内蜡纸的质量和销售。除此以外，全部产量及第一季度增产的和多余的皮纸，全部供应杭州新华蜡纸厂。以上意见应请保密，不得对外。以后北京和大连就凭工业厅介绍信前来你厂接洽，只说明数量，不说明质量规格，由你厂自行掌握供应。”这就是浙江省工业厅关于皮纸——蜡纸原料供应问题给衢州、遂昌二皮纸厂的指示。内中意思不难领会：把好皮纸留给自己，次等的供应外省，“以保证省内蜡纸的质量”，从而，使浙江的蜡纸在国内市场上居于优越地位。
    这两个皮纸厂遵照“不得对外”的指示，十分有效地实行了“保密”。北京、大连来订货的同志，终于被蒙混过去了。现在，副号及小开纸张已经如数订入合同，“嗣后不得后悔”。看来，硬要订货的同志“不得后悔”，也是行不通的，我想订货单位在后悔之余，一定要得出一条教训，这就是：“不该轻易信任”。        东水
