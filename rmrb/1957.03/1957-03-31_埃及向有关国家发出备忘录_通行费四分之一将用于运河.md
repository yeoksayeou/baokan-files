Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 30th: According to a report in "Al-Ahram" on the 29th, the Egyptian government, in a memorandum sent to countries related to the Suez Canal two days ago, stated that Egypt will allocate 25% of the canal tolls for the maintenance and expansion of the canal.

Egypt has sent a copy of this memorandum to the United Nations Secretariat.

The memorandum also stated:

    I. Canal tolls will not be increased.
    II. The Egyptian government will collect a 5% tax on the annual income of the Suez Canal Authority.
    III. Shareholders of the former Suez Canal Company will be compensated in accordance with the nationalization decree announced on July 26th of last year. If there are any disputes in this regard, Egypt will accept arbitration or submit the case to the International Court of Justice.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 30th: Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi met on the 29th with diplomatic envoys from China and six other countries stationed in Egypt, and handed them Egypt's memorandum on the management of the Suez Canal. These diplomatic envoys included those from Belgium, Greece, Lebanon, Spain, Tunisia, and Ethiopia.

Prior to this, Egypt had sent this memorandum to the diplomatic envoys of the Soviet Union, the United States, India, and other countries stationed in Egypt.

Xinhua News Agency, March 30th: On March 29th, the United States, Britain, and France issued separate official comments on Egypt's memorandum regarding the use of the Suez Canal.

White, a spokesman for the US State Department, said that the United States is studying the memorandum and will give a reply "in a few days." He said that the United States considers Egypt's proposal to be a "draft memorandum," which means that the memorandum is not necessarily a final position, but is put forward "for your consideration" and "to hear your opinions."

British officials expressed dissatisfaction with Egypt's memorandum and considered the negotiations between UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and the Egyptian government to be "disappointing." It is said that the British government is consulting with other relevant countries on this issue and is urging the United States to agree to the plan to build a new oil pipeline in Turkey.

A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said that the French government is studying Egypt's memorandum and will soon submit its opinions to other relevant countries, especially the United States, Britain, and Norway. The spokesman said that, like the British and American governments, France has warned its shipping companies not to use the Suez Canal. At the same time, France strongly supports the plan currently being studied to build oil pipelines across Turkey and Israel. The French government is prepared to provide assistance to this plan so that Western countries can ultimately "not depend" on the Suez Canal.

    埃及向有关国家发出备忘录
    通行费四分之一将用于运河
    新华社开罗30日电　据“金字塔报”29日报道，埃及政府在两天前送给同苏伊士运河有关各国的备忘录中说，埃及将从运河通行费中提出25％来保养和扩建运河。
    埃及已经把这个备忘录的副本送给联合国秘书处。
    备忘录中还说：
    一、运河通行费将不增加；
    二、埃及政府将从苏伊士运河当局每年的收入中征收5％的税。
    三、前苏伊士运河公司的股东，将根据去年7月26日宣布的国有化法令予以补偿，在这方面如果有任何争执的话，埃及将接受仲裁，或者把案件提交国际法院。
    新华社开罗30日电　埃及外交部长法齐在29日会见了中国和其他六个国家驻埃及的外交使节，把埃及关于管理苏伊士运河的备忘录交给他们。在这些外交使节中包括比利时、希腊、黎巴嫩、西班牙、突尼斯和埃塞俄比亚的使节。
    在这以前，埃及已经把这个备忘录送给苏联、美国、印度和其他国家驻埃及的外交使节。
    新华社30日讯　美、英、法三国官方3月29日分别就埃及关于使用苏伊士运河的备忘录发表了评论。
    美国国务院发言人怀特说，美国正在研究这个备忘录，并且将“在几天内”给予答复。他说，美国认为埃及的建议是“备忘录草案”，这就是说，备忘录不一定是最后的态度，而是提出来“供你考虑”和
  “听取你所要表示的意见”的东西。
    英国官方对埃及的备忘录表示不满，并且认为联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德同埃及政府的谈判是“令人失望”的。据说，英国政府正在就这个问题同其他有关国家磋商，并且正在催促美国同意在土耳其建立新油管的计划。
    法国外交部的一个发言人说，法国政府正在研究埃及的备忘录，并且不久将把它的意见送交其他有关国家，特别是美国、英国和挪威。发言人说，同英国和美国政府一样，法国已经警告它的轮船公司不要使用苏伊士运河。同时，法国十分赞同目前正在研究的关于修筑横贯土耳其和以色列的油管的计划。法国政府准备对这项计划给予援助，以便使西方国家最后能够“不依赖”苏伊士运河。
