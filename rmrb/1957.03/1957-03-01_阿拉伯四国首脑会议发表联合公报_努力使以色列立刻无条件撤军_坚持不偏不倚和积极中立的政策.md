Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 28th: The summit conference of the leaders of Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan concluded on the evening of the 27th. In a joint communiqué issued at 10 p.m. that day, the four leaders stated their intention to work towards the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israel to the armistice lines and announced that they would adhere to a "policy of impartiality and active neutrality."

The communiqué stated that the Arab leaders believe that "aggression still exists" due to Israel's failure to implement United Nations resolutions. The communiqué stated, "The inhabitants of the Gaza Strip continue to suffer the most despicable forms of persecution and oppression, which constitutes a threat to the security and peace of the Middle East."

The communiqué stated that the participants announced: "(1) To work for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israel to the armistice lines; (2) To fully safeguard the rights of the Palestinian Arabs and the Arab sovereignty over their territories and territorial waters; (3) The aggressor countries must compensate for all the losses suffered by Egypt as a result of their aggression; (4) To oppose all attempts to weaken Egypt's sovereignty and rights over the Suez Canal, because the Suez Canal is an indivisible part of Egypt, its sovereignty over the canal is absolute, and freedom of navigation in the canal is stipulated according to the terms of the 1888 Constantinople Convention; (5) Condemn the British aggression against Yemeni territory, and adopt an attitude of supporting Yemen to curb this aggression; (6) Absolutely support the rights of the Algerian Arabs to freedom and independence and their heroic struggle against imperialist forces."

The communiqué stated that the participants thanked the King of Saudi Arabia for his efforts to clarify the Arab views on the Middle East issue and other issues during his visit to the United States. The King of Saudi Arabia explained in detail the issues he explained to the President of the United States. The communiqué stated that the King of Saudi Arabia had explained to the President of the United States Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal, and at the same time pointed out to the latter the serious situation that could be caused by Israel's failure to comply with the United Nations resolutions on unconditional withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba. Saudi Arabia pointed out that Israel must not be allowed to gain any benefit from the tripartite aggression.

The communiqué stated: "The participants declare that their countries are eager to play their role internationally on the basis of contributing to peace, security, and prosperity, to extend their hand to cooperate with all countries, and to welcome the friendship expressed by countries wishing to be friendly with us on the basis of respect for sovereignty, interests, and the policies independently determined by our respective countries."

The communiqué also stated: The Arab countries "reaffirm their determination to protect the Arab world from the dangers of the Cold War, and that it will adhere to a policy of impartiality and active neutrality to safeguard its true interests. It also emphasizes the fact that the defense of the Arab world should be established by the Arab countries in accordance with the true security of the Arab countries and should be outside the scope of foreign conventions."

The joint communiqué was signed by Egyptian President Nasser, Syrian President Kuwatly, Saudi Arabian King Saud, and Jordanian King Hussein; in addition, the Syrian Prime Minister and the Jordanian Prime Minister were also present.

    阿拉伯四国首脑会议发表联合公报
    努力使以色列立刻无条件撤军
    坚持不偏不倚和积极中立的政策
    新华社开罗28日电  埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯和约旦四国首脑会议已经在27日晚间结束。四国领袖在当天晚间十时发表的联合公报中，表示将为以色列立即无条件地撤退到停战线后面而努力，并且宣布将坚持“不偏不倚和积极中立的政策”。
    公报说，阿拉伯领袖们认为，由于以色列不执行联合国的决议，“侵略仍然存在”。公报说，“加沙地带的居民仍然遭受着最卑劣的形式的迫害和压迫，这构成了对中东安全和和平的威胁。”
    公报说，参加会议者宣布：“（一）为以色列立刻无条件地撤退到停战线以后而努力；（二）充分维护巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯人的权利和阿拉伯人对他们领土和领水的主权；（三）侵略国家必须赔偿由于它们的侵略给埃及造成的一切损失；（四）反对一切想削弱埃及对苏伊士运河的主权和权利的尝试，因为苏伊士运河是埃及不可分割的一部分，它对运河的主权是绝对的，运河的航行自由是根据1888年君士坦丁堡公约的条款规定的；（五）谴责英国对也门领土发动的侵略，并且采取一种支援也门以遏制这种侵略的态度；（六）绝对支持阿尔及利亚的阿拉伯人自由和独立的权利和他们对帝国主义势力进行的英勇斗争。”
    公报说，与会者感谢沙特阿拉伯国王在访问美国期间努力阐明阿拉伯关于中东问题和其他问题的观点。沙特国王详细说明了他向美国总统解释的问题。公报说，沙特国王曾经向美国总统说明埃及对苏伊士运河的主权，同时向后者指出了由于以色列不遵守从加沙地带和亚喀巴湾无条件撤退的联合国决议而可能造成的严重局势，沙特指出，不得让以色列由于三国的侵略而取得任何利益。
    公报说：“与会者声明，他们的国家切望在有助于和平、安全和繁荣的基础上在国际范围内发挥它们的作用，伸出它们的手来同一切国家合作，并且欢迎希望同我们友好的国家在尊重主权、利益和我们各国自行规定的政策的基础上表示的友谊。”
    公报又说：阿拉伯国家“重申决心要保障阿拉伯世界使它不受到冷战的危害，而且它将坚持不偏不倚和积极中立的政策，以维护它的真正利益。它还强调指出这个事实：阿拉伯世界的防务应当按照阿拉伯国家的真正安全由阿拉伯国家建立并且应处于外国公约的范围之外”。
    阿拉伯四国首脑在27日晚上七时三十分举行了三天会议中的最后一次会议，接着就在库巴宫举行联合公报的签字仪式。在公报上签字的是埃及总统纳赛尔，叙利亚总统库阿特利，沙特阿拉伯国王沙特和约旦国王侯赛尼；此外，还有叙利亚总理和约旦首相。会谈参加者在举行签字仪式的时候相互祝贺。叙利亚总统库阿特利告诉记者说，为了阿拉伯人的利益，他希望在这次会谈以后将再举行会谈。
    据悉，美国驻埃及大使在联合公报签字以后立即访问了沙特国王。
