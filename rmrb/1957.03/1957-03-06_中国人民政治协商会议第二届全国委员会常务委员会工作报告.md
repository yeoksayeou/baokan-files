Chairman Chen Shutong, fellow members:

    I, on behalf of the Standing Committee, present this work report to the Third Session of the Second National Committee for your review.

    In the year since the Second Session of the Second National Committee adjourned, the Standing Committee has primarily undertaken the following tasks:
    (1)
    At its 18th meeting on March 5, 1956, the Standing Committee consulted on the "Draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme" proposed by the Chinese Language Reform Committee, organized group discussions, and invited committee members in Beijing, members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and responsible persons from the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Higher Education, the Academy of Sciences, and other units to participate. In addition, the committee notified local committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in various provinces, autonomous regions, and important cities to organize discussions.

    At its 19th meeting on March 14 and 15, 1956, the Standing Committee consulted on the handling of Japanese war criminals, war criminals of the Chiang Kai-shek group, and prisoners of war. The committee and various democratic parties also sent representatives to observe the trials of Japanese war criminals by the Special Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court.

    At its 21st meeting on April 27, 1956, the Standing Committee heard and discussed the report of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation on the "Situation of the National Conference of Family Members of Industrial and Commercial Business Owners and Female Industrial and Commercial Business Owners."

    At its 23rd meeting on May 10, 1956, the Standing Committee heard and discussed the report of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission on "Overseas Chinese Affairs Work in Socialist Construction and Socialist Transformation."

    At its 24th meeting on June 11, 1956, the Standing Committee consulted on the "Model Regulations (Draft) for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives."

    At its 26th meeting on July 11 and its 27th meeting on July 12, 1956, the Standing Committee consulted on the "Decision (Draft) on Lenient Treatment and Placement of Remaining Counter-Revolutionary Elements in Cities." Afterwards, it invited members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and responsible persons from various democratic parties to hold multiple seminars.

    At its 28th meeting on September 7, 1956, the Standing Committee heard and discussed the report of Committee Member Shi Liang on her visit to Czechoslovakia; the report of Committee Member Qian Duansheng on his visit to Canada; and the report of Committee Member Liu Wang Liming on her participation in the 20th Congress of the World Women's Christian Temperance Union.

    On September 20, 1956, Standing Committee members attended the 46th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, listened to Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the Suez Canal issue, and discussed the issue of supporting Egypt's resistance against aggression.

    At its 29th meeting on September 30, 1956, the Standing Committee heard and discussed the report of Committee Member Wang Yunsheng on his visit to Japan.

    On November 5, 1956, Standing Committee members attended the 50th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, listened to Premier Zhou Enlai's foreign policy report, and consulted on the Sino-Burmese border issue.

    At its 32nd meeting on December 26, 1956, the Standing Committee consulted on the "Regulations (Draft) for the 1957 National Economic Construction Bonds."

    At its 34th meeting on February 17, 1957, and its 36th meeting on February 23, 1957, the Standing Committee consulted on the issue of supplementing members of the committee, deciding to add nine members to fill vacancies and sixty-seven specially invited members.

    At its 35th enlarged meeting on February 19, 1957, the Standing Committee heard and discussed in groups the oral report of Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council on his visits to eleven countries: Vietnam, Cambodia, India, Burma, Pakistan, the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary, Afghanistan, Nepal, and Ceylon. Members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, members of the State Council, and responsible persons from other areas participated in this meeting.
    (2)
    November 12, 1956, marked the ninetieth anniversary of the birth of Sun Yat-sen, the great pioneer of China's democratic revolution. At its 30th meeting, the Standing Committee decided to hold commemorations in Beijing and various provinces, autonomous regions, and important cities; at the same time, it established the Preparatory Committee for the Ninetieth Anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's Birth, which, under the leadership of the Standing Committee, carried out preparatory work, including publishing a selection of Sun Yat-sen's works, producing commemorative badges, holding an exhibition of Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary achievements, publishing commemorative articles, and producing a commemorative film. On November 11, a commemorative meeting was held in Beijing, attended by more than 1,600 people, including more than 160 foreign guests from 31 countries and more than 40 overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao; a central delegation was organized to visit the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing; and representatives from various circles in Beijing were organized to visit the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in the Temple of Azure Clouds.
    (3)
    In order to enhance ties with overseas Chinese and various ethnic minority groups within the country, the committee hosted a total of 3,100 people from ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao who came to Beijing to observe the May Day and National Day celebrations in 1956.
    (4)
    During this period, the committee's international activities also increased. During the visits of Indonesian President Sukarno and Burmese Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League Chairman U Nu to China, the Standing Committee held welcoming receptions and invited them to deliver speeches.

    In 1956, the Standing Committee received a total of 298 foreign guests from 25 countries, including Vietnam, Japan, India, Ceylon, Pakistan, Indonesia, Syria, East Germany, Poland, Hungary, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Australia, and Sudan, and held 30 seminars with them. Through these activities, the foreign guests gained a greater understanding of China's people's democratic united front policy and activities, particularly the actual situation of the various democratic parties. At the same time, we further strengthened our work in uniting international friends.
    (5)
    The Standing Committee held its 22nd and 31st meetings jointly with the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on May 8 and November 16, 1956, and decided on the inspection work for the summer and winter of 1956. The issues and opinions raised by the members during the summer inspection of 1956, which were related to the work of state organs, were forwarded to the relevant competent authorities at the central and local levels for research and handling; those related to the work of local committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference were studied and handled separately by the committee. After the winter inspection of 1956, the committee and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress jointly organized fourteen specialized problem groups to fully discuss the issues and opinions raised during the inspection, and have compiled and printed abstracts of the materials reflected in the symposiums of the fourteen groups as a special booklet for reference when discussing issues at this meeting.
    (6)
    In order to meet the demands of democratic figures and industrialists and business owners from all walks of life for political and theoretical study, the Standing Committee passed the "Decision on Organizing Political and Theoretical Study for Democratic Figures and Industrialists and Business Owners from All Walks of Life" at its 20th meeting on March 27, 1956; and established a Study Committee to assist the Standing Committee in guiding the study work of local committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in various regions. Over the past year, local committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in various provinces, autonomous regions, and large and medium-sized cities have generally planned their study work, and have held study seminars, study lectures, amateur political schools, short-term political schools, and short-term training courses for industrialists and business owners, absorbing democratic figures and industrialists and business owners from all walks of life to participate in study on a voluntary basis, forming a surge of study. The committee also issued "Several Explanations on the Teaching Principles Related to the Study of Democratic Figures and Industrialists and Business Owners from All Walks of Life" last October, guiding various regions to correctly implement the teaching principles and improve teaching methods.

    The Standing Committee also decided to establish the Socialist Academy. The Socialist Academy opened in October 1956. The first class had one hundred and sixty-one students. The courses studied were dialectical materialism and historical materialism, political economics, the history of the Chinese revolution, and current affairs policies. The teaching results were good. In addition, the study seminars and amateur political schools held by the committee have continued as usual over the past year and have achieved results.

    Finally, I will submit to the congress the "Summary Report on the Work of Short-Term Training Courses for Industrialists and Business Owners" approved by the Standing Committee, which is prepared by the Study Committee of the committee, as an attachment to this report.
    (7)
    The committee originally had eight working groups, and the Standing Committee decided to add three more working groups—Medical and Health, Ethnic Affairs, and Women's Affairs—at its 20th meeting on March 27, 1956. Over the past year, the working groups have held a total of 68 seminars and 10 report meetings, and have also organized visits and other activities. The content of the research and seminars of each group mainly included the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, the situation in the Middle East and the Egyptian issue, the nature of the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in China during the transition period, the situation and problems in music, drama, and fine arts, the issues of teaching quality, scientific research, and teaching work, the issues of returned overseas Chinese intellectuals, the situation of religious circles in various regions, the issue of rural medical and health care, and the situation of female students studying abroad and the families of students studying abroad after returning to China. The report meetings held by each group mainly included Sino-Indian cultural exchanges, China's international scientific activities, the situation of visits to five Asian and African countries, and the situation of work and welfare of the blind in the Soviet Union. The issues and opinions raised at the meetings of each group have been successively submitted to the relevant competent departments for handling.

    After the Second Session of the Committee, the Standing Committee established two temporary working groups: the Intellectuals' Issues Research Group and the Local Committees of the Political Consultative Conference's Work Issues Research Group. The committee earnestly studied the relevant issues and opinions raised during the winter inspection of 1955 and at the Second Session, and handled them accordingly.
    (8)
    During this period, 332 more local committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference were established throughout the country. Including those established previously, there are now a total of 690 local committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

    Over the past year, the work of local committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has generally been strengthened compared to the past, and the work of some places is more active, but in some places, the work of local committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is still not valued, and in many places, the work of local committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is not substantial enough, with few daily activities, and some local committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference still lack cadres, premises, and funding. These are all urgently in need of improvement.

    In order to strengthen the ties between the committee and local committees and to strengthen guidance for their work, the Standing Committee decided to establish a "Local Work Committee" at its 33rd meeting. The main task of this committee is to assist the Standing Committee in handling issues related to the work of local committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, strengthen investigation and research, provide opinions for improving work, and promote and exchange work experience.
    (9)
    The Standing Committee passed the "Decision on Improving the Editorial Work of the Committee's Journal" at its 32nd meeting on December 26, 1956, and reorganized the Editorial Committee of the journal. According to this decision, the task of the committee's journal is to report on the activities of the committee and local committees, as well as various democratic parties and people's organizations, exchange work experience, reflect the issues and opinions of all aspects of the united front, and carry out free debate, in order to help consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front.

    Fellow members, the above is the main work of the committee since the Second Session. Over the past year, the work of the Standing Committee has been relatively substantial. This is inseparable from the relatively systematic review of work last year and from the efforts of various working departments, but we cannot be satisfied with the existing achievements. In the future, we should continue to work hard, consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front, expand democratic life, and, in the international arena, strengthen the friendship between the Chinese people and the peace-loving people of the world, based on the principle of defending world peace, and according to the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision."

    中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告	陈叔通主席、各位委员：
    我代表常务委员会向本届全国委员会第三次全体会议提出工作报告，请予以审查。

    常务委员会在1956年7月11日第二十六次和7月12日第二十七次会议上就“关于宽大处理和安置城市残余反革命分子的决定（草案）”进行了协商。会后，又邀请全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员和各民主党派负责人员举行多次座谈。

    常务委员会在1957年2月17日第三十四次会议和2月23日第三十六次会议上就增补本会委员的问题进行了协商，决定了补缺委员九人，增加特邀委员六十七人。
    常务委员会在1957年2月19日第三十五次扩大的会议上听取和分组讨论了国务院总理周恩来访问越南、柬埔寨、印度、缅甸、巴基斯坦、苏联、波兰、匈牙利、阿富汗、尼泊尔、锡兰等十一国家的口头报告。参加这次会议的有全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员、国务院组成人员和其他各方面的负责人员。	（二）
    1956年11月12日是我国伟大的民主革命先行者孙中山诞辰九十周年。常务委员会在第三十次会议上决定在北京和全国各省、自治区和重要城市举行纪念；同时成立了孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念筹备委员会，在常务委员会领导下进行筹备工作，出版了孙中山选集，制发纪念章，举办孙中山革命事迹展览会，发表纪念文章和摄制纪念影片等。11月11日在北京举行了纪念大会，参加者共一千六百余人，其中有来自三十一个国家的外宾一百六十余人，国外华侨和港澳同胞四十余人；组织了中央谒陵代表团赴南京参谒中山陵；在北京组织了各界代表人士参谒碧云寺孙中山纪念堂。	（三）
    为了增强对国外华侨和国内各兄弟民族之间的联系，在1956年五一节和国庆节，本会曾经招待了来北京观礼的兄弟民族、华侨和港澳同胞共计三千一百余人。	（四）
    在这一时期内，本会的国际活动也增加了。常务委员会在印度尼西亚共和国总统苏加诺和缅甸联邦反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努来我国访问的期间，曾经先后举行欢迎会，邀请他们发表演说。
    常务委员会在1956年内共接待了越南、日本、印度、锡兰、巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚、叙利亚、民主德国、波兰、匈牙利、英国、法国、意大利、比利时、丹麦、挪威、芬兰、加拿大、墨西哥、阿根廷、巴西、智利、秘鲁、澳大利亚、苏丹等二十五个国家来华访问的外宾二百九十八人，同他们分别举行座谈会三十次。通过这些活动，外宾们对于我国人民民主统一战线的政策和活动，特别对于各民主党派的实际情况有了更多的了解，同时，我们也进一步加强了团结国际友人的工作。	（五）
    常务委员会在1956年5月8日和11月16日举行的第二十二次和第三十一次会议，与全国人民代表大会常务委员会联合举行，决定了1956年夏季和冬季的视察工作。1956年夏季视察工作中委员们所提出的问题和意见，凡是属于国家机关工作方面的，都转交中央和地方的各有关主管机关研究处理；属于政治协商会议地方委员会工作方面的，已经由本会分别作了研究和处理。1956年冬季视察完毕后，本会与全国人民代表大会常务委员会共同组织了十四个专门问题小组，对于视察中所提出的问题和意见，进行了充分的讨论，并且已将十四个小组在座谈会中反映出来的材料摘要编印专册，供这次会议讨论问题时的参考。	（六）
    为了适应全国各界民主人士和工商业者对政治学习和理论学习的要求，常务委员会在1956年3月27日第二十次会议上通过了“关于组织各界民主人士和工商业者进行政治学习和理论学习的决定”；并且成立了学习委员会，协助常务委员会指导各地政治协商会议地方委员会关于学习的工作。一年来各省、自治区和大中城市的政治协商会议地方委员会对学习工作普遍进行了规划，分别举办了学习座谈会、学习讲座、业余政治学校、短期政治学校、工商业者短期讲习班等，吸收各界民主人士和工商业者在自愿的基础上参加学习，形成了学习热潮。本会又于去年10月发出了“对各界民主人士和工商业者学习中有关教学方针的几点说明”，指导各地正确执行教学方针和改进教学方法。
    常务委员会并决定了创办社会主义学院。社会主义学院于1956年10月开学。第一期学员一百六十一人。学习的课程是辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义、政治经济学、中国革命史和时事政策。教学成绩是良好的。此外本会举办的学习座谈会和业余政治学校一年来都照常进行，都有成绩。
    末了，我将向大会提出由常务委员会批准的本会学习委员会“关于工商业者短期讲习班工作的总结报告”，作为本报告的附件。	（七）
    本会原设有八个工作组，常务委员会在1956年3月27日第二十次会议上又决定增设医药卫生、民族、妇女三个工作组。一年来，各工作组共举行了座谈会六十八次，报告会十次，还组织了参观、访问等活动。各组研究和座谈的内容，主要有裁军和禁止原子武器的问题，中近东局势和埃及问题，我国过渡时期无产阶级与资产阶级矛盾性质的问题，关于音乐、戏剧、美术各方面的情况和问题，关于教学质量、科学研究和教学工作方面的问题，关于归国华侨知识分子方面的问题，各地宗教界的情况和问题，农村医疗卫生的问题，女留学生及留学生家属回国后的情况等。各组举行的报告会，主要有中印文化交流，我国在国际方面的科学活动，访问亚非五国的情况以及关于苏联盲人工作和生活福利的情况等。各组会议上提出的一些问题和意见，本会都先后送交各有关主管部门处理。
    在本会第二次全体会议之后，常务委员会成立了知识分子问题研究和政治协商会议地方委员会工作问题研究两个临时工作组。对于1955年冬季视察中和第二次全体会议上所提出的有关这两方面的问题和意见，认真进行了研究，并分别作了处理。	（八）
    在这时期内，全国各地又增设了三百三十二个政治协商会议地方委员会。连以前设立的，共有六百九十个政治协商会议地方委员会。
    这一年来，政治协商会议地方委员会的工作一般都较前加强，有的地方还比较活跃，但是有些地方，政治协商会议地方委员会的工作还有不被重视的情况，也有不少地方政治协商会议地方委员会的工作不够充实，日常活动不多，某些政治协商会议地方委员会的干部、房屋、经费都还缺乏。这些都是亟应加以改进的。
    为了密切本会与地方委员会的联系，加强对它们工作的指导，常务委员会在第三十三次会议上决定设立“地方工作委员会”。这个委员会的主要任务是协助常务委员会处理有关政治协商会议地方委员会工作的问题，加强调查研究，提供改进工作的意见，推广与交流工作经验。	（九）
    常务委员会在1956年12月26日第三十二次会议上通过了“关于改进本会会刊编辑工作的决定”，改组了会刊编辑委员会。根据这一决定，本会会刊的任务是报道本会和地方委员会以及各民主党派、人民团体的活动情况，交流工作经验，反映统一战线各方面的问题和意见，开展自由争论，以有助于人民民主统一战线的巩固和扩大。
    各位委员，上面就是本会第二次全体会议以来的主要工作。这一年来，常务委员会的工作是比较充实了。这是同去年比较有系统地检查工作分不开的，是同各工作部门的努力分不开的，但是我们不能满足既有的成绩，今后应根据“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，继续努力，巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，扩大民主生活，并且在国际方面，根据保卫世界和平的方针，加强中国人民同全世界爱好和平的人民的友谊。
