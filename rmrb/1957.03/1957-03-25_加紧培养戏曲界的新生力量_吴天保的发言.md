　　Intensify the Training of New Talent in the Opera World
　　Wu Tianbao's Speech
    I was deeply educated by Chairman Mao's report at the Supreme State Conference. I support the various reports at this CPPCC meeting.

    I am an opera worker, and I would like to talk about issues in the opera field. In the old society, performing opera was a lowly occupation, looked down upon. Many people sang opera their whole lives, only to die in poverty. Some were forced to change careers, and the opera art declined day by day. In the years since liberation, the political status of artists has improved. Especially after the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" was put forward, the opera world has flourished. Many opera genres have been promoted and developed, and some forgotten genres have been revived and grown. To make our work even better, I would like to talk about a serious phenomenon that is common in the opera world today: the number of excellent talents cultivated in the opera world in the years since liberation is too small. This is not just a problem in a particular province or city, or in a particular opera genre, but a widespread problem. Therefore, how to strengthen the training of new forces, cultivate outstanding artistic talents, and enrich the literary and artistic ranks has become an important issue for our opera world.

    In recent years, in the opera world, there have been very few outstanding young talents. Before liberation, under such difficult conditions, excellent talents continued to emerge. Now, under the extremely favorable conditions of the new society, we should be doing better. However, our work, especially the work of cultivating the next generation, is not satisfactory. There are many reasons for this. As far as I know, there are two main reasons: one is that the teaching is not good, and there are not many ways to train talents. Before liberation, there were many opera schools. Although there are now professional schools and training classes to train new forces, they are still not as numerous as the old opera schools. According to my personal experience, the methods of absorbing amateur performers and private tutoring have gradually disappeared because of the poor economic conditions under the reactionary rule before liberation, especially during the Anti-Japanese War when artists were even more difficult. Generally, they could only maintain their lives, and very few people took private apprentices. However, even though there were few, they could still cultivate some excellent talents. After liberation, private tutoring was no longer adopted. In this method of private tutoring, during the teaching period, apprentices feared nothing more than not being loved by their masters, and they respected their masters extremely. They were willing to endure beatings and scoldings just to learn the skills. Therefore, they had a deep understanding of the difficulty of learning the art, and they studied and practiced extremely hard. Although this system is not suitable for promotion now, the apprentice's respect for the master allows the master to impart his skills to the best of his ability, and thus talents can be cultivated. Undeniably, this system has its merits.

    Now, the old methods have been abandoned, but the teachers have not yet mastered the new methods. In the education process, they are not good at patiently persuading. Therefore, although they have the heart of "hoping that iron will turn into steel," they feel helpless and depressed because they have no way to teach. Students, on the other hand, have high demands, but they cannot study hard and practice diligently. If the teacher's attitude is slightly stricter, they are dissatisfied, and even criticize and struggle against the teacher in mass movements. Establishing respect for teachers and love for students and strengthening education for students.

    How can this not become an obstacle to our cultivation of excellent talents? If this continues, it will become a crisis in our opera world. In order to eliminate this obstacle, change the current defects in the work of cultivating talents, and create favorable conditions for cultivating excellent talents, I think we must formulate a rational system of respecting teachers and loving students, and in addition to the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League strengthening education for students, we will surely achieve great results in cultivating talents.

    As for how to formulate the master-apprentice system, I will only briefly mention it. If teachers can cultivate excellent talents, the state should give them spiritual or material rewards to encourage private tutoring. On the other hand, it is also necessary to stipulate that students should give teachers a certain amount of remuneration. This remuneration should not be regarded as the master's exploitation of the apprentice, but should be regarded as the labor remuneration that the master deserves after teaching the apprentice.

    Therefore, the purpose of establishing this system is to enable students to correctly understand the career they are engaged in, to study diligently, practice hard, and humbly accept the teacher's guidance. At the same time, this is also to enable teachers to correctly understand the importance of cultivating the younger generation for the country, establish a high sense of responsibility to the country, the people, the students, and the parents, thereby patiently educating the students, treating the students as their own children, and imparting all their skills to them.

    If the system of respecting teachers and loving students can be established and implemented effectively, I think it can be applied not only to the opera world, but also to all aspects, because all aspects need to cultivate excellent talents. Please consider the above opinions. Develop amateur cultural activities to discover talents.

    The second reason is the source of training objects. In addition to the fact that few excellent talents are produced due to poor teaching and not many methods, there is also the problem of the students' own conditions. When selecting training objects, we must first consider three basic conditions: first, appearance and figure, which are physiological conditions; second, innate conditions, requiring actors not only to have a voice, but also to have a good voice; third, innate intelligence, that is, a strong ability to accept. These conditions are the most basic requirements for a student to be potentially cultivated into an actor and an excellent talent. Students who fully possess the above conditions are indeed rare. Naturally, to become an excellent talent, students also need to study hard and practice diligently, and teachers need to teach patiently. However, even if the students study very hard and practice diligently, and the teachers teach very well, if the students are insufficient in innate conditions, it is still impossible to cultivate excellent talents. I think that under the current economic conditions in our country, it is not possible to run more schools and training classes, and it is difficult to find training objects. This problem is not easy to solve for a while, but I think there is another direction we can take, which is to develop amateur cultural activities to discover talents. As far as I know, there are many kinds of amateur artistic talents, including opera, music, singing, and playing instruments. These talents are scattered in various work posts and are a new force in literature and art that we need to discover and strive for. These comrades all have certain artistic expertise and foundation, and they love literature and art very much. I think that if these comrades do not have much prospect of development in their original work posts, it is better to let them participate in the literary and artistic ranks and give play to their expertise and hobbies. This is beneficial to both sides. In addition to our literary and artistic workers taking the initiative to discover and strive for talents in amateur cultural activities, I hope that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and other groups and relevant parties will strongly support and call for this so that our literary and artistic ranks can be enriched and strengthened, and that we can cultivate more excellent literary and artistic workers from these new forces to better serve the socialist construction of the motherland.

### 加紧培养戏曲界的新生力量　吴天保的发言

　　加紧培养戏曲界的新生力量
　　吴天保的发言
    我在最高国务会议上听了毛主席报告，受到很深的教育。我拥护这次政协会议上的各种报告。
    我是一个戏曲工作者，我想谈谈戏曲方面的问题。旧社会唱戏是下贱的事，被人轻视，很多人唱一辈子戏，最后贫困而死，有的不得已改了行，戏剧事业日益衰退。解放这几年，艺人政治地位提高了，尤其在百家争鸣百花齐放方针提出后，戏剧界繁荣了，很多戏种被发扬光大，有的被人遗忘的剧种，也复活了，生长起来了。为了把我们的事业搞得更好，我想谈一谈目前在戏曲界普遍存在的一个严重现象，就是我们戏曲界解放后几年来培养出来的优秀人材太少了。这不只是某一个省市或是某一个剧种存在问题，而是普遍性的问题。所以如何加强培养新生力量，造就优秀的艺术人材、充实文艺队伍，就成为我们戏曲界的一个重要问题。
    最近几年戏曲界，青年一代中后起之秀极为少见，解放以前在那样艰苦条件下接续出现优秀人材，而今新社会条件极为优越之情况下，本应做得更好，但是我们工作，尤其培养下代的工作，不能令人满意。究其原因则甚多，就我所认识主要原因有两个方面：其一是由于教学不善，培养人材的方式不多：解放以前设有很多科班，现今虽设有专业学校、训练班，培养新生力量，仍不如已往科班多，据我个人经验吸收票友和私人带徒弟的方法，由于解放前在反动统治下，经济条件很差，致使票友下海逐渐绝迹，尤其在抗日时期艺人更为困难，一般仅能维持生活，很少有私人带徒弟，但是虽然少却还能培养出一些优秀人材，到了解放以后私人带徒弟已经不再采用。这种私人带徒弟的方法，在教学时期，艺徒唯恐不得师傅的爱抚，极其尊重师傅，宁愿忍受打骂只求学得技艺，因而对学艺之艰难深有体会，极其勤学苦练，这种制度，现在虽不宜提倡，但徒弟之对于师傅的尊重而使师傅尽其所能传授技艺，因此人材得以造就。不容辩解，此种制度，自有其可取之处。
    现今旧方法已弃之不用，而师傅尚未掌握新的方法，教育过程中不善耐心说服，因此虽有“恨铁不成钢”之心，而因教学无方感到无奈与苦闷。学生方面则要求甚高，但不能艰苦学习努力锻炼，老师态度稍加严厉，就不满意，甚而在群众运动中借故批评斗争师傅。树立尊师爱徒思想，加强对学生的教育
    这种情况，岂能不成为我们培养优秀人材之障碍？长此以往实将成为我们戏曲界之危机，为扫除这种障碍改变目前培养人材工作中之缺陷，为培养出优秀人材创造有利条件，我以为必须拟订一种尊师爱徒，合情合理的制度，再加上党政工团加强对学生们的教育外，在培养人材方面必能获得很大的成效。
    至于师徒制度如何订法，我仅概略地提一下，若老师能培养出优秀人材的，国家应该给予精神上或物质上的奖励，以鼓舞私人带徒弟。另一方面还有必要规定，学生应该给老师一定的报酬，这种报酬不能看作是师傅对徒弟的剥削，而应该看作是由于师傅教徒弟付出了一定的劳动后应得的劳动报酬。
    所以要订这种制度，目的在于使学生正确认识自己从事的事业和刻苦钻研、勤学苦练，虚心接受师傅的教导。同时，这对于师傅也是通过建立这种制度，使其正确认识为国家培养青年一代的重要性，树立对国家对人民、对学生及家长的高度责任感，从而耐心教育学生，将学生视同自己的子女一样，把自己的全部技艺传授给他们。
    尊师爱徒制度，若能建立起来，而行之有效的话，我认为不只是限于戏曲界能应用，而各方面都能采用，因为无论那一方面也都需要培养优秀的人材。上述意见请各位委员考虑。开展业余文艺活动，以便发掘人材
    第二个原因是培养对象的来源问题，除了上面所谈到的优秀人材出得少，是由于教学不善，采用方式不多之外，还有一个原因是学生本身的条件问题，物色培养对象，首先要考虑三个基本条件，第一是相貌、身材，这是生理条件。第二是先天的条件，要求演员不仅要有嗓音，而且有好嗓音。第三是天赋的智力，就是接受的能力要强。这些条件是一个可能培养成为演员和优秀人材的最基本的要求，全部具备上述条件的学生确是不可多得的。自然要成为优秀的人材还需学生本身的勤学苦练，和师傅耐心教导。但即使学生非常钻研，勤学苦练，师傅也教得很好，而学生在先天的条件上不足，则要培养出优秀的人材来还是不可能的。我想在我们国家目前的经济状况下，还不可能办更多的学校和训练班，而且物色培养对象有困难，这个问题，一时是不易解决的，但我认为另有一个方向可以走，就是开展业余文艺活动，从而发掘人材。据我所知，业余艺术人材，多种多样，戏曲、音乐、歌唱、演奏等等无所不有。而这些人材都分散在各种工作岗位上，是一支需要我们去发现和争取的文艺新生力量。这些同志都具有一定文艺专长和基础，而且酷爱文艺。我以为，这些同志如果在原来的工作岗位上发展前途不大，不如让他参加到文艺队伍里来，发挥他的专长和爱好，这样做是两方面都有利的。对于业余文艺活动中的人材，除了我们文艺工作者主动去发现、争取外，希望总工会及其他团体组织和有关方面，大力支持，加以号召，使我们的文艺队伍得到充实和壮大，使我们从这些新生力量中培养出更多的优秀文艺工作者，来更好地为祖国社会主义建设服务。（附图片）
