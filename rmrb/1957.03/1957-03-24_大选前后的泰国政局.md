The general election in Thailand has ended in a tense atmosphere. Before and after this election, imperialists carried out many conspiracies, attempting to further tie Thailand to the American chariot. However, the facts show that the trend of Thailand demanding an independent policy is growing. This is the result of the development of the Thai political situation in recent years.

The coup group headed by Luang Phibunsongkhram has been the ruling party in Thailand since 1947. In 1955, Luang Phibunsongkhram also established the Seri Manangkhasila Party. During this period, American imperialist aggressive forces extended into Thailand on a large scale under the guise of "aid." The Luang Phibunsongkhram government successively signed the "US-Thailand Economic and Technical Assistance Agreement" and the "US-Thailand Military Assistance Agreement" with the United States in 1950. Since Thailand participated in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization manufactured by the United States, the Thai government has implemented a policy of expanding armaments, preparing for war, and "embargo." All this has brought great disasters to Thailand.

As a result of accepting "US aid" and implementing the "embargo," Thailand's foreign trade deteriorated sharply, and the export volume of important products decreased significantly. Since 1950, Thailand's rice exports have decreased by more than 25%, timber exports have decreased by 30%, and tobacco has decreased by 50%. Since 1952, Thailand's foreign trade deficit has increased year by year. In the first half of 1956 alone, the trade deficit reached 455 million baht. This cannot but seriously hit Thailand's national economy. It is estimated that 75% of the textile factories, 40% of the tin mines, and more than 90% of the tungsten mines in the country have closed down, and other factories such as rubber, papermaking, and rice milling have also been forced to reduce production. Imperialists plunder a large amount of cheap raw materials from Thailand every year, while dumping surplus products into Thailand continuously. Not only that, Americans can also invest in any industrial sector in Thailand and freely remit the profits they extract abroad.

Because Thailand accepted "US aid" and joined the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the United States can occupy Thai military bases at any time and force the Thai government to expand its armaments. In 1955 alone, Thailand's military expenditure exceeded more than twice the "US aid" it had received in the past four years (approximately 30 million US dollars), accounting for more than 65% of Thailand's budget expenditure. This has made Thailand's financial payments even more difficult, and the budget deficit in 1956 reached 1,159.9 million baht, accounting for 19.6% of the total budget expenditure. These huge military expenditures have to be added to the heads of the working people, the number of unemployed people continues to increase, prices are soaring, and the living conditions of the people are deteriorating. According to materials published by the Thai Ministry of Economy, the cost of living in Thailand has increased by more than 50% in the past few years, and rents have risen by 266%. Since 1950, the Thai government has increased taxes levied on farmers alone by nine times. According to a report in the Thai "Economic Communications" bi-monthly, in order to accept "US aid," each person in Thailand must pay an average burden of about 20 baht per year. The "Bangkok Forum" also pointed out that due to the conditions attached to "US aid," "18 million Thai people have been placed under the restraint of unlimited obligations."

With the development of the trend of peace and neutrality in Asia, the Thai people have increasingly realized that following the American war policy is incompatible with their own national interests. On February 20 this year, at the inaugural meeting of the Thai Labor Federation and its 27 affiliated trade unions in different industries, workers held up slogans expressing their wishes, which read "Implement a neutral policy and withdraw from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization," "Conduct free trade," "Support the principle of peaceful coexistence," and "Abolish anti-communist regulations." These just calls reflect the demands and interests of all the Thai people. More and more people are demanding that the Thai government implement an independent foreign policy and get rid of American control.

Due to the strengthening of popular pressure, and also due to the increasing conflict of interest between the American colonial aggression policy and the Thai ruling class, the Luang Phibunsongkhram government has gradually changed some of its practices in recent years. In September 1955, the Thai people were allowed to resume political party activities. In June last year, after Britain, Indonesia, Malaysia and other countries announced the abolition of the rubber "embargo," the Thai government finally accepted the demands of the people and made a decision to allow merchants to directly trade with China and to export non-strategic materials such as rice, timber, and tin to peaceful and democratic countries. On January 10 this year, Thai Finance Minister Phra Pridi Phanomyong reiterated to the press that, apart from strategic materials, Thai merchants have the right to conduct free trade with all countries. The Thai authorities will not prevent the export of non-strategic materials to China at all. He also admitted that Thailand's sale of surplus tobacco leaves to China "is obtaining very superior and satisfactory prices." Recently, Prime Minister Luang Phibunsongkhram also expressed "willingness to consider" the people's demands for implementing an independent foreign policy and abolishing "anti-communist regulations"; and said that if he serves as prime minister in the next government, he "will submit the above-mentioned requirements to the parliament for discussion." On the eve of this general election, the Seri Manangkhasila Party also revised some domestic and foreign policies, such as formulating labor laws, stipulating workers' working hours, and allowing workers limited rights to assembly and strike, and passing a resolution on "amnesty for political prisoners." These are all noteworthy new factors in the development of the Thai political situation.

The measures taken by the Luang Phibunsongkhram government that are in line with the national interest, coupled with other conditions, enabled the Seri Manangkhasila Party to win the majority of votes in this general election and maintain its status as the ruling party. However, after all, these changes are far from meeting the demands of the people, so the votes it received in this election were greatly reduced compared with the last general election. According to the final results of the parliamentary election announced by the Thai government, the Seri Manangkhasila Party, which nominated more than 200 candidates in this election, only won 82 seats out of the 160 first-category members of parliament; while in the previous parliament, the party occupied 100 seats out of the 123 first-category members, accounting for about 83% of the total number of members of parliament. On the other hand, the votes of almost all major opposition parties (whether left-wing or right-wing) have increased. The number of seats in parliament occupied by the Democratic Party, headed by Nai Kuang Abhaiwongse's group, increased from six in the past to twenty-eight. The "Socialist United Front," which emerged as a new force in this general election, has an advantage in the elections in the northeastern provinces of Thailand. The number of seats in parliament occupied by the Economist Party (a member of the Socialist United Front) increased from three in the past to eight, and one of its leaders, Nai Chote Phuthiphong, became the candidate with the most votes in this Thai parliamentary election.

In order to more firmly control Thailand, the American imperialists secretly supported the main right-wing opposition parties in this election, attempting to contain the ruling Seri Manangkhasila Party, and at the same time stirred up trouble, attempting to threaten the current government. Under this circumstance, the Thai government declared a state of emergency nationwide on March 2. According to reports, during the state of emergency, the United States Information Service openly distributed a large number of propaganda materials to young students and the masses who were demonstrating, inciting them to oppose the Luang Phibunsongkhram government. This blatant interference by the United States aroused the indignation of the Thai people, and Thai officials also questioned the US Ambassador Bishop, asking him to explain why he was "distributing USIS leaflets" to the masses. In order to cover up the truth of these conspiracies, the imperialists spread rumors about what "communists" were provoking the incident. But this kind of lie cannot stand scrutiny. According to a report by Agence France-Presse on March 6, Thai Acting Foreign Minister Nai Rak Panyaarachun sternly refuted the foreign rumors that the March 2 "turmoil" was incited by communists at a press conference. Thai Marshal Sarit Thanarat also revealed that the riots were instigated by a country that has diplomatic relations with Thailand, but "based on diplomatic courtesy and fear of affecting relations between the two countries, it cannot be announced at the present time." However, some other situations revealed by some Thai newspapers have proved that the instigator of this incident was the United States.

At the same time, US Ambassador Bishop hurriedly rushed to Canberra to attend the Ministerial Council meeting of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. There are reports that the United States also wants to use the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to interfere in Thailand. Therefore, Thai Acting Foreign Minister Nai Rak Panyaarachun solemnly stated that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization has "no right" to interfere in Thailand's internal affairs.

These activities of the American ruling group in Thailand fully illustrate the true face of the American policy of aggression. The United States says time and again that it wants to help the countries of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization "prevent subversive activities," but in fact it is the United States itself that is subverting these countries. In the eyes of the United States, as long as it finds that the government of a certain country has the possibility of disagreeing with the United States, it can try to overthrow it, even if it is a country that has joined the American military bloc. Moreover, in the eyes of the United States, in these countries that have joined the American military bloc, the United States seems to be able to arbitrarily manipulate their destiny. The Thai people can draw a clearer conclusion from these facts: to safeguard their own national interests, they must get rid of American control and implement an independent and autonomous policy.

    大选前后的泰国政局
    舒云
    泰国的大选在紧张的气氛中结束了。在这次大选前后，帝国主义者进行了许多阴谋活动，企图把泰国更进一步缚在美国的战车上，然而事实却表明了泰国要求执行独立政策的趋势正在增长。这是几年来泰国政局发展的结果。
    以銮披汶为首的变政团自1947年以来就是泰国的执政党。1955年，銮披汶又建立了玛兰卡西拉自由党。在这期间，美帝国主义侵略势力以“援助”为名义大规模地伸入泰国。銮披汶政府于1950年先后和美国签订了“美泰经济技术援助协定”和“美泰军事援助协定”。自泰国参加了美国制造的东南亚条约组织以后，泰国政府执行了扩军备战和“禁运”政策。这一切给泰国带来了极大的灾难。
    由于接受“美援”和执行“禁运”的结果，泰国的对外贸易急趋恶化，重要物产的输出额大大地减少了。自1950年以后，泰国的大米输出减少了25％以上，木材输出减少了30％，烟草减少了50％。1952年以来，泰国对外贸易的赤字逐年增加。仅在1956年上半年贸易逆差已达四亿五千五百万铢。这不能不使泰国的国民经济受到严重的打击。据估计，全国75％的纺织厂、40％的锡矿场和90％以上的钨矿场已经倒闭，其他如橡胶、造纸、碾米等工厂也被迫减产。帝国主义者每年从泰国掠夺着大量的廉价原料，而把剩余产品源源不断地倾销到泰国。不仅如此，美国人还可以在泰国的任何一个工业部门进行投资，并可以把他们榨取的利润自由地汇到国外。
    由于泰国接受了“美援”并加入了东南亚条约组织，美国就可以随时占用泰国的军事基地，并迫使泰国政府扩充军备。仅在1955年一年内，泰国的军费开支超过了过去四年内所获“美援”（约三千万美元）的一倍以上，占泰国预算支出的65％以上。这就使得泰国的财政支付更加困难，1956年的预算赤字已达十一亿五千九百多万铢，占预算总支出的19．6％。这些庞大的军费开支不得不加到劳动人民的头上，失业人数不断增加，物价飞涨，人民的生活条件日趋恶化。据泰国经济部所发表的材料，泰国的生活费用在过去几年内提高了50％以上，而房租已上涨了266％。自1950年以来，泰国政府仅向农民征收的赋税就增加了九倍。另据泰国“经济通讯”半月刊的报道，为接受“美援”，平均泰国每人每年必须支付二十铢左右的负担。“曼谷论坛报”也指出，由于“美援”所附加的条件，“已使一千八百万泰国人民处在无限制的义务的束缚之下”。
    随着亚洲和平中立趋势的发展，泰国人民愈来愈清楚地认识到追随美国战争政策是同自己的民族利益不相容的。今年2月20日，在泰国劳工联合会及其所属的二十七个不同行业的工会成立大会上，工人们高举着表达他们愿望的标语，上面写着“实行中立政策，退出东南亚条约组织”、“进行自由贸易”、“拥护和平共处的原则”、“取消防共条例”等口号。这些正义的呼声反映了全体泰国人民的要求和利益。愈来愈多的人要求泰国政府执行独立的外交政策，摆脱美国的控制。
    由于人民压力的加强，也由于美国的殖民侵略政策与泰国统治阶级之间利害矛盾的增长，近年来銮披汶政府逐渐地改变了某些做法。1955年9月开始准许泰国人民恢复政党活动。去年6月，在英国、印度尼西亚、马来亚等国宣布了取消橡胶的“禁运”之后，泰国政府终于接受了人民的要求，作出允许商人直接和中国进行贸易，和向和平民主国家输出大米、木材、锡等非战略物资的决定。今年1月10日，泰国财政部长拍母里攀·裕他吉又对报界重申，除了战略物资，泰国商人有权同所有国家进行自由贸易。泰国当局完全不会阻止非战略物资输往中国。并且他也承认，泰国卖给中国的剩余烟叶“是获得非常优越的令人满意的价钱的”。最近銮披汶总理也表示“愿意考虑”人民所提出的执行独立的外交政策、取消“反共条例”等要求；并且说，如果他在下届政府担任总理的话，“将把上述要求交由议会讨论”。在这次大选前夕，玛兰卡西拉自由党又修改了一些对内对外的政策，譬如：制定劳工法、规定工人的工作时间和允许工人有限的集会和罢工权利、通过“大赦政治犯”的决议等。这些都是泰国政局发展中值得注意的新因素。
    銮披汶政府所采取的某些符合民族利益的措施，加上其他的条件，使玛兰卡西拉自由党在这次大选中获得了多数的选票，维持了执政党的地位。但是，毕竟由于这些改变还远远不能满足人民的要求，因此，它在这次选举中所获得的选票，同上次大选比较是大为减少了。据泰国官方发表的议会选举的最后结果，在这次选举中提出了二百多名候选人的玛兰卡西拉自由党，在议会中一百六十名第一类议员中只获得了八十二个席位；而在上届议会中该党在一百二十三名第一类议员中占一百个席位，约占议员总数的83％左右。另一方面，几乎所有的主要反对党（不论左翼政党还是右翼政党）的选票都增加了。以乃宽集团为首的民主党在议会中所占的议席，从过去的六席增加到二十八席。以新兴力量的姿态在这次大选中出现的“社会主义联合阵线”在泰国东北部各府的选举中占了优势。经济人党（社会主义联合阵线的成员）在议会中所占的席位由过去的三席增加到八席，而其领导人之一乃黜·蒲里博成为泰国这次议会选举中得票最多的候选人。
    为了更牢靠地控制泰国，美帝国主义者在这次选举中暗中支持右翼的主要反对党，企图牵制执政的玛兰卡西拉自由党，同时又兴风作浪，企图威胁现政府。在这种情况下，泰国政府于3月2日宣布全国处于紧急状态。据报道，在紧急状态期间，美国新闻处竟公开出面向示威游行的青年学生及群众散发大量的宣传品，煽动他们反对銮披汶政府。美国的这种露骨的干涉活动引起了泰国人民的愤慨，泰国官员也向美国大使毕晓普提出质问，要他解释为什么向群众“散发美国新闻处的传单”。为了掩饰这些阴谋的真相，帝国主义者就宣传什么“共产党”挑起的事件。但是这种谎言是经不起一驳的。据法新社3月6日的报道，泰国代理外交部长乃拉克·潘雅拉春在一次记者招待会上严厉地驳斥了外国流传的3月2日的“风潮”是共产党人煽动起来的说法。泰国的乃沙立元帅也曾透露暴乱是同泰国有外交关系的国家所策动的，只是“基于外交礼貌和惧怕影响了邦交关系，在目前情况下，尚不能公布”。但一些泰国报纸透露的另外一些情况，已经证明这次事件的主使者是美国。
    与此同时，美国大使毕晓普匆匆忙忙地赶赴堪培拉，出席了东南亚条约组织部长理事会议。有消息说，美国还想利用东南亚条约组织来干涉泰国。因此，泰国代理外交部长乃拉克·潘雅拉春曾严正声明，东南亚条约组织“无权”干涉泰国的内政。
    美国统治集团在泰国的这些活动，充分说明了美国侵略政策的真面目。美国口口声声说它要帮助东南亚条约组织国家“防止颠复活动”，可是事实上颠复这些国家的却是美国自己。在美国看来，它只要发现某一个国家的政府有不合美国心愿的可能，它就可以设法去推翻，即使是参加了美国军事集团的国家也不能幸免。而且，在美国看来，在这些参加美国军事集团的国家里，美国似乎更可以任意摆布它们的命运了。泰国人民从这些事实中可以更清楚地得出一个结论：要维护自己的民族利益，就必须摆脱美国的控制，执行独立自主的政策。
