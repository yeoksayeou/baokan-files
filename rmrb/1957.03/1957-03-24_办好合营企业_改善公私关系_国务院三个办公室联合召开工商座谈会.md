Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: The Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Offices of the State Council jointly held a symposium with industrialists and businessmen yesterday and today. Attending were sixty individuals from industrial and commercial circles and the Democratic National Construction Association, along with responsible individuals from relevant government departments. These individuals from industrial and commercial circles and the Democratic National Construction Association are all members of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

At the symposium, sixteen individuals from industrial and commercial circles spoke, including Chen Shutong, Li Zhuchen, Rong Yiren, Gong Tianmin, Huang Changshui, Bi Mingqi, Le Songsheng, Liu Jingji, Tang Di Yin, Chen Zubei, Li Wugui, Wang Yiming, Zhang Jingli, Wen Shaohe, and Liu Shuqing, Bangda Yangbi. They reflected on the progress of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign across the country and focused on issues such as the management of public-private joint ventures, socialist labor competitions, work arrangements for industrialists and businessmen, welfare, study, and cooperation between public and private parties, offering many opinions and criticisms.

Regarding the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, they believed that private personnel currently demonstrate high enthusiasm for participating, with many proposing rationalization suggestions. They hoped that public personnel would provide more support for these suggestions. They stated that some capitalist management methods are worth considering and should not be entirely negated. They put forward opinions on reforming the bloated organization, excessive layers, and multiple leadership found in some joint ventures. Some suggested that relevant departments in various regions convene a meeting attended by public and private representatives and worker masses to specifically study the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign in joint ventures.

Regarding the government's work arrangements for industrialists and businessmen over the past year, many expressed satisfaction. During the symposium, they believed that some remaining issues still need to be resolved, such as adjusting some inappropriately arranged jobs and continuing to arrange work for the few who are still unemployed.

Regarding study, they said that industrialists and businessmen had made great progress in the past year. Some suggested that private personnel should ideally study together with public personnel and workers in the future, to facilitate mutual assistance, mutual supervision, and joint improvement. Many joint ventures currently lack sufficient leadership for the study of private personnel and lack basic teaching materials, which they hoped could be gradually improved.

Industrialists and businessmen familiar with the situation of overseas Chinese offered some opinions on how to attract more overseas Chinese investment in the socialist construction of the motherland. Industrialists and businessmen engaged in the traditional Chinese medicine industry criticized the shortcomings of state-owned pharmaceutical companies in the work of purchasing medicinal materials. Industrialists and businessmen from ethnic minority areas reflected on the transportation difficulties and the excessively high prices of some major commodities in their areas, requesting government assistance in resolving these issues. Industrialists and businessmen from inland provinces requested that the government strengthen leadership in the transformation and study of industrialists, businessmen, and small vendors in small and medium-sized cities. They also reflected on the difficulties in handicraft production and issues in the free market.

Jia Tuofu, Director of the Fourth Office of the State Council, Xu Dixing, Deputy Director of the Eighth Office, Cheng Zihua, Deputy Director of the Fifth Office, and Wu Xuezhi, Vice Minister of Commerce, Chen Weiji, Vice Minister of Textile Industry, Lei Renmin, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade, Lian Baisheng, Director of the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Communications, Zhao Renan of the Eighth Office of the State Council, Zhang Pingzhi of the Bank of Communications, and Zhang Lizhi and Wang Rong of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, responded to relevant questions raised by industrialists and businessmen. Some questions and opinions raised at the meeting will be forwarded to relevant departments for research and resolution.

Xu Dixing focused on the ideological remolding and study of industrialists and businessmen. He said that industrialists and businessmen have made significant progress in the past year, manifested in: an increase in the number of industrialists and businessmen actively completing their assigned work; and a significant improvement in the public-private cooperative relationship in enterprises. According to incomplete statistics from eight major cities and twenty provinces including Hebei, approximately 650,000 private personnel participated in the socialist labor competition in the third quarter of last year, with 97,000 being selected as advanced workers or receiving material rewards. Short-term training classes for industrialists and businessmen across the country have also achieved good results in the enlightenment education of "destroying capitalism and establishing socialism." This progress of industrialists and businessmen is conducive to the production and operation of enterprises.

Xu Dixing said that there are also some unhealthy phenomena in the remolding of industrialists and businessmen, such as some industrialists and businessmen lacking enthusiasm for work and showing signs of loosening up; some only seeing their "wealth" side and neglecting their negative side, leading to arrogance and complacency. These people believe that public representatives are not as good as them in production and management, and workers are not as good as them in technology and culture. A few not only fail to cherish the wealth of the enterprise but even commit improper acts such as stealing enterprise property and misappropriating enterprise funds. These situations prove the existence of class relations between workers and capitalists, and the existence of class contradictions. Of course, this contradiction is a contradiction among the people. Under China's specific conditions, it does not have an antagonistic nature. However, we must not ignore it simply because it is a non-antagonistic contradiction. Recognizing the class contradiction between workers and capitalists is for us to properly handle this contradiction. Not acknowledging this contradiction is inconsistent with objective facts and is not conducive to the education and remolding of the bourgeoisie. He suggested that local organizations of the Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce should assist the government in doing a good job in the political work of capitalists.

Regarding the study issue, Xu Dixing said that private personnel who have graduated from short-term training classes should, in principle, use the enterprise as a base and, based on the principle of voluntariness, study together with workers and public representatives. This approach has already been implemented by joint ventures in some cities, and various regions can gradually expand it based on specific conditions.

Jia Tuofu said in his speech that such symposiums can reflect many problems in a very short period of time, which helps the government improve its work, and can be held frequently in various regions.

Jia Tuofu said that the production of newly joint industrial enterprises has greatly increased in the past year, with general output value increasing by 30% to 70% compared to 1955, and labor productivity has greatly increased. The quality of the vast majority of products has improved, and newly joint industrial enterprises in various regions have trial-produced many new products, costs have also been reduced, and most enterprises have turned from losses to profits. In addition, some necessary welfare facilities have been established, and wages owed to employees during the private period have also been basically repaid. However, there are still some problems in joint ventures that need to be gradually resolved in order to further consolidate and develop the superiority of joint ventures.

When talking about the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, Jia Tuofu said that this year, due to a lack of certain raw materials, there are certain difficulties in the production of joint industries. He hoped that industrialists and businessmen can use some of the good experiences of overcoming difficulties in the past private period to overcome these difficulties. The potential for savings in many joint ventures is still great. He proposed that in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, joint ventures can achieve increased production by tapping the potential of raw materials, finding new production avenues, and appropriately increasing repair and maintenance services.

In order to improve the management level of joint ventures, he talked about the various benefits of establishing enterprise management committees and employee representative conferences or employee conferences in joint ventures, requiring various regions to conduct pilot projects and gradually promote them after gaining experience. The shortcomings of excessive reporting, excessive meetings, cumbersome procedures, and large staffing that currently exist in joint ventures must be actively corrected, and the management system must be sound. In addition, attention should also be paid to giving full play to the enthusiasm of private personnel. Regarding enterprise reorganization, enterprises that have already been merged or implemented unified accounting of profits and losses last year should summarize their experiences, and those that have not been merged generally will not be merged this year.

Jia Tuofu said that the relationship between public and private cooperation is now gradually trending towards normalcy. Government departments, trade unions, federations of industry and commerce, and the Democratic National Construction Association have done a lot of work in this regard, so the number of good relationships has increased and the number of bad relationships has decreased. It is reported that there is currently a situation of: mutual respect, mutual silence, and peaceful coexistence; of course, this is much better than the past situation of mutual discrimination, mutual fear, and mutual quarrels, but it must be seen that there is still negativity in this. He requested that in the future, we can further truly achieve mutual respect, mutual consultation, and mutual criticism.

Regarding the issue of sick leave wages for private personnel, he said that he could suggest to the government that a temporary provision could be made, that is, private personnel with shares of less than 2,000 yuan can receive 50% to 70% of their sick leave wages from their original enterprises during sick leave, depending on their living difficulties and the length of their sick leave.

Jia Tuofu also explained the issues of private personnel participating in labor competitions, work arrangements for industrialists and businessmen, and retirement.

　　办好合营企业　改善公私关系
　　国务院三个办公室联合召开工商座谈会
    新华社23日讯　国务院第四办公室、第五办公室和第八办公室在昨天和今天联合召开一个工商座谈会。参加的有六十位工商界和民主建国会人士，还有政府各有关部门的负责人。这些工商界和民主建国会人士都是中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会的委员。
    在座谈会上发言的工商界人士有陈叔通、李烛尘、荣毅仁、巩天民、黄长水、毕鸣岐、乐松生、刘靖基、汤蒂因、陈祖沛、厉旡咎、王一鸣、张敬礼、温少鹤、刘淑清、邦达养璧十六人。他们反映了目前全国各地增产节约运动开展的情况，并着重就公私合营企业的管理、社会主义劳动竞赛、工商业者的工作安排、生活福利、学习以及公私共事等问题，提出了许多意见和批评。
    关于增产节约问题，他们认为目前私方人员参加增产节约运动的积极性很高，不少人提出了合理化建议，希望公方人员对他们提出的合理化建议多予支持。他们说，有些资本主义的经营方法是值得参考的，不能一概否定。对有些合营企业存在的机构臃肿、层次太多、多头领导等现象，他们提出了改革的意见。有的建议各地有关部门召集一个有公私双方和职工群众参加的会议，专门研究一下合营企业的增产节约问题。
    对于一年来政府对工商业者的工作安排，许多人表示满意。在座谈中，他们认为目前还有些遗留问题需要解决，如对有些工作安排不够妥当的应加以调整，有少数还没有工作的应该继续安排。
    谈到学习时，他们说一年来工商界人士学习有很大成绩。有的人主张今后私方人员最好能同公方人员和职工在一起学习，这样便于相互帮助、相互督促、共同提高。目前不少合营企业对私方人员的学习领导不够，并且缺少基本教材，他们希望能逐步改进。
    熟悉华侨情况的工商界人士，对于如何争取更多海外华侨投资祖国社会主义建设事业的问题提了一些意见。从事国药行业的工商界人士对国营药材公司在收购药材工作上存在的缺点提出批评。少数民族地区的工商界人士反映了当地运输上存在的困难以及某些主要商品价格偏高等情况，要求政府帮助解决。内地省份的工商界人士要求政府对中小城市工商业者和广大小商小贩的改造、学习加强领导，还反映了手工业生产上的困难和自由市场中的问题。
    国务院第四办公室主任贾拓夫、第八办公室副主任许涤新、第五办公室副主任程子华以及商业部副部长吴雪之、纺织工业部副部长陈维稷、对外贸易部副部长雷任民、交通部公路总局局长连柏生、国务院第八办公室赵忍安、交通银行张平之、中华全国总工会张立之和王榕等，分别就工商界人士提出的有关问题作了解答。会上还有些问题和意见，将由座谈会转交有关部门研究和解决。
    许涤新着重谈工商界的思想改造和学习等问题。他说，一年来工商界人士有显著进步，表现在：在工商业者中积极地完成其所负担的工作的人有所增加。企业中的公私共事关系也有显著的改进。根据八大城市和河北等二十个省的不完全统计，去年第三季度参加社会主义劳动竞赛的私方人员约有六十五万人，被选为先进工作者或获得物质奖的达九万七千人。各地的工商界短期讲习班，对于“破资本主义立社会主义”的启蒙教育，也收到了良好的效果。工商业者的这种进步，有利于企业的生产经营。
    许涤新说，在工商界人士的改造中，也存在一些不健康的现象，如有些工商业者，对工作缺乏热情、呈现松劲情绪；有的人只看到自己是“财富”的一面，而忽视了还有消极性的一面，因而骄傲自满。这些人，认为在生产经营方面，公方代表不如他们，技术文化方面，工人群众也不如他们。少数人不但不爱护企业的财富，反而干出盗卖企业财产、挪用企业资金等不正当行为。这些情况证明工人同资本家间阶级关系的存在，证明阶级矛盾的存在。当然，这种矛盾是人民内部的矛盾。在我国的具体条件之下，它并不具有对抗性。但是，我们断不能因为它是没有对抗性的矛盾，就不去重视它。正视工人与资本家间的阶级矛盾，是为了我们妥善地去处理这个矛盾。不承认有这种矛盾，是不符合客观事实的，也是不利于对资产阶级分子的教育改造的。他建议民主建国会和工商业联合会的地方组织要协助政府做好对资本家的政治工作。
    关于学习问题，许涤新说，在短期学习班结业的私方人员，在方针上，应该以企业为基地，根据自愿原则，同职工、公方一起学习。这种做法，有些城市的合营企业已经实行了，各地可以根据具体条件，逐步展开。
    贾拓夫在发言中说，这样的座谈会可以在很短的时期内反映很多问题，有助于政府改进工作，各地可以经常召开。
    贾拓夫说，一年来新合营工业生产有很大提高，一般产值比1955年提高30％到70％，劳动生产率有很大提高。绝大多数产品质量有改进，各地新合营工业都试制了许多新产品，成本也有降低，多数企业由亏损转为盈余，此外，还举办了一些必要的福利设施，私营时期拖欠职工的工资也基本上归还了。但合营企业还存在一些问题，需要逐步解决，才能使合营企业的优越性更加巩固和发展。
    贾拓夫在谈到增产节约问题的时候说，今年因某些原材料缺乏，合营工业生产上有一定困难，希望工商界人士能利用过去私营时期克服困难的一些好的经验，来克服这些困难。许多合营企业节约的潜力还是很大的。他提出在增产节约运动中，合营企业可以通过挖掘原材料潜力、寻找新的生产门路、适当地增加修配业务等办法，来达到增产。
    为了提高合营企业的管理水平，他谈到在合营企业建立企业管理委员会和职工代表大会或职工大会的种种好处，要求各地进行试点，在取得经验后逐步推广。目前合营企业中存在的表报多、会议多、手续繁、编制大等缺点，要积极改正，管理制度要健全起来。另外还要注意发挥私方人员的积极性。在企业改组方面，去年已经合并或实行统一计算盈亏的企业应该总结经验，没有合并的今年一般可以不再并了。
    贾拓夫说，公私共事关系现正在逐渐趋向正常，在这里，政府部门、工会和工商联、民建会都做了许多工作，因而关系好的增加，坏的减少了。据反映：目前有一种情况是：相敬如宾、相对无言、相安无事；当然，这比过去一度发生的某些相互歧视、相互畏惧、相互争吵的情况好得多了，但要看到，这里还带有消极性。他要求今后能进一步真正做到相互尊重、相互协商、相互批评。
    对于私方人员的病假工资问题，他说可向政府建议，暂时可作这样规定，即凡股金在二千元以下的私方人员，可以根据生活困难情况和病假时间的长短，在病假期间向原企业领取50％到70％的病假工资。
    贾拓夫还对私方人员参加劳动竞赛、工商界人士的工作安排以及退休等问题，作了说明。
