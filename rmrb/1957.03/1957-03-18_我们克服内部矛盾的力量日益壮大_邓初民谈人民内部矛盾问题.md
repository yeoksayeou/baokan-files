    We must pay attention to properly handling contradictions among the people, and we must also understand that the regularity of internal contradictions among the people for social development is objectively existent. Don't be afraid of any contradictions, and don't doubt the superiority of the socialist system when you see any shortcomings in the work.

    I participate in each and every plenary session of the National Committee of the CPPCC with the most pleasant and excited mood, because every meeting is a meeting of our unity, criticism, learning, and transformation. Before this meeting, Chairman Mao gave us profound instructions and teachings on relevant issues, which made us feel intimate, warm, relaxed, and happy. At the same time, it embodied the truth that everyone understands and solved the problems we wanted to solve.

    On the opening day of this meeting, Premier Zhou also gave us a report on his visit to eleven countries, pointing out the current international situation and China's foreign policy. Moreover, he affirmed that the international situation is favorable to us. Recently, under the pressure of the people of the world, Israel has been forced to withdraw its troops from Egyptian territory, and a new free and independent country, Ghana, appeared on the African continent on March 6. The great victory of the Jordanian people made it possible for the Anglo-Jordanian treaty to be finally terminated on March 13, etc. These facts are increasingly proving the correctness of his instructions.

    As for the domestic situation, we have thoroughly completed the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution and basically completed the Chinese socialist revolution. The current main task is to build China into an advanced industrialized socialist country. The working class and its political party—the Communist Party of China—have only held the ruling position for less than eight years, and the productive forces it has created not only exceed any historical era in our country but are also catching up with the advanced countries in the world, demonstrating a great revolutionary leap in the history of human ascent and development. The socialist public ownership system determines the new goal of social production, which is for people and to meet people's ever-growing material and cultural needs. And the people are the true creators of social progress. We are seeing the conquest of natural forces, the adoption of machines, and the change of social outlook and social atmosphere. Take the high-rise buildings in the four suburbs of Beijing, for example, they are becoming faster than paper. A large population in urban and rural areas seems to be summoned from the ground, making us feel that there are many people and great strength, and making us feel that the achievements in economic and cultural construction in the past eight years are not only achievements but also miracles.

    In this way, we have become the true masters of the country; in this way, China's international status has changed to an unimaginable height. This is merely an exaggeration; and the fact that our friends are all over the world today is an ironclad fact. The burden of great world history has been shouldered by each of us. Is it not enough to be proud of being born in the era of Mao Zedong?

    Of course, this does not mean that we have no shortcomings in our revolutionary construction work, but the achievements are always the main ones and are almost miraculous and obvious to all. In order to unite the people to fight for socialist construction, we must first affirm the achievements and at the same time pay attention to constantly checking and correcting shortcomings.

    Where do these many achievements come from? Without a doubt, it is due to the wise policies of the Communist Party of China and its guiding and leading role in the people's democratic dictatorship system. The policy of the people's democratic united front (including ethnic policies, religious policies, etc.) is becoming increasingly consolidated and expanded, and 600 million Chinese people have been closely united around the Party and Chairman Mao. Although there is still the existence of Party members and non-Party members in terms of organization, they have basically reached consensus in spirit and politics, and a closer consensus is being formed and growing. In terms of religion, ethnicity, and other social class and stratum relations, a closer consensus is also being formed and growing. It is harmful and inconsistent with the facts to overemphasize the inconsistencies manifested by the existence of Party members and non-Party members, and to overemphasize the inconsistencies in religion and non-religion and other aspects.

    Due to the historical characteristics of our revolution, there are still extremely broad petty bourgeoisie and national bourgeoisie participating in the united front. Today, there are still contradictions among the people, but the contradictions among the people in socialist society are definitely different from the class contradictions within capitalist society. This is the most important source of vitality and progressiveness of the socialist system compared to the capitalist system or any other social system.

    The party of the working class has never shied away from internal contradictions. The question is how to properly handle internal contradictions. Chairman Mao has already taught us. How did the party of the working class and the founders of Marxism view and deal with internal contradictions among the people? Marx pointed out: "As long as classes and class antagonisms no longer exist, social evolution will no longer be political revolution." ("The Poverty of Philosophy") Lenin pointed out: "Socialism must gradually grow into communism..." (Lenin: "The Tasks of the Proletariat in Our Revolution") He also said: "...it is impossible to transition to socialism without a series of gradual preparatory stages." (Lenin: "Speech at the First All-Russian Congress of Land Departments, Poor Peasants' Committees, and Communes") This means that the contradictions among the people in socialist society are realized through the gradual accumulation of new qualities and the gradual demise of old qualities after qualitative change.

    Our party and Chairman Mao have enriched and developed the Marxist-Leninist theory on internal contradictions under new conditions, pointing out that internal contradictions in socialist society are due to the contradictions between productive forces and relations of production, and the contradictions between the superstructure and the economic base. The policies of "strengthening ideological education," launching "criticism and self-criticism," "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," and "overall planning and appropriate arrangements" are the most correct policies for handling contradictions among the people. This means that contradictions among the people can only be resolved through long-term, patient, meticulous, and persuasive methods, and cannot be resolved through crude, simple, and administrative command methods. This is the regularity of socialist social development. Our democratic parties, people's organizations, ethnic groups, and people from all walks of life can only grasp the development law of socialist construction in our country as quickly as possible in terms of ideology and understanding, so that we can properly handle internal contradictions as quickly as possible.

    As everyone knows, the enemy will laugh happily when they hear that there are still contradictions among our people. There will also be some kind-hearted people among our people who are worried about internal contradictions and some uncoordinated phenomena and some shortcomings in the work. However, everyone knows that the driving force of everything's own movement is internal contradiction. Social movement is also true. Socialism must replace capitalism, which is the result of class contradiction. The contradictions among the people manifested by the contradictions between productive forces and relations of production and the contradictions between the superstructure and the economic base in socialist society are also the driving force for pushing socialism towards communism. We must pay attention to properly handling contradictions among the people, and we must also understand that the regularity of internal contradictions among the people for social development is objectively existent. Don't be afraid of any contradictions, and don't doubt the superiority of the socialist system when you see any shortcomings in the work.

    Fellow members, the law of social development cannot be shaken. Our strength in overcoming internal contradictions in the road forward and promoting historical progress is growing. As long as we are more united, study in depth, and strengthen self-transformation under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the task of building an advanced industrialized socialist country will be completed sooner and better.

    我们克服内部矛盾的力量日益壮大
    邓初民谈人民内部矛盾问题
    我们必须注意适当处理人民内部矛盾，我们又要懂得人民内部矛盾对于社会发展的规律性是客观存在的。不要看到任何矛盾就害怕，看到任何工作中的缺点就怀疑社会主义制度的优越性。
    我以最愉快兴奋的心情，参加政协全国委员会每一届每一次的全体会议，因为每一次会议都是我们团结、批评、学习、改造的会议。在这次会议之前，毛主席就有关问题为我们作了深刻的指示和教导，使我们感到亲切、温暖、轻松、愉快，同时，又体现出了人人都懂得的真理，解决了我们所要解决的问题。
    在这次会议开幕的那天，周总理又为我们作了访问十一国的报告，指出了当前的国际形势和我国的外交政策。而且肯定国际形势对于我们是有利的。最近以色列在全世界人民的压力之下，已被迫从埃及的领土上撤兵，非洲大陆又于3月6日出现了一个新的自由独立的国家——加纳，约旦人民伟大的胜利使得英约条约能于3月13日最后终止等等，这些事实都正在日益证明他所指示的正确性。
    至于国内情况，我们已经彻底完成了中国资产阶级民主革命，又基本上完成了中国的社会主义革命，当前的主要任务，是要把中国建设成为一个先进的工业化的社会主义国家。工人阶级及其政党——中国共产党取得统治地位还不到八年，而它所造成的生产力，不仅超过我国任何历史时代，而且正在迎头赶上世界先进国家，表现出了人类上升发展史上极大的革命飞跃。社会主义公有制决定着社会生产的新的目的，是为了人，为了满足人们经常增长的物质和文化需要。而人民群众正是社会进步的真正创造者。我们正在看到自然力的被征服，机器的被采用，社会面貌和社会风气的被改变。即以北京四郊的高楼大厦来说，变得比纸糊的还要快。城市农村的大量人口，好像从地底呼唤出来的一样，使我们感到人多力量大，使我们感到八年来经济、文化建设上的成绩，不仅是成绩，而且是奇迹。
    这样，我们变成了国家真正的主人；这样，我国的国际地位变到了不能想像的高度。这仅是夸大之词；而今天是我们的朋友遍于全世界，则是铁一般的事实。伟大世界历史的担子已经担在我们每一个人的肩上，我们生在毛泽东时代，还不足引以自豪吗？
    当然，这并不是说我们在革命建设工作中就没有任何缺点，但成绩总是主要的而且是近乎奇迹的、有目共睹的。为着团结人民群众进行建设社会主义的战斗，我们必须首先肯定成绩，同时注意不断检查缺点，改正缺点。
    这许多成绩是从哪里来的呢？毫无疑问，是由于中国共产党的英明政策及其在人民民主专政体系中的指导和领导作用。人民民主统一战线的政策（包括民族政策、宗教政策等等）的日益巩固和扩大，六亿中国人民，已经紧密地团结在党和毛主席的周围了。在组织上虽然还有党与非党的存在，但在精神上和政治上却已基本上达到一致，而且已在日益形成和成长着更紧密的一致。在宗教、民族及其他社会阶级、阶层关系上，也在日益形成和成长着更紧密的一致。过分强调党与非党的存在所表现的不一致性，过分强调宗教与非宗教及其他方面的不一致性，都是有害的，而且是不符合事实的。
    由于我国革命的历史特点，还有极其广大的小资产阶级、民族资产阶级参加在统一战线之内，今天人民内部的矛盾还是有的，但社会主义社会人民内部的矛盾，决不同于资本主义社会内部的阶级矛盾。这就是社会主义制度较之资本主义制度或其他任何社会制度具有生命力和进步性的最重要的根源。
    工人阶级的党，一直不讳言内部矛盾，问题在如何适当地处理内部矛盾，毛主席已教导过我们。工人阶级的党和马克思主义创始人是怎样来看待人民内部矛盾和处理人民内部矛盾的呢？马克思指出：“只要阶级和阶级对抗不再存在，社会进化就不再成为政治革命。”（哲学的贫困）列宁指出：“社会主义必然逐渐成长为共产主义……。”（列宁：“我国革命中无产阶级的任务”）又说：“……不经过一系列的逐步的预备阶段，要过渡到社会主义是不可能的”。（列宁：“在全俄土地科、贫农委员会和公社第一次代表大会上的演说”）这就是说社会主义社会人民内部矛盾，是质变经过新质的逐渐积累和旧质的逐渐衰亡来实现的。
    我国的党和毛主席在新的条件下丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义关于内部矛盾的理论，指出：社会主义社会内部矛盾，是由于还有生产力和生产关系的矛盾、上层建筑和经济基础的矛盾来的，“加强思想教育工作”，展开“批评与自我批评”，“百花齐放，百家争鸣”，“长期共存，互相监督”，“统筹兼顾，适当安排”的政策，就是处理人民内部矛盾的最正确的政策，这就是说人民内部矛盾，只能用长期的、耐心的、细致的、说服的方法来解决，不能用粗暴的、简单的、行政命令的方法来解决。这是社会主义社会发展的规律性。我们各民主党派，各人民团体，各民族，各界人士，只有在思想上、认识上争取越快越好地掌握我国社会主义建设的发展规律，才能越快越好地适当的处理内部矛盾。
    大家知道，敌人一听说我们人民内部还有矛盾，就会高兴得笑起来的；我们人民内部也会有某些好心肠的人，对于内部矛盾和某些不协调现象及工作中的某些缺点，怀着忧虑，殊不知一切事物自己运动的动力就是内在矛盾。社会运动亦然。社会主义必然要代替资本主义，就是阶级矛盾的结果。社会主义社会内部生产力与生产关系的矛盾，上层建筑与经济基础的矛盾所表现出来的人民内部矛盾，也正是把社会主义推向共产主义的推动力，我们必须注意适当处理人民内部矛盾，我们又要懂得人民内部矛盾对于社会发展的规律性是客观存在的。不要看到任何矛盾就害怕，看到任何工作中的缺点就怀疑社会主义制度的优越性。
    各位委员，社会发展的规律性是不能动摇的，我们在克服前进道路中的内部矛盾推动历史前进的力量是日益壮大的。只要我们在党和毛主席的英明领导下，更加团结，深入学习，加强自我改造，建设先进的工业化的社会主义国家的任务就会越快越好的完成。
