Xinhua News Agency, Sanmenxia, March 28th: The major project for developing and harnessing the Yellow River—the construction of the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station—is about to begin. Currently, a construction team has been formed at the Sanmenxia construction site. This team includes the backbone force trained in various water conservancy projects across the country over the past seven years since the founding of the nation, including more than 600 engineering and technical personnel.

More than 2,000 cadres of the Engineering Bureau come from relevant ministries of the Central Government and Hubei, Henan, Shandong, and other places. The Engineering Bureau has ten branch bureaus, including dam construction auxiliary enterprises, transportation, railways, design, and material supply.

The workers directly responsible for the construction of the dam have all built several famous reservoirs across the country in previous years. Skilled workers who have built the Guanting Reservoir and the Douhe Reservoir in Tangshan are now responsible for the left bank project of the Sanmenxia Dam. More than 500 veteran technicians from the Shizitan Hydropower Station in Sichuan, most of whom grew up alongside the Xiaofengman Hydropower Station in Northeast China, are now responsible for the right bank project of the Sanmenxia Dam. The tasks of mining sand and gravel materials, making concrete, and pouring concrete will be undertaken by workers from the Meishan, Foziling, Baisha, and other reservoirs in the Huai River basin.

In addition, many young engineering and technical personnel have joined this team. Here, one can almost meet students from any water conservancy school or water conservancy department in the country.

    锻炼有素的施工队伍已组成
    新华社三门峡28日电  开发和治理黄河的重大工程——修建三门峡水电站工程快开工了。现在，三门峡工地上，一支施工队伍已经组成。这支队伍包括开国七年来在各地水利建设中锻炼出来的骨干力量，其中有工程技术人员六百多人。
    工程局的两千多名干部来自中央有关各部和湖北、河南、山东等地。工程局下属坝工辅属企业、交通、铁路、设计、物资供应等十个分局。
    直接担任大坝施工的职工都是前几年修过全国几个著名的水库的。修过官厅水库和唐山陡河水库等的熟练工人，现在他们担任修三门峡的左岸工程。来自四川狮子滩水电站的五百多名老技工，多数是和东北小丰满水电站一起生长起来的，现在他们担任了三门峡的右岸工程。开采砂石材料、制作混凝土和浇灌混凝土的任务，将由来自淮河梅山、佛子岭、白沙等水库的工人担任。
    此外，还有很多年青的工程技术人员参加了这个队伍。在这里几乎可以遇到全国任何一个水利学校或水利科系的学生。
