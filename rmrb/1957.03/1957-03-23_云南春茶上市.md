　　Yunnan Spring Tea Enters the Market
　　(Our newspaper's Kunming dispatch, March 22nd) Spring tip tea picking has begun in Fengqing, Lincang, Yiliang and other places in Yunnan Province. Spring tea in Lincang and Yiliang has entered the market. Due to less rain and snow last winter, tea buds sprouted a few days later than in the past. After the spring rain, the tea buds sprouted particularly vigorously. Recently, the spring tea picking work in various places has been intense. However, because commercial departments have strengthened publicity in tea pre-purchase, commune members have realized the importance of increasing tea production and improving tea quality, and have generally made arrangements for labor to meet the arrival of the busy season.

　  云南春茶上市
    本报昆明22日电　云南省凤庆、临沧、宜良等地开始采摘春尖茶，临沧、宜良两地春茶上市。由于去冬雨水较少，茶叶发芽较过去迟了几天。春雨一降，茶芽发得特别猛。最近，各地的春茶采摘工作紧张。但由于商业部门在茶叶预购中加强了宣传，社员们认识到了增产茶叶和提高茶叶质量的重要性，对劳动力已普遍地作好了安排，迎接大忙季节的到来。
