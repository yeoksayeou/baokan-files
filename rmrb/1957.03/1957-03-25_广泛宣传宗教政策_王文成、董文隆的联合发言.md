After listening to Chairman Mao's report at the Supreme State Conference and Premier Zhou Enlai's report on his visit to eleven countries at the CPPCC meeting, we express our heartfelt support and agreement. These two reports have given me great encouragement and help.

I would like to offer some opinions on the situation and issues concerning Catholicism.

For many years, the imperialists' aggression against China has ignited a flame of unparalleled hatred in the hearts of the Chinese people. Among the foreign missionaries, there were actually a few imperialist elements who used religion to carry out aggression and serve the colonialists, and some counter-revolutionary elements who used religion as an excuse to carry out sabotage activities. In this way, they not only harmed the motherland, but also tarnished our pure church. In recent years, the ever-growing development of the motherland and the ever-improving lives and social morality of the people have not only reduced the opportunities for us Catholics to commit crimes, but also greatly helped the Catholic community to be more enthusiastic in following the rules. Therefore, we personally feel the greatness and lovability of the motherland. On the basis of raising their patriotic consciousness, the vast Catholic community has launched an anti-imperialist and patriotic movement, and a large number of model figures and advanced producers have emerged in various patriotic movements and at various work posts. In the years since liberation, the People's Government has indeed protected religious freedom and taken care of the church in various ways, such as exempting church-owned houses from real estate tax, providing financial assistance for repairing churches, and assisting the church in solving various difficulties. At the same time, the political status of Catholics has also been improved, and Catholics have participated in the People's Congresses and Political Consultative Conferences throughout the country. All these show the care and respect of the People's Government for Catholics.

Under the leadership of the People's Government, our motherland has achieved brilliant achievements in various construction undertakings, and we Catholics should also run the Catholic Church in China well. There are certainly many things to be done to run the church well, but one of the main things is to strengthen the training of Chinese clergy, both in quantity and quality, so that they can become clergy who are loyal to the motherland, enthusiastic about the church, and have both virtue and talent. We also hope that Chinese Catholic clergy who are still abroad can arouse their patriotic enthusiasm, get rid of the deceptive influence of reactionary propaganda, return to the embrace of the motherland, and serve the missionary cause of the motherland. In order to run our church well, it certainly depends on the efforts of our church itself, but it is related to the government's implementation of religious policies. Therefore, we put forward the following requests:

In the years since liberation, the government has taken many measures in implementing the policy of religious freedom and has solved many difficult problems of the church, for which we are very grateful. However, there are still some problems that need to be solved in some areas, especially in remote and distant places. Churches in some small cities and villages are still occupied, and religious life has not yet been restored; cadres in some areas use the excuse that local conditions are not yet in place or that instructions from higher authorities have not yet arrived to restrict children under the age of eighteen from receiving church education and participating in religious life. According to our experience, this practice of a small number of local cadres is not intended to violate religious policies or deliberately make things difficult for the church; however, because they do not have enough understanding or emphasis on religious policies, some regard the atheist worldview as the policy to be implemented, and they cannot distinguish between legitimate religions and reactionary secret societies, and they regard believing in religion as politically backward. Therefore, deviations inevitably occur in the implementation. In addition, some publications hold prejudices and lack a pragmatic spirit when discussing religious issues, such as equating religion itself with the use of religion, etc. In order to avoid difficulties in implementation and to better implement religious policies, we hope that the People's Committees in various places will strengthen the publicity of religious policies to the broad masses of the people, make detailed explanations of the policy of religious freedom stipulated in Article 88 of the Constitution, and print them into documents for study; organize people's representatives and CPPCC members to inspect the implementation of religious policies in various places; and give priority to handling the restoration of religious life and the return of churches and other issues.

We have confidence in the implementation of the People's Government's religious policies and the gradual resolution of relevant issues. In fact, once the Catholic community has been satisfied with religious life, they will happily give full play to their enthusiasm in production and work; for example, the cooperative organized by the Catholic village of Zhangpuqiao in Qingpu County, Jiangsu Province, and several agricultural production cooperatives in Mei County, Wugong, and Zhouzhi Counties in Shaanxi Province, the Catholic community has not only not affected production because they can normally enter the church to recite scriptures and attend Mass, but also overfulfilled their production tasks.

There are more than three million Catholics in the country, who are part of the people's democratic united front and an indispensable force in participating in socialist construction and defending world peace. In the future, we clergy must actively lead the vast Catholic community to embark on the patriotic path and jointly make more and greater contributions to the motherland. (Attached picture)

### 广泛宣传宗教政策  王文成、董文隆的联合发言

　　广泛宣传宗教政策
    王文成、董文隆的联合发言
    在最高国务会议上听取了毛主席的报告，在政协会议上听取了周恩来总理访问十一个国家归来的报告，我们表示衷心拥护和赞同。这两个报告并且给了我很大的鼓舞和帮助。
    我就天主教方面的情况和问题，发表一些意见。
    多少年来，帝国主义者对中国的侵略，已普遍燃起了中国人民无比愤恨的火焰。外籍传教士中，竟也有少数的帝国主义分子，利用宗教进行侵略活动，为殖民主义者服务，也有一些反革命分子，以宗教为借口进行破坏活动。这样他们不但危害了祖国，也玷污了我们纯洁的教会。几年来，祖国建设的日益发展，人民生活和社会道德的日益提高，这对我们天主教人士来说，不但减少了犯罪作恶的机会，而且也对教友们热心守规有很大的帮助。因此，我们亲身体会到祖国的伟大可爱，广大天主教友在爱国主义觉悟提高的基础上，开展了反帝爱国运动，在各项爱国运动中和各个工作岗位上，涌现出不少的模范人物和先进生产者。解放几年来，人民政府确实保护了宗教信仰自由，并从各方面照顾了教会，比如对教会自用房屋，免征房地产税，资助修理教堂，协助教会解决各方面的困难。同时天主教人士的政治地位也有了提高，在全国各地的人民代表大会和政治协商会议，都有天主教人士参加。这些都说明人民政府对天主教人士关怀和尊重。
    我们的祖国在人民政府的领导下，各项建设事业，取得了辉煌成就，而我们天主教人士也应该办好在中国的天主教会。办好教会当做的事固然很多，而其中主要的一项是要加强培养中国神职人才，量要多，质要好；使他们成为忠心祖国，热心教会，德才兼备的神职人员。并希望尚在国外的中国天主教士们，能够激发爱国热情，摆脱反动宣传的欺骗影响，回到祖国怀抱，为祖国的传教事业服务。为了办好我们的教会，固然有待于我们教会自身的努力，然与政府贯彻宗教政策是有关系的，故此提出以下的要求：
    解放几年来，政府在执行宗教信仰自由政策上，采取了很多的措施，解决了教会的许多困难问题，我们是非常感激的。但是有若干地区，特别是在偏僻辽远的地方，还存在着一些问题有待解决。有的小城市及乡村的教堂仍被占用，宗教生活尚未恢复；有的地区的干部以当地的条件未具备、上级指示未来到为借口，限制不满十八岁的儿童接受教会教育和参加宗教生活。据我们的体验，少数地方干部的这种做法，并非有意违反宗教政策，或故意与教会为难；不过因为他们对宗教政策认识或重视不够，有的将无神论的宇宙观当作政策执行，对正当的宗教与反动道会门，分辨不清，把信仰宗教看成政治上的落后，故在执行上，未免发生偏差。此外，有些书刊在讨论宗教问题时，抱有偏见，缺乏实事求是的精神，如将宗教本身和利用宗教混为一谈等。为了避免执行上的困难，及更好地贯彻宗教政策，我们希望各地人民委员会加强对广大人民群众的宗教政策宣传工作，将宪法第八十八条规定的宗教信仰自由政策作详尽的解释，印成文件，以资学习；组织人民代表和政协委员，到各地视察宗教政策执行情况；尽先处理恢复宗教生活和归还教堂等问题。
    我们对人民政府宗教政策的实施，及有关问题的逐步获得解决，是具有信心的。事实上，教友们一旦得到了宗教生活的满足，在生产和工作岗位上，他们就很愉快的发挥积极性；比如江苏青浦县张朴桥教友村庄组织起来的合作社，和陕西省郿县、武功、盩厔等县的几个农业生产合作社，教友们因为能正常地进堂念经望弥撒，不但未影响生产，而且超额完成了他们的生产任务。
    全国天主教友有三百多万人，是人民民主统一战线中的一部分，也是参加社会主义建设、保卫世界和平的一个不可缺少的力量。今后我们神职人员一定要积极领导广大教友，走上爱国途径，共同为祖国作出更多更大的贡献。（附图片）
