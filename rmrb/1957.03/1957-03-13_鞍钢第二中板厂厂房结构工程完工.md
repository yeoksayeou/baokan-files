    Angang Second Medium Plate Plant Factory Structure Project Completed
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Angang Second Medium Plate Plant is under construction. This modern factory was entirely designed by our country's own designers. The advanced mechanical equipment is also manufactured by our country itself.

    Since construction began in the second quarter of 1956, after nine months of hard work by the builders, the foundation and factory structure projects have now been completed. Mechanical installation is also underway. The builders are now working with selfless labor enthusiasm, stepping up their work to strive for early completion, and it is expected to be put into production this year.

    After the Second Medium Plate Plant is put into production, the annual output of medium plate in our country will more than double. At the same time, it will also produce various specifications of plate steel that are urgently needed for various industries in our country.

    鞍钢第二中板厂厂房结构工程完工
    本报讯　鞍钢第二中板厂正在建设中。这座现代化的工厂，完全是由我国设计师们设计的。先进机械设备也是由我国自己制造的。
    这座工厂从1956年第二季度开始施工以来，经过建设者们九个月的辛勤劳动，现在地基、厂房结构等工程已经完工。机械安装也正在进行中。建设者们现在正以忘我的劳动热情，加紧工作争取提前交工，预计今年就可以投入生产。
    第二中板厂投入生产后，我国中板的年产量将增加一倍以上。同时也将为我国生产出各种工业目前所迫切需要的不同规格的板钢。
