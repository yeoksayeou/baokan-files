Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 23rd. Agricultural cooperative cadres, including the famous Shanxi Province agricultural labor model Li Shunda, are generally going deep into teams and fields to participate in labor and lead production.

　　The Wuer Agricultural Cooperative in Yangqu County, famous for its democratic management, has had all of its cooperative cadres participating in labor since the beginning of spring. Female director Zhu Wenhua went to the fields the day after returning from the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference. All twenty cooperative cadres have formulated annual labor plans, averaging 110 workdays. Cotton planting model, Qu Yaoli, deputy director of the Guoguang Agricultural Cooperative in Jieyu County, and Wu Chun'an, director of the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Yicheng County, who has changed his office work style since last year, have led cooperative cadres to participate in labor since the preparation for cultivation. They have now completed 22 to 30 workdays. Li Shunda, director of the Jinxing Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shen Jilan, deputy director, and Guo Yu'en, director of the Wuyi Agricultural Cooperative, recently jointly inspected the work of the management committee with the cooperative cadres and found that a considerable number of cooperative cadres were entangled in administrative work and sitting in the office for a long time. After research and decision by the management committee, this style of work was changed. They took the lead in going to the fields to work.

　　At present, the agricultural cooperatives where the famous labor models are located have fixed the labor time and the participating teams and groups of the cooperative cadres, and have carried out division of labor and contracting; most of the cooperative cadres have formulated annual or quarterly labor plans. In addition to holding regular meeting to study work and exchange information, they will go deep into the team work for a long time every month.

　　After the cooperative cadres went deep into the teams and groups to participate in labor with the members, many changes took place in the various tasks of the cooperative. This year, all the cadres of the Wuer Agricultural Cooperative plan to do 2,400 workdays, which is double that of last year. The subsidy work of the cooperative cadres has been reduced to 2% of the total labor work of the cooperative, a decrease of one-third compared with last year. The participation of cooperative cadres in labor has encouraged the labor enthusiasm of the cooperative members, and the attendance rate of most of the cooperatives during the preparation for cultivation has reached more than 90%. The attendance rate of male laborers in the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Yicheng County reached 100%, and some cooperative members with weak labor discipline also often participated in labor.

　　After the cooperative cadres went deep into the teams and groups, they discovered problems in time, and many problems were solved locally. Li Shunda found that the quality of smoked fertilizer in the eighth group was not high during his labor in the Nansai Village production team, and immediately organized an exchange of experience with the second group with good smoked fertilizer. Wu Houlie, director of the Red Star Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Cooperative in Pingshun County, found that the quota was too high when he participated in collecting firewood on the mountain, and revised it that day. He also found that fourteen cooperative members lacked confidence in increasing production this year, and actively solved ideological problems door-to-door. The cooperative members also praised the Wuyi Agricultural Cooperative cadres for paying attention to the quality of their work, and the members proposed to learn from the cooperative cadres.

　　李顺达等积极参加田间劳动
　　社员劳动热情更加高涨，生产中的问题及时解决
    新华社太原23日电　山西省著名农业劳动模范李顺达等领导的农业社社干部普遍深入队组、田间参加劳动领导生产。
    以民主办社闻名的阳曲县五二农业社，入春以来社干部全部参加了劳动，女主任朱文华参加全国农业劳动模范代表会议归来，第二天就下了地。二十个社干部都制定了全年劳动计划，平均要做到一百一十个劳动日。植棉模范、解虞县国光农业社副主任曲耀离，和去年以来改变坐办公室作法的翼城县先锋农业社主任吴春安等，备耕以来带动社干部参加劳动，目前已做到二十二个到三十个劳动日。平顺县金星农林牧合作社主任李顺达、副主任申纪兰，和五一农业社主任郭玉恩，最近与社干部共同检查了管理委员会的工作，发现相当一部分社干部纠缠在事务工作中，长期坐办公室。经过管理委员会研究决定改变这种作风。他们首先带头下地劳动。
    目前，各个著名劳动模范所在的农业社都已固定社干部的劳动时间和参加的队、组，并且进行了分工包干；大部分社干部都已制定出全年或季度劳动计划。每月除定期召开接头会研究工作交流情况外，都将长期深入参加队组工作。
    社干部深入队、组和社员一起参加劳动后，社里各项工作有了许多变化。五二农业社全体干部今年计划做二千四百个劳动日，比去年增加了一倍，社干部的补贴工降低到全社劳动工数的2％，比去年减少三分之一。社干部参加劳动鼓舞了社员劳动积极性，大部分社备耕期间出勤率达到了90％以上。翼城县先锋农业社男劳力出勤率达到了100％，一些劳动纪律不强的社员也都经常参加了劳动。
    社干部深入队组后及时发现问题，许多问题得到就地解决。李顺达在南赛村生产队劳动中发现第八组熏肥质量不高，立即组织与熏肥好的第二组交流了经验。平顺县红星农林牧合作社主任武侯梨参加上山打柴发现定额偏高，当天就进行了修改。他还发现有十四户社员对今年增产缺乏信心，挨门逐户解决思想问题后都积极起来了。五一农业社干部作活讲究质量，也深受社员的赞扬，社员们提出向社干部看齐。
