Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, March 18th: A government delegation of the Polish People's Republic, headed by Chairman of the Council of Ministers Józef Cyrankiewicz, arrived here at 10:05 this morning on a TU-104 jet aircraft for a three-day visit to Burma as guests of the Government of the Union of Burma.

At Mingaladon Airport to welcome Cyrankiewicz and his party were Burmese Prime Minister U Nu and his wife, as well as Deputy Prime Ministers U Ba Swe, Sao Hkun Hkio, U Kyaw Nyein, and Thakin Tin.

In their speeches, both U Nu and Cyrankiewicz expressed their belief that Cyrankiewicz's visit would further strengthen the friendship between Poland and Burma.

On the way from the airport to the Presidential Residence where he will be staying, Cyrankiewicz was warmly welcomed by tens of thousands of Rangoon citizens.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 17th: The "People's Tribune" published an editorial on the 16th regarding the departure of the Polish government delegation to visit Asian countries, stating that the trip of the delegation headed by Chairman of the Council of Ministers Józef Cyrankiewicz is of great political significance.

The editorial said that the delegation will stay in countries with different systems, but these countries share the same position as us on the issue of world peace and stability. In addition to exchanging political views with the leaders of India, Burma, and Cambodia, they will also discuss the development of trade relations and cultural exchanges.

In the second stage of the trip, Cyrankiewicz will visit four brotherly countries. Friendly talks and exchange of experiences, as well as an assessment of our ideological and political allies in Asia, will naturally help to better mutual understanding, closer cooperation, and the consolidation of the socialist family.

The editorial concluded that Cyrankiewicz's visit will strengthen the international position of socialist Poland.

    西伦凯维兹率代表团抵缅甸访问
    新华社仰光18日电　以部长会议主席西伦凯维兹为首的波兰人民共和国政府代表团在今天上午十时零五分乘图—104喷气式客机到达这里，他们作为缅甸联邦政府的客人将在缅甸进行三天的访问。
    到明加拉顿机场欢迎西伦凯维兹一行的有缅甸总理吴努和他的夫人，以及副总理吴巴瑞、藻昆卓、吴觉迎和德钦丁。
    吴努和西伦凯维兹在他们致词时都表示相信，西伦凯维兹的这次访问将进一步加强波兰和缅甸之间的友谊。
    西伦凯维兹在从机场到他将下榻的总统府去的一路上，受到成千上万仰光市民的热烈欢迎。
    据新华社华沙17日电　“人民论坛报”16日就波兰政府代表团动身前往亚洲国家访问发表社论说，以部长会议主席西伦凯维兹为首的代表团的这次旅行具有重大的政治意义。
    社论说，代表团将在各种不同制度的国家中停留，这些国家在世界的和平稳定问题上和我们具有同样的立场。除了同印度、缅甸和柬埔寨的领袖们在政治上交换看法以外，还要商谈发展贸易关系和文化接触问题。
    在旅行的第二个阶段，西伦凯维兹将访问四个兄弟国家。友好的会谈和交流经验以及对我们在亚洲的思想上和政治上的同盟者的估价自然会有助于更好的互相了解，更紧密的合作和世界社会主义大家庭的巩固。
    社论最后说，西伦凯维兹的访问将会加强社会主义波兰的国际地位。
