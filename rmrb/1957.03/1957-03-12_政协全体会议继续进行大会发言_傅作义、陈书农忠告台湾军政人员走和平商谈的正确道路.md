Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The Third Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference resumed today.

    Fu Zuoyi was the first to speak at the conference this afternoon. He advised the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan that the United States is unreliable, a counter-offensive is impossible, a third world war cannot be waited for, and peaceful negotiation is the only correct path.

    The next speaker was Che Xiangchen, Deputy Governor of Liaoning Province. He said that due to the limitations of the state's financial resources, it is not yet possible to establish more schools. Therefore, he hoped that students who cannot continue their education should participate in labor that they are capable of in agricultural production, industrial production, or other fields.

    Luo Daying (彝族), Deputy Commissioner of the Xichang Prefecture in Sichuan Province, focused on introducing the democratic reform work in the multi-ethnic mixed residence area of Xichang Prefecture.

    Yang Zhengmin, Director of the Yumen Mining Bureau, said that last year the crude oil production of the Yumen Oil Mine exceeded the total of the ten years before liberation. Last year, the workers of the entire mine increased production and saved more than 10 million yuan for the country. This year, the oil mine is responsible for half of the country's crude oil production tasks.

    Fang Dingying, Director of the Hunan Provincial Department of Justice, based on what he saw during his inspection, emphasized the improvement in the lives of farmers after cooperation.

    Xie Jarong, Deputy Director of the Geological Mineral Resources Research Institute of the Ministry of Geology, said that in the future, attention must be paid to the study of basic geological theory and the strengthening of comprehensive research to find new ore bodies. Xie Jarong suggested that petroleum prospecting and exploration work be carried out in several basins west of Laojunmiao and south of Anxi and Dunhuang to find new oil fields.

    Liu Wendian, a professor at Yunnan University, said that the essence of Lao Tzu's political philosophy in China: "Produce without possessing," "Act without relying," and "Lead without dominating," has been realized one by one in today's New China.

    He Lu, a member of the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee, hoped that people would pay attention to learning and studying China's history, calligraphy, painting, medicine, architecture, poetry, music, ceramics, etc., so that China's inherent culture could be carried forward.

    Tan Qilong, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, who attended the meeting as an observer, spoke on rural issues and the supply of materials.

    Mao Yisheng, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology, introduced to the conference the tremendous development of popular science work in the past few years and the major achievements made in the work.

    Xin Shuzhi, Dean of Northwest Agricultural College, believes that agriculture in northern Shaanxi still lacks a relatively mature overall plan. He hoped that an agency would be established to comprehensively lead agricultural production and water and soil conservation work in northern Shaanxi so that agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy could truly be combined.

    Zeng Zhaoyue, Director of the Nanjing Museum, talked about the work of protecting, excavating, and sorting out cultural relics of the national cultural heritage and museum work in her speech.

    Jin Baoshan, a professor at Beijing Medical College, pointed out that the development of people's health care has achieved tremendous achievements. He believes that in the future, the situation where medical institutions only carry out treatment and lack preventive work should be changed, and attention should be paid to implementing a working system that combines medical treatment and prevention.

    Chen Shunong, who attended the conference as an observer, advised Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan and overseas to quickly respond to the call of the People's Government and, in the spirit of peace being the most valuable and patriotism being one family, work together to strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and oppose the aggression of American imperialism.

    Chen Qiyou, Chen Zhanmei, and Zhang Deqing made written speeches today.

    Chen Qiyou, on behalf of all members of the China Zhi Gong Party, guaranteed to work hand in hand with the Communist Party of China and all parties and groups to do the country's work well in all positions. He then talked about the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and the work of overseas Chinese.

    Chen Zhanmei, an overseas Chinese leader who returned from Burma to participate in the conference, said that the overseas Chinese in Burma can understand and practice Premier Zhou's instructions. They are determined to respect local customs and get along well with people from friendly countries. He hoped that the relevant government departments would effectively improve the implementation of overseas Chinese affairs policies and pay attention to the employment of returned overseas Chinese and the schooling of students returning to China.

    Zhang Deqing, Director of the Automobile Tractor Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, suggested that all industrial departments establish production increase and conservation committees to implement more comprehensive conservation.

    A total of seventeen people spoke this afternoon. In the morning, the conference held group discussions.
