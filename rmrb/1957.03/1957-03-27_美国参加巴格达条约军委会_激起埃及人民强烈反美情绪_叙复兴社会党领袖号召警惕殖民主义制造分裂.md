Xinhua News Agency, March 26th -- The United States' decision to participate in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee has greatly angered Egypt. According to an International News Service reporter from Cairo, there has not been such a surge of anti-American sentiment in Egypt since U.S. Secretary of State Dulles announced the withdrawal of U.S. aid for the construction of Egypt's Aswan High Dam.

The reporter said that the U.S. decision has given Egyptians new evidence to confirm their worst fears. Egyptian authorities say this shows that the United States is clearly trying to isolate President Nasser.

The reporter pointed out that news that the United States is resuming negotiations to grant economic aid to Israel while refusing to unfreeze Egypt's frozen $40 million has aroused even more anger.

The reporter also quoted the reaction of "Egyptian authorities" as saying that if there had ever been even the slightest chance that Hammarskjöld's personal charm and diplomacy might have enabled Nasser to accept a compromise plan for managing the Suez Canal, then all such hopes have now disappeared. Egyptian authorities said that the United States is now "linking itself to the imperialist conspiracy against Egypt through Britain, France, and the Baghdad Pact."

Xinhua News Agency, March 26th -- Damascus Dispatch: Syrian Ba'ath Party leader Hurani published an article in the newspaper on March 25th, calling for vigilance against colonialism's conspiracy to create divisions in Syria.

Hurani's party is one of the parties that make up the current Syrian government. He said, "Colonialist conspiracies create differences of opinion in order to undermine national unity." He demanded that Syria "strengthen the national front, overthrow traitors and saboteurs, and be as firm as a rock, unmoved by the tides of colonialism."

He called for promoting the Arab Federation of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan. He said that due to the results of the Bermuda Conference, it is necessary to establish this federation "in order to deal with future emergencies."

　　美国参加巴格达条约军委会
　　激起埃及人民强烈反美情绪
　　叙复兴社会党领袖号召警惕殖民主义制造分裂
    新华社26日讯　美国决定参加巴格达条约军事委员会的行动，使埃及极为激愤。据国际新闻社记者从开罗报道说，自从美国国务卿杜勒斯宣布美国撤回对建造埃及阿斯旺高水坝的援助以来，埃及还没有过这样高涨的反美情绪。
    这个记者说，美国的决定使埃及人得到新的证据，证实了他们的最坏的疑虑。埃及当局说，这表明，美国显然企图把纳赛尔总统孤立起来。
    记者指出，有消息说，美国正在恢复给予以色列经济援助的谈判，而拒绝解冻埃及的被冻结的四千万美元，这些消息引起了更多的愤怒。
    这位记者还援引“埃及当局”的反应说，如果曾经有过哪怕是微乎其微的机会，哈马舍尔德本人的魅力和外交手腕也许能够使纳赛尔接受一项管理苏伊士运河的折衷计划的话，那么所有这样的希望现在都已经消失了。埃及当局说，美国现在“将通过英法和巴格达条约同反对埃及的帝国主义阴谋联系起来”。
    据新华社26日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚复兴社会党领袖胡拉尼3月25日在报上发表文章号召警惕殖民主义在叙利亚制造分裂的阴谋。
    胡拉尼的党是组成叙利亚现政府的政党之一，他说，“殖民主义阴谋造成意见分歧以便破坏国家的团结。”他要求叙利亚“加强民族阵线，打倒卖国贼和破坏分子，像坚固的岩石一样不为殖民主义的浪潮所动。”
    他要求促进埃及、叙利亚、约旦的阿拉伯联邦。他说：由于百慕大会议的结果，有必要建立这个联邦，“以便对付将来的紧急情况”。
