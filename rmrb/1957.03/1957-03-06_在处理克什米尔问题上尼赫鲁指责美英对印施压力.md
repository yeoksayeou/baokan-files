    Nehru Accuses US and Britain of Pressuring India on Kashmir Issue

    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 5th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru said at an election rally in Kanpur, an industrial center in Uttar Pradesh, on the 4th: "We will never allow any country on Earth to put pressure on us to force us to change our position on the Kashmir issue and our policy of non-alignment." He said: "Even if pressured by the most powerful countries in the world, I will not sell India's honor and freedom."

    Nehru said that certain groups in Britain are once again trying to play the same tricks on India that they played ten years ago. He said that these groups want to extinguish the freedom movement and weaken the Congress Party and national forces. They have been lurking for ten years, but they are insidiously raising their heads again to undermine India's progress and advancement.

    Nehru said that the Baghdad Pact countries are clearly supporting Pakistan to put India at a disadvantage.

    Nehru said, "The evidence is so obvious that it may embarrass the British government, which has claimed that it has not favored anyone in the Kashmir issue. As for the United States, the Pakistani Prime Minister has also provided similar evidence."

    Prime Minister Nehru pointed out: "The United States has provided Pakistan with a large amount of military assistance. It is because of this that Pakistan is speaking to India in a 'more tough tone'."

    在处理克什米尔问题上
    尼赫鲁指责美英对印施压力
    据新华社新德里5日电　印度总理尼赫鲁4日在北方邦的工业中心斯康波尔举行的选举集会上说：“我们决不允许地球上任何国家对我们施加压力迫使我们改变我们在克什米尔问题上的立场和我们的不参加集团的政策。”他说：“那怕是受到世界上最强大的国家的压力，我也不会出卖印度的荣誉和自由。”
    尼赫鲁说，英国的某些集团再次企图对印度玩弄他们十年前所玩弄的那种手段。他说，这些集团要扑灭自由运动，削弱国大党和民族力量。他们潜伏了十年，但是他们又在阴险地抬起头来，破坏印度的进步和前进。
    尼赫鲁说，巴格达条约国家显然是支持巴基斯坦来使印度处于不利的地位。
    尼赫鲁说，“证据是这样昭然若揭，因此这可能使英国政府感到很窘，英国政府曾经自称，它在克什米尔问题上一点也没有偏袒谁。至于美国，巴基斯坦总理也提供了类似的证据。”
    尼赫鲁总理指出：“美国给予巴基斯坦大量军事援助。正是因为这样，巴基斯坦才以‘更加强硬的口气’对印度说话。”
