Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 20th: Prime Minister Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Prime Minister Široký of the Czechoslovak Republic announced in a joint communiqué signed today that the two countries had reached complete agreement on three issues: the current international situation, consolidating the unity of the socialist camp, and developing cooperation between Vietnam and Czechoslovakia.

    On the issue of the current international situation, both delegations expressed full support for the struggles of the Egyptian and Hungarian people. They expressed sympathy for the accusations of the people of the Near and Middle East against the new colonialist "Eisenhower Doctrine," and considered the Soviet Union's assistance to the Hungarian people a significant contribution to the cause of peace and socialism.

    The two delegations condemned the United States' continued obstruction of China's restoration of its legitimate seat in the United Nations and its continued occupation of Taiwan, as well as its evil policies of attempting to expand the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc and interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs.

    The two countries believe that, in the current situation, strengthening the unity of the Asian and African peoples and realizing the proposal of the Prime Ministers of China and India on signing a collective security treaty for Asian and Pacific countries is of particular importance.

    The two countries unanimously opposed the United States' conspiracy to turn South Vietnam into a military base and to drag the South Vietnamese regime into the United Nations, and demanded that the countries concerned fulfill their responsibilities under the Geneva Accords.

    On the issue of consolidating the unity of the socialist camp, both delegations gave special emphasis. Both sides believe that: "The process of socialist construction in each country is a creative process filled with the characteristics of each country, but certain general principles must be thoroughly respected at all times, because the essence of these principles is international and they have long been proven by past experience."

    Both sides believe that: "The current task of socialist countries is to vigorously strengthen the unity between countries based on the principles of equality and fraternal cooperation put forward by Lenin. Mutual care must be developed on a solid foundation of proletarian internationalism. Because the unity of the socialist countries surrounding the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and their close cooperation are a powerful guarantee for the independence and peaceful development of these countries themselves."

    On the issue of developing friendly relations between Vietnam and Czechoslovakia, the government delegations of both sides announced that they "will continue to develop friendly relations and cooperation in all fields between the two countries in accordance with the principles put forward by the Soviet government in its statement of October 30, 1956, on further developing and strengthening the friendship between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries."

    The communiqué concluded that the two governments are convinced that this visit to Vietnam by the delegation of the Czechoslovak government and the sincere exchange of views between the two governments will further strengthen the friendship and fraternal cooperation between the two countries, which will benefit the people of both countries and consolidate the cause of world peace.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 20th: A cultural cooperation agreement between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Czechoslovak Republic was signed in Hanoi today. The agreement, which is valid for five years, stipulates the exchange and publication of scientific and research documents, the exchange of scientific, cultural, educational, sports, and physical education delegations and students between the two countries.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 20th: Prime Minister Široký and the Czechoslovak government delegation he led concluded their four-day visit to Vietnam today. They left Hanoi by plane for Guangzhou at 1:30 pm.

    越捷两国总理签订联合公报
　　两国对当前国际局势、巩固社会主义阵营团结和发展两国合作等问题取得完全一致的意见
    新华社河内20日电　越南民主共和国总理范文同和捷克斯洛伐克共和国总理西罗基在他们今天签订的联合公报里宣布两国对于当前国际局势、巩固社会主义阵营的团结和发展越捷两国合作关系等三个问题上取得了完全一致的意见。
    在当前国际局势的问题上，双方代表团表示完全支持埃及和匈牙利人民的斗争。对中近东人民对新的殖民主义“艾森豪威尔主义”的控诉表示同情，认为苏联对匈牙利人民的援助是对和平和社会主义事业的重大贡献。
    两国代表团斥责美国继续阻挡中国恢复在联合国正当地位和继续侵占台湾的行动，斥责美国企图扩大东南亚侵略集团和干预印度尼西亚内政等邪恶的政策。
    两国认为，在当前的局势下，加强亚非人民的团结和实现中印两国总理关于签订亚洲和太平洋各国集体安全条约的建议具有特殊重要意义。
    两国一致反对美国变南越为军事基地和把南越政权拉入联合国的阴谋，并且要求有关各国完成自己对日内瓦协议的责任。
    在巩固社会主义阵营各国的团结的问题上，双方代表团给予特别的强调。双方认为：“每一个国家的社会主义建设的过程，都是一个充满着每个国家的特点的创造过程，但是，对于某些总的原理，却是无论在任何时候都必须加以彻底尊重的，因为这些原理的本质，是带有国际性的，它们早已为过去的经验所证明。”
    双方认为：“社会主义各国的当前任务，是大力加强根据列宁所提出的平等与兄弟合作的原则的各国之间的团结。必须在无产阶级国际主义精神的稳固基础上发展相互间的关怀。因为，环绕着苏联和中华人民共和国的社会主义各国的团结以及它们之间的密切合作，对这些国家本身的独立与和平发展，是一个强有力的保证。”
    在发展越捷两国友谊关系的问题上，双方政府代表团宣布，它们“将不断地按照苏联政府在1956年10月30日的声明中所提出的关于进一步发展和加强苏联和其他社会主义国家之间的友谊的原则，来发展两国之间的友谊关系和各方面的合作。”
    公报最后说，两国政府确信，经过捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团这一次的访问越南和两国政府之间的诚挚交换意见，将会进一步密切两国之间的友谊和兄弟般的合作，有利于两国人民和巩固世界和平的事业。
