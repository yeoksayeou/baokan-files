I fully endorse Chairman Mao's speech and the reports of Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Li, and I agree with the work report of the Standing Committee.

Now, I would like to report to the Congress on the situation of intellectual and scientific work in Tianjin over the past year. Since the Party Central Committee convened the conference on intellectual work, called for a great march towards science, and put forward the policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend," Tianjin's intellectual and scientific research work has made significant progress, mainly reflected in the following aspects:

　　Improvements in the working and living conditions of intellectuals, and the commencement of scientific research

First, the relevant departments have widely and deeply conveyed and discussed the spirit of the Party Central Committee's instructions and the policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend." The vast number of intellectuals have been greatly encouraged, have a further understanding of the Party's policies, and their enthusiasm has been further enhanced. There have also been significant changes in the ideological outlook of intellectuals. Academic thinking has begun to become active, and the desire for political progress is increasing day by day. Many intellectuals have joined the Chinese Communist Party or other democratic parties.

Second, due to the initiative and leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CPC, various departments in Tianjin organized more than 400 scientific and technical experts to formulate a draft outline of Tianjin's twelve-year scientific and technological research plan based on the needs of national construction and the actual situation in Tianjin. Through this planning work, a preliminary understanding has been gained of the major scientific and technological problems existing in the city's industrial and agricultural production and urban construction, as well as the strength of the city's scientific and technological community. It has been initially proposed that 51 research projects should be focused on and resolved within twelve years, providing a general direction for future scientific research. This planning has also facilitated communication between departments and disciplines, which is conducive to the exchange of experience and coordination. Many schools, hospitals, enterprises, and factories throughout the city have also formulated specific scientific research work plans for their departments in accordance with the instructions of the relevant central departments and with reference to the requirements of the city's plan, and have made arrangements for the scientific research and professional work of scientists. Many scientific and technical workers have already begun research work in a planned manner, and the slogan of marching towards science has become a practical action. For example, Nankai University and Tianjin University held scientific discussion meetings last year and presented many valuable papers. The first Tianjin Medical Science Conference presented more than 250 papers and reports.

Third, the utilization, working conditions, and living conditions of intellectuals have been improved. The inappropriate use of intellectuals and the situation of not using people for their expertise have been improved over the past year. Many units have inspected these phenomena and taken measures such as transferring jobs, changing positions, and assigning assistants. For example, all universities and colleges have added a large number of teaching assistants and administrative assistants. Some senior experts have obtained specialized assistants for scientific research, and many professors have been assigned the task of supervising graduate students. Many senior physicians have been freed from general treatment tasks and focused their main efforts on solving difficult and complex cases and training senior talent. Many engineering and technical personnel have been transferred from administrative positions to technical positions. In order to ensure the professional time of intellectuals, various units have made considerable efforts. At present, most intellectuals basically have their professional time guaranteed for six-fifths of the working day. In terms of books and materials, the Municipal People's Committee alone has allocated more than 300,000 yuan to enrich municipal libraries. The 600,000 uncatalogued books in the Municipal People's Library have now begun to circulate, a large number of books and periodicals have been purchased, three specialized reading rooms have been added, and the exchange of books and periodicals between libraries and ports has been strengthened. In addition, a new medical library has been built, and a science and technology library is about to be established. The work of books and materials in universities, factories, and hospitals has also been greatly strengthened. In terms of the supply and repair of scientific equipment, the municipal commercial department has established a specialized service organization - the Tianjin Scientific Supplies and Equipment Supply Service Department. In the past month or so, 50 units have raised 165 equipment problems that have not been solved for a long time, and 122 of them have been resolved. The instrument and experimental fees of various units have greatly increased. In terms of living conditions, the relevant units have made active and possible improvements under the existing conditions to ensure that intellectuals have more energy and time to devote to their professional work.

Fourth, administrative leading bodies for scientific work have been established, a number of research and experimental institutions have been expanded, and the work of various academic organizations has been strengthened. In order to effectively promote scientific research, coordinate the pace of work in various aspects, and promptly solve practical problems in academic research, Tianjin has established a Science and Technology Work Committee and has allocated 870,000 yuan from the local budget as scientific research funding. At present, the work of this organization has been initially launched. In order to effectively carry out scientific research, in addition to strengthening the city's original scientific research and experimental institutions, the central and local departments have also added a number of research and experimental institutions according to needs and possibilities. Among them, the local industrial and health departments alone have newly established 17 research and experimental institutions. In terms of academic organizations, the original specialized societies of natural sciences have enriched their manpower and strengthened their work. In addition, five societies in philosophy and social sciences have been established. Obviously, the establishment and strengthening of these administrative bodies, research institutions, and academic organizations is conducive to the development of scientific research and academic activities.

  　Overcoming the tendencies of arrogance, neglecting politics, and being divorced from reality, as well as the phenomenon of not paying attention to economy

The above situation shows that Tianjin's intellectual and scientific work has made great achievements over the past year. On the one hand, the ideological level of intellectuals has been further improved; on the other hand, leading bodies for scientific work have been established, the direction of scientific research has been pointed out, research bases have been expanded, and research conditions have been improved, paving the way for the smooth development of scientific research. The enthusiasm of intellectuals to march towards science has been greatly enhanced. However, scientific work is a long-term, meticulous, and complex work. Although scientific work is not a new work in our country, due to the weak foundation in the past, the current development is very broad and the speed is also very fast, so there are still many issues that need attention. I will only raise the following two issues that currently need attention.

First, we must pay attention to the ideological education of intellectuals. In general, the ideological level of intellectuals has been significantly improved over the past year. However, among some people, undesirable tendencies such as individualism, arrogance, neglect of politics, and detachment from reality have even grown somewhat over the past year. Some people bury themselves in their work, believing that good work is good politics. A few people are very indifferent to theoretical study, and even deny the guiding role of dialectical materialism in scientific research. If these ideas are not corrected for a long time, they will inevitably have a far-reaching impact on scientific research.

Second, the issue of correctly implementing the policy of "running science diligently and thriftily." Building the country diligently and thriftily and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily is a basic policy of socialist construction. Scientific research is no exception. Scientific research must be carried out in a focused and step-by-step manner based on needs and possibilities and in the spirit of simplification and thrift. It is impossible and should not be spread out across the board regardless of priorities. Some people are too idealistic and demand too high and too urgent research conditions. Some people even think that it is wrong to not talk about economy in scientific research, which must be persuaded. However, scientific research also has its characteristics. Under normal circumstances, achievements cannot be made and problems cannot be solved without guaranteeing the minimum equipment conditions. Therefore, it is also extremely important to correctly use the possible funds and maximize their effectiveness. (Attached picture)

### 天津市一年来的知识分子工作和科学研究工作　刘锡瑛的发言

专栏：

　　天津市一年来的知识分子工作和科学研究工作
　　刘锡瑛的发言
    我完全拥护毛主席的讲话和周总理、李副总理的报告，并同意常务委员会的工作报告。
    现在我向大会报告一下一年来天津市的知识分子工作和科学工作的情况。自从党中央召开了知识分子工作会议，号召向科学大进军，并提出了百家争鸣、百花齐放的方针以来，天津市的知识分子工作和科学研究工作获得了显著的进展，主要表现在以下方面：
　  知识分子的工作、生活条件都有改善，科学研究工作已经开展起来
    第一、各有关部门都广泛深入地传达和讨论了党中央的指示精神，讨论了百家争鸣、百花齐放的方针，广大知识分子受到了极大的鼓舞，对党的方针政策有了更进一步的了解，积极性有了进一步的提高。知识分子的思想面貌也有了显著的变化。学术思想开始活跃，政治上的进步要求日益增强，有不少知识分子参加了中国共产党或其他民主党派。
    第二、由于中共天津市委的倡议和领导，天津市各部门组织了四百多位科学技术专家，根据国家建设要求和天津市的实际情况，制定了天津市十二年科学技术研究规划纲要（初稿）。通过这次规划工作，对本市工农业生产和城市建设中所存在的重大科学技术问题、对本市科学技术界的力量，有了初步了解，初步地提出了十二年内应当着重研究解决五十一项研究项目，为今后开展科学研究提出了大致的方向。通过这次规划，还沟通了各部门和各学科的关系，有利于经验交流和协调工作。全市很多学校、医院、企业、工厂并已根据中央有关部门的指示，参照本市规划的要求，具体地制定了本部门的科学研究工作规划，对科学家的科学研究和业务工作作了安排。许多科学技术工作者已经有计划地进行研究工作，向科学进军的口号，已成为实际的行动。例如南开大学、天津大学在去年都召开了科学讨论会，提出不少有价值的论文。天津市第一届医药科学讨论会，就提出了二百五十多篇论文和报告。
    第三、改善了知识分子的使用状况、工作条件和生活条件。知识分子使用不当、用非所学的状况一年来有了改进。许多单位对这些现象进行了检查，并采取调动工作、改变职务、配备助手等办法。例如，各高等学校都增添了大批教学辅助人员和行政助手，有些高级专家已获得了科学研究上的专门助手，许多教授担负了带研究生的任务。许多高级医师摆脱了一般性治疗任务，而把主要力量用在解决疑难大症和培养高级人才方面。许多工程技术人才从行政岗位转入技术岗位。为了保证知识分子的业务时间，各单位都作了不少的努力。目前，大多数知识分子基本上保证了六分之五工作日的业务时间。在图书资料方面，仅市人民委员会便拨出了三十多万元充实市级图书馆。市人民图书馆的六十万册未编目藏书，现已开始流通，增购了大批书刊，增辟了三个专门阅览室，加强了馆际和埠际的书刊交流。此外，新建了一所医学图书馆，即将建立一所科学技术图书馆。各高等学校、工厂、医院的图书资料工作也大为加强。在科学器材的供应和修配方面，市商业部门已经建立了专门服务机构——天津市科学用品器材供应服务处，在最近一个多月内，有五十个单位向他们提出了一百六十五项长期未得解决的器材问题，已有一百二十二项获得解决。各单位的仪器实验费大大增加。在生活条件方面，各有关单位都在现有的条件下，作了积极的尽可能的改善，保证知识分子有更多的精力和时间从事于业务工作。
    第四、建立了科学工作的行政领导机构，扩充了一批研究实验机构，加强了各种学术团体的工作。为了切实推动科学研究，协调各方面工作的步调，及时解决学术研究中的实际问题，天津市成立了科学工作委员会，并从地方预算中调剂八十七万元作为科学研究经费，目前，这个机构的工作已经初步展开。为了切实开展科学研究，除了加强本市原有的科学研究和实验机构以外，中央和地方的各部门还根据需要与可能，增设了一批研究和实验机构，其中仅地方工业、卫生部门即新建了十七个研究和实验机构。在学术团体方面，原有的自然科学各专门学会已充实了人力，加强了工作。此外，并建立了哲学和社会科学方面的五个学会。显然，这些行政机构、研究机构和学术团体的建立和加强，是有利于科学研究和学术活动的展开的。
  　克服自高自大、忽视政治、脱离实际 的倾向和不讲求节约的现象
    以上情况说明，一年来，天津市的知识分子工作和科学工作有了很大的成绩。一方面，知识分子的思想水平有了进一步的提高；另一方面，建立了科学工作的领导机构，指出了科学研究的方向，扩大了研究据点，改善了研究条件，为科学研究工作的顺利开展铺平了道路。知识分子向科学进军的积极性大大提高。但是，科学工作是一个长期的、细致的、复杂的工作。科学工作在我国虽然不是一个新的工作，由于过去的基础薄弱，现在的发展面很广，速度也很大，需要注意的问题还是不少。我只提出以下两个目前需要注意的问题。
    第一、必须注意对知识分子的思想教育工作。总的方面，一年来知识分子的思想水平较前有了显著的提高。但是，在部分的人当中，个人主义、自高自大、忽视政治、脱离实际等不良倾向一年来甚至有些滋长。有些人埋头业务，认为业务好就是政治好。有个别的人对理论学习十分冷淡，甚至否认辩证唯物主义对科学研究的指导作用。这些思想如果长期得不到纠正，不能不对科学研究工作发生深远的影响。
    第二、正确地贯彻“勤俭办科学”的方针问题。勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业是社会主义建设的一条基本方针。科学研究事业也不能例外。科学研究必须根据需要与可能，本着精简节约的精神，有重点有步骤地开展。不可能也不应当不分轻重缓急全面铺开。有些人过于理想，对于研究条件要求过高过急，甚至有些人认为在科学研究上不应当讲节约是不对的，是必须加以说服的。但是科学研究工作也有它的特点。在一般的情况下，不能保证最低限度的设备条件是不能取得成绩和解决问题的。因此正确地使用可能有的经费，发挥最大的效能，也是极其重要的问题。（附图片）
