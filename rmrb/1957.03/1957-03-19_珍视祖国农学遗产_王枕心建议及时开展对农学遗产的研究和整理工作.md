Cherish the Agricultural Heritage of the Motherland
Wang Zhenxin Suggests Timely Research and Arrangement of Agricultural Heritage

I wholeheartedly support the reports of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou, and fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Chen Yun, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong.

In the old society, I made no contribution to the revolutionary cause and even made many mistakes in politics. After liberation, the Party and the government gave me meticulous care, education, and help. As someone who is now right but was formerly wrong, I feel particularly ashamed and invigorated. Being invited to participate in the CPPCC this time is an enormous encouragement and spur to me, making me deeply feel the greatness of the Communist Party and the warmth of the revolutionary ranks. In the future, I must wholeheartedly accept the leadership of the Communist Party, thoroughly transform my thinking, establish a revolutionary outlook on life, and serve the people wholeheartedly, so as not to fail the care and expectations of the Communist Party.

Currently, our country is in a great high tide of socialist revolution, and socialist construction is being carried out on a large scale. I would now like to offer some immature opinions on how to improve agricultural production technology.

Since Chairman Mao called for carrying forward the cultural heritage of the motherland, the medical, literary, and artistic heritage of the motherland have received social attention and are constantly developing. However, little attention has been paid to the agricultural heritage of the motherland, which cannot but be a regret for carrying forward the cultural heritage of the motherland.

China's agronomy has a long history. As early as the Spring and Autumn period, Fan Li summarized the freshwater fish farming experience of fishermen in Taihu Lake and wrote a "Fish Farming Classic." By the Warring States period, the "Yu Gong," which described farmland water conservancy and agricultural production technology, appeared. After that, there were many agronomic works in each dynasty, with an incomplete total of more than 1,700. These many valuable agricultural heritages are the accumulation of experience and the crystallization of wisdom of the working farmers in production practice throughout the ages.

In the past, in semi-feudal and semi-colonial China, all natural sciences were subject to certain restrictions, and agricultural science was no exception. Now that we are liberated, in order to build socialism, in order to respond to Chairman Mao's call to march towards science, it is of course necessary for our agricultural scientists to absorb foreign agricultural scientific achievements, especially to learn from the advanced experience of Soviet agriculture, to improve agricultural science and technology and develop agricultural production. However, agriculture is, after all, regional to a certain extent. Therefore, it is also entirely necessary to cherish the inherent agricultural heritage of the motherland in a timely manner.

In ancient Chinese agricultural books, there are indeed many records that coincide with the principles of modern agricultural science. For example, the fruit tree grafting technique in "Bianmin Tuzuan" can not only change the shape and color of fruits and improve the quality of fruits, but also prolong the fruiting age. This is because the change in metabolism changes the plant type and changes the plant heredity, which is consistent with the scientific principle of asexual approach of distant hybridization. Moreover, the erudition and completeness of "Qi Min Yao Shu" are even more difficult to describe completely. The methods of opening up terraced fields on hills, setting up ditches, and covering the soil all year round can be said to be the world's earliest advanced cultivation methods. It can not only avoid soil erosion, but also increase the activity of microbial communities in the soil, increase the effective components of potassium and phosphorus in the soil, and improve the aggregate structure in the soil. This also conforms to the scientific principle of the relationship between microbial activity and soil development. As for production technologies such as equidistant sowing, appropriate dense planting, rational fertilization, and ensuring full seedlings, a complete set of methods was already available in "Lü Shi Chunqiu" as early as 2,200 years ago. Therefore, Soviet expert A.B. Ivanov gave a very high evaluation to the experience of Chinese farmers in production technology and natural selection and cultivation of excellent varieties, as well as veterinary treatment, both in practice and in scientific research. However, these agricultural heritages are all descriptions and summaries of experience, and have not been further scientifically analyzed and explained. Most of them know what is happening but not why. Therefore, many people have overlooked its scientific value. If we can use scientific methods to sort them out, "eliminate the crude and extract the essence," and combine them with modern agricultural science, this will not only be a great contribution to China's agricultural production, but also enrich the content of world agricultural science.

Therefore, I suggest that the government promptly organize the necessary specialized institutions in the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, hire old experts in the agricultural field, establish the necessary systems, and, with leadership and planning, carry out research and arrangement of the agricultural heritage of the motherland to carry forward the agricultural heritage of the motherland, improve the level of agricultural science, and thus promote the rapid development of agricultural production and complete the socialist construction of agriculture at an early date.

Words to Old Friends in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao: Pluck up the Courage and Return to the Embrace of the Motherland

Finally, I would also like to take this opportunity to say a few words to many old friends in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao:

Friends in Taiwan: You have been away from the embrace of the motherland for several years. During this long period of time, you must have suffered enough bullying and humiliation from American imperialism, and some friends may have even reached the point of "eating up your savings" and being "at the end of your rope." The pressure of such a realistic life should be unbearable. However, due to the deception and cover-up of reactionary propaganda, there may still be many concerns in your minds: Will you be given leniency by the people of the motherland after returning to the motherland? Will you be spurned and despised by the people of the motherland? Here, I would like to advise you in the capacity of an old friend that this concern is completely unfounded. You are all Chinese, and you already have an unprecedentedly powerful motherland. Everyone loving their motherland is not only a matter of course, but also does not distinguish between before and after. Taiwan is an inalienable and sacred territory of China, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. In the struggle to liberate Taiwan, Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the people of the whole country, has repeatedly issued a call to you: Liberating Taiwan is a matter for the Chinese people themselves, and we can strive to resolve it peacefully. As long as you make contributions to this struggle, everything can be "pardoned for the past" and "rewarded for meritorious service." In fact, more and more former military and political personnel who have returned to the embrace of the motherland have not only been warmly welcomed by the people of the motherland, but have also been properly arranged in all aspects. "Bystanders see clearly, but those involved are confused." Now is the time for you to listen to good advice and come to your senses. Living under the eaves of others is not so comfortable, so I hope you will not hesitate, wait and see, and make mistakes again and again. You should pluck up the courage and return to the motherland resolutely, reunite with your family and friends, and work together with the people of the whole country to crush the conspiracy of American imperialism to invade China and jointly build a beautiful and happy motherland.

### 珍视祖国农学遗产  王枕心建议及时开展对农学遗产的研究和整理工作

    珍视祖国农学遗产
    王枕心建议及时开展对农学遗产的研究和整理工作
    我衷心拥护毛主席和周总理的报告，并完全同意陈云副总理、李富春副总理和陈叔通副主席的报告。
    我过去在旧社会里，对革命事业并没有贡献，在政治上还有过不少错误。解放后党和政府对我无微不至的关怀、教育和帮助，作为一个今是昨非的我来说，格外感到惭愧和振奋。这次被邀参加政协，对我更是一个极大的鼓舞和鞭策，使我深深感到共产党的伟大和革命队伍中的温暖。今后我一定要衷心接受共产党的领导，彻底改造自己的思想，建立革命的人生观，全心全意为人民服务，才不辜负共产党对我的关怀和期望。
    目前我国是处在伟大的社会主义革命高潮中，社会主义建设正在大规模的进行，我现在就有关提高农业生产技术的问题，提出一点不成熟的意见。
    自从毛主席号召发扬祖国文化遗产以来，祖国的医学、文学和艺术遗产都受到社会的重视，并在不断地向前发展。但是对祖国农学遗产，却还很少有人注意，这对发扬祖国文化遗产来说，不能不是一个缺憾。
    我国农学具有悠久的历史，远在春秋时代，范蠡就总结了太湖渔民的淡水养鱼经验，写了一本“养鱼经”。到战国时代，更进一步有叙述农田水利和农业生产技术的“禹贡”出现，以后每个朝代都有不少有关农学的著作，根据不完全统计，约有一千七百多种，这许多宝贵的农学遗产，都是历代劳动农民在生产实践中的经验积累和智慧的结晶。
    过去处在半封建半殖民地的我国，一切自然科学，都受到一定的限制，农业科学当然也不能例外。现在我们解放了，为着建设社会主义，为着响应毛主席向科学进军的号召，我们的农业科学工作者要吸取外国的农业科学成果，尤其是学习苏联农业的先进经验，来提高农业科学技术，发展农业生产，固然是必要的。但是，农业毕竟是具有一定的区域性。因此，对祖国固有的农学遗产，及时给以应有的珍视，这也完全是必要的。
    在我国古农书中，的确有许多记载是与现代农业科学原理不谋而合的。例如：“便民图纂”里面的果树嫁接技术，不但能够改变果实形状、色彩，提高果实品质，而且还能延长结果年龄。这是由于新陈代谢型的变化，变更了植物型体，改变了植物遗传性，与远缘杂交的无性接近法的科学原理是相符合的。又如“齐民要术”的渊博完整，更是难以尽述，其中的山丘开辟梯田，设置撩壕和常年复盖土壤等方法，可以说这是世界上最早的先进耕作方法。它不但可以避免水土流失，而且还能增加土壤中微生物群落的活动，增进土壤中钾、磷的有效成分，改进土壤中的团粒结构。这也符合微生物活动对土壤发育关系的科学道理。至于等距播种，适当密植，合理施肥，保证全苗等生产技术，早在二千二百年以前“吕氏春秋”里，已有一套完整的方法。所以苏联专家阿·波·伊万诺夫同志，对我国历代农民生产技术和自然选择与培育的优良品种，以及兽医的治疗等经验，不论在实践上或科学研究上，都曾给以极高的评价。不过这些农学遗产，都是属于经验的叙述和总结，而没有能进一步加以科学的分析和说明，大都是知其然不知其所以然。因而也就使很多人忽视了它的科学价值。如果能够运用科学的方法，加以整理，“去粗取精”，使之与现代农业科学相结合，这不仅对我国农业生产是很大的贡献，而且也丰富了世界农业科学的内容。
    因此我建议政府，及时在农业科学院，组织必要的专门机构，聘请农业界的老专家，建立必要的制度，有领导，有计划，开展对祖国农学遗产的研究和整理工作，来发扬祖国的农学遗产，来提高农业科学水平，从而促进农业生产的迅速发展，提早完成农业社会主义建设。
    寄语台湾港澳旧友鼓起勇气，毅然返回祖国怀抱
    最后，我还要利用这个机会对台湾和港澳的许多旧朋友说几句话：
    在台湾的朋友们：你们离开祖国的怀抱已经几年了。在这段漫长的岁月里，想必你们是受够了美帝国主义的欺凌和侮辱，甚至还有些朋友“坐吃山空”到了“山穷水尽”的地步。这样的现实生活的逼迫，照理应该是忍无可忍了。但由于反动宣传的欺骗蒙蔽，在你们的思想上也许还存在不少的顾虑：回到祖国后是不是会获得祖国人民的宽大；是不是会遭到祖国人民的唾弃和鄙视？在这里我愿意以旧朋友的资格劝告你们，这种顾虑是完全没有根据的。你们都是中国人，你们已经有了一个空前强大的祖国，每个人热爱自己的祖国，不仅是天经地义，而且也是不分先后的。台湾是中国神圣不可分割的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾。在解放台湾的斗争中，周恩来总理曾经代表全国人民一再向你们发出召唤：解放台湾是中国人民自己的事情，我们可以争取用和平的方式求得解决。只要你们在这一斗争中作出了贡献，一切都可以“既往不咎”，“立功受赏”。事实上，目前愈来愈多的先后回到祖国怀抱的旧军政人员，不仅受到了祖国人民的热烈欢迎，而且在各方面都得到了适当的安排。“旁观者清，当局者迷”，现在已是你们听取忠言，幡然悔悟的时候了，寄人篱下的生活，既不是那么好受，那就希望你们不要迟疑、观望、一误再误，应该鼓起勇气，毅然返回祖国，同你们的家人、亲友重新团聚，同全国人民一道粉碎美帝国主义侵略中国的阴谋，共同为建设美好幸福的祖国而努力。
