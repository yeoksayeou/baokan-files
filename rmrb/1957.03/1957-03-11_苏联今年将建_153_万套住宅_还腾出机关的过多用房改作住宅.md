Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 10th: According to the plan approved by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will build 1.53 million housing units this year with state funds and subsidized private construction, an increase of 28% over last year.

	If we compare the execution index of housing construction in the three post-war five-year plans of the Soviet Union, we can see that the growth rate of housing construction in the Soviet Union is very fast. From 1946 to 1950, the Soviet Union built more than 2,413,000 new housing units with state funds alone. By the end of 1955, another 3,513,000 housing units had been added. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1956-1960), it is planned to build more than 6,833,000 new housing units.

	If we compare the quantity of housing construction in the Soviet Union with that of other countries based on the assumed unit of measurement adopted by the United Nations Housing Committee, it becomes even more interesting. For example, in 1955, 8.2 houses were built per 1,000 residents in the Soviet Union, 6.5 in the United Kingdom, 4.9 in France, and 4.6 in Italy. By 1960, more than 20 houses will be built per 1,000 residents in the Soviet Union.

	In addition to building new housing, the Soviet Union has also adopted the method of vacating excessive office space in government organizations for conversion into housing to solve the housing problem. For example, more than 100 government organizations in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, have vacated more than 13,000 square meters of houses for housing. In Boli, in the eastern part of the Soviet Union, 7.5 million square meters of houses have been vacated from the offices of some government organizations.

### 苏联今年将建153万套住宅  还腾出机关的过多用房改作住宅

    苏联今年将建153万套住宅
    还腾出机关的过多用房改作住宅
    据新华社莫斯科10日电　根据苏联最高苏维埃批准的计划，苏联今年将以国家资金和自费公助的方式建造一百五十三万套住宅，比去年多28％。
    如果把苏联三个战后五年计划房屋建筑的执行指数对比一下，就可以看出苏联住宅建设增长的速度是很快的。1946年到1950年，苏联仅用国家资金就建造了二百四十一万三千多套新住宅。到1955年年底，又增加了三百五十一万三千多套住宅。在第六个五年计划（1956—1960年）中，预定要建造六百八十三万三千多套新住宅。
    如果根据联合国住宅问题委员会通过的假定的度量单位，再把苏联住宅建设的数量同其他国家对比一下，就更有意思。例如，在1955年，在苏联每一千个居民建筑了八点二幢住宅，在英国是六点五幢，在法国是四点九幢，在意大利是四点六幢住宅。而到1960年，苏联每一千个居民就将建筑二十多幢住宅。
    苏联除了建造新住宅以外，还采取了腾出过多的机关用房改作住宅的办法，来解决住宅问题。例如乌克兰首都基辅一百多个机关已经腾出了一万三千多平方公尺的房屋作为住宅。在苏联东部的伯力，已经从一些机关的办公处腾出七千五百万平方公尺的房屋。
