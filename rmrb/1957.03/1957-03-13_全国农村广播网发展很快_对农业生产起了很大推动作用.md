The construction of wired broadcasting networks in rural areas of China achieved tremendous development last year amidst the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement. As of now, there are 1,390 rural broadcasting stations nationwide, with over 440,000 loudspeakers. Except for Tibet, more than half of the counties and suburban areas of large cities across the country have established broadcasting stations. Provinces like Jilin, Liaoning, Guangdong, and Fujian have already achieved station coverage in every county and loudspeaker coverage in most townships. The vast majority of loudspeakers are distributed in public places such as agricultural cooperatives, production teams, supply and marketing cooperatives, district and township governments, and primary schools, as well as in the homes of farmers; a small number are distributed in county towns. A few counties and villages have installed enough loudspeakers to basically cover every household. For example, in Lu'an County, Shanxi Province, 3,112 loudspeakers were installed in 37 townships, 310 natural villages, 286 agricultural cooperatives, and 1,945 households, averaging about one loudspeaker for every 20 households. In Xigou Village, Chaoyang County, Liaoning Province, more than 150 loudspeakers were installed in 280 households, averaging less than one loudspeaker for every two households. If we calculate an average of 80 listeners per loudspeaker, the number of listeners to wired broadcasts across the country every night reaches approximately 30 million. In addition, there are nearly 30,000 rural radio stations nationwide. Thus, wired broadcasting constitutes a massive rural propaganda network in the vast rural areas of our country. The broad masses of rural people are connected to the capital and provincial capitals through broadcasting.

The development of the rural broadcasting network has effectively facilitated the guidance of work by the Party and the government and has promoted the development of agricultural production. For example, counties like Fuyang in Zhejiang and Longchang in Sichuan used broadcasting stations last year to organize farmers to carry out the "Thousand Catty Grain," "Ten Thousand Catty Sweet Potato," and "Thousand Cart Ten Thousand Load" high-yield and fertilizer accumulation campaigns, playing a significant role in increasing production. Many broadcasting stations also frequently organize advanced model figures to introduce typical experiences, achieving good results in popularizing agricultural production techniques and advanced experiences.

The weather forecast programs of the broadcasting stations also play a significant role in coordinating production, preventing natural disasters, and protecting seedlings and harvests. During the severe typhoon in early August last year, leading cadres in Gaochun County, Jiangsu Province, used broadcasting to mobilize farmers to reinforce dikes overnight before the typhoon arrived, ensuring that not a single breach occurred in the dikes of the Gucheng, Shijiu, and Danyang Lakes and all the embankments within the county, and saving more than 200 acres of mature early rice from damage.

In addition, the leading organs of many counties have also made full use of the rapid and timely characteristics of wired broadcasting to issue policy instructions to rural cadres, reducing the number of three-level meetings and saving a large amount of meeting expenses and time, allowing the broad masses of grassroots cadres to have more time for practical work. Through regular propaganda on current affairs and policies, socialist education, and cultural and artistic programs, broadcasting stations have also greatly enlivened the political and cultural life of rural areas. In this way, broadcasting stations have gained the attention of local leading organs and the broad masses, allowing the broadcasting cause to take root among the people.

    全国农村广播网发展很快
    对农业生产起了很大推动作用
    本报讯　我国农村有线广播网建设事业，去年在农业合作化运动高潮中，获得巨大发展。到目前为止，全国农村广播站已有一千三百九十个，带喇叭四十四万只以上。除西藏外，全国半数以上的县和大城市郊区都已建立了广播站，吉林、辽宁、广东、福建等省已经县县有站和大部分乡有喇叭。所有喇叭绝大部分都分布在农业社、生产队、供销社、区乡政府、小学校等公共场所和广大农民的家里；少数分布在县城。有少数县和乡村安装的喇叭数量已经基本上普及到农户。如山西潞安县在三十七个乡、三百一十个自然村、二百八十六个农业社和一千九百四十五户里有喇叭三千一百二十只，平均二十户左右便有一只喇叭。辽宁省朝阳县西沟村二百八十户装喇叭一百五十多只，平均不到两户就有一只喇叭。如按平均每只喇叭有八十人收听计算，全国每晚有线广播的听众约达三千多万人。此外，全国还有将近三万个农村收音站。这样，有线广播在我国广大农村中就构成了一个规模巨大的农村宣传网。广大农村群众通过广播已经和首都、省会连系起来。
    农村广播网的发展，有效地便利了党和政府指导工作，推动了农业生产的发展。如浙江富阳和四川隆昌等县，去年曾运用广播站组织农民开展了“千斤粮”、“万斤薯”和“千车万担”的丰产、积肥运动。对增加生产起了很大的推动作用。许多广播站还常常组织先进模范人物作典型事迹介绍，在推广农业生产技术和先进经验上也取得了很好的效果。
    广播站的天气预报节目，在配合生产、预防天灾、保苗保收等方面的作用也很显著。去年八月初大台风期间，江苏高淳县领导干部在台风到来前夕，利用广播动员农民连夜上堤，使境内固城、石臼、丹阳三湖湖堤和全部圩堤没有一处决口，并抢救了二百多亩已经成熟的早稻免遭损失。
    另外，许多县的领导机关还充分利用了有线广播的迅速、及时的特点，向农村干部下达政策指示，减少了许多三级会议，节省了大批开会的费用和时间，使广大基层干部可以有更多的时间用于进行实际工作。广播站通过经常的时事政策宣传、社会主义教育和文艺节目，也大大地活跃了农村的政治文化生活。这样，广播站就得到了地方领导机关和广大群众的重视，使广播事业在群众中生了根。
