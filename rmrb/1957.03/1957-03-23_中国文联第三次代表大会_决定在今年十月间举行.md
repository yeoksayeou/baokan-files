　　China Federation of Literary and Art Circles Third Congress
　　Decided to be Held in October This Year
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Third Congress of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles is scheduled to be held in Beijing in October. This decision was made at an enlarged meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles held in Beijing on the 20th of this month.

    In the four years since the Second Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers was held in 1953, due to the decisive victory of the socialist revolution and the Chinese Communist Party's proposal of the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," new developments have taken place in literary and artistic work. In order to adapt to this new situation, the main task of the Third Congress of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles is to further expand the unity of the literary and art circles on a new basis, mobilize all creative forces, and strive to build a socialist national new literature and art.

    During the conference, various literary and art associations and research societies will also hold representative conferences or expanded council meetings at the same time; re-elect the National Committee of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the councils of various associations and research societies; expand the leadership composition, so that representative figures from all aspects of the literary and art circles will participate in the leadership institutions, and make the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and various associations and research societies the broadest organizations of all literary and art workers.

    The meeting will revise the constitutions of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and various associations and research societies; and study the work tasks and organizational forms of the federations of literary and art circles in various provinces and cities.

    The meeting will discuss the main issues in current literary and artistic work in accordance with the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." Particular emphasis will be placed on discussing creative issues and inheriting and carrying forward national traditions.

    The enlarged meeting of the Presidium of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles was presided over by Mao Dun and Zhou Yang, vice-chairmen of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Fourteen members of the Presidium of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, twenty-eight national committee members in Beijing, and heads of various associations and research societies attended the meeting.

    The meeting approved the application of the China Photographic Society, which was established in December last year, and admitted them as group members.

　　中国文联第三次代表大会
　　决定在今年十月间举行
    据新华社讯　中国文学艺术界联合会第三次代表大会定10月间在北京召开，这是中国文学艺术界联合会本月20日在北京举行的主席团扩大会议上决定的。
    自从1953年召开中国文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会后四年来，由于社会主义革命取得了决定性的胜利、中国共产党提出了“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，文艺工作有了新的发展。为了适应这一新的情况，文联第三次代表大会的主要任务是在新的基础上进一步扩大文艺界的团结，动员一切创作力量，为建设社会主义的民族的新文艺而奋斗。
    大会召开期间，文艺界各协会和各研究会也将同时举行代表大会或扩大理事会。改选文联全国委员会和各协会、各研究会的理事会，扩大领导成分，使文艺界各方面有代表性的人物都参加到领导机构中来，使文联和各协会、各研究会成为全体文艺工作者最广泛的组织。
    会议将修改中国文联及各协会、各研究会的章程；并研究各省、市文联的工作任务和组织形式。
    会议将依据“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，讨论当前文艺工作中的主要问题。特别着重讨论创作问题和继承、发扬民族传统等问题。
    这次举行的文联主席团扩大会议由中国文联副主席茅盾、周扬主持。参加会议的有文联主席团委员十四人，在京全国委员二十八人以及各协会和各研究会的负责人等。
    会上通过接受在去年12月间成立的中国摄影学会的申请，吸收他们为团体会员。
