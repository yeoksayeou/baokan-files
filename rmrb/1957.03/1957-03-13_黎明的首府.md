    The Capital of Dawn
    Liang Shangquan
    Jinghong—"The Capital of Dawn,"
    The flower of Xishuangbanna!
    Flowers bloom on the banks of the Lancang River,
    Dewdrop-like lights illuminate the farmers' homes.
    In a farmer's home there is an old Dai woman,
    Standing under the coconut tree in front of the thatched cottage,
    Looking at the office building of the Autonomous Prefecture,
    Gently speaking to the brightly lit windows there—
    Every night, every night, meetings are held there,
    Negotiating plans for peaceful land reform:
    My granddaughter, our peasant representative,
    Say what you have to say quickly!
    I, a poor peasant who has suffered all my life,
    Only gained a head full of white hair,
    I gave the landlord a lifetime of blood and sweat,
    And I should also water my own land! My own mud!
    When the cooperative is established in the future,
    I will love it as I love my granddaughter,
    Absorbing the fragrance of rice flowers all year round,
    Busily harvesting the ripe crops all year round.
    You, the window that brings happiness,
    I have so much hope and so much to say to you:
    Looking and looking, I want to see the dawn enter the door!
    Speaking and speaking, I want to speak until the sky is full of rosy clouds!
    June 2, 1956

    黎明的首府
    梁上泉
    允景洪——“黎明的首府”，
    西双版纳的鲜花！
    鲜花开在澜沧江边，
    露珠般的灯火照亮了农家。
    农家有位傣族老妈妈，
    站在茅屋前的椰子树下，
    望着自治州的办公大楼，
    对那通明的窗户轻轻地说话——
    每夜，每夜，那儿都在开会，
    协商和平土改的计划：
    我的孙女儿，我们的农民代表，
    你有话就赶快说吧！
    我这个苦磨一世的贫农，
    只换来满头白发，
    给领主流了一辈子的血汗，
    也应该浇自己的土地！自己的泥巴！
    等将来成立了合作社，
    我要像爱孙女儿一样爱它，
    一年四季饱吸那稻花的香气，
    一年四季忙收那熟透的庄稼。
    你啊，带来幸福的窗户，
    我对你有那么多的希望那么多的话：
    望呀望呀，要望到黎明走进门！
    说呀说呀，要说到满天起云霞！
