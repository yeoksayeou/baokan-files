The spring ploughing season has already begun in the beautiful spring scenery of southern China.

Agricultural production cooperatives in Guangdong Province are launching a large-scale spring ploughing production campaign with high production enthusiasm, striving for a bumper agricultural harvest this year. The Red Flag Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nanhai County, one of the special prize winners of the 1956 Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Labor Model, together with thousands of agricultural cooperatives in the province, further exerts the superiority of the cooperative system to provide more grain and raw materials for the country's socialist construction.
