    Heilongjiang's Eighty-One State Farms
    Strive to Produce 670,000 Tons of Grain This Year
    Farm Tool Repair, Manure Accumulation, and Seed Selection are Underway; More Than Twenty Farms Launch a "Do a Good Job in Spring Preparation" Competition

    (Our Newspaper News) In mid-February, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of persons in charge of state-owned farms, ranches, reform-through-labor farms, and military reclamation farms throughout the province to discuss how to mobilize the employees of the province's eighty-one state farms to strive for a bumper harvest on nearly 480,000 hectares of sown area this year. The meeting studied how to carry out a mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy, implement the policy of running farms diligently and thriftily, and how to strengthen political and ideological work and improve leadership style in the great bumper harvest movement.

    Based on the nation's strength and the current reality of state-owned farms, the meeting determined that this year's work policy is to consolidate achievements, improve quality, and strive for a bumper harvest this year, creating conditions for future development. All state-owned farms in the province are required to continue to carry out the movement for increasing production and practicing economy and the great bumper harvest competition, and to play a pioneering role in the province's agricultural bumper harvest movement, striving to complete the sowing of 480,000 hectares and produce 670,000 tons of grain.

    In order to achieve this task, the meeting believes that it is necessary to greatly increase the application of manure, do a good job in inter-tillage and weeding, improve varieties, do a good job in land preparation, comprehensively improve the quality of operations, and increase the yield per unit area. Animal husbandry should also be vigorously developed.

    In terms of business management, we should implement the policy of running farms diligently and thriftily, carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, further strengthen the responsibility system, strengthen financial and planned management, reduce costs, eliminate waste, and gradually move business management towards order and systemization.

    In terms of Party leadership and strengthening political and ideological work, the meeting emphasized the need to implement the division of labor and responsibility under the collective leadership of the Party committee, vigorously strengthen political and ideological work and grass-roots branch work, constantly implement the mass line work method, establish a firm idea of relying on employees to run the farm well, share weal and woe with the employees, devote most of our energy to delving into the fields, studying and solving production problems, and eliminate bureaucratic habits. The meeting also called on local and county Party committees to strengthen leadership over state-owned farms in terms of organization and work.

    At present, in order to achieve a bumper agricultural harvest this year and play a pioneering role in the national campaign to strive for a bumper harvest, more than twenty state-owned farms, such as Keshan, Erlongshan, and Jiusan, are launching a major competition to "do a good job in spring preparation." The farm tool repair work of these farms has been nearly 70% completed. If parts can be supplied in a timely manner, most farms can complete the repair by the beginning of March. Five farms, including Ning'an, Shuguang, and Jixian, are cooperating with each other to accelerate the progress of repairs, sharing resources and solving many difficulties of lacking parts and insufficient equipment. The main crop seeds of most farms have been prepared, and most have been carefully selected and germination tested. Seed disinfection, malt fertilization, constant temperature soaking, and turning and drying are underway.

    The manure accumulation campaign has been widely launched, and each farm has proposed to "accumulate more, ferment well, and deliver quickly." The Erlongshan Farm has accumulated more than 1,600 tons in just over a month, and the Volunteer Soldier Farm on the Volga River is sending manure to the fields day and night.

    The responsible comrade of the Provincial State Farm Bureau said: "This year's spring preparation work has a large task and many difficulties, but the speed is very fast and the quality is also good, which can completely guarantee the timely spring plowing production." (Gong Wanzhong)

    黑龙江八十一处国营农场
    力争今年生产六十七万吨粮食
    检修农具和积肥选种工作正在进行  二十多个农场开展“做好备耕”大竞赛
    本报讯  2月中旬，中共黑龙江省委召开了全省国营农、牧场，劳改农场和军垦农场负责人会议，讨论了怎样动员全省八十一处国营农场的职工力争今年近四十八万公顷播种面积的大丰收问题。会议就开展群众性增产节约运动，贯彻勤俭办场方针，以及在大丰收运动中怎样加强政治思想工作，改进领导作风等问题，作了研究。
    会议根据国家力量和当前国营农场的实际情况，确定今年的工作方针是巩固成绩，提高质量，力争今年大丰收，为今后发展创造条件。要求全省各国营农场，继续开展增产节约和丰产大竞赛运动，并在全省农业大丰收运动中起先锋作用，力争完成四十八万公顷播种面积，生产六十七万吨粮食的任务。
    为了实现这一任务，会议认为，必须大量增施粪肥，做好中耕、锄草工作，改良品种，做好整地工作，全面提高作业质量，增加单位面积的产量。畜牧业也应大力发展。
    在经营管理方面，应贯彻勤俭办场方针，开展增产节约运动，进一步加强责任制度，加强财务和计划管理，降低成本，杜绝浪费，使经营管理逐渐走向秩序化与制度化。
    在党的领导和加强政治思想工作方面，会议强调要贯彻党委集体领导下的分工负责制，大力加强政治思想工作与基层支部工作，经常贯彻群众路线的工作方法，树立牢固的依靠职工办好农场的思想，同职工共甘苦，用大部分精力去深入田间，研究与解决生产问题，扫除官僚主义的习气。会议还要求各地、县委在组织上、工作上对国营农场加强领导。
    目前全省各国营农场为了实现今年农业大丰收，并在全国争取大丰收运动中起先锋作用，克山、二龙山、九三等二十多个国营农场正在展开“做好备耕”的大竞赛。这些农场的农具检修工作已完成近70％，如果零件能及时供应，大部分农场到3月初可全部完成检修。宁安、曙光、集贤等五个农场为了加快检修进度，互相协作，互通有无，解决了很多缺零件和设备不足的困难。大部分农场的主要作物种籽已齐备，多数作了精选和发牙试验。种籽的消毒、麦芽肥育、恒温浸、翻晒等工作正在进行。
    积肥运动已普遍开展起来，各场提出要“积的多，发的好，送的快”。二龙山农场仅一个多月就积了一千六百余吨，伏尔基河荣军农场正日夜不停向田间送粪。
    省国营农场厅负责同志说：“今年备耕工作任务大，困难很多，但是速度很快，质量也好，完全可以保证适时进行春耕生产。” 	（宫万钟）
