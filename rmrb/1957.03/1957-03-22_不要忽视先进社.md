　　Do Not Neglect Advanced Cooperatives
　　By our correspondent Gao Changren

　　Editor's Note: When the Secretary of the Yueyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hunan Province conducted an in-depth inspection of spring plowing preparations earlier this month, he discovered that the Qunxing Agricultural Cooperative, classified as a first-class cooperative, was slow to begin its preparations. He identified the reasons and helped the cooperative's cadres begin to solve the problems and launch the spring plowing activities. This was entirely necessary. The situation of the Qunxing Cooperative is not unique. Leaders in some areas tend to fix agricultural cooperatives into three types, assuming that first-class cooperatives are advanced and therefore will not have any problems, so they can be left alone, focusing only on second and third-class cooperatives. As a result, some problems that originally existed in first-class cooperatives gradually become serious, affecting the spring plowing work. The example of the Qunxing Cooperative shows that classifying agricultural cooperatives into three basic types for differentiated treatment and strengthening the leadership of second and third-class cooperatives is necessary. However, this classification is not absolute or necessarily entirely accurate, and even advanced cooperatives are not perfect. Some may even have some relatively important problems. Therefore, in leadership work, there must be both focus and differentiation, but also comprehensive consideration, appropriately paying attention to solving the problems of first-class cooperatives, and never neglecting one for the other, abandoning leadership over first-class cooperatives.

When Hunan Province’s counties were consolidating agricultural cooperatives last winter and this spring, they generally divided the agricultural cooperatives into three types: first-class (advanced), second-class (intermediate), and third-class (backward). The leadership energy of various county committees was concentrated on the second and third-class cooperatives. The results show that this approach was correct. After the consolidation, most of the second and third-class cooperatives were consolidated. The production enthusiasm of the masses has been improved, directly promoting the current spring plowing preparations.

However, in many places, the Party committees have only focused on the leadership of the second and third-class cooperatives, while relaxing their attention to the first-class cooperatives with a better foundation. They handed over the consolidation work of the first-class cooperatives entirely to the branches, and did not intervene themselves at all. As a result, the consolidation work of many first-class cooperatives became a formality. Many specific problems affecting the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members were not resolved, seriously hindering the current spring plowing production. The Qunxing Agricultural Cooperative in Yueyang County is a prominent example.

The Qunxing Cooperative is a first-class cooperative with a relatively good foundation in Yueyang County. Last year it had a bumper harvest, and each member received more than 700 catties of grain. In the first year after collectivization, income increased significantly, and no one doubted the superiority of the agricultural cooperative. However, many people were dissatisfied with some specific problems within the cooperative. For example, after the autumn harvest distribution last year, the cooperative's financial accounts have not been published, and members suspect that the accountant is embezzling; the cooperative's surplus production reward system is unreasonable, with men and women receiving different pay for the same work; the work style of individual cooperative cadres is not good, and they often scold people... During the consolidation of the cooperative, the members were worried about the cadres and did not raise these opinions. Some cooperative cadres thought that the members had few opinions and were willing to end the process hastily. Some cooperative cadres clearly knew that the members had opinions, but they did not have the courage to admit their mistakes and improve their shortcomings, so they did not dare to expose the problems. In this way, some specific problems that were easy to solve at that time were dragged down, gradually developing into serious problems that seriously affected this year's spring plowing. According to the inspection of the Secretary of the Yueyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in early March, the spring plowing preparation work of this first-class cooperative, which originally had a very good foundation, was very poor: water conservancy and manure accumulation work had not yet begun; the feeding of draught cattle was not good, most of them had lost weight, and some were even sick; large and small farm tools were still scattered in the homes of the members, and no one cared about which ones should be repaired and which ones should be added; no members could be seen working in the fields, and the cooperative committee only held its first meeting from the autumn harvest distribution to early March this year.

The more serious problem is that the township and cooperative cadres have not yet been alarmed by the serious situation of this cooperative. When the township general branch secretary introduced the situation to the county party secretary, he also said that this cooperative was a first-class cooperative and that the masses had great enthusiasm for production. The cooperative cadres also reported a lot of achievements to the county party secretary, and did not mention at all what problems still existed in the cooperative. The members were very anxious about the slow progress of the spring plowing preparations. However, they did not dare to express their opinions to the cooperative cadres, and hoped that the higher authorities would send cadres to inspect the work and help them solve the problems. When the Secretary of the Yueyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party went deep into the members to visit the members, they revealed the whole truth. Now, with the specific help of the county party secretary, this cooperative is beginning to solve the problems and carry out spring plowing activities.

The situation of the Qunxing Cooperative is not unique in Hunan Province. According to the Secretary of the Xinhua County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, this county is also the same as Yueyang County, and the spring plowing preparation work of the first-class cooperatives is not as good as that of the second and third-class cooperatives. The main reason is also that the leadership of the first-class cooperatives was relaxed during the consolidation of the cooperatives. In early March, the Xinhua County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made arrangements at an enlarged cadre meeting: in the comprehensive inspection of spring plowing production, attention should be paid to strengthening the leadership of the first-class cooperatives and solving the important problems that hinder spring plowing production in these cooperatives. The Jianxin Agricultural Cooperative in this county did not solve specific problems during the consolidation of the cooperative, and the members were unwilling to work. Later, the township general branch secretary helped them solve these specific problems, and more than 400 people went to work every day, and the spring plowing production was carried out smoothly.

Now the busy farming season is approaching, and all agricultural cooperatives should be mobilized. In order to enable the first-class cooperatives to continue to play a demonstration role in production, it is necessary to quickly check the spring plowing preparation work of the first-class cooperatives and help them quickly solve various existing problems. If it is delayed any longer, some first-class cooperatives will also become second or third-class cooperatives.

　　不要忽视先进社
　　本报记者　高长任
    编者按　中共湖南岳阳县委书记在本月上旬深入检查备耕情况的时候，发现属于一类社的群兴农业社备耕工作迟迟不动，并且找出了原因，帮助社干部着手解决问题，开展备耕活动。这样做，是完全必要的。像群兴社的情况，在目前不是个别的。有些地方的领导机关往往把三种类型的农业社固定起来，以为一类社既然是先进的，似乎就不会再有什么问题，可以放手不管了，而只把注意力集中在二、三类社；以致一类社原来就存在的一些问题逐渐严重起来，影响备耕工作。群兴社的例子说明：把农业社基本上划分成三类，以便分别对待，加强对二、三类社的领导，这是必要的；但这种划分并不是绝对的，也不一定是完全确当的，而且先进社也不会是十全十美的，有的甚至还存在一些比较重要的问题，因此，在领导工作中，既须有重点、有区别，又须全面照顾，适当注意解决一类社的问题，决不可顾此失彼，放弃对一类社的领导。
    湖南省各县在去冬今春整顿、巩固农业社的时候，一般地都把农业社划分为三个类型，即一类社（先进的）、二类社（中间的）和三类社（落后的）。各个县委的领导精力都集中在二类社和三类社。结果表明，这种作法是对的。经过整顿之后，多数二类社和三类社都巩固了。群众的生产积极性提高了，直接推动了当前的备耕工作。
    但是，有不少地方的党委仅仅抓紧了对二、三类社的领导，却放松了对于基础较好的一类社的注意。他们把一类社完全交给支部去整顿，自己根本没有过问。这样，有不少一类社的整社工作就流于形式，许多影响社员生产积极性的具体问题没有解决，严重地妨碍了当前的春耕生产。岳阳县群兴农业社就是一个显著的例子。
    群兴社是岳阳县基础较好的一类社，去年丰收，每一个社员分到七百多斤粮食。在高级化后的第一年增加许多收入，没有人怀疑农业社的优越性。可是，对于社内的某些具体问题，许多人是不满意的。例如，去年秋收分配以后，社里的财务账目还没有公布，社员怀疑会计员贪污；社里的超产奖励制度不合理，男女同工不同酬；个别社干部作风不好，常常骂人……。整顿合作社的时候，社员对干部有顾虑，没有把这些意见提出来。有的社干部以为社员意见不大，愿意草草收场。有的社干部明明知道社员有意见，因为没有承认错误、改进缺点的勇气，不敢把问题暴露出来。这样，把在当时很容易解决的一些具体问题拖下来，逐渐发展成严重影响今年春耕的大问题。据中共岳阳县委书记在3月上旬到这个社的检查，这个原来基础很好的一类社，备耕工作却做得很差：水利和积肥工作还没有着手；耕牛喂养不好，大部退了膘，有的还生病；大小农具还分散在社员家里，哪些该修整，哪些该添置也无人过问；田里看不到社员出工，社委会从秋收分配到今年3月初才开第一次会议。
    更严重的问题，是乡、社干部对这个社的严重情况还没有引起警惕，乡总支书记向县委书记介绍情况时，还说这个社是一类社，群众生产劲头大。社干部也向县委书记汇报了一大堆成绩，根本不提社内还存在什么问题。社员们对备耕工作迟迟不动的情况非常着急。但是，他们不敢向社干部提意见，而希望上级派干部来检查工作，帮助他们解决问题。当中共岳阳县委书记深入到社员中访问社员的时候，他们才把全部真相吐露出来。现在，这个社在县委书记具体帮助下，正着手解决问题，开展备耕活动。
    像群兴社的这种情况，在湖南省还不是个别的。据中共新化县委书记谈，这个县也同岳阳县一样，一类社的备耕工作反而不如二、三类社。主要原因也是在整社工作中放松了对一类社的领导。3月上旬，中共新化县委在扩大干部会上已作了布置：在全面检查春耕生产中，要注意加强一类社的领导，解决这些社中妨碍春耕生产的重要问题。这个县的建新农业社在整社中没有解决具体问题，社员都不愿意出工，后来乡总支书记帮助他们解决了这些具体问题，每天就有四百多人出工，春耕生产顺利开展了。
    现在农忙季节已经迫近，所有的农业社都应该动起来了。为了使一类社在生产中继续发挥示范作用，要赶快检查一类社的备耕工作，帮助他们迅速解决存在的各种问题。如果再拖延下去，有些一类社也会变成二类社或三类社。
