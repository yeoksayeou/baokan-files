I completely agree with and support Chairman Mao's important speech at the Supreme State Conference, and the various reports by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yun, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong at the CPPCC meeting, and I am willing to implement them in my work.

Now, I would like to express some opinions from the perspective of a commercial worker.

Socialist Commerce in Progress Has Achieved Great Success, but Serious Shortcomings are Constantly Being Discovered

During the period of national economic recovery and construction, China's state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party, the government, and higher commercial organizations, the supervision and support of the broad masses of the people, and the efforts of all commercial workers, have expanded and accelerated commodity circulation, invigorated urban and rural material exchange, stabilized market prices, met the needs of people's production and life, thereby consolidating the leading position of socialist commerce, and achieving a decisive victory in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce; and continuously learning, summarizing and promoting advanced experience, continuously reducing circulation costs, accumulating construction funds for the state, and organizing the export of relevant materials in a planned way to ensure the import of materials needed for national construction, thereby promoting the continuous expansion and rapid development of industrial and agricultural production. During this time, socialist commerce achieved great success and created a historical role.

However, in the process of commercial work's advancement, serious shortcomings have also been constantly discovered, especially in the second half of 1956, mainly in the organization of commodity supply, business management, and the quality of service. The specific situation will not be discussed in detail here, as everyone is familiar with it. The tight market supply situation once aroused dissatisfaction among some people, who criticized state-owned and cooperative commercial departments, and even complained about the Party and the government, especially reflected in the fact that it was listed as one of the important topics in people's congresses in some regions.

There is no doubt that the occurrence of the above situation is inseparable from the insufficient work of commercial workers in implementing the Party and government's policies and guidelines, studying and familiarizing themselves with the changes and development of objective economic laws, investigating and studying the needs of production and life, and the insufficient understanding of the importance of socialist commerce during the period of socialist construction. In particular, the lack of an effective spirit of catching up to overcome the shortcomings that can be overcome in commercial work itself has increased the tension of certain commodities in certain regions. Problems in Commercial Work

Problems Arising from the Main Contradiction Between the Advanced Socialist System and the Backward Social Productive Forces; Problems Arising from Contradictions Between Various Sectors of the National Economy; Problems of Planned Production and Consumption Distribution.

However, there is also another aspect to the problem. As Vice Premier Chen Yun pointed out: "This is because the degree of increase in social purchasing power in 1956 exceeded the degree of increase in these materials." Therefore, it brought difficulties to commercial work that cannot be overcome by itself alone. I think it is necessary to elaborate on this:

First, there are the problems arising from the main contradiction between the advanced socialist system and the backward social productive forces. In the process of the transformation of the main domestic contradiction, it is prominently manifested in commercial work, because in the socialist social system that has been basically established, the people's need for rapid economic and cultural development and the contradiction that the current economy and culture cannot meet the needs, is the decentralized feeling of the broad masses of the people, which becomes a concentrated reaction through the commercial sector. 1956 was a year of overall upsurge in the entire national economy under the promotion of the socialist high tide. The total industrial output value increased by 27.7% compared with 1955; agricultural grain production increased by about 20 billion jin compared with 1955 despite the great disaster, which is enough to show that the progress and production increase of our country on the production front are huge, and can meet the general needs of the people in production and life. However, from the perspective of people's economic life, under the advanced socialist system, it is bound to put forward many requirements related to production and life, and the socialist system itself also puts forward various economic and cultural requirements, which cannot be measured by general needs. At the same time, from the perspective of developing productive forces, the victory of the bourgeois democratic revolution and the socialist revolution has paved the way for developing productive forces. Because of the characteristics of our country as a backward agricultural country, the level of productive forces is still low, especially the agricultural and sideline production, which still accounts for a large proportion, and is almost manual operation, which makes the current agricultural and sideline production unable to meet the growing needs. Moreover, there has been a decline in the production of certain commodities such as live pigs and vegetable oil in recent years. In addition, the expansion of basic construction, the rapid increase in labor employment, the large increase in workers' wages, and the increase in farmers' purchasing power have prompted a temporary shortage and tension in the supply of certain materials.

Secondly, there are the problems arising from the contradictions between various sectors of the national economy. The domestic economic situation in 1956 was a year in which a large number of non-socialist economic components were rapidly transformed into the only socialist economic form in the upsurge of socialist transformation that turned the world upside down. Therefore, the various sectors of the entire national economy cannot be closely linked and coordinated, and some links still have defects. As the "Eighth National Congress" pointed out, the ten major relationships need to be comprehensively coordinated. Before coordination is achieved, the problems that occur will also be concentratedly reflected in the commercial sector. For example, the industrial layout, the arrangement between the collective interests and personal interests of agricultural and handicraft cooperatives, the centralized and decentralized handling of various economic systems, the development of industrial and agricultural production and the coordination of transportation, etc. If the coordination is not enough, problems will appear to varying degrees. In particular, the excessive emphasis on the simultaneous advancement of basic construction in certain departments and certain regions has brought about an unprecedented shortage of building materials, the allocation and concentration of a large amount of labor, which has led to a large amount of wages demanding a large amount of living materials, and the timely setting up of corresponding retail commercial networks, etc., which shows that it is finally manifested in the commercial sector and exposed to the masses of the people by it.

Thirdly, there is the problem of planned production and consumption distribution. Only under the socialist system can the correct compilation of the national economic plan and the possibility of it be achieved, and can production and distribution be carried out rhythmically in accordance with the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy. However, we cannot currently include all production and distribution within the scope of the plan. This is not only limited by its natural conditions, technical conditions, etc. in production, but also rapidly changes with the continuous upsurge of the entire country's politics, economy, and culture in terms of people's lives. We recall that among the commodities that were relatively tight in the previous stage, in addition to industrial products such as steel and coal, agricultural and sideline products all had the characteristics of being restricted by natural conditions and unstable production, such as livestock, poultry, vegetables, aquatic products, and Chinese medicinal materials. At the same time, there are also great differences in the needs of the people's material and cultural life. For example, last year, a high tide of marching towards science and culture was set off throughout the country, and paper was particularly tight. Subsequently, raw materials such as bamboo and scrap cloth became tight, which affected the production of native paper and handmade cloth shoes in some areas. The lack of native paper increased the scope of using toilet paper as a substitute, which also affected the habit of urban people using toilet paper. The insufficient supply of cloth shoes expanded the sales of rubber shoes and leather shoes. The supply of rubber was limited to a certain extent, and the supply of leather shoes was affected by live pigs, so there were problems with the supply work. For example, last year, the health department in Sichuan Province proposed to eradicate female trichomoniasis, and the Chinese medicinal material Coptis chinensis became a commodity in short supply. In the campaign to eliminate the four pests, the earth nitrate used to make gunpowder was sold out.

Economic life is closely linked with political and cultural life. Today, people's lives must be rich and colorful, and rapidly changing. If a certain commodity becomes the focus of common demand, then whether to want it or not, to want more or less, becomes a major issue that cannot be ignored. Therefore, in a country with 600 million people, it takes a long struggle to make the production plan and consumption distribution seamless. Measures to Solve Problems in Commerce

The Party and the Government are Gradually Solving the Problems of National Construction and Improving People's Livelihood; Appropriately Arranging the Coordination and Coordination of Various Sectors of the National Economy; Launching a Campaign to Increase Production and Practice Economy; Further Improving Commodity Circulation Work.

In summary, it shows that although commercial work is an important link in the entire national economy and a strong bond between producers and consumers, it is bound to be affected by objective and multiple aspects, thereby affecting people's production and life. Then, does that mean that the problems existing in commerce are insurmountable? My personal understanding is this: Since the "Eighth National Congress," the Party and the government have been taking various current and long-term measures, and these problems have been solved or are being solved, especially the following points:

1.  The spirit of the Party's policy at the "Eighth National Congress" is to rely on the masses, mobilize all positive factors, serve to protect and develop productive forces, and solve the main domestic contradictions. It also decided to adopt the principle of: "It is necessary to properly combine the two aspects of national construction and improvement of people's livelihood, that is, to correctly handle the proportional relationship between accumulation and consumption in the national income," so that the problems of national construction and improvement of people's livelihood can be gradually and properly solved.
2.  From Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation on several issues concerning the proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan, it can be seen that a comprehensive and appropriate arrangement has been made for the coordination and coordination between various sectors of the entire national economy. This guiding principle and prospect are in line with the requirements of the planned and proportional development of the national economy.
3.  The nationwide campaign to increase production and practice economy is rapidly developing, opposing extravagance and waste, advocating a spirit of hard work and simplicity, and implementing the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, which has achieved remarkable results. We know that increasing production and practicing economy is the basic way to build socialism, which has far-reaching significance. At the same time, under the premise of increasing production and practicing economy, existing materials will inevitably be used more rationally, thereby ensuring the necessary needs of production and life.
4.  On the production front, the active actions of workers and peasants responding to the call of the Party Central Committee to increase production and practice economy will inevitably lead to a further upsurge in production. The total industrial output value in 1957 is expected to increase by 6.2% compared with 1956; agricultural and sideline production in 1957 is expected to increase by about 7% compared with 1956, of which the increase in agricultural production is a basic condition for improving people's livelihood.
5.  State-owned commerce and cooperative commerce are further improving commodity circulation work in adapting to the new situation based on summarizing last year's work, vigorously supporting the bumper harvest of agriculture and promoting the development of non-staple food production, doing a good job in market supply, improving the level of business management, striving to reduce costs, expand capital accumulation, and ensure national needs. And with the campaign to increase production and practice economy as the center, they are fully mobilizing and relying on millions of commercial workers to actively work hard for the further advancement of socialist commerce.

With the above major measures, it will inevitably help the comprehensive and further upsurge of the entire national economy, so that our young and strong socialist commerce has obtained the most favorable conditions, providing an infinitely rich material guarantee for actively supporting production and rationally carrying out consumption distribution, and continue to advance for the glorious task of labor production and improving the lives of 600 million people across the country!

Socialist Commercial Workers Undertake a Glorious Task, and Should Sincerely Accept Mass Supervision and Criticism, Improve and Do a Good Job in Commercial Work

Think about it, how rich and colorful are the fruits of the hard work of 600 million people? How huge and complex are their constantly improving and always needed lives? Most of these production and living needs are purchased and distributed through commercial departments, which is such a glorious task. We work between producers and consumers, and must work in accordance with the principle that is beneficial to both parties, especially in the new situation of implementing the joint state-private operation of the entire industry nationwide. Socialist commerce and its workers have an unshirkable responsibility to do a good job in commercial work for the needs of the people across the country; at the same time, we must sincerely accept supervision and criticism from the masses. We can only improve and do our work well under the continuous supervision and criticism of the masses. Chairman Mao instructed that criticism is like people washing their faces every day. Our commercial workers need to wash their faces every day, and they will definitely wipe off the dirty things on their faces and become glorious.

I fully believe that the socialist commercial workers across the country will definitely share the same feelings with me. Inspired by the great achievements of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, with unparalleled soaring socialist enthusiasm, full of confidence, strive to successfully complete the First Five-Year Plan and create favorable conditions for the implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan.

    目前商业工作中的问题和解决办法
    刘昆水谈个人的意见和体会
    我完全同意并拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上的重要讲话，和周恩来总理、陈云副总理、李富春副总理与陈叔通副主席在政协会议上的各项报告，并愿在工作岗位上贯彻执行。
    现在，我仅以一个商业工作者的角度，发表一点意见。
    前进中的社会主义商业已经取得巨大成绩，但也不断发现严重缺点
    在国民经济的恢复和建设期间，我国国营商业和合作社商业，由于党、政府和上级商业机构的正确领导，广大人民群众的监督与支持，以及全体商业工作者的努力，对于扩大和加速商品流转，活跃城乡物资交流，稳定市场物价，满足人民生产和生活的需要，因而巩固了社会主义商业的领导地位，取得了对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的决定性胜利；并不断地学习、总结和推广先进经验，不断地降低流转费用，为国家积累建设资金，以及有计划地组织有关物资的出口，以保证国家建设需要的物资进口，从而促进了工农业生产的不断扩大和迅速发展。在这一时间里，社会主义商业是取得了巨大的成绩和创造了历史性的作用。
    但是商业工作在前进中，也不断发现严重缺点，特别显著的是在1956年的下半年，主要是在商品供应的组织工作、经营管理和服务质量不高等。具体情况不在这里多讲，好在是大家所熟悉的。至于市场供应紧张情况，曾引起部分人民的不满，指责国营和合作社商业部门，甚至埋怨党和政府，特别反应在若干地区的人民代表会议中曾列为重要的议题之一。
    毫无疑问，上述情形的发生，是与商业工作者在贯彻执行党和政府的方针政策、钻研和熟悉客观经济规律的变化与发展、调查研究生产与生活的需要等工作做得不够，以及对社会主义商业在社会主义建设时期的重要性认识不足是分不开的。尤其是对商业工作本身应该克服可以克服的缺点，缺乏急起直追的有效改进精神，增加了某些地区、某些商品的紧张程度。商业工作中的问题
    先进的社会主义制度与落后的社会生产力之间的主要矛盾所产生的问题；国民经济各部门之间矛盾所产生的问题；计划生产和消费分配的问题。
    但是问题也还有另一方面，诚如陈云副总理所指出的：“这是由于1956年社会购买力增长的程度，超过了这些物资增长的程度。”因而给商业工作带来了不能由自身单独克服的困难，我想有分述的必要：
    首先，是先进的社会主义制度与落后的社会生产力之间的主要矛盾所产生的问题。在国内主要矛盾的转化过程中，突出的表现在商业工作上，因为在社会主义的社会制度已经基本建立，人民对于经济文化迅速发展的需要同当前经济文化不能满足需要的矛盾，是由广大人民群众的分散感应，透过商业部门就成为集中的反应。1956年是在社会主义高潮的推动下，是整个国民经济全面高涨的一年，工业总产值比1955年增长27.7％；农业的粮食生产在大灾荒的情况下仍比1955年增加约二百亿斤，足以说明我们国家在生产战线上的进展和增产的成绩是巨大的，是可以满足人民在生产上和生活上的一般需要。但是从人民的经济生活来说，在先进的社会主义制度下面，必然会提出有关生产和生活上的许多要求，而且社会主义制度本身也提出了经济、文化的种种要求，就不能以一般的需要来衡量了。同时，从发展生产力来说，由于资产阶级民主革命和社会主义革命的胜利，已经为发展生产力铺平道路。由于我国的特点是一个落后的农业国，生产力水平还低，特别是占比重还很大的农副业生产，几乎还是手工操作，就使目前农副业生产不能适应日益增长的需要。况且在某些商品上像生猪、植物油等年来还有减产的情况，加上基本建设的扩大，劳动就业的迅速增加，职工工资的较大增长和农民增加了购买力等，就促使某些物资供应呈现暂时的不足和紧张。
    其次，是国民经济各部门之间的矛盾所产生的问题。1956年的国内经济情况是在翻天复地的社会主义改造高潮中，大量的非社会主义的经济成份，迅速地转变为唯一的社会主义经济形式的一年，因此在整个国民经济各部门之间还不能密切联系和配合，若干环节还有缺陷，正如“八大”会议所指出的十大关系需要全面的协调。在没有达到协调之前，所发生的问题也会集中地反应在商业部门。例如工业的布局，农业和手工业合作社的集体利益与个人利益之间的安排，各类经济体制的集中与分散的处理，工农业生产的发展与交通运输的配合等等，如果协调不够，就会呈现出不同程度的问题。特别是在某些部门和某些地区过分强调了基本建设的齐头并进，就带来了建筑材料的空前紧张，大量劳动力的调配和集中，因而使支出的巨额工资提出了大量生活资料的要求，以及相适应的零售商业网的及时设置等等，说明最终表现在商业部门，并且由它暴露在人民群众的面前。
    第三是计划生产和消费分配的问题。只有在社会主义制度下，国民经济计划的正确编制和成为可能才具备了有利条件，才能够按照国民经济有计划的按比例的发展规律进行有节奏的生产和分配。但是我们在目前还不能把所有的生产和分配都纳入计划范围之内，这不仅在生产上有它的自然条件、技术条件等的限制，同时在人民生活方面也随着整个国家的政治、经济和文化的不断高涨，引起了迅速变化。我们回忆前一阶段比较紧张的商品中，除了钢材、煤炭等工业品以外，在农副业产品中都有受自然条件限制和生产不稳定性的特点，例如像牲畜、家禽、蔬菜、水产、中药材等都是如此。同时在人民物质和文化生活方面的需要也有很大的出入。例如去年在全国范围内掀起向科学文化进军的高潮，纸张就显得特别紧张，随之而来的是竹子、碎布等原料的紧张，这样就影响了某些地区的土纸生产和手工业布鞋的原料。土纸不足就加大了以卫生纸代用的范围，又响影到城市人民用卫生纸的习惯。布鞋供应不足扩大了胶鞋、皮鞋的销路，橡胶受一定限制，皮鞋受生猪影响，供应工作就有了问题。又例如去年在四川省卫生部门提出扑灭妇女阴道滴虫病，中药的黄连就成为供不应求的商品。在消灭四害运动中，做火药的土硝就脱销。
    经济生活是与政治和文化生活密切联系在一起，今天，人民的生活既要丰富多彩，又是迅速多变，如果某一商品成为共同要求的焦点，那末要或不要，多要或少要，就成了不可忽视的重大问题。因此在一个六万万人口的国家里，要使生产计划与消费分配能够吻合无间，是需要一段较长的奋斗过程。解决商业中问题的措施
    党和政府正在使国家建设和人民生活改善的问题逐步获得妥善的解决；适当安排国民经济各部门的配合和协调；开展增产节约运动；进一步改进商品流转工作。
    综上所述，说明商业工作虽然是整个国民经济的重要一环，又是人民生产和消费者的有力纽带，但它必然会受到客观的多方面的影响，从而涉及到人民生产和生活。那末这样说来，商业上存在的问题，是不是成为不可克服的呢？我个人的认识是这样：党和政府自从“八大”会议以来，正采取了目前的和长远的各种措施，这些问题已经解决或正在解决，特别是下面几点：
    1、党在“八大”会议的政策精神，就是依靠群众，调动一切积极因素，为保护和发展生产力服务，为解决国内主要矛盾。并决定采取：“必须使国家建设和人民生活改善这两个方面得到适当的结合，也就是使国民收入中积累和消费的比例关系得到正确的处理”的方针，使国家建设和人民生活改善的问题逐步获得妥善的解决。
    2、从李富春副总理关于第二个五年计划建议的若干问题的说明中可以看到：对整个国民经济各部门之间的配合和协调作了全面的适当安排，这一指导原则和前景是符合国民经济有计划按比例发展的要求的。
    3、全国范围内的增产节约运动正在迅速开展，反对铺张浪费，提倡艰苦朴素作风，贯彻勤俭建国的方针，已经收到了显著效果。我们知道，增产节约是建设社会主义的基本道路，有着深远的意义，同时在增加生产，厉行节约的前提下，必然使现有物资利用得更为合理，从而保证了生产和生活的必需需要。
    4、在生产战线上，工人和农民群众正响应党中央号召增产节约运动的积极行动上，必然导致生产的进一步高涨。1957年工业总产值预计比1956年增长6.2％；1957年的农副业生产预计要比1956年增长7％左右，其中农业生产的增长是改善人民生活的基本条件。
    5、国营商业和合作社商业正在总结去年工作的基础上，在适应新的形势下，进一步改进商品流转工作，大力支援农业丰收和促进副食品生产的发展，做好市场供应，提高经营管理水平，努力降低费用，扩大资金积累，保证国家需要。并以增产节约运动为中心，正在充分发动和依靠千百万商业工作者为社会主义商业前进一步积极努力。
    有了上述的重大措施，必然有助于整个国民经济全面的进一步的高涨，使我们年青而壮健的社会主义商业，获得了最有利的条件，为积极地支援生产和合理地进行消费分配提供了无限丰富的物质保证，继续为全国六万万人的劳动生产和改善生活的光荣任务而前进！
    社会主义商业工作者担负着光荣的任务，应该诚恳接受群众监督和批评，改进并做好商业工作
    请想一想，六万万人的辛勤劳动成果该是多么丰富多彩？他们的生活不断改善和时刻需要的又是如何庞大繁杂？这些生产和生活需要绝大部分是通过商业部门进行收购和分配，这是一件多么光荣的任务。我们工作在生产和消费者之间，必须遵照有利于双方的原则进行工作，特别是在全国范围内实行全行业公私合营的新情况下，社会主义商业及其工作者对全国人民的需要做好商业工作是责无旁贷的；同时还要诚恳地接受来自群众的监督和批评，我们只有在群众不断地监督与批评下才能改进和做好工作。毛主席指示过：批评像人要天天洗脸，我们商业工作者需要天天洗脸，一定会把脸上的肮脏东西搽去，成为光彩。
    我充分相信，全国社会主义商业的工作者，一定和我同一心情，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设伟大成就的鼓舞下，和全国人民一道，在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，以无比高涨的社会主义积极性，满怀信心，为圆满地完成第一个五年计划并为执行第二个五年计划创造有利条件而奋斗。
