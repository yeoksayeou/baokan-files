A New Stage in American Expansion in the Middle East
　　Zhang Fang
      "When Britain withdraws, the United States steps in. Wherever Britain is militarily or economically too weak, American power takes over." In an article commenting on the "Eisenhower Doctrine," British Labour Party leader Bevan pointed out that this is a simple "formula" that dominates Western diplomatic strategy, and said that this "formula" will also be applied to the Middle East. This is indeed the case. The "Eisenhower Doctrine" operates according to this "formula," marking a new stage in the exclusion of British and French colonial interests in the Middle East by the United States, marking the beginning of another round in the struggle for spheres of influence among imperialists, and also marking a new aspect of American imperialist-colonialist policy.
      Starting from the "Truman Doctrine"
    British and French imperialism was weakened in World War II, and they could no longer firmly control their colonies and spheres of influence in the Middle East. The United States took the opportunity of participating in World War II to infiltrate the Middle East. At the same time, national independence movements flourished in various Middle Eastern countries, posing an unprecedented threat to British and French colonial rule in the Middle East. Therefore, as soon as the war ended, the United States gradually, comprehensively, and systematically attacked British and French colonies and spheres of influence in the Middle East.
    The United States announced the "Truman Doctrine" in 1947, drawing Turkey and Greece, which had been traditional British spheres of influence, into its embrace. These two countries were eventually dragged into the North Atlantic Group in 1952. Since then, Greece and Turkey, which had always been the gateways of Britain in the Eastern Mediterranean, became vassals of the United States.
    The development of the national independence movement in the Middle East made it impossible for Britain to end its "mandate" in Palestine in 1948. Britain had created ethnic disputes between Jews and Arabs and used this dispute to maintain its rule in Palestine for nearly thirty years. After the end of World War II, this dispute facilitated the United States to seize Britain's position in Palestine. The United States took advantage of the Jewish people's desire to establish a country, making Israel a tool for its expansion in the Middle East from the day it was founded. After the war between Israel and Arab countries from 1948 to 1949, Israel controlled most of Palestine. The United States, as the "mediator" of the Israeli-Arab war, planted its own forces in the heart of the Middle East. Britain attempted to use the feudal monarchs of Arab countries to plan the "Greater Syria Plan" through Jordan in order to preserve its position in the Middle East and salvage its losses in Palestine. However, this plan was not realized. The Tripartite Declaration of Britain, the United States, and France on the Middle East situation in 1950 actually showed that Britain and France were forced to formally recognize the position of the United States in the Middle East. Although Britain still controlled the oil-producing areas of various countries along the Persian Gulf at this time, the balance of power between Britain and the United States in the Middle East began to change in favor of the United States, because the United States had completely controlled the oil production in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, and expanded its forces in Iraq and Kuwait.
    The events that occurred in Iran after the war can be said to have almost replayed the post-war history of Palestine. Iran is the location of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, which is an extremely important base for British colonial rule in the Middle East. Due to the awakening of the Iranian people, the Iranian government announced the nationalization of oil in May 1951; the activities of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, which had cruelly exploited the Iranian people for half a century, were frozen. Britain adopted severe retaliatory measures such as dispatching warships to the Persian Gulf to "demonstrate" and block Iranian oil exports. The Iranian people not only did not yield, but their anti-British national sentiment became even more激昂. The United States appeared as a "mediator" as usual. On the one hand, it supported the blockade of Iranian oil exports, and on the other hand, it provided the Iranian government with financial "aid" through the US Export-Import Bank and the "Fourth Point Plan." US President Truman also sent Averell Harriman, the agent of oil monopoly capital, to Iran as a special envoy, and invited Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh to visit the United States. The US attempt was to try its best to win over the Mosaddegh government, while Britain's entire force was to overthrow this government. Due to the rise and development of the Iranian nationalist movement, the Mosaddegh government did not become a tool of the United States. Therefore, the United States turned around and joined Britain in overthrowing the Mosaddegh government (1953) by intensifying the blockade of Iranian oil exports and a military coup. The new Iranian government fostered by the United States immediately received huge "emergency economic aid" from the United States. Another agent of American oil capital, Herbert Hoover Jr., rushed to Iran as a presidential envoy and concluded an agreement in August 1954 for the "International Consortium" to divide Iranian oil. The "International Consortium" was composed of eight oil companies from Britain, the Netherlands, France, and the United States, and the five US companies accounted for 40% of the shares of the Iranian Oil Company, which created a situation in which the United States shared Iranian oil interests equally with Britain, ending Britain's long-term monopoly position in Iranian oil.
    Although Iran's measure to nationalize its oil property failed, this solemn action to safeguard national sovereignty itself greatly encouraged the development of the national independence movement in the Middle East. The oil-producing countries in the Middle East demanded equal sharing of the income of oil companies controlled by Britain, France, and the Netherlands, which almost became a movement at that time.
    The national independence movement in Egypt also made new progress in this situation. At the request of the Egyptian people, the Egyptian government formally proposed in 1951 to abolish the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, which placed Egypt in a colonial position, and the 1899 agreement on the Anglo-Egyptian condominium (actually a British monopoly) of Sudan. The United States believed that driving British forces out of Egypt was a golden opportunity for the United States. The United States immediately disguised itself as a "friend" of Egypt and the Arabs. Churchill then requested that the United States, France, and Turkey send troops to the Suez region to cooperate with Britain in suppressing the Egyptian people's national movement demanding that Britain withdraw from Egypt, but this was openly rejected by the US government. The United States also acted as a "mediator" in the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations. Dulles and Stassen also went to Cairo to carry out wooing activities during their visit to the Middle East in 1953, which aroused dissatisfaction from the British side. In 1954, Britain and Egypt signed a new Anglo-Egyptian treaty on the gradual withdrawal of Britain from Egypt. The United States regarded these events as its own "contribution" to Egypt and took the opportunity to demand that Egypt participate in the US military treaty system, but this was resolutely rejected by Egypt.
    Israel's acceptance of US control, the sharing of Iranian oil by the United States, and Egypt's abolition of the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty - these three consecutive events shook the foundation of British colonial rule in the Middle East.
    During the same period, France's dominant position in Morocco and Tunisia also faced the threat of national independence movements; France adopted brutal military suppression in these places, causing more intense resistance from the local people. The United States pretended to be a good person from this. In 1954, the UN General Assembly discussed the accusations of Arab and Asian countries against France's violent suppression in North Africa, and the United States deliberately did not stand on the side of France. This aroused an anti-American wave in the French domestic bourgeois newspapers. The United States took advantage of the conflict between France and the North African Arabs to rapidly expand its military bases on France's colonies in North Africa.
        "First aid, then the flag"
    It should be pointed out that an important tool for the United States to squeeze out British and French forces in the Middle East in this period after the war was its foreign "aid" program, including the "Mutual Security Program" and the "Fourth Point Plan." However, the focus of "US aid" at that time was still on Western Europe, followed by the Far East, and the Middle East was still in third place. After 1955, the amount of funding for the Middle East was gradually increased. The recent "Eisenhower Doctrine" announced that it would prepare to allocate an additional 200 million US dollars each year to aid Middle Eastern countries, which reached its peak.
    US aid is the bait for the United States to control Middle Eastern countries. What follows is an attempt to gradually pull Middle Eastern countries into the US military alliance system.
    In 1951, the North Atlantic Treaty Council meeting decided to establish an "Allied Middle East Command" linked to the North Atlantic Treaty. Subsequently, the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey formally issued "invitations" to Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Jordan, requesting them to participate. This plan was actually proposed by the United States, but because the power of Britain and France in the Middle East was still not small at that time, the United States had to let Britain and France be the joint initiators. Britain and France were afraid that the United States would control this group alone, and had to strive to participate. However, due to the firm refusal of Egypt and other Arab countries, this plan eventually went bankrupt.
    By 1953, the United States believed that the Iranian oil incident had actually ended British rule in Iran, and the abolition of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 and the establishment of the Egyptian nationalist government had severely hit Britain's position in Egypt. Based on this situation, the United States independently proposed the Middle East "Northern Tier Plan" (ie, the so-called "Middle East Defense Organization"). Dulles then put forward such a slogan: the "Northern Tier Plan" should be organized by the countries in this region themselves, and large countries outside the region should not participate. This was actually to exclude Britain and France. The United States planned to first pull Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, and Afghanistan into this plan, and then gradually pull in Arab countries as well. Due to the firm opposition of Arab countries and Britain's sabotage, this plan was also declared to have failed. However, the United States still began to partially implement this plan in disguise in 1954. With the wooing of the United States, Turkey and Pakistan signed the "Friendly Cooperation Agreement"; the United States successively signed agreements with Pakistan and Iraq to accept US military assistance. In this way, the United States directly extended its power into Iraq, the strategic stronghold of Britain in the Middle East, and Pakistan, a member of the Commonwealth. This caused great panic in Britain. Therefore, in 1955, Britain actively engaged in activities and established the Baghdad Pact, including Turkey, Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq, with British participation. The United States intentionally stood outside the Baghdad Pact planned by Britain and has refused to participate to this day. However, all the Middle Eastern member states of this treaty have accepted US aid and are subject to US dominance to varying degrees. This treaty is actually inseparable from US control.
    Therefore, in the fierce struggle between Britain and the United States to control Middle Eastern countries through military alliances and squeeze out each other, the United States also gained the upper hand.
    The emergence of the "Eisenhower Doctrine"
    In 1956, the national independence movement in the Middle East was unprecedentedly high. In that year, after forcing Britain to withdraw its troops stationed in Egypt in accordance with the 1954 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, Egypt then took back the Suez Canal Company and defeated the armed invasion of the British and French allied forces. The power of Britain and France in the Middle East was greatly weakened. The United States implemented a two-pronged policy during the Egyptian war, on the one hand, condoning the aggression of Britain and France, and on the other hand, waiting for Britain and France to be weakened in armed intervention, while taking an attitude of detachment to seek political capital for itself. After the failure of the British and French invasion of Egypt, the United States believed that this was the time for it to "enter the house" in the Middle East, and thus proposed a "new" policy towards the Middle East - the "Eisenhower Doctrine." In fact, this is not a "new" policy, but a continuation of the policy that the United States has always pursued since the war to replace Britain and France. The difference is that this time the scale is larger: it wants to completely overthrow the rule of Britain and France in the Middle East and monopolize it, rather than seize individual colonies or spheres of influence.
      Dulles himself admitted to this plan of the "Eisenhower Doctrine." In a secret memorandum he submitted to Eisenhower (as revealed by the "Neues Deutschland"), he pointed out that on the one hand, the failure of Britain and France has created a certain "vacuum" here (in the Middle East), and Britain and France will never be able to cope with this situation in this region; on the other hand, Egypt and the Arab countries are beginning to understand that they can decide their own affairs, and they are trying to get rid of the Western guardianship they hate. Therefore, Dulles believes that the United States must take necessary measures to fill the "vacuum" formed in the Middle East. This measure is the "Eisenhower Doctrine," which will encompass the Near East and North Africa within the scope of American "strategic responsibility," so that the United States can take corresponding measures in this region without consulting with Britain and France.
    What are the main areas of American "responsibility"? According to the American magazine "Monthly Review," they are mainly "the two most prosperous economic regions: the oil fields around the Persian Gulf and the vast resources of the vast Middle Africa and North Africa, including the Nile, uranium mines, other treasures in the Congo and nearby areas, and the resources of the largely unexplored Sahara and Northwest Africa."
    From here, it is not difficult to understand what the purpose of US Vice President Nixon and US Presidential Envoy Richards' extensive activities in North Africa and the Near East at the same time as the "Eisenhower Doctrine" was launched.
    And people know that the oil fields around the Persian Gulf are the last and most important base of British colonial interests in the Middle East; and Central Africa and North Africa are also the remaining spheres of influence of Britain and France. Therefore, the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is actually to uproot the last colonial strongholds of Britain and France in the Middle East, and establish an American colonial empire in the place where Britain and France have fallen.
    Naturally, the rulers of the United States have realized that it is difficult to establish an American colonial empire in the Middle East, which has awakened and is rising up to fight back against Western colonialism. Therefore, the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is covered with the most cunning disguise. First, it is baited with huge military "aid" and economic "aid." On the surface, it is not like Britain and France who are only here to exploit, but to "send money to your door." Second, it uses the pretext of opposing communism, guaranteeing the "security" of the Middle East, and maintaining the "independence" of Middle Eastern countries, and does not take naked military suppression actions like Britain and France; third, it is more cunning than Britain and France in creating and using the contradictions between Middle Eastern countries and between various ethnic groups, and tries its best to cover up its own colonialist intentions, unlike Britain and France who nakedly expose their identities as colonizers. However, the recent announcement by the United States at the Bermuda Conference to participate in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee has exposed its true face of wholeheartedly suppressing the Middle East national movement.
      The planners of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" have taken great pains to embellish this expansion plan of the United States. On the one hand, it is to deceive the people of various Middle Eastern countries, but at the same time, it is also to block the mouths of British and French colonialists, so that they cannot oppose it. Britain and France have just failed in their invasion of the Middle East, and they have to sigh that they are not as good as others, and watch the United States fill the "vacuum" they left there. This is entirely out of necessity. But it would be too naive to think that Britain and France have handed over their colonial rule in the Middle East to the United States. British and French colonialists are bound to strive to defend their colonial interests. Therefore, with the gradual implementation of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," that is, with the further intrusion of American forces into the Middle East, the contradictions between American colonialists and British and French colonialists will inevitably become increasingly acute. At the same time, since this aggressive plan of the United States is completely incompatible with the national interests of the Middle Eastern people, even if it may still be able to deceive a small number of people by relying on some disguises, the Middle Eastern people will never tolerate the new colonialist plan of the United States. As Egyptian public opinion stated earlier, the Middle Eastern people drove out the British and French colonialists, not to let the American colonialists in. As Bevan of the British Labour Party said: "The US dollar may come in larger amounts than the pound sterling, but once it is tainted with the suspicion of imperialist penetration, the US dollar may not be more popular than the pound sterling."

　　美国对中东扩张的新阶段
　　张放
      “当英国退出的时候，美国就走进去。任何地方只要英国在军事上或经济上过于软弱，美国的势力就把它接受了过去。”英国工党领袖比万在评论“艾森豪威尔主义”的一篇文章中指出这是支配西方外交策略的一个简单的“公式”，并且说这个“公式”也将应用到中东了。事实确是如此。“艾森豪威尔主义”便是按这个“公式”办事的，它标志着美国排斥英法在中东的殖民利益的新阶段，标志着帝国主义争夺势力范围的斗争又一个回合的开始，同时也标志着美国帝国主义—殖民主义政策的一个新的方面。
      从“杜鲁门主义”开始
    英法帝国主义在第二次大战中削弱了，它们已经不能牢固地控制它们在中东的殖民地和势力范围。美国则借着参加第二次大战的机会渗入了中东。同时，中东各国蓬蓬勃勃地兴起了民族独立运动，使英、法在中东的殖民统治面临着前所未有的威胁。所以当战争一结束，美国就逐渐地、全面地、有计划地向英法在中东的殖民地和势力范围进攻。
    美国在1947年宣布“杜鲁门主义”，把作为英国的传统的势力范围的土耳其和希腊两国拉入了自己的怀抱。这两个国家最后在1952年被拖进了北大西洋集团。从此，一向作为英国在东地中海门户的希、土两国便成了美国的附庸。
    中东的民族独立运动的发展使得英国不能不在1948年结束它在巴勒斯坦的“委任统治”。英国曾经制造了犹太人和阿拉伯人的民族纠纷，并利用这种纠纷在巴勒斯坦维持了将近三十年的统治。第二次世界大战结束以后，这个纠纷却便利了美国来夺取英国在巴勒斯坦的地位。美国利用了犹太人的建国的愿望，使以色列从建国之日起便成为它在中东进行扩张的工具。经过1948年到1949年以色列同阿拉伯国家之间的战争后，以色列控制了巴勒斯坦的大部分地区。美国以以阿战争“调停人”的身份把自己的势力在中东地区的腹部树植起来了。英国企图利用阿拉伯国家的封建王公，通过约旦策划“大叙利亚计划”来保全自己在中东的地位，和挽救自己在巴勒斯坦的损失。但是这个计划没有得到实现。1950年英美法关于中东局势的三国宣言，实际上是表明英法被迫正式承认了美国在中东的地位。虽然英国这时在中东还控制着波斯湾沿岸地区的各国石油产地，但是由于美国已经完全控制了沙特阿拉伯和巴林岛的石油生产，并且在伊拉克和科威特扩张了自己的势力，因而英美在中东地区力量对比已开始发生有利于美国的变化。
    伊朗战后发生的事变，可以说是几乎重演了巴勒斯坦战后的历史。伊朗是英伊石油公司的所在地，它是英国在中东的一个极其重要的殖民统治的基地。由于伊朗人民的觉醒，伊朗政府在1951年5月宣布了石油国有化的命令；对伊朗人民进行了半世纪残酷剥削的英伊石油公司的活动，被冻结了。英国采取了派遣兵舰到波斯湾“示威”以及封锁伊朗石油输出等严厉的报复措施。伊朗人民不但没有屈服，而且反英的民族情绪更加激昂。美国照例以“调停人”的面目出现，它一方面支持对伊朗石油输出的封锁措施，另一方面则通过美国进出口银行和“第四点计划”给予伊朗政府以财政上的“援助”。美国总统杜鲁门还派遣石油垄断资本的代理人哈里曼为特使到伊朗活动，并且邀请伊朗首相摩萨台访问美国。美国的企图是要竭力拉拢摩萨台政府，而当时英国的全部力量正是要推翻这个政府。由于伊朗民族主义运动的高涨和发展，摩萨台政府没有变为美国的工具，于是美国转过来同英国在一起通过加紧对伊朗石油输出的封锁和军事政变的办法推翻了摩萨台政府（1953年）。由美国扶植起来的伊朗新政府，马上得到美国巨额的“紧急经济援助”。另一个美国石油资本的代理人小胡佛又以总统特使的身份赶到伊朗进行活动，在1954年8月缔结了由“国际财团”瓜分伊朗石油的协议。“国际财团”是由英、荷、法、美四国的八家石油公司组成的，而其中美国的五家公司占有了伊朗石油公司股份的40％，这就造成了美国在伊朗石油利益中同英国平分秋色的局面，结束了英国对伊朗石油的长期的独占的地位。
    伊朗把石油财产国有化的措施虽然遭到了失败，但这一维护国家主权的庄严行动本身却大大鼓励了中东民族独立运动的发展。中东出产石油的国家要求对等地平分在英、法、荷控制下的石油公司的收入，当时几乎形成为一种运动。
    埃及的民族独立运动在这种形势下也有了新的发展。埃及政府在埃及人民的要求下在1951年正式提出废止1936年把埃及置于殖民地地位的英埃条约，以及1899年关于英埃共管（实际上是英国独占）苏丹的协定。美国认为从埃及赶走英国的势力，是美国千载一时的好机会。美国立即把自己装扮成埃及和阿拉伯人的“朋友”。丘吉尔当时曾要求美、法、土派兵到苏伊士地区协同英国镇压埃及人民要求英国撤出埃及的民族运动，却为美国政府所公开拒绝。美国并且在英埃谈判中间以“调停人”自居。杜勒斯和史塔生并且在1953年在访问中东的旅途中到了开罗进行拉拢活动，这曾引起英国方面的不满。1954年，英埃签订了关于规定英国从埃及逐步撤退的英埃新条约。美国把这些事件看作为自己对埃及的“贡献”，并且乘机要求埃及参加美国的军事条约体系，但是遭到埃及的断然拒绝。
    以色列接受美国的控制，伊朗石油被美国分享，埃及废除1936年英埃条约——这三件连续发生的事件，动摇了英国在中东的殖民统治的基础。
    在这同一时期，法国在摩洛哥、突尼斯的统治地位也面临民族独立运动的威胁；法国对这些地方采取残酷的军事镇压，引起了当地人民更加剧烈的反抗。美国却从中假装好人。1954年联大讨论阿拉伯和亚洲国家对法国在北非的暴力镇压的控诉案，美国故意不同法国站在一边。这引起了法国国内资产阶级报纸的反美的浪潮。美国利用法国同北非阿拉伯人之间的冲突，迅速地在北非法国的殖民地上扩充了自己的军事基地。
        “先援助然后军旗”
    应当指出，美国战后这一时期在中东排挤英法势力的一个重要工具，就是它的对外“援助”计划，包括“共同安全计划”和“第四点计划”。但是当时“美援”的重点还是放在西欧，其次是远东，中东还是第三位。1955年以后，逐渐提高了对中东的拨款比额。最近“艾森豪威尔主义”宣布准备每年额外拨款二亿美元来援助中东国家，则达到了最高峰。
    美援是美国控制中东国家的钓饵。随之而来的便是企图把中东国家逐步拉进美国的军事同盟系统。
    1951年，北大西洋公约理事会会议决定成立同北大西洋公约有联系的“盟国中东司令部”。接着，便由美、英、法、土正式向埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、伊拉克、沙特阿拉伯、也门和约旦提出“邀请”，要求它们参加。这个计划事实上是美国提出的，但因为当时英法在中东的势力还不小，因此美国不得不让英法做共同的发起人。英法怕美国独自控制这个集团，也不得不争取参加。但是由于埃及和其他阿拉伯国家坚决拒绝，这个计划最后破产了。
    到1953年，美国认为伊朗石油事件实际上已经结束英国在伊朗的统治地位，而英埃1936年条约的废除和埃及民族主义政府的成立又严重地打击了英国在埃及的地位。根据这种情况，美国便单独提出中东“北层计划”（即所谓“中东防御组织”）。杜勒斯当时提出这样的口号：“北层计划”应由这个地区的国家自己组织，地区以外的大国不应参加。这实际上是要排斥英法。美国打算首先把土耳其、伊朗、伊拉克、巴基斯坦、阿富汗拉进这个计划，然后逐渐把阿拉伯国家也拉进来。由于阿拉伯国家的坚决反对和英国的从中破坏，这个计划也宣布流产了。但是，美国还是在1954年开始部分地变相地实现了这个计划。在美国的拉拢下，土耳其和巴基斯坦签订了“友好合作协定”；美国先后同巴基斯坦、伊拉克签订了接受美国军事援助的协定。这样，美国便把自己的势力直接伸入英国在中东的战略据点伊拉克和英联邦成员国巴基斯坦。这引起英国极大的惊慌。所以在1955年，英国便积极活动，建立了有英国参加的包括土耳其、巴基斯坦、伊朗、伊拉克在内的巴格达条约。美国却有意站在英国策划的巴格达条约以外，至今拒绝参加。但是这个条约所有的中东成员国家都接受了美援，在不同程度上受到美国的支配，这个条约事实上也脱离不了美国的控制。
    因此英美在利用事军同盟来控制中东国家并排挤对方的剧烈的斗争中，美国也是占了上风。
    “艾森豪威尔主义”的出笼
    1956年，中东的民族独立运动空前高涨。埃及这一年在迫使英国根据1954英埃条约撤退英国在埃及的驻军以后，接着收回了苏伊士运河公司，并且击败了英法联军的武装侵略。英法在中东的势力大大削弱。而美国在埃及战争期间实行两面政策，一方面纵容英法的侵略，另一方面又等待英法在武装干涉中被削弱，同时以置身事外的姿态来为自己谋取政治资本。在英法侵埃失败以后，美国就认为这是它向中东地区“登堂入室”的时机了，于是提出了对中东的“新”政策——“艾森豪威尔主义”。其实，这并不是什么“新”政策，而是战后以来，美国一向奉行的取代英法地位的政策的继续。不同的是，这次的规模更大了：它要全盘推翻英法在中东的统治，由自己来独占，而不是夺取个别的殖民地或势力范围。
      “艾森豪威尔主义”的这种打算，杜勒斯自己也承认。他在他提交给艾森豪威尔的一份秘密备忘录（据“新德意志报”揭露）曾经指出，一方面由于英法的失败在这里（中东）产生了一定的“真空现象”，而英法绝不可能在这一地区应付这种局势；另一方面埃及和阿拉伯国家开始了解它们能够自己决定自己的事务，它们正在力图摆脱它们所憎恨的西方的监护。因此，杜勒斯认为美国必须采取必要的措施来填补在中东所形成的“真空”。这种措施便是
  “艾森豪威尔主义”，它将使近东和北非被圈在美国的“战略责任”的范围内，这样可以使美国不要同英法商量就在这一地区采取相应的措施。
    美国的“责任范围”主要是那些地方呢？据美国“每月评论”杂志揭露，主要是“两个最富庶的经济地区：波斯湾周围的油田和包括尼罗河在内的广大的中非、北非地区的丰富的资源、铀矿，刚果及附近地区的其他宝藏，还有基本上是未经勘探的撒哈拉和非洲西北部的资源”。
    从这里，人们不难理解，当“艾森豪威尔主义”出笼的同时，美国副总统尼克松和美国总统特使理查兹分别在北非和中近东从事广泛的活动的目的是为了什么了。
    而人们知道，波斯湾周围的油田正是英国在中东殖民利益的最后的也是最主要的基地；而中非、北非也是英、法的残存的势力范围。所以“艾森豪威尔主义”实际上就是要把英法在中东的最后殖民据点连根拔除，而在英法倒下去的地方建立起美国的殖民帝国。
    自然，美国的统治者已经察觉到，要在已经觉醒并正在奋起反击西方殖民主义的中东地区建立美国的殖民帝国是困难重重的。因此，“艾森豪威尔主义”就披上了最狡猾的伪装。第一，它是以巨额军事“援助”和经济“援助”为钓饵的，从表面上看来，它不是像英法那样只是来进行压榨剥削，而却是来“送钱上门”的。第二，它以反对共产主义、保证中东的“安全”、维护中东国家“独立”做幌子，不是像英法那样赤裸裸地采取军事镇压的行动；第三，它比英法更加奸诈地制造和利用中东各国之间、各民族之间的矛盾，极力掩盖自己的殖民主义目的，不像英法露骨地暴露出自己的殖民者的面目。但是美国最近在百慕大会谈中宣布参加巴格达条约军事委员会，却把自己一心要镇压中东民族运动的真面目暴露了出来。
      “艾森豪威尔主义”的策划者们煞费苦心来给美国的这个扩张计划涂脂抹粉，一方面固然是为了想要欺骗中东各国的人民，但同时也是要堵住英法殖民者的嘴巴，使他们无法反对。英法两国刚刚在中东侵略失败，只好自叹不如，眼看着美国在那里去填补它们留下的“真空”。这完全是出于不得已。但是如果认为英国和法国就这样把自己在中东的殖民统治地位拱手让给了美国，那就未免太天真了。英国和法国殖民者势必努力去保卫自己的殖民利益。因此随着“艾森豪威尔主义”的逐步推行，也就是说，随着美国势力对中东地区的进一步侵入，美国殖民者和英法殖民者之间的矛盾必然会日益尖锐起来。同时，由于美国这一侵略性的计划是同中东人民的民族利益毫不相容的，因此即使它目前还可能依靠一些伪装来欺骗某一小部分人，但是终究中东人民是决不会容忍美国的新殖民主义计划的。正如埃及的舆论早些时候所严正指出的：中东人民把英法殖民者赶出去，并不是为了让美国殖民者进来的。也正如英国工党的比万所说的：“美元比英镑来得多些，但是一旦沾上了帝国主义渗入的嫌疑，美元就不一定比英镑更得人心。”
