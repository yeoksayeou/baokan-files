Welcoming Distinguished Guests from Fraternal Czechoslovakia
Chairman Zhou Enlai's Speech at the CPPCC National Committee

Respected Comrade Premier, Comrades and Friends!

The Third Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has been in session for several days. Today, we feel particularly honored that our distinguished guests, representatives of the fraternal Czechoslovak people, Comrade Viliam Široký, Premier of the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic, and all the comrades of the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic, have come to meet with all the comrades attending this session. First of all, please allow me to extend a warm welcome and fraternal respect to the distinguished guests who have come from afar.

Premier Široký is an outstanding political activist of Czechoslovakia and one of the leaders of the glorious Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. Since his youth, Premier Široký has actively participated in the Czechoslovak workers' movement and waged a resolute and heroic struggle for the freedom and liberation of his country. After the liberation of Czechoslovakia, Premier Široký made outstanding efforts to defend the victorious achievements of the Czechoslovak people, to consolidate the socialist system of Czechoslovakia, and to develop the cause of socialist construction.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the government of Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak people have made brilliant achievements in the cause of socialist construction. Today, Czechoslovakia is a highly industrialized socialist country. The rapid development of its national economy and the continuous improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards powerfully demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system. In international affairs, Czechoslovakia is playing an increasingly important role, making important contributions to strengthening the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and safeguarding peace in Europe and the world.

Although China and Czechoslovakia are geographically far apart, and the historical conditions of our two peoples are different, both of our peoples have long waged struggles for national independence and liberation under the leadership of the Communist Party. In the struggle, our two peoples have given each other deep concern and sympathy. After our two peoples were liberated and established their own countries, the traditional friendship between us has developed even greater. Our two countries have increasingly broad cooperation in political, economic, and cultural fields. Due to historical reasons, China is economically backward. In the past few years, in our economic construction, we have received much great assistance from the Czechoslovak people. Here, please allow me to once again express my heartfelt thanks on behalf of the Chinese people to the fraternal Czechoslovak people.

This meeting will conduct a wide-ranging discussion on various important issues in our country's political, economic, and cultural construction. Past facts have proven that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as a broad people's democratic united front organization of various democratic parties, people's organizations, and non-party人士 in our country, has played a very important role in mobilizing and uniting the people of the whole country to carry out socialist construction and to oppose enemies at home and abroad. In the future, we must continue to strengthen our work in this regard. We all know that Czechoslovakia also has an organization of a united front led by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and composed of various democratic parties and people's organizations—the National Front. The National Front has done a lot of work and achieved great success in cooperating with the Communist Party and the government of Czechoslovakia in uniting the people of the whole country to carry out socialist construction and support the government's foreign policy of peace. The delegation headed by Premier Široký includes the heads of many departments of the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic. Some of them are leaders of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and some are leaders of other democratic parties. Among those present today are representatives of the Czechoslovak National Front: Comrade Šlechta, Chairman of the Czechoslovak Socialist Party and Chairman of the State Construction Committee; Comrade Plojhara, Chairman of the Czechoslovak People's Party and Minister of Health; and Comrade Kyselý, Chairman of the Slovak Revival Party and Minister of Local Economy. We are very happy to have the opportunity to meet with them.

Now, let us invite Premier Široký to speak to us.

    欢迎兄弟的捷克斯洛伐克贵宾
    周恩来主席在政协全国委员会上的致词敬爱的总理同志，同志们、朋友们！
    中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第三次全体会议已经开过几天了。今天，我们感到特别荣幸的是我们的贵宾、兄弟的捷克斯洛伐克人民的代表、捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府总理威廉·西罗基同志和捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团的全体同志们前来和我们出席这次会议的全体同志会见。首先，请允许我向远道而来的贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎和兄弟的敬意。
    西罗基总理是捷克斯洛伐克杰出的政治活动家，是光荣的捷克斯洛伐克共产党领导人之一。从青年时代起，西罗基总理就积极地参加了捷克斯洛伐克的工人运动，为争取自己祖国的自由和解放进行了坚决的、英勇的斗争。捷克斯洛伐克解放以后，西罗基总理为捍卫捷克斯洛伐克人民的胜利成果，为巩固捷克斯洛伐克的社会主义制度和发展社会主义建设事业进行了卓越的努力。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民在捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府的领导下，在社会主义建设事业中已经取得了光辉的成就。今天捷克斯洛伐克已经是一个工业高度发达的社会主义国家。它的国民经济的迅速发展和人民物质文化生活水平的不断提高，有力地显示出社会主义制度的优越性。在国际事务中，捷克斯洛伐克日益起着重要的作用，它为加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结和保卫欧洲和世界的和平作出了重要的贡献。
    中国和捷克斯洛伐克虽然在地理上相隔很远，我们两国人民所处的历史条件也不一样。但是，我们两国人民都是在共产党的领导下，长期地进行了争取民族独立和解放的斗争。在斗争中，我们两国人民曾经互相寄与深切的关怀和同情。当我们两国人民获得了解放并且建立了自己的国家以后，我们之间的传统友谊有了更大的发展。我们两国在政治、经济、文化各方面都有着日益广泛的合作。由于历史的原因，我们中国在经济上是落后的。几年来在我国的经济建设中，我们得到捷克斯洛伐克人民的许多巨大的援助。在这里，请允许我再一次代表中国人民向兄弟的捷克斯洛伐克人民表示衷心的感谢。
    我们这次会议将对我国的政治、经济和文化建设中的各种重要问题进行广泛的讨论。过去的事实证明，中国人民政治协商会议作为我国各民主党派、各人民团体和无党派人士的广泛的人民民主统一战线组织，在动员和团结全国人民进行社会主义建设和反对国内外敌人的斗争中起着十分重要的作用。今后我们还要继续加强我们在这方面的工作。我们大家都知道，捷克斯洛伐克同样有着以捷克斯洛伐克共产党为领导的由各民主党派、各人民团体所组成的统一战线的组织——民族阵线。民族阵线在配合捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府团结全国人民进行社会主义建设和支持政府的和平外交政策中做了许多工作，并且取得了很大的成就。这次以西罗基总理为首的代表团包括捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府许多部门的负责人。他们之中有些是捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导人，有些是其他民主党派的领导人。今天在座的，就有捷克斯洛伐克民族阵线的代表人物：捷克斯洛伐克社会党主席、国家建设委员会主席斯列赫塔同志，捷克斯洛伐克人民党主席、卫生部长普洛伊哈同志，斯洛伐克复兴党主席、地方经济部长基塞利同志。我们有机会和他们会见，感到十分高兴。
    现在，我们请西罗基总理给我们讲话。
