Xinhua News Agency, Accra, 6th - Our reporter Peng Di reports: A new independent nation in West Africa, Ghana, was born today.

The British flag of the Gold Coast was lowered for the last time at midnight on the 5th. Then, at just past midnight, the red, gold, and green flag with a black star of Africa in the center was raised, marking the birth of the new nation of Ghana.

Tens of thousands of Africans watched this ceremony, illuminated and decorated in a riot of colors, in the center of Accra, cheering, singing, drumming, and dancing.

Hundreds of thousands more participated in similar ceremonies held simultaneously in Kumasi, Tamale, Hohoe, Cape Coast, and other cities across the country.

Representatives from approximately sixty nations, including China, the Soviet Union, India, and many other Asian and African countries, attended the grand ceremony, sharing the joy of the black people of Africa in winning independence.

Immediately after delivering his policy speech at the final session of the Gold Coast Parliament, Gold Coast Prime Minister Nkrumah came out to celebrate with the people. He was immediately lifted onto the shoulders of the enthusiastic crowd and carried to the square near the parliament building, where he delivered a short but moving speech to an audience of around forty thousand extremely excited listeners. He said that from now on, "we are no longer a colonial country, but a free and independent people." He repeatedly shouted "Ghana is free forever" and sang Ghana's new national anthem with the people of Ghana for the first time.

It was a sleepless night in Accra. The city center was constantly filled with crowds of men, women, and children, dressed in colorful national costumes, parading, singing, and dancing to the beat of tribal drums. The sounds of fireworks and firecrackers continued until dawn.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Accra, 6th - Gold Coast (Ghana) Prime Minister Nkrumah announced Ghana's policies at a special session of Parliament at midnight on the 5th.

He said: Ghana after independence will remain within the British Commonwealth. However, he emphasized that this new relationship with the Commonwealth should be based on "absolute equality and friendship."

Nkrumah said: "Our foreign policy will be based on the three words: dignity, peace, and friendship." He said: "The government of Ghana believes that at this stage, the country should not assume obligations in any aspect of its foreign policy and should not participate in any national or political blocs. The government of Ghana does not intend to adopt a neutral policy in foreign relations, but it does intend to maintain its independence and take the action that seems most appropriate at any time."

"The government hopes that Ghana will become a member of the United Nations as soon as possible."

He said that the Ghanaian government will be concerned with the economic and social progress of the Ghanaian people.

"The government of Ghana will strive to ensure that all African people benefit and progress in the pursuit of freedom and social advancement."

He also expressed the hope that, in cooperation with all other African countries, Ghana and other African countries will be able to adopt a common attitude towards local and world issues, so as to ensure that issues related to Africa receive the attention that has long been lacking. He said: "Our aim is to work with other countries to establish an African identity in international affairs."

Nkrumah also said that, as Prime Minister, he intends to concurrently hold the posts of Minister of Defense and Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Nkrumah also spoke about the economic aspects of Ghana's policies. He said: "Ghana's foreign policy will not be limited by Ghana's need to obtain assistance from other countries." He also pointed out that Ghana is the world's largest producer of gold and cocoa, and the fourth largest producer of manganese, so it does not need to rely on foreign capital in any way. He said that the Gold Coast had not extensively utilized British colonial aid in the past, but on the contrary, had made a significant contribution to the net dollar income of British colonial territories. Therefore, Ghana "does not intend to seek to continue any assistance from the wealthier members of the Commonwealth on a granting basis," but in some cases, "Ghana's development funds can be borne by Commonwealth countries on an equal and mutually beneficial basis."

He concluded by saying that Ghana has won its freedom and will now triumph in the "second battle for economic independence and social reconstruction."

Nkrumah's Biography:

Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, Prime Minister of Ghana, is forty-eight years old. He was born into a poor family of the Twi tribe in the Gold Coast. From 1935 to 1947, he studied in the United States and Britain with the financial assistance of relatives and friends, earning Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. During his studies abroad, he engaged in the movement for national independence. After returning to his country, he continued to engage in political activities. In June 1949, he organized the People's Convention Party, and he was elected as the party's lifelong chairman. He was arrested twice, in 1948 and 1950, for fighting for the independence and freedom of the Gold Coast. In February 1951, the Gold Coast held its first general election, and the People's Convention Party won. The British colonial authorities had to release Nkrumah. In March 1952, Nkrumah became Prime Minister. General elections were held twice in June 1954 and July 1956, and the People's Convention Party still won. Nkrumah was re-elected as Prime Minister. After the Gold Coast became independent, it changed its name to Ghana, and Nkrumah served as Prime Minister of Ghana.

    加纳总理恩克鲁玛博士，现年四十八岁。他出身于黄金海岸特威族的一个贫穷的家庭里。从1935年到1947年，他得亲友的资助，曾先后到美国和英国留学，取得了文学学士、神学学士和哲学博士的学位。他在留学期间，就从事争取民族独立的运动。回国后继续进行政治活动，1949年6月组织人民大会党，他被选为党的终身主席。他因争取黄金海岸的独立自由，曾在1948年和1950年两次被捕。1951年2月，黄金海岸举行第一次大选，人民大会党获得胜利，英国殖民当局不得不释放恩克鲁玛。1952年3月，恩克鲁玛担任总理。1954年6月和1956年7月举行过两次大选，人民大会党仍获胜利，恩克鲁玛连任总理。黄金海岸独立后改国名为加纳，恩克鲁玛任加纳总理。
    新华社阿克拉6日电　本社记者彭迪报道：西非的一个新的独立国家——加纳今天诞生了。
    黄金海岸的英国国旗5日午夜最后一次地降了下来，接着，正当中有一颗非洲的黑北极星的红、金、绿三色国旗在刚过午夜的时分升了起来，标志着新国家加纳的诞生。
    成千上万的非洲人在这个照耀通明和装饰得五色缤纷的阿克拉市中心观看这次典礼，他们欢呼，歌唱，敲鼓和跳舞。
    还有成千上万的人参加了同时在库马西，塔马利，霍城，海岸角和全国其他各城市举行的同样的典礼。
    大约六十个国家的代表，其中包括中国、苏联、印度和其他许多亚非国家的代表都出席观看了这个盛大的典礼，分享了非洲黑种人民在赢得独立时的欢乐。
    黄金海岸总理恩克鲁玛在黄金海岸议会的最后一次会议上发表了他的政策演说后立即出来同人民一起庆祝，他刚一出来就被热情的群众抬在肩上，拥到议会附近的广场上，他在那里对四万名左右非常兴奋的听众发表了一篇简短而激动人心的演说。他说，从现在起，“我们不再是殖民地国家，而是自由和独立的人民了。”他一再高呼“加纳是永远自由了”，并且同加纳人民一起第一次唱了加纳的新国歌。
    这是阿克拉的一个不眠之夜。市中心始终有人山人海的男女老幼，他们穿着五光十色的民族服装，游行、歌唱和随着部族鼓声的节拍跳舞，烟火和爆竹的声音一直响到天亮。
    据新华社阿克拉6日电　黄金海岸（加纳）总理恩克鲁玛，5日午夜在议会的一次特别会议上宣布了加纳的政策。
    他说：独立后的加纳将留在英联邦以内。但是，他着重地指出，同英联邦的这种新关系应该建立在“绝对平等和友好”的基础上。
    恩克鲁玛说：“我们的外交政策将以尊严、和平、友好这三个字为基础。”他说：“加纳政府认为，在目前这个阶段，国家在它的外交政策的任何方面都不应该承担义务，并且不应该参加任何国家集团或者政治集团。加纳政府在对外关系上并不打算采取中立政策，但是它的确打算维护它的独立，在任何时候都采取看来是最适当的行动。”
    “政府希望加纳能尽快地成为联合国的会员国。”
    他说，加纳政府将关心加纳人民在经济和社会方面的进步。
    “加纳政府将努力使全体非洲人民在追求自由和社会进步的过程中获得利益和进展。”
    他还表示，希望在同所有其他非洲国家合作的情况下，加纳和非洲其他国家将能够对当地问题和世界问题采取共同的态度，这样就能保证，和非洲有关的问题将受到长久以来一直没有受到过的那种注意。他说：“我们的目的是和其他国家共同努力在国际事务中树立非洲的个性。”
    恩克鲁玛还说，作为总理，他打算兼任国防部长和外交部长。
    恩克鲁玛还谈到加纳政策的经济方面。他说：“加纳的外交政策将不受加纳要从其他国家获得援助的需要所限制。”他并且指出，加纳是世界上最大的黄金和可可出产国，锰的生产占世界第四位，因此它无论如何不必依赖外国资本。他说，黄金海岸过去并没有大规模地利用英国的殖民援助，而相反地对英国殖民地领土的净美元收入有很大贡献。因此，加纳“不打算设法使来自英联邦较富的成员国的建筑在赐与的基础上的任何援助继续下去”，但是在某种情况下，“加纳的发展经费可以在平等和互利的基础上由英联邦国家负担。”
    他最后谈到，加纳已经赢得了自由，现在它将要在“经济独立与社会重建的第二次战斗”中取得胜利。
