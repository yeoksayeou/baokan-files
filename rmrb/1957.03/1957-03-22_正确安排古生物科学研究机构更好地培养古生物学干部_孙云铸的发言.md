I fully endorse Chairman Mao's speech on the issue of contradictions among the people under the socialist system at the Supreme State Conference, as well as the reports from the leading comrades.

I am a paleontology and stratigraphy worker, as well as a geological education worker. Now, in connection with our work, I would like to offer some immature opinions on the following two issues:

(1) Paleontological research institutions. Whether it is the Institute of Paleontology of the Academy of Sciences, the Stratigraphy Research Office of the Institute of Geology, the Paleontology and Stratigraphy Office and Spore and Pollen Research Office of the Institute of Mineral Resources of the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, and the corresponding units in other production departments, the main task at present is to serve geology, solve a series of stratigraphic division and correlation problems, and on the one hand, to identify more useful mineral deposits in a relatively short period of time, while also ensuring the quality of national regional geological surveying work; on the other hand, to conduct research on basic theoretical issues of paleontology and stratigraphy from the disciplines of stratigraphy and paleontology themselves, so as to reach or approach the international level within twelve years.

Therefore, paleontological workers in the Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Geology, and institutions of higher learning should, on the one hand, vigorously cultivate expertise according to categories (such as foraminifera, ammonites, etc.) and eras (Carboniferous, Triassic, etc.), and on the other hand, equip some paleontological personnel to participate in comprehensive investigation work in key mining areas and regional geological surveys, so that they can become regional geological workers. Both aspects must be taken into account, and neither aspect should be unilaterally emphasized.

Regarding paleontological research in various institutions, the main tasks are consistent. That is, the Academy of Sciences should do more basic theoretical research, while also integrating with production; the Ministry of Geology and other operational departments should undertake more production tasks, while also conducting some scientific theoretical research.

Therefore, the direction of paleontological and stratigraphic research institutions is somewhat different from other engineering professions. It does not lie in a complete consolidation, but in reasonable consultation and division of labor, unity and cooperation. More importantly, it should be handled in conjunction with the development and characteristics of each unit. Scientific research work should be launched as soon as possible, while also making some individual adjustments. Blindly merging and abolishing should not be done. However, this does not mean that new institutions established in some operational departments without any conditions must be preserved.

Our division of labor in geological paleontology work is a division of labor for project research under a large central issue, a division of leadership, a division of research areas, a division from the publication of publications, a division in the training of professional cadres, and mutual assistance in library equipment. Recently, various domestic paleontological research institutions and almost every paleontological and stratigraphic worker have been willing to work together in one direction, but some individual units are still doing too poorly, there are some chaotic phenomena, and even serious departmentalism still exists. As a result, various phenomena of duplication of work projects and waste of human and material resources have arisen.

The development of Chinese paleontological and stratigraphic research work mainly depends on the quality of graduates from various institutions of higher learning. The Ministry of Geology and the Academy of Sciences should vigorously support and help the teaching and scientific research work of institutions of higher learning, and if necessary, organize some experts to take positions and give lectures.

(2) The issue of cultivating paleontological backbones. Old China left behind a total of more than 300 geological personnel. After liberation, the vast majority of personnel engaged in exploration and teaching work, with only a very small number of personnel engaged in paleontological research. In the past seven years, we have met the needs of the first five-year plan for mineral resources in terms of exploration, and have also trained 6,000 geological cadres, which is something we are proud of. As the head of the Soviet delegation, Soviet Minister of Geology and Mineral Resources Protection Antropov, said at the reception: "At present, Chinese geological workers have overfulfilled the task of resource reserves for the first five-year plan and have increased the number of geological cadres by about twenty times compared with before liberation, which is an amazing achievement and deserves our congratulations…". However, the research of Chinese geological science is still very backward, and the research of Chinese paleontology is even more backward.

At present, the Soviet Union has a team of thousands of paleontologists, while China currently has no more than fifty or sixty paleontological and stratigraphic workers, including the elderly, the young, those who also hold other positions, and those who have recently returned. We want to have at least half the number of personnel currently in the Soviet Union within twelve years in order to organize a team to march towards science. Talent is not manufactured, but cultivated. Some experts can bring three to four people, while others can only cultivate one to two people. Graduates of geological exploration colleges are suitable for exploration work, but are not ideal training objects. Their foreign language skills are poor, and their basic courses are also poor. If we do not provide them with remedial classes and do not provide them with foreign language tools, it will be difficult to achieve the training effect.

Therefore, the lack of paleontological cadres in China is an issue that must be resolved at present.

Some people advocate developing the geology group of the Department of Geology and Geography of Peking University into a Department of Paleontology and enrolling nearly a thousand students; others advocate running a geology major separately at the Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration and strengthening the courses in paleontology and stratigraphy; still others believe that research units can recruit a large number of short-term training classes or send a large number of young people to study in the Soviet Union directly. The above-mentioned measures lack a comprehensive perspective and also ignore the specific conditions of each unit's development history, faculty, infrastructure, and library equipment.

I believe that a multi-pronged approach is a more reasonable policy. That is to say, we should use all the favorable conditions and existing equipment of various institutions and give full play to the positive factors in all aspects to complete this major task, which also conforms to the basic principle of "overall planning and appropriate arrangement" as instructed by Chairman Mao.

Now I propose the following four measures:

1. Vigorously develop the Department of Geology of Peking University and specialize in paleontology. The Department of Geology of Peking University has always had a long history, and more than 90% of Chinese paleontological and stratigraphic workers have graduated from Peking University.

After the adjustment of departments in 1952, the Department of Geology of Peking University was discontinued, and all manpower, material resources, and library equipment were transferred to the Beijing Institute of Geology. Although Peking University started enrolling students the year before last, it is like starting from scratch and reopening. At present, the Department of Geology has not been established separately and cannot enroll a large number of students. In the future, after development, it can gradually increase its enrollment tasks, and finally become the center for training paleontological cadres. Only then can we have the opportunity to obtain more and better training objects.

Running the Department of Geology of Peking University well is a key issue for Chinese geological science at present. The Ministry of Geology, the Academy of Sciences, and the Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration all have the responsibility to support it. At the same time, Peking University should also strive to develop and use all favorable conditions and traditions to make it a veritable Department of Geology like Moscow University.

2. Currently, opening geology major classes in the two geological exploration institutes in Beijing and Changchun to train some paleontological specialists is also a practical transitional method. Both institutes have very good conditions to complete this task, whether from the perspective of cadre strength or equipment. The head of the Paleontological Delegation of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, A.A. Kirpichnikov, once said to us about this glorious task of training cadres: "China has too few paleontological talents, and there is a lack of paleontology and stratigraphy teachers. Nanjing University has only one, Chongqing University has none, only the Beijing Institute of Geology has more paleontological talents and equipment, so all favorable conditions should be used to train cadres in this area."

Therefore, we should not overemphasize the saying that the task of the geological exploration institute is too heavy and that it is not suitable for training paleontological cadres.

3. The backbone of Chinese paleontology is distributed in the Institute of Paleontology and the Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration. Recently, I have learned in Nanjing and Beijing that they can still take more apprentices. Therefore, it is recommended that the Academy of Sciences and institutions of higher learning should recruit enough graduate students. The Ministry of Geology has heavy tasks and needs a large number of paleontological and stratigraphic workers to participate in key regional geological survey comprehensive teams and key external stratigraphic division and correlation work, as well as paleontological and stratigraphic research and identification work. It is necessary to select a group of outstanding young people who have graduated from undergraduate geology and exploration majors in colleges and universities, or have two or three years of field work experience, and who are passionate about paleontology and stratigraphy to participate in the work from bureaus and teams. This is more effective and faster to train than opening short-term training classes.

4. Sending students to study in the Soviet Union is also a good way to train professional talents. There are a total of thirteen Chinese students studying paleontology in the Department of Geology of Moscow University. Except for one lecturer sent by the Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration who has started research, the other twelve are mostly undergraduate students from domestic universities who do not have enough understanding of the specialized research direction of paleontology, and some have some professional ideological problems. This method of sending students is not very suitable.

I also heard at this CPPCC group discussion that some operational departments sent a large number of immature students to study in the Soviet Union, and as a result, they were sent back to China because of their poor foundation and poor Russian.

Therefore, it is recommended that relevant departments should select mature young people to study in the Soviet Union in the future, and they can also be sent to study in various democratic countries. In particular, a group of outstanding young people should be sent to study in the blank categories of our country, which will have a great impact on the development of Chinese paleontological scientific research work.

In learning from the Soviet Union, we can also invite experienced Soviet experts to come to China to train cadres in person, which is another way that is more, better, faster, and more economical.

×　　×　　×

The key tasks and characteristics of paleontological research in the Academy of Sciences, operational departments, and institutions of higher learning are different. Each institution needs to set up separate research units. It should not, and cannot, be monopolized by any one party. In the past, the Geological Research Institute and the Vertebrate Paleontology Research Office of the Institute of Paleontology of the China Geological Work Plan Guidance Committee and the Ministry of Geology were once under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Geology. Due to the large exploration tasks of the Ministry of Geology, the development of basic scientific research was limited to a certain extent. Later, it turned to dualism. The research institute of the Academy of Sciences focuses on basic theoretical research, and the research institutions of the Ministry of Geology focus on supporting production, which can not only complete national production tasks, but also do a good job in scientific research. This is a correct measure.

Whether the paleontological and stratigraphic research work can be carried out mainly depends on the better division of labor and cooperation between the Academy of Sciences, operational departments, and institutions of higher learning. If the division of labor is good, the strength can be strengthened. If the cooperation is not appropriate, the strength can be offset. Overall planning and appropriate arrangements require not only close cooperation between the Academy of Sciences and operational departments, but also clear division of labor between each unit and each institution itself, unified ideological understanding, quick start of scientific research, a trinity, uniting all forces that can be united, resolutely opposing departmentalism, and resolutely opposing dogmatism. These are the main contradictions and the lack of cadres that need to be resolved in our country's scientific research institutions at present. (Attached picture)

    正确安排古生物科学研究机构更好地培养古生物学干部
    孙云铸的发言
    我完全拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上关于社会主义国家人民内部矛盾问题的讲话和各位首长的报告。
    我是一个古生物、地层工作者，也是一个地质教育工作者，现在我结合我们的岗位工作，对下列两个问题提出一些不成熟意见。
    （1）古生物学研究的机构。无论在科学院古生物研究所、地质研究所地层研究室和地质部地矿研究所古生物地层室和孢子花粉研究室、以及其他生产部门相应单位，目前主要任务是为地质学服务，解决一系列地层划分和对比问题，一方面在较短时间内查明更多的有用矿床，同时也保证全国区域地质测量工作的质量；另一方面也要从地层、古生物学科向本身进行古生物、地层基本理论问题的研究工作，以便在十二年内达到或接近国际水平。
    因此，在科学院、地质部和高等学校的古生物工作者，一方面应大力按门类（如有孔虫、菊石等）和时代（石炭纪、三叠纪等）去培养专长，另一方面还要配备一些古生物人员参加重点矿区和区域地质测量综合调查工作，使他们成为区域地质工作者。二方面必须兼顾，决不能片面地强调任何一方面。
    关于各机构古生物研究，主要任务是一致的。就是说，科学院多做一些基本理论研究，同时也要结合生产；地质部和其他业务部门多担一些生产任务，同时也需进行一些科学理论的研究。
    因此，古生物、地层研究机构方向的问题，和其他一些工科性各专业有些不同，不在翻天覆地归并而在合理地协商和分工，团结合作，更重要的是结合各单位发展情况和特点来处理问题，从速展开科研工作，同时进行一些个别调整，决不能盲目地裁并。但不等于说在一些业务部门内而无任何条件所成立的新的机构也都要一一保留下来。
    我们地质古生物工作的分工是在一个大的中心问题下的项目研究的分工，领导的分工，研究区域的分工，从出版刊物方面的分工，在培养专业干部方面的分工，在图书设备上互助。最近国内各古生物研究机构以及几乎每一位古生物地层工作者均愿向一方向努力合作，但是个别单位做的还是太差，多少有一些忙乱现象，甚至还存有严重本位主义。因而就产生了工作项目的重复和人力物力浪费的各种现象。
    中国古生物地层研究工作的发展，主要决定于各高等学校毕业学生的质量；目前高等学校教学和科学研究工作地质部和科学院应当大力支持和帮助，必要时组织一些专家去任职和兼课。
    （2）培养古生物骨干问题。旧中国遗留下总共地质人员三百余人，解放后绝大部分人员从事勘探和教学工作，仅留极小部分人员从事古生物学的研究。七年来在勘探方面满足了第一个五年计划所需要的矿产资源，并且还培养出六千地质干部，这是我们感到光荣的。正如最近以苏联代表团团长苏联地质和矿藏保护部部长安特罗波夫在招待会上说：“目前中国地质工作者超额完成了第一个五年计划资源储量的任务和比解放前增加了约二十倍地质干部是一项惊人成绩，值得我们向大家祝贺的……”。但是，目前中国地质科学的研究还很落后，中国古生物学的研究更为落后。
    目前苏联拥有千名古生物队伍，而中国目前古生物、地层工作者，包括老年的，青年的，以及兼任它项工作的和新近归队的在内总共不过五、六十人。我们想在十二年内至少要有苏联目前半数以上人员，才能组织队伍向科学进军。人材不是制造出来的而是培养出来的。有的专家可以带三——四人，有的只能培养一——二人。地质勘探学院毕业学生适宜做勘探工作，但不是理想的培养对象，他们的外文差，基础课也差，如果不为他们补课，不为他们补习外文工具的话，就很难收到培养的效果。
    因此，中国古生物干部的缺乏是目前必须解决的问题。
    有人主张将北大地质地理系地质组发展成为古生物系，并招收近千名学生；也有人主张单独在北京地质勘探学院办地质专业，加强古生物、地层课程；还有人认为各研究单位可以大量招收短期训练班或直接送大批青年赴苏联学习。上列措施，均缺乏全面的观点，并且还忽视各单位发展历史、师资、基建和图书设备的具体情况。
    我认为多方并进是一个比较合理的政策。就是说，我们应当利用各个机构一切有利条件和已有设备，充分发挥各方面积极因素来完成这项重大任务，这也符合毛主席所指示“统筹兼顾和适当安排”的基本原则。
    现在我提出下列四项措施：
    1、大力发展北京大学地质系，古生物系专门化。北大地质系一向有悠久的历史，中国古生物地层工作者90％以上均系从北大毕业的。
    1952年院系调整后，北大地质系停办，所有一切人力，物力和图书设备等均转入北京地质学院。虽然，北大前年开始招生，但从无到有，和重新开办一样。目前地质系尚未单独建立，尚不能大量招生，将来发展后逐年可以增加它的招生任务，最后成为培养古生物干部的中心时。我们才有可能得到更多更好的培养对象。
    办好北大地质系是目前中国地质科学一个关键性问题，地质部、科学院、北京地质勘探学院均有责任支持，同时北大也应该努力地争取发展，利用一切有利条件和传统使它成为一个名副其实的和莫斯科大学一样的地质系。
    2、目前在北京、长春两个地质勘探学院开设地质专业班，培养一些古生物专门化人才，也是一种切实可行的过渡办法。无论从干部力量和设备方面去看，两院都有很好条件能完成。这个光荣的培养干部任务，苏联科学院古生物代表团A·A·基尔比契尼科夫所长曾对我们说过：“中国古生物人材太少，更缺乏古生物、地层教师，南大只有一位，重大一位都没有，只有北京地质学院拥有较多古生物人材和设备，就应当利用所有一切有利条件去培养这方面干部。”
    因此，我们不应过分强调地质勘探学院任务过重和不适宜培养古生物干部的说法。
    3、中国古生物骨干分布在古生物研究所和北京地质勘探学院，最近我在南京和北京初步了解，他们还可多带徒弟。因此建议科学院和高等学校应招收足够研究生。地质部任务重，更需要大批古生物地层工作者参加重点区域地质测量综合队和重点外区地层划分和对比工作，以及古生物、地层研究和鉴定工作，就必须从局、队选拔一批高等院校地质勘探专业本科毕业生，或有二、三年野外工作经验，并且对古生物、地层热爱的优秀青年来参加工作。这样做，较之开办短期训练班收效较大，培养也较快。
    4、派送赴苏联留学也是一项培养专业人材的好的办法。莫斯科大学地质系共有中国学生十三人学习古生物学。除去一位由北京地质勘探学院派送出去的讲师已开始研究外，其余十二人多系国内高等学校未毕业学生，对古生物专门化研究方向认识不够，个别的发生一些专业思想问题，这种派送办法是不太适合的。
    在这次政协小组座谈会也听到，有些业务部门派送大批未成熟学生到苏联学习，其结果由于基础差，俄文差，跟不上班，被送回国了。
    因此，建议各有关部门今后应选派成熟青年去苏联学习，也可派到各民主国家去学习。特别要送一批优秀青年去学本国空白门类，这对中国古生物科学研究工作的发展是有极大作用。
    在学习苏联方面，还可邀请有经验的苏联专家亲自来中国培养干部，这又是一种又多又好又快又省的办法。
          ×　　×　　×
    科学院、业务部门和高等院校古生物研究的工作重点任务和特点不同，各机构均有设立别个研究单位的必要，决不应该，也不可能由任何一方去包办下来。过去中国地质工作计划指导委员会和地质部初成立时期地质研究所和古生物研究所古脊椎动物研究室曾一度隶属地质部。由于地质部勘探任务大，基本科学研究的发展受到一定限制。后来才转入二元化。科学院研究所以基本理论研究为主，地质部研究机构以配合生产为主，既能完成国家生产任务，又能做好科学研究工作，这是一项正确的措施。
    古生物、地层研究工作的开展与否，主要关键是在科学院、业务部门和高等院校的更好的分工和配合。分工得好力量可以加强，配合不得当，力量可以抵消。统筹兼顾，合理安排，不但科学院、业务部门要密切地配合，就是各研究机构本身各单元和各院校本身也要明确地分工，统一思想认识，从速开展科研，三位一体，团结一切可能团结的力量，坚决反对本位主义，坚决反对教条主义，是解决目前我国科学研究机构的主要矛盾和干部缺乏的问题。（附图片）
