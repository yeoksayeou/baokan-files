Xinhua News Agency, March 15th: The plenary session of the National Committee of the CPPCC continued its general discussions this morning and afternoon. Forty-six CPPCC members and attendees spoke.

	Burhan Shahidi, Vice Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, said in his speech at the morning session that, inspired by the spirit of the Bandung Conference, the power of the people of the Middle East and Near East countries against imperialist aggression is growing. This is unstoppable by any force. He introduced the situation of leading cultural and artistic delegations and Hajj delegations to visit Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other countries last year.
	Jian Rennan, a professor at Dalian Medical College, said that as a Taiwanese, he especially hopes to achieve the peaceful liberation of Taiwan as soon as possible. He criticized the waste of beds in the sanatorium of Lüda City and the shocking waste in the Dalian Hospital of the Ministry of Railways.
	Wang Jiaxiang expressed his views on international relations.
	Zhao Junmai believes that good national sports should be promoted.
	Zuo Xiezong, who attended the meeting, said that before the meeting, he specially investigated fifteen agricultural cooperatives in Baqiao District, Xi'an City, his hometown, and the specific facts that most farmers have increased their income, which shows the necessity and superiority of cooperation.
	Zeng Zhaolun, Deputy Minister of Higher Education, said that although the number of enrollments in universities this year is less than last year, it is still normal compared with the average number of enrollments in the first five-year plan; moreover, together with the actual number of enrollments in the previous four years, it exceeds the original enrollment number of the first five-year plan by 3.7%.
	Chen Mingde, deputy director of the Shanghai "Xinmin Evening News," spoke on the issue of "freedom of the press."
	Wen Shaohe, executive member of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said that industrialists and businessmen in Sichuan Province have played an active role after the overall joint venture, but some people have also shown a negative side after the overall joint venture. This requires industrialists and businessmen to work hard to transform themselves, combine personal interests with national interests, establish a sense of ownership, and love joint ventures.
	Scientist Wang Dezhao, who returned to the motherland only two months ago, said that what he saw and heard after returning to China made him too moved and too excited. The motherland has made amazing progress in scientific research, and many scientific papers have reached international standards. But he felt that there are not enough experimental papers at present.
	In the morning, sixteen other people made written speeches. They are: Yan Fuqing, Tang Wuyuan, Shi Xiaoshan, Lian Ruiqi, Feng Shaoshan, Deng Yuzhi, Meng Mudi, Dong Zhujun, Li Dachao, Han Pengtai, Wang Kangzhi, Gu Jiegang, Li Peiji, Ye Gongchuo, Zhao Shuping, and Qin Bowen.
	At the afternoon meeting, Deng Chumin first said that Chairman Mao's teachings of "strengthening ideological education work," unfolding "criticism and self-criticism," "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," and "overall planning and appropriate arrangements" are the most correct policies for handling contradictions among the people in socialist society.
	Dong Weichuan, Vice President of Beijing Normal University, believes that guiding young people who cannot go to school to the countryside is a broad and correct path. He said that in the future, attention should be paid to strengthening labor education, basic production technology education, and political and ideological education for middle and primary school students.
	Kang Tongbi, a librarian at the Central Research Institute of Culture and History, believes that the issue of induced abortion should be carefully considered.
	Luo Ziwei, a member of the preparatory committee of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives, explained in detail the current problems of the handicraft industry in terms of raw material supply, product processing, purchase, and exclusive sales.

	Zhu Xuefan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke on the work of the trade unions. He talked about the outstanding achievements of the national trade union work in promoting the advanced producer movement and the wage and welfare work of employees last year. He said that this year, employees across the country should further deepen the advanced producer movement.
	Lian Kuoru, Deputy Director of the Chinese Quyi Research Association, proposed that while sorting out the traditional Quyi heritage, he hopes to combine the work of arranging old artists with the work of training the next generation of Quyi artists.
	Jiang Shufeng, who attended the meeting, introduced the gradual development of the work of the CPPCC Yangzhou Municipal Committee.

	Yu Zitan, an engineer at the Paper Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry, said that the Paper Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry is taking various measures to increase paper production, and it also relies on the joint efforts of all paper-using departments to fundamentally solve the problem of paper shortages.
	Wang Zhenxin, a specialist at the Ministry of Agriculture, suggested that a special agency be organized in the Academy of Agricultural Sciences to hire veteran experts in the agricultural field to carry out research and collation of the agricultural heritage of the motherland.
