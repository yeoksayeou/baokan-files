Since last winter and this spring, the phenomenon of peasants blindly flowing into cities in Guangdong Province has been very serious. According to incomplete statistics from the construction industry, handicrafts industry, transportation industry, industry, and cultural and educational systems in Guangzhou City alone, more than 30,000 peasants have been absorbed, and there are approximately 10,000 more scattered on the streets. It is estimated that the total number of peasants blindly flowing into Guangzhou City is no less than 50,000. This not only increases the burden on the city, increases the tension in supply, and makes public security management more difficult, but also seriously affects the progress of spring plowing and production in rural areas. According to a report from the CPC Qingyuan County Committee, more than 7,400 people in their county have left the countryside. In the Dashi Gang Third Agricultural Production Cooperative in Panyu County, 95 out of 100 male laborers have left. In the Five Village Second Cooperative, which originally had 70 male laborers, only one Party branch secretary remains. The departure and outflow of these people has made it impossible to carry out the current spring plowing and production. The slow progress of spring plowing and production in Qingyuan County is an important reason for this.

At the same time as peasants blindly flow into the cities, new "labor contractors" have appeared in the cities. According to a survey by the Guangzhou Municipal Labor Bureau, there are now as many as 60 "labor contractors" in Guangzhou. These "labor contractors" are just like the old "labor contractors": they only know how to exploit and make money, and they don't care about the life or death of the peasants at all. They force the peasants to dig in places where they cannot dig, resulting in serious casualties.

In order to mobilize peasants to return to the countryside for production, Guangzhou City, according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, has recently taken many specific measures. The Municipal Civil Affairs Department allocated 30,000 yuan for travel expenses for peasants who have no specific employers and are unable to return to their hometowns. The负责人 of the Municipal Labor Department personally went to the construction sites to explain the importance of returning to the countryside for production. After a series of mobilization and persuasion efforts, 9,000 of the 10,000 peasants privately recruited by the construction system have now returned. It is expected that the 30,000 peasants who were privately recruited without the approval of the labor department will all return to their hometowns by the end of the month. The vacant jobs will be filled by urban residents who are not yet employed and existing labor teams. In addition, the court is also preparing to punish some "labor contractors" engaged in illegal activities.

　　动员盲目流入城市的农民回乡生产
　　林里  向青
    去冬今春以来，广东省农民盲目流入城市的现象十分严重。仅广州市建筑业、手工业、交通运输业、工业和文教系统的不完全统计，就吸收了三万多农民，另有流散街头的大约一万名。估计盲目流入广州市的农民总数不下五万人。这不仅加重了城市的负担，增加了供应的紧张和治安管理工作的困难，而且严重地影响着农村春耕生产的进行。据中共清远县委报告，他们县里有七千四百多人离开了农村。番禺县大石岗第三农业生产合作社，一百名男劳动力中，竟走了九十五名。五村二社原有七十个男劳动力，现在只剩下了一个支部书记。这些人的出走和外流，使当前的春耕生产无法进行。清远县春耕生产迟滞不前，这是一个重要原因。
    在农民盲目流入城市的同时，城市出现了新的“包工头”。据广州市劳动局调查，现在广州市的“包工头”有六十人之多。这些“包工头”，也跟旧日的“包工头”一样：只知剥削赚钱，根本不顾农民死活。他们逼着农民到不能挖土的地方去挖土，结果造成严重的伤亡事故。
    为了动员农民回乡生产，最近广州市根据省委指示，已经采取了许多具体措施，市民政部门给无具体雇主，又实在无法回乡的农民拨了三万元的车船费；市劳动部门的负责人，亲自深入工地，说明回乡生产的重要性。经过一连串的动员说服，建筑系统私自招收的一万名农民，现已返回了九千。未经劳动部门而私自招雇的三万名农民，预计月底可以全部回乡。空下来的工作，将由城市尚未就业的市民和现有劳动队补填。此外，法院还准备惩办一些从事非法活动的“包工头”。
