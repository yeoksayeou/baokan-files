Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 22nd: To mark the 30th anniversary of the three armed uprisings by Shanghai workers on the 21st, Shanghai's trade union organizations have widely conducted education on revolutionary traditions among the city's workers.

　　In front of the "Hall of Glory" in the city center, young workers, white-haired elders, mothers holding children, and Young Pioneers wearing red scarves crowded together to view photos of the uprisings taken thirty years ago. Zhou Huizhu, a worker's daughter and Young Pioneer, carefully copied the captions of the pictures, preparing to participate in discussions back at school. Xu Zhutang, an eighteen-year-old worker, stood in front of a picture of workers' pickets drilling for a long time. He said to the person next to him, "Thirty years ago, when the old revolutionaries took up arms to fight the warlords, I wasn't even born yet. We must properly complete the tasks that the martyrs did not finish – building our motherland."

　　Some of the old workers who participated in the struggle back then went to workers' cultural palaces and district clubs to report to the workers about their personal experiences of the struggle. Two thousand employees from the commercial sector listened to the recollections of old shop assistant Xu Weixian, old worker Qian Yunqing, and others yesterday. The Shanghai Municipal First Commercial Bureau system will also organize a wired broadcast report meeting for 20,000 people to listen to.

　　The auditorium on the third floor of the Quangong Building—the site of a tragic incident in 1947 where Shanghai shop assistants advocated "using domestic goods and resisting American goods"—yesterday began exhibiting pictures of the three armed uprisings by Shanghai workers and historical materials on the revolutionary struggles of Shanghai shop assistants. The Shanghai Workers' Cultural Palace also organized picture exhibitions of the three armed uprisings in large factories such as the Shanghai Motor Factory, the Shanghai Wire Factory, and the Dalong Machine Factory.

　  继承光荣的革命传统
　　上海纪念三次武装起义
    据新华社上海22日电　21日是上海工人三次武装起义三十周年，上海的工会组织向全市职工广泛进行了革命传统的教育。
    在市中心的“光荣廊”前，年轻工人、白发老人、搀着孩子的妈妈和围着红领巾的小学生，拥挤着观看三十年前拍摄的起义图片。工人的女儿、少先队员周慧珠，细心地抄下了图片的文字说明，准备回到学校参加讨论。十八岁的青年工人徐竹堂，在一张工人纠察队正在操练的图片前看了好久，他向旁边的人说：“三十年前老前辈们拿起枪杆打军阀的时候，我还没有出世呢。烈士们没有完成的任务——建设我们的祖国，我们要好好的来完成。”
    当年参加斗争的部分老工人，出动到工人文化宫、各区俱乐部向工人报告过去亲身经历的斗争情景。两千名商业部门的职工，昨天听了老店员徐维铣、老工人钱云青等的回忆报告。上海市第一商业局系统，还将组织一次有两万人收听的有线广播报告会。
    1947年上海店员为了提倡“爱用国货、抵制美货”而发生惨案的所在地——劝工大楼三楼礼堂，昨天开始展出了上海工人三次武装起义的图片和上海店员革命斗争史料。上海工人文化宫也在上海电机厂、上海电线厂、大隆机器厂等大型厂，组织了三次武装起义的图片展览。
