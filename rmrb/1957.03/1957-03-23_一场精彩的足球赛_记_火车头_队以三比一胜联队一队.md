　　A Wonderful Football Match
　　——“Lokomotiv” Team Wins 3-1 Against Combined Team One
    Just four minutes into the game, amidst the cheers and applause of the audience, Nian Weisi, the center forward of Combined Team One, swiftly advanced with the ball towards the Soviet "Lokomotiv" territory. Confidently, he suddenly lobbed the ball into the opponent's penalty area. Left winger Wang Lu rushed forward and took a shot, but the ball was saved by the goalkeeper out of bounds, resulting in a corner kick for Combined Team One. Wang Lu kicked the ball towards the goalmouth, and the clever Nian Weisi pretended to jump for a header, diverting the attention of the opponent's defenders and goalkeeper. Instead, he intentionally let the ball pass to Zhang Honggen behind him, who followed up with a "volley," sending the ball into the net. This goal was very beautiful and clean. However, they failed to score another goal, and ultimately lost 3-1.

    Guest Team Scores a Surprise Goal
    The experienced guest team did not panic after conceding a goal. They tenaciously and calmly organized a counter-attack. By the eleventh minute, the ball was swirling in the home team's territory. The guest team's midfielder, Bilyulin, suddenly unleashed a surprise shot from the crowd. With a resounding crack, Zhang Junxiu failed to make the save due to obstructed vision, and the ball grazed the goalpost and went into the net. The guest team easily equalized. After that, both sides engaged in a seesaw battle, each testing the opponent's goal several times, but the efforts were thwarted by the respective goalkeepers, resulting in no further scores.

    Home Team Performed Excellently in the First Half
    The defense and attack of Combined Team One were well-organized in the first half. The brave and tenacious Zhang Jingtian closely marked the guest team's key player, Bubukin, repeatedly disrupting and restricting the guest team's attack. The three defenders firmly held their positions in the penalty area, rarely venturing out, so the guest team's specialty of using large crosses and widening the flanks for central breakthroughs could not be employed. Zhang Junxiu cautiously defended against the guest team's long-range shots. In attack, the quick and accurate long passes of midfielder Wang Xiwen and the defenders, the interweaving and crossing of Fang Renqiu, Nian Weisi, and Zhang Honggen in the opponent's penalty area, and Wang Lu's rapid advances along the touchline all posed a great threat to the guest team. Therefore, Combined Team One's offensive dominated the first half.

    Guest Team's Flood and Ebb Tactics Prove Effective
    In the second half, the guest team took advantage of their abundant stamina to launch a full-scale flood and ebb style of attack and defense. When attacking, all the defenders charged forward, and the midfielders joined the forward line, forming seven forwards. When defending, the two wings retreated, and the forwards actively intercepted the ball, preventing the opponent from organizing an attack. At this time, many players of the home team felt physically exhausted and struggled to keep up. The audience clearly felt that the attack speed had slowed down, there were more gaps in the defensive line, and it seemed that there were more players on the field for the "Lokomotiv" team. In the eighteenth minute, the guest team was awarded a corner kick. The left winger lightly passed the ball to Voroshilov, who was supporting on the side. Voroshilov lobbed the ball, and center forward Sokolov rounded the defender and scored with a powerful shot, making the score 2-1. Not even ten minutes later, Voroshilov, with Sokolov's support, dribbled past the defender and scored another goal. After that, although Combined Team One also tried to organize several attacks, they failed to achieve anything. (Guo An)

　　一场精彩的足球赛
　　——记“火车头”队以三比一胜联队一队
    比赛开始刚四分钟，在观众的呐喊和鼓掌声中，联队一队的中锋年维泗飞快地带着球向苏联“火车头”的阵地挺进，他胸有成竹地突然将球吊向对方禁区，左翼王陆奔上便是一脚，但是球被守门员扑出界外，由联队一队罚角球。王陆一脚将球踢至门前，机智的年维泗假装跃起头顶，转移了对方后卫和守门员的注意力，他却故意将球漏给后面的右锋张宏根，张宏根赶上一记“落地开花”将球射入大门。这个球打得非常漂亮、利落。但是他们始终没有再攻进一个球，而最后反以三比一败北。
    客队冷箭得分
    战斗经验丰富的客队在输了一球后并没有惊惶失措，他们顽强地、沉着地组织反攻。至十一分钟时，球在主队的腹地盘旋。客队前卫比柳林在人丛中突放冷箭，砰然一脚，张俊秀因视线被人挡住扑救不及，球擦门柱进网，客队轻易地扳回了一个球。此后，双方展开了拉锯战，彼此都试叩了几次门，但都被对方的守门员接住，各无建树。
    主队上半时打得出色
    联队一队的防守和进攻在上半时组织得很出色。勇猛、顽强的张京天死盯住客队的灵魂布布金，一再地破坏和箝制了客队的进攻。三个后卫在禁区严密坐镇，轻易不撤兵外出，因此客队专长的利用大交叉和两翼拉开然后中央突破的战术始终未能用上，张俊秀谨慎地防守着客队的远射。在进攻上，前卫王锡文和后卫的长传球快而准，方纫秋、年维泗和张宏根在对方禁区的穿插、交叉，王陆的端线飞快推进都给客队很大的威胁，因此上半时联队一队的攻势占大部分。
    客队涨潮、退潮式战术见效
    下半时，客队利用体力充沛的优点展开了涨潮式和退潮式的全面进攻和防守的战术，进攻时后卫全部冲出，前卫加入了锋线形成七个前锋，退守时两翼撤回，前锋积极抢截球，不让对方组织进攻。而主队这时很多队员已感到体力不支疲于奔命，观众明显地感到进攻速度已慢，卫线上的漏人也多，球场上“火车头”队的队员好像多了不少人。在十八分钟时，客队取得了罚角球的机会，左翼轻轻一脚将球传给在旁策应的沃罗希洛夫，沃将球一挑，中锋索科洛夫绕过后卫一记劲射，使场上记录成二比一。过不十分钟，沃罗希洛夫在索科洛夫的策应下，盘过了后卫又射进了一球。此后，联队一队虽然也努力地组织了几次进攻，但始终未有所获。（国安）
