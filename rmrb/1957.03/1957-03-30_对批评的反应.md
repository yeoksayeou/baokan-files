Column: Response to Criticism

　　Response to Criticism
    The People's Daily published an article entitled "Never a Final Draft" on November 1, 1956, criticizing our bureau for a document (the Work Plan for Mobilizing Unemployed and Unoccupied Personnel and Surplus Workers in the Transportation System in this City to Participate in National Construction in the Northwest Region) issued to various districts in January of last year, which was never finalized even after the work was completed.
    We believe this criticism is correct. The phenomenon of drafts never being finalized is not an isolated case in our bureau, which reflects a lack of planning in our work and a lack of clarity about the work being done. We will certainly overcome this shortcoming in the future.

专栏：对批评的反应

　　对批评的反应
    人民日报1956年11月1日发表“永无定稿”一文，批评我局在去年1月份发给各区的一份文件（关于动员本市失业人员、无业人员及交通运输系统多余工人参加西北地区国家建设的工作方案）直到工作结束还未定稿。
    我们认为这个批评是正确的。草案永不定稿的现象在我们局里不是个别的现象，这反映了我们的工作中计划性不强，对所进行的工作心中无数。今后我们一定切实地克服这个缺点。
