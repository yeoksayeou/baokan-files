Please allow me and several comrades to give a joint statement on our impressions of visiting Tibet.

In March of last year, the Central Delegation went to Lhasa to congratulate the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and to express condolences to the monks, nuns, and people of Tibet. We were honored to participate in the delegation and had the opportunity to walk on the "Roof of the World," passing through the Qinghai-Tibet and Kang-Tibet highways and the road to Yadong. Some comrades also reached the westernmost Ali region. On the way back, some of us also took the first trial flight, taking a panoramic view of the vast, extensive, majestic, and magnificent landscape of our motherland.

In three months, we came into contact with a hardworking, brave, and intelligent brotherly ethnic group in the big family of the motherland, which made us deeply appreciate the close unity of the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups and the great success of the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic policies.

In the past, due to the instigation of imperialism and the deception and oppression of reactionary rule, there had been long-term and serious estrangement between the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups, and even within Tibet itself, there could not be good unity. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Central People's Government and the Tibetan local government signed the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, implementing the policies of ethnic equality and freedom of religious belief. The People's Liberation Army entering Tibet and the personnel working in Tibet not only correctly implemented the central government's policies, but also maintained the excellent style of hard work, simplicity, caution, and perseverance, and respected the Tibetan people and served the Tibetan people with concrete actions, gaining the heartfelt trust of the Tibetan local government and the monks, nuns, and people of Tibet, thereby enhancing better unity between the Han and Tibetan people and within the Tibetan people.

The Central Delegation, headed by Vice Premier Chen Yi and composed of representatives from seventeen brotherly ethnic groups and various democratic parties and people's organizations, sincerely expressed the concern and importance attached to Tibet by the central government and all ethnic groups. Wherever the Central Delegation went, Tibetan compatriots lined the streets to welcome them, further improving relations between the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups and opening a new chapter in the history of ethnic unity in the motherland.

The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has close ties with the motherland.

Tibet has vast land and abundant resources, but a small population and an undeveloped economy. Since the peaceful liberation, thanks to the wise leadership of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, the patriotism of the upper-class people has been improved to varying degrees, the monks, nuns, and people have worked together, and with the help of the central government in various aspects, trade, banking, postal, and telecommunications agencies have been established in various regions and towns, and roads have been built, schools have been established, hospitals have been built, agriculture and animal husbandry have been improved, and water conservancy projects have been built. Tibet's economic and cultural undertakings have made certain progress. The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has taken another step forward in political construction, further consolidating the position of the Tibetan people in the big family of the motherland and strengthening their ties with the motherland.

The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni are the political and religious leaders of the Tibetan people. Thanks to their wise leadership and sincere cooperation, the face of Tibet has been completely renewed. The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni unanimously believe that only by developing the economy, improving the people's living standards, and ensuring the status of the lamas can there be true freedom of religious belief. They also believe that the development of Tibet's economy requires the support of all aspects of the motherland, so it is necessary to closely unite around the Chinese Communist Party and advance side by side with the brotherly ethnic groups in the big family of the motherland. This firm and unshakable policy is also the common aspiration of the upper-class people and all monks, nuns, and people in Tibet. Because of this, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni are increasingly respected and loved by the monks, nuns, and people of Tibet. And the construction of Tibet can also develop steadily.

The unity of the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups cannot be separated.

However, the more the unity of our country's ethnic groups progresses, the more unwilling imperialism and reactionaries become. Even now, they are still trying every means to sow discord, with the aim of undermining the unity of our country's ethnic groups and endangering the happy lives of the Tibetan people. Of course, this kind of despicable trick is futile. The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni have seen through this conspiracy and have made clear statements at the inaugural meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. The Dalai Lama said: "The people and officials of all strata in Tibet have clearly realized from practice that only by being vigilant at all times and opposing the conspiracies of imperialism to provoke and sabotage, striving to improve patriotic thought, and truly strengthening and consolidating the unity of the motherland and the unity of ethnic groups, and strengthening the internal unity and solidarity of Tibet, can we truly do a good job in various tasks, seek progress and development, and build a prosperous and happy new Tibet on the general road of building a socialist motherland." The Panchen Erdeni said: "Historical facts tell us that only on the basis of anti-imperialist patriotism can we strengthen the unity between and within ethnic groups; only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, in the common construction of the great socialist motherland, can there be happiness and prosperity in Tibet. Similarly, only in this way can the Tibetan people contribute more of their own strength and fulfill their glorious responsibilities in the common construction of the great socialist motherland."

We believe that this solemn and wise statement is a head-on blow to imperialism and also raises the vigilance of all the people of Tibet. Now, we can say with certainty that any attempt to sow discord among the Tibetan people is a waste of effort, and the close unity between Tibet and the motherland is unbreakable.

Helping Tibetan compatriots develop the economy and improve their lives

Although Tibet has made some progress in recent years, it is only a beginning. We believe that the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland have a responsibility to help Tibetan compatriots carry out construction, improve their material and cultural living standards, and enable all brotherly ethnic groups to jointly move towards a prosperous and happy socialist society. But it must be understood that Tibetan compatriots have a long and glorious history in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects. To develop Tibet's economy and culture, it must be carried out gradually based on Tibet's actual conditions and should be carried out automatically by the Tibetan local government. At the same time, it should be especially pointed out that not only should their customs and habits be respected, but also the Tibetan people's freedom of religious belief must be respected. What we have seen and heard in Tibet has made us deeply aware that the Tibetan people are extremely protective of their religion. The reason why the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni have the highest prestige among the Tibetan people is because the people have a lofty faith in Buddhism, and they are the leaders of Buddhism. Freedom of religious belief is enshrined in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and the people of the whole country must earnestly abide by it. We should not only protect the lama temples and protect the Tibetan people's freedom of religious belief, but also ensure that the income of the temples is not reduced, which is very necessary. We should also criticize any erroneous remarks that violate ethnic policies and religious policies.

The young people and scientific workers from all over the country who have gone to Tibet are the greatest pillars of the construction cause on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and we should express our respect to them. They go to Tibet to help Tibetan compatriots develop politics, economy, and improve cultural and educational life, not to take over and replace them. We live in a socialist family and have the obligation to help Tibetan compatriots, but we do not have the right to replace them. We must thoroughly eliminate the remaining thoughts of Han chauvinism, closely cooperate with Tibetan compatriots at all times and places, and help them train cadres.

Further develop Tibet's transportation industry

Finally, the most important issue in Tibet at present is transportation. Although the opening of the Qinghai-Tibet and Kang-Tibet highways has greatly changed the transportation landscape of Tibet. However, with only highways and newly opened air routes, the supply of materials and economic development are still insufficient. We hope that in the near future, trains will be able to travel between Beijing and Lhasa, which will not only help consolidate national defense and the economic prosperity of the plateau region, but also enable Tibetan compatriots to come to the mainland frequently, and the people of all ethnic groups in the country will also have the opportunity to visit the great rivers and mountains of the motherland, so that they can better understand the glory and happiness of living in a socialist family.

Long live the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in China!

### 促进汉藏两族人民更好的团结  黄琪翔、巩天民、孙云铸、吴觉农、何思源联合发言

    促进汉藏两族人民更好的团结
    黄琪翔、巩天民、孙云铸、吴觉农、何思源联合发言
    请允许我和几位同志就访问西藏的观感作一次联合发言。
    去年3月间，中央代表团赴拉萨祝贺西藏自治区筹备委员会成立，并对西藏僧俗人民进行慰问。我们很荣幸地参加了代表团，有机会走上“世界屋脊”，经过青藏、康藏两大公路和到亚东的公路，部分同志，还到了最西部的阿里地区。回来时，有的又乘第一次试航飞机，再总览了一下祖国的辽阔、广大、雄伟、壮丽的锦绣河山。
    在三个月中，我们接触到祖国大家庭中一个勤劳、勇敢、智慧的兄弟民族，使我们深深地体会到汉藏两大民族的紧密团结和中国共产党民族政策的伟大成功。
    过去由于帝国主义的挑拨离间，和反动统治的欺骗压迫，汉藏两大民族曾长期发生过严重的隔阂，即西藏内部也因此不能很好的团结。西藏和平解放以后，中央人民政府和西藏地方政府订立了和平解放西藏办法的协议，贯彻了民族平等和宗教信仰自由的方针。入藏的人民解放军和在西藏的工作人员，不但正确地执行了中央的政策，而且保持了艰苦朴素、谨慎耐劳的优良作风，并以具体行动尊重西藏民族和为西藏民族服务，取得了西藏地方政府和西藏僧俗人民衷心的信任，从而增进了汉藏人民和西藏人民内部更好的团结。
    中央代表团，是以陈毅副总理为首，由十七个兄弟民族和各民主党派各人民团体的代表所组成，真诚地表示了中央和各族人民对西藏的关怀和重视。中央代表团所到之地，藏族同胞都夹道欢迎，进一步改善了汉藏民族关系，在祖国的民族团结史上揭开了崭新的一页。
    西藏自治区筹委会的成立密切了西藏同祖国的关系
    西藏有广阔的土地和丰富的资源，但人口稀少经济还未发展。自和平解放后，由于达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的英明领导，上层人士的爱国主义思想有不同程度的提高，僧俗人民的齐心努力和中央在各方面的帮助，各地区各城镇设立了贸易、银行、邮电等机关，并修筑公路，设立学校，建设医院，改良农牧，兴修水利，西藏的经济文化事业已有一定的进步。西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，在政治建设上又前进了一步，更加巩固了西藏民族在祖国大家庭中的地位，密切了同祖国的关系。
    达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼是西藏人民的政教领袖，由于他们的英明领导和精诚合作，西藏的面貌已焕然一新。达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼一致认为：只有发展经济，提高人民生活水平和保证喇嘛的地位，才能有真正的宗教信仰自由。他们又认为发展西藏经济需要祖国各方面的支持，因此就有必要紧密团结在中国共产党的周围，同祖国大家庭中各兄弟民族并肩前进。这种坚定不移的方针，也是西藏上层人士和全体僧俗人民的共同愿望。正因为如此，达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼越来越受到西藏僧俗人民更崇高的爱戴。而西藏的建设，也就能以稳步发展。
    汉藏两族的团结是不能离间的
    可是，我国各民族的团结工作越是向前进展，帝国主义和反动分子却越不甘心。即使在现在，他们仍在千方百计地进行挑拨离间，目的是想破坏我们祖国各民族的团结，危害西藏人民的幸福生活。当然，这种卑鄙的勾当是徒劳的，达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼看穿了这种阴谋，在西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会上早已有了明确的表示。达赖喇嘛说：“西藏各阶层人民和官员从实践中明确认识到只有时时刻刻警惕和反对帝国主义的挑拨破坏阴谋，努力提高爱国主义思想，确实加强和巩固祖国的统一和民族团结，加强西藏内部的统一和团结，才能真正做好各项工作，求得进步和发展，才能在建设社会主义祖国的总道路上建设起繁荣幸福的新西藏。”班禅额尔德尼说：“历史事实告诉我们：只有在反帝爱国的基础上，才能加强民族间与民族内部的团结；只有在中国共产党的领导下，在共同建设伟大的社会主义祖国中，才有西藏的幸福和繁荣。同样的也只有这样，才能使西藏人民在共同建设伟大的社会主义祖国中，更多地贡献出自己的力量，尽到自己光荣的责任。”
    我们认为这种庄严的英明的表示，就是给帝国主义的一个迎头痛击，同时，也提高了西藏全体人民的警惕。现在，我们可以肯定地说：任何对西藏人民的挑拨离间都是枉费心机的，西藏与祖国的紧密团结是牢不可破的。
    帮助西藏同胞发展经济改善生活
    几年来西藏虽已有了一定程度的进步，但还仅仅是个开端，我们认为：祖国各族人民有责任帮助西藏同胞进行建设，提高物质生活和文化生活水平，使各兄弟民族共同走向繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。但必须了解：西藏同胞在政治、经济、文化等各方面有其悠久和光荣的历史。要发展西藏的经济和文化，必须依据西藏的实际情况逐步进行，并且应该由西藏地方政府自动地进行。同时，更应该特别指出：不但要尊重他们的风俗习惯，还必须尊重西藏人民的宗教信仰自由。我们在西藏的所闻所见，使我们深刻地认识到西藏人民对于自己的宗教是极端爱护的。达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼在西藏人民中所以有最高的威信，就是因为人民对佛教有崇高的信仰，而他们正是佛教的领袖。宗教信仰自由载在中华人民共和国宪法，全国人民必须切实遵守。我们不但应保护喇嘛寺庙，和保护西藏人民有宗教信仰的自由，还应该使寺庙的收入不致减少，这是非常必要的。我们也应该批判任何违反民族政策和宗教政策的错误的言论。
    到西藏去的各地青年和科学工作者，他们都是青藏高原上帮助建设事业的最大支柱，我们应向他们表示敬意。他们到西藏去是帮助藏族同胞发展政治、经济和提高文化教育生活，决不是去包办代替。我们生活在社会主义的大家庭中，有帮助藏族同胞的义务，没有代替他们的权利，我们要彻底肃清大汉族主义的残余思想，随时随地和藏族同胞亲密合作，并且帮助他们培养干部。
    进一步发展西藏交通事业
    最后，目前西藏最主要的还是交通问题。青藏、康藏两大公路通车以后，虽已大大地改变了西藏的交通面貌。但是，只有公路和新辟的航空线，物资的供应和经济的发展还是不够的，我们希望在不久的将来，北京——拉萨间能够通上火车，这不仅有助于巩固国防和高原地区的经济繁荣，并可使藏族同胞能经常来到内地，国内各族人民也容易有机会游览伟大的祖国河山，从而就能够更加认识到生活在社会主义大家庭里的光荣和幸福。
    中国各族人民的大团结万岁！
