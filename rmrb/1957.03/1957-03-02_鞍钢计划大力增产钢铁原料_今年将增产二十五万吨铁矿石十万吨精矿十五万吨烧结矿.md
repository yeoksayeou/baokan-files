Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 1st. The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel's Dagushan, Gongchangling and other iron mines and the sintering plant are tapping potential in all aspects and have formulated a plan to increase production this year by 250,000 tons of iron ore, 100,000 tons of concentrate, and 150,000 tons of sintered ore.

Although Anshan Iron and Steel's planned iron ore production this year will increase by more than 1.3 million tons compared with last year, it still cannot meet the needs of Anshan Iron and Steel's ironmaking and steelmaking production. In order to smelt more iron and steel and support production and construction throughout the country, Anshan Iron and Steel, through discussions on the national plan, actively organized and mobilized the miners to come up with more ways to increase the production of iron and steel raw materials.

As early as January, the Party Committee of Dagushan Iron Mine organized technical cadres to go deep into the mining sites and workshops to tap potential, and clarified that the key to the entire mine was to improve blasting efficiency, strengthen equipment maintenance, and increase effective working days. After four professional technical meetings, it was decided to promote a series of advanced Soviet experiences such as instantaneous interval blasting and bottom rock expansion methods; and to adopt many rationalization proposals put forward by veteran workers such as Wang Lianfu to solve problems such as broken drill bits in drilling machines. In terms of increasing effective working days, it was decided to take measures such as thickening the crusher's shell and implementing pre-assembly, so that the number of crusher repairs would be reduced by two, and the repair time for each repair would be shortened from five days to three days, which would increase the number of working days by eighteen days throughout the year, creating conditions for the mine to increase iron ore production by 200,000 tons.

Gongchangling Iron Mine is striving to increase the country's iron ore production by 50,000 tons by opening up eleven new working faces and vigorously promoting various advanced experiences. Employees of the sintering plant put forward more than 1,600 suggestions for improving equipment and operating methods, creating conditions for increasing the production of 150,000 tons of sintered ore and 50,000 tons of concentrate.

    鞍钢计划大力增产钢铁原料
    今年将增产二十五万吨铁矿石十万吨精矿十五万吨烧结矿
    新华社鞍山1日电  鞍钢大孤山、弓长岭等铁矿和烧结总厂的职工们挖掘各方面的潜力，订出在今年增产二十五万吨铁矿石、十万吨精矿、十五万吨烧结矿的计划。
    鞍钢今年计划生产的铁矿石虽然比去年增加了一百三十多万吨，但是仍然不能满足鞍钢炼铁、炼钢生产的需要。鞍钢为了冶炼更多的钢铁，支援全国各地的生产建设，通过讨论国家计划，积极组织和发动矿工们，想出更多的办法来增产钢铁原料。
    中共大孤山铁矿党委会早在1月份就组织技术干部，深入采矿现场和各车间挖掘潜力，并且明确了全矿的关键问题在于提高爆破效率，加强设备维护和提高有效工作日。经过四次专业技术会议研究，确定推广瞬时间隔爆破法、岩底扩大法等一系列的苏联先进经验；采纳老工人王连福等提出的解决穿孔机断钎子等许多合理化建议。在提高有效工作日方面，决定采取加厚破碎机脱皮和实行预装配等措施，使检修破碎机的次数减少两次，每次检修时间由五天缩短到三天，全年能增加十八个工作日，为全矿增产二十万吨铁矿石创造了条件。
    弓长岭铁矿通过开辟十一个新掌子、大力推广各种先进经验等办法，争取给国家增产五万吨铁矿石。烧结总厂职工提出一千六百多项改进设备和操作方法等建议，为增产十五万吨烧结矿和五万吨精矿创造了条件。
