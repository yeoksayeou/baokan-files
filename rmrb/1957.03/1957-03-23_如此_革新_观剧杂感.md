　　Such "Innovation"
　　--Thoughts on Watching a Play
　　Wang Dongqing
　　Innovation is a good thing.

　　Whether it is in social life systems, or in thought and art, there must be constant innovation in order to have continuous development and progress. Innovation in culture and art, although it went through the era of "Down with the Confucius Shop," still preserved and developed those essences beneficial to the people. It can be seen that innovation in culture and art requires a hundred times more meticulousness, and cannot be done crudely.

    But in fact, there are many crude "innovators." Not to mention anything else, this "spirit of innovation" is often reflected in clothing. For example, the "innovation" in the costume of Princess Rakshasi in the Beijing Chunqiu Peking Opera Troupe's performance of "Sun Wukong Steals the Banana Fan Three Times" is like this.

    Princess Rakshasi wore a silver-like mesh hairnet, a blue soft satin dress (blouse) with sequins, and a golden shimmering phoenix-tail-style cloak behind her. If it were not for the limitations of the actor's physical condition, she would have looked like a beautiful Western European noblewoman. At the same time, the maid Servant of Heaven, who appeared with Princess Rakshasi, had her hair in a bun, with flowers inserted, earrings, and wearing loose clothes with ancient patterns, immediately brought the audience into the ancient historical context. In the same scene, the same era and environment, but two characters with different personalities and status, wore such different clothes, hundreds of years apart, which really made the audience dazzled and dared not imagine. If Princess Rakshasi's costumes continue to be "innovated" in this way with the development of the times, in another ten years, perhaps Princess Rakshasi will no longer dance with red ribbons like the girls in the dance troupe when entertaining the Bull Demon King, but will dance ballet or other modern dances. The Princess Rakshasi in the Ming Dynasty's mythological novel "Journey to the West," with her head wrapped in a "floral handkerchief," wearing a "embroidered cloud robe," and holding a twelve-foot-long "banana fan," may be completely named after a certain lady. At that time, the marks on Sun Wukong's face may be "innovated" away, and he may be draped in a "fashionable" costume. If this "innovation" continues, the "Journey to the West," which is full of romanticism and loved by the broad masses of people, will really "travel west" under the slaughter of "innovators."

    Faced with such "innovation," I would rather be a "retro" "conservative." Because I firmly believe that Princess Rakshasi's classical costumes, which are full of mythological colors, are definitely not dross, and dancing with red ribbons is not more appropriate than dancing with water sleeves, ribbons, or banana fans. Why is it necessary to satisfy the momentary "eye blessing" of some audiences cheaply with the subjective intentions and preferences of the director and actors, at the expense of the spirit of anti-historicism?

    In order to respect the hard work of predecessors in artistic creation, please these "innovators" be merciful!

　　如此“革新”
　　——观剧杂感
　　王冬青
　  革新是件好事。
　　无论是社会生活制度或思想、艺术，都需有不断的革新，才能有不断的发展和进步。文化艺术方面的革新，虽经过“打倒孔家店”的时代，但那些于人民有利的精华，却仍得到保存和发展。可见在文化艺术方面的革新需要百倍的细致，来不得任何粗野。
    但事实上，粗暴的“革新”家却大有人在。别的不说，就在服饰上也往往体现了这种“革新”精神。比如北京的春秋京剧团演出“孙悟空三盗芭蕉扇”一剧中，罗刹公主服饰的“革新”，就是如此。
    罗刹公主头戴似银质的网发套，身穿蓝软缎镶着亮片的连衣裙（布拉吉），身后披着金黄闪光凤尾式的斗篷。要不是演员生理条件所限，真有些像西欧美丽的贵妇人了。而与罗刹公主同时出场的侍女赛天仙，梳着发髻，插着花，戴着耳环，穿着宽大的、有着古老花纹的衣服，一下就把观众带到古老的历史情境中去了。同场出现的同一个时代、环境，只是性格、地位有异的两个人物，却穿着如此不同、相距几百年的服饰，真使观众眼花缭乱，不敢想像。罗刹公主的服饰，如果这样随着时代的发展不断“革新”下去，再过十年，也许罗刹公主在娱乐牛魔王时，不再是像今天舞蹈团的女孩子一样舞红绸舞，而是跳芭蕾舞或别的现代舞了。明朝的神魔小说“西游记”中头裹“团花手帕”、身着“纳锦云袍”、手拿一丈二尺长短的“芭蕉扇子”的罗刹公主，可能完全以某某女士而命名了。那时孙悟空脸上的标记也许会被“革”去，而披起一身“时髦”的服装。如此“革新”下去，那富有浪漫主义色彩而为广大人民喜闻乐见的“西游记”，在“革新”家的宰割下，会真的“西游”了。
    面对着这样的“革新”，我宁愿作一个“复古”的“保守”者。因为我坚决相信，罗刹公主那身富有神魔色彩的古典服饰，决不属于糟粕，舞红绸舞也并不比舞水袖、舞飘带或芭蕉扇恰当。何必要以导演、演员的主观意图和爱好，不惜以反历史主义的精神，廉价地去饱部分观众瞬间的“眼福”呢？
    为了尊重前人在艺术创造上的艰苦劳动，请这些“革新”家们手下留情！
