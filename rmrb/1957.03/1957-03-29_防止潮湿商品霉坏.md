　　Preventing Mold Spoilage of Damp Goods
Last autumn, Hebei Province experienced widespread flooding, and the ground moisture in most areas was high. The harvesting period for crops was delayed. As a result, the oil materials, especially peanuts, taken in by oil companies in various places generally had a higher natural moisture content than in previous years. In individual counties of Tangshan Prefecture, the moisture content of some peanuts was over 20%, more than double the safe moisture content (i.e., critical moisture content) of 9%.

This spring, some of the damp goods in some places have already begun to mold and spoil. The Baoding Oil Mill and Baoji Oil Mill have had more than 3,000 jin of stored peanuts go bad due to mold. These incidents should serve as a warning to us.

　  防止潮湿商品霉坏
    去年秋天，河北省雨多成灾，大部地区地气潮湿，农作物收获期推迟，因而各地油脂公司收进的油料，特别是花生，所含自然水份一般都比往年大。唐山专区个别县份，有的花生水份竟在20％以上，超过安全水份（即临界水份）9％的一倍还多。
    今年入春，有些地方的潮货已经发生霉坏。保定制油厂和保记油厂所存花生米霉坏了三千多斤。这些事故都给我们敲起了警钟。
