Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd dispatch from Washington: US government officials said on March 1st that as soon as Israeli troops withdraw from the Gaza Strip, the United States will immediately force Egypt to accept a "temporary plan" for the management of the Suez Canal.

This "temporary plan" stipulates that after the Suez Canal is opened, ships passing through the canal will pay canal tolls to the World Bank or directly to the United Nations. Half of it will be given to Egypt, and the other half will be frozen until a "permanent settlement" of the "permanent management" of the Suez Canal is achieved. It is reported that the United States, Britain, France, and Norway have recommended this "temporary plan" through the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd dispatch from the Israeli-controlled area of Jerusalem: The Israeli government decided on the evening of the 2nd to postpone the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gulf of Aqaba and the Gaza Strip.

Western news agency reports said that Israel, after just announcing its decision to withdraw its troops, suddenly took delaying action at the last minute because it wanted the United States to provide clearer "guarantees" on certain conditions for its withdrawal. The Israeli radio station in Jerusalem stated on the 2nd that although the Israeli Foreign Minister had announced at the United Nations General Assembly that he was prepared to withdraw troops, whether Israel is now willing to withdraw from Egypt depends on the "further clarification" of the US attitude.

    美国一味无视埃及主权
    想强迫埃及接受侵犯运河的“临时计划”
    以色列无赖变卦宣布延迟撤军
    据新华社3日讯  华盛顿消息：美国政府官员1日说，一俟以色列军队撤出加沙地带，美国将立即迫使埃及接受一项管理苏伊士运河的“临时计划”。
    这项“临时计划”规定，在苏伊士运河开放以后，通过运河的船只将把运河通行费交给世界银行，或者直接交给联合国。其中的一半交给埃及，其他一半冻结起来，等到对苏伊士运河的“永久管理”“取得最后解决”以后再作处理。有消息说，美国、英国、法国和挪威已经通过联合国建议这个“临时计划”。
    据新华社3日讯  耶路撒冷以色列区消息：以色列政府在2日晚上决定延迟采取以色列军队撤出亚喀巴湾和加沙地区的行动。
    西方通讯社的消息说，以色列在刚刚宣布决定撤军之后，忽然又在最后一分钟采取拖延行动，是因为它还要美国对它撤军的某些条件提出更明确的“保证”。耶路撒冷的以色列电台2日表示，尽管以色列外交部长已经在联合国大会宣布准备撤军，但是现在以色列是否愿意撤出埃及，还有赖于美国的态度的“进一步澄清”。
