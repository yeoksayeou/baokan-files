Kunming dispatch from our newspaper: In December 1956 and January 1957, wild elephant herds numbering twenty to thirty were discovered in the forests of Zhongsan Village in Xiaomengyang and the Guangping area of Xishuangbanna. This is a noteworthy discovery. Before this, there were no true scientific records of elephants in China. These elephants are quite different from wild elephants found in India and Africa, possessing a fierce nature and actively attacking other animals. Due to the difficulty of approaching the elephant herds, their life habits and species are currently unclear. Scientific researchers have repeatedly attempted to photograph the wild elephant herds through telescopes to record their lives, but have not yet succeeded due to the herds' fierce nature. Currently, based on introductions from Dai people, scientific researchers are starting by studying the elephants' footprints and the state of the trees knocked down along the elephants' paths, in order to understand the activity patterns of the wild elephant herds in order to capture them.

    云南发现野生象群
    本报昆明电  1956年12月和1957年1月，先后两次在西双版纳小勐养的中伞寨子与广平地带的大森林中发现为数二十到三十多支的野生象群。这是一个值得注意的发现。在此以前，中国是否产象，尚无真正的科学记载。这种象同印度、非洲所产生的野象迥然不同，性质凶猛，主动攻击其他动物。关于这些野生象群的生活习性、种属问题，由于人们不敢接近象群，现在还不清楚。科学研究工作者曾屡次采用在望远镜内拍照的方法以记录野生象群的生活状况，但因象群来势凶猛，至今尚未成功。目前，科学研究工作者根据傣族人士的介绍，从研究象的脚印以及象群所过之处沿途树木被击倒的状况等两方面着手，摸清野生象群的活动规律，以便捕获。 （寇治通）
