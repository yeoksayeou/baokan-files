Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 13th -- The D伙房 Reservoir Engineering Bureau has postponed engineering projects that can be delayed and reduced engineering overhead, so that this year's investment has been cut by nearly one-third, yet it can still ensure that the reservoir can block floods and store water during the flood season this year according to the original plan.

    After the dam of the D伙房 Reservoir was closed in October last year, the reservoir has initially formed. Before the flood season this year, the dam must be built to a certain height to block the flood. In order to increase production and practice economy, the state reduced the investment in the D伙房 Reservoir this year from 81 million yuan to 57 million yuan, while still requiring the reservoir project to be able to block and store floods that occur once every two hundred years before the flood season. Therefore, the Reservoir Engineering Bureau re-examined and modified the construction design, concentrating the investment on the main project, the dam. The two gate hoist towers at the inlet and outlet of the aqueduct were originally scheduled to be completed this year, but now they are changed to complete the inlet part first this year, which can also achieve the purpose of controlling the water volume. The spillway was originally scheduled to be excavated this year and lined with reinforced concrete. However, this project is excavated on the mountain rock layer, and it can be used to discharge floodwater temporarily without lining. In this way, it was decided to complete only the excavation project and a small part of the necessary lining project within the year. The dam was originally planned to be built to a height of 128 meters above sea level this year, but now it is decided to reduce it by four meters this year without affecting flood control during the flood season.

    Leading cadres of the Reservoir Engineering Bureau also went deep into the grassroots to investigate and compressed engineering overhead five times in succession. This is mainly to balance the construction intensity of the whole year's project, cut off the mechanical equipment, instruments, and materials that can be used or not used, further compress the equipment and materials that must be purchased, and further tap the potential of equipment utilization and inventory assets in mobilizing employees to review equipment and material purchase plans. As a result, this year's steel demand decreased from 6,000 tons to 2,000 tons, 300 fewer mine cars were used, and the demand for steel rails, locomotives, steel bars, and cement was also greatly reduced. In addition, the Reservoir Engineering Bureau is also starting to adjust the organizational structure and try to improve labor productivity, which can also save a lot of funds.

### 大伙房水库今年投资削减三分之一仍能拦洪蓄水

    大伙房水库今年投资削减三分之一仍能拦洪蓄水
    新华社抚顺13日电  大伙房水库工程局推迟可以缓修的工程项目，压缩工程间接费用，使今年投资削减近三分之一，仍能保证按原计划使水库在今年汛期拦洪蓄水。
    大伙房水库的拦河大坝在去年10月合龙以后，水库已经初步形成。今年汛期前，必须把大坝修到一定的高度，才能拦住洪水。为了增产节约，国家把大伙房水库今年的投资由八千一百万元削减到五千七百万元，而仍要求在汛期前把水库工程做到能拦蓄两百年一遇的洪水。因此水库工程局重新审查和修改施工设计，使投资集中地用在主体工程拦河大坝上。输水道进口和出口的两个闸门启闭塔原定今年全部修好，现在改为今年先修进口部分，也可以达到控制水量的目的。溢洪道原定在今年凿好，并且用钢筋水泥衬砌。但是，这个工程是在山间岩层上开凿的，暂时不衬砌也可以用来排泄洪水。这样就决定年内只作完开凿工程和一小部分必须的衬砌工程。拦河大坝今年原计划修筑到海拔一百二十八公尺的高度，现在决定在不影响汛期拦洪的情况下，今年少修四公尺。
    水库工程局的领导干部还深入基层摸底，先后五次压缩了工程间接费用。这主要是平衡全年工程的施工强度，把可用可不用的机械设备、仪表、材料等削去，把必须购进的设备和材料进一步压缩，以及在发动职工审查设备、材料购买计划中，进一步挖掘了设备利用率和库存资财的潜力。结果，今年的钢材需用量由六千吨降到两千吨，少用矿车三百台，钢轨、机车、钢筋、水泥的需用量也都大大降低。此外，水库工程局还着手调整组织机构，设法提高劳动生产率，也可以节省不少资金。
