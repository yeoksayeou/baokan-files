    Changing the Situation Where "Flesh" and "Bone" are Incompatible
　　Liu Wenwei Discusses the Relationship Between Industrial Construction and Urban Construction in Shaanxi Province
    I fully endorse the reports of Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and I fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the Standing Committee of the CPPCC.
    Now, I would like to share some opinions on the relationship between industrial construction and urban construction.
    Before liberation, Shaanxi Province was a region with a very weak industrial base and relatively backward economy and culture. After liberation, especially since the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, large-scale industrial construction has been carried out in the Shaanxi region. On the vast Guanzhong Plain, several new industrial cities have been or are about to be built successively, in addition to Xi'an City. In recent years, the development of industrial construction in the Shaanxi region has been rapid. At the same time, some new problems have emerged that need to be gradually resolved. Here, I will take Xi'an City as an example to discuss the relationship between industrial construction and urban construction.
    According to the state's first Five-Year Plan, the state's investment in industrial, cultural, and educational construction in Xi'an City is very large. Many large-scale factories and institutions of higher learning are being built in Xi'an City. There are more than 30 industrial construction units above the quota alone, and more than ten university and college institutions. In 1956, the total industrial output value was 776% of that in 1949. With the rapid development of industrial construction, the urban scale has expanded unprecedentedly. The area of the new urban area is about four times that of the old urban area, and the completed construction area is equivalent to 1.45 times the original construction area. The urban population has increased dramatically, reaching 224% of that in 1949 in 1956. The growth of social purchasing power is also very rapid, with social purchasing power in 1956 increasing by 99% compared to 1952. From this, it can be seen that all aspects of construction in Xi'an City have made great progress in recent years. This is due to the correct leadership of the Central Committee, the strong support from all parts of the country, especially the joint efforts and hard work of workers transferred from East China and other places and local workers, and the active support of farmers throughout the province.
    In order to cooperate with the construction of large-scale industries, in recent years, we have overcome many difficulties and done a lot of work in urban construction, local industries, transportation, culture and education, material supply, and other service industries. All aspects have developed greatly year by year. However, it still cannot keep up with the needs of large-scale industrial construction. Especially since the second half of 1956, tense situations have emerged in many aspects, that is to say, a contradiction has occurred where the "flesh" is not adapted to the "bone." For example, Xi'an City did not have a good road before liberation. Now, the length of newly built roads is equivalent to 290% of the original road length, some of which are high-grade road surfaces. However, many newly built factories and schools still do not have roads paved between them and the roads. Most of the roads in the new urban area are low-grade road surfaces, the so-called "dusty roads when it's sunny, muddy roads when it rains." At the beginning of liberation, the city had a total of six usable buses. Now there are ninety-eight buses. Although the factory and enterprise vacation time has been changed to rotation, and some trucks have been drawn from provincial and municipal agencies to make up for the shortage, when there are holidays, many people often line up in one place to wait for the bus. Xi'an City had no tap water equipment or sewer system in the past. Now about half of the city's population can drink tap water, and more than 130 kilometers of drainage pipes have been renovated and newly built. Even so, the industrial water supply and drainage problems have not been properly resolved, which seriously affects industrial production and public health. Although the area of newly built residential buildings accounts for 45.5% of the new construction area, and some temporary felt sheds and thatched sheds have been set up, and some factory leaders have even vacated houses for workers to live in, housing is still very scarce. Although the development of education is very rapid, in 1956 the number of students in universities, middle schools, and primary schools was 364% of that in 1949, of which the number of university students was ten times that of 1949. However, this year many primary and junior high school graduates still cannot go on to higher education, and many school-age children cannot enroll. Although medical and health undertakings have also made great progress, in 1956 the number of various medical institutions was 990% of that in 1949, and the number of hospital beds was 560% of that in 1949. However, many patients still cannot be hospitalized for treatment. Women giving birth can only stay in the hospital for three days after delivery, except for first births and difficult births. In terms of cultural undertakings, although some new cinemas and theaters have been built, the number of cinema and theater audiences in the city in 1956 was five times that of 1949. However, it still cannot meet the needs of the vast number of workers and students in the new urban area. Some other service industries are also relatively strained.
    The situation in Xi'an City is like this, and other counties, towns, and newly built industrial areas in Guanzhong are even more strained than Xi'an City. These situations on the one hand show that our construction undertakings and the people's purchasing power are developing and increasing very rapidly, and on the other hand also show that the "flesh" is not adapted to the "bone."
    Why is there this tense situation? As far as we feel, the main reasons are: Xi'an and other emerging industrial cities have developed rapidly in industry, but the foundation of the original old cities is very poor. Some factories and mines started from scratch, and there were no old cities to use at all; we have no experience in how to correctly handle the proportional relationship between "flesh" and "bone," and we are still exploring and moving forward. We pay more attention to "bone" and less attention to "flesh." Urban planning has not kept pace with industrial construction. We are building while planning, and some aspects are not very reasonable; in addition, the blind flow of rural population to cities has further increased the urban tension. This has created a situation where all aspects are developing rapidly, but in comparison, the "bone" is growing very fast, while the "flesh" is growing relatively slowly. During the large-scale construction period of emerging industrial cities, this kind of incompatibility is difficult to avoid, but I believe that on the basis of production and construction, this situation can definitely be gradually changed.
    In order to change this situation, I think it is necessary to work in many ways. First, solve some of the currently urgent problems as much as possible (such as the water supply and drainage and road problems that affect production). Second, try every means to increase production and practice economy, and resolutely implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily. We should tap all potentials, make full use of existing buildings and equipment, and appropriately stipulate various standards for municipal construction and non-productive construction in factories and enterprises based on China's current production and living standards and the principle of being both applicable and economical. Don't seek novelty and size too much, don't pay too much attention to long-term plans, and don't rush to demand everything. At the same time, we must also conduct ideological education on building the country diligently and thriftily and working hard among all cadres and the people. Third, it is hoped that the relevant departments of the Central Committee and the relevant provinces and cities will study the proportional relationship between "flesh" and "bone" in the construction of emerging industrial cities and new industrial and mining areas, that is, the investment ratio between large-scale industrial construction and municipal construction, based on the experience of the past few years, and appropriately resolve it; the proportion of using old city houses should also be revised according to different situations in various places; it is also hoped that there will be a clear stipulation on which department should invest in the road, shop, and school projects in the factory area. Fourth, it is hoped that the Central Committee, especially governments at all levels, will take effective measures to appropriately restrict the phenomenon of the blind flow of agricultural population to cities.
    It is obvious that if we are to build our country from a very backward agricultural country into a great socialist industrialized country in three Five-Year Plans or a little more time, as mentioned above, we will encounter many difficulties. But these are all difficulties that arise in the process of making great achievements in industrial construction, and they are all difficulties in rapid development and leaps forward. As long as we earnestly implement the policy of "overall planning and appropriate arrangements," resolutely implement the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, and carry forward the glorious tradition of diligence and thrift and hard work, any difficulties can definitely be gradually overcome. The broad masses of workers in our Shaanxi region are making every effort to overcome all difficulties and further achieve greater achievements in industrial construction and various construction undertakings in the Shaanxi region.

    改变“肉”与“骨头”不相适应的情况
　　刘文蔚谈陕西省工业建设和城市建设的关系问题
    我完全拥护毛主席、周总理和李富春副总理的报告，完全同意陈叔通副主席关于政协常务委员会的工作报告。
    现在我就工业建设和城市建设等的关系问题讲一点意见。
    陕西省解放前是一个工业基础非常薄弱、经济文化比较落后的地区。解放以后，特别是国家第一个五年计划开始实行以来，陕西地区进行了大规模的工业建设。在辽阔的关中平原上，除西安市外，好几个新的工业城市已经和即将陆续兴建起来。几年来，陕西地区工业建设的发展很快，同时，也出现了一些新的问题，需要逐步加以解决。这里我以西安市为例，说一下工业建设和城市建设等的关系问题。
    根据国家第一个五年计划，国家在西安市的工业和文化教育建设的投资是很大的，许多大型的工厂和高等学校在西安市兴建，仅限额以上的工业建设单位就有三十多个，大学专科院校就有十余所。1956年工业总产值为1949年的776％。随着工业建设的迅速发展，城市规模空前扩大，新市区的面积约等于旧市区的四倍，已经建成的建筑面积相当于原有建筑面积的一点四五倍。城市人口急剧增加，1956年为1949年的224％。社会购买力增长也很快，1956年社会购买力较1952年增长99％。由此可见，几年来西安市各方面的建设都有了很大的发展。这是由于中央的正确领导，全国各地的大力支援，特别是从华东等地调来的职工和本省职工共同努力、艰苦奋斗，以及全省农民积极支援而取得的成就。
    为了配合大型工业的建设，几年来，我们在城市建设、地方工业、交通运输、文化教育、物资供应、以及其他各项服务事业方面，克服了许多困难，做了许多工作，各个方面逐年都有很大的发展，但是，仍然赶不上大型工业建设的需要。尤其是1956年下半年以来，在许多方面都出现了紧张情况，也就是说，发生了“肉”跟“骨头”不相适应的矛盾。例如西安市解放前没有一条好马路，现在新建道路长度相当于原有道路长度的290％，其中有一部分是高级路面，但是许多新建的工厂、学校至马路之间仍然没有铺设马路，新市区的道路大都是低级路面，所谓“天晴扬灰路，下雨水泥路”。初解放的时候，全市共有六辆能用的公共汽车，现在共有九十八辆公共汽车，虽然把工厂企业休假时间改为轮换休假，并由省市机关抽出一部分卡车以补不足，但是，遇到假日，一个地方往往有很多人排队等车。西安市过去没有自来水设备，没有下水道系统，现在全市约有一半人口能饮用自来水，同时整修和新修了一百三十多公里排水管道，虽然如此，工业供水、排水问题仍未得到妥善解决，严重的影响了工业生产和公共卫生。新建住宅面积虽然占新的建筑面积的45.5％，并且临时搭起一些牛毛毡棚和草棚，有些工厂领导人员还腾出房子让职工居住，但是房子仍很缺乏。教育事业的发展虽然很快，1956年大、中、小学在校人数为1949年的364％，其中大学生为1949年的十倍，但是今年仍有许多小学和初中毕业学生不能升学，不少的学龄儿童不能入学。医药卫生事业虽然也有很大的发展，1956年各种医疗机构为1949年的990％，病床为1949年的560％。但是，仍有许多病人不能住院治疗，妇女生小孩，除初产、难产的以外，一般只能在医院住三天就得出院。文化事业方面，虽然新建了一些影剧院，1956年全市影剧院观众人次为1949年的五倍。但是，仍然不能适应新市区的广大职工、学生的需要。其他有一些服务事业也是比较紧张的。
    西安市的情况如此，关中其他县、镇、新建工业区比西安市更紧张。这些情况一方面说明我们的建设事业和人民的购买能力发展和提高的很快，另一方面也说明“肉”跟“骨头”的不相适应。
    为什么会出现这些紧张情况呢？就我们所感觉到的，主要是：西安等新兴工业城市，工业发展很快，但原来旧城市的基础很差，有些厂矿还是平地起家，根本没有旧城市可利用；我们对如何正确地处理“肉”和“骨头”的比例关系没有经验，还在摸索前进，对“骨头”注意的较多，对“肉”注意的较少，城市规划没有走在工业建设的前面，边建设，边规划，某些方面有些不很合理；加之农村人口盲目的向城市流转，更增加了城市紧张情况。这样就形成各方面虽然都发展的很快，但相形之下，“骨头”长的很快，而“肉”长得就嫌慢了一些的情况。新兴的工业城市在进行大规模的建设期间，这种不相适应的情况是很难避免的，但我认为在生产建设的基础上，这种情况是一定能够逐步加以改变的。
    为了改变这种情况，我觉得需要从多方面进行工作。第一，尽可能地解决一些目前急需解决的问题（例如影响生产的上下水和道路问题）。第二，想尽一切办法增产节约，坚决贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业的方针，应当挖掘一切潜力，充分利用现有的建筑和设备，并对市政建设和工厂企业中的非生产性建设的各种标准，根据我国当前生产、生活水平，和既适用又节约的原则，加以适当规定，不要过于求新求大，过于讲究百年大计，也不要急于要求样样俱全，应有尽有。同时，还要向全体干部和人民进行勤俭建国、艰苦奋斗的思想教育。第三，希望中央有关部门和有关省、市对新兴工业城市和新建工矿区建设中“肉”和“骨头”的比例关系，也就是大工业建设和市政建设的投资比例问题，根据这几年的经验，加以研究，适当解决；对利用旧城市房屋的比例，也应根据各地不同情况予以修改；对厂区的道路、商店、学校项目应归那个部门投资也望有一明确规定。第四，希望中央，特别是各级政府，采取有效措施，对农业人口盲目流向城市的现象加以适当限制。
    很明显，要把我国由一个十分落后的农业国在三个五年计划或更多一点的时间内建成一个伟大的社会主义的工业化的国家，如上所述，我们是会遇到许多困难的，但都是在工业建设取得重大成就的过程中所产生的困难，都是迅速发展和飞跃前进中的困难，只要我们切实执行“统筹兼顾、适当安排”的方针，坚决贯彻增加生产、厉行节约的精神，发扬克勤克俭、艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，任何困难都是一定能够逐渐克服的。我们陕西地区的广大职工正在千方百计地为克服一切困难，使陕西地区的工业建设和各项建设事业进一步取得更大的成绩而努力。
