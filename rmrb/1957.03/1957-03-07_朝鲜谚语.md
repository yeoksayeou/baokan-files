Korean Proverbs

    Mount Tai's height is known throughout the world,
    Yet it stands beneath the vast sky;
    People do not climb it,
    But only look up at the peak and complain that Mount Tai is too high.
                    ＊
    Only by wading through the river,
    Can you know the depth of the water;
    Only by spending a long time together,
    Can you understand the bottom of a person's heart.
                    ＊
    If you chatter and talk too much,
    Useful words will be few;
    If you are just busy and bustling,
    The good deeds done will not be many.

    朝鲜谚语
    泰山之高扬名天下，
    却屹立在苍空下面；
    人们并不去攀登它，
    只仰望着山顶埋怨泰山高。
                    ＊
    只有趟过河水，
    才能知道水的深浅；
    只有长期相处，
    才能了解人的心底。
                    ＊
    如果唠唠叨叨话多，
    有用的话便少；
    如果只是忙忙碌碌，
    做出的好事并不多。
