Women Active on the Sports Field
    Young Women's Gymnastics Team

    Recently, at the Shichahai Sports Hall, I once again watched the training activities of China's women's gymnastics team. On the balance beam, which is less than four inches wide, they were practicing handsprings, flying forward rolls, and other extremely difficult movements. The coach told me that these movements were new to them and that they were working hard to prepare for the upcoming competitions with the gymnastics teams from Czechoslovakia and North Korea, hoping to once again win honor for the motherland.

    This women's gymnastics team currently has eleven members, with an average age of only nineteen. Eight of them have already earned the glorious title of Master of Sports. When China's women's gymnastics team was first formed in 1955 to participate in the World Youth Festival, many members could only perform simple movements in artistic gymnastics, and only a few could do relatively complex movements on the balance beam and uneven bars. In the short span of less than two years, they have been working hard and consistently, and their performance has improved rapidly. Team leader Chen Fengping told me about one incident: team member Chen Xiaozhang injured her waist during practice, and her knees were swollen with blood, making it painful to walk. However, this tenacious girl gritted her teeth, pretended nothing was wrong, and continued to perform various movements such as rolls and jumps, until the coach finally discovered it and asked her to see a doctor. Guo Keyu initially had poor flexibility, and some movements did not have an aesthetically pleasing quality. She developed a training plan and practiced dancing and flexibility exercises in front of the mirror repeatedly every day. This sixteen-year-old girl finally overcame her lack of flexibility and surpassed the famous Chen Xiaozhang, Qi Yufang, and others to win the women's all-around gymnastics championship in last year's selection competition for China's Olympic team.

    It is because of such tenacious and arduous training that this young gymnastics team has grown rapidly. Last year, when they went abroad to compete in friendly matches with the gymnastics teams of East Germany and Czechoslovakia, Chen Xiaozhang and Lan Yalan's individual all-around scores reached over seventy-two points. This score has reached the level of the most outstanding Soviet Master of Sports in the world.

    Sports Brought Her Happiness

    People may remember that in July 1956, at the Workers' Games of the three major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai held at the Hongkou Stadium in Shanghai, Zhang Manhua, a female employee of the People's Bank of China Head Office, achieved a long jump score of 5.27 meters, breaking the national record for women's long jump at that time. At that time, Zhang Manhua was already thirty-four years old and the mother of two children. Now, she insists on practicing basketball two to three times a week to maintain her strength and agility. Soon, when spring arrives, she will begin regular track and field practice.

    Zhang Manhua loved sports when she was in school, but after getting married, she became isolated from sports. Long-term busy housework, coupled with the suffering of life in the old society, made her body weaken day by day. When she first started working at the People's Bank of China in 1951, she often felt dizzy at work, suffered from insomnia at night, and had to take a few days of sick leave every month. On July 1st of the following year, the People's Bank of China held bank-wide basketball and volleyball games. She participated in the basketball game with the hope of reliving her student days. After this competition, she regained her love for sports. She could often be seen on the sports field.

    Unlike young girls who could rush to the sports field after work, Zhang Manhua had to arrange household chores such as firewood, rice, oil, and salt, and sew and mend clothes for adults and children. However, she had to participate in exercises regularly. Gradually, her mother-in-law and husband began to nag. Although Zhang Manhua had only been participating in exercises for a short time, she already felt much stronger. How could she give up sports? However, household labor was also important. On the one hand, she continued to exercise without interfering with household labor. On the other hand, she patiently explained to her mother-in-law and husband that after exercising, she would no longer feel dizzy and weak like before, and would not be able to do anything. In fact, after getting healthier, she always went home full of energy every day, sewing and washing clothes, helping her mother-in-law tidy up the room, and checking her children's homework. At the bank, due to her abundant energy, her work and studies progressed rapidly. This fact changed her mother-in-law and husband's views, and they gradually tried to be considerate and take care of her.

    Now, whenever she has a competition on Sundays, her mother-in-law and husband bring their two children to the sports field to watch. When she scores a basket, the children happily applaud for their mother. The eleven-year-old eldest daughter, influenced by her mother, has also become a young athlete and won first place in the long jump at the Dongdan District Primary School Games in Beijing last year.

    Female Workers Who Love Exercise

    In the morning, before the sun rises, the female workers of the fine spinning workshop of the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory are already active on the playground. They line up and run gently along the football field for a while, then stand in the middle of the field to do calisthenics. Finally, they divide into small teams and engage in various activities: some run, some play ball, and others jump rope and climb ropes.

    In the afternoon, not long after the dismissal bell rings, they gather on the playground again as if by agreement and do calisthenics to the music. As soon as the music ends, those agile girls grab badminton rackets, basketballs, volleyballs… from the baskets. A variety of sports activities begin again.

    On the playground, I curiously asked them, "Aren't you tired from working after exercising like this?" Everyone said in unison that they were not tired. A girl named Xu Shumei explained, "We get tired at work if we don't exercise. In the past, I didn't exercise, and I was often exhausted before the end of work, feeling dizzy and having blurred vision. The doctor even said I had neurasthenia. But now, production isn't tiring, and I have a good appetite. Everyone says I'm turning into a rice bucket." This made everyone laugh heartily.

    The factory leaders are very concerned about the workers' sports activities and have specially canceled excessive small group meetings to make time for everyone to exercise. The trade union has also added many new sports equipment.

    Over the past year, the female workers of the fine spinning workshop have been exercising without interruption, regardless of the weather. When it is windy or snowy, everyone spreads mats indoors and practices various mat exercises. Regular exercise has made everyone healthy, and fewer and fewer people are getting sick. The workshop attendance rate has increased from 80% in the past to more than 90% now. Wang Xiuyun, who used to take a lot of sick leave, not only doesn't take sick leave anymore but has also gained seven pounds.

    活跃在运动场上的妇女们
    年轻的女子体操队
    最近，在什刹海体育馆内，我又一次看到了我国女子体操队的锻炼活动：在不到四寸宽的平衡木上，她们正在练习倾手翻、鱼跃前滚翻等难度极高的动作。教练告诉我说：这些动作都是她们过去不会做的新动作，为了准备同来我国访问的捷克斯洛伐克和朝鲜体操队的比赛，她们正在努力练习，准备再一次为祖国争取荣誉。
    这个女子体操队现在有十一个人，她们的平均年龄只有十九岁，已经有八个人获得了运动健将的光荣称号。1955年我国的女子体操队为参加世界青年联欢节刚刚组成的时候，很多队员还只能做竞技体操中的一些简单动作，只有个别队员才能做平衡木、高低杠上的一些比较复杂的动作。在短短的不到两年的时间内，她们顽强地、坚持不断地锻炼着，成绩飞跃提高了。领队陈凤平告诉我这样一件事：队员陈孝彰的腰在练习时受了伤，膝盖也充血肿了起来，走路时疼得厉害。可是这个顽强的姑娘咬着牙，装着若无其事的样子，照常进行滚翻、跳跃等各种动作，直到最后被教练发现后才请医生治疗。队员郭可愚最初由于身体的柔软性差，有些动作不能做得给人以美的感觉。她便订出了锻炼计划，每天对着镜子一遍又一遍地练习舞蹈和柔软体操。这个十六岁的姑娘终于克服了柔软性差的缺点，在去年我国参加奥林匹克运动队的选拔赛中，压倒了著名的陈孝彰、戚玉芳等，取得了女子体操全能冠军。
    就是因为这样顽强、艰苦的锻炼，这支年轻的体操队迅速成长起来。去年出国同民主德国和捷克斯洛伐克体操队作友谊比赛时，陈孝彰和蓝亚兰的个人全能分数达到了七十二分以上。这个分数已经达到了世界上体操最优秀的苏联运动健将级的标准。

    运动给她带来了幸福
    人们还记得，1956年7月，在上海虹口体育场举行的京津沪三大城市工人运动会上，人民银行总行女职员章曼华的跳远成绩达到了五公尺二十七公分，打破了当时的女子跳远全国最高纪录。那时章曼华已经有三十四岁而且是两个孩子的妈妈。现在，她坚持每星期两次到三次的篮球练习，以保持体力和身体的灵敏。不久春暖花开时，她就要开始经常的田径练习了。
    章曼华过去在学校念书的时候很喜爱运动，可是结了婚以后就和运动隔绝了。长时期的繁忙的家务操劳，再加上旧社会的生活煎熬，使她的身体一天天地衰弱下去。1951年她刚进入人民银行工作时，上班经常头昏眼花，晚上老是失眠，每月总要因病请几天假。第二年的7月1日，人民银行举办了全行的篮、排球比赛，她抱着再重温一下学生时代的生活的心情，参加了篮球比赛。这次比赛以后，她又恢复了对体育运动的喜爱。运动场上经常有她的踪影。
    章曼华不能像年轻姑娘那样，下班后一扭身便跑向运动场，家中柴米油盐要她安排，大人、孩子的衣服要她缝补。她却要经常参加锻炼，渐渐地婆婆，丈夫唠叨起来了。章曼华参加锻炼虽然时间还不久，自己已经感觉到身体健壮多了，她怎能放弃体育运动呢？但是家务劳动也是重要的事情。她一面在不妨碍家务劳动的情况下继续锻炼，一面耐心地向婆婆丈夫解释说：身体锻炼好了，回到家里就再也不像过去那样头昏眼花、四肢无力，以至不能做任何事情。事实也正是这样，身体好起来以后，她每天回家总是生气勃勃地缝洗衣服，抢着帮助婆婆整理房间，检查孩子们的功课。在银行里，由于精力充沛，工作和学习都进步很快。这个事实使她的婆婆、丈夫改变了看法，渐渐地尽量体贴她照顾她了。
    现在每逢星期日她有比赛时，婆婆、丈夫便带两个孩子到运动场上观看，她投进一个球，孩子就高兴地为妈妈鼓掌。十一岁的大女儿，在妈妈的影响下也成了一名少年运动员，去年在北京市东单区小学运动会上还得了跳远第一名。

    喜爱锻炼的女工
    早晨，太阳还没有出来，国营北京第一棉纺织厂细纱车间的女工们就已经活跃在操场上了。她们排成队，沿着足球场轻轻地跑一会，便站在场子中间做广播体操，最后分成一小队、一小队地进行各种各样的活动：有的跑步，有的打球，也有的跳绳和爬绳。
    下午，下班的铃声响过不久，她们又不约而同地走到操场，随着音乐做起广播体操。音乐刚刚完结，那些手脚敏捷的姑娘们就从筐筐里抢走了羽毛球拍子、篮球、排球……。多种多样的体育活动又开始了。
    在操场上我好奇地问她们：“你们这样锻炼上班时不累吗？”大家都异口同声地说不累。一个名叫徐淑美的姑娘解释说：“不锻炼，上班时才累呢。过去我不锻炼，常常不到下班就疲倦了，头又晕眼又花，大夫还说我有神经衰弱症。可是现在呢，生产不累，饭又吃得香，大家都说我快变成饭桶了。”说得所有的人都哈哈地笑起来。
    工厂的领导方面很关怀工人们的体育活动，特地取消了过多的小组碰头会，让出时间给大家进行锻炼。工会还新添置了好些运动器械。
    一年来，细纱车间的女工们不管寒暑，大家总是不间断地进行锻炼。遇到刮风下雪，大家便在屋内铺起垫子，练习各种垫上运动。经常的锻炼，使她们个个身体健康，患病的人越来越少了。车间出勤率由过去的80％增长到现在的90％以上。过去老请病假的王秀云，现在不但不请病假了，体重还增加了七斤。    （毓忠）
