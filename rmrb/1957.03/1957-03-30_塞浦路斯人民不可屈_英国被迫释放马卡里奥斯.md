Xinhua News Agency, London, March 29th: The British government announced on March 28th the release of Archbishop Makarios, leader of the Cypriot national self-determination movement. He was kidnapped by British troops a year ago and imprisoned on the Seychelles Islands on the grounds that he had links with the armed forces of the "Fight for Cyprus" organization, which opposed British rule over Cyprus.

The British government also announced its willingness to issue passports to Colonel Grivas, leader of the "Fight for Cyprus" organization, and other Greek and British members of the organization to leave Cyprus.

At the same time, Colonial Secretary Lennox-Boyd emphasized that there was no question of immediately lifting the state of emergency in Cyprus. Makarios would also not be allowed to return to Cyprus. He reiterated that the government "accepted the offer of the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to mediate in order to reach a settlement of the Cyprus issue."

According to the Colonial Office, Archbishop Makarios issued a statement saying that the United Nations resolution advocating the resumption of negotiations so that the Cyprus issue could be resolved peacefully, democratically and justly in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, was the starting point for the final resolution of the issue. In order to allow negotiations to resume, he "called on the 'Fight for Cyprus' organization to declare an end to all combat operations, provided that the British government simultaneously showed understanding by lifting the current state of emergency."

Makarios' statement also supported the Greek government's position: not to discuss the Cyprus issue within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but to demand the resumption of direct negotiations between the British government and the Cypriots.

　　塞浦路斯人民不可屈
　　英国被迫释放马卡里奥斯
    据新华社伦敦29日电  英国政府3月28日宣布释放塞浦路斯民族自决运动领袖马卡里奥斯大主教。他是在一年前被英国军队绑架和监禁在塞舌耳岛上的，罪名是他同反对英国统治塞浦路斯的“为塞浦路斯而斗争”组织的武装力量有联系。
    英国政府还宣布愿意发给“为塞浦路斯而斗争”组织的领袖格里瓦斯上校和这个组织其他希腊籍和英国籍的成员以离开塞浦路斯的护照。
    同时殖民地大臣伦诺克斯—波伊德强调说，目前根本谈不上立即取消塞浦路斯的紧急状态。马卡里奥斯也不能回到塞浦路斯去。他再次表示，政府“接受了北大西洋公约组织秘书长愿意进行斡旋以使塞浦路斯问题得到和解的建议”。
    据殖民地部说，马卡里奥斯大主教发表的声明说，联合国主张恢复谈判以使塞浦路斯问题根据联合国宪章原则得到和平、民主和公正的解决的决议，是走向这个问题的最后解决的起点。为了使谈判得以恢复，他“呼吁‘为塞浦路斯而斗争组织’宣布终止一切战斗行动，只要英国政府在同时取消目前的紧急状态而表现谅解精神”。
    马卡里奥斯的声明还支持希腊政府的立场：不在北大西洋公约组织内讨论塞浦路斯问题，而要求恢复英国政府和塞浦路斯人之间的直接谈判。
