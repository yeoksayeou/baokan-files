　　In the spring of 1957, the Chinese people welcomed the Czechoslovak government delegation headed by Prime Minister Široký. Since arriving in Beijing on March 9, the distinguished guests have stayed in our country for half a month. During this period, Prime Minister Široký and the delegation met with our national leaders and held talks with each other. They also visited some of China's major cities, factories, farms, scenic spots, historical sites, and cultural institutions, and met with the broad masses of people in various places. All these activities took place in an atmosphere of cordiality, sincerity, friendship, and warmth.

　　The talks between the leaders of the Chinese and Czechoslovak governments have been successfully concluded. The several documents signed yesterday reflect the achievements of the talks. These documents are: the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Czechoslovak Republic, the Joint Statement of the Governments of China and Czechoslovakia, the Agreement on Cultural Cooperation between China and Czechoslovakia, and the Agreement on Health Cooperation between China and Czechoslovakia. The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between China and Czechoslovakia is of particular significance. This is the third state treaty that our country has concluded with socialist countries, following the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation. The treaty solemnly declares that China and Czechoslovakia "will participate in all international actions aimed at ensuring world peace and the security of all peoples and in conformity with the principles of the United Nations Charter in the spirit of sincere cooperation." The treaty also stipulates that the two countries will "consolidate and develop friendly relations and brotherly cooperation on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit." The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between China and Czechoslovakia embodies the firm determination of the two peoples to defend the cause of world peace and promote human progress, and enshrines the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples in treaty form. This treaty is a summary of the rapid development of comprehensive friendly cooperation between the two peoples in recent years, and a new starting point for further developing this relationship in the future. The signing of this treaty and the other two cooperation agreements will be satisfactory and welcome to the people of both China and Czechoslovakia.

　　During the talks, the leaders of the two governments exchanged views on the current international situation and various international issues of common concern to both countries. As reflected in the joint statement of the two governments, China and Czechoslovakia share the same overall assessment of the current international situation and the same views on all major international issues related to world peace. Although the process of easing international tensions was hindered by the imperialist aggressive forces' military attacks on Egypt and subversive activities against Hungary last autumn, the failure of imperialism's aggression on these two fronts has led to a renewed possibility of easing the once-tense international situation. In summarizing the process of repeated struggles between the forces of peace and the forces of war over the past few years, the joint statement of the two governments points out that "the imperialist policy of aggression and war has become increasingly unpopular, and the will and actions of peace-loving countries and peoples are increasingly influencing the development of the international situation, and the general trend in the world is towards relaxation and progress." This correct assessment will powerfully encourage the two peoples to further strive for international security and confidence in cooperation.

　　In the joint statement, both sides expressed their firm opposition to the activities of imperialist forces to revive West German militarism and supported the efforts of the German Democratic Republic to achieve peaceful reunification of Germany. Both sides opposed military blocs established by imperialist countries for the purpose of expansion and aggression, as well as exclusive organizations such as the so-called "European Common Market" and "European Atomic Energy Community." Although the joint statement reiterated the necessity of the continued existence of the Warsaw Treaty, a self-defense organization established to prevent the expansion of German militarist forces and imperialist aggression, it also pointed out that both the Warsaw Treaty and the North Atlantic Treaty should be replaced by a pan-European collective security system. The joint statement supported the efforts of the Korean and Vietnamese peoples for the peaceful reunification of their countries, and expressed sympathy for the peoples of Arab countries and Asian and African countries who are opposing imperialist threats, and are willing to strengthen friendly cooperation with these countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The two governments also fully supported the important proposals recently put forward by the Soviet government on issues such as cooperation among European countries, ensuring the peace and independence of the Middle East countries, and disarmament. China and Czechoslovakia have in the past made active efforts to strive for peace and enhance international cooperation. The consensus reached in the joint statement of this meeting will undoubtedly further enhance the joint cooperation between the two countries in international affairs in the future.

　　In the talks between the two countries, the issue of relations between socialist countries received special attention and emphasis. The two governments reaffirmed their firm support for the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government and will continue to help the Hungarian people overcome the difficulties they are currently encountering. The principles of Marxism-Leninism regarding proletarian internationalism and national equality were once again affirmed as the basis of relations between socialist countries. The two governments also stated that they will "continue to regard safeguarding and strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union as their top international obligation." It must be pointed out that recently, at the Bermuda talks between the US and British leaders, the North Atlantic Treaty was reaffirmed "as the cornerstone of the two countries' Western policy," full of hostility and animosity towards peace-loving socialist countries. This fact and countless past facts prove the importance of strengthening the unity between socialist countries. Therefore, the joint statement of the Chinese and Czechoslovak governments believes that "the close unity and friendly cooperation between socialist countries is the most reliable guarantee for the socialist cause and world peace." Just like the many bilateral talks held between socialist countries in recent times, the talks between the Chinese and Czechoslovak governments and the signing of a series of treaties, agreements and joint statements have also made important contributions to strengthening the unity and cooperation of all countries in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and to safeguarding the cause of world peace.

　　In a few days, the Czechoslovak distinguished guests will leave our country. Although the distinguished guests' stay in our country is not long, and the aspects they have touched upon are not many, the representatives of the Czechoslovak people, who have come from afar, have left a very deep impression among the broad masses of our people. Prime Minister Široký's warm, enthusiastic and cordial speeches, the distinguished guests' contact with the Chinese people, and their valuable opinions on various aspects of our country will all be unforgettable. Through this visit, the hearts of our two peoples are even more intertwined, and we are united more closely. We are deeply convinced that the brotherly friendship between our two peoples will be further developed and carried forward, and our common cause will achieve greater victories.

　　中捷兄弟是一家
    在1957年大地回春的日子里，我国人民迎接了以西罗基总理为首的捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团。贵宾们自从3月9日抵达北京以来，已经在我们的国土上逗留了半个月的光景。在此期间，西罗基总理和代表团会见了我国的国家领导人，并相互进行了会谈。他们还参观访问了我国的一些主要城市、工厂、农庄、名胜古迹和文化机关，并同各地广大的人民群众见了面。所有这一切活动，都是在亲切、诚挚、友好和热烈的气氛中进行的。
    中捷两国政府领导人的会谈已经圆满结束。昨天签字的几个文件反映了这次会谈所获得的成果。这些文件是：中华人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国友好合作条约、中捷两国政府联合声明、中捷文化合作协定和中捷保健合作协定。具有特别重要意义的是中捷友好合作条约。这是继中苏友好同盟互助条约和中德友好合作条约以后，我国同社会主义国家缔结的第三个国家条约。这个条约庄严地宣布，中捷“两国将本着真诚合作的精神，参加一切旨在保障世界和平和各国人民的安全并且同联合国宪章原则相符合的国际行动”。条约同时规定，两国将在“互相尊重主权、互不干涉内政、平等和互利的基础上，巩固和发展友好关系和兄弟般的合作。”中捷友好合作条约体现了两国人民保卫世界和平和促进人类进步的崇高事业的坚定决心，并且把中捷两国人民的兄弟友谊用条约形式固定下来了。这个条约是两国人民这些年来迅速发展的全面友好合作关系的总结，也是今后进一步发展这种关系的新的起点。这个条约和其他两个合作协定的签订，将使中捷两国人民感到满意和欢迎。
    会谈过程中，两国政府领导人就目前国际形势和两国所共同关心的各种国际问题交换了意见。正如两国政府联合声明所反映的，中捷两国对于当前国际局势的总的估计以及对一切有关世界和平的重大国际问题的看法是一致的。尽管去年秋季帝国主义侵略势力对埃及的军事进攻和对匈牙利的颠复活动使国际局势的和缓过程受到了阻挠，但是由于帝国主义在这两条战线上的侵略活动遭到了失败，一度紧张的国际局势又出现了重新趋向和缓的可能。两国政府声明在总结几年来和平力量和战争势力的反复斗争的过程时指出，“帝国主义的侵略和战争的政策已经越来越不得人心，爱好和平的国家和人民的意志和行动越来越有力地影响着国际局势的发展，世界总的趋势是走向和缓、走向进步的。”这种正确的估计将有力地鼓舞两国人民进一步努力争取国际安全和合作的信心。
    在联合声明中，双方表示坚决反对帝国主义势力复活西德军国主义的活动，并支持德意志民主共和国争取和平统一德国的努力。双方反对帝国主义国家建立的、以扩张和侵略为目的的军事集团以及像所谓“欧洲共同市场”和“欧洲原子能联营组织”那样排他性的组织。虽然联合声明再一次重申为防止德国军国主义势力的扩张和帝国主义侵略而成立的自卫组织华沙条约的继续存在的必要性，但同时指出，华沙条约和北大西洋公约都应当由全欧的集体安全体系所代替。联合声明支持朝鲜人民和越南人民为和平统一祖国而作的努力，同时对正在反对帝国主义威胁的阿拉伯各国和亚非各国人民寄予同情，并愿意在和平共处五项原则的基础上加强同这些国家的友好合作关系。两国政府还全力支持苏联政府最近就欧洲国家的合作、保障中近东各国的和平独立和裁军等问题所提出的重要建议。中捷两国过去已经为争取和平和增进国际合作的事业作了积极的努力，在这次会谈联合声明中所达成的一致见解，无疑地将进一步增强两国今后在国际事务中的携手合作。
    在两国会谈中，社会主义国家之间的关系问题特别受到了重视和强调。两国政府重申坚决支持匈牙利工农革命政府，并将继续帮助匈牙利人民克服他们目前所遇到的困难。马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级国际主义和民族平等的原则，再一次被肯定为社会主义国家关系的基础。两国政府并表示将“继续把维护和加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结作为他们头等重要的国际义务。”必须指出，最近美英首脑在百慕大会谈中，还重申以北大西洋公约“作为两国在西方政策的基石”，对爱好和平的社会主义国家充满了仇视和敌意。这个事实和过去的无数事实都证明了加强社会主义国家之间的团结的重要意义。因此，中捷两国政府联合声明认为，“社会主义国家之间的亲密团结和友好合作是社会主义事业和世界和平的最可靠的保证。”正像最近时期社会主义国家之间举行的许多双边会谈一样，中捷两国政府的会谈和一系列条约、协定和联合声明的签订，也对加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的团结合作和对维护世界和平事业作出了重要的贡献。
    再过几天，捷克斯洛伐克贵宾们就要离开我国了。虽然贵宾们在我们国土上逗留的时间不算长，接触到的方面不算多，但是不远千里而来的捷克斯洛伐克人民的代表们已经在我国广大人民中间留下了极为深刻的印象。西罗基总理热情洋溢、亲切动人的讲话，贵宾们同我国人民的接触和他们对于我国各方面所提供的宝贵意见，都将令人念念难忘。经过这次访问，我们中捷两国人民的心更加交织在一起了，我们团结得更紧密无间了。我们深信，我们两国人民的兄弟友谊将会更加发扬光大，我们的共同事业将取得更大的胜利。
