Changes in "Ganba River" Village
By our reporter Tang Baoshun

I arrived at Ganba River Village in Tonghua County, Jilin Province, just in time for the first anniversary of the founding of the Luming Agricultural Cooperative. At that time, the cadres of the cooperative were busy with the year-end settlement and planning for this year's production, young men and women were happily rehearsing various entertainment programs, and the elderly and children were sitting on the kang, listening to inspiring songs broadcast by the wired broadcasting station. Gu Guangfu, the director of the cooperative, excitedly said to me: "If you are someone who has been away from home for a long time, you will definitely feel like you've taken the wrong road, because the face of Ganba River has completely changed...."

The Changed Land

Ganba River Village has more than 530 hectares of land, and in 1956, it produced more than 1.5 million jin of grain, exceeding the "three fixed" output by 29.4%; exceeding the actual output of the bumper harvest in 1955 by 27%. The cooperative sold 300,000 jin of grain to the state in addition to completing the state's requisition task of more than 500,000 jin of grain. All members of the cooperative increased their income.

The name "Ganba River" itself implies poverty. More than 80% of the village's arable land is hillside and stony land. In the past, because the mountains were high and the slopes were steep, fertilizer could not be applied, and coupled with the lack of water sources, these lands were very barren.

In January last year, all 236 peasant households in the village joined the Luming Agricultural Production Cooperative. The cooperative's management committee first mobilized the members to tap the potential for increased production in every possible way, based on the local characteristics. Everyone believed that to grow more grain, it was necessary to apply more fertilizer, expand the cultivated area, restore abandoned land, build water conservancy projects, and prevent soil erosion. There were many difficulties in applying fertilizer in this area with high mountains and steep slopes. The first problem was that carts could not go up the mountains, and there was not enough labor to carry manure on their backs. At this time, the members studied a method of applying fertilizer in mountainous areas, which was to use tree branches to weave large baskets and use ox-drawn sleds to pull manure up the mountains on the snow. Before the thaw, all the manure was delivered to the fields, so that the fertilizer application area of the entire cooperative reached more than 90%. In order to prevent mountain water from eroding the soil, the cooperative established a nursery and planted protective forests and some fruit trees. Therefore, although there was a lot of rain last year, the hillside land in "Ganba River" Village did not suffer serious damage from rain erosion.

When restoring abandoned land, some members had the idea of "emphasizing large pieces while neglecting small patches." At that time, the agricultural cooperative put forward the slogan of increasing one mu if possible and increasing one fen if possible, without affecting forestry development, and calculated the detailed accounts of accumulating small amounts into large amounts. As a result, the entire cooperative expanded its cultivated land by more than 150 mu, increasing production by nearly 200,000 jin of grain.

What is most surprising is that Ganba River Village planted rice in the first year of collectivization and achieved a bumper harvest. The cooperative cadres spent so much effort to plant rice! The cooperative directors Gu Guangfu, Wu Fenglin, and Wang Yongmao did not know how many large stones they moved to find underground water sources. They finally found a spring at the foot of Nanshan Mountain, and the water was very abundant. The cooperative dug a canal more than two li long along this spring. Unfortunately, this waterway led to newly opened paddy fields, and it had to pass through the "Ganba River" in the middle. The water would sink into the ground when it entered the riverbed. What to do? The members came up with a solution: build a wooden trough canal in the air to let the spring water flow over the river surface. In this way, they planted more than 70 mu of rice, with an average yield of more than 800 jin per mu. Now, the cooperative is planning to build a reservoir to ensure that the paddy fields have sufficient water.

"A Hundred Flowers Blooming" in Mountain Village Production

While increasing grain production, the Luming Agricultural Cooperative also made full use of the favorable conditions for mountain production to develop diversified operations. Before agricultural collectivization, the entire village had only more than 140 cattle and more than 70 sheep. After the establishment of the cooperative this year, the entire cooperative had about 200 cattle and more than 130 sheep; in order to supply piglets, the cooperative also raised more than 20 sows. The cooperative-wide sideline occupations included more than a dozen types such as fruit trees, forestry, medicinal materials, transportation, and weaving, with a total income of more than 20,000 yuan, an average of about 100 yuan per household. Family sideline occupations included no less than 20 types such as raising pigs, chickens, ducks, beekeeping, hunting, and collecting firewood. According to preliminary statistics, the total income from family sideline occupations in the entire cooperative was about 10,000 yuan.

In order to pursue the beautiful prospects for development in mountainous areas, the members have automatically changed the unlucky village name of "Ganba River" Village to "Ganma River" Village. Someone composed a ballad to praise the great changes in this village:

Tall pines grow thick on barren mountains,
Cattle and sheep call in the pastures,
Medicinal herbs, fruit trees, new farm tools,
Rice seedlings grow by the Ganba River.

The Biggest Change is the Change in People

Whenever the farmers in this village talk about the changes in the village, they always like to talk about the changes in people first.

Before liberation, if a girl from another village was to marry into "Ganba River" Village, she would always complain that she should not have been married into this poor mountain valley. Now, no one has heard of anyone despising this mountain valley anymore. On the contrary, urban immigrants and girls from other villages seem particularly happy to hear about settling in this village. In 1955, there were only 184 households in the entire village, but in 1956, it increased to 236 households. Liang Naiyu's eldest nephew, who had left "Ganba River" Village since he was a child, returned to his hometown after the establishment of the cooperative and brought back his wife. He said: "Today's Ganba River is a happy hometown!"

The most prominent change in the people of this village is that women have generally participated in collective labor, and the collectivist ideology of the members has grown. Before the establishment of the agricultural cooperative, only four women in the entire village participated in year-round agricultural production, but now more than 60 women participate in collective labor, earning an average of more than 400 work points per person per year.

The idea of "taking the cooperative as home" is constantly growing in the minds of the members. Here, I will only talk about an ordinary member—the shepherd Li Jinghua. He is a semi-disabled person and has difficulty walking. Last spring, one of the lambs had a problem with its leg, and some members advocated selling it; but Li Jinghua disagreed and proposed to ensure that the lamb would be well-raised. Whenever the lamb could not keep up with the flock, Li Jinghua would hold it, and if it could not grab grass to eat, he would personally feed it. Later, the lamb's leg really recovered. Winter is the lambing season, and Li Jinghua was afraid that the newborn lambs would freeze to death, so he had to go to the sheepfold four or five times every night.

### “干巴河”村的变化

    “干巴河”村的变化
    本报记者  汤宝顺
    我来到吉林省通化县干巴河村，正好是路明农业社诞生的一周年。当时，社里的干部在忙年终决算和筹划今年的生产，青年男女们欢乐地排练着各种娱乐节目，老年人和儿童坐在炕头上，听着有线广播台播送振奋人心的歌曲。社主任顾广福兴冲冲地向我说：“如果您是久别回家的人，一定会感到走错了路，因为干巴河的面貌，已经完全变了样……。”
    改变了的土地
    干巴河全村有五百三十多公顷土地，1956年产粮一百五十多万斤。超过“三定”产量的29.4％；超过丰收的1955年实产量的27％。全社除完成国家五十多万斤粮食的征购任务外，还多卖给国家三十万斤粮食。全社社员都增加了收入。
    “干巴河”这个村名，就包含着贫困的意思。全村可耕土地80％以上是山坡、石头地，过去因为山高坡大，上不了粪，加上缺乏水源，这些土地十分贫瘠。
    去年一月间，全村二百三十六户农民都参加了路明农业生产合作社。社里的管理委员会首先发动社员根据本地特点，千方百计地挖掘增产潜力。大家认为，要多打粮必须多施肥，扩大耕地面积，恢复撩荒地，兴修水利，防止水土流失。这一带山高坡大，施肥的困难是很多的，首先是大车上不了山，用人力背粪，劳力又不足。这时社员们研究出一种山地施肥方法，就是用树条编成大筐，用牛爬犁顶着雪往山上拉粪。在开冻以前粪肥全部送到地里去了，使全社土地施肥面积达到了90％以上。为了防止山水冲刷土壤，社里建立了苗圃，栽上了防护林和一部分果树。因此，去年虽然多雨，“干巴河”村的山坡地却没遭到雨水冲刷的严重灾害。
    在恢复撩荒地的时候，有些社员有“重大片轻小块”的思想，那时候，农业社便提出了在不影响林业发展的情况下，增加一亩是一亩，增加一分是一分的口号，并算了积少成多的细账。结果，全社扩大了一百五十来亩耕地，增产近二十万斤粮食。
    最使人感到惊奇的是，干巴河村在合作化的第一年种上了水稻，并且获得丰产。为了种水稻，社干部花费了多少心血啊！社主任顾广福、吴凤林、王永茂不知搬掉多少大石头寻找地下水源。他们终于在南山地下发现一个泉眼，水很旺，社里顺着这个泉眼挖了一条二里多长的渠道。不巧，这条水道通向新开的稻田，中间要经过“干巴河”，水入河床就要沉入地下，怎么办？社员们想出了办法：空中架起木槽渠道，让泉水腾空流过河面。他们就这样种上了七十多亩水稻，每亩地平均产量达到八百多斤。现在，社里正筹划修建一个贮水池，保证稻田有充分的水。
    山村生产的“百花齐放”
    路明农业社在增产粮食的同时，还充分利用山区生产的有利条件，开展多种经营。在农业合作化以前，全村只有一百四十多头牛、七十多只羊。经过建社这一年，全社有了二百来头牛、一百三十多只羊；为了供应仔猪，社里还养了二十多头母猪。全社性的副业有果树、林业、药材、运输、编织等十几种，全社收入了二万多元，平均每户一百元左右。家庭副业有喂猪、喂鸡、喂鸭、养蜂、打猎、打柴等不下二十种。据初步统计，全社家庭副业收入有一万元左右。
    为了向往山区发展的美丽前途，社员们已经自动把“干巴河”村这个不吉利的村名，改成了“赶马河”村。有人编出了一首歌谣，歌颂这个村子的巨大变化：
    秃山青松粗又高，
    放牧场上牛羊叫，
    药材果树新农具，
    干巴河边长稻苗。
    最大的变化是人的变化
    这个村的农民每当谈起村里的变化的时候，总喜欢先谈人的变化。
    解放以前，外村的姑娘如果要嫁到“干巴河”村，总要埋怨不该将她嫁到这穷山沟里来。现在，再也没有听到轻视这山沟的声音了。相反地，城市移民和外村姑娘听说到这个村落户，还显得格外喜欢。1955年全村只有一百八十四户，到1956年就增加到二百三十六户。社员梁乃玉的大侄从小就离开了“干巴河”村，建社后，他又回到家乡，并且带回了妻子。他说：“今日的干巴河，是幸福的家乡！”
    这个村的人的变化，最突出的是妇女们普遍参加了集体劳动，和社员们的集体主义思想的成长。农业社建立以前，全村只有四名妇女参加全年农业生产，现在却有六十多名妇女参加集体劳动，平均每个人全年挣四百多个工分。
    “以社为家”的思想，在社员心目中不断地成长着。这里，我只谈谈一位普通社员——羊倌李景华。他是一个半残废人，走路很不方便。去年春天，有一只小羊腿出了毛病，有的社员主张卖掉；但李景华不同意，却提出保证把这只小羊放养好。每当这只小羊跟不上羊群的时候，李景华就抱着它，它抢不着草吃，就亲手喂它。后来这只小羊真的养好了腿。冬季是产羔的季节，李景华怕初生小羊羔冻死，每天晚上都要到羊圈去四、五趟。
