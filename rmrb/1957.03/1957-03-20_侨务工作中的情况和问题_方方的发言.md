Situations and Problems in Overseas Chinese Affairs
Fang Fang's Speech

In the past year, under the guidance of the government's correct overseas Chinese affairs policy and with the cooperation of other government agencies in various aspects, overseas Chinese affairs work has achieved certain successes.

Achievements of Overseas Chinese Affairs Work in the Past Year

The policy of "One Family of Patriots" and "Patriotism Regardless of When It Began" has greatly promoted overseas Chinese work.

The Chinese government's call for "One Family of Patriots" and "Patriotism Regardless of When It Began" has greatly promoted overseas Chinese work abroad. Many old Kuomintang members, many heads of overseas Chinese organizations and veteran overseas Chinese leaders who had been deceived by the Chiang Kai-shek clique were deeply moved. They held forums and gatherings, issued circular telegrams and statements, and expressed their support for the motherland. This policy also provided profound education for the vast number of patriotic overseas Chinese, who took the initiative to win over figures who did not yet understand the motherland, to be considerate of the situation of overseas Chinese who still had difficulties and were inconvenient to openly express their patriotic stance, and to extend a long-term and patient hand of unity to them. As a result, many overseas Chinese who previously did not understand the motherland well or had doubts about it have gained a new and deeper understanding of the motherland. The number of people returning to the country for sightseeing has exceeded the total of the past five years. Premier Zhou and other state delegations received an unprecedentedly warm and moving welcome from overseas Chinese during their visits abroad, fully demonstrating the further surge in overseas Chinese patriotism. The scope of unity has been greatly expanded, and the vast majority of overseas Chinese have united under the banner of patriotism.

The friendship between overseas Chinese and local people has also greatly developed. With the enhancement of friendly relations between many host countries and China, the patriotic unity of overseas Chinese has further expanded. When local people encounter difficulties, overseas Chinese can also carry out mutual assistance and mutual relief with them. Through the close and friendly relationship between overseas Chinese and local people, the cultural and economic exchanges between the motherland and the overseas Chinese communities have also been further developed. Many overseas Chinese have voluntarily chosen the local nationality because they are willing to live with the local people for a long time. This freedom and right to voluntarily choose nationality is in line with the wishes of the overseas Chinese and the interests of enhancing the friendly relations between China and the many Asian and African countries where overseas Chinese reside. This is also the spirit of the dual nationality treaty signed between the Chinese government and the Indonesian government, as well as the spirit of Premier Zhou's speech at the overseas Chinese welcome meeting in Burma on December 18 last year. Premier Zhou further called on overseas Chinese to engage in industrial construction that is beneficial to the local area, pointing out a clear economic path for overseas Chinese and further promoting the friendly relations between overseas Chinese and local people.

These correct policies will further promote the great unity of patriotic overseas Chinese and promote long-term friendship between overseas Chinese and the people of their countries of residence.

Overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese actively participate in socialist construction and socialist transformation.

Domestically, in the past year, domestic overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese, along with the people of the whole country, have actively participated in socialist construction and socialist transformation. In the agricultural cooperation movement, the remaining problems after the land reform have been largely resolved. Guangdong and Fujian provinces have changed the class status of more than 38,000 overseas Chinese households who were landowners and rich peasants, accounting for more than 95% of those classified as overseas Chinese landowners and rich peasants during the land reform. In the agricultural cooperation movement, 90% of overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese (including overseas Chinese landowners and rich peasants whose class status has been changed) have joined agricultural production cooperatives. Overseas Chinese relatives who have difficulties in life and cannot participate in labor receive certain land remuneration. Widows, widowers, orphans, and the childless among overseas Chinese households are gradually receiving "five guarantees" care. Production in overseas Chinese areas has developed, and the income of many overseas Chinese households that have joined cooperatives has increased. For example, in the Xingfu Cooperative in Chao'an County, Guangdong, 131 out of 154 overseas Chinese relatives households increased their income, accounting for 85% of the total number of overseas Chinese households. In the Hongxing and other five advanced cooperatives in Jinjiang County, Fujian, 89.8% of overseas Chinese households also increased their income. In the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and handicrafts, the assets of overseas Chinese industrialists and merchants have been reasonably valued, and their positions have been properly arranged. The dividends of enterprises established by overseas Chinese investment after liberation have also slightly increased after joint operation. Many overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese handicraftsmen have joined handicraft production cooperatives, and their production, supply, and marketing have been incorporated into the plan, reducing work stoppages during the off-season. As a result, the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese investment in participating in socialist construction has also increased in the past year. For example, taking the amount of overseas Chinese investment in 1951 as 100, the amount in 1955 was 717 and the amount in 1956 was 1144. Overseas Chinese investment in the construction of welfare undertakings in their hometowns has also increased. Last year, overseas Chinese in Guangdong and Fujian provinces established a total of 14 middle schools in their hometowns. Fujian built and expanded more than 20 overseas Chinese primary schools. Overseas Chinese donations in the Jinjiang Special Zone for establishing schools, hospitals, farmland water conservancy, and other public welfare undertakings reached more than 4 million yuan. Last year, overseas remittances increased in all regions except for a slight decrease in the Guangzhou area. From a national perspective, overseas remittances are basically stable. The supply of materials in overseas Chinese areas, especially in terms of grain, is not only stable compared to the previous year, but also receives special care. For example, in the second quarter of last year, Fujian increased the allocation of 12.3 million catties of rice, and Guangdong increased the allocation of 10 million catties of rice as special grain for overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese. Pork, edible oil, and other non-staple foods were also allocated during the Spring Festival this year. Although the problem of building materials was resolved a bit late in the first half of last year, it has gradually been resolved since the second half of the year. In addition, the relevant departments of the central government and local party and government agencies have also assisted overseas Chinese affairs departments in many tasks related to the reception and resettlement of returned overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese students.

However, there are still many prominent problems that need to be solved in the current overseas Chinese affairs work, such as how to universally increase the income of overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese in agricultural cooperation; how to facilitate overseas remittances, improve the supply of materials to overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese, so that overseas Chinese relatives can settle down in their hometowns; how to make them feel the warmth of the motherland and give play to their enthusiasm for work and study in the resettlement of returned overseas Chinese and the schooling of overseas Chinese students and children of overseas Chinese relatives; how to solve the housing problem in the remaining issues of land reform in a planned and step-by-step manner, etc.

Several problems in the current overseas Chinese affairs work

Promote advanced experience so that overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese can universally increase their income

1.  In order to enable overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese to universally increase their income after joining advanced agricultural cooperatives, we should promote the experience of the Wang Hanguo Cooperative in Jieyang, the Liming Cooperative in Haicheng, the Li Qiubo Cooperative in Taishan, and the Xingfu Cooperative in Chao'an, and adapt to local conditions according to the consistent production characteristics of overseas Chinese areas; increase the production of staple food, and arrange diversified operations and sideline occupations, so that members with strong labor power in the entire cooperative can give play to their labor power, and overseas Chinese relatives with weak labor power can also have work arrangements and give play to their expertise, so that 80%-90% of overseas Chinese household members can increase their income like farmer members. On the basis of striving for a bumper harvest of staple food this year, arrange diversified operations, arrange sideline occupations, and arrange labor, so that people can make the most of their talents and materials; we should also reasonably adjust the cooperative funds of overseas Chinese relatives and adjust the orchards and fish ponds into the cooperative in the local rectification, so that they can be reasonably managed and reasonably distributed; it must be allowed that overseas Chinese who have no labor force and have difficulties in life, or who have overseas remittances to help them but still have people abroad preparing to return to participate in the cooperative, can retain a certain amount of dividends from the land. We will assist the party and government departments at all levels in the overseas Chinese areas to solve these problems under their leadership.

Improve the supply of materials to overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese, so that overseas Chinese relatives can settle down in their hometowns

2.  Improve the supply of materials in overseas Chinese areas and guide overseas Chinese investment work. It is recommended that the state planning department slightly increase the supply of materials to overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese on the basis of last year's indicators. Appropriately increase the supply indicators (grain, oil, sugar, cloth, non-staple food, building materials) required by overseas Chinese areas with a large number of overseas remittances, and incorporate them into the national plan; strive to improve the allocation of materials, so that materials in areas that are not in urgent need are not stockpiled, and areas in need can sell them (such as sugar, floral cloth, and other high-end products). We have submitted the preferential measures (draft) for overseas Chinese investment in state-run overseas Chinese investment companies to the State Council for review, and recommended the establishment of a general investment company to strengthen the leadership of overseas Chinese investment in various parts of the country and give play to the patriotic and hometown-loving enthusiasm of overseas Chinese; encourage and assist overseas Chinese in reclaiming barren mountains and wastelands, and guide them to engage more in tropical and subtropical crops, contribute their expertise to meet the needs of socialist construction.

Do a good job in receiving, resettling, and educating returned overseas Chinese

3.  In order to make returned overseas Chinese work at ease and overseas Chinese children studying in China study at ease, we must do a good job in receiving and resettling them; at the same time, we must educate returned overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese students to not only understand the great achievements of the country in construction, but also understand the difficulties of the country in its advancement, give play to the spirit of being masters of their own affairs, and work and study hard with the people of the whole country to overcome difficulties, and should not make excessive demands. In short, we must make them feel like they have entered a warm big family as soon as they arrive in the motherland, and work and study diligently with the people of the motherland to build the country, share weal and woe, and work and study together.

It is estimated that a considerable number of children of overseas Chinese relatives in various places will not be able to enter junior high school, senior high school, and university this year. We should actively conduct labor production education for the children of overseas Chinese relatives, so that they can settle down and participate in production and construction, which is the main thing. At the same time, it is also recommended that the relevant departments study in the overseas Chinese areas to consolidate and expand the schools run by overseas Chinese, and the overseas Chinese middle schools should open two-part classes as much as possible, and set up more remedial classes in Chinese, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and technology to appropriately accommodate the children of overseas Chinese relatives who fail to enter schools.

Gradually resolve the remaining problems after the land reform

4.  We must also continue to properly handle some of the remaining problems from the past.

The problem of changing the class status of overseas Chinese landowners and rich peasants has been basically resolved in Guangdong and Fujian provinces in the past two years, and other places are also dealing with it one after another. The question now is how to eliminate past estrangement, strengthen the unity of overseas Chinese farmers, help each other, and settle down to production.

During the land reform, the houses of overseas Chinese households that should not have been confiscated or requisitioned but were confiscated or requisitioned have been returned to overseas Chinese in part in the past few years. However, the housing problem is a complex problem. On the one hand, we should take active measures to gradually solve it in a planned and step-by-step manner. On the other hand, we cannot adopt rigid methods. If handled improperly, it will cause dissatisfaction among farmers and affect the unity of overseas Chinese farmers. We should carefully study and properly resolve it in a step-by-step and planned manner in the spirit of internal unity of the people. Overseas Chinese houses that should not have been confiscated or requisitioned according to the Land Law but were confiscated or requisitioned, and have not been distributed to farmers for living (including overseas Chinese houses used by organs, groups, troops, enterprises, and schools), should be cleared and returned to the original owners. If the unit using the house has difficulty in returning it for a while, it should consult with the owner, draw up a lease contract, agree on the rent, specify the lease term, guarantee the payment of rent, and return it as agreed when the term expires. If the owner is unwilling to rent it, the unit using the house should find a way to solve the difficulty in using the house and return it regularly or in installments. All rented houses must be cherished, and those who are damaged should be compensated according to the price. As for the houses that have been distributed to farmers for living, we should proceed from reality, distinguish the situation, and gradually solve them in the spirit of mutual consideration, mutual assistance, and mutual concession: (1) Reasonable adjustment: fully utilize the mobile houses (vacant houses that can be repaired, undistributed houses of landlords and rich peasants confiscated and requisitioned during the land reform used by organs and enterprises, etc.), distribute them to farmers for living, and withdraw from overseas Chinese houses; (2) In the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual concession, adopt a consultation method to return the necessary and main houses to overseas Chinese, or assist farmers in solving difficulties and moving back to their original houses; (3) Take the township, village (or production cooperative) as a unit, combine the planning of building townships and cooperatives, and the situation that there are more and more returned overseas Chinese in overseas Chinese areas, the rural population is increasing, and there are not enough houses to live in, give full play to the enthusiasm of farmers and overseas Chinese in loving and building their hometowns. Those who have money contribute money, those who have strength contribute strength, build new houses in stages and batches, and gradually solve the difficulties of returned overseas Chinese and farmers in living.

In the past few years, returned overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese relatives, together with the people of the whole country, have participated in the social reform movement and socialist transformation. In the future, they will certainly be able to complete the great cause of socialist construction together with the people of the whole country. The state takes care of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese relatives according to their characteristics, and returned overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese relatives will certainly be able to respond to the various calls of the state in the spirit of overcoming difficulties and the glorious tradition of building a family diligently and thriftily, and strive for future prosperity and happiness.

    侨务工作中的情况和问题
    方方的发言
    过去一年，在政府正确侨务政策指导下，在政府其他机构各方面工作配合下，侨务工作取得了一定的成绩。一年来侨务工作的成就
    “爱国一家”“爱国不分先后”的政策，对国外华侨工作起了巨大的推动作用
    我国政府提出“爱国一家”“爱国不分先后”的号召，对国外华侨工作起了巨大的推动。许多老国民党员，许多受蒋介石集团欺骗的华侨团体负责人和老侨领，深受感动，都纷纷举行座谈、集会、发表通电声明，拥护祖国。这一政策，也给广大爱国侨胞以深刻的教育，主动去争取对祖国尚未理解的人物，体谅对尚有困难、不便公开表明他们爱国立场的侨胞的处境，向他们伸出长期而耐心的团结之手。因此，许多过去对祖国不够了解有疑虑的华侨，对祖国有了进一步新的认识，回国观光的人数，超过了过去五年的总和，总理和国家其他代表团出国访问，获得了华侨空前热烈动人的欢迎，充分表露了华侨爱国情绪更加高涨，团结面有了很大的扩展，绝大部分华侨已经团结在爱国的旗帜下。
    华侨与当地人民的友谊也大大地发展了。在许多所在国和我国的友好关系的增进之下，华侨的爱国团结更益扩大了。在当地人民遇到困难的时候，华侨也能与当地人民开展互助互济。通过华侨与当地人民的亲密友好相处，祖国的文化、经济和侨居地的文化经济交流，也得到进一步的发展。不少华侨由于愿意和当地人民长期共处而自愿地选择了当地的国籍，这自愿选择国籍的自由和权利，是符合华侨的愿望，和增进我国和华侨众多的亚非各国的友好关系的利益的，这也就是我国政府与印度尼西亚政府之间签订的双重国籍条约的精神，以及周总理去年12月18日在缅甸华侨欢迎会上的讲话的精神。周总理更号召华侨从事对当地有利的工业建设，给华侨指出了明确的经济出路，更进一步促进了华侨与当地人民的友好关系。
    这些正确的政策，都将更加促进华侨的爱国大团结，促进华侨和侨居国人民的长期友好。
    侨眷和归侨积极地参加社会主义建设和社会主义改造
    在国内方面，一年来，国内侨眷、归侨也和全国人民一道，积极地参加社会主义建设与社会主义改造。在农业合作化中，土改后的遗留问题，已大部分获得解决，广东、福建二省改变华侨地主、富农成份的侨户有三万八千多户，占土改时划为华侨地主、富农的95％以上。农业合作化运动中，侨眷、归侨（包括改变了成份的华侨地主和富农）已有90％参加了农业生产合作社，生活困难不能参加劳动的侨眷，获得一定的土地报酬，侨户中的鳏寡孤独逐步地得到“五保”照顾。侨区生产有了发展，许多入社的侨户收入有了增加。如广东潮安县的幸福社，在一百五十四户侨眷中，有一百三十一户增加了收入，占侨户总数的85％。福建晋江县红星等五个高级社的侨户，也有89.8％增加收入。在资本主义工商业和手工业的社会主义改造中，华侨工商业者的资产得到合理的估价，职位得到适当的安排，解放后华侨投资兴办的企业，合营后股息比合营前也略有提高。许多侨眷、归侨手工业者参加了手工业生产合作社，在产、供、销方面纳入了计划，减少淡季停工。因而，一年来华侨投资参加社会主义建设的积极性也更加提高，如以1951年华侨投资额为一百计算，则1955年为七百一十七，1956年为一千一百四十四。华侨对家乡福利事业的兴建也有增长，去年广东、福建两省华侨在家乡兴办中学共十四所，福建兴建扩建的华侨小学二十多所，晋江专区华侨捐款兴办学校、医院、农田水利和其他公益事业达四百多万元。去年侨汇收入除广州区略有减少外，其他地区都有上升，从全国来说，侨汇基本上是稳定的。侨区的物资供应，首先是粮食方面，比之前年不仅稳定，而且还得到特别照顾，如去年第二季度福建就增拨一千二百三十万斤大米，广东就增拨一千万斤大米作为侨眷、归侨的特殊用粮，今年春节猪肉、食油及其它副食品，也给予调拨照顾。建筑器材，虽然去年上半年解决得迟了一点，但下半年以后也逐步得到了解决。此外对归国华侨和华侨学生的接待与安置，中央各有关部门和各地党政机关，也协助侨务部门做了许多工作。
    但是，目前侨务工作，比较突出应解决的问题也还不少，如在农业合作化中对侨眷、归侨如何能普遍增加收入；如何便利侨汇，改进对侨眷、归侨的物资供应，使侨眷安于乡居；对归国华侨的安置和归国华侨学生与侨眷子女的就学问题，如何使他们感到祖国的温暖，发挥他们工作和学习的积极性；如何有计划有步骤解决土改遗留问题中的房屋问题等等。目前侨务工作中的几个问题
    推广先进经验，使侨眷和归侨能普遍增加收入
    一、为着使侨眷、归侨在参加农业高级合作社以后，更能普遍地增加收入，应当推广揭阳汪汉国社、海澄黎明社、台山李球伯社、潮安幸福社的经验，根据侨乡一贯的生产特点，因地制宜；既增产主粮，又安排多种经营，安排副业，既使全社劳动力强的社员得以发挥劳力，又使劳动力弱的侨眷也有工作安排，发挥其特长，使80％—90％的侨户社员，和农民社员一样增加收入。在争取今年主粮大丰收的基础上，安排多种经营，安排副业，安排劳动，使人尽其能，材尽其用；还应当在各地整社中，合理调整侨眷入社基金，调整果树、鱼塘入社，使能合理经营、合理分益；必须允许没有劳动力而生活有困难、或生活虽有侨汇帮助而国外仍有人准备回来参加合作社的华侨的土地，能保留一定的分红。我们将协助侨乡的各级党政部门，在他们领导下解决这些问题。
    改进对侨眷、归侨的物资供应，使侨眷安于乡居
    二、改进侨乡的物资供应和辅导华侨投资工作。建议国家计划部门对侨眷、归侨的物资供应，在去年的指标的基础上略为增加。将侨汇很多的侨区，所必需供应的物资指标适当增加（粮、油、糖、布、副食品、建筑材料），并纳入国家的计划之内；努力改进物资的调拨工作，使不急需的地区的物资不积压，需要的地区有得销（如糖、花布、及其他高档品）。我们已将华侨投资于国家经营的华侨投资公司的优待办法（草案）呈上国务院审核，并建议成立投资总公司，加强对全国各地华侨投资的领导，发挥华侨爱国爱乡的热情；鼓励和协助华侨开垦荒山荒地，引导他们更多地经营热带及亚热带作物，贡献他们的特长以配合社会主义建设的需要。
    做好接待、安置和教育归侨的工作
    三、为着使归侨安心工作及回国就学的华侨子弟安心学习，必须做好接待和安置的工作；同时又必须教育归侨及华侨学生，不仅要了解国家在建设中的伟大成就，还要了解国家在前进中的困难，发挥主人翁的精神，和全国人民共同刻苦地为克服困难而工作、学习，不应该要求过高。总之，要做到使他们一到祖国，就像是进入温暖的大家庭，和祖国人民一道地勤俭建国，休戚与共，共同工作和学习。
    估计今年各地考不进初、高中学和大学的侨眷子弟为数不少。应当对侨眷子女积极进行劳动生产的教育，使他们安心参加生产建设，这是主要的。同时也建议有关部门研究在侨区中，将侨办学校巩固扩大，侨区中学尽可能开办二部制的班级，并多设语文、数、理、化以及技术等补习班，适当收容考不上学校的侨眷子弟。
    逐步解决土地改革后的遗留问题
    四、还要继续处理好过去的一些遗留问题。
    提早改变华侨地主、富农成分问题，两年来广东、福建两省已经基本上解决，其他各地也在陆续处理中。现在问题是应如何消除过去隔阂，加强侨农的团结，互相帮助，安居生产。
    土改时，华侨户不应没收、征收而被没收、征收的房屋，几年来一部分已退还华侨。但房屋问题是一个复杂的问题，一方面，应当采取积极办法，有计划有步骤地逐步解决。另一方面，也不能采用生硬的办法。如果处理不当，将会使农民不满，影响侨农团结。应当本着人民内部团结的精神，慎重研究，有步骤有计划地妥善解决。土改时依土地法不应没收、征收而已没收、征收的华侨房屋，未分配给农民居住的（包括机关、团体、部队、企业、学校使用的华侨房屋），应清理退还原业主。若用房单位，一时退还有困难，应商得业主的同意，立成租约，议定租金，写明租期，保证交租，期满如约归还。如业主不愿出租，用房单位应设法解决用房困难，定期退还或分期归还。凡租用房屋，均须爱护，有损坏者应依价赔偿。至已分配给农民居住的房屋，应本着双方兼顾、互助互让精神，从实际出发，分别情况，逐步解决：（1）合理调整：充分利用机动房屋（可以修补的空屋，机关、企业使用的土改时没收、征收的地主富农的未分房屋等），分给农民居住，退出华侨房屋；（2）本着互助互让的精神，采取协商办法，退还华侨所必需的，和主要的房屋，或者协助农民解决困难搬回原屋；（3）以乡、村（或生产社）为单位结合建乡建社的规划，和侨乡归侨日多，农村人口增加房屋不够居住的情况，充分发挥农民和华侨爱乡建乡的积极性。有钱出钱，有力出力，分期分批建筑新房，逐步解决归侨和农民居住的困难。
    归侨、侨眷在过去几年中，和全国人民一道参加了社会改革运动以及社会主义改造，今后也一定能和全国人民一道完成社会主义建设的伟大事业。国家对于华侨和归侨、侨眷，既根据他们的特点予以照顾，归侨、侨眷也一定能本着自己的克服困难、勤俭兴家的光荣传统，响应国家的各种号召，为未来的繁荣幸福而努力。
