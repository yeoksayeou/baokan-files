Xinhua News Agency, March 8th: According to TASS reports: The First All-Union Congress of Soviet Artists concluded on March 7th in the Moscow Kremlin.

The congress opened on February 28th. During the eight days of meetings, in addition to hearing and discussing the report on the situation and tasks of Soviet visual arts made by Soviet People's Artist Ioganson, vice-reports on issues such as oil painting, ink painting, sculpture, art research, and criticism were heard and discussed; the charter of the Soviet Artists Association was adopted. The congress also elected a board of directors of the Artists Association composed of ninety-nine people and a central review committee composed of twenty-five people.

The delegates who participated in this congress spoke enthusiastically at the meeting. In their speeches, they affirmed the path of socialist realism in creation. They pointed out that the path of socialist realism is not a path to narrow the creative field of artists, but to infinitely expand the creative field for the benefit and happiness of the people. The achievements of Soviet artists are the result of creatively mastering the method of socialist realism and conducting an irreconcilable struggle against formalism, naturalism, and the influence of bourgeois ideology. They also talked about the current shortcomings in the Soviet art world, such as the tendency of photographicism and naturalism, and the sectarian tendencies of some artists. They also put forward methods to ensure the further improvement of Soviet visual arts.

At the closing meeting, a letter from the Congress to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was unanimously adopted. The letter stated: The method of socialist realism guides artists to pay attention to the profound development process of life, and provides artists with unlimited possibilities to boldly express creativity and fully develop individual style.

    全苏第一届美术家代表大会闭幕
    肯定了社会主义现实主义的创作道路
    据新华社8日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联第一届全国美术家代表大会7日在莫斯科克里姆林宫闭幕。
    代表大会是2月28日开幕的。在历时八天的会议中，除了听取和讨论了苏联人民艺术家约甘桑所作关于苏联造型艺术的情况和任务的报告外；还听取和讨论了有关油画、水墨画、雕刻、美术研究和批评等问题的副报告；通过了苏联美术家协会章程。大会还选举了由九十九人组成的美术家协会理事会和二十五人组成的中央审查委员会。
    参加这次代表大会的代表在大会上踊跃发言。他们在发言中肯定社会主义现实主义的创作道路，他们指出，社会主义现实主义的道路，不是缩小美术家创作领域的道路，而是为了人民利益和幸福无限制地扩大创作领域的道路。苏联美术家取得的成就是由于创造性地掌握了社会主义现实主义的方法，同形式主义、自然主义和资产阶级思想意识的影响进行不调和的斗争的结果。他们还谈到了苏联美术界目前存在的缺点，如摄影主义和自然主义的倾向，一些美术家的宗派主义倾向等。他们还提出了保证苏联造型艺术进一步提高的方法。
    在闭幕会议上，一致通过了大会致苏联共产党中央委员会的一封信。信中说：社会主义现实主义方法引导美术家去注意生活的深刻发展过程，给美术家提供大胆地表现创造性和全面地发挥个人风格的无限可能性。
