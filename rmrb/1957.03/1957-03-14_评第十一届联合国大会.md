Commentary on the Eleventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly
Tan Wenrui

The Eleventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, which opened on November 12th of last year, has temporarily concluded on March 8th after repeatedly extending its session. If this session of the United Nations General Assembly, which lasted for almost four months, is measured against the ardent expectations of the people of all countries, the harvest is unsatisfactory. The Western bloc, headed by the United States, should be held responsible for the failure of this session to make due contributions to consolidating peace and easing international tensions.

This session of the General Assembly began its agenda under very complex international circumstances. Although the international reactionary forces suffered defeats in their adventurous undertakings on the Egyptian and Hungarian fronts, they were still unwilling to abandon their policy of inciting the "Cold War." On the one hand, they intensified their efforts to create new conspiracies to suppress the national independence movements of various countries in the Middle East region; on the other hand, they tried their best to stir up a worldwide anti-Soviet and anti-communist frenzy in order to provide cover for their aggressive conspiratorial activities. In order to safeguard peace and the independence and sovereignty of the people of all countries, the peace-loving people of all countries launched another round of fierce struggle against the imperialist aggressive forces. This fierce struggle naturally could not but be reflected in the United Nations General Assembly. Therefore, two completely different lines were manifested at the General Assembly: the majority of peace-loving countries tried to make the General Assembly play its role in maintaining world peace and security, and to make some achievements in easing international tensions; while the Western aggressive bloc headed by the United States tried its best to tie the hands and feet of the United Nations, so that this organization could continue to be their tool for the "Cold War."

New Blood Brings New Atmosphere

The expansion of the United Nations membership, to a certain extent, reflects the strengthening of peace forces and anti-colonialist forces within the United Nations. The previous session of the General Assembly, overcoming the obstruction of the United States and other Western countries, admitted sixteen new member states. This session of the General Assembly opened the door for countries such as Sudan, Morocco, Tunisia, and Japan (due to the United States' stubborn adherence to its discriminatory policy, the Mongolian People's Republic is still unreasonably excluded from the United Nations). Thus, this session of the General Assembly had representatives from eighty countries participating (on the eve of the adjournment of the General Assembly, it also admitted the newly born Ghana as a member state). Ten socialist countries and twenty-five Asian and African countries that had participated in the Bandung Conference together account for nearly half of the total number of United Nations member states. This situation is certainly not to the liking of the US ruling clique. The US "Christian Science Monitor" pointed out that the policy adopted by the United States at this session of the General Assembly was to try to reorganize its voting machine and restore the US "lost power and leadership."

In this session of the General Assembly, at least two things show how the US ruling clique spared no effort to continue to control the international organization of the United Nations. The United States used its voting machine to veto the proposal put forward by India and supported by many other countries, preventing the issue of restoring our country's representation from being included on the agenda of the General Assembly. Nevertheless, in reality, the General Assembly still held a fierce debate on this issue, and representatives of many countries condemned the practice of the United States and its followers in opposing the normalization of international relations in their speeches. The US position encountered much wider opposition than in the previous session of the General Assembly, where twelve countries supported the discussion of this issue, while this time, twenty-five countries supported the Indian proposal. And as an editorial in the "Washington Post" commented on this vote, "The abstentions of some countries in the vote are a clear indication of their growing disagreement with the US attitude, and if you ask other representatives what they really think, this disagreement would be even more widespread." No wonder United Press reporter Tittersos lamented: "This may be the last year that the United States can get enough support from the General Assembly to prevent the admission of Communist China." Secondly, the United States' insistence on electing the Philippines to the Security Council, thereby forcibly seizing the seat of Eastern European countries, regardless of the provisions of the United Nations Charter and the London Gentlemen's Agreement, was also extremely unpopular, and it was also severely condemned morally.

The United States and the Aggressors Sing the Same Tune

The United Nations played a positive role in stopping the armed aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel. Before the opening of the 11th General Assembly, the emergency meeting convened by the United Nations in early November of last year adopted a resolution requesting a ceasefire in Egypt and instructing the invading forces of Britain, France, and Israel to immediately withdraw from Egypt. At that time, under the strong pressure of world opinion, the British, French, and Israeli aggressors had to stop their armed actions, but the troops of the three aggressor countries still occupied Egyptian territory and refused to withdraw, making the Middle East region continue to be in danger of war breaking out again at any time. Therefore, taking effective measures to urge the troops of Britain, France, and Israel to completely withdraw from Egypt became the most urgent task of the Eleventh General Assembly.

In the discussion of the Egyptian issue, representatives of the vast majority of countries unanimously condemned the aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel, and demanded that they immediately withdraw their troops from Egypt. The three aggressor countries put forward various unreasonable preconditions in an attempt to evade the implementation of the United Nations decision. Britain and France desperately distorted the functions of the United Nations Emergency Force, trying to use the United Nations Emergency Force to achieve their long-term occupation of Egypt; Israel even brazenly refused to return the Gaza Strip and the islands of Tiran and Sanafir in the Gulf of Aqaba to Egypt. The United States, which had always pretended to disagree with the armed aggression by Britain, France, and Israel, came out to play the role of helping the aggressors delay the withdrawal of troops, insisting that the United Nations should first deal with technical issues such as clearing the Suez Canal. However, under the unanimous insistence of the majority of countries, the General Assembly passed the proposal of the twenty Asian and African countries on November 24 last year, once again requesting Britain, France, and Israel to abide by the United Nations resolutions and immediately withdraw their aggressive troops. Britain and France saw that the situation was not good, and only withdrew their aggressive troops from Egyptian territory on December 22 last year. However, another aggressor, Israel, still refused to withdraw its troops. Even after the General Assembly passed the resolution for the sixth time ordering Israel to withdraw its aggressive troops, Israel stubbornly insisted that it was "fully entitled" not to allow the situation to return to the state before it launched aggression against Egypt. And the developments in the later period of the General Assembly clearly showed that Israel was so bold and reckless because the United States was behind the scenes protecting this aggressor. On the one hand, the United States prevented the United Nations from imposing sanctions on Israel; on the other hand, it used secret "guarantees" to meet Israel's unreasonable demands, in fact, it wanted to use the United Nations Emergency Force to implement a plan for long-term occupation of the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba area. It was precisely because of the troublemaking and obstruction of Israel and its American protector that the United Nations showed considerable weakness in stopping aggression in the Middle East, and now there is still a tail left in the Middle East issue. This cannot but damage the prestige of the United Nations to a certain extent.

Unprecedented Disruptive Behavior

It should be pointed out that the Western countries, headed by the United States, deliberately intended to divert the attention of the General Assembly from urgent issues such as stopping aggressive actions in the Middle East from the very beginning. They brought out the so-called "Hungarian issue" to disrupt the agenda of the General Assembly, attempting to force the General Assembly to get entangled in this meaningless debate, and not be able to seriously carry out its normal work.

Whenever the General Assembly was about to start doing some serious things, the United States and its followers forced the General Assembly to discuss the so-called "Hungarian issue," while putting aside some important international issues. They proposed and manipulated the General Assembly to illegally pass about half a dozen motions that slandered the Soviet Union and interfered in Hungary's internal affairs. This is simply a great insult to the authority of the United Nations.

The actions of the Western countries to force the so-called "Hungarian issue" onto the agenda of the General Assembly violated the United Nations Charter. The Charter stipulates that the United Nations has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of a country. The statement issued by the Hungarian Foreign Minister on December 11 last year protesting the General Assembly's interference in Hungary's internal affairs and announcing that he would not participate in the discussion of the so-called "Hungarian issue" was completely justified and necessary.

However, even in the process of discussing the so-called "Hungarian issue," the situation was not so favorable for those who attempted to stir up anti-Soviet and anti-communist hysteria. Representatives of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries righteously exposed and condemned the conspiratorial aims of the Western group; and cited a large number of irrefutable facts to prove that those who hypocritically pretended to sympathize with the Hungarian people were the ones who instigated the counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary. Representatives of these countries also convincingly pointed out that the scope of subversion activities carried out by the United States far exceeded just Hungary alone. The Soviet Union also proposed a motion on December 12 last year requesting the General Assembly to discuss the issue of "US interference in the internal affairs of people's democratic countries and its sabotage activities against these countries." Although this item was included on the agenda, and the discussion of this issue also proved that the US government had indeed and continued to carry out subversive activities against many countries, and regarded this activity as an integral part of US foreign policy, the motion proposed by the Soviet Union requesting the United Nations to condemn and stop this activity of the United States was rejected by the Special Political Committee under the manipulation of the United States. In this way, the United Nations was once again prevented from fulfilling its sacred duty to safeguard national sovereignty.

Anti-Colonialism Wave is Irresistible

1956 was a year of unprecedented upsurge in the anti-colonialist movement, so the issue of colonialism was a major item on the agenda of the Eleventh General Assembly. The deteriorating situation in Algeria attracted the most attention, and the General Assembly spent a long time discussing this issue. France's practice of not seeking a peaceful resolution to this issue in the past year in accordance with the expectations of the United Nations, but instead intensifying its military suppression, was strongly criticized by many countries. Although the proposal of the eighteen Asian and African countries to grant the Algerians the right to self-determination was strangled in the Political Committee by the forces gathered by the colonial countries, the part of this proposal that advocated recognizing the Algerian people's right to self-determination in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter was passed by a majority. This shows that most countries recognize the Algerian people's right to self-determination. At the same time, the compromise proposal finally passed by the General Assembly in fact also confirmed that the United Nations is fully entitled to take action on the Algerian issue. This is by no means something that France can cover up with the kind of nonsense it spread after the meeting, such as the United Nations General Assembly having agreed to "stop interfering in Algeria."

The first discussion of the Cyprus issue in the United Nations General Assembly was also a victory for the anti-colonialist forces in the United Nations. Representatives of many countries condemned Britain's colonial policy in the discussion and supported the Cypriot people's demand for self-determination. The resolution passed by the General Assembly on this issue did not explicitly instruct Britain to satisfy the Cypriot people's desire for self-determination, but it pointed out that the Cyprus issue must be resolved peacefully, democratically, and justly in accordance with the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter, which in fact negated Britain's policy of replacing negotiations with violence.

As for the West Irian issue, although the thirteen-nation proposal to establish a three-person mediation committee to assist the Netherlands and Indonesia in resuming negotiations and resolving the West Irian issue in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter was unreasonably rejected, it can be seen from the discussion process and the results of the vote that most countries support Indonesia's position of recovering West Irian.

In addition, the decision of this session of the General Assembly to end the trusteeship status of Togoland, which was originally ruled by Britain, and the adoption of the Soviet proposal to grant other five trust territories independence or autonomy as soon as possible, all reflect how irresistible the current anti-colonialist trend is.

It is worth noting the attitude of the United States, which has always pretended to oppose colonialism, in discussing these colonial issues. US representatives openly came out to defend the colonialist positions of countries such as Britain and France, and opposed the United Nations intervening in these issues. In this way, this session of the General Assembly actually played the role of a "demon-revealing mirror," and it once again exposed the true face of American colonialists, making it increasingly difficult for the United States' flowery words against colonialism to deceive people.

Disarmament Issue Only Played a Passing Scene

The disarmament issue is one of the important issues that this session of the General Assembly should address. The Soviet Union had already put forward a comprehensive disarmament proposal on November 17 last year; at this session of the General Assembly, the Soviet Union also put forward two proposals advocating the convening of a special session of the General Assembly to discuss the disarmament issue and demanding that all countries immediately stop testing nuclear weapons. This shows the Soviet Union's sincere desire to seek a solution to the disarmament issue.

Before the opening of the General Assembly, the United States had vigorously spread the air that it would put forward a new disarmament plan at the General Assembly to promote the resolution of the disarmament issue, but the result was only a vague and general suggestion. This suggestion even put forward unreasonable preconditions for banning nuclear weapons testing, its purpose was clearly to make the disarmament work regress to the kind of aimless debate at the beginning. Due to the obstruction of the United States and other Western countries, the General Assembly did not conduct any actual discussion on the disarmament issue, but only handed over all the relevant proposals to the subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Committee for handling. This cannot but be regarded as a major defect of this session of the General Assembly.

The characteristic of this session of the United Nations General Assembly is that repeated and fierce struggles have been waged on every important issue. The forces of safeguarding peace and opposing colonialism resolutely safeguard the principles of the United Nations Charter and strive to make the United Nations play its due role; the forces of imperialism and colonialism attempt to use every opportunity to make the United Nations platform smoky and worsen the international atmosphere. Therefore, when the General Assembly announced its adjournment, not only was the Middle East issue unresolved, but also the so-called "Hungarian issue" was retained on the agenda due to the unreasonable attitude of the Western countries headed by the United States. This situation shows that within the United Nations, as in the current overall international situation, people must also be prepared to continue to wage intense struggles against imperialist aggression and various conspiracies.

    评第十一届联合国大会
    谭文瑞
    去年11月12日开幕的第十一届联合国大会，一再延长会期之后，已于3月8日暂时结束。开了差不多四个月的这一届联合国大会，如果根据各国人民对它的殷切期望来衡量，收获是不能令人满意的。本届会议所以未能对巩固和平和缓和国际紧张局势作出应有的贡献，应该由以美国为首的西方集团负责。
    本届大会是在国际局势十分复杂的情况下开始它的日程的。国际反动势力虽然在埃及和匈牙利两条战线上的冒险事业遭受了失败，但是依然不肯放弃煽动“冷战”的政策。它们一方面在中东地区加紧制造镇压各国民族独立运动的新阴谋；另一方面竭力想在全世界范围内掀起反苏反共的狂潮，以便给它们的侵略阴谋活动打掩护。各国爱好和平的人民为了维护和平和各国人民的独立和主权，就同帝国主义侵略势力展开了激烈斗争的又一个回合。这种激烈的斗争自然不能不反映到联合国大会上来。因此在大会上就表现出两条截然不同的路线：多数爱好和平的国家都努力想使大会发挥它维护世界和平和安全的作用，在缓和国际紧张局势方面有所作为；而以美国为首的西方侵略集团则竭尽其力要想束缚联合国的手脚，使这个组织继续成为它们的“冷战”工具。
    新血液带来新气象
    联合国成员的扩大，在一定程度上反映了和平力量和反殖民主义力量在联合国内的增强。上一届联大排除了美国等西方国家的阻碍，接纳了十六个新会员国，本届大会又为苏丹、摩洛哥、突尼斯和日本等国家打开了大门（由于美国顽固地坚持它的歧视政策，蒙古人民共和国仍然无理地被排斥在联合国之外）。这样，本届联大就有了八十个国家的代表参加（大会在休会的前夕又接纳了新诞生的加纳为会员国）。十个社会主义国家和二十五个曾经参加万隆会议的亚非国家在一起，将近占到了联合国全体成员国总数的一半。这种情况当然是不称美国统治集团的心意的。美国“基督教科学箴言报”就指出，美国在本届大会采取的政策，就是努力想要重整它的表决机器和恢复美国“已经丧失的势力和领导”。
    在本届大会中，至少有两件事情表明，美国统治集团是如何不遗余力地想要继续把持联合国这个国际组织。美国利用它的表决机器否决了印度所提出而为其他许多国家所支持的提案，阻止了把关于恢复我国代表权的问题列入大会的议程。虽然如此，实际上大会对于这个问题还是进行了激烈的辩论，许多国家的代表在发言中谴责了美国及其追随者反对国际关系正常化的做法。美国的立场遭到了比在上一届联大中广泛得多的反对，在那届大会上，支持讨论这个问题的有十二个国家，而这一回，却有二十五个国家支持印度的提案。而且正如 “华盛顿邮报”评论这次表决的一篇社论所说的，“有的国家在表决中弃权的行动是对美国的态度日益不同意的明证，而如果问问其他代表的真实想法，这种不同意还会更为广泛些。”难怪合众社记者蒂特索斯感叹：“这可能是美国能够得到足够的大会支持阻止接纳共产党中国的最后一年了。”其次，美国不顾联合国宪章和伦敦君子协定的规定，硬要把菲律宾选入安理会，从而强夺了东欧国家席位的行径，也是极其不得人心的，它同样遭到了道义上的严厉谴责。
    美国和侵略者一鼻孔出气
    联合国在制止英、法和以色列对埃及的武装侵略方面是起了积极作用的。在十一届联大开幕以前，联合国在去年11月初召开的紧急会议通过了决议，要求在埃及实行停火，并责成英、法、以色列侵略军队立即撤出埃及。当时，在世界舆论的强大压力下，英、法、以侵略者不得不停止它们的武装行动，但是三个侵略国的军队仍然占据着埃及的领土不肯撤退，使得中东地区继续处于战争随时可能再起的危险之中。因此，采取有效措施促令英、法、以三国的军队完全撤出埃及，成为十一届联大一个最紧迫的任务。
    在讨论埃及问题当中，绝大多数国家的代表异口同声地谴责英、法、以三国对埃及的侵略，要求它们马上从埃及撤军。三个侵略国却提出各种各样无理的先决条件，企图逃避执行联合国的决定。英国和法国拚命歪曲联合国紧急部队的职能，想利用联合国紧急部队来达到它们长期占领埃及的目的；以色列则甚至悍然拒绝把加沙地带和亚喀巴湾的蒂朗岛和赛纳菲尔岛交还埃及。而一向假装不同意英、法、以武装侵略的美国，却出来扮演帮助侵略者拖延撤军的角色，硬说联合国应该首先处理清理苏伊士运河之类的技术问题。但是在大多数国家的一致坚持下，大会于去年11月24日通过了亚非二十国的提案，再一次要求英、法、以遵守联合国决议立即撤退侵略军队。英、法两国看到势头不妙，才在去年12月22日把它们的侵略军队从埃及领土上撤走。但是另外一个侵略国以色列却依然不肯撤军。甚至在大会第六次通过勒令以色列撤退侵略军队的决议后，以色列还是蛮横无理地坚持它“完全有权”不让局势恢复到它对埃及发动侵略以前的原状。而大会后期的事态清楚地表明，以色列所以如此胆大妄为是有美国在幕后袒护这个侵略者。美国一方面阻止联合国对以色列实行制裁，另一方面用秘密“保证”来满足以色列的无理要求，事实上就是想利用联合国紧急部队实行长期占领加沙地带和亚喀巴湾地区的计划。正是以色列和它的美国保护人的捣蛋和阻挠，联合国在制止在中东的侵略这个问题上表现得相当的软弱无力，而且到现在还在中东问题上留下一个尾巴。这不能不使联合国的威信受到一定的打击。
    破天荒的捣乱行为
    应当指出，以美国为首的西方国家一开始就蓄意要转移联大对于像制止在中东的侵略行动这种迫切问题的注意。它们搬出了所谓“匈牙利问题”来打乱联大的议程，企图迫使大会纠缠在这种毫无意义的辩论上，而不能认真地去进行它的正常工作。
    每当联大要着手做一些正经的事情的时候，美国和它的追随者就强迫大会去讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”，而把一些重要的国际问题搁置一边。它们提出并且操纵大会非法通过了约有半打之多污蔑苏联和干涉匈牙利内政的议案。这简直是对联合国职权的极大侮辱。
    西方国家硬要把所谓“匈牙利问题”列入联大议程的行动就是违反联合国宪章的。宪章规定联合国无权过问一个国家的内政问题。匈牙利外长去年12月11日发表声明抗议联大干涉匈牙利内政，并宣布不参加所谓“匈牙利问题”的讨论，是完全正当的和必要的。
    不过，就是在讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”的过程中，情势对于那些企图掀起反苏反共歇斯底里的人们也并不是那么有利。苏联和其他社会主义国家的代表义正词严地揭露和谴责了西方集团的阴谋目的；并且列举出大量无可辩驳的事实来证明，假仁假义地装作同情匈牙利人民的那些人，就是在匈牙利策动反革命暴动的那些人。这些国家的代表还令人信服地指出，美国进行的颠复活动的范围远远不仅在匈牙利一个国家之内。苏联并在去年12月12日提出一项议案，要求大会讨论“美国对人民民主国家内政的干涉和它对这些国家的破坏活动”这样一个问题。这一项目虽然被列入了议程，而且对这个问题的讨论也证明了美国政府的确曾经并继续对许多国家进行着颠复活动，并把这种活动作为美国外交政策的一个组成部分，但是苏联提出的要求联合国谴责并制止美国这种活动的议案，却在美国的操纵下被特别政委会所否决。这样，联合国就又一次被阻止了履行它维护国家主权的神圣职责。
    反殖民主义浪潮势不可当
    1956年是反殖民主义运动空前高涨的一年，因此殖民主义问题是十一届联大议程上一个主要的项目。日益恶化的阿尔及利亚局势最引人注意，大会花了很长的时间讨论了这个问题。法国在过去一年中没有按照联合国的期望寻求这个问题的和平解决，反而变本加厉地采取军事镇压手段的做法，受到了许多国家的猛烈抨击。虽然亚非十八国要求给予阿尔及利亚人以自决权的提案在政委会中被殖民国家纠集的力量所扼杀，但是这个提案中主张根据联合国宪章的原则承认阿尔及利亚人民自决权的部分曾经获得多数通过。这就表明大多数国家都承认阿尔及利亚人民的自决权利。同时联大最后通过的折衷提案事实上也确认了联合国完全有权对阿尔及利亚问题采取行动。这决不是法国在会后散布的什么联合国大会已经同意“停止对阿尔及利亚的干涉”一类鬼话所能掩盖的。
    塞浦路斯问题第一次在联合国大会中展开了讨论，也是联合国中反殖民主义力量的一个胜利。许多国家的代表在讨论中谴责了英国的殖民政策，并支持塞浦路斯人民的自决要求。联大就这个问题通过的决议没有明确地责成英国满足塞浦路斯人民的自决愿望，但是它指出了塞浦路斯问题必须根据联合国宪章的原则和宗旨来求得和平民主和公正的解决，这实际上否定了英国以暴力代替谈判的政策。
    至于西伊里安问题，虽然主张设立一个三人斡旋委员会协助荷兰和印度尼西亚恢复谈判、根据联合国宪章的原则来解决西伊里安问题的十三国提案遭到无理否决，但是从讨论的过程和表决的结果都可以看出，多数国家都支持印度尼西亚收回西伊里安的立场。
    此外如本届联大决定结束原由英国统治的多哥的托管地位，通过苏联提出的早日给予其他五个托管地以独立或自治的议案等，都反映出了今天反殖民主义的潮流是如何的势不可当。
    值得注意的是一向伪装反对殖民主义的美国在讨论这些殖民主义问题中所持的态度。美国代表公然出来为英、法等国家的殖民主义立场辩护，反对联合国过问这些问题。这样，本届联大实际上就起了“照妖镜”的作用，它再一次暴露了美国殖民主义者的真面目，使得美国的那些反对殖民主义的花言巧语，愈来愈难以骗人。
    裁军问题只演了一幕过场戏
    裁军问题是本届大会应该处理的重要问题之一。苏联在去年11月17日就已提出了一项全面的裁军建议；在这届大会上，苏联还提出了主张召开联大特别会议讨论裁军问题以及要求各国立即停止试验核子武器的两项提案。这显示了苏联谋求解决裁军问题的真诚意愿。
    美国在联大开幕之前曾大肆散布空气说要在大会上提出一项新的裁军方案来促进裁军问题的解决，但是结果只拿出一个似是而非的笼统建议。这个建议甚至对禁止试验核子武器也提出了毫无道理的先决条件，它的目的显然是要使裁军工作倒退到开始阶段那种不着边际的争论上去。由于美国等西方国家的阻挠，大会对裁军问题未进行任何实际的讨论，而只把有关问题的一切建议交给联合国裁军委员会小组委员会去处理。这不能不被认为是本届大会的一大缺陷。
    这一届联合国大会的特点是在每一个重要的问题上都进行了反复的、激烈的斗争。维护和平和反对殖民主义的力量坚决维护联合国宪章的原则，力促联合国发挥它应有的作用；帝国主义和殖民主义的力量则企图利用每一个机会把联合国这个讲坛弄得乌烟瘴气，以恶化国际气氛。因此，在大会宣告休会的时候，不仅中东问题未了，而且由于美国为首的西方国家的无理态度还在议程上保留了所谓“匈牙利问题”。这种情形说明，在联合国内，也和当前的整个国际局势一样，人们还必须准备继续同帝国主义的侵略活动和各种阴谋进行紧张的斗争。
