　　Political Study and Its Help to Me
　　Student of Zhejiang University, Shen Zhiyuan
    Does political study have any effect on us engineering students? Here I would like to talk about my own experience.
    For the past six months, I have persisted in studying political theory. In addition to taking good notes in political classes, carefully reviewing and referencing some necessary reference books, I also read the newspaper every day and care about current affairs. Facts have proved that doing so not only helps my ideological cultivation but also greatly benefits my professional studies.
    First of all, political study solves the problem of direction. We will all shoulder the task of national construction in the future, but what we want to build is not something else, but socialism. This is an extremely glorious and arduous cause that predecessors have never done before. This requires us to improve our ideological awareness through political study and become conscious revolutionaries. Otherwise, it is difficult for us to imagine that a politically vague and passive person can become a good socialist builder.
    Learning is hard work, and I encountered many difficulties when I started studying. This requires me to have the determination to study hard and overcome difficulties. Where does the motivation for learning come from? Individualism? This is not feasible. The “enthusiasm” for learning that starts from individualism cannot last. This requires us to improve our awareness through political study and complete learning as a task assigned to us by the motherland.
    Marxism-Leninism is universally applicable. To study modern scientific theory, we must have a dialectical materialist viewpoint. We have studied the basic theory of dialectical materialism, which is of great benefit to our professional and basic courses. Strengthening the study of political theory does not weaken our study of professional and basic courses, but on the contrary, strengthens it.
    We cannot separate political study from professional study. There is a close connection between them. To train ourselves to be people with both ability and integrity, both are indispensable.
    As for the time spent on political study, according to my personal experience, arranging four or five hours a week (outside of class) is feasible. The problem lies in whether you are good at planning your time.
    I often hear that some revolutionary comrades, in the past, under the threat of serious white terror, risking their lives, were still working hard to study revolutionary theory. Today, we have such good conditions, and if we don't work hard in this area, we will be ashamed of them. I have not done enough in this regard and need to further improve myself.

### 政治学习对我的帮助

　　政治学习对我的帮助
　　浙江大学学生  沈致远
    政治学习对我们工科大学生来说究竟有没有作用呢？这儿我想谈谈自己的体会。
    半年来我坚持了政治理论的学习，除了上政治课记好笔记，认真复习和参考一些必要的参考书以外，并且每天看报，关心时事。事实证明，这样做不但对自己的思想修养有帮助，而且对专业学习也有很大好处。
    首先政治学习解决的是方向问题，我们将来都要负担起国家建设的任务，但是我们所要建设的不是别的，而是要建设社会主义，这是前人从来没有做过的极其光荣、艰巨的事业，这就要求我们能通过政治学习提高自己的思想觉悟，成为自觉的革命者。否则，我们很难想像一个政治上模糊消极的人，能够成为一个好的社会主义建设者。
    学习是艰苦的劳动，我在开始学习时的困难是很多的，这就需要自己有刻苦学习克服困难的决心。学习的动力从何而来呢？个人主义吗？这是不行的，从个人主义出发的学习“劲头”是不可能持久的，这就必须通过政治学习提高自己的觉悟，把学习当作祖国交给我们的任务来完成。
    马克思列宁主义是放之四海而皆准的。学习现代科学的理论，必须有辩证唯物主义观点，我们学习了辩证唯物主义的基本理论，这对我们的专业和基础课的学习都是有很大好处的。加强了政治理论学习，并不是削弱了我们对专业和基础课的学习，而恰恰相反，是对这方面的加强。
    我们不能把政治和业务学习对立起来，它们之间有密切的联系，要把我们自己锻炼成德才兼备的人，两者是缺一不可的。
    至于政治学习的时间问题，根据我个人的体会，每周安排四、五小时（指课外）是可以做到的。问题在于自己善于有计划地支配时间。
    我常听说：一些革命同志，他们过去在严重的白色恐怖的威胁下，冒着生命的危险，还在努力地学习革命的理论，今天我们有这样好的条件，如果不在这方面努力，是会愧对他们的。我在这方面做得还不够，还要进一步来提高自己。
