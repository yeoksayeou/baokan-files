    Reducing One Process, Saving Labor and Materials
    Qingdao No. 2 State-Owned Cotton Mill Successfully Spins Fine Yarn Directly from First-Pass Roving

    (Our report) On February 26th, the No. 2 Spinning Workshop of Qingdao No. 2 State-Owned Cotton Mill successfully used a double-process first-pass roving frame to directly supply fine yarn spinning machines. From now on, coarse spinning will eliminate one process.
    The fine yarn spinning machines equipped in this workshop are double-apron high-draft fine yarn spinning machines. The draft ratio generally designed for this type of fine yarn spinning machine is above eleven times, while the draft ratio currently used in the workshop is only 7.53 times. This not only fails to fully utilize the drafting capacity of this drafting device, but also affects the quality of the yarn due to the excessive speed of the apron, resulting in unstable drafting movement. The workshop discovered this problem early on but had not been able to resolve it reasonably. Since the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign, this issue has attracted the attention of workshop leaders and engineering technicians. On February 20th, the workshop held a special symposium of engineering technicians to study and improve the fine yarn spinning process design. After repeated research, it was discovered that the above-mentioned process design had extremely unreasonable phenomena. Technician Wu Jigang, based on the working principle of the double-apron high-draft device and the data being researched in China on spinning fine yarn from first-pass roving with ultra-high draft, proposed abolishing the second-pass roving frame and directly supplying the fine yarn spinning machine with the first-pass roving frame. After the meeting, with the support of the Party, government, and trade union, the technical personnel formulated a plan and started experiments. By the 26th, good results had been obtained: the irregularity rate of the yarn count decreased from the original 2.5%—3.36% to 2.15%, the neps and impurities and twist were very normal, the evenness was also better than before, and the strength reached the highest quality standard of the country; and it can save a lot of electricity, cotton, and labor.
    Currently, the leaders and technicians of this workshop are studying how to further improve the spinning quality of the yarn.

### 减少一道工序  节省人力物力  青岛国棉二厂用头道粗纱直接纺细纱成功

    减少一道工序  节省人力物力
    青岛国棉二厂用头道粗纱直接纺细纱成功
    本报讯  国营青岛第二棉纺织厂纺二车间2月26日利用双程式头道粗纱机直接供应细纱机纺纱获得成功。从此粗纺就省去了一道工序。
    这个车间所设备的细纱机是双皮圈大牵伸细纱机，这种细纱机一般设计的牵伸倍数均在十一倍以上，而目前车间所用的纺纱牵伸倍数只有七点五三倍。这样不仅不能充分发挥这种牵伸装置的牵伸能力，而且由于皮圈速度过高，造成的牵伸运动不够稳定，也影响了成纱质量。很早，车间即发现了这问题，一直未能合理解决。自从开展增产节约运动以来，这一问题才引起了车间领导人员和工程技术人员的重视。2月20日车间专门开了工程技术人员座谈会研究改进纺纱工艺设计。经反复研究才发现上述工艺设计中的极不合理现象。技术员吴继纲根据双皮圈大牵伸装置的工作原理和我国正在研究中的超大牵伸由头道粗纱纺出细纱物资料，提出了废除二道粗纺机，而以头道粗纺机直接供应细纱机纺纱的建议。会后技术人员在党政工会支持下订出了方案，开始试验，到26日已获良好结果：纱的支数不匀率由原来的2.5％—3.36％降为2.15％，棉结杂质和拈度均很正常，条干也较前好，强力达到了国家的最高品质指标；并且能够节省大量电力、棉花和人工等。
    目前这个车间领导人员和技术人员正研究进一步提高纱的纺出质量。
