Many elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled commune members in Fujian Province
Enjoy "Five Guarantees" treatment and have their lives ensured

    (Our dispatch) Fuzhou—Many elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled commune members in rural Fujian Province are receiving "Five Guarantees" treatment from agricultural cooperatives and are living happy lives. According to a survey of more than 1,100 cooperatives in 21 counties, including Jinjiang, Longxi, Nanjing, and Fu'an, more than 18,000 people are enjoying "Five Guarantees" treatment.

    Before liberation, these people were either wandering in foreign lands or begging along the way. Some had homes to live in, but they often worried about having congee for three meals a day, constantly sighing and lamenting their "bad fate." Now, their lives are secure. Each "Five Guarantees" household is guaranteed at least 360 catties of grain per year by the agricultural cooperative. The Chiling Township Agricultural Cooperative in Changtai County stipulates that each "Five Guarantees" household receives a monthly food allowance of 4.5 yuan, 400 catties of firewood, and two sets of clothes per year. When Hong A’jian, a "Five Guarantees" household member of the Xiamen Agricultural Cooperative in Fuding County, died last year, the cooperative cadres built a grave for him, made funeral clothes, bought a coffin, and attended the funeral.

    The living standards of most elderly people enjoying "Five Guarantees" treatment are higher than before joining the cooperative. According to a survey, the five "Five Guarantees" households in the Baofeng Cooperative in Nanjing County had an average monthly living expense of 3 yuan per person before joining the cooperative; now, the average is more than 9 yuan per person per month. They are all very satisfied with this situation. Therefore, they all want to do their best to participate in labor to reduce the burden on the cooperative. Lin Xin, a 65-year-old widow in the Baofeng Cooperative of Nanjing County, earned more than 100 yuan in work points last year by participating in light labor. Zeng Wan, a 108-year-old man in the Banzai Township Agricultural Cooperative of Pinghe, accumulates fertilizer for the cooperative every day and was named a labor model of the cooperative.

    Respect and care for the elderly have become common practice among commune members. Many women, young people, and children can actively fetch water, pound rice, deliver vegetables, and deliver firewood for them. (Dai Qitian)

    福建省许多老弱孤寡残废社员
    享受“五保”待遇生活有保障
    本报讯　福建省农村中许多老弱、孤寡、残废社员受到农业社的“五保”待遇，过着幸福的生活。据晋江、龙溪、南靖、福安等二十一个县一千一百多个社调查，享受“五保”待遇的有一万八千多人。
    解放前，这些人不是流浪异乡，便是沿途求乞，有的虽有家可居，但每天经常为三餐稀饭发愁，经常唉声叹气，自怨“命薄”。现在，他们的生活有了保障了。对每个“五保”户，农业社一年起码照顾粮食三百六十斤。长泰县赤岭乡农业社规定每月供给“五保”户伙食费四元五角，柴四百斤，一年衣服两套。福鼎县峡门农业社“五保”户洪阿鉴去年死亡，社干部替他筑坟、制寿衣、买棺木和参加送葬。
    凡享受“五保”待遇的老人，生活水平绝大部分比入社前提高。据调查，南靖县宝丰社五个“五保”户，入社前，他们的生活费用，每人每月平均三元；现在，每人每月平均可达九元多。对这种情况，他们都非常满意。因此，他们都想尽最后一点余力，争取参加劳动，以减轻社内的负担。南靖县宝丰社六十五岁老寡妇林心，去年一年参加轻劳动赚得的工分，就折款一百多元，平和坂仔乡农业社一百零八岁的老人曾晚，每天都为社积肥，被评为社的劳动模范。
    对老人的尊敬和关怀已经在社员中形成风气。很多妇女、青年、小孩，都能主动为他们挑水、舂米、送菜、送柴。　　（戴启天）
