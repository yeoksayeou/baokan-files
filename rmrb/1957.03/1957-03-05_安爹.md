　　Uncle An
　　Luo Xiangsheng
　　I worked in the Sanhe Agricultural Cooperative in Yueyang County for half a month and got to know many farmers. Now, when I close my eyes, I can still remember the faces of many of them, recall their names, and describe some of their personalities. The one I find most unforgettable is Hu Sandie – people all call him Uncle An. He is tall, with thick eyebrows and a square face, and his face is etched with several distinct wrinkles, but he doesn't look old. When he speaks, his voice is loud, and he habitually rubs his eyes with his large, rough hands that have done a lot of labor. At first glance, you wouldn't think he was an old man approaching sixty.

　　I first met him on the afternoon of January 9th. That day, drizzle was mixed with sleet, and the weather was bitterly cold. The cooperative members had all finished work early and gone home, but Uncle An was still digging and carrying pond mud all by himself, persisting until dinnertime, and coming back completely soaked. It snowed on the 12th and 13th. After the snow cleared, it was still cold working in the fields. The resident cadres and cooperative cadres went door-to-door early in the morning to urge people to work, but they could never find Uncle An. Uncle An got up even earlier than the cadres. As soon as it was light, he would lead his water buffalo to plow the fields on the hillside across the way. Since the transition to the advanced cooperative, this old man has accumulated nearly sixty workdays, which is the highest record in the entire cooperative.

　　These things deeply moved me, and I paid him a visit.

　　"Why do you love to work so much, Uncle An?" I asked.

　　"We old-fashioned people feel pain if we don't move; working makes us feel comfortable."

　　"Were you this fond of working before liberation?"

　　"Before liberation, I worked as a farmhand for thirty years, starting from the age of twelve, for six landlords and one rich peasant, and suffered bitterly. I don't understand much about the new theories, but I can tell you about the hardships.

　　"During the great drought of the Yi Chou year, I worked as a farmhand for Hu Hanwu. My family's two elders also rented one and a half mu of land, but we harvested nothing. Our family of four lived on grass. On the twenty-second day of the third month of the Bing Yin year, my parents died on the same day from illness and starvation. That year, I owed Hu Hanwu forty silver dollars, and I worked for him for ten years to pay it off." Uncle An's eyes turned red, and his throat choked up.

　　The topic shifted to the disasters of last year. Uncle An said, "Last year's disaster was much greater than the Yi Chou year. In our village, there were more than fifty consecutive days without rain. Last year, my family of three still received eleven shi of grain, twenty-five shi of sweet potatoes, and sixteen yuan in cash. The year before last, the harvest was average, and I only harvested eight shi of grain and fourteen shi of sweet potatoes. With the cooperative, a bad year is better than a good year. In addition, last year the government called for engaging in sideline occupations. My wife raised a pig, and last month I sold the pig to the government, and my family made cotton-padded clothes. In the Bing Yin year, both my parents starved to death, but this year I have food and clothing. The cooperative is really very good."

　　"Uncle An is old, but his heart is not," the villagers all complimented him like this. Last year, when the cooperative transitioned to an advanced cooperative, the old man was very enthusiastic. When the cooperative committee set the work points for tending cattle a bit low, some members didn't want to feed the cattle. Uncle An took the lead in bringing back a cow to feed himself. According to everyone, "Uncle An treats the cow better than his own son." When the cooperative's sweet potato vines were not enough, he used his own share of vines to feed the cow, and he also added a lot of late rice straw for the cow to eat. Since the beginning of winter, Uncle An has covered the top of the cattle pen with straw and stuffed the gaps in the walls with grass, and he often replaces the bedding with fresh straw for the cow to sleep on. The cow he feeds has grown fat and strong. Whenever it snows or rains, Uncle An always goes to the front and back of the village to walk around. On January 13th, he picked up fourteen plows and eight harrows from outside, washed them clean, and handed them over to the team's custodian. Uncle An doesn't hold any position in the cooperative, but he manages things he doesn't like. Some time ago, several upper-middle peasants in the cooperative were making trouble about withdrawing from the cooperative, and some poor peasants were also confused. Uncle An was very anxious and went from house to house, explaining the reasons and using analogies. What annoyed him the most was that his eldest son, Gelin, who had been separated from him for many years, was also making trouble about withdrawing from the cooperative. He said to me, "Gelin is an unfilial and disloyal wretch. He is harsh on his parents and has forgotten his roots. He wants to engage in business and freeload. It was hard for me to get through to him." There are three young men in the cooperative that Uncle An particularly dislikes, especially Hui Yazi. Hui Yazi has studied for a few years and always wants to go to the city. This year, even though the local area has suffered a disaster, he doesn't economize. He bought a pair of sneakers for more than five yuan and made new clothes out of blue khaki cloth to show off in the village. He doesn't work when the sun is shining, he just loafs around and teases women. Uncle An said, "It's shameful for him to even ask for relief. This kind of loafer is really useless."

　　During my time working in the Sanhe Cooperative, I really enjoyed chatting with Uncle An. The closer I got to him, the more I loved him. When I left the Sanhe Cooperative, I went to say goodbye to the old man. He understood what I was thinking and said, "Comrade Luo, the society will be run better and better. With our backs to the yellow earth and our feet on the ground, I will never leave the cooperative." It has been some time since I left the Sanhe Cooperative, but his tall figure, thick eyebrows, square face, and rough, dark fingers still linger in my mind. I can still often hear his loud voice: "We old-fashioned people feel pain if we don't move; working makes us feel comfortable."

    安爹
    罗祥生
    我在岳阳县三合农业社工作了半个月，结识了很多的农民。现在我合上眼睛，还能够想得起他们之中很多人的相貌，数得出他们的名字，讲得出他们的某些性格，其中最使我难于忘怀的是胡三爹——人们都称呼他安爹。高大的身材，浓眉方脸，面孔上挂上了几道鲜明的皱纹，但是显得并不衰老，讲起话来声音宏大，习惯地用他那双劳动的粗大的手掌擦擦眼睛。乍看起来，你就想不到他是一个年近花甲的老人。
    我第一次认识他是1月9号的下午，那天麻风夹着细雨，天气酷寒，社员们都提前收工回去了，安爹却独个儿自挖自担地挑塘泥，一直坚持到吃晚饭，回来混身都湿了。12、13那几天下了雪。雪后初晴，在田里作工夫还是冷的。驻社干部和社干部们清晨就挨户去催工，但是每次都找不着安爹。安爹比干部起得更早，天刚亮他就牵起水牛去对门山坡犁田去了。这位老人家自从转高级社以来，作了近六十个工，是全社的最高纪录。
    这些事情深深地打动了我，我向他作了一次访问。
    “您怎么这样爱劳动，安爹？”我问。
    “我们老古板人，不动就身上疼，做工夫才舒服。”
    “您解放前也这样爱劳动吗？”
    “解放前我从十二岁起先后作了三十年长工，帮了六个地主，一个富农，受尽了苦。新的道理我懂得不多，苦处我有讲的。
   “乙丑年闹天旱，我帮胡汉吾作长工。我家的两个老人还佃了一亩五分田，可是颗粒无收。老小四口吃草过日子。丙寅年三月二十二日父母亲连病带饿同一天死了。当年我欠下胡汉吾四十块银洋的账，我替他作了十年长工才还清”。安爹的眼圈红了，喉咙也哽咽起来。
    话题转到了去年的灾情上来。安爹说：“去年灾情比乙丑年大得多，我们村子里一次就连续有五十来天没下雨。去年我一家三口仍然分了十一石谷，二十五石红薯，进了十六块现钱。前年年成平常，我才打得八石谷，十四石薯，有了合作社，坏年成比好年成还强哩。加上去年政府号召搞副业，婆婆养了一头猪，前月我把猪卖给政府，一家人作了棉衣。丙寅年我父母双双饿死，今年我有吃有穿，合作社硬是好得很。”
   “安爹人老心不老”，村子里的群众都这样恭维他。去年转高级社，老头挺热心。转社时社委把看牛工分打低了点，社员们有的不想喂牛。安爹带头领回一条牛自己喂。照众人的说法“安爹看牛比看他的满仔还亲”。社里的薯藤不够，他拿自己分的藤喂牛，还添了许多晚谷草给牛吃。入冬以来，安爹把牛栏顶用稻草扎上盖棚，墙壁隙缝用草塞死，栏底经常换上新草让牛睡。他喂的这条牛长得膘肥劲足，滚瓜流油的。每逢落雪下雨，安爹总要到村前村后屋前屋后去转转，1月13号这天，他就从外面捡回十四张犁八张耙，洗得干干净净交给了队里的保管员。安爹在社里没有担任什么职务，但是他见了看不惯的事情就要管。前些时社里几户上中农闹退社，有的贫农也搞糊涂了。安爹非常着急，四处串门子，讲道理，打比方。最使他恼火的是与他分家多年了的大儿子戈林也闹退社。他向我说：“戈林这杂种一不孝二不忠，他刻薄父母，现在还忘了本，想搞生意吃便宜饭。我好容易才把他的思想打通。”社里有三个青年是安爹顶讨厌的，特别是灰伢子。灰伢子读过几年书，总想进城，今年地方上受了灾他也不节约，买了五块多钱一双的球鞋，作了蓝卡叽布新衣在村子里抖风，出太阳也不出工，东荡西游，调戏妇女。安爹说：“亏他出得口，还望救济，这样的二流子真不中用。”
    我在三合社工作的一段，顶喜欢找安爹聊天，越接近他我越热爱他。当我离开三合社的时候，我向老人去告别，他懂得我的心思，说：“罗同志，社会办得更好的，背朝黄土脚朝天，我也不离开社。”我离开三合社一些时候了，高大的身材，浓眉方脸，粗黑的手指还萦回在我的脑际。我耳边还常常响起他那宏亮的声音：“我们老古板人，不动就身上疼，做工夫才舒服。”
