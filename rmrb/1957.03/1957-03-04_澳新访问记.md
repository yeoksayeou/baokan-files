A Visit to Australia and New Zealand
By Xu Guangxiao, Head of the Chinese Arts Troupe to Australia and New Zealand

From September 23, 1956, to January 25 of this year, the Chinese Arts Troupe visited Australia and New Zealand at their invitation. We visited nine cities, including Christchurch, Wellington, and Auckland in New Zealand, and Sydney, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth in Australia, performing a total of seventy-five shows for an audience of over 120,000 people. In Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, we made two television broadcasts. Approximately 1.5 million people watched the Chinese Peking Opera television broadcasts.

The Chinese Arts Troupe was the first to visit and perform in Australia and New Zealand in history. We were warmly welcomed and treated by the local governments and people everywhere we went. The people of both countries gave us a profound impression by their hospitality and sincere desire for world peace.

Every performance by the Chinese Arts Troupe was crowded with audiences, and every seat was filled. Almost every performance required three to seven curtain calls. Some performances, such as the "Red Silk Dance," "Lotus Dance," and "Yao Folk Dance," were requested to be repeated almost every time. We received many congratulatory letters and telegrams in every city, expressing warm appreciation for Chinese art. After the performances, many people often waited outside the theater to ask the actors for autographs and photos, some just wanted to see the Chinese guests again, and they didn't leave until late at night. The closing performance in Melbourne was the most unforgettable. When the audience enthusiastically presented flowers to the Chinese actors, thousands of people threw colorful ribbons from below the stage, from the second floor, and from the third floor, creating a magnificent and beautiful spectacle. Such a beautiful and moving scene, it is said, has never been seen in the Australian theater community.

Australian and New Zealand newspapers, magazines, and radio commentaries gave high praise to the Chinese Arts Troupe. The Australian "Sun" used "a wonderful world of exquisite skills and colors" to describe the magnificence of the stage. The New Zealand "Dominion" used the same tone to describe it, saying, "Dazzling and eclipsing everything." Many commentaries compared the richness and variety of Chinese Peking Opera and dance to a "never-ending kaleidoscope." Programs such as "Yandang Mountain," "San Cha Kou," "Havoc in Heaven," "Water Flooding Jinshan Temple," and "Tiger Hunting" were highly praised for their humor and thrilling action. Programs such as "Autumn River," "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet," "The Drunken Concubine," "The Trial of Yuangmen," "The Empty City Stratagem," and "Farewell My Concubine" were also well received, especially the humor and imitation movements in "Autumn River," which were unanimously praised by all newspapers. Dance programs such as "Lotus Dance" and "Red Silk Dance" also made a very good impression. A review of Chinese art in the New Zealand "News" can illustrate the unanimous feelings of many viewers. The newspaper commented: "The brilliant scenes of traditional Chinese classical art present neither the ethereal fairyland imagined by Westerners nor the vulgar sentiments favored by people living in narrow circles, but a fiery vitality."

Many friends in Australia have repeatedly told us: "The Australian public opinion has never been consistent on any issue or any matter, but the enthusiastic support and praise for the Chinese Arts Troupe has been completely consistent, which has never happened in our history." From these simple words, we deeply felt the strength of the Australian people's friendship with the Chinese people.

Almost all of the more than 20,000 overseas Chinese living in Australia and New Zealand, regardless of age or gender, scrambled to watch the performances of the motherland's arts troupe. Many people watched it again and again, some even watched it more than a dozen times. Some overseas Chinese followed the troupe from one city to another, traveling thousands of miles and running to many cities. When it was time to say goodbye, many people shed tears and were reluctant to part. In cities such as Auckland, Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne, where overseas Chinese live in relatively concentrated areas, there were Chinese restaurants opened by overseas Chinese. They were afraid that we would not be used to eating Western food, so they made Chinese food for the arts troupe. Wherever there were overseas Chinese living, we were warmly welcomed and meticulously cared for. In Wellington, Auckland, Sydney, and Melbourne, we were repeatedly given grand welcomes and receptions by hundreds or even thousands of overseas Chinese. Everywhere we could hear the overseas Chinese singing songs of the motherland, and many overseas Chinese could sing songs such as "The East is Red" and "Ode to the Motherland." Overseas Chinese are very hardworking abroad, living by their own labor. They always miss their motherland and yearn for it. They cooperate friendly and closely with the people of Australia and New Zealand, and respect the local government's laws and regulations. The spirit of unity and mutual assistance of the overseas Chinese and their actions of loving the motherland deeply moved all members of the arts troupe and greatly educated us.

Australia and New Zealand are two dominions of the United Kingdom, and both countries have only been around for a hundred and several decades. The indigenous people of New Zealand are the Maori, who look very much like yellow people. According to the research of Dr. Dowk, a famous historian in New Zealand, the Maori people floated to New Zealand Island in wooden boats from southern China during the Tang Dynasty. Whether this statement is reliable remains to be further studied. The Maori are a very hardworking and brave nation. They have always preserved their own language, customs, and ancient myths and legends. Maori songs and dances fully demonstrate the characteristics of this strong nation. It is said that there were originally more than 300,000 Maori people. They have repeatedly bravely resisted the armed invasion of British imperialism. Many people were brutally massacred in the wars. Now there are only 130,000 Maori people, and most of them are gradually being assimilated by the European way of life. The fate of the Australian Aborigines is even more miserable than that of the Maori. They are still living a primitive life and are in danger of extinction. It is said that twenty years ago there were still more than 60,000 Australian Aborigines, but now there are only a few thousand left. They are driven to desolate deep mountains and hot deserts, suffering inhuman treatment, and their lives are very miserable.

The scenery of both Australia and New Zealand is very beautiful, especially New Zealand. The whole country is full of green pastures and dense green forests. The whole country is like a large garden. However, industry and agriculture in New Zealand are not very developed. The most developed is animal husbandry. New Zealand has only more than two million people, mainly concentrated in several larger cities. We traveled to all the famous cities in New Zealand and scenic spots such as Rotorua Hot Springs Mountain, Waitomo Caves, Whakarewarewa Thermal Area, and Mount Hutt. We also visited New Zealand schools, libraries, museums, art galleries, factories, and water conservancy projects. These tours and visits gave us a very good impression. In addition, we watched the wonderful performances of New Zealand amateur theater groups and famous singers and dancers, and learned Maori dances and songs.

Australia is bounded by the Pacific Ocean on one side and the Indian Ocean on the other. More than two-thirds of Australia's nine million people live in cities along the Pacific coast, and most other areas are almost completely uninhabited. The climate in Australia is much drier than in New Zealand, and the weather is also relatively hot. In places like Brisbane and Perth, it rarely rains all year round. In summer, the grass is a piece of withered yellow, and even the leaves of many trees are ocher-yellow. Australia's industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and cultural and educational undertakings are more developed than New Zealand's. In Australia, we also visited some schools, factories, national libraries, museums, and art galleries, toured the famous Sydney Zoo, and admired Australian paintings and sculptures. In addition, outstanding Australian artists also organized several wonderful performances of dramas, operas, ballets, and musical performances for us. Famous Australian musicians also taught Chinese actors to sing Australian songs. Chinese artists and Australian artists established close friendships in a short period of time.

We recall the enthusiastic words of many friends, vividly expressing the sincere wishes of the peace-loving and friendly people of New Zealand and Australia. Mr. Bertram, a New Zealand writer who had been to China, once said meaningfully: "The visit and performance of the Chinese Arts Troupe will not only leave a deep impression on people, but also leave a lasting impact on New Zealand." Mr. Burns, an Australian writer, sincerely expressed the deep friendship of the Australian people towards the Chinese people at a welcome meeting in Brisbane. He said: "We do not believe in the words of the British poet Kipling that 'East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet.' The vast ocean surrounds the world, not to separate people, but to connect people. The Pacific Ocean washes our land and also washes your land. We welcome you like close neighbors!" Yes, the friendship of the people connects us.

The 600 million Chinese people will always be friendly to the people of Australia and New Zealand. We firmly believe that no force can stop the further development of the friendly relations between the people of China, Australia, and New Zealand. (Attached pictures)

    澳新访问记
    中国访澳新艺术团团长  徐光霄
    从1956年9月23日到今年1月25日，中国艺术团应邀到澳大利亚和新西兰访问演出。我们到过新西兰的克里斯丘吉、惠灵顿、奥克兰和澳大利亚的悉尼、布利斯班、堪培拉、墨尔本、阿得雷德、伯斯等九个城市，一共演出七十五场，观众约十二万多人。在澳大利亚的悉尼和墨尔本曾作了两次电视广播，观看中国京剧电视广播的观众约一百五十万人。
    中国艺术团是历史上第一次到澳新两国访问演出。我们到处都受到当地政府和人民的热情的欢迎和隆重的招待。两国人民的热情好客和对世界和平的真诚愿望，给了我们极为深刻的印象。
    中国艺术团每一次演出都是观众拥挤座无虚席。差不多每一场的每一个节目都要谢幕三次至七次之多，有的节目如“红绸舞”、“荷花舞”、“徭族舞曲”等，观众几乎每场都要求重演。我们每到一个城市都收到很多观众的祝贺信件和电报，对中国的艺术表示热烈的赞赏。在演出结束后，剧院门前经常有很多人围着等候演员签名留念，有的只是为着再看一眼中国客人，直等到深夜还不散去。最使人难忘的是在墨尔本的闭幕演出。当观众热情地向中国演员献花时，成千的人从台下，从二层楼和三层楼向台上抛掷五光十色的彩带，形成一幅绚烂绮丽的奇观。这样美丽动人的场面，据说在澳大利亚戏剧界是从来没有过的。
    澳大利亚和新西兰的报纸、杂志和广播评论，对中国艺术团给予很高的评价。澳大利亚“太阳报”用“绝艺和色彩的奇妙世界”来形容舞台场面的壮观。新西兰“自治领报”用同样的笔调形容说：“光彩夺目，使一切黯然失色”。很多评论对中国的京剧和歌舞的丰富多采，比作“层出不穷的万花镜”。对“雁荡山”“三岔口”“闹天宫”“水漫金山”“猎虎”等节目的幽默和惊险开打，均评价极高。对“秋江”“拾玉镯”“贵妃醉酒”“辕门会”“空城计”“霸王别姬”等节目，也都给予好评，特别是对“秋江”一剧的风趣和模拟动作，各报均一致大加赞美。舞蹈节目如“荷花舞”“红绸舞”也造成极好的印象。新西兰的“新闻报”对中国艺术的评论可以说明很多观众的一致的观感，该报评论说：“传统的中国古典艺术的光辉场面所表现的既不是西方人所幻想的缥缈仙境，也不是生活在狭隘圈子里的人们所嗜好的庸俗情趣，而是火热的生命力。”
    澳大利亚有很多朋友曾多次对我们说：“澳大利亚的舆论界在任何问题和任何事情上，从来没有一致过，但是对中国艺术团的热烈支持和称赞则是完全一致的，这在我国历史上是从来没有过的事情。”从这简单的几句话里，使我们深深感到澳大利亚人民对中国人民友谊的力量。
    侨居在澳新两国的二万多华侨，无论男女老幼几乎全部都争前恐后地观看了祖国艺术团的演出。有不少人看了一次又一次，有的甚至连续看了十几次。有的华侨从这一城跟随到那一城，一连跟随艺术团走了几千里路，跑了好多个城市，临离别时有很多人流泪不忍分手。在奥克兰、悉尼、布利斯班、墨尔本等华侨聚居比较集中的城市，都有华侨开设的中国饭馆，他们怕我们吃西餐吃不惯，就替艺术团做中国饭。凡是有华侨居住的地方，我们到处都受到华侨的热情的欢迎和无微不至的照顾。在惠灵顿、奥克兰、悉尼、墨尔本，我们曾多次受到几百人甚至上千华侨的盛大欢迎和招待。到处都可以听到华侨歌唱祖国的歌声，很多华侨都会唱“东方红”“歌唱祖国”等歌曲。华侨在国外都很勤劳，靠自己的劳动生活，他们时时想念着祖国，向往着祖国。他们和澳新两国人民都很友好地亲密合作，并尊重当地政府的法律制度。华侨团结互助的精神和他们热爱祖国的行动，使艺术团全体团员深为感动，并使我们受到很大的教育。
    澳大利亚和新西兰是英国的两个自治领，这两个国家都只有一百几十年的历史。新西兰的土著人民是毛利族，他们的样子很像黄种人。据新西兰有名的历史学家道克博士的考证，认为毛利族是在唐代由中国的南部坐木船漂流到新西兰岛上来的。这个说法是否可靠，尚待进一步研究。毛利族是一个很勤劳很勇敢的民族，他们一直保存着自己的语言、风俗习惯和古老的神话传说。毛利人的歌唱和舞蹈，充分表现了这个强悍民族的特点。据说毛利族原来有三十多万人，他们曾多次地英勇抵抗过英帝国主义的武力侵略，在战争中有很多人遭到残酷的屠杀，现在毛利族仅有十三万人，并且大部分人逐渐为欧洲生活方式所同化了。澳洲土人的命运，比起毛利族来更为凄惨，他们至今仍在过着原始人的生活，几乎有灭种的危险。据说二十年前澳洲土人还有六万多人，现在仅仅剩下几千人了。他们被驱赶到荒凉的深山和炎热的沙漠地带，受着非人的待遇，生活十分悲惨。
    澳大利亚和新西兰这两个国家的风景都非常幽美，特别是新西兰，全国到处是绿色的牧场和密密的绿色的丛林，整个国家就像一个大花园一样。但是新西兰的工业和农业都不很发达，最发达的是畜牧业。新西兰全国仅二百多万人，主要集中在几个较大的城市里。我们游历了新西兰全国所有著名的城市和罗托洛热泉山、维多莫山洞、瓦拉济跳舞泉、舍脱雪山等名胜。我们还参观了新西兰的学校、图书馆、博物馆、艺术馆、工厂和水利工程。这些游览和参观都给了我们很好的印象。此外，我们还观看了新西兰业余剧团和著名歌唱家、舞蹈家的精彩表演，并学习了毛利族的舞蹈和歌唱。
    澳大利亚两岸一边是太平洋，一边是印度洋。全澳大利亚九百万人口有三分之二以上都集中居住在太平洋沿岸的城市里，其他大部分地区几乎完全没有人居住。澳大利亚的气候比新西兰要干燥得多，天气也比较热，像布利斯班和伯斯等地一年四季很少下雨，夏天草色一片枯黄，连许多树木的叶子也都呈现赭黄色。澳大利亚的工业、农业、畜牧业、文化教育事业都比新西兰发达。我们在澳大利亚也参观了一些学校、工厂、国家图书馆、博物馆、艺术馆，游览了悉尼著名的动物园，欣赏了澳大利亚的绘画、雕刻。此外，澳大利亚的优秀的艺术家们还单独为我们组织了几次话剧、歌剧、芭蕾舞和音乐演奏等项节目的精彩表演，澳大利亚著名的音乐家还教会了中国演员唱澳大利亚歌曲。中国艺术家和澳大利亚艺术家在短短的时间里建立了亲密的友谊关系。
    我们回忆起许多朋友的热情的话语，生动地表达了爱好和平与友谊的新西兰人民和澳大利亚人民的真诚的意愿。曾经到过中国的新西兰作家贝特兰先生，有一次意味深长地说：“中国艺术团的访问演出，不仅给人留下了深刻的印象，而且将给新西兰留下久远的影响。”澳大利亚作家伯恩斯先生在布利斯班的一次欢迎会上，真诚地表达了澳大利亚人民对中国人民的深厚的友好感情，他说：“我们不相信英国诗人吉卜林所说‘东方是东方，西方是西方，永远不能相遇’的话，辽阔的大洋环绕世界，不是要把人们隔开，而是要把人们联系起来。太平洋冲洗着我们的国土，也冲洗着你们的国土，我们像近邻似的欢迎你们！”是的，人民的友谊把我们联系起来了。
    六万万中国人民对澳大利亚人民和新西兰人民永远是友好的，我们坚信没有任何力量能够阻止中、澳、新三国人民友好关系的进一步发展。（附图片）
