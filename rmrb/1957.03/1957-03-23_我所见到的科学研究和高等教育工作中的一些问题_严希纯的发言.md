After listening to Chairman Mao's instructions at the enlarged meeting of the Supreme State Conference, as well as Premier Zhou Enlai's and Vice Premier Li Fuchun's reports, I was deeply moved and excited. Moved by the greatness of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and excited by the great success our socialist construction has achieved under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, with new successes on the horizon. I have been deeply educated by these three reports. I will definitely work hard in the direction indicated by these reports in the future. I also agree with the work report made by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC.

I work in a scientific institution—the National Bureau of Metrology, and I also work in the Science and Technology Group of the CPPCC National Committee. Therefore, I would like to talk about some of the problems I have encountered in my work and inspections regarding scientific research, higher education, and the treatment of senior intellectuals.

In the more than seven years since liberation, our country's scientific research and higher education have made astonishing progress, which is a fact obvious to all. The introduction made by President Guo Moruo of the Chinese Academy of Sciences at the enlarged meeting of the Supreme State Conference on March 1st fully demonstrated how rapid the development of scientific research in China is. When we inspected several universities in Beijing, we saw that several schools that had been established for only two or three years had thousands of students and extremely rich equipment. Everyone who inspected them marveled at the speed of development, which is absolutely impossible in European and American capitalist countries.

However, in the process of this rapid development, there are still some problems:

	(1)	Problems Arising from the March Towards Science. In my opinion, the meaning of the March Towards Science was originally to hope that everyone already engaged in or wanting to engage in science would work hard in their respective positions in a down-to-earth manner. However, the relevant departments regarded the training of associate doctors as a good way to advance towards science. However, many university authorities reflected that after this method was implemented, many teachers opposed teaching work to research work, thinking that taking the associate doctor exam was the only way to advance towards science, and that there was no future in teaching work. Hospitals reflected that some doctors reduced their clinical work to prepare for the associate doctor exam. Some people say that this is not advancing towards science but advancing towards the associate doctor, which is indeed the case. This invisibly encourages young people to leave their jobs and concentrate on taking the associate doctor exam, which I am afraid is not a good way to advance towards science.

From the perspective of the employment situation of college graduates as a whole, many are able to work with peace of mind, but there are also many graduates who, after arriving at institutions, factories, or research institutions, are unwilling to do arduous but basic scientific work, such as calculation, drawing, observation, etc., thinking that this is not the road to becoming an expert. I have seen several young people in scientific institutions ask professors or leaders for guidance. After careful questioning, it turned out that they all regarded laboratory work as not the way to become an expert. This is another side effect of the policy of cultivating associate doctors.

	(2)	Insufficient Respect for Teachers and Their Teachings. Some university leaders (such as presidents and vice presidents) regard professors as subordinates and are not respectful enough in terms of etiquette. The influence is that teenagers in their teens who do personnel work can casually call a professor or expert to the office to talk. Professors have no right to participate in the work of deciding courses, and the opinions of non-Party professors are rarely valued. What is especially bad is that when students fail the exam, so-called guidance committees and other organizations will come forward to ask the professor to allow him to retake the exam again and again (up to four or five times), and hint that he must pass. This kind of behavior that does not respect academics is what scientists are most dissatisfied with, and it directly contributes to the atmosphere of students not respecting teachers, and indirectly makes students unable to study independently, which is not in line with the spirit of respecting teachers and their teachings and cultivating future generations.

In addition, there is a lack of attention to scientists with expertise and experience who are old and frail. Many schools and institutions only know how to use young and strong people, but do not know the value of these elderly scientists. You must know that such experts are very valuable as long as they can offer advice. It is not in line with the policy of mobilizing all positive forces to serve socialist construction to determine his value solely based on how much time he can teach or whether he can go to the office to work.

	(3)	Universities Do Not Pay Enough Attention to Basic Sciences, and Majors Are Divided Too Finely. At present, some college graduates have the phenomenon of being uneasy in their positions. In addition to the reasons listed in the first item above, another reason is that the majors in colleges and universities are divided too finely. After students go to the work departments, they all feel that what they have learned is not what they are using, and they can even sue the employing agencies on this basis, saying that they have not given them consistent learning and application. Another serious phenomenon is that although the majors these students learn are detailed, the basic courses of mathematics, physics, and chemistry are generally low. In fact, the emergence of these situations cannot be blamed on the youth, but only that there is a problem with our higher education system.

	(4)	Lack of Books and Instruments. Everyone has reflected a lot about the difficulty of instruments, so I won’t talk about it here. The supply of foreign books is related to foreign exchange, so I won’t talk about it here either. Let’s just talk about the supply of domestic books. Because of the emphasis on planning and fear of stockpiling funds, the institutions engaged in scientific publishing are unwilling to print too many copies of scientific books and periodicals, which is originally justified, but it is also wrong to cause reader dissatisfaction because the printing is too small and readers cannot buy them. When I worked at the Science Publishing House of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1954, scientists (this was only scientists in Beijing, and there were more opinions from outside Beijing) often protested that they could not buy the Science Publishing House’s journals (specialized and popular), because they were sold out as soon as they were published. I once suggested printing an extra hundred copies of each (the actual demand is definitely more than this number), but someone said that they were afraid that they would not be sold, that there would be no place to stack them, and that funds would be stockpiled, so this matter was not discussed. Now this phenomenon does not seem to have improved, because I still have evidence to prove it. I don't understand why we don't think about how to improve the distribution work, but only focus on stockpiling funds. This is something that I can't understand no matter what. Of course, this phenomenon cannot be blamed solely on the publishing house. The most important thing is to ask the publishing management agencies to pay more attention, because all publishing issues must be decided by the publishing management agencies.

	(5)	Human Resources and Equipment Are Not Used Rationally. At present, the lack of scientific and technological cadres and the lack of instruments and equipment are indeed facts. But on the other hand, there is a phenomenon of waste of human resources and equipment (especially instruments): the former situation is that there are many people who do not use what they have learned and cannot go to the positions they want; the latter situation is that some factories and schools have instruments with precision they do not need. If these phenomena are to be adjusted, it cannot be solved simply by using official documents to transfer or allocate them, because these institutions, factories, or schools can say that they need them themselves, making you unable to refute them. As for the cadres themselves proposing to return to the team or requesting to be transferred to a position suitable for their own preferences, they will immediately be considered not to be working with peace of mind, and they will be given a bad evaluation in the future, so that these cadres dare not make their own demands. Therefore, to achieve consistency in learning and application, we must think of feasible methods. How to solve this problem (people and equipment) is really a big problem rather than a small problem.

In addition to the above-mentioned problems, there are many problems in the scientific and technological circles, as we have heard in the speeches in the past few days. Of course, these problems are only shortcomings in the progress. However, in order to do a good job in national work, in line with the principle of blaming the virtuous in the Spring and Autumn Annals, I would like to analyze the causes of these problems from my point of view.

I believe that the emergence of these problems is mainly due to:

	(1)	There is no good cooperation between Party members and non-Party members. Responsible Party members, especially Party members responsible for scientific and technological work, do not fully listen to the opinions of non-Party members and do not humbly study on their own; (2) Some people who lead higher education and some people who lead scientific work regard running higher education and scientific work as general as leading the army or running factories and demand to see results as soon as possible; (3) Other departments related to education or scientific research have not achieved good cooperation, such as the Ministry of Foreign Trade, the Ministry of Commerce, etc., have not provided convenience for higher education and scientific research work in supplying instruments and equipment; (4) The agencies responsible for higher education vacillate in their views on scientific research and education work. In the past, they only valued teaching, regarding the work of professors as only teaching. Since the March Towards Science was proposed, it seems that they have somewhat valued the so-called researchers and despised "teaching craftsmen." Now I hear that they are going to put the focus of research on universities, because the Soviet Union is also changing. I am not against changing, but I hope that everything will be carefully considered before changing, and that we will not change simply because the Soviet Union is changing.

I feel that the emergence of these problems did not begin today, and the reflection is not the first time. The reason why they have not been resolved is mainly because everyone takes care of the convenience of their own departments and does not proceed from the overall interests. For example, how to do a good job in the supply of books and instruments must be solved by the senior leaders of each department. Some problems cannot even be solved by a single department. Therefore, several departments need to coordinate together.

Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to introduce the work of the National Bureau of Metrology to everyone; because the term "metrology" is not familiar to many people, there is not enough understanding of our bureau. I once received a letter with "Grain Measurement Bureau" written on the envelope; even in factories, there are still inconsistent explanations. For example, the metrology workshop of Anshan Iron and Steel Company only manages weighing instruments. They interpret the word "measurement" as the meaning of quantity. "Metrology" is the English word meterology. The Bureau of Metrology is a scientific institution. Its main task is to ensure the consistency and accuracy of the measuring instruments used in industry and scientific research and to use them correctly. Its work is the same as the scientific work done by the Soviet Union's Committee on Standards, Measures and Measuring Instruments under the Council of Ministers, the United States' National Bureau of Standards, and the United Kingdom's National Physical Laboratory. Therefore, it is urgently needed for my country's industrial construction, scientific research, and trade. However, our bureau has been established for nearly two years and has not yet been able to serve industry and science. The main reason is that our work has not received the due attention from all parties. Some people say it is very important, and some people say that it is not yet sufficient to do this work in China. Everyone has different opinions. At present, we have not received the due scientists and engineers to work; the necessary basic construction funds have not yet been obtained. I hope everyone will support us. I dare to boldly say that as long as we do a good job in metrology, the losses caused by the lack of accurate measuring instruments in today's industry and domestic and foreign trade will be greatly reduced.

The above is all factual. However, I hope everyone will discuss and give guidance on whether my views are correct.

　　我所见到的科学研究和高等教育工作中的一些问题
　　严希纯的发言
    我听了毛主席在最高国务会议扩大会议上的指示以及周恩来总理和李富春副总理的报告之后，深深感动和兴奋。感动的是中国共产党和毛主席的伟大，兴奋的是在党和毛主席的正确领导之下我国社会主义建设已经获得了很大的成功而新的成功也已在望。从这三个报告，我受了很深的教育。今后一定循着这些报告所指示的方向努力工作。我亦同意陈叔通副主席代表政协第二届全国委员会常委会所作的工作报告。
    我是在一个科学机关——国家计量局工作的，在政协全国委员会亦是在科学技术组工作。因此，我想从我在工作中和视察中所接触到的一些关于科学研究、高等教育和对待高级知识分子的工作等各方面的问题谈谈。
    解放以后七年多来，我们国家的科学研究工作和高等教育都有了惊人的发展，这是有目共见的事实。中国科学院郭沫若院长3月1日在最高国务会议扩大会议上对中国科学院所作的介绍，充分地说明了中国的科学研究的发展速度是如何大。我们在视察北京几个高等学校的时候，看到几个成立仅仅二、三年的学校都是动辄几千人，设备亦极丰富，所有视察的人都惊叹这是欧美资本主义国家所绝对没有的发展速度。
    不过，在这种飞速发展的过程中，也还存在一些问题：
      （一）向科学进军所产生的问题。向科学进军的意义，照我看来原是希望一切已从事或想从事科学的人各在本位上脚踏实地努力工作的意思。然而，有关部门却把培养副博士看成是一个向科学进军的好办法。但许多高等学校的当局都反映，从这个办法实施后，不少教师把教学工作和研究工作对立起来，以为考副博士才是向科学进军，担任教学工作无出路。医院则反映，有些医师减少了临床工作去准备考副博士的功课。有人说，这不是向科学进军而是向副博士进军，实在是事实。这种无形中鼓励青年脱离本位工作去专心于考副博士恐怕不是科学进军的好办法。
    从整个高等学校毕业生就业的情况说，有许多是能安心工作的，但也有不少毕业生到了机关、工厂或研究机构后，不愿做艰苦的而却是基础的科学工作，例如计算、描图、观测等，以为这不是作专家的道路。我曾看见好几个科学机关的青年向教授或领导人要求指示方向，仔细一问，原来他们都把实验室工作看为不是到专家的路。这亦是培养副博士政策的另一副作用。
    （二）尊师重道不够的问题。有些高等学校的领导人（例如校长、副校长）把教授们看成下级，在礼貌上不够尊重，其影响是作人事工作的十几岁的青年也可以随便把一个教授或专家叫到办公地方来谈话。决定课程的工作，教授们无权参与，党外教授的意见很少被重视。尤其不好的是，学生考不及格时，会有所谓辅导委员会之类的组织出面向教授请求准许他一再补考（有至四、五次之多的），并暗示必须及格。这种不尊重学术的行为，是科学家所最不满意的，而且直接助长了学生不尊敬师长的风气，间接使学生不能自力求学，对尊师重道和培养后代的精神都是不符合的。
    另外就是具有专长和经验而年老力衰的科学家有不被人重视的事情。不少学校和机关都只知道用年青力壮的人。而不知道这些老年的科学家的可贵。要知道这样的专家，只要他能提提意见就是很宝贵的。单从他能上多少时间的课，能到办公室办公否来定他的价值是不符合调动一切积极力量来为社会主义建设服务的政策的。
      （三）高等学校重视基础科学不够，专业分得过细。目前一部分大学毕业生就业后有不安于位的现象，除上述第一项中所列原因外，另一个原因是高等学校的专业分得太细，学生到工作部门后都感到自己用非所学，甚至可以这个理由控告用人的机关，说没有给他们学用一致。还有一个严重的现象是这些学生所学的专业虽细，但基础课的数学、物理、化学，一般都较低。其实这些情况的产生，不能怪青年，只能说我们的高等教育的制度有问题。
      （四）图书仪器缺乏。仪器困难问题，大家反映很多，这里不谈。国外图书的供应，因为有外汇关系，这里也不谈。只谈国内图书供应吧。因为强调计划，怕积压资金，搞科学出版工作的机构对科学书刊的印数都不肯多，这原是有理由的，但因印得过少，读者买不到，引起读者不满，则也是不对的。当1954年我在中国科学院科学出版社工作时，科学家们（这还只是北京的科学家，京外的意见更多）常常抗议科学出版社的期刊（专门的和普及的）他们买不到，因为一出就完。我曾经提议每种多印一百本（实际上需要量决不只此数），但有人说怕销不出，无处堆放，积压资金，此事就不谈了。现在此现象似乎还未改进，因为我还有事实证明。我不明白，不从如何改进发行工作上想法而只是着眼在积压资金上，这是无论如何也想不通的。当然，这种现象，不能单责备出版社，最主要的还要请出版管理的机构多多注意才行，因为出版的一切问题都要出版管理机构决定的。
      （五）人材设备没有合理使用。目前缺乏科学技术干部和缺乏仪器设备确是事实。但另一方面却又有人材和仪器浪费
  （特别是仪器）的现象：前一种情况是有许多学非所用的人，不能到他们所想的岗位上去；后一种情况是若干工厂学校拥有它们所不需要的精度的仪器。这种现象，如要加以调整，单以公文去调用或调拨是不能解决的，因为这些机关、工厂或学校可以说他们自己需要，使你无话可驳。至于干部自己提出归队或者要求调到适合自己所喜爱的岗位上去呢，又会马上被认为不安心工作，以后对他就要加以不好的评语，以至这类干部不敢提出自己的要求。所以要做到学用一致，还要想出可行的办法才行。这问题（人与器）应当如何解决，实在是大问题而不是小问题。
    除了上述几个问题外，科学技术界存在的问题，从这几天我们所听到的发言中，还有不少。当然这些问题仅是前进中的缺点。不过为了把国家工作作好，本着春秋责备贤者的道理，我想从我的看法分析一下这些问题产生的原因。
    我认为这些问题的产生，主要是由于：
  （一）党员与非党员之间没有很好的合作，负责的党员，特别是负责有关科学技术工作的党员没有充分听取党外人士的意见自己又不虚心研究；（二）某些领导高等教育的人和某些领导科学工作的人把办高等教育和科学工作看成像带军队或办工厂那样一般化并且要求早日见效；（三）与教育或科学研究有关的其他部门没有取得很好的合作，如对外贸易部、商业部……等没有对高等教育和科学研究工作给以供应仪器设备的方便之类；（四）负责高等教育的机关对科学研究工作与教育工作的看法，摇摆不定。以前是只重教学，把教授的工作看成只是教书，从提出科学进军后，又似乎有点重视所谓研究的人而轻视“教书匠”。现在听说更要把研究重心放在高等学校了，原因是苏联也在改。我不是反对改，而是希望最好是一切都仔细考虑后才改，不要只是因为苏联在改我们亦改。
    我觉得这些问题的产生并不始于今天，反映也不是第一次，其所以未能解决，主要原因是大家各顾自己所管部门的便利，不从整体利益出发所致，例如图书仪器供应，如何才办得好，必须各部门高级负责人才能解决，有些甚至不是一部门单独可以解决的。所以需要若干部门共同来协调才行。
    最后我想利用这个机会向大家介绍一下国家计量局的工作；因为“计量”一词不为许多人所习见，所以对我们这个局的了解不够。我曾接到一封信，封面上写成
  “计粮局”；即令在工厂里也还有不一致的解释，例如鞍山钢铁公司的计量车间只管衡器，他们是把“量”字作数量的意思解释的。“计量”即英文的meterology。计量局是一个科学机关。它的主要工作是保证工业上和科学研究上所使用的量具计器的一致和准确并正确使用。它的工作与苏联的部长会议所属的标准、量具与计器委员会、美国的国家标准局和英国的国家物理实验室所作的科学工作部分相同。因此它是我国工业建设上和科学研究上以及贸易上所迫切需要的。但是我局成立了将近两年，还没有能力为工业和科学服务。主要原因是我们这个工作还没有受到各方面应有的重视。有人说它十分重要，有人又说在中国搞这工作还不够条件，见仁见智，各有不同。到目前，我们还没有得到应有的科学家和工程师来工作；应有的基本建设费用亦还未得到。希望大家支持我们。我敢大胆说一句，只要把计量工作做好，今天工业上和对内对外贸易上由于缺乏精确的量具计器的标准而造成的损失会大大减少。
    我上面反映的都是事实。但我的看法是否正确，尚希大家讨论和指教。
