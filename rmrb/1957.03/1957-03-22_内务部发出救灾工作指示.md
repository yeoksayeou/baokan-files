Xinhua News Agency, March 20th - The Ministry of Internal Affairs issued "Instructions on Several Issues in the Current Disaster Relief Work" on March 19th, requiring disaster areas to strengthen disaster relief efforts, prevent the development of spring famine, and support farmers in disaster areas to strive for a bumper harvest this year.

The instructions stated: All disaster areas should immediately conduct a comprehensive inspection, thoroughly understanding the current situation of the disaster, village by village, commune by commune, and household by household, and find ways from all aspects for the victims to overcome the spring famine. The grain shortage problem should be clarified as to whether it is genuine or not, and the potential of grain within the commune should be investigated and properly resolved separately. Regarding production issues, the unified arrangement of agriculture and sideline occupations should be strengthened, and efforts should be made to solve the shortage of raw materials and the difficulty of sales for sideline production; mobilize disaster victims to plant more early-maturing crops; organize disaster victims to engage in possible transportation, water conservancy and other construction projects, and find ways for disaster victims to make a living locally. If there are problems with the relief work, the distribution of relief funds must be done effectively, ensuring that those who need relief can receive the necessary relief in a timely manner.

The instructions also required all disaster areas to strengthen the political and ideological education of disaster victims, calling on farmers in disaster areas to invest in the current spring ploughing and production, and strive for a bumper harvest this year, so that they can see the bright future of agricultural production and settle down in agricultural production; dissuade them from blindly flowing into cities. All disaster areas must also strengthen the education of disaster victims on frugality and surviving the famine, and correct the extremely inappropriate phenomena of eating and drinking extravagantly and wasting money.

The instructions finally stated: The state has invested a considerable amount of relief funds in disaster areas this year, and as long as the relief work is done well, it will be sufficient. All disaster areas must earnestly implement the principle of special funds for special purposes and strengthen the management of relief funds, preventing waste, cadres occupying more than their share, corruption, and average distribution.

　　内务部发出救灾工作指示
    新华社20日讯　内务部在3月19日发出“关于目前救灾工作中几个问题的指示”，要求灾区加强救灾工作，防止春荒发展，支援灾区农民争取今年的大丰收。
    指示说：各灾区目前应当立即进行一次普遍检查，挨乡、挨社、挨户认真了解一次灾情现况，并且从各方面为灾民渡过春荒而想办法。缺粮问题应分清真假并清查社内粮食潜力，分别加以妥善解决。生产问题应加强农、副业的统一安排，设法解决副业生产的原料不足和销路困难；发动灾民多种早熟作物；组织灾民从事可能进行的交通、水利等建设工程，为灾民就地寻找谋生的门路。如救济工作上有问题，就须切实做好救济款的发放工作，务使必须救济的都能及时得到必要的救济。
    指示还要求各灾区加强对灾民的政治思想教育工作，号召灾区农民投入当前的春耕生产，争取今年大丰收，使他们看清农业生产的光明远景，安心于农业生产；劝阻他们不要盲目流入城市。各灾区还须加强对灾民的节约渡荒教育，纠正极不应有的大吃大喝、铺张浪费现象。
    指示最后说：今年国家投入灾区的救济款为数不少，只要做好救济工作，是可以够用的。各灾区须认真贯彻专款专用原则和加强对救济款的管理，防止浪费、干部多占、贪污和平均发放的现象发生。
