    "Competition"
    (A True Story)
    Soviet Union, F. Sharikov
    One evening, an American unemployed worker, Ned Brest, finally arrived in Long Beach. He was attracted by an enticing advertisement that read: "Endurance competition to be held. Winner gets ten U.S. dollars."
    Ten U.S. dollars! That was a worker's weekly wage!
    Many people wanted to participate in this competition. They were all hungry, suffering unemployed people. The business owner, Todd Faulkner, selected eighteen men and four women from them, and told them to walk around in circles on the stage until they were exhausted, at which point they were allowed to leave the stage. Todd Faulkner rubbed his hands smugly, charging each audience member twenty-five cents. The total income was quite considerable. The competition began, and these tired people started walking on the stage. Todd Faulkner kept shouting: "Come on, boys, put some pep in it!" Hour after hour passed, and the participants gradually couldn't hold on any longer. Finally, only two people were left on the stage: a short man wearing a felt cap, and Ned Brest. At this point, a gambling atmosphere enveloped the entire audience. Many people were betting on the two of them, seeing who had the most endurance. Later, the short man wobbled and fell down. Then Todd Faulkner announced: "The prize is awarded to Ned Brest."
    Just then, an elderly gentleman ran onto the stage. He bent down and shouted at the short man lying motionless on the stage: "You bastard, I bet a thousand dollars on you!"
    The short man didn't answer, because he was already dead...

    “比赛”
    （真实的故事）
    苏联　弗·沙里可夫
    一个美国失业工人涅得·布列斯特在一个傍晚好不容易地来到了龙戈比奇。他是被一张诱人的广告吸引来的。广告上写的是：“举行耐力比赛。得胜者可得十元美金。”
    十元美金！要知道，这是一个工人一星期的工资啊！
    想参加这次比赛的人很多。这都是些饥饿、受苦的失业者。企业主陶德·弗克涅尔从中挑选了十八名男人和四名女人，叫他们在舞台上绕圈，一直绕到筋疲力竭时才准他们走下舞台。陶德·弗克涅尔洋洋自得地搓着手，向每一个观众索取了二十五分钱。总收入是相当可观的。比赛开始了，这些疲惫的人开始在舞台上走了起来。陶德·弗克涅尔不断地喊着：“小伙子们，加点劲儿！”一小时一小时地过去了，参加比赛的人逐渐地支持不住了。最后，舞台上只剩下了两个人：一个是戴着毡便帽的矮个子，另一个就是涅得·布列斯特。这时赌博气氛笼罩了所有的观众。许多人都拿他们俩打赌，看他们俩谁的耐力最强。后来，矮个子摇晃了一下就倒下了。接着陶德·弗克涅尔宣布说：“奖金授给涅得·布列斯特。”
    正在这时候，一位上了年纪的先生跑到舞台上来了。他弯下腰对着一动也不动地躺在台上的矮个子喊道：“混蛋，我在你身上赌了一千美元啊！”
    矮个子什么也没回答，因为他已经死了……
