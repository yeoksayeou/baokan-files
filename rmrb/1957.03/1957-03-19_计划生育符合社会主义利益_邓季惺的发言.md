    Planned Births Comply with Socialist Interests
    Speech by Deng Jixing
    The Annual Increase in China's Population is Very Large
    I would like to discuss the issue of China's socialist construction and population control here. The superiority of the socialist system has been fully demonstrated in the rapid population growth in our country in recent years. In old China, poverty and backward medical and health work affected population growth. It is said that during the Kuomintang rule, the annual birth rate was 35‰, and the mortality rate was 25‰. Under such circumstances of high birth and high death rates, the natural growth rate was only about 10‰. If we add imperialist aggression and slaughter, the sacrifices of civil wars, and the prevalence of natural and man-made disasters, the mortality rate of life would be even more alarming. Therefore, the population increase at that time was not very significant. For a long time, there was an unreliable figure of 475 million. It was not until the population census in June 1953 that it was discovered that the total population of our country had far exceeded this number. Since liberation, people's lives have become more stable, their material and cultural levels have been continuously improved, and the Party and the government have cared for people's health, and medical and health work has developed rapidly. (The promotion of the new midwifery method alone reduces the death of about five million babies every year.) All these advances are reflected in population changes. According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs in 1953, the annual birth rate in our country was 37‰, the mortality rate was 17‰, and the natural growth rate was 20‰. (Some estimates are as high as 25‰. Taking Beijing as an example: the birth rate in 1955 was 43.2‰, and in 1956 it was 40.2‰; the mortality rate in 1955 was 8.1‰, and in 1956 it was 7.8‰; the growth rate in 1955 was 35.1‰, and in 1956 it was 32.4‰.) This means that the birth rate has increased compared with before liberation, while the mortality rate has been greatly reduced, so the natural growth rate is more than ten per thousand higher than before liberation. For China, with a population of 600 million, an annual population increase of more than 20‰ is not a small number. If calculated at 25‰, it will increase by more than 15 million people every year. This is equivalent to the population of a medium-sized European country.
    Excessive Population Brings Difficulties to National Construction and Improvement of People's Lives
    Prosperity of the population and the prosperity of the nation are originally gratifying phenomena. However, our country's economy is still very backward, and the level of productivity is not high. At this time, excessive population growth brings difficulties to accelerating socialist industrialization and improving people's lives more quickly. In order to maximize the satisfaction of the people's growing material and cultural needs, production in socialist countries must develop continuously in a planned and proportional manner on a highly technical basis. Our country's first five-year plan is about to be completed victoriously and ahead of schedule. The second five-year plan is being prepared. If the population figures we rely on are inaccurate, then the plans and proportions set will be divorced from reality, and imbalances will inevitably cause confusion in implementation. It can be said that planning the national economy in isolation without planning births or controlling the population does not meet the requirements of socialist economic laws. Because the population grows without limit, the accumulation rate in the national income is difficult to expand, which directly affects the amount of investment in capital construction, and the level of technical equipment cannot be improved quickly. In this way, both productivity and the scope of employment are limited. When population resources exceed needs, and the consuming population continues to increase, the needs in all aspects of clothing, food, housing, transportation, education, culture, medical care, and health cannot be fully met. Currently, neither the state can cover it all, nor can families afford it, which inevitably creates tension. Taking primary school education alone: ​​whether we go to streets and alleys, cities or villages, we see groups of children everywhere. The children born in the early days of liberation should all be in primary school this year. Tens of millions of school-age children do not have more schools to accommodate them, which is a very difficult problem to arrange! Furthermore, parents with many children, especially mothers, bear an excessively heavy mental and material burden. They cannot provide adequate care and reasonable upbringing for their children, which affects the healthy growth of the next generation, which is so serious. To treat the issue of childbirth fatalistically runs counter to the aspirations for national prosperity, national excellence, and family happiness. I believe that not only during the transition period, but also after the completion of socialist society, the population cannot be allowed to increase without limit. Since 1950, the annual population growth rate in the Soviet Union has been around 17‰. (Birth rate 26‰, mortality rate around 9‰) The annual population growth rate in other European socialist countries such as Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia has not exceeded 15‰. The Soviet Union has a vast territory and a sparse population, and the production levels of the above-mentioned brotherly countries are higher than those of our country. According to this standard: according to the conditions in our country, the population birth rate should be greatly reduced, and the growth rate should be controlled below 10‰ to be reasonable.
    The Party and the government have also long paid attention to the issue of regulating the population. Chairman Mao has clearly instructed on the Supreme State Council. Premier Zhou said in the "Proposal on the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy": "In order to protect women and children, educate the next generation well, and benefit the health and prosperity of the nation, we approve of appropriate restraint in childbearing." The problem now is how to take active and effective measures. I would like to put forward the following suggestions for reference by the government and all parties when studying this issue.
    Five Suggestions for Controlling Population
    1. It is suggested that another population census be conducted during next year's general election. Revise the population figures, find out the law of population change in the past five years, and use it as a reliable basis for determining population policy and implementing the second five-year plan in the future.
    2. Improve the household registration management system, grasp population figures and changes, conduct analysis and statistics, and provide reference to relevant parties such as national economic planning departments, various business departments, and population problem research institutions. Although the national household registration and statistics work was transferred to the unified management of the public security department in the spring of 1956, the statistics are not timely enough, the figures are not very accurate, and the analysis and research work has hardly started. We should pay attention to it in the future and improve it.
    3. Advocate late marriage, oppose early marriage, and appropriately raise the minimum age for marriage. Currently, marriage registration authorities follow the central interpretation that "age can be calculated according to nominal age" when calculating marriage age. As a result, many girls who are only sixteen years old have also registered for marriage. Early marriage is a bad habit that is harmful to young people's health, studies, and work. Extensive and in-depth publicity and education should be carried out to change the trend of early marriage. Judging from the statistics of marriage registration in Beijing, the number of parties who are not old enough to apply for registration has decreased year by year in recent years, and in 1956 it was less than five per thousand of the total number of applications. It can be seen that people's concept of abiding by the law has gradually been strengthened. If the minimum marriage age in the Marriage Law can be slightly raised (changed to 22 years old for men and 20 years old for women) or changed to be calculated according to real age, it will be beneficial to reducing the birth rate and encouraging young people to concentrate on studying and working hard.
    4. Except for ethnic minority areas, universally publicize the principles and methods of birth control, especially to the vast rural areas, so that every household knows and both men and women are aware of it, and especially pay attention to enlightening men to be conscious and self-disciplined. The health department is responsible for guiding and supplying medicines, and further research on effective and easy-to-implement methods. (After Beijing promoted birth control, it has received considerable results. The birth rate has dropped from 43.2‰ in 1955 to 40.2‰ in 1956, and the decline in urban areas is even more pronounced than in suburban areas: in 1956, the birth rate in urban areas was 39.3‰, and in suburban areas it was 41.3‰.)
    5. Relax the conditions for performing sterilization surgery. The conditions stipulated by the Ministry of Health are somewhat excessive and strict. I believe that as long as there are three children and both husband and wife agree, it can be allowed. According to medical science and practical examples, both male vasectomy and female tubal ligation have no impact on health and sexual life. However, male surgery is simpler than female surgery, so it should be introduced and promoted. Doctor Wang Ligeng, a member of this association, has personally performed more than 100 cases, and the results are all good. Beijing Tongren Hospital has opened a vasectomy clinic, and hospitals in other places should also follow suit.
    As for "induced abortion," abortion must never be regarded as one of the birth control methods and equated with "sterilization" surgery. "Sterilization" is a lasting restriction on childbearing. "Induced abortion" is to terminate the pregnancy after the fetus has been formed by surgery or medication, killing the life of the fetus. This method is very harmful to the mother's body and cannot achieve the purpose of birth control. In his speech the other day, Committee Member Li Jiansheng pointed out the adverse consequences caused by relaxing the restrictions on induced abortion based on the situation in various hospitals in Beijing. In 1956, more than 130,000 babies were born in Beijing, and induced abortion paid such a high price and wasted so much manpower and material resources, but only 1,593 fetuses were aborted. Repeated abortion and repeated pregnancy affect the reduction of the birth rate and bring many diseases to the mother of the fetus. Furthermore, the fetus is already a new life and a future little citizen, and his "right to life" should be protected by law. This kind of abuse of abortion surgery is only fifty steps away from "infanticide," and both should not be allowed by humanity. "The criminal laws of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Albania, Mongolia, and many other countries have provisions for the punishment of 'abortion' (except to save the mother's life)." In order to protect women's health and fetal life, "induced abortion" should be strictly controlled. Except for cases where the mother is ill, it should not be performed lightly.
    The above are my personal opinions, and please correct me if there is anything inappropriate.

### 计划生育符合社会主义利益  邓季惺的发言

    计划生育符合社会主义利益
    邓季惺的发言
    我国每年增加的人口数字很大
    我想在这里谈谈我国社会主义建设与人口控制问题。社会主义制度的优越性，在我国近年来人口迅速增长这一情况上已经充分地显示出来。在旧中国由于人民穷困、医药卫生工作落后，影响人口的增长。据说：国民党统治时期每年出生率为35‰，死亡率为25‰，在这样生得多、死得也多的情况下，自然增长率不过10‰左右。如果再加上帝国主义侵略屠杀、内战牺牲和天灾人祸流行，生命的死亡率更会大得惊人。因此，那时人口增加不十分显著。长时期说着一个不可靠的数字四亿七千五百万。直到1953年6月进行了人口普查，才发现我国人口总数已经远远超过了这个数目。解放以来，人民生活日趋安定，物质、文化水平不断提高，党和政府关怀人民健康，医药卫生工作迅速发展。（仅推广新法接生一项工作，每年就少死亡五百万左右的婴儿）所有这些进步，都在人口变动现象上反映出来。据内务部1953年统计：我国人口每年出生率为37‰，死亡率17‰，自然增长率为20‰。（也有估计为25‰的。以北京市为例：出生率55年43.2‰，56年40.2‰；死亡率55年8.1‰、56年7.8‰；增长率55年35.1‰、56年32.4‰。）这就是说：出生率比解放前提高了，死亡率则大大地降低了，因而自然增长率就比解放前提高了千分之十几。六亿人口的我国，每年增加20‰以上的人口，这不是一个小数字，如按25‰计算，每年要递增一千五百万人以上。这抵得上欧洲一个中型国家的人口了。
    人口过多给国家建设和改善人民生活带来了困难
    人丁繁荣、民族兴旺，本来是可喜的现象。但是，我国目前经济还很落后，生产力水平不高，这时候人口增加过多，给加速社会主义工业化和更快地改善人民生活都带来了困难。社会主义国家为了最大限度地满足人民日益增长的物质文化要求，生产必须在高度技术基础上，有计划按比例地不断发展。我国第一个五年计划就要胜利地超额完成了。第二个五年计划正在编制中。如果我们所依据的人口数字是不精确的，那末，所定出来的计划和比例就会与实际脱节，必然会因失去平衡而在执行中造成混乱。可以这样说：孤立地计划国民经济而不计划生育，不控制人口，是不符合社会主义经济规律的要求的。因为人口漫无限制地增长，国民收入中的积累率就难于扩大，直接影响基本建设投资数额，技术装备就不能很快地提高了。这样，既限制着生产力，也限制着就业面。人口资源超过了需要，消费人口不断增加，衣、食、住、行、教育文化、医药卫生等各方面的需要都不能充分满足。目前国家既包不下来，家庭也负担不了，就不免形成紧张。单就小学教育来说：我们无论走到大街小巷、城市农村，到处都看见成群结队的儿童。解放初期出生的孩子们今年都该上小学了。数以千万计的及龄儿童没有更多的学校可以容纳，这是多么难于安排的问题啊！再说多子女的父母们，特别是这些母亲们，精神上物质上的负担都过于沉重了。他们无法对孩子进行周到的照顾，合理的教养，这影响下一代的健全成长，又是多么严重。听天由命地对待生育问题，对国家富强、民族优秀、家庭幸福的愿望，都是背道而驰的。我认为不仅在过渡时期，就是在社会主义社会建成以后，人口也不能听其无限制地增加。苏联自1950年以来，每年人口增长率一直在17‰左右。（出生率26‰，死亡率9‰左右）其他欧洲几个社会主义国家如罗马尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫等，每年人口增长率都没有超过15‰的。苏联地广人稀，上述几个兄弟国家生产水平都比我国高。照这个标准来说：按我国的条件人口出生率应该大大地降低，增长率控制在10‰以下才是合理的。
    党和政府对调节人口的问题也早注意到了。毛主席在最高国务会议上已明确指示。周总理在“关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议”的报告中说：“为了保护妇女和儿童，很好地教养后代，以利民族的健康的繁荣，我们赞成在生育方面加以适当的节制。”现在的问题在于如何采取积极有效的措施。我谨提出以下几点意见，供政府和各方面研究此问题时参考。
    控制人口的五点建议
    1、建议明年普选时再作一次人口普查。订正人口数字，找出五年来人口变化的规律，作为今后确定人口政策和执行第二个五年计划的可靠依据。
    2、健全户籍管理制度，掌握人口数字和变化情况，进行分析统计，提供国民经济计划部门、各业务主管部门和人口问题研究机构等有关方面参考。56年春，全国户口登记、统计工作虽已划归公安部门统一管理，但统计还不够及时，数字也不十分精确，分析研究工作几乎还没有着手。今后应该重视起来，加以改进。
    3、提倡晚婚，反对早婚，适当提高结婚最低年龄。目前婚姻登记机关计算婚龄时，遵照中央解释“可以按虚岁计算”。于是许多只有十六周岁的女孩子也登记结了婚。早婚是一种恶习，对于青年的健康、学业和工作都有害。应当广泛深入地进行宣传教育，转移早婚的风气。从北京市结婚登记的统计来看，近年不够婚龄的当事人申请登记的已逐年减少，56年还不到申请总人数的千分之五。可见人民的守法观念业已逐步加强。如能将婚姻法最低结婚年龄略予提高，（改为男二十二岁、女二十岁）或改为按周岁计算，对于降低出生率和鼓舞青年专心学习努力工作都是有益的。
    4、除少数民族地区外，普遍宣传节制生育的道理和方法，特别要面向广大的农村，做到家喻户晓、男女咸知，尤其要注意启发男人自觉自制。卫生部门负责指导并供应药物，进一步研究有效易行的方法。（北京市宣传节育后，已收到相当效果，出生率由55年的43.2‰，降到56年的40.2‰，城区较郊区下降尤多：1956年出生率城区39.3％，郊区41.3％。）
    5、放宽施行绝育手术的条件。卫生部所规定的条件未免过多过严。我认为只要有了三个孩子，夫妇双方同意的，就可以允许施行。根据医学科学和实践事例证明，不论男性结扎输精管或女性结扎输卵管都对身体健康及两性生活毫无影响。惟男性施行手术较女性而简便，宜予介绍推行。本会委员王历畊大夫即已亲手作过一百例以上，后果都好。北京市同仁医院已开设扎输精管门诊，各地医院亦应仿行。
    至于“人工流产”堕胎绝不能作为节育方法之一而与“绝育”手术相提并论。“绝育”是持久性的节制生育。“人工流产”则系在胎孕已成之后，用手术或药物打胎，扼杀胎儿生命。这种办法对于母体危害性很大，又不能达到节育的目的。日前李健生委员发言已就北京市各医院的情况指出放宽人工流产限制后所引起的不良后果。56年北京市共出生了十三万多个婴儿，而人工流产付出那样大的代价浪费那样多的人力、物力，不过打掉一千五百九十三个胎儿。旋堕胎、旋怀孕，对于降低出生率的影响并且给胎儿的母亲带来许多病患。再说胎儿已是一个新的生命、是未来的小公民，他的“生之权利”应受到法律保护。这样滥施堕胎手术的行为和“溺婴”比较，不过五十步与百步之差，均应为人道所不许。“苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、阿尔巴尼亚、蒙古人民共和国及其他许多国家的刑法，对于‘堕胎’（为挽救母亲生命者除外）都有处罚的规定。”为了保护妇女健康和胎儿生命应该严格控制“人工流产”。除了因母体患病外，不宜轻予施行。
    以上是我个人的意见，如有不当之处，请予指正。
