One day in February, I arrived by boat in the emerging industrial city of Huangshi, Hubei Province. After disembarking, I saw a grey building situated at an intersection. This building was the Huangshi State-owned Commercial Comprehensive Building. I entered the comprehensive building to take a look. On the right and in front of the building, various daily-use consumer goods were displayed. On the left were food, cigarettes, alcohol, and hardware. On the second floor, there were various clothing items, fabrics, and stationery. Operating in this building were seven specialized companies of Huangshi City State-owned Commerce: Department Store, Cotton Yarn and Fabrics, Trade (operating retail of non-staple foods), Cultural Supplies, Monopoly, Hardware, and Transportation.

Besides this comprehensive building, Huangshi City also has twenty-five comprehensive stores led by the Trade Company. They are located near factories and mines such as Daye Steel Plant, Yuanlihua Coal Mine, Huaxin Cement Plant, Daye Power Plant, and Daye Iron Mine. In addition to handling the goods of their own company (food, groceries), these small comprehensive stores also carry two to three thousand kinds of goods, including daily-use consumer goods, fabrics, cigarettes and alcohol, pots and pans, paper and ink, oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar. These goods fall under the business scope of more than a dozen specialized companies. They are responsible for the entire supply of daily necessities in the industrial and mining areas, except for grain, fresh meat, vegetables, and coal for burning.

Establishing these comprehensive stores in industrial and mining areas has many benefits.

Take the Huangshi City State-owned Commercial Comprehensive Building as an example. This is a building with two floors on the sides and three floors in the front, covering an area of more than 1,840 square meters. If the seven specialized companies operating here were to each build a separate storefront, with each storefront calculated at 400 square meters, it would require building an additional 1,000 square meters and cost an extra 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. As for the areas near various factories and mines, because the Trade Company has established comprehensive stores, the other dozen or so specialized companies no longer need to set up separate storefronts, so just imagine how much construction funding this saves!

The establishment of comprehensive stores also saves manpower. The Trade Company's comprehensive store located at the entrance of the Daye Steel Plant has only twenty-four employees, yet it handles the goods of more than a dozen specialized companies. If each specialized company were to set up its own storefront, it would require at least forty people.

In the past, near the factories and mines here, there were only consumer cooperatives selling non-staple foods and a very small amount of daily-use consumer goods. Workers often had to travel several miles to buy an envelope, a rice bowl, or a light bulb; workers living in the Daye Steel Plant workers' village even had to travel more than ten miles. Now, with comprehensive stores, they can go in and buy everything they need for daily life all at once. In the Trade Company's comprehensive store at the entrance of the Daye Steel Plant, workers can buy nearly three thousand kinds of daily-use goods. Many workers and their family members say: Now it's much more convenient! We can go in through this door and come out through that door, and buy everything we need without wasting any time! With the improvement of business methods and service attitudes, these comprehensive stores are becoming increasingly loved by the broad masses of workers.

    职工们喜爱综合商店
    张碨
    2月里的一天，我乘轮船到了新兴的工业城市——湖北省黄石市。下船以后，就看见一座座落在十字路口的灰色楼房。这座楼房是黄石市国营商业综合大楼。我便进入综合大楼参观。只见右边和门前陈列着各种日用百货，左边摆有食品、烟酒和五金器械，二楼上还有各种服装、布匹、文具等商品。在这座大楼里营业的有黄石市国营百货、花纱布、贸易（经营副食品零售）、文化用品、专卖、五金、交通等七个专业公司。
    除这座综合大楼以外，黄石市还有二十五个由贸易公司领导的综合商店。它们分布在大冶钢厂、源利华煤矿、华新水泥厂、大冶发电厂、大冶铁矿等厂矿的附近。这些小型的综合商店除了经营本公司的商品（食品、杂货）以外，还经营日用百货、布匹、烟酒、锅碗瓢盆、纸张笔墨、油盐酱醋等二、三千种货物，这些货物分属于十多个专业公司的经营范围。它们担负了工矿区除粮食、鲜肉、蔬菜、烧煤以外的全部生活供应工作。
    在工矿区建立这种综合商店，有许多好处。
    以黄石市国营商业综合大楼为例。这是一座旁边两层、正面三层的楼房，面积一千八百四十多平方公尺。如果在这里营业的七个专业公司都各自修建一个门市部，每个门市部按楼房四百平方公尺计算，就得多建造一千平方公尺，多花四、五万元。至于各个厂矿附近，因为贸易公司设立了综合门市部，其他十多个专业公司都不再单设门市部，这样节约的建设资金数字该有多大呀！
    综合商店的设立还节省了人力。贸易公司设在大冶钢厂大门口的综合商店，只有二十四个人，经营了十多个专业公司的商品；如果各专业公司单独设立门市部，起码就得四十个人。
    过去，这里各厂矿附近只有经营副食品和极少量日用百货的消费合作社，职工们往往为了买一个信封、一个饭碗，或者一个电灯泡，就跑好几里地；住在大冶钢厂工人村的职工，还得跑十多里地。现在有了综合商店，他们可以进去一下子就买到日常生活上需要的一切东西。在大冶钢厂大门口的贸易公司综合商店里，职工们可以买到近三千种日用商品。许多职工和职工家属说：现在可方便多了，从这个门进，从那个门出来，就能买齐所有东西，一点也不误事！随着经营方法、服务态度的改进，这些综合商店正在越来越受到广大职工的爱戴。
