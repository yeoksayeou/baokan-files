Xinhua News Agency, New York, 5th: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the 4th to continue discussing the issue of Israeli withdrawal.

Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir announced at the meeting that the Israeli Chief of Staff had, on the instructions of the government, held talks with the Commander of the United Nations Emergency Force. Complete agreement had been reached on the technical details concerning the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba, and their takeover by the United Nations forces.

British representative Noble then spoke, expressing satisfaction with Meir's statement.

Noble said that the British government considers the Straits of Tiran, leading to the Gulf of Aqaba, an international waterway, and that the British government is prepared to work with other countries to ensure that this right is universally recognized. The UK also believes that the responsibility for administering the Gaza Strip and the west coast of the Gulf of Aqaba should be borne by the UN forces stationed there. The Gaza Strip should be subject to some form of "international management and control."

Representatives from Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, New Zealand, and Australia also stated in their speeches that the Straits of Tiran are an international waterway and that ships of all countries can "freely navigate" there.

Iraqi representative Jamali opposed the notion that the Straits of Tiran are an international waterway. He said that the Assembly must act in accordance with international law and valid international agreements. The issue of navigation in the Straits of Tiran legally pertains to Egypt.

Colombian representative Urrutia disagreed with the suggestion of UN administration of the Gaza Strip. He said that the Israeli withdrawal must be immediate and unconditional. The Egyptian-Israeli Armistice Agreement already stipulates that the Gaza Strip is administered by Egypt. For the UN to control the region is illegal.

Indian representative Lal reiterated India's view that the Straits of Tiran are territorial waters and agreed with the Colombian representative's opinion on the Gaza Strip. Lal suggested that the Assembly hold a meeting no later than the 7th to hear the Secretary-General's report on the withdrawal issue.

Ceylon representative Gunawardena believed that the United Nations General Assembly should continue to meet until all issues arising from Israel's presence outside the 1949 armistice line are resolved.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi said that no conditions could be attached to Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba. He said that the Assembly should promote the implementation of its resolution demanding the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli troops. Nothing said here or elsewhere can affect Egypt's rights.

Fawzi also requested the United Nations Secretariat and the United Nations Emergency Force to take all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of the atrocities and acts of sabotage committed by Israel in the Gaza and Aqaba regions before and during its withdrawal from Sinai.

Soviet representative Sobolev said that Israel is trying to link the withdrawal with the satisfaction of certain conditions, which is inconsistent with the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly. These conditions imply that the UN forces should be stationed on Egyptian territory indefinitely, and that Egypt should not be able to control the two key regions of the Gulf of Aqaba and the Gaza Strip. Satisfying these conditions would seriously violate the undeniable rights of Egypt and other Arab countries to their territorial waters in the Gulf of Aqaba and the Straits of Tiran.

Sobolev said: The US government is acting as an accomplice of the Israeli government, actually saying that the Gulf of Aqaba is an international waterway and even mentioning the measures it will take. This arbitrary action is an example of implementing a policy of strength.

Sobolev said: In order to force the Arab peoples to accept its own arbitrary attitude, the United States intends to keep the UN forces stationed on Egyptian territory and along the Gulf of Aqaba for a long time, thereby turning them into occupation troops. The United States is conducting consultations with Israel in Washington in an attempt to bypass the United Nations and realize its own plans for the Near East countries.

Sobolev emphasized that according to the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly, Israeli troops must immediately and unconditionally withdraw from Egyptian territory.

After that, all United Nations forces must also immediately withdraw from Egyptian territory. Any other resolution that makes UN forces permanently stationed on Egyptian territory cannot be considered legal. If Israel continues to adopt delaying tactics, the United Nations must take resolute measures to stop Israel from continuing its aggression.

The United Nations Secretariat finally announced that as soon as the Secretary-General receives notification that Israeli troops have completed their withdrawal from the Aqaba Gulf and Gaza regions, the Assembly will reconvene to discuss the Middle East issue.

    以外长在联大宣布已就撤军问题同联合国部队司令达成协议
    埃外长说以色列撤军不能附有条件
    苏代表抨击美国想把联合国部队变成占领军
    新华社5日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会4日举行全体会议，继续讨论以色列撤军问题。
    以色列外交部长梅厄夫人在会上宣布，以色列参谋长已经根据政府的指示，同联合国紧急部队司令举行了会谈。会谈已经在有关以色列部队撤出加沙地带和亚喀巴湾地区并由联合国部队接管的技术细节问题上达成了完全的协议。
    英国代表诺布耳接着发言，对梅厄夫人的发言表示满意。
    诺布耳说，英国政府认为通向亚喀巴湾的蒂朗海峡是一条国际水道，英国政府准备同其他国家一起保证这种权利得到普遍承认。英国同时认为，管理加沙地带和亚喀巴湾西海岸的责任应当由驻在那里的联合国部队来担负。加沙地带应该实行某种“国际管理和控制”。
    意大利、荷兰、比利时、新西兰和澳大利亚等国代表在发言中也说，蒂朗海峡是一条国际水道，所有国家的船只都可以在那里“自由通航”。
    伊拉克代表贾马利反对所谓蒂朗海峡是国际水道的说法。他说，大会必须根据国际法和有效的国际协定行事。在蒂朗海峡通航的问题在法律上是属于埃及的事情。
    哥伦比亚代表乌鲁蒂亚不同意由联合国管理加沙地带的建议。他说，以色列撤军必须是立即的和无条件的。以—埃停战协定已经规定加沙地带由埃及管理。要联合国控制这个地区是非法的。
    印度代表拉尔重申印度认为蒂朗海峡是领水的见解，并且同意哥伦比亚代表关于加沙地带的意见。拉尔建议大会最迟在7日举行会议，以便听取秘书长关于撤军问题的报告。
    锡兰代表古纳瓦地尼认为联合国大会应该继续举行会议，直到由于以色列驻在1949年停火线外而引起的一切问题得到解决时为止。
    埃及外交部长法齐说，以色列撤出加沙地带和亚喀巴湾不能附加什么条件。他说，大会应该促使实现它的要求以色列立即无条件撤军的决议。这里或其他地方的任何人所说的任何话都不能影响埃及的权利。
    法齐还要求联合国秘书处和联合国紧急部队采取一切必要的措施来预防在加沙和亚喀巴湾地区重演以色列在撤出西奈以前和撤退过程中所犯的暴行和破坏活动。
    苏联代表索波列夫说，以色列正在设法把撤退同满足一些条件联在一起，这是不符合联合国大会的决议的。这些条件意味着使联合国部队无限期地驻在埃及领土上，意味着使埃及不能控制亚喀巴湾和加沙地带这两个关键性地区。满足这些条件会严重地侵犯埃及和其他阿拉伯国家对它们在亚喀巴湾和蒂朗海峡的领海的无可怀疑的权利。
    索波列夫说：美国政府正在充当以色列政府的帮凶，竟然说亚喀巴湾是国际水道，并且还提到了它将要采取的措施。这种专横的行动是执行实力政策的一个例子。
    索波列夫说：为了要强迫阿拉伯各国人民接受美国自己的专横的态度，美国打算使联合国部队长期驻扎在埃及领土上和亚喀巴湾沿岸，从而使他们变成占领军。美国在华盛顿同以色列进行商谈，就是想越过联合国而实现它自己对于近东国家的计划。
    索波列夫强调指出：根据联合国大会的决议，以色列军队必须无条件地立即撤离埃及领土。
    在这以后，所有联合国部队也必须立即撤离埃及领土。使联合国军队永久驻在埃及领土的任何其他决议都不能认为是合法的。如果以色列继续采取拖延策略，联合国必须采取坚决措施以制止以色列继续进行侵略。
    联合国秘书处最后宣布，一俟秘书长接到以色列军队已自亚喀巴湾和加沙地区撤退完毕的通知，大会将再行举行会议讨论中东问题。
