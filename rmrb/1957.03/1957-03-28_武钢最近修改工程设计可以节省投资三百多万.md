Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 27th: Some of the engineering designs of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex have recently been revised. According to preliminary calculations, this can save more than 3 million yuan in investment compared to the original designs.

This design revision was carried out by designers from the Wuhan Branch of the Black Metallurgical Design Institute together with Soviet experts. The revised parts belong to more than ten projects of the iron-smelting workshop, auxiliary repair facilities, drainage works, industrial sites, and electricity, of both domestic and foreign designs. In the revised designs, domestically manufactured machinery and equipment are used to replace foreign equipment; the procurement of expensive foreign equipment is replaced with commonly used equipment worldwide; some steel structures are changed to reinforced concrete structures, and some reinforced concrete structures are changed to stone or brick structures. In addition, the process has been reasonably modified, the degree of mechanization and automation of non-major production equipment has been appropriately reduced, hygiene equipment with excessively high standards has been appropriately lowered, and the construction of certain factory areas and some machinery and equipment that are temporarily unnecessary has been postponed in phases. The modification does not affect the quality of the project or the construction progress.

The Wuhan Branch of the Black Metallurgical Design Institute will modify the construction drawings based on the revised design plan. In order to submit the construction drawings in a timely manner, they have decided to organize designers to be stationed at the construction site to modify the drawings while guiding the construction.

    武钢最近修改工程设计可以节省投资三百多万
    新华社武汉27日电　武汉钢铁联合企业的一些工程设计最近进行了一次修改，据初步计算，可以比原来的设计节省三百多万元的投资。
    这次修改设计，是由黑色冶金设计院武汉分院的设计人员同苏联专家们一起进行的。修改的部分属于国内、外设计的炼铁车间、辅助修理设施、排水工程、工业场地、电力等十多个工程。在经过修改的设计中，采用了国内能够制造的机械设备来代替国外设备，把订购国外高贵的设备改用世界通常采用的设备；把有的钢结构改成钢筋混凝土结构，一些钢筋混凝土结构改成石块砌或砖砌结构。此外，还合理修改工艺，适当降低非主要生产设备的机械化、自动化的程序，适当降低标准过高的卫生设备，分期缓建某些厂房面积和某些目前暂时可以不要的机械设备等。修改后并不影响工程质量和施工进度。
    黑色冶金设计院武汉分院将根据这次修改的设计方案，进行施工图纸的修改。为了及时提交施工图纸，他们决定组织设计人员驻在工地，一边修改图纸，一边指导施工。
