Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 11th -- According to the Indian Press Trust: Indian Minister Without Portfolio Menon said in Mumbai on the 9th that the Suez Canal would soon be open to navigation - even partially open, the "hope is quite high." But he warned: "Any bad tendencies now will take us further and further away from a solution."

In a speech devoted to diplomatic issues, Menon indicated that the possible "bad tendencies" he was referring to were the recent statements by Western countries, particularly the United States and Canada, concerning Egypt. Menon said that, in his view, any solution that "infringes on Egyptian sovereignty and self-esteem" will not work. However, if restraint is exercised, there is a wide range of possibilities and ample reason to hope that the canal can be opened to navigation soon.

    梅农警告西方国家说
    侵犯埃及主权的办法行不通
    据新华社新德里11日电　据印度报业托辣斯消息：印度不管部长梅农9日在孟买说，苏伊士运河不久就通航——即使是局部通航的“希望相当大”。但是他警告说：“现在任何不好的倾向都会使我们距离解决越来越远”。
    梅农在一篇专门谈外交问题的演说中表明，他所说的可能的“不好倾向”是指最近西方国家，特别是美国和加拿大发表的有关埃及的言论而言。梅农说，在他看来，凡是“侵犯埃及主权、自尊”的解决办法都是行不通的。但是，如果实行克制，就有广泛的可能性和充分的理由希望运河很快就可以通航了。
