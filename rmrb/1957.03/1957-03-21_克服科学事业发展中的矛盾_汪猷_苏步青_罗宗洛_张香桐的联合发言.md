Overcoming Contradictions in the Development of Science
　　Joint Speech by Wang You, Su Buqing, Luo Zongluo, and Zhang Xiangtong

We are natural science researchers, and we have personally experienced the rapid growth of scientific research in our country in recent years. This has been partially reflected by President Guo Moruo in his speech at the enlarged meeting of the 11th Supreme State Conference. However, in the great leap forward in science, many difficulties and problems have also constantly arisen. Some difficulties have been overcome at any time, and some problems have become more prominent with development. Several committee members have already talked about the contradictory problems in the development of science in their speeches at the conference and contributed valuable opinions. We would like to add some supplementary points in this regard.

　　Better Training of Young Scientists

    First, how to better train young scientists. In recent years, scientific research institutions have continuously expanded their research teams and absorbed thousands of newly graduated young university students. They are generally passionate about science, work actively, and have already made some achievements. However, we feel that their level of basic science and foreign languages ​​has generally seemed to be declining in the past two or three years. This is clearly reflected in the examination results of the Academy of Sciences' postgraduate enrollment last year. For example, among the candidates recommended by various universities to take the Mathematics Institute's entrance exam, very few had a total score of seventy-five points in the two mathematics exams, and some even scored zero; among those applying to the Organic Chemistry Institute, very few scored above forty in the main item, organic chemistry. The better scores in all the exam papers of the two institutes were still from cadres who had graduated from university longer and were currently employed. The exam questions were not difficult, and were mostly set by professors from various universities. More noteworthy is that the foreign language proficiency of newly graduated students is even worse than their basic science scores. They usually find it difficult to read a page of foreign language reference books even after spending three or four hours. It is understood that this is a more common phenomenon. For these reasons, research institutions have had to open foreign language tutoring classes and basic science tutoring classes to help young people improve their basic scientific knowledge and master research tools in recent years.

    Some say that this situation is caused by the fact that enrollment in the past few years only focused on quantity and did not guarantee quality. This may be one of the reasons. But are there no problems with university teaching methods? Are there any problems with teachers? Do the problems that exist in primary and secondary school teaching have no impact? For example, the foreign language teaching problem involves secondary schools. It is said that middle schools have begun to consider teaching Russian or English. We welcome this measure, and we hope that universities will also increase compulsory or elective courses in foreign languages ​​such as Russian, English, and German.

    At present, the basic science courses in various universities are rarely taught by professors with teaching and research experience. As far as we know, this situation exists in universities in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places. In the past few years, this practice had its reasons, but now that the university situation has basically changed, it should be reconsidered. In scientifically advanced countries, basic science courses are taught by experienced professors themselves. We hope that the responsible comrades of relevant departments will quickly and decisively let the professors get rid of all other work and return to the podium, so that they can have at least six-fourths of their time completely at their disposal to focus on teaching students and research.

    To better train young cadres, we must improve the teaching staff and allow more and better exchanges between senior and mid-level personnel in universities and research institutions. In the past, several institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and universities had some cooperation and achieved some successful experience. We hope that more research units and universities will have a more comprehensive exchange and cooperation, with universities sending more professors to research institutes to lead research, more lecturers to research institutes for further study, and research institutes also continuously sending senior and mid-level researchers to participate in teaching. From the perspective of research institutions, their expansion has certain limits. The university students currently assigned are not completely recruited according to their talents. Some cadres who have been trained for a long time but are not suitable for research work but have certain research experience and considerable scientific level should be sent to more suitable positions in a timely manner, such as certain teaching positions.

    In order to more quickly train new mid-level and senior-level cadres, our country has sent a large number of students studying abroad (including graduate students and interns) to study in foreign countries, and has hired foreign experts to lecture and work in our country. In this regard, considerable achievements have been made. This policy should continue to be implemented. However, many problems have arisen in the past implementation. For example, many students studying abroad were wrongly assigned to schools and were forced to change their majors. Among the students sent to the Soviet Union in 1955, there was a young chemist whose original unit planned to send him to the Soviet Union to study high-pressure organic chemical synthesis, but after waiting in Moscow for a year and a half, the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union asked him to change his major three times before he was assigned to Moscow University to study radiochemistry. This young man felt quite distressed. The original unit had opinions and questioned the Ministry of Higher Education. The Ministry of Higher Education said that it should ask the Student Management Office of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, while the latter politely pushed the responsibility to the Ministry of Higher Education. We can't help but ask: If everyone is not responsible, is it necessary for the students studying abroad to be responsible? There are quite a few similar examples. We ask the relevant departments to think about these young people from their perspective! We suggest that before sending students abroad, the sending unit and the presiding department must find out the details of the other school and research institution, and the Student Management Office and the Ministry of Higher Education must respect the plan of the original sending unit and listen to the opinions of relevant experts.

    The hiring of foreign experts and the dispatch of interns were partially done through technical cooperation. In the past, the Ministry of Foreign Trade was in charge. Some of the experts invited were not needed by the requesting units. Conversely, some of the candidates nominated by the units were not invited. As a result, the foreign experts who arrived also had quite a few opinions because they could not play a role, causing passivity and losses for both parties. Many of the interns selected were often rejected, supposedly because there were no such majors, but in fact those countries did have them, and they were also happy to accept them. We believe that inviting experts and sending interns is different from the import and export of goods, so why bother the Ministry of Foreign Trade? It should be handled by a more appropriate department.

　  Developing Scientific Research Institutions Based on the Principle of Overall Planning and Consideration

    Second, how to better develop scientific research institutions based on the policy of overall planning and consideration, streamlining and saving. With the progress of scientific undertakings, a large number of scientific research institutions have sprung up, which is inevitable, but it has also brought us some new contradictions: competing for cadres, rushing to buy books and instruments, and competing to build large buildings. We agree with the phenomenon of "putting on rival shows" in the establishment of research institutions currently proposed by Committee Member Ma Dayou. For example, the Ministry of Agriculture already had the Northwest Agricultural Research Institute in Wugong, Northwest, and the Northwest Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences also established the Agricultural Biology Research Institute; in Lanzhou, the Ministry of Agriculture already had the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Research Institute, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences also established the Veterinary Research Office. What is the reason for each doing its own thing? Especially since our country has a severe shortage of veterinary experts, each institute only has two experts.

    There is also a tendency to prematurely establish branches and new institutes. In the twelve-year scientific and technological vision plan, according to preliminary estimates, nearly nine hundred research institutions will be established in the second five-year plan. After discussion, some have been reduced, but according to the current situation, there is still an abnormal development and proliferation trend. For example, the Chinese Academy of Sciences established Guangzhou and Wuhan branches based on the opinions of the Guangdong and Hubei provincial governments. Due to the large scale of the plan and the difficulty of implementation, did they have the basic conditions prepared in advance? In the past year, the health department, industrial departments, etc. have also had similar situations. We believe that the establishment of new research institutions is necessary, but the objective and subjective conditions should be considered maturely.

    The above-mentioned opinions we have put forward may be one-sided or even wrong. Please correct them, members of the committee and relevant departments. (Attached picture)

　　克服科学事业发展中的矛盾
　　汪猷　苏步青　罗宗洛　张香桐的联合发言
    我们是自然科学研究工作者，我们亲身体会到这几年来我国科学研究事业的迅速成长，这方面已由郭沫若院长在第十一次最高国务会议扩大会议发言中部分地反映了。但是在大踏步地向科学进军中也不断地产生了不少困难和问题，有些困难是随时克服了，有些问题则随着发展而更形突出。好几位委员在大会发言中已经谈到了科学事业发展中的矛盾问题，并贡献了宝贵的意见，我们愿意再就这方面作些补充。
　  更好地培养青年科学家
    一、如何更好地培养青年科学家。最近几年各个科学研究机构不断地扩大了研究队伍，吸收了成千的刚毕业的年青大学生。他们一般都是热爱科学、工作积极、并已作出了一些成绩。但是我们感觉到他们的基础科学和外文的水平这二、三年来一般地似乎在下降。这明显地表现在去年应考科学院招收研究生的考试成绩中。例如由各大学保送投考数学研究所的考生中有二门数学考试总分达到七十五分的很少，甚至有得零分的；投考有机化学研究所的主要项目有机化学答题得四十分以上的也很少。二所全部考卷中成绩较好的还是大学毕业较久的在职干部。考试题目并不难，大都是由各大学的教授所出。更值得注意的是新毕业学生的外文程度比基础科学成绩更差。他们平常化三、四个小时还难阅读一页外文参考书，据了解这是较普遍的现象。因为这些缘故，近年来研究机构必须开外文补习班、基础学科补习班等来帮助青年们提高基础科学知识水平和掌握研究工具。
    有人说这种情况是由于前几年招生只顾到数量没有保证质量所造成。这可能是原因之一。但是大学教学方法上是不是没有问题？师资有没有问题？中小学的教学上所存在的问题就没有影响吗？譬如外文教学问题就牵连到中学。听说中学已开始考虑教授俄文或英文，我们欢迎这一措施，我们希望大学里也要增加俄文、英文、德文等外文的必修或选修课。
    目前各大学的基础学科课程很少由有教学、研究经验的教授亲自讲课的。就我们所知道的北京、上海、南京等地各大学就有这种情况。在前几年这种做法是有它的理由，而现在大学情况基本有所改变，就当重作考虑。在科学先进的国家，基础学科的课都由有经验的教授亲自来教。我们希望有关部门的负责同志赶快毅然决然地让教授们摆脱一切其他工作重登讲台，让他们至少要有六分之四的时间能够完全由他们自由支配放在教学生与研究上。
    要更好地培养青年干部得提高师资，让高等学校与研究机构的高中级人员更多更好地交流。过去中国科学院有几个研究所和大学已有了一些合作，取得一点成功经验。我们希望更多的研究单位和高等学校有一个比较全面的交流合作，大学放更多的教授去研究所领导研究，更多的讲师去研究所进修，而研究所也能不断轮派高级和中级研究人员去参加教学。从研究机构方面着想，它的扩张有一定的限度，目前能分配到的大学生并不是完全量材录用的，有些经过长期培养而不适合于研究工作、但已具一定研究经验和相当科学水平的干部宜及时送到更适合的岗位，例如某些教学岗位去。
    为了更迅速地培养出新的中、高级干部，我国曾派遣出大批留学生（包括研究生和实习生）到外国去学习，并聘请外国专家来我国讲学和工作。这方面已获得了相当的成绩。这种政策是应当继续执行的。但在以往执行中曾出现许多问题。例如不少留学生被错安排了学校，被迫改了专业。在1955年留苏的学生中有一位青年化学家，原单位计划派他去苏联学习高压有机化学合成的，但是在莫斯科等候了一年半，驻苏大使馆要他改了三次专业志愿，方被安插到莫斯科大学学习放射化学。这位青年颇感痛苦。原单位有意见向高等教育部责问，高教部说应该问驻苏大使馆留学生管理处，而后者又客气地将责任推向高等教育部。我们不禁要问：大家不负责，难道要留学生本人负责。相仿的例子相当的多。我们请有关部门要设身处地的为这些青年想一想！我们建议在派遣留学生之前，派遣单位和主持部门必须摸清对方学校、研究机构的底细，而留学生管理处与高等教育部必须尊重原派遣单位的计划，要倾听有关专家的意见。
    聘请外国专家和派遣实习生部分是通过技术合作方式的，过去是由对外贸易部主持，请来的专家有部分不是提请单位所需要的，反之，有些单位提名的并没有邀请到。因此到来的外国专家亦颇有意见，因为他们不能发挥作用，造成了双方被动和损失。选派的实习生有不少每每被拒绝接受，据说没有这些专业，而事实上那些国家是有的，并且他们也乐于接受。我们认为请专家和派实习生不同于商品的进出口，何必有劳对外贸易部，应该由更适当的部门来担任。
　  根据统筹兼顾原则发展科学研究机构
    二、如何更好地根据统筹兼顾、精简节约的政策来发展科学研究机构。随着科学事业的进展，科学研究机构大量兴起，这是必然的，但是也给我们带来了一些新的矛盾：争夺干部、抢购图书仪器，竞建大楼。我们同意马大猷委员所提出目前在研究机构设置方面存在唱对台戏的现象。例如在西北武功农业部原有西北农业研究所，中国科学院西北分院又设立了农业生物研究所；在兰州农业部原有畜牧兽医研究所，中国科学院也设立了兽医研究室。有什么理由各搞一套？尤其我国兽医专家奇缺，每所各只拥有二个专家。
    还有一种偏向是过早地设分院、设新所。在十二年科学技术远景规划中，据初步估计，在第二个五年计划内要设立近九百个研究机构，经过商讨有些削减了，但根据目前情况仍有不正常发展和繁生的倾向。例如中国科学院根据广东省及湖北省政府的意见设立广州及武汉分院，由于计划庞大，执行困难，它们事先都有了基本条件的准备吗？在过去一年中，卫生部门、工业部门等也有类似的情况发生。我们认为新的研究机构是必要建立的，但是应当成熟地考虑主客观的条件。
    以上我们所提出的意见可能是片面的、甚至有错的，请各位委员及有关部门指正。（附图片）
