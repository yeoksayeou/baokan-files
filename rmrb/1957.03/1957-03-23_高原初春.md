　　Early Spring on the Plateau

　　Spring has come to the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture on the plateau. As you travel along the Kang-Tibet Highway, you will see women threshing highland barley on the rooftops while singing melodious folk songs. In some places, manure is already being transported to the fields, and spring plowing has begun in the river valleys. Daofu, on the banks of the Fresh River, is one of the first counties in the autonomous prefecture to complete democratic reform. Agricultural cooperatives throughout the county are universally implementing seed selection, seed dressing with pesticides, and the promotion of new-style farm implements during spring plowing.
　　You can also see the herdsmen on the pastures. Riding their steeds, draped in sheepskin robes, with their bronze arms half-exposed, they loudly shout as they move among the herds of cattle under the sunlight. Before long, when the land is a sea of green, they will move to their summer tents – the summer pastures.
　　In the scattered villages, almost every house has a corner of its roof adorned with clusters of short "Dajue" (prayer flags), fluttering colorfully in the air, especially those prayer flags that were added during the recent Tibetan New Year, which are particularly bright and eye-catching. The white-walled, red-windowed lamaseries, built against the mountains, appear like multi-story buildings, and the sounds of bells and chanting resonate in the air around the temples. It is now the first month of the Tibetan calendar, and many temples are holding grand scripture assemblies.

　　高原初春
　　新华社记者　于竞祁
    春天来到了高原上的甘孜藏族自治州。沿着康藏公路走去，你会看到妇女们在屋顶上一边打着青稞，一边唱着悦耳的民歌。有的地方已开始向地里送粪，河谷地带已开始春耕。鲜水河两岸的道孚是自治州最早完成民主改革的县份之一，全县农业社在春耕中普遍地实行了选种、药剂拌种和推广新式农具。
    你还可以看到在牧场上的牧民们。他们骑着骏马斜披着羊皮长袍，半露着古铜色的臂膀，高声地吆喝着游动在阳光下的牛群。再过不久，当大地一片青绿的时候，他们就要转入夏帐房——夏季牧场去了。
    那星散的村落，几乎家家房顶的一角上都插着丛集的不高的“达就”（经旆），五颜六色地在空中飘荡，特别是那些在不久前的藏历新年添上的经旆，格外鲜艳夺目。依山建筑的白墙红窗的喇嘛寺，像多层的楼房一样出现在人们面前，钟声和诵经声飘荡在寺庙附近的空际。现在正是藏历的正月，许多寺庙都举行着盛大的经会。
