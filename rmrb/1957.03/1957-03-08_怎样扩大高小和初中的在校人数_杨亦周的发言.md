I completely agree with Chairman Zhou Enlai's "Report on Visits to Eleven Asian and European Countries" and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference."

Prior to the opening of this conference, at the enlarged Supreme State Conference, I heard Chairman Mao's important instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people. It clarified the distinction between contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and contradictions among the people, which improved my ideological understanding and made me feel very excited.

Now I would like to express some opinions on how to solve the learning problems of primary and secondary school students. Since liberation, with the surge of China's national economy and the improvement of people's lives, education has developed tremendously. In Tianjin, for example, the number of primary and secondary school students has increased year by year. At present, the city has 118,000 junior high school students, more than four times the number before liberation, and more than 370,000 primary school students, more than twice the number before liberation. The enrollment target for 1957 in the first five-year plan has been achieved ahead of schedule in 1956. In order to solve the learning problems of such an increasing number of students, in addition to building and expanding some schools, the main reason is the implementation of the two-shift system.

	Popularize the Two-Shift System

It is no longer a problem for individual cities, but a national issue to better solve the learning problems of primary and secondary school students. Every year, tens of millions of school-age children need to enroll, and millions of junior high school students need to continue their education. This is a problem that must be properly arranged in China's education, and this problem is becoming increasingly serious. I fully agree with the opinion put forward by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, that is, senior elementary school graduates who cannot continue their education should be given one or two years of amateur agricultural technical education in order to engage in agricultural labor; senior elementary and junior high school graduates in cities who cannot continue their education should be given one or two years of amateur technical education. This will not only solve the employment problem of senior elementary and junior high school graduates who cannot continue their education, but also be conducive to the development of China's industrial and agricultural production. What I am talking about now is how to expand the number of students in senior elementary and junior high schools and give more children the opportunity to learn. In order to solve this problem, I think that the widespread implementation of the two-shift system is a better way.

The two-shift system in primary and secondary schools is not without its shortcomings, and it brings certain difficulties to schools and parents. Since Tianjin implemented the two-shift system in the second half of 1956, many children have not been well organized and guided in extracurricular activities, and they do not know how to arrange their lives. As a result, they wander around the streets in groups, and some of them have been infected with some bad habits, playing and making noise, not observing discipline, and affecting traffic order. Some parents accused the school of lax management, and some people even questioned the two-shift system and thought it should be stopped. We cannot deny that the two-shift system has certain difficulties and shortcomings, but we cannot ignore its advantages because of these difficulties and shortcomings. We must see that the teaching work of schools that have implemented the two-shift system is basically normal, the academic performance of the vast majority of students is very good, and communist moral qualities have grown up in the majority of students. These achievements are the main ones, and the shortcomings that exist are secondary ones. As long as we face up to these shortcomings, they can be completely overcome. We can imagine that if the two-shift system is not implemented, two problems will inevitably occur: either the state will allocate a large amount of funds to build school buildings, or a large number of children will be allowed to lose the opportunity to learn. In Tianjin alone, if the two-shift system is not implemented, to enable all students to study at school, it is necessary to build 43 new middle schools and 140 elementary schools, which requires a national investment of 59.5 million yuan. If so many new schools are not built, 185,000 students will drop out of school. This is just the situation in Tianjin. If we look at it from a national perspective, the problem is even more serious. Building the school buildings needed by primary and secondary school students across the country will inevitably reduce capital construction investment, weaken the strength of economic construction, and affect the speed of socialist industrialization. Obviously, this is not a good thing. Now that we cannot allocate a large amount of funds to build and expand school buildings, and we cannot allow a large number of students to drop out of school, we can only widely promote the two-shift system in primary and secondary schools and run the two-shift system well. If this is not done, the enrollment problems of primary and secondary school students, as far as the current situation is concerned, are difficult to solve completely.

The two-shift system may not be able to completely solve the learning problems of middle and primary school students, but it can at least solve most of the problems. In Tianjin, the junior high school classes that implement the two-shift system account for about 86% of the total number of classes, and the elementary school classes that implement the two-shift system account for about 76% of the total number of classes. If all primary and secondary schools implement the two-shift system, they can enroll more than 100,000 more students. Although we do not know the situation of the two-shift system in other regions, because the two-shift system has just been promoted, it may not be widespread enough and there is still some potential. In my opinion, all regions that cannot fully accommodate primary and secondary school students should appropriately promote the two-shift system.

	Comprehensively Arrange Students' Extracurricular Activities

In order to overcome the shortcomings of the two-shift system, the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee has studied this issue and decided to take the following measures:

	(1) Actively and gradually establish family study groups in elementary school students above the third grade and junior high school students. The content of group activities is mainly review and homework, and diversified activities are organized according to the characteristics and interests of students' ages, such as listening to the radio, games, sports and cultural activities, and household labor. This family study group will be a major method to strengthen extracurricular and out-of-school guidance for students.

	(2) It is determined that the subdistrict offices of each district are responsible for organizing and guiding the extracurricular activities of two-shift students; and guiding residents' committees and workers' family committees to assist the activities of family study groups.

	(3) Schools implementing the two-shift system should set up full-time counselors to be in charge of organizing and guiding students' extracurricular and out-of-school activities, and maintain close contact with social cultural and sports activity institutions and subdistrict offices to facilitate mutual cooperation.

	(4) Organize and mobilize the forces of all sectors of society to support and cooperate with the extracurricular and out-of-school activities of two-shift students. For example, radio stations, cultural centers, cinemas, theaters, libraries, stadiums, public places, and various agencies and enterprises should provide assistance and support as much as possible.

	(5) Schools with conditions will try out the "two-two system" of two classes each in the morning and afternoon for lower-grade students to reduce the fatigue of children attending classes continuously for half a day.

In order to ensure the implementation of the above measures, the educational administrative departments at all levels are also responsible for strengthening the leadership of school education; under the leadership of the Municipal Education Bureau and the People's Committees of various districts, the Municipal and District Student Extracurricular Activities Guidance Committees are established to comprehensively guide and arrange students' extracurricular activities; study and formulate the working methods of full-time school counselors and part-time counselors of subdistrict offices and social cultural and sports institutions, establish a regular contact system, and cooperate closely in work. The Municipal People's Committee also emphasized that school teachers should firmly establish an educational ideology that is fully responsible for students, and requires teachers to correct the ideology of "only teaching, not guiding" and "only managing classwork, not managing extracurricular activities"; for students' parents, they are called upon to care about the growth of their children and strengthen ties with schools and subdistricts, and require parents to change the idea of completely pushing the responsibility of educating their children to the school. In this way, with the cooperation of schools, families and all sectors of society, some of the difficulties and shortcomings caused by the implementation of the two-shift system can certainly be gradually overcome.

We believe that the two-shift system is a better way to solve the learning problems of primary and secondary school students in the current and future long period, but because it has not been implemented for a long time, no relatively complete experience has been obtained. It is hoped that the Ministry of Education will attach importance to this system and vigorously promote it nationwide, and at the same time continuously summarize and exchange the advanced experiences of various places, so that the two-shift system will be more sound.

    怎样扩大高小和初中的在校人数
    杨亦周的发言
    我完全同意周恩来主席所作的“关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告”和陈叔通副主席所作的“中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告”。
    这次会议开幕以前，在扩大的最高国务会议上，听到了毛主席关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾问题的重要指示，明确了敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部矛盾的区别，提高了我的思想认识，使我感到非常兴奋。
    我现在就如何解决中小学生的学习问题，发表一点意见。解放以来，随着我国国民经济的高涨和人民生活的改善，教育事业有了巨大的发展。就天津市来说，中小学生的人数，年年有所增加，目前全市在校学生初中已有十一万八千人，比解放前增加了四倍以上，小学有三十七万多人，比解放前增加了两倍，已经提前在1956年实现了第一个五年计划中1957年的招生指标。解决这样日益增加的学生的学习问题，除了新建和扩建了一部分学校外，主要是由于实行了二部制教学的结果。
      普遍推行二部制
    更好地解决中小学生的学习问题，已经不是个别城市的问题，而是全国性的问题，每年以千万计的适龄儿童需要入学，以百万计的初中学生需要升学，这是我国教育事业中必须加以适当安排的问题，而且这个问题是越来越加严重。我完全同意李富春副总理所提出的意见，就是高小毕业生不能升学的给以一年或两年的业余农业技术教育，以便从事于农业劳动；在城市的高小、初中毕业生不能升学的给以一年或两年的业余技术教育。这样不但能够解决不能升学的高小、初中毕业生的就业问题，而且有利于我国工农业生产的发展。我现在所谈的是如何扩大高小和初中在校人数，给予更多的儿童以学习机会的问题。为了解决这个问题，我认为普遍实行二部制，是一个较好的办法。
    中小学实行二部制，不是没有缺点的，它给学校和家长都带来了一定的困难。天津自从1956年下半年实行了二部制以后，有不少儿童由于课外活动没有很好地加以组织和辅导，而他们又不会安排自己的生活，因而成群地在街上游荡，有的还沾染上了一些不良习气，嬉戏打闹，不遵守纪律，影响交通秩序。有些家长指责学校管理松弛，有些人还对二部制发生了怀疑，认为二部制应当停止。我们不能否认二部制存在着一定的困难和缺点，但是不能因为有这些困难和缺点，便抹煞了它的优点。我们必须看到实行了二部制的学校，教学工作基本上是正常的，绝大部分学生的学业成绩是很好的，共产主义的道德品质在广大学生中已经成长起来，这些成绩是主要的，而那些存在的缺点是次要的，只要我们正视这些缺点，它是完全可以克服的。我们可以设想，如果不实行二部制，就不可避免地发生两个问题，或者是由国家拨出大量资金来建筑校舍，或者是听任大批儿童失去学习的机会。仅就天津来说，如果不实行二部制，要使所有学生都能在校学习，就必须新建中学四十三所、小学一百四十所，需要国家投资五千九百五十万元。不新建这样多的学校，就要有十八万五千学生失学。这只是天津一个地方的情况，如果从全国来看，这个问题就更加严重了。建筑全国中小学生所需要的校舍，就必然要减少基建投资，削弱经济建设的力量，影响社会主义工业化的速度，很显然这样做是不好的。现在我们既然不能筹拨大量资金来新建和扩建校舍，又不能听任大批学生失学，只有广泛地推行中小学的二部制，并且把二部制办好。不这样做，中小学生的升学和入学问题，就目前情况看来，是很难得到完满解决的。
    实行二部制不一定能够全部解决中、小学生的学习问题，但至少可以解决绝大部分的问题。就天津市说，实行二部制的初中班级，约占班级总数的86％，实行二部制的小学班级约占班级总数的76％，如果中小学全部实行二部制还可以增收学生十万人以上，其他地区实行二部制的情况，我们虽然不了解，但是由于二部制刚在推行，可能还不够普遍，存在着一定的潜力。我的意见，凡是不能全部容纳中小学生的地区，都适当推行二部制。
  全面安排学生课外活动
    为了克服二部制的缺点，天津市人民委员会曾经研究了这个问题，并且决定采取以下的几个措施：
      （1）在小学三年级以上和初中学生中，积极逐步地普遍建立家庭学习小组。小组活动的内容，以复习和做作业为主，并根据学生年龄的特征和兴趣，组织多样化的活动，如收听广播、游戏、文体活动、家庭劳动等，这种家庭学习小组将是加强对学生课外和校外辅导的一个主要方法。
      （2）确定各区街道办事处负有组织、指导二部制学生校外活动的任务；并指导居民委员会和工人家属委员会协助家庭学习小组的活动。
      （3）实行二部制的学校，设专职辅导员，专管学生课外和校外活动的组织指导，并经常与社会文体活动机构及街道办事处等取得密切联系，以便于互相配合。
      （4）组织动员社会上各方面的力量，支持和配合二部制学生的课外和校外活动。如广播电台、各文化馆、影剧院、图书馆、体育场，各公共场所以及各机关、企业等单位，都尽可能给以协助和支持。
      （5）有条件的学校试行低年级学生上、下午各二节课的“二二制”，以减少儿童连续半天上课的疲劳。
    为了保证上述措施的贯彻实施，还责成各级教育行政部门加强对学校教育工作的领导；在市教育局与各区人民委员会的领导下，成立市和各区的学生课外活动指导委员会，对学生课外活动进行全面指导和安排；研究制定学校专职辅导员与街道办事处及社会文体机构兼职辅导员的工作方法，建立经常的联系制度，在工作中密切配合。市人民委员会还强调了学校教师应当巩固地树立起对学生全面负责的教育思想，要求教师纠正“只管教，不管导”，
  “只管课内不管课外”的思想；对于学生家长则号召他们要关心自己子女的成长，加强同学校和街道的联系，要求家长改变把教育子女的责任完全推给学校的思想。这样在学校、家庭和社会各方面的配合下，由于实行二部制所产生的一些困难和缺点，是一定可以逐步克服的。
    我们认为二部制是在当前和今后一个相当长的时期内解决中小学生学习问题的一个较好的办法，但是因为推行不久，还没有取得一个比较完整的经验。希望教育部重视这一制度，在全国范围内大力推行，同时不断总结和交流各地的先进经验，使二部制更加健全起来。（附图片）
