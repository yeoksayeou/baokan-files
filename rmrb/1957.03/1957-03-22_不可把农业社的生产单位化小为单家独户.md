It is Impermissible to Reduce the Production Unit of Agricultural Cooperatives to Individual Households
　　Jian Hong
　　In some places, the following argument is popular: "The smaller the contracting unit for agricultural production cooperatives, the the better." Specifically, it is believed that contracting to a team is better than contracting to a squad, and contracting to a household or individual is even better. Under the guidance of this idea, some agricultural cooperatives have universally implemented the method of household management of farmland or the implementation of individual responsibility land for a long time without careful consideration. This is actually reducing the production unit to one household or one person. Although this small-scale production under the unified management and unified planning guidance of the entire cooperative is not exactly the same as individual small-scale farming, many disadvantages of small-scale farming that are not conducive to improving production will also occur in small-scale production units of individual households. After the Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative in Fuyang County, Anhui Province, universally implemented the method of household field management for a long time, some households with less labor, weaker labor, incomplete or poor farming tools, or poor management experience encountered many difficulties in production. In order to overcome the difficulties, some households voluntarily combined again. After the Haiyan Agricultural Cooperative in Yuci County, Shanxi Province, universally implemented the system of individual responsibility land last year, it divided a large 400-mu cotton field cultivated by tractors into more than 100 plots, which were managed by more than 100 male and female members with very different technical levels. In this way, the expertise of some people with special technical skills can only be brought into play on a few acres of land; at the same time, many people who lack technical skills lose regular and specific guidance and assistance. As a result, cotton plants of varying sizes grew on this piece of land with exactly the same soil quality, fertility, and cultivation conditions: some were tall, some were short; some were blackish-green, some were yellow; one area had many bolls, and another had few. Because production is too dispersed, it is difficult to lead and it is not easy to carry out collectivist education; on the contrary, this practice often helps to develop private ownership consciousness. This argument of "the smaller the contracting unit, the better" and the practice of reducing the production unit to individual households essentially doubts the superiority of collective production and negates or weakens this superiority in actual production activities.
　　It is undeniable that some agricultural cooperatives experienced some idleness and confusion in production last year. The reason for this phenomenon is mainly because the labor organization, work-day calculation, and political education work were not done well; we must not therefore doubt the superiority of collective labor. Every member of the cooperative and rural grass-roots cadres should understand that the superiority of collective production cannot be realized only by working together, but can only be manifested by collective cooperation under reasonable organizational leadership that meets the actual needs of production. Many members of agricultural cooperatives with certain experience in collective labor know that as long as division of labor and specialization are implemented and well coordinated, collective production can give full play to the role of labor, capital, technology and all means of production, thereby opening up broad avenues for agricultural and sideline production and basic construction, and can effectively overcome the difficulties of insufficient labor, animal power, technology and production funds. For example, in drought-resistant planting, it is not as fast and good for everyone to carry water, dig pits, and plant seeds as it is for those who carry water to specialize in carrying water, those who dig pits to specialize in digging pits, and those who plant seeds to specialize in planting seeds. Doing so can also rationally use strength according to the strength of labor and the level of technology, so that many auxiliary labor forces have work to do. Taking the above example, strong laborers can carry water, those who can master the technology of depth can dig pits, and auxiliary laborers can plant seeds.

　　Last year, production teams in many agricultural cooperatives did encounter many problems in production. Many members of the cooperative only cared about getting more work points and did not care about quality. They avoided heavy work and took the easy way out. They had to shout left and right before going to the fields every day, and even during the busy farming season, they were still late to the fields and early to go home. Management was also very chaotic. Some production team leaders, because they could not grasp the growth of various crops and the amount of work required for each piece of land, not only could not cultivate and fertilize in a timely manner, but also stayed up all night arranging work. If the situation changed, they could not promptly revise unreasonable quotas, and many urgent tasks were often not assigned, and the phenomenon of idleness was very serious. Can it be said that these many problems are caused by the production unit being too large? If this is indeed the main reason, wouldn't it be possible to solve all problems as long as the production unit is reduced? The facts of many agricultural cooperatives show that the situation is not like this. The production unit being too large is only one factor causing confusion, not the main reason. As long as we delve deeper into the problems that have occurred, we can see that the contradiction between small-scale farming habits and collective production methods has the most serious impact on collective production. This contradiction is manifested in two aspects:
　　(1) The contradiction between socialist production relations and the psychology of small farmers. In the individual production of individual households, farmers not only cherish the land and all means of production, but also are very concerned about the fruits of their labor, and can actively work and do their best to ensure quality. In this narrow scope of production, they have developed the habit of looking at problems with a narrow perspective. After the cooperative, the scope of production has expanded, and many members of the cooperative cannot see the relationship between collective labor and personal income; even if they understand it in principle, it is not easy to combine it in their hearts. Therefore, many people know that more work means more pay, but they still arrive late to the fields and go home early; they know that everyone's good work can increase production and increase income, but they only compete for work points and do not care about quality. To overcome this contradiction, it is necessary to strengthen and improve a series of tasks, such as appropriate work recording, reasonable remuneration, no deviations in distribution, and frequent and effective persuasion and education; trying to solve the problem simply by contracting work and production to households is not worth the loss.
　　(2) The contradiction between collective production methods and small-scale farming habits. Many agricultural cooperatives lack planning in daily production, and adopt the working methods of "temporary grabs" and "old sheep driving mountains" to solve problems when they encounter them. Many members of the cooperative are accustomed to taking care of themselves and are not accustomed to collective labor. After encountering difficulties in labor management, they do not want to strengthen management by other means, but believe that to strengthen the responsibility system, it is necessary to divide the land into small plots and let each person or household manage it according to the method of small-scale farming; this is only a concession to backward small-scale farming habits, and this cannot fundamentally solve the problem. In fact, many old cooperatives have organized collective labor very well, and their experience should be conscientiously summarized and promoted; at the same time, it is also necessary to conduct a long-term ideological struggle against old habits. Otherwise, even good experience will not be learned or will not work.
　　　　＊　　＊　　＊
　　Of course, reducing the size of the production unit is not completely wrong in all situations. In the high tide of the cooperative movement, many cooperatives, disregarding the needs of production, simply based on secondary conditions such as the number of key members, the living conditions of the members, and the convenience of the management committee's leadership, blindly formed large production teams of one or two hundred households based on villages or the original small cooperatives. If the team is too large, the production situation is complicated, and it is difficult for the team leader to directly direct the specific arrangement of production, labor, and farm work, and must rely on the team to do it. Such production units should not only be reduced, but also must be reduced in actual production. For these teams that are too large, the question is not whether to reduce them, but to what extent is it good to reduce them. It should be considered: (1) Can the team leader directly direct production; (2) Can each production team guarantee to do all the work for the entire year on the section of land it is responsible for; (3) Can the agricultural and sideline industries of each team be combined year-round. The first two conditions are particularly important. No matter how you consider it, it is always unnecessary and harmful to carry out production without taking the production team as the basic unit and reducing the production unit to one household or three or two households.

　　不可把农业社的生产单位化小为单家独户
　　剑虹
    有些地方流行着这样一种论调：“农业生产合作社的包工包产单位越小越好。”具体地说，就是认为包到组比包到队好，包到户或个人更好。在这种思想指导下，有些农业社没有认真仔细考虑，就普遍推行了较长时间内农田分户管理或实行个人责任地的办法。这实际上是把生产单位化小到一家或一个人了。这种在全社统一经营和统一计划指导下所进行的小单位生产，虽然不完全和个体的小农生产一样，但是，小农生产中许多不利于提高生产的缺点，在单家独户的小生产单位中也是同样会发生的。安徽阜阳县新华农业社普遍推行较长时间内的分户田间管理办法以后，有些劳力少而弱、农具不全或不好、管理经验很差的农户，在生产中发生了不少困难。为了克服困难，有些户又自动地结合了起来。山西榆次县的海燕农业社，去年普遍实行个人责任地的制度以后，把拖拉机耕种的一块四百亩大的棉田分成了一百多块，由一百多个技术水平很不相同的男女社员分管起来。这样，就使一部分有技术特长的人的特长只能在几亩田上发挥作用；同时，许多缺乏技术的人，却失掉了经常的具体的指导和帮助。结果，这块土质、肥量和耕种条件完全相同的土地上，却生长出了参差不齐的棉花：有的高，有的低；有的发黑绿色，有的呈黄色；一片结铃多，一片结铃少。由于生产太分散，很难领导，也不容易进行集体主义的教育；相反，这种做法却常常在助长私有意识的发展。这种“包工包产单位越小越好”的论调和把生产单位缩小到单人独户的做法，实质上是对于集体生产的优越性有所怀疑，并在实际生产活动中否定或削弱了这种优越性。
    不可否认，去年有些农业社在生产上发生了一些窝工和混乱现象。所以有这种现象发生，主要是因为劳动组织、劳动日计算以及政治教育工作没有做好；绝不能因此怀疑集体劳动的优越性。每个社员和农村的基层干部都应该懂得：集体生产的优越性，不是仅靠在一起劳动就能实现的，而是要在切合实际生产需要的合理的组织领导下集体协作，才能表现出来的。集体劳动有一定经验的农业社，许多社员都晓得：只要实行分工分业又很好地配合，集体生产就能充分发挥劳力、资金、技术和一切生产资料的作用，从而可以打开农业副业生产和基本建设的宽广门路，并能有效地克服劳力、畜力、技术和生产资金不足的困难。如抗旱点种，每个人都挑水、刨坑、点种，就不及挑水的专挑、刨坑的专刨、点种的专点种要来得快而好。这样做，并且能按劳力强弱、技术高低，合理地使用力量，可以使许多辅助劳力都有活儿可做。就以上述例子来说：强劳力可挑水，能掌握深浅技术的可以刨坑，辅助劳力就可点种。
            ＊　　＊　　＊
    去年，不少农业社的生产队，在生产中确实发生了不少问题。许多社员只顾多得工分，不顾质量，做活时避重就轻，每天要左喊右等才上地，甚至在农忙时也同样是迟上地早回家。管理工作上也很乱，有些生产队长因掌握不住各种作物的生长情况和每块土地的需工量，不但不能适时耕作、施肥，而且天天熬夜排工。情况变了也不能及时修正不合理的定额，许多急需进行的活往往派不下去，窝工现象也很严重。能不能说：这许多问题都是由于生产单位太大而发生的呢？如果这真是主要的原因，只要把生产单位化小了，不是就可以解决一切问题了吗？许多农业社的事实说明，情况并不是如此。生产单位太大只是发生混乱的一种因素，并不是主要的原因。只要根据所发生的问题深追一步，就可看到影响集体生产最严重的是小农经营习惯和集体生产方式的矛盾。这矛盾表现在两个方面：
    （一）社会主义生产关系和小农心理的矛盾。在一家一户的个体生产中，农民既爱护土地和一切生产资料，又非常关心劳动成果，并能积极劳动和尽力保证质量。他们在这狭小的生产范围内，已养成了用狭小的眼光看问题的习惯。合作化以后，生产范围扩大了，许多社员看不清集体劳动和个人收益的关系；即使从道理上想通了，从心里还是不容易结合起来的。因此，许多人明知多劳多得，仍然要迟到地早回家；明知人人干得好才能增加生产、增加收入，却又只争工分不顾质量。要克服这个矛盾，必须加强和改进一系列的工作，如记工恰当、报酬合理、分配中不出偏差、经常能进行有力的说服教育等等；想简单地用包工包产包到户的办法来解决问题，那是得不偿失的。
    （二）集体生产方式和小农经营习惯的矛盾。许多农业社日常生产缺乏计划性，遇问题采取“临时一把抓”“老羊赶山”的工作方法来解决。许多社员习惯于各顾各，不习惯于集体劳动。在劳动管理上遇到困难以后，不想别的办法加强管理，反认为要加强责任制，就必须按小农经营的办法，把土地分成小块让各人或各户去管；这只是对落后的小农经营习惯的迁就，这不能从根本上解决问题。事实上，已经有不少老社的集体劳动组织得很好，应该切实总结和推广它们的经验；同时，还必须对旧习惯进行长期的思想斗争。不然，有好的经验也会学不到或者行不通。
              ＊　　＊　　＊
    当然，化小生产单位，并不是在任何情况下都是完全错误的。在合作化运动的高潮中，许多合作社不顾生产的需要，单纯依据骨干数量、社员居住情况和管委会领导方便等等次要条件，盲目地以村或原来的小社为基础，组成了一二百户的大生产队。队太大，生产情况复杂，队长很难直接指挥生产、劳力、农活的具体安排，必依靠小组去做。这样的生产单位，不仅应该化小，在实际生产中也势必要化小。对这些太大的队来说，问题不在于该不该化小，而在于小到什么程度为好。应该考虑：（一）队长能不能直接指挥生产；（二）每个生产队能不能保证做好所负责的地段上常年的全部工作；（三）各个队的农副业能不能常年结合。特别重要的是前两个条件。不论怎么考虑，不以生产队为基本单位进行生产，而把生产单位缩小为一家一户或三家两户，总是没有必要的，而且是有害的。
