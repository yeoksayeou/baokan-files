　　Active Work of Fujian CPPCC's Special Working Groups

　　Li Shuzhong said: In order to further utilize the role of the People's Democratic United Front and to adapt to the upsurge of the socialist revolution, the Fujian CPPCC established ten special working groups. Through a series of activities and work by the working groups, the CPPCC's prestige among the masses has greatly increased. However, as it is a new endeavor, and there isn't much experience in determining what work should be done and how it should be done, the general work is still unfolding through exploration.

　　In 1956, to further utilize the role of the People's Democratic United Front and to adapt to the requirements of the upsurge of the socialist revolution, the Fujian Provincial CPPCC newly established five groups for political and legal affairs, literature and art, medicine and health, political parties, and religion, and adjusted and expanded the five existing groups for the liberation of Taiwan, industry and commerce, overseas Chinese affairs, education, and science and technology. Currently, there are ten groups in total. The general tasks of the working groups are: to combine with the central tasks of the Party and the government, closely connect with the masses, widely collect opinions, conduct special research on relevant major issues, and reflect opinions and make suggestions to relevant state organs; to discuss and consult on major issues related to the group according to the arrangements of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC, to frequently promote various policies and laws, and to unite and educate the people they are in contact with; to assist the Standing Committee in studying and handling proposals, opinions, and suggestions collected at the plenary meetings of the CPPCC, and to organize the exchange of experiences, etc. Since the second half of last year, the working groups have been active, with the ten working groups conducting a total of sixty-four different activities, including forty-one working meetings, eighteen symposiums, two written forums, and three reports, inspections, and visits. Through a series of activities and work, the CPPCC's prestige among the masses has greatly increased, and certain achievements have been made. These can be summarized into the following three points:

　　Three Achievements in the Work

　　(1) Widely reflecting the opinions of the masses, playing a consultative and supervisory role in the government's administration: The activities of the working groups are based on the spirit of joint research and consultation. Participants from all walks of life at various meetings are generally able to speak freely and without reservation on relevant issues, based on the spirit of knowing everything and saying everything. For example, after the Central Committee of the Communist Party put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," the education and literature and art working groups separately convened symposiums for people from higher education and literary and art circles. At the symposiums, in addition to criticizing the worship of authority and sectarian sentiments, many opinions and suggestions were put forward on the unity of old and young professors, teaching syllabus and textbooks, and scientific research equipment. The science and technology working group convened a symposium on the wage reform issues in higher education institutions, discussing the issues arising from the wage reform and putting forward many suggestions for improving the wage reform work. The medicine and health working group convened symposiums for medical personnel on "nursing work," "advancing towards science," "hospital administrative work," and "publicly funded medical treatment for cadres," respectively. Many famous Chinese and Western medicine doctors fully expressed their opinions on the above issues at the symposiums and put forward many reform methods and suggestions. In other areas, such as the overlapping issues of the development of organizations by various democratic parties, the cooperation between public and private parties in industry and commerce, issues existing in the implementation of policies related to overseas Chinese, religion, ethnic minorities, and other aspects, the relevant working groups have successively invited responsible comrades from relevant departments to participate in symposiums, where full discussions and consultations were conducted. The working groups compiled many of the opinions and suggestions put forward and provided them to relevant departments for reference, helping relevant departments to promote and improve their work. For example, after receiving feedback from the symposium on wage reform issues in higher education institutions, the Provincial Party Committee's Department of Culture and Education and the Provincial Wage Reform Office contacted relevant departments and convened a meeting of the heads of various colleges and universities to study the causes of the existing problems and solutions. Subsequently, each college and university conducted a general inspection and adjusted unreasonable aspects. Another example is the issue of disrespect for medical personnel by government cadres. Through feedback, it received great attention from Party and government leaders. The Provincial People's Committee issued regulations on outpatient and inpatient treatment for government cadres and published them in the Fujian Daily. This immediately took effect, mainly manifested in (1) Many government patients who previously did not leave the hospital even after recovering now voluntarily request to be discharged, (2) The phenomenon of patients thinking that publicly funded medical treatment does not require them to pay out of their own pockets, and demanding tonic medicine, X-rays, and hospitalization at every turn, and making unreasonable demands if their goals are not achieved, has been reversed, (3) Patients respect the hospital, and medical personnel have greatly improved their enthusiasm and sense of responsibility, (4) Previously, most hospitals were in deficit, but after the regulations were promulgated, the bed turnover rate increased, the number of people treated increased, and the hospital's funding also had a surplus. From the above examples, it can be seen that the working group's reflection of opinions has played a significant role in assisting and supervising the work of relevant departments.

　　(2) Strengthening the publicity and education of people from all walks of life, expanding the united front of the CPPCC: The members and activity targets of the ten working groups are very broad, and the vast majority are representative people from all aspects of society. Through the work of the working groups, regular contacts have been established, facilitating policy promotion and ideological education for them, and expanding and strengthening the internal unity of the People's Democratic United Front. For example, when the state issued important policies and guidelines, the CPPCC central group invited responsible people from relevant departments to give special reports, launched discussions, summarized opinions and existing problems from all parties, and made an explanation or clarification report. This was then conveyed by the central group to various democratic parties and people's organizations. In the Fuzhou area alone, it directly and indirectly influenced and promoted the active learning and improved understanding of more than 4,000 middle and upper-level democratic people. Another example is the Taiwan Liberation Working Group, which has visited and contacted twenty-eight upper-level figures from the old military and political circles since the second half of last year. After the promotion of the policy of peaceful liberation of Taiwan, their concerns were eliminated. Some members of the various working groups are responsible comrades from relevant state organs. At various meetings, they explain or make necessary self-criticisms regarding the main issues, opinions, and suggestions raised by everyone, which has a great effect on unifying everyone's policy understanding, exerting democracy, and further uniting and educating them. For example, Ni Songmao, the leader of the Science and Technology Group, said: "The activities of the working group are a good way for the CPPCC to contact a wide range of people in society." Medical personnel wrote in letters: "The CPPCC's contact with us is a concrete embodiment of the Party and government's concern for us, which has greatly encouraged our work."

　　(3) Mobilizing all positive factors to promote people from all walks of life to participate in national construction: Through the activities of the CPPCC's various working groups, multi-faceted contacts have been established directly with people from all walks of life. This makes it possible to better mobilize and organize social forces in all aspects and promote them to play an active role in various national undertakings. For example, in order to strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, since April of last year, the Taiwan Liberation Working Group has mobilized and organized members of various democratic parties, upper and middle-level figures from the old military and political circles, and relevant social figures to write sixty-one open letters and radio scripts to Taiwan. Eight of the more important articles were broadcast by the Central People's Broadcasting Station, and progressive newspapers in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia published them in prominent positions, which played a certain propaganda role. For example, in order to strive for overseas students, scientists and technicians to participate in the construction of the motherland, various working groups discussed separately, promoted all walks of life to conduct investigations and understanding, and from mid-September to the end of November last year, eighty-five foreign science and technology experts had been identified, many of whom are atomic energy experts, electrical, mechanical, and engineering talents, and various medical talents. Facts have proved that it is of great importance to widely absorb people from all aspects of society through work and participate in the construction of the motherland.

　　Main Reasons for Achievements

　　The launch of the CPPCC working group has achieved some success, mainly due to:

　　(1) Party and government attention and strong support. Through the supervision of the Provincial Party Committee and the attention and support of various government departments, any opinions or suggestions reflected by the masses are studied and handled and answered at any time. The masses' opinions are valued, which strengthens their confidence and brings them closer to the CPPCC, thereby gradually improving and expanding the CPPCC's prestige and role.

　　(2) Democratic parties played an active role in promoting. Among all members of the group, the majority are members of democratic parties and the masses they are in contact with. Therefore, the activities of various working groups directly promoted members of democratic parties and the masses they are in contact with. Many of the leaders and deputy leaders of various working groups are arranged according to the nature of the united objects of the democratic parties. For example, the China Democratic League (CDL) is related to the cultural and educational circles, and the literary and art groups are related; the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party (CPWDP) is related to the science and technology medical and health fields. In order to facilitate contact and more fully reflect the opinions of the masses, the CDL or CPWDP mostly serves as the leader or deputy leader. The leaders, deputy leaders, and members have organizational relationships in peacetime, and they dare to express their opinions as much as possible, which makes the meetings often active and not stagnant. Secondly, the group secretaries are mostly concurrently held by cadres of various democratic parties. They are more familiar with the members and easy to contact, and they can have an in-depth understanding of the problems they face. Third, the chairmen of the democratic parties also serve as vice-chairmen of the CPPCC. At the meetings of the chairman and vice-chairmen, they can participate in the processing opinions based on the issues raised by each group; the vice-chairmen also participate in the guiding meetings of the working groups in accordance with the nature of the objects they are in contact with. In addition, ideological or work problems that are relatively common or exist among members of democratic parties are often reflected to the working group through members for discussion, and suggestions are made to relevant departments. For example, when dealing with problems, if the opinions of the working group are not valued, the responsible persons of the democratic parties also serve as members of the Provincial People's Committee, so they can raise them at the meetings of the Provincial People's Committee, so that the problems can be solved. In this way, the close cooperation between the democratic parties and the CPPCC has played a great role in handling internal contradictions of the people and strengthening the united front work.

　　(3) Strengthen planning and do a good job of pre-meeting preparations: The work plans of each working group must be formulated according to the overall task requirements of the CPPCC and the central work of relevant departments in each period, and opinions must be collected from all aspects in advance to ensure that they are specific and feasible. To hold a meeting, it is necessary to collect information widely in advance, select activity content, arrange time, and determine the targets; before the meeting, it is necessary to notify the content, explain the significance of the meeting, and promote them to collect and reflect more feedback and opinions among the masses. This makes it possible to grasp the central content and meet everyone's wishes, the enthusiasm will be high, the speeches will be active, and the reflection of problems and attendance rate will also be higher.

　　(4) The activities of the working group are closely linked to state organs and democratic parties, so it is important to maintain close contact with these relevant departments, collect activity data from various groups, and strive for activity coordination, which is an important method to enrich the activity content of the groups and assist relevant departments in promoting their work. The activities of the group should be flexible, mobile, and diversified. In addition to convening group meetings and special-subject seminars, report meetings, written discussions, individual visits, and organizing group members to conduct on-the-spot investigations and research should be adopted more often, so that the activities of the group can be more active and effective.

　　(5) Groups with a wide range of nature should carry out group activities and invite more people to participate; sometimes, relevant people can be temporarily invited to participate according to the nature of the topic, so that opinions from all parties can be collected more comprehensively, and the research and reflection of the problems can be more prominent and concentrated. The feedback and opinions collected and the suggestions put forward must be provided to relevant departments for reference in a timely manner, and efforts must be made to ensure that relevant departments are effectively responsible for handling them, and that they are settled and explained as much as possible. This will encourage everyone to actively reflect opinions and make suggestions.

　　Current Shortcomings

　　There are still many shortcomings in carrying out the work of the group:

　　(1) They do not understand the nature and tasks of the CPPCC well enough, and their understanding of the united front policy is not deep enough: Reflected in the members of various groups, some are not active enough in reflecting opinions and are not very enthusiastic in speaking, which makes the activities of various groups unbalanced; reflected in government departments, some do not support and value the opinions or suggestions reflected by various groups enough, and the handling is not timely enough, and some simply ignore them.

　　(2) Due to too few cadres, they cannot conduct in-depth investigations and analysis and research when sorting out the opinions reflected by various groups. Important ones should be submitted as special cases, and secondary ones should only be provided for reference, so that relevant departments can distinguish between primary and secondary when dealing with problems and solve them reasonably. Otherwise, too many opinions are reflected, some are correct, and some still have problems, so they will shirk, or even delay the processing, which affects the enthusiasm of the group members who reflect the opinions.

　　Special working groups are a new endeavor. There is not much experience in determining what work should be done and how it should be done, so the general work is still unfolding through exploration. After doing a period of work and gaining some experience, joint meetings of group leaders or secretaries of each group have not been convened in a timely manner to conduct experience exchanges and summarize the work, so that the work of each group can be developed more balanced and improved further on the existing basis.

　　Some of these problems belong to the category of ideological awareness, and will be better resolved in the future with the improvement of ideological understanding, especially the deep understanding of the united front policy; some belong to the problem of work experience. It is hoped that the National CPPCC will strengthen guidance in the future and continue to supervise, so that the work of the Fujian Provincial CPPCC will continue to make new progress.

　　福建政协的专门工作小组工作活跃
　  李述中说：为了进一步发挥人民民主统一战线的作用和适应社会主义革命高潮的要求，福建政协建立了十个专门工作小组。通过工作组一系列的活动和工作，政协在群众中的威信有了很大提高。但由于它是一项新的工作，究竟该做那些工作，工作要怎样做，经验不多，因此一般工作还是从摸索中展开的。
    1956年福建省政协为了进一步发挥人民民主统一战线的作用和适应社会主义革命高潮的要求，新建立了政法、文艺、医药卫生、党派、宗教五个组并将过去原有解放台湾、工商、华侨、教育、科技五个组加以调整和扩大，目前共有十个组。工作组总的任务是：结合党和政府的中心任务，密切联系群众，广泛搜集意见，对有关的重大问题进行专题研究，向有关国家机关反映意见和提出建议；根据本会常务委员会的布置，对本组有关的重大问题进行讨论协商，经常宣传各项政策法令，对所联系的人士进行团结教育；协助常务委员会研究处理本会全体会议收集的提案、意见和建议，组织交流经验等，去年下半年来，工作组的活动是活跃的，十个工作组共进行了各种不同的活动六十四次，其中包括工作会议四十一次，座谈会十八次，笔谈会二次，报告会、视察、参观等三次。通过一系列的活动和工作，政协在群众中的威信有了很大提高，并取得了一定的成绩，归纳起来，有下述三点：
　　工作中的三点成绩
      （一）广泛反映群众意见，对政府施政起协商和监督作用：工作组的活动是从共同研究协商的精神出发，参加各种会议的各界人士，一般能够本着知无不言、言无不尽的精神出发，对有关问题进行较无顾虑的发言。如中共中央提出百花齐放，百家争鸣政策后，教育、文艺工作组即分别召开了高等教育界和文艺界人士座谈会，在座谈会上除对崇拜权威、宗派情绪进行批判以外，对老教授和青年教授的团结问题，教学大纲和教材问题，科学研究资料的设备问题提出了许多意见和建议。科技工作组曾召开了高等学校工资改革问题座谈会，针对工资改革中所产生的一些问题进行了讨论，提出了搞好工资改革工作的许多建议。医药卫生工作组就“护理工作”、“向科学进军问题”、“医院行政工作”、“干部公费治疗问题”等分别召开了医务界人士座谈会，许多著名中西医师在座谈会上对以上几个问题都充分发表了意见，并提出许多改革的办法和建议。其它如有关各民主党派发展组织的交叉问题，工商业公私双方共事问题，华侨、宗教、少数民族、以及其他各项政策贯彻中存在的问题，有关工作小组都先后邀请有关部门负责同志参加座谈会，在会上进行了充分的讨论和协商。工作组将提出的许多意见和建议加以整理后，分别提供有关部门参考，帮助有关部门推动改进工作。如省委文教部、省工资改革办公室，接到高等学校工资改革问题座谈会的反映意见后，即与有关部门联系召开了各院、校负责人会议，研究存在问题的原因和解决问题的办法，随后各院、校普遍进行了一次检查，同时对不合理的地方也进行了调整。又如机关干部不尊重医务人员问题，通过反映，得到党政领导的极大重视，由省人民委员会通过关于机关干部患病门诊及住院规定并在福建日报公布，这一来效果立见，主要表现是（1）过去有许多机关病员，病好不出院，现在都自动要求出院，（2）病员认为公费治疗不要自己掏腰包，动不动就要吃补药、照光、住院，不达目的就无理取闹的现象已有扭转，
  （3）病员尊重了医院，医务人员也因而大大提高积极性和责任心。（4）以前医院多数亏空，规定公布后，病床周转率增加了，治病的人次增加了，医院的经费亦有盈余了。由以上例子可以看到工作组的反映意见，对有关部门工作的协助和监督是起了不少的作用。
      （二）加强对各界人士的宣传和教育，扩大了政协的团结面：十个工作组的成员和活动的对象很广泛，绝大部分是社会各方面的代表性人士，通过工作组的工作，建立了经常性联系，便利对他们进行政策宣传和思想教育，扩大和加强了人民民主统一战线的内部团结。如政协中心组，当国家发布重要政策方针时，即请有关部门负责人士做专题报告，展开讨论，归纳各方意见和存在问题，作了一次解答或说明报告，这样由中心组再传达至各民主党派各人民团体，仅福州一个地区，就直间接影响和推动了中上层民主人士四千多人的积极学习和提高认识。又如解放台湾工作组去年下半年来访问和联系旧军政界上层人士二十八人，经过和平解放台湾政策的宣传消除了他们的顾虑。各工作组成员中有的是有关国家机关的负责同志，在各种会议上，对大家所提出的主要问题的意见和建议都加以说明解释或做必要的检讨，给大家在政策认识上的统一，发挥民主和进一步对他们进行团结教育等有很大效果。如科技组组长倪松茂说：“工作组的活动是政协联系广泛社会人士的很好方式。”医务界人士来信中说：“政协对我们的联系是党和政府对我们关心的具体体现，对岗位工作起了很大鼓舞。”
      （三）调动一切积极因素，推动各界人士参加国家建设工作：通过政协各个工作组的活动，直接和各界人士建立了多方面联系，这样就可能更好的发动和组织各方面的社会力量，推动他们在国家各种事业中发挥积极作用。如解放台湾工作组，为了争取和平解放台湾，从去年四月以来，发动和组织了各民主党派成员、旧军政界中上层人士和有关社会人士，向台湾写公开信和广播稿六十一篇，其中较重要的八篇，除由中央人民广播电台广播外，香港和南洋进步报纸都以显著地位登载，起了一定的宣传作用。又如各工作组为了争取国外留学生科技人员参加祖国建设，各组分别讨论，推动各界进行调查了解，从去年9月中旬到11月底，已调查清楚的国外科技专家有八十五名，这些人许多是原子能专家，电机、机械、工程人材和各类医科人材。事实证明，通过工作广泛吸收散处在社会各方面的人士，参加祖国建设事业是有很大作用的。
    取得成绩的主要原因
    政协工作组展开活动是取得了一些成就，主要原因是由于：
      （一）党政重视和大力支持。通过省委督促，和政府各部门的重视和支持，凡群众反映的意见或建议，随时研究处理并作出答复，群众的意见被重视就加强信心，就更加靠拢政协，因而政协的威信和作用，就逐渐提高和扩大。
      （二）民主党派起了积极推动作用。全部组员中，属于民主党派成员和所联系的群众是占多数的，因此，各个工作组的活动，就直接推动了民主党派成员和所联系的群众，各个工作组正副组长很多是按各民主党派团结对象的性质来安排的。例如民盟和文教界、文艺组有关，农工党和科技医卫有关，为便于联系和更全面的反映群众意见，多由民盟或农工分任正副组长，正副组长和成员平时有组织关系，有意见敢于尽量发表，这就使会议经常活跃，不至沉滞。其次，小组秘书多由各民主党派干部兼任，他们对组员比较熟悉，联系容易，对于他们所存在的问题亦能深入了解。第三，民主党派主委多兼任政协副主席，在主席、副主席会议上，能针对各组提出的问题参加处理意见；各副主席又按照工作所联系的对象性质参加工作组指导会议进行。此外，民主党派成员中，发生或存在比较普遍性的思想问题或工作问题，并经常透过成员反映至工作组讨论，向有关部门作出建议。如在处理问题时工作组意见未被重视，民主党派负责人多兼省人民委员会委员，就可以在省人民委员会会议上提出来，使问题获得解决，这样民主党派和政协工作紧密配合，对于处理人民内部矛盾，加强统一战线工作，实起了很大的作用。
      （三）加强计划性，做好会前准备工作：各工作组的工作计划，必须根据政协总的任务要求和有关部门每个时期的中心工作来制订，并且事先要多方面征集意见，订得具体而又切实可行。举行会议，事先应广泛收集情况，选择活动内容，安排时间，确定对象；会前要通知内容，说明会议意义，并推动他们在群众中多收集反映和意见，这样就可能抓住中心内容，也符合大家的愿望，情绪就会热烈，发言踊跃，反映问题和出席率亦较高。
      （四）工作组的活动内容和方式：组的活动内容，都和国家机关及民主党派有关切的联系，因此，经常和这些有关部门取得密切的联系，多方收集各组活动资料，争取活动配合，是丰富组的活动内容和协助有关部门推动工作的一项重要方法。组的活动方式，要灵活机动和多样化，除召开小组会、各科专门问题座谈会外，应多采取报告会、笔谈、个别访问和组织组员进行实地调查研究，这样组的活动就能更活跃，收效亦较大。
      （五）性质范围较广的小组应进行分组活动，邀请更多人士参加；有时可按专题性质，临时邀请有关人士参加，就能比较全面地收集各方意见，使研究和反映的问题更加突出和集中。对于收集反映和意见以及提出的建议必须及时提供有关部门参考，并争取有关部门切实负责处理，尽量做到有着落，有交代，这样才能鼓舞大家反映意见和提出建议的积极性。
      当前存在的缺点
    当前在开展组的工作上，还存在许多缺点：
      （一）对政协性质任务，还不够了解，对统战政策体会还不够深刻：反映在各组组员间，有的对反映意见不够积极，发言不大踊跃，使各组活动不够平衡；反映在政府部门，有的就对各组反映意见或建议，支持重视不够，处理不够及时，有的根本置之不理。
      （二）由于干部太少对各组反映意见，在整理时不能深入调查，进行分析研究，重要的予以专案提出，次要的仅提供参考，使有关部门在处理问题时能分清主次，合理解决，否则反映意见太多，有的是对的，有的还有问题，他们就有所推托，甚至一概延搁处理，使反映意见的组员积极性受到影响。
    专门工作小组是一项新的工作，究竟该做那些工作，工作要怎样做，经验不多，因此一般工作还是从摸索中展开的，在做了一段工作取得一些经验后，又未能及时召开各小组组长或秘书联席会议，进行经验交流，做出工作总结，使各组工作发展得更平衡，并在现有基础上更提高一步。
    这些问题，有是属于思想意识范畴的，今后随着思想认识的提高，特别是对统战政策的深刻体会，将得到更好解决；有的属于工作经验问题，希望全国政协今后加强指导，不断督促，使福建省政协的工作不断取得新的进展。（附图片）
