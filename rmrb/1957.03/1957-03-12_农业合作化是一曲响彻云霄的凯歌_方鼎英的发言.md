During the congress, I studied Chairman Mao's report on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" given at the enlarged session of the Supreme State Conference, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of this association and the summary report of the short-term training class for industrialists and businessmen, and Premier Zhou Enlai's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries. I fully endorse every work item and related argument proposed in these reports. I feel that every argument is based on facts, conforms to the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, and is reasonable and in line with the actual situation at home and abroad. This gives us a powerful weapon, telling us how to view the problems we encounter in our daily lives, that is, how to view the issues between ourselves and the enemy, how to view the internal problems of the people, how to view modern international issues, and how, in economic construction and ideological transformation, to use the method of investigation and research to analyze specific problems in order to arrive at correct conclusions. Only with the correct way of thinking can we recognize the correctness of the Party's leadership, thereby having full confidence to mobilize all forces to realize the Party's leading intentions and further build our country into a prosperous and happy socialist country on the basis of the basic victory of the socialist revolution.

In the process of the socialist revolution, the correct leadership of the Party is fundamental, but it cannot be said that with the correct leadership of the Party, no mistakes will be made in any aspect, especially since we are still a young country that has just won the socialist revolution, and the ideas of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie still exist like a vast ocean. Therefore, we will often sway left and right on many issues, unable to see the relationship between the major and minor, the partial and the whole. For example, agricultural cooperativization is a very correct path, but some people still have doubts. I now offer facts that I have personally witnessed to illustrate the superiority of agricultural cooperativization.

After the high tide of the socialist revolution in 1956, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the rural areas of Hunan have basically achieved the advanced form of agricultural cooperativization, eliminated the individual ownership of land, blocked the road that constantly generates capitalism, completely changed the face of the individual small-scale peasant economy, and greatly developed agricultural productive forces. Whether in improving farming systems, overcoming natural disasters, developing diversified operations, coordinating with the national economic development plan for production, or exploiting the potential of land and labor, it has incomparable superiority and has achieved brilliant results. Indeed, this is a song of triumph resounding through the skies in the process of the socialist revolution. However, in the great strides forward of the emerging socialist cause, certain local shortcomings and errors will inevitably occur, and some people will abandon the fundamental for the trivial, doubting the superiority of cooperatives, doubting whether cooperativization has been too fast and too early, so that they consciously or unconsciously waver, shrink back, and become passive in this regard, or have more or less revisionist sentiments. Last year, I went deep into the countryside twice for inspection. Now, based on what I have learned, I will talk about my personal impressions of agricultural cooperativization.

　　The Road of Cooperativization is Definitely the Right One

First, we absolutely affirm that the road of cooperativization is the right one. Facts have proven that cooperatives do have incomparable superiority. After the agricultural production organization in Hunan Province entered the advanced form of cooperativization, on the basis of collective production and unified management, a distribution system of remuneration according to labor was established. The enthusiasm and creativity of farmers in production was further stimulated, thereby improving the farming system, strengthening field management, tapping the potential of land, and increasing the utilization rate of labor. Last year, except for those seriously affected by disasters and reduced production, most cooperatives achieved increased production, and members increased their income. I have been to Liangtian Cooperative and Bailudong Cooperative in Chen County. Liangtian Cooperative had 693 households, and 609 households increased their income; Bailudong Cooperative had 261 households, and 249 households increased their income. Last year, the grain output in Guidong County increased by 11.43% compared with 1955. 98.3% of the cooperatives in the county increased production, and 93.2% of the members increased their income. After cooperativization in the spring of last year in Tongdao Dong Autonomous County, a production increase campaign centered on improving soil and improving farming techniques was launched throughout the county, enabling 96.4% of the cooperatives in the county to increase production and 90% of the farmers to increase their income. Last year, Hunan suffered the worst drought in nearly a century. After the beginning of summer, many areas did not have a thorough rain. The Heping Cooperative in Yongxing County, in the fight against the drought, dispatched 270 waterwheels, fighting heroically day and night, using 16-24 ladder waterwheels to draw water over the mountains, not only rescuing the crops, but also creating 218 mu of thousand-jin high-yield mu. If it were still a small-scale peasant economy with each household as a production unit, the severity of the disaster would be unimaginable. Historical facts also fully illustrate that terrible phenomenon. It is precisely because of the result of agricultural collectivization that a arduous struggle against drought was vigorously carried out, natural disasters were overcome, and the degree of disaster was avoided or reduced.

　　Farmers' Lives
　　Have Indeed Improved

Secondly, regarding the lives of farmers, I also have some understanding. In Yanquan Cooperative in Chen County, I visited member Kuang Weihui, who made five sets of clothes last year—one set of flannel, one set of khaki, one set of white bamboo cloth, and two sets of blue drill. Naturally, this is more prominent, but in general, there have been improvements. For example, in Shuisha Township, Longshan County, even under the drought situation last year, there were still 358 people who made 550 new clothes, 70 people made 70 new cotton-padded clothes, 60 households bought wool, and 37 households bought quilts. The purchasing power of farmers is indeed rising year by year. According to a typical survey in the Changde area: a survey of 40 farm households in Yuanjiang County in the plains area showed that the purchasing power in the third quarter of last year increased by 71.2% compared with the same period of the previous year; the Yufeng Agricultural Cooperative in Lian'an Township, Linli County in the hilly area, had a total income of the entire cooperative last year that increased by 77.5% compared with the previous year. The purchasing power of the collective part of the Shaping Cooperative in Cili County in the mountainous area increased by 2.85 times in the third quarter of last year compared with the same period of the previous year. Of course, this does not mean that the lives of farmers today are already very good and that there are no difficulties. Facts show that the lives of farmers are better than before the land reform and even better than before liberation; but it is still far from the ideal we require, and the difference is also very large compared with the urban life today. The documents of the Eighth National Congress pointed out: "The main contradiction in our country is the contradiction between the people's demand for the establishment of an advanced industrial country and the reality of a backward agricultural country, and the contradiction between the people's need for rapid economic and cultural development and the current economic and cultural situation that cannot meet the people's needs. The essence of this contradiction, under the conditions that our country's socialist system has been established, is the contradiction between the advanced socialist system and the backward social productive forces. The current main task of the Party and the people of the whole country is to concentrate our efforts to resolve the contradiction and turn our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country as soon as possible." Therefore, we must closely follow the high tide of cooperativization, set off a high tide of production development, and actively prepare for technological reform. The people of the whole country must also consciously practice increasing production and practicing economy to support the construction of the country's industry and agriculture. At the same time, we must plan the proportion of investment in industrial and agricultural construction in a more adaptable way, and arrange the proportion of accumulation and distribution more properly.

Again, I also saw: In today's agricultural transition to advanced forms of cooperativization, the vast rural areas have transformed the lofty ideal of "the old will be cared for until their death, the young will be nurtured to adulthood, and the widowed, lonely, and disabled will all be provided for" into living facts. The "five guarantees" have been implemented for orphans who are unable to work or are uncared for, or for the widowed, lonely, and disabled who have lost their labor force; at the same time, preferential labor days have been implemented for the families of revolutionary martyrs, so that they have received the warmth of socialism and personally experienced the benefits of agricultural cooperativization. When I was conducting interviews, they were filled with tears of gratitude for the great kindness of the Communist Party, the People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and some said: "Grandpa and Grandma are kind, but not as kind as the Communist Party and Chairman Mao."

　　Local and Temporary Shortcomings Can Be Overcome

In short, there are many benefits of agricultural cooperativization, but are there still shortcomings? As I mentioned earlier, problems did occur and exist in the great strides forward. For example, a small number of cooperatives are in a state of disintegration or semi-disintegration; the production of individual cooperatives, especially sideline production, has a spontaneous flow; some wealthy households want to abandon agriculture and engage in commerce and do business on their own; and some cooperative cadres have rigid work styles and mechanically copy things, and so on. But these are secondary, local, and temporary, and can be overcome. And since the launch of the rectification work, they have been or are being overcome, and the achievements are the main ones, and the socialist road is the right one. The socialist economy cannot be based on two different economic systems. Only when agriculture moves towards collectivization can it meet the requirements of socialist industrialization, can it forever eliminate capitalism in rural areas, and can it completely eliminate classes and eliminate exploitation. This is the essential problem. If we do not distinguish between right and wrong and confuse the primary and secondary, the essential and non-essential problems, this is not a Marxist-Leninist point of view, is not a realistic view, and is very harmful to consolidating and expanding the socialist victory. I believe that it is still necessary to conduct in-depth re-education on socialist ideology among all regions and all strata of the country.

My speech is over. Finally, I wish the conference a victory and the comrades good health! (Attached picture)

    农业合作化是一曲响彻云霄的凯歌
    方鼎英的发言
    在大会期间，我学习了毛主席在最高国务会议扩大会议所作的关于“正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告，李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划建议的说明，陈叔通副主席关于本会工作报告和工商业者短期讲习班工作总结报告和周恩来总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告。我完全拥护这些报告中所提出的每一个工作项目和有关的论点。我觉得每一个论点都是实事求是地既符合于马列主义的基本原理，而又入情入理地合乎国内外的实际情况，从而给我们一个有力的武器，告诉我们如何看我们生活中所时时刻刻要接触的一些问题，也就是如何看敌我之间的问题，如何看人民内部的问题，如何看现代的国际问题，以及在经济建设、思想改造等方面，如何用调查研究的方法，对具体的问题进行具体的分析，才能得出正确的结论，因为要有正确的思想方法，才能认识党的领导的正确性，从而有充分的信心，动员一切力量，来实现党的领导企图，把我们的国家在社会主义革命基本胜利的基础上，进一步建设成为一个富强幸福的社会主义国家。
    在社会主义革命进程中，党的正确领导是基本的，但不能说有了党的正确领导，就会在任何方面不犯错误了，特别我们还是一个年青的社会主义革命刚刚胜利的国家，资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想，还像汪洋大海地存在。因此，我们在许多问题上还会常常左右摇摆，看不清问题的主要和次要、局部和整体的关系。譬如农业合作化是一条很正确的道路，可是还有人在怀疑。我现在提供我个人亲眼看到的事实，来说明农业合作化的优越性。
    经过1956年社会主义革命的高潮，由于党和人民政府的正确领导，湖南农村已经基本上实现了高级形式的农业合作化，消灭了土地的个体所有制，堵塞了时刻产生资本主义的道路，使个体小农经济面貌完全改观，农业生产力获得很大的发展，不论在改进耕作制度、战胜自然灾害、开展多种经营、配合国民经济发展计划进行生产、发挥土地和劳动的潜力各方面，都有着无比的优越性，并已取得了光辉灿烂的成绩。的确，这是社会主义革命进程中一曲响彻云霄的凯歌。但新兴的社会主义事业在大踏步前进当中，不可避免地会发生某些局部的缺点和错误，而有些人就舍本逐末，怀疑合作社的优越性，怀疑合作化是否化得太快太早，以致自觉地或不自觉地在这方面动摇、畏缩、消极，或多或少的有些修正主义情绪。去年我曾两次深入农村进行视察，我现在就我所了解的一些情况，谈谈我个人对农业合作化的一些观感。
  合作化的道路肯定走对了
    首先，我们绝对肯定合作化的道路是走对了的。事实证明，合作社确实具有无比的优越性。湖南省农业生产组织进入高级形式的合作化以后，在集体生产、统一经营的基础上，树立了按劳取酬的分配制度，农民生产的积极性和创造性就得到进一步的发挥，从而改善了耕种制度，加强了田间管理，挖掘了土地潜力，提高了劳动利用率。去年除受灾严重的减产社外，一般都获得了增产，社员增加了收入。我到过郴县良田社和白鹿洞社，良田社六百九十三户，增加收入的有六百零九户；白鹿洞社二百六十一户，有二百四十九户增加了收入。桂东县去年粮食产量比1955年增加了11.43％，全县有98.3％的社增了产，93.2％的社员增加了收入。通道侗族自治县去年春季合作化后，全县掀起了以改良土壤、改进耕作技术为中心的增产运动，使全县96.4％的社增产，90％的农户增加了收入。湖南去年遭受近百年来未有的大旱灾，入夏以后，很多地区没有下过透雨。永兴县和平社，在抗旱当中，出动二百七十张水车，日夜英勇抗旱，用16—24梯水车引水翻山过坳，不但抢救了田禾，而且还创造了二百一十八亩千斤丰产亩。如果仍然是一家一户为一个生产单位的小农经济，那种灾害严重情况，是不可想像的。历史事实，也充分说明了那种可怕的现象。正是由于农业集体化的结果，有力地开展了艰苦的抗旱斗争，克服了自然灾害，避免或减轻了受灾程度。
    农民的生活
    确实改善了
    其次，关于农民生活，我也有所了解，我在郴县燕泉社，访问社员匡为恒，他去年一个人做了五套衣服——一套厂呢、一套卡机布、一套白竹布、两套青纲布。自然这是比较突出的，但一般来说，也都有了改善，如龙山县水沙乡，在去年遭受旱灾的情况下，还有三百五十八人做了五百五十件新衣服，七十人做了七十件新棉衣，六十户买了绒线，三十七户买了棉被。农民购买力确是一年一年在上升。据常德专区典型调查：平原地区沅江县调查四十个农户，去年三季度的购买力比前年同期提高71.2％；丘陵区的临澧县临安乡于丰农业社，去年全社总收入比前年增加77.5％。山区的慈利县沙坪社集体部分的购买力，去年第三季度比前年同期增加二点八五倍。当然，这不是说，今天农民的生活已经挺好了，已经不是没有困难了。事实说明，农民的生活，比土改前要好，比解放前更好；但距我们要求的理想还远，就是和今天城市生活比较，差别也很大。八大文件指出：“我们国内的主要矛盾，已经是人民对于建立先进的工业国的要求同落后的农业国的现实之间的矛盾，已经是人民对于经济文化迅速发展的需要同当前经济文化不能满足人民需要的状况之间的矛盾。这一矛盾的实质，在我国社会主义制度已经建立的情况下，也就是先进的社会主义制度，同落后的社会生产力之间的矛盾。党和全国人民的当前的主要任务，就是要集中力量来解决这个矛盾，把我国尽快地从落后的农业国变为先进的工业国。”因此，我们要紧接着合作化的高潮，掀起发展生产的高潮，积极进行技术改革的准备。全国人民，还要自觉的厉行增产节约，支援国家工农业的建设。同时，我们要把工农业建设投资的比例，计划得更相适应，把积累和分配的比例，安排得更加妥当。
    再次，我还看到：在农业走向高级形式合作化的今天，广大农村已经把“老有所终，幼有所长，鳏寡孤独废疾者皆有所养”的大同世界的崇高理想，变成了活生生的事实，对于年幼不能劳动乏人照顾或年老丧失劳动力的鳏寡孤独，都进行了“五保”；同时，对军烈属实行了优待劳动日，使他们得到了社会主义的温暖，亲身体验到农业合作化的好处。当我进行访问时，他们对共产党、人民政府和毛主席的伟大恩情，感激得热泪满眶，有的说：“爷亲娘亲，不如共产党和毛主席亲”。局部、暂时的缺点可以克服
    总之，农业合作化的好处是很多的，但是不是还有缺点呢？我前面已经提到，在大踏步前进中，的确曾经发生和存在一些问题。如像少数社有涣散或半涣散状态；个别社的生产，特别是副业生产，有自流情况；有些富裕户，想弃农就商，自发搞生意；以及部分社干部作风生硬，死搬硬套等等。但这是次要的、局部的、暂时的，可以克服的。并且从开展整社工作以来，已经或正在克服，而成绩是主要的，社会主义道路是走对了的。社会主义经济，不能建立在两种不同经济制度的基础上，只有农业走向集体化，才能配合社会主义工业化的要求，才能永远消灭农村中的资本主义，才能彻底消灭阶级，消灭剥削。这是本质问题。如果我们不明辨是非，把主要和次要、本质和非本质的问题混淆起来，这就不是马列主义的观点，是不合实际的看法，这对巩固和扩大社会主义胜利，是非常有害的。我认为在全国各个地区，各个阶层，普遍深入地进行社会主义思想的再教育，还是很必要的。
    我的发言，就此结束。末了，敬祝大会胜利，同志们健康！（附图片）
