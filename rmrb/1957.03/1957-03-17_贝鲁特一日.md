    One Day in Beirut
    By Our Correspondent Jiang Yuanchun

    The Lebanese press has two organizations: one belongs to the newspaper owners and is called the Press Syndicate, and the other belongs to the journalists and editors and is called the Journalists Association. The reason for this separation is that the interests of these two groups are always contradictory. The boss only cares about paying the money and deciding on the policy. If something goes wrong with the newspaper, he is not responsible; if someone is to be arrested or imprisoned, it falls on the so-called "responsible editor" he hires.

    After our arrival in Syria, some of the leaders of these two organizations, in their personal capacities, invited us to visit Lebanon. We also wanted to visit Beirut, so after our visit to Syria came to an end, five Chinese journalists went to Beirut.

    It only takes about two hours by car from Damascus to Beirut, but you have to cross a mountain that is more than 2,000 meters above sea level. Now it is winter, and the mountain is often either snowing or foggy. Because the mountain roads are steep, in such weather, it takes five or six hours, and sometimes it is simply impossible to pass. The day we went, the weather was very good. We originally planned to leave in the afternoon and arrive in Beirut in the evening, but as it turned out, we did not leave Damascus until after dark, because we could not find a business car to go to Beirut. The Syrian and Lebanese business car drivers boycott each other and do not allow business cars to travel to each other's countries. Anyone who travels is fined twenty-five Syrian pounds.

    Syria and Lebanon used to be one country, but were forcibly split into two countries by the imperialist policy of divide and rule. However, the two countries still have very close relations in all aspects. People from both countries can come and go at any time as long as they complete the formalities at the border. The currencies of the two countries can also be exchanged at any time in the market. However, the political development of the two countries has recently become more and more distant. Syria adheres to a policy of peace and neutrality and opposes colonialism, while the current government of Lebanon is inclined to the West, openly supports the Eisenhower Plan, and opposes peace and neutrality. Lebanon has also taken in some people who fled from Syria in connection with the recently discovered conspiracy case, and allows these people to carry out anti-Syrian activities in Lebanon. This has made the relationship between the two countries increasingly tense. The mutual boycott of business car workers is a manifestation of this tense relationship.

    Finally, we managed to get a car. It was already dark. That day was the fifteenth day of the first lunar month. We rode along the mountain road from east to west, bathed in the silvery light cast by the full moon. After about forty kilometers, we reached the Syrian-Lebanese border. After completing the entry and exit formalities at the two border stations in Syria and Lebanon, which were quite far apart, we drove towards Beirut. It is said that the scenery of Lebanon is very beautiful, but unfortunately it was not clear at night. However, the moonlight shone on the snow-covered mountain peaks, and the lights in the villages below the snow line had a special flavor. Following the winding mountain road, we crossed the north-south mountain range. There was snow on both sides of the road, and we felt a chill even sitting in the car. Although it was at night, there were still many vehicles coming and going, especially heavy trucks carrying more than five tons. This is because a large part of Syria's import and export goods rely on the port of Beirut for transit. This section of the highway in Lebanon, from the border to Beirut, is equipped with fluorescent signs along the road, which is very useful for night driving and is one of the best highways I have ever seen.

    After crossing the mountain, the car spiraled down, and Lebanese cedars, which are very famous, appeared along the road. You can see the appearance of this cedar on the Lebanese flag. Looking at Beirut from a distance, it looks like a lake woven from lights, or a large Damascus inlay made of gold dots. A line of lights stretches along the mountains on both sides of the road. This is a summer resort for the rich. But now it is winter, and it all looks desolate.

    Once you arrive in Beirut, you feel that the city is terribly chaotic. The streets are very narrow, the roadsides are full of parked cars, and the streets are full of cars. Living on the seventh floor of the hotel, the noise of the cars on the street below kept people awake all night. This "prosperous" scene, mainly composed of American cars, is caused by installment payment methods supported by foreign banks. No wonder some people say that you should not look at so many cars, in fact, the owner is not the person driving the car, but a foreign bank. As long as you cannot pay the installment payment once, the bank will take the car back.

    We stayed in the hotel overnight. The elevator boy in the hotel and the waiters in the dining room all speak English with an American accent and have an American style. "Good luck to you" is a polite greeting that is common everywhere here. The next morning, we started wandering around the city. Beirut faces the Mediterranean Sea on one side and is surrounded by mountains on three sides. The city itself is also high and low, undulating along the mountain. Compared with Damascus, Beirut seems very dirty, with garbage everywhere on the streets, as if it has not been cleaned for a long time. The streets are very narrow, and with so many cars, pedestrians seem particularly crowded and panicked. It is very difficult to cross the road. At the street corners, there are often groups of men in tattered clothes, who are said to be unemployed workers waiting to be temporarily hired. There are many children in their teens on the streets, holding stacks of government-issued lottery tickets, peddling them to passers-by, and even we foreigners have become the target of their pursuit. The shops look very tidy and have a lot of goods, but they are all foreign goods, especially American goods. There are also many goods from West Germany and Japan. The streets are full of advertisements for American goods, American movies, and signs for foreign agents and distributors.

    Beirut, like other cities in Arab countries, has a so-called bazaar (market), but it is smaller in scale and divided into two parts: one part sells goods for local people, and the other part sells goods for Europeans. There is a street that specializes in selling cheap food, and the stalls are crowded with customers. There are many vegetables and fruits. Fruits (oranges, tangerines, bananas, lemons) are a very important export commodity of Lebanon.

    At first glance, Beirut is completely a commercial city. Western countries deliberately want to develop Beirut in this direction, so that it can become a transit port for their economic aggression against Middle Eastern countries. It is said that foreign bank loans in industry are only 15 million Lebanese pounds (one pound is approximately equivalent to more than seven Chinese yuan according to the foreign exchange rate), while loans in commerce reach 340 million Lebanese pounds. As a result, Lebanon's national industry has been hit. The total output value of Lebanon's industry currently accounts for 18% of the total national income, while in 1947-1948, it had risen from 10% during the French rule to 24%. Lebanon's current industries are mainly cotton textile industry, olive oil, leather, etc. These industries are all subject to competition from foreign goods. It is said that since the invasion of Egypt, goods from Japan and Italy have become their strong rivals.

    Many foreign merchant ships are anchored in the port. Nearby is a road that looks a bit like the section of Nanjing Road in Shanghai near the Bund before liberation. This is Beirut's Wall Street, the place where foreign banks are concentrated. There are many foreign banks here, American and Belgian. But the strongest force is still French banks. The French-capital "Syrian Lebanese Bank" still controls the right to issue currency. The power plant and railway here are also owned by French capital.

    After we finished shopping, we met with several leaders of the Press Syndicate who invited us in a friendly atmosphere, and then we were invited to meet with the Director of the Lebanese Government Information Bureau. Mr. Said, the Director of the Information Bureau, then invited us upstairs to meet with Prime Minister Solh. Although we were just a few journalists in the capacity of tourists, we could not refuse the hospitality, so we went. Solh is in his fifties, with a medium build and a plump figure. He talked to us from the patriotic spirit in the music of the Chinese Art Troupe last year, all the way to the meeting with Premier Zhou Enlai at the Asian-African Conference. The whole atmosphere was friendly. Solh is a Muslim. Since two-thirds of the population of Lebanon are Christians (mainly Maronites) and one-third are Muslims, according to tradition, the president is always a Christian and the prime minister is always a Muslim. Politically speaking, as a result of imperialist activities, most Christians are pro-Western, while most Muslims are nationalists who are pro-Arab countries. The struggle between the two groups is very sharp. In fact, this is a question of whether Lebanon should take the road of peace and neutrality. On this day in Beirut, Lebanese President Chamoun announced that Lebanon could not be neutral and must lean towards the West. It is said that recently delegations from all over the country have been coming to Beirut every day to visit Prime Minister Solh, demanding that the government change its pro-Western policy. It seems that it is not so easy for the current Lebanese government to completely lean towards the West.

    After we came out of Prime Minister Solh's office, we sat in the Director of the Information Bureau's office for a while. The owner of a newspaper was arguing loudly there. After he met us, he said bitterly: "You came just in time. The day you came is the day my newspaper was banned. Look, this is our democracy!" It turned out that his newspaper was banned by the government because it published an article against the Eisenhower Plan.

    The Director of the Information Bureau said it wonderfully. He said to us, "You see, we are very democratic here. He can come here and argue loudly like this." After listening to these two diametrically opposed explanations of democracy, we had to laugh and remain silent.

    After leaving the Prime Minister's Office, we visited the Journalists Association and were invited to a purely Arabic-style meal. After eating and drinking to our fill, we had a warm and frank conversation. It seems that the relationship between Lebanese journalists of different tendencies is not bad. They teased each other, joked, and had everything. Both right-wing and left-wing journalists were quite friendly to us Chinese journalists.

    A car carried us through the alley-like streets for a final cursory look at Beirut. We passed the famous American University. The high wall enclosed a large area on the seaside. The surrounding area is full of American residences. Buildings with completely American sentiments, colors, and layouts are being built one after another on the best part of the seaside. And below them on the seaside is the cliff where people who are too poor to live often commit suicide. Compared with the American University, Lebanon's own university is simply a joke. This university has been running for eight years, and now it only has a teachers college. Our car drove into the school gate as if it were in an uninhabited area. The two small buildings on the left and right sides of the school gate are the offices of the Ministry of Education, and in the center is a theater run by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The only building belonging to the university is a small building squeezed to one side. In a few minutes, we circled around inside and drove out of the school gate.

    It was already dark when we left Beirut. There was fog on the mountain, and it had just snowed a little in some places. Two hours later, we returned to Syrian territory. The fluorescent signs that shone brightly under the headlights along the road disappeared after crossing the border between the two countries. However, we did not feel the slightest regret about the lack of this modern equipment on this section of the highway in Syria. A cold moon shone on the quiet valleys and fields of Syria. Sitting in the car speeding eastward, we all had a feeling of returning to our own home. After spending a day in Beirut in a hurry, Syria became more and more dear and lovely to us.

### 贝鲁特一日

    贝鲁特一日
    本报记者　蒋元椿
    黎巴嫩新闻界有两个组织，一个是属于报纸老板的，叫做新闻同业公会，另一个是属于记者编辑的，叫做新闻记者协会。之所以要这样分开，是因为这两类人的利益总是互相矛盾的。老板只顾出钱，决定政策。报纸出了事情，他是不负责任的，要抓要关，都落在他雇用的一位所谓“负责编辑”身上。
    我们到了叙利亚以后，这两个组织的一些负责人，就以个人名义邀请我们去黎巴嫩访问。正好我们也想去贝鲁特玩玩，于是等在叙利亚访问告一段落，我们五名中国记者就到贝鲁特去了。
    从大马士革到贝鲁特，坐汽车只要两个多钟头。不过中间要翻过一座拔海两千多公尺的大山。现在正是冬季，山上经常不是下雪，就是有雾。因为山路险峻，遇到这种天气，那就得花上五、六个小时，有时还根本通不过。我们去的那天，天气很好。我们原定在下午动身，傍晚到贝鲁特，可是结果一直等到天黑以后才从大马士革出发，原因是找不到去贝鲁特的出差汽车，因为叙利亚和黎巴嫩的出差汽车司机互相抵制，不许出差汽车互相来往。谁要来往，就要罚款二十五叙镑。
    叙利亚和黎巴嫩在从前本来是一个国家，后来被帝国主义用分而治之的政策硬拆成两个国家，可是两国之间在各方面都仍然有着非常密切的关系。两国人民互相来往，只要在边境上办个手续，随时都可以通过。两国货币在市场上也可以随时互相兑换。但是两国政治上的发展，近来却越离越远。叙利亚坚持和平中立政策，反对殖民主义，黎巴嫩现在的政府却倾向西方，公开赞成艾森豪威尔计划，反对和平中立。黎巴嫩还收容了从叙利亚逃出去的同最近发现的阴谋案有关的一些人，容许这些人在黎巴嫩进行反叙利亚的活动。这就使得两国关系日益紧张。出差汽车工人的互相抵制，就是这种紧张关系的一种表现。
    最后，我们终于弄到了一辆汽车。天色已黑。那天是阴历正月十五，我们乘着一轮满月所倾泻的遍地银光，沿着山间公路，由东向西疾驰。大约四十公里之后，就到了叙、黎边境。在叙利亚和黎巴嫩两个相距颇远的边境站上办了出入境手续，我们就向贝鲁特驰去。据说黎巴嫩风景很美，可惜夜间看不清楚。不过，月光照着积雪皑皑的山头，雪线下面一片一片村庄里的灯光，看来也别有一番风味。循着盘绕曲折的公路翻过南北纵行的大山，山上道路两旁都是雪，坐在车子里面都觉得一阵阵的冷。虽然是在夜间，来往的车辆却仍然很多，特别是载重五吨以上的大货车。因为叙利亚的进出口货物，有很大一部分是依靠贝鲁特这个港口转口的。黎巴嫩境内这段公路，从边境一直到贝鲁特，沿路都设有萤光标志，对于夜间行车，非常有用，是我所曾经见过的最好的公路之一。
    翻过大山，汽车盘旋下降，路旁出现了黎巴嫩非常有名的杉树。这种杉树的样子，你在黎巴嫩的国旗上就可以看到。远望贝鲁特，像是由一片灯光所织成的一个湖，又像是一个用金点子做成的大马士革的镶嵌细工。公路两边的山头上，迤逦着一线灯光。这是有钱人的夏天避暑之地。不过现在正是冬季，都显得冷落了。
    一到贝鲁特，你就觉得这个城市乱得要命。街道很窄，路边上停满了汽车，街上汽车乱窜。住在旅馆的七层楼上，下面街上的汽车声整夜闹得人不能睡觉。这种主要由美国汽车构成的“繁荣”景象，是由外国银行支持的分期付款的办法造成的。无怪乎有人说，你别看这么多汽车，实际上主人并不是开车子的人，而是外国银行。只要你一次付不出分期付的款，银行就把汽车收回了。
    在旅馆里住了一夜。旅馆里开电梯的小孩，饭厅里的侍者，都讲的一口美国腔的英语，一副美国派头。“祝您走运”，是这里到处通行的客气话。第二天一早，我们就开始在这个城市里蹓跶。贝鲁特一面靠地中海，三面环着山。城市本身也是高高低低，依山势起伏。同大马士革比起来，贝鲁特就显得很脏，街上到处都是垃圾，好像很久没有打扫了似的。街道都很窄，加上汽车多，行人就显得特别挤，特别慌乱。穿过马路很不容易。街角上常常站着一群群穿着破旧衣服的男子，据说这是等候被人临时雇用的失业工人。街上有许多十来岁的小孩子，手里拿着一叠政府发行的彩票，向路人兜售，连我们这些外国人也成为他们追逐的对象。商店看来都很整齐，货品也多，可是都是外国货，特别是美国货。西德和日本的货色也不少。街上到处是美国货、美国电影的广告，和外国代理商、经销商的招牌。
    贝鲁特也像其他阿拉伯国家的城市一样，有一个所谓巴札尔（市场），不过规模比较小，而且分成两部分，一部分是卖本地人用品的，一部分是卖欧洲人的用品的。有一条街是专卖廉价的吃食品的，摊上挤满了顾客。蔬菜和水果不少。水果（柑、桔、香蕉、柠檬）是黎巴嫩很重要的出口货。
    贝鲁特一眼看去，完全是一个商业城市。西方国家有意使贝鲁特向这个方向发展，以便使它成为它们向中东国家进行经济侵略的一个转口港。据说，外国银行在工业方面的贷款，不过一千五百万黎巴嫩镑（一镑照外汇折合约合中国七毛多一点），而在商业方面的贷款，却达三亿四千万黎镑。其结果，就是黎巴嫩的民族工业受到了打击。黎巴嫩的工业总产值在全部国民收入中目前占18％，而在1947—1948年的时候，它曾经由法国统治时期的10％上升到了24％。黎巴嫩目前所有的工业主要是棉纺织业、橄榄油、皮革等。这些工业都受到了外国商品的竞争。据说，从侵埃战争发生以来，日本和意大利的商品已经成为它们的劲敌。
    港口里碇泊着许多外国商船。附近有一条马路，样子有点像解放以前上海南京路靠近外滩这一段。这是贝鲁特的华尔街，外国银行集中的处所。这里外国银行不少，美国的、比利时的都有。而力量最强的还是法国银行。法国资本的“叙利亚黎巴嫩银行”现在仍然掌握着通货发行权。这里的发电厂和铁路，也是归法国资本所有的。
    我们逛完了街，同邀请我们的新闻同业公会的几位领导人在友好的气氛中见了面，接着就被邀去见黎巴嫩政府的新闻局长。新闻局长萨伊德先生又请我们上楼去见总理索勒哈先生。虽然我们不过是几名游客身份的记者，可是盛情难却，我们也就去了。索勒哈五十多岁，中等的胖胖身材。他同我们从去年中国艺术团的音乐中的爱国主义精神谈起，一直谈到在亚非会议上同周恩来总理的会见，整个气氛是友好的。索勒哈是伊斯兰教徒。由于黎巴嫩人口中三分之二是基督教徒（主要是马龙派），三分之一是伊斯兰教徒，因此按照传统，总统总是由基督教徒充当，而总理总是伊斯兰教徒。从政治上来说，由于帝国主义活动的结果，基督教徒多数亲西方，而伊斯兰教徒多数是亲阿拉伯国家的民族主义者。两个集团之间的斗争是很尖锐的。实际上，这是黎巴嫩要不要走和平中立道路的问题。我们在贝鲁特这一天，黎巴嫩总统夏蒙宣布黎巴嫩不能中立，必须倾向西方。据说，最近从全国各地每天有代表团到贝鲁特来访问总理索勒哈，要求政府改变亲西方的政策。看来，黎巴嫩现政府要完全倒向西方，也不是那么容易的事。
    我们从索勒哈总理那里出来，在新闻局长的办公室里又坐了一忽儿。一家报纸的老板正在那里大吵大闹。他同我们见过面以后，恨恨地说：“你们来得正好。你们来的日子，就是我的报纸被查封的日子。你们看看，这就是我们的民主！”原来他的报纸因为登了一篇反对艾森豪威尔计划的文章，所以被政府查封了。
    新闻局长倒也说得妙。他对我们说，“你们看，我们这里是很民主的。他可以到我这里来这样大吵大闹。”听了这两种针锋相对的关于民主的解释以后，我们只好笑而不言了。
    从总理府出来，我们访问了新闻记者协会，并且被邀吃了一顿纯粹是阿拉伯风味的饭。酒醉饭饱之后，又进行了一番热烈坦率的谈话。看来，在不同倾向的黎巴嫩记者之间，关系倒是不坏的。他们互相取笑，插科打诨，应有尽有。对我们这些中国记者，无论是右翼和左翼的记者，都是相当友好的。
    一辆汽车载着我们，穿过胡同式的街巷对贝鲁特作最后一次走马看花。我们经过有名的美国大学。高高的围墙圈去了海边上很大一块地方。附近一带，都是美国人的住宅。完全是美国情调、色彩、格局的建筑，正在海边上最好的地方一幢接一幢地建筑起来。而在它们下面海边上，就是穷得活不下去的人经常在那里跳海自杀的悬崖。同美国大学比起来，黎巴嫩自己的一所大学就简直像是开玩笑。这所大学办了已经八年，现在还只有一个师范学院。我们的汽车如入无人之境地开进了校门，校门左右两旁两幢小楼是教育部的办公室，正中是联合国教育、科学、文化组织办的一所剧院。属于大学的只是蹩在一边的一幢小楼。几分钟功夫，我们就在里面兜完圈子，开出了校门。
    离开贝鲁特的时候，天已经黑了。山上有雾，有的地方刚下过一阵小雪。两个多钟头以后，我们就回到了叙利亚境内。沿路在车灯照射下闪闪发光的萤光标志，在过了两国交界处以后就没有了。不过，我们对于叙利亚境内这段公路没有这种近代设备丝毫不觉得遗憾。一轮寒月照耀着叙利亚的幽静的山谷和原野。坐在向东疾驰的汽车里，我们都有一种回到了自己的家的感觉。在贝鲁特匆匆过了一天以后，叙利亚对于我们变得更加可亲可爱了。（附图片）
