Implement the Spirit of Thrift and Do a Good Job in Preschool Education
Guan Ruiwu's Speech

I am engaged in preschool education. Now, I would like to talk about preschool education, guided by Chairman Mao's instructions that we should attach importance to the education of the younger generation and pay attention to implementing the spirit of thrift.

Since the founding of New China, with the development of socialist construction and the care of the Party and the government for children, the number of kindergartens has increased dramatically. In 1956 alone, the central Ministry of Education estimated that there were only 7,129 kindergartens with 561,594 children in the first half of the year; the estimates for the second half of the year showed that there were 14,000 kindergartens in 19 regions across the country, with more than 840,000 children. Therefore, how to ensure that these kindergartens can both implement the spirit of thrift and take care of children's education is an urgent issue that needs attention. Some people say, "Currently, the main focus is on thrift, and there is no time to take care of children's education." I think this view is inappropriate. Because the fact that more than 840,000 children are in kindergartens is an objective reality. If education is not emphasized during this period, it will be difficult to reform them when they enter elementary school. Everyone is currently concerned about the moral education of elementary school students, how can we ignore the education before entering elementary school!

At present, there are problems in various types of kindergartens in implementing thrift while taking care of children's education. First, from the kindergartens run by institutions, enterprises, factories, mines, and the military: some kindergartens often pursue formalism in architectural equipment, and the staffing of general affairs and administrative personnel is huge, resulting in waste of human and material resources. Now, in order to implement the spirit of thrift, these kindergartens have been changed to enterprise management, and most of the expenses are to be borne by the children's parents. General cadres are afraid of not being able to afford this expense and have begun to let their children drop out of school, so that kindergartens have become only serving the children of a few cadres with relatively superior economic conditions, and cannot play a role in serving the broad masses of the people. On the other hand, in terms of children's education, although the current lack of teachers cannot be demanded too high, judging from the fact that some kindergartens only pay too much attention to architectural equipment, it has already had a bad influence on children. It makes children's lives divorced from the actual level of our society, makes children become flowers in a greenhouse, and cannot establish the habit of hard work and simplicity from an early age. I heard that some kindergarten children have said such things: "These clothes are worn by ordinary people, we don't wear them." Obviously, this is because the kindergarten is too particular, and usually there is no correct education for children, which cultivates a special sense of looking down on ordinary people in the children's hearts. It can be seen how serious the consequences will be if only focusing on material enjoyment without understanding education. Second, from the perspective of private kindergartens: the number of private kindergartens is developing rapidly. They can implement the spirit of thrift, but due to the limitations of human and material resources, they also need the help of educational administrative departments to master the knowledge of educating children.

Tap Potential and Cultivate Preschool Education Talents

Under the current conditions in our country, can these kindergartens implement the spirit of thrift on the one hand, and take care of children's education on the other? I think it is entirely possible. The most important key lies in tapping the potential of existing preschool educators and enabling them to cultivate preschool education talents. This can be done in the following two aspects:

	(1) Give full play to the strength of the preschool education majors in existing higher normal schools: Our government attaches importance to preschool education. From 1950 to 1956, two Soviet experts were invited to Beijing Normal University to teach advanced Soviet preschool education theories and methods; at the same time, students were also sent to the Soviet Union to study preschool education. Recently, a student who studied abroad has returned to China and is working as a teaching assistant at Beijing Normal University. Currently, Beijing Normal University and Nanjing, Northwest, and Southwest three normal colleges have established preschool education majors. They use advanced Soviet theories combined with China's reality to train a group of teachers. The strength of these teachers can be used to do the following two tasks: First, train teachers for preschool normal schools, so that the preschool normal schools in various places can be enriched and train more kindergarten teachers. Second, run short-term training courses to train preschool education cadres in various places. After a year of study, they will return to their original regions to promote preschool education work. Beijing Normal University has run three such training courses, and the cadres who have been trained have been distributed to various regions across the country to be responsible for preschool education work. For example, Sichuan Province has achieved great results by organizing provincial preschool education training courses by cadres who have received such training. I think this is a good method that is both economical and can enable more cadres to master preschool education.

	(2) Give full play to the strength of preschool normal schools in various places: The development of preschool normal schools across the country is very rapid. There were only nine in 1955, and now there are nineteen. In addition, there are many preschool normal classes attached to ordinary normal schools. These institutions should not only train qualified kindergarten teachers, but also exert more efforts to improve the business of kindergartens in the region. For example, teachers from the Shanghai Preschool Normal School are responsible for lecturing to kindergarten teachers in Shanghai. At the same time, kindergarten teachers who have attended the lectures can also drive private kindergartens. This method of promoting layer by layer is both economical and can gradually improve preschool education.

However, I would like to remind comrades that the two forces mentioned above have not been fully utilized at present, because: (1) Preschool normal schools lack teachers. Recently, I visited Wuhan, Changsha, Guangzhou, and Shanghai to inspect preschool education and found that there were only 29 teachers who had received professional training in preschool education. Among these 29, Shanghai Preschool Normal School accounted for 14 of the 24 classes, and the other three regions with 83 classes had only 15 professional teachers. They were too busy to take care of themselves, and it was impossible to ask them to take care of promoting preschool education in the region. (2) Enrollment quotas for higher normal schools are restricted. The Ministry of Education believes that preschool education is not developing, and local preschool teachers do not need people, so the enrollment quotas for preschool majors are severely restricted, and they do not agree to run short-term training courses. As a result, higher normal schools with sufficient manpower cannot exert their strength even if they have teachers.

Improve the Leadership of Preschool Education Work and Attach Importance to Preschool Education Work

The reason for this situation is that the institutions leading preschool education work are not connected and do not pay enough attention to preschool education:

	(1) The Ministry of Education's leadership of preschool education is too detailed: Within the Ministry of Education, there is the Preschool Education Department in charge of kindergartens across the country; the Secondary Normal School Department in charge of preschool normal schools that train kindergarten teachers; the Higher Normal School Department in charge of various higher normal schools and determines the enrollment plan for preschool majors; and the Planning and Statistics Section in charge of the number of preschool education in various places. The connection between these agencies is not enough, resulting in a disconnection phenomenon, and it is not easy to make a realistic talent training plan. Therefore, the talents trained by higher normal schools are too few to meet the needs of the development of preschool normal schools.

	(2) Personnel departments do not understand preschool education: In the past few years, graduates of preschool majors in higher normal schools have been assigned to work as teachers in kindergartens, and some have even changed careers. This situation has improved in the past two years, but those who have already changed careers have not returned to the team. Originally, graduates of higher normal schools could train more teachers, but restricting them to be teachers can only play a role in one class or one kindergarten, which is essentially a waste of talent.

	(3) Education departments and education bureaus in various places do not pay enough attention to preschool education. The specific situation is: (1) Some provinces have hundreds of kindergartens, but the education department does not have a full-time cadre to lead preschool education work. (2) Some regions have preschool education cadres, but the number is very small, often one cadre manages one or two hundred kindergartens, and these cadres are often transferred to do other work. For example, preschool education cadres in Guangzhou City have been transferred to work on intellectual investigation, export commodity exhibitions, drought relief propaganda, and reception of foreign guests within a year. Therefore, it is impossible to go deep into the work, and the leadership of kindergartens in institutions, the military, private kindergartens, etc., has to be relaxed.
(3) They do not understand preschool normal education and believe that they can teach without professional knowledge. These education bureaus and education departments do not have an in-depth understanding of preschool education, so the information they reflect to the Ministry of Education is not comprehensive enough, and the Ministry of Education cannot make a realistic plan. For example, the Preschool Education Department said that attention should be paid to training teachers, and other institutions of the Ministry of Education said, "Education departments in various places do not need teachers for preschool education, and they cannot be assigned if they are trained too much."

I believe that our government attaches great importance to the link of preschool education, especially the work of cultivating talents. The phenomenon of disconnection in these tasks can be overcome without the government increasing economic burden. I hope the Ministry of Education will consider the following issues:

	(1) Unify the institutions leading preschool education within the Ministry of Education to avoid disconnection.

	(2) Conduct a thorough investigation of the number of teachers needed by preschool normal schools (including preschool normal classes in ordinary normal schools) across the country, determine the plan for higher normal schools to train teachers, and give full play to existing human resources.

	(3) In qualified higher normal schools, hold short-term training courses for in-service preschool education cadres, transfer preschool education cadres from education departments and bureaus in various places for training, and cultivate their ability to lead and promote preschool education in various places.

	(4) Instruct education departments and bureaus in various places to strengthen the leadership of kindergartens in institutions, the military, enterprises, factories, mines, and private kindergartens, and help them improve their business, so that they can implement the principle of thrift in their work and provide children with reasonable education.

Finally, I hope everyone will pay attention to the issue of preschool education. At present, preschool normal schools have difficulty in enrolling students. Parents are unwilling to let their daughters take the preschool normal school exam, thinking that it is useless to learn to take care of children in high school. Some people in society do not pay enough attention to the labor of kindergarten teachers. When they see teachers taking children for a walk on the street, they ask, "How much do you get paid a month to take care of the children so well?" Guangzhou Preschool Normal School also found that their students' admission certificates were attached with a note: "This student is poor and can take the preschool normal school exam"; or "This student's grades are not good and can take the preschool normal school exam." Society does not pay such attention to preschool education, so students in preschool normal schools generally have the idea of ​​not loving their major, and the phenomenon of dropping out is very serious. We must all pay attention to this issue, otherwise kindergartens will lack trained teachers. The development of the number of kindergartens is so rapid. It is estimated that a large number of children will enter elementary school from kindergartens every year. If they do not receive correct education in kindergartens, it will bring many difficulties to elementary schools. The "Storms in Ma Yue's Growth" published in China Youth Magazine recently is a clear example. I hope the Youth League and the Women's Federation will encourage young people to participate in this glorious work of cultivating the next generation. I hope all the members will pay attention to the issue of preschool education, and when visiting various places, also care about preschool education, and give support and encouragement to preschool educators, so that the next generation of our motherland can lay a good foundation for physical strength, intelligence, and moral character from an early age.

    贯彻节约精神　做好幼儿教育工作
    关瑞梧的发言
    我是从事幼儿教育工作的，现在我愿意本着毛主席指示我们重视对青年一代进行教育和注意贯彻节约的精神，来谈一下幼儿教育的问题。
    自从新中国成立以来，随着社会主义建设发展的需要，在党和政府对儿童的关怀下，幼儿园数量的增长，是突飞猛进的。以1956年一年来说，中央教育部上半年的估计只有七千一百二十九个幼儿园，在园儿童是五十六万一千五百九十四人；下半年的估计，全国十九个地区就有一万四千所幼儿园，在园儿童有八十四万多人。因此，怎样使这些幼儿园既能贯彻节约的精神又能照顾到儿童的教育，是当前迫切需要注意的问题。有些人说：“目前主要是节约，来不及照顾幼儿教育”。我认为这看法是不恰当的。因为八十四万多的儿童在幼儿园是客观存在的事实，如果这个时期不重视教育，到入小学再改造就很困难了。目前大家都很关心小学生的道德品质教育，又岂能忽视入小学前一阶段的教育呢！
    目前各种类型的幼儿园，在贯彻节约同时兼顾儿童教育方面是存在问题的。第一，从机关、企业、厂矿、部队办理的幼儿园来看：其中有些幼儿园往往在建筑设备上过于追求形式，总务行政人员的编制庞大，造成人力物力上的浪费。现在，为了贯彻节约的精神，这些幼儿园改为企业化，大部费用要由儿童的家长来负担，一般的干部怕担负不了这笔费用开始纷纷让子女退学，这样幼儿园就变成了只为少数经济条件比较优裕的干部的子女服务，不能发挥为广大群众服务的作用。另一面在儿童教育方面，虽然目前师资缺乏，不能要求太高，但是某些幼儿园只从建筑设备过于讲究这点来看，已经给儿童不好的影响，它使儿童的生活脱离我们社会实际的水平，使儿童成为暖房的花朵，从小就不能建立起艰苦朴素的习惯。我听说，有个别幼儿园的儿童曾说过这样的话：“这种衣服是老百姓穿的，我们不穿”。显然，这是由于幼儿园太讲究了，平时对儿童又没有正确教育，在儿童心中养成一种看不起老百姓的特殊感。可见只重物质享受不懂得教育，是会造成多么严重的后果。第二，从民办幼儿园来看：目前民办幼儿园的数量，发展很快。它们能够贯彻节约的精神，但是由于人力物力的限制，还需要教育行政部门帮助它们掌握教育儿童的知识。
    发挥潜力，培养幼儿教育人才
    在目前我国的条件下，能不能使这些幼儿园一方面贯彻节约的精神，同时又照顾到儿童的教育呢？我认为完全可能。最主要的关键在于发挥现有幼儿教育工作者的潜力，让他们能够培养幼儿教育工作的人才。可以从下列两方面进行：
      （1）充分发挥现有高等师范学校的学龄前教育专业的力量：我们政府对幼儿教育是重视的。从1950年起到1956年，就先后请来了两位苏联专家在北京师范大学讲授苏联先进的学龄前教育理论和方法；同时也曾派遣了留学生到苏联学习学龄前教育。最近已经有一位留学生回国在北京师范大学作助教。现在全国有北京师范大学和南京、西北、西南三个师范学院设立了学龄前教育专业，它们运用着苏联的先进理论结合中国的实际，培养了一批教师。可以发挥这批教师的力量做以下两种工作：第一，培养幼儿师范学校的师资，使各地的幼儿师范学校充实起来，训练出更多的幼儿园教养员。第二，办理短期训练班，调训各地在职的幼儿教育干部，经过一年的学习，回到原地区推进幼儿教育工作。北京师范大学曾经办过三期这种训练班，受过训练的干部都已分布在全国各地区负责幼儿教育工作。例如四川省，曾由这种受过训练的干部组织全省幼儿教育工作训练班，有很大的成绩。我认为这是既经济而又能使更多干部掌握幼儿教育的好方法。
      （2）发挥各地幼儿师范学校的力量：全国的幼儿师范学校发展很快，1955年才有九所，现在已有十九所，此外还有许多附设在普通师范学校的幼儿师范班。这些机构不但要训练出合格的幼儿园教养员，而且可以发挥更多的力量负责提高所在地区的幼儿园的业务。例如上海市幼儿师范学校的教师，就负责给上海市教养员讲课。同时听过课的幼儿园教养员又可以带动民办幼儿园。这样层层推动的办法，是既经济又能逐步改进幼儿教育的。
    但是，我愿意提请同志们注意的是：上面说的两种力量在目前还没有得到充分发挥，原因是：（一）幼儿师范缺乏师资。最近我曾到武汉、长沙、广州、上海四个城市视察幼儿教育，发现这只有二十九名受过幼儿教育专业训练的教师，而这二十九名中，上海幼儿师范学校二十四个班就占了十四名，其他三个地区八十三个班仅有十五名专业教师，她们是自顾不暇，更不可能要求她们再兼顾推动所在地区的幼儿教育工作。（二）高等师范学校招生名额受到限制。教育部认为幼儿教育不发展，各地幼师不需要人，因此对学前专业招生名额限制很严，并且不同意办理短期训练班。结果，那些具备充裕人力的高等师范学校，虽有教师也不能发挥力量。
    改进对幼儿教育工作的领导，重视幼儿教育工作
    造成这种情况的原因，是由于领导幼儿教育工作的机构不相衔接，对幼儿教育重视不够：
      （1）教育部领导幼儿教育的机构分工过细：在教育部内，有幼教处管全国的幼儿园；中师司管培养幼儿园教养员的幼儿师范学校；高师司管各高等师范学校，确定学前专业的招生计划；计划统计科掌握各地幼儿教育的数字。这几个机构衔接不够，造成脱节现象，不容易做出切合实际的培养人才计划。因此高等师范学校培养的人才太少，不能满足幼儿师范学校发展的需要。
      （2）人事部门不了解幼儿教育：过去几年高等师范学校学龄前专业的毕业生被分配到幼儿园作教养员，有的甚至改了行。这种情况在最近两年已有改进，但是已经改行的还没归队。本来高等师范学校毕业生是可以训练更多教养员的，把她拘限为教养员，就只能在一班或一个幼儿园发挥作用，实质上就是人才的浪费。
      （3）各地教育厅、教育局对幼儿教育重视不够，具体的情况是：（一）有些省有几百所幼儿园，但是教育厅没有一个专职干部领导幼儿教育工作。（二）有些地区有幼儿教育干部，但人数很少，往往是一个干部管一、二百所幼儿园，并且常常调动这些干部做其他工作。例如，广州市的幼教干部，一年内被调作知识分子调查、出口商品展览、抗旱宣传、招待外宾等等工作。因此不可能深入工作，对机关、部队、民办等等幼儿园，只好放松领导。
  （三）不了解幼儿师范教育，认为没有专业知识也能够教。这些教育局和教育厅对幼儿教育了解不深入，因而向教育部反映的情况就不够全面，使教育部做不出符合实际的计划。例如幼教处说应当注意培养师资，教育部的其他机构说“各地教育厅不要幼儿教育的师资，训练多了分配不下去”。
    我认为我们政府是十分重视幼儿教育这一环节的，尤其注意培养人才的工作。这些工作中脱节的现象，是不需要政府增加经济上的负担就可以克服的。我希望教育部考虑以下几个问题：
      （1）将教育部内领导幼儿教育的机构统一起来，以免互不衔接，造成脱节。
      （2）切实调查现在全国幼儿师范学校（包括普通师范的幼师班）需要师资的数量，确定高等师范学校培养师资的计划，充分发挥现有的人力。
      （3）在有条件的高等师范学校，举办在职幼儿教育干部的短期专修班，调训各地教育厅、局的幼儿教育干部，培养她们领导推进各地幼儿教育事业的能力。
      （4）指示各地教育厅、局加强对机关、部队、企业、厂矿民办幼儿园的领导，帮助它们改进业务，使它们在工作上能贯彻节约原则，同时能给儿童合理的教育。
    最后，我希望大家重视幼儿教育这个问题。目前幼儿师范学校招生困难，父母不愿意自己的女儿考幼儿师范，认为到了高中还学看孩子没出息。社会上一些人对幼儿园教养员的劳动，也不够重视。他们看见教养员带孩子在街上散步就问：“你们一个月拿多少钱，把孩子带得这么好？”广州幼儿师范学校还发现它们学生的入学证件上附注着：“此生家贫可以考幼师”；或是“此生成绩不好，可以考幼师”。社会上对幼儿教育是这样的不重视，因此幼师的学生普遍存在着不热爱专业的思想，退学的现象很严重。我们大家必须重视这个问题，否则幼儿园就会缺乏有训练的师资。幼儿园数量的发展是那么迅速，估计每年会有大量儿童从幼儿园进入小学，如果在幼儿园他们得不到正确的教育，那就会给小学带来许多困难的。最近中国青年杂志登载的“马越成长中的风波”，就是一个明显的例子。我希望青年团和妇联鼓励青年们参加这项培养下一代的光荣工作。我希望各位委员都重视幼儿教育的问题，到各地视察的时候，也关心一下幼儿教育，给幼儿教育工作者支持鼓励，使我们祖国的下一代从很小就打下体力、智力和道德品质的良好基础。
