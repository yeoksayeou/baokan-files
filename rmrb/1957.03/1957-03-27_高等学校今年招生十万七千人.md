Xinhua News Agency, March 26th - The Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education recently studied and arranged the national university and college enrollment work for this year. This year, the nation's universities and colleges are initially set to enroll 107,000 students.

　　Most universities and colleges will continue to implement the national unified enrollment method this year; schools that have already implemented independent enrollment will continue to do so; individual schools with relatively adequate conditions and willing to conduct joint or independent enrollment can do so upon approval.

　　In order to further accommodate candidates' preferences for higher education, the allocation of new students according to a plan will generally not be adopted this year. Schools that cannot fill their quotas according to the candidates' stated preferences will adopt measures such as soliciting candidates' preferences or holding another enrollment examination to complete the enrollment task. Considering that the previous method of filling in engineering specialties by professional category was too general and difficult to reflect the candidates' true preferences, candidates can directly fill in their department or specialty preferences this year.

　　Workers, peasants, graduates of worker-peasant short-course middle schools, worker-peasant cadres, demobilized construction soldiers, transferred soldiers, on-the-job personnel who have participated in revolutionary work for more than three years, children of revolutionary martyrs, minority students, overseas Chinese students, and students from Hong Kong and Macau who apply to universities and colleges will be given priority in admission when their academic examination scores are the same as those of general candidates.

　　Regarding the question-setting work for university and college enrollment, this year, efforts will be made to ensure that the content of the test questions is correct and the workload is appropriate. In addition to establishing a question-setting committee, experts will be invited to review the test questions for each subject.

　　The Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education require local educational administrative departments and relevant universities and colleges to attach importance to this year's enrollment work, promptly assign cadres to establish enrollment agencies, and deploy this work.

　　高等学校今年招生十万七千人
    据新华社26日讯　高等教育部、教育部最近研究和部署了今年全国高等学校招生工作。今年全国高等学校初步确定招生十万七千人。
    多数高等学校今年将仍然实行全国统一招生的办法；过去已经实行单独招生的学校继续单独招生；个别条件比较具备而且愿意联合或单独招生的学校，经过批准，可以实行联合或单独招生。
    为了进一步照顾考生的升学志愿，今年录取新生一般不采取计划分配的办法。按照考生所填的志愿，不能录取满额的学校，将采取向考生征求志愿或再举行一次招生考试的办法来完成招生任务。考虑到以往规定工科按专业类填写志愿的办法过于笼统，难以体现出考生的真实志愿，因此今年考生可以直接选填系科或专业志愿。
    对于报考高等学校的工人、农民、工农速成中学今年毕业生、工农干部、复员建设军人、转业军人、参加革命工作满三年的在职人员、革命烈士子女、少数民族学生、华侨学生、香港澳门学生等，当他们的学科考试成绩和一般考生相同时，将予以优先录取。
    关于高等学校招生的命题工作，今年将力求试题内容正确，分量适当。除成立命题委员会外，还将聘请专家负责审查各科试题。
    高等教育部、教育部要求各地教育行政部门和有关的高等学校重视今年的招生工作，及时抽调干部建立招生机构和部署这项工作。
