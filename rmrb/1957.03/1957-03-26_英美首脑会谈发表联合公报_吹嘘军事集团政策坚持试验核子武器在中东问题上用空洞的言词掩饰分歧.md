Xinhua News Agency, March 25th, Bermuda dispatch: The Anglo-American summit concluded on March 24th after three days of meetings, and a final communiqué was issued.

　　The first part of the communiqué is a so-called declaration of principles. It states that the two countries will "coordinate" their foreign policies and expresses "great satisfaction" with the outcome of the meeting.

　　The second part of the communiqué lists the agreements reached by the two countries at this meeting.

　　In this part, the two countries reaffirmed their military bloc policy and reiterated the particular importance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization "as the cornerstone of the two countries' Western policy."

　　On the European issue, the two countries reiterated their intention to develop the European "unity" movement within the Atlantic bloc; agreed that Britain should establish closer ties with Europe; and believed that European and capitalist world trade could benefit from the European "Common Market" and "Free Trade Area" plans, but opposed the development of these two plans into establishing high tariff groups, and called on countries to adopt a "free" trade policy.

　　On the Middle East issue, the communiqué recorded the decision of the United States to participate in the Baghdad Pact military committee.

　　The communiqué also stated that the two countries agreed that "it is necessary to promptly implement the recent United Nations General Assembly resolutions on the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba." This resolution requires that after Israel withdraws, "action must be taken to ensure progress in creating peaceful conditions."

　　When discussing the Suez Canal issue, the communiqué stated that the six principles adopted by the United Nations Security Council on October 13 last year must be "observed," and expressed support for the activities of United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on this issue.

　　The two sides announced that they were "in agreement in principle" that the United States would provide certain missiles for use by the British army for the sake of "common defense" and "common economic" interests.

　　The communiqué also touched on the issue of German reunification and slandered the Soviet Union on the Hungarian issue.

　　The final part of the communiqué is a statement on nuclear weapons testing. It insists that such testing is "necessary" at present. It states that until the United Nations Disarmament Commission reaches an effective agreement on general disarmament, the "nuclear deterrent" will remain the reliance of the "free world's" security. It talked about the harmful effects of radiation in nuclear weapons testing, but believed that, "for technical reasons," an agreement on limiting nuclear weapons testing cannot be effectively implemented at present. The statement also said that on this issue, the United States and Britain are willing to continue to announce in advance the nuclear tests to be conducted, as well as the location and approximate date of the tests, and are willing to notify the United Nations in advance of future nuclear test plans and allow "limited international observation" of such tests, if the Soviet Union does the same.

　　英美首脑会谈发表联合公报
　　吹嘘军事集团政策坚持试验核子武器在中东问题上用空洞的言词掩饰分歧
    新华社25日讯　百慕大消息：英美两国政府首脑会谈经过三天的会议已经在3月24日结束，并且发表了最后公报。
    公报第一部分是所谓原则宣言。它表示要把两国的外交政策“协调”起来，并且对这次会谈的结果表示“很满意”。
    公报第二部分举出了两国在这次会谈中所达成的协议。
    在这部分，两国重申了军事集团政策，并且重申了“作为两国在西方政策的基石”的北大西洋集团对于它们的特别的重要性。
    在欧洲问题上，两国重申要在大西洋集团内发展欧洲“统一”运动；同意英国与欧洲取得更为密切的联系；认为欧洲和资本主义世界贸易可以从欧洲“共同市场”和“贸易自由区”计划里得到好处，但是又反对把这两个计划发展成建立高额关税集团，并且要各国采取“自由的”贸易政策。
    在中东问题上，公报记载了美国参加巴格达条约军事委员会的决定。
    公报还说，两国同意“有必要迅速执行联合国大会最近有关加沙地带和亚喀巴湾的决议”。这项决议要求在以色列撤退以后，“必须采取行动以保证在创造和平条件这一方面获得进展”。
    公报在谈到苏伊士运河问题的时候，表示要使联合国安全理事会在去年10月13日所通过的六项原则得到“遵守”，并且表示支持联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德关于这个问题的活动。
    双方宣布，“在原则上同意”，为了“共同防御”和“共同经济”的利益，美国将提供某些导弹供英国军队使用。
    公报还谈到德国的统一问题，并且在匈牙利问题上对苏联进行诬蔑。
    公报最后部分是关于原子核武器试验的声明。它坚持这种试验在目前是“必要的”。它说，在联合国裁军委员会就普遍裁军达成行之有效的协议之前，“原子核威慑力量”仍然是“自由世界”安全的依靠。它谈到原子核武器试验中放射作用的有害影响，但是它认为，“由于技术上的原因”，关于限制原子核武器试验的协定目前是无法有效地实施的。声明又说，在这个问题上，美英两国愿意继续在事先公布要进行原子核试验以及试验地点和大概日期，并且愿意事先通知联合国将来要进行的原子核试验计划和允许对这种试验进行“有限的国际观察”，如果苏联也这样做的话。
