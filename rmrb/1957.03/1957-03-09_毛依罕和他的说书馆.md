    Mao Yihan and His Storytelling House
    Qin Damin
    In the northwest corner of the Drum Tower in the center of the new city of Hohhot, there is a small, four-room flat with a Mongolian storytelling house sign hanging on the door. This is the storytelling house of the famous storytellers Mao Yihan and Pa Jie.
    Since its establishment, this storytelling house has become an indispensable entertainment venue for the Mongolian people here; those who come to listen to stories include not only the vast number of Mongolian workers in the new city, but also People's Liberation Army soldiers and students who brave the cold north wind from Mahua Ban, several miles away, to listen to the stories. Every evening, these people rush here, because if they are a little late, they sometimes cannot find a seat.
    One evening, when I went to listen to the storytelling and visit Comrade Mao Yihan, I happened to meet comrades such as the painter Wang Qin who were also there sketching him. All of this could not help but stir his poetic feelings. He picked up his sihu (four-stringed fiddle) and sang without thinking:
    Beautiful silk, how bright,
    Even if worn for a long time, it will fade;
    Close friends, although their hearts are linked,
    They will become estranged if they are not seen for a long time.
    Let's talk to each other,
    How can we know what's in our hearts if we don't talk.
    Hugin (Mongolian Violin), help me,
    Sing that our friendship is even closer! ...
    After he spontaneously sang a poem praising friendship to welcome us, he suddenly noticed a comrade with his lover, and this became good material for him to compose poetry again:
    ...Her bright pair of eyes, my friend,
    Do they shine like stars in your heart?
    How could it not be,
    Because she is your sweetheart!
    Love flies into your heart,
    It will make your heart
    Bloom like a flower,
    Shine like a star in the darkness! ...
    Before I finished drinking the bowl of tea he poured for me, he had already sung so much, and what I translated above is only the general idea.
    Mao Yihan started storytelling at the age of twenty and has been doing it for more than thirty years. In these thirty years, how many poems have flowed from his sihu like a spring! Especially during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, he went to the front lines in Korea and used his songs to encourage the volunteer heroes; after returning, he carried his sihu and traveled all over the vast Xilingol League and Chahar League grasslands, singing everywhere about the bravery of the volunteers and exposing the atrocities of the American imperialist invaders. During this period, how many patriotic poems were produced is hard to imagine. As long as these lyrics are recorded in writing, some of them are very beautiful poems, such as his "Iron Ox" [Note] is an example. This was recorded by others when he was storytelling, and after being translated into Chinese and published, it was praised as a new harvest in recent realistic poetry creation. In fact, if all the lyrics he sang were recorded in writing, there would be countless works like "Iron Ox."
    Like ordinary storytellers, he speaks and sings at the same time. The stories he tells are roughly the same. In addition to some Mongolian folk tales, there are also Journey to the West, Water Margin, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and some romance novels, etc., but each artist has his own unique style, which is mainly reflected in their lyrics. Although the story outline is the same, the lyrics (or good lyrics) are their own creations. They use their own lyrics to portray the characters' personalities, especially good at delicately describing psychology, emotions, and the natural environment, and these descriptions are aided by the accompaniment of the sihu, which enhances its poetic beauty.
    Indeed, what is attractive is not only their lyrics, but also the music. The artist's sihu changes with the development of the story, so the tunes of the sihu are diverse. It can always set off the mood of the protagonist very well, which strengthens the authenticity of the story and the beauty of the image. The combination of these music and lyrics makes the audience feel as if they are in the scene, laughing or lamenting with the protagonist's fate.
    Therefore, whenever I go to listen to the storytelling of the two artists Mao Yihan and Pa Jie, I feel that there is not only an extremely rich heritage of folk oral literature, but also a very beautiful musical heritage; not only should literary workers pay attention to it, but also music workers should pay attention to it.
    When I asked Mao Yihan about his experience in learning this art, he always remembered his aunt. He liked storytelling when he was a child, and his aunt had the heart of a poet. Her speech was always rhyming, and it sounded like poetry. Mao Yihan said: For example, when we occasionally get sick, she kneels in front of the Buddha niche to pray. Listen to how the old lady prays:
    ...Buddha, let my children,
    Rise like the sun,
    Grow like green leaves,
    Rise like the moon,
    Bloom like flowers! ...
    Mao Yihan grew up in such an environment, but he said that he is far behind his aunt.
    Hearing this, I felt a little regret. This talented aunt died, but we know nothing about how much she said and how many beautiful poems she wrote during her lifetime. Death took away her beautiful poems together. What a great loss! This is a tragedy of history, and I think this kind of tragedy cannot be repeated. Our literary and art workers should pick up their pens to help them organize and rescue these beautiful poems, and leave these valuable artistic heritages to our descendants.

    毛依罕和他的说书馆
    钦达木尼
    在呼和浩特新城中央鼓楼的西北角，有一个四间小平房，门上挂着蒙古文说书馆的牌子。这就是著名的说唱艺人毛依罕和爬杰二人的说书馆。
    这个说书馆从它最初成立时起就成了这里蒙古族人民所不可缺少的娱乐场所了；来这里听说书的不但有新城的广大蒙古族职工，也有从好几里远的麻花扳冒着寒冷的北风赶来听书的解放军战士和学生。每到黄昏，这些人就争先地走向这里来，因为稍微迟一点，有时就找不到一个座位了。
    有一天的晚上，我也去听书并顺便访问毛依罕同志时，正赶上画家旺亲等同志也在那里为他画速写画。这一切不能不激起了他的诗情，他拿起四胡不加思索地就唱：
    美丽的绸缎呀，多么鲜艳，
    穿久了，可也要褪色；
    亲密的友人呀，虽然心心相印，
    日久不见也会疏远。
    让我们来谈谈心吧，
    不谈怎知心里话。
    胡琴呀，你来帮助我，
    歌唱我们的友情更亲密！……
    他顺口唱出了歌颂友情的诗篇表示对我们的欢迎之后，又突然发现有一位同志和他爱人在一起，于是这又成了他作诗的好材料：
    ……她那明亮的一双眼呀，我的朋友，
    是否像星星般在你心里闪光？
    怎会不是这样呢，
    因为她是你的心肝呀！
    爱情飞到你的心里，
    它就会使你的心
    像花朵一样怒放，
    像星星般照亮黑暗！……
    给我倒的一碗茶还没有喝完，他已经唱出了这么许多，而且我上边所译只是大意。
    毛依罕从二十岁开始说唱，到现在已有三十多年了。在这三十多年的时间里，随着他那四胡声像泉水般流出的诗歌该有多少呢！特别是在抗美援朝期间，他到过朝鲜前线，用他的歌声鼓舞过志愿军英雄们；回来后，他背着四胡走遍了广大无边的锡林郭勒盟和察哈尔盟大草原，到处歌唱志愿军的英勇和揭露美帝国主义侵略者的暴行。在这个期间该有多少爱国诗篇产生呢，这是很难想像的。他这些唱词只要用文字给记录下来，有的就是非常优美的诗，如他的“铁牤牛”〔注〕就是例证。这是在他说唱的时候，别人给记下来的，译成汉文发表之后，曾被誉为近来现实主义诗歌创作中的一个新收获。其实，他所唱出的一些唱词如果都有文字记录，那么像“铁牤牛”一样的作品就不知有多少了。
    他像一般说唱艺人一样，一边说一边唱，说的故事大致相同，除一些蒙古民间故事外，还有西游记、水浒传、三国以及一些演义小说等，但每一个艺人都有他自己的独特的风格，这主要表现在他们的唱词上。故事梗概虽然是相同的，但唱词（或者说好力宝）则是各人自己的创作。他们用这种自己的唱词来刻画人物的性格，特别是善于细腻地描写心理、情感和自然环境，而这些描写又借助于四胡的伴奏，加强了它的诗的美感。
    真的，吸引人的不仅是他们的唱词，也有音乐。艺人的四胡是随着故事情节的发展而变化的，因此四胡的曲调是多样的，它能随时都很好地衬托出主人翁的心情，这就加强了故事的真实性和形象的美丽。而这些音乐和唱词配合起来就使得听众犹如身临其境，随着主人翁的命运而欢笑或悲叹了。
    因此，每当我去听毛依罕和爬杰二位艺人的说唱时，我就觉得，这里不但有着极其丰富的民间口头文学的遗产，也有非常优美的音乐遗产；不但搞文学工作的应该注意，也应该引起音乐工作者的注意。
    我问毛依罕怎样学习这种艺术的经过，他总是念念不忘他的伯母。他小时喜欢说唱，而他的伯母则有着一颗诗人的心，她的谈吐都是带韵的，听来就像是诗。毛依罕说：比如在我们偶尔得了病时，她跪在佛龛前祈祷，你听她老人家是怎样祈祷的：
    ……佛爷让我的孩子们，
    像太阳般升起，
    像绿叶般茂盛，
    像月亮般升起，
    像花朵般开放吧！……
    毛依罕就是在这样一种环境里长大成人的，但是他比起他的伯母来，他说，还不知要差多远呢。
    听到这里，我有些惋惜之感。这位多才的伯母死去了，可是在她生前她说了多少话，有多少美丽的诗篇，我们是一无所知。死神把她的美丽的诗歌一起带走了，这是多么大的损失啊！这是历史的悲哀，我想这种悲哀再不能重演了。我们的文学艺术工作者应该拿起笔来帮他们整理，把这些优美的诗歌抢救下来，把这些宝贵的艺术遗产留给我们的后代。
