One hundred mu of land around the Sheyang River Sluice in Jiangsu Province has been covered in greenery under the vigorous tree planting efforts of PLA officers and soldiers. Recently, troops stationed in Wuxi mobilized over 1,000 officers and soldiers in one day, planting more than 50,000 saplings. Troops stationed in Tangshan, a suburb of Nanjing, also planted a "Liberation Forest." Border troops stationed in Ningming area, Guangxi Province, planted more than 4,000 saplings on barren hills and in barracks areas, including many fruit trees such as longan and pineapple.
    Officers and soldiers stationed on Huangpu Island, Guangdong Province, actively responded to the call of the leading organs to plant twenty trees per person, determined to make this island with a glorious revolutionary history appear with large green forests within a few years. Troops stationed in Zhanjiang City are also working hard to turn this international commercial city into a garden with lush trees. After the troops stationed in the western suburbs of Xi'an planted more than 24,000 saplings, neat young trees appeared in the middle of the wide roads and in front of a row of newly built buildings. Young officers and soldiers stationed in Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, donated money to purchase saplings and planted them along the roadsides.
