Our newspaper, Hefei, March 3rd: The Li郢zi No. 1 mine in Huainan Coal Mine officially went into production on March 2nd. This is the third newly built mine in Huainan Coal Mine after the Xieji集 No. 2 large mine went into production in the second half of last year.

Li郢zi No. 1 well can produce 600,000 tons of coal annually. This pair of mines is a slope shaft designed according to the principle of less investment and faster coal production. The total investment is less than half of the Xieji集 No. 2 well, which went into production last year. These two wells use electric drills and pneumatic picks to mine coal. The coal from underground to the ground is transported by mechanized equipment such as belt conveyors, scraper conveyors, electric vehicles, and skips, eliminating the heavy physical labor in the transportation环节. These mines are also specially equipped with screening machines to separate the coal supplied to various places into fine coal and lump coal.

Construction of Li郢zi No. 1 well started in November 1954 and was completed on February 6 this year and put into trial production. During the trial production period, it overproduced 189 tons of coal. The workers in the new mine also learned from the experience and lessons of the trial production and carried out safe production activities. They plan to reach a daily output of 1,584 tons this year and strive to reach the design capacity ahead of schedule.

    煤炭工业增加一支生力军
    淮南李郢孜一号井投入生产
    每年可为国家生产六十万吨煤炭
    本报合肥3日电  3月2日，淮南煤矿李郢孜一号矿井正式投入生产。这是淮南煤矿继去年下半年谢家集二对大矿井投入生产后的第三对新建成的矿井。
    李郢孜一号井可年产六十万吨煤炭。这对矿井是按照投资少、出煤快的原则设计的斜井，全部投资不到去年投入生产的谢家集二号井的一半。这对井用电钻和风镐采煤，煤炭从井下到地面全部使用皮带机、链板机、电车、箕斗等机械化设备运送，消灭了运输环节上笨重的体力劳动。这对矿井还专门装备了筛选机器，把供应各地的煤炭分成碎煤和块煤。
    李郢孜一号井是从1954年11月开工建设的，今年2月6日完工转入试生产。试生产期间超额生产了一百八十九吨煤炭。在新矿场生产的职工，还吸取试生产中的经验教训开展了安全生产活动。他们计划在今年使日产量达到一千五百八十四吨，争取提前达到设计能力。
