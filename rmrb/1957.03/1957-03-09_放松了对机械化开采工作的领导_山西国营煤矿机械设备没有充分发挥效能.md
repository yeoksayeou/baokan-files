Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, March 7th (Sha Yin): In the state-owned coal mines within Shanxi Province, at least nine heading loaders and a large number of combined coal miners, coal cutters, small water pumps, electric drills, and small winches are either idle or, due to improper installation, are not being used to their full potential.

Currently, Shanxi state-owned coal mines have a total of fifty coal cutters, ten combined coal miners, one heading combine, nine heading loaders, and more than ten electric locomotives. Calculated by the number of units, the utilization rate of these mechanical equipment generally only reaches about 60%. This is even including the time many devices are idle underground as working time in the statistics. At the same time, in 1956, there were more than 8,400 electrical and mechanical accidents and failures, and the reduction in output due to accidents and failures was equivalent to one mine with an annual output of 300,000 tons not producing for a year.

In recent years, the state has invested a lot in the mechanization of Shanxi state-owned coal mines. Taking the degree of mechanization of coal extraction as an example, it increased by 109 times last year compared to 1950. One of the coal mines with the largest increase in investment – Datong Coal Mine – has reached over 80% in the degree of mechanization of coal extraction and over 90% in the degree of mechanization of horizontal roadway transport. However, the growth rate of the efficiency of underground coal miners in these state-owned coal mines is very slow. Last year, the extraction worker efficiency of Datong Coal Mine only increased by a little over 30% compared to 1950.

This has led to a strange phenomenon in Shanxi state-owned coal mines: the degree of mechanization has increased, but labor productivity has not increased accordingly, and the cost of coal mining cannot be reduced accordingly, and even increases in some cases.

Although there are many objective reasons for the formation of the above situation, when the reporter discussed the direct causes with some负责人 (fù zé rén, persons in charge) and engineers of the Taiyuan Coal Mine Administration, they almost all agreed with the following opinion: In the past few years, there has been a bias towards blindly promoting mechanized production in coal mines.

When promoting mechanized production, Shanxi state-owned coal mines did not train enough technical personnel to master and repair the machines, and many modern equipment were handed over to people who lacked basic knowledge of electromechanical technology. Some magnetic water pump drivers in Yangquan Mining Bureau only know how to turn them on but not off. Many combine drivers do not understand the structure and performance of the machinery. Although Datong Coal Mine has trained hundreds of coal mining machinery drivers since 1952, it still feels that there are not enough coal mining machinery drivers and some coal miners have to be used as substitutes. Not only are there few technical workers who master the machines, but there are also few repair workers. Each mine has one experienced master leading many apprentices, the work cannot be done, and many accidents are caused. Once an accident occurs with the machine, production has to be stopped.

The machine equipment cannot adapt to the natural conditions such as coal seams and geology, and the roadways are not arranged for mechanized mining, which has to reduce the technical specifications of the equipment for use. Since the roadways are not arranged and developed according to the needs of modern mechanized production, many coal chutes have been opened in many mines. It is understood that Datong Coal Mine has to install an average of five electric chutes on each working face, and eleven electric chutes have been installed on one working face in the Fenxi Mining Bureau, but these working faces have not increased production because of the increase in coal chutes. The unreasonable development layout has caused difficulties in transportation and has also made small winches insufficient.

The mines have relaxed their leadership over mechanized mining, so that the efficiency of the equipment has not been fully utilized. The use of coal mining combines in Datong Coal Mine once had a record of 18,000 tons per month, but due to no one being responsible, the efficiency of combine coal mining has now dropped to about 7,000 tons.

A large number of machines cannot be well mastered and used, nor can they be repaired in time. Therefore, Shanxi state-owned coal mines have to use more workers, and even equip double labor organizations (i.e., mechanized labor organizations and non-mechanized labor organizations), so that when these machines break down, some workers can come up to repair them, and other workers can continue mining. Datong Coal Mine, which has the highest degree of mechanization, has an average of eighty-nine workers on each working face, while Yangquan Mining Bureau, which has the second highest degree of mechanization, has only more than sixty workers on each working face. Fenxi Mining Bureau and other units with the lowest degree of mechanization use even fewer workers on each working face than Yangquan Mining Bureau.

According to a负责人 (fù zé rén, person in charge) of the Taiyuan Coal Mine Administration, the above situation can be changed. The method is to implement the centralized use of mechanical equipment. This requires state-owned coal mines to overcome departmentalism, and not only hand over the equipment, but also hand over the workers who can use and repair the machines. However, it is said that so far, no mine is willing to do so.

### 放松了对机械化开采工作的领导  山西国营煤矿机械设备没有充分发挥效能

    放松了对机械化开采工作的领导
    山西国营煤矿机械设备没有充分发挥效能
    新华社太原7日电　新华社记者莎荫报道：在山西境内的国营煤矿中，现在至少有九台掘进装煤机和大批联合采煤机、割煤机、小水泵、电钻、小绞车在睡觉或者由于装用的不恰当，没有能够充分发挥效能。
    现在，山西国营煤矿中共有五十台割煤机，十台联合采煤机，一台掘进康拜因，九台掘进装煤机和十多台电机车。这些机械设备按台数计算，利用率一般的只达到60％左右。这还是把许多设备闲放在井下的时间也作为工作时间统计进去的结果。同时，在1956年内共发生了八千四百多次机电事故和故障，因事故和故障而减少的产量等于一个年产三十万吨的矿井一年没有生产。
    这几年，国家对山西国营煤矿的机械投资很多，就以回采机械化程度来说，去年比1950年提高了一百零九倍。增加投资最多的煤矿之一——大同煤矿，回采机械化程度已经达到80％以上，平巷运搬机械化程度已经达到90％以上。但是，这些国营煤矿井下采煤工效率的增长速度却很缓慢。去年，大同煤矿的回采工效率只比1950年增长了30％多一点。
    这就使得山西国营煤矿中出现了一种奇怪现象：机械化程度提高了，劳动生产率却没有相应提高，而煤的开采成本也不能相应降低，甚至有些增高。
    尽管形成上述状况的客观原因是很多的，但是，当记者同太原煤矿管理局的一些负责人和工程师们探讨那些直接原因的时候，他们几乎都同意这样一种意见：过去几年中，在煤矿中有盲目地推行机械化生产的偏向。
    山西各国营煤矿在推行机械化生产的时候，没有训练足够的掌握机器和检修机器的技术力量，许多现代化的设备交给了一些缺乏机电技术常识的人操作。阳泉矿务局有的磁水泵司机只会开不会关。许多康拜因司机不懂得机械的构造、性能。大同煤矿从1952年以来虽然培养了几百名采煤机械的司机，但是到现在为止采煤机械的司机仍然感到不够用，还要用些采煤工来顶替。不仅掌握机器的技术工人少，检修工人也少。各矿都是一个老师傅带许多学徒，工作做不了，倒造成了许多事故。机器一发生事故，就不得不停止生产。
    机器设备不能适应煤层、地质等自然条件，巷道也不是按机械化开采布置的，这就不得不降低设备的技术规格来使用。由于巷道不是按照现代化机械生产需要布置、开拓的，许多矿井里煤溜子多开了。据了解，大同煤矿平均每个工作面要安装五部电溜子，汾西矿务局的一个工作面中曾经安装了十一部电溜子，而这些工作面却并不因为增加了煤溜子就提高了生产。开拓布置的不合理造成了运搬的困难，也使得小绞车不够用。
    各矿放松了对于机械化开采工作的领导，使得设备效能没有得到充分发挥。大同煤矿使用采煤康拜因曾经出现过月产一万八千吨的纪录，但是，由于无人负责，现在，康拜因采煤效率已下降到七千吨左右。
    大批机械既不能被很好掌握、使用，又不能及时检修，因此，山西各国营煤矿就不得不使用更多的工人，甚至配备双重的劳动组织（即机械化劳动组织和非机械化劳动组织），以便这些机器一出毛病，一部分工人上来检修，另一些工人继续开采。机械化程度最高的大同煤矿，平均每个工作面有八十九个工人，而机械化程度次于大同煤矿的阳泉矿务局每个工作面不过六十多个人，机械化程度最低的汾西矿务局等单位的每个工作面所用的工人甚至比阳泉矿务局还少些。
    据太原煤矿管理局一位负责人说，上述状况是可以改变的。方法就是实行机械设备的集中使用。这就要求各国营煤矿克服本位主义，不仅要把设备交出来，也要把能使用、检修机器的工人交出来。但是，据说到目前为止，还没有一个矿愿意这样做。
