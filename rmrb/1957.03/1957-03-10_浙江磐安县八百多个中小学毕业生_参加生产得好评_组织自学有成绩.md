More Than 800 Primary and Secondary School Graduates in Pan'an County, Zhejiang Province, Participate in Production and Receive Praise; Organized Self-Study Yields Results

    (Reported by our newspaper) Primary and junior high school graduates in Pan'an County, Zhejiang Province, who are participating in agricultural production, are contributing their efforts to agricultural production posts with peace of mind.
    According to statistics, Pan'an County currently has 837 junior high and senior primary school graduates under the age of 25. More than 95% of them have now participated in agricultural production and various tasks in rural areas. Many of them have served as directors of agricultural production cooperatives, production team leaders, accountants, work recorders, technology extension workers, and teachers in people's schools, and have won praise from the local masses. Chen Jinxiang, Chen Jinlu, Chen Suozheng and other junior high and senior primary school graduates in Shangchan Village, Shenzhai District, have actively undertaken the teaching and tutoring work of local people's schools, ensuring the normal progress of teaching work.
    In mid-September last year, Hetang Agricultural Cooperative in Anwen Town began to organize a self-study group for middle and primary school graduates. Subsequently, self-study groups were also organized in Shanghu, Baichuan, Dasha, Fangshan, Huangyutian and other villages. In these self-study groups, primary and secondary school graduates not only consolidated their past learning achievements, but also increased their new knowledge.
    The relevant departments in Pan'an County have carried out planned organization and guidance work for the study of middle and primary school graduates, and this work has received widespread support from people from all walks of life. In addition to the participation of members from the County Youth League Committee and the County Bureau of Culture and Education, the Pan'an County Middle and Primary School Graduate Self-Study Guidance Committee also invited local grassroots cadres, production experts, teachers, literacy cadres, cultural center (station) staff, graduate parents, and graduate representatives to participate. At the same time, the People's Committees of various townships mostly absorbed local middle and primary school graduates when deploying central tasks, and let them share some of the work they could do, so that they could settle down in the countryside. The grassroots organizations of the Communist Youth League in various places conducted education for them through League classes and other activities, and planned to cultivate them to join the League. When various cultural activities are carried out in rural areas, middle and primary school graduates are also organized to participate in a planned manner. Teachers in various places regard the work of tutoring graduates in rural areas as their own task, often hold special lectures, and provide reading guidance to graduates.

    浙江磐安县八百多个中小学毕业生
    参加生产得好评　组织自学有成绩
    本报讯　浙江磐安县参加农业生产的初中、高小毕业生，都安心地在农业生产岗位上贡献自己的力量。
    据统计，磐安县目前共有二十五岁以下的初中、高小毕业生八百三十七人，现在95％以上已参加了农业生产和农村中的各项工作。他们之中有不少人担任了农业生产合作社的社主任、生产队长、会计员、记工员、技术推广员和民校教师；并获得当地群众的好评。深宅区上产村的初中、高小毕业生陈金祥、陈金禄、陈锁正等都积极地担任了当地民校的教学和辅导工作，保证了教学工作的正常进行。
    安文镇荷塘农业社在去年9月中旬开始组织了一个中、小学毕业生自学小组。接着尚湖、?川、大皿、方山、黄余田等村也先后组织了自学小组。这些中小学毕业生在自学小组里，不但巩固了以往的学习成果，还增长了新的知识。
    磐安县有关部门对中、小毕业生的学习进行了有计划地组织和辅导工作，这项工作得到社会人士的广泛支持。磐安县中、小毕业生自学指导委员会除了有青年团县委、县文教科的人员参加外，还邀请了当地的基层干部、生产能手、教师、扫盲干部、文化馆（站）工作人员、毕业生家长和毕业生代表参加。与此同时，各乡人民委员会在布置中心工作时大都吸收当地中小学毕业生参加，并且让他们分担一部分力所能及的工作，使他们在农村中落脚。各地团的基层组织通过上团课和其他活动向他们进行教育，并且有计划地培养他们入团。农村开展各项文化活动时，也有计划地组织中小学毕业生参加。各地教师把辅导在乡毕业生的工作当作自己的任务，经常举办专题讲座，对毕业生进行读书指导。
