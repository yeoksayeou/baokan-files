Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd. The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently decided to allocate ten million yuan from the donations of officers and soldiers to establish twenty-four more small tractor stations this year. The Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteers has also decided to use the donations of officers and soldiers to establish a medium-sized tractor station in the motherland this year.

The plan jointly agreed upon by the General Political Department and the Ministry of Agriculture is to establish two small stations each in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan provinces, and one small station each in Hebei, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Qinghai, Shandong, Hubei, Hunan, and Guizhou provinces, the Tibet region, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Each small station will be equipped with twenty-five standard tractors.

In the Andong area of Liaoning Province, a medium-sized station with fifty standard tractors will be established using donations from Chinese People's Volunteers officers and soldiers and named "Andong Volunteer Army Tractor Station."

Last year, officers and soldiers donated funds to establish ten tractor stations. These ten stations are: two large stations (with one hundred standard tractors) in Dingyuan County, Anhui Province, and Xuchang County, Henan Province; three medium-sized stations in Yan'an County, Shaanxi Province, Gongzhuling City, Jilin Province, and the suburbs of Beijing; and five small stations in Linhe County in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Xindu County in Sichuan Province, the suburbs of Shanghai, the suburbs of Tianjin, and Pingliang area of Gansu Province. Now, except for one in Gansu Province which is still under construction, the other nine tractor stations have been put into spring plowing production one after another.

    用部队官兵的捐款建立二十五个拖拉机站
    新华社23日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部最近决定，从部队官兵捐献的款项中拨出一千万元，在今年内再建立二十四个小型拖拉机站。中国人民志愿军政治部也决定用官兵们的捐款，今年在祖国建立一个中型拖拉机站。
    总政治部和农业部共同商定的计划是：在江苏、浙江、福建、江西、广东、广西、云南等七个省各建立两个小型站，在河北、山西、黑龙江、青海、山东、湖北、湖南、贵州等八个省、西藏地方和新疆维吾尔自治区各建立一个小型站。每个小型站配备拖拉机二十五标准台。
    在辽宁省安东地区，将用志愿军官兵的捐款建立一个拥有拖拉机五十标准台的中型站，命名为“安东志愿军拖拉机站”。
    部队官兵去年已经捐款建立了十个拖拉机站。这十个站是：在安徽省定远县和河南省许昌县的两个大型站（拥有拖拉机一百标准台）；在陕西省延安县、吉林省公主岭市、北京市郊的三个中型站；在内蒙古自治区临河县、四川省新都县、上海市郊、天津市郊、甘肃省平凉专区的五个小型站。现在，除甘肃省的一个还在筹建中外，其他九个拖拉机站都已经先后投入了春耕生产。
