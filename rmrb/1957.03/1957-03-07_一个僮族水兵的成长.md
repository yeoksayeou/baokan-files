    The Growth of a Zhuang Sailor
    Zhong Bin
    Gan Zhengzhong, a Zhuang sailor in the main gun crew, went on a long voyage shortly after joining the ship.
    Gan Zhengzhong grew up in the deep mountains. Seeing highways and cars was already novel enough, but now sailing on this blue, boundless sea, he found everything even more novel: he would wave to the seagulls flying in the azure sky, and giggle at the flying fish startled by the propeller in the sea. However, soon they encountered a Force 8 gale. At this time, on the Qizhou ocean, where even without wind, there are three feet of waves, the towering waves were like mountain peaks, and the blossoming waves hit the bow to the stern, and then from the port side to the starboard side. The ship rolled from side to side up to forty degrees. Gan Zhengzhong felt his head swell and his stomach churn. When it was his turn to stand watch, he could only lie down and moan. The main gun squad leader had to brave the storm and stand on the bow of the ship in Gan Zhengzhong's place.
    The main gun squad was a pearl of the entire ship. Whether it was training or sailing, or putting on shows at evening parties, they were always at the forefront. But this time, a sailor couldn't stand watch, which was indeed a disgrace. As soon as they arrived at the harbor, squad leader Luo Qiping couldn't help but blame himself: why didn't he make Gan Zhengzhong insist on combat duty? What if a war broke out in the future? He also thought that everyone who joined the ship with Gan Zhengzhong could persevere in the wind and waves, why was he the only one who was so disappointing? ...Thinking of this, he felt both sad and angry, and really wanted to criticize this unmotivated sailor. However, when he saw Gan Zhengzhong, after entering the harbor, he seemed to have become a different person. The coconut trees with their tips piercing the blue sky in the harbor, the tall mine bridges and iron sand mountains next to the dock, and the flocks of sea eagles couldn't arouse Gan Zhengzhong's curiosity. His childish smile disappeared, and he looked dispirited, like a guilty elementary school student hiding in a corner. When the main gun squad leader saw this, the fire burning in his heart subsided. He thought: He just came out of the mountains, how could he have seen the sea, let alone experienced such a big storm? ...He also thought that when he first joined the ship, didn't he get dizzy when he saw the waves and feel like vomiting when he smelled the oil? Was there no other way besides criticism to make this Zhuang sailor stand tall in the wind and waves? ...
    The whistle sounded, and the voyage summary meeting began. Today, the main gun squad's meeting was uniquely different: the squad leader didn't criticize, nor did he praise, but simply asked the gunners to discuss their experiences on this long voyage and how to overcome the wind and waves. Veteran sailor Wu Hongda said: "When dealing with wind and waves, find a place with good air circulation when you feel seasick, but don't lie down, because once you lie down, it's not easy to get up." Huang Shengyi, who joined the army with Gan Zhengzhong, said something even more amusing. He said, "I don't have any experience, I just know that if you vomit, you have to force yourself to eat something. Eat, vomit, and eat again, so your stomach won't fight." Originally, Gan Zhengzhong was sitting in a dark corner, not saying a word, waiting to be criticized. But when he heard Huang Shengyi say this, he couldn't help but laugh. This was the first time he had laughed since the storm. The attentive main gun squad leader saw a crystal tear rolling in Gan Zhengzhong's eyes. ...In the evening, Gan Zhengzhong excitedly said to Luo Qiping:
    "Squad leader, I won't say anything else, you just watch during the next voyage!..."
    After some time, the warship was going on another long voyage to cooperate with torpedo boats in exercises on the sea far away from the harbor. The warship was still swaying in the wind and waves. Anyone who gets seasick has this mentality: the first time you get seasick, the second time you see the waves, you feel dizzy and your heart pounds. At this time, Gan Zhengzhong gritted his teeth and kept his head down, without saying a word. Luo Qiping thought, it wouldn't work to just let him grit his teeth and stand in the wind and waves! He must dispel his fear of long voyages and wind and waves, and further teach him how to compete with the wind and waves. So the main gun squad leader immediately issued the order "assemble behind the gun, emergency combat readiness" to the main gun squad. Gan Zhengzhong stumbled to his gun position, prepared the sight, and shouted "Ready!" The voice was so hoarse and weak. Normally, main gun squad leader Luo Qiping would have made him shout it again several times, but this time he didn't correct him and issued the operating commands. Following the main gun squad leader's commands, the main gun rotated and elevated towards the air and sea. After operating for a while, Gan Zhengzhong's voice when reporting "Ready" gradually became louder. ...
    After the operation, the main gun squad leader praised Gan Zhengzhong's spirit of persevering in the wind and waves. After a while, Gan Zhengzhong vomited again, but he didn't become so weak that he couldn't straighten his back like before. Luo Qiping took out fruit and biscuits and shouted loudly, "Eat! Young men!" Yes, when you're seasick, the first bite is the hardest to swallow, but Gan Zhengzhong forced himself to eat a few bites and felt a bit of taste in his mouth. As everyone ate, Wu Hongda, while eating, put a canvas cover from the navigation squad on his head and twisted around a few times, making everyone laugh. For a moment, it was hard to tell on the deck which was the sound of the wind and waves and which was the sound of laughter.
    Gan Zhengzhong smiled confidently. Main gun squad leader Luo Qiping also smiled. ...
    The formation training was about to begin. The sailors were out in the wind and waves all day long, operating on the sea under the stars and moon. Gan Zhengzhong's thin body gradually became stronger, and the sea breeze and scorching sun seemed to have put a bronze-colored garment on his skin. Whenever the main gun squad leader shouted the order "Emergency combat readiness," the first one to report "Ready" at his gun position was often the sight operator Gan Zhengzhong, and his voice became loud and powerful!
    Once, when the warship was sailing, it encountered wind and waves again. The gunners were operating on the bow of the ship, braving the wind and waves. As soon as the operation was over, Gan Zhengzhong, with sweat still on his head, quietly ran down to the lower deck. He vomited again, and Luo Qiping saw all of this. However, when Gan Zhengzhong returned to the bow, the playful Wu Hongda started joking with him again. Gan Zhengzhong said proudly, "I didn't vomit this time!" Just then, a wave hit the bow, and seawater splashed on the gunners like rain, also splashing into Gan Zhengzhong's mouth as he was speaking. He said, "This seawater is so salty!" causing a burst of laughter on the bow. The main gun squad leader saw this and excitedly thought: Gan Zhengzhong has stood tall in the wind and waves!
    Three months after the first long voyage, the naval formation shooting began! After the signal for emergency combat readiness was issued on the ship, a team of planes swept across the sky in a short time, followed by a cloud of smoke appearing in the clear blue sky - this was the signal for the main gun to start firing. Main gun squad leader Luo Qiping issued the firing command, and the bow of the ship shook violently, followed by a loud bang, and the shell burst into bloom next to the cloud of smoke in the air! After this loud bang, main gun sight operator Gan Zhengzhong didn't panic. He quickly and accurately adjusted the sight division back, and the main gun began to roar again! ...Gan Zhengzhong's movements were so accurate and fast that it was hard to tell that he was the same sailor who three months ago was lying in the cabin, unable to get up in the wind and waves.
    Now, this young Zhuang sailor, Gan Zhengzhong, has become a second-class technical expert in the navy!

    一个僮族水兵的成长
    中彬
    主炮班的僮族水兵甘正忠上舰没多久就赶上了远航。
    甘正忠是在深山大岳里长大的，看到公路、看到汽车就已经是很新奇的了，现在航行在这蓝闪闪一眼望不到边的大海上，就处处觉得更加新奇：见到了在碧空中飞翔的海鸥也要招招手，看到海里被螺旋桨惊起来的飞鱼也要咯咯地笑起来。可是，不久就遇上了八级大风。这会儿，无风三尺浪的七洲洋上，矗起的浪涛像一座座山峰，开花的浪头从船头打到船尾，又从左舷打到了右舷，船身左右摇摆到四十度。甘正忠只觉得脑袋发胀，心里发呕，轮到他战斗值班的时候，他只能躺下哼哼了。主炮班长只好迎着风暴，代替甘正忠站到船头上。
    主炮班是全舰的一颗珍珠，无论是训练和出航，或者是晚会出节目都是跑到前头；可是这次航行竟有一个水兵不能值班，这的确是件不光采的事儿。一到了海港，班长罗起平不禁心里埋怨起自己来：为什么不让甘正忠坚持战斗值班呢？假如以后打起仗来会怎样呢？他又想，和甘正忠一起上舰的都能在风浪中坚持，他为什么偏偏不争气呢？……想到这儿，他又难过又生气，真想把这个不要强的水兵批评一通。可是，他又一看甘正忠进入海港以后好像变成了另外一个人。海港里尖梢插到蓝天的椰子树，码头旁边的高大的矿桥和铁沙山，还有那成群结队的海鹰都引不起甘正忠的好奇心来。他那孩子气的笑容消失了，无精打彩地像是犯了过错的小学生闷头躲在一个角落里。主炮班长一看这情形，窝在心里的一股火儿平息了。他想：人家是刚从大山里走出来的，哪里见过什么海，更不要说经受这样大的风浪了……他又想到，自己刚上舰还不是见了浪头就发晕，闻着油味想呕吐吗？难道除了批评就没有别的法子让这个僮族水兵在风浪中挺起腰杆来么？……
    哨音响了，航行总结会开始了。今天主炮班的会开得奇特：班长没有批评，更没有表扬，只是让炮手们座谈座谈这次远航的体会和怎样战胜风浪。老水兵吴洪达说：“同风浪打交道，在晕船的时候要找个空气流畅的地方，可千万不要倒下，一躺下就不容易站起来了。”和甘正忠一块儿参军的黄胜义讲的更惹人笑，他说：“我什么经验也没有，只知道吐了要硬吃点东西，吃了吐，吐了吃，肚子里就不打架了。”本来甘正忠坐在一个暗暗的角落里一言不发，正等着挨批评呢，可是听黄胜义这么一讲，他也忍不住笑起来。这是风浪后他第一次发笑。细心的主炮班长看到了甘正忠眼眶里正滚动着一颗晶莹的泪珠。……晚上，甘正忠激动地对罗起平讲：
  “班长，我什么也不说了，以后航行的时候你瞧吧！……”
    过了一些时候，军舰又要远航了，这次是在远离海港外的海面上配合鱼雷快艇演习。军舰仍是在风浪中摇摆着。凡是晕船的人都有这样的心理：第一次晕船了，第二次见了浪头头晕眼花，心里突突地跳。这时，甘正忠在海上咬牙闷头又不哼声了。罗起平一想，让他光是咬着牙在风浪里挺着干也不行呀！必须解除他对远航风浪的恐惧心理，进一步教会他和风浪较量的方法。于是主炮班长马上向主炮班发出“炮后集合，紧急备战”的口令。只见甘正忠踉踉跄跄奔到炮位上，把表尺准备好，喊了一声“好！”这声音是那么嘶哑无力。要是平时，主炮班长罗起平一定得让他重新喊几次，这回他没有纠正他，就发出操作的口令。随着主炮班长的口令，主炮对空对海回旋俯仰起来，操作了一会儿，甘正忠报告“好”的声音也逐渐大起来了。……
    操作完了，主炮班长表扬了甘正忠在风浪中坚持操作的精神。过了一会儿，甘正忠又吐了，可是不像以前那样直不起腰来了。罗起平把水果和饼干拿出来大声喊：“吃呀！小伙子们！”是呵，晕船时吃东西，第一口是最难咽下去的，可是甘正忠挺着吃了几口，也就觉得嘴里有点滋味了。大家吃着，吴洪达一边吃着，一边把航海班的一个帆布套扣在脑袋上，扭捏了几下子，逗得大伙儿咯咯地笑起来。一时甲板上也分不清哪是风浪声，哪是笑声了。
    甘正忠自信地笑了。主炮班长罗起平也笑了。……
    编队训练快要开始了，水兵们整天风里来浪里去，披星戴月在海上操作着。甘正忠瘦弱的身体逐渐结实起来，海风吹，烈日晒，好像给他的皮肤穿上了青铜色的衣裳。每当主炮班长喊出“紧急备战”的口令时，第一个在炮位上报告“准备好”的常常是表尺手甘正忠，他的声音变得洪亮有力了！
    有一次军舰在航行中，又遇上风浪，炮手们都顶着风浪在船头上操作着。刚操作完，甘正忠头上还冒着汗，就悄悄地向下甲板跑去，他又吐了，这一切罗起平都看在眼里。可是，当甘正忠回到了船头的时候，好闹玩的吴洪达又同他开起玩笑来。甘正忠好强地说：“这回咱可没吐噢！”偏偏这时，一个浪头打到船头，海水像下雨似的溅到炮手们的身上，也溅到正在说话的甘正忠的嘴里。他说：“这口海水好咸呀！”引起船头上一阵大笑。主炮班长看到了，兴奋地想：甘正忠在风浪中挺起腰杆来了！
    距离第一次远航的三个月以后，海上编队射击开始了！舰上紧急备战的信号发出后，不一会儿只见一队飞机掠空而过，紧接着在瓦蓝瓦蓝的晴空中出现了一团爆烟——这是主炮开始射击的信号，主炮班长罗起平发出了射击的口令，只见船头猛的一震动，轰的一声巨响，炮弹在空中那团爆烟旁边炸开了花！这声巨响以后，主炮表尺手甘正忠并没有慌，他手急眼快把表尺分划扳回来，主炮又开始怒吼了！……甘正忠的动作是那么准确飞快，使人再看不出他就是三个月前在风浪中躺在舱里爬不起来的那个水兵了。
    现在，这位僮族的青年水兵甘正忠已经成为海军二级技术能手了！
