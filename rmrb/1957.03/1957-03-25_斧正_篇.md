　　“Axe Correction”
　　Fang Jin
    Zhuangzi's fables often use simple stories to illustrate profound truths. These stories still have enlightening and educational significance for us today. "The Craftsman of Ying and the Axe" is one of them.

    The story goes something like this:

    In the State of Chu, there was a man who had a speck of white dirt, about the size of a fly's wing, stuck to the tip of his nose. He asked a stonemason to chip it off for him. The stonemason asked him to sit still and not move. Then the stonemason raised his axe and, like a gust of wind, swept it across his nose. The speck of white dirt fell off, but the man's nose was not even scratched.

    Therefore, later generations called asking people to revise articles "axe correction." They dared to send their "nose" over because they believed in the reviser's skill. The reviser should naturally take it seriously, wielding his "axe" under the principle of "chopping off the white dirt without injuring the nose."

    Successful revisions can turn the wrong into the right, the useless into the useful, the ugly into the more beautiful, and the bad into the better. The reviser's labor is often indispensable and worthy of respect. In order to improve the quality of articles, we should not tire of repeated revisions, discuss with others in many ways, and learn from the ancients' spirit of not being careless with a single word in their essays.

    However, inappropriate revisions can sometimes have the opposite result. Some revisers cannot distinguish between nasal flesh and white dirt, and swing their axes based on subjective assumptions. Therefore, often either the white dirt is not chipped off, or someone's nose is forcibly cut off. A face after being axed, dripping with blood, is even more unsightly than with a speck of white dirt.

    Subjectively revising the articles of the ancients, making them appear flayed and torn between the lines, although general readers may not necessarily see it, insiders, upon seeing a distorted reprint of an ancient book, and thinking of the rarity of the ancient book and the difficulty of reprinting, cannot help but feel惋惜. Moreover, the revised version is neither ancient nor modern, greatly reducing its significance in reflecting the era and its reference value.

    Every author, even if not a "well-known person," when seeing their published work altered to be completely different from their intended meaning, will be left not knowing whether to laugh or cry. If he goes to the editorial department to request a statement of correction, it would seem a bit of an overreaction; if he remains silent, he seems to feel wronged. I believe that the editorial department has the right to revise works, but if there are many revisions, it is better to seek the author's opinion as much as possible before publication.

    I hope that editors will think more about the story of "The Craftsman of Ying and the Axe" when revising manuscripts.

### “斧正”篇

　　“斧正”篇
　　方今
    庄子的寓言中有很多用浅显的故事来说明深刻的道理的。这些故事在现在对我们也还有启发和教育的意义。“郢人运斧”就是其中的一个。
    故事的内容大概是这样：
    楚国有一个人，他的鼻子尖上粘着一点与苍蝇的翅膀一般大小的白色的土。他请一个石匠来替他削掉。石匠请他坐好，要他一动也别动。然后石匠举起斧头，一阵风似地从他的鼻子上掠过。那一点白土掉了下来，楚人的鼻子却没有受到一点伤。
    因此以后的人请人家修改文章叫做“斧正”。相信修改者的本领，才敢把“鼻子”送过去的。修改者自然应该慎重其事，在“既要斫掉白土，又要不伤鼻子”的原则下，挥动他的“斧头”。
    成功的修改能把错误的变为正确的、无用的变为有用的、不美的变为较美的、不好的变为较好的。修改者的劳动常常是不可少的，是值得尊重的。为了提高文章的质量，我们应该不厌屡次修改，与人多方推敲，学习古人论文不苟一字的精神。
    可是修改不适当，有时会发生相反的结果。有些修改者分不清鼻肉和白土，主观臆断地挥动他的斧头。因此往往不是白土未被削掉，便是硬把人家的鼻子割了下来。斧削以后的面孔，鲜血淋漓，比沾点白土更不雅观。
    主观主义地删改古人的文章，弄得它字里行间，皮开肉绽，虽然一般读者不一定看得出来，但是内行人看到一本走了样的古籍重印本，想到古本的难见，重印的艰苦，自有不胜惋惜的感觉。而且删改后的本子，古不古，今不今，大大削减了它反映时代的意义和参考的价值。
    每个作者，即使并非“知名之士”，看到被发表了的自家的作品，被窜改得全不是自己的意思时，是会哭笑不得的。若是他去编辑部要求声明更正，未免有些小题大作；若是他默不作声，内心又似乎感到冤枉。我以为编辑部是有修改作品的权利的，但如果修改得多，发表以前，尽可能地征求一下作者的意见，那是比较好的。
    我希望编辑们在修改稿件的时候，多想一想“郢人运斧”的故事。
