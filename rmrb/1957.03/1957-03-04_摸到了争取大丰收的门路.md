Found the Key to Strive for a Bumper Harvest
By our reporter Zhen Weimin

How is the spring plowing and production work being prepared? What problems exist? How can we strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year? These are the questions that every leader is concerned about. The Wu County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent Liang Chuanlu, Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, and some county and district cadres to the Baofeng First Agricultural Cooperative in Bao'an Township, Huguan District, in early February to find out about this situation and find the key to striving for a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year.

The Baofeng First Agricultural Cooperative is a production-increasing cooperative, and 90% of the cooperative members have increased their income. However, there is a negative and fearful sentiment among grassroots cadres and the masses, believing that "the summer harvest reduction is already a certainty, and there is no way to increase the autumn harvest," which seriously affects the development of the spring production campaign. What is the reason for this? According to investigations and understanding of the masses by county and district cadres, the following ideological problems were discovered: Many cooperative cadres and members felt that although production increased last year, it did not reach the "thousand-jin cooperative" target in the plan, so they were negative and dissatisfied. Party member Zhou Shuigen said, "Last year's production was like a goat climbing a tree—a waste of effort; a bamboo basket drawing water—a waste of time." Deputy Director Yin Jin'nan also sighed and said, "I really hoped that last year's production would be famous throughout the county, but unexpectedly, it only ended up at the bottom." (This cooperative was rated as a third-class high-yield cooperative in the county.) Some cadres only saw that the summer crops this year were not growing well and that there was insufficient fertilization, so they were disappointed in this year's production. Management Committee member Chen Jinzao said, "Last year's production was hot and bustling, this year the fields are bare, the rivers and ponds are empty, the summer harvest is dangerous, and the autumn harvest will be lost." Therefore, they are not very motivated in their work.

According to the instructions of the County Party Committee, "three views and three calculations" were carried out among grassroots cadres and the masses to help them recognize the superiority of cooperation and the achievements in agricultural production last year. The specific content of the "three views and three calculations" is: First, look at the year's situation and calculate the natural disaster account; second, look at the output and calculate the production increase and income account; and third, look at life and calculate the improved life account. From the perspective of this cooperative, the disaster situation in 1954 was concentrated, and a heavy rain caused the disaster; although natural disasters were frequent last year, they were not concentrated, and many people mistakenly believed that last year's disaster was not more serious than 1954. After sorting out the natural disaster account on a daily and hourly basis, the masses recognized the severity of last year's disaster. Under this circumstance, the entire cooperative achieved a greater harvest than in 1955, with an increase of 184 jin of grain per mu of rice and wheat fields compared to 1955. In this way, cadres and the masses felt that last year's achievements were even more valuable. Experience has proven that the more detailed and specific the natural disaster account is calculated, the more the masses can understand that the production achievements in 1956 did not come easily, thus more specifically recognizing the superiority of cooperation.

However, in this production-increasing cooperative, it is more difficult to free cadres and the masses from the atmosphere of insufficient confidence in current production increase than it is to get them to recognize the superiority of cooperation and the achievements of last year's production. Therefore, they held separate forums for old farmers and meetings of cooperative member representatives to specifically analyze the favorable conditions for this year's production and find the potential for increasing production. The views of experienced farmers are very practical. At the old farmer meeting of Baofeng No. 1 Cooperative, they pointed out that this year's production has five major favorable conditions compared with last year: First, this year's base fertilizer is more sufficient than last year. Although the amount of fertilizer applied last year was large and the fertilization was early, the quality was not as good as this year. This year, the number of pigs raised in the entire cooperative increased from 180 last year to 600; last year, each mu of land had 100 jin of rice straw, and this year it is planned to have 250 jin; in addition, the planting area of red clover (green manure) has been expanded, and the quality of fertilizer can be greatly improved compared with previous years. Everyone unanimously believes that as long as we add more effort, the amount of accumulated fertilizer will not be less than last year. Second, there was still a conservative mindset in promoting improved varieties last year. 1,700 mu of "261" rice varieties were planted, and each mu would yield 20 jin less than planting "853" rice varieties. This year, 80% of the farmland will be replanted with the "853" variety, and this item alone can increase production by 30,000 jin. Third, the entire cooperative has 570 mu of low-yielding land, with a yield of about 100 jin lower than other fields. It is planned to spend 1,000 working days to open ten water diversion ditches, improve irrigation conditions, and eliminate low-yielding land. Calculated at an increase of 50 jin per mu, these 570 mu of land can also increase production by 28,500 jin. Fourth, in terms of improving the farming system, the yields of double-cropping rice and dry direct seeding planted last year varied from team to team, with a difference of 100-300 jin. This year, there is a certain amount of experience, rational layout, and improved technology, and there is great hope for increasing production. Fifth, cooperative cadres have accumulated experience in leading collective production, and cooperative members have also developed a certain habit of collective labor. Through analysis, the cadres' sentiment that there is no way to increase production this year has been eliminated, and a production plan for the entire year of 1957 has been smoothly formulated, deciding to increase production by 400,000 jin of grain, estimating that each cooperative member can increase their income by 150 yuan.

Although the ideological concerns that there is no way to increase the autumn harvest have been dispelled, the idea that "the summer harvest reduction has become a certainty" still exists. However, to strive for a bumper harvest for the whole year, we must first strive for an increase in the summer harvest. Therefore, they made a specific analysis of the favorable conditions for increasing the summer harvest. They worked with cooperative cadres to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the fields and immediately launched a general topdressing of fertilizer for the poorly growing wheat seedlings, opening drainage ditches and draining snow water. At the old farmer symposium, they also identified the potential for increasing the summer harvest, which boosted the confidence of cadres and the masses. Now, this cooperative has shifted to practical actions to strive for increased production of summer crops.

    摸到了争取大丰收的门路
    本报记者  甄为民
    春耕生产工作准备的怎么样？存在那些问题？怎样才能争取今年农业生产的大丰收？这是当前每一个领导人员所关心的问题。中共吴县县委会于2月上旬派县委副书记梁传禄和一些县区干部到浒关区保安乡保丰第一农业社，摸清了这方面的情况，找到了争取今年农业生产大丰收的门路。
    保丰第一农业社是个增产社，全社90％的社员都增加了收入。可是基层干部和群众中却存在着“夏熟减产已定，秋熟增产无门”的消极畏难情绪，严重地影响了春季生产运动的开展。这是什么原故呢？据县区干部深入群众中调查了解，发现以下一些思想问题：不少社干部和社员感到去年虽然增产了，并没有达到计划中的“千斤社”的指标，因而消极不满。党员周水根说：“去年的生产是羊子爬树——白爬；竹篮打水——一场空。”副社长殷金男也唉声叹气地说：“实指望去年的生产全县闻名，却不料只弄到个末等。”（这个社被评为全县三等高额丰产社）有些干部只看到今年夏熟作物生长不好，施肥不足，就对今年生产失望。管委会委员陈金早说：“去年生产是热哄哄，今年是田里白，河塘空，夏熟危险，秋熟落空。”因而工作劲头不大。
    根据县委的指示，在基层干部和群众中进行了“三看三算”，帮助他们认清合作化的优越性和去年农业生产上的成绩。“三看三算”的具体内容是：一、看年景，算自然灾害账；二、看产量，算增产增收账；三、看生活，算改善生活账。从这个社的情况来看，1954年灾情集中，一场大雨造成灾害；去年自然灾害虽然频繁，但不集中，许多人就误认为去年灾害不比1954年严重。经过按日按时的排了自然灾害的账，群众才认清了去年灾害的严重性。在这种情况下，全社还取得比1955年更大的丰收，每亩稻麦田比1955年增产了一百八十四斤粮食。这样，干部和群众就更加觉得去年的成绩可贵了。经验证明：自然灾害的账算得越细、越具体，群众越能领会到1956年的生产成绩得来不易，从而更加具体地认识到合作化的优越性。
    但是，在这个增产社里，要把干部和群众从对当前增产信心不足的气氛中解脱出来，就比要他们认识合作化的优越性和去年生产的成绩更加困难了。因此，他们分别召开老农座谈会，社员代表会，具体分析今年生产的有利条件，寻找增产潜力。有经验的农民的看法倒是很实在的。在保丰一社的老农会上，他们指出了今年比去年生产有五大有利条件：第一，今年基肥比去年足，去年施肥量虽然多，施肥也早，但质量没有今年好。今年全社养猪由去年的一百八十头增到六百头；去年每亩田垩稻草一百斤，今年准备垩二百五十斤；其他还有红花草（绿肥）种植面积扩大，肥料的质量可以比往年大大提高。大家一致认为：只要再加一把劲，积肥数量也不比去年少。第二，去年推广良种还有保守思想，种了一千七百亩“261”稻种的水稻，每亩要比种“853”稻种少收二十斤。今年80％的农田换种“853”品种，仅这一项就可以增产三万斤。第三，全社有五百七十亩低产田，产量比其他田低一百斤左右。计划今年花一千个劳动日，开输水沟十条，改善灌溉条件，消灭低产田。以每亩增产五十斤计算，这五百七十亩田也可以增产二万八千五百斤。第四，在改良耕作制度方面，去年种植双季稻、旱直播，各队产量不一，高低相差一百——三百斤，今年已有了一定的经验，合理布局，改进技术，增产也大有希望。第五，社干部积累了领导集体生产的经验，社员对集体劳动也有了一定的习惯。通过分析，干部对今年增产无门的情绪消除了，顺利地制定了1957年全年的生产规划方案，决定增产四十万斤粮食，估计每户社员可增加收入一百五十元。
    秋熟增产无门的思想顾虑虽然解除了，“夏熟减产已成定局”的思想还存在着。但是，要争取全年丰收，必须首先争取夏熟增产。因此，他们对夏熟增产的有利条件又作了具体分析。他们配合社干部深入田间作了一次全面检查，对生长不好的麦苗，立即发动社员普遍进行了一次追肥，开好排水沟，排除雪水。在老农座谈会上，也找出了夏熟增产的潜力，提高了干部和群众的信心。现在，这个社已经转入了争取夏熟作物增产的实际行动中。
