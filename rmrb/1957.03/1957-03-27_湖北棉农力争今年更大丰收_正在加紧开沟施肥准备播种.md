Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 26th. As the spring plowing season draws near, preparatory work in Hubei Province's cotton-producing areas is becoming increasingly busy. These days, cotton farmers are busy accumulating fertilizer, selecting seeds, and digging ditches to apply fertilizer, striving to complete this year's plan to increase the province's cotton output by 10% to 15% compared to last year's unprecedented bumper harvest.

Hubei Province is a double-cropping area for wheat and cotton. The vast majority of cotton in the province is intercropped in wheat fields, so applying base fertilizer is very important. In the Ebei area, which has the lowest cotton yield in the province, applying base fertilizer has become an important measure to increase cotton yield this year. Cotton farmers in Zaoyang, Xiangyang, and other counties have already dug ditches and applied fertilizer to hundreds of thousands of acres of wheat fields, waiting for the sowing season to arrive. In order to meet the needs of a significant increase in fertilizer application this year, the fertilizer accumulation campaign in Hubei Province's cotton-producing areas has been vigorous, and various places have come up with many tricks to increase fertilizer accumulation. To date, the fertilizer accumulated in various places has reached about 70% of the required amount, and it is more and better than the fertilizer accumulated in the same period last year.

In order to improve the quality of cotton, the planting area of ​​high-quality cotton, Dai Zi Cotton, will be increased from more than 5 million mu last year to more than 7 million mu this year. All localities are very serious about seed selection. In Tianmen and other counties, more than 90% of the seeds have undergone grain selection and pesticide seed dressing. Various localities have also trained a large number of technicians to impart cotton sowing techniques. At the same time, various localities have learned from last year's insect pest disaster and actively launched the "Three Clears" (weeds cleared, cotton warehouses swept clean, and rotten cotton disposed of) campaign to prevent the spread of insect pests.

　　湖北棉农力争今年更大丰收
　　正在加紧开沟施肥准备播种
    新华社武汉26日电　春耕季节日益迫近，湖北省产棉区的备耕工作愈加繁忙了。这些天来，棉农们正在忙着积肥、选种、开沟施肥，力争完成今年全省棉花产量比空前丰收的去年再提高10％到15％的计划。
    湖北省是个麦、棉两熟地区。全省绝大部分棉花是在麦地里套种的，因此施基肥很重要。全省棉花产量最低的鄂北地区，今年已把施基肥当成提高棉花产量的一项重要措施。枣阳、襄阳等县的棉农们已经在几十万亩麦地里开好了沟，施好了肥，只等播种季节到来。为了适应今年施肥量显著增加的需要，湖北省产棉区的积肥运动，一直声势浩大，各地想了很多窍门增积肥料。到目前止，各地积下的肥料已经达到需要数量的70％左右，比去年同期积的肥料又多又好。
    为了提高棉花质量，今年良种棉岱字棉的种植面积将从去年的五百多万亩增加到七百多万亩。各地对选种工作很认真。天门等县90％以上的种籽都经过了粒选和农药拌种。各地还训练了大批技术员，以传授棉花的播种技术。和这同时，各地接受去年虫害的教训，积极展开了“三光”（杂草锄光，棉花仓库扫光，烂棉处理光）运动，预防虫害蔓延。
