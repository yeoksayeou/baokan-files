Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: According to TASS reports: After the Japanese exploration ship "Soya" was trapped in layers of ice floes in the Antarctic Ocean, it sent out a distress signal; the Soviet exploration ship "Ob," which was on its way back home, immediately turned back to Antarctica after hearing the news and rescued the "Soya" from danger. The "Soya" is only two thousand six hundred tons, it is a small icebreaker that can only sail in thin ice. It was also the first time it had sailed to Antarctica. However, after it sent the Japanese expedition team to the Antarctic continent, it was blocked by layers of ice floes in Lutzow-Holm Bay, several nautical miles from the coast, before it could sail into the ocean. As the Antarctic autumn cold approached, the ship was in danger of being trapped in the ice floes for the winter. The captain of the "Soya" sent out a distress signal.

At this time, the Soviet "Ob" diesel-electric ship, which had completed the first stage of Antarctic exploration and was on its way home, was conducting exploration work in the southern Indian Ocean. Professor Maksimov, the captain of the "Ob," received the distress signal from the "Soya." Considering the serious situation faced by the Japanese ship, he immediately decided to put aside the current marine research work and turn back to Antarctica to rescue the "Soya."

On February 23, the "Ob" began to return to Antarctica. The ocean was stormy and the voyage was extremely difficult. After two days and nights, it sailed more than 600 nautical miles. At noon on February 28, the edge of the ice floes appeared on the horizon. Another ship of the Japanese Antarctic expedition team, the "Umitaka-Maru," was anchored nearby. It could not sail in the ice floe area and therefore could not rescue the "Soya." The "Ob" continued to advance, entering the ice floe area. At this time, the mast of the "Soya" appeared next to the iceberg. However, the sailing conditions in the ice floe area were very difficult, and some ice blocks were as thick as four meters. The "Ob" had to break through the ice to move forward. After fighting with the ice blocks for six hours, the "Ob" slowly came to the side of the "Soya."

Later, the "Soya" followed behind the "Ob," along a wide waterway full of crushed ice blocks, and safely escaped the danger.

The brave rescue of the Japanese ship by the Soviet sailors, despite the thick ice, deeply moved the Japanese sailors.

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese exploration ship "Soya," which was trapped in the ice in Antarctica, was rescued by the Soviet icebreaker "Ob" on February 28. The Director-General of the Japan Coast Guard, Tatsujiro Shimakui, sent a telegram on the 2nd to thank the "Ob" and the American ship "Glacier," which was on its way to rescue.

### 不顾南极严寒  冲破层层坚冰  苏联“鄂毕号”营救遇险日船

    不顾南极严寒  冲破层层坚冰
    苏联“鄂毕号”营救遇险日船
    新华社2日讯  据塔斯社报道：日本的考察船“宗谷号”在南极海洋上被层层浮冰困住以后，发出了求救的信号；正在返国途中的苏联考察船“鄂毕号”闻讯后立即折回南极，把“宗谷号”从险境中救了出来。“宗谷号”只有二千六百吨，它是一只不大的、只能在薄冰中行驶的破冰船。它还是第一次远航到南极来。但是，它在把日本考察队送到南极大陆后，还来不及驶进大洋，就被层层浮冰阻隔在离海岸数浬的吕措夫—霍姆湾中。由于南极秋天的寒冷日益迫近，这只轮船有被困在浮冰中度过严冬的危险。“宗谷号”的船长发出了遇险求救的信号。
    这时候，已经完成了南极探险的第一阶段工作而在返国途中的苏联“鄂毕号”柴油电动机船，正在南印度洋进行考察工作。“鄂毕号”船长马克西莫夫教授接到了“宗谷号”的求救信号，他考虑到这只日本船所面临的严重情况，立刻决定搁下当前的海洋研究工作，折回南极营救“宗谷号”。
    2月23日，“鄂毕号”开始折返南极。海洋中暴风强烈，航行极为困难。经过了两个昼夜，航行了六百多浬。2月28日中午，地平线上出现了浮冰的边缘，日本南极考察队的另一艘轮船“海鹰丸”停在附近，它由于不能在浮冰地带行驶，因此无法救援“宗谷号”。“鄂毕号”继续前进，驶进了浮冰地带，这时冰山旁边露出了“宗谷号”的桅杆。但是，浮冰地带的航行条件十分困难，有些冰块竟厚达四公尺。“鄂毕号”必须破冰前进。在同冰块搏斗了六小时以后，“鄂毕号”才慢慢地来到了“宗谷号”的旁边。
    后来，“宗谷号”就跟在“鄂毕号”后面，沿着一条满是击碎的冰块的宽阔的水道，平安地脱离了险境。
    苏联海员不顾厚冰阻挠而勇敢地营救日本船只的行为，使日本海员深为感动。
    据新华社2日讯  东京消息：在南极陷入冰层的日本考察船“宗谷号”，在2月28日被苏联破冰船“鄂毕号”营救脱险。日本海上保安厅长官岛居辰次郎2日打电报感谢“鄂毕号”和正在前往营救的美国船“冰河号”。
