    Rationally Issuing Agricultural Loans

Doing a good job in agricultural lending plays an important role in supporting farmers' spring plowing and production and striving for a bumper agricultural harvest this year.

The Gansu Daily published an editorial on February 27 entitled "Rationally Issuing Agricultural Loans." This year, Gansu Province's agricultural loan quota has been increased compared to last year. However, due to the large amount of long-term loans issued last year, and the failure to recover all due loans in some areas in the second half of the year, the actual loans that can be issued this year are only about 60% of last year's. With reduced agricultural loan funds and a further expansion of agricultural production scale, it is necessary to improve the quality of agricultural loan work, use agricultural loan funds more rationally, and maximize the role of existing funds.

The editorial stated that this year's agricultural loan work in Gansu Province should be guided by consolidating and improving agricultural producers' cooperatives, helping members solve production and living difficulties, and developing agricultural and sideline production. It is necessary to overcome the phenomenon of indiscriminate lending without prioritizing, and to use funds rationally and in a focused manner; it is also necessary to actively organize all possible funds to give strong support to agricultural cooperatives that need loans; it is also necessary to prevent the one-sided view of thriftiness that is divorced from production, and the bias that less loans are better or no loans are even better. From the perspective of the overall situation in Gansu Province, this year's agricultural loans should mainly be used for agricultural cooperatives' production turnover needs and the development of small-scale water conservancy. A portion of funds should also be appropriately allocated to help poor farmers who have difficulty paying their public ownership share funds. Long-term capital construction loans should be carried out according to local needs and financial capacity, and within one's capabilities. Loans for members' personal living expenses can be appropriately reduced so that limited funds can be concentrated on the most urgent aspects of production.

Based on last year's experience, the Agricultural Bank must carefully analyze the production and financial plans of agricultural cooperatives in the spirit of "running cooperatives diligently and frugally" when issuing agricultural loans, and help them gradually implement economic accounting. At the same time, agricultural cooperatives should also give play to their own manpower, material resources, and financial resources. Only when funds are truly insufficient should appropriate loans be made based on actual needs and possibilities. Loans to individual members should focus on sideline occupations and food rations, and should be issued by credit cooperatives. While issuing loans, the Agricultural Bank should also always pay attention to recovering loans that are due and lead credit cooperatives to vigorously absorb deposits.

The editorial concluded: Party and government organizations at all levels should incorporate agricultural loan work into the unified arrangement of spring plowing production, so that loans are closely integrated with agricultural production investment, pre-purchase deposits, relief funds, and immigrant subsidies, so as to achieve mutual cooperation and avoid mutual disconnection and duplication and waste.

### 合理发放农业贷款

    合理发放农业贷款
    做好农业贷款工作，对支援农民春耕生产，争取今年农业大丰收，有重要作用。
    甘肃日报为此在2月27日发表了“合理发放农业贷款”的社论。今年甘肃省农贷指标比去年继续有所增加，但是，由于去年长期性贷款投放较多，下半年一部分地区又没有及时把应收的贷款全部收回来，因而今年实际可以发放的贷款只相当于去年的60％左右。在农贷资金减少，而农业生产规模还要进一步扩大的情况下，就必须提高农贷工作质量，更加合理地使用农贷资金，发挥现有资金的最大作用。
    社论说，甘肃省今年的农贷工作，应以巩固和提高农业生产合作社，帮助社员解决生产、生活困难，发展农副业生产，作为指导思想。既要克服不分主次盲目贷放的现象，合理地重点地使用资金；也要积极组织一切可以组织的资金，给需要贷款的农业社以大力支持；还应该防止脱离生产的片面节约观点，认为贷款越少越好和不贷更好的偏向。从甘肃全省情况来看，今年农贷主要应该用在农业社生产周转需要和发展小型水利方面。对贫农在交纳公有化股份基金方面的困难，也应适当划出一部分资金给予解决。长期性的基本建设贷款，应根据当地需要和资金力量，量力而行。对于社员个人的生活贷款可适当收缩，以使有限的资金能集中用到生产最迫切需要的方面。
    根据去年经验，农业银行在发放农贷时，必须本着“勤俭办社”的精神，仔细分析农业社的生产和财务计划，帮助它们逐步实行经济核算；同时，各农业社也应该发挥本身的人力、物力和财力的作用，资金确实不足时，再根据实际需要和可能，进行适当的贷款。社员个人贷款，应以副业和口粮为主，由信用社贷放。农业银行在发放贷款的同时，还应该经常注意收回到期贷款，并领导信用社大力吸收存款。
    社论最后说：各级党政组织在安排春耕生产时，应当把农贷工作统一安排进去，使贷款与农业生产投资、预购定金、救济款和移民补助费等密切结合，以收相互协作配合之效，避免互不衔接和发生重复浪费现象。
