    Regarding the Development of the Electric Power Industry
    Speech by Bao Guobao
    Please allow me to express some opinions on the following two issues.
  (1) The Coordination of Industry and Electricity
    At present, the electricity supply is very tight in many regions of the country. The main reason is that the demand for electricity is increasing very quickly, and the growth of power generation equipment is far behind. Although the power industry has implemented a series of management and technical reforms to greatly enhance the potential of power generation equipment, it still cannot meet the growing demand for electricity. In 1956, the average utilization rate of power generation equipment nationwide reached 1.7 times that of 1949, which means that the same capacity of power generation equipment could generate 1.7 times the electricity. However, the annual electricity generation increased by about 274% during this period, while the capacity of power generation equipment only increased by 94%, which is the main reason for the current tight electricity supply.
    Electricity is mainly used in industrial production. Therefore, the growth rate of electricity generation should have an appropriate ratio to the growth of the total industrial output value. In many industrially advanced countries around the world, the amount of electricity used in many industrial production processes is constantly increasing to improve production efficiency and product quality. Furthermore, the degree of mechanization and automation is constantly increasing, so the growth rate of electricity generation generally exceeds the growth rate of the total industrial output value. Moreover, the amount of electricity that power generation equipment can generate is limited by the rated capacity of the machines. In order to ensure the high reliability of power supply and meet the increased electricity needs of various industrial sectors that may exceed the planned targets, the growth of power generation equipment capacity must be faster than the growth of electricity generation. The following figures from the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan illustrate this point. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the total industrial output value will increase by 65%, the total power generation will increase by 88%, and the total capacity of power generation equipment will need to increase by 120%.
    When formulating China's First Five-Year Plan, due to our lack of construction experience and insufficient estimation of the potential of industrial production, and due to the limitations of national investment and equipment supply, we did not prepare enough equipment capacity to meet the electricity needs of various industrial sectors exceeding the planned targets. By 1956, the total national industrial output value had exceeded the targets for 1957 in the First Five-Year Plan, and the output of major products such as steel, cement, cotton yarn, paper, and caustic soda had all exceeded the First Five-Year Plan. However, the annual increase in power generation equipment in the power industry was basically carried out according to the Five-Year Plan. Therefore, it could not meet the needs of the unplanned growth of industrial electricity consumption, resulting in the current electricity shortage. This experience is worth our attention when formulating the Second Five-Year Plan. The report by Vice Premier Li Fuchun mentioned that先行 [xiānxíng – to proceed in advance of others] industries such as electricity must develop more, which is completely correct.
    Another aspect of the coordination between electricity and industry is the mutual coordination of factory locations. Although the electricity supply is very tight in most regions, there are also individual regions where new power plants have been built, but the factories originally planned to be built have not been built as planned, or the plans have been changed and factories have been built elsewhere, so that the newly built power generation equipment cannot be fully utilized. And the area to which the factory has moved has not arranged in advance for the increased electricity it needs. At present, the power system has not been widely established nationwide, and areas with surplus electricity cannot transmit electricity to areas with power shortages, resulting in the phenomenon that many areas are short of electricity while some areas have excess electricity. This illustrates the necessity of close coordination between the factory construction plans of the industrial and power industries. On the one hand, the power industry must appropriately arrange the construction plans of power plants and power systems according to the deployment of industry. On the other hand, industries that require a large amount of electricity should, to the extent possible, be located close to the location of power resources, depending on the distribution of power resources; once the construction site has been decided, it should not be changed unless absolutely necessary.
  (2) The Coordination of the Power Industry and the Machine Manufacturing Industry
    Some people ask, since domestic companies can manufacture 6,000 kW and 12,000 kW power generation equipment, why not use them as much as possible to help solve the problem of electricity shortage? The principle of "fully utilizing the technical equipment that our country can now manufacture" is beyond doubt, and in fact the power industry is doing so. The power industry has already been or is using a large number of domestically produced 6,000 kW and 12,000 kW power generation equipment. Of course, there are specific difficulties. A power plant equipped with a unit machine capacity of 6,000 kW will require 80% more investment and more than twice the amount of steel and cement than a power plant with the same total capacity but equipped with a unit machine capacity of 12,000 kW. Due to the limitations of national investment and the supply of steel and cement, it is impossible to install more small machines. The problem does not stop there. The machine capacity needs to match the size of the power system, and large systems need to be equipped with large machines. For example, the Northeast system now has a total power generation equipment capacity of 1.5 million kW, which will reach 3 million kW by 1962. It is not very reasonable to install 50,000 kW machines now, and 100,000 kW machines should be installed. Taking the Liaoning Power Plant as an example, the final design capacity is 600,000 kW, and it is planned to install eight 50,000 kW machines and two 100,000 kW machines. If all 6,000 kW machines are installed, 100 units will be needed, and 50 units will be needed even if 12,000 kW machines are installed. Installing 6,000 kW machines will not only increase investment by more than 400 million, but also be impossible in terms of technology and management. At present, the Northeast power system has to install 250,000 kW of power generation capacity every year. If small machines are installed, the civil construction force will not be able to keep up under any circumstances. Currently, China has to install 600,000 to 700,000 kW of thermal power generation equipment every year, and it will double in five years. If the capacity of the units is not increased as much as possible, the country's requirements for the growth of electricity supply will not be met in terms of steel, cement supply, machine manufacturing, and infrastructure construction. As for the use of high-pressure and high-temperature equipment, the purpose is to obtain economic results. Machines with 90 atmospheres of pressure can generally save 14%-16% of coal compared to machines with 35 atmospheres of pressure. Taking a 600,000 kW power plant as an example, installing high-pressure machines instead of medium-pressure machines will save about 300,000 tons of standard coal per year. Of course, this issue must also be considered in conjunction with machine size, domestic manufacturing level, and steel-coal price ratio, and the economy of coal consumption cannot be simply pursued. However, China's coal supply is still relatively tight. Installing high-pressure and high-temperature machines in some power plants to save fuel in the long term is still necessary to balance the fuel supply and reduce the burden of railway transportation.
    The domestic machine manufacturing industry is working hard to design and trial-produce large-capacity and high-pressure and high-temperature equipment. 25,000 kW units will be manufactured in 1958, and the trial production of 50,000 kW units will be completed in 1960. As for steel, except for large forgings, the steel required for medium-pressure machines can currently be produced domestically, and pearlite steel required for high-pressure equipment is also planned to be produced domestically in 1959. Therefore, producing high-pressure, high-temperature, and larger units is no longer a problem. The problem is that there is currently a large domestic demand for 25,000, 50,000, and 100,000 kW machines, and the demand and supply have been disconnected for four or five years. How to solve this contradiction? I think the direction to solve this problem is to follow the principle instructed by Vice Premier Li Fuchun: "A few of the most important newly built enterprises should adopt advanced or even the most advanced technology. The generally newly built and renovated enterprises should fully utilize the technical equipment that our country can now manufacture... The machine manufacturing department must strive to design and manufacture advanced products..." According to this principle, on the one hand, the power industry should use domestically manufactured equipment as much as possible within its capabilities to support the domestic manufacturing industry and prepare conditions for the supply of larger and more advanced equipment. On the other hand, the machine manufacturing department should temporarily not encourage over-planned production of equipment that can already be produced, but take all possible measures to create the necessary conditions to produce 25,000, 50,000, and 100,000 kW machines as early as possible. In some power plants, the most technically advanced equipment should be purchased from abroad (parts that can be manufactured domestically should still be supplied domestically) to train talents, improve technical level, and accumulate operating experience for reference by the domestic manufacturing industry. In terms of the machine manufacturing industry, it is also appropriate to use some foreign exchange to purchase equipment that our country cannot yet manufacture for research and imitation. Doing so is beneficial to the current and long-term interests of the national economy.
    The above two points are just my personal immature opinions, and I hope you will correct me.

    关于电力工业的发展问题
    鲍国宝的发言
    请允许我就下列两个问题发表一点意见。
  （一）工业与电力的配合问题
    目前在全国很多地区内电力供应很紧张。主要原因是电力需要量增加得很快，发电设备的增长远远跟不上。虽然电力工业已推行了一系列的管理和技术改革的措施，大大地发挥了发电设备的潜力，但还不能满足用电增长的需要。1956年全国发电设备的平均利用率达到了1949年的一点七倍，这就是说，相等的发电设备容量，要发出一点七倍的电度。但每年发电度数在这个时期内约增加了274％，而发电设备容量仅增加了94％，这就是电力供应紧张的主要原因。
    电力主要是用在工业生产方面，因此，发电度数增长的速度应该与工业总产值的增长，有适当的比例。世界各个工业先进的国家中，在许多工业生产过程内，都不断地提高用电量，以提高生产效率和产品质量，更兼机械化和自动化的程度不断地提高，所以发电量增长的速度一般都要超过工业总产值增长的速度。又发电设备所能发出的电量，要受到机器额定容量的限制。为了保证供电的高度可靠性并满足各工业部门可能超额完成计划所增加的用电需要，发电设备容量的增长又必须比发电度数的增长快些。苏联第六个五年计划的下列几个数字，就可以说明这个问题。在第六个五年计划内，工业总产值要增加65％，电力总产量要增加88％，而发电设备总容量则需要增加120％。
    在制定我国第一个五年计划时，由于我们缺乏建设的经验，对工业生产的潜力估计不足，又由于国家投资和设备供应的限制，没有为满足各工业部门超额完成计划所需的电力准备好设备容量。到1956年，全国工业总产值已超过了第一个五年计划1957年的指标，钢铁、水泥、棉纱、纸和烧碱等主要产品的产量都已超额完成第一个五年计划。但是电力工业逐年发电设备的增加，基本上还是按照五年计划进行的，因此，就满足不了工业用电超计划增长的需要，造成当前的缺电情况。在制定第二个五年计划时，这个经验值得我们重视。李富春副总理的报告中，提到电力等先行工业必须多发展一点，这是完全正确的。
    电力与工业的配合问题的另一方面，是建厂地点的相互配合。虽然在大多数地区内，目前电力供应非常紧张，但也有个别地区，新发电站已建立，而原来计划建设的工厂未按计划兴建，或改变计划，另在别处建厂，以致新建的发电设备不能充分利用。而该工厂所迁到的地区，又没有预先安排其所需要增加的电量。现在电力系统尚未在全国范围内广泛建立，有多余电力的地区不能向缺电的地区送电，以致存在着不少地区缺电而个别地区电多的现象。这说明了工业和电力工业的建厂计划密切配合的必要性。一方面，电力工业要根据工业的部署适当地安排发电站和电力系统的建设计划。另一方面，需要大量电力的工业，也要根据动力资源的分布，在建厂可能的条件下，尽量与动力资源所在地靠近；已决定的建厂地点，则非绝对必要时不宜变更。
  （二）电力工业与机器制造工业的配合问题
    有人问，国内已能制造六千和一点二万瓩发电设备，为什么不尽量利用，来帮助解决缺电的问题呢？“充分利用我国现在能制造的技术装备”的原则，毋可置疑，在事实上电力工业也是这样做的。电力工业已经或者正在大量采用国内生产的六千和一点二万瓩发电设备。当然，具体困难是有的。一个装置了单位机组容量为六千瓩的发电站，比较总容量相同、但装置了单位机组容量为一点二万瓩的发电站，所花投资要增加80％，使用的钢材和水泥也要增加一倍以上。由于国家投资和钢材、水泥供应的限制，就不可能多装置小机器。问题还不止此，机器容量需要配合电力系统的大小，大的系统就要装置大的机器。例如东北系统，现在发电设备总容量已达到一百五十万瓩，到1962年要达到三百万瓩，现在装置五万瓩机器已不很合理，应该装置十万瓩的机器。以辽宁发电站来讲，设计最终容量为六十万瓩，准备装置五万瓩机八台和十万瓩机两台。如果全部装置六千瓩机，需要一百台，装置一点二万瓩机也需要五十台。装置六千瓩机非但在投资上要增多四亿以上，就是在技术上和管理上也是不可能的。现在东北电力系统每年要装置发电容量二十五万瓩，如果装置小机器，土建力量就无论如何赶不上。目前我国每年要装置六十——七十万瓩火力发电设备，五年后还要增加一倍。如果不尽可能地加大机组的容量，无论在钢材、水泥供应、机器制造和基建工程各方面，都要远远不能满足国家对于电力供应增长的要求。至于使用高压高温的设备，目的在于求得经济的效果，九十大气压的机器，比较三十五大气压的机器，一般可以省煤14％—16％。按六十万瓩的发电站来说，装置高压机器比中压机器，每年要节省标准煤约三十万吨。当然这问题也要结合机器大小、国内制造水平和钢煤比价等问题来考虑，不能单纯地追求用煤的经济。但目前我国煤的供应还是比较紧张，在若干发电站内装置高压高温机器，以长期地节省燃料，对于平衡燃料的供应和减轻铁路运输的负担，还是很必要的。
    国内机器制造工业正在努力设计和试制大容量和高压高温的设备。1958年就可制成二点五万瓩机组，1960年将要完成五万瓩机组的试制工作。至于钢材方面，中压机器所需钢材，除大锻件外，目前国内已能自产，而高压设备所需珠光体钢也准备在1959年自行生产。因此，生产高压、高温、较大机组已不是问题，问题在于目前国内已需要大量的二点五万、五万和十万瓩机器，需要和供应之间脱节了四、五年。如何解决这个矛盾呢？我认为解决的方向，就是遵照李富春副总理所指示的原则：“少数最重要的新建企业，要搞先进的以至最先进的技术。一般的新建改建企业要充分利用我国现在能制造的技术装备，……机器制造部门必须努力设计和制造先进的产品……”根据这个原则，一方面，电力工业应该在可能范围内尽量使用国内能制造的设备，以扶植国内制造工业，为供应更大、更先进的设备准备条件。另一方面，机器制造部门对于已经能生产的设备，暂时不鼓励超计划生产，而采取一切可能的措施，创造必要的条件，提早生产二点五万、五万和十万瓩机器。在若干发电站中，要向国外购置技术上最先进的设备（国内能制造的部分，仍争取由国内供应）以培养人才，提高技术水平并积累运行经验来供国内制造工业的参考。在机器制造工业方面，也宜用一部分外汇，购买我国还不能制造的设备，以供研究和仿造。这样做，对于国民经济目前的和长远的利益都是有利的。
    以上两点，仅是我个人不成熟的意见，希望各位指正。
