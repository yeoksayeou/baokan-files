    The Coal Sea Under Construction – Pingdingshan
    The "Coal Sea" of Pingdingshan, spanning over 1,000 square kilometers and containing reserves of over 15 billion tons of coal, is being accelerated in its construction. Currently, four pairs of modern large and medium-sized vertical shafts are under full-scale construction throughout the mining area. Among them, the No. 2 vertical shaft is expected to be officially put into production in the fourth quarter of this year.

    建设中的煤海——平顶山
    纵横一千多平方公里、储藏有一百五十多亿吨煤的“煤海”——平顶山，正在加速建设中。现在，全矿区已有四对现代化的大、中型竖井正在进行全面施工，其中的二号竖井到今年第四季度就可以正式投入生产。
    左图：我国自己设计的五号竖井将是我国目前年产量最大的竖井之一。它的大部分设备是我国自己制造的。图为五号竖井工地。
    下图：长达八十多公里的铁路线已开始通行火车。大批的建筑物资源源运到工地。
