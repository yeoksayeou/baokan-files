    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 4th - Our correspondent reports from Surabaya that President Sukarno, in a speech at a mass rally in Surabaya on the afternoon of the 2nd, once again pointed out the necessity of establishing a National Council and a cooperative cabinet.
    President Sukarno was in Surabaya to attend the Indonesian National Youth Week celebration. Upon his arrival in Surabaya, tens of thousands of people lined the route from the airport to near the East Java Governor's Office to warmly welcome him. A mass rally of 200,000 people was then held at the Heroes' Monument Square in front of the Governor's Office. This rally was organized by the Surabaya Committee for Supporting the Sukarno Plan.
    The President said at the rally that he makes no distinction between internal and external affairs. If people do not make distinctions between each other in foreign affairs (that is, do not lean towards a particular bloc), but make clear distinctions between each other on domestic issues, this is illogical.
    He said that some people say he has changed and is leading the people to the left. He said that he has not changed, and he has always advocated national unity.
    He expressed his disagreement with the views of some people that instead of establishing a National Council, it would be better to organize an informal advisory committee, as in the Yogyakarta era, to make general recommendations to the cabinet. He said that the situation is different now. At that time, people were united, but now they are divided.
    It is believed that the President's remarks were a response to the views of former Vice President Hatta. In an article published on the 2nd, Hatta said that he believes the implementation of the Sukarno Plan would encounter "various insurmountable difficulties and contradictions," and he does not agree with the establishment of a National Council and a cooperative cabinet including the Indonesian Communist Party.
    After attending the mass rally, the President received thirty delegations from various parts of East Java, who expressed their support for his plan.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 4th - The Masyumi Party, the Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association, the Indonesian Islamic League Party, the Catholic Party, and the Indonesian People's Party issued a statement after a meeting on the 2nd, saying that they cannot accept the President's plan.
    They believe that the issue of fundamentally changing the national political system, as advocated in the President's plan, must be discussed by the Constitutional Assembly.
    They acknowledge that Sukarno's idea of finding a way out of the country's current difficult situation is good, but they also say that this "good intention has been misused by some parties," making it difficult to achieve its purpose.

### 苏加诺在泗水群众大会上发表演说  重申成立民族委员会和合作内阁的必要性  马斯友美党等党派声明不能接受苏加诺方案

    苏加诺在泗水群众大会上发表演说
    重申成立民族委员会和合作内阁的必要性
    马斯友美党等党派声明不能接受苏加诺方案
    据新华社雅加达4日电  本社记者从泗水报道，苏加诺总统2日下午在泗水群众大会上发表演说，再一次指出成立民族委员会和合作内阁的必要性。
    苏加诺总统是到泗水出席印度尼西亚全国青年联欢周的。当他到达泗水时，成千成万人民群众从飞机场一直排到东爪哇省长公署附近热烈地欢迎他。然后在公署前面的烈士纪念碑广场上举行了二十万人的群众大会。这个大会是由泗水拥护苏加诺方案委员会主持的。
    总统在大会上说，不论对内或对外他都不分彼此。如果人们对外不分彼此（就是不倒向某一个集团），而对国内问题却分清彼此，这是不合乎逻辑的。
    他说，有人说他变了，要把人民引向左倾。他说，他没有变，他一直主张民族团结。
    他表示不能同意某些人的说法，即与其成立民族委员会，不如像日惹时代那样，只组织一个非正式的谘询委员会，向内阁提出普通建议。他说，情况不同了。那时人们是团结的，而现在是分裂的。
    人们认为，总统这段话是答复前副总统哈达的意见的。哈达在2日发表的文章中说，他认为实现苏加诺方案会遇到“各种难以克服的困难和矛盾”，他不同意成立民族委员会和包括印度尼西亚共产党在内的合作内阁。
    总统在出席群众大会以后，接见了来自东爪哇各地的三十个代表团，这些代表团向总统表示支持他的方案。
    新华社雅加达4日电  马斯友美党、伊斯兰教师联合会、印度尼西亚伊斯兰联盟党、天主教党和印度尼西亚人民党2日在举行会议后发表声明说，他们不能接受总统方案。
    他们认为，总统方案中所主张的从根本上改变国家政治制度的问题，必须由制宪议会去讨论。
    他们承认，苏加诺要从国家目前的困难处境中找寻出路的想法是好的，但是他们又说，这个“良好意念已经被某些方面所误用”，因而它的目的就难于达到。
