    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 30th. According to a report by the German News Agency, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) held its 31st meeting on March 29th. Fred Ulbricht, on behalf of the Political Bureau of the SED Central Committee, delivered a report at the meeting, which paid particular attention to the issue of unity of action of the German working class.

    Ulbricht pointed out that since the 30th plenary session of the Party Central Committee was held two months ago, progress has been made in the unity of action of the German working class. He mentioned that the recent All-German Workers' Conference in Leipzig had called for the establishment of the unity of the entire German working class as a prerequisite for solving the tasks of restoring German unity and achieving peace. In addition, at the recent meetings between leading cadres of the SED and members and cadres of the Social Democratic Party, complete agreement was also reached on the issue of the highest responsibility of the German workers' parties. He believes that despite differences of opinion on certain issues, it is possible for the SED to reach understanding and cooperation with the Social Democratic Party.

    At the same time, Ulbricht criticized the anti-communist attitude of the Social Democratic Party leaders. He pointed out that this attitude is an obstacle to establishing unity of action.

    厄斯纳在德国统一社会党中央全会上作报告
    强调德国工人阶级行动一致
    据新华社柏林30日电　据德意志通讯社报道，德国统一社会党中央委员会在3月29日举行了第三十一次会议。弗雷德·厄斯纳代表德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局，在会上作报告，这个报告特别注意德国工人阶级行动一致的问题。
    厄斯纳指出，自从两个月以前举行党中央第三十次全体会议以来，在德国工人阶级行动一致方面已经取得了进展。他提到最近在来比锡举行的全德工人会议曾经要求建立整个德国工人阶级的团结，作为解决恢复德国统一和取得和平的任务的先决条件。此外，在德国统一社会党领导干部和社会民主党党员和干部最近举行的会议上，也曾就德国工人政党最高的责任问题取得了完全一致的意见。他认为尽管在某些问题上意见有分歧，但是德国统一社会党同社会民主党取得谅解和合作是可能的。
    同时厄斯纳批评了社会民主党领袖们的反共态度。他指出，这种态度是建立行动一致的障碍。
