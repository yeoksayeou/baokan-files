Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, March 13th: On the Xiamen Island, the forefront of the motherland's coastal defense, spring ploughing production is in full swing. Agricultural cooperative members are in the fields in groups of three or five, busy sowing and harvesting. The roads are filled with ox carts carrying vegetables and fertilizer. Only when the Chiang Kai-shek troops shell do the farmers, carrying their farm tools and leading their oxen, run into the anti-artillery trenches and anti-artillery caves beside the fields and roads to rest. They cheer for the powerful counter-fire of our army and mock the blind shelling of the Chiang Kai-shek troops.

This year, spring harvesting and spring planting on Xiamen Island are particularly busy. The total area of spring-harvested crops on the island is more than 30,000 mu, accounting for 55% of the cultivated area, an increase of 10% over last year, and the yield has also increased by about 30%. With the help of manpower and horses from the PLA coastal defense troops, spring-harvested crops are harvested as soon as they are ripe. Although the spring ploughing and spring planting targets are higher than last year, the progress is faster. It is expected that rice transplanting can begin about ten days earlier than last year by early April.

The Xiamen Island front line is only 5,200 to 16,500 meters away from the Kinmen Islands occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, and is often harassed by Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft and artillery. Under the protection of the PLA coastal defense troops, the vast number of farmers here continue to engage in production as usual. The output of various crops on the island reached and exceeded the highest level before liberation in 1953. After the realization of advanced agricultural cooperation last year, another unprecedented bumper harvest was achieved, and the average income of cooperative members increased by about 30% compared with 1955. It is estimated that the total output value of agriculture and sideline industries this year will increase by more than a quarter compared with last year. (Attached picture)

    厦门前线春耕生产热火朝天
    据新华社厦门13日电  祖国海防前哨的厦门岛上，春耕生产热火朝天。农业社社员们在田野上三五成群地忙着播种和收获。公路上到处是满载蔬菜、肥料往来的牛车。只在蒋军打炮的时候，农民们才带着农具、拉着耕牛跑进田边和路旁的防炮沟、防炮洞里休息。他们一面为我军强大的还击炮火欢呼，一面嘲笑蒋军盲目打炮。
    今年，厦门岛上春收春种显得特别忙碌。全岛春收作物共三万多亩，占耕地面积55％，比去年扩大了10％，产量也比去年增加三成左右。在解放军海防部队抽出人力和马匹帮助下，春收作物做到了随熟随收。春耕春种的指标虽然比去年高，进度却更快了。预计到4月上旬，可以比去年提早十天左右开始插秧。
    厦门岛前沿，与蒋军盘踞的大小金门岛相距只有五千二百多公尺到一万六千五百公尺，经常遭受蒋军飞机、大炮的袭扰。这里的广大农民在解放军海防部队保卫下，照常进行生产。全岛的各种农作物产量，在1953年就达到和超过解放前最高水平。去年实现农业高级合作化以后，又获得了空前丰收，社员平均收入比1955年增加三成左右。预计今年农副业总产值将比去年增加四分之一以上。（附图片）
