Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th. TASS reports: The Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union held a plenary session on the 26th and 27th, and adopted a resolution on improving the ideological education work of the Komsomol organization among young people.

    The resolution pointed out that the younger generation of the Soviet Union has made many selfless labors in the construction of the national economy in the struggle to build communism.

    The resolution said that the main shortcoming of the ideological education work of many Komsomol organizations is that this ideological education work is often divorced from the practice of communist construction and does not take into account the requirements of the times, specific conditions and circumstances. Sometimes the League organizations forget that this generation of young people was born, grew up and started working under the conditions of socialism already having won and created very good conditions for cultivating young people. This generation of young people has not experienced harsh revolutionary struggles and training, and has not experienced the hardships and difficulties encountered by the older generation. Some young people do not understand how much sacrifice and blood and sweat was paid to win the conditions they live in today, and they think that the past has always been like today. Some young men and women show dependence on others, they enjoy their rights very well, but they forget their obligations to society; they demand a lot from the country, but contribute very little to the country. In some places, the requirements for young people have been lowered, and individual young people have grown up in greenhouses and cannot withstand the storms of life. Some parents spoil their children, which is harmful to their children and society.

    Many Komsomol organizations have relaxed their attention to the ideological training of young people, have not launched an attack on the conspiracies of bourgeois propaganda, and have done a poor job in cultivating Bolshevik vigilance among young people. They have not done enough in the moral education of young people, and have not waged a vigorous struggle against alcoholism, hooliganism, and the idle lifestyles of some young people.

    The resolution said that the Komsomol should do its best to eliminate these shortcomings. Its task is to cultivate staunchly believing and enthusiastic fighters for the communist cause, true Leninists. Its responsibility is to cultivate young people with profound ideology, infinite loyalty to the socialist motherland, and the spirit of proletarian internationalism; love of labor, collectivism, comradely friendship; help young people establish a modern scientific worldview (atheism) and fight against religious prejudices.

    All ideological work of the Komsomol organization must be closely integrated with the practice of communist construction, and must be subject to the task of successfully completing the historic resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU. It is necessary to conscientiously improve political education, help young people study Marxism-Leninism, and explain to them the doctrines of classes and class struggle, socialist revolution, proletarian dictatorship, the road from capitalism to socialism, national issues, proletarian internationalism, the role of the Party in the struggle for the victory of communism, and socialist democracy.

    The resolution also requires Komsomol organizations to strengthen the ideological education of young people engaged in creative work, help them improve their skills, and oppose literary and artistic works that distort Soviet reality and harm the education of young people; pay more attention to the aesthetic education of young people, help young people establish good hobbies, and care about making all young people have good manners, appearance, and simple and elegant clothing; more widely carry out mass sports activities, and promote environmental and personal hygiene in the daily life of young people.

    The resolution said that improving education work within the Komsomol also means further promoting the initiative and independent activities of Komsomol members, promoting collective discussions and democratic style within the Komsomol, eradicating bureaucracy and over-centralization, and improving the role of each Komsomol member, and improving his sense of responsibility for the work of the League organization.

    The Central Committee of the Soviet Komsomol also advocated holding national and local youth festivals regularly in the future. It called on all League members and young people to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Soviet regime with a new upsurge of socialist competition and with glorious achievements that demonstrate the infinite love of young people for the socialist motherland.

    苏联共青团中央举行全会
    决定改进青年思想教育工作
    使青年成为坚定的共产主义事业的战士
    据新华社28日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会在26日和27日举行全体会议，通过了关于改进共青团组织在青年中的思想教育工作的决议。
    决议指出，苏联青年一代在争取建成共产主义的斗争中，对国民经济建设进行了许多忘我的劳动。
    决议说，许多共青团组织的思想教育工作的主要缺点是，这种思想教育工作常常脱离共产主义建设的实际，没有考虑时代的要求、具体的条件和情况。团组织有时候忘记了，这一代青年是在社会主义已经胜利、已经创造了非常良好的培养青年的条件下诞生、成长和开始劳动的。这一代青年没有经历过严酷的革命斗争和锻炼，没有经受过老一代所遭遇的那种艰苦和困难。部分青年很不了解，他们今天生活的条件是付出怎样的代价、流了多少血汗才争得的，他们认为，过去一直是像今天这样的。有些青年男女表现出依赖人的情绪，他们很好地享受着权利，可是却忘记了对社会的义务；他们向国家要求得很多，而对国家的贡献却很少。某些地方降低了对青年的要求，个别青年人在温室中长大，经不起生活的风霜。还有些父母溺爱青年，贻害了子女和社会。
    许多共青团组织放松了对青年的思想锻炼的注意，没有向资产阶级宣传的阴谋展开进攻，在培养青年具备布尔什维克警惕性方面做得很差。它们对青年的道德教育做得不够，对酗酒、流氓行为、和某些青年人的游手好闲的生活方式没有作有力的斗争。
    决议说，共青团应当全力消除这些缺点。它的任务是培养信仰坚定的和热情奋发的共产主义事业的战士，真正的列宁主义者。它的职责是培养青年具有深刻的思想性、对社会主义祖国的无限忠诚以及无产阶级国际主义精神；热爱劳动，集体主义，同志友爱；帮助青年建立现代的科学世界观（无神论）和同宗教成见作斗争。
    共青团组织的全部思想工作必须密切结合共产主义建设的实践，必须服从胜利完成苏共第二十次代表大会的历史性决议的任务。必须认真改进政治教育，帮助青年研究马克思列宁主义，向他们解释阶级和阶级斗争、社会主义革命、无产阶级专政、从资本主义向社会主义过渡的道路、民族问题、无产阶级国际主义、党在争取共产主义胜利的斗争中的作用以及社会主义民主等方面的学说。
    决议还要求共青团组织加强对从事创作的青年的思想教育工作，帮助他们提高业务，反对那些歪曲苏联现实、危害青年教育工作的文学艺术作品；更多地注意青年的美学教育，帮助青年建立优良的爱好，关心使全体青年具有优良的举止、仪容，衣着朴素雅观；更广泛地开展群众性体育运动，在青年日常生活中提倡环境卫生和个人卫生。
    决议说，改善共青团内的教育工作，还意味着要进一步发扬共青团员的主动性和独立活动，发扬共青团内的集体讨论制和民主作风，根除官僚主义和过分集中的现象，提高每一个共青团员的作用，提高他对团组织工作情况的责任感。
    苏联共青团中央还主张在今后定期举行全国性的和地方性的青年联欢大会。它号召全体团员和青年以新的社会主义竞赛高潮，以表现青年对社会主义祖国无限热爱的光荣业绩来庆祝苏维埃政权建立四十周年。
