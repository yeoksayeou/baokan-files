Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 30th. Newspapers here have published, with extensive coverage, Comrade Khrushchev's report outline "On Further Improving the Organization of Industrial and Construction Management" to be presented at the Supreme Soviet meeting.

The report outline proposes shifting the effective leadership focus of industry and construction to the local level, establishing National Economic Councils in industrially developed states, regions, and republics, and abolishing some corresponding institutions of the USSR Council of Ministers, in order to implement the principle of democratic centralism and vigorously promote the creativity and initiative of the masses and local authorities under the central leadership.

The report outline was decided to be published by the Central Committee of the CPSU and the USSR Council of Ministers. The purpose of the publication is to mobilize the people across the country to engage in discussions, widely exchange opinions, and comprehensively consider existing experiences, thereby studying the most suitable form for managing the Soviet national economy. The outline points out that there are currently more than 200,000 state-owned industrial enterprises and 100,000 construction sites in various parts of the Soviet Union. Given the current scale of production, the current management methods cannot adapt to the growing demands for specific and effective leadership in developing the national economy, and limit the full utilization of the internal potential of the socialist national economic system. Based on the call of the Second Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, the outline proposes changing the existing management organization form, which is managed through the departments and bureaus, into a regional management form; establishing National Economic Councils in industrially developed states, regions, and republics.

The outline states that the National Economic Council will be the basic link in managing industry and construction, and will directly manage the enterprises and construction sites under its jurisdiction according to the tasks stipulated in the national plan for developing the national economy.

The outline points out that the National Economic Council should have all the powers necessary to perform economic and financial functions, and should be fully responsible for the implementation of production plans and the economic results of the work of the enterprises under its jurisdiction. The main work of leading enterprises and construction should be centrally undertaken by the joint enterprises, trusts, and other economic combinations established according to departmental principles under the National Economic Council. The National Economic Council engages in both long-term industrial and construction planning and current industrial and construction planning.

The outline emphasizes that the National Economic Council should work on the basis of widely involving the working people in the management of industrial and construction work. The Councils of Ministers of the Autonomous Republics and the Soviets of the Regions and States should listen to the reports of the Chairmen of the National Economic Councils of their respective economic administrative regions.

The outline believes that adjusting the management of industry and construction requires fundamentally improving the work of the State Planning Committee, so that it can rely on the National Economic Councils of various economic administrative regions in its work and coordinate the work of these committees, and promptly submit the most important issues to the USSR Council of Ministers and the CPSU Central Committee for handling.

The State Planning Committee should become a scientific economic planning institution of the national economy. It should formulate proposals for plans for developing various sectors of the national economy based on the results of research on the needs of the national economy and based on scientific and technological achievements. In addition to the Five-Year Plan, the State Planning Committee must also formulate longer-term perspective plans. The correct proportions between various sectors of the national economy and the development guidelines of various economic regions should be determined according to this plan.

In addition, the outline also suggests giving the State Planning Committee certain powers in order to ensure the implementation of a unified, centralized policy in the development of the most important industrial sectors under various ministries. The USSR State Planning Committee must have certain powers to flexibly resolve issues related to coordinating the work of the National Economic Councils.

The outline believes that under the new circumstances, the existence of the State Economic Commission has lost its significance and should be abolished. Since it is necessary to solve many common problems in domestic construction and design, the State Construction Committee of the USSR Council of Ministers should be retained.

The outline suggests establishing an Engineering and Technical Committee under the USSR Council of Ministers to replace the existing State Technical Committee. The task of this committee is to assist the State Planning Committee and the National Economic Councils in determining the scientific and technical levels necessary when formulating plans for developing various sectors of the national economy, and to take into account the use of the latest scientific and technological achievements in this regard.

Due to the abolition of certain industrial and construction ministries, the composition of the USSR Council of Ministers must be changed. The outline suggests that the Chairmen of the Councils of Ministers of the Union Republics participate in the USSR Council of Ministers.

One section of the outline is specifically devoted to the issue of further expanding the powers of the Union Republics and enhancing their role in economic management. The outline then discussed the issue of enhancing the role of Soviet, Party, and trade union organizations in economic construction and more broadly involving the working people in production management.

The outline concludes: The high-speed development of our national economy and the continuous growth of the people's material welfare are guaranteed by the Party's consistent implementation of the Leninist policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry. If we accept incorrect, specious views and use basic funds to develop the second category of industry, namely the light industrial sectors, although we may see some results quickly and be able to meet certain needs in the short term, this will undermine the foundation of future economic development. This would mean deviating from the only correct Leninist line and would doom the national economy to stagnation.

The outline states that the task facing our country is to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of output per capita. However, these countries are not standing still, but are developing forward under certain conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure the correct ratio of investment in the first and second categories, and to ensure the priority development of heavy industry. The Party has insisted, is insisting, and will continue to insist on this Leninist path of socialist development, which has been tested by the years of experience of the Soviet Union, great China, and the various people's democracies.

    为了改进管理工业和建设的组织工作
    苏联工业建设领导重心准备下移
    苏共中央和部长会议决定公布讨论提纲
    新华社莫斯科30日电　此间各报以大量篇幅发表了赫鲁晓夫同志即将在苏联最高苏维埃会议上作的“关于进一步改进管理工业和建设的组织工作”的报告提纲。
  这个报告提纲建议把工业和建设的有效领导重心转移到地方上去，在工业相当发达的州、边疆区和共和国设立国民经济委员会，撤销苏联部长会议的某些相应机构，以便贯彻民主集中制的原则，大力发扬群众的、以及中央领导下的地方机关的创造性和主动性。
    这个报告提纲是苏共中央和苏联部长会议决定公布的。公布的目的在于发动全国人民进行讨论，广泛交换意见和全面考虑现有的经验，从而研究出管理苏联国民经济的最适合的形式。提纲中指出，目前在苏联各地共有二十万个以上的国营工业企业和十万个建设工地。照现有的生产规模来说，目前的管理方式不能适应具体而有效地领导发展国民经济工作的日益增长的要求，限制了充分利用社会主义国民经济体系内部的潜力。提纲根据苏共二中全会决议的号召，建议把通过主管的部和主管的局、署来管理的现有的管理组织形式，改变为分区管理的形式；在工业相当发达的州、边疆区和共和国设立国民经济委员会。
    提纲说，国民经济委员会将是管理工业和建设的基本环节，将根据发展国民经济的全国计划所规定的任务来直接管理所辖的企业和建设工地。
    提纲指出，国民经济委员会应当拥有执行经济和财政职能所必需的一切权力，应当对生产计划的执行情况、对所辖企业的工作的经济效果负完全责任。领导企业和建设的主要工作应当集中地由国民经济委员会所属的联合企业、托辣斯和其他根据部门原则建立起来的经济组合来担负。国民经济委员会既从事远景的工业和建设的计划工作，也从事当前的工业和建设的计划工作。
    提纲着重指出，国民经济委员会应当在广泛地吸收劳动人民管理工业和建设工作的基础上进行工作。各自治共和国的部长会议以及各边疆区和州的苏维埃应当听取本经济行政区国民经济委员会主席的报告。
    提纲认为，调整工业和建设的管理工作，要求根本改善国家计划委员会的工作，使它在工作中能够依靠各经济行政区的国民经济委员会和协调这些委员会的工作，并且及时地把最重要的问题提交苏联部长会议和苏共中央处理。
    国家计划委员会应当成为国家国民经济的科学的经济计划机构。它应当根据对国民经济需求的研究结果，根据科学技术成就制定出发展国民经济各部门的计划的建议。除了五年计划以外，国家计划委员会还必须制定更长期的远景计划。国民经济各部门之间的正确的比例以及各个经济区域的发展方针就应当根据这种计划来确定。
    另外，提纲还建议给国家计划委员会某些职权，以便在发展各部现有的最重要的工业部门时保证实行统一的、集中的政策。苏联国家计划委员会必须要有一定的权力来灵活地解决有关协调各国民经济委员会工作的问题。
    提纲认为，在新的情况下，国家经济委员会的存在已经失去意义，应予撤销。由于必须解决国内建筑和设计上的许多共同问题，仍须保留苏联部长会议国家建设委员会。
    提纲建议在苏联部长会议下设立工程技术委员会，以代替现有的国家技术委员会。这个委员会的任务是协助国家计划委员会和各国民经济委员会确定在制定发展国民经济各部门计划时所必需的科学技术水平，并且在这方面考虑到利用最新的科学和技术成就。
    由于撤销了某些工业和建设的部，苏联部长会议的组成必须改变。提纲建议让各加盟共和国的部长会议主席参加苏联部长会议。
    提纲中有一个部分专门谈到进一步扩大加盟共和国的职权和提高它在管理经济方面的作用的问题。提纲随后又谈到了提高苏维埃、党和工会组织在经济建设中的作用和更加广泛地吸引劳动人民参加生产管理工作的问题。
    提纲最后说：我国国民经济的高速度发展和人民物质福利的不断增长之所以得到保障，是由于党一贯实行优先发展重工业的列宁主义方针。如果接受不正确的、似是而非的见解和把基本资金用于发展工业第二部类、即轻工业各部门，虽然可能很快看到一些成绩，能够保证在短期内满足某些需要，但是这样将会破坏今后经济发展的基础。这将意味着背离唯一正确的列宁主义路线，并注定国家经济要走向停滞。
    提纲中说，我们国家面临的任务是：在按人口计算产量方面赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家。但是这些国家也并不是停留不前的，而是在一定的条件下向前发展的。因此，必须保证对第一部类和第二部类的投资的正确比例，保证优先发展重工业。党过去、现在和将来都坚持这个经过苏联、伟大的中国和各人民民主国家多年经验所考验的列宁主义的社会主义发展道路。
