　　Xinhua News Agency, Yanji, 26th: Every city and larger town in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture now has factories of varying sizes. According to statistics from the Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee, the prefecture already has twenty-two state-owned and eighty-five local state-owned industrial enterprises. The total industrial output value has accounted for more than 75% of the total industrial and agricultural output value of the Autonomous Prefecture. Among them, the proportion of production materials has risen from 68% in 1949 to 86%.
    Yanbian's industry has developed from small to large and from nothing to something after liberation. The Yanbian Farm Tool Factory was originally a blacksmith shop and a small cart-making shop in the early days of liberation. Now it can produce thousands of new-style farm tools every year, and some paddy field farm tools have been sold to more than a dozen provinces in the country. The small hosiery workshop a few years ago has now become a factory that produces more than 500,000 dozens of knitwear annually. The Yanbian Rubber Factory was relocated from Shenyang by the state to take care of the special needs of the Korean people. It can produce more than 1.7 million pairs of rubber shoes specially needed by the Korean people every year, and some products are also sold to other Korean settlements in Northeast China.

　　延边城城有工厂
    新华社延吉26日电  延边朝鲜族自治州每一个城市和较大的市镇，现在都有规模大小不等的工厂。据自治州人民委员会的统计，全州已有二十二个国营和八十五个地方国营的工业企业，工业总产值已占自治州工农业总产值的75％强。其中生产资料的生产比重，已从1949年的68％上升到86％。
    延边的工业，是在解放后从小到大，从无到有发展起来的。延边农具厂在解放初期原是一个铁匠炉和制造马车的小铺，现在每年能出产上千台新式农具，部分水田农具已销到国内的十多个省。几年前的织袜小作坊，现在也已经成为年产五十多万打针织品的工厂。延边橡胶厂是国家为了照顾朝鲜族人民的特殊需要从沈阳迁来的，每年能出产一百七十多万双朝鲜族特需的胶鞋，部分产品还销到东北的其他朝鲜族聚居区。
