Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 16th. The sixth pier of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the only one that had not reached the designed elevation, completed its final work today to reach the required height. With this, the entire pier project of the Yangtze River Bridge is complete. Now, from afar, one can see the eight towering piers standing like giants in the rapid currents of the Yangtze River, forcing the turbulent floodwaters to obediently flow around them.

The pier project is the most important and most difficult part of bridge construction. Building a bridge over the Yangtze River in Wuhan presents even greater challenges due to the particularly complex hydrological and geological conditions here. The old pier construction methods popular around the world are difficult or impossible to apply here. After joint research and experimentation by Chinese and Soviet bridge builders, the "large-diameter pipe pile drilling method" was successfully created, attracting widespread attention both at home and abroad. Throughout the construction of the pier project, this new method extraordinarily solved various problems that were unthinkable with the old methods, enabling the entire pier project to be completed in a year and a half, with excellent quality and low cost.

In order to continuously accelerate the progress of the project while ensuring safety and quality, Chinese and Soviet engineers and workers worked diligently. Wind, snow, sun, and rain could not stop their construction enthusiasm. They ensured that the pier project never stopped, even under the most difficult conditions. In a year and a half, people proposed hundreds and thousands of rationalization suggestions and trial-produced several kinds of high-power construction machines that did not exist in any other country in the world. Every quarter, hundreds of workers, engineers, technicians, and managers were selected as advanced producers or workers. Many of them attended the labor model representative conferences or advanced producer representative meetings in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and the entire country.

Through a series of practical exercises and training, thousands of technical and management personnel capable of skillfully working according to the requirements of the new method have grown up during the pier project construction. Most of these people were originally students who had just left school, apprentices who had just started learning bridge construction, and cadres who had just been transferred from other work departments. The original veteran engineers, technicians and workers also made significant improvements during the same period. Now, this group of talents has become a valuable asset to China's bridge engineering field, and many bridges across the country will be built by them. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge pier project was fully completed on March 16. (Attached image)

    长江大桥桥墩全部建成
    桥墩工程进度快、质量好、造价低廉
    中苏桥梁建设者创造的新施工方法引起中外广泛注意
    新华社武汉16日电　武汉长江大桥唯一没有达到设计标高的第六号桥墩，已经在今天作完了达到标高所需的最后工作。整个长江大桥的桥墩工程到此全部完工。现在，人们老远地就可以看到：八个高大的桥墩像巨人似地矗立在长江的激流中，迫使滚滚洪水驯服地从自己的身边流过。
    桥墩工程是桥梁建筑中最重要和最难作的部分。而在武汉长江上建桥，由于这里水文地质情况特别复杂，建筑桥墩的困难也就更加突出。在这里，世界上流行的几种修筑桥墩的旧方法，都是很难或根本不能适用的。经过中苏桥梁建设者的共同研究和试验以后，创造成功了已经引起中外人士广泛注意的“大型管柱钻孔法”。在整个桥墩工程的施工过程中，这种新方法出奇地解决了各种各样的对旧方法说来是不能设想的问题，使桥墩工程在一年半的时间内全部完工，而且质量很好，造价低廉。
    为了在保证安全和质量的基础上不断加速工程进度，中苏工程师和工人们曾经进行过艰苦的劳动。风吹、雪打、日晒、雨淋，都挡不住他们的建设热情，他们使桥墩工程在最困难的条件下也从未中断过。一年半的时间内，人们提出了成百上千条的合理化建议，并且试制出了好多种在世界各国都还没有的功率极高的施工机具。每个季度，都有数以百计的工人、工程技术人员和管理干部，被评选为先进生产者或工作者，他们中有不少人并且先后出席过武汉市、湖北省和全国的劳动模范代表大会或先进生产者代表会议。
    经过一系列的实际锻炼和培养，在桥墩工程建设过程中，有数以千计的能够熟练地根据新方法的要求进行工作的技术管理人材成长起来了。这些人中，绝大部分原来都是刚离开学校的学生、刚学习桥梁建筑的学徒工和刚从其他工作部门调来的干部。原来的老工程技术人员和工人，在同一时期内也有显著的提高。现在，这批人材已经成为我国桥梁工程界的宝贵财富，全国有许多桥梁将由他们来承建。武汉长江大桥桥墩工程已在3月16日全部完工。（附图片）
