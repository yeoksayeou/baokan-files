　　Serving Industrial and Agricultural Construction
　　Civil Aviation Administration Increases Specialized Flight Missions

　　(Our Newspaper's dispatch) The Civil Aviation Administration of China has completed the production preparations for specialized aviation in 1957, and various specialized flights serving industrial and agricultural construction are about to be fully launched.

　　According to the specialized flight plans negotiated by the Civil Aviation Administration and the forestry, geology, agriculture, and other departments, the task this year has increased compared to last year in terms of flight hours. In addition to the forest fire prevention in the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains in Northeast China during the spring and autumn seasons this year, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou and other provinces will also use aircraft for forest fire prevention for the first time on more than 200,000 square kilometers of forests; the workload of aerial surveys and aerial measurements has increased by 42.8% compared to last year. Forest surveys will be conducted in the Lesser Khingan Mountains, Wanda Mountains, Qinling Mountains, and Daba Mountains. Aerial surveys will be used in the Tianshan Mountains, Qilian Mountains, and the Yellow River Hetao area, as well as for the planning work of Beijing. In order to expand geological prospecting flights, the Ministry of Geology and the Civil Aviation Administration have jointly expanded the original three geophysical prospecting teams to five teams. One of the teams persisted in exploration flights in Northeast China, East China and other places even in difficult winter conditions. From mid-March, other teams will search for underground mineral deposits in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the Qinling Mountains, and the Nanling Mountains. This year, the area of aerial prospecting will increase by about 70% compared to last year. In addition, the area of aircraft locust and pest control serving agriculture will be over three million mu.

　　In order to safely and overfulfill this year's specialized flight tasks, the Civil Aviation Administration's specialized aviation team spent three months last winter conducting a comprehensive summary and reorganization of the organization. At the same time, the masses discussed this year's production plan and put forward the guarantee conditions for labor competition.

　　为工农业建设服务
　　民航局增加专业飞行任务
    本报讯　中国民用航空局已经完成1957年度专业航空的生产准备工作，为工农业建设服务的各种专业飞行即将全面展开。
    根据民航局和林业、地质、农业等部门商订的专业飞行计划，按飞行小时计算，今年的任务比去年又有增加。今年春秋两季的航空护林除在东北大小兴安岭地区进行外，四川、云南和贵州等省也有二十多万平方公里的森林首次试用飞机护林；航空调查和航空测量的工作量比去年增加42.8％。小兴安岭、完达山、秦岭、大巴山一带都将进行森林调查，天山、祁连山和黄河河套地区以及北京市规划工作都将采用航空测量；为了扩大地质探矿飞行，地质部跟民航局协同把原有的三个地球物理探矿队扩充为五个队，其中有一个队在冬季困难情况下，仍坚持在东北、华东等地进行勘探飞行；其他各队从3月中旬起将分别在长江中下游、秦岭、南岭寻找地下矿藏，今年航空探矿面积比去年增加约70％。此外，为农业服务的飞机灭蝗灭虫的面积将在三百万亩以上。
    为了安全超额完成今年的专业飞行任务，民航局专业航空队去年冬季曾用三个月的时间进行全面总结和整顿组织的工作，同时在群众中讨论了今年的生产计划并提出劳动竞赛的保证条件。
