    Brothers
    "Diary of Returning Home" (Part 1)
    Lü Jianzhong
    At the end of the lunar year, the train on the Jiaoji Railway was very crowded, and many passengers had no seats and stood in the carriages. But everyone was in a good mood, thinking about the joy of the Spring Festival and reuniting with their loved ones. At each station, the passengers getting off the train would stretch their backs and say in a relaxed tone, "Ah, home at last!" The passengers who were not getting off would also like to add, "Maybe your mother is waiting for you at the entrance of the village!"
    Sitting across from me, Lu Yuming, whenever he saw this situation, would just smile with envious eyes, then look out the window and ponder. He gave me a very good impression. As soon as we set off from Jinan, we had a very interesting conversation, but it was all about his experiences in the Mongolian People's Republic. At first, his appearance was a bit striking—a grass-green cotton-padded jacket, beige cotton trousers, all machine-sewn with small plaid patterns, a long-billed melon-skin hat on his head, and a pair of black high-top leather boots. Judging from the wrinkled face, he was a hardworking person who had experienced the vicissitudes of life, but his deep eyes, and the fancy gold pen, pencil, and watch he wore, made him look like a very intelligent engineer. I first asked him where he came from, and he replied with a stern face, word by word: "From Ulaanbaatar, the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic." Later, he gradually relaxed his tone. He said he was originally a bricklayer from Changchun City. In 1952, when the higher authorities called for people to assist in the construction of the Mongolian People's Republic, he signed up and went to Ulaanbaatar with more than three thousand construction workers from Changchun. Like the Soviet engineers and the Mongolian worker brothers, he worked in the wind and rain all day long. Building after building, road after road were built. He then transferred to the rural areas near Ulaanbaatar to help residents dig wells and build houses. In the past, the local residents lived in yurts and had to transport water by car from hundreds of miles away. Soviet experts helped them study how to dig wells with iron pipes and bring up groundwater from dozens of feet underground, solving the problem of drinking water for the local residents. Lu Yuming was not used to that kind of life at first, such as the unpredictable climate and always boiling mutton and beef in large pots, but he gradually got used to it. He felt that the Mongolian people were strong, honest, and very lovable, and that being able to help the Mongolian brothers build socialism was the most glorious thing in his life.
    However, emotionally, his longing for his hometown was no less than anyone else's. He said he was fifty years old this year and had never been married, so who was he missing? I knew very well that the people from my hometown who had left their homes to make a living in the Northeast before liberation mostly had their own unfortunate experiences. So, when Lu Yuming was looking out the window and pondering, I asked him, "How many years has it been since you went home?"
   "Hmm! It's been almost fourteen years."
   "Who is at home?"
   "I have brothers and nephews."
   "Then they might meet you at the station; it's been ten years since you separated."
   "That, probably not. It's snowing, the road is not easy to walk, and my home is seven or eight li away from Lancun Station."
   "Why do you only come home to see them once every ten years or so?"
    This time, Lu Yuming didn't answer me immediately. He lowered his head and smiled softly. Then, looking at my face, he said thoughtfully, "Comrade, we are from the same hometown, let me tell you, this time I go home, I feel both sad and happy. I am a poor man. When my father died, he only left us brothers three rooms, five mu of land, and a broken scale for selling tofu. Less than three years after my father died, my brother's wife wanted my brother and me to divide the family. At that time, I was hot-tempered, and I thought, they don't need me anymore, they want me to go out and wash dishes and clean pots. As the saying goes, old ginger is spicier, and younger sons are better. My younger brother was twenty years old, and my father took on debt to get him married, but at that time I was over thirty and still single. I was narrow-minded, and I only felt wronged, so I was not happy about the division of the family. The two brothers argued for several days over those few acres of barren land, and later even started fighting. In a fit of anger, I picked up the iron hammer of the scale that my father left behind and hit him in the face, causing blood to flow from his forehead. I was so anxious at the time that I thought, a good man eats in all directions, I don't want to suffer this boredom at home, I don't want the family property, and I went straight to Changchun. ... Alas! It's been ten years, who can be without a home? Sometimes I also want to go home and see, but when I think of the sad things in the past, I don't want to go back, and I don't even want to write a letter. To my surprise, last autumn I received a letter in Ulaanbaatar from my younger brother, which said: 'Brother, we are compatriots, don't be angry with me. The things of the past are not your fault, nor mine, it's all the fault of the old society. Our village established a senior agricultural cooperative last winter, and all the land belongs to the collective. The crops had a great harvest in the first year of the cooperative. Our family received more than 1,600 jin of grain. You now have two nephews. My wife, your brother's wife, and your nephews are always talking about you, hoping that you will come home for a reunion year...' To be honest, I didn't cry when my father died, but I shed tears after reading this letter. I was sad and ashamed at the time. I kept thinking in my heart: What did I go to Ulaanbaatar for? Wasn't it to help the Mongolian brothers build a happy life? The people of China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia can unite like brothers for a socialist goal, why do we, born of the same mother, have a grudge over a few acres of barren land! Later, I told the leadership about this situation, and the leadership gave me two months' leave to go home for the Spring Festival. Isn't it ridiculous? Thinking of the past is like having a nightmare."
    The train passed through one station after another, passing through one village after another, and the loud gongs and drums everywhere made people fascinated. Children threw lit firecrackers into the sky with force. The bright red Spring Festival couplets on the lintels of every household looked particularly clear in the white snow. That afternoon, the train arrived at Lancun. Lu Yuming packed his luggage and got off the train, and I also transferred here to the Lan (cun) Yan (tai) railway train to Laiyang. As soon as Lu Yuming stepped onto the platform, a middle-aged man with a crescent-shaped scar on his forehead led two boys to meet him, greeting him with a smile while taking his luggage. Then he pointed to the two boys beside him and said, "Aren't you two always talking about your uncle? This is your uncle, say hello quickly." So the two boys all looked up and shouted "Uncle". Lu Yuming's eyes suddenly became moist, and he quickly turned around and took out two "four happiness" hats from his package and put them on his nephews, and picked up the smaller one. The two little brothers happily looked at their uncle, then at their father. As for the sad things that had happened in their previous generation, they didn't know and would never understand.

    兄弟
    “回乡日记”之一
    吕建中
    旧历年尾，胶济铁路列车上的人很挤，许多旅客没有座位，一直站在车厢里。可是大家的心情都很好，都在琢磨着春节和亲人团聚之乐。每到一个车站，下车的旅客总是伸一伸腰，然后用舒展的语气说：“啊，到家啦！”不下车的旅客也喜欢跟上一句：“说不定您妈妈就在村头上等您呢！”
    坐在我对面的鲁毓明，每看到这种情况，只用羡慕的眼光笑一笑，然后望着窗口沉思。他给我的印象非常好。从济南一开车，我们就谈得很有味儿，不过那谈的光是他在蒙古人民共和国的情形。开始，因为他的打扮有些出众——草绿色棉袄、米黄色棉裤，上边都用机器缝了些花格格，头上戴一顶长舌头瓜皮帽，脚穿一双黑色高筒皮靴。从多皱纹的脸上看，他是饱经风霜的劳苦人，可是他那双深沉的眼睛，他身上那很讲究的金笔、铅笔和手表，又像是一个很有头脑的工程师。我先问他从什么地方来，他板着面孔一字一顿的回答：“从蒙古人民共和国首都乌—兰—巴—托—。”后来，他就逐渐把声调放自然了。他说他原是长春市的泥瓦工人，1952年上级号召去援助蒙古人民共和国建设，他报了名，和长春市三千多个建筑工人一起到了乌兰巴托。他和苏联工程师们，和蒙古的工人兄弟们一样，成天价风里来雨里去。一幢幢楼房，一条条马路修建好了，他又转到乌兰巴托附近农村帮助居民打井、盖房子。过去当地居民住的是蒙古包，吃水要用车子到百里以外去拉。苏联专家便帮助他们研究用铁管子打井，把几十丈深的地下水引上来，解决了当地居民的吃水问题。鲁毓明开始不习惯那种生活，像气候变幻无常，老是用大锅煮牛羊肉吃，等等，不过慢慢也就习惯了。他觉得蒙古人民强悍、诚实，很可爱，能到那里帮助蒙古兄弟建设社会主义，是自己一生当中最光荣的事。
    不过从情绪上看，他怀念家乡的心情并不比别人淡漠。他说他今年五十岁了还不曾结过婚，那他在怀念着谁呢？我深知我的故乡的人民，解放前凡是背井离乡到东北谋生的，大都有自己的不幸的遭遇。于是我在鲁毓明望着窗口沉思的时候，又问他：“您几年没回家了？”
   “唔！快有十四年了。”
   “家里有什么人？”
   “有兄弟、侄子。”
   “那他们兴许会到车站接您，分别十来年了。”
   “那，不会吧。下雪，路不好走，我家隔蓝村车站还有七、八里地呢。”
   “您怎么十来年才回家来看一次呢？”
    这回，鲁毓明没有立刻回答我，他低下头，轻轻笑了笑。然后望着我的脸，若有所思地说：“同志，咱是乡亲，我给您说说吧，我这次回家，心里又难过，又高兴。我是个穷人，我父亲死时只给俺弟兄俩留下三间房，五亩地，还有一支卖豆腐的破秤。父亲死了不到三年，我兄弟媳妇就要我弟弟和我分家。那时候我性子暴，心想，这是用不上我啦，要我自己出去刷锅抹碗。俗话说，姜是老的好，儿子是小的好。我弟弟二十岁，父亲就拉饥荒给他成个家，可是那时候我三十多岁还是光棍一条。我心里想的窄，光觉着冤屈的慌，对分家也就没好气。弟兄俩为争那几亩薄地吵了好几天，后来竟动手打起来。我一气，捞起我父亲留下那块铁秤锤朝他脸上就打，打得他前额上鲜血直流。我当时一急，心想，好汉吃四方，不在家生这份闷气，家产我不要了，一腿就拉到长春。……唉！十来年了，谁能没个家，我有时也想回家看看，可是一想起过去那伤心事就不愿回去了，连信也不想写。真出我意料，去年秋天在乌兰巴托接到一封信，是我弟弟寄来的，信上说：“哥，咱是同胞，您不要生我的气了。过去的事情不怨您，也不怨我，都怨旧社会不好。咱村去年冬天成立了高级农业社，土地都归集体所有了，建社头一年庄稼就大丰收。咱家分了一千六百多斤粮食。您现在已经有两个侄儿了。我和您兄弟媳妇、您侄儿成天价念叨您，盼着您回家过个团圆年……”说实话，俺爹死时我没哭，看过这封信我流了眼泪。我当时又难过，又惭愧，我心里一直想：我到乌兰巴托是为了什么？不是为了帮助蒙古兄弟建立幸福生活吗？中苏蒙三国人民为了一个社会主义目标能团结得像亲兄弟一样，为什么我们一母同胞却为了几亩薄地结下怨仇！后来我把这情况向领导上一说，领导上给我两个月的假回家过春节。您说可笑不？想起过去的事真像做了一场恶梦。”
    列车穿过一个车站又一个车站，掠过一个村庄又一个村庄，到处响亮的锣鼓声使人入迷。孩子们把点燃着的爆竹用力掷向天空。家家门楣上那通红的春联，在皑皑的白雪中显得格外鲜明。这天过午，列车到了蓝村，鲁毓明收拾行李下车，我也从这里转乘蓝（村）烟（台）铁路列车到莱阳。鲁毓明刚踏上站台，一个额角上有块月牙痕的中年人就领着两个男孩向他迎面赶过来，一边接行李，一边笑嘻嘻的问好。接着又指点身旁两个男孩说：“您俩不是成天念伯伯吗？这就是伯伯，快问好。”于是两个男孩一齐仰着脸儿喊“伯伯”，鲁毓明顿时眼睛润湿了，他连忙转身从包裹里拿出两顶四喜帽给侄儿戴上，又把小的一个抱起来。两个小弟兄高兴得看看伯伯，再看看爸爸。至于在他们前一辈身上曾经发生过的那种伤心事，他们不知道，也永远不能理解。
