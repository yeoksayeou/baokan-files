Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 28th: The United Nations Special Political Committee concluded its discussion on February 27th on the issue of US interference in the internal affairs of socialist countries and subversive activities against these countries, according to TASS, New York.

    Polish representative Michalowski emphasized that the issue being discussed by the committee was an important one. Without adherence to the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs and sovereignty of other countries, it would be difficult to imagine any international cooperation.

    Michalowski then spoke about various hostile activities by the United States against Poland, such as sending spies into Poland and distributing leaflets by balloon, calling on the Polish people to strike and demonstrate. He emphasized that the US hostile propaganda against Poland and other socialist countries was, in effect, using the long-discredited "Cold War" methods in relations between countries.

    Representatives of many countries spoke in defense of the US policy of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. New Zealand, the Philippines, France, and Italy were particularly zealous.

    Next, Soviet representative Kuzentsov spoke. He said that the Soviet delegation had raised this issue with the United Nations because the subversive activities of the United States against socialist countries had recently become increasingly dangerous, posing a threat of new provocations. The purpose was to timely remind everyone of the danger to peace posed by US aggressive actions, so that urgent measures could be taken to stop US interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

    Kuzentsov pointed out that activities hostile to the people of socialist countries were being widely carried out in the United States. The US government was also doing everything possible to obstruct actions aimed at normalizing relations with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries and developing cooperation.

    Kuzentsov refuted the slanderous remarks made by the representatives of Britain, France, Italy, and many other countries against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. He said that the many facts cited in the discussion of the Political Committee proved that the US imperialist bloc was grossly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and carrying out subversive activities against systems and governments it did not like.

    The Soviet delegation believed that the discussion of this issue by the Special Political Committee would not only help to clarify one of the most important and dangerous sources of increased international tension but would also reconfirm the urgent need to take measures to stop US subversive activities against other countries, as it violated the United Nations Charter and was detrimental to peace.

    The Soviet delegation was convinced that the adoption of its proposal on this issue would be an important contribution to easing international tension and establishing an atmosphere of trust and international cooperation.

    Syrian representative Tarazi said that it was truly astonishing that representatives of countries like Britain and France dared to talk about "human rights" and "justice" in the current debate, as the whole world knew that they had been carrying out subversive activities against the governments of many countries and had been suppressing and oppressing the people of Asia and Africa for many years.

    Yugoslav representative Ninčić said that it was necessary to adhere to the principle of non-interference in internal affairs and respect the sovereignty of other countries. At the same time, he said that the Yugoslav delegation did not like the "manner" in which the issue was raised and therefore decided not to participate in the debate on the issue and decided to abstain when voting on the Soviet proposal.

    Subsequently, the Soviet proposal was put to a vote. The proposal was defeated by a majority vote.

    Eight votes were in favor of the Soviet proposal: the Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, the Byelorussian Republic, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and the Ukrainian Republic. Eleven abstained: Egypt, India, Indonesia, Finland, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Yemen, Burma, Ceylon, and Yugoslavia. Fifty-three voted against the Soviet proposal.

    After the vote, Soviet representative Kuzentsov spoke again. He said that although the Soviet proposal had been rejected by the majority of the committee, no one doubted the fact that the United States was interfering in the internal affairs of the people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union. The United Nations could not, and should not, allow one of its member states to carry out consistent subversive activities against other member states of the organization, as this threatened peace and security and worsened relations between countries. Kuzentsov concluded by saying that the Soviet Union would continue to work to eliminate the roots that hinder countries from strengthening mutual trust and would strive to develop peaceful cooperation between all countries with different social systems.

    苏波等国代表在联合国特别政委会上发言
    为了和平必须使美国停止颠复活动
    苏联所提谴责美国干涉他国内政的提案被委员会多数否决
    据新华社28日讯  据塔斯社纽约28日讯：联合国特别政治委员会27日结束了关于美国干涉社会主义国家的内政和对这些国家进行颠复活动的问题的讨论。
    波兰代表米哈洛夫斯基强调指出，委员会所讨论的问题是一个重要的问题。不遵守不干涉他国内政和主权的原则，就很难想像什么国际合作了。
    米哈洛夫斯基接着谈到美国派遣间谍潜入波兰以及用气球散发传单，号召波兰人民罢工和示威等种种敌视波兰的活动。他强调指出，美国对波兰和其他社会主义国家进行敌意宣传，实际就是在国与国的关系中运用早已声名狼籍的“冷战”方法。
    许多国家的代表发言维护美国干涉他国内政的政策。新西兰、菲律宾、法国和意大利特别卖力。
    接着，苏联代表库兹?佐夫发言。他说，由于美国对社会主义国家的颠复活动最近以来具有越来越大的危险性，具有引起新的挑衅的威胁，苏联代表团才向联合国提出了这个问题，目的是及时提醒大家注意美国侵略行动对和平的危险，以便采取紧急措施制止美国对它国内政的干涉。
    库兹?佐夫指出，在美国国内广泛展开了敌视社会主义国家人民的活动。美国官方也百般地阻挠要求同苏联和人民民主国家关系正常化和发展合作的行动。
    库兹?佐夫驳斥了英国、法国、意大利和其他许多国家代表对苏联和人民民主国家的污蔑言论，他说，政治委员会讨论中引证的许多事实证明了美国帝国主义集团粗暴地干涉别国内政，并且对它所不喜欢的制度和政府进行颠复活动。
    苏联代表团认为，特别政治委员会对这个问题的讨论不仅有助于弄清国际紧张局势加剧的最重要的危险根源之一，而且又一次证实了迫切需要采取措施来制止美国对别国的颠复活动，因为它违反联合国宪章，不利于和平。
    苏联代表团深信，通过它所提的关于这个问题的提案将是对缓和国际紧张局势以及建立信任和国际合作气氛的重要贡献。
    叙利亚代表塔拉西说，像英国和法国这类国家的代表在目前的辩论中竟然也敢说“人权”和“正义”，委实令人惊异，因为全世界都知道，它们对许多国家的政府进行颠复活动，多年来一直镇压和压迫亚非各国人民。
    南斯拉夫代表宁契奇说，必须要遵守不干涉内政的原则和尊重其他国家的主权。同时，他又说，南斯拉夫代表团不喜欢提出这个问题的“方式”，因而决定不参加对这个问题的辩论，并且决定在表决苏联提案的时候弃权。
    随后，苏联的提案提付表决。这个提案以多数票被否决了。
    赞成苏联提案的有八票：苏联、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、白俄罗斯共和国、波兰、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克和乌克兰共和国。十一票弃权：埃及、印度、印度尼西亚、芬兰、阿富汗、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚、也门、缅甸、锡兰和南斯拉夫。反对苏联提案的有五十三票。
    表决以后，苏联代表库兹?佐夫再一次发言。他说，苏联的提案虽然被委员会的多数所否决，但是没有人怀疑美国干涉人民民主国家和苏联的内政这个事实。联合国不能、也不应该听任它的一个成员国对这个组织的其他成员国进行一贯的颠复活动，因为这样做威胁着和平与安全，恶化了国家之间的关系。库兹?佐夫最后说，苏联将来仍然要继续努力，消除妨碍各国加强相互信任的根源，致力于发展社会制度不同的一切国家之间的和平合作。
