Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 17th. According to broadcasts from Medan Radio and reports from Antara News Agency, Indonesian President Sukarno stated at a mass rally in Medan on the afternoon of March 16th, attended by over ten thousand people, that the final consideration regarding his proposal had actually been announced on the evening of the 15th. This consideration involved designating Suwirjo, the Chairman of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, to organize a cabinet capable of taking clear and correct steps. This cabinet must establish a National Council conforming to his proposal.

Sukarno stated that he wanted to organize such a cabinet because his suggested "cooperation cabinet" had met with both approval and disapproval. He said that he was not yet satisfied with the results of his consideration, and he still "yearned" for a "cooperation cabinet." His entire proposal remains his ideal.

Sukarno revealed that certain factions disagreeing with aspects of the President's proposal advocated for the establishment of a presidential cabinet, but one composed of only certain groups, excluding another group from participation. The President stated that these groups do not reflect the desire for national peace, and therefore he rejected these suggestions.

Sukarno said, "I do not understand these people; they want me to ride a horse, but then say they must first cut off one of the horse's legs. I cannot and will not ride a three-legged horse."

In his speech, Sukarno also mentioned that the Indonesian nation must maintain discipline and not become fragmented. He urged everyone to be vigilant against imperialist plots to carry out subversive activities in Indonesia.

President Sukarno was warmly welcomed by the people of Medan. People lined the streets to welcome him and shouted slogans in support of the Sukarno proposal.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 17th. According to Antara News Agency, Suwirjo, the Chairman of the Indonesian Nationalist Party who has been entrusted with forming a cabinet, said last night that members of parties who reject the President's proposal, such as those who disagree with the establishment of a National Council, would be difficult to invite to join the new cabinet.

Suwirjo said: "If we study the President's instructions for organizing the National Council, it is understandable that the cabinet formation work must conform to the President's proposal."

When President Sukarno entrusted Suwirjo with forming a cabinet on the 15th, he instructed Suwirjo to organize a cabinet capable of taking firm and correct steps and capable of establishing a National Council in accordance with his proposal.

    苏加诺宣布新内阁须成立民族委员会
    号召维护国家纲纪警惕帝国主义颠复阴谋
    新华社雅加达17日电　据棉兰电台的广播和安塔拉通讯社的消息，印度尼西亚总统苏加诺3月16日下午在棉兰一个有十几万人参加的群众大会上说，关于对他的方案的最后考虑结果实际上已经在15日晚间宣布，那就是指定印度尼西亚国民党总主席苏维约组织一个能够采取明确和正确步骤的内阁，这个内阁要成立符合他的方案的民族委员会。
    苏加诺说，他要组织这样一个内阁是因为他所建议的“合作内阁”遇到了赞同和不赞同的两方面意见。他说，他对自己这种考虑的结果还不感到满意，他还“向往”“合作内阁”。他的全部方案仍然是他的理想。
    苏加诺透露，不同意总统方案的某些方面主张成立总统制内阁，但是又只要由某些集团组成，而不要另外的一个集团参加。总统说，这些集团并不能反映民族和平的愿望，因此，他拒绝了这些建议。
    苏加诺说，我不了解这些人，他们要我骑马，但是又说他们必须先砍掉一只马脚。我不能够，也不愿意骑三脚马。
    苏加诺在演说中还提到印度尼西亚国家必须维持纲纪，而不能变成四分五裂。他要求大家警惕帝国主义在印度尼西亚进行颠复活动的计划。
    苏加诺总统在棉兰受到人民群众的热烈欢迎。人们都夹道欢迎他，并且高呼拥护苏加诺方案的口号。
    据新华社雅加达17日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，受命组阁的印度尼西亚国民党总主席苏维约昨天晚上说：拒绝总统方案的党派，例如不同意成立民族委员会的那些党派的成员很难被邀请参加新内阁。
    苏维约说：如果我们研究一下总统提出的组织民族委员会的指示，组阁工作必须符合总统的方案，这是可以理解的。
    苏加诺总统在15日授命苏维约组阁的时候，曾经指示苏维约要组织一个能够采取坚决和正确的步骤，并且能够按照他的方案，成立民族委员会的内阁。
