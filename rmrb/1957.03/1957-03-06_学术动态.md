	The New Edition of "Collected Works of Lenin"
	On January 21st of this year, the Soviet newspaper Pravda published an article by R. Obichkin, Director of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism under the Central Committee of the CPSU, entitled "The Great Creations of Lenin's Genius," introducing some information about the new edition of the "Collected Works of Lenin" that is about to be published.
	According to the decision of the Central Committee of the CPSU, the Institute of Marxism-Leninism is preparing to publish a new edition of the "Collected Works of Lenin" in fifty-five volumes. The first few volumes of this edition will be published before the end of 1957. The entire collection will be completed in 1963.
	The "Collected Works of Lenin" has been published in four editions in the past. The first edition was published from 1920 to 1926. The second and third editions were published from 1925 to 1932. The fourth edition was published from 1941, 1946 to 1950. The content of these editions became richer each time, but they all had many shortcomings.
	The new edition will include more of Lenin's works. More than eighty of Lenin's works have been published in newspapers and magazines since the publication of the fourth edition of the "Collected Works." Some of these are extremely important documents, such as "Letter to the Congress" and "On the Question of Nationalities or ‘Autonomization’." A large number of previously unknown works by Lenin were discovered in Krakow, Poland, two years ago. There are also many works that were printed in magazines, newspapers, and "Lenin Miscellany" at the time, but have not been included in the complete works until now. All of these works will be included in the new edition of the Complete Works.
	The new edition of the "Collected Works of Lenin" will include all the documents published in the third and fourth editions, including completed works and preparatory materials: plans, outlines, letters, notes, etc.
	The preparatory materials included in the new edition mainly consist of documents from the "Lenin Miscellany." These include the first drafts of the books "The Development of Capitalism in Russia" and "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," preparatory works for the study of land issues and national issues, and other issues. The new edition will include the famous notes on "Marxism on the State" (the preparatory material for the book "State and Revolution"), and a summary written by Lenin on "Letters of Marx and Engels" published by Bebel and Bernstein in 1913. These materials open the treasure house of Lenin's creative thought, illustrating the kind of brilliant labor he undertook in preparing his works.
	The new edition of the Complete Works also includes many new documents from the period of foreign armed intervention and the domestic war. These include notes and drafts of orders, resolutions, decrees, and decisions on improving the work of state organs and on issues of economic construction.
	All documents in the new edition will be arranged in chronological order, with letters separated into several volumes. The book will have detailed reference materials: including a general preface, a short preface at the beginning of each volume, and at the end of each volume a detailed chronology, annotations, index of names, index of cited documents, etc.
	The new edition will be published by the State Political Books Publishing House, with a circulation of 200,000 copies. In order to meet the needs of those who have ordered the fourth edition of the Complete Works, the Institute of Marxism-Leninism will also publish a five-volume supplement to the fourth edition of the "Collected Works of Lenin," including some works published in the third edition but not included in the fourth edition. In addition, important works from the "Lenin Miscellany" will be published in three separate volumes. Volumes 36, 37, and 38 of the fourth edition of the Complete Works will be published this year.

	Recent Japanese Research on Mongolian History
	In recent years, the Japanese Mongolian history academic circles have become active again. At present, the research units are mainly the Institute of Oriental Culture at the University of Tokyo, the Institute for Research in Humanities at Kyoto University, the Institute of Religious Culture at Tenri University, the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, the Toyo Bunko, the Oriental Society, and the Eurasian Society. The scope of research includes history, geography, society, economy, language, race, and archeology. The main research results include: "Research on the Secret History of the Yuan Dynasty" by Kobayashi Takashiro, in which the author studied the "Secret History" from the perspectives of language, version, and translation. "The Social System of Mongolia in the Qing Dynasty" by Tayama Shigeru, in which the author analyzed the social nature of Mongolia in the Qing Dynasty, the role of banners and leagues, the Qing government's policy towards Mongolia, and the impact of Han Chinese land reclamation on the livelihoods of Mongolians. Kyoto's "Journal of Oriental Studies" Volume 24 "Special Issue on Yuan Dian Zhang Research" is a collection of research reports from the Yuan Dian Zhang Research Group of the Institute for Research in Humanities at Kyoto University, containing six papers. The Yuan Dian Zhang Research Group was established in 1950, led by Mongolian linguists Yamazaki Tadashi and Iwamura Shinobu, specializing in the punctuation and research of "Yuan Dian Zhang". The "Research Report of the Eurasian Society" published by the Eurasian Society was founded in 1952 and has now published three volumes. The content can be roughly divided into two parts: one part is papers on Mongolian history and language, and the other part is reports on their archeological excavations and social surveys in various parts of Inner Mongolia during the Anti-Japanese War. In addition, there is also the "Bibliography of Mongolian Studies" (1900-1950) compiled by the Institute for Research in Humanities at Kyoto University, and so on.
	In 1954, Iwamura Shinobu of Kyoto University and others also went to Afghanistan to investigate the remnants of the Mongols and discovered a 13th-century Mongolian inscription near Besal. He is now working on translating Rashid al-Din's "Jami al-Tawarikh."
	Japanese research on Mongolian history began in the early 20th century. In the past, the research direction was mostly focused on China and Mongolia; in recent years, there has been a trend towards the Middle East. (Ran)

    “列宁全集”的新版本
    今年1月21日的苏联真理报上，发表了苏共中央马克思列宁主义学院院长r·奥比契金的一篇文章——“列宁天才的伟大创作”，介绍将要出版的“列宁全集”新版本的一些情况。
    根据苏共中央的决定，马克思列宁主义学院正准备出版五十五卷本的“列宁全集”的新版本。这一版的最初几卷将在1957年年底以前出版。全集将在1963年全部出齐。
    “列宁全集”过去曾经出版过四版。第一版是在1920至1926年出版的。第二、第三版是在1925至1932年出版。第四版是在1941、1946至1950年出版的。这些版本的内容一次比一次丰富，但都有不少缺点。
    新版本中，将列入列宁的更多的著作。在“全集”第四版出版以后，在报章杂志上发表了八十篇以上的列宁的作品。其中有一些是极为重要的文献，如“给代表大会的信”，“关于民族问题或‘自治化’问题”等。两年前在波兰的克拉科夫，发现了大批从前不知道的列宁的作品。还有许多著作，当时印在杂志、报纸上和“列宁文辑”里的，直到现在没有列入全集之中。以上这些作品，都将收入新版的全集中。
    新版的“列宁全集”，将收入第三版和第四版中发表过的全部文献，其中包括已完成的作品和准备材料：计划、大纲、书信、笔记等。
    新版中列入的准备材料，主要有“列宁文辑”中的文献。其中有“俄国资本主义的发展”、“帝国主义是资本主义发展的最高阶段”两书的初稿、研究土地问题和民族问题以及其他问题的准备作品。新版将包括有名的“马克思主义论国家”的笔记，（内容是“国家与革命”一书的准备材料）列宁就1913年由倍倍尔和伯恩斯坦出版的“马克思与恩格斯书信”写的一个摘要。这些材料，打开了列宁创造性思想的宝库，说明了他在准备自己的著作的时候，进行了一些什么样的天才的劳动。
    新版的全集还包括许多外国武装干涉和国内战争期间的新的文献。包括一些关于改善国家机构工作，关于经济建设问题的笔记和命令、决议、法令、决定的草稿。
    新版中的一切文献都将按照时间先后排列，书信另外分成数卷。全书将有详细的参考材料：包括一篇总的前言，每一卷前面一篇简短的前言，每卷末附有的大事年表、注释、人名索引、引用文献索引等。
    新版本将由国家政治书籍出版局出版，发行二十万部。为了满足已订购全集第四版的人的需要，马克思列宁主义学院并将出版五卷“列宁全集”第四版的补遗，其中包括第三版刊出而第四版未列入的一些著作。此外将把“列宁文辑”内的重要的著作出版单行本三册。第四版全集的三十六、三十七、三十八卷，将在今年出版。（陈用仪）
    近年日本对蒙古史的研究
    最近几年来，日本蒙古史学界又开始活跃起来。目前，研究的单位主要是东京大学东洋文化研究，所、京都大学人文科学研究所、天理大学宗教文化研究所、东京外国语大学、东洋文库、东方学会和欧亚学会等。研究的范围包括历史、地理、社会、经济、语言、人种和考古等方面。研究的成果主要有：小林高四郎著的“元朝秘史的研究”，著者从语言、版本、译文等方面，对“秘史”作了研究。田山茂著的“清代蒙古的社会制度”，书中分析了清代蒙古的社会性质，旗、盟的作用，清廷的对蒙政策，以及汉人垦田对蒙古人生计的影响。京都“东方学报”第二十四册“元典章研究专号”，这是京都大学人文科学研究所元典章研究班的研究报告集，共收论文六篇。元典章研究班是1950年成立的，由蒙古语学家山崎忠和岩村忍等人领导，专门从事“元典章”的点读和研究。欧亚学会出版的“欧亚学会研究报告”，创刊于1952年，现已出版三册。内容大略可以分为两个部分，一部分是有关蒙古的历史、语言的论文，一部分是我国抗战时期他们在内蒙古各地的考古发掘和社会调查的报告。此外，还有京都大学人文科学研究所编的“蒙古研究文献目录”（1900—1950），等等。
    1954年，京都大学岩村忍等人还曾到过阿富汗斯坦，调查蒙古人的遗族，并在别沙尔附近发见了十三世纪的蒙文碑铭。现在，他正着手翻译拉施特丁的“史集”。
    日本对蒙古史的研究，始于二十世纪初年。过去，研究方向多放在中国和蒙古方面；最近几年，颇有转向中东方面的趋势。（然）
