An Example of Overcoming Difficulties by Relying on the Masses

　　Zhu Gengsheng uses the example of Jiaxing Navigation District solving the difficulty of many passengers and few ships during the Spring Festival by tapping potential on the basis of existing tools, to illustrate that as long as we rely on the masses and criticize dogmatism, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome.
    Please allow me to speak for the second time at this conference, because I think it is necessary to raise the following two points at the conference.
    I. How the Jiaxing Navigation District relied on the masses to criticize dogmatism, and tapped potential on the basis of existing tools to solve the difficulty of many passengers and few ships during the Spring Festival.
    With the development of industry and agriculture and the improvement of people's lives, passenger transport in the Jiaxing Navigation District increased by 20% in 1956 compared to 1955, and during the Spring Festival of 1957 it increased by 30% compared to the normal period of 1956. However, the number of motorized passenger ships has always remained at the original number in 1955 without any increase. Therefore, in the normal period of 1956, there was a serious phenomenon of passengers making trouble and even demolishing the docks because there were no ships to take. Obviously, if there were no motorized ships to provide support during the Spring Festival passenger transport period in 1957, many passengers would not be able to return home, causing even more serious problems. However, the shipping company really could not provide support from above, because there was tension everywhere. At that time, some shipping workers, including myself, had serious feelings of fear of difficulty, and felt that we really did not know how to overcome this serious difficulty. The Party and the government attached great importance to this issue, and mobilized the shipping management and crew comrades to brainstorm ideas together. Some comrades suggested that motorized sailing ships could tow another wooden boat, which would increase transportation capacity, and some places had already successfully tested towing; however, some comrades opposed this, believing that motorized sailing ships were long and round-bottomed, making towing dangerous. Some comrades suggested reducing the passenger capacity of motorized ships to carry more passengers; however, some people opposed this, saying that the passenger capacity was a unified regulation of the Ministry of Communications of the Central Government, and we could not arbitrarily change it. If we wanted to change it, we had to report to the Ministry of Communications for approval before it could be implemented. Many other comrades refuted these dogmatic opinions, believing that the regulations of the higher authorities were only a principle. Passengers only want to have a boat to ride in the current situation of extremely tight transportation, and they don't necessarily care whether the seat is spacious or not. It is good to abide by the regulations of the higher authorities, but it cannot be too mechanical. As a result of the debate, the Party and the government criticized the erroneous ideas of conservatives and dogmatists, and strongly supported the creative opinions put forward by the majority of the masses, and tried the following methods:
    1. All motorized sailing ships with larger horsepower of fifteen horsepower should try towing wooden barges. In this way, a motorized sailing ship that usually carries only fifty passengers can increase the number of passengers by thirty to forty by towing another wooden boat. However, after a motorized sailing ship tows a wooden boat, it must drive slowly when passing bridges or turning, and be especially careful when sailing to avoid accidents.
    2. The passenger capacity was adjusted, and the originally stipulated zero point three two seat capacity was temporarily adjusted to zero point two eight. In this way, the more than ninety passenger ships in the Jiaxing Navigation District increased from the original five thousand seats by more than seven hundred seats after adjustment. The daily average of two voyages on short and long distances carried an additional one thousand four hundred passengers, and more than forty-two thousand passengers a month. Moreover, according to passenger feedback, the capacity of zero point two eight seats did not feel very narrow.
    After taking the above creative series of measures, combined with advance investigation of passenger sources, pre-sale of passenger tickets, and other methods, the serious practical difficulties of many passengers and few ships during this year's Spring Festival were successfully resolved in an orderly manner. At the same time, it also increased revenue for the enterprise and accumulated a sum of funds for socialist construction. This is also the specific implementation of Vice Premier Li's instructions to pay attention to the ability to utilize existing equipment or facilities in order to implement the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy.
    From this practical experience, I have further realized that our motherland has unlimited potential in all aspects and departments, in the existing equipment and existing strength. At the same time, there are still many difficulties in all work. However, as long as we can rely on the Party, rely on the masses, use our brains to tap potential, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. The problem is that we must first resolutely overcome conservative thinking, dogmatism, and bureaucracy.
    II. Expedite the renovation of the South Canal to benefit transportation and water conservancy in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.
    The South Canal was opened by Emperor Yang of Sui Dynasty. It runs through western Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu, crossing the Yangtze River and connecting with the North Canal. In the past and now, it is a vital water transport route connecting the north and the south, playing a huge role in the exchange of materials between the north and the south of our country. But as far as I know, the South Canal has become silted and shallow, with many hidden reefs (the huge stones of stone dams or collapsed bridges are sunk in the river), many bridges, and many bends due to years of disrepair, thus seriously affecting the safety of navigation and the turnover rate of ships (many obstacles, ships cannot drive fast). When the water is high, it is difficult for ships to enter the bridge holes, and when the water is low, ships are prone to touching grounded beaches. After liberation, the transportation department has dredged it sporadically several times, but due to various conditions, it is far from meeting the requirements. According to incomplete statistics, in the year 1956 alone, there were no less than a hundred major accidents such as touching damage, grounding, and collisions causing shipwrecks in the canal from Hangzhou to Suzhou, causing great losses to the country's property. At the same time, the South Canal has produced the above-mentioned obstacles due to years of disrepair. Every time the flood of the West Tiaoxi River and East Tiaoxi River of Tianmu Mountain rises sharply, the water flow cannot be quickly discharged into the river, causing the counties of Anji, Changxing, Yuhang, Wukang, and Deqing near the mountains to collapse and embankments to be breached, and the plains of Wuxing, Chongde, Tongxiang and the counties and cities in southern Jiangsu to become flooded with water and all the crops were submerged. The severe floods suffered by western Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu in the summer and autumn of 1954 and 1956, which have never been encountered in nearly a hundred years, have a great relationship with the years of disrepair of the South Canal. As we all know, the areas of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and Suzhou in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are the land of fish and rice in the motherland, and the granary of the motherland, and the essence of the motherland. The silk, hemp, and especially grain produced by it play an extremely important role in supporting the socialist industrialization of the motherland, as well as civilian food and military needs. If the South Canal is not renovated as soon as possible to prevent floods from continuing, the harm will not only be to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, but also to the great socialist construction of the entire motherland, which will inevitably be greatly affected. It should also be pointed out here that Zhejiang is the frontier of national defense in the motherland, and the South Canal is even more of an indestructible transportation line. For the consolidation of national defense, it is even more necessary to renovate the South Canal as soon as possible. Of course, the birth of New China is only seven years old, and limited by the current financial resources, it is impossible to prosper in one day. The major construction plan should first address the urgent and then the slow, and I think the renovation of the South Canal should belong to the urgent category.
    Based on the above, I especially suggest that the conference transfer the renovation of the South Canal to the central government as much as possible and include it in the second five-year plan, and that the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Water Resources jointly form a special committee for the renovation of the South Canal (with representatives of the Jiang and Zhejiang provincial people's committees participating), establish a construction organization to start construction as soon as possible (among them, regarding the route of the South Canal, I think it is still appropriate to use the old river course that passes through Jiaxing City, but it is necessary to avoid going through the city again and changing the route to the suburbs). This is what tens of millions of people in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces hope for, and the great socialist construction of the motherland is especially dependent on it.

　　依靠群众克服困难的一例
    祝更生　以嘉兴航区在现有工具的基础上，挖掘潜力解决了春节期间客多船少的困难为例，说明只要依靠群众、批判教条主义，没有克服不了的困难
    请允许我在这次大会上作第二次的发言，因为我认为以下两个意见在大会上提出，不是没有必要的。
    一、嘉兴航区是怎样的依靠群众批判了教条主义，在现有工具的基础上挖掘潜力解决了春节期间客多船少的困难。
    嘉兴航区旅客运输随着工农业的发展和人民生活的改善，在1956年比1955年就增加20％，到1957年的春节期间更比1956年的平时增加30％，而客运机动船却老是维持在1955年原有的数量上丝毫没有增加，因而在1956年的平时已出现旅客因无船可乘闹起来把码头都拆毁掉的严重现象。很显然，到了1957年春节客运的时期，如果没有机动船增援的话，那就有很多的旅客无法输送还乡，造成更严重的问题。可是，轮船在上级确实是无法支援，因为到处都是紧张。在当时有的航运工作同志连我自己也在内存在着严重的畏难情绪，感到真不知如何渡过这个严重的难关才好。党和政府十分重视到这一个问题，就发动航管和船员同志们来一齐动脑筋，有的同志就提出机帆船可以另拖一只木船，就增加了运输力量，而且有的地方已试拖成功；可是有些同志却反对，认为机帆船身长底圆，拖船危险。有的同志提出把机动船客位容积缩小一些，就可多载客人；可是又有人反对说，客位容积是中央交通部统一的规定，我们不能任意变更，要变更也得报交通部批准后才可执行。另有许多同志就反驳这些教条主义的意见，认为上级的规定只是一个原则。旅客在当前交通工具极度紧张的情况下所要求的是只要有船可乘就好，倒不一定再计较坐位是否宽适。遵守上级的规定是好的，但不能太机械。争辩的结果，党和政府批判了保守和教条主义者的错误思想，大力支持多数群众所提出的创造性的意见，即试行了以下的办法：
    1．凡十五匹马力较大的机帆船一律试拖木驳，这样以来，像平时只载客五十个的机帆船另拖一只木船，就增加客人三十到四十个。不过机帆船拖了木船后在过桥或转弯时要开得慢，要特别小心航行，避免发生事故。
    2．调整了客位容积，由原规定的零点三二坐位容积暂试行调整为零点二八。这样，在嘉兴航区九十多条客轮，由原有的五千多个客位，经过调整就增加了七百多个客位，长短途每天平均两个航次就多出运一千四百多人次，一个月就多出运四万二千多人次，而且据旅客反映零点二八客位的容积并不觉得十分窄挤。
    经过采取了以上创造性的一系列措施，并结合着预先调查客源、预售客票等办法，就很有秩序的顺利的解决了今年春节期间客多船少严重的实际困难。同时，也为企业增加了收入，为社会主义建设多积累了一笔资金。这也就是具体的执行了李副总理所指示，注意发挥原有设备或设施的能力，以贯彻增产节约的精神。
    从这一实际的经验中，使我更体会到我们祖国在各个方面各个部门里，在现有设备现有的力量中，都蕴藏着无限的潜力，同时在所有的工作中，也都尚存在着不少的困难。可是只要能依靠党依靠群众动脑筋挖潜力，是没有克服不了的困难的。问题还是在首先要坚决的克服保守思想、教条主义和官僚主义。
    二、尽速整治南运河，以利交通运输和江浙两省的水利。
    南运河开自隋炀帝，它贯穿了浙江的浙西和江苏的苏南越长江与北运河相接。过去是现在也是沟通南北水路交通，对我们祖国南北物资交流起着巨大的作用。可是就我所知，南运河因年久失修，已形成为淤浅多、暗礁多（两岸石坝或塌桥的巨石沉在河中）、桥梁多、弯道多，因而严重的影响到航行的安全和船舶的运转率
  （障碍多，轮船不能开快车）。水大时轮船进桥洞困难，水小时船易触搁浅滩。解放后交通部门曾经零星片段的疏浚过几次，但因受到各种条件的限制，是还远不能达到要求的。就不完全统计，只1956年一年自杭州到苏州一段运河中，就发生触损、搁浅、碰撞等沉船重大事故不下百余起，使祖国财物遭受莫大的损失。同时南运河因年久失修，产生了以上种种的障碍，每当天目山东西苕溪洪水暴涨，水流不能迅速下泄入江，造成近山的安吉、长兴、余杭、武康、德清等县埂倒堤决，吴兴、崇德、桐乡与苏南各县市平原地带遍成泽国田禾尽被湮没。1954年和1956年夏秋浙西苏南所遭受到近百年来从未遭受过的惨重水患，这是与南运河的年久失修有着很大的关系。众所周知，江浙两省的杭、嘉、湖、苏等地区为祖国鱼米之乡，为祖国的谷米仓，是祖国的精华所在，它所生产的丝、麻尤其是粮食，对支援祖国社会主义工业化，以及民食军需，都占着极其重要的位置，如不从早对南运河加以整治，使水患接连不断，则为害不仅是江浙两省，即整个祖国社会主义的大建设不可避免的亦将受到极大的影响。在这里还应当提出，浙江为祖国海防前哨，南运河更是炸不烂的运输线。为了国防的巩固，则南运河提早整治更有必要了。当然新中国的诞生才只有七年，限于目前的财力，不可能一日处兴，建设大计自应先其所急，后重所缓，而我认为南运河的整治是应属于先重急一类的。
    基上所述，我特建议大会转请中央把南运河的整治尽可能的列入第二个五年计划，并由交通、水利两部联合组成南运河整治专门委员会（吸收江浙两省人委代表参加），建立施工机构尽速施工（其中关于南运河线路，我认为还是就原有经过加兴市的老河道为宜，不过要避免再走过市区要改道郊外）。是为江浙两省数千万人民所殷望，祖国社会主义的大建设尤所厚赖。
