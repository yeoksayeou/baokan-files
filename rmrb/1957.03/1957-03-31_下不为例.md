    According to a Changjiang Daily report: "The 125 Team of the Central South Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau recently organized a work group to search for equipment, going deep into the countryside to find equipment that had been lost in the field in the past, and the results have been great."
    I have seen many work groups, but a "work group to search for equipment" is the first I've heard of. Is it a cause for joy or worry? For a moment, I couldn't discern what the feeling in my heart was.
    It seems like a cause for joy. The phrase "the results have been great" is indeed no exaggeration. According to statistics, they have found steel, pipes, steel wire rope, rubber tubing, etc., from the peasants, "amounting to more than ten cartloads, with a preliminary estimated value of four thousand yuan. Most of the equipment can be used immediately, some can be used after minor repairs, and some are currently scarce and relatively valuable in China."
    The nation's material resources are strained, and the demand for equipment exceeds supply, which is a common cry. The 125 Team has recovered such a large pile of treasures, which is indeed a cause for joy. However, equipment that can load more than ten cartloads, valued at four thousand yuan, and some of which is "scarce and relatively valuable in China," was actually lost. If there were no "work group to search for equipment," who knows how long it would have remained lost. It seems that it is not entirely a cause for joy. It is said that the Central South Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau has circulated the 125 Team's practice of organizing a work group to search for equipment throughout the bureau, encouraging others to emulate it, which shows that the loss of equipment is not limited to the 125 Team. This makes people feel a deep sense of the seriousness of the exploration team's loss of equipment, even while celebrating the "great results of the work group to search for equipment."
    However, on the other hand, the best thing, of course, is to cherish equipment and not lose it; since it has been lost, sending people to find it is indeed a thousand times better than letting it be lost. It is just that after finding it, do not be content with this, but also educate the staff more to prevent further losses, and by no means allow the work group to search for equipment to become a permanent institution.
    If we do not solve the problem at its root, if the work group is limited to searching for lost equipment, it is not difficult to predict that this institution will hardly be able to end its work. Because on one hand, they are searching, and on the other hand, things are being lost; on one hand, things are being lost, and on the other hand, they are searching. In this way, the cycle will be endless.
    Hearing about the "great results of the work group to search for equipment," I have a feeling, so I offer a "couplet," sent remotely to the 125 Team:
            The first line is: Work group searches for equipment, great results
            The second line is: Exploration team loses materials, considerable quantity
            The banner is: No More Examples

    长江日报消息：“中南煤田地质勘探局125队，最近组织了一个寻找器材工作组，深入到农村去寻找过去丢失在野外的器材，收获很大。”
    工作组，见过不少，但“寻找器材工作组”还是第一回听说。喜耶？忧耶？一时竟辨不出心头是什么滋味。
    看来，像是喜事。“收获很大”云云，确非言过其实。据统计，仅从农民那里寻找到的钢材、管子，钢丝绳、胶皮管等等，“共有十多乘马车，初步估计价值四千元。其中大部分器材马上就可使用，有一些经过稍为修理后也可使用，还有一些是目前国内缺少，较为贵重的器材。”
    国家物力艰难，器材供不应求是普遍呼声。125队找回来这么一大堆宝贝，确乎是喜事。然而，可以装十多乘马车，价值四千元的器材，有些还是“国内缺乏，较为贵重”的器材，竟然会丢失，若无“寻找器材工作组”，还不知要丢失到几时，似乎也并不尽是喜事。据说中南煤田地质勘探局已把125队组织寻找器材工作组的作法通报全局，仿效执行，可见丢失器材还不只125队一家。这就让人在喜庆“寻找器材工作组收获很大”之余，也不能不痛感勘探队丢失器材之严重了。
    不过，话又说回来，最好当然是珍惜器材，并无丢失；既然丢失了，派人去找回来，确实比让它丢失要好千百倍。只是找得之后，不要以此为足，还要多多教育职工不再丢失，万勿让寻找器材工作组变成常设机构。
    假如不从根本上来解决，假如工作组只限于寻找丢失器材，不难预料这个机构将很难结束它的工作。因为一面寻找，一面丢失，一面丢又一面寻找，这样，巡环往复，将无止境。
    听到“寻找器材工作组收获很大”有感，姑作“对联”一付，遥寄125队：
            上联是：工作组寻找器材收获很大
            下联是：勘探队丢失物资数量可观
            横批是：下不为例
