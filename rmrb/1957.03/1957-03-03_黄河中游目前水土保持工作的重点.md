The focus of soil and water conservation work in the middle reaches of the Yellow River should be on vigorously starting with farmland in conjunction with crop production. Only in this way can soil and water conservation work be universally launched and quickly achieve results. Farmland soil and water conservation is to carry out soil and water conservation with each farmland as a unit, so that the rainwater falling on the field is evenly distributed throughout the field surface and to prevent floods from flowing through the fields, so as to achieve the purpose of water not leaving the field. Farmland soil and water conservation can play a great role in reducing the total amount of soil and water loss in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, and is closely related to the current interests of farmers. Therefore, it should be taken as the focus of the current soil and water conservation work in this area.

The severity of soil erosion in the middle reaches of the Yellow River is directly related to two major constructions: one is to turn the Yellow River's water hazards into water conservancy, the most urgent of which is the construction of the Sanmenxia Reservoir; the other is to develop the production undertakings in this area and improve the lives of the people in this area. This is a major issue that needs to be resolved in the process of building socialism in our country. Therefore, soil and water conservation work has become an urgent and major task.

Because the scope of soil and water conservation work in the middle reaches of the Yellow River involves a variety of scientific and technological specialties, there are many professionals from all walks of life participating. Due to the different professional perspectives, some different views have arisen on how to start soil and water conservation work in this area. These views can be roughly divided into two schools: engineering route and biological route. The main content of the engineering route is to intercept the loss of soil and water by building large dams; the biological route uses vegetation, mainly forest cover, as its weapon. Which of these two routes is right and wrong can already be seen. According to Luo Laixing's "Opinions on Soil and Water Conservation Work on the Loess Plateau" published in the "People's Daily" on January 10, we know that the method of simply building large dams cannot solve the problem of soil erosion. As for the method of forest cover, the actual situation in nature proves that it is indeed an effective means to solve the large amount of soil erosion; however, because trees grow slowly, the speed of its effectiveness is relatively slow. If it is taken as the focus of soil and water conservation, it will inevitably give people the feeling of "distant water cannot quench near thirst." In addition, the above two routes also have a common shortcoming, that is, their relationship with the improvement of crop yields, which is the main source of income for farmers' economic life in this area, is not very close. In other words, it is not sufficiently combined with the current interests of farmers. Because of this relationship, it is not easy to fully motivate their enthusiasm for soil and water conservation, and it is not easy to make soil and water conservation work quickly and comprehensively unfold to meet the needs of national construction. Soil and water conservation work is a work with broad mass character. It needs to be done everywhere and by everyone in order to have an effect on a large area. The primary condition for achieving this is how to combine it with the vital interests of the broad masses; but while combining with the interests of the masses, we must not forget that the goal of the combination must achieve the maximum effect of soil and water conservation within a certain limit. Considering these two requirements, I believe that the focus of soil and water conservation work in the middle reaches of the Yellow River should be on vigorously starting with farmland in conjunction with crop production, because only in this way can soil and water conservation work be universally launched and quickly achieve results. Although all localities are carrying out farmland soil and water conservation to varying degrees, it is not taken as a prominent direction, so it is not done completely and systematically, and there is not enough attention paid to it in the minds of the general public, so it is worth raising this issue for research.

The middle reaches of the Yellow River is a semi-arid area (annual rainfall is about 400 mm). In addition, farmland soil erosion is serious, so crop yields are generally very low, generally about 60 to 70 jin per mu. Therefore, although each person generally owns more than 10 mu of farmland, the living standards of the people in this area are far behind other areas. Although the rainfall in this area is small, it is very concentrated (July, August, and September). If this limited rainwater can be kept in the farmland soil as much as possible by soil and water conservation methods, the output is expected to increase greatly. There is no lack of examples of soil and water conservation increasing production. For example, the demonstration results of ridge cultivation in Tianshui County, Gansu, showed that 40 corn demonstration fields yielded 18% more grain on average, and 11 sorghum demonstration fields yielded 10% more on average. As a result of soil and water conservation, the yield has increased significantly, and the enthusiasm of farmers for soil and water conservation will naturally rise. For example, in Anjiagou, Dingxi County, in 1955, only one activist, Niu Wanjin, tried to grow potatoes using the ridge cultivation method on 0.7 mu of land. The 0.7 mu produced 1,800 jin (0.7 mu can generally produce 600 jin). Everyone saw the benefits of soil and water conservation for increasing production. Therefore, in Anjiagou in 1956, not only were all potato fields cultivated using the ridge cultivation method, but all corn fields also used this method.

It seems that carrying out farmland soil and water conservation is only a matter of agricultural production, and the role it plays in soil and water conservation in the entire area is not significant. However, if we analyze it, we will know that this view is wrong. If farmland soil and water conservation is properly carried out so that water does not leave the field, the contribution to reducing the total amount of soil and water loss in an area and thus reducing the total amount of soil and water loss in the entire middle reaches will be very large.

According to the percentage of farmland in the total land area of the six key planned gullies in Jinxi and Longzhong by the Comprehensive Investigation Team for Soil and Water Conservation in the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, this problem can be explained. Among them, the percentage of reclamation in Wangjiagou, Lishi County, is 68.1, Caijiaya in Xing County is 56.96, Daohuangou in Hequ County is 63, Shaochagou in Huining County is 41.8, Anjiagou in Dingxi County is 68.95, and Xiaojingou in Lanzhou is 34.13. The average of the above figures is 53.82. In other words, on average, more than half of the area of each basin is occupied by farmland. If the soil and water of all farmland are conserved, the total amount of soil and water loss in a basin can be reduced by more than half, and soil and water loss in the entire middle reaches of the Yellow River can be prevented to a large extent. But in fact, farmland soil and water conservation contributes more than this to reducing the total amount of soil and water loss in an area. This point can be inferred from the characteristics of crop production itself.

One of the important conditions required for crop production is that the soil must be loosened frequently. Tilling before sowing, sowing, cultivating and weeding, and cultivating during the fallow period can all loosen the soil. As a result of soil loosening, in the case of small rainfall intensity, it is beneficial to the penetration of rainwater, reducing soil and water loss. But in this case, there is no soil and water loss phenomenon in this area, such as during the summer crop growth and autumn fallow periods; if the rainfall intensity is very large, the loose soil is most vulnerable to erosion due to the reduction of resistance to scouring. Soil and water loss from farmland in this area mostly occurs under this condition, such as during autumn crop growth and summer fallow periods, especially the loss of summer fallow land is more serious. Just from this point, we can see that the soil and water loss situation in farmland is far more serious than in non-farmland. During our investigation of soil and water conservation in Jinxi and Longzhong, we saw countless gullies appearing on the surface of farmland after every rainstorm. The number, depth, and width of the gullies were greater than those on the barren slopes of non-farmland. This is because barren slopes not only have wild grass, but also the soil is much denser than farmland, so although the loss of water is more, the soil is less eroded; while for farmland, the amount of water and soil loss is more. Based on this situation, if farmland accounts for 50% of the total area of an area, the total amount of soil and water loss from farmland is far more than this number.

The so-called farmland soil and water conservation is to carry out soil and water conservation with each farmland as a unit (because there are field ridges on sloping farmland, each field is separated into a definite unit), so that the rainwater falling on the field is evenly distributed throughout the field surface and to prevent floods from flowing through the fields, so as to achieve the purpose of water not leaving the field.

Since farmland belongs to the category of crop cultivation management, if the crop cultivation management can be combined with soil and water conservation benefits, it can also play a certain role in soil and water conservation, such as deep plowing, close planting, increasing soil structure, etc. However, judging from the distribution of farmland slope in this area (the slope of farmland in this area is generally around 20 degrees), these measures do not play a significant role in maintaining farmland soil and water. Of course, we do not object to paying attention to these measures, because various soil and water conservation measures generally have a cumulative effect, that is, the implementation of each measure will have a certain effect. Therefore, while implementing farmland soil and water conservation measures, adding these measures will also have certain benefits in reducing the total amount of soil and water loss from farmland. The farmland soil and water conservation measures referred to in this article refer to measures to intercept soil and water by using small-scale projects and two kinds of mechanical methods of soil and water conservation tillage. This measure can be divided into two categories, one is field surface measures, and the other is field surface boundary measures. Field surface measures are further divided into field surface gully measures and measures to increase the roughness of the field surface in combination with tillage.

The purpose of gully measures is to prevent the field surface from continuing to break and split, and at the same time slow down the speed of field surface runoff, so that other measures can easily intercept the effect of water flow. If there are gullies on the field surface, the water flow will converge in them and flow down, and the gullies will deepen day by day, and the same field will be split into two. The field block is constantly shrinking in this way. On the one hand, it reduces the effective area of the field block, and on the other hand, it is extremely inconvenient for cultivation. More importantly, in terms of current benefits, if the water flow in the gullies is allowed to converge and flow down, it will affect the role of the roughness and boundary measures in intercepting water flow. The most effective gully measure is the water scoop built by some farmers in Jinxi, and the lying ox pit is also a good method.

The so-called increasing the roughness of the field surface is to combine the use of animal-powered agricultural tools and combine the possibility of crop cultivation to make the field surface uneven with pits and ridges everywhere, so as to intercept water flow in situ everywhere. This measure is most closely combined with crop production. Because if the rainwater is evenly distributed to all parts of the farmland, the crops in the same field can grow evenly and neatly, so that the crops will not grow too vigorously or even be submerged in places where the water flow is concentrated and lost, while most of the crops on the field surface will grow weakly or die. The measures to increase the roughness of the field surface that are currently effective include ridge cultivation, horizontal plow furrows, corn ring soil accumulation, corn gully and ridge alternation, wheat horizontal anti-erosion gullies, broad furrows for fallow land plowing, three-string soil cultivation for millet, ridge cultivation for potatoes, and string ridge soil cultivation for millet, etc. Among these methods, horizontal plow furrows are more widely adapted, and can be applied regardless of slope or crop type.

Field surface boundary measures refer to the measures taken at the downward boundary of a field slope. The purpose of this measure is to prevent the water and soil in this field from being finally intercepted when the runoff or speed of the field surface is too large, exceeding the capacity that gully and roughness measures can intercept, and to prevent the phenomenon of flow between fields. Therefore, boundary measures are the last line of defense for farmland soil and water conservation measures. The most effective boundary measure is the field edge ridge. In addition, soft ridges and the "gold basin raising fish" method are also used in some places. In 1956, during our inspection in Gansu, we were stranded in Jieshipu Town, Jingning County, for several days due to continuous heavy rain. According to farmers, if there had been mountain floods in the past, the soil erosion would have been effectively prevented because field edge ridges were built on the mountains, down the mountains, and in every field in this area. Based on our personal experience in Jieshipu and the actual situation we saw in other places, I believe that field edge ridges are indeed very effective in preventing the outflow of water and soil from fields.

In addition, the field edge ridge is of great help to the construction of terraces, which is also worth noting.

For the benefit of soil and water conservation and the convenience of cultivation, the most ideal thing is of course to turn sloping farmland into flat terraces. However, if the terraces are built by leveling them all at once, considering the excessive labor and other reasons, this can be said to be a luxury for the farmland in the entire middle reaches. Therefore, terraces can be made to gradually become flat by building field edge ridges, so the problem is not big. Because when cultivating on sloping land, it is necessary to turn the soil to the side where the slope drops. The thickness of the soil turned every year is 10 to 20 cm. On the other hand, a part of the water and soil is lost downward, so the area near the field edge ridge is gradually silted up. In this way, the field surface can gradually become flat by gradually raising the field edge ridge with the thickness of the siltation. Using this method to build terraces saves labor and has no other risks. Building field edge ridges is a labor-saving task, and the technology is relatively simple, so women, children, and the elderly can operate it. In addition, building field edge ridges must be done after the rain (because the soil is wet and easy to pat firmly at this time), and other work cannot be done on the ground immediately after the rain, so young and middle-aged people patting the field edge ridges will not cause a waste of labor. Many agricultural cooperatives in Gansu go up the mountains to pat the ridges after every rain, forming a soil and water conservation upsurge. For example, in many agricultural cooperatives in Longde County, the task of patting the field edge ridges is entirely undertaken by female members, and the quality of their work has reached a very high standard.

When carrying out farmland soil and water conservation measures, all three aspects of the measures mentioned above (if there are no gullies on the field surface, the gully measures can be omitted) must be implemented in coordination, so as to achieve the effect of increasing crop production and preventing water from leaving the field. Many places only pay attention to building field edge ridges for farmland soil and water conservation. This is flawed. On the one hand, because it is not closely related to crop production, and on the other hand, because no measures are taken in the upper part, the runoff and speed are too large, so that the safety of the field edge ridge is not guaranteed, and holes are easily penetrated.

If the farmland soil and water conservation measures cannot be fully implemented at once, then like other soil and water conservation measures, the principle of "from top to bottom" should be followed, starting from the farmland at the top of the ridge and gradually reaching the bottom of the gully.

Based on the above, farmland soil and water conservation should be taken as the focus of the current soil and water conservation work in this area because it can play a great role in reducing the total amount of soil and water loss in the middle reaches of the Yellow River and is closely related to the current interests of farmers. If the conditions in all aspects are limited and measures other than farmland cannot be carried out quickly, then we should start with farmland in an all-round way. Of course, farmland soil and water conservation cannot exclude or replace the implementation of other soil and water conservation measures, because many barren slopes still need to be treated. In addition, a part of the overly steep farmland still needs to be gradually returned to forest or grassland after the unit area yield is increased; if it is necessary to develop the diversified operation of the mountain economy, it is also necessary to develop other production undertakings such as forestry and animal husbandry accordingly under the principle of soil and water conservation.

Although soil and water conservation work in the middle reaches of the Yellow River is a difficult construction undertaking because the area to be treated is very large, we can quickly achieve results as long as we can fully mobilize the broad masses and start from the key areas.

    黄河中游目前水土保持工作的重点
    西北农业生物研究所副研究员  雷清溶
    黄河中游的水土保持工作首先应该结合农作物生产大力从农田上做起，这样才能使水土保持工作普遍展开并很快取得成效。农田水土保持就是以每一农田为单位进行水土保持，使降落到本田的雨水尽量均匀分布在整个田面并防止各田洪水串流，以达到水不出田的目的。农田水土保持能对黄河中游地区水土总流失量的减少起到很大的作用，又同农民当前的利益密切结合，因此应作为这一地区目前开展水土保持工作的重点。
    黄河中游水土流失的严重性直接关系到两项重大的建设：一项是变黄河水害为水利，其中最迫切的是三门峡水库的兴建；一项是发展这一地区的生产事业，改善这一地区人民的生活。这是我国在建设社会主义过程中需要解决的重大问题，因此水土保持工作也就成为刻不容缓的、重大的任务。
    黄河中游水土保持工作的范围因为涉及多种科学技术专业，所以参加的各行专业人员很多。由于专业角度的不同，于是对这一地区水土保持工作究竟应该如何着手的问题就产生了一些不同的看法。这些看法大约可以分为工程路线和生物路线两派。工程路线的主要内容是用打大坝的办法截拦水土的流失；生物路线所持的武器则是建立植被，其中主要的是森林的被复。这两种路线孰是孰非，目前已经可以看出一点端倪。根据1月10日“人民日报”所载罗来兴同志“对黄土高原水土保持工作的意见”一文来看，我们知道单凭打大坝的办法是解决不了水土流失问题的。至于森林被复的办法，由自然界现实的情况证明，确是解决水土大量流失的有效手段；但由于树木的生长较慢，在发生效果的速度上比较迟缓，如果把它作为水土保持的重点不免令人有“远水解不了近渴”的感觉。此外，以上两种路线还具备了一个共同的不足之点，那就是它们对目前这一地区农民经济生活主要收入来源的农作物产量的提高关系是不十分密切的，换句话说，就是同农民当前的利益结合不够。由于这样的关系，就不容易充分激励他们对保持水土的积极性，也就不容易使水土保持工作迅速全面地展开，以赶上国家建设的需要。水土保持工作是带有广泛群众性的一项工作，需要处处动手、人人动手，才可以在广大的面积上发生效果，要做到这一点，首要的条件就是如何使它同广大群众的切身利益相结合；但在同群众利益结合的同时，我们也并不能忘记所结合的目标要能在一定限度内取得最大的保持水土的效果。根据这两点要求来考虑，笔者认为黄河中游的水土保持工作首先应该结合农作物生产大力从农田上做起，因为只有这样才能使水土保持工作普遍展开并很快取得成效。关于农田水土保持各地方虽多少都在进行，但不是作为一个突出的方向，所以作的不够完整和系统，并且在一般人的思想上也没有足够的重视，因此值得把这一问题提出来研究。
    黄河中游是一个半干旱的地区（年雨量在四百毫米左右），加之农田水土流失严重，因此作物产量普遍很低，每亩一般六十到七十斤左右，因此虽然每人一般占有农田十亩以上，但这一地区人民的生活水平却远远落后于其他地区。这一地区雨量虽少，但很集中 （7、8、9三月），若能把这一有限雨水用水土保持方法尽量保持在农田土壤中，产量就可望大大增加。关于水土保持能增产的事例是颇不缺乏的。如垅作区田在甘肃天水县示范结果，四十块玉米示范田，平均多打粮食18％，十一块高粱示范田，平均多打粮食10％。由于水土保持的结果，产量显著提高，农民对水土保持的积极性就自然会高涨起来，如定西县安家沟1955年仅有积极分子牛万金一人用七分地试行垅作法种洋芋，七分地产了一千八百斤（七分地一般能产六百斤），大家看到水土保持对增产的好处，于是安家沟1956年不但洋芋田全部进行垅作，而且全部玉米田也都用了这个方法。
    进行农田水土保持看起来好像单是农业增产方面的事，对于全地区水土保持所起的作用是不大的，但是如果分析起来，就知道这样的看法是一种错误。如果农田水土保持得宜能使田水不出田的话，对减少一地区从而对减少整个中游地区水土总流失量的贡献将是很大的。
    根据中国科学院黄河中游水土保持综合考察队在晋西和陇中六个重点规划沟全沟流域农田所占总土地面积的百分数，可以说明这一个问题。其中离山县王家沟的开垦百分数为六八点一，兴县蔡家崖五六点九六，河曲县道黄沟六十三，会宁县梢岔沟四一点八，定西县安家沟六八点九五，兰州小金沟三四点一三。以上数字平均是五三点八二。换句话说，就是每流域的面积平均有一半以上为农田所占有。如果全部农田的水土都得到保持，则一个流域的水土总流失量就可以减少到半数以上，整个黄河中游地区的水土流失在很大的程度上就可以得到防止。但是事实上农田水土保持对减少一地区的总水土流失量还不止于此。这一点可就农作物生产本身的特点加以引申。
    农作物生产所要求的重要条件之一就是土壤要经常松动，如播前整地、播种、中耕除草、休闲期耕作等都能使土壤变松。由于土壤松动的结果，在降雨强度小的情况下，对于雨水的透入反倒有利，减少了水土的流失，但在这种情况下本地区并没有水土流失现象发生，如在夏季作物生长和秋季休闲期间；如果降雨强度很大，松动的土壤因抗冲力减小，最容易受到侵蚀，本地区农田水土流失多在这种情况下发生，如在秋季作物生长和夏季休闲期间，尤以夏季休闲地的流失情况更为严重。仅就这一点来说，就可以看到，农田内的水土流失情况远比非农田来得严重。我们在晋西和陇中考察水土保持期间，每逢暴雨以后，就看见农田田面出现无数冲沟，冲沟的数量、深度和宽度都比非农田的荒坡为甚。这是因为荒坡地不但长有野草，而且土壤远较农田致密，所以水的流失虽较多，但土壤则少受侵蚀的缘故；而就农田来说，水和土的流失量二者都较多。根据这种情况推断，如果农田占一地区总面积的50％，实则水土总流失量由农田而来的远不止此数。
    所谓农田水土保持，就是以每一农田为单位（因坡地农田有地坎存在，各田块彼此割裂成确定的单位）进行水土保持，使降落到本田的雨水尽量均匀分布在整个田面并防止各田洪水串流，以达到水不出田的目的。
    由于农田属于农作物栽培管理的范畴，而作物的栽培管理如果能同水土保持利益相结合，则也可以起到一定的水土保持的作用，如深耕、密植、增加土壤的结构等等。但就这一地区农田坡度的分布情况看来（这一地区农田坡度一般在二十度上下），这些措施对于保持农田水土所起的作用是不大的。当然，我们并不反对对这方面措施的注意，因为水土保持的各种措施一般具有累积的效果，即每种措施的施行都将多少发生一定的作用，因此在施行农田水土保持措施的同时，再加上这方面的措施，对农田水土总流失量的减少当也有一定好处。本文所指的农田水土保持措施是指利用小型工程和水土保持耕作两种机械方法以截留水土的措施。这种措施可分为两类，一类为田面措施，一类为田面边界措施。田面措施又分为田面冲沟措施和结合耕作以增加田面粗糙度的措施两种。
    冲沟措施的目的在于防止田面继续破碎割裂，同时减缓田面径流的速度，使其他措施易收截拦水流的效果。田面如有冲沟，水流汇集其中流下，冲沟日益加深，同一块田就被割裂为二。田块这样不断缩小，一方面减削了田块的有效面积，同时对耕作的进行也极不方便。更重要的是就目前利益来讲，如果让冲沟内水流汇集冲下，将会影响到粗糙度和边界两项措施截拦水流的作用。冲沟措施中最有效的是晋西一带有些农民所筑的水簸箕，此外卧牛坑也是一个较好的办法。
    所谓增加田面粗糙度就是结合畜力农具的使用并结合作物栽培的可能性尽量使田面到处变为起伏不平的坑和埂，以起到处处就地拦蓄水流的作用。这一措施同作物生产的结合最为密切。因为如果使雨水均匀分布到农田各处，可使同一田中的作物生长均匀整齐，不致因水流集中流失时，水流流过或累积的地方作物生长过于茂盛甚或淹毙，而大部分田面上作物生长细弱或枯死。增加田面粗糙度的措施在目前行之有效的有垅作区田、水平犁沟、玉米连环堆土、玉米沟垅互变、小麦水平抗冲沟、休闲地犁广沟、谷子三串培土、洋芋垅作、谷子串垅培土等等。这些方法中以水平犁沟适应的条件较为广泛，不拘坡度、作物种类都可以应用。
    田面边界措施是指一田坡向下界所进行的措施。这种措施的目的是为了防止因田面径流量或速度太大，超过冲沟和粗糙度措施所能截留的容量时，而把本田中的水土最后截留，防止田同田间的串流现象。所以边界措施是农田水土保持措施最后的一道防线。边界措施中最有效的是地边埂，此外在有些地方也应用软地埂和“金盆养鱼”法等。1956年我们在甘肃考察期间曾因连日大雨滂沱被阻留在静宁县的界石铺镇数日，据农民谈，像那样的雨如果在以往早就应有山洪暴发，因这一带山上、山下，田田都修了地边埂，所以水土流失就被有效地防止了。根据在界石铺的亲身体会和在其他各处所看到的实际情况，笔者认为地边埂对防止田的水土向外流失确实是很有效的。
    此外地边埂对于梯田的修筑还有很大的帮助，也是值得注意的。
    对水土保持的利益和耕作的方便来说，最理想的当然是把坡地农田变为平坦的梯田。但是梯田的修筑如果用一次变平的办法，因费工太多等原因，就整个中游地区的农田来考虑的话，这可以说是一种奢望。因此梯田可以用筑地边埂的办法，使它达到慢慢变平，这样问题就不大了。因为坡地耕作时一定要向坡向降落的一边翻土，每年翻土的厚度有十到二十厘米之多，再一方面有一部分水土向下流失，因此地边埂附近就逐年淤高。这样随着淤积的厚度逐次把地边埂加高，田面就可以慢慢趋于平缓。用这样的办法修筑梯田，既省工又没有其他风险。修地边埂是一种省力的劳动，并且技术较简单，因此妇女、儿童、老人都可以操作；加之修地边埂必须在雨后（因此时土湿容易拍结实），而雨后一时又不能下地作其他工作，所以青壮年拍地边埂对劳力也不致造成浪费。甘肃有许多农业社一遇雨后全社男男女女都上山拍埂，形成水土保持的热潮。像隆德县的许多农业社拍地埂完全由女社员担任，而且她们的工作质量都达到了很高的标准。
    在进行农田水土保持措施时，以上三方面的措施（如田面无冲沟时，则可略去冲沟措施）一定要全部配合施行，这样方能收到作物增产和田水不出田的效果。有许多地方对农田水土保持仅注意修筑地边埂。这样做是有缺点的。一方面因为同作物生产关系结合不密切，再一方面因上部未行措施，径流量和速度太大，以致地边埂的安全没有保障，容易穿有洞穴。
    农田水土保持措施的进行，如果不能一下全面开花，则也要像进行其他的水土保持措施一样，应该遵照“自上而下”的原则，先由梁峁顶部的农田作起，次第及于沟底。
    根据以上所述，农田水土保持因为既能对黄河中游地区水土总流失量的减少起到很大的作用，又同农民当前的利益密切结合，因此应作为这一地区目前开展水土保持工作的重点，如果各方面条件有限制，农田以外的措施不能很快进行时，则应先从农田全面搞起。当然农田水土保持并不能排斥或代替他种水土保持措施的施行，因为有许多的荒坡地还需要治理。此外，有部分过陡农田，在单位面积产量提高以后，还需要逐步退耕；如果要发展山区经济的多样经营时，也都需要在水土保持原则下，使其他生产事业如林业牧业得到相应的发展。
    黄河中游的水土保持工作虽然因为所要治理的面积很大，是一项艰巨的建设事业，但是我们只要能充分动员广大群众，从关键性的地方下手，也可以迅速收到功效。
