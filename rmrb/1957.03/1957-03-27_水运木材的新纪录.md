    New Record in Water Transport of Timber
    (Reported by this newspaper) Lumberjacks in the large forest areas of Suining and Huitong in Hunan Province have diligently studied advanced Soviet experiences and created new records in water transport of timber. Recently, on the 160-plus-li waterway of the Wushui River, a tributary of the Yuanshui River, they transported over 150,000 railway ties in two shipments, reducing transportation costs by 70.1%, saving over 9,000 yuan in freight, greatly shortening transportation time, and shipping the timber a quarter ahead of schedule.
