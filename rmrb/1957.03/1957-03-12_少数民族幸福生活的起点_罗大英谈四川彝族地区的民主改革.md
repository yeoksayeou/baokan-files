The starting point of a happy life for ethnic minorities
Luo Daying discusses democratic reform in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan

I fully endorse the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li, and Vice Chairman Chen. In particular, I was honored to participate in the Supreme State Conference and hear Chairman Mao's insightful analysis and brilliant instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people, which made me feel very excited. At the same time, Chairman Mao's instructions on ethnic issues at the Supreme State Conference made me even more deeply appreciate the greatness and correctness of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party's ethnic policies, and I felt filled with strength.

Now I will talk about some situations in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan.

Our one million Yi people in Sichuan Province were living in a slave society. Due to the existence of the slave system, all aspects were very backward, especially due to the oppression and exploitation of the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek, which provoked internal strife and created disunity. At the same time, there was mutual oppression within, trafficking in people, and the people lived a life worse than that of cattle and horses. After liberation, thanks to the correct implementation of the Party Central Committee's ethnic policies, regional autonomy was implemented, ethnic divisions were gradually eliminated, and internal feuds among ethnic groups were reasonably resolved, thus creating an atmosphere of unity, equality, and fraternity unprecedented in history. With the development of production, the lives of the masses have also been preliminarily improved. However, due to the existence of the slave system, development in all aspects has been restricted. With the forward development of society and the continuous improvement of the masses' awareness, in actual life, both the upper and lower classes have generally realized that the unreasonable old system is a stumbling block hindering the progress of their ethnic group. The working people are not at ease with production, and incidents of gathering to resist occur constantly, and production cannot be developed, so reform is necessary. Therefore, the people actively demanded reform. At the same time, many upper-class people also requested and sponsored early reform. Throughout the entire process, the policy of peaceful reform was implemented, and upper-class figures were properly resettled.

With the support of the Party and the government, after repeated consultations and discussions, democratic reforms were carried out in the Yi areas of Sichuan Province in February 1956. As of February 1957, the reform has been basically completed. People's lives and all aspects have been improved. We sincerely thank the Party and the government for their infinite concern and help to the Yi people. Now I will introduce the work of democratic reform of ethnic minorities in the Xichang Special District. Xichang is a mixed residential area of ​​many ethnic groups, with a total of 300,000 ethnic minorities, including more than 220,000 Yi people and more than 70,000 other fraternal ethnic groups. The entire region has two autonomous counties, seventeen autonomous regions, one hundred and eighteen ethnic townships, nine mixed-dwelling counties, twenty-eight mixed-dwelling regions, and sixty-three mixed-dwelling townships. Our region started pilot work in Ningnan County in February 1956, and on this basis, steadily carried out reform work in six counties, including Xichang, Dechang, Huili, and Huidong in June. In September, it also launched some areas in the four counties of Yanyuan, Yanbian, Muli, and Jin Mining. As of now, except for the four counties where work was started in September, which are still in progress, reforms have ended in areas with a total population of approximately 140,000, reforms are underway in areas with a population of over 50,000, and reforms are about to begin in areas with a population of over 90,000 (Han Chinese in ethnic minority areas are not included). Looking at the entire process of reform, the policy of peaceful reform has been implemented throughout, and full consultation has been carried out regardless of the early or late stages of reform; there was no digging for hidden wealth, no settling of old scores, no face-to-face struggle, no detention, no killing; for the excess of the four types of property, Ningnan was the only one that collected it, while the other counties purchased it. According to the spirit of the Central Committee not to lower the political treatment and living standards of upper-class figures, slave owners in difficult situations were taken care of in both collection and purchase areas; politically, since August of last year, county-level consultation committees have been established in various counties, and upper-class figures have been properly resettled. Looking at the seven counties that have been reformed, as of the end of last year, 628 people have been resettled and 254 households have been subsidized. With the progress of the work, resettlement and subsidies will continue to be carried out in the future. This fully shows that reform not only did not make the upper class have no way out, but also got a bright future. It is truly so that everyone has food to eat, and those who can do things have things to do. Although a few cadres have made deviations in the implementation of policies and errors in their work during the reform, some are inevitable. After the shortcomings and errors are discovered, they have been corrected or are being corrected. Due to the correctness of the Party's policies and guidelines, the upper class has been further educated, and now the vast majority of people feel that reform is not terrible, and gradually realize the greatness and correctness of the Party, realize the brilliance of Chairman Mao, and realize that long-term unity is the Party's firm and unswerving policy. At the same time, they also realize that reform is the only way for ethnic minorities to seek progress, and is the starting point for the beautiful and happy life of ethnic minority people for generations.

The working people are completely liberated, production is developed, and the unity between and within ethnic groups is strengthened.

After the reform, the working people have been completely liberated, gained personal freedom, and their enthusiasm for labor and organization has been greatly increased. Production has initially developed. According to statistics from the seven counties that have been reformed, thirteen advanced cooperatives, one hundred and seven elementary cooperatives, and one thousand one hundred and seventy-five mutual aid teams have been organized. Judging from the cooperatives that were organized earlier, they generally achieved bumper harvests. For example, the autumn harvest distribution results of eleven cooperatives in Ningnan County showed that production increased in every cooperative, with the highest increasing by 73% and the lowest by 14%, with an average of 30%-50%. Even individual farmers who have undergone reforms have also greatly increased production. With the increase in income, people's lives have also been improved. For example, a survey of 75 cooperative members in the Zhimuguokou Cooperative and the Tuanjie Cooperative in Luoge Township, Ningnan County, found that 65 cooperative members were short of one to eight months of food when they joined the cooperative, accounting for 86% of the total number of cooperative members. In the first year of joining the cooperative, the autumn harvest distribution results showed that only 16 households were short of one to three months of food, accounting for 21% of the total number of cooperative members. Cooperative member Tian Ahei's wife said: "In previous years, we finished eating after harvesting our crops. This year, after joining the cooperative, as long as we are willing to work, we will no longer worry about eating."

Through reform, the unity between and within ethnic groups has also been strengthened. After the awareness of the people of ethnic minorities has been improved, they realize that the root cause of poverty and backwardness is the unreasonable old system and the long-term rule and oppression of the reactionary rulers in history. At the same time, they further realize that the Communist Party is a party that truly seeks liberation and happiness for all ethnic groups. Therefore, they thank the Party and the government from the bottom of their hearts and praise Chairman Mao as "more dear than relatives and better than parents." Due to the improvement of understanding, the ethnic divisions created in history have gradually been eliminated, and ethnic unity has been strengthened. For example, many mixed-residential areas have held get-togethers and seminars to resolve previous divisions and existing problems. In addition, in terms of internal relations among ethnic groups, with the progress of reform, many long-standing feuds and conflicts and contradictions between the upper and lower classes have also been resolved. The above are some situations of democratic reform. Here are two suggestions:

1.  The Yi areas still lack technology. Please ask the government to establish various technical schools in the Yi areas to train ethnic minority technicians.

2.  Some transportation roads have been built, but they are not enough. Please ask the government to vigorously develop transportation in the Yi areas.

These two points are urgently needed and expected by the Yi people. Please correct me if the above statement is not appropriate. (Attached picture)

    少数民族幸福生活的起点
    罗大英谈四川彝族地区的民主改革
    我完全拥护周总理、李副总理、陈副主席的报告。特别是我很光荣地参加了最高国务会议，听到毛主席关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题的精辟分析和英明指示，感到非常兴奋。同时，毛主席在最高国务会议上关于民族问题的指示，使我更加体会到毛主席、共产党的民族政策的伟大正确，我感到全身都充满了力量。
    现在我就四川彝族的一些情况作一发言。
    我们四川省的一百万彝族人民处于奴隶社会。由于奴隶制度的存在，各方面都很落后，特别是由于国民党蒋介石的压迫剥削，挑拨内部打冤家造成不团结。同时内部互相压迫，贩卖人口，人民过着牛马不如的生活。解放后，由于正确贯彻了党中央的民族政策，实行了区域自治，民族隔阂逐渐消除，民族内部的冤家械斗得到了合理解决，因而出现了历史上从未有的团结、平等、友爱的气氛。随着生产的发展，群众生活也得到了初步的改善。但由于奴隶制度的存在，各方面的发展都受到了限制。随着社会的向前发展，群众觉悟的不断提高，在实际的生活中，上下层普遍地认识到不合理的旧制度，是阻碍本民族进步的绊足石。劳动人民不安心生产，集合反抗的事件不断发生，生产得不到发展，必须进行改革。所以人民积极要求改革。在这同时很多上层也请求、赞助早日改革。自始至终贯彻了和平改革方针上层人物都得到了适当的安置
    在党和政府的支持下，经过反复协商讨论后，于1956年2月在四川彝族地区进行民主改革。截至1957年2月止基本上已完成改革了。人民生活和各方面都得到改善了。我们衷心感谢党和政府对彝族人民的无限关怀和帮助。现在我把西昌专区少数民族的民主改革工作介绍一下，西昌是一个多民族的杂居区，少数民族共有三十万人，其中彝族二十二万多，其他兄弟民族七万多人。全区共有二个自治县，十七个自治区，一百一十八个民族乡，九个杂居县，二十八个杂居区，六十三个杂居乡。我区于1956年2月起在宁南县开始了试点工作，在这基础上稳步地于6月开展了西昌、德昌、会理、会东等六县的改革工作。9月又开展了盐源、盐边、木里、金矿四县的部分地区。迄至现在除9月开展工作的四县还正进行外，总计约十四万余人口地区已结束改革，五万余人口地区正在进行改革，九万余人口地区即将开始改革（民族地区的汉族未算在内）。从改革的整个过程来看，自始至终贯彻了和平改革的方针，不论改革的初期与末期都进行了充分的协商；没有挖底财，不算老账，不进行面对面斗争，没有关，没有杀；对于四项财产多余部分除宁南是征收外，其余各县都是征购。根据中央不降低上层人物政治待遇和生活水平的精神，不论征收或征购地区对有困难的奴隶主都进行了照顾；在政治上从去年8月起，各县先后建立了县的协商委员会，上层人物得到了适当的安置，从已改的七个县来看，截至去年年底已安置六百二十八人，补贴了二百五十四户。随着工作的进展，今后还将陆续进行安置与补贴。这充分说明改革不仅没有使上层无出路，而且得到了光明的前途，真所谓使人人有饭吃，能做事的都有事做。改革中虽然已发生过少数干部执行政策上的偏差和工作的错误，但有些是不可避免的。缺点错误被发觉后，都已作了纠正或正在进行纠正。由于党的政策方针的正确，进一步教育了上层，现绝大多数人已感到改革并不可怕，逐渐认识到党的伟大、正确，认识到毛主席的英明，认识到长期团结是党坚决不移的方针。同时也认识到改革是少数民族谋求进步的唯一道路，是少数民族人民世世代代美好幸福生活的起点。劳动人民彻底解放，生产发展民族间和民族内部的团结加强
    改革后，劳动人民得到了彻底解放，获得了人身自由，劳动和组织起来的热情大大提高，生产已初步得到了发展，据已改七个县的统计，已组织了高级社十三个，初级社一百零七个，互助组一千一百七十五个。从组织较早的社看来，一般都获得丰收。如宁南县十一个社秋收分配结果，社社增产，其中最高的增产73％，最低的14％，平均也在30％—50％。就是单干农户，凡是经过改革的也都有很大增产。随着收入的增加，人民生活也得到了改善，如宁南县倮格乡支木果口社和团结社七十五户社员的调查，入社时有六十五户社员缺一至八个月口粮，占社员总户数的86％，入社第一年，秋收分配结果只有十六户缺一至三个月口粮，占社员总户数的21％。社员田阿黑的女人说：“往年我们的庄稼收完吃完，今年入社后，只要肯劳动再也不愁吃了。”
    通过改革，民族间和民族内部的团结也加强了。少数民族人民觉悟提高后，认识到贫穷落后的根本原因，是不合理的旧制度及历史上的反动统治者长期统治、压迫造成的。同时也进一步认识到，共产党是真正为各族人民谋求解放、谋求幸福的党。因而，从内心感谢党和政府，赞颂毛主席“比亲人还亲，比父母还好”。由于认识的提高，历史上所造成的民族隔阂也逐渐消除，民族团结已增强了：如很多杂居区曾先后举行联欢会、座谈会等，解除了以往的隔阂与存在问题。此外，在民族内部关系上，随着改革的进展，很多以往悬而未决的冤家纠纷及上下层的冲突矛盾也随之得到解决。以上是民主改革的一些情况。兹提出两点建议：
    一、彝族地区还缺乏技术，请政府在彝族地区创办各种技术学校，培养少数民族技术人员；
    二、交通道路已经修了一些，但还不够，请政府大力在彝族地区发展交通事业。
    这两点是目前彝族人民迫切需要而期待着的。以上发言是否妥当，请指正。（附图片）
