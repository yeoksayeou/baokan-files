My Thoughts After Returning to the Motherland
Liu Zaifu speaks to Kuomintang friends and overseas Chinese in Taiwan

　　I was once elected as a member of the first National Assembly of the Republic of China and lived in Beijing for several years. Returning to this old place, it has become a capital of an era, and I am extremely excited.

　　I came to Beijing last November. At that time, my stomach ulcer had just recovered, and it was not suitable for traveling far. However, the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth was held in Beijing. As a believer of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, I was very excited to receive the invitation. Furthermore, the enthusiastic urging of comrades in charge of the reception made me disregard the fatigue of the long journey and resolutely came north. As expected, I fell ill on the train. Although I couldn't participate in the conference, I fully understood the grandness and scale of the commemorative activities, and more importantly, the great significance the national leadership attached to commemorating this great figure. After the commemorative meeting, I stayed in my hotel room due to illness. Recently, my spirits have been particularly low, and I have been unable to go out. I have not engaged in any personal political activities. I did not expect that this National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) would ask me to attend in the last few days. The enthusiasm of friends and the active and swift actions of the authorities to mobilize and unite all forces that can be mobilized and united moved me greatly. I had been invited to attend twice before, but I was unable to come due to various reasons. Now, although I am ill, I must make an effort to attend.

　　Since the opening of this conference, I have read the speeches of the representatives in the newspapers. The content ranges from politics to economics, from philosophy to literature and art, from science to education… it can be said that everything is covered. What is particularly noteworthy is that all the speeches are filled with a precious democratic spirit, speaking freely and without reservation. Confucius once lamented: "To serve a ruler with undue frequency leads to disgrace; to associate with friends with undue frequency leads to estrangement." This shows that it was absolutely impossible in the old society for everyone to speak their minds freely. But now it has been achieved. The Communist Party advocates criticism and self-criticism, not as a mere show, but in a truly consistent manner. Coming back to the motherland this time, I have felt this even more deeply. Chairman Mao instructed that contradictions among the people can be resolved through persuasion, which can also be proven by this.

　　Here, I would like to say a few words to the Kuomintang friends in Taiwan. The Taiwan issue is of course China's internal affair. Just like a quarrel between brothers, only peacemakers are welcome, and no outside interference or encroachment is allowed. Human beings are always rational animals. I believe that the wisdom and virtue of our friends in Taiwan will ultimately prevail, and they will eventually embark on the brightest path.

　　My hometown is an overseas Chinese hometown, so naturally, I would also like to say a few words to overseas Chinese. Now, our country has continued Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution and has become a world-recognized first-class power. Reading Premier Zhou's report on his visit to eleven Asian and European countries at the conference, I feel even more the magnificent spirit and great achievements of our country's diplomacy, which inspires people infinitely. Overseas Chinese are the most patriotic. The great German poet Schiller once wrote the following lines: "The power of longing for one's homeland is unparalleled!" I believe that all overseas Chinese will have ardent faith and expectations for the government. (Picture attached)

### 我回到祖国后的感想　刘栽甫向台湾的国民党朋友和侨胞说几句话

　　我回到祖国后的感想
　　刘栽甫向台湾的国民党朋友和侨胞说几句话
    我曾当选民国第一届国会议员，居住北京数年，此次旧地重临，已成为划时代的首都，感奋何极。
    我是去年11月来到北京的。那时我的胃溃疡才痊愈不久，本来是不适宜远行的，但孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念大会在京举行，我是孙中山先生的一个信仰者，接到邀请，感觉十分兴奋，加以招待同志的热诚催促，就不惮长途舟车的困顿，毅然北来。果然在火车上就病倒了，虽不能参加大会，但也充分明了纪念活动的隆重和规模的宏大，更了解国家的领导方面纪念这位伟大人物的重大意义。纪念会结束后，我一直卧病旅邸，最近精神尤差，不能出门，始终未有个人的政治活动。没有想到这次全国政协会议临到最后几天，还要我来列席，朋友的热情和当局处事的积极迅速，动员和团结一切可以动员和团结的力量，使我非常感动。过去曾两次邀我出席，均因事未克前来，现虽有病在身，也要勉强一到。
    这次大会开幕以后，我在报纸上读到各位代表的发言，内容从政治到经济，从哲学到文艺，从科学到教育……可谓应有尽有，无所不包。特别值得重视的是，所有的发言，字里行间，弥漫着一种异常可贵的民主精神，知无不言，言无不尽。孔子曾经慨叹：“事君数，斯辱矣。朋友数，斯疏矣。”可见使人人都能畅所欲言，在旧社会是绝对办不到的。但现在已经做到了。共产党提倡批评与自我批评，并不是装点门面，而实在是表里如一。我这次回到祖国来，就更深切地感到这一点。毛主席指示说，人民内部矛盾可以用说服方式来解决，也可以由此得到证明。
    在这里，我想向台湾的国民党朋友说几句话。台湾问题，当然是中国的内政问题。就像兄弟争吵一样，只有和事佬，绝不容任何外人操纵和侵犯的。人类总是理性动物，我想，台湾朋友的智慧和德业，是到底存在的，他们终将走上最光明的大道。
    我的故乡是一个侨乡，因此，很自然的，我也想向侨胞说几句话。现在，我国已继续孙中山先生的革命，成为举世公认的一等强国。读到大会上周总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告，愈觉我国外交的雄伟气魄和伟大成就，使人心无限奋发。侨胞是最富于爱国心的。德国大诗人席勒曾写下这样的诗句：“故国之思的力量无比！”我相信一切侨胞对政府必将有热烈的信仰与期待。（附图片）
