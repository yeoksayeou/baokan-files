Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 18th. A waste product procurement conference held by the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Tianjin has determined that in the future, all waste materials that should be and can be utilized should be acquired to support national economic construction.

The conference, which concluded today, requires the waste product procurement departments of supply and marketing cooperatives in all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions to comprehensively develop and strengthen the acquisition of waste steel, waste rubber, rags, scrap copper, and other waste products, and to strive to complete a waste product procurement task worth 350 million yuan this year. This task is proposed on the basis of the total value of waste products purchased in 1956, which was more than 320 million yuan. The vast majority of waste products acquired last year have already been used in industrial production. The scrap copper acquired last year can be smelted into 38,000 tons of refined copper, which can be supplied to industrial departments for manufacturing more than 42,000 300-kilowatt generators; the acquired waste steel can be smelted into more than 380,000 tons of steel, which can be used to manufacture 7.5 million double-wheeled double-shared plows or 75,000 tractors; the acquired rags can be made into 36,000 tons of pulp, replacing 200,000 cubic meters of wood.

The person in charge of the Waste Products General Administration of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives said at the meeting that the supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions conducted a relatively comprehensive survey and research on the waste product resources in their respective regions last year. The results show that waste product resources are very abundant. The total value of potential waste products in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai is more than 249 million yuan, while the total value of waste products acquired in these three cities last year accounted for only 16%. In addition, with the development of national construction and the gradual improvement of people's living standards, new waste product resources will increase day by day. Therefore, it is required that all localities do a good job in publicity, mobilize various social forces, and comprehensively carry out waste product acquisition work.

The meeting also pointed out that some regions had once experienced compulsory order deviations in the acquisition process, and many regions had the phenomenon of paying attention to large quantities, neglecting small quantities, and neglecting going deep into residents to carry out acquisitions. Attention should be paid to correcting these shortcomings in the future.

    供销社今年将用三亿五千万元
    收购一切可利用的废品
    新华社天津18日电　中华全国供销合作总社在天津举行的废品采购会议确定，今后要把一切应该收购、可以利用的废弃物资都收购起来，支援国家经济建设。
    今天结束的这个会议，要求全国各省、市、自治区的供销合作社废品采购部门，全面开展和加强废钢材、废橡胶和破布、杂铜等废品的收购工作，在今年内努力完成三亿五千万元的废品采购任务。这个任务是在1956年采购废品总值三亿二千多万元的基础上提出来的。去年收购的废品绝大部分已经用到工业生产上去。去年收购的杂铜，能冶炼成精铜三万八千吨，可以供给工业部门用以制造四万二千多台三百瓩的发电机；收购的废钢铁，可以炼钢材三十八万多吨，用以制造七百五十万部双轮双铧犁或七万五千台拖拉机；收购的破布可以制成纸浆三万六千吨，代替二十万立方公尺木材。
    全国供销合作总社废品总管理局的负责人在会上说：各地供销社去年对所在地区的废品资源作了一次较全面的调查研究，结果证明废品资源很丰富。北京、天津、上海三市潜藏的废品总值就有二亿四千九百多万元，而这三个市去年收购的废品总值只占16％。加上国家建设事业的发展和人民生活水平逐渐提高，新的废品资源会日益增多。因此要求各地作好宣传工作，动员各种社会力量，全面地开展废品收购工作。
    会议还指出，某些地区在收购中曾一度发生强迫命令的偏向，不少地区在收购中存在着重视大宗、轻视小宗以及忽视深入到居民中去收购的现象，对这些缺点今后要注意加以纠正。
