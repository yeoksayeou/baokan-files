Xinhua News Agency, March 15th: Amman dispatch: Demonstrations and parades were held in all cities and villages of Jordan on the 14th to celebrate the termination of the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty.

    Several thousand people and delegations from other cities participated in the parade in the capital Amman. King Hussein and Prime Minister Nabulsi and others reviewed the parade. The marching crowds held up various banners with slogans such as "The termination of the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty is the result of the martyrs' bloodshed and sacrifice," "We want a liberated Arab League," "Long live the liberated Gaza of the Arabs." The demonstrators also distributed leaflets demanding that the government reject the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and establish relations with China and the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, March 15th: According to TASS, Istanbul, March 14th: The attempt by the United States to get Lebanon to accept the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" has aroused strong opposition from Lebanese patriots. Beirut newspapers have published many articles exposing the "Eisenhower Doctrine" as a means of enslaving Arab countries, and as a means for American oil monopolies and concerns to plunder and seize the national wealth of these countries.

    Leaflets opposing this conspiracy of U.S. imperialism have been distributed in Beirut. Many people's delegations have visited some of Lebanon's most famous politicians, demanding that they not accept the so-called aid from the United States in the name of the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

    When Lebanese Foreign Minister Malik returned to Beirut from the United States, he was greeted by anti-imperialist demonstrations. A Lebanese university student, in a speech at the airport before being arrested by the police, pointed out that the Lebanese people should regard Lebanese Foreign Minister Malik as the representative of the United States in Lebanon, not as a Lebanese diplomat.

    庆祝终止英约条约  反对艾森豪威尔主义
    约旦全国举行示威游行
    黎巴嫩爱国人士反对接受美国奴役中东计划
    据新华社15日讯  安曼消息：约旦全国各城市和乡村14日举行了示威游行，庆祝终止英约条约。
    首都安曼的游行有几千来自其他城市的人们和代表团参加。国王侯赛因和首相纳布西等检阅了游行队伍。游行队伍高举着各种标语，上面写着：“英约条约终止是烈士们流血牺牲的成果”，“我们要一个解放了的阿拉伯国家联盟”，“阿拉伯人的解放了的加沙万岁”。游行者还散发了传单要求政府拒绝 “艾森豪威尔主义”和同中国、苏联建立关系。
    新华社15日讯  据塔斯社伊斯坦布尔14日讯：美国要黎巴嫩接受所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”的企图引起了黎巴嫩爱国人士的强烈反对。贝鲁特的报纸刊载了许多文章，揭露“艾森豪威尔主义”是奴役阿拉伯国家的手段之一，是美国石油垄断组织和康采恩想掠夺和侵占这些国家的民族财富的手段。
    贝鲁特有人散发传单，反对美帝国主义的这个阴谋。许多人民代表团去拜访黎巴嫩最有名的一些政治家，要求他们不要接受美国在 “艾森豪威尔主义”名义下给予的所谓援助。
    黎巴嫩外交部长马利克从美国回到贝鲁特时，迎接他的是反帝示威游行。一个黎巴嫩大学生在被警察逮捕之前在机场上发表的演说中曾经指出，黎巴嫩人民应该把黎巴嫩外交部长马利克看作美国在黎巴嫩的代表，而不是黎巴嫩的外交官。
