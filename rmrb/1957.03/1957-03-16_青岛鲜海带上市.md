    Fresh Kelp from Qingdao Enters the Market
    Xinhua News Agency: Workers at the Shandong Aquatic Products Farm have made their first trial harvest of a large quantity of fresh kelp from the sea off Qingdao, which is now available on the Qingdao market. According to the head of the production department of the farm, they can harvest five to six thousand catties of fresh kelp every day from mid-March onwards.
    In order to supply fresh kelp earlier, the farm changed the seedling cultivation area during the seedling period last year, and sent people to the sea off Dalian in September to cultivate a portion of kelp seedlings. They began transplanting seedlings in the sea off Qingdao in mid-December, nearly a month earlier than the kelp transplanting period of the previous year's cultivation.
    This year, the Shandong Aquatic Products Farm has increased the area of artificial kelp cultivation in the sea off Qingdao alone by more than 500 mu compared to last year, with a total output of more than 7 million catties, an increase of nearly 100% compared to last year.

    青岛鲜海带上市
    新华社讯  山东水产养殖场的工人们已从青岛海面第一次试采了大批鲜海带，供应青岛市场。据这个场生产部负责人说，进入中旬以后，每天可以采到鲜海带五、六千斤。
    这个养殖场为了提早供应鲜海带，在去年育苗期间曾改变了育苗地区，9月间派人到大连海面育了一部分海带苗，12月中旬开始在青岛海面上分苗，分苗期比去年养殖的海带分苗期提早了将近一个月。
    山东水产养殖场今年人工养殖海带的面积仅在青岛海面即比去年增加了五百多亩，总产量七百多万斤，比去年增产近一倍。
