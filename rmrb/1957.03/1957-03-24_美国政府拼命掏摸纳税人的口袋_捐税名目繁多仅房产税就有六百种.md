Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 23rd: United Press International, in estimating the prospects for the next U.S. fiscal year, wrote that the $71.8 billion budget for the 1957-1958 U.S. fiscal year "only means one thing: increasingly higher taxes."

UPI said: "Not only is the federal government frantically raiding taxpayers' pockets, but state and municipal authorities are also improving their 'taxing techniques.'"

UPI said that the total amount of taxes levied by state authorities has more than doubled since the end of World War II. This figure has almost tripled compared to the pre-war year of 1939. There are numerous tax items, including so-called local taxes, consumption taxes, sales taxes, inheritance taxes, and so on. There are about one hundred kinds of taxes levied on eggs, one hundred and sixteen kinds of taxes on men's clothing, one hundred and fifty kinds of taxes on women's hats, and six hundred kinds of property taxes. In thirty-one states, in addition to federal income tax, state income tax is also levied.

UPI concluded: "Everywhere there are taxes, taxes, taxes. No matter what you do or what your profession is, before the end of the year, someone will always come and fleece you one way or another."

    美国政府拼命掏摸纳税人的口袋
    捐税名目繁多仅房产税就有六百种
    据新华社23日讯　纽约消息：合众社在估计美国下一个财政年度的前景的时候写道，为数七百一十八亿美元的1957—1958年美国财政年度的预算“只意味着一个事实：捐税的日益增加”。
    合众社说：“不仅联邦政府拼命掏摸纳税人的口袋，就是各州和市政当局也在改进它们‘征税的技巧’”。
    合众社说，第二次世界大战结束以来，各州当局所征收的捐税总额提高了一倍以上。这个数字比战前1939年几乎增加了三倍。捐税名目繁多，有所谓地方税、消费税、销售税、遗产税等等。对蛋类征收的各种捐税约有一百种，男人服装税——一百一十六种，妇女帽子税——一百五十种，房产税——六百种。在三十一个州内除了要征联邦所得税外，还要征收州的所得税。
    合众社最后说：“到处都是税、税、税，不管你做什么，也不管你的职业是什么，在一年年底之前，总有人会用这种或那种方式狠狠地来捞你一把”。
