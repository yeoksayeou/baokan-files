Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 1st: At the opening meeting of the First All-Union Congress of Soviet Artists on the 28th, Soviet People's Artist Yogananson delivered a report on the situation and tasks of Soviet fine arts, and Shepilov delivered a congratulatory message to the congress on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

In his report to the congress, Yogananson said that the October Revolution created conditions for the free development of literature and art, enabling artists to fully serve the people and fight together with their people for the great communist ideals.

After reviewing the path of development and achievements of Soviet art, Yogananson said that this congress will be an extremely important milestone in the history of Soviet fine arts' development along the path of socialist realism. The task of the Soviet Artists Association, which will be established at this congress, is to unite the ranks of thousands of oil painters, sculptors, ink painters, and folk art masters to complete the tasks set forth by the people and the Communist Party.

Next, Shepilov read the congratulatory message from the CPSU Central Committee.

The congratulatory message said that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regards truly popular and realistic art as a huge force for promoting the cultural growth of the Soviet people and assisting the Party in educating the working people with communist ideas.

Soviet artists are confidently advancing along the path of socialist realism, which is deeply ideological, possesses perfect form, and is closely connected with the masses of working people, based on the progressive artistic creations of the homeland and the world.

However, there are still some serious shortcomings in the development of Soviet art. For example, there are not enough works that reflect the vitality, daily life, and struggle of Soviet people in building a communist society with great artistic appeal. The image and spiritual world of Soviet people have not been profoundly and comprehensively expressed. Many gray, gloomy, and bland works have also appeared in art creation, etc.

The Communist Party calls on Soviet artists to engage in inspiring labor, give full play to bold creativity and initiative, constantly enrich the forms, styles, types, and genres of socialist realism art, and unremittingly struggle against aesthetic formalism tendencies, naturalistic pseudo-realism, hypocrisy, bombast, and other phenomena incompatible with socialist realism.

The congratulatory message requires the Artists Association to focus on ideological and artistic skills, build all its work on the basis of democratic methods, and use all means to promote the broad initiative of artists.

According to the agenda adopted by the congress, in addition to Yogananson's main report, the congress will also hear and discuss sub-reports on issues such as oil painting, ink painting, sculpture, propaganda posters, stage art, art research, and criticism, and will adopt the charter of the Artists Association and elect the association's leadership, etc. The meeting will last eight days.

    苏共中央号召苏联美术家从事鼓舞人心的劳动
    约甘桑作了关于苏联造型艺术情况和任务的报告
    据新华社莫斯科1日电  在苏联第一届全国美术家代表大会28日开幕会议上，苏联人民艺术家约甘桑作了关于苏联造型艺术的情况和任务的报告，谢皮洛夫代表苏联共产党中央委员会向代表大会致贺词。
    约甘桑向大会作的报告中说，十月革命为文学和艺术的自由发展创造了条件，使美术家有充分可能来全心全意地为人民服务，同自己的人民一起为伟大的共产主义思想奋斗。
    约甘桑在回顾了苏联美术发展的道路和取得的成就后说，这次代表大会将成为苏联造型艺术沿着社会主义现实主义道路发展的历史上的极重要的里程碑。将在这次代表大会上成立的苏联美术家协会的任务是把成千上万的油画家、雕刻家、水墨画家、民间艺术大师的队伍团结起来，完成人民和共产党提出的任务。
    接着，谢皮洛夫宣读了苏共中央的贺词。
    贺词说，苏联共产党把真正人民的、现实主义的艺术看作是一支促进苏联人民文化成长、协助党以共产主义思想教育劳动人民的巨大力量。
    苏联美术家在祖国的和世界的进步艺术创作的基础上满怀信心地沿着富有深刻的思想性、具备完美的形式、同劳动人民群众有紧密联系的社会主义现实主义的艺术道路前进。
    但是，在发展苏维埃造型艺术方面目前还存在着一些严重缺点。例如：以巨大的艺术感染力反映苏维埃人的生命力、日常生活和建设共产主义社会的斗争的作品还不多，苏维埃人的形象和精神世界还没有被深刻和全面地表现出来，在美术创作上也出现不少灰色的、阴暗的、平淡无味的作品等。
    共产党号召苏联美术家从事鼓舞人心的劳动，发挥大胆的创造性和主动精神，不断丰富社会主义现实主义艺术的形式、风格、种类和体裁，并且同唯美形式主义倾向，同自然主义伪现实主义，同虚伪、浮夸作风以及其他跟社会主义现实主义不相容的现象作不懈的斗争。
    贺词要求美术家协会应该把思想倾向问题和艺术技巧问题作为注意的中心，把自己的全部工作建立在民主方式的基础上，用一切方法发挥美术家的广泛积极性。
    根据大会通过的议程，除约甘桑的主要报告以外，大会还将听取和讨论有关油画、水墨画、雕刻、宣传画、舞台布景艺术、美术研究和批评等问题的副报告，并且将通过美术家协会章程和选举协会的领导机构等。会议将举行八天。
