Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 25th (TASS dispatch): The following is a summary of the speech delivered by Kuznetsov, head of the Soviet delegation to the UN General Assembly, at the Special Political Committee of the 11th session of the UN General Assembly on February 25, 1957.

The Soviet delegation submitted to the UN General Assembly for discussion the issue of US interference in the internal affairs of People's Democracies and US hostile subversion activities against these countries.

The Soviet Union, as a member state of the United Nations, considers it its duty to bring the above issues to the attention of all member states of the United Nations, because the increasing US interference in the internal affairs of other countries will lead to the deterioration of international relations, complicate the international situation, and contain extremely dangerous consequences for universal peace and the security of all peoples.

The Soviet Union submits this issue to the General Assembly for discussion in the hope of eliminating such situations in international relations that hinder normal international cooperation, thereby helping to improve international relations and ease international tensions.

Interference in the Internal Affairs of Other Countries is an Integral Part of Current US Policy

The US government's reliance on its direct agents and various anti-people sabotage organizations to carry out peace-threatening interference in the internal affairs of other countries is by no means an accidental phenomenon. Such interference is an integral part of the current aggressive foreign policy of the United States.

The US imperialist bloc is unwilling to consider the actual situation, nor is it willing to consider the existence of peace-loving socialist countries, but is plotting to restore the capitalist system in these countries.

The US reactionary bloc wants to obstruct the development and consolidation of young socialist countries, hinder the improvement of the living standards of the people of socialist countries, and strive to maintain an atmosphere of tension and strengthen the threat of a new world war in Europe and the world by organizing sabotage activities and counter-revolutionary activities of the remnants of the exploiting classes in the People's Democracies.

The policy of irreconcilability with socialist countries is reflected in the establishment of military blocs and alliances at the instigation of the United States—the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the ANZUS Treaty, and other similar aggressive and exclusive groups led by the United States. This policy is also manifested in the establishment by the United States of many military bases on the territory of other countries that threaten universal security, strengthening the expansion of armaments, and opposing any practical proposals aimed at reducing armaments and banning weapons of mass destruction.

The so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" is one of the most recent manifestations of this policy of blatant interference in the internal affairs of other countries. The US government is attempting to establish US colonial rule in the Middle East and Near East countries through the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and to obstruct the development of equal and mutually beneficial economic and cultural cooperation between Asian and African countries and the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.

In terms of economic ties, the policy of carrying out sabotage activities against other countries, especially socialist countries, is manifested in the US forcing its military bloc partners to adopt discriminatory measures in their trade with socialist countries. The actual situation shows that this practice of hindering international trade and economic ties primarily harms Western countries themselves, and it also hinders the normalization of the situation, which is an unfriendly act under peaceful conditions.

At the same time, the US leadership group is launching large-scale slanderous propaganda, inciting hostility and hatred towards the peace-loving socialist countries. They are trying to build strict barriers between the free socialist countries and the people of other countries, hindering cultural ties between them.

The US leadership group is extremely opposed to and rejects any proposals aimed at improving relations between the United States and the peace-loving countries. They have formulated plans to carry out subversive activities against socialist countries, and are trying to implement these plans.

Instigating Subversion Activities Against Socialist Countries Elevated to the Status of US National Policy

Government documents that have been made public and a large amount of evidence of US spy organizations uncovered in socialist countries show that the subversive activities against the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, and Albania are instigated and directed by US officials, who regard such activities as an integral part of their foreign policy.

As everyone knows, the US Congress openly allocates funds for sabotage activities against other countries, which is unprecedented in the relations between countries with normal diplomatic relations.

According to the so-called "Mutual Security" Act of 1951, the US Congress annually allocates 100 million US dollars for subversive activities against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. In the past few years, the US government has allocated several hundred million US dollars for the above purposes in accordance with this law. In 1956, this annual expenditure increased to 125 million US dollars.

These appropriations are naturally only a small part of the funds actually spent by US state organs on "secret wars" against peace-loving countries. US newspapers pointed out that the United States spends several billion US dollars annually on the above purposes in various aspects.

There is every reason to call the above-mentioned law the Subversion Law, because this law states bluntly that the allocated funds should be used to subsidize "any selected person residing in or fleeing from the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania... or to organize them into armed forces to support the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or for other purposes."

More detailed explanations of the sinister purpose of US government funding can be found in the remarks of many US politicians.

Mr. Kersten is the drafter of the part of this bill that has been implemented. Speaking in the House of Representatives, he defined the US policy toward countries where working people are in power as follows:

"The Mutual Security Act, recently agreed to and signed by the President, provides for methods of US aid to underground liberation movements in communist countries. These principles are all included in the amendment I proposed in the House of Representatives, which has been passed..." Kersten said: "The amendment I proposed to the Mutual Security Act stipulates that assistance should be given to those existing or future underground organizations. These underground organizations can be led so that their activities will not be in vain."

Kersten emphasized, "To say that terrorist means will not play any role in the liberation movement in Eastern Europe is to be unfamiliar with the nature of the liberation movement..." Kersten also said that the purpose of this US policy is to "spread fear."

Kersten believes that "the goal of liberation cannot be achieved by propaganda and parliamentary means alone, it requires violent action at the appropriate time."

It can be seen from this that, according to this US plan, the Eastern European countries should be "liberated" from the people's democratic system by violence with the active participation of the United States, for example, with the help of terrorist and sabotage actions.

Senator McCarran, explaining the intention of this type of action to the Senate, said that the United States "propaganda can only produce results in a consistent manner by pursuing a clear and bold purpose, that is, to subvert the Soviet dictatorship by all means at our disposal..." McCarran openly demanded "maximum support for sabotage and riot groups in communist-controlled areas." In this regard, he suggested that the US government should use all organizations and groups for camouflage; he said, "There is no reason why our own offensive should be limited to government action. The government cannot openly do everything that private groups can do in peacetime..." "It is possible to incite riots in puppet areas."

As everyone knows, the UN General Assembly has already discussed the issue of subversive activities at its sixth and seventh sessions in 1951 and 1952. At that time, some UN member states noted the aggressive nature of the US 1951 Act and suggested requesting the United States to stop interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.

However, the US ruling bloc, ignoring the calls of world opinion, launched even more rampant sabotage activities against the People's Democracies. They passed new bills aimed at intensifying interference in the internal affairs of other countries and further launching hostile activities against the People's Democracies.

In 1955, the United States drafted a detailed plan for sabotage activities - "A Plan for Political Offensive Against World Communism." This plan expressly stipulates the organization, support and supply of armed counter-revolutionary bandits in the People's Democracies. The purpose of doing so is to use these armed bandits, composed of various criminals and traitors, to organize treasonous riots.

David Sarnoff, chairman of the board of directors of "Radio Corporation of America," one of the largest US companies and the drafter of this plan, wrote shamelessly and openly in his memorandum on this issue: "It is hoped to maximize the use of this manpower... They should be attracted to some well-organized and well-funded anti-communist organization... A formal corps of exiled officers should be established, with groups ranging from ten to one hundred people, but they must be prepared to be used at any time under very special circumstances." The plan stipulates the organization of extensive underground activities in the People's Democracies to incite citizens of these countries to betray their motherland.

As everyone knows, this detailed plan for subversive activities against the People's Democracies and the Soviet Union has been discussed by senior US government officials and has received their full approval. This plan has also been printed in the official collection of documents of the US Congress - "Congressional Record".

US government leaders, after 1951, continued to openly support subversive activities against the legally elected governments of the peoples of socialist countries in their speeches, and continued to call for the restoration of the capitalist system that had been abandoned by the people of these countries.

In 1952, Mr. Dulles formulated his so-called policy of "liberating" socialist countries. Mr. Dulles believed that the purpose of this US policy should be to revive capitalism in the People's Democracies. At that time, Dulles said: "Work aimed at promoting liberation must be carried out properly everywhere. Of course, this activity cannot be public."

At that time, Mr. Dulles was not yet the Secretary of State. Later, after Mr. Dulles took on this high official position, he indeed realized his long-cherished wish, and he repeatedly declared that this subversive activity was the policy of the US government.

When Secretary of State Dulles spoke to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on January 15, 1953, he suggested shifting from the policy of "containing Russia" to a more active so-called liberation policy, because he believed that the former was not enough. When he spoke to the House Foreign Affairs Committee on April 5, 1954, he assured members of Congress that the US government would never abandon this policy of subversion as long as the current situation remained in the People's Democracies. Mr. Dulles revealed the intention of the "liberation" policy, saying: "The United States cannot have real peace" as long as the socialist system exists in these countries.

When the Secretary of State spoke to the reactionary ringleaders who had been driven out of the People's Democracies on January 9 last year, he again spoke on his favorite topic, reiterating that the United States "is committed to the liberation of communist countries and will never compromise."

Later, this policy of subversion can also be seen in the so-called Christmas greetings issued by the US President and Secretary of State to the Eastern European countries. By the way, the direct intention of these greetings spread through the "Radio Free Europe" is to incite the people of Poland, Romania, Hungary, and other People's Democracies to overthrow the current governments of these countries, change the social system, and restore the order favored by the US ruling bloc in these countries.

A special statement from the White House on December 30, 1955 pointed out that the so-called "liberation" of the people of the People's Democracies "will always be one of the main goals of US foreign policy until it is achieved."

What does the US ruling bloc mean when they agitate for the so-called liberation of the people of socialist countries?

As everyone knows, there is public ownership of the means of production in socialist countries. The land, minerals and factories of these countries are all the property of the entire working people. The national economy is developing rapidly, and the material welfare of the people is constantly growing. In these countries, all political power is in the hands of the working people, who enjoy real freedom - freedom from exploitation.

What the planners of the so-called "liberation" policy hope to do is to overthrow the people's democratic system that the working people of the People's Democracies have chosen themselves and that is in line with their fundamental interests. They dream of restoring the power of landlords and capitalists in socialist countries and once again turning the people of these countries into objects of cruel exploitation.

The United States is the Organizer of Subversive Activities Against Socialist Countries

Some US national leaders hypocritically declare that the enacted laws on allocating funds for organizing sabotage activities and activities inciting riots against the governments elected by the people of these countries are not themselves evidence of subversive activities and interference in the internal affairs of these countries.

But the facts show that the US government has blatantly trampled on international law, consistently insisted on carrying out subversive activities against other peace-loving countries in accordance with the enacted laws and the statements of national leaders, and elevated these activities to the level of official national policy.

US officials are widely engaged in cultivating backbones for subversive activities in the People's Democracies. Whether in the United States or in several Western European countries, many espionage and sabotage organizations have been established and continue to be established by the United States with US funds for the above purposes. These organizations have headquarters in the United States and are closely linked to relevant US government agencies. These agencies provide them with funding and instructions.

One of the US government agencies that carries out subversive activities against other countries is the Central Intelligence Agency, headed by Mr. Allen Dulles. This agency is primarily involved in sending saboteurs to the territory of other countries, supplying weapons to secret bandits, and preparing activities for armed anti-government riots. This was particularly evident in the recent events in Hungary.

Among the organizations organized by the US Central Intelligence Agency to undermine and subvert the governments of free European countries, the "Free Europe Committee" and the "Crusade for Freedom" play an important role. Prominent officials and industrial and financial oligarchs Allen Dulles, General Clay, and billionaire Rockefeller are the founders and leaders of the "Crusade for Freedom" organization.

The "Free Europe Committee" was established during the tension of the "Cold War," and its activities are closely related to the "Crusade for Freedom."

These organizations are among the centers used by intelligence agencies to fund various expatriate, espionage, and terrorist groups and guide their activities.

In order to lead the activities of organizations and sabotage groups carrying out subversive activities against the Soviet Union, the "American Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of the USSR" was established in 1951, with its headquarters in New York. Among the more famous leaders of this organization are: former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Alan Kirk, and prominent staff members of the former State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, such as Hall Sejing.

In February of this year, a subversive group called "Citizens' Committee on Foreign Relations" was organized in Washington. The leaders of this organization are General Wedemeyer, Colonel Julius Amos, James Cromwell, and Charles Edison. US newspapers reported that the mission of this committee is to actively promote subversive activities in the People's Democracies.

US newspapers said that in order to achieve the purpose of subversion, "commando teams" have even been established in the United States. These are composed of small teams. The 77th team is stationed at Fort Bragg, and the 10th Task Force has been dispatched to the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany. Casual visitors to Fort Bragg in the United States would be very surprised to see junior officers giving orders in Polish, Czech, Russian, German, and other languages.

These troops are all receiving specialized training: training them in the ability to form groups of no more than fifteen people to carry out independent activities, as well as methods of infiltrating foreign territory to organize sabotage and slowdowns.

The tasks of these "special groups" can be judged from the recent events in Hungary, which were instigated and provoked from the outside. The mission of these groups in Hungary was to carry out criminal terrorist acts to sabotage the organs of the worker-peasant regime and murder certain citizens.

The United States has allocated large sums of money as funding for organizing and maintaining many groups in Western European countries that carry out subversive activities against socialist countries.

The Federal Republic of Germany provides many particularly convenient conditions for these groups to carry out despicable activities. For example, there is an "American Committee for Liberation" in Munich. This committee distributes leaflets such as "Our Common Cause" and "Voice of Freedom," inciting the overthrow of the people's regime in the People's Democracies and the Soviet Union.

One can also cite the "American Friends of Free Russia." The center of this organization is in New York, with branches in Munich, Hanover, Kaiserslautern, etc. in West Germany. This "society" uses charitable activities as a cover to train spies and terrorists and send them to the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. The honorary chairman of this organization is US Navy Admiral and former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Standley.

A spy and sabotage organization is carrying out despicable activities, funded by the US intelligence agency "National Labor Alliance." The personnel of the "National Labor Alliance" were formerly agents of the Hitler secret police, and later they all served the US intelligence agencies.

So-called Romanian National Committee, Polish National Democratic Committee, Bulgarian National Center, "Free Albania" Committee, Hungarian National Committee, etc. have been established in the United States to carry out subversive activities.

Among the members of the sabotage organizations established by the Americans are former loyal lackeys of the Hitler regime who have committed serious crimes and other traitors who have escaped the sanctions of their own people.

As for what these organizations actually do and what goals they pursue, it can be seen from the documents they publish. For example, the declaration of the so-called "American Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of the USSR" openly states: "We should launch active activities against the Soviet system." The leaders of this committee said in the declaration that they have a responsibility: "Not only in providing economic assistance, but also in cooperating with the liberation movement in providing technical means and personnel, etc., firmly believing that the primary responsibility of free people everywhere is to fight for the overthrow of the Soviet system." This subversive committee, led by US officials, promised in the declaration to provide "all the moral and material assistance it can" for the above sinister purposes.

Not long ago, a series of facts about the criminal activities of US sabotage agencies were also announced at a press conference held in Moscow on February 6. The materials from this press conference have been distributed to the representatives of the General Assembly.

The statements made by former US intelligence agents and other materials presented as evidence at the press conference confirmed that US state organs have established a huge organizational system in the United States and in the Federal Republic of Germany and other countries, training saboteurs to carry out subversive activities against the Soviet Union. For example, there are such saboteur training schools in Bad Wiessee, Munich, Frankfurt am Main, Kaufering, Bad Wörishofen, and Bad Homburg. Recruits in these schools learn demolition work, investigate military targets, recruit new spies and saboteurs, establish underground sabotage groups, carry out sabotage activities, and distribute leaflets inciting armed riots.

After the saboteurs have completed their training in the "training classes," they take weapons, radio transmitters, false documents, poisons, and other sabotage equipment and infiltrate the Soviet border by US planes and other means.

Many of the terrorist saboteurs dispatched by US agencies have been detained in the German Democratic Republic and other countries in Europe.

Michael Irwin, an employee of the US intelligence agency—the US Counterintelligence Corps branch—detained by the authorities of the German Democratic Republic, said that this branch organizes a vast espionage and sabotage network within the territory of the German Democratic Republic. This group collects secret economic, political, and military intelligence, establishes secret weapons and ammunition depots, and organizes sabotage activities in enterprises in the German Democratic Republic.

This branch, led by US Army Captain William Arte, also sends US saboteurs into Poland and Czechoslovakia. In the past three years alone, ninety-two saboteurs attempting to infiltrate Poland and Czechoslovakia have been detained within the territory of the German Democratic Republic.

The memorandum from the government of the German Democratic Republic to the UN Secretary-General on January 21, 1957, regarding the US government's interference in the internal affairs of the German Democratic Republic, lists many examples proving how extensive the subversive activities taken by the United States against this peace-loving country are.

Hungary is a country where the United States has sent a particularly large number of saboteurs.

Since the establishment of the people's democratic system in Hungary, the Hungarian authorities have repeatedly exposed anti-people conspiracies and espionage and sabotage groups linked to US intelligence agencies and official US diplomatic representatives.

With the participation of the US agencies' lackeys in West Germany, the armed riots of fascist conspirators were prepared in Hungary. Far before October 23, 1956, special attention was paid to organizing and training armed counter-revolutionary groups in order to send them to Hungary at the appropriate time.

It is reported that under the leadership of the so-called "Hungarian Refugee Affairs Bureau," specialized schools and espionage training classes for training saboteurs have been established by US initiative and with US funds in Munich, Regensburg, Stuttgart, Kronberg, and Breisach as early as several years ago. In these schools, Horthy officers and former officers of the fascist German Wehrmacht train recruits in the use of weapons, while US intelligence agency personnel teach "special subjects" such as espionage and organizing sabotage activities, and so on.

There are many facts to prove that during the counter-revolutionary rebellion, there was organized dispatch of saboteurs to Hungary. For example, on November 21, 1956, a man named Zsigmond K. Kopta came to the Czechoslovak National Amnesty Repatriation Commission. He was returning from West Germany, where he had been working in a US intelligence agency.

Kopta said that on October 25, the leader of the intelligence agency at "Kollman Barracks," US Army Major Donaldson, called him and ordered him to prepare to send a group of people from Stuttgart to Hungary. These people were a group of Hungarian refugees. Accompanied by US Lieutenant Price, this group traveled by car from Stuttgart through Munich to the Austrian border. The car passed through the entire Austria without any obstruction and drove to the Hungarian border. Similarly, it crossed the border in the Nickelsdorf area without any obstruction. Upon his return, Lieutenant Price told Kopta that this group had gone to Győr, Hungary, to "do some work." The result of this "work" was the brutal massacre of hundreds of honest Hungarian patriots and the savage destruction and looting of people's wealth.

With the assistance of the sabotage organization led by former General Justus—the "Hungarian Warriors Alliance"—a saboteur "assault battalion" was established last October and sent to Hungary.

Of course, the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion was doomed to failure from the beginning. But everyone knows that the activities of the rebels and saboteurs brought much suffering and loss to the Hungarian people.

This is the actual face of the criminal and shameful "liberation" policy implemented by the US ruling bloc with many subversive organizations established with US taxpayers' money and guided by US state agencies.

The US "Radio Free Europe" Center is a Nest of Provocation and Sabotage

In the plans of the imperialists to plan a new war, slanderous propaganda that confuses the public occupies a special place. In order to deceive public opinion and incite hatred among the people of all countries, the United States has used a huge propaganda machine - newspapers, radio, movies, television, and so on. A large amount of slanderous rumors against socialist countries are released every day from the lair of the US propaganda agencies.

The "Radio Free Europe" Center played a very important role in the activities of carrying out subversive propaganda against peace-loving countries, and it is an auxiliary institution of the US espionage and sabotage agencies.

Although the US representative denied that US official agencies have ties with "Radio Free Europe," it is a universally known fact that "Radio Free Europe" is directly subordinate to the US state agencies.

To prove this, it is enough to quote the statement made by Congressman Smith on January 22, 1957. Smith admitted that since 1945, the US policy has been to incite the overthrow of the existing systems in the People's Democracies. Smith said: "We have done this through political platforms, through the 'Voice of America' and 'Radio Free Europe,' these are just a few roads."

The "Radio Free Europe" Center has a total of more than 1,200 staff members; the main members are fugitives from the People's Democracies.

During the period of the fascist riots in Hungary, the "Radio Free Europe" Center was a military-political headquarters, where direct instructions were issued to the secret activities of the counter-revolution.

For example, when the Hungarian government issued a cease-fire notice, "Radio Free Europe" immediately instructed the rebels not to cease fire. Military expert Colonel Bell, in his broadcast to Hungary on October 29, called on the rebels not to cease fire and to continue attacking the government.

This colonel gave even harsher orders to the fascist bandits in his broadcast on October 31.

He said: "All leaders of the current Hungarian armed forces must be removed from their leading positions. Soldiers! Immediately seize the positions of Minister of Defense and Chief of Staff"!

On the same day, "Radio Free Europe" issued orders to the rebels again. The radio broadcast said: "The Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Defense are still in their hands! Soldiers, do not cool down until the positions of the Minister of Internal Affairs and the Minister of Defense are in your hands! Do not hang up your guns! Do not give the Budapest government a piece of coal, a drop of oil"!

In those days, this "radio center" also dispatched many armed saboteurs from Munich to Hungary. They attempted to intimidate Hungarian peace residents with atrocities and terror and force them to submit to the counter-revolutionary regime.

In addition, this radio center also established several mobile radio stations in West Germany, whose task was to issue "appeals for help" to Western countries and the United Nations in the name of the rioters and spread rumors about the situation in Hungary.

The activities of "Radio Free Europe" that violate the norms of international law are so dangerous that sensible people in the Federal Republic of Germany have begun to feel uneasy. As a result, the government of this republic has had to take certain steps to regulate and inspect its activities, although this is only a show.

US Encroachment on the Airspace of Socialist Countries

In recent years, the United States has frequently encroached on the airspace of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, thereby grossly violating the sovereignty of these countries.

From 1953 to 1956, US civil and military aircraft intruded into Soviet airspace 113 times. During the same period, they intruded into the airspace of European People's Democracies 211 times.

During this period, Soviet aircraft never once intruded into US airspace.

Since 1955, US military agencies have begun to release large balloons into the airspace of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. These balloons are equipped with special instruments or carry provocative leaflets inciting terror, riots, and slowdowns in socialist countries, and sometimes they carry explosives for sabotage and arson.

The above-mentioned balloons are 15 meters in diameter and 1,600 cubic meters in volume. Each balloon hangs objects weighing up to 650 kilograms. The instruments carried by the balloons include automatic cameras for aerial topographic photography, radio transceivers, etc. Investigations of these balloons have proved that both the balloons themselves and the instruments on the balloons are made in the United States.

The materials in the possession of the Soviet government prove that these balloons were released by US military agencies from the territory of West Germany and from US air bases in certain countries bordering the Soviet Union.

According to statistics, from May 1954 to December 1956 alone, 420,000 balloons carrying hundreds of millions of leaflets were released. These balloons, when they fall to the ground or collide with aircraft, cause a series of flight accidents, explosions, and fires, and can also cause deaths and injuries.

This action seriously violates the universally recognized principles of international law prohibiting the violation of the airspace of sovereign states. This action directly violates the provisions of the Chicago International Agreement signed in 1944, which, by the way, the United States also ratified.

Article 8 of this convention stipulates: "Unmanned aircraft capable of flight shall not fly without pilots in the airspace of a contracting State without the special permission of that State or without complying with the conditions prescribed by the permission."

Now everyone sees that US state agencies use various methods to carry out peace threatening sabotage activities against socialist countries. The Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria , Romania , Albania ,and German Democratic Republic have lodged formal protests against above subversive activities.

However, the US government not only does not take measures to stop interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, but also further expands subversive activities, which cannot but make international relations tense.

Just imagine what the world would become and what kind of international relations would arise if other countries followed the example of the US government and wanted to overthrow the political systems of other countries or governments they were dissatisfied with. Thinking about this is enough to realize the full danger of the current US policy.

In order to defend peace, demand that the United States immediately stop subversive activities.

The facts listed above convincingly prove that US subversive activities have intensified recently.

The reason why the Soviet delegation raised this issue to the United Nations is not because the socialist countries, which have become the primary targets of US subversive activities, are unable to resist such activities. The reason why we submitted this issue to the United Nations for discussion is because US interference in the internal affairs of other countries is incompatible with the desire of the people of all countries to live peacefully on the basis of good neighborliness and mutual respect.

Concern for the fate of the world and a sense of responsibility prompted the Soviet government to submit this issue to the United Nations for discussion.

In contrast to the United States, which stubbornly pursues a "brink of war" policy, the Soviet Union and all other socialist countries have always advocated and now advocate developing normal friendly relations with all countries on a mutual basis.

The Soviet Union and the People's Democracies have in the past and now implemented a policy of peaceful coexistence towards the United States, as they do towards other countries. This policy is based on a realistic assessment of the international situation and is in line with the interests of the people of all countries.

Everyone understands how important the establishment of normal relations between the United States and socialist countries is to defending and strengthening peace.

Experience shows that cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union for peace and universal security is entirely possible. The people of the Soviet Union and the United States were once comrades-in-arms in the struggle against the common enemy—German fascism—during World War II.

Since the Soviet Union and the United States were able to cooperate in the difficult period of armed struggle against Hitler's rule for the benefit of all mankind, then in peacetime, they may and should not only maintain normal mutual relations, but also work together in the struggle to maintain and consolidate universal peace.

It was precisely in order to strengthen international cooperation that the Soviet government proposed the conclusion of a Soviet-US Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation in 1956. The Soviet Union very much hopes to develop economic, cultural and other ties between the people of the two countries on a mutual basis, especially to allow representatives of all strata of residents to visit the Soviet Union and the United States.

It is regrettable that the above-mentioned peaceful initiative of the Soviet Union has not received the support of the US government.

It should be pointed out that long before the UN Charter reaffirmed the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, this important principle of international law had become the basis of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union when the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1933.

According to a famous US-Soviet agreement signed by the Soviet Foreign Commissar and the US President in 1933, the governments of the two countries should avoid interfering in each other's internal affairs, "not establish, not fund, not support military organizations and groups for the purpose of armed struggle" against each other's countries, and "prevent any recruitment for this type of organization and group." Both sides should also prevent the establishment of organizations and groups of this type aimed at sabotaging the political or social systems of the two countries.

The Soviet Union has consistently fulfilled these tasks. However, the US government has unreasonably trampled on these obligations under the 1933 Soviet-US agreement and the UN Charter.

Assisting in ensuring the peace and security of the people of all countries is the obligation of the United Nations. Therefore, the United Nations must demand that those who violate the UN Charter and international law and threaten universal peace abide by the rules.

The United Nations' responsibility is to condemn US subversive activities against other countries and call on the US government to strictly establish its relations with all countries in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter.

A comprehensive discussion and correct resolution of this important issue will undoubtedly help to ease international tensions, establish normal good-neighborly relations between UN member states, and consolidate world peace.

    库兹?佐夫2月25日在联合国特别政委会上发言
    彻底揭露美国对社会主义国家的颠复活动
    据新华社讯  塔斯社纽约25日电：苏联出席联合国大会代表团团长库兹?佐夫1957年2月25日在联合国大会第十一届会议的特别政治委员会上的发言。摘要如下：
    苏联代表团提交联合国大会讨论关于美国干涉人民民主国家内政和美国对这些国家进行敌对的颠复活动的问题。
    苏联作为联合国的会员国，认为自己有义务提请联合国一切会员国注意上述问题，因为美国对其他国家内政的干涉日益加剧，会导致国际关系恶化，使得国际局势趋于复杂，而且对于普遍和平和各国人民的安全包含着十分危险的后果。
    苏联把这个问题提交大会讨论的出发点是：希望消除国际关系中的那种妨碍国际正常合作的情况，从而有助于改善国际关系和缓和国际紧张局势。
    对其他国家内政的干涉是美国当前政策的组成部分
    美国政府依靠它的直接代理人和形形色色的反人民的破坏组织对其他国家的内政进行危害和平的干涉，这绝不是偶然的现象，这种干涉是美国目前的侵略性外交政策方针的组成部分。
    美国帝国主义集团不愿考虑实际情况，也不愿考虑爱好和平的社会主义国家的存在，而在策划复辟这些国家的资本主义制度。
    美国反动集团想通过在人民民主国家中组织破坏活动和剥削阶级的残余分子的反革命活动的办法来阻挠年青的社会主义国家的发展和巩固，阻碍社会主义国家人民的生活水平的提高，并且力图在欧洲和全世界保持紧张气氛和加强新的世界大战的威胁。
    同社会主义国家势不两立的政策反映为：根据美国的倡议建立军事集团和联盟——北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织、美澳新集团以及由美国居领导地位的其他类似的侵略性排他集团。这种政策还表现为，美国在其他国家的领土上建立许多威胁普遍安全的军事基地，加强扩充军备和反对旨在裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的任何实际建议。
    所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”就是这种粗暴干涉其他国家内政的政策的最近的表现之一，美国政府企图通过“艾森豪威尔主义”在中近东国家建立美国的殖民统治，阻挠亚非国家同苏联和人民民主国家发展平等互利的经济和文化合作。
    在经济联系方面，对其他国家，首先是对社会主义国家展开破坏活动的方针，表现为美国强迫军事集团的伙伴们在它们对社会主义国家的贸易中采取歧视措施。实际情况表明，这种阻挠国际贸易和经济联系发展的作法首先使西方国家自身遭到损失，而且这种作法还妨碍着局势的正常化，这在和平条件下是一种不友好的行动。
    美国领导集团同时大规模展开诽谤宣传，煽动对爱好和平的社会主义各国人民的敌对和仇视。他们力图在自由的社会主义各国人民和其他国家人民之间建立严密的壁垒，阻碍他们之间的文化联系。
    美国领导集团极端反对和拒绝目的在于改善美国同爱好和平各国的关系的任何建议，他们制定了对社会主义各国展开颠复活动的计划，并且力图实现这些计划。
    策动对社会主义各国的颠复活动被提到美国国家政策的地位
    已经公布的政府文件和在社会主义各国破获的美国间谍组织的大量证据表明，对苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、德意志民主共和国和阿尔巴尼亚进行的颠复活动，是由美国官方人士策动和指导的，他们把这种活动看成自己对外政策的组成部分。
    大家知道，美国国会公开拨出经费，供对其他国家从事破坏活动之用，这在具有正常外交关系的国家关系上是史无前例的。
    美国国会按照1951年的所谓“共同安全”法，每年拨出一亿美元，供对苏联和人民民主国家从事颠复活动之用。过去几年中，美国政府按照这项法律为上述目的拨出了好几亿美元。1956年，这项年度费用增加到一亿二千五百万美元。
    这些拨款自然只是美国国家机关实际耗在对爱好和平各国进行“秘密战争”的经费中的一小部分。美国报刊指出，美国每年在各方面用于上述目的的支出共有几十亿美元。
    可以完全有理由把上述法律叫做颠复法，因为这项法律直言不讳地说，拨出的经费应当用于资助“住在苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚……的任何被选出的人或从这些国家逃出的人，或者用来把他们组织成支持北大西洋公约组织的武装部队，或者用于其他目的。”
    从美国许多政治家的言论中可以找到美国政府拨款的罪恶目的的更详细的说明。
    柯斯坦先生是这个法案中已经实行的部分的制定者。他在众议院发言的时候，确定美国对劳动人民掌权的国家的政策如下：
   “不久前总统同意和签署的共同安全法，规定了美国援助共产主义国家的地下解放运动的方法。这些原则都包括在我在众议院提出的修正案里面了，这个修正案已经被通过……”柯斯坦说：“我对共同安全法提出的修正案中规定，要援助那些现有的或者将来要成立的地下组织。这些地下组织可以得到领导，这样，他们的活动就不会是徒劳的。”
    柯斯坦着重指出，“说恐怖手段对东欧的解放运动不会起任何作用，那是不熟悉解放运动的性质……”柯斯坦又说，美国这种政策的目的是“散播恐惧”。
    柯斯坦认为，“仅仅用宣传和议会的手段不能达到解放的目的，它需要在适当的时候采取暴力的行动”。
    由此可见，按照美国这个计划，东欧各国应当在美国积极参与下被用暴力从人民民主制度下“解放”，例如可以借助于恐怖和破坏行动。
    参议员麦卡伦在向参议院解释这一类行动的用意时说，美国“的宣传只有追求一个明确而大胆的目的，即用我们所能用的一切手段去颠复苏维埃独裁，才能言行一致地产生结果……”麦卡伦公开要求“最大限度地支持共产党控制地区的破坏暴动团体”。在这方面，他建议美国政府为了伪装而利用一切组织和团体；他说，“没有理由使我们自己的进攻只限于政府行动。政府在和平时期不能公开做出私人团体所可能做的一切……”“在傀儡地区挑起暴动是可能的。”
    大家知道，联合国大会在1951年和1952年的第六届和第七届会议上已经讨论过颠复活动的问题。当时就有一些联合国会员国注意到美国1951年的这项法案的侵略性质，建议要求美国停止对其他国家内政的干涉。
    可是美国统治集团不顾世界舆论的呼声，对人民民主国家展开更加猖狂的破坏活动。他们通过了以加紧干涉其他国家的内政、对人民民主国家进一步展开敌对活动为目的的新法案。
    1955年，美国拟订了一个破坏活动的详细计划——“对世界共产主义展开政治进攻的计划”。这个计划明文规定要组织、支持并且供应人民民主国家的武装反革命匪徒。这样做的目的是利用这些由各种罪犯及卖国贼组成的武装匪徒来组织叛国暴乱。
    这个计划的制定者、美国一家最大的公司——“美国无线电公司”董事会董事长戴维·萨诺夫在他的备忘录中就这个问题公然无耻地写道：“希望能最大限度地运用这一支人力……应该把他们吸引到某种组织严密、资金充裕的反共组织中来……应该建立正式的流亡军官团，每一组的人数可以从十个人到一百个人，但必须作好准备，在非常条件下随时可以利用。”计划规定在人民民主国家组织广泛的地下活动，以煽动这些国家的公民背叛祖国。
    大家知道，这个对人民民主国家和苏联进行颠复活动的详细计划曾经美国高级政府人士讨论，并且得到他们的完全赞同。这个计划还在美国国会的官方文件集——“国会议事录”中刊印过。
    美国政府领导人在1951年以后在他们的言论中，仍然继续公开支持对社会主义国家人民自己选出来的合法政府进行颠复活动，继续号召使这些国家人民所摒弃的资本主义制度复辟。
    1952年，杜勒斯先生制定了他的所谓“解放”社会主义国家的政策。杜勒斯先生认为，美国的这种政策的目的应当是在人民民主国家复活资本主义。那时杜勒斯说：“要在各地妥善进行以促进解放为目的的工作。当然，这种活动是不能公开的。”
    当时杜勒斯先生还不是国务卿。后来，杜勒斯先生担负这个很高的官职以后，果然偿了宿愿，他不止一次地宣布把这种颠复活动作为美国政府的政策。
    国务卿杜勒斯先生1953年1月15日在参议院外交委员会演说的时候，建议从“约束俄国”的侵略政策转向更加积极的所谓解放政策，因为他认为前者还嫌不够。他1954年4月5日在众议院外交委员会演说的时候向国会议员保证说，只要在人民民主国家保持着现在的局面，美国政府就决不放弃这种颠复政策。杜勒斯先生揭示了“解放”政策的用意，他说：只要在这些国家存在着社会主义制度，“美国就不可能有真正的和平”。
    国务卿在去年1月9日对那些被人民民主国家赶出去的反动头子讲话的时候，又谈他所喜爱的这个主题，他重申美国“要致力于解放共产主义国家，决不作任何妥协”。
    以后，在美国总统和国务卿对东欧各国发表的所谓圣诞节祝词中也可以看到这种颠复政策的继续。顺便说一句，通过“自由欧洲”电台所散布的这些祝词的直接意图是煽动波兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利和其他人民民主国家的人民推翻这些国家的现政府，改变社会制度，在这些国家恢复美国统治集团所喜爱的秩序。
    1955年12月30日白宫的一个特别声明曾经指出，所谓“解放”人民民主国家人民，“在没有获得成功前，永远是美国外交政策的主要目标之一”。
    当美国统治集团鼓动所谓解放社会主义国家人民的时候，他们指的是什么呢？
    谁都知道，在社会主义国家存在着生产资料公有制。这些国家的土地、矿藏和工厂都是全体劳动人民的财产。国民经济飞速发展，人民的物质福利不断增长。在这些国家里，全部政权都操在劳动人民手中，他们享有真正的自由——摆脱了剥削的自由。
    所谓“解放”政策的策划者所希望的正是推翻人民民主国家的劳动人民所亲自选择、并且符合他们的根本利益的人民民主制度。他们幻想在社会主义国家中恢复地主和资本家的政权，重新把这些国家的人民变成残酷剥削的对象。
    美国是对社会主义国家进行颠复活动的组织者
    美国某些国家领导人伪善地声明，所通过的关于拨款组织破坏活动的法案、煽动暴动反对这些国家人民所选定的政府的活动本身并不是颠复活动和干涉这些国家内政的证据。
    但是事实表明，美国政府粗暴地践踏了国际法，一贯坚持依据所通过的法案和国家领导人的声明进行颠复活动，反对其他爱好和平的国家，并且把这种活动提高到国家的官方政策的水平。
    美国官方人士广泛展开工作培养在人民民主国家进行颠复活动的骨干。无论是在美国国内还是在若干西欧国家中，都由美国创议和用美国资金建立了和继续在建立许多间谍破坏组织以达到上述目的。这些组织在美国设有总部，并且同美国有关的政府机关有着密切的联系。这些机关供给它们经费并且给它们指示。
    对别国进行颠复活动的美国政府机关之一就是以艾伦·杜勒斯先生为首的中央情报局。这个机关首先参与派遣破坏者到别国领土上、供给秘密匪帮的武器和准备反政府武装暴动的活动。这一点，在最近的匈牙利事件中特别明显地得到了证实。
    在美国中央情报局为了破坏和颠复欧洲自由国家的政府而组织的机构中，起重要作用的是“自由欧洲委员会”、“争取自由十字军”这些组织。著名官员和工业金融寡头艾伦·杜勒斯、克莱将军和亿万富翁洛克菲勒等人是“争取自由十字军”组织的创立者和领导者。
   “自由洲欧委员会”是在“冷战”紧张时成立的，它和“争取自由十字军”的活动有密切联系。
    这些组织是谍报机关用来资助形形色色的侨民、间谍和恐怖团体并指导他们活动的中心之一。
    为了领导对苏联进行颠复活动的组织和破坏团体的活动，在1951年成立了“争取苏联民族自由美国委员会”，总部设在纽约。这个组织的领导者中比较有名的是：前美国驻苏联大使阿兰·寇克先生，前国务院和参谋长联席会议的著名工作人员霍·塞经特等人。
    今年2月间又在华盛顿组织了一个颠复团体“公民对外关系问题委员会”，这个组织的领导者是魏德迈将军、乌利乌斯·阿莫斯上校、詹姆斯·克隆威尔、查尔斯·埃迪逊等人。美国报刊报道说，这个委员会的任务是积极推动人民民主国家中的颠复活动。
    美国报刊说，为了达到颠复目的，在美国甚至成立了“别动队”。这是由一些小队组成的。第七十七小队驻在布拉哥堡，第十特遣队已被派到德意志联邦共和国的领土上。偶然来到美国布拉哥堡的参观者在看到用波兰文，捷克文、俄文、德文和其他国的语文发号施令的下级军官的时候是会感到十分惊异的。
    这些军队都在受专门训练：训练他们组成不超过十五人的小组进行独立活动的本领，以及潜入外国领土组织破坏和怠工的方法。
    从不久前发生的由外部煽动和挑起的匈牙利事件就可以判断出，这些“特别小组”的任务是什么。这些小组在匈牙利的使命是进行破坏工农政权机关和谋害某些公民的罪恶恐怖行动。
    美国拨出了大笔款项，作为组织和维持西欧国家中对社会主义国家进行颠复活动的许多小组的经费。
    德意志联邦共和国为这些小组进行卑鄙活动提供了许多特别方便的条件。例如，在慕尼黑有一个“美国解放委员会”。这个委员会散发“我们的共同事业”、“自由之声”等传单，煽动推翻人民民主国家和苏联的人民政权。
    还可以举出“自由俄国美国之友社”。这个组织的中心设在纽约，分部设在西德的慕尼黑、汉诺威、凯撤劳敦等地。这个“社”以慈善活动为招牌，培养间谍和恐怖分子，派他们到苏联和人民民主国家去。这个组织的名誉主席是美国海军上将、前美国驻苏联大使斯坦德莱。
    由美国间谍机关“全国劳动联盟”供给经费成立了一个间谍破坏组织，这个组织正在进行卑鄙的活动。“全国劳动联盟”的人员过去都是希特勒秘密警察的代理人，以后他们又都为美国的谍报机关服务了。
    在美国成立了所谓罗马尼亚民族委员会、波兰民族民主委员会、保加利亚民族中心、“自由阿尔巴尼亚”委员会、匈牙利民族委员会等等，来进行颠复活动。
    在美国人建立的破坏组织的成员中，有犯过严重罪行的前希特勒政权的忠实走狗和其他一些逃避了本国人民制裁的叛徒。
    至于说，这些组织究竟进行些什么活动，它们追求什么目的，可以从它们公布的文件中看出来。例如，在所谓“争取苏联民族自由美国委员会”的宣言中就公开说到：“我们应该展开反对苏维埃制度的积极活动。”这个委员会的领导人在宣言中说，他们有责任：“不仅仅是在提供经济援助方面，而且要在提供技术手段和人员等等方面同解放运动合作，坚决相信，为推翻苏维埃制度而斗争，是各地自由人民的首要职责。”这个由美国官方人物领导的颠复委员会在宣言中答应为上述罪恶目的提供“它力所能及的一切道义的和物质的援助”。
    前不久，在2月6日莫斯科举行的记者招待会上，还公布了美国破坏机构的一系列罪恶活动的事实。这个记者招待会上的材料已经散发给大会的代表们了。
    前美国谍报机关的间谍所作的声明和其他一些在记者招待会上作为物证展出的材料，证实了美国国家机关在美国以及在德意志联邦共和国和其他一些国家中设立了庞大的机构系统，训练破坏分子对苏联进行颠复活动。例如，在巴特维塞，慕尼黑，美因河畔的法兰克福，考弗贝伦，巴特沃里斯霍芬以及巴特荷姆堡都有这样的破坏分子训练学校。招募来的人在这种学校中学习爆破工作，调查军事目标，招募新的间谍和破坏分子，建立地下破坏小组，进行破坏活动，散发煽动武装暴动的传单。
    破坏者在“训练班”受完训之后，便带着武器、无线电发报机、假证件、毒药和其他破坏用的装备乘坐美国飞机和用其他方法潜入苏联国境。
    美国机关派遣的破坏恐怖分子有不少已在德意志民主共和国和欧洲的其他国家被扣押了。
    为德意志民主共和国当局扣押的美国谍报机关——美国反间谍队分部的一个工作人员迈克·伊文说，这个分部在民主德国境内组织广大的间谍破坏网。这个集团收集秘密的经济、政治、军事情报，建立秘密武器弹药库，在民主德国的企业内组织破坏活动。
    这个由美军上尉威廉·阿耳特所领导的分部还派遣美国的破坏者进入波兰和捷克斯洛伐克境内。仅仅在最近三年内，在民主德国境内就扣押了九十二个企图潜入波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的破坏者。
    德意志民主共和国政府1957年1月21日给联合国秘书长的关于美国政府干涉德意志民主共和国内政的备忘录中列举了许多事例，证明美国对这个爱好和平的国家所采取的颠复活动的范围多么广泛。
    匈牙利是美国派入破坏分子特别多的一个国家。
    自从匈牙利建立人民民主制度以来，匈牙利当局就曾不止一次地揭露同美国间谍机关和美国官方外交代表有联系的反人民的阴谋集团和间谍破坏集团。
    美国机关在西德的走狗的参与下，在匈牙利准备发动法西斯阴谋者的武装暴乱。远在1956年10月23日以前，就特别重视组织和训练武装反革命集团，以便在适当的时机把它们派到匈牙利去。
    据悉，在所谓“匈牙利难民事务局”的领导下，早在几年以前就由美国倡议和用美国经费在慕尼黑，累根斯堡，斯图加特，克隆贝格，布赖扎赫设立了训练破坏分子的专门学校和间谍训练班。在这些学校里，由霍尔蒂军官以及前法西斯德国国防军军官训练招募来的人使用武器，而美国谍报机关的工作人员则教授“特种科目”，如间谍活动和组织破坏活动等等。
    有许多事实可以证明，就在反革命叛乱期间，曾经有人组织和派遣破坏分子到匈牙利去。例如，在1956年11月21日，有一个名叫兹吉?克·科普塔的人来到了捷克斯洛伐克人大赦归国协进委员会，他是从西德回去的，本来在西德的一个美国谍报机关中工作。
    科普塔说，10月25日那天，“考尔曼兵营”的谍报机关领导人美军少校唐纳逊把他叫去，命令他准备把一批人从斯图加特送到匈牙利去。这些人是一群匈牙利逃亡者。这一群人在美国中尉普赖斯的伴送下乘汽车从斯图加特经过慕尼黑到奥地利边境。汽车毫无阻挡地穿过整个奥地利一直开到匈牙利边境，同样，毫无阻挡地在尼克尔斯多夫地区越过了边境。回来的时候，普赖斯中尉对科普塔说，这一群人到匈牙利吉厄尔城“进行工作去了”。这种“工作”的成绩就是数以百计的正直的匈牙利爱国者受到残杀，人民的财富遭到野蛮的毁坏和抢劫。
    在前将军尤斯提领导的破坏组织——“匈牙利战士联盟”的协助下，去年10月曾经建立了一个破坏分子的“突击营”，并且派到匈牙利去了。
    当然，匈牙利的反革命叛乱是一开始便注定要失败的。但是大家知道，叛乱分子和破坏分子的活动给匈牙利人民带来了许多苦难和损失。
    美国统治集团用由美国纳税人的钱建立的和由美国国家机构指导的许多颠复组织来执行的罪恶而可耻的“解放”政策，其实际面貌就是这样。
    美国的“自由欧洲”无线电中心是挑拨和破坏的巢穴
    在帝国主义策划新战争的计划中，混淆人民群众视听的造谣的诽谤宣传占有特别的地位。为了欺骗社会舆论，煽动各国人民之间的仇恨，美国动用了庞大的宣传机器——报刊、无线电、电影、电视等等。美国宣传机构的老巢里每天放出大量的诽谤社会主义国家的谰言。
   “自由欧洲”无线电中心在对爱好和平的国家进行颠复宣传的活动中，起了很重要的作用，它是美国间谍破坏机构的一个辅助机构。
    虽然美国代表否认美国官方机关同“自由欧洲”电台有联系，但是，“自由欧洲”电台直接从属于美国的国家机关，这是举世皆知的事实。
    要想证明这一点，只要引用一下众议院议员史密斯1957年1月22日所发表的声明就足够了。史密斯承认，从1945年开始，美国的政策就是煽动推翻人民民主国家现有的制度。史密斯说：“我们已经通过政治讲台，通过‘美国之音’和‘自由欧洲’电台这样做了，这里说的只是几条不多的道路”。
    “自由欧洲”无线电中心一共有一千二百多名工作人员；其中主要成员是人民民主国家的逃犯。
    在匈牙利发生法西斯暴乱的时期，“自由欧洲”无线电中心是一个军事政治大本营，这里向反革命的秘密活动发出了直接指示。
    例如，当匈牙利政府发出停火通告的时候，“自由欧洲”电台就立刻指使叛乱分子不要停火。军事专家贝尔上校在10月29日对匈广播中，要叛乱分子不要停火和继续攻击政府。
    这位上校在10月31日的广播中向法西斯匪徒下了更加严厉的命令。
    他说：“必须把目前匈牙利武装部队的所有领袖都赶下领导岗位。战士们！马上夺取国防部长的职位以及总司令和总参谋长的职位”！
    在同一天，“自由欧洲”电台又向叛乱分子播发了命令。这个电台广播说：“内务部和国防部依然还在他们手中！战士们，在内务部长和国防部长的职位还没有到手以前，你们不要冷下来！不要把枪挂起来！不要给布达佩斯政府一块煤，一滴石油”！
    这个“无线电中心”在那些日子里还从慕尼黑派遣了不少武装破坏分子到匈牙利去，他们企图用兽行和恐怖来恫吓匈牙利和平居民，使他们屈从反革命政权。
    此外，这个无线电中心还在西德建立了好几个流动电台，这些电台的任务是以暴动者的名义向西方国家和联合国发出“求援呼吁”和对匈牙利的情况散布谣言。
   “自由欧洲”无线电中心这种违反国际法准则的活动具有巨大的危险性，以致德意志联邦共和国头脑清醒的人们都开始感到不安，结果，这个共和国的政府不得不采取某些步骤，规定检查它的活动，虽然这只不过是做做样子而已。
    美国侵犯社会主义国家的领空
    最近几年以来，美国经常侵犯苏联和人民民主国家的领空，从而粗暴地侵犯了这些国家的主权。
    从1953年到1956年，美国民用和军用飞机侵入苏联领空达一百一十三次，在同一时期，侵入欧洲人民民主国家的领空达二百一十一次。
    在这个期间内，苏联的飞机没有一次侵入过美国的领空。
    从1955年起，美国军事机关开始往苏联和人民民主国家的领空内放大型气球，在这些气球里装置着特别的仪器，或者带有煽动在社会主义国家进行恐怖、叛乱、怠工的挑拨传单，有时还带有破坏和放火用的爆炸物。
    上述气球的直径达十五公尺，体积达一千六百立方公尺。每个气球上悬挂的东西重达六百五十公斤。气球携带的仪器中有空中摄影地形用的自动摄影机、无线电收发报机等。对这些气球的调查结果证明，不论是气球本身，或是气球上的仪器都是美国制造的。
    苏联政府掌握的材料证明，这些气球都是美国军事机关从西德的领土、从某些同苏联接壤的国家中的美国空军基地上放出来的。
    据统计，仅从1954年5月到1956年12月，就放出了带有成亿张传单的四十二万个气球。这些气球在坠到地上、或者同飞机相撞的时候，成为一系列的飞行事故、爆炸和火灾的起因，还会造成死伤。
    这种行动十分严重地破坏了公认的禁止侵犯主权国家领空的国际法原则。这种行动直接违反了1944年签订的芝加哥国际协定的条款，顺便说一句，美国也是批准了这个协定的。
    这个公约的第八条规定：“凡不用驾驶员而可以飞行的空中飞行工具，在没有某一缔约国的特别许可或者不遵守许可所规定的条件下，不得没有驾驶员而在该缔约国的领空上飞行”。
    现在大家看到，美国的国家机构利用各种各样的方法对社会主义国家进行危害和平的破坏活动。苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚和德意志民主共和国对上述的颠复活动提出了正式的抗议。
    但是，美国政府不但不采取措施停止干涉其他国家内政，而且更加扩大颠复活动，这样就不能不使国际关系紧张起来。
    试想，如果其他国家也学美国政府的样子，也想推翻别国的政治制度或者是它们所不满意的政府，那么世界将会变成个什么样子，而又会出现怎么样的国际关系，这样一想，就足以意识到美国现行政策的全部危险性了。
    为了保卫和平，要求美国立即停止颠复活动。
    以上例举的事实令人信服地证明，美国的颠复活动在最近加紧了。
    苏联代表团所以向联合国提出这个问题，决不是因为成为美国的颠复活动的首要目标的社会主义国家没有能力反击这种活动。我们之所以将这个问题提交联合国讨论，是因为美国对其他国家内务的干涉，与各国人民在睦邻和互相尊重的基础上和平生活的愿望是势不两立的。
    对世界命运的关怀和责任感促使苏联政府将这个问题提交联合国讨论。
    同顽固地奉行“战争边缘”政策的美国相反，苏联和其他所有社会主义国家，过去和现在都主张在相互的基础上，同所有国家发展正常的友好关系。
    苏联和人民民主国家过去和现在对美国，也像对其他国家一样，执行和平共处的政策。这种政策是根据对国际局势的现实估计出发的，而且符合各国人民的利益。
    每个人都了解，美国和社会主义国家建立正常的关系对保卫和加强和平有多么重大的意义。
    经验表明，美国和苏联为和平和普遍安全而合作是完全可能的。苏联和美国的人民在第二次世界大战时期曾经是反对共同敌人——德国法西斯主义的斗争中的战友。
    苏联和美国既然能够在同希特勒统治作武装斗争的艰苦时期为全人类利益合作，那么在和平时期，它们可能而且应当不仅保持正常的相互关系，而且协同努力，从事维护和巩固普遍和平的斗争。
    正是为了加强国际合作，苏联政府在1956年提出了缔结苏美友好合作条约的建议。苏联非常希望在相互基础上发展两国人民之间的经济、文化和其他联系，特别是要让各阶层居民的代表人物对苏联和美国的互相访问。
    令人遗憾的是，苏联的上述和平倡议没有得到美国政府方面的支持。
    应当指出，早在联合国宪章重申不容许干涉他国内政的原则以前，这一重要的国际法原则在1933年美苏两国建立外交关系的时候就已经成为两国外交关系的基础了。
    按照苏联外交人民委员和美国总统在1933年签订的一项著名的美苏协定，两国政府应该避免互相干涉内政，“不建立、不拨款补助、不支持以武装斗争为目的的军事组织和集团”来反对对方国家，并且“防止为这一类组织和集团进行任何招募。”双方还应该防止这一类以破坏两国政治或社会制度的斗争为目的的组织和集团的建立。
    苏联一贯履行这些任务。可是美国政府却蛮不讲理地践踏这些根据1933年苏美协定和联合国宪章承担的义务。
    协助保障各国人民的和平和安全是联合国的义务，因此联合国必须要求那些违反联合国宪章和国际法、使普遍和平受到威胁的破坏者遵守规矩。
    联合国的职责是谴责美国对其他国家的颠复活动并且号召美国政府严格地根据联合国宪章的原则建立它同所有国家的关系。
    全面地讨论和正确地解决这个重要问题，毫无疑问，会有助于缓和国际紧张局势、建立联合国会员国之间正常的睦邻关系和巩固世界和平。
