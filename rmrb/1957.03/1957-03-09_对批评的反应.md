    Reactions to Criticism

    Letter from the Zhenjiang City Committee of the Communist Youth League: Regarding the criticism of us in the "Do Not Try to Squander Surplus Funds" article published on page 4 of the People's Daily on December 20th of last year, the facts are correct except that we did not intend to purchase bicycles. We are determined to establish a thrifty work style in our future work.

    Letter from the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau of the Xingtai Special Prefecture, Hebei: The "Ordered to Squander" article on page 4 of the People's Daily on December 26th of last year criticized our subordinate county's agricultural departments for rushing to spend money. We immediately took measures to stop this phenomenon. This criticism is basically true. Some of it needs explanation: The construction of the nursery station in Xingtai County and the purchase of radios and coffee tables in Nangong County were both due to work needs and were originally planned. Of these, only the purchase of the radio was approved; the other two items were not approved.

    对批评的反应
    青年团镇江市委员会来信：人民日报去年12月20日四版刊载的“不要设法挥霍结余经费”对我们的批评，除了我们没有打算要购买自行车以外，其他事实都是正确的。我们决心在今后的工作中树立俭朴作风。
    河北邢台专署农林局来信：人民日报去年12月26日四版的“奉命挥霍”，批评我们所属县的农业部门突击花钱，我们当即采取措施制止了这种现象。这个批评基本上是属实的。其中有的需要说明：邢台县苗圃站盖房，南宫县买收音机、茶几，都是因工作需要，原就有这样的计划。其中除买了收音机而外，其他两项，都没有被批准。
