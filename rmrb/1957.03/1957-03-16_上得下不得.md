    “Can Go Up, But Can't Go Down”
    Ma Qianzu
    The office is upstairs; if you want to work, you have to go upstairs. The dining hall is downstairs; if you want to eat, you have to go downstairs. People inevitably go up and down due to different tasks. However, some of our cadres are only allowed to "rise step by step" and not allowed to "descend" even occasionally. It's as if "position" doesn't shift with "task," but "task" must ascend or descend according to "position." It's like a lazy person eating, having to move the food from downstairs to upstairs: "Can go up, but can't go down."
    Among us, there is indeed such a customary law: a section chief who can handle general affairs or finance, if transferred to another business section for some reason, must still be a section chief, even if they are not familiar with the new business. And so on, even more so. I don't know what the "mystery" is here. But it is said that in capitalist countries, if Mr. A is president today, and not president tomorrow, he can still be a lawyer or something, and the custom doesn't find it strange. Although their presidents are merely puppets of monopoly capital, going up and down, in essence, all listening to the orders of "capital." But the fact that social customs don't find it strange is a good thing.
    I often think that the human soul is ultimately very complex. On the one hand, it has endured the tempering of revolution and the transformation of Marxism-Leninism, but on the other hand, habitual forces often hide in another corner of the soul, ready to show their "ugly faces." In 1949, when I was working in a certain ministry, the head of the ministry estimated the development of the situation and had to cultivate some cadres to prepare for the work that must be undertaken in the future, so more than sixty revolutionary cadres were transferred from the Northeast. But no one was willing to accept this "cultivation" task; they all wanted to go south, and the reasons were naturally all grand. But one person revealed a "heartfelt word," saying that the reason he didn't want to stay in the central government was because "in the central government, [you're] an insect; in the local area, a dragon." Look: this "maxim" of the old society, which he personally participated in overthrowing, popped out from the corner of this revolutionary cadre's soul.
    I have also heard such a story: a revolutionary cadre, working in a certain ministry, was given a "title" to increase his workload. After receiving this "title," he inquired with relevant parties about how many people within the ministry had such a "title." The answer was only two. So he smiled broadly and said, "That's good." The implication was that if there were many people, his own "excellence" would not be apparent. It seems that the old idea of "below one person, above ten thousand" popped out from his soul.
    How terrible! The influence of habitual forces on people's souls.
    To resist this habitual force, one must have strong courage. Habitual forces are good at spreading "whispering discussions." A cadre had served in a relatively important position in a certain state organ. But because his profession was not his strength, he requested a transfer. And the position he was transferred to was just an ordinary business, so there were many "whispering discussions": "Couldn't make it!" "Demoted!" "Made a mistake!" "Had no place to go, so had to come here!" Until the cadre himself felt "Maybe that's really the case!" So he couldn't help but worry and deeply felt that life between heaven and earth must be "rising step by step."
    I believe that overthrowing the old society's old system was difficult, but eliminating the old society's habitual forces is even more difficult. Therefore, the key to the problem lies in promoting the revolutionary tradition of "sharing joys and sorrows with the people." If one is only greedy for the merits of the revolution, thinking that the world was conquered by oneself, then habitual forces will eventually engulf him and alienate him from the revolution. At that time, he may become "can't go, brother," "can't go up, and can't go down."

马前卒

    “上得下不得”
    马前卒
    办公室在楼上，你要办公总得上楼。饭厅在楼下，你要吃饭总得下楼。所从事的任务不同，人是不免于上上下下的。可是，我们的有些干部，只许“步步高升”，不准偶有“下降”。仿佛“职位”不因“任务”而转移，而“任务”却须由“职位”而上下。正如懒汉吃饭，还得从楼下搬到楼上来：“上得下不得。”
    我们之间，的确也有这样的一条习惯法：能搞总务或财务的科长，因故调到其他业务科，即使他并不熟稔这项业务，却也非当个科长不可的。等而上之，更不用说了。此中“玄理”何在，我不得而知。但据说，资本主义国家，今天某甲当了总统，明天总统不当，还可以去当律师什么的，习俗也并不以为怪。虽然他们的总统，不过是垄断资本的傀儡，上上下下，实质上全听“资本”命令。但社会习俗不以为怪，却是好事情。
    我常想，人的灵魂终究是复杂得很的。一方面，承受了革命的锻炼，马克思列宁主义的改造，但另一方面，习惯势力却还常常隐蔽在灵魂的另一角落，随时会显出它的“鬼脸”。1949年我在某部做事，部的负责人估计形势发展，必须培养一些干部，为将来必须担负的工作作好准备，从东北调来六十多位革命干部。可是没有一个人愿意接受这个“培养”任务，都要南下，理由自然是无不堂皇的。但其中有一个人却透露了一句“心底话”，他之所以不愿在中央，是因为“中央一根虫，地方一根龙”。你瞧：被他所亲手参加推翻的旧社会的这句“格言”，却偏偏在这个革命干部的灵魂角落里钻出来了。
    我还听到过这样的故事：也是一个革命干部，在某部任事，为了加重他的工作任务，给他一个“头衔”。他得到这个“头衔”后，就向有关方面探询，一部之内，有这样“头衔”的有几人？回答是，仅有两人。于是他笑形于色道：“这样还好”。意思之间，如果有多人就显不出自己的“高妙”了。看来，还是“一人之下，万人之上”的旧思想从他的灵魂里钻出来了。
    可怕哉！习惯势力给予人们的灵魂的影响。
    要抵抗住这种习惯势力，是必须有坚强的勇气的。习惯势力善于散布“窃窃私议”。一个干部曾经在某国家机关担任过比较重要的职务。但因他所业非所长，请求调职了。而所调之职，不过是一种普通业务，于是“窃窃私议”颇多：“吃不开呀！”“降职了呀！”“犯了错误了呀！”“没有地方去只好到这儿来呀！”直至这干部自己也觉得“怕真的是这样的吧！”于是不免发愁，而深深地觉得：人生天地之间，是必须“步步高升”的。
    我以为，打倒旧社会的旧制度固然艰苦，但消灭旧社会的习惯势力实在更困难。所以，问题的关键在于发扬“与民共甘苦”的革命传统。如果一味贪革命之功，以为天下是老子打出来的，那么，习惯势力将终会吞没他而远离了革命。到那时候，怕会变做“行不得也哥哥”，“上不得下亦不得”了。
