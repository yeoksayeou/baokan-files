Appropriate Birth Control Should Be Practiced

In recent years, the broad masses of enterprise workers and staff in China have urgently requested the health administrative departments to help them practice birth control. Many farmers have also begun to make this request. The Party and the government support this demand of the people. As early as August 1953, the Government Administration Council had already instructed the Ministry of Health to help the masses with birth control and approved the revised measures for contraception and induced abortion by the Ministry of Health. After Comrade Liu Shaoqi convened a symposium on birth control issues on December 27, 1954, the Second Office of the State Council designated relevant department heads to organize a research group on birth control issues and proposed some methods for carrying out birth control work. At the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Party, in the report "Suggestions on the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy," once again stated that "appropriate birth control should be exercised." Although health administrative organs at all levels have taken some birth control measures in accordance with the instructions of the Party and the government, they are still constrained and therefore cannot meet the urgent and reasonable demands of the people.

China is the most populous country in the world. Among all things in the world, people are the most valuable. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, China's 600 million people have created many great miracles. Due to the fundamental change in the political status of the Chinese people and the great improvement in economic, cultural, and health conditions, the rate of population growth has also increased. The continuous growth of the population indicates the prosperity and flourishing of the nation, which is a good thing and not a bad thing.

However, China has suffered long-term exploitation and enslavement by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in the past, and its economy and culture are very backward. It will take decades to fundamentally change this backward state. This backward state inevitably limits the rapid improvement of people's lives and inevitably leaves us with many difficulties that are not easy to completely overcome in the short term. For parents with many children, these difficulties are often particularly significant. Since liberation, although workers' wages have gradually increased and the development speed of nurseries and schools is unparalleled to that before liberation, these are still not enough to meet the needs of workers with many children. Many workers who have become parents are seriously and adversely affected in their work, study, and health due to the heavy burden of life, and their family life and education of their children also encounter many difficulties and obstacles. For example, Zhang Xiaodi, a railway worker in Shanghai, earns more than 50 yuan a month, and life could have been manageable, but because he and his wife have six children, life is very difficult. At the end of the month when there is no money, the husband blames the wife for not being able to manage, and the wife also blames the husband for not knowing the difficulties, and they often quarrel, not getting along as well as before. Gu Dajie, a women's representative in Rongsheng Lane, Shanghai, gave birth to fourteen children and is now very weak, sweating even on snowy days. Many workers, because they have too many children, not only do not have time to educate their children, but often beat and scold them, and even if the children are sick, they cannot be treated in time. These phenomena exist everywhere. Therefore, ordinary parents urgently demand birth control for the sake of their own and their children's vital interests. Their demands are completely reasonable.

Farmers are now also beginning to demand birth control. Before liberation, farmers lived in extreme poverty, infanticide was very serious in rural areas, and infant mortality rates were also very high. In recent years, the lives of farmers have steadily improved, infanticide has been greatly reduced, and infant mortality rates have been greatly reduced, so the rate of population growth in rural areas has greatly accelerated. According to the estimation of survey materials from many typical areas: Since the government advocated and promoted new methods of childbirth, an average of about five million more babies nationwide are now escaping the threat of death each year than before liberation. This is certainly gratifying. However, because the rural population is growing too fast, affecting the improvement of farmers' lives, this also makes the masses of farmers, especially young farmers, feel the need for birth control. Yutian County, Hebei Province, held a contraception exhibition, which attracted more than 50,000 visitors in seven days. Some towns shipped some contraceptive drugs and books, which were quickly snapped up. This shows that the issue of contraception in rural areas also urgently needs to be resolved.

For several years, China's population has been growing at a rate of about 2.2% per year, exceeding that of any other country in the world. At the same time, China's industrial production has been growing at an average of about 10% per year, and agricultural production has been growing at an average of about 5% per year. This is a very high rate of economic development. It is precisely because China's industry and agriculture are growing faster than China's population that the living standards of the Chinese people can still be improved year by year. However, if the population grows more slowly, then the improvement of people's lives will be faster, which is a very obvious truth. In this situation, we advocate that throughout the country, except for ethnic minority areas with particularly sparse populations, appropriate birth control should be promoted. This is not only in line with the current interests of each family and individual, but also in line with the country's socialist construction and the long-term interests of the people. Our advocacy of appropriate birth control is fundamentally different from Malthusianism. The basic argument of Malthusianism is that the growth rate of the production of means of subsistence will never keep up with the growth rate of the population. China's actual life has proved the error of this assertion. However, pointing out the error of Malthusianism does not mean that there is any benefit or necessity to having children too early, too often, or too closely spaced.

So, how should birth control be practiced?

First, the habit of early marriage should be changed. The earlier the marriage, the more children are born, and the greater the difficulties caused to young couples. In order to control birth, it is necessary to advocate late marriage. In the past, there was a bad habit of early marriage in China, which caused a lot of pain to young men and women. In order to change this habit, the Marriage Law stipulates the minimum age for marriage. However, this provision does not mean that one must get married at the minimum age. In fact, it is beneficial and harmless to get married after the age of twenty-five. At present, many young people not only get married before the age of twenty-five, but even before the age of twenty, resulting in many difficulties in life. In many rural areas, there are even phenomena of marrying below the age stipulated by the Marriage Law. Therefore, it is necessary to work hard to carry out propaganda and education among the masses, break the bad habit of early marriage, and advocate getting married a little later.

Second, promote contraception methods. Under the condition that health is not impaired, various effective contraception methods should be promoted. Under the same conditions, parents with many children can also voluntarily undergo sterilization. The health department's past restrictions on these aspects were inappropriate and should be relaxed as much as possible in the future.

Birth control is a matter for the people themselves and also a matter for the state. We should actively publicize and advocate, generally explain the positive significance of birth control, generally and correctly disseminate common knowledge of male and female physiology, widely introduce simple and effective contraception methods, and fully supply cheap and reliable contraceptive tools. No coercion is allowed in these tasks. Of course, we must also fully estimate the many difficulties that may be encountered in promoting birth control work among the masses. However, those difficulties can be actively sought to overcome. As long as it is widely advocated and various specific measures are taken at the same time, this work will gradually achieve results.

### 应该适当地节制生育

    应该适当地节制生育
    近几年来，我国广大的企业职工和机关工作人员，迫切地要求卫生行政部门帮助他们节制生育。许多农民也开始提出了这个要求。党和政府是支持人民群众的这个要求的。早在1953年8月，政务院已经指示中央卫生部帮助群众节育，并且批准了中央卫生部修订的避孕及人工流产办法。刘少奇同志在1954年12月27日召开了关于节制生育问题的座谈会以后，国务院第二办公室指定有关部门负责人组织了节育问题的研究小组，提出了开展节育工作的一些办法。在中共第八次全国代表大会上，周恩来同志代表党中央委员会所作的“关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议”的报告中，又一次说明应该“在生育方面加以适当的节制”。各级卫生行政机关根据党和政府的指示，虽然已经采取了若干节育的措施，但是仍然束手束脚，因而还不能满足人民群众的这个迫切的合理的要求。
    我国是全世界人口最多的国家。在世界上的一切事物中，人是最宝贵的。在共产党领导下，我国六万万人民已经创造了许多伟大的奇迹。由于我国人民政治地位的根本改变，经济、文化、卫生等条件的大大改善，人口的增殖率也提高了。人口的不断增长表示着民族的繁荣和兴旺，这是好事而不是坏事。
    但是，我国过去长期遭受帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的剥削和奴役，经济和文化都很落后，要根本改变这种落后状态需要几十年时间。这种落后状态当然不能不限制人民生活的迅速改善，当然不能不留给我们许多一时不容易完全克服的困难。对于多子女的父母说来，这些困难往往特别显著。解放以来，职工的工资尽管逐渐地有所增加，托儿所和学校的发展速度更为解放前所不能比拟，可是，这些都还不能满足多子女的职工的需要。许多做了父母的职工，由于过重的生活负担，不仅自己的工作、学习和身体的健康受到严重的不利的影响，而且他们的家庭生活和对子女的教养也遇到了很多困难和妨害。例如，上海铁路工人张小弟每月收入五十多元，生活本来可以过得去，但是因为他们夫妇有了六个孩子，生活就很困难。到了月底没有钱，丈夫就怪妻子不会安排，妻子也怪丈夫不知艰难，两人常常吵嘴，不如从前相处得好。上海荣升里的妇女代表顾大姐，生了十四个子女，现在身体非常虚弱，下雪天也出汗。有许多职工因为孩子过多，不但没有工夫去教育孩子，反而常常打骂孩子，即便孩子有病也不能及时治疗。这些现象各地都有。因此，一般父母为了自己和子女的切身利益，迫切地要求节制生育。他们的要求是完全合理的。
    农民现在也开始提出节制生育的要求。解放以前，农民生活极端贫苦，农村中溺婴现象十分严重，婴儿死亡率也很高。近年来农民生活获得稳步的改善，溺婴现象大为减少，婴儿死亡率大为降低，农村人口的增长速度也就大大加快了。根据许多典型地区调查材料推算：自从政府提倡和推行新法接生以后，目前全国农村中每年平均比解放前多五百万左右的婴儿摆脱了死亡的威胁。这当然是值得庆幸的。但是，因为农村人口增长太快，影响农民生活的改善，这也使农民群众特别是青年农民感觉到有节制生育的必要。河北玉田县举办过一个避孕展览会，七天中观众达五万多人。有些市镇运到一些避孕药物和书籍，很快就被抢购一空。由此可见，农村中的避孕问题，也是迫切地需要解决的。
    几年以来，我国的人口每年大约增长2.2％左右，超过世界上别的一切国家。同时，我国的工业生产平均每年增长10％左右，农业生产平均每年增长5％左右。这是很高的经济发展速度。正是由于我国的工农业比我国人口增长得更要迅速，保证了我国人民生活仍然能够逐年有所改善。但是，如果人口增长得慢一些，那么，人民生活的改善就会更快一些，这是很明显的道理。在这种情况下，我们主张在全国范围内，除了人口特别稀少的少数民族地区以外，都应该适当地提倡节制生育。这不但适合每个家庭和每一个人的当前利益，而且也适合国家的社会主义建设和人民的长远利益。我们主张适当地节制生育，这同马尔萨斯主义根本不同。马尔萨斯主义的基本论点是认为生活资料生产增长的速度，永远赶不上人口增长的速度。我国的实际生活已经证明这种论断的错误。但是指明马尔萨斯主义的错误，却决不是说生育过早过多过密有什么利益和必要。
    那末，应该怎样节制生育呢？
    第一，应该改变早婚的习惯。结婚愈早，生育愈多，而且对年轻的夫妇所造成的困难愈大。为了节制生育，提倡晚婚是必要的。我国民间过去有早婚的恶习，曾经使青年男女受过很多痛苦。为了改变这种习惯，婚姻法规定了结婚的最低限度的年龄。但是，这种规定并不是说到了最低限度的年龄就必须结婚。事实上，过了二十五岁结婚是有益而无害的。目前很多青年不但不到二十五岁，而且不到二十岁就结婚，结果是造成了生活上的许多困难。在许多农村中，甚至还有低于婚姻法规定的年龄而结婚的现象。因此，必须努力在群众中进行宣传教育，打破早婚的恶习，提倡晚一点结婚。
    第二，推广避孕的方法。在不妨碍健康的条件下，各种有效的避孕方法都应当推行。在同样的条件下，多子女的父母也可以自愿地实行绝育。卫生部门过去在这些方面限制过严是不妥当的，今后应该尽量放宽。
    节制生育是人民群众自己的事情，也是国家的事情。我们应当积极地宣传和提倡，普遍地说明节制生育的积极意义，普遍地正确地传播男女生理常识，广泛地介绍简便、有效的避孕方法，充分地供应价廉、可靠的避孕工具。在这些工作中不容许任何强迫命令。当然，我们也要充分估计到在群众中推行节育工作可能遇到的许多困难。但是，那些困难都可以积极地设法加以克服。只要普遍提倡，同时采取各种具体措施，这个工作一定可以逐渐收到成效。
