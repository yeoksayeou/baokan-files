Xinhua News Agency, March 15th: The People's Liberation Army's military training for all services and arms for 1957 is now fully underway. Today, the last batch of troops joined the training.

Many units began their training earlier this year. On March 4th, many units in the Beijing area solemnly held a ceremony to mark the start of the new year's training. Guided by the military flag, officers and soldiers received a review by their commanders and then began their exercises. On the same day, in the Nanjing area, despite the drizzling rain, various units started their intense operations on the training grounds as scheduled. Many naval vessel units stationed in southern China spent their first training day on March 1st in heavy rain.

In the material preparation for this year's military training, all units have adhered to the principle of diligence and thrift in military training, doing more with less money, and at the same time, trying not to occupy or minimally occupy cultivated land to take care of the interests of the masses. One PLA unit stationed in Wuhan used barren mountains, river滩(tān - river flats), and earthen hills as training grounds, greatly reducing the area of land occupied. They originally planned to use more than 6,000 mu of land, but now only purchased or leased 26 mu. A tank unit built a shooting range using wasteland, saving 800 yuan in land rental fees. Officers and soldiers in many units repaired and made various training equipment themselves, also saving the country a lot of money. One unit repaired and reused more than 2,130 pieces of training equipment, and also made 526 teaching models and training equipment from waste materials, saving an estimated cost of more than 10,000 yuan. A certain anti-aircraft artillery unit used waste materials to make more than 20 kinds of teaching models without spending a penny. In training, all units emphasized improving the utilization rate of time and equipment. A naval unit stipulated that each time a warship goes to sea, it should conduct training in as many areas as possible to reduce the number of voyages. The naval units on the Fujian front line also stipulated specific measures to save fuel and take care of equipment.

Before the start of training, all units adopted the mass line method of combining top-down and bottom-up approaches and carried out full training preparations, greatly enhancing the soldiers' confidence and determination to complete this year's training tasks. The soldiers stated that they would resolutely surpass last year's achievements and strive to be excellent shooters and technical experts in this year's training, in order to better defend the country's socialist construction.

    解放军勤俭练兵
    新年度军事训练全面展开
    据新华社15日讯  中国人民解放军各军种、兵种部队1957年度的军事训练工作，已经全面展开。今天，最后一批部队投入了训练。
    今年许多部队的训练工作都开始得比较早。3月4日，北京地区许多部队隆重举行了新年度训练开始的仪式。在军旗引导下，官兵们接受了首长的检阅，接着就开始了操课。这一天，南京地区细雨蒙蒙，各部队在训练场上按期开始了紧张的操作。驻守祖国南部的许多海军舰艇部队，3月1日在大雨中度过了第一个训练日。
    各部队在今年度军事训练的物质准备工作中，都本着勤俭练兵的方针，少花钱多办事；同时尽量不占用或少占用耕地，照顾群众利益。武汉驻军某部利用荒山、河滩、土岗做训练场地，大大减少了占用土地的面积。他们原来计划需用土地六千多亩，现在只征购、租用了二十六亩。某坦克部队利用荒地修了一座靶场，节省土地租用费八百元。许多部队的官兵们自己动手修理和制作各种训练器材，也为国家节省了不少钱。某部把二千一百三十多件训练器材修理后重新利用，还用废旧材料自制了五百二十六件教学模型和训练器材，估计节省费用在一万元以上。某高射炮部队利用废料自制的二十多种教学模型，没有花一分钱。在训练中，各部队重视了提高时间和器材的利用率。海军某部规定：舰艇每一次出海，尽可能进行多种内容的训练，以减少出航次数。福建前线海军部队也规定了节约油料、爱护器材等具体办法。
    各部队在训练开始前，都采取了上下结合的群众路线方法，进行了充分的训练准备工作，大大提高了士兵完成今年训练任务的信心和决心。士兵们纷纷表示，要坚决突破去年的成绩，争取在今年练兵中做个优等射手和技术能手，以便更好地保卫祖国的社会主义建设。
