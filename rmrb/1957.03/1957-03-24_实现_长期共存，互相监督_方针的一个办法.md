Lan Ting introduces the experience of the Taiyuan Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in organizing inspection teams to examine the implementation of united front policies by Party organizations at all levels in Taiyuan, based on the suggestions of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

　　I fully agree with the reports made to the conference by Premier Zhou and Vice-Chairman Chen.

　　The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the CPPCC has done a great deal of work in the past year, achieving significant results in areas such as political consultation on major domestic and international events and local affairs, connecting with people from all walks of life, adjusting internal relations within the people's united front, organizing inspections and investigations by people from all sectors, and organizing learning activities for people from all sectors. Now, I would like to express some opinions only on political consultation work and organizing representatives from all aspects to inspect the implementation of united front policies.

　　In the past year, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the CPPCC held one plenary session, fourteen sessions of the Standing Committee, and sixty-two various symposiums and report meetings. Major issues that have been consulted and discussed include the "National Agricultural Development Program," the "Model Charter for Agricultural Production Cooperatives," the "Handling of War Criminals," the "Ten Major Relationships" spoken of by Chairman Mao, the "Issue of Intellectuals," the "Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme," "Mobilizing All Positive Factors to Serve Socialism," the "Taiyuan Municipal Capitalist Industrial and Commercial Transformation Plan and Handicraft Transformation Plan," the "Taiyuan Municipal Housing Transformation Plan," and supporting Egypt's anti-aggression struggle, etc. The methods of consultation and discussion varied depending on the content. For example, the central theme of the second plenary session of the first session was "Mobilizing All Positive Factors to Serve Socialism," which required gathering wisdom and soliciting opinions on a larger scale. We summarized past experiences and lessons, analyzed the situation at the time, and took concrete measures to dispel various concerns and change the past phenomenon of more praise and less criticism, and extensively carried out criticism and self-criticism. The democratic parties and people's organizations carried out a series of organized activities through their members, making the meeting full of a democratic and united atmosphere, and a lively and vigorous new atmosphere emerged. Many opinions were put forward on the shortcomings and errors in the work of the Party and the government, and criticisms and exposures were made of the unhealthy work styles of some cadres. A total of more than 200 criticisms and suggestions were put forward. This not only strengthened unity, educated cadres, and mobilized the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life, but also provided favorable conditions for the Party and the government to improve their work and leadership. Another example is the handling of war criminals, which required soliciting opinions from all aspects of society and people from all strata. Therefore, a enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee with more than 200 people was held, and general and group discussions were conducted to allow people from all aspects to fully express their opinions and reach a consensus. The attendees, especially the families of the victims, were extremely indignant at the war criminals, but they also expressed that personal grievances should be subordinate to the interests of the entire people, and believed that the policies of the Party and the government were completely correct. Another example is the consultation on the city's housing transformation, which, in addition to inviting representatives from all walks of life, also included tenants, landlords, and housing management personnel. Because they have different views on housing transformation and can reflect the opinions and requirements of people from all strata, this helps the government take care of the interests of people from all strata when revising the plan.

　　In short, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the CPPCC has consulted and discussed many major issues in the past year and has adhered to the system of the Standing Committee meeting once a month. I believe that political consultation on these issues is one of the main contents and main forms of the "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" between the Communist Party and the democratic parties and non-party figures. It can enable all parties to reach a consensus on various major issues after full consultation and communication between the Party and the government and the broad masses of the people.

　　In the second half of last year, the Standing Committee, based on the suggestion of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the CCP, organized non-Party members to inspect the implementation of the united front policies by Party organizations at all levels in the city on two occasions. In June, a 30-member inspection team composed of democratic parties and non-party democratic figures inspected 18 units, including government agencies, schools, hospitals, state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private enterprises under the city. In November, a second inspection was organized, with a total of more than 50 people participating, and six inspection groups were organized separately for the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), the China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association, religious circles, ethnic minorities, and returned overseas Chinese. The members of each group were deployed by the democratic parties and people's organizations themselves. The units to be inspected were also selected by each group themselves. The scope of the inspection involved more than 90 units and contacted 1,231 people. Judging from the results of the inspection, the relationship between the Party and non-Party members is basically united and harmonious; the members of the Communist Party and the democratic parties have a further understanding of the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision"; the level of united front policies has been improved; and the work on ethnic minorities, religions, and returned overseas Chinese has also been improved. This is the main aspect. However, many problems have also been discovered, and these problems are diverse: there are relations between the Party and non-Party members; there are relations between the Han and Hui nationalities; there are relations between public and private and labor and capital; there are also relations between private individuals; there are relations between the Party and democratic parties; there are relations between individuals; and there are also relations between leaders and those being led, etc. From the nature of the problems, there are ideological problems, work style problems, work problems, policy problems, and leadership problems. In short, they are all internal problems of the people. From the perspective of responsibility, both the Party and non-Party members have responsibilities, but the Party is the main one; both the leaders and those being led have responsibilities, but the leaders are the main ones. Many problems are also caused by lack of experience and misunderstandings. Experience has proven that as long as there is close contact and sincerity, many problems are easy to solve. In short, many problems have been solved through this inspection of united front policies.

　　First, the contradictions within the people have been adjusted, the relations between all parties have been improved, and the unity within the people has been enhanced. For example, there are disunity phenomena in some joint state-private enterprises. The main contradictions are threefold, namely the contradictions between public and private, labor and capital, and private individuals. The contradictions between labor and capital and between private individuals were brought about by the old enterprises, and the new enterprises have not yet resolved these contradictions, thus affecting the unity between public and private. The China National Democratic Construction Association inspection team carried out a series of work through the Party and non-Party members, and educated their members and the masses they contacted through the China National Democratic Construction Association organizations in their units, carried out criticism and self-criticism, and resolved the contradictions between private individuals. At the same time, it suggested that the Party and government leaders conduct united front policy education for employees and improve the relationship between labor and capital, which undoubtedly also promoted the normalization of the relationship between public and private. Like the China National Democratic Construction Association, other groups have solved many relationship problems, strengthened the unity between the Party and non-Party members, and mobilized the positive factors of all parties.

　　Second, the role of mutual supervision between the Party and the democratic parties and non-party democratic figures has been brought into play. The democratic parties and non-party democratic figures believe that organizing such an inspection is the Party's trust in them, which makes them practically realize that the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" put forward by the Party Central Committee is neither a means nor empty talk, and dispels many doubts. In the inspection, their enthusiasm and organizational role were fully brought into play, and they put forward many beneficial opinions to the Party and government leaders. The Party and government leaders also conducted inspections based on the opinions put forward and drafted plans to improve their work and solve the problems. They solved the problems according to the priority and urgency of the problems, and basically achieved that everything was implemented. All groups responded well and believed that it was also an extremely profound and practical united front policy education for themselves. Ideologically, the problem of "whether or not to supervise" and "how to supervise" the Communist Party and the various works led by the Party has been resolved for non-Party members.

　　Third, the content of the CPPCC's work has been enriched and the scope of consultation has been expanded. It is the first time for the CPPCC organization to organize non-Party members to inspect the Party's united front work, which has also added new content to the CPPCC's work and enlivened the CPPCC's work. In the inspection, the groups conducted multiple consultations and discussions with the Party, government, labor union and Communist Youth League organizations of the units where the problems were found, and many problems that could be solved were generally solved, which expanded the scope of political consultation to the grassroots organizations. The work of the CPPCC has also become more in-depth and extensive.

　　I believe that organizing such an inspection is very necessary, which is a better way to realize "mutual supervision" between the Party and the democratic parties and non-party democratic figures.

　　实现“长期共存，互相监督”方针的一个办法
    兰　亭介绍太原市政协根据中共太原市委的建议，组织检查组检查太原各级党组织执行统战政策的经验
    我完全同意周总理和陈副主席向大会所作的报告。
    政协太原市委员会一年来做了不少的工作，如就国内外大事和当地大事进行政治协商、联系社会人士、调整人民统一战线内部关系、组织各界人士进行视察和检查工作、组织各界人士学习等方面均获得了显著的成绩。现在我仅就政治协商工作和组织各方面代表人物检查统一战线政策的执行情况发表一些意见。
    政协太原市委员会一年来计召开全体委员会一次，常务委员会十四次，各种座谈会、报告会六十二次。经过协商讨论的重大问题有“全国农业发展纲要”、“农业生产合作社示范章程”、“处理战争罪犯问题”、毛主席所讲的“十大关系”、“知识分子问题”、“汉语拼音方案”、
  “调动一切积极因素为社会主义服务问题”、“太原市资本主义工商业改造规划和手工业改造规划”、“太原市房产改造方案”和支援埃及的反侵略斗争等等。协商讨论的方法是因内容而有所不同。如一届二次全体会议的中心议题是“调动一切积极因素为社会主义服务”，这就需要在更大的范围内集思广益征求意见，我们总结了以往的经验教训，分析了当时的情况，采取了具体措施，解除了各种顾虑，转变了过去赞扬多、批评少的现象，广泛地开展了批评与自我批评。各民主党派和人民团体通过自己的成员进行了一系列的有组织的活动，使会议充满了民主团结的气氛，出现了生动活泼的新气象。对党和政府工作中的缺点和错误提出了不少意见，对某些干部的不良作风进行了批评和揭发。计共提出批评建议二○○余件。这不仅加强了团结，教育了干部，调动了各界人士的积极性，同时也给党和政府提供了改进工作、改进领导的有利条件。又如关于战争罪犯的处理问题，需要广泛征求各方面人士和各阶层群众的意见，因而举行了二○○余人的常委扩大会，进行了大会和小组讨论，使各方面人士都充分发表了自己的意见，取得了一致的认识。到会的人尤其被害家属对战争罪犯极为愤慨，但又表示个人恩怨要服从全体人民的利益，认为党和政府的政策是完全正确的。又如对本市房产改造的协商，除约请了各界代表人物外，并吸收了房客、房主和房产管理人员参加。由于他们对房产改造具有不同的看法，能够反映各阶层群众的意见和要求，这就有助于政府修订方案时照顾到各阶层群众的利益。
    总之，一年来太原市政协协商讨论了不少重大问题，坚持了常委会一月一次的制度。我认为这些问题的政治协商就是共产党与各民主党派和无党派人士“长期共存、互相监督”的主要内容和主要形式之一。它能够在各种重大问题上经过充分协商之后使各方面取得一致的意见和沟通党与政府和广大人民的关系。
    去年的下半年常委会曾根据中共太原市委的建议，先后两次组织党外人士检查了本市各级党组织对统一战线政策执行的情况。六月份由各民主党派和无党派民主人士组织了一个三十人的检查团，检查了市属政府机关、学校、医院，国营、地方国营和公私合营企业等十八个单位。十一月间又组织了二次检查，参加的人共五十余名，分别组织了民革、民盟、民建、宗教、少数民族、归国华侨等六个检查组。各组的成员由各民主党派和人民团体自行调配。检查的单位也由各组自行选择。检查的范围共涉及九十多个单位，接触了一、二三一人。从检查的结果来看，党与党外人士的关系基本上是团结的、融洽的；共产党与民主党派成员对“长期共存，互相监督”的方针有了进一步的认识；统一战线政策水平有所提高；民族、宗教、归侨等方面的工作也有所改进。这是主要方面。但也发现了不少问题，这些问题是多种多样的：有党与党外人士的关系；有汉族与回族的关系；有公、私和劳、资之间的关系；也有私私之间的关系；有党与民主党派之间的关系；有个人与个人的关系；还有领导与被领导的关系等等。从问题的性质上看，有思想问题、作风问题、工作问题、政策问题，也有领导问题。总之，都是人民内部的问题。从责任方面看，党内外都有责任，但党是主要的；领导与被领导也都有责任，但领导是主要的。许多问题又是由于缺乏经验和出于误会所引起的。经验证明只要能密切联系，相见以诚，许多都是容易解决的问题。总之，通过此次统战政策的检查解决了不少问题。
    第一，调整了人民内部的矛盾改善了各方面的关系，增强了人民内部的团结。如某些公私合营企业存在不团结的现象，主要矛盾有三，即公私、劳资、私私之间的矛盾，劳资矛盾和私私矛盾又都是旧企业带来的，新企业还没有解决这些矛盾，因而影响了公私之间的团结。民建检查组通过党内党外进行了一系列的工作，并通过所在单位的民建组织对自己的成员和所联系的群众进行了教育，开展了批评和自我批评解决了私私之间的矛盾，同时建议党政领导对职工进行了统战政策教育，改善了劳资之间的关系，这无疑也促进了公私关系的正常化。其他各组和民建一样，解决了不少关系问题，加强了党与党外人士的团结，调动了各方面的积极因素。
    第二，发挥了党与各民主党派、无党派民主人士相互监督的作用。各民主党派和无党派民主人士认为组织这样的检查是党对他们的信任，使他们实际体会到党中央提出的“长期共存、互相监督”的方针不是手段也不是空话，解除了许多疑虑。在检查中充分发挥了他们的积极性和组织作用，向党政领导提出许多有益的意见，党政领导方面也根据所提意见进行了检查并拟出改进工作和解决问题的方案，分别问题的主次、缓急进行了解决，基本上做到了件件有着落。各组反映良好并认为对自己也是一次极为深刻和实际的统战政策教育。从思想上解决了党外人士对共产党和党所领导的各种工作“能不能监督”“如何监督”的问题。
    第三，丰富了政协工作的内容，扩大了协商范围。政协组织党外人士检查党的统战工作还是第一次，也给政协工作增加了新内容并且活跃了政协的工作，在检查中各组将发现的问题和所在单位的党政工团组织进行了多次协商和讨论，许多能够解决的问题一般都得到了解决，这就把政治协商的范围扩大到基层组织中。政协的工作也随之更加深入更加广泛了。
    我认为组织这样的检查是十分必要的，这是实现党和民主党派，无党派民主人士“相互监督”的一种较好方法。
