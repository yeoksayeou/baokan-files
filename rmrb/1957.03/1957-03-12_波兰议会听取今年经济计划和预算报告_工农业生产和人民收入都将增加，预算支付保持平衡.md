Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 11th—The Polish Parliament plenary session reconvened on the 9th and conducted the first reading of the draft National Economic Plan and the draft budget for Poland in 1957.

    Chairman of the Planning Commission of the Council of Ministers, Jędrychowski, delivered a report on the 1957 National Economic Plan. He said that this year, the total output value of socialist industry will increase by 4% compared to last year, and commodity production will increase by 5.2%. The plan stipulates more reserves than in previous years. This year, agricultural production is planned to increase by 3.4% compared to last year.

    From the perspective of long-term development, the principle of faster development of the production of the means of production remains unchanged. Currently, the most important task in heavy industry is to normalize production conditions and create conditions for further increasing coal production. Among the various industrial sectors, the chemical industry will see the largest increase in production this year, while the production of defense industries will significantly decrease.

    Jędrychowski said that this year, the growth rate of real wages and real income in Poland will be faster than originally stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. The total wage bill for 1957 is 117.4 billion zlotys, an increase of over 10 billion zlotys compared to the actual figure for last year. In 1957, due to the increase in commodity production and higher purchase prices, farmers' income will increase by 5.5 billion zlotys.

    Through maximum efforts made by reducing investment plans and defense expenditures, individual consumption in 1957 will increase by 20.5 billion zlotys (an increase of 11.2%) compared to 1956.

    The foreign trade deficit in 1957 will reach 838.8 million rubles. The main reasons are the decrease in exports of coal and coke by about one-third, a decrease in timber exports by about 60%, a decrease in cement by 72.5%, and an increase in imports of raw materials and finished products.

    According to the draft plan, the number of employees in the socialist sector (excluding agricultural cooperatives) will increase by 236,000 compared to 1956. However, the entire employment problem will be difficult to solve in 1957.

    Polish Minister of Finance, Tadeusz Dietrich, delivered a report on the draft budget for 1957 at the meeting. He said that last year, Poland's industrial output increased by nearly 10%, with a larger increase in consumer goods output, agricultural product output increased by about 6%, foreign trade expanded, and the number of retail businesses also increased significantly. However, last year was not a prosperous year. The tasks of accumulation in the socialist economy and reducing costs and increasing labor productivity were not fully completed. In the second half of the year, due to the payment of wage arrears from previous years and the gradual adjustment of wages, the government had to struggle to maintain the balance of the budget.

    As it enters 1957, the country's economic situation is balanced, although it is still somewhat strained. According to the draft budget for 1957, revenue is 140.3 billion zlotys, and expenditure is 138.8 billion zlotys. Among the revenue, funds provided by the socialist economy account for 102.3 billion zlotys. Among the expenditures, national economic expenditure accounts for 75 billion zlotys, social and cultural expenses account for 40 billion zlotys, defense expenditure accounts for 10.2 billion zlotys, and administrative expenses account for 5.6 billion zlotys. The budget surplus of 1.5 billion zlotys is specifically used for bank loans.

    The main factors for balancing budget payments are tightening investment expenditures and reducing defense expenditures.

### 波兰议会听取今年经济计划和预算报告  工农业生产和人民收入都将增加，预算支付保持平衡

    波兰议会听取今年经济计划和预算报告
    工农业生产和人民收入都将增加，预算支付保持平衡
    据新华社华沙11日电　波兰议会全体会议9日复会，对波兰1957年国民经济计划草案和预算草案进行了一读。
    部长会议计划委员会主席英德里霍夫斯基作了关于1957年国民经济计划的报告。他说，今年社会主义工业总产量将比去年增加4％，商品生产增加5.2％。计划所规定的储备比前几年要多些。今年规定农业生产比去年增加3.4％。
    从长期发展的远景来看，生产资料生产的发展较为迅速的原则是没有改变的。目前重工业中最重要的是使生产情况正常化和为进一步增加采煤量创造条件。今年各个工业部门中增产最多的是化学工业，而国防工业的生产将有显著的减少。
    英德里霍夫斯基说，今年波兰实际工资和实际收入的增长速度将比五年计划原来规定的速度为快。1957年的工资总额为一千一百七十四亿兹罗提，即比去年的实际数字增加一百多亿兹罗提。在1957年，由于商品生产的增加和提高收购价格等原因，农民的收入将增加五十五亿兹罗提。
    通过削减投资计划和国防费用而作出的最大限度的努力，1957年个人消费将比1956年增加二百零五亿兹罗提（增加11.2％）。
    1957年对外贸易逆差将达到八亿三千八百万卢布。主要原因是由于煤和焦炭的出口减少大约三分之一、木材出口减少大约60％、水泥减少72.5％，同时原料和制成品的进口将有增加。
    根据计划草案，社会主义部分（不包括农业合作社）中的就业人数将比1956年增加二十三万六千人。但整个就业问题在1957年内还很难解决。
    波兰财政部长塔·迪特里赫在会议上作了关于1957年预算草案的报告。他说，去年波兰工业产量增加了将近10％，其中消费品产量有较大的增加，农业产品产量增加了大约6％，对外贸易扩大了，零售业的数量也增加了很多。但是，去年并不是一个宽裕的年头。社会主义经济的积累任务以及减低成本和提高劳动生产率的任务没有全部完成。下半年由于要支付前几年的工资尾欠以及逐渐调整工资，政府不得不为保持预算的平衡而斗争。
    在进入1957年的时候，国家的经济状况是平衡的，虽然还不免有些紧张的成分。根据1957年的预算草案，收入是一千四百零三亿兹罗提，支出是一千三百八十八亿兹罗提。在收入中，社会主义经济所提供的款项占一千零二十三亿兹罗提。在支出中，国民经济支出占七百五十亿兹罗提，社会和文化费用占四百亿兹罗提，国防费用占一百零二亿兹罗提，行政费用占五十六亿兹罗提。预算结余的十五亿兹罗提专作银行贷款之用。
    使预算支付平衡的主要因素是紧缩投资支出，减少国防费用等。
