    The US Economic Situation
    --From 1956 to 1957--
    Ji Long
    (I) Continued Rise in 1956
    The following figures for the three years 1954-56 show that the US economy continued to rise in 1956.
    		  1956　1955　1954
  Gross National Product　412.0　390.9　360.7
    (US$100 million)
  Index of Industrial Production　143　139　125
    (1947-1949=100)
  Business Capital Expenditure　35.0　28.7　26.8
    (US$100 million)
  Personal Income　325.0　306.1　287.3
    (US$100 million)
  Number of Employed　64,988　63,193　61,238
    (thousands)
  Number of Unemployed　2,386　2,654　3,230
    (thousands)
  Department Store Retail Sales　124　119　111
  Index (1947-1949=100)
    1956 not only saw an increase in annual figures, but also a trend of rising figures from the early to the later months throughout the year. For example, the annual rate of gross national product in December 1956 reached over US$420 billion, and the industrial production index in December was 147, both higher than the figures for the previous months of the same year.
    A prominent factor contributing to the continued rise of the US economy in 1956 was the increase in business capital expenditure. US business capital expenditure increased by US$1.9 billion in 1955 compared to 1954, and by US$6.3 billion in 1956 compared to 1955. If we compare the increase in capital expenditure with the increase in gross national product in the same year, the figures are 6.3% for 1955 and 30% for 1956, which further shows that the increase in capital expenditure in 1956 was considerable. In 1956, the industries with larger capital expenditure amounts and greater increases were automobile, steel, non-ferrous metal smelting, machinery manufacturing, chemical, and paper-making, all of which are enterprises with good sales, or fierce competition, or technological innovation needs.
    Another important factor supporting the continued rise of the US economy in 1956 was the activity of the construction industry. The value of new public and private construction in the US in 1956 was about US$44.2 billion (an increase of US$1.2 billion over 1955), accounting for more than 10% of the gross national product. Its supporting role for the US economy is very obvious. Large amounts of business capital expenditure, government construction and public works, population growth and movement, and the long-term unmet needs for housing, etc., constituted the basic factors for the continued rise of construction in 1956.
    When analyzing the factors for the continued rise of the US economy in 1956, we should also note the role of US government spending. US government spending was US$64.6 billion in the 1954-55 fiscal year, US$66.5 billion in the 1955-56 budget, and US$68.9 billion in the 1956-57 budget, with increases every year. The amount of government spending averaged about 18% of the gross national product each year. It is estimated that the total annual spending of the federal, state, and local governments in the United States is about US$100 billion, nearly a quarter of the total gross national product in 1956. Such a large and continuously increasing amount of government spending, especially expenditures related to military orders and public works, is very important for stimulating and supporting the US economy.
    (II) The Dark Side of the Rise
    Although the US economy in 1956 generally continued to rise, there was also a dark side to this rise during the year.
    First, the overall economic situation was not a stable, continuous rise, but rather showed ups and downs. For example, the industrial production index and the department store retail index for all months of the year after seasonal adjustment reflected this situation.
    Industrial Production Index　Department Store
    (1947-1949=100)		Retail Index
    (1947-1949=100)
  December 1955　144　123
  January 1956　143　124
    February　143　118
    March　141　122
    April　143　122
    May　141　122
    June　141　124
    July　136　128
    August　142　128
    September　145　129
    October　146　122
    November　147　131
    December　147　130
    The stock market also fluctuated in 1956. There were major ups and downs in late January, mid-February, late May, early October, and late November. It is generally believed that this is a reflection of the instability of the US economy.
    Second, the rise was not comprehensive, but rather unbalanced, with different economic sectors rising and falling differently. For example, the machinery manufacturing industry was rising, while the textile and clothing industry and the coal mining industry were basically weak and declining. The construction industry as a whole was rising, but residential construction was declining. The annual production of automobiles was 6.65 million vehicles, a decrease of about 2.28 million vehicles compared to 1955. The annual production of steel was 115 million tons, a decrease of 2 million tons compared to 1955.
    Third, several important factors that have supported the US economy in recent years have shown signs of recession. The automobile industry, which played a significant supporting role in the rise of the US economy in 1955, reduced production by about 26% in 1956 compared to 1955. Residential construction experienced a clear decline: about 1,328,000 new residential units were built in 1955, but this fell to about 1,120,000 units in 1956. As a prominent factor supporting the rise of the US economy in 1956, business capital expenditure also showed a gradual decline in its rate of increase when calculated as an annual rate based on the quarterly figures for the whole year. According to reports in the December 15, 1956 issue of "Business Week" and the January 1, 1957 issue of the London Financial Times, many important companies' capital expenditure plans for 1957, formulated in 1956, also indicated that the rate of increase in capital expenditure would continue to slow down, meaning that the upward trend would weaken.
    Fourth, the rate of increase in gross national product declined. The gross national product in 1955 increased by about 8.4% compared to 1954, while the gross national product in 1956 increased by only 5.5% compared to 1955. Moreover, the price increase in 1956 was much greater than in 1955, and even the US Department of Commerce admitted that "about half of the increase in gross national product in 1956 was due to price increases," so the actual increase was even smaller.
    Fifth, some important factors supporting the rise relied on unprecedentedly large amounts of loans. Automobiles and durable consumer goods relied on consumer credit loans; residential construction relied on mortgage loans; and enterprises relied on commercial loans to provide funds for increasing factory buildings and equipment and purchasing raw materials and commodity inventories. The rapid rise and the unprecedentedly large numbers of these loans were closely related to the large sales of automobiles and other durable consumer goods, the prosperity of construction, and the high level of business capital expenditure. According to statistics from the US President's Council of Economic Advisers, US private debt increased by US$35 billion in 1956, equivalent to the total amount of business capital expenditure for the whole year. According to an estimate in the December 21, 1956 issue of "U.S. News & World Report," total US private debt amounted to about US$137 billion, of which US$95 billion was in residential mortgage loans, US$32 billion in automobile and other installment debt, US$4 billion in department store charge accounts, and US$6 billion in other private debt. The importance of these loans to the current US economy is very obvious.
    (III) The Ominous Signs in 1957
    The above-mentioned dark side obviously continued to develop after entering 1957. Therefore, at the very beginning of 1957, many pessimistic phenomena appeared in the economic sphere:
    First, business capital expenditure decreased. US business capital expenditure increased by US$6.3 billion in 1956 compared to 1955, an increase of 22%. According to a survey by McGraw-Hill Publishing Company at the end of 1956 and the beginning of 1957, the planned US business capital expenditure for 1957 was about US$39 billion, an increase of US$4 billion compared to 1956, an increase of 11%. The increase in 1957 was significantly reduced compared to 1956. However, shortly after the beginning of 1957, US companies reduced their capital expenditure plans for the year again. According to recent estimates, the total business capital expenditure for 1957 will be reduced to US$36 billion to US$37 billion, which will actually be equivalent to the increase caused by price increases. Therefore, in reality, 1957 will only maintain the level of 1956. In January of this year, General Motors announced the postponement of the construction of two new assembly plants, and General Electric decided to postpone four construction projects. These actions by these monopoly capital enterprises to successively contract capital expenditure at the beginning of the year are extremely noteworthy trends.
    Second, residential construction further declined. According to an estimate by the National Association of Home Builders in 1956, new residential construction in 1957 would be about 1,120,000 units, a decrease of 16% compared to 1955. Shortly after the beginning of this year, the situation became even worse than originally estimated, and it is estimated that new residential construction in 1957 will be reduced by another 20% compared to the original estimate, with only about 900,000 units. If business capital expenditure is significantly reduced in 1957, the entire construction sector will inevitably experience a greater decline. The refrigerator, television, washing machine, furniture, and other industries, which are closely related to construction, have also simultaneously presented a bleak picture.
    Third, automobile sales were poor. The original estimate for automobile sales was relatively optimistic, with the expectation that 6.5 million passenger cars could be sold in 1957, and the total sales volume of automobiles could reach more than 7 million vehicles. However, the situation in the first month or two of 1957 was not as good as ideal, and it is now estimated that passenger car sales will be within 6 million vehicles, and the total sales volume of automobiles for the whole year will be roughly the same as in 1956, with little hope of a major increase. According to an estimate in 1955, the US automobile industry used 20% of the nation's steel, 65% of raw rubber, 70% of plate glass, 60% of malleable iron, 68% of furniture leather, 23% of nickel, 25% of lead, 12% of copper, and 10% of aluminum. The impact of the inability of automobile sales to increase on related industries cannot be ignored.
    Fourth, industrial orders decreased. First, a significant decrease in orders appeared in the steel industry and the machine tool manufacturing industry, which have always been indicators of industrial ups and downs. It is estimated that orders will continue to decrease. A situation of supply exceeding demand will soon appear for some types of steel products. The machine tool manufacturing industry is continuing to decline along the trend of each quarter of 1956. When business capital expenditure was high in 1956, orders for machine tool manufacturing had already declined, foreshadowing the trend of reduced capital expenditure in 1957, and the further reduction of business capital expenditure in 1957 means that the future of the entire industry will point to a decline.
    Fifth, the stock market was unstable. The New York stock market fell sharply twice in February. It is speculated that this was influenced by former President Hoover's pessimistic view of the current US economic outlook. Others say that it was due to the decline in the profit margins of several large companies in 1956 (for example, General Motors, Ford Motor Company, U.S. Steel Corporation, Monsanto Chemical Company, etc.). Still others say that it was due to high market interest rates and tight money. Obviously, such fluctuations in the stock market cannot be explained by any one of the above-mentioned simple reasons. To a certain extent, this volatility is a reflection of the instability of the US economic outlook for 1957.
    (IV) The Contradiction Between Productivity and Consumption
    The above-mentioned phenomena are diverse and superficial. In summary, it is still a matter of the contradiction between productivity and consumption, or simply put, the problem of commodity sales. The decline in automobile sales and the recession in residential construction are all problems of this kind. The decline in business capital expenditure is also a problem of this kind, because if sales continue to expand, companies will inevitably carry out capital expenditure to increase productivity and expand reproduction. If sales become a problem, companies will naturally not continue to carry out capital expenditure to increase productivity.
    Today in the United States, there is a problem of difficulty in selling goods. Taking the textile and clothing industry, a non-durable consumer goods industry, as an example, production in 1954 was still at the level of 1947-1949, rose by 9% in 1955, and stagnated again in 1956. According to a survey in 1956, although the population had increased, the sales volume of men's formal suits in the United States in 1955 decreased, and the sales of women's formal suits also decreased from an average of one suit every three years per person to an average of one suit every four years per person. The amount of fiber used by the textile industry can also reflect the sluggish sales of the US textile and clothing industry - in 1942, the textile industry used 6.9 billion pounds of fiber, 6.8 billion pounds in 1950, and 6.7 billion pounds in 1955.
    The sales problem of durable consumer goods can be seen from the decline in sales and the reduction in production of washing machines, televisions, refrigerators, automobiles, etc. What needs to be particularly pointed out here is that the sales of these durable consumer goods and residential construction have seen a significant increase in recent years, and can still maintain a considerable level of production and sales. This is not because there is sufficient purchasing power in the market, but mainly because it relies on various loans. Taking automobiles as an example, before 1950, 40%-50% of new car sales in the United States were purchased on installment credit. In 1955, the number of cars purchased on credit increased to more than 60%, and in August and September 1956, it increased to more than 80%, meaning that at least four out of every five new cars sold were purchased on installment credit. It is estimated that 6.6 million of the 55 million families and other "spending units" in the United States have to pay more than 20% of their after-tax income to repay installment debt, accounting for 12% of all "spending units."
    It is very clear that there is a fundamental and serious contradiction between productivity and consumption in the current US economy. The sales of many commodities are sluggish or declining, while the sales of another part of the commodities rely on loan methods, spending tomorrow's money today, and pre-spending purchasing power to strive for sales. This method of pre-spending purchasing power can play a considerable role, but it is ultimately limited, and its effect will also diminish. Although US private debt continued to increase in 1956, the rate of increase decreased compared to 1955. Taking consumer credit loans as an example, the average monthly increase was US$500 million in 1955, but this has dropped to an average monthly increase of US$150 million in 1956. Obviously, the method of relying on loans and other pre-spending purchasing power to maintain and expand sales is not sustainable, and the decline in automobiles and residential construction in 1956 is the best illustration.
    Because commodity sales are problematic, US industry has always been underutilized. Despite this, in recent years, US companies have been carrying out large-scale capital expenditure, which is to expand productivity. This will only make the contradiction between productivity and consumption more acute. Taking the automobile industry as an example, a total of 6.65 million cars were produced in 1956, but it is estimated that the production capacity of the US automobile industry in 1956 reached 10 million vehicles, and some expansion projects will continue to be carried out in 1957. Obviously, carrying out large-scale capital expenditure to expand productivity in the absence of increased sales cannot be sustained, and will only make the sales problem more serious in the future. However, fierce competition forces many industries to step up capital expenditure, attempting to seize the market with new technologies, new products, and low costs, and as a result, the overall sales situation of commodities will only become more difficult.
    (V) Inflation and Tight Liquidity
    The continuous increase in various loans and the continued implementation of capital expenditure require a large amount of funds. If sufficient funds are supplied in this area, the result will quickly develop into serious inflation. So far, the US financial authorities have adhered to a policy of curbing inflation, adopting measures such as raising interest rates and discount rates, selling securities, tightening loan conditions, and controlling the amount of currency in circulation. However, it is impossible to prevent inflation in the long term under the continuous impact of continuously increasing government spending and huge amounts of credit. Prices in 1956 showed an increase that has not been seen in recent years. According to the wholesale price index (1947-1949=100) of the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the US Department of Labor, it was 111.3 in December 1955 and 116.2 in December 1956, an increase of about 4.4%. It is estimated that it will increase by another 5% in 1957. This inflation that has already occurred is actually the consequence of the "prosperity" of the US economy in the past two years. Judging from the current price increases, material supply, and the amount and velocity of currency circulation, the situation is not yet serious. However, the constant emphasis on the threat of serious inflation from all sides shows that if the economic rise of 1955 and 1956 continues to rely on credit expansion, the consequences will be very serious.
    In fact, the current US economy is not only facing the threat of inflation. Some people in the US business community believe that the real danger is the harm of deflation. In order to raise funds for various loans and capital expenditures, industrial and commercial enterprises and the financial community have issued more stocks and bonds, used surpluses, sold inventory securities, raised deposit interest rates, and reduced reserves, reaching a state of almost "draining the pond to catch the fish" in the second half of 1956. The liquidity ratio of banks has decreased, the "composition" of assets has changed, commercial banks have almost reached the limit of lending, and there is a general phenomenon of insufficient funds and tight liquidity in the market. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities for all US companies other than banks and insurance companies was 53.5% on September 30, 1955, but had fallen to 46.2% by September 30, 1956. Under such circumstances, it is inevitable that credit purchases, mortgages, and general purchases will decrease, and companies will reduce inventories and expansions. The reduction of business capital expenditure, the poor sales of automobiles, and the decline in residential construction in 1957 appeared under these circumstances.
    Whether to adopt a contractionary monetary policy to curb price increases or to loosen credit to avoid the dangers of deflation has been a contentious issue in the United States from 1956 to 1957 that has not been resolved to this day. This debate reflects the difficult situation of the US economy today, and this situation cannot be solved by monetary policy alone. Eisenhower mentioned many times during the 1956 election that he wanted to curb inflation, but inflation continued to develop, precisely because this is not a technical monetary issue, but a major issue involving a wide range of aspects.
    (VI) Huge Government Spending
    Supporting the market by pre-spending consumers' purchasing power and expanding capital expenditure cannot solve the problem, and has already produced serious difficulties, as mentioned above. Can we export outwards and open up foreign markets? The biggest problem is that the international market of the capitalist world also lacks purchasing power for US goods - the dollar shortage. The socialist international market, on the other hand, does not play a major role for US goods due to various restrictions on trade by the United States. The United States still adopts measures to restrict imports and high tariffs to protect the sales of domestic goods in the domestic market. Therefore, it is difficult to immediately increase imports in large quantities to exchange for commodity exports.
    At present, the only method that the US ruling group places its hope on and continues to strengthen its reliance on is to maintain the market and stimulate production by expanding government spending. The draft federal budget for 1957-1958 is the largest budget in the history of the United States in peacetime. According to George Shea of the Wall Street Journal, the receipts and expenditures of this budget are net figures. In fact, calculated by the gross amount of receipts and expenditures, this budget will receive 99 billion US dollars and spend 96 billion US dollars, equivalent to about a quarter of the annual rate of gross national product of 414 billion US dollars in the third quarter of 1956, exceeding the ratio at the peak of the Korean War in 1953. He cited the percentage of budget expenditures to gross national product for several years, which is very interesting:
  1929-33	8%-14%
  1941	20%
  1950	14%
  1953	23%
  1956 (according to the total value of the third quarter)	19%
  1957 (according to the total value of the third quarter of 1956)	24% Even if calculated according to the currently estimated gross national product of 435 billion US dollars in 1957, the ratio is equal to the peak period of the Korean War in 1953 - 23%. The US government is increasingly entering the US market as the largest employer, and this has almost become an inevitable future. Herbert Koshetz pointed out in the "New York Times" on January 20, 1957, that the US economy in 1955 focused on civilian spending on automobiles and housing. In 1956, these two expenditures decreased, but business capital expenditure increased, playing a supporting role. In 1957, it seems that it will rely on more government spending to maintain it. Herbert Stein had already predicted in the London "Financial Times" on January 1, 1957, that the US government would increase its expenditures for 1957-58 to make up for the decline in the increase in business capital expenditure in 1957. Public works expenditures are also increasing in the budgets of the federal, state, and local governments in the United States. It is especially worth noting that military spending accounts for more than 60% of the federal budget. The continued increase in this part of spending, as well as the important role of military orders and military engineering construction in the current US economy, explains why the US arms expansion and war preparation policy is supported by US monopoly capital.
    However, the increase in government spending is ultimately limited. Whether it is appropriate for the government to shoulder such a burden and what the advantages and disadvantages are is currently a public debate in the US ruling group. US Treasury Secretary Humphrey opposed further increases in the federal government budget and advocated that the 1957-58 budget should be cut. He believes that the increase in government spending will either rely on borrowing, leading to inflation, or rely on tax increases, thereby reducing the purchasing power of the vast majority of consumers and shrinking the market. The faction represented by the US President's Council of Economic Advisers believes that the government's policy should be flexible and increase or decrease government spending and loosen or tighten the currency depending on the needs of the economic situation. Eisenhower was relatively inclined to Humphrey's views in the past, but in the 1957 economic report, he expressed the latter view. His change of opinion and his disagreement with Humphrey show that the current situation has forced the US government to enter the economic field more to try to solve the difficulties, but a part of the US ruling class has no confidence in this approach and strongly opposes it.
    There is no doubt that the difficulties that exist in the current US economy are actually a reflection of fundamental economic problems, and cannot be solved by government spending alone.
    (VII) Prospects for 1957
    The US government, as well as the business community and the bourgeois press, generally estimate that 1957 will roughly stagnate at the 1956 level, and it is impossible to expect the kind of "prosperity" as in 1955 and 1956. Some people also estimate that it can be expected to reach a slightly higher level than 1956, but it seems that more people estimate that there will be a more significant decline in the second half of the year. Even if the overall situation for the whole year is close to 1956, it will bring a downward trend.
    There is no material yet showing that several major factors supporting the US economy in the past two years will have a significant decline. Therefore, if there are no other changes, the above-mentioned estimates seem to be close to the facts. Due to insufficient materials at hand, it is difficult for us to make a more specific estimate of the US economy in 1957. Generally speaking, judging from the above-mentioned situations, the foundation of the US economic rise in 1955-56 was unstable and unhealthy, and 1957 is obviously facing increasing difficulties. It is precisely because of the increase in difficulties and the trend of the situation towards seriousness that US monopoly capital has to demand that the government use more of the government's functions to find a way out. We cannot underestimate the functions of the government in capitalist society. To a certain extent, it can delay the arrival of economic crises or appropriately reduce the impact of the crisis forces. However, no matter how much government spending is expanded and monetary policies are flexibly used, it cannot solve the contradiction between productivity and consumption that has already been sharpened in the United States. This contradiction will be the main content of the US economy in 1957 and will be further unfolded.

    美国经济情况
    ——从1956到1957——
    纪隆
    （一）1956年继续上升
    从下列1954—56三年的一些数字可以看出1956年的美国经济是继续上升的。
    		  1956　1955　1954
  国民生产总值　4，120　3，909　3，607
    （亿美元）
  工业生产指数　143　139　125
    （1947—1949＝100）
  企业资本支出　350　287　268
    （亿美元）
  个人收入　3，250　3，061　2，873
    （亿美元）
  就业人数　64，988　63，193　61，238
    （千人）
  失业人数　2，386　2，654　3，230
    （千人）
  百货商店零售　124　119　111
  指数（1947—1949＝100）
    1956年不仅是年度数字的上升，就全年各月数字来看，也是后期高于前期，表示在年度中的趋势也是上升的。例如，1956年12月的国民生产总值年率达到四千二百亿美元以上，12月的工业生产指数是一百四十七，都比同年以前各月数字为高。
    造成1956年美国经济继续上升的一个突出的因素是企业资本支出的增加。美国企业资本支出1955年较1954年增加十九亿美元，1956年则较1955年增加六十三亿美元。如果拿同一年的资本支出的增加同国民生产总值的增加相比，1955年为6.3％，1956年为30％，更显得1956年资本支出的增加数额是相当可观的。1956年资本支出金额较大、增加较多的，是汽车、钢铁、有色金属冶炼、机器制造、化学、造纸等工业，都是销路较好、或竞争激烈、或技术需要革新的企业。
    另一个支持1956年美国经济继续上升的重要因素是建筑业的活跃。1956年美国全年新建公私建筑价值约为四百四十二亿美元（较1955年增加十二亿美元），相当于国民生产总值10％以上，它对于美国经济的支持作用是很明显的。大量的企业资本支出、政府建筑和公共工程，人口的增加和移动，住宅的需要长期没有得到满足，等等，构成了1956年建筑继续上升的基本因素。
    分析1956年美国经济继续上升的因素时，还应该注意到美国政府开支的作用。美国政府开支，1954—55年度决算为六百四十六亿美元，1955—56年度预算为六百六十五亿美元，1956—57年度预算为六百八十九亿美元，每年都有增加；政府开支的数目平均相当于各年国民生产总值18％左右。据估计，目前美国联邦、州和地方各级政府全年开支约有一千亿美元，将近1956年全年国民生产总值的四分之一。这样数额庞大并且继续增加的政府支出，特别是有关军事订货和公共工程的支出，对于美国经济的刺激和支持作用是十分重要的。
    （二）上升中的阴暗面
    1956年美国经济虽然总的说来是继续上升，但是在这一年的上升中同时也存在着阴暗的一面。
    一、全年经济情况不是稳定的全期上升，而是有起伏升降的现象。例如，经过季节调整以后的全年各月工业生产指数和百货商店零售指数都反映了这样的情况。
    工业生				　百货商店
    产指数　				  零售指数
    （1947－1949＝（1947－1949＝100）		　100）
  1955年　12月　144　123
  1956年　1月　143　124
    2月　143　118
    3月　141　122
    4月　143　122
    5月　141　122
    6月　141　124
    7月　136　128
    8月　142　128
    9月　145　129
    10月　146　122
    11月　147　131

    1956年股票市场也有起落波动。1月下旬、2月中旬、5月下旬、10月上旬和11月下旬，都曾经有过大升大跌。一般都认为这是美国经济情况不稳的反映。
    二、上升不是全面的，而是各经济部门升降不一，不平衡的。例如，机器制造业是上升的，纺织衣着业和煤矿业则基本上是疲弱下降。建筑业总的说来是上升的，但是住宅建筑则是下降的。汽车全年生产六百六十五万辆，较1955年减少约二百二十八万辆。钢全年生产一亿一千五百万吨，较1955年减少二百万吨。
    三、近年来对美国经济起着支持作用的几个重要因素都呈现了衰退的征象。在1955年对美国经济的上升起着显著的支持作用的汽车工业1956年较1955年减产约26％。住宅建筑有明显的下跌：1955年住宅建筑新建约一百三十二万八千所，1956年下跌到一百一十二万所左右。作为支持1956年美国经济上升的突出因素企业资本支出，如果按全年各季数字计算年率加以比较，它的增加率也是逐渐下降的。据1956年12月15日美国“商业周刊”和1957年1月1日伦敦金融时报的报道，许多重要企业在1956年所拟定的1957年资本支出计划也表明在资本支出的增加率将要继续放慢，也就是增加的趋势转弱。
    四、国民生产总值的增加率下降。1955年国民生产总值约比1954年增加8.4％，1956年国民生产总值比1955年仅增加5.5％。而且，1956年物价上涨远比1955年多，连美国商务部也承认1956年国民生产总值“增加中的大约一半是由于物价的上涨”，因此，实际的增加更少。
    五、某些支持上升的重要因素是依靠空前的大量贷款。汽车和耐用消费品依赖消费者信用贷款；住宅建筑依赖抵押债款；企业增建厂房设备和添购原料和商品存货依赖商业贷款提供资金。这些贷款的飞速上升和达到空前的巨大数字，同汽车等耐用消费品的大量销售、建筑的繁盛和企业资本支出的高涨是密切联系着的。据美国总统经济顾问会议统计，1956年美国私人债务增加三百五十亿美元，相当于全年企业资本支出的总数。据1956年12月21日 “美国新闻与世界报道”估计，美国全国私人债务约达一千三百七十亿美元，其中住宅抵押债款九百五十亿美元，汽车及其它分期付款债务三百二十亿美元，百货商店赊账四十亿美元，其它私人债务六十亿美元。这些贷款对于当前美国经济的重要性是十分明显的。
    （三）1957年来势不妙
    上述的阴暗一面在进入1957年以后显然仍在继续发展，因此，1957年刚开始经济方面就出现了许多不可乐观的现象：
    一、企业资本支出减少。1956年美国企业资本支出较1955年增加六十三亿美元，即增加22％；据美国麦克格劳—希尔印刷公司年底年初的调查，1957年美国企业资本支出的计划约为三百九十亿美元，较1956年增加四十亿美元，即增加11％。1957年的增加，比1956年已经显著减少。但是，1957年开始不久，美国企业对于本年度的资本支出计划又作了缩减。据最近估计，1957年企业资本支出总数将降低到三百六十亿到三百七十亿美元，也就是较1956年将增加十亿到二十亿美元，这实际上将相当于物价上涨所造成的增加。因而，实际上1957年将只维持在1956年的水平。今年1月间，美国通用汽车公司宣布延迟两个新的装配厂的工程，美国通用电气公司决定延迟四项建设工程。这些垄断资本企业在年初相继收缩资本支出的行动，是极其值得注意的动向。
    二、住宅建筑进一步衰落。据美国全国住宅建筑业协会在1956年估计，1957年住宅新建筑约为一百一十二万所，较1955年下降16％；今年刚开始不久，情况就较原估计更为恶化，估计1957年新建住宅建筑将比原估计再减少20％，仅有九十万所左右。如果1957年企业资本支出有较大的缩减，整个建筑部门势将有更大的下降。同建筑有密切关系的冰箱、电视机、洗衣机、家具等业也已经同时呈现了黯淡的局面。
    三、汽车销路不佳。原来估计的汽车销路比较乐观，1957年可望销售小汽车六百五十万辆，汽车总的销售量可望达到七百万辆以上；但是，1957年最初一两个月的情况并不如理想那么好，现在估计小汽车销售量将在六百万辆以内，全年汽车总销售量将大致同1956年相近，难望有多大的上升。据1955年的估计，美国汽车工业使用全国钢20％，生橡胶65％，玻璃板70％，可辗铁60％，家具用皮革68％，镍23％，铅25％，铜12％，铝10％。汽车销路不能上升，对于有关各业的影响是不能忽视的。
    四、工业订货减少。首先在一向标志工业升降动向的炼钢业和工作母机制造业中出现了订货显著减少的情况。据估计，订货还要继续减少。某些品种的钢品不久将会出现供过于求的情况。工作母机制造业则是沿着1956年各季的趋势继续下降。当1956年企业资本支出高涨的时候，工作母机制造业订货已经下降，预示了1957年资本支出减少的趋势，而1957年企业资本支出的进一步减缩则意味着整个工业的前途将是指向下降的。
    五、股票市场不稳。纽约股票市场在2月份两次大跌。据推测说，是受前总统胡佛关于当前美国经济前途的悲观看法的影响。也有的说是由于1956年若干大企业利润率下降（例如，通用汽车公司，福特汽车公司，美国钢铁公司，孟山都化学公司等）。也有的说是由于市场利率高、银根紧。显然，股票市场这样的动荡，决不是上述的任何一个简单的原因所能解释。这种动荡在一定意义上是1957年美国经济前途不稳的反映。
    （四）生产力和消费力的矛盾
    上述的现象是多样的，表面的。归纳起来，还是生产力和消费力的矛盾问题，简单地说，就是商品的销路问题。汽车销路下降，住宅建筑衰落，都是这个问题；企业资本支出的下降，也是这个问题，因为如果销路不断扩大，企业就必然要进行资本支出来增加生产力，进行扩大再生产，如果销路成了问题，企业自然不会不断进行资本支出来增加生产力。
    今天在美国，存在着商品销路困难的问题。以非耐用消费品的纺织衣着业为例，1954年的生产还停留在1947—1949年的水平，1955年上升9％，1956年又停滞不前。据1956年的调查，虽然人口有了增加，但是1955年美国男子成套的正式服装销售量却减少了，女子的正式成套服装也从平均每人每三年买一套下降到平均每人每四年买一套。从纺织业使用的纤维量也可以看出美国纺织衣着业的销路的不景气——1942年纺织业使用纤维量六十九亿磅，1950年六十八亿磅，1955年六十七亿磅。
    耐用消费品的销路问题，从洗衣机、电视机、冰箱、汽车等销路下跌、生产减缩可以看出。这里需要特别指出的，是这些耐用消费品以及住宅建筑近年销路曾经有显著的上升，目前仍然能够维持相当的生产和销售水平。这并不是市场上有充分的购买力，而是主要地依靠各种贷款。以汽车为例，1950年以前，美国小汽车的新车销售就有40％—50％是分期付款赊购的，1955年赊购的小汽车增加到60％以上，1956年8、9月间竟增加到80％以上，即新的小汽车的销售，每五辆中至少有四辆是分期付款赊购的。据估计，美国全国五千五百万个家庭和其它“支出单位”中有六百六十万个单位要拿20％以上的扣除纳税后的收入偿付分期付款债务，它们占全部“支出单位”总数的12％。
    很清楚，当前美国经济中根本存在着生产力和消费力的严重矛盾，许多商品销路呆滞或下降，另一部分商品则是依靠贷款办法，寅吃卯粮，预支购买力来争取销售。这种预支购买力的办法可以起相当作用，但是终究是有限度的，作用也将递减。美国私人债务在1956年虽然继续增加，但是增加率比起1955年已经下降。以消费者信用贷款为例，1955年平均每月增加五亿美元，1956年已降为平均每月增加一点五亿美元。显然靠贷款等预支购买力的办法来维持和扩大销售的办法是不能持久的，1956年汽车和住宅建筑的下降就是最好的说明。
    由于商品销路成问题，美国工业一向是开工不足。尽管如此，近几年来美国企业却在进行大规模的资本支出，也就是在扩大生产力。这就只有使生产力和消费力的矛盾更加尖锐起来。以汽车工业为例，1956年共生产汽车六百六十五万辆，但是据估计1956年美国汽车工业的生产力却达到一千万辆，还有一部分扩建工程在1957年还要继续进行。显然，在销路不能增加的情况下进行大量资本支出来扩大生产力，是不能持久的，而且只会使以后的销路问题更加严重。但是，激烈的竞争又迫使许多工业加紧资本支出，企图以新技术、新产品和低成本来争夺市场，结果商品的总的销售情况就只有更加困难。
    （五）通货膨胀和头寸紧张
    各种贷款不断增加和资本支出继续进行，需要大量的资金。如果充分供应这方面的资金，结果将会很快地发展成为严重的通货膨胀。美国金融当局到现在为止是坚持遏制通货膨胀的政策，采用提高利率和贴现率、出售证券、扣紧贷款条件、控制通货流通量等办法。但是，在政府不断增加开支和巨额信用的不断冲击下，要想长期制止通货膨胀是不可能的。1956年物价呈现了近几年所未有的上涨。按照美国劳工部劳工统计局的批发物价指数（1947－1949＝100），1955年12月为111.3，1956年12月为116.2，上涨约4.4％。据估计，1957年还要上涨5％。这个已经出现的通货膨胀实际上就是近两年美国经济“繁荣”的后果。照目前物价上涨、物资供应、货币流通量和速度看，情况还不算严重。但是，各方面不断强调严重的通货膨胀的威胁，表明了如果继续依赖信用膨胀来支撑像1955年和1956年的经济上升，后果将是十分严重的。
    事实上，目前美国经济还并不仅仅面对着通货膨胀的威胁。美国工商界有人认为，真正可怕的还是通货紧缩的危害。为了筹措各种贷款和资本支出的资金，工商企业和金融界增发股票债券、动用盈余、出售库存证券、提高存款利率、减低准备，到了1956年下半年已经近乎“竭泽而渔”的境地。银行的流动资产率降低，资产“构成”起了变化，商业银行放款几乎已经到了限度，市面普遍存在资金不够、头寸紧张的现象。除银行和保险公司以外的所有美国公司的流动资产对流动负债的比率，在1955年9月30日为53.5％，到1956年9月30日已经降为46.2％。在这种情况下，赊购、抵押和一般购买减少，企业缩减存货和扩建，是必然的。1957年企业资本支出缩减和汽车销路不佳、住宅建筑下降，就是在这种情况下出现的。
    究竟应当采取收缩通货政策来遏制物价上涨，还是应当放松信用来避免通货紧缩的危害，从1956年到1957年始终是美国国内争论不休、至今没有能解决的问题。这个争论反映了今天美国经济的困难局面，而这种局面根本不是仅仅通货政策所能解决的。艾森豪威尔在1956年竞选时就曾经多次提到要制止通货膨胀，但是通货膨胀却在继续发展，正是由于这并不是一个通货的技术问题，而是牵涉很广的大问题。
    （六）庞大的政府开支
    用预支消费者的购买力和扩大资本支出来支持市场是解决不了问题的，而且已经产生严重的困难，已如上述。能不能向外输出，开拓国外市场呢？最大的问题是资本主义世界的国际市场对于美国商品也缺乏购买力——美元荒；社会主义的国际市场则由于美国在贸易方面的各种限制而对美国商品不起多大作用。美国至今还采取限制进口和高关税的办法保护本国商品在国内市场的销售，因此立即大量增加进口来换取商品出口，是有困难的。
    目前美国统治集团所唯一寄托希望并且在继续加强依赖的办法是通过扩大政府开支来维持市场、刺激生产。1957—1958年度的联邦预算草案是美国有史以来和平时期的最大预算。据华尔街日报乔治·席艾指出，这个预算的收支都是净数，实际上这个预算按收支毛额计算要收入九百九十亿美元，付出九百六十亿美元，相当于按照1956年第三季度的国民生产总值年率四千一百四十亿美元的四分之一左右，超过了1953年朝鲜战争时期最高峰时的比数。他举出几年的预算支付毛额同国民生产总值的百分比是很有意思的：
  1929—33　	8％—14％
  1941　	20％
  1950		14％
  1953　	23％
  1956（按第三季度总值）　19％
  1957（按1956年第三季度总值）　24％即使按照目前估计的1957年国民生产总值四千三百五十亿美元计算，比率也等于1953年朝鲜战争最高峰时期——23％。美国政府愈来愈多地作为最大的顾主进入美国的市场，几乎已经成为不可避免的前途。1957年1月20日“纽约时报”上赫伯特·柯谢兹指出，美国经济在1955年着重依靠平民对汽车和住宅的支出，1956年这两项支出减少，但是企业资本支出增加，起了支持作用，1957年似乎将依赖以更多的政府支出来维持。赫伯脱·斯坦因早在1957年1月1日就在伦敦“金融时报”上预言，美国政府将要增加1957—58年度的支出以弥补1957年企业资本支出增加的下降。公共工程支出在美国的联邦、州和地方政府的预算中也正在日益增加。尤其值得注意的是联邦预算中占60％以上的军事开支。这部分开支的继续增加以及其中军事订货、军事工程建设等对于目前美国经济的重要作用，说明了美国的扩军备战政策为什么得到美国垄断资本的支持。
    但是，政府开支的增加终究是有限度的，究竟由政府挑起这样的担子是否合适，利害如何，目前在美国统治集团中有着公开的争论。美国财政部长汉弗莱反对联邦政府预算再有增加，并且主张1957—58年度预算应当削减。他认为政府支出增加，其结果不是依靠举债、造成通货膨胀，就是依靠加税、从而减少广大消费者的购买力，缩小了市场。以美国总统经济顾问会议为代表的一派则认为政府的政策应当是机动灵活的，看经济情况需要来增减政府开支，放松或收缩通货。艾森豪威尔过去是比较倾向于汉弗莱的主张的，但是在1957年的经济报告中他表示了后一种看法。他的意见的改变和他同汉弗莱的分歧，表明了当前的形势已经迫使美国政府不得不更多地进入经济领域来设法解决困难，而对于这样的做法美国统治阶级中有一部分人是没有信心的，强烈反对的。
    毫无疑问，当前美国经济中所存在的困难，实际上是根本性的经济问题的反映，仅靠政府的开支并不能求得解决。
    （七）1957年前景
    美国政府方面，以及工商界和资产阶级报刊，一般地估计1957年大致上将是停滞在1956年水平，不可能期望像1955年和1956年那样的“繁荣”。也有人估计可望达到较1956年略高的水平，但是似乎更多的人估计下半年将有较显著的下降，即使全年总的情况接近1956年，但是带来的却是下降的趋势。
    现在还没有看到任何材料表明这两年支持美国经济的几个主要因素将有巨大的下跌，因此，如果没有其它的变化，上述的估计看来是接近事实的。由于手头材料不够，我们还难于就1957年的美国经济作出更具体的估计。总的说来，从上述的一些情况来看，1955—56年美国经济上升的基础是不稳固的、不健康的，1957年显然正在面对着日益增加的困难。正是由于困难增加，形势趋向严重，美国垄断资本不得不要求政府更多地运用政府的功能来找寻出路。我们对资本主义社会中政府的功能不能低估，在一定程度上它可以推迟经济危机的到来，或适当地减轻危机的冲击力量，但是不管怎样扩大政府开支、灵活运用通货政策，都解决不了美国当前已经尖锐化的生产力和消费力之间的矛盾，这个矛盾将是1957年美国经济中的主要内容，并且要进一步展开。
