    British North Borneo Arms
    Smuggled Continuously to Sulawesi
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 17th. According to the Indonesian news agency Antara on March 16th, quoting reports from the Balikpapan newspaper, organized arms smuggling groups have recently been smuggling large quantities of rifles, ammunition and other types of light weapons from British North Borneo to Sulawesi, Indonesia.

    The smuggling group ships copra from Sulawesi to Tawau for sale, and then buys weapons from there in return. Newspaper reports say this illegal copra-arms trade is carried out with the tacit consent of the British authorities in Tawau.
