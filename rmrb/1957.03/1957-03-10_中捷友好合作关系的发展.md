    The friendly and cooperative relations between China and Czechoslovakia in various fields have developed greatly in recent years.
    In the past few years, leaders of China and Czechoslovakia have made many friendly visits, enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the two countries. Vice Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Ulanhu, and the delegation of the National People's Congress led by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen have all visited Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovak Vice Premiers Kopecký and Jankovcova have also visited China.
    In terms of economic cooperation, the two countries have signed more than 40 agreements and protocols related to economic matters in recent years. The trade volume between the two countries is also increasing year by year. Czechoslovakia has supplied China with many machines and complete sets of equipment, such as 3,000-ton hydraulic presses, giant lathes, precision instruments, transportation equipment, and power station equipment, as well as complete sets of equipment for chemical fertilizer, sugar refining, film processing, and chemical factories. China has also supplied Czechoslovakia with various mineral products and agricultural products it needs. The Czechoslovak government also donated a complete set of agricultural machinery equipment to a state-owned farm in China (the China-Czechoslovakia Friendship Farm). In addition, with the help of Czechoslovak experts, China successfully trial-produced a 6,000-kilowatt generator.
    In terms of cultural cooperation, the two countries signed a cultural and technical cooperation agreement in May 1952. As of October 1956, China had sent more than 50 cultural delegations and representatives, totaling more than 1,000 people, to visit Czechoslovakia; during this period, Czechoslovakia sent more than 40 delegations, totaling more than 600 people, to visit China at China's invitation. In addition, the two countries have also exchanged many students, established language classes to learn each other's national languages, and sent teachers to teach in each other's countries. By the end of 1955, China had translated and published 58 Czechoslovak books. Among them, "Report from the Gallows" by Czechoslovak national hero Julius Fučík has been published thirteen times in Chinese, Mongolian, and Korean, with sales reaching 735,000 copies. Eleven national theater troupes in China have performed Czechoslovak plays such as "Julius Fučík" and "The Fairy Flute". The Czechoslovak side has also staged seven Chinese plays, such as "The White-Haired Girl," "Qu Yuan," and "Li Chuang Wang." In order to introduce the achievements of Czechoslovakia's socialist construction and the happy life of the people, China has held 19 Czechoslovak exhibitions and screened 23 Czechoslovak films, with audiences reaching 50 million. In addition, the two countries jointly produced four films: "Kangzang Highway," "People United as One," "Flowers of Friendship Everywhere," and "Spring in China."
