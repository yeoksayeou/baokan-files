　　A Quartermaster from a Certain Unit of the People's Liberation Army Cultivates a New Breed of Pig
　　Large Frame, Easy to Feed, and Grows an Average of 1.2 Kilograms of Meat Per Day
    Our Newspaper reports: Our Newspaper reporter Lian Yunshan reports: Twelve new breed pigs produced by crossing "Yorkshire" pigs (commonly known as white pigs) with Hunan pigs by a certain unit of the Wuhan Military Region of the People's Liberation Army have grown to a minimum of 200 kilograms and a maximum of 300 kilograms in 375 days, averaging 1.2 kilograms of meat gain per day. Comrade Su Guifa, the quartermaster of the aforementioned unit of the Wuhan Military Region who cultivated this new breed of pig, is currently attending the active elements conference of the General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army in Beijing.
    Comrade Su Guifa said: "Yorkshire" pigs have a large frame and grow quickly, but they require more concentrated feed. Hunan pigs have thin skin, fine meat, and grow quickly, and require coarser feed, but the disadvantage is that they have a small frame and do not grow quickly. The new breed of pigs produced by crossing "Yorkshire" pigs with pigs from Mengyun City, Hunan, combines the advantages of these two breeds: large frame, easy to feed, grows very quickly, and adapts to the Chinese climate. It is estimated that after two years of breeding, each pig can weigh more than 500 kilograms.
    The feed they use for these pigs is approximately 65% lake grass, 30% rice bran, and 5% bone meal or eggshell powder. The pig feed should be boiled until soft, like a porridge. Feed hot food in winter, at a temperature that is not too hot to touch with your hand. Feed cool food in summer. Large, medium, and small pigs are fed separately. In terms of management, the pigsty must be dry, hygienic, and have sufficient sunlight. The sty is divided into three areas for sleeping, defecation, and eating. With a little training, the pigs can get used to it. The feed for breeding sows should be given special attention. The lactation period for sows should be two months, as weaning too early will affect development.
    Comrade Su Guifa is now summarizing the breeding and feeding methods for this new breed of pig. The General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army plans to first promote it appropriately among troops stationed in the southern regions.

　　解放军某部事务长培育出一种新品种猪
　　架子大、好喂养，平均每天长肉一斤四两
    本报讯　本报记者连云山报道：解放军武汉军区某部用“约克夏”猪种（俗称白猪）和湖南猪交配所产生的十二头新品种猪，在三百七十五天内，最小的已长到四百斤，最大的重六百斤，平均每天长肉一斤四两。培育这种新种猪的武汉军区某部事务长苏贵发同志，现正在北京出席解放军总后勤部积极分子大会。
    苏贵发同志说：“约克夏”种猪身架大，长的快，但它需要较多的精饲料喂养。湖南猪种皮薄、肉细、长的快，需要的饲料较粗，但缺点是架子小、长不快。“约克夏”猪种和湖南孟云市的猪交配，生出的新种猪集中了这两种猪的优点：架子大，好饲养，长肉很快，又适应我国气候。据估计：饲养两年，每头可重一千多斤。
    他们饲养这种猪用的饲料是：湖草占65％左右，谷糠占30％，另外喂5％左右的骨粉或蛋壳粉。猪食要煮烂，成稀饭状。冬天喂热食，以插手不烫为宜。夏天喂凉食。大、中、小猪分别喂。管理方面，猪圈须干燥、卫生、阳光充足。圈内分成猪睡觉、粪便、吃食三处地方，对猪稍加调教就可习惯。对生产的母猪在饲料上要有所照顾。母猪给小猪喂奶期以两个月为宜，过早断奶影响发育。
    现在苏贵发同志正在总结这种新品种猪的培育和饲养办法，解放军总后勤部准备首先在驻南方地区的部队中适当推广。
