He said, "The masses at this small airport represent the entire Khmer people; they want to express warm friendship to your country and to you." Prince Penn Nouth then spoke of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He said, "Your visit, as well as Premier Zhou Enlai's visit before yours, further proves that understanding is fully possible between peoples who have different ideologies but are inspired by the same desire for peace and the same desire to contribute to the maintenance of world peace."

Chairman of the Polish Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz replied that he brought the warm respect and sincere feelings of the Polish people and government to the Cambodian people and government. He also mentioned the presence of the International Commission in Cambodia and Prince Sihanouk's visit to Poland, which allowed the Polish people to become familiar with Cambodia.

The Polish government delegation was greeted by crowds along the way as they drove to the Royal Palace. The motorcade passed along roads decorated with Cambodian and Polish flags, as well as welcome banners in both Khmer and Polish.
