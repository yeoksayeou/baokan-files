Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, March 24th. A commemorative meeting for the fiftieth anniversary of the 1907 Romanian peasant uprising was held in Bucharest on the evening of the 23rd.

　　Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, Chivu Stoica, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and Anton Moisescu, Chairman of the National Assembly, attended the meeting.

　　More than a thousand people participated in the meeting, including over two hundred participants in the 1907 peasant uprising from all over the country. These veterans, in their seventies and eighties, were wearing new clothes and the commemorative medal for the 1907 peasant uprising.

　　Moisescu spoke at the meeting. He said that during the years of rule by landlords and capitalists, the people's lives were very difficult, which led to the peasant uprising in February and March of 1907. In this struggle for land, bread, and freedom, more than 11,000 peasants were killed. He said that now, Romania has eliminated the landlord class, workers and peasants have formed a solid alliance, and peasants have embarked on the road of collectivization. The lives of peasants have greatly improved.

　　Mi. Bujor, an activist in the workers' movement and a participant in the peasant uprising, described in detail at the meeting how the working class supported the peasant uprising at the time. F. Simidreanu, a peasant who participated in the uprising, reported on the heroic struggle of the peasants against the landlords and their troops.

　　After the meeting, a program about the peasant uprising was performed at the opera house.

　　Since February this year, commemorative activities for the peasant uprising have been carried out throughout Romania. Newspapers have continuously published a large number of commemorative articles and news about the commemorations. Cinemas screened the documentary "1907," which introduced the uprising.

    新华社布加勒斯特24日电　布加勒斯特23日晚间举行了1907年罗马尼亚农民起义五十周年纪念大会。
    罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会第一书记乔治乌—德治，部长会议主席斯托伊卡，国民议会主席帕伏列斯库都出席了大会。
    参加大会的共有一千多人，其中有来自全国各地的二百多名1907年农民起义的参加者。这些七八十岁的老人都穿着新装，胸前佩戴着1907年农民起义纪念章。
    帕伏列斯库在大会上讲了话。他说，在地主和资本家统治的年代中，人民的生活是很困难的，所以在1907年2、3月间发生了农民起义。在这次为争取土地、面包和自由的斗争中，有一万一千多农民被杀害。他说，现在，罗马尼亚已经消灭了地主阶级，工人和农民已经结成了坚固的联盟，农民走上了集体化的道路。农民的生活有了很大的改善。
    工人运动的活动家和农民起义的参加者米·布热尔在大会上详细地叙述了当时的工人阶级如何支持农民起义。参加起义的农民弗·西米得列亚报告了农民同地主和他们的军队英勇斗争的情形。
    会后，在歌剧院演出了有关农民起义的节目。
    今年2月份以来，罗马尼亚全国各地都进行了农民起义的纪念活动。报纸连续登载了大量的纪念文章和有关纪念的消息。电影院放映了介绍起义情况的文献纪录片“1907年”。
