　　Editing Recollections
　　——On the "Compendium of New Chinese Literature"
　　Zhao Jiabi
    After liberation, many people suggested reprinting the "Compendium of New Chinese Literature." I think a simple reprint of the original version is unnecessary; instead, the publishing house might consider the original unfulfilled plan—to publish "One Hundred Famous Literary Works Since the May Fourth Movement." Today's people's publishing industry no longer has the problem of infringement of rights between publishing houses; and today's readers may not be satisfied with reading selections like the "Compendium of New Chinese Literature," but want to see the complete originals published in the "May Fourth" era. The number of pre-Liberation literary works currently published is too small, and limited to only a few famous writers. According to Comrade A Ying's statistics, in the first decade, approximately 99 literary works, 107 novels, 42 essays, 21 plays, 82 poems, and 13 collections of creative works were published. If we could select fifty or one hundred of these to compile into a collection, as long as the works have played a certain role in the development of new Chinese literature and are relatively excellent, they can be considered for inclusion. This would be very helpful for readers to understand the literature of the "May Fourth" era.
      After the publication of the first decade of the "Compendium of New Chinese Literature," the Liangyou Editorial Department also considered the publication plan for the second period, "From the Northern Expedition to the Present." However, the August 13th Incident occurred, and the Liangyou Book Company was severely damaged by the Japanese imperialist fire, so this matter was out of the question.
    During the Anti-Japanese War, Liangyou first moved to Guilin and then to Chongqing. In the autumn of 1945, given that the defeat of Japanese imperialism was only a matter of time, I talked with several leading comrades of the National Literary Association about continuing the "Compendium of New Chinese Literature" for the third period, the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. We planned to publish it after Liangyou moved back to Shanghai, and then go back to compile the second period, "From the Northern Expedition to the Anti-Japanese War." The materials from the Anti-Japanese War period, whether in Yan'an, Chongqing, or Guilin, were all printed on rough paper, which was difficult to preserve for a long time; and more were lost due to the chaos of war. In order to act while the materials were still on hand and summarize the literary creation activities during the Anti-Japanese War, we immediately obtained the support of writers, and after a short period of deliberation, we agreed on seven compilers. The Liangyou Editorial Department would uniformly collect and provide the materials. Mr. Guo Moruo would compile the theoretical collection; Mr. Mao Dun would compile the novel collection; Mr. Lao She would compile the reportage collection; Mr. Ye Shengtao would compile the essay collection; Mr. Hong Shen would compile the drama collection in two volumes; and Mr. Wen Yiduo was originally invited to compile the poetry collection, but later it was changed to Mr. Li Guangtian. I remember that after all the compilers were appointed, we had a small gathering at a small restaurant in Zengjiayan, Chongqing, and signed the contract agreements. Unfortunately, after the victory, the Liangyou Company, which moved back to Shanghai, had internal shareholder disputes and was virtually closed down, and this plan was also aborted. However, I still keep the contract agreements signed by the compilers and the list of materials as souvenirs. Mr. Mao Dun had already given me the preliminary catalog of the "Novel Collection," divided into five categories, with thirty-five articles selected; according to the catalog, I tore down the selected works from the rough paper books and organized a large package of original manuscripts, which also followed me from Chongqing back to Shanghai and has been sleeping in the bookcase for ten years. Reading late at night in the quiet of the night, I occasionally touch the ten-volume "Compendium of New Chinese Literature," and then look at the souvenirs left more than ten years ago, and cannot help but think of the enthusiastic support and cooperation of the senior writers at that time; I think of the imperialist wars of aggression, the Kuomintang's heavy obstruction, the life-and-death competition between private publishing houses, and the internal power struggles within private publishing houses in the old society. In such a society, how much of an editor's beautiful ideals can be realized smoothly without being destroyed?

　　——关于中国新文学大系
　　赵家璧
    解放后，很多人建议把“中国新文学大系”重印。我认为原版重印，似无必要；倒是当时第一个未完成的计划——出版“五四以来文学名著百种”，有关出版社不妨考虑。今天的人民出版事业，已不再存在什么出版社间权益侵害与否的问题了；而今天的读者可能还不满足于读像“中国新文学大系”那样的选集，而要求看看“五四”时代出版的完整的原本。目前已出版的建国前的文学作品为数太少，而且仅限于极少数著名的作家。根据阿英同志的统计，第一个十年间出版的文学论著约有九十九种，小说一百零七种，散文四十二种，戏剧二十一种，诗八十二种，创作总集十三种。如能从中精选五十或一百种编成一套文库，只要对中国新文学建设事业曾起过一定作用而比较优秀的作品都可以考虑编入，这对读者了解“五四”时代的文学还是大有用处的。
      “中国新文学大系”第一期第一个十年出版后，良友编辑部也曾考虑过“‘北伐’到‘现在’”的第二期的出版计划。但是八·一三战事发生，良友图书公司在日本帝国主义的炮火下惨遭破坏，此事也就无从谈起了。
    抗战时期，良友先迁桂林，后移重庆。1945年秋，鉴于日本帝国主义的失败只是时间问题，便和全国文协的几位领导同志们谈起了续编“中国新文学大系”第三期抗战八年的计划，准备良友迁回上海后出版，将来再回头编第二期“北伐到抗战”。抗战时期的材料，不论延安、重庆、桂林等地，都是土纸印的，很难长久保存；而兵荒马乱，散失更多。为了趁材料都在手头时先行动手，替抗战期间的文学创作活动做个总结，所以立刻获得作家们的支持，经过短期的酝酿，就约定了七位编选人，资料由良友编辑部统一搜集供给。理论集由郭沫若先生编选；小说集由茅盾先生编选；报告文学集由老舍先生编选；散文集由叶圣陶先生编选；戏剧集分上下两卷，由洪深先生编选；诗集原请闻一多先生后改由李广田先生编选。我记得编选人全部约定后，曾在重庆曾家岩的一个小馆子里一起小叙了一次，并且把约稿合同都签订了。可惜胜利后，迁回上海的良友公司股东内部发生了纠纷，无形停业，这个计划也告流产。但是我至今还把编选人亲笔签名的约稿合同和资料目录当纪念品珍藏着。茅盾先生当时已把“小说集”的初步目录给了我，内分五类，入选三十五篇；我根据目录从土纸书上把入选作品撕下来整理好了的一大包原稿，也跟我从重庆回到上海，十年来一直睡在书橱里。灯下读书到夜深人静时，偶尔抚摸着十卷本的“中国新文学大系”，再看看那些十多年前留下的纪念品，不禁想起当时前辈作家们热情的支持和合作；想起旧社会里，帝国主义的侵略战争，国民党的重重阻挠，私营出版社间你死我活的竞争，以及私营出版社内部争权夺利的矛盾。在那样一个社会里，一个编辑的美好理想，能有多少部分不遭到破坏而顺利实现的呢？
