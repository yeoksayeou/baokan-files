Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, March 11th: The famous Dujiangyan irrigation project has ended its annual maintenance and released water for irrigation early on March 10th.

It is the first time in the 2,200-year history of Dujiangyan that the water release date has been advanced to March 10th. Last year, Dujiangyan released water on March 27th. In previous years, the water release date was around the Qingming Festival in the lunar calendar (i.e., early April).

The early water release from Dujiangyan strongly supports the agricultural cooperatives in its irrigation area – the Western Sichuan Plain – in significantly increasing the planting area of double-season rice this year. According to the plan, the agricultural cooperatives in the Western Sichuan Plain will plant more than 700,000 mu of double-season rice this year (a six-fold increase compared to last year), which is estimated to increase rice production by more than 100 million jin. Dujiangyan's water release at this time can fully meet the water needs of agricultural cooperatives in the irrigation area for planting early rice in mid-March.

In the past two or three years, the Dujiangyan management organization has successively built some permanent control gates and other permanent or semi-permanent projects on the main canals and some water diversion and intake points of Dujiangyan (in the past, Dujiangyan was entirely composed of temporary projects, which required annual maintenance). At the same time, the annual maintenance plan was rationally arranged last year, which greatly shortened the maintenance time this year, making it possible to release water much earlier.

Before liberation in 1949, Dujiangyan's irrigation area was only more than 3.3 million mu. After more than seven years of management since liberation, this year's irrigation area can be expanded to more than 5.6 million mu.

The entire canal is more than 350 kilometers long, and it is expected to irrigate more than 570,000 mu of farmland after its completion this spring. Currently, tens of thousands of laborers are participating in the construction of the canal project every day. Gan Hongguang (Draft from Sichuan Daily)

### 都江堰提前放水灌田  及时支持川西平原播种双季早稻

    都江堰提前放水灌田
    及时支持川西平原播种双季早稻
    新华社成都11日电　著名的水利工程都江堰，结束了一年一度的岁修工程，已经提前在3月10日放水灌田。
    能够把放水的日期提前到3月10日，在这个已经有了两千两百多年历史的都江堰，还是第一次。都江堰去年是3月27日放水。过去多年的放水日期是旧历清明节前后（即4月上旬）。
    都江堰提前放水，有力地支持了它的灌溉区——川西平原上的农业社，今年大幅度地增加双季稻的种植面积。按照计划，川西平原的农业社今年将要种植七十多万亩双季稻（比去年增加六倍），估计可因此增产稻谷一亿多斤。都江堰在这时放水，完全可以满足灌区农业社在3月中旬播种早稻的用水需要。
    在过去的两三年中，都江堰的管理机构，陆续在都江堰的几条主要干渠上和一些分水、进水口上，修建一些永久性的控制闸和其他永久性或半永久性的工程（都江堰过去全部是临时性的工程，因而每年需要岁修）。同时，去年又合理地安排了岁修计划，因而大大地缩短了今年的岁修时间，能够大大地提前放水。
    都江堰在解放前1949年，灌溉面积只有三百三十多万亩。经过解放七年多来的整治，今年的灌溉面积可以扩大到五百六十多万亩。
