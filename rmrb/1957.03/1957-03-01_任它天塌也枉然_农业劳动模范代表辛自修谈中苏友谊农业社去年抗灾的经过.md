Let the Sky Fall, It's All in Vain
--Agricultural Labor Model Representative Xin Zixiu Talks About the Zhong-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Cooperative's Disaster Resistance Last Year

Xin Zixiu, the director of the Zhong-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in Lushan County, Henan Province, who is attending the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference, told reporters about the cooperative's experience in overcoming the extraordinary flood disaster last year, the worst in nearly a hundred years in the area. For a newly established cooperative, this flood was truly a severe test.

This cooperative was only established last spring by the merger of eleven local primary cooperatives and some individual farmers into an advanced cooperative. After its establishment, the cooperative set a goal of achieving an average annual grain yield of 450 jin per mu for the entire cooperative, and used this as a condition to participate in a production increase competition with the Jinxing Cooperative in Shanxi Province, as well as a competition with agricultural cooperatives throughout the province. In the spring, all cooperative members were enthusiastic about accumulating fertilizer and building water conservancy projects, and the early autumn planting was also very meticulous.

However, just as the wheat harvest was underway last year, with piles of wheat stalks towering in the threshing grounds next to the village, waiting to be threshed, and the cooperative members had just finished transplanting rice seedlings in the wheat stubble fields and sown the late autumn crops, torrential rains suddenly fell, and floods erupted from the Funiu Mountains. The water in the small river that ran through the cooperative's land rose sharply. Of the cooperative's 4,500 mu of autumn crops, more than 3,200 mu were flooded, including 1,200 mu of the best farmland, accounting for more than one-fifth of the cooperative's cultivated land, which was washed into sandy beaches. The Sageta village, near the river, with more than 80 households, was also flooded, and eight of the ten members of two cooperative households were washed away by the flood; more than seventy head of cattle and other livestock were drowned or washed away. This ruthless flood also destroyed the small reservoir that the cooperative members had just built in the spring, silted up most of the canals, washed away the water mill that had just been installed not long ago; countless wheat was washed away or rotted by the rain.

This was truly a rare and ferocious torrential rain and flash flood, and its enormous destructive power frightened many white-haired old men. They had not only never experienced it, but had never even heard their predecessors talk about such a large flood in the area.

After the flood subsided, a rough estimate by the cooperative showed that the property losses were truly staggering: just the 1,200 mu of land that had been washed into sandy beaches and could no longer be planted, plus the wheat that had been washed away or rotted, totaled more than 850,000 jin of grain; adding the casualties of people and animals, collapsed houses, and other land that had reduced production due to the disaster, it was simply impossible to estimate the extent of the losses.

However, this did not frighten Xin Zixiu and most of the cooperative members. On the night of the flash flood, when the river was still raging with terrifying waves, some Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members in the cooperative risked their lives and ran to the villages that had been hit the hardest to rescue livestock and property that had been washed away. Xin Zixiu and the secretary of the cooperative's CCP branch also personally went to the homes of the cooperative members who had been hit the hardest to ask them how they were doing and to help them solve their living difficulties. On that occasion, the cooperative member Wang Siwa heard the flood coming in his sleep in the dark of night, and in his haste to escape, he lost all the clothes on his body. After hearing about this, the cooperative cadres immediately decided to take money from the cooperative to make clothes for him. After the disaster, some cooperative members' confidence wavered: Could the agricultural cooperative continue to operate? What would life be like in the future? Some even planned to take their families and flee the famine. After such careful care from the cooperative, these cooperative members further realized the warmth of living in this big family, and their emotions gradually stabilized.

At that time, the serious task facing the cooperative was to quickly salvage and restore the cooperative's agricultural production. After the rain stopped, the entire cooperative immediately began draining water, replanting, and salvaging the autumn crops. At that time, the biggest difficulty was: how to replant the destroyed autumn crops? Most of the flooded land still had standing water, and it could not be plowed in a short period of time, but replanting late autumn crops could not be delayed any longer.

After summarizing the experience of drought-resistant planting in the summer of 1955, the cooperative solved the problem of replanting late autumn crops. In 1955, when it was still a primary cooperative, there was a drought after the wheat harvest, which delayed the time for planting late autumn crops. In the end, they adopted the method of planting without plowing the land. This time, they also decided to adopt this method, planting the seeds in the ground first. After the cooperative's arrangement and mobilization, all the female cooperative members bravely took on this task. They all took off their shoes and stood in the knee-deep mud, using a stick to make holes with one hand and planting seeds with the other. They worked from dawn until late at night every day. After several days of hard work, they finally replanted the seeds in the ground. At the same time, the male cooperative members were even busier. Some of them rushed to thresh the rain-soaked wheat, and most of them hurried to dig ditches to drain the water. It was almost impossible to find an idle person in the entire cooperative.

In this way, in just five days, the cooperative's more than 2,000 mu of autumn fields that had been washed away were completely replanted, and the more than 700 mu of early autumn crops and rice that could be salvaged were also straightened up, and 1.27 million sweet potato plants, 87 mu of vegetables, and 240 mu of soybeans were planted on the idle land such as the edges of villages and wasteland.

In order to strive for a good autumn harvest to make up for the losses, the cooperative immediately launched a campaign to eliminate weeds and increase topdressing fertilizer. Throughout the summer before the autumn harvest, the entire cooperative used the most labor to manage the autumn fields, completely eliminating the weeds in the autumn fields. At the same time, the entire cooperative tried every means to accumulate more than 10,000 carts (more than 1,000 jin per cart) of fertilizer and applied topdressing fertilizer to the autumn crops. In the later stage of corn growth, artificial auxiliary pollination of corn was also widely promoted to strive for a bumper corn harvest.

Last autumn, a miracle appeared in Lushan County. The Zhong-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Cooperative had a bumper harvest. This agricultural cooperative, which had suffered a severe flood disaster and whose production reduction seemed inevitable at the time, finally had a bumper harvest after a summer of collective labor, and finally achieved the production increase plan set in the spring. Last year, the result of the cooperative's autumn harvest, converted into the average yield of raw grain per mu of the cooperative's cultivated land, still reached 501 jin, an increase of more than 17% compared with the bumper harvest year of 1955. Last year, this cooperative attached great importance to sideline production due to the disaster, and as a result, the sideline income increased by more than two times compared with 1955, with a total income of more than 57,000 yuan. As a result of the distribution, the cooperative finally enabled more than 90% of the cooperative members to increase their income compared with 1955 after the flood disaster.

The fact that the Zhong-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Cooperative overcame the extraordinary flood disaster and won a bumper harvest deeply educated all the cooperative members. More than half a year ago, the Sageta village, which had been flooded with broken walls and ruins everywhere, now has newly built thatched houses and tiled houses connected in one piece; the 1,200 mu of fertile land that had been washed into sandy beaches by the flood has been actively excavated throughout the winter, and much of it has now reappeared. In the entire cooperative, just in Sageta village, there were more than 40 cooperative households who lost their original cultivated land before joining the cooperative due to last year's flood disaster, but last year they all received the remuneration they deserved according to their workdays, just like other farmers, and many of them became surplus grain households. Li Zhengxiang, a rich middle peasant in this village, used to like to praise his original 20 mu of rice fields, saying how fertile the rice fields were, saying that it was the best "life-saving land," and so on. Last year, a ruthless flood washed away his "life-saving land." Now he says to everyone he meets: "If it weren't for the agricultural cooperative, my family would have had to flee the famine! It seems that the 'life-saving land' is not as good as the 'life-saving cooperative' after all!"

The cooperative member Lei Zhihe, whose family of five had four members washed away by the flood, almost lost all his family property. However, after the autumn harvest last year, he received 800 jin of grain and 60 yuan, and not long ago he got married again and rebuilt a happy family.

Many cooperative members have deeply realized from the practice of the past year how great the power of agricultural cooperatives is in the struggle against natural disasters. They said with pride and confidence: "If you want to impoverish the Zhong-Soviet Friendship Cooperative, you don't have to be afraid even if the sky falls!"

    任它天塌也枉然
    ——农业劳动模范代表辛自修谈中苏友谊农业社去年抗灾的经过
    新华社记者  阚枫
    出席全国农业劳动模范代表会议的河南省鲁山县中苏友谊农业社主任辛自修，向记者叙述了去年这个社战胜当地近一百多年来所没有过的特大洪水灾害的经过。对于一个刚成立的新社，这场水灾真是严重的考验。
    这个社是去年春天才由当地十一个初级社和一部分个体农户联合建成的高级社。这个社建成以后，订了一个争取全社每亩平均年产粮食四百五十斤的计划，并且用这作条件参加了同山西省金星社进行的增产竞赛，也同全省农业社进行竞赛。一春天，全社社员积肥和兴修水利都很起劲，早秋播种也很精细。
    可是，正当去年麦收的时候，村边打麦场上高耸着还没有来得及打的麦垛，社员们刚刚栽完了麦茬稻田的稻秧，并且播种好了晚秋，突然连降暴雨，伏牛山上的洪水暴发了。横穿这个社的土地的小河里的水猛涨了。全社四千五百亩秋季作物，被水淹没了三千二百多亩，其中约占全社耕地面积五分之一以上的一千二百亩最好的耕地，被水冲得变成了沙滩。靠近河边的八十多户的沙圪?村也被淹了，其中有两户社员十口人就被洪水冲走了八口；淹死和冲走了耕牛等七十多头。这场无情的洪水，还冲垮了社员们在春季刚刚修起的小水库，淤平了大部分渠道，漂走了在不久以前刚刚安装上的水磨；无数的小麦被冲走或者被雨水沤坏了。
    这真是一场少见的凶暴的暴雨和山洪，它的巨大的破坏力，把许多须发皆白的老汉都吓住了。他们不仅没有经历过，而且从来也没有听到他们前辈谈过当地发过这样大的山水。
    洪水过去后，全社粗略统计了一下，财产上的损失真是惊人：单是那被水冲成沙滩已经无法再种的一千二百亩土地，加上被冲走与沤坏的小麦，共计就损失了粮食八十五万多斤；加上人畜伤亡、房屋倒塌和其他土地因灾减产等损失在内，损失有多大，简直没法估算。
    但是，这并没有吓倒辛自修和大多数社员。在山洪暴发的那天夜晚，河里还奔腾着骇人的巨浪，社里的一些共产党员和青年团员们便都冒着生命的危险，跑到遭灾最重的村庄去，抢救被水冲走的牲畜和财物。辛自修和社里的中共支部书记也亲自到遭灾最重的社员家里去逐户问寒问暖，具体帮助安排解决受灾户的生活困难问题。那次，社员王四娃在黑夜睡朦胧中听到洪水来了，他只顾逃命，把浑身上下的衣服都丢光了。社干部听到后就立即决定由社里拿出钱来替他做衣服。受灾后，曾经有一些社员信心动摇了：农业社还办得下去吗？今后的生活怎么办呢？有的甚至打算要携带着全家外出逃荒。经过社里这样细心地照顾，这些社员进一步体会到生活在这个大家庭里的温暖；情绪逐渐稳定了下来。
    那时候，摆在这个社面前的严重任务是迅速挽救和恢复全社的农业生产。雨停后，全社立即开始排水抢种和抢救秋禾。当时最大的难题是：怎样补种那些被毁了的秋禾？绝大部分被淹的地里还有积水，短时期内不能翻犁，补种晚秋却不能再迟了。
    总结了1955年夏季抗旱播种的经验后，这个社才解决了补种晚秋所面临的难题。1955年，还是初级社，麦收以后遇到干旱，拖迟了种晚秋作物的时间，最后便采用不耕地就点种的办法种了晚秋。这次，他们也决定采用这个办法，先把种子种到地里再说。经过社的安排和发动，全社女社员勇敢地担当起了这项任务。她们一个个都脱光脚板，站在深没膝盖的烂泥里，一手用棍捣孔，一手点种。每天从五更一直劳动到深夜。经过几天苦战，总算把种子又种到地里了。和这同时，全社的男社员更紧张。他们一部分人抢打被雨淋湿了的小麦，大部分人赶紧挖沟排水。全社几乎找不到一个闲人。
    就这样，在短短的五天里，这个社的两千多亩被水冲光了的秋田又完全补种上了，七百多亩可以挽救的早秋作物和水稻也把被冲倒了的禾苗扶正了，并且还利用村边地头和荒坡等休闲地栽种上了一百二十七万株红薯，八十七亩蔬菜，二百四十亩堰豆。
    为了争取秋季多收来弥补损失，这个社紧接着发动了一个消灭草荒和增施追肥的运动。在秋收以前的整个夏季中，全社用了最多的劳力管理秋田，彻底消灭了秋田的草荒现象。同时，全社又从各方面想尽办法积了一万多车（每车千斤以上）肥料，给秋作物施了追肥。在玉米生长的后期还普遍推行了玉米人工辅助授粉，争取玉米丰收。
    去年秋天，鲁山县出现了奇迹。中苏友谊农业社丰收了。这个遭受严重水灾，当时看来减产成了定局的农业社，经过一个夏天的集体劳动，终于丰收了，而且终于实现了春天所订的增产计划。去年这个社秋收的结果，各项粮食折合全社耕地每亩的原粮平均产量，仍然达到了五百零一斤，比丰收的1955年还提高了17％多。去年这个社由于遭灾便很重视副业生产，结果副业收入比1955年增加了两倍多，总收入达五万七千多元。分配的结果，这个社终于使全社90％以上的社员，在遭水灾后还比1955年增加了收入。
    中苏友谊农业社战胜了特大洪水灾害而赢得了丰收的事实，深深地教育了全体社员。半年多以前，曾经被水淹得到处都是破墙残垣的沙圪?村，现在新修的草房和瓦房已经连成了一片；曾被洪水冲得变成了沙滩的那一千二百亩肥沃良田，经过人们一冬的积极翻挖，现在已有不少重新露出了地面。全社单是沙圪?村就有四十多户社员因去年的水灾丧失了他们入社前原有的耕地，但是去年他们都和其他农民一样按劳动日分得了应得的报酬，其中有许多还成了余粮户。这村的富裕中农李正祥，过去总喜欢夸奖他原有的二十多亩稻田，说那块稻田多么肥壮哪，说那是最好的“保命地”哪，等等。去年一场无情的洪水把他那块“保命地”冲掉了。现在他逢人便说：“要不是有了农业社，我一家非外出逃荒不可！看来‘保命地’到底还不如‘保命社’！”
    一家五口被洪水冲走了四口的社员雷致和，他的全部家业几乎全部被水冲光了。可是，去年秋收后，他分到了八百斤粮食和六十元钱，不久以前又结了婚，重建了一个幸福的家庭。
    许多社员都从去年一年的实践中，深深地体会到农业社在抗御自然灾害的斗争中有多么巨大的力量。他们豪迈而又充满信心地说：“要想穷了中苏友谊社，天塌龙叫也不怕！”（附图片）
