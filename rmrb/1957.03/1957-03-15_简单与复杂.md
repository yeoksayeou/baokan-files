    Simple and Complex
    Hui Chun
    During the War of Resistance Against Japan, there was a political commissar in the Eighth Route Army, a cadre of peasant origin who had gone through the 25,000-li Long March. He had a low level of education, but he was good at identifying problems and solving them, so he did a good job and had a high reputation among the cadres. I once asked him what his experience was.

    "Experience? I wouldn't call it that," he said. "However, I have two habits. First, when I encounter simple things, I look at them as more complex; second, when I encounter complex problems, I simplify them."

    After hearing his words, and then looking at what he did, it was indeed the case. For example, once he came to my place and saw me reading a book of Tang poetry. He asked me what poetry was and asked me to recite a poem for him. I recited Du Fu's "Tonight, the moon in Fuzhou..." He wanted me to explain it in detail. Then, he asked me if the folk songs sung by the peasants were poetry; asked me if I felt that the moon had poetic meaning; asked me if I felt the moon was beautiful when I crossed the enemy's blockade line; and asked me if the Soviet novels also described the Red Army and workers appreciating the moon. He also asked if young men and women of intellectual backgrounds liked to stroll and talk romantically under the moonlight, could it be said to be a unique sentiment of the petty bourgeoisie? ... He asked for more than an hour, virtually without limit. Through this method of transforming the simple into the complex, he discovered many problems. But when dealing with a large, complex problem, he simplified it. He would hold a cadre meeting to discuss for three or four days, with thousands of opinions; when he made a conclusion, it only took two hours, grasping the core of the problem, raising it to the height of principle, affirming the basic truth, pointing out the main deviations, and prescribing simple and clear handling policies, without paying attention to the trivial details. After the conclusion was made, most people felt that their correct opinions had been adopted, and their wrong ideas had been corrected. He did not respond to each person's speech one by one, but everyone felt that their opinions had been considered and dealt with.

    I have always remembered his two sentences, and I increasingly feel that the principles of transforming the simple into the complex and transforming the complex into the simple are applicable not only to doing work but also to seeking knowledge. Marx examined a single cell of capitalist social wealth—the commodity—over and over again, studying many principles, so complex that reading the first few chapters of "Das Kapital" makes us feel dizzy. However, in the end, from the "sum total of all changes and all intertwining confusions" of capitalist society, which "even seventy Marxes could not grasp them all," he only "pointed out these changes and their historical development in their main points and fundamental points." (Lenin's words) From complexity to a new simplicity.

    Artists also use this method. When artists experience life, they observe every detail extremely carefully; but when creating, they must refine and omit many materials, while emphasizing phenomena that are sufficient to reflect the essence of life, even though they seem simple in life, but are emphasized and portrayed in the works.

    Our political commissar's two sentences probably contain some great dialectical truths?

    However, not all methods of "transforming the simple into the complex and transforming the complex into the simple" are correct. If this method is applied abstractly, it will be terrible. Hegel, in his article "Who Thinks Abstractly?" (see "Learning Translation Series," this year's second issue), cited two terrible examples.

    The first is about the view of a murderer. When the murderer is escorted to the execution ground, the "expert in studying people" is "to examine all the processes that led this person to commit the crime, he will understand the impact of his parents' bad relationship on his life experience and education, and will find that this person has been excessively severely punished for minor crimes, which made him hate the social system, which aroused his resistance and separated him from society..." and so on. In our present day, we still need to study and research from the perspective of class consciousness and class struggle. However, people who think in a simplified and abstract way say that the murderer "is a murderer, nothing more," and apart from the abstract concept that "he is a murderer," they can find nothing else on the murderer.

    The second example: A female vendor got angry simply because a female customer said that her eggs were rotten: "What? My eggs are rotten?! You stink yourself! ... You? Your father ate lice, and your mother had an affair with a Frenchman, right? Your grandma died in a nursing home, didn't she? ..." She slandered the female customer from head to toe—from her hat to her bedsheets, from head to toe, and her father and all her other relatives, everything was stained with the smell of rotten eggs. This old woman who sells eggs can be said to be good at making simple things very complex. However, she is complicating concepts based on abstract thinking, because in reality, that specific female customer may not have these stinky smells.

    Therefore, whenever I think of the political commissar's two sentences, I am also on guard.

    简单与复杂
    回春
    抗日战争的时候，有一位八路军的政治委员，是经过二万五千里长征的农民出身的干部。他的文化水平很低，但是善于发现问题，也善于解决问题，所以工作做得很好，在干部中威信很高。我曾经请问他，有什么经验？
    “经验？谈不上。”他说：“不过，我有两条习惯。第一条，碰到简单的事情，把它看得复杂些；第二条，碰到复杂的问题，把它弄得简单些。”
    我听了他的话，再看看他做的事，的确是这样。例如，有一次他到我处，看我在读一本唐诗，就问我诗是什么，叫我念一首给他听听。我念了杜甫的“今夜鄜州月……”，他要我详细解释。接着，他问我农民唱的山歌是不是诗；问我是不是觉得月亮有诗意；又问我在过敌人的封锁线的时候，觉不觉得月亮美；又问苏联的小说里面，写红军和工人是否也有赏月的。他又问，知识分子出身的青年男女爱在月光底下散步谈情，是否可以说是小资产阶级特有的情调？……问了一个多钟头，简直漫无边际。通过这种化简单为复杂的办法，他就发现了很多问题。但是当处理一个情况复杂的大问题时，他却化复杂为简单了。开一次干部会，讨论三、四天，意见千、百条；他做起结论来，不过两个钟头，抓住问题的中心，提到原则的高度，肯定基本的真理，指出主要的偏向，规定简单明了的处理方针，不去理会那些枝枝节节的东西。结论做后，大多数人觉得自己的正确意见既被采纳在里面，自己的错误想法也受到了纠正。他并没有针对每一个人的发言一一作答，但每一个人都认为自己的意见受到了考虑和处理。
    我一直记着他的两句话，并且愈来愈觉得，化简单为复杂和化复杂为简单的道理，不但适用于做工作，也适用于求学问。马克思，把资本主义社会财富的一个细胞——商品，考察来，考察去，研究出许多道理来，复杂得使我们读起“资本论”的头几章来，感到头昏眼花。然而，到了最后，却从“就是有七十个马克思也是不能把它们全部把握住”的资本主义社会的一切“变化的总和及其一切交错纷歧”中，只“在其主要点上和根本点上指出这些变化及其历史发展的”客观规律。（列宁语）由复杂达到新的简单。
    艺术家，也是用这办法的。艺术家在体验生活的时候，把每个小节观察得极仔细；但在创作的时候，却要下提炼工夫，把许多材料省略掉了，而对于足以反映生活本质的现象，在生活中看来虽是简单的，在作品中却加以着重刻划。
    我们的政治委员的两句话，恐怕很有些辩证法的大道理在里面吧？
    然而，并不是一切“化简单为复杂，化复杂为简单”的办法，都是对头的。这办法，倘若抽象地运用起来那就要糟糕。黑格尔在“谁在抽象地思维？”一文中，（见“学习译丛”今年第二期）就举着两个糟糕的例子。
    第一个是关于凶手的看法。凶手被押往刑场的时候，在“研究人的专家”，是“要考察一下促使这个人犯罪的一切经过，他会了解他父母的恶劣关系对他的生活经历和教育所发生的影响，会发现这个人曾经因为犯了轻微的罪过而受到过分严厉的惩罚，这使得他仇恨社会制度，这引起他的反抗，使他脱离了社会……”等等。在我们今日，还要从阶级意识和阶级斗争方面去研究研究。但是，简单化的抽象地思维的人们，却说凶手“是一个凶手，仅仅如此而已”，除了“他是凶手”这个抽象的概念而外，在凶手身上，再也找不到别的东西了。
    第二个例子：一位女商贩，仅仅因为女顾客说了一句她的蛋是臭的，她就恼火了：“什么？我的蛋是臭的？！你自己才臭哩！……你？你爸爸吃了虱子，你妈妈跟法国人相好吧？你奶奶死在养老院里了吧？……”她把那位女顾客全身上下编派了一番——从帽子到床单，从头到脚，还有爸爸和所有其余的亲戚，一切都沾上了臭蛋的气味。这位卖蛋的老太婆，可谓善于把简单的事情弄得十分复杂了。但是，她却是凭着抽象的思维，把概念弄复杂的，因为实际上，那位具体的女顾客，未必有这些臭气的。
    所以，每逢想起政治委员的那两句话的时候，我是又有所警戒的。
