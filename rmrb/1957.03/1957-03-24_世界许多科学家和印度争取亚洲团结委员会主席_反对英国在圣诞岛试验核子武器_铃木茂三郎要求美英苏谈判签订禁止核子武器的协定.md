Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd dispatch from Tokyo: The appeal by Japanese physicists to oppose British nuclear weapons testing on Christmas Island has received the support of many famous physicists around the world.

Among those who wrote letters expressing support for the Japanese physicists' appeal were the Association of Scientific Workers of the World, headed by Dr. Edwards, Dr. Bhabha, Chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission, Dr. Coulson, Professor at Oxford University, Dr. Lonsdale and Dr. Bernal, Professors at the University of London, and Dr. Pauling, Professor at the California Institute of Technology in the United States.

In other news: The famous British philosopher Russell wrote a letter to the "Manchester Guardian" on the 21st, expressing his opposition to the British hydrogen bomb test on Christmas Island in the Pacific.

He also said that a universal agreement to stop testing hydrogen bombs "may be possible" and that the British government should try to facilitate its realization.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 23rd: Ramishwori Nehru, Chairman of the Indian Committee for Asian Solidarity, issued an appeal to the press on the 22nd, requesting the British people to prevent Britain from conducting nuclear weapons tests on Christmas Island.

The appeal stated that the economically more advanced Western countries have been trying every means to oppress us Asians for a long time. The Asian people can no longer be treated as guinea pigs by the West. These tests must be stopped! Atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons must be banned!

Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd, Tokyo: Suzuki Mosaburo, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, wrote to US President Eisenhower, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin, and British Prime Minister Macmillan today, demanding a ban on atomic and hydrogen bomb tests.

The letter said that conducting atomic and hydrogen bomb tests poses the danger of exacerbating international tensions. The Japan Socialist Party hopes that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union will immediately begin negotiations on signing an agreement banning atomic and hydrogen bombs, and suspend atomic and hydrogen bomb tests during the negotiations.

The letter said that the Japan Socialist Party opposes the British planned hydrogen bomb test on Christmas Island. The Socialist Party believes that the British planned test will infringe upon the principle of freedom of navigation on the high seas stipulated by international law.

The Socialist Party also sent letters with the same content to the United Nations Secretary-General, the Socialist International, and the Asian Socialist Conference.

    据新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本物理学家们联合反对英国在圣诞岛试验核子武器的呼吁，得到世界许多著名物理学家的支持。
    写信表示支持日本物理学家这个呼吁的有，以爱德华兹博士为首的世界科学工作者协会，印度原子能委员会主席巴巴博士，牛津大学教授柯尔逊博士，伦敦大学教授朗斯戴尔博士、贝尔纳博士，美国加利福尼亚工学院教授保林博士等。
    另讯：英国著名哲学家罗素21日写了一封信给“曼彻斯特卫报”，表示反对英国在太平洋中的圣诞岛试验氢弹。
    他又说，就停止试验氢弹达成一项普遍的协议“也许是可能的”，英国政府应该设法促其实现。
    据新华社新德里23日电　印度争取亚洲团结委员会主席拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁22日向报界发表呼吁书，要求英国人民阻止英国在圣诞岛进行核子武器试验。
    呼吁书说，经济上比较先进的西方国家，长时期以来一直在想尽一切办法压迫我们亚洲人。亚洲人民再也不能被西方当作试验品了。这种试验必须制止！原子武器和氢武器必须禁止！
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎今天写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔、苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和英国首相麦克米伦，要求禁止原子弹和氢弹试验。
    信中说，进行原子弹和氢弹试验存在着加剧国际紧张局势的危险。日本社会党期望美、英、苏三国立即开始进行关于签订禁止原子弹和氢弹的协定的谈判，并且在进行谈判期间停止原子弹和氢弹的试验。
    信中说，日本社会党反对英国计划在圣诞岛进行的氢弹试验。社会党认为，英国计划举行的这次试验将会侵害国际法所规定的公海航行自由的原则。
    社会党还把同样内容的信件寄给联合国秘书长、社会党国际和亚洲社会党会议。
