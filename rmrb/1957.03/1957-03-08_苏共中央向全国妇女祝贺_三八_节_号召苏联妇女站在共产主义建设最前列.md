Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 7th: TASS reported from Moscow on March 7th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued a letter to Soviet women, congratulating them on the "March 8th" International Women's Day, and called on them to participate more actively in the political and social life of the country, participate in the activities of the Soviet of Working People's Deputies, strive to improve the work of state and economic institutions, eliminate all forms of bureaucracy and procrastination, and further improve the labor and living conditions of women.

The letter to Soviet women stated that the Communist Party has always attached great importance to absorbing women into economic and cultural construction. During the years of Soviet power, the cultural level of Soviet women has improved incomparably. Women account for 53% of experts with higher education, and there are 480,000 women who are engineers and technicians. There are a total of 265,000 female doctors in the Soviet Union, 1,164,000 female teachers, and more than 86,000 women working in various scientific departments.

The letter to Soviet women stated that the Communist Party and the Soviet government highly appreciate the spirit of selfless work of Soviet women. More than one million female workers in the Soviet Union have been awarded Soviet medals and orders, 2,359 women have been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, and 70 women have been awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Among the awarded women, many have made contributions in the development of virgin lands.

The CPC Central Committee is deeply convinced that Soviet women, together with all the Soviet people, will continue to tirelessly strive to realize the historic resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU and strengthen the power of the socialist motherland with their selfless labor.

The letter to Soviet women went on to say that the worldwide movement of women striving for peace and friendship among the people of all countries is constantly expanding, and Soviet women are actively participating in this movement.

The letter to Soviet women finally called on Soviet women to unite more closely around the Communist Party and the Soviet government, stand at the forefront of communist construction, continuously strengthen close friendship with socialist countries, and tirelessly strengthen international ties with women in capitalist countries.

    苏共中央向全国妇女祝贺“三八”节
    号召苏联妇女站在共产主义建设最前列
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科7日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会发表了告苏联妇女书，向她们祝贺“三八”国际妇女节，并且号召她们更加积极地参加国家的政治和社会生活，参加劳动人民代表苏维埃的活动，努力争取改善国家和经济机构的工作，消除形形色色的官僚主义和疲沓作风，进一步改善妇女的劳动和生活条件。
    告苏联妇女书说，共产党一直非常重视吸收妇女参加经济和文化建设。在苏维埃政权年代里，苏联妇女的文化水平不可比拟地提高了。在受过高等教育的专家中，妇女占53％，有四十八万个妇女是工程师和技术员。苏联共有二十六万五千个女医生，有一百一十六万四千个女教师，有八万六千多妇女在各科学部门工作。
    告苏联妇女书说，共产党和苏联政府对苏联妇女忘我工作的精神评价很高。苏联有一百万多妇女劳动者获得了苏联的勋章和奖章，有二千三百五十九名妇女获得了社会主义劳动英雄称号，有七十名妇女获得了苏联英雄的称号。在受奖的妇女中，有许多是在开垦荒地方面立了功的。
    苏共中央委员会深信，苏联妇女和全体苏联人民一道，今后也将不倦地争取实现苏共第二十次代表大会的历史性决议，用自己忘我的劳动加强社会主义祖国的威力。
    告苏联妇女书接着说，全世界妇女争取和平和各国人民友谊的运动正在不断扩大，苏联妇女积极地参加了这个运动。
    告苏联妇女书最后号召苏联妇女更加紧密地团结在共产党和苏联政府周围，站在共产主义建设的最前列，不断加强同社会主义阵营各国的密切友谊，不倦地加强同资本主义国家的妇女的国际联系。
