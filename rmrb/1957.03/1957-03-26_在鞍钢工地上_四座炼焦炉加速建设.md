　  At Anshan Iron and Steel Works
    Four Coke Ovens Accelerate Construction

    Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Xiangbo reports: After a full year of construction, Anshan Iron and Steel's new coke ovens No. 1, 2, 3, and 4 have now begun the process of laying refractory bricks or laying foundations.

    On this coke oven construction site, which spans dozens of miles, smokestacks hundreds of meters high have already been erected, a row of scrubbing towers is being pressure-tested, and various metal pipelines have also been installed.

    Of these four large coke ovens, three will be put into production this year, and the other can also be basically completed. According to Soviet experts, in terms of its scale and the concentrated degree of commissioning, there is no precedent in the world. After these four coke ovens are all put into production at the beginning of next year, it will increase Anshan Iron and Steel's coke production capacity by 50%.

　　Open-pit Magnesite Mine Under Full Construction

    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, March 25th: Anshan Iron and Steel's large-scale Qingshan Huai open-pit magnesite mine has begun full construction.

    In order to complete this first modern magnesite mine in our country as soon as possible, batches of builders have come here since the second half of last year. The quiet Qingshan Huai valley has become a lively scene of labor. Now, a winding mountain road leading to the outside of the valley has been completed, and the construction of topsoil stripping and crushing and screening workshops are all in full swing. By the end of this year, this magnesite mine will be able to start small-scale production.

    Qingshan Huai magnesite mine is part of the world-famous Dashiqiao magnesite mine. It contains abundant magnesite, which, after being developed, will be supplied to the Dashiqiao magnesite brick factory, which is currently under construction, to manufacture magnesite bricks and chrome-magnesite bricks. Chrome-magnesite bricks are important materials for the metallurgical industry. According to tests, steel-making furnaces built with them have a longer lifespan and shorter melting time than those built with silicon bricks, which can increase steel production.

    Magnesium is a relatively rare mineral, with rhombus-shaped, luminous white patterns. According to experts, a magnesium content of 43% in this mineral would be considered very good, but the magnesium content of Qingshan Huai magnesite mine is as high as 46%.

　  在鞍钢工地上
    四座炼焦炉加速建设
    据新华社记者张向波报道：经过整整一年的建设，鞍钢新的一、二、三、四号炼焦炉现在分别开始砌筑耐火砖或打基础的工程。
    在这方圆数十里的炼焦炉工地上，上百公尺高的烟囱已经耸立起来，一排洗涤塔正在试压，各种金属管道也架设起来了。
    这四座大型炼焦炉中，今年内将有三座投入生产，另一座也可以基本建成。据苏联专家们说，就它的规模和开工生产的集中程度来说，世界上是没有先例的。这四座炼焦炉在明年初全部投入生产以后，它可使鞍钢生产焦炭的能力增加50％。
　　露天镁矿全面施工
    据新华社鞍山25日电　鞍钢规模很大的青山怀露天镁矿开始全面施工。
    为了把这座我国第一座的现代化镁矿早日建成，从去年下半年开始，就有成批的建设者来到这里。幽静的青山怀山谷便出现了劳动的热闹情景。现在，通向谷外的一条曲折绕山的公路，已经修完，浮土剥离和破碎筛分车间的建筑，都在紧张进行。到今年年底，这座镁矿就能开始少量生产了。
    青山怀镁矿是世界闻名的大石桥镁矿的一部分。这里蕴藏着丰富的菱镁矿，把它开发出来以后，将供给目前正在建设的大石桥镁砖厂来制造镁砖和铬镁砖。铬镁砖是冶金工业用的重要材料，据试验，用它砌筑的炼钢炉，比用硅砖寿命长，熔炼时间短，可以提高钢的产量。
    镁是一种较稀有的矿物，有着菱形发光的白花纹。据专家们说，这种矿物含镁量占43％就算是很好的了，而青山怀镁矿含镁成分却高到46％。
