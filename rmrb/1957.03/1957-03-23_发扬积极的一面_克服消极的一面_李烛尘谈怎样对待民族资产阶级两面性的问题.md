I heard Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people at the enlarged meeting of the Eleventh Supreme State Conference. Chairman Mao made a correct assessment of the Chinese national bourgeoisie and a thorough analysis of the transformation of Chinese national bourgeois elements. Chairman Mao's instructions were very enlightening to us, and I couldn't help but share my personal experiences with everyone. As one of the persons in charge of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Central Standing Committee, I would also like to take this opportunity to share my personal opinions with the industrial and commercial members. If there are any inappropriate points, please criticize and advise the committee members, industrial and commercial comrades, and members.

Over the past year, the national bourgeoisie has undergone profound changes, and it should be affirmed that there has been considerable progress; however, negative aspects have also been revealed.

In the past eight years, our industrialists and businessmen have accepted the leadership of the Chinese working class and its vanguard, the Chinese Communist Party. In the process of self-education and self-transformation, we have continuously made progress. At the beginning of last year, when the high tide of the socialist revolution arrived, we welcomed the joint state-private ownership of all trades with gongs and drums. After the joint venture, we enthusiastically participated in the study of political theory and actively worked to improve the relationship of public-private cooperation and to improve the production and management of enterprises. In the Learning Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce's "Summary Report on the Work of Short-term Training Classes for Industrialists and Businessmen," it was mentioned that such classes have generally been held more than twice in various parts of the country, with a total of more than 50,000 participants, most of whom have gained to varying degrees. Last September, when I participated in the welcome meeting of the "Socialist Political School" sponsored by the local Municipal Political Consultative Conference in Shenyang, I learned that there were 816 industrialists and businessmen studying full-time and living on campus in this school, and 134 members of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce organized temporary branches that played a certain backbone role. All the students were in high spirits and asked me to bring their guarantee of doing a good job in their studies to Chairman Mao. According to the statistical data of some local organizations of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, industrial and commercial members who participated in socialist competitions and won the honorary title of advanced producers (workers) and received awards accounted for about 20% of the total number of participants in the competition, and this ratio increased every quarter. These examples made me excited to see that the enthusiasm of our industrialists and businessmen for studying hard and working hard is constantly growing and expanding. After the high tide of joint state-private ownership of all trades in January last year, Mr. Sheng Pihua and I, on the opening day of the second plenary meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, together with representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors and their families from all over the country, reported good news to Chairman Mao and the Party and government leading comrades, and put forward three guarantees: "First, we must strengthen our studies and better transform our thinking; second, we must obey leadership, be dutiful and conscientious, and do a good job in production and management; third, we must strive to learn skills, learn socialist management methods, and transform ourselves into self-reliant workers." We are now taking practical actions to fulfill the guarantees we have provided.

Over the past year, the Chinese national bourgeoisie has undergone profound changes, and industrialists and businessmen have made considerable progress, which is the main aspect and should be affirmed; however, it would be unrealistic to say that the existence of the bourgeoisie and the thoughts, styles, views, and methods reflected from it have not hindered the transformation and progress of industrialists and businessmen to a certain extent. At present, what is worth noting is that some industrialists and businessmen only see the positive aspects they have shown and overestimate them; they ignore the negative and backward aspects, and even deny them. Some have spoken out; some do not say it, but keep it in their hearts. Don't we often hear such reflections? In some enterprises, the relationship between public and private cooperation is not very good, there is a certain distance between the staff and workers and the private personnel, the enthusiasm of the private personnel is not high, and there are still some problems in the production and management of the enterprise. Some people analyze the reason for this as: the public representatives and the staff and workers do not unite, help, encourage, support, and trust the private personnel enough, and they should bear the main responsibility. When we examine it from the perspective of the public representatives and the staff and workers of these enterprises, of course, there are things that deserve attention and should be improved, and we should dare to put forward our opinions, demands, and suggestions. However, if we strictly examine it from the perspective of our industrialists and businessmen, there are quite a few problems. Do we have a fear of criticism? Do we have the thought of not wanting to be transformed, not wanting to mention class relations and the relationship between leadership and being led? Do we have the thought of regarding the wealth of the country as our own, but not willing to contribute it easily, satisfied with the old ways of capitalist management, and looking down on the public representatives and the staff and workers? Do we still have the thought of caring about fame and treatment, suspecting each other, and only paying attention to personal interests? Do we have a sense of inferiority because the class is declining and we cannot be arrogant? In the final analysis, are we, to varying degrees, still having incorrect or even resistant thoughts and emotions in different times and under different circumstances in terms of further accepting the leadership of the working class and accepting socialist transformation? In my opinion, these ideological situations still exist to a greater or lesser extent. This kind of ideological emotion, which is rooted in not recognizing or not wanting to face the two-sidedness of the bourgeoisie today, actually reflects the backward side, and will harm the initiative and enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen in further accepting socialist transformation.

To be the wealth of the country, not a burden, we must accept the leadership of the working class in enterprises or institutions, face our two-sidedness, constantly improve our ideological understanding, and contribute to socialism.

Since the joint state-private ownership of all trades, the Party and the government have made proper arrangements for our industrialists and businessmen in accordance with the principles of employing people according to their talents and giving appropriate consideration. Most people are arranged in enterprises, and some have also participated in state power organs and are responsible for leadership work. According to incomplete statistics from 116 places in the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, there are more than 600 members of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce in provinces and cities who hold leadership positions at the provincial, municipal, and district levels, including 8 vice governors, 82 vice mayors, 31 directors and deputy directors of departments, and 149 directors and deputy directors of bureaus. Most of the members and comrades can be dutiful and conscientious in their new work positions and live up to the expectations of the Party and the people. For example, a comrade who is the vice governor said: "I want to contribute all my strength to socialism. I will definitely do what I know, and even if I am not asked, I will find them and talk about my opinions"; the comrades who are vice mayors and deputy directors in a city under the jurisdiction of a province believe that "if you don't understand, ask; if you can't, learn; if it's wrong, argue; be bold; be open-minded to correction." These are all worth learning. However, there are also many members who do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance and role of participating in government work, and there are vague ideas about accepting the leadership of the working class and further accepting transformation. Therefore, some are detached from the masses and are unwilling to represent the legitimate interests of the industrial and commercial sectors; some think that they have been transformed almost completely, and they are growing arrogant and complacent. Under the control of such ideological emotions, it is not easy to serve the people well, and it is not good for their own transformation. This should also be admitted as a concrete manifestation of the negative side of the bourgeoisie.

When the bourgeoisie has not yet been eliminated and the transformation of bourgeois elements has not yet been completed, it is important for our industrialists and businessmen to clearly recognize ideologically that the bourgeoisie still has two sides today, and to seriously and solemnly treat our negative and backward side without the slightest tolerance, that is, to admit the difference between the working class and the bourgeoisie, to admit the leading position of the working class in the socialist revolution, and to admit that the bourgeoisie needs to further accept transformation. With such a correct viewpoint and position, it will greatly advance our industrialists and businessmen in the process of transforming from exploiters to laborers. Many industrialists and businessmen have improved their ideological understanding through study and practice, and they consciously feel refreshed, and their views on problems are different from before, strengthening their belief in accepting leadership and accepting transformation. This is the reason.

The Second Plenary Session of the First Central Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, held last November, after serious study and discussion, appropriately launched criticism and self-criticism, and made affirmative decisions on the two principled issues of the two-sidedness of the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the leadership relationship between the working class and the national bourgeoisie. After the meeting, it was conveyed to 24,000 members in 136 places across the country and a wide-ranging discussion was launched. Some places, after fierce debate and detailed analysis, finally reached a consensus on fundamental issues, thereby strengthening unity. This time, Chairman Mao made a conclusion on the issue of the two-sidedness of the Chinese national bourgeoisie, and instructed us to adopt the method of explaining the truth in resolving contradictions and ideological problems among the people; to proceed from the desire for unity, to achieve the goal of unity on a new basis through criticism and struggle. Chairman Mao's great instructions have become a tremendous source of encouragement and impetus for how to strengthen the political and ideological education work of the industrial and commercial sectors in the future.

Our country's socialist cause is leaping forward, and the people of the whole country are striving to build our country into an advanced industrial country. Our industrialists and businessmen have the obligation and responsibility to participate in this great cause. Chairman Mao said that we are the wealth of the country, not a burden, in order to encourage us to contribute our talents, experience, and technology that are conducive to socialist production and construction without reservation. We must be diligent and conscientious to make ourselves worthy of the name of wealth. Otherwise, if we stand idly by in the cause of the people and slack off when things happen, we will not be worthy of being called wealth, but will become a burden to the country. Our industrialists and businessmen must, in combination with the practice of production and work in enterprises or state organs, establish the ideological emotion of loving the working people and learning from their noble qualities, faithfully accept the leadership of the working class and its vanguard, the Chinese Communist Party, face our two-sidedness, strive to overcome the negative side, promote the positive side, further strengthen self-education and self-transformation, strengthen the study of political theory, constantly improve our ideological understanding, actively participate in the socialist competition movement centered on increasing production and practicing economy, and contribute to the country's socialist construction. By doing so, I believe that when the Chinese national bourgeoisie is eliminated with the completion of the socialist revolution, we, as members of the national bourgeoisie, will certainly be able to become members of the working class and continue to move towards an infinitely bright and beautiful goal.

　　发扬积极的一面　克服消极的一面
　　李烛尘谈怎样对待民族资产阶级两面性的问题
    我在第十一次最高国务会议的扩大会议上听到了毛主席就正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题所作的指示。毛主席对于中国民族资产阶级作出了正确的估价，对于中国民族资产阶级分子的改造问题也作了透辟的分析。毛主席的指示给我们的启发很大，使我情不自禁地把个人的体会向大家谈谈。作为中国民主建国会中央常务委员会负责人之一，也借这个机会对工商业者会员同志们谈谈个人的意见。不当的地方，请委员同志们、工商业者同志们、会员同志们批评、指教。
    一年来民族资产阶级起了深刻的变化，应该肯定，进步不少；但也表现出来消极的一面。
    八年来我们工商业者接受了中国工人阶级及其先锋队中国共产党的领导，在自我教育和自我改造的过程中，不断地取得了进步。去年年初，当社会主义革命高潮到来的时候，我们敲锣打鼓地迎接全行业公私合营；合营以后，我们热烈地参加政治理论的学习，积极地为搞好公私合作共事关系、为搞好企业的生产经营而努力，在我会学习委员会“关于工商业者短期讲习班工作的总结报告”里，提到全国各地这样的班一般已办到二期以上，参加学习的约计已超过五万人，绝大多数都有不同程度的收获；去年9月，我在沈阳参加当地市政协主办的“社会主义政治学校”的欢迎会，知道在这个学校里，脱产住校、集中学习的工商业者就有八百一十六人，民建会员一百三十四人组织临时支部起着一定的骨干作用。全体学员的学习情绪很高，叮咛我把他们搞好学习的保证带给毛主席。根据中国民主建国会部分地方组织的统计资料，工商业者会员参加社会主义竞赛取得先进生产（工作）者的光荣称号和得到奖励的，约占参加竞赛总人数的20％，这个比率每季均有所上升。这些事例使我兴奋地看到我们工商业者努力学习、努力工作的积极性，正在不断地增长和扩大。去年1月全行业公私合营高潮到来以后，我和盛丕华委员在我会第二次全体会议开幕的那一天，和来自全国各地的工商界代表及家属一起，向毛主席和党政领导同志报喜，提出了三项保证：“第一，我们一定加强学习，更好地改造我们的思想；第二，我们一定服从领导，守职尽责，搞好生产经营；第三，我们一定努力学会本领，学会社会主义经营管理方法，改造自己成为自食其力的劳动者”。我们现在正以实际行动来履行我们已提供的保证。
    一年以来，中国民族资产阶级起了深刻的变化，工商业者进步不小，这是主要的一面，应当肯定的；但是，如果说，没有由于资产阶级的存在和从它反映出来的思想、作风、观点、方法一定程度地阻碍着工商业者的改造和进步，那也是不现实的。目前，值得重视的，就是部分的工商业者只看见自己表现出来的积极的一面，对它作过高的估价；忽视消极落后的另一面，甚至否定了它。有的谈了出来；有的嘴上不说，摆在心里。我们不是常常听到这样的反映吗？在一些企业里，公私共事关系不大好，职工群众与私方人员之间有一定的距离，私方人员的积极性不高，企业的生产经营还存在一些问题，有人分析它的原因为：公方代表与职工群众对私方人员团结、帮助、鼓励、支持、信任不够，他们应负主要的责任。从这些企业的公方代表和职工群众方面检查起来，当然不是没有值得注意和应当改进的地方，我们应该敢于提出我们的意见、要求和建议。但是，如果从我们工商业者方面严格检查一下，问题是很不少的。我们是否有害怕批评的思想呢？我们是否有不愿听改造，不愿提阶级关系和领导与被领导的关系的思想呢？我们是否有以国家的财富自居，但又不肯轻易贡献出来，满足于资本主义经营的老一套，看不起公方代表和职工群众的思想呢？我们是否还有计较名位待遇，相互猜忌，只注意个人利益的思想呢？我们是否有由于阶级没落，自高自大不起来，才怀有自卑的情绪呢？归根结底一句话，我们在进一步接受工人阶级领导和接受社会主义改造这两方面，是否在不同的时候，不同的情况下，还有不同程度的不正确的乃至抵触的思想情绪呢？在我看来，这些思想情况是或多或少地还存在着一些的。这种根源于不认识或者不愿正视资产阶级今天还有两面性的，其实是反映落后一面的思想情绪，是会伤害工商业者进一步接受社会主义改造的主动性和积极性的。
    要当国家的财富，不当包袱，就必须在企业或机关里接受工人阶级的领导，正视自己的两面性，不断提高思想认识水平，为社会主义作出贡献。
    全行业公私合营以来，党和政府把我们工商业者在量才录用、适当照顾的原则下作了妥善的安排，多数人安排在企业里，有的人还参加了政权机关负着领导工作的责任。根据中国民主建国会一百一十六个地方的不完全统计，各省、市民建工商业者会员担任省、市、区级领导工作的有六百余人，其中副省长八人，副市长八十二人，正副厅长三十一人，正副局长一百四十九人。多数的会员同志们能在新的工作岗位上守职尽责，不辜负党和人民对他们的期望。如担任副省长的一位同志说：“我要为社会主义贡献出我的一切力量，我知道的事一定去做，即便不来问我，也要找上去谈出我的意见”；在一个省辖市担任副市长、副局长的同志们认定“不懂、问；不会、学；不对、争；大胆做；虚心改”。这些都是值得学习的。但也有不少会员，对于参加政权工作的意义和作用认识不足，对于接受工人阶级领导，进一步接受改造存在着模糊思想，因而有的脱离群众，不愿代表工商界合法利益；有的自以为改造得差不多了，滋长着骄傲自满的情绪。在这样的思想情绪支配下，既不容易很好地为人民服务，对于自己的改造也是没有好处的。这也应当承认是资产阶级消极的一面的具体表现。
    当资产阶级还未消灭，资产阶级分子的改造尚未完成的时候，我们工商业者从思想上明确认识资产阶级今天还有两面性，认真严肃地对待我们消极落后的一面，不稍姑息，也就是承认工人阶级与资产阶级的区别，承认工人阶级在社会主义革命中的领导地位，承认资产阶级需要进一步接受改造。有了这样一个正确的观点和立场，这就使我们工商业者从剥削者向劳动者转变的过程中大大地跨前一步。不少工商业者通过学习和实践提高了思想认识，就自觉耳目一新，看问题也和以前两样了，加强了接受领导，接受改造的信念，道理就在这里。
    去年11月举行的中国民主建国会第一届中央委员会第二次全体会议，曾经经过认真地研究和讨论，适当地展开了批评与自我批评，对于中国民族资产阶级还存在着两面性和工人阶级对于民族资产阶级的领导关系这两个原则性的问题，作出了肯定的决定。会后在全国一百三十六个地方的二万四千位会员当中，进行了传达，展开了广泛的讨论，有些地方经过激烈的争论和详尽的分析，终于在根本性的问题上，取得一致的认识，从而加强了团结。这次，毛主席对于中国民族资产阶级具有两面性的问题，作出了结论，并指示我们在人民内部解决矛盾和思想问题，需要采取讲清道理的方法；一切从团结的愿望出发，经过批评和斗争，在新的基础上达到团结的目的。毛主席的伟大指示，对于今后如何加强工商界的政治思想教育工作，成为十分巨大的鼓舞和推动的力量。
    我们国家的社会主义事业在飞跃地向前进展，全国人民正为把我们的国家建设成为一个先进的工业国而奋斗。我们工商业者有义务也有责任参加这一个伟大的事业。毛主席说我们是国家的财富，不是包袱，为的是鼓励我们把有利于社会主义生产建设的才能、经验和技术，无保留地贡献出来。我们一定要兢兢业业，使自己成为名副其实的财富，不然的话，我们假若对于人民的事业，袖手旁观，遇事松劲，那就不配称为财富，而变为国家的包袱。我们工商业者一定要结合着在企业里或者在国家机关里的生产实践和工作实践，树立起热爱劳动人民，学习他们的高贵品质的思想感情，忠诚接受工人阶级及其先锋队中国共产党的领导，正视自己的两面性，努力克服消极的一面，发扬积极的一面，进一步加强自我教育和自我改造，加强政治理论学习，不断地提高我们的思想认识水平，积极地参加以增产节约为中心的社会主义竞赛运动，对国家的社会主义建设，作出贡献，这样做下去，我相信，当中国民族资产阶级随着社会主义革命的完成而消灭的时候，作为民族资产阶级分子的我们，一定能够成为工人阶级的一员，向着一个无限光明美好的目标继续前进。（附图片）
