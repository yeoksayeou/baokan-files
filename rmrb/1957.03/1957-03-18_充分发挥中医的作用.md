    Give full play to the role of traditional Chinese medicine.
    Strengthen leadership and assistance to traditional Chinese medicine; pay attention to cultivating teachers and new forces of traditional Chinese medicine, attach importance to research work; delve more into the literature of predecessors and modern medical theories, and strengthen unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and between traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners.
    Joint Speech by Zhao Shuping and Qin Bowei
    We warmly support Chairman Mao's speech and Premier Zhou's report, and fully agree with the special reports of the leaders.
    We are practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine. Please allow us to offer some opinions on matters related to traditional Chinese medicine. The Party has liberated traditional Chinese medicine, and in the past few years, under the correct leadership of the Party, our colleagues in traditional Chinese medicine have also exerted significant strength and played a significant role, fully demonstrating their enthusiasm and creativity. More and more people and international friends are requesting treatment with traditional Chinese medicine, and traditional Chinese medicine has used a variety of methods to cure various diseases and some relatively difficult diseases. For example, leprosy, epidemic encephalitis B, infantile paralysis, thromboangiitis obliterans, schistosomiasis, late-stage ascites, etc. We believe that with the continuous efforts of traditional Chinese medicine and the help and cooperation of Western medicine doctors, we will achieve greater success.
    Under the education and care of the Party and the government, the thinking of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners has also greatly changed. They have all responded to the government's call, some have already given up private practice, and some are striving to take the path of collectivization. This is particularly evident in the automatic establishment of joint clinics. According to recent estimates, there are already two to three thousand such clinics nationwide, and some have also joined health stations in agricultural cooperatives. Western medicine doctors also participate in these organizations, but traditional Chinese medicine practitioners account for a larger proportion. Some joint clinics examine seven or eight hundred or even more than one thousand people per day. In addition to busy work, they also squeeze out time to complete prevention and other tasks. However, in many areas, they are still only used and rarely cared for, with insufficient leadership and assistance, remaining in a state of laissez-faire. Some places even strictly limit loans and restrict the establishment of pharmacies. This practice of "wanting the horse to run fast but not wanting it to eat grass" has already caused some adverse effects in the medical community. We believe that joint clinics and other organizations still have a certain role to play for a considerable period of time. At present, it is necessary for the health departments to strengthen leadership over joint clinics and other organizations and give them appropriate care. At a minimum: they should not be simply used and participate in public labor, but should be given appropriate remuneration; appropriate subsidies should be given to those with poor conditions and great difficulties; for business convenience, they should be allowed to set up pharmacies and allowed to collect the legally prescribed profits. As for the ranks of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, although they are relatively large, they are not sufficient to undertake the health care work in the vast rural areas. If the joint clinics and health stations appropriately organize mobile medical teams so that farmers can receive timely treatment without hindering production, it is also a method worth considering.
    In order to better inherit and promote traditional Chinese medicine, it is necessary to cultivate new forces and attach importance to research work, and strengthen close cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine. In order to strengthen the study of traditional Chinese medicine and the mutual learning between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, it is necessary to solve an extremely important problem of teachers of traditional Chinese medicine. At present, there is a lack of teachers of traditional Chinese medicine, and the quality is also relatively poor. Although there are many learned old gentlemen, they are, after all, a minority, and it is still difficult for them to come up with a perfect teaching method. Therefore, it is necessary to attach importance to the training of teachers of traditional Chinese medicine. We believe that research work must emphasize the importance of the old gentlemen and draw more of their living experience from them. The training of teachers should pay attention to traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in their forties and fifties. They have considerable knowledge and experience, and some have also received new education. If they can be organized for short-term training, the results can be achieved with less effort. This work can be entrusted to the four colleges of traditional Chinese medicine or local schools of traditional Chinese medicine (refresher schools) and treated as a long-term task.
    The above are two things that need to be done well in the work of traditional Chinese medicine. Using existing institutions to develop them is relatively economical, fast, and easy to achieve. Whether it is appropriate or not, please let the relevant departments discuss it.
    In addition, we would also like to sincerely say a few words to our colleagues in traditional Chinese medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine has rich content, but it must be systematically explored and organized. We must also delve more into the literature of our predecessors and refer to modern medical science theories so that we can constantly enrich and improve ourselves and carry forward our country's medicine on its original basis. In order to implement the Party's call and to meet the needs of the broad masses of the people, we must have confidence and patience, have unity of thought and unity of action, and do this work more and better. The most important issue is the issue of unity. In the future, we must strengthen the close unity between our traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and do a good job in the close unity of the entire medical community between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, give play to the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation, and work hand in hand for the health of the people and advance towards science.

### 充分发挥中医的作用

    充分发挥中医的作用
    加强对中医的领导和帮助；注意培养中医师资和新生力量，重视研究工作；更多地钻研前人文献和现代医学理论，加强中医之间和中西医之间的团结、合作。
    赵树屏、秦伯未的联合发言
    我们热烈拥护毛主席的讲话和周总理的报告，并完全同意各位首长的专题报告。
    我们是中医工作者，请允许我们在有关中医方面提供一些意见。党使中医翻了身，几年来中医同道们在党的正确领导下也发挥了显著的力量和作用，充分地表现了积极性和创造性。广大群众和国际友人要求中医治病的愈来愈多，中医运用了多种多样的方法，医好了多种病症和有些比较难治的病。例如麻风病、流行性乙型脑炎、小儿麻痹症、脱疽、血吸虫病、晚期腹水症等等。我们相信，中医不断地努力，并有西医师们帮助合作，将会取得更多的成绩。
    中医的思想在党和政府的教育和关怀之下也大大转变了。他们都响应了政府号召，有的已经放弃了私人开业，有的争取走向集体道路。特别表现在自动地建立起联合诊所，据最近估计全国已达两三万个，还有参加了农业合作社的保健站。这些组织里面，也有西医师们参加，但中医占着较大比重。有的联合诊所每天诊察七、八百号人次以至一千号人次以上。在繁忙的业务之外，还挤出时间来完成了预防和其它任务。然而，不少地区至今仍是只有使用，很少照顾，领导帮助不够，停留在自流状态。甚至有些地方严格贷款，限制设立药柜等。这种“既要马儿好，又要马儿不吃草”的作法，已经在医务界中引起部分不良的影响。我们认为联合诊所等在相当长的时期内还有它一定的作用，目前卫生部门加强对联合诊所等组织的领导，予以适当的照顾是必要的。最低限度：要不单纯使用，参加公共劳动，给予适当的报酬；条件较差和十分困难的酌予补助；为了业务上便利，应该允许设立药柜，准其收取规定的合法利润。至于中医的队伍虽然比较庞大，但要担负广大农村的保健工作是不够的。如果由联合诊所和保健站适当地组织巡回医疗队，使农民在不妨碍生产下得到及时的治疗，也是值得考虑的一个办法。
    为了更好地继承和发扬祖国医学，必须培养新生力量和重视研究工作，加强中西医之间的密切合作。为了加强中医的学习和中西医的相互学习，这就必须解决一个极其重要的中医师资问题。从目前来说，中医的师资是缺乏的，质量也比较差，虽然有不少饱学的老先生，毕竟少数，要他们拿出一套尽善尽美的教学方法还有困难。因而必须重视中医师资的培养。我们认为：研究工作必须强调重视老先生们，从他们手里吸取更多的活的经验。师资的培养应该注意四、五十岁的中医师们，他们具有相当的学识和经验，有的还受过新的教育。如能把他们组织起来，进行短期训练，就可事半功倍。这项工作，可以委托四所中医学院或各地的中医学校（进修学校）来做，并且作为长期任务。
    以上是在中医工作中急需做到做好的两件事。利用现有机构来加以发展，比较又省又快，容易实现。是否有当，请有关部门予以讨论。
    此外，我们对中医同道们本身方面也想诚恳地说几句。祖国医学是有丰富内容的，但必须加以系统的发掘和整理。我们就还要更多地钻研前人文献，也要参考现代医学科学理论，使自己不断地充实和提高，把我国医学在原有基础上发扬光大。为了贯彻党的号召，为了适应广大人民的要求，要有信心，有耐心，思想一致，行动一致，把这项工作做到更多更好，最关重要的问题是团结问题。今后必须加强我们中医间密切团结，做好中西医间整个医务界的密切团结，发挥互助协作的精神，为人民健康事业，向科学进军而携手前进。
