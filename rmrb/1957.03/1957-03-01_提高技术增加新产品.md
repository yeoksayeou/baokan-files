Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 28th: An 800-horsepower air compressor suitable for large-scale factories and mines in our country has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant. This air compressor is the largest new product currently produced in our country. It can deliver 100 cubic meters of compressed air per minute and can drive a two-ton air hammer.

The structure of the 800-horsepower air compressor is entirely new and is equipped with an excellent pressure device that can automatically control pressure and air volume. Using this large air compressor is better than using smaller air compressors; it is more efficient and saves electricity.

Spraying Steel on Cast Iron Castings
Our newspaper reports: A new metal spraying technology has been successfully tested at the Shanghai No. 2 Steel Plant, namely spraying steel on cold-cast rolls. This is a problem that has not been solved for many years.

With the help of the Central Laboratory of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company, the factory's technical personnel sprayed steel on the worn neck of the cold-cast roll and put it back into production. This extends the life of the rolls, saving 200 rolls per year, worth more than 70,000 yuan.

This experience of spraying metal on cast iron castings can be extended to spraying any mechanically worn parts.

Metal Hardness Testing Machine
Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 28th: Two metal hardness testing machines trial-produced by the Changchun Instrument Factory have been successfully manufactured.

Design engineer Zheng Zhang placed a standard hardness block on the test bench and demonstrated its use. The test results showed that the error in the hardness value did not exceed plus or minus one degree, and the load output error did not exceed plus or minus one percent. Its precision meets international standards.

This year, with the specific help of instrument manufacturing experts from the German Democratic Republic, this instrument factory will also trial-produce four types of universal material testing machines, including ten-ton and one-hundred-ton models.

The hardness testing machine is the tenth new product successfully trial-produced by the Changchun Instrument Factory since its establishment more than a year ago. This precision instrument was successfully trial-produced by imitating a German sample and making improvements. It plays a significant role in the testing of metal hardness in the metallurgical, machinery industries, and scientific research institutions.

The various universal material testing machines, steel rope fatigue testing machines, and non-metallic cement, soil testing instruments, and paper thickness gauges that have been successfully trial-produced and produced in small batches by this instrument factory are all precision instruments that have long been impossible to manufacture domestically. In the future, this factory will develop towards designing and trial-producing metal material testing instruments. According to the national plan, six types of metal material testing instruments can be produced in small batches this year.

Self-Made High-Manganese Alloy Steel Turnouts
Our newspaper reports: Our country's first high-manganese alloy steel frog casting has been successfully trial-produced by the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory and delivered to the Shanhai Pass Bridge Factory for assembly. After inspection by the Railway Science Research Institute, it was laid on the heavily trafficked Beijing-Hankou Railway line in December last year. According to observations, the situation is good.

In the past, the turnouts used on China's railways, with the exception of a very small number of imported turnouts with frogs made of high-manganese alloy steel and special cross-sections, were mostly composed of ordinary steel rails. This type of turnout has many structural shortcomings, the steel rails are too soft, and the economic and maintenance waste is significant.

The First Batch of New Well-Workover Rigs
Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 26th: The first batch of 80-horsepower, 8.8-ton lifting capacity well-workover rigs in our country began production at the Lanzhou General Machinery Factory in February. This was successfully trial-produced by the factory's technical personnel after designing it based on the Soviet-made well-workover rigs at the Yumen Oilfield, and it took half a year. After testing and evaluation, the output power and performance meet the requirements.

This well-workover rig is an essential and commonly used equipment in oil exploration, used for cleaning wax, pumping test oil, salvaging, and hoisting equipment up and down wells. In the past, our country could not produce it and relied entirely on imports.

Winnowing Machine and Grain Seed Selector
According to Xinhua News Agency: The local state-owned Kaifeng Machinery Factory produced and trial-produced two new products in February: a winnowing machine and a grain seed selector. The winnowing machine is modeled after the Soviet style and is very efficient. It only needs to be turned with a five-horsepower motor to winnow 20,000 catties of pure grain per hour.

The grain seed selector can select more than 4,000 catties of seeds per hour. This machine can also separate grains, beans, corn, and other particles of different sizes, weights, and lengths, and can remove impurities from the seeds. This machine has recently been successfully trial-produced.

    提高技术增加新产品
    八百马力的空气压缩机
    新华社沈阳28日电  适合我国大型厂矿通用的一种八百马力空气压缩机，最近在沈阳重型机器厂试制成功。这种空气压缩机是我国目前生产的最大一种新产品，它每分钟能输送一百立方公尺压缩空气，可以带动两吨重的气锤。
    八百马力空气压缩机结构全是新式的，并且装有很好的压力装置，可以自动控制压力和风量。使用这种大的空气压缩机，比使用规格小的空气压缩机好，效率高，还可以节省用电。
    生铁铸件上喷钢铁
    本报讯  一项新的金属喷涂技术在上钢二厂试验成功，即把钢铁喷涂在冷铸轧辊上。这是多年没有解决的问题。
    这个厂的技术人员，在上海钢铁公司中心实验室的帮助下，把钢铁喷涂在冷铸轧辊磨损的辊颈部分，再用于生产，这样就延长了轧辊的寿命，每年可节省二百只轧辊，共值七万多元。
    把金属喷涂在生铁铸件上的这一经验，可以推广到喷涂任何机械磨损部分去。
    金属硬度试验机
    新华社长春28日电  长春仪器厂试制的两台金属硬度试验机已经试制成功。
    设计工程师郑璋把标准硬度块放在试验台上，进行了表演。试验的结果，硬度值的误差不超正负一度，载荷出力误差不超过百分之正负一。它的精密度达到了国际标准。
    这个仪器厂今年在民主德国仪器制造专家具体帮助下，还将试制十吨、一百吨等四种万能材料试验机。
    硬度试验机是长春仪器厂建厂一年多来试制成功的第十种新产品。这种精密仪器是仿照德国的样品经过改进试制成功的。它对于冶金、机械工业和科学实验机关有关金属硬度的试验工作有很大作用。
    这个仪器厂先后试制成功并且小批生产的各种万能材料试验机、钢绳疲劳试验机，以及非金属的水泥、土壤试验仪器、纸张厚度计等都是国内长期不能制造的精密仪器。今后这个工厂将向着设计和试制金属材料试验仪器方向发展。按照国家计划，今年可以小批生产六种金属材料试验仪器。
  自制高锰合金钢道岔
    本报讯  我国第一个高锰合金钢辙岔铸件已由戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂试制成功，并交由山海关桥梁工厂组装，经铁道科学研究院检查后，已于去年12月份铺设在运输量较繁忙的京汉铁路线上使用。根据观察的结果，情况良好。
    过去，我国铁路上用的道岔，除极少数进口的道岔为高锰合金钢铸造的辙岔和特殊断面的辙轨外，绝大部分都是由普通钢轨组合成的。这种道岔，在结构上有很多缺点，钢轨太软，在经济上和维修上所造成的浪费很大。
    第一批新型通井机
    新华社兰州26日电  我国第一批八十匹马力、起重量为八点八吨的通井机，2月份开始在兰州通用机器厂生产。这是厂中的技术人员到玉门油矿仿照苏联造的通井机进行设计，经过半年的时间试制成功的。经过试车和鉴定，输出功率和性能，都合乎要求。
    这种通井机为石油开采中必不可少的常用设备，是供清腊、抽吸试油、打捞和井上下的起卸装置用的，过去我国不能生产，完全依靠进口。
    扬场机和谷类选种机
    据新华社讯  地方国营开封机械厂2月份生产和试制出两种新产品——扬场机和谷类选种机。扬场机是仿苏式的，生产效率很高，只要用五马力的马达拖着转动，一个小时就能扬出纯粮两万斤。
    谷类选种机一小时就能选种四千多斤。这种机器还能把麦类、豆类、玉米等大小、轻重、长短的颗粒分开，并且能清除种子当中的杂质。这种机器已经在最近试制成功。
