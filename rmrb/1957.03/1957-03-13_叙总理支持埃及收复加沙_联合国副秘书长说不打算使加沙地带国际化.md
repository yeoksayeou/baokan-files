Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, March 12th: Syrian Prime Minister Sabri al-Asali said on March 11th that Syria fully supports Egypt's position demanding the return of the Gaza Strip.

Al-Asali told a reporter from the Syrian "Al-Nour" newspaper that we are "prepared to deal with all contingencies in this regard." He said: "We are not afraid of imperialist conspiracies because we won our independence with blood and tears, and we are determined to fight to the last drop of blood to defend our independence."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 12th: UN Deputy Secretary-General Bunche said in Cairo on the evening of March 11th that the UN Emergency Force has no intention of internationalizing the Gaza Strip. He said: "The United Nations has never doubted Egypt's legitimate status over the Gaza Strip."

Bunche said that the task performed by the UN Emergency Force is to take over from the withdrawing troops, just as it has done in Port Said, El Arish, and other areas of the Sinai Peninsula. He said that the task of the UN Emergency Force is clearly defined by the resolutions of the UN General Assembly, and it will not go beyond this scope.

Bunche said that the UN Emergency Force is temporarily fully responsible for the Gaza Strip.

Bunche, accompanied by the commander of the UN Emergency Force, Burns, visited the Gaza Strip on the morning of March 11th, and made this statement to reporters after returning to Cairo that day.

During his visit to the Gaza Strip, Bunche told reporters that the UN Emergency Force is stationed in the Gaza Strip "with the very clearly defined purpose of preventing the recurrence of conflict." He said: "We are stationed here with the consent of the Egyptian government, and we are working on this basis."

    叙总理支持埃及收复加沙
    联合国副秘书长说不打算使加沙地带国际化
    新华社12日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚总理萨布里·阿萨利3月11日说，叙利亚全力支持埃及要求收还加沙地带的立场。
    阿萨利对叙利亚“火炬报”的记者说，我们“准备对付这方面的一切不测事件”。他说：“我们不怕帝国主义的阴谋，因为我们用血和泪赢得了独立，我们决心为保卫独立而战斗到最后一滴血。”
    新华社开罗12日电　联合国副秘书长本奇3月11日晚间在开罗说，联合国紧急部队并不打算使加沙地带国际化。他说：“联合国从来没有怀疑过埃及对加沙地带的合法地位”。
    本奇说，联合国紧急部队所执行的任务是从撤退的军队那里进行接管，正像它在塞得港、阿里希和西奈半岛的其他地区执行的任务一样。他说，联合国紧急部队的任务由联合国大会的决议明确规定，它不会越过这个范围。
    本奇说，联合国紧急部队暂时对加沙地带负完全的责任。
    本奇在3月11日上午由联合国紧急部队司令伯恩斯陪同访问了加沙地带，他在当天回到开罗后向新闻记者发表了这个声明。
    本奇在访问加沙地带时曾经对新闻记者说，联合国紧急部队是“抱着防止冲突再起的规定得十分明确的宗旨”而驻在加沙地带的，他说：“我们是在埃及政府同意的基础上驻在这里的，我们在这个基础上进行工作。”
