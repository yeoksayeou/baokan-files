    North China Agricultural Science Institute
    Symposium on Collection of Farmers' Crop Varieties

    (Our report) The North China Agricultural Science Institute recently convened relevant personnel from the agricultural science research institutes of Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, and Henan provinces to discuss the collection, preservation, and organization of farmers' crop varieties in the North China region. Agricultural science research institutes in the Northeast, Northwest, East China, Central China, South China, and Southwest regions, as well as the Ministry of Agriculture and the agricultural departments of Hebei and Shandong provinces, also sent representatives to participate in the symposium.

    The symposium first analyzed the collection, organization, and preservation status of farmers' varieties in the North China provinces. The Yellow River basin is the region with the longest agricultural history in China, with abundant crop types and variety quantities. These varieties are all valuable resources carefully cultivated and tested by Chinese farmers in long-term production practices, and are indispensable research materials for future agricultural breeding work. After agricultural cooperativization, the crops managed and the varieties used by agricultural cooperatives are becoming increasingly simplified, and a large number of farmers' varieties have been eliminated. For example, there were 212 farmers' varieties in the Linyi Shuhe area of Shandong Province, and 60 of them can no longer be collected. If these variety materials are lost, it will cause irreparable losses to future variety breeding work. The North China provinces began collecting farmers' varieties in the spring of last year, and although 12,964 varieties have been collected so far, this includes many duplicate varieties, which is still far from the task of comprehensive collection. The symposium believes that to do this work well, it is necessary for the Party, government, and technology departments of each province to attach importance to it. In terms of practice, the provincial agricultural departments should be responsible, with the county as the unit, and organize the strength of the extension stations to vigorously carry out collection work. The experimental research departments should actively assist the administrative organs in implementing the technical measures in the collection work. The collection targets include 59 crops, including food, industrial raw materials, oil crops, and vegetables. The symposium also put forward plans for seed specifications, collection quantities, and collection steps. (Zhu Fengsui)

    华北农业科学研究所
    座谈农家作物品种征集工作
    本报讯  华北农业科学研究所最近召集了河北、山西、山东、河南四省农业科学研究所有关人员，座谈华北地区作物农家品种的征集、保存与整理工作。东北、西北、华东、华中、华南、西南等农业科学研究所，农业部和河北、山东两省农业厅也都派代表参加座谈。
    座谈会首先分析了华北各省农家品种的征集与整理保存情况。黄河流域是我国农业历史最悠久的地区，作物种类及品种数量都很丰富。这些品种都是我国农民在长期生产实践中慎重培育和久经考验过的珍贵资源，是今后农业选种工作上不可少的研究材料。在农业合作化以后，农业社经营的作物和采用的品种日趋简化，大量的农家品种已被淘汰。如山东省临沂沭河区农家品种有二百一十二种，现已有六十种征集不到。这些品种材料如再丢失，将给今后的品种选育工作造成不可弥补的损失。华北各省去年春季开始征集农家品种，目前虽已征集到一万二千九百六十四个，但包括很多重复品种，距离全面征集的任务还很远。座谈会认为要把这项工作做好，必须各省的党、政、技术三方面都加以重视。在作法上应由省农业厅负责，以县为单位，组织推广站的力量，大力展开征集工作。试验研究部门要主动协助行政机关贯彻征集工作中的技术措施。征集对象包括粮食、工业原料、油料、蔬菜等五十九种作物。座谈会对种子规格、征集数量和征集步骤等也都提出了方案。 （朱凤绥）
