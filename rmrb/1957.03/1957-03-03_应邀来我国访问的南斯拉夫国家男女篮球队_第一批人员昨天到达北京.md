    Yugoslav National Men's and Women's Basketball Teams Arrive in China for a Visit: First Group Arrived in Beijing Yesterday

    Xinhua News Agency, March 2nd - The first group of sixteen members of the Yugoslav National Men's and Women's Basketball Teams, who were invited to visit China, arrived in Beijing by plane this afternoon. This is the second sports team from Yugoslavia to visit China, following the visit of the Yugoslav Youth Football Team in January last year.

    The Yugoslav National Men's and Women's Basketball Teams consist of thirty-two people, led by Danilo Knezevic, Chairman of the Yugoslav Basketball Association. When their first group arrived at the airport today, they were welcomed by Dong Shouyi, Chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association, and Chinese male and female basketball players. Their second group of sixteen members will arrive on the 3rd.

    The Yugoslav National Men's and Women's Basketball Teams include thirteen male and thirteen female athletes each. The men's team, which just arrived today, went to the Beijing Gymnasium for practice that evening. The men's team includes center Delmastija, who is two meters and four centimeters tall. Although the men's team did not rank in the top six in the 1955 European Championships, they defeated the Czechoslovakian men's basketball team, which won the European runner-up, with a score of 52 to 49 in that tournament. According to Ja. Nikolic, the coach of the men's team who arrived today, the Yugoslav National Women's Basketball Team ranked ninth among the seventeen women's basketball teams participating in the European Championships. The average height of the players is one meter and sixty-seven centimeters, and the tallest player, Karusevic (one meter and seventy-eight centimeters tall), has won the Yugoslav women's javelin championship for three consecutive years.

    The Yugoslav National Men's and Women's Basketball Teams will visit China for a month, preparing to hold nine friendly matches (eighteen games) with the Chinese men's and women's basketball teams in Beijing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Tianjin. The schedule for the three friendly matches (six games) to be held in Beijing has been tentatively determined:
