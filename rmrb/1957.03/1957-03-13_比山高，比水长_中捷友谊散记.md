Higher Than Mountains, Longer Than Rivers
——Notes on Sino-Czechoslovak Friendship
By Our Correspondent Lǐ Yánníng

Last December, when the delegation of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China was on a friendly visit to Czechoslovakia, Deputy Head of the Delegation Li Jishen once said that the friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak people is higher than the snow-capped Tatra Mountains and longer than the Danube River, which flows through seven countries.

During our stay in Czechoslovakia, we often felt the deep brotherly feelings that the Czechoslovak people harbored towards the Chinese people, even in some very small matters.

Once, we visited the Gottwald Mausoleum in Prague and walked out onto the square in front of the mausoleum. I took out a match to light a cigarette. At this moment, a middle-aged woman walked up from the side, and she asked with a smile, "Are you Chinese?" while taking out a box of matches and handing it to me. At first, I was a little confused. After my companion translated, I realized that she wanted to exchange my box of Chinese matches in order to keep it as a souvenir. Of course, I immediately complied with her request, and she shook hands with us and happily returned to her companions. They were a group of visitors, and judging from their clothes, they were obviously on a group trip to Prague from other places.

Such things often happened in our office as well: the doorbell rang, and when you went to open the door, you found that the person standing in front of you was a little guest, a Czechoslovak child. He raised his head and said politely, "Good day," and then asked hopefully, "Can you give me a Chinese stamp?"

A Chinese stamp or a Chinese matchbox would sometimes become a "treasure" of Czechoslovak friends. These seemingly small things vividly demonstrated their deep friendship towards New China.

"Are you Chinese?" This is an extremely common question.

But behind this question, there is often an interesting story. A young Chinese comrade working in Prague told me: once he was traveling by train, and after getting on the train, he sat next to an elderly peasant woman. This wrinkled Czechoslovak old lady was eating the hard-boiled eggs she had brought with her. She asked, "Are you Chinese?" Then they talked a few sentences. Along the way, they greeted each other with smiles. When it was time to get off the train, this Chinese comrade suddenly found a hard-boiled egg in his raincoat pocket. He didn't know when the old lady had put it there.

I myself also had an interesting encounter once, when I was covering the World Student Representatives Conference last year. I was sitting on a bench resting during a recess. A Czechoslovak youth I had never met before walked up, greeted me, and then enthusiastically asked, "Are you a Chinese comrade?"

In less than five minutes, we were like friends. From the conversation, I learned that he was a lecturer at a university in Prague, teaching mathematics, and he also had Chinese students among his students. He was a temporary staff member hired for the conference. He told me that he was learning Chinese in night school; then he spoke a few sentences in broken Chinese and asked me if his pronunciation was correct. In the evening, we happened to meet again in one place. He took out an exercise book and showed it to me. On it, he had written many Chinese characters in a crooked manner, with the pronunciation and explanation in Czech next to each character. He opened the next page, pointed to a few lines of Chinese characters and said, "I don't understand what these mean, can you explain them to me?" I followed his finger, and to be honest, for the first second I almost burst out laughing. It turned out that those few lines of words were "Precious Collection of Jiao Yan Shan Fang," "Made by Lao Hu Kaiwen," etc. Obviously, they were copied from a piece of Chinese black ink, no wonder he couldn't easily understand them. But my mood immediately turned to solemn respect. I couldn't help but look at his face, which was an extremely cheerful and studious face.

I explained it to him in detail, he nodded, put away the exercise book, and said, "Chinese characters are really not easy to learn! But if I learn them well, I can understand many things about China." He told me that he knew Russian, English, and German, but Chinese was the most difficult language for him. Then, he raised a question: "I heard that China is going to carry out a reform of the written language and no longer use square characters. Why is that?" I explained it, and he nodded and said, "I see, that's right. But you know, how much I like these square characters!"

Even now, I often think of this Czechoslovak friend who is diligently learning the Chinese language, which is both difficult to understand and dear to his heart.

Not many days ago, we went to the village of Straki, about forty kilometers from Prague, to attend the annual meeting of an agricultural producers' cooperative. We went as news reporters. But from the cooperative's chairman to the male and female production team members, they didn't care about that. They seemed to welcome us as representatives of the People's China. Sumptuous food filled our stomachs, and enthusiastic words surrounded us. The head of the cooperative's chicken farm gave me a photo of the chickens and a photo of himself. A member who had a penchant for collecting stamps and old banknotes brought several large albums from home, insisting that we admire his collection. People who spoke at the annual meeting, in addition to expressing their opinions on their cooperative affairs, also had to express a warm welcome to the Chinese guests. A thin and tall old man, who was responsible for cleaning the cows, excitedly shouted "Long live People's China". After the meeting, this old man held my hand tightly, his face flushed with excitement. He said, "I never dreamed that Chinese guests would come to our cooperative." An army officer from a nearby garrison who attended the cooperative's annual meeting also repeatedly asked us: "Come to our garrison next time, and tell the soldiers about New China."

They asked us about all sorts of things about China, from the Chinese people's resistance to Japanese and American aggression to the current production and life of Chinese peasants. A young girl asked what the Chinese peasants planted. When I mentioned that many Chinese peasants grew rice, she said bluntly, "Then your peasants must buy a lot of long rubber boots." I told her that the peasants in old China were very poor, and their lives had greatly improved after liberation, but they were not as wealthy as the Czechoslovak peasants and could not afford to wear long rubber boots to work in the paddy fields. She smiled embarrassedly, nodded and said, "But they will definitely become richer in the future."

Yes, the Czechoslovak people care about the Chinese people, hope that we will achieve greater achievements, and are happy for our every achievement. I also remember the kind and humble remarks of Comrade Strechaj, Chairman of the Slovak Administrative Committee, when the delegation of the National People's Congress visited Slovakia. When introducing Slovakia's agricultural collectivization work, he said, "In terms of agricultural collectivization, we cannot tell you that we have achieved as much as China, so we carefully study and research every decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in this regard in order to accelerate the speed of agricultural collectivization." He asked the comrades of the delegation what the recent percentage of agricultural collectivization in China was, and a member replied that it had reached more than 90%. Comrade Strechaj said humorously: "Then there is no other way, only to congratulate you."

I also remember that when the delegation said goodbye to the Czechoslovak National Assembly, many Chinese delegates praised the great achievements of Czechoslovak socialist construction. At that time, Comrade Fierlinger, Chairman of the National Assembly, said sincerely: "There is no end to progress, the important thing is to keep moving forward, and China has a great momentum for continuous progress." That evening, when delivering a speech at the reception at the Chinese Embassy, ​​he said it again in the same way.

This kind of enthusiastic encouragement for the Chinese people moved every Chinese comrade present very much.

Now the delegation of the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic headed by Premier Široký has come to visit China, and Sino-Czechoslovak friendship will undoubtedly be further deepened. Premier Široký and other comrades of the delegation will have the opportunity to see with their own eyes the same deep feelings of the Chinese people for the Czechoslovak people, to see their concern for the Czechoslovak people's construction achievements, and to see their importance and enthusiastic learning of the Czechoslovak people's various experiences.

    比山高，比水长
    ——中捷友谊散记
    本报记者　李延宁
    去年12月，当中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会代表团在捷克斯洛伐克作友好访问的时候，副团长李济深有一次曾说，中捷人民的友谊比那终年白雪皑皑的塔特拉山还高，比那流经七个国家的多瑙河还长。
    在捷克斯洛伐克居住的日子里，我们经常感到捷克斯洛伐克人民对中国人民所怀抱的深厚的兄弟感情，即使是在一些很小的事情上。
    有一次，我们参观了布拉格的哥特瓦尔德陵墓出来，走到陵墓前的广场上。我掏出火柴点了一枝烟。这时忽然从旁边走来了一位中年妇女，她满面笑容地问道：“你是中国人吗？”一面掏出一匣火柴送到我的面前。最初我不免有些摸不着头脑，经过同伴的翻译才知道：原来她希望交换我的那匣中国火柴，把它保存下来当纪念品。当然，我马上满足了她的要求，于是她和我们握了握手，高高兴兴地回到她的同伴们那里去了。那是一群参观者，从服装上看来，显然是从外地到布拉格来作集体旅行的。
    在我们的办公处也常常会发生这样的事情：门铃响了，你走去开开门，发现站在你面前的原来是位小客人，一个捷克斯洛伐克的小朋友。他仰起头挺有礼貌地说了声“日安”，然后满怀希望地问道：“你能给我一张中国邮票吗？”
    一张中国邮票或一个中国火柴匣，有时也会成为捷克斯洛伐克朋友的“珍藏”。这些看来很小的事情，却生动地表现了他们对新中国深厚友情。
    “你是中国人吗？”这是一句极为普通的问话。
    但是在这句问话后面，往往就是个有趣的故事。一个在布拉格工作的中国青年同志告诉我：一次他乘火车旅行，上车后坐在一位年老的农妇旁边，这位满面皱纹的捷克斯洛伐克老太太正在吃着她随身携带的煮鸡蛋。她问道：“你是中国人吗？”接着他们交谈了几句。一路上，他们互相以微笑致意。到下车的时候，这位中国同志忽然在雨衣口袋里发现了一个煮鸡蛋，不知这位老太太是什么时候给他放进去的。
    我自己也有过一次有趣的遭遇，那是去年采访世界学生代表大会的时候。我在休会时坐在一张长椅上休息。走来了一位素不相识的捷克斯洛伐克青年人，他打了招呼之后，便热情地问道：“你是中国同志吗？”
    不到五分钟，我们就像朋友一样了。从交谈中知道，他是布拉格一所大学的讲师，教数学，在他的学生中也有中国留学生。他是大会临时请来的工作人员。他告诉我，他正在夜校里学中文；接着便用不熟练的中国话讲了几句，并且问我发音是否正确。晚上，我们碰巧又在一个地方相遇，他掏出一本练习簿给我看，在这上面歪歪斜斜地写了许多中国字，每个字后面都用捷文注着读音和解释。他翻开后面一页，指着几行中国字说：“我不明白这些是什么意思，你能给我讲讲吗？”我顺着他的手指看去，说真的，最初一秒钟我几乎要大笑起来，原来那几行字是“蕉烟山房珍藏”、“老胡开文监制”之类，显然是从一块中国黑墨上抄下来的，难怪他不易理解了。但我的心情立刻就变为肃然起敬了，我不由得看了看他的脸，那是一张极为开朗的好学不倦的脸。
    我对他详细地解释了一遍，他点点头，把练习簿收了起来，说：“中国文字真不容易学啊！可是如果我学好了，我就可以懂得许多中国的事情了。”他告诉我，他懂俄文、英文、德文，但是中文对他来说是最难的一种文字了。接着，他提出了一个问题：“听说中国要实行文字改革，不用方块字了，这是为什么呢？”我作了说明，他点头说：“原来如此，这是对的。但是你知道，我是多么喜欢这方块字呀！”
    到现在我还常常想到这位孜孜不倦地学着他既难懂而又心爱的中文的捷克斯洛伐克朋友。
    不多几天以前，我们到距布拉格约四十公里的斯特拉基村参加农业生产合作社的年会。我们是作为新闻记者去采访的。但是从合作社社长到男女生产队员却不管这一点，他们仿佛把我们当作人民中国的代表来欢迎。丰盛的食品把我们的胃装满了，热情的话语把我们包围了。合作社的养鸡场长把鸡的照片和他自己的照片送给我。一个有收集邮票和旧钞票癖好的社员，从家里抱来了几大本册子，一定要我们欣赏一下他的珍藏。在年会上发言的人除了对他们的社务发表意见以外，都要向中国客人表示热烈欢迎。一个瘦而高的老人，是负责牛的清洁工作的，激动地高呼 “人民中国万岁”。会后这位老人又紧紧地握着我的手，兴奋得满脸通红，他说：“我做梦也没有想到会有中国客人来到我们的合作社。”从邻近驻地来列席合作社年会的一位驻军军官，也再三要求我们：“下次到我们驻地来吧，来给士兵们讲讲新中国。”
    他们向我们打听各种各样的关于中国的事情，从中国人民抵抗日本侵略和美国侵略的情形到目前中国农民的生产和生活。一位青年姑娘问中国农民种植什么东西，当我谈到很多中国农民种稻的时候，她爽直地说：“那么你们农民要买很多长统胶靴了。”我告诉她，旧中国农民很穷，解放后生活大大改善了，但是还不像捷克斯洛伐克农民那样富裕，还不可能穿了长统胶靴下水田。她不好意思地笑了，点点头说：“但是以后一定会更富裕起来的。”
    是的，捷克斯洛伐克人民关怀着中国人民，希望我们取得更大的成就，并为我们的每一个成就而高兴。我还记得全国人民代表大会代表团访问斯洛伐克时，斯洛伐克行政委员会主席斯特雷哈伊同志的亲切而谦虚的谈话。他在介绍斯洛伐克的农业合作化工作时说，“我们在农业合作化方面，还不能告诉你们说已像中国那样成就巨大，因此中共中央这方面的每一个决议我们都用心学习、研究，以求加快农业合作化的速度。”他问代表团的同志最近中国农业合作化的百分比是多少，一个团员回答说已达90％以上了。斯特雷哈伊同志诙谐地说：“那没有别的办法，只有祝贺你们了。”
    我也记得，在代表团到捷克斯洛伐克国民议会辞行的时候，不少中国代表纷纷赞扬捷克斯洛伐克社会主义建设的巨大成就。当时国民议会主席费林格同志诚恳地说：“进步是没有止境的，重要的是要不断前进，而中国向前不断进步的劲头是很大的。”当天晚上，在中国大使馆的招待会上致词时，他又照这个意思再说了一遍。
    这种对于中国人民的热情鼓励，使在场的每个中国同志都非常感动。
    现在以西罗基总理为首的捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团已经到中国访问，中捷友谊无疑又将进一步加深。西罗基总理和代表团其他同志将有机会亲眼看到中国人民对捷克斯洛伐克人民的同样深厚的感情，看到他们对捷克斯洛伐克人民建设成就的关怀，看到他们对捷克斯洛伐克人民各方面经验的重视和热心学习。（附图片）
