Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 22nd - The Mulam people, who live in the Luocheng County of Guangxi Province, celebrated their traditional Spring Social Festival on March 17th with zongzi and wine. Immediately following, they began spring plowing activities to cultivate early rice seedlings.

Luocheng County is China's only Mulam autonomous region. The county has a population of 10,000 Mulam people, who traditionally rely on farming for their livelihoods in the thirty-six townships surrounding the county seat.

Currently, with the exception of a few individual Mulam farming households, the rest have joined advanced agricultural cooperatives. The entire region has thirty-five Mulam agricultural cooperatives and thirty-seven ethnic joint cooperatives with Mulam participation. Last year, after the Mulam farmers achieved advanced cooperativization, most cooperatives still increased their production despite experiencing an unprecedented severe drought in decades. Due to increased agricultural and sideline production in Rongshan Cooperative of Long'an District, the cooperative's public accumulation reached more than 14,000 yuan in one year, with an average of 120 yuan per household. The Zhangluo Mulam Agricultural Cooperative, which was considered the most severely drought-stricken in the county, increased production by 51% last year, with 80% of its members increasing production and income.

The Mulam people have a history of six to seven hundred years and have their own language – the Mulam language. According to elders, when they first migrated to Luocheng, it was a wilderness of barren mountains. Through generations of diligent cultivation, it has now been transformed into rice paddies and cultivated land connecting fields. In the past, these fields were prone to drought and reduced yields due to a lack of water sources. After advanced cooperativization, the Siba District alone constructed 217 water conservancy projects, turning more than 16,000 mu of "fields relying on heaven" into irrigated land.

This year, the Mulam area has expanded the early rice acreage by 23,000 mu. An average of ten loads of fertilizer are being applied per mu of early rice paddy being sown. All are using lime selection, thus changing the backward production habits of Mulam farmers who have always believed in "farming without fertilizer, only needing large pockets." Agricultural cooperativization has produced eight to nine hundred Mulam agricultural cooperative management cadres and production team leaders.

Currently, every agricultural cooperative has a Party branch, and 348 Mulam Party members are leading all members to launch a labor emulation campaign and strive for a bumper harvest this year.

### 我国唯一的仫佬族聚居区　广西罗城实现了农业合作化

　　我国唯一的仫佬族聚居区
　　广西罗城实现了农业合作化
    据新华社南宁22日讯　聚居在广西省罗城县的仫佬族人民，在3月17日用粽粑和酒肉欢度他们传统的春社节之后，立即开始了早稻育秧的春耕活动。
    罗城县是我国唯一的仫佬族聚居区，全县有仫佬族人民一万人，在县城周围的三十六个乡，他们一向是靠种田为生。
    目前除个别的几户仫佬族农民外，其余的全部参加了高级农业社。全区共有仫佬族农业社三十五个，有仫佬族参加的民族联合社三十七个。去年仫佬族农民实现了高级合作化之后，虽然受到几十年所未有的严重旱灾，但大部分社仍然增加了产量。龙岸区榕山社由于农副业增产，一年内社里的公共积累达到一万四千多元，每户平均能得到一百二十元。被认为全县旱灾特别严重的章罗仫佬族农业社，去年增产51％，有80％的社员增产增收。
    仫佬族人民已有六、七百年的历史，有着本民族的言语——仫佬话。据老年人介绍，他们刚迁来罗城时，这里还是一片荒山野岭，经过一代代勤恳培植，现在已经变成阡陌相连的稻田、畬地。这些田地，过去因水源缺少，很易受旱减产，高级合作化以后，仅四把区一个区就兴修水利二百一十七处，使一万六千多亩“望天田”变成了水浇田。
    今年仫佬族地区共扩大早稻面积二万三千亩。正在播种的早稻田平均每亩施肥十担。全部采用石灰选种，因而改变了仫佬族农民一向“种田不用粪、只要大兜顿”的落后生产习惯。农业合作化涌现出八、九百名仫佬族的农业社管理干部和生产队长。
    现在每个农业社都有一个党支部，三百四十八个仫佬族党员带动全体社员开展劳动竞赛运动、争取今年的农业大丰收。
