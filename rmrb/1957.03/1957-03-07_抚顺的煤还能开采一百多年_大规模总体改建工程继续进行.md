According to the Liaoning Daily, after large-scale geological drilling in the past few years, it has been confirmed that the coal reserves in the Fushun coalfield are still abundant. According to the Fushun Mining Bureau's coal output this year, mining can continue for more than a century. In order to develop underground resources, Fushun will continue to carry out large-scale overall reconstruction of coal mines this year.

	Fushun Coal Mine's main construction projects this year include: two huge open-pit mines, existing mines, shaft extension projects, and the construction of a complex transportation network within the mining area. The new construction, reconstruction, and expansion of this batch of projects will enable the Fushun Coal Mine, located in the Northeast industrial center, to play a greater role as a "pioneer industry" during the second and third five-year plans.

	Fushun Coal Mine is a super-gassy mine, and the coalfield is covered with billions of tons of oil shale. Building open-pit mines or shafts in Fushun can "kill two birds with one stone," simultaneously extracting two resources. The two open-pit mines under construction will also extract a large amount of oil shale to support the development of the synthetic petroleum industry. After all the existing mines that have begun to develop deep coalfields have fully developed new coal mining areas underground in a few years, they will produce more than one million tons of power coal and coking coal per year than at present.

	In order to meet the needs of coal mine infrastructure construction, Fushun mining area has 77 transportation projects this year. A total of more than 40 kilometers of electrified railways will be built within the year, and new traffic lines and stations will also be laid.

### 抚顺的煤还能开采一百多年  大规模总体改建工程继续进行

    抚顺的煤还能开采一百多年
    大规模总体改建工程继续进行
    据辽宁日报讯　经过过去几年大规模的地质钻探证实，抚顺煤田蕴藏量仍然丰富，据抚顺矿务局今年的煤产量计算，还可以继续开采一世纪以上。为了开发地下富源，抚顺今年将继续进行大规模的煤矿总体改建。
    抚顺煤矿今年主要的建设工程有：两座巨大的露天矿、现有矿井、井筒延深工程和矿区内复杂的运输网建设。这批工程的新建、改建和扩建，使位于东北工业中心的抚顺煤矿，在第二、第三个五年计划期间将发挥更大的“先行工业”的作用。
    抚顺煤矿是超级瓦斯矿，煤田上部又覆盖着几十亿吨的油母页岩，在抚顺建设露天矿或者矿井，都可以“一箭双雕”，同时开采两种资源。建设中的两个露天矿还将采掘出大量油母页岩，支援人造石油工业的发展。已经开始开发深部煤田的现有矿井，若干年后在井下全部开拓出新采煤区域时，每年将比现在多生产一百多万吨动力煤和炼焦煤。
    为了适应煤矿基本建设的需要，抚顺矿区今年的运输工程有七十七项，年内共将修建电气化铁路四十多公里，新的交通干线、车站也要铺设起来。
