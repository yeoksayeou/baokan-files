Using Modern Scientific Methods to Study Traditional Chinese Medicine
　　Shi Jinmo Suggests Establishing a Specialized Institution within the Chinese Academy of Sciences

Traditional Chinese medicine, which was almost abandoned during the rule of the reactionary government, has been revived after liberation under the correct policy directives of the Chinese Communist Party. Moreover, with the strong support of the People's Government and the efforts of the masses, the infinite treasures of traditional Chinese medicine have been unearthed in recent years, showing infinitely bright prospects. To realize this prospect, it is necessary to study the scientific principles of traditional Chinese medicine and explain it with modern science. Therefore, an institution should be established within the Academy of Sciences specifically for research on the theoretical principles of traditional Chinese medicine. My reasons are explained in four parts:

　　I

There are two theoretical systems in China's medical community. One is traditional Chinese medicine, which has been around for thousands of years, and the other is Western medicine, which was introduced from the West in the early 18th century. One talks about qi transformation, and the other talks about cells. The two theoretical systems are different, and contradictions certainly exist. We know that in the past, Western medicine was shrouded in idealistic and metaphysical thinking. Based on Virchow's cellular pathology, it regarded various bodily reactions as the mechanical sum of independent reactions of individual cells, isolating each part. The theories resulting from this incorrect medical view also led to incorrect treatments. It was not until Pavlov's theory—the theory that the organism is a complete and unified whole—was valued that physiology shone with new brilliance. The introduction of Pavlov's theory into China also promoted the rapid advancement of China's medicine, because his theory is based on dialectical materialism and meets the needs of the people of socialist countries. However, our traditional Chinese medicine, which has been around for thousands of years, has long regarded the human body as a complete and unified organism. According to reliable medical books, this theory existed as early as the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods more than 500 years BC. However, limited by ancient objective conditions, it was not explained by physics, chemistry, cells, etc., but by Yin and Yang, exterior and interior, the Five Elements, and the Six Qi to explain the unity and integrity of the organism. It was truly great to have such insights thousands of years ago. This holism has been supporting the advancement of Chinese medicine. Unfortunately, some Taoist metaphysics were added to it in the past dynasties, which made modern people think that traditional Chinese medicine is unscientific and a product of idealism, and even that it has no research value. In addition, Western medicine, which was shrouded in idealistic and metaphysical thinking in the past, regarded the parts as isolated, and of course, it was incompatible with the holistic view. At the same time, traditional Chinese medicine itself has very little creativity and cannot explain ancient principles with modern science. As a result, the brilliant achievements of traditional Chinese medicine were not only not carried forward, but were also destroyed by the reactionary rulers and became increasingly buried. Fortunately, the Chinese Communist Party and the wise Chairman Mao issued the call to promote traditional Chinese medicine, which made traditional Chinese medicine reappear in the light.

In addition to the holism of traditional Chinese medicine, as we all know, modern Pavlov's theory recognizes the unity and integrity of the organism. However, it is different from the holism of traditional Chinese medicine. Pavlov's theory focuses on nerve reflexes, and the function of the two hemispheres of the brain dominates everything. Traditional Chinese medicine is not like this, but uses the Five Elements, mutual generation and restraint, and the Yin and Yang of exterior and interior to represent the relationship of circulation and contradiction. In summary, both talk about the whole, but the statements are different. In fact, the theory of holism is comprehensive and in line with the laws of dialectical materialism, so Pavlov's theory and traditional Chinese medicine theory are likely to merge together to become a more perfect holism.

　　II

Since traditional Chinese medicine has a history of thousands of years and has undeniable curative effects, does traditional Chinese medicine only have experience and no theory? Although we cannot deny that traditional Chinese medicine is the accumulation of thousands of years of experience, we cannot ignore that experience must be raised to the level of theory to a certain extent, and then return to practice from theory, constantly circulating and repeatedly innovating, which is progress and development. If traditional Chinese medicine only has experience and no theory, I don't think traditional Chinese medicine would have survived to this day. The problem is that the theory of traditional Chinese medicine has not been explained by modern science, so it is considered to be metaphysics. This view is the result of not conducting in-depth research on traditional Chinese medicine.

The sages of traditional Chinese medicine have found out the relationship between the various organs in practical experience, and realized that they are not isolated from each other, but are interconnected and mutually restricted, and that the external environment will affect them. However, in the case of the lack of ancient science, they found out the relationship between organs and the impact of the external world on the body by using the Five Elements, mutual generation and restraint, and the Yin and Yang of exterior and interior, and demonstrated that the body is unified and complete.

We must look at the problem from the perspective of historical development. Taking Western medicine as an example, ancient Greece also used wind, fire, water, and earth to view the human body, and later evolved into chemistry. Without the process of Virchow's cellular pathology, it would be difficult to jump from the theory of spiritual source of disease to Pavlov's theory. Traditional Chinese medicine is also limited by historical objective conditions. The theory of traditional Chinese medicine is also a simple dialectical materialism. Although we know that physiology is not algebra, we cannot say that it is absolutely unreasonable. Therefore, I believe that the treasure of traditional Chinese medicine is not limited to valuable experience, but also contains theoretical data of physiology and pathophysiology that modern medicine has not yet talked about.

　　III

Due to the treasures of traditional Chinese medicine, it is not only limited to clinical experience, but also contains extremely rich materials in terms of physiology and pathophysiology. In particular, the relationship between the internal organs understood by traditional Chinese medicine in practice has not yet been discussed by modern medicine. For example, traditional Chinese medicine believes that the lung does not exist in isolation between the internal organs, but has a relationship of mutual generation with the kidney and spleen, and a relationship of mutual restraint with the liver and heart; it also says that the lung governs the skin and hair, and the lung opens into the nose, etc. A lung is related to so many parts, but this kind of statement has not been seen in modern medicine. However, these relationships are not fabricated out of thin air, but are found in clinical practice. In treatment, we also believe that if the lung is diseased, we do not simply treat the lung, but observe its generation and restraint, examine its exterior and interior, comprehensively analyze it, and treat its origin. Judging from the curative effect, it is not unreasonable. However, although the ancients could appreciate the relationship between them in practical observation, they could not explain it according to modern scientific principles due to the objective conditions at the time, that is to say, they had a direction but did not explain in detail which road to take and how to take it. For example, the Inner Canon says: "The lung governs the skin and hair," and we also know clinically that the lung is related to the skin and hair. But how to explain it? The ancients explained it like this: "The metal qi is firm, and the skin is also like this. The lung corresponds to metal, so it is combined with the skin." I don't think this explanation clearly explains the ultimate relationship between them. To clarify the relationship between them, we can only explain it through experiments and modern scientific principles. This will expand the fields of physiology and pathophysiology. Therefore, there will be a wider range of new ways in diagnosis and treatment, and the solution of diseases will be faster. This new physiology and pathophysiology is a unique medicine in the new China that has never existed before, making traditional Chinese medicine occupy an important position in the international arena; it is also to unify the two different theories of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, like Pavlov's theory, which will affect the international medical system and write a brilliant page in the history of modern medicine, and complete the task assigned to us by the Party to "promote traditional Chinese medicine with modern science."

Therefore, we should not only study traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions and treatments, but also study the physiology and pathophysiology of traditional Chinese medicine. That is to say, we should not only discover it, but also promote it.

Using modern science to study the physiology and pathophysiology of traditional Chinese medicine is the way to promote traditional Chinese medicine. This should be one of the tasks of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, just like the research of Pavlov's theory in the Soviet Academy of Sciences. This is a work to make traditional Chinese medicine catch up with the international level, which is arduous and requires a long period of time. Therefore, it is necessary to gather a large number of people, especially those who already have a modern medical foundation and have a considerable understanding of traditional Chinese medicine, to concentrate and give play to the collective strength to conduct research. We should also hire old traditional Chinese medicine practitioners with expertise as consultants, so as to closely link theory with practice. As for the research method, it should be mainly experimental, focusing on in vivo experiments, and using actual patients as a control. We cannot depart from the position, viewpoint and method of dialectical materialism, and should strictly adhere to the analysis starting from physiology, and pure objectivity, starting from the outside, and then systematize the whole problem. The unified theory can be the norm for future medical students, so that Chinese medicine is no longer divided into traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, bridging the gap between the theories of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and achieving the goal of uniting traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. Everyone who has studied this theory is a doctor who is proficient in both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. This creative new Chinese medicine is a unique Chinese medicine based on dialectical materialism.

　　IV

In order to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, the Ministry of Health established the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Since there is already the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, is it not necessary to set up another Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Theory in the Chinese Academy of Sciences? To clarify this issue, we must distinguish between "concrete practical work of society" and "theoretical research work of natural science." These two tasks are equally arduous. If one institution is responsible for them, it will be a bit too heavy. In order to adapt to the speed of socialist construction, the two sides should advance side by side and cooperate with each other. The Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine is doing concrete practical work for society, such as: historical sorting, collection of medical books and prescriptions, compilation of textbooks, summary and promotion of treatment experience, treatment and discussion of difficult and complicated diseases, development of acupuncture, and identification of Chinese medicine, etc., but using modern science to study and explain the physiology and pathophysiology of traditional Chinese medicine, creatively promoting traditional Chinese medicine, reaching the international level and becoming the theoretical system of unique Chinese medicine, should be undertaken by another institution set up by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This is not only an internal problem of Chinese medicine, but will affect the world medical system. This kind of work is also indispensable to the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Moreover, in traditional Chinese medicine's theory of the Five Elements, among the hundreds of thousands of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, the number of proponents and opponents is about half; for many years, they have been arguing with each other, and there is no consensus. Traditional Chinese medicine itself has contradictions. If a unified principle is not obtained, all problems will be more difficult to solve, and it is impossible to determine which is right and which is wrong. It must be thoroughly studied, and modern scientific truth must be used to accurately prove it, determine its value, and then we can achieve unity and convince people. This kind of work cannot be solved through consultation and cooperation, and only the Chinese Academy of Sciences is the most appropriate institution to undertake this work.

The Party calls on us to march towards science. In order to overfulfill the twelve-year plan, it is even more necessary to set up a special research institution in the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Especially when the number of researchers is gradually increasing, and the predecessors of traditional Chinese medicine with rich experience are gradually aging, if we wait until they have all passed away, even if there is such an institution, there will be no one to preside over it. The opportunity must not be missed, and it is not too late to prepare now. Professor Vagramik of the Soviet Union said: To study traditional Chinese medicine, there must be a sound organizational structure and leadership structure. This sentence is very correct, and I completely agree with this statement, and we should also adopt this opinion.

As we all know, all scientific research work is concentrated in the Chinese Academy of Sciences. There are dozens of research institutes in the academy, many of which are researching the national heritage. Since traditional Chinese medicine has been recognized as one of the national heritages, it has been excluded from the system of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Since this is the case, why set up one or two idle academicians in the academy? Marxism-Leninism teaches us to "seek truth from facts." May I ask whether one or two academicians can bear this arduous research work? Giving play to the collective creative ability is the proper way to study science. We must not think that we can be satisfied with the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine and shirk responsibility. Because the research purposes of the two are different, as mentioned above.

In order to promote the valuable products left by our motherland, and make it a unique medical theoretical system in China in addition to the concrete practical work, we should establish a specialized research institution in the Chinese Academy of Sciences—the Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Theory.

    用现代科学方法研究祖国医学
　　施今墨建议在中国科学院内建立专门机构
    在反动政府统治的时期，几乎遭受废弃的中医，解放之后，在中国共产党的正确政策指示下，得到复苏。并且在人民政府的大力支持下，及群众的努力下，几年来发掘了祖国医学无限的宝藏，显示出无限光芒的远景。为了实现这种远景，就必须研究祖国医学的科学性原理，以现代科学来阐明它。因此，应当在科学院另设机构，专作中医学理研究工作。其理由我分四个部分来说明：
　　一
    我国医学界存在着两种理论体系。一为经历几千年的中医，一为十八世纪初由西洋传入的西医。一个讲气化，一个讲细胞，两者理论体系不同，矛盾当然存在。我们知道，以往的西医，都是被唯心主义形而上学的思想笼罩着，以魏尔啸的细胞病理学为基础，把身体各种反应，看成是单个细胞独立反应的机械的总和，把各个局部都孤立起来。这种不正确的医学观点所导致的理论，反映到治疗方面，也便带来了不正确的治疗方法。直到巴甫洛夫学说——有机体是一个完整的统一体的学说被重视之后，使生理学放出了新异的光彩。巴甫洛夫学说传入我国，也推动了我国医学的猛进，因为他的学说是以辩证唯物主义为基础，符合于社会主义国家的人民需要，然而我们历经了几千年的祖国医学，却很早就把人体看做是一个完整统一的机体了。根据可靠的医书来看，远在公元五百多年前的春秋战国时代，就有了这种学说。但是限于古代客观条件，并没有以物理、化学、细胞等等来解释它，而是以阴阳表里、五行生克及五运六气等等的说法，来说明了有机体的统一完整性。远在几千年前就有了这种见解，实在是非常伟大的。这种整体论，一直在支持着中国医学的前进，可惜的是在历代中羼加了些道家玄理，才使近代的人认为中医不科学，是唯心论的产物，甚至于认为没有研究的价值了，加之，以往被唯心主义形而上学的思想所笼罩着的西洋医学，由于看做局部是孤立的，当然与整体的看法是格格不相容的。同时中医本身却也很少创造性，不会以现代科学解释古理。于是祖国医学的辉煌成就，不但没有推陈出新的加以发扬，反而被反动的统治者予以摧残，而日趋埋没。幸而中国共产党和英明的毛主席，提出发扬祖国医学的号召，才使祖国医学，重现光明。
    除了中医的整体论之外，如众所知，近世的巴甫洛夫学说是承认有机体的统一完整性的。然而却与中医之整体论有所不同。巴甫洛夫学说，以神经反射为主体，大脑两半球的机能主宰了一切。中医学说却不是这样，而是以五行生克、表里阴阳表示了循环关系及矛盾关系。总起来说，两者都讲整体，而说法不同。其实，整体论的学说，是全面性的，是符合辩证唯物主义法则的，所以巴甫洛夫学说与中医学说很可能融合一起，成为更完善的整体论。
　　二
    祖国医学既然有几千年的历史，又有不可磨灭的疗效事实，那么中医是不是只有经验而无理论呢？虽然我们不可否认祖国医学是几千年的经验累积，可是我们也不可忽视经验到达一定程度就要提高到理论，再由理论回到实践，循环不断，反复出新，才是进步，才有发展。假使祖国医学只有经验、没有理论的话，我想祖国医学也不会存留到今天。问题是在于中医的理论未经现代科学阐明，以致被人认为中医的理论是玄学，这种见解正是因为对祖国医学没有深入研究的结果。
    中医历代先贤，在实际的经验中找出了各脏器之间的关系，并且认识到它们之间不是各个孤立的，而是互相联系，互相制约着的，外界环境是会影响它们的。然而在古代科学未昌明的情况下，找出了以五行生克、表里阴阳来说脏器之间的关系及外界给与机体的影响，论证了机体是统一完整的。
    我们必须由历史发展来看问题，就以西洋医学来说，古代希腊也同样的曾以风、火、水、土来看人体，后来才演进到化学。假若没有经魏尔啸的细胞病理学的过程，也难由灵气病源论，一跳就跳到巴甫洛夫学说。祖国医学也同样的限于历史客观条件。中医的论法也是朴素的辩证唯物论。虽然我们知道生理不是代数，然而不能说它绝对没有道理。因此我认为祖国医学的宝藏，并不只限于宝贵的经验，而且是蕴藏着现代医学还未讲到的生理学及病理生理学的理论资料。
　　三
    由于祖国医学的珍藏，不只限于临症经验，同时在生理及病理生理学方面，蕴藏着极其丰富的材料。特别是中医在实践中所理解的脏腑之间的关系，却是现代医学还未讲过的。举例来说：中医认为肺不是孤立的生存在脏腑之间的，它同肾同脾是有着相生的关系，它同肝同心是有着相克的关系；又说肺主皮毛，肺开窍于鼻等等。一个肺同这么多的部分都有关系，在现代医学中却未见到有这种说法。但是这些关系并不是凭空乱造出来的，而是在临床上找出来的。我们在治疗上也认为肺有病，并不单纯的去治肺，而是观其生克，察其表里，全面分析，治其本原。以疗效来看，它并不是没有道理的。可是古人在实际的观察中，虽然能体会到它们之间的关系，但是限于当时的客观条件，无法按现代科学原理来释明它，也就是说有了方向而没有详细说明走那条路及如何走法。例如内经说：“肺主皮毛”，我们在临床上也确知肺与皮毛是有关系的。可是如何解释呢？古人是这样解释的：“金气坚定，皮象亦然，肺脏应金，故合皮也。”我认为这种解释并没有把其间的究竟关系解释清楚。为了阐明它们之间的关系，只有通过实验，以现代科学原理来解释它。这样就会扩大了生理学及病理生理学领域。由是，在诊断上和治疗上就有了更广泛的新途径，解决病痛就更迅捷。这种新的生理学及病理生理学，就是古今所未有的新中国独特的医学，使祖国医学在国际间占一重要地位；也就是使中西医两种不同理论统一起来，如巴甫洛夫学说一样，会影响到国际医学体系，在现代医学史上写上光辉的一页，并且完成了党交给我们的“以现代科学发扬祖国医学”的任务。
    因此，我们就不只是要研究中医方剂和治疗，而且要研究祖国医学的生理学及病理生理学。也就是说，不但要发掘它，更要发扬它。
    用现代科学研究祖国医学的生理学及病理生理学，是发扬祖国医学的途径，这应当是中国科学院的工作之一，就如同巴甫洛夫学说的研究，在苏联科学院中所占的地位一样。这是使祖国医学赶上国际水平的工作，是艰巨的而且是需要长时期的。因之必须要广集人力，尤其是要把已有现代医学基础而且对于祖国医学有了相当认识的人，集中起来，发挥集体力量进行研究。更应聘请年老中医而学有专长的人为顾问，以便使理论与实践密切联系。至于研究方法，应以实验为主，着重于活体实验，并以实际病人为对照。我们不能离开辩证唯物主义的立场、观点和方法，应当严格地坚持着从生理学出发的、并且是纯粹客观的、从外方着手的分析，然后把全部问题加以系统化。被统一的理论就可以为今后学医的规范，使中国医学不再分为中医和西医之别，填平了中西医之理论不同的鸿沟，达到了团结中西医的目的。每一个学过这种理论的，都是学贯中西的医生。这种创造性的新中国医学，是以辩证唯物主义为基础的中国独特医学。
　　四
    为了响应党中央的号召，卫生部成立了中医研究院。既然有了中医研究院，是不是没有必要在中国科学院另设中医学理研究所呢？要搞清楚这个问题，就要分清楚“社会的现实具体工作”与“自然科学的理论研究工作”。这两种工作是同样的艰巨，如果由一个机构负担下来，就有些过重。为了适应社会主义建设的速度，就应当双方并进，分工合作。中医研究院是做社会的现实具体工作，例如：历史的整理，医书验方的收集，教材的编写，治疗经验的总结及推广，疑难病症的治疗和讨论，针灸的发挥以及中药的鉴定等，但是用现代科学研究并阐明祖国医学的生理学及病理生理学，使之创造性的发扬祖国医学，达到国际水平而成为中国独特医学理论体系的工作，应当由中国科学院另设机构承担起来。这不只是中国医学内部问题，而是会影响世界医学体系的问题。这种工作也非中国科学院莫属。况且中医五行学说，现在在中医数十万人中，主张者与反对者各有半数；多年来互相驳诘，莫衷一是。中医自身先有矛盾，若不求得统一的原理，一切问题更难解决，孰是孰非，无法肯定。必须通过彻底研究，以现代科学真理确切证明，确定价值，才能求得统一，才能服人。这种工作绝对不是通过商榷、合作就可解决，也只有中国科学院才是最适当的负担起这个工作的机构。
    党号召我们向科学进军，为了超额完成十二年计划，就更有在中国科学院专设研究机构的必要。尤其是当此研究人员逐渐增多，而中医有丰富经验的前辈们却渐衰老，若待其雕零已尽，纵有此种机构亦无人足以主持。时机不可失，现在筹备，尚未过晚。苏联华格拉立克教授曾说：研究中医，要有健全的组织机构和领导机构，这句话非常正确，我完全同意这种说法，我们也应当采纳这个意见。
    众所共知，凡属科学的研究工作，皆集中于中国科学院，院内设有数十个研究所，其中不少为研究祖国遗产的，祖国医学既已公认为祖国遗产之一，却被摈诸中国科学院系统之外。既然如此，却又何必在院内设置一、二闲散学部委员？马克思列宁主义教导我们要“实事求是”。试问一、两位委员能否负此艰巨的研究工作呢？发挥集体的创作能力，才是研究科学的正当途径。我们断不能认为有了中医研究院，即可引为满足，加以推诿。因为两者研究的目的不同，已如前述。
    我们为了发扬祖国遗留下来的宝贵产物，使之在现实具体工作之外，成为中国所特有的医学理论体系，就应当在中国科学院内设立专门研究的机构——中医学理研究所。
