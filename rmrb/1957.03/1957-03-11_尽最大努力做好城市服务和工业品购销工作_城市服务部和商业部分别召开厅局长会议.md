Xinhua News Agency report: The first national meeting of department and bureau chiefs of the Urban Services Department, which concluded on the 9th, determined the basic guidelines and work tasks for urban services during the transition period.

The work of the Urban Services Department in managing and operating non-staple foods, service industries, catering, and urban housing management is related to the most vital issues of production and the daily lives of the broad masses of people and is one of the most important tasks in commercial work. The meeting determined that the basic tasks of urban services during the transition period are to vigorously promote and support the development of non-staple food production, grasp the laws of production and sales, do a good job in the procurement, sales, processing, and storage of non-staple foods, ensure the supply of planned export goods, continuously improve business management, pay attention to hygiene and quarantine and production technology; develop and improve the service and catering industries in a planned way, strengthen urban housing management; continue to complete the socialist transformation of non-staple food commerce, catering, service industries, and real estate; strengthen market management, stabilize prices; and gradually meet the growing needs of the people in urban and rural areas, and further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and national unity.

The meeting pointed out that since many non-staple foods are agricultural and livestock products or are processed from them, the growth rate of non-staple food production in a certain period of time will not be able to keep up with the growth rate of the needs of the broad masses of people, and the supply and demand of some or all non-staple foods will still be insufficient; however, as long as we work hard, the tension in the supply of certain non-staple foods can be alleviated and eased. After the meeting's arrangements, the planned targets for non-staple food procurement and sales this year increased by more than 12% compared with last year.

The meeting believed that to do a good job in the main business of operating non-staple foods, we must put promoting the development of non-staple food production in the first place. In the future, urban service departments should do a good job in non-staple food production planning under the unified leadership of party and government at all levels. The focus of non-staple food production planning is large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas, as well as key non-staple food production areas.

Because urban service work is closely related to people's lives, the meeting especially emphasized that in the future, we must closely contact the masses of the people in our work. All policies and measures for non-staple food procurement must proceed from the development of agricultural and sideline production and the increase of farmers' income to consolidate agricultural cooperation. The formulation and implementation of price policies is a very important aspect of the relationship between the state and farmers, and we must concentrate our efforts this year to effectively improve this aspect of our work. The purchase prices of non-staple foods should continue to be stabilized and reasonably adjusted, and attention should be paid to maintaining reasonable price ratios with grain and ensuring that farmers have a certain profit.

This meeting also specifically studied the issues of increasing production and practicing economy and strengthening political work, studied how to alleviate the current tension in the supply and demand of service and catering industries in emerging cities and industrial and mining areas, and proposed to quickly establish and adjust the organization of the service department system to meet the needs of business development.

Xinhua News Agency report: The Ministry of Commerce held the Seventh Commercial Department and Bureau Chiefs Meeting from February 16th to March 5th. According to the current national market situation and its development trend, it determined this year's industrial product procurement and sales policy, formulated a procurement and sales plan, and discussed the Ministry of Commerce's system of increasing production and practicing economy, the establishment of organizational structures, and the transformation of joint state-private commercial enterprises and small vendors.

The meeting clearly pointed out that the market situation this year is tense, and there are many difficulties in the work; however, after the state takes important measures such as carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy and appropriately reducing investment in basic construction, as well as the efforts of all parties, it will ensure that the growth of social purchasing power in 1957 is controlled, promote the balance between purchasing power and commodity supply, maintain market stability, and the tense market situation will gradually ease.

In order to do a good job in procurement and sales, this meeting determined that the important measures that must be taken in commercial work this year are:

Actively organize sources of goods according to market needs. Among daily-use industrial products, all those that were purchased by the Ministry of Commerce system in the past must continue to be guaranteed to be purchased. When organizing local sources of goods, on the one hand, attention should be paid to sales and prevent blind development, and on the other hand, there must be raw materials, and the state's unified distribution of raw materials should not be disrupted. The meeting believed that the more scarce the main daily-use industrial products are, the more necessary it is to strengthen the unified allocation across the country and support each other, so that limited sources of goods can play the greatest role.

This year's commodity sales policy is: in terms of people's daily-use industrial products, except for several major commodities such as cloth, coal, petroleum, paper, some medicines, and some chemical industrial products, which must be strictly controlled for sales according to the plan, other commodities should adopt a policy of actively promoting sales. As for the supply of industrial raw materials, we must take into account the needs of both industry and handicrafts, and in the first half of this year, we should support the production of daily-use industrial products as much as possible. Commercial departments will no longer supply units to which the state has already uniformly distributed raw materials.

The meeting believed that the organizational structure, leadership relationship, and various systems of the current Ministry of Commerce system have some aspects that are not suitable for the current situation and need to be reformed. However, the time is not yet ripe for a general reform, and each province will select several counties to conduct experiments in the first half of the year according to the plan adopted by the meeting.

In terms of the transformation of joint state-private commercial enterprises and small vendors, the meeting determined that the central task of joint state-private commercial enterprises that have already implemented fixed interest rates this year is to gradually establish democratic management, carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, and systematically summarize the historical experience of private commercial operation and management. The central task of the transformation of small vendors this year is to consolidate the organized cooperative shops and cooperative groups and improve the socialist consciousness of small vendors. In addition, the meeting also decided that political and ideological work must be strengthened in the commercial system and discussed ways to strengthen political and ideological work.

    尽最大努力做好城市服务和工业品购销工作
    城市服务部和商业部分别召开厅局长会议
    据新华社讯　9日结束的城市服务部第一届全国厅、局长会议，确定了城市服务工作在过渡时期的基本方针和今年的工作任务。
    城市服务部经营和管理的副食品和服务业、饮食业、城市房产管理等方面的工作，关系到生产和广大人民群众日常生活最切身的问题，是商业工作中最重要的工作之一。会议确定城市服务工作在过渡时期的基本任务是：大力促进和扶植副食品生产的发展，掌握产销规律，做好副食品的采购、销售、加工和储存工作，保证计划出口物资的供应，不断地改善经营管理，注意卫生检疫和生产技术；有计划地发展和改进服务业与饮食业，加强城市房产管理；继续完成对于副食品商业、饮食业、服务业和房产业的社会主义改造；加强市场管理，稳定物价；逐步满足城乡人民生活日益增长的需要，进一步巩固工农联盟和民族团结。
    会议指出，由于好多副食品都是农、牧业产品或者是用它加工制成的，在一定时期内，副食品生产的增长速度与广大人民需要的增长速度还会不相适应，这些或那些副食品的供求不足情况还是会存在的；但是只要我们努力做好工作，某些副食品的供应紧张程度是可以减轻和缓和的。经过会议安排，今年的副食品采购和销售计划指标比去年增加12％以上。
    会议认为，要把经营副食品这项主要业务做好，必须把促进副食品生产的发展放在首要地位。城市服务部门今后要在各级党政统一领导下，做好副食品生产规划。副食品生产规划的重点是：大中城市和工矿区以及副食品重点产区。
    因为城市服务工作同人民生活的关系十分密切，会议特别强调今后在工作中要密切联系人民群众。副食品采购工作的各项政策和措施，都必须从有利于农副业生产的发展和增加农民收入出发，以巩固农业合作化。价格政策的制定和执行，是国家同农民关系的一个很重要的方面，今年必须集中精力有效地改进这一方面的工作。副食品收购价格应该继续稳定和进行合理的调整，要注意与粮食维持合理的比价，并保证农民有一定的利润。
    这次会议还专门研究了增产节约和加强政治工作问题，研究了怎样缓和目前新兴城市和工矿区服务业、饮食业供求紧张的问题，并且提出迅速地建立和调整服务部系统的机构，以适应业务发展的需要。
    据新华社讯　商业部在2月16日到3月5日召开第七届商业厅、局长会议，根据目前全国市场情况及其发展趋势，确定了今年的工业品购销方针，制定了购销计划，对于商业部系统的增产节约、组织机构的设置以及公私合营商业和小商小贩的改造工作，也进行了讨论。
    会议明确指出，今年市场情况是紧张的，工作中的困难是很多的；但是经过国家采取开展增产节约运动、适当削减基本建设投资等重要措施以及各方面的努力，将保证1957年社会购买力有控制的增长，促使购买力和商品供应量接近平衡，保持市场的稳定，市场紧张的情况会逐步趋向缓和。
    为了做好购销工作，这次会议确定今年商业工作必须采取的重要措施是：
    根据市场需要积极组织货源。在日用工业品中，凡是过去由商业部系统收购的，必须继续保证收购。在组织地方货源时，一方面要注意到有销路，防止盲目发展，另一方面又要有原料，不要打乱国家统一分配原料的计划。会议认为主要日用工业品越是不足，就越需要加强全国的统一调度，互相支援，才能使有限的货源，发挥最大的作用。
    今年的商品销售政策是：在人民日用工业品方面，除几种主要商品如布匹、煤炭、石油、纸张、部分药品和部分化学工业产品，必须严格按计划控制销售以外，其他商品都应该采取积极推销的方针。至于工业原材料的供应，必须兼顾工业和手工业两方面的需要，今年上半年应当尽可能支持日用工业品的生产。对于国家已经统一分配原料的单位，商业部门不再供应。
    会议认为目前商业部系统的组织机构、领导关系和各种制度，都存在着某些与当前情况不相适应的地方，需要进行一些改革。但是目前普遍进行改革的时机还不成熟，由各省选择若干县根据会议通过的方案在上半年内进行试验。
    在公私合营商业和小商贩的改造方面，会议确定已经实行定息的公私合营商业今年的中心任务，是要逐步地建立民主管理，开展增产节约运动，有计划地总结私营商业经营管理的历史经验。小商小贩改造方面今年的中心任务，是巩固已经组织起来了的合作商店、合作小组和提高小商小贩的社会主义觉悟。此外，会议还决定了在商业系统中必须加强政治思想工作，并讨论了加强政治思想工作的办法。
