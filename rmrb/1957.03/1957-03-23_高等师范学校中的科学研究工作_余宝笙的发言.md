Scientific Research Work in Higher Normal Schools
Yu Baosheng's Speech

Now I would like to offer some personal opinions on several issues concerning the development of scientific research work in higher normal schools:

Should Have Its Own Scientific Research Direction

I. Regarding the question of what kind of scientific research work should be carried out in higher normal schools, there are currently two different views. Some believe that the task of higher normal schools is to train middle school teachers. Therefore, the teachers in higher normal schools should conduct research on educational science theory and practice, as well as aspects related to general education. Others believe that higher normal schools, like other universities, can conduct scientific research in various fields. I think these views are not comprehensive enough and do not fully recognize that higher normal schools are an organic part of higher education, and that higher normal schools have their specific tasks. Higher normal schools also undertake the educational and scientific research work of universities and are part of the entire cultural and scientific undertaking. Therefore, it has commonalities with general universities. However, the specific task of higher normal schools is to train middle school teachers, so it has its own particularity in higher education. Recognizing this point, one will not mechanically think that the scientific research of higher normal schools is simply to study the theory and practice of educational science, or to carry out scientific research in various fields without distinction from general universities. Regarding this issue, I believe that higher normal schools should formulate research directions based on the specific conditions of the school, the needs of teaching, and the needs of national economic development. At the same time, we should also consider the teachers' specialties and the school's equipment conditions to formulate scientific research plans. We cannot mechanically affirm that we only do certain scientific research work or not do certain scientific research work. As long as the conditions permit and there is a need, I think it is necessary to do specific scientific research, and also to do scientific research on common issues.

Four Problems That Need to Be Solved Currently

II. Regarding the key issues in carrying out scientific research work, I personally think the following points are worth noting:

1. How to give play to the potential strength of veteran teachers. Generally speaking, veteran teachers have considerable levels in teaching and scientific research, can train relatively advanced socialist construction cadres, and can engage in relatively heavy scientific research work. Since Premier Zhou's remarks on intellectuals were put forward, many veteran professors have been greatly encouraged and want to do their best to carry out scientific research work to meet the needs of the overall development of the situation and catch up with the world's advanced scientific levels within twelve years. But the problem now is that these small number of veteran professors have the ability to lead scientific research, but they mostly feel that the task is heavy. They have to teach, train young teachers, and participate in social and political activities. Some veteran professors also have to take on administrative leadership work. This makes it almost impossible to carry out scientific research work. The school authorities generally respect veteran teachers and give them administrative leadership positions, such as president, vice president, provost, department head, etc. But this increases their burden and creates a contradiction for carrying out scientific research work. How to solve this contradiction? I think that for these veteran professors who have the ability to lead scientific research, their burden should be reduced as much as possible, so that everyone feels that it is glorious to be a professor, and it is even more glorious to make achievements in teaching and scientific research. Respecting them should be respecting their achievements in their careers, and it is not necessary to give them many positions to be considered respect. Similarly, as a professor, one should also realize that it is glorious to make achievements in work, and it is not glorious to hold any position. I think that if all parties can reach a consensus, and gradually relieve them of their administrative work and reduce social activities under possible conditions, so that they have more strength and time to engage in scientific research work, it will be beneficial.

2．How to cooperate with the Academy of Sciences. At present, the Academy of Sciences is trying to win over some teachers or engineering and technical experts with higher levels who are engaged in scientific and technological work in universities or business departments. Some people think that scientific research work should be concentrated in the Academy of Sciences to have the conditions. Therefore, some veteran teachers with higher levels or scientific and technical personnel in business departments have become uneasy about their current jobs. To a certain extent, it has affected their teaching and work. Is it better to concentrate these higher-level scientists in the Academy of Sciences or to disperse them in various universities or industrial organs? This is a contradiction. It is necessary to concentrate the necessary talents in the Academy of Sciences for key research. However, various universities and industrial organs undertake the actual tasks in socialist construction, and these higher-level professors and scientific and technological experts are also indispensable. How to solve this contradiction is the issue of cooperation between the Academy of Sciences and various universities and business departments. I think that the Academy of Sciences should systematically and planfully incorporate the research projects of various universities into the research scope of the Academy of Sciences. The Academy of Sciences can select topics and entrust universities with conditions and possibilities to conduct research on this issue, without the need to concentrate all the talents in the Academy of Sciences. In this way, the scientific research work carried out by the universities is also the research work carried out by the Academy of Sciences, and the universities conduct research separately under the unified planning of the Academy of Sciences, so as to avoid blindly producing duplicate topics and reduce the waste of human and material resources. At the same time, these professors and experts can work with peace of mind and devote themselves to scientific research. If this cooperative relationship is well established, the development of scientific research work in universities will be better guaranteed.

3．Regarding the issue of professors' training and advanced studies. Some veteran teachers have relatively rich teaching experience and have a relatively solid foundation for conducting scientific research, but their common feeling is that they have no time and no conditions to carry out scientific research. These veteran professors are already too busy in their actual work, which makes them unable to carry out research despite having a foundation, and prevents them from making greater achievements. Everyone also feels that in recent years, these veteran teachers have been used more and improved less. How to enable these veteran teachers to carry out scientific research on the existing basis and give play to greater potential, I personally think that a vacation system should be established, and after a considerable period of time, they should be given a certain period of vacation to go to a more suitable environment with conditions for further study. I also suggest that the Ministry of Higher Education sign a contract with the Chinese Academy of Sciences to allow teachers in these higher education institutions to go to the Academy of Sciences for further study during their vacation. If these teachers with a foundation are given a certain period of further study, it will be of greater help to the development of scientific research.

4．Regarding the issue of young teachers carrying out scientific research. In recent years, the team of young teachers in higher normal schools is the largest, but generally speaking, the quality is not high enough. How to improve their quality and enable them to better carry out scientific research work is a pressing issue at present. I think that the main method of training and improving young teachers is to use the method of "on-the-job training," and improve their professional level through teaching and being assistants to veteran professors, and improve their scientific and technological level through scientific research and being assistants to veteran professors. Since the call to march towards science was put forward, the enthusiasm of young teachers has been extremely high. However, two kinds of ideological situations have also emerged. One is to attach importance to further study and neglect teaching work, and always hope to reach the requirements of associate doctor in a few years, resulting in an over-eager and over-high mood. The other is that they are not humble and unwilling to learn from veteran professors in their work, and only see the shortcomings of veteran teachers, but not the advantages. The existence of these ideas has affected the development of scientific research work by young teachers to a certain extent. In the relationship between young and old teachers, young teachers should respect veteran teachers and assist veteran teachers. Veteran teachers should also care for and help young teachers. We only have one common goal, which is to build socialism. Regarding the on-the-job training of young teachers, I suggest that the Ministry of Higher Education formulate a system to allow young teachers to achieve certain achievements through professional practice and scientific research during their further study. After writing papers, examinations, defenses, and other processes, and reaching a certain level, they should be given a certain degree to encourage on-the-job youth to work with peace of mind and study hard. As for the four-year postgraduate system currently implemented, only relying on teachers' personal apprenticeship method, there is no certain standard, the specifications are inconsistent, so the level reached is also inconsistent. For long-term planning, a formal graduate school system should be established to systematically allow graduate students to conduct research work to reach certain specifications in order to train a large number of high-level professional talents that meet international standards.

    高等师范学校中的科学研究工作
    余宝笙的发言
    现在我就关于高等师范学校开展科学研究工作中的几个问题，提出一些个人的意见：
    应当有自己的科学研究方向
    一、在高等师范学校应开展那些科学研究工作，在这个问题上，目前有二种不同的看法。有的认为高等师范学校的任务是培养中等学校教师。因此，高等师范学校的教师就应该进行关于教育科学理论和实践以及与普通教育有关方面的研究工作。也有的认为高等师范学校与其它高等学校一样，可以进行各方面的科学研究工作，我认为这些看法都不够全面，对高等师范学校是高等教育的有机组成部分，而高等师范学校又有其特定的任务认识不足。高等师范学校同样担负了高等学校的教育和科学研究工作，是整个文化科学事业的一部分，因此，它与一般高等学校有共同性。但高等师范学校的特定任务是培养中等学校教师，因此，它在高等教育中又有其特殊性。认识到这一点，就不会机械地认为高等师范学校的科学研究只是单纯地研究教育科学的理论和实践，或是与一般高等学校没有区分地同样开展各方面的科学研究。关于这个问题我认为高等师范学校开展科学研究工作应该是根据学校的具体情况，看教学的需要，看国民经济发展中的需要来订出研究的方向，同时还要看教师的专长，看学校的设备条件，来订出科学研究计划。不能机械地肯定只做那一部门或不做那一部门的科学研究工作，只要是条件许可，而又有需要，我认为是应该做特殊性的，也可以作共同性的问题的科学研究。
    当前需要解决的四个问题
    二、关于开展科学研究工作的关键问题在那里，我个人认为值得注意的有下面几点：
    1、如何发挥老教师的潜在力量问题。一般说老教师在教学和科学研究方面，都是有相当水平，能培养比较高级的社会主义建设干部，能从事比较繁重的科学研究工作。自从周总理关于知识分子的问题提出后，很多老教授都得到极大的鼓舞，想尽力开展科学研究工作，以适应整个形势发展的需要，在十二年内赶上世界先进科学水平。但现在的问题是这些数量不多的老教授，他们有领导做科学研究的能力，但他们大都感到任务繁重，他们既要教学，又要培养青年教师，还要参加社会上的政治活动，一部分老教授又要担任行政领导工作，这样把开展科学研究工作就搞到几乎没有时间了。学校当局对老教师一般是尊重的，给他们以行政领导地位，如院长、副院长、教务长、系主任等等。但这样给他们负担加重，对开展科学研究工作，就构成了矛盾。如何解决这个矛盾呢？我认为对这些有领导开展科学研究能力的老教授，应尽量减少他们的负担，让大家感到作为一个教授是光荣的，而在教学上、在科学研究工作上做出成绩那就更光荣，尊重他们应该是尊重他们在事业上的成就，不一定要给他们以许多的职位才算是尊重。同样作为一个教授，也应该认识到在工作中做出成绩才光荣，不一定担任到什么职位才算是光荣。我想如果各方面都能取得一致的看法，在可能条件下，逐步解除他们的行政工作，减少社会活动，使他们有更多的力量和时间来从事科学研究工作，这是有好处的。
    2．如何与科学院合作的问题。目前在高等学校或业务部门一些水平较高的，从事科学技术工作的教师或工程技术专家，科学院正在设法争取，有些人就认为从事科学研究工作应该是集中到科学院去才有条件，因而使一些水平较高的老教师或业务部门中科学技术人员对现有岗位工作就产生不安心的现象。在一定程度上影响了他们的教学和工作。究竟这些有较高水平的科学家是集中在科学院好还是分散在各个高等院校或产业机关更好呢？这是一个矛盾，集中必要的人材在科学院进行重点研究是必要的。但各个高等院校和产业机关是担负了社会主义建设中的实际任务，对这些水平较高的教授和科技专家，也是不可缺少的，如何解决这个矛盾，这就是科学院与各院校和业务部门的合作问题。我认为科学院应该有系统有计划地把各院校的研究项目纳入科学院的研究范围之内，科学院可以选定题目，委托有条件、有可能对这个问题进行研究的院校进行研究，而不必要把人材都集中到科学院来，这样做，院校进行的科学研究工作，也即是科学院进行的研究工作，而各院校又在科学院的统一规划下，分头进行研究，不致盲目地产生重复选题的现象，以减少人力物力的浪费。同时也使这些教授、专家能安心工作致力于科学研究。这个合作关系搞好了，高等学校的科学研究工作开展就有了更大的保证。
    3．关于教授的培养进修问题。一些老教师教学经验比较丰富，进行科学研究较有基础，但他们的共同感觉是，要开展科学研究，没有时间，没有条件。这些老教授，在实际工作上已是忙不过来，因而，致令他们有基础却不能开展研究，不能让他们做出更大的成绩来。大家也都感觉几年来对这些老教师还是使用多、提高少。如何使这些老教师在已有的基础上进行科学研究，发挥更大的潜力，我个人认为应该建立休假制度，到相当期间，给他一定时期的休假，让他到有条件的更适当的环境里去进修。我还建议高等教育部与中国科学院订立合约，让这些高等院校的教师在休假期间到科学院去进修，如果对这些有基础的教师给他们一定时期的进修，对开展科学研究会有更大的帮助。
    4．关于青年教师开展科学研究的问题。几年来在高等师范学校的青年教师，队伍最大，但一般说来质量还是不够高，如何提高他们的质量，让他们更好地来开展科学研究工作，这是当前一个迫切问题，我认为对青年教师的培养和提高的方法主要是用“在职进修”的办法，通过教学，做老教授的助手，来提高自己的业务水平，通过科学研究，做老教授的助手，以提高自己的科学技术水平。自从向科学进军的号召提出后，青年教师的积极性是极高的。但也产生了两种思想情况，一种是重视进修，忽视了教学工作，总希望在几年之后达到副博士的要求，产生一种过急、过高的情绪。另一种是在工作中不虚心不肯向老教授学习，只看见老教师的缺点，没有看见老教师的优点，这些思想的存在都在一定程度上影响了青年教师对科学研究工作的开展，在青老教师的关系上，青年教师应该尊重老教师，协助老教师。老教师也应该爱护、帮助青年教师。我们只有一个共同的目标，就是为了建设社会主义。关于青年教师的在职进修，我建议高教部订出制度，让青年教师在进修中通过专业实践，通过科学研究，取得一定成就，经过写论文、考试、答辩等过程，达到一定程度，应给予一定的学位，以鼓励在职青年安心工作，认真进修。至于目前所实行的四年制的研究生制度，仅依靠教师个人带徒弟的办法，没有一定的标准，规格不一致，因此所达到的水平也不一致。为了长远的计划，应该建立正规的研究院制度，有系统地让研究生进行研究工作，以达到一定的规格。以培养出大量的合乎国际水平的高级专业人材。
