For fifteen years, lying has been its lifeblood.

    On February 25th, the "Voice of America" solemnly celebrated its fifteenth anniversary. On this day, it made a special broadcast to "celebrate its birthday". This broadcast, like the other tens of thousands of broadcasts it has made over the past fifteen years, was full of lies that distorted the truth.

    When the skilled broadcaster introduced the history of the "Voice of America" to the audience, he proudly emphasized: "The Voice of America" began its first broadcast fifteen years ago like this: "This is the broadcast of the 'Voice of America,'... We want to broadcast news to you, the listeners. This news may be good or it may be bad, but we will do our best to broadcast the truth to you." Such self-boasting, not to mention what ridiculous feelings it would arouse in the minds of people in various countries, even from the evaluation of the "Voice of America" by the American bourgeois newspapers, they would think it was nonsense. An article in the "New York Times" in August of the year before last that discussed the "Voice of America" wrote: The leaders of the "Voice of America" "believe that their task is to erect a mirror in front of the government, through the government erect a mirror in front of the people of the country, and then transmit the reflection to the world." However, this mirror has become a "mirror that distorts the image," it "reduces embarrassing situations" and "exaggerates what they consider positive things." It should be pointed out that the author of this article has not said the other side of the truth, that is: "The Voice of America" is not only accustomed to "distorting the facts", but also accustomed to fabricating shameless slanders and incitements. Rather than saying that the "Voice of America" is a "funhouse mirror" that deliberately distorts the truth, it is more appropriate to say that it is a trumpet for American warmongers.

    But the broadcasters of the "Voice of America" have spent much effort for fifteen years and have not achieved any gratifying results. Last year, when the US government requested an increase in international propaganda funding, some members of the US Congress complained that the US International Information Administration—the leading agency of the "Voice of America"—wasted a lot of money, but "its work is of no value in winning friends for the United States." The failure of the "Voice of America" can never be concealed by the self-boasting of its broadcasters.

    The broadcaster reminded his audience in a particularly meaningful way: "Our address is very close to the US Capitol Building, we are on Independence Avenue..." In this way, the broadcasters of the "Voice of America" can see the Abraham Lincoln Memorial standing nearby just by opening the window. So why didn't they think of a famous saying by Lincoln? Lincoln once said: "You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time." (Rui)

    撒谎十五年
    2月25日，“美国之音”郑重其事地庆祝它成立十五周年。在这一天，它特别作了一次给自己“祝寿”的广播。这一次广播也和它十五年来其他千万次广播一样，充满着颠倒黑白的谎言。
    那位熟练的广播员在向听众介绍“美国之音”的历史的时候，自鸣得意地强调说：“美国之音”在十五年前是这样开始它的第一次广播的：“这是‘美国之音’的广播，……我们要把新闻广播给诸位听众听，这些新闻可能是好的，也可能是不好的，但是我们尽力向诸位播送真实的新闻”。这种自我吹嘘，且不说会在各国人民的心目中引起怎样可笑的感觉，就是从美国的资产阶级报刊一向对“美国之音”的评价看来，它们也会认为这是胡说八道。“纽约时报”前年8月间刊载过一篇谈论“美国之音”的文章里就曾写道：“美国之音”的领导者“认为他们的任务是在政府面前树立一面镜子，通过政府在全国人民面前树立一面镜子，然后把反映传给世界”。但是，这面镜子成了“歪曲形象的镜子”，它“把难堪的局面缩小”，“把他们所认为的正面事物夸大”。应该指出，这篇文章的作者还没有说出真相的另外一面，那就是：“美国之音”不仅惯于“歪曲事实”，而且还惯于凭空捏造地进行无耻的诽谤和煽动。如其说“美国之音”是个故意歪曲真象的“哈哈镜”，倒不如说它是美国战争贩子的喇叭更恰当些。
    但是“美国之音”的广播员们十五年来费尽了许多唇舌，并没有得到什么值得自慰的成就。去年美国政府要求增拨国际宣传经费的时候，美国国会中就有议员埋怨美国的国际宣传署——“美国之音”的领导机关浪费了不少金钱，但是“它的工作对于为美国争取朋友毫无价值。”“美国之音”的失败绝不是它的广播员的自我吹嘘所能掩饰的。
    这位广播员特别意味深长地提醒他的听众：“我们的地址距离美国国会大楼很近，我们就在独立街，……”这样说，“美国之音”的广播员们只要打开窗户就可以望见矗立在附近的亚伯拉罕·林肯纪念碑了。那么他们为什么没有想到林肯的一句名言呢？林肯曾经说过：“不妨在某些时候欺骗某些人，也不妨在某些时候欺骗一切的人，可是你决不能在一切的时候欺骗一切的人。”（瑞）
