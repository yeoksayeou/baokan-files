Xinhua News Agency, 28th. The Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace and the Chinese Asian Solidarity Committee today sent telegrams to the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, supporting their struggle against British atomic and hydrogen weapon tests.

The telegram from the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace stated: "Your Council is launching a 'Stop the Tests Decade' to oppose British atomic and hydrogen weapon tests. We extend our highest respect to the Japanese people for their unremitting struggle against nuclear weapons and the establishment of atomic bases in Japan.

The Chinese people deeply sympathize with the suffering of the Japanese people due to the atomic bombs dropped by the United States on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the hydrogen bomb test on Bikini Atoll. We firmly support the Japanese people's various efforts to ban nuclear weapons. The Chinese people have consistently advocated the prohibition of nuclear weapons and opposed the testing of such weapons, demanding that atomic energy be used for peaceful purposes. The Chinese people warmly welcome and support the Soviet government's repeated proposals to reach an international agreement on the prohibition of the production, use, and stockpiling of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and, above all, the prohibition of testing, and are indignant that these proposals have been unreasonably rejected by the United States and other Western countries. We are willing to work with the Japanese people and the people of the world to jointly strive for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons and for the defense of peace in Asia and the world."

The telegram from the Chinese Asian Solidarity Committee stated: "The prohibition of the use and testing of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and all other weapons of mass destruction is the consistent proposition of the Chinese people. In the cause of realizing this proposition and defending peace in Asia and the world, we are willing to unite with the Japanese people and all peace-loving people in Asia and the world to fight together."

    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的电文说：“贵会为反对英国进行原子武器、氢武器试验开展‘制止试验旬’，谨向为反对核子武器、反对在日本设立原子基地而作不懈斗争的日本人民致以崇高的敬意。
    中国人民深切同情日本人民由于美国在广岛、长崎投掷原子弹和在比基尼岛试验氢弹所遭受的痛苦，坚决支持日本人民为禁止核子武器而进行的各种努力，中国人民一贯主张禁止核子武器，并反对试验这种武器，要求把原子能用于和平目的。中国人民热烈欢迎并支持苏联政府一再提出的就禁止原子武器、氢武器的生产、使用、储存及首先禁止试验达成国际协议的建议，并因这些建议竟遭到美国和其他西方国家的无理拒绝而感到愤慨。我们愿与日本人民和全世界人民一道，为禁止原子武器和氢武器，为保卫亚洲与世界和平而共同奋斗。”
