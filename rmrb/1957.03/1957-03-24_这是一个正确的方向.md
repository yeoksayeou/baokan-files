　　The Nanyang County Food Company's assistance to farmers in developing hog production through the purchase of live pigs is a very good experience. They regard caring about hog production and promoting hog production as an important task in their work. Therefore, hog production in Nanyang County has developed, the purchase task has been overfulfilled, and the relationship between the food company and the masses has also improved. This experience is worthy of attention from all regions.
　　The fundamental purpose of our socialist construction is to meet the needs of the people; and the premise of meeting the needs of the people is to develop production. This is a common truth that everyone knows. The Nanyang County Food Company put this common truth into practice and achieved work results. However, there are still many grassroots commercial units and procurement personnel who do not do this today. In their daily work, they often only focus on completing the purchase tasks, and do not ask about the production situation.
　　Some grassroots commercial units or procurement personnel even believe that commercial staff caring about production is "not doing their job properly." This view is wrong. When we say that commercial staff should care about production, we are by no means asking commercial personnel to abandon their own business and directly lead production, but to do their own business well while vigorously supporting production. The Nanyang County Food Company has already set an example in this regard: they found fine breed piglets in the purchase work, ordered them and then sold them to agricultural cooperatives in need; they raised excellent boars and provided free breeding services for the sows of the masses; in addition to completing the prescribed tasks, the company's veterinarians also actively provided disease prevention and treatment for the pigs of the masses... These are things that can be done using the convenience of work, which will not only not affect their own business, but also allow the purchase task to be completed better due to the promotion of production.
　　Caring about production also means caring about the masses engaged in production. The reason why the Nanyang County Food Company was able to discover the problems and difficulties existing in the masses' pig raising and try to help solve them also shows that they have a strong mass perspective. In order to do a good job in commercial work, we must strengthen the production perspective and the mass perspective, and learn from the work style of the Nanyang County Food Company.

　　这是一个正确的方向

    南阳县食品公司通过生猪收购工作扶助农民发展生猪生产，是一个很好的经验。他们把关心生猪生产和促进生猪生产作为自己工作中一项重要任务。因此，南阳县的生猪生产发展了，收购任务超额完成了，食品公司和群众的关系也搞好了。这个经验值得各地重视。
    我们建设社会主义的根本目的，是为了满足人民的需要；而满足人民需要的前提，就是发展生产。这是大家都知道的一个普通道理。南阳县食品公司就是把这个普通道理贯彻到实践中去，而取得了工作成绩。但是，在今天还有许多基层商业单位和采购人员不是这样作的，他们在日常工作中，常常只顾完成收购任务，至于生产情况如何则不加过问。
    也有些基层商业单位或采购人员，甚至认为商业工作人员过问生产是“不务正业”。这种看法是错误的。我们说商业工作人员应当关心生产，决不是要求商业人员丢开自己的业务，去直接领导生产，而是要求他们做好自己的业务，同时大力扶助生产。南阳县食品公司在这方面已经做出了样子：他们在收购工作中发现了良种仔猪，就订购下来再卖给需要的农业社；他们养着优良种猪免费给群众的母猪配种；公司的兽医除了完成规定任务，还积极给群众防治猪病……。这些都是利用工作之便可以做到的事，不但不会影响本身业务，而且由于促进了生产，收购任务可以完成的更好。
    关心生产，也就会关心从事生产的群众。南阳县食品公司所以能发现群众养猪中存在的那些问题和困难，并且设法帮助解决，这也就说明了他们有较强的群众观点。为了做好商业工作，我们必须加强生产观点和群众观点，学习南阳县食品公司的工作作风。
