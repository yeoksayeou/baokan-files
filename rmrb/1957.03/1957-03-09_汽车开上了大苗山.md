    Cars Reach the Greater Miao Mountains
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the first highway in the Greater Miao Mountains built by farmers of the Miao Autonomous County of Greater Miao Mountains in Guangxi Province during their agricultural slack season—the Fu-San Highway (from Fushi on the Liu (zhou) Chang (an) Road to Sanfang in the western part of the Greater Miao Mountains)—has been opened to traffic up to Rongshui Town, the capital of the Autonomous County.
    When the colorfully decorated cars crossed the Rongjiang River on the afternoon of the 5th and entered the Greater Miao Mountain area, thousands of people from all ethnic groups in the Autonomous County held a grand opening ceremony in the northern part of Rongshui Town. After the opening ceremony, a Lusheng team composed of Miao youths and a waist drum team of Han girls led the cars into Rongshui Street.
    The Greater Miao Mountain area, which stretches three to four hundred *li* in all directions, is rich in timber, bamboo, mushrooms, medicinal materials, etc. In the past, due to inconvenient transportation, many local products could not be transported out; and the grain, cloth, salt and other daily necessities needed by more than 100,000 Miao, Yao, Dong, Zhuang and other ethnic groups in the northwestern mountain areas often could not be fully supplied due to untimely transportation. After the opening of the Fu-San Highway, these problems will be gradually solved.

    汽车开上了大苗山
    据新华社讯　广西省大苗山苗族自治县的农民，利用农闲时间修筑的大苗山上的第一条公路——浮三公路（从柳（州）长（安）路上的浮石到大苗山西部的三防）已经通车到自治县的首府融水镇。
    当装扮得五彩缤纷的汽车在5日下午渡过融江，开进了大苗山区时，自治县各族各界数千人在融水镇北部举行了隆重的通车典礼。通车典礼结束后，由苗族青年组成的籚笙队和汉族姑娘的腰鼓队引导汽车进入融水街上。
    横直三四百里的大苗山区盛产木材、竹子、香菇、药材等，过去因交通不便，很多土产不能外运；而西北部山区中十多万苗、瑶、侗、僮等族人民所需的粮食、布匹、食盐及其他日用品，也常常因运输不及时，不能充分供应。浮三公路通车后，这些问题将可逐步解决。
