    Voting in a Festive Atmosphere
    Li Ke, Dai Feng
    Early in the morning of March 3rd, as the Spassky Tower clock in the Kremlin had just struck six, Radio Moscow broadcast the first strains of the Soviet national anthem, and the hundreds of polling stations in Moscow opened their doors. The solemn local Soviet elections began. Like people all over the Soviet Union, millions of Muscovites happily headed to the polls, enjoying the rights granted by the world's most democratic social system: to elect the most beloved people who faithfully serve the people into the local Soviets.
    At 5:15 AM, before it was light, we drove along the city's main streets. The entrance of every polling station was brightly lit. Soviet flags fluttered in the wind on every street and building. The city streets were jubilant, and the people were immersed in a festive and joyful election fervor.
    The first polling station in Moscow's Frunze district was located in a brightly lit club. In the center of the polling station hall hung a huge portrait of Lenin and two Soviet flags, in front of which were two ballot boxes, each more than half a person's height. Beautiful flowers were all around. To the left was a long row of tables for receiving ballots. To the right were three secret ballot booths made of blue velvet cloth.
    Late at night, the first voter arrived here – the white-haired, pension-receiving Yeksterava. By 5:45 AM, many people were already standing by the door of the voting hall. At exactly six o'clock, the chairman of the polling station election committee, Babayenko, congratulated the voters and announced the start of voting. Voters received their ballots according to the alphabetical order of their surnames. The first person to cast a ballot was the sixty-three-year-old Yeksterava. She happily told reporters, "Since I first obtained the right to vote, I have always been the first to cast my ballot here." Today, 2,052 workers, engineers, housewives, writers, scientists, etc. will cast their votes here. They are voting to elect the Moscow City Soviet representative, the famous architect, and the chief person responsible for the construction of the Lenin Central Stadium, which will be the venue for the Sixth World Youth Festival this year, Gradov. Seventy-eight-year-old Nigolayeva and Babaylavna happily told us after voting: "We and the people of the entire constituency are electing our most respected people into the local Soviets, so that they will work better for us."
    Batches of voters continuously arrived at the No. 73 polling station in the Dzerzhinsky constituency. This polling station was located in the No. 259 Middle School. Within forty-five minutes, 102 people had already voted. The chairman of the polling station election committee, Falivachi, led us on a tour of the ongoing election. We saw that the election was conducted directly according to the principles of freedom and equality in a secret manner. The people of this constituency nominated Barochikova, an advanced producer from the Moscow Socks Factory, as a representative to the Moscow City Soviet, because she had excellently completed her tasks in the frontline army during the Patriotic War, and during the restoration of production and construction, she was one of the initiators of the all-Soviet socialist competition for saving raw materials. At the same time, three district Soviet representatives were nominated: Roganova, the principal of the No. 259 Middle School, Kililiko, a female experimenter from the aluminum factory, and Vibanlichaev, a welder from the aluminum factory. Baklasov came with great interest; he is a car driver at the aluminum factory. He told us: "Kililiko and Vibanlichaev are both very good workers in our factory. Today I voted for them." Matovika is a student at the Moscow Railway Institute. Today is her eighteenth birthday, and it is also the first time she has participated in voting. This polling station also has three cars specially to pick up elderly people who cannot move to participate in the election, or directly send small ballot boxes to sick people to let them vote.
    In the Sverdlovsk constituency, a polling station was located in the lounge of the Moscow Grand Hotel. This allowed many travelers from all over the Soviet Union to exercise their right to vote here.
    We visited many polling stations. Today, Moscow voters will elect their beloved city and district Soviet representatives from 853 city Soviet candidates and about 6,000 district Soviet candidates. In the election festival filled with joy and trust, we once again saw the spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people. (Moscow Dispatch, March 3rd)

    在节日气氛中投票
    李克  戴枫
    3月3日清晨，当克里姆林宫的斯巴斯基塔的大钟刚刚敲了六响，莫斯科广播电台播送第一声苏联国歌的时候，莫斯科的上百个选举站打开了大门。隆重的地方苏维埃选举开始了。像全苏各地人民一样，莫斯科的千百万人民愉快地走向选举站，享受着世界上最民主的社会制度所给予的权利：把忠心为人民服务的、自己最爱戴的人选入地方苏维埃中去。
    五点一刻，天还没有亮，我们驱车沿着市内大街行走着。每一个选举站的入口大门都被强烈的灯光照射得通亮。每一条街，每一幢大厦上苏联国旗迎风飘扬。城市街道上欢腾起来了，人民沉浸在节日愉快的选举热潮中。
    莫斯科伏龙芝区的第一选举投票站设在一座灯光辉煌的俱乐部里。这个选举站大厅正中悬挂着巨幅的列宁像和两面苏联国旗，在它们的前面摆着半人多高的投票箱两个。四周是美丽的鲜花。靠左是一长列领取选票的桌子。靠右是三个用蓝色丝绒布做成的秘密写票室。
    深夜，这里就来到了第一个投票者——白发苍苍的、领养老金的叶克斯特拉娃。五点三刻，投票大厅的大门边已站立着很多人了。正六点，选举站选举委员会主席巴巴英科向选民们道贺。并宣布开始投票。选民们分别按不同姓名字母领取选票。第一个将选票投入箱内的是六十三岁的叶克斯特拉娃。她高兴地告诉记者说：“从我第一次获得了选举权以来，在这里投下第一票的一直都是我。”今天，将有二千零五十二个工人、工程师、家庭主妇、作家、科学家等在这里投下自己的一票。他们投票选举莫斯科市苏维埃代表、著名建筑师、列宁中央体育场、即今年第六届世界青年联欢节大会会场建筑工程总负责人格拉道夫。七十八岁的尼果拉爱娃和巴拜拉甫娜投票后高兴地对我们说：“我们和全选区人民一道把我们最敬爱的人选入地方苏维埃，为的是他们将为我们更好地工作。”
    一批一批的选民不断地来到捷尔任斯基选区的七十三号选举站。这个选举站设在第二百五十九中学里。四十五分钟内已有一百零二个人投了票。选举站选举委员会主席伐立瓦契领着我们参观了正在进行选举的情形。我们见到选举是根据自由、平等的原则以秘密方式直接进行的。这选举区的人民把莫斯科袜子制造厂的先进生产者巴罗契科娃推为莫斯科市苏维埃的代表，因为她曾在卫国战争时期在前线军队中出色地完成过任务，在恢复生产建设时，她又是全苏节约原料社会主义竞赛的首倡者之一。同时推选了三个区苏维埃代表：第二百五十九中学校长罗加诺娃、制铝工厂的女实验员基利立科、制铝工厂的焊工维班利柴夫。巴克拉索夫兴致勃勃地来了，他是制铝工厂的汽车司机。他对我们说：“基利立科和维班利柴夫都是我们工厂很好的工作者。今天我投了他们的票。”玛脱维卡是莫斯科铁道学院学生，今天是她刚满十八周岁的生日，也是第一次参加投票。这个选举站还设有三个小汽车，专门接送那些年老的不能走动的人来参加选举，或者直接把小选举箱送到生病者那里让他们投票。
    斯维尔德洛夫斯克选区有一个投票站设在莫斯科大饭厅的休息室里。这允许许多来自全苏各地的旅客在这里履行选举权利。
    我们参观了很多选举站。今天，莫斯科选民将从八百五十三名市苏维埃候选人和约六千名区苏维埃候选人中选出自己的心爱的市、区苏维埃代表。在充满着欢乐和信任的选举节日中，我们又一次的见到了苏联人民精神上和政治上的团结一致。 （3月3日莫斯科电）
