The State-owned Shandong Paper Mill has produced 210 tons of paper specifically for Tibetan printing of sutras, which will soon be transported to Tibet.

In addition to requiring a uniform surface and no pulp spots, the most important quality of the printing paper for sutras is that the color must be pure apricot yellow; too dark or too light is unacceptable. The paper produced by the Shandong Paper Mill this time is clean, spotless, and the color tone is appropriate, with all quality standards met.

    为藏族生产印刷经卷用的纸张
    国营山东造纸总厂生产的二百一十吨专门供给藏族印刷经卷用的纸张，即将运往西藏。
    印经纸的质量除了要求纸面均匀、无浆斑以外，最重要的是颜色必须达到纯杏黄，过深过淡都不行。山东造纸总厂这次生产的纸洁净无斑，色调适宜，质量全部合格。
