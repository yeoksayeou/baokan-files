I wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao's speech and Premier Zhou's report, and I agree with the special reports of the leaders.

At the beginning of the founding of our country, we established four major principles: serving workers, peasants, and soldiers; prioritizing prevention; uniting Chinese and Western medicine; and combining health work with mass movements. Over the past seven years since the founding of the country, the development of people's health has achieved great successes, which is certain. However, based on my observations in Beijing, Zhejiang, Hebei, and Shanxi over the past two years, as well as information I have learned from other sources, I believe that the policy of "prioritizing prevention" has not been fully and deeply implemented. This is manifested in three aspects: first, medical institutions only focus on the treatment of patients and have not made clear arrangements for disease prevention work; second, hygiene and epidemic prevention institutions have not developed proportionally within the overall health organization structure, and the quality of work is low; third, in addition to the health departments, other economic and cultural departments often fail to consider creating suitable living and production environments for workers, peasants, students, and nearby laborers in basic construction, and they often fail to take possible and relatively thorough measures to improve the poor living and production environments left over from the past.

The proposal of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China on the Second Five-Year Plan of National Economic Development has emphasized the task of further improving the living and production conditions of the working people, reducing and eliminating several relatively serious occupational diseases, and strengthening disease prevention. Therefore, the implementation of the "prevention first" policy is very important and requires the efforts of the health department and the joint attention of other relevant departments.

Now I would like to talk about a few specific ways to implement this policy:

    Medical institutions should implement a system that combines medical treatment with prevention

First of all, in order to overcome the situation where medical institutions only provide treatment and lack prevention work, these institutions should implement a working system that combines medical treatment with prevention; this is an advanced Soviet system that can only be realized in socialist countries. We know that people first seek medical treatment when they get sick, and a doctor who is fully responsible for the health of the people should not only completely cure the patient, but also prevent the spread of the disease around the patient (if it is an infectious disease). Therefore, in terms of infectious diseases, the first requirement is that medical doctors and medical institutions should do a good job of reporting infectious diseases in accordance with the provisions of the "Infectious Disease Management Measures" (which is not being implemented well at present, especially in large hospitals); secondly, several prevalent and serious infectious diseases can be identified based on local conditions, and medical institutions can conduct temporary disinfection and necessary preventive measures for surrounding residents after receiving patients; thirdly, each medical institution should complete a certain number of planned vaccinations each year. In terms of chronic diseases (such as various types of tuberculosis, severe rheumatism, and cardiovascular diseases, etc.), patients can often only be treated in medical institutions for a period of time and then return home to recuperate. At this time, doctors or nurses should conduct regular visits for long-term medical observation and necessary medical assistance. In terms of occupational diseases in factories and mines, medical institutions should cooperate with health and epidemic prevention stations to focus on conducting research on comprehensive prevention and control methods; workers engaged in special labor should undergo medical examinations for employment and regular health check-ups. Finally, medical institutions should participate in health promotion and environmental hygiene improvement work in their respective areas. If we can do at least these few things, we will achieve greater results in reducing morbidity and eliminating serious diseases.

The above tasks should be considered by the health department to be included in the business of medical institutions; however, there should be different requirements and regulations for urban and rural hospitals, clinics, joint clinics, and private practitioners. Appropriate regulations should also be made in various places regarding the remuneration for joint clinics and private practitioners participating in prevention and health work. Public health nurses who existed in the past can be considered for re-training, and a system should be established for community visiting work.

The best way for medical institutions to carry out preventive work is to implement the Soviet system of community medical services. However, our country does not yet have sufficient conditions to implement it. At present, graded and specialized medical services and zoned medical services are being promoted in large and medium-sized cities, and some achievements have been made, which have created certain conditions for the implementation of the above-mentioned prevention work. Therefore, as long as we actively do it, the above points can be achieved. In the future, we can further implement the community medical service system step by step, and medical institutions can do more preventive work. In fact, maternal and child health care institutions in our country have long been promoting the method of contracting new midwifery services by zone, which has achieved certain results. The prevention and control method of "measles does not leave the house, doctors come to the door" tried out in Beijing in recent years has also greatly reduced pneumonia complicated infections in patients, thereby reducing the mortality rate of children with measles. Recently, Beijing has also decided to add one pediatrician to each of the several clinics in the urban area to promote children's health care in residential areas. These experiences should be summarized, made more complete, and promoted.

I would like to add that the promotion of new parenting methods, health guidance for childcare institutions, and the school doctor system in primary schools can be said to be a few weak links at present. These are all worth solving practically by the health department.

In order to overcome the difficulties in cadres and funds needed to increase prevention work in medical institutions, in terms of cadres, some female students who have graduated from junior high school and high school but cannot go to higher education can be recruited and given segmented training methods, learning while doing, and given certain qualifications after graduation as a lifelong career, so that they can take on the responsibility of assisting in promoting prevention work in medical institutions; in terms of funding, part of it can be found by the health department rectifying the public funding method and the labor insurance medical system to save some funds, shrinking the empty beds in sanatoriums, and increasing the utilization rate of hospital beds.

    The work of hygiene and epidemic prevention stations must be strengthened

Secondly, the work of hygiene and epidemic prevention stations must be strengthened. At present, more than 1,000 hygiene and epidemic prevention stations have been established across the country, but except for a very small number of stations that have a relatively good foundation, the vast majority lack senior professional health cadres (health and related cadres) and equipment, which cannot be compared with medical institutions. This makes it impossible for hygiene and epidemic prevention stations to earnestly carry out routine health supervision in labor hygiene, environmental hygiene, nutritional hygiene, and school hygiene, and they can generally only participate in organizing patriotic health movements, and they cannot even maintain it regularly. Hygiene and epidemic prevention stations have not widely implemented preventive health supervision, so that when building new cities and expanding old cities, they have failed to avoid creating difficult-to-change poor health conditions in advance, such as building residential areas downwind of industrial areas, causing residents to be harmed by factory smoke and dust, and failing to plan the sewage drainage system in advance. Furthermore, due to the lack of preventive work in the above-mentioned medical institutions, hygiene and epidemic prevention stations still cannot well implement Article 17 of the Provisional Measures for Hygiene and Epidemic Prevention Stations, which states: "Hygiene and epidemic prevention stations shall supervise and guide the hygiene and epidemic prevention work of medical and health institutions, and use all medical and health institutions (hospitals, clinics, health stations, joint clinics, etc.) to carry out hygiene and epidemic prevention work."

So how to strengthen hygiene and epidemic prevention stations? I think that according to the current possibilities, we should give priority to running the hygiene and epidemic prevention stations in large and medium-sized cities, industrial and mining areas, and provinces (autonomous regions), concentrate and distribute physicians who have graduated from the hygiene departments of medical colleges to them, equip them with other relevant senior professional cadres (laboratory technicians, chemical technicians, etc.), and enrich their equipment. This can enable the hygiene and epidemic prevention station in cities and industrial mining areas to systematically implement routine health supervision and preventive health supervision, systematically study and solve the prevention and control problems of important epidemics and occupational diseases; and enable the provincial (autonomous region) hygiene and epidemic prevention station to lead the business of small and medium-sized cities and county hygiene and epidemic prevention institutions, improve the environmental hygiene of small and medium-sized cities and rural areas, and systematically investigate and study the prevalent serious diseases and occupational diseases in the district; Moreover, the business leadership of small and medium-sized cities and county hygiene and epidemic prevention stations does not necessarily have to be carried out by the provincial (autonomous region) hygiene and epidemic prevention stations alone. It can also be carried out in a way of "large leading small" by the municipal hygiene and epidemic prevention stations and special disease prevention and treatment institutes and research institutes (such as schistosomiasis, malaria, parasitic diseases, etc.) with better conditions.

    All economic and cultural departments should take the initiative to care about the health of the working people

Finally, in addition to the health department, all economic and cultural departments should take the initiative to consider protecting the health of the working people in basic construction and daily activities, which is of fundamental significance for the implementation of the "prevention first" policy. For example, in the design of various construction projects, the ventilation, lighting, heating, heat dissipation, and dust removal devices of each building (especially factories) should meet health requirements. The design of water supply and drainage systems in urban and industrial and mining areas, especially the treatment methods of factory wastewater, should also meet health requirements. When repairing dikes and sorting out irrigation ditches, we can consider eliminating snails to prevent schistosomiasis. When building railways and highways, pay attention not to create stagnant ditches and ponds beside the road, so as to breed mosquitoes and artificially create the prevalence of diseases (such as malaria). Our country's farmland water conservancy is being vigorously developed. According to Vice Premier Deng Zihui's remarks at the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference, in 1956, a total of more than 27,000 small reservoirs were built across the country, and more than 3.8 million channels and ponds were built; according to the information exhibited at the National Agricultural Exhibition, the irrigated area of farmland across the country has increased to 500 million mu in 1956; This shows that the area of permanent and temporary water accumulation has been widely expanded, creating conditions for the breeding of mosquitoes. Therefore, we cannot but consider the possible expansion of mosquito-borne diseases (malaria, filariasis, etc.), and corresponding preventive measures should be carried out in advance in conjunction with the health department. Human feces and organic waste, which must be used in agriculture, are the main sources of intestinal infectious diseases and parasitic diseases. The agricultural department and the health department should jointly study and promote methods such as composting, storing manure, and manufacturing granular fertilizers, so as to eliminate sources of infection while still maintaining their fertilizer value. In addition, on some large construction sites, due to the concentration of workers, general living facilities are relatively simple, and the health of workers should be carefully considered in advance; for reclamation areas, an investigation should be carried out on epidemics among wild animals in nature and insects that transmit diseases, and preventive measures should be formulated to prevent reclamation personnel from suffering from diseases. In addition, carrying out mass sports activities has a positive significance for improving people's physical fitness, and requires the active support and guidance of all relevant parties. The policy of birth control is of utmost importance to the country's economic construction and the physical fitness of the next generation. This matter cannot be done well all at once and needs to be widely publicized and implemented by all relevant agencies and organizations.

There is a saying in the ancient Chinese medical classic "Huangdi Neijing Suwen": "Therefore, the sage does not treat the disease that has already occurred, but treats the disease that has not yet occurred." Ancient Chinese physicians have also long believed that the most effective way to protect people's health is to prevent diseases before they occur. This is completely correct. Now, a perfect health care network serving the health of all the people has leaped forward in the superior socialist system. In order to further improve the work efficiency of health care organizations, I have put forward some immature opinions on the implementation of the "prevention first" policy. Many CPPCC members have jointly submitted a proposal on the implementation of the "prevention first" policy. I personally plan to appeal once again here: I suggest that the Ministry of Health and relevant departments hold a national study campaign on the implementation of the "prevention first" policy, and formulate corresponding measures to implement it, so that the health care of our people can have a more comprehensive progress, so as to ensure the rapid completion of economic and cultural construction.

### 卫生工作应以预防为主  金宝善就贯彻这一方针提出三点具体建议

专栏：

    卫生工作应以预防为主
    金宝善就贯彻这一方针提出三点具体建议
    我热烈拥护毛主席的讲话和周总理的报告并同意各位首长的专题报告。
    我国在建国之初，即确定了面向工农兵、预防为主、团结中西医和卫生工作与群众运动相结合的四大原则。在建国七年多来，人民保健事业的发展已经获得了巨大的成就，这是肯定的。不过，据我两年来在北京、浙江、河北、山西视察所见和其他方面所了解的一些资料，认为“预防为主”的方针还贯彻得不全面、不深入。这表现在三方面：其一，医疗机构只局限于病人的治疗，对预防疾病的工作没有作出明确的安排；其二，卫生防疫机构在整个卫生组织机构的发展中，没有得到有比例的发展，工作质量低；其三，除卫生部门外，其他经济和文化部门在基本建设中，每每未事先考虑为工人、农民、学生和居住在附近的劳动人民创造适合于健康的生活、生产环境条件，对过去遗留下来的不良生活、生产环境条件，每每未能采取可能的较为彻底的改善措施。
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议中，已着重指出关于进一步提高劳动人民生活条件和生产条件，减少和消除几种比较严重的职业病及加强预防疾病的任务。因此“预防为主”方针的贯彻非常重要，急待卫生部门的努力和其他有关部门的共同注意。
    现在我来谈谈贯彻这个方针的几个具体办法：
    医疗机构应执行医疗与预防相结合的制度
    首先为了克服医疗机构只做治疗而缺少预防工作的情况，这些机构应当执行医疗与预防相结合的工作制度；这是苏联的先进制度，只有在社会主义性质的国家才能实现。我们知道，人民生了病首先是找医生治病，一个对人民健康全面负责的医生应当不仅要彻底治好病人，还要不使疾病在患者的周围蔓延（如果是传染病的话）。因此在传染病方面，第一个要求是医疗医生和医疗机构应根据“传染病管理办法”中的规定做好传染病报告（目前还执行得不好，尤其是大医院）；其次可根据各地情况定出几种流行严重的传染病，由医疗机构在接诊病人后，到病家去进行临时性消毒和对周围居民的必要的预防措施；再次，每个医疗机构每年要按计划完成一定的预防注射任务。在慢性病（如各种结核病、严重的风湿病和血管心脏病等）方面，病人往往只能在医疗机构治疗一个段落，然后回家休养，这时应由医生或护士定期访视，作长期的医学观察和必要的医学帮助。在工矿职业病方面，医疗机构应配合卫生防疫站重点地进行综合性防治方法的研究；对从事特别劳动的工人进行就业医学检查和定期健康检查。最后，医疗机构应当参加本地区内的卫生宣传和环境卫生改善工作。要能做到这起码的几点，在减低发病率和消灭严重疾病的效果方面就将会有更大的成绩出现。
    以上几项工作，应当由卫生部门考虑规定在医疗机构的业务之内；但对于城市和农村的医院、门诊部、联合诊所和私人开业医生，都应有不同的要求和规定。对于联合诊所和私人开业医生参加预防和卫生工作时的报酬，各地也要作出适当的规定。过去曾经有过的公共卫生护士可考虑恢复培养，并为地段访视工作建立一定制度。
    医疗机构开展预防工作的最好方法是实行苏联的地段医疗服务制。但现在我国还没有足够的条件来实行。目前在大中城市里正在推行分级分工医疗服务和划区医疗服务，并已取得了一些成绩，已为实行以上几点预防工作创造出一定条件。因此只要积极去做，以上几点是可以做到的。今后还可以进一步有步骤地实行地段医疗服务制，则医疗机构的预防工作还可以做得更多些。事实上我国妇幼保健机构早就推行着新法接生的划片包干办法，已经取得了一定成绩。北京市几年来试行“麻疹不出门，医生上门看”的防治方法，也大大地减少了患者合并感染肺炎，因而减低了麻疹病儿的病死率。近来北京市还决定要在城区的几个门诊部各增加儿科医师一人，以推行居民地段的儿童保健工作。这些经验，都应当总结起来，使其更为完备，并加以推广。
    拟补充提一下，在妇幼保健工作中，对新育儿法的推行、对托儿机构的健康指导以及小学的校医制度，目前可以说是几个薄弱的环节。这都值得卫生部门来实际解决。
    为了克服医疗机构中增加预防工作所需要的干部和经费的困难，在干部方面，可招收初中、高中毕业而不能升学的一部分女同学，给予分段训练办法，边学边做，学成后给予一定资格，作为终身职业，使她们在医疗机构担负起辅助推行预防工作的责任；在经费方面，其一部分可由卫生部门整顿公费办法和劳保医疗制度以节省一些经费，紧缩疗养院的空床，和提高医院病床的使用率等，找出它的来源。
    卫生防疫站的工作必须加强
    其次，卫生防疫站的工作必须加强。目前全国已建立的卫生防疫站已上一千个，但是除了极少数的站比较有基础外，绝大多数缺乏高级专业卫生干部（卫生和有关干部）和仪器设备，与医疗机构无法相比。这就使得卫生防疫站不能在劳动卫生、环境卫生、营养卫生和学校卫生等方面认真地执行经常性卫生监督，而一般只能参加组织爱国卫生运动，并且还不能使其保持经常。卫生防疫站还没有广泛执行预防性卫生监督，以致在建设新城市和扩建旧城市的时候，未能事先避免造成难以改变的不良卫生情况，例如将居住区建在工业区的下风向而使居民遭受工厂烟尘的侵害，没有事先筹划污水的排泄系统等。再者由于上述医疗机构缺少做预防工作，卫生防疫站至今还不能很好地执行卫生防疫站暂行办法第十七条的规定，即：“卫生防疫站对医疗卫生机构之有关卫生防疫工作进行监督与指导，并利用所有医疗卫生机构（医院、门诊部、保健站、联合诊所等）开展卫生防疫工作。”
    那么怎样来加强卫生防疫站呢？我认为应根据目前的可能，尽先重点地办好大中城市和工矿区及省（自治区）卫生防疫站，把医学院卫生系毕业的医师集中分配给它们，配备其他有关高级专业干部（化验技师、化学技师等），并充实它们的仪器设备。这样可以使城市和工矿区的卫生防疫站系统地把经常性卫生监督和预防性卫生监督执行起来，系统地研究解决重要流行病和职业病的防治问题；并可以使省（自治区）卫生防疫站能够领导起中小城市和县卫生防疫机构的业务，改善中小城市和农村的环境卫生，系统地调查研究管区内流行严重的疾病和职业病；而且对于中小城市和县卫生防疫站的业务领导，不一定由省（自治区）卫生防疫站单独来执行，还可以本着以大带小的方式由条件较好的省辖市卫生防疫站和特种疾病防治所和研究所（如血吸虫病、疟疾、寄生虫病等）划片分工执行。
    各经济文化部门应主动关心劳动人民的健康
    最后，除卫生部门外，各经济和文化部门在基本建设和日常活动中，应主动考虑到保护劳动人民的健康问题，这对“预防为主”方针的贯彻具有根本的意义。例如在各项建筑工程设计中，应使每一建筑物（尤其是工厂）的通风、照明、取暖、散热、排尘等装置合于卫生要求。在城市和工矿区的建设中的上下水道设计，特别是工厂废水的处理方法也要合乎卫生要求。在整修堤垸和整理灌溉沟渠时，可考虑消灭钉螺以预防血吸虫病。在修筑铁路和公路时，注意勿使路旁造成死水沟塘，以致孳生蚊子而人为地制造疾病的流行（如疟疾）。我国农田水利正在大力兴办，据邓子恢副总理在全国农业劳动模范代表会议上指出，在1956年里全国共修建小型水库二万七千多座，修筑渠道和塘坝三百八十多万处；又据全国农业展览会展出资料，全国农田灌溉面积在1956年已增长到五亿亩；这都说明永久性和暂时性积水面积的广为扩大，为蚊子的孳生创造了条件，因而不能不考虑到蚊媒疾病（疟疾、丝虫病等）的可能扩大，而应该预先会同卫生部门进行相应的预防措施。农业上必须利用的人粪和有机垃圾是肠道传染病和寄生虫病的主要来源，应该由农业部门与卫生部门共同研究推广堆肥、贮粪和制造颗粒肥料等方法，做到既可消灭病源而仍能保持其肥料价值。还有在一些大工程建设工地，由于工人集中，一般生活设施比较简陋，更应先行周密考虑工人的健康；对开垦地区应先作自然界野生动物间的流行病和传播疾病的昆虫调查，并制定预防措施，免使开垦人员遭受疾病。另外，关于开展群众性的体育运动，对提高人民体质有积极意义，需要有关各方面的积极支持和指导。节制生育的政策，关系国家经济建设和下一代国民的体质至为重要，这一件事不是一下子可以做好，有待各有关机关、团体广为宣传贯彻。
    我国古代医学经典著作内经素问中有“是故圣人不治已病治未病”之语，我国古代医家也早已认为保护人民健康最有效的办法是在疾病没有发生以前进行预防。这是完全正确的。现在为全人民健康服务的完善的保健网已飞跃地在优越的社会主义制度里形成了，为了进一步提高保健组织机构的工作效力，我提出了关于贯彻“预防为主”方针的几点不成熟的意见。本届许多政协委员已联合具名提出了关于贯彻“预防为主”方针的提案，我个人拟再在这里呼吁一次：建议卫生部和有关部门举行一次全国性的贯彻“预防为主”方针的学习运动，并制定相应办法来贯彻执行，使我国人民保健事业有更全面的进步，以保证经济文化建设的迅速完成。（附图片）
