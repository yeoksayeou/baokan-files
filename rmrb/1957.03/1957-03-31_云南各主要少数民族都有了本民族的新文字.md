Xinhua News Agency: The Scientific Discussion Meeting on Language and Writing Issues of Minority Ethnic Groups in Yunnan Province, which concluded on the 27th, adopted seven ethnic language writing schemes (drafts) for the Lisu, Jingpo (including two writing systems, Jingpo and Dai Wa), Naxi, Kawa, Lahu, and Hani ethnic groups. From now on, the major minority ethnic groups in the Yunnan border region will all have their own new written languages.

Among the ethnic language writing schemes (drafts) adopted at the meeting, the Hani and Naxi languages are newly created. Because the Hani people live scattered and there are great differences in local dialects, two Hani languages were adopted for different dialect areas. These two languages have the same form and spelling method, which will make future unification easy. The Naxi people used hieroglyphs in the past. This time, a new Latin-based phonetic alphabet was discussed and adopted. The new writing schemes for the remaining Lahu, Kawa, Lisu, and Dai Wa (a branch of the Jingpo ethnic group) were all drafted based on reforms of their original writing systems. The original Jingpo language was already in wide use, so the new scheme basically retained the original script, except for changes to individual letters.

Prior to this, the Lisu, Jingpo, Kawa, Lahu, Hani, and Naxi ethnic groups, except for the Jingpo ethnic group whose original phonetic writing was already widely used, did not have complete writing systems. Some ethnic groups still relied on primitive methods of knot-tying to record events, some used objects and pictographic symbols to express meanings, and some had only simple syllabic characters. To help the development of each ethnic group, the People's Government has dispatched language scholars to investigate the languages and writings of ethnic minorities in Yunnan since 1952. After several years of investigation and research and soliciting opinions from public leaders and representatives of various ethnic groups, the above-mentioned ethnic language schemes were formulated this year.

### 云南各主要少数民族都有了本民族的新文字

    云南各主要少数民族都有了本民族的新文字
    新华社讯　27日结束的云南省少数民族语言文字问题科学讨论会上，通过了傈僳、景颇（包括景颇和戴佤两种文字）、纳西、佧佤、拉祜、哈尼等民族文字方案（草案）七种。从此，云南边疆的各主要少数民族都有了本民族的新文字。
    会议通过的这些民族文字方案（草案）中，哈尼文和纳西文是属于新创立的。由于哈尼族人民居住分散，各地方言差别很大，因此通过了不同方言区的两种哈尼文字。这两种文字的形式、拼写方法相同，将来统一也很方便。纳西族人民过去使用的是象形文字，这次讨论通过了拉丁拼音的新文字；其余拉祜、佧佤、傈僳、戴佤（景颇族的一支）新文字方案都是根据它们原有的文字基础经改革后拟订的。原来的景颇文使用范围已经较广，所以新方案中除个别字母有改动外，基本保留了原有文字。
    在此以前，傈僳、景颇、佧佤、拉祜、哈尼、纳西等民族，除景颇族原有的拼音文字已使用较广外，其它民族都没有完备的文字，有的民族还靠原始的结绳方法记事，有的使用实物、象形符号表意，有的只有简单的音节文字。为了帮助各个民族的发展，从1952年起，人民政府就派遣了语言科学工作者对云南的少数民族语言文字进行调查。经过几年来的调查研究并广泛征求了各民族公众领袖和代表人物的意见，今年才制订了上述各种民族文字的方案。
