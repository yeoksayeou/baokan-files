    On a Torpedo Boat
    Qin Mu
    The Pearl River meanders thousands of miles into the ocean,
    Reluctant to part as it bids farewell to the land.
    Suddenly the river becomes wider and broader,
    Gently embracing the green fields and farms.
    Mudskippers dance on the banks, teal shadows float on the river's heart,
    The vast expanse of the river, boundless and misty.
    Dense rows of fighting ships,
    Berth in the enormous bosom of the naval port.
    As a fortunate guest of the Southern Fleet,
    We embark on a torpedo boat to sail among the fleet,
    Inquiring about the power of each warship,
    Like children counting the stars in the sky.
    Imposing is the cruiser,
    Gaping wide is the landing ship,
    The minesweeper is entirely made of wood,
    Gunboats, oil tankers, torpedo boats, countless.
    The torpedo boat is our sentry on the sea,
    Pairs of torpedo tubes like a warrior's eyes.
    Should enemy ships dare to spy on our territorial waters,
    The torpedo launch will be like a shooting star on a summer night.
    The torpedo boat is our sea cheetah,
    More agile than a rabbit in the forest.
    A roar startles a distant flock of teal,
    The warship seems to soar on pillars of waves.
    Far away in the distance lies Humen,
    Let us commemorate the generals who fought and died there a hundred years ago.
    This vast expanse of flowing water is our nation's gateway,
    Upon it, no longer flies the flags of imperialism.
    Laughing, we let the waves splash on our faces,
    Laughing, we let the wild wind tear at our clothes.
    Everyone vies to see the driver's heroic spirit,
    He is like a marble statue of a hero.
    When the torpedo boat returns to base,
    Countless warships appear before our eyes again.
    Facing the fighting floating city on the river,
    What surges is passion and also tenderness.
    The river flows day and night,
    You are no longer China's wounded veins,
    The shame written by enemy flags,
    Has now been washed completely clean.
    Each warship is the language of the Chinese people,
    They form a magnificent poem.
    Each warship is the syllable of the Chinese people,
    They soar with unrestrained songs.
    Strong sailors on the warships form a human wall,
    The ribbons on their hats flutter in the wind.
    Please, clear breeze on the river, accept our entrustment,
    Kiss the faces of these young warriors.
    With deep affection, we gaze at the fleet once more,
    As if gazing at a lover,
    That our great-grandfathers, when they were young men,
    Yearned for generation after generation until today.

    在鱼雷艇上
    秦牧
    珠江蜿蜒千里流入海洋
    和陆地临别好像难舍难分
    江水忽然变得又宽又广
    温柔地绕着绿野和田庄
    滩上跳着泥鱼，江心浮着凫影
    辽阔的江面莽莽苍苍
    密层层一列列战斗的舰艇
    停泊在军港巨大的胸膛上
    做南方舰队的幸运客人
    让鱼雷艇载我们在船队间航行
    叩问着一艘艘舰艇的威力
    像孩童数着天上的星辰
    威风凛凛的是巡洋舰
    张着大口的是登陆舰
    扫雷艇全身都是木材
    炮舰、油船、鱼雷艇数也数不清
    鱼雷艇是我们海上的哨兵
    一对对鱼雷筒像是战士的眼睛
    敌舰要是敢来窥伺我们的领海
    鱼雷发射就会像夏夜的流星
    鱼雷艇是我们海上的猎豹
    它比森林里的野兔还要机灵
    一阵吼声惊起远处的凫阵
    战艇就像在浪柱上飞腾
    茫茫远处就是虎门
    让我们凭吊百年前奋战身死的将军
    这片浩浩的流水是我国的门户
    上面再也没有帝国主义的旗旌
    笑着让浪花飞溅到我们脸上
    笑着让狂风撕着我们的衣裳
    大家争看驾驶员的豪迈气概
    他就像是一尊大理石的英雄塑像
    当鱼雷艇回到基地
    无数舰艇又呈现在我们眼前
    面对着江上战斗的浮城
    涌起的是激情也是柔情
    日夜奔流的大江
    你如今已不是中国受伤的血管
    敌人军旗写下的耻辱
    如今已经洗涤得干干净净
    一艘艘舰艇是中国人民的语言
    它们组成一首雄壮的诗篇
    一艘艘舰艇是中国人民的音节
    它们飞扬着豪放的歌声
    舰艇上健壮的水兵排成了人墙
    帽子上的飘带正随风飘卷
    请江上的清风接受我们的委托
    吻一吻这些年轻战士的脸庞
    怀着款款深情再瞧舰队一眼
    就像是凝视着情人一样
    当我们的曾祖父还是年轻人
    就世代对它害相思直到今天
