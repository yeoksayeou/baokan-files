Xinhua News Agency, Accra dispatch: Gold Coast Prime Minister Nkrumah said at a meeting of the People's Convention Party on the 24th that after the Gold Coast gains independence in March, it will enter a period of national construction. Nkrumah is the lifelong chairman of the ruling People's Convention Party.

He said the goal of construction is to achieve full employment and develop the country. This will prioritize the full development of water resources, followed by the construction of roads, the establishment of electricity, postal, and telephone services, and the construction of housing. He also said that this plan would be submitted to the new Ghanaian parliament for approval within a year.

Xinhua News Agency, March 1st dispatch from Washington: U.S. Vice President Nixon left Washington on February 28th to attend the independence ceremony of the Gold Coast (Ghana) on March 6th.

In addition to visiting Ghana, Nixon will also visit Morocco, Liberia, Uganda, Ethiopia, Sudan, Libya, and Tunisia. He will also visit Italy. In these countries, Nixon will hold negotiations with government officials as Eisenhower's personal representative.

Nixon said when leaving Washington National Airport that he was making this visit as Eisenhower's representative, which showed that the United States was "very concerned about Africa, this increasingly important continent."

The Associated Press, in commenting on Nixon's trip, pointed out that its purpose was to: "Show that the U.S. government is very interested in Africa and sees it as a Western fortress in the struggle between East and West." United Press said that Nixon's mission was to "find friends in Africa." It also said that Nixon would discuss the somewhat unstable economic problems of Libya, where the United States has the giant Wheelus Air Base, and sound out Morocco on a new military base agreement.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Democrat Green, released a report on his visit to Africa on the 24th. He said that U.S. policy toward Africa "has failed to keep up with" the rapid economic and political development of Africa. Green complained that "overall, not enough attention has been paid, either to the needs of this vast region or to the future of Africa regarding its important interests for ourselves."

In his report, Green advocated "not encouraging the more backward African countries to implement independence too quickly."

Green said that from the standpoint of U.S. policy, "Libya is one of the most critical regions in Africa." If the United States does not give Libya "aid," "Libya will almost certainly fall completely under the influence of Egypt." He also said that whether Wheelus Airport can continue to serve as a U.S. air base will ultimately depend on the extent of U.S. "aid" to Libya.

Green also said that in the early days of Morocco's independence, it was in the U.S.'s own interest to aid Moroccans through long-term loans or by encouraging U.S. private capital investment. In Tunisia, however, U.S. private investment is difficult because of its close relationship with France. The situation may change in the near future if Tunisia's economic dependence on France decreases. He expressed hope that such a change would occur.

### 恩克鲁玛总理说  黄金海岸独立后就开始建设  尼克松前往非洲进行阴谋活动

    恩克鲁玛总理说
    黄金海岸独立后就开始建设
    尼克松前往非洲进行阴谋活动
    据新华社讯  黄金海岸阿克拉消息：黄金海岸总理恩克鲁玛24日在人民大会党的一次会议上说，黄金海岸在3月份获得独立以后，就要进入国家建设时期。恩克鲁玛是执政党人民大会党的终身主席。
    他说，建设的目标是实现充分就业和开发国家。这将要优先开发充分的水源，随后就要修筑公路，建立电业、邮政、电话事业，修建住宅。他还说，这项计划要在一年以内提交新的加纳议会批准。
    新华社1日讯  华盛顿消息：美国副总统尼克松2月28日离开华盛顿前往非洲参加黄金海岸（加纳）在3月6日举行的独立典礼。
    尼克松此行除访问加纳外，还将访问摩洛哥、利比里亚、乌干达、埃塞俄比亚、苏丹、利比亚和突尼斯。他还将访问意大利。在这些国家里，尼克松将作为艾森豪威尔的私人代表同这些国家的政府人员举行谈判。
    尼克松在离开华盛顿国民机场时说，他是作为艾森豪威尔的代表作这次访问的，这表明美国对于“非洲这个越来越重要的大陆是十分关心的”。
    美联社在评论尼克松这次旅行的时候指出，它的目的是：“表明美国政府对非洲很感兴趣，把它看成是东西方斗争中的西方堡垒。”合众社说，尼克松的使命是在“非洲找朋友”。它还说，尼克松将在美国拥有惠勒斯巨型空军基地的利比亚讨论这个国家的有几分不稳的经济问题，并且向摩洛哥试探一项新的军事基地协定的问题。
    据新华社讯  美国参议院外交委员会主席、民主党人格林24日发表了一份访问非洲的报告。他说，美国对非洲的政策“没能跟得上”非洲经济和政治上的飞速发展。格林抱怨说：“总的来看，不论是对这一巨大地区的需要或是对非洲的未来对于我们自己的重要利害关系方面，都没有给以足够的注意。”
    格林在报告中主张“不要鼓励那些比较落后的非洲国家太快地实行独立。”
    格林说，从美国政策的立场来看，“利比亚是非洲最危急的地区之一。”如果美国不给利比亚以“援助”，“利比亚几乎可以肯定将完全堕落在埃及的影响之下。”他还说，惠勒斯飞机场能否继续作为美国的空军基地，最后也要取决于美国“援助”利比亚的程度。
    格林又说，在摩洛哥获得独立的早期，通过长期贷款或者鼓励美国私人资本投资来援助摩洛哥人是符合美国自己的利益的。而在突尼斯，由于它同法国之间的关系仍然很密切，美国私人投资就很困难。假如突尼斯对法国的经济依赖减少的话，在最近的将来情况也许会有变化。他表示希望出现这种变化。
