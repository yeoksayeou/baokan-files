Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 3rd: The Soviet Union's Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Lithuania, Moldavia, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan republics began their elections for local Soviets at all levels on March 3rd (the other six republics will hold elections on March 10th and 17th respectively).

The voters in the Soviet Far East region were the first to start voting. Before dawn, radio waves already broadcasted the news of the elections taking place there.

In the Soviet capital of Moscow, the doors of all polling stations opened at six o'clock this morning. The polling station buildings were adorned with festive decorations, with beautiful election posters and red banners with the words "Everyone come to vote!" posted everywhere. Voters went to the polling stations one after another to cast their ballots. At the first polling station in the Frunze district, the first group of voters were women. Sixty-three-year-old pensioner worker Yeksterava came here at two o'clock in the morning, waiting to cast the first vote. At the seventy-third polling station in the Dzerzhinsky district, the voters were very enthusiastic. Forty minutes after the start of voting, 120 people had already cast their ballots. For those who were unable to go to the polling stations due to illness, the election committees of each district sent special personnel with sealed ballot boxes to their homes to allow them to vote.

    苏联地方苏维埃选举开始
    莫斯科等地人民踊跃投票
    新华社莫斯科3日电  苏联的俄罗斯联邦、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、乌兹别克、立陶宛、摩尔达维亚、塔吉克和土库曼共和国3日开始进行各级地方苏维埃选举（其他六个共和国将分别在3月10日和17日举行）。
    苏联远东地区的选民最先开始投票，天还未亮，无线电波就已经发出了那里进行选举的消息。
    在苏联首都莫斯科，各选举站的大门在这一天清晨六点钟就打开了。选举站的房屋披上了节日的盛装，到处都张贴着美丽的选举招贴画和写着“所有人都来选举！”的字的红色横幅标语。选民们陆续前往选举站投票。在伏龙芝区第一选举站，第一批来投票的是一群妇女。六十三岁的领养老金的女工叶克斯特拉娃在深夜二时就来到这里，等待着投第一张票。在捷尔任斯基区第七十三投票站，前来投票的选民十分踊跃，在开始投票以后四十分钟，就有一百二十人投了票。对因病不能到选举站投票的人，各选区选举委员会都派专人带着密封的投票箱送票上门，让他们投票。
