    Better Organize Western Medicine Doctors to Study Traditional Chinese Medicine
    Han Pengtai's Speech
    I completely agree with and support the reports made by Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. I am even more excited to have heard Chairman Mao's correct instructions on "Correctly Handling Contradictions Among the People" at the enlarged Supreme State Conference, which has enhanced my thinking and understanding.
    I am a medical worker, and I would like to offer some suggestions on the issue of Western medicine doctors studying traditional Chinese medicine.
    In the upsurge of marching towards science, one of the glorious and arduous tasks facing us Western medicine doctors is the issue of Western medicine doctors studying traditional Chinese medicine. This can make a significant contribution to world medicine from Chinese medicine, it can improve our medical theory and technical level, and it also plays a significant role in the current quality of medical care.
    Still Some Ideological Obstacles
    Since our medical community studied the policy of learning traditional Chinese medicine and the instructions of Vice Minister of Health Fu Lianzhang that "the key issue lies in Western medicine doctors learning traditional Chinese medicine," a new outlook has emerged in our work. First, the opposition and discrimination between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine have been basically eliminated. Second, many Western medicine doctors are humbly learning from their traditional Chinese medicine predecessors. Third, due to the cooperation between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine in medical work, some new achievements have emerged. However, the development of learning is not balanced enough, and there is a phenomenon of tightening at the beginning and then loosening. In some places, the wind of attending classes was surging at the beginning of learning, but then gradually decreased. Finally, the number became very small. The main responsibility for the occurrence of this phenomenon lies with us Western medicine doctors who are learning traditional Chinese medicine, because every Western medicine worker, especially the older ones, has a certain degree of ideological obstacles in the process of transforming their learning understanding. For example, some people think that they have been working as Western medicine doctors for many years and are confident that they have some experience in clinical work, so is it appropriate to start learning traditional Chinese medicine from scratch? Some people believe that in recent years, we have learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, which has indeed achieved great results. Soviet medicine is developing rapidly, and medicine in other countries is also constantly developing. Is it necessary to devote part of our labor to learning and researching? Moreover, now that science has entered the atomic age, it is also necessary to concentrate our efforts to welcome the advent of atomic energy medicine. Is there enough energy to study traditional Chinese medicine at the same time? Some people believe that Chinese medicine has profound and concise texts, and it is often difficult to understand the meaning even if they can recognize the words. For example, the third paragraph of "Neijing Zhiyao" "Dao Sheng" is "Those who have real people, lift up the heaven and earth, grasp the yin and yang, breathe the essence of qi, stand alone and guard the spirit, muscles like one. Therefore, it can live as long as the heaven and earth, without end. This is the way of life." The words are recognizable, but the meaning requires a lot of thought. Some people also consider the effectiveness of learning traditional Chinese medicine, that is, the comparison between the curative effect of traditional Chinese medicine and the curative effect of Western medicine, and so on.
    Difficulties Encountered in Learning
    After the education and enlightenment of the Party and our own ideological struggle, many people have decided to learn traditional Chinese medicine and shoulder the task of inheriting and developing the legacy of Chinese medicine. However, in the process of learning, we have encountered many difficult problems. For example:
    1. Is the theory of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements scientific? Is it metaphysical? Is it idealistic? Is it materialistic? It is understandable for a student of natural science to seek theoretical basis for the key issues of science. Even with argumentation, some people still doubt it.
    2. The application methods of clinical syndrome differentiation such as yin and yang, exterior and interior, cold and heat, deficiency and excess, and the relationship between them, cannot be found in detail in many books, which requires a lot of research.
    3. The eight treatment methods of warming, tonifying, clearing, dissipating, harmonizing, sweating, vomiting, and purging, each method has several prescriptions. The indications, contraindications, and flexible application methods of each method and prescription according to the syndrome are not detailed in many medical books.
    4. At present, the commonly used prescriptions include Jingfang (ancient prescriptions of Zhang Zhongjing), Shifang, prescriptions of a certain person, and pulse cases of a certain person. Many provinces have also published proven prescriptions. There are many books, each with its own arguments, making it difficult for new learners to know where to start.
    5. In classical medicine, the explanations of some terms are not consistent. For example, for Ben Tun Syndrome, Mr. Lu Yuanlei has one explanation, Mr. Yan Derun has another explanation, and Mr. Cheng Wuyan has another explanation, making it difficult for new learners to understand.
    6. The learning method is in accordance with the regulations of the higher authorities. Advanced groups study the four classics and first study the Inner Canon. They encounter difficulties when they start learning, and as a result, many people retreat in the face of difficulties. Even the elementary class learns the Three Character Classic of Medicine and the Rhyme of Herbal Properties, but they also often drop out midway because the words are shallow but the meaning is profound and difficult to understand.
    7. The time problem. The regulation of four hours of study per week is equivalent to intermittent learning for medical workers who are busy with work and still need to review old Western medicine courses and read new literature.
    With the above objective factors, the progress of Western medicine doctors learning traditional Chinese medicine is affected. However, we all agree that these difficulties are difficulties in learning methods, difficulties in the learning process, temporary difficulties, and can be completely overcome.
      Some Suggestions
    Therefore, it is suggested that: 1. The leadership should strengthen the leadership of Western medicine doctors learning traditional Chinese medicine, especially the leadership of learning ideology. It is hoped that Western medicine doctors will participate in learning completely voluntarily under the premise of improving quality. In terms of time, books, and reward system, we should give strong support. After we have gained something, we will promote it from point to area, and introduce learning experiences and conduct discussions in a timely manner.
    2. In terms of learning methods, it is hoped that it will be from shallow to deep and from easy to difficult, so as to avoid being more difficult to drill at the beginning of learning, resulting in retreating in the face of difficulties. Traditional Chinese medicine teachers hope to continuously publish the key points of learning and the key issues of traditional Chinese medicine academics, so that scholars can follow and guide the enthusiasm of learning.
    3. In the learning process, first summarize the experience, affirm the curative effect, and then further conduct research on physiology, pathology, pharmacology, and biochemistry, and improve from practice to theory. In this way, the Traditional Chinese Medicine Teaching and Research Group of colleges and universities (medical colleges) must be strengthened. However, the curative effect must be carefully published to avoid affecting the confidence of learners due to unrealistic reports.
    4. Can we consider absorbing a group of high school graduates this year and giving them to traditional Chinese medicine predecessors to take some apprentices in order to strengthen the medical work camp?
    Now the vast majority of our medical workers recognize the rich content of the legacy of Chinese medicine, and recognize that the call of the Party is correct, and the Party's policy has always been successful. We wholeheartedly follow the call of the Party, any difficulties can be overcome. On the policy of traditional Chinese medicine, we are confident that we can complete the glorious task assigned to us by the Party to inherit and develop the legacy of Chinese medicine. But it is not without difficulties, because there is no smooth road to go in science. The most important thing is that we Western medicine doctors who study traditional Chinese medicine are not afraid of hardship in climbing; we also hope that the leadership and traditional Chinese medicine predecessors will give us strong and sufficient support.

### 更好地组织西医学习中医  韩蓬台的发言

    更好地组织西医学习中医
    韩蓬台的发言
    我完全同意和拥护周总理、李副总理和陈叔通副主席所作的各项报告。更感到兴奋的，是在扩大最高国务会议上，听到了毛主席关于“正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的正确指示，提高了我的思想和认识。
    我是医务工作者，对西医学中医问题，提出一点意见。
    在向科学进军的高潮中，摆在我们西医面前光荣而艰巨的任务之一，是西医学中医的问题，它可以使我国医学对世界医学有重大的贡献，它可以使我们医学理论和技术水平，得到提高，它对当前的医疗质量来说，也起很大的作用。
    还有一定程度的思想障碍
    我们医务界自从学习了中医政策及卫生部傅连暲副部长“关键问题，在于西医学中医”的指示后，在工作中出现了新的面貌。第一、基本上消灭了中西医间的对立和歧视现象；第二、有很多的西医正在虚心的向中医前辈们学习；第三、在医疗工作中，由于中西医的合作，出现了若干新成绩。但是学习开展还不够平衡，有先紧后松的现象。有的地方初学时听课的风起云涌，以后就渐次的减少。最后则为数很少。此种现象的发生，首先负主要责任的，是我们学中医的西医，因为每一个西医工作者，尤其老一点的西医们，在转变他的学习认识过程中，是有一定程度的思想障碍的。比如有人认为从学西医到作医务工作，业已多年，自信在临床工作中有一部分经验，从头学中医是不是适当。有的人认为近年来我们学习苏联的先进经验，确实收到了很大的效果，苏联的医学正在日新月异的发展，其他国家的医学，也正在不断的发展，有必要付出一部分劳动，来学习研究，况且现在科学进入原子时代，也有必要集中力量，来迎接原子能的医学来临。同时兼学中医，精力是不是够用。有的人认为中国医学，文字深奥言简意繁，往往能认识文字而难以领会其意义。例如“内经知要”“道生”第三段是“有真人者，提挈天地，把握阴阳，呼吸精气，独立守神，肌肉若一。故能寿敝天地，无有终时。此其道生。”文字是认识，但是含义则颇费思考。也有人考虑到学习中医收到的效果问题，就是中医疗效与西医疗效的对比问题等等。
    学习中遇到的困难
    我们经过党的教育启发，及自己的思想斗争，很多的人决心学习中医，肩负起继承和发扬祖国医学遗产的任务，而在学习的过程中，又遇到很多的困难问题。例如：1．阴阳五行学说是科学的呢？是形而上学的呢？是唯心的呢？是唯物的呢？在一个学自然科学的对科学的关键问题，寻求理论根据，是可以理解的。虽然有了论证仍然有人怀疑。
    2．阴阳、表里、寒热、虚实等临床辨症的应用，方法，及其相互间的关系，很多书上找不到详尽的解释，就颇费钻研。
    3．温、补、清、消、和、汗、吐、下，八个治疗方法，每法又有若干处方，对于各法各方的适应症、禁忌症及因证施治，灵活运用的方法，在很多医学书上是语焉不详。
    4．现在一般应用处方，有经方（张仲景的古方），有时方，有某氏处方学，又有某氏脉案，很多省又有验方的出版，书籍既多，各有论点，使新学者莫知所从。
    5．在古典医学中，有的名词，解释尚欠一致，例如奔豚症，陆渊雷先生一个解释，阎德润先生又一个解释，成无言先生又一个解释，使新学者理解困难。
    6．学习方法，是按上级规定，高级组学四大经典，又先学内经，开始学习，就遇到困难，结果有许多人畏难而退，就是初级班也是学医学三字经及药性赋也多以文字虽浅，含义颇深，不易领会而中途退学。
    7．时间问题，每星期规定四小时的学习，在业务繁忙的医务工作者，尚须兼温西医旧课及阅读新的文献的情况下，等于一曝十寒。
    有了以上的客观因素，就影响了西医学中医的进展。然而，我们一致认为这些困难是学习方法上的困难，是学习过程中的困难，是暂时的困难，是完全可以克服的。
      几点建议
    因此建议：1．领导上应加强西医学中医的领导，尤其是学习思想的领导，更希望在提高质量的前提下，使西医们完全自愿的参加学习。在时间上，在图书上，在奖励制度上，均予以大力的支持，待有了收获，再由点及面的推广，并及时的互相介绍学习经验，展开讨论。
    2．在学习方法上希望由浅而深，由易到难，以免得初学时钻之弥坚，结果畏难而退。中医老师们对于学习要点，及中医学术的关键问题，希望不断的发表，以便学者有所遵循，引导学习的积极性。
    3．在学习过程中，首先总结经验，肯定疗效再进一步进行生理、病理、药理、生化的研究，由实践提高到理论。这样对高等院校（医学院）中医教研组必须加强。但疗效必须慎重发表，以避免由于不切实际的报道，影响了学习者的信心。
    4．本年度可否考虑，吸收一部高中毕业生，交给中医前辈们带一些徒弟，以壮大医务工作的阵营。
    现在我们绝大多数医务工作者，认识到祖国医学遗产的丰富内容，更认识到党的号召是正确的，党的政策向来是成功的，全心全意的遵从党的号召，任何困难是可以克服的，在中医政策上，我们有信心是能够完成党交给我们继承和发扬祖国医学遗产这一光荣任务的。但是并不是没有困难，因为在科学上是无有坦平的道路可走的。首要的是我们学中医的西医们，在攀登上不畏艰苦；更希望领导上，中医前辈们，给我们以大力的、足够的支援。
