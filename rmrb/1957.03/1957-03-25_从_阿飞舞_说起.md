Starting with "Rock and Roll"
Australian writer Norman Freehill

　　On February 20th, Xinhua News Agency released a dispatch from Jakarta stating that due to public pressure, the Bandung police authorities had banned American "Rock and Roll" performances.

　　This measure was taken after all the newspapers in Bandung and five youth organizations accused the so-called dance of being "obscene," and the Bandung City Council also passed a resolution condemning the "dance party."

　　This public outrage in Indonesia was triggered by a "Rock and Roll" event organized by representatives of an American film company at the Homann Hotel. Earlier, in Yogyakarta, some angry Indonesian youths had stopped a similar "Rock and Roll" event held in a hotel in the city.

　　Last October, in Paris, many police officers were deployed from the Place Blanche to the Place Pigalle on Boulevard de Clichy (one of Paris's famous, or rather infamous, nightclub districts) because a "Rock and Roll" film was being shown at the famous Moulin Rouge cinema. The police were afraid that Paris would also experience the kind of hysteria that "Rock and Roll" marathon performances had brought to Stockholm and the Netherlands.

　　What exactly is "Rock and Roll"? Its English name is "rocking and rolling" - body twisting. Since we acknowledge that any dance has graceful movements, calling "Rock and Roll" a dance is simply nonsense. "Rock and Roll" is a kind of body twitching, wriggling, swaying action, mixed with hysterical screams and shouts.

　　The so-called "Jitterbug" danced by American jazz enthusiasts is just a rough spin with clothes flying around, but "Rock and Roll" is much worse.

　　It is absolutely right for Indonesian youth, the Bandung City Council, and Bandung youth groups to denounce "Rock and Roll" as vulgar and obscene. It is equally true that they call it a decadent thing.

　　This kind of frenzy is first favored and supported by the bourgeoisie, which is evidence of the corruption of the capitalist system. It is one of the signs of a corrupt and dying social system, not a sign of young people lacking morality. It is merely that some young people, because of their youth and ignorance and having nowhere to vent their abundant energy, are easily infected by this corrupting thing.

　　Things like "Rock and Roll" are exploited, supported, and funded by the bourgeoisie and its agents. They use every means to make young people mentally disturbed, so they don't think about the corrupt things around them, and they don't pay attention to the corruption, injustice, lies, oppression, and the massacres of people in dependent countries.

　　Imperialists believe that it is best to spread this poison among the youth of dependent or colonial (or former colonial) countries. Because in these countries, the youth are a strong pillar of nationalism, independence, and revolutionary movements. Therefore, for imperialists, it is very important to use all possible methods and tricks to distract young people, no matter how clumsy, harmful, or depraved these means are.

　　Psychologically, "Rock and Roll" is evil because, in addition to the eroticism that has become a characteristic of American life, it also leads people's energy and emotions into the abyss of hysteria and chaos.

　　The United States is the headquarters of various absurd sects (the most famous being the Saint Ruler sect). The primitive twisting, roaring, and large-scale hysterical activities of these sects may be the ideological source of "Rock and Roll." American monopoly capital openly used these scandalous sects as early as the beginning of this century, such as the so-called "evangelist" Billy Sunday and his ilk. Their task was to persuade workers at mass gatherings to be satisfied with the little wages paid to them by the bosses while they were alive because they would "be rewarded after death!"

　　Other famous evangelists, such as Aimee Semple McPherson, have earned millions of dollars. Recently, a clever evangelist, Billy Graham, was considered by the American bourgeoisie as a useful talent for distorting socialist countries and their movements in the minds of the people, and therefore paid him huge sums of money to conduct regular broadcasts to Europe.

　　This "Rock and Roll" "scam" must be linked to another means used by American monopoly capital to corrupt the minds of young people, especially Asian youth. This is the so-called "comic books" that they publish, which are very low-level and full of bestiality. These comic books portray the Soviets and all other "Reds" as the lowest of human beings, and often depict the Chinese as somewhat like murderers. All of this is to stir up hatred and disgust for humanity in the hearts of children, and to conceal the truth from them.

　　These "comic books" are so crude that even capitalist countries have had to rebuke them due to public pressure. But this is only the case in the East - for example, in India. India has banned the screening of American films that depict the same thing as these comics - films that present colonial people from a distorted point of view.

　　The United States is the headquarters of various activities that corrupt the minds of its own youth, and even American scientists and psychologists admit that these activities are the root cause of murders, drug abuse, and various degenerate acts committed by American teenagers.

　　If a country openly and secretly spends millions of dollars on various corrupt activities - from pornographic and horrific literature to the Ku Klux Klan and even the prostitution industry - then what good things can people expect such a country to do?

　　If a careful investigation is carried out, it can be found that all these activities aimed at misleading the broad masses of the people are for the purpose of making profits for some organizations or individuals.

　　Like all of America's "business scriptures," capitalists can of course make money from "Rock and Roll." The famous capitalist in this "business scripture" is a person named Elvis Presley. His income last year was estimated at one million dollars, and this year he hopes to earn two million dollars. Only the world's largest capitalists earn more than him.

　　Presley's money comes from the public "dances" of "Rock and Roll" organized by himself or his agents, and a larger part comes from film distribution fees and "illegal profits," as well as phonograph records and television programs. In addition, Presley also uses his "Rock and Roll's" popularity in the United States to promote lipsticks, toothpaste, and other items with his own trademark.

　　Like all capitalists' hypocrisy, Presley actually claims that he is providing young people with such entertainment only to satisfy the public's thirst for novelty. Since he is providing entertainment, he is of course entitled to be paid. He said: "If they don't want this kind of entertainment, they won't spend money." But Presley carefully avoids mentioning that he has all the convenient ways to lure young people into indulging in his "entertainment" through music, radio, television, and newspapers.

　　Only in the United States, where the high-profile "Western cultural supremacy" is sung the loudest, has such a decadent "Rock and Roll" been produced. Unfortunately, due to the bad influence of American films, and because the United States monopolizes a large part of the world's cinemas, some young people in many countries have become addicted to depraved and vulgar hobbies. Its decadent ideology has spread like an infectious disease. It attacks those with the weakest resistance like germs; and in this regard, the "weakest resistance" are those young people who are culturally and politically the most backward.

　　But it is different from general infectious diseases, and its spread does not come suddenly. It is very similar to the bacteriological warfare conducted by the United States in those years, but this time it is carried out in a different field. Because this infectious disease, like bacteriological warfare, is consciously and systematically spread by people. Although personal profit is the direct motive for spreading this poison, the fact that this thing is accepted by the mouthpieces of monopoly capital (such as newspapers, radio stations, and television) shows that they recognize that this thing is useful to them.

　　Eastern countries must resolutely oppose these scandalous activities of the United States. These countries have long suffered from the oppression and exploitation of imperialism and have been treated inhumanely; these countries have been slandered by the Western bourgeoisie as "backward" and "uncivilized." And the protest against Western decadent culture is precisely from these countries. (Special contribution to this newspaper, translated by Ge) (with pictures)

### 从“阿飞舞”说起

　　从“阿飞舞”说起
　　澳大利亚作家　诺曼·弗利希尔
    2月20日，新华社发布了一则雅加达的消息说：由于公众的压力，万隆警察当局已经禁止举行美国“阿飞舞”表演会。
    这一措施是在万隆所有报纸和五个青年组织指责这种所谓舞蹈是一种“猥亵”行为以后采取的，同时万隆市议会还通过了一项谴责这种“舞会”的决议。
    印度尼西亚公众的这种愤慨，是由于美国影片公司的代表在荷曼旅馆组织了一次“阿飞舞”会而引起的。早些时候，在日惹，一些出于忿怒的印度尼西亚青年曾经制止了在该市一旅馆中举行的类似的“阿飞舞”会。
    去年10月，在巴黎，从白色广场到克里希大街的比卡勒广场（这里是巴黎著名的或者说臭名远扬的夜总会地区之一），都布置了许多警察，因为当时在很有名的红色磨坊电影院里正在上映一部“阿飞舞”的影片。警察们害怕巴黎也像在斯德哥尔摩和荷兰那样——“阿飞舞”马拉松表演带来了歇斯底里的狂乱行为。
      “阿飞舞”究竟是个什么玩艺儿呢？它的英文名字是摇摇摆摆——身体的扭动。既然我们承认任何舞蹈都有优美的动作，那么把“阿飞舞”称作舞蹈就简直是瞎扯。“阿飞舞”是一种身体抽搐、扭拧、摇曳的动作，并掺和着一片歇斯底里的狂呼乱叫。
    美国爵士舞迷所跳的那种所谓“爵士音乐狂舞”只是一种粗野的旋转和衣服乱飞，而“阿飞舞”比它更糟糕得多。
    印度尼西亚青年、万隆市议会和万隆的青年团体斥责“阿飞舞”下流和猥亵，这是一点不错的。他们把它称之为堕落的东西，也同样是千真万确的。
    这种狂乱的东西首先受到资产阶级的偏爱和支持，这就是资本主义制度的腐朽的证据。它是腐朽的和垂死的社会制度的征候之一，而不是青年人没有德性的征象。这仅仅是有些青年人因为年幼无知，充沛的精力无处发泄，因而容易受到这种腐化东西的感染。
    像“阿飞舞”这类狂乱东西，是被资产阶级及其代理人所利用并得到他们的支持和资助的。他们用尽一切办法使青年人心神恍惚，不去思索他们周围的腐败事物，不去留心那些贪污腐化、不公平、谎言、压迫以及附属地人民遭受屠杀的种种事情。
    帝国主义者认为最好是在附属国或殖民地（或前殖民地）国家的青年当中散播这种毒素。因为在这些国家里的青年是民族主义、独立和革命运动的强有力的支柱。因此，对帝国主义者来说，运用一切可能的方法，施展各种各样的诡计来分散青年人的注意力，是十分重要的，不管这些手段是如何的笨拙，如何的害人和如何的堕落。
    从心理学上讲，“阿飞舞”是邪恶的，因为它除了已经成为美国生活方式的特色的色情狂以外，还把人的精力和情绪引入歇斯底里和混乱的深渊。
    美国是各种荒诞无稽的教派的大本营（最著名的要算圣罗勒教派）。这些教派的那种原始的扭动、咆哮和大规模的歇斯底里活动可能是“阿飞舞”的思想渊源。美国垄断资本早在本世纪的初期就公开利用这些伤风败俗的教派，例如所谓“布道家”毕莱·逊德之流。他们的任务就是在群众集会上劝导工人们在活着的时候满足于大老板所付给他们的一点工资，因为他们“死后将会得到好报！”
    另一些著名的布道家像阿·塞·马克弗逊之流，曾经赚了数百万美元。最近出现的一个机灵的布道家贝黎·格累谟，被美国资产阶级认为是使人民曲解社会主义国家和它们的各项运动的一个有用之才，因而付给他巨额的款项去对欧洲进行经常的广播。
    必须把这种“阿飞舞”“骗局”同美国垄断资本用以败坏青年、特别是亚洲青年的心灵的另一个手段联系起来看。这就是他们出版的那些十分低级的和充满兽性的所谓“滑稽画报”。这类画报把苏联人和所有其他“红党”描绘成最下等的人类，时常把中国人画得有点像凶手。这一切都是为了在孩子们的心中掀起对人类的仇恨和憎恶，为了对孩子们隐瞒事物的真相。
    这类“滑稽画报”粗野到如此地步，甚至同是资本主义国家也不得不顾及公众的压力而予以斥责。但是这只是在东方——例如在印度才是这样。印度已经禁止上映和这类画刊作同样描写的美国影片——用歪曲事实的观点来表现殖民地人民的影片。
    美国是败坏本国青年心灵的各种活动的大本营，甚至美国自己的科学家和心理学家也承认这些活动是美国少年进行谋杀、吸毒和各种堕落行径的根源。
    一个国家竟然公开地和秘密地把成百万的美元用于各种腐败活动——从色情的和恐怖的文学到三K党以至于卖淫事业，那末人们还能期望这样一个国家做出什么好事情呢？
    如果作一番仔细的调查，就可以发现所有这些旨在把广大人民群众引入歧途的活动都是为了使一些组织或者个人从中谋利。
    一如美国的各种“生意经”，资本家当然也是可以在“阿飞舞”上捞钱的。搞这行“生意经”的著名的资本家是一个叫爱·普勒斯莱的人。他去年的收入据估计有一百万美元，而今年他希望挣到两百万美元。只有世界上最大的资本家才会比他捞得多些。
    普勒斯莱的钱是从他自己或他的代理人所组织的“阿飞舞”的公开“舞会”上搞来的，而更大一部分来自影片发行费和“非法利益”以及留声机唱片和电视节目。除此以外，普勒斯莱还利用他的“阿飞舞”在美国的吃香，来推销以本人作商标的口红、牙膏等物品。
    同所有的资本家的假冒为善一模一样，普勒斯莱居然宣称：他向年青人提供这样一种娱乐只是在满足公众对新鲜事物的渴求。既然是提供娱乐，他当然就有资格得到报酬了。他说：“如果他们并不想要这种娱乐的话，他们就不会花钱的。”可是普勒斯莱小心翼翼地避不谈及的是，他拥有一切方便的门路通过音乐、广播、电视和报纸来引诱青年沉迷于他的“娱乐”。
    只有在“西方文化至上”的高调唱得最响的美国，才会产生出了如此堕落的“阿飞舞”来。不幸的是，由于美国影片的恶劣影响，而且由于美国垄断了世界上一大部分电影院，许多国家的一部分青年已经染上了堕落和下流的嗜好。它的糜烂思想已经像传染病一般流行起来了。它就像病菌那样进攻那些抵抗力最弱的人；而在这方面“抵抗力最弱的人”便是那些在文化上和政治上最最落后的青年。
    但是它不同于一般的传染病，它的流行不是突然而来的。它很像当年美国所进行的细菌战争，不过这一次是在不同的领域内进行。因为这种传染病，正像细菌战争那样，它是被人们有意识地、有组织地加以散布的。虽然个人谋利是散布这种毒素的直接动机，但是这种东西被垄断资本的喉舌（如报刊、电台、电视）所接受，这就说明了它们是承认这种东西对它们有用处的。
    东方国家必须坚决反对美国这些伤风败俗的活动。这些国家曾经长期遭受帝国主义的压迫和剥削，受到非人的对待；这些国家被西方资产阶级污蔑为“落后”和“未开化”。而对西方堕落文化的抗议正是从这些国家发出的。（本报特约稿　葛译）（附图片）
