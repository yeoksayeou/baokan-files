    Strive to Exceed the Unprecedentedly Bumper Harvest of 1956 in Total Output of Grain, Cotton, and Oil Crops
    Hubei's Spring Ploughing Campaign Gathers Great Momentum
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 2nd - A spring ploughing campaign characterized by "early action, high morale, and great momentum" has been enthusiastically launched in Hubei Province. Currently, 560,000 people in the areas along the Yangtze River and around the lakes are participating in the annual maintenance of dykes and embankments, and a large number of workers are continuing to join, guaranteeing the completion of the maintenance project before "Qingming" (Tomb-Sweeping Day). In the western Hubei regions of Xiangyang and Yichang, where farmland water conservancy work was already well-done last winter, about 70% of the water conservancy construction plan has now been completed. Farmers in counties such as Xiangyang, Zaoyang, and Guanghua have converted more than 400,000 mu of low-yielding dry land into high-yielding paddy fields. Agricultural cooperatives in the Enshi mountainous area have launched an advanced producer movement, making rapid and effective progress in spring ploughing. To date, the entire region has built and renovated more than 26,000 large and small reservoirs, ponds, channels, and drainage projects, completing 91% of the original plan. At the same time, more than 22,000 mu of sloping land and dry land have been converted into terraced fields and paddy fields. In the Huanggang area of eastern Hubei, where farmland water conservancy work progressed relatively slowly last winter, more than 600,000 people have been engaged in a concentrated effort since the Spring Festival. In the past half-month alone, five counties including Xinzhou and Huanggang have repaired more than 8,300 large and small ponds. Farmers in various areas also have a high enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer. At present, the amount of fertilizer accumulated throughout the province has reached about 60% of the amount needed for spring ploughing.
    This year, Hubei Province's total output of grain, cotton, and oil crops is to increase by 7%, 10% to 15%, and 39.1% respectively compared to last year's unprecedentedly bumper harvest. Compared with the requirements for achieving this increase in production, it has been widely found in various areas that there is a shortage of labor, fertilizer, draft animals, and farm tools. Therefore, farmers have come up with many ways to overcome these difficulties in the spring ploughing.
    The shortage of labor is a prominent problem brought about by the implementation of agricultural technology reforms centered on the "five improvements." In addition to improving management and fully utilizing the role of each laborer, agricultural cooperatives in various areas have also vigorously mobilized members to create and modify many new farm tools that can improve work efficiency. The Tuanjie Agricultural Cooperative in Tianmen County has created eight new farm tools, such as three-wheeled ox carts and cotton strip sowing machines, which can save a lot of labor. The county has decided to vigorously promote these this year. In solving the problem of insufficient manure, farmers, in addition to massively collecting pond mud, lake grass, and accumulating human and animal manure, have also come up with many ways to dig up fertilizer sources. Farmers in Huangpi County, for example, have adopted methods such as replacing stoves and digging drainage ditches to accumulate 40 million dan of fertilizer in a concentrated effort. In order to enhance the physical strength of livestock and improve labor efficiency, various areas have generally increased the feeding of concentrated feed to livestock, renovated cattle pens, and assigned special personnel for grazing. Agricultural cooperatives in counties such as Hanyang and Huangpi have also designated special personnel to train the grown-up calves so that they can learn to plow the fields before spring ploughing. Workers in local state-owned farm tool factories and farm tool handicraft cooperatives in various areas have also gone to the countryside to help farmers manufacture and repair farm tools. In the two counties of Echeng and Yangxin alone, workers have recently manufactured and repaired more than 17,000 large and small farm tools such as plows and harrows for 600 agricultural cooperatives.

    争取粮食、棉花、油料总产量超过空前丰收的1956年
    湖北备耕运动声势浩大
    新华社武汉2日电  以“动手早、劲头足、声势大”为特点的备耕运动，已在湖北省热烈地展开。目前，沿江滨湖地区有五十六万人参加堤防岁修，大批民工还在不断上堤，他们保证在“清明”前完成岁修工程。去年冬天农田水利工作就搞得不错的鄂西襄阳、宜昌地区，现在水利兴修计划已经完成70％左右；襄阳、枣阳和光化等县的农民已把四十多万亩低产旱地改为高产水田。恩施山区的农业社开展了先进生产者运动，备耕工作搞得又快又好。到目前止，全区已经兴建和整修好的大小水库、塘堰、渠道和排水工程等共有两万六千多处，完成原订计划91％；同时还把两万二千多亩坡地和旱地改为梯田和水田。鄂东黄冈地区，去年冬季农田水利工作进展比较缓慢，春节过后有六十多万人突击兴修，仅新洲、黄冈等五个县近半个月就修整好大小塘堰八千三百多口。各地农民积肥的热情也很高，现在全省的积肥量已达到春耕需要数的60％左右。
    今年，湖北省的粮食、棉花和油料的总产量，分别要比空前丰收的去年增产7％、10％到15％和39.1％。与实现这个增产计划的要求相比较，各地普遍发现：劳动力、肥料、耕畜和农具不足，因此，在备耕中农民想了很多办法来克服这些困难。
    劳动力不够，是推行以“五改”为中心的农业技术改革后带来的突出问题。各地农业社除改善经营管理，充分发挥每个劳动力的作用外，还大力发动社员创造和改制了很多能够提高工效的新农具。天门县团结农业社，创造了三轮牛车、棉花条播机等八种新农具，可以大量节省劳动力，这个县决定今年大力推广。在解决粪不足的问题上，农民们除大量挑塘泥、捞湖草、积人畜粪外，还想很多办法挖肥源。黄陂县农民就是采取换炉灶、挖阴沟等办法突击积肥四千万担。为了增强牲畜体力提高劳役效率，各地普遍给牲畜加喂精料，整修牛栏，专人放牧；汉阳、黄陂等县的农业社还确定专人训练已长成的小牛，让它们在春耕前学会犁田。各地地方国营农具厂和农具手工业社的工人，也纷纷下乡帮助农民制造整修农具，仅鄂城、阳新两个县，工人们最近就给六百个农业社制造修整好犁、耙等大小农具一万七千多件。
