How I Perform "Lin Chong's Night Flight"
Hou Yongkui

    After returning to Beijing from the North-South Kunqu Opera Performance in Shanghai, I received letters from some literary and art groups and audience members, asking me to talk about how I perform "Lin Chong's Night Flight." Due to my low level of education, I am inevitably limited in my analysis of the script and characters. However, I think I should still talk to comrades who care about Kunqu Opera art as much as possible, based on what I can understand.

    "Lin Chong's Night Flight" is a scene from "The Precious Sword," written by the Ming Dynasty writer Li Kaixian. It describes the process of Lin Chong being forced to Liangshan after burning the hay depot, daring not to travel during the day, and hurrying at night. This section mainly expresses his complex feelings on the road, thinking of his youthful ambitions; thinking of Gao Qiu's hatred for framing him; and thinking of his mother and wife with grief, anxiety, and revenge. Lin Chong is an upright, strong, and generous hero in Water Margin. Just because of his momentary anger, he killed Gao's treacherous servants, offended Gao Qiu, and caused him to be displaced and his family to be destroyed. His joining Liangshan was not out of fear of the power of treacherous officials, but to wait for an opportunity to avenge his deep hatred.

    I started performing in serious plays at the age of fifteen, and the first play was "Lin Chong's Night Flight." At that time, because I was young and all the plays were learned from the old masters through "oral instruction and heart reception," on the stage, I was like reciting a book, performing exactly as I had learned. I couldn't understand how to study the plot and create character images at all, only relying on a good voice and kung fu in my waist and legs to win the audience's welcome.

    As I grew older, in the continuous performances, this play received attention and guidance from some senior artists such as Tao Xianting, Hao Zhenji, and Wang Yiyou. I began to understand that body movements and character characteristics are closely related, and I felt that my previous body movements needed to be continuously enriched and modified to better fit the plot and character requirements.

    I came to Beijing to perform at the age of twenty-three. I eagerly hoped to gain a deeper artistic achievement. I was very honored to have the opportunity to learn from the senior artist Shang Heyu, and I received a lot of benefits from Mr. Shang. Many of the performances in "Night Flight" related to the characters' inner emotions and body movements were helped and modified by Mr. Shang. For example, in the "Shou Jiangnan" aria, "Ignoring the wind and rain, I spend the cool night," I used to use a simple wave palm followed by a single shoulder pose. Mr. Shang felt that this was flat and weak, and could not properly express the twists and turns Lin Chong had suffered. Under his guidance, I later changed to using a wave palm, straddling leg, single leg turn, somersault, and a single shoulder pose. This not only combined the lyrics but also met the requirements of Lin Chong's character. Another example is the sentence "Bēi háo tàn yīngxióng qì zěn xiāo" (Sorrowfully sighing, how can the hero's spirit be dispelled) in the "Yan'er Luo" aria. Originally, only the actions of patting the chest, turning around, and spreading the palm were used in the pose, which gave people the feeling of being pessimistic, disappointed, and helpless. Later, it was changed to shaking hands, straddling the tiger, then connecting the cloud hand somersault, clapping hands, padding steps, and spreading the palm pose. This not only made up for the shortcomings of the previous performance but also showed the hero's angry mood. Mr. Shang always taught me earnestly. He often said: "An actor must resemble what he is acting as. Each character has its own different points. If you can't distinguish them, the acting will not be like it." This means that the actor must grasp the characteristics of the character's personality and the proper thoughts and feelings, so that the performance can have a sense of reality. Indeed, if an actor does not fully understand what kind of person he is playing, it is difficult to accurately express the emotions of the role.

    Someone once suggested that I perform "Lin Chong's Night Flight" in the style of Peking Opera, believing that this would be both lively and suitable for singing the grand finale. I myself have a different view on this. If I follow the Peking Opera style, I need to add Xu Ning chasing Lin Chong, and Wang Lun from Liangshan sending Du Qian and Song Wan to defeat Xu Ning and rescue Lin Chong up the mountain. It seems very lively and close to human nature, and the actor playing Lin Chong can also get a chance to breathe. However, I did not consider that this would cause some other unsolvable contradictions. First, Lin Chong's scene and emotional performance would be pulled apart and fragmented, appearing loose and weak; second, and most importantly, it would deviate from reality. According to the original description, Lin Chong's joining Liangshan was not contacted with Liangshan in advance, so how could Liangshan know that Lin Chong was coming and send Du Qian and Song Wan to rescue him? Because these problems exist, I did not adopt this suggestion. At that time, Mr. Shang also disagreed with the change. He believed that the "one-scene performance" method in Kunqu Opera, in which the actor performs from beginning to end, is very tiring, but it is very compact, and the actor's physical strength can fully bear it, and the effect is no less than the Peking Opera performance method. Until now, I still perform according to the Kunqu Opera version, but with slight modifications compared to the original version. The previous method of going to Jialan God or not appearing on stage later and "building a shelf" to speak in the back has been changed to Lin Chong having a dream. In order to express the dream state, drum sounds are added to the scene to set off the atmosphere. This treatment is both reasonable and removes the original feudal superstitious color.

### 我是怎样演“林冲夜奔”的

　　我是怎样演“林冲夜奔”的
　　侯永奎
    从上海参加南北昆剧观摩演出回京之后，曾接到一些文艺团体和观众的来信，要求我谈谈是怎样演“林冲夜奔”的。由于我的文化水平很低，在对剧本和人物的分析方面难免会受到一定的限制。但是，我想还是应该根据自己所能理解到的，尽可能地和关心昆曲艺术的同志们来谈谈。
      “林冲夜奔”是明代作家李开先所著“宝剑记”中的一折。内容是描写林冲在火烧草料场之后，被逼上梁山，白天不敢行走，夜间赶路的过程。这一段主要表现他在路上，想起自己少年的抱负；想起高俅陷害自己的仇恨；想起母亲和妻子时的悲愤、焦急与复仇的种种复杂心情。林冲在水浒传里是个性格正直、刚强、豪爽的英雄。只为他一时愤怒，杀死高家奸侫，得罪了高俅，害得颠沛流离、家破人亡。他投奔梁山，并不是畏惧奸臣的势力，而是要待机报深仇。
    我十五岁开始演正戏的第一个戏就是“林冲夜奔”。当时因为年纪较小，所有的戏又是以“口传心受”的方法向老先生学的，因而在舞台上，就好像背书一样，怎样学来就怎样演，根本还不能理解应该如何去研究剧情和创造人物形象，只凭嗓子好、腰腿有功夫来博得观众的欢迎。
    随着年龄的增长，在不断的演出当中，这出戏曾受到一些老前辈如陶显庭、郝振基、王益友等先生们的重视与指导。我开始懂得身段动作和人物性格是有着紧密的关系，感觉到自己以前的身段动作还需要不断地加以丰富与修改，使之更能切合剧情和人物性格的要求。
    我二十三岁来北京演戏。自己迫切希望能从艺术上得到更深的造诣。很荣幸，不久便拜前辈艺人尚和玉老先生为师，从尚先生那里得到了不少的教益。“夜奔”中许多有关人物内心情感与身段动作的表演，都是尚先生加以帮助修改的。如“收江南”曲牌中的“顾不得风吹雨打度凉宵”一句，我从前是用简单的波浪掌接单山膀亮相。尚先生觉得这样做平而无力，不能恰当地表达出林冲所受的波折。经他指点，后来改用了波浪掌、跨腿、片腿转接鹞子翻身和一个单山膀亮相。这样既结合了唱词，又符合了林冲性格上的要求。又如“雁儿落”曲牌中的“悲号叹英雄气怎消”一句，原来只用拍胸、转身和摊掌亮相的动作，给人的感觉有些悲观失望无可奈何。后来才改用晃手、跨虎，然后再接云手翻身、拍手、垫步和摊掌亮相。这样既弥补了以前表演上的缺点，也表现出英雄的愤怒心情。尚先生总是谆谆地教导我，他常说：“一个演员要装什么像什么，每个人物都各有不同之处，如果分不清楚，装的就不像。”这就是说演员要抓住人物性格的特点和应有的思想感情，表演才能有真实感。的确，一个演员假如在没有完全理解自己所扮演的是个什么样的人物时，是很难准确地表达出角色的感情的。
    曾经有人建议，让我按京剧的路子来演“林冲夜奔”，认为这样既火爆热闹，又适合唱大轴。我自己对这一点却另有不同的看法。我若按京剧路子，里面需加上徐宁追赶林冲，梁山上王伦派杜千和宋万把徐宁击败，救出林冲上山。看起来似乎很热闹和近乎人情，扮演林冲的演员也可以得到了喘息的机会。但是，却没有考虑到这会造成另外一些无法解决的矛盾。第一，林冲的场子和情绪表演会被拉得支离破碎，显得松懈无力；第二，也是最重要的一点，就是脱离了真实。根据原作的描写，林冲的投奔梁山，事先并没有和梁山上联系过，那么梁山上又怎样能知道林冲来投而派杜千和宋万去搭救呢？因为存在着这些问题，所以我没有采纳这个建议。当时尚先生也不同意改，他认为昆曲里“一场干”的表演方法，由演员一人从头到尾的演下来虽很吃力，但非常紧凑，演员的体力也完全可以担负，效果也并不减于京剧路子的表演方法。直到现在，我仍 是按昆曲本演出，只不过较原本稍有修改，把以前上伽兰神或后来的不上场在后面“搭架子”讲话的处理方法改成了林冲作梦。为了表示出梦境，在场面里加进了鼓声衬托气氛。这样处理即合理又除掉了原有的封建迷信色彩。
