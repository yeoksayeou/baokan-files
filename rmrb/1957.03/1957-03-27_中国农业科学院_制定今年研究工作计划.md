Xinhua News Agency: The person in charge of the newly established Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences told Xinhua reporters on the 23rd that the academy's research work plan for this year has been finalized. Some research work is about to begin.

This year, the National Fertilizer Work Conference, convened by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and relevant departments, will put forward specific plans for the research work on bacterial fertilizers, peat, farmyard manure, and chemical fertilizers. In terms of special research, there are agricultural mechanization, the cost, price, accumulation, and distribution of agricultural production cooperatives, breeding of draught animals, prevention and treatment of pig diseases, as well as the prevention and treatment of important rice diseases such as rice stem borers, rice blast, and white leaf blight.

A group of agricultural scientists will participate in the scientific investigations for formulating agricultural plans for Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces this year, focusing on studying the causes of low-yield areas, summarizing the experience of high-yield areas, and conducting scientific investigations on the cultivation of double-cropping rice north of the Nanling Mountains and in the Yangtze River Basin.

The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences will also conduct pilot work on agricultural economic zoning in Shandong Province, and at the same time, organize four comprehensive investigation teams for fruit trees, tea, mulberry, and vegetables, respectively, to go to key producing areas to investigate and study issues such as increasing production and quality and developing new areas. The Academy will also assist ethnic minority areas such as Inner Mongolia in establishing and improving agricultural and animal husbandry scientific research institutions.

The writing of "Chinese Rice Cultivation," personally led by President Ding Ying, is one of the important research works. At the same time, the editing and publishing of the Chinese Agricultural Science Bulletin, Agricultural Science Abstracts, and special collections of Chinese agricultural heritage materials will also be carried out.

In terms of carrying out international academic activities, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences will jointly hold professional conferences on rice, cotton, and other subjects with the Soviet Union, as well as conduct scientific investigation work with the German Democratic Republic.

    新华社讯　新成立的中国农业科学院负责人23日对新华社记者说，研究院今年度研究工作计划已经制定就绪。有的研究工作即将开始。
    今年，由中国农业科学院同有关部门召开的全国肥料工作会议将提出细菌肥料、泥炭、农家肥料、化学肥料等研究工作的具体方案。在专题研究方面有农业机械化，农业生产合作社的成本、价格、积累和分配，耕畜繁殖、猪病防治，以及关于水稻螟虫、稻瘟病和白叶病等重要稻病的防治等问题。
    一批农业科学家将在今年分别参加为制定山西、陕西、河南、河北、山东等五省农业规划的科学考察，着重研究低产地区的原因，总结高产地区的经验，到南岭以北和长江流域进行双季稻栽培问题的科学考察。
    中国农业科学院还将在山东省进行农业经济区划的试点工作，同时分别组织果树、茶叶、蚕桑、蔬菜等四个综合考察组，分赴重点产区考察研究提高产量品质和发展新区等问题。科学院并帮助内蒙古等民族地区建立、健全农业和牧业科学研究机构。
    由院长丁颖亲自领导的“中国稻作学”的著述工作是重要研究工作之一，同时还要进行中国农业科学通报、农业科学文摘、中国农业遗产资料专集的编辑出版工作。
    在开展国际学术活动方面，中国农业科学院将与苏联共同合作召开水稻、棉花等专业会议，以及同德意志民主共和国互相进行科学考察工作。
