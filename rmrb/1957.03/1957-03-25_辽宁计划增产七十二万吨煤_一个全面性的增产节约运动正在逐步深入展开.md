Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, March 24th. Coal mines in Liaoning Province have proposed a target of increasing coal production by 720,000 tons outside the state plan this year, and a comprehensive increase production and practice economy movement is gradually unfolding. As of March 20th, coal mines across the province had increased coal production by more than 180,000 tons.

Fushun, Fuxin, Benxi, and Beipiao, the four major coal mines in Liaoning Province, which account for one-fifth of the country's coal supply, will have a total output of 21.76 million tons this year, exceeding last year's actual output by 860,000 tons. From the perspective of this year's production conditions, Fushun Coal Mine and Fuxin Coal Mine are facing more difficulties than in previous years. Fushun Coal Mine will be carrying out capital construction, and the tasks of stripping and tunneling will increase significantly; the coal mining face conditions in Fuxin Coal Mine are changing, and thin coal seams are increasing, which will also have a great impact on coal production. However, the cadres, workers, and technicians of these coal mines are finding ways to improve the production capacity of the coal mines and expand the mining areas to increase coal production as much as possible. According to the targets that have been set, with the exception of Beipiao Coal Mine, which will slightly reduce its output compared to last year, Fushun Coal Mine has decided to strive to increase coal production by 400,000 tons, so that this year's output can continue to maintain last year's output level while undertaking arduous capital construction tasks; Fuxin Coal Mine has determined that the output of the entire mining area will increase by 540,000 tons compared to last year; Benxi Coal Mine also requires an increase of 60,000 tons of coking coal on top of the state plan task of increasing by 280,000 tons compared to last year.

One of the prominent difficulties in coal mine production in Liaoning Province this year is the shortage of pit props. In order to prevent the shortage of pit props from affecting production, all mines have generally mobilized workers to carry out the work of recycling pit props and reuse used pit props. Fuxin Ping'an Mine sets up sheds of different specifications according to the pressure of the roadway roof, changing the past practice of using full-support and full-top sheds, which wasted pit props. According to Soviet materials, technicians at Fushun Longfeng Mine are experimenting with the use of "steel bolts" to reduce the consumption of pit props. The difficult situation of insufficient pit props is gradually easing under the efforts of workers and technicians.

The current problems in the increase production and practice economy movement in coal mines in Liaoning Province are that the development of the movement is still uneven. The Fushun Coal Mine, which is progressing faster, has basically completed the mass discussion of the plan, and is now integrating the suggestions put forward by the masses in order to incorporate them into the measures plan; the Beipiao Coal Mine, which is progressing slowly, has not yet submitted the plan to the masses for discussion. Some coal mines have not done enough to mobilize the masses. Like Fushun, some mines only gave the targets to the masses without explaining the production conditions and production key points to the workers, so there was no reliable basis for discussion. In Fuxin, some mines only listened to the opinions of a portion of the workers on the plan and did not generally mobilize the masses. In addition, some mines still have more or less conservative ideas among a few cadres. These problems that hinder the rapid development of the movement have begun to attract the attention of the party organizations of some mines.

### 辽宁计划增产七十二万吨煤　一个全面性的增产节约运动正在逐步深入展开

　　辽宁计划增产七十二万吨煤
　　一个全面性的增产节约运动正在逐步深入展开
    新华社抚顺24日电　辽宁省各地煤矿已经提出今年在国家计划外增产七十二万吨原煤的指标，一个全面性的增产节约运动正在逐步深入展开。到3月20日，全省煤矿已经增产了十八万多吨原煤。
    担负全国煤炭供应量五分之一的辽宁省抚顺、阜新、本溪、北票四大煤矿，今年总产量将达到二千一百七十六万吨，超过去年实际产量八十六万吨。从今年生产条件来看，抚顺煤矿和阜新煤矿都比往年有着更多的困难。抚顺煤矿要进行基本建设，剥离和掘进任务大大增加；阜新煤矿采煤掌子条件变化，薄煤层增多，这对煤的产量也都有很大影响。可是，这些煤矿的干部、工人和技术人员都在设法提高煤矿的生产能力，扩大采区，来尽量增加煤的产量。从现在已经定下来的指标看，除北票煤矿比去年产量略有降低外，抚顺煤矿已经决定努力争取增产四十万吨原煤，使今年的产量，在担负繁重的基本建设任务的情况下，继续保持去年年产量的水平；阜新煤矿确定全矿区的产量比去年提高五十四万吨；本溪煤矿也要求在比去年增加二十八万吨的国家计划任务的基础上，再增产六万吨炼焦煤。
    今年辽宁省煤矿生产的突出的困难之一是坑木供应不足。各矿为了不使因坑木缺乏而影响生产，普遍发动工人开展回收坑木工作，把使用过的坑木再利用起来。阜新平安矿按照巷道顶板压力大小来架设不同规格的棚子，改变了过去一律采用满帮满顶棚子，浪费坑木的作法。抚顺龙凤矿技术人员根据苏联资料，正在试验利用“钢栓”的办法，减少坑木消耗。坑木不足的困难局面，正在工人、技术人员努力下逐步趋向和缓。
    辽宁省各煤矿增产节约运动目前存在的问题是运动发展还不平衡。进展较快的抚顺煤矿，群众讨论计划已经基本结束，现在正在把群众提出的建议加以综合，以便订入措施计划中去；进展较慢的北票煤矿还迟迟没有把计划交到群众中去讨论。有些煤矿发动群众的工作还做得不深不广。像抚顺，有的矿只是把指标交给了群众，而没有把生产条件、生产关键向工人交代，讨论起来没有可靠依据。在阜新，有的矿也只是听取了一部分工人对计划的意见，没有普遍发动群众。另外，有的矿在少数干部中还或多或少存在着保守思想。这些阻碍运动迅速发展的问题，已开始引起有的矿党组织的注意。
