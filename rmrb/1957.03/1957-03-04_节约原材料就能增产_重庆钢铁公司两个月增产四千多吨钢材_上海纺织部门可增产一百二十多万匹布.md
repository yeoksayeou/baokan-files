Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, March 3rd: Chongqing's steel workers are striving to increase production by reducing the consumption of raw materials. In January and February, the employees of Chongqing Steel Company increased production by more than 1,800 tons of steel and more than 4,000 tons of steel products. The employees of Chongqing No. 3 Steel Plant increased production by about 900 tons of steel and 1,000 tons of steel products.

The biggest problem for these two enterprises this year is the insufficient supply of raw materials. In the movement to increase production and practice economy, the employees have tried every possible means to tap the potential for saving materials and strive to increase production through conservation. The employees of the open-hearth furnace workshop of Chongqing Steel Company actively improved raw material management and promoted advanced experiences. Since January of this year, while improving the quality, melting rate, and ingot casting rate of steel, the consumption of metal materials per ton of steel has been reduced by more than 30 kilograms compared with last year. In this way, in January alone, more than 220 tons of metal materials were saved for the country. The employees of the steelmaking workshop of Chongqing No. 3 Steel Plant vigorously reduced the consumption of molten metal. In the first two months of this year, the average metal material required per ton of steel was reduced by about 40 kilograms compared with the past, saving more than 100 tons of metal materials. The steel rolling workers of the two enterprises actively promoted the advanced experience of rolling negative tolerances, saving a lot of steel.

Due to the efforts of these two enterprises to save raw materials and management expenses, production costs have also been reduced. Chongqing No. 3 Steel Plant reduced its costs by about 320,000 yuan in two months.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 3rd: The Shanghai Textile Industry Department held a factory director meeting on the 1st, and initially determined that this year the city's state-owned and joint state-private cotton spinning and printing and dyeing factories should strive to increase production and save 70 million yuan in wealth. Among them, 50 million yuan will be achieved by increasing production.

The main method of increasing production is to make full use of the limited source of cotton to increase the production of yarn and cloth. Because some cotton-producing areas suffered natural disasters last year, the quantity and quality of cotton supplied to Shanghai this year are relatively poor. The textile industry department decided to use various types of cotton separately, appropriately spin more second-grade yarn and weave cloth with poor appearance quality, and make full use of substandard raw cotton. After changing the specifications of nineteen kinds of cotton cloth starting in March, the city (including the local textile industry system) can weave more than 1.2 million bolts of cloth.

Making full use of off-grade cotton and spinning waste is also an important aspect of increasing production this year. The Shanghai Cotton Company's warehouse has about 20,000 dan of bad cotton below grade nine, which factories were unwilling to use in the past. Now, it is planned to take it out to spin off-brand coarse-count cotton yarn, specializing in weaving various coarse cloths, coarse drill, coarse serge, etc. These types of cloth were very popular in the countryside in the past. According to the Cotton Company, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces can supply Shanghai with about 100,000 dan of this type of cotton. In addition to making full use of the spinning waste from various factories, it is estimated that at least 600,000 more bolts of cloth can be produced.

When the person in charge of the East China Textile Administration Bureau announced this year's plan for increasing production and practicing economy the day before yesterday, he clearly pointed out that the focus of increasing production and practicing economy in cotton spinning, printing, and dyeing factories this year is to make every effort to earnestly pay attention to consolidating and improving product quality, saving raw materials, and formulating reasonable material consumption quotas. Cotton spinning factories are required to reduce cotton consumption by one to one and a half jin per piece of yarn, and printing and dyeing factories are required to vigorously save dyes and chemical raw materials, and study substitutes for double dyes. All cotton spinning, printing, and dyeing factories this year must save 20 million yuan from reducing material consumption quotas, saving coal, electricity, management expenses, and working capital.

    节约原材料就能增产
    重庆钢铁公司两个月增产四千多吨钢材  上海纺织部门可增产一百二十多万匹布
    新华社重庆3日电  重庆市钢铁工人从减少原材料消耗中努力增产。在1、2月份内，重庆钢铁公司职工增产了一千八百多吨钢，四千多吨钢材；重庆第三钢铁厂职工增产的钢约九百吨，钢材一千吨。
    这两个企业今年生产的最大问题，是原材料供应不充足。职工们在增产节约运动中，千方百计地挖掘节约材料的潜力，从节约中力求增产。重庆钢铁公司小平炉车间职工积极改进原材料管理，推广先进经验，今年1月份以来，在提高钢的质量、熔炼率、注锭率的同时，每吨钢的金属料消耗比去年降低了三十多公斤。这样，仅1月份就为国家节约了二百二十多吨金属材料。重庆第三钢铁厂炼钢车间职工大力降低熔炼金属消耗，今年头两个月内平均每吨钢需用的金属材料比以前降低了四十公斤左右，节约了一百多吨金属材料。两个企业的轧钢工人们，积极推广轧制负公差的先进经验，节约了大量的钢材。
    这两个企业由于努力节约原材料和管理费用，使生产成本也降低了。重庆第三钢铁厂在两个月内，共降低了成本三十二万元左右。
    新华社上海3日电  上海纺织工业部门1日召开厂长会议，初步确定今年全市国营和公私合营棉纺织、印染工厂要争取增产节约七千万元财富。其中五千万元是依靠增加生产来实现。
    增加生产的主要方法是尽量充分地利用来源有限的棉花增产纱布。因为去年有部分产棉区遭受自然灾害，今年各地供应上海的棉花数量和质量都比较差，纺织工业部门决定把各类棉花分别使用，适当多纺一些外观质量较差的二级纱织布，尽量利用次等级的原棉。3月份起把十九种棉布规格改变以后，全市（包括地方纺织工业系统在内）可以多织一百二十多万匹布。
    充分利用级外棉花和纺纱下脚，也是今年增加生产的一个重要方面。上海市棉花公司仓库中存有约二万担九级以下的坏棉花，过去各厂都不愿用。现在，准备拿出来纺副牌粗支棉纱，专织各种粗布、粗直贡、粗哔叽等，这类布过去在农村中极受欢迎。据棉花公司了解：目前江苏、浙江两省大约还可以供给上海十万担这类棉花。再加上把目前各厂的纺纱下脚都充分利用起来，估计至少还可以多生产六十万匹布。
    华东纺织管理局负责人前天在宣布今年的增产节约方案的时候，明确指出棉纺织、印染工厂今年增产节约的重点，是要尽一切力量，切实注意巩固和提高产品质量，节约原材料和制定合理的材料消耗定额。要求棉纺织厂每件纱减用棉一斤到一斤半，印染厂要大力节约染料和化工原料，研究二重染料的代用品。所有棉纺织、印染厂今年要从降低材料消耗定额，节约煤、电和管理费用、流动资金等方面，节约二千万元。
