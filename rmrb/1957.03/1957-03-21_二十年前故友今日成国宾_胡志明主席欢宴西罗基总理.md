Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 20th: Chairman Ho Chi Minh held a grand banquet last night to entertain Premier Široký and the Czechoslovak government delegation he is leading.

　　Chairman Ho Chi Minh said at the banquet that he had known Premier Široký more than twenty years ago. He then said that although there are thousands of mountains and rivers separating Czechoslovakia and Vietnam, everyone is in the socialist family headed by the great Soviet Union and China. This is a family that is becoming increasingly united, stronger, and more developed. It has nine hundred million brothers and millions of friends - the people of Asia and Africa and peace-loving people all over the world.

　　Premier Široký then spoke, saying that the talks between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Czechoslovak government delegation had yielded good results. This meeting has further developed cooperation between the two countries and further consolidated and strengthened the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and China, and strengthened peace and friendship between all nations.

　　Široký said he was very happy to recall meeting Chairman Ho Chi Minh more than twenty years ago. He said that Chairman Ho Chi Minh is one of the most outstanding figures in the socialist revolutionary movement, the national liberation movement, and the peace movement.
