    Developing Tussah Silk Production by Utilizing Existing Oak Forests

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the national total output of tussah silkworm cocoons is planned to increase from 1.24 million dan last year to 1.48 million dan this year. The tussah silkworm cocoon producing areas are also being prepared to be expanded.

    It is estimated that there are more than 40 million mu of oak forests in the country. Only about 40% of these are currently being used to raise tussah silkworms. The Dabie Mountains in Anhui Province, the Funiu Mountains in Henan Province, and the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi Province all have large areas of oak forest, which can be used to raise tussah silkworms with only slight pruning and management. At present, these areas are actively pruning oak trees in order to utilize them as quickly as possible and develop tussah silk production.

    The strength and toughness of tussah silk are better than that of mulberry silk, rayon, or wool, and it can be woven into various high-grade clothing materials and blankets, etc. Last year, the Liaoning Provincial Tussah Silk Company solved the problem of tussah silk dyeing being unstable and not bright, and it can now be made into printed silks as bright and beautiful as mulberry silk. Tussah silk can also be woven into good insulating cloth for industrial use.

    China's tussah silk production ranks first in the world. In recent years, tussah silk fabrics produced in China have been selling well in the Soviet Union, Poland, the United Kingdom, India, and fourteen other countries.

    利用现有柞林发展柞蚕生产
    据新华社讯  今年全国柞蚕茧的总产量计划从去年的一百二十四万担增加到一百四十八万担。柞蚕茧的产区也准备加以扩大。
    据估计，全国有柞林四千多万亩。现在只有40％左右被利用来放养柞蚕。安徽省大别山区、河南省伏牛山区和陕西省秦岭山区都有大面积的柞林，只要稍加修剪整理，就可以放养柞蚕。目前这些地区正在积极修剪柞树，以便尽快地加以利用，发展柞蚕生产。
    柞蚕丝的强韧性比家蚕丝、人造丝或羊毛好，可以织成各种高级衣料和毯子等。去年辽宁省柞蚕丝绸公司解决了柞蚕绸染色不牢、不鲜艳的问题，可以制成和家蚕绸一样鲜艳美丽的印花绸。柞蚕丝还可以织成良好的绝缘布，用于工业方面。
    我国柞蚕丝的产量占世界第一位。几年来，我国出产的柞蚕绸畅销于苏联、波兰、英国、印度等十四个国家。
