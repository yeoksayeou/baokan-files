“Poor wretches” truly have the hope of completely shaking off poverty.

Jianming Cooperative's production exceeds the level of prosperous middle peasants.

All members smile with joy and shout "The cooperative is very good," "The cooperative saved our lives"

(This newspaper reports) The Jianming Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, once ridiculed as a "poor wretches' cooperative," has seen its production surpass that of wealthy middle peasants in the past. The members' standard of living has also generally risen to the level of middle peasants.

This cooperative transitioned to a higher-level cooperative in late winter of 1955. After a year of hard work, various crops achieved bumper harvests. The average grain yield per mu (approx. 0.16 acres) was 440 jin (approx. 220 kg), an increase of 66% compared to 1955; cotton was 180 jin, an increase of 125% compared to 1955; and peanuts were 270 jin, an increase of 50% compared to 1955. These yields exceeded the production levels of wealthy middle peasants in the past and completed the production targets set by the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) for achievement within twelve years ahead of schedule. The cooperative also developed diversified operations, with forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations all developing. The cooperative's orchard generated an income of more than 13,000 yuan; publicly raised cattle numbered 169, sheep 536, and pigs 150. In addition, it operated more than ten types of sideline production, such as flour mills, tofu workshops, woodworking, leatherworking, weaving, transportation, firewood gathering, and grass cutting, with an income of more than 2 million yuan. The household sideline occupations of the members also developed, with pig raising alone reaching 1,090 heads, an increase of more than 40% compared to 1955.

While developing production, this cooperative also paid special attention to saving expenses and running the cooperative diligently and thriftily. Some members once believed that the cooperative was large and "should look the part everywhere." They advocated selling the small livestock in the cooperative and buying large mules and horses; replacing all old farm tools with new, uniform ones. However, the cooperative did not do this. The cooperative educated these members and overcame their extravagant and wasteful ideas. The cooperative also implemented a financial contract system and formulated reward and punishment measures. As a result, saving expenses and running the cooperative diligently and thriftily gradually became the atmosphere of the entire cooperative. During spring plowing and sowing, the cooperative lacked more than 20 head of livestock, so members automatically used manpower instead of animal power to pull carts and plows; the large baskets, earthen baskets, and manure baskets used by the cooperative did not cost a penny and were woven by the members themselves from thorny branches collected from the mountains during production gaps; the members also repaired their own farm tools, saving all the farm tool repair costs. The total savings of the cooperative were no less than tens of thousands of yuan, thereby reducing production costs.

As a result of the autumn harvest distribution, each labor day was allocated 16 jin of grain and 8 jiao in cash; each person was allocated 1 jin of cotton and 22 jin of peanuts. The average income per household was 536.9 yuan, and the average income per person was 110.4 yuan. Except for two households with many people and few laborers whose income was 6 or 7 yuan less than in 1955, the remaining 547 member households all increased their income. According to the "three fix" production targets, this cooperative originally needed the state to supply 190,000 jin of grain; now it has a surplus of 150,000 jin to sell to the state. 92% of the members have become surplus grain households, and the 34 households with grain shortages have also been resolved by the cooperative's adjustment. The living standards of the members have generally risen to the level of middle peasants. They eat semi-thin and semi-dry food, wear cotton clothes in winter, lined clothes in autumn, and single clothes in summer. Housing has also improved greatly, with more than 200 houses newly built and renovated in the past year, and more than 200 are under construction or preparing to be built.

Currently, the cooperative has already planned its production for 1957. The plan is to reach a grain yield of 473 jin per mu, cotton 200 jin, and peanuts 300 jin. Forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production will also be developed to some extent compared to 1956.

This cooperative has 549 households. Before liberation, the lives of the people here were extremely hard, and more than 20 peasant households relied on begging for a living year-round. After land reform, the small-peasant economy could not withstand natural disasters, and in the face of disasters, they would fall and not be able to get up. The government provided 180,000 jin of grain and 400 pieces of clothing in relief every year, but many people still lived a life of insufficient food and clothing. In the autumn of 1952, cooperatives began to be established, and production improved. However, it was only after the transition to a higher-level cooperative in 1955 that there was hope of completely shaking off poverty. Now, the people here are all elated, smiling with joy, and unanimously reflecting: "The cooperative is very good," "The cooperative saved our lives," "If it weren't for the cooperative, I wouldn't even have a kang (heated platform bed)."

    “穷棒子”真正有了彻底摆脱贫困的希望
    建明社生产超过富裕中农的水平
    全社的人都喜笑颜开，欢呼“合作社好得很”，“合作社救了命”
    本报讯  曾经被人讥笑过的“穷棒子社”——河北省遵化县建明农林牧生产合作社的生产已经超过了以前的富裕中农的水平。社员的生活也已经普遍上升到了中农水平。
    这个社是在1955年冬末转为高级合作社的，经过一年的辛勤劳动，各种庄稼都获得丰收，粮食每亩平均产量四百四十斤，比1955年增加了66％；棉花一百八十斤，比1955年增加了125％；花生二百七十斤，比1955年增加了50％。这些产量，超过了以前富裕中农的产量水平，提前完成了全国农业发展纲要（草案）所规定的在十二年内达到的产量水平。社里还开展了多种经营，林业、牧业、副业都有发展。社里经营的果树，收入一万三千多元；公养牧牛一百六十九头，羊五百三十六只，猪一百五十头；此外，还经营了粉坊、豆腐坊、木业、皮业、编织、运输、打柴、割草等十多种副业生产，收入二百万多元。社员的家庭副业也有发展，只是养猪就有一千零九十头，比1955年增加了40％多。
    在发展生产的同时，这个社还特别注意节省开支，勤俭办社。有些社员曾经认为社大了，“要处处像个样子”。他们主张把社里的小牲口卖掉，买回大骡大马；把一切旧农具换成新一色的。但是，社里没有这样做。合作社对这些社员进行了教育，克服了他们铺张浪费的思想。社里还实行了财务包干，制订了奖惩办法，这样，节省开支、勤俭办社就逐渐成为全社的风气。春耕播种时，社里缺二十多头牲口，社员就自动以人力代替畜力拉车、拉犁；社里使用的大篓、土筐、粪筐，都是一钱没花，由社员自己利用生产空隙，到山上采集荆条编成的；社员还自己修理农具，把农具修理费全部节省了下来。全社节省的钱不下几万元，从而降低了生产成本。
    这个社秋收分配的结果，每个劳动日分了粮食十六斤，现金八角；每人分了棉花一斤，花生二十二斤。每户平均收入五百三十六元九角，每人平均收入一百一十元四角。全社除两户人口多劳力少的社员比1955年少收入六、七元以外，其余五百四十七户社员都增加了收入。按照“三定”产量，这个社本来需要国家供应粮食十九万斤；现在却有余粮十五万斤卖给国家。社里已有92％的社员成了余粮户，缺口粮的三十四户，也由社里调剂解决了。社员的生活普遍上升到中农水平。吃的是半稀半干，穿的是冬有棉衣，秋有夹衣，夏有单衣。住房也有很大改善，一年来新建和翻修了二百多间房子，还有二百多间正在修建和准备修建。
    现在，社里已经规划了1957年的生产。计划粮食亩产量达到四百七十三斤，棉花二百斤，花生三百斤。林业、牧业和副业生产，也都较1956年有所发展。
    这个社有五百四十九户。解放以前，这里的人们生活极苦，有二十多户农民常年靠要饭生活。土地改革以后，小农经济也经不起自然灾害，在灾害面前，跌倒了就爬不起来。政府每年救济十八万斤粮食和四百件衣服，但是不少人还是过着少吃没穿的生活。到了1952年秋季，开始建立了合作社，生产才有了提高。但是，只有在1955年转为高级社以后，才有了彻底摆脱贫困状况的希望。现在，这里的人们都欢欣鼓舞，喜笑颜开，一致反映：“合作社好得很”，“合作社救了命”，“要不是合作社，我连炕也没有了”。
