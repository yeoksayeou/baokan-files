    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 22nd: S.A. Dange, member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of India and General Secretary of the All India Trade Union Congress, has been elected as a member of the People's Assembly in Bombay. He received 323,526 votes, setting a record for the highest number of votes in this Indian election. His opponent, G.D. Ambekar, leader of the Indian National Trade Union Congress led by the Indian National Congress, received 187,241 votes.
    Out of the five hundred seats in the People's Assembly, the results for three hundred and seventy-six seats have been announced, with the Congress Party holding an absolute majority, securing a total of two hundred and eighty-three seats. The Communist Party of India secured twenty-two seats. The Praja Socialist Party secured fourteen seats. The remaining seats were won by other parties and independent candidates.
    The Congress Party has now secured an absolute majority in the legislative assemblies of eleven Indian states—including Bihar, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, and Madras.
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi: The Communist Party of India has secured an absolute majority of seats in the Kerala State Legislative Assembly. Out of the one hundred and twenty-six seats, they have won a total of fifty-nine, exceeding half when including the seats won by five other candidates supported by the Communist Party of India.
    In the election in this state, the Congress Party won forty-two seats, the Praja Socialist Party nine seats, the Muslim League eight seats, and independent candidates six seats. Currently, the results of only two seats remain unannounced.
    As the Communist Party of India has become the largest party in the Kerala State Assembly, it will be invited by the governor to form a state government, according to the Indian Constitution.
    Kerala is located in southwestern India. Its area totals 15,035 square miles, making it the smallest of India's fourteen states. Its population totals 13,560,000, making it the state with the highest population density. The state's economy mainly relies on coir fiber, cashew nuts, rubber, tea, and coffee plantations, in which British capital holds a dominant position. In this state, approximately 50% of residents depend on land for their livelihood, and there is high unemployment in both urban and rural areas, but the literacy rate is the highest among all Indian states (approximately 60%-70%).
    The Politburo of the Communist Party of India will hold a meeting in Ernakulam, Kerala, on March 22nd to discuss the current situation and the issue of forming a state government in the future. CPI Central Committee members Gopalan and Nair believe that the Communist Party of India will form a government in this state and will seek the support of the Praja Socialist Party to ensure a stable government for the people.
    CPI General Secretary Ajoy Ghosh wrote in a recent editorial in "New Age" that the results of the Kerala election are "a new milestone for the Communist Party of India" and are "events of profound significance for free India's march towards socialism."

　　国大党在人民院得票继续领先
　  印共在喀拉拉邦获得过半数议席
    印共政治局将讨论组织邦政府
    据新华社新德里22日电　印度共产党政治局委员、全印工会大会总书记斯·阿·丹吉已在孟买当选为人民院议员。他获得了三十二万三千五百二十六票，创造了印度这次选举中得票的最高纪录。他的对手、印度国大党领导的印度全国工会大会的领袖格·德·安贝卡获得了十八万七千二百四十一票。
    在人民院的五百个议员中已经宣布了三百七十六个席位的结果，其中国大党占绝对多数，共得二百八十三席。印度共产党得二十二席。人民社会党获得十四席。其余的席位由其它党派和独立人士获得。
    国大党现已在印度的十一个邦立法会议中——包括比哈尔、西孟加拉、安得拉和马德拉斯——获得绝对多数席位。
    据新华社新德里电　印度共产党在喀拉拉邦立法会议中已经获得绝对多数的席位。在一百二十六个席位中，他们一共得到了五十九个，加上另外五个受到印度共产党支持的候选人所获得的席位在内，超过了半数。
    在这个邦的选举中，国大党获得四十二席，人民社会党九席，穆斯林联盟八席，独立人士六席。现在，只剩下两个席位的结果尚未揭晓。
    由于印度共产党在喀拉拉邦议会中已成为最大政党，根据印度宪法，它将得到邦长的邀请组织邦政府。
    喀拉拉邦在印度西南部。它的面积共一万五千零三十五英里，是印度十四个邦中最小的一个邦；人口共一千三百五十六万多人，是各邦中人口密度最高的。这个邦的经济主要是椰子皮纤维、漆树果、橡胶、茶和咖啡种植园，其中英国资本占统治地位。在这个邦，约有50％的居民依靠土地为生，城市和乡村中的失业人数很多，但是识字的人数比例在印度各邦中是最高的（约占60％—70％）。
    印度共产党政治局将于3月22日在喀拉拉邦的埃纳库拉姆举行会议，讨论当前形势和今后组织邦政府的问题。印度共产党中央委员会委员高普兰和奈尔认为，印度共产党将在这个邦组织政府，并且将设法取得人民社会党的支持，以便使人民得到稳定的政府。
    印度共产党总书记高士在最近一期“新世纪”的社论中写道，喀拉拉选举的结果是“印度共产党的一个新的里程碑”，并且是“对于自由印度向社会主义前进具有深刻意义的事件。”
