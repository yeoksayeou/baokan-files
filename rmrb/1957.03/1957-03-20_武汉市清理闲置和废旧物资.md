Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 19th: Factories, government offices, schools, and organizations in Wuhan are currently cleaning up warehouses, workshops, and storage rooms, while the general public is also collecting all kinds of waste materials to support socialist construction. The relevant departments in Wuhan established a special warehouse clearance, waste collection, and salvage committee in late February to lead this work in a unified manner. From the second half of February to the present, more than 350 tons of various steel materials have been collected from salvage and waste material purchases alone.

Many units have established special warehouse clearance committees or groups, and many responsible cadres have personally participated in the cleanup work. Many employees of the jointly owned Yuhua, Zhenhuan and other yarn factories have used their spare time to clean up and collect waste materials. In just a few days, the two factories have cleaned up more than 20 tons of broken steel plates, scrap iron, scrapped machines, and various parts that have been neglected for a long time. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee cleared out more than 530 surplus desks, chairs, and beds in total; the paper cleared out by the Municipal People's Committee can be used for four or five months, and the envelopes cleared out can be used for ten months.

At present, many salvage workers are still salvaging materials in the Yangtze River. According to preliminary investigation, there are more than 2,000 tons of various types of steel sunk in the river. The relevant departments are preparing to increase manpower threefold to salvage these things.

Each district in Wuhan has already formed the existing 1,100-plus small vendors who purchase waste materials into six agency stores and more than 100 mobile purchasing groups to conduct purchases in the neighborhoods. Each district has also conducted extensive publicity among residents. After understanding the principle of selling waste materials to support construction, residents have actively cleaned up and concentrated various waste materials at home. The waste metal received by the purchasing department in February increased more than fourfold compared to January.

    武汉市清理闲置和废旧物资
    新华社武汉19日电　武汉市各工厂、机关、学校和团体正在清理仓库、车间和储藏室，广大市民也把所有的废品搜集起来，支援社会主义建设。武汉市有关部门在2月下旬专门成立了一个清仓收废打捞委员会，统一领导这一工作。从2月下半月到目前为止，仅从打捞和收购废品中收集到的各种钢材共有三百五十多吨。
    不少单位专门成立了清仓委员会或小组，许多负责干部亲自参加清理工作。公私合营裕华、震寰等纱厂很多职工利用业余时间清理和搜集废品，几天中两厂已清理出长期无人过问的破钢板、废铁、报废的机器和各种零件共二十多吨。中共武汉市委、市人民委员会两个机关共清出五百三十多件多余的办公桌、椅子和床铺；市人民委员会清出的纸张可用四、五个月，清出的信封可用十个月。
    目前还有许多打捞工人正在长江打捞物资。据初步查明，沉没在江内的各种钢铁有两千多吨，有关部门准备再增加两倍的人力来打捞这些东西。
    武汉市各区已经把现有的一千一百多个收购废品的小商贩组成六个代营店和一百多个流动收购组，深入里弄进行收购。各区还对居民进行了广泛的宣传，居民懂得了出卖废品支援建设的道理以后，都积极把家里各种废品清理集中起来。2月份收购部门收到的废金属比1月份增加四倍多。
