The CCP Central Committee and State Council
Directive on the Issue of Draught Animals
(March 19, 1957)

First, draught animals should be comprehensively arranged according to the need for animal power. --Sufficient fodder is the material foundation for raising good draught animals. --Improve the work of using, feeding, and managing draught animals. --Plan to breed and improve draught animals. --Strengthen the work of preventing and controlling animal diseases. --Do a good job in the transportation and regulation of draught animals. --Appropriately adjust the purchase prices of slaughter cattle and cowhide. --Reasonably eliminate old and disabled draught animals. --Local party and government leading organs are required to formulate specific plans to protect and develop draught animals in accordance with local conditions, and help agricultural cooperatives solve specific problems, so as to ensure further development of agricultural production.

According to statistics from the State Statistical Bureau, the total number of large livestock in the country increased from 59.77 million in 1949 to 87.56 million in 1956, an increase of 27.79 million, exceeding the highest pre-war year (1935) of 71.5 million by 22.5%. During the recovery period before 1952, the average annual increase was 8.5%, a rapid rate. In the two years of 1953 and 1954, the average annual increase was 5.6%, and the growth rate slowed down. From June 1954 to June 1956, large livestock increased by only 2.58 million, an increase of 3% in two years, especially in the latter year, with an increase of only 180,000. If we further analyze and exclude the number of livestock increased in pastoral areas, the number of draught animals in agricultural areas has decreased in some provinces. The southern provinces have increased and decreased, with most provinces increasing and a few slightly decreasing. The most prominent decrease in draught animals is in the three northeastern provinces and the four provinces north of the Huai River: Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and Shaanxi. In the two years from June 1954 to June 1956, large livestock decreased by a total of 1.9 million. This situation of decreasing draught animals has begun to improve in most places since the second half of 1956, but has not completely stopped in a few places.

Why has the situation of decreasing draught animals occurred? The reasons are very complex, and there are differences between the south and the north. First of all, from the perspective of several provinces in the Northeast and North China, the shortage of feed and fodder is the direct cause of the decrease in draught animals. In agricultural production cooperatives, the labor borne by draught animals has greatly increased, but the feed standard has not only not increased correspondingly, but some have even been lowered than in the past, and fodder is also insufficient. In addition, after livestock are raised in a concentrated manner, there is insufficient experience in feeding management, and they are not fed well, resulting in the weakness and death of draught animals. Secondly, in the past few years, in the land reform and agricultural cooperativization movements, in order to prevent damage to draught animals, the ban on slaughter has been consistently emphasized, and the slaughter standards for draught animals have been too strict. This did play a role in protecting draught animals at that time, but it also brought about a bad result—the proportion of old, disabled draught animals and small, unsuitable draught animals in the existing draught animals is too large, which is more harmful than beneficial to farmers. Under the conditions of fodder shortage, this batch of old, disabled draught animals and small, unsuitable draught animals are more likely to be sold or slaughtered. Thirdly, agricultural production cooperatives, due to the concentration of land and large scale of production, are willing to have strong and robust draught animals. The supply of such draught animals cannot meet demand, and the prices are very high. They are unwilling to have old, disabled draught animals and small, weak draught animals (small cattle, small donkeys), because these draught animals do little work and eat a lot of fodder. The more fodder is lacking, the more these draught animals are squeezed out, the lower the prices, and the more they are sold and slaughtered. Fourthly, the work of breeding draught animals has not been grasped tightly. Draught animals are heavily burdened with labor, and do not eat well. The breeding ability of breeding bulls is poor, the estrus of cows is abnormal, the conception rate is reduced, miscarriages are increased, and the breeding rate is decreased. Fifthly, the draught animal market has largely stagnated, and normal circulation is intermittent, resulting in imbalances between production and sales. As a result, some provinces that have historically relied on importing draught animals from other places cannot get normal supplements, and the number of draught animals has decreased. Finally, some agricultural production cooperatives have unreasonable valuations of draught animals that join the cooperatives, which has caused a decline in the price of draught animals. In the winter of 1955, in order to stop the indiscriminate slaughter of draught animals, the purchase prices of slaughter cattle and cowhide were also lowered, and farmers had no profit in raising livestock, which greatly affected farmers' enthusiasm for breeding livestock.

This serious and unfavorable situation in the development of draught animals must be taken seriously and quickly overcome by leading party and government organs at all levels, otherwise it will bring serious consequences to the development of agricultural production, and thus also have an adverse impact on the development of the entire national economy. To this end, the following instructions are given:

(1) First, draught animals should be comprehensively arranged according to the need for animal power. Each agricultural production cooperative should reasonably arrange all the draught animals and working animals in the entire cooperative according to the amount of cultivated land in the entire cooperative, the need for animal power in agricultural and sideline production, and the need for animal power in the sideline production and daily life of cooperative members' families. It is understandable that agricultural production cooperatives, with concentrated land management, prefer to have strong and robust draught animals. However, the number of large, strong draught animals is insufficient. In this case, small and weak livestock should be used to supplement the deficiency and bear some light labor. Small working animals that cannot be used within the cooperative can also be transferred to cooperative members for private ownership, private raising, and private use, or shared by several cooperative members for shared ownership, shared raising, and shared use, to meet the needs of cooperative members' family sideline production and daily life for animal power. If there is still a surplus, it is allowed to sell and eliminate them. Young livestock must be well fed and raised. Weak draught animals must also be strengthened in feeding management to restore their physical strength. In the case of insufficient large working animals that are strong and robust, if small working animals that are small and weak are blindly rejected, it will inevitably lead to a serious shortage of animal power. This approach is clearly wrong.

A small number of agricultural production cooperatives have unreasonable valuations of draught animals that join the cooperatives, and the payments have not been repaid on time. This is also detrimental to the development of draught animals. The CCP Central Committee and the State Council have repeatedly pointed out this problem, but there are still many cooperatives with this situation, which must be effectively resolved in accordance with the model charter of agricultural production cooperatives.

(2) Sufficient fodder is the material foundation for raising livestock well. When agricultural production cooperatives formulate planting plans for various crops, they should calculate the total needs of fodder based on the existing and planned number and types of livestock of the cooperative and cooperative members' families, and uniformly arrange the production and supply of fodder. Areas lacking fodder should first try to make full use of crop straws, promote silage methods, expand fodder sources, and make full use of fieldsides, ridges, and abandoned land to increase fodder production. If it still cannot meet the needs, they should appropriately increase the planting of crops whose straws can be used as fodder, and delineate certain land as a fodder base to plant high-yielding fodder crops. Areas with wasteland should be encouraged to reclaim and plant fodder, provided that soil and water conservation is not damaged. Mountainous areas should implement the policy of combining agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, and overcome the blind and mechanical bias in afforestation work, leaving a certain amount of grassland for livestock. Fodder and roughage can only be solved locally by agricultural production cooperatives themselves.

In the work of unified purchase and sale of grain, the necessary refined feed for livestock must be uniformly arranged. In some areas, the standard of feed retention is too low and should be appropriately increased. Pregnant animals, breeding animals, and improved breeds of livestock should retain more refined feed than general livestock. Young livestock should retain feed according to the standards for adult livestock. Grain processing should be appropriately decentralized so that by-products can be supplied to rural areas nearby to raise livestock. Certain economic crop areas where refined feed cannot really be self-sufficient should be given the necessary and appropriate adjustments by the state in the unified purchase and sale of grain.

(3) Improve the work of using, feeding, and managing draught animals. In the use of draught animals, it is necessary to unify the two requirements of increasing agricultural production and protecting livestock. Different labor quotas should be set according to the different physical strengths of livestock, appropriately limiting the service time and labor intensity, so that draught animals can have appropriate rest and recover from fatigue. At the same time, the labor points of users cannot be reduced because the weak draught animals do less work, in order to prevent cooperative members from competing for strong livestock and excluding weak livestock and small working animals. In terms of feeding management, dedicated personnel should be assigned to feed them, and active elements with livestock raising experience should be selected as feeders to improve the treatment of feeders so that they can work with peace of mind. It is also necessary to strengthen the education of love and protection of livestock among all cooperative members, formulate a system of rewards and punishments for feeding and service, and improve the sense of responsibility and enthusiasm of users and feeders to protect draught animals. A system of handover between feeding and using personnel should be established to combine the responsibilities of feeding and service of draught animals so as to protect draught animals more effectively. Some cooperatives have adopted the method of dedicated personnel in charge, combining use and feeding, which can be studied and tried. Some cooperatives hand over the draught animals to the production team, and the team assigns them to the cooperative members who raise draught animals at a price based on the current physical condition of the draught animals. The cooperative member is responsible for raising them well or poorly, and the cooperative calculates a certain rent for the amount of plowing. This is also a method that can be tried if the cooperative members agree. In short, cooperatives can be allowed to have a certain degree of autonomy in this regard to adopt appropriate and flexible measures based on the specific conditions of the cooperative, in order to facilitate the enthusiasm of cooperative members in raising draught animals. It is not appropriate to make the methods too rigid in a uniform manner.

(4) Plan to breed and improve draught animals. General plain agricultural areas, especially areas lacking draught animals, should change the past habit of relying solely on purchasing draught animals from other places, and actively promote local breeding of draught animals. Each agricultural production cooperative should formulate a plan for breeding draught animals in the cooperative based on the needs and possibilities of the cooperative, and cannot simply rely on purchasing from other places. The breeding work this spring must be done actively. In areas where conditions permit, cooperative members should also be encouraged to raise and breed large livestock as family sideline production; cooperative members have the right to freely dispose of the raised livestock, and the cooperative has no right to interfere. Grassland areas, mountainous areas, and hilly areas have favorable conditions for breeding draught animals, and also have this habit and experience. They should actively breed and cultivate draught animals to support areas lacking draught animals.

In order to continuously improve the quality of draught animals and meet the needs of agricultural cooperatives for large draught animals, it is necessary to strengthen the work of improving breeds and strengthen the work of improving small cattle and donkeys with small size and strength. Areas producing small cattle and donkeys should systematically introduce excellent breeding bulls, castrate local inferior breeding bulls, overcome the phenomenon of wild mating, and gradually improve the quality of draught animals. Crossbreeding of male donkeys and mares and male horses and female donkeys can also be used to breed mules and hinnies. Areas producing improved breeds of draught animals should strive to breed a large number of them to support the needs of various places for breeding bulls.

Agricultural production cooperatives should establish a reward system for breeding and breeding draught animals to encourage the enthusiasm of production teams (groups) and breeding personnel in breeding livestock. For private livestock households that have joined the cooperatives, they should be encouraged to continue to carry out livestock breeding work, improve their social status, and ensure their due income.

(5) Strengthen the work of preventing and controlling animal diseases. After agricultural cooperativization, the feeding and use of draught animals have become more concentrated. At the same time, the transportation of livestock and livestock products has become more frequent, and livestock diseases are more likely to spread. Therefore, in addition to strengthening the quarantine work of livestock, agricultural production cooperatives should also be guided to establish and improve epidemic prevention systems, actively help agricultural production cooperatives train animal disease prevention and control personnel, and conscientiously give full play to the strength of folk veterinarians to carry out animal disease prevention and control work. For folk veterinarians who have joined the cooperatives, their labor remuneration issues must be resolved reasonably to give full play to their enthusiasm. Strengthen the production and supply of veterinary medicines and equipment to ensure the material needs for preventing and controlling animal diseases. Strengthen scientific research work to further grasp the laws of livestock epidemic prevalence so that animal disease prevention and control work can achieve better results.

(6) Do a good job in the transportation and regulation of draught animals. In the past, the circulation pattern of draught animals was generally that they first flowed from mountainous and pastoral areas to hilly areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, and after two or three years of use, the livestock also became accustomed to agricultural cultivation, and then flowed into plain agricultural areas. This circulation pattern is conducive to the breeding of livestock in mountainous areas and to the supplementation of draught animals in plain agricultural areas, which is reasonable and normal. However, in recent years, this normal and reasonable circulation relationship has been interrupted in some places, affecting the regulation of surplus and shortage of draught animals. This situation should be changed quickly. The work of transporting and regulating draught animals should be actively carried out. The current regional blockade methods in some places should be abolished. Livestock dealers should be allowed to transport freely. The draught animal trading market under the leadership of the state should be actively restored and further activated. Reasonable regional price differences should be gradually stipulated to stimulate the exchange of livestock between regions. In areas with insufficient draught animals, supply and marketing cooperative departments should actively organize and assist agricultural production cooperatives to purchase draught animals in producing areas, and organize experienced livestock dealers to transport livestock to producing areas. On the routes of livestock circulation, commercial and supply and marketing cooperative departments should systematically set up cattle and mule and horse shops along the way to help solve the needs of livestock fodder and feed and livestock dealers' food and lodging during transportation, so that livestock can flow smoothly and the surplus and shortage of draught animals can be regulated.

(7) Appropriately adjust the purchase prices of slaughter cattle and cowhide. It is actually difficult to clearly distinguish between slaughter cattle and draught cattle. Some of the cattle produced in pastoral areas and mountains are sold directly as slaughter cattle, and some are sold to agricultural areas as draught cattle. After a few years of use, they become old and disabled draught cattle and are treated as slaughter cattle again. Therefore, the level of slaughter cattle and cowhide prices has always changed with the supply and demand of draught cattle and the level of prices, and it is also closely related to farmers' enthusiasm for breeding draught cattle. During the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization in the winter of 1955, in order to protect draught cattle and prevent indiscriminate slaughter, the purchase prices of slaughter cattle and cowhide were consciously reduced, which was necessary at that time. Now, the situation has changed. Draught cattle prices have gradually recovered, and draught cattle have joined the cooperatives and have been transferred to the collective ownership of agricultural production cooperatives. As long as, as mentioned above, agricultural production cooperatives are seriously assisted in making comprehensive and reasonable arrangements for draught animals and solving the problem of fodder and feed, the increase in the purchase prices of slaughter cattle and cowhide will generally not cause a large number of draught cattle to be sold and slaughtered indiscriminately. On the contrary, increasing the purchase prices of slaughter cattle and cowhide and changing the current situation that farmers have no profit or even lose money in raising cattle can stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for raising cattle, which is conducive to the development of draught animals. Therefore, the purchase prices of slaughter cattle and cowhide should be appropriately increased so that farmers can obtain reasonable profits from raising cattle. As for the amount of the increase in the purchase price, as well as the issue of appropriately increasing the sales price, the relevant business departments under the State Council should cooperate with local governments to study and discuss and put forward a plan, which will be submitted to the State Council for approval and issued separately.

(8) Reasonably eliminate old and disabled draught animals. At present, the proportion of old and disabled draught animals is too large in some places. These old and disabled draught animals are already unable to be used for service, wasting feed and labor, and have become an extra burden for agricultural production cooperatives. Therefore, the practice of excessively strict bans on slaughter should be changed in a timely manner, and the standards for elimination should be relaxed so that old and disabled draught animals can be reasonably eliminated. However, on the other hand, due to the current shortage of meat, after the purchase prices of slaughter cattle and cowhide are increased, it may also cause indiscriminate slaughter of draught animals that are not of very good quality but can still be used in some places, which must also be effectively prevented. Especially in areas with insufficient draught animals, the proportion of old and disabled draught animals should be clarified, and appropriate control should be exercised during elimination to prevent indiscriminate slaughter. Provinces should formulate elimination standards for old and disabled draught animals based on local customs and the surplus and shortage of draught animals in different regions. The district or township people's government, absorbing representatives from relevant business departments, agricultural production cooperatives, and experienced livestock dealers, should jointly form an inspection team, inspect them in accordance with the local elimination standards, using simple and easy-to-implement methods, and those that meet the standards can be approved for elimination. Draught animals that have been approved for elimination shall be uniformly purchased and slaughtered by food companies to supply the market; if food companies do not purchase them, farmers are allowed to dispose of them freely.

(9) Since liberation, my country's draught animals have made considerable progress, but they still cannot meet the needs of agricultural production development. Especially after agricultural cooperativization, due to the increase in the multiple cropping index, the increase in the sown area, and the use of new agricultural tools, more and better draught animals are needed. At the same time, it must be understood that under China's specific conditions, agricultural mechanization cannot be achieved in a short period of time. In a considerable period of time in the future, draught animals will still be the main driving force of agricultural production. Even after the realization of agricultural mechanization, draught animals are still an important auxiliary driving force of agricultural production. Therefore, not only must various active measures be taken for draught animals to breed them, but also the phenomena of weakness and abnormal death must be overcome in a timely and effective manner. It must never be allowed to continue to develop, otherwise, it will not only seriously affect the bumper harvest of agriculture in 1957, but also cause the difficulty of long-term insufficient power for agricultural production in the next few years. Therefore, local party and government leading organs are required to immediately convene relevant departments such as agriculture, supply and marketing, commerce, and grain after receiving this instruction, conduct in-depth research on the work of draught animals, formulate specific plans to protect and develop draught animals in accordance with local conditions, and effectively help agricultural production cooperatives solve various practical difficulties and specific problems existing in the current development of draught animals, so that draught animals can get the due development, so as to ensure the animal power required for agricultural production development, and enable agricultural production to obtain further development.

　　中共中央　国务院
　　关于耕畜问题的指示
　　（一九五七年三月十九日）
　　首先要根据对畜力的需要，来全面安排耕畜。——充足的饲草饲料，是养好耕畜的物质基础。——改善耕畜的役使和饲养管理工作。——有计划地繁殖和改良耕畜。——加强兽疫防治工作。——作好耕畜的贩运调剂工作。——适当调整菜牛和牛皮的收购价格。——合理地淘汰老残耕畜。——要求各地党政领导机关制定适合当地情况的保护和发展耕畜的具体方案，帮助农业社解决具体问题，从而保证农业生产获得进一步的发展。
    根据国家统计局的统计，全国大家畜的总头数由1949年的五九七七万头，增加到1956年的八七五六万头，增加了二七七九万头，比战前最高年份（1935年）的七一五○万头超过22.5％。在1952年以前的恢复时期中，平均每年递增8.5％，增加的速度是很快的。1953年和1954年两个年度，平均每年递增5.6％，增长的速度降低了。从1954年6月到1956年6月这两个年度，大家畜只增加二五八万头，两年增加3％，特别是其中的后一个年度只增加一八万头。如果再进一步加以分析，把牧业区增殖的头数除外，农业区耕畜的头数在若干省份则是下降的。南方各省有增有减，多数省份是增加的，少数省份略有减少。耕畜减少最突出的是东北三省和淮河以北的山东、河南、河北、陕西四省，在1954年6月到1956年6月的两年之内，大家畜共减少一九○万头。这种耕畜减少的情况，从1956年下半年起，多数地方已经开始好转，少数地方还没有完全停止。
    为什么会发生耕畜减少的情况呢？原因是很复杂的，南方、北方也有所不同。首先，从东北、华北的几个省看，饲料不足和饲草困难，是耕畜减少的直接原因。在农业生产合作社里，耕畜所负担的劳役是大大增加了，而饲料标准不仅没有相应的增加，有的反而比过去降低了，饲草也感不足，再加以牲口集中喂养以后，饲养管理的经验不够，喂得不好，因而造成耕畜的瘦弱死亡。其次，几年以来，在土地改革和农业合作化运动中，为了防止破坏耕畜，一贯强调禁宰，耕畜的宰杀标准过严，这在当时确实起了保护耕畜的作用，但是，也带来一种不好的结果——应该淘汰的老残耕畜和体型小、不适用的耕畜在现有耕畜中所占的比例过大，对农民害大利小。在草料困难的条件下，这批老残耕畜和体型小、不适用的耕畜就更多地被出卖，被宰杀了。再次，农业生产合作社由于土地集中，生产规模大，都愿意要体强力壮的耕畜，这种耕畜供不应求，价格很高，都不愿意要老残耕畜和体型小、力气小的耕畜（小牛、小驴），因为这种耕畜做活不多，草料不少吃，草料越缺，这种耕畜越受排挤，价格越跌，出卖宰杀的也越多。再次，对于耕畜的繁殖工作也抓得不紧，耕畜的劳役重，吃的又不好，种公畜配种能力差，母畜发情不正常，受胎率降低，流产增加，繁殖率下降。再次，耕畜市场大部停顿，正常流转若断若续，产销失调；于是，某些历来依靠从外地输入耕畜的省区，得不到正常的补充，耕畜数量就下降了。最后，有些农业生产合作社对于入社的耕畜作价不合理，曾经引起耕畜价格下跌，1955年冬季，为了制止滥宰耕畜，又压低了菜牛和牛皮的收购价格，农民养畜无利，这也大大影响农民繁殖牲畜的积极性。
    耕畜发展方面的这种严重不利的情况，必须引起各级党政领导机关的重视，迅速加以克服，否则将给农业生产的发展带来严重的后果，从而也将给整个国民经济的发展带来不利的影响。为此，特作如下的指示：
      （一）首先要根据畜力的需要，来全面安排耕畜。每个农业生产合作社都应该根据全社耕地的多少，农业和副业生产中畜力的需要，以及社员家庭副业和日常生活中畜力的需要，来合理地安排全社所有的耕畜和役畜。农业生产合作社，土地集中经营，喜欢要体强力壮的耕畜，这是可以理解的。但是，体强力壮的大型耕畜数量是不够的，在这种情况下，就应该用体格小力气小的牲畜来补不足，负担一些轻便的劳役。社内用不完的小型役畜，还可以转给社员私有、私养、私用，或几户社员伙有、伙养、伙用，满足社员家庭副业生产和日常生活中对于畜力的需要。如果还有多余，则允许出卖和淘汰。幼畜必须好好饲育。瘦弱的耕畜，也必须加强饲养管理，恢复体力。在体强力壮的大型役畜不足的情况下，如果又盲目地排斥体格小力气小的小型役畜，则势必引起畜力严重不足的现象，这种做法显然是不对的。
    有少数农业生产合作社，对于入社的耕畜，作价不够合理，价款也没有按期偿还。这对于发展耕畜也是不利的。中共中央和国务院曾经再三指出这个问题，但是，至今还有不少社存在着这种情况，必须按照农业生产合作社示范章程切实加以解决。
      （二）充足的饲草饲料，是养好牲畜的物质基础。农业生产合作社制定各种农作物的播种计划的时候，应该根据社和社员家庭现有的和计划发展的牲畜数量和种类，算出饲草和饲料的全部需要量，来统一安排饲草和饲料的生产和供应。饲草和饲料缺乏的地区，首先应该尽量利用作物秸秆，推行青贮方法，扩大饲草来源，充分利用田边地埂和废弃土地增产饲草饲料；如果仍然不能满足需要，就应该适当地增种秸秆可作饲草的作物，并且划出一定的土地做为饲料基地，种植高产饲料作物。有荒地的地区，在不破坏水土保持的前提下，应该提倡开垦种植饲料。山区应该贯彻执行农、林、牧相结合的方针，克服封山育林工作中的盲目机械化的偏向，给牲畜留出一定的草山。饲草和粗饲料，只能由农业生产合作社自己就地解决。
    在粮食统购统销工作中，必须统一安排牲畜所必要的精料。有些地区留料标准偏低，应该适当提高。孕畜、种畜和良种的牲畜，应该比一般牲畜多留精料。幼畜应该按成年牲畜标准留料。粮食加工应该适当分散，使副产品能就近供应农村，饲养牲畜。精料确实不能自给的某些经济作物区，国家在粮食统购统销中应该给以必要的适当的调剂。
      （三）改善耕畜的役使和饲养管理工作。在使用耕畜方面，必须把农业增产和保畜这两项要求统一起来，要根据牲畜体力强弱的不同，规定不同的劳动定额，适当地限制役使时间和劳动强度，使耕畜能够有适当的休息，恢复疲劳；同时，不能因为使用体力弱的耕畜，做的活少，而降低使用者的劳动工分，以防止社员争用强的牲畜、排斥弱畜和小型役畜的现象。在饲养管理方面，应该指定专人饲养，挑选有养畜经验的积极分子作饲养员，改善饲养员的待遇，使他们安心工作。还必须在全体社员中加强爱畜保畜的教育，制定饲养和役使的奖惩制度，提高使用和饲养人员保护耕畜的责任心和积极性。规定饲养、使用人员的交接制度，把耕畜的饲养和役使两方面的责任制结合起来，以便更有效地保护耕畜。有的合作社所采取的专人负责、使用和饲养合一的办法，可以研究试行。有的合作社将耕畜交给生产队，由队按现在耕畜的体质，论价交给饲养耕畜的社员，养好养坏由他自己负责，犁地多少则由社算给一定的租金，这在社员们同意时，也是可以试行的一种办法。总之，可以容许各合作社在这方面有根据本社具体情况、采取适当的灵活措施的一定自治权，以利发挥社员饲养耕畜的积极性，不宜千篇一律地把办法规定得太死。
      （四）有计划地繁殖和改良耕畜。一般平原农业区，特别是耕畜缺乏的地区，应该改变过去单纯依靠从外地购入耕畜的习惯，积极提倡就地繁殖耕畜。每一个农业生产合作社，都应该根据本社的需要和可能，定出本社繁殖耕畜的计划，不能单纯依靠从外地采购。今年春季的配种工作，必须积极做好。在有条件的地区，还应该提倡社员自养和繁殖大家畜，做为家庭副业生产；育成的牲口，社员有权自由支配，合作社无权干涉。草原区、山区和丘陵区，有繁殖耕畜的有利条件，也有这种习惯和经验，更应该积极繁殖和培育耕畜，来支援缺乏耕畜的地区。
    为了不断地提高耕畜质量，满足农业社对于大型耕畜的需要，必须加强畜种的改良工作，加强对于体格小、力气小的小型牛、驴的改良工作。小型牛、驴的产区，应该有计划地引进优良种公畜，?割本地的劣种公畜，克服野交乱配现象，逐渐提高耕畜质量。也可以选用公驴和母马及公马和母驴杂交，繁殖骡和驴骡。良种耕畜产区，更应该努力大量繁殖，支援各地种用公畜的需要。
    农业生产合作社应该建立配种繁殖耕畜的奖励制度，鼓励生产队（组）和配种人员繁殖牲畜的积极性。对于入社的民桩户，应该鼓励他们继续进行牲畜配种工作，并且提高他们的社会地位，保障他们应得的收益。
      （五）加强兽疫防治工作。农业合作化以后，耕畜的饲养和使用比较集中了，同时，牲畜和畜产品的调运日益频繁，牲畜的疫病也更加容易传播。因此，除了加强牲畜的检疫工作以外，还应该指导农业生产合作社建立和健全防疫制度，积极帮助农业生产合作社训练兽疫的防治人员，认真地把民间兽医力量发挥起来，进行兽疫防治工作。对于已经入社的民间兽医，必须合理地解决他们的劳动报酬问题，发挥他们的积极性。加强兽医药械的生产和供应工作，保证防治兽疫的物质需要。加强科学研究工作，进一步掌握牲畜疫病流行的规律，从而使兽疫防治工作收到更好的效果。
      （六）作好耕畜的贩运调剂工作。耕畜的流转规律，过去一般是由山区和牧区第一步流入丘陵区和半农半牧区，使用二、三年，牲口也习惯于农业耕作了，然后再流入平原农业区。这种流转规律，既利于山区牲畜的繁殖，也利于平原农业区耕畜的补充，是合理的，正常的。但是，近几年来，这种正常合理的流转关系，在这一些地方中断了，影响了耕畜的余缺调剂。应该迅速改变这种局面，积极开展耕畜的贩运调剂工作，取消某些地方现行的地区封锁的办法，允许畜贩自由贩运，积极恢复并且进一步活跃国家领导下的耕畜交易市场，逐步规定合理的地区差价，刺激地区间的牲畜交流。在耕畜不足的地区，供销合作部门应该积极组织和协助农业生产合作社到产区购买耕畜，组织有经验的畜贩，到产区贩运牲口。在牲畜流转的路线上，商业和供销合作部门，应该有计划地沿途设立牛行和骡马大店，帮助解决贩运途中牲口饲草饲料的需要和畜贩的食宿问题，使牲畜畅流起来，耕畜的余缺得到调剂。
      （七）适当调整菜牛和牛皮的收购价格。菜牛和耕牛实际上是很难截然划分的。牧区和山地所产的牛，一部分直接作为菜牛卖出，一部分卖给农业区作为耕牛，使用几年以后，成了老残的耕牛，又当作菜牛处理。因此，菜牛和牛皮价格的高低，历来就是随着耕牛的供求情况和价格高低的变化而变化的，对于农民繁殖耕牛的积极性关系也很大。在1955年冬季的农业合作化高潮中，为了保护耕牛，防止滥宰，曾经有意识地降低了菜牛和牛皮的收购价格，这在当时是必要的。现在，情况已经改变了，耕牛价格已经逐步回升，而且耕牛已经入社，已经转为农业生产合作社集体所有，只要像前面所说的，认真帮助农业生产合作社对耕畜进行全面合理的安排和解决饲草饲料问题，一般不致于因为菜牛和牛皮收购价格的提高，而引起大量出卖耕牛和滥宰耕牛。相反的，提高菜牛和牛皮的收购价格，改变目前农民养牛无利、甚至亏本的情况，反而可以刺激农民养牛的积极性，对于发展耕畜是有利的。因此，应该适当地提高菜牛和牛皮的收购价格，使农民养牛能够获得合理的利润。至于收购价格提高的幅度，以及适当提高销售价格问题，由国务院所属的有关业务部门协同地方研究商定，提出方案，报国务院批准，另行下达。
      （八）合理地淘汰老残耕畜。目前，有些地方，老残耕畜占的比例过大。这些老残耕畜，已经不堪役用，空耗饲料和人工，成为农业生产合作社的一种额外负担。因此，应该及时改变禁宰偏严的作法，放宽淘汰的标准，使老残耕畜得到合理的淘汰。但是，另一方面，由于目前肉食紧张，在菜牛和牛皮的收购价格提高以后，也可能在某些地方再度引起滥宰那些质量虽然不甚好但是仍能役用的耕畜，这也要切实注意防止。特别是在耕畜不足的地区，更应该摸清老残耕畜所占的比例，淘汰时加以适当控制，防止滥宰。各省应该分别不同的地区，根据当地的习惯和耕畜余缺的情况，制定老残耕畜的淘汰标准。由区或乡人民政府，吸收有关业务部门、农业生产合作社的代表和有经验的畜贩，共同组成检验小组，按照当地规定的淘汰标准，采用简便易行的办法，加以检验，合乎标准的，就可以批准淘汰。已经批准淘汰的耕畜，由食品公司统一收购、屠宰，供应市场；如果食品公司不收购，则允许农民自由处理。
      （九）解放以来，我国耕畜虽然有了不小的发展，但是，还不能满足农业生产发展的需要，特别是农业合作化以后，由于复种指数的提高，播种面积的增加和新式农具的采用，都需要更多更好的耕畜。同时，必须了解，在我国的具体条件下，农业机械化并不是短时期内所能实现的，在今后相当长的时期内，耕畜将仍然是农业生产的主要动力，即使实现农业机械化以后，耕畜仍然是农业生产的重要辅助动力。因此，对于耕畜不仅要采取各种积极措施，加以繁殖，而且必须对瘦弱和不正常死亡的现象，及时有效地加以克服，绝不能让它继续发展，否则，不仅会严重影响1957年的农业大丰收，而且会造成今后若干年内农业生产的动力长期不足的困难。因此，要求各地党政领导机关接到这一指示后，即时召集农业、供销、商业、粮食等有关部门，对耕畜工作进行深入的研究，制定适合当地情况的保护和发展耕畜的具体方案，切实帮助农业生产合作社解决当前耕畜发展中存在着的各种实际困难和具体问题，使耕畜得到应有的发展，从而保证农业生产发展所需要的畜力，使农业生产获得进一步的发展。
