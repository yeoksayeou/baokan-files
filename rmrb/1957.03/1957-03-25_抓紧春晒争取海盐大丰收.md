Liaodong Peninsula Sea Salt Spring Sunning Begins

Xinhua News Agency reporter Xu Jiazhu reports: The climate in the Liaodong Peninsula is gradually warming, and the season for spring sunning of sea salt has begun. Now, the salt workers at the Lushun Saltworks wake up early every morning, and when they see the clouds disappearing from the mountainside, they know that they are having a good day for sunning salt. They are busy repairing the salt pans and pouring concentrated brine into the square salt ponds. In order to have more time to sun salt during the day, the salt workers also turn on electric lights in the evening to repair the salt pans.

The Yingkou and Pixue salt fields in the northern part of Liaoning Province have also begun to fill the ponds and sun salt.

Liaoning Province is one of the six major sea salt areas in China, and a large part of the sea salt produced is used to supply the province's industrial production. This year, the staff of the Liaoning Salt Bureau discussed the plan and decided to increase the production of sea salt by more than 188,000 tons throughout the year.

Sunning Salt Busily on the Bohai Beach

Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Fangchen reports: Changlu Hangu Salt Affairs Bureau, a famous sea salt production area in China, has started spring sunning. On the Bohai beach, which stretches for more than 300 *li* from Hangu in the west to Yanghekou in the east, a moving scene of labor is presented: As soon as the sun rises from the sea, the sound of machines can be heard on the sea dyke. The workers working beside the water pumps use the tide to continuously suck the rolling sea water into the storage ponds and send it to each salt field. In the neat checkerboard-style salt ponds, groups of salt workers are either clarifying the ponds or compacting the *zhou*, rushing to complete the final process of sunning salt—removing the floating mud in the ponds and compacting the pond slabs. The large windmills scattered on the salt flats are constantly rotating with the gentle sea breeze, pouring the brine into the ponds.

The staff of various salt fields under the Changlu Hangu Salt Affairs Bureau have proposed to increase the production of sea salt by 72,800 tons throughout the year. As of March 20, 1,236 crystallization ponds in various salt fields have begun to sun salt.

Most Salt Fields in Shandong Begin Filling Ponds

Xinhua News Agency reporter Gao Wenxian reports: Most of the salt fields in Shandong Province have begun filling ponds for spring sunning. Shidao and Rizhao salt fields have already produced 22 tons of new salt.

The salt workers and salt farmers in various salt fields are highly motivated to complete the province's plan to increase sea salt production by 280,000 tons. The attendance rate of various units generally reaches 95% to 98%, and some reach 100%. Some salt farmers in Shidao and Jinkou salt fields have also changed their habit of not going to the beach in the morning. As soon as it dawns, they take dry food and go to the beach to work. Many salt farmers in Rizhao Salt Field have moved to the beach to live in order not to miss the working hours of the next day.

The First Day of Sunning at Huaibei Salt Field

Xinhua News Agency reporter Jiang Qingping reports: On the 20th, the workers of Huaibei Salt Field on the coast of the Yellow Sea started the tense spring sunning with joy.

On this day, the sun shone on the sea, sparkling and dazzling. Patches of white sails and flocks of seagulls on the sea made a harmonious embellishment to the blue sky. On the vast salt flats filled with sea water, the blue waves were rippling. Strings of water-lifting windmills facing the sea breeze turned constantly, sending sea water to various salt fields. More than 8,000 workers distributed on the salt fields, which were 300 *li* long and 20 or 30 *li* wide, were either holding Baume hydrometers and walking back and forth around the salt fields to check the brine concentration, or lifting water, or doing the final work of repairing the salt fields. The day before the start of sunning, Zhu Jingyun, a national advanced producer and leader of the First Salt Production Plant's team, convened a meeting of all the workers in the team to study the sunning work. The next day, the workers did not wait for the working hours and all went to the salt beach to do their respective work according to the plan.

On the 20th, the entire team filled 72 crystallization ponds with brine and planted salt.

On the first day of sunning at Huaibei Salt Field, 1,893 crystallization ponds were planted with salt. After six or seven days of sea breeze and sun, layers of clean and dazzling new sea salt will appear in these crystallization ponds.

This year, this salt field will produce one million tons of sea salt, exceeding the state plan by 80,000 tons.

Fujian Sea Salt Production Increases

Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Yinglan reports: The output of salt in January and February of this year in the four major salt fields in Fujian Province, namely Putian, Shanyao, Lianhe, and Dongshan, reached more than 224,500 *dan*, an increase of more than two times over the same period last year. The province plans to produce 4.8 million *dan* of salt this year, an increase of 80% over last year.

The salt farmers in Fujian are often shelled by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, and the rainy days this spring have caused many difficulties in production. The salt fields in Lianhe Salt Field, which are more than 20 *li* away from Kinmen Island, have been damaged by Chiang Kai-shek's shells many times this year. However, the salt farmers here quickly repaired the salt fields after each shelling, and batches of snow-white edible salt were transported from here to various places. Salt farmers in various places have also promoted timely brine preservation and other methods to fight against rainy weather. Shanyao Salt Field has also organized a dozen experienced veteran salt farmers to pay attention to studying the climate so as to arrange sunning work according to climate changes.

    抓紧春晒争取海盐大丰收
    辽东半岛海盐春晒开始
    新华社记者徐家柱报道：辽东半岛的气候逐渐转暖，海盐春晒的季节开始了。现在，旅顺盐场的盐工们每天清早醒来，看到山腰上云雾消失，就知道遇上了晒盐的好天气，忙着修平滩池，把浓度卤水灌进一块块方形的盐池。盐工们为了白天有更多的时间晒盐，还在傍晚点上电灯，修平盐池。
    辽宁省较北部的营口、貔口盐场现在也开始灌池晒盐了。
    辽宁省是我国六大海盐区之一，出产的海盐很大一部分是供应本省工业生产用的。今年，辽宁盐务局职工讨论计划结果，决定全年增产海盐十八万八千多吨。
    渤海滩上晒盐忙
    新华社记者刘方辰报道：我国著名的长芦海盐产地——长芦汉沽盐务局所属盐场已经开始春晒。西起汉沽东至羊河口长达三百多华里的渤海滩上，呈现一片动人的劳动景象：太阳刚露出海面，海壋上便传出达达的机器声，工作在扬水机旁的工人，利用海潮不停地把波浪滚滚的海水吸进贮水池，分送到各个盐田；在整齐的棋盘式盐池里，一组组盐工有的澄池，有的压轴，赶作晒盐的最后一道工序——清除池内的浮泥，压实池板；星罗棋布在盐滩上的大型风车，随着柔和的海风不停地旋转着，把卤灌进池子。
    长芦汉沽盐务局各盐场职工今年提出全年增产七万二千八百吨海盐。到3月20日为止，各盐场已经有一千二百三十六个结晶池开始晒盐。
    山东大部盐场开始灌池
    新华社记者高文献报道：山东省绝大部分盐场开始灌池春晒，石岛、日照两盐场已经产出新盐二十二吨。
    各盐场的盐工和盐民为了争取完成全省增产二十八万吨海盐的计划，生产积极性都很高，各单位的出勤率一般都达到95％到98％，有的达到100％。石岛、金口两盐场部分盐民还改变了历来早晨不下滩的习惯，每当天一亮，他们就带着干粮下滩干活。日照盐场有不少盐民为了不误次日的工时，搬到了滩场去住宿。
    淮北盐场开晒的第一天
    新华社记者蒋青萍报道：20日，黄海边的淮北盐场工人带着喜悦的心情，开始了紧张的春季晒盐。
    这一天，阳光照射在海面上，闪闪烁烁，光耀夺目。海上片片白帆，成群海鸥，给蓝色天空作了和谐的点缀。广阔无垠的存满海水的盐滩上，碧波荡漾。成串成排的戽水风车迎着海风，不停地转动，把海水分送到各个盐田。分布在三百里长，二、三十里宽的盐田上的八千多工人，有的拿着波美比重表在盐田周围来回转动，检查卤水浓度；有的在戽水；有的做整修盐田的最后一次工作。开晒的前一天，全国先进生产者、第一制盐场的小组长朱景云召开全组工人会议研究了晒盐工作。第二天，工人没有等到上班时间，全部到了盐滩，有计划地做各人应做的工作。
    20日这一天，全组在七十二块结晶池里灌了卤水，种上了盐。
    淮北盐场在开晒的第一天，有一千八百九十三块结晶池种了盐。这些结晶池经过六、七天的海风吹、太阳晒，将出现一层层洁白耀眼的新海盐。
    今年，这个盐场将生产海盐一百万吨，超过国家计划八万吨。
    福建海盐增产
    新华社记者杨英兰报道：福建省的莆田、山腰、莲河、东山等四个主要盐场，今年1、2月场盐产量达二十二万四千五百多担，比去年同期增加两倍多。今年全省计划产盐四百八十万担，比去年增产80％。
    福建盐民时常受到蒋军炮击，又加上今春阴雨天特别多，在生产上有不少困难。同金门岛相隔二十多华里的莲河盐场的盐田，今年多次被蒋军炮弹破坏，但是这里的盐民们在每次炮击以后，即迅速把盐田修复，一批批雪白的食盐从这里运往各地。各地盐民们还推广了及时保卤等办法，来同阴雨天气作斗争。山腰盐场还组织了十几个有经验的老盐民，注意研究气候，以便根据气候变化安排晒盐工作。
