Xinhua News Agency, March 19th: The statement issued by the Soviet Foreign Ministry on March 16 regarding the plan of the six Western European countries to establish the "European Atomic Energy Community" (Euratom) and the "Common Market" has attracted attention in Western European countries. Government officials in West Germany, one of the participating countries, believe that, "generally speaking," the Soviet proposals contain some "constructive opinions." They said that the West German government will carefully study the Soviet proposals and try to coordinate its views with those of other relevant countries before replying to the Soviet Union.

In Britain, which is closely watching the development of the "Little Europe" plan of the six countries on the European continent, a spokesman for its Foreign Office stated at a press conference on the 18th that the Soviet proposals were "under study." "Le Populaire," the organ of the French Socialist Party, the main ruling party, said that the Western countries had rejected the Soviet Union's proposals on European security issues, and the new concrete proposals put forward by the Soviet Union this time, calling for the development of peaceful cooperation on a pan-European scale, will still be rejected. "Le Parisien Libéré" also asserted: "No Western country will consider the Russian proposals to be serious." However, the French progressive newspaper "Libération" emphasized that the purpose of the Soviet proposals is to establish a "genuine Europe, a Europe where peace can be guaranteed."

Belgian right-wing newspapers described the statement of the Soviet Foreign Ministry as a "propaganda ploy." However, the influential Catholic newspaper "La Libre Belgique" admitted that the Soviet proposals are "very interesting and worthy of attention."

The Swedish newspaper "Dagens Nyheter," which did not participate in the "Little Europe" plan, pointed out in an editorial that the U.S. State Department's hasty dismissal of the Soviet proposals as a "propaganda ploy" was rash. The newspaper emphasized the Soviet Union's concern for international economic cooperation. It said that the Russians are right to say that the "Common Market" will further deepen the division of Europe and make the solution of the German question more difficult. The Norwegian newspaper "Friheten" also expressed similar views.

    苏联关于共同市场和原子能联营声明
    引起西欧政界和舆论的重视
    据新华社19日讯　苏联外交部16日发表的关于西欧六国建立“欧洲原子能联营组织”和“共同市场”计划的声明，在西欧各国引起了注意。计划参加国之一西德的政府人士认为，“一般说来”，苏联的建议包含着某些“建设性的意见”。他们说，西德政府将要仔细地研究苏联的建议，并且在答复苏联之前设法使它的意见同其他有关国家的意见协调一致。
    在密切注意着欧洲大陆上六国“小欧洲”计划的发展的英国，它的外交部发言人18日在记者招待会上表示，苏联的建议“正在研究中”。法国主要执政党社会党的机关报“巴黎人民报”说，西方国家曾经拒绝过苏联关于欧洲安全问题的建议，苏联这一次提出的要求在全欧范围内发展和平合作的新的具体建议仍将被拒绝。“解放了的巴黎人报”也断言：“任何西方国家也不会认为俄国的建议是认真的。”但是法国进步报纸“解放报”强调指出，苏联建议的目的是建立“真正的欧洲、即和平能有保证的欧洲”。
    比利时右派报纸把苏联外交部的声明说成是“宣传手法”。可是有影响的天主教报纸“自由比利时报”承认，苏联的建议“使人很感兴趣，值得注意”。
    没有参加“小欧洲”计划的瑞典的“斯德哥尔摩新闻”在社论中指出，美国国务院急急忙忙地把苏联建议说成是“宣传手法”的作法是轻率的。报纸强调苏联关心国际经济合作。它说，俄国人说，“共同市场”会更加加深欧洲的分裂，会使德国问题的解决更加困难，这些话都是正确的。挪威“自由报”也表示了相类似的意见。
