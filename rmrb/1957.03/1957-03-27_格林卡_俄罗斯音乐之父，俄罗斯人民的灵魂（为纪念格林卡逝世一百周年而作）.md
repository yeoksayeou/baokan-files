    Glinka – Father of Russian Music, Soul of the Russian People
　　(Written in Commemoration of the Centenary of Glinka's Death)
　　Lǚ Jì
    February 15th of this year marks the centenary of the death of M.I. Glinka, the father of Russian music.

    This great Russian musician is not unfamiliar to us. Over the past three decades, as the influence of Russian classical music on us has grown, our understanding of his work has also deepened. As our Party and government call on us to create a new socialist, national culture, commemorating him, studying the path he took, and learning from his experience in creatively developing Russian folk music is of great significance to us.

    Allow me to provide a brief introduction to his life, followed by a discussion of his musical compositions.
　　(I)
    On June 1, 1804, Glinka was born on a landlord's estate near Smolensk, in western Russia. He lived in an era on the eve of the abolition of serfdom in Russia, and also in the period after the Patriotic War of 1812 against Napoleon's invasion, after the failure of the Decembrist Revolt, and during the rise of revolutionary democracy.

    Glinka loved music from a young age, and his young nanny often nourished his young heart with beautiful folk songs and folk tales. Later, the Russian folk songs and folk music often played by the serf orchestra of his uncle's family aroused his deep interest. At this time, he said to people:
  “Music is my soul.” This shows the profound influence music had on him.

    In 1812, when Glinka was eight years old, he experienced the Patriotic War against Napoleon's invasion. Belinsky made a correct evaluation of the Patriotic War of 1812, believing that 1812 was a great era in Russian life, and the life-or-death battle with Napoleon awakened Russia's dormant power. If this Patriotic War inspired the Russian people's patriotic enthusiasm and democratic ideas, it must have had a great impact on the young Glinka, which later blossomed into magnificent flowers, resulting in the immortal patriotic epic – “Ivan Susanin.”

    Although Glinka loved music from a young age, it was not until he was eleven years old that he formally learned piano from a tutor, and at the same time, he learned violin from a serf.

    In 1818, Glinka, at the age of fourteen, left his family and entered the Noble Boarding School attached to the Pedagogical Institute in St. Petersburg. During his five years at this school, he not only gained a solid foundation in cultural and language courses, but also, ideologically, through the inspiration and education of progressive teacher Wilhelm Küchelbecker, his democratic ideas of loving his country, loving freedom, and hating serfdom and autocratic monarchy were further cultivated and developed. At this time, Pushkin's "Ode to Liberty" was widely circulated in St. Petersburg, and Byron's "rebellious" political poems were also spread among students. Students at the boarding school also formed some secret organizations in those years. Glinka once participated in the secret group "Little Russians" organized by Markevich. Pushkin also often came to this school to find his former teacher Küchelbecker and his own brother Lev – another member of the "Little Russians." Glinka often met with them, and these contacts also gave him progressive influences. In music, he continued to study music with private teachers. In addition to learning piano, he also began to study composition. The operas and concerts performed in the theater, and the frequently held family concerts naturally gave him a broader musical knowledge and expanded his range of musical appreciation.

    After graduation, Glinka worked in the Ministry of Transportation for several years, but this did not prevent him from continuing to study music and compose. Many outstanding lyrical songs such as "Do Not Tempt Me" were produced during this period. During this period, he had many contacts with advanced figures, including the Decembrists, and was more closely associated with Pushkin, Griboyedov, Zhukovsky, and others.

    Although Glinka did not participate in the Decembrist organization, he closely followed their activities. On December 14, when the revolt took place on Senate Square, he also went to the square. He witnessed the dark days of the first few years after the uprising. If "the Decembrists awakened Herzen" (Lenin's words), it must have further awakened Glinka's democratic beliefs. The clear democratic tendencies later expressed in his works are closely related to his experiences during this period.

    In 1830, Glinka traveled through Germany and Switzerland to Italy. During these three or four years, he studied Italian and other countries' classical music, opera, and vocal music in a comprehensive and in-depth manner, and also dabbled in Italian drama and fine arts. Here, he also met composers Bellini, Donizetti, Mendelssohn, and Berlioz. In the process of studying Italian classical music, he once wrote some music in the Italian style and received high praise. Some people believed that he was even superior to famous Italian composers like Bellini and Donizetti in polyphonic writing techniques. After such a serious and painstaking study, his writing skills naturally gained beneficial training, but as his understanding of the Italian style deepened and he mastered more, he increasingly realized that he should not follow this path, and that he must follow his own path. "Those 'Memories of Youth' that pleased the residents of Milan and were beautifully decorated, only convinced me that I was not on my own path. I really don't want to become an Italian. Nostalgia for my homeland gradually led me to write in the Russian style." (Notes) Obviously, this conclusion was of great significance to Glinka. This became the starting point for him to later create the most Russian national music. It was precisely because he cherished this noble idea that he later created music rich in profound popular character. The more he went on, the clearer this idea became. In January 1834, he said in a letter from Berlin to a friend: "I think I can also write a large-scale work for our theater that is worthy of it... The main thing is the choice of subject matter. In any case, this subject matter will be completely national. Not only the subject matter, but also the music. So that our dear compatriots feel like they are at home when they hear it, and abroad, they won't treat me like a presumptuous crow trying to adorn itself with other people's feathers."

    In April 1834, he returned to his motherland. Returning to Russia was not only a famous composer with a deep understanding of European classical music, but also a loyal son of the Russian people who was determined to dedicate himself to creating an opera with Russian national characteristics.

    The fifteen years after his return to China were a period of prolific creation for him: in the spring of 1836, he completed his first opera, a patriotic folk heroic tragedy – "Ivan Susanin," which he had begun writing at the end of 1834; six years later, in 1842, he completed his second opera, a magnificent epic based on Pushkin's folk narrative poem of the same name – "Ruslan and Lyudmila"; six years later, in 1848, during his second trip abroad, while residing in Warsaw, he completed an orchestral work that had a profound influence on Russian symphonic music – "Kamarinskaya." While writing these large-scale works, he also completed other orchestral works, "Fantasy Waltz" (1838-39), two Spanish overtures: "Jota Aragonesa" (1845), "Night in Madrid" (1848, revised in 1851), piano piece "Reminiscences of a Mazurka" (1847-48) and many other outstanding lyrical songs and other instrumental pieces.

    After 1848, Glinka lived an almost completely unstable life. In the last ten years, he spent more than six years living in Warsaw, Paris, Berlin, and other places. The time he spent returning to his country each time was very short. Although he had creative aspirations, the spiritual blows inflicted on him by the court aristocracy, coupled with his longing for his motherland when he was abroad, made it impossible for him to concentrate on completing his creations each time. In 1852, when he lived in Paris, he was intensely engaged in writing the program symphony "Taras Bulba." Because he was dissatisfied with the development of the artistic image of the symphony, he put down his pen. In a letter to his sister in November of that year, he said: "Taras cannot continue to be written now. It's strange that I write very little abroad. I always feel that only in my motherland can I do anything. Here, I don't know why, I can't do anything." This was his true situation. After returning to St. Petersburg in 1854, he once again began work on a third opera based on Shakhovskoy's play "The Bigamist" (or translated as "One Woman, Two Husbands"), but later, as his conception of the opera gradually cooled, he was unable to complete it. "Troubles, sorrows, and suffering have destroyed me. I have completely lost courage – I am waiting for spring to arrive so that I can leave here and go somewhere else." This is what he said in a letter on November 29, 1855, which fully illustrates his mood. He went to Berlin with hope, hoping to find a way to create a new Russian style of polyphonic music after studying the ancient Russian musical style there. Therefore, in the last few months in Berlin, he was focusing on studying the ancient Russian musical style. Unfortunately, illness and death prevented him from realizing this plan. He died of illness in Berlin on February 15, 1857. His ashes were later transported back to his motherland and buried in St. Petersburg.
　　(II)
    Although Glinka created great wealth for the Russian people throughout his life, he was constantly subjected to malicious attacks and cold treatment by the court aristocracy. The greater his achievements in his creation, the more suffering, malicious criticism, and slander he suffered. His two operas – two immortal epics of Russian people's lives, his orchestral works "Kamarinskaya" and "Fantasy Waltz," and many lyrical songs like pearls, are all included in the catalog of the world's musical treasures as examples of Russian classical music with distinct Russian national characteristics.

    Glinka laid a solid foundation for Russian classical music with his realistic creative principles. Under the guidance and influence of his creative ideas, Dargomyzhsky, Balakirev, Borodin, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Tchaikovsky, and many other composers created a series of works full of popular character, forming a powerful Russian music school that appeared on the world music scene. Soviet composers inherited the excellent traditions of this school, developed the creative method of socialist realism, and created many symphonies, operas, ballets, chamber music, choruses, songs, and film music that are welcomed by people all over the world, making brilliant contributions to the world's progressive musical culture.

    Realism and popular character are like a red thread running through Glinka's works. This is because Glinka's creation follows an important principle: that is, to be faithful to the people's lives. This principle became the solid ideological foundation of his realism and popular character.

    In Russian music, Glinka was the first to give the people new meaning and new images. He was also the first to truthfully and profoundly express the important position and decisive role of the people and folk heroes in the struggle against national aggression and for national independence in Russian history in the operatic genre.

    His first opera – "Ivan Susanin," is based on the Russian people's war against the Polish feudal lords' aggression in 1612. Susanin was an ordinary peasant who sacrificed his life to defend his country and people. In this opera, Glinka praised Susanin's patriotism and heroism. In fact, he praised not only individual heroes like Susanin, but also the people who produced such individual heroes. In this opera, in addition to Susanin, Vanya and Sobinin are also characters with heroic personalities. Aren't the overture and the final magnificent chorus of the opera the highest praise for the heroic character of the Russian people and their victory? Isn't the entire opera a praise for the Russian people? It was precisely because he followed his own beliefs, was faithful to the people's lives, studied Russian people's lives in depth, and stood firmly on the side of the people that he came to the correct conclusion: in the war against national aggression, the people are the main factor. Only when the people themselves rise up can they achieve victory. The people are an invincible force. This is the same as Griboyedov's analysis of the Patriotic War of 1812. Griboyedov believed that at this critical moment in the history of the country, it was the ordinary people who displayed true heroism. In 1812, it was not the Tsar and his generals who saved Russia, but the ordinary peasants. It was precisely because Glinka had such a clear concept that he was able to truthfully and historically reflect the Russian people's lives and write "Ivan Susanin" into a folk heroic tragedy, a magnificent epic.

    His other opera, "Ruslan and Lyudmila," is a folk life epic with very strong mythological colors based on Pushkin's folk narrative poem of the same name. Ruslan is an ancient Russian folk hero. With unparalleled courage and wisdom, and with the help of good magicians, he rescued Lyudmila, who was taken away by the evil sorcerer using magic. Her father fulfilled his promise, "The person who saves his daughter can marry her." Finally, Ruslan and Lyudmila get married. This is another form of praising the heroism of the Russian people. In this opera, Glinka praised the courage, wisdom, and perseverance of the folk hero Ruslan. Regarding the struggle between good and evil, and the struggle between light and darkness, Glinka represented the people in praising the victory of good and light. Both operas also profoundly demonstrate the psychological character and customs of the Russian people through colorful descriptions of weddings, banquets, and other stylistic life scenes, not only making us feel more truly the fragrance of Russian people's lives, but also enabling us to gain a more authentic understanding of the Russian people and folk heroes.

    Because these two operas truthfully reflected the lives of the Russian people, deeply awakened the people's patriotic enthusiasm and heroism, and at the same time deeply awakened the people's sense of justice in fighting against the forces of darkness and their lofty feelings for "human beings," they also cultivated the people's indomitable will to create a happy life. All of this played an uplifting role for the people at that time and more forcefully strengthened the development of national awakening and democratic ideas. Therefore, his two operas were not welcomed by the aristocratic rulers of the time, and the performances of both operas could not but be obstructed and even sabotaged by them in various ways.

    Glinka did not create many orchestral works, but they are also realistic and popular works and have a great influence on the development of Russian symphonic music. His most famous orchestral work, "Kamarinskaya," was written based on two Russian folk tunes, one is a long, melodious wedding song, and the other is a fast dance tune "Kamarinskaya." Glinka did not adopt any traditional symphonic form here, but this did not prevent him from perfectly expressing the poetry that inspired him. Although the contrast and variation techniques he used with these different tunes were common techniques in Russian music in Glinka's time, he found the reality of this contrast in the lives of the people, especially the possibility of spiritual connection implied in these two tunes. "The feelings of us northerners are different. External impressions either do not move us at all, or they deeply penetrate our hearts. We sometimes rejoice enthusiastically, and sometimes shed bitter tears," (Notes) this is the life basis for his creation of "Kamarinskaya" using the contrast between two tunes. He did not adopt the contrast from the musical form, but constructed this piece from the expression of life and the expression of a change in emotions derived from real life. This gave his music a rich content of life, thus creating a perfect national tone poem. This symphonic work not only became his model for processing Russian folk music themes, but also conceived the creative principles of Russian symphonic music. Tchaikovsky once commented on this work, "Just as the oak tree is conceived in the acorn, Kamarinskaya laid the foundation for Russian symphonic music."

    His other famous symphonic work, "Fantasy Waltz," is also a lyrical poem in which Glinka poured his talent. The whole piece is a river full of youthful life, sometimes shining with the brilliance of fantasy, sometimes blowing in dark melancholy, sometimes hearing deep conversations, and sometimes showing enthusiastic expectations. This is a lyrical, fantastic waltz with very distinct artistic images, which has opened up new territory for dance music and improved the artistry of dance music, thus occupying a special position in Russian dance music.

    Glinka wrote many precious and unforgettable lyrical songs based on the poems of Pushkin, Zhukovsky, and others. Almost every song radiates the brilliance of genius. Like his contributions in opera and orchestral music, his lyrical songs raised the artistic level of Russian lyrical songs to a higher stage. His lyrical songs are thought-provoking with concise and fresh melodies and simple styles. The sincere emotions conveyed by the music penetrate deep into your soul along with the singing and words, arousing the resonance of your excited emotions. This is the sublimation of Russian people's lives, a song from the hearts of the Russian people. His melodies are always so harmoniously combined with the words, as if they were born together, and they are always so easy to understand and make people feel close. They record the life of an era and vividly reveal the true form of the various thoughts and feelings in the people's lives of that era. Excellent songs like "I Remember That Wonderful Moment" (lyrics by Pushkin) will always live in the hearts of the people like flowers, inspiring people to live and create.

    The 19th-century Russian music critic Stasov once compared Glinka with Pushkin in terms of the creation of musical language. He said, "Pushkin and Glinka both created a new Russian language – one in poetry and the other in music." This is a very fair judgment. Glinka is indeed a rare genius in the creation of musical language. He has created a rich and easy-to-understand musical language with sincere emotions and extremely distinct national characteristics in opera, orchestral music, and lyrical songs. This is because he has had an extremely close relationship with Russian folk music since childhood, and the tones of the Russian people have flowed in his heart like blood. On the other hand, his advanced democratic ideas and patriotic spirit also made him especially cherish Russian folk music and understand it extremely deeply. This makes it easy for us to recall his famous saying that everyone is familiar with: "It is the people who create music, and composers only arrange them into tunes." This shows how respectful and humble he was towards the people and the people's musical creation!

    Precisely because he respected the people's musical creation, he was able to absorb infinite nourishment from folk music and create an infinitely rich musical language. When any character in his opera sings a tune that Glinka carefully structured for them with rich expressiveness, plus extremely economical and figurative accompaniment appears in front of the audience, the audience feels very familiar with him, understands him very well, and often leaves a deep impression. This is precisely because he is good at creating a rich musical language and can vividly express the character's true emotions. Perhaps for this reason, Gorky affectionately called him "Magician Glinka."

    Glinka not only cherished Russian folk music, but also cherished the music of other nations. He had a great interest in Spanish music. In order to study Spanish music, he lived in Spain for two years. After studying Spanish music, he wrote two Spanish overtures. The situation in which he studied Spanish folk music has some touching records in his letters and notes. Below I excerpt two paragraphs:
      "There are many interesting things in music, but it is not easy to explore these folk songs; what is even more difficult is to grasp the nationality of Spanish music – this aroused my uneasy imagination, and I have always been the same, the more difficult the goal is to achieve, the more tenacious and persevering the ambition to achieve it." (July 18, 1845, i.e., June 6 of the old calendar)

    "I am studying Spanish music carefully... The most popular songs and dances in Granada are Fandangos. It begins with playing the guitar, and then almost every participant takes turns singing a satirical song, while dancing in pairs with castanets. This kind of song and dance is so original that even now, I can't fully understand these tunes, because everyone sings their own. In order to fully understand them, I study with the local first-class dance teachers three times a week, and my hands and feet are constantly busy. You may be surprised, but here music and dance are inseparable. My research on Russian folk music in my youth led me to create the music for operas such as "A Life for the Tsar" (i.e., "Ivan Susanin") and "Ruslan and Lyudmila." I hope my current work is not in vain." (January 29, 1846, i.e., January 17 of the old calendar)

    We must not forget that he was already in his forties at this time, but he still studied as enthusiastically, carefully, and painstakingly as a young man, and learned so deeply. If he did not regard folk music as a great art emanating from the people's lives of a nation, as Gogol said, if he did not regard folk music as the soil from which his creation could not leave for even an inch, he could not have produced such a great enthusiasm for learning folk music, nor could he have learned so painstakingly. It was precisely because he explored its nationality so deeply from folk music that he was able to reveal its internal spirit, the essence of people's lives, in a colorful way through appropriate genres and forms. It was precisely because he studied people's lives while studying folk music (when he studied folk music in Spain, he made detailed observations and descriptions of the lives, customs, and nature of the Spanish people. See the letters he wrote in Spain), and in turn, deeply pursued its nationality from folk music – the characteristics of the people's material and spiritual lives, he was able to achieve a more correct understanding of people's lives and their music, so his music often presented fascinating life images derived from people's lives, and his musical language had infinite vitality, being true, perfect, kind, easy to understand, and yet national. This is another important factor why Glinka's music can have a profound popular character.
　　(III)
    Since the May Fourth Movement in 1919, when Western classical music was introduced, the Chinese people began to know this great composer and his music. Chinese musicians Nie Er, Xian Xinghai, Huang Zi, Ren Guang, Zhang Shu, and many musicians today have been inspired and influenced by his patriotic ideas and music full of popular character. They all believe that it is necessary to inherit and promote the excellent traditions of our national music and to create music with our national characteristics based on the people's musical creation and contribute it to the people.

    After liberation, we have had more opportunities to introduce his works and gain a greater understanding of his contributions to musical creation and vocal art. Therefore, he is increasingly respected by musicians, his influence on musicians is also deepening, and at the same time, he will be increasingly loved by the Chinese people. At present, we are building a socialist country. Last year, the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China called on us to create a new socialist, national culture. Our musicians are working hard to create a new socialist, national music culture. We are systematically and step-by-step sorting out and studying our ancient and folk musical heritage. We are also seriously studying Russian and Western European classical music. We are also constantly studying the lives of the working people and constantly helping them carry out musical popularization work. Therefore, widely introducing his works and ideas, and deeply studying his experience in creatively inheriting and developing Russian people's music, increasingly show important significance and role.

    We commemorate the great patriot and revolutionary democrat Glinka. First of all, we must learn from him, learn from his spirit, learn from his experience in loving and creatively developing the musical traditions of the Russian nation, and strive to create our own new socialist, national music culture!

    The outstanding contributions made by the great patriot and revolutionary democrat Glinka to Russian musical culture are also contributions to the world's progressive culture. He guided Russian musical art onto the broad path of popular realism, resulting in the prosperity of Russian music. His great patriotic ideas and popular ideas, like his immortal works, will surely give great encouragement to progressive musicians in all countries, encourage them to follow the path of their own national development, strive for the complete independence of their nations, encourage them to strive for the right to a peaceful and democratic life, and encourage them to strive for the right to develop their own national people's musical culture.

    The great Glinka, the father of Russian music, the soul of the Russian people, will always be respected by the progressive human beings of the world!

    格林卡——俄罗斯音乐之父，俄罗斯人民的灵魂
　　（为纪念格林卡逝世一百周年而作）
　　吕骥
    今年2月15日是俄罗斯音乐之父M·И·格林卡逝世的一百周年纪念日。
    这位伟大的俄罗斯音乐家对于我们不是陌生的。三十几年来，在我国音乐界随着俄罗斯古典音乐对我们影响的日益扩大，我们对他的事业的了解也日益加深。当我们的党和政府号召我们创造社会主义的、民族的新文化的时候，我们纪念他，研究他所走的道路，学习他创造性地发展俄罗斯人民音乐的经验，对我们是具有重大意义的。
    下面请允许我对于他的生平作一简略的介绍，然后再谈他的音乐创作。
　　（一）
    1804年6月1日，格林卡生于俄罗斯西部斯摩棱斯克附近的一个地主庄园中。他生活的年代正是俄罗斯废除农奴制的前夜，也正是1812年抗击拿破仑侵略的卫国战争之后，十二月党人起义失败之后，革命民主主义兴起的时期。
    格林卡从小就喜爱音乐，年青的保姆常以美好的民歌和民间故事滋润着他幼小的心灵。后来，舅父家的农奴乐队经常演奏的俄罗斯民歌和民间音乐引起了他很深的兴趣，这时候他对人说过：
  “音乐就是我的灵魂”。由此可以看出音乐对他的影响之深。
    1812年，格林卡八岁的时候，经历了抗击拿破仑侵略的卫国战争。别林斯基对于1812年的卫国战争曾经作了正确的评价，他认为1812年是俄国生活上伟大的时代，和拿破仑的决死战斗唤醒了俄国沉睡的力量。如果说，这次卫国战争激发了俄罗斯人民的爱国主义热情和民主思想的话，也一定会在少年的格林卡心中发生了巨大的影响，后来才能够开放壮丽的花朵，写成了不朽的爱国主义的史诗——“伊凡·苏萨宁”。
    虽然格林卡从小就喜爱音乐，但直到十一岁时才正式从家庭教师学钢琴，同时在一个农奴那里学小提琴。
    1818年，格林卡十四岁，离开了家庭，进了彼得堡的教育学院附属贵族寄宿学校，在这学校的五年中，他不仅在文化课、语文课方面获得了很好的基础，而且在思想上由于进步教师居赫尔别凯尔的启发与教育，他的爱祖国、爱自由，憎恨农奴制度和君主专制制度的民主思想也得到了进一步的培养与发展。这时候，普希金的“自由颂”在彼得堡传颂一时，拜仑的“叛逆的”政治诗也在学生中传播，寄宿学校的学生在那几年中也成立了一些秘密组织，格林卡曾经参加过马尔凯维支组织的秘密团体“小俄罗斯人”，普希金也经常到这个学校来找他从前的教师居赫尔别凯尔和他自己的弟弟列夫——“小俄罗斯人”的另一成员。格林卡常常和他们见面，这些接触也给了他以进步影响。音乐方面，他向私人教师继续学习音乐，除了学钢琴还开始学习作曲；剧院演出的歌剧、音乐会，经常举行的家庭音乐会自然给了他以更广泛的音乐知识，扩大了他的音乐欣赏范围。
    毕业后，格林卡曾经有好几年在交通部任职，但并没有妨碍他继续研究音乐、进行创作，“不要诱惑我”等许多出色的抒情歌曲就是这个时期中产生的。这时期，他和先进人物的联系很多，其中也包括了十二月党人，和普希金、格列波也多夫、茹可夫斯基等人的交往更密切了。
    格林卡虽然没有参加十二月党人的组织，却密切地关心着他们的活动。12月14日在元老院广场起义的时候，他也到了广场上。起义以后，最初几年的黑暗的日子，他是目击了的。如果“十二月党人唤醒了赫尔岑”（列宁语）也一定更深地唤醒了格林卡的民主信念。后来在他创作中表现的鲜明的民主倾向，和他这时期的经历，是有密切联系的。
    1830年，格林卡经过德国、瑞士到了意大利。在这三、四年中，他多方面地、深入地研究了意大利和其他国家的古典音乐、歌剧、声乐，也涉猎了意大利的戏剧和美术。在这里并且认识了作曲家伯里尼、多尼采蒂、门德尔逊、贝辽兹。在他研究意大利古典音乐的过程中，他曾经按照意大利风格写过一些音乐，并且得到很高的评价，有人认为他在复调写作技巧上，甚至高过伯里尼、多尼采蒂这些意大利名作曲家。经过这样一种认真刻苦的研究，写作技巧自然获得了有益的锻炼，但是当他对意大利风格理解愈深，掌握愈多的时候，也愈益理解到他不应该走这条道路，他必须走自己的道路。“我所写的那些惹得米兰的居民们喜欢的、装帧得很漂亮的‘青年的回忆’，只能使我确信我所走的不是自己的道路，我实实在在不想成为一个意大利人。对祖国的怀念，逐渐引导我按照俄罗斯的方式来写作。”（札记）很明显，这个结论对于格林卡是有重大意义的。这就成为他后来创造了最具有俄罗斯民族性的音乐的出发点。正是由于他怀着这个崇高的意念，才使他后来创造了富有深刻的人民性的音乐。越到后来，这个意念越明确。1834年1月他从柏林给他一个朋友的信中说：“我想我也能给我们的剧院写一部和它相称的大型的作品，……主要是题材的选择。无论如何，这种题材将是完全民族性的。不仅题材如此，音乐也是如此。既要使我们亲爱的同胞听了之后，感到像在自己家里一样，而在国外，也不致使人把我当作妄想用别人的羽毛来打扮自己的、大言不惭的乌鸦一样。”
    1834年4月他回到了祖国。回到俄罗斯的，不仅是一个对欧洲古典音乐修养很深的名作曲家，也是决心要为创造具有俄罗斯民族性的歌剧而献身的俄罗斯人民的忠实的儿子。
    回国后的十五年中，是他创作上丰产的年代：1836年春天完成了开始写于1834年底的他的第一部歌剧，爱国主义的人民英雄悲剧——“伊凡·苏萨宁”；六年之后，1842年完成了他的第二部歌剧，根据普希金的同名的民间叙事诗而写的一部瑰丽的史诗——“卢斯兰与柳德米拉”；再过六年，1848年，在他第二次出国，居留华沙的时候，完成了一部对俄罗斯交响乐具有深远影响的管弦乐作品——“卡玛林斯卡雅”。在写这几部巨大作品的同时，他还完成了另外一些管弦乐作品，“幻想圆舞曲”（1838—39），两部西班牙序曲：“阿拉贡的荷莲舞曲”（1845）、“马德里之夜”（1848，1851年改作），钢琴曲“马估尔卡回忆”（1847—48）等许多卓越的抒情歌曲和其他器乐曲。
    1848年以后，格林卡几乎完全过着不安定的生活，最后的十年中，有六年多的时间生活在华沙、巴黎、柏林等地，每次回国的时间都很短，虽然怀着创作的热望，由于宫廷贵族给予他精神上的打击，在国外时又加上对于祖国的怀念，使他每次都不能全神贯注地完成他的创作。1852年他侨居巴黎时，他曾紧张的从事标题交响乐“塔拉斯·布尔巴”的写作，因为不满意交响乐的艺术形象的发展而搁笔了。这年的11月间他给妹妹的信中说：“塔拉斯现在不能继续写了，奇怪的是我在国外写得很少。我现在总觉得，只有在祖国，我做什么都行，在这里不知怎的，什么都不行。”这就是他的真实情况。1854年，回到彼得堡以后，又曾经根据沙霍夫斯基的剧本“重婚者”（或译“一女二夫”）写第三部歌剧，后来，由于对于这部歌剧的构思渐渐冷淡下来，他没有能够完成。“烦恼、忧愁和苦难毁灭了我，我已经完全失去了勇气——我等待春天到来，好离开这里，到别的地方去。”这是他在1855年11月29日的一封信中所说的，这几句话充分说明了他的心情。他是怀着希望到柏林去的，他希望在那里研究了俄罗斯古代音乐风格后，找到创作新的俄罗斯风格的复调音乐的途径。所以在柏林的最后几个月，正在专心研究俄罗斯古代音乐风格，可惜疾病和死亡阻碍了他去实现这个计划。1857年2月15日病逝于柏林，骨灰后来运回了他的祖国，葬于彼得堡。

    格林卡一生虽然为俄罗斯人民创造了巨大的财富，却不断地受了宫廷贵族的恶意的攻击和冷遇，越是在他创作上获得的成就更大，他所受的苦难、恶意的批评和诽谤也越多。他的两部歌剧——俄罗斯人民生活的两部不朽的史诗，他的管弦乐作品“卡玛林斯卡雅”、“幻想圆舞曲”，以及许多像珍珠一样的抒情歌曲，都以具有鲜明的俄罗斯民族性被作为俄罗斯古典音乐的范例，列入了世界音乐宝库的目录中。
    格林卡以他的现实主义创作原则为俄罗斯古典音乐奠定了巩固的基础，在他的创作思想的教导和影响下，达尔高梅斯基、巴拉基列夫、鲍罗亭、莫索尔斯基、里姆斯基·柯萨科夫、柴可夫斯基以及许多其他作曲家创造了一系列富于人民性的作品，形成了强大的俄罗斯音乐学派，出现在世界乐坛；苏联作曲家正是继承了这个学派的优秀传统，发展了社会主义现实主义的创作方法，创造了许多为全世界人民所欢迎的交响乐、歌剧、舞剧、室内乐、大合唱、歌曲以及电影音乐，在世界进步音乐文化中作了辉煌的贡献。
    现实主义和人民性像一根红线一样贯串在格林卡的作品中，这是因为格林卡的创作中遵循着一个重要的原则：那就是忠实于人民生活，这个原则就成为他的现实主义和人民性的坚固的思想基础。
    在俄罗斯音乐中，格林卡是第一个赋予人民以新的意义和新的形象，他也是第一个用歌剧体裁真实而深刻地表现了人民和人民英雄在俄罗斯历史上反对民族侵略、争取民族独立斗争中占有重大地位，起了决定作用。
    他的第一部歌剧——“伊凡·苏萨宁”，取材于1612年俄罗斯人民反对波兰封建主的侵略战争，苏萨宁是献出了自己的生命保卫了祖国和人民的普通农民，格林卡在这部歌剧中歌颂了苏萨宁的爱国主义和英雄主义。其实，他所歌颂的不只是像苏萨宁这样个别的英雄人物，也歌颂了产生了这样的个别英雄的人民。在这部歌剧中，除苏萨宁以外，瓦惹、索比宁也都是具有英雄性格的人物。歌剧的序幕和最后雄伟的大合唱不正是对于俄罗斯人民的英雄性格和他们的胜利的最高的歌颂么？整部歌剧不就是对于俄罗斯人民的歌颂么？正是由于他遵循了他自己的信仰，忠实于人民生活，他深入地研究了俄罗斯人民生活，并且紧紧地站在人民方面，所以得出了正确的结论；在反对民族侵略战争中，人民是主要的因素，只有人民自己起来，才能取得胜利，人民是不可战胜的力量。这和戈里鲍耶多夫对于1812年的卫国战争的分析是相同的，戈里鲍耶多夫认为在这国家历史上千钧一发的时候，发挥了真正英雄主义的是普通人民，在1812年救了俄国的并不是沙皇和他的将军，而是普通农民。正是由于格林卡具有这样明确的观念，他才能够真实地、历史地反映俄罗斯人民生活，把“伊凡·苏萨宁”写成一部人民英雄悲剧，一部壮丽的史诗。
    他的另外一部歌剧“卢斯兰与柳德米拉”，是根据普希金的同名的民间叙事诗而写成的一部神话色彩非常浓厚的人民生活史诗。卢斯兰是古代俄罗斯的民间英雄，他以无比的勇敢和智慧，在得到了善良的魔法家的帮助，救出了被邪恶的男巫用妖法带走的柳德米拉，她的父亲实践了他的诺言“拯救了他的女儿的人可以和她结婚”，最后，卢斯兰与柳德米拉结婚了。这是歌颂俄罗斯人民的英雄主义的另一种形态。在这部歌剧中，格林卡歌颂了民间英雄卢斯兰的勇敢、智慧和坚毅的意志，对于善良与邪恶的斗争、光明与黑暗的斗争，格林卡代表人民歌颂了善良和光明的胜利。这两部歌剧也都通过对于婚礼、宴会，以及其他风格生活场面以富于色彩的描写，深刻地展示了俄罗斯人民的心理性格和风俗习惯，不仅使我们更真切地感到俄罗斯人民生活的芬芳，也使我们对于俄罗斯人民和人民英雄获得更真实的理解。
    由于这两部歌剧真实地反映了俄罗斯人民的生活，深深地唤醒了人民的爱国主义热情和英雄主义，同时也深深唤醒了人民对于黑暗势力进行搏斗的正义感和对于“人”的崇高的感情，也培养了人民创造幸福生活的不屈不挠的意志。所有这些都对当时的人民起了提高的作用，更加有力地加强了民族觉醒和民主思想的发展，因此，他的两部歌剧不为当时的贵族统治者所欢迎，两部歌剧的演出都不能不遭到他们的多方阻难，甚至于破坏。
    格林卡作的管弦乐作品不很多，但同样是现实主义的人民性的作品，并且对于发展俄罗斯交响乐有巨大的影响。他的最著名的管弦乐作品“卡玛林斯卡雅”是在两首俄罗斯民间曲调基础上写成的，一首是音调悠长的婚礼曲，一首是急速的舞曲“卡玛林斯卡雅”，格林卡在这里没有采用任何一种传统的交响乐形式，但并没有阻碍他完美地表达出唤起他的灵感的诗意；虽然他采用的这种不同的曲调的对比和变奏手法是格林卡时代俄罗斯音乐中习见的手法，但他是从人民生活中找到了这种对比的现实性，特别是他从这两首曲调中隐含的精神上连结的可能性。“我们北方居民的感受是不同的，外界的印象对我们或者是毫无所动，或者是深深地打入心坎；我们有时热烈地欢乐，有时是辛酸的眼泪，”（札记）这就是他创作“卡玛林斯卡雅”采用两首曲调对比的手法的生活根据。他不是从乐曲形式出发而采取对比，是从表现生活，表现一种来源于现实生活的情绪的变化出发而构成这首乐曲；这样便使他的乐曲有了充实的生活内容，因而创造了一首完美的、富于民族性的音诗。这首交响乐作品不仅成为他处理俄罗斯民间音乐主题的典范，并且孕育了俄罗斯交响乐的创作原则，柴可夫斯基曾经论到这个作品，“正像檞树孕育于檞实一样，卡玛林斯卡雅奠定了俄罗斯交响乐的基础。”
    他的另一首著名的交响乐作品“幻想圆舞曲”，同样是格林卡倾注了他的才情的抒情诗篇，全曲就是一条充满着青春的生活的河流，时而闪耀着幻想的光辉，时而吹来了阴暗的忧愁，时而又听到了情深的对话，时而又涌现了热情的期待。这是一部抒情的、幻想的、艺术形象非常鲜明的圆舞曲，为舞蹈音乐开辟了新的园地，提高了舞蹈音乐的艺术性，因而在俄罗斯舞蹈音乐上占有特殊的地位。
    格林卡根据普希金、茹可夫斯基等人的诗写了许多珍贵的、令人难忘的抒情歌曲，几乎每一首都放射着天才的光辉，像他在歌剧和管弦乐方面所作的贡献一样，他的抒情歌曲把俄罗斯的抒情歌曲的艺术水平提高到了更高的阶段。他的抒情歌曲是以简练而清新的曲调和淳朴的风格而引人深思，音乐所传达的真挚的感情随着歌声和词句一同渗入到你的灵魂深处，引起你的激动着的情绪的共鸣。这是俄罗斯人民生活的升华，是从俄罗斯人民心中发出的歌声，他的曲调永远是那么和谐地和词句结合在一起，仿佛天生就是在一起的，也永远是那么易于理解而令人感到亲近。它们记录了一个时代的生活，形象地揭示了那个时代人民生活中的多种思想感情的真实形态。像“我记得那美妙的瞬间”（普希金词）那样一些卓越的歌曲，将永远像鲜花一样活在人民的心灵中，鼓舞着人民生活、创造。
    十九世纪俄罗斯音乐批评家斯塔索夫曾经就音乐语言的创造把格林卡和普希金相提并论过，他说，“普希金和格林卡都创造了新的俄罗斯语言——一个是在诗文里，而另一个是在音乐里。”这是很公允的论断。格林卡在音乐语言创造上，的确是一个稀有的天才，无论在歌剧中、管弦乐中，以及抒情歌曲中都创造了丰富而易于理解，情感真挚而民族性又极其鲜明的音乐语言。这是由于他和俄罗斯民间音乐从幼年时代开始就有着极其密切的关系，俄罗斯人民的音调已经像血液一样，流贯在他心中。而另一方面，他的先进的民主思想和爱国主义精神也使他特别珍爱俄罗斯人民音乐，并且理解极深。这使我们容易想起大家所熟知的他的名言，“创作音乐的是人民，作曲家不过把它们编成曲子而已。”这表明他对于人民和人民的音乐创作是怎样尊重，是何等谦虚的态度啊！
    正因为他尊重人民的音乐创作，所以他能够从民间音乐中吸取无限的营养，能够创造出无限丰富的音乐语言。他的歌剧里的任何一个人物，唱着格林卡为他们精心结构的富于表现力的曲调，再加上极其经济而又有形象的伴奏出现在听众面前的时候，听众就觉得对他很熟悉，很了解他，并且常常留下深刻的印象，这正是由于他善于创造丰富的音乐语言，能够形象地表达了人物的真实情感。大概是由于这个原因，高尔基曾经亲热地称他为“魔术家格林卡”。
    格林卡不仅珍爱俄罗斯民间音乐，同样也珍爱其他民族的音乐。他对于西班牙的音乐曾经发生过很大的兴趣，为了研究西班牙音乐，曾经在西班牙住了两年，研究了西班牙音乐之后，写了两首西班牙的序曲。他学习西班牙民间音乐的情形，在他的书信和札记中有过一些给人感受很深的记载，下面我摘录两段：
      “音乐方面有许多有趣的东西，但要探索这些民间歌曲却并不容易；更困难的是捉摸西班牙音乐的民族性——这就引起了我不安的想像，而我向来都一样，目的愈不容易达到，要求达到它的志向而也愈顽强，愈有恒心。”（1845年7月18日，即旧历6日）
    “我用心学习西班牙音乐……格拉那大最流行的歌曲和舞蹈是芳坦哥舞曲，开始是弹奏吉他，然后是几乎每一个参加者都轮流唱一首讽刺歌，同时成对地跳起打响板的舞来。这种歌舞具有如此的独创性，以致直到现在，我还不能完全认识这些曲调，因为每个人所唱的都是自己编的。为了完全领会它们，我在当地的第一流的舞蹈教师那里学习，每星期三次，我的手脚都忙个不停。你也许会奇怪，但是在这里音乐和舞蹈是不可分的。我在青年时代对俄罗斯民间音乐的研究曾引导我创作出‘为王而生’（即“伊凡·苏萨宁”）和“卢斯兰·柳德米拉”等歌剧的音乐，我希望我现在的奔忙也不是徒劳的。”（1846年1月29日，即旧历17日）
    我们不能忘记，这时候他已经是四十多岁了，但还是像青年一样，那样狂热地、可是细心地、刻苦地学习，并且学得那么深入。如果不是把民间音乐看作一个民族的人民生活中发出来的伟大的艺术，像果戈理所说的那样，如果他不把民间音乐看作是自己的创作一寸也不能离开的土壤的话，他不可能对于民间音乐产生这样巨大的学习热情，也不可能这样刻苦地学习。正因为他是这样深入地从民间音乐中去探索它的民族性，所以他能够把它的内部精神，人民生活的精髓，通过适当的体裁和形式富于色彩地揭示出来。正因为他在研究民间音乐的同时，也研究了人民生活（他在西班牙研究民间音乐时，曾经对于西班牙人民的生活、风俗习惯以及大自然作过精细的观察和描写。见他在西班牙写的书信），反过来，又从民间音乐深入地去追寻它的民族性——人民的物质生活和精神生活的特性，他就能够达到比较正确地理解人民生活和他们的音乐，所以他的音乐也常常能够呈现出从人民生活中得来的、令人神往的生活形象，他的音乐语言也就具有无限的活力，真实、完美、亲切、易解，而又具有民族性。这就是格林卡的音乐为什么能够具有深刻的人民性的另一个重要因素。
　　（三）
    中国人民从1919年五四运动以后，在西洋古典音乐被介绍进来的时候，就开始知道这个伟大的作曲家和他的音乐。中国人民的音乐家聂耳、冼星海、黄自、任光、张曙，以及现在的许多音乐家都曾经受到他的爱国主义思想和富于人民性音乐的鼓舞和影响，都认为必须继承与发扬我们的民族音乐的优秀传统，以人民的音乐创作作为基础去创造具有我们的民族性的音乐，贡献给人民。
    解放后，我们有了更多的机会介绍他的作品，对他在音乐创作和声乐艺术上的贡献获得更多的了解，因此愈益受到音乐家的尊敬，给予音乐家的影响也愈益加深，同时将愈益受到中国人民的热爱。目前，我们正在建设社会主义国家，去年中国共产党第八次代表大会号召我们创造社会主义的、民族的新文化，我们音乐家都在为创造社会主义的、民族的新音乐文化而努力进行自己的工作。我们正在有计划有步骤地整理、研究我国古代的和民间的音乐遗产，我们也正在认真地学习俄罗斯和西欧古典音乐，我们也在不断地研究劳动人民的生活，并且不断地在帮助他们进行音乐普及工作。因此，广泛地介绍他的作品和思想，深入地研究他创造性地继承与发展俄罗斯人民音乐的经验，愈益显示了具有重要的意义和作用。
    我们纪念伟大的爱国主义者、革命民主主义者格林卡，我们首先要向他学习，学习他的精神，学习他热爱和创造性地发展俄罗斯民族的音乐传统的经验，为创造我们自己社会主义的、民族的新音乐文化而努力！
    伟大的爱国主义者、革命民主主义者的格林卡对于俄罗斯音乐文化所作的卓越的贡献，也就是对于世界进步文化的贡献。他引导了俄罗斯音乐艺术走上广阔的人民现实主义的道路，产生了俄罗斯音乐的繁荣。他的伟大的爱国主义思想和人民思想和他的不朽作品一样，一定会给世界各国进步音乐家莫大鼓舞，鼓舞他们遵循他们自己的民族发展的道路，争取他们的民族的完全独立，鼓舞他们去争取和平民主生活的权利，鼓舞他们去争取发展他们自己的民族的人民音乐文化的权利。
    伟大的格林卡是俄罗斯音乐之父，俄罗斯人民的灵魂，将永远受到世界进步人类的尊敬！
