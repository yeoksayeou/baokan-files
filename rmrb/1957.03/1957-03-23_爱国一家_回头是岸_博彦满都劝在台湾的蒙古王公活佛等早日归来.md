Patriotic Family, Repent and Return
Boyan Mandu Urges Mongolian Princes, Living Buddhas, and Others in Taiwan to Return Soon

I listened to Chairman Mao's twelve instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people at the enlarged session of the Supreme State Conference, and I felt extremely excited and received profound education and enlightenment. I realized that Chairman Mao's instructions are arming us with new strength to rapidly complete the socialist cause of the motherland, and are the greatest encouragement and powerful call to the people of all ethnic groups in the country. With infinite love, I support this call and will definitely implement the spirit of the instructions, strengthen learning, and work hard.

I listened to Premier Zhou's report on his visit to eleven Asian and European countries, as well as the various reports from Vice Premiers Chen and Li, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and various central leaders. I sincerely support and fully agree with them.

Now, I would like to say a few words to the Mongolian princes, living Buddhas, and military and political personnel in Taiwan regarding the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

To the Mongolian princes, living Buddhas, and military and political personnel in Taiwan, I urge you to return to the embrace of the motherland and return to your hometown, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, as soon as possible. Do not have any more doubts or worries, and do not miss the opportunity. A patriotic family, repentance is the shore. As long as you have a change of heart and resolutely return, you will definitely receive lenient treatment from the people of all ethnic groups and the People's Government.

I tell you that today's motherland is a large family of unity and love among all ethnic groups. Today's motherland is vastly different from the past, prosperous and strong, and completely new. There is no need for me to say more. I will only quote the words of an international friend, and you will know. When the head of the World International Buddhist Monks Delegation, Master Ananda, who visited our country last year, reported his impressions to the Indian people, he said: "Some people say China is heaven, and some people say China is hell. I say China is a country that is moving from hell towards heaven, and for many countries today, it is already heaven." These are the honest words of Master Ananda based on objective understanding.

May 1st of this year is the tenth anniversary of the liberation of Inner Mongolia and the implementation of national regional autonomy under the leadership and help of the Chinese Communist Party. Various grand celebrations will be held in Hohhot, the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. We have prepared various exhibitions on agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, culture, and art, and we are preparing to perform ethnic songs and dances, equestrianism, bukh (wrestling), horse racing, archery, and other "Nadam" (festivals). All of this is enough to show that under the shining light of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao's ethnic policies, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has made remarkable achievements in political, economic, and cultural construction over the past ten years. At that time, we will also invite foreign guests and representatives of fraternal ethnic groups from all over the country to participate, and I also hope that you—the Mongolian princes, living Buddhas, and military and political personnel in Taiwan—will strive to come and participate.

    爱国一家　回头是岸
    博彦满都劝在台湾的蒙古王公活佛等早日归来
    我在最高国务会议扩大会议上听了毛主席正确处理人民内部矛盾的十二项指示，感到无比的兴奋，受到极深刻的教育和启发。我体会到毛主席的指示是在迅速完成祖国社会主义事业上，以新的力量来武装了我们，是对全国各族人民最大的鼓励和有力的号召。我以无限热爱的心情拥护这个号召，一定要贯彻指示的精神，加强学习，努力工作。
    我听了周总理访问亚欧十一个国家的报告和陈、李两位副总理，陈叔通副主席以及中央各位首长的各项报告，衷心拥护，完全同意。
    现在，我想就和平解放台湾对在台湾的蒙古王公活佛和军政人员说几句话。
    在台湾的蒙古王公活佛和军政人员，我劝告你们应该早日回到祖国怀抱，回到自己的家乡——内蒙古自治区来。你们不要再有什么怀疑顾虑，坐失良机。爱国一家，回头是岸，只要你们幡然悔悟，毅然归来，一定能够得到祖国各族人民和人民政府的宽大待遇。
    我告诉你们，祖国今天是各族人民团结友爱的大家庭，今天的祖国，比起过去真有天渊之别，大不相同，已经是繁荣富强，焕然一新了。这，不用我来多说，我只引用一位国际友人的话，你们就知道了，去年来我国访问的世界国际佛教僧侣代表团团长阿难陀法师在向印度人民报告他的感想时说：“有人说中国是天堂，也有人把中国说成地狱。我说中国是这么一个国家，它从地狱走向着天堂，而且对今天许多国家来说，它已经就是天堂。”这是阿难陀法师从客观了解上说的实在话。
    今年的五月一日，是我们内蒙古在中国共产党的领导、帮助下，获得了解放，施行民族区域自治的十周年纪念日。届时将在内蒙古自治区首府呼和浩特市举行各种盛大的庆祝活动。我们已准备了农业、牧业、工业、文化艺术等各种展览，并准备表演民族歌舞、马术、布奎（摔跤）、赛马、射箭等各项“那达木”（大会）。凡此种种，足以说明：在中国共产党和毛主席民族政策的光辉照耀下，内蒙古自治区十年来在政治、经济、文化建设各方面已有了显著发展的伟大成就。届时，我们还邀请外宾和国内各兄弟民族的代表前来参加，我也盼望你们——在台湾的蒙古王公活佛和军政人员争取到来参加。
