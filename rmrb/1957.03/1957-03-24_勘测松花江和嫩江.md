　　Surveying the Songhua and Nen Rivers

　　(Our report) The Harbin Survey and Design Institute of the Ministry of Water Resources recently dispatched ten survey teams, totaling more than 1,000 people, to the upper reaches of the Songhua River and the Nen River basin to carry out surveying work.

　　Braving the severe cold, they will conduct ice-based river cross-section measurements of the main streams and downstream tributaries of the Songhua River from Harbin to the Nen River and the upper reaches of the Songhua River, including the Lalin River, Tao'er River, Yalu River, and Nuomin River, to create conditions for further exploration and surveying of the Songhua River's water resources.

　  勘测松花江和嫩江
    本报讯　水利部哈尔滨勘测设计院最近派出十个测量队共一千多人，分赴松花江上游和嫩江流域进行测量工作。
    他们冒着严寒，将从哈尔滨至嫩江、松花江上游的干流和支流下游的拉林河、洮儿河、雅鲁河、诺敏河等河流进行冰上的河道断面测量，为进一步开发松花江水利资源的勘测工作创造条件。
