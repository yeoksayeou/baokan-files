    The Wishes of the People of Gaza
    Chen Bojian, Zhang Chanhua

Early on March 8th, more than twenty foreign and Egyptian journalists set off from Cairo to visit the Gaza region. For nearly eight years, Gaza has been a troubled area; recently, it has become one of the regions in the Middle East that has attracted much attention. This narrow strip of land originally had more than 90,000 residents, but in recent years it has gathered more than twice the number of Palestinian Arab refugees as the original residents.

We arrived in Al-Arish by Misr Airlines plane, and then transferred to Gaza by car.

Al-Arish Airport is built on an extremely desolate desert. It is only through people's unyielding efforts that some trees have been planted here, but none of them grow taller than two people. Canadian, Brazilian, and Indian soldiers from the United Nations Emergency Force are stationed here.

We sped along the highway in a military truck driven by Canadian soldiers. Although the road was good, we were often thrown from our seats, making everyone laugh. People had to adopt various postures to try to maintain stability.

One trip on the highway cannot determine the entire natural landscape of the Gaza region. The route may be the best area in the region, with lush green vegetable gardens interspersed with desolate deserts, as well as small fields surrounded by deserts. People and the desert are engaged in a struggle. The boundaries between many fields and the desert are very vague. The desert is still trying to regain lost territory, using soft but cruel desert sand to suppress the tender seedlings and suffocate the life of the plants.

After passing Rafah, we entered the Gaza region. The journalists all paid attention to the things they encountered along the way, and took out their notebooks to take notes on the bumpy car, often tearing the paper.

West of Rafah, we encountered a truck also heading to Gaza. The truck was crowded with people, refugees who had fled Gaza not long ago to escape the persecution of the Israelis, and now they were going home. Near Rafah, we saw another truck carrying refugees being stopped at a United Nations forces checkpoint. This is the first line of outposts of the United Nations forces in this area.

In the Gaza region, every settlement is crowded with people, the crowd is so large that it is surprising, as if everyone has poured into the streets and highways. Portraits of President Nasser are hung in the air above the road, pasted on the windows of taxis, and held in people's hands. In Yunis, people are holding rallies, holding huge religious flags and slogans embroidered with Arabic characters. These slogans demand that the Gaza region be returned to Egyptian administration.

The residents of Gaza City are also holding a meeting. This day is the first Friday—the Islamic Sabbath—in the one hundred and fifty-two days since the Israeli occupation. After finishing the prayer ceremony, people gathered in the square in the city center. Munir, the former mayor who was just released from prison by the United Nations forces yesterday, is giving a passionate and excited speech on the stage, demanding the restoration of Egyptian administration here.

This place has something in common with Port Said when it was first liberated, that is, the excitement and emotion of celebrating liberation from the occupation of the invaders. But this place is not entirely the same as Port Said. People express a sense of anxiety and indignation in their revelry. This emotion arouses more people, and their actions are more consistent and firmer. Some American journalists in our group seemed a little uncomfortable with this emotion. A journalist from the International News Service said coldly in his American nasal voice: "This is all organized!" It seems that American journalists, like their politicians, are very unhappy with people who are excited about taking control of their own destiny.

The journalists left the meeting square and came to the headquarters of the United Nations Emergency Force in Gaza. We met Corden, the press officer of the United Nations Emergency Force, in the courtyard. Someone asked him when the Egyptian civil administration and army would return to Gaza. He replied: This is a question that everyone is very concerned about, but the situation here is different from Port Said and the Sinai Peninsula. Even General Burns cannot make any decisions about its future status, but only wait for the United Nations General Assembly to decide.

This answer is not true. The people of Gaza have already made their own decisions. Those who just finished the meeting are marching in the streets in batches. The marching teams all passed in front of the headquarters of the United Nations forces, and some even stood there for a while. The speakers who were held high by the people shouted slogans indignantly: "Long live Nasser!" "Gaza is an inseparable part of Egypt!" "We welcome the return of the Egyptian government to Gaza!" "Oppose the United Nations occupation of Gaza!" Countless slogans also read: "Welcome you as guests, but we do not welcome you as occupying forces!"

In the square opposite the headquarters of the United Nations forces, some military vehicles with machine guns were parked, and more crowds surrounded them. People looked at them with a suspicious eye. The surrounded soldiers sat silently in the car, looking a little embarrassed.

On the fourth day after the United Nations forces entered the Gaza region, the United Nations forces appointed a "military governor" and designated institutions to manage the municipality. News that the United States had assured Israel that it would obstruct Egypt's recovery of Gaza also continued to come, causing great indignation among the people of Gaza. On March 10, the number of people participating in the demonstration reached 15,000. Many more people were blocked in refugee camps outside the city and could not enter the city to participate in the demonstration. In front of the headquarters of the United Nations forces, the United Nations army opened fire on people preparing to raise the Egyptian flag, fired tear gas at the demonstrating masses, and arrested some demonstrators.

However, the people of Gaza did not stop their actions demanding that the Egyptian government return to the Gaza region. The people of Rafah and Yunis demanded that the United Nations forces lower their flags within twenty-four hours. The five members of a committee appointed by the United Nations forces to manage civil affairs also stated that they could only perform their duties with the consent of the Egyptian government. It is said that Danish Colonel Engholm, who was appointed as the "military governor," is worried about not finding anyone to cooperate with him. On March 15, the administrative governor of the Gaza region appointed by the Egyptian government had announced the takeover of Gaza's administrative power. It seems that despite the United States' collusion with Israel in an attempt to have the United Nations forces stationed in Gaza indefinitely and obstruct the people of Gaza from returning to the embrace of their own country; but this will not succeed, because the people of Gaza demand that the Gaza region return to Egyptian administration, and they are determined to return to the embrace of their own country.

    加沙人民的愿望
    陈伯坚　章蟾华
    3月8日绝早，二十多名外籍记者和埃及记者从开罗出发去访问加沙地区。近八年来，加沙一直是多事的地区；最近更变成了中近东局势中大家重视的地区之一。这个狭长的地带原来有九万多居民，近几年又集聚了人数超过原住居民两倍以上的巴勒斯坦阿拉伯难民。
    我们乘米色尔航空公司的飞机到达阿里希，再从那里换乘汽车到加沙。
    阿里希机场筑在极为荒凉的沙漠上。只是由于人们的顽强的努力，才在这里种了一些树木，但没有一棵长得比两个人更高。这里驻有联合国紧急部队中的加拿大、巴西和印度士兵。
    我们坐着由加拿大士兵驾驶的军用卡车在公路上奔驰，虽然公路是很好的，但还是常常被从座位上掀起来，弄得大家哈哈大笑。人们不得不采取各种姿式力求保持稳定。
    只在公路上跑一趟无法判定加沙地区整个的自然面貌。沿线可能是这个地区最好的地带，这里有浓绿的菜园和荒凉的沙漠相间，也有在沙漠包围中的小块田地。人和沙漠正在进行着搏斗，有许多田地和沙漠的界线很模糊，沙漠还在极力夺回已经失去的地盘，用细软的但是残忍的荒沙压住嫩苗，窒息着植物的生命。
    过了拉法以后就进入加沙地区。记者们都注视着沿途所遇到的事物，并且掏出小本子在颠波的车子上作记录，时常把纸截破。
    在拉法以西，我们曾遇到一辆也是向加沙开去的卡车。车上挤满了人，这是不久前为了逃避以色列人的迫害从加沙逃出来的难民，现在他们要回家了。在靠近拉法的地方，又见到了同样装着难民的卡车被阻在联合国部队的检查哨前。这是联合国部队在这个地区的第一道哨线。
    在加沙地区，每一个居民点都挤满了人，人群之多达到使人惊讶的程度，好像一下子都涌到大街上和公路上来了。纳赛尔总统的肖像挂在公路上空，贴在出租汽车的窗子上，举在人们的手里。在尤尼斯，人们正在举行集会，手里举着巨大的绣有阿拉伯文的宗教旗帜和标语。这些标语要求加沙地区重归埃及管理之下。
    加沙城的居民也在开会。这天是以色列占领后一百五十二天以来的第一个星期五——伊斯兰教的礼拜日。人们结束了礼拜仪式以后，聚集到了城市中心的广场。昨天刚被联合国部队从监狱里释放出来的原市长慕尼尔，正在台上作热情激动的演说，要求恢复埃及在这里的管理。
    这里和刚解放时的塞得港有其相同之处，这就是人们欢庆从侵略者占领之下解放出来的那种兴奋和激动。但这里和塞得港又不尽相同，人们在狂欢中都表现一种忧惧和激愤的情绪，这种情绪激起更多的人，而且他们的行动表现得更一致，更坚定。对这种情绪，同行的一些美国记者似乎感到有些不自在。国际新闻社的一个记者用他的美国鼻音冷冰冰地说：“这都是组织起来的！”看来，美国记者也和他们的政治家一样，对于为了自己掌握自己命运而兴奋的人们都是很不喜欢的。
    记者们离开集会的广场，来到加沙联合国紧急部队的总部。在院子里遇见了联合国紧急部队的新闻官考登，有人问他，埃及的民政当局和军队何时回到加沙。他回答说：这是一个大家都很关心的问题，但这里的情况不同于塞得港和西奈半岛，它的未来地位甚至伯恩斯将军也不能作出任何决定，而只有等待联合国大会来决定。
    这个回答是不确实的。加沙人民已经作出了自己的决定。刚才结束集会的那些人，一批一批地在街上游行。游行的队伍都走过联合国部队总部的门前，有的并且在那里站上一会。被人们高高抬起来的演讲者，愤激地喊着这样一些口号：“纳赛尔万岁！”“加沙是埃及不可分割的一部分！”“我们欢迎埃及政府返回加沙！”“反对联合国占领加沙！”无数标语上也写着：“欢迎你们来作客，不欢迎你们作占领军！”
    在联合国部队总部对面的广场上，停着一些架着机关枪的军用车辆，更多的人群围在周围，人们用一种疑惧的眼光看着它们。被围观的士兵默默地坐在车上，显得有些尴尬。
    联合国部队进入加沙地区以后的第四天，联合国部队委派了“军事总督”，并且指定了管理市政的机构。美国向以色列保证要阻挠埃及收复加沙的消息也不断传来，引起了加沙人民的极大愤慨。3月10日，参加示威的人数达到一万五千人。还有许多人被阻在城外的难民营里未能进城参加示威。在联合国部队总部前面，联合国军队向准备升埃及国旗的人开了枪，向示威的群众发射催泪弹，并且逮捕了一些示威者。
    但是，加沙人民并没有停止他们要求埃及政府回到加沙地区来的行动。在拉法和尤尼斯的人民，要求联合国部队在二十四小时内降下他们的旗帜。联合国部队指定的管理民政的一个委员会的五位委员，也声言要得到埃及政府的同意他们才能执行职务。据说，被委派为“军事总督”的丹麦上校恩格霍姆，正在为找不到人和他合作而感到烦恼。3月15日，埃及政府任命的加沙地区的行政长官已经宣布接管加沙的行政权。看来，尽管美国勾结以色列企图使联合国部队无限期留驻加沙，阻挠加沙人民回到自己国家的怀抱；但这是不会成功的，因为加沙人民要求加沙地区重归埃及管理，他们坚决要回到自己国家的怀抱里来。
