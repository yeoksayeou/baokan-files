Guangxi Xincheng County

Solving Drinking Water Difficulties for Farmers in Mountainous Areas

(Our report) To solve the problem of drinking water difficulties for farmers in mountainous areas, Xincheng County, Guangxi, completed more than one hundred drinking water projects in early January, greatly encouraging farmers of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas.

The mountainous population of Xincheng County accounts for 23.7% of the county's total population, and the semi-mountainous population accounts for 29.83%. For many years, people's lives have been extremely difficult due to the lack of drinking water. Every year, from October to the following spring, for more than five months, the water source is most scarce, and many villages and settlements have to fetch water from places several miles, or even twenty miles away. After winter, the masses dare not raise pigs anymore. Other places produce in the spring and also produce in the winter, but in this area, fetching water is enough work.

In order to solve the difficulty of drinking water for people and livestock in mountainous areas and develop mountainous production, Xincheng County has been organizing forces to plan, prepare materials, and train water conservancy technicians for drinking water projects for people and livestock in mountainous areas since August last year, and has been starting construction one after another. With the enthusiastic support of the broad masses, by early January this year, 120 drinking water projects for people and livestock have been completed, solving the drinking water problems for 1,500 households with more than 7,000 people and nearly 10,000 livestock. Farmers in mountainous areas have been greatly encouraged, and pig raising has also greatly increased. At present, the county is also preparing to continue building 76 drinking water projects.

    广西忻城县
    解决山区农民饮水困难
    本报讯　广西忻城县为解决山区农民的饮水困难，1月上旬已完成了一百多处饮水工程，山区各族农民受到极大鼓舞。
    忻城县山区人口占全县人口的23.7％，半山区人口占29.83％。多少年来，由于缺乏饮水，人民生活极为困难。每年从10月到次年春天五个多月内，水源最缺，很多村、屯都要到几里、甚至二十里以外的地方去挑水吃。入冬以后，群众也再不敢养猪。别的地方春天生产，冬天也生产，而这地区光挑水吃就够做了。
    为了解决山区人畜饮水的困难，发展山区生产，忻城县从去年8月起，就组织力量进行山区人畜饮水工程规划、备料和训练水利技术员，并陆续兴工。在广大群众热烈支援下，到今年元月上旬，已完成了一百二十处人畜饮水工程，解决了一千五百户七千余人和近万头牲畜饮水的问题。山区农民受到很大鼓舞，养猪也大大增加。目前，这个县还准备继续兴修七十六处饮水工程。　（雷爱英）
