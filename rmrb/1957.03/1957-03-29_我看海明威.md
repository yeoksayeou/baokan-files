　　My View of Hemingway
　　冯亦代
　　After reading the article "Writers and Businessmen" in the People's Daily on March 12, I feel that its view of Hemingway is worth discussing.
　　Hemingway is not a writer who caters to the tastes of general American readers. Although his novels are not without plots of male and female love, the significance of his works lies in writing about the heavy sense of disillusionment with modern capitalist society since World War I. He hated the death and spiritual bankruptcy that capitalist society brought to mankind, but he could not see the essence of human social development. Disappointed, he mistakenly regarded the various aspects of the world as merely a functional action of mankind, and he himself was a recorder who coldly watched these actions. Under the control of this worldview, he wrote "A Farewell to Arms," which laid his position in American modern literature. This is an anti-war novel, but also a cold book; because he felt disillusioned with the world, and pessimistic and disappointed with the belief in human life. But even though there are many unhealthy and biased concepts in the book, he also wrote the reality of the lives of a generation at that time. He believes that "writing is a matter that requires honesty and labor." He himself felt this, and his contemporaries felt this, so he could not betray his conscience and paint the suffering that war brought to the world into a picturesque scene.
　　During the Spanish Civil War, he worked as a war correspondent in the Madrid government army. Although his attitude towards life was still consistently cold, he could not be indifferent to the heroic struggle of the Spanish people against fascism; he wrote about the anti-Japanese deeds of the Spanish people in "The Old Man at the Bridge" (short story), "The Fifth Column" (drama), and "For Whom the Bell Tolls" (novel) and other works. In these works, even if he still views these tragic people from a fatalistic point of view, he has regained his trust and joy in life (Hemingway: "Lament for Americans Killed in Spain"). In his recent "The Old Man and the Sea," we can more clearly see his new view of life - showing the power of people and the persistent hope for life from the old man's struggle in nature. This transformation should be welcomed by us.
　　In capitalist society, if a writer does not write for royalties, his survival will become a problem. Some writers, such as Steinbeck, can easily sell the right to revise their articles to publishing merchants for royalties; but Hemingway does not seem to be comparable to them. I remember when "For Whom the Bell Tolls" was made into a film by Hollywood, because the film company boss arbitrarily changed the original work, Hemingway announced that he was not the author of the film and was very angry, which shows that he is still a person who loves his labor and is loyal to his works.
　　The basis of the article "Writers and Businessmen" is a piece of news in Benet Cerf's "Trade Winds" column in the American "Saturday Review." The "Saturday Review" is an old reactionary magazine, mainly providing some promotional articles for booksellers who publish new book advertisements. As for Benet Cerf himself, he was originally a so-called columnist who started by writing insider news, low-level interest, and humorous articles. Moreover, the original text did not mention who the editor of the newly established magazine is, and it is not something that some poor scholars can do to run a magazine in the United States today. What obligation does Hemingway have to write articles without royalties for that editor who is full of "business acumen"?
　　In American modern literature, Hemingway is known to the world as a stylist; therefore, measuring whether he is a writer should mainly focus on his works. If he is evaluated based on a piece of yellow tabloid news, wouldn't it be unjust?

### 我看海明威

　　我看海明威
　　冯亦代
    读了人民日报3月12日“作家和商人”一文，觉得它对海明威的看法是值得商榷的。
    海明威不是个迎合一般美国读者口胃的作家。固然在他所写的小说中，也不乏那些男欢女爱的情节，但是他的作品的意义，却在于写出了对于第一次世界大战以来的现代资本主义社会的那种沉重的幻灭之感。他憎恨资本主义社会为人类带来的死亡和精神破产，可是他看不清人类社会发展的本质，失望之余，便错误地把人世的形形色色看作只是人类的一种官能动作，而他本人则是个对这些动作冷眼旁观的记录人。在这种宇宙观的控制下，他写了奠定他在美国现代文学中地位的“永别了武器”。这是一本反对战争的小说，也是一本冷酷的书；因为他对于人世感到幻灭，对于人类生活的信仰悲观失望。可是即使书里多的是这种不健康的偏颇观念，他却也写出了当时一代人生活的真实。他认为“写作是件需要诚实和劳动的事情”。他自己有感于此，他的同时代人有感于此，他就不能昧了良心而把战争带给人世的苦难涂抹成一片花团锦簇的彩绘。
    在西班牙内战时期，他在马德里政府军中作战地记者，虽然他看生活的态度还是一贯的冷酷，对于西班牙人民反法西斯的英勇奋斗，却也不能无动于衷；他在“桥上的老人”（短篇），“第五纵队”（戏剧），和“丧钟为谁鸣”（长篇）及其他几篇作品中写下了西班牙人民的抗战事迹。在这些作品里，即使他仍从宿命论观点去看这些悲壮赴难的人，他却恢复了对于生活的信任和欢欣（海明威：“哀在西班牙战死的美国人”）。而在他近年所写的“老人与海”中，更可以清晰地看出他对于生活的新看法——从老人在大自然中的搏斗，显示出人的力量和对于生活的执着的希望。这种转变是该受到我们欢迎的。
    在资本主义社会中，如果一个作家不为稿费写作，那他之能否生存都会成问题。也有些作家如史坦贝克之流，可以为了稿费，轻易地把自己文章的删改权完全出卖给出版商人；但海明威似乎还不能和他们相提并论。记得当年“丧钟为谁鸣”由好莱坞摄成影片时，由于影片公司老板擅自改动了原作，曾使海明威宣布这张影片的作者不是他，而且大为生气，可见他还是一个热爱自己劳动、忠诚于自己作品的人。
      “作家和商人”一文的根据，是美国“星期六评论”本耐德·塞尔夫所写“贸易风”专栏中的一段消息。“星期六评论”是本老牌的反动杂志，主要是替那些登新书广告的书商提供一些有利于推销的评介文章。至于本耐德·塞尔夫其人，原是个写写内幕新闻、低级趣味、幽默文章起家的所谓专栏作家。何况原文没有提到新创办杂志的编辑究竟是何许人，而在目前美国要办一本杂志，也不是一些穷书生所能做到的。海明威又有什么义务要替那位“生意经”十足的编辑写没有稿费的文章呢？
    在美国现代文学中，海明威以文体家见称于世；因此，衡量他是否是个作家似乎主要该从他的作品着眼。如果只根据一则黄色小报式的新闻就来评价他，岂非冤哉。
