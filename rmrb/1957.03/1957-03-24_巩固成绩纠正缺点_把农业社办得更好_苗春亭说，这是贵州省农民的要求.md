I fully support Chairman Mao's instructions and Premier Zhou's report. Now, I will give a rough speech on some of the situations of agricultural cooperativization in Guizhou.

As everyone knows, Guizhou is a mountainous province with a mixed population of various ethnic groups. There is still very little industry. How to lead farmers of all ethnic groups to run cooperatives well, develop mountain production, support national industrialization, and improve farmers' lives is the most important issue in the province's work.

1956, the first year after the realization of cooperativization, can be said to be a year of harvest. Although the climatic conditions were not particularly favorable, and 12 counties suffered severe droughts, the total grain output still increased by more than 1.1 billion jin compared to 1955, an increase of more than 13%. Most industrial raw material crops also had good harvests, and forestry and special products, as well as animal husbandry production, except for pork pigs, also increased. This has played a certain role in supporting national industrial construction and improving farmers' lives. From the perspective of improving farmers' lives, the average grain retention per farmer increased by more than 70 jin of raw grain. Cash income also increased. According to autumn harvest distribution statistics, 82% of the cooperative members increased their income (winter sideline production income is not included). Actual life has proven the superiority of cooperatives.

	Though Cannot Ascend to Heaven in One Step, We Are Stepping Up Step by Step

Farmers can already understand the benefits of cooperatives from their own personal experience. Take Duo Dang in Lushan County as an example. This small village is inhabited by 13 households of ethnic minority farmers. In 1954, they were mutual aid groups, with an average income of 39.7 yuan and a grain retention of 480 jin per person; in 1955, they were elementary cooperatives, with an income of 46.1 yuan and a grain retention of 540 jin per person; in 1956, they were advanced cooperatives, with an income of 54.8 yuan and a grain retention of 553 jin per person. They said:

	"It's like a dwarf climbing stairs, stepping up step by step." Take the survey data of the six ethnic group joint cooperatives as an example. These six cooperatives have 2,387 households (including 1,491 households of Miao people). The total output value increased by 40.3% in 1956. 83% of the cooperative members increased their income. The poor peasants increased their income the most, with an average of 15 yuan per person, an increase of 47%; the middle peasants also increased their income quite a bit, with an average of 13 yuan per person, an increase of 33%. Actual life shows that running cooperatives well is a road to common prosperity. The idea of some middle peasants who previously thought that running cooperatives meant the poor peasants were taking advantage of the middle peasants has been dispelled.

Of course, compared with the prospects of the socialist new countryside, this is just a start. Production is still backward, life is still not prosperous, and the economic conditions of poor peasants and lower-middle peasants are still far from those of well-to-do middle peasants. The lives of a small number of households with weak labor and many mouths to feed are still difficult. There are still relatively many difficulties in production and life in some high mountain areas. There is no miracle of ascending to heaven in one step. But in a few years, it is possible to catch up with or exceed the level of well-to-do middle peasants in terms of the production level of cooperatives and the living standards of cooperative members. This can be used as the fighting goal of cooperatives in the next few years.

Because farmers have initially experienced the benefits of cooperatives from their own personal experience, the vast majority of people are satisfied with the cooperatives. But there are also very few people who are not satisfied. Some well-to-do middle peasants, who previously had slight exploitation and particularly good production conditions, and worked less and earned more, believed that the cooperatives were not superior. To give an example, in Renhuai County, the county that produces Maotai liquor, there was a "storm" during the autumn harvest distribution in Huainan Cooperative. Originally, this cooperative was doing quite well, with 89% of the cooperative members increasing their income. But there were still some people who were not satisfied. One well-to-do middle peasant, who used to lend out 8 shi of grain and collect 4 shi of interest, believed that the cooperative was not "superior" to him. The father of a staff member, also a well-to-do middle peasant, had 4 shi of land, which was previously cultivated by his two sons at home. Last year, he joined the cooperative, and everyone actively went to work. He had labor power, and he was embarrassed not to participate (he worked more than 50 workdays throughout the year), but he was unhappy. He said: "If it weren't for my son working, I would have withdrawn from the cooperative." There were also some landlords and rich peasants who were dissatisfied and secretly engaged in demolition activities. One rich peasant, an old Baozhang, said: "The emperor's decree of the Qing Dynasty, Chiang Kai-shek's order, and the Communist Party's policies are all similar." (meaning that running the cooperative is forced). These people stirred up evil winds in the open and in the dark, treating certain shortcomings of the cooperative as pigtails, seizing them and refusing to let go, creating an atmosphere that the cooperative was "terrible." This gust of wind once affected some people. Some households in difficulty were in immediate difficulty and could not see the future clearly, and they hesitated; some people were not used to the new way of life, and they also hesitated. Moreover, this gust of wind was also reflected in the cooperative management committee; a few cooperative cadres wavered, believing that "the superiority is not great, and there are many shortcomings"; but most cooperative cadres believed that the cooperative solved many difficulties in farmers' production and increased production a lot, and the superiority was very great. This caused a debate. Later, under the leadership of the township branch, the members were mobilized to discuss, and the members were asked to put forward the advantages and disadvantages of the cooperative that they personally felt. After seven days, six advantages were summarized, and at the same time, the shortcomings in some specific issues were analyzed, and methods to overcome these shortcomings were studied. Some care was also given to those households in difficulty who had reduced their income due to weak labor or illness. As a result, those who were active became more active, and those who were once negative became active again. Those who said the cooperative was not good were also talking about the superiority of the cooperative, and those who secretly engaged in demolition activities were isolated.

The method of mobilizing the masses to summarize the work of this cooperative is a good experience. The experience of this cooperative and the experience of various places in the province have shown such a problem: that is, why should we fully affirm the achievements? Because this is greatly related to affirming the general direction of cooperativization, strengthening confidence, and protecting the socialist enthusiasm of the masses and cadres. We know that only by constantly mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses and cadres can we run the cooperative well. This was the case last year, and it is no exception this year.

	Progressing from Constantly Solving New Problems and Correcting Shortcomings

Affirming achievements does not mean that we cannot talk about shortcomings. In fact, there are shortcomings. After a high tide, cooperativization was basically realized. How to run so many cooperatives? There are many new problems, how to solve them? There is not much experience. In the spring of last year, the following problems occurred: since the collective economy is superior, it is of course correct to seize the opportunity to run the collective economy, but the family sideline businesses of the cooperative members have not been taken care of, which is a shortcoming; since increasing grain production is the focus, it is also correct to seize the opportunity to increase grain production, but sideline production has also been neglected, which is also a shortcoming; in order to complete the collective production tasks, it is necessary to actively organize the members to go to work, but the time required for members to operate sideline businesses and housework, as well as the time required for ethnic minority customs, have not been guaranteed; it is good to set advanced production plans, but there are also some parts that are too large, and labor quotas have also been too high or too low. It is an achievement to build water conservancy projects and expand the irrigation area by 3.12 million mu, accumulate and manufacture fertilizer, and increase the amount of fertilizer applied by half or one time, but some of the water conservancy projects and fertilizers are of poor quality, which is a shortcoming. There are problems with all of these. In a word, the achievements are great. Otherwise, last year's harvest would have been unimaginable. At the same time, there are also shortcomings. The masses have opinions on these shortcomings. These shortcomings, in the final analysis, involve the interests of all cooperative members, the interests of some cooperative members, or the interests of individual cooperative members. But these shortcomings are often accompanied by achievements, and achievements are the main thing. Therefore, the essence of the masses' opinions is to consolidate achievements, correct shortcomings, and run the cooperative better. At that time, some staff members could not see the shortcomings or did not see them enough. This situation has changed since the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on running cooperatives diligently and thriftily were issued. After several inspections and several rectifications, most of the shortcomings have been corrected, and some that have not been thoroughly corrected are still being corrected. It can be said that paying attention to correcting shortcomings in the movement of progress is one of the reasons why the movement was able to ensure healthy development and achieve great results last year. For example, many cooperatives have corrected the shortcomings of neglecting sideline businesses on the basis of vigorously doing a good job in agriculture, actively carrying out diversified operations, and striving for comprehensive production increases, which is an example. In the second half of the year, another situation appeared, that is, as mentioned earlier, some well-to-do middle peasants seized on certain shortcomings and refused to let go, saying that the cooperatives were not superior. This situation was also reflected in the minds of a few cadres. They did not see enough of the achievements and saw too much of the shortcomings. In a few cooperatives, because the affirmation of achievements was vague and the criticism of shortcomings was excessive, the enthusiasm of some cooperative cadres was affected for a time. When the cooperative cadres relaxed their leadership, the spring plowing preparation work and basic construction in winter production were affected to some extent. This is the new shortcoming that arose after the autumn harvest distribution. After education, this new shortcoming has been corrected. In short, our work is progressing from constantly solving new problems, consolidating the achievements already made, and correcting shortcomings and errors. Cadres and the masses are also gradually tempered, educated, and improved their awareness and increased their talents from practice. It should be said that this year, compared with last year, the conditions for running cooperatives well have not decreased but increased. Now, generally speaking, cooperatives have made great progress compared to last spring in mastering the management policies, arranging collective operation and individual operation, allocating collective labor time and cooperative members' sideline labor, housework, and the time required for ethnic minorities' activities, adjusting labor organization, and production quotas.

I believe that under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, with the active efforts of the vast number of farmers, the cooperatives will definitely be run better in 1957. (Attached picture)

### 巩固成绩纠正缺点  把农业社办得更好　苗春亭说，这是贵州省农民的要求

　　巩固成绩纠正缺点  把农业社办得更好
　　苗春亭说，这是贵州省农民的要求
    我完全拥护毛主席的指示和周总理的报告。现就贵州农业合作化的一些情况，作一粗略发言。
      说到贵州，大家都知道它是一个山区，一个多民族杂居的省份。现在工业还很少。如何领导各族农民办好合作社，发展山区生产，支援国家工业化和改善农民生活，是全省工作中最重要的问题。
    1956年，也就是实现合作化后第一年，可以说是一个丰收年。虽然气候条件并不特别有利，有12个县遭到严重旱灾，粮食总产量仍较1955年增加了11亿多斤，增产幅度在13％以上。工业原料作物大多数也是丰收的，林木特产和畜牧业生产，除毛猪外，也是增产的。这对于支援国家工业建设和改善农民生活，是有一定作用的。从改善农民生活来看，每个农民的平均留粮量就增加了70多斤原粮。现金收入也有增加。根据秋收分配统计，有82％的社员增加了收入（冬季副业生产收入，未计算在内）。实际生活证明了合作社的优越性。
    虽不能一步登天，却是在步步登高
    农民已经可以从亲身体验中来体会合作社的好处了。以炉山县多壋为例。这个小寨子，住着13户少数民族农民。他们在1954年是互助组，每人平均收入39.7元，留粮量480斤；1955年是初级社，每人收入46.1元，留粮量540斤；1956年是高级社，每人收入54.8元，留粮量553斤。他们说：
  “好比矮子上楼梯，步步登高。”又以六个民族联合社的调查材料为例。这六个社，有2，387户。（其中苗族有1，491户）1956年总产值增加了40.3％。83％的社员增加了收入。贫农增加收入最多，每人平均15元，增加幅度为47％；中农增加收入也不算少，每人平均13元，增加幅度为33％。实际生活说明，办好合作社是一条共同富裕的道路。部分中农，以前认为办合作社就是贫农沾中农的光的想法打消了。
    当然，与社会主义新农村的远景相比较，这只不过是开步走而已。现在生产仍然落后，生活仍不富裕，贫农，下中农的经济状况与富裕中农还有距离。少数劳动力弱、吃饭人口多的农户生活仍然困难。一部分高山地区，生产和生活上的困难还比较多。一步登天的奇迹是没有的。但在几年内，把合作社的生产水平和社员们的生活水平，赶上或超过富裕中农的水平，是可能的。这可以作为合作社最近几年的斗争目标。
    由于农民已经初步从亲身经验中体会到合作社的好处，所以绝大多数人对合作社是满意的。但也有极少数的人不满意。有一部分富裕中农，以前有轻微剥削，生产条件特别好，出工少，收入多，就认为合作社不优越。举一个例子，出茅台酒的那个县——仁怀县，有个怀南合作社，在秋收分配时，曾发生了“一场风波”。本来，这个合作社办得并不错，有89％的社员增加了收入。但是仍有人不满意。有一个富裕中农，过去放债8石粮食，收利息4石，认为合作社对他“不优越”。一个工作人员的父亲，也是一个富裕中农，有4石田，过去由在家的两个儿子代耕。去年入了社，大家都积极出工，他有劳动力，不好意思不参加，（全年出工50多个劳动日）但是心里不高兴，他说：“要不是我儿子参加工作，我非得退社不可”。还有一些地主、富农，心怀不满，暗中进行拆台活动。有个富农，老保长，他说：“满清的圣旨，蒋介石的命令，共产党的政策都是差不多的”。（意思是说，办社是强迫的）。这些人在明处暗处刮歪风，把合作社的某些缺点当作小辫子，抓住不放，制造合作社“糟得很”的空气。这阵风曾经影响了一部分人。有的困难户，眼前困难，对前途看不清楚，发生犹豫；有的人对新生活方式不习惯，也发生犹豫，并且，这阵风也曾经反映到社管会里来；有个别社干部发生了动摇，认为“优越性不大，缺点不少”；但大部分社干部认为合作社解决了农民生产上许多困难，增产很多，优越性很大。于是引起争论。后来，在乡支部领导下，发动社员讨论，让社员提出自己亲身感觉到的社的好处和缺点，经过七天，总结出六条好处，同时，也分析了在某些具体问题上的缺点，并且研究了克服这些缺点的办法。对那些因劳动力弱，或者害病而减少收入的困难户又作了一些照顾。于是，积极的更加积极，一度消极的又积极起来了。说合作社不好的也在讲合作社的优越性了，暗中进行拆台活动的孤立了。
  这个社发动群众总结工作的办法是一个好的经验。这个社的经验和全省各地的经验，都说明了这样一个问题：就是为什么要充分肯定成绩？因为这对于肯定合作化这个大方向，坚定信心，保护群众和干部的社会主义积极性是大有关系的。我们知道，只有不断调动群众和干部的积极性，才可能办好合作社。去年是这样，今年也不例外。
    从不断解决新问题和纠正缺点中前进
    肯定成绩不等于可以不谈缺点。事实上，缺点是有的。一个高潮，基本上实现了合作化，那么多的合作社，如何办呢？新问题很多，如何解决呢？并没有多少经验。在去年春天，这样一些问题发生了：既然集体经济优越，于是就抓紧办集体经济，这当然是正确的，但是，对社员家庭副业曾经缺乏照顾，这就是缺点；既然增产粮食是重点，于是就抓紧粮食生产，这也是正确的，但是，对副业生产也曾经有所忽视，这也是缺点；为着完成集体生产任务，就要积极组织社员出工，但是社员经营副业与家务劳动所需要的时间以及少数民族风俗习惯所需要的时间，也没有得到保证；生产计划定得先进是好的，但也有偏大的部分，劳动定额，也发生过偏高偏低的现象。兴修水利，扩大灌溉面积312万亩，积制肥料，施肥量增加半倍或一倍，这都是成绩，但是，其中有小部分水利工程、肥料，质量不好，这就是缺点。诸如此类，都有问题。一句话，成绩很大。否则，去年的丰收是不可想像的。同时，缺点也有。群众对于这些缺点是有意见的。这些缺点，归根结蒂是涉及到全体社员的利益，部分社员的利益，或者是个别社员的利益。但这些缺点往往是伴随着成绩出现的，成绩又是主要的。因此，群众意见的实质，是要求巩固成绩，纠正缺点，把社办得更好些。当时，有些工作人员，对缺点看不见或看得不够。这种情况自从中共中央和国务院关于勤俭办社的指示下达后，就变化了。经过几次检查、几次整顿，大部分缺点已经得到纠正，有些纠正得不彻底的，现还在继续纠正。可以说，由于在前进运动中注意了纠正缺点，正是去年所以能够保证运动健康发展，获得很大成绩的原因之一。比如有不少合作社，在大力搞好农业的基础上，纠正了忽视副业的缺点，积极开展多种经营，争得了全面增产，就是例证。到了下半年，又出现了另一种情况，就是前边说的，有些富裕中农抓住某些缺点不放，说合作社不优越。这种情况也反映到少数干部的头脑中来了。对成绩看得不够，对缺点看得过分。有少数社，因为肯定成绩含糊，批评缺点过分，一度影响了部分社干部的积极性。社干部领导一放松，冬季生产中的春耕准备工作和基本建设就受到了一些影响。这就是在秋收分配以后产生的新的缺点。经过教育，这种新的缺点已经得到了纠正。总之，我们的工作正是从不断解决新问题，巩固既得成绩，纠正缺点和错误当中前进的。干部和群众也正是从实践中，逐步受到锻炼、受到教育，提高觉悟和增长才干的。应当说，今年比起去年，办好合作社的条件，不是减少而是增加了。现在，一般说来，合作社在掌握经营方针、安排集体经营与个人经营、分配集体劳动时间与社员副业劳动、家务劳动以及少数民族所需要的活动时间、调整劳动组织和生产定额等方面，都比去年春天有了很大的进步。
    我相信，在中共中央和国务院的正确领导下，在广大农民的积极努力下，在1957年，合作社一定会办得更好。（附图片）
