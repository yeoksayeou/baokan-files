　　Reactions to Criticism
    The Chinese medicine procurement and wholesale station of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Taikang County, Henan Province, wrote: We sincerely accept the criticism published in the People's Daily on February 16, "Tens of Thousands of Catties of Medicinal Materials Have Molded," and have inspected and improved our work. After taking remedial measures, three-quarters of the medicinal materials are still effective, but 7,432 catties are completely ineffective, with a loss of 900 yuan and 4 jiao and 8 fen.
    In the future, we will learn from this lesson and prevent such incidents from happening again.

　　对批评的反应
    河南省太康县供销合作社中药材采购批发站来信：我们诚恳地接受人民日报2月16日发表的“几万斤药材霉烂了”的批评，并已检查改进工作。经采取挽救措施后，有四分之三的药材还有效，但仍有七千四百三十二斤全部失效，损失款达九百元零四角八分。
    今后，我们要接受这一教训，杜绝这类事件的发生。
