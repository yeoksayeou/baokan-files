　　Soviet Union Vigorously Develops Kursk Iron Mine
　  First Gas Turbine Power Station Soon to be Completed
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 24th: The Soviet Union is vigorously developing the world-renowned Kursk-Belgorod Magnetic Anomaly iron ore region, preparing to build it into the largest iron ore production area near the Moscow industrial region.

    Now, a new miners' city has sprung up in this mining area. A huge mining complex has been built in the city center. Two open-pit mines, each with an annual production capacity of several million tons of iron ore, are currently under construction in northern Belgorod.

    Long-term exploration results have proven that this large mining area contains 200 billion tons of iron ore. According to current global demand for pig iron and steel, the iron ore in this mining area, once fully developed, will be able to meet human needs for two centuries.

    This large mining area stretches from southeast to northwest, almost 500 kilometers long, with a mining area of 10,000 square kilometers, almost including the entire area of the Kursk and Belgorod regions of the Russian Federation. The iron content of the ore in some places reaches 66%.

    The reserves in a single mining area in the village of Yakovlevo exceed the reserves of the famous Magnitnaya Mountain deposit by two times (the Soviet Union's largest Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine was built on the basis of the Magnitnaya Mountain deposit). In a mining area near the village of Gostishchevo, the ore layer is 200 meters thick. No other mining area in the world can compare with it in terms of iron ore reserves.

    The discovery of the resources in this area dates back more than a century. At that time, people believed that mining there would be economically unprofitable. Planned research and development of this mining area began during the Soviet era.

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 24th: The Soviet Union's first gas turbine power station is about to be completed in the Tula region.

    The turbine in this power station will be powered by gas obtained from burning ordinary coal. Unlike ordinary power stations, the coal is burned underground instead of in a furnace.

    The Soviet Union already had some power stations converted to gas power generation last year. Using gas for power generation can save a large amount of coal and heavy oil, and can also reduce the building volume of power stations.

    The complete set of equipment for the power station will be installed in one machine room, and the entire power generation process will be automated. The temperature of the gas is about 650 degrees Celsius. The gas is forced into the turbine blades under tremendous pressure. The coefficient of this new type of power station is 27%, which is much higher than that of ordinary thermal power stations.

### 苏联大力开发库尔斯克铁矿  第一座煤气涡轮机发电站即将建成

　　苏联大力开发库尔斯克铁矿
　  第一座煤气涡轮机发电站即将建成
    新华社莫斯科24日电　苏联正在大力开发世界著名的库尔斯克—别尔哥罗德地磁异常区的铁矿，准备把它建设成为莫斯科工业区附近最大的铁矿产地。
    现在，一个新矿工城已经在这个矿区兴起。在城市的中心，建成了一个巨大的采矿联合企业。在别尔哥罗德北部，目前正在建设两个每年可产几百万吨铁矿砂的露天矿场。
    长期勘查结果证明，这个大矿区蕴藏的铁矿有两千亿吨。根据目前世界对生铁和钢的需要量估算，这个矿区的铁矿经充分开发后，将可以满足人类两世纪的需要。
    这个大矿区的矿床从东南伸展到西北，全长几乎有五百公里，矿床面积有一万平方公里，几乎包括了俄罗斯联邦库尔斯克和别尔哥罗德这两个州的全部地区。有些地方的矿砂含铁量达到66％。
    单是亚科夫列沃村地区的一个矿区，它的蕴藏量就超过著名的马格尼特山矿床的蕴藏量的两倍（苏联最大的马格尼托哥尔斯克冶金联合企业就是建立在马格尼特山矿床的基础上）。在位于戈斯集谢沃村附近的一个矿区，矿层厚度达二百公尺，就铁矿蕴藏量来说世界上没有任何一个矿区能够同它相比。
    发现这个地区的富源已经是一百多年的事情了。那时人们认为在那里进行开采在经济上是无利可图的。对这个矿区开始作有计划的研究和开发还是苏维埃年代的事。
    新华社莫斯科24日电　苏联第一座煤气涡轮机发电站即将在图拉州建成。
    这座发电站的涡轮机将用燃烧普通煤所得到的煤气来发动。和一般发电站不同的是：煤不是在炉子里而是在地下燃烧的。
    苏联在去年就已经有一些发电站改用煤气发电。用煤气发电可以节省大量煤和重油，并且可以使发电站的建筑体积缩小。
    发电站的全套装备将安装在一个机器间里，整个发电过程将是自动化的。煤气的温度约为摄氏六百五十度。煤气在巨大的压力下被压到涡轮机的叶片中间。这种新的发电站的系数为27％，比普通的热电站高得多。
