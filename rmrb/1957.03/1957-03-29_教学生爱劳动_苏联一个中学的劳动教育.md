Teaching Students to Love Labor
　　——Labor Education at a Soviet Middle School——
　　The Vitluzhsky Middle School is located in a worker's village 120 kilometers from Gorky City, USSR. There are many factories here, as well as two collective farms.

　　In the past five years, Vitluzhsky Middle School has built many houses and facilities for labor education, such as teaching factories, mechanical teaching rooms, and garages. The students actively participated in these construction projects. With the help of local enterprises, the middle school obtained three cars, a tractor, and several lathes, and also built a small power station.

　　The teachers try their best to enable students to apply the knowledge they learn from books to life, and to consolidate their knowledge through practice and visits. For example, the school often organizes visits. When the students visit a wood processing factory, they see how to measure and calculate. After returning to school, they calculate how much wood is needed to build an assembled house. When eighth-grade students learn about Newton's laws, the teachers let them make some experimental equipment themselves to prove the physical meaning of these laws. The school also trains students to be workers through teaching factories. In this small factory, the students make many test tube racks, calorimeters, and simple tools.

　　The extracurricular activities of this middle school play an important role in labor education. Now the school has extracurricular groups such as automobile, motorcycle, handicraft, beekeeping, photography, housework, and chorus. Many students who participated in the automobile group are now able to drive cars independently. Last summer, students in this group used the opportunity to repair the school's cars to study the structure of various parts of the car. Students participating in the motor group made a small telephone switchboard, installed radio broadcasting points in each class, and installed electric bells in the aisles. In addition, they also made antennas for receiving television broadcasts. Each group publishes wall newspapers regularly, such as "Young Physicist," "Young Michurin," and "Handyman."

　　Vitluzhsky Middle School often holds exhibitions to display the things made by various extracurricular groups. Last autumn, the school held a crop exhibition, and the exhibits were all cultivated by the students in the school's garden. The school's apiary, orchard, and garden are the places that students are most interested in and care about.

　　Every summer, the students of this middle school go to the collective farm with great pleasure to help with weeding, harvesting crops, and doing other farm work.

　　What level will the graduates of Vitluzhsky Middle School have? -- They can understand technical drawings, operate according to the drawings, they can drive cars, master the basic knowledge of motor technology, and they can also do all kinds of farm work.

　　The concrete manifestation of the achievements of Vitluzhsky Middle School in labor education is that students love labor. Many graduates of the school are now working well in factories and collective farms. For example, Viltekin, a graduate of this school, is now the foreman of a workshop in a wood processing factory; Kachachikova has become an advanced milkmaid in the Michurin Collective Farm.

　　教学生爱劳动
　　——苏联一个中学的劳动教育——
    维特卢日斯基中学设在距苏联高尔基城一百二十公里的一个工人村里。这里有很多工厂，还有两个集体农庄。
    最近五年来，维特卢日斯基中学修建了不少进行劳动教育的房屋设备，如教学工厂、机械学教学室、车库等。学生们都积极参加了这些建设工作。在当地企业的帮助下，这个中学得到了三辆汽车、一架拖拉机和好几台车床，而且还建筑了一个小发电站。
    教员们努力设法使学生把从书本上得来的知识用到生活中去，使他们通过实习和参观巩固自己的知识。例如，学校经常组织参观，当学生们到木材加工工厂参观的时候，看到了怎样测量和计算，回校后他们就自己计算盖一幢装配式的住宅需要多少木材。八年级的学生学到牛顿诸定律的时候，教员让他们自己作一些实验用具来证明这些定律的物理意义。学校还通过教学工厂培养学生当工人，在这个小工厂里学生们作出了很多试验管架、量热器和简单的工具。
    这个中学的学生课外活动在劳动教育中占有重要地位。现在学校里有汽车、摩托车、手工、养蜂、摄影、家务、合唱等课外小组。参加汽车小组的很多学生现在已经能够独自驾驶汽车了。去年夏天，这个小组的学生利用修理学校的汽车的机会研究了汽车各部分的构造。参加电机小组的学生做了一个小型电话总机，在各个班里安设了无线电广播点，在过道里安装了电铃。此外，他们还做好了接收电视放映的天线。各小组定期出墙报，如“少年物理学家”、“少年米丘林”、“能手”等。
    维特卢日斯基中学时常举行展览会，展出各个课外小组做出的东西。去年秋天，学校举办了一次农作物展览会，展品都是学生们在学校的园地里培植出来的。学校的养蜂场、果园、花园是学生们最感兴趣、最关心的地方。
    每年夏天，这个中学的学生都怀着非常愉快的心情到集体农庄去帮助除草、收割庄稼和做一些其他庄稼活。
    维特卢日斯基中学的毕业生将具备什么样的水平呢？——能看懂技术草图，能按照草图进行操作，他们会开汽车，掌握了电机技术的基础知识，还会干各种庄稼活。
    维特卢日斯基中学进行劳动教育的成绩的具体表现，就是学生们热爱劳动。学校的很多毕业生现在在工厂和集体农庄里工作得很好。例如，这个学校的毕业生维尔特金现在当了木材加工工厂的车间工长；卡查奇科娃成了米丘林集体农庄的先进挤奶员。
