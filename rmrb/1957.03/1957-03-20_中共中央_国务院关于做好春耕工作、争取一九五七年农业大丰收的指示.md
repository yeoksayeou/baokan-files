    "Do everything possible to strive for a great agricultural harvest in 1957" should become the central slogan and goal of struggle on the agricultural production front. – This year's agricultural production has more favorable conditions than any previous year. As long as we are good at utilizing all favorable conditions and at correcting errors and shortcomings in our work, the task of striving for a great harvest this year can be achieved. – Strengthen the management of agricultural cooperatives and run them well, based on the principles of diligence and thrift in running cooperatives and democratic management of cooperatives. – Strengthen field management of wheat, rapeseed, and other crops, strive for a great harvest of spring and summer crops, and do a good job in spring planting; promote yield-increasing technical measures according to local conditions to increase yield per unit area. – Implement the policy of prioritizing the development of grain production while developing cotton and various cash crops and developing diversified economies. – Pay special attention to strengthening production leadership in disaster areas, mountainous areas, and low-yield areas. – Do a good job in supplying agricultural production materials and purchasing agricultural products, and do a good job in agricultural loans and other economic work. – Request that Party committees at all levels strengthen leadership, select a group of capable cadres, go deep into the villages and agricultural cooperatives, and launch a deeper, more solid, and healthier great production movement.

    I

    1957 is the second year of realizing overall agricultural cooperativization in our country and the final year of our country's first Five-Year Plan. Striving for a great agricultural harvest in 1957 is of particularly important significance for the consolidation of the socialist agricultural cooperativization system and for the development of socialist economic construction. In 1956, on the basis of realizing agricultural cooperativization nationwide, we overcame serious natural disasters. The output of various major crops (except cotton) increased significantly compared to the bumper year of 1955. The majority of cooperatives increased production, and the majority of members increased income, which has clearly demonstrated the superiority of socialist agriculture. Realizing a great agricultural harvest in 1957 will enable more members to increase more income, and will correspondingly increase farmers' rations and feed, thereby more fully exerting the superiority of socialist agriculture and further consolidating the socialist agricultural economic system. At the same time, realizing a great agricultural harvest in 1957 will provide more grain and non-staple food to supply cities, and more industrial raw materials to supply industry, thereby guaranteeing the supply of industrial products to cities and rural areas, further increasing farmers' purchasing power, expanding the sales market for industrial products in rural areas, and increasing socialist accumulation; and can increase export goods, exchange for more industrial equipment, and more powerfully support industrial construction. Realizing a great agricultural harvest in 1957, fully completing and exceeding the first Five-Year Plan, will enable our country to enter the second Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy under more favorable conditions. Therefore, "Do everything possible to strive for a great agricultural harvest in 1957" should become the central slogan and goal of struggle on the agricultural production front.

    II

    This year's agricultural production has more favorable conditions than any previous year.

    First, advanced forms of agricultural cooperativization have been basically realized nationwide, which is the most fundamental favorable condition for developing agricultural production. This is clearly different from the situation last spring when we were both busy with spring farming production and busy with expanding cooperatives, merging cooperatives, and transforming elementary cooperatives into advanced cooperatives, a "busy on both ends" situation.

    Second, this year's spring farming production started much earlier and is much better prepared than last year. Many places are carrying out preparatory work intensely, and some places have already launched a spring farming production upsurge.

    Third, cadres at all levels and the broad masses of farmers have gained considerable experience and lessons in last year's agricultural cooperativization upsurge and agricultural production upsurge, and can run agricultural cooperatives better than last year and do agricultural production work better than last year.

    Fourth, the large-scale farmland capital construction carried out last year, such as small-scale water conservancy, land consolidation, soil improvement, etc., will only fully发挥效益 this year. In addition, continuing to build farmland water conservancy this year will undoubtedly bring more farmland water conservancy benefits to this year's agricultural production than last year.

    Fifth, the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives have prepared a certain amount of seeds, fertilizers, fodder, and necessary working capital. Although some cooperatives are still not adequately prepared, this is completely different from the situation during last year's spring farming season, when the vast majority of cooperatives had just been established, seeds and fodder were temporarily collected, and production funds were very difficult.

    Sixth, the state continues to support agricultural cooperatives financially, economically, and technically, and supports agricultural production. In particular, the purchase prices of certain agricultural products (such as pigs and certain oil crops) have been significantly increased, which is very beneficial for developing the production of these agricultural products.

    On the other hand, the management level and experience of the majority of agricultural cooperative cadres at present are not yet fully adapted to the requirements of large-scale production after cooperativization; some low-yield areas and low-yield agricultural cooperatives have not yet found reliable ways to increase crop yields, nor have they found ways to develop diversified operations; and areas that suffered severe disasters in 1956 still have certain difficulties in restoring and developing production. However, all these difficulties are difficulties in progress, and can be completely overcome by relying on the collective strength of the cooperatives. It is much easier to overcome these difficulties than in the era of individual management in the past. Therefore, as long as we make redoubled efforts, are good at utilizing all favorable conditions, and are good at correcting errors and shortcomings in our work, the task of striving for a great agricultural harvest in 1957 under normal weather conditions can certainly be achieved.

    III

    In order to realize a great agricultural harvest in 1957, we must first strengthen the management of agricultural cooperatives and run them well, based on the principles of diligence and thrift in running cooperatives and democratic management of cooperatives. The CCP Central Committee and the State Council have issued special instructions on this issue in April, September, and November of 1956, and the CCP Central Committee recently issued a notice on several matters concerning democratic management of cooperatives, which should continue to be earnestly implemented everywhere.

    Spring farming has already begun in some areas, and it will begin soon in other places. In order to enable farmers to devote themselves fully to spring farming production, a small number of agricultural cooperatives that have not yet settled their income distribution for the previous year should seize the time and quickly settle them clearly, without delaying spring farming; the work of merging cooperatives and transforming them into advanced cooperatives should be temporarily suspended, and the work of dividing overly large cooperatives into smaller ones should also generally be temporarily suspended. If some overly large cooperatives do have many problems and changing them would indeed affect spring farming production, some necessary and appropriate adjustments can be made in a simple manner based on the specific situation of the local cooperative and the opinions of the majority of members. For example, some can adopt a joint cooperative method, where production within the cooperative, except for the parts that must be managed uniformly by the joint cooperative, is independently managed by each branch cooperative, which is responsible for its own profits and losses; or, depending on the different situations of various productions, some can be managed uniformly by the entire cooperative and distributed uniformly, while others can be independently managed by each production team, which is responsible for its own profits and losses; or the proportion of over-production rewards can be increased to take care of production teams with more increased production. These various intermediate forms can be studied and tested according to the situation when resolving disputes in large cooperatives, and uniformity should not be forced.

    In terms of the implementation of mutual benefit policies, some cooperatives still have some outstanding issues, such as unreasonable pricing of production materials when joining the cooperative, and all scattered trees (mainly fruit trees) and scattered livestock (mainly sheep) that could have not joined the cooperative were all made to join, causing dissatisfaction among some members. These outstanding issues should be resolved quickly and reasonably in accordance with the previous instructions of the Central Committee and the State Council, in order to facilitate spring farming production. On the other hand, recently in some places, it has been found that some well-to-do middle peasant members, seeing that the market price of mules and horses has risen recently and feeling that operating commercial transportation can make a large profit after the opening of the free market, have found various excuses to forcibly pull back mules and horses that had long been priced and joined the cooperative and belonged to the public, affecting the production of the entire cooperative, especially the current spring farming production. This behavior of some well-to-do middle peasants is obviously wrong and should be persuaded and educated to be stopped.

    In addition, according to recent reports, some agricultural cooperatives have not yet formulated their 1957 production plans and must formulate them quickly. There are also places and agricultural cooperatives that, after criticizing the excessively high 1956 production plans, showed an overly conservative tendency when formulating the 1957 production plans, setting this year's planned output lower than last year's actual output. Agricultural production plans should be fully reliable, but at the same time they must be active and mobilizing, neither blindly seeking high targets nor opposing conservative sentiments. At the same time, it is entirely necessary to continue to overcome the problem of excessive control in the formulation of agricultural production plans in order to promote a certain degree of independence in the production and operation of agricultural cooperatives under the guidance of state plans. However, according to reports, some places have shown a phenomenon of letting things take their own course, so that some cooperatives only pay attention to local and temporary interests, doing whatever makes more money, deviating from the guidance of state plans and not considering the needs of members for food. This tendency should also be prevented.

    In all the management work of agricultural cooperatives, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the mass line, consult with members on everything, establish and improve the system of member representative conferences, and rely on the broad masses of members to run the cooperatives well, thereby promoting the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of members and developing agricultural production.

    IV

    In order to realize a great agricultural harvest in 1957, it is necessary to strengthen field management of crops such as wheat and rapeseed, first strive for a great harvest of spring and summer crops; it is necessary to do a good job in the current spring planting work; and it is necessary to rely on the collective strength of the cooperatives, continue to work actively, and promote various effective yield-increasing technical measures according to local conditions to increase yield per unit area.

    In 1956, in terms of building water conservancy, accumulating fertilizer, promoting improved varieties, improving soil, promoting new farm tools, changing cropping systems, improving cultivation techniques, and preventing and controlling diseases, pests, and disasters, unprecedentedly broad mass-based scale was achieved, and extremely great achievements were made, not only greatly exceeding any previous year, but some yield-increasing measures were even greater than the cumulative achievements of several years since liberation. Ignoring the overall achievements, exaggerating local shortcomings and errors, and adopting a passive attitude in promoting yield-increasing technical measures is wrong and very harmful to striving for a great agricultural harvest in 1957. However, it should also be pointed out that about 15% of the yield-increasing measures promoted last year had shortcomings and need to be improved; and a few percent were done wrong, resulting in reduced production or other economic losses. These shortcomings and errors must also be carefully summarized, drawn as lessons, and not repeated.

    First, it is necessary to continue to increase the multiple cropping index and expand the area of double-cropping rice. However, when carrying out these measures, it is necessary to fully consider the amount of water and fertilizer, the length of the local climate season, whether labor and working hours can keep up, and whether the maturity period of early and late rice varieties is appropriate, etc., and not make excessive demands regardless of these conditions.

    Second, corn and potatoes are high-yielding in general dryland areas and should be appropriately increased, especially in food-deficient areas, where their planting should be actively promoted. However, in places where millet and sorghum are high-yielding and farmers already have cultivation experience and eating habits, do not blindly switch to corn and potatoes. At the same time, when formulating the current spring planting plan and increasing the planting of corn and potatoes, it is also necessary to comprehensively plan for the fodder, fuel, and living habits needed by local and cooperative farmers. Appropriate arrangements should also be made for the small miscellaneous grains that people are accustomed to eating, and do not lose sight of one thing while attending to another.

    Third, the work of cultivating and promoting improved varieties must be strengthened. Improved varieties of various crops should be vigorously and actively promoted in places where they have been proven suitable for planting. For newly introduced varieties, trial planting must be carried out first, and then promoted after success. If the results of the trial planting are difficult to confirm for the time being, trial planting should continue, and do not rush to promote them. For the seeds needed for the current spring planting, it is necessary to conduct practical inspection and fine selection, and adjust and supply them in a timely manner according to the surplus and deficiency situation; at the same time, a portion of seeds for replanting and disaster relief should be stored to meet unexpected needs.

    Fourth, new farm tools should continue to be promoted in applicable places, and efforts should be made to do a good job in technical instruction and farm tool repair and parts supply before and during spring farming. The issue of double-铧犁下水田 should continue to be studied and tested. All places where the experiment has not been successful should not blindly promote it. Double-铧犁 that have been sold, are indeed not suitable, and that farmers request to return should be recovered as soon as possible.

    Fifth, before spring farming begins and after spring farming ends, advantage should be taken of the slack season to actively build new water conservancy projects, repair and improve projects built in the past, strive to expand the irrigated area, and combine with irrigation channels and land leveling projects, so that the water conservancy projects built can fully exert their due benefits. When planning these projects, a view of drought prevention and flood control should also be considered.

    Sixth, on the basis of the winter fertilizer accumulation movement, regular fertilizer accumulation work should be carried out, accumulating manure fertilizer, picking up dung fertilizer, composting green manure, burning ash fertilizer, and collecting urban manure and miscellaneous fertilizer, and fully utilizing all available fertilizer sources of human and animal waste and other usable fertilizers to ensure the base fertilizer for spring planting and the top dressing for crops. Chemical fertilizers and cake fertilizers and other commercial fertilizers must also be supplied in a timely manner according to the fertilizer demand season. The remuneration for members' family fertilizer accumulation must be fair and reasonable. Cooperatives with conditions can adopt the method of periodically paying part of the cash and purchasing manure accumulated by members' families, which is the most effective way to encourage members' family fertilizer accumulation and an appropriate way to solve members' pocket money.

    Seventh, all advanced experiences in improving cultivation techniques and preventing and controlling diseases, pests, and disasters should continue to be promoted in applicable areas. And we must be good at organizing agricultural scientific research personnel, agricultural experts from all aspects, and the strength of agricultural technology extension stations, so that they can work from a scientific and technological perspective to strive for the realization of a great agricultural harvest in 1957.

    When promoting various agricultural yield-increasing measures, a positive and locally appropriate approach must be adopted, and the working method of the mass line must also be implemented, actively publicizing and introducing advanced things, and the agricultural cooperatives should decide on adoption or rejection based on their own specific conditions and after democratic discussion. Any subjectivist and commandist practices must be prevented and corrected.

    V

    To achieve a great agricultural harvest in 1957, we must implement the policy of prioritizing the development of grain production while developing cotton and various cash crops and developing diversified economies. Not only is a bumper harvest of grain required, but also a bumper harvest of cotton and other various cash crops, and also a great development of animal husbandry, forestry, fishery, and various other sideline production in rural areas. Not only is it required that the production of agricultural cooperatives be greatly increased, but also that the production of state-owned agricultural (livestock, forestry, fishery) enterprises be greatly increased.

    In animal husbandry, the livestock in pastoral areas has been increasing year by year, and the draft animals in agricultural areas in most provinces have also been increasing. However, in a few provinces, mainly in several provinces in Northeast and North China, the physical strength of draft animals has weakened, the reproduction rate has declined, the mortality rate has increased, and the number of animals has decreased within the two years of 1955 and 1956. This situation poses a serious threat to agricultural production in these places. In accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee and the State Council on the issue of draft animals, in conjunction with the current spring farming production, we should seriously discuss and study with the members and take some effective and specific measures based on the opinions of the majority of members to quickly reverse the situation of draft animals being thin and dying. The purchase price of live pigs has been increased, and various places should seize this favorable condition, mobilize agricultural cooperatives and member families to raise more pigs and accumulate more fertilizer, which is beneficial for increasing meat supply, developing agricultural production, and increasing members' income. Sheep can also be developed in agricultural areas, especially in mountainous and grassy areas, which are more conducive to raising more sheep. Poultry farming should also be developed in a planned manner. Whether in pastoral or agricultural areas, breeding and reproduction work and veterinary epidemic prevention work should be strengthened, and female animals, pregnant animals, and young animals should be protected to increase the reproduction rate of livestock and reduce the mortality rate, so that the number of livestock can be greatly increased. And it is necessary to strengthen the breed improvement of livestock, cultivate strong and large draft animals to meet the needs of large-scale production after agricultural cooperativization; cultivate dairy cows with high milk production, chickens and ducks with high egg production, and livestock and poultry with high meat production, and develop fine-wool sheep to meet the needs of meat and milk supply and industrial development.

    The current season is the spring afforestation season, and the tree planting and afforestation movement should be actively carried out in a planned manner without delaying spring farming production. In areas with conditions, large-scale afforestation should be carried out to maintain soil and water, regulate the climate, and strive to achieve greening of housesides, villagesides, roadsides, and watersides. In tree planting and afforestation, attention should be paid to cultivating more fruit trees and orchards to open up sources of extra income for farmers. At the same time, we should always pay attention to forest protection and prevent forest fires.

    We must actively develop fishery production, do a good job in marine spring fishing season, and make full use of rivers, canals, lakes, and swamps to develop freshwater fisheries.

    Various sideline productions in rural areas should also be actively developed according to the conditions of raw materials and sales to increase the income of cooperatives and members. Credit departments can support the need for working capital of agricultural cooperatives before the agricultural harvest season.

    All state-owned agricultural (livestock, forestry, fishery) enterprises should actively improve management, improve production technology, streamline non-production personnel, increase production, save costs, and truly exert their due demonstration role and technical guidance role.

    VI

    To achieve a great agricultural harvest in 1957, we must also pay special attention to strengthening production leadership in disaster areas, mountainous areas, and low-yield areas.

    The disaster situation was relatively serious in 1956, and the disaster-stricken area was relatively wide. Thanks to the state's relief and support and relying on the collective strength of the cooperatives, the lives of the disaster victims and the restoration of production in the disaster areas have generally been properly arranged. However, relief work cannot still be ignored. Some disaster areas still have certain difficulties in seeds, farm tools, draft animals, fodder, and feed during the current spring farming season, and attention must be paid to inspection and help to solve them; special attention must be paid to relief work during the period of grain shortage, and spring famine must be prevented. Low-lying areas prone to waterlogging disasters should, based on the experience that the rainy season is mostly between July and August, first strive for a bumper harvest of wheat and other early-maturing crops, and autumn crops should use flood-resistant varieties to avoid and reduce waterlogging disasters. Conversely, areas prone to drought disasters should actively build water conservancy projects, expand the irrigated area, and actively study and promote drought-resistant crops, drought-resistant varieties, and drought-resistant cultivation techniques to avoid and reduce the loss of drought disasters.

    Mountainous areas account for a large proportion of the country. In some mountainous areas, the yield per unit area is very low, sideline production is not developed, transportation is extremely inconvenient, there are more difficulties in developing production, and people's lives are relatively poor. However, the potential for developing production in mountainous areas is very great. We should formulate long-term plans for developing production in mountainous areas according to the characteristics of the local area, combine with the requirements of soil and water conservation, and develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and other sideline productions step by step. And gradually improve the transportation roads in mountainous areas, strengthen the purchase and sales of mountainous products, and support the development of production in mountainous areas. There are also some mountainous areas that are old revolutionary base areas during the past revolutionary war period, which have suffered many enemy sweeps and destructions, and the people have suffered great losses, so it is more difficult to restore and develop production than in general mountainous areas. The state has given a lot of care to these old base areas in the past, and should continue to give them care in the future. In the face of the current difficulties in spring farming, we should give strong support. In developing production in impoverished mountainous areas where ethnic minorities live, we must pay special attention to their ethnic interests.

    Low-yield areas and low-yield fields in high-yield areas still account for a large proportion of the country's cultivated land area. Turning low-yield into high-yield is an important link in increasing agricultural production. In recent years, a lot of good experiences have been created, which should be scientifically summarized and promoted. Each low-yield area and place with low-yield fields should, based on local characteristics and with reference to the experience of other areas becoming high-yield, find the key to improving local yields, formulate specific and feasible measures and plans, and gradually realize them.

    VII

    Doing a good job in the supply of agricultural production materials and the purchase of agricultural products, and doing a good job in agricultural loans and other economic work are very important for the development of agricultural production at any time. After agricultural cooperativization, individual small-scale peasant production has become large-scale collective production, and the importance of the above work is even more obvious. In 1956, the high degree of enthusiasm for supporting cooperativization was indeed shown in supply and marketing work, agricultural loan work, etc., and significant results were achieved in promoting cooperativization and increasing production. This year is the second year of realizing agricultural cooperativization, and agricultural production cooperatives still urgently need continued support from all parties. This year's agricultural production task is very arduous, and the relevant economic departments also urgently need to continue to support it. In this regard, any slackening is wrong. The National Bank must further improve the issuance of agricultural loans and the recovery of due agricultural loans, and combine agricultural loans with pre-purchase deposits to better play the role of supporting production. Supply and marketing cooperatives and other relevant departments, in terms of the supply of commercial fertilizers, farm tools, pesticides, agricultural machinery, and water lifting equipment, should understand the different seasons and different needs of each region, make planned arrangements, and ensure that they are supplied to agricultural cooperatives in time for the needs of the season; but attention must be paid to preventing cooperatives from being mechanically required to purchase goods according to plans and contracts, especially pesticides, agricultural machinery, and top dressing needed after disasters. We should also actively open up sources of goods, especially sources of commercial fertilizers, and increase the supply to meet the needs of increased fertilizer consumption after agricultural cooperativization. The adjustment and transportation of draft animals should also be quickly restored.

    VIII

    The busy spring farming activities have already begun in the south, and the northern land is about to thaw, and the spring farming season will soon arrive. Agricultural production is the center of all rural work. It is required that Party and government at all levels strengthen leadership, and in conjunction with the streamlining of organs, enrich the lower levels, select a group of capable cadres, go deep into the villages, go deep into the agricultural cooperatives, and work with all farmers to actively act, launch a deeper, more solid, and healthier great agricultural production movement, and do everything possible to strive for the realization of a great agricultural harvest in 1957.

    中共中央　国务院关于做好春耕工作、争取一九五七年农业大丰收的指示
    （一九五七年三月十九日）
    “想尽一切办法，争取1957年农业大丰收”，应当成为农业生产战线上的中心口号和奋斗目标。——今年的农业生产，比以往任何一年，都具有更为有利的条件。只要善于利用一切有利条件，善于改正工作中的错误和缺点，争取今年大丰收的任务是能够实现的。——根据勤俭办社和民主办社的方针，加强农业社的经营管理工作，办好农业社。——加强小麦和油菜等作物的田间管理，争取小春和夏熟作物的大丰收，作好春播工作；因地制宜地推行增产技术措施，提高单位面积产量。——贯彻执行优先发展粮食生产，同时发展棉花和各种经济作物、发展多种经济的方针。——特别注意加强灾区、山区和低产地区的生产领导工作。——作好农村生产资料的供应工作和农产品的收购工作，做好农贷和其他经济工作。——要求各级党委加强领导，选派一批得力干部，深入到乡和农业社中去，掀起一个更深入、更踏实、更健康的生产大运动。
    一
    1957年是我国实现全面农业合作化的第二年，是我国第一个五年计划末尾的一年，争取1957年农业大丰收，对于社会主义的农业合作化制度的巩固，对于社会主义经济建设的发展，都具有特别重要的意义。1956年，在全国实现农业合作化的基础上，战胜了严重的自然灾害，各种主要农作物（除棉花以外）的产量，比丰收的1955年都有显著的增加，大多数合作社增加了生产，大多数社员增加了收入，已经明白地显示出社会主义农业的优越性。实现1957年的农业大丰收，将使更多的社员增加更多的收入，将使农民的口粮和饲料相应地增加，从而也就将更加充分地发挥社会主义农业的优越性，使社会主义的农业经济制度更进一步巩固起来。同时，实现1957年的农业大丰收，就可以有更多的粮食和副食品来供应城市，有更多的工业原料来供应工业，从而保证对城市、乡村工业品的供应，进一步提高农民的购买力，扩大工业品在农村的销售市场，增加社会主义积累；并且可以增加出口物资，换回更多的工业设备，更有力地支援工业建设。实现1957年的农业大丰收，全面完成和更多地超额完成第一个五年计划，将使我国在更为有利的条件下，进入发展国民经济的第二个五年计划。因此，“想尽一切办法，争取1957年农业大丰收”，应当成为农业生产战线上的中心口号和奋斗目标。
    二
    1957年的农业生产，比以往任何一年，都具有更为有利的条件。
    第一，已经在全国范围内基本上实现了高级形式的农业合作化，这是发展农业生产的最根本的有利条件。这同去年春耕时期既忙于春耕生产，又忙于扩社、并社和初级社转高级社那种“两头忙”的情况，是显然不同的。
    第二，今年的春耕生产，比去年动手早得多，也准备的好得多。许多地方，正在紧张地进行着备耕工作，有的地方已经掀起春耕生产的热潮。
    第三，各级干部和广大农民，都在去年的农业合作化高潮和农业生产高潮中间，取得了相当丰富的经验和教训，可以把农业合作社办得比去年更好，把农业生产工作做得比去年更好。
    第四，去年进行的规模宏大的农田基本建设，例如小型水利、土地整理、土壤改良等等，有一部分在今年才能充分发挥效益，加上今年继续兴修农田水利，毫无疑问，今年的农业生产将比去年获得更多的农田水利的效益。
    第五，绝大多数的农业合作社，都准备了一定数量的种子、肥料、草料和生产所必需的流动资金。尽管还有一些合作社准备的不足，但是，同去年春耕时期、绝大多数合作社刚刚建立，种子、草料临时凑集、生产资金十分困难的情况相比，是完全不同了。
    第六，国家继续从财政上、经济上和技术上支援农业合作社，扶持农业生产。特别是某些农产品（例如猪和某几种油料等）的收购价格有了显著的提高，这对于发展这些农产品的生产是十分有利的。
    另一方面，目前大多数农业合作社干部的管理水平和经验，还不能同合作化以后大生产的要求完全相适应；某些低产地区和低产的农业合作社，还没有找到提高农作物产量的稳妥途径，还没有找到发展多种经营的门路；1956年受灾严重的地区，在恢复和发展生产上还有一定的困难。但是，所有这些困难，都是前进中的困难，依靠合作社的集体力量是完全可以克服的。比过去的个体经营时代克服这些困难要容易得多了。所以，只要我们加倍努力，善于利用一切有利条件，善于改正工作中的错误和缺点，在正常的年景下，争取1957年农业大丰收的任务是一定能够实现的。
    三
    为了实现1957年的农业大丰收，首先必须根据勤俭办社和民主办社的方针，加强农业合作社的经营管理工作，办好农业合作社。对于这个问题，中共中央和国务院在1956年4月、9月和11月，已经先后发出了专门的指示，中共中央最近又发出了关于民主办社几个事项的通知，各地应当继续切实贯彻执行。
    有些地区的春耕已经开始了，有些地方不久就要开始。为了使农民能够全力投入春耕生产，少数农业合作社，上年度的收入分配还没有结算清楚的，应该在不误春耕的前提下，抓紧时间，迅速结算清楚；并社和转高级社的工作应该暂时停止，过大的合作社分成小社的工作一般也应该暂时停止。如果有些过大的社问题确实很多，不改变确实会影响春耕生产，可以根据本地本社的具体情况和多数社员的意见，采取简便的方式进行一些必要的、适当的调整。例如，有的可以采取联社方式，社内生产除必须由联社统一经营的部分外，由各分社独立经营、自负盈亏；也可以根据各项生产的不同情况，有的由全社统一经营、统一分配，有的由各个生产队独立经营、自负盈亏；还可以采取扩大超产奖励的比例的办法，来照顾增产较多的生产队。这种种中间形式，在解决大社纠纷中，都可以根据情况研究试行，不要强求一律。
    在互利政策的执行方面，有些合作社还存在着若干遗留问题，例如生产资料入社作价不合理、可以不入社的零星树木（主要是果树）和散畜（主要是羊）也一律入了社等等，引起一部分社员的不满。这种遗留问题应该按照中央和国务院的历次指示，迅速合理解决，以利春耕生产。另一方面，最近在某些地方，发现有的富裕中农社员，看到近来骡马的市价上涨，并且觉得开放自由市场以后，经营商业运输可获厚利，于是找种种借口，把早已作价入社归社公有的骡马强拉回去，影响全社的生产，特别是当前的春耕生产。一部分富裕中农的这种行为，显然是不对的，也应该说服教育，加以制止。
    此外，据最近反映，有的农业合作社，还没有定出1957年的生产计划，必须迅速制定。还有的地方和农业合作社，在批评了1956年的生产计划偏高以后，定1957年生产计划的时候，又表现出过于保守的偏向，把今年的计划产量定得比去年的实产量还低。农业生产计划应该是充分可靠的，同时又必须是积极的、有动员力量的，既不应该盲目求高，也要反对保守情绪。同时，在制定农业生产计划方面，继续克服控制过死的毛病，以发扬农业合作社在国家计划指导下生产经营的一定的独立性，是完全必要的。但是据反映，有的地方又表现出放任自流的现象，以致有的合作社只注意局部和暂时的利益，什么赚钱多就干什么，既脱离国家计划的指导，又不考虑社员食用的需要。这种偏向，也应该注意防止。
    在农业合作社的全部经营管理工作中，必须认真实行群众路线，遇事同社员商量，建立和健全社员代表大会制度，依靠广大社员，办好合作社，从而发扬广大社员的生产积极性，发展农业生产。
    四
    为了实现1957年的农业大丰收，必须加强小麦和油菜等作物的田间管理，首先争取小春和夏熟作物的大丰收；必须做好当前的春播工作；并且必须依靠合作社的集体力量，继续积极努力，因地制宜地推行各项行之有效的增产技术措施，来提高单位面积的产量。
    1956年在兴修水利、积肥造肥、推广良种、改良土壤、推广新式农具、改变耕作制度、改进耕作技术和防治病虫灾害等等方面，都具有空前广泛的群众性的规模，取得了极其伟大的成绩，不仅大大超过以往的任何一年，而且有些增产措施比解放以来几年成绩的累计还要大。忽视总的成绩，夸大局部的缺点和错误，而在推行增产的技术措施上采取消极态度，是不对的，对于争取1957年农业大丰收，是十分有害的。但是，也应该指出，去年推行的这些增产措施，有15％左右是有缺点的，须加改进；还有百分之几是搞错了，造成了减产或其他经济损失。这些缺点和错误，也必须认真地加以总结，引为教训，不再重复。
    第一，必须继续提高复种指数，扩大双季稻面积。但是，在进行这类措施的时候，必须充分考虑到水源和肥料的多少、当地气候季节的长短、劳动力和劳动时间是否赶得上以及早晚稻品种的成熟期是否适宜等等条件，不能不顾这些条件而要求过高。
    第二，玉米和薯类在一般旱作地区是高产的，应该适当地增加种植，特别在缺粮地区，更应该积极提倡种植。但是，在那些谷子和高粱高产，农民又已经有耕作经验和食用习惯的地方，就不要盲目改种玉米和薯类。同时，在制定当前的春播计划、增种玉米和薯类的时候，还必须对本地、本社农民所需要的饲草、燃料和生活习惯通盘加以筹划。对于人民习惯食用的小杂粮，也要做适当的安排，不要顾此失彼。
    第三，培育和推广良种的工作，必须加强。各种作物的良种，在已经证明适宜种植的地方，都应该大力积极推广。对于新引进的品种，必须先行试种，成功后再推广，如果试种结果一时还难肯定，仍应继续试种，不要急于推广。对于当前春播所需要的种子，应该切实进行检查和精选，并根据余缺情况及时调剂供应；同时，还应该贮备一部分补种和备荒的种子，以应不时之需。
    第四，新式农具应该在适用的地方继续推广，并且在春耕以前和春耕期间，努力做好技术传授工作和农具修理、零件供应工作。双铧犁下水田的问题，应该继续研究试验，凡是试验未成功的地方，都不要盲目推广。已经卖出去、确实不合用、而农民要求退回的双铧犁，应该及早收回。
    第五，在春耕未开始以前和春耕结束以后，都应该利用农事闲隙，积极地兴修新的水利工程，修复和整补过去修的工程，努力扩大灌溉面积，并且同灌溉渠道、平整土地的工程结合进行，从而使兴修的水利工程充分发挥应有的效益。在计划这些工程时，还应该有防旱、防涝兼顾的观点。
    第六，应该在冬季积肥运动的基础上，开展经常性的积肥工作，积厩肥，拾粪肥，沤绿肥，烧灰肥，收集城市的粪肥和杂肥，把人畜粪尿和其他可以利用的一切肥源都充分利用起来，保证春播的基肥和作物的追肥。化肥和饼肥等商品肥料，也必须按照需肥季节及时供应。对于社员家庭积肥的报酬必须公平合理。有条件的合作社，可以采用定期支付部分现款、收购社员家庭所积粪肥的办法，这是鼓励社员家庭积肥积极性的最有效办法，也是适当解决社员零用钱的一个办法。
    第七，改进耕作技术和防治病虫灾害的一切先进经验，应该在适用的地区继续推广。并且要善于组织农业科学研究人员，各方面的农业专家和农业技术推广站的力量，使他们从科学技术方面，为实现1957年农业大丰收而努力。
    在推行各项农业增产措施的时候，必须采取积极的、因地制宜的方针，同样，也必须实行群众路线的工作方法，积极地宣传介绍先进的东西，而由农业合作社根据自己的具体条件，经过民主讨论，决定取舍。任何主观主义和命令主义的做法，都必须防止和改正。
    五
    为实现1957年的农业大丰收，必须贯彻执行优先发展粮食生产、同时发展棉花和各种经济作物、发展多种经济的方针。不仅要求粮食丰产，也要求棉花和其他各种经济作物都获得丰产，也要求畜牧业、林业、渔业和农村其他各种副业生产都有大的发展。不仅要求农业合作社的生产大大增加，也要求国营农业（牧、林、渔）企业的生产大大增加。
    在畜牧业方面，牧业区的牲畜是年年增加的，农业区的耕畜多数省份也是增加的，但是，有少数省份，主要是东北和华北数省，在1955年和1956年的两年之内，耕畜的体力减弱、繁殖率下降、死亡率增高、头数减少。这种情况，对于这些地方的农业生产，是一个严重的威胁。应该根据中央和国务院关于耕畜问题的指示，结合着当前的春耕生产，同社员认真地商量研究，按照多数社员的意见，采取一些有效的具体办法，迅速地把耕畜瘦弱死亡的情况扭转过来。生猪的收购价格已经提高了，各个地方应该抓紧这个有利条件，发动农业合作社和社员家庭多养猪，多积肥，这对于增加肉食供应、发展农业生产和增加社员收入，都是有利的。羊在农业区也是可以发展的，特别是山区和多草的地区，更有条件多养羊。家禽饲养业也应该有计划地发展。无论在牧业区和农业区，都应该加强配种繁殖工作和兽疫防治工作，保护母畜、孕畜和幼畜，提高牲畜的繁殖率，降低死亡率，使牲畜的头数大大增加起来。并且要加强牲畜的品种改良工作，培养体强力壮的大型耕畜，以适应农业合作化以后大生产的需要；培养产乳量高的乳牛、产卵量高的鸡鸭和出肉量大的家畜、家禽，发展细毛羊，以适应肉乳供应和工业发展的需要。
    当前是春季造林季节，应该在不误春耕生产的条件下，有计划地积极开展植树造林运动，在有条件的地区，应该进行大片造林以保持水土，调节气候和为实现宅旁、村旁、道旁、水旁的绿化而努力。在植树造林中，应注意多培植果树果林，给农民开辟额外收入的来源。同时，还要经常注意护林，防止森林火灾。
    要积极地发展渔业生产，做好海洋春季鱼汛期的捕捞工作，并充分利用河渠湖沼，发展淡水的渔业。
    农村各项副业生产也应该根据原料和销路的条件积极发展，以增加合作社和社员的收入，信贷部门可以在农业收获季节以前，支持农业合作社流动资金的需要。
    一切国营农业（牧、林、渔）企业，都应该积极改善经营管理，改进生产技术，精减非生产人员，提高产量、节约成本，真正发挥应有的示范作用和技术指导作用。
    六
    为实现1957年的农业大丰收，还必须特别注意加强灾区、山区和低产地区的生产领导工作。
    1956年灾情较重，受灾地区较广，由于国家的救济和支援，依靠合作社的集体力量，灾民的生活和灾区生产的恢复，一般的都有了适当的安排，但是，仍然不能忽视救灾工作。有些灾区，在当前的春耕时期，种子、农具、耕畜和饲草、饲料还存在着一定的困难，必须注意检查，帮助解决；特别要注意青黄不接时期的救济工作，防止春荒。容易遭受水涝灾害的低洼地区，应该根据雨季多在七、八月之间的经验，首先亟力争取小麦和其他早熟作物的丰收，秋季作物则采用抗涝的品种，以避免和减轻水涝灾害。反之，容易遭受旱灾的地区，则应积极兴修水利，扩大灌溉面积，并且积极研究和推广抗旱作物、抗旱品种和抗旱的栽培技术，以避免和减轻旱灾的损失。
    山区在全国占的比重很大。有些山区，单位面积产量很低，副业生产也不发展，交通极不方便，发展生产的困难较多，人民生活也较贫困。但是，山区发展生产的潜力是很大的，应该根据当地的特点，制定发展山区生产的长期规划，同水土保持的要求结合起来，有步骤地开展农、林、牧业和其他副业生产。并且逐步改善山区的交通道路，加强山区产品的收购运销工作，扶助山区生产的发展。还有一部分山区是过去革命战争时期的老根据地，曾经遭受过敌人的多次扫荡和摧残，人民的损失很大，因而在恢复和发展生产上比一般山区还要困难。国家对于这些老根据地，过去已经给了不少的照顾，今后还应该继续给以照顾，对于当前春耕中的困难，更应该大力扶持。对于少数民族聚居的贫瘠山区，在发展生产中，要特别照顾他们的民族利益。
    低产地区和高产地区中低产的田地，在全国耕地面积中还占有很大的比重。变低产为高产，是增加农业生产的重要环节，近年来已创造了不少好的经验，应当加以科学地总结和推广。各个低产区和有低产田的地方，应当根据当地的特点，参照其他地区变高产的经验，找出提高当地产量的关键，制订具体可行的措施和计划，逐步实现。
    七
    做好农村生产资料的供应工作和农产品的收购工作，做好农业贷款和其他经济工作，对于农业生产的发展，任何时候都是十分重要的。在农业合作化以后，已经由个体小农生产变成了集体的大生产，上述工作的重要性就更为明显了。1956年，在供销工作、农贷工作等等方面，确实表现了支援合作化的高度积极性，在促进合作化和增加生产上都收到了显著的效果。今年是实现农业合作化的第二年，农业生产合作社还是迫切需要各方面继续给以扶持的。今年的农业增产任务是很艰巨的，也急需各个有关的经济部门继续给以支持。在这一方面，任何松劲情绪，都是不对的。国家银行必须进一步做好农贷的发放工作和到期农贷的收回工作，并且使农业贷款同预购定金结合起来，更好地发挥支持生产的作用。供销合作和其他有关部门，在商品肥料、农具、农药、农械和提水设备的供应方面，应该摸清各个地区不同的季节和不同的需要，有计划地加以安排，保证不误季节需要，及时供应到农业合作社；但是必须注意防止机械地要求合作社按计划和合同购货，特别是农药、农械和遭灾后需要的追肥，更不能如此。还应该积极开辟货源，特别是商品肥料的货源，增加供应量，以适应农业合作化以后用肥量增加的需要。耕畜的调剂贩运，也应该迅速恢复起来。
    八
    繁忙的春耕活动在南方已经开始了，北方大地即将解冻，春耕季节也很快就要到来。农业生产是农村一切工作的中心。要求各级党政加强领导，并且结合机关的精简，充实下层，选派一批得力干部，深入到乡，深入到农业合作社中去，跟全体农民一起，积极行动起来，掀起一个更深入、更踏实、更健康的农业生产大运动，想尽一切办法，为实现1957年农业大丰收而奋斗。
