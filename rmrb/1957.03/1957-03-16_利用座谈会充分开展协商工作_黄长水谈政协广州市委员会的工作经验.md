I wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao's instructions at the Supreme State Conference and Premier Zhou's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries. I agree with Vice-Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the Standing Committee.

Now, I would like to report on some experiences of the activity groups of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the CPPCC to everyone. I hope the members will point out any inappropriate aspects.

**What Issues Did the Symposiums Discuss?**

The symposiums revolved around the major measures of the Party and the government at various periods and the central work of the city. For example, the industry and commerce group discussed market arrangements and public-private labor-capital relations; the cleaning of assets and determination of capital, personnel arrangements, and public-private co-management relations and related issues during the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce; the culture, education, science, and health group discussed the implementation of the Party's policy on intellectuals and the march towards science, and the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy in culture and art; the party group discussed personnel arrangements, related candidate lists, the CCP's proposed policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the CCP and various democratic parties, and the cooperative relations between Communist Party members and non-Party members in state organs, enterprises, organizations, and schools, and exchanged work experiences; the overseas group discussed and handled issues related to compatriots returning to Guangzhou from Hong Kong and Macau, overseas united front work and the implementation of the overseas Chinese policy, entry and exit, early changes to the class status of overseas Chinese landlords, and housing property rights and rental disputes; and the comprehensive group discussed the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and problems existing in the implementation of ethnic minority policies and religious policies. The symposiums must not only fully promote democracy, allowing participants to express their opinions and demands freely, but also publicize and explain the Party and government's policies and measures, and explain major problems and difficulties in the work. This will facilitate mutual understanding and make it easier to achieve consensus in thinking. After the symposiums, purely political and administrative issues are submitted to relevant parties for reference and handling, and are concluded as long as they are resolved and accounted for. Issues that are related to the united front are strived to be resolved reasonably. Among them, larger issues are strived to be resolved satisfactorily within the power of the CPPCC. In the second half of last year, the six working groups reflected a total of 2,449 opinions, of which more than 70% have been handled. Some outstanding problems in united front work have also been jointly resolved with relevant parties, so that united front relations have been improved and the role of the CPPCC has been brought into play.

**Extensively Absorb Representative Figures to Participate in Symposiums**

In order to give participants more opportunities to speak, smaller-scale symposiums are preferred. General symposiums have themes, but sometimes untitled symposiums are also held. The discussion should be relaxed and casual, so that everyone can talk about anything, and bold speeches and debates should be encouraged. Through discussion and research, right and wrong can be distinguished and the truth can be clarified. Participation in symposiums is not limited to members. When the comprehensive group discussed issues related to Kuomintang military and political personnel, it not only invited former Kuomintang military and political personnel in organs and parties, but also invited relevant people from society to participate. We not only invited upper-level figures among them, but also invited middle and lower-level elements. Symposiums on scientific and technological issues paid attention to inviting scientific and technological personnel from universities, colleges, state-owned factories, state organs, public-private joint ventures, and private individuals with technical skills in private enterprises. Discussions on medical and health issues paid attention to inviting doctors of traditional Chinese medicine, Western medicine, dentists, midwives, practicing doctors, doctors from private hospitals, doctors from joint clinics, doctors from health stations, and nurses. From March to September of last year, 61 symposiums were held, with 1,500 participants. In this way, the enthusiasm of the members can be brought into play more comprehensively, and more representative figures from all walks of life can have the opportunity to put forward their opinions and demands through the working groups of the CPPCC, so that they can understand the policies of the Party and the government and some important measures. In this way, the working groups can become a convenient organizational form to assist the Standing Committee in strengthening ties with the masses and carrying out daily consultative work. It flexibly expands and strengthens the ties between the Communist Party, the government, and democratic people from all walks of life, as well as between democratic people from all walks of life, expands the scope of consultative work, and enriches the content of the CPPCC's work. This is the most frequent and concrete manifestation of consolidating and expanding the people's democratic united front through the CPPCC.

**We Should Focus on Issues Related to the United Front for Consultation**

Although symposiums encourage everyone to talk about anything, not every trivial matter should be discussed. Instead, we should focus on issues related to the united front for consultation. For example, in the symposium for middle and primary school teachers, we focused on consulting and resolving some problems in the implementation of the policy on this part of intellectuals, such as their work, study, life, relations between the Party and the masses, and issues that are beneficial or detrimental to their enthusiasm, instead of discussing purely professional issues related to how to teach in order to improve teaching quality. The symposium for private technical personnel only discussed relevant issues that currently help or hinder the exertion of their active role, instead of discussing how they should improve production technology. In this way, the activities of the working groups will not overlap with the work of state organs, enterprises, or other organizations, nor will they create abnormal relations between the CPPCC and other parties, increase the burden on democratic people, or deviate from the spirit of the CPPCC charter.

**Be Good at Discovering Problems and Conducting Serious Investigation and Analysis**

On the basis of extensively contacting democratic people from all walks of life and universally collecting mass opinions in this regard, the working groups should also be good at discovering prominent issues in united front relations that have a greater impact at present, conduct in-depth investigation and research, and make proposals with situations, analysis, and opinions on solving problems, and send them to relevant parties for adoption and implementation. All major suggestions should also be submitted to the Standing Committee for discussion. This can not only enrich the consultative content of the Standing Committee, overcome the passive situation of having nothing to talk about or waiting for the Party committee or the People's Committee to submit proposals, invigorate democratic life, and further overcome the formalism of the Standing Committee meetings, but also, after careful deliberation and discussion by the Standing Committee, the resolutions are then sent to relevant parties, the problems are more likely to be solved, and the prestige of the CPPCC's work is improved. In the past, because we did not understand this point, although the working groups reflected many opinions, they were not specific, or only belonged to hearsay, without analysis and research, the opinions were incomplete, not pertinent, and only half of them could be sent to relevant parties for reference. Relevant parties only solved some relatively simple problems. Those problems that have not been solved for many years or are more complicated, because we reflect the situation incompletely, lack analysis, and lack solutions, are not easy to attract the attention of relevant parties, and the problem is solved slowly. Due to the low quality of consultative work, it gradually aroused dissatisfaction among some members and other democratic people. Some people said: "If you hold a symposium that cannot solve problems in the future, don't ask me to come." Relevant parties also felt that although the CPPCC reflected many opinions, they were not specific, were one-sided, difficult to handle, or did not help much to improve work. We accepted this lesson, and each working group paid attention to finding some major problems in the many opinions reflected in the symposium, organizing the strength of members and cadres, conducting inspections, investigations, analysis, and research on the problems, and then making practical and feasible written suggestions. For example: "Opinions on improving the professional and political theory learning of middle and primary school teachers," "On overcoming the busy and chaotic phenomenon in primary school education," "On arranging senior intellectuals to participate in social activities," "On the main problems existing in the medical and health circles," "On handling the entry and exit problems of overseas Chinese and their dependents," etc. Because the groups were serious and responsible for their work, they made reports with situations, analysis, and suggestions on the more important issues discussed. This not only easily aroused the attention of relevant parties to the problems raised by the CPPCC, and seriously solved the problems, but also easily alerted them to the need to go deep into the work, overcome bureaucracy, and can promote members and democratic people to deeply contact the masses they contact, and more deeply understand the truth of things, which helps to overcome the subjective and one-sided shortcomings in the thinking of some people, and makes people gradually realize the importance of observing things and dealing with problems from the correct stand and ideological methods, and with a responsible attitude, and improve people's ideological understanding in the practice of political life. This is the role of mutual supervision that the CPPCC and the Party and the government and other relevant parties can often play.

**The Party Committee Should Strengthen Leadership Over the Work of the CPPCC**

In order to do a good job in the activities of the working groups, it is also important that the members of the Chinese Communist Party and the persons in charge of relevant parties often participate in the symposiums. Because the consultative work is mainly the consultation of united front relations, and there are also many consultations on issues between departments and departments, and units and units, it is difficult to achieve results without the participation of members of the Chinese Communist Party or persons in charge of relevant parties in the consultation process of the working groups. Of course, the opinions reflected by the working groups are handled and replied to by the relevant parties separately, accepting what is right and explaining what is wrong is also a kind of consultation, but it is not as effective as face-to-face consultation, and the problem is solved faster. In the past and now, there is a situation where relevant parties do not pay much attention to the work of the CPPCC, but I think that as long as the Chinese Communist Party Committee strengthens its leadership and the CPPCC itself does its work well, this problem is not difficult to solve.

In general, in Guangzhou in the past two years, due to the improvement of the CPPCC's work, through these work, the great vitality of this organizational form of our country's people's democratic united front -- the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference -- has become increasingly apparent. Through the work of the CPPCC, we can not only more widely unite the people of all strata and assist state organs to more effectively exercise dictatorship over the enemy, but on the other hand, we can more and more timely reflect and properly handle the various contradictions within the people. Therefore, I think that we must further expand and consolidate the organizations of the CPPCC at all levels, carry out various beneficial activities, cooperate with the work of the People's Congresses and People's Committees at all levels, and build our country's socialist construction cause faster and better.

### 利用座谈会充分开展协商工作  黄长水谈政协广州市委员会的工作经验

    利用座谈会充分开展协商工作
    黄长水谈政协广州市委员会的工作经验
    我衷心拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上的指示和周总理访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告，同意陈叔通副主席关于常务委员会的工作报告。
    我现在将政协广州市委员会的工作组活动的一些体会来向大家报告，不妥当的地方，还要请委员们给以指正。
    人民政协广州市委员会建立了党派、工商、文教、科卫、海外和综合（包括宗教、少数民族和特邀委员）等六个工作组，由全体委员自愿报名参加。工作组的活动方式主要是召开座谈会，两年来，各工作组共开过一百几十次座谈会，活动是相当多的。
    座谈会讨论了那些问题
    座谈会是围绕着党和政府各个时期的重大措施和市的中心工作来进行协商的，如工商组座谈市场安排、公私劳资关系，资本主义工商业社会主义改造过程中的清产核资、人事安排、公私共事关系及有关问题；文教科卫组座谈党对知识分子的政策的贯彻和向科学进军、文化艺术上的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针等问题；党派组座谈人事安排、有关候选人名单、中共所提出来的中共同各民主党派长期共存、互相监督的方针及国家机关、企业、团体和学校中共产党员与非共产党员的合作关系等问题，交流工作经验；海外组座谈和处理有关港澳回穗同胞的问题，海外统战工作及华侨政策的贯彻、出入国境、提早改变华侨地主成分和房屋产权、租务纠纷等问题；综合组座谈争取和平解放台湾、贯彻少数民族政策与宗教政策中存在的问题。座谈会既要充分发扬民主，让与会者畅所欲言地表达意见和要求，又要宣传解释党和政府的政策、措施，说明工作中的重大问题和困难，这才能互通声气，使思想认识比较容易一致。座谈会后，把纯属政务性和事务性的问题送交有关方面参考处理，只要有着落，有交代便了结；属于统战性的问题，则力求做到合理解决，其中属于大的还要尽政协之力所能及求得完满解决。去年下半年六个工作组反映的意见共二千四百四十九宗，已处理的占70％以上，也和有关方面共同解决了一些统战工作上的突出问题，使统战关系得到改善，政协作用有所发挥。
    广泛吸收有代表性的人物参加座谈
    要使参加座谈会的人得到更多的发言机会，以小型的为好。一般座谈都有主题，但有时也举行无题座谈会，谈时既要轻松随便，这样便可以使大家无所不谈，又要提倡大胆发言，展开争论，通过讨论研究，便可以分清是非，辨明真理。参加座谈会的，并不以委员为限。综合组讨论到有关国民党军政人员的问题时，不仅邀请在机关和党派中的前国民党军政人员，还邀请社会上有关人士参加。我们不只邀请他们中的上层人物，也邀请中下层分子；有关科技问题的座谈会就注意邀请到大、专学校的、国营工厂的、国家机关的、公私合营工厂的科技人员以及私人企业中有技术的私方人员；讨论医药卫生方面的问题，则注意邀请中医、西医、牙医、助产士、开业医生、私人医院医生、联合诊所医生、保健站医生及护士等。去年3月至9月间举行的六十一次座谈会，参加的达一千五百人次。这样就可较全面的发挥各委员的积极性，可让各方面较有代表性的人物都有机会通过政协的工作组提出他们的意见和要求，使他们能了解党和政府的政策和一些重要的措施。这样就可以使工作组成为协助常委会加强联系群众并进行日常的协商工作的便利的组织形式，它灵活地扩大和加强了共产党、政府同各界民主人士之间，各界民主人士相互之间的联系，扩大了协商工作的范围，充实了政协工作的内容，这就是通过政协以巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线的最经常最具体的表现。
    应该抓紧有关统一战线的问题来协商
    座谈会上虽然提倡无所不谈，但也不是任何鸡毛蒜皮事都要开展讨论，而是应该抓紧有关统战的问题来协商。例如中、小学教师座谈会，我们是着重协商解决对这部分知识分子政策贯彻中的若干问题，如他们的工作、学习、生活、党群关系等方面，有益或有损于他们的积极性的问题，而不去商讨有关如何教学才能提高教学质量的纯业务性的问题。私方技术人员的座谈会，只是商讨当前有助于或妨碍他们的积极作用之发挥的有关问题，而不商讨他们应如何改进生产技术的问题。这样，工作组的活动就不致和国家机关、企业或其他团体的工作重复，也才不致形成政协与其他方面关系的不正常，增加民主人士的负担，和离开了政协章程的精神。要善于发现问题并认真作调查分析
    工作组还要在广泛联系各界民主人士，普遍搜集这方面群众意见的基础上，善于发现当前影响较大的突出的统战关系的问题，进行深入的调查研究，作出有情况有分析又有解决问题意见的建议书，送有关方面采择施行，凡属更重大的建议，还应提付常委会讨论，这不但可以丰富常委会的协商内容，克服无事可谈或等待党委或人委交议的被动局面，活跃民主生活，进一步克服常委会议的形式主义，而且经过常委会慎审商讨作了决议然后送给有关方面，问题就更易获得解决，也提高政协的工作威信。过去由于我们对这一点体会不到，各工作组所反映的意见虽多，却不具体，或仅属于道听途说，没有分析研究，意见不完整，欠中肯，只能送有关方面参考的占半数，有关方面也只是解决一些比较简单的问题，那些多年未得解决或比较复杂的问题，由于我们反映情况欠具体，少分析，又缺乏解决办法，就不易引起有关方面的注意，解决问题也慢。由于协商的工作质量不高，渐渐引起部分委员和其他民主人士的不满。有人说：“以后如果开不能解决问题的座谈会，不要找我来”。有关方面也感到政协反映意见虽多，但不具体，片面性大，难办理，或对改进工作无多大帮助。我们接受了这个教训，各工作组都注意在座谈会反映的许多意见中找出一些主要问题，组织委员和干部力量，针对问题进行视察、调查、分析研究，再作出切实可行的书面建议。例如：“关于改进中小学教师业务和政治理论学习的意见”、“关于克服小学教育工作中的忙乱现象”、“关于安排高级知识分子参加社会活动”、“关于医药卫生界中存在的主要问题”、“关于处理华侨、侨眷出入国境问题”等。由于各组对工作的认真负责，因此对讨论过的较重要的问题都作了有情况有分析又有建议的报告，这样就不但易引起有关方面注意政协所提的问题，认真来解决问题，并易警惕到要深入工作，克服官僚主义，而且可以推动委员们及民主人士深入联系他们所联系的群众，更深入了解事物的真象，有助于克服某些人思想上的主观、片面的缺点，使人们逐渐体会到站在正确的立场和思想方法，用负责的态度去观察事物和处理问题的重要性，在政治生活的实践中提高人们的思想认识。这就是政协同党同政府以及同有关各方面所可能经常起的互相监督的作用。
    党委要加强对政协工作的领导
    要搞好工作组的活动，中共党员委员及有关方面的负责人经常参加座谈会，也是重要的。因为协商工作主要是统战关系的协商，也有许多是部门与部门，单位与单位之间问题的协商，在工作组的协商过程中，没有中共党员委员或有关方面负责人参加，是难以收效的。当然，工作组反映的意见，由有关方面分别处理答复，对的接受，不对的解释，也是一种协商，但总不比当面协商起的作用大，解决问题也要快些。过去和现在都存在有关方面不大重视政协工作的情况，不过我认为只要中共党委加强领导，政协本身的工作又做得好，这一问题是不难于解决的。
    总的来说，广州市这两年来由于政协工作的改进，通过这些工作，越来越显出我国人民民主统一战线的这一组织形式——中国人民政治协商会议——的伟大生命力了。通过政协的工作，我们不但可以更广泛地把各阶层的人民团结起来，协助国家机关更有效地对敌人实行专政，而另一方面可以更多和更及时地反映和妥善地处理人民内部的各种矛盾。因此我认为，我们必须更进一步扩大和巩固政协的各级组织，开展各种有益的活动，配合各级人民代表大会和人民委员会的工作，把我国的社会主义建设事业建设得更快更好。
