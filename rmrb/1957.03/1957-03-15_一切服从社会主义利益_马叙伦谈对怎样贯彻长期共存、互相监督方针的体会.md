    I fully agree with the various reports presented at this meeting. In particular, Chairman Mao's important instructions on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, given before the opening of the conference, have given me new enlightenment in the application of Marxist-Leninist theory. I will do my best to study and implement these instructions.

    The Chinese Communist Party's proposal of the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision with democratic parties once again declares that cooperation with non-Party figures is not only a basic principle that the Communist Party adhered to in the past and adheres to now, but also a fixed and unchangeable basic principle that it will adhere to in the future. The explicit proposal of this major policy not only further clarified the nature and tasks of the democratic parties, greatly encouraged the confidence of the members of the democratic parties to move forward, and promoted the work and organizational development of the democratic parties, but also clarified to a certain extent some inappropriate views of the democratic parties in society, thereby further developing the people's democratic united front. Facts have proved that the proposal of this policy is in line with the development of China's social history and in line with the common aspirations of the people of the whole country to build socialism. There is no doubt that implementing this policy is an extremely glorious and solemn task for our democratic parties.

    The important issue at present is how we should do practical work to further implement this policy. We generally talk more and do less, demanding more from others and less from ourselves. For example, when discussing how to implement the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, some comrades in our democratic parties believe that this policy was put forward by the Party, and the key to how to implement it lies with the Party, etc. I think we should look inward. It is true that the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision was put forward by the Communist Party. However, whether it can exist for a long time and whether it can play a greater role mainly depends on the work of the democratic parties themselves. That is to say, it depends on the democratic parties engaging in more activities that are beneficial to the people. If more things that are beneficial to socialism are done, people will not fail to pay attention to them, and the activities of the democratic parties will receive more support from all aspects. So, how should democratic parties implement the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision? I would like to briefly talk about some of my experiences here.

    Helping our members and the masses they connect with to carry out self-ideological transformation for a long time
    I have always believed that maintaining close ties with the masses and helping members and the masses they connect with to carry out self-ideological transformation is the most basic historical task of our democratic parties. After the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision was put forward, some comrades raised the question: "Now that the socialist transformation has been basically completed, and the vast majority of the members of the democratic parties have become working people, is it still necessary for the democratic parties to emphasize ideological transformation? Even if it is still necessary to emphasize it at present, will it still be necessary to emphasize it for a long time in the future?" I think it is definitely necessary. Ideological transformation is long-term and endless, and for democratic parties, it is a lifelong matter. After the completion of the socialist transformation, the most basic task of the democratic parties is to help its members and the masses they connect with to gradually transform themselves and eliminate the remnants of bourgeois ideology. This is the most glorious task entrusted to the democratic parties by history. The social foundation of our democratic parties is the national bourgeoisie and the upper petty bourgeoisie, but what we pursue is the prosperity, strength, happiness and freedom of the motherland, and the road we have chosen is the road proposed by the Communist Party. Since our work was not for preserving the narrow interests of the class when classes existed, but happily supported and accepted the policy of peaceful elimination of classes proposed by the Communist Party, then after the elimination of classes, we do not need to preserve the ideological remnants of the class even more, but should concentrate our efforts to carry out work to eliminate the ideological remnants of the class as soon as possible. Therefore, after the completion of the socialist transformation, the ideological education work of the democratic parties should not only not be weakened, but also be greatly strengthened.

    Recognize the purpose of mutual supervision and give play to the role of mutual supervision
    The reason why it is necessary for the democratic parties and the Communist Party to coexist for a long time lies in the implementation of mutual supervision between them. Chairman Mao said that supervision is criticism, and mutual supervision is mutual criticism. Some comrades in the democratic parties say that long-term coexistence is easy, but supervision is difficult, and they are afraid to talk about supervision. I think that if we thoroughly understand the purpose of supervision, we should not only not be afraid to talk about supervision, but also be brave in playing the role of supervision. The policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision is based on the unshakable foundation that everyone is working together to do their best for the cause of socialism. Supervision itself is not the purpose, so it should not be for the sake of supervision, like the "school supervisors" and "supervisors" in the old society, looking for faults for the sake of finding faults. The purpose of implementing mutual supervision is to distinguish right from wrong within the people, strengthen our socialist consistency in political thought, avoid and correct shortcomings and mistakes in work, and is conducive to the development of the socialist cause. Therefore, the most positive purpose of the democratic parties' supervision of the Communist Party should be to support and consolidate the Party's leadership. This is also playing the role of the Party's assistant.

    Actively help the Party and the government improve their work
    The system of our country is the people's democratic dictatorship, that is, dictatorship over the enemy, and at the same time, broad democracy over the people. The Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have always regarded implementing the mass line, maintaining close ties with the masses, and relying on the masses as the important key to doing all work well. In order to meet the needs of the development of the socialist cause, the Chinese Communist Party has also proposed to further expand democratic life and carry out the struggle against bureaucracy. Our democratic parties participate in the work of government management. On the one hand, we must humbly accept the supervision of the Party and the broad masses of the people. On the other hand, we must also be good at studying and concentrating the opinions of the masses we connect with, reflecting them to the relevant departments, and actively helping the Party and the government to improve their work and correct their shortcomings in a timely manner. At the same time, we must also recognize that the democracy in our country is democracy under centralized leadership. This kind of socialist democracy must, on the one hand, give full play to the enthusiasm and initiative of the broad masses of the people, and on the other hand, ensure the necessary centralization and unity, and guarantee and maintain the strengthening of the Party's leading role in the socialist cause. We have deeply realized from many years of practical life that strengthening the leading role of the Chinese Communist Party in all aspects of our country's politics, economy, and culture is the fundamental guarantee for uniting all forces at home and abroad, defeating enemies, and overcoming difficulties. The achievements of our democratic parties in various tasks must also rely on the leadership and help of the Communist Party.

    Actively represent the legitimate interests of the strata they connect with
    In the work of implementing the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, the democratic parties must also actively represent the legitimate interests of the strata they connect with. The democratic parties are parties representing the national bourgeoisie, the upper petty bourgeoisie and its intellectuals, and will become parties representing the laborers from this class after the completion of the socialist transformation. In order to give play to the enthusiasm of members and the masses they connect with, representing their legitimate interests and reasonable demands is an important task for us not only in the past, but also in the future. Therefore, we must often deeply understand the ideological conditions, difficulties and problems of members and the masses they connect with in their lives and work, and help them solve them reasonably. However, for those illegitimate demands or demands that exceed the possible conditions of reality, we should be responsible for persuasion and explanation, and should not unconditionally accommodate them, or irresponsibly push them to the Party and the government. I think it is very necessary to pay attention to this point at the present time, because when we are engaged in construction in this economically backward country, the development of productive forces cannot keep up with the growth of people's needs, which is a long-term contradiction. This contradiction will be expressed in various aspects. If we cannot correctly treat it, we will not only fail to give play to positive factors, but also expand contradictions, which will be unfavorable to the development of the socialist cause.

    In short, everything for socialism, everything subordinate to the interests of socialism, this is the highest yardstick for checking whether the various tasks of our democratic parties are correct or not, and it is also the basic requirement that the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision puts forward for our democratic parties. In order to adapt to this requirement, we still need to work harder and study harder.

    一切服从社会主义利益
    马叙伦谈对怎样贯彻长期共存、互相监督方针的体会
    我完全同意这次会的各项报告。特别是在大会开幕前毛主席关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题的重要指示，使我对于马列主义理论的运用，得到了新的启发。我将尽我最大的努力来学习并贯彻这些指示。
    中国共产党提出同民主党派长期共存、互相监督的方针，再一次宣告了同党外人士合作，不仅过去是，现在是，而且今后也是共产党所坚持的一项固定不移和永远不变的基本原则。这个重大方针的明确提出，不但进一步阐明了民主党派的性质任务，极大地鼓舞了民主党派成员前进的信心，推动了民主党派的工作和组织的发展，而且在一定程度上澄清了社会上对民主党派的某些不适当的看法，从而使人民民主统一战线有了进一步的发展。事实证明，这一方针的提出是符合于我国社会历史的发展，符合于全国人民建设社会主义的共同愿望的。毫无疑问，贯彻执行这一方针，乃是我们民主党派极其光荣和庄严的任务。
    当前的重要问题，是我们应如何切切实实做工作来进一步贯彻这一方针的问题。我们一般人往往说得多，做得少，要求别人多，要求自己少。譬如在讨论如何贯彻长期共存、互相监督这一方针的时候，我们民主党派就有一些同志，认为这个方针是党提出来的，如何贯彻，其关键在党等等。我认为我们应该反求诸己。不错，长期共存、互相监督的方针是共产党提出的。但是，能否长存，能否发挥更大的作用，主要还是要看民主党派本身的工作。也就是说要靠民主党派多从事有益人民的活动。有益于社会主义的事情做得多了，就不会不受到人们的重视，民主党派的活动也就会得到各方面更多的支持。那么，民主党派应如何贯彻长期共存、互相监督的方针呢？我想在这里简单谈一点我的体会。
    帮助自己的成员和所联系的
    群众长期进行自我思想改造
    我一向认为密切联系群众，帮助成员和所联系的群众进行自我思想改造，是我们民主党派最基本的历史任务。在长期共存、互相监督的方针提出来后，有些同志提出来问：“现在社会主义改造已基本完成，民主党派的成员绝大多数已变成劳动人民，民主党派是否还有必要强调思想改造工作呢？即使目前还需要强调，将来是否还需要长期强调呢？”我认为肯定是需要的。思想改造是长期的，无止境的，对民主党派来说这是一辈子的事。在社会主义改造完成后，民主党派最基本的一项工作就是要帮助它的成员和所联系群众逐步地改造自己，消除资产阶级思想残余，这是历史赋予民主党派的最光荣的任务。我们民主党派的社会基础是民族资产阶级和上层小资产阶级，但是我们所追求的却是祖国的繁荣富强和幸福自由，我们所选择的道路是共产党所提出的道路。既然在阶级存在的时候，我们的工作不是为了保存阶级的狭隘利益，而是愉快地拥护和接受了共产党所提出的和平消灭阶级的政策，那么在阶级消灭以后，我们更不需要保存阶级的思想残余，而应当更加集中力量为尽快地消灭阶级思想残余而进行工作。所以在社会主义改造完成以后，民主党派的思想教育工作，不仅不应该削弱，而且还要大大地加强。
    认清互相监督的目的，
    发挥互相监督的作用
    民主党派与共产党长期共存之所以必要，还在于彼此间实行互相监督。毛主席说监督就是批评，互相监督就是互相批评。民主党派中有些同志说长期容易，监督难，怕谈监督。我认为如果我们把监督的目的透彻的认识清楚了，不但不应该怕谈监督，而且要勇于发挥监督作用。长期共存、互相监督的方针是建立在大家共同为社会主义事业尽职竭能的这一不可动摇的基础上的。监督本身不是目的，所以不应该是为要监督而监督，像旧社会的“学监”“督办”那样，为找岔子而找岔子。实行互相监督的目的是为了分清人民内部的是非，加强我们在政治思想上的社会主义一致性，避免和改正工作中的缺点错误，有利于社会主义事业的发展。因此，民主党派对共产党进行监督，其最积极的目的应该是支持和巩固党的领导。这也就是发挥党的助手作用。
    积极帮助党和政府改进工作
    我们的国家的制度是人民民主专政，就是对敌人实行专政，同时，对人民实行广泛的民主。中国共产党和人民政府从来就是把贯彻执行群众路线、密切联系群众和依靠群众作为做好一切工作的重要关键的。为了社会主义事业发展的需要，中国共产党又提出了进一步扩大民主生活，开展反官僚主义的斗争。我们民主党派参加了政权管理工作，一方面要虚心接受党和广大人民的监督，另一方面也要善于研究和集中所联系的群众的意见，反映给有关部门，积极帮助党和政府及时改进工作，纠正缺点。同时，也必须认识我们国家的民主是集中领导下的民主。这种社会主义民主一方面要充分发挥广大人民的积极性和主动精神，另一方面也要保证必要的集中和统一，保证和维护加强党在社会主义事业中的领导作用。我们从多年来的实际生活中已经深刻认识到加强中国共产党在我们国家政治、经济、文化各方面的领导作用，乃是团结国内外一切力量，战胜敌人，克服困难的根本保证。我们民主党派各项工作的成就也必须依靠共产党的领导和帮助。
    积极代表所联系阶层的正当利益
    民主党派在贯彻长期共存、互相监督方针的工作中，还必须积极代表所联系阶层的正当利益。民主党派是代表民族资产阶级、上层小资产阶级和它的知识分子的党派，在社会主义改造完成后将成为代表出身这种阶级的劳动者的党派。为了发挥成员和所联系群众的积极性，代表他们的正当利益和合理要求，不但在过去，就是在将来也是我们一项重要的工作。因此，我们必须经常深入了解成员和所联系的群众在生活、工作中的思想情况，困难和问题，帮助他们合理解决。但是，对于那些不正当的要求或超过现实可能条件的要求，应当负责进行说服解释，而不应当无原则的迁就，或者不负责任的推之于党和政府。我认为注意这一点在现时很有必要，因为在我们这个经济落后的国家进行建设的时候，生产力的发展赶不上人民需要的增长，是一个长期存在的矛盾，这个矛盾将从各方面表现出来。我们如果不能正确对待它，不仅不能发挥积极的因素，而且会扩大矛盾，不利于社会主义事业的发展。
    总之，一切为了社会主义，一切服从社会主义利益，这是检查我们民主党派各项工作正确与否的最高尺度，也是长期共存、互相监督这一方针对我们民主党派提出的基本要求。为适应这一要求，我们还需要努力再努力，学习再学习。
