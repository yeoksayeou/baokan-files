Cultivating Fields Without People or Cattle
Jiangsu Achieves Success in Trial Production of Wind-Powered Tillage Machines

(Our Correspondent Shi Yue'e reports) The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Implement Department and the Gaoyou County Agricultural Implement Experimental Station have achieved significant results in researching wind-powered tillage machines using rope traction. The power of this tillage machine can come from wind power, animal power, internal combustion engines, and human power, essentially achieving the goal of people and cattle not having to enter the fields. This is welcome news for agricultural implement work in our country's paddy fields.

Jiangsu Province has approximately five million mu of waterlogged paddy fields. These fields are perennially submerged in water and are very sticky. Cattle can only till about one mu per day in these waterlogged fields. If people pull the plow, it requires three people to pull and one person to guide, and they can only till three or four mu per day, which is extremely laborious. The successful trial of rope-traction tillage machines will greatly contribute to increasing production in the nation's more than 40 million mu of waterlogged paddy fields and alleviating the heavy physical labor of farmers.

The wind-powered tillage machine using rope traction consists of a windmill with two wind wheels, one with eight blades and one with six blades. These drive two winches at the bottom of the windmill to wind the steel wire ropes, which pull a two-way plow back and forth in the waterlogged field. This plow is also a specially made two-way plow, capable of plowing in both directions. After plowing one row, a pulley is used to pull and move the plow head, automatically releasing a one-foot row spacing through a plow-moving device installed on the rope at the top of the plow head, thereby preventing repeated plowing. This wind-powered tillage machine requires one person to manage the windmill and one or two people to adjust the ropes.

According to tests conducted by the Gaoyou County Agricultural Implement Experimental Station, they used the rope-traction wind-powered tillage machine to till 62 mu of waterlogged paddy fields in approximately ten working days, including 29 mu of first plowing, 29 mu of second plowing, and 4 mu of third plowing. The test results showed that the working efficiency of a wind-powered tillage machine can reach a maximum of 7 mu per day in level four winds, and under normal wind conditions, it can till 4 mu per day, which is three to seven times faster than using cattle or human-pulled plows in similar waterlogged fields. It is estimated that for every 100 mu of land tilled by a wind-powered tillage machine, it saves 300 labor days compared to people pulling plows in the waterlogged fields. Moreover, the plow head tills to a depth of five inches and a width of one foot, with good soil coverage.

This rope-traction wind-powered tillage machine was designed by Li Zhaosen, Deputy Director of the Agricultural Implement Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture, with the assistance of technicians, drawing on the experience of the masses. Having witnessed the difficulties faced by farmers in the Gaoyou area in tilling waterlogged fields since childhood, he had been researching the use of wind power for tillage for over a decade. After many experiments, he initially produced a wind-powered tillage machine in 1950. After 1952, he collaborated with Lin Tiqiang, Assistant Researcher at the East China Agricultural Science Institute (one of the main designers of the rice transplanter), and made many improvements to the plow head and rope traction during the experimental process. In recent years, during on-site trials at the Gaoyou County Agricultural Implement Experimental Station, the technical personnel of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Implement Department and the Gaoyou Agricultural Implement Experimental Station have researched extending the ropes to expand the tillage area, so that one windmill can manage 80 to 100 mu of land before needing to be moved, compared to the original 20 mu. At the same time, in order to overcome the difficulties of tilling in the absence of wind or when the wind is weak, they have also tried using cattle, internal combustion engine transmission, and human-powered pedaling to pull the two-way plow for tilling, and the results have been very good. The Lanhua Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangpu County has used animal power to pull a tillage machine and has already tilled more than 50 mu of deeply sunken fields.

However, because the mechanical structure of the windmill has not yet been finalized, the cost is relatively high, and the windmill's wind-direction mechanism is not complete enough, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Implement Department is currently making further improvements and experiments, preparing to expand the use of rope-traction wind-powered tillage machines on the existing basis and experiment with improving the windmills already owned by the masses to become machines that are both low-cost and capable of both irrigation and tillage, in order to better serve agricultural production.

### 人和牛不下田  也能耕好田  江苏试制风力耕田机获得成效

    人和牛不下田  也能耕好田
    江苏试制风力耕田机获得成效
    本报讯  本报记者史越峨报道：江苏省农业厅农具处和高邮县农具试验站研究用绳索牵引的风力耕田机，获得显著的效果。这种耕田机的动力除了风力，还可以使用畜力、内燃机和人力，基本上做到人、牛不下田，这是我国水田农具工作中一个喜讯。
    江苏省内约有五百万亩水沤田，这种田常年淹在水里，粘性很重。牛下沤田一天只能耕一亩左右。用人拉犁就要三个人拉犁，一个人扶犁，每天也只能耕三、四亩，而且十分劳累。绳索牵引耕田机的试验成功，为全国四千多万亩水沤田的增产和解除农民繁重的体力劳动有很大作用。
    用绳索牵引的风力耕田机是在一部风车上同时装着八翼和六翼的两个风轮，通过风车下部装两个绞盘绞动铅丝绳索，使绳索牵引双向犁在沤田中来回耕作。这种犁也是特制的双向犁，两面都能耕作，耕完一行，通过滑车牵动，犁头顶端的绳索上装置的移犁器，自动放出一尺长的行距，再进行耕作，使耕作不再重复。这种风力耕田机需要一个人管理风车，一、两人负责调整绳索。
    根据高邮县农具试验站的试验，他们应用绳索牵引的风力耕田机，在先后大约十个工作日的时间内就耕出六十二亩水沤田，其中有头翻田二十九亩，二翻田二十九亩，三翻田四亩。从试验效果看，一部风力耕田机的工作效率，在四级风时最高每天可耕七亩，在一般风力情况下，每天可以耕四亩，比同样性质的沤田用牛耕或人拉犁的速度要快三倍到七倍。据推算，一部风力耕田机每耕一百亩田，就比人下水田拉犁节省三百个劳动日。而且，犁头耕深五寸，耕宽一尺，复土情况良好。
    这部绳索牵引的风力耕田机是江苏省农业厅农具处副处长李兆森同志吸收群众经验，在技术人员协助下设计成的。他从小就看到家乡高邮地区农民耕沤田的困难，十几年来一直在研究利用风力耕田，经过了许多次的试验，1950年初步制成一架风力耕田机。1952年以后，他又和华东农业科学研究所助理研究员林体强（水稻插秧机的主要设计人之一）合作，在试验过程中对犁头和绳索牵引等方面作了许多改进。近年来，在高邮县农具试验站实地试验时，江苏省农业厅农具处和高邮农具试验站的技术人员又研究延长了绳索扩大耕作面积，使一部风车从原来管理二十亩田扩大到八十亩到一百亩才移动一次。同时，他们为了克服没有风和风小情况下耕田的困难，还试用牛拉、内燃机传动、人力脚踏等各种动力牵引双向犁耕田，效果也很好。江浦县兰花农业社试用畜力牵引耕田机已耕了五十多亩深陷田。
    但是，由于风车机械构造还没有定型，成本较高，风车迎风转向机构还不够完整，现在江苏省农业厅农具处正在作进一步的改进和实验，准备在现有基础上扩大绳索牵引风力耕田机的使用范围，并试验用群众原有的风车加以改良，成为成本小、灌溉耕田两用的机械，以便更好地为农业生产服务。（附图片）
