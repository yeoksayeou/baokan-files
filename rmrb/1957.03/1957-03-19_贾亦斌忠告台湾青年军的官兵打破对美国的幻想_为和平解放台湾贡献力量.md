Jia Yibin Admonishes Taiwan's Youth Army Officers and Soldiers to Abandon Illusions About the United States
Contribute to the Peaceful Liberation of Taiwan
　　After listening to Premier Zhou's report on his visits to eleven countries in Asia and Europe, I was deeply moved. I felt even more that our country has stood up. I feel proud to be a Chinese person who has stood up, and I feel the loveliness of our great motherland. Regarding the issue of the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, Premier Zhou made another concise statement, which I wholeheartedly support and am willing to work hard for this great call.
　　Now, please allow me to use this solemn platform to say a few words to the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan, especially to the officers and soldiers of the Youth Army.
　　First, I want to tell you: American imperialism is absolutely unreliable. What I mean by unreliable is, on the one hand, that American imperialism itself has reached its dying stage, and it is unlikely that it will launch a third world war quickly; even if it is launched, it will only lead to the faster and more thorough failure of imperialism. Because this is not only a matter of the balance of power, but more fundamentally a matter of justice versus injustice. On the other hand, it means that American imperialism is using and playing with you and will abandon you at any time. You should remember: Ever since Marshall made the six-character assessment of the Kuomintang government as "stubborn, selfish, and incompetent" in 1946, he manipulated behind the scenes through US Ambassador Stuart in late 1949 to have Li Zongren act as the acting president, wanting to change the flavor and give it a try. After you retreated to Taiwan, it thought you were even more incapable. It continued to keep Li Zongren in the United States; cultivated the traitor Liao Wenyi in Japan; vigorously cultivated pro-American loyalists Sun Liren and Wu Guozhen in Taiwan; and also accommodated a group of so-called democratic individualists in Hong Kong. Although some of these people have been nominally dismissed by you, some have been placed under house arrest, and some have been driven out of Taiwan. But American imperialism will not give up. The recent active preparations to instigate a coup in Taiwan are a very obvious example. The Youth Army is even more the target of its concentrated attacks. As far back as during the Anti-Japanese War, it refused to provide the Youth Army with new equipment; when it came to Nanjing, it wanted to abolish the National Defense Ministry's Reserve Cadre Bureau, abolish the Youth Army, and hand over the leadership of the Youth Army to Sun Liren, etc. These facts all show American imperialism's distrust of you, and it is absolutely unreliable for you to rely on them.
　　Why do they do this? The question is very simple: they want to cultivate their pro-American loyal running dogs to better execute its will, create "two Chinas," and turn Taiwan into its territory like Hawaii. However, I believe you still have patriotic conscience and are unwilling to do this. If someone forces you to do this, then the spark of the Youth Army's uprising in Jiaxing will reignite in Taiwan.
　　Secondly, you may say, "We understand these facts, but is it too late for us to revolt and return now? Can the Chinese Communist Party and the people of the whole country forgive us?" In my opinion, this is a non-issue. Ever since Premier Zhou officially announced the policy of peaceful liberation of Taiwan on behalf of the government at the Second Plenary Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference last year, it has been unanimously supported by the people of the whole country. At the National People's Congress last year, it was further clarified in the spirit of valuing peace, being patriotic as one family, not distinguishing between early and late patriotism, and treating each other with sincerity. In September of the same year, the political report of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China also mentioned this issue. At this CPPCC plenary session, it once again called on "all Chinese with blood to unite in the spirit of patriotism, unite and resist foreign aggression, and smash the conspiracies of American imperialism." And it pointed out: "The US government's attempt to turn Taiwan into a US territory will not only be resolutely opposed by all patriotic Chinese people, but will also not be allowed by all peace-loving countries and people in the world. The trend of Taiwan returning to the embrace of the motherland is irresistible. There is no force in the world that can permanently separate the Chinese from the Chinese." This great spirit of patriotism and the magnanimity of serving the country wholeheartedly have repeatedly sought peaceful solutions to our internal affairs, which cannot but move anyone with a patriotic conscience. The current problem is only waiting for you to wake up, get rid of its control as soon as possible before American imperialism attacks you, resolutely revolt, so that Taiwan can return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible, the motherland can move towards reunification sooner, and the Chinese Communist Party and the people will not only forgive you, but will also warmly welcome you.
　　In the past, Kuomintang military and government personnel who revolted have received the government's trust and arrangements. Like me, I used to be one of the most trusted troops of the Kuomintang - one of the Youth Army generals, and I also did things that I was sorry for the people. But after I recognized the essence of American imperialism's aggression against China and resolutely revolted, I have been cared for and cultivated by the Communist Party. Today, I am able to participate in the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and serve as one of the persons in charge of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference's work group for promoting the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Isn't this a concrete proof? There are also tens of thousands of demobilized officers and soldiers of the Youth Army on the mainland, most of whom are participating in various construction projects of the motherland, some in factories and enterprises, some in government agencies and schools, and some in agricultural production cooperatives. Among them, progressive ones have also joined the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League. Please do not have any doubts.
　　Finally, I would also like to talk about why the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have put forward this policy of peaceful liberation of Taiwan and sincerely and sincerely request peaceful negotiations with you. According to my understanding: First, it is for the sake of resisting foreign aggression together. In the ancient Chinese saying, it is "brothers quarreling at home, defending against external insults." Second, it is to reduce war damage, because once force is used, the property damaged is the property of the Chinese people, and the people who are killed and injured are Chinese. Third, in the past, the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang cooperated twice to oppose common enemies. In these two cooperations, the Northern Expedition and the Anti-Japanese War were victorious. This time, in order to oppose the evil American imperialism, we should restore the historical relationship of the past two cooperations, so as to better defeat our common enemy.
　　Military and government personnel in Taiwan: Many of you are my old friends, and I deeply know that most of you are patriotic. I sympathize with your situation, and I am concerned about your future. I would like to give you sincere advice, hoping that you will break your illusions about the United States, eliminate your concerns about our government, bravely stand on the banner of patriotism, and make beneficial contributions to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

    贾亦斌忠告台湾青年军的官兵打破对美国的幻想
    为和平解放台湾贡献力量
    我听了周总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告，我非常感动。更觉得我们的国家是站起来了。我感到作为一个站起来了的中国人民而自豪，感到伟大祖国的可爱。其中关于和平解放台湾问题，周总理又作了言简意赅的声明，我表示衷心拥护并愿为这个伟大号召而努力。
    现在，请允许我利用这个庄严的讲台，向台湾国民党军政人员特别是对于青年军的官兵们讲几句话。
    首先，要告诉你们：美帝国主义是绝对靠不住的。我所谓靠不住，一方面是说，美帝国主义本身已到垂死阶段，它企图迅速发动第三次大战不太可能；就是发动起来，也只能导致帝国主义更快、更彻底的失败。因为这不仅是力量对比的问题，最根本的是正义与非正义的问题。另一方面是说美帝国主义是在利用和玩弄你们并且随时会抛弃你们的。你们应该记得：自从马歇尔在1946年替国民党政府作了“顽固、自私、无能”六个大字的鉴定后，就在1949年底由美国司徒雷登大使幕后操纵，以李宗仁来代总统，想换换口味试试看。到了你们退到台湾以后，它认为你们更是不行了。就继续在美国豢养李宗仁；在日本培养汉奸廖文毅；在台湾曾大力培植亲美嫡系孙立人和吴国祯；在香港还收容一批什么民主个人主义者。虽然这些人当中，有的是被你们在名义上罢免了，有的是被软禁起来了，有的是被赶出台湾了。但是美帝国主义是不会就此罢手的。如最近积极准备在台湾策动政变，就是很明显的例子。对于青年军更是它集中打击的对象。远在抗日期间，就不肯给青年军新式装备；到了南京，要取消国防部预备干部局，要取消青年军，要把青年军领导权交给孙立人等等，这些事实，都说明美帝国主义对你们的不信任，你们想依靠他们是绝对靠不住的。
    他们为什么这样做？问题很简单就是他们要培养他们亲美嫡系的忠实走狗，更好地执行它的意志，制造“两个中国”，把台湾变成为它的属地和檀香山一样。但是，我相信你们还有爱国良心，是不甘心这样作的。假如有人强迫你们这样做，那青年军过去在嘉兴起义的火种，又会在台湾复燃起来。
    其次，你们也许要说，“这些事实，我们都懂得，但是我们现在起义归来，是否太迟，中国共产党和全国人民是否可以原谅我们呢？”依我看，这是一个不成问题的问题。自从周总理在去年全国政协第二次全体会议上，代表政府正式宣布这个和平解放台湾政策后，获得全国人民一致的拥护。在去年全国人代会上，又进一步本着和为贵、爱国一家，爱国不分先后，相见以诚的精神，再一次明确提出。同年9月，中共第八次代表大会政治报告也提到了这个问题。在这次政协全体会议上再一次号召台湾“一切有血性的中国人，都应该本着爱国一家的精神，团结起来，一致对外，粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋。”并且指出：“美国政府把台湾变成美国属地的企图，不仅将受到一切爱国的中国人民的坚决反对，而且也将为世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民所不许。台湾回到祖国怀抱的大势是不可阻挡的。世界上没有任何力量可以把中国人同中国人永远分割开来。”这种伟大的爱国主义的精神，和公忠体国的恢豁大度，三番四次争取和平解决我国内政问题，只要稍有爱国良心的人，莫不为之感动。现在的问题，只有待于你们幡然觉悟，趁美帝国主义对你们尚未下手之前，从速摆脱它的控制，坚决起义，使台湾早日回到祖国怀抱，祖国早趋统一，中国共产党和人民不仅会原谅你们，而且会热烈欢迎你们的。
    过去起义的国民党军政人员，都得到政府的信任和安排，像我过去曾是国民党最亲信的部队——青年军将领之一，也作过对不起人民的事。但当我认识美帝国主义侵略中国的实质，毅然决然起义以后，一直受到共产党的爱护和培养。今天能够参加全国政协并作为上海市政协促进和平解放台湾工作组负责人之一。这不是一个具体的证明吗？还有现在大陆数以万计的青年军复员官兵，大都参加祖国各项建设工作，有的在工厂、企业；有的在机关、学校；有的在农业生产合作社，其中进步的还参加了共产党和青年团。请你们不要有半点疑虑了。
    最后，我还要说一说，中国共产党和人民政府为什么提出这个和平解放台湾的政策和诚心诚意地要求和你们和平谈判呢？依我的理解：第一、是为了一致对外，用中国的古话说，就是“兄弟阋于墙，外御其侮”。第二、是为了减少战争破坏，因为一旦使用武力，遭破坏的是中国人民的财产，死伤的是中国人。第三、过去中国共产党和国民党为了反对共同敌人，曾经两次合作过，在这两次合作中，使北伐战争和抗日战争都得到胜利。这次为了反对万恶的美帝国主义，应该恢复过去两次合作的历史关系，以期更好地战胜我们共同的敌人。
    台湾军政人员们：你们很多都是我的故旧，我深切知道你们大都是爱国的，我同情你们的处境，我关切你们的前途，特向你们作诚恳的忠告，希望你们打破对美国的幻想，消除对我政府的顾虑，勇敢地站到爱国旗帜下边来，为和平解放台湾作出有益的贡献。
