Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, 8th - Using 0.456 kilograms of coal to generate one kilowatt-hour of electricity is an unprecedented new achievement made by the Fuxin Power Plant in this year's production increase and economy drive. According to the original design, the plant's power generation equipment required 0.52 kilograms of coal to generate one kilowatt-hour of electricity, while the national requirement set for this year is 0.469 kilograms of coal per kilowatt-hour. Due to the reduction in coal consumption rate, the Fuxin Power Plant has already saved more than 3,900 tons of coal in the first two months of this year.

Fuel costs account for 43% of the total cost of the Fuxin Power Plant, and the daily consumption of coal is several thousand tons. Therefore, reducing coal consumption has become an important aspect of the plant's production increase and economy efforts. The workers in the boiler division improved operations, reduced the number of starts and stops of ball mills, stabilized flame combustion, and eliminated black smoke, saving about 40 tons of coal per day.

    阜新发电厂降低煤耗
    用零点四五六公斤煤发一度电
    据新华社阜新8日电　用零点四五六公斤的煤发一度电，这是阜新发电厂在今年的增产节约运动中取得的前所未有的新成绩。按照原设计这个厂的发电设备每发一度电要用零点五二公斤煤，而今年国家提出的要求是零点四六九公斤煤发一度电。由于燃煤率的降低，今年头两个月阜新发电厂已经节省三千九百多吨煤。
    燃料成本占阜新发电厂总成本的43％，每天消耗的煤就有几千吨。因此，降低煤的消耗便成为这个厂增产节约的一项重要内容。锅炉分场的职工，改进操作，减少球磨机起停次数，使火焰燃烧得稳定，消灭了黑烟，每天就节省煤炭四十吨左右。
