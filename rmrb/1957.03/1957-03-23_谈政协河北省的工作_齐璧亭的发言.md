Having listened to Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, I have gained a clear understanding of various issues at home and abroad in my thinking, and I have obtained a correct pointer for my future work. I am very excited! I completely agree with and support the various reports made by Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li, and Vice Chairman Chen, and I express my utmost respect and admiration for Premier Zhou's great achievements and extraordinary hard work during his three-month, 100,000-li journey to visit eleven countries!

Now I would like to express some opinions on the work of the CPPCC:

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is an organization of the Chinese people's democratic united front. As Chairman Mao said, the Chinese people's democratic united front is one of the three magic weapons of the Chinese revolution, and it is the development of Marxism-Leninism in China by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The Chinese people's democratic united front has played a great role in the fierce struggles of the New Democratic Revolution, and it has also exerted its tremendous power in the peaceful struggle of the socialist revolution. In the future, it will still need to play its role in the cause of socialist transformation and socialist construction. Therefore, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as an organization of the Chinese people's democratic united front, will continue to unite and cooperate with various democratic parties, people's organizations, and non-party democratic personages under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and more widely unite and mobilize the people of all ethnic groups in the country to work together, overcome difficulties, and strive to build a great socialist country.

　　Major Achievements in Work

Specifically in our province, the CPPCC Hebei Provincial Committee, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the guidance of the CPPCC National Committee, has done some work in accordance with this policy in recent years and has achieved some results. The following three items are selected for your reference:

    I. In 1956, under the new situation of the victories in socialist transformation and socialist construction, our united front team expanded. CPPCC organizations at the city and county levels throughout the province have been successively established or expanded. As of February this year, CPPCC committees have been established in eleven cities and thirty counties, and will continue to increase in the future. The number of CPPCC members in various cities and counties has also expanded by one-third to more than doubled compared with the past. When holding plenary meetings in various places, a considerable number of democratic people are invited to attend and participate. As for our provincial CPPCC committee, when it held a plenary meeting last spring, the number of members increased from more than 150 to more than 270, and more than 200 people were invited to attend the meeting. Such a rapid expansion of the united front team is indeed inspired by the victory of the socialist revolution, which has prompted everyone to step forward and move towards socialism; and the reason why the socialist revolution has achieved rapid victory is inseparable from the role of the united front, that is, the work of political consultation. In this way, mutually causal, from victory to victory, our journey towards a socialist society will be greatly shortened, and the beautiful prospects of a socialist society will be just around the corner; and we cannot but thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for their wise and correct leadership, and their compassionate hearts for the happiness of mankind!

    II. In order to strengthen the political and theoretical study of democratic personages and industrialists and businessmen from all walks of life, in accordance with the regulations of the National Committee, we established an amateur political university in the second half of last year, with three branches: CPPCC, Medical College, and Agricultural College. The automatic registration was very enthusiastic, and the three schools admitted more than 700 students. After the start of classes, the enthusiasm for learning was very high, and the students of each branch rarely missed classes; even in the severe winter and snowy days, old students in their sixties and seventies still came through the snow, worried about missing classes, which was really moving! In the study group discussions, the speeches were also very enthusiastic. Some combined their own work to conduct analysis and criticism, and some also used a materialist point of view to examine their own idealist thinking. Therefore, through half a year of study, it has played a great role in improving the ideological understanding of people from all walks of life. In addition, a political school for industrialists and businessmen was established, and the effect was also very significant.

    III. In order to expand and strengthen the united front with various democratic parties, our provincial CPPCC has done its best to help them establish organizations and develop party members, especially the former. Under the encouragement of the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic National Construction Association, the China Democratic League, and the Jiusan Society have successively established provincial organizations, and the China Association for Promoting Democracy will soon begin preparations. In the future, the various parties will join hands and fight side by side, which will surely play a huge role in the united front work of the entire province, and our provincial CPPCC will be closely united with them and cooperate together.

Now, let me talk about my opinions on the work of the CPPCC at the city and county levels in our province:

The CPPCC organizations have been established in eleven cities and thirty counties in our province. According to the reports from the responsible persons in various places and the situation we have seen during our inspections in various places, the CPPCC in various places has played a great role in organizing learning and negotiating to solve local problems. In addition, several counties have done a very good job in discovering intellectuals, which is very worthy of promotion. For example, the vice chairman of the CPPCC in Shulu County said in his report that the county discovered 53 old intellectuals in the past year, including old juren, old linsheng, old xiucai, old teachers, as well as old Chinese medicine doctors and old college students, all of whom were buried in towns and villages, silenced and disappeared, and dared not show themselves; after being discovered, they initially did not dare to talk about the past history, and later explained the party and government's policy of uniting intellectuals, and gave them newspapers, periodicals, and Premier Zhou's report on the issue of intellectuals, which gradually changed fear and suspicion into comfort and emotion. One old man finally said: "A conversation at a forum is better than reading books for ten years. I now understand what kind of world this is. I will not live in vain and waste time from now on." Another example is an old Chinese medicine doctor in Jixian County, who has always had a sense of resistance to the socialist system. After being contacted and united, he said with a smile: "I am willing to move a brick for the construction of socialism in the future." Also, when comrades of our association went to Chengde City for inspection, they discovered that a cart driver was a former university graduate. After informing the local CPPCC, they transferred the matter to the local government for prompt work arrangements.

From this point of view, there are a large number of old intellectuals hidden in the society, and they should be quickly discovered, united, educated, transformed, and properly placed, so as to give full play to their intelligence and serve the socialist construction. Therefore, we must follow the methods of the National Committee, establish local work committees, strengthen contact with the CPPCC in various cities and counties, and help them to not only organize learning and conduct consultation work, but also try their best to discover old intellectuals in various regions. If the work progresses smoothly, within a year, the entire province will be able to discover more than 1,000 or more hidden old intellectuals. Such transformation of negativity into positivity, and expansion of the ranks of intellectuals, will add much strength to our country's socialist transformation and socialist construction. Chairman Mao said: "Unite all possible forces at home and abroad to strive for the construction of a great socialist China." We should quickly follow through.

　　Two Suggestions

Finally, I would like to make two suggestions:

    1. As mentioned earlier, political consultation is an important work to promote the advancement of socialist transformation and socialist construction. If some cities and counties have not paid attention to this work, because for the CPPCC city and county organizations, only one full-time cadre is assigned, or even not a single full-time cadre, and one cadre is drawn from the city and county people's committee to take care of it for a short time. Even if there is a full-time cadre in the CPPCC, he is often drawn away due to the busy central work of the city and county, thus making the regular work of the CPPCC fall into stagnation. Furthermore, some cities and counties lack leadership in the work of the CPPCC, which makes cadres not know where to start their work. Again, the city and county CPPCC often lack houses. Some places only allocate one or two houses to the CPPCC, or share offices with a certain department of the government, which makes it impossible to receive the masses and carry out consultation work. It is hoped that the National Committee will conduct investigation and research on this situation and make principled regulations on the establishment, funding, etc. of local CPPCCs, so that there is something to follow.

    2. Some local governments do not fully appreciate the role and benefits of political consultation, and rarely submit important local measures and policies and regulations related to the interests of the masses for consultation, or even fail to consult, so that the CPPCC's work cannot play its due role. Also, some departments of local governments are slow to reply to the proposals and suggestions of CPPCC members after they are reflected, or reply hastily, and are not in line with the facts. This is obviously contrary to the spirit of the government listening to the opinions of the masses and improving its work. It is hoped that the State Council will instruct local governments to pay attention to this.

Please give your advice on whether the above opinions are appropriate!

In addition, what I talked about today about the work of the CPPCC in Hebei Province includes some of our achievements and some of our shortcomings. This is a speech that reports both good and bad news. I believe that only reporting good news and not bad news can easily make people overly optimistic, so that they blindly rush forward regardless of whether the conditions are sufficient or whether the environment is good. Only reporting bad news and not good news can easily make people overly worried, so that they are tied up and hesitant to move forward. This is all detrimental to the country's construction. Chairman Mao gave instructions on the country's economic construction, "Overall planning, taking all factors into consideration, and appropriate arrangements." I think this policy can also be applied to psychological construction. That is, we must both be joyful and encouraged, and move forward bravely, breaking down conservative ideas, and also be forward-looking and cautious and thorough, eliminating the tendency of rash advance. In short, we must achieve a balance of joy, sorrow, and happiness in our psychology, so that we can seek appropriate priorities in our careers. I think this is what responsible comrades in all departments should pay attention to.

Secondly, what I said above, that the government listens to the opinions of the masses, is a manifestation of our country's democratic policy. I heard Committee Member Zhou Jianren say at the Supreme State Conference that Confucius's saying "The people can be made to follow, but cannot be made to know" is not in line with the current democratic policy (the general idea is like this, I don't remember the original words). But before the 1911 Revolution, I heard someone say that Confucius also advocated democracy. He said that this sentence was wrongly punctuated by Zhu Xi and annotated in the opposite way. This sentence was originally divided into three paragraphs, not two. That is: "The people can be made to follow; let them not be left unguided; make them understand." In today's words: "The people can be made to follow" means "mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses," "let them not be left unguided" means not "extreme democracy and excessive freedom," and "make them understand" means "carrying out propaganda and education and implementing democratic centralism." This was said by progressive people who advocated democratic revolution before the 1911 Revolution. Whether it is in line with Confucius's original intention, please study it with the attitude of "a hundred schools of thought contending!"

Finally, when I participated in the second plenary meeting of the second session of this committee last year, because it was in a new situation of victory in the socialist revolution, the members were excited and proposed age indicators in order to extend their working years and serve social construction more. I have not heard any speeches in this regard in the past few days of this meeting. I am very strange in my heart. Could it be that the plan set last year was a bit rash, and this year you have secretly revised it and are unwilling to explain it at the conference? Therefore, I questioned Committee Member Hu Shuhua, and Committee Member Hu said with a smile: "Last year, the indicators were set in competition with Committee Members Liang Sicheng and Chen Heqin." Understanding his meaning is: The indicators have been set, that is, they are carried out accordingly, and there is no need to say more. On the 14th of this month, Committee Member Ke Huang spoke, explaining the truth that "it is not rare for people to live to seventy," and describing everyone's mood of "thriving and not knowing that old age is coming." This is completely in line with the facts. There are more than ten people over the age of 80, dozens of people over the age of 70, and more over the age of 60 who participated in this conference. These people all look energetic and healthy, and can continue to work for the country for several years. This shows that in the new country and new society under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, it is possible to prolong life and increase work efficiency. I am 74 years old this year. Last year, at the plenary meeting of the CPPCC in Hebei Province, I also announced my first 12-year and second 15-year fitness, learning, and work plan, which is to plan to work and study until I am 100 years old, and hope to overfulfill the plan without completing it ahead of schedule.

Here, I suggest that the National Committee establish a Democratic Seniors Federation to strengthen the leadership of the health, work, and learning of senior democratic people across the country, and compete with the All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Women's Federation. I recommend Vice Chairman Chen Shutong to serve concurrently as the chairman of the Democratic Seniors Federation. I heard that Vice Chairman Chen is already 82 years old this year, but his voice is clear and his words are clear when he speaks, and every word comes from his dantian. It is not a problem for him to live to 120 years old. I also recommend Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, and Shen Junru to serve concurrently as the vice chairmen of the Seniors Federation. I talked with Vice Chairman Huang Yanpei twice in 1917 and 1938 at the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association and the Tianjin Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, respectively. He is now fatter and stronger than those two periods, and can be said to be "old and strong." Moreover, his voice is like a Hong Zhong, and his words have all intonations and pauses, which further proves that he has sufficient energy. I heard that after he was 70 years old, his wife gave birth to a little baby, of course, this was before the call for family planning. Looking at this situation, it is not a problem for him to live to 150 years old. The remaining Vice Chairmen Li and Shen can also live to 120 years old or more.

Now I wish: All the elderly people in the country, headed by Chairman Mao, will have increasing health! The socialist construction of our country will be completed successfully! (Attached picture)

### 谈政协河北省的工作　齐璧亭的发言

　　谈政协河北省的工作
　　齐璧亭的发言
    我听了毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话，使我对国内外发生的各种问题，在思想上有了明确的认识，在今后工作上得到正确的指针，我十分兴奋！听了周总理、李副总理及陈副主席的各项报告，我完全同意和拥护，并对周总理历时三阅月，旅程十万里，访问十一国，所得伟大的成就，所受非凡的辛劳，表示十分钦敬和感动！
    现在我就政协工作发表一点意见：
    中国人民政治协商会议是中国人民民主统一战线的组织。中国人民民主统一战线，如毛主席所说是中国人民革命的三大法宝之一，是中国共产党、毛主席对于马列主义在中国的发展。中国人民民主统一战线在新民主主义革命的剧烈斗争中，已经起到了它的伟大作用，在社会主义革命的和平奋斗中，也发挥了它的巨大力量，今后在社会主义改造和社会主义建设的事业中，还仍然需要发挥它的作用。因此，作为一个中国人民民主统一战线组织的中国人民政治协商会议，将继续在中国共产党的领导下，通过与各民主党派、人民团体和无党派民主人士的团结与合作，更广泛地团结和动员全国各族人民共同努力，克服困难，为建设一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。
　　工作上的主要成绩
    具体到我省来说，我们政协河北省委员会在中国共产党的领导和政协全国委员会的指导下，几年来本着这个方针作了一些工作，并取得一些成绩。今择要举出以下三项，供各位参考：
    一、1956年在社会主义改造和社会主义建设取得胜利的新形势下，我们统一战线的队伍扩大了。全省各市县陆续建立或扩大政协组织，截至今年2月止，已成立政协委员会的有十一市、三十县，今后尚继续增加。各市县政协委员的人数亦较前扩充了三分之一至一倍以上，各地召开全体会议时并邀请相当数目的民主人士列席参加。至于我们省政协委员会于去年春举行全体会议时，委员人数由一百五十余人增加到二百七十余人，并邀请了二百余人列席会议。像这样统一战线队伍的急剧扩大，的确是受了社会主义革命胜利的鼓舞，使大家挺身而起向社会主义迈进；而社会主义革命之所以迅速取得胜利，又与统一战线的作用，也就是政治协商的工作分不开的。如此，互为因果，由胜利导向胜利，我们向社会主义社会迈进的里程将大大缩短，社会主义社会的美好远景将指日可待；而饮水思源不能不感谢共产党毛主席的英明而正确的领导，和为人类谋幸福的慈心！
    二、为了加强各界民主人士和工商业者的政治及理论学习，我们本着全国委员会的规定，于去年下半年成立了业余政治大学，分设了政协、医学院、农学院三个分校；自动报名参加的非常踊跃，三校共收学员七百余人。开课后，学习情绪甚为高涨，各分校学员甚少缺课；甚至在严冬风雪之天，六、七十岁的老学员仍踏雪前来，担心误课，实令人感动！在学习小组讨论时，发言亦甚热烈，有的结合自己的工作进行了分析批判，有的还以唯物主义的观点检查了自己唯心主义的思想。因此，通过半年的学习，对各界人士思想认识的提高，起了很大的作用。此外，并成立了工商业者政治学校，效果亦甚显著。
    三、为扩大和加强与各民主党派的联合阵线，对于它们建立组织，发展党员，特别是前者，我省政协均尽全力帮助进行。在“长期共存，互相监督”方针的鼓舞下，现民革、民建、民盟、九三已相继成立了省组织，民进不久即进行筹备。将来各党派携手前进，并肩作战，对于全省统战工作，必起到巨大的作用，我省政协则与它们紧密团结，共同合作。
    现就我省市县政协工作，说说我的意见：
    我省十一市三十县已建立政协组织，根据各地负责人的汇报及我们到各地视察的情形来看，各地方政协对于组织学习，协商解决地方问题，均起了很大的作用。此外有几县对发现知识分子工作，作的很好，很值得推广。如束鹿县政协副主席在汇报时说，该县于去年一年中即发现了旧知识分子五十三名，其中有老举人、老廪生、老秀才、老教书先生以及老中医、旧大学生等，均埋没在城镇及乡村，消声匿迹，不敢有所表现；经发现后，最初尚不敢谈过去历史，后与说明党和政府团结知识分子的政策，并赠阅报章、刊物及周总理关于知识分子问题的报告，才渐渐变恐惧、怀疑为安慰、感动。有一老人最后说：“座谈一席话，胜读十年书，我现在才明白这是个甚么世界，我从此不白活着消磨时光了”。又如有冀县的一个老中医，一向是对社会主义制度存有抵触心理的，经与联系、团结后，笑着说：“我今后愿为建筑社会主义搬一块砖”。又我会同志赴承德市视察时，发现一个赶大车的是个以往的大学毕业生，经告知当地政协，即转请当地政府迅予安排工作。
    由此看来，社会上潜藏的旧知识分子为数甚多，极应迅速发掘出来，予以团结、教育、改造和适当安置，以发挥其智能为社会主义建设服务。因此，我们要仿照全国委员会的办法，成立地方工作委员会，加强与各市县政协的联系，帮助他们除组织学习，进行协商工作外，并尽量发掘各地区的旧知识分子。如进行顺利，一年之内，全省将可发现潜藏的旧知识分子一千人以上或更多。像这样化消极为积极，扩大知识分子的队伍，对于我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业将增加许多力量。毛主席说：“团结国内外一切可能团结的力量，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义的中国而奋斗”。我们应迅速遵照实行。
　　两点建议
    最后，我提出两点建议：
    1．如前边所谈，政治协商是推动社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业前进的一项重要工作，如有的市县尚未把这项工作重视起来，因为对政协市县组织，只分派专职干部一人，甚至连一个专职干部也没有，而由市县人民委员会抽派干部一人前往作短时间的照顾。即有专职干部的政协，又时常因市县的中心工作忙，而把他抽走，因而使政协经常工作陷于停顿。再则有的市县对政协工作领导不足，致使干部对工作不知从何处下手。再次则市县政协往往缺少房屋，有的地方只分配政协房屋一二间，或与政府的某科合室办公，致无法接待群众，进行协商工作。这种情况希望全国委员会加以调查研究，对于地方政协的编制、经费等作出原则上的规定，以便有所遵循。
    2．有些地方政府对于政治协商的作用及效益体会不够，对于地方性的重要措施及与群众利害有关的政策法令，很少提交协商，甚至不予协商，致政协工作不能发挥应有的作用。又地方政府有的部门对于政协委员之提案和建议经反映后，迟迟不复，或草率答复，而与事实不相符合。这与政府倾听群众意见、改进工作的精神，显有抵触。希望国务院指示地方政府予以注意。
    以上各种意见是否有当，请各位委员加以指教！
    此外，我今天所谈的河北省政协工作，有的是我们一点成绩，有的是我们一些缺点。这是一个报喜也报忧的发言。我认为只报喜不报忧，容易使人过分乐观，以致不管条件够不够，不看环境好不好，一味盲目冒进。只报忧不报喜，又容易使人过分顾虑，以致束手束脚，徘徊不前。这全是对国家建设不利的。毛主席对国家经济建设，指示“统筹兼顾，适当安排”的方针。我以为这个方针也可以应用在心理建设方面。那就是既要欢欣鼓舞，勇往向前，打破保守思想，又要瞻前顾后，审慎周详，免除冒进倾向。总之，必须在心理上达到忧喜悲欢的平衡，才能在事业上求得轻重缓急的适当。我想这是各部门负责同志均应该注意的。
    其次，我上边所说，政府倾听群众的意见，这是我国民主政策的一种表现。在最高国务会议上听见周建人委员讲，孔子所说“民可使由之，不可使知之”是与现在的民主政策不相符合的（大意如此，原话我记不清了）。但我在辛亥革命之前，听见有人讲，孔子也是主张民主的。他这话被朱熹断错了句，给注解反了。这句话原来分三段，不是两段。那就是：“民可使，由之不可，使知之”。拿现在的话来说：“民可使”，就是“动员群众、依靠群众”的意思，“由之不可”，就是不要“极端民主、过分自由”的意思，“使知之”就是“进行宣传教育、实行民主集中”的意思。这是在辛亥前进步人士鼓吹民主革命的时候说的，是否与孔子的原意相合，请诸位以“百家争鸣”的态度，加以考究！
    最后，我去年参加本会二届二次全体会议的时候，因为正处在社会主义革命胜利的新形势之下，各位委员精神兴奋，纷纷提出年龄指标，以便延长工作年限，多为社会建设服务。这次开会，前几天未听见对这方面的发言，我心中很奇怪，莫不是各位因为去年所定计划冒进了些，今年暗自修正，不愿在大会上说明吗？因此我就向胡庶华委员质问，胡委员笑着说：“去年是与梁思成、陈鹤琴两委员竞赛，而定的指标”。体会他的意思，是：指标已定，即按照进行，不必再说了。本月14日柯璜委员发言，说明“人生七十今不稀”的道理，并描述大家“欣欣向荣，不知老之将至”的心情。这完全是与事实相符合的。这次参加会议的，八十岁以上的十余人，七十岁以上的数十人，六十岁以上的更多。这些人看起来全是精神奕奕，身体康健，全能继续为国家工作若干年。这说明在中国共产党领导下的新国家、新社会中，是能延年益寿、增加工作效力的。我今年七十四岁，去年在河北省政协全体会议上也宣布了我的头一段十二年、第二段十五年的健身、学习和工作的计划，就是计划工作、学习到一百岁，并希望超额完成计划，而不提前完成。
    在这里，我建议全国委员会，成立一个民主老年联谊会，以加强对全国老年民主人士健康、工作及学习的领导，并与全国民主青联、民主妇联作竞赛。我推荐陈叔通副主席兼任民主老联的主席。我听说陈副主席今年已到八十二岁的高龄，但他讲话时声音清脆，字句明晰，字字从丹田发出，享寿到一百二十岁，不成问题。我并推荐李济深、黄炎培、沈钧儒各位副主席兼任老联的副主席。我与黄炎培副主席于1917和1938年分别在江苏省教育会和天津抗日救国会谈过两次话，他现在比那两个时期胖壮多了，可说是“老当益壮”。而且他说话声如鸿钟，字句全有抑仰顿挫，更可证他精力充足。听说他在七十岁以后，他的夫人还生过一个小娃娃，当然这是在号召节育以前的事。看这情况，他享寿到一百五十岁，也不成问题。其余李、沈两副主席也均能享寿到百二十岁或更多。
    现在祝：以毛主席为首的全国老人，健康日增！我国社会主义建设事业，胜利完成！（附图片）
