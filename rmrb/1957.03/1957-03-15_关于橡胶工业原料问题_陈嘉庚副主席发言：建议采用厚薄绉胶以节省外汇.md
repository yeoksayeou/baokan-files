On the Issue of Raw Materials for the Rubber Industry
Chen Jiageng, Vice Chairman, Speaks: Suggests Using Thick and Thin Crepe Rubber to Save Foreign Exchange

The other day, I spoke at the Supreme State Council meeting about the Ministry of Chemical Industry and the Shanghai Rubber Factory testing rubber. Due to time constraints, I could not elaborate. I will now provide further details:

I. This century is the age of rubber, and mankind's material progress is inseparable from rubber. In the 19th century, there was natural rubber in the forests of Indonesia. The local people would often organize small teams, prepare dry rations, and carry weapons to collect rubber. Upon finding mature rubber trees deep in the mountains and forests, they would cut them down and let the rubber sap flow onto the ground. When their food was about to run out, they would collect the solidified rubber from the ground and sell it to overseas Chinese in the cities. The overseas Chinese merchants in Singapore would then process it, each piece weighing two or three pounds, and the color was purplish-red. They would sell it to foreign merchants for transshipment to Europe, at a price of seven or eight hundred yuan per hundred pounds. The annual output was less than 10,000 tons. At that time, automobiles had not yet been invented, and it was mostly used to wrap submarine cables, so sales were not widespread.

II. At the end of the 19th century, a type of rubber currently in use was produced in the mountains of Panama in South America. Villagers took its seeds and planted them nearby. After they grew, it was profitable to extract rubber, and the government encouraged people to plant it and forbade the export of seeds. Later, the British managed to purchase three hundred seeds and planted one hundred each in Ceylon, Malaya, and Singapore. Within ten years, they grew lush and abundant, with a rich yield of rubber. However, the local governments did not actively encourage residents to plant it. Although overseas Chinese engaged in cultivation, each garden was mostly less than a hundred mu. About forty years ago, automobiles were manufactured. An agricultural expert from England came to Singapore and told the overseas Chinese Lin Wenqing that rubber would have extensive uses in the future, and British businessmen would organize companies to establish rubber plantations in Singapore. Each plantation would need to be at least one thousand acres (each acre equals 6.6 Chinese mu). He advised Mr. Lin to raise capital to operate it, stating that there would be substantial profits. Mr. Lin then recruited Chen Qixian, an overseas Chinese from Malacca, to apply to the local government for 5,000 mu of mountain land. After operating for about five years and planting 2,000 mu, with an investment of no more than 200,000 yuan, he sold it to a British company for 2 million yuan. Overseas Chinese in Singapore and Malaya followed suit, competing to plant rubber. Locals and the British also planted it, increasing the planting area by no less than 100,000 mu each year. Therefore, this type of rubber is called Panama rubber.

III. After World War I in 1918, rubber prices plummeted. The British colonial government restricted each rubber plantation from reducing production, and rubber prices immediately recovered. The Dutch East Indies government ordered residents to plant as much rubber as possible near their residences, with penalties for violators. Consequently, Indonesian rubber was mostly planted scattered in villages, and due to inconvenient transportation, collective cooperation was impossible. They lacked the equipment for rollers and smoking rooms to produce smoked sheets. Each household only used wooden tools or glass bottles to roll out the moisture in the rubber, each sheet about two feet long, over a foot wide, and two inches thick, still containing about 10% moisture, called wet sheets. Overseas Chinese peddlers would collect them door-to-door, tie them into bundles with rattan, and transport them to the city in more than ten days. If transshipped to Singapore, it would take even more days. During the journey, the surface color would change to yellowish-brown due to wind and sun exposure, but the original color would still remain when cut open. After entering the factory, workers would sort them according to color and place them in steel rollers for tens of minutes, rotating hundreds of times per minute, with continuous flowing water for washing (it's difficult to roll without water). If some sand or dirt was mixed in during transportation, it would have been crushed and washed away completely. It takes a long time to roll and mix to make the colors uniform, and after it is made, each strip is more than a foot wide, three or four tenths of an inch thick, and about twenty feet long, weighing ten or twenty pounds. It is hung in a hot steam room, and it takes about thirty days and nights to dry, which is called thick crepe rubber. Such raw material wet sheets also existed in Malaya in the beginning, but later they were all converted to smoked sheets.

IV. Another type is called thin crepe rubber, which is an essential product of each rubber plantation. Its raw materials are rubber threads and rubber balls. Rubber threads are the rubber latex that congeals from the cut on the rubber tree. Rubber balls are made by concentrating the rubber latex and filtering it through a copper wire mesh, and the rubber that does not pass through is scooped into balls by hand. When sold, it no longer contains moisture. These two types account for slightly more than one-tenth of the rubber production. Merchants collect them and sell them to rubber factories to make thin crepe rubber. The production method is the same as that of thick crepe rubber. However, each strip weighs only four or five pounds and is divided into three or four different colors. There is a specially made patterned type called hairy knife crepe. I used to operate thick and thin crepe rubber sales to Europe and the United States for more than thirty years. Sometimes I had to compensate for incorrect numbers, but I never had to compensate for a single penny for so-called sand or impurities. The compensation example is based on the evidence from the specialized company there.

V. I previously operated a rubber products factory in Singapore, manufacturing tires, boots, shoes, clothing, medical equipment, and many other products. Some told me that I should specialize in manufacturing three or two types of products, as it would be easier to achieve precision and quality. I was aware of this, but my intention was to promote the experience of producing various types of products, not solely for the purpose of profit. Considering that Japan, a small country, had more than 400 rubber products factories, while our country had none, I adopted a diversified approach to my factory's products to serve as a demonstration. The chemical laboratory was well-equipped, and the manufacturing methods of the finished products were not kept secret but disclosed to the employees. At that time, thick and thin crepe rubber were cheaper than smoked sheets, although not as much as in recent years. During my ten years of operation, I usually employed thousands of workers, and thick and thin crepe rubber accounted for more than 90% of the rubber used. Smoked sheets were rarely used, except for inner tubes and fine and soft products.

VI. In 1950, Huang Yanpei, also a minister, convened a national conference of more than 400 rubber factories and invited me to report on the rubber situation in Southeast Asia. I raised the issue of the losses incurred by not using thick and thin crepe rubber. At that time, the monthly rubber consumption was more than 4,000 tons. Soon after, the embargo occurred, and I did not bring up this proposal again. Last summer, Singapore and Malaya lifted the embargo. I immediately wrote to Premier Zhou and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, detailing the losses incurred by not using thick and thin crepe rubber. I also cited the Singapore rubber prices from January to April, where crepe rubber was, on average, 300 yuan cheaper per ton than smoked sheets. I also informed them that the production of synthetic rubber was increasing daily, and the price of smoked sheets would inevitably become more expensive. The current rubber consumption has increased significantly compared to before. If crepe rubber is still not used, there will be even greater losses in foreign exchange. In the second half of the year, the price of smoked sheets even increased by more than 400 yuan per ton compared to crepe rubber.

VII. Last October, I came to Beijing to establish the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. The Singapore and Malaya Industrial and Trade Delegation was meeting in Beijing at the same time. They said that they had concluded a deal for 7,000 tons of smoked rubber sheets, but that crepe rubber was unsuitable and no one was willing to buy it. I was very puzzled. Three months ago, I had suggested to the government and the two organs of the National People's Congress, but there was no effect. Zhuang Yisheng, a shareholder and manager of the Shanghai Joint State-Private Zhongnan Rubber Factory, came to Beijing to attend the conference of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and told me about the losses incurred by the government not using crepe rubber. I planned to send a letter to Singapore requesting the shipment of some thick and thin crepe rubber for your factory to test. Mr. Zhuang expressed great support, but he needed to obtain the consent of Director Zhou of the Shanghai Second Light Industry Bureau first. He went to Shanghai with me to meet with Director Zhou, who agreed. I immediately sent a letter to two rubber companies in Singapore, requesting each to ship some thick and thin crepe rubber to the Shanghai Zhongnan Rubber Factory for testing.

VIII. In mid-December, I received a letter from the National People's Congress, enclosing the Ministry of Chemical Industry's response to my suggestion as follows: (1) Crepe sheets have low strength; (2) High abrasion; (3) Contain more impurities, especially more sand; (4) Low fixed tensile strength; (5) Dark and unattractive color, finished products may be difficult to sell, the Ministry of Commerce should consider this; (6) Not suitable for tire production. Based on this, it seems that crepe rubber is definitely not suitable. But what is puzzling is, if crepe rubber is not suitable, let alone my more than ten years of experience in manufacturing rubber products, why has Europe and the United States used crepe rubber for forty or fifty years, with annual sales increasing from tens of thousands of tons to hundreds of thousands of tons? If not used for making tires and other finished products, what would it be used for? Furthermore, as an example, a factory at Geylang Bridge in Singapore is set up by "Firestone," a famous American tire company. It specializes in manufacturing thick and thin crepe rubber for its own use in that country, not as a merchant selling it.

IX. The raw materials used in rubber products, except for cloth and tire inner tubes which mostly use rubber, about 40% are rubber, and about 60% are white clay and various chemical materials, about half each. Suppose that crepe rubber does contain 1/1000 of sand or dirt powder, what does it matter to the finished products? It is even more meaningless to say that the color is dark and difficult to sell. For example, car inner tubes are mostly red, and other rubber products come in all colors. If they are painted black, how can they be made red, white, and other colors? The main thing is the color pigment added. If the worst crepe rubber needs to be added four or five pounds to be the same as smoked sheets, it can increase the volume of the finished product to compensate. The fact is not entirely a sacrifice.

X. There are currently three types of rubber used in the world. Two types of natural rubber, about two million tons per year, and one type of synthetic rubber, about one million tons. Of the two types of natural rubber, smoked sheets account for 1.3-1.4 million tons, and crepe rubber accounts for 600,000-700,000 tons. The quality of rubber is best with smoked sheets, followed by crepe rubber, and then synthetic rubber. Crepe rubber can be used alone. If it is of lower quality, four or five pounds can be added per hundred pounds, and its function will be the same as that of smoked sheets. Synthetic rubber cannot be used alone and must be mixed with smoked rubber to manufacture items. In the past ten years, the production of synthetic rubber has increased sharply, so the sales of smoked rubber have become more widespread and the value has increased. Our country has no synthetic rubber and does not use crepe rubber. We specialize in using expensive smoked rubber as the raw material for various products. It is inevitable that we will suffer greater and greater losses when competing with the world that has synthetic rubber.

XI. The two rubber companies in Singapore, Yick Hoe and Nam Yick, sent four types of thick and thin crepe rubber to the Shanghai Zhongnan Rubber Factory in December of last year upon receiving my letter. Director Zhou and Mr. Zhuang then distributed them to Shanghai Dachina, Zhengtai, Lianyee, and other factories, including Zhongnan, a total of eight factories, for testing and research. They conducted segmented and detailed experiments multiple times. After each test, they held meetings to discuss the chemical properties and physical functions. After sixty days, the results obtained were good in the first two reports, but the third was not available at the time.

XII. I believe that the chemists responsible for rubber manufacturing should not only know the quality and performance of rubber but also know the prices of various rubbers and the relevant materials used in the products. Among them, the price change is especially the most important for rubber. The distribution is calculated to achieve the effect of good quality and reduced cost. Now, the rubber factories in our country are either state-owned or joint state-private. The selling price of the products is determined by state-owned commercial organizations. There is no competition from private merchants. Although the cost is high, the patents are still in our hands. Therefore, the general industry pursues quality or does not hesitate to transfer the loss of labor and capital to the people. However, the loss of the people ultimately belongs to the government. For example, each pair of cloth rubber shoes sells for six or seven yuan. If someone competed to sell them, they could be reduced by half. This is only in the domestic scope. If we talk about the international market, we cannot compete with others because we do not know the price of goods, or even the cheaper raw materials commonly used in the world.

XIII. Among the thick and thin crepe rubber factories in Southeast Asia, Singapore accounts for about 40%, and Malaya, Indonesia, and Thailand account for about 60%. Since liberation, I have not heard of thick and thin crepe rubber being shipped from Singapore to our country. As for the rubber factories in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, Yick Hoe and Nam Yick companies in Singapore account for 80-90% of the output, and I have not heard of thick and thin crepe rubber being shipped to our country. This time, the Ministry of Chemical Industry's response that I proved crepe rubber is unsuitable, is it thick or thin, where was it shipped from, in what year and month, was it a product that failed, or was it tested outside the factory by many factories or just a few people?

The Ministry of Chemical Industry believes that thick and thin crepe rubber is unsuitable because it contains sand and impurities. This is a case of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. The raw materials for rubber products, in addition to rubber accounting for about 40%, the other 60% are mostly white clay and debris. But factories in Shanghai and other places believe that it can be used after testing. Their views are different, but whether it is suitable or unsuitable has a significant impact on the gains and losses of foreign exchange, amounting to hundreds of millions of yuan per month. Since it does not trust that Southeast Asia produces thick and thin crepe rubber every year and sells hundreds of thousands of tons to Europe and the United States, and almost all of them are operated by overseas Chinese, why not first buy some thick and thin crepe rubber and hand it over to the factories to make daily necessities for practical experiments, but only rely on the judgment of chemists, which is a bit too rash. Now, if the government agrees to practical and material experiments, I am willing to provide 30,000 yuan in foreign exchange to purchase 16 tons of thick and thin crepe rubber from Singapore and hand it over to famous factories in Shanghai to manufacture the most popular daily necessities. Use 10 tons to make 1,000 large and small car tires, use 3 tons to make 4,000-5,000 rickshaw tires, and use 3 tons to make more than 10,000 pairs of shoes. After the finished products (except car tires, which take a month) are used for two months, success or failure will be immediately apparent.

XIV. Premier Zhou specially convened the Standing Committee at the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference last year, announcing that the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is consultative in nature. Now, to solicit opinions widely, it is necessary to treat the proposals of the State Council and the National People's Congress with the same importance, jointly study them, carefully consider them, and provide a practical response to whether or not to implement the proposed measures, or how to handle them. If there are any dissatisfactions, feel free to send a letter for explanation, and we will never let down the intentions of the proposer.

Premier Zhou's great humility, valuing the opinions of the masses, gathering wisdom and benefiting from good ideas, has made a deep impression on me. Therefore, I dare to boldly state the above. As for the responses of the various responsible departments to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, I still hope that they will examine and criticize them and give correct instructions.

    关于橡胶工业原料问题
    陈嘉庚副主席发言：建议采用厚薄绉胶以节省外汇
    前日我在最高国务会议讲化学工业部、和上海制胶厂化验橡胶事，为时间关系不能多说，兹补述如下：
    一、现世纪为橡胶时代，人类物质进步与橡胶分不开的。十九世纪时印尼森林内有天然胶橡，土人常组织小队，预备干粮携带武器前往取胶。寻到山林深处遇有成长胶橡即砍倒，任胶液流地上，及粮将尽，沿途收取地上凝胶到城市售于华侨。再转新加坡侨商修整，每块重二三斤，色系紫红售于洋商转运欧洲，每百斤价七八百元，年产量不及万吨，许时汽车尚未发明，多用以包海底电线，故销路不广。
    二、十九世纪末南美巴拿马山内产有现用这种橡胶，村民取其种子种于近处，成长后取胶有利，政府又鼓励人民栽种，并禁止种子出口。后英人设法购得种子三百粒，分种于锡兰马来亚新加坡各一百粒。十年间成长畅茂，胶量丰富，但当地政府不甚鼓励居民栽种，华侨虽有经营，每园多不及百亩，距今五十余年始制有汽车。有农业专家英人来游新加坡，告华侨林文庆以橡胶此后用途甚大，英商人将组织公司在新加坡辟置胶园。每园面积至少须一千英亩（每英亩等于华亩六亩六），劝林君招股经营定有厚利，林君乃招马六甲埠侨生陈齐贤向当地政府请山地五千亩。经营五年前后种植二千亩，投资不上二十万元，即转售英商某公司二百万元。新马华侨闻风继起，竞争种植，土人英人亦有栽种，每年增种面积不下十余万亩。故此种胶称巴拿马胶之由来也。
    三、1918年世界大战后胶价跌落，英殖民地政府限制各胶园减少生产，胶价立即回复。荷印政府下令居民各住地尽量种胶违者科罚。由是印尼橡胶多散植于乡村，加以交通不便，不能集体合作，无辗机烟房之设备以制烟片。各家只用木具或玻璃瓶辗去胶中水分，每片长约二尺，阔尺余，厚二寸不等，尚含有一成左右水分，名为湿片。华侨贩客到门收购，用藤结缚成捆，经十多日运到城市，如转运新加坡又加多少日。在途经风日吹晒，表面色泽变为黄褐等色，剖开则原色尚存，入厂后经工人依色泽分别入钢机轮绞数十分钟，每分钟百数十轮转，并经长流水不停漂洗（无水难绞）。在搬运中设有染些沙秽，已被辗粉碎漂洗净尽。至须翻绞许久，为使各片熔化色泽纯一，制成后每条阔一尺余，厚三四分，长二十左右尺，重十余二十斤，吊在热汽房，经三十左右日夜乃能干，是为厚绉胶。此等原料湿片马来亚初时亦有，后均改制烟片。
    四、另有一种叫薄绉胶，是各胶园所必有的产物，其原料为胶丝与胶丸。胶丝系从胶橡割口揭起所凝结的胶乳。胶丸系胶乳集中经铜丝网过滤，漏不下等胶用手掬成丸。出售时已无水气，此两种约占胶产量十分之一强。由贩商收集售给胶厂，制成薄绉，其制法与厚胶绉同样。但每条重仅四五斤，分三四种色泽不一。有特制斑纹名毛刀绉。前我经营厚薄绉胶售寄欧美三十余年，有时赔还不对号数多少款，绝未有赔还所谓沙粒与杂质一文钱。至赔还例系该处专门公司的证据。
    五、本人前在新加坡营胶品厂，制轮胎靴鞋、衣帽医具及其他用品许多种，或告我应仿外国专制三两种较易精工，此点我非不知，但用意在于推广生产各种品经验，不专以营利为目的。念及日本小国，尚有胶制品厂四百余所，而我国则寂寂无闻，故我厂产品采取多样化，要起示范作用。化学实验室设备周全，成品制法不守秘密，公开于职员。那时厚薄绉胶虽较廉于烟片，不似近年之多，在我经营十余年间工人常数千，所用橡胶厚薄绉占九成余，烟片采用甚少，除车内胎及细软品有用烟片，其他从未有用也。
    六、1950年，黄炎培兼部长召集全国四百余胶厂会议，邀我报告南洋橡胶情况。我提起不采用厚薄绉胶之损失，其时每月用胶四千余吨，不久禁运发生，我此议不复重提，去年夏新加坡马来亚取消禁运。我即致函周总理及全国人代会常委会，详尽申说不用厚薄绉胶之损失。且引新加坡胶价元月至四月，绉胶比烟片每吨平均可廉宜三百元。并告人造胶日增，烟片胶价必更贵，现用胶数量较前增加不少，如仍不采用绉胶，于外汇必更多损失。至下半年烟片比绉胶每吨竟加价至四百余元。
    七、去年10月我为成立全国侨联事来京，适新马工商贸易考察团在京相会，云成交橡胶烟片七千吨，绉胶谓不合用无肯购云云。我甚不解自三个月前向政府及人代会两机关建议，何乃毫无效果，适上海公私合营中南胶厂股东兼经理庄怡生来京参加侨联会议，告以政府不用绉胶之损失。我拟致函新加坡寄厚薄绉胶多少劳贵厂化验，庄君甚表赞同，但他须先征上海第二轻工业局周局长同意，即同车至上海会见周局长赞成，我即驰函新加坡两家胶业公司，各配运厚薄绉胶多少，交上海中南橡胶厂化验。
    八、12月中旬我接全国人代会来函，内夹化学工业部对我建议的反映如下：（1）绉片强力低；（2）磨耗大；（3）含杂质较多，特别是沙粒较多；（4）定申强力低；（5）色暗乏美观，成品恐难出售，须请商部考虑；（6）不适合用于轮胎生产。据此则绉胶之不合采用似无疑义。但所不解者，如果绉胶不合用，我前十余年制胶品经验免说，但就欧美而言，何以彼邦自有绉胶至今四五十年，由每年销量数万吨增至数十万吨。非用于制轮胎和其他成品将作何用，更以实例证之，如新加坡牙笼桥头一厂，系美国有名轮胎公司“排那实敦”所设。专制厚薄绉胶运往彼国自用，非如商家贩售者。
    九、胶制品所用之原料，除布线及车内胎多用胶外，其他40％左右为橡胶，60％左右为白土及各药料约各半数。设使绉胶果含有千百分之一的沙粉或杂质粉，于各成品何碍，至云色暗难售更觉无谓，如车内胎多红色，其他胶品各色都有，漆至黑何能使之红白及各色，盖在配合何色颜料为主，非全靠其本色，若最次之绉胶要与烟片同样须加四五斤，然可以增加成品之体积来补，事实非尽牺牲也。
    十、世界目今用胶有三种，天然胶二种，每年约二百万吨，人造胶一种约一百多万吨，天然胶之二种烟片占一百三四十万吨，绉胶六七十万吨，胶质优劣以烟片为最佳，绉胶次之，人造胶为下，绉胶可以单用，如较次者每百斤加用四五斤，其功能即与烟片同。人造胶不可单用，必须与烟片胶混合乃可制造物品。十余年来人造胶出产激增，故烟片胶销路愈广，价值愈升，我国既无人造胶，又不用绉胶，专采昂贵的烟片胶为各制品原料，持与世界有人造胶竞争烟片胶，难免愈来损失愈大矣。
    十一、新加坡益和南益两胶业公司，得我函告即于去年12月各配运厚薄绉胶四种于上海中南胶厂。即由周局长同庄君分交上海大中华、正泰、联一及其他并中南共八厂化验研究。经分段细详实验多次，每次验后集会讨论，在化学性质与物理功能，前后历六十日，所得结果除两次报告均佳唯第三次未到耳。
    十二、我以为负责橡胶制造化学家，不但只知胶质性能得优劣，还要知各种胶价的贵贱，与制品有关切用料，就中价格变化尤以胶价为最。乃核算分配得质量不差，成本减轻的功效，现我国各胶厂非属国营即属公私合营，出品售价由国营商业机关核定，无私商的竞争，成本虽高专利仍操在我。因此一般工业追求质量，或不惜工本损失转嫁于民众，然民众损失终归于政府。如球布胶鞋每双售六七元，设有人竞售可减半数，这仅就国内范围来说，若就国际市场而论不能与人竞争，则以不知物价，甚至不知世界公用较廉之原料。
    十三、南洋厚薄绉胶厂，新加坡约占40％，马来亚、印尼、泰国约占60％，解放后未闻新加坡有运厚薄绉胶到我国，至于马印泰胶厂，新加坡益和南益两公司占十之八九，亦未闻有运厚薄绉胶来我国，此次化学工业部反映我证明绉胶不合用，究竟是厚或是薄，何处何年何月运来，是已经制品失败，抑或经许多厂或仅少数人在厂外化验而已。
    化学工业部认厚薄绉胶不合用，为含有沙杂质，此所谓因噎而废食，盖制胶品的原料，除橡胶约占四成外，其他六成大部分白土与杂物，而上海等厂认为化验可合用，彼此见解不同，然合用与不合用，关系得失外汇甚巨，每月多至数百万元，既不信任南洋每年出产厚薄绉胶销售欧美数十万吨，几都为华侨所经营，又何不先去购来厚薄绉胶多少，交各厂制成用品，作实用实验，而但凭化学家之判断，未免过于轻率，兹如政府同意为实制实物实验，我愿自备外汇三万元，向新加坡购厚薄绉胶十六吨，交上海各名厂制造最通销用品，以十吨制大小汽车轮胎千个，以三吨制人力车胎四五千个，以三吨制鞋一万余双，成品后（除汽车胎待一个月）实用二个月，成功与失败即可立见也。
    十四、周总理去年在全国政协第二次会议时，特别召集常务委员会，宣告全国政协系协商性质，今为广征意见，要与国务院及全国代表会提案，同一重视。合参研究慎重考虑，对所提议实行与否，抑如何处理必须逐一切实答复。倘有未满意者，尽可来函解释，决不辜负建议者雅意云云。
    周总理如此伟大虚怀，重视群众意见，集思广益，从善如流的深意，使我铭感难忘。故敢冒昧陈述如上。至于全国人代常务会对诸负责部门的反应，我还希望他们考查批判，给予正确的指示。（附图片）
