    Laundry Detergent Successfully Trial-Produced
    Two Jiao Worth of Laundry Detergent Can Equal Two Bars of Laundry Soap

    (Our newspaper reports) The state-owned Shanghai Soap Factory recently trial-produced a new product – "Renren Laundry Detergent".

    This laundry detergent is convenient to use, containing a powerful cleaning booster that replaces some oils, resulting in lower costs and excellent value. Buying two jiao worth of laundry detergent is equivalent to two bars of laundry soap. In advanced countries, the consumption of detergents far exceeds that of solid laundry soap. The amount of oil required to produce one batch of soap can produce twice the weight of laundry detergent. Therefore, using some oil and a cleaning booster to make laundry detergent is of great significance for saving oil. The composition of laundry detergent is easier to adjust than solid soap, and production can be continuous, making it possible to achieve fully mechanized production.

    洗衣粉试制成功
    二角钱的洗衣粉能抵两块洗衣肥皂
    本报讯　国营上海制皂厂最近试制了一种新产品——“人人洗衣粉”。
    这种洗衣粉使用方便，其中含有去污力极强的助洗剂，代替了部分油脂，因而成本较低，使用非常合算，如果买二角钱的洗衣粉，就可以抵得上两块洗衣皂。现在各先进国家洗涤剂的用量已远超过块状洗衣皂。生产一连肥皂所需油脂可生产两倍重量的洗衣粉，因而用部分油脂和助洗剂制成洗衣粉，对于节约油脂具有很大的意义。洗衣粉的成分比固体肥皂容易调节，生产可以连续化，这样就有了实现完全机械化生产的可能。
