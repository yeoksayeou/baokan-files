    Xinhua News Agency, March 19th: TASS Beirut, March 18th: Some Lebanese newspapers and political figures oppose the Lebanese government's joint communiqué with the United States regarding the acceptance of the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

    "Al Siyasa" wrote: "From this communiqué, it can be seen that the Lebanese government has tied the country to the American chariot in order to obtain military and financial assistance."

    "Al Anwar" published an article entitled "The Nation in Danger." The article stated that the Lebanese government has openly sided with Western countries. It said that this position means the Lebanese government is determined to allow the country to be subject to American domination.

    Newspapers published statements from a number of prominent Lebanese political figures—former President of the Republic Bishara al-Khoury, former Prime Minister Saeb Salam, former Foreign Minister Hamid Frangieh, and others—condemning the Lebanese-American communiqué.

    The Lebanese National Congress Party held a meeting of representatives on the 17th. According to newspaper reports, the National Congress Party called for opposition to the Lebanese-American joint communiqué.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 19th: TASS Damascus, March 19th: Amman reports that the Jordanian Communist Party issued a statement on the termination of the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty, calling on the Jordanian people to be vigilant against imperialist conspiracies and to strengthen their struggle against the imperialist "Eisenhower Doctrine."

    The Jordanian Communist Party demanded that the Jordanian government reject the "Eisenhower Doctrine," stop imperialist agents from carrying out subversive activities in the country, strive for the complete abolition of military bases and the withdrawal of British troops from Jordan, and strive to establish diplomatic and economic relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries in the socialist camp.
