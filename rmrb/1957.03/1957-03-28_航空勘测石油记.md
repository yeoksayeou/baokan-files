　　Aerial Surveying for Oil
　　By Our Correspondent Lu Chaoqi
    During the clear days in mid-January, an airplane was frequently seen flying over the plains of several hundred thousand square kilometers centered around Shanghai and Nanjing. Sometimes this airplane would fly all day at an altitude of three thousand meters; at other times, it would fly all day at a low altitude of three hundred meters. It was not patrolling to protect the security of the motherland's airspace and territorial waters, nor was it transporting passengers or goods from one place to another. Its sole mission was to search for the blood of industry – oil.
    On January 17th, I boarded this airplane for the first time. It was converted from an ordinary passenger plane, but it lacked the sofas, elaborate carpets, and curtains of a typical passenger plane, and there were no heating facilities. There were only a few cold iron chairs. In the front right corner was installed an automatic electronic airborne magnetometer, and on the left was a large wooden box containing tools. A cotton quilt was spread on the wooden box for the instrument operators to rest in shifts. In the empty cabin, besides myself, were two comrades from Geology Ministry's 104th Aerial Survey Team. One was named Zhu Yan, who graduated from the Physics Department of Peking University four years ago and is now the technical head of the 104th Team. The other was Cen Yuezhong, who graduated from the Northeast Geological College of Changchun three years ago and is now the operational technician for this instrument. They both began learning automatic electronic airborne magnetic surveying from Soviet experts after the 104th Aerial Survey Team was established last August. Initially, the experts operated the instruments themselves, and they watched from the side. Later, they operated the instruments, and the experts guided them from the side. Today was their first time working independently. However, they were very calm. This was because they had already mastered the instrument, and this morning, experts Vilkovski and Shaposhnikov had checked the instrument again. When the plane took off, the two experts also told them that if they encountered any difficulties, they should contact the airport control room, where they would be waiting.
    Today, they were flying "control lines" to survey the Earth's magnetic variation patterns in this area. The plane first flew north from Shanghai to Dongtai County on the East China Sea coast north of the Yangtze River, then west from Dongtai to Gaoyou Lake, then south from Gaoyou Lake to Hangzhou, and then back to Shanghai via Songjiang. The entire journey was more than 1,600 kilometers, which is more than 300 kilometers more than Beijing to Shanghai. A few minutes after the plane left the ground, it rose to an altitude of three thousand meters. The green light on the measuring instrument flashed, and the electric bell rang, which was a signal from the navigator in the front cabin, indicating that the plane had entered the official survey route and work had begun. Cen Yuezhong put on a coat, held a pencil in one hand and a flight logbook in the other, crossed them over his abdomen, leaned his head back on the chair, and closed his eyes slightly to contemplate, like a traveler sitting down to rest. Only when the instrument's bell told him that the plane had reached a new landmark every five or six minutes did he change his posture and record the time of arrival at the landmark, wind direction, temperature, and so on. Zhu Yan, on the other hand, was bent over a small table made of sheet iron, concentrating on taking notes.
    I sat in a chair by the window, looking down at the earth. The plane smoothly passed over one village after another, one stream after another, and one lake after another. There were still traces of snow on the roofs of the farmhouses. The newly plowed black soil, the green wheat seedlings, the withered yellow grassland, and the turbid yellow lakes were intricately mixed together, as beautiful as the five-color grass in a spring park. The plane flew over Taihu Lake, and the multi-story buildings of the sanatorium by the lake, the trees on the lakeside, and the small boats parked under the trees were charming even in winter. The magnificent Yangtze River lay horizontally in front of us, and those wooden boats with black sails drifted downwind. I did not understand how the instrument in the plane could penetrate this beautiful picture and peek at the underground treasures. I saw Cen Yuezhong still sitting comfortably in front of the instrument, so I sat next to him and asked him for guidance.
    He explained everything from the formation of petroleum geological structures to the principle of the instrument, from how to master the instrument to how to study the data. He drew various charts on paper and also used gestures to make analogies. However, I still couldn't understand it. I only understood that there was a recorder on this instrument, about the size of a medium-sized radio, and the red pencil kept drawing winding lines on the small grid paper. These lines reflected the Earth's magnetic variation patterns on the flight path. The ground geological staff use this data to determine whether there are petroleum geological structures. Cen Yuezhong also told me that airborne magnetic surveying is the most economical: it saves manpower, saves time, saves money, and is accurate. This plane flies 280 kilometers per hour. If it flies a line every ten kilometers, it can survey an area of 280,000 square kilometers in just one hundred hours. If manpower were used, how many people and how much equipment would be needed? How much would these people have to walk and how much suffering would they have to endure to complete so much work in one hundred hours! Listening and thinking, I deeply appreciated the great Soviet elder brother, because they invented this instrument, they sent us this instrument, and they also sent experts to teach us the technology.
    There are also difficulties in aerial surveying for oil. Last winter, this plane was working in the Northeast region. Zhu Yan told me that working in the Jiangnan area is more difficult than in the Northeast region. The Jiangnan plain stretches for thousands of miles, and the climate is warm, so why is the work more difficult than in the Northeast? He said that it was mainly in terms of flight. So, I went into the front cabin of the plane to see how the flight crew worked.
    There were six people here: two captains, two navigators, a radio operator, and a flight mechanic. Captain Ma Yu was at the helm. His upright sitting posture, his eyes fixed on the front, and his tightly closed lips showed that his attention was very focused. Captain Liang Yingwu, who was sitting next to him, was holding a 1:500,000 map and assisting the navigator in his work. Navigator Yang Hongliang stood behind Ma Yu, holding a 1:250,000 map in his left hand and pressing his index finger on the route on the map. Every time the plane passed over a village, his index finger moved to that village on the map. Every one or two minutes, he would pass the map to the middle of the two captains and tell them the location of the landmark. Trainee navigator Jin Rongnan stood next to him, carefully observing how he worked and listening to his explanations.
    I once heard people say that general civil aviation navigators only need a simple map drawn by themselves. Why are the eyes and fingers of the navigators here always on the map? Is it because the navigators have no experience? But people told me: Comrade Yang Hongliang has more than ten years of navigation experience and has navigated on ocean routes for a long time – which only very good navigators can do. Is it because the two captains have no experience? That's not true either. They both have more than ten years of flying experience and have flown several types of aircraft. Ma Yu has even flown bombers. Moreover, in addition to being familiar with piloting, they also understand navigation, communication, and other operations. Last July and August, when Liang Yingwu was aerial surveying iron ore in Inner Mongolia, he and his assistant worked as navigators, communicators, and flight mechanics. Mastering the changes in wind direction and wind speed (what insiders call "drift") is very important for the accuracy of the flight. This plane does not have an instrument to measure "drift," but they can quickly observe the angle of "drift" with the naked eye, just like a skilled steelworker can observe the "heat" of molten steel with the naked eye. Even Team Leader Wang of the 104th Team praised their skills when he was talking to me!
    After the plane flew from Hangzhou to Shanghai, Comrade Jin Rongnan navigated. Yang Hongliang sat down and smoked while checking today's flight log. After he finished checking, I asked him: "What is the difference between general route flying and aerial survey flying?"
    "The main difference is in the requirements for flight quality," he explained. On general routes, it doesn't matter if the plane deviates from the route (what insiders call "off course") by four or five kilometers, is one or twenty kilometers per hour faster or slower, or is tens of meters higher or lower, as long as safety and on-time arrival are guaranteed. Therefore, it is possible to fly in clouds, snow, fog, wind, and rain. Aerial survey flying is different. For example, if the route stipulates that the plane must pass over the Shanghai International Hotel, the plane cannot fly past it more than one kilometer to the left or right; the speed per hour must not be more than ten kilometers faster or slower than the specified speed, and the altitude of the plane must not be more than ten meters different from the specified altitude.
      "What if it deviates by one kilometer?"
    Yang Hongliang explained that if there is an occasional deviation in a day's flight, and it is discovered and corrected immediately, the impact is not too great. If there are many deviations and they cannot be corrected immediately, then the flight must be repeated once. He said: "However, every time we repeat a flight, even if we just turn two more circles, the flight cost will be over budget. We not only guarantee quality and safety, but also save fuel bit by bit!"
    I thought: a one-kilometer boundary, if walking, will take more than ten minutes, but for a plane that flies 280 kilometers per hour, it is so short, only a dozen seconds to fly past. So, I said to Comrade Yang Hongliang: "In that case, you are so nervous just to avoid deviating by one kilometer, right?"
      "You can say that," Yang Hongliang replied. "In order to avoid deviating by one kilometer, we have very strict requirements for the weather. We cannot fly in low clouds, fog, snow, or rain, because they block our view and prevent us from seeing the ground more than five kilometers away. We also cannot fly in strong winds (speeds exceeding forty kilometers per hour), because they affect the stability of the flight and easily blow the plane off course. In order to avoid deviating by one kilometer, even when flying in 'clear sky' weather, our two navigators and one captain constantly turn their eyes from the map to the ground and then from the ground to the map to find the landmarks ahead and tell the driving captain."
      "Why is it more difficult to work in the Jiangnan area than in the Northeast?" In the evening, when we were chatting around the stove, I asked the captains and navigators this question.
    They explained that the so-called difficulty mainly refers to navigation work. In the Northeast, they use 1:100,000 maps. The shapes of towns, villages, mountains, rivers, roads, and lakes are all drawn on the map and are also painted with different colors to make them clear at a glance. But on the maps they are using now, all the villages and towns are just circles, and the shapes of some medium and small cities are not accurate. The villages in Jiangnan are dense and small, and the lakes, rivers, and roads are intertwined like a net. Some rivers, lakes, and roads are not marked on the map, and those that are marked are not distinguished with different colors, and some roads and rivers are very difficult to distinguish. In some places, the map shows only one village with a stream passing through it, but the village on the ground has several streams of various sizes. In some places, the map shows only a lonely village, but there is a lake next to the village on the ground. In order to determine whether the landmark on the ground is the landmark marked on the map, the navigators have to find all the nearby villages, rivers, and lakes and judge them from their interrelationships. However, the plane is flying non-stop, and if the navigator's eyes turn slower or hesitate slightly, the plane will fly past. In this way, in order to ensure that they do not deviate by one kilometer, the navigators and captains are very nervous.
      "Although aerial survey flying is more stressful and harder than general route flying, we get used to it," Comrade Ma Yu said while stoking the stove: "We are building socialism, so where is there no difficulty? Many comrades working in the Civil Aviation Administration want to come to the aerial survey team to participate directly in construction. We are sent to survey oil – a resource urgently needed for our country's construction, and many people envy us, saying that we are lucky. When we know that the use of modern instruments can replace thousands and tens of thousands of ground survey personnel, saving time and money for the country, we are happy no matter how hard it is. For example, ground mechanics Ouyang He and Wu Jundao, in Changchun last December, their hands were frozen, but they still rushed to the airport at four o'clock every morning to check the parts and heat the plane, never complaining!

　　航空勘测石油记
　　本报记者　陆超祺
    在1月中、下旬的晴朗的日子里，在以上海、南京为中心的几十万平方公里的平原上空，经常有一架飞机在飞翔。这架飞机，有时候整天在三千公尺的高空上飞；有时候，又整天在三百公尺的低空飞。它不是为着保护祖国领空领海的安全而巡逻，也不是为着把旅客或物资从这里运到那里去。它唯一的任务是寻找工业的血液——石油。
    1月17日，我第一次坐上这架飞机。它是由普通客机改装成的，但是，没有一般客机的沙发，没有讲究的地毯和窗帘，也没有保暖设备。这里只有几只冷冰冰的铁椅，前右边安装着一台自动电子航空磁测仪器，左边放着一个装工具的大木箱。木箱上铺着一条棉被，是给仪器操作员轮流休息用的。在空洞洞的座舱里，除了我，还有地质部一○四航测队的两位同志。一位叫朱楧，四年前才从北京大学物理系毕业，现在是一○四队的技术负责人。另一位叫岑岳忠，三年前才从长春东北地质学院毕业，现在是这台仪器的操作技术员。他们都是去年8月一○四航测队成立以后，才开始跟苏联专家学习自动电子航空磁测的。起初是专家亲自操作，他们在旁边看，后来是他们操作，专家在旁边指导。今天是他们第一次独立工作。但是，他们非常沉着。这是因为他们已经掌握了仪器，而且今天早上，维尔柯夫斯基和沙波施尼柯夫两位专家又检查过仪器。飞机起飞的时候，两位专家还告诉他们，要是遇到困难，就跟飞机场调度室连系，他俩在那里等候。
    今天是飞“控制线”，勘测这个地区的地球磁性变化规律。飞机先从上海往北飞到长江以北东海边的东台县，从东台往西飞到高邮湖，再从高邮湖往南飞到杭州，然后经松江回上海。全程一千六百多公里，比北京到上海还要多三百多公里。飞机离地面以后几分钟功夫，就上升到三千公尺高空。测量仪器上的绿色电灯闪了一闪，电铃叮叮地响，这是领航员从前舱发来的讯号，示意飞机已经进入正式测量路线，工作开始了。岑岳忠披上大衣，一只手拿着铅笔，一只手拿着飞行日志表，交叉放在腹上，头仰靠在椅背上，两眼微闭着沉思，像一个旅行者坐下来休息一样。只有每隔五分六分钟，仪器的铃声告诉他飞机又到达一个新航标的时候，他才改变姿势，把到达航标的时间、风向、温度等等记录下来。朱楧则伏在一张用铁皮搭成的小桌上，专心致意地抄笔记。
    我坐在靠窗的一只椅子上俯视大地。飞机平稳地越过一个村庄又一个村庄，越过一条溪流又一条溪流，越过一个湖泊又一个湖泊。农家屋顶上还有积雪的痕迹。刚刚翻过的黑色土地，青色的麦苗，枯黄色的草地，混黄色的湖泊错综在一起，好像春天公园里五色草一样美丽。飞机从太湖边飞过，那湖边的疗养院的多层建筑物，那湖滨的树木和停泊在树下的小船，即使在冬天，也显得很迷人。壮阔的长江横卧在眼前，那些张着黑帆的木船顺风漂流。我不明白飞机里的这台仪器怎样透过这幅美丽的图画，窥探地下的宝藏。我看见岑岳忠仍然舒服地坐在仪器前面，就去同他并排地坐着，向他领教。
    他从石油地质构造的形成讲到仪器的原理，从怎样掌握仪器讲到怎样研究资料。他在纸上画着各种各样的图表，还用手势打比喻。但是，我还是领悟不了。我只了解一点，就是这个仪器上有个记录器，像中型收音机一般大，红铅笔不停地在小方格纸上画出弯弯曲曲的线条来。这些线条反映着航线的地球磁性变化。地面的地质工作人员就是根据这些资料来判断有没有石油地质构造的。岑岳忠还告诉我说，航空磁测是最经济的：省人力、省时间、省钱，又准确。这架飞机每小时飞二百八十公里，如果每隔十公里飞一条线，那末，只消一百小时，就可以测完二十八万平方公里面积。要是用人力，那需要多少人、多少设备？这些人又要走多少路，吃多少苦，才能在一百小时内完成这么多工作量啊！我听着想着，深深地感激伟大的苏联老大哥。因为他们发明了这种仪器，他们给我们送来这台仪器，还派专家来给我们传授技术。
    航空勘测石油也有困难。去年冬天，这架飞机在东北地区工作。朱楧告诉我说，在江南地区工作比在东北地区还要困难。江南平原千里，气候暖和，为什么工作反比东北的困难呢？他说主要是飞行方面的。于是，我走进飞机前舱，想看飞行人员怎样工作。
    这里有六个人：两位机长、两位领航员、一位报务员和一位随机机械员。机长马豫在掌舵。他那端端正正的坐姿，那注视前方的眼睛，那紧闭的嘴唇，说明他的注意力非常集中。和他并排坐着的另一位机长梁应吾拿着一张五十万分之一的地图，协助领航员工作。领航员杨宏量站在马豫背后，左手拿着一份二十五万分之一的地图，右手食指按着地图上的航线，飞机每越过一个村庄，食指就挪到地图上的这个村庄。每隔一、二分钟，他就把地图揍到两位机长的中间去，告诉他们航标的方位。见习领航员金荣南站在他旁边，细心地观察他怎样工作，倾听他的解释。
    我曾经听人家说，一般民用航空的领航员，只用一张自己画的简单地图就行了，为什么这里的领航员的眼睛、手指不离地图呢？是领航员没有经验吗？可是人家对我说：杨宏量同志已有十几年的领航经验，长期在海洋航线上领过航——这是很好的领航员才能胜任的。是两位机长没有经验吗？也不是。他们两人都有十几年的飞行经验，驾驶过好几种飞机，马豫还驾驶过轰炸机哩。而且他们除了熟悉驾驶业务以外，还懂得领航、通讯等业务。去年七、八月间，梁应吾在内蒙古地区航测铁矿的时候，就是和助手两人兼做领航、通讯和随机机械工作的。掌握风向风速的变化（内行话叫“偏流”）对飞行的准确性有很大关系。这架飞机没有测量“偏流”的仪器，他们两人可以很快地用肉眼观察出“偏流”的角度来，好像熟练的炼钢工人可以用肉眼观察钢水的“火候”一样。他们三个人的技术，连一○四队王队长在和我谈话的时候，还称赞一番哩！
    飞机从杭州向上海飞以后，金荣南同志领航。杨宏量坐下来一边吸烟，一边核对今天的飞行日志。等他核对完以后，我就问他：“一般航线飞行跟航测飞行有什么不同？”
    “主要是对飞行质量的要求不一样。”他解释说。在一般航线上，飞机偏出航线（内行话叫“偏航”）四公里五公里，每小时快慢一、二十公里，高低相差几十公尺，是无所谓的，只要保证安全和准时到达就行。所以，有云、下雪、下雾、刮风、下雨，都可以飞。航测飞行可不同。比如说，航线规定从上海国际饭店经过，飞机就不能从它的左边或右边一公里以外的地方飞过去；每小时的速度不得比规定的快或慢十公里，飞机的高度不得比规定的相差十公尺。
      “要是偏航一公里怎么办呢？”
    杨宏量解释说，在一天的飞行中，要是偶然的偏航，而且马上发现，马上纠正，影响还不算大。要是偏航的次数较多，又不能马上纠正，那就要重飞一次了。他说：“不过，每重复飞行一次，那怕只多转两个圈，飞行成本就会超支的。我们不只保证质量和安全，还要一点一滴地节约油料呢！”
    我想：一公里界限，步行的话，快的也要十几分钟，可是，对一架每小时飞二百八十公里的飞机来说，是多么短促，只十几秒钟功夫就飞过去了。所以，我对杨宏量同志说：“这样说来，你们那样紧张，就是为着不偏航一公里吧？”
      “可以这样说。”杨宏量答道。“为了不偏航一公里，我们对天气要求非常严格。有低云层，有雾，有雪，有雨，都不能飞，因为它们阻挡视线，使我们看不清五公里以外的地面。刮大风（每小时速度超过四十公里）也不能飞，因为它影响飞行的稳定性，又容易把飞机吹偏。为了不偏航一公里，即使在“碧空”天气飞行，我们两位领航员和一位机长，眼睛就时刻地从地图转到地面，又从地面转到地图，把前方航标找出来，告诉驾驶的机长。”
      “为什么在江南地区工作比在东北困难呢？”晚上，我们围炉聊天的时候，我向机长和领航员们提出这个问题。
    他们解释说，所谓困难，主要是指领航工作。在东北，他们用十万分之一的地图。大小城镇、村庄、山、川、道路、湖泊的形状，都在地图上画出来，并且还涂上不同的颜色，使人一目了然。而现在他们使用的地图上，所有的村镇只有一个圈，有的中、小城市的形状也不准确。江南的村庄密而小，湖泊、河流、道路综错如网。有些河流、湖泊、道路，地图上没有划出来，划出来的也没有用不同的颜色加以区别，有些道路和河流非常难于辨别。有些地方，地图上的村庄只有一条溪流经过，但地面上的村庄却有大大小小的几条溪流。有些地方，地图上只有一个孤伶伶的村庄，但地面上的村庄旁边却有一个湖泊。为了确定地面上的航标是不是地图上所划的航标，领航员们不得不把附近的村庄、河流、湖泊等都找出来，从它们的相互关系中加以判断。然而飞机是不停地飞着的，领航员的眼睛转得慢一些，稍为犹豫一些，飞机就飞过去了。这样，为了保证不偏航一公里，领航员和机长就非常紧张。
      “航测飞行虽然比一般航线飞行紧张、辛苦，但习惯了也没什么。”马豫同志一边通火炉，一边说：“建设社会主义嘛，那里没有困难呢？在民航局工作的同志，很多人都想到航测队来，直接参加建设。我们被派来勘测石油——我国建设迫切需要的资源，多少人羡慕我们，说我们走了运。当我们知道，运用现代仪器可以代替几千几万地面勘测人员，为国家争取时间，节约钱的时候，再苦还是高兴的。譬如，地面机械员欧阳和武俊道吧，去年12月在长春的时候，手都冻肿了，但每天早晨四点多钟照样赶到飞机场检查机件，给飞机加热，从不叫一声苦！
