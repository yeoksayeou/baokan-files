Shaanxi: Mountain Farmers Show Great Enthusiasm for Spring Production

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an: Mountainous area farmers in Shaanxi Province are vigorously developing diversified economies this spring, adapting to local conditions.

In the hilly and mountainous northern Loess Plateau region, which is suitable for forestry and animal husbandry, farmers are not only actively breeding large livestock and sheep this spring, but also vigorously planting and cultivating fruit trees and mulberry trees. In areas producing apples, such as Huangling, Luochuan, and Yanchang counties, farmers are preparing to graft superior varieties such as Red Delicious and Guoguang under the guidance of newly established horticultural guidance stations. Farmers in the Yan'an Special District, who have a tradition of planting mulberry trees and raising silkworms, plan to cultivate more than 300 mu of mulberry seedlings and plant more than 900,000 mulberry trees this spring. Currently, farmers in this special district have purchased nearly 3,000 silkworm egg sheets from Sichuan Province. Each sheet can produce 40 jin of cocoons, which is one or two times higher than the yield of local varieties.

The vast area along the Great Wall is a relatively good grape-growing area. This year, the region plans to open up more than 8,500 mu of new vineyards, and farmers are now cultivating seedlings and renovating the land.

The Qinling and Bashan mountainous areas in the south are characterized by large mountains, dense forests, and a humid climate, making them suitable for the development of mountain products and specialties. This year, the region plans to develop more than 800,000 mu of tree species with high economic value, such as Eucommia ulmoides, Quercus dentata, Chinese prickly ash, and cork oak. Since the beginning of spring, more than 50,000 mu have been planted, along with hundreds of thousands of scattered trees. In addition to planning a net increase of more than 300,000 pigs, the Hanzhong, Ankang, and Shangluo special districts, located in the middle of these two major mountain ranges, will also utilize the abundant aquatic grass areas to raise sheep. The more than 16,000 sheep transported from the northern Yan'an area last year are generally growing well, and some ewes have already given birth to twins. This year, these three special districts also plan to transport more than 20,000 sheep from northern Shaanxi to help farmers develop animal husbandry production. In addition, farmers in the mountainous areas of the province are also actively carrying out artificial cultivation of wild medicinal materials such as Ganoderma lucidum, Tussilago farfara, Astragalus membranaceus, Moutan bark, and Polygala tenuifolia.

Relevant departments in Shaanxi Province are also assisting farmers in mountainous areas to carry out diversified operations by purchasing their products and solving transportation problems. Since the beginning of this year, the Shaanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has increased its purchases of Codonopsis pilosula, Astragalus membranaceus, and musk in the Hanzhong and Ankang special districts by one-third compared to the same period last year. In addition, it has also delivered nearly 800,000 yuan in wool and cashmere advance purchase funds to farmers in the Yan'an and Yulin special districts. In terms of transportation, in addition to strengthening the maintenance of the existing mountain road network, the province also plans to build three simple roads this year to facilitate the timely transportation of mountain goods and local specialties produced by farmers.

Mountainous areas account for 54% of the cultivated land area in Shaanxi Province. In order to do a good job in leading the development of diversified economies in mountainous areas, with grain production as the main focus, various localities have initially formulated mountain construction plans this year. The province also established a Mountain Construction Committee last winter.

Shandong: Calling on Cadres to Settle in Mountainous Areas

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 24th: The Shandong Provincial Mountainous Area Work Conference decided to do everything possible to help people in mountainous areas accelerate production development.

The conference, held from the 18th to the 23rd, determined that the future policy for developing mountainous area production in Shandong Province is: strengthen leadership, conduct comprehensive planning, comprehensively carry out soil and water conservation work, implement the policy of combining agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, comprehensively develop mountainous area production, and increase the income of mountainous area people from various aspects. The specific requirements are to achieve initial results in soil and water conservation within three to five years, basically prevent the continued deepening of soil erosion, and enable people in mountainous areas to live a life where they have enough to eat, enough to burn, enough to wear, and enough to use.

The conference focused on studying how to strengthen leadership in mountainous area work in the future. It believes that in areas where all or most of the area is mountainous, the development of mountainous area production should be taken as a regular central task. In areas with some mountainous areas, there should also be certain Party and government leaders who are specifically responsible for mountainous area construction work. The heads of leading organs at all levels should frequently go deep into mountainous areas, conduct investigations and research, listen to the opinions and demands of the people in mountainous areas, and at the same time call on cadres to settle in mountainous areas and help build mountainous areas. At present, all localities should first formulate plans for comprehensively developing mountainous area production through investigation and research and mobilizing the masses. In formulating plans, we must not only have a long-term development perspective, but also start from the current urgent needs of the people in mountainous areas; we must not only have three-to-five-year plans, but also small-segment plans for phased implementation. The conference pointed out that on the one hand, various localities already have some good examples of building mountainous areas, and they should seriously summarize their experiences and promote them; on the other hand, various localities should also establish work bases in mountainous areas and continue to create experience in building mountainous areas. Finally, the conference also required all economic departments and cultural, health, and other departments throughout the province to support the development of production by the people in mountainous areas with the greatest enthusiasm.

Mountainous areas in Shandong Province account for more than one-third of the total area of the province, with a population of more than 13 million. Most of these mountainous areas are old revolutionary base areas. In recent years, production in various mountainous areas has developed considerably. The unit area yield of grain is generally about 40% higher than before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and certain achievements have also been made in the development of forestry, water conservancy, animal husbandry, and silkworm cocoons. In some mountainous areas with faster production development, people's living standards have improved significantly. However, the production development in mountainous areas is still very uneven and relatively slow. Many people in mountainous areas still have certain difficulties in production and life. In individual places that were severely ravaged during the war, the living standards of the people are still relatively low.

　　千方百计发展山区生产
　　陕西：山区农民春季生产劲头大
    新华社西安电　陕西省山区农民在今年春季生产中，因地制宜地大力发展多种经济。
    北部黄土高原地区丘陵重叠，宜林宜牧。这个地区的农民今春除积极繁殖大家畜和羊外，还大力种植和培育果树和蚕桑。黄陵、洛川、延长等县出产苹果的地区，今年农民们在新设立的园艺指导站指导下，准备嫁接元帅、国光等优良品种。一向有植桑养蚕习惯的延安专区的农民，今春计划培育桑苗三百多亩，增植桑树九十多万株。目前，这个专区的农民已从四川省购进蚕种近三千张，这个蚕种每张能产四十斤蚕茧，比当地土种产量高一、两倍。
    辽阔的长城沿线地区是一个比较好的葡萄种植区，今年这个地区计划新辟葡萄园八千五百多亩，现在农民们正在培育苗枝、整修园地。
    南部秦岭、巴山山区，山大林深，气候湿润，适宜于山货、特产的发展，这个地区今年计划发展具有较高经济价值的杜仲、槲树、花椒、栓皮栎等树种八十多万亩，入春以来已经种了五万多亩，零星植树数十万株；位于这两大山脉中间的汉中、安康和商雒三个专区，今年除计划净增生猪三十多万口以外，还将利用丰富的水草地区养羊。去年从北部延安地区运去的一万六千多只羊，一般生长良好，有些母羊已经下了双羔，今年这三个专区还准备陆续从陕北运去羊两万多只，帮助农民发展畜牧业生产。此外，这个省的山区农民还积极进行甘蕤、冬花、黄耆、丹皮和远志等野生药材的人工栽培工作。
    陕西省的有关部门也从收购和解决山区交通等方面，协助山区农民开展多种经营。陕西省供销合作社今年以来，在汉中、安康两个专区收购的党参、黄耆、麝香的总值较去年同期增加了三分之一；另外，还把近八十万元的羊毛、羊绒预购金交付给延安、榆林两个专区的农民。在交通运输方面，这个省除加强现有山区公路网的养护外，今年还计划兴修三条简易公路，以便及时运出农民生产的山货和土特产品。
    陕西省有54％的耕地面积在山区。为了做好以粮食生产为主发展多种经济的山区生产的领导工作，今年各地已初步制定了山区建设方案，这个省也在去年冬季成立了山区建设委员会。
　　山东：号召干部到山区安家落户
    新华社济南24日电　山东省山区工作会议决定，要想尽千方百计，帮助山区人民加速发展生产。
    从18日到23日举行的这次会议确定，今后山东省发展山区生产的方针是：加强领导，全面规划，综合进行水土保持工作，贯彻农、林、牧相结合的方针，全面发展山区生产，从多方面增加山区人民的收入。具体要求在三五年内做到水土保持工作初具规模，基本上制止水土流失的继续加深，使山区人民能过够吃、够烧、够穿、够用的生活。
    会议着重研究了今后如何加强山区工作的领导，认为，在全部或大部是山区的地区，应该把发展山区生产作为经常的中心任务。在有一部分山区的地区，也应该有一定的党、政负责人分工专管山区建设工作。各级领导机关的负责人应该经常深入山区，调查研究，倾听山区人民的意见和要求，同时要号召干部到山区去安家落户，帮助建设山区。目前各地首先应该通过调查研究，发动群众制定全面发展山区生产的计划。在制定计划中，既要有长远发展的观点，又要从当前山区人民的迫切要求出发；既要有三五年的计划，又要有分期实施的小段计划。会议指出，一方面，各地都已经有了一些建设山区的好典型，应该认真地总结它们的经验，加以推广；另一方面，各地还应该在山区设立工作基点，继续创造建设山区的经验。最后，会议还要求全省各个经济部门和文化、卫生等部门以最大的热情支持山区人民发展生产。
    山东省的山区面积占全省总面积的三分之一以上，约有一千三百多万人口。这些山区，大部分是革命老根据地。近几年来，各个山区的生产都已经有相当的发展，粮食的单位面积产量一般比抗日战争前提高了40％左右，在发展林业、水利、畜牧、蚕茧等方面也都有了一定的成绩。一部分生产发展较快的山区，人民生活水平有了显著的提高。但是山区的生产发展还很不平衡，并且比较迟缓。不少山区人民在生产上和生活上还有某些困难。个别在战争期间受到严重摧残的地方，人民生活水平还比较低。
