Xinhua News Agency, London, March 20th: British shipbuilding workers continued their strike on the 19th. At the same time, leaders of the forty unions affiliated with the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions announced that two and a half million engineering workers would stage rolling "guerrilla" strikes from the 23rd. If their demand for a 10% wage increase is not met by April 6th, they will hold a nationwide general strike.

According to the "Financial Times", the construction of 350 new ships and the repair of a large number of old ships has now completely stopped.

Xinhua News Agency, Hamburg, March 20th: The West German Metalworkers' Union resolved on the 19th that West German shipbuilding workers will not accept repair work transferred due to the strike of British shipbuilding workers. This resolution was made in response to a call from the International Metalworkers' Federation.

Xinhua News Agency, March 20th: According to a TASS report, the Danish newspapers "Social-Demokraten" and "Land og Folk" reported on the 19th that the Danish Metalworking Industry Workers' Union warned the Employers' Confederation that they might take action to support the strike of British shipbuilding workers. They demanded that employers not accept the part of the orders that were not completed due to the strike at British shipyards.

Norwegian Metalworkers' Union Secretary Hansen also stated in an interview with staff from the Norwegian newspaper "Friheten" that while British shipbuilding workers continue their strike, Norwegian workers will not do the work that should be completed in Britain.
