Xinhua News Agency, Bermuda, March 24th: The US and British heads of government continued to discuss "defense" issues on the 23rd. They still have differing opinions on methods of European "defense" and the issue of British troop withdrawals from West Germany.

According to Western news agencies, Britain, in order to save "defense" costs and ensure "economic soundness," advocates reducing some manpower and replacing it with atomic weapons and missiles; however, the United States is concerned that this will disrupt the "balance" in certain regions.

It is reported that on the issue of "defense," the heads of government of the two countries and their advisors also discussed arrangements for the two countries to jointly develop the latest supersonic rocket weapons.

The Middle East issue was also a major topic of discussion yesterday. According to news released by American news agencies, the heads of government of the two countries have reached an agreement on a series of temporary decisions concerning the Middle East issue. According to American sources, no action will be taken by either country until UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld reports on his talks with Nasser.

Reports say that the heads of government of the two countries have entrusted experts to study various aspects of the Middle East issue, including the issue of laying a new oil pipeline in the Middle East. The suggestion to lay a new oil pipeline from Iraq to Turkey was originally proposed by Britain during the first day of the meeting.

The Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom and the United States also discussed the North African issue yesterday morning, but detailed information was not disclosed.

　　美英两国政府首脑
　　在欧洲“防务”问题上仍有分歧
    据新华社24日讯　百慕大消息：英美两国政府首脑23日继续讨论“防务”问题，他们对欧洲“防务”的办法以及英国从西德撤军问题，依然意见分歧。
    据西方通讯社透露，英国为了节约“防务”费用以保证“经济健全”，主张裁减一部分人力而用原子武器和导弹来代替；但是美国担心这会打乱某些地区的“均势”。
    据报道，在“防务”问题上，两国政府首脑以及顾问们还讨论了两国共同发展最新超音速火箭武器的安排问题。
    中东问题也是昨天讨论的主要问题。美国通讯社传出来的消息说，两国政府首脑已经就一系列有关中东问题的暂时性决定达成了协议。据美国人士说，在联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德报告他同纳赛尔会谈情况以前，两国不会采取什么行动。
    有消息说，两国政府首脑把中东问题的多方面委托给专家们去研究，包括关于在中东敷设一条新油管的问题在内。敷设一条从伊拉克到土耳其的新油管的建议，原是英国在第一天会议中提出来的。
    英美两国外交部长昨天上午还讨论过北非问题，详细情况没有透露。
