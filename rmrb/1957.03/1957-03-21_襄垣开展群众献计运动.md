Xiangyuan Launches Mass Suggestion Campaign

(Our report) Recently, the Xiangyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province discovered from the more than one hundred practical and feasible methods for increasing production proposed by members of the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan Township that the masses had many avenues for striving for a bumper harvest this year. This led to the proposal, at the enlarged meeting of county, township, and cooperative cadres held from March 12th to 16th, to launch a mass suggestion campaign throughout the county. More than 400 cadres responded enthusiastically and offered more than 1,300 suggestions at the meeting, of which 943 were concrete measures to ensure a bumper harvest, 234 were methods to consolidate the cooperatives, and 199 were suggestions to improve leadership. After examination and research, 422 were found to be of reference value, and 932 could be adopted immediately. These suggestions have already been tested, and if the leadership organizes them properly, they can produce even greater results. Chen Ermin, director of the Gongnong Lianmeng Cooperative in Nan'e Township, suggested that to ensure a bumper harvest, fertilizer is the most important thing. The usual practice is to apply dried chicken, sheep, and horse manure directly to the fields, but if it is composted for 40 days before use, the fertilizer effect will be three times greater than that of dry manure. Zhao Youda, director of the Qiangji Township Agricultural Cooperative, said that they have 160 mu of mountain land, but because it is too far away and the mountains are large, no one cultivates it. This year, the cooperative can collectively organize members to plant it, which can increase grain production by 30,000 jin. Twenty-six of the county's twenty-nine townships have revised their previously conservative production increase targets. The cadres all said, "Once we mobilize back home, the members will surely have even more production increase methods than we can think of." This has laid a solid foundation for the county to increase grain production by more than 10 million jin compared to last year.

　　襄垣开展群众献计运动
    本报讯　最近，中共山西省襄垣县委从城关乡前进农业社社员们提出的百余条切实可行的增产办法里，发现了群众中有许许多多争取今年农业大丰收的门路，使在3月12日到16日召开的县乡社三级干部扩大会议上，提出在全县范围内开展群众性的献计运动。四百多名干部首先热烈响应，在会上献计一千三百多条，其中九百四十三条是保证大丰收的具体措施，二百三十四条是巩固社的办法，一百九十九条是改进领导的建议；经审查研究，里面有四百二十二条有参考价值，九百三十二条都可供当前采用。这些建议，都已经经过试验，只需领导加以组织，就能产生更大的效果。南俄乡工农联盟社社主任陈二民提出：保证大丰收，首先靠肥料，一般习惯把积的鸡羊粪骡马粪干上到地里，如果把它沤四十天以后用，比干粪肥气要大三倍。强计乡农业社主任赵有堂说，他们那里有一百六十亩山地，因为太远，山又大，无人耕种，今年可以集体组织社员去种植，能增产粮食三万斤。全县二十九个乡，有二十六个乡都修订了看来比较保守的增产指标。干部们都表示：回去一动员，社员的增产办法准比我们想的还要多。这就为全县比去年增产一千万斤以上的粮食奠定了可靠的基础。
