Two Suggestions on Cultural Work
	Speech by Zeng Zhaoyu
	I am honored and happy to have participated in the two enlarged Supreme State Conferences and listened to Chairman Mao's two cordial speeches. I will certainly follow Chairman Mao's teachings and do my job well.
	I fully endorse the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and other leaders.
	Today I want to talk about two issues.

	Importance of Cultural Relics and Museum Work
		Both of these tasks are urgent, and the serious situation where the work lags behind actual needs should be noted; it is hoped that relevant departments and local Party organizations will strengthen their leadership over archaeological work.
	First, concerning cultural relics work and museum work. Last year, the Ministry of Culture convened a national conference of cultural bureau directors, and according to the general guideline for cultural work proposed by the Party Central Committee – to establish a socialist national new culture – it gave specific instructions on various tasks of the cultural departments. This greatly encouraged us. We believe that in implementing this general guideline, the protection, excavation, and organization of national material and spiritual cultural heritage, as well as the work of museums in collecting these relics and using exhibitions to make them effective tools for educating the masses and providing scientific research materials, should have their proper place. In the report of that conference of the Ministry of Culture, these two types of work were also mentioned, but if they are placed in a more prominent position, and organically linked with the general guideline, it can make the national people more clearly aware of these two types of work, and give more support. Now, when the country is concentrating its main strength on economic construction, and there are many important tasks to be done in cultural construction, we cannot put cultural relics work and museum work in a very important position. However, both types of work are urgent. Cultural relics work is coordinated with economic construction. In production and construction, the discovery of a large number of cultural sites and the excavation of cultural relics, if not properly handled, will result in the loss of countless precious historical and cultural data, and once lost, they will not return. The collection work of museums is coordinated with socialist transformation. In the transformation, the face of people's lives changes very quickly. If the material data is not collected in a timely manner, then the history left to future generations will be a vague concept. Therefore, it is still necessary to give appropriate importance and support to these two types of work now.
	Our Party and government attach importance to cultural relics. In the past seven years, the former Government Administration Council and the State Council have issued as many as seven decrees, instructions, and notices related to the protection of cultural relics, which have played a huge role. However, due to China's long history and particularly rich underground treasures, and the extreme lack of archaeological talent (according to the statistics of the National Archaeological Work Conference last year, there are only more than 400 people in the country who can do archaeological excavation), an astonishing situation has emerged in which the work lags far behind actual needs. Taking the Yellow River Reservoir project as an example, according to preliminary surveys, there are nearly 400 ancient cultural sites within the scope of the Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia reservoir projects alone. Even if all the archaeological forces in the country were concentrated to excavate, it would take five years to complete less than 10%. The situation of one project is like this, so how about the whole country? One can imagine. Today, we cannot demand a large increase in personnel and expand the archaeological team, but this serious situation should attract the attention of all parties.
	In addition, there is such a contradiction in our historical science circles: on the one hand, historical science workers are arguing endlessly about the periodization of ancient society, waiting anxiously for underground materials to solve the problem; on the other hand, a large number of unearthed objects are being destroyed in various regions every day, and no one is going to excavate and sort them out; on the one hand, the only few archaeological workers have not been well organized to give play to their collective strength. This situation should be improved. The reason is mainly because the national archaeological work lacks unified organizational leadership and overall planning. It is hoped that relevant institutions will pay attention to this issue and gradually resolve it, and it is also hoped that Party organizations in various regions will strengthen their leadership.

	Appropriate Adjustment of Royalties
		Giving the same remuneration and royalties to things that should be written within one's own duties or amateur creations, and the phenomenon of excessive royalties, has an adverse effect on scientific practice work and university teaching work.
	Second, the issue of royalties. Since liberation, whether it is scientific papers, literary works, or general sporadic reports, all publications in journals have been remunerated. This is a good thing to encourage writing and promote academic contention. However, there are some inappropriate places in the control. For example, regardless of whether it is something that should be written within one's own duties or an amateur creation, the same remuneration is given. Furthermore, the royalties are too high. The current royalties are four to five times higher than before the Anti-Japanese War, and are unbalanced compared with wages. As a result, the following unhealthy phenomena have occurred in the scientific and higher education circles: (1) Some scientific workers are unwilling to do practical work, and some people teaching in universities are unwilling to spend more time on teaching, but only want to stay in their rooms and bury themselves in reading and writing articles; (2) Some cadres are unwilling to do administrative work, and some people are even unwilling to do technical work, but only want to do research and write papers; (3) Some business cadres are unwilling to delve into research, but are busy publishing articles. Articles that can be written shorter are deliberately lengthened, lowering the standard of scientific papers; (4) Everyone wants to do research, resulting in a purely technical point of view that does not ask about politics and is divorced from reality; (5) Some publications inevitably are shoddy, wasting paper, ink, and manpower, and even creating a bad impression internationally. Giving royalties was originally intended to promote scientific research work, but like this, it actually lowers the level of scientific work, and even affects scientific practice work and university teaching work, which is more harm than good.
	Now, literary and artistic workers are gradually moving towards specialization, preparing to not take wages and only take royalties. And some of our scientific workers take both wages and a lot of royalties, which is not very appropriate. I know several comrades whose annual royalties far exceed their wages, and they themselves think it is unreasonable. At a time when the country is streamlining and saving, it is necessary to provide help in times of need, but it seems unnecessary to add flowers to the brocade. Moreover, scientific research that is of great importance to national defense, the national economy, and the people's welfare, such as atomic energy, agronomy, and medicine, requires researchers to put in long-term and huge labor to obtain results, and the publication of the results is sometimes just a short report. But other people, such as our historical science workers, due to the richness of underground materials and literature, and people's traditional preferences, write articles that are tens of thousands of words long. Writing articles is good, but the remuneration is several times more than those who do experimental work, and it is not very reasonable in our own eyes.
	Therefore, I suggest that for scientific papers or reports that the author must write within his own duties, only appropriate royalties should be given to encourage them, or bonuses should be awarded to high-quality papers within a certain period of time. For amateur writing, royalties can be given according to higher standards. True scientists will be happy to contribute their research results to the motherland and to all mankind, and will not refuse to publish the results because the royalties are less or there are no royalties. A few years ago and recently, responsible comrades of several research institutes of the Academy of Sciences and many senior researchers of other scientific research institutions and universities have had the same views as me, so I put it forward, hoping that relevant institutions will consider it.
	The above opinions may be subjective and one-sided. Please criticize and correct me, all members and comrades. (Attached picture)

    关于文化工作的两点意见
    曾昭燏的发言
    我很光荣地、幸福地参加了两次扩大的最高国务会议，听到了毛主席两次亲切的讲话，我一定遵循毛主席的教导，做好我的工作。
    我对周总理、李富春副总理和其他首长的报告完全拥护。
    我今天要谈两个问题。
    重视文物和博物馆工作
    这两项工作都具有紧急性，工作落后于实际需要的严重情况应引起注意；希望有关部门和各地党组织加强对考古工作的领导。
    第一是有关文物工作和博物馆工作问题。去年文化部召开了全国文化局长会议，根据党中央所提出的文化工作的总方针——建立社会主义的民族的新文化，对文化部门的各项工作作了具体的指示，这使我们得到很大的鼓舞。我们认为在贯彻这个总方针的具体工作中，保护、发掘、整理民族物质文化和精神文化遗产的文物工作，与收藏这些遗物并通过陈列展览方法，使它们成为教育广大人民群众的有效工具和提供科学研究资料的博物馆工作，是应有其适当地位的。在文化部那次会议的报告中，也曾提到这两种工作，但假使将它们放在更明确的地位，使它们和总方针有机地联系起来，可以使全国人民对这两种工作的认识更清楚一些，给予的支持更多一些。在现在国家集中主要力量进行经济建设的时候，在文化建设事业中还有许多重要工作要做的时候，我们不能把文物工作和博物馆工作提到怎样重要的地位。但两种工作都是有其紧急性的。文物工作是和经济建设相配合的，在生产建设中，大量文化遗址的发现和文物的出土，如不去清理，则无数的珍贵的历史文化资料遭受损失，损失了便不会回来了。博物馆的征集工作是和社会主义改造相配合的，在改造中，人民生活的面貌改变得非常迅速，如果不及时地将实物资料收集起来，则这一段历史留给后人的将是个模糊的概念。因此，在现在对这两种工作给予适当的重视和支持，还是必要的。
    我们党和政府对于文物是重视的，七年来，前政务院和国务院颁发的有关保护文物的法令、指示、通知达七个之多，起了巨大的作用。但由于我国历史悠久，地下宝藏特别丰富，而考古人才极端缺乏（据去年全国考古工作会议的统计，全国能做考古发掘工作的不过四百余人），于是出现工作远落后于实际需要的惊人情况。以黄河水库工程为例，经初步勘察，仅在三门峡、刘家峡两水库工程范围内，就有古代文化遗址近四百处，集中全国考古力量来发掘，费五年的时间，做不到10％。一个工程的情况如此，全国怎样，可想而知。我们今日不能要求大量增加人员，扩大考古队伍，但这种严重情形，是应引起各方面的注意的。
    此外，我们历史科学界还存在着这样的矛盾：一方面历史科学工作者对古代社会分期问题争论不休，眼睁睁地等待着地下的资料来解决问题；一方面各个地区每日都有大量的出土物在毁坏，没有人去发掘整理；一方面仅有的少数的考古工作者还没有好好地组织起来，发挥集体力量。这种情形，是应予改进的。推其原因，主要是由于全国的考古工作，没有统一的组织领导，没有通盘的筹划。希望有关机构重视而逐渐解决这问题，也希望各地的党组织加强领导。
    适当调整稿费
    不管本身职务内应写的东西或是业余创作一律给予同样报酬、稿费偏高等现象，对科学实践工作和大学教学工作有不利的影响。
    第二是稿费问题。解放以来，无论科学论文、文艺作品以及一般零星的报道，凡在刊物上发表的，都有报酬。这样鼓励写作，提倡学术界的百家争鸣，原是很好的。但在掌握上有不够妥当的地方。例如不管是本身职务内应写的东西或是业余创作，一概给予同样的报酬。再则稿费有偏高的现象，现在的稿费比抗日战争前提高四至五倍，和工资相比，失去均衡。因之，在科学界和高等教育界中，发生以下一些不健康的现象：（一）有的科学工作者不愿做实际的工作，有的在大学教书的人不愿在教学上多花时间，只愿关在房间里埋头读书写文章；（二）有些干部不愿做行政事务工作，有的人连技术工作也不愿做，只愿做研究，写论文；（三）有的业务干部不肯深入钻研，只忙着发表文章，文章可以写得短些的，偏要拉长，降低科学论文的水准；（四）大家都想做研究，产生不问政治、脱离实际的单纯技术观点；（五）出版的刊物有的不免粗制滥造，浪费纸墨与人力，甚至在国际上造成不好的印象。给稿费本为提倡科学研究工作，像这样反而降低科学工作的水准，甚至于影响科学的实践工作和大学的教学工作，则为益反损了。
    现在文艺工作者逐渐走入专业化的道路，准备不拿工资，专拿稿费。而我们科学工作者有些人既拿工资，又拿很多的稿费，是不大妥当的。我知道好几位同志每年所拿的稿费，远超过他们的工资，他们自己也认为不合理。在国家这样精简节约的时候，雪里送炭是必要的，锦上添花则似乎不必。而且科学研究，对国防、国民经济、人民福利有重大关系的，如原子能、农学、医学，研究工作者要付出长期的、巨大的劳动来，才能得出结果，而结果的发表，有时不过一篇短短的报道。但另外一些人，例如我们历史科学工作者，由于地下资料和文献资料的丰富以及人们传统的爱好，一写文章，动辄数万言。写文章是好的，但所得的报酬比做实验工作的人多好几倍，在我们自己看来，也是不太合理的。
    为此，我建议：科学论文或报告，是作者本身职务内所必须写的，为了鼓励，只适当地给予稿费，或对质量较高的论文在一定时期内评给奖金，其业余写作，可按较高的标准给稿费。真正的科学家一定乐于将自己研究的成果贡献给祖国，贡献给全人类，而不会因为稿费少了或没有稿费而不肯将结果发表。在几年以前和最近，科学院好几个研究所的负责同志以及其他科学研究机关和大学的好些高级研究人员都和我有同样的看法，因此我提出来，希望有关机构考虑。
    以上意见，可能是主观片面的，请各位委员和各位同志批评指正。（附图片）
