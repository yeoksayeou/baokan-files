    Lai Maosheng, a member of the Renshan Agricultural Cooperative in Pinghe County, Fujian Province, bought three duck eggs from the county farm in May last year and hatched them into ducklings. From June to November of last year, each duck weighed up to twelve jin and three liang. These ducks have snow-white feathers and like to eat cooked sweet potatoes mixed with rice bran and fresh green grass. The eggs they lay weigh about four liang each. (Sun Dexian)
