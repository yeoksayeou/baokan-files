Handicraft Cooperatives Have Potential
Shanghai Handicraft Production Cooperative Union Director Wang Liang

In the increase production and practice economy movement, some Shanghai handicraft production cooperatives have already achieved preliminary results. The Shanghai Leather United Cooperative's subsidiary tanning, shoe, and leather goods industries' target for saving raw materials in the first quarter was 80,000 yuan, and in January alone, it had already reached more than 28,000 yuan. The Garment Cooperative promoted centralized cutting, adjusted pattern arrangements, and increased size ranges, saving more than 30,000 meters of fabric. Industries such as cardboard boxes, paper bags, and toys are using konjac flour to replace wheat flour paste, which can save more than 180,000 jin of wheat flour in the first quarter.

These cooperatives were able to achieve the above results mainly because they conscientiously implemented the spirit of "inspecting, researching, and improving simultaneously" proposed by the Municipal United Cooperative. The approach of these cooperatives is generally as follows:

I. Through comparison, understand the situation. For example, the Leather United Cooperative compared the existing material consumption of the tanning, shoe, and leather goods industries. For a pair of plain toe-cap, leather-soled, leather-heeled men's shoes, the fourth shoe cooperative used 1.5 chi of upper leather, while the seventh shoe cooperative used only 1.35 chi; for the sole leather used, the sixteenth shoe cooperative used 31 liang, while the fifth shoe cooperative used only 26 liang. For the 204 ticket holders produced by the leather goods cooperative, the highest material consumption per dozen was 7.4 chi, while the lowest was only 6.8 chi. For the chemical raw materials used in tanning, the white oil used per piece of leather was 12 liang at the highest and only 8 liang at the lowest. The amount of sulfuric acid used was as high as 15 liang at the most and only 9 liang at the least. These products have been tested and chemically verified to prove that the quality of finished products using less raw materials is better than those using more materials.

II. Through typical experiments, mobilize the masses. After grasping the basic situation, the Leather United Cooperative, based on the characteristics that handicraftsmen have always lacked unified standards for material consumption and each master has their own method, began to conduct in-depth inspections of the material consumption and product quality of various cooperatives (groups) in October of last year, organized technical personnel to research, and selected the seventeenth shoe cooperative, the Zhabei tanning group, the fifth tanning cooperative, and the fourteenth leather goods cooperative, which had more serious problems, for typical experiments. They helped to study the formula and layout of materials, organized production, adjusted technical forces, divided labor according to work procedures, and first selected a production team to conduct a pilot project, and then promoted it throughout the cooperative after gaining experience. At the same time, in conjunction with the municipal cooperative's laboratory, they studied the differences in the quality of finished products produced using different amounts of chemical raw materials, and finally summarized the experience, organized professional meetings, and proposed preliminary medium standards. Then, they specifically distinguished the quality of products with different levels of material consumption. After unifying thinking and raising awareness, the above-mentioned products were organized by industry and exhibited in various cooperatives for touring exhibitions, discussions, and research. This is not only easy to understand, easy to implement, and convenient for cooperative members to learn, but also can achieve new development. For example, the quality of products produced by the seventeenth shoe cooperative has caught up with that of the Jiangning Shoe Cooperative through quality comparison meetings and learning from the strengths of the Jiangning Shoe Cooperative. After being inspired, the members of the fourteenth leather goods cooperative not only improved the method of drawing materials, but also used scrap leather to make suspender loops. More than 1,000 chi of leather were saved in one month.

III. Repeated ideological education, strengthening the socialist concept of the whole, improving class consciousness, and enhancing confidence in overcoming difficulties. The Cultural United Cooperative went through a difficult ideological education process to promote the substitution of konjac flour for wheat flour. As early as before 1955, the private Zhao Tianfu Box Factory had used this substitute, but it was not continued because this substitute did not bring much benefit to the producers. For example, one jin of high-quality konjac flour costs 9 jiao 7 fen, while one jin of special wheat flour only costs 2 jiao; one jin of konjac flour is equivalent to five jin of wheat flour, and it is not as convenient to use as wheat flour. In addition, at the beginning of use, it is necessary to change production habits, which will also reduce production efficiency. For example, the Hongkou Cardboard Box Cooperative reduced its production from 300 boxes per person per day to 250 boxes when using konjac flour to replace wheat flour, and it took a month to recover to the original output. Under the patient education of the Cultural United Cooperative, and after repeatedly explaining the consistency of the cooperative's interests with the interests of the country, emphasizing the importance of saving wheat flour, and actively organizing experience exchange to help overcome the difficulties in the use process, it was gradually promoted. Experience has proved that changing an old habit is difficult, but if we can rely closely on the masses and mobilize the vast number of cooperative members, the difficulties can be completely overcome.

Facts have proved that the potential for increasing production and practicing economy in handicraft production cooperatives is considerable. For example, the ninth shoe cooperative could only clamp 25 to 30 pairs of shoe uppers with each jin of iron nails in the past, but now it can clamp 90 pairs, and the monthly consumption has been reduced from 95 jin of iron nails to 25 jin. Recently, the tenth shoe cooperative reused the iron nails that had been used three times to nail the heels, saving a lot of iron nails. The tanning cooperative changed the past practice of cutting edges and hides, and each piece of leather can be increased by 5 cun. Nine tanning cooperatives (groups) can increase production by 1,500 to 2,000 chi in one month, and it is estimated that each cooperative can accumulate 108,000 yuan more throughout the year.

There are 1,632 cooperatives (groups) in Shanghai, and since the launch of the increase production and practice economy, only a few cooperatives (groups) have achieved results. The experience of the above-mentioned industries is worth learning. In the increase production and practice economy movement, even a needle, a thread, or a tael of steel, if a little achievement can be made, it will encourage the masses to move forward step by step. The material foundation of handicraft cooperatives is still extremely weak, so increasing production and practicing economy in the handicraft cooperative system has particularly important political and economic significance. We hope that all members will concentrate their wisdom, think of all possible ways, ensure product quality, save raw materials, and achieve increased production.

　　手工业合作社是有潜力的
　　上海市手工业生产合作社联合社主任　王良
    在增产节约运动中，上海市部分手工业生产合作社已经取得了初步成绩。皮革联社所属的制革、皮鞋、皮件三个行业第一季度节约原材料的指标是八万元，1月份已经达到二万八千多元。服装社推广了集中裁剪，调整样板排列和增加档号等经验，节约三万多公尺布料。纸盒、纸袋、玩具等行业，用磨芋粉代面粉浆糊，第一季度内可节约面粉十八万多斤。
    这些合作社能够取得以上的成绩，主要原因在于认真地贯彻了市联社提出的“边检查、边研究、边改进”的精神。这些社的做法，一般是这样的：
    一、通过对比，摸清情况。如皮革联社对制革、皮鞋、皮件三个行业，就现有的生产用料情况作了比较。一双平包头皮底、皮跟男式鞋用的面革，在第四皮鞋社是一尺五寸，而第七皮鞋社只用一尺三寸五分；所用底皮，在第十六皮鞋社是三十一两，而第五皮鞋社只用二十六两。皮件社生产的二零四票夹，每打用料最高的是七尺四寸，最低的只用六尺八寸。制革用的化工原料，每张皮用的白油，高的是十二两，最低的只用八两。使用的硫酸量，最多的达十五两，最低的只用九两。这些产品经过检验和化验证明，使用原材料少的成品质量，反而比多用材料的好。
    二、通过典型实验，发动群众。皮革联社在掌握了基本情况后，又根据手工业者一向用料没有统一标准，一个师傅一样作法的特点，从去年10月间即开始深入的检查各类社（组）的用料和产品质量，组织技术人员研究，选择了问题较严重的第十七皮鞋社，闸北制革小组、第五制革社，第十四皮件社等单位进行典型试验。帮助研究配料、划料，组织生产，调整技术力量，按工序分工，并先选择一个生产小组作试点，在取得经验以后，全社推广。同时同市社的化验室结合，研究用不同分量的化工原料所出成品质量的差异，最后总结经验，组织专业会议，提出初步的中等标准。再以用料高低不同的产品，具体分辨质量好坏。在统一思想提高认识以后，即将上列产品分别按行业组织到各社巡回展出，讨论研究。这样不但易懂、易行、便于社员学习，并且可以得到新的发展。如第十七皮鞋社，通过质量比较会，学习了江宁皮鞋社的长处，产品质量已经赶上了江宁社。十四皮件社在社员得到启发后，不但改进划料方法，并且利用碎皮做吊带搭头。一个月就节约了皮料一千多尺。
    三、反复进行思想教育，加强社会主义的整体观念，提高阶级觉悟，增强克服困难的信心。文化联社推广磨芋粉代面粉就经过了一段艰苦的思想教育过程。早在1955年以前私营赵天福制盒厂就采用过这种代用品，因为这种代用品对生产者利益不多就没有继续采用。如一斤上等麻芋粉要九角七分，一斤专用面粉只要二角；一斤麻芋粉顶五斤面粉，使用起来又没有面粉便当。加以在开始使用的时候，要改变生产习惯，还会降低生产效率。如虹口纸盒社用磨芋粉代替面粉，每人每天由三百只的产量降到二百五十只，经过一个月才恢复到原有产量。这一工作，在文化联社的耐心教育下，经过反复说明合作社跟国家利益的一致，强调节约面粉的重要，并且积极组织经验交流，协助克服使用过程的困难，才逐步推广。经验证明，改变一个旧习惯是艰苦的，但是如能够紧紧依靠群众，把广大社员发动起来，困难是完全可以克服的。
    事实证明，手工业生产合作社增产节约的潜力是相当大的，如第九皮鞋社过去每斤铁钉只能钳二十五到三十双鞋帮，现在达到九十双，每月从九十五斤铁钉降到二十五斤。近来，第十皮鞋社将用过三遍的铁钉，再用来钉后跟，节约了很多铁钉。制革社改变过去裁边、皮爪皮的作法，每张皮可增加五寸，九个制革社（组），一个月就能增产一千五百到二千尺，全年预计各社可以多积累十万八千元。
    上海市的合作社（组）有一千六百三十二个，自开展增产节约以来，取得成绩的社（组）还是少数。上列几个行业的经验是值得学习的。在增产节约运动中，那怕是一针、一线、一两钢铁，如能作出点滴成绩，就会鼓舞群众，步步前进。手工业合作社的物质基础还是极为薄弱的，因而增产节约在手工业合作社系统中，更具有特别重大的政治意义和经济意义。我们希望全体社员集中智慧，想尽办法，保证产品质量，节约原材料，实现增产。
