The meeting passed a resolution expressing a sincere welcome to the People’s Socialist Party to participate in the new government that the Communist Party of India will soon organize in Kerala.

The resolution guarantees that the Kerala government led by the Communist Party of India "will spare no effort to eliminate corruption and provide an efficient and honest administration based on the best democratic traditions." This government will, within its scope of authority, study all possible ways to improve the material and cultural standards of the people of Kerala.

The elections in Kerala have now concluded. In the state legislative assembly, the Communist Party of India won sixty seats, the Congress Party forty-three seats, the People's Socialist Party nine seats, the Muslim League eight seats, and independents six seats. Five of the independent seats support the Communist Party of India, giving the Communist Party of India an absolute majority in the state assembly of one hundred and twenty-six seats.

According to the Indian Constitution, the Communist Party, having obtained a majority of seats in the Kerala legislature, will be invited by the Governor to form the state government. Namboodiripad will therefore serve as the Chief Minister of India's first state government led by Communists.
