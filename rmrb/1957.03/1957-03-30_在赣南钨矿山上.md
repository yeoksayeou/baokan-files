　　Our car sped along a highway in the towering mountains of southern Jiangxi, heading towards a renowned tungsten mine.
　　Outside the window flashed a mix of red and green bamboo groves and plum trees, with distant mountain ranges stretching like ribbons. In this beautiful southern Jiangxi mountain region lies the treasure of our motherland—tungsten ore.
　　The tungsten mines of southern Jiangxi are distributed across nearly twenty counties, including Dayu, Chongyi, Nankang, and Yudu. The breadth of the mining area and the size of the reserves are rare in the world. Before liberation, approximately ten thousand tons of tungsten sand were mined here annually on average. Back then, the official Jiangxi Tungsten Mining Company acquired all the tungsten sand produced here and transported the vast majority of it to American imperialists. The smuggling of tungsten sand did not cease until the eve of the liberation of southern Jiangxi in 1949. In Ganzhou, the Jiangxi Tungsten Mining Company loaded tungsten sand gathered from nearby mines onto airplanes. In urgent times, several or even dozens of planes flew from Ganzhou to Kowloon every day.
    Before liberation, all production in the southern Jiangxi tungsten mining area relied on manual extraction. Hundreds of small manual mines were scattered throughout the region. Up until liberation, the southern Jiangxi tungsten mining area, which had been mined for over thirty years, did not have a single mine with modern mechanical equipment.
　　Now, the southern Jiangxi tungsten mining area is undergoing tremendous changes.

　　When we were in Ganzhou, a leading comrade from the Central South Tungsten Mining Bureau, which manages tungsten production in this area, told us: Tungsten mining here is now advancing towards mechanization. Over 80% of the heavy mining and tunneling work has been replaced by pneumatic drills instead of hand hammers and chisels. Modernized mechanical ore dressing plants have been established in the mining area. With the development of production, the lives of the miners are also improving greatly.
　　The Pangu Mountain tungsten mine we visited is one of the mines in southern Jiangxi that has basically implemented mechanized production.

　　In the Pangu Mountain mining area, new buildings stand along the foot of the mountain: the employee hospital, shops, post and telecommunications bureau, club, employee dormitories... On a small hilltop, there are rows of neat factory buildings, which is the ore dressing plant. Regular vibrations emanate from there, the sound of rod mills grinding ore. Buckets full of ore move along an aerial ropeway between two hilltops. High-voltage power lines run from the foot of the mountain all the way up to Pangu Mountain. All of this has been built in the last two or three years. Below the ore dressing plant on the hillside, workers are still clearing ground and building roads. A concentrating workshop will be built here this year.
　　The mine party secretary, the mine director, and the editors of the mine workers' newspaper told us that this place used to be a wilderness. The ancient, towering pine trees, the winding mountain paths covered in weeds—in the foggy mornings and dim evenings, it was easy to lose your way. Now, at dusk, the mine is brightly lit. The construction of the mine really started from scratch. Before liberation, this tungsten mine was entirely mined manually, leaving us with no infrastructure whatsoever, not even a proper tunnel. Now, the main tasks from mining to ore dressing have been mechanized. In the past few years, in addition to building a modern mechanical ore dressing plant, several tunnels, each over a thousand meters long, have been excavated on Pangu Mountain. A main fan ventilation room, an air compressor room, and a pump room have been built... Underground mining has entirely replaced manual rock drilling with pneumatic drills. The mine party secretary knew that this was our first visit to a southern Jiangxi tungsten mine, and said to us, "The tunnels back then were so small that someone as tall as me had to squeeze sideways to get in. Now, the tunnels we've excavated, you can walk in with your head held high without worry! They're even equipped with a long string of electric lights, like a road."

　　We climbed Pangu Mountain and visited several newly excavated tunnels, which were indeed very wide. The entrance to the tunnels resembled the entrances to railway tunnels we often see, only a bit shorter, but still tall enough to walk straight in. Inside, every few steps there was an electric light, truly like a small street. Walking deep inside the tunnel, the air remained fresh, with no unusual sensation. While visiting the new tunnels, we also saw old tunnel entrances scattered all over the mountainside, looking like animal burrows, some almost like cracks in the rocks. Because mining in these old tunnels was very unsafe and damaged resources, production has now been completely stopped.

　　In the newly excavated tunnel, we arrived at a mining site and observed the miners using pneumatic drills. It was a curved stone cave, large enough to accommodate a dozen people. Carbide lamps hung on the stone walls. Three miners were operating a pneumatic drill together. One driller gripped the drill tightly, pointing the drill bit at the stone wall above their heads (it was white, hard quartzite, with tungsten ore embedded within the rock). When the drill started, the drill bit quickly bored into the rock. In no time, a hole was drilled. Explosives were placed in the drilled hole, and the ore was blasted down. Now, using pneumatic drills, a shift (three people operating one drill for eight hours) can generally drill fifty-four holes (each one meter deep). This amount of work would have required two miners working non-stop for more than ten days and nights using the old manual method.

### 在赣南钨矿山上

　　在赣南钨矿山上
　　新华社记者  金凯  王介方
    汽车在江西南部丛山峻岭里的一条公路上奔跑，我们正在向这里的一个著名的钨矿山前进。
    车窗外不时掠过红绿相杂的竹丛和梅花树，远远的是绵延如带的山峦。在这美丽的赣南山区，埋藏着祖国的宝藏——钨矿。
    江西南部的钨矿分布在大庾、崇义、南康、雩都等近二十来个县内，矿区之广、蕴藏量之大为世界上所罕有。解放以前，每年大约平均在这里可以挖出上万吨钨砂。那时候官办的江西钨矿业有限公司收购了这里的全部钨砂以后，把绝大部分的钨砂运给了美帝国主义。钨砂的偷运，一直到1949年赣南解放前夕都还没有停止。在赣州，江西钨矿业有限公司把附近矿山上集中来的钨砂装上飞机，紧急时候，总有几架、十几架每天从赣州往九龙飞去。
    解放以前，赣南钨矿区的全部生产是靠手工开采的。那时候全区散布着几百个小手工矿场。到解放前止，已经开采了三十多年的赣南钨矿区内没有一个有近代化机械设备的矿场。
    现在，赣南钨矿区正在经历着巨大的变化。
    我们在赣州的时候，管理这一带钨矿生产的中南钨矿局的一位负责同志告诉我们：现在这里的钨矿开采正在向机械化方向前进。繁重的采矿、巷道开拓工作已有80％以上用风钻代替了手锤凿岩。一个个近代化的机械选矿厂已经在矿区里建立了起来。随着生产的发展，矿工的生活也正在大大地改善。
    我们所去的盘古山钨矿，就是赣南钨矿中已经基本上实行机械化生产的矿山之一。
    在盘古山钨矿区，沿着山脚，出现的是一幢幢崭新的房屋，这里是职工医院、商店、邮电局、俱乐部、职工宿舍……。在一个小山头上，有一排排整齐的厂房，那是选矿厂，从那里传来了有规律的震动声音，这是棒磨机在棒磨矿石。装满着矿石的一只一只矿斗，正在两个山头之间上空顺着架空索道移动。高压电线从山脚下一直架到盘古山上。这些都是近两、三年内建筑起来的。在选矿厂下面山坡上，工人们还正在开土修路，今年在这里还要建一个精选车间。
    矿山党委书记、矿长、矿山工人报的编辑们告诉我们：这里原来是一片荒凉。那古老的高入云空的松树、杂草复盖着的弯曲的山间小道，在多雾的早晨，昏暗的黄昏，一出门，真会摸不着归路。现在，一到傍晚，矿山上就电灯通明，矿山的建设，真是白手起家的。在解放以前，这个钨矿完全由手工开采，没有留给我们任何建设，连一条像样的窿道都没有。现在，从矿山开采到选矿的主要工作都已经机械化了。几年来，除了建成一个近代化的机械选矿厂以外，在盘古山上已经开拓了好几条每条长达一千多公尺的窿道、建成了主扇抽风机房、压风机房、水泵房……。窿内开采已经全部用风钻代替了手工凿岩。矿山党委书记知道我们是第一次才到赣南钨矿山来，对我们说：“那时候的窿道，像我这样高个子，还得侧着膀子才能钻进去。现在，我们开拓的窿道，你们尽管放心抬着头走吧！里面还装着一大溜电灯，像条马路。”
    我们曾爬上盘古山，参观了几条新开拓的窿道，这里的确都很宽大。窿道口和我们常见的铁路上的隧道口相仿佛，只是要矮一些，但仍然可以直着身子走进去。里面每隔几步就装着一盏电灯，真的像一条小街道。在窿道内一直往深处走，空气仍然很清新，没有什么异样感觉。在我们参观新窿道同时，也见到了满山被凿掘得七零八落像野兽洞一样的旧窿道口，从外面看去，有的简直像一道石缝。因为在这些旧窿道内开采很不安全，也破坏资源，现在都已经全部停止生产了。
    在新开拓的窿道内，我们到了一个采矿场，参观了矿工们用风钻凿岩的情景。这里是一个弧形的石洞，容得下十几个人。石壁上挂着几盏电石灯，三个矿工正在协同操作着一台风钻。一个风钻工紧紧握住风钻，把钻头对准着头顶上的石壁（这是白莹莹的坚硬的石英岩，就在这岩石里面嵌藏着钨矿），风钻一开动，钻头迅速地向着岩石钻进去，不一会一个眼钻好了，炸药放进了钻眼里，矿石爆破了下来。现在用风钻凿岩一个台班（三个人操作一台风钻工作八小时）一般能打五十四（每个一公尺深）个洞眼。这些工作量如果用过去的手工开采，就得两个矿工不停的工作十多个昼夜。
