　　The Changes in Female Worker Lan Xiurong
　　Our Correspondent Zhang Jianhong
　　Lan Xiurong is an excellent female worker in the fine spinning workshop of the Zhengzhou No. 3 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory. Before August last year, she had been continuously评as an advanced producer. But after September, her production performance deteriorated. Not only did she not catch up with the advanced level, but she didn't even complete the general plan.
　　Why did Lan Xiurong's production situation become so bad?
　　It turned out that Lan Xiurong, nineteen years old, had recently become friends with Hu Guilan, a "dance enthusiast" in the factory. So Hu Guilan took her to dance halls in various government offices and enterprises in Zhengzhou, wandering around outside day and night. When she was on the night shift, she would get off work at six in the morning, sleep for at most four or five hours, and then go out to wander around. If she was on the day shift, she would come back even later every day. It was this excessive entertainment and frequent lack of sleep that made Lan Xiurong lose her original work vigor.
　　Lan Xiurong's changes aroused much discussion among the masses. Some people said: "Lan Xiurong's family is so poor that they have nothing, they eat窝窝头, and sometimes they can't even guarantee three meals a day. They couldn't afford to go to school, and only started night school after liberation. Why did she forget her roots so quickly?!" Others said: "Lan Xiurong was good before, her production was good, and her life was simple. She only recently joined the Youth League. Why did she become like this after making friends with Hu Guilan?" Her roommates also reflected: "Lan Xiurong is a really capable girl! She can cut, trim, and sew, and she's very smart! She used to make shoe soles at home to earn some money to supplement the family income. Why does she want to follow the dance enthusiast on this frivolous path now?" People couldn't quite figure out the details of Lan Xiurong's changes. In fact, Lan Xiurong's changes are not surprising.
　　As the saying goes, "It's easy to learn bad things, but it's hard to learn good things." Since she became friends with the "dance enthusiast," she has been constantly pursuing strange and elaborate clothing. In less than a month around the Spring Festival, she permed her hair twice, and bought two or three scarves in a row. When she had long ones, she added square ones; if she didn't like the color, she would buy another one. Buying a top cost more than 30 yuan, and sewing a pair of Western pants cost more than 10 yuan, and she even said: this material is shoddy. Of her monthly salary of 80 yuan, she often spent most of it on herself, and only sent a little living expenses to her family. In August, she registered for a cultural class, but dropped out automatically after attending a few days.
　　Lan Xiurong's situation is not an isolated case in this factory. According to the factory's recent rough statistics, more than 70% of the factory's more than 5,000 production workers are new workers. These people come from a wide range of backgrounds and have complex compositions. In addition to workers, peasants, and urban poor, there are also children who have just come out of the families of landlords, rich peasants, merchants, capitalists, hooligans, and former officials. Before entering the factory, most of them had not received proper political education. After entering the factory, because the Party's ideological work was weak, they had not been given systematic class education, as well as education on hard work, plain living, and building the country through diligence and thrift. In particular, the factory's Party organization did not closely grasp the ideological remoulding work of those workers from exploiting class families. These people brought non-proletarian ideologies and styles, which had an extremely bad influence on some workers, especially young workers. Lan Xiurong changed her original character under this ideological erosion. At present, the Party organization of this factory has paid attention to learning from the lessons and is strengthening political and ideological education among employees.
　　Lan Xiurong's changes are a mirror for many workers who have been eroded by non-proletarian ideologies and styles, and also a mirror for comrades who do the Party's ideological work among employees.

### 女工蓝秀荣的变化

　　女工蓝秀荣的变化
　　本报记者  张健虹
    蓝秀荣是国营郑州第三棉纺织厂细纱车间的优秀女工。去年8月以前，她曾连续被评为先进生产者。可是到9月以后，她的生产成绩变坏了，她不仅没有赶上先进水平，而且连一般的计划也没有完成。
    蓝秀荣的生产情况为什么变得这样坏呢？
    原来，十九岁的蓝秀荣，不久前和厂里的“舞迷”胡桂兰交上了朋友。于是胡桂兰带她跑遍了郑州市各机关、企业的舞场，不分昼夜地在外边游逛。当她做夜班的时候，早上六点下班，顶多睡四、五个钟头，就到外边游逛去了。要是做白班，每天就回来得更晚了。就是这种过分的玩乐，经常的睡眠不足，使蓝秀荣失去了原有的工作朝气。
    蓝秀荣的变化，在群众中引起了许多议论。有人说：“蓝秀荣家里穷得什么也没有，吃的是窝窝头，有时还保不住一天三顿，读不起书，解放后才上了夜学，为什么很快就忘了本？！”还有人说：“蓝秀荣原来是不错，生产又好，生活也朴素，才入了团，为啥交到胡桂兰做朋友，就变成了这样儿？”和她同一个寝室的伙伴们也反映：“蓝秀荣，可是个有成色的女儿！能裁、能剪、能缝，挺聪明！从小就在家纳鞋底，赚些钱来补助家用，现在为啥要跟舞迷走这浮华道儿？”人们不大摸得清蓝秀荣变化的底细。其实，蓝秀荣的变化是不奇怪的。
    俗话说“学坏容易，学好难”，自从她和“舞迷”交上了朋友以后，她时刻在追求着奇装异服。春节前后不到一个月的时间，就电烫过两次头发，一连买了两三条围巾，有了长的，又添方的；花色不如意，再买一条。买一件上衣三十多元，缝一条西裤十几元，还说：这料子瘪脚。一个月八十元工资，常常是自个儿花了一大半，才给家里捎去一点生活费。8月里到文化班报了名，上了几天课，就自动休学了。
    女工蓝秀荣的情况，在这个厂里来说还不是个别的。据厂里最近的粗略统计，全厂五千多生产工人中，有70％以上是新工人。这些人的来路很广，成分也很复杂；除了来自工人、农民、城市贫民外，还有刚从地主、富农、商人、资本家、流氓、旧官吏等家庭里走出来的子女。他们在考入工厂以前，大多数没有受过适当的政治教育；进厂以后，又因为党的思想工作薄弱，没有向他们进行过系统的阶级教育，以及艰苦朴素、勤俭建国的教育。特别是对那些剥削者家庭出身的工人，厂里的党组织并没有抓紧对他们进行思想改造工作。这些人带来了非无产阶级思想作风，在部分工人、特别是年轻的工人中起了极不好的影响。蓝秀荣就在这种思想侵蚀下，改变了原来的本色。目前这个厂的党组织已经注意吸取教训，在职工中加强政治思想教育工作。
    蓝秀荣的变化，是许多受了非无产阶级思想作风侵蚀的工人们的一面镜子，也是我们在职工中做党的思想工作同志的一面镜子。
