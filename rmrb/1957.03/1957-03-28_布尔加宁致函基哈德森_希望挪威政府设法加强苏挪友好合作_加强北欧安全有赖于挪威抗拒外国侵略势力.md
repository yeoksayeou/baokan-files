Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 27th: TASS reported from Moscow on March 27th: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Bulganin, wrote a letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Gerhardsen on March 19th, hoping that the Norwegian government would find ways to strengthen friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and Norway. The letter stated that under the current situation, further strengthening Nordic security largely depends on whether the Norwegian government is determined to resist the pressure from foreign aggressive forces that attempt to create disputes between the Soviet Union and Norway and create tension in northern Soviet Union.

Bulganin said that the current international situation is still tense. Unprecedented arms expansion is still underway. Some countries are trying to recreate the atmosphere of the Cold War. The Soviet Union cannot remain indifferent to this attempt to threaten world peace. He pointed out that the Norwegian government has undertaken the promise not to provide bases for foreign armed forces. At the same time, for the first time in its history, it has participated in a military alliance aimed at a large neighboring country, and has had to allow foreign headquarters to be located within its borders, damaging its own independence; plans have been drawn up for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to use Norwegian merchant ships for military purposes. This means that preparations are actually being made to allow the armed forces of the North Atlantic bloc to use Norwegian territory to attack the Soviet Union at any time.

Bulganin said that considering the situation, the Soviet Union does not demand that the Norwegian government abolish the North Atlantic Alliance Treaty today or tomorrow. However, the interests of both the Soviet Union and Norway require that there be no ambiguity on the fundamental issues of Soviet-Norwegian relations.

Bulganin emphasized the danger that the implementation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's plan to deploy atomic weapons on the territories of its member states would pose to these countries, especially Norway. He said that the Soviet Union does not intend to invade anyone, but it is very clear that in order to counter aggressive actions against the Soviet Union, we cannot but take extremely strong measures in order to inflict fatal blows on aggressors, including bases close to our borders.

Bulganin continued, saying that the Soviet government always regards ensuring lasting peace in Northern Europe and strengthening friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the Nordic countries as one of the important tasks of the Soviet government. Bulganin said that there are no disputes between the Soviet Union and Norway that would cause conflicts of national interests between the two countries. If there are factors hindering the development of friendly relations between us, then these factors are external.

Bulganin said that the Soviet government sincerely hopes to establish friendly and fully trusting relations with Norway, and to establish relations as good as those between the Soviet Union and its northern neighbor, Finland.

Xinhua News Agency, March 27th, Oslo: A spokesman for the Norwegian Foreign Ministry said that the Norwegian government is "considering" the letter from Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin to Norwegian Prime Minister Gerhardsen. The letter pointed out the danger that Norwegian territory could be used as a missile and rocket base for the North Atlantic bloc. The spokesman also said that Norway will submit a reply "at the appropriate time."

　　布尔加宁致函基哈德森
　　希望挪威政府设法加强苏挪友好合作
　　加强北欧安全有赖于挪威抗拒外国侵略势力
    据新华社27日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科27日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁19日写信给挪威首相基哈德森，希望挪威政府设法加强苏挪两国之间的友好合作。信中说，在当前局势下要进一步加强北欧的安全，这在很大程度上取决于挪威政府是否有决心抗拒企图在苏联和挪威之间制造纠纷并且在苏联北部制造紧张局势的外国侵略势力的压力。
    布尔加宁说，目前的国际形势仍然是紧张的。空前规模的扩张军备仍然在进行。一些国家企图重新制造冷战的气氛。苏联对这种威胁世界和平的企图不能漠不关心。他指出，挪威政府承担着不向外国武装部队提供基地的诺言。同时，它有史以来第一次参加了矛头针对毗邻的大国的军事联盟，并且不得不让外国总部设在本国境内而损害自己的独立；北大西洋公约组织为军事目的利用挪威商船的计划已经制定好了。这就是说，实际上是准备随时让北大西洋集团的武装部队利用挪威的领土来进攻苏联。
    布尔加宁说，考虑到局势，苏联不要求挪威政府今天或是明天就废除北大西洋联盟公约。但是，苏挪两国的利益要求双方在苏挪关系的根本问题上没有任何模糊不清的地方。
    布尔加宁强调指出了实现北大西洋公约组织关于在它的成员国的领土上配置原子武器的计划将会给这些国家、特别是挪威造成的危险，他说，苏联不打算侵犯谁，但是，十分清楚，为了反击对苏联的侵略行动，我们就不能不采取极其强有力的措施，以便给予侵略者，其中包括对靠近我国边境的基地以致命的打击。
    布尔加宁接着说，苏联政府永远把保证北欧的持久和平、加强苏联同北欧国家的友好关系看做是苏联政府的重要任务之一。布尔加宁说，苏联同挪威之间不存在任何会使两国民族利益发生冲突的纠纷问题。如果说，有妨碍我们之间的友好关系发展的因素存在，那末这种因素也是外来的。
    布尔加宁说，苏联政府衷心地希望同挪威建立友谊和充分信任的关系，建立就像苏联同它的北邻芬兰那样良好的关系。
    据新华社27日讯　奥斯陆消息：挪威外交部的发言人说，挪威政府“正在考虑”苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁给挪威首相基哈德森的信。这封信指出，挪威的领土有被用作北大西洋集团的导弹和火箭基地的危险。这个发言人还说，挪威将在
  “适当的时候”提出答复。
