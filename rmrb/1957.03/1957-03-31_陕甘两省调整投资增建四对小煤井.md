Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, March 30th. The coal industry departments of Shaanxi and Gansu provinces recently adjusted a batch of capital construction funds. In addition to ensuring the normal construction of the eight pairs of mines being continued and rebuilt this year, they decided to build four new pairs of small inclined shafts that are "less investment and quick to produce results."

These new wells will be built in the Shizuishan mining area and the Shandan mining area in Gansu, and the Tongchuan mining area in Shaanxi. Their designed annual output is about 800,000 tons, and they can produce coal after more than a year of construction.

The cost of these adjusted for new coal wells, accounting for about 5% of the total basic construction investment of the two provinces this year. This was balanced out by discussing this year's engineering projects one by one at the recent meeting of the heads and construction directors of the two provincial mining bureaus. More than 2 million yuan has been adjusted from projects that can be built later and equipment that can be purchased later.

　  陕甘两省调整投资增建四对小煤井
    新华社西安30日电  陕西、甘肃两省煤炭工业部门最近调整出一批基本建设资金，除保证今年续建和改建的八对矿井正常施工以外，决定再新建四对“投资少、见效快”的小型斜井。
    这些新井将分别建在甘肃的石嘴山矿区、山丹矿区和陕西铜川矿区。它们的设计年产量约共八十多万吨，经过一年多建设过程便可出煤。
    这笔调整出来用于新建煤井的费用，约占两省今年基本建设投资的5％强。这都是在最近结束的两省矿务局长和筹建主任会议上，逐个讨论了今年工程项目而平衡出来的。从可以缓建的工程和可以缓购的设备项目中，就调整出了两百多万元。
