    Continue to Strengthen Learning and Thoroughly Transform Thinking
    Zhang Bohua Says This is a Regular Task for the CPPCC in the Future
    I had the opportunity to come to Beijing to listen to and discuss Chairman Mao’s report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, Premier Zhou’s report on his visit to eleven Asian and European countries, Vice Premier Li Fuchun’s report on several issues concerning the proposals for our country’s Second Five-Year Plan, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong’s report on the work of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. This was a profound learning and education in Marxist-Leninist theory and policies for me. I express my heartfelt support and am willing to work hard with practical actions and full confidence in the future to implement and realize them.
    Now, I would like to share some of my personal experiences regarding the work of the Baoji Municipal CPPCC in organizing and leading people from all walks of life, industrialists and businessmen, and some old intellectuals in transforming their thinking through continuous learning and practice.
    I. Under the new situation in which our country’s socialist transformation has achieved a decisive victory, the ideological understanding of people from all walks of life, industrialists and businessmen, and old intellectuals has also undergone great changes. Especially after Premier Zhou’s report on the issue of intellectuals and the principles of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" were put forward, they were greatly encouraged and inspired, and they generally demanded progress and learning. Therefore, since 1956, the Baoji Municipal CPPCC has first expanded the scope of contact and the organization of the committee, especially improving and expanding the learning organization, setting up full-time cadres, increasing the number of learning instructors (from thirty-six people to one hundred and twenty-five people), and strengthening the collective and specific leadership work of the learning committee. The number of students has expanded from more than one hundred to one thousand six hundred and sixty-four, and various organizational forms such as study classes, spare-time political schools, political lectures, and lectures for families of industrialists and businessmen have been adopted to carry out learning separately according to the different situations of the students. At the same time, different learning content and learning methods were prescribed for different objects. Thanks to the measures taken to strengthen leadership, and the implementation of the Party's policy of unity and education towards non-Party members, and the voluntary learning policy, significant achievements and certain effects have been achieved through planned and systematic learning in the past year. It is manifested in: (1) Some industrialists and businessmen originally did not believe in the truth that labor creates everything, thinking that whoever controls political power is the truth, and that they started their businesses through diligence and thrift and did not exploit. After learning, they more clearly recognized the exploiting nature of the bourgeoisie and corrected the old ideas and styles in production and management to varying degrees. For example, some people said: "My family has been bourgeois for three generations. In the past, I thought it was right to make profits from doing business. Now I know that exploiting workers and enjoying personal enjoyment is a shameful act." Another example is an industrialist and businessman who was unwilling to work as a salesperson after joint operation, was passive in his work, and failed to complete his tasks. After learning, he not only theoretically understood the laws of social development and the glorious future of individuals, but also enthusiastically treated his work and found ways to find the knack. As a result, he overfulfilled his tasks every month and was later rated as an advanced industrial and commercial worker of Grade A.
      (2) After learning, the sense of ownership and patriotism of social figures have been significantly improved. For example, since the second half of 1956, members and contacts of this committee have submitted forty-four written constructive suggestions and opinions, which have played a positive role in improving the government's work and correcting shortcomings. Another example is an old intellectual who was only engaged in technology and originally had the idea of retiring. After contact and learning, he not only recognized his purely technical views and wrong ideas of being divorced from politics, but also took the initiative to actively ask to participate in work and join a democratic party. Later, he also performed well in his work. (3) In order to cooperate with learning, more than 600 people from all walks of life were organized to visit factories, agricultural cooperatives, Yellow River management exhibitions, and the Qinling Tunnel project of the Baocheng Railway in 1956. They were also organized to inspect private reform, inspect grass-roots election work, and other observations and practices of social life, so that they received practical education in vivid facts, improved their ideological awareness, and inspired patriotism and enthusiasm for socialism.
    II. Although the ideological understanding of people from all walks of life has made great progress through learning and practice, there is still a long way to go to meet the requirements of our constantly developing construction cause, and there are still many ideological problems. For example, some of us sometimes look at problems subjectively and one-sidedly from the perspective of personal interests, and our sense of responsibility for work is not strong enough; some people do not have enough sense of ownership, have a sense of inferiority, pass over work, and are afraid of taking responsibility; and some people, once they have achieved some success, become arrogant and complacent, and are concerned about status and treatment, etc. These are all stumbling blocks on our road to progress. Therefore, continuing to strengthen learning and thoroughly transform thinking has become a regular, arduous, and glorious political task for the CPPCC in the future. To do this work well, according to our experience, it is necessary to:
    First of all, it is necessary to further strengthen the Party's organizational leadership over the learning of people from all walks of life, and at the same time, it is necessary to closely cooperate with democratic parties and people's organizations, and absorb their leaders and cadres to participate in the learning committee and serve as teachers and instructors, and strengthen organizational education to their members and the masses they contact according to the learning committee's plan through the organizations of democratic parties and people's organizations. For example, Social Persons Groups 1 and 2 are divided into groups according to the objects contacted by the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang and the China Democratic League, and cadres are drawn from the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang and the China Democratic League to specifically guide the learning. The Industrial and Commercial Class Committee and the Family Learning Committee absorb relevant units such as the China National Democratic Construction Association, the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce to participate in the leadership work. This not only solves the problem of insufficient cadre strength of the CPPCC, but also adapts to the characteristics of social figures, industrialists and businessmen and their families, which not only implements the education plan, but also widely carries out social liaison work, and also strengthens the connection between the CPPCC and various democratic parties and people's organizations, and enriches the work content of democratic parties and people's organizations, thereby consolidating and expanding the people's democratic united front.
    Secondly, in learning, it is necessary to better implement the principle of conscious voluntarism, because only when students understand the importance of learning ideologically can they consciously work hard to learn and transform their thinking. In the groups that have implemented this principle in learning, the students' learning enthusiasm is high, and they show active initiative in learning. On the contrary, in individual groups in the industrial and commercial sector, due to the rigid measures of assigning speeches and checking notes, as well as the long learning time and the large number of documents arranged each time, the discussion is not enthusiastic enough, and the learning effect is not very good. Therefore, in learning, it is necessary to strengthen guidance, earnestly enlighten, eliminate concerns, and be able to make students thoroughly open up, freely argue, and achieve the purpose of distinguishing right from wrong and recognizing the truth on the basis of conscious voluntarism in a relaxed and pleasant way. However, free debate must be based on seeking truth from facts and persuading people with reason. It will not be effective to put on big hats or adopt a rude attitude.
      Third, in learning, it is necessary to combine understanding and solving the actual problems of students to carry out ideological education, in order to achieve the effect of linking theory with practice, transforming thinking, and strengthening unity. On the one hand, it is necessary to use various special working groups, learning organizations, and meetings under the leadership of the CPPCC to carry out contact and understanding. More importantly, it is necessary to go deep into the masses, strengthen the individual contact and visits and talks work at ordinary times, and understand the actual problems of students' opinions and requirements in learning, work, and life at any time, conduct specific analysis, study and solve them, and carry out ideological education work in combination with the solution of practical problems. Solving ideological problems is a link that cannot be ignored in doing a good job in learning. Fourth, in the teaching work, it is necessary to carry forward democracy and follow the mass line. Each unit's lecture notes must be convened in advance for the persons in charge of the learning committee, the director of the office, and the teachers to conduct research, and repeatedly revised in combination with the students' opinions, so that the content of the lecture notes can be more substantial, specific, and practical, and welcomed by the students. At the same time, after the lecture, study points are printed and distributed, which is of great help to the leadership of instructors and group leaders, and to the systematic understanding of the spirit of the documents by people with low culture and old age who cannot take notes. When necessary, a large-scale symposium is organized for each unit to achieve a wider range of free debate and deepen the understanding of theoretical issues, which is also a necessary method to do a good job in learning.

    继续加强学习　彻底改造思想
    张伯华说，这是政协今后的一项经常任务
    我有机会来京听取和讨论毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的报告、周总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告、李富春副总理关于我国第二个五年计划建议的若干问题的报告及陈叔通副主席关于中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常委会工作报告，这对我是一次深刻的对于马列主义理论政策的学习和教育，我表示衷心拥护，并愿在今后工作中，以实际行动、满怀信心的为其贯彻和实现而努力。
    现在我想就宝鸡市政协在组织领导各界人士、工商业者及部分旧知识分子从不断学习与实践中改造思想工作方面谈一些个人的体会。
    一、在我国社会主义改造事业取得决定性胜利的新形势下，各界人士、工商业者、旧知识分子的思想认识，也起了很大的变化，特别在周总理关于知识分子问题的报告，及“百花齐放、百家争鸣”等方针提出以后，他们都受到极大的鼓舞和感召，普遍要求进步，要求学习。为此，宝鸡市政协从五六年以来，首先扩大了联系范围和委员会组织，特别是健全与扩大了学习组织，设置了专职干部，增加了学习辅导员（由三六人—一二五人）加强了学委会的集体与具体领导工作，学员人数由原来一百多人，扩大到一六六四人，并根据学员各种不同情况，采取讲习班、业余政治学校、政治讲座及工商界家属讲座等组织形式，分别开展学习。同时按不同对象规定了不同的学习内容和学习方法。由于采取了措施加强了领导，并贯彻了党对党外人士团结教育的政策，和自觉自愿的学习方针，通过有计划有系统的学习，一年来取得了显著成绩和一定的效果。表现在：（一）工商业者有些人原来不相信劳动创造一切的真理，以为谁掌握了政权就是真理，认为自己是勤俭起家、没有剥削，经过学习较明确的认识了资产阶级的剥削本质不同程度的改正了生产经营中的旧思想旧作风。如有的人说：“我家三辈人都是资产阶级，过去认为做生意取利是应该的，现在才知道剥削工人、为个人享受是可耻的行为。”又如一位工商业者，合营后不愿作营业员，工作消极，完不成任务，学习后不但从理论上认识了社会发展规律和个人光荣前途，而且热情对待工作想办法找窍门，结果每月超额完成任务，后被评为甲等工商业先进工作者。
      （二）社会人士学习后，主人翁感和爱国主义思想显著提高，如本会委员及联系人士1956年下半年来用书面提出建设性建议和意见四四件，这对政府改进工作纠正缺点方面起了积极作用。又如一位单搞技术原有隐退思想的旧知识分子，经联系学习后不但认识了他的单纯技术观点及脱离政治的错误思想，而且主动积极要求参加工作，加入民主党派，后来在工作中表现也很好。（三）为配合学习在1956年
  内先后组织各界人士六百多人参观了工厂、农业社、治黄展览及宝成铁路秦岭隧道工程，并组织视察私改、巡视基层选举工作等社会生活的观察和实践，使他们在生动的事实中受到了实际教育，提高了思想觉悟，启发了爱国热情和对社会主义的积极性。
    二、虽然经过学习和实践各界人士的思想认识有了很大进步，但这与我们不断发展的建设事业的要求还有很大距离的，思想上的问题还是不少的。如我们有些人有时看问题主观片面从个人利益出发，工作责任心不够强；有的人主人翁思想还不够，有自卑感，对工作得过且过，怕负责任；还有的人，一旦取得了些成绩，就骄傲自满，计较地位待遇等等资产阶级个人主义思想作风。这都是我们前进道路上的绊脚石。因此继续加强学习，彻底改造思想，就成了政协今后一项经常的艰巨的也是光荣的政治任务。要作好这项工作，根据我们的体会，必须：
    首先，要进一步加强党对各界人士学习的组织领导，同时要与民主党派、人民团体密切配合，吸收他们的负责人、干部参加学委、担任教员辅导员等实际学习领导工作，并通过民主党派、人民团体的组织向其成员及所联系的群众按学委计划加强组织教育。如社会人士一二组是按民革民盟组织所联系的对象划分小组，由民革民盟抽出干部具体辅导学习。工商业者讲习班委会及家属学委会吸收民建、青年团、妇联、工商联等有关单位参加领导工作，这样既解决了政协干部力量不足问题，又适应了社会人士、工商业者及其家属的特点，既贯彻了教育计划，又广泛的开展了社会联系工作，同时也加强了政协和各民主党派人民团体的联系，且丰富了民主党派、人民团体的工作内容，从而更加巩固和扩大了人民民主统一战线。
    其次，在学习中要更好的贯彻自觉自愿的方针，因为只有使学员从思想上懂得学习的重要性以后，才能自觉的努力学习，改造思想。凡是在学习中贯彻了这个方针的小组，学员的学习情绪就高，对学习表现积极主动。相反的如工商界个别小组由于硬性采取指定发言、检查笔记的办法，以及每次学习时间长、布置文件又多等原因，讨论不够热烈，学习效果也不很好。因此在学习中必须加强辅导，认真启发，消除顾虑，做到能够使学员在自觉自愿的基础上，轻松愉快的彻底敞开，自由争辩，才能达到分清是非、认识真理的目的。但自由争辩，必须实事求是，以理服人，扣大帽子或采取粗暴态度都是不会收到效果的。
      第三，在学习中要结合了解与解决学员的实际问题，进行思想教育，才能收到理论联系实际、改造思想、加强团结的效果。这一方面要利用政协领导下的各种专门工作组、学习组织及会议等形式进行联系了解，更重要的是要深入群众，加强平时个别联系和访问谈心工作，随时了解学员在学习、工作及生活各方面的意见要求等实际问题，进行具体分析，研究解决，结合实际问题的解决，进行思想教育工作，解决思想问题，这是搞好学习不可忽视的环节。第四，在教课工作中要发扬民主，走群众路线，每单元讲稿必须事先召集学委负责人、办公室主任及教员等进行研究，并结合学员意见反复修正，这样讲稿内容才能更充实具体切合实际，受到学员欢迎，同时讲课后印发学习要点，对帮助辅导员、小组长的领导及文化低、年纪大记不上笔记的人，有重点有系统的领会文件精神也有很大的作用，必要时每单元组织一次大型座谈，达到更广泛的开展自由争辩和加深对理论问题的理解，也是搞好学习的必要方法。（附图片）
