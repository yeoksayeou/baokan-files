　　The Orphan's Paradise
　　Dé Xiān
    Walking past the gate of the Fuzhou Infant and Child Care院, I often see a group of children playing on the grass in the院's garden. Some are playing games; some are singing happily; some are dancing to their hearts' content. There are more than 270 children living here, the youngest only a few days old, the oldest not yet seven years old. Most of them are orphans who have lost their parents.

    One day, I visited this care院. In the children's dormitories, neat bedding was placed on small beds painted green, and each bed also had a white knitted gauze net. When I stepped into the playroom with wooden horses, rocking boats and other toys, the children all ran over to surround me, some pulling on my clothes, some embracing me affectionately. The children also performed the turnip-pulling dance, symbolizing unity, for me.

    院长陈良瑛 said to me: The boy who was pulling on my clothes is named Li Jinhua, and he is already five years old this year. He was admitted to the院 in 1955. On January 20th of that year, when US-made Chiang Kai-shek military planes bombed the residential area of Taikou, his father was blown to bits and his mother was burned alive in the fire! The next day, he was sent here by his uncle. Li Jinhua lost his parents, but in the院 he received the love of the aunties. For the past two or three years, he, like many orphans, has gradually grown up under the hard work of the aunties.

    The院 gives the children nutritious food every day, such as milk, pig liver, meat sauce, vegetable juice, and fruit. Now, the children are all growing up very plump. The orphan Jing Jiang is a thirteen-month-old child. When he was brought into the院 last spring, he was sick and as thin as a monkey, weighing less than six pounds. In order to save this little life, the院 often gave him cod liver oil, pig liver, and various vitamin pills. The院's doctors often gave him tonic injections. Now, Jing Jiang has grown into a lovable fat baby.

    In order to ensure that every child grows up healthy, the院's childcare workers not only ensure that the children eat well, play well, and sleep well, but also try to minimize the children's suffering from diseases. In order to prepare for blood transfusions for the children when necessary, more than fifty young childcare workers volunteered to participate in blood type testing. Recently, an orphan named Li Hui contracted diphtheria, and doctors diagnosed that he needed a blood transfusion to save him. The childcare worker Lin Lanxin was worried that Li Hui couldn't speak and didn't want to eat, and couldn't even sleep at night. On the first day Li Hui was in the hospital, she went to the hospital to take care of him day and night, and asked the doctor to draw blood from her body to transfuse to Li Hui. Li Hui's condition gradually improved, and Lin Lanxin told everyone she met: Li Hui is getting better, and his little life has been saved.

    A childcare worker, Lin Guan, who worked in the Fuzhou Relief院 Nursery fifteen years ago, told me: Before liberation, this so-called charitable organization's nursery was simply a shocking "children's graveyard". Most of the infants who entered the院 couldn't survive for more than a few days, dying from cold, starvation, or disease, and some were even bitten to death by rats. The workers in the院 had to drag out four or five dead babies every day. In the winter of 1945, more than twenty infants in the院 were successively frozen to death and starved to death, and only one live child was left. According to written records from relevant departments, the mortality rate of infants at that time was over 94%.

    In January 1951, when the People's Government took over the nursery, all eighty-one infants in the院 were skin and bones, and none of them were free of disease, some even suffering from two or three diseases. In order to save these little lives, the leaders of the care院 put forward the slogan "Rescue the Infants", and soon the children were restored to health. Over the past few years, under the care of the Party and the government for orphans and the hard work of the childcare workers, the "children's graveyard" has become an orphan's paradise.

　　孤儿的乐园
　　德籼
    走过福州市婴幼教养院门前，经常会看到一群孩子在院内花园里的草地上玩耍。有的在作游戏；有的在欢乐地歌唱；有的在尽情地舞蹈。生活在这里的孩子，共有二百七十多个，小的刚出生几天，大的还不到七周岁。他们多数是失去了父母的孤儿。
    一天，我参观了这个教养院。在孩子们的宿舍里，一只只漆着绿色油漆的小床上，放着整洁的被褥，每只小床上还挂着一顶白色的罗纹纱帐。当我跨进放有木马、摇船等玩具的游戏室时，孩子们都跑来把我围住，有的拉着我的衣襟，有的亲热地抱住我。孩子们还表演了象征团结的拔萝卜舞给我看。
    院长陈良瑛对我说：拉着我的衣襟的男孩子名叫李锦华，今年已经五岁了。他是1955年入院的。那年1月20日，美制蒋军飞机轰炸台口居民区时，他的父亲被炸得血肉模糊，母亲在烈火中被活活烧死！第二天，他就被舅父送到这里来。李锦华失去了父母，在院里获得了阿姨们的爱护。两三年来，他和许多孤儿一样，在阿姨们辛苦的抚养下逐渐长大了。
    院里每天给孩子吃牛奶、猪肝、肉酱、菜汁、水果等富有营养的食物。现在，孩子们个个长得很胖。孤儿经姜是一个十三个月的孩子，去年春天抱进院时，正在患病，瘦得像只猴子，体重还不到六斤。院里为了救活这个小生命，经常给他吃鱼肝油、猪肝和各种维他命丸。院里的医生，时常给他打补药针。现在，经姜已经长成一个逗人喜爱的胖娃娃了。
    院里的保育员为了让每个孩子都健壮地成长起来，不仅做到让孩子们吃好、玩好、睡好，还尽量争取让孩子们少受疾病的痛苦。为了准备必要时为孩子们输血，五十多个年轻的保育员都自愿参加了血型检验。最近，一个叫利惠的孤儿患了白喉，经医生诊断需要输血才能救活他。保育员林兰馨听到利惠不会叫，不想吃，愁得晚上连觉也睡不着。在利惠住医院的第一天，她就到医院去日夜看管他，并请求医生从她身上抽血输给利惠。利惠的病逐渐好转了，林兰馨逢人就说：利惠病好了，小生命保住了。
    一位十五年前曾在福州救济院育婴所工作过的保育员林关告诉我：解放前，这个所谓慈善机关的育婴所简直是一个骇人听闻的“死儿窟”。婴孩进所大都活不了几天，不是冻死、饿死，就是病死，有的还给老鼠咬死了。所里的工友每天总要拖出四、五个死婴。1945年冬天，所里有二十多个婴孩，陆续被冻死、饿死，最后只剩下一个活孩子。据有关部门的文字记载，当时婴孩的死亡率达94％以上。
    1951年1月，人民政府接办育婴所的时候，全所八十一个婴孩都瘦得皮包骨头，没有一个没有病，有的甚至害着两、三种病。教养院的领导上为了救活这些小生命，提出了“抢救婴孩”的口号，不久就使孩子恢复健康了。几年来，在党和政府对孤儿的关怀和保育员的努力工作下，“死儿窟”变成了孤儿的乐园。
