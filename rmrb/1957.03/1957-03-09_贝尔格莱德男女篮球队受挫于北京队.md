    Belgrade Men's and Women's Basketball Teams Suffer Defeat Against Beijing Teams

    (Our dispatch) Yesterday evening, the Yugoslav Belgrade City men's and women's basketball teams (formerly known as the Yugoslav National Men's and Women's Basketball Teams) held two friendly matches against the Beijing City men's and women's basketball teams at the Beijing Gymnasium. The Beijing men's and women's teams defeated the visiting teams with scores of 63-51 and 71-55, respectively.

    At the beginning of the men's match, the visiting team, targeting the Beijing team's fast speed and good penetration under the basket, adopted a tight zone defense and the tactic of all players retreating as quickly as possible, effectively preventing the Beijing team's offense. In the second half, the Beijing team substituted Yang Boyong, Wang Lifa, Zhang Xishan, and others, who are famous for their fast breaks, and adopted a tactic of fierce attacks and aggressive ball-stealing. The visiting team still relied on the center Miletić, who is 1.95 meters tall, to score under the basket, and coordinated with the guard Ložić's accurate mid-range shots. The competition between the two sides was very intense. In the end, the Beijing team won with a twelve-point lead.

    The lineup of the Beijing women's team was basically the main players of the mixed team. As soon as they took the court, they played fast and aggressively, with accurate mid-range shots, making almost nine out of ten shots, and therefore took the lead all the way. At the end of the third quarter, they took a lead of 57-34. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, the visiting team actively counterattacked, with center Radulović's hook shots under the basket coming easily. The visiting team also successfully made several sneak attacks, scoring a total of twenty-one points. However, due to too many points lost in the first three quarters, they finally suffered a defeat against the Beijing team with a score of 71-55.

    贝尔格莱德男女篮球队受挫于北京队
    本报讯　昨日晚上，南斯拉夫贝尔格莱德市男女篮球队（原称南斯拉夫国家男女篮球队）在北京体育馆内，对北京市男女篮球队举行了两场友谊比赛。北京男女队分别以六十三比五十一和七十一比五十五战胜了客队。
    男队比赛一开始，客队针对北京队速度快，篮下切入好的特点，采用紧缩的区域联防和全体队员尽快退守的战术，有效地阻止了北京队的进攻。到下半时，北京队换上了以快速突破著名的杨伯镛、王利发、张锡山等，采用猛冲猛打，紧逼抢球的战术，客队仍是利用身高一公尺九十五公分的中锋米莱提奇篮下得分，并配合后卫洛济的准确的中距离投篮，双方竞争十分激烈。最后，北京队以十二分之先取得了胜利。
    北京女子队上场的阵容基本上是混合队的主力队员，他们一上场便打得快速、积极，中距离投篮准确，几乎十投九中，因此一路领先。在第三节结束时，以五十七比三十四占先。第四节开始，客队积极反攻，中锋拉杜洛维奇篮下勾手投篮，打来得心应手。客队还成功地作了几次偷袭，总共投进了二十一分。但终因前三节失分太多，最后以七十一比五十五受挫于北京队。
