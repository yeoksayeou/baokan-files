This committee has the support of many British parliamentarians, scientists, the Quaker Peace Committee, constituency Labor Party organizations, and those participating in the cooperative movement.
    The committee issued a statement saying that its current goal is to support public pressure on Parliament to "persuade the government to cancel the planned series of hydrogen bomb tests, or at least postpone these tests for a certain period, during which negotiations can be conducted with other countries."
    Xinhua News Agency, March 12th, Tokyo dispatch: The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs has written to the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, hoping that the three countries will immediately begin negotiations on concluding an agreement banning atomic and hydrogen bomb tests and that all countries will suspend such tests during the negotiations.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly unanimously passed a resolution on March 11 protesting Britain's hydrogen bomb tests on Christmas Island. (Attached image)

    据新华社12日讯  英国“废除核子武器全国委员会”11日在伦敦宣布成立。这个委员会得到英国许多议员、科学家、基督教公谊会的和平委员会、各选区的工党组织和参加合作运动的人的支持。
    委员会发表声明说，这个委员会当前的目标是支持公众对议会行使压力，以“说服政府取消预定要举行的一系列氢弹试验，或者至少把这些试验推延一定时期，在这段时期内可以同其他国家进行谈判”。
    据新华社12日讯  东京消息：日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会写信给美国、英国、苏联三国政府首脑，希望英美苏三国立刻开始关于缔结禁止试验原子弹和氢弹协定的谈判并且希望在谈判进行期间，各国就都停止这种试验。同时，反对英国在圣诞岛举行氢弹试验的运动，在日本各地继续开展。东京都议会3月11日一致通过一项决议，抗议英国在圣诞岛作氢弹试验。（附图片）
