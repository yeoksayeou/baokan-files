I was invited to participate in the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and I feel infinitely honored and excited. Over the past ten days, listening to the speeches of Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Chen Yun, and Vice Premier Li Fuchun has been very enlightening for me. In Premier Zhou's report, he mentioned that the US government, in order to turn China's sacred territory of Taiwan into a territory like Honolulu, is instigating a group of elements who tout so-called free China to carry out activities to overthrow the Taiwan authorities. Now I would like to express my views on this issue:

What do I think are the elements of free China? They are probably those who oppose both the Chinese Communist Party and the Chiang Kai-shek Group, calling themselves "free" and "democratic" elements. Before liberation, there were indeed many such elements on the Chinese mainland. But in recent years, these elements on the mainland have undergone fundamental changes. This change was widely triggered around the time the Chinese People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River in early 1949. Because at that time, there were two paths placed before them: either to fail to Taiwan with the Chiang Kai-shek Group, or to stay with the Chinese Communist Party. There was no third way. The vast majority of them stayed, and a very small number went to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek. This was the final division of those so-called "free" and "democratic" elements who opposed both the Chinese Communist Party and the Chiang Kai-shek Group at the historical crossroads. Of course, there is also a small number who insist on their so-called "middle-of-the-road" position, that is, a small handful of people who are now living under the eaves in the United States or elsewhere, and their number is even smaller.

In recent years, these "free" and "democratic" elements who have stayed on the mainland have gained a preliminary understanding of the Chinese revolution and the Chinese Communist Party through their own personal experiences. Through the study of Marxism-Leninism, they slowly came to realize that so-called "freedom" and "democracy" have class character. For example, is American "freedom" and "democracy" available to everyone? On the surface, it is, but only on the surface. Let's take the so-called "Four Freedoms" that we often hear in the United States - freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, and freedom from want - they are indeed high-sounding. But peeling back these "Four Freedoms," we see that the nation's news agencies, newspapers, radio stations, and publishing industries are all controlled by monopoly capitalists. So, whose freedom is the so-called freedom of speech and publication? Recently, even journalists who want to come to China to cover the news cannot get approval from the US State Department. Where is the freedom there? As for freedom of religion, it is true that no one in the United States interferes with anyone's religious beliefs. But there is no freedom of political belief in the United States. We often hear that the leaders of the American Communist Party and other progressive people have been subjected to various persecutions by the American government. That is just part of the "masterpiece" of the US Congressional "Un-American Activities Investigating Committee." There are also millions of people who are routinely tracked, monitored, threatened, and enticed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation because of their ideas, which is not something that ordinary people can often know. I remember in 1945, when I was taking a course on American Foreign Policy at Columbia University, our professor defined the basic task of American foreign policy. He said that the basic task of American foreign policy is to protect American commercial interests overseas. An American classmate next to me stood up and asked, "Can your statement be understood as protecting American capitalists from engaging in foreign plunder?" The professor said, "Yes, that's absolutely right, but my dear friend, if you say that, you can forget about getting a diploma from this school." This is American freedom of religion. Although this was more than ten years ago, the political life in the United States has not changed much in the past ten years. If anything, it has regressed, not progressed. As for the so-called "freedom from want", it is even more obvious that only monopoly capitalists have this freedom. They not only have this freedom in the country, but also expand this "freedom" to Africa, the Middle East, South America, and Asia, engaging in insatiable plunder.

The United States also has elections, Congress every two years, and the President every four years, but the US Congress is truly a monolithic Congress of monopoly bourgeoisie. Whether in Britain, France, Italy, or Japan, there is no such monolithic Congress, because in the Congresses of Britain, France, Italy, and Japan, there are always some representatives of the working people, more or less. In the US monopoly bourgeoisie Congress, even the number of people representing the petty bourgeoisie is very small, and there are even fewer representing the working people. So it is 100% the dictatorship of the monopoly bourgeoisie, and everything is to ensure that the monopoly bourgeoisie obtains the maximum profit. This is the essence of American freedom and democracy. We don't want this kind of freedom and democracy. What we want is socialist democracy and freedom based on public ownership of the means of production. This is the real democracy and freedom enjoyed by the broad masses of the people. The people's democratic system in our country now belongs to this type.

People's democracy is the opposite of bourgeois democracy. Bourgeois democracy is the democracy of the few and the dictatorship of the few over the majority, while people's democracy is the democracy of the majority and the dictatorship of the majority over the few. That is, the people's dictatorship over imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and other counter-revolutionary elements. Its purpose is to establish a great socialist cause. Because this cause is the common cause of the people, it must rely on the active participation of the broad masses of the people and fight against all resistance. This determines the broad representation and the truthfulness of the content of people's democracy. The organization and work of the National and local People's Political Consultative Conferences and the people's congresses at all levels fully reflect this spirit. The self-criticism and criticism from the bottom up that is often carried out in state organs, enterprises, schools, and people's organizations also reflects this spirit. Recently, the CPC Central Committee's policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" for all democratic parties, and the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" in the literary and artistic circles and academic circles, have enriched our country's democratic life. Secondly, because socialist construction must be carried out in an organized and led manner, people's democracy is also organized and led. This is democratic centralism. The leading role in our country's people's democratic system is the working class and its vanguard—the Chinese Communist Party. Because the Chinese Communist Party is selfless, armed with Marxism-Leninism, and has rich revolutionary experience, it can correctly grasp the laws of the development of things, closely connect with the masses of the people, and unite the 600 million people of the country like a giant, selflessly laboring and fighting for the great socialist transformation and construction. In just a few years, it has achieved amazing achievements in politics, economy, culture, diplomacy, and national defense.

For several years, I have been working in the Shanghai Foreign Trade System, and I have personally experienced the rapid progress of the motherland's socialist cause. Its manifestation in the development of foreign trade is also unprecedentedly great. Taking the development of Shanghai's industrial product exports as an example, in 1956, the Shanghai branch of the China National Sundries Export Corporation alone operated the export of industrial products, with a total foreign exchange value equivalent to about one million tons of steel. The part exported to the capitalist market in 1956 was about twelve times the actual export performance in 1954. If we take the exports of the entire port of Shanghai, as far as I know, the export of industrial products accounts for 50% of Shanghai's total exports. These industrial products are sold to fifty-three countries and regions, spanning the five continents of the world. What does this situation reflect? First, it shows that due to the rapid upsurge of our national economy, the response to foreign trade has also been rapid expansion and development. Second, it shows that the proportion of industrial production in the national economy is constantly increasing, reflecting a major change in our country's export commodities. That is, our traditional exports, which were mainly agricultural and sideline products, have now gradually become the main commodities for export. But taking cotton cloth as an example, although the quantity exported last year was about eight times the highest historical export year, it only accounted for about 5% of the total domestic sales. It can be seen that the potential for exporting industrial products is still very large. Could these things have been dreamed of during the reactionary rule of imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism? Isn't this one of the signs of the rapid progress of socialist construction under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao in our great motherland? Therefore, although the US government has imposed a so-called blockade and embargo on our country since 1950, it cannot stop the development of our foreign trade in the slightest, just as its refusal to recognize the existence of the People's Republic of China and its 600 million people cannot affect our country's progress and growth along the socialist road, nor can it affect our country's status in international affairs, which is getting higher and higher day by day.

Today, it is very glorious to be a Chinese person. Premier Zhou's recent visit to eleven countries and the high reputation he received further illustrates this point. The Chinese "free" and "democratic" elements who stayed on the mainland have seen the greatness of the achievements of the motherland's socialist cause everywhere, and therefore they are more and more convinced that the path they have chosen to follow the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people is completely correct and bright. They are increasingly firm in their socialist beliefs and are willing to transform themselves gradually into or are becoming socialist activists through learning, work, and social life.

If the Chinese "free" and "democratic" elements who have now taken refuge in the United States still fantasize about finding your friends on the Chinese mainland to echo you, then you are truly daydreaming. You talk about opposing Chiang Kai-shek, but the US imperialist line you are taking is the same as that of the Chiang Group. The Chiang Kai-shek Group is anti-people and anti-motherland, and you are also anti-people and anti-motherland. Now, just as more and more people in the Chiang Kai-shek Group feel that this route is impassable and are planning to turn back, you are raising the banner of "destroying the party to save the country" and trying to come to Taiwan to replace Chiang Kai-shek. Forget it, what "destroying the party to save the country"? You are trying to destroy the country and destroy yourselves. But the people's China is getting stronger and stronger day by day, just like the rising sun, and no force in the world can stop it. Taiwan is our country's territory. No matter who wants to sell themselves to American imperialism there and maintain a state of separation from the motherland, the people will not allow it. Today, the only path you should take is to break free from the cage of American imperialism, return to the embrace of the motherland, and participate together in the great socialist construction. The door of the motherland is open, waiting for everyone who is willing to turn back. (Attached picture)

　　只有挣脱帝国主义的牢笼才有出路
　　黄启汉忠告台湾的所谓“自由”“民主”分子
    我被邀参加全国人民政治协商会议，感到无限的光荣和兴奋。这十多天来，听了毛主席、周总理、陈云副总理、李富春副总理的讲话，都给我很大的启发。在周总理报告中，提到美国政府为了要把中国的神圣领土台湾变成像檀香山一样的属地，正在策动一批标榜所谓自由中国的分子，进行推翻台湾当局的活动。现在我想就这个问题，发表我的一点看法：
    我想什么是自由中国的分子呢？大概是那些既反对中国共产党又反对蒋介石集团，自称“自由”“民主”的分子。解放前，在中国大陆上，的确有不少这类分子。但这几年来，大陆上的这类分子已经起了根本的变化。这种变化是在1949年初中国人民解放军渡江前后就广泛引起的。因为当时摆在他们面前有两条道路，要就是跟蒋介石集团失败到台湾去，要就是跟中国共产党留下来，中间没有第三条道路。他们绝大多数留下来了，极少数跟蒋介石到台湾去，这就是那些既反对中国共产党又反对蒋介石集团的所谓“自由”“民主”分子在历史的十字路口前面的最后分化。当然，另外还有一小部分坚持自己的所谓“中间路线”立场的，那就是现在美国或其他地方寄人篱下的一小撮人，为数更寥寥无几了。
    留在大陆上的这批“自由”“民主”分子，几年来，他们通过自己亲身的体会，对中国革命和中国共产党有了初步了解。他们通过马克思列宁主义的学习，慢慢地知道所谓“自由”“民主”是有阶级性的。譬如说：美国的“自由”“民主”，是人人都有份的吗？表面上是的，但只是表面上而已。就以我们在美国常听到的所谓
  “四大自由”来说吧——言论自由，出版自由，信仰自由，取的自由——的确冠冕堂皇。但揭开这“四大自由”来看，全国的通讯社、报纸、广播电台、出版业，都掌握在垄断资本家的手里，请问所谓言论出版的自由，究竟是归谁所有的自由？最近连新闻记者想到我们中国来采访新闻，也得不到美国国务院的批准，自由又在那里？至于信仰自由，在美国没有谁干涉谁信仰什么宗教，这是事实。但政治上的信仰在美国就没有自由了，我们常听到美国共产党的领袖和其他进步人士遭到美国政府的种种迫害，那不过是美国国会的“非美活动调查委员会”的一部分“杰作”，还有千万人平日因为思想问题被联邦调查局派人跟踪监视、威胁利诱的，那就不是一般人经常所能知道了。记得1945年我在哥伦比亚大学上美国外交政策一课的时候，我们那位教授对美国外交政策的基本任务，下了一条定义，他说美国外交政策的基本任务就是保护美国在海外的商业利益。我座旁的一位美国同学起来问：“你这样说法是不是可以理解为保护美国资本家对外进行掠夺？”教授说：“是的，一点也不错，但是我亲爱的朋友，要是你这样说的话，你就休想在这个学校拿到文凭。”这就是美国的信仰自由。这虽然是十多年前的话，但十年来美国的政治生活，没有多大变化，有的是倒退，不是进步。至于所谓“取的自由”，那就更为明显，只有垄断资本家才有这种自由，他们不仅在国内有这种自由，还在扩大这种“自由”到非洲、中近东、南美洲和亚洲来。进行贪得无厌的掠夺。
    美国也有选举，国会两年一次，总统四年一次，但是美国的国会真是垄断资产阶级清一色的国会，无论在英国、法国、意大利、日本，都没有这样清一色的国会，因为在英、法、意、日这些国家的国会，或多或少总还有一些劳动人民的代表。在美国垄断资产阶级国会里面，连代表中小资产阶级的人也为数很少，代表劳动人民的就更没有了。所以它是百分之百的垄断资产阶级的专政，一切都是为了保证垄断资产阶级取得最大限度的利润，美国的自由民主，实质就是如此。这种自由民主，我们不要。我们要的是以生产资料公有制为基础的社会主义的民主和自由，这是真正为广大人民群众所享有的民主和自由。现在我国人民民主制度，就是属于这一类型的。
    人民民主和资产阶级民主相反，资产阶级民主是少数人的民主和少数人对大多数人的专政，人民民主是大多数人的民主和大多数人对少数人的专政。也就是人民对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义及对其他反革命分子的专政，它的目的是为了建立伟大的社会主义事业。因为这事业是人民共同的事业，它必须依靠广大人民群众的积极参加，和一切阻力进行斗争，这就决定了人民民主的代表广泛性和内容的真实性，在全国和各地方政治协商会议及各级人民代表会议的组织上、工作上，充分反映了这种精神，在国家机关、企业、学校、人民团体经常进行的自下而上的批评与自我批评，也反映了这种精神。最近中共中央提出的各民主党派“长期共存，互相监督”，和文艺界学术界的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，使我国民主生活更为丰富。其次，由于社会主义建设必须是有组织、有领导的进行，所以人民民主也是有组织、有领导的，这就是民主集中制。在我国人民民主制度中起领导作用的是工人阶级及其先锋队——中国共产党。因为中国共产党是大公无私的，是以马克思列宁主义武装起来的，又是具有丰富的革命经验的。所以它能够正确地掌握事物发展规律、能够密切联系人民群众、团结全国六亿人民像一个巨人一样，忘我的劳动为伟大的社会主义改造和建设而奋斗，并在短短几年间在政治、经济、文化、外交、国防各方面，都取得了惊人的成就。
    我几年来一直在上海对外贸易系统工作，亲身体会到祖国社会主义事业的突飞猛进，表现在对外贸易的发展，也是空前巨大的。就以上海工业品的出口发展情况来说，1956年仅仅中国杂品出口公司上海分公司一家，经营出口的工业品，外汇总值约可换回一百万吨的钢材。对资本主义市场出口部分，1956年大约是1954年出口实绩的十二倍。如果以整个上海口岸的出口来说，据我所知工业品的出口要占上海出口总值的50％，这些工业品行销到五十三个国家和地区，遍及世界的五大洲。这情况反映什么问题呢？第一、它说明，由于我国国民经济的迅速高涨，反应到对外贸易上也有迅速的扩大与发展。第二、它说明我国工业生产在国民经济比重中不断地增长，反应出我国出口商品也起了很大变化。那就是我国传统以农副产品出口为主的，现在工业品已逐渐成为出口的主要商品了。但以棉布为例，去年出口的数量虽约为历史出口最高年的八倍，仅占全国内销量的5％左右。可见工业品出口的潜力还是很大的。这些难道是人们在帝国主义、官僚资本主义、封建主义的反动统治时期所能梦想得到的吗？难道不是我们伟大的祖国在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，社会主义建设事业突飞猛进的标志之一吗？所以尽管美国政府从1950年以来就对我国实行所谓封锁禁运，丝毫不能阻止我们对外贸易的发展，正像它不承认中华人民共和国和六亿人民的存在，丝毫不能影响我们国家沿着社会主义道路推进和壮大起来，也不能影响我们国家在国际事务中的地位一天比一天提高。
    今天，作为一个中国人民是很光荣的，周总理最近访问十一个国家所得到的崇高的信誉，更说明了这一点。留在大陆的中国“自由”“民主”分子，就这样到处看到祖国社会主义事业成就的伟大，因而越来越信服他们自己所选择跟中国共产党，跟中国人民走的道路是完全正确的，光明的。他们越来越坚定了社会主义的信念，愿从学习、工作及社会生活中，改造自己，逐渐变成或正在变成社会主义积极分子了。
    如果现在投靠美国的中国“自由”“民主”分子，还幻想在中国大陆上找到你们的朋友作呼应，那真是痴人作梦。你们口口声声反蒋，但你们走的美帝国主义路线，和蒋集团一样，蒋介石集团反人民、反祖国，你们也反人民、反祖国。现在正当蒋介石集团里已经有越来越多的人感到这条路线走不通，要作浪子回头的打算的时候，你们却打起什么“毁党救国”的旗帜，企图到台湾来代替蒋介石。算了吧，什么“毁党救国”，你们是想要毁国自毁。但人民的中国，一天比一天强大就像太阳上升一样，世界上没有任何力量可以阻挡得了。台湾是我国的领土，不管是谁，要想卖身投靠美帝在那里保持和祖国决裂的状态都是人民不容许的。今天你们只有挣脱美帝国主义的牢笼，回到祖国的怀抱来，一同参加伟大的社会主义建设，才是你们应走的道路，祖国大门是开着等待每一个愿意回头之人的。（附图片）
