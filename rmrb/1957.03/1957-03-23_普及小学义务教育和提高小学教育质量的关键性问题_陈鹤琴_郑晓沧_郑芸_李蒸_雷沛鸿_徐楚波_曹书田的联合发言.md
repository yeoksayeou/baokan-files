We wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao's important instructions at the Supreme State Conference and Chairman Zhou Enlai's report at the CPPCC. We also agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report.

Now, we would like to talk about "the main key issues concerning the popularization of compulsory primary education and the improvement of the quality of primary education."

In the years since liberation, the people's material life and socialist consciousness have gradually improved. Everyone believes that if their children are not educated, it will be difficult for them to gain a foothold in socialist society and better serve the motherland and the people in the future. They urgently demand that their children receive at least compulsory primary education. Moreover, many people know the fine tradition that "even if the family is poor, books must be read," so they would rather tighten their belts than not let their children go to school. Because everyone hopes that their children can receive a better education, they also urgently demand that primary schools be run better and that the quality of education be improved.

The Party and the People's Government are aware of the people's urgent demands. Therefore, the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967" and the "Eighth National Congress" documents repeatedly mentioned "popularizing compulsory primary education"; the "Eighth National Congress" documents also mentioned "improving the quality of education."

However, although more than 63 million children (including overage children) were enrolled in schools in China in 1956, the number of school-age children who were not enrolled still accounted for about 40% of all school-age children. How to ensure that these 40% of school-age children are enrolled according to plan in less than twelve years has not yet been determined with a specific plan. The quality of primary education is also not high, especially the quality of education in rural primary schools is even worse, far from satisfying the people.

What are the reasons why the popularization of compulsory primary education and the improvement of the quality of primary education have not achieved significant results? We believe that the main key lies in the instability and insufficient amount of primary education funding.

Primary education funding is certainly more stable and increased more than before liberation. But the problem has not been solved.

In addition to collecting tuition and miscellaneous fees from children for administrative, maintenance, and equipment expenses, primary education funding for teachers' salaries is centrally allocated by the central government. In 1956, the central government's unified expenditure accounted for about 2.60% of the total state expenditure, but it was still far less than that of the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries. In socialist countries, ordinary education funding accounts for about 10% of the total expenditure, and most of it is used for primary education. China's primary school system is particularly large, and funding is particularly small. Each primary school child's "annual fee" is only thirteen or fourteen yuan, which is five or six times less than that of middle school students (middle school students are about eighty to one hundred yuan), and forty times less than that of university students (university students are about six hundred to seven hundred yuan), so the conditions in primary schools are particularly poor. Not only are school buildings often dilapidated and in disrepair for many years, even causing collapses and casualties, but the equipment is also simple, lacking intuitive teaching aids, and even children's desks and stools are made of "adobe." Moreover, the teacher staffing is tight, and the workload is heavy (teachers often spend more than ten to twelve hours a day attending classes, preparing lessons, correcting homework, studying, and doing other work), leaving them no time to study and improve teaching methods, let alone "manage and teach," and no time to pay attention to children's moral character education. They are often so busy and tired that they become ill, and there are many sick people who often go to class while sick, regardless of whether chronic infectious diseases will harm children. In such a situation, it is more difficult to improve teaching methods as soon as possible and improve the quality of education.

If compulsory primary education cannot be popularized step by step according to plan, and the quality of primary education cannot be gradually improved, all parents with children and all people who care about the education of the next generation cannot but be very anxious. Therefore, we advocate:

1.  No matter how difficult the state finances are, compulsory primary education must be planned as soon as possible so that it can be gradually popularized according to plan in less than twelve years. The quality of primary education must also create conditions in a timely manner so that it can be gradually improved.

2.  To popularize compulsory primary education, although it is currently possible to advocate privately-run, community-run, and even "children's literacy classes" in areas lacking primary schools, national basic education of a socialist nature must be uniformly managed by the state in the future in accordance with the principle of "overall planning and appropriate arrangements" to avoid laissez-faire or local governments acting on their own, or even being biased due to uneven local wealth.

3.  To improve the quality of primary education, in addition to the education department's planned improvement of teaching materials and teaching guides, as well as improving the level of teachers: 1. The phenomenon of being busy and chaotic must be overcome, and teachers must focus on teaching; 2. The staffing must be relaxed and the burden on teachers must be reduced so that teachers have time to "guide" while "managing and teaching"; 3. Primary school buildings, in addition to a part being built and repaired by the people themselves, should be planned by the state as a whole, especially urban primary school buildings, which must be uniformly arranged in urban planning and gradually built; 4. Primary school teaching equipment must also be planned by the state with a certain amount of funding.

4.  Although it is a special measure left over from history to collect tuition and miscellaneous fees from children in primary schools, it is ultimately unreasonable and must be corrected in districts and phases in the next few years.

To implement the above proposals, we suggest:

1.  Although the proportion of education funding in the total state expenditure cannot be increased suddenly like in socialist countries, the percentage of primary education funding in the total state expenditure must be increased year by year, gradually increasing to a sufficient amount to specifically plan to implement compulsory primary education, and improve conditions and improve the quality of primary education.

2.  The salary status of teachers must be determined according to the principle of "remuneration according to work," based on the amount of work and the complexity of the labor. The salaries of rural primary school teachers should not be compared with the income of farmers, nor should they be too different from the salaries of urban primary school teachers and teachers above the middle school level. Moreover, the amount of salaries should be gradually increased with economic development, so that primary school teachers will not be unwilling or uneasy to work for primary education, especially unwilling to go to the countryside to be rural primary school teachers, and it will not be easy to recruit students for normal schools.

    普及小学义务教育和提高小学教育质量的关键性问题
    陈鹤琴　郑晓沧　郑芸　李蒸　雷沛鸿  徐楚波　曹书田的联合发言
    我们衷心拥护毛主席在最高国务会议的重要指示和政协周恩来主席所作的报告。对于李富春副总理的说明和陈叔通副主席的工作报告，也都表示同意。
    现在，我们想谈一谈“关于普及小学义务教育和提高小学教育质量的主要的关键性问题”。
    我国在解放后的近几年来，人民的物质生活和社会主义觉悟，已经逐步提高了。大家认为子女不受教育，将来很难立足于社会主义社会更好地为祖国和人民服务，迫切要求子女至少能受小学义务教育。而且有许多人是知道“家虽贫，书不可不读”的优良传统的，所以宁愿束紧裤带，也不能不让子女入学。大家因为希望子女能受到比较好的教育，还迫切要求小学办得好些，教育质量提得高些。
    党和人民政府是知道人民的迫切要求的，所以“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）”和“八大”文件中，不止一次地提到“普及小学义务教育”；“八大”文件中还提到要“提高教育质量”。
    但是我国在1956年间入学儿童（连超龄儿童在内）虽然已达到了六千三百多万，而没有入学的学龄儿童却还约占全部学龄儿童的40％左右。如何在十二年不到的时期里，使这40％的学龄儿童按计划入学，到现在还没有能够定出具体的计划来。小学教育质量也是不高的，尤其是乡村小学的教育质量更差，远远不能使人民感到满意。
    普及小学义务教育和提高小学教育质量所以不能有显著的成效，原因何在呢？我们以为主要的关键，就在小学教育经费不稳定和数量不足这个问题上。
    小学教育经费，当然比解放前稳定并且增加得多了。但是问题还没有解决。
    小学教育经费，除了向儿童收学杂费以作行政、修缮、添置等经费以外，教师的工资是由中央统支的。在1956年，中央统支的经费约占国家总支出的2．60％左右，但是还远不及苏联和东欧各社会主义国家。各社会主义国家，普通教育经费约占总支出的10％左右，大半用在小学教育方面。我国小学摊子特别大，经费特别少，每个小学儿童的“岁费”只十三、四元，比中学生小五、六倍（中学生约八十—一百元），比大学生小四十倍（大学生约六百—七百元），所以小学的条件也特别差。不但校舍往往多年失修，破旧不堪，甚至发生倒塌、伤亡事故，设备简陋，缺乏直观教具，甚至儿童的桌凳也是用“土坯”堆砌成的；而且教师编制紧，工作量重（每天上课、备课、改作业、学习和做其他工作，往往在十——十二小时以上），无暇研究、改进教学方法，更无暇“管教又管导”，无暇注意儿童的道德品质教育，甚至忙累成病，病号很多，还往往带病上课，也不管慢性传染病会遗害儿童。这样的情况，要及早改进教学方法，提高教育质量，也就比较不容易了。
    小学义务教育不能定计划逐步普及，小学教育质量，也不能逐步提高，凡是有子女的父母以及关心下一代教育的一切人们是不能不十分着急的。所以我们主张：
    一、国家财政无论如何困难，小学义务教育却不能不早定计划，以便在不到十二年内，按计划逐步普及。小学教育的质量，也不能不及时创造条件，以便逐步提高。
    二、要普及小学义务教育，目前虽然不妨在缺乏小学的地方，提倡民办、社办，甚至办“儿童识字班”；但是社会主义性质的国民基础教育，将来必须由国家依照“统筹兼顾，适当安排”的方针，统一办理，以免放任自流，或者由地方各自为政，甚至因地方贫富不均而有所偏颇。
    三、要提高小学教育质量，除了由教育部门按计划改进教材和教学指导书以及提高教师水平之外：1、必须克服忙乱现象，让教师面向教学；2、必须放宽编制，减轻教师负担，让教师“管教”的同时有暇“管导”；3、小学校舍，除了一部分由人民自建、自修之外，大部分由国家统筹，尤其是城市小学校舍，必须统一安排在城市规划中，逐步修建；4、小学教学设备，也必须由国家划出一定的经费来，统筹安排。
    四、小学向儿童收学杂费，虽然是历史所遗留下来的特殊措施，但究竟是不合理的，必须在今后若干年内，分区分期改正这个不合理现象。
    要实行上述主张，我们建议：
    一、教育经费在国家总支出中的比重，虽然不能和社会主义各国一样骤然提高，但是小学教育经费在国家总支出中的百分比，必须逐年、逐步增加，逐渐增加到有足够的数量，以便具体计划实施小学义务教育，并且改善条件，提高小学教育的质量。
    二、教师的工资地位，必须依照“按劳计酬”的原则，视工作量多少和劳动的复杂与否而予以确定。乡村小学教师的工资，不能和农民的收入相比，也不能和城市小学教师以及中学以上教师大相悬殊，而且还要随着经济的发展而逐步提高工资数量，以免小学教师不甘心、不安心于为小学教育工作，尤其是不愿下乡为乡村小学教师，师范学校招生也不容易招到。
