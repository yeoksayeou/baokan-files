Since the implementation of construction in our country, the First Five-Year Plan has been completed one year ahead of schedule. Both heavy and light industries have greatly increased production. Basic means of production have made even more significant progress. Compared with the old China before liberation, it is truly full of vitality, which makes us rejoice and be encouraged by the birth of socialist New China.

We have unwavering confidence in the great achievements of industrialization construction, but at the same time, we recognize that this is only the initial stage of progress. Although the production capacity of major products has leaped forward compared with before liberation, it is still very backward compared with advanced countries in the world, considering our large population and vast territory. We must not be complacent about this.

The experience gained in the First Five-Year Plan can be used as a reference for the Second Five-Year Plan. The First Five-Year Plan was completed in 1956. The Second Five-Year Plan will begin in 1958. The year 1957, which lies in between, is the preparation period for the Second Five-Year Plan. In 1956, the amount of investment in our country was unprecedentedly large, and the positive effects obtained were also particularly important. At the same time, the phenomenon of extravagance and waste in some aspects had also developed excessively. In this year of 1957, it is very appropriate for our government to strengthen the increase of production and frugality, make overall plans for priorities, remedy deviations and make up for deficiencies, and accumulate and distribute funds more rationally. However, for the sake of the Second Five-Year Plan and the entire economic future, we must not abandon our aspiration to strive for full progress from a backward position. With the help of the great friendship of the Soviet Union and in cooperation with fraternal countries, we must make plans that meet our needs in terms of production equipment and technical methods and move forward vigorously.

Last winter, members of the CPPCC, together with people's representatives, inspected various places. Recently, a symposium on inspection work was held to discuss the issues in several sessions. Everyone felt that basic means of production, such as coal, steel, oil, and electricity, have increased production a lot, but they are still in short supply, and the gap is large. Transportation, especially railway transportation, which undertakes the main tasks, is also very tight. These all have a fundamental relationship to economic development, and everyone believes that there is a need to find ways to alleviate the situation. Regarding these issues, I would like to offer some immature suggestions during this speech.

First, let's talk about the main fuels, coal and oil. Our country has abundant natural resources of both coal and oil, but the geographical distribution is quite different. Coalfields with huge reserves are mostly located in densely populated areas north of the Yangtze River with convenient transportation. The cost of mining is low, and the transportation distance is convenient. Our country has this advantage and can naturally undertake the task of producing a large amount of coal. The coal produced will not only promote inland industry, but also have a surplus for export to supply neighboring countries. Plans for fully developing coalfields and coal mines in Shanxi and Henan should take into account foreign trade.

First, let's talk about domestic supply. The Northeast has already produced a lot of coal. However, the vast Northwest region, which is under construction, does not yet have enough coal mines to supply. Transporting coal from the Northeast to the Northwest by rail is a long and costly journey, which is extremely uneconomical. The railway is already feeling too burdened. On the other hand, Shanxi has the richest coal deposits in the country, with little water and solid rock, and low costs. However, the distribution of the Datong-Puzhou Railway has not taken into account the transportation of coal to the Northwest, so Shanxi coal mines have not been fully developed so far. After the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway is opened, part of the Datong coal can be transported to Lanzhou. For a more abundant supply, it is best to extend the southern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway westward, cross the Yellow River, and enter Shaanxi to connect with Xi'an. In this way, the coal in the Fen River Basin can be transported to the Northwest in large quantities.

Another coal-using area is the Yangtze River Basin from Wuhan to Shanghai. In addition to the existing Huainan mines, Henan has the Pingdingshan large coalfield, and vast coalfields have also been discovered between Anhui and Jiangsu provinces. They should all be developed in large quantities and transported southward to meet the booming sales.

Since the major coalfields are all located in the east, a considerable amount can be exported to neighboring countries after large-scale development. These neighboring countries are not rich in coal mines and are waiting for our country to supply them. Our country can increase export trade, accumulate foreign exchange funds, which is very beneficial to industrial construction. Therefore, foreign trade needs should be considered in our country's coal mine plans. Western natural oil should be developed with different priorities; the eastern region should develop oil shale industry.

As far as we know, the major oil fields are centered in the Northwest, west of Lanzhou. Yumen is in production, Xinjiang's Karamay is believed to be a first-class rich oil area, Qaidam also has hope, and there are several other areas that are expected to develop. These places will surely become a large source of oil in our country in the future. However, under the current transportation situation, these oil areas are vast and sparsely populated, and the distance is far, so it will inevitably require a lot of investment and success cannot be achieved quickly. Therefore, our country's oil production must proceed gradually with different priorities in order to obtain the ability to be partially self-sufficient. The implementation methods should be well coordinated with the progress of railway transportation, or use part of the oil pipeline transportation as a supplement.

On the other hand, abundant reserves of oil shale are known to exist in the Northeast and South China. The Fushun Refinery already has a good foundation, but the Fushun Coal Mine cannot fully supply oil shale, resulting in a decrease rather than an increase in the refinery's output. Methods of cooperation between mines and factories should be determined as soon as possible, and the scale of the refinery should be expanded. South China urgently needs oil products, and after the completion of Zhanjiang Port, ocean shipping will especially need oil products supply. The oil shale mines are not far away, and a refinery of appropriate scale should be established as soon as possible. The locations of oil plants in the Northeast and South China can just supplement what the Northwest's oil supply cannot reach. In the current period, developing natural oil in the west and developing oil shale industry in the east, advancing on both fronts, is a rational policy. Moreover, refining oil from oil shale can also produce a large amount of ammonium sulfate, which is a chemical fertilizer necessary for our country's agricultural production. Utilizing Natural Conditions, Emphasizing Hydropower Generation; Central Thermal Power Plants Can Be Set Up in Large Coal Mining Areas

Electricity is a basic condition for the development of industry. Our country has begun construction and has seen results, but it should be expanded. I would like to provide reference opinions in two points. First, hydropower generation should be valued. Our country's terrain is high in the west and low in the east, so hundreds of rivers flow eastward, with many dangerous cliffs and rapids. The Qinling and Nanling mountains, which run across the Central Plains, create rapid streams and canyons. These are all natural conditions that make our country's hydropower generation investment particularly light. The construction cost of our country's hydropower stations is not more expensive than thermal power stations, and sometimes even slightly cheaper. After completion, it not only saves a lot of coal and supplies cheap power, but also prevents floods, irrigates farmland, and facilitates navigation. Second, central thermal power plants can be set up in large coal mining areas. At present, it is of course good to set up cogeneration plants in various industrial centers with high automation. However, thermal power plants require a large amount of coal. If factories are built near coal mines to generate electricity, the coal will be close and cheap, and the cost of electricity will be greatly reduced. Using the above two methods, supplying through the power grid can obtain a large amount of cheap power, which will definitely be beneficial to reducing production costs. The specifications and density of railways should be coordinated with production; increased production of chemical fertilizers should promote agricultural development. Remarkable achievements have also been made in the construction of new railways during the First Five-Year Plan period. The reason for the current transportation tension is that the equipment of certain existing routes cannot handle a large amount of cargo, and the railway construction has not been well coordinated with the needs of large-scale production areas. For example, the Jinghan Railway and the Longhai Railway intersect vertically and horizontally in Henan Province, which is a good arrangement. However, these two railways were not originally prepared for the transportation of modern production, so they are now difficult to cope with. When the Pingdingshan vertical shaft is opened and produces a large amount of coal during the Second Five-Year Plan period, and the Sanmenxia water conservancy and power project is gradually completed, and industry and agriculture develop accordingly, the transportation will be even more congested. As can be seen from this, the railway specifications and railway density must be well coordinated with the amount of production in order to cope happily.

The largest share of railway transportation is coal. Therefore, railroads of adequate capacity must be built wherever there are large coal mines and routes that supply large amounts of coal. In the Northwest, oil is the main product. If 5 million to 10 million tons of oil are to be produced annually, the existing railways cannot bear this task and should be supplemented as soon as possible. That is to say, it seems that the railway plan should be strengthened fundamentally.

Our country's capacity to produce steel, coal, and electricity is roughly comparable to that of Czechoslovakia and Poland, but their population is only more than 10 million or nearly 30 million, while our country's population is 600 million, which is dozens of times more. Therefore, while they have made remarkable achievements, we are still insignificant. The length of our existing railways is far less than that of India. It can be seen that the amount of industrialization construction needed in our country is still extremely huge.

Light industry can be built in even greater quantities to increase corporate profits and directly benefit people's lives. However, many light industries require agricultural products for supply. Cotton textile factories need cotton, and sugar factories need sugarcane. If the supply of agricultural products is insufficient, factories will not be able to produce smoothly. Therefore, actively promoting agricultural production is also a current priority. Among many promotion methods, industrial methods should also be strengthened. What is particularly important is chemical fertilizer. The current production volume is far from sufficient and must be stepped up.

China's large population is the crown of the world. The relationship of construction plans should be viewed from two perspectives. In terms of consumption, a population of 600 million is certainly a significant burden on our economy. We should promote a thrifty and simple life to avoid all waste. In terms of production, the hard work and creative inventions of 600 million people are an unparalleled force in the world. It should be well utilized to improve our country's economic capabilities.

The people of the whole country have a long patriotic heart and are willing to contribute their strength under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party to build our country into an advanced socialist industrialized country. With such enthusiastic support from the broad masses of the people, it is firmly believed that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, our country's construction achievements will surpass the past and create a brilliant and bright scene.

    关于发展基本生产资料和铁路运输的建议
    翁文灏  王家桢的联合发言
    我国实行建设以来，第一个五年计划已提先一年完成。重工业和轻工业都大量增产。基本生产资料更有重大发展。同解放以前的旧中国相比真是生机焕发，使我们对社会主义新中国的诞生，欢欣鼓舞。
    我们对于工业化建设的宏大成就深信不疑，但我们同时认识这只是前进的初期。主要物产的生产能力同解放前相比虽已突飞猛进，但同世界先进各国相比，则以我国人口之多和领土之广，依然是十分落后。我们决不可以此自满。
    第一个五年计划所得经验正可作第二个五年计划的参考。第一个五年计划已在1956年完成。第二个五年计划是从1958年开始。介在其间的1957年是第二个五年计划的准备时期。1956年内我国投资数量空前宏大，所得的积极功效也是特殊重要，同时在若干方面铺张浪费的现象也曾有过分的发展。在1957这一年内，我国政府加强增产节约，统筹缓急，救偏补弊，更为合理地积累和分配资金，这是很为适当的政策。但为第二个五年计划和整个经济出路打算，我们不可放弃从落后地位争取充分前进的志愿。我们，在苏联伟大友谊援助下和兄弟国家协作中，必须在生产设备和技术方法上，做切合需要的计划，向前猛进。
    去年冬间，政协委员偕同人民代表往各地视察，近时举行视察工作座谈会，分次讨论，大家觉得基本生产资料如同煤、钢、石油、电力等虽已增产很多，但仍不敷供应，所差很大；运输，尤其是担任主要任务的铁路运输，也很紧张。这都对经济发展有根本关系，大家认为有设法和缓的需要。对于这些问题，愿在这发言时间，试作一些不很成熟的建议。
    先就主要燃料煤和石油来说。煤和石油我国都保有天然富源，但地理分布颇有不同。储量宏大的煤田多位于长江以北人口繁盛交通近便的地区，开采成本既轻，运输路途又便，我国有此便利，天然可负起大量产煤的任务。所产的煤不但推动内地工业，而且可有余量出口，以供应邻邦的用途。充分开发山西河南等地煤田煤矿计划要照顾对外贸易
    先说内地供应。东北已产煤颇多。但正在建设的西北广大地区则还没有足够供应的煤矿。用东北的煤由铁路运往西北，途遥费巨，极不经济，铁路方面已感负担太重。另一方面，山西煤藏丰富冠于全国，水少石固，成本低廉，只因同蒲铁路的分布没有顾到把煤运往西北，以致迄今山西煤矿还没有充分开发。包兰铁路通后，大同煤可有一部分运往兰州。为更裕供应计，最好把同蒲路的南段向西延长，渡黄河，入陕西，以接于西安。如此则汾河流域的煤可以大量运往西北。
    另一用煤地区是从武汉到上海的长江流域。除了现存的淮南矿外，河南有平顶山大煤田，皖苏两省间也已发现广大煤田，都宜大量开发，向南运输，以供方兴未艾的销路。
    各大煤田既皆位于东部，大规模开发后，定可有相当数量输出海外邻国。这些邻国煤矿不富，正有待于我国的接济。我国借此增多输出贸易，积累外汇资金，极有益于工业建设。因此，我国煤矿计划中应当考虑到对外贸易的需要。分别缓急开发西部天然石油东部地区应发展油页岩工业
    重大油田所在，照目前所知，以兰州以西的西北为中心。玉门正在生产，新疆克拉玛依可信为头等丰富大油区，柴达木也有希望，此外还有好几个区域可望发展。这些地方将来必成为我国石油的大量来源。但在目前交通形势下，这些油区地广人少，距离遥远，自必投资很多，成功不能很快。因此，我国石油生产必须分别缓急，逐步前进，以得到局部自给的能力。进行方法应与铁路运输的进展善为配合，或用一部分油管运输，以资补充。
    另一方面，东北和华南已知有储量丰富的油母页岩。抚顺炼厂已有良好基础，但抚顺煤矿不能将油页岩充分供给，以致炼厂产量有减无增。亟应确定矿厂协作方法，并扩大炼厂规模。华南方面急需油品，湛江港告成后，远洋航运尤极需油品供应。油页岩矿地相距不远，应早建立适当规模的炼厂。东北和华南油厂所在都正可补充西北石油供应之所不及。在目前这个时期，西部开发天然石油，东部发展油页岩工业，双方并进，是一个合理的政策。而且用油页岩炼油还可出产多量硫酸錏，为我国农业生产所必需的化学肥料。利用天然条件重视水力发电大量采煤区可设中心火电站
    电力为发展工业的基本条件。我国开始建设，已见成效，但还宜扩大。所愿提供参考的意见可分两点。一是水力发电应当看重。我国地形西高东低，所以百川东流，具有好些危崖激湍，横贯中原的又有秦岭和南岭山脉，造成急流峡谷，这都是使我国取得水力发电投资特轻的天然条件。我国水力电站的建设用费并不比火力电站为贵，有时且略为较廉。建成后，不但节省大量煤炭和供给廉价动力，而且可以防止洪水，灌溉农田和便利航运。二是大量采煤区内可设立中心火力电站。目前在各工业中心分设热电站，高度自动，当然是好的。但火力电站需要大量煤炭。如果在煤矿近旁设厂发电，则路近煤廉，电力的成本必大为低落。使用上列两种方法，用电力网来供应，可以得到量多而价廉的动力，于降低生产成本，自必有益。铁路规格密度应与生产配合多产化学肥料促进农业发展新铁路的建设在第一个五年计划期内也已有卓越成绩。推究现在运输紧张的原因，是在现存某些路线的设备不能胜任大量货物，也在对于大量生产地区的需要铁路建设还没有善为配合。举例来说，河南省内京汉路和陇海路纵横交错，布置是好的。但这两条路原来没有准备近代生产的运输，所以现在已不易胜任。等到第二个五年计划期内，平顶山直井开成，大量产煤，三门峡水利电力工程逐步完成，工农业随着发展，那时运输将更拥塞。又如西北方面，好些地方正在大规模建设，陇海路本来没有准备这么多的运输，困难可想而知。从此可见，铁路规格和铁路密度必须与生产份量善为配合，然后才能胜任愉快。
    铁路运输份量最大的是煤。因此，凡大煤矿所在和大宗煤炭供应的路线，必须建立能力相当的铁路。西北方面，石油为主要物产，如要每年生产五百万到一千万吨的石油，现存铁路不能负担这个任务，应当从早加以补充。这就是说，铁路计划似乎基本上更要加强。
    我国产钢产煤的能力和发电的数量大致可与捷克斯洛伐克和波兰相比，但他们人口只有一千多万乃至近三千万，而我国人口六万万，相差几十倍之多，所以在他们已成绩斐然，而在我国仍渺乎其小。我国现存铁路长度比印度还远不能及。可见我国需要工业化建设的份量还极为巨大。
    轻工业可以更为加量建设，以提高企业利润，且直接有益于人民生活。可是许多轻工业都需要农产供应。棉纺织厂需要棉花，糖厂需要甘蔗。农产供应不足，工厂便不能顺利生产。所以积极促进农业生产也为当前要务。在好些促进方法之中，工业方法也应当加强。尤可看重的是化学肥料，目前生产份量是十分不够的，必须加紧建设。
    中国人口众多冠于世界，对于建设计划的关系可从两方面来看。消费方面，六亿人口当然是我国经济的重大负担，我们应提倡俭约朴素的生活，以避免一切浪费。生产方面，则六亿人的勤劳操作和创造发明，正是世界上无可比拟的大力，应当善为发挥，以提高我国的经济能力。
    全国人民爱国心长，共愿在中国共产党领导下，贡献力量，把我国建成为社会主义工业化的先进国。在广大民众这样的热诚支持下，深信在第二个五年计划期内，我国建设成绩，更将超越从前，造成灿烂光明的景象。（发言的代表是翁文灏）（附图片）
