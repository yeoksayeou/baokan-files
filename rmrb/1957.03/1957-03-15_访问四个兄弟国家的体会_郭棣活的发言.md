I enthusiastically support Chairman Mao's speech and Premier Zhou's report, and I agree with the special reports of the leading comrades.

Now, I would like to talk about some of my experiences and opinions from my recent participation in the National People's Congress delegation's visit to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria.

(1) Mutual visits and mutual learning between countries
    The Soviet Union has visited many countries in the past year or so, and has also invited parliamentary delegations from many countries to visit the Soviet Union. Our friendly visit to brotherly countries this time is to further deepen our mutual understanding, enhance friendship and strengthen unity, and learn from their advanced experiences. In many cities and villages of the brotherly countries we visited, and in participating in various activities, and visiting many factories, farms, cultural and educational undertakings, we were warmly welcomed and kindly received. They regarded China's achievements in socialist construction as their own achievements, and were very interested in China's agricultural and handicraft cooperation, and in the socialist transformation of China's capitalist industry and commerce. I personally saw the prosperity and development of industry and agriculture and the happy lives of the people in the brotherly countries, which made me realize that this is the result of advancing victoriously along the path of the great October Revolution, and it is also a vivid illustration of the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. The various happy and joyful lives of the people in the brotherly countries made me further realize that only by realizing socialist industrialization can the continuous development of industrial and agricultural production be promoted, and only based on the continuous development of production can the people's lives be continuously improved. The brotherly countries, especially the Soviet Union today, are indeed our tomorrow.

(2) Expanding and developing the international united front
    This is a particularly important task at present. The vast majority of mankind in the world are against war and love peace. Through various mutual visits between countries, especially like Premier Zhou's visit to eleven countries in Asia and Europe, the unity and friendship between countries can be strengthened and enhanced. We need the close unity of socialist countries, the close unity of nationally independent countries and all peace-loving countries and peoples, in order to have a peaceful international environment for the peaceful construction of each country. In recent years, more and more foreign guests have come to visit China, and more and more of our people have gone to visit various countries. It is estimated that this will increase greatly in the future. I think our Party and government organs, democratic parties, people's organizations, and all aspects should pay more attention to and do a good job in receiving foreign guests. During this visit to the brotherly countries, we saw that their reception of us was worthy of our learning in many aspects, such as the use of Chinese slogans at mass rallies, the use of Chinese characters in welcome banners in various cities, factories, and farms, and the use of Chinese slogans in the newspapers of various countries to welcome our visit. In order to strive for lasting world peace, in order to enhance friendship and strengthen unity, we must expand and develop the international united front, and mutual visits between countries are a good method.

(3) Great, beautiful, clean cities
    And lush forests
    From the places we passed by plane, train, and car, we saw the beautiful cities and scenery of the brotherly countries, especially their forests. The brotherly countries attach great importance to protecting forests and increasing the area of forests. Their forests account for a considerable proportion of the national area (26%-34%), while the forest area in our country is less than 10%. In order to meet the needs of a country, it is necessary to reach 25% of the forest area. In terms of urban construction, cleanliness, and hygiene, and protecting and increasing the forest area, we should learn from the brotherly countries.

(4) Develop and increase production
    To continuously improve the material and cultural life of the people, we need to greatly develop and increase industrial and agricultural production. The brotherly countries have adopted various methods to encourage increased industrial and agricultural production. For example, in the Uzbek Republic of the Soviet Union, great achievements have been made in cotton planting in recent years. 750,000 farmers used 1.4 million hectares of land to produce 2.86 million tons of seed cotton in 1956 (equivalent to more than 20 million dan of lint cotton). We visited a collective farm that mainly grows cotton. 95% of the cotton planting to harvesting work is mechanized. In the past, each hectare of cotton produced 12 quintals of seed cotton. Now it has generally been increased to 24 quintals. This farm guarantees the state that each hectare will produce 35 quintals of seed cotton, and the production result is 41 quintals of seed cotton per hectare. The state's purchase price of seed cotton is as follows: Each hectare - 24 quintals are purchased at 3.40 rubles per kilogram. The purchase price of seed cotton from 25-35 quintals produced per hectare is increased by 50%. The purchase price of seed cotton produced above 35 quintals per hectare is increased by 100%. Czechoslovakia also adopts various encouragement methods to promote the enthusiasm of farmers to increase production. The unit yield of agriculture in Czechoslovakia is relatively high, with wheat yields reaching 500 jin per mu. The unit yield of agriculture in our country needs to be greatly improved, and the advanced experience of the brotherly countries in various methods and measures for agriculture is worthy of our reference and learning.

(5) Increase in power generation, decrease in electricity prices
    The amount of power generation and the level of electricity prices in a country are important factors in determining the industrialization and modernization of people's lives in that country. To develop a country's electricity industry, it is necessary to vigorously develop hydropower to obtain cheap electricity, which is closely related to improving people's lives. Because the Soviet Union's hydropower industry is particularly developed, its power generation in 1956 was as high as 192 billion kilowatt-hours, so electricity prices are very cheap (in the Soviet Union, a worker's monthly salary can buy 4,000 kilowatt-hours of household electricity, Romania is 1,000 kilowatt-hours, Bulgaria is 1,500 kilowatt-hours, while in China it is more than 200 kilowatt-hours). When meeting with their responsible comrades in the Soviet Union, I asked him about the relationship between developing hydropower and lowering electricity prices to improve people's lives. They said: "The Soviet Union will continue to develop hydropower extensively to continuously lower electricity prices." Looking back at our China, after the completion of the first five-year plan, there are only 18 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. At present, electricity prices in our country are relatively high, and we must strive to catch up.

(6) Regarding the problem of large auditoriums in organs and factories
    We also participated in mass rallies in factories in the brotherly countries. These rallies were not held in large auditoriums (most factories do not have them) but in the workshops of the factories. In our China, there are also many organs and factories with large auditoriums. When there is not enough housing, insufficient building materials, and not much construction funds, can we check and study the current situation of large auditoriums in various organs and factories?

(7) Problems of students and graduate students studying abroad
    We have seen our Chinese students and graduate students in all the brotherly countries. They are very diligent, very hardworking, and their results are relatively good. In order to further achieve greater results and learn more scientific and technological and socialist management methods, can we consider requiring students to participate in one to two years of practical work (related to the subjects they study abroad) in China before sending them to study abroad, because with such work experience, their achievements in absorbing and learning from the advanced experience of the brotherly countries may be better. At the same time, I suggest that more graduate students be sent to study abroad in the future, because it is estimated that their results may be faster and greater.

(8) Improve efficiency and save time
    Vice Premier Chen Yun's report on increasing production and practicing economy should be given special attention and implemented by each of us. I think saving time is also very important. Have we paid enough attention to saving time in the past few years? Are there too many or too long meetings? The duration of meetings in the brotherly countries is not very long. I hope that in the future, all aspects can consider and make full and reasonable use of everyone's time, improve efficiency, and save time, so that everyone can better and more contribute their greatest efforts to serve socialist construction.

The above experiences and opinions may be incorrect, please correct me, comrades.

    访问四个兄弟国家的体会
    郭棣活的发言
    我热烈拥护毛主席的讲话和周总理的报告，并同意各位首长的专题报告。
    现在，我想谈一谈关于最近我参加全国人民代表大会访问苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚和保加利亚的几点体会和意见。
    （1）各国互相访问，互相学习
    苏联在这一年多来曾访问过许多国家，同时也邀请很多国家议会代表团访问过苏联。我们这次到兄弟国家进行友好访问，是为进一步加深我们之间的相互了解，增进友谊和加强团结，并且学习他们的先进经验。所到的兄弟国家许多城市和乡村，参加各种的访问活动，参观很多工厂、农庄、文教事业，都受到热烈的欢迎和亲切的接待。他们对于中国社会主义建设的成就看做是自己的成就，对中国的农业和手工业的合作化，对于中国的资本主义工商业的社会主义改造都很感兴趣。我亲眼看见了兄弟国家工农业的繁荣发展得到辉煌的成就和人民的幸福生活，使我认识，这是沿着伟大的十月革命道路胜利前进的结果，也正是社会主义制度无比优越性的生动说明。兄弟国家人民的种种幸福愉快的生活，使我具体地进一步认识，只有实现社会主义的工业化，才能促使工农业生产的不断发展，也只有基于生产的不断发展，人民的生活才能不断地得到提高。兄弟国家，特别是苏联的今天，的确是我们的明天。
    （2）扩大和发展国际统一战线
    这是目前一个特别重要的工作，全世界绝大多数人类是反对战争、爱好和平的。通过各国之间的各种互相访问，特别是像周总理的访问亚洲和欧洲十一个国家，各国之间的团结友谊是能得到加强和增进的。我们需要社会主义国家的密切团结，民族独立国家和所有爱好和平的国家和人民的紧密团结，就可能得到一个和平的国际环境来进行各国的和平建设。这几年外宾来中国访问越来越多，我国人民去各国访问也是越来越增加，估计今后还要大大地增加，我认为我们各党政机关、各民主党派、各人民团体和所有各方面，要更加重视和做好这个招待外宾的工作。这次到兄弟国家访问，看见他们接待我们，在许多方面是值得我们学习的，例如群众大会用中国话的口号，各城市，各工厂农庄用中国文字的欢迎标语和各国的报纸登载我们访问的新闻也是用中国的标语欢迎我们。为了争取世界的持久和平，为了增进友谊和加强团结，我们必须扩大和发展国际统一战线工作，而各国之间的互相访问是一个很好的方法。
    （3）伟大、美丽、清洁的城市
  和秀茂的森林
    从飞机、火车和汽车经过的地方，我们都看到各兄弟国家的美丽的城市和风景，特别是他们的森林。兄弟国家是很重视保护森林和增加森林的面积，他们的森林占全国面积相当多的（26％——34％），而我国的森林面积是不到10％。为了满足一个国家的需要，是要达到25％的森林面积。在城市建设、在清洁卫生、保护和增加森林面积等方面，我们是应该向兄弟国家学习的。
    （4）发展和增加生产
    不断的提高人民的物质和文化生活，我们需要大大地发展和增加工农业的生产，兄弟国家是采取各种的方法来鼓励工农业增产，例如在苏联乌兹别克共和国，这几年来在种棉是获得很大的成就，七十五万农民用一百四十万公顷的土地在1956年生产二百八十六万吨籽棉（等于二千多万担皮棉）。我们访问一个集体农庄是主要种棉花的，95％的种棉到收割工作是机械化的，以前种棉每公顷生产十二公担籽棉，现在一般已提高到二十四公担，这个农庄是向国家保证每公顷生产三十五公担籽棉，而生产结果达到每公顷四十一公担籽棉，国家收购籽棉价格是这样的，每公顷——二十四公担按三点四零卢布收购一公斤，每公顷生产二十五—三十五公担部分的籽棉收购价增加50％，每公顷生产三十五公担以上的籽棉收购价增加百分之一百。捷克斯洛伐克也是采取各种的鼓励方法来推动农民增产的积极性。捷克斯洛伐克农业的单位产量是比较高的，小麦每亩产量达到五百市斤。我国农业的单位产量是需要大大地提高的，而兄弟国家对农业所用各种方法和措施的先进经验是值得我们参考和学习的。
    （5）发电量的增加，电费的降低
    一个国家发电量的多少和电费的高低是决定这个国家工业化和人民生活现代化的重要因素，而要发展一个国家的电业，就必须大力发展水力发电，从而得到廉价的电力，这和提高人民生活是密切相关的。苏联由于水电事业特别发达，1956年发电量高达一千九百二十亿度，故电费特廉（在苏联一个产业工人的每月工资可以购四千度家庭用电，罗马尼亚是一千度，保加利亚是一千五百度，而在中国是二百多度）。在苏联会见他们负责同志的时候，我曾问他谈起发展水电和降低电价提高人民生活的关系问题，他们说：“苏联还要继续大量发展水电事业，来不断降低电价”。回头看看我们中国，第一个五年计划完成以后，每年还只有一百八十亿度电，目前我国电价是比较高的，我们必须努力迎头赶上去。
    （6）关于机关工厂大礼堂的问题
    我们在兄弟国家也曾参加工厂的群众大会，这种大会不是在大礼堂开的（多数工厂是没有的）而是在工厂里的车间开的。我们中国，各机关和各工厂有大礼堂的也不少，在房屋不够用、建筑材料不足、建设资金不是很多的时候，我们是否可以检查和研究现在各机关和各工厂大礼堂的情况。
    （7）出国留学生和研究生问题
    我们在各兄弟国家都看见我们的中国留学生和研究生，他们是很用功、很努力而成绩是比较好的。为了进一步收到更大的成绩，学习更多的科学技术和社会主义经营管理方法，可否考虑选派学生留学的时候要他们在国内参加一至两年的实制工作（与他们出国留学有关的科目）然后出国，因为有这样的工作经验，他们吸收和学习兄弟国家的先进经验的时候，成绩是可能更好的。同时我建议今后多派研究生出国留学，因为估计他们的成绩可能是更快和更大。
    （8）提高效率节约时间
    陈云副总理的报告关于增产节约对于我们每个人都是应该特别重视和贯彻执行的。我认为节约时间也是很重要的。几年来我们对于节约时间是否有足够的注意？开会是否有的过多或过长？在兄弟国家开会的时间不是很长的。我希望今后各方面能考虑充分和合理利用每个人的时间，提高效能，节约时间，使每个人能更好地、更多地贡献最大的努力来为社会主义建设服务。
    以上的几点体会和意见可能是不正确的，请各位委员、各位同志指正。
