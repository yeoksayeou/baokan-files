    The facts are not so
    There are some people who do not have a correct understanding of commercial work. They say that commercial work is a job with no "future," and believe that "commerce" is just about using an abacus and standing behind a counter, and that it has little effect on the socialist construction cause. If we follow these people's ideas, naturally no one would be willing to do "commercial" work. However, the facts are not so.
    Last year, more than 2,200 young men and women in Shanghai took up commercial work positions. They regarded commercial work as their own cause and delved into their work. Now, the vast majority have mastered their jobs and become "experts."
    The forty young people assigned to the First Store of the Pharmaceutical Company have not only learned how to receive customers, but also become familiar with the properties of various medicines. Now they can stand beside the complex pharmaceutical goods and act as "consultants" for customers.
    In the Wing On Company, the nearly two hundred newly arrived young people are very enthusiastic in learning their jobs. Most of them have actively signed "mutual assistance contracts" with experienced veteran shop assistants. Yu Yule of the cotton cloth group not only carefully observed the working methods of the veteran shop assistants at the counter, but also went to nearby state-owned stores to visit and learn after work. One day, a worker came to buy 1.8 zhang of cloth to make a Zhongshan suit. Yu Yule took one look at his figure and told him that 1.6 zhang would be enough, which was immediately praised by the customer. Liang Xiufang in the toy group also asked the staff in the factory for knowledge about the goods, learned the skills, and then explained the performance and maintenance methods of the goods to consumers. This is because they recognize that: commerce is an important link connecting production and consumption. If commercial work is not done well, it will affect the people's lives and the country's production. Those who regard commercial work as having no "future" are merely a reflection of the bourgeoisie's contempt for labor, and not understanding the issue from the perspective of the interests of the country and the people.

    事实并不如此
    有这样一些人，他们对商业工作没有正确的认识，说商业工作是一项没有“出息”的工作，认为“商业”就是打算盘、站柜台，对社会主义建设事业的作用不大。如果按这些人的想法，“商业”工作自然是没人肯干了。可是，事实并不如此。
    去年，上海市有二千二百多个青年男女走上了商业工作岗位，他们把商业工作看作自己的切身事业，钻研业务，现在绝大部分人已经掌握业务，成为“内行人”了。
    分配在医药公司第一商店的四十个青年，他们不但学会了怎样接待顾客，而且摸熟了各种药品的性能，现在都能站在复杂的医药商品旁边，为顾客作“参谋”。
    在永安公司里，新进去的近二百个青年，他们学习业务的劲头很足，大都主动地和有业务经验的老店员签订了“互助合同”。棉布组的俞誉乐不但时时细心注意同柜台老店员的工作方法，下班后还到附近国营商店去参观学习。有一天，有一个工人来买一丈八尺布做套中山装，俞誉乐一打量他的身材，告诉他只要一丈六尺够了，当时就受到顾客的赞扬。玩具小组里的梁秀芳，她还向工厂里的工作人员讨教商品的知识，学得了本领，再向消费者解释商品的性能和保管方法。这是因为他们认识到：商业是联系生产和消费的重要的环节，商业工作做不好，就会影响到人民的生活和国家的生产。那些把商业工作看作是没有“出息”的人，不过是资产阶级轻视劳动的思想的一种反映，而不是从国家和人民利益来认识问题的。
