　　Seedlings Need Dew, Youth Need Education

    In the past few years, under the education of the Party, our ideological awareness has greatly improved, and the ideological mainstream is healthy. However, this does not mean that our thinking is without problems. It should be seen that there are still unhealthy elements in the minds of some of our classmates. For example, when others are sleeping, some students sing loudly, regardless of affecting others' rest. When the class wants to carry out a necessary activity, some students do not participate. Some students, in order to go into the room to get their books, find that the door is locked, but instead of finding the key to unlock it, they break the glass in the doors and windows. Some students take a few bites of a steamed bun and throw it away. These all show that some of our students still have very low political and ideological awareness and very poor communist moral cultivation; they do not understand the relationship between "discipline and freedom," "democracy and centralism," and "collective and individual." These situations also show that although our school has carried out a series of works and conducted ideological education for us in the past, it has not been done enough.
    Now, we are delighted to see that the Party, the government, and the school are taking measures to strengthen our ideological and political education. We need proletarian ideological education, just as seedlings cannot live without the nourishment of sunshine and rain. We hope that through regular communist education, we can strengthen our proletarian ideological consciousness, overcome the influence of bourgeois ideology, and cultivate ourselves into talented personnel needed by the motherland.

　　禾苗需要雨露  青年需要教育
　　山东师范学院学生  吕明灼
    几年来，我们在党的教育下，思想觉悟有了很大的提高，思想主流是健康的。可是，这并不等于说我们思想就没有毛病了。应当看到，在我们一些同学的思想上还有不健康的因素。例如，别人睡觉时，有的同学就破嗓高唱，影响了别人的休息也不管。班上要开展一个必要的活动，有的同学就不参加。有的同学为了进屋拿自己的书，屋门锁着，不去找钥匙开锁，却把门窗上的玻璃打破。有的同学，一个馒头吃了几口，就扔掉了。这些都说明我们有些同学政治思想觉悟还很低，共产主义道德修养还很差；对“纪律与自由”、“民主与集中”、“集体与个人”的关系搞不清楚。这些情况也说明，我们学校过去虽然进行了一系列的工作，对我们进行了思想教育，但是做得还很不够。
    现在，我们欣喜地看到，党、政府和学校正在采取措施加强对我们的思想政治教育。我们需要无产阶级思想教育，就像禾苗离不了阳光雨露的滋养一样。我们希望通过经常接受共产主义教育，加强我们的无产阶级的思想意识，克服资产阶级思想影响，把自己培养成祖国需要的德才兼备的建设人材。
