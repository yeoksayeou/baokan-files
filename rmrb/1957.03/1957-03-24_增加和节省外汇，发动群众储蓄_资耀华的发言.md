Increasing and saving foreign exchange and launching a mass savings campaign.
　　
1956 was a year in which China's socialist revolution achieved a decisive victory, a year in which China's national economy developed greatly and rapidly, and also a year in which the purchasing power of the whole society increased significantly. This means that, on the one hand, all kinds of production have increased greatly, and on the other hand, people's lives have improved considerably. However, in general, production still cannot keep up with the general increase in consumption and needs. Therefore, state reserves and the inventory of commercial departments were used to offset this, and the inventory of materials and turnover decreased accordingly, resulting in a shortage of supply of some means of production and consumer goods. This was originally a deficiency in the process of socialist construction, a difficulty in development, and a specific reflection of the main contradiction in our country's current economic life. This contradiction cannot be fundamentally resolved in the short term, and even if it is temporarily resolved, it may still appear in the future. To solve this contradiction between supply and demand, in the long term, we must constantly increase production on the one hand and comprehensively practice thrift on the other hand. Therefore, I fully support Vice Premier Chen Yun's call: "Request governments, armies, factories, enterprises, schools, and institutions to formulate plans for increasing production and practicing economy according to the specific conditions of each unit, and vigorously carry out a national campaign to increase production and practice economy." At the same time, I was inspired and would like to put forward two very immature suggestions for the reference of all relevant parties.
　　
(1) In increasing production and practicing economy, we must vigorously increase and save foreign exchange funds. For a country that is undergoing massive construction and emerging industrialization, it is inevitable that the raw materials for many prior industries (mostly heavy industries) need to be imported from abroad. Although China has the brotherly support of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, it cannot be without compensation. Not to mention imports from capitalist countries, it is even more necessary to have sufficient export goods and foreign exchange funds to offset them. Thus, to increase foreign exchange funds, we must properly arrange import and export trade. And a country's import and export trade can be divided into four types, namely tangible imports, tangible exports, intangible imports, and intangible exports. What are tangible imports? That is, various goods and commodities are actually imported from foreign countries. What are tangible exports? That is, various goods and commodities are actually exported to foreign countries. Both of these must pass through customs.
　　
What are intangible imports? That is, there are no actual imports of materials and commodities, but foreign exchange funds must be paid, such as the expenses of embassies abroad, the expenses for domestic people to go abroad for inspections and apprenticeships, the expenses for people's organizations to go abroad for inspections and tours, and the expenses for foreign students. What are intangible exports? That is, there are no actual exports of materials and commodities, but the country can receive foreign exchange funds. For example, the expenses of foreign embassies in China, remittances from overseas Chinese, and the expenses of foreign people's organizations visiting and inspecting China. These do not need to pass through customs.
　　
Imports of course require the expenditure of foreign exchange funds, and exports of course can generate foreign exchange funds. If exports exceed imports, forming a trade surplus, foreign exchange funds can increase. If imports exceed exports, forming a trade deficit, foreign exchange funds will decrease.
　　
Therefore, in order to increase and save foreign exchange funds, it is necessary to appropriately maintain tangible imports, reasonably increase tangible exports, strictly limit intangible imports, and vigorously encourage intangible exports. Only in this way can we both increase foreign exchange funds and save foreign exchange funds. If unnecessary intangible imports are too many, they will affect necessary tangible imports, which will hinder the completion of prior industries, and even hinder the development of existing industries (there are such situations in some places now), which has a significant impact on the country's industrialization.
　　
(2) In increasing production and practicing economy, we must vigorously promote reducing consumption and call on people to participate in savings. It goes without saying that the ultimate goal of the socialist revolution is to eliminate exploitation, eliminate poverty, and build a new life of happiness for everyone. To achieve this goal, we must implement socialist industrialization. To implement socialist industrialization, we must accumulate huge amounts of construction funds. To accumulate huge amounts of construction funds, we must of course increase production and accumulate funds on the one hand, and practice thrift and reduce consumption on the other hand. Vice Premier Chen Yun has already pointed out the methods of saving in agriculture, all industries, central departments, all transportation industries, commercial departments, government departments, military organs, factories and enterprises, all schools and institutions, which are very correct and important. In particular, launching a movement to promote thrift and implement savings among the people of the whole country can both accumulate construction funds, alleviate the temporary difficulties in the supply of materials, and increase exports and accumulate foreign exchange funds. Because China has a large population and a large consumption, saving a little more per person per year is a huge number, and consuming a little more per person per year is also a terrible number. If the national average savings is increased by one yuan per person, the total will be more than 600 million yuan, which can be used to purchase more than 3,000 two-thousand-horsepower locomotives, can be used to build seventeen or eighteen spinning mills with 90,000 spindles, can build 1,000 comprehensive hospitals with 100 beds, more than 3,000 ordinary middle schools with 900 students, and more than 10,000 elementary schools with 600 students. This will greatly help meet the material and cultural needs of the people.
　　
Vice Premier Chen Yun also proposed to reduce the export volume of pork by two-thirds in 1957 compared with 1956 to meet the people's need for meat. The result will of course reduce foreign exchange funds. Thus, if the people of the whole country can reduce meat consumption, they can increase foreign exchange funds. For example, if the national pork-eating population is estimated at about 450 million people (a portion of whom do not eat pork), if each person saves only four taels of pork per year, it can save 112.5 million jin, equivalent to 56,250 tons. If used for export, it can be exchanged for 281,250 tons of steel, which can be used to build forty railways equal to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, and can be used to manufacture 187,500 tractors.
　　
From this, it can be seen that the actions of all the people in a populous country are of great importance. If everyone can participate in savings, then accumulating sand into a tower and gathering fur into a robe will benefit oneself and contribute to the country. Why not do it? Therefore, it is suggested that the State Council and the national party and government leaders vigorously call on, hope that national people's organizations will unanimously promote, and even more hope that the members of the National People's Political Consultative Conference at all levels will attach importance to and support this, so as to launch a universal movement to reduce consumption and implement savings among the people of the whole country. This will not only overcome the temporary difficulties in the supply of materials in 1957, but also accumulate huge funds for socialist industrialization. It will not only help to overfulfill the first five-year plan, but also help to smoothly realize the second five-year plan.
　　
The above are purely humble opinions, please criticize and correct them. (With picture)

    增加和节省外汇，发动群众储蓄
　　资耀华的发言
    1956年是我国社会主义革命取得了决定性胜利的一年，是我国国民经济发展很大而且很快的一年，同时也是全国社会购买力有很大增长的一年。这就是一方面各种生产大大地增加了，一方面人民生活相当地改善了，但总的来说，生产还是赶不上消费和需要的普遍增加，因此用了国家储备和商业部门的库存物资来抵付，物资库存和周转量就相应地减少，从而就出现了一些生产资料和消费资料的供应紧张的现象。这原是在社会主义建设过程上前进中的不足，发展中的困难，也就是我们国家目前主要矛盾在经济生活中的具体反映。这个矛盾在短时期内还不能从根本上解决，即使暂时解决了，今后某个时期还可能出现，要解决这种供求之间的矛盾，今后只有在长期内经常地，一方面大力增加生产，一方面全面厉行节约。所以我完全拥护陈云副总理的号召：“要求政府、军队、工厂、企业、学校、事业单位，根据各个单位的情况，作出增产节约的方案，有力地开展全国增产节约运动。”同时我得到启发，愿意提出两点极不成熟的建议，供各有关方面的参考。
      （一）在增产节约中，要大力增加和节省外汇资金。凡是一个进行巨大建设，新兴工业化的国家，有许多先行工业（多半是重工业）的原材料，要从国外进口，这是必然的。我国虽然有苏联及东欧国家兄弟般的支援，也不可是无偿的。若对资本主义国家的进口，不容说，更必需有足够的出口物资和外汇资金去抵付。从而可知，要增加外汇资金，就要很好地安排进出口贸易。而一个国家的进出口贸易，又可分为四种，即有形的进口，有形的出口，无形的进口，无形的出口。什么是有形的进口呢？就是从外国实际输入各种货物商品。什么是有形的出口呢？就是向外国实际输出各种货物商品，这两种都是要通过海关的。
    什么是无形的进口呢？就是并没有实际的物资和商品进口，但要支付外汇资金，例如在外使馆经费，本国人民出国考察见习费用，人民团体出国视察游历费用，留学生费用等。什么是无形的出口呢？就是并没有实际的物资和商品出口，但国家可以收入外汇资金。例如外国使馆在我国的经费，华侨汇款，外国人民团体来我国旅行视察等费用。这是不要通过海关的。
    进口当然要支出外汇资金，出口当然可以收入外汇资金。出口多于进口，形成贸易出超，外汇资金就可以增加。进口多于出口，形成贸易入超，外汇资金就要减少。
    所以为了增加和节省外汇资金，就必需适当地维持有形的进口，合理地增加有形的出口，严格地限制无形的进口，大力地鼓励无形的出口。要如此才可以一方既增加外汇资金，一方又节省外汇资金。假使不必需的无形的进口太多，就要影响必需的有形的进口，就会妨碍先行工业的建成，甚至要阻碍已有工业的发展（现在有些地方就有这种情况），对于国家工业化是有重大关系的。
      （二）在增产节约中要大力提倡减少消费，号召参加储蓄。不容说，社会主义革命的最终目的，就是要消灭剥削，消灭贫困，建设一个人人幸福的新生活。要达到这个目的，就要实行社会主义工业化，要实行社会主义工业化，就要积累巨额的建设资金，要积累巨额的建设资金，当然就要一方面增加生产，蓄积资金，一方面更要厉行节约，减少消费。陈云副总理已经指出在农业、一切工业、中央各部门、一切运输业、商业部门、政府部门、军事机关、工厂企业、一切学校和事业单位的节约方法，是非常正确而重要的。尤其是在全国人民中间，掀起一个提倡节约实行储蓄的运动，则一方既可以蓄积建设资金，一方也可以缓和物资供应紧张的暂时困难，同时还可以增加出口而蓄积外汇资金。因为我国人口众多，消费量大，每人每年多节省一点，是一个庞大的数目，每人每年多消费一点，也是一个可怕的数目。假使全国每人平均多储蓄一元，总数就是六亿多元，就可用以购买三千多个两千马力的火车头，就可用以建设十七八个九万纱锭的纺纱厂，就可建设一百个病床的综合医院一千所，建设收容九百名学生的普通中学三千多所，建设收容六百名学生的小学校一万多所。这对于满足人民物质需要和文化需要上就有很大的帮助。
    陈云副总理还提出1957年度比1956年度预备减少猪肉出口量的三分之二，来满足人民的肉食需要，结果当然要减少外汇资金，从而可知全国人民若能减少肉食消费，就可以增加外汇资金。即如全国食猪肉人口大约以四万五千万人计算（一部分不食猪肉），每人每年只要节省四两猪肉，就可省出一亿一千二百五十万斤，合五万六千二百五十吨，如用以出口，可以换回二十八万一千二百五十吨钢材，可用以筑成和成渝铁路相等的铁路四十条，可用以制造十八万七千五百部拖拉机。
    由此可见，人口众多的国家，全体人民的一举一动，关系重大。若能人人参加储蓄，则聚沙成塔，集腋成裘，利在自己，功在国家，何乐而不为呢？因此建议国务院及全国党政领导大力号召，希望全国人民团体一致提倡，更希望全国各级政协委员重视支持，从而在全国范围内，在全国人民中间，掀起一个普遍的减少消费实行储蓄的运动，则不但可以克服1957年物资供应紧张的暂时困难，更可以蓄积社会主义工业化的巨额资金。不但可以有助于第一个五年计划的超额完成，也可以有助于第二个五年计划的顺利实现。
    以上纯系蒭荛之见，请各位委员批评指正。（附图片）
