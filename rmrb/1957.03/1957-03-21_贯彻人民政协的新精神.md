The Third Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) has concluded. Prior to this meeting, all CPPCC members attended the Supreme State Conference and listened to Chairman Mao's speech on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." The meeting heard Premier Zhou Enlai's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC," and special speeches on important issues such as increasing production and practicing economy, and political and legal work. It also adopted a political resolution, a resolution on increasing production and practicing economy, and a resolution on the work report of the Standing Committee. In addition, at the preparatory meeting for this session, everyone listened to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy. These are all important issues in our country's current work.

During the meeting, the members, in the spirit of "saying all you know and saying it without reservation," extensively discussed all aspects of our country's work. The entire meeting affirmed the achievements in our country's work, strictly criticized the shortcomings in the work, actively put forward opinions for improving the work, and put forward 287 proposals. This reflects the expansion of our country's democratic life. We should implement the new spirit of this CPPCC meeting into all regions and all work, and further develop our country's socialist cause.

Currently, the people of our country are extensively carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy in order to build socialism. In the past few years, each movement to increase production and practice economy has achieved significant results. This year is the last year of the First Five-Year Plan, and the movement to increase production and practice economy has its own special significance. Vice Premier Chen Yun made a systematic explanation of the ways, methods, and matters that should be paid attention to in this year's movement to increase production and practice economy in his special speech. Building the country through diligence and thrift is our general policy in the cause of socialist construction. Diligence means increasing production; thrift means increasing economy. We are a large country with a population of 600 million. If everyone produces a little more and saves a little more, it will be a very, very large number. If we do this conscientiously, we will smoothly overcome some temporary difficulties in the current economic life, promote the advancement of national construction, and improve the people's living standards more quickly. This CPPCC meeting focused on discussing this issue and passed a resolution on increasing production and practicing economy, hoping that the people of the whole country will respond to this call with practical actions.

This meeting also discussed the issue of eliminating counter-revolutionaries. In the past year or more, we have followed the policy of "raising vigilance, eliminating all special agents; preventing deviations, and not wrongly accusing a single good person," and have achieved great success in the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries. Thanks to the efforts of the people of the whole country in the past few years, we have basically eliminated the remaining counter-revolutionary forces, thereby guaranteeing the victory of the socialist transformation and the development of socialist construction. Our policy of eliminating counter-revolutionaries is correct, and the victory we have achieved is great. Although some deviations have occurred in the work, it should be affirmed that the movement is generally healthy and the achievements are the main thing. Adopting the mass line in eliminating counter-revolutionaries is conducive to distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves, and also to educating the masses. Now the number of remaining counter-revolutionaries is no longer large, but they still exist, and they will still use various opportunities to carry out sabotage activities. Therefore, we must continue to maintain a high degree of vigilance and continue to carry out the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries. Errors in the work of eliminating counter-revolutionaries must also be corrected in a spirit of seeking truth from facts. The CPPCC meeting unanimously agreed to the principle of "must eliminate if there are counter-revolutionaries, and must correct if there are mistakes." This will definitely have a beneficial impact on the correct conduct of the work of eliminating counter-revolutionaries in the future.

Rural work was also fully discussed at this meeting. Last year was a year of upsurge in the socialist transformation of our country's countryside. In this year, agricultural cooperativization was basically completed, and more than 90% of farmers joined advanced agricultural production cooperatives. It was precisely under these circumstances that we overcame disasters, increased production, and enabled the vast majority of farmers to increase their income to varying degrees. However, everything new must go through many difficulties and struggles in the process of its development, and it is impossible to reach a perfect state in one step. The issue of agricultural cooperativization is also like this. Because its development history is still very short, and cadres and the masses generally lack experience, it is naturally inevitable that some shortcomings and errors will occur. These shortcomings and errors are obviously secondary compared to the great achievements already made by agricultural cooperativization in the first year. Therefore, for agricultural cooperativization, we should first affirm its great achievements, summarize its successful experiences, and at the same time appropriately point out and overcome the shortcomings in the work in various places, in order to unite and work together to strive for a bumper harvest this year. At this CPPCC meeting, everyone comprehensively analyzed the problems in agricultural cooperativization, basically unified their understanding, and put forward many specific methods for improving the work. This is of great significance for the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives and the development of agricultural production.

Many other issues were also raised and discussed at this CPPCC meeting. From the entire discussion process of the meeting, it can be seen that because the meeting included representatives from all aspects, and problems were raised from various different angles, this greatly helped the people of our country to obtain a more comprehensive estimate of the achievements and shortcomings of the country's work, and helped our country's socialist construction cause to advance more smoothly.

Facts over the past few years have proven that with the development of the socialist cause, the role of the CPPCC is becoming increasingly significant. Last year, the Chinese Communist Party put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" with various democratic parties. This policy was warmly supported by the democratic parties and became an important principle in our country's political life. The CPPCC is a united front organization jointly composed of various democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic人士 from all walks of life. It will exist for a long time along with the long-term coexistence of the democratic parties; at the same time, it is also one of the main forms of mutual supervision of our country's work. The resolution on the work report of the Standing Committee passed at this meeting stipulates that the National Committee of the CPPCC and local committees at all levels should further strengthen consultation on various opinions, give play to the role of mutual supervision, organize learning, strengthen the guiding relationship of the National Committee to local committees, and improve working bodies and working systems in the future. There is no doubt that in our country's political life, organizational forms like the CPPCC are not only needed now, but will still be needed in the future. This CPPCC meeting newly added more than 70 members representing various aspects, and also re-elected new members of the Standing Committee. These are all clear proofs that the CPPCC meeting is being strengthened day by day. Now that the meeting has closed, all members must return to their daily work posts. We hope that they will closely contact the masses in all aspects and comprehensively reflect all aspects of our country's work, so as to promptly promote achievements, overcome shortcomings, and help the great motherland advance rapidly and steadily on the socialist road.

The current international situation is favorable to our country's socialist construction. At this meeting, a detailed and profound analysis of the international situation was made in Premier Zhou Enlai's report and the political resolution. The current international situation is basically still trending towards relaxation and progress. Although imperialism is constantly creating tension and attempting to take the opportunity to expand, this tactic has not intimidated anyone. The forces of peace are constantly growing, and the forces of war are becoming increasingly isolated. As long as socialist countries, nationalist countries, and all peace-loving countries and peoples strengthen unity and persist in struggle, lasting world peace can surely be achieved.

### 贯彻人民政协的新精神

    贯彻人民政协的新精神
    中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第三次会议已经闭幕。在这次会议以前，全体政协委员列席了最高国务会议，听了毛主席“正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话。会议听取了周恩来总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告，陈叔通副主席关于“中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告”，还听取了关于增产节约、政法工作等许多重要问题的专题发言；通过了政治决议、关于增产节约问题的决议和关于常务委员会工作报告的决议。此外，在这次会议的预备会议上，大家还听取了李富春副总理关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议的说明。这些都是目前我们国家工作中的一些重要问题。
    在会议中，委员们本着“知无不言，言无不尽”的精神，广泛地讨论了我们国家各个方面的工作。整个会议肯定了我们国家工作中的成绩，严格地批评了工作中的缺点，积极地提出了改进工作的意见，并且提出了二百八十七件提案。这反映了我们国家民主生活的扩大。我们应该把这一次人民政协会议的新精神贯彻到各个地区各项工作中去，进一步发展我国的社会主义事业。
    目前我国人民为了建设社会主义，正在广泛地开展增产节约运动。过去几年中，每一次增产节约运动都获得了显著的效果。今年是第一个五年计划的最后一年，增产节约运动更有它的特殊意义。今年的增产节约的途径、方法和应注意的事项，陈云副总理在专题发言中做了有系统的说明。勤俭建国是我们在社会主义建设事业中的总方针。勤，就是多增产；俭，就是多节约。我们是个六亿人口的大国，每个人多生产一点，多节约一点，就是一个很大很大的数目。我们认真地这样做，就会顺利地克服目前经济生活中的一些暂时性的困难，推动国家建设事业的前进，也就会较快地提高人民生活的水平。这次政协会议着重地讨论了这个问题，并且通过了关于增产节约的决议，希望全国人民以实际行动来响应这个号召。
    这次会议也讨论了关于肃清反革命分子的问题。过去一年多以来，我们遵照“提高警惕，肃清一切特务分子；防止偏差，不要冤枉一个好人”的方针，在肃反斗争中获得了巨大的成就。由于过去几年全国人民的努力，我们已经基本上肃清了反革命残余势力，从而保障了社会主义改造事业的胜利和社会主义建设事业的发展。我们的肃反政策是正确的，所得的胜利是伟大的。虽然在工作中发生过若干偏差，但是应该肯定，运动一般是健康的，成绩是主要的。采取群众路线进行肃反，既便于分清敌我，又便于教育群众。现在残余的反革命分子为数已经不多，但是他们还存在着，他们还会利用各种机会进行破坏活动。所以，我们必须继续保持高度的警惕，继续进行肃反斗争。在肃反工作中的错误，也必须采取实事求是的精神加以纠正。人民政协会议一致同意了“有反必肃，有错必纠”的原则。这对于今后肃反工作的正确进行，一定会产生有利的影响。
    农村工作问题在这次会议中也作了充分讨论。去年是我国农村社会主义改造高潮的一年。这一年中，基本上完成了农业合作化，占90％以上的农户加入了高级农业生产合作社。正是在这种情况下，我们才战胜了灾害，增加了生产，使得绝大多数的农民都在不同的程度上增加了收入。但是，一切新生的事物在它发展的过程中，总要经过许多困难和斗争，不可能一步登天地达到完美的境地。农业合作化问题也是这样。因为它的发展历史还很短，干部和群众一般地缺乏经验，自然难免发生一些缺点和错误。这些缺点、错误跟农业合作化在第一年就已经取得的巨大成就比较起来，显然是次要的。因此，对于农业合作化，我们首先应该肯定它的伟大成绩，总结它的成功经验，同时又要恰当地指出和克服各地工作中的缺点，以便团结一致，共同为争取今年的大丰收而努力。这次政协会议，大家全面地分析了农业合作化中的问题，基本上统一了认识，提出了许多改进工作的具体办法。这对于农业合作社的巩固和农业生产的发展，都有重要的意义。
    在这次政协会议上，还提出和讨论了许多其他的问题。从整个会议的讨论过程可以看出，由于会议包括了各方面的代表人物，从各个不同的角度上提出了问题，这就大大帮助了我国人民对于国家工作的成就和缺点得到比较全面的估计，帮助了我国的社会主义建设事业更加顺利地前进。
    几年来的事实证明，随着社会主义事业的发展，人民政治协商会议的作用日益显著。去年，中国共产党提出了同各民主党派“长期共存，互相监督”的方针。这个方针获得了各民主党派的热烈拥护，成为我们国家政治生活中一个重要原则。人民政治协商会议是由各民主党派、各人民团体和各界民主人士共同组成的统一战线的机构，它将随着各民主党派的长期共存而长期存在；同时，它也是对我们国家工作进行互相监督的主要形式之一。这次会议通过的关于常务委员会工作报告的决议中，规定了政协的全国委员会和各级地方委员会，今后要进一步加强对各项意见的协商，发挥互相监督的作用，组织学习，加强全国委员会对地方委员会的指导关系，健全工作机构和工作制度。毫无疑义，在我们国家政治生活中，像政治协商会议这样的组织形式，不仅现在需要，将来也仍然需要。这次政治协商会议新增加了代表各个方面的七十多位委员，并且增选了新的常务委员。这些，都是政协会议正在日益加强的明证。现在，会议闭幕了，各个委员都要回到他们日常的工作岗位上去，我们希望他们密切地联系各方面的群众，全面地反映我们国家各方面的工作，以便及时地发扬成绩，克服缺点，帮助伟大的祖国在社会主义道路上迅速地而又稳步地前进。
    目前的国际形势对于我国的社会主义建设是有利的。在这次会议上，在周恩来总理的报告和政治决议中，对于国际形势作了详尽而深刻的分析。目前国际形势基本上仍然是在趋向缓和，趋向进步。虽然，帝国主义不断地制造紧张局势，企图借机进行扩张，但是，这种手法没有吓倒任何人。和平的力量正在不断壮大，战争的势力已经越来越加孤立。只要社会主义国家、民族主义国家和一切爱好和平的国家和人民加强团结，坚持斗争，世界的持久和平就一定可以取得。
