Thanking the Soviet Union for its selfless assistance
——Written for the gratuitous handover of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital to China
Li Dequan, Minister of Public Health of the People's Republic of China and President of the Red Cross Society of China

Five years ago, at the initiative of the Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union, the Red Cross societies of China and the Soviet Union, based on the principles of internationalism and revolutionary humanitarianism, jointly established the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital.

From the very first day of its establishment, the hospital assumed the task of disseminating advanced Soviet medical ideas and technologies. Over the past five years, 126 Soviet medical experts and other medical personnel have come to work at the hospital. They led Chinese medical workers in treating hundreds of thousands of patients and curing many difficult and complex diseases. Soviet medical experts, through their concrete practice, disseminated Pavlov's dialectical materialist medical thought in our country. They often taught Chinese doctors that the human body is an organic whole, and it is the doctor's responsibility to preserve the integrity of the human body and maintain the normal functioning of the body. Under the guidance of these new medical ideas, the causes of many chronic and difficult diseases were found, and patients recovered their health after treatment. For example, a patient named Li Zhongli suffered from sciatica for a long time without finding the cause. Under the guidance of experts, a thorough examination of the whole body was conducted, and it was found that the left side of the buttocks was higher than the right, and there was a tumor on the femur. After excision, the patient quickly recovered. Another example is a student of midwifery school who suffered a disease due to stimulation. She would convulse when she heard sounds, encountered strong light, or met strangers. After the experts carefully investigated her condition before the onset of the disease and analyzed her living environment, they tried to fundamentally eliminate her terror, and she gradually returned to normal. There are many similar moving examples. Moreover, over the past five years, Soviet experts at the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital have also proved the greatness of Pavlov's theory with their practical actions, introduced Soviet medical experience to us, and encouraged the establishment and development of correct and new medical ideas in our medical circles. This is of great significance to the development of medical science in our country in the future.

The Soviet experts at the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital selflessly passed on their technology to Chinese medical workers, and helped Chinese medical workers to train and improve in practical work. Under the enthusiastic guidance of Soviet experts, the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital has consistently adhered to the system of weekly technical research meetings for the past five years, helping Chinese doctors improve their medical theoretical level and enrich their clinical experience. For example, the neurology department often holds case discussions, allowing Chinese doctors to report cases at the meeting, and experts often raise enlightening questions to cultivate the independent thinking ability of Chinese doctors; for every surgery performed by the surgery department, the experts always lead the Chinese doctors to discuss the diagnosis in detail beforehand, and first perform several demonstration operations, asking Chinese doctors to act as first assistants and second assistants, and then the Chinese doctors preside over the operation, with Soviet experts as assistants; Soviet experts also helped Chinese doctors to carry out scientific research work and write scientific reports, not only helping Chinese doctors to choose topics, but also helping to revise them. Thanks to the enthusiastic and specific help of Soviet experts, many Chinese medical workers in the hospital have made significant progress. This year, some young Chinese doctors have been able to perform surgeries such as mitral valve separation. In 1956, young Chinese doctors also wrote seventy-nine scientific research papers. Chinese medical workers who came to the hospital for further studies also received selfless help from Soviet experts. The 246 doctors who studied at the hospital have played a key role after returning to their original posts. Experts are also often invited to various hospitals for consultations and guidance. These activities have a good impact on our medical circles. The methods used by Soviet experts to train and help Chinese medical workers are diverse, and their attitude is patient and tireless. We deeply know that all this is to help the development of medical science in our country, and to alleviate and eliminate the suffering of patients. Under their selfless help and earnest guidance, a group of young Chinese doctors has grown up.

The Soviet experts and medical staff of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital worked selflessly, with "everything for the patient" in mind, treating patients with the feelings of friends and brothers, and always keeping patients happy. This noble medical ethics and style of being responsible to people has left a deep impression on our medical workers and set a glorious example.

Because the Chinese and Soviet workers of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital have served patients wholeheartedly for five years, the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital enjoys a high reputation among the Chinese people. In our country's major newspapers and periodicals, we can often see articles or "letters from readers" thanking the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital. Many patients have personally experienced the greatness of internationalism and the profound brotherly friendship between China and the Soviet Union.

Soviet experts and medical workers have never neglected learning at any time. They constantly learn new achievements in Chinese medicine, and they humbly learn from our national medical heritage. This spirit of daring to explore the truth has also set a new example for our medical circles and medical workers.

In the short span of five years, the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital has left a deep impression on the Chinese medical circles and the broad masses of the people, and has deepened the profound friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. Based on the agreement of the Chinese and Soviet governments, after the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital is gratuitously handed over to the Chinese government, Soviet experts will return to their country one after another. This is very reluctant, but I believe that the advanced Soviet medical experience they have spread in China will always remain in China. It will become a positive factor for our country to advance towards medical science. I hope and believe that our medical workers will better learn from the medical experience and excellent medical ethics and style of Soviet medical scientists, and serve the health of the working people wholeheartedly. I believe that our medical workers will use new medical achievements to thank the Soviet people, the Soviet government, and the Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union for their sincere and selfless assistance to the Chinese people.

    感谢苏联无私的帮助
    ——为北京苏联红十字医院无偿地移交中国而写
    中华人民共和国卫生部长中国红十字会会长  李德全
    五年前，由于苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会的倡议，中苏两国红十字会根据国际主义和革命人道主义原则，合作创办了北京苏联红十字医院。
    从医院成立的第一天起，它就担负起传播苏联先进医学思想和医疗技术的任务。五年来，有一百二十六名苏联医学专家和其他医务人员来医院工作，他们带领中国医务工作者共同治疗了几十万病人，治好了不少疑难病症。苏联医学专家们以自己的具体实践，在我国传播了巴甫洛夫的辩证唯物主义的医学思想。他们常常教导中国医师说：人体是一个有机的整体，保存人体的完整和保持机体的正常是医师的责任。在这些新的医学思想指导下，许多久治不愈的疑难病症找到了病因，经过治疗，使病人恢复了健康。例如：一个叫李中立的患坐骨神经痛的病，长时期找不出致病的原因，在专家的指导下，作了全身彻底检查，发现臀部左侧比右侧高，在股骨上生有一个毒瘤。经过割治，病人很快恢复了健康。又如一位助产学校的学生，因受刺激发病，听见音响，遇见强光或遇见生人就搐搦。经过专家详细调查了她发病前的情况，分析了她的生活环境，设法从根本上解除了她的恐怖，使她逐渐恢复了正常。类似这样动人的事例还很多。不仅如此，五年来，北京苏联红十字医院的苏联专家们还用他们的实际行动，证实了巴甫洛夫学说的伟大，给我们介绍了苏联的医学经验，鼓舞我国医学界树立和发展正确的、新的医学思想。这对我国今后医学科学的发展具有重大意义。
    北京苏联红十字医院的苏联专家们，赤诚无私地把技术传授给了中国医务工作者，在实际工作中帮助中国医务工作者锻炼、提高。在苏联专家热心的主持下，北京苏联红十字医院五年来一贯坚持了每周一次技术研究会的制度，帮助中国医师提高了医学理论水平，丰富了临床经验。如神经科经常开病例讨论会，让中国医师在会上报告病历，专家经常提出有启发性的问题培养中国医师独立的思考能力；外科每作一个手术，专家事前总是领导中国医师们详细讨论诊断，并先作几例示教，请中国医师先作第一助手，第二助手，然后再由中国医师主持这次手术，苏联专家当助手；苏联专家还帮助中国医师进行科学研究工作，写科学报告，不但帮助中国医师选题，还帮助修改。由于苏联专家热心而具体的帮助，该院许多中国医务工作者获得了显著的进步。今年，一些中国青年医生已经能作心脏二尖瓣分离术等手术。中国青年医师在1956年还写了七十九篇科学研究论文。在这个医院进修的中国医务工作者，同样也得到苏联专家无私的帮助。在该院进修的二百四十六名医师，回到原岗位后，都起了骨干作用。专家们还经常应邀到各医院去会诊和指导工作。这些活动，对我国医学界有良好的影响，苏联专家培养、帮助中国医务工作者的办法是多种多样的，态度是循循善诱、诲人不倦的。我们深知这一切都是为了帮助我国医学科学的发展，都是为了减轻和消除病人的痛苦。在他们无私的帮助和认真的指导下，一批青年中国医师已经成长起来了。
    北京苏联红十字医院的苏联专家和医护人员们忘我的劳动，“一切为了病人”，以对待自己的朋友和兄弟的感情对待病人，永远使病人精神愉快。这种对人负责的高尚的医疗道德和作风，给我国医务工作者留下了深刻的影响，树立了光辉的榜样。
    由于北京苏联红十字医院中苏工作者，五年如一日地全心全意为病人服务，因此，北京苏联红十字医院在中国人民群众中享有很高的威信。在我国的各大报刊上，经常可以看到病人们感谢北京苏联红十字医院的文章或“读者来信”，不少病人从自己的亲身经历中，体会到国际主义精神的伟大、中苏两国兄弟般深厚的友谊。
    苏联专家和医护工作者们，任何时候都没有忽视学习。他们随时学习中国医学的新的成果，他们虚心学习我国民族医学遗产。这种勇于探求真理的学习精神，也为我国医学界和医务工作者树立了新的榜样。
    在短短的五年中，北京苏联红十字医院在中国医学界和广大人民群众中留下了深刻的影响，更加深了中苏两国人民深厚的友谊。基于中苏双方政府的同意，北京苏联红十字医院无偿地移交中国政府后，苏联专家将陆续回国，这是很使人留恋难舍的，但我相信他们在中国传播的苏联先进医学经验将永远留在中国。它将成为我国向医学科学进军的积极因素。我希望并相信我国的医务工作者会更好地学习苏联医学家的医疗经验及优良的医疗道德和作风，全心全意地为劳动人民的健康服务。我相信，我国的医务工作者，会以新的医学成就来感谢苏联人民、苏联政府及苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会对中国人民的赤诚无私的帮助。
