    Nowhere to Deposit Money
    We are conducting exploration work in the Zhongjia area of Longyan County, Fujian Province. This is a sparsely populated deep mountain area, forty *li* of mountain road away from Longyan County, and transportation is very inconvenient. There are no bank savings institutions here, and our team's employees feel they have extra money but nowhere to deposit it. Especially after the wage reform last year, the income of ordinary employees has generally increased. According to statistics, more than 95% of our team's employees are able to participate in savings, with a monthly savings amount of about 3,000 yuan. Although there is a People's Bank branch in Longyan city, it takes a day and a half to travel back and forth. Therefore, no one wants to travel so far, and everyone has to carry the RMB with them or put it in a box, and some people even spend the money randomly. This not only fails to increase construction funds for the country, but also leads to waste for the employees themselves. In order to solve this problem, I suggest that the People's Bank of China can set up small savings institutions in some areas with inconvenient transportation, especially where exploration teams are located, or send people from the bank to handle savings work when we pay wages every month.

    有钱无处存
    我们是在福建省龙岩县中甲地区进行勘探工作的。这里是人烟稀少的深山，距离龙岩县城有四十华里山路，交通很不方便。在这里没有银行的储蓄机构，我们队的职工都感到有多余的钱没有地方去储存。特别是去年工资改革后，一般职工的工资收入都有增加，据统计，我们全队职工能够参加储蓄的要占95％以上，每月储存金额约达三千元。虽然龙岩城里有人民银行支行，但是，往返一次要一天半时间。因此谁也不愿跑这么远去，大家只好把人民币带在身上或放在箱子里，有的人甚至把钱乱花了。这样，不但不能给国家增加建设资金，对职工本人来说，也会形成浪费。为了解决这个问题，我建议中国人民银行能在一些交通不便的地区，特别是勘探队所在地设立小型的储蓄机构，或者在我们每月发工资时银行派人来办理储蓄工作。  王天涛
