　　I wholeheartedly endorse Chairman Mao's wise instructions at the Supreme State Conference on correctly handling contradictions among the people, Premier Zhou's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries, and Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of some issues in the Second Five-Year Plan. I fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the Third Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC. Chairman Mao's instructions and Premier Zhou's report are scientific and insightful Marxist-Leninist expositions on current domestic and international issues, which will guide us in correctly handling all tasks and issues, ensure that we unite all forces that can be united at home and abroad, bring into play all positive factors, and accelerate the completion of the great socialist construction of the motherland. I will definitely make efforts to study these two historically significant documents well, improve my ideological understanding, grasp the spirit of the documents, and implement them in my work.

　　Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has achieved regional autonomy and established a new national relationship of "national equality, close unity, mutual assistance, and common development." In order to get rid of poverty and backwardness and achieve de facto national equality, the people of all ethnic groups are working hard and courageously with great enthusiasm and initiative in various production and construction tasks. Like other parts of the country, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region achieved the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce in 1956. On the basis of changing the relations of production, a new upsurge of production has emerged. Agriculture in 1956 achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, and animal husbandry also made significant developments. At present, the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are carrying out a large-scale production movement throughout the region on the basis of the victory of socialist transformation, making unremitting efforts to strive for a greater harvest in 1957 and to support the country's socialist construction.

　　Now, I would like to make a brief statement here on the issue of health and epidemic prevention work and the prevention and control of brucellosis in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

　　Historically, all reactionary rulers fundamentally did not care about the suffering of the people, and as a result of the oppression and exploitation of reactionary rulers, they left the people with many diseases and hardships. This phenomenon is even more serious in minority areas. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region carried out arduous struggles against various epidemics and hardships, and have achieved great successes so far. The once rampant plague has been controlled, making it impossible for it to occur and spread among people; venereal diseases, which endanger the health of the people of Inner Mongolia, have been stopped from developing through vigorous prevention and control and are being gradually eliminated; and maternal and child health work has also been greatly developed. Now, the population of ethnic minorities in Inner Mongolia has been increasing year by year from the previous decline. At the same time, it has also ensured the smooth flow of international transportation lines and the construction of industrial bases and various production activities.

　　Our health and epidemic prevention work in 1956 was carried out on this basis, and the focus was placed on the struggle to eliminate the epidemic diseases that pose the greatest harm to the people. In the plague prevention and control work, the scope of epidemic source retrieval was expanded, the epidemic source areas were basically identified, and large-scale rodent extermination work was carried out in the field. Statistics from only four leagues and two administrative districts, such as Hulunbuir, completed 45,107 square kilometers of rodent poisoning area. According to key investigations, the average number of rat holes per hectare after rodent poisoning dropped to less than four. A sample survey of six villages in Tongliao City showed that there were only three rat holes per 100 rooms. A survey of ten banners and counties in Zhaowuda League showed 710 rat-free villages, which led to a sharp decline in the density of domestic and wild rats. More than 1.4 million people were also vaccinated with plague vaccine in key areas, three times more than in 1955, which improved the immunity of residents. Therefore, no human epidemic occurred in 1956. However, the occurrence and spread of plague among rats still constantly threatens the health and safety of the people of all ethnic groups in our region. Therefore, we must be vigilant and continue to strengthen the importance of this work. In the prevention and control of venereal diseases, professional venereal disease prevention and control institutions were established in various leagues last year, and vigorous venereal disease prevention and control work was carried out. A total of 200,578 people were screened throughout the year, which is more than the total number of people screened in the entire region in the six years from 1950 to 1955. The screening rate reached more than 85% to 90% of the permanent residents in the area, and 21,245 patients were treated free of charge, which is equivalent to 15 times the total number of people treated in the entire region in the three years from 1953 to 1955. The measles mortality rate decreased by 0.14% compared with 1955, and the number of cases of epidemic hemorrhagic fever decreased by 40% compared with 1955. Research and treatment have also been carried out on other endemic diseases, such as Keshan disease and brucellosis. In terms of maternal and child health, 295 midwives of various ethnic groups and 442 health workers have been trained, and a total of 10,538 old midwives and trained birth attendants have been transformed. Health centers, health stations, delivery stations, and delivery teams have been newly built. Central delivery stations have also been established in agricultural and pastoral areas. A mobile working method that facilitates the masses, especially the pastoral masses, has been promoted. Prenatal and postnatal examinations are conducted for parturients, and new methods of delivery have been widely promoted. The mortality rate of tetanus neonatorum has been greatly reduced, from 53% in 1950 to 1.15%. 1,051 maternal and child health propagandists have been trained, and maternal and child health publicity and education work has been widely carried out, which has been greatly welcomed by farmers and herdsmen. Comprehensive hospitals in various leagues, administrative districts, and cities all have 20% of obstetrics and gynecology beds and 10% of pediatric beds. Health and epidemic prevention and maternal and child health work have played a great role in enhancing the health of the people of all ethnic groups and ensuring the smooth progress of various production and construction activities.

　　Below, I would like to say a few more words about the prevention and control of brucellosis in the Inner Mongolia region:

　　Brucellosis was discovered in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in 1953. Brucellosis is a livestock infectious disease, but it also infects humans. The masses call this disease "paralysis disease" or "poverty disease." If a person is infected with this disease, they will quickly lose their health, become paralyzed, lose their ability to work, and will not be able to engage in production, and will also lose their fertility. The same is true for livestock suffering from this disease. Abortion in female animals is even more serious. This bacterium is easily infected, and anyone who comes into contact with diseased animals may be infected. For example, herders, lambing and nursery personnel, feeding and management personnel, animal husbandry and veterinary staff, and slaughterers may be infected if they come into contact with diseased animals without protective equipment or disinfection. Housewives and cooks are also at risk of infection if they touch bacteria-carrying meat or eat undercooked meat containing bacteria. According to existing survey materials, except for Bayannur League, which has not been surveyed, and Chahar League, which has not been found, brucellosis has occurred and spread in some banners and counties of the other six leagues and two administrative districts. Diseased animals and patients have also been found in Hohhot and Baotou. According to our survey in 44 banners and counties in six leagues and two administrative districts: the positive rate of human serum tests is as high as 20% to 25%; the positive rate of cattle and sheep serum tests is as high as 15% to 20%; and the average abortion rate of cattle and sheep is 20% to 25%. It is estimated that there are about 100,000 brucellosis patients in the entire region, accounting for about 1.17% of the total population of the region. Among them, about 25,000 patients have completely lost their ability to work, which is a very alarming number. If the disease period of each patient, that is, the period of complete inability to engage in production, is one year (due to the limitations of the economic conditions of the masses and our prevention and control technology, it is often not possible to cure and fully recover health within one year), then 9 million workdays are lost each year. If these workdays could be used for agricultural production, they could produce 50 million catties more grain for the country, which could feed 200,000 urban people for a year. It is estimated that there are about 2 million to 3 million sick livestock in the entire region. If half of the sick livestock are fertile female animals, about 200,000 to 300,000 small livestock will be aborted each year. Furthermore, due to the limitations of our prevention and control and other conditions, we are currently unable to control the development and spread of this disease, and the actual loss figures are even greater than the above figures. This is the serious harm that brucellosis brings to the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia. People who suffer from this disease cannot have children, which is even more serious for ethnic minorities.

　　The animal husbandry economy of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region accounts for a considerable proportion of the entire national economy. Pastoral areas are completely engaged in animal husbandry production, and animal husbandry production in semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas accounts for a large part of the entire production. Animal husbandry in agricultural areas also accounts for a considerable proportion. The main sideline production of farmers in the Inner Mongolia region is generally animal husbandry. That is to say, the majority of farmers and herdsmen in Inner Mongolia raise livestock and have to contact livestock. Moreover, in order to increase production and obtain bumper harvests, and to support the country's socialist industrialization, they work hard day and night, supplying a large amount of meat, dairy products, and fur to meet the needs of domestic cities, and exporting them abroad. The people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region wholeheartedly want to build the autonomous region well and join hands with the people of all ethnic groups across the country to enter a prosperous and happy socialist society. However, brucellosis is seriously threatening them.

　　After brucellosis, which seriously threatens the health of humans and animals and the development of agricultural and animal husbandry production, was discovered, the Party and government leaders of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region paid sufficient attention to it, and the central government also provided great support. In 1953, brucellosis prevention and control institutions were established to begin investigation and research work, and pilot treatment work was carried out as a key point. Last year, on the basis of summarizing the prevention and control work over the past few years, the People's Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region issued the "Instructions on Actively Carrying Out Brucellosis Prevention and Control Work." Mass organizations of brucellosis prevention and control committees have been established in various leagues, administrative districts, cities, banners, and counties. Under the leadership of the people's committees at all levels, prevention and control work is carried out. A brucellosis prevention and control research institute has been established, equipped with professional staff. Prevention and control organizations have also been established in health institutions at all levels and some animal husbandry and veterinary work stations. Han and Mongolian medical personnel have been widely organized to conduct comprehensive investigation, research, and prevention and control work. The autonomous region's health department will also organize some experts, professors, and professionals to carry out scientific research on brucellosis, master the regional epidemic history, transmission routes, and effective prevention and control methods, and create conditions for further large-scale prevention and control work.

　　Here, I especially request the relevant departments of the central government to consider including brucellosis prevention and control work in the national research project.

　　We will do everything in our power to control the spread and epidemic of brucellosis and eliminate it.

　　It is not difficult to imagine that there are many difficulties in eliminating such an enemy, brucellosis, which is almost all over the vast Inner Mongolia region. But we believe that under the shining of the great national policy of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will certainly, like in the past when they overcame all epidemics and natural disasters, strive to completely eliminate brucellosis in the next few years with a heroic and unremitting spirit of struggle!

　　建议把布氏杆菌病防治工作列为国家研究项目
    孙兰峰说，内蒙古卫生防疫工作已经有很大成绩，布氏杆菌病需要大力防治
    我衷心拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的英明指示，周总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告和李富春副总理关于第二个五年计划若干问题的说明，完全同意陈叔通副主席关于政协二届三次常委会的工作报告。毛主席的指示和周总理的报告是对当前国内国际问题的马克思列宁主义的科学的精湛论述，将指导我们正确地处理各项工作和问题，保证我们团结国内外一切可以团结的力量，发挥一切积极因素，加速完成祖国伟大的社会主义建设事业。我一定努力把这两个有历史意义的文件学习好，提高自己的思想认识，领会与掌握文件的精神，贯彻到工作中去。
    内蒙古自治区在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，已经实现了区域自治，建立了“民族平等、亲密团结、互相帮助、共同发展”的新的民族关系。各民族人民为了摆脱贫困和落后，实现事实上的民族平等，正以极大的热情和积极性，艰苦英勇地进行着各项生产建设工作。同全国各地一样，内蒙古自治区在1956年实现了对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。在改变了生产关系的基础上，出现了新的生产高潮。1956年的农业生产获得空前丰收，牧业生产也有重大发展。目前内蒙古自治区各族人民正在社会主义改造胜利的基础上，在全区范围内开展着大生产运动，为争取1957年的更大丰收，为支援国家社会主义建设而作着不懈的努力。
    现在，我仅就内蒙古自治区的卫生防疫工作和布氏杆菌病的防治问题，在这里作一简要发言。
    历史上所有反动统治者都是从根本上就不关心人民疾苦的，并且由于反动统治者压迫和剥削的结果，给人民留下了不少疾病和困苦。这种现象，在少数民族地区更显得格外严重。解放后，内蒙古自治区各族人民在党和政府的领导下，向各种疫病和困苦进行了艰苦的斗争，到现在，已获得了巨大成就。曾经猖獗一时的鼠疫已被控制，能够使其不在人间发生和流行；为害内蒙人民健康的性病，经大力防治已使其停止发展，并在逐步消灭中；妇幼卫生工作也有重大开展。现在内蒙少数民族人口已由过去的下降而逐年上升。同时也确保了国际交通线的畅通和工业基地建设及各项生产的顺利进行。
    我们1956年的卫生防疫等工作就是在这个基础上进行的，并把重点放在消灭危害人民最大的疫病的斗争上来。在鼠疫防治工作上，扩大了疫源检索范围，基本上查清了疫源区，进行了野外大面积上的灭鼠工作，仅在呼伦贝尔等四个盟，两个行政区的统计就完成四万五千一百零七平方公里的毒鼠面积。经重点调查，毒鼠后每公顷的鼠洞平均下降到四个以下，通辽市抽查了六个屯，每百间房只有三个鼠洞。昭乌达盟十个旗县的调查，就出现了七百一十个无鼠屯，使家鼠和野鼠的密度，直线下降。还在重点地区接种了鼠疫活动疫苗一百四十余万人次，较1955年增加了三倍，提高了居民的免疫能力。因此，1956年没有发生人间疫情。但鼠间鼠疫的发生和流行，仍经常威胁着我区各族人民的健康和安全，因此必须提高警惕，继续加强对这一工作的重视。在性病防治工作上，去年又在各盟设置了性病防治专业机构，大力开展了性病防治工作。全年普查了二十万零五千七百八十四人次，这个数目比1950到1955年的六年内全区普查人次的总和还要多，普查率达地区常住人口的85％到90％以上，并免费治疗了二万一千二百四十五个患者，相当于1953年到1955年的三年内全区治疗总人数的十五倍。麻疹死亡率较1955年降低0.14％，流行性出血热发病人数较1955年降低40％。对其他一些地方病，重点的，如克山病，布氏杆菌病等也进行了研究和治疗。在妇幼卫生工作上，已培养各民族助产士二百九十五名，保健员四百四十二名，改造旧产婆及训练接生员共一万零五百三十八名，新建了保健所、保健站、接生站、接生组，在农、牧区还建立了中心接生站，推行了便利群众、特别是便利牧民群众的巡回工作法，对产妇进行产前产后的检查，广泛推行了新法接生，婴儿破伤风死亡率大大减少，由1950年的53％，下降到1.15％。训练了妇幼卫生宣传员一千零五十一名，广泛地开展了妇幼卫生的宣传教育工作，受到了农牧民的极大欢迎。各盟、行政区、市综合医院均设有20％的妇产科病床，和10％的小儿科病床。卫生防疫和妇幼卫生工作，对增强各族人民健康，对保证各项生产建设的顺利进行，都起了很大的作用。
    下面我想就内蒙地区布氏杆菌病的防治工作，多讲几句：
    内蒙古自治区在1953年发现了布氏杆菌病。布氏杆菌病是一种牲畜传染病，但也感染人，群众叫这种病为“瘫痪病”，也叫“穷病”。人要是感染了这种病，很快就丧失健康，瘫痪下来，失去劳动能力，不能从事生产，也将失去生育能力。牲畜得了这种病也是如此。母畜流产，更为严重。这种病菌容易感染，凡接触疫畜就有被感染的可能。如牧工、接羔保育人员、饲养管理人员、畜牧兽医工作人员、屠宰人员，在接触疫畜时，如无防护设备，不经过消毒处理，就有被感染的可能。家庭主妇及炊事人员如触及带菌的肉类，或者食用了不十分烂熟的有菌的肉食，也有被感染的危险。根据现有调查材料，除巴彦淖尔盟未进行调查，察哈尔盟未发现外，其他六个盟、两个行政区的部分旗县内都有布氏杆菌病的发生和流行，呼和浩特市、包头市也发现了病畜和病人。据我们在六个盟两个行政区中的四十四个旗县内的调查：人的血清检验阳性反应率，最高的达20％到25％；牛羊的血清检验阳性反应率，最高的达到15％到20％；牛羊流产率平均为20％到25％。估计全区约有布氏杆菌病人十万人，约占全区人口总数的1.17％强，其中完全丧失劳动能力的病人，约有二万五千人，这个数目是很惊人的。如果每个病人的病期，即完全不能从事生产的时期为一年（由于群众经济条件及我们防治技术条件的限制，往往不是一年内可以治好、可以完全恢复健康的），则每年就损失九百万个劳动日。这些劳动日如果都能从事农业生产，就可为国家多生产五千万斤粮食，就可供二十万人的城镇吃一年。估计全区约有病畜二百万到三百万头，如果病畜中有二分之一是能够生育的母畜，大约每年就要流产小畜二十万到三十万头。再由于我们防治及其他条件的限制，目前还不能控制这种病的发展和蔓延，实际损失数字较上述数字还要大。这就是布氏杆菌病给内蒙各族人民带来的重大危害。人患了这种病之后不能生育，这对少数民族说来，危害就更加严重了。
    内蒙古自治区的牧业经济在整个国民经济中占有相当大的比重。牧区是完全从事畜牧业生产，半农半牧区畜牧业生产占了整个生产的一大半，农业区的畜牧业，也占相当比重，内蒙区农民的主要副业生产一般就是畜牧业。这就是说，内蒙广大农牧民大多数都是饲养牲畜的，都要与牲畜接触，而且他们为了增加生产获得丰收，支援国家社会主义工业化，夜以继日地辛勤劳动着，要把大量的肉食、乳品和皮毛供应国内城市的需要，并向国外出口。内蒙古自治区各族人民全心全意地要把自治区建设好，同全国各族人民携手共同进入繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。但布氏杆菌病却在严重地威胁着他们。
    当严重威胁人畜健康和农牧业生产发展的布氏杆菌病一被发现之后，内蒙古自治区党政领导上，就给予了足够重视，中央也给予了很大支援。在1953年就建立了布氏杆菌病防治机构，开始进行调查研究工作，并重点进行试点治疗工作。去年又在总结了几年来的防治工作的基础上，内蒙古自治区人民委员会发布了“积极开展布氏杆菌病防治工作的指示”，各盟、行政区，市、旗县，都建立了布氏杆菌病防治委员会的群众性组织，在各级人民委员会领导下进行防治工作，建立了布氏杆菌病防治研究所，配备了专业工作人员，各级卫生机构和部分畜牧兽医工作站也设立了防治组织，并广泛组织了汉、蒙医务人员，全面进行调查研究和防治工作。自治区卫生部门还将组织一些专家、教授和专业人员开展布氏杆菌病的科学研究工作，掌握地区疫情史，传染途径及有效的防治办法，给进一步开展大规模的防治工作创造条件。
    这里我特别请求中央有关部门考虑，能够把布氏杆菌病的防治工作列入国家研究项目之内。
    我们将尽一切努力，从事控制布氏杆菌病的蔓延、流行和消灭工作。
    在辽阔的内蒙地区要消灭这样一个几乎遍及全区的敌人——布氏杆菌病，不难想到困难是很多的。但我们相信，在中国共产党和毛主席伟大民族政策的光辉照耀下，在中共中央和国务院的正确领导下，内蒙古自治区各族人民一定仍像过去战胜一切疫病和自然灾害一样，将以英勇不懈的斗争精神，争取在近几年内把布氏杆菌病彻底消灭干净！（附图片）
