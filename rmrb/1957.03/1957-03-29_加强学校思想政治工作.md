　　Strengthening Ideological and Political Work in Schools

Strengthening ideological and political education in higher and secondary schools is a pressing task for educational administrative departments, the Communist Party, and the Communist Youth League. Trade unions and democratic parties in schools should also undertake this task.

Schools should cultivate students to become well-rounded individuals, that is, talents who serve socialist construction, are physically healthy, love the motherland, and possess a certain level of Marxist-Leninist ideological understanding. The fundamental requirement of ideological and political work in schools is to educate students to establish a correct worldview and outlook on life, cultivate communist moral character, and foster the fundamental idea of serving the people and socialism. Young students are enthusiastic about new things, and teachers and school leaders should cherish their vigor and cultivate their ability to think independently and distinguish right from wrong. Only when young people have the correct ability to analyze specific things can they distinguish right from wrong, differentiate between friend and foe, and stand firm in complex situations.

The vast majority of students in our country love the motherland and the cause of socialism. However, this does not allow us to believe that the ideological and political education in schools is already satisfactory. On the contrary, there are still many significant shortcomings in the current ideological and political education in schools. Educational administrative departments generally neglect the leadership of ideological and political education, considering it to be the work of Party organizations. Secondary schools lack appropriate political education subjects. The content of political education often fails to combine with various practical tasks and the specific ideological situation of the masses, and ideological work often remains at a relatively simple and generalized level. Due to these shortcomings, students often do not pay close attention to current affairs and policies or cannot understand them correctly, sometimes have an inappropriate understanding of the meaning of learning, lack sufficient ideological preparation for engaging in productive labor after graduation, and lack connection with the working people in terms of ideological feelings and living habits.

In order to strengthen ideological and political work in schools, educational administrative departments must first take responsibility. Both junior and senior high schools must set up political courses suitable for the needs of students, and strengthen extracurricular ideological and political education. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously strengthen the ranks of cadres engaged in political work. The main leaders of the school, principals, vice-principals, Party committee secretaries, as well as local Party and administrative leading cadres, should regularly give reports to students, give lectures, and conduct education in a timely manner, targeting the students' actual ideological situation. Teachers should integrate with students, combining teaching with guiding students to advance not only in their studies but also in their thinking.

Schools should carry out patient persuasion and education, and guide young students step by step. They should conduct in-depth research on specific matters, make specific analyses, and view problems comprehensively, opposing one-sidedness. In ideological and political education, special attention should be paid to using the methods of mass self-education, actively guiding, and through debate and discussion, the truth will become clearer, and the educational effect will be greater.

Labor education is one of the important contents of ideological and political work for students. Whether it is primary schools, secondary schools, or universities, labor education should be carried out regularly to cultivate students' excellent qualities of loving labor and loving the working people, and to cultivate students' ability to apply knowledge, skills, and proficiency to productive practice. At present, special efforts should be made to cultivate in primary and secondary school students the psychology of considering it an honor to participate in agricultural, handicraft, commercial, transportation, and industrial labor after graduation, and to correct the mistaken idea of many primary and secondary school students and their parents that primary and secondary school graduates should only go on to higher education. For university students, attention should also be paid to cultivating their excellent qualities of being able to work hard and be good at integrating with the masses after taking up their jobs.

We must not forget that this generation of young students is growing up under the conditions of socialism's victory and the creation of good conditions for cultivating young people. This generation of young students has not experienced the tempering of revolutionary struggles, nor has it experienced the hardships and difficulties encountered by their predecessors. Some young students do not understand how much blood and sweat their predecessors shed in exchange for today's learning and living conditions, and even today, the learning rights enjoyed by every middle school and university student still require a lot of labor from many workers as the price. However, some young people rarely consider their obligations to society and the people in their studies and life; some young students ask more from the country, but think very little about what contributions they are prepared to make to the country. The younger generation is the one who inherits the revolutionary cause. How can schools enable them to maintain the revolutionary fighting spirit of "climbing snow-capped mountains and crossing grasslands"? How can they serve the people wholeheartedly like their predecessors? The answer to this question is to educate young people in revolutionary traditions, so that they can inherit the glorious revolutionary traditions and carry forward the spirit of hard struggle.

At present, we are in a period of great social change. When old contradictions are resolved, new contradictions will arise. Socialist ideology and consciousness grow up in the constant struggle with bourgeois ideology and various non-proletarian ideologies. From the perspective of the whole society, the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie still exists seriously, and many students come from families of landlords, rich peasants, and the bourgeoisie. Therefore, this ideological influence will inevitably be reflected in schools. Helping students overcome incorrect ideological influences and cultivating the younger generation to become communist fighters and builders of a new society is not only the country's lofty task, but also the students' earnest wish. An article by Lü Mingzhuo, a student of Shandong Normal College, published on page four of today's newspaper, writes: "We need proletarian ideological education, just as seedlings cannot do without the nourishment of sunlight and rain. We hope to strengthen our proletarian ideological consciousness and overcome the influence of bourgeois ideology through regular communist education, and cultivate ourselves into construction talents with both ability and integrity needed by the motherland." This represents the requirements of the vast majority of students. So, how should schools respond to the students' demands? Without a doubt, all school leaders and teachers should use sufficient communist sunshine and rain to cultivate the seedlings and flowers of the younger generation, so that they can grow up healthily.

### 加强学校思想政治工作

　　加强学校思想政治工作
    加强高等和中等学校的思想政治教育，是目前教育行政部门和共产党、青年团的一项迫切任务。学校中的工会和民主党派组织，也应该同样担负起这个任务。
    学校应当培养学生成为全面发展的人才，也就是培养为社会主义建设服务的、体魄健全的、热爱祖国的和具有一定马克思列宁主义思想水平的人才。学校思想政治工作的根本要求，是教育学生树立正确的世界观和人生观，养成共产主义的道德品质，培养学生为人民、为社会主义服务的根本思想。青年学生对新鲜事物都很热心，教师和学校的领导者要爱护他们的朝气，培养他们独立思考、分辨是非的能力。只有青年具有了正确的分析具体事物的能力，才能在复杂的情况下明辨是非，分清敌我，站稳立场。
    我国的学生绝大多数都热爱祖国，热爱社会主义事业。但是这并不能使我们认为学校的思想政治教育已经可以满意了。相反，在目前的学校思想政治教育中还有许多重大的缺点。教育行政部门一般地忽视了思想政治教育的领导，认为这是党组织的工作。中等学校中没有适当的政治教育的科目。政治教育的内容往往没有结合各种实际工作和群众的具体思想情况，思想工作往往停留在比较简单的和一般化的方法上。由于这些缺点，学生对于当前时事政策往往不很注意或者不能正确地了解，对于学习的意义有时也认识得不适当，对于毕业以后从事生产劳动缺乏足够的思想准备，在思想感情和生活习惯上同劳动人民也缺乏联系。
    为了加强学校的思想政治工作，教育行政部门必须首先担负起责任来。无论初级中学和高级中学，都要设置适合于学生需要的政治课程，并且加强课外的思想政治教育。因此，必须大力加强政治工作的干部力量。学校的主要负责人，校长、副校长、党委书记以及当地的党和行政的领导干部，要经常向学生作报告，上大课，及时地针对学生的实际思想情况进行教育。教师要同学生打成一片，结合教学，引导学生不但在学业上而且在思想上前进。
    学校对青年学生进行思想政治工作，应该进行耐心的说服教育，循循善诱，对具体事物要深入研究，作具体分析，全面地看待问题，反对片面性。在思想政治教育工作中，特别要注意运用群众自我教育的方法，积极引导，通过争辩讨论，真理就会愈辩愈明，教育效果就会更大。
    劳动教育是对学生进行思想政治工作的重要内容之一。无论小学校、中等学校和高等学校，都应该经常地进行劳动教育，培养学生热爱劳动、热爱劳动人民的优良品质，培养学生善于把知识、技能和熟练的技巧运用到生产实践中去。在目前，特别应该努力培养中小学生把在毕业以后参加农业、手工业、商业、运输业和工业的劳动认为光荣的心理，纠正许多中小学生和他们的家长认为中小学生毕了业只应该升学的错误观念。对于高等学校的学生，也要注意培养他们在走上工作岗位以后能够艰苦劳动、善于同群众打成一片的优秀品质。
    我们不要忘记，这一代青年学生是在社会主义已经胜利，已经创造了良好的培养青年的条件下成长的。这一代青年学生没有经过革命斗争的锻炼，没有经过前辈所遭遇的那种艰苦和困难。有的青年学生不了解，他们的前辈流了多少血汗，才换来今天的学习和生活条件，而且就在今天，每一个中学生大学生所享受的学习权利，也还需要很多劳动者付出大量的劳动作为代价。可是，有的青年在学习和生活中却很少考虑到对社会对人民的义务；有的青年学生向国家要求多，而准备为国家作些什么贡献，却想得很少。年青一代是继承革命事业的人，学校怎样才能使他们保持“爬雪山、过草地”的革命斗志呢？怎样才能像前辈那样全心全意为人民服务呢？回答这个问题，就是要向青年进行革命传统的教育，使他们能够继承光荣的革命传统，发扬艰苦奋斗的作风。
    目前，我们正处在社会大变动的时期，旧的矛盾解决了，又会产生新的矛盾。社会主义思想意识是同资产阶级思想以及各种非无产阶级思想不断斗争中成长起来的。从整个社会来说，资产阶级的思想影响还严重地存在，而学生中又有许多出身于地主、富农、资产阶级的家庭，因此，这种思想影响，在学校中必然会有所反映。帮助学生克服不正确的思想影响，培养年青的一代成为共产主义的战士和新社会的建设者，不但是国家的崇高的任务，而且是学生群众的恳切愿望。今天本报第四版刊登的山东师范学院学生吕明灼的文章写道：“我们需要无产阶级思想教育，就像禾苗离不了阳光雨露的滋养一样。我们希望通过经常接受共产主义教育，加强我们的无产阶级的思想意识，克服资产阶级思想影响，把自己培养成祖国需要的德才兼备的建设人材。”这代表了绝大多数学生的要求。那末，学校应当怎样回答学生的要求呢？毫无疑问，所有学校的领导工作人员和教师，应该用充分的共产主义的阳光和雨露，去培养年青一代的禾苗花卉，使他们健康地成长。
