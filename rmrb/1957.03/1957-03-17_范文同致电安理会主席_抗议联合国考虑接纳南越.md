Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 16th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, Pham Van Dong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, cabled the President of the United Nations Security Council on March 13th to protest the United Nations General Assembly's adoption, by a majority vote on February 28th, of the United States' proposal requesting the Security Council to consider accepting South Vietnam into the United Nations.

In the cable, Pham Van Dong emphasized that the proposal put forward by the United States is a violation of the Geneva Agreements and the agreement of the Tenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. Vietnam is an indivisible whole, and South Vietnam cannot be regarded as a separate country. Therefore, South Vietnam cannot join the United Nations.

Pham Van Dong requested that the United Nations Security Council reject this suggestion and refuse to admit South Vietnam into the United Nations.

    范文同致电安理会主席
    抗议联合国考虑接纳南越
    新华社河内16日电　据越南通讯社消息：越南民主共和国外交部部长范文同在3月13日致电联合国安全理事会主席，抗议联合国大会在2月28日以多数票通过美国要求安全理事会考虑接受越南南方加入联合国的提案。
    范文同在电文中强调说，美国提出的这个提案是违反日内瓦协议和联合国第十届大会的协议的。越南是一个不可分割的整体，不能把越南南方看作一个单独的国家。因此，越南南方不能加入联合国。
    范文同要求联合国安全理事会驳斥这个建议，拒绝接纳越南南方加入联合国。
