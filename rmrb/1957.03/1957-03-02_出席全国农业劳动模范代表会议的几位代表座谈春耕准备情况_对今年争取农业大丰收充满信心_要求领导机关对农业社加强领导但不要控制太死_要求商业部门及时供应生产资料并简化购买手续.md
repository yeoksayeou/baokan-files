Several Delegates Attending the National Agricultural Labor Model Representatives Conference Discuss Spring Planting Preparations
Full of Confidence in Striving for a Bumper Harvest This Year
Demand that Leading Organs Strengthen Leadership over Agricultural Cooperatives but Not Control them Too Rigidly; Demand that Commercial Departments Supply Means of Production in a Timely Manner and Simplify Purchasing Procedures

(Our Dispatch) Several advanced agricultural cooperative directors attending the National Agricultural Labor Model Representatives Conference spoke at a forum convened by the newspaper's editorial department on the evening of February 25th, regarding the spring planting preparations of the agricultural cooperatives they lead. They also put forward many valuable opinions on leadership and commercial work.

These labor models have high confidence in striving for a bumper agricultural harvest this year, unanimously agreeing that spring planting preparations this year are earlier and better than last year. Last year, large cooperatives were only just being formed at this time, and they were unfamiliar with land and labor conditions. Sowing plans and labor allocation were not well prepared. Some cooperatives were still digging wells and mobilizing members to contribute fodder and seeds at this time last year. This year, these problems do not exist. Production plans were set last autumn, and enough seeds and fodder were reserved. Wells have been dug, and fertilizers are also not a major problem. Some cooperatives are inspecting farm tools, and some have already repaired them. Zeng Guangfu, a labor model from Shen County, Shandong, said, "Now, all that remains is to lead production wholeheartedly."

The high production enthusiasm and strong confidence in increased production of these advanced agricultural cooperatives can be seen from the production targets they have set and some of their production arrangements. For example, the Guoguang Cooperative in Jieyu County, Shanxi, led by Qu Yaoli, plans to produce an average of 260 jin of ginned cotton per mu this year, although the cotton field area is about the same as last year, the yield per unit is planned to increase by 50 jin compared to last year. The planned yield of cotton at the Jianguo Cooperative in Linyi County, Shandong, led by Zhao Lincheng, is 250 jin of ginned cotton, an increase of 40 jin compared to last year. Despite the short frost-free period in Jianchang County, Liaoning, which affects cotton growth, the Pioneer Agricultural Cooperative led by Huang Yuanling in this county still plans to increase cotton production by 20% this year, based on last year's 278 jin. The Gouzhao Cooperative in the suburbs of Zhengzhou, Henan, led by Zhao Heihei, and the Xingqi Cooperative in Sui County, Hubei, led by He Shaohe, have also formulated advanced and reliable production increase targets for this year. They have already done a lot of preparatory work to achieve this year's task of increasing cotton production.

In their view, there are still difficulties in spring planting production this year. Many old cooperatives feel that funds are very tight, and the financial difficulties of new cooperatives are even greater. The shortage of draught animals is also a major problem. Chen Yongkang said: This heavy snow is very unfavorable for livestock. They believe that some legacy problems of the new cooperatives have not been well resolved, and the preparatory work for spring planting is not very good, requiring stronger leadership.

When discussing leadership work, the labor models made many suggestions and comments. Zeng Guangfu, a deputy to the National People's Congress, saw that many third-category and second-category cooperatives were not being helped during his inspections, and he requested that Party committees strengthen leadership over these cooperatives. They all demanded that cadres be sent down quickly; very few have returned to the cooperatives so far. Some cadres still have the work style of undertaking everything on behalf of others and resorting to coercion and commandism when they go to the countryside. The labor models requested that newspapers publish more experiences in democratic cooperative management.

Rao Xingli, the director of the October Cooperative in Xishui County, Hubei, felt that the tasks assigned by the higher authorities often did not fit the actual situation of the cooperative. It is difficult not to do them, but then the task of being a "key cooperative" is not completed, which puts them in a dilemma. There are still too many meetings, which should be reduced. Zheng Wenhe, the director of the Shunjiang Agricultural Cooperative in Neijiang County, Sichuan, believes that attention should still be paid to landlords and rich peasants who have joined the cooperative. Some labor models urgently requested the opportunity to learn the technology of using new farm tools. Rao Xingli said: In 1956, we often worked at night, but we still couldn't finish the work. It is impossible to improve without improving farm tools and technology.

They mentioned that the supply of means of production is often not timely, and they believe that the work of commercial departments should be further improved. Wang Hanguo, the director of the First Cooperative of Meide Township, Jieyang, Guangdong, said: Last year, Jieyang County had more than 600,000 mu of late rice, and because of the shortage of chemical fertilizers, which also arrived late, each mu yielded at least several dozen jin less. Rao Xingli said: Last year, there was a drought for several months. We had waterwheels, but we lacked belts. I traveled from Xishui to Hankou. Hankou clearly had them but wouldn't sell them, saying that they needed to make a plan. Making a plan also requires many procedures. It's not just buying belts that's like this; buying pesticides also requires signing a one-year contract. Who can know how much pest damage there will be at the beginning of the year and how much pesticide will be needed? If you sign a contract and don't buy, you will be penalized. Therefore, they hope that the production materials supply departments will arrange these tasks as soon as possible. Huang Yuanling said: This year, we are using "1605," which is extremely toxic, and we hope to supply sprayers in a timely manner. Qu Yaoli also hopes that the chemical fertilizers expected to be supplied to cotton-growing areas will be transported to cotton-growing areas as early as possible.

    出席全国农业劳动模范代表会议的几位代表座谈春耕准备情况
    对今年争取农业大丰收充满信心
    要求领导机关对农业社加强领导但不要控制太死  要求商业部门及时供应生产资料并简化购买手续
    本报讯  出席全国农业劳动模范代表会议的几位先进农业社的主任，2月25日晚在本报编辑部召集的座谈会上，谈到了他们领导的农业社今年春耕生产的准备情况，并对领导工作和商业工作提出许多宝贵意见。
    这几位劳动模范对于争取今年的农业大丰收有很高的信心，一致认为今年的春耕准备得比去年早，也比去年要好。去年这时候才并成大社，土地、劳力情况都不熟悉，播种计划、劳力调配等都没有做好。有的社去年这时候还在打井，还在动员社员出饲草、出种子；今年，这些问题都不存在了。生产规划去年秋后就订好了，种子、饲草也留够了，井也打成了，肥料也不成大问题了。有的社正在检修农具，有的社已经修好。山东莘县劳动模范曾广福说：“现在只剩下一心一意领导生产了。”
    这些先进农业社的生产热情高，增产信心强，可以从他们社里订的生产指标和一些生产安排上看出来。例如曲耀离领导的山西解虞县国光社，今年棉田面积虽然同去年差不多，但是，单位产量却比去年提高五十市斤，计划平均每亩产籽棉二百六十斤。赵林成所领导的山东临邑县建国社，今年棉花的计划产量是籽棉二百五十斤，比去年提高四十斤。尽管辽宁建昌县无霜期很短，影响棉花生长，但是这个县由黄元龄所领导的先锋农业社，今年棉花产量仍计划在去年的二百七十八斤的基础上再提高20％。赵黑孩、何绍和所领导的河南郑州市郊区沟赵社和湖北随县星旗社，也都制订出今年的先进可靠的增产指标。他们为实现今年增产棉花的任务，已经作了许多准备工作。
    在他们看来，今年春耕生产中还是有困难的。许多老社感到资金很紧，新社资金困难更大些。耕畜不足也是个大问题。陈永康说：这场大雪对牲口很不利。他们认为新社有些遗留问题没有很好地解决，备耕工作不怎样好，需要加强领导。
    在谈领导工作的时候，劳动模范们提了许多建议和意见。曾广福是全国人民代表大会代表，他在视察的时候看到很多三类社、二类社没人帮助，要求党委对这些社加强领导。他们都要求快把干部往下放，现在回到社的还很少。有的干部下乡还有包办代替、强迫命令的作风。劳动模范们要求报纸上多介绍些民主办社的经验。
    湖北浠水县十月社主任饶兴礼感到上级交来的任务，常常不切合社里的实际情况。不搞吧，又没完成“重点社”的任务，很为难。会议也仍然太多，应该减少一些。四川内江县顺江农业社主任郑文和认为：对于入社的地主富农分子仍然不可放松注意。有的劳动模范迫切要求有机会学习使用新式农具的技术。饶兴礼说：1956年经常打夜工，活还是干不完，农具不改进，技术不提高是不行。
    他们谈到生产资料的供应往往不及时，认为商业部门的工作还应当再加改进。广东揭阳美德乡第一社主任汪汉国说：去年揭阳县六十多万亩晚稻，因为化学肥料少，又来得晚，每亩至少要少收几十斤。饶兴礼说：去年旱了几个月，我们有水车，就少个皮带，我从浠水跑到汉口，汉口明明有也不卖，说是要造计划，造计划还要经过很多手续。不光买皮带是这样，买农药还要求订一年的合同。年初谁能知道虫害多大，要多少农药？订了合同不买还要受罚。因此，他们希望生产资料供应部门要尽快安排这些工作。黄元龄说：今年用的是毒性极大的“一六○五”，希望及时供应喷雾器。曲耀离也希望把预计供应给棉区的化学肥料，早些调运到棉区。
