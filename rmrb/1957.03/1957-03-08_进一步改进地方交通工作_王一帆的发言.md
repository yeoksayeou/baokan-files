I wholeheartedly endorse Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people, delivered at the enlarged Supreme State Conference. I fully agree with Premier Zhou's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries and his correct analysis of the overall international situation. I also fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report and his summary of the industrial and commercial sector's study.

**From 75,000 kilometers to 220,000 kilometers**

Regarding local transportation, I would like to share my personal opinions.

Local transportation work, in recent years, has seen rapid development and achieved great success under the attention of Party committees and governments at all levels and the enthusiastic participation of the broad masses of people. Taking highways alone, the total length open to traffic was only 75,000 kilometers at the end of 1949, but now it has reached over 220,000 kilometers. Due to the high tide of agricultural cooperation and the promulgation of the Forty Articles of the National Programme for Agricultural Development (Draft), the construction of local roads was carried out more extensively throughout the country in 1956. Highways have been built to 149 counties that were previously inaccessible. In Gannan Prefecture, Gansu Province, the 270-kilometer highway from Wudu to Wenxian and Kangxian was completed last year. This project was extremely arduous. The Kuomintang regime surveyed it three times but failed to build it. Now, thanks to the support of the broad masses of people, it was completed in just seven months. Similar situations exist in various provinces and regions. The construction of these highways has played a significant role in the political, economic, and cultural aspects of various regions, especially in remote mountainous areas and ethnic minority areas. Where highways are built, prosperity and happiness are promoted, presenting a new look. When the highway crossed the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, known as the "Roof of the World," new cities have emerged along the route. Zhamu, which originally had only three or four households, is now lined with houses. After the Yixi Highway, which connects the Greater and Lesser Liang Mountains, was opened to traffic, the local people could buy rice and salt, and the exchange prices of local products such as cattle and sheepskins and valuable medicinal materials increased by one to four or five times, respectively, immediately improving people's lives. The local Yi people happily said: "The Communist Party is brighter than the sun. The sun can only shine on the sunny side of the mountain, but not on the shady side. The Communist Party shines on both the shady and sunny sides."

Although local transportation construction has made great achievements, due to China's vast territory, the rapid development of industry and agriculture, the weak original foundation, and some shortcomings in our work, the development of transportation is still far from meeting actual needs. The situation of transportation tension and difficulties is still very serious. Market supplies in many areas are out of stock, and goods are seriously backlogged. Waiting for a car or boat often takes ten days or half a month. The local specialties of many mountainous and old revolutionary base areas cannot be transported out, and daily necessities cannot be transported in. In some mountainous areas of Sichuan, medicinal materials are burned as firewood, and mountain goods become waste. In Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, it is reported that 100 eggs can be bought for one yuan in some mountainous areas. In some areas, the severity of "difficulty in traveling" even reaches the point of crawling over cliffs and wading through deep water, and accidents involving falls and drownings still occur frequently. Therefore, one can often hear the cries of the people in the mountainous areas: "The mountains are high, the mountains are long, climb the mountains and call for mother," "Everything is carried on the shoulders, half a lifetime is spent on the road," "Not afraid of buying grain, only afraid of delivering grain." The desire of the people in the mountainous areas to improve transportation conditions is so urgent!

In order to meet the demands of the people and gradually change the backward situation of local transportation, I suggest taking the following measures:

**Implement the Instruction on Civilian Labor Construction, Diligent Maintenance, and Nourishment of Highways**

We should further emphasize the construction of local roads, especially in mountainous areas, old revolutionary base areas, and ethnic minority areas. However, local roads are a project with a wide scope and large volume, which cannot be completely solved by state investment. According to the experience of the Soviet Union, the construction of local roads mainly relies on local resources. From the October Revolution to the present, the method of civilian labor construction and diligent maintenance has been implemented. All collective farm members and self-employed farmers are required to have six diligent workdays each year. The Chinese people have always had a fine tradition of repairing bridges and roads. The facts in the past few years since liberation have proved that the masses of farmers have enthusiastically participated in this work in accordance with the principle of ensuring both production and road construction. After agricultural cooperation, various regions have created methods of representing work with diligent labor construction. Therefore, without affecting agricultural production and with full attention to cherishing the people's strength, various regions should properly continue to implement the State Council's instructions on improving civilian labor construction, diligent maintenance, and nourishing highways and constructing local roads. As for the necessary expenses, in addition to asking the provincial people's committees to consider providing appropriate investment, a certain proportion should be stipulated in the self-raised funds of counties and townships. We can also consider using the "dead-end grain" method. For example, in the past, the Gannan Administrative Office of Jiangxi Province, in view of the fact that Anyuan County produced grain but had no way to transport it out, resulting in the spoilage of grain in the producing area, allocated 200,000 catties of grain from the area to build the highway from Pengshi to Anyuan, solving the long-term problem of grain transportation in the future. We can also ask relevant material departments to advance transportation costs. It is said that this year, the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, the Agricultural Products Purchasing Department, and the Grain Bureau plan to invest a portion of the transportation costs they have budgeted to build simple roads. It is estimated that the entire investment can be recovered and more with the transportation costs needed for one year. I think this is very cost-effective.

**Strengthen the Management and Maintenance of Existing Roads**

We should also strengthen the management and maintenance of existing roads. The existing highways are all obtained by the long-term labor of the people. Relevant departments should carefully maintain and manage these routes to serve transportation. As for the collection of highway maintenance fees, it was originally set up for the purpose of maintaining highways, but some provinces have not given sufficient consideration to the need for highway maintenance funds, and there are cases of diverting them for other uses. For example, Gansu Province can collect 8 million yuan in road maintenance fees this year, while the investment is only 5.5 million yuan. In fact, the mileage of highway maintenance in the province has increased a lot compared with last year. Other provinces and regions such as Guangdong, Xinjiang, and Guizhou also have similar situations. Therefore, the provincial finance departments should not only strengthen supervision, but also make reasonable arrangements. The income from road maintenance fees should first be considered for use in road maintenance, and the shortfall should also be appropriately balanced by the province. This is in line with the purpose of collecting road maintenance fees to facilitate transportation.

**Vigorously Organize and Utilize Folk Transportation Tools**

We should also give full play to all potential to alleviate the tense situation of transportation, such as strengthening the operation and management of transportation departments, organizing vehicles of government agencies and enterprises to undertake transportation, and especially, we should vigorously organize and utilize folk transportation tools and carry out technical improvement work in a planned way. Folk transportation tools have a long history in our country. As early as the Xia Dynasty, there were simple two-wheeled wooden vehicles. The Zhou Dynasty and the Qin and Han Dynasties saw further development. There are currently about 5 million animal-powered vehicles, about 11 million human-powered vehicles, and about 270,000 inland wooden sailboats, which undertake a large proportion of transportation tasks. These folk transportation tools should be technically improved in a planned way to gradually improve their transportation efficiency and better adapt to the needs of national construction. This should arouse sufficient attention from relevant departments.

Launch an increase production and conserve resources campaign in the transportation sector. On the one hand, effective measures should continue to be taken to improve the problems of low quality, frequent accidents, and high costs. On the other hand, the spirit of decentralization should also be followed to appropriately streamline the upper layers and strengthen the lower layers. In particular, the county-level transportation agencies are mostly unsound. Some counties with more closed transportation and the most urgent need for transportation, do not have transportation agencies. As for the township level, there is simply no one managing this matter. In order to improve local transportation work, the basic-level institutions must be established and improved to change the phenomenon of communication only at the top and not at the bottom.

The above suggestions are obviously not comprehensive and specific enough, and are limited by my level. The one-sidedness of subjective understanding is inevitable. Please criticize and correct. (Attached picture)

### 进一步改进地方交通工作  王一帆的发言

    进一步改进地方交通工作
    王一帆的发言
    我衷心地拥护毛主席在扩大的最高国务会议上所作的正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的指示，我完全同意周总理作的访问亚洲和欧洲十一国家的报告和他对整个国际形势的正确分析。并完全同意陈叔通副主席的工作报告和对于工商界学习的总结。
    从七万五千公里发展到二十二万公里
    现就地方交通问题，谈谈我个人的意见。
    地方交通工作，这几年来，在各级党政的重视和广大人民群众的热情参加下，有着飞跃的发展，已取得了很大成绩。单从公路来看，1949年底仅有通车里程七万五千公里，现在已达二十二万余公里。由于农业合作化的高潮，农业发展纲要四十条（草案）的公布，在1956年一年中，全国更广泛的进行了地方道路的修建，以往不通公路的一百四十九个县已修通了。甘肃省武都专区去年完成了武都通往文县、康县，长二百七十公里的公路，这个工程非常艰巨，国民党统治时期勘测三次没有修成，而现在由于广大人民的支持，在短短七个月内就把它修通了；各省各地都有类似的情况。这些公路的修建，对各地区的政治、经济、文化各方面都起了很大作用，特别在边远的山区和少数民族地区，公路修到那里，就促进了那里的繁荣和幸福，呈现了新的面貌。当公路跨过世界屋脊的康藏高原时，沿线已出现新的城市，原来三两户人家的札木，现在已是房屋栉比了；当贯通大小凉山的宜西公路通车后，当地人民可以买到了大米和盐巴，土产牛羊皮、名贵药材的交换价格，分别提高了一至四五倍，人民生活立刻有了改善。当地彝族人民高兴的说：“共产党比太阳还亮，太阳只能照阳山，照不到阴山；共产党却照到了阴山和阳山”。
    虽然地方交通建设已有了很大的成绩，但由于我国幅员辽阔，工农业发展迅速，原来基础薄弱，加之工作上还有若干的缺点，因而交通发展与实际需要，还是远远不相适应，运输紧张、交通困难的情况，还是非常严重。不少地区的市场供应脱销，物资积压严重；等车候船常要十天半月。许多山区、老区的土特产运不出来，日用品运不进去。四川有的山区药材当柴烧，山货成废物；河北邯郸专区反映，有的山区用一块钱可以买到一百个鸡蛋；有的地区“行路难”的严重程度，甚至达到匍伏过悬崖、涉足过深水的地步，跌死、溺死的事故也还是不断发生。因此，常常可以听到山区人民这样的呼声：“山岭高，山岭长，爬上山岭喊亲娘”、“样样东西用肩挑，半世工夫路上跑”、“不怕买粮，只怕送粮”，山区人民要求改善交通条件的心情，是多么地迫切！
    为了适应人民群众的要求，逐渐改变地方交通的落后局面，我建议采取以下的措施：
    贯彻执行民工建勤修养公路的指示
    应该进一步重视地方道路的建设，特别是山区、老区、少数民族地区的道路建设；但是地方道路是面广量大的工程，不可能完全由国家投资来解决。根据苏联的经验，地方道路的建设，主要是依靠地方资源，从十月革命直到现在，都是实行民工建勤的办法，凡属集体农庄庄员和自耕农民，每年每人都规定有六个建勤工日。我国人民一向有着修桥补路的优良传统，解放以后几年来的事实证明，农民群众按照生产、筑路两不误的原则，热情的参加了这项工作，农业合作化后，各地区又创造了代表工建勤的办法。因此在不影响农业生产和充分爱惜民力的精神下，各地区应妥善的继续贯彻国务院关于改进民工建勤养护公路和修建地方道路的指示。至于必需的费用，除请省人民委员会考虑予以适当的投资外，县乡自筹经费中应规定一定的比例。还可以考虑移用“死角粮”办法。如过去江西赣南行署鉴于安远县产粮无路运出，造成粮食在产地霉烂，乃将该地粮食拨出二十万斤，修通了由砰石至安远的公路，解决了今后运粮的长远问题；还可以请有关物资部门垫筹运费的办法。听说今年四川省省联社、农产品采购厅、粮食厅打算把他们所列支的一部分运费来投资修建简易公路，据估计以一年所需的运费，就可收回全部投资而有余。我认为这样做是非常合算的。
    加强对现有道路的管理和养护
    还应该加强对现有道路的管理和养护，现有公路都是人民群众长期用劳动换来的，有关部门应认真养好、管好这些路线来为运输服务。至于公路养路费的征收，本来是为养护公路而设，但有些省对公路养护经费的需要考虑不周，有移作别用的情况，如甘肃省今年养路费可收入八百万元，而投资仅五百五十万元，事实上该省公路养护里程都比去年增加很多，其他如广东、新疆、贵州等省区也有类似情况。因此，希省财政部门既要加强监督，也要安排合理，养路费收入，先应考虑用之于养路，不足之数也应由省适当平衡。这样才符合征收养路费用便利运输的目的。
    大力组织和利用民间运输工具
    还应该发挥一切潜力来缓和运输的紧张局面，如加强运输部门的经营管理，组织机关企业车辆担任运输，特别重要的应该大力组织和利用民间运输工具，并有计划的进行技术改良工作。民间运输工具在我国有着悠久的历史，远在夏代就有简单的二轮木制车，周朝和秦汉时期又有了进一步发展，现有各种类型的兽力车约五百万辆，人力车约一千一百万辆，内河木帆船约二十七万艘，担任了很大比重的运输任务，这些民间运输工具应该有计划的加以技术改良，以逐渐提高它们的运输效率，更好的适应国家建设需要，应该引起有关部门足够的重视。
    开展交通部门的增产节约运动，一方面应针对所存在的质量低、事故多、成本高等方面的问题，继续采取有效措施来加以改进；另一方面也应本着体制下放的精神适当精简上层，充实下层。特别是县一级交通机构，多不健全。有些愈是交通闭塞的县分，对交通需要最迫切的地方，反而没有交通机构。至于乡一级就简直没有人管理这件事。为了改进地方交通工作，必须把基层机构建立和健全起来，以改变上通下不通的现象。
    以上建议显然是不够全面和具体，而且限于水平，主观认识的片面性在所难免，请批评指正。（附图片）
