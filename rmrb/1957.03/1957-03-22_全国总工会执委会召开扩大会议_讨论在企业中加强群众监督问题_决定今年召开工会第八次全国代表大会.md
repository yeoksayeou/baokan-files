Xinhua News Agency, March 21st: The Fifth Plenary Meeting (Enlarged) of the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions closed today. This meeting began on March 14th.

　　This meeting focused on discussing the issue of strengthening mass supervision in enterprises. This issue was raised in accordance with the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, which called for further expanding domestic democratic life and launching a struggle against bureaucracy as China entered the period of socialist construction. The meeting believes that strengthening mass supervision in enterprises means implementing the Party's mass line and attracting the masses to participate in enterprise management. Convening workers' representative conferences is a good way to attract the masses to participate in enterprise management. While strengthening mass supervision and expanding the democratic management system of enterprises, it is necessary to strengthen the work of the trade unions. The work of the various working committees of the trade union and the work of the trade union groups should be combined with the implementation of the resolutions of the workers' representative conferences, so as to further consolidate the system of workers' representative conferences through the work of the various working committees of the trade union and the trade union groups.

　　The meeting believes that in order for the trade union to truly represent the interests of the masses, it must first fully promote democracy within the trade union itself, oppose bureaucratic work styles, and place the work of the trade union under the supervision of the masses. The trade union should work among the masses everywhere by means of guidance. In election activities, coercive methods should not be adopted in order to guarantee the election of a certain person. Trade union group meetings should become places for the masses to express their opinions, and the finances of the trade union must be made public.

　　Looking back on the work in 1956, the meeting believes that the trade unions focused on two tasks in 1956: one was to carry out the advanced producer movement, and the other was to assist the government in carrying out wage reform and the welfare of workers.

　　Last year, the advanced producer movement was enthusiastically launched throughout the country. Compared with the labor competitions of the past, the various tasks in last year's advanced producer movement were more in-depth and meticulous. The formalism in the competition, which was once considered a serious shortcoming, has undergone great changes. The masses have shown more unity and mutual assistance in the competition. The office staff, which had always been considered a blind spot in the competition, also participated in the movement last year. The shortcoming is that the principle of the advanced producer movement: more, faster, better, and more economical was not comprehensive enough, and generally only pursued more and faster, while ignoring better and more economical. Therefore, the quality and cost indicators of many factories and mines were not completed well, and safety was not given enough attention. In a few areas, the movement did not continue and only lasted for a while before declining.

　　Last year's wage reform was a major measure taken by the government to improve the lives of workers, and the trade union assisted the government in doing a lot of work. The trade union has also done a lot of work in improving dormitories, canteens, medical and health care, and nurseries. This work has encouraged the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. The development of the advanced producer movement in 1956 was closely related to the improvement of workers' lives. Through the work of improving the lives of workers, many cadres who did not originally know that workers had difficulties in their lives have paid attention to the difficulties in the lives of workers, and changed the thinking of some cadres who only cared about production and did not care about the lives of workers. However, there are also certain shortcomings in this work, mainly that it did not pay attention to mobilizing the masses' own strength to solve the difficulties in life, and ideological education work was also not done well enough. Therefore, a small number of workers cannot correctly understand the issue of improving their lives, resulting in excessively high demands on life.

　　The meeting believes that in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the welfare work of workers should also be in line with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy. The trade union should mobilize the masses to use their own strength to solve the difficulties in life. However, necessary welfare facilities cannot be reduced because of advocating economy. The meeting criticized the idea of some people who attempted to reduce indispensable welfare facilities in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and pointed out that doing so would damage the production enthusiasm of the workers.

　　This meeting decided to convene the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions and stipulated the number of delegates and election methods for the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions.

　　Chairman Lai Ruoyu made a work report on the first day of the meeting, and later, he made a summary of the meeting.

　　全国总工会执委会召开扩大会议
　　讨论在企业中加强群众监督问题
　　决定今年召开工会第八次全国代表大会
    新华社21日讯　中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会第五次全体会议（扩大）在今天闭幕。这次会议是从3月14日开始的。
    这次会议着重讨论了在企业中加强群众监督问题。这个问题是根据党的八次全国代表大会决议，在我国进入社会主义建设时期以后，需要进一步扩大国内民主生活，开展反对官僚主义斗争的精神提出的。会议认为在企业中加强群众监督，就是贯彻执行党的群众路线，吸引群众参加企业管理。而召开职工代表大会乃是吸引群众参加企业管理的好方法。在加强群众监督、扩大企业民主管理制度的同时，必须加强工会工作。工会各工作委员会的工作和工会小组的工作，应该与贯彻执行职工代表大会的决议结合起来，以便通过工会各工作委员会和工会小组的工作，使职工代表大会制度更加巩固。
    会议认为，工会要真正代表群众利益，首先在工会内部必须充分发扬民主，反对官僚主义作风，把工会工作放在群众监督之下。工会处处都要以诱导的方法在群众中进行工作，在选举活动中，不能因为保证某人当选，而采取强迫办法；工会小组会议，应该成为群众发表意见的场所；工会的财务必须公开。
    会议在回顾1956年工作的时候，认为1956年工会着重做了两项工作，一是开展先进生产者运动，一是协助政府进行工资改革和职工生活福利工作。
    去年全国各地热烈地开展了先进生产者运动，同过去的劳动竞赛比较，去年先进生产者运动中的各项工作是比较深入细致的，一度认为是严重缺点的竞赛中的形式主义，已经有了很大改变；群众在竞赛中，更多的表现了团结和互助；一直被认为是竞赛中死角的科室人员，去年也参加到运动中来了。缺点是执行先进生产者运动的方针：多、快、好、省不够全面，一般只求多、快，忽视了好、省。因此，很多厂矿质量和成本指标完成得不够好，安全也注意不够。少数地区运动没有持续下去，只热闹了一阵便消沉下去了。
    去年的工资改革，是政府改善职工生活的一项重大措施，工会协助政府做了很多工作。在改善宿舍、食堂、医疗卫生及托儿所等各项工作中，工会也做了很多事情。这些工作鼓舞了广大职工群众的生产热情。1956年先进生产者运动的开展，同改善职工生活有很大关系。通过改善职工生活的工作，并使许多原来不知道职工生活有困难的干部重视了职工生活中的困难问题，改变了一些干部只顾生产不关心职工生活的思想。但是，在这个工作中，也存在着某些缺点，主要是没有注意发动群众自己的力量来解决生活中的困难问题，思想教育工作也做得很不够。因此，有少数职工不能正确认识改善生活问题，以致产生了对生活的过高要求。
    会议认为，在增产节约运动中，职工生活福利工作，也应该符合增产节约精神，工会应该发动群众用自己的力量来解决生活困难问题，但是，必需的生活福利设施不能因为提倡节约而削减。会议批判了某些人企图在增产节约运动中削减必不可少的生活福利设施的思想，指出，这样做的结果，将会损害职工群众的生产积极性。
    这次会议决定召开中国工会第八次全国代表大会，并规定了中国工会第八次全国代表大会代表名额和选举办法。
    赖若愚主席在会议的第一天作了工作报告，后来，他又作了会议的总结。
