    Shanxi to Build and Expand Four Iron Plants
    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, March 14th. Shanxi Province will build and expand four small-scale iron plants with minimal investment and refurbished equipment.
    In Shouyang, Yuxian, Ningwu, Wutai and other places rich in iron ore, technicians are surveying and designing three new small-scale iron plants. These three iron plants are all located near railway lines and main highways. The plant sites have existing foundations for smelting iron and steel, and these iron plants can be equipped with old and refurbished iron smelting blast furnaces. These plants can start production in the fourth quarter of this year and early next year.
    The Guxian Iron Plant in the Shangdang Basin of the Taihang Mountains has been transformed and equipped with many old equipment unsuitable for state-owned steel plants in recent years, and has now become a factory with ironmaking, steelmaking, and steel rolling equipment. This year, the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Production Cooperatives, and the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry jointly invested in building a small-scale iron smelting furnace with an annual output of nearly 30,000 tons. Due to the full use of local resources and existing equipment, the total investment of this small blast furnace is only one-tenth of the cost of building a new blast furnace of the same scale, and it can start production in October this year.
    According to estimates by relevant departments of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry, after all these plants are put into production, they will be able to supply the steel raw materials for dozens of local machine factories and repair shops in the province, and can also supply state-owned factories and handicraft factories with a considerable amount of steel castings.

    山西新建扩建四个铁厂
    新华社太原14日电  山西省将以极少的投资和改装的设备新建和扩建四座小型炼铁厂。
    在铁矿丰富的寿阳、盂县、宁武、五台等地，技术人员正在勘测和设计三座新的小型炼铁厂。这三座炼铁厂都在铁路沿线和公路干线附近。厂址附近都有冶炼钢铁的基础，这些炼铁厂可以利用旧有的和改装以后的炼铁高炉装备起来。这些厂在今年第四季度和明年初就可以生产。
    太行山区上党盆地的故县铁厂，经过近年来的改造和安装许多国营钢铁厂不适用的旧设备以后，现在已经成为拥有炼铁、炼钢和压延钢材设备的工厂。今年，煤炭工业部、全国手工业生产联合社筹备委员会和山西省工业厅共同投资在这里又新建一个年产近三万吨的小型炼铁炉。由于充分运用当地资源和现有设备，这个小型炼铁炉的全部投资仅为新建同样规模高炉的十分之一，并且在今年10月份就能开始生产。
    据山西省工业厅有关部门估计，这些厂全部投入生产以后，就能供应全省几十个地方机器厂和修配厂的钢铁原料，并且还能供给国营工厂、手工业工厂相当数量的钢铁铸件。
