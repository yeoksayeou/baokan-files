    "The Emperor's New Clothes"
    Yang Xianyi
    Many famous European fairy tales are adapted from ancient folk legends; but many of Andersen's fairy tales are his own creations, including "The Emperor's New Clothes," which tells the story of an ancient king who wanted the finest materials to make clothes, and as a result, the weavers made him clothes that were completely empty, which he was very proud of. This is a satirical masterpiece. In fact, long before Andersen's work appeared, there was a similar fable in ancient oriental legends, and the former may have been adapted from the latter.
    An ancient Chinese book of biographies, "Biographies of Eminent Monks," contains a biography of the eminent monk Kumarajiva, which mentions that when he was young, he met the Kashmir monk Bandhudatta. Kumarajiva believed in the "Mahayana" school of Buddhism, while Bandhudatta believed in "Hinayana." The two began a debate, and Bandhudatta quoted "The Emperor's New Clothes" to illustrate that what Kumarajiva believed in was really empty. "Soon after, the master Bandhudatta arrived from not far away... The master said to Kumarajiva, 'In Mahayana, what different aspects do you see that you want to admire it?' Kumarajiva said, 'Mahayana is profound and pure, explaining that all dharmas are empty; Hinayana is biased and limited, clinging to names and forms.' The master said, 'Your saying that everything is empty is very frightening; why abandon the existence of dharma and love emptiness? It is like the madman of old who ordered the weaver to weave cotton, demanding the finest possible quality. The weaver put in extra effort, making it as fine as dust, but the madman still complained that it was coarse. The weaver, greatly angered, pointed to the empty space and said, "This is the fine thread." The madman said, "Why can't I see it?" The master said, "This thread is extremely fine. Even I, a skilled craftsman, cannot see it, let alone others?" The madman was overjoyed and gave it to the weaver, who also pretended to weave, and both received high rewards, but in reality, there was nothing there. Your emptiness dharma is also like this.'"
    This story says that a madman ordered a weaver to weave cloth, and although it was as fine as dust, he still complained that it was too coarse. As a result, he was fooled, and the weaver was rewarded. This is exactly the same as what Andersen said. If it is a coincidence, then it is too strange a coincidence.
    Kumarajiva was born in Kucha in 344 AD, the second year of the Jianyuan era of the Eastern Jin Dynasty. At the age of nine, he went to Kashmir in the Western Regions, where he met the disciple of the King of Kashmir, the famous monk Bandhudatta. Since this fable was told by Bandhudatta, it must have existed at least in the fourth century and had been introduced to China by the early sixth century, a thousand years earlier than Andersen's fairy tale.

    “国王的新衣”
    杨宪益
    欧洲许多著名童话故事都是根据古代民间传说改写的；但安徒生的童话有不少是自己创作的，其中“国王的新衣”，说古代有一个国王要最精细的材料做衣服，结果织工给他做了一件空无所有的衣服，他倒非常得意。这是一篇讽刺杰作。其实，早在安徒生的这篇作品出现以前，在古代东方寓言中，也有同样的一篇，可能前者就是根据后者改编的。
    我国古代一部纪载佛教高僧事迹的名著“高僧传”里有一篇关于高僧鸠摩罗什的传记，里面提到他年轻时遇到罽宾高僧盘头达多，鸠摩罗什相信佛教的“大乘”派别，盘头达多相信“小乘”，两人就展开了辩论，结果盘头达多就引了“国王的新衣”这一则寓言来说明鸠摩罗什所相信的实在是空无所有的东西。“俄而大师盘头达多不远而至……师谓什曰：汝于大乘，见何异相，而欲尚之？什曰：大乘深净，明有法皆空；小乘偏局，多滞名相。师曰：汝说一切皆空，甚可畏也；安舍有法，而爱空乎？如昔狂人，令绩师绩绵，极令细好，绩师加意，细若微尘，狂人犹恨其粗；绩师大怒，乃指空示曰：此是细缕。狂人曰：何以不见？师曰：此缕极细，我工之良匠，犹且不见，况他人耶？狂人大喜，以付绩师，师亦效焉，皆蒙上赏，而实无物。汝之空法，亦由此也”。
    这段故事说狂人命令绩师织布，虽然细若微尘，还嫌太粗，结果上了当，绩师倒受了奖赏，完全同安徒生所说的一模一样，如果说是偶然巧合，那就巧合得太奇怪了。
    鸠摩罗什于纪元344年，东晋建元二年，生于龟兹，九岁时到西域的罽宾国，也就是今天的迦湿弥尔；在那里遇到罽宾王徒弟，著名高僧盘头达多。这个寓言既是盘头达多说的，那至晚在四世纪里业已存在，至晚在六世纪初年已经传入中国，比安徒生童话早了一千几百年了。
