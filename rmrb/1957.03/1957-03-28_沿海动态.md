　　Coastal Dynamics
　　Zhejiang Fishermen and Farmers Raise Razor Clams and Blood Clams
　　This newspaper reports that the coastal areas of Zhejiang Province are currently in the season for raising shellfish such as razor clams, blood clams, and oysters. Every day, thousands of farmers or fishermen are working diligently on the mudflats (the muddy areas by the sea, locally called "haitu"), catching and washing razor clam and blood clam seedlings, preparing the mudflats, and actively making preparations for stocking. This year, the razor clam seedlings are growing vigorously, sufficient to meet the needs of the province. According to the plans of production cooperatives in various regions, the total stocking area in the province will reach 58,000 mu, an increase of more than 20,000 mu compared to 1956.
　　Mudflat aquaculture has low costs, high yields, and large income, and is an important sideline for agricultural and fishing cooperatives in coastal areas. In Xidian Township, Ninghai County, the entire township stocks oysters on 1,047 mu, with an average income of 600 yuan per laborer. In Yueqing County, the income from mudflat aquaculture is equivalent to an average of two or three mu of paddy fields per mu. Razor clams, blood clams, oysters, and other shellfish are highly nutritious non-staple foods; dried razor clams are also sold abroad.
　　The province has a long coastline, many harbors, and a vast area of mudflats. Shellfish resources are very abundant. This year's stocking area only accounts for one-eighth of the province's available mudflats.

　　Fujian Trials Kelp Cultivation
　　This newspaper reports that Fujian Province has achieved success in its first trial cultivation of kelp. Last October, the Fujian Aquatic Products Bureau transported more than 20,000 kelp seedlings from Qingdao and used a raft-type artificial cultivation method to trial cultivate them in the outer sea area of Xiaocheng Changwan, Lianjiang County, where the water depth is five to six meters. After two to three months of cultivation, these seedlings have grown into kelp over one meter long, with a brownish-yellow color. According to observations, the kelp can grow two or three centimeters per day, and the growth is rapid, indicating that there is great potential for developing kelp cultivation in the coastal areas of Fujian.

　  浙江渔民农民放养蛏蚶
    本报讯　浙江省沿海地区目前正是蛏、蚶、牡蛎等贝类的放养季节。每天海涂（海边的烂泥，当地称为“海涂”）上成千上万的农民或渔民，进行着紧张劳动，捉洗蛏、蚶幼苗，整理涂地，积极做好准备放养工作。今年蛏苗生长旺盛，足够供应该省需要。根据各地生产社的计划，全省放养面积达五万八千亩，比1956年增加二万余亩。
    海涂养殖，成本低，产量高，收入大，是沿海农、渔业社一项重要副业。宁海县西垫乡，全乡放养牡蛎一千零四十七亩，每个劳力平均收入六百元。乐清县海涂养殖的收入，每亩平均相等于二、三亩水稻田。蛏、蚶、牡蛎等贝类是营养价值很高的副食品；蛏干还销售国外。
    该省海岸线长，港湾多，海涂面积广阔，贝类资源非常丰富，今年放养面积，还仅占全省可利用的海涂八分之一。

    福建试养海带
    本报讯　福建省首次试养海带已有成效。去年10月，福建水产局在青岛运回二万多棵海带幼苗，采用竹筏式的人工养殖方法，试养在连江县小埕长?湾水深五——六公尺的外海地方。经过两、三个月的养育，这些幼苗已经长成呈褐黄颜色一公尺以上的海带了。据观察，海带每日可生长二、三公分，生长迅速，说明福建沿海大有发展海带养殖的前途。　（黄祖源）
