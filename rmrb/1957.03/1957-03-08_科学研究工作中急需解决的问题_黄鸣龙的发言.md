    Problems urgently needed to be solved in scientific research work
    Huang Minglong's speech
    I. On the issue of marching towards science
    Since the Party and the government vigorously called for marching towards science last year, demanding to catch up with the world's advanced level within twelve years, and formulated a national twelve-year scientific work plan, the enthusiasm of the intellectual circles, especially the youth, has been greatly encouraged under the influence of this call, and a vigorous atmosphere has emerged in the scientific community. However, certain problems still exist in some aspects, which need to be solved urgently. We cannot always stay or delay at the stage of calls and plans. With plans, we also need to organize and lead their implementation and execution.
    Strict division of labor and mutual cooperation
    First of all, there must be strict division of labor, cooperation, and mutual coordination, which is especially important given China's scientific backwardness and the lack of scientific research personnel. Taking chemistry as an example, it is said that there are only dozens of people in the country who can really do research work, while there are thousands in the Soviet Union and the United States. On the one hand, China has few people, but on the other hand, several units often repeat the same research project at the same time, without division of labor, cooperation, or communication. For example: (1) In the synthesis of isoniazid (Remifon), a drug for treating tuberculosis, it is said that there are more than twenty in Shanghai, and some even say there are eighty, and the newspapers also vigorously promote "Remifon production has begun." In fact, the manufacture of such a relatively simple drug does not require so many units to carry out simultaneous confidential work without communicating with each other. (2) At least five units, including the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other academies, as well as a certain agency in South China, are simultaneously extracting and producing Rauvolfia (snake root), a drug for treating high blood pressure, without communicating with each other. (3) For organophosphorus pesticides for agricultural use, two agricultural scientific institutions in Beijing, the Department of Chemistry of the Shanghai Institute of Medical Sciences, and the Department of Chemistry of Nankai University in Tianjin are all repeating research. There are many similar repetitive phenomena. This is very harmful. China already has so few scientific research personnel, and the same research work has to be repeated by several units. This is a terrible waste of national human and material resources, and it will inevitably affect other important research work that cannot be done, which will seriously affect the implementation of the twelve-year scientific plan. Therefore, with a plan and key points, all scientific research departments and higher education institutions should organize and lead specific divisions of labor, and must cooperate with each other, exchange information, and exchange experience. If a certain work is not done by a certain research unit, the government must organize it.
    Reasonable arrangement of scientific personnel
    Secondly, we must overcome blind arrangements and departmentalism in personnel allocation. China has a frighteningly small number of people who can conduct scientific research, and the scientific tasks are so arduous. Every scientific person should be able to use what they have learned and give full play to their strengths in order to catch up with the world's advanced level. However, some institutions are now backlogged with many scientific personnel who are not currently needed or who are not using what they have learned. They have nothing to do or cannot give full play to their strengths. Of course, these people are depressed, but the organization is unwilling to transfer them to units that urgently need such personnel. Therefore, this terribly small portion of human resources cannot be fully utilized, and is being destroyed. This is a serious loss and waste for the country, and a very serious obstacle to marching towards science and improving academic standards. Therefore, the government should promptly handle, plan, adjust, and rationally allocate what institutions should do, how many and what kind of staff should be there, and how to reasonably arrange and overcome departmentalism.
    The unified assignment system for graduates of colleges and universities implemented since liberation is a correct and reasonable system and a good method. It can send the construction talents cultivated by the hard work of teachers in colleges and universities to the posts where the motherland needs them most, so that materials can be used to their full potential. However, in the past few years, many unreasonable phenomena have appeared in the unified distribution of university graduates. Some chemical engineering graduates were assigned to pharmaceutical research departments, some mineral analysis graduates were assigned to organic synthesis research departments, while pharmaceutical synthesis students were assigned to biological products institutes, and pharmacy students were assigned to do chemical engineering design work. We can find more examples from newspapers and periodicals such as the People's Daily and Guangming Daily, and we can also hear a lot of voices from all sides. So where is the root cause of these errors? I think this is inseparable from bureaucracy and subjectivism in personnel work. Science is developing very fast now, and the division of labor is becoming more and more detailed (for example, Soviet higher education institutions have set up countless majors and specializations), and only the teachers in higher education institutions who cultivate these talents and the professional institutions that use these talents can understand the specific requirements of this division of labor, which cannot be grasped by ordinary personnel cadres. It is precisely because the opinions of teachers in colleges and universities and experts in various fields have not been well respected in the past that many mistakes have been made. It takes more than twenty years of time and immeasurable human and material resources for the state to cultivate a scientific and technological talent. How simple is it! If we are not careful when assigning work, how huge will this loss be! Today, when the Party and the government are calling for increasing production and practicing economy, we should examine the serious waste of the motherland's invaluable treasure—talent—in various agencies.
    Effectively guarantee research time
    Third, to march towards science and catch up with the world's advanced level, we must also vigorously cultivate talents, cultivate talents who can think independently and do research work; we must add necessary instruments and equipment. In addition, we must effectively guarantee that five-sixths of the time is used for professional work. Although various agencies say that they sincerely guarantee five-sixths of the time, the actual situation is not the case. There are many kinds of meetings. For example, recently there will be meetings to discuss increasing production and practicing economy, meetings to evaluate grades and salaries, meetings to discuss annual, five-year, and twelve-year plans, and meetings to evaluate advanced workers. Other celebrations of anniversaries, exhibitions of advanced deeds, and sorting out and inventorying equipment all require meetings. All parties emphasize the importance of each activity and are never willing to reduce or shorten the time, or the time for one aspect is reduced or shortened, while the activities for another aspect are increased or extended, and they are often required to be completed within a limited time, forcing people to work overtime to study or attend meetings. As a result, many scientific researchers cannot settle down in laboratories or research rooms to conduct research and cultivate young people. Some units use evenings and Sundays for meetings, thinking that this will not affect the five-sixths of the time. In fact, this is not the case. A scientific worker, especially a young person, must read a lot of relevant books, magazines, and other materials. They are busy with work during the day and have no time to read, so they can only use the evening time to read and study. Therefore, using evening meetings to guarantee five-sixths of the time does not solve the problem. I think necessary meetings should be organized in a planned way, and the time must be reduced and shortened. Unnecessary meetings should be canceled altogether. Some problems can be solved by notices and other methods, and it is not necessary to hold meetings. In short, it is necessary to effectively guarantee that scientific researchers use five-sixths of their time for professional work, otherwise it will cause immeasurable waste and losses.
    II. On the issue of increasing production and practicing economy
    Increasing production and practicing economy is a code of conduct that everyone should follow, and it is the goal of every upright and progressive citizen's struggle. As the Party and the government have repeatedly called for, we should all work diligently and frugally, and constantly strive to increase production and practice economy. Therefore, increasing production and practicing economy should not be regarded as a temporary activity or treated as a campaign. So why is increasing production and practicing economy put forward as a campaign? I think this is because our motherland's socialist construction requires a lot of funds, and everyone has gradually forgotten the previous days of poverty, hardship, and oppression not long after liberation, and extravagance, ostentation, and waste have appeared in many places. This does require a nationwide campaign.
    Cannot abandon everything for the sake of economy
    However, when carrying out and grasping this campaign, we cannot only talk about saving and forget about increasing production. We must never hinder the development of our cause simply for the sake of saving. The call of the Party and the government also pointed out that the money that must be spent should still be spent, and the money that should not be spent should not be wasted at all. I completely agree with and resolutely support this policy. According to reports, some colleges and universities have vacated rooms in office buildings to use as classrooms and dormitories, which I think is very commendable. I have always felt that people in our country like to build a lot of houses when running politics, schools, factories, and research institutes, and they divide them into many, many departments and institutions. With many departments, many positions naturally have to be set up. Therefore, everywhere there are phenomena of large institutions, redundant structures, and overstaffing. After liberation, this phenomenon has not been eradicated, and thus a style of extravagance and waste has formed. Therefore, it is completely correct to start with streamlining institutions and saving unnecessary expenses to implement economy. But on the other hand, we must not forget that we are building socialism, and we must never abandon everything for the sake of economy and do nothing. If so, it would be like giving up eating for fear of choking. Therefore, increasing production and practicing economy must have principles, must distinguish between primary and secondary, and must distinguish between importance and lightness. Some agencies rigidly limit funding in order to save money, thinking that this will complete the task, but they do not consider that the consequences of doing so may sometimes lead to serious waste of manpower and time. For example, in organic chemistry, it only takes one or two days to identify molecular structures with an infrared spectrometer, but it takes several years without an infrared spectrometer. May I ask, should this kind of money be saved? I think even though foreign exchange is scarce, things that must be bought must still be bought. If an agency does not study molecular structures but buys one to show off, then it should be saved. In short, saving is necessary, but it should be principled.
    Pay attention to saving manpower and talent
    Secondly, what I want to put forward is that we should pay attention to saving manpower and talent. In the past, what we talked about saving mostly focused on money and materials, and rarely talked about saving manpower and talent. I have already talked about the waste caused by improper allocation of graduates from colleges and universities. In fact, there are also various wastes caused by improper use of talent and the dispersion of manpower. In some scientific and technical departments in our country, due to improper arrangements and use, talents often cannot play their role. In our country, where there is such a lack of talent today, it is really a serious waste. Many government agencies and enterprises have set up research institutes or laboratories one after another, regardless of the conditions, which makes the shortage of scientific and technical personnel even more tense. Some places have experts and professors but no assistants, while other places have talented assistants but no experts and professors to lead and train them. Why can't we share what we have and learn from each other in a country? In the past few years, during the adjustment, establishment, or abolition of departments and majors in colleges and universities, some professors and their lecturers and teaching assistants were often separated, supposedly to prevent the growth of sectarianism. I do not agree with this unreasonable statement. We cannot say that Mr. Mei Lanfang and his old partner have been singing together for decades is sectarianism. Soviet friends have repeatedly encouraged us to strive to form our own schools of thought, which is worth our deep consideration in the voice of increasing production, practicing economy, and marching towards science!
    Finally, I will return to the issue of saving to say a few words to illustrate the harm of losing the principle of saving. To catch up with the international scientific level, we must strive to march towards science. In other words, we should start running in scientific work and catch up quickly. However, if saving does not follow principles, resulting in a lack of tools required for research, then not only can we not run, but even slow progress is impossible. Recently, it seems that scientific institutions must uniformly reduce all equipment expenditures (including foreign exchange) no matter what, so research work has felt particularly difficult. For example, chemical research work has to be stopped because the required chemical reagents cannot be purchased; or because the required reagents must be prepared or refined first, or even because the raw materials for preparing the reagents are not available, this raw material must be prepared first, so the research itself has to be temporarily shelved. This is like those who should be building houses having to manufacture bricks, tiles, and wood first; those who should be rushing on the road having to busy themselves paving the road first because there is no road to walk. It seems that problems will occur in marching towards science in this way, hoping to catch up with the international level. (Attached picture)

    科学研究工作中急需解决的问题
    黄鸣龙的发言
    一、关于向科学进军问题
    自从去年党和政府大力号召向科学进军以来，要求在十二年内赶上世界先进水平，并订出了全国十二年科学工作的规划，在这个号召的影响下全国知识界特别是青年的积极性受到了很大的鼓舞，科学界出现了蓬勃的气象。但是在某些方面也还存在着一定的问题，急需解决。我们不能老停留或迟延在号召和计划的阶段，有了计划，还需要有组织有领导地去执行和贯彻。
    严密分工互相配合
    首先，要有严密的分工合作和互相配合，特别是我国的科学落后，在科学研究人员很缺乏的情况下就尤其重要。就以化学方面来讲，全国真能做研究工作者据说只有几十个人，在苏联和美国都有几千人才。我国一方面人少，而另一方面却又往往是几个单位同时重复进行同一项目的研究，既不分工，又不合作，相互之间也不通声气。例如：（1）合成治肺结核的异烟肼（雷米风）的，据说在上海就有二十几家，有的还说有八十家，报上也大肆宣传“做起雷米风来了”。事实上这样一个较简单的药物的制造，根本用不到这么多单位互不通消息同时保密的进行。（2）治高血压的萝芙藤（蛇根草），现在至少有中国科学院及其他科学院以及华南某机关等五个单位同时互不通消息地在进行提制。（3）农业用的杀虫的有机磷制剂，北京有二个农业科学机关，上海医学科学院化学系，天津南开大学化学系等都在重复地进行研究。诸如此类的重复现象很多。这是非常有害的，中国的科学研究人员已经这么少了，而同一个研究工作还要让几个单位重复进行，这是国家人力物力极可怕的浪费，并且必然会影响到另外若干重要研究工作得不到人去做，这就会严重地影响了十二年科学规划的实施。所以有了规划，有了重点，各个科学研究部门及各高等院校还应该有组织地有领导地进行具体的分工，必须互相配合，互通消息和交流经验。某一工作如不是某一研究单位所做的，就必须要政府来组织进行。
    合理安排科学人员
    其次，必须克服人员分配上的盲目安排和本位主义。中国能进行科学研究的人员已经少得可怕，科学任务又这么艰巨，应该使每个科学人员都能学以致用和发挥所长，这样才有可能赶上世界先进水平。可是现在有些机关中积压了许多目前不需要的或用非所学的科学人员，他们无事可做，或不能发挥所长。当然这种人沉闷不堪，可是组织上又不肯把他们调到目前急需这样人员的单位，因此这一部分少得可怕的人力非但不能充分发挥，并受到摧残，这是国家严重的损失及浪费，对于向科学进军和提高学术水平是一个极严重的障碍。所以什么机构应该做什么工作，应有多少什么样的工作人员，如何地合理安排和克服本位主义，政府也应该从速处理，有计划地调整和合理地分配。
    解放以来所实行的大专学校毕业生统一分配制度，本是一个正确和合理的制度，也是一个好的办法。它可以把大专学校教师辛勤劳碌地培养出来的建设人才送到祖国最需要的岗位上去，使得材尽其用。然而过去几年在统一分配大学毕业生时却出现了很多不合理现象，有的化工毕业生被分配在药物研究部门，有的矿物分析专修科毕业生被分配在有机合成的研究部门，而学药物合成的则被分配到生物制品所去，学药学的被分配去做化工设计工作。我们可以从人民日报、光明日报等报刊里找到更多的事例，也可以从各方面听到很多的呼声。然则这些错误的根源在那里呢？我想这是和人事工作中的官僚主义、主观主义分不开的。现在的科学发展得很快，分工已愈来愈细（像苏联的高等院校中就设了无数的专业和专门化），而这种分工的具体要求只有培养这些人才的高等院校教师和使用这种人才的专业机构才能了解，决不是一般人事干部所能掌握。正因为过去没有很好地尊重高等院校教师们和各专业的专家们的意见，以致铸成很多错误。国家培养一个科学技术人才要花费二十几年的光阴，还有无法估计的人力和物力，多么不简单啊！如果在分配工作的时候不慎重处理，这笔损失又是多么浩大啊！在党和政府号召增产节约的今天，我们应该检查各机关在对祖国无价的财宝——人才方面的严重浪费。
    切实保证研究时间
    第三、要向科学进军和赶上世界先进水平，还必须大力培养人才，培养能独立思考做研究工作的人才；必须添补必要的仪器和设备。此外，还必须切实保证六分之五的时间用于业务。现在各个机关虽说要诚心诚意地保证六分之五的时间，但实际情形并不如此，各种各样的会议很多。如最近讨论增产节约要开会，评级评薪也要开会，讨论全年、五年、十二年计划又要开会，评选先进工作者又要开会，他如庆祝周年纪念、先进事迹展览、整理清点器材等等都要开会。各方面都强调每一个活动的重要性，从不肯减少或缩短时间，或一方面的时间减少了、缩短了，而另一方面的活动又增加了、延长了，并且常常还限时完成，以致逼得加班加点地学习或开会。因此许多科学研究人员就不能在实验室或研究室里安定下来进行研究和培养青年的工作。有的单位利用晚上及星期日开会，以为这样就可不影响六分之五的时间了。其实不然，一个科学工作人员特别是青年，必须要看许多有关的书籍杂志等等资料，白天忙于工作没有时间看，只有利用晚上时间阅读和学习。所以借晚上开会来保证六分之五，这还是不解决问题的。我认为必要的会议应有计划地加以组织，必须减少和缩短时间，没有必要的会议，干脆取消；有些问题可用通知等方式解决，不一定要召开会议。总之，切实地保证科学研究人员六分之五的时间用于业务是必要的，否则将造成不可估量的浪费和损失。
  二、关于增产节约的问题
    增产节约是每一个人应该奉行的守则，它是每一个正直的进步的公民奋斗的目标。正如党和政府一再号召的，要我们大家勤俭办事，要经常地努力增产和节约，所以增产节约不应看作是一个暂时性的活动，当作运动来搞。那么为什么增产节约又作为一个运动提出来呢？我想这是因为我们祖国的社会主义建设需要大量的资金，而解放不久大家已渐渐忘记了以前贫苦艰难受欺压的日子，在很多地方出现了奢侈浮华、铺张浪费的现象。这确需要开展一个全国规模的运动。
    不能因节约而百兴俱废
    但是在开展和掌握这个运动时却不能只讲节约而忘记了增产。绝不能单纯为了节约而妨碍了事业的发展。党和政府的号召也指出，必需用的钱还是应该花，不应该用的钱则分文不应该浪费。我完全同意并坚决拥护这个政策方针。报载有些高等学校腾出办公楼的房子来做教室和宿舍，我想这是很值得提倡的。我一直觉得我国的人，办政治、办学校、办厂、办研究所都喜欢造很多的房子，分了很多很多的部门和机构，有了很多部门就自然要设立很多职位，因此到处都是机构庞大、重床叠屋和人浮于事的现象。解放以后，这种现象并未得到根除，因此就形成了铺张浪费的风气。所以从精简机构和节约不必要的开支入手来贯彻节约，是完全正确的。但是在另一方面我们却不能忘记我们是在建设社会主义，绝不能因为节约的缘故而百兴俱废，什么事也不干了。如果这样，那就等于因噎废食。所以搞增产节约必须有原则，必须分主次，必须分轻重。有些机关为了节约就硬性限制经费，以为这样能完成任务，却没有顾到这样做的后果有时反会导致人力和时间上的严重浪费。例如有机化学上用红外线光谱仪鉴定分子结构，只需要一二天的时间所能完成的工作，如不用红外线光谱仪就要花好几年。试问这种钱应不应该节约呢？我认为尽管外汇很少，必须买的还是要买。假如在一个机关里，并不研究分子结构而买一架来摆摆排场，那就应该节约。总之节约是必要的，但应有原则。
    注意节约人力人才
    其次我想提出的，是应注意人力与人才上的节约。我们过去所谈的节约多侧重在钱和物质方面，很少谈到人力和人才的节约。前面我已谈到在大专学校毕业生分配不当上所造成的浪费，实际上还有人才使用不当和人力分散所造成的种种浪费。在我国的有些科学和技术部门里由于安排使用不当，往往有人才而不能发挥作用，在我国人才这样缺乏的今天，实在是一个严重的浪费。很多政府机关和企业部门不问条件如何，纷纷各自设立研究所或化验室，就使得科学技术人员的缺乏情况更加紧张。有的地方有了专家教授却没有助手，有的地方助手人才倒有，却没有专家教授领导和培养。为什么在一个国家里不能互通有无，截长补短呢？过去几年在高等学校的院系调整和专业设置或废除时，往往把一些教授和他们的讲师助教等分开，据说是为了防止宗派主义的滋长。我不同意这种不合理的说法，我们不能说梅兰芳先生和他的老搭当在一起唱了几十年戏就是宗派主义。苏联朋友们一再鼓励我们要努力形成自己的学派，在增产节约和科学进军声中是值得我们深思熟虑的！
    最后我再回到节约问题上说几句话，说明节约失去原则之害，我们要赶上国际科学水平，必须努力向科学进军。换句话说我们进行科学工作应开始跑步，急起直追。但是如果节约不守原则，致使进行研究所需工具缺乏，则非但不能跑步，就连缓步前进都不可能。最近科学机构似乎无论如何各项器材开支（包括外汇）都须一律削减，因此研究工作上已感到格外困难。例如，化学研究工作因所需化学药品不能购买，只好停止进行；或因所需药品必须先行制备或先行精制，甚或因制备药品的原料也没有，更须先行制备这种原料，因此研究本身的工作不得不暂行搁置。这好比应进行建筑房屋者，须先制造砖瓦木料；应赶路者因无路可走须先忙铺路。如此向科学进军，希望赶上国际水平，似乎要发生问题。（附图片）
