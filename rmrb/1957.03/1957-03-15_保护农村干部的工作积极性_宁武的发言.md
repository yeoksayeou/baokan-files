I completely agree with and support the reports made to the Congress by Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. I especially express my great admiration for Premier Zhou's visit abroad, working hard for the country, lasting three months, traveling 100,000 miles, and making outstanding contributions to strengthening international unity and cooperation. Premier Zhou's humble and sincere attitude during his visits abroad is especially worthy of our study.

The first year of China's basic completion of the socialist transformation has passed. During this year, tremendous changes have taken place in all aspects of the country. However, people have different feelings and views on socialist transformation and the socialist system. There are correct views and incorrect views. What is the correct view? I think we should first see the superiority of the socialist system and affirm our achievements in socialist transformation and socialist construction. The growth of industrial and agricultural production, the development of cultural and educational undertakings, and even the changes in people's revolutionary moral concepts and social customs all illustrate this point. However, building socialism is a new undertaking, and we have no experience, and the time is short, so it is inevitable that some shortcomings and deviations will occur. It is very necessary to check and criticize these shortcomings so that the work can be continuously improved. However, we should not ignore the achievements of the work and simply criticize the shortcomings. If we do so, it will easily dampen the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses, which will not only fail to promote the advancement of the socialist cause, but will also have the opposite effect. Now I will take the agricultural cooperation in Liaoning Province as an example:

Excessive Criticism and Blame Will Not Benefit the Work

Our Liaoning Province basically realized advanced cooperation in the spring of last year, with 92.8% of farmers joining advanced cooperatives. With cooperation and the relatively normal weather last year, agricultural production achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The total grain output increased by 23% compared with 1955, and the total cotton output doubled. More than 85% of agricultural cooperatives in the province increased production, and more than 80% of cooperative members increased their income. All this shows that cooperation has demonstrated its superiority and that the cooperatives have been successfully run. However, even in this situation, in some places last winter, cadres and the masses experienced some low morale, which affected winter production not being very good. What was going on? As Chairman Mao often said, everything has two aspects. Cooperatives have demonstrated their superiority, increased production, and increased income, which is the basic aspect; on the other hand, the vast majority of cooperatives were only established for one year, and everyone has no experience, so it is inevitable that some deviations will occur, but this is a secondary aspect. The vast number of rural cadres correctly implemented the Party's policies and worked actively and hard, and the achievements made in the work are the main aspect; however, some cadres also have subjectivism, bureaucratism, and coercive orders, turning some good things into bad things, which is another aspect of the work. Some of us do not look at the problem this way, only picking faults, not affirming achievements, and excessively criticizing and blaming shortcomings, even describing the cadres below as a complete mess. This kind of evaluation is not only inconsistent with the facts, but also very easy to dampen the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses, making them feel that "they have worked hard for a year, and as a result, they have been blamed," so how can they not have low morale? Fortunately, this situation was discovered by the Central Committee in a timely manner and made clear instructions, which have been corrected. Especially around the Spring Festival, a widespread propaganda movement was carried out in rural areas. Currently, the morale of rural cadres and the masses is very high, and they are trying every means to strive for another comprehensive bumper harvest this year. However, this incident should teach us many useful lessons. Chairman Mao said: "New things develop in the struggle with old things." As revolutionaries, we must actively support the growth of new things and not pour cold water on them or打击 them. After the socialist transformation, all social strata have various reactions to socialism. We should first listen more to the opinions and reflections of the strata that support socialism (mainly poor and lower-middle peasants in rural areas) to avoid losing our way. Shortcomings and errors in the work should be criticized and corrected, but criticisms should be carried out realistically while affirming achievements, so as to achieve the purpose of both protecting the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses and correcting shortcomings and improving work.

Suggesting that relevant central departments hand over surplus houses and transportation in Liaoning Province to local authorities for reallocation; suggesting that the central government take measures to appropriately resolve the marriage problems of male workers in heavy industrial cities

Below are two suggestions to the relevant central departments:

1.  The industrial cities in Liaoning Province are developing rapidly, and the shortage of urban housing and transportation is increasing. According to our understanding, some central departments' resident agencies occupy more houses. For example, some departments have several idle sanatoriums in Dalian. Because they are not used, white mold has grown on the floors and sofas. The factories and mines under the central industrial ministries also own a large number of vehicles. If these houses and vehicles can be reallocated by local organizations, it will save the country a lot of financial expenditure. I think this is in line with the Central Committee's spirit of increasing production and practicing economy. It is suggested that the relevant central departments adopt this suggestion and issue a notice to their subordinate units to facilitate local authorities to handle the matter.

2.  Liaoning Province has many heavy industrial cities and mines, generally with more male workers and fewer female workers. For many years, the marriage problem of workers has been difficult to solve. In the past year or two, due to the rapid increase in the development of factories and mines and the increase in employees, this contradiction has become increasingly prominent. Although more rural girls are willing to find workers in cities as their partners, the number is not only small and does not meet the requirements, but it is also easy to cause rural young men to be uneasy about rural production due to not being able to find partners, blindly flowing to cities, and will also affect the normal relationship between workers and peasants. Therefore, I suggest that the central government consider establishing some light industrial factories around heavy industrial cities and mines, specializing in recruiting young female workers to solve this contradiction. Since our province has always had more men than women, and in recent years, many single young men have been recruited and assigned to factories and mines from within the customs, plus there are many unmarried junior officers of the local garrison, if they all strive to find partners locally, it will inevitably cause conflicts with farmers. Therefore, it is best for the central government to recruit these young female workers in a planned manner from provinces within the customs with more women. For the sake of population adjustment, for the sake of caring for the lives of workers and peasants, and for the sake of increasing production morale, please the central government give it consideration.

### 保护农村干部的工作积极性  宁武的发言

    保护农村干部的工作积极性
    宁武的发言
    我完全同意并拥护周恩来总理、陈叔通副主席向大会所做的报告。我特别对这一次周总理出国访问，为国宣劳，历时三个月，行程十万里，在增强国际间的团结合作方面，作出了卓越贡献，表示极大的敬佩。对周总理在国外访问所持的谦虚而诚恳的态度，尤其值得我们学习。
    我国基本完成社会主义改造的第一年已经过去了。这一年中间，国内各方面都起了巨大的变化。但是人们对社会主义改造和社会主义制度却有着不同的感觉和不同的看法。这里面有正确的看法，也有不正确的看法。什么是正确的看法呢？我觉得应该首先看到社会主义制度的优越性。肯定我们在社会主义改造和社会主义建设中的成绩。这一年来，工农业生产的增长，文化教育事业的发展，乃至人们革命道德观念社会风气的变化，都足以说明这一点。但是建设社会主义，这是一项新的事业，我们没有经验，而且时间又短，所以就发生一些缺点和偏差，也是在所难免的。检查、批评这些缺点，使工作得到不断的改进，这是十分必要的。但是我们却不应该不看工作成绩，单纯指责工作缺点。如果这样做，就容易挫伤干部、群众的积极性，不仅不会推动社会主义事业的前进，反而会发生与此相反的副作用。现在我以辽宁省的农业合作化为例：
    过分的批评指责对工作不会有好处
    我们辽宁省在去年春天就基本上实现了高级合作化，加入高级合作社的农户占总农户的92.8％。有了合作化，再加上去年天时比较正常，所以农业生产获得了空前的大丰收。粮食总产量比1955年提高了23％，棉花总产量提高了一倍。全省85％以上的农业社增了产，80％以上社员增加了收入。这一切都说明合作化显示了优越性，合作社办得是成功的。但是就在这种情况下，去年冬天在有些地方还一度发生了干部和群众情绪有些低落，影响冬季生产搞得不大好。这是怎么一回事情呢？原来正像毛主席所常说的，什么事都有两方面，合作社显示了优越性，提高了生产，增加了收入，这是基本的一方面；另一方面是绝大多数合作社才成立一年，大家都没有经验，所以就难免发生一些偏差，但这是次要的一方面。广大农村干部正确执行了党的方针政策，积极努力的工作，工作中获得的成绩是主要的一方面；但是有些干部也存在主观主义、官僚主义、强迫命令的作风，把有些好事办成了坏事，这又是工作的另一方面。我们有些人不这样看问题，专挑毛病，不肯定成绩，过分的指责批评缺点，甚至把下面干部说成一塌糊涂。这样一种评价，不但不符合事实，而且极容易挫伤干部、群众的积极性，使他们感到“辛辛苦苦一年，结果落了一身不是”，这那有情绪不低落的？这种情况幸而被中央及时发现，做了明确指示，已经纠正过来，特别是春节前后，在农村中开展了广泛的宣传运动，目前农村干部和群众情绪都很高涨，正在想尽一切办法，为争取今年再来一个全面大丰收而努力。不过从这件事应该使我们吸取许多有益的教训。毛主席讲：“新事物都是和旧事物斗争中发展起来的”。我们做一个革命者，就要积极扶持新事物的生长，而不要向它泼冷水，打击它。社会主义改造后，社会各阶层对社会主义有各种不同的反映，我们应该首先更多的听取支持社会主义阶层的意见反映（在农村中主要是贫农、下中农），才会免得使我们迷失方向。对工作中的缺点错误，是要提出批评纠正的，但是应该在肯定成绩的同时，实事求是的进行批评，才会达到既保护干部、群众的积极性，又能改正缺点提高工作的目的。
    建议中央有关部门把在辽宁省的多余房屋和交通工具交给当地调剂使用；建议中央采取措施，使重工业城市男职工的婚姻问题得到适当解决
    下面是向中央有关部门提出的两点建议：
    一、辽宁省几个工业城市发展很快，城市住房和交通工具不敷需用的情况日益增加。据我们了解，有些中央部门的驻在机关占用有较多的房屋，如有的部门在大连空闲了几所休养所，因为没有使用，地板沙发上都长了白毛。中央几个工业部所属的厂矿也拥有很大数量的交通工具。如果能把这些房屋和交通工具，由地方组织调剂使用，就会为国家节省很大一笔财政开支，我想这是合乎中央增产节约精神的。建议中央各有关部门能采纳这个意见，并对所属单位下达通知，使地方好去办事。
    二、辽宁省的重工业城市、矿山较多，一般都是男工多、女工少，多年来，工人的结婚问题就很难解决。最近一、二年来，因为工矿发展，职工增加很快，这种矛盾越来越显得突出。虽然目前农村姑娘愿意到城市里找工人为对象，但是不仅数量不多，达不到要求，而且容易引起农村男青年因找不到对象而不安于农村生产，盲目往城市流，还会影响工农联盟的正常关系。因此，我建议，中央考虑在重工业城市、矿山的周围，最好建立一些轻工业工厂，专招收青年女工来解决这一矛盾。由于我省历来就是男多女少，几年来由关内招聘和分配去厂矿工作的单身男青年又很多，再加上当地驻军下级军官未结婚的也很多，如果都就地争取，势必和农民发生矛盾。所以，这种青年女工最好由中央从关内妇女较多的省份有计划的招收才好。为了人口的调剂，为了照顾工人农民的生活，为了增加生产情绪，请中央予以考虑。
