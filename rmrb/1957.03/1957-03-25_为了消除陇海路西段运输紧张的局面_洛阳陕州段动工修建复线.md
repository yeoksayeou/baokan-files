Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, March 24th: Following the commencement of the double-tracking project between Zhengzhou and Luoyang on the Longhai Railway, the key projects on the Luoyang-Shanzhou section – the Xiashe Tunnel and the roadbed construction between Mianchi and Yinghao – also began construction in the first half of March. At the east and west entrances of the 1,806-meter-long Xiashe Tunnel, more than 500 workers are working on the earth and stone excavation outside the tunnel. This tunnel is expected to be completed in about two years.

The Luoyang-Shanzhou section of the railway is 141 kilometers long and is a rare steep gradient restricted section on the national railway network. The new double-track railway project is extremely challenging. After the completion of this double track, the entire section will be able to increase its traction capacity from the current 1,800 tons pulled by two or three locomotives to over 2,400 tons pulled by only two locomotives. The throughput capacity on the Longhai Line will also increase from the current 26 pairs of trains per day to 40 pairs of trains. This will effectively eliminate the existing transportation bottlenecks on the western section of the Longhai Railway.

　　为了消除陇海路西段运输紧张的局面
　　洛阳陕州段动工修建复线
    新华社郑州24日电　继陇海铁路郑州——洛阳间的复线工程动工兴建以后，洛阳到陕州段复线的重点工程——硖石隧道和渑池到英豪间的路基工程，又在3月上半月内先后开工。在长达一千八百零六公尺的硖石隧道的东西洞口，五百多名工人正在做洞外土石方工程。这座隧道将用两年左右的时间修成。
    洛阳——陕州段铁路全长一百四十一公里，是全国铁路中少见的大坡道限制区段，新建复线铁路工程是异常艰巨的。这段复线修成以后，全段将由现在的利用两台机车或三台机车牵引一千八百吨改为只用两台机车牵引二千四百吨以上。陇海线上的通过能力也将由每天通过二十六对列车提高到四十对列车。这将有效地消除陇海西段目前存在的运输紧张的局面。
