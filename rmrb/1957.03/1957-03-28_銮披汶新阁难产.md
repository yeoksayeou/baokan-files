　　Phibun's New Cabinet Still Not Produced
    Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, March 27th: According to Thai newspapers, Phibun, who was re-appointed as Prime Minister, is encountering difficulties in organizing a new cabinet, and the list of the new cabinet, originally scheduled to be announced on March 21, has been delayed.
    According to newspaper reports, the internal disagreement within the Seri Manangkasila Party on the selection of cabinet members is the main difficulty faced by Phibun. It is said that Phibun intends to include other pro-government parties and individuals outside the Seri Manangkasila Party in the new cabinet to form a "coalition government" that "meets the public opinion." However, some forces within the Seri Manangkasila Party advocate for the Seri Manangkasila Party to continue its one-party dictatorship. The Seri Manangkasila Party is also divided into several factions, each proposing candidates for the new cabinet to Phibun, including cabinet members who had a notorious reputation in the previous cabinet.

　  銮披汶新阁难产
    据新华社27日讯　曼谷消息：据泰国报纸报道，再度被任命为总理的銮披汶在组织新内阁的工作中遭遇困难，原定在3月21日宣布的新内阁名单仍然迟迟未能宣布。
    据报纸消息透露，马兰卡西拉自由党内部在内阁人选问题上发生的意见分歧是銮披汶所面临的主要困难。据说，銮披汶打算在新内阁中容纳马兰卡西拉自由党以外的其他拥护政府的党派和人士，组织一个“符合民意”的“联合政府”。但是，马兰卡西拉自由党内部的某些势力却主张由马兰卡西拉自由党继续一党专政。马兰卡西拉自由党内部还分成几个派别，分别向銮披汶提出新内阁阁员的人选，其中包括在上届内阁中声名狼籍的阁员。
