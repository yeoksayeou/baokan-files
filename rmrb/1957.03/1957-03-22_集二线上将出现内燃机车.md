Internal combustion locomotives will be tested and adopted on the Jining-Erlian line, an important international transport artery connecting China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia.

After six safe, punctual, fast, and over-traction operation tests between Jining and Erlian, it has been proven that internal combustion locomotives can operate on this line. The traction load can reach up to 2,000 tons, and the time is shortened by five to seven hours compared to steam locomotives.

Soon, modern internal combustion locomotives with high efficiency and low cost will appear on the Jining-Erlian line.

　  集二线上将出现内燃机车
    集宁到二连这条中、苏、蒙三国国际联运的重要干线，正在试验并将采用内燃机车牵引。
    在集宁到二连间经过六次的安全、正点、快速、超牵引的运行试验，证明了内燃机车完全可以在该线运行。牵引量最高可达两千吨，而时间上也比蒸汽机车缩短五至七小时。
    不久，集二线上将出现效率高、成本低的现代化内燃机车了。
