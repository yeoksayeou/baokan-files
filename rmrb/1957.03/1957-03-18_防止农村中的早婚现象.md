    Preventing Early Marriage in Rural Areas
    To the Editor:
    During the Spring Festival, I returned to my hometown, Kuxin Township, Wujiang County, Jiangsu Province. In just three or four days, I witnessed five couples getting married. Among these five couples, three of the men were nineteen years old, one was seventeen, and only one was thirty. As for the women, one was only fifteen years old, two were eighteen, and two were twenty-two. Half of the ten people violated the provisions of the Marriage Law.
    There are many reasons for these phenomena, and one of the most important is that publicity and education work is not being done well enough. Currently, there is very little publicity about the Marriage Law in rural areas, and many people, including some cadres, have almost forgotten the Marriage Law. For example, local township government cadres and agricultural cooperative cadres were aware of the marriages of these five couples, but they did not persuade or stop those whose ages did not meet the legal requirements. On the contrary, when the seventeen-year-old man and fifteen-year-old woman got married, the head of the advanced cooperative even acted as the marriage witness. Afterwards, I learned that this cooperative head did not even know the marriage age stipulated in the Marriage Law.
    Of course, there are not many rural cadres who are as ignorant of the Marriage Law as this cooperative head. However, those who turn a blind eye to the phenomenon of early marriage are not isolated cases. At present, the phenomenon of early marriage in violation of the Marriage Law is quite common in rural areas. Rural cadres should always pay attention to the publicity of the Marriage Law and prevent the occurrence and development of this phenomenon. (Shui Huo)

### 防止农村中的早婚现象

    防止农村中的早婚现象编辑同志：
    春节期间我回到了家乡江苏省吴江县库新乡，在短短的三四天里就见到有五对男女青年结婚。这五对中，男的有三人是十九岁，一人是十七岁，仅一人是三十岁的；在女的方面，有一个人才十五岁，两个人是十八岁，两个人是二十二岁。十个人中就有半数违反了婚姻法的规定。
    产生这些现象的原因是多方面的，其中很重要的一点是宣传教育工作做得不够。目前农村里很少宣传婚姻法，很多群众以至一些干部把婚姻法几乎忘掉了。例如，这五对青年结婚，当地乡政府干部和农业社干部是知道的，但他们并没有说服阻止那些年龄不合法律规定的人；相反的，男十七岁、女十五岁的那对青年结婚时，高级社社长还去作证婚人。事后，我了解到这位社长也不知道婚姻法上规定的结婚年龄。
    当然，在农村干部中，像这位社长那样对婚姻法一无所知的人是不太多的；但是对于早婚现象熟视无睹的人，并不是个别的。目前农村中违反婚姻法的早婚现象相当普遍，农村干部应该经常注意婚姻法的宣传，防止这种现象的发生和发展。    （水火）
