    I am an old middle school teacher, and I am very honored to attend this conference and have the opportunity to speak at it. This is truly the happiest event of my life. Today, I would like to raise two issues regarding middle school education and share some of my life experiences for your consideration and correction.

    I. The Issue of Middle School Education Quality.  Improving the quality of education is the central issue in school education, and all school work should revolve around this center. This policy is very correct, and it will remain correct in the future. Because under the leadership of the Party, we must transform our backward and impoverished agricultural country into an advanced and prosperous industrial country, and the younger generation will primarily bear this glorious and arduous responsibility. We educators should cultivate young people with socialist consciousness, modern scientific and technological skills, and strong physiques. This is one of the important factors in building socialism. Therefore, the key to improving the quality of education is to improve the level of teachers. There is a famous Chinese saying, "The student surpasses the teacher," which illustrates the importance of the teacher's guiding role. Last time, the Chinese delegation of primary and secondary school teachers visiting the Soviet Union came to Hangzhou. In their report, they analyzed that the main reason for the high learning quality of Soviet middle school students was the high teaching quality of Soviet middle school teachers. Therefore, the advanced educational experience of the Soviet Union also affirmed the importance of the teacher's guiding role. Judging from the actual situation of middle school teachers in Hangzhou, the level of middle school teachers has not yet met the objective needs. Therefore, the relationship between teachers and students in some schools is not good. I feel that to improve the relationship between teachers and students, we should strengthen ideological education on the student side, and we teachers should improve our own level, teach every lesson well, educate students well, and care for students in order to establish prestige and receive genuine respect from students. This is my first point.

    After liberation, education developed rapidly, but the training of teachers could not keep up with the needs of development. As a result, most experienced middle school teachers were promoted to universities. This weakened the ranks of middle school teachers and lowered the quality of middle school teachers. On the university side, students may not be satisfied either. Students at Hangzhou Normal College have many opinions about their teachers. I believe that the allocation of teachers in the future should follow Chairman Mao's instruction of "overall planning, taking all factors into consideration, and appropriate arrangements." This is my second point. The current low quality of teachers is an inevitable phenomenon of the too-rapid development of education and a difficulty in progress. The Party and the government have indeed taken many measures to train new teachers and improve the quality of teachers, but there is still a significant gap between this and objective needs. The reason why I emphasize this here is that it is a key issue in improving the quality of education, and more attention should be paid to it in the future to gradually improve and achieve the requirements for improving the quality of education.

    II. The Issue of Middle School Graduates.  I raise this issue based on the current tense learning situation of senior students in my school. There are thirteen classes in the senior year of our school, with a total of about seven hundred students. They all know the difficult situation of applying to universities this year, so they are studying desperately to get into universities. Our school conducted ideological education for graduates as early as last October, but it is difficult to alleviate this tense situation. Chairman Mao also said that this is an important issue. I would like to raise two hopes regarding this issue:

    1. Strengthen ideological education for students, oppose bourgeois ideology, establish proletarian ideology, and cultivate communist morality;
    2. For students who fail to pass the entrance examination, I hope that the Party, government, trade unions, school leaders, teachers, people from all walks of life, and parents will educate and help them based on their love for young students and make appropriate arrangements for them.

    III. A Little Experience with the Policy on Intellectuals.  I have been a middle school teacher for thirty-four years, twenty-one of which have been at Hangzhou No. 1 Middle School, where I currently serve, formerly known as Hangzhou High School. From 1942 to 1946, I served as the principal of Hangzhou High School. In the spring of 1946, I invited Mr. Ma Yinchu to Hangzhou High School to speak to the students. In May 1946, I supported the large-scale anti-hunger and anti-civil war demonstration launched by students from secondary and higher education institutions throughout Hangzhou. As a result, I was dismissed by the reactionary government and left Hangzhou High School. After liberation in 1949, Zhang Guomei, the Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Culture and Education, was the first to invite me back to Hangzhou High School to resume my duties as principal. At that time, I was old and weak and knew nothing about Marxism-Leninism, so I strongly declined the responsibility of principal. Minister Zhang graciously agreed and invited me to Hangzhou High School to serve as a mathematics teacher. Last July, the Secretary of the Hangzhou Municipal Party Committee and the Director of the Department of Culture and Education asked me to serve as the vice principal of Hangzhou No. 1 Middle School. I initially declined, but after repeated education from the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee and the Director of the Department of Culture and Education, I took the position of vice principal of Hangzhou No. 1 Middle School last October. I deeply realized the Party's education, unity, care, and importance to me, while the reactionary government did not value intellectuals, but rather despised them; did not care for them, but rather persecuted them. Therefore, I feel that the Party's policy toward intellectuals is unprecedented in the history of our country. This is a little experience from my life. Finally, I wish you all good health.

### 中学教师质量降低了  崔东伯的发言

    中学教师质量降低了
    崔东伯的发言
    我是一个中学的老教师，有机会列席这次大会，并有机会在大会上发言，的确是我一生最荣幸的大喜事。我今就中学教育方面，提出两个问题，同时就我一生的经历，提出一点体会，请诸位先生加以指正。
    一、中学教育质量问题  提高教育质量，是学校教育的中心问题，学校的一切工作，都应当围绕着这个中心。这个方针提得很正确，现在正确，将来还是正确。因为我们在党的领导下，要把落后贫穷的农业国，建设成为先进富强的工业国，主要是青年一代负起这个光荣而又艰巨的责任。我们教育工作者，应当培养青年具有社会主义的觉悟，现代的科学技术水平和坚强的体魄，这是建设社会主义的重要因素之一，所以提高教育质量的关键，是提高教师的水平。我国有句名言“青出于蓝”，说明了教师主导作用的重要性。上次我国中小学教师访苏代表团，来到了杭州，在传达报告中，分析了苏联中学生学习质量所以很高的最主要原因，是苏联中学教师教学质量很高，所以苏联的先进教育经验也肯定了教师主导作用的重要性。就杭州市中学教师的实际情况来讲，中学教师的水平，还不能达到客观的需要，因此有些学校师生关系，搞得不好。我觉得搞好师生关系，在学生方面，应加强思想教育，而我们教师更应提高自己的水平，上好每一堂的功课，教好学生，关心学生，才能够树立威信，受到学生真正的尊敬，这是我第一点意见。
    解放后，教育发展得很快，而师资的培养，赶不上发展的需要，因而把大部分有教学经验的中学教师提升到高等学校去了。这样一来，中学教师的阵容削弱了，中学教师的质量降低了，在高等学校方面，学生也未必感到满意。杭州师专的学生，对教师有很多的意见。我觉得今后教师的调配，应该遵照毛主席指示“统筹兼顾，适当安排”的精神，这是我第二点意见。目前教师质量还不高，是教育发展太快的必然现象，是前进中的困难，党和政府的确采取了许多措施，来培养新教师，来提高教师的质量，但和客观的需要还有很大的距离，我所以在此着重提出，因为这是提高教育质量的关键性问题，今后应当更加注意，逐步改进，达到提高教育质量的要求。
    二、中学毕业生问题  我是根据目前我校高三学生学习的紧张情况，提出这个问题。我校高三，十三个班级，共约七百个学生，他们都已知道今年投考高等学校的困难情况，所以都在拼命的学习，争取考进高等学校，我校于去年10月，提早对毕业生进行了思想教育，但是很难挽救这种紧张的情况，毛主席也讲过，这是一个重要的问题，我对这个问题，提出两点希望：
    ⒈加强对学生的思想教育，反对资产阶级思想，树立无产阶级思想，培养共产主义品德；
    ⒉对未能考取的学生，希望党政工团，学校领导和老师们，社会人士和家长们，在爱护青年学生的基础上，加以教育和帮助，作出适当的安排。
    三、对知识分子政策的一点体会  我担任中学教师，已有三十四年，其中二十一年是在我现在服务的杭州一中，以前叫杭高。1942年到1946年，我担任过杭高的校长，1946年春天，我请了马寅初老师来杭高对学生讲话，1946年5月，我支持了杭高学生所发动的全杭州市中等以上学校学生举行反饥饿、反内战的大游行，因此，我被反动政府撤职，离开了杭高。1949年解放后，浙江文教部张孤梅部长首先要请我回杭高，重长校政，当时我因年老体弱，对马列主义又一窍不通，力辞校长重责，蒙张部长俯允，请我到杭高，专任数学教师。去年7月，杭州市委书记和文教部长，要我担任杭一中的副校长，我初力辞，后经市委书记和文教部长的多次教育，我于去年10月，担任了杭一中的副校长，我深深体会到党对我的教育、团结、关怀和重视，而反动政府对知识分子不是重视，而是轻视，不是关怀，而是迫害，所以我觉得党对知识分子的政策，是我国有史以来，从未有过，这是我一生经历中的一点体会。最后祝诸位先生身体健康。（附图片）
