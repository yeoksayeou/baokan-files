Overseas Chinese Enthusiastically Respond to the Call for Peaceful Liberation of Taiwan
Some Opinions from Overseas Chinese Chen Zhanmei in Burma

    This time I returned to China to attend the conference. Before the conference, I contacted and talked with people from all walks of life. On many issues, I couldn't figure them out, and I felt a little uneasy. I thought that our country has made great progress in the past few years, so why are there still so many problems. Later, at the enlarged meeting of the Supreme State Conference, after listening to Chairman Mao's instructions, I clearly realized that although there are many problems, they are not problems of antagonism between ourselves and the enemy; they are just trivial incidents belonging to the internal contradictions of the people themselves, which can be gradually resolved without any doubt. However, I have one experience regarding the formation of these problems. In the past few years, it seems that in our propaganda, we have overemphasized how beautiful and happy the people's lives are in a socialist society, while neglecting to warn the people of the various difficulties they will encounter in the process of building a socialist society. Therefore, the general public is only filled with the anticipation of a beautiful and happy life, without being prepared to resist the arduous tasks in the construction process. With excessive expectations, once encountering some unsatisfactory things, it will increase the mood of dissatisfaction with the status quo. The spread of this kind of unreasonable consciousness has a great obstacle to socialist construction, and it should be reversed as soon as possible.

    Secondly, I feel that the agricultural cooperation movement, in which 500 million farmers expect to improve their lives, has achieved results based on the situation from all sides in the past year. However, it is still far from actual requirements. From the newspapers, I have seen that the relevant departments have made every effort to transfer a large number of cadres to the countryside to strengthen the leadership of production work. This measure is correct and timely. The potential power of farmers is endless. If the leadership cooperates well, I believe that good results will be achieved, and the lives of farmers will be further improved. At the same time, it may also provide corresponding help to the development prospects of light and heavy industries. The interaction is very important. As far as I know, farmers are willing to work hard. As long as the leadership is appropriate, nothing is impossible.

    Thirdly, regarding the promotion of increasing production and practicing economy, I personally believe that it is in line with the excellent tradition of our nation to build a family through diligence and thrift, and it is an important key to building a socialist society in the future. How great is the power of 600 million people. To be able to truly and effectively do it, everyone must work hard to increase production, and everyone must unite to practice economy. Then, a trickle becomes a river, and a pile of sand becomes a tower, which has a decisive effect on the construction of socialist undertakings. I hope that the comrades participating in the meeting will set an example, take the lead, and serve as a role model, so that it becomes a permanent simple style, which is an important hub.

    I came from Burma to attend the meeting, and I would like to talk about some situations. Overseas Chinese in Burma can understand and practice what Premier Zhou instructed in his speech, respect local customs and habits, and get along with friendly people. Among our own compatriots, we meet each other with sincerity on the principle of loving the country as one family, regardless of priority. Overseas Chinese in Burma also enthusiastically responded to our government's call for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Overseas Chinese organizations in Yangon and Burma sent telegrams to the Taiwan authorities, urging them to prioritize the country and the nation and negotiate peace as soon as possible. This response has been valued by overseas Chinese in other parts of Southeast Asia, and has become a common atmosphere of approving peace. Through this movement, overseas Chinese in Burma have become more united, which is a good phenomenon. Overseas Chinese in Burma generally have some requirements, that is, they are very grateful for our government's various measures to love and protect overseas Chinese. However, some grassroots cadres in some places have not been able to implement the policies, so there are still many trivial problems. I hope that the relevant departments can give practical improvements. Only in this way can the relatives of overseas Chinese in their hometowns and compatriots abroad be integrated into one. Secondly, there are still many difficulties in the employment of returned overseas Chinese and the enrollment of returned students, and I hope that our government can pay attention to this and pay attention to dealing with it.

    侨胞热烈响应和平解放台湾的号召
    旅缅侨胞陈占梅的几点意见
    我这次回国参加会议，在未开会之前，与各方面人士接触交谈，在许多问题上，总是想不通，心里就有点不安感觉，以为我们国家几年来已经有了很大进步，为什么还会存在这样多的问题。过后在最高国务会议的扩大会议上，听了毛主席的指示，就清楚地认识问题虽多，并不是敌我对抗问题；而是属于人民自己内部矛盾的枝节事件，很容易可以逐步得到解决，是毫无疑义的。不过我对这些问题之形成，有一个体会。几年来好像我们在宣传方面，过于强调社会主义社会人民生活是如何美满和幸福这一面，而忽略于警惕人民在进行社会主义社会建设过程中会遭遇种种困难之另一面，因此一般广大群众，只满怀美满幸福生活之来临，而不准备去抵挡建设过程中艰巨任务。在过分希望中，一旦遇着一些不如意事，就会增长不满现状的情绪。此种不合理意识的滋蔓，对社会主义建设，有莫大阻力，实应及早扭转过来。
    其次，觉得五亿农民指望生活改善之农业合作化运动，一年来从各方情况看来是有成绩的。但距离实际要求，相差尚远。从报上看到有关部门，已下全力调拨大量干部下乡，加强领导生产工作。此一措施，是正确的，而且是及时的。农民潜在力量，无穷无尽，若领导配合得好，相信必会得到良好效果，则农民生活进一步获得提高。同时对轻重工业发展前途，亦可能得到相应帮助。互起作用，关系甚大。据我所了解，农民是肯干的，只要领导得宜，是无事不成功的。
    再次，关于提倡增产节约问题，我个人认为正符合于我民族优良传统勤俭起家之至理，是今后建设社会主义社会一重要关键。六亿人民力量是如何伟大。要能切切实实做到，大家动手努力增产，万众一心实行节约，那么细水成河，积沙成塔，对建设社会主义事业，是有决定性作用的。愿参加会议同志们，以身作则，起带头，作榜样，使成为一种永久俭朴风气，实一重要枢纽。
    我是缅甸回来出席的，顺便谈一些情况。旅缅华侨对我周总理谈话所指示，都能体会而且力行，格尊当地风俗习惯，与友邦人士友好相处。自己侨胞中，在爱国一家、不分先后之原则上，相见以诚。对我政府号召和平解放台湾运动，缅华侨胞，亦热烈响应。仰光市以及缅属侨团，均纷电台湾当局，劝以国家民族为重，早日商谈和平。此一响应，大受其他南洋各地华侨重视，而蔚成为一种普遍赞同和平气氛。缅华侨胞，通过这一次运动，更日趋团结一致，实一良好现象。缅华侨胞普遍有些要求，即对我政府爱侨护侨种种措施，非常感激。但有些地方基层干部对政策推行，尚未能贯彻，因而枝节问题存在不少，甚希望各有关部门，能予以切实改善。使侨乡归侨国外同胞，方能打成一片。其次对回国归侨就业与回国学生就学问题，目前实际上仍存有许多困难，亦切望我政府能予以重视，并从而注意加以处理。（附图片）
