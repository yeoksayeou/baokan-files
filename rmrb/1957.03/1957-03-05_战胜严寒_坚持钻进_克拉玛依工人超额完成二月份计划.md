Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, 4th. Karamay oilfield's workers of all ethnicities overcame severe cold and exceeded the February drilling footage plan. There have also been significant improvements in drilling quality.

In February, the temperature in Karamay was often more than ten degrees below zero Celsius. The severe cold brought many difficulties to the drilling work. Drilling tools were difficult to handle due to freezing. Drill pipes became ice columns as soon as they were lifted off the ground, and iron tools were so cold that they stuck to the skin, sometimes tearing it. At the same time, because of the cold weather, cars were difficult to start, and the supply of water for drilling also became difficult. However, the drilling workers persisted in normal drilling on the Gobi Desert day and night. In a drilling well in the Urhe exploration area, because the supply of drilling mud water was cut off, the workers and cadres went to the river to chisel ice and melt water to ensure that the drilling rig did not stop. Some drilling teams launched rapid drilling, improving drilling efficiency. Well No. 225 drilled 1,115 meters in twenty-one days. Well No. 122 created a new Xinjiang record of 510 meters per day.

### 战胜严寒  坚持钻进  克拉玛依工人超额完成二月份计划

    战胜严寒  坚持钻进
    克拉玛依工人超额完成二月份计划
    新华社克拉玛依4日电  克拉玛依油田各族工人战胜严寒，超额完成了2月份钻探进尺计划，在钻探质量方面也有显著改进。
    2月份的克拉玛依气温经常在摄氏零下十多度。严寒为钻井工作带来许多困难。钻具和工具由于冰冻很难掌握，钻杆一提到地面就成了冰柱，铁工具都冻得粘手，有时候挨上皮肤，皮肤就会被撕破。同时因为天气冷，汽车不好发动，钻探用水的供应也发生了困难。但钻井工人们还是日日夜夜在戈壁滩上坚持着正常钻进。乌尔禾探区的一口钻井因为钻探泥浆用水供应不上了，工人、干部们就到河上凿冰化水来保证钻机不停顿下来。有些钻井队展开了快速钻进，提高了钻进效率，二百二十五号井队在二十一天中就钻进了一千一百一十五公尺。一百二十二井队则创造了日进尺五百一十公尺的全新疆最高纪录。
