    After the 1956 science awards were announced, a story circulated in the capital's scientific community about a husband and wife who both won awards. They are dynamicist Wu Zhonghua and female mechanician Li Minhua. Li Minhua's scientific achievements were the result of many arduous efforts. In particular, as a mother, various difficulties in life severely tested her will to engage in scientific research.

    Recently, the reporter visited her at the Institute of Mechanics. She recalled her studies and life more than ten years ago.

    Li Minhua and Wu Zhonghua already had a one-year-old child when they went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States in 1944 to study. Because of giving birth to this child, she was unable to catch up with the public-funded examination before going abroad. She originally planned to apply for a scholarship after arriving in the United States, but the U.S. government stipulated that mothers with children were not eligible for scholarship benefits. She had to rely on Wu Zhonghua's scholarship and a little foreign exchange brought from home for living expenses. A year later, they had another child. Their economic situation did not allow them to hire a nanny. Li Minhua was determined to continue her studies, and they desperately needed social support, but they could not find a nursery anywhere. What they heard from friends and teachers was either blame or doubt. Some suggested that Li Minhua return home to take care of the children and her husband, because in the United States, very few women with children studied at universities. Li Minhua did not succumb to the difficulties. The idea of studying engineering well and serving the country in the future encouraged her, and Wu Zhonghua also supported her to continue studying.

    In order to facilitate taking care of the children, they moved their home closer to the school. Fortunately, their class times were different, so they could take turns looking after the children at home. Her husband, Wu Zhonghua, also fed the children milk like a housewife, played with them, and rocked them to sleep in the cradle. As soon as Li Minhua returned home, she put down her notebook and busied herself taking care of the children. While studying during the day, she often looked at the books, while also paying attention to the children's movements. In the evening, after the children fell asleep, they concentrated on reviewing their lessons. Many calculations in her doctoral dissertation were completed while watching the children.

    Li Minhua said that having children of course brought difficulties to studying, but if time was arranged well, it was still possible to study well. She said that the attitude towards learning was very important. When she was pregnant for the second time in 1945, she had already completed the credits for her master's degree, but in order to seek more knowledge, she still chose new courses. During the summer vacation, she also chose a research topic using experimental methods, and used the evenings to do experiments at school.

    In 1954, they returned to their motherland with their children. She said: "The country gives great encouragement to female staff members, so I feel that I should work harder. But I don't think that one should neglect the responsibilities one should fulfill towards children and family because of engaging in scientific research."

    Li Minhua is also a mother who is good at raising children. In her spare time, she always likes to be with the children, sometimes playing badminton with them, or singing and chatting together. When the children are just starting something new, Li Minhua also pays attention to helping them establish good habits. When the eldest child first entered elementary school, Li Minhua watched him do his homework after school and helped him solve difficult problems, so that the child was interested in his lessons and also developed the good habit of always finishing one aspect of his homework before doing something else. Now, this child always finishes all his homework before his mother comes home.

    科学家——母亲
    新华社记者　朱彬
    1956年度科学奖金颁布后，在首都科学界中就流传着一对夫妇齐得奖的佳话。他们是动力学家吴仲华和女力学家李敏华。李敏华在科学上的成就，是她经过了许多艰苦努力才得到的。特别是作为一个母亲，生活上的各种困难曾经使她从事科学研究的意志经历了严峻的考验。
    最近，记者在力学研究所里访问了她。她向记者回忆了十多年前的学习和生活情况。
    李敏华和吴仲华在1944年去到美国马萨诸塞理工学院学习时，就已经有了一个一岁的孩子。因为生这个孩子，她在出国前没有能够赶上公费考试。她本想到美国后再申请助学金，但美国政府却规定凡是有孩子的母亲一律不得享受助学金的待遇。她只好依靠吴仲华的一份助学金和从家里带去的一点外汇生活。隔了一年，他们又添了一个孩子。经济情况不允许他们请保姆，李敏华又决心把学习继续下去，他们非常需要社会上的支持，但是那里怎样也找不到托儿所。从朋友和教师们那儿听到的不是责难就是疑问，有人就建议李敏华回到家庭去照顾孩子和丈夫，因为在美国很少有有了孩子的妇女在大学里读书。李敏华没有在困难面前屈服，学好工程将来为国家服务的想法鼓舞着她，吴仲华也支持她继续学下去。
    为了便于照顾孩子，她们把家搬到靠近学校的地方住，恰好两人上课的时间不相同，可以轮流在家看管孩子。丈夫吴仲华也像家庭主妇一样地给孩子喂牛奶、陪孩子玩、推着摇篮把孩子哄进梦乡。李敏华一回到家，放下笔记本就忙着照顾孩子。白天学习时，常常两眼看着书，同时留心着孩子们的动静。晚上，孩子都入睡了，两人就集中精力温习功课。她的博士论文中有许多计算就是一面看着孩子一面完成的。
    李敏华说，有了孩子当然给学习带来了困难，但时间安排得好，还是能好好学习的。她说，对待学习的态度很重要。1945年第二次怀孕时，她读硕士学位的学分已经满了，可是为了多求一些知识，还是选了新的功课，暑假期间又选了一个用实验方法的研究题目，利用晚上到学校里去做试验。
    1954年他们带着孩子回到了祖国，她说：“国内对女工作人员给以很大的鼓励，因而自己觉得对工作应当更加努力。但是我认为不应当因为从事科学研究工作而疏忽对孩子对家庭应尽的责任。”
    李敏华还是一个善于抚育孩子的母亲。她在空暇的时间里总喜欢和孩子在一起，有时和孩子们打羽毛球，或者一起唱歌、谈天。在孩子们刚开始一件新的事情时，李敏华还注意帮助孩子树立好的习惯。大孩子刚进小学，放学后李敏华就看着他做功课，帮助他解决疑难问题，使孩子对功课有兴趣，也养成了每做一方面功课就一定做完的好习惯。现在这个孩子每天的功课总是在妈妈回家前就全部做好的。
