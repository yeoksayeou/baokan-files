The Wuhan Steel construction site is particularly busy this spring. Five major projects, including the sintering plant, concentrator, and No. 1 blast furnace of the iron smelting plant, are scheduled to begin construction this year, with the refractory material plant and coking and chemical plant commencing in the spring.

Currently, the outer ring roads and factory ring roads of several major project areas have been completed, and more than ten railways and highways form a close transportation network here. Hundreds of work sheds and canteens have been built on the site, and construction teams are successively entering the construction site. Excavator operators and scraper operators are leveling the last hilltop in the coking plant area. Concrete mixing stations and prefabrication plants standing in the auxiliary enterprise plant area are manufacturing columns and floor slabs for major projects day and night, and heavy-duty trucks are continuously transporting these prefabricated products to the construction site.

In order to meet the needs of the major project construction, the Wuhan Thermal Power Plant, as a power hub, has installed thousands of tons of equipment, striving to start partial power supply in the first half of the year. The first boiler of this plant has passed the first water pressure test, and none of the more than 1,400 welded joints leaked water, reaching the advanced installation level in the country. The auxiliary repair implementation area, composed of more than 40 buildings, has also built new factory buildings one after another; metal structure, forging and mechanical repair, and automobile repair workshops are installing equipment, and will soon be able to undertake part of the manufacturing and repair tasks in the construction. The mixing station, which can turn 80 railcars of cement into concrete every day, is also being expanded to produce a variety of concrete.

The amount of work for the Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise this year is more than double that of last year, and the amount of materials used is very large. The builders on the construction site are actively trying to save construction materials. The newly built prestressed concrete workshop has begun production, and the components produced can reduce the use of steel by 30% to 70% and cement by 50%. The coal storage tower of the coking plant will promote the sliding lift formwork method, which can save 800 cubic meters of wood for each coal storage tower.

On the eve of the commencement of major projects, hundreds of youth shock brigades on the construction site have formulated this year's plan on the basis of successfully completing last year's tasks. The famous Wang Guijun excavator shock brigade guarantees to complete 310,000 cubic meters of excavation tasks this year. The Yang Zhen automobile shock brigade guarantees to complete the annual national plan two months ahead of schedule. More than 1,000 advanced producers on the construction site are exchanging experiences, preparing to meet the commencement of major projects with more skilled techniques.

    武钢的春天
    陈牧  肖定
    今年春天的武钢工地特别繁忙。烧结厂、选矿厂、炼铁厂的一号高炉等五项主要工程今年就要开始建设，其中耐火材料厂和炼焦化工厂在春天就要动工。
    现在，几个主要工程区的外围大道和环厂公路已经修通，十多条铁路和公路在这里组成了紧密的运输网。上百栋的工棚和食堂等已经在现场上搭盖起来，施工队伍陆续进入了工地。挖土机手和铲运机手们正在削平焦化厂区的最后一个山头。矗立在附属企业厂区的混凝土搅拌站和预制品厂，在日夜为主要工程制造柱子和楼板，载重汽车川流不息地将这些预制品赶运到工地。
    为了适应主要工程施工的需要，作为动力枢纽的武汉热电厂，已经将成千上万吨的设备安装起来，争取在上半年就开始部分送电。这个厂的第一号锅炉已经过了第一次水压试验，一千四百多个焊接对口没有一处漏水，达到了全国先进的安装水平。由四十多个建筑物组成的辅助修理实施区，也盖起了一片片新厂房；金属结构、锻造和机械修理、汽车修理等车间正在安装设备，不久可以担负起施工中的部分制造和修理任务。每天能把八十车皮水泥制造成混凝土的搅拌站也在紧张扩建，以便能生产多品种的混凝土。
    武汉钢铁联合企业今年的工程量比去年大一倍多，所用的材料数量很大，工地上的建设者们正在积极设法节约建筑材料。新建的预加应力混凝土车间已经开始生产，所制构件能少用30％到70％的钢筋和50％的水泥。焦化厂的贮煤塔将推行滑动式提升模板，每个贮煤塔能节约八百立方公尺木材。
    在主要工程开工的前夕，工地上的上百个青年突击队又在胜利完成去年任务的基础上，订出了今年的规划。著名的王贵君挖土机突击队保证在今年完成三十一万立方的挖土任务。杨珍汽车突击队保证提前两个月完成全年的国家计划。工地上的一千多名先进生产者正在交流经验，准备以更加熟练的技术迎接主要工程的开工。
