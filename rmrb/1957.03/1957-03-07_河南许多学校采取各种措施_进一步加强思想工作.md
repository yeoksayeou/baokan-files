    This newspaper reports that since the beginning of the new semester, many schools in Henan Province, based on the concentrated political and ideological education conducted for students before the winter vacation last year, have adopted various specific measures to further strengthen political and ideological education for students.
    Before and after the start of the semester, Party, Youth League, and administrative organizations in many schools learned about and analyzed the current ideological situation of students by holding student forums and conducting in-depth family visits. Zhengyang No. 1 Junior High School organized teachers to go to the countryside to deeply understand the overall situation of students' family life and production. Anyang City's Third and Fourth Middle Schools have established connections with Jinhua, Gongnong, Sanjiazhuang, and Fengjiamiao agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs, laying the foundation for strengthening students' political and ideological education and smoothly evaluating and distributing student grants in the future. Through investigation and understanding, it can be seen that although students received a concentrated political and ideological education before the winter vacation last year, which improved their understanding of the international situation and the superiority of agricultural cooperativization to varying degrees, the effect was not significant due to the short duration and insufficient in-depth discussion. Students' contact with actual life after returning to their hometowns was also affected by some unhealthy factors, causing ideological fluctuations. Therefore, further strengthening political and ideological education for students is of particular significance. Zhengzhou No. 1 High School and Hui Nationality Middle School have, with the school Party branch as the core, jointly studied the issue of strengthening students' political and ideological education with the school administration, Youth League, trade union, and China Democratic League, placing this work in the primary position in the school's work plan. Zhengzhou Second Health School has also formulated a plan to conduct systematic labor education, current affairs and policy education, and hard work education for students.
    At present, schools in various places have done a lot of work in strengthening political and ideological education for students. Most schools held themed forums such as "What I Saw and Heard in My Hometown" and "My Hometown" at the beginning of the semester to enhance their understanding of agricultural cooperativization through students' personal experiences. All students of Kaifeng Normal College not only held a forum on "Returning from the Countryside" but also opened a "Rural Sightings" column in the college journal. Henan Agricultural College and Zhengzhou No. 1 High School have invited cadres who participated in the Long March to give reports on the stories of the Long March, in order to educate students on hard work and carry forward the fine traditions of the revolution.

### 河南许多学校采取各种措施  进一步加强思想工作

    河南许多学校采取各种措施
    进一步加强思想工作
    本报讯　新学期开学以来，河南省许多学校在去年放寒假前集中对学生进行政治思想教育的基础上，采取各种具体措施，进一步加强对学生的政治思想教育。
    开学前后，许多学校的党、团、行政等组织通过召开学生座谈会、深入家庭访问，了解分析了当前学生的思想情况。正阳第一初中曾组织教师下乡深入学生家庭，了解学生家庭生活、生产的全面情况；安阳市第三、第四中学都与郊区建华、工农、三家庄、冯家庙等农业社建立了联系，为今后加强学生政治思想教育、顺利评发助学金等工作打下了基础。通过调查了解，可以看出，去年在寒假前虽然对学生集中进行过一次政治思想教育，使学生对国际形势、农业合作化的优越性等方面的认识有不同程度的提高。但由于时间短促，讨论不够深入、细致，效果不大。学生回乡后接触实际生活也受到某些不健康因素的影响，引起思想波动，因此进一步加强对学生的政治思想教育具有特别重要的意义。郑州第一高中、回民中学都曾以学校党支部为核心与学校行政、青年团、工会、民盟等组织共同研究了加强学生政治思想教育工作问题，将这一工作列入学校工作计划的首要地位。郑州第二卫生学校还制订了向学生进行政治思想教育计划，准备向学生系统地进行劳动教育、时事政策教育、艰苦奋斗教育等。
    目前，各地学校在加强对学生政治思想教育方面已作了许多工作。大部分学校在开学之初举行了“家乡见闻”、“我的家乡”等主题座谈会，以学生亲身体会来提高他们对农业合作化的认识。开封师范学院全体学生不但举行了“从农村归来”座谈会，还在院刊上开辟了“农村见闻”专栏。河南农学院、郑州一高等都曾邀请参加过长征的干部作关于长征故事的报告，借以向学生进行艰苦奋斗、发扬革命优良传统的教育。
