Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: A fishing boat belonging to the First Production Cooperative of Qingge Township, Qiongdong County, Hainan Island, was suddenly shot at by the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem troops illegally occupying Ganquan Island while attempting to obtain fresh water at Ganquan Island in the Xisha Islands on January 25th. Fisherman Fu Qibao was wounded by the shooting. The South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem's troops continue to illegally occupy several other islands near Ganquan Island, such as Coral Island and Jinyin Island. The Xisha Islands are an inseparable part of China's territory. The Chinese government has repeatedly and solemnly declared that the Xisha Islands and Nansha Islands, like the entire Nansha Islands, Zhongsha Islands, and Dongsha Islands, have always been Chinese territory. Although they were once occupied by Japanese imperialism during its war of aggression, they were all taken over by the Chinese government at the time after Japan surrendered. The legitimate sovereignty over these islands shall not be infringed upon by any country.

The illegal occupation of the aforementioned islands by the troops of the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique and the shooting at our fishing boats not only threatens and harms our fishermen in that area, but is also a provocative act by the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique against our country's sovereignty. This incident has increasingly attracted the attention and anger of the Chinese people.

    南越军队非法侵占我甘泉等岛并打伤我渔民
    我国人民严重注视吴庭艳集团的挑衅
    新华社6日讯　我海南岛琼东县青葛乡第一生产合作社的一只渔船，1月25日在前往西沙群岛的甘泉岛取给淡水时，突然遭到非法侵占该岛的南越吴庭艳军队的射击，渔民符气保被射伤。南越吴庭艳的军队并继续非法侵占甘泉岛附近的其它几个岛屿如珊瑚岛和金银岛，查西沙群岛是我国领土不可分割的一部分，我国政府曾迭次严正声明，西沙群岛和南威群岛正如整个南沙群岛及中沙群岛、东沙群岛一样，向为中国领土。在日本帝国主义发动侵略战争时虽曾一度沦陷，但日本投降后已为当时中国政府全部接收。这些岛屿的合法主权，绝不容许任何国家加以侵犯。
    南越吴庭艳集团的军队非法侵占上述岛屿并开枪射击我渔船，这不仅使我国在那个地区的渔民受到威胁和损失，而且是南越吴庭艳集团侵犯我国主权的一种挑衅行为。这一事件已日益引起我国人民的注意和愤怒。
