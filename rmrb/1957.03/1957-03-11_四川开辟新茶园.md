Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 9th: Sichuan Province, famous for producing "Sichuan Black Tea," "Fried Green Tea," and "Border Tea," currently has tens of thousands of tea-growing farmers who have joined agricultural cooperatives and are starting to develop new tea plantations under the unified arrangements of the cooperatives.

This year, Sichuan Province plans to open more than 100,000 mu of new tea plantations. This figure exceeds that of any previous year. The new tea plantations are mainly being developed in the key tea-producing regions of Yibin, Ya'an, and Leshan. The methods used are sowing tea seeds, transplanting tea seedlings, and reclaiming barren tea gardens. The new tea plantations opened this year will be able to produce tea in three to four years.

Last year, Sichuan Province's total tea output reached more than 320,000 dan, an increase of more than 220,000 dan compared to 1949. Tea sales cover the province and Tibet. "Sichuan Black Tea" and "Fried Green Tea" are also exported to the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries in Eastern Europe. This year, the province plans to maintain its total tea output at last year's level, concentrating its efforts on improving harvesting and processing methods to further improve the quality of tea.

    四川开辟新茶园
    新华社成都9日电　以出产“川红”、“炒青”和“边茶”著称的四川省，目前有数万个已经加入农业社的种茶农民，正在社的统一安排下动手开辟新茶园。
    今年四川省计划开辟新茶园十万多亩。这个数字超过已往任何一年。开辟新茶园的地方主要在宜宾、雅安和乐山等几个重点产茶专区。办法是播种茶子，移栽茶苗，垦复荒芜的茶园。今年开辟的新茶园，三四年以后就可以出产茶叶。
    去年四川省茶叶总产量达三十二万多担，比1949年增加了二十二万多担。茶叶销区遍及省内和西藏。“川红”和“炒青”还运销苏联和东欧各人民民主国家。今年计划全省茶叶总产量维持去年的水平，集中力量改进采制方法，进一步提高茶叶的品质。
