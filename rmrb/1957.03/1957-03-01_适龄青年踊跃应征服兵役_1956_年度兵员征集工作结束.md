Xinhua News Agency, 28th - According to the Ministry of National Defense, the 1956 annual military recruitment work was fully completed by the end of February.

Since the annual military recruitment work began in November of last year, in accordance with the provisions of the Military Service Law, vast numbers of young people of eligible age throughout the country have enthusiastically signed up for enlistment. Touching stories of parents encouraging their sons and wives encouraging their husbands have emerged everywhere. Many young people of eligible age have repeatedly requested local military service bureaus, dozens of times, to approve their military service in order to fulfill their duty to defend the motherland. According to statistics from the three cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, and the six provinces of Jilin, Liaoning, Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, and Zhejiang, Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members account for 63.9% of the young people who enlisted in the army, those with a cultural level of senior elementary school or above account for 59.73%, and those aged eighteen account for 97.18%.

Currently, with the exception of a few areas, the new recruits collected from various places have successively arrived at the various services and arms of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, where they have received a warm welcome from officers and veteran soldiers, and have successively begun military and political studies.

The Ministry of National Defense has also made specific arrangements for this year's demobilization work of veteran soldiers.

    自从去年11月间按照兵役法规定，开始进行一年一度的兵员征集工作以来，全国各地广大的适龄青年踊跃报名应征，到处都出现父母鼓励儿子、妻子鼓励丈夫的动人事例。许多适龄青年接连几次到几十次请求当地兵役局批准他们服兵役，以履行保卫祖国的职责。据北京、天津、上海三个市和吉林、辽宁、河北、山西、河南、浙江六个省统计，在应征入伍的青年中，共产党员、青年团员合占63.9％，文化程度在高小以上的占59.73％，年龄十八周岁的占97.18％。
    现在，除个别地区外，各地征集的新兵都陆续到达了中国人民解放军各军种、兵种部队，受到军官和老战士的热情接待，并且已经先后开始进行军事、政治学习。
    国防部对今年的老战士复员工作，也已经作出了具体安排。
