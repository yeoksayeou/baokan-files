Opinions on Language Reform
Speech by Zhou Yawei

I would like to present two sets of opinions on language reform:

(I) In the work of simplifying Chinese characters, we must change the phenomenon of language scholars avoiding responsibility, correct the unscientific phenomenon of simplified characters, and re-establish the fundamental concept of the work of simplifying Chinese characters.

(II) In the work of the Chinese phonetic alphabet, we must practice the prerequisite of "a phonetic scheme having multiple uses" and implement the basic principles of "phoneme-based" and "one phoneme, one symbol; one symbol, one phoneme."

I. "Conventional usage" and "not creating new characters" do not meet the requirements of simplifying Chinese characters.

The work of simplifying Chinese characters should, of course, be undertaken by language scholars familiar with Chinese character construction. Language scholars are familiar with the structure of Chinese characters, and they can adapt to social development and, based on the original construction principles of Chinese characters, scientifically and reasonably propose good plans for simplifying Chinese characters.

Unfortunately, our current work of simplifying Chinese characters is not done this way; instead, language scholars are avoiding the actual work responsibility of simplifying Chinese characters; instead, they only look at the external form of the characters, regardless of the content of their construction; some simplified characters are extremely unscientific.

Language reform is undoubtedly a part of the revolutionary cause. The first principle of the current work of simplifying Chinese characters, "conventional usage," is not revolutionary enough. The characters in the first table of the Chinese character simplification scheme can be said to be relatively in line with the conditions of conventional usage; most of the characters in the second table do not meet this condition. This is proven by the facts; "conventional usage" is not suitable for the requirements of the work of simplifying Chinese characters.

The second principle of the work of simplifying Chinese characters is "not creating new characters." The practical significance of this principle is: language scholars do not create new characters, but listen to everyone else, soldiers and civilians alike, to create them. This phenomenon is like: when a patient needs surgery, doctors and nurses stand by and watch, letting the masses wield the knife and cut randomly. Like: when modifying a tractor, engineers and workers do not move a finger, but want the farmers to dismantle and mess around with it. The characters used in the Chinese character simplification scheme are all new characters created by the masses.

In the past, there were some intellectuals who were unwilling to serve the people wholeheartedly. Those years are gone. The undesirable phenomena mentioned above that exist in the current work of simplifying Chinese characters should no longer be tolerated.

Now, there are not many language scholars in the whole country—intellectuals who study the structure of Chinese characters; it can be said that there are far fewer than doctors, and even fewer than famous doctors. Language scholars are the saviors of Chinese characters and the treasures of the people. Language scholars, who wholeheartedly serve the people: it is now urgent to re-establish the fundamental concept of simplifying Chinese characters, take on the actual responsibility of this work, and fulfill this glorious and great historical task!

II. The Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme has multiple uses, not only domestically needed, but also internationally needed.

The Latinization of Chinese pinyin is not only needed domestically, but especially internationally. Even if the Latinization of Chinese pinyin is not needed domestically, it is extremely urgently needed internationally. Therefore, the Chinese Latinization pinyin must pay attention to the correspondence with international phonetics as an important aspect that cannot be ignored.

The Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme (Draft) explains that the phonetic scheme and the phonetic script are two different things, and explains the prerequisite that the phonetic scheme "has multiple uses." The Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme (Draft) proposes the basic principles of "phoneme-based" and "one phoneme, one symbol; one symbol, one phoneme." The above prerequisites and basic principles are very progressive and extremely correct. Unfortunately, in practice, they have been shaken, not achieved, and not followed.

The actual pronunciation of the phonetic scheme (draft) is limited to Beijing pronunciation and can only spell Beijing pronunciation; and it is still not enough, some are inconsistent with the facts of Beijing pronunciation, but are forcibly matched. As for the transliteration and minority language pronunciation proposed in the original description of various uses, there are many deficiencies; even, it shows that this aspect is not valued at all.

The actual pronunciation of the phonetic scheme (draft) does not clearly distinguish between phonemes and non-phonemes. In handling, some non-phonemes have their phonetic symbols. Some phonemes do not have phonetic symbols but use pinyin. Some phonetic symbols are one symbol for several phonemes, which is said to have "no difficulty," which is incorrect, and there are difficulties.

The specific problems of the above-mentioned aspects can be summarized as follows: (1) There are too few vowels and not enough to use. (2) Voiced consonants have been abandoned. (3) The unaspirated and aspirated sounds of the same rhyme have not been properly handled. Detailed content will not be listed one by one.

The reason is that the prerequisites and basic principles are not firmly grasped, and they are shaken by the pursuit of saving the total number of letters, considering the use of various mechanical technologies, etc., restricted by Beijing pronunciation (also reducing Beijing pronunciation), and bound by the old habits of the Latin-based languages (also conflicting with some principles).

I support the prerequisites put forward in theory in the phonetic scheme (draft)—"a phonetic scheme has multiple uses" and the basic principles of "phoneme-based" and "one phoneme, one symbol; one symbol, one phoneme." I oppose the phonetic scheme (draft) actually abandoning and destroying these prerequisites and basic principles. (Attached picture)

### 对文字改革的意见　周亚卫的发言

　　对文字改革的意见
　　周亚卫的发言
    我现在提出关于文字改革方面的两部分意见：
      （一）汉字简化工作，要改变文字学者回避责任的现象，要纠正简成汉字的不科学现象，要重新建立汉字简化工作的根本观念。
    （二）汉语拼音工作，要实践“拼音方案有多种用处”的先决前提，要贯彻“音素化”和“一素一标、一标一素”的基本原则。
    一　“约定俗成”“不造新字”不合乎简化汉字的要求
    汉字简化工作，当然应该由熟悉汉字构造的文字学者，来担任这一实际工作任务。文字学者们，熟悉汉字构造，他们能够适应社会发展，根据汉字原来的构造理则，来科学地、合理地提出汉字简化的良好方案。
    可惜，我们目前的汉字简化工作，不是这样做；而是文字学者回避了汉字简化的实际工作责任；而是只看文字外形，不管构造内容；有一些简成的字极不科学。
    文字改革，无疑，是革命事业的一部分。现在汉字简化工作的第一原则“约定俗成”，是不够革命的。汉字简化方案第一表的字，还可以说是比较合于约定俗成的条件；第二表的字，就大部分合不上这个条件了。这就是事实证明；“约定俗成”不适合于汉字简化工作的要求。
    汉字简化工作的第二原则是“不造新字”。这一原则的实际意义，是：文字学者不造新字，听从其他一切军民人等大家来造。这种现象，犹如：对病人要施手术，医生和护士都袖手旁观，让群众操刀乱割。犹如：修改拖拉机，工程师和工人不动手，要农民们乱拆乱弄。汉字简化方案所用的字，都是群众所造的新字。
    过去，曾经有一些知识分子不肯全心全意为人民服务的。那样的年月已经过去了。当前在汉字简化工作中存在着像以上所说的不良现象，再不应该容忍下去了。
    现在，全国所有的文字学者——研究汉字构造的知识分子，并不很多；可以说：比医生少的多，比名医还要少。文字学者们，是汉字的救星，是人民的宝贝。全心全意为人民服务的文字学者先生们：重新来建立汉字简化的根本观念，承担起这一工作的实际责任，来服行这光荣伟大的历史任务，现在已经是迫切的时候了！
    二　汉语拼音方案兼有多种用处不仅国内需要国际上也需要
    汉语拉丁化拼音，不只是国内需要，尤其是国际需要。即使国内不需用汉语拉丁化拼音，在国际上也极其迫切地需要着。因此，汉语拉丁化拼音，以照顾和国际语音的对应关系为不可忽视的重要方面。
    汉语拼音方案（草案），说明了拼音方案和拼音文字是两回事，说明了拼音方案“兼有多种用处”这一先决前提。汉语拼音方案（草案），提出了“音素化”和“一素一标、一标一素”的基本原则。以上的先决前提和基本原则，是很进步的、极正确的。可惜，实际上动摇了，没有做到，没有照这样做。
    拼音方案（草案）的实际用音，只限于北京音，只能拼北京音；并且也还不够，有一些是和北京音的事实不符，而强充硬配的。至对于原说明各种用处中所提出的译音和少数民族用音更是欠缺了不少；甚至，显出了对于这方面根本不被重视。
    拼音方案（草案）的实际用音，对于音素和非音素，界限还不分明。在处理上，有的非音素有它的音标。有的音素没有音标而用拼音。有的音标是一标几素，据说“没有困难”，这是不正确的，是有困难的。
    以上所说各端的具体问题，总起来说，主要是：（1）元音缺少，不够用。（2）浊辅音被遗弃了。（3）同音部的不送气和送气没有得到妥当的处理。详细内容姑不逐个列举。
    其原因，是由于掌握先决前提和基本原则不巩固，被追求节约字母总数、顾虑各种机械技术使用关系等等所动摇了，被北京音所限制了（也有削缩了北京音），被拉丁系各国语文的旧习惯所束缚了（也有抵触了一些原则）。
    我拥护拼音方案（草案）在理论上所提出的先决前提——“拼音方案多种用处”和“音素化”、“一素一标、一标一素”的基本原则。我反对拼音方案（草案）在实际上放弃了、破坏了这些先决前提和基本原则。（附图片）
