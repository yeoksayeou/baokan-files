As part of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, Workers' Families Must Take Action
Yang Zhihua, Director of the Women Workers Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions

The Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party proposed to launch an increase production and practice economy campaign throughout the Party and the country. Chairman Mao also called on everyone to maintain the fine tradition of hard work and plain living and to oppose extravagance and waste. Now, people from all walks of life across the country are actively responding to the Party's call with practical actions and joining this campaign.

On June 4th this year, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Democratic Women's Federation will hold a national conference of workers' family representatives in Beijing. Various regions will elect representatives to attend the conference around International Women's Day on March 8th. We believe that all workers' family sisters will actively respond to the Party's call with practical actions to increase production and practice economy, and make greater contributions.

The increase production and practice economy campaign is not a one-off sprint task, but a long-term policy for our socialist construction, and also a regular task for every male and female citizen. As everyone knows, old China was an agricultural country with a very weak industrial base and a low level of culture and technology. The past foundation was too poor. To build a strong socialist industrialized country is a very arduous task. However, for the benefit of all the people, we can only take the path of socialist industrialization. Because with the development of heavy industry, agriculture can be greatly developed. The development of agriculture will also help to develop light and heavy industries, thereby improving labor productivity, and on this basis, improving the lives of all the people. This is the reason why we should support the socialist system, take the socialist road, and not take the capitalist road. Capitalist industrialization is to make a fortune for a few big capitalists, and takes the form of exploiting and oppressing the domestic people, and plundering and occupying small and weak countries to obtain wealth. The fundamental method adopted by socialist industrialization is to rely on the labor of all the people themselves, to strive to increase production, practice strict economy, accumulate national funds, and expand production.

The task of increasing production and practicing economy is to be completed by the working class in factories and mines. The families of workers have a close relationship with the production and life of workers. The quality of life, health, and mental well-being of workers in the family will directly affect production, and the quality of production of each worker will directly affect the speed of national construction. Therefore, the idea of some workers' families that "the increase production and practice economy campaign is a matter for men, and has nothing to do with us women" is wrong. At the same time, we must not forget that only when production develops can the lives of our people be further improved. Therefore, letting workers do a good job in production is not only beneficial to the country, but also beneficial to us personally. Facts have proven that workers' families have played a significant role in completing previous increase production and practice economy tasks. For example, workers' families in coal mines, railways, and other industries have paid attention to conservation. They have universally replaced small light bulbs in their homes, correcting the bad habit of not turning off the lights at night. According to the latest nine-month statistics from the Hegang mining area alone, more than 420,200 kilowatt-hours of electricity were saved. Coal mine workers have never paid much attention to saving coal for domestic use, but because their families have raised their awareness and actively responded to the country's call for conservation, the families of workers in the Hegang mining area learned the method of the Deng Yufen group's stove set, saving 75 tons of coal in five months. When the Baotou Machinery Factory lacked raw materials, the families of workers found a lot of scrap iron in the ash and sand inside and outside the factory. More than 200 families automatically picked scrap iron for the factory. Three times, they picked a total of 15,000 kilograms of iron, and also picked up 15,000 kilograms of coal. Their efforts alleviated the tight situation of insufficient raw materials in the factory. The family members of a certain tungsten mine took the initiative to hand over the surplus production tools and equipment placed at home to the mine. In May and June of last year, the families of the entire mine handed over 222 carbide lamps, 291 useful tools for production, 64 kilograms of old Martin tools, 21 kilograms of old foreign nails, 359 kilograms of scrap steel, and 131 kilograms of coarse and fine sand. It supplied the factory's production needs. These all demonstrate the high patriotic enthusiasm of workers' families.

In recent years, many of our workers' families have maintained the fine tradition of working women, encouraged workers to attend work, and played a considerable role in increasing production and practicing economy. After the "Five Goods" were promoted in various places this year, some families who were not very concerned about production in the past are now actively serving production, and those who did not know how to manage their lives in the past are now practicing planned expenditures. For example, Luo Mingying, a family member of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, has four children and a family of six. Initially, her husband's salary was low and life was difficult. In recent years, due to her thriftiness, spinning yarn, and raising pigs, her family income has increased, and with the increase in her husband's salary, her life has greatly improved. Her husband, due to the good family arrangements, concentrated on learning, and was promoted from an ordinary clerk to an economic planner, and was elected as an advanced worker at the provincial and municipal levels last year.

Economy is multifaceted, and we cannot ignore anything from the individual to the country, from small economies to large economies. For example, there is a worker's family member named Li Yanping in Caoyang New Village in Shanghai. After moving into Caoyang New Village in the second half of 1953, she returned the packaging paper bags from each purchase to the store for reuse. For more than three years, she has returned a total of more than 100 paper bags to the store, saving paper for the country. Li Yanping's ordinary little thing showed the advanced idea of saving paper for the country. This spirit of saving public property is worthy of everyone's learning.

Broken cloth, broken glass, waste toothpaste tubes, and broken iron pieces are common in families. These things are indeed useless when placed at home, but if we can accumulate small amounts into large amounts, and regularly pay attention to collecting them and dedicate them to or sell them to the country, it is a great wealth. Because many waste products are good raw materials for industrial production after processing. For example, waste paper and broken cloth can be used to make paper; broken copper and scrap iron can be re-smelted into metal raw materials; chicken and duck feathers can be exported after processing. Therefore, paying attention to collecting waste and utilizing waste is also a concrete patriotic action.

Promoting family sideline production can not only increase the income of workers' families, solve the living difficulties of some workers and their families, and reduce the expenditure of national relief funds, but also some sideline productions, such as raising pigs, chickens, cattle, sheep, growing vegetables, etc., can also help the country solve the difficulties of insufficient supply of some non-staple foods. For example, at the Urqihan Station of the railway department, due to the difficulty in supplying vegetables there, workers and their families often could not eat green vegetables, which affected their health. Since the family members organized vegetable production, not only could the workers and family members in the entire area eat one and a quarter pounds of green vegetables per person per day, but there were also leftover vegetables to sell. These practices are beneficial to the country and to individuals. Of course, the organization of sideline production should be carried out according to the specific conditions of each region and each factory and mine. We must adapt to local conditions and diversify. At the beginning of the organization, in addition to the active efforts of the family members themselves, the administration and the trade union need to provide necessary support and leadership.

At present, some workers' family members believe that: "We can't manage the big savings, as for the small savings, our current life is not well-off, let alone waste, so how can we save." Yes, we should admit that some workers and their families are still living a relatively difficult life, but we cannot deny that there is still waste in factories and mines and in families. For example, many valuable raw materials were found in the garbage dumps outside the Changchun Automobile Factory. Many industrial and mining enterprises have similar situations; as long as we pay attention, we will find many loopholes for waste. The phenomenon of family waste also exists. For example, after Xuzhou City supplemented grain in the second half of last year, some family members dumped the remaining steamed buns and rice in the trash can; individual family members used materials from construction sites as firewood. If we pay attention to the family life of cadres in various agencies, it can be said that the situation of wasting water, electricity, and grain is not individual.

As workers' families of the leading class of the country - the working class, we should establish the idea of being the masters of the country together with the workers. We cannot turn a blind eye to these phenomena that damage the interests of the country. We must boldly put forward opinions and strengthen the supervisory role of the trade union. We must regard the difficulties of the country as our own difficulties, and resolutely oppose any behavior that is not conducive to factories and mines and not conducive to national construction, and block all loopholes for waste.

It is worth mentioning that a small number of workers' family members are developing a bad habit, comparing eating and wearing, and paying attention to ostentation, often complaining that their husbands do not earn enough, and even quarreling with their husbands. This phenomenon will inevitably affect the production of workers. We hope that all workers' families will learn from the advanced working class and carry forward the inherent fine style of hard work and plain living of working women.

Some family members mistakenly believe that "when the increase production and practice economy campaign comes, others will manage what to buy." Our advocacy of hard work and plain living does not mean that we cannot improve our lives. Especially after the wage reform last year, the income of most workers has increased. Under the condition of economic conditions permitting, it is still appropriate to improve life. Necessary things can also be bought. However, we must live frugally and save as much surplus money as possible in the bank.

Brothers and sisters of all workers' families, we must continue to use greater strength and practical actions to complete the national task of increasing production and practicing economy, and use this to welcome the national conference of workers' family representatives to be held in June this year!

### 在增产节约运动中职工家属要行动起来

    在增产节约运动中职工家属要行动起来
    中华全国总工会女工部部长　杨之华
    党的八届二中全会提出要在全党和全国开展增产节约运动，毛主席还号召大家要保持艰苦朴素的优良传统，反对铺张浪费。现在全国各阶层人民，都以实际行动积极地响应党的号召，投入了这个运动。
    今年6月4日，中华全国总工会和中华全国民主妇女联合会，将在北京召开全国职工家属代表会议。各地将在三八国际劳动妇女节前后，选出参加会议的代表。我们相信全体职工家属姊妹们，一定会以增产节约的实际行动积极响应党的号召，作出更大的贡献。
    增产节约运动，不是一朝一夕的突击任务，而是我们建设社会主义长远的方针，也是每个男女公民的经常工作。大家知道，旧中国是一个工业基础很薄弱、文化技术水平很低的农业国；过去的家底子太差了，要建立一个强大的社会主义工业化的国家，是一个非常艰巨的任务。但是为了全体人民的利益，只有走社会主义工业化的道路。因为有了重工业的发展，才能大大发展农业，农业发展了，也就有助于发展轻重工业，从而提高劳动生产率，并在这个基础上，来改善全体人民的生活。这就是我们要拥护社会主义制度，走社会主义道路，不走资本主义道路的道理。资本主义的工业化，是为少数大资本家发财，并且采取剥削和压迫国内人民、掠夺和侵占弱小国家来获得资财。而社会主义工业化所采取的根本办法，是依靠全体人民自己的劳动，努力增加生产，厉行节约，积累国家资金，扩大生产。
    增产节约的任务，对厂矿企业来说，是依靠工人阶级来完成的。而职工家属和职工的生产生活有着密切的关系。职工在家庭中生活的好坏，身体的健康状况，精神的愉快等等，都会直接影响到生产，而每个职工生产的好坏，又直接影响到国家建设速度的快慢。因此，有的职工家属认为“增产节约运动是爷儿们的事，与我娘们无关”的思想是不对的。同时，我们也不能忘记，只有生产发展了，我们人民的生活才能进一步得到改善。所以让职工把生产搞好，不但对国家有利，对我们个人来说也是有利的。事实已经证明，在完成过去历次增产节约任务中，职工家属起了很大的作用。如煤矿、铁路等各产业职工家属，注意了节约，在家庭里普遍地改用了小灯泡，纠正了过去夜间不息灯睡觉的不好习惯。鹤岗矿区仅据最近九个月的统计：就节省了四十二万零二千多度电。煤矿职工生活用煤向来是不大注意节约的，但由于家属们提高了觉悟，积极响应国家的节约号召，鹤岗矿区职工家属学习了邓玉芬小组套炉堂的办法，五个月就节省了七十五吨煤。包头机械厂原料不足的时候，职工家属们从厂内厂外灰砂中发现了好多碎铁，二百多个家属自动地为厂子拣废铁，前后三次，共拣铁一万五千斤，附带还拣得煤炭一万五千斤。由于她们的努力，缓和了厂内原料不足的紧张情况。某钨矿的家属主动把放在家里的多余的各种生产工具和器材踊跃交给矿上，在去年五、六月份，全矿家属交出来的电石灯就有二百二十二盏，各种生产上有用的工具二百九十一件，旧马丁六十四公斤，旧洋钉二十一公斤，废钢铁三百五十九公斤，还有花砂、净砂共计一百三十一公斤。供应了厂内生产上的需要。这些都表现了职工家属高度的爱国热情。
    几年来，我们许多职工家属，保持着劳动妇女的优良传统，鼓励职工出勤，在增产节约中起了相当大的作用。今年各地宣传“五好”以后，过去有些不大关心生产的家属，现在积极为生产服务，原来不会过日子的，现在也做到计划开支。如哈尔滨机车车辆修理厂的家属骆明英，她有四个孩子，六口人；最初她爱人的工资较低，生活较苦。几年来，由于她的勤俭持家，纺线、养猪，增加了家庭收入，加上她爱人工资增长，生活有了很大的改善。她爱人由于家庭安排的很好，安心学习，也从一个普通的事务员，提升为经济计划员，而且在去年被选为省、市级的先进工作者。
    节约是多方面的，从个人到国家，从小节约到大节约都不能忽视。如上海曹杨新村有一位职工家属名叫李燕平，她在1953年下半年搬进曹杨新村以后，把每次买东西的包装纸袋送回店里再度使用，三年多来，一共给店里送回了一百多只纸袋，为国家节约了纸张。李燕平这样一件平凡的小事，表现了为国家节省纸张的先进思想。这种爱护公共财物的节约精神，是值得大家学习的。
    家庭中的破布、碎玻璃、废牙膏管、烂铁片都是常有的，这些东西放在家里确是毫无用处，但是如果我们能够积少成多，经常的注意收集起来，献给或卖给国家，却是一笔大财富。因为很多废品，经过加工后都是工业生产上的好原料。像废纸、破布可以造纸；破铜烂铁还可以重新炼成金属原料；鸡鸭的羽毛，经过加工，可以出口。因此，注意收集废物，利用废物，也是一件具体的爱国行动。
    提倡家属进行副业生产，不但可以增加职工家庭的收入，解决部分职工和家属生活困难，减少了国家救济费的开支，而且某些副业生产，如养猪、鸡、牛、羊、种菜等等，还可以帮助国家解决部分副食品供应不足的困难。如铁路部门乌尔旗汗站，由于那里的蔬菜供应困难，职工和家属经常吃不到青菜，影响了身体健康。自从家属组织种菜生产后，不但全区的职工和家属每人每天能吃上一斤四两青菜，而且还有剩余的菜出卖。这些作法对国家对个人都是有益处的。当然，组织副业生产，应该根据各个地区各个厂矿的具体条件进行。要因地制宜，多种多样。在开始组织时，除家属群众自己积极努力外，需要行政和工会给予必要的支持和领导。
    目前，有的职工家属认为：“大节约我们管不了，至于小节约呢，我们目前生活并不宽裕，更谈不上浪费，又怎样节约”。是的，我们应当承认部分职工和家属目前还是过着比较艰苦的生活，但是我们也不能否认在厂矿和家庭中，都还存在着浪费的情况。例如在长春汽车厂厂外的垃圾堆里，发现了很多宝贵的原材料。许多工矿企业中都有类似情况；只要我们去注意一下，就会发现许多浪费的漏洞。家庭浪费的现象也是存在的，像徐州市去年下半年增补粮食后，有的家属就把剩下的馒头、米饭倒在垃圾箱里；有个别家属拿工地上材料当柴烧。如果在各个机关都来注意一下干部们的家庭生活，可以说那种浪费水、电、粮食等情况并不是个别的。
    作为国家领导阶级——工人阶级的职工家属们，我们应当和职工共同树立起国家主人翁的思想，对于这些有损国家利益的现象，我们不能熟视无睹，要大胆地提出意见，加强工会的监督作用。我们要把国家的困难看成是自己的困难，对于任何不利于厂矿，不利于国家建设的行为，都要坚决反对，把一切浪费的漏洞都堵住。
    值得提起注意的是，有少数的职工家属，正在滋长着一种不好的风气，比吃比穿，讲究排场，往往为此而埋怨丈夫挣的少，甚至和丈夫吵闹。这种现象，必然要影响职工的生产。我们希望所有职工家属向先进的工人阶级看齐，发扬劳动妇女固有的艰苦朴素的优良作风。
    有的家属误认为“增产节约运动来了，买东西别人要管了”。我们提倡艰苦朴素，不等于说就不能改善生活了，特别是去年工资改革后，大部分职工的收入增加了，在经济条件许可的情况下，适当地改善生活还是应该的。必需的东西也是可以买的。但是，必须勤俭过日子，尽可能把有多余的钱储蓄到银行里。
    全体职工家属兄弟姊妹们，我们要以更大力量继续以实际的行动来完成国家增产节约的任务，并以此来迎接今年6月召开的全国职工家属代表会议！
