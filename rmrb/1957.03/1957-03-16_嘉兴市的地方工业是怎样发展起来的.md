    How Jiaxing City's Local Industry Developed
    Zhang Zhifen
    In the early days of liberation, Jiaxing City had only a dozen private factories. Now, the city has fifty factories of all sizes. According to statistics from twenty-four factories, the industrial output value is 30.022 million yuan, and the profit is 957,000 yuan. The industrial output value accounts for 99.71% of the city's total industrial and agricultural output value. These factories produce no less than a hundred varieties of products. The main products include white filature silk, machine-made paper, spun silk, cotton cloth, towels, socks, edible oil, non-edible oil, granular fertilizer, diesel engines, rice threshers, water pumps, white wine, yellow wine, saccharin, adhesive tape powder, and twenty-one other kinds. Some of these products have been sold far and wide, both domestically and abroad.
    The ranks of factory workers have grown from 3,670 in 1952 to 8,144, and there are more than 4,000 residents who provide fixed processing services for the factories. This is the most important factor in fundamentally solving the city's unemployment problem.
    Of the city's fifty factories of all sizes, besides the Minfeng Paper Mill, Spun Silk Factory, China Silk Factory, Jiaxing Oil Factory, Minsheng Oil Factory, and the Power Plant, the other factories are newly built or renovated. Some of these factories were transformed from wholesalers using the original handicraft industry foundation; some were renovated through economic reorganization; some resumed production using the original factory sites; and some developed through production for self-salvation. The common point of these factories is that most of them are of a public-private partnership nature. They have all experienced a gradual development process from scratch, from small to large. In other words, the vast majority started "empty-handed."
    The first important thing in running an enterprise is to solve the funding problem. Most of the factories in the city did not receive any state investment during their construction or renovation. It was only from 1953 that the state gradually invested more than 1.9 million yuan. Some people may ask, "Can industry be established without state investment?" The facts give us the answer: yes, it can, and it has already been established.
    As the saying goes, "The poor have their own ways." The first method is to use the funds and personnel of declining and obsolete industries to transform into factories. This not only absorbs funds but also facilitates the arrangement of personnel in these industries. For example, the Wufeng Salt Shop, a wholesaler, transformed into a paper pulp factory, and the Tongyuanfu Kerosene Shop transformed into the Tongyuanfu Battery Factory, and so on.
    The second method: demobilized soldiers and some unemployed people in society requested to run factories in the form of production for self-salvation. Considering that there were not many difficulties in supply, production, and sales, we vigorously supported them. In addition to contributing some of their own funds, we mainly lent them some money from the unemployment relief fund. After the enterprise was established, it was repaid to the state year by year. In this way, the relief fund is no longer just passively solving some temporary living difficulties, but can enable more people to engage in production. The thread weaving factory started with a technician and a group of residents, allocated some unemployment relief funds.
    The third method is to borrow some funds from other larger enterprises to run factories. For example, the Nanhu Cloth Factory borrowed more than 10,000 yuan from the Minfeng Paper Mill and the Power Plant to resume production.
    The fourth method is to absorb local idle funds. For example, the Waterworks and the Chemical Factory were established by absorbing local idle funds and providing a small amount of loans from banks.
    The second important thing in running an enterprise is to solve the problem of factory buildings. In the case of limited funds, the general approach is to find abandoned temples, dilapidated ancestral halls, and borrow civilian houses to solve the problem. For example, the factory building of the Jiaxing Printing Factory was the former Lanxi Guild Hall. The factory building of the paper pulp factory was a dilapidated ancestral hall. Although the Nanhu Cloth Factory had an old factory site, it had been idle for several years, and the weeds growing in the factory were half a person tall. During the renovation, the workers sold the old things in the original factory to repair the factory buildings. The workers' dormitories had no glass windows, so they used broken mats and straw bags to block the windows. With these methods, the factory buildings were solved.
    Equipment and utensils are also indispensable for running a factory. There were no ready-made equipment, and the machinery and equipment received from bureaucratic capital were only a small part. At that time, we mainly relied on the two hands of the masses to solve the problem by cleaning up and repairing the old machinery in the warehouse. We also borrowed and transferred some from factories, units, residents, and workers' own homes that had surplus machinery and utensils. The paper pulp factory's grass cutter was converted from old machinery by unemployed workers according to the principle of a rice mill. When the Nanhu Cloth Factory first opened, the stools used by the workers for production and the bowls and chopsticks used for life were all brought to the factory by themselves. With the addition of a small amount of machinery and equipment, the problem was solved. Most of the factories did not have engineering and technical personnel assigned to them by the state when they opened. However, the wisdom of the masses is infinite. They went everywhere to invite unemployed technical personnel and "experts" to work in the factories, and at the same time, they learned while producing. The colored thread handbags produced by the thread weaving factory imitated the colors and styles of straw bags and leather bags produced in various places, and they also took out the patterns on the ancient towels and floral fabrics to study and continuously improve the colors and varieties.
    Another reason why these enterprises were able to be established is that the management is simple and there are few management personnel. In some factories, the management personnel are also production workers. In addition to this, there is only one factory director, or outstanding workers with certain abilities selected from the workers as the person in charge, and then the departments are gradually established. Like the printing factory, there was only one factory director at the beginning. The factory director took charge of the business, and the others were production workers. In terms of workers' wages, living, and welfare, generally, when the factory first opened, the workers voluntarily took a small amount of wages or no wages. When the Nanhu Cloth Factory opened in 1952, the workers only ate meals and did not take wages. More than fifty workers ate only one jin of vegetable oil a month. Now, the average monthly wage of all 263 employees in the factory is nearly 40 yuan.
    Jiaxing City has gained the following experiences in studying and summarizing the development of these factories:
    1. These factories were created by the masses and supported by the leadership. Running factories should also follow the mass line. As long as the masses consciously run factories, there is no way they cannot be run well. Take the paper pulp factory as an example. The masses demanded to run it, and the local industrial department gave support in terms of funds, cadres, and political leadership. They found ancestral halls to use as factory buildings, modified old machines, and learned technology. All the difficulties in running the factory were solved. Now, this factory turns over more than 40,000 yuan in profits to the state every year.
    2. From scratch to large scale, small investment and large returns. When the factories were first established, the factory buildings and machinery and equipment were relatively old, and some were even borrowed, and the technology was generally backward. But it can be gradually improved. The management of the factory also adapts to the needs of production, without paying attention to ostentation. Production develops year by year, factory equipment gradually increases, management level gradually improves, and wages and benefits gradually increase. This is a method of using the factory to support the factory, which is in line with the principle of "diligence and frugality in running enterprises."
    3. Many enterprises have to go through a difficult process in the development process. Those who lead industrial production must have a clear mind and analyze whether this is a fundamental difficulty or a temporary difficulty; if it is a temporary difficulty, they must organize the masses to overcome this difficulty, and do not be confused by temporary difficulties, and keep yelling about "carrying a burden." On this issue, Jiaxing City has had lessons: when the brick and tile factory encountered temporary difficulties in production, it was thought that running this factory was a burden, and there was no active leadership, and as a result, the factory collapsed.

    嘉兴市的地方工业是怎样发展起来的
    张志芬
    解放初期，嘉兴市只有十多家私营工厂，现在全市已有大小工厂五十家了。据二十四个厂统计，工业产值就有三千零二十二万元，利润有九十五万七千元，工业产值占全市工农业产值的99.71％。这些工厂生产的品种不下百余种。主要产品有白厂丝、机制纸、绢丝、棉布、毛巾、袜子、食用油、非食用油、颗粒肥料、柴油机、打稻机、水泵、白酒、黄酒、糖精、胶布粉等二十一种。这些产品有的已经远销国内外。
    工厂工人的队伍从1952年的三千六百七十人增长到八千一百四十四人，给工厂固定加工产品的居民有四千多人。这是使得全市失业问题基本解决的一个最重要的因素。
    全市的五十个大小工厂，除了民丰、绢纺、中丝、嘉兴油厂、民生油厂、电厂十多个工厂以外，其他工厂都是新建、改建的。这些工厂有的是通过改造批发商利用原有手工业基础转办工厂的；有的是通过经济改组而改建的；有的是利用原有厂基恢复生产的；有的则是依靠生产自救发展起来的。这些厂的共同之点，就是大部分都是属于民办公助性质。它们都经历了从无到有、从小到大逐步发展的过程。也就是说绝大部分都是“白手”起家的。
    办企业第一桩要紧事情是解决资金问题。全市绝大部分厂在新建改建的时候，国家就没有投什么资金。只是从1953年起，国家才陆续投入了一百九十多万元资金。有人要问：“没有国家投资，能办起工业来吗？”事实给我们的答复是：能够，而且已经办起来了。
    俗语说“穷有穷办法”。第一个办法是利用没落、淘汰行业的资金、人员来转办工厂，这样不但吸收了资金，也有利于对这些行业人员的安排。例如：批发商五丰盐号转办纸筋厂、同源福煤油号转办同源福电池厂等等。
    第二个办法：复员军人、社会上的一些失业人员要求以生产自救方式办工厂，我们考虑到供产销没有多大困难，就大力支持他们办。除了他们自己拿出一部分资金外，主要在失业救济金中借给他们一部分钱。等企业办起来以后，逐年还给国家。这样救济金就不再只是消极的解决一些暂时的生活困难，而且能使更多的人投入生产。线织厂开始的时候，是一个技工、一部分居民，拨了一部分失业救济金办起来的。
    第三个办法是向其他较大的企业借一部分资金办厂。如南湖布厂就是向民丰纸厂、电厂借了一万多元钱才复厂的。
    第四个办法是吸收地方游资。如自来水厂、化工厂等就是吸收地方游资和银行给予少量贷款办起来的。
    办企业第二桩要紧事情是解决厂房问题。在资金有限的情况下一般采取找荒庙、破祠堂，借用民房来解决。例如嘉兴印刷厂的厂房就是过去的兰溪会馆。纸筋厂的厂房就是个破祠堂。像南湖布厂虽然有旧厂基，但闲置已经好几年，厂内长的野草，就有半人高。改建时工人把原来厂里的破东西卖了钱来修理厂房。工人宿舍没有玻璃窗，就用破席草包挡窗子。就是用这些办法，厂房也就解决了。
    设备、用具也是办工厂所不可缺少的，没有摆着的现成设备，从官僚资本手里接收来的机器设备只是极少一部分。那时我们主要依靠群众的两只手从清理和修理仓库废旧机器来解决。还向机器用具有多余的工厂、单位、居民、工人自己家里借用和调用一部分。纸筋厂的轧草机就是失业工人们按照碾米机的原理利用废旧机器改装成的。南湖布厂刚开厂的时候，工人生产用的凳子、生活用的碗筷都是自己带到厂里来用的。加上适当的添置一小部分机器设备，问题也就解决了。大部分工厂在开厂时，国家没有给他们派去工程技术人员，但是群众的智慧就是无穷无尽的。他们到各处去邀请失业的技术人员、“内行”到厂里去工作，同时自己边生产边学习。线织厂生产的花色线提包就是仿照各地出产的草包、皮包的花色式样，而且还把古老的手巾、花布上的花样拿出来研究，不断地改进花色品种。
    这些企业能够办起来的另一个原因是管理简单，管理人员少。有的工厂管理人员就是生产工人，除此之外，只有一个厂长，或从工人中挑选出来的有一定能力的优秀工人当负责人，以后才逐步建立了科室。像印刷厂，开始只有厂长一人。厂长一个人统管业务，其他的都是生产工人。在工人的工资生活福利方面，一般地刚开厂，工人都自愿拿少量工资或不拿工资。1952年南湖布厂开厂时，工人只吃饭不拿工资，五十多个工人一个月只吃一斤菜油。现在全厂二百六十三个职工平均每人每月工资将近四十元。
    嘉兴市在研究总结这些工厂的发展情况中得到以下几点体会：
    1、这些工厂都是由群众创造，领导支持办起来的。办工厂也要走群众路线。只要群众自觉地来办厂，没有办不好的。就拿纸筋厂来说，群众要求办，地方工业部门在资金、干部、政治领导各方面给予支持，自己找祠堂当厂房，改制旧机器，学习技术。办工厂的一切困难就迎刃而解了。现在这个厂一年就上缴给国家四万多元的利润。
    2、从无到有，从小到大，投资少、收效大。工厂刚办起来的时候厂房机器设备都比较陈旧，有的甚至是借来的，技术一般较落后。但是可以逐步提高。工厂的管理也适应生产的需要，不讲究排场，生产逐年发展，工厂设备逐渐增加、管理水平逐年提高，工资福利也逐渐增长。这是一种以厂养厂的办法，是符合“勤俭办企业”的方针的。
    3、有不少的企业在发展过程中都要经过一个困难的历程，领导工业生产的人就要头脑清醒，分析这是根本困难还是暂时的困难；如果是暂时的困难就要组织群众克服这个困难，不要为一时的困难迷糊了视听，光嚷着“背包袱”。在这个问题上，嘉兴市就有过教训：办砖瓦厂遇到了生产上一时的困难，就以为办这个厂是背包袱了，没有积极领导，结果工厂垮了台。
