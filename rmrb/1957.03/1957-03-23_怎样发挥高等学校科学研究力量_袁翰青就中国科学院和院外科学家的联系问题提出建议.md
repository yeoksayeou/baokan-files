How to Leverage the Scientific Research Strength of Universities
Yuan Hanqing proposes suggestions on the connection between the Chinese Academy of Sciences and scientists outside the Academy

Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

I fully endorse the reports made by Chairman Zhou Enlai and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong at this meeting.

At this meeting, several committee members have expressed valuable opinions on issues related to scientific research, and I would also like to offer some supplementary opinions on this aspect.

We acknowledge our backwardness, which allows us to catch up with extra speed

Natural science in ancient China had brilliant achievements. In modern times, China has lagged behind in science. Since liberation, although we have made some progress in scientific research, we are still far behind. We only need to cite one situation to roughly understand the extent of China's backwardness in modern science. It is estimated that in 1956 alone, about 1.8 million research papers with creative content were published in natural science journals worldwide. Among such a huge number of papers, the works of Chinese scientists account for less than 1%. Compared with scientifically advanced countries, China's scientific research work is quite small in quantity, and the quality is generally not high.

Generally speaking, China's natural science is about thirty years behind the most scientifically advanced countries in the world. We acknowledge our backwardness, which allows us to catch up with extra speed. We have a superior socialist system, which provides the most basic favorable conditions, guaranteeing that China can be raised from a scientifically backward foundation to a level close to the modern advanced level in the shortest possible time.

Last year, 1956, under the leadership of the Party, China's scientific community carried out a detailed work to enable science to develop in a planned way in China, formulated a long-term plan for the development of science and technology, and proposed 57 important scientific and technological tasks that require the cooperation of various scientific departments to solve. The amount of work required to achieve the long-term plan is very huge.

A successful Academy of Sciences should be the Academy of Sciences of all the scientists in the country, and assisting scientific research in universities is one of its important tasks.

Guaranteeing the gradual realization of the scientific development plan, one of the keys lies in how to mobilize the existing people who can engage in scientific research work, so that they can exert their greatest potential. This involves the system of scientific research work and the deployment of human resources. These issues must be thoroughly discussed to obtain the correct answers. I am not prepared to discuss these issues. I just want to express some opinions on how the Academy of Sciences should assist universities so that the scientific research strength in universities can be brought into play.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences has not done enough in this regard.

From the history of the development of academies of sciences in various countries, a successful academy of sciences should be the academy of sciences of the scientists of the country, and not just the academy of sciences of the scientists within the academy. The earliest academy of sciences in the world was the Florentine Academy of Sciences, founded in 1657. The second earliest was the British Royal Society, which was not called an academy of sciences but had the reality of an academy of sciences, established in 1662. Later, various European countries established academies of sciences one after another. The early academies of sciences did not have affiliated research institutions, but were honorary organizations in the scientific community. Due to the rapid development of modern science, some academies of sciences have retained the nature of honorary organizations and also lead affiliated research units to engage in scientific work. Because the Academy of Sciences is an organization of scientists, scientists in the country, no matter where they work, regard the Academy of Sciences of their country as their own organization. This makes the Academy of Sciences and the scientists of the country have a close connection.

In any country, scientists working in research units within the Academy of Sciences are only a small part of the scientists in the country. Most scientists are scattered in various work positions, among which scientists who are professors in universities are the most numerous. The situation in China is also the same. The number of scientists who are professors and associate professors in universities in China is about fourteen times the number of senior researchers in the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Therefore, if the Chinese Academy of Sciences can regard assisting universities in conducting scientific research as one of its important tasks, the Chinese Academy of Sciences will be enthusiastically supported by scientists across the country and will have a great promoting effect on the development of science in China.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences is still a young academy of sciences. Since its establishment, it has done a lot of work and made considerable contributions to the country's scientific undertaking. This is an achievement that no one can deny. As far as the connection with scientists outside the academy is concerned, some efforts have also been made. For example, the establishment of academic divisions, the awarding of science prizes, and the establishment of research institutions in cooperation with universities are all measures related to scientists outside the academy. However, the number of scientists outside the academy recruited by the academic divisions is ultimately limited, science prizes are rewards after achievements have been made, and institutions established in cooperation still need the signboard of the Academy of Sciences. These measures are good, but they all have a certain degree of limitations in assisting scientific research in universities.

Use the Science Foundation model to help scientists conduct research.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed to the current stage and already has 67 research units under its own leadership. In the past, it was necessary for the Academy of Sciences to put its main strength in establishing institutions, but in the future it should broaden its horizons and regard the development of science in the whole country as the development of the Academy. The Academy of Sciences should at least be able to play the role of a science foundation in some countries for scientists in universities.

What is a science foundation? Generally, science foundations provide unconditional assistance in manpower and material resources to experienced and talented scientists, so that they have sufficient working conditions in their original positions to conduct scientific research. The Academy of Sciences cannot administratively lead the national scientific research undertaking, but it has the unshirkable responsibility to lead academically. Using the method of science foundations increases the material basis for carrying out academic leadership.

Since both are treasury expenditures, why should they be transferred by the Academy of Sciences? First, the higher education budget is already a considerable figure, and it is difficult to expect a large increase in funding in the short term to be distributed to various universities as research funding. Also, since the higher education administrative department mainly provides administrative leadership to universities, it is difficult to provide in-depth academic leadership, and it is difficult to expect a very appropriate allocation of scientific research funding. Therefore, using the scientific funding of the Academy of Sciences to play the role of a science foundation for universities can best achieve the ideal of making the best use of people's talents and material resources.

There is still a lot of scientific research potential in China's universities that has not been brought into play. The lack of working conditions and the lack of assistants make these scientists feel difficult. In the past few years, the relationship between the Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Higher Education has been somewhat strained. Generally, there are more voices criticizing the departmentalism of the Ministry of Higher Education, but the Academy of Sciences is not without responsibility. In the past, the Academy of Sciences mainly focused on transferring scientists to universities. Appropriate transfer of people is necessary. However, "transfer" is only one of the ways to "mobilize" human resources. The Academy of Sciences should have a variety of ways to mobilize the strength of scientists outside the academy.

If the Academy of Sciences vigorously adopts the method of science foundations to assist in research for scientists in universities, it will have a certain effect on the development of China's scientific undertaking.

My opinion may not be correct, and I would like to ask everyone for guidance. (Attached picture)

    怎样发挥高等学校科学研究力量
    袁翰青就中国科学院和院外科学家的联系问题提出建议主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全拥护周恩来主席和陈叔通副主席在这次会议上所做的报告。
    在这次会议上，有好几位委员对于有关科学研究的问题发表了宝贵的意见，我也想就这方面的问题，提出一点补充意见。
    我们承认落后，正可以快马加鞭地赶上前去
    自然科学在我国古代是有过辉煌的成就的。到了近代，我国在科学上是落后了。解放以来，我们在科学研究工作上，虽然赶了一程，可是仍然落后得很远。我们只要举一点情况，就可以大体了解我国在现代科学方面落后的程度。据估计，1956年一年内全世界所有自然科学期刊上发表的研究论文，具有创造性的内容的，大概在一百八十万篇左右。在这样巨大数量的论文之中，我国科学家的著作到不了百分之一。跟科学先进各国比起来，我国的科学研究工作在数量上是相当少的，质量一般也不高。
    大体说来，我国的自然科学比世界上科学最先进的国家，落后了三十年的样儿。我们承认落后，正可以快马加鞭地赶上前去。我们有优越的社会主义制度，这就具备了最基本的有利条件，保证把我国从科学落后的基础上，在尽可能短的时期内，提高到接近于现代先进水平。
    在去年，1956年，我国科学界在党的领导之下，为使科学在我国有计划地发展，进行了一项细致的工作，拟订了科学技术发展远景规划，提出了五十七项重要的科学技术任务，需要各个科学部门配合起来解决。远景规划的实现，所需工作量是十分浩大的。
    一个成功的科学院应该是全国科学家的科学院，协助高等学校科学研究是它的重要任务之一。
    保证科学发展规划的逐步实现，关键之一在于如何调动现有的能够从事科学研究工作的人，使他们能发挥出最大的潜力。这里牵涉到科学研究工作的体制问题和人力的部署问题。这些问题必须经过详细的讨论才能得到正确的答案。我不准备讨论这些问题。我只想就科学院应当如何协助高等学校，使高等学校里的科学研究力量能够发挥出来这一问题，发表一点意见。
    中国科学院在这一方面还是做得不够的。
    从各国科学院发展的历史来看，一个成功的科学院应当是本国科学家的科学院，而决不仅仅是院内科学家的科学院。世界上最早的一个科学院是1657年创建的佛罗棱萨科学院，次早的是不以科学院为名而有科学院之实的英国皇家学会，1662年成立。后来欧洲各国都纷纷成立了科学院。早期的科学院并不附设研究机构，乃是科学界的荣誉组织。由于近代科学发展的迅速，有些科学院既保留了荣誉组织的性质，还领导附设的研究单位从事科学工作。因为科学院是科学家的组织，所以本国的科学家不论工作岗位在哪里，都把本国的科学院看成自己的组织。这就使得科学院和全国的科学家发生了紧密的联系。
    无论在哪一个国家，在科学院内研究单位工作的科学家只是全国科学家中的一小部分，大部分科学家分散在各个不同的工作岗位上，其中尤以在高等学校担任教授的科学家为最多。我国的情形也是如此。我国在高等学校任教授和副教授的科学家的人数约十四倍于在中国科学院任高级研究人员的人数。因此，中国科学院如果能把协助高等学校进行科学研究视为自己的重要任务之一，中国科学院将受到全国科学家的热烈拥护而对于我国科学的发展将发生很大的推动作用。
    中国科学院还是一个年轻的科学院，成立以来，做了不少工作，对于国家的科学事业有相当大的贡献。这是谁也不能否认的成绩。就对于院外科学家的联系来说，也作了一些努力。例如成立学部、颁发科学奖金、与高等学校合作建立研究机构等等，都是与院外科学家有关的一些措施。可是学部委员所罗致的院外科学家终属有限，科学奖金是已有成就之后的奖励，合作建立的机构还得有科学院的招牌。这些措施是好的，但对协助高等学校的科学研究说来，都具有一定程度的局限性。
    采用科学基金会的方式帮助科学家进行研究。
    中国科学院发展到现阶段，已经有了自行领导的六十七个研究单位了。在过去，科学院的主要力量放在建立机构方面是必要的，可是今后它应当把眼界放宽，把全国科学的发展，看成就是院的发展。科学院对于高等学校里的科学家至少应当可以起科学基金会在有些国家所起的作用。
    科学基金会是什么一回事呢？一般的科学基金会对于有经验的有才华的科学家无条件地给以人力物力的帮助，使他们在原岗位有足够的工作条件，进行科学研究。科学院在行政上是无法领导全国的科学研究事业的，在学术上，义不容辞地负有领导的责任。利用科学基金会的方式增加了进行学术领导的物质基础的力量。
    同是国库开支，为什么要由科学院转手呢？一则高等教育经费已经是很不小的数字，短期内难望再增加大量的经费，分给各校作为研究费用。又由于高等教育行政部门对于高等学校主要是行政领导，难于作深入的学术领导，在科学研究经费的分配上也难望很确当。因此，通过科学院的科学经费来对高等学校起科学基金会的作用：最能达到人尽其才、物尽其用的理想。
    我国高等学校中还有很大的科学研究潜力没有发挥出来。工作条件的缺乏和助手的不够使这些科学家感到困难。这几年来，科学院和高等教育部的关系是有些紧张的。一般听到批评高教部本位主义的声音多些，其实科学院也不是没有责任的。科学院对于高等学校过去主要着眼于调用科学家。适当的调用人是必要的。可是“调用”仅是“调动”人力的方式之一。科学院调动院外科学家的力量应当有多种的方式。
    如果科学院对于高等学校的科学家，大力采用科学基金会的协助研究的办法，这对于我国科学事业的发展是会产生一定的作用的。
    我的意见可能不正确，提出来请大家指教。（附图片）
