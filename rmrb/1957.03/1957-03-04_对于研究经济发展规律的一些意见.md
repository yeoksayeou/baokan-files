Some Opinions on Studying the Laws of Economic Development
Su Xing

The task of political economy is to reveal the inherent regularity of objective economic processes through complex social phenomena. In principle, there is no disagreement on this issue. However, in our specific practices, judging from the articles published in recent years that discuss the laws of economic development, it seems that some issues have not been completely resolved. These issues include: First, whether the essence of socialist economic relations and the laws of socialist economic development have been thoroughly revealed; second, how to use the laws of economic development of a certain social formation that have been revealed from an economic science perspective to analyze the same economic formation; third, how to view using formulas to express the laws of economic development; fourth, whether it is necessary to study specific economic problems in order to understand the regularity of objective economic processes. These issues are all very large and involve the research object and research methods of political economy, so it is difficult to explain them clearly all at once. This article can only raise them, explain some of my own views, and provide them for discussion.

Is there no need for further scientific research on the laws of socialist economic development?

Regarding the study of socialist economics, some people have this view: Because socialist economic relations are based on the public ownership of the means of production, the essence of this relationship is clear at a glance. It seems that political economy does not need to conduct scientific research to reveal it. Others also believe that the laws of socialist economic development have been recognized, and the task of science is not to continue to discover and recognize the regularity of objective economic processes, but to study the forms in which these laws act or to study how to consciously utilize them.

I disagree with these views.

Indeed, socialist economic relations are much simpler than capitalist economic relations, because socialist society is composed of a single economic relationship; moreover, socialist economic relations are neither submerged by master-servant relationships like feudal society, nor covered up by buying and selling relationships like capitalist society. Judging from this situation alone, socialist economic relations can be considered clear at a glance. However, this is not the whole picture of socialist economic relations. Socialist economic relations include the relations of the entire production, distribution, exchange, and consumption process, which are quite complex. In particular, due to the existence of commodity production in the socialist economy, the relationship between people must still be expressed through commodity exchange within a certain range, so that people have to go through the study of economic categories such as commodities and currency to understand the relationships they embody. Therefore, fully revealing socialist economic relations still requires arduous scientific research work.

The research on production relations is like this, and so is the research on the laws of economic development. When the essence of production relations has not been fully revealed, it is naturally impossible to say that the laws of economic development have been fully recognized. There is no doubt that the Marxist-Leninist classics laid the theoretical cornerstone for our research on socialist economics, and revealed many important aspects of the laws of socialist economic development. These are extremely valuable legacies. However, we cannot say today that the laws of socialist economic development have been completely revealed. In actual economic life, there are many phenomena in the socialist economy that we cannot yet explain scientifically; the consequences of some of our major economic policies and economic measures are sometimes contrary to what was expected beforehand. This proves that our understanding of the regularity of socialist economic development is not deep or thorough enough. As for the many major theoretical issues in the socialist economy that are before our eyes, we have only just begun to study them. Why have the laws of socialist economic development not been fully revealed so far? I think this is mainly due to the following reasons: First, the socialist economy itself has not yet fully matured. Generally speaking, the history of socialist economic development is still not long. The Soviet Union is forty years old, the European people's democratic countries are only a little over ten years old, and we only have seven years. Socialism is a completely new social system. In the process of construction, there must be a process of groping for experience, so that many things have to be started from scratch. Lenin once said: "Before communism is fully realized, no form is the final form." This situation will inevitably limit the depth and breadth of our observation of problems and limit our understanding of objective economic laws. Second, research on socialist economics is not sufficient. Bourgeois economists, starting from mercantilism, have studied capitalist economics for about two and a half centuries. Marx critically accepted these legacies and spent forty years of labor to systematically reveal the laws of the emergence, development, and demise of capitalism. However, the research on socialist economics, starting from Marx and Engels, has only been a little over a hundred years. At that time, there was no socialist economy, and at most, only some scientific predictions could be made on socialist economics in principle. The real condition for conducting research on socialist economics was after the great October Socialist Revolution. In this regard, the scientific legacy left to us by Lenin and Stalin is quite rich. As for the research of economic scientists on socialist economics, although some materials have been accumulated and some achievements have been made so far, it is not very large. What we want to study is an entire social system, which requires more time and cannot be accomplished overnight.

Therefore, we cannot think that the laws of socialist economic development have been fully revealed, which will restrict our own hands and feet. For the study of the regularity of socialist economic processes, we must also be prepared to pay longer and more arduous labor.

Should we study the actual situation in our country, or only use some examples to prove certain conclusions?

In recent years, economic scientists in our country have a strong interest in the study of the laws of economic development, and have published many articles in this regard. Even now, when we open the scientific research plans of many universities and research institutions, we can still widely find such topics: the role of a certain socialist economic law or the law of value in the transition period of our country; the role of socialist economic laws in a specific economic sector; the objective basis of agricultural cooperativization and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce; the scientific basis of a certain policy and plan, etc. These articles and research topics have one thing in common: they all use the economic laws of a certain social formation that have been scientifically elucidated to analyze the same economic formation.

For the time being, let's not scrutinize the wording of these topics themselves. From a general point of view, political economy should be allowed to do such research, because the laws applicable to a certain mode of production also apply to all historical periods with the same mode of production. Since our country's transition period has both socialist economy and capitalist economy, we can of course use the already elucidated laws of development of socialist economy and capitalist economy to analyze the development and changes of these economic forms. However, what we want to consider here is not this, but the method of studying these issues, or how to use universal laws to study specific social formations. Many people have read Lenin's "The Development of Capitalism in Russia". I think this book is the best example of using universal Marxist truth to analyze specific social formations. In this book, Lenin did not just repeat the principles of Marxism, but used these principles to make a concrete analysis of the specific situation in Russian society. When reading it, we can deeply feel that everything is based on reality, not on abstract principles; it clarifies the inherent regularity of Russian social development, rather than merely proving whether universal laws are functioning in Russian society. Regarding this book, Lenin said a very instructive sentence: "I would rather bear the sin of tedious narration than let the reader think that my views are based on 'citations' from 'Capital', rather than on the study of Russian statistical materials." However, when I open the articles written by myself and some comrades, I feel that they are not entirely or not at all such research methods. Many articles are rarely based on the study of Chinese statistical materials, and often only use some examples to prove certain conclusions: For example, socialist economic laws have directly played a role in the socialist economy and have an impact on other economic components at the same time; the objective basis of agricultural cooperativization and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is the law that production relations must be suitable for the nature of productive forces, etc. In recent years, due to the prevalence of such articles, people have developed a misunderstanding, as if writing articles and making reports can only be considered theoretical analysis if the above conclusions are added. We have had discussions on the issue of the laws of economic development. These discussions have been fruitful, but some discussions, although seemingly heated, often fall into conceptual and logical inferences due to the lack of concrete analysis and research on the facts, and the arguments are often insufficient, and the results cannot be obtained for a long time.

There are many reasons for this phenomenon. I think the fundamental reason is that we have not learned to use Marxism, starting from reality, and the research method of detailed possession of materials. Therefore, when studying problems, we do not analyze the specific situation in China under the guidance of the general principles of Marxism-Leninism, but often are satisfied with adding these principles to the head of real economic life. In the past, Engels sharply criticized the attitude of German youth in the late nineteenth century when studying scientific issues. He said: "Generally speaking, for many young German writers, the adjective 'materialistic' is just a cliché. They use this cliché to deal with various things, and no longer spend any effort to do further research. That is to say, once they put this label on, they think everything is solved." Thinking carefully about this sentence is not without benefit to us.

Move away from the interpretation of ready-made formulas and towards the analysis of objective economic processes

In the process of studying the laws of economic development, there is also a tendency: instead of discovering the inherent regularity of the economic process through research, it is enthusiastic to find appropriate expression formulas for economic laws, as if as long as a certain economic process is roughly expressed, it is considered to have discovered objective laws.

I am not generally opposed to adopting the method of expressing formulas when explaining the laws of objective economic development. Sometimes it is necessary to do so in order to give readers a concise and easy-to-understand understanding. What I am opposed to is regarding this method as the most appropriate method, and wanting to use the expression formula to replace the research on the real economic process. Anyone who has read "Capital" knows that this book is a study of the laws of the emergence, development, and demise of the capitalist economy. However, in the entire book, Marx hardly tried to give a complete definition of the laws of the capitalist economy anywhere. Lafargue said it well: "We cannot find an isolated definition or an isolated formula in 'Capital'; what we see there is a series of precise analyses, showing the most fleeting shadows and the most fundamental and unclear distinctions." Really, if you have read "Capital", you will have this feeling: We seem to have been introduced into a building, and each economic category is a staircase to understand the essence of the capitalist economy. Climbing the stairs step by step to the roof, we suddenly see the light and can overlook the entire face of capitalist society, seeing that this complex and noisy society is moving in a direction that negates itself in such a regular manner. Does Marx's method of explanation hinder our understanding of the laws of capitalist economic development? Not at all. On the contrary, it is precisely because he used this method of explanation that people have such a thorough understanding of a social system. We often talk about establishing a system for the socialist part of political economy. I think that when (I hope the time will not be too long) we move away from the interpretation of ready-made formulas and towards the analysis of objective economic processes, we will make a big step forward in this regard.

Why is this question specifically raised?

If we pay attention to some of the papers and pamphlets currently published (including those written by myself), you will feel what this method of expressing formulas has brought us. Take some articles discussing socialist economic laws and books explaining modern capitalist economic laws as examples. They often use the same format to repeat and explain ready-made formulas, and routinely use many examples (these examples are also mostly selected based on formulas) to demonstrate the purpose of production and the means to achieve the purpose. This phenomenon shows that these formulas have somewhat hindered our thinking. Therefore, I think it is now time to correct such research methods. If this continues, our economic research and propaganda work will go into a dead end and be isolated from the sunlight and earth of real life.

Should people who study political economy study specific economic issues?

The last question is: Should people who study political economy study specific economic issues? People often say this: Political economy is the study of abstract theoretical issues, so it can only study economic laws. Although there are many specific economic issues, these issues cannot be studied too much, otherwise it will exceed the scope of political economy research.

Generally speaking, there is not much wrong with this statement. Political economy is indeed a basic theoretical science in economic science, focusing on the study of abstract theoretical issues. The task of this science ultimately is to reveal the laws of economic development. However, we cannot oppose this task to the study of specific economic problems. Because any theoretical abstraction needs to start from the specific, theoretical science cannot be separated from the study of specific economic problems, and must use the research results of specific economic problems to constantly enrich itself, otherwise it cannot develop and will become a castle in the air. In fact, our understanding of the laws of economic development must also go through the study of interconnected economic categories, and these economic categories will inevitably be linked to specific economic problems. For example, when studying the value of socialist commodities, you must understand a series of specific issues such as price, price ratio, price difference, state-owned brand price, market price cost, wages, profits, etc. These issues seem very specific, but without understanding these issues, you cannot understand the value of socialist commodities and the relationship between people that it embodies. If a person who studies economic science has no interest in these, and is only satisfied with the study of abstract theory, then the result can only be to repeat ready-made conclusions. Political economy and sectoral economics should have a division of labor. For example, political economy studies the universal laws of various economic systems, while sectoral economics studies the special regularity of the economic movement of each sector. However, the division of labor in any scientific field has only relative independence, especially in the research process, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish so clearly. As everyone knows, Marx paid close attention to the study of specific sectoral economic issues in the process of writing "Critique of Political Economy" and "Capital". He studied works on currency, banking, commerce, the conditions of workers and peasants in various countries, population issues, land issues, colonial history, etc., studied statistics, and even studied Italian-style bookkeeping. Without such vast knowledge of specific economic processes, Marx could not have revealed the laws of social and economic development so profoundly.

I feel that many of us who study economics have a prominent shortcoming, that is, we lack a lot of knowledge of specific economic sectors. We enjoy discussing abstract issues, but when we come into contact with real economic issues, we often understand them very superficially. This situation has hindered our understanding of the laws of social and economic development. Therefore, I advocate that the study of political economy, especially the socialist part, should still start from specific economic problems. What I mean by starting from specific economic problems is not to limit political economy to the study of specific economic problems, but to use it as a threshold, from the specific to the abstract, to reveal the economic relationships embodied in each economic category, and gradually achieve an understanding of the regularity of objective economic processes.

    对于研究经济发展规律的一些意见
    苏星
    政治经济学的任务，是要透过复杂的社会现象，揭明客观经济过程所固有的规律性，对于这个问题，在原则上，大家是没有异议的。但是，在我们具体实践过程中，从最近几年已经发表的论述关于经济发展规律的文章来看，好像有些问题还没有完全解决。这些问题包括：第一、社会主义经济关系的实质和社会主义经济发展的规律是不是已经彻底揭明了；第二、怎样运用已经从经济科学上揭明了的某一社会形态的经济发展规律，来分析相同的经济形态；第三、怎样看待用公式来表述经济发展规律；第四、为了认识客观经济过程的规律性，是不是需要研究具体的经济问题。这些问题都很大，牵涉到政治经济学的研究对象和研究方法，一下子很难说得清楚。本文只能把它们提出来，说明一些自己的看法，供大家讨论。
    对社会主义经济发展的规律用不着再作科学研究吗？
    对于社会主义经济的研究，人们有这样一种看法：由于社会主义经济关系是以生产资料公有制为基础的，这种关系的实质是一目了然的，似乎政治经济学用不着再去做科学研究来揭明它。另外还有人认为，社会主义经济发展的规律已经认识了，科学的任务不是继续发现和认识客观经济过程的规律性，而是研究这些规律的作用形态或者研究怎样自觉地利用它们。
    我不同意这些看法。
    的确，社会主义的经济关系比起资本主义经济关系是单纯得多了，因为社会主义社会是由单一的经济关系构成的；而且社会主义经济关系既不像封建社会那样被主从关系所淹没，也不像资本主义社会那样被买卖关系所遮盖，仅就这种情形来看，社会主义的经济关系可以认为是一目了然的。不过，这并不是社会主义经济关系的全貌。社会主义的经济关系包括整个生产、分配、交换和消费过程的关系，这些关系是相当复杂的，特别是由于社会主义经济中还存在着商品生产，人和人之间的关系在一定范围内还必须通过商品交换来表现，以致人们不得不经过对于商品、货币这些经济范畴的研究，来认识它们所体现的关系。所以，全部揭明社会主义经济关系，还需要经过艰巨的科学研究工作。
    对生产关系的研究是这样，对经济发展规律的研究也是这样，当生产关系的实质还没有全面揭明的时候，自然谈不到经济发展规律已经完全认识。毫无疑问，马克思列宁主义的经典作家们为我们奠定了研究社会主义经济的理论基石，而且揭明了社会主义经济发展规律的许多重要方面，这些都是极其宝贵的遗产，但是，我们今天还不能说，社会主义经济发展规律已经揭示无遗了。在实际经济生活当中，社会主义经济的许多现象，我们现在还不能作出科学的解释；我们的某些重大经济政策和经济措施所引起的后果，有时和事先预料的相反，这些就证明我们对于社会主义经济发展的规律性还认识得不深不透。至于摆在眼前的社会主义经济当中的许多重大理论问题，我们不过刚刚开始研究。为什么到现在为止社会主义经济发展规律没有完全揭明呢？我认为主要是由于以下这些原因所致：第一、社会主义经济本身的发展还没有最后成熟。一般地说，社会主义经济发展的历史还是不长的，苏联是四十年，欧洲人民民主国家不过十多年，我们只有七年。社会主义是一个完全崭新的社会制度，在建设过程中不能没有一个摸索经验的过程，以致许多事情要重新做起。列宁曾经说过：“在共产主义没有彻底实现以前，任何一种形式都不是最后的形式。”这种情况，不可避免地会限制我们观察问题的深度和广度，限制我们对于客观经济规律的认识。第二、对社会主义经济的研究还不够充分。资产阶级经济学者从重商主义开始，对于资本主义经济的研究，大约经过两个半世纪，马克思批判地接受了这些遗产，付出了四十年的劳动，才系统地揭明了资本主义发生、发展和灭亡的规律。可是对社会主义经济的研究，从马克思、恩格斯算起，也不过是一百多年的时间，那个时候还没有社会主义经济，顶多只能对社会主义经济在原则上作一些科学的推测。真正有条件对社会主义经济进行研究是在伟大的十月社会主义革命以后，在这方面，列宁和斯大林所留给我们的科学遗产是相当丰富的。至于经济科学工作者对于社会主义经济的研究，到现在为止，虽然积累了一些资料，取得了一些成就，但是并不很大。我们所要研究的是一个整个的社会制度，需要较多的时间，不可能是一蹴即成的。
    因此，不能认为社会主义经济发展规律已经完全揭明了，这样会束缚我们自己的手脚。对于社会主义经济过程规律性的研究，我们还必须准备付出较长时间的艰巨的劳动。
    应对我国实际情况进行研究呢？还是只用若干事例来证明某些结论呢？
    最近几年，我国的经济科学工作者，对于经济发展规律的研究，有着浓厚的兴趣，在这方面发表了不少文章。一直到现在，翻开许多高等学校和研究机关的科学研究计划，还广泛地流行着这样的题目：某一社会主义经济规律或者价值规律在我国过渡时期的作用；社会主义经济规律在某个具体经济部门的作用；农业合作化和对资本主义工商业社会主义改造的客观依据；某项政策和计划的科学基础等等。这些文章和研究题目有一个共同之点，都是用在科学上已经阐明了的某一社会形态的经济规律，来分析同样的经济形态。
    暂且不来细致地推敲这些题目本身的提法，从一般的道理出发，政治经济学做这样的研究应当是允许的，因为对于一定的生产方式适用的规律，同样也适用于具有同样生产方式的所有历史时期。我国过渡时期既有社会主义经济和资本主义经济，当然可以用已经阐明了的社会主义经济和资本主义经济的发展规律来分析这些经济形态的发展和变化。不过，在这里我们所要考虑的不是这些，而是研究这些问题的方法，或者说怎样用普遍规律来研究具体的社会形态。许多人都读过列宁的“俄国资本主义的发展”一书，我认为这本书是运用马克思主义普遍真理，分析具体的社会形态最好的典型。在这本书里，列宁并不是只重复马克思主义的原理，而是运用这些原理对俄国社会的具体情况作了具体分析，读起来，我们可以深切地感觉到：这一切都是从实际出发的，而不是从抽象原则出发的；它阐明了俄国社会发展所固有的规律性，而不是仅仅证明普遍规律是不是在俄国社会发生作用。对于这本书，列宁讲过一句很有教益的话，他说：“宁肯负叙述枯燥的罪名，而不愿使读者认为我的观点是根据从‘资本论’所作的‘引证’，而不是根据对俄国统计材料的研究。”然而，翻开我自己和有些同志写的文章，却感觉到并不完全是或者完全不是这样的研究方法，有许多文章很少是根据中国统计材料的研究，往往只是用若干事例来证明某些结论：例如社会主义经济规律在社会主义经济中已经直接发生作用，同时对其他经济成分发生影响；农业合作化和资本主义工商业社会主义改造的客观依据是生产关系一定适合于生产力性质的规律等等。近几年由于这一类文章的泛滥，竟使人们发生了一种误解，好像写文章、做报告只有加上上述结论，才算作了理论分析。在经济发展规律的问题上我们展开过讨论，这些讨论是有收获的，但是有些讨论看起来虽然热烈，却由于对事实缺乏具体的分析和研究，论据不足，也使得争论常常陷入概念和逻辑的推论，长期得不到结果。
    产生这种现象的原因很多，我想根本原因还在于我们没有学会运用马克思主义，从实际出发，详细占有材料的研究方法，所以，研究问题不是在马克思列宁主义一般原理指导下，对中国的具体情况作具体分析，而往往是满足于把这些原理加在现实经济生活的头上。从前，恩格斯尖锐地指责过十九世纪末叶德国青年研究科学问题的态度，他说：“一般说来，对于德国许多青年作家，‘唯物主义的’这个形容词不过是一个套语，他们用这个套语去处理各种事物，再也不花什么气力去作进一步研究，也就是说，他们一把这个标签贴上去，就以为一切都解决了。”仔细思索一下这句话，对我们并不是没有好处的。
    离开对现成公式的解释，转到对客观经济过程的分析
    在研究经济发展规律的过程中，还有这样一种倾向：不是通过经济过程的研究发现它所固有的规律性，而是热心地给经济规律寻觅恰当的表述公式，好像只要把某一经济过程大致表述一番，就算发现了客观规律。
    我不是一般的反对在说明客观经济发展规律的时候，采用表述公式的方法，有时为了给读者以简明通俗的了解，是需要这样做的。我所反对的是把这种方法看成最合适的方法，想用表述公式来代替对于现实经济过程的研究。读过“资本论”的人就知道，这本书是研究资本主义经济发生、发展和灭亡的规律的，但是，在全书中马克思几乎没有在任何地方想为资本主义经济规律下过什么完整的定义。拉伐格说的很好：“我们在‘资本论’中找不出一个孤立的定义，也找不出一个孤立的公式；我们在那儿所见的是一连串的精密的分析，把那最易逝的阴影和最根本而又最不明晰的分别显示出来。”真的，假如你读过“资本论”，你就会有这样的感觉：我们仿佛被引进了一座大厦，每个经济范畴都是认识资本主义经济实质的一个楼梯，沿着楼梯一级一级地登上屋顶，于是豁然开朗，可以俯瞰整个资本主义社会的面貌，看到这个庞杂喧嚣的社会，原来是那样有规律地向着一个否定自己的方向运动着。马克思这样的说明方法是不是妨碍了我们对于资本主义经济发展规律的认识呢？丝毫都没有。相反的，正是由于他运用的是这种说明方法，才使得人们把一个社会制度了解的这样透彻。我们常常谈论建立政治经济学社会主义部分的体系，我认为什么时候（但愿时间不要太长）离开对现成公式的解释，转到对客观经济过程的分析，在这方面就会前进一大步。
    为什么要特别提出这样的问题呢？
    如果我们留心一下目前出版的某些论文和小册子（包括我自己写的），你就会感觉到这种表述公式的方法，给我们带来了什么。试看有些论述社会主义经济规律的文章和说明现代资本主义经济规律的书，往往是用相同的格式重复和解释现成的公式，照例是用许多事例（这些事例也多是根据公式挑选的）来论证生产目的和达到目的的手段。这种现象表明这些公式已经多少地妨害了我们头脑的思考。所以我认为现在应当是改正这样的研究方法的时候了，长此下去，我们经济学的研究工作和宣传工作就会走进一条死胡同，和现实生活的阳光大地隔离起来。
    研究政治经济学的人要不要研究具体的经济问题？
    最后一个问题是：研究政治经济学的人，要不要研究具体的经济问题？人们常常这样说：政治经济学是研究抽象理论问题的，因此只能研究经济规律。具体的经济问题虽然很多，但是不能过多的研究这些问题，否则，就会超出政治经济学的研究范围。
    一般地说，这种提法没有多大毛病。政治经济学在经济科学当中，确实是一门基础理论科学，偏重于抽象理论问题的研究，这门科学的任务归根结底是为了揭明经济发展规律。不过，我们不能把这个任务和具体经济问题的研究对立起来。因为任何理论上的抽象都需要从具体出发，所以理论科学也不可能离开具体经济问题的研究，并且必需用具体经济问题的研究成果来不断地丰富自己，否则，它就不能发展，就会成为空中楼阁。事实上，我们对于经济发展规律的认识，也要经过对互相联系的经济范畴的研究，而这些经济范畴必然会和具体经济问题联系在一起，例如研究社会主义商品的价值，你就要了解价格、比价、差价、国营牌价、市价成本、工资、利润……等等一系列的具体问题，这些问题看起来很具体，但是，不了解这些问题，就不能了解社会主义商品的价值以及它所体现的人和人之间的关系。如果一个研究经济科学的人，对这些一概无兴趣，只是满足于抽象理论的研究，那末，结果也只好去重复现成的结论。政治经济学和部门经济学是应当有分工的，例如政治经济学研究各种经济制度的普遍规律，部门经济学则研究各个部门经济运动的特殊规律性。不过，任何科学领域的分工都只有相对的独立性，特别是在研究过程中，有时候很难分得那么清楚。大家知道，马克思在写作“政治经济学批判”和“资本论”的过程中，一直很注意具体部门经济问题的研究，他研究过货币、银行、商业、各国工农状况、人口问题、土地问题、殖民历史等各方面的著作，研究过统计学，甚至还研究过意大利式的簿记。如果没有这样浩繁地对于具体经济过程的知识，马克思就不可能那样深刻地揭明社会经济的发展规律。
    我感到我们许多研究经济学的人，有一个突出的缺点，就是对于具体经济部门的知识十分缺乏。讨论抽象问题津津有味，一接触到现实经济问题，往往理解的很浮浅，这种状况已经妨害了我们对社会经济发展规律的认识。所以，我主张研究政治经济学，特别是社会主义部分，还是应当从具体经济问题出发。我所说的从具体经济问题出发，不是说把政治经济学局限于研究具体经济问题，而是把它作为门阶，从具体到抽象，揭明每个经济范畴所体现的经济关系，逐步地达到对于客观经济过程的规律性的认识。
