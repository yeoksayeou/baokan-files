    New Record for Duck Egg Production
    Do you know how many duck eggs a duck can lay in a year?
    Under normal natural climatic conditions, the egg-laying period during the spring and autumn rainy seasons is about 180 days. This means that with excellent breeding techniques, a duck can lay a maximum of 180 duck eggs per year, and 100 ducks can lay a maximum of 18,000 duck eggs per year. Of course, this was impossible in the past. According to many veteran duck farmers, "100 ducks laying 10,000 eggs" was just a beautiful wish of the duck farmers, let alone 100 ducks laying 18,000 eggs a year.
    However, in Mianyang County, a famous duck egg producing area in Hubei Province, the Guanghua Duck Cooperative created a "miracle" last year: 7,450 female ducks laid a total of more than 1.4 million eggs, averaging "20,000 eggs per 100 ducks." Wang You'er, a member of the cooperative, raised 750 ducks, and the average yield per 100 ducks reached 22,350 eggs.
    The very famous, bright red-yolked, and glistening Salty Sand Lake Eggs are produced in this area. Among the more than 160,000 duck eggs laid by Wang You'er's ducks, 20% were double-yolk eggs, as large as a person's fist.
    The experience of "20,000 eggs per 100 ducks" created by the Guanghua Duck Cooperative is being promoted at the Second Hubei Provincial Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference and has aroused great interest among many people.

    鸭子生蛋的新纪录
    你知道一只鸭子一年能产多少鸭蛋？
    按照一般的自然气候条件，在春秋雨季产蛋的时间大约是一百八十天左右，这就是说饲养技术十分到家的话，一只鸭子一年最高可以产一百八十枚鸭蛋，一百只鸭子一年最高可以产一万八千枚鸭蛋。当然这在过去是不可能办到的。从许多老养鸭子的老人口里知道：“百鸭万蛋”都只是鸭民们的美好想望而已，更不消说一百只鸭年产一万八千枚蛋了。
    可是，在湖北省著名的产鸭蛋地区——沔阳县，有一个光华鸭业社去年却创造了“奇迹”：七千四百五十只母鸭共产蛋一百四十多万枚，平均“百鸭两万蛋”。社员王佑二饲养的七百五十只鸭子，每百只平均产量达到了两万二千三百五十枚。
    非常驰名的、蛋黄鲜红、油亮的沙湖盐蛋，就是这个地区出产的。王佑二饲养的鸭子产的十六万多枚鸭蛋，其中20％是双黄蛋，像人的拳头那样大。
    光华鸭业社创造的“百鸭两万蛋”的经验，正在湖北省第二届农业劳动模范代表大会上推广，而且使很多人感到极大的兴趣。
