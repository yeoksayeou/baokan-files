He said that although the students are older, they study very seriously, rarely absenting themselves from class, and engaging in lively debates during group discussions. He deeply realized that: "The socialist transformation of bourgeois elements will not be successful if they do not consciously exert themselves to learn actively."

I have been engaged in industry and commerce for more than twenty years. Last year, I strived to participate in studies at the Socialist Academy. I would like to talk about my personal ideological situation over the past few years and the insights I have gained during my studies:

The essence of the bourgeoisie is definitely two-sided. Over the seven years since the founding of the People's Republic, under the education and cultivation of the Party and the government's policy of peaceful transition and the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming, industrialists and businessmen have continuously studied and practiced, gradually improving their understanding and awakening. The positive side has grown daily, and the negative side has been reduced daily, and all have made progress to varying degrees.

Chairman Mao's instructions at this Supreme State Council meeting on the issue of socialist transformation, especially his pointing out and quoting personal experiences regarding the study of the national bourgeoisie, show how much care and expectation there is! I was very moved and excited to hear such instructions!

I am sixty-four years old this year and lived in the old society for a long time. In 1930, dissatisfied with the reactionary rule's measures, I felt that politics was not my way out, so I engaged in industry and commerce. Due to the weakness of the bourgeoisie, I fundamentally did not come into contact with new theoretical works and had little contact with advanced people. In 1949, the Southwest was completely liberated, and I returned to New China in January 1950. At that time, my idea was that I am Chinese, China has been unified, and I should return to the motherland. Although I was very worried that communism would not allow capitalists at all, how should enterprises be handed over? How should I live? But as a law-abiding citizen, I should not be disallowed to exist.

The facts after returning to the country were completely contrary to my past imagination. Not only were all my related enterprises transformed through joint public-private ownership, but also all the responsible comrades in the original unit were properly arranged, enabling everyone to better exert their positive roles. For me personally, there was especially excessive care in life, and I was also given a certain position politically. I should only be grateful to the Party and the government. Only through learning, enriching myself, and improving myself can I better serve the people.

My ideological transformation process can prove that continuous learning and continuous transformation are very necessary. Only by understanding the development of objective things through learning can I keep up with the times in a timely manner; otherwise, I will inevitably fall behind.

In August 1950, the People's Bank of China convened a financial conference. At that time, my idea was that we must have joint public-private ownership and that the People's Bank should appoint public shareholders. At that time, it can be said that I did not understand that state capitalism is an economic form of the transition period. I only thought that once joint public-private ownership was established and there were public representatives, my enterprise would receive government support. Not only would the existing labor-capital problems be easily resolved, but I could also expand my bank and several enterprises related to me. That could expand its business and strive for profits. After learning, I gradually recognized the nature of joint public-private ownership and realized that this idea was completely wrong. After the Three-Anti and Five-Anti movements, with a more profound education, I correctly and clearly recognized the ugly side of the bourgeoisie. In 1953, after studying the General Line, I deeply realized that joint public-private ownership is a relationship of leadership and being led, not an independent kingdom, and should not blindly compete. Due to the gradual improvement of understanding, I consciously felt that the transformation of individuals and enterprises could no longer be delayed. The superiority of socialism lies in the leadership of the state-owned economy and the unified planning of the state, which can be brought into play. It does not allow the one-sided thinking of some people in the enterprises related to me at that time, who only strive for the advanced form of joint public-private ownership and are unwilling to process orders in the intermediate form. The idea of only valuing the form and not striving for the performance of the enterprise is also wrong. When the economic reorganization of the entire industry into joint public-private ownership was completed, I deeply realized that this could better cooperate with national planning, reduce the waste of manpower and materials, give play to the effect of state-owned leadership, and greatly improve productivity. This is beneficial to the long-term interests of the country and also beneficial to industrialists and businessmen. From the transformation of my personal ideological understanding, I deeply realized that ideological transformation is inseparable from theory and work practice. This also shows that we must learn in order to transform.

The problems of "fixed interest" and "removing the capitalist label" that exist in the industrial and commercial circles today are interrelated and contradictory. Taking fixed interest makes it inconvenient to remove the label. My view on this issue is that taking fixed interest is, in theory, an act of exploitation, which is a tail left by bourgeois elements. One must be determined to cut off the tail before one can say that the label has been removed. From a policy perspective, fixed interest is a redemption policy, and its implementation has a time process. If there is a need in one's life, one can take it; if there is no need, one can also not take it. If everyone does not take fixed interest, and the government takes care of the original intention, imperialism may also take the opportunity to spread rumors. As long as industrialists and businessmen are willing to transform themselves, work with peace of mind, and actively contribute to production and operation, whether to take it or not, and whether to remove the label or not, if the transformation is good, everyone will eventually become the working people of socialist society. What does it matter sooner or later? In fact, how to use the fixed interest is up to you to decide. If there is no need in life, one can invest it in socialist construction undertakings or buy government bonds as much as possible. I believe that as long as the national bourgeois elements accept socialist transformation and practice it diligently, it does not matter whether the label is removed sooner or later. If we consider the influence of the peaceful transformation of Chinese industry and commerce on the international community today and the role it can play in the future, there is no need to simply consider it from personal subjective wishes.

Finally, I would also like to talk about my studies at the Socialist Academy. When I was studying in a group at the academy, I once talked about how I had been engaged in the old military and political circles for more than twenty years and felt that politics was not a way out, so I turned to the industrial and commercial circles for another twenty years. It can be said that my experience is complex, and it can be said that my path was wrong. In the old society, I did not have the courage to run ahead of the times. Coming to the new society, I must strive to move forward so as not to fall behind. The academy's teaching system follows the "three self" principles, but every student feels that learning is their urgent need. Although all the students are older, they all study very seriously. There are very few absences from class, and group discussions are very fierce. When encountering a problem, one must clarify it. This shows that reading in old age is slightly different from the mood of young people. In old age, one feels that one's needs are urgent and dare not be unserious. The students still feel that the time is not enough and hope to extend the study period. In my youth, I could only say that I read for the sake of reading and could not have the same mood.

The above is based on my own learning and transformation process over the past few years. I deeply realize that the socialist transformation of bourgeois elements will not be successful if they do not consciously exert themselves to learn actively. Whether the transformation is good or not depends entirely on whether the learning is diligent or not. Therefore, I speak frankly, hoping to get further help from everyone. I want to continue to work hard to study with the spirit of "not knowing that old age is coming" in order to complete the entire task of breaking down bourgeois ideas and establishing socialist ideas.

### 六十四岁老人吴晋航　谈在社会主义学院学习的心得

    六十四岁老人吴晋航
　　谈在社会主义学院学习的心得
    他说，全体同学虽然年龄大了，但是学习很认真，上课很少缺席，小组讨论问题时争论很热烈。他深切体会到：“资产阶级分子的接受社会主义改造，若不自觉地发挥努力学习的积极性，是不成功的。”
    我从事工商业有二十多年，去年争取参加社会主义学院学习，我想就个人几年思想情况，在学习中得到的体会提出来谈一谈：
    资产阶级的本质，具有两面性，这是肯定的。建国七年来，工商业者在党和政府和平过渡的方针，和利用限制改造的政策教育培养下，不断学习，不断实践，逐渐提高了认识，启发了觉悟，积极的一面，日益增长，消极的一面，在日益削减，都得了程度不同的进步。
    毛主席在这次最高国务会议指示：社会主义改造问题，对于民族资产阶级的学习，特别指出并引用亲身的体验，这是何等的关怀，何等的期待。我听了这样的指示，十分的感动，也十分的兴奋！
    我今年六十四岁，在旧社会里生长的日子很长。1930年为不满反动统治的措施，感觉到政治上不是自己出路，才从事工商业。由于资产阶级的软弱性，根本上我就没有接触到新的理论著述，也少同先进人士往来。1949年西南完全解放了，1950年1月我才回到新中国。当时我的想法，自己是中国人，中国已经统一了，自己应该回到祖国，虽然很顾虑共产主义根本不容许有资本家，企业怎样交代？自身怎样过活？但做一个安分守法的老百姓，应不会不容许我存在的。
    回国以后的事实，完全与自己过去的想像相反，不但我的有关企业全部公私合营获得改造，就是原单位所有的负责同志，也全得到适当的安排，能更好的发挥每个人的积极作用；对于我个人，尤其是生活上有逾量的照顾，政治上也给我一定的地位。我对于党和政府只应感谢，只有通过学习，充实自己，提高自己，才能更好的为人民服务。
    我的思想转变过程，可以证明不断学习、不断改造，是非常必要的。只有从学习中认识了客观事物的发展，自己才能够及时赶上去，否则必然是要落后的。
    1950年8月，人民银行召开金融会议，当时我的想法一定要公私合营，要人民银行指派公股董事，那个时候可以说还不懂得国家资本主义是过渡时期的一种经济形态，只以为一旦公私合营，有了公股代表，自己的企业便将得到政府的支持，不但内部存在的劳资问题容易解决，同时还可以扩张自己银行和自己有关的若干企业，那可以扩大它的业务，争取利润，这种思想在经过学习，逐渐认识了公私合营的性质，才知道是完全错误的。经过三反五反运动更深刻的教育，才正确清楚地认识了资产阶级丑恶的一面。1953年学习了总路线，又才深切体会公私合营是领导和被领导的关系，不是独立王国，更不应盲目竞争。由于认识的逐步提高，才自觉地认为个人和企业改造不容再缓，社会主义的优越性，正是在国营经济的领导和国家的统一计划下，才能够发挥出来，是不容许像当时与我有关企业中一部分人的片面想法，只争取公私合营的高级形式，不愿意中级形式的加工定货，只重形式不争取企业成绩思想上也是错误的。等到全行业公私合营经济改组，自己更深切体会到这样可以更好的配合国家计划，减少人力物力的浪费，发挥国营领导的效果，大大地提高生产率，这才有利于国家的长远利益，同时对工商业者也是有利的。从我个人这些思想认识的转变，深切体会到思想改造，是与理论和工作实践分不开的，这也说明我们要改造一定要学习。
    工商界今天存在着“拿定息”和“摘帽子”的问题，是相互关连也是相互矛盾的。要拿定息就不便于摘掉帽子，我对于这个问题的看法，拿定息在理论上是剥削行为，是资产阶级分子还留着的一条尾巴，必须自己下决心割断尾巴，才可以说摘掉帽子。从政策上体会定息是赎买政策，贯彻执行是有一个时间过程的，自己在生活上确有需要，可以拿，无需要亦可以不拿。大家都不拿定息，转负政府照顾初心，帝国主义也可能借词造谣。只要工商业者安心改造，安心工作，积极在生产经营上贡献力量，拿与不拿，和帽子摘与不摘，改造得好，最后大家都要成为社会主义社会的劳动人民，迟早有何关系。其实拿了定息，如何使用？自己是有权决定的。生活上如无需要，尽可投资于社会主义建设事业，或是尽量购买公债。我认为民族资产阶级分子，只要接受社会主义改造，躬行实践，帽子早摘迟摘无关。如果联系中国工商业和平改造在国际间今天所发生的影响，与未来所能起的作用，就更不必单纯从个人的主观愿望来考虑了。
    最后，我还想谈我在社会主义学院的学习，我在学院小组学习的时候，曾经谈到我在旧军政界搞二十多年，认为政治不是出路，才转入工商界，又是二十年历史，可以说是经历复杂，可以说是路线错误。在旧社会里，自己既没有勇气跑到时代前面，到新社会来必须争取前进，才不落在后面。学院教学制度是遵照“三自”原则，但每一个同学都感觉到学习是自己迫切需要，全体同学年龄虽大，学习都非常认真，上课固很少有缺席，就是小组讨论争论甚烈，接触到问题一定要弄明确，说明晚年的读书与少年时代心情微有不同。晚年是感觉到自己需要迫切，不敢不认真。同学尚以为时间不够，希望延长学习期限。少年时代，只可以说为读书而读书，不能同一心情。
    以上是就我自己几年来学习改造的过程，深切体会到资产阶级分子的接受社会主义改造，若不自觉地发挥努力学习的积极性，是不成功的。改造得好不好，完全在于学习的勤不勤，所以坦率地说出来，希望进一步得到大家的帮助，我要以“不知老之将至”的精神，继续努力学习，以竟破除资产阶级思想，建立社会主义思想的全功。（附图片）
