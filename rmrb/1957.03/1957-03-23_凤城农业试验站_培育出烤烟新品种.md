　　Fengcheng Agricultural Experiment Station
　　Cultivates New Variety of Flue-Cured Tobacco
　　This newspaper reports: The Fengcheng Agricultural Experiment Station in Liaoning Province, after six years of experimental research, has cultivated more than one hundred new varieties of flue-cured tobacco. These varieties are created by using flue-cured tobacco, sun-cured tobacco, and aromatic tobacco as parent materials, and then selecting and breeding through hybridization. These new types of flue-cured tobacco have tall plants (over three meters), thick stems (2.8 to 3.2 centimeters), short internodes (5 to 5.5 centimeters), and many leaves (50 to 62), and are more resistant to disease, wind, drought, and waterlogging. Therefore, the yield is very high, averaging 500 to 870 jin per mu, which is about 98% to 260% higher than the "Golden Seed" currently promoted in the province. The key tobacco-producing Xingcheng County will completely replace its 8,000 mu of tobacco fields with the new hybrid varieties this year.

　  凤城农业试验站
　　培育出烤烟新品种
    本报讯　辽宁省凤城农业试验站，经过六年的试验研究，已经培育出百多个烤烟新品种。这些品种是用烤烟、晒烟和香料烟等材料做亲本，经过杂交选育而成的。这些新种烤烟植株高大（三公尺以上），茎干粗壮（二点八至三点二厘米），节距短（五至五点五厘米），叶片多（五十至六十二片），抗病、抗风、抗旱、抗涝性较强。因此，产量很高，平均每亩产五百至八百七十市斤，比现在省内推广的“黄金种”每亩提高98％—260％左右。重点产烟兴城县八千亩烟田，今年将全部改换新杂交品种。
