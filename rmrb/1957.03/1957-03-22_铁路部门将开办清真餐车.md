The Railway Department will open halal dining cars
    In order to solve the dietary problems of ethnic minorities who believe in Islam during their travels, the Passenger Bureau of the Ministry of Railways has made new regulations based on the customs, characteristics of various ethnic groups who believe in Islam, and the existing conditions of the railway department. According to this regulation: "Halal" dining cars will be opened in areas where ethnic minorities who believe in Islam live in concentrated communities and where there is a large flow of passengers, and where staff, supplies, and equipment can be resolved. In long-distance passenger train dining cars on major trunk lines across the country, "Halal" tableware will be added; "Halal" pastries will be provided, and meals suitable for Islamic passengers will be prepared.

　  铁路部门将开办清真餐车
    铁道部旅客局为了解决信仰伊斯兰教的少数民族在旅途中的饮食问题，特地根据信仰伊斯兰教各民族的风俗习惯、特点和铁路部门现有的条件作了新的规定。根据这个规定：凡在信仰伊斯兰教各民族聚居及其旅客流动量大的地区，工作人员、货源和设备都能解决的情况下，将开办“清真”餐车。在全国各主要干线上的长途旅客列车餐车，增设“清真”餐具；供应“清真”糕点，制做适合于伊斯兰教旅客食用的饭菜。
