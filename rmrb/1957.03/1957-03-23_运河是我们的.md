The Canal Is Ours
Mukhtar Muhammad An-Nadi

I, like a lost person, walk through the noisy crowd. I walk, as if a magician who has lost his spell… Yet in my heart, I am filled with such tenderness and passion – I want to tell everyone I meet how I feel. The intense glow of the city's lights overthrows the gloomy walls of the night, freeing the earth from darkness. The crowd surrounds me like a flood. The flustered voices of street vendors fill the silence of the night, and the crowd is waiting around the loudspeakers. We are all waiting beside the loudspeakers… Gamal's speech… What will he say?… Excitement races through the ranks, as if the waters of the Nile dispel all doubts. History awakens from its slumber, shattering the world of suffering and chains. Everyone is so happy, all doubts are swept away, when the Premier said: "The Canal, it is ours!" When he recovered the Canal for the people. We waited for the return of the Canal, we waited for a long ninety years. I want to cry, I want to smile. I want to smile because I have gained the wealth that was stolen from me. I want to smile because I have gotten rid of poverty, powerlessness, and terror. I want to cry, for the millions buried in the beloved basin and the barren desert, for those who wore shackles and handcuffs, who went and never returned. But joy has come back to us, and returned to our basin. Oh, the world of realized hope! We knew joy for the first time, when history wrote such a glorious chapter! That day laughter rang out for the first time. Misfortune and resentment disappeared. The people felt happiness for the first time—they had groaned under the trampling of the Turks, and had been robbed and oppressed by other foreigners. And they, like smoke, all floated away, wearing deceptive cloaks, while history is writing fiery words! Oh, how many sacrifices the people have suffered! Oh, how many people have fallen into the soil, so that all the hopes on our beloved basin can become reality! And today I proclaim loudly: The Canal, it is mine!… I am Egyptian!

　　运河是我们的
　　穆赫塔尔·穆罕麦德·安一纳迪我，好像是迷失的人，穿行在喧嚷的人群中，我走着，仿佛是位魔法师，失去了自己的符咒……然而在我的心里却充满那样的温柔和热情——对每个相逢的人我都想讲述自己的感觉。城市的灯火的强烈的光辉掀倒了夜晚的阴郁的墙壁，使大地解除了黑暗。人群包围着我，像洪水泛滥，街头小贩们的慌张的声音填满了夜晚的寂静，而人群环绕着扩音器，正在等候。我们全都在扩音器旁边等候……加麦尔的讲演……他要讲甚么呢？……激动的感情在行列中飞奔着，仿佛是尼罗河的水驱散了所有的疑虑。历史从睡梦中惊醒了，粉碎了苦难和锁链的世界。大家是这样欢乐，疑虑都一扫而空，当总理说道：“运河，它是我们的！”当他给人民收回了运河。我们等候着运河的回来，我们等候了悠长的九十年。我想要哭泣，我想要微笑。想微笑，因为我获得了从前被偷走了的财富。想微笑，因为已经摆脱了穷困、无权和恐怖。想哭泣，为了千百万埋葬在亲爱的盆地和不毛的沙漠中的人，为了那些带上了足镣手铐的人，去了就没有回来的人。但欢乐向我们走回来了，又回到我们的盆地来了。哦，实现了的希望的世界！我们第一次认识了欢乐，当历史写上这样辉煌的一章！那一天第一次响着笑声。不幸和怨恨消失了。人民第一次感到了幸福，——他们在土耳其人的蹂躏下呻吟过，又被其它的一些外国人抢劫和压迫过。而他们，像烟雾一样，全都飘过了，穿着骗人的外衣，而历史正在书写着火焰般的字句！哦，人民遭受了多少牺牲！哦，多少人倒进了泥土里，为了在我们亲爱的盆地上所有的希望能变成现实！而我今天大声地宣讲：运河，它是我的！……我是埃及人！
