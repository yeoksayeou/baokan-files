Inspired by the National Conference of Agricultural Labor Model Representatives
The "Friendship" Cooperative is Steadily Moving Forward

    Following the conclusion of the National Conference of Agricultural Labor Model Representatives, the Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ziyang County, Shandong Province, like millions of other agricultural cooperatives, presents a vibrant and bustling scene during the spring plowing season.

    Huang Yongfu, the director of the Friendship Cooperative, after attending the National Conference of Agricultural Labor Model Representatives, returned to the cooperative and carried out various publicity activities to convey the spirit of the conference to the masses. The cooperative members enthusiastically responded to the call of the conference and are trying every possible means to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest in 1957.

    Since its establishment in 1955, the Friendship Cooperative has achieved high millet yields of over 1,000 catties per mu for consecutive years. Now, the Friendship Cooperative is taking measures to increase production based on previous years, adapting to local conditions. In order to expand the irrigation area this year, many old wells have been deepened to tap into the springs at the bottom, and many new wells have been dug. Recently, more than 120 mu of pits and trenches have been filled in, which can yield more than 10,000 catties of hemp. The cooperative has also launched a manure accumulation campaign, planning to accumulate 80 million catties of manure this year, averaging two large cartloads of fertilizer per mu. In the manure accumulation campaign, they put forward the slogan: "Think big, start small, everyone participates, every household accumulates manure."

    The Friendship Cooperative also regards the development of pig raising as an important task. At present, the cooperative is trying to help members overcome the difficulties of repairing pigsties, and change the old habit of raising pigs in the wild in the past, so as to raise the pigs better and accumulate more fertilizer.

    Huang Yongfu said at a meeting of all party members, Youth League members, production team leaders, and activists in the cooperative: As long as all cooperative members and cadres use their brains, try every possible means, and work hard, our cooperative can achieve a greater harvest this year than in previous years.

He learned a lot of production knowledge at the exhibition and also introduced the experience of the Friendship Cooperative's consecutive years of high millet yields to the audience.

    [Image Caption]: Qiu Mingyu, an experienced farmer and technician, said at the experienced farmers' forum: "To strive for a greater harvest, we must combine our experience with advanced scientific methods..."

    [Image Caption]: Early spring harrowing has begun in the Friendship Cooperative.

    [Image Caption]: After returning to the cooperative, Director Huang Yongfu convened a meeting of the agricultural cooperative management committee, a meeting of party members, Youth League members, production team leaders, and activists, and an experienced farmers' forum to convey the spirit and resolutions of the Labor Model Representative Conference; and introduced the high-yield achievements and experiences of fraternal cooperatives. This is the experienced farmers' forum studying methods to increase production.

    [Image Caption]: "Apply more fertilizer in the spring, harvest more grain in the fall." The cooperative members all understand the close relationship between applying fertilizer in a timely manner and striving for a bumper harvest.

    [Image Caption]: Old Granny Qiu, a cooperative member who has raised more than a dozen pigs of various sizes year round, will no longer use the old method of raising pigs in the wild after the pigsty is repaired.

    [Image Caption]: In every production activity of the Friendship Cooperative, many primary school graduates can be seen working diligently. Look, they are at the forefront when transporting fertilizer.

    [Image Caption]: The women of the Friendship Cooperative never lag behind in production work, and they also have a lot of production experience. The seed selection experience that their director brought back from Beijing this time makes them feel even more refreshed.

    [Image Caption]: The Friendship Cooperative dug seven drainage ditches this spring, totaling more than 18,000 meters in length, which will save more than 6,000 mu of crops in waterlogged lowlands. The cooperative members are working really hard to dig the drainage ditches, working with their upper bodies bare.

    [Image Caption]: Among the Friendship Cooperative's more than 13,000 mu of land, the highlands that are threatened by drought year-round account for more than 6,000 mu. In order to strive for a greater harvest with certainty, they dug another 127 wells, which can irrigate more than 6,000 mu of land. This is one of the most outstanding well-digging teams in the Friendship Cooperative. From December last year to mid-March this year, they have dug more than 30 wells, and the quality of the wells is also among the best in the cooperative.

    [Image Caption]: Two manure accumulation experts are talking about this year's manure accumulation plan: Cao Yuwu (right), 77 years old, picked up more than a dozen large carts of manure last year, totaling more than 50,000 catties; Wu Xilun (left), 67 years old, in addition to participating in field labor and cutting more than 10,000 catties of grass last year, also picked up more than a dozen large carts of manure, totaling more than 30,000 catties.

    在全国农业劳模代表会议的鼓舞下
    “友谊”社在稳步前进
    全国农业劳动模范代表会议闭幕以后，山东省滋阳县友谊农业生产合作社在春耕季节里，同千万个农业社一样，呈现着一片热火朝天的景象。
    友谊社社长黄永福，在参加全国农业劳动模范代表会议以后，回到社里进行了各项宣传活动，把会议的精神传到群众中去。社员们热烈响应大会的号召，正想尽一切办法争取1957年农业大丰收。
    友谊社自1955年成立以来，连年谷子获得千斤丰产。现在友谊社正在往年的基础上因地制宜采取增产措施。为了扩大今年土地的浇水面积，将许多老井进行了井底下泉，还打了不少新井；最近，又填平了一百二十多亩的坑壕，可收麻一万余斤。社里还展开了积肥运动，计划今年全社积肥八千万斤，平均每亩能施肥两大车。在积肥运动中，他们提出的口号是：大处着想，小处着手，人人动手，户户积肥。
    友谊社把发展养猪事业也作为一项重要的工作。目前，社里正设法帮助社员克服修猪圈的困难，改变过去生猪在野外放养的老习惯，以便把猪养得更好和积更多的肥料。
    黄永福在全社党员、团员、生产队长和积极分子会上说：只要全体社员和社干部开动脑筋、想尽一切办法、下劲干，咱们这个社今年能够获得比往年更大的丰收。

    下图：友谊社社长黄永福在参加全国农业劳动模范代表会议期间，参观了全国农业展览会。他在展览会上学习到许多生产知识，同时也向观众介绍了友谊社谷子连年丰产的经验。
    老农技术员丘明玉在老农座谈会上说：“要争取更大的丰收，就得把咱们的经验和先进的科学方法结合起来……”
    早春耙地在友谊社开始了。
    社长黄永福回社以后，召开了农业社管理委员会，党团员、生产队长和积极分子会，老农座谈会，传达了劳动模范代表会议的精神和决议；并且介绍了兄弟社的丰产成绩和经验。这是老农座谈会正在研究增产办法。
    “春季多施肥，秋季多打粮。”社员们都懂得适时施肥和争取大丰收的密切关系。
    常年饲养着大小十几头猪的社员丘老大娘，等猪圈修好以后，就不再用野外放养生猪的老办法了。
    在友谊社的每一项生产活动里，都可以看到许多小学毕业生在勤勉地劳动着。看，他们在运送肥料的时候走在最前面。
    友谊社的妇女，在生产工作上从不落后，她们也有许多生产经验。她们的社长这一次从北京带回来的选种经验更使她们感到新鲜。
    友谊社今春挖了七条长达一万八千多公尺的排水沟，将可救活六千多亩水涝洼地的庄稼。社员们挖排水沟的劲儿真大，光着上身在干活。
    友谊社的一万三千多亩土地中，常年受到旱灾威胁的高地有六千多亩。为了有把握地争取更大的丰收，他们又打了一百二十七眼井，可浇地六千多亩。这是友谊社的一个最出色的打井队。他们从去年12月到今年3月中旬，已经打了三十多眼，井的质量也是社里数一数二的。
    正在谈论着今年积肥计划的两位积肥能手：七十七岁的曹玉武（右），去年拾了十多大车粪，合五万多斤；六十七岁的吴锡仑（左），去年除了参加地里的劳动和割草一万多斤外，还拾了十多大车粪，合三万多斤。
