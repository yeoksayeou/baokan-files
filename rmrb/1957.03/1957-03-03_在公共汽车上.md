    On the Bus
    Jiang Liu
    One Saturday evening, I took the No. 36 bus home from the suburbs. I was gazing at the myriad lights of Beijing through the frosted window when I suddenly heard a clear child's voice say, "Excuse me, comrade, please give this old grandma a seat." I turned my head and saw an old lady with silver hair, leaning on a cane, standing in front of me. I quickly stood up and offered the old lady my seat. Only then did I notice a twelve or thirteen-year-old Young Pioneer standing behind the old lady. Her two small braids were perked up behind her head, and her big, watery eyes were looking at me with gratitude. It turned out that this little girl was the one who asked me to give up my seat. I thought, they must be grandmother and granddaughter....

    After the old lady sat down, she took a package from the little girl's hand, took out two apples, and said to the little girl with a smile:
   "Here, child, have an apple!"
   "No, I don't want to eat it."
   "Oh! You're too polite, what's the harm in eating two apples..."
   "..." The little girl just smiled shyly.

    Listening to their conversation, I thought to myself, "It seems that this old and young pair are not grandmother and granddaughter, but what is their relationship?" I even looked at whether their faces were somewhat similar. At this time, the bus arrived at Balizhuang Station, and the passenger sitting next to the old lady got off the bus. The old lady happily tugged at the little girl and said, "Sit down quickly, there's an empty seat!" The little girl glanced at me, as if she wanted to say something. I was afraid that she would be embarrassed to sit down, so I turned around and moved back a few steps. The old lady kept urging her to sit down, but she walked up to me and said:
   "Comrade, there's an empty seat over there, please go sit down!"
   "I'm not going to sit," I said with a smile, "You sit, I'm almost there!" She seemed to see that I was deceiving her, flicked her two braids, and walked back to the old lady, but she didn't sit down, still standing next to the empty seat. At this time, only the little girl and I were standing in the bus. Soon, the bus arrived at Mashenmiao Station, and the seat behind the old lady became vacant. I took the opportunity to sit down. After the little girl saw me sit down, she smiled mischievously at me and sat down in the empty seat next to the old lady. The old lady moved inward and asked with concern, "Are you tired from standing? Sit a little closer." Then, the old lady kept asking the little girl how old she was and where she lived, but the little girl seemed to be preoccupied and just hummed in response. After a while, the ticket seller came over, and the little girl said again in a clear child's voice:
   "Comrade, this old grandma is going to Chongwenmen and needs to transfer in the middle. Please ask if anyone is going the same way? So they can take care of the old grandma..."
    The ticket seller looked at the old lady and said with embarrassment, "I'm afraid it won't be that coincidental!"
    The little girl stared fiercely at the ticket seller and said, "It doesn't matter, if no one is going the same way, I'll take the old grandma there. Please ask!"
    The ticket seller hesitated for a moment and asked loudly, "Hey! Comrades, is anyone going to Chongwenmen? If so, please help take care of this old lady, she's going to Chongwenmen..."
    Before the ticket seller finished speaking, a rough voice came from the back seat: "Yes, I'm going." The person who said this was about thirty years old and looked like a construction worker, because there were patches of white lime slurry on his hat and trouser legs. The ticket seller approached the worker and asked suspiciously, "Are you going to Chongwenmen?" "No, I'm going to Taijichang, but it doesn't matter, I can get off a stop later." At this moment, the bus was approaching Baiduizi Station, and the little girl raised her neck and gave the worker a grateful glance. Then, she stood up to get off the bus. The old lady held the little girl's hand and kept saying, "Child, thank you, thank you..." Before the bus had come to a complete stop, the little girl flicked her braids and jumped to the ground, waving to the old lady and saying, "Goodbye, old grandma, be careful walking at night!"

    在公共汽车上
    江流
    星期六晚上，我坐三十六路公共汽车从郊外回家。我正透过结着霜花的车窗，遥望万家灯火的北京城，忽听得一声清脆的童音说：“劳驾，同志，给这位老奶奶让个座。”我扭过头来一瞧，面前站着一位拄着棍子、满头银丝的老太太。我急忙站起来，让老太太坐下。这时我才看见老太太身后还站着一位十二、三岁的“红领巾”。她脑后撅撅着两条小辫儿，一双水汪汪的大眼睛，露着谢意，不住地打量着我。原来要我让座的就是这位小姑娘。我想，她们一定是祖母和孙女……。
    老太太坐下后，从小姑娘手里接过包袱、伸手拿出两个苹果，笑呵呵地冲小姑娘说：
   “来，孩子，吃苹果吧！”
   “不，我不吃”
   “唉！你这孩子真外道，吃两个苹果怕啥……”
   “……”小姑娘只靦覥地笑了笑。
    听了她们的谈话，我暗想：“看来这一老一小并非祖孙俩，然而，到底是什么关系呢？”我甚至打量着她们的面孔是否有些相像。这时候，车到了八里庄站，坐在老太太旁边的乘客下车了。老太太愉快地拽一下小姑娘说：“快坐下吧，有空座啦”小姑娘瞟了我一下，好像要说什么。我怕她不好意思坐，一转身往后挪了几步。老太太还一味地让她坐，她却走到我的面前说：
   “同志，那边有空座请去坐吧！”
   “我不坐啦”我笑着说：“你坐吧，我快到站喽！”她好像看出我在欺骗她，把两条小辫一甩，走回老太太身旁，但她没有坐，仍然傍着空座位站着。这时，车里只剩我和小姑娘站着。不久，车到马神庙站，老太太后边座位空了，我趁机坐进去。小姑娘瞅我坐下后，冲我顽皮地一笑，也坐到老太太旁边的空位上。老太太往里移了移，心疼地问：“站累啦？你往里点坐呀。”接着，老太太唠唠叨叨的问起小姑娘几岁啦，在哪住，可是，小姑娘好想啥心事，只是哼哈的应着。一忽儿，售票员过来了，小姑娘又用清脆的童音说：
   “同志，这位老奶奶去崇文门，中间要倒车，请你给问问，有没有同路的？好照顾老奶奶……”
    售票员瞧瞧老太太，为难地说：“怕不会这么巧吧！”
    小姑娘狠狠地盯了一下售票员说：“没关系，没人同路，我送老奶奶去，你给问问吧！”
    售票员犹豫了一下，大声问：“喂！同志们，有没有去崇文门的？如果有，请帮着照顾一下这位老太太，她去崇文门……”
    售票员话音未落，从后边座位上发出一声粗哑的声音：“有，我去。”说这话的人，有三十岁上下，看来是位建筑工人，因为帽子和裤管上还有一块块白色的石灰浆点。售票员走近这位工人面前，怀疑地问：“你去崇文门么？”“不，我去台基厂，不过没关系，我可晚下一站。”这当口，车快到白堆子站，小姑娘仰起脖子，向那位工人投去感激的一瞥，随后，站起来准备下车。老太太握着小姑娘的手，不停地说：“孩子，感谢你啦，感谢你啦……”车还未停稳，小姑娘便一甩小辫蹦到地上，冲老太太摆摆手说：“老奶奶再见，夜里走路要小心呵！”。
