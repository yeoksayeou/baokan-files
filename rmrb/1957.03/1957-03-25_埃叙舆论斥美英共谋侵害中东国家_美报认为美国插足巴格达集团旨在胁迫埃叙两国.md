Xinhua News Agency, March 24th. TASS, March 23rd: The Egyptian newspaper "Al-Gomhouria" commented on the Bermuda talks, saying that Western leaders call their attempts to establish imperialist rule in the Middle East sometimes "protecting freedom of navigation," sometimes "filling the vacuum," and sometimes "caring for the maintenance of universal peace." However, the people of Arab countries see the dangers that Western policies bring to them, and therefore, unite to defend their national interests.
    The newspaper pointed out that just as the participants in the Bermuda conference were arguing about how to plunder the national rights of the Arab people, the Arab people demonstrated full solidarity and understanding on the issue of how to protect their rights and sovereignty.
    Ahmed al-Assah, owner and editor-in-chief of the Syrian newspaper "Al-Raya," pointed out in the newspaper's editorial that British Prime Minister Macmillan tried at the Bermuda conference to reach an agreement with Eisenhower on even preserving part of Britain's power in the Middle East, in order to further plunder the natural wealth of Arab countries. Al-Assah said: "Therefore, new imperialist conspiracies are threatening our countries, and the collective struggle of the Arab people is the only way to resist such conspiracies. Any idea of reconciliation with imperialism means a new opportunity for imperialists to enslave us."
    Xinhua News Agency, March 24th. New York dispatch: "New York Herald Tribune" said today that the United States' decision to participate in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee is to let Egypt and Syria know that they are in a "dangerous state of isolation from the Middle East."
    Some other American newspapers believe that this decision by the United States makes it possible to pre-plan military plans for the region.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 24th. New York dispatch: "The Wall Street Journal" published an article on the 20th, believing that "although the Bermuda talks will probably enable Washington and London to achieve closer cooperation, this by no means means restoring the close relationship of the World War II alliance. Britain is still the main ally of the United States, but it no longer has the power of the war years."
    The article pointed out that in addition to the impossibility of reaching an agreement on some fundamental issues in the Middle East, there are also differences between the United States and Britain on issues such as trade with China, Britain's withdrawal of troops from Europe, and the United States' supply of missiles to Britain.

    埃叙舆论斥美英共谋侵害中东国家
　　美报认为美国插足巴格达集团旨在胁迫埃叙两国
    据新华社24日讯　塔斯社23日讯：埃及“共和国报”在评论百慕大会谈时说，西方国家的领袖把他们在中东建立帝国主义统治的企图，时而叫做“保护通航自由”，时而叫做“填补真空”，时而又是“关怀维护普遍和平”，但是，阿拉伯各国人民看见了西方政策给他们带来的危险，因而，团结起来以保卫自己的民族利益。
    这家报纸指出，正当百慕大会议的参加者在争论掠夺阿拉伯人民族权利的方法的时候，阿拉伯人民在怎样保护自己的权利和主权的问题上，表现了充分的团结和谅解。
    叙利亚“旗帜报”的所有人和总编辑艾哈迈德·阿萨赫在这家报纸的社论中指出，英国首相麦克米伦在百慕大会议上力图同艾森豪威尔就那怕是保存英国在中东的部分势力的问题达成协议，以进一步掠夺阿拉伯国家的自然财富。阿萨赫说：“因此，又有新的帝国主义阴谋在威胁着我们这些国家，阿拉伯各国人民集体的斗争是抵抗这种阴谋的唯一办法。任何同帝国主义和解的思想都意味着将要给帝国主义者奴役我们的新机会。”
    据新华社24日讯　纽约消息：“纽约先驱论坛报”今天说，美国决定参加巴格达条约军事委员会，是为了让埃及和叙利亚知道，它们正处在“同中东隔绝的危险状态”。
    还有一些美国报纸认为，美国这一决定使预先拟定这个地区的军事计划成为可能。
    据新华社24日讯　纽约消息：“华尔街日报”20日刊载了一篇文章，认为“虽然百慕大会谈大概会使华盛顿和伦敦取得较密切的合作，但是这绝不意味着恢复第二次世界大战联盟那种密切的关系。英国仍然是美国的主要盟国，但是它不再拥有大战年代的权力了。”
    文章指出，除了不可能就中东一些根本性问题达成协议外，在对华贸易、英国从欧洲撤军以及美国向英国供应导弹等等问题上，美英两国也是存在分歧的。
