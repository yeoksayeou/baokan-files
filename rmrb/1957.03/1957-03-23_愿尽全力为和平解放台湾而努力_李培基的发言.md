    Willing to Exert All Efforts for the Peaceful Liberation of Taiwan
    Li Peiji's Speech
    After listening to the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and the work report of Vice Chairman Chen Shutong at this meeting, I wholeheartedly support and completely agree with them. I felt especially honored to hear Chairman Mao's instructions while attending the Supreme State Council meeting as a non-voting delegate. As a former military and political personnel, and because this is my first time participating in the meeting, I have not participated in inspection work. I have not personally studied the constructive opinions put forward by the members in various aspects, so I cannot raise any specific questions. I would like to take this opportunity at the conference to propose several tasks that I personally want to do in the future, and ask for your guidance.
    1. Devote all my strength to striving for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan: As we gather here joyfully and in great numbers for this meeting, let us not forget our relatives, friends, and former colleagues stranded in Taiwan, who are living a life of enslavement and suffering. If Taiwan is not liberated for a single day, they will not be free for a single day. We should help them return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible and enjoy the warmth of the motherland like us. Are they willing to be stray dogs rather than citizens of a strong country? Absolutely not. The problem lies only in the fact that they do not yet fully understand the motherland's concern for them. Therefore, it is necessary for us to devote all our strength, strengthen contact with them, and strengthen the work of peacefully liberating Taiwan. In the spirit of patriotism and unity, promoting peaceful negotiations is absolutely necessary.
    2. Actively participate in inspection work: Understand the development of the motherland in all aspects, and in accordance with the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," reflect what I have seen and heard to the conference in a supplementary manner. At the same time, I will try to report the new face of the motherland and the achievements of construction to friendly parties in Taiwan, so that they can recognize that only the strength of the motherland can improve its international status and obtain political freedom.
    3. Strengthen learning and transform thinking: Lenin said: Study, study, and study again. The ancients said: Learning has no end. I will definitely strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism in the spirit of living and learning until I am old. It is clear that only by studying historical materialism can we correctly criticize idealism. I am determined and confident to enter socialist society with the revolutionary ranks. I personally participated in the previous stage of our country's revolution from the Xinhai Revolution to the New Democratic Revolution, and I personally witnessed the latter stage of the socialist revolution. Only after decades have I found the road to revolution, tasted the fruits of revolution, and achieved the aspirations that I had imagined but failed to realize for decades. This is the most pleasant and exciting thing in my life. However, many old ideas still remain, and we must work hard to learn and thoroughly transform them in order to move towards socialism with the revolutionary ranks.
    Finally, I would like to especially point out that in recent years, encouraged by the country's vigorous development and rapid construction, I feel younger and more energetic. I am willing to contribute all my strength with the posture of a young man, an enterprising spirit, and a sincere attitude to fight for socialist construction to the end!

### 愿尽全力为和平解放台湾而努力  李培基的发言

    愿尽全力为和平解放台湾而努力
    李培基的发言
    在这次会议上听到了周总理、李富春副总理的报告及陈叔通副主席的工作报告，我衷心拥护和完全同意。列席最高国务会议时，亲聆毛主席的指示，尤其使我感到荣幸。我是一个旧军政人员，因为初次参加会议，还没有参加过视察工作，向各位委员所提各方面的建设性意见，我没有经过亲身研究，提不出什么问题来，谨在这次大会上提出我个人今后要做的几项工作，请大家指正。
  一、付出全部力量，为和平解放台湾而努力：我们在这里欢欣鼓舞、济济一堂地开会，不要忘记了流落在台湾的亲友和旧日同僚，他们正在那里受着奴役苦难的生活，台湾一日不解放，他们就一日得不到自由，我们应当帮助他们赶快回到祖国的怀抱里来，跟我们同样地享受祖国的温暖。他们甘愿做丧家之犬，而不愿做强国之民吗？绝不会的。问题只在于他们还没有完全了解祖国对他们的关怀，所以需要我们付出全部力量，加强和他们联系，加强和平解放台湾的工作，本着爱国一家的精神，促使和平谈判是完全必要的。
    二、积极参加视察工作：了解祖国各方面的发展情况并本着“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，把自己见到的、听到的拾遗补阙地反映给大会。同时也要把祖国新兴的面貌，建设的成就，设法向台湾友好报道，使他们认清只有祖国的强大，才能提高国际地位，才能得到政治上的自由。
    三、加强学习，改造思想：列宁说：学习、学习、再学习，古人说：学无止境，我一定本着活到老、学到老的精神，加强学习马列主义。很明显，学习了历史唯物主义，才能对唯心主义进行正确的批判。我有决心、有信心随着革命队伍走进社会主义社会，我国从辛亥革命到新民主主义革命到社会主义革命，前个阶段是我亲自参加的，后个阶段是我亲眼看到的，几十年来才找到了革命的道路，才尝到了革命的果实，达到了几十年来想像而没能实现的愿望，这是我一生中最愉快最兴奋的事。但是旧的思想还残存着不少，必须努力学习，彻底改造，才能随着革命队伍向社会主义迈进。
    最后，我想特别提出：几年来因为受到国家蒸蒸日上和建设飞速发展的鼓舞，我感觉着年轻了，精神也健旺了，我愿意以青年的姿态，奋发的精神，诚恳的态度，把全副力量贡献出来，为社会主义建设奋斗到底！
