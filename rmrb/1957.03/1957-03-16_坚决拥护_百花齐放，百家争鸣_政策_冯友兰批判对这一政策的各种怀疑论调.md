    Resolutely Support the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" Policy
    Feng Youlan Criticizes Various Skeptical Arguments Against This Policy
    I support Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference, as well as the reports and speeches of Premier Zhou and other leading comrades. As an educator and scientific worker, I particularly express my support and gratitude for the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy.

    It's Natural That Great Works Are Difficult to Produce in a Short Time
    Currently, some people express doubt about this policy. They say: The policy has been put forward, but why haven't we seen any great works or writings appear until now? Therefore, they doubt whether this policy can produce the expected results.

    I believe this doubt is unfounded. The "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Weed Through the Old to Bring Forth the New" policy was proposed relatively early. The "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy has been proposed for less than a year, a very short period. How can there be great works in a short period? Even copying would probably be too late. This requirement is too high.

    To Prevent or Correct Deviations,
    The "Contention" Method Should Also Be Used
    There are also some people who fear that deviations will occur in the implementation of this policy. Some believe that deviations have already occurred, and they demand that deviations be corrected and prevented. Correcting deviations and preventing deviations are necessary, but the preventive measures should not contradict the spirit of the policy. Correcting deviations should not be "throwing out the baby with the bathwater." To correct or prevent deviations from "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," it is best to use the "contention" method, that is: discuss and research, criticize and persuade, and prove that the deviation is a deviation. If other methods are used, then it is not correcting or preventing deviations from "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," but rather canceling "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend."

    "Contention" Has Already Begun
    Another group of people doubts whether anyone has started "contending" since the "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy was put forward.颜习斋 Yan Xizhai, a philosopher of the Qing Dynasty, said: If the teacher says, "Go east," some students stand up and go east, while others praise "Go east" but sit still. Of course, the former are good students, and the latter cannot be considered good students. This example is not entirely appropriate here, but it can be used as a metaphor. The leadership's proposal of the "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy is like sending a signal to "Go east." Are there already many people standing up and "going east," or are everyone still sitting still, only verbally supporting "going east"? As far as I know, many people have already started "going east." Although they have not yet become "schools," they have already begun to "contend."

    I am engaged in the work of Chinese philosophical history. In recent years, we have encountered many difficulties and problems in our work. Since the slogan "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" was put forward, we have openly presented these problems in the People's Daily. Some of our comrades have also put forward preliminary solutions to some of the more critical issues. On this basis, the Department of Philosophy of Peking University convened a forum in January, with enthusiastic participation and lively discussions. The speeches at the meeting were later written into articles and published successively in the People's Daily, Guangming Daily, and other publications, and have not yet been fully published. In the future, they will also be compiled into a special collection of more than 400,000 words.

    This forum focused on discussing methodological issues related to the history of philosophy, and later the discussion focused on two issues: one is the object of the history of philosophy (mainly the evaluation of idealism), and the other is the issue of the inheritance of philosophical heritage. These issues are very important and complex and cannot be completely resolved in a short period of time, but after discussion, the participants gained some preliminary common understandings. Due to time constraints, I cannot report these common understandings to the conference, but I can say with certainty that on the basis of these common understandings, our work on the history of Chinese philosophy will be improved a step further.

    The Soviet Union Is Actually Also "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend"
    Another group of people doubts why the Soviet Union has not put forward the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend." This doubt is also unnecessary. In the academic circles of the Soviet Union, in one subject, there are different schools of thought that have different views on certain issues in that subject. In a university, more than one teaching and research office can be established for a subject because there are different schools of thought. Even in philosophy, the Department of Philosophy of Moscow University and the Department of Philosophy of Leningrad University have become two schools of thought. These situations are exactly what the Soviet academic circles encourage. Schools of thought are different from sects. Sects are small circles organized by a few people for personal gain. Schools of thought are factions formed due to different academic propositions. Sects should not exist, but schools of thought should exist, and will inevitably exist in the context of academic development.

    The latest issue of the Soviet journal "Problems of Philosophy" (No. 6, 1956) published a report on a discussion at the "All-Soviet Philosophers Liaison Conference" (the translation is published in "Study Translations" No. 2, 1957). We are very interested in this report. Because their meeting also focused on discussing the methodology of the history of philosophy. The discussion also focused on the object of the history of philosophy and the issue of inheritance in the development of philosophical thought. There was a debate between two schools of thought on the object of the history of philosophy. The focus of the debate was basically the same as the debate in our forum.

    We have reason to believe that although the Soviet Union has not put forward the slogan "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," it is actually "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend."

    From the above, all the doubts about the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" are unnecessary.

    "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is also unfolding in other aspects of academic circles. In genetics, the Morgan school and the Michurin school are already contending very well. I believe that in the near future, different schools of thought will "contend" in various disciplines.

    Of course, "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" does not mean "a hundred schools" "peacefully coexist." Different views on the same issue may all be incorrect, but they cannot all be correct. There must be disputes between them. As a result of the dispute, the essence is taken from all kinds of views (of course, some views may have no essence), and the dross is discarded. Thus, these essences become part of the truth. The meaning of what President Guo Moruo said at the Supreme State Conference, "A hundred rivers flow differently, but all flow into the sea," is probably this.

    After all, those that can "flow into the sea" are "rivers." That is to say, there must be a partially correct view in order to contribute to the truth. If the view is completely wrong, then it is a "disconnected port and river" and will eventually disappear on its own. However, different views on a certain issue, especially issues involving a wide range and complex content, are not immediately knowable as to which are correct and which are wrong. Only through the process of discussion and debate, mutual criticism, can the correct gradually be recognized and the wrong gradually be abandoned. This is a reciprocating and tortuous process, that is, the dialectical process. Even the correct thing must go through this process for its development to be sound and its content to be rich.

    The Policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend"
    Guarantees the Normal Development of Academia in Our Country
    In this process, it is essential to avoid using administrative orders or dogmatic judgments to predetermine which views are definitely wrong and which views are definitely correct, and to prohibit in advance those views that are considered wrong. In this way, what may be prohibited is not wrong. Even if it is wrong, but the correct thing does not go through the above-mentioned dialectical process, its development will be slow and its content will be poor. Doing so will bring great harm to the normal development of academia.

    The policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is to prevent the occurrence of this harm and guarantee the normal development of academia in our country.

    These days I had the opportunity to participate in another meeting and listened to Chairman Mao's more instructions on the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend."

    I believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the guarantee and encouragement of this brilliant policy, our country will definitely have a cultural upsurge and an economic construction upsurge to cooperate with each other, so that our country will enter a socialist society as soon as possible.

### 坚决拥护“百花齐放，百家争鸣”政策  冯友兰批判对这一政策的各种怀疑论调

专栏：

    坚决拥护“百花齐放，百家争鸣”政策
    冯友兰批判对这一政策的各种怀疑论调
    我拥护毛主席在最高国务会议里的讲话、周总理和其他领导同志的报告和发言。我是一个教育和科学工作者，特别对于“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策，表示拥护和感谢。
    短时间自然难有伟大著作
    现在有一部分人对于这个政策表示怀疑。他们说：这个政策已经提出来了，为甚么一直到现在，还没有看见有伟大的作品和著作出现呢？因此，他们怀疑这个政策是不是能发生预期的效果。
    这个怀疑我认为是没有根据的。“百花齐放，推陈出新”的政策提出的比较早一点。“百家争鸣”的政策提出来还不到一年，时期还是很短。在短时期内，怎么就会有伟大的著作出来？就是抄也恐怕来不及。这种要求，是太高了一些。
    预防或纠正偏差，
    也应用“争鸣”办法
    还有一部分人恐怕这个政策在施行中会发生偏差。有人认为已经发生偏差了，他们要求纠正偏差，预防偏差。纠正偏差，预防偏差是必要的，但是预防的措施，总不要跟政策的精神相违反。纠正偏差，也不要“因噎废食”。纠正或预防“百家争鸣”的偏差，最好还是用“争鸣”的办法，那就是：讨论研究，批评说服，证明偏差是偏差。如果用别的办法那就不是纠正或预防“百家争鸣”的偏差，而是取消“百家争鸣”了。
    “争鸣”已经开始了
    另有一部分人怀疑，自从“百家争鸣”的政策提出以后，是不是已经有人开始 “争鸣”。清朝有位哲学家颜习斋说过：如果先生说：“往东走”，有一部分学生站起来就往东走，另有一部分学生满口赞美“往东走”，可是坐着不动。当然前者是好学生，后者不能算好学生。这个事例在这里引用，不十分恰当，不过可以作个比喻。领导上提出“百家争鸣”的政策，就譬如是发出“往东走”的信号。我们现在是不是已经有许多人站起来“往东走”，或者大家还都是坐着不动，只是口头上拥护“往东走”呢？就我所知道的，我们现在已经有不少的人开始“往东走”，虽不成“家”，可是已经开始“争鸣”。
    我是搞中国哲学史工作的。近几年来，我们在工作中遇见了不少的困难，不少的问题。自从“百家争鸣”的口号提出以后，我们把这些问题公开地在人民日报上摊出来了。我们有些同志也对于其中的有些比较有关键性的问题，提出初步解决的意见。在这个基础上，北京大学哲学系于1月间曾召集一个座谈会，参加的人很踊跃，讨论也很热烈。会中的发言，后来写成文章，陆续在人民日报、光明日报和其他刊物中发表，一直到现在还没有发表完。将来还要编成一个四十多万字的专辑。
    这个座谈会着重讨论有关哲学史方法论问题，后来讨论集中在两个问题上：一个是哲学史对象（主要是对唯心主义评价）的问题，一个是哲学遗产继承性的问题。这些问题都是很重大、很复杂，不是一时所能完全解决的，但是经过讨论，参加的人得了一些初步的共同认识。时间的限制，我不能把这些共同的认识向大会汇报，但是可以肯定地说，在这些共同认识的基础上，我们的中国哲学史工作是会提高一步的。
    苏联实际上也在“百家争鸣”
    另有一部分人怀疑，苏联为甚么没有提出“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策？这个怀疑也是不必要的。在苏联的学术界，一个科目中，有不同的学派对于这个科目中的某些问题有不同的见解。在一个大学里，一个科目，可以因有不同的学派而设立不止一个教研室。就是在哲学方面，莫斯科大学的哲学系和列宁格勒大学的哲学系就成为两个学派。这些情况，正是苏联学术界所鼓励的。学派与宗派不同，宗派是少数人为个人利益而组织成的小圈子。学派是因学术上的主张不同而形成的派别。宗派是不应该有的，学派是应该有，而且在学术发达的情况中，必然会有的。
    苏联的“哲学问题”杂志的最近一期（1956年第六期）登载有“全苏哲学家联系会议”的一个讨论会的情况（译文登在 “学习译丛”1957年第二期）。我们对于这个报道感到很大的兴趣。因为他们的这个会，也是着重讨论哲学史方法论的问题。讨论也是集中在哲学史的对象和哲学思想发展中的继承性的问题，对于哲学史对象问题，有两派主张的争论。争论的焦点，也和我们的座谈会里的争论基本上相同。
    我们有理由相信，苏联虽没有提出“百家争鸣”的口号，实际上正是在“百家争鸣”。
    照上面看起来，对于“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策的各项怀疑，都是不必要的。
    “百家争鸣”在学术界的别的方面，也正在展开。在遗传学方面，摩尔根派和米丘林派已经很好地在争鸣，我相信在不久的将来，在各门学科中，都会有不同的学派“争鸣”起来。
    当然，“百家争鸣”并不等于“百家” “和平共处”。对于同一问题的不同的见解，可能全都不正确，但不可能全都正确，其间必有争论。争论的结果，对于各种见解，都取其精华（当然有些见解可能没有精华），弃其糟粕，于是这些精华都成为真理的一部分。郭沫若院长在最高国务会议中所说：“百川异流，同归于海”大概就是这个意义。
    能够“同归于海”的，毕竟都是“川”。就是说，必须有一部分正确性的见解，才能有补于真理，若果本来就是完全错误的见解，那就是“断港绝河”，终归自行消灭。但是关于某一问题的不同的见解，特别是牵涉很广、内容复杂的问题，究竟那些是正确的，那些是错误的，还不是可以一望而知的，只有经过讨论争辩，互相批评的过程，正确的才可以逐渐被承认，错误的逐渐被抛弃。这是一个往复曲折的过程，也就是辩证的过程。就是正确的东西，也得经过这个过程，它的发展才会健全，它的内容才会丰富。
    “百花齐放，百家争鸣”政策
    保证我国学术正常发展
    在这个过程中，切忌用行政式的命令，或教条式判断，预先决定那些见解一定错误，那些见解一定正确，把那些认为是错误的见解预先加以禁止。这样，可能被禁止的不是错误的。即令是错误的，但正确的东西，没有经过上面所说的辩证的过程，它的发展，就会迟钝，它的内容，也就会贫乏。这样作，对于学术的正常发展，会带来很大的危害。
    “百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策，就是预防这种危害的发生，保证我国学术的正常发展。
    这几天我有机会参加另一个会议，听了毛主席对于“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策的更多的指示。
    我相信在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在这种英明的政策的保证和鼓励下，我国一定会有一个文化高潮和经济建设的高潮配合起来，使我国早日进入社会主义的社会。
