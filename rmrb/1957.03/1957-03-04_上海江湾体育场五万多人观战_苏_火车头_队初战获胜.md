    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 3rd. The Soviet Lokomotiv Volunteer Sports Association football team defeated the Shanghai Institute of Physical Education football team in Shanghai today with a score of 4-1. The score at halftime was 3-1.
    Shanghai has been experiencing continuous spring rain in recent days. Today, the sun emerged from behind the clouds at noon, and over 50,000 spectators were overjoyed, rushing to Jiangwan Stadium, located 20 li from the city center, to spend their Sunday holiday.
    Today's match was refereed by international referee Fang Rongfu.
    Eight minutes after the kickoff, Soviet Lokomotiv's left-winger Kovalev dribbled past the Shanghai team's defender. The Shanghai team's goalkeeper came out to save the ball but missed, allowing Soviet Lokomotiv's center forward Sokolov to kick it into the goal. The Shanghai team quickly launched a counterattack, scoring a goal in less than two minutes, but it was ruled invalid due to an offside violation. The Soviet Lokomotiv team quickly kicked the ball into the Shanghai team's penalty area, and in the ensuing scramble, Shanghai conceded another goal.
    In the thirteenth minute, the Shanghai team had a corner kick opportunity. Zhao Guanghua, who is skilled at taking corner kicks, precisely placed the ball in front of the goal. Forwards Ma Jinsheng and Jiang Dongchen both jumped up to head the ball, but Tang Wenhou, who was lying on the ground, seized the opportunity to hook the ball into the net, making the score 2-1.
    The Soviet Lokomotiv team will play its second friendly match in Shanghai on the 5th against the China First Machine Sports Association football team.

    上海江湾体育场五万多人观战  苏“火车头”队初战获胜
    据新华社上海3日电  苏联火车头志愿体育协会足球队今天在上海以四比一胜上海体育学院足球队。上半场的比数是三比一。
    连日来上海春雨连绵，今天中午太阳拨云而出，五万多观众喜出望外，赶到离市区二十里远的江湾体育场度过了星期例假。
    今天的比赛由国际裁判方荣富担任裁判员。
    开球以后八分钟，苏联火车头队左翼科瓦廖夫带球越过了上海队的后卫，上海队守门员出来扑球落空，被苏联火车头队中锋索科洛夫踢进门内。上海队迅速反攻，不到两分钟就踢进了一球，但是越位犯规，被判无效。苏联火车头队将球迅速踢到了上海队的禁区，仓卒之中，上海队又输了一球。
    第十三分钟，上海队获得发角球机会，精于发角球的赵光华正好把球踢在门前，前锋马津生、姜栋臣都跃起顶球，被卧倒在地的唐文厚乘机反勾入网，记录成二比一。
    苏联火车头队5日将同中国第一机械体育协会足球队作在上海的第二场友谊比赛。
