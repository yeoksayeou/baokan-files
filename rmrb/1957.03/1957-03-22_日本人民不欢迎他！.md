　　The Japanese People Do Not Welcome Him!
　　Lan Hai
　　The newly appointed American ambassador to Japan, Douglas MacArthur II, arrived in Tokyo on the night of February 15th aboard an American plane. The moment he stepped onto Japanese soil, the song "Ban Atomic Bombs" sung by student representatives immediately resounded at Haneda Airport. Young people shouted: "Yankees go home!" The American ambassador seemed not to believe his ears, but when he steadied himself and looked, a huge banner that shocked him was right in front of him: "Return Okinawa," "Oppose turning Japan into a hydrogen bomb and atomic bomb base," "Abolish the unequal U.S.-Japan treaty," "American devils go home!" Under the illumination of the lights, these slogans emitted a dazzling brilliance. Meanwhile, the "welcome" leaflets distributed by hired thugs fell into dark corners and were trampled under people's feet. Under the protection of Japanese police, the American ambassador gave a speech saying: "I want to better understand Japan!"
　　This newly appointed American ambassador is the nephew of MacArthur, the first Supreme Commander of the American occupation forces in Japan, who once said that "the intelligence of the Japanese is only at the level of a twelve-year-old child." He is also the most trusted right-hand man of Dulles, the well-known war schemer and American Secretary of State. Regardless of how sincere Ambassador MacArthur is in saying he wants to "better understand Japan," since his arrival, he has not had a single day when he has not heard the Japanese people's angry voices against the American government.
　　On the second day of Ambassador MacArthur's inauguration—February 16th—the film "The Bloody Incident at Sunagawa" was screened simultaneously throughout Japan. If the spies that Ambassador MacArthur placed everywhere were loyal to their duties, then they could not help but report to him: In the cinemas, young people were gnashing their teeth and waving their fists, shouting, "Yankees go home!"; women leading their children resentfully said, "There will be no peace as long as the military bases are not removed"; the "Support Sunagawa, Remove U.S. Military Base Movement Donation Box" was filled with money donated by workers and citizens.
　　On the sixth day, February 20th, representatives from all walks of life held a "Japanese People's Pursuit of the Truth About the American Soldier Shooting a Japanese Woman Assembly" in the bustling Shinbashi Station Square in Tokyo. Thousands of workers, farmers, and citizens emerging from the station gathered in the square, which was adorned with slogans such as "Oppose American Soldiers' Atrocities, Guarantee People's Rights," "Protect All Victims of American Military Infringement!", "Guarantee Japan's Independent Judicial Power," and "Abolish Unequal Treaties, Remove U.S. Military Bases." This assembly was jointly convened by the Japan National Anti-Military Base Conference, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the All-Japan Federation of Student Autonomies, the Japan Farmers' Union, the Liberty and Human Rights Association, the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, and other organizations. Representatives from all walks of life unanimously demanded sanctions against the American soldier who shot and killed the Japanese farmer in Soumagahara, the abolition of unequal U.S.-Japan treaties, and the removal of all American military bases in Japan. Amidst passionate emotion, the assembly resolved to protest to the American President and the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Far East Command and to petition the Japanese government, the Diet, and the Japanese judicial authorities.
　　On the ninth day, February 23rd, Ambassador MacArthur received an even more intense letter of protest. On that day, six thousand workers, students, women, and Buddhists gathered at Hibiya Concert Hall in Tokyo for the "National Assembly Demanding the Return of Administrative Rights over Okinawa." Yamashiro Zenko, a representative of the people of Okinawa Prefecture attending the Tokyo assembly, reported on the suffering of the people of Okinawa under the trampling of the American military. He shouted: "Okinawa has been raped by the United States like this. However, Okinawa will never yield. The people of Okinawa will never allow the United States to seize their land! Without protecting Okinawa, there is no protecting peace!" Amidst grief and anger, the assembly made the following resolutions: "Resolution appealing to the United Nations and all countries of the world," "Resolution appealing to the American government," "Resolution appealing to the Japanese Diet and all political parties," "Resolution encouraging the people of Okinawa," etc., and passed a declaration protesting the illegal American interference in Naha's municipal administration, opposing the Price proposal and the Laniel declaration to turn Okinawa into an atomic and hydrogen bomb base, firmly opposing the American dispatch of atomic mobile units to Okinawa, and demanding the immediate return of administrative rights over Okinawa.
　　Five days after this assembly was held—February 28th—was the fifth anniversary of the signing of the U.S.-Japan Administrative Agreement. This agreement stipulated that the United States could establish military bases anywhere on Japanese territory, so this day became a day of extreme resentment for the Japanese people. This caused Ambassador MacArthur another unpleasant event. On this day, six hundred of Japan's most renowned scholars, artists, and cultural figures jointly issued a statement calling for a large-scale national movement to abolish the unequal U.S.-Japan treaty. The joint statement said: "For conscientious Japanese people, the bloody incident in Sunagawa Town that occurred years ago is a heartbreaking and unbearable event. As everyone knows, the root cause of this incident is the San Francisco Peace Treaty system, which is centered on the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and the Administrative Agreement. It can be concluded that a second or third Sunagawa incident will inevitably occur in the future. The time has come to fundamentally reconsider the Administrative Agreement and the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty that forms its basis." This statement was issued to the people nationwide through major Japanese newspapers, radio stations, and television, and it has aroused widespread attention in all sectors of Japan.
　　March 1st was the third anniversary of the American hydrogen bomb test on Bikini Atoll and the victimization of Japanese fishing boats. The "National Assembly to Prevent the Hydrogen Bomb Test on Christmas Island," proposed by the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, was held at the Toyoshima Public Hall in Tokyo. This assembly was also a rally to protest and oppose the American atomic and hydrogen bomb war policy. More than two thousand representatives from all over the country attended. The assembly received forty telegrams from twenty-three countries, including telegrams from Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and Bandaranaike, Prime Minister of Ceylon. These telegrams all expressed support for the efforts of the Japanese people to ban atomic and hydrogen bomb tests. Indian Ambassador to Japan Malik and Egyptian Ambassador to Japan Osman attended the conference as representatives of Asia and Africa, respectively.
　　In his report, Yasui Iku, Secretary-General of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, pointed out: "More than 34 million Japanese people have now signed the petition calling for a ban on atomic and hydrogen bombs. The voices of the Japanese people are prompting the Japanese government to change its policy. When Foreign Minister Kishi Nobusuke met with representatives of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, he said: 'The government will actively assist in the future based on the will of the Japanese people to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs.' We hope that the Kishi Cabinet will truly put this promise into practice."
　　Representatives of various political parties and sectors unanimously expressed their determination to defend peace. Suma Yagoro, a representative of the Liberal Democratic Party, said: "Calling for a ban on atomic and hydrogen bombs is the noble mission of the Japanese people who have suffered disasters three times in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Bikini. Let 90 million Japanese citizens fight together to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs!" Asanuma Inejirō, a representative of the Japan Socialist Party, and Nosaka Sanzo, a representative of the Japanese Communist Party, both pointed out that the Japanese government's behavior in the United Nations General Assembly of not supporting the Soviet Union's proposal to ban hydrogen bomb tests violated the wishes of the Japanese people.
　　A representative of the crew of the Daigo Fukuryū Maru, a partner of Kuboyama Aikichi, a victim of the American hydrogen bomb test on Bikini Atoll, complained at the assembly: "Thinking of March 1st three years ago sends chills down my spine! The testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs must be prohibited!" Tamura Iwa, a representative from Kochi Prefecture, spoke on behalf of all prefectures: "Anger against the hydrogen bomb test on Christmas Island has ignited in villages and towns across the country. Kochi Prefecture's villages and towns have held assemblies and made resolutions to prevent hydrogen bomb tests. Workers will strike, and fishermen will sail to the vicinity of Christmas Island to hold silent protests." Nishimoto Hoshi, a monk representative from the Japan Mountain Myōhōji Temple who went on a hunger strike in front of the British Embassy in Japan to demand a stop to hydrogen bomb tests, said: "Five British peace activists are going to Christmas Island to protest, asking Japanese peace groups to send ships to help. Let's go together too!" All the representatives responded with warm applause. Aoki, the action leader of the Anti-Expansion of Sunagawa Base Alliance, spoke on behalf of the residents of bases nationwide: "In order to save Japan from the danger of atomic war, the American military bases in Japan must be removed." The assembly made a resolution demanding that people all over the world unite and continue to fight to stop atomic war.
　　Although the two weeks since Ambassador MacArthur arrived in Japan have been very short, he should have heard the strong voices of the Japanese people. The war policy currently pursued by the United States is fundamentally contrary to the wishes of the Japanese people. This is the reason why Ambassador MacArthur is not welcomed by the Japanese people. The Japanese people want peace, not war! They want independence and autonomy, not American military bases! This call will surely become higher and louder! (Attached picture)
　　Six thousand representatives from all walks of life in Japan held a mass rally in Tokyo to oppose the United States' use of Okinawa Island as a base for atomic warfare and demanded that the United States return Okinawa.

　　日本人民不欢迎他！
　　蓝海
    美国新任命的驻日大使道格拉斯·麦克阿瑟第二，在2月15日夜间乘美国飞机到了东京。当他踏上日本国土的一瞬间，羽田机场上顿时响起了学生代表合唱的“禁止原子弹”的歌声。青年们高呼：“美国佬滚回去！”这位美国大使似乎不相信自己的耳朵，但当他定神一看，使他吃惊的巨幅标语牌就在眼前：“归还冲绳”，“反对把日本变成氢弹、原子弹基地”，“废除日美不平等条约”，“美国鬼子滚回去！”在灯光的照耀下，这些标语发出刺眼的光辉。同时，那些被雇来的恶棍散发的“欢迎”传单，飘落在黑暗的角落里，踩在人们的脚底下。在日本警察保护下，这位美国大使发表谈话说：“我想更好地了解日本”！
    这位新任的美国大使，就是曾经说过“日本人的智慧只有十二岁小孩的程度”的美国第一任驻日本占领军总司令麦克阿瑟的侄子，也是有名的战争阴谋家美国国务卿杜勒斯最信赖的左右手。不管麦克阿瑟大使要“更好地了解日本”的话有多少诚意，从他到任以来，他没有一天会听不到日本人民对美国政府的愤怒的声音。
    在麦克阿瑟大使就任的第二天——2月16日，日本全国各地一齐放映了“砂川的流血惨案”影片。麦克阿瑟大使在各地布下的密探若能忠于他们的职务，那么他们就不能不这样向他报告：在影院里，青年们都切齿挥拳地喊：“美国佬滚回去”；带领着孩子的妇女怨恨地说：“军事基地一日不撤除，一天也不得安生”；在“支援砂川、撤除美军基地运动捐款箱”里，装满了工人、市民捐献的钱。
    第六天，2月20日，在东京繁华的新桥车站广场，各界代表举行了“日本人民追究美国兵枪杀日本妇女真相大会”。从车站走出的数以千计的工人、农民、市民们，聚集到挂着“反对美兵暴行、保障人民的权利”、“保护一切受到美军侵犯的受害者！”、“保障日本的独立裁判权”、“废除不平等条约、撤除美军基地”等标语的广场中来。这个大会是由日本全国反对军事基地会议、日本工会总评议会、全日本学生自治会总联合会、日本农民工会、自由人权协会、日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会等团体联合召开的。各界代表一致要求制裁在相马原枪杀日本农妇的美兵，废除日美不平等条约和撤除全日本的美军基地。在群情激愤中，大会决议向美国总统、美国远东军总司令提出抗议，向日本政府、国会、日本司法当局请愿。
    第九天，2月23日，麦克阿瑟大使又接到了一份更激烈的抗议书，那天，在东京日比谷音乐堂有六千名工人、学生、妇女、和佛教界人士集会，这就是“要求归还冲绳行政权国民大会”。出席东京大会的冲绳县人民代表山城善光，在会上报告了冲绳人民遭受美军蹂躏的痛苦情况之后，高声喊道：“冲绳就是这样被美国强奸了。但是，冲绳决不屈服，冲绳人民决不允许美国夺去自己的土地！不能保卫冲绳，也就不能保卫和平！”大会在悲痛和愤怒中作出了以下的决议：“向联合国及世界各国呼吁的决议”、“对美国政府呼吁的决议”、“向日本国会及各政党呼吁的决议”、“鼓励冲绳人民的决议”等，并通过了大会宣言，抗议美国非法干涉那霸市政，反对把冲绳变为原子弹氢弹基地的普赖斯建议和兰尼兹尔声明，坚决反对美国派遣原子机动部队到冲绳，并要求立即归还冲绳的行政权。
    这个大会召开后的第五天——2月28日，是签订日美行政协定五周年的日子。这个协定规定了美国可以在日本领土任何地方设置军事基地，所以这一天成了日本人民万分怨恨的日子。这使麦克阿瑟大使又遇到了不愉快的事情。这一天，日本最有名望的学者、艺术家、文化界人士，六百人联合发表声明，呼吁为废除日美不平等条约而掀起一个大规模的国民运动。共同声明说：“对于有良心的日本人说来，年前发生的砂川町流血事件是一个目不忍睹的惨痛事件。人所周知，这一事件的祸根是以日美安全条约和行政协定为主体的旧金山和约体制。可以断定将来必然还会发生第二个或第三个砂川事件。现在从根本上重新考虑行政协定以及形成它的基础的日美安全条约的时候已经来到了”。这个声明通过日本各大报纸、电台和电视向全国人民发出了号召，引起了日本各界的广泛重视。
    3月1日，是美国在比基尼岛试验氢弹、日本渔船受害三周年的纪念日，日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会建议召开的“日本阻止在圣诞岛试验氢弹全国大会”在东京丰岛公会堂举行。这个大会同时也是抗议和反对美国原子弹氢弹战争政策的大会。到会的有全国各地两千多名代表。大会收到二十三个国家的四十封电文，其中包括苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁、锡兰总理班达拉奈克的电文。这些电报都表示支持日本人民为禁止试验原子弹和氢弹所作的努力。印度驻日本大使马里克以亚洲代表的身份，埃及驻日本大使欧斯曼以非洲代表的身份出席了大会。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会事务局长安井郁的报告中指出：“现在已经有三千四百多万日本人在要求禁止原子弹氢弹的呼吁书上签了名。日本人民的呼声正在促使日本政府改变政策。岸信介外相接见日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会的代表时说：‘政府今后将根据日本人民要求禁止原子弹氢弹的意志，积极地予以协助。’我们希望岸内阁真正实践这个诺言。”
    各政党和各界代表发言，一致表示了他们保卫和平的决心。自由民主党代表须磨弥吉郎说：“呼吁禁止原子弹氢弹是曾经在广岛、长崎、比基尼三度遭受灾害的日本民族的崇高使命，九千万日本国民一起为禁止原子弹氢弹而斗争吧！”日本社会党代表浅沼稻次郎和日本共产党代表野坂参三都指出，日本政府代表在联合国大会上不赞成苏联禁止试验氢弹提案的行为，是违背了日本人民的愿望的。
    美国在比基尼岛试验氢弹的受害者久保山爱吉的伙伴、第五福龙丸的船员代表在大会上控诉道：“想起三年前的3月1日就不寒而栗！必须禁止原子弹氢弹的试验！”高知县代表田村岩代表全国各县发言，他说：“在全国各村镇燃起了反对在圣诞岛试验氢弹的怒火。高知县各村镇开了大会，作出了阻止试验氢弹的决议。工人要罢工，渔民要乘船到圣诞岛周围去静坐抗议。”到英国驻日大使馆前绝食要求停止试验氢弹的日本山妙法寺的僧侣代表西本法师说：“英国五名和平爱好者要到圣诞岛去抗议，要求日本和平团体派船帮助。我们也一起去吧！”全体代表报以热烈的掌声。反对扩展砂川基地联盟行动队长青木代表全国基地居民发言：“为了从原子战争危险中把日本拯救出来，必须撤除美国在日本的军事基地。”大会作出决议，要求全世界人民团结起来，为制止原子战争而继续奋斗。
    麦克阿瑟大使到达日本的两周间，时间虽然很短，应该听到了日本人民的强烈呼声。美国目前执行的战争政策，是同日本人民的愿望根本相背驰的。这也就是麦克阿瑟大使不为日本人民所欢迎的原因。日本人民要和平，不要战争！要独立自主，不要美国军事基地！这种呼声一定会越来越高，越来越响！（附图片）
　　日本各界代表六千人在东京举行群众大会，反对美国把冲绳岛作为原子战争基地，要求美国归还冲绳。
