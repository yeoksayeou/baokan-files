Xinhua News Agency, March 18th: According to TASS, Budapest, the "People's Freedom Daily" published on the 17th the resolution of the Provisional Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party "On Certain Issues Concerning the Education of Youth and the Establishment of the Hungarian Communist Youth League."

The resolution, in discussing the October events, pointed out that some elements disguised as communists, such as the Nagy and Losonczy group, as well as some writers, journalists, and intellectual youth, had taken advantage of the mistakes made by the Party and the Hungarian Working Youth League in leading economic life to attack the Party, attempting to shake the youth's confidence in the Party. The enemies of the Hungarian people also attempted to use national sentiments to pit our youth against our liberator, the Soviet Union. The majority of the youth with good intentions hoped to correct mistakes, but they unwittingly, starting from holding demonstrations, actually facilitated the realization of the counter-revolutionaries' aims. And a portion of the youth stood on the side of the counter-revolutionaries.

The major task of the Party and every Hungarian patriot is to explain the essence of the October events to the deceived young men and women. The Party believes that the youth are loyal to the people and loyal to the cause of socialism, and will do everything possible to make Hungarian youth clearly understand the tragic events that occurred not long ago.

The resolution, after pointing out the role and achievements of the Hungarian Working Youth League, said that it is now necessary to establish a youth organization that can utilize the experiences of the Hungarian Working Youth League and other youth organizations, but no longer repeat their mistakes. There are currently many youth organizations in Hungary. At the time of their establishment, the enemy had done their utmost to seize leadership. Young men and women truly loyal to the cause of socialism defeated these attacks and strengthened their organizations day by day. However, despite the achievements of youth organizations, the current state of the youth movement is not satisfactory. Therefore, it is necessary to establish the Hungarian Communist Youth League, which should be the youth organization of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party.

The basic tasks of the Youth League are to serve the cause of building a socialist society, to fight for the realization of the Party's goals among the broadest strata of youth, and to educate youth in the spirit of communism. Other youth organizations can coexist with the Youth League. Comprehensively helping student organizations and Young Pioneers is an important task of the Youth League.

The resolution concluded by saying that it should be guaranteed that the Youth League enjoys practical rights in all aspects of national and social life. The Party's assistance to the Youth League should not take the form of orders.

    动员青年为建成社会主义而斗争
    匈牙利决定建立共青团
    社会主义工人党将加强对青年的思想教育
    据新华社18日讯　据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：“人民自由报”17日刊载了匈牙利社会主义工人党临时中央委员会“关于教育青年的某些问题和建立匈牙利共产主义青年团”的决议。
    决议在谈到十月事件时指出，一些以共产党员作伪装的分子，如纳吉和洛松齐集团以及部分作家、记者和知识青年曾经利用党和匈牙利劳动青年联盟在领导经济生活的工作中所犯的错误来向党进攻，想借此动摇青年对党的信心。匈牙利人民的敌人还企图利用民族感情使我国青年同我们的解放者——苏联对立起来。大部分怀着善良愿望的青年，希望纠正错误，但是他们不由自主地从举行示威游行开始时起，实际上促成了反革命分子目的的实现。而一部分青年站在反革命分子一边了。
    党和每一个匈牙利爱国人士的重大任务是向受欺骗的青年男女解释十月事件的实质。党相信青年是忠于人民，忠于社会主义事业的，并且将尽一切力量使匈牙利青年明确认识不久前所发生的悲惨事件。
    决议在指出匈牙利劳动青年联盟的作用和功绩以后说，现在必须建立一个能运用匈牙利劳动青年联盟和其他青年团体的经验、但是不再犯它们的错误的青年组织。现在匈牙利有许多青年组织。在它们建立的时候，敌人曾经尽了最大努力来夺取领导权。真正忠于社会主义事业的男女青年击败了这些进攻，一天天加强自己的组织。但是，尽管青年组织是有成绩的，目前青年运动状况还不能令人满意。因此，必须建立匈牙利共产主义青年团，它应当是匈牙利社会主义工人党的青年组织。
    青年团的基本任务是为建成社会主义社会的事业服务，为在最广泛阶层的青年中实现党的目的和以共产主义精神教育青年而斗争。其他青年组织是可以和青年团同时存在的。全面帮助学生组织和少年先锋队是青年团的一项重要任务。
    决议最后说，应当保证青年团在国家和社会生活各方面享有实际权利。党对青年团的帮助不应当采取命令形式。
