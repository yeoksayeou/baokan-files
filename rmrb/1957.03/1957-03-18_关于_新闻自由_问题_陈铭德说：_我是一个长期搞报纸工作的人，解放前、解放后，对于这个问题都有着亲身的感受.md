    On the Issue of "Freedom of the Press"
    Chen Mingde said: "I have been working in newspapers for a long time, and I have personal feelings about this issue both before and after Liberation..."
    Recently, when discussing the issue of capitalist democracy and socialist democracy, some people are said to have doubts: Does our country really have "freedom of the press"?
    I am someone who has been working in newspapers for a long time, and I have personal feelings about this issue both before and after Liberation. I would like to take this opportunity to talk about the issue of "freedom of the press" that many people are currently concerned about.
    First, let us recall the situation before Liberation: Everyone remembers that in the reactionary ruling organs of the Kuomintang, there was a set of heinous news censorship systems. This system was established to restrict freedom of the press and persecute progressive journalists. At that time, every word, every title, even marriage announcements, in the newspapers had to be reviewed by the censorship authorities. Only those approved could be published, and those not approved could not be published. Therefore, "blank spaces" (empty blocks) in newspapers and lines of ×× in some articles were commonplace. I remember that at that time, the "Nanjing Renbao" newspaper in Nanjing submitted a commentary for review, but it was not allowed to be published. The next day, they had to publish six large characters "Nothing to Say Today" in the editorial position. In fact, how could there be nothing to say? In that kind of society, there was so much to say, but the Kuomintang reactionary rulers did not allow it! Later, the means of oppression intensified, and even the freedom to "leave blank spaces" was prohibited. Not only that, they also adopted various methods against newspapers and periodicals with progressive tendencies and those that dared to reflect the real situation, such as restricting the number of copies distributed, not allocating or allocating less paper, destroying newspaper offices, and beating and arresting journalists, to force the normal operation of newspapers to be impossible. If the news and opinions of the newspapers and periodicals damaged the interests of the Kuomintang ruling class, then warnings, suspensions, and closures would immediately befall the newspaper offices. Needless to say, the Chongqing "Xinhua Daily" was closed down by the Kuomintang reactionary rule, and the "Wenhui Daily" and "United Evening News" were also subjected to closure. Even the "Xinmin Bao" in various places, which could not be said to be very progressive at the time, I and my colleagues were constantly threatened and persecuted, insulted, detained, or arrested. The "Xinmin Bao" in Nanjing and Chengdu were eventually sealed up.
    Does the United States, which boasts of being a "democratic" country, have "freedom of the press"? I will only cite one example that everyone knows to illustrate this issue. The English "Millard's Review" was published in Shanghai for more than 30 years. This newspaper had a large readership in the United States. During the Korean War, it reported the facts of the United States conducting bacteriological warfare, so the US government blocked it, not allowing it to be sent to the United States. With the sharp decline in sales, this newspaper was forced to cease publication in 1953. The editor-in-chief, Powell, had to return to the United States. After he and his wife returned, the US government immediately summoned them several times on charges of "incitement" and "rebellion" and ordered all agencies not to hire them. Until now, they are still being persecuted by the US government.
    Judging from these facts, whether in old China or in the United States, which talks about "democracy and freedom," it can be said with certainty that there is no "freedom of the press" at all. If you insist on saying "yes," it is nothing more than the freedom to arbitrarily publish yellow news; the freedom of internal contradictions and mutual scolding within the ruling class; and the freedom of those rumor-mongering organs, such as "Central News Agency" and "Voice of America," to arbitrarily distort facts, reverse black and white, and poison and deceive the broad masses of the people. For example, they are clamoring in the newspapers every day about "communist aggression"; calling the counter-revolutionary riots they created single-handedly in Hungary a "revolution to liberate the Hungarian people"; and saying that the "Eisenhower Doctrine," which attempts to enslave the people of the Middle East, is "friendly aid" to the people of the Middle East, and so on. The so-called "objectivism" and "freedom of the press" are nothing but lies to deceive the people.
    Everyone knows that in our country, not only is there no news censorship system and news censorship agency, but our constitution also explicitly stipulates that citizens have freedom of speech, publication...etc., and the state also provides various conveniences to ensure that citizens enjoy these freedoms. The facts are also exactly like this. The various newspaper offices in our country are all responsible to the people. Under the premise of conforming to the interests of the country and the people, we implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. Newspaper offices can freely handle various manuscripts, select nutritious materials, and make spiritual food for the people. The People's Government has never stipulated any news censorship system or used other administrative orders to restrict it. On the contrary, in the work of interviewing, editing, publishing, and distribution, we can get help and support from all aspects. Open any of our newspapers in the past few years and see, not only journalists, but also ordinary citizens, freely express their opinions on major national events and some social issues in the newspapers. For shortcomings and errors in the work, no matter what agency or anyone in any position is involved, as long as it is true, they can be exposed and criticized. Was this possible in the years of Kuomintang reactionary rule? At that time, if newspapers and periodicals slightly offended dignitaries, they would be unexpectedly attacked. Even when Japanese imperialism occupied our Northeast, the slogan "Down with Japanese Imperialism" could only be replaced by "Down with ×× Imperialism" in the newspapers.
    Perhaps some people will ask: Since the news in our country is free, why do our newspapers have less news than newspapers in Western countries? Why are news from "Associated Press," "Reuters," and "Agence France-Presse" not published or not published in full? These questions, at first glance, seem to make some sense. In fact, since there have been newspapers, any newspaper in the world has been selective about news. What is the standard of selection? It is the class interests represented by this newspaper. The newspapers of imperialist countries, how can they like to publish news releases from our Xinhua News Agency and TASS? We also have our standards for selecting manuscripts, that is, whether it is beneficial to the country and whether it is beneficial to the people as mentioned above. May I ask: What good does it do to readers to publish reactionary and toxic things in newspapers? There is a lot of yellow news in American newspapers, and features about murder and robbery are often published in a large section. As a result, these yellow news have become textbooks for teaching people to do evil. American people's morality is deteriorating day by day, and crime incidents are emerging one after another. American newspapers cannot but bear part of the responsibility. Do we want this?
    A basic issue is that in a class society, any newspaper serves a certain class. The newspapers of the bourgeoisie, no matter how they boast, serve the interests of the bourgeoisie. Our newspapers are an important propaganda weapon for socialist construction and serve the working class and the broad masses of the people. Therefore, talking about "freedom of the press" must also be subject to this general requirement. Abstract, supra-class freedom does not exist, and absolute personal freedom is not what socialist democracy should contain.
    Therefore, from my personal feelings in two different societies, I believe that our freedom of the press is the freedom of the press of the socialist democratic system. It is the freedom of the press obtained through the struggle against the enemy. We must cherish this freedom and be good at using it to combat the enemy, educate the masses, and maintain and continuously promote the great socialist cause of our country.

    关于“新闻自由”问题
    陈铭德说：“我是一个长期搞报纸工作的人，解放前、解放后，对于这个问题都有着亲身的感受……”
    近来，在谈论到资本主义民主和社会主义民主的问题时，据说有的人怀疑：我们国家究竟有没有“新闻自由”。
    我是一个长期搞报纸工作的人，解放前、解放后，对于这个问题都有着亲身的感受，愿意就这个机会，来谈谈目前很多人关心的“新闻自由”问题。
    首先，让我们回忆一下解放前的情况：大家还记得，在国民党反动统治机关中，有一套罪恶很多的新闻检查制度，这套制度是为了限制新闻自由和迫害进步报人而设的。那时候，报纸上的每一个字，每一个题目，连结婚启事在内，都要经过检查机关审查，批准可以登的才能登，没有批准的就不能登，所以，报纸上“开天窗”（空白一块）和在某些文章中打满成行的××，是司空见惯的。记得当时南京有一家报纸“南京人报”的评论送去审查，结果不准刊登，第二天只好在社论的地位上刊出六个大字“今日无话可说”。其实，何尝是无话可说呢，在那样的社会里，要说的话多得很，只是国民党反动统治者不准说罢了！后来，压迫手段变本加厉，连“开天窗”的自由也被禁止掉了。不仅如此，它们对具有进步倾向和比较敢于反映真实情况的报刊，还采取限制发行数量，不配给或少配给纸张，捣毁报社和殴打、逮捕新闻工作者等层出不穷的办法，来迫使报纸工作不能正常进行。如果报刊的新闻、言论损害了国民党统治阶级的利益，那末，警告、停刊、封闭等处分，就会立刻降临到报社的头上。不用说，重庆“新华日报”是被国民党反动统治封闭的， “文汇报”“联合晚报”等也都遭到过封闭的处分。就是在当时还说不上怎样进步的各地“新民报”，我和我的同事们，都曾随时受到威胁迫害，受侮辱或拘押逮捕。南京和成都两地的“新民报”终于被查封了事。
    自吹为“民主”国家的美国，是不是就有“新闻自由”呢？我只举一个大家都知道的事例来说明这个问题。英文密勒氏评论报曾经在上海刊行了三十多年，这个报在美国国内是拥有广大读者群众的。在朝鲜战争期间，它报导了美国进行细菌战的事实，因而美国政府就封锁它，不让它寄往美国。在销数锐减的情况下，这家报纸在1953年被迫停刊了。报纸的主编人鲍惠尔只得回到美国。他和他的爱人回去后，美国政府立即以“煽动”“叛乱”等罪名，几次三番地传讯他们，并通令一切机关不予录用。直到现在，他们还在被美国政府继续迫害中。
    从这些事实来看，不论是在旧中国或者是在高谈“民主自由”的美国，可以肯定地说，是没有半点“新闻自由”的。如果硬说“有”的话，不外乎任意刊载黄色新闻的自由；统治阶级内部矛盾、互相对骂的自由；和那些造谣机关，如“中央社”、“美国之音”等任意歪曲事实，颠倒黑白，毒害、欺骗广大人民的自由。例如：它们天天在报上叫嚣什么“共产主义侵略”；把他们在匈牙利一手制造的反革命暴动，叫做“解放匈牙利人民的革命”；把妄图奴役中东人民的“艾森豪威尔主义”，说成是对中东人民的“友好援助”等等。所谓“客观主义”、 “新闻自由”都不外是欺骗人民的鬼话而已。
    谁都知道，在我们的国家里，不仅没有新闻检查制度和新闻检查机关，而且，我们的宪法还明文规定了公民有言论、出版……等自由，国家还给予种种便利，来保证公民享受这些自由。事实也正是这样。我们国家的各个报社，都是对人民负责的。在符合国家、人民利益的前提下，贯彻百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针。报社可以自由地处理各种稿件，选择富于营养的原料，为人民制作精神食粮。人民政府从没有规定过什么新闻检查制度，或用其他行政命令来限制。相反，在采访、编辑、出版、发行等工作中，都能得到各方面的帮助和支持。翻开几年来我们的任何一种报纸看看，不只是新闻工作者，就是普通的公民，对于国家大事和一些社会问题，也都自由地在报上发表自己的意见。对于工作中的缺点和错误，不管涉及什么机关或任何职务的人，只要是真实的，都可以进行揭露和批评。这些，在国民党反动统治的年代里，是能够的吗？那时，报刊稍为触犯达官贵人，就会遭到意外的打击，就连日本帝国主义侵占了我国东北，报纸刊登“打倒日本帝国主义”这句口号，都只能用“打倒××帝国主义”来代替。
    也许有人会问：既然我们国家的新闻是自由的，为什么我们的报纸不如西方国家报纸消息多？为什么对“美联社”、“路透社”、“法新社”等发出的新闻不予刊登或不全文刊登呢？这些问题，乍听起来，似乎有些道理。其实，自有报纸以来，世界上任何报纸对于新闻都是有选择的。选择的标准是什么？就是这个报刊所代表的阶级利益。帝国主义国家的报纸，它又何尝喜欢刊载我们新华社、塔斯社所发的新闻稿呢？我们选择稿件也有我们的标准，那就是上面所说的是否有利于国家、是否有利于人民。试问：把反动的、有毒素的东西，刊登在报纸上，对读者有什么好处呢？美国的报纸上黄色新闻很多，杀人越货之类的特写，常常登了一大版。结果呢，这些黄色新闻成了教人为非作歹的教科书。美国人民道德日益败坏，犯罪事件层出不穷，美国报纸不能不负一部分责任，难道我们愿意这样吗？
    一个基本的问题，就是：在阶级社会里，任何报刊都是为一定的阶级服务的，资产阶级的报刊，不管它们怎样自我标榜，都是为资产阶级利益服务的。我们的报刊，是进行社会主义建设的一个重要的宣传武器，是为工人阶级和广大人民群众服务的。因此，谈“新闻自由”，也就要服从于这个总的要求。抽象的、超阶级的自由是不存在的，绝对的个人自由，不是社会主义民主所应有的内容。
    因此，从我个人在两个不同社会的亲身感受中，我认为，我们的新闻自由是社会主义民主制度的新闻自由。是与敌人斗争所获得的新闻自由，我们必须珍视这个自由，一定要善于运用它来打击敌人，教育群众，维护和不断推进我国伟大的社会主义事业。
