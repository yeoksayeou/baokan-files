Review of the Film "Li Shizhen"
    Gu Zhongyi

"Li Shizhen" is the first biographical film since liberation with the historical struggles of an ancient Chinese scientist as its theme. It depicts the arduous and heroic life of Li Shizhen, a medical scientist of the Ming Dynasty in China, who, in the face of feudal rulers' contempt for medicine and oppression of the people, struggled to revise "Ben Cao" (Materia Medica), and finally wrote a scientific masterpiece of world significance, "Ben Cao Gang Mu" (Compendium of Materia Medica). Li Shizhen not only brilliantly summarized the valuable experience accumulated by the Chinese medical community over thousands of years, laying the scientific foundation of Chinese medicine, and making brilliant contributions to the world medical community, but also his spirit of hard work and perseverance profoundly moved and educated us.

The greatest achievement of this film is that the directors and actors grasped Li Shizhen's spirit of arduous struggle and perseverance, and made it run through many scenes. One of the most unforgettable scenes is: Li Shizhen and his father, Li Yuechi, saw a large grain boat on the river, being laboriously dragged forward by twenty or thirty tattered and barefoot trackers in the turbulent rapids. His father said to him: "...Your life will be like this boat, always in the rapids, but you still have to move forward!" This scene appeared three times in this film, deeply educating Li Shizhen and deeply educating us. His whole life was spent in the rapids. After he discovered the errors in the "Rihua Ben Cao", he decided to revise "Ben Cao". His father warned him that revising "Ben Cao" would cost a lot of manpower and money, and only the imperial court could do it. But he was not afraid. He fought against the stubborn and conservative Bao squire, against the charlatans who cheated people of money, against the sycophantic and oppressive hospital directors, and against some opportunistic and mediocre doctors. After he was disillusioned with the imperial court, he decided to return to his hometown and mobilize the masses to help him complete this arduous and great undertaking. He took his apprentice Pang Xian and Lao Wei all over the famous mountains and rivers of the country, collecting medicinal specimens, away from home for five or six years, braving the scorching heat and severe cold, with calluses on his hands and feet. Finally, on Wudang Mountain, he encountered the unreasonable leader of the Taoist priests, who threw his notes, which were the result of his hard work, into the fire. Lao Wei risked his life to snatch the notes and ran away, but was unfortunately caught up by the Taoists, pushed off a cliff, and died. The remnants of the notes were also washed away by the flood. He suffered such a serious blow, but he was not discouraged. He "started from scratch" and spent several more years before returning home fully loaded. He closed himself up to write, working day and night, for thirty years as one day. Finally, at the age of seventy, he completed the great task and wrote the thick "Ben Cao Gang Mu" in fifty-two volumes, piled high on a piano table. The whole book records a total of 1,892 kinds of medicines, 374 new medicines, and 1,161 prescriptions. Such a vast masterpiece, which generally required the imperial court to summon hundreds or thousands of medical talents to complete, was completed by him alone. But even though the book was written, the difficulties did not end. Tian Heng, who had agreed to publish the book earlier, was arrested by the government, and the bookstore was closed. Although Bao squire was willing to print it for him, he wanted to force him to modify the contents. In the end, he was willing to pawn his property and give everything he had, but by the time the book was published, he had passed away. This film summarizes the important events of his life's struggle, and also depicts his tenacious and unyielding fighting spirit.

The reason why Li Shizhen was able to complete such a huge undertaking by himself was, on the one hand, due to his perseverance and unyielding will, but on the other hand, it was also because he was able to go deep into the masses and rely on the masses. When he practiced medicine, he did not ask about wealth or poverty, and treated people with benevolence, so the masses loved and were close to him. When he posted notices on the street, soliciting herbs and prescriptions, many people came to offer them in person, and his house was very lively. Farmers such as Lao Zhang, Lao Wang, and Lao Du were representative figures who helped him. He mingled with the herb farmers on the road, and gained many new varieties, new knowledge, and care in life. When he left the Taiyuan Hospital, his teacher, Zeng Xiang, gave him all the Ben Cao books he had annotated in the past thirty years. Although Tian Heng was unable to publish his work for him, his spiritual encouragement and help was great. This point is emphasized in several places in the film, which is very important.

The artistic handling of the important events in Li Shizhen's life in this film can be said to be concise and clear. From his abandoning fame and fortune to study medicine with his father, to arguing with Bao squire and discovering the errors in the old Ben Cao, to resolving to revise Ben Cao, is the beginning of the play. From entering the Chu Prince's Mansion to leaving the Taiyuan Hospital, the play gradually enters a tense stage. From saying goodbye to his wife and children and entering the mountains to collect medicine, to encountering the greatest setback on Wudang Mountain, is the climax of the play. The three of them, master and disciples, climbed to the peak, discovered many exotic flowers and herbs, and were overjoyed. Li Shizhen lay in the flowers, closed his eyes and indulged. After years of hard work, they gained unexpected gains. As they happily returned, suddenly the sound of gongs rang loudly, and many Taoist priests rushed up and dragged them to the old Taoist priest...Years of hard work were in vain – a fierce resonance of sudden joy and sorrow was stirred up in the hearts of our audience – this is the most exciting part of the whole play. Secondly, the scene in the wooden hut on the dangerous cliff, where Li Shizhen threaded a needle to mend clothes, chanted poems and thought of his home, was delicate, affectionate, and intriguing, and was also a deeply moving good play. Afterwards, after the dialogue of "starting from scratch", the director only used one shot of Li Shizhen and his apprentice Pang Xian walking towards the distant mountains and fields to depict their hard work for several years, and immediately followed by the Sanhuang Temple Fair. In terms of directing techniques, it is very concise. The narration of thirty years of writing was clearly explained by the director with only fifteen dissolving and dissolving shots, which is both labor-saving and clean, and can be said to be a stroke of genius.

Comrade Zhao Dan's superb acting skills added a lot to this film. His deep and emotional performance, calm and restrained, the flexible use of his eyes and facial muscles, and the changes in his low and impassioned voice, express Li Shizhen's enthusiasm, integrity, decisiveness, determination, fearlessness of difficulties, and endurance of suffering. At the same time, Li Shizhen's tenderness and lingering affection for his wife, his care and sympathy for patients, his frankness and generosity towards friends, his enthusiasm and love for the masses, and his gnashing hatred for his enemies, and his insistence on reason, were all performed meticulously and appropriately. Shu Shi's role as Li Yuechi, although not many scenes, performed the demeanor of an old Chinese scholar in a polite, refined, and detached manner. Kang Tai's Pang Xian was young and handsome, loyal and devoted, took care of his teacher in every possible way, and was consistent throughout, becoming Li Shizhen's capable assistant, and also performed extremely well.

This film also has many shortcomings. The most important, according to my immature opinion, is that the story is thin, the characters are not clear enough, the atmosphere of life is not strong enough, and it seems a bit bland. Some scenes only play the role of explaining the plot and illustrating the process, without deepening them. Take the scene of Li Shizhen's struggle with the hospital director and mediocre doctors in the Taiyuan Hospital as an example. Here, only one scene in the Taiyuan Hospital's deliberation hall and a section of Zeng Xiang's lectures were arranged to set off the struggle. It cannot explain the arduousness of the struggle, nor can it portray the lackeys of feudal rulers such as the hospital director and the left judge in more detail and profoundly. From the film, the hospital director is just a昏愦and incompetent old man, and the left judge is just a shallow rogue. It is too simple to describe Li Shizhen's enemies in this way. This scene gives me the impression that there is too much skeleton and not enough flesh and blood.

Because the plot is relatively thin, some characters have become tools for explaining events. In addition to Li Shizhen himself being portrayed more vividly and deeply, other supporting characters only leave a shallow impression on the audience. Li Yuechi only wrote about his demeanor. Bao squire is just an unreasonable official and gentry. His sinister side should have been portrayed in the later scenes of book publication, but it was only lightly touched upon. The masses, Lao Zhang, Lao Wang, Lao Du and others, are even more like wooden statues, giving people no sense of reality at all. Good character portrayals can leave an unforgettable impression even with only one or two shots. Of course, it must be said that historical figures, especially real historical figures, have their limitations. Reference materials are very scarce, and the performance methods of ancient costumes in movies are still being explored. Relatively speaking, the ancient costume performance method of this film can break away from the "body movements" of the traditional stage performance method and be closer to the realistic performance method, which is already extremely difficult.

This film should be said to be a successful work, because it has left an indelible impression of the spirit of hard struggle and the glorious image of the ancient Chinese scientist Li Shizhen in our hearts, and has educated and encouraged us extremely profoundly. (Attached picture)

    评影片“李时珍”
    顾仲彝
    “李时珍”是解放以来第一部以中国古代科学家的奋斗历史为题材的传记电影。它描写了中国明代医学家李时珍为了重修本草的艰巨任务，在封建统治者轻视医学、压迫人民的情况下艰苦地英勇地奋斗了一生，终于写成了一部具有世界意义的科学巨著“本草纲目”。李时珍不但天才地总结了中国医学界数千年来积累下来的宝贵经验，奠定了中国医学的科学基础，对世界医学界作出了辉煌的贡献，并且他的艰苦奋斗百折不挠的精神也深刻地感动和教育了我们。
    这部电影的最大成就就是编导演员掌握了李时珍的艰苦卓绝百折不挠的战斗精神，使它贯彻在许多镜头里。最使人难忘的一个镜头是：李时珍和他的父亲李月池在江边看到一条大粮船在汹涌澎湃的逆流里，由二、三十个破衣跣足的纤夫吃力地拖拉着前进。他父亲对他说：“……你的一生就要像这条船一样，一生都在逆流里，可还得往前进！”这镜头在这部电影里重复出现了三次，深深地教育了李时珍，也深深地教育了我们。他一生都在逆流里。从他发现日华本草里的错误之后，就决定要修本草。父亲警告他修本草要花费很大的人工和财力，只有朝廷才能修。但他不怕。他和顽固守旧的包乡绅斗争，和骗人钱物的方士斗争，和媚上压下的院使斗争，和一些趋炎附势的庸医斗争。他对朝廷绝望之后，决心回乡发动群众来帮助他完成这件艰巨而伟大的事业。他带了徒弟庞宪和老魏走遍全国名山大川，搜集药材标本，离家五六年，冒着炎暑严寒，手足胼胝，最后在武当山上，却遇着蛮不讲理的方士首领，把他心血换来的札记投入火中。老魏冒死抢出札记逃跑，不幸被道士们追上，推下绝壁，终以身殉，而札记残本也被洪水冲失。他遭到这样严重的打击，但是并不沮丧，“从头做起”，又花了几年功夫，才满载而归。他闭门著书，日夜辛劳，三十年如一日，终于在他七十岁那年，全功告成，写成了厚厚五十二卷、高高堆满了一张琴桌的“本草纲目”。全书共记录了药类一千八百九十二种，新药三百七十四种，单方一千一百六十一个。这样浩大的巨著，一般需要朝廷号召几百几千个医学人才才能完成的巨业，竟由他一人完成了。但书虽写成，困难并没有终止。早先约定刊书的田恒，被官府抓了去，书店也被封闭；包乡绅虽然愿意代他刊印，但要强迫他修改内容。他最后情愿典卖产业，倾其所有，但是等书刊出，他已与世长逝了。这部电影概括了他一生奋斗的重要事迹，也描写了他的坚韧不屈的奋斗精神。
    李时珍之所以能以一人之力完成这么巨大的事业，一方面固然由于他的坚持到底不屈不挠的毅力，但另一方面也是由于他能深入群众，依靠群众。他在行医时，不问贫富，仁爱救人，所以群众都爱护他，亲近他。当他在街上招贴，征求药草和方单时，就有许多人前来面献，家里进进出出，非常热闹；老张、老王、老杜等农民就是帮助他的群众的代表人物。他在路上和药农们打成一片，得到了许多新品种、新知识和生活上的照顾。他离开太医院时，曾祥老师把他三十年来批过的本草书都送给了他。田恒虽然没能替他刊出著作，但对他精神上的鼓励和帮助是很大的。这一点在电影里有好几处着重地描写出来，是十分重要的。
    这部电影对李时珍一生重要事迹的艺术处理可以说概括精练，层次分明。从他舍弃功名随父学医起到与包乡绅争吵发现旧本草错误到决心修本草止，是戏的起点。从进楚王府到离开太医院，戏已逐渐进入紧张阶段。从告别妻儿，入山采药，到武当山遇到最大的挫折，是戏的高潮。他们师徒三人爬上高峰，发现许多奇花异草，惊喜若狂，李时珍躺在花丛里闭目陶醉，他们几年辛苦，到此又得到意外收获，欢欣言旋之际，忽然锣声大响，冲上来许多道士把他们拖到老道士前……几年辛劳尽付流水——在我们观众心里掀起了忽喜忽忧的激烈共鸣——这是全剧中最精彩的一段。其次，危岩木屋一场，李时珍穿针补衣，咏诗想家，细腻深情，耐人寻味，也是感人很深的好戏。之后，编导在“从头做起”的对话之后只用一个镜头，李时珍、庞宪师徒二人向山野远处走去，来描写他们又辛苦了几年，马上接到三皇庙会，在编导手法上，是非常精练的。三十年著书的叙述，编导只用十五个化入化出的镜头交代得清清楚楚，又省事，又干净，真可说是神采之笔。
    赵丹同志的精湛演技使这部影片增色不少。他的深厚感情的表演，沉着含蓄，眼神和脸部筋肉的灵活使用，低沉和激昂的声音的变化，表演出李时珍的热情，正直，果断，坚决，不怕困难，忍受痛苦的内心活动；同时李时珍对妻子的温柔缠绵，对病家的关怀同情，对朋友们的豪爽坦率，对群众们的热情和爱，对敌人们的咬牙痛恨，据理力争，也都表演得丝丝入扣，恰如其分。舒适的李月池的戏虽然不多，但中国老学者的风度却表演得彬彬有礼，潇洒脱俗。康泰的庞宪少年英俊，忠心耿耿，对老师照顾备至，始终如一，成了李时珍得力的助手，也演得极其称职。
    这部电影也有不少缺点，最主要的，根据我不成熟的看法，是故事性单薄，人物性格不够明朗，生活气息不够浓厚，显得平淡一些。有些场面，只起到交代情节说明过程的作用，而没有加以深化。就以李时珍在太医院同院使和庸医们斗争的一场戏来看吧，在这里只安排了太医院议事厅一场戏以及曾祥讲学偶遇的一段衬托，既不能说明斗争的艰苦性，也没有把院使左判这类封建统治者的爪牙画得更细致些深刻些；从电影里看来院使只是个昏愦无能的老人，而左判只是个浅薄的流氓，这样描写李时珍的敌人是过于简单了些。这场戏给我一个印象：骨骼有余，血肉不足。
    由于故事情节比较单薄，某些人物也就成了交代事件的工具了。除了李时珍本人刻划比较生动深刻外，其他陪衬的人物都只在观众印象中留下浅薄的印象。李月池只写出了他的神态。包乡绅只是个蛮不讲理的官绅。他的阴险一面理应在后面刊书的几场戏里刻划出来，但也只轻轻几笔就带过去了。群众老张、老王、老杜等人更是木偶雕像而已，给人没有一点真实感。好的人物刻划就是一两个镜头也能留下使人难忘的印象。当然，话也得说回来，历史人物，尤其是历史中真实人物有它的局限性，参考资料非常贫乏，古装人物在电影里的表演方法也还在摸索中；比较来说这部电影的古装表演方法，能脱出舞台的传统表演方法的“身段”，而更接近于现实主义的表演方法，已是极不容易的了。
    这部电影应该说还是成功的作品，因为它使中国古代科学家李时珍的艰苦奋斗的精神和他的光辉的形象在我们心里留下了不可磨灭的印象，极其深刻地教育和鼓舞了我们。（附图片）
