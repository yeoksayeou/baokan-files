Xinhua News Agency, March 9th: Gaza News: Tens of thousands of Arabs yesterday celebrated their liberation from Israeli occupation in Gaza City and other cities in the Gaza Strip.

    Everywhere on the walls of houses and treetops in Gaza City were images of President Nasser. Main streets were hung with many slogans and banners, which read:
	“Gaza is part of Egypt,” “Welcome peaceful troops, this is the first step for Gaza to return to Egypt,” “No force can separate us from Egypt.” Tens of thousands of people waved flags, danced in the streets, beat drums, played flutes, and some even fired shots into the air in accordance with typical Arab traditional celebrations.

    The main streets of Gaza City were lined with UN Emergency Force soldiers holding short sticks and guns with fixed bayonets. The masses held peaceful demonstrations in the streets, chanting: "Long live Nasser," "The UN Emergency Force is a welcome guest, but not an occupier," "We will never allow the internationalization of Gaza."

    At a rally of 50,000 people, a pledge was passed that Gaza would only accept Egyptian administration. Local leaders, speaking at the meeting, demanded the return of Gaza to Egypt and opposed the internationalization of Gaza. Speakers expressed regret that the UN Emergency Force did not allow residents who fled Gaza during the Israeli occupation to return.

    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 9th: Sharm el-Sheikh News: The last batch of Israeli troops on Egyptian territory left Sharm el-Sheikh, located on the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula and bordering the Gulf of Aqaba, by boat in the afterglow of sunset on the afternoon of March 8. The Finnish unit of the UN Emergency Force subsequently took over this piece of Egyptian territory from which the invaders had finally withdrawn.

    Except for twelve Israeli technicians who remained to assist the UN Emergency Force in establishing control over Sharm el-Sheikh, there are no Israeli troops at all in Sharm el-Sheikh and Tiran Island in the Gulf of Aqaba.

    So far, the British, French, and Israeli troops who launched a war of aggression against the Egyptian people four months ago have been completely driven out of Egyptian territory, and the Israeli troops have been forced to retreat behind the 1949 armistice line.

    加沙人民欢庆解放　要求重归埃及沙姆
    沙伊赫和蒂朗岛已无以色列军队
    新华社9日讯　加沙消息：数以万计的阿拉伯人昨日在加沙市和加沙地带的其他城市欢庆他们从以色列的占领下获得解放。
    加沙市的房屋墙上和树梢到处是纳赛尔总统的像。通衢大街上悬挂着许多标语和横旗，上面写着：
  “加沙是埃及的一部分”，“欢迎和平的部队，这是加沙重归埃及的第一步”，“任何力量都不能把我们同埃及分离开”。上万的群众有的摇着旗帜，有的在街上跳舞，有的打鼓、吹笛子，有的还按照典型的阿拉伯人的传统庆祝方式向空中鸣枪。
    加沙市的主要街道上站着手拿短棍和上好刺刀的枪的联合国紧急部队。群众在街道上举行了和平的示威游行，他们高呼：“纳赛尔万岁”，“联合国紧急部队是受欢迎的客人，但不是占领者”，“我们决不允许加沙国际化”。
    在一次五万人的集会上通过了加沙只接受埃及的管理的誓言。当地的领袖们在会上讲话时要求加沙归还埃及和反对加沙国际化。发言者对联合国紧急部队不准许在以色列占领时逃离加沙的居民归来表示遗憾。
    新华社开罗9日电　沙姆沙伊赫消息：在埃及领土上的最后一批以色列部队，3月8日下午在落日余辉中乘船离开了西奈半岛南端濒临亚喀巴湾的沙姆沙伊赫。联合国紧急部队的芬兰部队随后接管了侵略者最后撤退的这块埃及领土。
    除为了协助联合国紧急部队建立对沙姆沙伊赫的控制而留下来的十二名以色列技术人员之外，沙姆沙伊赫和亚喀巴湾中的蒂朗岛上已经完全没有以色列军队。
    至此，四个月前对埃及人民发动侵略战争的英、法、以三国军队已经完全被赶出了埃及的领土，以色列军队被迫退到1949年停战线后面去。
