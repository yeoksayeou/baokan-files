    Yunlian County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Profiteering in Livestock Trading

    The Yunlian County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Sichuan Province is making exorbitant profits in the business of draft cattle by buying them at low prices and selling them at high prices. At the end of last year and the beginning of this year, the Yibin County Supply and Marketing Cooperative bought eight head of draft cattle from the Yunlian County Supply and Marketing Cooperative. The Yunlian County Supply and Marketing Cooperative bought these eight head of cattle for 440 yuan. After feeding them for only a few days, they sold them for 697 yuan, making a total profit of more than 200 yuan. It is said that they once sold a cow bought for 60 yuan to the Yongan Grain Station in Fushun County at a high price of 120 yuan.

    Why does the Yunlian County Supply and Marketing Cooperative earn a profit equivalent to 50% or even 100% of the purchase price in the process of reselling? It is said that this is because they lost money in the operation of draft animals in 1955, so now they want to earn some money to "make up for it."

    I think the Yunlian County Supply and Marketing Cooperative's approach is wrong. If they lost money in the past, they should seriously examine and improve, and should not use the method of profiteering to cover up. Gu Chengzhang

### 筠连县供销社在耕畜交易中牟取暴利

    筠连县供销社在耕畜交易中牟取暴利
    四川省筠连县供销社在经营耕牛中，以低价买进、高价卖出的办法，牟取暴利。在去年年底和今年年初，宜宾县供销社先后向筠连县供销社买了八头耕牛。这八头耕牛，筠连县供销社是用四百四十元买进的，他们只喂养了几天，就卖了六百九十七元，一共赚了二百多元。据说，他们还曾经把一头用六十元买进的牛，以一百二十元的高价卖给了富顺县永安粮站。
    为什么筠连县供销社在转手之间就要赚取相当于收购价格50％甚至百分之百的利润呢？据说是因为他们在1955年经营耕畜的时候赔了本，所以现在要赚一些钱来“弥补。”
    我认为筠连县供销社这种作法是不对的。他们过去赔了钱，应该认真检查和改进，而不应该用牟取暴利的办法来掩饰。　顾成璋
