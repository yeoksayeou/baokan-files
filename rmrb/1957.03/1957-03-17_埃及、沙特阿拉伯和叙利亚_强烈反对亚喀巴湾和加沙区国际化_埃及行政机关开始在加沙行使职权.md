Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 16th: "Al-Ahram" reported on the 15th that Egypt and Saudi Arabia will strongly oppose the Western countries' attempts to internationalize the Strait of Tiran at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba.

	Egypt will resolutely exercise its power to control territorial waters. The King of Saudi Arabia has written to President Eisenhower saying that he will do everything possible to thwart attempts to internationalize the Strait of Tiran.

	Saudi Arabian Prime Minister Faisal said that his country would never accept any compromise on this matter under any circumstances and would never give up its rights to its territorial waters in the Strait of Tiran.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 16th: According to a Jeddah dispatch from the Middle East News Agency, a Saudi Arabian government spokesperson stated on March 15th that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will never allow Israel to acquire any rights in the Gulf of Aqaba.

	The spokesperson said that for more than thirteen centuries, the Gulf of Aqaba has been and still is the natural passage for Muslim pilgrims going to the Islamic holy sites. It is the key route to Mecca and Medina. Geographically, the Gulf of Aqaba is a closed Arab gulf, and its territorial waters are under the sovereign jurisdiction of the Arab countries located along the coast of the gulf.

	The spokesperson emphasized that Saudi Arabia will never compromise on protecting the Islamic holy sites and pilgrimage facilities and will take all measures to defend its legitimate historical rights in the gulf and protect the security of its territory and territorial waters.

	The spokesperson said that Saudi Arabia has notified the U.S. government of its position on the Gulf of Aqaba issue.

Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: TASS, Damascus, March 15th: Syrian Minister of State and Acting Minister of Defense Khaled al-Azem told reporters when talking about Western countries' attempts to internationalize the Gaza Strip: "The Gaza Strip is an inseparable part of the Arab nation. The Arabs firmly advocate the return of this region to Egypt. All attempts to internationalize this region will fail because the Arabs will not allow it."

	Al-Azem said when talking about the mission of the United Nations Emergency Force: "The international force should hand over the administration of the Gaza Strip to the Egyptian authorities and should be stationed on the armistice line after completing its mission."

Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: Cairo News: The Egyptian administrative governor in the Gaza Strip, Latif, said on March 15th that since he arrived in Gaza on the evening of March 14th, the Egyptian administrative organs have begun to exercise their authority in Gaza. He pointed out that the role of the United Nations Emergency Force is to "enter the armistice line between Egypt and Israel at the appropriate time." Latif made these remarks when speaking to a United Press International reporter.

	In a statement issued on March 15th, Latif asked residents to cooperate with him and "provide all assistance to the international forces to help them complete their mission of eliminating tensions on the armistice line."

	According to Cairo Radio, United Nations Emergency Force Commander Burns and United Nations Under-Secretary-General Bunche paid a visit to Latif on March 15th.

	Burns and Bunche also held talks with Egyptian liaison officer Helmy in Gaza on March 15th. Helmy told reporters after the talks that they discussed the new status of the United Nations Emergency Force in Gaza after Egypt took over the administrative work in Gaza. He said: "We have reached a consensus in principle on this new status." Helmy said that the two sides also agreed in principle that Egypt would take over the government building currently used by the United Nations Emergency Force headquarters.

Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: According to a Tanjug dispatch from Belgrade, Yugoslavia: A spokesperson for the Yugoslav State Secretariat for Foreign Affairs said at a regular press conference on the 15th that the Yugoslav government believes that Egypt has full rights to establish administrative management in the Gaza Strip in accordance with the 1949 armistice agreement and United Nations resolutions.

Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: Ottawa News: Canadian Minister of External Affairs Pearson said in a parliamentary debate on the Middle East issue on the 15th: No country has legitimate sovereignty over Gaza. Egypt should agree to the United Nations' administrative control over the Gaza Strip until the fate of that region is decided. Pearson also mentioned the "four-nation proposal" regarding the Suez Canal that United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld will discuss when he goes to Cairo (this proposal stipulates that half of the canal tolls will be given to Egypt, and the other half will be frozen by the World Bank). He believes that this proposal provides "a basis for a reasonable solution," and he hopes to reach an agreement soon.

Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: Washington News: U.S. State Department spokesperson White told reporters that the State Department summoned diplomatic representatives from Britain, France, Norway, Italy, the Netherlands, and Austria on the 15th to discuss the recent world situation. He said, "This is a global meeting. I think the Middle East situation, especially the Suez issue, will be discussed."

    埃及将坚决行使它的控制领水的权力。沙特国王已经写信给艾森豪威尔总统说，他将尽一切力量来粉碎使蒂朗海峡国际化的尝试。

    这位发言人说，亚喀巴湾过去有十三个世纪以上的时间一直是，而且现在仍然是到伊斯兰圣地去朝圣的穆斯林朝圣队伍的天然通路。它是到麦加和麦地那去的要害。从地理上看，亚喀巴湾是一个封闭的阿拉伯海湾，而且它是属于位于这个海湾沿岸的阿拉伯国家主权管辖的领海。
    发言人强调，沙特阿拉伯在保护伊斯兰圣地和朝圣设备方面绝不妥协，它将采取一切措施保卫它在这个海湾的历来就有的合法的权利，并且保护它的领土和领海的安全。

    阿泽姆在谈到联合国紧急部队的任务时说：“国际部队应当把加沙地区的管理权交给埃及当局，并且应当在自己的任务完成以后驻扎在停战线上”。
    据新华社16日讯　开罗消息：埃及在加沙地带的行政长官拉蒂夫3月15日说，从3月14日晚上他到达加沙以来，埃及行政机关就开始在加沙行使职权。他指出，联合国紧急部队的作用是在“适当的时候进驻埃及和以色列之间的停战线沿线”。拉蒂夫是在对合众社记者谈话时说这番话的。
    拉蒂夫在3月15日发表的一篇声明中要求居民同他合作，“向国际部队提供一切援助以帮助他们完成消除停战线上的紧张局势的任务”。
    据开罗电台广播，联合国紧急部队司令伯恩斯和联合国副秘书长本奇在3月15日拜会了拉蒂夫。
    伯恩斯和本奇3月15日还在加沙同埃及联络官赫勒米举行了会谈。赫勒米在会谈后对新闻记者说，他们讨论了在埃及接管了加沙的行政工作以后联合国紧急部队在加沙的新地位。他说：“我们在原则上就这种新地位取得了一致意见。”赫勒米说，双方还在原则上同意，埃及将接管现在由联合国紧急部队总部使用的政府大厦。

    新华社16日讯　渥太华消息：加拿大外交部长皮尔逊15日在议会辩论中东问题时说：任何国家对加沙都没有合法的主权，埃及应当同意联合国对加沙地带的行政控制权，直到那个地区的命运决定时为止。皮尔逊还提到联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德前往开罗时将要讨论的关于苏伊士运河的“四国建议”（这个建议规定把运河通行费一半交给埃及，另一半由世界银行冻结），他认为这个建议为“合理解决提供了一个基础”，他希望不久取得协议。
