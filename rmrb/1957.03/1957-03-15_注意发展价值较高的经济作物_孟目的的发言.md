Pay Attention to Developing Economic Crops with High Value
Meng Mu's Speech

In Premier Zhou's report on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, he gave the following instructions regarding agricultural development: "...For products that are urgently needed by society, especially those with significant economic value, such as subtropical and tropical crops, and various agricultural and sideline products needed for export, in addition to unified operation by the state or local authorities, cooperatives should also be encouraged to operate with technical guidance from the state. ..." This has already briefly explained the important significance and specific measures for developing agricultural economic crops. I think the relevant agricultural leadership departments have already paid attention to this issue and made appropriate arrangements.

Based on the climate and soil conditions in China's subtropical regions, it is an important part of vigorously developing agriculture at present to increase the cultivation of various economic crops with higher economic value in a planned and step-by-step manner to meet domestic and export needs. Let's just cite a few plants with high economic value in subtropical or tropical regions:

Quinine Tree: It is a well-known medicinal plant urgently needed both domestically and internationally, and has been controlled and monopolized by the Netherlands in the past and present. Quinine can grow in Yunnan, Hainan Island and other places in China. Although it is currently planted, the quantity is too small, far from meeting domestic and export needs.

Olive Tree: It has a high oil content and grows easily in the Jiangnan area of China. It can green barren mountains and its lifespan can reach more than a thousand years. It is also a valuable timber.

Manna Sage: A sugar-producing plant suitable for growing in Jiangnan, it grows up to 2.5 meters tall and produces sugar throughout its entire body for up to twenty years.

Other medicinal plants and aromatic plants can also be cultivated and planted in China to supply the needs of pharmaceutical and flavoring aspects.

The above are just a few examples. Of course, there are many other economic crops with high economic value that are suitable for cultivation and growth in southern China. There are many varieties that cannot be listed one by one, and it is necessary for our agricultural experts and botanical experts to research and select them and make detailed breeding plans. As long as we pay attention to this issue and take effective measures to gradually develop, we will definitely achieve practical results after several years.

Many plants with high economic value that are unique to a certain region are controlled and monopolized by various countries, and the export of excellent varieties is strictly prohibited. Many special products of capitalist countries are even more difficult to obtain. Therefore, it must be handled by the government in a unified manner. Otherwise, it is impossible to obtain excellent seeds or seedlings.

Finally, I would like to illustrate one fact: since the upsurge of greening the motherland last year, various places have been closing mountains for afforestation and planting trees. However, people in various places have only paid attention to the issue of greening and have planted trees indiscriminately, neglecting the economic value of the plants. As a result, many barren mountains have been completely planted with locust trees, willows and other shrubs, greatly reducing their economic value. This should be corrected. We should make appropriate arrangements based on different soil, climate and moisture conditions. Actively develop the planting and cultivation of subtropical economic crops, combining greening with economic crops, so that agricultural economy can be more widely developed. It is hoped that the relevant agricultural leadership departments will vigorously promote this, provide excellent varieties, conduct technical guidance, and provide necessary demonstrations to set a good example for cooperative farmers and arouse farmers' confidence in developing economic crops from practical benefits. In this way, it will be widely promoted. (Attached picture)

### 注意发展价值较高的经济作物  孟目的的发言

    注意发展价值较高的经济作物
    孟目的的发言
    周总理在发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议报告中对农业的发展曾作过这样的指示：“……凡是社会迫切需要、特别是有重大经济价值的产品，例如亚热带作物和热带作物、出口需要的各种农产品和副产品，除由国家或者地方统一经营以外，还应该鼓励合作社经营，由国家进行技术指导。……”。这里已经扼要说明了发展农业经济作物的重要意义和具体的措施。我想有关农业领导部门对于这一问题已经加以重视，作出了适当的安排。
    根据我国亚热带地区的气候、土壤等情况，有计划、有步骤地增加培植经济价值较高的各种农作物，以应国内和出口的需要，是目前大力发展农业的一个重要环节。我们随便举几个亚热带或热带地区经济价值较高的植物：
    奎宁树：它是人所共知而又为国内外迫切需要的药用植物，过去和现在都为荷兰所统制垄断。奎宁在我国的云南、海南岛等地均可生长，目前虽有种植，但因数量太少，远不及国内和出口的需要。
    洋橄榄树（Olive）：它的含油成份很高，在我国江南一带极易生长，可以绿化荒山，其寿命可达千余年之久，又为有价值的木材。
    甘露蜜树（MannaSage）：为产糖植物，适于江南生长，高达二·五公尺，全身产糖可达二十年。
    其他如药用植物和芳香植物，均可在我国栽培种植，供应制药及调味方面的需要。
    以上所举不过是几个例子，当然还有许多经济价值较高而又适于我国南方地区栽培生长的经济作物，品种甚多不便一一举出，须待我国农业专家、植物专家们的研究选择，做出详细的繁殖计划。只要我们重视这个问题，采取有效措施，逐步发展，若干年后，一定会获得实际的效果。
    许多经济价值较高而又为某一地区所特产的植物，各国都在统制垄断，严加禁止优良品种的出口。资本主义国家的许多特产品种，那更是不易得到。因此，必须由政府统筹办理。否则，得不到优良的籽种或种苗。
    最后，我想说明一件事实：自去年掀起绿化祖国的热潮后，各地都在封山育林，栽培树木，但是各地人民只注意到绿化问题，竟毫不选择的造林种树，忽略了植物的经济价值，因而许多荒山上完全栽种了槐树、杨柳及其他灌木之类，经济价值，大大减低。这是应当纠正的。我们应当分别不同的土壤、气候、以及水分等条件予以恰当的安排。积极发展亚热带经济作物的种植栽培，使绿化与经济作物相结合，俾农业经济得到更广泛的发展。希望有关农业的领导部门大力提倡，供应优良品种，进行技术指导，并做必要的示范，给合作社的农民做出良好榜样，从实际的收益中引起农民的发展经济作物的信心。这样，才会普遍推广。（附图片）
