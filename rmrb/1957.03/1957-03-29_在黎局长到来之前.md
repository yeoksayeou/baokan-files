　　Before Director Li Arrived

　　At the end of last October, Secretary Yu of the Dalian Railway Bureau heard that Director Li was about to take office, and he busied himself preparing housing for the new director. Secretary Yu took a fancy to room number seventy-two in the Nanshan Building. He thought this room was beautiful, the air was fresh, and it was close to work, suitable for the director to live in. However, four families already lived in number seventy-two. What to do? Secretary Yu, under the pretext of "urgent need," wanted to make it a "cadre guest house" and got these four families to move out.

　　In Secretary Yu's opinion, it wouldn't do for the director to move into number seventy-two in its original state. Therefore, he spent more than 200 yuan to repaint the recently painted house again: the floor was painted red, the window frames were painted green, and the ceiling and wainscoting were all repainted. He instructed his subordinates to prepare sofas, double beds, wardrobes, round and square tables and chairs, etc., telling them "don't be afraid to do anything after reading 'Before the New Director Arrived'." He even personally ran all over the three real estate sections of the Dalian area and used a large truck to haul thirteen pieces of furniture such as sofas; he also took away the small round table used collectively by the staff.

　　May we ask Secretary Yu, why such concern for the director, and such lack of concern for the masses?

### 在黎局长到来之前

　  在黎局长到来之前
    去年10月底，大连铁路分局于秘书听说黎局长要到任了，就忙天煞地给新局长准备住房。于秘书看中了南山小楼七十二号房间，他认为这个房间漂亮，空气新鲜，上班近，适合局长住。但是，七十二号已经住着四家人，怎么办呢？于秘书借着“有急用”，要做“干部招待所”。把这四家人弄走了。
    在于秘书看来，光七十二号原样子叫局长搬进来住，还不成话。于是，又花了二百多元把粉刷不久的屋子再粉刷过：地板涂上红油，窗户框涂上绿油，天棚、墙围都给重新刷过。他指示他的下级准备沙发、双人床、大衣柜、圆方桌椅等，要他们“不要看了‘新局长到来之前’，就什么都不敢干了”。自己还亲自动手，跑遍了大连地区三个房产分段，用大卡车拉了沙发等十三件家具；把职工集体使用的小圆桌，也给拉走了。
    请问于秘书，为什么这样的关心局长，而又那样的不关心群众呢？
