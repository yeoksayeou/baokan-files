    Assistant to Court Adjudication Work
    More Than 200,000 People's Assessors Nationwide
    (Our newspaper dispatch) According to statistics from the Ministry of Justice: Last year, more than 200,000 People's Assessors were elected across the country. They are a powerful assistant to the court's adjudication work and a huge legal publicity force.
    During their term as assessors, People's Assessors have the same rights as judges. They can participate in all court proceedings and, in conjunction with interrogation, investigation, and pronouncements, educate the parties involved on policies and laws. They use opportunities such as reporting their work to voters and daily contact with the masses, combined with specific cases, to explain national policies and laws to the surrounding masses, enabling the people to specifically understand the work of the People's Courts and the People's Assessors; prevent crime, reduce disputes, promote internal unity among the people, and consolidate social order.
    Because they are often with the masses, they have a specific and in-depth understanding of the thoughts, feelings, and demands of the masses. Therefore, they can conduct propaganda targeted at the masses' ideological situation. In Guangou Township, Fuzhou City, Jiangxi, a woman had a very good relationship with her husband, but she wanted a divorce because of her mother's instigation. After People's Assessor Yang Chouhong explained the spirit of the Marriage Law to her, she abandoned the idea of divorce. Last year, three disputes in the local area were resolved, and the parties ended their dispute and made peace after he publicized the law. Such examples are countless throughout the country.
    At present, most People's Assessors have a relatively low level of education and do not know much about national policies and laws. With the help and guidance of the People's Courts in various places, they use the spare time from mass work or production to conduct regular legal publicity and education to the masses in a flexible form that is pleasing to the masses.

    法院审判工作的助手
    全国有二十多万陪审员
    本报讯  据司法部统计：去年全国各地共选出了人民陪审员二十多万人。他们是法院审判工作的有力助手，也是一支巨大的法律宣传队伍。
    人民陪审员在陪审期间和审判员有同等权利，可以参加法院的全部诉讼活动，并结合审讯调查和宣判，向当事人进行政策、法律的教育。他们利用向选民汇报工作情况及日常同群众接触的时机，结合具体案例，向周围群众讲解国家的政策、法令，使人民群众具体地了解人民法院和人民陪审员的工作；预防犯罪，减少纠纷，促进人民内部团结，巩固社会秩序。
    由于他们经常和群众在一起，对群众的思想感情和要求了解得具体、深入，因此他们能针对群众思想情况进行宣传。江西抚州市官沟乡有个妇女和她丈夫感情本来很好，但因受她母亲挑唆，想离婚。人民陪审员杨绸红向她讲解了婚姻法的精神以后，她放弃了离婚的念头。去年当地就有三起纠纷经过他宣传法律以后，当事人双方平息了争执，言归于好。像这样的事例在全国各地是不胜枚举的。
    目前，大部分人民陪审员文化水平较低，对国家的政策、法律懂得不多。他们在各地人民法院多方面的帮助与指导下，利用群众工作或生产的空闲时间，采取灵活的为群众喜好的形式，向群众进行经常的法律宣传教育。
