Vigorously Supply Contraceptives and Devices
　　Jin Wu
　　Using contraception to achieve planned childbirth is a common and urgent requirement of married men and women today. However, there are still some problems in the supply of contraceptives and devices. For example, the supply is not widespread, the variety is incomplete, the supply is insufficient, and they are often out of stock. In terms of business methods, they only sell and do not take responsibility for guiding usage; in some cases, male salespersons sell to female customers, which female customers find inconvenient. As for the poor quality of medicines and devices, the masses also have many complaints. The lack of enthusiasm in managing contraceptives and devices stems from the supply departments' insufficient understanding of the people's urgent need for birth control, so they take a "so what" attitude, or even fear "trouble," "fuss," or "shabbiness," or fear that stocking too much will lead to stockpiling and spoilage. This seriously affects market supply.
　　Employees of supply departments should realize that contraception is not just a personal issue, but a social issue, so they must vigorously do this work well. First of all, it is necessary to achieve universal supply and convenient purchase. At present, it is not enough to rely solely on the retail stores of state-owned pharmaceutical companies to operate this commodity. Department stores and grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in various places need to universally sell them; medical or health units of hygiene departments, medical clinics of factories, enterprises, agencies, and people's organizations, county health centers, rural midwife stations, maternal and child health stations, joint clinics, etc. can all be sales agents. Sales by medical and health units can also facilitate guidance on usage methods.
　　Because most women in our country still have feudal ideas to varying degrees, especially in rural areas, female salespersons should generally supply female customers, and male salespersons should supply male customers; supply units that can do so may set up separate counters for supplying contraceptive drugs and appliances. At the same time, some salespersons should be given appropriate training so that they understand general scientific knowledge and hygiene common sense related to contraception, so as to explain to the masses how to use and store contraceptive medicines and devices.
　　The quality of contraceptive drugs and appliances mainly depends on the industrial departments, but commercial departments also have the responsibility to urge production departments to continuously improve quality and strengthen acceptance work to prevent products of poor quality from entering the market.

### 大力供应避孕药械

　　大力供应避孕药械
　　靳吾
    用避孕的方法，达到有计划的生育，是目前已婚男女普遍的迫切要求。但是，在避孕药械的供应工作上却还存在着一些问题。例如供应面不广，品种不全，供应量不充足，经常脱销。在经营方法上，只管出售而不负责指导使用；有的是男营业员出售，女顾客感到不便。至于药械质量不好，群众也很有意见。经营避孕药械不积极的思想，在于供应部门对人民节育的迫切要求认识不足，因此抱着“无所谓”的态度，甚至怕“麻烦”、“费事”、“寒伧”，或怕进货多了造成积压、变质。这样就严重地影响了市场供应。
    供应部门的职工应该认识到，避孕不只是个人的问题，而是一个社会问题，因此要大力做好这项工作。首先要做到供应普遍，购买方便。目前光依靠国营医药公司的零售商店经营这项商品是不够的，需要各地百货公司、基层供销社普遍地经销；卫生部门的妇幼医疗或保健单位，工厂、企业、机关、人民团体的医务所，县卫生院，农村接生站、妇幼保健站、联合诊所等都可以代销。医疗和保健单位代销，还能便于在使用方法上进行指导。
    由于目前我国大部分妇女还程度不同地存在着封建思想，特别是在农村。所以一般应由女营业员供应女顾客，男营业员供应男顾客；条件可能办到的供应单位，可设立单独的供应避孕药品、用具的专柜。同时，对一些营业员应进行适当的训练，使她（他）们懂得有关避孕的一般科学知识和卫生常识，以便对群众说明使用和保管避孕药械的方法。
    避孕药品和用具质量的好坏，主要决定于工业部门，但商业部门也有责任促使生产部门不断提高质量，并加强验收工作，防止质量不好的产品流入市场。
