    Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture
    Building First Li Language School

    (This report) This newspaper reports that the first Li language school in Hainan is currently under construction in Tongshi Town, the capital of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. The school is scheduled to be completed before July of this year, and will begin enrolling students in July. The enrollment targets are mainly cadres from counties, districts, and townships, as well as members of agricultural producers' cooperatives. After graduation, they will be responsible for promoting the Li language.

    There are more than 350,000 Li people on Hainan Island. In the past, due to the lack of their own written language, their economic and cultural development was restricted. With the strong support of the Party Committee and the active assistance of the Hainan branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Minority Languages Survey Team, they began to create their own written language in February of this year.

    海南黎族苗族自治州
    兴建第一所黎文学校
    本报讯　海南第一所黎文学校，现正在海南黎族苗族自治州首府通什镇动工兴建。这所学校计划在本年7月前建成，7月起开始招生。招生对象主要是县、区、乡的干部以及农业生产合作社的社员，他们毕业后将负责黎文推行工作。
    海南岛有三十五万多黎族人民，过去由于没有本民族的文字，在经济、文化建设方面，都受到限制。他们得到党委的大力支持和中国科学院少数民族语言调查工作队海南分队的积极协助，才在今年2月间开始创制了自己的文字。
