Xinhua News Agency, March 1st: The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League held a youth workers conference from February 19th to March 1st. The conference called on youth league organizations across the country to widely mobilize young workers to actively participate in this year's production increase and conservation movement.

The meeting held that in past production increase and conservation movements, the vast number of young workers have played an active role, increasing production and saving a large amount of wealth for the country. Last year, young workers in various regions saved 5,700 tons of steel, more than 18,140 tons of cement, and recovered more than 24,400 tons of scrap steel within three months. Youth league organizations have also accumulated a lot of experience in mobilizing young people to participate in the production increase and conservation movement. Therefore, this year, youth league organizations at all levels must mobilize young people to participate in the production increase and conservation movement more widely and deeply on the basis of the past, and strive to make greater achievements this year.

The meeting discussed how youth league organizations should mobilize young people to participate in the production increase and conservation movement in the future. Everyone agreed that youth league organizations at all levels should first carry out political and ideological education for young workers, especially strengthening class education and labor education, so that they can fully understand the importance of building the country through diligence and thrift and increasing production and practicing economy, thereby inspiring them to consciously raise their socialist consciousness and participate in the production increase and conservation movement with the attitude of masters of the working class. Secondly, youth league organizations at all levels should strengthen technical education for young workers, and must cooperate with administration and trade unions to promote advanced experience and carry out various effective technical learning activities to help young people conscientiously master new technologies so that they can better play a role in the production increase and conservation movement. At the same time, youth league organizations at all levels must, according to the specific conditions of each region, carry out various independent production activities suitable for the characteristics of young people in the production increase and conservation movement. Activities such as youth teams, shock brigades, and supervision posts that have been effectively carried out in the past should be affirmed, but experience should be summarized so that they can be applied realistically according to future production needs. The meeting also emphasized the need to strengthen the work of young technicians and further exert their role in the production increase and conservation movement.

The meeting also discussed the issue of the Communist Youth League strengthening the work of new workers. The meeting held that cultivating and training new workers is a very important task, which is not only related to the development of socialist construction but also related to the growth of the working class. At the same time, young workers account for more than 80% of new workers, so the youth league organization must regard cultivating and training new workers as its regular and important work. Youth league organizations at all levels must first strengthen political and ideological education for new workers, and at the same time must earnestly help new workers quickly master technology, care about their lives, cultural entertainment, and sports activities, and earnestly help them solve some specific difficulties, so that they can work and study with vigor.

The meeting also decided to commend a group of outstanding young people and youth collectives from various regions in the near future who have made significant achievements in saving steel bars, wood, and cement in 1956.

    青年团中央召开青年工人工作会议
    发动青年工人参加增产节约运动
    新华社1日讯  青年团中央委员会在2月19日到3月1日举行青年工人工作会议。会上号召全国各地青年团组织广泛动员青年职工积极参加今年的增产节约运动。
    会议认为，在过去的历次增产节约运动中，广大青年职工都发挥了积极的作用，为国家增产和节约了大量财富。去年各地青年职工在三个月内就节约了钢材五千七百吨，水泥一万八千一百四十多吨，还回收了二万四千四百多吨废钢铁。青年团组织在发动青年参加增产节约运动方面也积累了不少经验。因此，今年各级团组织必须在过去的基础上更广泛深入地发动青年参加增产节约运动，争取在今年内作出更大的成绩。
    会议就今后团组织如何动员青年参加增产节约运动的问题进行了讨论。大家认为，各级团组织今后首先应该向青年职工进行政治思想教育，特别是要加强阶级教育和劳动教育，使他们充分理解勤俭建国和增产节约的重要意义，从而启发他们自觉地提高社会主义觉悟，以工人阶级的主人翁的态度，参加增产节约运动。其次各级团组织应该加强对青年工人的技术教育，必须配合行政、工会推广先进经验，开展各种有效的技术学习活动，帮助青年认真地掌握新技术，使他们能更好地在增产节约运动中发挥作用。同时各级团组织还必须根据各地具体情况，在增产节约运动中开展各种适合青年特点的生产上的独立活动。对于过去开展的有成效的青年班组、突击队、监督岗等活动应该加以肯定，但要总结经验以便根据今后生产需要实事求是地加以运用。会议还强调了要加强青年技术人员的工作，进一步发挥他们在增产节约运动中的作用。
    会议还讨论了关于青年团加强新工人工作的问题。会议认为培养和训练新工人是一件十分重要的工作，它不仅关系到社会主义建设的发展而且关系到工人阶级的成长，同时新工人中青年工人占80％以上，团组织就必须把培养和训练新工人当作自己经常的和重要的工作。各级团组织必须首先加强对新工人进行政治思想教育，同时还必须认真帮助新工人迅速掌握技术，关心他们的生活、文化娱乐和体育活动，切实地帮助他们解决一些具体困难，使他们能够朝气勃勃地进行工作和学习。
    会上还决定在最近表扬一批各地在1956年在节约钢筋、木材、水泥等方面有显著成绩的优秀青年和青年集体。
