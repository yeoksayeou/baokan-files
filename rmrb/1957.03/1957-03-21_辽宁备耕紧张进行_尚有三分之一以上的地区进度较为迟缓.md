    Liaoning Prepares for Spring Planting Intensively
    Over One-Third of Areas Still Lagging Behind
    (Our reporter Lu Hao reports) The biggest snowfall in ten years still covers the land in Liaoning Province, but intensive spring planting preparations have already begun in many parts of the province.
    The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee have dispatched more than 300 cadres to rural areas to assist in spring planting. To strengthen leadership over spring plowing, the leadership organs of Liaoyang County have moved to the countryside. In the relatively mild southern suburbs, the number of people harrowing land to conserve moisture is gradually increasing. In Jin County, near Lüda, many agricultural cooperatives began harrowing land in early March. The western region is busy transporting manure to the fields. According to statistics from fifteen counties, 35% of manure has already been delivered to the fields. Due to an early start this year, twenty-one agricultural tractor stations in Suizhong and other places can complete tractor maintenance work ten days to half a month ahead of schedule. The Liaoning Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and various factories are preparing more than 33,000 new farm tools, such as double-furrow plows and seeders, for farmers, which will be shipped to rural areas successively within the month. Three thousand draft horses purchased from Jilin and Heilongjiang have been transported to various agricultural cooperatives. By April, the total number of purchased draft horses will reach more than 7,000. Many places are carrying out seed selection work. Most of the cotton seeds in Gaiping County have been selected, and the purity and germination rate of the seeds are both above 85%, which is an unprecedentedly good phenomenon.
    However, while this scene of intensive spring planting preparation unfolds, the spring planting work in more than one-third of the province is still progressing relatively slowly. In counties like Changtu and Fengcheng, spring planting work has not been carried out effectively. In some places, because last year's production targets were too high, this year's advocacy of "sufficient reliability" has translated into hesitancy in the cooperatives. Although this phenomenon has been repeatedly criticized and corrected by the leading organs, the correction is still slow and incomplete. Some indicators that had already been achieved last year could be slightly increased this year, but because the standard is based on the average annual output, the production plans are being set lower and lower. The Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative in Haicheng County could have increased grain production by 150,000 jin based on this year's conditions, but because of the idea of "rather low than high," they do not plan to increase production. Last year, some places suffered losses because they did not implement certain yield-increasing measures in accordance with local conditions. This year, some people feel that the "old rules" are safer, and they have cancelled all yield-increasing measures that are suitable for the local area. For example, the Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Dapingfang, Chaoyang County, planted 800 mu of corn last year, and although it suffered severe hail damage, it still harvested more than 300 jin per mu; but this year it only plans to plant 17 mu. Because the leadership department is wavering about this year's production plan and has not finalized it for a long time, many agricultural cooperatives' plans for contracting work to production teams and groups have not yet been communicated. Therefore, there is no basis for knowing what to plant on which land, how much is planned to be harvested, how much manure to deliver, and what kind of manure to deliver. Farmers have no place to exert their energy. Some people have a blindly optimistic attitude. They believe that this year's "spring neck" is long, and the solar terms are late, so they feel that "drag on in the first month, make a fuss in the second month, and dawdle into the third month," so there is no need to rush. Therefore, the spring planting work is scattered and lacks energy. Some agricultural cooperatives in Bakashu Township, Kaiyuan County, do not have enough manure, but no one is picking up the animal manure on the ground. According to the Liaoning Provincial Department of Agriculture's agricultural situation report on March 14, only 25% of the manure in Jinxi County has been delivered, and some agricultural cooperatives in Changtu County have not yet started to deliver manure. Many people feel that spring is still far away, and it will be fine to do it slowly. Recently, the weather has suddenly turned warm. Not long ago, the temperature in Liaoning was still below minus 20 degrees Celsius, but these days it seems that spring has suddenly arrived. The ice and snow accumulated over a winter will melt away in no time, and the earth is about to thaw. A serious spring plowing battle is immediately approaching. The great spring sunshine should awaken such people.

### 辽宁备耕紧张进行　尚有三分之一以上的地区进度较为迟缓

　　辽宁备耕紧张进行
　　尚有三分之一以上的地区进度较为迟缓
    本报讯　本报记者陆灏报道：十年来未有的大雪还封盖着辽宁省的土地，但是紧张的备耕工作已经在全省很多地方开始了。
    中共辽宁省委和辽宁省人民委员会抽调了三百多名干部到农村去协助备耕工作。为了加强春耕工作的领导，辽阳县的领导机关搬到乡下去了。在比较温和的南郊地区，耙地保墒的人马逐渐增多起来。旅大附近的金县，从3月初开始，就有不少农业社开始耙地。西部地区正在繁忙送粪上地。据十五个县的统计，现在已有35％的粪肥送到地里。绥中等地二十一个农业拖拉机站，由于今年动手较早，拖拉机的检修工作可以提前十天到半月完成。辽宁省供销社和各工厂为农民们准备的双铧犁、播种机等三万三千多件新农具，将在月内陆续运往农村。从吉林、黑龙江选购的三千匹耕马已运到各农业社。到4月份，选购的耕马总数将达到七千匹以上。很多地方正在进行选种工作。盖平县的棉花种子大部选完，种子的纯度和发芽率都占85％以上，这是历年来没有的好现象。
    但是，与这一片紧张的备耕景象的同时，全省还有三分之一以上的地区，备耕工作还进行得比较迟缓。像昌图、凤城等县，备耕工作还没有很好地进行。有些地方因为去年的生产指标过高，今年提倡“充分可靠”，传到社里，就变成缩手缩脚了。这种现象虽然经过领导机关一再批判纠正，但还改正得很慢，也不彻底。本来有些指标去年已经达到，今年还可以略为提高，但因为要根据常年产量作标准，因而生产计划一个比一个订得低。海城县金星农业社本来根据今年的条件，可以增产十五万斤粮食，因为“宁低勿高”的思想，结果就不打算增产了。去年有些地方因为没有因地制宜地推行某些增产措施吃过一些亏，今年有些人就觉得还是“老皇历”保险，把适合本地的增产措施也一齐取消了。如朝阳县大平房东方红农业社，去年种了八百亩玉米，虽然受到了严重的雹灾，每亩还收了三百多斤；但今年只准备种十七亩。因为领导部门对于今年的生产计划左右摇摆，迟迟不定，这就造成很多农业社包工包产的计划直到现在还没有下达到队和组。因此，哪块地种什么，计划收多少，送多少粪，送什么粪，根本没有底，农民们有劲也没地方使。有些地方人们存在着一种盲目乐观的情绪。他们认为今年“春脖子”长，节气晚，觉得“扯正月，闹二月，离离拉拉到三月”，不必着急。因此，备耕工作稀稀拉拉，没有劲儿。开原县八棵树乡有的农业社粪肥不足，但地上的畜粪却没人拣。据辽宁省农业厅3月14日的农情简报说：锦西县的粪肥只送出了25％，昌图县有的农业社到目前还没有开始送粪，不少人觉得春天还离得很远，慢慢来也赶得上。最近，天气突然转暖，不久之前辽宁的气温还在零下二十几度，这两天春天好像突然来到了，一个冬季积下来的冰雪，用不了多少时间就要融化干净，大地即将解冻，一场严重的春耕斗争已经立刻逼近眼前，大好春光应该使这样的人惊醒了。
