I listened to Chairman Mao's instructions at the Supreme State Conference and Premier Zhou's report at the plenary session of the National Committee of the CPPCC, which gave me a very profound socialist education. I express my heartfelt support and will continue to study diligently, using it as a guide for my actions in work and life in the future. I also listened to the work report of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC given by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, which gave us a clearer direction for the future work of the CPPCC. I express my great satisfaction and support.

I am extremely honored and excited to represent the Luzhou Municipal CPPCC of Sichuan Province to participate in the Third Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Today I will give a brief report on the work of the Luzhou Municipal CPPCC. Our city is a medium-sized city with a population of only over 100,000. The area is small, and the relationship between parties and classes is relatively simple. It is easy to contact people from all walks of life, and it is more direct and faster to collect and reflect the opinions and requirements of the masses. Contacting relevant departments and handling problems can also be done in a timely manner. Therefore, under the leadership of the local Party committee, we can generally contact all relevant parties in a timely manner to discuss, negotiate and deliberate on the central tasks of each period and some major issues in people's political life. Even if there are different opinions on certain issues, it is easy to repeatedly negotiate, explain the reasoning, so that mutual understanding tends to be consistent, and solve problems.

In addition to closely contacting the masses, uniting various parties, classes, and non-party democratic人士 to carry out political consultation work, the focus of the work is on organizing democratic people from all walks of life to study current affairs policies and political theories. The participants include democratic parties, non-party democratic人士, and industrial and commercial, health, literary, ethnic minorities, religious, and middle and upper-class people scattered in society, totaling more than 300 people. Currently, they are studying current affairs policies, and will soon start a study class on the history of the Chinese Communist Party.

Over the past year or so, organizing people from all walks of life to study has been rewarding. Generally, the members who participate in the study have improved their awareness of socialism to varying degrees, and have a unified understanding and expressed love and support for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's wise, correct, and great leadership of the Chinese people's revolution. Combined with their studies, they have seen the great achievements China has made in all aspects over the past seven years and the gradual improvement of their personal lives, which has made them see that every Chinese person has an infinitely bright future. Thus, it has clarified some people's vague understanding of socialism and some wrong ideas. They have initially learned and believed in the truth of Marxism-Leninism. More and more people are voluntarily requesting to study Marxism-Leninism. We have learned from our work that helping democratic people from all walks of life improve their understanding and transform their thinking through political study is one of the main methods.

**Enlighten the Consciousness of Learning**

The progress of learning mainly depends on the learners' consciousness, willingness, and efforts. Generally speaking, most of the people who participate in the study are voluntary, but some of them do not understand the importance of learning enough, so after participating in the study, it becomes a formality, and they are not so serious and enthusiastic. Although we called for voluntary participation at the beginning of the mobilization for learning, after all, a few people expressed their willingness on the surface, but in reality it was another matter, because some of them thought that participating in the CPPCC's study was a kind of political treatment, and it was not honorable not to participate; some of them thought that if they did not participate in political study, people would say that they were backward. Therefore, some people signed up to participate, but in reality they did not come to study, and if they came, they were just perfunctory. This fully shows that these people are not necessarily voluntary in their learning. However, we treat these friends, although we implement the principle of voluntariness without any coercion, we are still working on them, enlightening and mobilizing them, and cultivating their voluntariness. We focused on helping a major Sichuan Opera actor who had never been willing to participate in political study. Through a friend who was close to him, when explaining ancient classical words in the script to him, we emphasized the important significance of political study. When analyzing the characters in the script, what are the upright characters and what are the villains, and the boundaries must be clearly distinguished. To distinguish the boundaries clearly, it is necessary to have a considerable level of political thought. This actor once performed the scene of Chongzhen's collapse in the play "Li Chuang Wang," and played Chongzhen very miserably and sadly, which aroused the sympathy of some audiences and diluted the great significance of Li Zicheng's revolutionary victory in capturing Beijing. Although the artistic performance was successful (mainly because the adaptation of the script had problems), the effect of the performance became a problem. How are the boundaries between the enemy and us divided? If you don't understand it clearly, this is a problem of your own level, a problem of low awareness, and this is a problem of your own lack of political study. After this comrade actor was helped, he greatly changed, and realized that if he did not pay attention to political study, he could not improve his ideological level and ability to identify, so he felt that learning was good for him. This time his real voluntariness was generated. After that, he attended every report or group study. Our experience is that the so-called involuntary people mainly do not understand the great significance of political study enough, so there is no conscious basis. If we do not take a laissez-faire attitude towards them, but take an active approach to help them and cultivate their voluntariness, once they realize the importance of learning and its benefits to themselves, they will eventually change from involuntary to voluntary. Implementing the principle of voluntariness is by no means limited to passively not coercing and allowing laissez-faire. On the contrary, we should actively cultivate their consciousness. With consciousness, there will be true voluntariness.

**Appropriately Carry Out Criticism**

Regarding the issue of appropriately carrying out criticism and self-criticism in learning, we felt helpless for a long time. Among the people from all walks of life who participated in the study, almost all of them were intellectuals from the old society, and generally they could not accept criticism from others. Therefore, the discussion of issues was often without debate and without confrontation. An elderly CPPCC member expressed his opinion during the study. When talking about the materialism and idealism of philosophy, he said that the relationship between materialism and idealism is that materialism is primary and idealism is secondary. Someone objected to him and said, you are wrong, only materialists say that matter is primary and thinking is secondary, or that existence is primary and consciousness is secondary; conversely, idealists say that thinking is primary and matter is secondary, or that consciousness is primary and existence is secondary. Idealism and materialism are fundamentally opposed, how can you say that materialism is primary and idealism is secondary? This old gentleman did not accept it at all and his thinking was very resistant, and he has not participated in the study since then, and the problem has not been solved in his thinking at all. In addition, an old gentleman, also a CPPCC member, was given care by the Party committee who took the initiative to provide a certain amount of living allowance every month because he had financial difficulties, but he was not satisfied and requested to take on a certain job. In fact, because his conditions were not sufficient, he was not agreed to. He was very resistant in his thinking, and felt that he was not being appreciated, so he wrote a letter to the superior leader and complained a lot. Later, we individually studied and negotiated with him, and explained from the front why his request was not agreed to. This is not because the Party does not care about intellectuals, but because your request is not suitable in terms of objective and subjective conditions. If you obliterate the Party's usual concern for you because this point was not agreed to, and you have a resistant emotion, then the monthly living allowance is not requested by you but is actively given by the Party committee, so what does this explain? After this kind of conversation, this old gentleman expressed his satisfaction and realized that his reflection to the superior was unfounded and should not have been done. We also learned that although ideological understanding issues are different, there is only one truth. If we seriously and patiently explain the truth repeatedly, we can finally reach a consensus. Even if we cannot reach a consensus for a while, but if we are sincerely helping and at the same time adopting the method of gentle breeze and drizzle, the result will not greatly hurt the feelings and form a deadlock, and we can still reserve a little room to wait for other opportunities to talk. Therefore, we feel that it is appropriate to carry out criticism on the basis of consciousness and voluntariness. If it is not voluntary, it is better not to criticize. At the same time, the method and technique should be considered from the effect, and we should take care of the other party's level, and we may adopt a variety of methods. Our experience is that for some people who value face very much, it is best not to carry out criticism in a public occasion. When expressing different opinions to him in individual conversations, it is also possible to say it as a suggestion and provide it for reference in a tactful and polite manner. Another more effective method is to give examples of other people's similar mistakes and help him in an indirect way, and he will be more likely to accept it. Doing so will not hurt face and will help others. More importantly, we should follow the truth that Chairman Mao taught us this time at the Supreme State Conference: "We must persuade others with full reason, and dogmatism cannot persuade people," that is the correct criticism, and that is the real way to "cure the disease to save the person, and be kind to others."

The above is my humble experience. Due to my limited level, I am afraid that there are many errors. Please criticize and correct me, comrades! (Attached picture)

　　沪州市政协是怎样组织政治学习的
　　邢世同的发言
    我听了毛主席在最高国务会议上的指示，周总理在政协全国委员会全体会议上的报告，使我受了一次很深刻的社会主义的教育，我表示衷心的拥护，并要继续认真学习，作为今后在工作中、生活中行动的指南。又听取了陈叔通副主席所作的政协常委会的工作报告，使我们对今后政协工作，有了更加明确的方向，表示非常满意和拥护。
    我能够代表四川省沪州市地方政协来参加中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第三次全体会议，感到无比的光荣和兴奋。
    今天我把沪州市政协工作，作一简单的汇报。我市属于中等城市，人口不过十几万人，地方较小，党派关系和阶级关系，都比较简单，对各界人士联系容易，收集和反映群众的意见和要求，亦比较直接和迅速，联系各有关部门和处理问题，亦能作到及时，因此，我们在当地党委的领导下，就各个时期的中心工作与人民政治生活中的一些重大问题，大体都能及时联系各有关方面，通过座谈、协商、讨论，对某些问题，纵然有不同的意见，但是也易做到反复协商，讲清道理，使彼此认识趋于一致，解决问题。
    除了密切联系群众，团结各个党派、各个阶层、和无党派民主人士进行政治协商工作而外，工作重点是摆在组织各界民主人士进行时事政策和政治理论学习，参加学习的人士包括民主党派、无党派民主人士和工商、卫生、文艺、少数民族、宗教及散居在社会上的中、上层人士共三百多人，目前学习时事政策，今后即将开办中共党史学习班。
    一年多以来，通过组织各界人士学习是有收获的，一般参加学习的成员，对社会主义的觉悟，有了不同程度的提高，对共产党和毛主席领导中国人民革命的英明、正确、伟大，有了一致的认识并表现了热爱和拥护。他们结合学习更从祖国七年来在各方面已经取得了伟大的成就和他们个人生活逐步得到改善等情况来看，更使他们看清了每一个中国人民今后都有着无限美好的光辉前途。因而澄清了某些人士对社会主义模糊不清的认识和一些错误思想。初步知道和相信了马克思列宁主义的真理。自愿要求学习马克思列宁主义的人，一天一天地越来越多了。我们从工作中体会到帮助各界民主人士提高认识改造思想，通过政治学习是主要办法之一。
　　启发学习的自觉
    学习获得进步，主要是依靠学习的人的自觉、自愿和努力。一般说来参加学习的人大多数都是出于自愿的，但其中也有少数人对学习的重要性还理解不够，因而参加学习后，流于形式，并不是那么认真和热情的。由于最初动员学习，尽管号召自愿参加，但是毕竟有少数人在表面上表示自愿，实际则是另一回事，因为他们有的人认为参加政协的学习是一种政治待遇，不参加不光荣；有的人认为政治学习都不参加，恐怕人家说自己落后。因此有的人报了名参加，实际上不来学习，来也是出于敷衍应付，这就充分说明这样的人对学习就不一定是自愿的，不过我们对待这类的朋友，尽管是贯彻自愿原则，不加任何拘束勉强，但我们对他们还是在进行工作，启发动员，培养他们的自愿。我们对一位从来不愿参加政治学习的川剧主要演员就着重进行了帮助，通过一个与他相好的朋友同他在给他讲解剧本中古典词句时，着重向他谈及学习政治的重要意义，就分析剧本中的人物性格来说什么是正派人物，什么是反派人物，界限必须要分别清楚，要把界限分得清楚，就必要具有相当的政治思想水平，这个演员曾经演出李闯王一戏中的崇祯崩驾一幕，把崇祯演得非常凄惨悲哀引起了一部分观众的同情，冲淡了李自成攻破北京的革命胜利的重大意义，尽管艺术的表演是成功的（主要是剧本的改编有毛病），但是演出的效果就成了问题。敌我界限是怎样划分的？如果弄不清楚，这就是属于自己的水平问题，觉悟不高的问题，这就是自己的政治学习不够的问题。这位演员同志经过帮助之后，大大地有了转变，认识了不重视政治学习，不能提高自己的思想水平和识别能力，因此，他感到学习对自己是有好处的，这一下他真正的自愿产生了。以后听报告，或小组学习都每次必到。我们的体会，所谓不自愿的人主要是对政治学习的重大意义理解不够，因而没有自觉的基础，如果对他们不采取听任自流而采取积极帮助的办法，进行培养其自愿，一旦他们认识了学习的重要性和对自己的益处，他们终归于会由不自愿转变为自愿的。贯彻自愿原则，决不止于消极地不加勉强，听任自流。相反地应该积极培养其自觉，有了自觉，才会产生真正的自愿。
　　适当地开展批评
    关于在学习中适当地开展批评与自我批评的问题，我们在很久一段时间感到束手无法，在参加学习的各界人士中，差不多都是来自旧社会的知识分子，一般对别人的批评是接受不了的，因而对问题的讨论，经常是没有展开争辩，互不交锋。一个年老的政协委员在学习时发表意见，谈到哲学的唯物唯心时说，唯物论与唯心论的关系，唯物是第一性，唯心是第二性，有人反对他说，你弄错了，只有唯物主义者说，物质是第一性，思维是第二性，或者说存在是第一性，意识是第二性；反之，唯心主义者说，思维是第一性，物质是第二性，或者说，意识是第一性，存在是第二性，唯心唯物根本是对立的，那里能够说，唯物论是第一性，唯心论是第二性呢？这位老先生根本就不接受，思想非常抵触，从此就一直不参加学习了，同时在他的思想上也根本没有解决问题。另外，一位老先生也是一个政协委员，因其生活有困难，党委主动每月给予一定生活补助的照顾，但他不满意，要求要担任某项工作，实际因其条件不够，未予同意，他思想上很抵触，大有怀才不遇之感，于是便向上级首长写信，大发牢骚，后来我们约他个别研究协商，正面讲清为什么没有同意他的道理，这不是党对知识分子不关心，而是因为你的请求，在主客观的条件上，都有不适合的地方，如果因这一点没有同意而抹杀了党平素对你的关怀，反生抵触情绪，那末你每月的生活补助，并非由你的请求而由党委主动发给，这又说明一个什么问题？经这样的谈话后，这位老先生表示满意，认识了他向上级反映是没有什么根据的，也是不应该的。我们又体会到思想认识问题，尽管各有不同，但是真理只有一个，认真耐心地反复把道理说清楚，最后是可以一致的，即是一时不能做到一致，但是出于真心诚意的帮助，同时又是采取和风细雨的方法，结果亦不会大伤感情，形成僵局，还可以保留一点余地，等待其他的机会再谈。因此，我们觉得在自觉自愿的基础上，适当地展开批评是应该的，如果不自愿，宁可不批评，同时在方法上、技术上都要从效果上来考虑，应该照顾到对方的水平，不妨采用多种多样的方法。我们的经验，对某一些面子观点重的人，最好是不要在当众的场合，展开批评，在个别交谈中，表达对他不同的意见时，也不妨委婉客气一点说成是建议，提供参考。还有一个比较行之有效的办法，就是：举出别人同他类似的错误的例子，用间接方式进行帮助，他是会容易接受的。这样做，既不伤面子，又帮助了别人。更重要的应该按照毛主席这一次在最高国务会议上教导我们的：“要以充分的道理来说服别人，教条主义是说服不了人的”这个真理去做，那才是正确的批评，才是真正“治病救人，与人为善”的办法。
    以上是我一点粗浅的体会，限于水平，恐怕错误之点很多，请委员们、同志们批评指正！（附图片）
