Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 9th—Sarwar Hassan, a member of the Pakistani delegation to the United Nations to participate in the Kashmir issue debate, said yesterday at a speech at the Pakistan Institute of International Affairs, when talking about his impression of the Security Council's recent debate on the Kashmir issue, that one of the most important characteristics of the debate was the "moral support" given to Pakistan by the "representative of China (referring to the Taiwan Kuomintang group), the great statesman Dr. Chiang Ting-fu." He also said that this China is not now on the mainland, but although this China does not enjoy its former status, it displays a moral standard.

At this time, a staff member of the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan, who was present at the meeting, stood up and said that there is only one China in the world now, and that is the People's Republic of China. 600 million Chinese people resolutely oppose any attempt or statement aimed at creating so-called "two Chinas." It is deeply regrettable to hear what you just said. After saying these words, the Chinese Embassy personnel withdrew from the meeting in protest.

    巴基斯坦一官员的演说
    有害中巴友谊
    我使馆人员退出会场以示抗议
    新华社卡拉奇9日电　巴基斯坦派赴联合国参加克什米尔问题辩论的代表团团员萨瓦尔·哈桑昨天在巴基斯坦国际问题研究所发表演说谈到他对安全理事会最近辩论克什米尔问题的印象时说，辩论最重要的特点之一是“中国（指台湾国民党集团）代表、伟大的政治家蒋廷黻博士”给予巴基斯坦的“道义上的支持”。他又说，这个中国现在并不在大陆上，尽管这个中国并不享有它以前的地位，它却显示了一种道德标准。
    这时，出席这次会议的中国驻巴基斯坦大使馆的一个人员站起来说，现在世界上只有一个中国，那就是中华人民共和国。六亿中国人民都坚决反对目的在于制造所谓“两个中国”的任何企图和说法。听到你刚才说的话，令人深感遗憾。说了这些话以后，中国大使馆人员就退出了会场以示抗议。
