Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, March 22nd. Agricultural cooperatives in the disaster areas of Hebei Province are mutually exchanging seeds and assisting each other with funds, relying on their own efforts to overcome various difficulties in spring plowing and production, and striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture.

　　Many agricultural cooperatives in the disaster areas of this province felt that they did not have enough seeds or sufficient funds in preparing for plowing. Some cooperative cadres were prepared to rely solely on state assistance to solve the problems. In response to these situations, the local Party committees adopted a series of measures to launch mutual assistance. Baoding, Tianjin and other regions, at the prefectural, county, and township three-level cadre meetings held in March, put forward the slogan "State support is limited, mutual aid is boundless," calling on cooperatives to support each other and tap potential to overcome difficulties through self-reliance. The cooperatives in Qingyuan County carefully calculated the surplus and deficit figures of various seeds based on the planting plan of their own cooperative, and took the initiative to adjust surpluses and shortages. Through the above methods, the county solved the problem of over 330,000 jin of various seeds. According to the understanding of 24 cooperatives in the fourth district of Xiong County, 110,000 jin of various seeds were exchanged, which basically solved the difficulty of insufficient spring sowing seeds.

　　Many counties in Tianjin Prefecture, when raising and borrowing production funds on their own, implemented the spirit of "spending less money, doing big things, increasing production and practicing economy." They launched activities to tap potential to raise production funds. Eighteen disaster-stricken cooperatives in Daxing County solved the difficulty of funds in spring plowing through tapping potential and mobilizing cooperative members to invest, and cancelled the requirement for loans from the state; another 240 cooperatives took the initiative to reduce the number of loans. Jianhua Agricultural Cooperative in Jiudian Township, Feixiang County, originally lacked more than 9,000 yuan in funds. After discussion by the cooperative members, it was decided to solve more than 7,000 yuan by using waste iron to make agricultural tools and peeling cotton firewood bark to weave livestock sets.

　　河北灾区广泛进行互助互济
    新华社保定22日电　河北灾区农业社互相调换籽种、互助资金，自力更生克服春耕生产中的各种困难，争取农业大丰收。
    这个省的灾区有不少农业社在备耕中感到种籽不够，资金不足，有些社干部准备单纯依赖国家帮助解决。针对这些情况，各地党委采取了一系列措施发动互助互济。保定、天津等专区，在3月份召开的专、县、乡三级干部会议上，都提出了“国家支援有限，互助力量无穷”的口号，号召合作社互相支援和挖潜力，自力更生克服困难。清苑县各社根据本社种植计划，认真核算了各种籽种的余缺数字，主动进行了有无调剂。通过上述办法，全县共解决各种籽种三十三万多斤。据雄县四区二十四个社的了解，互换各种籽种十一万斤，基本上解决了春播籽种不足的困难。
    天津专区不少县份，在自筹、互借生产资金时，贯彻了“少花钱，办大事，增产节约”的精神。开展了挖潜力筹措生产资金活动。大兴县十八个受灾社，经过挖潜力和发动社员投资，解决了春耕中的资金困难，取消了向国家的贷款要求；另有二百四十个社主动减少了贷款数字。肥乡县旧店乡建华农业社原来缺少资金九千多元，经社员们讨论以后，决定用废铁自打农具、自剥棉花柴皮编织牲口套等办法，解决了七千多元。
