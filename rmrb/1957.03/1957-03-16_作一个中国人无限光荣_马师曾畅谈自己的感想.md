I express my heartfelt support for Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference expansion meeting, Premier Zhou's report on his visit to eleven countries, and the reports of other leaders!

I am an actor in the Guangdong Cantonese Opera Troupe. I feel that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, it is an infinite honor and gratification to be a citizen of New China. This honor and gratification is not because I am now a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, but because I have personally witnessed the tremendous achievements that China has made under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, both in diplomacy and in domestic affairs.

In the past, China was not valued by others and could never play any role in the world, but was the target of international imperialist aggression. We were bullied for a long time and could not hold our heads high. But now? With the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, China has become strong in a short period of a few years. The Chinese people have stood up, and China has played a great role in international affairs.

In diplomacy, one victory follows another. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have been further developed into the spirit of the Bandung Conference, becoming the common goal of the Asian and African peoples, as well as the goal of all peace-loving people in the world. Recently, our Premier Zhou traveled over 54,000 kilometers in eighty days, visiting eleven countries in Asia and Europe, and achieved unprecedented success. This is not only a source of honor and pride for the Chinese people, but it is also certain that peace-loving countries and people all over the world will share this feeling.

In domestic affairs? Large-scale socialist industrial construction is underway, and agricultural cooperativization, handicraft cooperativization, and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce have been realized. The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend has been implemented in culture and academics, etc., so that the material and cultural life of the people across the country is flourishing.

As an actor on the stage, because I often go to the countryside and factories to perform, I have personally seen that the lives of workers and peasants have improved to varying degrees, full of a new atmosphere. Especially the peasant brothers now, not only live a life of plenty, but also have money to see operas. In the past, some poor and remote areas have now also emerged with many "thousand-jin she" (high-yield agricultural cooperatives) and "thousand-jin xiang" (high-yield townships). Every time we go to the countryside to perform, the theater is full every day, and people queue up to buy tickets, and many people wait in front of the theater door early in the evening to buy tickets for the next day. This also shows that only when the people are well-fed and clothed can they have the ability to pursue cultural and recreational activities. And the cultural and recreational life of the peasants, being able to see operas is a small thing. The main thing is that amateur theater groups have been widely developed in the countryside, and many talents with great potential for development in the theater world have emerged, becoming a reserve army on the theater front. Therefore, from the perspective of an actor in the arts, the social landscape of our motherland has indeed undergone fundamental changes. This change has brought actors and the people together. Actors perform for the people, perform repertoire that the people like to see, perform repertoire that is beneficial to the people, and perform repertoire that can inspire the masses to build a socialist motherland. At the same time, the people will also use the above standards to examine us, supervise us, and educate us.

In the past two years, what I have deeply realized is that I can still make a little progress and contribute a little to the socialist cause, thanks to the leadership of the Party and the encouragement of the people. With leadership, I will not lose my way; with encouragement, I can move forward. I am a plowing ox in the artistic garden, and I am willing to diligently dedicate everything I have to the motherland and the people, and cultivate a flower for the motherland.

Finally, let's also talk about the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. As Premier Zhou said in his report, Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the residents of Taiwan, including all Kuomintang military and political personnel, are Chinese. Liberating Taiwan is China's internal affair, and liberating Taiwan is a problem that China can solve on its own. Taiwan must be liberated. As a Chinese, for the benefit of the motherland and for the benefit of the residents of Taiwan, I hope to liberate Taiwan in a peaceful way. Therefore, I would like to say to friends in the theater and film circles in Hong Kong, Macao, and overseas, everyone can perform meritorious service for the motherland, and should perform meritorious service for the motherland. How to perform meritorious service? As long as you write a letter to your relatives and friends living in Taiwan, expressing the motherland's sympathy and care for them, and expressing your and the people of the motherland's common desire for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and the reunification of the motherland, then you have fulfilled the responsibility of a member of the people to the motherland, and you have made a contribution to the motherland. Of course, performing meritorious service is not limited to writing a letter, and is not limited to this one method. This is just an example, and you can think of many other ways.

That's all I have to say. I wish all leaders, all members, and all comrades good health!

### 作一个中国人无限光荣  马师曾畅谈自己的感想

    作一个中国人无限光荣
    马师曾畅谈自己的感想
    我对于毛主席在最高国务扩大会议上的讲话，周总理访问十一国的报告及其他各位首长的报告，表示衷心拥护！
    我本人是广东省粤剧团的一个演员，我感觉到在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下，作为一个新中国的人民；是无限的光荣和欣慰。这一种光荣和欣慰，并不是因为我本人今天得做了全国人民政治协商会议的委员，而是由于我亲眼看到我们中国在共产党和毛主席领导之下，使得我们中国无论在外交上、内政上，都取得了空前的成就。
    从前，我们中国是不被人家重视的，从来在世界上是起不了什么作用的，而是国际帝国主义侵略的目标。我们长期的被人家欺负抬不起头来。但是现在呢？有了共产党和毛主席的领导，在短短几年之间，我们中国强大起来了。我们中国人民站起来了，我们中国在国际事务上起了很大作用了。
    在外交方面，一个胜利接着一个胜利，和平共处的五项原则进一步发展为万隆会议的精神，成为亚非人民共同奋斗的目标，也为全世界爱好和平的人士的奋斗目标。最近我们周总理在八十天的时间，旅行了五万四千多公里的地方，访问了亚洲和欧洲十一个国家，更取得了空前的成就。这不单是我中国人民感到光荣和骄傲，而且可以肯定的是全世界爱好和平国家和人民也将有此同感。
    在内政方面呢？进行着规模宏大的社会主义工业建设，实现了农业合作化、手工业合作化与资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。在文化学术上贯彻了百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针等等，使得全国人民的物质与文化生活蓬蓬勃勃地向前发展。
    我本人是舞台上的演员，由于我常常下乡、下厂去演出，亲眼看见工人和农民的生活有了不同程度的提高，充满着一片新气象。尤其是现在的农民兄弟，不单过着饱暖的生活，而且有钱看戏了。过去一些穷乡僻壤的地方，现在也出现了很多千斤社、千斤乡了。我们每一次下乡演出，都是天天满座，买票的情况，都是排长龙，还有很多很多人预早在今天的晚上站在剧场门口等候买明天的票。这也可以说明：只有人民能食得饱穿得暖以后，才有能力去追求文娱生活。而农民的文娱生活，能看戏还是小事情，主要的还表现在业余剧团已在农村中普遍发展起来，还涌现出了许多在戏剧界很有发展前途的人材，成为戏剧战线上的一支预备大军。因此，从我一个演员的身份在艺术事业的角度上来看我们的祖国，社会面貌的确已起了根本变化，这个变化已使演员和人民之间打成一片了。演员为人民而演出，要演为人民喜闻乐见的剧目，要演有益于人民的剧目，要演能鼓舞群众情绪建设社会主义祖国的剧目。同时，人民也会拿出上述标准来检查我们、督促我们和教育我们。
    两年来，使我最深切体会到的是，我本人还能有一点进步，对社会主义事业还能作出一点贡献，一是党的领导，一是人民的鞭策，有了领导才不会迷途，有了鞭策，才能前进。我是艺术园地里的一条耕牛，我愿意勤勤恳恳地为祖国、为人民献出我的一切，栽培出一朵祖国的鲜花。
    最后，也谈谈和平解放台湾的问题。正如周总理在报告中所说，台湾是中国的领土，台湾的居民，包括一切国民党军政人员在内，都是中国人。解放台湾是中国的内政，解放台湾是中国自己能够解决的问题，台湾是一定要解放的，作为一个中国人，为了祖国的利益，也为了台湾居民的利益，是希望能用和平方式来解放台湾。因此，我在这里寄语港澳及海外戏剧界、电影界的朋友们，每一个人都可以为祖国立功，都应当为祖国立功。怎样立功呢？只要你向居住在台湾的亲友写一封信，表达祖国对他们的同情与关怀，表达你与祖国人民对和平解放台湾、统一祖国的共同愿望，这就是你对祖国尽了人民一分子的责任，也就是为祖国立下一点功劳。当然，立功并不限于写一封信，并不限于就此一种方式，只是举此为例，其他办法你们会多多去想的。
    我的话完了，祝各位首长、各位委员、各位同志身体健康！
