I fully endorse Chairman Mao's instructions at the Supreme State Conference and Premier Zhou Enlai's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries. I also agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of several issues concerning the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as well as the summary report on the work of short-term training classes for industrialists and businessmen.

Now, I will give a speech on the agricultural cooperativization, agricultural production, and the living conditions of farmers in Sichuan Province, as follows:

First, let's talk about the speed of the advanced form of agricultural cooperativization in our province.

Building Advanced Cooperatives is the Mainstream of Farmers' Thinking, and the Quality of General Agricultural Cooperatives is Good

After Sichuan Province basically achieved the primary form of agricultural cooperativization in the spring of 1956, and after a year of production movement and preparation for transferring to advanced cooperatives, by the end of January this year, more than 120,000 advanced cooperatives had been established, with more than 9.14 million farmer households joining, accounting for nearly 70% of the total number of farmer households (adding primary cooperatives, the total number of farmer households joining the cooperatives reached more than 12.84 million, accounting for 94% of the total number of farmer households). Through last year's large-scale production increase campaign, the province increased grain production by 10%, ensuring increased income for the vast majority of cooperative members. This proves that it was necessary to seize the opportunity to achieve the primary form of agricultural cooperativization last year, which conformed to the wishes of the masses and the requirements of developing production. On this basis, it is entirely possible and necessary to basically achieve the advanced form of agricultural cooperativization this spring, because:

1. According to our investigation in the second half of last year, among the primary cooperatives, except for about 10% of the farmers (mainly wealthy households and households with a lack of labor) who had concerns, the rest of the farmers, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, actively requested to transfer to advanced cooperatives. From 1954 to September 1956, our province had trial-run more than 20,000 advanced cooperatives. Farmers deeply realized from the trial run that advanced cooperatives were superior to primary cooperatives. Because advanced cooperatives eliminated the private ownership of land and other major means of production, and implemented the principle of "each according to his ability, distribution according to his work," they not only ensured better implementation of national policies and plans, but also fundamentally liberated the productive forces. Advanced cooperatives have the conditions to use abundant labor on collectively owned land to build water conservancy projects, carry out land processing, and improve farming techniques. Therefore, advanced cooperatives generally increased production by about 20% in 1956, and some even reached more than 50%, which was a significant increase compared to primary cooperatives; coupled with income from household sideline occupations, it ensured increased income for more than 90% of cooperative members. According to statistics from nine counties including Pixian County, among the seventy-two advanced cooperatives that participated in the 1956 income distribution, there were sixty-eight cooperatives with increased production (twenty with an increase of less than 20%, twenty-seven with 21%-30%, and twenty-one with an increase of more than 31%), and two cooperatives each maintained production and reduced production (mainly due to disasters); among the 26,535 cooperative member households participating in the income distribution, households with reduced income accounted for only 7.5%. The magnitude of increased production and increased income was higher than that of primary cooperatives. These facts were all yearned for by the members of the primary cooperatives, and they all voluntarily requested to transfer to advanced cooperatives. This request has become the mainstream of thinking of the masses in rural areas.

It is also a fact that a few cooperative members are unwilling to transfer to advanced cooperatives or even request to withdraw from the cooperatives. But who are they? According to investigations in Deyang and Jiange Counties, 55% of the upper-middle peasants are unwilling to transfer to advanced cooperatives. They have more land or other commercial income, and they are afraid of reducing income after joining advanced cooperatives; among the lower-middle peasants and poor peasants, 8% are also unwilling to transfer to advanced cooperatives. They also have small-scale commercial or handicraft income, or have less labor force, and are also afraid of reducing income after joining advanced cooperatives. After a large-scale political propaganda campaign during the Spring Festival, the situation of a few cooperative members being unwilling to transfer to advanced cooperatives and withdrawing from the cooperatives has become rare.

2. The quality of agricultural cooperatives in our province is currently good. Judging from the production situation and the leadership ability of the cadres, first-class cooperatives account for 60%, second-class cooperatives account for 30%, and third-class cooperatives account for 10%. The main cadres of advanced cooperatives generally participated in short-term training before transferring to advanced cooperatives, learned the management methods of collective production, and have been practically trained in the cooperative movement in recent years, which laid a good foundation for the transfer to advanced cooperatives. Most cooperatives actively carried out production increase campaigns after summarizing production, inspecting and improving management systems, and formulating future production plans. The labor attendance rate of cooperative members generally increased from about 60% in the winter of last year to more than 80%-90%; comprehensive work on accumulating fertilizer and building water conservancy projects was carried out; and many cooperative members actively invested in the cooperatives. Judging from the current situation, with the basic realization of the advanced form of agricultural cooperativization, a new production upsurge is beginning to arrive. Of course, it is not to say that there are no difficulties in our work. For example, after the abolition of land remuneration, it is not easy to ensure that 90% of the cooperative members increase their income, which requires us to strive for it from all aspects.

The Province Increased Grain Production by More Than 4 Billion Jin Last Year

Secondly, let's talk about the agricultural production and the living conditions of farmers in our province in 1956.

Grain production in our province in 1956 increased by 10% compared with 1955, a net increase of 4.04 billion jin; the cotton planting area was expanded compared with 1955, but the yield per unit area decreased due to disasters, and the total output basically maintained the level of 1955; sugarcane increased by 25.7% compared with 1955. A number of agricultural cooperatives with a yield of 1,000 jin of grain per mu, 10,000 jin of sugarcane, and 100 jin of cotton per mu emerged throughout the province. The reasons for such a large increase in production are: First, agricultural cooperativization has been basically realized. According to statistics from 143,405 cooperatives in twelve special districts, 89.4% of the cooperatives increased production in 1956, 5% maintained the level of 1955, and only 5.6% of the cooperatives reduced production. It is very meaningful to compare the production increase before and after cooperativization. Before cooperativization, 1954 increased by 6.6% compared with 1953 (a net increase of 2.419 billion jin), and 1955 increased by 3.63% compared with 1954 (a net increase of 1.417 billion jin); however, after cooperativization, although there were more natural disasters in 1956, it still increased by 10% compared with 1955 (a net increase of 4.04 billion jin), exceeding the total increase in the previous two years. This proves that agricultural cooperativization is a reliable foundation for increasing production and is the fastest way to increase production at present.

Second, after the completion of the construction of cooperatives, all forces immediately turned to production and immediately grasped the operation and management of the cooperatives. In particular, the implementation of the system of contracting work and output was accelerated, so that the chaotic phenomenon of no one being responsible for production in the initial stage of the establishment of cooperatives was quickly and basically ended. At the same time, from the time the cooperatives turned to production, the work of restoring and developing sideline occupations was seized, some unreasonable restrictions were removed; when formulating production plans, the formulation of financial revenue and expenditure plans was seized, the principle of diligence and thrift in running cooperatives was implemented, and the income distribution plan was studied and formulated, stipulating reasonable standards for various expenses and public retentions, which played an important role in increasing production, increasing income, and consolidating the cooperatives.

Third, on the basis of cooperativization, various advanced production increase measures were promoted and tested. On the basis of criticizing and overcoming conservative thinking, our province promoted double-cropping rice interplanting and intercropping, increased the planting of one season of late autumn crops to increase the multiple cropping area, widely promoted and selected various improved varieties from other places and locally, actively built water conservancy projects and accumulated and produced fertilizer, changed the farming system, and boldly carried out various technical reforms and experiments, found many tricks to increase production, and tapped a large amount of production increase potential.

The multiple cropping index in our province increased from 155% in 1955 to 161.62% in 1956. Among them, the multiple cropping area of ​​grain crops increased by 8.88 million mu (including 4.5 million mu of double-cropping rice and 3 million mu of one season of late autumn crops). The grain increased by 1.776 billion jin due to the increase in the multiple cropping area, accounting for about 44% of the total grain increase in the province. In 1956, Neijiang Special District had 49 agricultural cooperatives with a grain yield of 1,000 jin per mu. Their multiple cropping index was above 19%, and the grain planting area generally increased by about 15%.

The advanced production increase measures promoted in our province in 1956 were all correct in themselves and met the requirements of farmers to develop production; however, when some cooperatives promoted them, the effect was not great or not good, mainly because the teaching and guidance work was not accurate. There were also some places where the leadership style did not implement the mass line, and there was subjectivism. They did not understand the spirit of adapting to local conditions and adapting to the times, so they promoted some things that did not conform to the specific local and current conditions, and got the opposite result, suffered some losses, and aroused dissatisfaction among some people. The summary of the technical promotion work in Neijiang Special District is representative. Among the technologies promoted in this special district, 77% were technically correct and well promoted, 22% were technically correct, but some problems occurred in the promotion process, and only 1% were fundamentally incorrect.

Last Year, the Average Income of the Agricultural Population Increased by More Than 14%

With the development of rural sideline production, the income of farmers has also increased accordingly, and their lives have been improved. The total value of agricultural and sideline products in the province in 1956 increased by 16.6% compared with 1955 (including the increased income from the price increase of agricultural and sideline products), which is almost equivalent to the increased income in the past two years. The average total income of each agricultural population in the province was 85.9 yuan, an increase of 14.5% compared with the average total income of 75 yuan per person in 1955. According to the statistics of income distribution of 143,405 cooperatives in twelve special districts, more than 88% of the cooperative members increased their income, and 83.5% of the cooperatives achieved an income increase of more than 90% of the cooperative members (this statistics does not include the income of cooperative members' household sideline occupations, if it is included, there will be more cooperatives with increased production and cooperative members with increased income). Therefore, the countryside is full of joy, the confidence in running cooperatives is very high, and the enthusiasm for production is very great. Naturally, there are also a few cooperative members who have not increased their income, or whose income has decreased compared with before joining the cooperative, and they are unhappy in their hearts, and their thinking is still somewhat shaken by the cooperative. However, there are many reasons for the decrease in income, and the situation should be analyzed specifically and cannot be generalized. First of all, the cooperatives that reduced production last year all encountered natural disasters that could not be completely overcome, which cannot be avoided in the longer term in the future. Secondly, some cooperatives with reduced production were indeed caused by our lack of experience in our work. For example, in the transfer of cooperatives and the merger of cooperatives, some cooperatives with excessively disparate economic foundations should not be merged together, so that some cooperative members with higher original income reduced their income; after the abolition of land remuneration in some advanced cooperatives, the allocation of cooperative members with less and weaker labor force was improper, so that they did less labor days and reduced their income. These problems have been paid attention to and corrected in the cooperative's final accounts distribution and the rectification work in the winter and spring of this year, and we need to continue to pay attention to them in future work. As for a few wealthy farmers with more land, high yields, and high income, the cooperative is difficult to guarantee that they will all increase their income within one or two years or more after joining the cooperative, which is a fact; but on the basis of developing production, doing a good job, it is possible to strive to increase the income of these households year by year. The facts of some old cooperatives have proved this problem. There are also some shortcomings in the income distribution work. For example, two distributions a year (pre-payment in Xiaochun, final accounts in Dachun) are somewhat concentrated and too long in time, and some farmers (mainly wealthy farmers) have not yet become accustomed to it and feel that money is tight, not as relaxed as when they were working alone. In addition, the distribution work of some cooperatives is rough, ideological education for cooperative members is not meticulous and patient enough, the democratic spirit in the leadership style is poor, and there is not enough consultation with the masses, etc.

These shortcomings are naturally unavoidable due to our lack of experience in such a huge movement, but some of them are caused by our insufficient subjective efforts. The agricultural departments of our province attach great importance to these shortcomings and problems, and are summarizing research and gradually improving them.

The improvement of farmers' lives, in addition to the main reason for the increase in production, is also due to the fact that the income of farmers has increased even more after the state reduced the sales price of industrial products and increased the purchase price of agricultural products. In July 1956, the prices of nearly 300 kinds of industrial products in our province were generally reduced by 3.3%, and the prices of about 50% of agricultural, forestry, and sideline products were increased (including a 6% increase in the purchase price of rice and an 11% increase in the purchase price of live pigs). In this way, farmers throughout the province can increase their income by more than 120 million yuan and reduce their expenditure by more than 25 million yuan due to the reduction in the sales price of industrial products in one year. Averaged over the agricultural population of the province, each person increased their income by 2.3 yuan. From this, it can be seen that the income of farmers has increased, so the lives of farmers have also been improved to varying degrees. First, farmers have more money to save. The amount of farmers' deposits in the province in 1956 increased by 82.82% compared with 1955. Second, the consumption of farmers' living consumer goods has increased. In 1956, each agricultural population consumed an average of 495 jin of grain (integrated by the Statistics Bureau based on the materials of twelve base points), an increase of 5.54% compared with the average consumption of 469 jin of grain per person in 1955. The consumption of other living materials in rural areas increased by 8.5% compared with 1955, and the increase in major daily necessities was the largest. Taking the sales volume of 1955 as 100, cotton cloth increased by 23.8%, knitwear and cotton fabrics increased by 98.34%, and cultural and educational supplies increased by 106.37%. Third, the number of poor households in rural areas has decreased. The number of poor households in the province, which accounted for about 15% of agricultural households in 1955, has been reduced to about 10% after the support of the state and cooperatives. According to the investigation of 467 cooperative members of the Shunjiang Agricultural Cooperative in Neijiang County, poor households accounted for 14% in 1953, decreased by 0.3% in 1954, decreased by another 1.3% in 1955, and decreased by 3.7% after transferring to an advanced cooperative in 1956, and poor households accounted for only 8.7% of the total number of households. Some older cooperatives with faster production development have basically eliminated poor households.

In the past year, the achievements we have made on the agricultural production front are huge, the experiences we have gained are rich, and there are also many useful lessons. We must conscientiously summarize these valuable experiences and lessons, consolidate the achievements we have made, overcome our shortcomings and mistakes, and strive to realize the call of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and Chairman Mao: "Think of all possible ways, do everything possible, and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year."

If there is anything inappropriate in the above speech, please criticize and correct me, fellow committee members and comrades. (Attached picture)

　　四川农民办社信心高生产劲头大
　　李宗林的发言
    我完全拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上的指示和周恩来总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告。并同意李富春副总理关于第二个五年计划建议的若干问题的说明和陈叔通副主席关于中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告及关于工商业者短期讲习班工作的总结报告。     
    现在我就四川省农业合作化、农业生产和农民生活情况，作如下发言：
    首先，谈谈我省高级形式的农业合作化的速度问题。
    办高级社是农民思想主流，一般农业社质量都好
    四川省在1956年春季基本上实现初级形式的农业合作化以后，经过一年的生产运动和转社的准备工作，到今年1月底，共建高级社十二万多个，入社农户有九百一十四万多户，将近占农户总数的70％（加上初级社，入社农户共达到一千二百八十四万多户，占农户总数的94％）。经过去年的大规模的增产运动，全省增产粮食10％，保证了绝大多数社员增加收入，这就证明去年抓紧实现初级形式的农业合作化，是十分必要的，是符合群众愿望和发展生产的要求的。在这个基础上，今年春季基本实现高级形式的农业合作化，也是完全可能和必要的。因为：
    一，根据我们在去年下半年的调查，在初级社中，除了还有10％左右的农户（主要是富裕户和缺乏劳力的困难户）有顾虑外，其余的农户，特别是其中的贫农和下中农，都积极要求转社。我省从1954年到1956年9月，共试办了二万多个高级社，农民从试办中深深体会到：高级社比初级社优越。高级社由于取消了土地和其他主要生产资料的私有制，执行了“各尽所能，按劳取酬”的原则，不仅保证了更好地贯彻执行国家的政策和计划，而且从根本上解放了生产力。高级社有条件在集体所有的土地上，运用充足的劳动力，兴修水利，进行土地加工，改进耕作技术。因此，高级社在1956年一般增产20％左右，有的达到50％以上，比初级社有显著的增产；加上家庭副业收入，保证了90％以上的社员增加收入。根据郫县等九个县的统计，所有参加1956年收益分配的七十二个高级社中，增产社有六十八个（增产20％以下的二十个，21％—30％的二十七个，增产31％以上的二十一个），保产社和减产社各有二个（主要是受灾）；参加收益分配的二万六千五百三十五户社员户中，减少收入户只占7.5％。增产和增加收入的幅度，都比初级社高。这些事实，都为初级社社员所向往，他们纷纷自动要求转社。这种要求成为农村群众的思想主流。
    有少数社员不愿转社，甚至要求退社，也是事实。但是他们是些什么人呢？根据在德阳、剑阁县的调查，上中农中有占本阶层55％的农户不愿转社，他们的土地多，或有其他商业性的经济收入，怕在参加高级社后会减少收入；下中农和贫农中，也有占本阶层8％的农户还不愿转社，他们兼有小商贩、手工业收入，或者劳动力少，也怕在参加高级社后减少收入。在经过春节大规模地展开政治宣传工作后，少数社员不愿转社和退社的情况已经很少存在了。
    二，我省目前农业社的质量是好的。从生产情况和干部的领导能力来看，一类社占60％，二类社占30％，三类社占10％。高级社的主要干部，一般在转社前参加过短期训练，学习了集体生产的经营办法，加上几年来合作化运动的实际锻炼，这就为转社工作打下了较好的基础。大多数社在经过总结生产、检查和健全经营管理制度以及制订今后的生产计划后，积极开展了增产运动。各社社员的劳动出勤率一般由去年冬季的60％左右提高到80％—90％以上；全面进行了积肥和兴修水利工作；不少社员积极向合作社投资。从目前情况来看，随着高级形式的农业合作化的基本实现，新的生产高潮开始到来了。当然，不是说我们的工作中没有困难，如像在土地报酬取消以后，争取90％的社员增加收入，就不是轻易能够办到的，这就需要我们从各方面努力来争取。
    去年全省增产粮食四十多亿斤
    其次，谈谈我省在1956年的农业生产问题和农民的生活情况。
    我省1956年的粮食产量比1955年增加10％，净增四十点四亿斤；棉花播种面积比1955年扩大了，但单位面积因灾减产，总产量基本上保持1955年的水平；甘蔗比1955年增产25.7％。全省出现了一批亩产千斤粮，万斤蔗、百斤棉的合作社。取得这样大的增产原因：第一是由于基本上实现了农业合作化。据十二个专区十四万三千四百零五个社的统计，1956年的增产社有89.4％，保持1955年水平的社有5％，减产的社只有5.6％。如果把合作化以前和合作化以后的增产情况比较一下是很有意义的，在合作化以前，1954年比1953年增产6.6％（净增二十四点一九亿斤），1955年比1954年增产3.63％（净增十四点一七亿斤）；可是在合作化以后，1956年虽然自然灾害较多，仍然比1955年增产10％（净增四十点四亿斤），超过以前两年的增产总数，这就证明了农业合作化是增产的可靠基础，是当前增产收效最快的办法。
    第二，在建社工作结束后，全部力量立即转向生产，立即抓社的经营管理。特别是抓紧推行包工包产制度，使合作社建立初期那种生产无人负责的混乱现象，很快的基本上结束了。同时，从合作社转入生产时起，就抓紧了恢复和发展副业的工作，免除一些不合理的限制；订生产计划时，就抓紧结合制定财务收支计划，贯彻执行勤俭办社的原则，研究并制订了收益分配方案，规定各项开支和公共提留的合理标准，这对增加生产、增加收入和社的巩固起了重要作用。
    第三，由于在合作化的基础上，抓紧推行和试验多种多样的先进增产措施。我省在批判和克服保守思想的基础上，因地制宜、因时制宜的推广双季稻间种套种、增种一季晚秋作物，以增加复种面积，普遍推广和选用了外地、当地的各种良种，积极兴修水利和积肥造肥，改变耕作制度，大胆进行各种技术的改革和试验等，找出许多增产窍门，挖掘了大量的增产潜力。
    我省1956年的复种指数由1955年的155％增加到161.62％。其中粮食作物复种面积增加了八百八十八万亩（包括双季稻四百五十万亩，增种一季晚秋作物三百万亩）。由于增加复种面积而增产的粮食达到十七点七六亿斤，约占全省粮食增产总数的44％。内江专区1956年出现了四十九个亩产粮食千斤的农业合作社，他们的复种指数都在19％以上，粮食播种面积一般增加15％左右。
    1956年我省所推广的先进增产措施本身都是对的，也都符合农民发展生产的要求；但是某些社在推广的时候，主要由于传授和指导工作做得不准确，效果不大或者不好。也有一些地方，由于领导作风上没有贯彻群众路线，有主观主义，对于因地制宜、因时制宜的精神体会得不够，所以推广了一些不合当地、当时的具体情况的东西，得到相反的结果，受了一些损失，引起了一部分群众的不满。内江专区推广技术工作的总结是有代表性的，这个专区所推广的技术中，77％是技术正确而推广得较好的，22％是技术正确，推广中出了一些毛病的，而根本不正确的只占1％。
    去年农业人口平均每人增加收入14％以上
    随着农村副业生产的发展，农民的收入也有相应的增加，生活得到了改善。1956年全省农副业总值比1955年增加16.6％（包括农、副业产品提价增加的收入），差不多相当以往两年增加的收入。全省每个农业人口平均总收入八十五元九角，比1955年每人平均总收入七十五元增加14.5％。根据十二个专区十四万三千四百零五个社收益分配的统计，有88％以上的社员增加了收入，有83.5％的社做到90％以上的社员增加收入（这个统计中没有计算社员的家庭副业收入，如果计算进去，增产的社和增加收入的社员就还要多些）。因此农村里是一片高兴，办社信心很高，生产劲头很大。自然，也有少数社员没有增加收入，或者收入比入社前有所减少，心里不高兴，思想上对合作社还有些动摇。不过，减少收入的原因很多，要具体分析情况，不能一概而论。首先是去年减产的社大都遇到不能完全战胜的自然灾害，这在今后较长时期内也是无法避免的。其次，有些减产社也确是由于我们工作上缺乏经验而造成的。例如在转社并社中不应该把一些经济基础过分悬殊的社并在一起，使得一部分原来收入较多的社员减少了收入；有些高级社在土地报酬取消以后，对劳动力少而弱的社员调配不当，使他们少做劳动日，减少了收入。这些问题在合作社进行决算分配和去冬今春的整社工作中，已经注意纠正，并且在今后工作中，还需要继续注意。至于少数土地多、产量高、收入大的富裕农民，在入社后一两年或者更多一些的时间内，合作社还难以保证他们都增加收入，这是事实；但是在发展生产的基础上，做好工作，是可以逐年争取使这些户增加收入的。有些老社的事实，已经证明了这个问题。在收益分配工作中，也存在着一些缺点。例如一年分配两次（小春预支，大春决算），时间上有些集中、过长，部分农民（主要是富裕农民）还没有习惯，感到用钱紧，不像单干时那样松劲。另外，有些社的分配工作做得粗糙，对社员的思想教育不够细致、耐心，领导作风上民主精神差，有事跟群众商量不够等等。
    以上这些缺点，固然是由于我们缺乏经验，在这样规模巨大的运动中难以避免的，但是有的则是由于我们主观上的努力不够造成的。这些缺点和问题，我省农业部门都很重视，正在总结研究和逐步改进。
    农民生活的改善，除了增产的主要原因而外，还由于国家在降低工业品销售价和提高农产品的收购价以后农民的收入更有所增加。1956年7月，我省近三百种工业品的价格普遍降低了3.3％，而农、林、副产品中约有50％的品种提高了价格（其中大米收购价提高6％，毛猪收购价提高11％），这样，在一年内，全省农民就可以增加收入一亿二千多万元，和由于降低工业品销售价格而减少支出二千五百多万元。以全省农业人口平均，每人增加收入二点三元。由此可知，农民的收入是增加了，因此农民的生活也得到了不同程度的改善。第一，农民有更多的钱储蓄了。1956年全省农民存款的数目即比1955年增加82.82％。第二，农民的生活消费品增长了。1956年每个农业人口平均消费粮食四百九十五斤（统计局根据十二个基点材料综合），比1955年每人平均消费粮食四百六十九斤，增加5.54％。农村其他生活资料的消费比1955年增加了8.5％，而其中以主要的生活日用品增加最多，如以1955年的销售量作为一百，则1956年棉布增加23.8％，针织品、棉织品增加98.34％，文教用品增加106.37％。第三，农村贫困户减少了。全省1955年占农业户15％左右的贫困户，经过国家和合作社的扶持，已经下降到10％左右。根据内江县顺江农业社四百六十七户社员的调查，1953年贫困户占14％，1954年下降了0.3％，1955年又下降了1.3％，1956年转成高级社后，就下降了3.7％，贫困户只占到总户数的8.7％。有些历史较老生产发展较快的社，已基本上消除了贫困户。
    去年一年当中，我们在农业生产战线上取得的成绩是巨大的，取得的经验是丰富的，有益的教训也是不少的，我们要认真地总结这些宝贵的经验和教训，巩固既得的成绩，克服我们的缺点和错误，一定努力实现中共中央、国务院和毛主席的号召，“想尽一切办法，千方百计，争取今年农业大丰收。”
    以上发言有不妥的地方，请各位委员、各位同志批评、指正。（附图片）
