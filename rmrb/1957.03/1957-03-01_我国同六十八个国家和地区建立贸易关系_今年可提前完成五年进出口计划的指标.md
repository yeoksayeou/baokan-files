Xinhua News Agency, 25th – By the end of 1956, China's first Five-Year Plan's import and export plan had cumulatively reached 84.35%. This year, it is likely that the various targets stipulated in the first Five-Year import and export plan will be completed ahead of schedule.

　　This was said by a person in charge of the Ministry of Foreign Trade to a Xinhua News Agency reporter today.

　　He went on to say that currently, China has signed intergovernmental trade agreements with twenty-one countries and has trade relations with sixty-eight countries and regions.

　　When talking about the foreign trade situation last year, this person in charge said that China's trade with Asian and African countries and certain regions has greatly developed in the past year. In 1956, the trade volume with Asian and African countries and regions increased by 39.4% compared with 1955, which is one and a half times that of 1953.

　　He also said that China's trade volume with Asian and African countries and regions reached 64% of China's total trade volume with capitalist countries last year. But even so, China's trade with Western countries has also made great progress. In 1956, China's trade volume with Western countries increased by 29% compared with 1955. This person in charge went on to say that, however, the governments of some Western countries are still continuing to pursue discriminatory trade policies. If these artificial obstacles are not eliminated, trade between China and Western countries cannot develop normally and reach the level it should.

　　When talking about China's trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, this person in charge said that China's trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries still occupies an extremely important position in China's foreign trade and is a reliable foundation for China's foreign trade. China's trade with these countries has played a very important role in the construction of China's first Five-Year Plan and has become an important aspect of further realizing close economic cooperation with each other.

    我国同六十八个国家和地区建立贸易关系
    今年可提前完成五年进出口计划的指标
    新华社25日讯  到1956年年底为止，我国第一个五年计划的进出口计划已经累计完成84.35％，今年可能提前完成第一个五年进出口计划中所规定的各项指标。
    这是对外贸易部一位负责人今天对新华社记者说的。
    他接着说，目前，我国已经同二十一个国家签订了政府间的贸易协定，同六十八个国家和地区发生着贸易关系。
    在谈到去年对外贸易情况时，这位负责人说，我国同亚非国家和某些地区的贸易在过去一年中有很大的发展。1956年对亚非国家和地区的贸易额比1955年增长了39.4％，为1953年的一倍半。
    他还说，我国同亚非国家和地区的贸易额在去年已达到我国对资本主义国家贸易总额的64％。但是即使这样，我国对西方国家的贸易同样也有很大进展，1956年我国对西方国家的贸易额比1955年增长了29％。这位负责人接着说，但是，目前某些西方国家的政府仍在继续奉行贸易歧视政策。这种人为的障碍如果不消除，我国同西方国家之间的贸易就不可能得到正常的发展而达到应有的水平。
    谈到我国同苏联和人民民主国家的贸易时，这位负责人说，我国同苏联和人民民主国家的贸易，在我国对外贸易中仍占着极其重要的地位，是我国对外贸易可靠的基础。我国同这些国家开展贸易对我国第一个五年计划建设起了十分重要的作用，并且成为彼此间进一步实现紧密的经济合作的一个重要方面。
