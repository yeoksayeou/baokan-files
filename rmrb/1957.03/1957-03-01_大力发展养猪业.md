    Vigorously Develop the Pig Farming Industry

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have issued a decision on developing pig production. Party and government leading organs at all levels and relevant departments should immediately assist agricultural production cooperatives and individual farmers throughout the country to conscientiously implement this decision, so as to further develop the pig farming industry.

    There are many benefits to developing the pig farming industry. First of all, raising more pigs means accumulating more manure, and accumulating more manure means harvesting more grain. In areas where more pigs are raised, the fertilizer problem is easily solved, and the yield per unit area of crops will also increase. This means that because there are more pigs, there is more manure, and there is also more grain; and as a result of more grain, there will be more pigs, which can guarantee continuous agricultural production increases. Conversely, in some places there are few pigs, little manure, and little grain; and because there is little grain, there are even fewer pigs, and agricultural production can only maintain a lower level. Therefore, in order to increase agricultural production and increase crop yields, it is necessary to advocate raising more pigs. At the same time, we know that pig farming is an important sideline occupation for the vast rural areas of our country. Among the meat consumption of the vast urban and rural people in our country, pork accounts for the largest proportion. If pig farming is not developed on a large scale, it will affect the income of farmers and the supply of meat to urban and rural people. Moreover, pork and bristles are important export commodities of our country. They can be exchanged for chemical fertilizers, machinery, steel, etc., which also play a great role in supporting national economic construction.

    In the past few years, China's pig farming industry has developed greatly. From 1949 to 1954, the number of pigs raised nationwide increased year by year. However, during the period from July 1954 to June 1956, the total number of pigs raised nationwide did not continue to grow, but instead decreased. Although this downward trend began to stop in the second half of last year, the situation has not fundamentally improved. The decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on developing pig production specifically analyzed the reasons for the decline in pig production and clearly put forward specific measures. Conscientious implementation of this decision can fundamentally improve the situation.

    The purchase price of live pigs must be adjusted. In the past, the purchase price was too low to adapt to the new situation of increased pig raising costs after agricultural cooperation, so that farmers gained little profit, or even no profit, from raising pigs. Now, the relevant departments of the central government, after a long period of investigation in many aspects, and comparing it with the prices of several kinds of commodities, have decided to appropriately increase the purchase price of live pigs nationwide from today, so as to ensure that agricultural cooperatives and farmers can obtain reasonable profits from raising pigs under normal feeding management. This will encourage farmers to use various methods to explore feed sources, raise more pigs, and raise them well, to meet the needs of the country and the people.

    Of course, due to different conditions in various places, and because the original purchase price of live pigs was lower to varying degrees, the methods of this adjustment cannot be exactly the same. In particular, in order to reduce regional price differences and the purchase and sales price differences for local purchases and local sales, the increase in some areas with lower prices and counties around large cities, industrial and mining areas should be higher than in general areas. That is to say, the magnitude of this price increase varies from province to province and county to county, and is not exactly the same. Individual provinces that have already significantly increased the purchase price of live pigs after August last year will not be increased this time.

    After the purchase price of live pigs is increased, the sales price of pork in urban and rural areas must be increased accordingly. However, in order not to excessively increase the burden on consumers, the state has decided to increase the sales price of pork only slightly. The additional funds invested due to the increase in the purchase price are estimated to be more than 200 million yuan for the whole year, most of which will still be borne by the state. Farmers can get several to more than ten yuan more for selling a pig than in the past, while buying a pound of meat will only cost a few cents more. This is a reasonable approach.

    After the purchase price of live pigs is increased, the enthusiasm of farmers to raise pigs will be greatly increased, and the pig farming industry will inevitably develop. However, this does not mean that there are no difficulties in realizing the state's pig production plan, and that no other work is needed. On the contrary, after the enthusiasm of farmers to raise pigs is increased, it not only becomes more urgent to solve the old problems that have already occurred and to realize the various measures stipulated in the central government's decision, but also some new situations and new problems will arise, which need to be solved by party and government organizations at all levels, relevant departments and agricultural production cooperatives in a timely and effective manner.

    In addition to conscientiously doing a good job in the relevant work of increasing the purchase price this time, the departments in charge of live pig management must, under the unified leadership of party committees and governments at all levels, cooperate with the departments in charge of live pig production to vigorously promote the development of live pig production. For example, promoting improved breeds, regulating piglets, helping agricultural cooperatives arrange pig production plans, improving feeding work, strengthening epidemic prevention work, promoting substitute feeds, and investigating and understanding the implementation of production plans and existing problems, etc., all require the active cooperation of relevant departments. The departments in charge of live pig management should also strengthen the purchase and transportation work in remote areas and mountainous areas. Due to the reduction of regional price differences, these areas will automatically require the state to purchase live pigs. Operating units should also strive to overcome shortcomings in their work, improve work efficiency, correctly implement price policies, simplify grade specifications, stipulate reasonable grade verification tolerances, do a good job in democratic appraisal, prevent the act of suppressing grades and prices, and avoid affecting the enthusiasm of farmers to raise and sell pigs due to shortcomings in the purchase work. The decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council this time requires that staff who accurately verify grades be rewarded, and at the same time, it requires that staff who continue to engage in serious suppression of grades and prices be punished, which is very necessary. Relevant departments should quickly formulate measures to implement them, and strengthen ideological education and technical guidance for purchasing personnel, so as to better prevent the phenomenon of suppressing grades and prices.

    China's total grain output increased again last year, which is a favorable condition for developing the pig farming industry. However, compared with the growing needs of the country, the increase in grain is still not abundant. Therefore, grain must first be used to ensure the consumption of urban and rural people and the needs of national construction. Under this situation, it is necessary to educate and mobilize the masses of farmers not to simply rely on the state to supply grain as feed, but to find and collect various kinds of feed in each season to replace part of the grain. The pig raising experience of the Shimen Song Township Agricultural Cooperative in Yanggu County, Shandong Province, proves that as long as the members are good at mobilizing to collect various substitute feeds and store them properly, they can raise many and good pigs without much grain. As for the grain and oil that are excessively concentrated to cities for processing, they should be appropriately distributed to rural areas, and the production of tofu workshops, flour workshops, and oil workshops that have been shut down in rural areas should be restored as much as possible, and the excessively high prices of bran and chaff in certain areas should be appropriately reduced. These are all things that should and can be done.

    Agricultural departments at all levels and rural staff in various places should more specifically help agricultural cooperatives arrange live pig production, strengthen the leadership of live pig feeding work, strengthen the prevention and treatment of diseases and drug supply, and help agricultural cooperatives properly solve feed problems. Agricultural cooperatives with conditions can develop some green feed bases and plant high-yield feed crops on the premise of not affecting grain production, so that feed can be guaranteed to a certain extent. At present, many agricultural cooperatives are revising or formulating this year's agricultural and sideline production increase plans. For pig raising work, it is necessary to conscientiously make arrangements in the entire plan. Party and government organizations at all levels should supervise relevant departments, quickly formulate specific implementation plans, and promptly inspect to ensure that the decisions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council are quickly and smoothly implemented.

### 大力发展养猪业

    大力发展养猪业
    中共中央和国务院发出了关于发展养猪生产的决定。各级党政领导机关和有关部门，应该立即帮助全国各地的农业生产合作社和个体农民，认真地贯彻执行这个决定，使养猪业有进一步的发展。
    发展养猪业有许多好处。首先，多养猪才能多积肥，多积肥才能多收粮食。凡是养猪较多的地方，肥料问题就容易解决，农作物的单位面积产量也会提高。这就是说，因为猪多，粪多，粮食也多；而粮食多了的结果，养猪就会更多，就能保证农业不断地增产。反过来，有些地方猪少，粪少，粮食也少；而且因为粮食少的结果，养猪就更少，农业生产也就只能维持较低的水平。因此，为了增加农业生产，提高农作物产量，必须提倡多养猪。同时，我们知道，养猪业是我国广大农村的重要副业。我国广大城乡人民的肉食消费中以猪肉所占的比重为最大。如果不大量发展养猪，就会影响农民的收入和城乡人民肉食的供应。而猪肉和猪鬃又是我国重要出口物资。它们可以换取化学肥料、机器、钢材等，对于支援国家经济建设也有很大的作用。
    几年来，我国的养猪业已有很大的发展。从1949年到1954年，全国养猪的数量一年比一年增加。但是，在1954年7月到1956年6月的期间，全国养猪总数却没有继续增长，反而下降了。这种下降的趋势，从去年下半年起虽然开始停止，但是情况还没有根本的好转。中共中央和国务院关于发展养猪生产的决定，具体分析了引起生猪生产下降的原因，明确地提出了具体措施。切实执行这个决定就可以使情况有根本的好转。
    生猪的收购价格必须调整。过去收购价格过低，不能适应农业合作化以后养猪成本提高的新情况，以致农民养猪得利很少，甚至无利可图。现在，中央有关部门经过多方面的较长时期的调查，并且同若干种商品的价格作了比较研究，决定从今天起把全国生猪收购价格作适当的提高，以保证农业社和农民养猪在正常饲养管理的情况下，都能获得合理的利润。这将鼓励农民用各种方法去发掘饲料来源，更多养猪，把猪养好，以满足国家和人民的需要。
    当然，由于各地情况不同，由于各地原来生猪收购价格偏低的程度不一，这次调整的办法不能完全一样。特别是为了缩小地区差价和就地购进、就地销售的购销差价，某些价格偏低的地区和大城市、工矿区周围县份提高的幅度要高于一般地区。也就是说，这次价格提高的幅度，具体表现在各省各县有大有小，不尽相同。个别省份在去年8月以后已经把生猪收购价格作了较大幅度的提高的，这次就不再提高了。
    生猪收购价格提高以后，必须相应地提高城乡猪肉的销售价格。但是，国家为了不过多地增加消费者的负担，决定猪肉销售价格只稍为提高一点点。因提高收购价格而多投放的资金，预计全年有两亿多元，绝大部分仍由国家负担。农民卖一头猪可以比过去多得几元至十几元，而买一斤肉只不过多付出几分钱。这样做是合理的。
    生猪收购价格提高以后，农民养猪的积极性会大大提高，养猪业必将有所发展。但是，这并不等于实现国家的养猪生产计划就没有困难了，就不需要做其他工作了。正相反，农民养猪积极性提高以后，不仅更加迫切要求解决已经发生的老问题，要求实现中央决定中所规定的各项措施，而且还会出现一些新的情况和新的问题，需要各级党政组织、各有关部门和农业生产合作社及时地有效地加以解决。
    主管生猪经营的部门，除了要认真作好这次提高收购价格的有关工作以外，必须在各级党和政府的统一领导下，配合主管生猪生产的部门，大力促进生猪生产的发展。比如推广良种，调剂仔猪，帮助农业社安排养猪生产计划、改进饲养工作、加强防疫工作，推广代用饲料，以及调查了解生产计划的执行情况和存在的问题等等，都需要各有关部门主动地配合进行。主管生猪经营的部门还应该加强对边远地区和山区的购运工作。由于地区差价缩小，这些地区都会自动要求国家收购生猪。经营单位还应该努力克服工作中的缺点，提高工作效率，正确执行价格政策，简化等级规格，规定合理验级公差，搞好民主评议，防止压级压价的行为，避免因收购工作中发生的缺点而影响农民养猪和卖猪的积极性。这次中共中央和国务院的决定，要求对验级准确的工作人员加以奖励，同时也要求对继续发生严重压级压价行为的人员加以惩罚，这是很必要的。有关部门应该迅速制定办法，加以实施，并加强对收购人员的思想教育和技术指导，以便更好地防止压级压价现象。
    我国粮食总产量去年又有所增加，这对于发展养猪业是一个有利的条件。但是粮食的增产同全国日益增长的需要比较起来，仍然是不宽裕的。因此，粮食首先要用来保证城乡人民的吃用和国家建设的需要。在这种情况下，必须教育和发动农民群众，不要单纯地依靠国家供应粮食做饲料，而要在各个季节里，寻找和采集各种各样的饲料，以代替一部分粮食。山东省阳谷县石门宋乡农业社的养猪经验证明，只要善于发动社员搜集各种代用饲料，并且用适当的方法加以贮存，不用多少粮食就可以把猪养得很多很好。至于过分集中到城市加工的粮食和油料，应该适当地向农村分散，尽可能地恢复农村停业的豆腐坊、粉坊、油坊的生产，适当地降低某些地区过高的糠、麸价格等。这些都是应该办而且可能办到的事情。
    各级农业部门和各地农村工作人员，应当更具体地帮助农业社安排生猪生产，加强对生猪饲养工作的领导，加强防治疫病和药物供应的工作，帮助农业社妥善地解决饲料问题。有条件的农业社可以在不影响粮食增产的前提下，发展一些青饲料基地，种植高产饲料作物，使饲料得到一定的保证。目前许多农业社正在修订或制定今年的农副业增产计划，对于养猪工作，必须认真地在整个计划中作好安排。各级党政组织应该监督有关部门，迅速拟定具体实施方案，及时检查，以保证中共中央和国务院的决定迅速地顺利地贯彻执行。
