Xinhua News Agency report:

    The restoration and reconstruction project of China's first state-owned chemical fiber factory – the Anshan Chemical Fiber Factory – is being actively carried out. It is expected to begin trial operation on this year's "May Day" and officially commence production on "July 1st".

    Since construction began in July last year, the civil engineering work on the factory buildings has now been about 80% completed. Mechanical installation is proceeding intensely in the twelve main production sections, with the mechanical installation of the impregnation, drying, and packaging production sections being basically completed.

    After the factory goes into production, it will use wood pulp raw material to produce artificial wool; this artificial wool can be blended with wool or tussah silk and other short fibers to produce yarn, blankets, wool fabrics, clothing and other products.

    The design work for this reconstruction was carried out by our country itself after studying advanced Soviet experience.

    安东化学纤维厂加紧改建
    据新华社讯  我国第一座国营化学纤维厂——安东化学纤维厂的恢复改建工程，正在积极进行，预计在今年“五一”开始试车，“七一”正式开工生产。
    这个厂从去年7月开始动工以来，厂房土建工程现在已经完成了80％左右。十二个主要生产工段正在紧张安装机械，其中浸渍、干燥、打包三个生产工段的机械安装工程已经基本完工。
    这个厂投入生产以后，将用木浆原料生产出人造毛；这种人造毛可以用来同羊毛或柞蚕丝等短纤维混纺出毛线、毛毯、呢子、衣料等产品。
    这次改建的设计工作，是我国学习了苏联先进经验后自己进行的。
