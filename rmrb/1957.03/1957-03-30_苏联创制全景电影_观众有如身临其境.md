Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 29th: The Soviet Union has recently successfully created an experimental device for the newest type of wide-screen movie – "panoramic cinema." Soon, one of Moscow's largest cinemas will be renovated to specifically show these movies.

This "panoramic cinema" surpasses the American manufacturers' "Cinerama," which is still a closely guarded secret in its production process, in certain aspects. Its main feature is maximizing the audience's field of vision, allowing them to see within a range of one hundred and fifty to sixty degrees with both eyes, thereby creating a sense of being on-site, as if they were personally present.

"Panoramic cinema" applies the principle of stereophonic sound, using nine sets of loudspeakers, three more than the American "Cinerama." Five sets are installed behind the screen, two sets on both sides of the hall, one set on the wall opposite the screen, and one set on the ceiling of the hall. When the movie is playing, the nine separately recorded audio tapes will rotate at a speed one-half faster than that of ordinary movie audio tapes. This strengthens the stereophonic effect of the sound and enables all different levels of sound to be transmitted to the audience's ears while completely preserving their original timbre.

The "panoramic cinema" screen, like the American "Cinerama" screen, is concave. Its curvature reaches approximately one hundred and fifty degrees, which reaches the maximum angle of human eye vision. (In ordinary cinemas, the screen's angle of view to the audience's eyes is only about twenty degrees, and for general wide-screen movies it is seventy degrees.)

The "panoramic cinema" screen is twenty meters wide and more than seven meters high, made of snow-white, strong plastic. Its structure is different from ordinary screens, composed of three parts pieced together. The projection of "panoramic cinema" is carried out by three sound-synchronized film projectors. These projectors are able to combine the copies they project into a complete image on the screen.

The camera for shooting "panoramic cinema" is also specially made. It can simultaneously capture the scene on three 35mm wide film strips. In addition, a special printer has been manufactured to reproduce the "panoramic cinema" film.

　　苏联创制全景电影
　　观众有如身临其境
    新华社莫斯科29日电  苏联最近已经创制成功了一种最新式的宽银幕电影——“全景电影”的实验装置。不久，莫斯科一家最大的电影院就将改装，专门放映这种电影。
    这种“全景电影”在某些地方胜过了美国制片商至今还在制造过程上保守秘密的另一种宽银幕电影“星涅拉马”。它的主要特点是最大限度地利用观众的视角，使他们两眼能够看到一百五、六十度内的景象，因而有一种现场感，好像自己也身临其境一样。
    “全景电影”应用立体声的原理，装置九组扩音器，比美国“星涅拉马”多三组。其中五组装在银幕后面，两组装在大厅两边，一组装在和银幕相对的墙壁上，一组装在大厅的天花板上。电影放映的时候，九条分别录过音的录音带将以比普通电影的录音带快二分之一的速度转动。这样，就可以加强声音的立体感，并且能够使各种高低不同的声音完全保持原来的音色而传到观众的耳朵里去。
      “全景电影”的银幕和美国“星涅拉马”银幕一样是凹形的。它的弧度约达一百五十度，即达到了人眼视角的最大角度。（在普通电影院中，银幕对观众眼睛的视角只有二十度左右，一般宽银幕电影是七十度。）
    “全景电影”银幕宽二十公尺，高七公尺多，是用雪白的牢固塑料制成的。它的构造和一般的银幕不同，由三个部分拼成。“全景电影”的放映是靠三台声画吻合的电影放映机进行。这些放映机能够使它们放映的拷贝在银幕上合成一个完整的形象。
    拍摄“全景电影”的摄影机也是特制的。它能够同时把镜头拍摄在三条宽三十五毫米的胶卷上。此外，还制造了专门的印片机来复印“全景电影”的胶片。
