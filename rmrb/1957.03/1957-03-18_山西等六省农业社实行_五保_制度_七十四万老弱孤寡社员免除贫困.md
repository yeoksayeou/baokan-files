Xinhua News Agency, 17th - According to incomplete statistics from six provinces including Shanxi, Hubei, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Liaoning, and Fujian, 740,000 agricultural cooperative members in rural areas who lack labor or have completely lost their labor ability, and are old, weak, orphaned, widowed, or disabled, and have no means of support, are enjoying the "Five Guarantees" treatment provided by advanced agricultural production cooperatives, which includes guaranteeing food, clothing, fuel, education, and burial.

　　This group of people enjoying the "Five Guarantees" have changed their past state of poverty with shortages of clothing and food, and are living a carefree life. In Shanxi Province, there are more than 170,000 agricultural households enjoying the "Five Guarantees". Last year, each person received an average subsidy of 22.3 yuan from the agricultural cooperatives. Together with state relief and their own labor income, their lives have caught up with or approached the living standards of ordinary farmers. The "Five Guarantees" households of the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan Township, Pingshun County, had an average income of 51.5 yuan per person last year, more than double the previous year. Many agricultural cooperatives in Guangdong Province have determined the living standards of the "Five Guarantees" households according to the principle of being slightly lower than the living standards of ordinary cooperative members. Some "Five Guarantees" households now have incomes four times higher than when they relied on land rent in the past. In addition to implementing the "Five Guarantees," some agricultural cooperatives also implement "Guarantee Medical Care" (guarantee treatment) and "Guarantee Housing" (repair houses). Cadres in many townships and agricultural cooperatives in Hubei Province also frequently visit the homes of "Five Guarantees" households to help them solve difficulties.

　　Many cooperatives have appropriately determined the targets and standards of the "Five Guarantees" and have helped "Five Guarantees" households with certain labor abilities to participate in light labor and household sideline production. Therefore, the "Five Guarantees" burden on agricultural cooperatives is not heavy. According to statistics from Liaoning Province, the "Five Guarantees" expenses generally account for only 30% to 50% of the total welfare fund of agricultural cooperatives; in Maoming County, Guangdong Province, it accounts for only 20%. For some agricultural cooperatives with poor economic conditions, the government has also promptly distributed relief funds, and the income of cooperative members has not been affected by the implementation of the "Five Guarantees."

### 山西等六省农业社实行“五保”制度  七十四万老弱孤寡社员免除贫困

    山西等六省农业社实行“五保”制度
    七十四万老弱孤寡社员免除贫困
    新华社17日讯　据山西、湖北、广东、江苏、辽宁、福建等六省的不完全统计，在农村中已有七十四万名缺乏劳动力或者完全丧失劳动力、生活没有依靠的老、弱、孤、寡、残疾的农业社社员，享受到高级农业生产合作社给予的保吃、保穿、保烧、保教、保葬的“五保”待遇。
    这批享受“五保”的人已经改变了过去缺衣、少食的贫困状况，过着无忧无虑的生活。山西省高级农业社中享受“五保”的农户共有十七万多人，去年平均每人得到农业社的补助二十二元三角，连同国家救济和他们自己的劳动收入，生活已经赶上或接近一般农民的生活水平。平顺县城关乡曙光农业社的“五保”户去年每人平均收入五十一元五角，比前年增加一倍以上。广东省许多农业社按稍低于一般社员生活水平的原则确定了“五保”户的生活标准。有的 “五保”户现在的收入比过去依靠地租时增加了四倍。有些农业社除了实行“五保”外，还实行“保医”（保治病）和保住（修房）。湖北省许多乡和农业社的干部还经常到“五保”户家中访问，帮助他们解决困难。
    许多社由于恰当地确定了“五保”的对象和标准，并且帮助还有一定劳动能力的“五保”户参加轻微劳动和家庭副业生产，因而农业社的“五保”负担并不重。据辽宁省统计，“五保”费用一般只占农业社公益金总数的30％到50％；广东省茂名县只占20％。对于一些经济条件较差的农业社，政府也都及时地发放了救济款，没有因推行“五保”而影响社员收入。
