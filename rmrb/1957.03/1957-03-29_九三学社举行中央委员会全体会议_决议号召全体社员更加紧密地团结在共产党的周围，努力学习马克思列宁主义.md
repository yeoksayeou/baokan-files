Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The Jiusan Society held its Second Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee from the 22nd to the 28th.

　　Over 120 central committee members and heads of local organizations attending the meeting as observers discussed in groups the issues raised by Chairman Xu Deheng in his opening speech, which included the implementation of the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" in the current work of the Jiusan Society, the further strengthening of political and ideological work, the further development and consolidation of the organization, and the further strengthening of leadership and improvement of leadership at all levels.

　　The meeting passed a resolution this afternoon. The resolution stated that the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" put forward by the Chinese Communist Party and the democratic parties is a major development of Marxism-Leninism combined with Chinese reality, and is an extremely important way to develop socialist democracy and correctly handle contradictions among the people. The meeting unanimously agreed that contradictions among the people are mainly issues of right and wrong, and should start from the desire for unity, and through criticism, achieve further unity on a new basis to seek the resolution of contradictions. The resolution called on members of the Jiusan Society to continue to study Marxism-Leninism, raise their awareness, strengthen their sense of responsibility as masters of the country, care about national affairs, and actively resolve contradictions in coordination with all parties; faithfully accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and implement the Party's policies.

　　Regarding political and ideological education, the resolution stated that the Jiusan Society's past political and ideological education work was far from sufficient, and in the future, it must vigorously promote and help members to seriously study Marxism-Leninism and national policies in connection with their own work; learn from workers and peasants, make friends with workers and peasants, cultivate the ideological feelings of serving workers and peasants, and encourage members to actively strive to participate in the Chinese Communist Party's rectification study; and gradually establish a dialectical materialist worldview through various practices.

　　The resolution pointed out that the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is an important way to develop science, promote truth, oppose dogmatism and revisionism, overcome bourgeois ideology, and carry out ideological transformation. The resolution requires members of the Jiusan Society and the masses connected with the society to dispel concerns, speak freely, adhere to the truth, correct mistakes, and carry out contention with an attitude of convincing people with reason. In the march towards science, research should be strengthened, each should make use of their strengths, and the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" should be earnestly implemented in practice.

　　The resolution stated that in order to adapt to the political needs of the country and the organizational demands of the masses, the organization should be actively developed in accordance with the principle of "combining development and consolidation" and the principles of "need, possibility, and voluntariness."

　　Regarding strengthening political and ideological leadership, the resolution stated that committees at all levels and various work departments should regularly analyze the situation, study problems, improve the quality of work, strengthen collective leadership, and promote democracy within the society. At the same time, in order to meet the needs of work, the various work organizations of the society at all levels should be enriched and improved.

　　The resolution called on all members of the Jiusan Society to unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party, and unite all forces that can be united. Vigorously practice increasing production and practicing economy, run all undertakings diligently and frugally, work hard, and strive to study Marxism-Leninism.
