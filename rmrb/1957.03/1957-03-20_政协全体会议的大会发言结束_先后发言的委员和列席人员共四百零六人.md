Xinhua News Agency, March 19th: The Third Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) concluded its plenary session speeches this morning. Today, eighteen people including Guo Moruo and Li Boqiu spoke at the meeting, and fifty-six others including Ji Chaoding submitted written statements.

From the afternoon of March 7th to this morning, a total of 406 members and observers spoke or submitted written statements in the general discussion, with 308 speeches, including those with multiple speeches and joint speeches.

Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that to ensure the smooth implementation of the Twelve-Year Science Development Plan, a very important issue is how to coordinate scientific research work according to the principle of "overall planning and appropriate arrangements." The Science Planning Commission of the State Council, entrusted by the Central Committee, has already begun this work in twenty-six areas. Guo Moruo said that the guideline for this coordination is to make full use of existing forces, closely integrate the forces of teaching, research, and production, and organize and adjust the national scientific team.

Li Boqiu, Wang Renxuan, Huang Nong, Deng Haoming, Zhu Yifeng, Fu Xiaoxian, Qiu Chen, He Zijian, Wang Yingke, Cheng Zuomou, Zhou Wuzhi, Lin Jingping, Chen Shizhao, and Chen Donghui, in a joint speech, used the historical facts of the establishment of a united front between democratic parties and the Communist Party to illustrate that accepting the leadership of the Communist Party does not hinder or weaken the organizational independence and political freedom of the democratic parties. On the contrary, the democratic parties have highly exerted their organizational role and embodied their political demands.

Zhou Yawei believes that current philologists have not undertaken the actual work responsibilities of Chinese character simplification, and simplified characters are unscientific. For the work of Chinese phonetics, the prerequisite of "pinyin schemes have multiple uses" must be practiced, and the basic principles of "phonemicization" and "one phoneme, one symbol, one symbol, one phoneme" must be implemented.

Zou Yixin, a researcher at the Zijinshan Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, made some suggestions on the establishment of China's International Latitude Station.

Yan Renying further explained the reasons why "induced abortion should only be performed in cases of necessity" from the perspective of an obstetrician and gynecologist.

Ji Chaoding, Vice Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, said that the domestic market of socialist countries expands with the development of its productive forces. Therefore, socialist countries advocate trade with all countries on the principles of equality and mutual benefit and do not need to compete for foreign markets, and of course, do not need to expand outwards.

Seven writers, Xiong Foxi, Cao Ming, Tang Tao, Ke Ling, Zhang Junxiang, Du Pengcheng, and Na·Sayinchogt, said in a joint speech that the thoughts, feelings, and tastes of the petty bourgeoisie will inevitably be reflected in the field of literature and art, and cannot be deterred by dogmatic criticism. Only by adhering to the truth, conducting specific and detailed research, and through well-intentioned criticism, reasoned persuasion, and debate, can correct opinions become clear.

Sun Lanfeng, Yan Fuqing, Shi Jinmo, He Lu, Xiong Dashi, and Meng Mudi spoke today on issues such as health and epidemic prevention work, the implementation of health policies, the establishment of research institutions for traditional Chinese medicine theory, the efficacy of Qigong therapy, the promotion of the veterinary heritage of the motherland, and the improvement of pharmacy work, respectively.

Dong Wenlong, Wang Wencheng, Zhang Shirang, and Chen Chonggui expressed their opinions separately or jointly on Catholic and Christian issues.

Gao Juefu and Wu Yanyin respectively talked about higher normal education and primary and secondary education issues.

Yu Beichen hopes that experts working in scientific research institutions will discover and cultivate more young scientists. Chen Jiefu made supplementary remarks on the issue of scientific and technological workers in production enterprise departments marching towards science. Dong Shouyi talked about the relevant issues of compiling "A History of Chinese Sports."

Ma Ke and Fang Xiaotian, in a joint speech, hoped that all parties would pay more attention to and support new operas. Li Zaiwen believes that the arguments that emerged after the repertoire conference that exclude new literary and art workers from participating in opera reform work are not beneficial to the development of the opera cause. Wu Tianbao suggested establishing a system of respecting teachers and loving apprentices to improve the methods of cultivating new forces in the opera world.

Wu Gengmei, Tang Di Yin, Zhang Lie, Zi Yaohua, Wu Jinhang, and Mi Zanchen expressed their opinions jointly or separately on the movement to increase production and practice economy, advocating people's savings, and strengthening the political and ideological work of employees.

Fu Xiaoxian, Luo Yuzhen, Jiang Yingke, and Ning Jiakui, who attended the meeting as observers, respectively introduced the work of local organizations of the CPPCC in Jiangxi Province, Jingdezhen City, and Fuzhou City.

Yun Xiutong talked about the tremendous achievements of the construction undertakings in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in recent years, and suggested that further attention should be paid to the safety and health of women in agricultural and pastoral production. Zai Tao introduced the care given to the Manchu people by the Party and the government after liberation, as well as the true equal treatment they have received.

Wu Wenzao hopes that old friends and old classmates in Taiwan and abroad will abandon all wishful thinking, dispel all concerns, and strive to return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible. Liu Zaifu, who attended the meeting as an observer, said that the Taiwan issue is of course China's internal affair, and no outside interference or infringement is allowed.

Wang Juren, Liu Duoquan, Deng Haoming, Zhang Zhonglu, and Lv Jiyi jointly spoke on the issue of developing local transportation. Zhu Gengsheng, who attended the meeting as an observer, introduced the experience of the Jiaxing shipping area in solving the difficulties of too many passengers and too few ships during the Spring Festival this year.

Gao Fengzhi, director of the Hongqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xingfu Township, Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, introduced how their cooperative ensured increased production last year despite the severe disaster. Chen Zhuofan and Li Zonglin and Lv Jiyi, who attended the meeting as observers, respectively introduced agricultural cooperation in Sichuan and Guangxi provinces, as well as the situation and problems of non-staple food supply in Guangdong Province.

Tang Wuyuan suggested that urban fecal fertilizer should be consumed as much as possible, and the manufacture of chemical fertilizers should be developed accordingly.

Lu Yaolin, who attended the meeting as an observer, introduced the great achievements and some problems existing in the movement to eliminate counter-revolutionaries launched in Hubei Province in 1955.

Hu Ziang believes that changing from a capitalist to a self-reliant laborer is a process of rebirth, which cannot be achieved without firm confidence and determination.

Dong Zhujun expressed her views on strengthening people's ideological education and further promoting democratic style. Cheng Ximeng talked about his experiences in ideological transformation and China's economic construction.

The general discussion in the morning began at 9:00 and ended at 10:20. Then, the members held group meetings to discuss the draft resolutions of the plenary session and the draft list of additional members of the Standing Committee of the National Committee.
