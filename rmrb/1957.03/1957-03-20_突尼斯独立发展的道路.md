    Tunisia's Path to Independent Development
    Xiao Guang

    Tunisia has been on the path of independent development for a full year.

    A year ago today, France and Tunisia signed a joint protocol declaring France's recognition of Tunisia's independence. When countless crimson flags with the crescent moon and star rose over this diamond-shaped land in the center of North Africa jutting out into the Mediterranean, the entire country of Tunisia was ecstatic. The elderly shed tears of joy; young Tunisians danced wildly in front of the ruins of the "French Protectorate." The copper plaques of Rue Jules Ferry and Boulevard de Paris were replaced with the names of heroes and martyrs of the independence movement; the signs, notices, and postmarks on public buildings were changed from French to Arabic; the statues of colonial pioneers were toppled one after another; slogans proclaiming "Independence!" appeared everywhere on the whitewashed walls…

    From the day they celebrated their independence, the Tunisian people set about clearing away the remnants of French colonial rule and strengthening the independence they had won through decades of arduous struggle. In the past year, significant progress has been made in this regard.

    The French have left Tunisian government offices; Tunisians have taken over every police post; Tunisia has regained control of railway management; the "Public Habous" (warehouses) have been liquidated and all property nationalized; the construction of water conservancy and hydroelectric projects, which are of great significance to Tunisia's national economy, has begun; agricultural workers' wages have been increased by 25%; some feudal social barriers and customs have been gradually removed; women have begun to cast off their veils and walk on the streets with their faces uncovered…. Certain democratic changes have also been adopted in the political system. For the first time in seventy-five years, Tunisians exercised their right to universal suffrage and elected their own constitutional assembly and government. Educated women over the age of twenty-one also enjoy the right to vote.

    In foreign relations, Tunisia adheres to the spirit of the Bandung Conference, stands with other Asian and African countries, pursues a policy of peace and national independence, and firmly supports the national struggle of the Algerian people against French colonial suppression.

    However, Tunisia's path to independent development is still strewn with thorns and obstacles. Although France was forced to recognize Tunisia's independence, it still wants to maintain its control over Tunisia as much as possible, just as it does with Morocco. It is precisely out of this colonialist consideration that France has not yet withdrawn all its colonial troops from Tunisian territory in accordance with the protocol recognizing Tunisia's independence. The Tunisian people have repeatedly called for the withdrawal of French troops, and the Tunisian government has repeatedly conducted formal negotiations with the French government, but the French government has been using various excuses to postpone the withdrawal. Today, 45,000 French troops continue to be stationed in Tunisia, constituting a de facto military control that prevents Tunisia from exercising its full sovereignty.

    For a country to achieve complete independence, it must also eliminate the forces of imperialism in the economic sphere and develop its own national economy. In this regard, the Tunisian people will still face difficult struggles. Currently, French colonists still occupy one-fifth of Tunisia's arable land; French trusts owning agricultural product storage and processing facilities control the entire agricultural economy of Tunisia. Of the 254 enterprises with more than 50 workers, 213 are owned by French capitalists. Mineral resources are also mainly controlled by French monopoly capital. Tunisia's economic lifeline is almost entirely manipulated by the three major French banks of Rothschild, Mirabaud, and Mallet. French capitalists control three-quarters of the Tunisian market, creating a huge trade deficit in Tunisia's foreign trade through differences in the quantity and price of imports and exports, hindering the independent development of Tunisia's economy. French colonialists are trying to maintain this position in the Tunisian economy and manipulate Tunisia's economic activities; moreover, they are far from prepared to let Tunisia get rid of its status as an economic appendage of France.

    In addition to the old colonial forces that still need to be eliminated, the Tunisian people also face a new threat, namely, the neo-colonialism from across the Atlantic under the banner of the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

    The neo-colonialism produced by the United States differs somewhat from the old colonial methods of the 16th century. They no longer rob openly, but raise the banner of anti-Soviet and anti-communist, and wave shiny gold coins in their hands, pretending to be "protectors" and "benefactors" of small and weak countries, enter the house, and then take over as masters.

    Since Tunisia's independence, the United States has shown great interest in it. For example, in March last year, less than a week after Tunisia's independence, U.S. Senator Mansfield suggested that the government "make every necessary effort" to invite Tunisia to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The U.S. diplomatic mission in Tunisia was immediately "greatly strengthened." Not long ago, U.S. foreign aid chief Hollister said that after the Eisenhower Doctrine is passed, "priority will be given to the issue of aid to Morocco, Tunisia, and Afghanistan." Now, the U.S. dispatched investigation team is studying Tunisia's "foreign aid needs," and "if a conclusion is reached, a large amount of aid will be given." U.S. Vice President Nixon, who is currently traveling across the African continent after attending Ghana's independence ceremony, also flew to Tunisia on the 18th and, according to Eisenhower's instructions, will "discuss the goals and problems of this country" with the Tunisian King and government officials.

    The interest of the United States is by no means accidental, which is self-evident. Tunisia's geographical location makes it a "strategic area of paramount importance" in the eyes of Washington's strategic planners who are establishing the U.S. world hegemony. Although the United States had already acquired the right to establish military bases in Tunisia in 1950 through the Franco-American military agreement, this is clearly not enough for the United States. There have been reports that some are contemplating the possibility of organizing a North African Federation including Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria. The background of this "federation" plan gives reason to believe that Washington is trying to take advantage of the opportunity of the French colonialists being gradually driven out of North African countries to "fill the vacuum" there, while dividing the Arab countries to weaken their unity.

    Not long ago, Senator Green, chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, published his report on his visit to Africa. He believes that Tunisia's future is "full of hope," and as long as the new country is given the necessary "encouragement," Tunisia will be "able to exert a beneficial influence in North Africa." It can be seen that Washington's strategic planners have already arranged a role in their strategic plans for this country that has just gained independence and has not had time to stand firm.

    The Tunisian people now need to continue the struggle against French colonial rule to the end, striving for complete sovereignty, on the one hand; and resist the expansion of U.S. neo-colonialist forces and eliminate the vested interests of imperialism from within the country, on the other. This is a long-term, complex, and arduous struggle. But it is believed that no matter how rugged and difficult the road is, the Tunisian people, who have a history of three-quarters of a century of anti-colonialist struggle and finally achieved victory, will certainly be able to consolidate the results they have already achieved and move forward along the path of independent development.

### 突尼斯独立发展的道路

    突尼斯独立发展的道路
    萧光
    突尼斯走上独立发展的道路，已经整整一年了。
    一年前的今天，法国和突尼斯签署了一项联合议定书，宣布法国承认突尼斯的独立。当无数面鲜红的半月亮和星星的国旗，在北非正中这块突出伸入地中海的菱形土地上升起的时候，突尼斯全国欢喜若狂了。老年人流下了幸福的眼泪；年青的突尼斯人在“法国保护政权”的遗址跟前狂舞起来。儒勒·费利大道、巴黎大道的铜牌换上了独立运动中的英雄和烈士的名字；公用建筑的招牌、布告、邮戳由法文改成了阿拉伯文；殖民先驱者的塑像被纷纷推倒；“独立了！”的标语，到处出现在粉墙上……
    突尼斯人民从他们庆祝独立那天起，就着手清除法国殖民统治的遗痕，加强他们经过数十年的艰苦斗争才赢得的独立。过去一年中间，在这方面已经取得了明显的成绩。
    法国人离开了突尼斯政府机关；突尼斯人接管了每一个警察岗哨；突尼斯收回了铁路管理权；“公共哈布”（仓库）被清算了，全部财产收归国有；对于突尼斯国民经济具有重要意义的水利和水力发电工程开始筹建；农业劳动者的工资提高了25％；一些封建的社交壁障和习尚逐渐被撤除；妇女们开始抛弃面纱，敞露着脸庞在街上行走……。在政治制度上也采取了某些民主的变革。七十五年来，突尼斯人第一次行使普选的权利，选出了突尼斯自己的立宪议会和政府。年龄超过二十一岁的知识妇女，也享有了投票权。
    在对外关系方面，突尼斯遵奉万隆会议的精神，和其他亚非国家在一起，执行和平和民族独立的政策，坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民反对法国殖民镇压的民族斗争。
    然而，在突尼斯独立发展的道路上，还布满着荆棘和障碍。法国虽然被迫承认了突尼斯的独立，却仍想尽可能保持它对突尼斯的控制，就像它对待摩洛哥一样。正是出于这种殖民主义的考虑，所以法国迄今未按照承认突尼斯独立的议定书，把全部殖民军撤离突尼斯的国土。突尼斯人民不断发出要求法国撤出军队的呼声，突尼斯政府也一再同法国政府正式进行谈判，但是法国政府一直用种种借口推委不撤。今天，四万五千名法国军队继续驻扎在突尼斯，构成一种实际上的军事控制，使突尼斯无法行使完整的主权。
    一个国家要达到完全的独立，还必须在经济上清除帝国主义的势力，发展本民族的经济。在这方面，突尼斯人民也还会有困难的斗争。目前，法国殖民者依然占有突尼斯可耕地的五分之一；拥有农产品贮藏和处理设备的法国托辣斯控制了突尼斯整个农业经济。在二百五十四个五十名以上工人的企业中，二百十三个为法国资本家所有。矿产资源也主要被法国垄断资本所掌握。突尼斯的经济命脉几乎全部操纵在法国洛希尔、米拉波和马雷三家大银行的手里。法国资本家控制着突尼斯四分之三的市场，以进出口货物数量上和价格上的差异，造成突尼斯对外贸易上巨大的逆差，阻碍突尼斯经济的独立发展。法国殖民者企图继续保持它在突尼斯经济中的这种地位，操纵突尼斯的经济活动；而且它远不准备让突尼斯摆脱作为法国经济附属体的地位。
    除了旧有的殖民势力还需要肃清，突尼斯人民还面临着一个新的威胁，那就是从大西洋对岸来的打着“艾森豪威尔主义”招牌的新殖民主义。
    美国出品的新殖民主义，手法和十六世纪的旧殖民方法有些不同。他们现在不是明火执仗地打劫，而是打起反苏反共的旗子，并且手里摇晃着亮光闪闪的金元，装作弱小国家的“保护人”和“布施者”的样子，登堂入室，然后就在那里当家作主起来。
    自从突尼斯独立以来，美国就一直对它表示出莫大的兴趣。例如，去年3月，突尼斯独立不到一星期，美国参议员曼斯菲尔德就建议政府“尽一切必要的努力”，邀请突尼斯参加北大西洋公约组织。美国在突尼斯的外交使团立即“大大加强”了。不久以前，美国援外负责人霍利斯特表示，艾森豪威尔主义通过后，“将优先考虑给摩洛哥、突尼斯和阿富汗以援助的问题。”现在，美国派出的考察团已在研究突尼斯的“外援需要”，“假如得出结论，就将给予大量援助。”最近参加了加纳独立典礼后，正在进行横越非洲大陆的旅行的美国副总统尼克松，也在18日飞到了突尼斯，并且按照艾森豪威尔的指示，将同突尼斯的国王及政府官员“讨论这个国家的目标和问题”。
    美国的兴趣并非出于偶然，这是不言而喻的。突尼斯的地理位置使得它在华盛顿的建立美国世界霸权的战略策划人眼中，成为一个“具有头等重要性的战略地区”。美国虽然早在1950年就利用法、美军事协定，取得了在突尼斯建立军事基地的权利，但这对美国来说显然是不能满足的。已经有消息说，有人在盘算组织一个包括利比亚、摩洛哥、突尼斯和阿尔及利亚等国的北非联邦的可能性。这种“联邦”计划的背景使人有理由估计，华盛顿正在设法利用法国殖民者被逐步赶出北非国家的机会到那里去“填补真空”，同时使阿拉伯国家分立门户，以便削弱它们的团结。
    不久以前，美国参议院外交委员会主席格林发表了他访问非洲的报告。他认为突尼斯的前途“大有希望”，只要给这个新国家以必要的“鼓励”，突尼斯就“能够在北非起有益的影响。”由此可见，华盛顿的战略策划人已经在他的战略计划中给这个才获得独立而还没有来得及站得很稳的国家安排了一个角色。
    突尼斯人民现在一方面需要继续把反对法国殖民统治的斗争进行到底，争取完整的主权；另一方面又要抵挡美国新殖民主义势力的扩张，并从国内肃清帝国主义的既得地盘。这是一场长期、复杂和艰巨的斗争。但是人们相信，不管道路如何崎岖和艰难，有了四分之三世纪反殖民主义斗争历史而终于获得胜利的突尼斯人民，一定能够最后巩固已经获得的成果，沿着独立发展的道路前进。
