Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: Minister of Education Zhang Xiruo delivered a special speech at the CPPCC National Committee plenary session this morning on the issues of enrollment and employment of middle and primary school graduates and the enrollment of school-age children. He said that the task of general education is to train reserves and successors for the country's socialist labor army. Currently, middle and primary school students should be ideologically prepared, and if they cannot continue their education after graduation, they should engage in industrial and agricultural production or other construction work.

Next to speak was Pabala, the Living Buddha of Qamdo. He said that since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Seventeen-Article Agreement has been implemented, strengthening and consolidating the unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities and within the Tibetan nationality, and various construction undertakings have also made great progress.

Li Wuqiu believes that increasing production and practicing economy should focus on the big picture and start with the small details. Attention should be paid to the three issues of eating, housing, and children's education.

Jia Yibin spoke today to the KMT military and government personnel in Taiwan, especially the young officers and soldiers, hoping that they would wake up, dispel their concerns, get rid of the control of American imperialism as soon as possible, and allow Taiwan to return to the embrace of the motherland at an early date.

Zhang Dongye, the vice mayor of Hefei City who attended the meeting as an observer, introduced the situation of agricultural cooperation in his hometown, Qianshan County.

Huang Wenxi, deputy director of the Beijing Institute of Water Conservancy Sciences, expressed satisfaction with the agreement reached by relevant departments on adjusting and merging water conservancy scientific research institutions.

Bao Guobao, deputy director of the Technical Committee of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, said that the growth rate of electricity generation should be appropriately proportional to the growth of total industrial output value. This experience is worth paying attention to when formulating the Second Five-Year Plan.

Deng Jixing, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, suggested that another population survey be conducted during next year's elections in order to find out the law of population development as a basis for determining population policies.

Wu Zhibiao, a teacher at Jiamusi Agricultural School who attended the meeting as an observer, said that the importance of fine varieties in production should be widely publicized in rural areas, and efforts should be made to formulate seed grades according to scientific methods and strengthen seed quarantine work.

Ten people also made written speeches this morning.
