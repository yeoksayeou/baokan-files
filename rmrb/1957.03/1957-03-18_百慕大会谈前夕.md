On the Eve of the Bermuda Summit
	Yuan Xianlu
Eisenhower and Macmillan will begin talks on March 21st. Bermuda, a small British colony near the United States, was chosen as the venue for the talks. Some American news agencies said ingratiatingly that this showed Eisenhower's "special consideration" for the British "ally"—so as not to give the impression that the British Prime Minister had to "queue up" with other visitors to Washington when meeting with the American President.

Washington's "condescension" is somewhat ironic for London. In the nine-plus weeks from the ceasefire in the invasion of Egypt to the reorganization of the British cabinet, then-British Prime Minister Eden repeatedly knocked on the White House door, hoping to get some support from the American "ally"; however, Washington consistently ignored him, with extreme coldness. Uncle Sam was clearly admonishing the gentlemen at 10 Downing Street that unilateral actions like launching the invasion of Egypt were not permissible. Washington's expression only turned pleasant after Macmillan succeeded Eden as British Prime Minister. But American newspapers and news agencies bluntly announced the White House's view of Anglo-American relations. The Associated Press wrote: Eden's downfall "dramatically heralded the end of an era in British history as a great power." The "Washington Post and Times Herald" put it even more bluntly: In the new Anglo-American "alliance," Britain's role would be that of a "submissive executor of American will." The newspaper even warned: "If the British try to count too strongly on restoring their traditional ties with the Americans, there will be many difficulties in the future."

Washington's arrogant attitude is not exactly new to London. But after all, the gentlemen of the British Empire are not willing to completely give up their identity. Therefore, Macmillan specifically stated in his inaugural speech: "Let us hear no more of talk about second-class nations and fearful things to come"; "genuine partnership is founded on respect," "we do not intend to part company with the Americans, nor do we intend to be a satellite state."

Washington believes that London should be content to act as a "submissive executor of American will," while London demands to be an equal partner with the United States. With the implementation of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," the long-standing contradictions between the two partners in the Anglo-American "alliance" have developed particularly sharply. Although both sides of the Atlantic are now busy hanging up posters of "friendship" and "unity" for the Bermuda summit, people expect a fierce struggle in this meeting.

The Middle East issue is currently the focus of Anglo-American contradictions. As early as the Anglo-American Washington talks at the end of January last year, the Middle East issue was a top priority. At that time, the Baghdad Pact was strongly opposed by Arab countries, and Britain urgently hoped that the United States would also join it in order to reduce the pressure it was under. But Washington believed that letting the British partner alone bear the brunt of the anti-colonialist wave in the Middle East countries would be more conducive to its own gains. As a result, in that meeting, in addition to the United States vaguely expressing "firm support for the purposes and tasks" of the Baghdad Pact, no joint Middle East policy that Britain requested could be established.

After this meeting, which was also declared to be one of "unity," Washington watched gleefully as its partner across the ocean continued to suffer blows to its influence in the Middle East. British General Glubb was driven out of Jordan, and the British occupation forces in the Suez region withdrew sadly from Egyptian territory… Britain's colonial position in the Middle East was increasingly weakened. The United States took the opportunity to expand its influence more and more through hypocritical double-dealing tactics. This situation prompted the British Conservative Party newspaper "Daily Mail" to complain bitterly on April 4 last year: "American power has… pushed us out of Egypt and weakened our position in Jordan and Iran… Whenever the United States acts, it is often against Britain."

After Egypt announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, the gentlemen in London were furious. And what about Washington? It used the situation like "a magician playing with his top hat," as the West German "Der Spiegel" magazine said. At the time, some Western newspapers exposed the secrets of the trick played by this "magician"—creating a second Iran incident in Egypt, transferring the interests of Britain and France in the Suez to the accounts of the United States.

The disingenuous maneuvering of this partner across the Atlantic has caused Britain a great headache. Together with its French partner across the Channel, it conspired with Israel to suddenly launch the invasion of Egypt. It wanted to change the situation in Egypt and regain control of the Suez region before the United States could take countermeasures. However, London underestimated the anti-colonialist strength of the people of the Arab countries and the international support their just struggle could obtain. The military adventure quickly met with failure. As the British lion sat down to lick its wounds, Uncle Sam, under the guise of a "peace envoy," began a full-scale advance into the British and French spheres of influence in the Middle East.

Some American newspapers were so overjoyed that they became delirious, cheering: "British power in the Middle East is finished! We must fill the vacuum left behind." The United States, accustomed to expanding through the North Atlantic Treaty, announced at the North Atlantic Council in December last year that the Middle East did not belong to the North Atlantic region and that the United States reserved the right to take unilateral action. Soon, Washington announced the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to "fill the vacuum in the Middle East," and the United States proclaimed itself the "protector" of the Middle Eastern countries.

In fact, the focus of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is not only the Middle East. According to the White House's geographical concept, the Middle East region can include Africa. Recently, American diplomatic missions in Africa have been generally strengthened. The "Voice of America" has expanded its radio propaganda to Africa. After Nixon attended the independence ceremony in Ghana, which had just emerged from British colonial rule, he also "casually" made "visits that were far more than ceremonial" (Eisenhower's words) to many African countries. Wall Street has long coveted the abundant resources and manpower of the African continent. It is now time to further exploit the generally rising anti-colonialist wave there to begin pushing the British and French colonialists out of their last colonial stronghold. The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee recently made it clear in a report on African surveys that the United States must not abandon Africa, this "continent reserved by God as a reserve," and therefore must take on leadership responsibilities in the African region.

In other regions, Washington has not let go of opportunities either. On February 2, United Press reporter Gallard wrote: "The loss of bases in the Suez Canal area and Ceylon makes Britain's bases in Asia increasingly unreliable… A conference to discuss Singapore's autonomy will be held this March, and Malaya will gain full independence in August… These changes will prompt an increase in American responsibilities in the region." On March 4, an American official body suggested establishing a "common market" chaired by the United States in Asia and South America. These have made London feel uneasy.

Of course, although the British Empire is already declining, it is not without the power to fight back. Although the Suez Crisis forced Britain to rely on American oil aid and loans to overcome the difficulties, Britain's economic strength has indeed been strengthened considerably in recent years. And London knows that in the world struggle against socialist countries and against the independent movements of various countries, the United States still needs to rely on British support in many areas. Therefore, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Thorneycroft warned the United States in a speech "not to underestimate the fundamental strength of Britain," "the damage that our two countries can inflict on each other may be greater than the damage that any third party can inflict on us." Foreign Secretary Lloyd, while expressing "welcome" to the Eisenhower Doctrine, also declared that Britain would reserve the right to take independent action in the Middle East.

To strengthen its economic position, Britain is making many plans, including reducing troops stationed in West Germany and establishing a "free trade area," etc. In London's view, these plans can be regarded as "trump cards" in dealing with the United States.

But since London has allowed Washington to put a noose around its neck, the weight of these "trump cards" is highly questionable. Washington has long seen the weaknesses in British foreign policy. Dulles pointed out rather confidently in a secret memorandum submitted to Eisenhower last December that, due to Britain's traditional anti-communist stance and its obligations to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the United States need not worry about Britain's attitude in the short term when expanding in the Near East and Africa.

In British bourgeois public opinion, there are also more accurate views. For example, the British "New Statesman and Nation" magazine once commented on Anglo-American relations in the following passage: "In the Cold War, Britain must rely on the United States; but in coexistence, Britain has independence, and in guiding the United States on the road to coexistence, Britain will play a decisive role." But has the British ruling group also drawn this conclusion from practical lessons? The Bermuda summit will be able to provide some clues.

    百慕大会谈前夕
    袁先禄
    艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦将在3月21日开始会谈。百慕大，英国在美国附近的一小块殖民地，被选为会谈的场所。美国的一些通讯社卖好地说，这表现了艾森豪威尔对英国“盟友”的“特殊照顾”——免得使人感到大英帝国的首相要和美国的总统会谈，也得到华盛顿同其他国家的访问者在一起“排队”。
    华盛顿的这种“赏光”，对伦敦说来，未免有点讽刺的意味。在侵埃战争停火到英国内阁改组的九个多星期中，当时的英国首相艾登曾经不止一次地紧叩白宫的大门，想从美国“盟友”那里得到一些支持；然而，华盛顿却一直不加理睬，冷淡得无以复加。山姆大叔显然是要训诫唐宁街十号的绅士们，像发动侵埃战争那样的擅自行动是不能容许的。麦克米伦接任艾登担任英国首相的职位以后，华盛顿才脸色转霁。但是美国的报刊和通讯社毫不客气地宣布白宫对于英美关系的看法。美联社写道：艾登的下台“戏剧性地宣告了英国历史上作为大国的一个时代的结束”。“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”说得更为露骨：在新的英美“联盟”中，英国的角色就是“美国意志的顺从执行者”。这家报纸甚至警告说：“如果英国人试图过于强烈地指望恢复同美国人的传统联系，今后将会发生很多困难。”
    华盛顿的这种傲慢态度，对伦敦说来，倒也不算什么新鲜。但是毕竟大英帝国的绅士还不甘心完全放弃他的身份。因此，麦克米伦在他的就职演说中特地表明态度说：“不要再谈二等国家和今后还要发生可怕的事情这样泄气的话”；“真正的伙伴关系是建立在尊重的基础上的”，“我们不打算和美国人分道扬镳，也不打算做附庸国”。
    华盛顿认为伦敦应当安于充当“美国意志的顺从执行者”，而伦敦要求成为美国的一个地位相当的伙伴。随着“艾森豪威尔主义”的推行，英美“联盟”两位伙伴之间由来已久的矛盾发展得格外尖锐了。尽管现在大西洋两岸都在忙于为这次百慕大会谈张挂“友好”“团结”的招贴，但是人们都预期在这次会谈中会有一场激烈的斗争。
    中东问题，是目前英美矛盾的焦点。早在去年1月末美英华盛顿会谈中，中东问题就是一项最重要的议程。当时，巴格达条约受到阿拉伯国家强烈的反对，英国迫切希望美国也参加进去，以便减轻自己所受的压力。但是华盛顿却认为，让英国伙伴单独去承受中东国家反殖民主义浪潮的冲击，更有利于让自己从中渔利。结果，在那次会谈里，除了美国空泛地表示对巴格达条约的“目的和任务仍旧给以坚决的支持”以外，并没有能订出英国所要求的共同的中东政策。
    在这次也照例被宣布为“团结”的会谈举行以后，华盛顿得意地看着大洋彼岸的伙伴在中东的势力继续受到打击。英国将军格拉布被赶出约旦，在苏伊士地区的英国占领军黯然撤离埃及的领土……英国在中东的殖民地位越来越削弱了。美国却趁机用伪善的两面手法越来越多地扩展了自己的影响。这种情形使得英国保守党的报纸“每日邮报”在去年4月4日怨愤地大叫道：“美国的势力已经……把我们排挤出埃及并且削弱我们在约旦和伊朗的地位。……只要美国有所行动，那常常是反对英国的。”
    埃及宣布把苏伊士运河公司收归国有后，伦敦的绅士们暴跳如雷。而华盛顿呢？却如西德“明镜”周刊所说的，像“魔术师玩弄自己的大礼帽一样”，来利用这种局势。当时西方国家的一些报刊就戳穿了这位“魔术师”所玩的戏法的秘密——在埃及制造第二个伊朗事件，把英法在苏伊士的利益转到美国的账户上去。
    大西洋对岸这个伙伴的不怀好意的折冲，使英国大伤脑筋。它和海峡对岸的法国伙伴一起，同以色列共谋而突然发动侵埃战争。它想在美国还来不及采取对策之前，就改变埃及局势，重新控制苏伊士地区。但是，伦敦低估了阿拉伯国家人民反殖民主义的力量和他们的正义斗争所能得到的国际支援。军事冒险很快就遭到了失败。当不列颠的狮子坐下来吮舐自己的创口时，山姆大叔打着“和平使者”的幌子，就开始向中东的英法势力范围全面进军。
    一些美国的报刊高兴得得意忘形，他们欢呼：“英国在中东的势力完蛋了！我们必须填补遗留下来的真空。”惯于通过北大西洋公约来进行扩张的美国，在去年12月的北大西洋理事会上，却宣布中东不属于北大西洋地区，美国保留单独采取行动的权利。不久，华盛顿就宣布了“填补中东真空”的“艾森豪威尔主义”，把美国自封为中东各国的“保护人”。
    实际上，“艾森豪威尔主义”的着眼点还不只是中东。按照白宫的地理概念，中东地区可以包括非洲在内。最近，美国在非洲的外交机构普遍加强了。“美国之音”对非洲广播宣传扩大了。尼克松到刚刚摆脱英国殖民地地位的加纳参加独立典礼以后，又“顺便”到非洲很多国家进行“远不止是礼节上的访问”（艾森豪威尔语）。对于非洲大陆的丰富资源和人力，华尔街垂涎已久。进一步利用在那里普遍高涨中的反殖民主义浪潮，来着手把英法殖民主义者从他们这个最后的殖民堡垒排挤出去，现在是时候了。美国众议院外交委员会不久前在关于非洲考察的报告里就明白表示，美国决不能放弃非洲这块“上帝保留下来作为后备的大陆”，因此就必须在非洲地区负担起领导责任。
    在其它地区，华盛顿也没有放松机会。2月2日合众社记者加尔德写道：“由于丧失了在苏伊士运河区和锡兰的基地，使英国保持在亚洲的基地越发不可靠了。……今年3月将举行讨论新加坡自治的会议，8月，马来亚将获得完全的独立……这些变化将促使加重美国在这一地区的责任。”3月4日，美国一个官方机构提出意见，要在亚洲和南美洲建立由美国主持的“共同市场”。这些都使伦敦感到惴惴不安。
    当然，大英帝国虽然已经日薄西山，也还不是毫无还击的力量。尽管苏伊士危机使得英国不得不依靠美国的石油援助和贷款来渡过难关，然而英国的经济力量几年来毕竟也有不少的加强。而且伦敦知道，在反对社会主义国家和反对各国人民独立运动的世界斗争中，美国也还有许多地方需要借助英国的支持。所以英国财政大臣桑尼克罗夫特在一次演说中警告美国“不要低估了英国的基本力量”，“我们两国可能给予彼此的损害也许会比任何第三者所能给予我们的损害要大”。外交大臣劳埃德在表示“欢迎”艾森豪威尔主义的同时，又声明英国也要保留在中东采取独立行动的权利。
    为了加强自己经济实力地位，英国正作出多方面的规划，包括裁减驻西德的军队和建立“自由贸易区”等等。在伦敦看来，这些计划可以当作在同美国打交道时手里掌握的“王牌”。
    但是既然伦敦让华盛顿套住自己的脖子，这些“王牌”的份量是大可怀疑的。华盛顿早就看准了英国外交政策上的弱点。杜勒斯在去年12月提交艾森豪威尔的秘密备忘录里就颇为自信地指出，由于英国传统的反共立场和对北大西洋组织所承担的义务，美国在近东和非洲进行扩张时，短期内可以不必顾虑英国的态度。
    在英国资产阶级舆论中，也有看得较准的意见。例如英国“新政治家与民族”周刊去年评论英美关系时曾经说过下面一段话：“在冷战中，英国必须依赖美国；但在共处中，英国具有独立性，而且在指引美国走上共处的道路时，英国将起决定性的作用。”但是，英国统治集团是否也已经从实际的教训中得出这个结论呢？百慕大会谈将能够提供一点线索。
