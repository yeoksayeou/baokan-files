    Sichuan Opera "Forced Marriage"
    Ai Wu
    The emperor selecting beauties caused immense disturbance and disaster among the people. This is the first time I've seen this reflected in a literary work, and that is the Sichuan Opera "Forced Marriage." The content should be a tragedy, but wonderfully, it is expressed as a comedy. During the performance, the audience laughed and roared with laughter from beginning to end. The plot begins like this: the magistrate of Qiantang County receives an imperial envoy who says that the emperor wants to select three thousand beauties, and Qiantang County must provide eight hundred. If they fail to do so within three days, the magistrate will be beheaded. The magistrate is terrified, and even his wife is panicked, because they have an unmarried daughter themselves, and they should first think of a way for their daughter to escape the selection. Then, the magistrate immediately orders the people to offer up their daughters within three days. If they do not, they will be searched door to door. Families with daughters, seeing disaster looming, not only busy themselves with finding matchmakers, but also seize any man they see. In Wang Yuanwai's aria, the fear of the beauty selection felt by the general public is fully expressed: "If selected and brought into the palace, the palace gates are as deep as the sea. From then on, it will be difficult for family members to meet, and kinship will be severed with a single stroke." Scholar Li Yugang returns to the county and sees strange scenes along the way: "The roadside is full of lanterns and decorations, and the lanes and streets are filled with wedding processions. A wedding should be joyous, but why are there cries of sorrow everywhere? This matter is truly strange, why do joy and sorrow arrive together?" This realistically portrays the people's pain from Li Yu's perspective, mixed in with a false atmosphere of joy. Before Li Yu even reaches home, Wang Yuanwai, with a matchmaker, blocks his way and urges him to get married. When Li Yu refuses, they forcibly drag him to the wedding ceremony. Li Yu, extremely annoyed, seizes the opportunity to escape in the dark. He jumps over the wall and escapes into the neighbor's house. The neighbor's house is inhabited by a father and daughter who make a living by performing martial arts. The daughter, Zhang Caifeng, was harassed by the yamen runners during the day, who wanted her to be a concubine, and she is still angry. Her father, Zhang Xuan, went to the street to find a groom for his daughter, but unfortunately didn't find any and returns empty-handed, also full of anger. Suddenly, they hear a sound of someone jumping down. Zhang Caifeng thinks that the yamen runners have come to harass her again under the cover of darkness, and her father draws his sword to kill. In the end, they see that it is a scholar. The father is overjoyed, thinking that a groom has arrived without being sought. Li Yu had also seen Zhang Caifeng performing martial arts and had long admired her in secret. Zhang Caifeng had also seen Li Yu before and thought that his character was not bad. Thus, they both agree and proceed with the wedding ceremony. Although Li Yu has had the ceremony, he wants to inform his mother before truly getting married, so he goes home that night. Unfortunately, as soon as he reaches the street, he is dragged onto a boat by two yamen runners and a suona player (Li Yu's wedding with Wang Yuanwai's daughter and Zhang Caifeng was because he was temporarily grabbed to play music). On the boat sits an official, disguised as the county magistrate's wife. It turns out that the magistrate arranged this clever plan to find a groom for his daughter while avoiding public attention. The next day, Zhang Xuan takes his daughter Zhang Caifeng to Li Yu's house to get married, only to find that Li Yu is missing, which greatly surprises them. Zhang Caifeng immediately disguises herself as a warrior and goes out to inquire about Li Yu's whereabouts. Wang Yuanwai, seeing that Li Yu had escaped after the wedding ceremony, also comes to Li's house to find him and starts arguing with Zhang Xuan. Just then, the county magistrate arrives to inform Wang Yuanwai to go to the yamen as a matchmaker to complete the marriage of the magistrate's daughter, and to bring the newly married son-in-law as a guest. This is difficult for him. Fortunately, he meets a warrior on the road (Zhang Caifeng in disguise) and asks the warrior to temporarily act as the son-in-law. The warrior, having heard that Li Yu was taken to the yamen, gladly agrees. In the county yamen, just as the young lady is about to marry the groom Li Yu, Zhang Xuan, Li Yu's mother, and the matchmaker all come to file a complaint. It turns out that they couldn't find their son-in-law and son, so they went out calling along the street. The matchmaker, having lost her suona-playing son, also shouted along with them. On the street, they met a drunken runner who lied that Li Yu had fallen into the river and died while trying to avoid the forced marriage. They were extremely saddened and went to the yamen to file a complaint. Once in the court, Wang Yuanwai, Zhang Xuan, and even the county magistrate's wife all fight over Li Yu to be their son-in-law, which makes it difficult for the magistrate. If he gives Li Yu to himself as a son-in-law, he fears stirring up public anger. If he gives him to Zhang Xuan or Wang Yuanwai, his wife will not agree. In the end, the imperial envoy appears and asks Li Yu and Zhang Caifeng their intentions, and lets them get married. Then, he explains that there are still two beauties short, and orders the magistrate and Wang Yuanwai to immediately offer their daughters to make up the number of eight hundred. The story ends with the audience's laughter. But after the laughter, a bitter taste remains in the heart. Because the whole background is permeated with a tragic atmosphere of tension. Young men fear forced marriage and dare not walk on the streets, and young women fear being searched and cannot sit still at home. Apart from Li Yu and Zhang Caifeng's happy marriage, many young men and women are forced to marry, causing great mistakes. In addition, those who are not selected for marriage are forcibly snatched and sent to the palace, which is even more tragic. Bai Juyi's "Song of Everlasting Regret" writes that after Yang Yuhuan gained the emperor's favor, the world valued daughters over sons. "Forced Marriage" reflects the opposite, showing the people's hatred of beauty pageants, and it truly represents the people's minds, which is very valuable.
    The script is tightly structured, and each character has its own personality. With the performance of talented actors, the plot seems reasonable and delicate and vivid. Some of the main characters, such as Li Yu (played by Luo Yuzhong) and Zhang Caifeng (played by Yuan Shu), have prominent personalities and leave a deep impression. Li Yu doesn't want the daughters of officials and rich people, but insists on marrying the girl he loves. Zhang Caifeng is determined to resist being selected into the palace, even if it means resorting to violence and bloodshed. This is very lovely. The other minor characters are also unforgettable. Like the old eunuch who plays the imperial envoy (played by Chen Yumen), who has very few scenes in the play, only appearing twice, but when he sits in the hall, he issues the imperial decree for the beauty pageant and then orders the magistrate confusedly: "Everyone go back to your yamen if you have nothing to do." Confused the magistrate. The follower quietly tells him: "Your Eminence, this is not the capital." He then understands that it is he who should leave, so he asks people to help him into the sedan. Before he even sits down properly, he is already snoring loudly. How can the audience not laugh? Another example is a suona player (played by Tang Yunfeng) who is only dragged to play wedding music, which doesn't seem important, but every time he appears to play music or speak, people can't help but laugh. Because he was also dragged to play music by force. He says to the person who dragged him: "No, no, the manpower is not complete, we can't play properly." The person who dragged him says: "This world doesn't care about whether the playing is complete or not. As long as there is a suona blowing, let the neighbors know that my family is marrying a daughter." The suona player says: "I can't play well alone." The person who dragged him says: "As long as it's the suona of a wedding musician, not the ox horn of a Taoist priest, then everything will be fine." In this way, during the wedding, he alone plays the suona in a strange voice, which cannot help but give a sense of comedy. Like Li Yu's first forced wedding with Wang Yuanwai's daughter, people are singing loudly: "A hundred years of lovebirds, meeting coincidentally today." The suona player suddenly says innocently: "Hey, if you estimate the wrong wedding, that's really weird!" The most touching point is that he was dragged away by the county magistrate's wife, who feared that he would leak the news, and he was not allowed to go home, nor was he allowed to continue his profession as a musician, but only to be a book boy for the new son-in-law. He was extremely sad and tearfully said: "I can't change my profession, I love this suona for the rest of my life."
    In terms of the lyrics, some are quite poetic, such as Zhang Caifeng's singing "I fear that after falling into the palace, I will sit and watch the falling flowers turn white," which is very beautiful and expresses the true feelings of a girl fearing selection. Also, such as singing "Whoever dares to rob my daughter, I will let him dye the streets red with blood." Her father sings: "My daughter is worthy of my family, born with a hard bone, if forced, she will become an outlaw in the mountains, and burn the city with a fire of sorrow." It can also fully express people's character. As for the dialogue, many are full of humor. Like when two yamen runners are dragging Li Yu to be a groom, Li Yu says in fear: "I am a good person." The runners reply loudly: "We specialize in taking good people." This answer is very realistic. If you don't take good people, how can you be worthy of being the county magistrate's son-in-law? But it makes people laugh non-stop.
    On the evening of February 11, 1957, I watched the first rehearsal of this script in Beijing. After watching it, I felt that there are also such outstanding comedies in our Chinese classical dramas, which cannot but make me feel very happy. This script, whether in terms of ideology or art, should receive the highest evaluation. Some writers who had finished watching "Forced Marriage" solemnly expressed their feelings at the symposium, saying: "This surpasses Molière's comedy." Some also suggested that it be made into a movie.
    The play "Forced Marriage" has probably not been performed for many years. Some old researchers of Sichuan opera say: "This is the first time I've seen it." In 1956, the repertoire was appraised in Chengdu and deemed to be one of the excellent traditional repertoires of Sichuan opera, and was then reorganized and performed again. Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new, and today we have reaped another good harvest.

    川剧“拉郎配”
    艾芜
    皇帝选美女，在民间引起极大的骚扰和灾难，反映在文艺作品里面，我还第一次看见，这就是川剧“拉郎配”。内容应该是悲剧，可是妙得很，却用喜剧表现出来。演出的时候，观众自始至终不断地发出大笑和哄笑。剧情是这样开始的：钱塘县官迎接到一位钦差大臣，说是皇帝要选美女三千，钱塘县派选八百，限令三天之内办到，办不到就得斩首。县官吓坏了，连夫人也恐慌万分，因为他们自己就有一个未嫁的女儿，首先便该为自己的女儿想出逃选的办法。接着县官立刻下令人民，三天之内献出女儿，如不献出，就要挨门挨户搜查。有女的人家看见大祸临头，不只忙找媒婆，还见男子就拉。在王员外的唱词中，充分表现出了一般人怕选美的心情：“倘若被选把宫进，宫门一入似海深。从此家人难见面，一刀割断骨肉情。”秀才李玉刚回县来，一路上看见了奇异的情景，“路边上尽都在张灯结彩，迎亲的塞满了小巷大街，办喜事就应该欢欢快快，却为何四处里哭声哀哀。这事儿真叫人有些奇怪，缘何苦与乐一齐到来。”这从李玉的眼中真实地写出了人民的辛酸，是在虚假的欢乐空气中混合着的。李玉还未到家，就被王员外带着媒婆，把他挡住，劝他成亲，李玉不肯，便强迫拉去拜堂。李玉气恼已极，便黑夜乘机逃走。翻过墙去，逃进隔壁人家。隔壁人家里面住着父女两人，都是跑江湖卖武艺的。女儿张彩凤，白天才被衙门差人调戏过，要她作妾，正在气恼。父亲张宣到街上去跟女儿拉郎，不幸一个也没拉着，空手而回，也是一肚皮气。忽然听见有人跳下的声音，张彩凤认为衙门差人又趁黑夜来扰，父亲便按剑去杀。结果看出是一个秀才，父亲喜出望外，认为新郎不拉自到。李玉也因看见过张彩凤卖艺，早就私心爱慕，同时张彩凤先前也见过李玉，认为人品不坏，这一来两相情愿，就行拜堂。李玉虽然拜了堂，但要禀明母亲，才肯真正成婚，便当夜回家。不幸一到街上，就被衙门两个差役，连同一个吹唢呐的（李玉同王员外的女儿和张彩凤拜堂都是临时抓他来奏乐）拉上船去。船上坐着一位官员，就是县官的夫人装扮的。原来县官为女儿拉郎，要避人耳目，才设下这条妙计。第二天张宣带女儿张彩凤到李玉家去成亲，发现李玉失踪，大为吃惊。张彩凤便马上化装成为武士，出去打听李玉下落。王员外因见李玉拜堂后，即行逃走，这时也来李家寻找，就同张宣争吵起来。恰好县官来一通知，要王员外到衙门去作媒人，为县官的小姐完婚，并要他把新婚的女婿带去作客。这可难着他了，幸得路上遇着一位武士（即张彩凤装的），就请武士暂时作下女婿。武士刚好风闻李玉拉去衙门，便欣然答允。在县衙门里小姐快要与拉来的新郎李玉成婚的时候，张宣和李玉的妈以及媒婆都来告状来了。原来他们看见女婿儿子无法找着，便出来沿街呼唤，媒婆因为失落了吹唢呐的儿子，也跟着一道叫喊。在街上碰见吃醉了的差役谎说李玉昨夜逃避拉郎，误跌江中，业已身死，他们听了悲痛已极，便到衙门告状。一到堂上，王员外、张宣以至县官夫人都争李玉来做女婿，这可难坏县官了。要把李玉断给自己做女婿又怕激起民愤，要断给张宣或王员外呢？夫人又不答允。最后由钦差出场问明李玉和张彩凤的心意，就让他们结婚。接着就说明，美女尚少二名，要县官和王员外立即献出女儿凑够八百之数。故事即在观众大笑声中收场。但笑了之后，却有一种苦味留在心里。因为整个背景，都是弥漫着悲惨的紧张气氛。男青年怕拉郎，不敢街上走，女青年怕搜查，在家也坐立不安。除了李玉和张彩凤婚姻美满而外，好多男女青年被迫成亲，铸成大错。另外没有拉到郎的，生抢活拉，选入宫去，更是悲惨。白居易的长恨歌，写出杨玉环得到皇帝的宠爱，天下便重生女不重生男。拉郎配却是作了另外的反映，表现出了人民痛恨选美的心情，而且是真正代表了人民的心意，这是非常可贵的。
    这个剧本结构紧凑，里面每个人物都具有个性，再经有才能的演员们演出，显得剧情合情合理，又很细腻生动。一些主要人物如李玉 （罗玉中饰）张彩凤（袁树饰）等，都有突出的性格，给人印象很深。李玉不要官家和有钱人的女儿，偏要和心爱的姑娘成亲。张彩凤决心抗拒选入宫去，即使动武流血，也在所不惜。这是非常可爱的。其余次要的人物，也使人难以忘记。像做钦差的老太监（陈禹门饰），在剧中戏很少，只出场两下，但他坐在大堂上，一颁布完选美的圣旨就昏愦地命令县官：无事各自回衙去。弄得县官莫明其妙。跟随人悄悄对他说：老千岁这不是京城里。他才明白，原该他走，便叫人扶着升轿。还未坐好，就鼾声大作，观众怎能不笑？又像一个吹唢呐的 （唐云峰饰）只是被人拉去奏结婚乐曲，似乎并不重要，但每一出场奏乐或者讲话，都叫人无法不笑。因为他也是被拉去强迫奏乐。他向被拉的人说：“不行，不行，人手不齐，吹打不起。”拉的人说：“这个世道还讲甚么吹打齐不齐呵。只要有只唢呐吹上一吹，让左邻右舍晓得我家在嫁女就行了。”吹唢呐的说：“我一个人吹得不好呵。”拉的人说：“只要吹的是吹鼓手的唢呐，不是端公的牛角，道士的海螺，那就万事大吉。”这样一来，成亲的时候，就他一人怪声怪气，吹下唢呐，不能不令人有滑稽之感。又像李玉第一次被迫与王员外女儿拜堂，人家正在大声唱礼：“百年偕鸾凤，今日巧相逢。”吹唢呐的忽然天真地喊道：“嘿，估倒拜堂，这才怪哟！”最感动人的一点，是他被县官夫人拉去，怕他走漏消息，不许他回家，也不许他再干奏乐的职业，只要他作新女婿的书童，他难过极了，声泪俱下地说：我不能改行，我一辈子就爱这个唢呐。
    在唱词方面有些颇富有诗意，如张彩凤唱的“怕的是身落宫廷后，坐看落花白了头”，很是优美，又表现出了少女怕选的真实心情。又如唱“谁人敢来抢儿走，叫他血染大街头”。她父亲唱：“女儿不愧我家后，生就一副硬骨头，逼急了上山当草寇，一把火烧得满城愁。”又能充分表现人的性格。至于对话，有好多富于幽默的。像两个衙门差人拉李玉做新郎的时候，李玉就恐惧地说：“我是好人”。差人大声回答：“我们就是专拿好人的。”这回答得很真实，不拿好人，怎么配做县官的女婿。可是就令人大笑不置。
    1957年2月11日晚上在北京第一次彩排这个剧本，我看了之后，觉得我们中国的古典戏剧中，原来也有这样很杰出的喜剧，不能不使我感到很大的欢喜。这个剧本无论在思想上艺术上，都应当得到最高的评价。一些看完“拉郎配”的作家同志，在座谈会上，郑重地发表感想说：“这要赛过莫里哀的喜剧”。有的还建议拍摄成电影。
   “拉郎配”这个剧，大概好些年没有演了。一些老研究川戏的人说：“这还是第一次看见。”1956年在成都进行剧目鉴定，认为这是川剧的优秀传统剧目之一，才重新整理上演起来。百花齐放，推陈出新，今天又得到了一个很好的收获。
