Persist in Carrying Out the Advanced Producer Movement

The main task of the workers across the country at present is to increase production and practice economy, so as to ensure the comprehensive and over-fulfillment of this year's plan and the first Five-Year Plan, and to prepare good conditions for the second Five-Year Plan. The most effective way to achieve the goal of increasing production and practicing economy is to persist in carrying out the advanced producer movement.

However, some people say that, driven by the upsurge of socialist transformation last year, the inventory of raw materials was relatively abundant, the tasks of capital construction and industrial production were sufficient, workers generally increased their wages, and welfare undertakings were generally improved. The enthusiasm for carrying out the advanced producer movement was very high, and the achievements were great. This year, the upsurge of cooperativization and socialist transformation has passed, capital construction and industrial production are facing difficulties in raw materials, some factories and construction and installation enterprises have insufficient production tasks, and wages and welfare expenses are generally not increased. Can the advanced producer movement still be carried out?

Yes, last year's socialist transformation upsurge promoted the socialist emulation upsurge on the industrial front, and the advanced producer movement was carried out vigorously. This year, agriculture and handicrafts have been basically cooperativized, and private industrial and commercial enterprises have also been basically incorporated into the state plan through industry-wide joint state-private ownership. The upsurge of socialist transformation has passed. However, after the test of last year's large-scale production and after the rectification last winter and this spring, agriculture is carrying out a production increase movement to strive for a bumper harvest this year, which will inevitably promote the continued advancement of industrial production. It is not difficult to imagine that if agricultural products have a bumper harvest this year, the vast number of peasants will exchange more agricultural products for industrial products than in the past. If the industrial sector does not carry out the advanced producer movement, and does not mobilize workers to think of all possible ways, including economical methods, to increase production, then what will be used to exchange with the peasants?

Indeed, due to the insufficient supply of raw materials, some factories and construction and installation enterprises may have the problem of insufficient production tasks this year. But we should see that, from the perspective of the whole country, the production tasks of the vast majority of industrial and mining enterprises and construction and installation enterprises are still very heavy. Precisely because raw materials are difficult to obtain, those industrial sectors that produce raw materials should persist in carrying out the advanced producer movement to increase production of more industrial raw materials to supply the user departments. Those industrial sectors that use raw materials, especially those enterprises that have insufficient production tasks due to lack of raw materials, should carry out the advanced producer movement, strive to improve product quality, and save raw materials to increase production while ensuring product quality. Some enterprises with insufficient production tasks can also reduce losses from downtime by mobilizing the masses to find substitutes, trial-produce and produce new products, carry out machine and equipment maintenance, and take on temporary jobs in the advanced producer movement. And for all industrial enterprises, to achieve the goals of improving technology, improving product quality, improving labor productivity, and reducing costs, persisting in carrying out the advanced producer movement is an effective method.

Since there was a relatively large increase in wages and welfare expenses last year, and there are certain difficulties in finance and material supply this year, the state will generally not increase the expenditure on wages and welfare expenses this year. However, as everyone knows, the wages and welfare expenses of our country's workers are gradually increased on the basis of production development. Now, carrying out the advanced producer movement and doing everything possible to increase production and practice economy is laying a solid material foundation for future increases in wages and welfare expenses. Therefore, it is very necessary to persist in carrying out the advanced producer movement.

Persisting in carrying out the advanced producer movement to achieve the goal of increasing production and practicing economy is not only necessary, but also possible. For example, after investigation and research, Dalian Shipyard found that within the enterprise, units using the same equipment and doing the same work generally have differences between the advanced and the backward. The material consumption of each of the five newly built 1,200-horsepower tugboats varies greatly. Among them, the No. 13 and No. 14 ships exceeded the material consumption quota by 31.5 tons for steel plates alone, while the No. 15 ship reduced it by one ton compared with the quota. If they mobilize the backward to catch up with the advanced, they can save a lot of materials to increase production. In fact, the advanced producer movement in many enterprises has continued to be carried out this year, and has achieved great results. For example, the miners of the Dagushan Iron Mine of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, braving the severe cold, produce in the open air or in the pits. As a result of their persistence in carrying out the advanced producer movement, they overfulfilled the ore production plan by 20,060 tons in January this year, and the total monthly output increased by 229,000 tons compared with the same period last year. Another example is the Weinan Oil and Electricity Plant in Shaanxi Province, which had not completed its production plan in the past two years. In December last year, it launched an advanced producer movement and conscientiously promoted advanced experiences such as "thorough steaming and good frying" and "replacing the pressing screw." As a result, it overfulfilled the January plan by 1.47%, the oil yield of cottonseed increased from 14.75% to 15.6%, the refining rate increased to 92%, and safe operation was also guaranteed. From this, it can be seen that the view that there is no need or no way to persist in carrying out the advanced producer movement this year, and that there is not much to gain from increasing production and practicing economy is wrong.

In order to do everything possible to increase production and practice economy and overfulfill this year's national plan, we must learn from last year's experience and persist in carrying out the advanced producer movement. In last year's advanced producer movement, the atmosphere of helping each other and learning from each other has been formed, and many enterprises have widely signed mutual assistance contracts between factories, between workers and staff, and between workers and workers, truly achieving the degree of teaching what one has and learning what one lacks. In this way, the unity of workers has been further strengthened, a large number of ordinary producers have reached the level of advanced producers, and advanced producers have been promoted to be more advanced. This needs to be continued to be promoted. However, last year, some units paid more attention to the advanced and the backward, and did not pay enough attention to the vast number of ordinary producers, so not many advanced collectives were produced. Therefore, in the future, while paying attention to the advanced and the backward, we also need to pay attention to the vast number of ordinary producers, so that they can catch up with the advanced and improve together, and strive for the emergence of more advanced teams, advanced workshops, and advanced enterprises, so that the overall production level can be improved further. The number of advanced producers is constantly changing, and there is no need to mechanically require that they all reach a certain percentage.

Summarizing and promoting advanced experience and carrying out rationalization proposals are the central links in overcoming formalism in the advanced producer movement, and also the central links in increasing production and practicing economy. In the selection of advanced producers and the convening of representative meetings of advanced producers last year, various industries concentrated the existing advanced experiences of various enterprises and promoted them nationwide, which achieved good results. However, in the process of promoting advanced experience, some units blindly promoted it without appraisal and regardless of the equipment conditions and technical level of the unit, so the effect was not great, and even caused waste. When some units promoted advanced experience, they only paid attention to improving labor productivity, but did not pay attention to reducing the labor intensity of workers, so it could not last. Therefore, in the future, it is necessary to clarify whether a certain advanced experience should be promoted, depending on whether it can solve the key problems in the production of the enterprise, and it must not be blindly promoted regardless of the actual conditions of the enterprise. At the same time, the advanced experience to be promoted must be conducive to improving workers' working conditions and reducing workers' labor intensity. It is not allowed to increase production and practice economy by damaging the health of workers and other unsafe methods. Although the work of rationalization proposals has been greatly developed last year, many units still have not put forward topics aimed at the weak links in production. In the future, it is necessary to continue to tap the technical wealth of the masses and concentrate the wisdom of the masses on the key problems in the enterprise. Whether in the promotion of advanced experience or in the development of rationalization proposals, it is hoped that the enterprise administration will give strong support in the testing of materials. It is also hoped that the superior economic leading organs of the enterprise will provide certain convenience to the enterprise in this regard.

Strengthening leadership is the decisive factor in persisting in carrying out the advanced producer movement. Last year, the advanced producer movement was able to gradually deepen and achieve great results, mainly because the party committees at all levels directly led it, and the enterprise administrations were able to actively participate in the leadership of this work together with the trade unions. However, some regions and units were only satisfied with the superficial hustle and bustle, mechanically requiring the numbers of advanced producers, and some units were only satisfied with the exchanges between factories, and relaxed the leadership of the team competition work. In the future, it is hoped that the enterprise leaders can conduct in-depth and meticulous ideological and political work and organizational work, especially to mobilize the personnel of the sections to go deep into the workshops to help the workers overcome various difficulties in increasing production and practicing economy, and to effectively ensure the successful completion of the production plan. In order to achieve this goal, the sectional competition also needs to be widely launched.

At present, many factories and mining enterprises are studying how to increase production and practice economy, but the leading comrades of some units are still only planning in the office. After planning, they always feel that there are many difficulties, but they have not brought the plan to the masses at all. This approach is not good. It is hoped that the enterprise leaders will quickly hand over the plan to the masses for discussion, and mobilize the masses to carry out the advanced producer movement, and do everything possible to increase production and practice economy.

### 把先进生产者运动坚持开展下去

    把先进生产者运动坚持开展下去
    全国职工当前的主要任务是增产节约，以保证全面地超额地完成今年的计划和第一个五年计划，并为第二个五年计划准备下良好的条件。要达到增产节约的目的，最有效的方法是坚持开展先进生产者运动。
    可是，有人说，去年在社会主义改造高潮的推动下，库存原材料比较丰富，基本建设和工业生产的任务充足，职工普遍增加了工资，福利事业也普遍有所改进，开展先进生产者运动的劲头很足，成绩也大。今年，合作化和社会主义改造高潮已经过去了，基本建设和工业生产的原材料有困难，一些工厂和建筑安装企业生产任务不足，工资和福利费用也一般地不增加了，先进生产者运动还能够坚持开展下去吗？
    是的，去年的社会主义改造高潮，推动了工业战线上的社会主义竞赛高潮，先进生产者运动就轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。今年，农业和手工业已经基本上合作化了，私营工商业也已经基本上经过全行业的公私合营而纳入国家计划轨道了，社会主义改造高潮是过去了。但是，经过去年大生产的考验和经过去年冬天和今年春天的整顿以后，农业方面正在开展一个争取今年大丰收的增产运动，它势必也要推动着工业生产继续前进。不难想像，如果今年的农产品丰收了，广大农民就要拿比过去多的农产品来交换工业品，如果工业方面不开展先进生产者运动，不动员职工想尽一切办法，包括节约的办法来增加生产，试问，用什么去跟农民交换呢？
    的确，由于原材料的供应不充分，今年有些工厂和建筑安装企业会发生生产任务不足的问题。但是我们应该看到，从全国来说，毕竟绝大部分的工矿企业和建筑安装企业的生产任务仍然是很繁重的。正因为原材料有困难，那些生产原材料的工业部门更应该坚持开展先进生产者运动，增产更多的工业原材料来供应使用部门。那些使用原材料的工业部门，特别是因为原材料缺乏而生产任务不足的企业，更应该开展先进生产者运动，努力提高产品质量，在保证产品质量的条件下节约原材料来增加生产。有些生产任务不足的企业，还可以在开展先进生产者运动中发动群众从寻找代用品、试制和生产新产品、进行机器设备检修、揽临时活等等办法中减少停工待料的损失。而所有的工业企业，要达到提高技术、提高产品质量、提高劳动生产率、降低成本的目的，那么，坚持开展先进生产者运动正是一个行之有效的好方法。
    由于去年在工资和福利费方面增长得比较多，加以今年在财政上和物资供应上存在着一定的困难，所以今年国家一般地将不增加工资和福利费的开支。但是，大家知道，我国职工的工资和福利费用，都是在生产发展的基础上逐步提高的，现在开展先进生产者运动，千方百计地增产节约，正是为今后增加工资和福利费用打下坚实的物质基础。所以，先进生产者运动是十分有必要坚持开展下去的。
    把先进生产者运动坚持开展下去，以达到增产节约的目的，这不仅是必要的，而且也是可能的。例如大连造船公司经过调查研究，发现企业内部利用同样设备做同样工作的单位，都普遍存在着先进同落后的区别。他们新建成的五条一千二百马力拖船，每条船的材料消耗量就相差很多。其中十三号船和十四号船，仅钢板一项就超过了材料消耗定额三十一吨半，而十五号船却比定额降低一吨。他们发动落后的赶上先进的，就可以节约不少材料来增加生产。事实上，许多企业中的先进生产者运动今年以来仍然在坚持开展着，而且取得了很大的成绩。例如，鞍钢大孤山铁矿的矿工们，冒着严寒在露天或坑洞里生产，他们坚持开展先进生产者运动的结果，今年1月份超额二万零六十吨完成了矿石生产计划，全月产量比去年同期增加了二十二万九千吨。又如过去两年都没有完成生产计划的陕西省渭南油电厂，在去年12月开展了先进生产者运动，认真推广了“蒸透炒好”、“调换榨螺”等先进经验，结果，超额1.47％完成了1月份计划，棉籽出油率由14.75％提高到15.6％，精炼率提高到92％，还保证了安全运转。由此可见，那种认为今年没有必要或无法坚持开展先进生产者运动，以及认为增产节约没有多大油水的说法，都是不对的。
    为了千方百计地增产节约，超额完成今年的国家计划，我们必须吸取去年的经验，把先进生产者运动坚持开展下去。在去年的先进生产者运动中，互相帮助、互相学习的风气已经形成，并且有许多企业广泛签订了厂与厂之间、工人与职员之间、工人与工人之间的互助合同，真正达到了有什么教什么、缺什么学什么的程度。这样，便进一步加强了职工的团结，使大批普通生产者达到了先进生产者的水平，并促使先进生产者更加先进。这是需要继续发扬的。但是，在去年，有些单位对先进的和落后的关心较多，对于广大的普通生产者关心不够，所以产生的先进集体还不太多。因此，今后在关心先进者和落后者的同时，还需要关心广大的普通生产者，使他们赶上先进，共同提高，争取出现更多的先进班组、先进车间和先进企业，使整个儿的生产水平更提高一步。先进生产者的人数是经常变化的，没有必要机械地要求一律达到百分之几十。
    总结和推广先进经验、开展合理化建议，是在先进生产者运动中克服形式主义的中心环节，也是增产节约的中心环节。去年各产业在评选先进生产者和召开先进生产者代表会议中，曾把各企业已有的先进经验集中起来，向全国推广，收到了良好的效果。但是，在推广先进经验过程中，有些单位不经过鉴定，不顾本单位设备条件和技术水平，便盲目推广，因而效果不大，甚至造成了浪费。有的单位在推广先进经验的时候，只注意要提高劳动生产率，没有注意减轻工人的劳动强度，因而不能持久。因此，今后需要弄清，某种先进经验要不要推广，就看它能不能解决本企业生产中的关键问题，绝不能脱离本企业的实际条件而盲目推广。同时，要推广的先进经验必须有利于改善工人劳动条件和减轻工人劳动强度。用损害工人身体健康和其他不安全的办法来增产节约，是不能允许的。去年的合理化建议工作虽有了很大的开展，但有不少单位仍然没有针对生产中的薄弱环节提出课题，今后需要继续挖掘群众中的技术财富，把群众的智慧集中到企业中关键性的问题上来。无论在推广先进经验和开展合理化建议中，都希望企业行政在试验材料上给以大力支持。也希望企业的上级经济领导机关在这方面给企业以一定的便利。
    加强领导是把先进生产者运动坚持开展下去的决定因素。去年，先进生产者运动能够逐步深入，并且取得很大成绩，主要是由于有各级党委直接领导，而且各企业行政也能和工会一道，积极地参加这一工作的领导的结果。但是，有些地区和单位只满足于表面的轰轰烈烈，机械地要求先进生产者的数字，有些单位只满足于厂际之间的来往，对于班组竞赛的工作则放松了领导。今后，希望企业领导方面能够深入进行细致的思想政治工作和组织工作，特别需要发动科室人员深入车间，帮助职工克服增产节约当中的各种困难，切实保证生产计划的圆满实现。为了达到这个目的，科室竞赛也需要广泛发动起来。
    目前，许多厂矿企业正在研究怎样增产节约，可是有些单位的领导同志仍然只在办公室里打算盘，打来打去总觉得困难重重，却根本没有把计划和群众见面。这种作法是不好的。希望企业领导方面迅速把计划交给群众讨论，并且发动群众开展先进生产者运动，想尽一切办法增产节约。
