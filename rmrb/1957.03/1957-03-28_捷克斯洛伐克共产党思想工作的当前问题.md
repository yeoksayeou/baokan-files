Current Problems of Ideological Work of the Czechoslovak Communist Party
Václav Slavík, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party

Our country is advancing smoothly along the road of socialist construction. The people's democratic system, based on the unbreakable alliance of workers and peasants, has been further consolidated and developed recently. The strength and international prestige of the Czechoslovak Republic have grown. Industrial production, in which socialist production relations have gained complete dominance, has been continuously improving in each year since the completion of the First Five-Year Plan in 1953, and the rate of improvement has been even faster than during the First Five-Year Plan period. Since the Tenth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party (June 1954), agricultural production has also made increasingly significant progress, and the proportion of socialist large-scale commodity production in agricultural production has been continuously increasing. In recent years, the policy of our Party and government to continuously improve the material and cultural living standards of the working people has been successfully implemented, and the living standards of our working people have reached an unprecedented height.

The Party's National Conference (June 1956), held under the tremendous ideological influence of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, put forward the task of building the material production base of socialism in our country during the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) on the basis of the achievements already made. Our Republic (which was already a highly developed industrial country when it embarked on the socialist road) has caught up with the major economically developed capitalist countries due to the smooth progress of socialist construction. Now our task is to catch up with and surpass the most advanced capitalist countries in terms of per capita output in the shortest historical period.

Of course, the magnificent prospect of a socialist future unfolding before the working people of our country is absolutely not liked by the imperialist enemies of our Republic and their accomplices; their various representatives from Western capitalist countries have launched activities against our country. Precisely because of this, our country has recently become a focal point of fierce attacks by bourgeois propaganda. At the same time, the imperialist spy agencies have intensified their sabotage work in our country and their conspiracies to encourage the activities of class enemies.

All these actions against us are an integral part of the imperialists' large-scale offensive against the cause of socialism; they intend to use this offensive to offset the tremendous achievements of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, which are of great significance to all socialist countries and the revolutionary and progressive movements of the world. The imperialists, alarmed by the rapid growth of socialist, progressive, and peace forces in various countries, intend to prevent the further positive development of the world situation and are willing to take any means to achieve this. The main goal of the imperialists is to undermine socialist ideology and the ideology of national liberation movements, and to prevent their further spread in the world. Because the Soviet Union, People's China, and other socialist countries are the main embodiments of socialist ideology, and because the world socialist system is a powerful pillar of the entire international proletariat and the entire movement for peace and national liberation, the imperialists first direct their spearhead at the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp. In these attempts, the imperialists regard our country, which is located on the western outpost of the socialist camp, as a quite important target.

If it is said that this concentrated firepower attack by the imperialists against the socialist camp has now been largely repelled, and the socialist forces are continuing to advance irresistibly, then the situation is exactly the same for our country. In some recent events, the people of our country demonstrated their unwavering loyalty to socialist ideology and the idea of international solidarity of the working people, and in practice proved their firm determination to strive to promote the consolidation of the socialist camp and to fearlessly struggle against various conspiracies of the enemies of socialism and peace. The position taken by the Czechoslovak people on the October events in our neighboring country of Hungary is the best evidence of this. The working people of our country fully understand that internal and external reactionary forces have invested all their strength there in an attempt to eliminate the achievements of the revolution in this country and turn Hungary into a new source of war in Europe. In the Hungarian people's struggle against counter-revolution, the people of our country unreservedly stood by the Hungarian people and warmly welcomed the news of the crushing of the counter-revolution. The people of our country regard the Soviet army's assistance to Hungary at the invitation of the Hungarian government as a true expression of internationalism serving the cause of peace and socialism.

Recently, national front activist conferences and mass rallies of working people were held throughout our country to discuss the results of the negotiations between the delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic and the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the Soviet government and the Soviet Communist Party in Moscow in January this year. The results of this negotiation further strengthened friendship with the Soviet Union and cooperation with the Soviet Union in political, economic, and cultural fields. It is an outstanding contribution to the cause of further uniting socialist countries and strengthening progressive forces throughout the world, and it has been unanimously supported by all the people of Czechoslovakia.

The ever-increasing achievements of our people in construction and their firm and unwavering stance on recent events prove the ever-increasing socialist consciousness of the Czechoslovak working people and prove the correct leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party over them. This is undoubtedly the result of the propaganda and education work carried out by our Party, which has consistently taken the great Marxist-Leninist theory as its guide.

The great new tasks of socialist construction require us to first strengthen the Party's ideological education work and more closely link this work with the practice of socialist construction. It would be a mistake not to see this. At the same time, we must maintain the highest vigilance against the attempts of the imperialists to conduct hostile activities against our country. We must remember that after the failure of their conspiracies, the imperialists, out of hatred for our Republic, will more stubbornly try to find ways to sabotage us.

The most important issue in our country's socialist construction at present is to improve the efficiency of work in all sectors of the national economy. To maximize the efficiency of social product production, national income creation and distribution. The guarantee of our country's further rapid economic growth and the policy of continuously improving the living standards of workers depend on the solution of this issue. The measures we have taken in accordance with the decisions of the Party's National Conference, namely greatly expanding the power of enterprises and rural leaders to manage the economy and administer the country while strengthening centralized management of key issues, have created the most favorable preconditions for achieving this task. However, in order to implement the important task of improving the efficiency of work in all sectors of the national economy (involving all sectors of the country's economic and social life), it is necessary to concentrate all efforts on the Party's explanation and education work among the masses, so as to effectively implement the necessary measures for the organization, management, and planning of the national economy, and to carry out the struggle against all spontaneous phenomena.

Bourgeois hostile propaganda also attempts here to confuse workers with the slogan of "national communism," striving to revive the so-called "democracy" and "freedom" of the liberals, to undermine the international solidarity of the working people, and to try to exaggerate our deviations and shortcomings into the main divergences in the world, thereby concealing the principled divergences that divide the capitalist world. We cannot remain indifferent to those various revisionist attempts that intentionally or unintentionally violate the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism in some places. For this reason, it is necessary to ideologically consolidate our Party's ranks, actively carry out the Party's propaganda work, and wage an irreconcilable struggle against all manifestations and influences of bourgeois ideology according to our theory. We believe that this struggle will further strengthen the Party's unity and deepen the Party's solid ties with the people.

The Czechoslovak Communist Party consistently adheres to the principle in its activities that the active participation of Party members in the struggle to eliminate capitalism and build a socialist society is the most effective way to educate Party members and other workers. Precisely for this reason, the current activities of the Czechoslovak Communist Party is to make Party members stand at the forefront of the struggle to build socialism, and to attract the broadest masses of workers to actively engage in the work of building a new society. For this reason, attention should also be focused on closely integrating the Party's daily explanation work to the masses with life.

All the resolutions made by the Party's leading organs recently emphasized the great significance of Marxist economic theory at the present stage, and emphasized the necessity of attaching importance to international political issues in propaganda work. In addition, these resolutions also talked about the need to improve the level of propaganda and education work, and the need to give all activities of our Party a higher ideological level.

It can be said that this propaganda and education work policy and the work of eliminating various shortcomings caused by dogmatism and lack of principle have already taken effect, and it has effectively improved the interest of our 1.5 million Party members and all levels of workers in ideological issues.

The fact that more than 30,000 of the nearly 55,000 groups in the Party education system are studying economic issues and political economy shows that the interest in Marxist-Leninist economic theory is growing in the Party's ranks. Most of the non-Party members participating in the Party education system are also studying economic issues and political economy. In addition, trade unions and other organizations are also increasingly broadly instilling knowledge about economic issues to workers.

The number of reports and various lectures on international relations and major issues in the modern international political situation is increasing. Our newspapers and periodicals are also carrying out work in this direction. Recently, many new magazines have been added in our country, which shows that people's interest in our newspapers and periodicals is growing. But this is still not enough to meet the growing demands of the working people of our country. The people of our country are very concerned about foreign policy issues and the achievements of the Soviet Union, People's China, and other socialist countries in construction, and are concerned about all major events that occur in the world, and hope to know the modern international situation and its prospects.

Although the line that our Party has implemented so far is correct, and the working people headed by the working class actively support the Party's policies, we cannot fail to see the series of problems that we face with the new tasks of construction, and we cannot relax our attention to the existing errors and shortcomings in our work. This is more closely related to ideological work.

The 20th Congress of the CPSU and its resolutions are a very valuable factor in promoting our country's ideological work. This historically significant meeting enriched the international revolutionary movement with new arguments about the development of modern society, made principled assessments of the major ideological and political issues in the development of the modern international situation, and contributed the infinitely valuable experience of the CPSU to the cause of building a communist society. The 20th Congress of the CPSU critically criticized the cult of personality and its consequences, and exposed the influence of hostile ideology, which all communist parties should resolutely struggle against.

Our Party has earnestly studied the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, and drawn conclusions from these resolutions based on our country's actual situation and conditions. The Party did not treat the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU one-sidedly, and did not only and primarily pay attention to the issue of the cult of personality, but regarded these resolutions as a whole, and saw the broad prospects revealed by the 20th Congress of the CPSU on the basis of fully utilizing the experience of the international communist movement. The Party's starting point in discussing the issue of the cult of personality is that this is only a stage that the Soviet Union has gone through, and although the cult of personality has brought losses to socialist construction, the cult of personality cannot change and has not changed the foundation of the Soviet system, nor has it hindered the further advancement of the Soviet Union. Our Party criticized the cult of personality of Stalin, because this cult of personality had harmful effects both in the Soviet Union and in the international movement, but our Party did not underestimate Stalin's great achievements as a thorough Marxist-Leninist.

The following point cannot be avoided: some unrealistic remarks have also appeared in our country, which attempt to regard the internal differences of opinion in our country's socialist construction process as more important than the irreconcilable contradiction between the main socialism and capitalism, these remarks attempt to doubt whether the achievements of the Soviet historical experience can be applied under the conditions of our country, and obviously violate the facts, only attempting to see the dark side of our actual life. Those who published these remarks are those who grew up under the influence of bourgeois ideology and are still affected by bourgeois ideology. In these remarks, the reactions of some incorrect tendencies in other countries can undoubtedly also be heard. However, these remarks, which mostly came from a part of the Czechoslovak intelligentsia, were not widely disseminated, and were severely criticized by the entire Party. The Communist Party did not conceal the above-mentioned incorrect views from the broad masses of working people, and already spoke out to refute these views at the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party held last March. As a result, these unhealthy views were rejected by the entire people of our country.

Our Party is determined to wage a resolute struggle against the various revisionist views and attempts to revive revisionism that have recently appeared. Bourgeois apologists believe that revisionist views are the main weapon in the struggle against communist ideology today. These revisionist and opportunist views first deny the Marxist-Leninist principles that are universally applicable and necessary for all countries that build socialism. Arming all Party members to fight against these incorrect views and tendencies is the most important task on our entire ideological front at present. Our responsibility is to study and widely carry out propaganda and explanation work, and fully explain the views and relevant experiences of our Party on the following issues, which are included in the statement of the talks between the delegation of the Soviet Communist Party and the delegation of the Czechoslovak Communist Party published on January 31 this year.

This statement mentioned: "Lenin's theory about the role of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the struggle to build socialism; about the leadership of the masses by the Marxist party of the working class, and the ideological unity of this party and the continuous consolidation of its ties with the masses are of paramount importance to the success of this struggle; about the necessity of consolidating and expanding the socialist ownership and socialist public ownership of the socialist countries and developing the planned economy; about the necessity of continuously deepening and improving socialist democracy by absorbing the broad masses into participating in the management of national and economic life through forms that adapt to the traditions and conditions of each country; about the necessity of resolutely defending the achievements of the socialist revolution from the past ruling classes, the exploitation classes' infringement, and the imperialist reactionaries' invasion and other principles' correctness has been completely confirmed by the experience and practice of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and all other socialist countries."

Based on these principles, we believe that it is very important at present to study the problems of our country's socialist economic development. In this regard, we are concerned with creatively applying the principles of socialist economy under our country's current conditions, and resolutely opposing revising these principles. Although revisionist and opportunist views have recently appeared in some countries' discussions of socialist economic construction, generally speaking, they have not found suitable soil in our country. We do not want to take an indifferent attitude towards them, we should even thoroughly eradicate their insignificant traces. If in the political aspect, we have to struggle against revisionism that denies the dictatorship of the proletariat, denies the leading role of the Party, and denies the principles of proletarian internationalism, then in the economic aspect, the problems are first about denying the organizational and economic role of socialist countries, about the tendency to eliminate the state form of public ownership, about various incorrect opinions about the application of economic laws, about incorrectly opposing centralization and democracy, collective interests and individual interests, and so on. It can be said that something similar to the basis of these revisionist views is the theory about the spontaneity of socialist construction, that is, the belief that socialist construction does not need any purposeful leadership and organization work. Our Party believes that such incorrect views are a failure to understand the socialist economic system and its regularity, and a retreat in the face of the difficulties of building socialism. The recent Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee held in February this year directed our ideological work to the struggle against these incorrect views, and put forward a great program for improving the efficiency of the national economy before us. Therefore, large-scale ideological work is now being carried out, with the aim of enabling Party members and the broad masses of workers to more fully grasp and apply Marxist economic theory in practice.

Recently, there is an important task in our ideological work, that is, to eradicate dogmatism in explaining various issues related to our lives, because this important task still exists and has not been thoroughly resolved. At the same time, there is also an argument that the struggle against dogmatism is to abandon the principles of Marxism-Leninism. This is completely inconsistent with reality.

Our Party requires thorough eradication of dogmatism, while emphasizing that there must be a high degree of principle, emphasizing that in any case, special attention should always be paid to the purity of Marxist-Leninist theory. The Party always resolutely makes the workers in the ideological sector pay attention to the most urgent issues of the present, and the Party calls on them to understand the actual situation of our society as much as possible, and provides them with rich materials in this regard, which is of great significance in the struggle against dogmatism. The phenomenon that ideological workers thoroughly understand the Party's most important resolutions and current issues, while relying on various committees belonging to the Party organization to solve these problems, has become more and more common in the practice of the central and local levels. However, there are also some Party members who cannot analyze the actual situation, and are affected by the spontaneity of the petty bourgeoisie, abandoning the class position and class viewpoint. Therefore, while constantly carrying out the struggle against dogmatism, we must also pay attention to a high degree of principle, treat various issues with a class viewpoint, and consistently apply the correct Marxist-Leninist principles.

Vigorously strengthening our activities in rural areas is an important task in unfolding propaganda and explanation work. The reason for putting forward this task is not only because we want socialist production relations to occupy a decisive advantage in our country's rural areas during the Second Five-Year Plan, but also because we have not achieved full development in this area so far, especially in some work. The current issue is to first deepen and expand economic knowledge. The economic meetings held in various places recently are an effective way to solve this problem. Those who participated in these meetings were members of unified agricultural cooperatives and some farmers who are still engaged in individual operations. These meetings mainly discussed a certain issue that needs to be solved most urgently in the local area, such as the issue of production expenses, the issue of improving labor productivity, etc. The actual situation of our propaganda and mobilization work in rural areas tells us that we have not given due attention to the explanation work of international issues and our foreign policy so far. At the same time, experience shows that every major international event has a great impact on rural residents. Although a large part of our newspapers and periodicals are supplied to rural areas, almost every household in rural areas has a radio, and the rural television network has been expanding, this is still not enough. Propagandists must carry out large-scale and lively oral propaganda in rural areas, and we must try our best to do this.

Recently, the characteristic of our Party's work is that we have begun to pay more attention to propaganda and education work among intellectuals. The starting point of all the Party's activities is this, we must unite the old intellectuals around us, and use their talents to build a new society, while cultivating many new intellectuals from workers and peasants. Transforming the old intellectuals and educating the new intellectuals is a complex problem. If we can make them have a scientific and materialistic world outlook, if we can better explain modern social events and natural phenomena according to our theory, and conduct principled debates to oppose incorrect views and wrong positions, then this problem will be solved more smoothly.

If we only limit ourselves to criticizing the bad phenomena among some intellectuals, this is far from enough; we need to first carry out active work among them, and struggle against some incorrect views about democracy, freedom, etc., these views have nothing in common with true democracy and freedom.

In the past few years, the Party has carried out a huge work to oppose the bad phenomenon of worshipping bourgeois culture, and has strengthened the education work of socialist patriotism. Since then, our scientific world outlook has been continuously expanding and strengthening among the broad intellectuals. Now, it is necessary to carry out huge work in the ranks of intellectuals, mobilize them to correctly use our principles to oppose various nihilistic tendencies.

Recently, whenever the Party and the government pass various important resolutions, large-scale activist meetings are organized in universities, scientific institutions, and cultural institutions, and at the meetings, respected activists of our Party explain the significance of the resolutions that have been passed. This method has now been promoted and is effective. At the same time, representatives of intellectuals are increasingly widely absorbed to prepare materials for the Party and government organs, and the solutions to important issues in our socialist life are the result of studying these materials.

The development of theoretical work is an important condition for the development of propaganda and education activities in our country. Now, our theorists are also facing some major tasks. The current task is mainly to summarize the rich experience accumulated by our Party in the cause of socialist construction, and to point out the contributions that our country, which is highly industrialized and has embarked on the socialist road, has brought to Marxist-Leninist science. Today, twelve years after the establishment of the People's Democratic Republic, this task is an exceptionally important task, it is not only significant for further developing Marxist-Leninist theory, but also primarily significant for our country's future practical activities. At the same time, the problem also involves overcoming the harmful consequences of the cult of personality and the theories that have spread under the influence of the cult of personality, such as the problem of class struggle.

Now, we can point out the progress of scientific research work, first in economics and history. Economists are now paying attention to studying the basic laws of the socialist economy and the methods of applying them. In the field of historical science, it is necessary to point out the first part of the history of the Czechoslovak people that has been written, this part is written from the viewpoint of Marxist-Leninist theory, and it is also necessary to point out the textbook outline about the history of our Party. This outline has been handed over to scientific cadres and propaganda cadres for public discussion. The situation in philosophy is serious. In this aspect, we very much need new works that can analyze today's social phenomena and the changes in our society, that can use the viewpoint of dialectical materialism to explain the social significance of new scientific discoveries, and thereby promote the deepening and further expansion of our materialistic scientific world outlook.

The Party's attention to education work is also constantly strengthening. This is the result of the improvement of the consciousness of the working people of our country. Now they are more actively participating in the construction of socialism, and they recognize their great responsibility for socialism and the cause of peace in the world. Our Party has the responsibility to lead this work and to give this work a clear content. But this does not mean that all work can be achieved by relying on the strength of the Party. The Czechoslovak Communist Party has now paid special attention to this point, that is, to make all mass and social organizations, first of all trade unions and youth organizations, put the main force on education work and explaining the significance and purpose of our construction to the working masses.

In order for our Party's extensive education and explanation work to be successful, we must learn from the experience of the fraternal communist parties, first of all the experience of the Soviet Communist Party. Our basis is: the Soviet Union, as the leading force of the world socialist system and as the center of the international workers' revolutionary movement, has accumulated extremely rich experience in the struggle for a new society, and has also accumulated extremely rich experience in the cause of creatively developing and disseminating Marxist-Leninist ideas and educating new socialist people. We should first of all thank the rich experience of the great Soviet Communist Party for the many achievements we have made in the past and present.

The experience of the Chinese Communist Party has aroused great attention and interest in us. The Chinese Communist Party has enriched the theory of Marxism-Leninism, greatly promoted its development, and made valuable examples of creatively solving the problems of socialist construction. The huge education work carried out by the glorious Chinese Communist Party is widely known in our country. This education work has tempered the Chinese people in the heroic struggle for the victory of people's power, and has effectively promoted their greater achievements in the great cause of Chinese construction.

A series of examples can be cited to illustrate how we are paying attention to studying the experience of the Chinese Communist Party, especially the experience in propaganda and education work and its methods. Recently, the two articles in "People's Daily" on the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat aroused great interest and approval. These two articles are being widely studied, and many places have also organized special discussion meetings. The documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party are also the focus of attention. The Czechoslovak communists have seen in these documents the model of the principledness of Marxism-Leninism and the creative development of this great theory. The selected works of Comrade Mao Zedong published in Czech and Slovak have greatly helped the development of our ideological work.

This year, the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, our Party will extensively unfold propaganda and explanation work, so as to further achieve the cause of our people building a new society, and to strengthen the international ties between the working people of our country and the people of the Soviet Union, the great China, and other countries of the socialist camp and the workers of the whole world. The great ideas of Marxism-Leninism won victory in the Soviet Union forty years ago, and now, it has won victory in the vast areas between the Elbe River and the Pacific Ocean, and illuminates the road for the people of Czechoslovakia and all the people of the socialist camp to advance towards socialism and communism.

   捷克斯洛伐克共产党思想工作的当前问题
   捷共中央宣传部长　瓦茨拉夫·斯拉维克
    我国正在沿着社会主义建设的道路顺利前进。以牢不可破的工农联盟为基础的人民民主制度，近来得到了进一步的巩固和发展。捷克斯洛伐克共和国的力量和国际威望增长了。社会主义生产关系已占完全优势的工业生产，在1953年完成第一个五年计划以来的各个年度中不断提高，提高的速度比执行第一个五年计划时期更加迅速了。自从捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会（1954年6月）以来，农业生产也有了日益显著的进展，社会主义的大规模的商品生产在农业生产中所占的比重不断增加。近几年来，我们的党和政府不断提高劳动人民物质和文化水平的政策在顺利地实施着，我国劳动人民的生活水平目前已达到前所未有的高度。
    在苏共第二十次代表大会的巨大思想影响下举行的党的全国代表会议（1956年6月），在已经取得的成就的基础上，提出了在第二个五年计划期间（1956—1960年）在我国建成社会主义物质生产基础的任务。我们的共和国（它在走上社会主义道路时已经是个工业高度发达的国家）由于社会主义建设的顺利进展，已经赶上了经济发达的主要资本主义国家。现在我们的任务是要在最短的历史时期内，在按人口计算的产量方面赶上并超过最先进的资本主义国家。
    当然，在我国劳动人民面前展开的社会主义未来的宏伟前景，绝对不是我们共和国的帝国主义敌人及其走卒所喜欢的；来自西方各资本主义国家的他们的形形色色的代表人物，展开了反对我国的活动。也正是因为这样，近来我国成为资产阶级宣传猛烈攻击的一个焦点。同时，帝国主义间谍机关在我国进行破坏工作和助长阶级敌人活动的阴谋，也变本加厉了。
    这一切与我们为敌的行动，是帝国主义者对社会主义事业大举进攻的一个组成部分；他们打算用这种进攻抵消苏共第二十次代表大会对所有社会主义国家以及全世界革命和进步运动具有重要意义的巨大成果。因世界各国社会主义、进步和和平力量的迅速增长而惊慌的帝国主义者，打算阻止世界局势进一步的良好发展，并为此不惜采取任何手段。帝国主义者的主要目的，是要破坏社会主义思想和民族解放运动思想，不让它们在世界上进一步传播。因为苏联、人民中国和其他社会主义国家是社会主义思想的主要体现者，因为世界社会主义体系是整个国际无产阶级、整个争取和平和民族解放运动的有力支柱，所以帝国主义者首先把他们的矛头指向苏联和整个社会主义阵营。帝国主义者在他们的这些图谋中，把处在社会主义阵营西部前哨的我国当作一个相当重要的对象。
    如果说帝国主义者对社会主义阵营的这种集中火力的进攻现在基本上已被击退，而且社会主义力量在不可遏止地继续前进，那末，对于我国说来，情形也完全是这样。在不久以前发生的一些事件中，我国人民表现了对社会主义思想、国际劳动人民团结思想的不可动摇的忠诚，并在实际上证明了自己努力促进社会主义阵营巩固和对社会主义及和平的敌人的各种阴谋诡计进行无畏斗争的坚强决心。捷克斯洛伐克人民对于在我们的邻邦匈牙利所发生的10月事件所持的立场，是这方面的最好的证据。我国劳动人民十分了解，在那里，内外反动势力投入全部力量企图在这个国家消灭革命的成果并把匈牙利变成欧洲的新战争策源地。在匈牙利人民对反革命的斗争中，我国人民毫无保留地站在匈牙利人民一边，并异常热烈地欢迎反革命被粉碎的消息。我国人民把苏联军队应匈牙利政府的邀请驰援匈牙利的行动，看作是为和平和社会主义事业服务的国际主义的真正表现。
    最近在我们全国举行了民族阵线积极分子会议和劳动人民的群众大会，讨论捷克斯洛伐克共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共产党代表团今年1月在莫斯科同苏联政府和苏联共产党代表谈判的结果。这次谈判结果进一步加强了同苏联的友谊和同苏联在政治、经济和文化方面的合作，它是对进一步团结社会主义国家和加强全世界进步力量的事业的卓越贡献，它受到了捷克斯洛伐克全体人民的一致拥护。
    我国人民在建设中的日益增长的成就和对近来一些事件的坚定不移的立场，证明了捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民日益提高的社会主义觉悟，证明了捷克斯洛伐克共产党对他们的正确领导。这无疑地是一贯以伟大的马克思列宁主义学说为指南的我们的党所进行的宣传教育工作的结果。
    社会主义建设的巨大新任务要求我们首先要更加加强党的思想教育工作，并把这一工作同社会主义建设的实践更紧密地联系起来。不看到这一点就会犯错误。同时，我们必须对帝国主义者对我国进行敌对活动的企图保持最高的警戒。要记住，帝国主义者在他们的阴谋失败以后，由于对我们共和国的仇恨，将更加顽固地想方设法对我们进行破坏。
    目前我国社会主义建设的最重要问题是提高国民经济各个部门的工作效率。要使社会产品的生产、国民收入的创造和分配达到最高限度的效益。我国经济的进一步急剧增长和不断提高劳动者生活水平的政策的保证，都有赖于目前这个问题的解决。我们根据党的全国代表会议决议所采取的措施，即在加强对首要问题的集中管理的同时，大大扩大企业和农村领导经济和管理国家的权力，为实现这一任务创造了最有利的前提。但是，为了贯彻提高国民经济各部门的工作效率（涉及国家的经济和社会生活一切部门）这一重要任务，就必须把全部力量集中在党对群众的解释和教育工作上，以便能够有效地贯彻实施有关国民经济的组织、管理和计划工作的必要措施，并开展同一切自发现象的斗争。
    资产阶级的敌意宣传在我们这里也企图用“民族共产主义”的口号迷惑劳动者，力图复活自由主义者所谓的“民主”和“自由”，破坏劳动人民的国际团结，并试图把我们的偏差和缺点夸大成为世界的主要分歧，从而掩盖那分裂资本主义世界的原则性分歧。对那些有意或无意地在某些地方违背马克思列宁主义基本原则的各种修正主义的尝试，我们不能漠然视之。为此就必须从思想上巩固我们党的队伍，积极开展党的宣传工作，根据我们的学说同资产阶级思想的一切表现和影响进行不调和的斗争。我们认为，这种斗争将进一步加强党的团结和加深党同人民的巩固联系。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党在自己的活动中一贯地坚持这样的原则：党员积极地参加消灭资本主义和建设社会主义社会的斗争，是教育党员和其他劳动者的最有效的方法。正因为这样，捷克斯洛伐克共产党目前进行的活动，就是使党员走在为建成社会主义而斗争的前列，吸引最广泛的劳动群众积极从事建设新社会的工作。为此，还应当集中注意于把党对群众的日常解释工作同生活密切结合起来。
    党的领导机关最近以来作出的一切决议，都着重指出了马克思主义经济学说在现阶段的巨大意义，指出了在宣传工作中重视国际政治问题的必要性。此外，在这些决议中还谈到必须提高宣传教育工作的水平，必须使我们党的全部活动具有更高的思想水平。
    可以说，这种宣传教育工作方针和消除由于教条主义和缺乏原则性而产生的各种缺点的工作都已经收到效果，它有效地提高了我们的一百五十万党员以及各阶层劳动人民对思想问题的兴趣。
    在党教育系统总共将近五万五千个小组中，已有三万多个小组在研究经济问题和政治经济学；这一事实说明，党的队伍中对马克思列宁主义经济学说的兴趣在日益增长。参加党教育系统学习的非党人士，大多数也在研究经济问题和政治经济学。此外，工会及其他组织也在日益广泛地向劳动者灌输关于经济问题的知识。
    关于国际关系和现代国际政治局势中主要问题的报告和各种讲座的次数日益增多了。我国报刊也朝着这个方向开展工作。最近，我国又增加了很多新的杂志，这说明人们对我们报刊的兴趣愈来愈大了。但是这还不能满足我国劳动人民日益增长的要求。我国人民十分关心对外政策问题和苏联、人民中国以及其他社会主义国家建设的成就，关心世界上发生的一切重大事情，并且希望知道现代国际局势及其远景。
    虽然我们党直到目前为止所执行的路线是正确的，以工人阶级为首的劳动人民对党的政策是积极支持的，但是我们不能看不见随着建设的新任务而面临的一系列问题，我们不能放松对我们工作中现存的错误和缺点的注意。这与思想工作有更大的关系。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会及其决议是推动我国思想工作的十分宝贵的因素。这次具有历史意义的会议用关于现代社会发展的新论点丰富了国际革命运动，对现代国际局势发展中的主要思想问题和政治问题作了原则性的估价，把苏共无限宝贵的经验贡献给建设共产主义社会的事业。苏共第二十次代表大会批判地指责了个人崇拜及其后果，揭露了敌对思想的影响，而对于这种敌对思想，是各国共产党都应当与之进行坚决斗争的。
    我们的党认真地研究了苏共第二十次代表大会的决议，并且根据我国的实际情况和条件从这些决议中作出了结论。党没有片面地对待苏共第二十次代表大会的决议，没有仅仅和首先注意个人崇拜问题，而是把这些决议看成一个整体，看到了苏共第二十次代表大会在全面利用国际共产主义运动经验的基础上所揭示出的广阔远景。我们党在讨论个人崇拜问题时所持的出发点是，这仅仅是苏联所经过的一个阶段，尽管个人崇拜给社会主义建设带来了损失，可是个人崇拜一点也不能改变、并且也没有改变苏维埃制度的基础，也没有阻碍了苏联进一步的前进。我们党指责了对斯大林的个人崇拜，因为这种个人崇拜无论在苏联国内或在国际运动中都起了有害的影响，但是我们党并没有轻视作为彻底的马克思列宁主义者的斯大林的巨大功绩。
    下面这一点也不能避而不谈：在我国也曾出现一些不切实际的言论，这些言论企图把我国在社会主义建设过程中的内部分歧意见看成比主要的社会主义同资本主义之间不可调和的矛盾还要重要，这些言论企图怀疑在我国的条件下是否能应用苏联历史经验的成果，并明显地违反事实，只企图看到我们实际生活中的阴暗的一面。发表这些论调的就是那些在资产阶级思想影响下生长起来并且直到现在还受着资产阶级思想影响的人。在这些论调里，无疑也可以听到其他国家里一些不正确的倾向的反应。然而，这些多半出自一部分捷克斯洛伐克知识界的言论，传播得并不广泛，而且受到全党的严厉斥责。共产党丝毫没有向广大的劳动人民群众来隐瞒上述不正确的观点，并且在去年3月举行的捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央全会上已经发言批驳了这些观点。结果，这些不健康的意见遭到我国全体人民的摒弃。
    我们党坚决与最近出现的各种修正主义观点和复活修正主义的企图作坚决的斗争。资产阶级辩护者认为修正主义观点是今天反对共产主义思想斗争的主要武器。这些修正主义和机会主义的观点首先是否认放之四海而皆准的一切建设社会主义的国家所必需的马克思列宁主义原则。武装起全体党员去与这些不正确的观点和倾向作斗争，是目前我们整个思想战线上一项最重要的任务。我们的责任是，研究和广泛地开展宣传解释工作，充分解释我们党在下列这些问题上的观点和有关经验，这些问题包括在今年1月31日发表的苏联共产党代表团和捷克斯洛伐克共产党代表团会谈声明中。
    在这个声明中谈到：“列宁关于无产阶级专政在建成社会主义的斗争中的作用；关于工人阶级马克思主义政党对群众的领导、这个政党的思想统一和同群众联系的不断巩固对这个斗争的成功具有头等意义；关于必须巩固并扩大社会主义国家所有制和社会主义公有制以及发展计划经济；关于必须通过适应每个国家的传统和条件的形式吸收广大群众参与管理国家生活和经济生活，借以不断加深和改进社会主义民主；关于必须坚决保卫社会主义革命的成果不受过去的统治阶级、剥削阶级侵害、不受帝国主义反动派的侵犯等原理的正确性，完全被苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和其他所有社会主义国家社会主义建设的经验和实践所证实了。”
    根据这些原理，我们认为研究我国社会主义经济发展问题在目前来说是十分重要的。在这方面，我们关心在我国现在条件下创造性地运用社会主义经济原则，并坚决反对修正这些原则。虽然修正主义和机会主义的观点最近在某些国家讨论社会主义经济建设的过程中出现了，但是总的说来它们在我国没有找到适合的土壤。我们对它们不想采取漠然置之的态度，我们应当甚至把它们的微不足道的痕迹也彻底根除。如果在政治方面不得不与否认无产阶级专政、否认党的领导作用和无产阶级国际主义原则的修正主义作斗争的话，那么在经济方面的问题首先是关于否认社会主义国家在组织上和经济上的作用，关于消灭公有制的国家形式的倾向，关于各式各样有关运用经济规律的不正确意见，关于把集中与民主、集体利益和个人利益不正确地对立起来等等。可以说，某种类似这些修正主义观点的基础的东西，是关于社会主义建设自发性的理论，即认为社会主义建设不需要有任何有目的的领导和组织工作。我们党认为诸如此类的不正确的观点，就是不了解社会主义经济体系和它的规律性，是在建设社会主义的困难面前退却。今年2月召开的最近的一次党中央全会把我们的思想工作指向对这些不正确的观点作斗争，并且在我们面前提出了提高国民经济效率的巨大纲领。因此，现在开展了大规模的思想工作，目的是使党员和广大劳动人民群众在实践中更充分地掌握和运用马克思主义经济学说。
    最近，在我们的思想工作方面有一个重要的任务，这个任务就是在解释与我们的生活有关的各种问题时根绝教条主义，因为这个重要的任务至今仍然存在而没有获得彻底解决。同时也有这样一种论调，认为反对教条主义的斗争就是放弃马克思列宁主义的原则。这是完全不符合现实的。
    我们的党要求彻底根除教条主义，而同时强调要有高度的原则性，强调在任何的情况下永远要特别注意马克思列宁主义学说的纯洁性。党总是坚决地使思想部门的工作者去注意当前最迫切的问题，党号召他们尽可能地去了解我们社会的实际情况，并在这方面给予他们以丰富的材料，这些在反对教条主义的斗争中具有非常重要的意义。思想工作者彻底了解党的最主要的决议和当前的问题，而同时依靠着党组织所属的各种委员会来解决这些问题，这种现象在中央和各地的实践中已越来越多了。但是，也有这样一些党员，他们不能分析实际情况，而受到小资产阶级的自发性的影响，放弃了阶级立场和阶级观点。因此，在不断地进行反对教条主义的斗争时，同时也必须注意高度的原则性，用阶级观点对待各种问题，以及始终如一地运用正确的马克思列宁主义的原则。
    大力加强我们在农村的活动是展开宣传解释工作的一个重要任务。所以提出这个任务，不仅是因为要在第二个五年计划期间使社会主义的生产关系在我国农村里占有决定性的优势，而且也是由于迄今我们在这一方面，尤其是某些工作，没有获得充分的发展。现在的问题是首先深入和扩大经济方面的知识。最近各地举行的经济会议就是解决这个问题的有效方法。参加这些会议的是统一农业合作社社员和一些仍然从事个体经营的农民。这些会议主要是讨论当地最需要解决的某个问题，例如生产经费问题、提高劳动生产率的问题等。我们在农村的宣传和鼓动工作的实际情况告诉我们，至今我们对国际问题和我们的对外政策的解释工作仍没有给予应有的注意。同时，经验说明，每一个重大的国际事件对于农村居民都具有很大的影响。虽然我们的报刊有很大一部分是供给农村的，农村几乎每一家都有收音机，而且农村电视网已在扩大，但这还是不够的。宣传员必须在农村里大规模地进行生动的口头的宣传，我们要尽力作到这一点。
    最近，我们党的工作的特点是：我们已开始更多地注意知识分子中间的宣传和教育工作。党的一切活动的出发点是这样，必须把旧知识分子团结在自己周围，并利用他们的才能来建设新社会，同时要培养许多工人和农民出身的新知识分子。改造旧知识分子和教育新知识分子是一个复杂的问题，如果我们能够使他们具有科学的唯物主义世界观，如果我们能够更好地根据我们的学说来解释现代的社会事件和自然现象，以及进行原则性的争论来反对不正确的观点和错误的立场，那末，这个问题将会更顺利地获得解决。
    如果只限于对某些知识分子中的不良现象进行批评，这是非常不够的；需要首先在他们之间进行积极的工作，要同关于民主、自由等一些不正确的观点进行斗争，这些观点是与真正的民主和自由没有任何共同之点的。
    过去几年中，党曾进行了巨大的工作来反对对资产阶级的文化崇拜的不良现象，并加强了社会主义的爱国主义精神的教育工作。从那时起，我们的科学的世界观就在广大的知识界中间不断地扩大和加强。现在，必须在知识分子的队伍中进行巨大的工作，动员他们正确地运用我们的原则，来反对各种虚无主义的倾向。
    近来，每逢党和政府通过了各种重要决议以后，在高等学校、在科学机关和文化机构里就组织广大积极分子会议，在会议上由我党的有声望的活动家阐释已通过的决议的意义。这一办法现在已获得推广，而且行之有效。同时，知识分子的代表日益广泛地被吸收来为党和政府机关准备材料，我们社会主义生活中的重要问题的解决就是研究这些材料的结果。
    理论工作的展开是我国宣传和教育活动展开的重要条件。现在，我们的理论家也面临着一些重大的任务。现在的任务主要是，总结我党在社会主义建设事业中所积累下的丰富经验，指出工业高度发展的、已步入社会主义道路的我国给马克思列宁主义科学带来的那种贡献。在人民民主共和国建立十二年以后的今天，这个任务是一项异常重要的任务，它不仅对于进一步发展马克思列宁主义理论有其意义，而且首先对于我国今后的实际活动也有意义。同时，问题还涉及到对克服个人崇拜和在个人崇拜影响下而流传的理论的有害后果，例如关于阶级斗争的问题。
    现在，我们可以指出科学研究工作，首先是在经济学和历史学方面的进步。经济学家现在已经在注意研究社会主义经济的基本规律和运用它们的方法。在历史科学方面，需要指出已经写好的第一部分捷克斯洛伐克人民的历史，这一部分是用马克思列宁主义学说的观点写成的，而且也需要指出关于我党历史的教科书提纲。这个提纲曾交给科学干部和宣传干部公开讨论过。在哲学方面的情况却是严重的，在这一方面，我们非常需要这样一些新的著作，能够分析今天的社会现象和我们社会中的变化，能够运用辩证唯物主义的观点来说明科学新发现的社会意义，并以此促使加深和进一步扩大我们的唯物主义的科学世界观。
    党对于教育工作的注意也在不断地加强。这是由于我国劳动人民的觉悟提高的结果，现在他们更加积极地参加社会主义的建设，并认识到他们对社会主义和全世界的和平事业的巨大责任。我党有责任领导这个工作，给与这个工作以明确的内容。但是这并不是说，所有的工作只要依靠着党的力量就可以实现。捷克斯洛伐克共产党现在已特别注意这点，就是要使所有的群众和社会组织，首先是职工会和青年的组织，把主要的力量放在教育工作和向劳动群众解释我们建设的意义和目的。
    为了使我党的广泛的教育解释工作获得成功，我们必须学习各兄弟共产党的经验，首先是苏联共产党的经验。我们的根据是：作为世界社会主义体系领导力量的苏联和作为国际工人革命运动中心的苏联共产党，在争取新社会的斗争中积累了异常丰富的经验，在创造性地发展和传播马克思列宁主义思想的事业和教育社会主义的新人的事业方面，也积累下了极其丰富的经验。过去和现在我们所以获得许多成就，我们首先应当感谢伟大的苏联共产党的丰富的经验。
    中国共产党的经验引起我们很大的注意和兴趣。中国共产党丰富了马克思列宁主义的理论，大大促进了它的发展，做出了创造性地解决社会主义建设问题的珍贵的范例。光荣的中国共产党所进行的巨大教育工作，在我国是广泛周知的。这种教育工作使中国人民在争取人民政权胜利的英勇斗争中得到了锻炼，并有效地促进了他们在伟大的中国建设事业中获得更大的成就。
    可以举出一系列的实例，来说明我们在怎样注意地研究中国共产党的经验，特别是在宣传教育工作及其方法方面的经验。最近，“人民日报”关于无产阶级专政的历史经验的两篇文章，引起了人们巨大的兴趣和赞同。这两篇文章被广泛地研究着，许多地方还组织了专门的讨论会。中国共产党第八次代表大会的文件也是人们注意的中心，捷克斯洛伐克的共产党员从这些文件中看到马克思列宁主义的原则性和创造性地发展这一伟大学说的典范。用捷克文和斯洛伐克文出版的毛泽东同志的选集，对于我们的思想工作的发展，有很大的帮助。
    今年，即伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的这一年，我党要广泛展开宣传解释工作，以使我国人民建设新社会的事业获得进一步的成就，并加强我国劳动人民同苏联、伟大的中国和社会主义阵营其他各国人民以及全世界劳动者的国际联系。马克思列宁主义的伟大思想四十年前在苏联获得了胜利，而现在，它已在易北河和太平洋之间的广大地区获得胜利，并照耀着捷克斯洛伐克人民和社会主义阵营的全体人民向社会主义和共产主义前进的道路。
