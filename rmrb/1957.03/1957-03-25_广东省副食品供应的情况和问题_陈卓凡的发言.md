Guangdong Province's Situation and Problems in Subsidiary Food Supply
Speech by Chen Zhuofan

I wholeheartedly endorse Chairman Mao's instructions and the reports of Premier Zhou and other leaders.

I led the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee's inspection team for subsidiary food supply and marketing, spending three months visiting thirteen counties and cities to conduct focused inspections on production, supply, and sales. After arriving in these places, we had extensive contact with people from all walks of life. Based on the feedback and issues from various sources, I present the following brief report:

I. Subsidiary Food Supply Situation

In the third quarter of last year, Guangdong Province experienced a tense situation in subsidiary food supply. Not only was pork and beef difficult to buy, but poultry, eggs, and pond fish were also completely out of stock. Large and medium-sized cities were particularly strained. Citizens lined up all night, with queues often reaching hundreds of people, scrambling and vying for position, creating very poor order. The main reason for this tension was that the speed of production could not keep up with the growing needs of the people's lives. At the same time, after the unified purchase and sale of grain and the collectivization of agriculture, the production leadership emphasized saving grain and increasing grain production, neglecting the importance of sideline production. This resulted in a general decline in the production of pigs, chickens, geese, and ducks, especially due to the lack of feed, leading to the large-scale slaughter of sows and piglets, which severely damaged the pig supply. On the other hand, there were many shortcomings in the business management and distribution work of the commercial departments, coupled with insufficient coordination from the transportation departments, creating many artificial tensions. Both producers and consumers had significant complaints.

Over the past few years, commercial work has made enormous contributions to promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and developing the socialist economy. This is the main aspect. However, in the past, there were also many shortcomings and errors in business operations, such as low purchase prices, excessively large purchase and sales price differences, overly strict and rigid restrictions, and even price gouging and a rude and arrogant attitude towards farmers. The third session of the Provincial People's Congress raised many opinions and criticisms. Since the Provincial Commercial Conference, a series of measures have been taken to improve the work. Purchase prices have been appropriately increased, purchase and sales price differences have been correspondingly reduced, complex specifications have been changed, and on the one hand, a meat rationing system has been adopted for reasonable distribution, while on the other hand, some commodities have been opened up to free markets under state leadership. This has played a positive role in stimulating production, enlivening the market, and promoting the work of state-owned commerce. Therefore, many past shortcomings and errors have been basically reversed. The broad masses of producers have increased their income and are more motivated to produce. Consumers have been spared the trouble of queuing and can buy more varieties of goods. Public sentiment has stabilized, and the tense situation has gradually eased. This can only be said to be a preliminary improvement in the supply of subsidiary foods. There are still many problems in production that are waiting for relevant departments to work hard to solve.

II. Existing Problems and My Recommendations

In order to strive for a basic improvement in the supply of subsidiary foods this year, we must focus on solving the problems existing in its production. Therefore, I would like to talk about the more prominent issues of live pigs and sea fish. Some of these problems are beyond the ability of local authorities to solve and require urgent assistance from relevant central departments.

(1) Problems in Developing Live Pig Production

Currently, the main problem is the lack of piglet supply, resulting in excessively high piglet prices, ranging from 8 jiao to 1.4 yuan per jin, a difference of two to three times the purchase price of live pigs. If a farmer sells 100 jin of live pigs, they can only buy back 40 to 50 jin of piglets. The price difference is too large, and farmers do not consider it worthwhile, which affects their enthusiasm for raising pigs. At the same time, because piglets are expensive, farmers are unwilling to sell their existing large pigs, which creates new difficulties for the acquisition work.

Agricultural cooperatives were only recently established and their financial resources are still weak. There is an extreme shortage of production funds. Under the current task of greatly developing pig production, especially the requirement to rapidly develop sow production in order to gradually bring piglet prices to a reasonable level, agricultural cooperatives and members feel that pig capital is difficult, and there is also a lack of pig feed supply. Relying only on green fodder will not allow pigs to grow meat. There are many difficulties, and farmers feel willing but unable. Especially for sow feed, without sufficient rice bran and soybean cake, it is impossible to ensure the healthy development of piglets, or even prevent a large number of deaths. Therefore, farmers have been requesting the government to provide sufficient piglet loans and to guarantee a sufficient quantity of rice bran and unified bran supply.

Although there are no particular benefits to raising pigs, farmers are still extremely enthusiastic in order to accumulate fertilizer. They request to build more standard pigsties to ensure that the pigs' manure will not flow out. However, fir wood for roofing the pigsties and cement for the flooring (lime cannot withstand acidification erosion, so cement must be used) have been out of stock in the market for a long time and cannot be purchased. Therefore, incidents have occurred where farmers falsely claimed to the water conservancy departments that they were repairing water conservancy projects in order to obtain cement. The water conservancy departments have strong opinions about this. From this, we can understand the farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer and the urgency of their demand for cement. Puning County urgently requests a supply of 3,000 bags of cement for the construction of pigsties (the figure was proposed by the county's commercial bureau chief). Other counties in Jieyang have also made similar requests. Because the local supply of cement is difficult, the problem has not yet been solved. It is hoped that the relevant central departments will provide support.

(2) Fishermen's Production Tool Problems

Guangdong's coastline stretches for over 2,000 kilometers, and there are over a million fishermen. They regard the sea as their home and work on the front lines of national defense. Enemy and puppet ships use all means of coercion and inducement to win them over. Generally, fishermen are able to maintain their position and are not swayed. Since liberation, in response to the government's call to increase production, fishermen have not only extended their daily production time by four hours, but also go to sea as usual in winds of force five or six. The wind and waves cause particularly serious damage to fishing boats, and timely repairs are essential. They request the supply of ramie, jute, canvas, masts, iron wire, and ironwood (imported goods, used for making rudders), which are related to production tools, especially the request for waste iron to be processed into iron nails (iron nails in the market are not suitable for their shipbuilding needs, so they must be made themselves). This request is extremely widespread and very urgent. Guangdong has very little waste iron reserves, and the central government does not allow allocation, so the problem cannot be solved, which will inevitably lead to a reduction in sea fish production. In recent years, many areas have relied on sea fish to meet market needs and reduce the pressure on subsidiary food supply. If sea fish also suffers a reduction in production, not only will the supply of subsidiary foods become further strained, but the threat to fishermen's livelihoods will be even more serious. It is correct for the central government to control the source of hardware and supply it according to urgency and plan, but it is also necessary to give special consideration to special areas. At present, fishermen are eagerly awaiting the supply of waste iron. If it is not resolved in time, the fishing areas may turn into disaster areas. Please consider and handle this promptly.

Many sunken ships from the Anti-Japanese War are in the ports of coastal Guangdong. According to our investigation, there are six in Shantou port alone. It has been twenty years since then, and no one has ever salvaged them. At a time when hardware is severely scarce, it is so unreasonable to let them sink to the bottom of the sea forever! I suggest that the relevant central departments assist in the technical work of salvage and proceed with salvage as soon as possible. In addition to supplying part of the waste iron from the ship to various fishing areas, it will help to alleviate the shortage of hardware.

Please correct any inappropriate suggestions above, and I hope that the relevant central departments will study and handle them. (Attached image)

　　广东省副食品供应的情况和问题
　　陈卓凡的发言
    我对毛主席的指示周总理及各首长的报告表示衷心拥护。
    我曾带领广东省人民委员会副食品供销工作检查组，经过三个月的时间，到过十三个县市，从生产、供应、销售各方面进行重点检查。我们到达地方之后，和各界人民有过广泛的接触，根据各方面反映情况和问题概略的报告如下：
    一、副食品供应情况
    广东省去年第三季度，曾出现副食品供应紧张情况，不但猪肉牛肉不易买到，即家禽蛋品、塘鱼亦全面脱销，特别大中城市显得格外紧张，市民彻夜排长龙，每队多至数百人，争先恐后，秩序很不好，造成紧张原因：主要是由于生产速度赶不上人民生活日益增长的需要，同时在粮食统购统销及农业合作化以后，生产领导部门强调节约粮食，多打粮食，忽视副业生产的重要性，因此造成猪、鸡、鹅、鸭普遍减产，特别是饲料缺乏，大量宰杀母猪和小猪，使猪源受到严重的破坏。在另一方面由于商业部门经营管理和分配工作存在不少缺点，兼之运输部门又配合得不够，造成许多人为的紧张，生产和消费者都有很大的意见。
    几年来商业工作对于促进城乡物资交流，发展社会主义经济作出了巨大的贡献，这是主要的一面，但过去一些时期，业务上亦存在不少缺点和错误，如收购价格偏低、购销差价太大、限制过严过死，甚至压级压价、对待农民傲慢粗暴等恶劣作风，省人代会第三次会议曾提出不少的意见和批评，自省商业会议召开后，对工作的改进采取一系列的措施，收购价格作了适当提高，购销差价相应缩小，复杂规格已有改变，一面采取肉食凭证供应、作合理的分配。一面将部分商品开放国家领导下的自由市场，这样对于刺激生产、活跃市场以及促进国营商业工作起了积极作用，因此过去许多缺点和错误，基本上已经扭转过来，广大生产者增加了收入，生产更有劲头，消费者免了排队麻烦，而且可以买到更多的品种，群众情绪安定，紧张情况亦逐渐缓和，这只能说副食品供应有了初步的好转。尚有许多生产上存在的问题，正待有关部门努力解决。二、存在的问题和我的建议
    为了争取本年度副食品供应工作基本好转，必须着重解决它生产上存在的问题，因此，我想谈一谈比较突出的生猪和海鱼问题，这些问题有的是地方无力解决，而急待中央有关部门协助处理的。
    （一）发展生猪生产问题
    目前主要是缺乏小猪供应，造成小猪价格过高，每斤八角至一元四角不等，与生猪收购价相差二至三倍，如出卖一百斤生猪，只能买回小猪四十至五十斤，差价太大，农民认为不合算，影响养猪积极性。同时由于小猪价贵农民现有的大猪亦不愿出卖，使收购工作出现了新的困难。
    农业社建社不久，家底还薄，生产资金极感缺乏，在目前要求大量发展生猪的任务，特别是要求迅速发展母猪生产，才能使小猪价格逐渐趋于合理的情况下，农业社和社员均感猪本困难，同时猪糠亦缺乏供应，只靠青饲料，猪是不会长肉的。困难很多，农民感到有心无力，尤其是母猪饲料如无足够的米糠豆饼，无法保证小猪发育壮健，甚或因此造成大量死亡。所以农民纷纷要求政府给予充分小猪贷款，并要求保证足够数量的米糠和统糠供应。
    虽然养猪无什么好处，但为了积肥，农民仍极热心，要求建筑较合标准的猪舍，以保证猪的粪尿不会外流，可是用作猪舍上盖的杉木及打地面的洋灰（石灰是经不起酸化侵蚀，故须用洋灰），市上脱销已久，无从购到，因此发生农民向水利部门伪称修理水利，骗取洋灰情事，水利部门对此，甚有意见，由此可以理解到农民养猪积肥的热情及要求洋灰的迫切。普宁县迫切要求供应洋灰三千包，作为建筑猪舍之用（数字是该县商业局长提出的），揭阳其他各县亦同样提出要求。因地方洋灰供应困难，至今未能解决，希望中央有关部门予以支持。
        （二）渔民生产工具问题
    广东海岸线长达二千余公里，渔民数逾百万，他们视海如家，工作在国防前哨，敌伪舰艇对于他们威迫利诱，极尽争取能事，一般渔民尚能站稳立场，不为所动。解放以来，渔民为响应政府增产号召，不但把每天生产时间延长四小时，就是五级六级的风，仍照常出海，风吹浪打，渔船损害格外严重，及时修理是十分必要的。他们要求供应与生产工具有关的黄麻、青麻、帆布、船桅、铁丝、坤甸木（进口货，做船舵用的），尤其是要求废铁加工铁钉（市上铁钉不适合他们造船之用，故须自制），作为修造渔船之用，此种要求极其普遍而且非常迫切。广东废铁存量极少，中央又不准拨给，因此问题无从解决，势必造成海鱼减产。年来不少地区是靠着海鱼来满足市场需要，以减少副食品供应紧张的压力。万一海鱼又闹减产，不但副食品供应会进一步紧张，威胁渔民生活尤为严重。中央掌握五金货源分别缓急，作计划的供应，这是正确的，但对特殊地区，应作特殊照顾亦属必要，目下渔民盼望废铁接济万分迫切，如不及时解决，渔区可能会变成灾区，请迅速考虑处理。
    广东沿海各港口不少抗日战争时期被炸沉的轮船，据我们调查，只汕头港口就有六艘，至今时隔二十载，从无进行打捞者，当此五金严重缺货的今天，竟让它永沉海底，这是多么不合理呢？我建议中央有关部门协助打捞技术工作，从速进行打捞，除把该轮部分废铁供应各渔区外，对于缓和五金供应紧张，是有帮助的。
    以上建议是否有当，请委员们指正并望中央有关部门研究处理。（附图片）
