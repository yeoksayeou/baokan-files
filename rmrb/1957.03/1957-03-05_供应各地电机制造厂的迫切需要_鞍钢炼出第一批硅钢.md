Xinhua News Agency Report: In late February, the Anshan Iron and Steel No. 1 Steel Plant produced the first batch of two different specifications of silicon steel using large open-hearth furnaces. According to the plan, Anshan Iron and Steel is preparing to produce thousands of tons of silicon steel this year, which will be rolled into silicon steel sheets to support motor manufacturing plants across the country.

Silicon steel is a relatively difficult-to-refine high-quality alloy steel. It requires low sulfur content, high temperature, and many deoxidizing materials, making it difficult to control the composition. However, in order to support the urgent needs of motor manufacturing plants in Shanghai, Shenyang, Tianjin, Harbin, and other places, the plant's technicians and relevant departments of the company have been actively preparing for formal production since January. They studied the experience of foreign open-hearth furnace smelting of silicon steel and the situation of domestic small open-hearth and electric furnace smelting, analyzed the characteristics of large open-hearth furnaces, specifically formulated the operation methods for smelting silicon steel, and organized steelmaking workers to learn the operation techniques.

Batch production of silicon steel using large open-hearth furnaces can not only greatly supply the urgent needs of China's motor manufacturing plants and save foreign exchange, but also the cost is much lower than silicon steel smelted by small open-hearth and electric furnaces. After silicon steel is rolled by the primary rolling mill and thin plate mill, it becomes silicon steel sheet.

    供应各地电机制造厂的迫切需要
    鞍钢炼出第一批硅钢
    据新华社讯  2月下旬，鞍钢第一炼钢厂用大型平炉生产了第一批两种不同规格的硅钢。按照计划，鞍钢今年准备生产数千吨硅钢，轧制成硅钢片以后，支援全国各地电机制造厂。
    硅钢是一种比较难炼的优质合金钢，它含硫的要求低，温度需要高，脱氧材料多，因此成分很难控制。但是，为了支援上海、沈阳、天津、哈尔滨等地电机制造厂的迫切需要，这个厂的技术人员和公司有关部门从1月份起，就积极进行正式生产的准备工作。他们研究国外平炉冶炼硅钢的经验和国内小型平炉、电炉冶炼的情况，分析大型平炉的特点，具体拟定了冶炼硅钢的操作方法，又组织炼钢工人学习了操作技术。
    用大型平炉成批生产硅钢，不仅可以大量地供应我国电机制造厂的急需，节省外汇，而且它的成本比用小型平炉、电炉冶炼的硅钢低得多。硅钢经过初轧厂、薄板厂轧制以后就成为硅钢片。
