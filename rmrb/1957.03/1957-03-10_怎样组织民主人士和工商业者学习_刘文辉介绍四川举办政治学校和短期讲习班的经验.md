How to Organize Democratic Personages and Industrialists and Businessmen to Study
Liu Wenhui Introduces Sichuan's Experience in Running Political Schools and Short-Term Training Classes

I fully endorse Chairman Mao's speech and the reports by Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Li, and I agree with the Standing Committee's work report. I will implement them in my future work. Now, I would like to report to the congress on the situation of political schools for democratic personages and short-term training classes for industrialists and businessmen in Sichuan Province.

After the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) issued the "Decision on Organizing Political and Theoretical Studies for Democratic Personages and Industrialists and Businessmen" last year, CPPCC local organizations at all levels in Sichuan, based on the provisions and spirit of the decision, established vocational political schools in forty cities and counties. In addition, Chongqing established a political school, whose first class has already graduated, and an industrial and commercial political school, which has completed two classes and is now starting its third. Seventeen industrial and commercial training classes have been established in Chengdu, Zigong, and various special districts, most of which have run two sessions.

Our work was carried out under the guidance of the National Committee of the CPPCC and the direct leadership of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). We adopted the teaching policy of "studying theory, linking with practice, and improving ideological understanding," implemented the principles of voluntariness, consciousness, and free debate, and, through complex and meticulous work, achieved certain results and gained some experience.

Implement the Principles of Voluntariness, Consciousness, and Free Debate

This is our first time running this type of school. There are no established rules to follow and no ready-made experiences to draw upon. We are advancing through exploration. In our work practice, we deeply realize that using education and learning to handle class contradictions and class struggles is the most correct approach in the new situation; and to do a good job in education and learning, correctly implementing the "three freedoms" principles proposed by the CPPCC National Committee is a crucial key. Our achievements in educational work are precisely due to the active implementation of the "three freedoms" principles.

However, putting the "three freedoms" principles into practice is not as simple as imagined. In our work practice, it was a process of effort and a journey with detours. In the beginning, neither the cadres nor the students had a clear understanding of the spirit of the "three freedoms" principles. For example, some cadres understood "three freedoms" as complete freedom, where everything could be done casually; some felt this was wrong, but were afraid of violating the principle of freedom if they tried to manage it; some were afraid that it would be too loose to achieve the expected learning results, so there was not enough freedom at the beginning of the study; some did not manage anything at all, failing to distinguish between "strict rules and regulations" and necessary systems, nor did they clearly define the boundaries between freedom and inspiration and education. Some students also had concerns about helping each other learn; some people infringed on others' learning, and others did not dare to interfere; some asked to study at night; some wanted to take books to places far away from the school to read. These situations show that implementing the "three freedoms" principles is not a simple matter. It must be pointed out that this is not a problem with the principles themselves, but with the method of implementing the principles. The main key lies with the cadres. Some cadres do not have a comprehensive and profound understanding of the Party and government's policies, do not recognize the characteristics of this type of school, and do not sufficiently estimate the eagerness of general students to learn. In addition, they misunderstood the "three freedoms" principles as laissez-faire, thereby abandoning leadership, which led to various incorrect views among a few students. Through learning and practice, the cadres' understanding was improved. At the same time, the working method of the mass line was adhered to, and the students were asked about the situation and their opinions. The leadership adopted the form of a report meeting, neither explicitly pointing out individuals nor certain phenomena, but repeatedly explaining the principles from the positive side. In this way, the temporary ideological confusion was overcome, and the students' consciousness and enthusiasm for learning were enhanced. This shows that while implementing the "three freedoms" principles, leadership must be strengthened, and laissez-faire should never be allowed. Leadership and the "three freedoms" principles are not contradictory. On the contrary, with leadership, the "three freedoms" principles can be correctly implemented. Of course, it is also very important to avoid being rigid in leadership methods and to conduct leadership in the spirit of the "three freedoms" principles.

Appropriately Implement the Policy of Linking Theory with Practice

In implementing the "three freedoms" principles, how to implement the teaching policy of linking theory with practice is also a difficult problem to solve. Our main requirement for learning is to initially grasp the Marxist-Leninist stance, viewpoints, and methods, and gradually eliminate capitalist ideology and establish socialist ideology. This is a serious process of ideological struggle, coupled with some unnecessary concerns. Therefore, while students demand to learn and change their way of thinking and working, they are also afraid of exposing ideological contradictions. This has created a serious obstacle to the implementation of linking theory with practice, thereby affecting the implementation of the entire teaching policy. On this key issue, we have gradually resolved it in accordance with the spirit of the "three freedoms" principles. In the beginning, some people believed that studying Marxism-Leninism meant reading more Marxist-Leninist works; some said they simply could not link it with practice; some believed that linking with practice meant checking their own thoughts, and they immediately became nervous when it was mentioned. Therefore, it is not appropriate to emphasize linking theory with practice too early or excessively. The comrades in charge of our school attach great importance to linking theory with practice. However, they never require each student to immediately link it with themselves, but only ask how to use the Marxist-Leninist viewpoints and methods to solve specific problems. They announced to the students that they could link with practice or not, depending on each person's willingness. At the same time, they pointed out that the scope of linking could be expanded as much as possible, linking with anything from ancient and modern times, both domestic and foreign, but they also explained to everyone that it is best to link with things they are familiar with. In this way, unnecessary tension was avoided, and gradually and naturally, it was linked to their own thoughts and work. During the learning process, everyone was also called together to discuss learning methods and experiences, and good ones were affirmed, while bad ones were not criticized for the time being. Before graduation, the school announced long ago that there would be no exams, and even whether or not to write心得(personal reflections) was up to each person's willingness. However, when the Chongqing CPPCC Political School graduated this term, more than 80% wrote心得(personal reflections), and they were linked to their own ideological realities and work realities. We believe that this approach is consistent with the main method of persuasion and education currently used within the united front to resolve contradictions and strengthen unity. Therefore, I have come to understand that the "three freedoms" principles are a further embodiment of the spirit of the Party's united front policy in learning. Facts have proved that this approach can achieve good results, and it also proves that this approach meets the current objective needs.

Promote Strengths, Correct Shortcomings, and Better Organize Learning

Through this period of educational work, after we personally learned from the students, their ideological progress is very significant. For example, a professor in the history department of a university said that in the past, his understanding of the Party and Party members was not enough, and he was suspicious, always worrying that the Party did not trust him, and always "leaving half a sentence at the tip of his tongue," speaking hesitantly, and looking at the faces of Party members. After this study, I believe in the Party, I will talk about everything, and I must say what I think in the future, and I am no longer afraid. I believe that if I say something wrong, the Party will help me; if I don't say it, I will always be wrong. Another famous dentist said that through learning, my outlook on life has changed, and I will work hard to serve the people in the future. He said that when he returns to his post, he will improve the relationship between parties and between the Party and the masses, mobilize the masses, do a good job in saving, and use less medicine but be able to cure patients, use less foreign medicine, and use more domestic medicine. While he was at school, he also proactively treated many dental diseases for his classmates. The director of a nursery who has been engaged in child work for thirty years said that the first thing I encountered when I returned to the nursery this time was the issue of increasing production and practicing economy. There were more than eighty cadres in the entire nursery, and more than thirty of them had to be cut. There were hundreds of children in the entire nursery. In the past, I would have disagreed no matter how hard I tried. Now I am not like that. I will try my best to tighten up. A twenty-nine-year-old female student whose husband runs a machine factory, has six children, and her family has more than 2,000 yuan of fixed interest every year, now works as a third-grade technician at the Chongqing State-owned Fire Fighting Equipment Factory and was elected as a district people's representative representing the workers. She said: When I studied the issue of capitalist blood and filth in Chapter 6 of the political common sense textbook this time, I really had some resistance in my heart. Then, after visiting and seeing the hardship of the miners, and recalling the situation of the workers in the old society, my husband and I ran a flour mill and a paper mill, and the workers worked ten hours a day and had to work overtime, which was cruel enough. Therefore, I have thought through the issue of blood and filth. She said that when she returned to the workshop this time to turn screws, the factory's quota was more than 300 per day. She said that she started with 280, and now she has reached 410, while the most other turners are 240. She said that she is determined not to waste a minute or a second. She also introduced the situation of a female classmate, saying that she was not so enthusiastic when she started learning. When the issue of capitalist blood and filth was mentioned, she was even more unwilling to listen. When reading documents, she would skip the words "blood and filth" and not want to read on. After studying, she understood clearly. This time, she got the certificate when she graduated. She told me that this was the happiest thing in her life. She kept the certificate without opening it all the time. She said that the work in the enterprise is the real exam, and I will only open it when I have achieved success in my work. In the first class of the Chengdu Industrial and Commercial Training Class, 400 people returned to their jobs after graduation, and more than 300 of them performed well, while only 20 of them did not perform well. Of the fifty people from Guanxian, Pengxian, and Xinfan counties who participated in the Wenjiang Special District Industrial and Commercial Training Class, 49 of them worked very well after returning. The above examples show that using education and learning to deal with class contradictions and class struggles within the united front is the most effective.

However, there are still shortcomings in the education process: (1) Some places did not clearly explain the "three freedoms" principles in time when school started, nor did they organize students to discuss and eliminate concerns, so they took some detours. (2) Most of the teachers are part-time, and they cannot fully understand the ideological situation of the students. In the future, we should pay attention to gradually cultivating full-time teachers. (3) The teachers' lectures are not sufficiently linked to the reality, and they cannot meet the needs of the students. In the future, we should ask more comrades from the financial and economic departments to give reports on courses such as political economics. (4) The lectures are somewhat loose at the beginning and tight at the end. In the future, we should pay attention to balance; the key is not to have too many problems, but to go deep, focusing on the ideological situation of the students and solving problems. (5) The tutoring work is not enough. In the future, we should strengthen the tutoring force and appropriately increase the number of tutors, especially for students in industrial and commercial political schools or industrial and commercial training classes. In the future, there will be more and more small industrialists and businessmen, so tutoring must be strengthened. (6) Democratic party students have carried out mass work in their studies and have played a certain backbone role; however, there are also individual democratic party students who only talk to their own comrades, which affects the emotions of other students, who think they are small sects. This is worth noting in the future.

Finally, I want to especially mention that international friends pay close attention to the study of industrialists and businessmen. Taking the Chongqing Industrial and Commercial Political School as an example, there have been four groups of international friends visiting Chongqing, including friends from the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary, India, and other countries, who have visited the school and also talked to students individually. They mainly raised two questions: (1) Why can capitalists accept transformation, cooperate with the Communist Party, and talk about friendship? (2) Why can capitalists, after studying, engage in production and management for the Communist Party and serve the people? Therefore, they believe that there must be another set of teaching methods. The interviewed students replied that because they have received appropriate arrangements politically and economically, they have no problems with their current lives and have a bright future. Therefore, they love the Communist Party and love the enterprise. Doing a good job in the enterprise is not only good for the country and the people, but also good for themselves. Although the nature of the enterprise is different after joint ownership, as long as they study, understand the principles, and establish a correct stance and viewpoints, they will actively do a good job in the enterprise. The person in charge of the school also told them that the resolution of class contradictions is mainly through life arrangements and ideological education. There is resistance at the beginning of the study. First, eliminate concerns, and then unify understanding through free discussion, and solve contradictions ideologically. International friends think this method is very good, and finally said that they have learned Marxism-Leninism from the Chinese business community. This shows that international friends attach great importance to the peaceful transformation policy we have adopted for capitalist industry and commerce and the specific measures to implement this policy. It also shows that the brilliant achievements made by the Party and Chairman Mao in combining Marxism-Leninism with China's specific conditions have not only enriched the arsenal of Marxist-Leninist theory, but also provided shining examples for the practice of the world communist movement.

We know that ideological transformation is a long-term task, which must be transformed not only in study, but more importantly in work practice. However, the above facts prove that short-term study can not only initially establish socialist ideology in the minds of students, but also is a driving force for their active work in the future. In order to give full play to the positive role of the people's democratic united front, we must sum up experience, promote strengths, correct shortcomings, and better organize people from all walks of life and industrialists and businessmen to study, unite all forces that can be united, mobilize all positive factors, and strive together to build our country into a great socialist country as quickly as possible!

    怎样组织民主人士和工商业者学习
    刘文辉介绍四川举办政治学校和短期讲习班的经验
    我完全拥护毛主席的讲话和周总理、李副总理的报告，同意常务委员会的工作报告。并在今后工作中贯彻执行。现在，我向大会报告一下四川省各界民主人士政治学校和工商业者短期讲习班的情况。
    去年全国委员会“关于组织各界民主人士和工商业者进行政治学习和理论学习的决定”公布以后，四川各级政协地方组织，便根据决定的规定和精神，除在四十个市、县开办了业余政治学校外，重庆市开办一所政治学校，第一期已经结业，一所工商政治学校，已办完两期，现在第三期已经开学，在成都市、自贡市和各个专区开办了十七个工商讲习班，一般都办了两期。
    我们的工作，是在中国人民政协全国委员会的指导和中共四川省委员会的直接领导下进行的。采取了“学习理论，联系实际，提高思想认识”的教学方针，贯彻了自愿、自觉、自由争辩的原则，通过复杂细致的工作，取得了一定的成绩，并摸索到点滴的经验。
    贯彻执行自愿、自觉、自由争辩的原则
    我们办这类型的学校，还是头一次，既无陈规可循，也无现成的经验可资吸取，是在摸索中前进的。在工作实践中，我们深刻认识到，在新形势下，用教育和学习的方法来处理阶级矛盾和阶级斗争是最正确的方针；而要搞好教育学习，正确贯彻政协全委会提出的“三自”原则，又是一个重要关键。我们在教育工作中的成绩，正是由于积极地贯彻“三自”原则而取得的。
    但是把“三自”原则贯彻到实际中去，并不是如想像的那样简单，在工作实践中，是经过一个努力的过程并走过一段弯路的。在开始，无论是干部或学员，对于
  “三自”原则的精神，认识都不够明确。如有的干部把“三自”理解为完全自由，一切可以随便；有的认为这不对，但是要管又怕违反自由的原则；有的怕太松了，收不到预期的学习效果，因而学习开始时，自由有些不够；有的一切不管，没有把“清规戒律”和必要的制度区别开来，也没有把自由和启发、教育的界限划清。有的学员对互相帮助学习也有顾虑；有些人侵犯了别人的学习，别人也不敢干涉；有的要求晚上学习；有的要把书拿到离学校很远的地方去看。这些情况，说明贯彻“三自”原则不是简单的事情。必须指出，这不是原则本身的问题，问题在于贯彻原则的方法。其中主要关键还在干部方面，有些干部对于党和政府的方针政策，没有全面深刻的认识，没有认清这种学校的特点，对一般学员要求学习的殷切心情，没有足够估计，加上把“三自”原则误解为放任自流，因而放弃领导，以致在少数学员中也就滋生了各种不正确的看法。通过学习和实践，提高了干部的认识，同时，坚持了群众路线的工作方法，向学员了解情况，征求意见，由领导上采取报告会的形式，既不明白指出人，也不指出某些现象，只从正面反复讲清道理，于此，克服了思想上一时的混乱现象，增强了学习的自觉性、积极性。这说明在贯彻“三自”原则的同时，必须加强领导，决不应放任自流。领导与“三自”原则并不矛盾，相反的，有了领导才能正确地贯彻“三自”原则。当然，在领导方法上必须避免生硬，要本着“三自”原则的精神，去进行领导，这也是很重要的。
    恰当地实行理论联系实际的方针
    在执行“三自”原则上，如何贯彻理论与实际联系的教学方针，这也是不易解决的问题。我们对学习的主要要求，是初步掌握马列主义的立场、观点、方法，逐步破除资本主义思想，建立社会主义思想，这是一个严重的思想斗争过程，加上某些不必要的顾虑，因此，学员们一面要求学习，改变思想方法、工作方法，另一面又怕揭露思想上的矛盾。这就对于贯彻理论联系实际产生了严重的阻碍，从而影响到整个教学方针的贯彻。在这一关键性的问题上，我们一本“三自”原则的精神，逐步予以解决。开始，有的人认为学习马列主义就是多读马列主义著作；有的表示我就不会联系实际；有的认为联系实际就是检查思想，一提到联系实际就马上紧张起来。因此，过早或过分强调理论联系实际，是不适宜的。我们学校负责同志对于理论联系实际，非常重视。但是，决不要求每个学员立刻联系自己，只要求如何运用马列主义的观点、方法来解决具体问题。向学员们宣布，可以联系实际，也可以不联系实际，随各人自愿。同时，指出联系的范围，可以尽量扩大，中外古今均可联系，但也向大家说明，最好是联系自己熟悉的东西。这样，就避免了不必要的紧张，并逐渐自然而然地联系到自己的思想和工作了。在学习过程中，还召集大家座谈学习方法、经验，好的加以肯定，不好的暂时不加批判。在结业之前，学校早就宣布不考试，就连写不写心得也听各人自愿，而重庆政协政治学校本期结业时，写心得的占80％以上，并且联系了自己的思想实际和工作实际。我们认为这种作法，与当前统一战线内部解决矛盾、加强团结所采用的说服教育的主要方法，是相符合的，因此，我体会到“三自”原则正是党的统战政策精神在学习方面进一步的体现。事实证明，这样作能收到良好的效果，也证明，这种作法适合当前的客观需要。
    发扬优点，改正缺点，更好地组织学习
    通过这一时期的教育工作，经我们亲自向学员们了解，他们思想上的进步是很显著的。例如：一位大学历史系的教授说，过去对党和党员认识不够，疑神疑鬼，总担心党不相信我，总是“话到口边留半句”，说话吞吞吐吐，看党员的脸色。经过这次学习，我相信党了，有话必谈，以后一定要说出自己的话，不再怕了。我相信说错了，党会帮助我；不说，会永远错下去。又有一位有名的牙科医师说，通过学习，改变了我的人生观，今后要努力为人民服务。他表示回到自己岗位，要搞好党派间、党群间的关系，带动群众，搞好节约，对病人要少用药而能医好病，少用外来药品，多用国产药品。他在学校时，还主动为同学治好了不少牙病。一位搞了三十年儿童工作的托儿所所长说，我这次回到托儿所，首先碰到的就是增产节约的问题，全所原有八十多个干部，要减去三十余人，全所有几百儿童，要在过去，我拼命也是不同意的。现在我不是这样了，我要尽量设法紧缩。一位二十九岁的女学员，她的爱人是开机器厂的，有六个小孩子，家里每年有二千多元的定息，现在重庆国营消防器械厂作三级技工，并当选为代表工人的区人民代表。她说：我这次在学校学习到政治常识课本第六章资本血污问题时，心里实在有些抵触。继而经过参观，看到矿井工人的艰苦，又回忆旧社会工人的情况，我同爱人搞过面粉厂、造纸厂，工人每天十小时劳动，还要加班加点，也就够残忍了。因此，我对血污问题想通了。她这次回到车间车螺丝，厂的定额，每天要作三百多个，她说，开始作二百八十个，现在达到四百一十个，其他车工最多的二百四十个。她说，我决心不把时间浪费一分一秒。她还介绍了一位女同学的情况，说，她开始学习时，并不那样热情，提到资本血污，她更不愿意听，读文件，看到血污两个字，她就把它跳过，不愿看下去，经过学习，她认识清楚了。这次结业，她拿到证书，她告诉我这是平生最愉快的事。她把证书放着，始终未打开，她说，企业工作中才真正算考试，我要待工作有成绩才打开。成都工商讲习班第一期四百人，结业后回到工作岗位，表现好的有三百余人，不好的只有二十人。灌县、彭县、新繁三县参加温江专区工商讲习班学习的五十人，有四十九人回去都工作很好。以上这些事例，说明用教育和学习的方法处理统一战线内部的阶级矛盾和阶级斗争是最有成效的。
    但是，在教育工作过程中，也还存在着缺点：（一）有的地方在开学时没有把“三自”原则及时交代清楚，也没有组织学员讨论，扫清顾虑，因而走了一些弯路。（二）教员多数系兼职，不能充分了解学员思想情况，今后应注意逐步培养专职教员。（三）教员讲课联系现实情况不够，不能满足学员需要，今后对于如政治经济学这类课程要多请财经部门的同志作报告。（四）课程讲授有些前松后紧的情况，今后应注意均衡；抓问题不在多，要深入，重在针对学员思想情况，解决问题。（五）辅导工作不够，今后要加强辅导力量，适当增加辅导人员，特别是工商政治学校或工商讲习班的学员，以后小型工商业者越来越多，更须加强辅导。（六）民主党派学员在学习中展开了联系群众工作，起到了一定的骨干作用；但也有个别的民主党派学员只找自己同志谈话，影响其他同学的情绪，认为是小宗派。今后值得注意。
    最后，我要特别谈到，国际友人对于工商业者的学习，非常注意。拿重庆工商政治学校来说，到重庆的国际友人曾经有四批，包括苏联、波兰、匈牙利、印度等国的友人，都到学校访问，还同学员个别谈话，他们主要地提出两个问题：（一）资本家为什么能接受改造，能同共产党合作，讲朋友？（二）为什么资本家经过学习能够为共产党搞生产、经营，能够为人民服务？因此，认为一定有另一套教学方法。被访问的学员答复他们，因为政治上、经济上都得到适当安排，目前生活无问题，而且有美好的前途，因此，热爱共产党，热爱企业。搞好企业不仅对国家、对人民有好处，就对自己也有好处。虽然，合营后，企业的性质不同，只要经过学习，弄清道理，树立了正确的立场、观点，就会积极地去搞好企业。学校负责人也向他们说，阶级矛盾的解决，主要是通过生活安排和思想教育。学习开始是有抵触的，首先解除顾虑，通过自由讨论，便能统一认识，从思想上解决矛盾。国际友人认为这个方法很好，最后并说从中国工商界学习了马列主义。这说明国际友人对于我们对资本主义工商业所采用的和平改造政策和贯彻这种政策的具体措施是非常重视的，也说明党和毛主席结合中国具体情况，运用马克思列宁主义所取得的辉煌成就，不仅丰富了马克思列宁主义理论的武库，而且给世界共产主义运动的实践提供了光辉的事例。
    我们知道，思想改造是长期的工作，不仅要在学习中改造，更重要的是在工作实践中改造。但是，上述事实证明：短期学习，不但能够使社会主义思想在学员的思想中初步建立，而且是他们今后积极工作的推动力量。为了充分发挥人民民主统一战线的积极作用，我们必须总结经验，发扬优点，改正缺点，更好地组织各界民主人士和工商业者进行学习，团结一切可能团结的力量，调动一切积极因素，为尽可能地迅速地把我国建成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而共同奋斗！
