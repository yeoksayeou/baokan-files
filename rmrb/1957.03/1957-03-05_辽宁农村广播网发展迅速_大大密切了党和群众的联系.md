    Liaoning Rural Broadcasting Network Develops Rapidly
    Greatly Closes the Ties Between the Party and the Masses

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The rural broadcasting network in Liaoning Province has developed very rapidly in the past year. All forty-three counties (banners) in the province have established rural broadcasting stations; the vast majority of cities have also established broadcasting stations to serve farmers in the suburbs. About 60% of the townships in the province can now listen to the broadcast in a timely manner.

    The construction of the rural broadcasting network has been enthusiastically supported by the broad masses of farmers. In addition to providing timely manpower and transportation, the farmers also paid for loudspeakers and iron wire for branch lines. Local Party committees and government leading departments are also very concerned about the construction of the broadcasting network. The CPC Liaoning Provincial Committee and the county Party committees helped the radio stations and broadcasting stations formulate network construction plans; the government purchased a complete set of in-station equipment for each broadcasting station and equipped them with staff. The Party and government leaders of some counties personally led the network construction work.

    The establishment of the provincial broadcasting network has further strengthened the ties between the Party and government leading organs and the broad masses of farmers. Every day, the broadcasting stations rebroadcast important news reports from the Central People's Broadcasting Station and the provincial radio station to their listeners. When the Liaoning People's Broadcasting Station broadcast the first day of rural broadcasting programs, Chu Fengqi, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee, spoke to the broad masses of farmers about production and rural work through this program. Responsible comrades of the Party and government in the county also often talked to the farmers about production and rural life through broadcasting.

    The farmers regard the loudspeakers as teachers and good friends. Some members of Tuchengzi Township in Beipiao County once said after listening to the broadcast about the autumn harvest distribution policy: Our cooperative has been running for a year or two, and we don't know how to distribute it reasonably; now we understand it. The members all call the loudspeaker a "little teacher."

    Recently, the Third Provincial Rural Broadcasting Work Conference held by Liaoning People's Broadcasting Station determined that each station should strive to run programs well and maintain the lines well. It was also decided that in the future, if the masses request and voluntarily pay for it, the equipment can be resolved, and the principle of "first to the village cooperative, then to the household courtyard" is not violated, loudspeakers and lines can continue to be developed.

    辽宁农村广播网发展迅速
    大大密切了党和群众的联系
    本报讯  辽宁省的农村广播网在过去一年里发展非常迅速。全省的四十三个县（旗）都建立了农村广播站；绝大部分的市也都建立了为郊区农民服务的广播站。全省已有60％左右的乡可以及时收听广播。
    在进行农村广播网的建设中，受到广大农民热情地支持。农民们除了及时供应人力和运输力量以外，还自己拿钱买喇叭和架支线用的铁线等。地方党委和政府各领导部门也很关怀广播网的建设工作。中共辽宁省委和各县县委帮助广播电台和广播站制定了建网规划；政府给各广播站购买了全套的站内设备，并配备了工作人员。有些县的党政领导同志亲自领导了建网工作。
    全省广播网的建立，进一步密切了党政领导机关和广大农民的联系。广播站每天都把中央人民广播电台和省电台的重要新闻报道转播给自己的听众。当辽宁人民广播电台举办的对农村广播节目第一天广播时，省委农村工作部褚凤岐部长就通过这个节目和广大的农民谈了有关生产和农村工作的一些问题。县里的一些党政负责同志也经常通过广播和农民们谈生产和农村生活。
    农民们把广播喇叭当成老师和好朋友看待。北票县土城子乡的一些社员有一次在听了广播里谈的秋收分配政策以后说：咱们社搞了一两年了，也不知道怎样分配才合理；这回才明白了。社员们都称喇叭是小先生。
    最近，辽宁人民广播电台召开的第三次全省农村广播工作会议确定：各站要努力办好节目、维护好线路。并决定今后在群众要求并自愿出钱，器材能够解决，不违反先到村社后到院户的原则，可继续发展喇叭和线路。 （宁音）
