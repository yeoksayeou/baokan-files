Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, March 15th: The local organizations of various democratic parties in Chongqing are actively assisting the Chongqing municipal-level Party organizations of the Chinese Communist Party in inspecting the united front work.

The Chongqing municipal-level leading bodies of the China Democratic League, the Jiusan Society, the China Democratic National Construction Association, and the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, etc., all issued notices in advance, requiring all grassroots organizations and members to reflect their opinions and requests to the CCP organizations in their respective units in the spirit of "saying everything you know and saying it without reservation."

The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association specifically held two symposiums, inviting members serving as managers and deputy managers in state-owned specialized companies, as well as those serving as section chiefs in government offices and enterprises, to discuss the situation and problems of cooperative work relations. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party also convened a symposium of members serving as hospital directors, engineers, and other positions, as well as branch leaders, to discuss the achievements and shortcomings in the united front in hospitals and enterprises. In order to collect members' opinions more widely, the China Democratic League, the Jiusan Society, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and other organizations also sent cadres to government offices, hospitals, enterprises, and members' homes, using small-scale symposiums or individual interviews to solicit problems and opinions that members felt on weekdays.

In government offices, schools, and enterprises where the united front work inspection started earlier, the grassroots organizations of various democratic parties have already collected many opinions and suggestions on united front work. The Chongqing municipal-level organizations of various democratic parties have handed over the various opinions and suggestions they have collected to the Chongqing municipal-level Party organizations of the Chinese Communist Party to help them improve their work.

The Chongqing municipal-level Party organizations of the Chinese Communist Party began a comprehensive inspection of the united front work in mid-February. At present, most government offices, schools, and enterprises are inspecting the cooperative work relations between Party members and non-Party figures in their respective units, and some units have completed the inspection. At the "Bi-Weekly Symposium" held by various democratic parties and people's organizations in late February, the person in charge of the United Front Work Department of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party spoke with the attendees about the city's progress in inspecting the united front work, expressing a welcome to the organizations of various democratic parties in various units to actively assist the Chinese Communist Party organizations in their respective units in doing a good job in this inspection.

    民建会重庆市委员会特地召开两次座谈会，分别邀集在国营专业公司担任经理、副经理及机关、企业中担任科长级职务的成员座谈合作共事关系的情况和问题。农工民主党重庆市委员会也召集了担任医院院长、工程师等职务的成员及支部负责人座谈了目前医院和企业中统一战线中的成绩和缺点。为更广泛地收集成员意见，民盟、九三学社、民革等组织还派出干部到机关、医院、企业及成员家里，利用小型座谈会或个别访问等形式，征求成员平日所感觉到的问题和意见。
    在检查统一战线工作开展较早的机关、学校、企业中，各民主党派的基层组织已经收集了不少有关统一战线工作的意见和建议。各民主党派的重庆市各级组织已把收集到的各种意见和建议交给了中共重庆市各级党组织，帮助他们改进工作。
    中共重庆市各级党组织全面检查统一战线的工作是在2月中旬开始的，目前大多数机关、学校、企业都正在检查本单位党员和党外人士的合作共事关系，部分单位已检查完毕。在2月下旬各民主党派和人民团体举行的“双周座谈会”上，中共重庆市委统战部负责人曾同到会人士谈了全市开展检查统战工作的情况，表示欢迎各民主党派在各单位的组织积极协助所在单位的中共党组织做好这一工作的检查。
