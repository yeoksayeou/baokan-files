    Creating Conditions for "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom," "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend"
    Literary and art workers must redouble their efforts to grasp ideological remolding and more actively embody the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers in their creative practice; they must promote life and inspire people to move forward.

　　Joint Statement by Xiong Foxi, Cao Ming, Tang Tao, Ke Ling, Zhang Junxiang, Du Pengcheng, and Na. Sayinchaoketu
    We are literary and art workers. We were honored to hear Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Council on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and we were deeply educated. Here are a few shallow thoughts on the issue of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," for the criticism and correction of all committee members.
    Marxism teaches us that everything must develop through struggle, and art and science are no exception. Since the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," although it has not been long, it should be said that a new atmosphere has begun to appear in the literary and art field: many writers who have been idle for a long time have picked up their pens again to create happily, many talented young people are like "new orioles testing their wings," singing the first song when spring arrives, and many ancient traditional programs have been excavated. The ranks of literature and art have begun to expand, the themes of works have gradually become broad, and the forms of art have gradually become diverse. All of this shows a promising literary and artistic future that is becoming increasingly prosperous. However, on the road to prosperity, there are difficulties and obstacles. Some comrades, seeing the "blooming" and hearing the "contending," become nervous, fearing that things will go wrong; some comrades are accustomed to small worlds, hearing the sound of contending and seeing the colorful blooming, feel confused; especially when they see that some works have shortcomings and deviations, and some arguments are unhealthy, they say that poisonous weeds have grown in the literary garden, and the artistic world is disturbed by miscellaneous noises, and therefore want to use simplistic criticism to solve the problem. However, although they are doing it with the good intention of defending the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers and defending socialist realism, the result is contrary to their wishes, because dogmatic criticism or repressive methods cannot convince people. In short, these comrades hope that fragrant flowers will bloom without cultivation and irrigation, and that strong rice will grow without cultivation. They think that they can achieve socialism smoothly and quietly, and produce great socialist realistic works.
    These ideas are of course naive, and it can be said that they are naive to a terrible degree. However, in the literary and art circles, a large part of people—including the few of us—have more or less touched on this kind of thinking, or at least have held an approving or acquiescent attitude towards criticisms that reveal this kind of thinking.
    It can be said with certainty that this kind of thinking and this kind of criticism neither believes in the discerning ability of the masses nor doubts the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend." It goes without saying that it is not conducive to the implementation of the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend."
    Indeed, in the past year, along with fragrant flowers and elegant songs, some weeds and idle flowers have indeed grown in the literary and artistic garden, and some noises and miscellaneous sounds have been spread. For example, there are some new sentimental and romantic contents in literary works, some monsters and demons have appeared in the repertoire, and what is even more regrettable is that some comrades who have relatively rich experience in life and struggle and have written exciting works have also lost their way and started writing meaningless vulgar works. Some people want to obliterate the achievements of literature and art since the "Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," some people say that the films after liberation are worthless, and some people think that the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers is a direction of formalism and conceptualization. We cannot but pay attention to these phenomena, and we cannot but oppose these arguments.
    However, we must admit that the ideas behind these phenomena and arguments did not arise today. China is a country with a large number of petty bourgeoisie, and the thoughts, feelings, and tastes of the petty bourgeoisie will inevitably be reflected in the literary and art field. Therefore, what is strange is not these phenomena and arguments themselves, but that we have ignored the objective reality that produces these phenomena and forgotten that since different ideological consciousnesses exist, the artistic achievements must exist in conjunction with different ideological consciousnesses.
    We must face this objective reality squarely, maintain a clear head and sharp judgment, and at the same time, more importantly, we must neither be alarmed nor panic. We must understand that these ideological consciousnesses and the works that embody these ideological consciousnesses can never be frightened away by dogmatic criticism. Dogmatic criticism will only help these things. Only by adhering to the truth, only by conducting detailed research on specific works and literary trends, and through well-intentioned criticism, reasoned persuasion, and debate, will correct opinions become clear. We must be good at analyzing, good at distinguishing; discarding some and absorbing some. When dealing with works of art, as long as there is something that can be affirmed, it should be affirmed. For errors and shortcomings, there should also be convincing analysis and criticism, so as to move people with sincerity and convince people with reason. Only in this way can the process of criticism be a process of education and pursuit of truth; can the negative factors be turned into positive factors.
    To achieve this, the prerequisite is "blooming" and "contending." Without "blooming" there is no comparison, and without "contending" it is impossible to reach consensus.
    Most of the people engaged in literary and artistic creation come from the petty bourgeoisie or the bourgeoisie. Although each of us has received varying degrees of life education, class struggle education, and Marxist education, this transformation is far from enough. In our creative practice, we often have this shortcoming or that error. Therefore, under the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom," we cannot relax, but must redouble our efforts to grasp ideological remolding; not to leave the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers, but to more actively embody this direction in our creative practice. The purpose of literature and art is not only to reflect the reality of life, but also to promote life and inspire people to move forward. As literary and art workers, we can only shoulder our sacred task if we work together to transform our thinking and improve our ability to understand. If the flowers we are blooming now are not fragrant, we must strive to make them fragrant; if they are not fragrant enough now, we must strive to make them more fragrant. No matter how different our opinions are on specific issues, our goal of socialism is always the same. This common goal creates conditions for our "blooming" and "contending" and opens up a very broad world. Let us, under the leadership of the Party, and under the correct policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," work together to move forward.

### 为“百花齐放”、“百家争鸣”创造条件

    为“百花齐放”、“百家争鸣”创造条件
    文艺工作者要加倍地抓紧思想改造，更积极地在创作实践中体现工农兵方向；要推动生活，鼓舞人们前进。
　　熊佛西、草明、唐弢、柯灵、张骏祥、杜鹏程、纳·赛音朝克图的联合发言
    我们是文艺工作者。这次很荣幸地听了毛主席在最高国务会议上关于“正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话，受到了深刻的教育。兹就“百花齐放百家争鸣”问题，谈几点粗浅的感想，请各位委员批评指正。
    马克思主义教导我们，任何事物都必须从斗争中求得发展，艺术科学也不例外。自从党中央提出“百花齐放百家争鸣”的方针以后，虽然为时不久，文艺领域内应该说是开始出现了新的气象：许多搁笔已久的作家重新提笔欣然创作，许多有才华的青年正如“雏莺新试”，唱出了春天到来时的第一曲，许多古老的传统节目被挖掘了出来。文艺的队伍开始扩大，作品的题材逐渐广泛，艺术的形式也逐步地走向多样。这一切都显示着一个日见繁荣的文艺前途。不过，在通向繁荣境界的道路上，有困难，有阻力。有一些同志，看到了“放”、听到了“鸣”，就紧张起来，害怕出乱子，有的同志习惯于小天地，听到争鸣之声，看到齐放的缤纷，感到困惑；尤其是看到一些作品有缺点和偏差，一些论调不健康，便说文学园地里长出毒草了，艺术天地给杂响“鸣”乱了，因而想用简单化的批评解决问题。但是，尽管他们是出于一片保卫工农兵方向保卫社会主义现实主义的好心，结果却是事与愿违，因教条主义的批评，或压制的办法，都不能服人。总之，这些同志是希望不栽培灌溉就开出香花，不从事耕耘就能长出壮茁的稻谷。他们以为会平平稳稳地、安安静静地达到社会主义，产生伟大的社会主义现实主义的作品。
    这些想法当然是天真的，可以说天真到了可怕的程度。但是在文艺界中，有很大一部分人——当然包括我们几个人在内——都或多或少地沾着点儿这种想法，至少是对于流露这种想法的批评或多或少地抱了称许的或是默认的态度。
    可以肯定地说：这种想法，这种批评是既不相信群众的鉴别能力，对“百花齐放百家争鸣”的方针也有怀疑。其不利于“百花齐放百家争鸣”方针的贯彻，是不待言的事。
    不错，一年来，随着香花和雅歌，文艺园地里也的确生长出了一些野草闲花，传播了一些噪音杂响。譬如：文学作品里有了一些新的风花雪月，剧目里出现了一些牛鬼蛇神，更可惋惜的是有些比较有丰富生活斗争经验并且写过激动人心的作品的同志，也迷失方向，写起毫无意义的庸俗作品来。有人想抹煞“延安文艺座谈会”以后的文艺成就，有人把解放后的电影说成一无是处，也有人认为工农兵方向就是公式主义概念化的方向，这些现象我们不能不注意，这些论调我们不能不反对。
    但是，我们必须承认，这些现象和论调背后的思想，并不是今天才产生的。中国是一个小资产阶级众多的国家，小资产阶级的思想感情和趣味，必然地会在文艺领域内得到反映。所以，值得奇怪的倒不是这些现象和论调的本身，而是我们竟然忽视了产生这个现象的客观的现实，忘记了不同的思想意识既然存在着，艺术的成果就必然和不同的思想意识相胶结地存在着。
    我们必须正视这种客观现实，保持清醒的头脑和锐敏的判断力，同时，更重要的，是既不必大惊小怪，必须了解这些思想意识和体现这些思想意识的作品绝不是教条主义的批评所能吓退的。教条主义的批评只会助长这些东西。我们只有坚持真理，只有对具体作品和文艺倾向进行细致的研究，通过善意的批评，有理的说服和争辩，正确的意见才会显明起来。要善于分析，善于辨别；有所抛弃，有所吸收。对待艺术作品，只要有一点可以肯定的，就应该加以肯定，对于错误和缺点，也需要有令人首肯的分析和批判，做到以诚感人，以理服人。只有这样，批评的过程才能是教育和追求真理的过程；才能使消极的因素变为积极的因素。
    要做到这一点，先决条件就是“齐放”与“争鸣”。不“齐放”就没有比较，不“争鸣”就达不到一致。
    从事文学艺术创作的人绝大部分出身于小资产阶级，或资产阶级。虽然我们每个人都受过程度不同的生活教育、阶级斗争教育和马克思主义的教育，但是，这个改造是远远不够的。我们在创作实践中经常不是出现这种缺点，就是出现那种错误。因此，在“百花齐放”的方针之下，我们 不是可以放松，而是必须加倍地抓紧思想改造；不是离开工农兵方向，而是更积极地在创作实践中体现这个方向。文学艺术的目的，不仅仅是反映现实的生活，而要推动生活，鼓舞人们前进。作为文艺工作者，我们只有共同努力改造思想、提高自己的认识能力，以期能把我们的神圣的任务肩负起来。如果我们现在开的花不香，就要争取它开得香；如果现在开的不够香，就要争取它开得更香。不管大家在具体问题上有怎样不同的意见，我们为社会主义的目标总是一致的。这个一致的目标就为我们的“齐放”和“争鸣”创造了条件，展开了非常广阔的天地。让我们在党的领导下，在“百花齐放百家争鸣”的正确方针下，一齐努力前进吧。
