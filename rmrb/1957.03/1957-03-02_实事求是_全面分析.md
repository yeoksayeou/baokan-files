    Seek Truth From Facts, Analyze Comprehensively
    Currently, the campaign for increasing production and practicing economy in some factories and mines is not progressing well. Besides some objective reasons, the main reason is that some cadres have negative and conservative sentiments. When formulating plans, they disregard the actual situation, blindly lower targets and quotas, and try their best to increase various "insurance coefficients"; or they overestimate difficulties and hesitate, and the plans are delayed.
    The emergence of this negative sentiment shows that some comrades lack a correct and comprehensive understanding of the "sufficiently reliable" policy. "Sufficiently reliable" requires our plans to conform to objective and practical possibilities, and can be realized through subjective efforts and practice. Therefore, the objective possibilities mentioned here include the conditions that can be obtained through subjective efforts. The situation in economic work is complex, intricate, and constantly changing. If we can strengthen investigation and research, and strengthen subjective efforts, then there is no doubt that many difficulties can be overcome through subjective efforts. Abandoning subjective efforts obviously does not conform to the "sufficiently reliable" policy.
    All factories and mines have checked and summarized their work last year. However, many units did not conduct in-depth and specific analysis and research on the actual situation at that time, and did not correctly summarize the experiences and lessons learned from it. Instead, they simply made the conclusion that "last year was rash, and it was wrong," and believed that "last year, mobilizing the masses was rash, and this year we have to retreat." This is also another important reason for their current negative attitude of retreating and not advancing in formulating production increase and economy plans and mobilizing the masses. We must make a comprehensive assessment of the work last year. We must make specific analysis and summaries of last year's experience, and should not attribute it to "mobilizing the masses was wrong." Mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses is the fundamental method for our Party to carry out all its work. And years of experience have proved that for the industrial front, where tasks are particularly arduous and complex, not only can there be no "exceptions," but on the contrary, it is even more necessary to conscientiously and thoroughly implement the mass line. Therefore, all factories and mines should bring the production and production increase plan targets to the masses to listen to their opinions. The difficulties existing in production should also be told to the masses, and everyone should be mobilized to find ways to overcome them. Fully relying on the masses is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in increasing production and practicing economy.
    In the minds of many comrades, there is a great deal of subjective one-sidedness, so they have varying degrees of blindness in their thinking and work. When the wind of opposing conservatism is strong, they think that the larger the plan, the less conservative it is, and they blindly set the plan too large, resulting in the mistake of rash advance. Now that the rash advance has been checked, conservative sentiments have grown again, wavering and indecisive, or in very complex and difficult situations, they cannot maintain a clear head, but only sigh and do not muster the courage to strive forward. Here, once again, a serious problem is raised to us, that is: in order to enable the Party's policies to be correctly implemented and the Party's work to develop smoothly, we must overcome the subjectivism in the ideological understanding of cadres, especially leaders.

### 实事求是  全面分析

    实事求是  全面分析
    目前，有些厂矿的增产节约运动开展得不好，这除了有一些客观原因以外，主要是有些干部有消极保守情绪。他们在制订计划时，不顾实际情况，盲目压低指标和定额，尽力加大各种“保险系数”；或者过高估计困难，犹豫不决，计划迟迟定不下来。
    这种消极情绪的产生，说明有些同志对“充分可靠”的方针，缺乏正确的、全面的认识。“充分可靠”，是要求我们的计划符合客观的实际可能，经过主观努力、经过实践就可以变为现实；因此，这里所说的客观可能，是包括主观努力所能争取到的条件在内的。经济工作中的情况是错综复杂、发展变化的，如果我们能加强调查研究，加强主观努力，那末毫无疑问，有许多困难经过主观努力是可以克服的，放弃了主观努力，显然不符合“充分可靠”的方针。
    各厂矿企业都检查总结了去年的工作。但是不少单位没有深入具体地分析研究当时的实际情况，从中正确地总结出经验教训，而是简单化地作了“去年冒了，错了”的结论，并且认为“去年就是发动群众闹冒了，今年可得退一退”。这也是他们当前对制订增产节约计划和发动群众采取退缩不前的消极态度的另一个重要原因。对去年的工作，必须作全面的估计。对去年的经验，必须作具体的分析、总结，而不应该归之于“发动群众错了”。发动群众、依靠群众，这是我们党进行一切工作的根本方法。而几年来的经验更证明，对任务特别艰巨复杂的工业战线来说，不仅不能“例外”，相反的更加需要认真彻底贯彻执行群众路线。因此，各厂矿企业，都应该把生产和增产计划指标拿到群众中去，听取群众的意见。对生产中存在的困难，也应该告诉群众，动员大家想办法去克服。充分依靠群众，是做好增产节约工作的根本保证。
    在许多同志的思想上有着很大的主观片面性，因此他们在思想上和工作上就有不同程度的盲目性，反保守的风大了，就以为计划越大越不保守，便盲目地把计划订的过大，结果又犯了冒进的错误，现在检查了冒进，就又滋长保守情绪，摇摆不定，或者在十分复杂和困难的情况下，不能保持清醒的头脑，只是唉声叹气，而不鼓起勇气奋勉前进。这里再一次向我们提出了一个值得严重注意的问题，这就是：要使党的方针政策能够得到正确的贯彻执行，党的工作得以顺利发展，就必须克服干部、特别是领导人员思想认识上的主观主义。 （摘自辽宁日报）
