    Chinese Friends, Let Us Join Hands to Defend Peace

    (I) Chinese Friends:

    Our good friend, Sasaki Sadako, was an athletic star, better than anyone at all kinds of sports, and very warm to people. But she often went to the U.S. Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission. Why did the robust Sasaki often go there? This was something we couldn't understand. Unfortunately, she suddenly died of atomic disease last year. We never imagined that our dear friend would become a victim of the atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb!

    Sadako's death grieves us and will be unforgettable for the rest of our lives. What can we do for the deceased? We think there is only one thing: resolutely defend peace! We are determined to build a "Children's Statue Under the Atomic Bomb" to awaken people to fight for the defense of peace.

    Friends: Let us join hands to prevent atomic war and defend world peace!
                                                                                        Sasaki Sadako's Friends

                            (II) Chinese Young Friends:

    I really want to correspond with you, and I am now learning Chinese. I am writing this letter to you with the sincere hope of strengthening the friendship between our two peoples, uniting them like brothers, and fighting to prevent war and defend peace.

    I am now a 22-year-old youth, studying at Northeast College. After graduating this March, I hope to go to a middle school as a teacher. I subscribe to the "People's China" magazine. I am very interested in the lives of the Chinese people and want to know about your studies and work. You have many things worth learning from. Finally, I wish you progress and good health.

                          (III) Chinese Young Friends:

    Our country, Japan, is the first country in the world to suffer from atomic bomb disasters. Therefore, we deeply feel that there is nothing more important in the world than peace and friendship. For the happiness of mankind, we are willing to join hands with friends all over the world to fight for the defense of peace.

    In your country, there are many things worth learning from us. We young people, with the spirit of "exploring knowledge in the vast world," are very happy to make friends with Chinese children, correspond with each other, and exchange knowledge. We are waiting for your replies.

    日本来信
    中日人民携手保卫和平
    （一）中国的朋友们：
    我们的好朋友佐佐木祯子，是一个运动健将，各项体育活动比谁都强，而且对人非常亲热。可是，她常常到美国原子弹受害者调查机关去。为什么健壮的佐佐木常到那里去呢？这是我们不能理解的。不幸得很，去年她突然因患原子病而死去了。我们怎么也没想到，我们的亲爱的朋友作了原子弹、氢弹的牺牲者！
    佐佐木的死使我们悲痛，使我们一生难忘。我们能对死者作些什么呢？我们想只有一个，就是坚决保卫和平！我们决心建成“原子弹下的儿童之像”，以唤起人们为保卫和平而斗争。
    朋友们：让我们携起手来，为防止原子战争、保卫世界和平而奋斗吧！　佐佐木祯子的朋友
                            （二）中国青年朋友们：
    我非常想与你们通信，现在我正在学习中文。我写这封信给你们是真诚地希望加强我们两国人民之间的友谊，使之团结像兄弟一样，为防止战争、保卫和平而斗争。
    我现在是二十二岁的青年，在东北学院学习。今年3月毕业后，我希望去中学当教员。我订了“人民中国”杂志。我对中国人民的生活很感兴趣，想知道你们的学习和工作情况。你们有很多东西是值得我学习的。最后，祝你们进步和身体健康。

                          （三）中国少年朋友们：
    我们的祖国日本，是世界上第一个遭受原子弹灾害的国家。所以，我们深深地感到：在世界上没有比和平和友谊更重要的东西了。为了人类的幸福，我们愿意和世界上的朋友们携起手来，为保卫和平而奋斗。
    在你们的国家，有许多值得我们学习的东西。年轻的我们抱着“在广大世界探索知识”的精神，非常高兴和中国少年们交朋友，互相通信，交流知识。等待着你们的回信。　日本静冈县静冈市葵町五九
