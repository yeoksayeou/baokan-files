    Announcing Long-Distance Calls
    Can Save Call Time and Improve Call Efficiency
    (Our dispatch) The Wuhan Long-Distance Telephone Bureau began offering "announced long-distance call" service on March 1 of this year.
    This type of call involves conveying the main content of the call (stipulated to be no more than ten characters) to the called party through the long-distance operator when registering the call, either three hours before the intended call time or the day before. After receiving the notification, the called party can make preparations in advance and talk at the agreed-upon time.
    In this way, both the caller and the called party can control and save call time, improving call efficiency, and enabling balanced use of long-distance telephone circuits. Users without a telephone can also register for an announced paging call and go to the business office to talk at the agreed-upon time.
    The Wuhan Long-Distance Telephone Bureau has temporarily designated eighteen locations for opening "announced long-distance call" service. Outside the province, the service is available from Hankou to ten locations including Beijing, Zhengzhou, Nanjing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Nanchang, Changsha, Xinyang, Jiujiang, and Guangzhou. Within the province, the service is available from Hankou to eight locations including Huangshi, Shashi, Xiaogan, Huanggang, Echeng, Yichang, Fancheng, and Jiangling. In the future, preparations will be made to gradually increase the number of calling locations to meet the needs of the broad masses of the people.

    预告长途电话
    可以节约通话时间提高通话效率
    本报讯　武汉市长途报话局从本年3月1日起开办了“预告长途电话”业务。
    这种电话是在准备通话时间的三小时以前或前一天，把通话主要内容（规定不超过十个字），在挂号的时候，委托长途台传达给受话人。受话人在得到通知后，事前作好准备，在约定的时间内通话。
    这样，发话人和受话人都可以掌握和节约通话时间，提高了通话效率；并使长途电话电路可以得到平衡使用。没有装电话的用户，也可以挂预告传呼电话，约定时间到营业处通话。
    武汉市长途报话局开放“预告长途电话”的地点暂时定为十八处。省外的开放汉口到北京、郑州、南京、上海、重庆、南昌、长沙、信阳、九江、广州等十处。省内的开放汉口到黄石、沙市、孝感、黄冈、鄂城、宜昌、樊城、江陵等八处。将来准备逐步增加通话地点，以满足广大人民群众的需要。
