Three Female Directors of Agricultural Cooperatives
By our reporter Li Jianhong

    During the National Congress of Agricultural Labor Models, I interviewed three rural women who attended the meeting. One was an old woman with a face full of wrinkles, wrinkles that recorded her nearly twenty years of arduous struggle; one was a mother holding a baby, mild in temperament but with an iron will; one was a simple, middle-aged woman who demonstrated outstanding talent in leading the agricultural cooperative movement. They are all directors of agricultural cooperatives, and they all have admirable model deeds.

              Zhu Wenhua, Who Insists on Democratic Cooperative Management
    The middle-aged farmer is named Zhu Wenhua, director of the "May Second" Agricultural Cooperative in Yangqu County, Shanxi Province. She is thirty-two years old this year and has not had much schooling, but she is very calm and handles the many complex problems of a large cooperative with six hundred and fourteen households in an orderly manner, to everyone's satisfaction.

    When this advanced cooperative was first established, it was also relatively chaotic. No matter how big or small the matter, it was always "the members looking for the team leader, and the team leader looking for the director." As a result, problems piled up, neither gaining the support of the members nor allowing communication between higher and lower levels. In order to reverse this situation, she proposed a method of democratic cooperative management at the management committee meeting. At the time, everyone was against it. They said, "A family of a thousand is managed by one person; if everyone is in charge, nothing will be accomplished." However, she was not deterred. She insisted on her opinion and persuaded everyone with the practical experience of using the members' representative meeting when running the primary cooperative.

    After the management committee unified its thinking, it convened the first members' representative meeting. Because the purpose was not clear, the management committee submitted the pre-drafted cooperative charter and production plan to the members' representative meeting for discussion all at once. As a result, nothing was resolved.

    She was not discouraged by this. She and the members of the management committee summed up the lessons learned from this meeting, and then convened the second members' representative meeting. This time, serious preparations and arrangements were made in the first half month, and the management committee also dispatched six cadres to report and explain the content of the meeting to the members of each team. On the one hand, they widely publicized the rights and obligations of the members' representatives. On the other hand, on behalf of the management committee, they deeply reviewed the shortcomings of not being democratic or thorough enough in the past, as well as the failure to fully promote democracy at the first members' representative meeting. This greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the members and representatives, and everyone put forward many criticisms and rationalization proposals for improving the work. This conference not only improved the leadership of the management committee and strengthened labor management, but also greatly encouraged the members and cooperative cadres' confidence in democratic cooperative management. Since then, whenever major issues concerning the members were encountered, both higher and lower levels actively requested that this democratic method be used to solve them. Over the past year, they have held seven members' representative meetings, each of which has promoted the development of this cooperative. Last year, the cooperative achieved an all-round bumper harvest of agriculture and sideline occupations, with grain production increasing by more than 30% and sideline production increasing thirteen times. Each labor day earned one yuan and forty cents.

            Luo Xiuying is Tempered into Steel Through Struggle
    The old woman Luo Xiuying is the director of the Xinghua Cooperative in Cang County, Hebei Province, and is a time-tested model. When I entered her room, a young soldier was talking to her affectionately. I thought he was also there to interview her, but after being introduced, I learned that he was her son visiting her. Just as we were talking, she was called away to take a group photo.

    After she left, the young soldier enthusiastically told me about his mother's many model deeds. He said: His mother joined the Party in 1938. For nearly twenty years, she has always stood at the forefront in various revolutionary works. He talked about the situation during the War of Resistance Against Japan: At that time, his father had died, and his mother was dragging her three very young siblings, not only having to rely on her own hard work to maintain the family's life, but also having to carry out various arduous struggles with the enemy. In dangerous situations, she had sheltered revolutionary comrades and had also sent intelligence to our army. For this reason, she was often chased by the enemy and had to hide here and there. Once, she drilled into a tunnel and was almost suffocated to death by the enemy's poisonous gas. Even in this difficult and dangerous situation, her will to fight against the enemy did not waver in the slightest, and she continued to struggle until the final liberation.

    Then he introduced some of his mother's outstanding performances on the production front. As early as 1950, during the launch of the Great Production Movement, she used her many years of rich production experience to create a record of producing 500 jin of seed cotton per mu on three mu of land, and summarized a set of advanced technologies according to the cotton planting sequence. Subsequently, in the mutual aid group and the cooperative, she cultivated high-yield fields of millet and corn. She not only has rich production experience, but also has a clear mass viewpoint and a high degree of class consciousness. Her spirit of selflessness and dedication is very admirable. Whenever there were floods or lean times, she was so worried that she couldn't sleep day and night. She felt worse seeing the members hungry than being hungry herself. Over the years, she has taken out more than 600 jin of relief grain from her own pocket, and she has also used the money sent back by her son from the army to help people. Her own life is very hard, and she fills her stomach with bean cake when there is not enough grain to eat.

    While we were talking, she came back. She then talked to me about the disaster situation in the cooperative last year and the current production self-rescue problems in the cooperative. Although she is nearly fifty years old, her memory is still very good. She told me that the whole cooperative has organized eighteen kinds of sideline production. At the beginning, the male members all had work to do, but the women were still idle. After signing a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative to sew soles, the young and nimble women all found work, but the old and technically unskilled women still had no work to do. In order to solve the problem of these women working and improve the quality and speed of sewing soles, auxiliary sewing groups and temporary childcare groups were also organized. Now, all male and female members of the cooperative are participating in sideline production, with a total daily income of 535 yuan. She said confidently: The leadership from higher levels this year is really good, there is no need to worry about getting through the spring famine, and spring plowing production will definitely not be affected. If there are no major disasters this year, production will definitely increase; even if there are major disasters, we will never suffer such a great loss as last year.

              Chen Shuzhen Runs the Cooperative with More and More Enthusiasm
    The mother holding a baby is named Chen Shuzhen, the deputy director of the "March 8th" Agricultural Cooperative in Su County, Anhui Province. In order to attend this labor model representative meeting, she came to Beijing with her three-month-old baby, regardless of the cold weather and the long journey.

    When I asked why their cooperative was named the "March 8th" Cooperative, she suddenly talked to me with a hundred times more energy. She said: It's a long story. Originally, the women in our area generally did not have the habit of going to the fields to work. Only I had been working in the fields with my father since I was a child, so I can do everything in the fields. When the mutual aid group was first organized, I joined. The whole village was gradually organized, except for eight military families and widows, whom no mutual aid group wanted. I was very angry when I saw this situation, and I quit the original mutual aid group in a fit of anger and formed another mutual aid group with these women.

    While breastfeeding her child, she continued to say to me meaningfully: When we first organized, we encountered great difficulties in production, not only with less labor (the whole group had only eight strong women and four old and weak women), but even fewer livestock and farm tools. The whole group only had one donkey. As a last resort, everyone pooled money and bought another cow. Despite these difficulties, everyone still gritted their teeth and persevered. We had a common idea: "Even if we don't steam steamed buns, we still have to fight for breath!" It will only count if we do better than those mutual aid groups. Therefore, every woman can endure hardship. When plowing, there were not enough livestock, so everyone competed to pull the plow. During the summer harvest, the women cut wheat all day, and their waists were so sore that they could not stand up straight. After a short rest, they carried the cut wheat back one trip after another. Some women's shoulders were red, swollen, and bleeding, but they didn't utter a word of pain in front of people from other groups; after going to bed at night, their bodies were so sore that they couldn't fall asleep for most of the night. They worked like this for two years, and production increased significantly every year. In 1953, the mutual aid group was transformed into a primary cooperative. The situation at this time was much better than before. The cooperative had two cows and two donkeys, and the women's labor skills had improved. The first year of running the cooperative saw an unprecedented increase in production, with a yield per mu twelve jin and twelve liang higher than other cooperatives, and one mu of wheat yielding two hundred and fifty or sixty jin. After the autumn harvest, the cooperative expanded to seventy households. Everyone worked harder and harder, and the cooperative expanded year after year, gradually becoming the best of the twelve primary cooperatives in the township. When merging cooperatives and upgrading, this cooperative was the main one and merged into a large cooperative with one thousand and one households. Because this cooperative was initially established by women, everyone named it the "March 8th" Cooperative to commemorate this event.

    Finally, she said: Even now, the women of this cooperative are still taking the lead in everything. 70% of the women have learned new technologies such as mixing seeds, soaking seeds, artificial pollination, and using double-铧 plows.

                                                          ＊
    Although I only made a superficial visit and short contact with them, the impression they gave me will never be forgotten. Even now, every time I think of their enthusiasm for the people, their courage to forge ahead on the revolutionary road, and the intelligence and talent they have shown in various works, I cannot help but feel proud that the country has such outstanding daughters, and honored that women have such talents.

    三个农业社的女主任
    本报记者　李剑虹
    在全国农业劳动模范代表会议期间，我访问了出席会议的三位农村妇女。一位是满面皱纹的老大娘，那皱纹记载着她经历了将近二十年的艰苦斗争；一位是抱着婴儿的母亲，他性情温和但具有钢铁般的意志；一位是朴实的壮年妇女，她在领导农业合作运动中表现了突出的才能。她们都是农业社的主任，她们都有令人钦佩的模范事迹。
              坚持民主办社的朱文华
    那位壮年农妇名叫朱文华，是山西省阳曲县“五二”农业社主任。她今年三十二岁，没有念过多少书，但是面对着六百一十四户的大社的许多复杂问题，却表现得很沉着，处理得井井有条，人人满意。
    这个高级社初建成的时候，也比较混乱，无论大小事，都是“社员找队长，队长找主任”。结果，问题堆成了堆，既得不到社员支持，又弄得上下不通气。为了扭转这种状况，她在管委会上提出了民主办社的办法。当时，大家都很反对。他们说：“家有千口，主事一人；大家都当家，一事无成。”但是，她没有被碰回去，她坚持自己的意见，并以办初级社的时候运用社员代表会议的实际经验说服了大家。
    管委会统一思想以后，就召开了第一次社员代表大会。由于目的性不明确，管委会将事前拟定的社章、生产计划一下子都提交社员代表大会讨论。结果，什么问题也没有解决。
    她并没有为此灰心。她同管委会的委员们总结了这次会议的教训，接着又召开了第二次社员代表大会。这次会议在前半个月内就作了认真的准备和布置，管委会还抽出六个干部分赴各队给社员报告和讲解会议内容。他们一方面广泛宣传社员代表的权利和义务，一方面代表管委会向社员深刻地检讨了过去不民主不深入，以及第一次社员代表大会没有充分发扬民主的缺点。这样，大大启发了社员和代表们的积极性，大家提出了不少批评和改进工作的合理化建议。这次大会不仅改进了管委会的领导，加强了劳动管理工作，并且大大鼓舞了社员和社干部民主办社的信心。以后，每遇到有关社员群众的重大问题，上下都主动地要求采用这种民主方式解决。一年来他们共开过七次社员代表大会，每一次大会都促使这个合作社向前发展了一步。去年这个社农副业全面大丰收，粮食增产30％多，副业增产了十三倍，每个劳动日分得了一元四角。
            罗秀英在斗争中百炼成钢
    老大娘罗秀英是河北省沧县兴华社的主任，是一个百炼成钢的老模范。当我走进她住的房间的时候，一位青年军人正在和她亲热地交谈。我以为这也是访问她的人，经过介绍，才知道是她的儿子来看她。我们正谈着的时候，她又被人找去照团体像去了。
    她走后，青年军人向我热情地谈了他妈妈的许多模范事迹。他说：他的母亲1938年就入党了，近二十年来，在各种革命工作中都是站在最前面的。他谈到了抗日战争中的情形：那时，他的父亲死去了，母亲拖带着他们年纪很小的兄妹三人，不仅要靠自己艰苦的劳动维持全家的生活，而且还要和敌人进行种种艰苦的斗争。她在危险的情况下，曾掩护过革命同志，也曾为我军送过情报，为此常常被敌人追得东藏西躲。有一次她钻到地道里，几乎被敌人的毒瓦斯熏死。就是这样艰难、危险，也没有使她对敌斗争的意志发生一点动摇，一直斗争到最后解放。
    接着又介绍了他母亲在生产战线上的一些突出表现。早在1950年开展大生产运动中，她以多年来丰富的生产经验，在三亩地上亲手创造了亩产五百斤籽棉的纪录，并按植棉顺序总结出来了一套先进的技术。接着，在互助组和合作社里，又培育了谷子、玉米的高额丰产田。她不仅有丰富的生产经验，并且有明确的群众观点和高度的阶级觉悟。她那种大公无私和克己奉公的精神很使人钦佩。每遇到水灾和青黄不接的时候，愁得她白天晚上放心不下，她看到社员受饿比自己受饿还难受。几年来仅她自己就拿出了六百多斤的救济粮，儿子从部队寄回的钱她也都救济了人。她自己的生活却很刻苦，粮食不够吃了就以豆饼充饥。
    我们正谈间，她又回来了。她接着又向我谈了去年社内受灾情况和当前社里的生产自救问题。她虽然已近五十岁，但是记忆力还很好。她告诉我，全社已组织起了十八种副业生产。开始的时候男社员都有活干了，妇女们还都闲着，和供销社订了纳鞋底的合同后，年青利落的妇女才都找到了活，可是年老和技术不好的妇女仍然没活干。为了解决这部分妇女干活的问题和提高纳底的质量和速度，又组织了辅助性的缝衣小组和临时托儿小组。现在，全社男女社员都参加到副业生产中了，总计每天的收入有五百三十五元。她满有信心地说：今年上级领导的真好，不用愁春荒难度，春耕生产也绝不会受影响。今年如果不遇大灾害，一定能增产；就是遇到大灾害，也绝不会再受到去年那样大的损失。
              陈淑贞办社越办越有劲
    抱着婴儿的母亲名叫陈淑贞，是安徽省宿县“三八”农业社的副主任。她为了参加这次劳动模范代表会议，不顾风寒、路远，带着三个月的婴儿来到了北京。
    当我问起他们的社为什么命名为“三八”社的时候，她骤然精神百倍地向我谈了起来。她说：说起来话长。原来我们那里的妇女一般都没有下田做活的习惯，只有我从小就跟着父亲下地干活，所以地里的活样样都会做。在刚组织互助组的时候，我便参加了。全村渐渐都组织起来了，只有八户军属和寡妇，哪个互助组也不要她们。我看到这种情况很气愤，一赌气退出了原来的互助组，和这几户妇女另组成一个互助组。
    她一面给孩子吃奶，一面意味深长地继续向我说：我们才组织起来的时候，在生产上遇到了很大的困难，不仅劳力少（全组只有八个壮年妇女、四个老弱妇女），牲口农具更少，全组只有一个驴。不得已，大家摊钱又买了一条牛。虽然有这些困难，大家仍然硬着头皮往下干。我们有一个共同的想法：“不蒸馒头也要蒸（争）口气！”一定要比他们那些互助组干得好才算话。因此，每个妇女都很能吃苦。耕种的时候牲口不够用，大家都争着拉犁。夏收当中，妇女们割一整天麦子，腰都酸痛得直不起来了，稍微休息一下，接着又一趟一趟地把割倒的麦子都背回去。有些妇女的肩膀都红肿流血了，当着别组的人也不叫一声痛；晚上睡下后，浑身酸痛得大半天不能入睡。就这样干了两年，年年都显著地增产了。1953年互助组转成了初级社，这时候的情况比以前好多了，社里有两头牛和两个驴了，妇女的劳动技术都提高了。办社头一年就空前增产，每亩产量比其他社高出了十二斤十二两，一亩麦子就打二百五、六十斤。秋收后，社又扩大到了七十户。大家越干越有劲，这个社年年都在扩大，渐渐成了全乡十二个初级社中最好的一个。并社升级的时候，以这个合作社为主合并成了一千零一户的大社。因为这个社当初是由妇女们兴办起来的，大家为了纪念这件事，便把它命名为“三八”社。
    最后她又说：直到现在，这个社的妇女们仍是处处当先，有70％的妇女都学会了拌种、浸种、人工授粉和使用双铧犁等新技术。
                                                          ＊
    对她们虽然仅仅作了粗浅的访问和短短的接触，但是给我的印象却是永远不会忘记的。直到现在，每想起她们那种对人民的热情，在革命道路上猛进的勇气，在各种工作中所表现出来的聪明才智，我就不禁为国家有这样的优秀女儿而感到骄傲，为妇女中有这样的人材而感到光荣。
