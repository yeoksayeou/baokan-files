Xinhua News Agency, Bonn: West German Chancellor Adenauer replied on February 22 to a letter from Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin regarding relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. The West German government published Adenauer's reply on February 28.

In his reply, Adenauer defended the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He denied that West Germany was being pushed by this group onto the path of aggression and demanded that the Soviet Union accept the "fait accompli" of West Germany's membership in this group.

Adenauer did not recognize the existence of the German Democratic Republic. He stated that there could be no question of "two Germanys" and reiterated the proposal for so-called "free elections."

Regarding the issue of disarmament, Adenauer said that disarmament could only be discussed "fruitfully" after "overcoming the roots of existing tensions in the political sphere" and implementing "effective supervision" of nuclear weapons.

At the same time, Adenauer expressed agreement with Bulganin's proposal to develop trade relations between the two countries to improve the political climate. He also suggested that the two governments hold negotiations on this issue in the near future. Adenauer also cited figures to illustrate the substantial growth in trade volume between the Soviet Union and West Germany since 1954.

Adenauer also expressed agreement with Bulganin's proposals to strengthen relations between the two countries through specific measures such as developing scientific and technological cooperation and establishing consulates in each other's countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 2nd: West Berlin's "Telegraf" criticized Adenauer's attitude in his reply to Bulganin. The newspaper said: Adenauer once again evaded the task of putting forward constructive new proposals.

Bonn's "Allgemeine Zeitung," in commenting on Adenauer's reply, pointed out that the development of trade between West Germany and the Soviet Union was unsatisfactory. Exports from the Federal Republic to all Eastern European countries account for only 3% of West Germany's total exports, while in 1932, the Soviet Union accounted for more than 10% of Germany's exports.

The weekly "Voice of Peace" wrote, "Bonn's empty promises are shocking." It pointed out that relations between West Germany and the Soviet Union can only be improved if Bonn's policies are consistent in word and deed.

    在欧洲安全、统一德国和裁军等问题上
    阿登纳拒绝布尔加宁建议
    但同意发展两国的贸易和文化关系
    据新华社讯  波恩消息：德意志联邦共和国总理阿登纳2月22日答复了苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁就苏联和德意志联邦共和国两国关系问题给他的信件。西德政府在2月28日公布了阿登纳的复信。
    阿登纳在复信里为北大西洋集团辩护，他不承认西德正在被这个集团推上侵略的道路，并且要求苏联接受西德加入这个集团的“既成事实”。
    阿登纳不承认德意志民主共和国的存在，他说，不可能有“两个德国”的问题，并且重申举行所谓“自由选举”的主张。
    在谈到裁军问题的时候，阿登纳说，只有“克服政治方面现存的紧张局势的根源”和对核子武器实施“有效的监督”，才能“富有成效地”讨论裁军问题。
    同时，阿登纳表示同意布尔加宁提出的发展两国贸易关系以改善政治气候的建议。他并且建议两国政府在短时期内就这个问题举行谈判。阿登纳还引证了一些数字说明从1954年以来苏联和西德贸易额已经有了巨大的增长。
    阿登纳还表示同意布尔加宁提出的用发展科学技术合作和两国各在对方建立领事馆等具体措施来加强两国关系的建议。
    据新华社柏林2日电  西柏林“电讯报”对阿登纳在他给布尔加宁的复信中的态度提出了批评。这家报纸说：阿登纳再次规避了提出建设性的新建议的任务。
    波恩“一般新闻”在评论阿登纳的复信的时候指出，西德同苏联之间贸易的发展是不能令人满意的。联邦共和国同所有东欧国家的出口贸易只占西德全部出口贸易的3％，而1932年苏联在德国的出口贸易中所占的比例却在10％以上。
   “和平之声”周刊写道，“波恩的空洞保证是令人震惊的”。它指出，西德和苏联的关系只有在波恩的政策言行一致的情况下，才能得到改善。
