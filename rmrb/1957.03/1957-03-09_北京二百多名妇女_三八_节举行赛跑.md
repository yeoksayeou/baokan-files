    Hold Race for "March 8th" Festival
    (Our Newspaper) This morning, on "March 8th" Women's Day, two hundred and eleven women in Beijing held a one-kilometer race in front of Tiananmen Square.

    At 10:15 a.m., as the referee's gun fired, the female athletes lined up in front of the Beijing Hotel and ran vigorously towards the finish line - Tiananmen Square. Zhang Fenghua, a nineteen-year-old draftswoman from the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, took the lead and finished the entire course in three minutes, thirty-six and seven tenths seconds.

    The second and third places were taken by Zhang Shuyuan from the Beijing Construction Engineering Company (three minutes, forty-four and seven tenths seconds) and Ye Qixian from the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory (three minutes, forty-seven and four tenths seconds). (Shi Yuzhong)
