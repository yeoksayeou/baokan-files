    International Snippets
    Americans Look at Britain
    The American "Newsweek" reported on January 21 that Texas oil producers refused to increase production to support oil-starved Britain until oil prices rose. So the British thought that if Washington could put some pressure on Texas, the problem could be solved. But an American official said to the "Manchester Guardian" correspondent in the United States: "Go back and tell your British people that, for Washington, the 'independent' state of Texas is much more independent than the independent 'state' of Great Britain!"
    Prime Minister's Residence Surrounded
    On January 18 of this year, a group of drivers mobilized by the Tokyo Taxi Association drove sixty cars to launch a petition against the government's increase in gasoline tax. At around 11 a.m. that day, this "team" surrounded the Prime Minister's residence in Nagata-cho, Tokyo. White cloth banners with the words "Oppose Increased Gasoline Tax" were erected next to the cars, and the drivers honked their horns to boost their momentum.
    After the Prime Minister refused to meet with the petition representatives, all the drivers locked their cars and left them in front of the Prime Minister's residence. As a result, a 300-meter-long road was completely blocked by the cars, the Prime Minister's residence was surrounded, and the cabinet meeting could not be held on time.

    美国人看英国
    1月21日美国“新闻周刊”载称，美国得克萨斯州的石油生产商在石油没有涨价以前拒绝增加生产来支援闹石油荒的英国。于是英国人就想，如果华盛顿肯对得克萨斯州施加一点压力，应该就可以解决问题了。那知道，一个美国官员对“曼彻斯特卫报”的驻美记者说：“回去告诉你们英国人，对华盛顿来说，得克萨斯这个‘独立’州可要比大不列颠这个独立‘州’要独立得多！”
    首相官邸被围困
    今年1月18日，日本东京出租汽车协会动员的一批司机，驾驶着六十辆汽车，发起了反对政府提高挥发油税的请愿。当天上午十一时左右，这支“队伍”把东京永田町的首相官邸包围起来。汽车旁边竖立着写有“反对增征挥发油税”字样的白布标语，司机们大按喇叭，以壮声势。
    在首相拒绝接见请愿代表后，全部司机锁上了车，把车丢在首相官邸门前。这一来，使一条三百公尺长的马路全部被车子所堵塞，首相官邸被围困，内阁会议也没有能按时开。
