Xinhua News Agency, 29th. The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace issued a statement opposing the British hydrogen bomb test on Christmas Island. The full text is as follows:

    Currently, the call for the prohibition of nuclear weapons, opposition to nuclear weapons testing, and opposition to the expansion of military bases, including the establishment of hydrogen bombs and missiles, by the United States is growing louder and louder among the people of Asian, Latin American, and other countries around the world. The Japanese people, who have suffered several times from American atomic disasters, are waging tireless and courageous struggles against nuclear weapons and the establishment of atomic bases in Japan. However, the American aggressive bloc has consistently disregarded the opposition and protests of the people of all countries and broad public opinion in the world, and has never relaxed its atomic blackmail policy in an attempt to intensify international tensions and prepare for new wars of aggression, thereby seriously threatening the peace and security of the people of all countries in the world.

    The United States continues to expand atomic military bases everywhere, expand the armed forces and nuclear weapons equipment of the North Atlantic military group, and plan to set up missiles in Asia, including Japan and the Taiwan region, in Europe, including the countries of the North Atlantic Group, and in Latin America. Recently, the US-British Bermuda talks, in violation of the will of the people of the world, openly announced their refusal to stop nuclear weapons testing, while Britain, which dreams of strengthening its position by relying on American military power, also ignores the appeals and protests of various countries and insists on carrying out nuclear weapons explosion tests on Christmas Island. All this is a direct challenge to all peace-loving people and countries.

    We, the Chinese people, have always opposed the use and testing of nuclear weapons. We support the recent Soviet proposal in the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee on the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons and the immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing. We also support the Soviet government's recent proposal to conclude a temporary agreement to suspend the testing of these weapons before a permanent agreement is reached on the cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapons testing. The Chinese people are willing to stand firmly with the people of Asia and the world to defeat the imperialist policy of war preparation, to prohibit the use and cessation of nuclear weapons testing, to further ease international tensions, and to continue to contribute our strength to the struggle for lasting peace.

### 中国人民保卫世界和平委员会发表声明　反对英国在圣诞岛试验氢弹

　　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会发表声明
　　反对英国在圣诞岛试验氢弹
    新华社29日讯  中国人民保卫世界和平委员会反对英国在圣诞岛试验氢弹的声明。全文如下：
    目前，亚洲、拉丁美洲以及全世界其他地区各国人民要求禁止核子武器、反对试验核子武器、反对美国扩建包括设置氢弹和导弹在内的军事基地的呼声正在越来越高涨。几次遭受美国原子灾害的日本人民，为反对核子武器和反对在日本设立原子基地而进行着不懈的勇敢的斗争。但是，美国侵略集团却始终不顾世界各国人民和广大社会舆论的反对和抗议，从来没有放松过它的原子讹诈政策，以图加剧国际紧张局势，准备新侵略战争，从而严重地威胁全世界各国人民的和平和安全。
    美国直到今天还在到处扩建原子军事基地，扩充北大西洋军事集团武装部队和核子武器装备，并且策划在包括日本和台湾地区的亚洲、包括北大西洋集团各国的欧洲和拉丁美洲设置导弹。最近，美英百慕大会谈更违背全世界人民的意志，公然宣布拒绝停止试验核子武器，而妄想依靠美国军事力量来加强自己地位的英国，也不顾各国人民的呼吁和抗议，坚持要在圣诞岛进行核子武器爆炸试验。这一切是对所有爱好和平的人民和国家的直接挑战。
    我们中国人民一贯反对使用和试验核子武器，我们赞成最近苏联在联合国裁军小组委员会上提出的关于禁止使用核子武器和立即停止试验核子武器的主张，也赞成苏联政府最近提出的在未达成永久停止试验原子武器和氢武器的协议以前缔结一项暂时中止试验这些武器的协定的建议。中国人民愿意和亚洲及全世界人民坚决地站在一起，为击败帝国主义的备战政策，为禁止使用和停止试验核子武器，为进一步缓和国际局势和争取持久和平而继续贡献我们的力量。
