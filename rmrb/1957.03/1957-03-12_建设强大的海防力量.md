Building a Strong Naval Defense Force

The representative meeting of naval activists of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has successfully concluded. At this meeting, representatives of advanced figures and advanced units from various arms of the navy, schools, and organs at all levels fully exchanged their advanced experiences in defending the motherland, escorting and protecting fisheries, and in modernization construction, and contributed their wisdom to the future naval construction cause of the people. This will be a tremendous driving force for strengthening the construction work in all aspects of the navy and completing future naval defense tasks.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy was established on the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the excellent traditions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and has developed in the continuous struggle against the enemy. It has now become a modern navy composed of fleets, aviation units, air defense units, coastal defense, and other ground forces. When the naval force was first established, it actively cooperated with the army in the liberation operations of the Shengsi Islands, Zhoushan Islands, and Wanshan Islands. Naval officers and soldiers, who had just been separated from the army, were not yet accustomed to life at sea. However, with extremely perseverance, they overcame various difficulties in the raging waves and bravely and tenaciously completed their combat tasks. In the battle to liberate Yijiangshan Island, the young navy, which had grown up, together with the army and air force, pioneered the precedent of coordinated operations of various modern arms and services in the history of our army. At the same time, the naval torpedo boat unit, in its first battle, won the victory of sinking the enemy warships "Taiping" and "Dongting" with brave, tenacious, flexible, and mobile combat actions. In the past few years, the navy has also cooperated with the army and air force to severely combat the enemy's harassment and sabotage activities in our coastal areas. Naval fleets have patrolled and guarded the sea day and night, protecting the safety of the motherland's territorial waters.

In the past few years, the navy has undertaken escort and fishery protection missions, ensuring the safety of China's import and export trade. From 1950 to 1956, the navy escorted 5,986 voyages of Chinese merchant ships and foreign merchant ships to and from China, and protected more than 440,000 fishing boats safely engaged in fishing production at sea. For example, in April 1955, the Chinese ship "Democracy No. 3," fully loaded with more than 1,300 passengers (excluding children), hit a reef in the East China Sea, and the ship sank, causing panic throughout the ship. At that time, the naval officers and soldiers on board made correct emergency arrangements for all the passengers, and naval warships rushed to rescue, and finally, all 1,000 people on board were saved. In addition, some warships also took on the task of transporting grain for disaster relief in the Yangtze River, transporting 180,000 tons of grain. Naval officers and soldiers showed a high degree of socialist consciousness and overcame many difficulties in completing these tasks, supporting national economic construction.

The officers and soldiers of the naval artillery units, fortress units, observation and communication units, and engineering units stationed on the coastal islands of our country not only tirelessly and day and night built coastal defense fortifications, monitoring the territorial waters of the motherland, and turning the islands into fortresses to defend the sea frontiers of the motherland; at the same time, they also transformed the natural environment with their own hands, changing the face of barren islands overgrown with weeds and rarely visited by people. They helped the island residents establish cooperatives and develop fisheries and agricultural production, and forged deep friendships with the people on the island.

The naval force, which inherited and carried forward the excellent traditions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, showed the same socialist enthusiasm and spirit of overcoming difficulties in the aspect of troop training as in defending the motherland's naval defense and supporting national economic construction. The navy is a multi-service arm with complex technical equipment. In the past few years, the vast number of naval officers and soldiers have carried out continuous, intense, diligent study and hard training to improve their professional and technical level, and have made great achievements in modernization and regularization construction. According to incomplete statistics, in the past year alone, more than 18,000 technical experts, more than 3,800 excellent students, and more than 3,500 advanced workers have emerged. At the same time, in order to overcome various specific difficulties in training and engineering construction, the vast number of officers and soldiers put forward 4,843 rationalization proposals and 1,427 inventions in the past year. These rationalization proposals and inventions not only played an important role in the navy's operations and training, but also saved a lot of money for the country. For example, the Naval Exhibition, which opened at the same time as the Naval Activists Representative Meeting, introduced the improved processing method of copper tubes initiated by Cao Fengyi, a technician of the Naval Ordnance Department, which saved the country 60,000 yuan in one year and saved more than one ton of copper. He also used the old torpedoes in stock to modify training torpedoes, saving the country 750,000 yuan. These rationalization proposals and inventions of the vast number of naval officers and soldiers most concretely and vividly show how they are implementing the spirit of building the army through diligence and thrift with active actions.

These hard creative labor and struggles carried out by the vast number of naval officers and soldiers in naval construction and naval defense have important significance for safeguarding the great socialist cause of our motherland. Our country has more than 12,000 kilometers of coastline. Historically, imperialism has mostly launched aggressive wars against our country from the sea. In the old China era, the Qing Dynasty and the Kuomintang ruling group had established navies, but the navies they established did not become a naval defense force sufficient to defend against imperialist aggression. The People's Navy, in such a short period of time, has been able to build a maritime defense force of this scale today, which is inseparable from the superiority of the socialist system and from the fact that all officers and soldiers of the People's Navy have inherited the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army. Because the construction and development of the navy depends on the country's industrialization and the improvement of science and technology, in order to ensure our country's security and independence, the people of the whole country, especially the industrial and cultural and scientific departments, should strive to develop production, develop our country's scientific undertakings, and care about and support the growth of naval defense forces. The People's Navy must continue to carry forward the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army, first of all, continue to carry forward the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, improve political awareness, and vigilantly defend naval defense security and national construction. Secondly, in combat and training, we must cherish equipment, save money, implement the spirit of "building the army through diligence and thrift," and support national construction. Third, we must implement the mass line in all our work, give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of officers and soldiers, and strive to improve our military technical level. In today's world, where military science and technology are changing rapidly, especially the application of atomic, jet, and rocket weapons in the military, even if we master the existing equipment, newer technologies are still waiting for us to master. All officers and soldiers of the People's Navy should strive to master modern military science and technology and achieve newer achievements in modern military construction.

### 建设强大的海防力量

    建设强大的海防力量
    中国人民解放军海军积极分子代表会议已经圆满闭幕。在这个会议上，海军各兵种部队、各学校、各级机关的先进人物和先进单位的代表们，充分地交流了在保卫祖国、护航护渔，以及现代化建设中的各种先进经验，并且对今后人民海军建设事业，贡献了他们的智慧。这对于加强海军各方面的建设工作和完成今后的海防任务，将是一个巨大的推动力量。
    中国人民解放军海军是在继承和发扬了中国人民解放军优良传统的基础上建立起来的，是在同敌人不断的斗争中发展起来的，现在已经成为一支由舰艇部队、航空兵部队和防空兵部队，以及海岸防御和其他地面部队所组成的现代化的海军。海军部队开始建立起来的时候，就积极配合陆军参加了解放嵊泗列岛、舟山群岛、万山群岛的作战。刚刚脱离陆军不久的海军官兵，还不习惯于海上生活，但是，他们以极坚忍的毅力在惊涛骇浪中克服了各种困难，英勇顽强地完成了自己所担负的战斗任务。在解放一江山岛的作战中，已经成长起来的年轻海军，同陆军和空军一起首创了我国军队历史上各现代化军种、兵种协同作战的先例。同时，海军鱼雷快艇部队在它的初战中，以英勇顽强机智灵活的战斗行动获得了击沉敌军舰太平号和洞庭号的胜利。过去几年来，海军还配合陆军和空军严重地打击了敌人对我沿海地区的骚扰破坏活动，海军舰艇部队日夜在海上巡逻警戒，保卫着祖国领海的安全。
    过去几年来，海军担负了护航护渔任务，保障了我国进出口贸易的安全。从1950年到1956年，海军护航我国商船和来往我国的外国商船达五千九百八十六艘次，保护渔船四十四万多只次安全地在海上进行了捕鱼生产。例如1955年4月间，满载着一千三百多名（儿童未计）乘客的我国轮船“民主三号”，在东海触礁，船身下沉，全船慌乱。当时乘船的人民海军官兵，对全船乘客作了正确的临危处置，海军军舰又赶来救援，终于使全船一千多人全部得救。此外，一部分军舰还在长江里担负了运粮救灾任务，先后运粮十八万吨。海军官兵在完成这些任务中表现了高度的社会主义觉悟和克服了许多困难，支援了国家经济建设。
    守卫在我国沿海岛屿上的海军炮兵部队、要塞部队、观察和通讯部队以及工程部队的官兵们，不但不知疲劳不分昼夜地建筑着海防工事，监视着祖国的领海，把岛屿变成捍卫祖国海疆的堡垒；同时，还用自己的双手改造着自然环境，使杂草丛生人迹罕到的荒岛改变了面貌。他们帮助岛上居民建立合作社和发展渔业、农业生产，跟岛上的人民群众结下了深厚的友谊。
    继承和发扬了中国人民解放军优良传统的海军部队，在保卫祖国海防和支援国家经济建设方面所表现的社会主义积极性和克服困难的精神，也同样表现在部队训练工作方面。海军是一个技术装备复杂的多兵种的军种。几年来，海军的广大官兵群众为了提高自己的业务技术水平而进行了持续的紧张的勤学苦练，在现代化、正规化建设中取得了很大成就。据不完全的统计，仅在去年一年中，就涌现了一万八千多名技术能手，三千八百多名优秀学员和三千五百多名先进工作者。同时，为了克服训练工作和工程建设中的各种具体困难，在去年一年中，广大官兵群众所提出的合理化建议达四千八百四十三件，还有发明创造一千四百二十七件。这些合理化建议和发明创造，不但对海军的作战和训练起了重要作用，而且为国家节省了大量的资财。例如，与海军积极分子代表会议同时开幕的海军展览会，介绍了海军军械部技术员曹凤仪所倡议改进的紫铜管加工方法，仅在一年中就为国家节省了六万元，还节省了一吨多铜。他还利用库存的旧鱼雷改装了训练雷，为国家节省了七十五万元。海军广大官兵群众的这些合理化建议和发明创造，最具体最生动地显示了他们如何用积极的行动贯彻着勤俭建军的精神。
    海军广大官兵群众在海军建设和保卫海防中所进行的这些辛勤的创造性的劳动和斗争，对保卫我们祖国的伟大社会主义事业有着重要的意义。我国有长达一万二千多公里的海岸线。从历史上看，帝国主义多半从海上对我国发动侵略战争。在旧中国时代里，清朝和国民党统治集团都曾经建立过海军，但是他们所建立的海军，都没有成为足以防御帝国主义侵略的海防力量。人民海军在这样短短的时期中，能够建成今天这样规模的海上防御力量，是同社会主义制度的优越性分不开的，是同人民海军全体官兵继承了人民解放军的光荣传统分不开的。由于海军的建设和发展，要依靠国家的工业化和科学技术水平的提高，为着确保我国的安全和独立，全国人民特别是工业部门和文化科学部门应该努力发展生产，发展我国的科学事业，关心和支援海防力量的壮大。人民海军要继续发扬人民解放军的光荣传统，首先是继续发扬全心全意为人民服务的精神，提高政治觉悟，警惕地保卫海防安全和国家建设。其次，在战斗和训练中要爱护装备，节省资财，贯彻“勤俭建军”的精神，支援国家建设。第三，要在一切工作中贯彻群众路线，发挥广大官兵的积极性和创造性，努力提高军事技术水平。在世界各国军事科学技术日新月异，尤其是原子、喷气和火箭武器在军事上应用的今天，即使掌握了现有的装备，更新的技术也还在等待着我们去掌握。人民海军的全体官兵同志们应当努力掌握现代军事科学技术，在现代化军事建设中获得更新的成就。
