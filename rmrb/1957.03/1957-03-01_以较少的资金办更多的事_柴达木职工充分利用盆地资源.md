Xinhua News Agency report: Fully utilizing the internal resources of the Qaidam Basin to do more with less money is an important measure devised by the employees of the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry in increasing production and practicing economy.

In 1957, the state's investment in petroleum exploration in the Qaidam Basin was greatly reduced compared to 1956, but the tasks increased by 9.37% compared to last year. After preliminary discussions by the bureau's employees, they not only have the confidence to complete the tasks assigned by the state, but also have full confidence to over fulfill the state's drilling footage plan by 20%. The drilling cost per meter can be reduced by 200 yuan compared to last year.

The main methods they have devised are to fully utilize the internal resources of the Qaidam Basin and the internal resources of the enterprise. In the past few years, all the materials used for petroleum exploration in the Qaidam Basin were transported from outside, and transportation costs alone accounted for about 70% of the total exploration cost. For example, most of the coal used to be transported from Hami, Xinjiang, costing about 500 yuan per ton; kerosene and gasoline were even more expensive after being transported long distances into the basin. After studying this situation, the employees plan to use all the coal from the Yuka and Yeyang coal mines in the basin this year. Regarding kerosene and gasoline, they plan to use the crude oil gushing from exploration wells such as Leng Lake and Youquanzi to build two small refineries to produce some kerosene and gasoline themselves. Within the enterprise, they originally planned to increase drilling rigs, seismographs, and other equipment, but now they have decided not to increase them. They have also devised methods such as waste recovery and saving raw materials. For example, drilling mud and drill bits are very valuable, and this year they will try to recover and reuse them. In the past, casing was used for drilling regardless of whether it was needed underground; large casings were sometimes used even when small casings should have been used. Now they have specifically analyzed the underground conditions and determined to use less casing where it does not affect drilling, and to use small casings as much as possible.

### 以较少的资金办更多的事  柴达木职工充分利用盆地资源

    以较少的资金办更多的事
    柴达木职工充分利用盆地资源
    据新华社讯  充分利用柴达木盆地内部资源，以较少的钱办更多的事，是石油工业部青海石油勘探局职工在增产节约中想出的重要措施的一部分。
    1957年国家为柴达木盆地石油勘探拨出的投资比1956年减少了很多，而任务却比去年增加了9.37％。经过这个局的职工初步讨论的结果，不仅有信心完成国家交给的任务，而且还有充分信心超额完成国家钻井进尺计划20％。钻探成本每一公尺可以比去年降低二百元。
    他们想的办法主要是充分利用柴达木盆地内部资源和企业内部资源。过去的几年，柴达木盆地石油勘探所用的一切物资，都是从外部运入，光运输费用就占去勘探总成本的70％左右。比如原来用的煤大部分是从新疆的哈密运来，每吨煤需要五百元左右；煤油和汽油经过长途运进盆地，价格就更高了。职工们研究了这种情况以后，今年准备全部利用盆地里鱼卡煤矿和野羊煤矿的煤。关于煤油和汽油问题，他们准备利用冷湖和油泉子等探井喷出的原油，搞两个小型炼油厂，自己炼制一部分煤油、汽油。在企业内部，他们原来计划增加的钻机、地震仪等设备，现在决定不再增加。他们还想出废料回收、节省原材料等办法。比如钻井用的泥浆、钻头都是很贵重的东西，今年要设法回收，再加以利用。以往钻井不管井下需要不需要都一律使用套管；应该使用小套管有时也用了大的。现在他们具体分析了井下的情况，确定在不影响钻进的情况下少用套管，并尽可能使用小套管。
