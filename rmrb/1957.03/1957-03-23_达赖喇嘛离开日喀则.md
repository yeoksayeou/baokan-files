The Dalai Lama stayed in Shigatse for a total of eighteen days. During this time, he met with the Panchen Erdeni, and the two had several cordial conversations. The Dalai Lama also lectured on the scriptures and received worship from the entire monastic and lay community here. In addition, the Dalai Lama listened to a work report from Jiantong Jijinmei, the director of the Shigatse Basic Qiao Office. The Dalai Lama expressed satisfaction with Jiantong Jijinmei's report and gave instructions on cultivating cadres and Tibetan and Han cadres working together through consultation. He said: The unity of the Tibetan and Han nationalities and within the Tibetan nationality must be strengthened in order to do a good job.

On his way back to Lhasa, the Dalai Lama will also lecture on the scriptures and worship Buddha at some temples along the way. It is expected that he will arrive in Lhasa in early April.
