    Launch the Masses to Deepen the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement
    The Office of the Industry Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Currently, the increase production and practice economy movement in Beijing's state-owned factories and mines is gradually unfolding. In larger factories and mines, the annual production plans of most units have been initially determined. Increase production and practice economy plans have also been formulated. According to statistics from twenty-nine units that have already formulated production plans, the total value of production in 1957 will increase by 3.2% compared to the 1956 plan, but decrease by 2.6% compared to the actual completion in 1956. According to preliminary statistics from twenty-six units that have already formulated increase production and practice economy plans, it is estimated that 19.19 million yuan can be increased or saved this year, including 13.08 million yuan in increased production, accounting for 4.24% of the planned total value of production of these units in 1957, and 6.11 million yuan in savings. Some units have already taken the increase production and practice economy plans to the masses for discussion. The masses are very enthusiastic about the increase production and practice economy movement. They have come up with many measures and methods to save raw materials, improve production efficiency, improve product quality, and reduce costs. With the help of the work group of the Ministry of Coal Industry, the engineering and technical personnel of the Jingxi Mining Bureau conducted a comprehensive review of the existing mine tunnels, corrected the past shortcomings of dispersed coal mining areas and excessive ineffective footage, and made reasonable adjustments to the tunnel layout. After the adjustment in Fangshan Mine, the average footage required for every 1,000 tons of coal mined can be reduced from 54.72 meters in 1956 to 52 meters, saving 630,000 yuan in tunneling costs for the whole year. In order to save steel, the First Machine Tool Plant reviewed all the drawings of parts made of steel, and adopted methods such as modifying the design, improving the process, and reducing the machining allowance. It is estimated that 130 kilograms of steel can be saved for each universal milling machine, saving 65 tons of steel for the whole year. Some units have launched the movement relatively quickly and smoothly and a new atmosphere has emerged in production, because the leadership attached importance to it and earnestly mobilized the masses.

    However, some units are still in the stage of leadership accounting, formulating plans, and deliberation and discussion. The increase production and practice economy plans have not yet met the masses, and the masses have not been fully mobilized. This is a problem that urgently needs to be solved in the current movement.

    According to recent inspections, conservative ideas still exist to varying degrees among the leading personnel of some enterprises. This conservative thinking is manifested in:

    First, the increase production and practice economy plans are set too low. For example, the tram company's planned operating income this year (calculated based on the tram part) is 5.8% higher than the actual income last year, but the planned profit to be turned over is 51% lower than the actual profit turned over last year (the profit turned over last year was 1.09 million yuan, and the planned profit to be turned over this year is 540,000 yuan). The actual unit cost in 1956 was 0.3319 yuan/kilometer, while the plan for this year is 0.377 yuan/kilometer. The actual power consumption in 1956 was 0.423 kWh/kilometer, while the planned power consumption for this year's increase production and practice economy plan is 0.43 kWh/kilometer. The conditions in all aspects this year are roughly the same as last year, so this is obviously conservative.

    Due to the conservative thinking of the leadership and the failure to earnestly mobilize the masses, some units were very perfunctory when discussing the increase production and practice economy plans. Some just formally passed the figures put forward by the leadership. For example, six of the eight coal mining teams in Dattai Mine of the Jingxi Mining Bureau formulated increase production and practice economy plans in January, but the increase production and practice economy plans of all six teams were lower than their already achieved production levels. Such conservative plans, of course, cannot play a role in promoting production. Some units did not conduct serious investigation and research to understand the situation and tap potential when formulating increase production and practice economy plans. The increase production and practice economy plans of some units are not comprehensive enough. They generally pay more attention to saving production costs and ignore saving management costs. Among production costs, they pay more attention to saving main raw materials and special raw materials, and ignore saving auxiliary materials and general materials. In fact, the waste in these areas is very large. The increase production and practice economy plans of some units only have general figures and lack specific technical and organizational measures.

    Second, they are slow to mobilize the masses. The leading personnel of some units have been staying in the stage of surveying the situation, accounting, and formulating increase production and practice economy plans for a long time, and have not mobilized the masses in a timely manner. The leading personnel of some units one-sidedly emphasize that work should be planned and step-by-step, preparing to first inside the Party and then outside the Party, first cadres and then the masses, first departments and then workshops, and holding a series of meetings to pass down plans layer by layer. In this way, some units will not be able to take the increase production and practice economy plans to the masses for discussion until March or even April. Some leaders also have a passive and slack mood because the supply of raw materials is tight and the production tasks are reduced this year, and they think that it does not matter if the masses are not mobilized.

    Third, the leading personnel of some units do not fully understand the special importance of this year's increase production and practice economy movement, and do not regard it as an urgent political task at present. Some people think: "The increase production and practice economy movement is carried out every year, isn't it just the same old routine," so they are not very enthusiastic. Some people think that their units are "small and there is not much profit to be made, so there is nothing to increase production or practice economy." Some people also put increasing production and practicing economy in opposition to improving product quality, thinking that if they want to improve quality, they cannot increase production and practice economy.

    The fact that the planned total value of production in this year's annual production plans of factories and mines is lower than the actual level of last year is a problem that should arouse our serious attention. If we do not actively work hard and vigorously increase production and practice economy, it will not only affect the completion of the first five-year plan, but also affect the preparation work for the second five-year plan. At present, there is great potential for increase production and practice economy in enterprises. As long as the leadership attaches importance to it and the work is done well, the potential can be tapped and some difficulties can be overcome. The central issue of the current movement lies in: opposing and overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking, and quickly and vigorously mobilizing the masses.

    We have the following opinions on further developing the increase production and practice economy movement:

    First, oppose and prevent conservative tendencies, and continue to implement the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee on demanding ourselves with the highest possible standards and learning from the advanced levels in the country. Last year, factories and mines made a lot of efforts in this regard and achieved great results. This year, we should continue to implement and execute this, and first of all, we should compare various production indicators with those of advanced factories across the country, especially economic indicators (such as raw material consumption quotas, management costs, and costs). Find out the advantages of others and our own shortcomings from the comparison to spur ourselves to continue to move forward. We must earnestly learn from the advanced experience of brother factories and improve our work.

    Second, clarify the direction of increase production and practice economy, and formulate and revise increase production and practice economy plans and technical and organizational measures plans. Within the scope permitted by raw materials and the market, all enterprises must strive to increase the quantity and variety of products, improve the quality of products, and reduce the cost of products. At the same time, different types of enterprises should determine their own direction and goals of increase production and practice economy according to their own situations and conditions.

     (1) Enterprises such as steel, coal mines, and power plants should improve production indicators as much as possible, find effective ways to increase production, take the most effective technical and organizational measures, and do their best to overfulfill the national plan.

     (2) Enterprises such as machinery, textiles, and papermaking should vigorously reduce raw material consumption quotas, establish and improve raw material management systems to reduce raw material consumption and increase production. They should widely use substitute materials under the premise of ensuring quality, make full use of waste materials to develop new raw material resources, and increase production. In particular, they should vigorously save main materials and fuels such as steel, coal, coke, and electricity.

     (3) Enterprises such as railways, post and telecommunications, and transportation should improve the work efficiency of equipment and personnel and strengthen scheduling work to increase transportation and communication capacity. Transportation departments should strive to save fuel consumption. Telecommunications departments should strive to save electricity consumption.

     (4) Newly built factories should carefully do a good job in civil engineering and equipment installation projects, reduce rework and waste. They should strengthen the trial production of new products and strive to start production ahead of schedule. They should try to save national investment, compress various expenses and management costs.

    In implementing the increase production and practice economy, strive to improve product quality and work quality; pay attention to safety and prevent accidents from happening.

    Third, deeply mobilize the masses, carry out labor competitions and advanced producer movements. Those who have initially formulated increase production and practice economy plans should quickly mobilize the masses to discuss them. Those who have not yet formulated increase production and practice economy plans can formulate plans while mobilizing the masses. Mobilizing the masses must first start with education. Some factories organized department personnel to report to the workers and masses on the waste phenomena in the factory's production and management, and used vivid examples and specific figures to illustrate the problems, which greatly enlightened the masses. Some units adopted the method of revealing waste phenomena while mobilizing the masses, calculating detailed accounts, and proposing improvement measures at the same time, and the effect was very good. Because doing so can combine improving the masses' understanding with solving practical problems, combine revealing problems with improving work, and combine the masses' self-education with overcoming bureaucracy on the part of the leadership.

    Promoting advanced experience is the central content of the increase production and practice economy movement. Whether the movement can effectively achieve results, the key issue lies in promoting advanced experience. In last year's advanced producer movement, some units had already accumulated some experience in this regard. This year, they should formulate a comprehensive plan for promoting advanced experience based on the requirements of production development and the needs of increase production and practice economy on the basis of summarizing last year's work, mobilize the masses, and earnestly learn from and promote advanced experience. Through the advanced producer movement, better achieve the goal of increase production and practice economy. Make the indicators of increase production and practice economy a condition for evaluating advanced producers, and conduct regular evaluations.

    Fourth, the increase production and practice economy movement should be combined with improving enterprise management. Carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement will not only accumulate wealth for the country (of course, this is the most important), but also promote the improvement of enterprise management. At present, in terms of management, we must pay special attention to: cleaning up warehouses; sorting out waste and old materials; improving the material receiving and issuing and storage systems; formulating and revising raw material consumption quotas; strictly controlling various expenditures; strengthening economic accounting, and promoting workshop economic accounting and team economic accounting step by step according to specific conditions. At the same time, we must carefully handle rationalization proposals.

    Fifth, rationally adjust the existing organizations and personnel, and greatly reduce enterprise management costs. Combine the work of streamlining institutions and staffing with improving working methods, improving leadership, and improving work efficiency.

    At present, there is a lot of work to be done in factories and mines. The work of the Party committee should consider increase production and practice economy as the center and make appropriate arrangements for other work. Put the main strength of the leadership into the increase production and practice economy movement.

    发动群众深入开展增产节约运动
    中共北京市委工业部办公室
    目前，北京市国营厂矿企业的增产节约运动正在逐步开展。在较大厂矿中，多数单位的年度生产方案已经初步确定。增产节约计划方案也订出来了。根据二十九个已经制定了生产方案的单位统计，1957年总产值将比1956年计划增加3.2％，比1956年实际完成减少2.6％。根据二十六个已经制定增产节约计划的单位的初步统计，今年可以增产节约一千九百十九万元，其中增产一千三百零八万元，占这些单位1957年计划总产值的4.24％；节约六百十一万元。有些单位已经把增产节约计划方案拿到群众中进行了讨论。群众对增产节约运动热情很高，他们从节约原材料，提高生产效率，改进产品质量，降低成本等方面想出了很多措施和办法。京西矿务局的工程技术人员在煤炭工业部工作组的帮助下，对现有各矿坑道进行了全面审查，纠正了过去采煤区域分散，无效进尺多的缺点，对坑道布置作了合理调整。房山矿在调整后，平均每采一千吨煤所需要的掘进尺度可以由1956年的五十四点七二公尺降低到五十二公尺，全年可以节约掘进费六十三万元。第一机床厂为了节约钢材，对全部用钢材制造的零件图纸进行了审查，采取修改设计、改进工艺、减少加工余量等方法，预计每台万能铣床所用钢材可节约一百三十公斤，全年可以节约钢材六十五吨。有些单位由于领导重视，认真发动了群众，因此运动开展得比较迅速、顺利，生产上已经出现了新气象。
    但是，有些单位至今还处在领导算帐，订计划和酝酿讨论的阶段。增产节约计划方案还没有和群众见面，群众还没有充分发动起来。这是当前运动中的一个迫切需要解决的问题。
    根据最近检查，在某些企业领导人员中还存在着不同程度的保守思想。这种保守思想表现在：
    第一、增产节约计划订得偏低。如电车公司今年计划营业收入（按有轨电车部分计算）比去年实际收入增加5.8％，但计划上缴利润却比去年实际上缴利润减少51％（去年上缴利润为一百零九万元，今年计划上缴利润为五十四万元）。1956年实际单位成本为0.3319元／公里，而今年计划为0.377元／公里。1956年实际电耗为0.423度／公里，而今年增产节约计划电耗为0.43度／公里。今年各方面条件大体与去年相同，这样作显然是保守的。
    由于领导上存在着保守思想，没有认真地发动起群众，有些单位在讨论增产节约计划时很草率。有的只是形式地通过一下领导提出来的数字。如京西矿务局大台矿有八个回采组，1月份有六个组制定了增产节约计划，但六个组的增产节约计划都低于他们已经达到的生产水平。这样保守的计划，当然就起不了推动生产的作用。有些单位制定增产节约计划时没有认真进行调查研究，摸清情况，挖掘潜力。有些单位的增产节约计划订得不够全面。一般比较重视生产费用的节约而忽视管理费用的节约。在生产费用中又比较重视主要原材料和特殊原材料的节约，而忽视辅助材料和一般材料的节约。实际上这些方面的浪费是很大的。有些单位的增产节约计划只有笼统数字，缺乏具体的技术组织措施。
    第二、迟迟不发动群众。有的单位的领导人员长期停留在摸底、算帐、制定增产节约计划方案上，没有及时地发动群众。有的单位领导人员片面强调工作要有计划和步骤，准备先党内后党外，先干部后群众，先科室后车间，召开一系列的会议，层层下达计划。这样，有的单位要到3月甚至4月才能把增产节约计划拿到群众中去讨论。还有的领导人员因为今年原材料供应紧张，生产任务缩减，就产生了一种消极松懈情绪，认为不发动群众没有关系。
    第三、有些单位的领导人员对于今年增产节约运动的特殊重要意义认识不足，没有把它看成是当前的一项迫切的政治任务。有人认为：“年年搞增产节约，还不是老一套”，因此劲头不大。有人认为自己单位“摊子小，油水不大，没有什么可以增产节约的”。也有人把搞增产节约同提高产品质量对立起来，认为要提高质量，就不能增产节约。
    今年各厂矿的年度生产方案中总产值计划低于去年的实际水平，这是一个应当引起我们严重注意的问题。如果不积极努力，大力增产节约，不仅要影响第一个五年计划的完成，而且也将影响第二个五年计划的准备工作。目前企业中增产节约的潜力很大，只要领导重视，工作做得好，潜力可以挖出来，一些困难也可以克服。当前运动的中心问题在于：反对和克服右倾保守思想，迅速和大力发动群众。
    对于进一步开展增产节约运动，我们有以下几点意见：
    第一、反对和防止保守倾向，继续贯彻市委关于以可能达到的最高标准要求自己的工作，向全国先进水平看齐的指示。去年各厂矿企业在这方面作了很多工作，也取得了很大的成绩。今年应该继续贯彻执行，首先应该和全国各先进工厂比较各项生产指标，特别是对于经济指标（譬如原材料消耗定额，管理费用，成本等）要认真比较。从比较当中发现人家的优点和自己的缺点，来鞭策自己不断前进。要认真学习兄弟厂的先进经验，改进自己的工作。
    第二、明确增产节约方向，制定和修订增产节约计划和技术组织措施计划。在原材料和市场允许的范围内，一切企业都必须为增加产品的数量和品种，提高产品的质量，降低产品的成本而斗争。同时，不同类型的企业又应当根据自己的情况和条件，确定自己的增产节约方向和目标。
     （1）钢铁、煤矿、电力等企业应当尽可能的提高生产指标，寻找增产的有效办法，采取最能见效的技术组织措施，尽最大努力超额完成国家计划。
     （2）机器、纺织、造纸等企业，应当大力降低原材料消耗定额，建立和健全原材料管理制度以减少原材料的耗损而增加生产。应当在保证质量的前提下，广泛采用代用材料，充分利用废料开辟新的原料资源，增加生产。特别对钢材、煤、焦炭、电力等主要材料和燃料要大力节约。
     （3）铁路、邮电、交通运输等企业应当提高设备和人员的工作效率，加强调度工作，以增加运输和通讯的能力。运输部门应当努力节约燃料的消耗。电信部门应当努力节约电力的消耗。
     （4）新建工厂应当认真做好土建工程和设备安装工程，减少反工浪费。要加强新产品的试制工作，争取提前开工生产。要尽量节约国家投资、压缩各项开支和管理费用。
    在贯彻增加生产和厉行节约工作中，努力提高产品质量和工作质量；注意安全，防止事故的发生。
    第三、深入发动群众，开展劳动竞赛和先进生产者运动。已经初步订出增产节约计划的要迅速动员群众进行讨论。尚未订出增产节约计划的可以一边发动群众，一边制定计划。发动群众首先要从教育着手。有的工厂组织科室人员，向职工群众报告本厂在生产上、管理上的浪费现象，并且用生动事例和具体数字来说明问题，对群众启发很大。有的单位采取了一边发动群众揭发浪费现象，一边算细账、一边提改进措施的办法，效果很好。因为这样做可以把提高群众认识同解决实际问题结合起来，把揭发问题同改进工作结合起来，把群众进行自我教育同克服领导方面的官僚主义结合起来。
    推广先进经验是增产节约运动的中心内容。运动能否切实收到效果，关键问题在于推广先进经验。在去年的先进生产者运动当中，有些单位在这方面已经积累了一些经验，今年要在总结去年工作的基础上，根据生产发展的要求和增产节约的需要，订出全面的推广先进经验的规划，发动群众，认真学习和推广先进经验。通过先进生产者运动，更好地达到增产节约的目的。把增产节约的指标做为评定先进生产者的条件，经常的进行评选。
    第四、增产节约运动要和改进企业管理相结合。开展增产节约运动，不但要为国家积累财富（当然这是首要的），而且要推动企业管理的改进。目前在管理方面要特别抓紧：清理仓库；整理废、旧材料；健全材料领退、保管制度；制定、修改原材料消耗定额；严格控制各项开支；加强经济核算，根据具体条件，有步骤的推行车间经济核算和班组经济核算。同时，还要慎重地处理合理化建议。
    第五、合理调整现有的机构和人员，大量削减企业管理费用。把精简机构、编制的工作同改进工作方法，改进领导，提高工作效率结合起来。
    目前厂矿中要做的工作很多，党委的工作就应当考虑以增产节约为中心并对其他工作作适当安排。把领导的主要力量放到增产节约运动上来。
