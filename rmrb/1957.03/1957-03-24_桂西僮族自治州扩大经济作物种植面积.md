　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, March 22nd: In the fields of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, after the spring rain cleared, farmers of all ethnic groups are busy planting economic crops such as sugarcane and peanuts. This year, the entire prefecture will plant two million mu of economic crops such as sugarcane and peanuts, an increase of 23% compared to last year. Yongning County, where sugarcane planting area accounts for a quarter of the prefecture's planting area, has completed 30% of its plan in the past ten days. Wuming, Hengxian, Fusui, Binyang, Ningming and other major peanut-producing counties have already planted 200,000 mu.

　　Since mid-February, the allocation of seedlings by agricultural cooperatives in various parts of the autonomous prefecture has begun. The state-owned Mingyang Farm has successively transferred three million jin of high-quality sugarcane seeds to nearby agricultural cooperatives that suffered from disasters last year. Wuming, Laibin, and other major peanut-producing counties also allocated more than 200,000 jin of peanut seeds to the Baise area in early March. Farmers of all ethnic groups in Yongning, Fusui, and other counties have adopted the method of intercropping corn with peanuts, so that each mu of land can harvest eighty or ninety jin to one hundred and fifty jin of peanuts, without affecting grain income.

　　Last year, the government built mechanical sugar factories and oil pressing factories in Yongning, Hengxian, Binyang, Tiandong, and other counties in the autonomous prefecture, which greatly encouraged farmers of all ethnic groups to develop economic crops.

　  桂西僮族自治州扩大经济作物种植面积
    新华社南宁22日电　在春雨初晴的桂西僮族自治州的田野上，各族农民正忙着种植甘蔗、花生等经济作物。今年全州将种植甘蔗、花生等经济作物二百万亩，比去年扩大23％。甘蔗种植面积占全州种植面积四分之一的邕宁县，十多天来已完成计划30％。花生的主要产区——武鸣、横县、扶绥、宾阳、宁明等县已经种下二十万亩。
    从二月中旬起，自治州各地农业社调拨种苗的工作就开始了。国营明阳农场先后调出了三百万斤甘蔗良种给附近去年受灾的农业社。武鸣、来宾等县花生主要产区于3月初也调拨了二十多万斤花生种子给百色地区。邕宁、扶绥等县各族农民采用玉米间种花生的办法，这样每亩地能收获花生八九十斤到一百五十斤，也不影响粮食收入。
    政府去年在自治州邕宁、横县、宾阳、田东等县建造了机械制糖厂和榨油厂，对各族农民发展经济作物起了很大的鼓舞作用。
