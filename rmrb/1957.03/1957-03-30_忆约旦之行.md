　　Remembering a Trip to Jordan
　　Hai Ping
            To Jordan
    One clear morning last winter, we—the Chinese trade delegation—after visiting Damascus, the capital of Syria, set off for the Kingdom of Jordan for a friendly visit. We were the second Chinese delegation to visit Jordan. Last August, the Chinese Hajj delegation had visited this country.
    From Damascus, after an hour and a half by car, we arrived at the border between Syria and Jordan. We presented our passports at the border. However, the people of Syria and Jordan can travel between the two countries without passports, only needing an identity card. The so-called border line is actually just a stone tablet about two feet wide and three feet high standing next to the road. Jordanian friends said that this is the boundary stone, and there used to be written explanations on the stone, but now even the writing is gone. This is because the people of Syria and Jordan proposed that this boundary stone was unnecessary, and requested the two governments to remove the words on the stone tablet to show the close unity of the two peoples. The two governments accepted this request from the people. Therefore, what we see now is just a smoothed stone strip.
    From the border to Amman, the capital of Jordan, is one hundred and ten kilometers. Along the way, apart from sparse fruit trees, it is bare everywhere. On that vast field, there is only wild grass that has already withered. However, these places are not desert areas, and the soil is not bad and can be used to grow crops. It is said that it is only because of the long-term plunder of Jordan by imperialism that the Jordanian people are unable to reclaim these vast and fertile lands, and even less able to mine the rich mineral deposits buried underground.
          In Amman City
    Amman is a beautiful mountain city. It is surrounded by seven low hills. Amman is quite lively, with cars on the streets like weaving. The sidewalks are very crowded.
    One beautiful evening, we took a car to tour the city. Our car climbed to the top of a hill. Standing on the top of the hill, the evening breeze blew on our faces, making us feel light and comfortable. Looking out from the mountain, a clear panoramic view of Amman was presented before our eyes.
    Amman does not have towering skyscrapers, but there are many three- or four-story buildings neatly arranged from the bottom of the mountain to the top. On the waist and slopes of each mountain, there are patches of small, scattered grasslands or small gardens. Shiny black asphalt roads wind around each mountain, meandering up and down, like a wide and smooth black ribbon circling around the waist of the mountain, sometimes visible and sometimes hidden.
    On the mountain where the Royal Palace is located in the east of Amman, there is a grove of trees and a garden with lush flowers and plants, which looks exceptionally neat and beautiful. The ancient knight helmet-shaped dome of the Royal Palace stands tall through the verdant trees, proudly overlooking the entire city. The national flag of the Kingdom of Jordan flutters in the wind, particularly eye-catching. In the northeast corner of that hilltop, the most striking thing is a four-story building not far from the Royal Palace. This is the British Embassy. Its faded cream-colored walls, in the slanting light of the setting sun, appear old and dull!
    Looking east again from the hilltop where the Royal Palace is located, you can see a vast area, which is Amman's three airports. One of them is the British Royal Air Force Airport, which is one of the British air bases in Jordan stipulated in the Anglo-Jordanian "Treaty of Alliance" signed in 1948; the other two are the Arab Legion's military airport and the civil aviation airport.
    Amman City begins to be immersed in twilight at six o'clock in the afternoon. By seven thirty, the shops close and businesses cease, pedestrians are scarce, and it appears exceptionally quiet.
          Jordan's Phosphate Mine
    The Ministry of Economy of the Kingdom of Jordan invited us to visit the phosphate mine operated by the Jordan Phosphate Mines Company. This phosphate mine is a joint venture between public and private entities, and is Jordan's first national enterprise. Private capital accounts for 51%, and state investment accounts for 49%. As a result of the long-term rule of imperialism, Jordan has almost no industry of its own, and some have not yet escaped the production methods of handicrafts workshops. We were naturally very pleased to see the enterprises operated by the Jordanian government and people using their own strength.
    It was originally agreed to go for a visit at 3:00 p.m., but the enthusiastic owner of the phosphate mine company, Mr. Daferg Kawar, came to our residence at 2:00 p.m. to wait for us. Therefore, we set off early without taking a nap.
    This mine is fifteen kilometers away from Amman. Not long after leaving Amman City, you can see many light railways laid on the undulating hills, extending to the mine tunnels, factories and warehouses. On the light railways, rows of trolleys loaded with ore are running. At the same time, the air compressors operating in the mine emit a rumbling sound, shaking the valley.
    When we arrived at the mine, we were warmly welcomed by the workers. They came up to greet us enthusiastically; some workers who were working also waved to us.
    This mine was discovered by Jordanians in 1934. According to the current preliminary estimates, the entire mining area covers an area of 60 hectares and has reserves of about 200 million tons. Initially, only a few workers were employed for manual production, and the annual output was very low. In 1945, stocks began to be raised to expand operations. However, funds were still insufficient, and there was very little mechanical equipment for production. Only tens of thousands of tons of calcium phosphate could still be produced each year. In 1953, the state invested, which enabled this enterprise to have new development. Now, mining tools, transportation tools, heating equipment, etc. have gradually been mechanized, and the number of workers has also increased to more than 1,400. By 1955, the output of calcium phosphate had reached 150,000 tons, and in 1956 it increased to 200,000 tons.
    We came to the mining site, and the owner led us into a mine tunnel. He introduced the ore layers with different phosphorus content. The best ore layer has a content of 72%, and the lowest also reaches 50%. The quality is very high. The ore layers are all on the surface of the stratum, making mining very convenient. We successively visited many mine tunnels, and finally arrived at a larger mine tunnel. This tunnel has been connected to the other end of the mine. It was dug through by the workers with their hands through fifteen years of hard work.
    In the exhibition room of this mine, various physical specimens that were mined were displayed. According to the investigation of these physical specimens, this mining area was a vast sea 40 to 50 million years ago, and it formed rich phosphate deposits after long-term geological changes. While explaining, Mr. Daferg Kawar took out many thick animal bones from the display cabinet, including various shapes of fish teeth. In 1945, a complete fish skeleton with a length of 12 meters was excavated here. Therefore, this phosphate mine is not only an enterprise, but also a valuable paleontology research institute.
    While resting in the office of the mine director, the owner talked about the development prospects of this mine. According to the preliminary development plan they are currently formulating, 360,000 tons of calcium phosphate will be produced in 1957, which is an 80% increase in output compared to 1956. In order to adapt to the needs of increasing production in 1957, various preparations are currently underway.
    The products of this mine are sold widely. According to the 1956 statistics, 90% of the products are supplied to foreign countries. Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, India, Italy and other countries purchased 80% of the annual output. Now other countries are also requesting to purchase, and the goods that have been traded have already been pre-ordered for the products of 1957.
    When bidding farewell to the owner, we sincerely congratulated the continuous development of this mining industry.
            Dead Sea
    Looking south from the Jordanian city of Jali-gu, you can see a calm, mirror-like sea surface, which is the famous "Dead Sea". Judging from the name "Dead Sea", it seems to be a useless sea. In fact, on the contrary, it is Jordan's natural wealth.
    The other side of the Dead Sea is the border of Israel. From Jali-gu to the seaside is about six kilometers, and a wide road has been built to connect them. For the convenience of tourists, there are hotels, cafes and restaurants by the sea.
    In the Dead Sea, you cannot see the turbulent waves that are common to ordinary oceans. We stayed there for half an hour and did not see a single white sail, nor did we see a seabird flying over. According to locals, the seawater here is saltier than other seawater, and people will float if they accidentally fall into the sea.
    Although there are no living things in the Dead Sea, potassium carbonate for fertilizer can be extracted from the sea water. There used to be a factory here that extracted potassium carbonate. It was jointly operated by British, Jewish and Arab shareholders, mainly British and Jewish capital. After the Palestinian incident in 1948, the factory was destroyed. Now the Jordanian government is planning to rebuild a factory.
          Foreign Trade
    During our visit to Jordan, we met with the Minister of Economy of the Kingdom of Jordan and had extensive contact with people in the business community. We deeply felt the strong desire of the Jordanian people to develop trade with China. The Jordanian Minister of Economy said: "In the past, Jordan was oppressed and invaded by the West, and we have had enough; now we should extricate ourselves from contact with the East!" At a forum held by the Jordanian business community, Jordanian business people expressed their desire to rapidly develop trade with China, and exchanged views with us on developing Sino-Jordanian trade. They have great confidence in the development prospects of trade between China and Jordan.
    After a long period of Western colonialism, Jordan's economy has fallen into a very backward state. Although Jordan gained independence after the Second World War, British imperialism still has great economic power in Jordan, hindering the independent development of Jordan's economy. Jordan has rich phosphate, iron and oil resources, but they have not been well exploited. Although Britain has provided so-called "aid" to Jordan, the result of this "aid" has been that the Jordanian people have been cruelly exploited by Britain.
    Jordan's agricultural economy is also underdeveloped, and the cultivated area accounts for only a small part of the total arable land area. The current cultivated area is only more than 9.5 million donums (one donum equals 1.36 acres), of which only 300,000 donums have irrigation, and the rest rely on natural rainfall. Grain cannot be self-sufficient and must rely on imports. Therefore, Jordan has a large trade deficit in foreign trade. From the total value of imports and exports from 1948 to 1955, annual imports are about ten times the value of exports. This serious trade deficit is the result of long-term enslavement and plunder by imperialism, and imperialism is precisely using Jordan's economic situation to realize its economic control over Jordan.
    However, Jordan has been developing independent foreign trade relations in recent years, striving to get rid of the economic constraints of imperialism. It can be seen that with Jordan's political independence, its desire to develop its own independent economy will surely be realized. (Attached picture)

### 忆约旦之行

　　忆约旦之行
　　海萍
            到约旦去
    去年冬天一个晴朗的早晨，我们——中国贸易代表团在访问了叙利亚首都大马士革之后，动身到约旦王国去进行友好访问。我们是访问约旦的第二个中国代表团。去年8月，中国朝觐团曾访问过这个国家。
    从大马士革出发，乘汽车行一小时半，就到了叙利亚和约旦的国境。我们在边境缴验了护照。但叙利亚和约旦人民的往来，是不用护照的，只需要有身份证就可以通行。所谓国境线，其实只是在公路旁边立着一块约两尺宽三尺高的石碑。约旦朋友说，这就是界石，以前界石上面还刻有文字说明，现在连文字也没有了。这是因为叙利亚和约旦两国人民提议不需要这个界石，要求两国政府把石碑上的字去掉，以表示两国人民的亲密团结。两国政府接受了人民的这个要求。因此，现在看到的只是一块磨平了的石条。
    从边境到达约旦首都安曼有一百一十公里。沿途，除了稀落的果树以外，到处光秃秃的，在那辽阔的田野上只有已经枯黄了的野草。但是，这些地方并不是沙漠地带，土质并不坏，可以种植农作物。据说，只是由于帝国主义对约旦的长期掠夺，使约旦人民无力在这些广阔而肥沃的土地上进行开垦，更无力采掘地下埋藏的丰富的矿藏。
          在安曼城
    安曼是一个美丽的山城。它的四周有七个不高的山头。安曼市内相当热闹，街上汽车如织。行人道上拥挤得很。
    在一个幽美的黄昏，我们乘着汽车游览了这个城市。我们的汽车爬上了一个山顶，站在山头上，晚风迎面吹来，使人轻快舒畅；凭山远望，安曼全景清晰地展现在眼前。
    安曼没有耸立苍空的高楼大厦，但从山下到山上，整齐地排列着许多三、四层的楼房。每座山的山腰间和山坡上，有一片片不大的分散着的草地或小花园。漆黑发亮的柏油公路绕着每一座山，蜿蜒上下，犹如一条宽阔光滑的黑色缎带萦回在山腰间，时隐时现。
    在安曼东边的王宫所在的那座山上，有一片树丛和花草茂密的园地，看起来异常整齐优美。王宫的古代骑士头盔形的圆屋顶，坚挺地透过苍翠的树丛，傲然地俯视着全城。约旦王国的国旗迎风招展，分外夺目。在那个山顶的东北角，最引人注意的是一幢距王宫不远的四层楼的楼房。这是英国大使馆。它那已褪了色的奶黄色的粉墙，在夕阳的斜照里，显得暮气沉沉！
    再经王宫所在的山头向东望去，可以看到一片辽阔的场地，那便是安曼的三个飞机场。其中有一个就是英国皇家空军机场，这是1948年签订的英约“同盟条约”中规定的英国在约旦的空军基地之一；另外两个是阿拉伯军团的军用机场和民用航空机场。
    安曼城在下午六点钟的时候就开始沉浸在黄昏里。到七点半钟，商店便关门息业，行人稀少，显得异常宁静。
          约旦的磷矿
    约旦王国经济部邀请我们参观约旦磷矿公司经营的磷矿。这个磷矿是公私合营的企业，并且是约旦第一个民族企业。其中私人资本占51％，国家投资占49％。由于帝国主义的长期统治的结果，约旦几乎没有自己的工业，有些还没有脱离手工工场的生产方式。这次我们能看到约旦政府和人民用自己的力量经营的企业，当然感到非常高兴。
    原来约好在下午三时前往参观，但是，热情的磷矿公司的主人达弗格卡瓦尔先生，在两点钟的时候就来到我们的住所等着我们了。于是，我们没有睡午觉就提前出发了。
    这个矿场离安曼十五公里。出了安曼城不久，就可以远远地看到在延绵起伏的山坡上铺设着许多条轻便铁道，分别伸向矿洞、厂房和仓库。在轻便铁道上，一列列装满矿石的斗车在运行。同时，矿场上开动着的空气压缩机，发出隆隆的响声，震动着山谷。
    我们到达矿场的时候，受到工人们的热烈欢迎，他们走拢来热情地向我们问好；有些正在工作的工人，也向我们招手致意。
    这个矿是在1934年为约旦人发现的。据现在的初步估计，整个矿区面积达六十公顷，蕴藏量约二亿吨。最初，只是雇用了少数工人用手工生产，每年产量很低。到1945年才开始招股，扩大经营。但是，资金还是不充裕，生产的机械设备也很少，每年仍只能出产数万吨磷酸钙。到1953年，国家进行了投资，使这个企业有了新的发展。现在，采掘工具、运输工具、加热设备等都逐渐机械化了，工人也增加到一千四百多人。到1955年，出产的磷酸钙已达到十五万吨，1956年又增至二十万吨。
    我们来到采掘现场，主人把我们引进了一个矿洞。他介绍了各种含磷量不同的矿层。最好的矿层含量达72％，最低的也达50％，质量是很高的。矿层都在地层的表面，开采十分方便。我们先后参观了许多矿洞，最后到了一个较大的矿洞。这个洞已经通到这个矿山的另一端，是工人们用双手经过了十五年的艰苦劳动打通的。
    在这个矿场的陈列室里，陈列着采掘出来的各种实物标本。根据对这些实物标本的考查，这个矿区在四、五千万年以前是一个辽阔的大海，经过长期的地质变化，形成了丰富的磷矿。达弗格卡瓦尔先生一面解释，一面从陈列柜里拿出了许多粗大的动物骨头，其中有各种形状的鱼牙齿。在1945年，这里曾采掘出一具有十二米长的完整的鱼类骨骼。因此，这个磷矿不仅是一个企业，并且是一个有价值的古生物研究所。
    在场长办公室休息的时候，主人谈到了这个矿场的发展前景。根据他们现在制订的初步发展计划，1957年将要生产磷酸钙三十六万吨，比1956年提高产量80％。为了适应1957年产量提高的需要，现在正在进行着各方面的准备工作。
    这个矿的产品销路很广。根据1956年统计，90％的产品供销国外。捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫、印度、意大利等国购买了全年产量的80％。现在其他国家也在要求购买，所成交的货物，已经预订到1957年的产品了。
    向主人告别的时候，我们真诚地祝贺这个矿业得到不断发展。
            死  海
    从约旦的一个城市加力沟向南望去，就能看到一个平静如镜的海面，这就是著名的“死海”。从“死海”这个名字看，好像它是一个毫无用处的海。其实相反，它是约旦的天然财富。
    死海的彼岸是以色列国境。从加力沟到海边约有六公里，修有宽阔的公路相通。为了使游人方便，海滨设有旅馆、咖啡馆和饭馆。
    在死海，看不到像一般海洋所共有的汹涌澎湃的浪涛。我们在那里停留了半小时，没有看到一只白帆，也没有看到一只海鸟飞过。据当地人谈，这里的海水比其它海水都要咸，人失足跌下海去，也会浮起来。
    死海里虽然没有生物，但是从海水里可以提炼出作肥料用的炭酸钾来。这里原来设有一个提炼炭酸钾的工厂。它是英国人、犹太人和阿拉伯人合股经营的，主要是英国人和犹太人的资本。在1948年巴勒斯坦事件发生后，这个厂被毁了。现在约旦政府正计划重新建造一个厂。
          对外贸易
    我们在约旦访问期间，拜会了约旦王国政府的经济大臣，并和工商界人士进行了广泛接触。我们深深地体会到约旦人民迫切要求和中国发展贸易的强烈愿望。约旦经济部长说：“过去约旦受到西方压迫和略侵，我们已经受够了；现在应该从和东方的接触中得到自拔！”在约旦工商界举行的座谈会上，约旦工商界人士纷纷表示要迅速和中国发展贸易，并和我们就开展中约贸易问题交换了意见。他们对中约两国贸易的发展前途具有很大信心。
    经过西方殖民主义长期统治，约旦经济陷于非常落后状态。第二次世界大战以后，约旦虽已获得了独立，但至今英帝国主义在约旦仍有很大的经济势力，阻碍了约旦经济的独立发展。约旦有丰富的磷矿、铁矿和石油资源，都没有得到很好开采。虽然英国对约旦进行了所谓“援助”，可是这种“援助”的结果，使约旦人民受到英国的残酷剥削。
    约旦的农业经济也还不发达，耕种面积仅占整个可耕土地面积的一小部分。现在耕种面积只有九百五十多万都弄（一都弄合一点三六亩），其中只有三十万都弄有水利灌溉，其它都靠天然雨量，粮食不能自给，还须依靠进口。因此，约旦在对外贸易上存在大量入超。从1948年到1955年进出口的总值来看，每年进口约等于出口的十倍。这种严重的入超情况，是帝国主义长期奴役和掠夺的结果，帝国主义也正是利用约旦这种经济状况来实现它们对约旦的经济控制。
    但是，约旦近年来正在发展独立的对外贸易关系，力求摆脱帝国主义的经济束缚。可以看到，随着约旦在政治上的独立，它发展自己独立经济的愿望也一定能够实现。（附图片）
