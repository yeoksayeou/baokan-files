    "Zhou Yu Beats Huang Gai"
    The American magazine "Time" and "Newsweek" simultaneously published a cartoon entitled "A Live Target is More Interesting" on February 4th, along with an article describing Dulles's embarrassing situation under attack in the U.S. Congress. U.S. Congressmen treated Dulles as a live target and launched a concentrated attack on him. They vehemently criticized Dulles's foreign policy as "arbitrary, intimidating, erroneous, and weak," and bluntly expressed their lack of confidence in Dulles. Thus, according to "Newsweek," Dulles was so scolded that "his face turned red and white, and a pencil he was holding quietly slipped from his hand..."
    However, "Newsweek's" cartoon also showed that although the American congressmen's attacks were concentrated on Dulles, they did not hit his vital point, especially deliberately avoiding the "Eisenhower Doctrine," which was actually planned by Dulles. In this way, it is not difficult for people to see what is behind this farce. It turns out that because the foreign policy implemented by Dulles is unpopular everywhere, and the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is criticized everywhere, the American ruling group wants to use the method of attacking Dulles to create an illusion for people, as if the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is blameless, only Dulles is not good. However, this is of no avail. Everyone knows that Dulles originally implemented the colonial and aggressive policies of the American ruling group, and the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is just a continuation and development of this policy.
    The farce created by the American congressmen is a bit like the story of "Zhou Yu Beats Huang Gai" in "Romance of the Three Kingdoms." Zhou Yu beat Huang Gai severely in public, not because Huang Gai was disloyal to Zhou Yu, but only because of the "needs" of the master. (Jin) (Attached picture)

### “周瑜打黄盖”

    “周瑜打黄盖”
    2月4日的美国“时代”周刊和“新闻周刊”同时刊载一幅题为“活靶子更为有趣”的漫画，并配有文章，描写了杜勒斯在美国国会里遭受攻击的狼狈相。美国国会议员们把杜勒斯当作一个活靶子，向他进行了集中的攻击。他们大骂杜勒斯的外交政策是“武断的、恐吓的、错误的和软弱的”，并且直截了当地表示已经对杜勒斯缺乏信心。于是，据“新闻周刊”报道，杜勒斯被骂得“脸上一阵红一阵白，手里拿着的一支铅笔不知什么时候悄悄地从手上滑下来了……。”
    但是，“新闻周刊”的漫画也表示出，美国议员们的攻击虽然集中在杜勒斯的身上，却没有打中他的要害，特别是故意把“艾森豪威尔主义”避开了，而这个“主义”实际上是杜勒斯策划的。这样，人们就不难看出这出闹剧的内幕是什么。原来由于杜勒斯所执行的外交政策到处不得人心，“艾森豪威尔主义”到处挨骂，于是美国统治集团就想用攻击杜勒斯的办法，给人们造成一种错觉，似乎“艾森豪威尔主义”是无可责备的，只是杜勒斯不好。可是，这是无济于事的，谁都知道，本来杜勒斯执行的就是美国统治集团的殖民侵略政策，而“艾森豪威尔主义”不过是这种政策的继续和发展。
    美国议员们所制造的闹剧，有一点像“三国演义”里“周瑜打黄盖”的故事。周瑜把黄盖当众痛打一顿，并不是因为黄盖对周瑜不忠，而只是由于主人的“需要”而已。 （晋）（附图片）
