Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: A conference on the capital's pig production base concluded today, determining that thirteen counties in the Beijing suburbs and Tongxian Prefecture, Hebei Province, would be designated as the capital's pig production base. Within a few years, the base is expected to produce 1.2 million head of fattened pigs annually, with 800,000 head supplied to Beijing and the remaining 400,000 head retained for consumption by residents within the base.

Beijing requires approximately one million head of fattened pigs annually. Last year, 640,000 head were transported from several provinces. In the future, Beijing's pork needs, in addition to being supplied by the surrounding base, will be supplemented by other pig-producing areas to cover any shortfall.

Representatives from Beijing and Hebei Province who attended the meeting believe that farmers in the Beijing suburbs and Tongxian Prefecture have a long-standing habit of raising pigs. If the measures determined at the meeting are followed, such as increasing the source of piglets and feed, appropriately adjusting pig prices, and doing a good job in preventing and controlling pig diseases, it is entirely possible to require the 800,000 farming households within the base to raise two million pigs annually. This year alone, it will be possible to supply Beijing with 200,000 head of fattened pigs.

The head of the Urban Services Department said that cultivating production bases for pigs, vegetables, and other non-staple foods around cities and industrial and mining areas can ensure that the people in cities and industrial and mining areas have a relatively sufficient supply of non-staple foods. Tianjin is preparing to do so, and other cities and industrial and mining areas can emulate this according to their specific circumstances.

　　解决城市猪肉供应的一个新办法
　　通县专区划作首都生猪供应基地
    据新华社23日讯　首都生猪生产基地会议在今天结束，确定把北京市郊区和河北省通县专区的十三个县划为首都的生猪生产基地，在三几年内做到年产肥猪一百二十万头，以八十万头供给北京，其余四十万头留给基地以内的居民食用。
    北京全年约需肥猪一百万头，去年从好几个省调运了六十四万头。将来北京需要的猪肉除由周围基地供应以外，不足的部分将由其他生猪产地补足。
    参加会议的北京市和河北省代表认为，北京郊区和通县专区的农民向来有养猪的习惯，如果按照会议所确定的措施，增加仔猪和饲料来源，适当调整生猪价格，以及做好防治猪的病疫等工作，要求基地内的八十万户农民年养生猪二百万头是完全可能的。今年内就可以供应北京二十万头肥猪。
    城市服务部负责人说，在城市和工矿区周围培养生猪和蔬菜等副食品的生产基地，能够保证城市和工矿区人民得到比较充足的副食品。天津市正在准备这样做，其他城市和工矿区也可以看具体情况仿效。
