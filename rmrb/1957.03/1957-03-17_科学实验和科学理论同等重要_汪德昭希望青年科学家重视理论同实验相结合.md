I am a scientific worker who recently returned to the motherland. This time, I returned to the country to respond to the motherland's call to march towards science, and I am willing to follow in the footsteps of the motherland's scientists and become a sharpshooter on the scientific front.

In the short two months since returning to China, whether in schools, laboratories, or factories, or on the streets, in the markets, or in homes, what I have seen and heard has been too touching and too exciting for me! When I was abroad, I knew from newspapers and friends' conversations that the motherland was engaged in large-scale construction, but I did not expect the construction to be so fast, so good, so comprehensive, and so great! The people's ethos has also fundamentally changed. There are too many examples to cite. Let me take a small incident I encountered at this CPPCC meeting as an example: When I was sitting in the car waiting for another member, I talked to the driver of the car. He offered me a cigarette, and I accepted it with some unease. He noticed it and said, "Comrade Member, please smoke. Although our work is different, our goals are the same!" I was extremely moved! Yes, our goals are the same, and the goals of our 600 million people are the same! We are a true democracy! Our beloved motherland is the People's Republic of China in its true sense!

I am an "old Beijinger." Thinking back to the dilapidated and hellish China of the past, how could it have today's appearance in just a few years? Thinking quietly at night, how can we not sincerely thank our wise government and the great Communist Party!

I would also like to take this opportunity to report to the members that the glory of the motherland not only shines on the land of the country but also shines on every corner of the earth. Overseas Chinese in France now walk with their backs straight and heads held high because of the increasing international status of the motherland! They have always loved the motherland, maintained the glorious revolutionary tradition, and made certain achievements in promoting friendly relations between the Chinese and French people. Whenever a delegation from the motherland arrives, overseas Chinese feel like they have met their relatives. I remember last year's commercial delegation led by Comrade Ji Chaoding, which participated in the Paris Exposition. In order to help take care of our exhibition hall, many merchants voluntarily closed their shops, and many workers voluntarily stopped working. They felt extremely honored to be able to contribute to the motherland. I remember last year's cultural delegation led by Comrades Hou Debang, Mao Yisheng, and Ji Chaoding, which was warmly welcomed by Chinese students in Paris and Lyon.

The motherland's scientific research has also made amazing progress. The scientific workers I have come into contact with are all working with great enthusiasm and intensity. In response to the government's call for thrift, I believe that the motherland's enthusiastic scientists will, on the principle of not hindering research work, automatically make full use of existing equipment and actively design and manufacture scientific instruments that can be made by themselves. Last year, the Chinese Exhibition Hall in Paris displayed some scientific instruments made by the motherland. In order to encourage the creation and imitation of instruments, similar instrument exhibitions may also be held in China.

Scientific journals are the scales for measuring scientific research achievements. The number of our scientific publications is also unimaginable. This symbolizes the spirit of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." In terms of quality, many papers have reached international levels, and some have even exceeded international levels. Some of our published papers have been numbered and analyzed by foreign "citation indexes." The only regret is that the weight of our published theoretical and experimental papers is uneven, and there are not enough articles on experiments. I heard a comrade say at a group discussion that many young scientists now "like theory and are unwilling to work with their hands," and for research topics, they "like the unusual and dislike the ordinary." I think this may be a temporary phenomenon. I believe that young scientific fighters will realize that theory and experiment are of equal importance and are mutually integrated, and that research topics cannot be outstanding without starting from the ordinary. This temporary phenomenon will definitely be reversed.

All scientists who love the motherland, let us strengthen the unity of our ranks, arm our minds, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, strive to form an invincible army and victoriously complete the twelve-year science plan!

### 科学实验和科学理论同等重要  汪德昭希望青年科学家重视理论同实验相结合

    科学实验和科学理论同等重要
    汪德昭希望青年科学家重视理论同实验相结合
    我是一个最近回到祖国的科学工作者。这次回国，是为了响应祖国向科学进军的号召，愿追随着祖国科学家之后，作科学战线上的一名尖兵。
    回到国内短短的两个月，无论是在学校，在实验室，在工厂里，也无论是在街上，在市场，在家庭里，我所看到的，我所听到的，实在使我太感动，太兴奋了！我在国外的时候，从报纸上，从朋友的谈话里，也知道祖国在大规模地建设，但是没有料到的，就是建设的这样的快，这样的好，如此的全面，如此的伟大！人民的风气也根本改变了，例子太多，也不能多举，就拿这次政协开会，我遇到的一件小事来说吧：当我坐在车子上，等候另一位委员的时候，我就和车子的驾驶员谈话，他送过一支纸烟来，我接受了有些不安，被他发觉了，他说：“委员同志，你抽吧，我们的工作虽然不同，但是我们的目标是一致的！”我感动极了！是的，我们的目标是一致的，我们六亿人的目标皆是一致的！我们是真正的民主！我们亲爱的祖国，是名副其实的中华人民共和国！
    我是一个“老北京”，回想一下过去破烂不堪，人间地狱的中国，在短短的几年里，怎么可能有今天的面貌？清夜自思，我们怎能不衷心地感谢我们英明的政府，和伟大的共产党！
    我还愿意借今天的机会，向各位委员报告的，就是祖国的光芒，不仅普照国内大地，它还照着地球上每一个角落。远在法国的华侨，现在因为祖国国际地位的增高，走起路来，也挺起腰板，昂起头来啦！他们一向热爱祖国，保持着光荣的革命传统，而且对促进中法人民友好关系上，也做出了一定的成绩。每遇到祖国代表团的来到，华侨就像见了亲人一样。记得去年以冀朝鼎同志为首的商业代表团，参加了巴黎博览会。为了帮助照料我们的展览馆，许多商胞就自动地将自己的店铺关闭，许多工胞也自动地歇工，他们以能给祖国尽一分力量而感到无比的光荣。记得去年以侯德榜、茅以升、冀朝鼎三位同志为首的文化代表团，也受到了巴黎和里昂的中国留学生热烈的欢迎。
    祖国科学研究方面，也有了惊人的发展。我所接触到的科学工作者，皆抱着极大的热情，紧张地工作着。为了响应政府节约的号召，我相信祖国热情的科学家们，在不妨研究工作进行的原则下，自动地会充分利用原有的设备，积极地设计和制造可以自制的科学仪器。去年巴黎的中国展览馆内，曾陈列了一些祖国自制的科学仪器，为了鼓励仪器的创造及仿造，在国内也不妨举行类似的仪器展览。
    科学杂志，是衡量科学研究成绩的天秤。我们的科学刊物，其种类之多，也是想像不到的。这是象征着“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的精神。在质的方面，很多论文，已达到国际水平，有的甚至超过了国际水平。我们发表的论文，有的已被外国“论文索引”编了号，分析了内容。惟一的遗憾，就是我们发表的理论和实验的论文，分量不匀，实验方面的文章不够多的。前在小组讨论会上听一位同志说，现在的青年科学家，很多人“喜欢理论，不愿动手”，对于研究题目“喜欢特出，不喜平凡”。我想这可能是暂时的现象，我相信青年的科学战士们，一定会了解到理论和实验有同等的重要性，彼此是互相结合的；也会了解到研究的题目不由平凡的着手，就不会有突出。这种暂时的现象，一定会扭转过来的。
    一切热爱祖国的科学家们，加紧地团结我们的队伍，武装起我们的思想，在中国共产党的领导下，为组成一支战无不胜的大军，为胜利地完成十二年科学规划而斗争！
