I would now like to offer some preliminary opinions on the issue of school enrollment for school-age children in rural areas. Because in the vast rural areas of our country, this is not a problem for a few children, but a problem for millions of children. The main purpose of raising this issue is to enable more school-age children in rural areas to have the opportunity to study and to minimize the proportion of out-of-school children.

In the past few years, our country's socialist construction has been advancing rapidly, with the face of the countryside changing completely, especially today after the nationwide agricultural cooperation, the vast majority of farmers have joined cooperatives. For more than a year, countless vivid facts have fully demonstrated the great achievements of China's socialist transformation of agriculture. These achievements are not only reflected in the farmers' victory over severe floods and other natural disasters, but also in the continuous improvement of agricultural production and agricultural technology, and the general improvement of farmers' lives.

However, it must be understood that with the increasing improvement of farmers' lives, their demands for their children to receive education will inevitably become stronger and stronger. This is a good phenomenon that is both desirable and inevitable. Especially in this year of 1957, when the nationwide agricultural effort to achieve a bumper harvest is fully guaranteed, farmers will inevitably be more concerned about their children's education and will place infinite hope on their children's desire to study. If we fail to adequately meet the demands and wishes of the farmers, it will bring them some unpleasant emotions and feelings. What's more, our country is currently vigorously carrying out a literacy campaign nationwide, requiring the basic elimination of illiteracy within twelve years, and therefore has made many efforts in literacy work for young and middle-aged people. Then, for the millions of school-age children in the vast rural areas who are about to go to school, we should try every possible means to maximize the solution by utilizing all available human and material resources. Millions of rural children are the next generation in the countryside, and they are the successors to building socialism and communism. What we rely on to build socialism are people, people with at least a basic level of education and technical skills. If they have no culture or a very low level of culture, it will inevitably affect the speed and progress of our socialist construction to a greater or lesser extent. This is true in factories, mines, and cities, and it is also true in rural areas.

I think that for the issue of school enrollment for school-age children in rural areas this year, if we can actively try every possible means, the problem of schooling for a large number of children in rural areas can be appropriately resolved. My preliminary ideas are as follows:

	1. Tap potential and cultivate teachers:
	According to my understanding, there are still some social figures with considerable cultural levels in rural areas who can take on teaching work, and they can be competent in teaching work. As long as we strengthen their ideological transformation and organize them to study, they can be made to take on rural teaching work. In addition to this, we can also tap teachers from various aspects. In short, the fact that there is some potential for teachers in rural areas can be affirmed.

	2. Run schools arduously and universally promote the two-shift system:
	Regarding this point, it can be divided into three points.

	(1) Currently, schools at all levels across the country are implementing the principle of running schools arduously. Promoting the two-shift system in rural areas is even more suitable for the unique conditions of rural children. For example, students who live far from the school can go to school in the morning, and students who live closer to the school can go to school in the afternoon; older students can go to school in the afternoon, and younger students can go to school in the morning. When it is absolutely necessary, it is also permissible to flexibly adopt temporary measures, appropriately reduce the number of subjects studied, and even appropriately raise the enrollment age according to the actual situation. In this way, schools of the same size can accommodate twice as many school-age children.

	(2) School building problem: In rural areas, it is also possible to find ways to solve it. Temples and ancestral halls that have not yet been occupied, as well as some public places, can be fully utilized. In warm weather seasons, classes can be held outdoors under trees, in forests, and in large courtyards. In this way, more schools or more branch schools can be established to solve the problem of school buildings.

	(3) Equipment problem: In addition to the necessary teaching aids, such as desks and chairs, students can also be mobilized to bring their own desks and chairs, without having to force uniformity and neatness. I think that under the driving force of their urgent desire to go to school, the problem of desks and chairs will not be difficult to solve. Other necessary equipment can also be simplified.

	3. Centralized leadership, separate responsibilities, and everyone work together to run rural schools well:
	In this special situation this year, in rural areas, the issue of running more schools can be required as a political task of agricultural cooperatives, with the local agricultural cooperative responsible for overall leadership and assigning cadres to take on various responsibilities for running schools. The textbooks and workbooks used by students should also be the responsibility of the cooperative to solve. In this way, with centralized leadership and separate responsibilities, schools can be run in a planned and step-by-step manner.

I am a layman in education, and of course my opinions are not concrete enough, comprehensive enough, or perfect enough, but I believe that under the correct leadership of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government, and with the deep concern of the broad masses of farmers, this difficult problem can and will be properly resolved. I sincerely hope that you will conduct further research on this issue and make appropriate resolutions. In this way, there is no doubt that the resolution of the problem will bring immense joy and good news to the millions of school-age children in rural areas waiting to go to school, and needless to say, it will also add a strong reserve force to our construction of socialism.

Whether the above is appropriate, I hope for your corrections and criticisms.

### 尽量增加农村适龄儿童的就学人数  邓哲熙提出三项办法

    尽量增加农村适龄儿童的就学人数
    邓哲熙提出三项办法
    我现在愿意专就农村适龄儿童的就学问题来提供一点粗浅意见。因为在我国的广大农村中，这不是少数儿童的问题，而是千百万儿童的问题。我提出这一问题的主要目的，就是为了使农村中的适龄儿童能够更多地得到求学的机会，能够使失学儿童的比数减少到最小限度。
    几年以来，我国的社会主义建设事业，一日千里，突飞猛晋，全国的农村，整个改变了面貌，尤其在全国农业合作化以后的今天，绝大多数农户，都加入了合作社，一年多来，无数的生动事实，充分地证明了我国农业社会主义改造的巨大成就。这些成就，不仅表现在农民们战胜了严重的水灾和其它自然灾害，而且也表现在农业产量和农业技术的不断提高，农民生活普遍地获得了改善。
    但是必须了解，随着农民生活的日益提高，农民们对于子女接受文化的要求，也必然越来越强烈。这种好现象是应该的而且也是必然的。尤其是在全国农业争取大丰收得到充分保证的今年——1957年，农民们对于子女的求学问题，必然会更加关怀，对于子女求学的意愿也更会寄予无限的希望。如果我们对农民们这一要求和愿望，不能适当地予以满足，那么，就会给他们带来一些不愉快的情绪和感觉。何况，目前我们国家正在全国范围内大力开展扫盲运动，要求在十二年内基本上消灭文盲，因此，对青壮年老年扫盲工作作了许多的努力。那么，我们对广大农村中的千百万将要就学的适龄儿童，更应当想尽一切办法，利用一切可能利用的人力物力，求得最大限度的解决。千百万的农村儿童，他们是农村中的下一代，他们是建设社会主义共产主义的接班人，我们建设社会主义，所靠的是人，是具有起码文化水平和技术水平的人，如果他们没有文化或文化很低，必然会在或大或小的程度上影响我们建设社会主义的速度和进展，在工厂是如此，在矿山也是如此，在城市是如此，在农村也何尝不如此。
    我想，对于今年农村适龄儿童就学问题，如果能够积极地想尽一切办法，农村中大量儿童的求学问题，是可以适当地获得解决的。我初步的意见是这样：
   1、挖掘潜力，培养师资：
    据我了解，在农村里还有一些具有相当文化水平的社会人士是可以担任教学工作的，而且他们在教学工作上是可以胜任的，只要加强对他们的思想改造，组织他们进行学习，便可以使他们担任农村教学工作。除此以外，还可以从多方面挖掘师资。总之，在农村中存在着师资部分潜力，这一事实，是可以肯定的。
    2、艰苦办学，普遍推行二部制：
    关于这一条，可以分三点来说。
    （1）当前我国全国各地各级学校，都在执行艰苦办学这一原则。在农村里推行二部制，更是适合农村儿童的特有条件。例如：离学校较远的学生，可以在午前上学，离学校较近的学生，就可以在午后上学；年龄较大的学生可以午后上学，年龄较小的学生可以在午前上学。必不得已的时候，也未尝不可以灵活地采取临时措施，适当减少学习科目，甚至于酌量实际情况，适当地提高入学年龄。这样，同样大小的学校，就可以容纳多一倍的学龄儿童。
    （2）校舍问题：在农村中也可以设法解决，对于尚未占用的庙宇和祠堂，以及一些公共处所，都可以充分地加以利用。天气暖和的季节，大树下、树林里、大院里露天上课都可以。这样，就可以增设更多的学校或者更多地设立分校，解决了校舍的问题。
    （3）设备问题：除了必要的教具以外，如桌凳等问题，也可以动员学生自带桌凳，不必强求划一整齐。我想，在他们迫切要求上学的动力下，桌凳问题，不难解决。其他必要设备，也可以因陋就简。
    3、集中领导，分别负责，大家努力办好农村学校：
    在今年的特殊情况下，在农村里可以把多办学校的问题，作为农业合作社的一个政治任务来要求，由当地农业合作社负责总领导，指派干部分别兼负办学的各项职责。学生所用的课本和作业本，也要由合作社负责解决。这样，集中领导，分别负责，就可以有计划有步骤地办好学校。
    我对于教育是一个门外汉，当然我的意见，还不够具体，还不够全面而完善，但是我相信在共产党、毛主席和人民政府的正确领导和广大农民的深切关怀下，这一困难问题，是可以而且一定能够获得适当解决的。我衷心地希望各位能够就这一问题，用更进一步的研究，作出恰当的决议，这样，毫无疑问，问题的解决，会给农村中的千百万等待就学的适龄儿童带来莫大的喜悦和福音，不用说，对我们的建设社会主义，也会多增加一支有力的后备军。
    以上所谈，是否妥当，尚祈指正批评。
