Premier Široký's Speech

Respected Comrade Premier of the State Council! Dear comrades and friends!

We are pleased and excited to have set foot on the soil of the People's Republic of China, a country with which our two nations are linked by strong friendship and fraternal affection. We consider it a great honor to have received the invitation from the government of the People's Republic of China to visit your great nation, renowned for its millennia of culture, the brave and intelligent people, and the people's outstanding revolutionary traditions. Please allow me, on behalf of the government delegation, to express our heartfelt gratitude for this invitation, and to convey the sincere greetings of the Czechoslovak people to you and to all the Chinese people.

We are visiting your country at a time when the Chinese people, inspired by the extremely important results of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, have successfully begun the heroic struggle to transform their country into an industrially developed socialist nation. Our people, along with the people of other countries, are watching with pleasure and admiration this immense effort of more than six hundred million people, watching their inexhaustible energy in building a new social system and building a glorious and happy future for China.

We are visiting your country at a time when peace-loving people of all countries have defeated the attempts by international imperialist forces to turn back the wheels of history. The imperialist forces have neither been able to stop the historical liberation movement of the Asian and African peoples, nor have they been able to undermine or weaken the unity of the great socialist camp led by our common friend, the Soviet Union. Their attempts to drag humanity into a new world war have gone bankrupt. The forces of peace, socialism, and freedom are making new and great efforts to defend peace, to strive for friendship among the people of all countries, and to achieve new victories in the cause of progress and national independence. Our visit is symbolic in a sense. We, the representatives of a country that has become the western bulwark of the socialist camp, have come to the People's Republic of China, the eastern bulwark of the great socialist camp, for a fraternal visit. Our visit is a manifestation of the unity of the socialist camp, which has been, is, and will continue to be the main and strongest bulwark of peace and the security of the people of all countries in the world, and the pillar and strength of the Asian and African countries struggling for national independence and against imperialist oppression. We firmly believe that our visit will surely make a new contribution to the further growth of the strength and might of the socialist camp and a great contribution to the cause of world peace.

Solid fraternal relations of mutual cooperation have been established between the People's Republic of China and the Czechoslovak Republic, based on complete equality, mutual respect, and adherence to each other's interests, guided by the immortal ideas of proletarian internationalism. We deeply cherish this friendship with the great Chinese people and are proud of it. The experience of our cooperation in various aspects of economic, cultural, and political life undeniably creates favorable preconditions for the future great development of this cooperation, which is fully in line with the interests of socialist construction in our two countries and the interests of the entire socialist camp.

Dear friends, we have come to your country to become familiar with your beautiful and rich nation, to understand more intimately your wise and talented people, to utilize the inexhaustible treasures of your revolutionary and cultural traditions, and to absorb your rich and valuable experience in socialist construction. As the saying goes, a good friend is the most valuable treasure. We are honored to be able to regard the great People's Republic of China as our close and intimate friend, and we can also learn from your rich experience and achievements, which can be used to build socialism in our country more smoothly.

Dear Chinese friends! We are heartily pleased to be in contact and hold talks with you!

Long live the glorious People's Republic of China and the heroic Chinese people!

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak people!

May the solidarity and unbreakable unity of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union grow stronger day by day!

专栏：

    西罗基总理的讲话敬爱的国务院总理同志！亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    我们愉快而激动地踏上了中华人民共和国的国土，我们两国是由牢固的友谊和兄弟友爱感情联系在一起的。我们认为，我们接到中华人民共和国政府的邀请来访问你们这个以数千年文化、勇敢智慧的人民和人民的卓越革命传统而闻名的伟大国家，这是自己的莫大的光荣。请允许我代表政府代表团对这次邀请向你们表示衷心感谢，同时向你们和全中国人民转达捷克斯洛伐克人民的诚挚问候。
    我们访问贵国的时候，正是中国人民受到中国共产党第八次代表大会的极重要结果的鼓舞，成功地开始了把自己的国家变成工业发达的社会主义国家的英勇斗争的时候。我国人民和其他各国人民都在以愉快而钦佩的心情注视着六亿多人的这种巨大努力，注视着他们建设新社会制度、建设中国的光荣和幸福的未来的那种充沛无比的精力。
    我们访问贵国的时候，正是爱好和平的各国人民击败了国际帝国主义势力想使历史车轮倒转的企图的时候。帝国主义势力既没有能制止亚非人民的历史性的解放运动，也没有能破坏或削弱以我们的共同朋友——苏联为首的伟大社会主义阵营各国的团结。他们想把人类拖入新世界大战的试图破产了。和平、社会主义和自由的力量正在作新的巨大努力，正在保卫和平和争取各国人民友好、争取在进步和民族独立事业中取得新胜利。我们的访问在某种意义上是有象征意义的。我们，一个成为社会主义阵营西方堡垒的国家的代表，来到了伟大的社会主义阵营的东方堡垒——中华人民共和国进行兄弟的访问。我们的访问是社会主义阵营团结一致的表现，社会主义阵营过去是、今后仍将是和平和世界各国人民安全的主要的和最强大的堡垒，是为争取民族独立、反对帝国主义压迫而斗争的亚非各国人民的支柱和力量。我们坚信，我们的访问一定会对社会主义阵营的力量和威力的进一步增长作出新贡献，对世界和平事业作出巨大贡献。
    中华人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国之间建立起了以完全平等、互相尊重和遵守对方利益为基础、以不朽的无产阶级国际主义思想为指针的相互合作的巩固兄弟关系。我们非常珍视同伟大中国人民的这种友谊，并且因这种友谊而感到自豪。我们在经济、文化和政治生活各方面实行合作的经验无可争辩地为今后大大发展这种合作创造了良好的前提，这是完全符合我们两国社会主义建设的利益，符合整个社会主义阵营的利益的。
    亲爱的朋友们，我们到贵国来是为了熟悉你们这个美好富饶的国家，为了更亲切地了解贵国智慧天才的人民，利用你们的革命和文化传统的无穷宝藏，吸取你们社会主义建设的丰富和宝贵的经验。俗话说得好，好朋友是最宝贵的财富。我们很荣幸我们可以把伟大的中华人民共和国作为自己亲近的密友，我们还可以学习贵国丰富的经验和成就，用来更顺利地在我国建设社会主义。
    亲爱的中国朋友们！我们由于将同你们进行接触和会谈而感到衷心的愉快！
    光荣的中华人民共和国和英雄的中国人民万岁！
    中捷两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    愿以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的团结和牢不可破的一致日益加强！
