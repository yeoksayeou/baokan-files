Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok: The Thai government announced on the 2nd that the entire country was under a state of emergency. The government explained that this measure was taken because "opposition parties were causing unrest" after the Thai parliamentary elections on February 26th.

According to the emergency decree signed by Thai Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram, gatherings of more than five people and any criticism of the election results are prohibited. According to Thai radio announcements, Thai Army Commander-in-Chief Sarit Thanarat has taken over the command of the army, navy, air force, and police forces.

The final results of the Thai parliamentary elections have not yet been announced. According to a report today from the Kyodo News Agency correspondent in Bangkok, the results of 158 of the 160 seats for first-category parliamentarians contested in the election by various Thai political parties have been tallied. The ruling Seri Manangkasila Party won 80 seats. In the previous parliament, the Seri Manangkasila Party held 100 of the 123 first-category seats.

In this election, the ruling party has faced accusations from various parties. Sources say that the main right-wing opposition Democratic Party has accused the election of being fraudulent, and that "pro-government thugs harassed and threatened opposition candidates during the campaign."

On the evening of March 2nd, more than 50,000 people held a march and demonstration in Bangkok. The demonstration marched to the Government House and presented a petition to Thai Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Phibunsongkhram, making the following demands: immediately lift the state of emergency, declare the February 26th election invalid, hold new elections, send university students to supervise the vote counting in the new elections, and punish officials responsible for dereliction of duty in electoral affairs and those who interfered with voting.

Tanks are stationed at the major intersections in Bangkok, and the army and police forces are also in a state of "full alert."

    抗议銮披汶政府宣布紧急状态
    曼谷五万多人游行示威
    据新华社讯  曼谷消息：泰国政府2日宣布全国处于紧急状态。政府解释采取这一措施的原因说，2月26日泰国举行议会选举以后，“反对党有不安情况”。
    根据泰国总理銮披汶签署的紧急条例，五人以上的集会以及对选举结果的任何批评都在被禁止之列。据泰国电台宣布，泰国陆军总司令乃沙立已经接管了统率海、陆、空三军和警察部队的权力。
    泰国这次议会选举的最后结果还没有公布。据日本共同社驻曼谷记者今天报道，泰国各政党在这次选举中竞选的第一类议员的一百六十个席位中，一百五十八个席位的结果已经统计完毕。执政的马兰卡西拉自由党获得了八十个席位。而上届议会的第一类议员的一百二十三个席位中，马兰卡西拉自由党占有一百个席位。
    在这次选举中，执政党遭到了各方面的指责。有消息说，主要的右翼反对党民主党指责在这次选举中有舞弊行为，同时“亲政府的恶棍在竞选中责难和威胁反对党的候选人”。
    3月2日晚间，曼谷有五万多人举行游行示威，示威队伍游行到政府大厦前，给泰国总理兼内政部长銮披汶递送了一项请愿书，提出了下列要求：立即解除紧急状态，宣布2月26日的选举无效，举行新的选举，在新的选举中派大学生监督点票工作，以及惩办负责选举事务的失职官员和干预投票的人员。
    曼谷的各主要街道口上都驻有坦克，军队和警察部队也处在“充分戒备状态”中。
