Farmers in Many Areas of Sichuan and Guangdong
Strive to Protect Seedlings

    (Our dispatch) The sowing work for approximately one million mu of early rice paddy fields in Sichuan Province has basically concluded. This year, the province will cultivate 12 million mu of double-cropping rice, an increase of 267% compared to last year. To ensure the timely transplanting of early rice, various localities have strengthened guidance on early rice seedling cultivation. Currently, seedlings in many areas are already two to three inches tall. In the Nanchong Special District, counties have extensively carried out technical instruction, planning paddy fields plot by plot, ensuring that large fields are used for field-based seedling cultivation and small fields are used for sectional seedling cultivation. To strengthen paddy field management, more than 3,000 agricultural cooperatives in Renshou County have universally implemented a responsibility system for paddy field management, electing experienced farmers to manage the paddy fields and installing windbreaks and smoke-based frost prevention equipment around the paddy fields.
    Another dispatch: Farmers in Guangdong Province are currently engaged in a struggle against adverse weather, concentrating their efforts on nurturing seedlings in over 2 million mu of paddy fields.
    Since the Beginning of Spring, most areas of the province have experienced continuous rainfall. In the mountainous areas of northern Guangdong, rainfall in the past month has almost accounted for one-third of the average annual rainfall, causing some seedlings to wither and weaken. Farmers in various localities are now braving the rain to dig drainage ditches, build racks and sheds over paddy fields, and spread wood ash to protect seedlings from the cold and keep them warm. Farmers in the Han River Plain and along the East River are also applying fast-acting fertilizers one or two times in advance to quickly revive the seedlings and make them strong again. In the Pearl River Delta, known as the "Granary of Guangdong," advanced methods such as staggered sowing and dry sowing for seedling cultivation are widely adopted to resist frost damage. Counties like Xinhui and Zhongshan have established seedling management committees in each township and seedling protection groups in each cooperative, with designated personnel in each production team responsible for managing paddy fields, greatly reducing the phenomenon of seedling rot. Seedlings in most areas have grown to three or four inches tall, are lush and green, and transplanting can begin around the Qingming Festival.

　　四川广东许多地区的农民
　　想方设法保护秧苗成长
    本报讯　四川省约一百万亩早稻秧田播种工作基本结束。全省今年种植双季稻一千二百万亩，比去年增大267％。为使早稻按期栽插，各地加强了早稻育苗指导，现在，许多地区的秧苗已有两三寸高。南充专区各县广泛开展技术传授工作，对秧田逐田逐块进行了规划，做到了大田随田育秧，小田分片育秧。仁寿县三千多农业社为加强秧田管理工作，普遍推行了秧田管理责任制，选举经验丰富的农民管理秧田，在秧田周围作了挡风笆子和熏烟防冻的设备。
    又讯　广东省农民正在同恶劣天气展开斗争，集中力量在二百多万亩秧田上做好培育秧苗的工作。
    立春以来，这省大多数地区阴雨连绵。粤北山区一个多月来的下雨量，几乎占常年雨量的三分之一，以致有些秧苗萎黄，生势很弱。各地农民现正冒雨开挖排水沟，在秧田上搭架筑棚，撒施草木灰，为秧苗防寒保暖。韩江平原和东江沿岸农民，还提早增施一、二次速效肥料，让秧苗很快地回青转壮。称为“广东粮仓”的珠江三角洲各地普遍采取分批播种、旱播育秧等先进方法，以抗御冻害。新会、中山等县在每个乡中设立了秧苗管理委员会，在每个社中建立护秧小组，每个生产队中指定专人负责管理秧田，烂秧现象大为减少。大部分地区的秧苗已生长到三、四寸高，青绿可爱，“清明”前后即可开始插秧。
