A Solution to Urban Overcrowding

    Zeng Zhenwu suggests the government reward retired cadres, intellectuals, and workers to return to rural areas voluntarily and if possible. This benefits all aspects.
    Today, I would like to offer some immature opinions on the issue of curbing excessive urban population congestion:
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, due to the rapid development of politics, economy, and culture, the urban population has surged, forming a sea of people. The majority of these people come from rural areas, and their families have also followed, becoming urban residents. However, there are few opportunities for the urban population to flow back to rural areas. This situation is continuing to develop. If this continues for a long time, the urban population will become even more crowded, not only putting excessive burdens on housing, supply, culture, and education, making them impossible to solve, but also creating a major problem for the employment of the next generation.
    On the other hand, because farmers have low incomes and a difficult life, ordinary manual laborers in cities generally earn more and live better than they do, making them feel inferior. Compared to ordinary cadres and technical workers, they feel even further behind. Therefore, they have a mental burden and are not content with agricultural production. Among the cadres, intellectuals, and workers who have flowed into cities, some have brought their entire families, reducing their relationship with their hometowns and naturally becoming indifferent or even severing their ties. Some farmers feel that these people are too uncaring about their hometowns, forgetting their ancestors and their roots. At the same time, the children of these cadres, intellectuals, and workers, because they have lived in the city for a long time or have grown up entirely in the city, do not understand the lives of farmers and do not know the hardship of farming, giving rise to the erroneous mentality of looking down on agricultural labor. All of this will create a distance in thought and feeling between the people of urban and rural areas.
    Therefore, I suggest that the government establish a system, prepare conditions, and reward retired cadres, intellectuals, and workers to return to rural areas or their hometown counties and cities as much as possible, based on the principles of voluntariness and the permission of conditions. This has the following benefits: 1. It can slow down the rate of urban population surge, thereby reducing the difficulties in housing, supply, culture, and education in cities. 2. Although these retired returnees are old and frail and cannot engage in labor production, they all have considerable work experience and knowledge, and they can play some role in helping and guiding general rural affairs; at the same time, family members who have labor power can also participate in agricultural production. 3. Due to the exchange of urban and rural populations, the feelings of urban and rural people will be closer, the ideological distance will be greatly reduced or completely eliminated, and it will also play a certain role in strengthening the alliance of workers, farmers, and intellectuals. 4. The air in the countryside is fresh, and the hustle and bustle of the city is too much. Retired elderly people who leave the city and go to the countryside to enjoy their years and appreciate the pleasures of rural life will have a more pleasant life and healthier bodies, thereby extending their life span.
    However, in the current situation, there are still many difficulties to be overcome. What are some of the difficulties? 1. Agricultural cooperativization has only been around for a little over a year or two. Although farmers' lives have improved somewhat compared to the past, they have not fundamentally escaped poverty and backwardness. People who are used to living in the city will feel that rural life is too hard and be daunted. 2. Rural education, medicine, transportation, and other conditions are too poor to meet the needs of the retired returnees. 3. There are few houses in rural areas, and retired people who suddenly return home may have no place to live. 4. Retired people and their families, because they have lived in the city for a long time, cannot change their lifestyles all at once, and because they have severed ties with their hometowns for many years, their feelings have not been established, and they fear being discriminated against in rural areas.
    The above are all practical difficulties and possible situations. Can they be solved? Yes, they can be solved. 1. Due to the consolidation of agricultural cooperativization and the improvement of production technology and productivity, farmers' incomes will increase year by year, and their lives will improve year by year. Rural education, health, transportation, and other conditions will naturally develop day by day. It is expected that by the time the Second Five-Year Plan is completed, the face of the countryside will be completely changed, and the gap between urban and rural areas will gradually narrow. The worry that rural life is too hard will basically disappear. Therefore, whether to return home early or late can be decided according to the specific circumstances of each place and each person. Those with good conditions can be mobilized to return home first, and those with poor conditions can be mobilized to return home later. 2. The housing problem should be solved by the local government allocating the necessary houses in a unified way, or by building them independently, with government subsidies and local assistance. However, whatever the solution, preparations must be made early, as temporary arrangements are difficult. 3. The system of retired personnel returning home is a national policy. As long as the returnees themselves pay attention to uniting the farmers in their lives and work styles, establish feelings, and create a good living environment, the farmers will not only welcome these people back home, but also give them great help, and there will never be discrimination or confrontation.
    Based on the above situation, although there are many specific difficulties to be solved in rewarding retired personnel to return home, and it takes some time to prepare the conditions, and a complete system is needed, and it is impossible to implement it universally in a short period of time or like a gust of wind, it can be regarded as a major direction for solving the problem of urban population congestion. On the other hand, implementing a vacation system for on-the-job cadres and workers, so that everyone has the opportunity to return to their hometown once a year to reunite with their families, to prevent their families from flocking to the city, is also a major way to reduce the inflow of rural population into the city. If it is carried out in conjunction with the system of rewarding retired personnel to return home, it will have practical effects in curbing the surge in urban population.
    Please consider whether the above views are appropriate.

    解决城市人口拥挤的一个办法
    曾震五建议政府奖励退休的干部、知识分子、工人在自愿和可能条件下，尽量回到农村居住。这对各方面都有好处。
    我今天想对节制城市人口过度拥挤的问题，提出点不成熟的意见：
    中华人民共和国成立以来，由于政治、经济、文化的飞速发展，城市人口激增，汇为人海。其中多数均来自农村，家属也跟来了，成为城市居民。而城市人口，很少有机会流向农村。这种情况，正在继续发展着。长此以往，城市人口将更加拥挤，不仅居住、供应、文教等方面负担过重，无法解决，后一辈的就业，亦将大成问题。
    另一方面，由于农民的收入少，生活苦，一般在城市从事普通的体力劳动的工人，比他们的收入还多，生活还好，就感觉自己相形见绌。比起一般干部和技术工人，则更膛乎其后。因此在思想上便有了负担，不安心农业生产。而流入城市人口中的干部、知识分子、工人，有的全家都出来了，和家乡的关系少了，对家乡的关怀，自然也就冷淡甚至断绝了。有些农民便觉得这些人太不关心家乡，忘了祖先，忘了本。同时这些干部、知识分子、工人的子女，因为居留城市日久，或者完全生长在城市，体会不到农民的生活，不知稼穑之艰难，滋生轻视农业劳动的错误心理。由此种种，便会造成城乡间人民思想上和感情上的距离。
    因此，我建议政府，订立制度，准备条件，奖励退休的干部、知识分子、工人，在自愿的原则下和条件的许可下，尽量回到农村或故乡的县市居住。这样有下列好处：1、可降低城市人口激增的速度，从而减少城市在居住、供应、文教等方面的困难。2、这些退休回乡的人员，虽然年老力衰，不能从事劳动生产，但均有相当的工作经验和知识，在一般农村事务中，会起一些帮助、指导的作用；同时其家属中有劳动力的，还可参加农业生产。3、由于城市农村人口的交流，城乡人民的情感将更加密切，思想上的距离将大大缩小或者完全消除，对工人、农民、知识分子联盟的加强也将起一定作用。4、农村空气清新，城市繁嚣太甚，退休的年老人，离开城市到农村中去优游岁月，欣赏田园之乐，生活将会更加愉快，身体将会更加健康，从而延长其年寿。
    但是在目前的情况下，还存在许多困难待克服。有些什么困难呢？1、农业合作化还只一年多或两年，农民生活，虽然较过去提高了一些，基本上还未脱离贫困落后状况，在城市生活惯的人，会感觉乡村生活太苦，望而生畏。2、农村教育、医药、交通等条件太差，不能满足退休回乡人口的需求。3、农村房屋少，退休的人骤然回乡，可能没有住处。4、退休的人及其家属，由于居留城市较久，生活一时还变不过来，又因多年和故乡断绝了联系，情感未建立，怕在农村中受歧视。
    以上这些，都是实际的困难和可能发生的情况。是不是能解决呢？肯定的说，可以解决。1、由于农业合作化的巩固，生产技术和生产率的提高，农民收入逐年增加，生活逐年改善，农村教育、卫生、交通等条件，自然也会一天天发展的。预计在第二个五年计划将完成的时候，农村的面貌，将完全改观，城乡的差别也逐渐缩小了，所谓农村生活太苦的顾虑，基本上不会存在。因此早回乡、迟回乡，可以按照各地各人的具体情况来决定。条件好的先动员回乡，条件差的迟动员回乡。2、居住问题，由当地统筹拨给必需的房屋，或者自力筹建、政府补贴、地方帮助。但怎样解决，均得早先准备，临时安排是困难的。3、退休人员回乡制度，系国家政策，只要还乡人员自己在生活上、作风上注意团结农民，建立情感，创造良好的生活环境，农民不仅会欢迎这些人回乡，而且会给以大力帮助，绝不至有歧视对立的情绪。
    根据以上的情况来说，奖励退休人员还乡回家，虽然有许多具体困难的问题待解决，需要有些时间去准备条件，还需有一套完备的制度，不可能在短时间内和一阵风一样可以普遍实施的，但是可以看成是解决城市人口拥挤问题一个主要方向。另一方面。实行在职干部、工人的休假制度，使各人均有机会一年一度回到故乡和家人团叙，免得他们的家属涌向城市来，这也是减少农村人口流入城市的一个主要方法。如果和奖励退休人员还乡的制度相辅而行，在制止城市人口激增的问题上，是会有实际效果的。
    以上所见，是否有当，请考虑。
