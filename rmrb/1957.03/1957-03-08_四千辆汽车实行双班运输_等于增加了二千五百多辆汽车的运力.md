    Four Thousand Vehicles Implement Double-Shift Transport
    Equaling an Increase of More Than Two Thousand Five Hundred Vehicles in Transport Capacity
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Twenty-two units in the highway transportation system have been piloting double-shift transportation, with good results. After 134 vehicles in Guangxi Province participated in double-shift transportation, transport efficiency increased by 70% compared to single-shift transportation, equivalent to an increase in the transport capacity of 90 vehicles. In Yunnan Province, the partial implementation of double-shift transportation also equated to an additional 140-plus vehicles per month.
    To cooperate with double-shift transportation, highway transportation departments in various regions have taken many measures. Highway transportation departments in Guangxi, Gansu, Shandong, Hebei and other places, along with material departments and dock workers, rationally arranged loading, unloading, and ferry times, ensuring that vehicles could be ferried, loaded, and unloaded at any time upon arrival. They also appropriately assigned skilled workers to drive night shifts, based on the driver's technical skills and health, to ensure driving safety. Gansu organized maintenance workers to establish a workshop for reviving old materials, repairing parts unavailable in the market, to support the normal operation of double-shift vehicles. Stations in Shanghai, Xinxiang, Lanzhou, Gaomi, and other places paid close attention to the diet and sleep of drivers, ensuring hot meals and fresh vegetables every night, and arranging appropriate resting places for drivers. Restrooms with recreational items, newspapers, and books were provided at driver shift change locations. Due to the implementation of double-shift transportation, there was a perceived shortage of drivers, and many places trained new drivers.
    After the implementation of double-shift transportation, the phenomenon of working overtime was gradually reduced, and employees actively participated in double-shift transportation. Currently, the number of vehicles implementing double-shift transportation has reached approximately four thousand, with transport efficiency generally increasing by 60% to 70% compared to single-shift transportation, equivalent to a national increase of more than two thousand five hundred vehicles in transport capacity.

    四千辆汽车实行双班运输
    等于增加了二千五百多辆汽车的运力
    新华社讯　公路运输系统有二十二个单位试行双班运输，收到良好效果。广西省一百三十四辆汽车参加双班运输以后，运输效率比单班运输提高70％，相当于增加了九十辆汽车的运力。云南省部分车辆试行双班运输，每月也相当于增加一百四十多辆汽车。
    为了配合双班运输，各地公路运输部门都采取了许多措施。广西、甘肃、山东、河北等地公路运输部门同物资部门、渡口工人合理安排装卸货物和过渡时间，做到车到随时过渡，随装随卸，并且根据驾驶员的技术和健康情况，适当规定技术熟练的工人夜班驾驶，以保证行车安全。甘肃组织保修工人成立旧料复活车间，修复市场买不到的零件，配合了双班车的正常运行。上海、新乡、兰州、高密等车站，十分注意驾驶工人的饮食和睡眠，做到每晚都有热饭和新鲜菜蔬，安排驾驶员适当的休息地方，驾驶员交接班地点设立休息室并备有文娱用品、书报等。由于实行双班运输，驾驶员感到不足，许多地方都培养了新的驾驶员。
    实行双班运输以后，加班加点的现象逐步减少了，职工们都积极参加双班运输。现在实行双班运输的汽车已经达到四千辆左右，运输效率一般的比单班运输提高60％到70％，等于全国增加了二千五百多辆汽车的运力。
