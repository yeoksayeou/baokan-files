Editorial: Thoroughly Inspect Spring Planting Preparations

The spring plowing season has already begun in the southern regions, and it will soon begin in the northern regions. How well the spring plowing preparations have been made in areas where spring plowing has not yet begun is a matter that the relevant departments and party and government leading organs in various localities must pay close attention to. This is because only with good preparations can we ensure timely spring plowing, ensure the quality of cultivation, and lay the foundation for a bumper harvest this year.

Last year, some places, due to lack of experience, one-sidedly emphasized early sowing, resulting in sowing too early and being affected by low temperatures. In addition, some places, due to insufficient preparation, had rough cultivation and missed the farming season. These all affected crop growth and harvest. This year, the conditions are much better than last year. The whole country's rural areas have basically achieved advanced cooperativization, a large number of cadres have been transferred to the grassroots to strengthen leadership, and most agricultural cooperatives have experience in material reserves and business management. However, judging from the current situation, there are still many problems. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, many areas have insufficient material preparations; the quality of accumulated fertilizer is slightly better than last year, but the quantity is far from sufficient, and some places are less than half of the required amount; seeds are generally retained, but due to improper storage, there are phenomena of mildew and insect damage, and the varieties are incomplete; farmland water conservancy projects have not been completed as planned in many places; and in some areas, the condition of draft animals being thin and dying is serious, and there is a shortage of animal power. This situation is more serious in areas that suffered disasters last year or had a poor foundation, but it is not completely absent in general areas. For example, in Hubei Province, which had a bumper harvest last year, some people thought long ago that everything was "ready," but after inspection, by mid-February, only 30%-40% of the province's small and medium-sized farmland water conservancy projects had been completed, and the fertilizer accumulation plan in advanced areas was only 70% completed. If we only look at the average figures or the better parts of the situation, it will numb the thinking of the leadership and delay major events. According to the inspection in Yuci County, Shanxi Province, thirty-six agricultural cooperatives, including Shuguang, have completed the fertilizer accumulation plan and sent one-fourth of it to the fields; while forty-four agricultural cooperatives, including Donghougou, have only completed one-third of the plan. Therefore, a comprehensive inspection of spring plowing preparations is very necessary.

The inspection of spring plowing preparations is not only to check the preparation of production materials such as seeds, draft animals, and farm tools, but also to check the production plan and labor organization. Whether the material resources are sufficient has a great impact on spring plowing production. But even if the material preparations are good, if the labor organization and deployment are not good, and there is chaos at the time, it will also hinder spring plowing production. The production plan is the goal of struggle and a specific deployment. If it is set too low, it will reduce the role of promoting production forward; if it is set too high, and there is no possibility of realization, it will also make the masses lose confidence. Therefore, we must carefully check whether the plan is active and reliable. Last year, some places increased the plan from top to bottom, layer by layer, resulting in a plan that was too high. This year, generally speaking, the plans made by agricultural cooperatives in various places are more practical than last year, but it has also been found that some agricultural cooperatives have a tendency to reduce the plan layer by layer because they are afraid of making subjectivist errors again. This is a problem worth noting. In terms of technological transformation, many places blindly adopted new technologies last year without considering the specific conditions, which has been corrected this year. But some places have the wrong idea of negating technological transformation altogether, which also needs to be corrected. The preparation for technological transformation should also be thoroughly inspected. For example, if there is no full preparation for expanding the area of multiple cropping, it is inevitable to repeat the shortcomings that occurred last year.

While inspecting spring plowing preparations, we must also check the field management of wheat and other summer-ripening crops, quickly replenish fertilizer where there is a shortage, and irrigate in time where there is drought, in order to strive for a bumper harvest of wheat and other summer-ripening crops.

The purpose of inspection is to solve problems, so if problems are found, effective measures should be taken to solve them quickly. Some places found that draft animals were thin and there was a shortage of animal power, so they immediately strengthened feeding management, appropriately increased feed, and organized manpower to deliver manure to make up for the lack of animal power. This has achieved the effect of promoting work. If the inspection and problem-solving are divided into two stages, and the problems are solved after the inspection is completed, it will be too late.

Some places may find many problems at once, but it is impossible to solve them all at once. It is necessary to prioritize the problems, distinguishing between the important and the urgent, solving the problems that have a greater impact on spring plowing production first, and solving the problems that have a smaller impact later. As for the work of merging cooperatives, transferring cooperatives, and handling final accounts and distributions, some can be stopped and done after the wheat harvest or autumn harvest, and some can be handled in conjunction with production. In short, we must shift the focus of work to spring plowing production, and we cannot get entangled in any problem we encounter, nor can we hope to solve all problems completely at once.

The inspection of spring plowing preparations should not be simply to check shortcomings and find faults, but to discover problems and find solutions. Not only should we inspect weak links and areas where work is poor, but also areas where work is good, summarize and improve good experiences and good methods, promote them, and use the advanced to drive the backward, promoting the overall work.

In order to make the inspection work effective, in addition to sending cadres from top to bottom to conduct in-depth inspections, it is more important to mobilize the masses to conduct inspections from bottom to top, turning the inspection process into a process of conscious activities and self-education for the masses. The good opinions of the masses on last year's work and the good suggestions for striving for a bumper agricultural harvest this year should be carefully collected, studied, and used to rapidly improve all aspects of work and quickly improve the leadership level. Units that have done a good job in spring plowing preparations should be praised and encouraged by the masses, and those that have not done well should be criticized and educated. Through such inspections, the sense of responsibility of the members for the collective cause can be strengthened, and their enthusiasm for production can be greatly improved.

This year, in preparing for spring plowing, we must not only give full play to the enthusiasm of young and middle-aged farmers, but also give full play to the role of experienced farmers. Everything that requires the action of the broad masses of farmers should be discussed with the masses, and the opinions of experienced farmers should be widely listened to. Things that most experienced farmers do not agree with should generally not be done rashly or reluctantly.

### 深入检查备耕工作

    深入检查备耕工作
    现在南方地区春耕活动已经开始，北方地区也就要开始。在还未开始春耕的地区，春耕准备工作究竟做得怎样，是各地主管部门和党政领导机关都必须密切注意的问题。因为只有做好了准备，才能保证适时春耕，并且保证耕作质量，打下今年大丰收的基础。
    去年有些地方由于经验不足，片面强调提前下种，结果提得过早，受了低温影响。另外有些地方由于准备工作做得不够，耕作粗放，又误了农时。这些都影响了作物的生长和收成。今年条件比去年要好得多。全国农村已经基本上实现了高级合作化，大批干部调到下面去，加强了基层的领导，大部地区农业社有了物资储备和经营管理的经验。但是从现在的情况看，问题也还不少。据农业部了解，很多地区物质资料准备不足；积肥的质量比去年稍好，但数量却相差很远，有的地方还不到需要量的一半；种子一般都留了，但由于保管不善，有霉烂虫蚀现象，而且品种不齐；农田水利工程在很多地方没有按计划修好；一部分地区耕畜瘦弱和死亡的情形严重，畜力缺乏。这种情况，在去年遭灾或原来基础较差的地区比较严重，但一般地区也不是完全没有。例如去年丰收的湖北省，有些人老早就认为已经“万事俱备”了，但经过检查，到2月中旬全省中小型农田水利工程只完成30％—40％，积肥计划在先进地区只完成70％。如果只看到平均数字或情况较好的部分，就会使领导的思想麻痹，贻误大事。据山西榆次县检查，曙光等三十六个农业社已经全部完成积肥计划，并有四分之一送到地里；而东后沟等四十四个农业社却只完成计划的三分之一。因此，普遍检查备耕工作是十分必要的。
    检查备耕工作不仅是要检查种子、耕畜、农具等生产资料的准备情形，而且也要检查生产计划和劳动组织。物质资料是否充足，对春耕生产有很大影响。但即使物资准备较好，如果劳力组织调配不好，到时候手忙脚乱，顾此失彼，也会使春耕生产发生障碍。生产计划是奋斗的目标和具体部署，订得低了，会降低推动生产向前发展的作用；订得过高，没有实现的可能，也会使群众失去信心。因此，必须好好检查一下计划是否积极，是否可靠。去年有些地方在订计划的时候，由上到下，层层加大，以致计划偏高。今年一般地说，各地农业社订的计划比去年切实得多了，但也发现有一些农业社因为害怕再犯主观主义，又有层层缩减计划的偏向。这是一个值得注意的问题。技术改革方面，去年有不少地方不看具体条件，盲目采用新技术，今年已经纠正。但是有一些地方又有一概否定技术改革的错误想法，这也需要注意纠正。技术改革方面的准备，也要深入检查。比如，扩大复种面积等工作，如果没有充分准备，就不免要重复去年所发生的缺点。
    在检查备耕的同时，要检查小麦和其他夏熟作物的田间管理工作，缺肥的要赶快追补，受旱的要及时浇灌，以争取小麦及其他夏熟作物的丰收。
    检查的目的是为了解决问题，因此发现了问题就要赶快采取有效的办法来解决。有些地方发现耕畜瘦弱、畜力不足，就立即加强饲养管理，适当增加饲料，并组织人力送粪，以弥补畜力的不足。这样便收到了推动工作的效果。如果把检查和解决问题分成两个阶段，等检查完毕以后再去解决问题，那就晚了。
    有的地方可能一下子检查出很多问题，却不可能一下子都解决。这就必须把问题排一排队，分别轻重缓急，对春耕生产影响大的先解决，影响小的后解决。至于并社、转社以及处理决算分配等工作，有的可以停止，等到麦收或秋收以后再做，有的可以在生产中结合处理。总之，必须把工作重心转移到春耕生产上来，不能遇到什么问题就纠缠在什么问题上，也不能希望一下子把所有问题都完全解决。
    检查备耕工作不要形成单纯查缺点，找毛病，而要发现问题，并找出解决问题的办法。不仅要检查薄弱环节、工作较差的地区，也要检查工作较好的地区，把好的经验和好的办法加以总结和提高，推广出去，用先进带动落后，推动整个工作。
    为了使检查工作有成效，除了自上而下地派干部深入检查以外，更重要的是发动群众自下而上地检查，把检查过程变成群众自觉活动和自我教育的过程。群众对去年的工作有什么好的意见，对今年争取农业大丰收有什么好的建议，都应当认真收集起来，加以研究，使各方面的工作都能迅速改进，领导水平能够很快提高。春耕准备工作做得好的单位，应当受到群众的表扬和鼓励，不好的应当受到批评教育。通过这样的检查，可以加强社员对于集体事业的责任心，也可以大大提高他们生产的积极性。
    今年在备耕中既要充分发挥青壮年农民的积极性，也要充分发挥老农的作用。凡是要广大农民行动的，都应当同群众商量，并且广泛听取老农的意见。多数老农不赞成办的事情，一般地不要轻率地、勉强地去做。
