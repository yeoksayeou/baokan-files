　　"Men and Women Working Together, Increased Production is No Worry"
　　Yun Xiutong Discusses the Participation of Women in Production in Inner Mongolia

　　I fully endorse Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people at the Supreme State Conference, Premier Zhou's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries, and Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of several issues concerning the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan. I completely agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the Standing Committee and Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech on the movement to increase production and practice economy.

　　After listening to the reports, I received extremely profound education and enlightenment, and I feel boundless excitement and encouragement. I must implement all the resolutions of the conference.

　　I am a woman worker, and I will only talk about my personal experiences.

　　In recent years, under the brilliant light of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's great ethnic policy, our Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has victoriously promoted regional autonomy and entered a new period of building Inner Mongolia. Whether in politics, economy, culture, education, or health construction, there has been a leap forward development, realizing national equality, mutual assistance, and a united and friendly family, and a new ethnic relationship has emerged. The material and cultural life of all ethnic groups has generally improved. The face of the autonomous region has undergone fundamental changes. Women of all ethnic groups, along with the people of all ethnic groups, under the leadership and close care of the Party and the People's Government, have received a series of political and ideological education and training. Their socialist consciousness has greatly improved. Living in a warm ethnic family, they fully enjoy various political rights of equality between men and women. Women representatives account for 15% of the total number of representatives in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Congress. There are ten female banner and county heads (including five Mongolians) and thirty-nine female district heads in the region. There are female presidents, female presiding judges, and female judges in people's courts at all levels. There are 10,339 female cadres in the organs. A large number of female cadres, including female township heads and deputy heads, female directors and deputy directors, and production team leaders, have also been assigned to various townships and agricultural and pastoral cooperatives. The vast majority of these female backbone elements can actively produce, maintain close ties with the masses, and work hard, and are supported by the masses.

　　Now, the socialist transformation has achieved a decisive victory, changing the relations of production and changing ownership, creating the most favorable social conditions for the cause of women's liberation. Women of all ethnic groups have actively and enthusiastically devoted themselves to industrial, agricultural, pastoral, and forestry production and construction, making unprecedented great achievements, and many advanced producers and model figures have emerged.

　　After Chairman Mao's report on the issue of agricultural cooperativization and the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), a high tide of agricultural cooperativization was universally set off in rural areas, adhering to the policy of mobilizing both men and women. The enthusiasm of rural women to take the socialist road has become even higher. Because the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women was implemented in advanced agricultural cooperatives, it strongly attracted and encouraged the broad masses of women to participate in the agricultural increase production movement. The number of people participating in agricultural increase production has generally increased, and the attendance rate is higher than in any previous year. Women who never participated in labor have also gone to the fields to produce. Therefore, women have become a huge force on the agricultural increase production and agricultural production front, showing a new atmosphere and demonstrating the superiority of socialism. 80% of female members participate in production, and some areas reach more than 90%. They have learned technology and improved labor productivity in various productions such as spring plowing, summer hoeing, and autumn harvest, and actively participate in labor competitions. They have played a great role, and the labor days earned generally reach sixty to seventy, and up to two hundred at most. In this way, women's status in the economy, society, and family has undergone great changes, reversing some people's views of underestimating women. A strong public opinion has emerged in rural areas, "If men work but women don't, the plan is difficult to realize; if men and women work together, increased production is no worry." At the same time, harmonious and united new families have emerged. Women are also a great force in sideline production, and raising pigs, raising chickens, and other sideline production have played a great role in family income, the accumulation of social wealth, and the bumper agricultural harvest.

　　The women of our district's herdsmen have always been skilled laborers. With the development of pastoral cooperativization, they have become a vital force in developing animal husbandry production. They improve and enhance management, improve technology, disinfect and cut umbilical cords, and play a great role in disaster resistance, livestock protection, and lambing protection. For example, Jiri Gele of the New Barag Left Banner in Hulunbuir League led nine women to do a good job in lambing protection, with a survival rate of 90.65%, and was rewarded. She said with emotion: "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, can all ethnic groups unite like a family, and can ethnic minorities be completely liberated."

　　The state has always attached importance to and cared for the health and welfare work in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In recent years, a series of specific measures have been taken to eliminate the diseases and disasters left to the people of Inner Mongolia by the old China. Preventing plague, eradicating syphilis, and vigorously carrying out maternal and child health work have ensured the implementation of the "prosperity of both people and livestock" policy; vigorously publicizing the benefits of new-style delivery and the launch of the patriotic health movement, the fertility rate of herdsmen women has increased, the infant mortality rate has been greatly reduced, and women who have not had children for many years have embraced fat babies.

　　Women's federations at all levels closely cooperate with relevant departments to jointly carry out women and children's welfare work. In rural areas, in the spirit of running cooperatives diligently and frugally, they train nursery staff and organize various forms of nurseries, kindergartens (teams), as well as mutual assistance between relatives and neighbors and individual fostering, solving the problem of some women participating in production without anyone to take care of their children. According to incomplete statistics in 1956 in four leagues, two administrative regions, two suburbs, and three banners and counties, there were 11,357 rural busy season childcare organizations (1,094 childcare groups, 709 nurseries, 7 kindergartens, 61 kindergarten teams (classes)), with 54,448 children in care, more than ten times more than in 1955, allowing working women to work and produce with peace of mind. Although the above has achieved certain results, due to our bureaucracy, insufficient immersion in reality, and thinking lagging behind the development of the situation, failing to keep up with objective requirements, there are still shortcomings and errors in our work.

　　At present, with the rapid development of agricultural and pastoral production and the increasing participation of women in production, the issue of labor protection for women and children is seriously attracting our attention. In last year's agricultural increase production movement, some places did not take good care of women's housework, and did not pay enough attention to protecting the safety and health of women and children, resulting in casualties of women and children and miscarriages and premature births of pregnant women. This year, in the movement to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture and animal husbandry, we must pay attention to this issue and earnestly implement the spirit of the Third National Conference on Women and Children's Welfare. First of all, we must publicize and educate the national policy of protecting women and children to men and women, and community cadres, so that everyone understands that women are an important force in labor production, and also have the responsibility of nurturing the second generation. Therefore, we must change the phenomenon in some men and women that they do not pay attention to the safety and health of women in production, and at the same time educate women to take care of their own health. More importantly, we must reasonably arrange women's labor force, resolutely continue to implement the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women, and hold various simple and flexible childcare organizations to solve the problem of children not being cared for at home. Practice has proved that running small childcare organizations is currently very popular with the masses, so it is more appropriate to have unified leadership by the community and decentralized托管.

　　At this CPPCC conference, I listened to Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech on increasing production and practicing economy. In 1957, we must launch a nationwide movement to increase production and practice economy. Increasing production and practicing economy is a method of carrying out socialist construction, and the women of all ethnic groups warmly support it. Increasing production, practicing thrift, opposing extravagance and waste, and accumulating funds to build socialism is a long-term political task of the people of the whole country. Our women's federation organizations at all levels must widely and deeply carry out publicity and education on the movement to increase production and practice economy, to achieve household awareness and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and establish the idea of "building the country diligently and frugally, running enterprises diligently and frugally, running cooperatives diligently and frugally, and running all undertakings diligently and frugally" and the fine style of hard work and plain living. We must reasonably arrange life plans with the spirit of managing the household diligently and frugally, being thrifty and frugal, living within our means, and careful calculation, implement the "five goods" into practical action, actively act from various work posts and production lines, give full play to women's strengths, accumulate funds for the country, save food (half a catty or one catty of food per person per month), and promote the savings movement. This is the glorious task of our women. The women of all ethnic groups in our Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region must try every possible means to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture and animal husbandry in our region, and work hard to complete and over fulfill the first five-year plan and welcome the second five-year plan.

　　The above is my personal experience. If there is anything inappropriate, please correct me, members. (Attached picture)

　　“男女齐动手，增产不用愁”
　　云秀桐谈内蒙古妇女参加生产等情况
    我完全拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的报告，周总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一个国家的报告和李富春副总理关于第二个五年计划建议若干问题的说明，完全同意陈叔通副主席关于常务委员会的工作报告及陈云副总理关于增产节约运动的发言。
    听了报告之后，我受到了极其深刻的教育和启示，感到无比的兴奋和鼓舞，一定要把大会各项决议贯彻执行。
    我是一个妇女工作者，仅就我个人的体会谈谈。
    我们内蒙古自治区几年来在共产党、毛主席伟大的民族政策光辉照耀下，胜利地推行了区域自治而进入建设内蒙古的新时期。不论在政治、经济、文化、教育、卫生建设事业各方面，都有了飞跃的发展，实现了民族平等、互助团结友爱的大家庭，出现了新的民族关系，各族人民的物质文化生活普遍提高，自治区的面貌已发生了根本变化，各族妇女和各族人民一道，在党和人民政府的领导和亲切关怀下，受到了一系列的政治思想教育和培养，社会主义觉悟大大提高，生活在温暖的民族大家庭里，充分地享受着男女平等的各种政治权利。内蒙古自治区人民代表大会的妇女代表占代表总数的15％，全区有女旗、县长十名（其中蒙古族五名），女区长三十九名，各级人民法院中有女院长、女庭长、女审判员，机关女干部有一万零三百三十九名，各乡、各农牧合作社，还大量配备了妇女干部、正副女乡长、正副主任、生产队长组长等，这些妇女骨干分子，绝大多数人都能积极生产，都能密切联系群众，努力工作，受到群众的拥护。
    现在，社会主义改造取得了决定性胜利，改变了生产关系，改变了所有制，为妇女解放事业创造了最优越的社会条件，各族妇女积极热情地投入工、农、牧、林业生产建设事业，做出了前所未有的巨大成就，也涌现出不少先进生产者和模范人物。
    毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告及
  全国农业发展纲要（草案）公布后，农村普遍掀起了农业合作化的高潮，坚持了男女一齐发动的方针，农村妇女群众走社会主义的积极性更为高涨。由于实现了高级农业合作社按劳取酬、男女同工同酬的原则，就强烈地吸引和鼓舞广大妇女群众，参加农业增产运动的人数普遍增多，出勤率之高超过以往任何一年，从来不参加劳动的妇女也下地生产了。因此妇女成为农业增产、农业生产战线上的巨大力量，出现了新气象，显示了社会主义的优越性。女社员有80％参加生产，有的地区达到90％以上，她们在春耕、夏锄、秋收各种生产中，学会了技术和提高劳动生产率，积极参加劳动竞赛。发挥了很大作用，所得劳动日，一般达到六十到七十个，最多达到二百个。这样妇女在经济、社会、家庭的地位就有了很大转变，扭转了一些人轻视妇女的看法，农村里出现了一种有力舆论，“男干女不干，计划难实现；男女齐动手，增产不用愁。”同时也出现了和睦团结的新家庭。妇女在副业生产上也是一支很大力量，养猪喂鸡和其他副业生产，在家庭收入和社会财富的积累上、在农业大丰收上起了很大作用。
    我区牧民妇女历来是劳动能手，随着牧业合作化的发展，已成为发展畜牧业生产的一支有生力量。她们改进和提高经营管理，提高技术，消毒断脐带，在抗灾保畜接羔保羔工作中，起着很大作用。如呼伦贝尔盟新巴尔虎左旗吉日格勒带动了九名妇女做好接羔保羔工作，成活率达到90.65％，得到奖励。她感动地说：“只有在共产党、毛主席的领导下，各民族团结得像一家人，少数民族才能得到彻底解放。”
    国家对内蒙古自治区的卫生福利工作，一贯重视和关怀。几年来进行了一系列的具体措施，清除了旧中国给内蒙古人民遗留下来的疾病、灾难。防鼠疫、驱梅毒，大力开展了妇幼卫生工作，保证了“人畜两旺”政策的实施；大力宣传新法接生的好处以及爱国卫生运动的开展，牧民妇女生育率提高，婴儿死亡率大大减少，多年不生孩子的妇女抱上了胖娃娃。
    各级妇联组织密切配合协助有关部门，共同进行妇女儿童福利工作。在农村以勤俭办社的精神，训练保育员，组织了多种多样的托儿所、幼儿园（队）以及亲邻相帮、个别寄托，解决了部分妇女参加生产孩子无人照管的问题。据1956年在四个盟，二个行政区，二个郊区，三个旗、县的不完全统计，有农忙托儿组织一万一千三百五十七处（托儿组一千零九十四个，托儿所七百零九处，幼儿园七处，幼儿队（班）六十一处），受托孩子五万四千四百四十八名，比1955年增十倍多，使劳动妇女安心生产和工作。以上虽取得一定成绩，但由于我们的官僚主义，深入实际不够，思想落后于形势的发展，赶不上客观要求，因此在我们工作中还存在着缺点和错误。
    目前随着农牧业生产的迅速发展，妇女群众参加生产的日益增多，妇女儿童劳动保护是严重地引起我们注意的问题，在去年农业增产运动中，有些地方没有很好地照顾妇女家务劳动，没有充分注意保护妇女、儿童的安全和健康，以致发生妇女、儿童的伤亡事故和孕妇流产、小产现象。今年在争取农牧业大丰收运动中，必须注意这一问题，切实贯彻全国第三次妇女儿童福利会议精神，首先把国家保护妇女儿童的政策向男女群众、社干部进行宣传教育，使大家了解妇女是劳动生产中的一支重要力量，又负有孕育第二代的责任。因此必须改变某些男女中不重视妇女在生产中的安全和健康的现象，同时教育妇女爱护自身健康。更重要的是合理安排妇女劳动力，坚决继续贯彻男女同工同酬原则，举办多种多样简便灵活的托儿组织，解决孩子家中无人照管的问题。实践证明，举办小型托儿组织是目前很受群众欢迎的，所以由社统一领导分散托管较为适宜。
    我在这次政协会议上，听了陈云副总理关于增产节约发言，1957年要开展一个全国范围的增产节约运动。增产节约是进行社会主义建设的方法，我们各族妇女热烈拥护。增加生产、厉行节约、反对铺张浪费、积累资金来建设社会主义，这是全国人民的长期政治任务，我们妇联各级组织必须要广泛深入地开展增产节约运动的宣传教育工作，达到家喻户晓，深入人心，树立“勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办合作社、勤俭办一切事业”的思想和艰苦朴素的优良作风，我们要以勤俭持家、克勤克俭、量入为出、精打细算的精神，合理安排生活计划，把“五好”贯彻到实际行动中，从各种工作岗位上、生产战线上，积极行动起来，发挥妇女特长，为国家积累资金，节约粮食（每人每月半斤或一斤粮食），提倡储蓄运动。这是我们妇女的光荣任务，我们内蒙古自治区各族妇女一定要想尽一切办法，争取我区农牧业大丰收，为完成和超额完成第一个五年计划、迎接第二个五年计划而努力。
    以上是我个人的一点体会，有不妥之处，请各位委员指正。（附图片）
