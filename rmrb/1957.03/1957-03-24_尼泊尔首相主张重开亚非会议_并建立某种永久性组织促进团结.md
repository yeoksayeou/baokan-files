Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 23rd: According to a Kathmandu dispatch from the Indian Press Trust: On March 22nd, when discussing the world situation with reporters, Nepalese Prime Minister Acharya advocated holding the second Bandung Conference as soon as possible and establishing some kind of permanent organization of Asian-African countries.

He also said that he does not advocate establishing an "Eastern North Atlantic Treaty Organization."

Acharya said: "Our goal is to make unremitting efforts to promote the unity of Asian-African countries. In doing so, we will resolve all our local disputes without the mediation of major powers."

The Nepalese Prime Minister said that Asian and African countries have always had the experience that major powers want the countries in these regions to quarrel with each other. "They have always used small countries in their pursuit of the Cold War, and it is always the less developed and weaker countries that suffer because of the Cold War."

    尼泊尔首相主张重开亚非会议
    并建立某种永久性组织促进团结
    据新华社新德里23日电　据印度报业托辣斯加德满都消息：尼泊尔首相阿查里雅22日在和记者谈论世界形势时，主张早日召开第二次万隆国家会议和建立某种亚非国家的永久性组织。
    他又说，他并不主张建立“东方的北大西洋公约组织”。
    阿查里雅说：“我们的目标是要坚持不懈地努力促进亚非国家的团结。在这样做的过程中，我们将解决我们当地的一切争端，而不用大国的斡旋。”
    尼泊尔首相说，亚非国家一向有这样的经验：各大国希望这些地区的国家互相争吵。“它们在从事冷战中一向利用各小国，由于冷战而受害的总是不大发达的弱小国家”。
