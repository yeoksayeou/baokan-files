Xinhua News Agency, London: The United Nations Disarmament Commission's Subcommittee held secret meetings on the 19th, 20th, and 21st to conduct a general debate on the disarmament proposals put forward by various countries. According to conference sources, the representatives who spoke expressed their attitudes towards the disarmament proposals of various countries, and some Western representatives requested that a point-by-point discussion of various issues in disarmament be held at the beginning of next week.

Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: According to the early March issue of "U.S. News & World Report," U.S. military spending has increased forty-two times in the past twenty years. Among them, military personnel costs have increased twenty-four times, and military equipment expenditures have increased fifty-four times.

The magazine said that in the 1939 fiscal year, U.S. Army spending was $400 million, and Navy spending was $600 million. There was no independent Air Force at that time. In the 1958 fiscal year, Army spending is estimated at $9.1 billion, Navy at $10.3 billion, Air Force at $17.5 billion, and reserves, atomic weapons, and military "aid" at $6.4 billion.

The magazine also said that during the same period, the number of military personnel increased from 329,000 to 2,794,000; active warships increased from 415 to 983; and military aircraft increased from 2,402 to 41,301.

Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd, Paris: The National Audit Committee, led by French Radical Socialist leader Mendès France, stated in its annual report that in 1956, French production increased by 5% compared to 1955, while national expenditures (mainly military expenses) increased by nearly 30%. This resulted in a trade deficit of 400 billion francs.

The report pointed out that the Algerian war is the main reason for the increase in imports of military materials, especially the decrease in exports, which has caused the foreign trade deficit.

The report pointed out that the value of materials used for defense was 300 billion francs in 1955, 430 billion francs in 1956, and is estimated to reach 535 billion francs in 1957.

　　裁军会议讨论各国裁军建议
　　美国军费在二十年内增加四十二倍
　　法国家审计委员会为军费负担叫苦
    据新华社讯　伦敦消息：联合国裁军委员会小组委员会于19、20日和21日连续举行秘密会议，就各国提出的裁军建议进行一般性辩论。据会议人士透露，发言的代表对于各国的裁军建议表明了他们的态度，一些西方代表要求在下周初对裁军中各个问题进行逐点的讨论。
    据新华社22日讯　据3月初一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”说，在最近二十年内，美国的军事费用增加了四十二倍。其中军事人员费用增加了二十四倍，军备支出增加了五十四倍。
    这个杂志说，在1939财政年度中，美国陆军支出是四亿美元，海军支出是六亿美元，那时还没有独立的空军。在1958财政年度中，估计陆军支出为九十一亿美元，海军为一百零三亿美元，空军为一百七十五亿美元，储备、原子武器和军事“援助”为六十四亿美元。
    杂志还说，在同一时期内，军队人数由三十二万九千人增加到了二百七十九万四千人；现役军舰由四百十五艘增加到了九百八十三艘；军用飞机由二千四百零二架增加到了四万一千三百零一架。
    据新华社22日讯　巴黎消息：法国激进社会党领袖孟戴斯—弗朗斯领导的国家审计委员会发表的年度报告说，1956年法国生产量同1955年比较增长了5％，而国家开支（主要是军事费用）增加了将近30％。结果造成对外贸易上四千亿法郎的逆差。
    报告指出，阿尔及利亚战争是增加军事物资进口、尤其使得出口减少从而造成对外贸易赤字的主要原因。
    报告指出用在国防方面的物资价值1955年为三千亿法郎，1956年为四千三百亿法郎，1957年估计将达五千三百五十亿法郎。
