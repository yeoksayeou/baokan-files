On the Study of the History of Philosophy
　　Hu Sheng

I.

Recently, some questions regarding the purpose, scope, methods, and viewpoints of studying the history of philosophy have been raised among researchers in the history of philosophy. The Department of Philosophy at Peking University even held a discussion meeting on this in January of this year. Here, I would like to offer some opinions on several issues that were discussed.

It should be acknowledged that there have been achievements in the study of Chinese philosophy history in recent years. Although there are no large new works completed yet, some papers show that many Chinese philosophy history experts have made new achievements in their research work using Marxist viewpoints and methods. At the same time, it should also be pointed out that there are still dogmatic habits in our philosophy history research work. In some recent discussions of philosophical issues in newspapers and periodicals, we can see a situation: the issue being discussed is clearly a matter with practical content, but people do not specifically analyze this practical content, but instead try to find a related definition from authoritative or actually not authoritative works, as if the differences of opinion arise only because of different understandings of the same definition, as if as long as people find the correct interpretation of this definition, they can solve the problem. It must be said that this approach is precisely the "starting from definitions" approach criticized by Comrade Mao Zedong. Applying this approach to the study of philosophy history can only lead to the so-called "simplification" result.

Some articles have pointed out the phenomenon of simplification in our philosophy history research and teaching, for example, when conducting class analysis, simply putting "class labels" on various philosophical thoughts based on some general principles; for example, "Marxism becomes a form," filling in relevant sentences from various philosophical works in our "forms" to replace specific analysis and research. This situation certainly cannot be regarded as a scientific study of philosophy history. Some people say that after listening to lectures on philosophy history, students only feel that all materialists seem to be completely the same, and all idealists also seem to be completely the same. If a history of philosophy is written with such an attitude, even if it describes the struggle between materialism and idealism, it will surely make people feel that all such struggles in the history of philosophy are almost completely the same. People cannot rely on such philosophical history works to truly and specifically grasp the laws of ideological struggle and absorb rich experiences and lessons.

The dogmatic and simplistic tendency in the study of philosophy history is related to an inappropriate and incomplete understanding of the purpose and task of studying philosophy history.

In philosophy textbooks (textbooks on dialectical materialism), the differences and struggles between the materialist dialectical worldview and the idealist metaphysical worldview are summarized in terms of basic laws, and the relationship between the struggles in the field of philosophical thought and real life is explained. But as Lenin said, "Any law is narrow, incomplete, approximate," and "Phenomena are richer than laws." Studying the history of philosophy means directly facing rich phenomena, and using these phenomena to specifically explain the laws in the struggle and development of philosophy. Therefore, a scientific history of philosophy can truly enable people to understand how Marxist philosophy inherits the excellent heritage of all past philosophical thoughts, while overcoming the errors and one-sidedness of various past philosophies, and achieves a high degree of scientific and revolutionary nature. If in the study of philosophy history, we simply apply the principles in philosophy textbooks, and cannot use living flesh and blood to display the rich forms of expression of these principles, then in reality we are canceling the significance of the study of philosophy history.

The study of philosophy history does not only provide ready-made conclusions, but also helps people to exercise their theoretical thinking ability. Marxist philosophy itself is not stagnant, but is constantly developing forward. In order to promote Marxist philosophy, it is necessary to use the ability of theoretical thinking to summarize new experiences in social practice, summarize new achievements in scientific knowledge of nature and society, and conduct struggles against various idealist and metaphysical thoughts. Engels said in the "Old Preface to Anti-Dühring" that in order to exercise the ability of theoretical thinking, "there is still no other means than to study the philosophy of the past, up to the present." Philosophical problems that have been debated in history often reappear under new conditions, and the repeated struggles in history on the fundamental questions of philosophy will continue to appear in new forms. The history of philosophy not only has the experience of materialism overcoming idealism, but also the experience of some crude materialism being overcome by idealism, and the experience of materialists falling into idealism in some aspects due to some one-sidedness. Summarizing all these experiences is very beneficial to us.

The study of philosophy history is not only for the development of Marxist philosophy, but also for correctly evaluating the cultural and ideological heritage of past eras, in order to help build socialist culture. In order to build socialist culture, we need to critically and transform the culture of all past eras, and absorb its essence. For this, we need to seriously study the philosophy of each era—the most concentrated expression of the cultural and ideological thoughts of each era.

There is no doubt that it is of particular importance for us to study the history of the development of philosophical thought in China for three thousand years. This is not only because in order to build China's socialist culture, we must seriously treat China's rich cultural heritage, because the struggles on the ideological front that we are about to conduct will also be covered by the shadows cast by the philosophy of China's past eras, but also because China's philosophical history has not yet undergone sufficient scientific research, and this research will be able to further enrich the content of Marxist philosophy in some aspects.

Since these are our main purposes for studying the history of philosophy, it is obvious that if we do not use truly scientific methods to study the history of philosophy, that is, clarify the laws of philosophical development, and make specific and in-depth analysis of the rich content in the history of philosophy, we will not be able to achieve the purposes we want to achieve.

Dogmatic and simplistic methods are incompatible with our purpose of studying the history of philosophy. In some articles recently published that discuss the work of studying philosophy history, although they may not all point out the correct path to overcome dogmatism, they have a positive significance in opposing dogmatism and seeking ways to overcome dogmatism.

II.

Dogmatism seems to be upholding Marxism on the surface, but in reality it distorts and departs from Marxism.

Here, it is particularly important to mention the tendency to extremely simplify and caricature the theory and method of historical materialism. When the principle that social existence determines social consciousness is actually used to examine social life, no simplistic ideas can be allowed. Engels said: "According to the materialist conception of history, the determining factor in history is, in the last resort, the production and reproduction of real life. Neither I nor Marx have ever asserted more than this. If someone distorts this principle and says that the economic factor is the only determining factor, then he is turning this statement into meaningless, abstract, and absurd nonsense" (Letter to Joseph Bloch). Marxism requires us to see the complex interactions between various social superstructures, and the economic factor plays a determining role through this complex interaction; and it requires us to see the relative independence of various superstructures in their development process and their reaction to the economic base.

Some people think that the emergence and development of every philosophical thought in history should be able to be directly explained from economic relations and class relations, and it even seems that all the characteristics of various philosophical thoughts in content and even form are determined by the economy. It should be pointed out that this kind of view is a major misunderstanding of historical materialism.

Philosophy, as a superstructure, is very far from the material economic base, so Engels listed philosophy as "the ideological department towering high in the air." Economic relations and class relations can only be reflected to the field of philosophy indirectly through the complex social life, political life, and various aspects of cultural thought. Therefore, the reflection of the economic base in the field of philosophy is often not very accurate, but it appears vague and uneven due to passing through many intermediate links. At the same time, the relative independence of philosophical development must not be ignored. The specific form taken by the philosophy of an era is always related to the philosophical tradition before it (as far as a nation is concerned, the influence of foreign philosophical thoughts sometimes also plays an important role). Engels pointed out that "each era's philosophy, as a special department of labor, has a certain ideological material transmitted to it by its predecessors, from which it starts." Economic development can only play a role in philosophy within the scope permitted by the laws of philosophical development itself. "The economy does not recreate anything here, but it determines the change and further development of existing ideological materials" (Engels, Letter to Conrad Schmidt, October 27, 1890).

The history of Marxist philosophy itself can be used to illustrate this situation. The emergence of Marxist philosophy is of course closely related to the revolutionary struggle of the modern proletariat, but it would be wrong to think that just from the struggle of the modern proletariat, a complete theory of Marxist philosophy would naturally arise. We must also point out the relationship between Marxist philosophy and German classical philosophy and French materialist philosophy. Marxist philosophy accepts and transforms the valuable things in the ideological heritage of all past human philosophy. Without the ideological materials left by all previous generations, the emergence of Marxist philosophy in the mid-nineteenth century is inconceivable.

But it is impossible to explain the emergence of Marxist philosophy only from the laws of philosophical development itself. The various corrupt idealist philosophies of the modern bourgeoisie should also be said to have used many ideological materials left by their predecessors, starting from this and forming their own system. Why is it that in the Marxists' case, this part of the existing ideological material is particularly valued, and such transformations and developments are made to these ideological materials; while in the modern bourgeoisie, which part of the material is valued, and what kind of transformations and developments are made? This cannot be explained by the laws of ideological development itself.

Therefore, the historical materialist viewpoint requires us to find the fundamental reasons that determine the development trend of philosophy from the conditions of social material life, and also requires us to fully consider all the factors that affect the process of philosophical development, especially the relationship of inheritance and struggle within philosophy itself. Here, our task is to oppose both returning to the old path of simply explaining thoughts with thoughts, which is the old path of idealism, and opposing turning historical materialism into crude economic determinism.

In our study of philosophy history, the tendency to simplify the principles of historical materialism is further strengthened by an unrealistic imagination of the thoughts and life of philosophers. Some people seem to have a predetermined starting point in their research: in a person we call a philosopher, his worldview and his methodology, ethics, etc., his philosophical views and his political attitude, his understanding and practical actions, and even his class origin and the class line in his life activities should all be completely consistent. Of course, such completely consistent people exist in real life and in history, but among historical figures, it can be said that there are more people with this contradiction or that contradiction. For philosophers in history before the emergence of Marxism, except for some who stood on the completely reactionary side, some kind of contradiction in the ideological system and some kind of contradiction between theory and practice was almost an inevitable fate, not to mention the ideological contradictions of a person in different periods of his life. The various contradictions existing in philosophers are, generally speaking, also a reflection of certain social existence, and are not incomprehensible. The task of researchers is to point out and analyze these contradictions, and reach the conclusions that should be reached. For example, we see that before the emergence of Marxism, the French materialists of the eighteenth century fell into idealist views on social and historical issues, and the socialists of the early nineteenth century could only express their progressive ideas in a utopian form, saying that socialism was the requirement of absolute reason and justice. The contradictions and weaknesses of past materialists and socialists show us that we must implement the materialist viewpoint in the social and historical aspects, and build socialism on the scientific materialist basis. Of course, we cannot imagine that the conclusion reached by summarizing all the experience of cognition and practice in human social life is completely embodied in every thinker in history, and once we see a situation that does not conform to this imagination, we think that there is an "exception" that destroys a certain "law." - In fact, such a law does not exist in the first place.

Some "dogmas" of this kind, which are unknown from where they come from, should be broken. For example, Mr. Zhu Bokun pointed out in his article that "some people once believed that in Chinese feudal society, peasants were exploited classes, so the philosophical views reflecting the peasants should be materialist," so, "since it is affirmed that the ancient Taoists are a materialist school, then we should try to prove that they represent the interests of the peasants" (see People's Daily, October 14, 1956). Can it be imagined that there is such a regulation: peasants in the feudal era should produce materialist philosophical views, and materialists in the feudal era should represent the interests of the peasants? I think no one can say from which "classic" this arbitrary statement comes. In fact, although peasants have a simple materialist view starting from actual production, due to the narrowness, dispersion, and closedness of rural cultural life of small production, even if the peasants in the feudal era could not get rid of the shackles of idealism when launching armed revolutions, and they usually expressed their struggle ideals with religious fantasies, Marxists would not find this fact incomprehensible.

Binding oneself in some simple formulas that are divorced from reality, to the point of hindering specific analysis of specific situations, it is impossible to give a scientific explanation of philosophy history by this method, and of course it is impossible to overcome the idealist viewpoint in the study of philosophy history.

III.

Starting from the requirement of overcoming dogmatism, we need to consider how to evaluate idealist philosophy and how to explain the struggle between materialism and idealism. - There are some different views on this issue now.

Is it a way to overcome dogmatism to evaluate idealist philosophy higher and study idealist philosophy more?

In response to the idea of simply regarding idealist philosophy as nonsense and thinking that there is no need to study it, we should say that we must attach importance to the role of idealist philosophy in the history of philosophical development and study it seriously. Only by understanding idealism can people become completely scientifically conscious materialists; only by studying idealist philosophy deeply, not superficially, can people become materialist philosophical researchers. But if it is thought that the reason why dogmatism arises in our research work is only because idealism has not been studied enough, then it does not conform to the facts. People may also study idealist philosophy with a dogmatic attitude, which will never solve our problem; of course, we cannot study idealist philosophy with an idealist viewpoint.

Does dividing all philosophies, in the final analysis, into the two major camps of materialism and idealism, create a dogmatic tendency in the study of philosophy history?

Of course, it would be wrong to think that as long as we have classified a certain philosophical thought into the camp of materialism or idealism, we do not need to conduct specific analysis and research on it. In fact, it is impossible to make a judgment on the thoughts of many philosophers without detailed research. Idealist philosophy has had various different forms, and materialist philosophy has also had various different forms. Not every philosopher directly and simply states the essence of his worldview. Many philosophers adopt a materialist viewpoint in this aspect, and hold an idealist viewpoint in another aspect; and there are also many people in the history of philosophy who attempt to seek a third path in the form of dualism, or lack theoretical thoroughness, and always waver between materialism and idealism. Judging that a philosopher is basically an idealist or a materialist after comprehensive research is not the so-called labeling work, but the revelation of the essence of this philosopher's thought. Mr. Zheng Xin said in his article: "Do not confine the history of philosophy to the framework of the struggle between materialism and idealism, but give it rich content" (see "Open Idealism," People's Daily, October 18, 1956). It cannot be said that the meaning of this statement is unclear. We should oppose simplifying and formulating the rich history of the struggle between materialism and idealism, but seeing the history of philosophy as basically the history of the struggle between materialism and idealism according to the facts will never make the history of philosophy lose its rich content.

There is a view that, for fear of the simplification of philosophy history, it is thought that although we should distinguish between materialism and idealism, it is best not to determine that materialism is correct and idealism is wrong.

Admitting the difference between materialism and idealism, and seeing the history of philosophy as the history of the struggle between materialism and idealism, does not necessarily mean studying philosophy history from a Marxist point of view. Idealists can also admit the fundamental opposition between materialism and idealism. The mutual struggle between materialism and idealism in the history of philosophy is an objective fact. Idealist philosophy historians cannot but take this struggle as their research object in reality, although idealist philosophy historians are often unwilling to publicly admit this research object, and they always reflect this struggle in a distorted and one-sided way.

When Marxists study the history of philosophy, they clearly distinguish between materialism and idealism, openly admit the struggle between materialism and idealism, and more importantly, Marxists want to stand on the highest stage of development of materialism, the position of dialectical materialism, to discuss this struggle, and reflect the history of the germination, occurrence, growth, and development of dialectical materialist philosophical thought through this struggle. Standing on the position of defending the materialist tradition is by no means to completely deny historical idealist philosophy, but to truly give it a scientific estimate.

It should be pointed out that, on the one hand, the philosophical viewpoint of materialism is correct, and the philosophical viewpoint of idealism is wrong, this distinction is absolute. On the other hand, although the materialist philosophical viewpoint is correct, materialists in history often fall into error because of the lack of dialectical thought, because they cannot implement the materialist viewpoint in all aspects; and although the idealist philosophical viewpoint is wrong, the large amount of ideological material accumulated by idealist philosophy in the history of philosophical development has a significant role in the development of materialism; the idealist philosophy of various periods has raised some new questions, and also stimulated the development of materialism; some aspects and some fragments of objective reality cannot but be reflected in idealist philosophy, although this reflection is always one-sided, distorted, and attached with wrong explanations. Because of this, we can never replace the specific analysis of the complex content of philosophy history with one or two simple basic formulas. At the same time, we cannot say in general, "There are also benefits in idealism." This unanalyzed proposition cannot bring people a clear idea. Mr. He Lin said in his article: "The philosophical thoughts that once served or more or less served the feudal landlords and the bourgeoisie can now or in the future... also serve the working class" (see "Opinions on Two Controversial Issues in the Study of Philosophy History," People's Daily, January 30). This is clearly not in line with the facts. It is certain that the working class can benefit from the study and criticism of various idealist philosophies of the past and present. But if the boundary between materialism and idealism is confused, and we turn to the position of idealism away from the materialist position, it will only be harmful and not beneficial.

There is also a view that, in view of the fact that people who are politically progressive are not necessarily materialists, and idealists are not necessarily holding reactionary political views, it is best to use the standards of progress and reaction (or conservatism, backwardness) to divide various philosophical thoughts, instead of the standards of materialism and idealism. I think doing so is not good for scientifically studying philosophy history.

Generally speaking, philosophical materialism is the most powerful weapon for social classes and groups that play a progressive role in history, and it is in line with their needs and can reflect their interests. But it is not that all progressive classes and groups in history can systematically use this weapon at any time, and immature classes often use idealist viewpoints to express their revolutionary demands. This is not only because their progressiveness is incomplete, but also because: first, it is not a simple matter for a progressive class or group to be able to clearly recognize what the weapon that is truly applicable to them in the field of philosophy is, and a process of exploration is often necessary. Second, a complete materialist philosophy cannot be produced merely from progressive political tendencies, but also requires many necessary conditions, and the preparation of existing philosophical materials and the state of scientific knowledge development play an important role. On the other hand, for reactionary and conservative classes, idealism is the most convenient weapon they can use. In fact, all reactionary exploiting classes in history have always regarded idealist philosophy as their tool. But it can never be determined that at any time, weapons with materialist colors cannot be found from the ideological arsenal of the reactionary class. This is because, in its insufficiently developed state, the harmfulness of materialism to the reactionary class is not obvious at a glance; and a certain one-sided materialist viewpoint can also be given reactionary content. As for individual philosophers, as mentioned earlier, it is not a strange thing that his philosophical thought tendency and political tendency contradict each other. This contradiction may be temporarily unconscious to the philosopher himself, but its development inevitably requires a solution, and solving this contradiction is often not something that can be completed in one person's life, but requires several generations.

From the history of philosophy, we can see the combination of materialism and progressive revolutionary tendencies, and the combination of idealism and conservative reactionary tendencies, and we can also see that although a certain idealist philosophy is temporarily combined with a progressive political tendency, it ultimately cannot serve the progressive political tendency well, although the reactionary forces sometimes use a certain materialist viewpoint, they can only use materialism in a distorted and one-sided way in the end; and the closer to modern times, the more clearly the struggle between the two major camps in philosophy reflects the struggle between progressive forces and reactionary forces.

Marxism cannot admit such a "formula," as if in human history, all revolutionaries must be materialists, and conservatives must resolutely defend idealism. It is very harmful for people to take the crude definitions in some pamphlets as guides when studying philosophy history.

Therefore, we should analyze various materialist philosophies and idealist philosophies realistically and according to what role they played and how they played this role under specific historical conditions. It is too simple to directly equate philosophical materialism and idealism with political progress and conservatism, and we should reject this method. But if we set aside the difference between materialism and idealism in order to oppose this simple method, and regard materialism and idealism as equally able to serve both progressive and reactionary political tendencies, then the result will inevitably only lead to blurring the boundaries between materialism and idealism in theoretical principles, and blurring the party spirit of philosophy.

    关于哲学史的研究
　　胡绳
　　一
    最近在哲学史研究工作者中间，提出了一些有关哲学史研究的目的、范围、方法、观点等方面的问题；北京大学哲学系在今年
  1月里还为此召开了讨论会。在这里，我想对讨论中涉及的几个问题说一些意见。
    应当承认，近年来中国哲学史研究是有成绩的。虽然还没有成本的较大的新著作，但是有一些论文表明不少中国哲学史专家在用马克思主义的观点、方法来进行研究工作中已经取得了新的成就。同时也应当指出，在我们的哲学史研究工作中还存在着教条主义习气。近来在报刊上的有些哲学问题的讨论中可以看到一种情形：所讨论的问题明明是一个有实际内容的问题，但是人们却不去具体分析这个实际内容，而只是努力从权威的或其实并非权威的著作中寻找一个有关的定义，好像不同的意见之所以发生只是因为对同一个定义的不同了解，好像只要人们对这个定义找到了正确的解释，就能够解决这个问题。不能不说，这种做法正是毛泽东同志所批评的“从定义出发”的做法。把这种做法用在哲学史研究上，只能得到所谓“简单化”的结果。
    有些文章指出了在我们的哲学史研究和教学中的简单化的现象，例如在进行阶级分析的时候只是根据某种一般的原则把“阶级的帽子”套在各种哲学思想的头上；例如
  “马克思主义成为表格”，把各家哲学著作中的有关语句分别填写在我们的“表格”中以代替具体的分析研究。这种情形的确不能算是科学地研究了哲学史。有人说，学生在听了哲学史的讲授以后，只觉得所有的唯物主义者好像是完全一样的，所有的唯心主义者也好像是完全一样的。如果是用这样的态度写出来的哲学史，虽然也写出了唯物论和唯心论的斗争，一定是使人觉得，哲学史上的所有这种斗争几乎也完全是一样的。人们不可能依靠这样的哲学史著作来真正具体地掌握思想斗争的规律，并吸取丰富的经验教训。
    在哲学史研究中产生教条主义的、简单化的倾向，是同对于研究哲学史的目的和任务的不恰当的、不完全的了解有关系的。
    在哲学教科书（辩证唯物主义教科书）中，概括地从基本规律上说明了唯物主义的辩证法的世界观同唯心主义的形而上学的世界观的区别和斗争，说明了哲学思想领域内的斗争同现实生活的关系。但是正像列宁所说的，“任何规律都是狭隘的、不完全的、近似的，”“现象比规律丰富。”研究哲学史就是直接面对丰富的现象，要通过这些现象来具体说明哲学的斗争和发展中的规律。所以科学的哲学史能够使人真正懂得马克思主义哲学怎样地继承了过去一切哲学思想中的优秀遗产，同时克服了过去各种哲学中的错误和片面性，而达到高度的科学性和高度的革命性。如果在哲学史研究中只是简单地套用哲学教科书中的原理，而不能用活的血和肉来显示这些原理的丰富的表现形态，那在实际上是取消了哲学史研究的意义。
    哲学史研究不只是提供现成的结论，而是要帮助人们锻炼理论的思维能力。马克思主义哲学本身不是停滞不动的，是要不断地向前发展的。为了推进马克思主义哲学，就必须运用理论的思维能力来总结社会实践中的新的经验，总结对于自然和社会的科学知识的新的成就，并且进行对各种唯心主义的、形而上学的思想的斗争。恩格斯在“反杜林论旧序”中曾说，为了锻炼理论的思维能力，“除了学习以往的哲学，直到现在还没有别的手段”。历史上争论过的哲学问题往往会在新的条件下重新出现，历史上反复进行的在哲学基本问题上的斗争将以新的形态继续出现。哲学史中不仅有唯物主义战胜唯心主义的经验，也有某种粗糙的唯物主义为唯心主义战胜，以及唯物主义者由于某种片面性而在某些方面陷入唯心主义的经验。总结这一切经验对于我们都是十分有益的。
    研究哲学史还不仅是为了发展马克思主义哲学，而且是为了正确地评价过去时代的其他一切文化思想遗产，以帮助建设社会主义文化。为建设社会主义文化，我们需要对以往一切时代的文化加以批判、改造，吸取其菁华。为此，就需要认真地研究各个时代的哲学——各个时代文化思想的最集中的表现。
    研究中国三千年来哲学思想发展历史，对于我们有特别重要的意义，这是毫无疑问的。这不仅因为我们为了建设中国的社会主义文化，必须认真地对待中国的丰富的文化遗产，因为我们所要进行的思想战线上的斗争，还会复盖着中国过去时代的哲学投下的影子，而且因为中国的哲学历史远没有经过充分的科学研究，这种研究将能够在有些方面更加丰富马克思主义哲学的内容。
    既然我们研究哲学史的主要目的就是这些，那么，很明显的，如果不是用真正科学的方法来研究哲学历史，既阐明哲学发展的规律性，又对哲学史中的丰富内容做具体的、深入的分析，我们所要达到的目的就不能够达到。
    教条主义的、简单化的方法是同我们研究哲学史的目的不能相容的。在最近发表的一些讨论哲学史研究工作的文章中，虽然未必都是指明了克服教条主义的正确道路，但是在反对教条主义，并且寻求克服教条主义的办法这一点上，它们是有积极意义的。
　　二
    教条主义在表面上好像是维护马克思主义，实际上却是歪曲和离开了马克思主义。
    在这里要特别提到把历史唯物主义的理论和方法极端地简单化、漫画化的倾向。把社会存在决定社会意识这一原理实际运用来考察社会生活的时候，不能容许任何简单化的想法。恩格斯曾说：“根据唯物史观，在历史过程中的决定因素归根到底是现实生活的生产和再生产。无论我或马克思从来都不过是如此断定而已。倘若有人把这个原理加以歪曲，说仿佛经济因素是唯一决定的因素，那末他就是把这个断语变成毫无意思的、抽象的、荒诞无稽的空话”（致约·布洛赫的信）。马克思主义要求看出在各种社会上层建筑之间的复杂的相互作用，经济因素是通过这种复杂的相互作用而起着决定作用的；并且要求看出各种上层建筑在其发展过程中对于经济基础的相对独立性以及它们对经济的反作用。
    有人以为，历史上每一种哲学思想的产生和发展都应当能够直接从经济关系和阶级关系上得到解释，甚至好像认为，各种哲学思想在内容上以至形式上的一切特征都是由经济决定的。应当指出，这一类看法是对于历史唯物主义的重大的误解。
    哲学，作为上层建筑，是和物质经济基础相距很远的，所以恩格斯曾把哲学列为
  “高高凌驾于空中的思想部门”。经济关系、阶级关系只能是透过复杂的社会生活、政治生活和文化思想的各个方面而曲折地反映到哲学领域上来。所以哲学领域中对经济基础的反映，常常不会是十分确切的，倒是由于经过许多中间环节而显得模糊和参差。同时，哲学发展的相对独立性又是决不能忽视的。一个时代的哲学所采取的具体形态，总是同在它以前的哲学传统有关的（就一个民族说，外来的哲学思想的影响有时也起着重要的作用）。恩格斯曾指出，“每一时代的哲学作为一个特殊的分工部门，都具有由它那些先驱者传授给它，而它便由以出发的一定思想资料作为前提。”经济发展对于哲学也就只能在哲学本身发展规律所许可的范围内起着作用。“经济在这里并不重新创造出任何东西，但它却决定着现有思想资料的改变和进一步发展情形”（恩格斯1890年10月27日致康·施米特信）。
    马克思主义哲学本身的历史就可以用来说明这种情形。马克思主义哲学的产生当然是和现代无产阶级的革命斗争密切相关的，但是如果认为只是从现代无产阶级的斗争中，就自然会产生马克思主义哲学这样的完整理论，那是不对的。我们还必须指出马克思主义哲学同德国古典哲学和法国唯物论哲学的关系。马克思主义哲学把人类以往一切哲学思想遗产中的有价值的东西接受过来，加以改造。离开一切前代留下来的思想资料，马克思主义哲学在十九世纪中叶的出现是不能设想的。
    但是如果只从哲学本身发展的规律，也决不能说明马克思主义哲学的产生。现代资产阶级的各种腐朽的唯心主义哲学也应当说是利用了前人留下来的许多思想资料，由此出发，构成自己的体系。为什么在马克思主义者这里，现有的思想资料中的这一部分特别被重视，并且对于这些思想资料作了这样的改造和发展；而在现代资产阶级那里，被重视的是那一部分资料，所作的是那样的改造和发展呢？这就不是思想发展规律本身所能说明的了。
    所以，历史唯物主义观点既要求我们从社会物质生活条件中找到决定哲学的发展趋向的根本原因，又要求我们充分考虑到影响哲学发展过程的一切因素，特别是哲学本身的继承和斗争的关系。在这里，我们的任务是既要反对退回到单纯用思想来说明思想的老路，这是唯心主义的老路，又要反对把历史唯物主义变成粗陋的经济决定论。
    在我们的哲学史研究中，把历史唯物主义的原理简单化的倾向还由于对哲学家的思想和生活的一种不合实际的设想而更加强。有人好像在研究中有一个预定的出发点：在一个我们称之为哲学家的人那里，他的世界观和他的方法论、伦理观等等，他的哲学观点和他的政治态度，他的认识和实际行动，以至他的阶级出身和他一生活动中的阶级路线都应当是完全一致的。当然，这样的完全一致的人在现实生活中和在历史上都是有的，但是在历史人物中间，可以说，更多地倒是存在着这一种矛盾或那一种矛盾的人。对于在马克思主义产生以前的历史上的哲学家说来，除了有些站在彻底反动的方面的以外，在思想体系中的某种矛盾以及在理论和实践之间的某种矛盾几乎是不可避免的命运，更不用说一个人在他一生的不同时期中的思想矛盾了。哲学家身上存在着的各种矛盾，一般说来，也是一定的社会存在的反映，不是不可理解的事。研究者的任务就在于指出和分析这种矛盾，达到应有的结论。例如，我们看到，在马克思主义产生以前，十八世纪的法国唯物论者在社会历史问题上陷入了唯心主义的观点，而十九世纪初期的社会主义者只能在空想的形式下表现他们的进步思想，把社会主义说成是绝对的理性和正义的要求。过去的唯物论者和社会主义者身上的矛盾和弱点使我们看到，必须把唯物主义观点贯彻到社会历史方面去，使社会主义建筑在科学的唯物主义基础上面。当然，我们不能设想，总结人类社会生活中认识和实践的全部经验而达到的结论完全地体现在历史上的每一个思想家身上，而一看到不符合这种设想的情形，就以为出现了破坏某种“规律”的“例外”。——其实这样的规律是本来就没有的。
    应当打破诸如此类的一些不知从何而来的“教条”。例如朱伯昆先生的文章中指出，“有人曾经认为，在中国的封建社会中，农民是被削剥的阶级，因此反映农民的哲学观点，应该是唯物主义的”，于是，“既然肯定古代道家是唯物主义流派，那末就应该想法证明他们代表农民的利益”（见人民日报1956年10月14日）。难道可以设想有这种规定么：封建时代的农民应当产生唯物主义哲学观点，而封建时代的唯物主义者应当代表农民利益？我想，任何人都说不出，这种武断出于何“经”何“典”。事实上，虽然农民从实际生产出发而具有朴素的唯物主义观点，但是由于小生产的狭隘性、散漫性和农村文化生活的闭塞，如果封建时代的农民虽在发动武装革命的时候，也不能摆脱唯心主义的束缚，而且通常都是借宗教的幻想来表达自己的斗争理想，对于这种事实，马克思主义者是不会觉得不可理解的。
    把自己束缚在一些脱离实际的简单的公式中间，以至妨害对具体情况做具体的分析，用这种办法，决不可能给哲学历史以科学的说明，当然也不可能克服在哲学史研究中的唯心主义观点。
　　三
    从克服教条主义的要求出发，我们需要来考虑一下如何估价唯心主义哲学以及如何说明唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争的问题。——在这问题上，现在存在着一些不同的看法。
    把唯心主义哲学估价高一点，多研究唯心主义哲学，这就是克服教条主义的办法么？
    针对那种把唯心主义哲学简单地看做胡说八道而认为用不着加以研究的想法，我们应当说，必须重视唯心主义哲学在哲学发展史中的作用，认真地加以研究。一定要懂得唯心主义，人们才能成为完全科学地自觉的唯物主义者；一定要深刻地、而不是肤浅地研究唯心主义哲学，人们才能成为唯物主义的哲学研究工作者。但是如果认为，我们的研究工作中之所以产生教条主义只是因为唯心主义学习得不够，那就不合乎事实了。人们也可能是用教条主义的态度来研究唯心主义哲学，那是决不能解决我们的问题的；当然我们更不能用唯心主义的观点来研究唯心主义哲学。
    把一切哲学，归根结底，分为唯物主义和唯心主义这两大阵营，这是否就会造成在哲学史研究中的教条主义倾向呢？
    当然，如果认为我们只要把某种哲学思想划进了唯物主义或唯心主义阵营之内，就不必再去对它进行具体的分析和研究，那是不对的。事实上，不经过详细研究，对于有许多哲学家的思想也不可能作出判断。唯心主义哲学曾经有各种不同的形态，唯物主义哲学也曾经有各种不同的形态。并不是每一个哲学家都直接了当地自己表明自己的世界观的实质。许多哲学家在这一方面采取唯物主义观点，而在另一方面又抱着唯心主义观点；而且哲学史上还有不少人企图在二元论的形式下寻求第三条道路，或者缺乏理论的贯彻性，始终徘徊于唯物唯心二者之间。经过全面的研究而判定一个哲学家在基本上是唯心主义者或唯物主义者，这并不是所谓贴标签的工作，而是对这种哲学家的思想的本质的揭发。郑昕先生的文章中说：“不将哲学史局限于唯物唯心斗争的框子里，而给它以丰富的内容”（见“开放唯心主义”一文，人民日报1956年10月18日）。不能不说，这种说法的含意是不明确的。我们应当反对把唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争的丰富历史作简单化的、公式化的描写，但是按照事实而把哲学史看做基本上是唯物主义和唯心主义斗争的历史，绝不会使哲学史丧失丰富的内容。
    有一种看法，由于担心哲学史的简单化，认为虽然要区别唯物主义和唯心主义，但最好不要断定唯物主义是正确的，而唯心主义是错误的。
    承认唯物主义和唯心主义的区别，并且把哲学史看做是唯物主义和唯心主义斗争的历史，这还不一定就是用马克思主义的观点来研究哲学史。唯心主义者也可以承认唯物主义和唯心主义的根本对立。唯物主义和唯心主义在哲学历史上的相互斗争是一个客观事实。唯心主义哲学史家实际上也不能不以这种斗争为自己的研究对象，虽然唯心主义哲学史家常常不愿意公开承认这种研究对象，并且他们总是歪曲地、片面地反映这种斗争。
    马克思主义者在研究哲学史的时候，明确地划分唯物主义和唯心主义，公开承认唯物主义和唯心主义之间的斗争，并且更重要的是，马克思主义者要站在唯物主义的最高发展阶段辩证唯物主义立场上来论述这种斗争，通过这种斗争来反映出辩证唯物主义哲学思想的萌芽、发生、成长和发展的历史。站在卫护唯物主义传统的立场上，决不是要把历史上的唯心主义哲学一笔抹煞，而是要真正给以科学的估计。
    应当指出，一方面，唯物主义的哲学观点是正确的，而唯心主义的哲学观点是错误的，这种区别是绝对的。另一方面，唯物主义哲学观点虽然是正确的，但是历史上的唯物主义者常常因为缺乏辩证法的思想，因为不能在各方面贯彻唯物主义观点而又陷入错误；而唯心主义哲学观点虽然是错误的，但在哲学发展史中，唯心主义哲学所积累的大量的思想资料，对于唯物主义的发展有重大的作用；各个时期的唯心主义哲学曾经提出了一些新的问题，也刺激了唯物主义的发展；唯心主义哲学中不能不反映到客观实际的某些方面和某些片段，虽然这种反映总是片面的、歪曲的，并且被附加上了错误的解释。正因为这样，我们决不能用一两个简单的基本公式来代替对哲学史的复杂内容的具体分析。同时，我们也不能笼统地说，“唯心主义中也有好处”，这种未经分析的命题不能带给人以确切的观念。贺麟先生的文章中说：“曾经或多或少地为封建地主、资产阶级服务的哲学思想，现在或今后……还可以替工人阶级服务”（见“对于哲学史研究中两个争论问题的意见”一文，人民日报1月30日）。这显然是不符合事实的。工人阶级可以从对于古往今来的各种唯心主义哲学的研究和批判中得到好处，这是一定的。但是如果混淆了唯物唯心的界限，离开唯物主义立场而倒向唯心主义的立场，那就只会是有害无益。
    还有一种看法，鉴于政治上进步的人不一定都是唯物主义者，唯心主义者不一定都是抱反动的政治观点，所以认为最好是用进步和反动（或保守、落后）的标准来划分各种哲学思想，以代替唯物主义和唯心主义的标准。我认为，这样做对于科学地研究哲学史是没有好处的。
    一般说来，哲学唯物主义对于在历史上起着进步作用的社会阶级、集团是最有力的武器，是符合它们的需要、能够反映它们的利益的。但是并不是在历史上的一切进步的阶级、集团在任何时候都能有系统地运用这个武器，还不成熟的阶级往往反而用唯心主义观点来表达他们的革命要求。这除了因为它们的进步性的不彻底以外，还因为：第一，一个进步的阶级或集团要能明确认识在哲学领域内对自己真正适用的武器是什么，并不是很简单的事，经过一个摸索的过程常常是必要的。第二，仅仅从进步的政治倾向中并不就能产生完整的唯物主义哲学，还要有许多必要的条件，现有的哲学资料的准备和科学知识发展状况是有重要作用的。另一方面，对于反动的、保守的阶级说来，唯心主义是他们所能利用的最方便的武器。事实上，历史上一切反动的剥削阶级总是把唯心主义哲学看做自己的工具。但是决不能断定在任何时候，不能从反动阶级思想武库中发现带有唯物主义色彩的武器。这是因为，唯物主义在其没有充分展开的状况下，对于反动阶级的危害性并不是一目了然的；而某种片面性的唯物主义观点也可以被赋与反动的内容。至于说到个别的哲学家，像前面已经提到过的，他的哲学思想倾向和政治倾向发生矛盾，那更不是什么奇怪的事情。这种矛盾可能暂时还是哲学家自己所不自觉的，但它的发展却必然地要求一种解决，而解决这种矛盾往往不是一个人的一生中所能完成，而需要经过好几代的时间。
    从哲学史上，我们可以看到唯物主义和进步的革命的倾向相结合，唯心主义和保守的反动的倾向相结合的事实，而且还可以看到，某种唯心主义哲学虽然暂时地同一种进步的政治倾向相结合，但它终究不能很好地为进步的政治倾向服务，反动势力虽然有时利用某种唯物主义观点，但是它终究只能畸形地片面地利用唯物主义；而越到近代，哲学上两大阵营的斗争就越加明显地反映着进步势力和反动势力的斗争。
    马克思主义不能承认这样的“公式”，好像在人类历史上，凡是革命者一定都是唯物主义者，而保守者一定都坚决地维护唯心主义。人们如果在研究哲学史的时候，竟以某些小册子中的粗糙定义为向导，那是十分有害的。
    所以，我们应当实事求是地分析各种唯物主义哲学和唯心主义哲学在具体的历史条件下起了什么作用和怎样地起这种作用。把哲学上的唯物主义和唯心主义直接等同于政治上的进步和保守，是过于简单的办法，我们应当拒绝这种办法。但是如果我们为反对这种简单办法而撇开唯物主义和唯心主义的区别，把唯物主义和唯心主义看成同样地是既可以为进步政治倾向服务，也可以为反动政治倾向服务，那么结果必然是只能导致在理论原则上混淆唯物主义和唯心主义的界限，模糊哲学的党性。    （未完）
