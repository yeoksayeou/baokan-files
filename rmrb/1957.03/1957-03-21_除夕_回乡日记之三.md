　　New Year's Eve
　　——Diary of Returning Home (3)
　　Lü Jianzhong
    My mother was staying at my aunt's house, so I went there for the Spring Festival.

    After getting off the bus, I walked through the courtyard by the river, where spring was just beginning to show, and the light purple peach branches smiled and leaned towards me. Climbing a small hill, the familiar mountain village unfolded before my eyes. Behind it lay a green mountain, and at its foot was a winding river. The clusters of houses, half-hidden and half-visible, were all topped with a pure white snow crown, like countless glittering pearls embedded in the light blue hillside in the brilliant sunset.

    The wilderness was very quiet. I couldn't quite distinguish whether the sound in my ear was the gurgling of the river or the voices of people coming from the opposite valley. I had no mind to enjoy these things, only wanting to step into my home. After entering the house, my mother was so excited that she didn't know what to say. My aunt was busy placing sacrificial offerings on the altar: two stacks of steamed buns in front, a pair of red candles, a plate of apples in the back, two plates of dried persimmons, and four bowls of cooked shredded radish covered with a few slices of fatty meat. My uncle smiled and explained to me, "This is just a formality. This year incense is expensive and candles are cheap. We didn't buy incense, but we bought a few more pairs of candles, because lighting candles saves lamp oil."

    Before long, my younger cousin ran back from outside and said, "I'm sorry, the agricultural cooperative is busy setting production increase plans and couldn't spare anyone to pick you up." I asked if the production increase plans had been set, and my cousin said, "No. Last year was the first year of the advanced cooperative, and we had no experience. We made some deviations in intercropping and close planting, which reduced production a bit, so this year the cooperative members insist on having a guarantee." I asked, "What kind of guarantee do the members want?" My cousin couldn't explain it clearly for a moment, and my aunt urged us to eat dinner.

    Dinner included fish, meat, cabbage with glass noodles, and Shandong white spirit. The steamed buns were made entirely of fine flour. My uncle said, even though last year's income was a little less than in the past, this year's Spring Festival is better than in previous years.

    After dinner, my cousin's neighbors all came over. Everyone talked about the matter of setting production increase plans in the agricultural cooperative. Later, I asked, "What kind of guarantee do the members want this year?"

    Everyone didn't answer me directly. After a moment of silence, one of my cousin's cousins brought up the matter of arguing with the cooperative cadres last year, which was caused by the intercropping of corn. The cooperative cadres went to the county for a meeting and brought back a set of plans: all the autumn crops in the cooperative would be closely planted and intercropped. My cousin's cousin and those members with farming experience raised different opinions, because the cooperative had both mountainous land and flat land. The soil was quite complex and should be adapted to local conditions. The cooperative cadres didn't adopt their suggestions and instead labeled the members with big hats. My cousin's cousin lost his temper and pointed at the cooperative director's nose, saying, "Didn't Chairman Mao teach you not to listen to the opinions of the masses? When I was farming, you were still crawling under the table!"

    In the autumn, sure enough, more than two hundred acres of hillside land in the cooperative were unsuitable for intercropping because of the soil quality and the lack of fertilizer and irrigation. The intercropped double-stalk corn only grew stalks and didn't produce ears.

    "Did the cooperative cadres learn a lesson?" I asked.

    "Last year, ever since the cooperative director argued with me, he turned his head and walked away when he saw me. After the autumn harvest, he changed, greeting me from afar. He probably knows in his heart that he was wrong."

    "It's not enough to just know in your heart! The first year of running the cooperative, it's okay to have a little deviation due to lack of experience, but this year, are they planning to correct it or not? We members have to have some idea!"

    From these words, I realized that what the members urgently demanded from running the cooperative was democracy. So I asked in a tentative tone, "If this year the cooperative cadres consult with you on everything and sincerely let the members offer ideas and find solutions, do you think the crops this year can be planted well?"

    Everyone gave a definite answer in unison, as if everyone had the same opinion on the problems in the cooperative. Then, my cousin's second uncle put down his pipe, his attitude was very serious, but also full of humor, and said, "Didn't you ask what kind of guarantee the members want? Isn't it this! To tell you the truth, the members have all heard a rumor that there are instructions from higher up that the cooperative's plans last year were too rigid and not practical, and that the cooperative cadres should apologize to the members and correct it this year. But the cooperative cadres haven't said anything yet, and the members have been waiting for many days!"

    "Heh, if he doesn't say anything after the Spring Festival, we'll give him a kick in the butt!"

      "Ha--"

      Everyone laughed, laughed very harmoniously, and the laughter made people feel a kind of hope, a kind of confidence.

    Suddenly, a burst of crackling firecrackers on the street told people that New Year's Eve had arrived.

    Everyone dispersed. This night, the whole village was immersed in a joyful and peaceful atmosphere. The elderly had not forgotten to silently burn incense and kowtow before their ancestors, praying for happiness for the whole family, while the young people beat gongs and drums, rehearsed dramas, and sang at the top of their voices. This sound surrounded, impacted, and formed a surging, unbridled force that enveloped the entire village. Everything decadent seemed to collapse and disappear in this flurry of sound….

　　除夕
　　——回乡日记之三
　　吕建中
    母亲寄居在姨母家，我也就到姨母家过春节了。
    下了汽车，我从河边那春色初露的院落走过，浅紫色的桃枝便微笑着向我探过头来。登上一个小山岗，那个熟悉的山村就展现在眼前了。背后横着一座青山，脚下是一条蜿蜒的河流，那一簇一簇半隐半现的人家的屋脊上，都顶着一朵洁白的雪冠，在灿烂的夕阳里像无数颗晶莹的珍珠镶嵌在那淡青色的山坡上。
    原野上十分宁静，耳边究竟是河里淙淙的流水声还是从对面山谷里传来的人语声，一时也分辨不清楚。我无心赏玩这些，只想一步跨进家门口。进屋以后，母亲激动得不知道说什么好，姨母在忙着往供桌上摆祭礼：前边两落饽饽，一对红蜡烛，后边摆一盘苹果，两盘柿饼，四碗表皮上盖着几片肥肉的熟萝卜丝。姨丈笑着向我解释道：“这只不过是个形式罢了。今年香贵，蜡烛便宜，没买香，只多买了几对蜡烛，因为点蜡烛就省下灯油了。”
    不一会，表弟从外面跑回来，说：“抱歉，农业社忙着订增产计划，腾不出身来去接您。”我问增产计划订好了没有，表弟说：“没有。去年头一年办高级社，没经验，在间种和密植上出了点偏差，减了点产，今年订计划社员就非要个把柄不可。”我又问：“社员想要什么把柄呢？”表弟一时没有说明白，姨母就催着吃晚饭了。
    晚饭有鱼、肉、有白菜粉丝，还有山东白干酒，馒头也纯是细面的。姨丈说，别看去年收入比过去减少了一点，今年春节却过得比往年强。
    吃过晚饭，表弟的邻居们都来了。大家谈农业社里订增产计划的事。后来我问道：“今年订计划，社员们到底想要个什么把柄？”
    大家没有正面回答我。沉默片刻，表弟的一个堂兄提起了去年和社干部吵架的事，那是因为社里间种玉米而引起的。社干部到县里开会，带回一套计划来：全社秋庄稼一律实行密植和间作，我表弟的堂兄和那些有耕作经验的社员都提出不同意见，因为社里有山地，也有平原地。土质挺复杂，应该因地制宜。社干部不采纳，反给社员扣了些大帽子。我表弟那堂兄发了火，指着社主任的鼻子道：“毛主席教您不听群众的意见吗？当初我种地的时候您还在桌子底下爬里！”
    到了秋天，果然，社里二百多亩山坡地因为土质不相宜，肥料和水利又跟不上，间种的双株玉米光长秸子不出穗，瞎了。
    “社干部接受教训了没有？”我问。
    “去年自从社主任和我吵了架，他见了我的面把头一拧就过去了；秋收以后，变了，见了我老远就打招呼。他心里兴许知道自己错了。”
    “光心里知道不行啊！头一年办社，没经验，出点小偏差算啥，可是今年，他们到底打算不打算纠正，总得叫咱社员心里有个底啊！”
    从这些话里，我觉察出社员们对办社迫切要求的是民主了。于是我便用试探的口气问道：“如果今年社干部不论什么事都同您们商量，都真心实意地让社员们出主意，想办法，您们看今年的庄稼能不能种好？”
    大家同声做了肯定的回答，好像每个人对社里的问题都已经有了不约而同的见解。接着，我表弟的二伯父放下烟管，态度很郑重，但又满有风趣地说：“您不是问社员们到底想要个什么把柄吗？还不就是这个！不瞒您说，社员们都听了个风儿，说上级有指示，去年社里的计划太死，不大合乎实际，叫社干部向社员们检讨，今年一定纠正过来。可是社干部一直还没吭声，社员们等了不少的日子啦！”
    “嘻，过了春节他要是再不吭声，咱就在他屁股上给加一把火！”
      “哈——”
      大家都笑了，笑得很和谐，笑声里使人感到有一种希望，一种信心。
    突然，大街上一阵毕毕剥剥的爆竹声，告诉人们，除夕之夜来临了。
    大家散去了。这一夜，全村沉浸在欢乐而宁静的气氛中。老年人还没有忘记在祖先面前默然焚香、叩头，为全家祈祷幸福，而年轻人则敲锣打鼓，排演戏剧，拉开喉咙歌唱。这声响从四面八方围拢着，冲击着，形成一种奔腾无羁的力量笼罩着全村，一切陈腐的东西仿佛都在这繁响里溃散、消失……。
