On Strengthening Healthcare for School-Age Children
Chen Cuizhen Proposes Three Measures

Now I would like to share my personal opinions on the issue of children's healthcare.

In the past few years, the focus of children's healthcare work was initially on prenatal and newborn care, and then gradually expanded to infant and toddler care, achieving certain results. The national infant mortality rate has generally decreased, and the incidence of some acute infectious diseases in children, such as diphtheria, has significantly reduced. However, the prevalence of other infectious diseases, such as pertussis and measles, has not been well controlled, and some issues in this regard remain to be resolved. However, what I want to talk about today is not these aspects, but a part of children's healthcare work that has not been given enough attention so far, namely, the healthcare of school-age children. These children, aged 7-14, account for over 10% of China's total population, and 60% of them are already primary school students. By the end of the first Five-Year Plan, this number could reach 90% (60 million primary school students), so this issue is essentially the health issue of primary school students. According to reports from relevant parties regarding school hygiene in primary schools, both the health of primary school students and school hygiene have serious problems. According to surveys, 50% of students in some schools are nearsighted, and over 17% have spinal deformities such as scoliosis. Some survey data indicate that over 20% of primary school students have dental caries, and over 10% suffer from malnutrition, while trachoma and ascariasis are even more prevalent.

The material conditions in general primary schools are very poor. Classrooms are small and overcrowded, leading to congestion and insufficient lighting (both natural and artificial), as well as poor air circulation. This makes it easy for infectious diseases to spread and may also affect eyesight, contributing to nearsightedness. It also affects students' concentration and thinking ability, hindering their learning. The height of desks and chairs in classrooms often does not meet the needs of each child's height, leading to spinal deformities such as hunchback.

According to the joint notice issued in 1954 by the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, and the All-China Sports Federation, universities should have school medical offices, and middle schools should have infirmaries, but primary schools do not have dedicated personnel responsible. They only have first-aid kits managed by "health teachers." However, health teachers are neither medical personnel nor full-time cadres, and they are frequently replaced. Therefore, the health of school-age children has not improved in recent years. The 7-14 age group is an important stage in the growth and development of school-age children, and it is also an important stage for laying the foundation for lifelong health. Therefore, the healthcare of school-age children and school hygiene work are very important. However, currently, no specific person or organization is concerned with this matter. On the one hand, this is because our generation of adults has not given due attention to children of this age group; on the other hand, there is a lack of specialized personnel to carry out this important work. Medical education institutions have not trained a large number of pediatricians and nursing staff in the past and present, so children's healthcare work cannot be carried out comprehensively and extensively, which seriously affects children's health and the development and growth of the new generation. This situation must be reversed to achieve the "three-good" requirements of "good health, good learning, and good work." However, this work is arduous and long-term.

To carry out children's healthcare work in primary schools, I propose the following measures:

1.  Tap potential and start with the principle of regional responsibility. The implementation and leadership can be the responsibility of the children's health clinics. In areas where there are no children's health clinics, the maternal and child health clinics or the pediatric departments of general hospitals can temporarily be responsible for leadership. In terms of specific work, medical workers in the area can also be called upon as a form of voluntary labor, so that this work can be launched and carried out under the principle of increasing production and practicing economy.

2.  For long-term planning, a certain number of specialized personnel—pediatricians and nurses—must be trained to achieve the goal of one pediatrician for every 6,000 children and one nurse for every 3,000 children. In rural areas, health workers can be temporarily trained, calculated at one health worker for every 600 school-age children. The Ministry of Health can plan and stipulate how many doctors and nurses are needed nationwide each year for the development of this children's healthcare work, and then assign the responsibility for training to medical colleges and universities across the country. The training of pediatricians can be done in the following ways: Establish pediatric departments in medical colleges and universities with the conditions to specialize in training pediatricians. For the shortfall, a certain number of pediatricians can be trained from medical students, with a focus on pediatric internships during the clinical practice phase. Similarly, pediatric healthcare nurses can be trained by existing nursing schools, cultivating the required number of nurses.

3.  Encourage the attention of relevant departments and personnel, and incorporate school hygiene and the healthcare of school-age children into the work plan. For example, the Ministry of Education should regard children's healthcare as an organic and important part of children's overall development, and while inspecting children's education work, also inspect the health status of children and the implementation of healthcare work. The funds required for children's healthcare work in primary schools should also be appropriately arranged in its operational expenditure budget. The health department should pay more attention to the healthcare of school-age children. This is an important link in the entire healthcare cause and is indispensable for the normal and perfect development of children's physical and mental health. The lack of healthcare for school-age children in the healthcare cause is unsatisfactory.

We often say that children are the flowers of the motherland, the continuers of mankind, and the successors to socialist construction. Therefore, we loudly appeal here, hoping that children's health issues can receive the attention and support they deserve. China is launching family planning work, and in the future, the birth rate will inevitably decrease, and the number of children will decrease. Therefore, we must do a good job in children's healthcare so that our children can enjoy the joy of health and grow into healthy people, preparing to participate in the construction of the country.

The above opinions are not comprehensive enough and not mature enough. I hope the members will give criticism and corrections. (Attached picture)

### 加强学龄儿童的保健工作　陈翠贞提出三项办法

　　加强学龄儿童的保健工作
　　陈翠贞提出三项办法
    现在就儿童保健问题谈谈我个人的意见。
    过去几年内，儿童保健工作的重点最初是放在胎儿和新生儿保健，随后又逐步开展了婴幼儿保健，并且已获得了一定的成果，全国婴儿死亡率已普遍下降，有些小儿急性传染病的发病率如白喉已显著降低。但是另外一些传染病如百日咳、麻疹等的流行还未能很好地控制，这方面的一些问题尚待解决。然而我今天要谈的并非这些，我所要谈的是到目前为止尚未被重视的儿童保健工作的一部分，也就是学龄儿童的保健。这些7—14岁的儿童占我国总人口的10％强，而其中60％现在已经是小学校的学生。到第一个五年计划之末，这个数字可达到90％（6，000万小学生），因此这问题也就是小学生的健康问题。小学校的学校卫生问题，根据有关方面的反映，小学生的健康和学校卫生都存在着严重的问题，根据调查有些学校的学生50％是近视眼，17％以上有脊柱弯曲的畸形。某些调查资料说明20％强的小学生有龋齿，10％以上有营养不良，而砂眼和蛔虫症就更普遍了。
    一般小学校的物质条件很差，课室小而学生多，不但拥挤而且照明（无论是日光或灯光）不足，空气流通亦不畅。因而传染病易于传播，亦可能影响视力而促成近视眼症，同时也影响学生的集中力和思考能力，妨碍了学生的学习。课室里桌椅的高低，常不符合于每个儿童身材的需要而造成驼背等脊柱畸形。
    按1954年高教部、教育部、卫生部和全国体协发出的联合通知所指定的大学有校医处，中学有医务室，而小学则没有专人负责，只设有保健箱，由“卫生老师”负责，而卫生老师既不是医务卫生人员，也不是专职干部，还经常调换，因此几年来学龄儿童的健康情况未见有所改善。7—14岁的学龄儿童正处于发育成长过程中的一个重要阶段，也是人生打下健康基础的重要阶段。因此，学龄儿童的保健和学校卫生工作非常重要。但是目前还没有专人或机关过问这事，一方面是由于我们这一代的成人对这年龄的儿童未给予应有的重视，另一方面是缺乏专门人员来执行这项重要工作，医学教育机关过去和现在都还没有培养大量的儿科医师和护理人员，以致儿童保健工作不能全面的广泛的开展，严重的影响到儿童的健康，影响到新一代的发育成长。这种情况必须设法扭转，才能达到“身体好、学习好、工作好”的三好要求。但是这项工作是艰巨的也是长期的。
    为开展小学校内的儿童保健工作，我提出下列几项办法：
    1，挖掘潜力，采用地区负责制的原则着手进行，其实施领导可由儿童保健所负责，地区内没有儿童保健所的可暂由妇幼保健所或综合医院的儿科部门负责领导，具体工作上还可号召所在地区的医务工作人员作为义务劳动的一种，使这项工作能在增产节约的原则下发动开展。
    2．为长远计划打算，须培养一定数量的专门人员——儿科医师和护士，达到每6，000名儿童有一名儿科医师，每3，000儿童一名护士的目标，在乡村地区暂时可培养保健员，以每600名学龄儿童有一个保健员计算，全国逐年为这项儿童保健工作的开展需要多少医师护士，可由卫生部计划规定而后交全国各医学院校负责培养。儿童医师的培养可通过以下的办法：在有条件的医学院校建立儿科系，专事培养儿科医师，其不敷之数，可由医疗系学生培养一定数量的儿科医师，用生产实习阶段重点实习儿科。同样的，儿科保健护士可由现有的护士学校培养，培养所需数量的护士。
    3．促成有关部门及人员的注意，将小学校卫生和学龄儿童的保健工作纳入事业计划之内。如教育部应将儿童保健工作看成是儿童全面发展的有机和重要部分，在检查儿童教育工作的同时，也检查儿童的健康情况和保健工作执行的情况。小学校儿童保健工作所需的经费亦应在其事业费预算中作适当的布置，卫生部门更应重视学龄儿童的保健工作。这是整个保健事业中的重要一环，为儿童身心正常完善的发育所不可缺的。卫生事业中没有学龄儿童保健是不能令人满意的。
    我们常说：儿童是祖国的花朵，是人类的延续者，是社会主义建设的接班人，因此我们在此大声呼吁，希望儿童的健康问题能得到它应得的注意和支持。我国正在展开节制生育工作，在今后的一定的时期，出生率势必降低，儿童人口的数字将有所减少，因此我们更要把儿童保健工作做好，使我们的儿童能够享受健康的乐趣，成长为健康的人，为参加国家的建设事业作好准备。
    以上的意见考虑不够全面也不够成熟，希望各位委员赐以批评指正。（附图片）
