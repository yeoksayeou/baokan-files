To more fully unleash the socialist enthusiasm of women.

The fundamental end of class exploitation and the basic establishment of the socialist system in our country have eradicated the roots of the oppression of women for thousands of years, creating the most superior social conditions for the cause of women's liberation. Women of all ethnic groups in our country are heartened by this and have devoted themselves to the socialist transformation and construction with unparalleled enthusiasm, making significant contributions. In all aspects of the cause of women's liberation, unprecedented and enormous achievements have been made.

In 1956, the number of female workers and staff participating in various sectors of the national economy, medical and health services, culture and education, and state organs was roughly estimated to have increased to about three million. The number of female laborers in agricultural production cooperatives increased to over 111 million, and the number of female members in handicraft production cooperatives reached more than 1.5 million. They were diligent and thrifty, actively engaged in labor and production, worked and studied hard, practiced strict economy, and achieved excellent results. Women in the families of the broad masses of workers and staff strived to achieve "five goods" and actively participated in social activities. Female industrialists and merchants and family members of industrialists and merchants worked hard to transform themselves into self-reliant laborers. A large number of advanced female figures have emerged on all fronts, with the number of women among advanced producers (workers) increasing to 270,000.

Many outstanding women have been selected for leadership positions in various jobs. In urban neighborhood committees, female cadres account for about 80% of the total number of cadres. Many provinces and counties have basically realized the call for "every township to have a female township head, and every cooperative to have a female cooperative head." In Shanxi, Guangxi, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, Henan, Sichuan and other provinces, about 80% of the townships and cooperatives have female township heads and cooperative heads. In the 1956 grassroots elections, according to incomplete statistics from 25 provinces and autonomous regions, the proportion of women elected as grassroots people's representatives has increased from 17% in 1953 to 22.5%.

Women enthusiastically marched towards culture, technology, and science. More than 30 million women participated in literacy campaigns, and many women have escaped illiteracy and enriched their cultural and scientific knowledge. Many female medical and health workers, educators, cultural and artistic workers, and scientific workers worked hard, labored diligently, and served the people. When the Chinese Academy of Sciences awarded the 1956 Science Prizes, three female scientists received awards.

Facts have proven that only the socialist system can highly unleash the intelligence and talent of women, demonstrate the great strength of women, and enable women to become useful talents in society; only the socialist system can fundamentally guarantee that women gradually obtain rights that are completely equal to those of men.

However, due to the relatively backward state of our economy and culture, and due to the ineffective implementation and insufficient experience in implementing policies on equality between men and women and protection of women and children in various aspects, there are still many difficulties facing women. For example, the ideas and customs of looking down on and discriminating against women left over from the old society are still quite prevalent and are reflected to varying degrees in people's treatment of women, children, marriage, and family. The majority of women are still illiterate. Most of the women who have already participated in social labor do not have high professional skills or sufficient experience, and many of the special difficulties in their lives have not yet been resolved. In order to overcome these difficulties, we must continue to work hard to change the backward state of our economy and culture and build our country into an advanced socialist industrial power, creating more superior social conditions for further achieving complete equality between men and women; at the same time, we must strive to implement the policies of equality between men and women and protection of women and children in all aspects, focusing on helping women improve their political and ideological level, master cultural and scientific knowledge, improve labor productivity and work skills, and reduce the unique difficulties faced by women.

In commemorating this year's "March 8th" International Women's Day, it is the responsibility of Party organizations, state organs, and people's organizations to encourage women to serve socialist construction with confidence and high spirits, and to guide women to more fully unleash their socialist enthusiasm in the current increase production and practice economy movement, and to create greater achievements. To this end, we must first pay regular attention to conducting political and ideological education among women, and constantly improve their communist consciousness. At present, we must pay special attention to educating women to love socialism and love the collective, to build the country and manage their families with diligence and thrift, and to treat the difficulties encountered on the road of socialist construction with patriotism. We must fight for the full realization of women's legitimate rights, and at the same time, we must educate women to deeply understand that a happy life and a completely equal status between men and women can only be gradually achieved through women's own hard work. It is incorrect to be unwilling to work hard, to look down on physical labor, to be uneasy about agricultural production, or even to try to pursue material enjoyment through love and marriage, and this should be criticized.

We must widely publicize the principles of communist thought in treating women, children, marriage, and family to women and all sectors of society, and advocate further establishing a social atmosphere of equality between men and women in all aspects of society and in families. At present, the communist moral thinking of the people of our country is growing, and more and more people are able to treat women, children, family, and marriage issues according to communist principles. Whether in cities or villages, happy marriages and harmonious families have already taken the upper hand. However, the old ideas of valuing men over women left over from the old society and the old habits that destroy or harm the physical and mental health of women and children still exist, and we must continue to work hard to change these old ideas and old habits and promote new ideas and new habits.

Second, while further unleashing women's enthusiasm for labor, we must pay attention to protecting the safety and health of women and children. People are the most valuable asset, and women are not only the labor force in various construction undertakings, but also the motherhood that nurtures human offspring. In labor, it is only natural to take care of their dual responsibilities and the difficulties arising therefrom. Last year, in the agricultural production increase movement and the urban advanced producer movement, some places did not take good care of women's housework and did not pay sufficient attention to protecting the safety and health of women and children, resulting in some casualties among women and children, and the proportion of miscarriages and premature births among pregnant women once increased. In carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement this year, all localities must learn from this lesson. On the one hand, we must educate women to cherish their own health, so as to do a good job in production, work, housework, and health. At the same time, the relevant leaders must strive to implement production safety measures and insist on running the necessary and possible women and children's welfare undertakings. The existing nurseries and kindergartens in organs and enterprises should improve their operations, improve work efficiency, and overcome formalism, ostentation, and all practices that deviate from the masses in the spirit of diligence and thrift; absorb the experience created by mass nurseries in this regard in recent years, and actively develop childcare undertakings, so as to solve the difficulties for female workers, staff, and cooperative members who are currently urgently requesting to entrust their children.

In order to better protect the health of mothers and infants, in order to better educate children, and in order to make family life happier, the people urgently demand birth control. We should gradually meet the needs of the masses and appropriately advocate birth control throughout the country, except in minority areas, publicize to both men and women that they should plan their children according to their own conditions and according to their own wishes, and adjust the density of births. Persuade them to adopt current effective and harmless contraceptive methods, and persuade them not to be afraid of trouble and not to take abortion pills indiscriminately.

Third, we must train a large number of female backbones in various jobs and activities. We must cherish and support the existing female backbones, help them overcome difficulties, improve their political and ideological level, enrich their knowledge, delve deeply into their work, and truly be able to lead the men and women comrades around them to advance together. All organs, organizations, and cooperatives that have not been equipped with a certain number of female cadres should boldly select female backbones. Party organizations, state organs, and people's organizations should take the training of female backbones as a part of cadre work and conduct it regularly and in a planned manner.

The most important thing for women's liberation is to rely on women's own struggle. In addition to the continued efforts of Party organizations, state organs, and people's organizations to implement the policies of equality between men and women and protection of women and children, women who have already participated in social labor must work hard, be diligent and thrifty, and study hard in their current positions; housewives must continue to implement the "five goods" and actively participate in social activities. The organizations of the All-China Women's Federation at all levels should take the initiative to actively and practically do a good job in women's work, strive to realize the correct demands of the women, organize the women to conduct self-education, encourage the women's desire to improve, and mobilize the women to solve difficulties by means of mutual assistance and cooperation. The staff of the Women's Federation must closely contact the women of all ethnic groups and strata, be familiar with the thoughts and aspirations of the women, share weal and woe with the broad masses of women, and lead them to move forward firmly on the road of socialism. The working women of our country have a fine tradition of diligence, thrift, and hard work. We hope that women across the country will carry forward this tradition, implement the spirit of building the country diligently and thriftily and managing their families diligently and thriftily, and work together with the people of the whole country to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year, strive to successfully complete the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy in our country, and welcome the second five-year plan; and strive to further establish a new moral fashion of recognizing equality between men and women and protecting women and children.

### 更充分地发挥妇女群众的社会主义积极性

    更充分地发挥妇女群众的社会主义积极性
    我国阶级剥削制度的基本结束，社会主义制度的基本建立，铲除了几千年来妇女被压迫的根源，为妇女解放事业创造了最优越的社会条件。我国各族妇女为此欢欣鼓舞，用无比的热情投入了社会主义改造和建设事业，做出了重大的贡献。在妇女解放事业的各方面，获得了前所未有的巨大成就。
    1956年参加国民经济各部门、医务卫生、文化教育、国家机关工作的女工、女职员据初步估算，约增至三百万人左右，农业生产合作社的女劳动力增加到一亿一千多万人，手工业生产合作社的女社员达到一百五十多万人。她们克勤克俭，积极劳动生产，努力工作、学习，厉行节约，创造了优良的成绩。广大职工家庭中的妇女，努力实现“五好”，积极参加社会活动。女工商业者和工商业者家属努力改造自己成为自食其力的劳动者。各个战线上都涌现了成批的妇女先进人物，仅先进生产（工作）者中的妇女已增至二十七万人。
    许多优秀的妇女被选拔到各种工作的领导岗位上。在城市居民委员会中，女干部占干部总数的80％左右。不少省、县已经基本上实现了“乡乡有女乡长，社社有女社长”的号召。山西、广西、河北、黑龙江、浙江、河南、四川等省，80％左右的乡和社有了正、副女乡长和女社长。1956年基层选举中，据二十五个省、自治区不完全的统计，当选为基层人民代表的妇女占代表总数的比例，已由1953年的17％上升为22.5％。
    妇女们热情地向文化、技术、科学进军。三千多万妇女参加了扫除文盲的学习，不少妇女脱离了文盲状态，充实了文化科学知识。许多女的医务卫生工作者、教育工作者、文化艺术工作者、科学工作者，勤学苦练，艰苦劳动，为人民服务。中国科学院颁发1956年科学奖金时，有三位女科学家得奖。
    事实证明，只有社会主义制度，才能高度发挥妇女的聪明才智，显示妇女的巨大力量，使妇女成为社会上有用的人才；只有社会主义制度才能从根本上保障妇女逐步取得和男子完全平等的权利。
    但是由于我国经济、文化依然比较落后，由于各方面对男女平等、保护妇女儿童的政策贯彻执行不力，经验不足，摆在妇女群众面前的困难还是不少的。例如旧社会遗留下来的轻视、歧视妇女的思想习俗，仍旧相当普遍地程度不同地反映在人们对待妇女、儿童、婚姻、家庭的各个方面。大多数妇女还处在文盲状态。已经参加社会劳动的妇女，多数的业务水平还不高，经验还不足，生活上特殊的困难还有很多没有解决。为了克服这些困难，必须继续努力，改变我国经济和文化的落后状态，把我国建设成为先进的社会主义工业国，为进一步实现男女完全平等创造更优越的社会条件；同时要从各方面努力贯彻执行男女平等、保护妇女儿童的政策，着重帮助妇女提高政治思想水平，掌握文化、科学知识，提高劳动生产率和工作熟练程度，减少妇女特有的困难。
    在纪念今年“三八”国际妇女节的时候，党组织、国家机关和人民团体的责任，是要鼓励妇女满怀信心地、精神饱满地为社会主义建设服务，引导妇女在当前增产节约运动中更加充分地发挥社会主义积极性，创造更大的成就。为此首先要经常注意对妇女进行政治思想教育工作，不断地提高她们的共产主义觉悟。在目前要特别注意教育妇女热爱社会主义，热爱集体，以克勤克俭的精神建国治家，以爱国主义的精神对待在社会主义建设道路上所遇到的一些困难。要为充分实现妇女的合法权利而斗争，同时要教育妇女深刻地认识：幸福的生活、男女完全平等的地位，要依靠妇女自身的艰苦劳动才能逐步取得。不愿艰苦地劳动，轻视体力劳动，不安心于农业生产，甚至想通过恋爱婚姻来达到追求物质享受的目的，这都是不正确的，应当加以批判。
    要向妇女、向社会各方面广泛宣传用共产主义思想原则对待妇女、儿童、婚姻、家庭，提倡在社会各方面及家庭中进一步树立男女平等的风气。目前，我国人民的共产主义道德思想正在成长，有越来越多的人能够根据共产主义的原则对待妇女、儿童、家庭、婚姻问题。不论城市或乡村，美满的婚姻，和睦的家庭，都已经占了优势。但是旧社会遗留下来的重男轻女的旧思想，摧残或损害妇女儿童身心健康的旧习惯仍然存在，必须继续努力转变这些旧思想旧习惯，提倡新思想新习惯。
    第二，在进一步发挥妇女劳动积极性的同时，要注意保护妇女儿童的安全和健康。人是最宝贵的财产，妇女既是各种建设事业中的劳动力，又是孕育人类后代的母性。在劳动中，照顾她们担负的两重职责及由此产生的困难，是理所当然的事情。去年在农业增产运动及城市先进生产者运动中，有些地方没有很好地照顾妇女的家务劳动，没有充分注意保护妇女、儿童的安全和健康，以致发生了若干妇女儿童的伤亡事故，孕妇流产早产的比例一度增长。今年各地在开展增产节约运动中，必须吸取这个教训。一方面，要教育妇女爱护自身的健康，做到生产好，工作好，家务好，身体好。同时，有关领导方面要努力贯彻生产安全措施，并坚持举办必须而又可能举办的妇女儿童福利事业。现有的机关、企业的托儿所、幼儿园，要本着克勤克俭的精神，改进业务，提高工作效率，克服崇尚形式、讲究排场及一切脱离群众的作法；吸收近几年来群众性托儿组织在这方面创造的经验，积极发展儿童保育事业，为目前正在迫切要求寄托子女的女工、女职员、女社员解决困难。
    为了更好地保护妇婴健康，为了更好地教养子女，为了家庭生活过得更加幸福，人民群众迫切要求节制生育。应当逐步满足群众的要求，在全国范围内，除少数民族地区外，适当地提倡节制生育，向男女双方宣传按照自身的条件，根据自己的愿望，有计划地生育子女，调节生育密度。劝导他们采用当前行之有效的并对身体无害的避孕办法，说服他们不要怕麻烦，不要乱吃堕胎药。
    第三，在各种工作和各项活动中，要大量培养妇女骨干。要爱护和支持现有的妇女骨干，帮助她们克服困难，提高政治思想水平，充实知识，深入钻研业务，真正能带领周围的男女同志一齐前进。凡是没有配备一定数量女干部的机关、团体、合作社，要大胆地选拔女骨干。党的组织、国家机关和人民团体要把培养妇女骨干作为干部工作的一部分，经常地有计划地进行。
    妇女解放最重要地是依靠妇女自身的奋斗。除了党组织、国家机关、人民团体继续努力贯彻执行男女平等、保护妇女儿童的政策外，已参加社会劳动的妇女，要在现在的岗位上，克勤克俭，艰苦劳动，努力学习；家庭妇女要继续贯彻“五好”，积极参加社会活动。中华全国民主妇女联合会的各级组织，应当主动地积极地切切实实地做好妇女工作，努力实现妇女群众的正确要求，组织妇女群众进行自我教育，鼓舞妇女的上进心，发动妇女群众用互助合作的方法解决困难。妇联的工作人员，必须密切联系各族各阶层妇女群众，熟悉妇女群众的思想和愿望，跟广大群众同甘共苦，带领她们坚定不移地在社会主义道路上迈进。我国劳动妇女是有勤劳节俭、艰苦朴素的优良传统的。我们希望全国妇女发扬这种传统，贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭治家的精神，同全国人民在一起，为争取今年农业大丰收，争取圆满地完成我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，迎接第二个五年计划而努力；为进一步树立承认男女平等、保护妇女儿童的新的道德风尚而努力。
