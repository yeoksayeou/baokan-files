    According to this newspaper, when planning this year's production, the Huale No. 1 Agricultural Cooperative in Jinning County, Yunnan Province, and the Dapo Agricultural Cooperative in Songming County paid attention to mobilizing the masses for discussion, which resulted in the following: production targets increased as they went down, production projects became more diverse as they went down, and measures to ensure increased production became more numerous and practical as they went down. Before this, there were some contradictions between cooperative cadres and the masses. Cadres could not think of or dared not mobilize the masses because they feared "making promises too big and not being able to deliver," so they "would rather set lower targets"; as far as the members were concerned, they thought, "Planning or not planning, only the cooperative cadres know anyway, we are only responsible for going to work and getting work points." Later, after mobilizing the masses for repeated discussions at each level and summarizing the good experiences of last year, everyone came up with ideas, and the targets were generally raised compared to the original ones. The Huale No. 1 Cooperative originally planned to increase rice production by only 9.38%, and set targets to maintain the production of corn, miscellaneous grains, etc. After discussion by the masses, more than thirty measures, large and small, were proposed. The results were: rice production could be increased by 17.87%, corn production by 104%, several kinds of miscellaneous grains by more than 30%, and economic crops by 78.8%; the number of pigs raised by the cooperative was increased from 150 to 200, and the number of pigs raised by each household was increased from one to one and a half; the number of chickens raised by each household was increased from nine to twelve; several production activities such as beekeeping, which had been omitted, were also included in the plan. In this way, the average per capita total output value increased from the original plan of 97 yuan to 168 yuan, with a net grain distribution of 802 jin. Similarly, after repeated discussions, the Dapo Cooperative appropriately increased the unit yield of various crops and added more projects. The experience of the two cooperatives proves that mobilizing the masses to plan production can both combine leadership with the masses and avoid the bias of either imposing tasks from above or the cooperative cadres not daring to lead, resulting in laissez-faire.

    In planning production, the two cooperatives also included household sideline occupations in the cooperative's plan. This not only encouraged the production enthusiasm of the members, but also discovered great potential. However, when planning began, the cooperative cadres did not dare to plan household sideline occupations for fear of disrupting collective management. The experience of planning proves that appropriately taking care of individuals under the premise of obeying collective management and not harming or benefiting the enthusiasm of the collective, with the cooperative comprehensively planning labor and including household sideline occupations in the cooperative's plan, is beneficial to resolving contradictions. After unified planning, the output value of household sideline occupations in the two cooperatives increased significantly. Dapo Cooperative increased by 65.4% compared to last year, with each person able to earn 23.8 yuan, equivalent to half a year's worth of grain rations converted into money; Huale No. 1 Cooperative also increased by 134% compared to last year.

    In addition, the experience of these two cooperatives in mobilizing the masses to plan production also proves that letting members participate in the management and leadership of the cooperative not only eliminates some of the contradictions between cooperative cadres and members, but also educates members to rely on their own labor to develop production and improve their lives, and combines long-term interests with current interests, and also comprehensively arranges production.

### 云南省两个农业社的经验证明　只有发动群众才能订好计划

　　云南省两个农业社的经验证明
　　只有发动群众才能订好计划
    本报讯  云南省晋宁县化乐第一农业社和嵩明县大坡农业社在规划今年生产的时候，注意了发动群众讨论，出现了这样的情况：生产指标越往下越高，生产项目越往下越丰富，保证增产的措施越往下越多越踏实。在这以前，社干部和群众之间存在着一些矛盾。干部想不到或不敢去发动群众，他们怕“愿许大了，做不到打嘴巴”，所以“宁肯订得低一些”；而在社员来说，则认为“规划不规划，反正只有社干部知道，我们只管出工拿工分”。后来经过发动群众逐级反复讨论，总结了去年的好经验，大家想办法，指标一般都比原来的提高了。化乐一社原来规划稻谷只增加9.38％，其它苞谷、杂粮等都订保产。经过群众讨论，就提出了三十多条大小措施。结果是：稻谷能增产17.87％，苞谷增产104％，几种杂粮增产30％以上，经济作物增产78.8％；养猪由原来社养一百五十头增加到二百头，家庭养猪由每户一头增加到一头半；养鸡每户由九只增加到十二只；被漏掉的养蜂等几种生产也列入了计划。这样，每人平均生产总值由原计划九十七元增加到一百六十八元，纯分粮八百零二斤。大坡社同样地经过反复讨论后，各项作物的单位产量都适当地提高了，项目也增加了。两个社的经验证明：发动群众规划生产，既能作到领导与群众相结合，又能避免发生从上往下硬派任务或社干部不敢领导造成放任自流的偏向。
    在规划生产中，这两个社还把家庭副业纳入了社的计划。不仅鼓舞了社员的生产积极性，而且还发现潜力很大。但在开始规划的时候，社干部不敢规划家庭副业，怕冲掉了集体经营。规划的经验证明：在服从集体经营、不妨害或有利于集体的积极性之下，适当地照顾个人，由社全面规划劳动力，把家庭副业纳入社的规划，反而有利于解决矛盾。这两个社经过统一规划后，家庭副业的产值就都有了很大的增加。大坡社比去年增加65.4％，每人可收入二十三元八角，相当于半年口粮折合的钱；化乐一社，也比去年增加了134％。
    此外，这两个社发动群众规划生产的经验还证明：放手让社员参与社的管理和领导，不仅可以消除社干部和社员之间存在的一些矛盾，还可以教育社员依靠自己的劳动去发展生产改善生活，并把长远利益和目前利益结合起来，也可以全面地安排生产。
