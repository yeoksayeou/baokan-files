Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 23rd. Xinhua News Agency reporter Shao Tingjun and Wang Huandou reported: The investigation results of the郫县(Pi County) Committee of the Chinese Communist Party prove that the saying "If you take care of the work, you can't take care of the production; if you become a cooperative cadre, you can only reduce your income" is incorrect. As long as the working methods are appropriate, the cooperative cadres can also increase their income.

After the year-end distribution work of the agricultural cooperatives in this county last year, many of the main cadres of the cooperatives said: Being a cadre affects production and reduces income. Therefore, everyone's work enthusiasm is not high. In order to correctly solve this problem, recently, the Pi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized seven county committee members who frequently go to the countryside, and went to agricultural cooperatives with advanced, average, or backward work, and talked and held discussions with fifty cooperative cadres to conduct investigations. The investigation results found two situations.

One situation is that the cooperative cadres' working methods are appropriate, and they are good at combining work and participation in production. They not only do their work well, but also ensure that their income is not lower than that of the members of the cooperative with the same labor force. For example, Liu Guangcai, the director of a cooperative in Gucheng Township, led the cadres of the entire cooperative to reasonably divide the work, and each cadre went to one or two production teams to participate in production and assist the team leader in his work. In this way, the work was done well (last year, the rice yield of this cooperative reached the advanced level in the county), and the cooperative cadres also increased their income because they participated in production. Liu Guangcai himself did 180 workdays last year, plus 35 workdays subsidized by the cooperative, with a total annual income of 189 yuan.

Another situation is that the cooperative cadres' working methods have problems. Not only is their own income reduced, but also their work is not done well. For example, Zhou Xilin, the director of a cooperative in Heping Township, busily "grabbed all the work at once" all day long. He either sat in the office giving orders or held meetings everywhere. He was too lazy to participate in production even when he had free time. Not only did he fail to do his work well, but his personal income was also not high. He only did 20 workdays in a year, plus 40 workdays subsidized, earning only more than 50 yuan, and his family life was difficult. The members of the cooperative also had opinions about him.

After the investigation by the Pi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at the mobilization meeting for spring plowing and production in the county, the above two typical examples were announced to more than 1,000 main cadres of agricultural cooperatives, and everyone was organized to discuss them. After discussion, these cadres all realized that they must closely combine work and production in order to do their work well and increase their own income. After returning to the cooperatives, they all improved their leadership methods in conjunction with the preparatory work for plowing. The person in charge of the Communist Party branch of the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Hexing Township, after going to a backward team to assist in the work, did many workdays himself, and also helped this team win the cooperative's competition red flag recently.

In order to ensure that cooperative cadres participate in production to lead production and ensure that their income is not lower than that of ordinary cooperative members, the Pi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to start by streamlining meetings and preventing cadres from holding too many concurrent positions, so that each cooperative cadre has at least 200 days of time to participate in production this year.

    郫县农业社干部认识了参加生产的重要
　　今年每人至少有二百天能参加生产
    新华社成都23日电　新华社记者邵挺军、王焕斗报道：中共四川省郫县县委会调查结果证明：“顾了工作，顾不了生产；当了社干部，就只好减少收入”的说法是不对的，只要工作方法得当，社干部同样可以增加收入。
    这个县的农业社去年年终分配工作结束后，许多社的主要干部说：当了干部，影响生产，收入减少了。因此大家工作情绪不高。为了正确地解决这个问题，最近，中共郫县县委会组织七个经常下乡的县委委员，分头到工作先进、一般或落后的农业社里，找了五十个社干部谈话和座谈，进行调查。调查结果发现有两种情况。
    一种是社干部工作方法得当，善于把工作和参加生产结合起来，既做好了工作，又保证自己的收益不比同等劳力的社员低。如古城乡一个社的社主任刘光才，领导全社干部合理分工，每个社干部分头下到一个或两个生产队，一面参加生产，一面协助队长工作。这样，工作也做好了（去年这个社的水稻产量达到了全县的先进水平），社干部因为参加生产，收入也增多了。刘光才本人去年就做了一百八十个劳动日，加上社内给他补助的三十五个劳动日，全年收入一百八十九元。
    另一种情况是社干部工作方法有毛病，不仅自己的收入减少了，而且工作也没有做好。如和平乡一个社的社主任周锡林，整天忙忙乱乱地把工作“一把抓起来”，不是坐在办公室里发号施令，就是到处召开会议，有闲也懒得参加生产。既没把工作搞好，个人的收入又不多，一年只做了二十个劳动日，加上补助的四十个劳动日，才收入五十多元，家庭生活困难，社员对他还有意见。
    中共郫县县委会调查之后，在全县春耕生产动员大会上向一千多名农业社的主要干部宣布了上述两种典型事例，并且组织大家讨论。经过讨论，这些干部都认识到必须把工作和生产密切结合起来，才能做好工作，增加自己的收入。他们回到社里，都结合备耕工作，改进了领导方法。合兴乡红光农业社中共分支部负责人，下到一个落后队里协助工作以后，本人做了许多劳动日，还帮助这个队在最近夺得了社里的竞赛红旗。
    中共郫县县委为保证社干部参加生产领导生产，保证他们的收益不比一般社员低，决定从精简会议、不使干部兼职过多等方面着手，使每个社干部今年至少有二百天的时间参加生产。
