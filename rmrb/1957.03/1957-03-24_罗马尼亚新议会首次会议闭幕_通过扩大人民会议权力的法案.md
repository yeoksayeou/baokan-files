Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, March 23rd. The Romanian National Assembly session closed on the 22nd.

At the closing session, those present listened to and discussed the report on the draft law on the organization and work of the People's Councils and adopted the law proposed in the report, which aims to expand the powers of the People's Councils and improve the level and responsibility of the People's Councils in leading local economic, cultural, and social life. According to the provisions of the law, the People's Councils at all levels should be the state power organs of the states, cities, counties, and townships. Their powers have been expanded compared to the past, and their tasks are to protect the rights of citizens, approve and implement the local economic plans and budget, develop local industry and commerce, lead the socialist transformation of handicrafts and agriculture, improve the people's livelihood, etc. The executive and administrative organs of the People's Councils are the executive committees. Their leadership relations have also changed. For example, the executive committee of the state People's Council used to work under the leadership of the relevant ministries of the central Council of Ministers. It is now stipulated that the executive committees of the People's Councils at all levels work under the direct leadership of the People's Council at the same level.

This session, which began on the 16th, is a new development in the democratic life of the Romanian people. At the meeting, reports on the government's work, the annual state budget, and the draft law on the organization and work of the People's Councils were approved only after thorough discussion, voting on each item by show of hands, and secret ballots. During the discussions, the deputies frankly expressed their opinions and raised questions. It can be expected that the measures approved at this meeting to expand the powers of the National Assembly and the People's Councils will further enhance the political enthusiasm of the deputies.

    罗马尼亚新议会首次会议闭幕
    通过扩大人民会议权力的法案
　  新华社布加勒斯特23日电罗马尼亚国民议会会在22日闭幕。
  在闭幕会议上，到会的人听取和讨论了关于人民会议组织和工作法草案的报告，并且通过了报告提出的这个目的在于扩大人民会议的权限，提高人民会议在领导地方的经济生活和文化和社会生活方面的水平和责任的法案。根据法案的规定，各级人民会议应当是州、市、县和乡的国家政权机关。它们的权力比以前扩大了，它们的任务是保护公民权利，批准和执行地方经济计划和预算，发展地方工业和商业，领导手工业和农业的社会主义改造，改善人民的生活等。人民会议的执行和管理机关是执行委员会。它们的领导关系也有改变，比如州人民会议的执行委员会，从前是在中央部长会议的有关各部领导下进行工作的。现在规定各级人民会议的执行委员会都在同一级人民会议的直接领导下进行工作。
    这次从16日开始的会议是罗马尼亚人民民主生活中的一个新的发展。会上，关于政府工作、年度国家预算、人民会议组织和工作法草案等报告都是在经过充分讨论后进行了逐条举手表决并且进行了秘密投票以后才批准的。而在讨论中，议员们率直地发表了意见，提出了质询。可以期望这次会议上批准的有关扩大国民议会和人民会议职权的措施，将使议员们的政治积极性将会进一步提高。
