Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, March 3rd (By our reporter Liu Guiliang) The Leipzig International Spring Fair, with its long history, opened on the evening of March 2nd at the Leipzig Playhouse.

    Heinrich Rau, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and Domestic Trade of the German Democratic Republic, pointed out in his opening speech that about 10,000 exhibiting units from forty countries participated in this fair, including Japan, Pakistan, Syria, Iceland, and Bolivia participating for the first time. The total area of the fair is 275,000 square meters, which is larger than before. Visitors from more than fifty countries came to visit the fair.

    Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the Democratic German Government, ministers of various departments, government delegations from the Soviet Union, China and more than ten other countries, diplomatic envoys from various countries to the Democratic Germany, and about one thousand other guests attended the opening ceremony.

    Heinrich Rau said in his opening speech that despite the imperialists stepping up the creation of international tensions in 1956, the trade volume between East and West still had a significant increase during the year. He said that the Government of the German Democratic Republic fully agrees with the Soviet Government's proposal to convene a world economic conference in order to ease international tensions and improve relations between Eastern and Western countries.

    Heinrich Rau pointed out that the grand scale of this fair reflects the desire of economic and trade circles in various countries to expand international trade. He accused the "European Common Market" plan of being aimed at East-West trade and meaning a new obstacle to the peaceful reunification of Germany. He emphasized that expanding trade between the two Germanys and eliminating artificial obstacles to trade between East and West Germany would help the peaceful resolution of the German reunification issue. In this regard, he especially mentioned that among the approximately ten thousand exhibiting units participating in this exhibition, about one thousand exhibiting units are from West Germany.

    The unusually sunny weather in Leipzig this spring made the fair particularly colorful and lively. Buildings in the city are hung with the national flags of countries all over the world, and the streets are crowded with traffic and people everywhere. All hotels have announced that they are fully booked, and the hospitable citizens of Leipzig have vacated their most beautiful rooms to receive guests from afar.

    来比锡春季博览会开幕
    有四十个国家一万个单位参加
    新华社来比锡3日电  本社记者刘桂梁报道：有着悠久历史的来比锡春季国际博览会2日晚上在来比锡话剧院举行了开幕典礼。
    德意志民主共和国副总理兼对外与国内贸易部部长海因里希·劳在开幕词里指出，参加这次博览会的有四十个国家的约一万个展出单位，其中日本、巴基斯坦、叙利亚、冰岛和玻利维亚等国家是第一次参加。博览会的总面积为二十七万五千平方公尺，比以前又有扩大。前来参观博览会的有来自五十多个国家的参观者。
    民主德国政府总理格罗提渥及各部部长，苏联、中国等十多个国家的政府代表团及各国驻民主德国的外交使节和其他约一千名来宾参加了开幕典礼。
    海因里希·劳在开幕词中说，尽管帝国主义者在1956年加紧制造国际紧张局势，东西方之间的贸易额在这一年中还是有很大的增长。他说，德意志民主共和国政府完全赞同苏联政府关于召开世界经济会议的主张，以便缓和国际紧张局势和改善东西方国家之间的关系。
    海因里希·劳指出，这次博览会的盛大规模反映了各国经济贸易界人士要求扩大国际贸易往来的愿望。他指责“欧洲共同市场”计划的矛头是针对着东西方贸易的，并且意味着在和平统一德国的道路上设置一个新的障碍。他强调指出，扩大两个德国之间的贸易，消除东西德贸易的人为障碍会有助于德国重新统一问题的和平解决。在这方面，他特别提到，在参加这次展出的一万个左右的展出单位中，约一千个展出单位是来自西德的。
    今年入春以来来比锡所罕见的晴朗天气使博览会显得分外多采和活跃。市内建筑物上挂满了世界各国国旗，街道上车水马龙，到处拥挤着人流。所有旅馆都宣告客满，有着好客传统的来比锡市民腾出自己最漂亮的房间来接待来自远方的客人。
