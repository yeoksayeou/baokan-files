Xinhua News Agency, March 12th: The capitals of the United States, Britain, and France each released on the 11th the notes that their respective governments sent to the Soviet government on the same day. In these notes, they rejected the Soviet government's proposal on the Middle East issue, as outlined in the note sent to the three governments on February 11th. In that note, the Soviet government proposed that the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France formulate and declare basic principles regarding peace and security in the Near and Middle East, as well as non-interference in the internal affairs of countries in the region, to promote peace in the region and the independence and economic development of Middle Eastern countries.

In its reply, the U.S. government specifically stated that it could not accept the Soviet proposals to refrain from dragging Middle Eastern countries into military blocs, to eliminate foreign military bases in the Middle East, to withdraw foreign troops from the Middle East, and to prohibit the shipment of arms to the Middle East. The note argued that it could not obstruct Middle Eastern countries from uniting with other countries in "collective security treaties." The note emphasized that the U.S. policy program for the Middle East is the Eisenhower Plan.

The British reply repeated some of the points in the U.S. reply and stated that the Soviet Union had exacerbated the tension in the Middle East.

The French government's note argued that the permanent members of the Security Council bear a special responsibility for easing tensions in the Middle East, but it similarly rejected the Soviet proposal.

    美英法蛮横拒绝苏联中东建议
    彻底暴露西方国家侵略中东的阴谋
    据新华社12日讯　美、英、法三国首都在11日分别公布了本国政府在当天向苏联政府发出的照会，它们在照会里拒绝了苏联政府在2月11日致三国政府照会中提出的关于中东问题的建议，苏联政府在这个照会中建议由苏、美、英、法四国政府制定和宣布关于中近东和平和安全以及不干涉这一地区各国内政的基本原则，以促进这一地区的和平和中东国家的独立和经济发展。
    美国政府在它的复照里特别表示不能接受苏联提出的不把中东国家拖入军事集团、取消外国在中东的军事基地、从中东撤退外国军队和禁止向中东运送军火的建议。照会里认为，不能阻挠中东国家在“集体安全条约”中同其他国家联合。照会强调，美国对中东的政策纲领是艾森豪威尔计划。
    英国的复照重复了美国复照的一些论点，并且说苏联加剧了中东的紧张局势。
    法国政府的照会里认为安全理事会常任理事国对缓和中东紧张局势负有特殊责任，但是它同样拒绝了苏联的建议。
