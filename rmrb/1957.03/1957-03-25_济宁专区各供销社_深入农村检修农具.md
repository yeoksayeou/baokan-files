Jining Prefecture Supply and Marketing Cooperatives
　　Deeply Go into Rural Areas to Repair Farm Tools
　　(Our dispatch) The supply and marketing cooperatives in Jining Prefecture, Shandong Province, are going deep into the rural areas to help agricultural cooperatives repair new-style farm tools.
　　According to statistics from seven counties including Wenshang and Ziyang, local supply and marketing cooperatives have inspected and repaired various large-scale farm tools currently owned by 3,457 agricultural cooperatives, and have helped agricultural cooperatives allocate 4,531 spare parts. For example, thirty-seven cadres from the Tengxian County supply and marketing cooperative who went to the countryside helped more than 2,500 agricultural cooperatives repair waterwheels, accounting for 17% of all waterwheels, and repaired seventy-three double (single) furrow plows in thirty-five days.
　　When helping agricultural cooperatives repair farm tools, local supply and marketing cooperatives adopted the method of "repairing while teaching." For example, cadres from the Ziyang and other county supply and marketing cooperatives helped agricultural cooperatives train technicians while repairing farm tools. Now, 278 people have learned repair work. This approach of the supply and marketing cooperatives has been well received by the masses.

　　济宁专区各供销社
　　深入农村检修农具
    本报讯　山东济宁专区各地供销合作社，深入农村帮助各农业社检修新式农具。
    据汶上、滋阳等七个县的统计，各地供销社已对三千四百五十七个农业社现有的各种大型农具进行了检修，并帮助农业社配零件四千五百三十一件。如滕县各区供销社下乡的三十七个干部，在三十五天内，帮助二千五百多个农业社检修的水车占全部水车数的17％，修好了双（单）铧犁七十三部。
    各地供销社在帮助农业社检修农具的时候，采用了“边修边教”的方法。如滋阳等县供销社干部，在检修农具的时候，帮助农业社训练技术员，现在已有二百七十八人学会了检修工作。供销社的这种做法，得到了广大群众的好评。
