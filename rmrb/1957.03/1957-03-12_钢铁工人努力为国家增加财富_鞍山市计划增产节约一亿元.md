Steelworkers Strive to Increase National Wealth
Anshan Plans to Increase Production and Save 100 Million Yuan

Steel capital Anshan plans to increase production and save 100 million yuan in wealth for the country this year. This was decided after extensive discussions at an enlarged meeting convened by the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the 6th.

After heatedly discussing the national plan and the plan for increasing production and practicing economy, the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company proposed a plan to increase production by 140,000 tons of steel materials, 100,000 tons of steel, 80,000 tons of pig iron, and 70,000 tons of coke this year.

In the movement to increase production and practice economy, the broad masses of workers in Anshan have tapped potential in all aspects with very high production enthusiasm. Anshan Iron and Steel Company alone will increase production and save more than 83 million yuan in wealth for the country this year. The profits directly turned over to the state can reach more than 46 million yuan. The production plan for this year for the large rolling mill under this company has already increased by nearly 150,000 tons compared with the actual production last year. After mass discussion, it was proposed that the state can be supplied with an additional 50,000 tons of heavy rails and large-sized high-quality steel products. This year, the production plan of the seamless steel tube plant has already exceeded the original production capacity of the plant, but in the movement to increase production and practice economy, their production increase plan has been changed three times, from the initial increase of 6,600 tons of seamless steel tubes to 8,600 tons. In terms of savings, the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel have also found ways to reduce costs by improving product quality. If the first-grade product rate of each rolling mill is increased by 1%, it can save 390,000 yuan. The first-grade product rate of the large rolling mill in February increased by 4.82% compared with the plan. The ironmaking workers proposed a plan to reduce the coke consumption per ton of iron by another 10 kilograms, which alone can save 1.29 million yuan. The workers of the two steelmaking plants are also determined to save more than 2,000 tons of pig iron and scrap steel for the country.

The builders of Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation will save more than 15 million yuan in construction funds this year. The workers of Anshan's local industry and the geological prospecting team members in the Anshan area also plan to increase production and save 2.5 million yuan in wealth.

Shanghai's Steel Industry Exceeds February Plan

Shanghai's steel industry produced more than 700 tons of steel and more than 3,400 tons of steel materials more than planned in February. All steel plants completed the output plans for steel and steel materials in February. Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant, which had not completed the output plan for nine months last year, has also undergone a change, and has completed the plan for January and February continuously.

Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Achieves Results in Reducing Material Consumption

In February, the consumption of metal materials in the steelmaking, electric furnace steelmaking, rolling, sheet and forging workshops of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant generally decreased. According to the statistics of thirteen main products, 418 tons of metal materials were used less than planned.

The workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant learned about the current shortage of metal materials and came up with many ways to save raw materials. The steelmaking workers of the steelmaking department tried to increase the proportion of pig iron in the steelmaking raw materials, and the metal material used for producing each ton of steel was significantly reduced, saving more than 110 tons in February alone. The workers of the electric furnace steelmaking department conscientiously implemented oxygen blowing steelmaking, and also tested the method of adding pig iron to refine alloy steel, and the consumption of metal materials for carbon steel and alloy steel was reduced.

The workers in the steel rolling workshop—rolling, sheet and forging workshops—have promoted many advanced experiences in saving steel ingots and steel billets in the first two months of this year. The workers of the rolling department changed the past method of using large materials into a new rolling method, and also promoted negative tolerances, which not only reduced the cutting head, but also increased the output. In February, more than 90 tons of steel ingots were saved in rolling small steel and medium-sized boiling steel.

Chongqing Iron and Steel Company Focuses on Promoting Twenty Advanced Experiences

Chongqing Iron and Steel Company strengthens the promotion of twenty major advanced experiences, focusing on the key issues of increasing production and practicing economy. In formulating this year's plan for increasing production and practicing economy, the company carefully studied the difficulties in production and regarded the promotion of advanced experience as one of the important measures to solve the difficulties.

The shortage of pig iron supply, which cannot meet the needs of steelmaking, is one of the biggest difficulties in increasing production this year. The company studies that a central link and main method for increasing production this year is to promote five advanced experiences such as self-fluxing sintered ore and ore grading into the furnace to improve the output and quality of pig iron.

Due to further measures to promote advanced experience and strengthen the equipment maintenance of blast furnaces, the ironmaking workshop can increase the production of 7,000 tons of pig iron to supply steelmaking.

The company also focuses on promoting nine advanced experiences in reducing material consumption and improving quality. In order to better promote the advanced experience of rolling negative tolerances, the workers of the two rolling workshops are improving the relevant rolling technical measures and the management of materials and products. The two workshops are expected to save more than 3,000 tons of metal materials this year. The two steelmaking workshops of the company are also strengthening the organizational promotion of advanced experiences such as thick-layer sintering furnace bottom, thermal control, and pouring and raw material management. Only further improving the promotion of the thick-layer sintering furnace bottom can increase the production of 1,500 tons of steel this year.

Xinjiang Bayi Steel Plant Completes Five-Year Plan Steel Ingot Production

The local state-owned Xinjiang Bayi Steel Plant completed the cumulative output of steel ingots in the first five-year plan on the 5th, nine months and twenty-six days ahead of schedule. The steel ingots produced in January, February, and the first five days of March this year alone are equivalent to the total steel ingot output in 1953.

All the workers of the plant have continuously improved steelmaking equipment and technical operations, significantly increasing steel production. Due to the improvement of the internal shape and blowing method of the steelmaking converter, the average daily steel production in 1956 increased by 50% compared with the daily production in 1955.

Due to the importance attached to and promotion of advanced experiences at home and abroad, the plant has made many achievements in blowing high-phosphorus pig iron with alkaline converters and improving the quality of converter steel. It can use pig iron with a phosphorus content of up to about 1.2% to produce various qualified steels. In October last year, the qualification rate of steel ingots reached 99.71%, and some properties of steel also exceeded the national standard for alkaline converter steel, approaching or reaching the level of open-hearth steel.

    钢铁工人努力为国家增加财富
    鞍山市计划增产节约一亿元
    钢都鞍山将在今年内为国家增产节约一亿元财富。这是在中共鞍山市委6日召开的一个扩大会议上经过广泛讨论以后决定的。
    鞍山钢铁公司职工在热烈讨论国家计划和增产节约计划以后，提出了在今年内增产十四万吨钢材、十万吨钢、八万吨生铁、七万吨焦炭的计划。
    在增产节约运动中，鞍山市的广大职工以非常高涨的生产热情，挖掘出各方面的潜力。仅鞍山钢铁公司一个单位，今年就将为国家增产节约八千三百多万元的财富。直接上缴给国家的利润可达四千六百多万元。这个公司所属的大型轧钢厂今年的生产计划已经比去年实际增加了将近十五万吨，经过群众讨论，又提出可以给国家增产五万吨重轨和大型优质钢材的计划。今年无缝钢管厂的生产计划早已经超过了这个厂原订的生产能力，可是在增产节约运动中，他们的增产计划已经变更过三次，从最初增产六千六百吨无缝钢管提高到八千六百吨。在节约方面，鞍钢的职工们也找到了提高产品质量来降低成本的途径。各个轧钢厂只要把一级品率提高1％就能够节约三十九万元。大型轧钢厂在2月份的一级品率就比计划提高了4.82％。炼铁工人提出了每炼一吨铁所消耗的焦炭再降低十公斤的计划，仅这一项就可以节约一百二十九万元。两个炼钢厂的职工也决心给国家节约二千多吨生铁和废钢。
    鞍山冶金建筑总公司的建设者们，要在今年节约一千五百万元以上的建设资金。鞍山市地方工业的职工和在鞍山地区的地质勘探队员们，也计划增产节约二百五十万元的财富。
    上海钢铁工业超额完成二月份计划
    上海钢铁工业2月份比计划多生产了七百多吨钢和三千四百多吨钢材。各钢厂2月份都完成了钢和钢材的产量计划。去年有九个月没有完成过产量计划的上海第六钢厂，也有了转变，1、2月份连续完成了计划。
    太原钢铁厂降低材料消耗有成绩
    2月份太原钢铁厂炼钢、电炉炼钢、轧钢、薄板和锻钢五个车间的金属材料消耗普遍降低。据十三种主要产品统计，比计划少用了四百一十八吨金属材料。
    太原钢铁厂工人了解到当前金属材料缺乏的情况，想出许多办法节约原料。炼钢部炼钢工人们设法提高了炼钢原料中生铁所占的比重，生产每吨钢用的金属材料就有了显著降低，仅2月份就节约了一百一十多吨。电炉炼钢部职工认真实行吹氧炼钢，并且试验了炼合金钢加生铁的方法，炭素钢和合金钢的金属材料消耗都减少了。
    钢材轧制车间——轧钢、薄板和锻钢车间的职工们，在今年头两个月中推广了许多节约钢锭、钢胚的先进经验。轧钢部的职工把过去下大料的方法改成一种新的轧制方法，并且推行了负公差，不仅减少了切头，还提高了产量，2月份在轧制小型钢材和中型沸腾钢材中就节约了九十多吨钢锭。
    重庆钢铁公司着重推广二十项先进经验
    重庆钢铁公司针对增产节约的关键问题，加强二十项重大先进经验的推广工作。这个公司在制定今年的增产节约计划中，认真研究了生产中的困难，把推广先进经验作为解决困难的重要措施之一。
    生铁供应不足，不能满足炼钢的需要，这是今年增产中一个最大的困难。这个公司研究今年增产的一个中心环节和主要办法，是推广自熔性烧结矿、矿石分级入炉等五项先进经验，来提高生铁产量和质量。
    由于进一步采取推广先进经验的措施，和加强高炉的设备维护工作，炼铁车间就可以增产七千吨生铁来供应炼钢。
    这个公司还着重推广了九项降低材料消耗、提高质量的先进经验。两个轧钢车间职工为了很好推广轧制负公差先进经验，正在改进有关轧制的技术措施和材料、产品的管理工作。两个车间预计今年可以节约三千多吨金属材料。这个公司的两个炼钢车间，也正在加强厚层烧结炉底、热工控制以及浇注、原料管理等先进经验的组织推广工作。仅进一步改进厚层烧结炉底的推广工作，今年就可以增产一千五百吨钢。
    新疆八一钢铁厂完成五年计划钢锭产量
    地方国营新疆八一钢铁厂在5日提前九个月零二十六天完成了第一个五年计划的钢锭累计产量。仅今年1月、2月和3月的头五天生产的钢锭，就相当于1953年全年钢锭产量。
    这个厂的全体职工不断改进炼钢设备和技术操作，显著地提高了钢的产量。由于改进了炼钢转炉的内型和吹炼方法，1956年平均每日钢产量就比1955年每日产量增加了50％。
    这个厂由于重视和推广本厂和外地先进经验，在用硷性转炉吹炼高磷生铁和提高转炉钢质量方面获得不少成就，可以用含磷高达1.2％左右的生铁，炼成各种合格钢。去年10月钢锭合格率曾达99.71％，钢的某些性能也超过国家规定硷性转炉钢的标准，而接近或达到了平炉钢的水平。
