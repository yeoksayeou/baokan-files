Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 27th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union issued a letter to the workers of state farms, calling on them to fully utilize existing conditions for increasing production, making 1957 a year of further development in all sectors of Soviet agriculture, primarily a year of great transformation in the development of meat and milk production based on a substantial increase in grain production.

The letter to state farm workers discussed the great achievements made in Soviet agricultural production in recent years. However, it went on to emphasize that by no means have all agricultural sectors achieved the necessary results, and shortcomings still exist, especially in the production of meat, potatoes, vegetables, sugar beets, and other industrial crops, as well as milk, wool, and eggs.

Currently, in agriculture, especially in state farms, it is necessary to improve the organization of production, correctly utilize the inexhaustible potential of state farms.

The CPC Central Committee and the Council of Ministers demanded that state farm workers make fuller use of all land in state farms, improve the level of cultivation, and on this basis increase the per unit area yield of crops, maximize the reclamation of remaining wasteland, reconsider the structure of cultivated land area, and greatly increase the total grain output.

State farms, especially those near cities and large industrial centers, should play a major role in supplying potatoes and vegetables to urban residents. State farms should take resolute measures to drastically increase meat production and lower the production prices of milk and meat.

The CPC Central Committee and the Council of Ministers finally expressed their deep conviction that Soviet state farm workers will work even harder this year to make every state farm a model, highly profitable agricultural enterprise, a farm that is truly advanced, truly exemplary, and of demonstration significance to the surrounding collective farms.

　　苏共中央和部长会议号召国营农场
　　大大增产粮食肉类和奶类
    新华社28日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科27日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议发表了告国营农场工作人员书，号召他们充分利用现有的增产条件，使1957年成为进一步发展苏联农业各部门、首先是成为在大大增加谷物生产的基础上发展肉类和奶类生产的大转变的一年。
    告国营农场工作人员书谈到了近几年苏联农业生产所取得的巨大成就。但是，它接着强调指出，远不是所有农业部门都取得了必要的成绩，尤其是在肉类、马铃薯、蔬菜、甜菜和其他技术作物以及牛奶、羊毛和蛋类的生产方面还存在着缺点。
    目前在农业中，首先是在国营农场中必须改进生产的组织，正确地发挥国营农场的取之不尽的潜力。
    苏共中央和部长会议要求国营农场工作人员更充分地利用国营农场的一切土地、提高耕作水平，并且在这个基础上提高作物的单位面积产量，最大限度地开垦剩下的荒地，重新考虑耕地面积的结构和大大地提高谷物的总产量。
    国营农场特别是城市和大工业中心附近的国营农场应当在为城市居民供应马铃薯和蔬菜方面占主要地位。国营农场应当采取坚决措施急剧增加肉类生产，降低牛奶和肉类的生产价格。
    苏共中央和部长会议最后表示深信，苏联国营农场工作人员今年一定会更加努力，使每一个国营农场成为模范的、收入很多的农业企业，成为对周围集体农庄具有真正先进的、真正的模范和示范意义的农场。
