Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 28th: A grand gathering of working people from all walks of life in Moscow was held in the Grand Kremlin Palace on the afternoon of March 27th to celebrate the friendship between the Soviet and Hungarian peoples.

The delegation of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government and the Socialist Workers' Party, headed by Kádár, attended the meeting. The Hungarian guests were warmly welcomed by the three thousand representatives from all walks of life in the capital who attended the meeting. Accompanying the guests of honor on the presidium were Soviet leaders Bulganin, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Malenkov, Mikoyan, Molotov, Pervukhin, Suslov, Khrushchev, Zhukov, Shepilov, and Shvernik.

Comrade Kádár and Comrade Bulganin spoke at the meeting successively. Their speeches continuously won warm applause from the audience.

Prior to this, the chairman of the Moscow City Soviet, Bobrovnikov, and representatives of workers and intellectuals delivered welcoming speeches.

　　Kádár said: Soviet-Hungarian friendship is extremely important to the Hungarian people

In his speech, Kádár talked about the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary last October, the lessons learned from this event, and the unity of countries in the socialist camp.

Kádár said that the counter-revolutionary rebellion in October 1956 interrupted Hungary's socialist construction work of the past twelve years. In the past twelve years, Hungary has achieved historically significant victories in all aspects. However, in the process of this huge and encouraging construction work by the Hungarian people, the former national and party leaders made many mistakes in recent years. The consequences of these mistakes affected all aspects of national work and social life. But it should be said that they are still secondary compared to the achievements of socialist construction. The past twelve years have been the first great and victorious stage of socialist construction.

Kádár said that due to the weakening of some of the machinery of the entire proletarian dictatorship caused by past mistakes, and the mistakes themselves, Hungary's deadly enemies were able to use this as an excuse to attack the party's prestige, undermine the strength of the proletarian dictatorship, and organize a counter-revolutionary rebellion to subvert the Hungarian People's Republic.

The key to the fact that the counter-revolutionary rebellion made some progress lies in the internal betrayal policy of the Nagy and Losonczy traitor groups. This group, under the pretext of fighting against mistakes, not only began to destroy the party from within, but also formed an alliance with reactionary dark forces, trying to eliminate the party from the outside. They carried out nationalist agitation, used a revisionist attitude to negate the party's leading role, and reactively distorted the concept of liberal democracy to oppose socialist democracy, thus giving the counter-revolution ideological weapons. Moreover, due to their betrayal, at the decisive moment, they paralyzed the strength of the party and the state, as well as the ability of the masses loyal to socialism to act.

The main plotters, leaders, and instigators of the counter-revolutionary attack on the Hungarian People's Republic, as well as the financiers of the rebellion and the backbone of all counter-revolutionary forces, are the imperialist groups headed by the United States.

Kádár said that relying on the friendly support of the Soviet Union, the Hungarian People's Republic eliminated the counter-revolutionary rebellion. Relying on the assistance of the Soviet Union, China, and all countries in the socialist camp, the Hungarian people are successfully clearing away the serious losses caused by the counter-revolutionary attack. In terms of economic activities and all aspects of life, the Hungarian working people are gradually restarting the great work of building socialism. The worker-peasant state that fulfills the functions of the proletarian dictatorship—the Hungarian People's Republic—exists and is being consolidated day by day.

Kádár said that our party and government have deeply analyzed the events that have occurred and have learned important lessons from the counter-revolutionary attack. We believe that it is first necessary to resolutely repel all kinds of attempts to revise Lenin's theory of the party. We believe that it is necessary to establish and strengthen the leading and basic force of the proletarian dictatorship—the revolutionary Marxist-Leninist party—and at the same time, it is necessary to constantly ensure the party's ideological, political, and organizational unity.

The leading organs of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party are vigilant against the narrow sectarian errors of the past and are now working to maintain and develop the healthy characteristics of party building. The most important task of party building is to ensure that only true communists are allowed into the ranks of party members, to prohibit the establishment of various factional organizations within the party, to eradicate influences that are detrimental to the party, and to strengthen the party's unity.

Having learned from the experience, we are consolidating the proletarian dictatorship and our People's Republic by strengthening socialist democracy in accordance with the line of linking with the masses of the people. Today, we must strengthen the side of proletarian discipline, and we must not yield in the slightest on the issue of demands for freedom and democracy for the vicious class enemies and their accomplices.

Kádár then said that one of the central issues in our struggle against the counter-revolutionary forces of bourgeois nationalism and the revisionism that paves the way for these counter-revolutionary forces is the issue of proletarian internationalism, especially our relations with the Soviet Union. Class enemies attack us, slander our relations with the Soviet Union, especially in terms of national independence and our trade treaties. Although there have been some formal errors in Hungarian-Soviet relations that hindered the relationship between the two countries in the past, the Soviet Union and the Soviet troops stationed in Hungary have never undermined Hungary's national independence and our sovereignty. On the contrary, they have supported and defended our national independence with all their strength. In terms of Soviet-Hungarian economic relations, the Soviet Union has often provided Hungary with a great deal of selfless and important assistance. All of this proves that Soviet-Hungarian relations are extremely important to the Hungarian people, and the Hungarian People's Republic and the Hungarian working people should be primarily concerned about this friendly relationship.

Kádár said that we believe that the relations between the countries of the socialist camp, based on the principles of proletarian internationalism, are a unified whole in terms of both the national line and the party line, because socialist countries are ruled by the working class and implement the working class's foreign policy.

The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party adheres to the principles of proletarian internationalism and opposes ideological and political attempts aimed at weakening the ties between socialist countries, and opposes such attempts appearing under the guise of so-called "national communism," "de-Stalinization," or any other guise.

Following the principles of proletarian internationalism, we maintain contact with all communist and workers' parties in the world, as well as with other organizations of the working class. All communist parties that have taken a clear stance on the Hungarian events have constantly approved our struggle and supported us politically, which has given us great spiritual and political support in the struggle against counter-revolution.

Kádár said that we deeply regret that individual leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and Yugoslav newspapers have adopted positions on the most important issues of our party and our country that are fundamentally different from ours and that we cannot agree with. For example, we cannot agree with the views of Comrades Kardelj and Popović, who believe that a revolution took place in Hungary last year.

We also cannot accept the view that the efforts of Hungarian communists to restore the party in its previous form are futile. According to our Marxist-Leninist beliefs, without the leadership of a Marxist-Leninist party, it is impossible for the working class to wage a struggle for liberation, and it will be even less possible for the working class to realize the class dictatorship and defend the power it has won. We must reject the suggestion that Comrade Kardelj once made to us: to build our state power on the basis of the so-called Central Workers' Committee and regional workers' committees that have taken armed provocations against our people's power.

Kádár said that we believe that proletarian internationalism is the great force of the international working class and human progress, and that this force will be able to overcome all erroneous views that have gone astray and move forward along its own path of healthy development.

　　Bulganin said: The unity of the socialist camp is a pillar of peace

In his speech, Bulganin said that our party and the Soviet people have always had deep sympathy for the Hungarian people and supported their struggle for national independence and for liberation from the oppression of capitalists, landlords, and interventionists. The Soviet people are very pleased with every new victory of the Hungarian working people in socialist construction.

Bulganin said that the transformation of the entire life of Hungary was carried out under the condition of war-torn wounds. Therefore, many difficulties arose, and these difficulties were deepened by the great mistakes made by the former national leaders. The disguised fascists and all kinds of counter-revolutionaries tried every means to exaggerate the mistakes of the leaders, incite nationalist fanaticism, and provoke anti-Soviet slander, and their main force was aimed at the dictatorship of the working class and the people's power.

Speaking of the disgraceful role played by the Nagy-Losonczy traitor group in indulging counter-revolutionary activities in Hungary, Bulganin said that the irrefutable facts convincingly show that Nagy, who was cloaked in the cloak of a Communist, had in fact been serving the enemies of the Hungarian people long before the events of October 1956. He and his group, under the false banner of "new policies in socialist construction," attempted to weaken the young people's democratic state and lead it away from the path of socialism. When Nagy seized power, the true face of this group was fully exposed.

Bulganin said that it is not surprising that the imperialists called the counter-revolutionary riots a "revolution" and praised the Nagy group. But what should we say about the fact that some communists' assessment of the Hungarian events is essentially no different from that of the imperialists?

Communists cannot interpret events in this way. But after all, there are such facts. Some Yugoslavs think that they can turn a blind eye to the rampant fascist terror that was raging in Hungary last October and only judge the "revolutionary nature" of this event and support Nagy. In the difficult days of Hungary, the Yugoslav side not only made laudatory remarks about the "nature of the October events," but also, as everyone knows, Nagy and his group received practical support from the Yugoslavs. This support fueled and encouraged Nagy. It was no accident that when the counter-revolution in Budapest was defeated, Nagy and his group went to the Yugoslav Embassy for refuge.

It should be said that all these facts cannot but deepen the ideological differences between Yugoslavia and the countries of the socialist camp. We deeply regret these differences. We have made every effort in the past and will continue to make every effort in the future to narrow and completely eliminate these differences. We hope that the Yugoslav side can also show such determination.

Bulganin said that the collapse of the counter-revolutionary forces and the rapid normalization of domestic life in Hungary vividly illustrate an indisputable fact, namely, that the unity, solidarity, and fraternal mutual assistance of the countries of the socialist camp is the greatest force, which can smash all the conspiracies of the aggressors and is a reliable pillar of world peace. The Hungarian events once again remind us that the working class and all working people should always maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and pay close attention to the conspiracies of the enemies of socialism.

Bulganin said that the most difficult period in Hungary is over. The Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government has proven in fact that only it can express the wishes of the Hungarian people and resolutely defend the interests of the people's Hungary. The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party has difficulties in its work. However, we believe that it will definitely be able to overcome these difficulties and further enhance its leading role in the country's national and social life.

Bulganin said that the entire experience of the communist movement, especially recent events, confirms Lenin's instructions on the decisive role of the Marxist party of the working class as the organizational and leading force of the people, and on its role in socialist construction based on unwavering Leninist principles. These great principles tell us that when building socialism, in addition to accurately considering the national characteristics of each country in the path of socialist development, we should also observe the universal characteristics and laws inherent in the transition period from capitalism to communism.

Bulganin said that recently, the international situation has become somewhat acute. The reactionary imperialist groups in the West are intensifying the "Cold War" and continuing to pursue the notorious policy of "position of strength." The recent Bermuda meeting of the heads of government of the United Kingdom and the United States is another proof of this. The reason why the international situation has become tense recently is mainly due to the active sabotage activities of the Western imperialist groups against the countries of the socialist camp, and because of their flagrant interference in the internal affairs of the countries of the Middle East and the Near East, even at the expense of using troops. The countries of the socialist camp cannot but consider these activities of the imperialists. We should always be vigilant and constantly care about strengthening the national defense of the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist camp. At the same time, the Soviet Union will resolutely continue the struggle to ease international tensions, to resolve outstanding issues, and to establish lasting and solid peace between countries.

Bulganin said that the Soviet Union has advocated more than once in the past, and is still advocating now, the establishment of a collective security system in Europe. However, the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, led by the United States, do not want to do so.

Under such circumstances, the Soviet government and the Hungarian government unanimously believe that it is necessary to very firmly support and consolidate the Warsaw Pact, which is responsible for defending socialist countries against the imperialist conspiracies of Europe.

Finally, Bulganin talked about Soviet-Hungarian relations, saying that the relations between our two countries are socialist relations. The basis of the Soviet Union's relations with socialist countries has always been: to assist its friends in developing their economies, raising the living standards of working people, and strengthening the independence and sovereignty of countries. The talks between the Soviet and Hungarian delegations will help further develop and strengthen the comprehensive ties between the two countries. (Attached picture)

    庆祝苏匈两国人民的友谊
    莫斯科劳动人民盛大集会
    新华社莫斯科28日电  3月27日下午，莫斯科各界劳动人民在大克里姆林宫举行了盛大的集会，庆祝苏联和匈牙利两国人民的友谊。
    以卡达尔为首的匈牙利工农革命政府和社会主义工人党代表团参加了这次大会。匈牙利贵宾们受到了与会的三千名首都各界代表的热烈欢迎。陪同贵宾在主席台上就座有苏联的领导人布尔加宁、伏罗希洛夫、卡冈诺维奇、马林科夫、米高扬、莫洛托夫、别尔乌辛、苏斯洛夫、赫鲁晓夫、朱可夫、谢皮洛夫、什维尔尼克。
    卡达尔同志和布尔加宁同志先后在大会上讲了话。他们的讲话不断博得了全场的热烈鼓掌。
    在这之前，莫斯科市苏维埃主席波布罗夫尼科夫以及工人、知识分子的代表们相继致欢迎词。
　　卡达尔说：苏匈友好对匈牙利人民极其重要
    卡达尔在讲话中谈到了匈牙利去年十月反革命叛乱和这次事件的经验教训以及关于社会主义阵营国家的团结等问题。
    卡达尔说，1956年十月反革命叛乱使匈牙利十二年来的社会主义建设工作中断。在过去十二年中，匈牙利在各方面取得了具有历史意义的胜利。但是，在匈牙利人民进行这种巨大的、令人鼓舞的建设工作过程中，前国家和党的领导在最近几年中犯了许多错误。这些错误的后果影响到国家工作和社会生活的各个方面。但是应当说，比起社会主义建设的成就它们仍旧是次要的。过去的十二年是社会主义建设的第一个巨大的胜利阶段。
    卡达尔说，由于过去的错误所造成的整个无产阶级专政的机器的某些削弱和所犯的这些错误本身，使匈牙利人民的死敌得以利用作为借口来打击党的威信，破坏无产阶级专政的力量，组织反革命叛乱来颠复匈牙利人民共和国。
    反革命叛乱之所以取得一点进展，关键在于纳吉和洛松齐叛逆集团的内部出卖政策。这个集团借口向错误作斗争，不仅开始从内部破坏党，而且同反动的黑暗势力结成同盟，极力从外部来消灭党。他们进行民族主义的煽动，用修正主义者的态度来否定党的领导作用，反动地歪曲自由民主的概念以反对社会主义民主，这样来给反革命以思想武器。而且，由于他们的背叛活动，在决定性的时刻他们麻痹了党和国家的力量以及忠于社会主义的群众的活动能力。
    对匈牙利人民共和国的反革命进攻的主要策动者、领导者和鼓动者，以及这次叛乱经费的资助者、一切反革命势力的支柱，是以美国为首的帝国主义集团。
    卡达尔说，依靠苏联的友好支援，匈牙利人民共和国消灭了反革命叛乱。匈牙利人民依靠苏联、中国和社会主义阵营一切国家的援助正在顺利地扫除反革命进攻造成的严重损失。在经济活动方面以及生活的各方面，匈牙利劳动人民逐步重新开始建设社会主义的巨大工作。实现无产阶级专政职能的工农国家——匈牙利人民共和国存在着而且正在日益巩固。
    卡达尔说，我们的党和政府深入地分析了所发生的事件，并且从反革命进攻的事件中吸取了重要的教训。我们认为首先必须以最坚决的态度击退各种各样修正列宁关于党的学说的企图。我们认为必须建立和加强无产阶级专政的领导力量和基本力量——革命的马克思列宁主义政党，同时必须经常保证党在思想上、政治上和组织上的统一。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党的领导机构警惕着过去所犯的狭隘的宗派主义的错误，现在正在努力保持和发展党内建设的健康的特点。党内建设最重要的任务就是要保证，党员的队伍中只能容纳真正的共产党员，禁止在党内成立各种各样的派别组织，根绝对党不利的影响和加强党的团结一致。
    由于吸取了经验教训，我们通过根据联系人民群众的路线来加强社会主义民主的方式，巩固无产阶级专政和我们的人民共和国。我们今天要加强无产阶级惩戒的一面，而且在对要求给凶暴的阶级敌人和他们的帮凶以自由和民主的问题上一点也不能让步。
    卡达尔接着说，我们同资产阶级民族主义的反革命势力以及为这种反革命势力开辟道路的修正主义进行斗争的中心问题之一就是无产阶级国际主义问题，特别是我们同苏联的关系问题。阶级敌人攻击我们，诽谤我们同苏联的关系，特别是在民族独立和我们的贸易条约方面。虽然过去在匈苏两国关系间曾经有过某些妨碍了两国关系的形式上的错误，但是苏联和驻在匈牙利的苏联军队却从来没有破坏过匈牙利的民族独立和我们的主权，相反，他们用全力支持和保卫了我们的民族独立。在苏匈经济关系方面，苏联经常给予匈牙利大量无私而重要的帮助。这一切证明，苏匈关系对匈牙利人民是极其重要的，而匈牙利人民共和国和匈牙利劳动人民是首先应该关切到这种友好关系的。
    卡达尔说，我们认为，以无产阶级国际主义原则为基础的社会主义阵营各国间的关系，无论在国家路线和党的路线上都是一个统一的整体，因为社会主义国家是由工人阶级执政的，实施的是工人阶级的对外政策。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党坚持无产阶级国际主义原则，反对以削弱社会主义国家之间的联系为目的的具有敌对情绪的思想上和政治上的企图，反对以所谓“民族共产主义”、“非斯大林主义”为标志以及任何其他标志出现的这种企图。
    遵循无产阶级国际主义的原则，我们同世界上所有共产党和工人党以及同工人阶级的其他组织取得联系。所有对匈牙利事件采取明确立场的共产党不断地赞同我们的斗争和在政治上支持我们，这些给我们在反对反革命的斗争中在精神上和政治上很大的支援。
    卡达尔说，我们感到非常遗憾，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的个别领导人和南斯拉夫报纸在对待我们党和我们国家最重要的问题上采取了同我们在原则上有分歧和为我们所不能同意的立场。例如，我们不能同意卡德尔和波波维奇两位同志的看法，他们认为，去年在匈牙利发生了革命。
    我们同样不能接受这样一种观点，即认为匈牙利共产党人采取的希望恢复过去形式的党的努力是徒劳无益的。根据我们马克思列宁主义的信念，如果没有马克思列宁主义的党的领导，工人阶级就不可能进行争取解放的斗争，工人阶级就会更少有可能实现阶级专政和保卫争取到的政权。我们应当拒绝卡德尔同志曾经提出过的这一建议：把我们的国家政权建筑在对我们人民政权采取武装挑衅的所谓中央工人委员会和区域性的工人委员会的基础上。
    卡达尔说，我们认为，无产阶级国际主义是国际工人阶级和人类进步的伟大力量，这种力量将能克服陷入迷途的一切错误观点，沿着自己健康发展的道路前进。
　　布尔加宁说：社会主义阵营的团结是和平支柱
    布尔加宁在讲话中说，我们党和苏联人民一向就对匈牙利人民怀着深切的同情，支持他们争取民族独立、争取摆脱资本家、地主和干涉者的压迫的斗争。苏联人民对匈牙利劳动人民在社会主义建设中的每一个新的胜利都感到十分高兴。
    布尔加宁说，匈牙利整个生活的改造是在战争创伤累累的情况下进行的。因此就产生了许多困难，这些困难又由于前国家的领导犯了很大的错误而加深了。伪装起来的法西斯分子和形形色色的反革命分子千方百计地夸大领导的错误，鼓动民族主义狂热，挑起反苏的污蔑言论，而他们主要的力量是针对着工人阶级专政和人民政权。
    在谈到纳吉—洛松齐叛逆集团在放纵匈牙利反革命活动方面所起的可耻作用时，布尔加宁说确定不移的事实令人信服地表明，披着共产党人的外衣的纳吉早在1956年十月事件之前很久，事实上就是为匈牙利人民的敌人服务的。他和他的集团在“社会主义建设中的新方针”的虚伪旗帜下进行活动，企图使年轻的人民民主国家削弱，使它脱离社会主义的道路。当纳吉掌握住政权的时候，这个集团的真面目就完全暴露了。
    布尔加宁说，帝国主义者把反革命暴乱称为“革命”，并且赞扬纳吉集团，这是不足为奇的。但是，有些共产党员对匈牙利事件的估价实质上同帝国主义者并没有区别，这应当怎么说呢？
    共产党人是不能这样来解释事件的。而毕竟有这样的事实，有些南斯拉夫人士认为可以对去年十月在匈牙利猖獗一时的法西斯恐怖活动的嚣张情况不闻不问，只是在评判这一事件的“革命性”和支持纳吉。在匈牙利艰难的日子里，南斯拉夫方面不仅对“十月事件的性质”发出赞扬的评语，而且大家知道，纳吉和他的集团得到了南斯拉夫人的实际支持。这种支持助长了和鼓励了纳吉。当布达佩斯的反革命被击溃的时候，纳吉和他的集团前往南斯拉夫大使馆避难，这也不是偶然的。
    应该说，这一切事实不能不使南斯拉夫和社会主义阵营国家的那些意识形态性质的分歧更加加深。对于有着这些分歧，我们从内心感到惋惜。我们曾尽了一切努力，将来也还要尽一切努力来缩小和完全消除这些分歧。我们希望，南斯拉夫方面也能表现这样的决心。
    布尔加宁说，反革命势力的崩溃和匈牙利国内生活的迅速正常化鲜明地表明了一个无可争辩的事实，即社会主义阵营各国的统一、团结和兄弟互助是最伟大的力量，它可以粉碎侵略者的种种阴谋，它是世界和平的可靠支柱。匈牙利事件再次提醒我们，工人阶级和全体劳动人民应当经常保持高度的革命警惕性，密切注意社会主义的敌人的阴谋。
    布尔加宁说，匈牙利的最困难的时期已经过去了。工农革命政府从事实上证明了，只有它能表达匈牙利人民的愿望和坚决地保卫人民匈牙利的利益。匈牙利社会主义工人党在工作中是有困难的。但是，我们相信，它一定能克服这些困难，和更加提高自己在国家的国政和社会生活中的领导作用。
    布尔加宁说，共产主义运动，特别是近来的事件的全部经验证实了列宁关于工人阶级的马克思主义政党作为人民的组织力量和领导力量的决定性作用，关于它在以确定不移的列宁主义原则为基础的社会主义建设中的作用的指示。这些伟大的原则告诉我们，在建设社会主义的时候，除精确地考虑每个国家在社会主义发展道路上所产生的民族特征之外，还应当遵守从资本主义到共产主义的过渡时期所固有的普遍性的特征和规律。
    布尔加宁说，近来，国际局势有些尖锐化。西方的反动帝国主义集团加紧“冷战”，并且继续执行臭名远扬的“实力地位”政策。最近英美两国政府首脑的百慕大会议就是又一个证明。最近国际局势所以紧张起来，主要是由于西方帝国主义集团对社会主义阵营国家的破坏活动活跃起来了，由于他们横加干涉中近东国家的内政，甚至不惜使用军队。社会主义阵营国家不能不考虑帝国主义者的这些活动。我们应该时常警惕着，不断关心于加强苏联和社会主义阵营各国的国防。同时，苏联将坚决继续进行争取缓和国际紧张局势、争取解决悬而未决的问题和争取各国之间建立持久和巩固的和平的斗争。
    布尔加宁说，苏联过去不止一次地主张、而且现在也在主张在欧洲建立集体安全体系。但是以美国为首的北大西洋公约组织参加国不希望这样做。
    在这种情况下，苏联政府和匈牙利政府一致认为，必须要十分坚决地支持和巩固负有保卫社会主义国家防备欧洲帝国主义阴谋的使命的华沙条约。
    最后，布尔加宁谈到了苏匈关系，他说，我们两国之间的关系是社会主义式的关系。苏联同社会主义国家的关系的依据向来是：协助自己的朋友发展经济，提高劳动人民生活水平以及加强国家的独立和主权。苏联和匈牙利两国代表团的会谈将有助于进一步发展和加强两国之间的全面联系。（附图片）
