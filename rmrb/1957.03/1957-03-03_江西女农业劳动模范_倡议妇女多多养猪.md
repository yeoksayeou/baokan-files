Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 2nd: At the Jiangxi Province 1957 Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference, which closed on February 28th, all the female representatives attending the conference put forward a proposal to rural women throughout the province to launch a pig-raising competition.

The proposed competition conditions are: 1. In 1957, ensure that each household raises at least two pigs on average, and strive to reach three; 2. It is necessary to raise enough sows to breed piglets and achieve self-breeding and self-raising; 3. Plan to appropriately reclaim wasteland or appropriately leave fertile land to grow more feed, so that each pig can have one to three fen of fixed feed base, and use open spaces to plant five pumpkin plants per person, use lakes and ponds to massively breed water hyacinth, and widely open up feed sources; 4. Ensure that the pig's hygiene and disease prevention work is done well.

The proposal states that raising more pigs can not only solve the meat problem, but also increase fertilizer. One pig is a small fertilizer factory. More pigs mean more fertilizer, and agriculture can increase production. And raising pigs is mainly the responsibility of women. We are confident that we can do the above four points, and we hope that women throughout the province can do the same to launch a pig-raising competition.

    江西女农业劳动模范
    倡议妇女多多养猪
    新华社南昌2日电  在2月28日闭幕的江西省1957年农业劳动模范代表大会上，出席大会的全体妇女代表向全省农村妇女提出了一项开展养猪竞赛的倡议。
    倡议的竞赛条件是：一、1957年内，保证平均每户最少养两头猪，争取达到三头；二、要饲养足够的母猪，繁殖小猪，做到自繁自养；三、有计划地适当开垦荒地或适当留出熟地多种饲料，使每头猪能有一分到三分固定的饲料基地，并利用空隙地，每人种植南瓜五株，利用湖、塘大量繁殖水浮莲，广泛开辟饲料来源；四、保证做好猪的卫生防疫工作。
    倡议书说，多养猪不仅能解决肉食问题，而且能增加肥料，一头猪就是一个小肥料厂，养猪多肥料也多，农业就能增产。而养猪主要是由妇女担负起来。我们有信心做到上面四点，希望全省妇女都能这样做，来开展一个养猪竞赛。
