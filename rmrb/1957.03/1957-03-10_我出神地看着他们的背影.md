    I Stared Intently at Their Backs…
    Geng Fu
    On Sunday, the Foreign Languages Department of Xinhua Bookstore was packed. I squeezed to the magazine rack, and a young man in a turn-down collar coat, with parted hair, watched me for a while and politely asked me:
      “Excuse me, are you Captain Tang?”
    I looked at him in surprise, and from the few black spots on his face, I suddenly remembered who he was: "Oh, are you Little Hu?"
    He grabbed my hand and said excitedly: “You still recognize me? You’re wearing glasses, I almost didn't recognize you."
    He said to a woman who was reading a book at the bookshelf on the other side: “Big Sister, come over here, this is Captain Tang I told you about.” He then introduced me: “This is my Big Sister, named Hu Danyun.” The woman walked over and shook my hand warmly, saying: “Oh, Captain Tang, hello! Little Hu often talks about you….”
    In 1948, on the eve of the Huaihai Campaign, I was a captain in a guerrilla unit. We were ordered to advance from eastern Guangdong to western Fujian to develop work. On a night in early winter, we held a mass meeting in a base village in the border area between Fujian and Guangdong to carry out rent and interest reduction work. After the meeting, we performed the Yangko opera "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland" for the first time. The masses felt it was very novel and interesting. Young men, holding hoes and carrying dung baskets on their shoulders, also danced along. In the joyful crowd, there was a fifteen or sixteen-year-old boy, sallow and thin, wearing a coarse homespun jacket, covered with patches, with two pockets hanging in front of his chest. One was already broken, and the other pocket contained about a dozen copper coins. The pants he wore had large openings on both sides right next to the knees and turned like a flag in the wind. There was a broken hole in the seat of his pants. Although it was early winter, he was still barefoot. His hair was as messy as a bunch of weeds. There were a few black spots on his thin face. His dry, small hands held a large, round, old copper tray with more than a dozen fried cakes on it, leftovers from selling them. He squeezed through the crowd, sometimes getting in front of our instructor, grabbing his hand, touching his Browning pistol, and saying affectionately: “Instructor, I don’t want to sell fried cakes anymore, can I go with you to be a messenger?” His eyes flickered, hoping to be answered immediately.
    At that time, we were expanding the army. We had just arrived, and we wrote a large horizontal slogan on the big wall at the market: “Poor people want to turn over, join the People’s Liberation Army.” From eastern Guangdong to western Fujian, the new areas were opened up very quickly, and we didn't have enough manpower. Several young boys who didn't meet the qualifications were equipped with weapons to be soldiers in the team. The instructor looked at the boy's pleading eyes and smiled as he asked him this and that. He answered very smartly: “I’m sixteen years old, I don’t have a father anymore, I have a mother at home who makes bamboo hats to sell. And a younger brother, ten years old; a younger sister, seven years old; I studied for two or three years when I was a child, and I know a few characters. I can endure any hardship.…”
    The next day, the instructor asked me to go to his home to find out the situation and ask his mother for her opinion. I walked into a broken temple. In the temple, there was a statue of the Goddess of Mercy of the South Sea, and the incense burner was covered with cobwebs. A woman in her forties was sitting in front of the Goddess’s hall weaving a bamboo hat. The boy was helping her with something. Seeing me walk in, he leaned next to her and said:
  “Mom, I want to join the army!… This is Captain Tang.” I asked her if she agreed. She didn't speak for a long time, and then she said softly: “If you want to go, then go.” As soon as she uttered these words, her eyes turned red, and tears fell. It turned out that she was an immigrant. They fled to western Fujian in 1941, when the Japanese army occupied Chao-Shan and there was a great famine in eastern Guangdong. That year, her sixteen-year-old eldest daughter (that is, the woman I met in the bookstore), because of the famine, was sold for three dou of rice to a human trafficker, so she felt sad when she remembered it. But when she saw that the people in our guerrilla unit were having fun and laughing every day, and she also heard that they would distribute land, cattle, and houses in the future, she smiled through her tears. In this way, Little Hu joined the army. …
    Now, looking at Little Hu, whom I had not seen for eight years, I was so excited that I didn't know what to say. Who would have thought that this high-spirited, energetic young man was the frail little boy back then?
    Little Hu spoke first:
    “What department are you in now?”
    “I have been in the cultural and educational department for the past few years.”
    “Then we are in the same line of work, I am doing translation work at the radio station.”
    “Which station are you at?”
    “At × place ×× station, we came to buy books. Speaking of which, it's really a coincidence! My sister and I haven't communicated for fifteen years, and I didn’t expect that we would meet at the radio station. Our reunion is like a story written in a novel.”
    Little Hu excitedly briefly described his sister's experiences over the past ten years. She had gone through the hands of three men and had three children with two men. After the land reform, she jumped out of the family circle, entered the Workers’ and Peasants’ Rapid Course Middle School to study, and then transferred to the Foreign Language College to study. Now, she is responsible for English broadcasting at the radio station. She is also self-studying Russian in her spare time and can already read Russian originals. In recent years, she has been wholeheartedly pursuing knowledge. “Compared to my sister, I am still behind. My translation work has not made any outstanding achievements,” he said with some emotion.
    Only then did I notice that she was holding several newly bought English periodicals: "Soviet Literature", "Labour Monthly", "People's China"..., and also a Russian original book of Gorky's "My Universities". She wore a commemorative badge for active participants in socialist construction on her chest. The younger brother looked at his watch and said to his sister, “It's almost time to drive, let's go to the station.”
    After a tight handshake, I stared intently at their backs mingled in the crowd….

    我出神地看着他们的背影……
    耿夫
    星期天，新华书店外文部，简直挤得水泄不通。我挤到杂志架前，一个穿翻领大衣、梳着分头的青年男子，注视了我一会，很有礼貌地问我：
      “请问你可是唐队长吗？”
    我惊奇地望着他，从他脸上的几点黑斑，忽然想起他是谁：“噢，你可是小胡？”
    他一把拉住我的手，激动地说：“你还认得我？你带上眼镜，有点不敢认了。” 
    他向在另一边书架前看书的一个女子说：“大姊，快过来，这位就是我对你讲过的唐队长。”他一面又向我介绍：“这就是我的大姊，叫胡丹云。”这位女子走过来，也热情地握着我的手说：“噢，唐队长，你好呵！小胡常常说到你……。”
    1948年淮海战役前夕，我在一支游击队里当队长，我们奉命从粤东挺进闽西开辟工作。在一个初冬的夜晚，我们在闽粤边区的一个基点村开群众大会，开展减租减息工作。开完大会，我们第一次演出秧歌剧“兄妹开荒”。群众看了，感到十分新鲜、有趣，年青的小伙子们，手里拿着锄头、肩上挑了粪箕也跟着扭起来。在欢乐的人群中，有一个十五、六岁的少年，面黄肌瘦，穿着一件粗土布褂子，肩上满是补钉，襟前吊着两个口袋，一个已经坏了，另一个口袋里约莫装着十几个铜板。下身的裤子正对着膝头边有一对大口，一转动就像一面旗子似地飘来飘去，屁股后面是破窟窿。虽然初冬了，却还赤着一双脚。头发像一把野草一样乱蓬蓬的。尖瘦的脸上有几点黑斑。干枯的小手上捧了一个大圆的旧铜盘，上面放着十多个油炸糕，是卖剩的。他从人群中挤来挤去，一会挤到我们指导员的面前，拉住我们指导员的手，摸着他的驳壳枪，亲热地说：“指导员，我不卖油炸糕了，我跟你去当通讯员好吗？”他的眼睛一闪一闪地眨着，希望马上答应他。
    当时我们正在扩军。我们刚到达不久，便在圩边的大墙上写上了
  “穷人要翻身，参加解放军”的大幅横标语。从粤东到闽西，新区开辟得很快，人手越来越不够，几个不够条件的小鬼也配了武器给他们在队里当战士。指导员看着这个小鬼的祈求眼光，笑着向他问这问那。他很机灵地回答着：“十六岁啦，没有了父亲，家里有个母亲，在编竹笠卖。还有一个弟弟，十岁；一个妹妹，七岁；小时候读过二、三年书，认得几个字。什么苦都吃得。……”
    第二天指导员叫我到他家里去了解，并征求他母亲的意见。我走进一间破庙里，庙里供着一尊南海观世音菩萨，香炉四周布满了蛛网。一位四十多岁的妇女坐在菩萨殿前编斗笠。小鬼在帮助她做什么，看见我走进去，便倚在她旁边说：
  “妈，我要去参军！……这是唐队长。”我问她同意不？她半天没说话，后来她才轻轻地说：“你要去就去吧。”刚刚吐出这句话，她眼圈一红，掉落了眼泪。原来她是外来户。他们是1941年日本军队占领潮汕，粤东大饥荒那年，逃到闽西来的。那年她的一个十六岁的大闺女（也就是我在书店遇到的这位女子），由于饥荒，三斗米卖给了一个人口贩子，所以想起来心酸。但是她看到我们游击队的人们整天高高兴兴有说有笑地过日子，又听说将来要分田、分牛、分屋子，也就破涕为笑了。就这样小胡入伍了。……
    现在，我看着阔别八年的小胡，兴奋得不知道说什么好。谁能想到这位意气轩昂、精神饱满的青年就是当年那个瘦弱的小鬼呢？
    还是小胡先说了：
    “你现在那个部门？”
    “这几年都在文教部门。”
    “那我们算是同行啦，我在广播电台搞编译工作。”
    “你在那个台呀？”
    “在×地××台，我们是来买书的。说起来，真是无巧不成书哪！我和姊姊十五年不通音讯了，想不到我们却在电台碰头了。我们的重逢像小说里写的故事一样。”
    小胡激动地简述了他姊姊十多年来的遭遇。她辗转过了三个男人的手，给两个男人生下了三个小孩。土地改革后她跳出家庭圈子，进工农速成中学学习，以后调外国语专科学校学习，现在电台负责英语广播。业余自修俄文，已经可以阅读俄文原著了。几年来，她一心一意追求知识。“比起我姊姊来，我还是落后的。我的编译工作没有作出什么突出的成绩。”他有些感慨地说。
    这时我才注意到她手里拿着几本刚买到的英文报刊：“苏联文学”、“劳动月刊”、“人民中国”……，还有一本高尔基的“我的大学”的俄文原版书。她胸前闪耀着社会主义建设积极分子的纪念章。弟弟看了看表，对姊姊说：“开车时间快到了，车站去吧。”
    紧紧地握手之后，我出神地看着他们的夹杂在人丛中的背影……。
