In a joint statement, Hu Lansheng, Xiong Jinding, Pu Huarong, and Liu Qingyang said: The Red Cross is a mass voluntary health and rescue organization, based on membership. This characteristic and its humanitarian historical tradition give it many advantages in carrying out mass health activities.

We fully support the reports of Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li, Vice Premier Chen, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and are willing to implement them in our practical work. Please allow us to talk about strengthening mass health work and giving full play to the role of the Chinese Red Cross.

Health work is a major matter related to the health and lives of all the people. The Party and the government have always attached importance to this work. As early as the beginning of the founding of the country, the four principles of "prevention first, serving workers, peasants and soldiers, uniting Chinese and Western medicine, and combining health work with the masses" were established. Over the past seven years, under the correct leadership and care of the Party and the government, the people's health undertaking has made great achievements. Whether in cities or villages, sanitation has been greatly improved, and flies and mosquitoes have been greatly reduced, even resulting in "fly-free cities" and "mosquito-free villages." Several malignant infectious diseases, including cholera, smallpox, relapsing fever, and typhus, have either been eliminated or significantly reduced. However, unhygienic habits and a lack of sanitary and scientific knowledge left over from the old society still exist. There are still many people, whether workers, peasants, urban residents, or even government cadres, who do not understand hygiene, thus increasing the chances of disease transmission. Precisely because of this, many diseases are still prevalent in our country, such as dysentery, malaria, measles, diphtheria, scarlet fever, epidemic encephalitis B, parasitic diseases, and certain occupational diseases, etc. The number of cases has not decreased, and in some areas is still rising. This seriously endangers the lives and health of the people, and directly affects industrial and agricultural production.

This situation must be changed. To change this situation, we must comprehensively implement the policy of prevention first, mobilize the broad masses to pay attention to hygiene, gradually improve the health knowledge of the broad masses, gradually change unhygienic habits, regularly carry out personal and environmental sanitation work, and organize to fight against various diseases, so as to gradually achieve the goal of prevention. But there is a difficulty here, which is how to continuously increase the masses' health knowledge and regularly carry out health activities. Of course, health administration departments, health and epidemic prevention institutions, and medical institutions can and should do this work, but their personnel are limited and each has its own specialty. If they are constantly engaged in organizing mass health activities, it will inevitably cause tension, chaos, and neglect of other things. Therefore, mass health activities should be carried out by relying on mass organizations under the leadership of the health department and the guidance of science and technology.

In view of this situation, we feel that the Red Cross organization should be developed to make it a link between the government health department and the masses and an assistant in carrying out mass health activities.

As everyone knows, the Red Cross is a mass voluntary health and rescue organization, based on membership. This characteristic and its humanitarian historical tradition give it many advantages in carrying out mass health activities. It can organize activists who have emerged in the patriotic health campaign by developing members and establishing grassroots organizational forms, and cultivate more health activists through planned training and organized publicity work. Absorbing the masses as Red Cross members can strengthen the masses' sense of honor, responsibility, and organizational awareness in doing health work. Regular and extensive health training and publicity can popularize health knowledge, make the masses understand the benefits of doing hygiene, and know how to do a good job in hygiene, so that they can consciously and voluntarily take action.

This advantage of the Red Cross has been fully demonstrated in the actual activities of Red Cross societies in various places.

In March of last year, when Beijing launched the rat-catching campaign month, more than 26,000 Red Cross members in the streets of just seven districts caught more than 37,000 rats, and more than 2,000 members caught more than five rats each. Some streets in Guangzhou established Red Cross grassroots organizations, mobilized health workers—Red Cross health workers—who had received health training to regularly carry out health propaganda and spray disinfectant, and the density of mosquitoes and flies was significantly reduced. The local health department reported that: wherever Red Cross organizations are established, the patriotic health campaign becomes regular. In Kaifeng City last year, 283 individual models for eliminating the four pests and the patriotic health campaign were selected, and Red Cross members accounted for 85%. These examples show that Red Cross members played an active leading role in the patriotic health campaign and are the basic force for promoting the patriotic health campaign.

The Tianjin Oils and Fats Company Processing Plant established a Red Cross health station in March of last year. Red Cross health workers regularly publicize hygiene, and workers generally wash their hands before meals, pay attention to wearing clothes when leaving the workshop, and improve dietary hygiene. The incidence of disease among employees has gradually decreased. The number of outpatient visits to the factory's health station has decreased from 40 per day to about a dozen. Since the No. 4 Middle School in Wuxi established a Red Cross health station and launched health activities, the number of internal medicine patients in the summer of last year decreased from an average of 60 per day to an average of 20, compared with the same period in previous years. The Qingdao Red Cross trained a group of family caregivers among the family members of employees of the brewery, assigned them to each family group to take charge of health work, and assisted the factory's physicians in carrying out various health activities. The outpatient rate of the family members of the factory decreased from more than two-thirds of the employee outpatient rate to less than one-fifth. These examples show that strengthening the work of the Red Cross is an effective way to implement preventive measures.

In the fight against epidemic prevention and elimination of diseases, Red Cross members are the vanguards of medical personnel. Some Red Cross grassroots organizations in Tianjin have established an epidemic reporting network based on member groups. If an epidemic is discovered, the local clinic is immediately notified, and the patient's family is helped to carry out disinfection and isolation. Since the Red Cross grassroots organization in Xing'an Road Street, Tianjin, has been responsible for epidemic reporting, not a single epidemic has been missed, and not a single child has died. Red Cross members and health workers in Hangzhou, Wuxi, Nanjing and other places, after receiving short-term training, assisted medical personnel in conducting general surveys and publicity on schistosomiasis, mobilizing patients to seek medical treatment, and doing "two controls and one elimination", antigen skin tests, stool incubation, and other work.

In terms of first aid and dealing with accidental injuries, Red Cross members have displayed the spirit of revolutionary humanitarianism and have been widely welcomed by the masses. For example, the seven underground Red Cross health stations in the Jiaozuo Lifeng Coal Mine provided first aid to a total of 1,020 people in two months last year, reducing the suffering of workers and saving the country a lot of working hours. In Shantou City, there were two major fires in August last year, and each time 200 to 300 Red Cross health workers rushed to the disaster site to rescue people, rescuing a total of 1,015 people, and rescuing four children and two old women from the raging fire. The Shuncheng Street Red Cross health station in Xidan District, Beijing, treated a total of 199 minor and serious injuries from January to July last year. A comrade from the joint canteen there said: "We can't live without this health station for a day."

From the above examples, we believe that the Red Cross organization is an effective organizational form for assisting government health departments in mobilizing the masses to regularly do a good job in sanitation. From the point of view of economy, using the Red Cross organizational form, mobilizing some Red Cross members to handle mass health work without leaving their posts, and relying on a part of the membership dues to carry out health activities, is more effective than completely relying on the state to provide people and money to run mass health undertakings.

At present, there are 14 provincial Red Cross societies, 3 municipal Red Cross societies directly under the central government, 136 city and county Red Cross societies, more than 3,600 grassroots organizations and more than 5,600 Red Cross health stations in the country. In recent years, more than 400,000 Red Cross health workers have been trained, and more than 400,000 Red Cross members have been developed last year. However, due to uneven development, the Red Cross work has not been universally valued by the Party and government leading organs in various places. Some health departments in some areas do not have a sufficient understanding of the role of the Red Cross, and the difficulties and problems existing in the Red Cross in some areas have not been properly resolved, so that the role of the Red Cross has not been fully brought into play. This situation not only affects the development of mass health work in our country, but will also invisibly affect the socialist construction of our country. There are now 75 countries in the world that have Red Cross societies, and they are generally very developed. The Soviet Red Cross has more than 20 million members, and Bulgaria, with a population of only 7 million, also has more than 1 million Red Cross members. In order to do a good job in the health work of the people, in order to promote the spirit of revolutionary humanitarianism, the Red Cross cause should move forward. We hope that the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the local committees of the CPPCC and all relevant parties, especially the health departments and medical and health workers, will give more guidance, assistance and support, so that this mass organization of the Red Cross can give full play to its role in the great socialist construction cause of the motherland.

### 加强红十字会的工作是贯彻预防措施的有效办法

    加强红十字会的工作是贯彻预防措施的有效办法
    胡兰生、熊瑾玎、浦化人、刘清扬在联合发言中说：红十字会是群众自愿组织的卫生救护团体，是以会员为基础的组织。它的这种性能和它的人道主义的历史传统，使它在进行群众卫生活动方面有许多便利条件。
    我们完全拥护毛主席、周总理、李副总理、陈副总理和陈叔通副主席的各个报告，并愿意在实际工作中把它贯彻下去。请让我们来谈谈加强群众卫生工作与充分发挥中国红十字会的作用的问题。
    卫生工作是关系全体人民健康和生命的大事。党和政府一向重视这项工作。早在建国之初，即确定了预防为主、面向工农兵、团结中、西医和卫生工作与群众相结合的四大原则。七年来，在党和政府的正确领导和关怀下，人民卫生事业有了巨大的成就。无论城市或乡村，卫生状况都有了很大的改进，苍蝇蚊子大大减少了，甚至出现了“无蝇城”和“无蚊村”。几种恶性传染病加霍乱、天花、回归热、斑疹伤寒等，有的已经消灭有的显著减少。但是旧社会所遗留下来的不卫生习惯和卫生科学知识落后的现象仍然存在。由于不懂得讲卫生，从而为疾病增加传播机会的人，不论在工人、农民、城市居民、甚至机关干部中却还是很多的。正因为如此，我国目前还流行着很多疾病，如赤痢、疟疾、麻疹、白喉、猩红热、流行性“乙型”脑炎、寄生虫病和某些职业病等等，发病数字没有降低，而在某些地区还在上升。这就严重的危害着人民的生命和健康，同时也就直接影响到工农业的生产。
    这种情况必须改变。要改变这种情况，就必须全面贯彻预防为主的方针，就必须发动广大群众起来讲究卫生，使广大人民群众的卫生知识逐渐提高，不卫生的习惯逐渐改变，经常地进行个人卫生和环境卫生工作，并组织起来与各种疾病作斗争，以逐步达到预防的目的。但是这里有一个困难，就是怎样使群众不断的增加卫生知识，经常的进行卫生活动。当然，卫生行政部门、卫生防疫机构、医疗机构都可以而且应该做这个工作，可是它们的人员有限而且各有专业，如果经常来做群众卫生活动的组织工作，势必造成紧张忙乱顾此失彼。因此，群众卫生活动应该是在卫生部门的领导下和科学技术的指导下依靠群众组织来做。
    针对这种情况，我们觉得应该发展红十字会组织，使它成为政府卫生部门联系群众的纽带和开展群众卫生活动的助手。
    大家知道，红十字会是群众自愿组织的卫生救护团体，是以会员为基础的组织。它的这种性能和它的人道主义的历史传统，使它在进行群众卫生活动方面具有许多便利条件。它可以通过发展会员和建立基层组织形式把爱国卫生运动中涌现出的积极分子组织起来，并通过有计划的训练和有组织的宣传工作，培养更多的卫生积极分子。吸收群众为红十字会会员，可以加强群众对搞卫生工作的光荣感、责任心和组织观念。经常而又广泛的卫生训练和宣传，可以普及卫生知识，使群众懂得搞卫生的好处，并知道如何搞好卫生，从而可以自觉自愿地行动起来。
    红十字会的这种优点，在各地红十字会的实际活动中已经得到充分证明。
    去年3月，北京市开展捕鼠运动月时，仅七个区街道上的红十字会会员二万六千多人就捕鼠三万七千多只，有两千多个会员每人捕鼠五只以上。广州市一些街道建立起红十字基层组织，发动受过卫生训练的会员——红十字卫生员经常做卫生宣传及喷射消毒药剂，蚊蝇密度就显著下降。当地卫生部门反映说：凡建立红十字组织的街道，爱国卫生运动就经常化了。开封市去年评选除四害和爱国卫生运动个人模范二百八十三名，红十字会会员就占了85％。这些事例说明：红十字会会员在爱国卫生运动中起了积极带头作用，是推动爱国卫生运动的基本力量。
    天津市油脂公司加工厂自去年3月建立了红十字卫生站，红十字卫生员经常宣传卫生，一般工人都做到饭前洗手，出车间注意穿衣服，并改善了饮食卫生，职工发病率就逐步降低了，该厂保健站门诊人数由每天四十人减少到十来个人。无锡市第四中学自建立起红十字卫生站，展开卫生活动以后，去年夏季与往年同期比较，内科病人从平均每日六十人下降到平均二十人。青岛市红十字会在啤酒厂职工家属中训练了一批家庭护理员，分配到每个家属小组掌握卫生工作，协助该厂医师进行各项卫生活动，该厂家属门诊率就由原占职工门诊率三分之二强下降到五分之一弱。这些事例说明：加强红十字会工作是贯彻预防措施的有效办法。
    在防疫和消灭疾病的斗争中，红十字会会员是医务人员的尖兵。天津市的一些红十字基层组织已以会员小组为基础建立了疫情报告网，发现疫情立即报告地段诊所，并帮助患者家属进行消毒隔离。天津市兴安路街，自红十字基层组织担任疫情报告以后，就没有一个疫情遗漏，没有死一个孩子。杭州、无锡、南京等地的红十字会会员、卫生员在受过短期训练后，就协助医务人员作有关血吸虫病的普查、宣传，动员病人就医，以及作“两管一灭”，抗原皮内试验，大便孵化等等工作。
    在急救和处理意外伤害方面，红十字会会员发挥了革命人道主义精神，受到群众的普遍欢迎。如焦作李封煤矿七个井下红十字卫生站，去年两个月共急救一千零二十人次，使工人少受痛苦，并为国家节省了许多工时。汕头市去年8月间发生两次大火灾，每次都有二、三百名红十字卫生员驰赴灾场抢救，共救护一千零一十五人，并从烈火中抢救了四个小孩两个老妇脱险。北京市西单区顺城街红十字卫生站去年1月至7月共处理轻重伤患一百九十九起。该处联合食堂的一位同志说：“我们一天也离不了这个卫生站。”
    从以上所举的事例，我们认为红十字会组织是协助政府卫生部门发动群众经常搞好卫生工作的一种有效的组织形式。从节约观点来看，运用红十字会组织形式，动员一些红十字会会员不脱产的办理群众卫生工作，和依靠一部分会费来举办卫生活动，这比之完全由国家出人出钱来办群众卫生事业也有事半功倍之效。
    现在全国共有十四个省红十字会，三个直辖市红十字会，一百三十六个市县红十字会，三千六百多个基层组织和五千六百多个红十字卫生站。几年来，共训练了四十多万红十字卫生员，去年又发展了四十多万个红十字会会员。但是由于发展不平衡，红十字工作还未被各地党政领导机关普遍重视，有些地区卫生部门对于红十字会的作用还认识不足，以及有些地区红十字会所存在的困难问题还未得到妥善解决，从而使红十字会的作用没有充分发挥出来。这种情况不仅影响到我国群众卫生工作的开展，也会无形中影响我国社会主义的建设。现在世界上已有七十五个国家有红十字会，一般的都很发达。苏联红十字会已有两千多万会员，只有七百多万人口的保加利亚也有红十字会会员一百多万人。为了搞好人民群众卫生工作，为了发扬革命人道主义精神，红十字会事业应该向前发展。我们希望人民政协全国委员会与各地政协委员会和各有关方面，特别是卫生部门，医药卫生工作者多给予指导、协助和支持，使红十字会这个群众团体在祖国的伟大社会主义建设事业中充分发挥它的作用。（附图片）
