Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, March 7th: This year, Jilin Province plans to produce six million tons of grain and soybeans; the average yield per hectare is required to increase by 250 *jin* based on the "Three Fixes" (三定) production targets. In order to achieve this plan and strive for a bumper harvest by every possible means, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a rural work conference from February 27th to March 4th to discuss and deploy rural work.

    The meeting pointed out that agricultural cooperatives in various regions are currently formulating production plans from the bottom up, adapting to local conditions, to ensure the production of soybeans, grains, feed crops, and local staple grains such as millet and small beans needed by the state and cooperative members. However, after correcting the tendency of leading bodies to restrict the production plans of agricultural cooperatives too rigidly, some areas have shown a tendency to excessively emphasize the needs of the cooperatives while neglecting the needs of the state. In response to this situation, the meeting required all regions to conduct patriotic education among agricultural cooperative members, emphasizing prioritizing the public interest before personal interests, and resolutely guarantee the planting of economic crops such as soybeans and sugar beets needed by national industry and for export. In the face of difficulties, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to find ways to overcome them. The meeting particularly emphasized that in the plain areas that are rich in soybeans and suffered from floods last year, cadres and the masses should not merely be satisfied with "having enough to eat and land to cultivate" this year, but should take advantage of the favorable conditions in the second year of cooperation to strive for a bumper harvest of soybeans and other crops.

    The meeting proposed many measures to increase production and strive for a bumper harvest this year. One important measure is to require the entire province to cultivate more than 100,000 *hectares* of paddy fields. The meeting pointed out that paddy fields are not only suitable for planting rice, but also for experimenting with irrigated soybean fields. Baicheng and Ji'an counties have experience in obtaining high yields from irrigated soybeans. While expanding paddy fields, efforts should also be made to increase the yield of dry land. Secondly, the meeting affirmed the need to actively promote advanced technical experience, but also to promote the local inherent mature farming experience, and not to confuse inherent experience with the old-fashioned conservatism.

    The meeting also required all regions to correctly handle the relationship between agricultural cooperatives and cooperative members in order to leverage the enthusiasm of cooperative members and complete the task of increasing grain production. The meeting pointed out that since the counties issued announcements requiring agricultural cooperatives to delineate the different sideline business scopes of the cooperatives and the cooperative members, and to properly arrange the personal production time of the cooperative members, some cooperative members have planned to reserve more land for self-cultivation of fertilizer-consuming crops. The meeting believed that this situation should be noted. Cooperatives should not only enthusiastically help cooperative members solve the difficulties in household sideline production, but also use persuasive education methods to make cooperative members realize the consistency between collective interests and personal interests, in order to prevent lax labor discipline from hindering collective production.

    The county party secretaries, county heads, township party branch secretaries, and some agricultural cooperative directors who participated in the meeting conducted a heated discussion on this year's agricultural production tasks and unanimously agreed to launch a province-wide production increase competition movement to strive for a bumper harvest.

    在制订生产计划时，不能忽视国家的利益
    吉林争取生产粮食、大豆六百万吨
    新华社吉林7日电　今年吉林省计划生产六百万吨粮食和大豆；平均每垧地的粮食产量要求在“三定”产量的基础上增产二百五十斤。为了实现这个计划，千方百计地争取大丰收，中共吉林省委在2月27日到3月4日召开了农村工作会议，讨论和部署了农村工作。
    会议指出：当前各地农业社正在自下而上因地制宜地制订生产计划，以保证国家和社员需要的大豆、粮食、饲料作物和当地习惯吃用的大黄米、小豆等小杂粮的生产。但是有些地区在纠正了领导机关对农业社的生产计划限制过死的偏向以后，又出现了过分强调社内需要，忽视国家需要的偏向。针对这种情况，会议要求各地要向农业社社员进行爱国主义先公后私的教育，坚决保证种植国家工业和出口需要的大豆、甜菜等经济作物。在困难面前要发动群众想法克服困难。会议特别强调：盛产大豆去年又遭受水灾的平原地区，今年干部和群众不能仅仅满足于“吃上饭种上地”，要利用合作化第二年的有利条件，争取大豆和其他作物获得大丰收。
    会议提出很多争取今年大丰收的增产措施。其中重要的一项是，要求全省开垦水田十万垧以上。会议指出，水田不仅种植水稻，还可以试行水浇大豆地。白城、辑安两县都有水浇大豆获得高产量的经验。在扩大水田的同时，也要努力提高旱田产量。其次，会议肯定要积极推广先进技术经验，但也要推广当地固有的成熟的耕作经验，不能把固有经验和老一套的保守主义混为一谈。
    会议还要求各地要正确处理农业社和社员的关系问题，以便发挥社员积极性，完成粮食增产任务。会议指出：自从各县发了布告，要求农业社划分社和社员不同的副业经营范围妥善安排社员个人生产时间以后，有些社员便打算多留地自种费工作物。会议认为这种情况应该引起注意。合作社既要热心帮助社员解决家庭副业生产的困难，也应用说服教育的方法，让社员认识到集体利益和个人利益的一致性，以防止劳动纪律松懈妨碍集体生产。
    参加会议的各中共县委书记、县长、中共乡总支书记和一些农业社主任，对今年的农业生产任务进行了热烈的讨论之后，都一致同意在全省开展一个争取大丰收的增产竞赛运动。
