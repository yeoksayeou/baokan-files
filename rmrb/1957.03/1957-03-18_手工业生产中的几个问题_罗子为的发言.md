I wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao's instructions on how to handle contradictions among the people and Premier Zhou's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries. I also agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of the recommendations for the Second Five-Year Plan and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

I will discuss several major issues related to handicrafts as far as I know.

General Situation

Over 90% of the national handicraft practitioners who have been transformed by the national handicraft departments have been organized into various forms of handicraft cooperatives. Most of the handicraft cooperatives were organized during the high tide in the spring of 1956. The time is not long, and the foundation is certainly not solid enough, but after being organized, some have improved their management, some have appropriately improved their tools and equipment, and most have launched labor competitions and organized the exchange of advanced experiences. Some have actively carried out mutual teaching and learning, improving their skills. Moreover, many regions, in order to do a good job in production, have selected technicians to go to other regions to learn excellent technologies and advanced experiences. In the past year alone, nearly a thousand skilled technicians from handicraft cooperatives in various regions were sent to Shanghai handicraft cooperatives to study. As a result, many handicraft enterprises have increased labor productivity by 10%, 20%, or even 30% after being organized. Some have improved and increased the variety of designs and colors, improved product quality, and reduced costs. On the basis of doing a good job in production, most members have increased their labor income. According to surveys in many regions in the fourth quarter of 1956, about 70% of the members of handicraft cooperatives across the country have increased their labor income compared to the past (new members compared to before joining the cooperative, old members compared to 1955). After wage adjustments in cooperatives, more than 90% of the members increased their labor income. For example, during my investigation in Xiamen, Fujian last winter, 93% of the more than 2,900 members of the handicraft cooperatives in the city who were centrally managed and unified accounted for had increased their labor income compared to the past. Most handicraft cooperatives, based on their production situation and economic conditions, have established unified medical care or medical subsidies. As a result, many handicraft workers have improved their lives to a certain extent because of collectivization, demonstrating the superiority of being organized. Many handicraft workers said, "In the past, we worried about buying (referring to raw materials) and selling (referring to product sales) every day, and we often worried about what to do tomorrow." "Now we don't worry about buying or selling, we only worry that our production can't keep up with the labor competition." This reflects the mood of the collectivized handicraft workers and also reflects the enthusiasm of handicraft workers for production. This is of course due to the leadership of the local Party committees, the promotion of handicraft departments, and the enthusiasm of handicraft workers in actively participating in socialism, as well as the strong assistance of relevant departments such as commercial departments and financial institutions. Although the handicraft transformation work has yielded great results, it does not mean that the handicraft transformation work has no shortcomings. For example, some of the handicraft cooperatives organized during the high tide of socialist transformation in the spring of 1956 were too large, some were too concentrated and merged, and some unified accounting was inappropriate, which brought some inconvenience to society and handicraft workers. However, after the high tide, this problem was quickly discovered. After the instructions of the Party Central Committee, the handicraft departments immediately began to adjust and change some inappropriate organizational forms, and achieved certain results. Currently, some regions are still continuing to adjust. Due to the poverty and diseases brought about by the history of the vast number of handicraft workers, and also because some have large populations, and some are not doing well in their business, it is not possible to improve the lives and difficulties of all people in a very short time. At present, there are still a few households in difficulty. According to my investigation in Zhangzhou City, Fujian last year, about 5% of the members of the handicraft cooperatives have difficulties in their lives and need relief. Because most handicraft cooperatives have not been established for a long time and have a weak economic foundation, this relief work still requires the strong assistance of the civil affairs departments and relief departments. Some regions have provided great assistance to the civil affairs departments, such as Xiamen City. Last winter, the civil affairs department allocated 4,000 yuan for winter relief in November and December, and also issued cotton clothes and quilts to some particularly difficult households. From a national perspective, this work still needs further assistance from civil affairs departments in various regions.

Handicrafts are scattered and fragmented, highly localized, and extremely complex in industry, involving a wide range of aspects, and have historically brought poverty. Therefore, there are many problems and difficulties in handicrafts. Here, I will talk about several major problems and difficulties currently existing in handicrafts.

Difficulty in Purchasing Raw Materials

First of all, let's talk about the supply of raw materials: The raw materials used in handicrafts mainly come from three sources: one is local raw materials, purchased locally; the second is the use of various waste materials; and the third is materials uniformly distributed by the state, such as cotton yarn. As for purchasing raw materials from distant places and importing raw materials, the proportion is relatively small. According to my investigation in Zhangzhou City, Fujian last year, in addition to the raw materials uniformly distributed by the state (mainly cotton yarn), about 90% of the raw materials needed by the handicraft cooperatives in Zhangzhou City are purchased from the local area and nearby counties (of which a very small number are transported from distant places by commercial departments). The current problem is that commercial departments purchase raw materials produced in some areas, and often purchase them very thoroughly, or some areas do not purchase enough, and restrictions are very rigid. The raw materials needed by handicrafts cannot be purchased from farmers, and sometimes even secondary materials cannot be purchased directly, but must be through the hands of commercial departments. Sometimes the prices are often too high, some raw materials are not suitable, some local raw materials are transported out in large quantities, and the local area has difficulty in using materials. Some local raw materials are transported from the countryside to the city, and the handicraft cooperatives in the raw material producing areas have to buy them from the city or storage stations and transport them back, simply increasing unnecessary operating costs, wasting transportation manpower, and sometimes even causing losses of raw materials. Since the proposal to open up the free market in the second half of last year, some local raw materials in some areas have been improved, but the problem has not been well resolved in some areas. All raw materials that must be uniformly distributed by the state should be purchased and sold exclusively by the state. Some local raw materials that are not uniformly purchased and distributed by the state but are purchased should be given reasonable prices and allow handicraft cooperatives to purchase them directly. Even if some raw materials need to be transported to other places for adjustment, attention should first be paid to the needs of local handicraft workers, because the development of certain handicrafts in certain areas is often inseparable from local raw materials. At the same time, even if some raw materials belong to the state's unified purchase, it can also be considered to designate a certain area and a certain variety for handicraft cooperatives to purchase directly to adjust the shortage and supplement the commercial shortcomings. For example, in Shandong, some areas designated areas for handicraft cooperatives to purchase miscellaneous hides when purchasing raw hides, and the effect was very good. Both parties benefited, both utilizing miscellaneous hides and appropriately reducing the use of standard hides. At the same time, the price of raw materials purchased directly by handicraft cooperatives on the spot is almost half lower than that handled by commercial departments. Some good experiences in one area are often not adopted when trying to promote them in another area, on the pretext of "different actual conditions." What exactly are the "different actual conditions"? There is often a lack of analysis, and it is dismissed in one word. In fact, sometimes it may be the "ideological reality" in our minds, not necessarily the real "objective reality," and the phrase "different actual conditions" is sometimes used to cover up the excuse of "failure to understand certain issues" or "lack of in-depth research on certain situations." Regarding the second issue of raw materials, that is, many handicrafts use waste materials for production. This is a characteristic of handicrafts. This characteristic of handicrafts should be actively promoted to fully exploit the potential power of utilizing materials and increase the supply of materials needed by the people, and implement the spirit of the state's increase in production and conservation. In the past, handicraft cooperatives have made many gains in this regard. For example, last year when steel supplies were tight, handicraft cooperatives in some areas of Fujian and Guangdong organized workers to go to the mountains to dig up some earthen cannons buried underground decades ago to produce agricultural tools to support agricultural production. Of course, some handicrafts do not pay enough attention to the use of waste materials. Although many handicrafts can use waste materials, handicraft cooperatives in many places cannot purchase waste materials directly on the spot, which greatly affects the enthusiasm of handicraft workers in using waste materials. Because using waste materials for production is sometimes labor-intensive, it is not as labor-saving as using good materials for production. The price of some waste material products is lower, and the waste material has to be marked up once it is transferred. After the marked-up waste material is used by handicraft workers, it often affects the reduction of income due to labor-intensiveness, so they do not want to use it. Some waste materials are transported out, and the local area wants to use them but cannot get them. It is recommended that handicraft cooperatives across the country should be allowed to directly purchase waste materials for their own use, and handicraft cooperatives in various places should be allowed to adjust each other, which can both fully utilize waste materials and remedy the difficulty of insufficient raw materials for handicrafts. The handicraft department purchases unusable waste materials and turns them over to the state. Some individual waste materials such as copper, which must be uniformly distributed by the state, can be handed over to the state by handicrafts without using or purchasing them. In the national active construction, it is necessary to fully exploit the potential power of utilizing materials. This issue needs to be resolved as soon as possible to give play to the characteristics of handicrafts. Regarding the third issue of raw materials, that is, the raw materials related to unified distribution, some regions have achieved overall consideration between different economic types, but some regions have overall consideration but not enough consideration. For example, in a place with the same technical conditions, state-owned factories or joint state-private factories and handicraft cooperatives sometimes have a difference of more than one time in the monthly allocation of raw materials per person. The gap is too large. It is precisely "some can't finish" and "some don't have enough to do." Here, it essentially involves the issue of how to view handicrafts and the ownership of cooperatives. It is hoped that the regions where this problem exists can be improved, mainly to allocate appropriately and pay attention to the fact that if handicrafts do not produce today, there will be problems in life tomorrow. If they do not produce much in the peak season, difficulties will occur in the off-season. I am not asking for an egalitarian distribution of raw materials.

Low Purchase Price and Processing Fees

Secondly, let's talk about product processing, purchase, and exclusive sales. In order to uniformly control important materials, stabilize the market, and ensure the accumulation of state socialist construction funds, some handicraft products belong to the commercial department for processing, purchase, and exclusive sales. Although there is talk of changing the selection and purchase of some products, it is not simple to implement, and there must be a process. The main problems at present are two: one is that the purchase price or processing fee is too low, which affects the income of members and affects production, such as the purchase price of native paper, some handicrafts, and the processing fee of cotton cloth in some areas are too low; the second is that some products are exclusively sold by the commercial department under the pretext of the commercial system, and other departments are not allowed to intervene, and there are too many links, which also affects the low purchase price or processing fee. For example, the national production of native paper has decreased since 1953, mainly due to the impact of suppressed purchase prices. Since 1953, the price of native paper has generally been suppressed by 20% to 30%, with a maximum of 50%. Some have reduced wages to maintain production, some have lost money, some have changed careers and stopped production, and some cooperatives have collapsed. Even nine out of ten paper-producing counties have stopped production. Although the purchase price of native paper was appropriately adjusted in 1956, because the adjusted price in some regions and some varieties did not reach the level before the price was suppressed, and the general wages of society have risen in recent years, and the price of raw materials used in native paper has also risen, how can we promote increased production? Purchase prices and processing fees must be handled from the spirit of conforming to reality and allocating appropriately. The number of commercial operating links is shockingly high in some places. For example, there are as many as six or seven links from the receipt to the sale of native paper in some areas. It is said to accumulate funds for the country, but in fact, because there are too many circulation links, there is little real profit. Therefore, some cadres are dissatisfied with the excessive number of links and say: "One unification, two transfers, three checkpoints, four handovers, everyone wants to squeeze oil, but there is not much real oil." I suggest that the products purchased and exclusively sold should adopt the method of "direct combination of production and sales," that is, the production units in the producing area directly sell the products to the purchasing commercial units in the main sales area. The products exclusively sold that belong to the export part should be directly sold to the export trade department, without going through the hands of the domestic sales commercial department. The balance allocation arrangement and docking contract work should be done in advance every year. Many products purchased and exclusively sold, such as native paper, have certain sales channels. The main sales area and quantity of a certain product in a certain place have a certain foundation. For example, Ruijin Yukou paper in Jiangxi has always been directly shipped to Guangzhou for export, and Ningdu Mao Bian paper has always gone directly to Shanghai. It is not difficult to do. It can also be selected for trial and gradually promoted; because the balance has been arranged in advance, there will be no competition for purchase, and it will not affect exclusive sales. At the same time, it can greatly reduce unnecessary links and save manpower, material resources, and financial resources. And without affecting the accumulation of national funds and social sales prices, the low purchase price or processing fee can be appropriately adjusted to ensure the producers' due labor income and further play their enthusiasm for production.

The two issues discussed above, on the one hand, involve the proper arrangement of raw materials for handicrafts and the full exploitation of the potential power of materials, and on the other hand, involve how to properly allocate the income of handicraft production between the state, handicraft cooperatives, and handicraft workers. Correctly handling these issues can further strengthen the active development of production by handicraft cooperatives and further give play to the enthusiasm of handicraft workers in building socialism, and it is also to further strengthen the close relationship between the Party and some handicraft workers. At the same time, I want to point out that handicraft cooperatives also have many shortcomings, mainly such as the spontaneous tendencies of small producers and capitalist business ideas. This was particularly prominent in some cooperatives after the free market was opened up in the second half of last year, when the market supply was tight, such as shoddy workmanship and substandard materials, affecting quality, sometimes causing some difficulties for commercial departments, and sometimes causing waste and loss of raw materials. Commercial departments have made great efforts and achieved great results in accumulating funds for the country, organizing material supply, and stabilizing the market in recent years, and they also have many valuable experiences. I believe that in the progress of national construction, these problems will not be difficult to obtain reasonable improvement.

Fully Utilize Handicrafts
Develop Handicrafts

Finally, I would like to talk about the issue of how to view handicrafts. From the task of socialist transformation of handicrafts put forward by the Party and the repeated emphasis on the importance of handicrafts, it seems that this issue does not exist. According to my experience in work, there are still some problems, more or less. For example, when we talk to some people about the technical transformation of handicrafts, some people say: "Now is the era of automation, why are you still doing technical transformation of handicrafts?" Some people also say: "The world's technical level is leaping forward every day, why are you still doing technical transformation of handicrafts, it's really a waste, it's really a waste of effort." Even some people simply say: "Handicrafts will be eliminated sooner or later." Handicrafts are one of the components of local industry. Generally, handicrafts are valued, but some regions are willing to take money to run factories instead of helping to expand the local handicraft cooperatives with existing foundations, which sometimes causes difficulties in production arrangements, difficulties in raw material supply, difficulties in product sales, and even digging handicraft workers, which implicitly reflects that only local state-owned industry is local industry, and handicrafts seem not to count. Of course, the output value of handicrafts is smaller than that of industry and agriculture. Large industry and agriculture of course play a decisive role in the economy, but handicrafts are not dispensable, but indispensable. Handicrafts have many industries, most of them take materials locally, produce locally, and supply locally. Moreover, handicrafts are wide-ranging, flexible, and easy to adapt to changes in social needs. Moreover, some produce exquisite products, which can supplement the shortcomings of large industry. Handicrafts are not only a temporary assistant to large industry, but a long-term assistant. From cities to rural areas, from birth to death, the daily life of clothing, food, housing, transportation, and entertainment, the production tools of the vast agricultural, animal husbandry, and fishing industries, handicraft production tools, and even some parts needed by industry, handicrafts have played an active supply role. In some areas, daily necessities for people's production and life, handicrafts account for 70% to 80%. In many small and medium-sized cities, the so-called industry is mainly handicrafts. At the same time, handicrafts are convenient for arranging labor, require less capital, and produce quick results. At present, it is necessary to study how to actively exploit the characteristics of handicrafts to develop handicraft production, how to arrange reasonably to give play to the role of handicrafts as an assistant to large industry. In the entire industrialization construction process, we should study how to arrange handicrafts properly. Various regions should fully utilize handicrafts, vigorously assist handicrafts, and develop local industry on the basis of fully utilizing and developing handicrafts, which is conducive to the arrangement of labor and supply, production, and sales, and can save national financial resources. Moreover, some handicraft cooperatives need to transition at a certain time when conditions permit. As for the technical transformation of handicrafts, the progress and specific practices of technical transformation of handicrafts should be studied according to the overall spirit of the country's entire production level, technical level, financial resources, and the needs of many laborers for arrangement. Mechanization should be slowed down, and some production in handicrafts may not be mechanized. But this does not mean that handicrafts will not engage in technical transformation or mechanization. Of course, the technical transformation of handicrafts is a complex task. It cannot completely move the entire set of large industry and learn from large factories to engage in automation, but mainly to transform on the basis of the current equipment. At the same time, it is necessary to study its technical transformation path on the basis of maintaining the characteristics of handicrafts. Chairman Mao instructed to mobilize all positive factors to work hard for building socialism. There are tens of millions of handicraft professionals and more part-time personnel. The potential power is great. The vast number of handicraft workers are very enthusiastic about building socialism. We should actively exploit this vast positive factor and potential power to strive for building socialism!

    手工业生产中的几个问题
    罗子为的发言
    我衷心地拥护毛主席关于如何处理人民内部矛盾的指示和周总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告，同时我同意李富春副总理关于第二个五年计划建议的说明和陈叔通副主席关于中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告。
    我谈谈就我所知道的有关手工业的几个主要问题。
    一般情况
    全国手工业从业人员由全国手工业部门改造的90％以上组织起来，成立了各种形式的手工业合作社，大多数手工业合作社是在1956年春高潮中组织起来的，时间不长，基础当然还不够巩固，但组织起来后有的改善了经营管理，有的适当改进了工具和设备，并且大多开展了劳动竞赛，组织先进经验交流，有的积极开展互教互学，提高了技术，而且很多地区为了搞好生产，选派技工到其他地区学习优良技术，学习先进经验，去年不到一年各地手工业合作社选派熟练技工仅到上海手工业合作社去学习的达千余人之多。因而很多手工业组织起来以后，提高了劳动生产率自10％、20％以至30％不等，有的改进并增加了花色品种，提高了产品质量，降低了成本。在搞好生产的基础上大多数社员增加了劳动收入，根据1956年第四季度很多地区的调查，全国手工业合作社社员一般的约70％左右的社员比过去增加了劳动收入（新社员比入社前，老社员比1955年）。经过了工资调整的合作社，有90％以上社员增加了劳动收入，如我去年冬在福建厦门调查，该市集中经营统一核算的手工业合作社调整工资的二千九百多社员，有93％的社员比过去增加了劳动收入。大多数手工业社根据生产情况、经济条件举办了统筹医疗或医疗补助，因而不少手工业者因为合作化而在生活上获得了一定的改善，表现了组织起来的优越性。很多手工业者说：“过去天天愁买（指原料）愁卖（指产品销售），常常今天愁着明天怎么办”？“现在不愁买不愁卖，只愁自己生产赶不上劳动竞赛”。这反映了合作化了的手工业者的心情，也反映了手工业者生产的积极性。这当然由于各地党委的领导、手工业部门的推进，手工业者积极参加社会主义的热情，同时与有关部门如商业部门，金融机关大力协助分不开的。手工业改造工作虽然有很大收获，不等于说手工业改造工作没有缺点，比如在1956年春社会主义改造高潮中组织起来的手工业合作社，其中一部分有的规模过大，有的集中合并过多，有的统一核算不适当，因而给社会上或手工业者带来了一些不便，但在高潮后很快发现了这个问题，党中央指示后手工业部门即积极着手调整，改变了一些不适当的组织形式，并且收到了一定效果，而目前有的地区仍在继续调整中。由于广大手工业者历史上带来的贫困和疾病，而且有的人口众多，也有的由于业务不好，并不是很短时间就能改善了所有人的生活和困难，目前还有少数困难户。据我去年在福建漳州市的调查，手工业合作社中约有5％左右的社员生活有困难，需要救济。由于多数手工业合作社成立时间不久，经济基础薄弱，这一救济工作尚需民政部门救济部门大力协助，而有些地区民政部门给予了很大协助，如厦门市去年冬民政部门拨出四千元作十一、十二两月冬季救济，有的特别困难户并且发给了棉衣棉被。这一工作从全国来看，尚须各地民政部门进一步协助。
    手工业分散零星，地方性大，行业极为复杂，牵涉方面广历史上又带来贫困，因而手工业问题较多，困难较多。这里我说说手工业目前存在的几个主要问题和困难。
    采购原料困难很多
    首先说说原料供应问题：手工业用的原料主要来自三方面，一为地产原料，就地购买；二为利用各种废料；三为国家统一分配物资，如棉纱。至于向远地购买原料及进口原料比重较小。根据我去年在福建漳州市调查，除国家统一分配原料外（主要是棉纱），漳州市手工业合作社所需原料约90％购自本地及附近各县（其中有很小数是商业部门从远地运来的），目前的问题是有些地区产出原料商业部门收购，而往往收购得很彻底，或者有的地区收购不足，而限制很死，手工业所需的原料不能向农民购买，甚至有时连次料也不能够直接购买，必须经过商业部门之手。有的往往加价过高，有的原料不适用，有的地产原料大量外运，当地反而发生用料的困难，有的地产原料从乡运到城，而原料产地的手工业合作社又要从城里或储存站去买再搬运回去，徒以增加不必要的经营费用、浪费搬运人力以及有时甚至于造成原材料损耗。自去年下半年提出开放自由市场后，有些地区有些地产原料虽然有所改进，但问题在有些地区还没有获得很好地解决。凡是必须由国家统一分配的原料应该统购统销，有些不属于国家统购统一分配原料而属于收购的地产原料，应该规定合理价格，允许手工业合作社直接购买，即使某些原料需要运到其他地方调剂，应该首先注意当地手工业者的需要，因为某些地区某些手工业的发达，往往与地产原料是分不开的。同时有些即使属于国家统购原料，也可以考虑划定一定地区一定品种由手工业合作社去直接购买，以调剂不足，也可以补助商业上的不足。如收购生皮在山东有的地区即划定地区让手工业合作社收购杂皮，效果很好，两得其便，既利用了杂皮，也适当减少了规格皮的使用，同时有的原料手工业合作社就地直接购买价格比商业部门经手几乎要低一倍。有些地区好的经验想推行另一个地区，往往借口“实际情况不同”而不采用，究竟“实际情况不同”的是什么？往往缺乏分析，概括一言而蔽之。其实有时可能是我们脑子里想的“思想实际”，不一定是真正的“客观实际”，而“实际情况不同”这一句话有时被用来隐盖了“对某些问题思想不通”“对某些情况钻研不深”的借口。关于原料第二个问题，即不少手工业利用废料生产，这是手工业的特点，应该积极发挥手工业这一特点，以充分发挥利用物资的潜在力量，增加对人民需要的物资供应力量，而贯彻国家增产节约的精神。过去手工业合作社在这一方面有不少的收获，如去年钢铁供应紧张，福建、广东某些地区手工业合作社即组织工人上山挖几十年前埋在地下的一些土炮来生产农具，以支援农业生产。当然有些手工业对利用废料还不够重视。虽然有不少手工业可以利用废料，但很多地方手工业合作社不能够就地直接购买废料，这就大大影响了手工业者利用废料的积极性。因为利用废料生产有的费工，不如利用好料生产省工，有的废料产品价格要低，而废料一转手，就要加价，加了价的废料，又由于费工，在手工业者利用起来往往就会影响收入减少，因而就不想利用。也有的废料外运，当地反而想利用而不可得。建议应该规定全国手工业合作社可以直接收购自用的废料，并且应该允许各地手工业合作社可以互相调剂，既发挥充分利用废料，又可补救手工业原料不足的困难。手工业部门收购用不了的废料，上缴给国家。有的个别属于国家必需统一分配的个别废料如铜，手工业收来可以交给国家不用或不收购。在国家积极建设需要充分发挥利用物资的潜在力量，这个问题需要从速解决，以发挥手工业的特点。关于原料第三个问题，即有关统一分配的原料，在有些地区对不同经济类型之间做到统筹兼顾，但有的地区有统筹而兼顾不够。如在一个地方同等技术条件的地方国营厂或公私合营厂与手工业合作社每人每月分配原料有的有时相差一倍多，悬殊过大，正是“有的做不完”“有的不够做”，这里实质上是涉及到对手工业和对合作社所有制的看法问题。希望存在这个问题的地区能够获得改进，主要是要分配的恰当，要注意到手工业有的今天不生产，明天生活会有问题，有的旺季不多生产，淡季就发生困难，我倒不是要求来一个平均主义分配原料。
    收购价和工缴费偏低
    其次谈谈产品加工、收购、包销问题，为了统一掌握重要物资，稳定市场，保证国家社会主义建设资金积累，手工业有些产品是属于商业部门加工、收购、包销，虽然有些产品有改变选购之说，实行起来也不简单，而且要有过程，目前问题主要有二：一为有的收购价或工缴费过低了，影响社员收入、影响生产，如土纸收购价，某些手工艺品及某些地区棉布的工缴费偏低；二是有些产品，商业部门借口商业系统包销了，其他部门不得过问，而环节过多，也影响了收购价或工缴费低。如全国土纸1953年以来减产，主要即受了压低收购价的影响。1953年以来土纸一般压价达百分之二、三十，最多达50％，有的降低工资来维持生产，有的赔本，有的转业停产，有的合作社亏垮了，甚至于有的产纸县十分之九停了产。虽然1956年对土纸收购价格有了适当调整，因为调整的价格有些地区有些品种并未达到压价前的水平，而几年来社会的一般工资又上升，而目前土纸所用原料价格也上涨了，如何能够推动增产呢？收购价和工缴费，必须能从符合实际出发分配恰当的精神来处理。商业经营环节有的地方多得惊人，如土纸从收到卖有的地区多到六七道环节。说是为国家积累资金，实际上因为流转环节过多，真正获利无几，所以有的干部对环节过多不满地说：“一统，二转，三关，四过手，手手要榨油，真正的油水并不多。”我建议收购包销的产品要采取“产销直线结合”方式，即产地生产单位将产品直接卖给主要销地进货商业单位，包销而属于出口部分产品应该直接销于出口贸易部门，不必经过内销商业部门之手，每年事先作好平衡分配安排挂钩订合同工作，不少收购包销产品如土纸，均有一定销售渠道，某地某种产品主要销区及数量，均有一定基础，如江西瑞金玉扣纸出口一向直运广州，宁都毛边纸一向直走上海，做起来并不费事，也可以选点试办，逐渐推广；因为事先平衡安排了，也不会发生争购，更不影响包销，同时可以大大减少不必要的环节和节省人力物力财力的浪费，并且在不影响国家资金积累和社会销售价的情况下可以适当调整偏低的收购价或工缴费，以保证生产者应得的劳动收入，而进一步发挥他们的生产积极性。
    以上所谈的这两个问题，一方面是涉及对手工业原料安排恰当及充分发挥物资潜在的力量问题，一方面是涉及手工业生产收入在国家、手工业合作社、手工业者之间分配如何恰当问题，正确处理这些问题，可以进一步加强手工业合作社积极发展生产和进一步发挥手工业者建设社会主义的积极性，也是更进一步加强密切党和一些手工业者的关系。同时我要指出手工业合作社也存在不少缺点，主要如小生产者自发倾向和资本主义经营思想。这在去年下半年提出自由市场开放以后，市场供应紧张之际，有的合作社表现特别突出，如偷工减料，粗制滥造，影响质量，有时给商业部门造成一些困难，也有的有时造成原料浪费和损失。商业部门几年来为国家积累资金、组织物资供应、稳定市场，作了很大努力，取得了很大成绩，也有很多宝贵经验，我相信在国家建设前进中，这些问题不难获得合理改进。
    充分利用手工业
    发展手工业
    最后我想谈谈对手工业的看法问题，从党所提出对手工业进行社会主义改造任务以及一再强调手工业的重要性来看，似乎这个问题不存在，根据我在工作中的体会，也还是或多或少存在一些问题。如我们和有些人谈手工业技术改造，就有人说：“现在是要搞自动化的时代，手工业还搞什么技术改造呢？”也有的人说：“世界技术水平天天在飞跃进步，你们还在搞什么手工业技术改造，真是浪费，真是枉费心力。”甚至于有的人干脆说：“手工业早晚得淘汰。”手工业为地方工业组成部分之一，一般对手工业是重视的，但有的地区愿意另拿钱办工厂，而不来帮助扩充当地有现成基础的手工业合作社，以至有时造成生产上安排困难，原料供应困难，产品推销困难，甚至于去挖手工业工人，无形中反映出只有地方国营工业才是地方工业，手工业似乎不算。当然手工业产值比工业、农业要小，大工业和农业在经济上当然起着决定作用，但是手工业不是可有可无，而是必不可少的。手工业行业多，大多就地取材，就地生产，就地供应，而且手工业面广、灵活、易于适应社会需要变化，而且有的生产精致，可以补助大工业的不足。手工业不只是大工业的临时助手，而是长期的助手。从城市到农村，我们从生到死，我们日常生活的衣食住行及文娱，广大农、牧、渔业的生产工具、手工业生产工具，甚至于部分工业所需用件，手工业均起了积极供应作用，有些地区人民生产上生活上日用品，手工业品要占百分之七、八十，很多中小城市，所谓工业主要就是手工业。同时手工业便于安排劳动力，需资少，收效快。目前是要研究如何积极发挥手工业的特点来发展手工业生产，如何合理安排，以发挥手工业为大工业助手的作用。在整个工业化建设过程中，应该研究把手工业如何安排恰当。各地应该充分利用手工业，大力协助手工业，在充分利用发展手工业的基础上来发展地方工业，既有利于劳动力和供产销的安排，又可节省国家财力，而且一部分手工业合作社，到一定时期有条件的需要过渡。至于手工业技术改造，应该根据国家整个生产水平、技术水平、财力和劳动力多需要安排的总精神来研究手工业技术改造的进度和具体做法，机械化应该放慢一些，手工业中也可能有些生产不能机械化。但这绝不意味着手工业就不搞技术改造，不搞机械化。当然手工业技术改造倒是一件复杂工作，它不能完全搬大工业一套和学大工厂搞自动化，而主要首先是在现在设备基础上加以改造，同时要在保持手工业特点的基础上来研究它的技术改造途径。毛主席指示要调动一切积极因素来为建设社会主义而努力。手工业专业人员上千万，兼业人员更多，潜在力量很大，广大手工业者对建设社会主义热情很高，应该积极发挥这一广大积极因素和潜在力量，为建设社会主义而奋斗！
