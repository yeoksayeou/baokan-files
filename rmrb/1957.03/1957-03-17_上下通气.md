    Air Circulation Between Higher and Lower Levels
    Kong Sang
    “Oh, dear friends, though our hearts are as one,
    Distance makes the heart grow fonder.
    Let’s have a heart-to-heart talk,
    How can we know what’s on each other’s minds if we don’t?”
    This is a song sung by Mao Yihan, a famous ballad singer in Hohhot. I would like to use it here to illustrate the feelings of workers and leaders in some enterprises. Some leaders and workers in enterprises all want to improve production and are friends whose "hearts are as one," but they do not understand each other, or do not fully understand what each other is thinking. They want to have a heart-to-heart talk with each other, but they are hampered by a lack of opportunity. Because when the leading cadres are at work, the workers are also at work; when the workers get off work, the leading cadres also get off work. When leading cadres go to the workshop, they see that the workers are very nervous, and besides solving some urgent problems, who has time to talk?
    Maintaining close ties with the masses is the basic method of all revolutionary work. It is a pity for friends to become estranged; the harm is even greater when leading cadres become estranged from the masses. What should be done? The "spare-time office hours" implemented by the Dahua Textile Factory in Xi'an is a good method. Leading cadres take turns holding office hours in their spare time to receive workers, and separately go deep into the workers' dormitories to talk with the workers and their families. This way, problems can be discovered and solved in a timely manner without hindering daily production and work; the workers are satisfied, and the leading cadres are also educated.
    However, "spare-time office hours" is by no means the only way to maintain contact with the masses. The system of regular (one afternoon per week) meetings between the factory director and employee representatives established by the Anhui First Textile and Dyeing Factory is also a method. Although employee representatives take up some production time when they go to the factory director, it will not hinder production if appropriate adjustments are made in labor organization. I remember that last year, when the director of the Wuhan Public-Private Joint Yuhua Cotton Mill talked to our newspaper reporters about leadership experience, he said that Party and government leading cadres should participate as much as possible in meetings related to employee recreational activities, maintain close contact with activists in spare-time activities, and expand the scope of contact between leaders and the masses. These effective methods are all worth promoting. The more methods adopted, the more opportunities there will be for leaders and the masses to meet and talk, and the fewer opportunities there will be for leading cadres to make subjective and bureaucratic mistakes.

    “亲密的友人呀，虽然心心相印，
    日久不见也会疏远。
    让我们来谈谈心吧，
    不谈怎知心里话。”
    这是呼和浩特市著名说唱艺人毛依罕唱的一支歌。我想在这里用它来说明某些企业里工人和领导人员的心情。有些企业里的领导人员和工人，都想搞好生产，是“心心相印”的朋友，然而互相不了解，或不完全了解对方在想些什么。他们彼此想谈谈心，却苦于没有机会。因为领导干部上班的时候，工人也上班；等到工人下了班，领导干部也下了班。领导干部到了车间，看见工人都很紧张，除了解决一些急需解决的问题以外，谁有时间谈心呢？
    密切联系群众，是一切革命工作的基本方法。朋友疏远诚可惜，领导干部和群众疏远，危害则更大。怎么办呢？西安大华纺织厂实行的“业余办公”是一个好办法。领导干部轮流在业余时间办公接待工人，并分别深入工人宿舍，找工人和他们的家属谈心。这样做，既能及时发现问题和解决问题，又不妨碍日常的生产和工作；工人满意，领导干部也受到教育。
    然而，“业余办公”绝不是唯一的联系群众的办法。安徽第一纺织染厂建立厂长定期（每星期一个下午）接见职工代表制度，也是一个办法。职工代表去找厂长时，虽然占用部分生产时间，但是如果在劳动组织方面加以适当调整，也不致妨碍生产。记得去年武汉公私合营裕华纱厂厂长对本报记者谈领导经验时，曾说过党政领导干部要尽可能地参加有关职工文娱活动的会议，密切联系业余活动的积极分子，扩大领导跟群众的接触面。这些行之有效的办法，都值得提倡。采用的办法越多，领导和群众见面谈心的机会也就越多，领导干部犯主观主义、官僚主义错误的机会也就越少。
