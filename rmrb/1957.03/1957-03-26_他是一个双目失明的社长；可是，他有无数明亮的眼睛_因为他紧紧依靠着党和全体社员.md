　　He is a blind president; yet,
　　He has countless bright eyes
　　Because he closely relies on the Party and all members
　　Ding Yuan
	Another spring plowing and planting season has begun.
	The male and female members of the Sixth Agricultural Cooperative of Xinmin Township, Chongming County, Jiangsu Province are busy planting. The president of the cooperative, Chen Qingzhang, is among the members, pointing and measuring with a purple bamboo cane in his hand, seemingly occupied. He is a blind president. How did he become president? And how does he lead an agricultural cooperative of over eight hundred households so well? Before visiting here, these questions were hard to understand.

　  How does the blind president work?
	How does Chen Qingzhang work? Daily, he habitually uses his "bright cane" (a two-foot nine-inch long purple bamboo cane) to guide him, going back and forth in the fields of each production team, checking the quality and standards of cultivation. The cultivation standards discussed in the cooperative's meetings are the basis for his production inspections. For example, if the cooperative determines that the row spacing for planting corn should be three feet wide, he goes to the field while the members are planting corn, measures it with his "bright cane," and then feels it with his hand. If each row spacing is slightly longer than the "bright cane" by one inch, it is considered to meet the cultivation standard. Another example is plowing the land. The members discuss plowing four inches deep. The "bright cane" has a flat bottom. When inserted into the loose soil, the "bright cane" sinks into the loose soil. By feeling it with his hand, he knows whether the quality of the land plowed by that team is good or bad... One day, as he was walking towards the fields of the Third Production Team, he was stopped on the road by a dozen women who were weeding the cotton fields. They wanted to talk to the president.

	"President Chen," the members address him affectionately. One female member said, "We women do the same work as men, so why do we get fewer work points?"

	"We have children who cry, and we need to breastfeed," a mother of three children said to the president, "Why not arrange for us to work in fields closer to home, so it's easier for us to breastfeed and take care of our children?"

	Other female members raised issues about not having enough grass allocated for fuel after joining the cooperative, and other daily life problems. He listened quietly to the women's opinions. These issues were eventually resolved smoothly at a meeting of the cooperative's management committee.

	Consulting with the masses
	He is thus connected to the masses and loved by the members. Therefore, last spring, when the agricultural cooperative expanded from seventy-six households to a high-level cooperative of eight hundred and twelve households, he was again elected as president by everyone.

	Shortly after the establishment of the high-level cooperative, the county organized members to reclaim the nearby newly accreted sandbar – Juxing Sandbar. All of the cooperative's male labor force went to Juxing Sandbar to build embankments. At that time, it was the wheat harvest season, and it was the first time to harvest such a large area of wheat. What should be done? He called a meeting of the members to mobilize everyone to discuss and arrange for forces to be put into the harvest. As a result, all of the semi-labor force and female labor force remaining in the cooperative were mobilized and timely harvested all of the cooperative's wheat, completing the summer harvest and summer planting. Last autumn, there was no fertilizer. Seeing that autumn planting could not be done in time, he first studied with the cooperative management committee and then relied on all forty Party members in the cooperative to take the lead in digging thirteen ditches of raw mud, solving the autumn planting fertilizer problem.

	Chen Qingzhang believes in the masses and often visits members' homes. When encountering difficulties, he brings them to the masses for discussion, which has become an important method for him to lead the agricultural cooperative. All day long, he is active among the members of the cooperative, walking on the field paths of the cooperative. He rarely sits in the office. He himself said, "My eyes are blind, but my heart is beating, my mind can think, and my ears can hear. Visiting members' homes and listening to their opinions gives me a clear idea of how to work." Indeed, what this blind president said is the mass line he has experienced in his actual work. As the saying goes, "Keep your eyes on all directions and your ears open to all sides," which is true.

	Adhering to diligence and thrift in running the cooperative
	In the year since Chen Qingzhang led the cooperative, he has consistently implemented the principle of diligence and thrift in running the cooperative.

	When the high-level cooperative was first established, some cooperative cadres thought that a large cooperative should look like a large cooperative, and they asked to buy this and add that one after another. Some people said behind their backs that President Chen did not look like the president of a "large cooperative." The deputy business committee member and the breeder proposed to build three livestock farms and seven new pigsties; the custodian said that the cooperative was larger, and there would be more things to store in the future, so they wanted to build two large warehouses; the technology extension officer wanted to buy eight three-pronged cultivators and eight double-furrow plows; the Youth League branch secretary said that the youth needed to hold meetings and study, so they needed to make five tables and twenty benches, and also buy gasoline lamps; and some people proposed to build an office, buy a radio, and a writing desk...

	Chen Qingzhang disagreed with doing so. He believed that spending every penny should be considered for the members, and non-productive expenses must be reduced, and there should be no ostentation. He thought that just telling everyone big principles would not work. So he proposed to convene a meeting of cadres above the rank of team leader to specifically discuss how to run the cooperative. At the meeting, he asked the accountant to announce the cooperative's income and expenditure accounts after running the cooperative, and then calculated the items that everyone had originally proposed to buy or do one by one. With this calculation, some cadres stuck out their tongues. Everyone agreed with his opinion: the livestock farms and pigsties would not be built, the pigs would be distributed to the members' homes to raise, and the old pigsties in each household could be used...

	Caring about the lives of the members
	On September 24th last year, dark clouds covered the sky, and a sudden torrential rain fell. Chen Qingzhang returned home from a meeting in the township in the rain and had just picked up his bowl to eat. A member ran over to report that the houses of several members of the Fourth, Ninth, and Tenth Production Teams had been blown down by the wind. Upon hearing this news, he was more worried than if his own house had been blown down. He immediately put down his rice bowl, put on a sackcloth, barefoot, and took his "bright cane" to rush to the disaster site five or six miles away from home in the heavy rain. Thirty-eight houses had been blown down by a tornado, and seventeen members were trapped in the houses. He immediately mobilized the surrounding masses to send the seriously injured to the hospital, asked doctors to treat the lightly injured, and at the same time, he worked with the township and cooperative cadres to solve the living difficulties of the disaster-stricken households.

	There are several old, weak, and disabled members in the cooperative who are enjoying the "Five Guarantees." He often goes to these members' homes to ask about their well-being and help them solve some difficulties in their lives. If someone in the cooperative is sick, as long as he knows about it, he will always take time out of his busy schedule to visit. Last spring, member Qian Zhiwen had a "stomach ache." When he found out about it, he went to the joint clinic to invite a doctor. The diagnosis was appendicitis, and if not treated promptly, his life would be in danger. At the same time that Qian Zhiwen had his appendicitis surgery, Qian's wife was about to give birth. He busily helped to invite a midwife, so that the child was born safely, and both the adult and the child were healthy. Who wouldn't be moved by these things!

　　A strong Communist Party member
	Chen Qingzhang's eyes went blind in the summer of his twenty-fourth year. It was when he was carrying grain for the landlord that mud and sand got into his eyes, causing eye disease. He had no money for treatment and finally went blind. Since he was a child, he helped his father pull a small cart, picked up manure, and at the age of ten, he weeded and cut firewood for the landlord... He suffered all kinds of exploitation and torture in the old society.

	Real living began after liberation. Due to his noble thoughts and behavior, the local masses composed a jingle for him:

	Blind Chen Qingzhang,
	Is brighter than the eyes;
	Endures hardship and works hard for the members,
	Is enthusiastic in handling affairs!

	"You can't see, why do you still want to work?" Whenever people ask him this, he always answers, "I am a Communist Party member, and that is why I want to work."

	It's true that everyone in the Sixth Agricultural Cooperative of Xinmin Township, whether young or old, praises him as a good president. He often kicks his toes on stones on the road while going out to work, drawing blood; his forehead often bumps against walls and pillars, protruding large bumps... He has never complained about these things. He is indeed a strong Communist Party member.

　　他是一个双目失明的社长；可是，
　　他有无数明亮的眼睛
　　因为他紧紧依靠着党和全体社员
　　丁远
    又一个春耕春种季节开始了。
    江苏省崇明县新民乡第六农业社的男女社员们紧张地在播种。社长陈庆章挤在社员们中间，拿在手里的那根紫色竹竿一忽儿指指点点，一忽儿又丈丈量量，不知在干什么。这是一位双目失明的社长，他怎样成为社长的？他又怎样把一个八百多户的农业社领导得那样好？这些问题，在我没有来到这里访问之前，是很难理解的。
　  瞎社长怎样进行工作
    陈庆章怎样进行工作的呢？日常他习惯地拿着那根指路的“明杖”（一根二尺九寸长的紫色竹竿），往来在各个生产队的田间，检查耕作质量和耕作标准。社里开会讨论的耕作标准，就是他检查生产的依据。像社里确定播种玉米的行距是三尺宽，他乘社员正在播种玉米的时候，就下田用“明杖”一量，再用手一摸，每个行距比“明杖”稍长一寸，就算符合了耕作标准，又如翻耕土地，社员们讨论翻耕四寸深，“明杖”是平底的，它在翻松的土地上一插，“明杖”就陷进了松土，用手一摸，他就知道那个队翻耕的土地质量好或者不好……。一天，他正向第三生产队的田间走去，在路上被正在拔棉花地里的草的十来个妇女叫住了。她们要和社长谈谈。
    “陈社长”，社员们都这样亲切地称呼他，一个女社员说：“我们妇女和男人同样做一种生活，工分为啥比他们少呢？”
    “我们有小孩吵，给孩子喂奶，”三个孩子的母亲对社长说：“为啥不照顾给近一点的田里做活，使我们喂奶和照管孩子方便些呢？”
    还有的女社员提出了入社后分到的草不够烧等等日常生活问题。他静静地听取了女社员的意见。这些问题终于在一次社务管理委员会议上顺利地解决了。
    和群众商量
    他就是这样联系群众和被社员们所爱戴着，所以在去年春天，农业社由七十六户扩大为八百十二户的高级社的时候，他又被大家选为社长。
    高级社建立不久，县里组织社员去围垦附近的新涨沙——聚星沙。社里的男劳动力全部上聚星沙挑圩岸去了。当时正是麦收的季节，收割大面积的麦子又是第一次，怎么办呢？他就召开社员会议，发动大家讨论，安排力量投入收割运动。结果留在社里的半劳动力和妇女劳动力全部动员起来，及时收割了全社的麦子，完成了夏收夏种。去年秋种时没有肥料，眼看不能及时秋种，他先和社管委会研究后，依靠全社四十个党员，带头挖掘了十三条泯沟的生泥，解决了秋种肥料问题。
    陈庆章相信群众，常去社员家串门访问，遇到困难，就摆到群众中去商量，已经成了他领导农业社的一项重要方法。一天到晚，他都出没在社员群众中，行走在社里的田头小道；他很少坐在办公室里。他自己说：“我眼睛是看不见了，但我的心是在跳动的，我的头脑能想事情，我的耳朵能听，到社员家去串门访问，听听社员们的意见，我工作起来心中就有数了。”的确，这位瞎社长说的话，是他在实际工作中体会到的群众路线。俗语说“眼见四方，耳听八方”，真是一点也不假。
    坚持勤俭办社
    陈庆章在领导合作社一年来，一直坚持贯彻了勤俭办社的方针。
    当高级社一搞起来，有些社干部却认为：大社要像个大社的样子，纷纷地要求买这添那，有些人在背后说陈社长不像“大社”的社长。副业委员和饲养员提出要砌三个畜牧场和七个新猪圈；保管员说社大了，将来收的东西多，要砌两间大仓库；技术推广员要买八只三齿中耕机、八张双铧犁；青年团支部书记说，青年要开会和学习，要做五张桌子、二十条凳子，还要买汽油灯；还有人提出要砌办公室，买收音机、写字台……。
    陈庆章不同意这样做。他认为用一分钱也要为社员着想，必须减少非生产开支，不要闹排场。他想，光和大家讲大道理是不行的。于是提议召开了一个队长以上的干部会议，专门讨论如何办社？他在会上叫会计公布了办社后的收支账，再把大家原先提出来要买要办的这些东西逐项算账。这一算，有些干部就伸舌头了，大家都同意了他的意见，畜牧场、猪圈不砌了，猪分到各社员家去养，可以利用各家的旧猪圈房……。
    关心社员的生活
    去年9月24日这一天，乌云密布，突然下了一场暴雨。陈庆章从乡里开会后冒雨到家，刚端上碗吃饭。一个社员跑来报告，第四、九、十生产队的好多家社员的房子被风刮倒了。他听到这消息，比刮了自己的房屋还着急，立即放下饭碗，披上麻袋赤着脚，拿起那根“明杖”冒着大雨，赶往离家五、六里路的受灾现场。这是被龙卷风吹倒了三十八间房屋，有十七个社员被压在屋里。他立即动员周围群众，把重伤的人送医院，轻伤的人请医生来治疗，同时他又和乡、社干部共同研究，解决了受灾户的生活困难。
    社里有好几个老弱残废社员是享受“五保”的，他经常到这些社员家里去问长问短，帮助他们解决一些生活上的困难。社里如果有人生病，只要被他知道，他总要在百忙里抽出时间去探问。去年春天，社员钱志文“肚子痛”。这事被他知道了，他就摸到联合诊所请来了医生，诊断结果是阑尾炎，不加紧治疗就会断送生命，就在钱志文阑尾炎开刀的同时，钱的妻子要生小孩了，他又忙碌地帮着请来接生员，使孩子平安地生下，大人小孩都很健康。提起这些事谁能不感动啊！
　　一个坚强的共产党员
    陈庆章的眼睛是在他二十四岁的那年夏天瞎掉的。是替地主家搬运粮食的时候，泥沙塞入，害了眼病，无钱医治，终于瞎了。他从小就帮父亲纤小车，拾粪，十岁时就替地主家拔草、割柴……，受尽了旧社会的剥削和折磨。
    真正生活的日子是从解放以后开始的。由于他崇高的思想和行为，当地群众为他编了一个顺口溜：
    瞎子陈庆章，
    赛过眼睛亮；
    吃苦耐劳为社员，
    办起事来热心肠！
    “你眼睛看不见了，为什么还要工作呢？”每当人们这样问他的时候，他总是这样回答：“我是共产党员，这就是我要工作的原因。”
    一点不假，新民乡第六农业社里不论年青人或是老年人，都称赞他是个好社长。他经常为了外出工作，在路上把脚趾头踢在石块上，流出了鲜血；他的额头常常碰在墙壁上、柱子上，凸出了一个个的大疙瘩；……。这些他都没有诉过苦，他确实是个坚强的共产党员。
