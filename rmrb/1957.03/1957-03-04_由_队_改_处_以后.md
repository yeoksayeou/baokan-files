    After the Change from "Team" to "Department"
    The predecessor of the Minjiang Water Transportation Department was a timber rafting team under the Western Sichuan Forestry Industrial Bureau. It was only in July of last year that it was placed under the direct leadership of the Sichuan Forestry Industrial Administration and renamed the Minjiang Water Transportation Department. With the change of the unit's name, the signs on the doors of the original offices were changed from ×× Section to ×× Division and ×× Section; the original team leaders, instructors, and section chiefs were promoted to directors, division chiefs, and section chiefs. The original unit of 102 people suddenly increased to 400 people. There were thirteen divisions alone (not counting the Party Committee, the Communist Youth League Committee, and the Rationalization Proposal Office). The largest supply division, responsible only for the supply of staple and non-staple foods and tools for 1,500 people, had fifty people; a job that could have been done by one purchasing agent was assigned to three people.
    Due to the excessive increase of cadres and the desire to put on a good front, there was a surplus of staff everywhere. For example, the Minjiang Water Transportation Department's resident timber yard in Chengdu had more than 100 cadres, more than the number of workers. On average, 30 people had nothing to do every day. As for the headquarters of the Minjiang Water Transportation Department, there were even more people with nothing to do. In every office, you could see people sitting by the brazier reading newspapers and novels, or chatting or cooking things to eat. Of the 39 people in the supply division, only 10 were actually working every day. The headquarters of the Minjiang Water Transportation Department had 118 people, but only about 20 people were actually working; among the more than 400 cadres in the entire department, 20% had no work at all.
    The overlapping of institutions and the chaotic work of the Minjiang Water Transportation Department are also very prominent. Under the department, there are divisions, under the divisions there are sections, under the sections there are detachments, and one detachment leads 70 to 120 people. When an order comes from above, it is passed down layer by layer, resulting in mutual orders, mutual reliance, and mutual misunderstanding. When making summaries and copying reports, everyone asks each other, and no one can explain clearly. The supply division does not know what the production workshop is lacking, and makes blind purchases; materials urgently needed for production are not supplied in time, while a large amount of materials not needed for production are stockpiled. This kind of layered, order-issuing working method often backfires, and even a small matter often brings unnecessary trouble. Once, Su Beiyou from the infrastructure division was sent to buy refined oil, but he brought back 60 jin of vinegar, which could not be eaten and could not be disposed of. The supply division has a cadre in charge of financial accounting, and the finance division also has one. The two units are only separated by a wall, but they do the same work. What is most surprising is that the cadre division does not know how many cadres there are in the organization. The transfer of cadres is not based on work needs, but whoever likes to give opinions to the leaders is considered "naughty, backward elements," and they are transferred. When the head of the cadre division, Liu Xiangde, talks to cadres, he often says, "There are not many like you backward elements, and it doesn't matter if you're gone." Or "With you, the water transportation department is doomed..." Therefore, when allocating work, some cadres either leave in a huff after arguing, or argue so much that the work cannot be assigned.
    In short, the problems of the Minjiang Water Transportation Department are numerous and complex, and urgently need to be studied and resolved by relevant units.

### 由“队”改“处”以后

    由“队”改“处”以后
    岷江水运处的前身是川西森林工业局所属的一个木材流送队，去年7月才划归四川森林工业管理局直接领导，改名为岷江水运处。随着单位名称的改变，原来各办公室门上的牌子由××股换成××科和××段；原来的工队长、指导员和股长就一跃而为主任、科长和段长。原来一个一百零二人的单位一下子增加到四百人了。光科室就有十三个（党委、团委和合理化建议办公室还不算）。最大的一个供应科仅仅负责一千五百人的主副食品和工器具的供应工作，就有五十个人；本来一个采购员就可以做的工作，却派了三个人去做。
    由于过多的增加干部、装门面，结果到处人浮于事。如岷江水运处驻成都贮木场的干部就有一百多人，比工人都多，每天平均有三十个人没有事做。至于岷江水运处本部，没有事情可做的就更多了。每个办公室，都可以看到有的人坐在火盆边看报、看小说，有的在聊天或者烧东西吃。供应科三十九个人，每天真正工作的只有十个人。岷江水运处本部有一百一十八人，实际做工作的也不过二十多人；全处四百多名干部中，还有20％的人根本没有工作。
    岷江水运处的机构重叠，工作混乱也是很突出的。处下面设有科、科下面有工段、工段下面又有分队、一个分队下面领导七十到一百二十个人。上面来一道命令，就层层照转，结果互相命令、互相依靠，又互不了解。做总结抄表报，一个问一个，谁也说不清。供应科不知道生产车间缺什么东西，盲目采购；生产上急需的材料又供应不及时，而生产上不需要的材料大批积压。这种层次重叠、发号施令的工作方法，往往事与愿违，那怕一件小事，也常常带来不必要的麻烦。有一次，派基建科苏倍友买清油，结果提回来六十斤醋，吃又吃不完，又没办法处理。供应科有一个专管财务会计工作的干部，财务科也有一个，两个单位只隔了一道墙，却做的是一样的工作。最使人惊奇的是干部科不知道机关有多少干部。调动干部不是根据工作需要，而是谁爱给领导人提意见，就认为谁“调皮捣蛋、落后分子”，就给他调动工作。干部科科长刘祥德和干部谈话的时候，经常说“落后分子，有你不多，没你不少。”或是“有了你水运处就倒霉了……”所以分配工作的时候有些干部不是吵架之后扬长而去，就是吵得分配不了工作。
    总之，岷江水运处的问题既多而又复杂，急需有关单位研究解决。
