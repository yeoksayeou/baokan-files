    Motherland Scenery
    The Heavenly Lake on the Tianshan Mountains, along the base of the perpetually snow-capped Bogda Peak. Surrounded by mountains and towering ancient pines and cypresses, the lake water is green and transparent. Ancient legends say that Heavenly Lake was the Jade Pool of the Queen Mother of the West, and today it has become a resort for people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Photo by Zhou Xiao

    祖国风光
    天山上的天池，在长年积雪的博格达山峰下沿。四周群山围抱，苍松古树高插云霄，池水碧绿透明。古代传说天池是王母的瑶池，今日成了新疆各族人民的游览胜地。　　　　　　　　　　周虓摄
