Several Suggestions on the Work of the CPPCC
Joint Speech by Yu Zejiu, Xu Yiguan, Mei Yifan, Wu Minggang, Liu Zhonghe, and Jia Dongming

　　We are non-voting delegates from Shandong. We all feel particularly honored to be able to attend the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC. Before and during the meeting, we listened to the reports of Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and other leaders, which clarified our thinking, improved our understanding, and strengthened our confidence and encouraged us to expand and consolidate the people's democratic united front in the future. We wholeheartedly support these reports and are willing to make unremitting efforts to implement the spirit and instructions in these reports.

　　1956 was a year of rapid development for China's socialist undertakings. Over the past year, the local CPPCCs in Shandong Province and cities have made certain achievements and gained some experience in organizing the industrial and commercial circles and social democrats to study and implement the Party's policies, and in uniting people from all walks of life to mobilize all forces that can be mobilized. For example, some of the short-term training courses organized for the industrial and commercial circles have completed three sessions, with more than 16,300 graduates. Through study, they have not only further transformed their thinking, but also have many vivid and concrete practical manifestations in their work. Many people have won praise from relevant counterpart companies and workers after graduation, basically achieving the initial requirement of "destroying capitalism and establishing socialism." For example, more than 4,200 social figures were contacted, and they were organized to study current affairs policies through social work groups, and those with financial difficulties were given subsidies. Many people have recognized the mainstream of social development and deeply appreciate the care of the Party and the government for them, expressing that they will break down doubts, approach the people, and do more for the people within their capabilities in the future. Of course, due to our lack of hard work and low policy level, there are still many shortcomings in our work, which need to be greatly improved in the future. In order to further expand and consolidate the people's democratic united front, we put forward the following three points for discussion:

　　The CPPCC Charter should add new tasks

　　I. The tasks of the CPPCC: In the past two years, the local CPPCCs have consulted and carried out the local people's democratic united front work in accordance with the seven guidelines of the CPPCC Charter and other relevant regulations, and have achieved certain results. However, with the basic completion of the three major socialist transformations in China, the domestic class relations have undergone fundamental changes, especially since the Party put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" last year. We believe that the people's democratic united front work has entered a new historical period. Therefore, we feel that the CPPCC Charter should add new tasks in accordance with the new situation. The Party's policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" seems necessary to be written into the CPPCC Charter. At the same time, some municipal and county CPPCCs should be appropriately added to better mobilize social forces and serve the socialist construction of the motherland.

　　More specific provisions on the content of consultation

　　II. The content of political consultation: In accordance with the spirit of the CPPCC Charter, the local CPPCCs have generally consulted and discussed major issues related to national political life and the people's democratic united front work, and have played a certain role in communicating policy ideas, mobilizing social forces, and assisting state organs in publicizing and implementing policies and decrees. However, due to the fact that it is only a principle regulation, some difficulties have also arisen in the work. Therefore, we hope that the National Committee will specify the content of consultation more concretely in accordance with the actual situation of the local CPPCCs in the past few years. For example, in addition to the policies, laws, and draft regulations submitted by the Central Committee for discussion, local regulations, major measures, instructions, etc., that involve the common issues of several classes should be included in the content of consultation. This does not mean that any issue cannot be handled without being submitted to the CPPCC for consultation, but such consultation on major issues is an important method for the government to widely listen to opinions from all parties and for the CPPCC to assist the government in implementing policies and decrees. Therefore, it is beneficial to specify it more concretely.

　　The National Committee and local committees are not suitable to be changed to a leadership relationship

　　III. The relationship between the CPPCC National Committee and the provincial and municipal local CPPCCs: Some comrades have proposed that changing the relationship between the CPPCC National Committee and the provincial and municipal local CPPCCs to a leadership relationship would be more conducive to carrying out the united front work. However, we disagree with this opinion. The reason is that strengthening the Party committee's guidance to the local CPPCCs is the key to doing a good job in the CPPCC. More than 80% of the problems we encounter in our actual work are local and need to be solved by the local Party and government departments. At the same time, the situation of the united front work varies greatly from region to region. Therefore, in the current situation of insufficient experience, it seems unnecessary to change it to a leadership relationship. This will actually reduce the responsibility of the local Party committees and may lead to a phenomenon of relaxing leadership over the local CPPCCs.

　　In the past, the guidance of the National Committee to the local CPPCCs has played a considerable role in carrying out the CPPCC work. In order to do a better job in the local CPPCC work in the future, we hope that the National Committee will frequently issue instructions, and it is best to inspect the work of the local CPPCCs once a year separately, and hold a local work conference once a year to exchange experiences and promote work.

　　If there is anything inappropriate in the above three points, please correct us. (Attached picture)

　　关于政协工作的几点建议
　　于泽九、徐一贯、梅贻璠、吴鸣岗、刘中和、贾东明的联合发言
    我们是来自山东的列席人员，这次能够列席政协全国委员会二届三次会议都感觉分外荣幸。在会议前和会议中听了毛主席、周总理和其他首长的报告，澄清了思想，提高了认识，对今后扩大和巩固人民民主统一战线工作坚定了信心获得了鼓舞。我们竭诚拥护这些报告，并愿为贯彻这些报告中的精神和指示而努力不懈。
    1956年是我国社会主义各项事业飞跃发展的一年。一年来，山东省、市地方政协不论在组织工商界和社会民主人士学习，贯彻党的方针、政策方面，不论在团结各阶层人士调动社会一切可以调动的力量方面，都作出了一定成绩，摸出了一些经验。诸如组织工商界学习的短期讲习班有的已经办完了三期，已经结业的学员有16，300余名。通过学习，不仅在思想上获得了进一步的改造，而且在工作中也有很多生动具体的实际表现，有很多人结业以后博得了有关归口公司和职工群众的好评，基本上达到了“破资本主义，立社会主义”的初步要求。诸如联系社会人士共4，200余名，通过社会工作组组织他们学习时事政策，并对生活有困难的曾加以补助。不少人认识了社会发展的主流，并深切感激党和政府对他们的关怀，表示今后要打破疑虑，靠拢人民，在力所能及的范围内多为人民服务。当然由于我们作风不艰苦，政策水平不高，工作中还存在着很多的缺点，有待今后大力改进。为了进一步扩大与巩固人民民主统一战线，我们提出以下三点意见来商榷：
    政协章程中应增加新任务的规定
    一、政协的任务：两年来，地方政协根据政协章程七项准则和其他有关规定，协商和进行了地方的人民民主统一战线工作。并取得了一定成绩。但随着我国三大社会主义改造的基本完成，国内阶级关系已经发生了根本变化，特别是自从去年党提了“长期共存，互相监督”的方针之后，我们认为人民民主统一战线工作，已经进入一个新的历史时期。因此，我们觉得政协章程应根据新的形势，增加新的任务，党的“长期共存，互相监督”方针，似有必要写在政协章程中。同时，应适当增设一些市、县政协，以更好的调动社会力量，为祖国的社会主义建设服务。
        更具体地规定协商内容
    二、政治协商的内容：地方政协根据政协章程规定的精神，对有关国家政治生活和人民民主统一战线工作中的重大问题，一般都进行了协商讨论，在沟通政策思想、调动社会力量、协助国家机关宣传贯彻政策法令等方面，起了一定作用。但也由于只是一个原则规定，在工作中也产生了一些困难。因此，我们希望，全国委员会根据几年来地方政协的实际情况，对协商的内容规定的较具体些，如：除中央交议的政策、法令、条例草案之外，地方上的单行法、重大措施、指示等，凡涉及到几个阶级共同的问题，例入协商的内容，这样作不等于任何问题，不拿到政协协商就不能办，但这种重大问题的协商，是政府广泛的听取各方面的意见和政协协助政府贯彻政策法令的一种重要方法，因此，规定的具体些有好处。
        全国委员会和地方委员会
          不适宜改为领导关系
    三、政协全国委员会和省、市地方政协的关系：有些同志提出政协全国委员会和省、市地方政协的关系改为领导关系对开展统一战线工作更为有利，我们却不同意这个意见。理由是：党委加强对地方政协的指导是作好政协工作的关键，我们在实际工作中所遇到的问题，80％以上都是地方性的，都是要当地党政部门加以解决的。同时，统一战线的工作情况，各地区之间有很大的差异，因此，在当前经验不足情况下，改为领导关系似不必要，这样实际也会减轻了地方党委的责任，很可能产生对地方政协放松领导的现象。
    过去全国委员会对地方政协的指导，对开展政协工作，已经起了相当作用。今后为了把地方政协工作做的更好些，我们希望全国委员会经常发些指示，最好每年单独视察一次地方政协工作，每年召开一次地方工作会议，以交流经验，推动工作。
    以上三点意见，有不当之处，希予指正。（附图片）
