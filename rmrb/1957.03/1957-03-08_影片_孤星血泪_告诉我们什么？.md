Those who have read Dickens' novels will feel a heart-stirring power from his works. This is not accidental. When the great Dickens appeared on the British literary scene in the 19th century like a comet, it was precisely the stage when British industrial capital was moving from prosperity to its zenith. The bourgeois rule transformed the relationship between people into a purely monetary exchange, and the rapid class division formed a sharp contrast between the "upper class" (bourgeoisie) and the "lower class" (the vast proletariat). The saying "The rich own fields connecting one after another, while the poor don't even have a place to stand" applies equally to feudal landlord society and capitalist society. At this time, the pain of one's background, the lament for national affairs, and the fervent sympathy for the plight of the poor, made Dickens, who had suffered hardships in his youth, project a sharp pen into the dark corners from the very beginning. His novels exposed the ugly faces of the ruling class and expressed lofty feelings for the kind people who were groaning in the darkness. For example, his novel "Great Expectations," written in the first person during the final stage of his creative life (1861), expressed such thoughts. The film "Great Expectations" is adapted from this novel.

In this novel, the author focuses on exposing an important component of the principle of conduct in capitalist society: the principle of climbing up. The story revolves around Pip, a character who climbs up. Pip was originally a poor orphan raised by his brother-in-law. Because he fell in love with a young lady from an upper-class family, he also dreamed of becoming an upper-class person. Once his "great expectations" were realized, and he climbed to the status of an upper-class person, he held a contemptuous attitude towards his brother-in-law who had raised him, and even felt ashamed to be associated with him. Finally, he discovered that he had climbed to the upper class by relying on the money of an escaped convict. What a cold and cruel reality the author portrays here! Under the capitalist system, to climb up, one has to rely on the blood and sweat of others and dirty money; to climb up, one has to be shameless and ungrateful, fawn on the rich upper class, and abandon the poor relatives and friends who once shared joys and sorrows. The author originally intended for Pip to remain alone for life. However, when proofreading, the author listened to the encouragement of his friend Bulwer-Lytton (also a writer) and changed the story to a happy ending, so that Pip and his beloved Estella finally became husband and wife. From this, as well as from the development of Pip's character, we can see the ideological limitations of the great writer Dickens. He believed that good would eventually triumph over evil, and that society could be reformed by human, even bourgeois, kindness. Therefore, Pip's character is both despicable and hateful, and quite kind in the author's writing. In fact, such a role is just a corrupted soul. Some of the prominent features of this snobbish character in the original work were not conveyed in the film, and coupled with the film's use of the name "Great Expectations," some viewers were even more confused about what the theme was.

The image of Miss Havisham, the representative of the "upper class" in Dickens' writing, is very successfully shaped. She is sinister, vicious, selfish, and narrow-minded. After being played with by a man of the same class, she is willing to spend her bleak life in a dark room without sunlight, while using an innocent girl to take revenge on all men, and eventually turns into ashes in a fire. The Miss Havisham in the film is also such a person. However, when portraying Joe Gargery, Pip's brother-in-law—a blacksmith—and his wife, Biddy, two kind-hearted characters belonging to the lower class, the film deleted some moving plots about them, thus diluting their due brilliance.

The film does not clearly explain the relationship between two quite important characters. Pip's "benefactor," the convict Abel Magwitch, was originally a penniless poor man who lived a life of wandering, begging, doing odd jobs, stealing, and even repeatedly going to prison. Another convict with a scar on his left face, named Compeyson, was an unprincipled, wealthy, and powerful upper-class person, who was also the man who played with Miss Havisham. Under the protection of the court, he shifted the crimes he committed onto Abel Magwitch, causing Abel Magwitch to be sentenced to a severe punishment, and from then on, the two became enemies. After Abel Magwitch was exiled to Australia, he made a fortune. Because he had been bullied by the "upper class" all his life, he dreamed of cultivating Pip into an upper-class person, in order to vent his lifelong hatred. The former (Abel Magwitch) can be classified into Pip's category, and the latter (Compeyson) can be classified into Miss Havisham's category. Both of them are of great help in explaining the theme of the story. However, the film's explanation of their backgrounds and the relationship between them is relatively vague. Therefore, some things have to be guessed by the audience themselves.

Although this film has some differences from the original work, it has its own unique features in artistic treatment, and it also expresses the basic spirit of the original work, so that we can see the relationship between people in capitalist society from it, so it is still worth watching.

    影片“孤星血泪”告诉我们什么？
    海观
    读过狄更斯的小说的人，都会从他的作品里感受到一种使人回肠荡气的力量。这不是偶然的。伟大的狄更斯像彗星一样出现在十九世纪英国文坛的时候，正是英国工业资本从欣欣向荣走向如日中天的阶段。资产阶级统治把人与人间的关系变成了纯粹金钱买卖的关系，而急剧的阶级分化又形成了“上等人”（资产阶级）与“下等人”（广大无产者）之间的尖锐的对照。“富者田连阡陌，贫者无立锥之地”，应用在封建地主时代的这句话同样可以应用在资本主义社会。这时候，身世的伤痛，国事的感怀，以及同情穷苦人遭遇的赤胆热肠，使得年轻时代饱经忧患的狄更斯一开始就把一支锋利无比的笔投射到黑暗的角落去。他的小说揭穿了统治阶级的丑恶的嘴脸，对于在黑暗中呻吟的善良的人们寄托了崇高的感情。例如他在创作生活的最后阶段（1861）用第一人称写成的小说“伟大的期望”，就表达了这样的思想。电影“孤星血泪”就是根据这一部小说改编的。
    在这部小说里，作者集中地揭露了资本主义社会处世原则中一个重要的组成部分：往上爬的原则。故事就是环绕着匹普这个往上爬的人物而展开的。匹普原是由他的姐夫抚养大的一个贫苦的孤儿。因为爱上了一位上等人家的小姐，他也梦想做个上等人。一旦实现了他的“伟大的期望”，爬到上等人的地位以后，对于把他抚养成人的姐夫，他就抱着鄙视的态度，甚至羞与为伍了。最后他才发现原来他是靠着一个逃犯的金钱才爬到上等人的地位的。作者在这里刻划出一个何等冷酷的真实！在资本主义制度下面，要往上爬，就得倚靠他人的血汗和肮脏不过的金钱；要往上爬，就得寡廉鲜耻和忘恩负义，对有钱的上等人奴颜婢膝而把昔日同甘苦共患难的穷亲友抛在一边。作者原是把匹普这个人判定为孤独终身的。但在校对清样的时候，作者听从了友人布尔威·李顿（也是作家）的怂恿，把这个故事改成了大团圆的结局，使匹普和他恋爱的艾司得拉终成了眷属。从这里以及从匹普这个人物的发展上，可以看出伟大作家狄更斯的思想局限性。他相信善良终会战胜邪恶，相信社会可以凭着人类甚至资产阶级的善心而得到改革。因此匹普这个人物在作者笔下既是那样可鄙可憎，又是相当善良的。其实这样的角色只不过是个被腐蚀了的灵魂罢了。原作中这个势利人物的一些凸出的地方，在影片里没有传达出来，再加上影片采用了“孤星血泪”这个名字，一部分观众就更不明白主题是什么了。
    狄更斯笔下的代表“上等人”的海未夏姆小姐这个形象是塑造得很成功的。她，阴险、狠毒、自私、狭隘，受了同阶级男人玩弄以后，甘愿在不见阳光的暗室里度过凄凉的一生，同时却利用一个无辜的少女把报复加在一切男人的身上，结果自己在一场大火里化为灰烬。影片中的海未夏姆也正是这样一种人。但是在表现匹普的姐夫——铁匠乔·卡吉莱和他的后妻比弟这两个属于下等人之列的善良的人物的时候，影片却删去了关于他们的一些动人的情节，因而冲淡了他们应有的光彩。
    影片对两个相当重要的人物的关系没有作出清楚的交代。匹普的“恩人”，逃犯之一阿布尔，原是个一贫如洗的苦人，长年过着流浪、乞讨、做短活、偷窃、甚至循环往复的监狱的生活。另一个左脸上有刀疤的逃犯，叫做康帕森，是个无恶不作、有钱有势的上等人，也就是玩弄海未夏姆小姐的人。在法庭的庇护之下，他把自己所犯的罪恶转嫁在阿布尔身上，使得阿布尔被判了重刑，从此两个人结下了仇恨。阿布尔被流放到澳洲去以后发了财，由于自己一生受到“上等人”的欺侮，因此梦想把匹普培养成为上等人，借以宣泄他的平生之恨。这两个人，前者（阿布尔）可以归入匹普一类，后者（康帕森）可以归入海未夏姆一类。他们两人对于说明这个故事的主题有很大的帮助。但影片对他们的身世和相互间的关系的交代却比较含糊。因此有些事情也就不得不由观众自己去猜测了。
    这部电影虽然跟原著有着一些出入，但是在艺术处理上，它是有着独到之处的，而且它也还表现了原著的基本精神，使我们可以从中看出资本主义社会中人与人间的关系，因此还是值得一看的。
