Xinhua News Agency, March 1st:

    In order to develop livestock, especially the pig-raising industry, the State Council has decided to reduce slaughter tax rates and no longer levy business tax on livestock meat. Based on this, the Ministry of Finance issued a notice stipulating:

    1. The tax rate for slaughtering seven types of livestock, including pigs, sheep, and cattle, shall be uniformly 8%. Slaughter tax having already been paid, no business tax or any slaughter tax surcharges shall be levied, regardless of whether it is wholesale, retail, self-consumption, or shared consumption.

    2. The taxable price for slaughter tax is stipulated as follows: Regardless of self-consumption, sale, wholesale, retail, domestic sale, export, allocation, processing, price level, or target of sale, it shall be levied according to the local state-owned company or supply and marketing cooperative's retail listed price; if there is no retail listed price, it shall be levied according to the local market retail price.

    3. For livestock raised, slaughtered, and consumed by farmers themselves, except for appropriate tax exemptions granted by the People's Committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government during the New Year and festivals, no tax exemptions shall be granted at other times.

    4. The slaughter tax calculation standard should be based on the actual weight of the livestock meat when slaughtering, including the folded meat weight of the livestock's head, hooves, and offal. If it is indeed difficult to calculate based on actual weight in remote areas, it can still be calculated based on standard weight, but the determination of standard weight must strive to be realistic and avoid being too high or too low.

    The above provisions shall be implemented from March 1st.

    财政部发布通知
    降低屠宰税免征牲肉营业税
    新华社1日讯  为了发展牲畜，尤其是养猪事业，国务院决定降低屠宰税率，不再征收牲肉营业税。财政部据此发出通知，规定：
    一、屠宰猪、羊、牛等七种牲畜的税率一律为8％。凡已纳屠宰税的，不分批发、零售或者自食、分食，都不再征收营业税和任何屠宰税附加。
    二、对屠宰税的计税价格规定：不论自食、出售、批发、零售、内销、出口、调拨、加工、价格高低和销售对象，一律按照当地国营公司或供销合作社的零售牌价计征；无零售牌价的，按当地市场零售价计征。
    三、对农民自养、自宰、自食的牲畜，除年节时期由省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会掌握予以适当免税外，平时不予免税。
    四、屠宰税计税标准，应当在屠宰牲畜时按照牲肉的实际重量计征。实际重量包括牲畜头、蹄、下水的折肉重量。如果在偏僻地区按实际重量计征确有困难时，仍可按照标准重量计征，但订定标准重量必须力求切合实际，避免偏高或偏低。
    以上规定自3月1日起实行。
