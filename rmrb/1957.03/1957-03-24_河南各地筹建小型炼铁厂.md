　　Various Places in Henan are Preparing to Build Small Iron Smelting Plants
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Henan Province is preparing to build a batch of small iron smelting plants. Currently, the construction of three plants in Jiaozuo, Anyang, and Yiyang has been determined. There are some large iron ore deposits near Xinyang, and relevant departments are actively surveying them. After the reserves are determined, medium or small-sized iron smelting plants will also be established.
    These small iron smelting plants have simple equipment and require little investment, but they yield quick results. A small iron smelting plant in Jiaozuo, which is being prepared by the Henan Provincial Department of Industry and is designed to produce 30 tons of pig iron per day, is expected to be completed in seven or eight months. In the future, depending on the iron ore reserves, there are plans to expand two more small iron smelting furnaces with a daily output of 30 tons each. In this way, 30,000 tons of pig iron can be produced annually, and its total investment will only be about 500,000 yuan. The small iron smelting plant in Anyang being built by the Anyang Prefectural Handicraft Industry Union, which is designed to produce seven tons per day, requires a total investment of less than 100,000 yuan and can be completed in three to four months.

　　河南各地筹建小型炼铁厂
    据新华社讯　河南省正在筹建一批小型炼铁厂，目前确定建设的有焦作、安阳、伊阳等三处。信阳附近有一些较大的铁矿，有关部门正在积极勘测，蕴藏量探清以后，也将建立中型或小型的炼铁厂。
    这些小型炼铁厂的设备简单，投资不多，但是收效很快。河南省工业厅正在焦作筹建的一个日产灰生铁三十吨的小型炼铁厂，预计七、八个月就可以建成。将来根据铁矿的蕴藏量，还打算扩建两个日产三十吨的小型炼铁炉。这样一年就可以出产生铁三万吨，而它的全部投资只不过五十万元左右。安阳专区手工业联合社正在安阳兴建的日产七吨的小型炼铁厂，全部投资不到十万元，三、四个月时间便能建成。
