It is necessary to educate people to recognize the great significance of promoting contraception and planned births, and to eliminate various concerns. Healthcare personnel must break away from the small circle of simply providing medical treatment and actively guide birth control. Mass organizations and industrial and commercial departments are required to vigorously promote it.

At the second session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference last February, I reported to you that our health work should be based on the glorious tasks assigned to it by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in the Forty-Article Program for Agricultural Development (draft). We must actively and wholeheartedly accomplish this glorious and great task, so that workers, peasants, and all laborers and their descendants can live healthier and happier lives. A year has passed, and with the decisive victory of the socialist transformation of the country, the national health work has made certain achievements and progress under the care and leadership of party and government at all levels, the efforts of all health personnel, and the support of the broad masses of the people. Not only have long-term plans for eliminating diseases been formulated, but we have also been mobilized to fight the diseases that are to be eliminated in the plan. According to the requirements of Article 26 of the Agricultural Program for the prevention and control of schistosomiasis, filariasis, hookworm disease, kala-azar, encephalitis, plague, and malaria, much progress has been made in the fight against these diseases. In particular, the fight against schistosomiasis, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Leading Group for the Prevention and Control of Schistosomiasis, has achieved greater results. In 1956, 400,000 patients were treated, and villages and townships that had eliminated snails appeared, gaining rich experience in prevention and control and increasing confidence in eliminating schistosomiasis within a certain period of time. Regarding the work of traditional Chinese medicine, it is necessary to further reverse the tendency to underestimate and reject it. In order to better inherit and carry forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine and give full play to its role, nearly 5,000 Western doctors have been organized to study traditional Chinese medicine (4,845 in on-the-job study classes and 303 in full-time study classes in six major cities), the practice of traditional Chinese medicine apprenticeship has been promoted and organized, four colleges of traditional Chinese medicine have been established, and 67 traditional Chinese medicine hospitals and more than 1,200 traditional Chinese medicine outpatient clinics have been established. In other aspects of marching towards science, strengthening scientific research, and in various health services such as health and epidemic prevention, medical prevention, maternal and child health, drug management, and medical education, much work has also been carried out. However, it should also be pointed out that the progress of some of our work is far behind the progress of national construction and the development of objective requirements. Whether in the implementation of the policy of prevention first, the implementation of the policy of traditional Chinese medicine, other medical prevention, health care, birth control and contraception, and the training and use of cadres, there are still major problems, some of which are very serious. Even the sanitation within our own organs is not done very well. I will not go into detail here, but will only report to you on the issue of contraception, which is of particular concern to everyone.

Over the past year, with the concern, guidance, and supervision of all parties on birth control work, we have attached importance to it and done a lot of work. We have actively and widely carried out contraception propaganda, published popular booklets on contraception, and printed a lot of propaganda posters in various places. We have held many lectures, seminars, and exhibitions, and showed slides, so that many people have a further understanding of contraception. Regarding contraception guidance, the Ministry of Health clearly required in its "Instructions on Contraception Work" issued in August 1956 that medical and health institutions at all levels must be responsible for providing contraception technical guidance, and that health leading departments at the provincial and municipal levels must train contraception guidance cadres. Large cities and industrial cities can also set up contraception guidance clinics as needed to specifically carry out contraception guidance work. Many places have done a lot of work according to this instruction. Regarding the supply of contraceptive tools and medicines, the situation in which drug sales departments could not openly sell and hospital pharmacies and health stations would not sell on behalf of others has been changed, making it inconvenient for people to buy contraceptive tools and medicines. In general, the quantity of contraceptive tools and medicines supplied has also been guaranteed to meet sales needs. The regulations on induced abortion and sterilization surgery have been revised, and the previous regulations that induced abortion was not allowed for any special needs or circumstances other than illness have been changed, so that these regulations are more in line with the requirements of people's different situations, etc. However, looking further, this work is still very insufficient. It is still far from the requirements of true planned parenthood. Regarding the understanding of contraception, many people still do not understand the great significance of this work for the construction and prosperity of our country, and for the happiness of individuals, families, and future generations. Some even think that contraception is inhumane, or that promoting contraception is a blow to new midwifery methods. These comrades have not seen that our country is a large country with a large population, and that various undertakings in our country's socialist construction are developing in a planned way. If the growth of our population is not a planned birth development, it will inevitably prevent our country from getting rid of poverty and achieving prosperity and strength more quickly. For example, if our population growth rate is calculated at 25 per thousand, it will increase by 15 million every year, and will reach more than 700 million in the second Five-Year Plan. In fact, due to the development of medical and health work and the improvement of living material conditions, the natural population growth rate will be more than this. As reported by the People's Daily, the Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Mill in Shanghai, with 7,000 employees, has had more children born to female workers in the past seven years than the number of employees in the factory. The Institute of Dermatology and Venereology, a unit directly under the Ministry, with 180 employees, has had 70 children born in the past three years. The population growth rate of these units has reached more than 100 per thousand. With such a high population growth rate, even if the growth rate of our industrial and agricultural production is very fast, it will inevitably be unable to better meet the needs of population growth. In particular, due to the large increase in children, nurseries, kindergartens, and primary schools will inevitably increase greatly, which will inevitably affect the development speed of national industrialization. For the happiness, health, work, study, and education of individuals, families, and future generations, the problem is even greater. Our fertility rate is indeed very high. As reported by the People's Daily, a survey by the Shanghai health department of 19 state-owned cotton mills found that among 609 pregnant female workers, 17% were pregnant twice a year, 53% were pregnant once a year on average, and 22% were pregnant twice in three years. Such excessive and dense births not only make it difficult for families to bear the burden and affect their own health, work, and study, but also make it difficult to take good care of and educate their children. A comrade from a health station in Beijing investigated 3,213 households in Dongwenchangge and Anfu Hutong, of which 643 households had more than four children, accounting for 20% of the total number of households. The average income of these families is about 80 yuan per month, and the average living expenses per person are less than 13 yuan (including adults). Five children average 10 yuan, and some with more children average less than 5 yuan. Therefore, malnutrition is serious. For example, a postal worker named Zhao on Shuncheng Street earns 70 yuan per month. His wife is 28 years old and has six children. Some of them suffer from rickets, and one daughter is about to become disabled due to illness. Now this woman is pregnant again. Another example is a worker named Sun in Jinglou Hutong, who works in a joint state-private meat shop and earns 40 yuan per month. His wife suffers from mental illness and has nine children (one of whom has been given away). This year, she had another miscarriage. For these, even if the state provides some welfare relief in the current situation, their difficult and embarrassing situation and the inability to take good care of and educate their children can be imagined. Although living conditions in rural areas are somewhat different, the problem of raising too many children too densely is also inevitably great, with an average income of only 40 to 50 yuan per year for each able-bodied laborer. Our 500 million peasant population has an average of 3 mu of land per person, but now, due to population growth, it can only average more than 2 mu of land. From this, it can be seen that birth control and contraception, appropriately adjusting birth density, and carrying out planned births are not only not immoral, but are precisely the manifestation of morality and the state's highly responsible performance to the people. Some people also believe that contraception is only a matter for women, and some husbands cannot even understand their wives' contraception requirements and moods. Not only can they not cooperate well, but they also quarrel and fight with their wives, which is even more wrong. As for some people who oppose contraception to new midwifery methods, it is obviously even more wrong. Contraception is for planned pregnancy and childbirth, and new midwifery methods refer to using scientific methods to receive and deliver pregnant fetuses, so that mothers and children are healthy. For newly born babies, we must protect and raise them well in accordance with the constitutional provision that "mothers and children are protected by the state." If we do not do so, it is truly immoral and violates the fundamental duties and tasks of health care work. In the future, in order to further improve this work, it is necessary to carry out contraception propaganda more deeply, so that everyone deeply recognizes the great significance of planned births for the country, for the family, for the individual, and for future generations. Make this propaganda known to every household and known to both men and women, and break down all obstacles to the wrong understanding of contraception. The guidance work on contraception is also still very insufficient. On the one hand, some people think that marriage and childbirth are "mysterious," unmentionable, and shameful. On the other hand, some health care personnel believe that this work does not belong to the scope of disease treatment and health care, and cannot actively and vigorously carry it out. In the future, we must break these views and recognize that having sons and daughters is a natural physiological phenomenon of marriage between men and women, and there is nothing "mysterious" or shameful about it. Appropriately controlling birth control and planned births are legitimate requirements. In this regard, health care personnel must break away from the small circle of simply providing medical treatment and health care, and regard guiding planned births and meeting the people's requirements for planned births as our due job responsibilities, especially all maternal and child health and midwifery personnel. The implementation of induced abortion and sterilization surgery in the future should mainly depend on individual voluntariness and abolish some restrictions, but this does not mean that we are advocating induced abortion, etc. This is a last resort in certain circumstances. Induced abortion not only harms women's bodies, work, and study, but also cannot achieve the purpose of birth control. The supply of contraceptive tools and medicines must be vigorously improved in the future. Further solutions should be found for some of the poor quality, some of the insufficient supply, and some of the high prices, so that the supply of tools and medicines can be closely coordinated with our propaganda and guidance to ensure the requirements of planned parenthood.

Now I want to introduce the decline in the population of ethnic minorities before liberation. In the past reactionary rule and long-term oppression of imperialism, ethnic minority areas in our country generally had low levels of health knowledge, many venereal diseases, low birth rates, and high death rates. Therefore, their population showed a year-by-year decline. Taking Inner Mongolia as an example, the Ikezhao League had a population of more than 400,000 in the early Qing Dynasty, but only 8,400 people were left in 1936. Another example is the Chen Barag Banner of the Hulunbuir League. Before liberation, an average of 87 people were born in the whole banner every year, but 113 people died. According to statistics in 1922, there were more than 7,000 people in the whole banner, but only more than 4,000 people in 1950.

After liberation, due to the vigorous development of venereal disease elimination work and maternal and child health work, the fertility rate of women has gradually increased, and the population has risen significantly. The Chen Barag Banner has increased by 310 people from 1950 to 1953, changing the trend of population decline over the years. Therefore, for many ethnic minorities, not only should contraception not be promoted, but they should also be encouraged and helped to increase their population reproduction.

Here, I should also point out that although contraception seems to be a specific task, according to the experience of the past few years, it is also an arduous and complex task. Especially at present, when this work is still in general calls for propaganda and instructions, and has not yet reached a strong organizational leadership, in addition to requiring the efforts of health departments and health personnel, we must also strengthen the common efforts of all sectors of society. Trade unions, women's federations, the Red Cross, and the Communist Youth League all have a unshirkable responsibility for organizing and promoting this work. The Ministry of Commerce, relevant industrial ministries, and the Ministry of Trade must regard the supply of tools and medicines as their duty, so as to do a good job in close cooperation with our propaganda and guidance to ensure the requirements of planned parenthood.
At this point, I also hope that party committees and governments at all levels can better strengthen their leadership over this work, so that this work can truly achieve the due results. (Attached picture)

    节育是一件艰巨复杂的工作
    李德全的发言
    应当教育人们认识到提倡避孕、提倡有计划生育的重大意义，消除种种顾虑——卫生保健人员必须打破单纯医疗看病的小圈子，积极指导节育——要求各个群众团体和工商部门大力宣传
    去年2月二届二次政协委员会议上，我曾向诸位报告，我们的卫生工作要很好的根据中共中央提出的发展农业四十条纲要（草案）所交给卫生工作的光荣任务，积极与全力的完成这个光荣伟大的任务，使工、农及一切劳动者们及其子子孙孙生活的更健康更幸福。现在一年过去了，卫生工作随着国家社会主义改造决定性的胜利，全国的卫生工作在各级党政的关怀领导、全体卫生人员的努力、广大人民的支持下，取得了一定的成绩与进展；不但已制定了消灭疾病的远景规划，而且已动员起来向计划中要消灭的疾病战斗。根据农业纲要第二十六条规定的对血吸虫病、血丝虫病、钩虫病、黑热病、脑炎、鼠疫、疟疾等的防治要求，在战斗中都取得了不少成绩；特别是对消灭血吸虫病的斗争，在中共中央防治血吸虫病九人小组的领导下，更取得较大的成绩。1956年已经治疗了患者四十万人，并出现消灭了钉螺的村和乡，获得了丰富的防治经验，提高了在一定时间内消灭血吸虫病的信心；对中医工作，要进一步扭转轻视排斥中医的思想与情况。为了很好的继承发扬祖国医学遗产及发挥中医的作用，已组织了将近五千多名西医学习中医（在职学习班四千八百四十五人，六大城市脱产学习班三百零三人），提倡和组织了中医带徒弟，成立了四所中医学院，建立了六十七所中医医院与一千二百多处中医门诊部；在其他向科学进军，加强科学研究，及对卫生防疫、医疗预防、妇幼卫生、药材管理、医学教育等各项卫生业务上，也都进行了不少的工作。但也应当说明的是，我们一些工作的进度比较国家建设的前进，比较客观要求的发展，还远远的落后。不论在预防为主方针的贯彻上，中医政策的执行上，其他医疗预防、卫生保健、节育避孕以及干部的培养使用等方面，都还有着很大的问题，有些问题还是非常严重的，甚至连我们自己机关内的卫生做得都非常不好，在此难予一一的详谈，仅就大家特别关心的避孕问题向大家报告一下。
    一年来，在各方面对避孕工作的关怀、指导、督促下，我们已予重视并做了不少工作，已积极广泛的开展了避孕宣传，出版了有关避孕的通俗小册子，各地印制了不少的宣传画，进行了不少的讲演、座谈、展览会，放映了幻灯，使不少人民群众对避孕有了进一步的认识；对进行避孕指导，卫生部在1956年8月发出的“关于避孕工作的指示”中，明确的要求各级医疗保健机构均须负责进行避孕技术指导工作，要求省、市等卫生领导部门必须训练避孕指导干部，大城市、工业城市并可按需要设立避孕指导门诊部，专门负责开展避孕指导工作，不少地方已根据这一指示做了不少工作；避孕工具、药品的供应，已改变了药品销售部门不能公开出销及医院药房和保健站不予代售等不便人民群众购买避孕工具、药品的情况，并在避孕工具、药品的供应数量上一般的也做到了保证销售需要；对人工流产与绝育手术的规定做了修改，对以往除疾病以外的不论任何特殊需要与情况不准施行人工流产等规定予以改变，使这规定更进一步符合人民群众不同情况的要求，等等。但进一步看来，这些工作还是非常不够的。距离真正的有计划的生育要求还相差极远；在对避孕的认识上，有不少人还不了解这一工作对我们国家的建设、富强，对个人家庭后代美满幸福的重大意义，甚至认为避孕是不人道，或说提倡避孕就是打击新法接生等。这些同志没看到，我们的国家是个人口众多的大国，在我们国家的社会主义建设中各项事业都是有计划的发展着，如我们人口的增长不是有计划的生育发展，就必将使我们的国家不能更快的摆脱贫困达到繁荣、富强。例如，如以我们的人口增长率按千分之二十五计算，每年就得增长一千五百万，第二个五年计划就达七亿以上。实际由于医药卫生工作的开展，生活物质等条件的改善，人口自然增长率还将不止此数。如人民日报已报道的上海七千职工的申新第九棉织厂，七年来女工们生的小孩子已超过该厂职工的数目。本部直属单位皮肤性病研究所一百八十个职工，三年来生育了七十个小孩子。这些单位人口的增长率已达千分之一百以上。这样高的人口增长率，我们工、农业生产的增长率纵然飞快，但也必将无法更好的满足人口增长的需要，特别由于孩子的大量的增长，托儿所、幼儿园、小学等就必然大大增长，这就必然影响到国家工业化的发展速度。在对个人、家庭、后代的幸福、健康、工作学习教养来说，问题更是很大。我们的生育率确是很高的，如人民日报已报道的上海卫生部门对十九个国棉厂的调查，在六百零九名怀孕的女工中，有17％一年连怀两胎，有53％每年平均妊娠一次，有22％三年妊娠两次。像这样过多过密的生育，不但使家庭难于负担，影响自己的健康、工作学习，并对已生的子女难于很好的照顾、教养。北京市一个保健站的同志们对东文昌阁及安福胡同三千二百一十三户的调查，其中有四个孩子以上的家庭六百四十三户，占总户数的20％。这些家庭的平均收入每户有八十元左右，平均每人生活费不到十三元
  （大人在内），五个孩子平均十元，孩子较多的还有的平均不到五元，因此营养不良症是严重的。如顺城街赵姓一邮局工作人员，每月收入七十元，其妻二十八岁，生了子女六人，有的患了软骨病，一女将病成残废，现在这位妇女又怀了孕。又如井楼胡同孙姓，公私合营肉铺工作人员，每月收入四十元，其妻患精神病，生了子女九人（有一名已送人），今年又流产一次。对于这些，即使国家在现时情况下有些福利救济，但其困难窘状及无法把已生儿女照顾教养得好是可想而知的。在农村中虽生活条件有所不同，但平均每个全劳动力每年仅收入四、五十元，过多过密的养育子女问题也必然很大。我们五亿农民人口平均每人三亩地，现在由于人口的增长，只能平均二亩多地。由此更可看出，节育避孕，适当的调剂生育密度，有计划地进行生育，不但不是不道德，而正是应有道德的表现，也是国家对人民高度负责的表现。在避孕中也有些人认为这只是妇女的事，有些丈夫甚至不能体谅妻子的避孕要求与心情，不但不能很好的配合合作，反而和自己的妻子吵嘴打架，这更是不对的。至于有的人把避孕和新法接生对立起来，则显然更是错误的。避孕是为了有计划的怀孕与生育，新法接生是指已孕的胎儿用科学的方法收生，使母子健康。对已新生的婴儿，我们就必须按着宪法“母亲和儿童受国家的保护”的规定要很好的保护育养，如不如此，这才真的是不道德，而且违背了卫生保健工作的根本职责任务。今后，为了进一步做好这一工作，必须更深入的开展避孕的宣传，使每个人深刻认识到有计划的生育对国家对家庭对个人对后代的重大意义。使这一宣传做到家喻户晓，男女皆知，打破一切对避孕错误认识的障碍。对避孕的指导工作，也还是做的很不够，一方面有些人认为结婚生孩子“神秘”不可告人而且可羞，一方面有些卫生医疗保健人员认为这一工作不属疾病治疗与卫生保健范围，不能积极主动的大力进行。今后要求打破这些观点，应认识生男育女是男女结婚的自然生理现象，没有什么“神秘”与可羞的，适当的控制节育和有计划的生育是正当的要求。对此，卫生保健人员更必须打破单纯医疗看病保健的小圈子，把指导有计划的生育，满足人民群众有计划的生育要求视作我们应有的工作职责，尤其是一切妇幼保健助产有关人员，对人工流产及绝育手术的施行，今后当主要取决于个人的自愿，废除一些限制，但这并不等于是意味着在提倡人工流产等，这是在一定情况下不得已而为之，人工流产不但对妇女身体工作学习等有所损害，并且也不能达到节育的目的。对避孕工具药品的供应，今后还必须大力改善，对有些质量不高，有些供应不足，有些价格过高等，应当设法进一步解决，使工具药品的供应和我们的宣传、指导密切配合做好，以保证计划生育的要求。
    我现在要介绍一下解放前少数民族人口下降的情况。我国少数民族地区几百年来，在过去的反动统治与帝国主义的长期压迫下，普遍存在卫生知识的水平低，性病多，出生率低，死亡率高的现象，因此他们的人口表现是逐年下降的。以内蒙古为例，伊克昭盟在清朝初年有人口四十多万，到1936年只剩下八千四百余人。又如呼伦贝尔盟陈巴尔虎旗，解放前全旗平均每年出生八十七人，但死亡是一百一十三人，据1922年统计，全旗有七千多人，至1950年只有四千多人。
    解放后，由于驱梅工作及妇幼卫生工作的大力开展，妇女生育率也逐渐提高，人口显著上升，陈巴尔虎旗从1950年至1953年净增加三百一十人，改变了历年来人口下降的趋势。因此，对于许多少数民族不但不提倡避孕，而且应当鼓励帮助他们增加人口的繁殖。
    于此，我也当提出，避孕虽看来是一项具体工作，但根据几年来的体会，这也是一件艰巨复杂的工作，特别在目前这一工作尚处在一般号召宣传指示，而尚没有达到具有强有力的组织领导的时候，除了要求除卫生部门卫生人员的努力外，还必须加强社会各方面的共同努力。对这一工作的组织推动，工会、妇联、红十字会、青年团等都是责无旁贷。对做好工具药品的供应，商业部、有关工业部、贸易部等则必须视做分内职责。在此也就更希望各级党政更好的加强对这一工作的领导，以便使这一工作真正做出应有的成绩。（附图片）
