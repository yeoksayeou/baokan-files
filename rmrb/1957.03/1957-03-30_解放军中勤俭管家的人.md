　　Frugal Stewards in the People's Liberation Army
　　Xinhua News Agency reporter Yu Fengyuan, Han Qingxiang
　　These past few days, we have been at the Chinese People's Liberation Army's All-Army Logistics Advanced Workers Representative Conference, interviewing many people who are devoted to managing the household affairs for the troops. Here, we introduce those who, in their ordinary work positions, bury themselves in hard work day and night, thus accomplishing many extraordinary deeds.
          Diligent and Conscientious Laundry Worker
　　Liu Xiyun is a laundry worker in a hospital stationed in the Lanzhou area. In her view, washing clothes is an honorable service for the sick and wounded. Therefore, since February 1953, she has diligently completed her task for four years as if it were one day.
　　When she first arrived at the hospital (initially a sanatorium), there was no laundry room or drying area. She and two other female workers used only two large wooden basins and two washboards to wash the work clothes of more than two hundred people, as well as the clothes, quilts, sheets, and pillowcases of the convalescents. The difficulties are self-evident. Later, although a simple shed was built, it still did not provide shelter from the rain in summer or from the wind in winter. However, Liu Xiyun never paid attention to these difficulties. Every day, they collected the laundry to be washed, washed it piece by piece, dried it, folded it neatly, and returned it until seven o'clock in the evening when everything was done before going home. Because the laundry shed was very simple, she encountered countless hardships: whenever it rained, the shed leaked everywhere, soaking her clothes, which she would take off, wring out, and put back on to continue working. In the cold winter, the shed was covered with ice, and the water splashed on her body would freeze. The cold wind blew snowflakes into the shed, landing on her body, sometimes causing her hands and feet to become red and swollen, but she never complained or stopped working because of this. The leadership gave her charcoal for heating, but she did not use it for herself, instead using it to dry urgently needed clothing. It was not until the establishment of a laundry room at the end of 1955 that these difficult working conditions were changed.
　　When the number of convalescents increased, there were too many things to wash, and the leadership proposed hiring temporary workers to help them, but they always refused. She said, "If we put in a little more effort, we can save the public money, which is also supporting national construction!" Sometimes when it was really too busy, she would come to work early on holidays as usual. The leadership advised her to rest, but she said, "I can't sit still at home, I'm always thinking about the clothes that haven't been washed." Before the Spring Festival this year, the leadership asked her to start her vacation from the 28th day of the twelfth lunar month so that she could take care of her husband and three children and prepare for the festival. However, in order to avoid the state spending money to hire temporary workers because of her vacation, or because the backlog of clothes would affect the needs of the sick and wounded, she insisted on going to work every day until four o'clock in the afternoon on New Year's Eve, when she had washed enough clothes for five days before going home to take care of her family's preparations for the festival.
　　Because of her enthusiasm for serving the sick and wounded and her loyalty to her work, she carefully improved her work methods, increased work efficiency, and saved the state funds bit by bit. At first, she washed each item individually with soap, which used a lot of soap - one bar could only wash a dozen items - and took a long time - she could only wash more than sixty items a day. Later, she dissolved the soap in water, separated the large and small items and the clothes with different degrees of dirt, first rubbed them in the water, and then washed them with soapy water. In this way, one person could wash about ninety to one hundred and twenty items a day, and one bar of soap could wash more than twenty items, and it was as clean as it used to be. Once, she accepted the task of dismantling and washing one hundred and forty-five blue cotton coats and fifty-two cotton door curtains. In order to prevent the alkaline nature of the soap from washing away the color of the coats, she bought eight kilograms of soapberries for nine jiao and six fen, smashed them into powder, soaked them in warm water overnight, boiled them the next day, filtered them clean with a sieve, and then put the coats that had been soaked in cold water into the soapberry water to wash. As a result, not only was it washed very clean and the color was bright, but it also saved seven yuan and four jiao compared to washing with soap. Because of her patience and hard work, no clothes she washed in the past four years have been lost or any errors occurred.
　　In her year after year of work, Liu Xiyun has checked out many watches, pens, military emblems, badges, and many valuables from the pockets of the clothes and trousers to be washed, including a hundred-yuan passbook and forty-five yuan in cash. Each time, she handed them over to the original owner on the same day, or to the organization to try to find out the owner. Liu Xiyun's noble qualities have left a very deep impression in the minds of all the staff and the sick and wounded in this hospital.
            A Master at Saving Coal
　　In a company of the People's Liberation Army stationed near Haicheng, Liaoning Province, guests from various fraternal units and government agencies are frequently received. These guests all come to learn coal-burning experience from cook Zhao Haixiang.
　　Zhao Haixiang is specially responsible for burning firewood in the cooking squad. He loves his work very much. According to him: "No matter what work you do, it is to serve the people, so you must do it well." At that time, smokeless coal was burned, and his coal-burning skills were not proficient. On average, each person used two jin and three liang of coal per day (Northeast scale, the same below). However, the standard stipulated by the superiors was only one jin and four liang. Zhao Haixiang was very anxious when he saw this situation. Four years ago, he was still a coal miner. At that time, there was a saying among coal miners: "Pick a piece of meat from four pieces of stone". It was not easy to mine coal from strata surrounded by stones. Therefore, he made up his mind to save the amount of coal burned.
　　From then on, he tried every means to improve the stove and coal-burning methods. In the spring of 1955, the stoves they used were round, straight-barreled, large and deep. The pot was hung on top, and the bottom of the pot was very far from the flame, and many flames escaped from the chimney. Therefore, he changed the stove to a rectangular shape, reducing the stove chamber by one-third, thereby reducing the diffusion of firepower and reducing the amount of coal burned to one jin and two liang. Later, the stove was changed to a semi-circular shape, narrow in the front and wide in the back, and the stove bar was only sixty to seventy centimeters high from the bottom of the pot. In this way, the amount of coal was small and the firepower was concentrated, and the amount of coal burned was reduced to nine liang per person per day. However, he was not satisfied with the existing results, and further reduced the number of stove bars from seven to two. In this way, there was less bottom fire in the stove, and the amount of coal added was also reduced accordingly. In addition, by appropriately mastering the ratio of soil mixed in the coal and reasonably improving the timing and method of picking fire, the amount of coal burned was reduced to only four liang per person per day (equivalent to six liang and four qian on the market scale). In this way, from July 1955, in just sixteen months, he saved 115 tons of coal.
　　Zhao Haixiang's experience in saving coal has aroused the attention of leaders at all levels of the troops in the Shenyang area, and it has been quickly promoted in the troops, government agencies, schools, and the masses. Since May 1955, Zhao Haixiang has been invited to introduce stove modification methods and coal-burning methods to fraternal troops in many places such as Shenyang and Lüda, and to help fraternal troops transform some stoves. He also introduced his methods and experience at the experience exchange meeting of chefs from Haicheng County agencies and schools and squad leaders of canteens of the garrison troops. At present, many troops, government agencies, schools, and the masses have adopted his methods. After units such as Haicheng High School and Normal School reformed the stoves according to his method, the amount of coal burned per person per day was reduced to only five or six liang.
          A Food Station on the Top of a Snowy Mountain
　　Along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, on the uninhabited Tanggula Mountain, 5,100 meters above sea level, it is a world of ice and snow for six months of the year. There is no tree, no grass, and the air is thin. People who come here for the first time will be out of breath after walking a few steps faster. The rice here cannot be cooked well, and originally, people could only eat half-cooked noodles every day.
　　But right here, there is a very famous food station. It was established last January by the Transportation Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet.
　　Wu Jizhong, the cooking squad leader of the unit, is responsible for the work of this food station. He led all the staff to overcome many difficulties, started sprouting soybeans, making tofu, and making jelly here, and ensured that passing car drivers could eat noodles, sliced noodles, and steamed buns, and sometimes dumplings. They maintained that the drivers who came and went could eat two dishes and one soup per meal.
　　They settled down here and set up tents on the icy and snowy ground. The strong winds on the plateau often tore the tents, making people unable to sleep all night, so they started making adobe and adding wind-proof earthen walls around the tents.
　　There is no firewood, and the cow dung transported from 400 li away is burned.
　　In the interior, it is not new for people to eat steamed buns, but it is not a simple matter on this plateau more than 5,000 meters above sea level. It took them a week to find the law of cooking rice well.
　　In order to improve the food, it is not enough to rely on the kelp, pickled vegetables, soybeans, peanuts, and egg yolk powder received. If you want to sprout soybeans, the beans will freeze into ice cubes in the water. What should I do? Wu Jizhong thought of building a shed with stones, putting soybeans in a broken wooden box on it, and lighting cow dung under the stone shed to keep it warm. In this way, the bean sprouts came out.
　　There are always a hundred or so car teams eating and staying here. In January of this year, there were several days of heavy wind and snow on Tanggula Mountain, and the snow was more than one person deep. Many cars were blocked. The food station, which can only receive more than one hundred people at a time, was occupied by more than three hundred people. There were only nine cooks at the food station, and they had to cook three times for hundreds of people to eat a meal. The car team stayed here for five days, but the cooks still ensured that they had two dishes and one soup.
　　Over the past year, this food station has received tens of thousands of car drivers. Car drivers always like to drive an extra distance to stop at this food station and often bring raisins and watermelon to send to the comrades at this food station.
　　On the highway, there is more than one such food station. Many such food stations are distributed on the Kangzang Highway and the Qinghai-Tibet Highway. It is these comrades at the food stations who have settled down on the plateau for years and months, doing ordinary but arduous work, that ensure that the transportation troops can eat well and get accommodation and rest.
          Soldiers Love the Tailor
　　In the various units of the People's Liberation Army, tailors push small carts, carrying sewing tools and sewing cloth, traveling throughout many units, diligently sewing and mending clothes for the soldiers.
　　Here, it is only mentioned that in a certain unit of the garrison on an island, there is a tailor named Huang Jinfu, who, in more than three months, sewed and mended more than 2,700 pieces of clothing, 25 shoulder pads, and 299 waterproof coats for the soldiers. This solved many difficulties for the soldiers and also saved a lot of wealth for the country.
　　Huang Jinfu loves his work very much. Every time he goes to a unit, bags of clothes are sent to him. He always patiently looks through them one by one, studying how to repair them well and save materials. Some clothes, which others think are too badly damaged to repair, he always patiently says: "It's okay, it can be repaired, put it down!" When he sews each piece of clothing neatly and sees the soldiers happily taking them away, he is truly unspeakably happy. Some soldiers can't help but say a few words of gratitude when they receive the repaired clothes, and he always says: "Who do you work for, who do I work for, isn't it the same?"
　　So many tailors love their work, regardless of wind, rain, or muddy roads, serving the soldiers loyally, and the soldiers love and respect them from the bottom of their hearts. (Attached picture)

　　解放军中勤俭管家的人
　　新华社记者  于逢源  韩庆祥
    这几天，我们在中国人民解放军全军后勤先进工作者代表会议上，访问了许多忠心耿耿地为部队管理家务的人。这里所介绍的，是那些在平凡的工作岗位上，日日夜夜埋头苦干，从而做出了许多并不平凡的事迹的人们。
          勤勤恳恳的洗衣工
    刘喜云是驻兰州地区部队医院里的洗衣工人。在她看来，洗衣服是为伤病员服务的一件很光荣的工作。因此，她从1953年2月以来，四年如一日，出色地完成了自己的任务。
    当她刚到医院（起初是疗养院）的时候，没有洗衣房，也没有晒衣场。她和另外两个女工，只用两个大木盆和两块搓板，来洗涤二百多人的工作服和休养员的衣服、被子、床单、枕头等等，困难是不言而喻的。后来，虽然搭起了一个简单的席棚，还是夏不遮雨，冬不挡风。但是，刘喜云从未把这些困难看在眼里。她们每天把当天要洗的衣物收集起来，一件件地洗好、晒干，又叠得平平正正的交回去，直到晚上七点钟，一切都做完了才回家去。由于洗衣棚非常简陋，曾使她遇到无数的艰辛：每逢下雨，席棚里到处漏水，淋湿了她的衣服，她脱下来拧干后穿到身上继续工作。在寒冷的冬季里，席棚里遍地是冰，溅到身上的水点也结了冰。寒风卷着雪花吹进席棚里，落在她的身上，有时手、脚都冻得红肿了，但是她从来没有因此而叫苦或停止工作。领导上发给她烤火的木炭，她自己不用，却用来烘烤急用的衣物。直到1955年底建立了洗衣房，才改变了这种艰苦的工作条件。
    当休养员增多的时候，要洗的东西太多了，领导上提出要找临时工来帮助她们工作，但每次都被她们拒绝了。她说：“我们多出点力，替公家省下一笔钱，也是支援祖国建设啊！”有时实在太忙了，在假日里她也像平时一样地早早赶来工作。领导上劝她休息，她却说：“在家里坐不住，心里老是惦记着没有洗完的衣服。”今年春节前夕，领导上要她从农历腊月28日起开始休假，以便为丈夫和三个孩子料理一下家务准备过节。但是，她为了免得因为自己休假使国家花钱另雇临时工，或者因为积压了很多衣物洗不出来影响伤病员的需要，还是每天坚持上班，直到除夕那天下午四点多钟，她把足够五天用的衣物都洗好了，才回家去料理自己家里过节的事情。
    由于她热心为伤病员服务和忠于自己的工作，因此，她认真地改进了工作方法，提高了工作效率，并且为国家一点一滴地节约了资金。起初，她所洗的东西是一件一件的搓肥皂来洗，这样，用的肥皂又多——一条肥皂只能洗十几件，又费时间——一天只能洗六十多件。后来，她把肥皂化成水，把大件小件和污黑程度不同的衣物分开来先在水里搓过，再用肥皂水洗，这样，一个人每天能洗九十多件到一百二十件左右，一条肥皂能洗二十多件，而且和过去洗的一样干净。有一次，她接受了拆洗一百四十五件蓝色棉大衣、五十二件棉门帘的任务。为了不至因为肥皂的碱性大而把大衣的颜色洗掉了，她便用九角六分钱买了八斤皂角，砸成粉末，用温水浸泡了一夜，第二天煮沸后，用箩子过滤干净，然后把在冷水里浸透了的大衣放到皂角水里洗。结果，不但洗得很干净、色泽很光亮，而且比用肥皂洗还节省了七元四角钱。由于她耐心、踏实地工作，四年来，经她洗涤的衣服，从没有丢失过一件或发生过任何差误。
    在年复一年的工作中，刘喜云曾在要洗涤的衣裤口袋中，检查出不少的手表、钢笔、军徽、胸章和很多财物，其中包括一百元的活期存折和四十五元现款。每一次她都在当天就交给原主，或者交给组织上设法查明失主。刘喜云这种高贵的品质，在这个医院的全体工作人员和伤病员的心目中，都留下了极为深刻的印象。
            节约烧煤的能手
    驻在辽宁省海城附近的解放军的一个连队里，经常接待着来自各个兄弟部队和政府机关的客人，这些客人都是来向炊事员赵海祥学习烧煤经验的。
    赵海祥在炊事班里专门负责烧火。他十分热爱自己的工作。照他的说法：“不管做什么工作，都是为人民服务，就一定要做好。”当时，烧的是无烟煤，他烧煤的技术也不熟练，平均每人每天要用二斤三两煤（东北秤，下同）但是，上级规定的标准却是一斤四两多。赵海祥看到这种情形，心里很着急。四年前，他还是一个煤矿工人，当时在采煤工人中有这样一句话：“四块石头拣块肉”，从四面夹着石头的地层中采出煤来是不容易的。所以，他下定决心要节省烧煤的数量。
    从这时起，他便想尽一切办法来改进炉灶和烧煤方法。1955年春，他们用的炉灶是圆形直桶式的，又大又深，锅吊在上面，锅底距火焰很高，很多火焰都从烟囱里走掉了。于是，他把炉灶改为长方形，使灶膛缩小三分之一，从而减少了火力的扩散，使烧煤量减到一斤二两。后来，又把灶改为半圆形的，前窄后宽，炉条到锅底只有六七十公分高，这样，容煤量少，火力集中，一下子便把烧煤量降低到每人每天九两。但是，他还是不满足于已有的成绩，进一步又把炉条由七根减为两根，这样，灶里的底火少了，添煤的数量也随着减少了。加上恰当地掌握了煤中掺土的比例，合理地改进挑火的时机和方法，就使得烧煤量降低到每人每天只用四两（合市秤六两四钱）。就这样，从1955年7月起，仅仅十六个月中，便节省烧煤一百一十五吨。
    赵海祥节省烧煤的经验引起了沈阳地区部队各级领导机关的重视，并且很快地在部队、政府机关、学校和群众中推广开来了。从1955年5月份起，赵海祥曾被邀请到驻沈阳、旅大等许多地方的兄弟部队中去介绍改灶方法和烧煤方法，帮助兄弟部队改造了一些炉灶。他还在海城县机关、学校的厨师与驻军各伙食单位的炊事班长经验交流大会上，介绍了他的方法和经验。目前，很多部队、政府机关、学校和群众当中都采用了他的方法。海城高中、师范学校等单位按照他的方法改灶后，每人每天烧煤量也降到了只有五两、六两。
          雪山顶上的饭站
    沿青藏公路，在拔海五千一百公尺的渺无人烟的唐古拉山上，一年之中有六个月是冰天雪地，没有一棵树，不生一根草，而且空气稀薄。初到这里的人，稍为快走几步，就会喘不过气来。这里饭都不能煮熟，原来每天只能吃点半生的面块。
    可是就在这里，有一个很出名的饭站。它是去年1月由中国人民解放军驻西藏运输部队设立的。
    负责这个饭站工作的是部队炊事班长吴继忠。他带领着全班人员，克服了许多困难，动手在这里生起豆芽、做起豆腐、做起凉粉来，而且保证过往的汽车司机们能够吃到面条、面片、包子，有时包饺子。他们保持了来往司机每顿吃到两菜一汤。
    他们在这里安了家，冰天雪地上架起了帐篷。高原上的大风常常把帐篷撕裂，害得人们彻夜不能安眠，于是又动手打土坯，在帐篷四周加上了挡风的土墙。
    没有柴火，烧的是从四百里外运来的牛粪。
    在内地，人们吃馒头并不新鲜，可是在这个拔海五千多公尺的高原上，却是一件不简单的事了。他们花了一个星期的时间才找到把饭做熟的规律。
    为了改善伙食，单靠领来的海带、榨菜、黄豆、花生米、蛋黄粉是不行的。想发豆芽，豆子泡在水里便冻成了冰块。怎样办呢？吴继忠想法  用石头搭了个棚，用破木箱盛着黄豆放在上面，把牛粪放在石棚底下点着火保温。这样豆芽才发出来了。
    经常在这里吃饭、住宿的车队总有一百来人。今年1月里，唐古拉山上连续几天大风雪，积雪有一人多深。许多车子被阻住了。平时只能接待一百多人的饭站，却住上了三百多人。饭站上只有九个炊事员，几百人吃一顿饭，他们就要做三次。车队共在这里住了五天，可是炊事员们仍然保证他们吃到二菜一汤。
    一年来，这个饭站接待了成千上万的汽车司机。汽车司机们也总是喜欢多赶一段路，到这个饭站歇脚，并且常常特地带些葡萄干、西瓜来送给这个饭站的同志。
    在公路线上，像这样的饭站并不止一个。许多这样的饭站，分布在康藏公路和青藏公路线上。就是这些饭站的同志们，长年累月在高原上安了家，做着平凡而艰巨的工作，才保证了运输部队能够吃好饭，得到住宿和休息。
          战士们热爱缝衣兵
    在解放军的各部队里，缝衣兵们手推着小车，带着缝纫工具和缝衣布，走遍许多单位，勤勤恳恳地为战士们缝补衣服。
    这里只提到，在一个海岛上的驻军某部里，有一位缝衣兵叫黄锦福，他在三个多月的时间内，共计为战士们缝补了两千七百多件衣服、二十五件护肩、两百九十九件防水衣。这给战士们解决了不少困难，同时也为国家节省了大量财富。
    黄锦福非常热爱自己的工作，每到一个部队，一包包的衣服送到他的面前，他总是一件件地耐心的翻看，研究着怎样把它修的又好又省料。有些衣服，别人看来破得实在不好修补了，可是他总是耐心地说：“行啊，能补，放下吧！”当他把一件件衣服缝补得平平整整，看着战士们高高兴兴地拿走时，他真是说不出的高兴。有些战士拿到补好的衣服免不了说几句感激话，他总是说：“你们为谁工作，我为谁工作，还不是一样吗？”
    多少的缝衣兵们，就是这样地热爱着自己的工作，不分刮风、下雨、道路泥泞，忠心耿耿地为士兵服务，而士兵们则是从心眼里爱戴他们。（附图片）
