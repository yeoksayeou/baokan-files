　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 27th. Polish Premier Józef Cyrankiewicz and Indian Prime Minister Nehru signed a joint statement on the 27th. A cultural agreement between Poland and India was also signed on the afternoon of the 27th.

　　Cyrankiewicz and the Polish government delegation he led left Delhi on the afternoon of the 27th to visit rural development projects in Sonipat. From there, they will visit Bakra-Nangal, Chandigarh, Agra, Bangalore, Bombay, Calcutta, and other places in India.

　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 27th. Polish Premier Józef Cyrankiewicz said today: "A collective security system is the most effective way for all countries to ensure border security and guarantee peace."

　　He said at a press conference in Delhi that only those who are "creating treaties that are now or may become treaties of aggression in the future" would oppose a collective security system. He also pointed out that "only a genuine collective security system can replace genuine defensive treaties like the Warsaw Pact."

　　Cyrankiewicz said: "India has full sovereignty over Kashmir" and "Goa should belong to India." He refuted Portugal's colonialist arguments, saying: "All countries should base their living standards on their own work, not on the exploitation of other countries."

　　He emphasized the close relationship between socialist countries based on equality and sovereignty. He said that the path to building socialism varies according to the specific conditions of each country.

　　He also said that socialist and capitalist countries should coexist peacefully and engage in peaceful competition.

　　Cyrankiewicz pointed out that economic cooperation between Poland and India can be further expanded.

　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 27th. Polish Premier Józef Cyrankiewicz delivered a speech to members of the Indian Parliament in the Central Hall of Parliament on the afternoon of March 26th.

　　Cyrankiewicz said: The consensus between India and Poland on many fundamental issues of international policy creates a basis for the two parliaments to take joint action to consolidate world peace.

　　Cyrankiewicz introduced the history of the Polish Parliament (its broad base of united parties with common socialist ideals) and the role of the Polish Parliament in correcting past shortcomings.

　　He said: We are convinced that our new parliament will be able to play its role more effectively than ever before in defending peace, easing international tensions, and creating a collective security system.

　　After speaking in Parliament, Cyrankiewicz gave a lengthy speech on Polish foreign policy at the Indian Council of World Affairs and answered some questions. Thousands of listeners gave his speech a warm round of applause.

　　Cyrankiewicz visited the Gandhi cremation site in Rajghat that morning and laid a wreath at Gandhi's tomb. He also held talks with Prime Minister Nehru. In the evening, he held a banquet to thank his Indian hosts.

    西伦凯维兹说：“印度对克什米尔拥有全权”，“果阿应该归印度”。他驳斥了葡萄牙的殖民主义论点，他说：“一切国家都应该以它自己的工作而不是以对其他国家的剥削来作为自己国家生活水平的保证。”
    他强调了社会主义国家在平等和主权的基础上建立的密切关系。他说，建设社会主义的道路根据每个国家特有的条件而有所不同。
    他还说，社会主义国家和资本主义国家之间应该和平共处，和平竞赛。

    西伦凯维兹说：印度和波兰在国际政策的许多基本问题上的一致看法为两国议会创造了采取巩固世界和平的共同行动的基础。
    西伦凯维兹介绍了波兰议会（它的具有共同的社会主义理想的各政党联合的广泛基础）的历史，并且还介绍了波兰议会在纠正过去的缺点方面所起的作用。
    他说：我们深信，我们的新议会将能够比以前任何时候更有效地在保卫和平、缓和国际紧张局势和创造集体安全体系方面发挥它的作用。
