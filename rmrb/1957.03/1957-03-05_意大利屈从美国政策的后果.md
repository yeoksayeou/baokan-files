    The Consequences of Italy's Subservience to US Policy
    Li Banduo
    After World War II, the Italian ruling group, for the sake of the interests of monopoly capital, attempted to rely on American imperialism to restore and develop its own power, accepting "US aid" with serious conditions. This "aid" did bring some benefits to certain monopoly capital and supported the reactionary rule of Italy; but it brought many evils to the entire Italian nation.
    Since the war, Italy has received more than 5.1 billion US dollars in various forms of "US aid." The targets of these "aids" are mainly government-controlled enterprises and large monopoly capital groups. For example: in several industrial investments under the "Marshall Plan," 42.5% was given to the electrical industry monopoly group, of which the Edison monopoly group alone received half; 35.5% to the Fiat Group in the automobile manufacturing industry; 17% to the Finsider Group in the steel industry; only 6% was given to other non-monopoly groups of enterprises. These investments helped the Italian monopoly capital enterprises to update their equipment after the war, enabling their production to be improved to a certain extent, their profits increased, and their concentration strengthened. However, at the same time, many small and medium-sized enterprises that were unable to compete with them closed down, especially in the textile industry. From 1948 to July 1953, 134 textile industries closed down in the provinces of Milan, Varese, and Florosa alone. In the first quarter of 1956, the output of the textile industry was 1.3% lower than in the same period of 1955. Therefore, even the American magazine "U.S. News & World Report" said, "Many unbiased economists... also believe that US aid has strengthened monopoly capital and weakened free enterprise."
    The further concentration of capital and the continuous closure of small and medium-sized enterprises have exacerbated unemployment and poverty in Italy. Last July, the Pirelli Rubber Company, which employed 14,000 workers, laid off 1,000 workers at once. At present, Italy has two million unemployed and two million semi-employed workers.
    Italy's acceptance of "US aid" has also made it a market for the dumping of surplus materials from the United States. In the past two years, the United States has allocated several loans to Italy, totaling nearly 200 million US dollars, for the purpose of purchasing surplus materials from the United States. Through this loan, the United States' surplus materials flowed into the Italian market. Many of these are commodities that Italy did not need to import, thus creating a crisis of oversupply of Italy's own agricultural products.
    The United States made Italy implement a "free trade" policy, allowing American goods to flood the Italian market. However, the United States itself has built high tariff barriers, thus creating a huge deficit for Italy in US-Italian trade. In the four years of the "Marshall Plan," Italy's total import value increased by 71%, while its total export value increased by only 35%. In the first half of 1956, Italy's total imports from the United States were 151.4 billion lire, while the total exports to the United States were only 54.8 billion lire. At the same time, the United States has also restricted and prohibited Italy from trading with socialist countries in various ways, thus reducing Italy's favorable trade with socialist countries. This has made Italy's foreign trade less flexible. With the rapid development of industry in countries such as West Germany and Japan and the increasing competition in the capitalist world market, Italy's foreign trade difficulties have become greater and greater.
    In order to strengthen its control over the Italian economy, the United States agreed with the Italian government in September 1951 to revise the "Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation" signed in 1948, further opening a door for American monopoly capital to infiltrate the Italian economy. According to this treaty, American monopoly capitalists have the right to purchase or lease any factory or land, acquire stocks, and enjoy patent rights in Italy. In the past few years, the United States has used these privileges to control many important industrial enterprises in Italy. For example, General Motors of the United States controls 90% of the total automobile industrial production in Italy; DuPont controls 75% of all chemical industrial products in Italy; the Italian oil industry is almost entirely controlled by the two American oil companies, "Gulf" and "Mobil"; 85% of Italian petrol stations are owned by American capital.
    Since Italy makes its economy dependent on the United States, it also succumbs to the policies of the United States in diplomacy. In recent years, the Italian government has been following the US "Cold War" policy and actively participating in the activities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. As a direct consequence of Italy's pursuit of US policy, the heavy military expenditure burden is placed on the shoulders of the Italian people. Last June, the Italian House of Representatives passed the military budget for the 1956-1957 fiscal year as 516.3 billion lire, an increase of 29.2 billion lire over the previous fiscal year, almost twice that of the 1948-1949 fiscal year. Huge military expenditures and long-term trade imbalances have led to continuous inflation. The constantly rising prices have become a constant threat to the lives of Italian workers. According to materials published by the Italian Central Bureau of Statistics, the cost of living in Italy rose by another 4.1% last year. Reuters said in a message: After the war, the slums in Rome have continued to expand, and many Italian residents live in dirty huts, caves, and even ancient tombs on the outskirts of Rome. The situation in the capital is like this, and the countryside and other areas are even more so. In order to improve the unbearable living conditions, three million agricultural workers in Italy held a 48-hour general strike last July.
    According to the arrangement of the North Atlantic Treaty, many American military bases have been built in Italy. The US military controls more than one hundred Italian air bases. Recently, a new type of American "Corporal" long-range missile has been shipped to Italy and supplied to the US Southern European Tactical Air Force Command for installation in the strategic area of Vicenza in northern Italy. The US Sixth Fleet uses the ports of Livorno, Naples, Palermo, Taranto and Brindisi as bases. The US military also enjoys extraterritorial rights in Italy. This military deployment of the United States has placed Italy under American military occupation, undermining its sovereignty, and running the risk of being used by the United States as a base for launching new wars.
    The results of the Italian government's subservience to US policy over the past ten years have proved that this not only does not truly revive the Italian national economy as the Italian authorities boast, but also causes more and more damage to Italian national rights. Therefore, far-sighted Italians, in order to safeguard the national interests of their country, have more than once opposed the Italian government's subservience to US policy, demanding the implementation of an independent and autonomous policy, improving relations with socialist countries, and expanding trade to improve the Italian situation and improve the people's lives. The "Milan Daily" expressed the opinions of some business people. It wrote: "For the benefit of Italian merchants, we do not ask for foreign help and protection, we only ask that they be allowed to trade freely in international trade, like merchants from other Western countries, without hindrance. Our government must consider this issue from a comprehensive and practical point of view." With the increasing obviousness of the evils of "US aid" and the North Atlantic policy, and the gradual deterioration of trade conditions, this call for "freedom to trade" without "help and protection" is becoming more and more common in Italy.

    意大利屈从美国政策的后果
    黎邦铎
    在第二次世界大战以后，意大利统治集团为了垄断资本的利益，企图依赖美国帝国主义，恢复和发展自己的势力，接受了带有严重条件的“美援”。这种“援助”的确使某些垄断资本得到了一些好处，并且支持了意大利的反动统治；却给意大利整个国家带去了许多恶果。
    意大利在战后接受的各种形式的“美援”共达五十一亿多美元。这些“美援”的对象主要是由政府控制的企业和大垄断资本集团。例如：“马歇尔计划”项下的几次工业投资中，42.5％是给电气工业垄断集团，其中大垄断集团爱迪生一家就获得一半；35.5％给汽车制造业的菲亚特集团；17％是给钢铁业的芬西德集团；只有6％给予其他非垄断集团的企业。这些投资帮助了战后意大利垄断资本企业更新它们的设备，使得它们的生产得到一定的提高，利润有了增加，并加强了它们集中的程度。但是，同时却使得无力同它们竞争的中小企业纷纷倒闭，其中尤以纺织工业中的情况为最严重。从1948年到1953年7月，仅仅在米兰、瓦雷萨、佛劳罗萨这几个省份中就倒闭了一百三十四家纺织工业，1956年第一季度纺织工业的产量，比1955年同期还低1.3％。所以连美国的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志也说，“许多无偏见的经济学家……也认为美援加强了垄断资本，削弱了自由企业。”
    资本的进一步集中，中小企业的不断倒闭，加剧了意大利的失业和贫困现象。去年7月，雇有一万四千名工人的皮雷利橡胶公司，一次就解雇了一千名工人。目前，意大利有二百万失业和二百万半失业的工人。
    意大利接受“美援”，还使它沦为美国倾销剩余物资的市场。过去两年中间，美国拨给意大利几笔贷款，总数近二亿美元，就是作为购买美国剩余物资之用。通过这种贷款，美国的剩余物资源源地流入意大利市场，有许多是意大利本来不需要进口的商品，因而造成了意大利本身农业产品过剩的危机。
    美国使意大利实行“贸易自由”政策，让美国商品充斥意大利市场。但是美国自己却高筑关税壁垒，因此在美意贸易上造成意大利的巨大逆差。在执行“马歇尔计划”的四年中，意大利进口总值增加了71％，同时出口总值只增加了35％。1956年上半年意大利自美国进口总值为一千五百一十四亿里拉，而向美国出口的总值只有五百四十八亿里拉。同时，美国还多方限制和禁止意大利同社会主义阵营国家进行贸易，因而使得意大利和社会主义阵营国家间有利的贸易不断缩减。这使得意大利的对外贸易更少周转的余地。在西德、日本等国家的工业迅速地发展和资本主义世界市场竞争日益加剧的情况下，意大利对外贸易的困难就愈来愈大。
    为了加强对意大利经济的控制，美国在1951年9月又同意大利政府修订1948年所签订的“友好通商航海条约”，更给美国垄断资本渗入意大利经济开了一个方便之门。美国垄断资本家根据这个条约，在意大利可以有权购买或租赁任何工厂或土地、收购股票和享受专利权等。几年以来，美国利用这些特权已经控制了许多意大利的重要工业企业。例如，美国通用汽车公司就控制了意大利全部汽车工业生产的90％；杜邦公司控制了意大利全部化学工业产品的75％；意大利的石油工业几乎全为美国“海湾”和“美孚”两家石油公司所控制；85％的意大利石油加油站属于美国资本所有。
    意大利既使自己的经济依附于美国，所以在外交上也就屈从于美国的政策。几年来，意大利政府一直追随美国“冷战”政策，积极参加北大西洋公约集团的活动。作为意大利追随美国政策的直接后果之一，就是加在意大利人民肩上的沉重的军费负担。去年6月意大利下院通过1956—1957财政年度的军事预算为五千一百六十三亿里拉，比上一财政年度增加二百九十二亿里拉，差不多等于1948—1949财政年度的两倍。巨大军事开支和长期的贸易失调，造成了通货的不断膨胀。不断高涨的物价成为意大利劳动人民生活的经常威胁。据意大利中央统计局发表的材料说，去年一年内意大利的生活费用又上涨了4.1％。路透社在它的一条消息里说：战后罗马的贫民窟不断扩大，许多意大利居民住在罗马郊区外围的肮脏的小屋里、山洞里，甚至是古坟里。首都的情况如此，农村和其他地区就尤其如此。为了改善不堪忍受的生活条件，去年7月意大利三百万农业工人举行了四十八小时的总罢工。
    根据北大西洋公约的安排，许多美国军事基地在意大利修建起来。美国军方控制了一百多个意大利的空军基地。最近，美国的一种新式的“下士式”远程导弹已经运到意大利，供给美国南欧战术空军司令部装置在意大利北部的威钦萨战略地区。美国的第六舰队把意大利的里窝那、那不勒斯、巴勒摩、大兰多和布林迪西等港口作为基地。美国的军队在意大利还享有治外法权。美国军事上的这种部署，使意大利实际上处于美国军事占领之下，主权遭到破坏，并有被美国用来作为进行新战争的基地的危险。
    十年来，意大利政府屈从美国政策的结果证明，这不仅并不像意大利官方所吹嘘的那样，使意大利的国民经济真正复兴起来，而且使意大利的民族权利受到愈来愈多的损害。因此，有远见的意大利人士，他们为了维护本国的民族利益，不止一次地反对意大利政府屈从美国政策，要求实行独立自主的政策，改进同社会主义阵营国家的关系，扩大贸易，以改善意大利的境况，提高人民的生活。“米兰日报”表达了一部分商界人士的意见。它写道：“为了意大利商人的利益起见，我们并不要求外国的帮助和保护，我们只要求让他们在国际贸易中，像其他西方国家的商人一样，毫无阻碍地自由进行贸易。我们的政府对这个问题，必须以全面的实际观点来考虑。”随着“美援”和北大西洋政策恶果的日益明显和贸易情况的逐步恶化，这种不要“帮助和保护”而要“进行贸易的自由”的呼声，在意大利是愈来愈多了。
