Spring Ploughing Heatwave in Longxi County
By our reporter Lei Pu

The second spring ploughing production campaign since collectivization has been launched on both sides of the Jiulong River. After the Spring Festival, Longxi County, Fujian Province, has been given a new look, and the quiet early spring has become lively.

Last year, this area first won the glorious title of "Thousand Catty County," with an average grain yield of 1,179 catties per mu. If the grain produced that year were distributed evenly among all the farmers in the county, each person could receive 1,044 catties. This is a very considerable number, and it gave the more than 53,000 farming households the greatest encouragement and strength, allowing collectivization to withstand rigorous testing.

Spring has arrived, what are the people here planning to do? Recently, I visited this area and learned that farmers throughout the county are launching a "Ten Thousand Catty Household" production increase campaign. The ultimate goal of this campaign is to achieve an average household income of 10,000 catties of grain this year, including increases in grain, fruits, sideline occupations, and other cash crops, an increase of 558 catties per household compared to the average of 9,442 catties last year. If only grain is counted, the average yield per mu last year was 1,179 catties, and this year it will reach 1,225 catties, an increase of 46 catties over last year.

Everyone is Making New Calculations

How exactly will the farmers guarantee the realization of the production increase target based on this year's new conditions and characteristics? Initially, I also raised this question. After running along the Jiulong River, I was truly excited to see the farmers' enthusiasm for production. In Guxian, Yancuo, Jiuhu, and other townships, a "household-by-household, person-by-person accounting" campaign has already been launched. The Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Jiuhu Township has already formulated a larger and more comprehensive production increase plan than last year. According to this plan, the total income this year, including grain, fruits, beekeeping, and other economic activities, will be more than 1.65 million yuan. Each of the township's more than 1,800 households can receive more than 880 yuan, which is equivalent to an average of 12,000 catties of rice per household. In grain production alone, improving irrigation can increase production by 224,000 catties. The Guxian District Committee made a statistic that among the thirteen advanced cooperatives in the district, with more than 10,400 households, three cooperatives can achieve an average total income of 10,000 catties per household this year, six cooperatives can achieve 11,000 catties, three cooperatives can achieve 12,000 catties, and one cooperative can achieve 14,000 catties; the income of nine cooperatives can reach 1 million yuan, becoming the new "millionaire cooperatives" this year.

Some people asked, is the plan reliable? The answer is yes. It is said that this year the farmers have gained a basic experience called "plan first, then act," so it is said that this year is a stable production high tide. Last year, the scale of basic construction of agricultural cooperatives in Longxi County was unprecedented in history. Water conservancy construction has basically reached the point of eliminating drought, but the farmers reflected that some things that should not have been done were done, and things that should have been done later were done earlier. They compared this extravagant phenomenon to: "Building a big house without materials, marrying a daughter-in-law without a son"; in addition, the amount of land reclaimed was also very large, totaling more than 30,000 mu, which opened up new gardens for the development of fruit trees, but some were also reclaimed incorrectly, especially in places with more land and less labor, which has been felt to be uneconomical. Of course, it is inevitable that some shortcomings will arise in the absence of collective management experience. This year is different. From the county to the township and even the farmers, everyone believes that the plan should be formulated practically and reliably, taking local conditions into account, and achieving a standard that is both stable and active. Many agricultural cooperatives have also launched necessary debates for the implementation of certain plans. For example, Zheng Shilong, the captain of the fifth production team of the Guxian Agricultural Cooperative, made a suggestion to the cooperative, proposing to dig out the sludge from a large pond in the township to improve the soil. According to his estimate, the fertile soil accumulated in the pond is at least 80,000 to 90,000 dan, enough to improve the soil quality of 300 mu of land. However, his opinion was not adopted by the cooperative, because according to the cooperative director's estimate, only 30,000 dan can be dug out at most, fearing that it would be a waste of labor and uneconomical. Finally, after endless debate, the cooperative decided to invite some experienced old farmers to conduct on-site investigation. The result of the investigation was that Zheng Shilong's opinion was correct. Now the sludge has been cleared out, not 30,000 dan, but 100,000 dan. The reason why this year's production increase plan in Longxi County is said to be stable and reliable is also that it has followed the mass line, and the farmers have reflected that "this year we have a good understanding of our resources." Therefore, many farmers in many areas are planning for the cooperative on the one hand and planning for themselves on the other hand. Some people have also subscribed to attendance plans with the cooperative. Since the beginning of spring, the attendance rate of many cooperatives has reached more than 90%.

Strong Troops and Horses Welcome Spring Ploughing

Although there have been many new changes this year, a few people have not been able to see them. They said: "This year's spring ploughing is not as vigorous and enthusiastic as last year," as if the farmers' enthusiasm is not as great this year. This is not the case. On both sides of the Jiulong River, it has often been rainy since the beginning of spring, but the time for farmers to go to the fields has been half a month earlier than last year. By the end of February, the puddling of fields had all ended, and the fields were like a large ocean, reflecting the sky onto the ground. Recently, it is still drizzling every day, but it is indeed impossible to find idle people. I visited several cooperative members who were sowing early rice in the Guxian Agricultural Cooperative. They sowed exquisitely and neatly, which was rare in previous years. The seedlings were specially cultivated by experienced old farmers. Before sowing, square lines were drawn in the paddy fields, so that the sowing was both fast and good, and there was a standard, which fully reflects the in-depth and meticulous production this year. According to the analysis of the Guxian District Committee Secretary: "Vigorous and enthusiastic was last year, in-depth and meticulous, organized and rational is this year." Last year, the inner struggle of the farmers was "can production be increased?" This year's inner struggle is "how much production increase?"

In terms of production management, it can also be seen that there have been many changes this year. The Guxian Agricultural Cooperative summarized the shortcomings of last year's production management into several points, called: chaotic scoring, chaotic work assignment, chaotic work calculation, chaotic agricultural tools, and chaotic plans. Because of lack of experience, a maximum of 28 people were concentrated on one mu of land, and some teams repeated weeding three times in a rice field. This year, they have figured out a set of experiences, so that everything is managed by someone, everything is arranged, and labor efficiency has been greatly improved. Up to now, the amount of fertilizer accumulated has reached 250,000 dan, an increase of more than three times compared to 80,000 dan in the same period last year.

The most effective measures for Longxi County to improve the management of agricultural cooperatives are to implement branch management for cooperatives that are too large to lead; to universally implement a democratic management system, expand the scope of the production team's powers, and comprehensively implement the "three guarantees" system. Last year, most of the powers of the agricultural cooperatives were concentrated in the cooperatives, and the production teams had no initiative. The main root of the chaotic management was here. This year, after the agricultural cooperatives implemented the "three guarantees" and the delegation of powers, many new atmospheres have emerged. The working group of Yancuo Township told me that last year the township, including the party branch secretary and most of the cooperative cadres, were sitting in the office directing production, but this year they have all gone deep into the production teams to lead. With the initiative of the small teams, it is easier to discuss with the members. Last year, the members had this feeling, everyone thought that "collectivization has made us rich, but we are rich in a muddle (meaning we can't manage our own affairs)," now everything is discussed with the members, and our own interests and the interests of the cooperative are more closely combined.

In the Face of New Problems

However, to ensure that this year's agricultural production exceeds last year's level, that is, the county reaches the level of "10,000-catty households," it is still necessary to solve some problems. From the current point of view, the first major problem is insufficient funds and material preparation. According to the survey, many agricultural cooperatives have not yet raised the funds they should have. Due to the lax control of the system, more than 400 households out of more than 1,300 members of the Shengli Agricultural Cooperative in Yancuo Township have overdrawn cash, and the remaining members have strong opinions and are unwilling to invest in the cooperative. It is understood that problems like this are not only happening in individual cooperatives. Secondly, some areas lack a correct assessment of the improvement of farming systems and techniques last year. A few farmers, regardless of right and wrong, believe that any mention of improving technology is a mistake. For example, salt water seed selection is a good and effective experience that has been practiced for several years, but many areas have not done so this year; last year, appropriate close planting was promoted, and most areas significantly increased production. A few fell over due to unreasonable fertilization and inappropriate drainage timing. If we correctly summarize the experience this year, we can completely avoid the mistakes of last year. However, judging from the current situation, some areas have negated this way to increase production, and some farmers and cadres one-sidedly emphasized that "close planting requires a lot of work and is uneconomical."

Another problem is that after the cadres are delegated at all levels, there are two different understandings and different styles. Most cadres believe that this year's rural work is more in-depth and more meticulous. They have grasped the characteristics of this year, seized the urgent demands of the farmers, and boldly and deeply acted as consultants to the farmers. The masses said:

"This year, the cadres are working down-to-earth, and there is no more subjectivism." There are also some other cadres who are helpless in the face of this year's new situation, dare not work boldly and deeply, but complain that the farmers are "backward" and "conservative," saying that "the farmers have become rich this year." The farmers call these people "bureaucrats squeezed down from above." Many cadres only attach importance to the stable side of this year's production, while ignoring the active side, so there is a characteristic in the spring ploughing of some cooperatives, there is only the stable side, without the active side, especially the conservative thinking in the improvement of technology has not been criticized. It is believed that Longxi County will solve these problems in a timely manner.

### 龙溪县的春耕热潮

　　龙溪县的春耕热潮
　　本报记者　雷普
    九龙江两岸，已经掀起了合作化以后的第二个春耕生产运动。福建省龙溪县，在春节以后大地就换了新装，沉静的初春已变得热闹起来。
    去年这里第一次获得了“千斤县”的光荣称号，每亩田的平均粮食产量达到一千一百七十九斤，这一年所产的粮食如果按全县农户平均分配，每个人可以得到一千零四十四斤，这是一个非常可观的数字，它给了五万三千多户农民最大的鼓舞和力量，使合作化经过了严格的考验。
    春天来了，这里的人们又在做些什么打算呢？最近，我访问了这个地区，了解到全县农民正在开展一个“万斤户”的增产运动。这个运动的最终目的是要在今年一年，包括粮食、果类、副业和其他经济作物的增产在内，每户平均收入达到一万斤粮食，比去年每户平均九千四百四十二斤增加五百五十八斤；如果只计算粮食，去年是每亩平均产量一千一百七十九斤，今年将达到一千二百二十五斤，比去年提高四十六斤。
    人人都打新算盘
    究竟农民怎样依据今年新的条件和特点保证增产任务的实现呢？开始，我也是这样提出问题的。当我沿着九龙江跑了一趟以后，看到农民积极生产的劲头真使人兴奋。在古县、颜厝、九湖等乡，事实上早已开展了“户户、人人算账”运动，九湖乡先锋农业社已经制订了一个比去年规模更大、更全面的增产计划。根据这个计划，今年包括粮食、果类、养蜂等多种经济的总收入是一百六十五万多元，全乡一千八百多户，每户可以分到八百八十多元，折算成稻谷，每户平均达到一万二千斤。粮食生产中仅改良灌溉一项可以增产二十二万四千斤。古县区委作了一个统计，全区十三个高级社，一万零四百多户，今年每户平均总收入可以达到一万斤的三个社，一万一千斤的六个社，一万二千斤的三个社，一万四千斤的一个社；九个社的收入可以达到一百万元，成为今年新的“百万富翁社”。
    有人问，计划是否可靠呢？答复是肯定的。据说，今年农民得到一个基本经验，叫做“先打算后行动”，所以说今年是稳定的生产高潮。去年龙溪县农业社基本建设的规模是历史上从来未有过的，水利建设已经达到基本上消灭旱灾的程度，但是农民反映有些不该做的做了，该迟做的早做了，他们把这种铺张现象比做：“没料盖大厝（房子），无子讨媳妇”；另外，开荒的数量也很大，总数是三万多亩，这为发展果树开辟了新的园地，但是也有一部分开错了，特别是土地多、劳力少的地方已经感到不合算。当然，在没有集体经营经验的情况下产生一些缺点确是不可避免的。今年就不同了，从县到乡以至农民都认为计划应该订得切实可靠、因地制宜，做到既稳妥又积极的标准，有不少农业社还为执行某项计划展开了必要的争论。比如，古县农业社第五生产队队长郑狮笼向社里提出一项建议，他主张把乡里一个大池塘的污泥挖出来改良土壤。据他的估计，池塘里积蓄的肥土至少有八、九万担，足够改善三百亩土地的土质。但是他的意见没有被社里采纳，因为据社长的估计，最多只能挖三万担，怕白花劳力，不合算。最后争论不休，社里便决定请一些有经验的老农去实地调查。调查的结果，是郑狮笼的意见正确。现在污泥已经清理出来，不是三万担，而是十万担。今年龙溪县的增产打算所以说稳妥、可靠，也在于走了群众路线，农民们反映“今年摸了家底”。因此，很多地区的农民是一边打算社里的一边打算自己的，有的人还向社里订了出勤计划，入春以来很多社出勤率达到90％以上。
    兵强马壮迎春耕
    尽管今年有许多新的变化，却有少数人没有能够看得出来。他们说：“今年春耕不像去年轰轰烈烈，热火朝天”似乎今年农民劲头不大了。事实不是这样。在九龙江两岸，自入春以来，就常常处于阴雨状态，但是农民下田的时间却比去年提早半个月左右，到2月下旬，溶田已经全部结束，田野里像一大片海洋一样，把天空映到大地上来。最近，每天仍然洒着蒙蒙细雨，但确实找不到闲人。我在古县农业社访问了几个正在播种早稻的社员，他们播得精致、整齐是往年少见的，秧种是经过有经验的老农专门培育的，播种以前在稻田里划出方格式的线条，播得既快又好也有标准，充分反映了今年生产的深入细致。据古县区区委书记的分析：“轰轰烈烈、热火朝天是去年，深入细致、有条有理是今年”。去年农民内心的斗争是“能不能增产”，今年的内心斗争是“增产多少”。
    在管理生产方面也可以看出，今年有许多变化。古县农业社把去年管理生产的缺点总结成几条，叫做：评分乱、派工乱、计工乱、农具乱、计划乱。因为缺乏经验，一亩田最多集中过二十八个人劳动，有的小队在一块稻田里重复间苗三次。今年都摸出一套经验来，做得行行有人管，事事有安排，劳动效率提高了很多。到目前为止，肥料的积蓄量已经达到二十五万担，比去年同时期的八万担增加两倍以上。
    龙溪县改善农业社经营管理最有效的办法是社大不便于领导的实行分社经营；普遍推行民主管理制度、扩大生产队职权范围和全面推行“三包”制度等几种措施。去年大部分农业社的权力都集中在社里，生产队没有主动权，经营管理混乱的主要症结就在这里。今年农业社推行了“三包”和职权下放以后，已经出现了许多新的气象。颜厝乡工作组对我说，去年这个乡包括党支部书记和大部分社干部都坐在办公室里指挥生产，今年都深入到生产队里领导了。小队有了主动权，就便于和社员商谈，去年社员们有这种感觉，大家认为“合作化以后富了，但富得糊涂（意思是当不了家）”，现在事事都和社员商量，把自己和社的利害关系更紧紧结合在一处了。
      在新问题面前
    但是，要保证今年农业生产超过去年的水平，即全县达到“万斤户”的水平，还必须解决一些问题。从目前来看，首先一个主要问题是资金、物质准备不足。据调查，有很多农业社到现在为止还没有筹集好应有的资金，颜厝乡胜利农业社由于制度掌握不严，全社一千三百多户社员中有四百多户超支了现钱，其余的社员很有意见，不愿意向社里投资。据了解，像这类问题还不只发生在个别社里。其次是部分地区对去年改进耕作制度和技术缺乏正确的估价，少数农民不分是非，凡提起改进技术就认为是错误，如盐水选种是几年来行之有效的好经验，今年很多地区没有这样做；去年推行适当密植，绝大部分地区显著增产了，少数由于施肥不合理、排水时机不适当而发生了倒伏，今年如果正确的总结经验，是完全可以避免去年的错误的，可是从现在的情况看，有些地区否定了这条增产门路，有些农民和干部则片面强调“密植花工大，不合算”。
    还有一个问题是干部层层下放后，存在着两种不同认识和不同作风，大部分干部认为今年农村工作更深入更细致，他们掌握了今年的特点，抓住农民迫切要求，大胆、深入的去作农民的顾问。群众说：
  “今年干部脚踏实地工作，没有主观主义了。还有另外一些干部，他们面对今年的新情况束手无策，不敢大胆和深入的工作，却埋怨农民“落后”、“保守”，说“农民今年发了”。农民称这些人为“从上面挤下来的官僚主义”。不少干部只重视今年生产中稳妥的一面，而忽视积极的一面，所以某些社春耕中有个特点，只有稳妥的一面，没有积极的一面，特别是在改进技术上的保守思想没有受到批判。相信龙溪县会及时解决这些问题的。
