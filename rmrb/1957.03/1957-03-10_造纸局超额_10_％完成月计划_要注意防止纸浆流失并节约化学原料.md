　　(Reported by this newspaper) With the deepening of the movement for increased production and economy, enterprises under the Paper Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry continued their efforts in February to overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials and improved production in various aspects, overfulfilling the state plan.

　　Many factories devised many methods to improve production. Some factories tried to shorten the cooking time; some factories improved the pulping capacity; some factories reduced pulp consumption; some factories appropriately increased paper machine speed; and some factories with unbalanced equipment adopted mutual cooperation methods to ensure increased production.

　　Thanks to the efforts of the workers in various factories, the bureau increased pulp production by 3,528 tons in February, exceeding the original plan by 10.03%; paper and cardboard production increased by 3,288 tons, exceeding the original plan by 10.01%.

　　Currently, some factories still have some problems in increasing production and practicing economy. The first thing that deserves the attention of all factories is how to reduce pulp loss. The pulp loss in each factory is generally high, the most serious being the Guangzhou Factory, which loses about 20 tons of pulp every day, almost equal to the planned pulp production of the Beijing Paper Mill in February.

　　Secondly, some factories do not pay enough attention to the conservation of chemical raw materials. At present, the most scarce chemical raw material is alkali. Saving one ton of alkali can increase pulp production by three tons. The bureau uses 30,000 tons of alkali throughout the year. If 5% can be saved, it can give local paper industry a lot of help. For example, the Shenyang Factory uses waste alkali from the machinery industry to produce, which can save two to three tons of good alkali every month. This method can be promoted in areas where conditions permit.

　　The issue of safe production should also be given universal attention by all factories. In February, both mechanical accidents and personal accidents occurred. For example, the Tianjin Paper Mill had to shut down twice due to motor fires, which affected the normal progress of production.

### 造纸局超额10％完成月计划  要注意防止纸浆流失并节约化学原料

    造纸局超额10％完成月计划
    要注意防止纸浆流失并节约化学原料
    本报讯　随着增产节约运动的深入开展，轻工业部造纸工业管理局所属企业在2月份，继续努力克服了原材料不足的困难，并且从各方面改进生产，超额完成了国家计划。
    许多厂在改进生产方面想了许多办法，有的厂设法缩短了蒸煮时间；有的厂提高了造浆能力；有的厂减少了浆的消耗；有的厂适当提高了抄速；有些设备不平衡的厂，采取互相协作的办法，保证了增产。
    由于各厂职工的努力，2月份全局增产了纸浆三千五百二十八吨，超过原计划10.03％；纸和纸板三千二百八十八吨，超过原计划10.01％。
    目前，有些工厂在增产节约上还存在一些问题，首先值得各厂注意的是如何减少纸浆流失的问题。各厂浆的流失一般都比较多，最严重的如广州厂每天流失的浆竟达二十吨左右，几乎等于北京造纸厂2月份计划产浆量。
    其次有些厂对化学原料的节约还不够重视。目前化学原料中最不足的是碱，节约一吨碱，就可以增产三吨浆。全局全年用碱三万吨，如果能够节约百分之五，就可以给地方造纸工业不小的帮助。如沈阳厂利用机械工业部门的废碱来生产，每月能节约好碱两、三吨。这个办法，在有条件的地区是可以推广的。
    还有安全生产的问题，也还要引起各厂的普遍重视，在2月份，机械事故、人身事故都发生过。如天津造纸厂就因马达冒火曾经停机两次，影响了生产的正常进行。
