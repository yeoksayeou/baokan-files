Actively Participate in Social Savings

Mass social savings are an important aspect of the current increase production and practice economy movement in our country. The development of savings undertakings has a significant positive effect on accumulating funds for socialist construction and further stabilizing market prices. Therefore, we must attach great importance to social savings. According to statistics, as of February 10 this year, the total amount of deposits absorbed by state banks was 2,178 million yuan. This amount of deposits can be used to buy 210,000 15-horsepower tractors; to build 4,670 kilometers of railways; to build 58 cotton textile factories with 90,000 spindles each, or 140 automatic thermal power plants with 12,000 kilowatts each; or for cultural, educational, and health undertakings, it can build 3,360 general hospitals with 100 beds each, or 11,000 ordinary middle schools with 900 students each. The enormous role of social savings is evident from this.

Social savings are not only beneficial to the country's construction, but also of great benefit to the savers themselves. Regularly participating in savings can cultivate thrifty habits, rationally arrange one's economic life, and avoid difficulties in the event of unexpected events; it can also accumulate small amounts into large sums for certain important uses for families and individuals. In a street in Tianjin, many families save five cents per household every day and voluntarily entrust the residents' committee to collect them and deposit them in the bank. By the time of the New Year, each household had accumulated eighteen yuan in the bank, and as a result, everyone had a good New Year, unlike in previous years when they could not even afford to buy meat. The nurses at the Children's Hospital in Dalian needed watches for their work, but they could never afford them in the past. Since 1954, everyone has participated in social savings and persisted for more than two years. Now nine nurses have bought watches. These examples vividly illustrate the benefits of participating in social savings.

The development of social savings undertakings now has better conditions than at any time in the past. Because in terms of the current economic income and living standards of the people in our country, participating in social savings is already something that the vast majority of workers, cadres, and ordinary working people can do regularly, given a rational plan for household and personal expenses. There is an ordinary worker's family in the Xi'an Textile Factory, with a total of five people in the family. The regular monthly income is 54 yuan. The housewife, Ma Yueping, is able to calculate carefully and rationally plan her expenses. She spends 30 yuan on food each month, 3.93 yuan on rent, 5.8 yuan on oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and coal, 3.8 yuan on vegetables, 5.5 yuan on stationery, books, newspapers, and entertainment for the children's schooling, and 2 yuan on mutual aid funds. The remaining 2.97 yuan is used for haircuts and other miscellaneous expenses. In addition, she sometimes earns a few yuan a month washing clothes for workers to supplement her household income. In this way, she also participates in social savings, and she does it very regularly. After receiving her salary each month, she only buys some of the things that are urgently needed first, and the money that is not needed for the time being is placed in the bank as a current deposit, which she can withdraw later as needed. In addition, she also insists on saving one yuan a month in zero-deposit lump-sum savings with prizes. There are many worker families like this, and it is entirely possible to mobilize them to participate in social savings.

According to a survey of the income and expenditure of about 6,000 industrial worker families in 27 large and medium-sized cities by the State Statistical Bureau, many ordinary workers in our country currently have higher incomes and lighter burdens than Ma Yueping's family. Many workers have a lot of cash on hand each month: at the end of June 1956, the average cash on hand per household was 12.24 yuan, and by the end of September it had increased to 23.07 yuan. This means that their savings potential is not small. As for senior intellectuals, senior state officials, technicians, and military officers, their savings potential is even greater.

However, there are still many people who are unwilling to actively participate in social savings for various reasons. Some people believe that the state now implements labor insurance for workers, and the welfare undertakings of work units are also doing very well. Their lives are fully guaranteed, and they will only get better year by year in the future. Therefore, they believe that saving money is useless. Disregarding their own economic conditions, they only rely on temporary interests to purchase various non-essential high-end consumer goods, and sometimes they even incur a large amount of debt. Some of these people reach out to the public for subsidies.

The state implements labor insurance in order to ensure that workers do not encounter major difficulties in their lives in the event of unexpected events, and at the same time encourage workers' production enthusiasm and creativity. Agencies, organizations, and enterprises should continue to run welfare undertakings for workers in the future, as long as they are reasonable and possible. However, what attitude should people take towards the labor insurance and welfare undertakings implemented by the state? Should they try to solve personal life problems with their own economic strength as much as possible, save expenses for the state, and reduce the burden? Or should they blindly rely on labor insurance and welfare for everything, and try to increase expenses and burdens for the state? This is something that every conscious citizen should think deeply about.

Some people say that although saving is good, the money will be used up before the end of the month, and the amount is small, which is not of much benefit to the country. Why bother? In fact, it is not the case. The People's Bank has calculated such an account: if a person saves 30 yuan at the beginning of the month and withdraws one yuan for pocket money every day, and withdraws it all in 30 days, then his average deposit in the bank every day is 15.5 yuan, and the state can invest this money in construction. According to the Dongdan District Savings Office in Beijing, if all 60,000 workers in the district do this every month, the bank can collect 930,000 yuan every day. Isn't this considerable? Therefore, we believe that no family or individual should underestimate the small amount of each savings. Any large amount is made up of small amounts. Accumulating many small amounts into large amounts can do many things. How regrettable it is if it is left unused in personal pockets or wasted!

There are also some people who are unwilling to participate in social savings because they do not want others to know their economic situation. This is of course an unnecessary concern. Because the bank can be responsible for keeping the secrets of any depositor. In the past, there were indeed some units that, because someone had a few yuan in the bank, thought that the person was economically well-off without analysis, and did not help him when he really needed it. This situation should be changed. In the future, public subsidies to individuals should mainly depend on whether the person concerned really has insurmountable difficulties, and should not be ignored simply because he has a few yuan in the bank.

### 积极参加社会储蓄

    积极参加社会储蓄
    群众性的社会储蓄，是我国目前增产节约运动的一个重要方面。储蓄事业的发展，对于聚积社会主义建设的资金以及进一步稳定市场物价，都有很大的积极作用。因此，我们必须十分重视社会储蓄。据统计，到今年2月10日为止，国家银行吸收存款的总额是二十一亿七千八百万元。这项存款用来购买十五匹马力的拖拉机，可买二十一万台；用于修建铁路，可修四千六百七十公里；用于兴建工厂，可以兴建九万枚纱锭的棉纺织厂五十八个，或者建设一万二千瓩的自动火力发电站一百四十处；用于文教卫生事业，可以兴建一百个床位的综合性医院三千三百六十处，或者可容九百名学生的普通中学一万一千处。社会储蓄的巨大作用，于此可见。
    社会储蓄不仅是对国家建设事业有利，而且对储蓄者自己也有巨大好处。经常参加储蓄，可以养成俭朴的习惯，合理地安排自己的经济生活，不致在遇到意外事情的时候发生困难；还可以聚零为整，用于家庭和个人的某些重要的用途。天津有一条街道，很多人家每户每天节约五分钱，自愿委托居民委员集中起来存入银行。到过年的时候，每户都在银行积了十八元，结果大家过年都过得很好，不像以前过年的时候那样连肉也不能买。旅大市儿童医院的护士们工作上需要手表，过去老是买不起。从1954年起，大家参加了社会储蓄，坚持了两年多的时间，现在有九个护士都已经买上了手表。这些例子生动地说明了参加社会储蓄的好处。
    社会储蓄事业的发展，现在比过去任何时候都有更好的条件。因为就当前我国人民的经济收入和生活水平来说，在合理地计划家庭和个人开支的情况下，参加社会储蓄已经是广大职工、干部和一般劳动人民经常能够做得到的事情了。西安纺织厂有一个普通工人家庭，全家五口人，每月的经常收入是五十四元。主妇马月平能够精打细算，合理计划开支，每月买粮食用三十元，房租用三元九角三分，油盐酱醋和煤炭共用五元八角，菜蔬用三元八角，孩子上学用的文具、书报和娱乐费共五元五角，交互助金二元，剩下的二元九角七分作为理发和其它零星费用。另外，有时候她给职工洗衣服，每月还可以收入几块钱补贴家用。这样，她也参加了社会储蓄，而且做得很经常。每月发工资以后，她只是先买急需的一部分东西，暂时不用的钱就放在银行作活期存款，以后随用随取。另外，她还坚持每月存一元钱的零存整取的有奖储蓄。像这样情况的职工家庭很多，普遍动员他们参加社会储蓄是完全可能的。
    根据国家统计局在二十七个大中城市中对六千户左右工业职工家庭收支的调查，目前我国一般职工比马月平的家庭收入多、负担轻的还很多。许多职工每月手存现金是不少的：1956年6月底，每户平均手存现金十二元二角四分，9月底增加到二十三元零七分。这就是说，他们的储蓄潜力很不小。至于高级知识分子、高级国家工作人员、技术人员和部队军官等，他们的储蓄潜力就更大了。
    但是，目前还有许多人因为各种原因不愿意积极参加社会储蓄。有的认为现在国家对职工实行劳动保险，工作单位的福利事业也搞得挺好，生活完全有保障，而且将来只会一年比一年过得更好，因此就认为储蓄了钱也没有用处。他们不顾自己的经济条件，只凭一时的兴趣，购买各种并非必需的高级消费品，有时还拖欠下一大笔债务，其中有一些人就伸手向公家要求补助。
    国家实行劳动保险，是为了保证职工在生活上遇到意外事情的时候不致发生重大困难，同时鼓励职工的生产积极性和创造性。机关、团体和企业为职工举办福利事业，只要是合理的，可能的，今后也还是应该举办。但是，人们应该用什么态度来对待国家所实行的劳动保险和福利事业呢？是尽可能地用自己的经济力量解决个人生活上的问题，给国家节省开支、减轻负担呢？还是什么事都一味依赖劳保福利，尽量给国家增加开支、增加负担呢？这是每一个有觉悟的公民都应该深思的。
    有些人说，储蓄虽然好，但有钱存不到月底就要取光，数目又小，对国家没多大好处，何必找麻烦呢？其实不然。人民银行算了这样一笔账：如果一个人月初储蓄三十元，每天取一元零用，三十天取完，这样，他每天在银行的存款平均就有十五元五角，国家就可以把这笔钱投入建设。据北京东单区储蓄所计算，如果全区六万职工每人每月都这样做，银行每天就可以集中九十三万元。这不是很可观的吗？所以我们认为，任何家庭和个人都不应当因为每次储蓄的数目小就不加重视。任何大的数目，都是由小的数目积成的。积累许多小数目变成大数目，就可以办许多事情。如果放在个人口袋里不用，或者浪费了，这是多么可惜！
    也有一些人不愿意参加社会储蓄，是因为不愿意让别人知道自己的经济状况。这当然是不必要的顾虑。因为银行可以负责为任何储户保密。过去也确有一些单位，因为某人在银行里存了几元钱，就不加分析地认为这人经济宽裕，在他真正需要帮助的时候也不予帮助。这种情形应当改变。今后公家对个人的补助，主要应当看当事人究竟是否真正有解决不了的困难，而不应当仅仅因为他在银行存了几元钱就不加过问。
