    An Adorer of Nature and People
    Li Wenjun
    The American painter Rockwell Kent loved to travel and sketch. He painted the ice-covered islands of Greenland, the breathtaking icebergs of Alaska, the rocks on Monhegan Island that have been washed by raging waves for years, the peaceful and tranquil meadows and marshes of Ireland, the rugged and jagged coasts of Newfoundland, and the lonely and desolate islands of Tierra del Fuego in South America. Kent said, "My heart beats only in the wilderness. It feels constrained in the city."
    Kent loved to paint ice, snow, mountains, and the sea. His paintings have clear outlines, and the contrast between light and shadow is extremely strong, and the colors seem extreme. I saw a painting called "North": a steep mountain stands on a snowfield, the arctic night sky is bright blue, snow covers the mountain, but the shady parts of the mountain are also blue, and the rest are white; yellow stars twinkle in the sky, there is no moon in the picture, but we can clearly see the moonlight flowing through the clear and clean cold sky, pouring down on the earth. At the foot of the mountain, a small sleigh is moving slowly. Such a painting makes me feel cold and solemn, but at the same time, I can't help but feel pure, peaceful, and uplifting.
    Another painting is called "Spring Fever." The background is a wilderness, but the clouds in the sky are filled with bright sunshine. A white horse and a black horse, which occupy a small place in the picture, leap lightly into the river, which makes people feel full of life. Kent is intoxicated with the beauty of the open and rugged wilderness.
    Kent also loves to paint people. The people in his paintings are all strong and have not been corrupted by capitalism. They often live in the wild and have a close connection with nature. Their strength is great, and their souls are pure. In the picture, their postures are also exceptionally beautiful, as if taken from a dance. What he reveals in his paintings is a lofty emotion of praising life and worshiping the power of man. He calls himself a realist, but in our opinion, his paintings have a strong romantic color.
    We cannot ignore that Kent is also an outstanding illustrator. He has illustrated many works, such as: English writer Chaucer's "The Canterbury Tales," American writer Herman Melville's "Moby Dick," French writer Voltaire's "Candide," and Italian writer Boccaccio's "The Decameron." Among Kent's paintings, my personal favorite is these illustrations. I hope that someone will select and print these illustrations together with his other paintings for enthusiasts to admire and learn from.
    Kent was born in 1882 and is now seventy-four years old. Since his twenties, he has been a supporter of socialism. He said: "I have worked with countless people to resist the wheels of 'democracy,' pushed it out of the quagmire, and put it back on the road. I still support and participate in every movement towards democracy that I notice." He participated in the movement to rescue Sacco and Vanzetti and initiated the anti-fascist "Artists Congress." During World War II, he advocated using art to cooperate with the anti-fascist struggle. Currently, he stands at the forefront of the struggle for peace and democracy in the United States, and his brush participates in this solemn struggle. He painted such a painting: an abandoned military helmet became a nest for a gentle and docile little bird. Isn't this exactly the hope of millions of ordinary Americans! Another painting is called "A Bright Future Rises Above a Dark Past," and the magnificent Moscow University on Lenin Hills appears in the picture. He also paints union logos for progressive unions. On the pattern of the airmail letter he designed, what is flying is not a "Sabre" fighter plane, but a dove of peace. Doves may be the painter's favorite animal in recent years.
    However, precisely because of this, the US government has tried every means to persecute him. Since 1951, they have maliciously refused to issue him a passport, attempting to deprive him of his painter's natural right to travel abroad and sketch. Kent has been fighting bravely to win back this right. His reason is very simple: "Our world is a lovely world, and art can help us understand this world." Perhaps Kent will one day come to China to sketch, to help Americans (and at the same time, isn't it helping the Chinese?) understand China! (Attached pictures)

    自然和人的赞美者

    美国画家洛克威尔·肯特最喜欢旅行写生。他画过格陵兰冰封的海岛，阿拉斯加惊心动魄的冰山，莫罕根岛上长年经受惊涛冲洗的岩石，爱尔兰平和宁静的草地和沼泽，纽芬兰险恶嶙峋的海岸和南美洲德拉·台·富加孤单寂寞的岛屿。肯特说过：“我的心在野外才会跳动。一到闹市，它就拘束起来了。”
    肯特最爱画冰、雪、山、海。他的画轮廓很明显，光与影的对比极为强烈，用色似乎也很极端。我看到一幅叫“北方”的画：在雪原上一座陡峭的山耸立着，寒带的夜空蓝得发亮，白雪复盖着山，但山的阴处也是蓝的，其余的地方才是白的；天空中黄色的繁星在眨眼，画面上没有月亮，但我们却分明看见月光流过清澈洁净的寒空，倾泻在大地上。山脚下，一辆小小的雪橇在缓缓地前进。这样的一幅画使我感到寒冷与肃穆，但同时，也不由得感到纯洁、宁静与振奋。
    另外有一幅画，叫“春情”。背景是一片荒原，但空中云层上泛着明亮的阳光，在画面上地位很小的一只白马和一只黑马轻盈地跃入河中，看后使人感到生意盎然。肯特是沉醉于开阔而粗犷的野外之美中的。
    肯特也爱画人。他笔下的人都很强壮，是未曾受到资本主义败坏的人。他们往往生活在野外，与自然有着密切的联系。他们的力量是强大的，灵魂是纯洁的。在画面上，他们的姿态也异常优美，像是从舞蹈中撷取出来似的。他画中所流露的是赞美生活膜拜人的力量的崇高的感情。他自称是现实主义者，但是在我们看来他的画却有着一重浓厚的浪漫主义的色彩。
    我们也不能忽略肯特同时也是一位杰出的插画家。他替许多作品作过插画，如：英国作家乔叟的“坎特伯雷故事”，美国作家赫门·梅尔维尔的“捕鲸记”，法国作家服尔德的“老实人”和意大利作家蒲伽丘的“十日谈”。在肯特的画中，我个人最喜欢的是这些插画，我希望能有一位有心人把这些插画连同他别的画一起选印出来供爱好者观摩学习。
    肯特生于1882年，现在已经七十四岁了。从二十几岁起他就是一个社会主义的拥护者。他说：“我曾与无数人一起顶住‘民主’的车轮，把它推出泥淖，使它重新走上路。我现在仍然赞助和参加每一个我所注意到的通向民主的运动。”他参加过营救萨柯和樊塞蒂的运动，发起过反法西斯的“艺术家大会”。在第二次世界大战中，他鼓吹用艺术来配合反法西斯的斗争。目前，他站在美国争取和平争取民主的斗争的前列，他的画笔参加了这个庄严的斗争。他画了这样的一幅画：被废弃的军盔成了一只温柔依人的小鸟的窝儿。这岂不正是千百万普通美国人的希望！另外有一幅画叫“光明的未来升起在黑暗的过去上”，画面上出现了列宁山上光辉灿烂的莫斯科大学。他还给进步工会画工会标志。在他所设计的航空信的图案上，飞翔的不是什么“佩刀式”飞机，而是和平鸽。鸽子也许是画家近年来最爱画的动物了。
    可是，正因为这样，美国政府千方百计地迫害他。从1951年起还恶毒地不发给他护照，企图剥夺他出国旅行写生这一种画家天赋的权利。肯特一直英勇地斗争着，要把这种权利夺回来。他的理由很简单：“我们的世界是一个可爱的世界，艺术能够帮助我们了解这个世界。”也许肯特有一天能来中国写生，以帮助美国人（难道同时不也是帮助中国人？）了解中国！（附图片）
