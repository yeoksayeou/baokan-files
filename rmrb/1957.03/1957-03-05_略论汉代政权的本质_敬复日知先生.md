A Brief Discussion on the Essence of the Han Dynasty Regime
—A Respectful Reply to Mr. Rizhi—
Guo Moruo

Editor's Note Since our newspaper published Mr. Guo Moruo's article "The Han Dynasty Regime Severely Cracking Down on Slave Owners," we have received some submissions expressing different opinions. On February 25th, we published Mr. Rizhi's article "From the Tradition of Emphasizing Agriculture and Suppressing Commerce to the Essence of the Han Dynasty Regime," which was one of them. Today, we are publishing Mr. Guo Moruo's reply. This issue still needs further exploration. However, due to the limited space of this newspaper, we do not intend to continue the discussion.

I. There is a Difference Between "Emphasizing Agriculture and Suppressing Commerce" and "Emphasizing Agriculture and Devaluing Commerce"

I carefully read Mr. Rizhi's article "From the Tradition of Emphasizing Agriculture and Suppressing Commerce to the Essence of the Han Dynasty Regime." Thank you for answering the questions I raised. But unfortunately, his answer does not seem to solve the problem.

Mr. Rizhi said: "The tradition of emphasizing agriculture and suppressing commerce was originally a product of a certain stage of development of the slave system and is an inherent phenomenon of slave society." Here, one word needs to be changed, and that is to change "emphasizing agriculture and suppressing commerce" to "emphasizing agriculture and devaluing commerce," then there will be no problem. "Emphasizing agriculture and suppressing commerce" is a policy, and "emphasizing agriculture and devaluing commerce" is a custom. The two should not be confused. If confused, there is a risk of "a hair's breadth difference leading to a thousand miles of error."

Ancient agricultural countries generally have the custom of emphasizing agriculture and devaluing commerce, but countries like Phoenicia, which established themselves through commerce, should be an exception. China is an agricultural country, so ancient China also had the custom of emphasizing agriculture and devaluing commerce. For example, in the ritual system of the Western Zhou Dynasty, the emperor had to personally plow the Jietian (the field for offering sacrifices), while the officials could not interfere in commercial affairs. In ancient times, people engaged in crafts and brokerage were slaves of the government, and nobles could not interfere in lowly affairs. But ancient emphasis on agriculture did not equate to equal emphasis on farmers. Among farmers were free citizens, and even more unfree slaves. Therefore, in Chinese philology, "nong" (agriculture) and "nu" (slave) are transformations of the same sound, and "nou" (hoe) and "ru" (humiliation) are transformations of the same meaning.

However, history is progressing. At the end of the Western Zhou Dynasty, King Li of Zhou had already begun to favor profit, and King Xuan of Zhou had already begun not to use the Qianmu (thousand acres) field. Despite the poets' ridicule of "If merchants gain threefold profits, gentlemen will recognize them" (Daya·Zhanang), the gentlemen (aristocratic groups) of the time had already begun to pay attention to profitable affairs.

After the eastward migration, even more drastic changes occurred. The new Zheng state was established by an alliance of merchant groups and aristocratic groups (Zuo Zhuan, Zhao Gong, Sixteenth Year). Guan Zhong, as the prime minister of Qi, valued weights and measures, carefully managed weights and balances, and controlled the mountains and seas (i.e., controlled salt and iron). He established the country through commerce and became the leader of the Five Hegemons. The famous merchant Xian Gao, after saving the Zheng state from danger, moved far away and refused to accept titles and emoluments (the story is detailed in Huainanzi·Renjianxun). Yue Daifu Fan Li even abandoned his lofty position and changed his name to engage in commerce, sailing through the Three Rivers and traveling the Five Lakes, becoming Tao Zhugong (a legendary wealthy businessman). Confucius's major disciple Zigong also "did not accept orders but engaged in trade" ("did not accept orders" means not becoming an official), and was able to rival the contemporary feudal lords. Confucius's travel expenses when he traveled around the countries may have been funded by this great disciple. Lu Buwei, a jewelry merchant from Luoyang, even became the prime minister of the Qin state, assisting Emperor Qin Shi Huang in laying the foundation for the unification of China, which can be said to be the pinnacle.

By the Warring States period in the development of ancient Chinese society, industry and commerce had been liberated, and the merchant class had greatly risen. Everyone in the world knew: "To seek wealth from poverty, farming is not as good as craftsmanship, and craftsmanship is not as good as commerce; embroidering is not as good as leaning against the market gate." (Records of the Grand Historian·Biographies of Money-Makers, cited as a proverb in the Book of Han, generally a proverb needs to be brewed for a long time.) Therefore, at that time, it was basically "a state with ten thousand chariots has merchants with ten thousand gold, and a state with a thousand chariots has merchants with a thousand gold" (Guanzi·Guoxu), and it even reached the point of "one country with two rulers and two kings." People like Lord Mengchang were famous usurers, which cannot be compared to "the free farmers in the Code of Hammurabi were full citizens (while the merchant usurers—Damkar, were not full citizens)."

Therefore, the "ancient" that Marx mentioned in "Forms Preceding Capitalist Production" is suitable for the Western Zhou Dynasty. "The ancients unanimously believed that agriculture was the only career suitable for free people and was a school for training soldiers." In China, this is called "mingling soldiers with farming." Marx's judgment is correct, but if Mr. Rizhi applies it to the Han Dynasty, it becomes problematic. It is not that the standard is problematic, but that the application of the standard is problematic.

China is a continental agricultural country. Especially after the twelve feudal lords of the Spring and Autumn period were merged into the seven heroes of the Warring States period, and finally achieved unification through the advocacy of great unity, the regime based on agriculture could not allow the abnormal development of commerce, especially illegal merchants arbitrarily merging farmers, making farmers impoverished, and endangering the foundation of the country. This led to the proposition of "emphasizing agriculture and suppressing commerce" by most schools of thought in the Zhou and Qin dynasties—consciously suppressing the abnormal development of commerce, rather than simply looking down on merchants, and further forming the "emphasizing agriculture and suppressing commerce" policy of the Qin and Han dynasties. The spirit of this policy was, in fact, to consolidate the regime of the landlord class.

II. Tenancy is the Universal Mode of Agricultural Production in the Han Dynasty

The regime of the Chinese landlord class had gradually formed since the late Spring and Autumn period. By the Qin and Han dynasties, the landlord economy had become a universal form. Regarding this point, a passage by Dong Zhongshu recorded in the Book of Han·Treatise on Food and Money is very detailed and comprehensive. I might as well quote it here again:

"The Qin... used the laws of Shang Yang, changed the system of emperors and kings, abolished the well-field system, and the people were allowed to buy and sell land. The rich had fields connected by thousands of acres, while the poor had no place to stand. (The rich) also monopolized the benefits of rivers and lakes, controlled the abundance of mountains and forests, indulged in extravagance beyond the rules, and surpassed each other in extravagance. The towns had the dignity of rulers, and the villages had the wealth of dukes and marquises. How could the common people not be impoverished? In addition, they were conscripted as soldiers every month, and after being discharged, they served as regular soldiers for one year and garrisoned for one year. Their labor was thirty times greater than in ancient times. Land rent, head tax, and the profits of salt and iron were twenty times greater than in ancient times. Some cultivated the fields of wealthy people and paid fifteen out of every hundred in taxes.

Therefore, the poor often wore the clothes of cattle and horses and ate the food of dogs and pigs...

The Han Dynasty followed this without change."

Here, the landlords and peasants had become severely opposed, and "land rent and head tax" were already prevalent, completely a feudal system.

But Mr. Rizhi paid special attention to the word "or" in this passage. He believes that "the word 'or' indicates that this method is not a universal phenomenon." Making such a major judgment based on just one word is a bit too early. I would like to ask Mr. Rizhi to also pay attention to this section in "Han Feizi·Guishen Pian":

"Collecting all taxes and monopolizing the power of the people is to prepare for disasters and fill the granaries. However, soldiers who escape military service hide and attach themselves to powerful families to avoid corvee labor and taxes, and those who are not captured by the authorities number in the tens of thousands."

"Guishen Pian" is Han Fei's late work, and what is stated should be the situation in the Qin Dynasty. If it was earlier, then it would be even less of a problem. This is consistent with Dong Zhongshu's words. The only difference is that Han Fei agrees, while Dong Zhongshu opposes. And the "or" that Dong Zhongshu mentioned here is "tens of thousands." "Tens of thousands" means calculated in units of ten thousand. Also, "tens of thousands" may mean countless. Ancient people used ten thousand as a "full number" and often used ten thousand to express a great many. Therefore, there are terms such as "ten thousand years," "ten thousand existences," "ten thousand sounds," "ten thousand things," "ten thousand people," "ten thousand states," and "ten thousand chariots." May I ask: Is it universal, or not universal?

Speaking of the Han Dynasty, which "followed this without change,"

I will now cite an example that Mr. Rizhi also values and elaborate on it.

"Hou Zhang (commander of the beacon tower)·Ludeguangchangli·Gongcheng Lizhong, age thirty: two small slaves, worth 30,000; one big maid, 20,000; five horses, 20,000; two oxen, 6,000; two ox carts, 4,000; one light carriage, worth 10,000; one house, worth 10,000; five qing of land, 50,000; total 150,000." ("Juyan Han Jian Kao Shi" III·48)

Mr. Rizhi believes that "this is a medium-sized or above farmer economy, with slave exploitation. These slaves are an auxiliary force for production and are related to production." He also quoted the later generations' saying "Ask the slave about farming, ask the maid about weaving" [Note] to support his argument. I guess Mr. Rizhi's meaning is probably that the "five qing of land" was cultivated by those "two small slaves." However, "five qing of land" is five hundred mu of land and will not be completely concentrated near the residence. May I ask how can two "small slaves" cultivate such a large area? Even if the "big maid" helps with cultivation, it is impossible. What's more, the "Hou Zhang" has many chores to do at home, the master has to be served, the house has to be cleaned, the livestock have to be fed, and the vehicles have to be taken care of; how can the three slaves, big and small, take care of production matters? Therefore, it is incorrect to think that these slaves are "related to production." Then, who cultivates the Hou Zhang's five hundred mu of land for him? The Hou Zhang himself will not cultivate, nor can he cultivate. From this, it can be seen that this first-hand historical material, the Han Jian (bamboo slip), is excellent historical data, proving that in the late Western Han Dynasty, even in the border areas like Juyan, agricultural production had already been established on the basis of tenancy.

This is a small example found in the border areas. I can also cite a large example from a non-border area.

"King Kang of Jinan, named An... accumulated much wealth and built grand palaces. He had as many as 1,400 slaves and 1,200 horses in his stables, and 800 qing of private land... The state Fu (tutor) He Chang memorialized Kang, saying... Now slaves and stable horses are all over a thousand, increasing the useless mouths." (Book of the Later Han·Biographies of the Ten Kings of Guangwu)

This is in Jinan. These 1,400 slaves of the King of Jinan were "useless mouths," indicating that he did not use them to "accumulate wealth" or to cultivate the land. The 1,200 stable horses were also "useless mouths," indicating that they were not used to cultivate the land either. Then we must ask: Who cultivates his 800 qing of private land (80,000 mu)? Doesn't this also show that there is a widespread tenancy relationship?

We do not deny that tenancy or employment can also exist under slavery, but that is only an embryonic state. But in the two examples cited here, tenancy relationships, i.e., landlord-peasant relationships, have been established in places as remote as Juyan and on land as vast as 800 qing. Can it be said that the Han Dynasty was still a slave system? Can it be said that this relationship is still in its embryonic stage and is being "exaggerated" by us?

The problem is obviously not being "exaggerated," but being "underestimated." To regard the Han Dynasty as a slave system is to underestimate the Han Dynasty culture too much. Not only is the production relationship untenable, but the nature of the regime is untenable, and the entire social foundation and superstructure are untenable.

III. The Han Dynasty Regime Protects Landlords and Attacks Merchant Slave Owners

In order to prove that the Han Dynasty was a slave system, Mr. Rizhi also wanted to prove that agriculture in the Han Dynasty still used slave production. He repeatedly said that "the relationship between slaves and land in the Han Dynasty is undeniable" and that "in the Han Dynasty, land and slaves did have a close relationship, and it was not 'accidental'." However, none of the examples he cited can prove his statement, but rather the opposite.

The example of Gongcheng Lizhong became his own counter-evidence. Also, the example of the cruel official Ning Cheng that he cited is the same.

Records of the Grand Historian·Biographies of Cruel Officials "Ning Cheng... lent money and bought more than a thousand qing of Pond Field, rented them to poor people, and employed thousands of families." (The Book of Han does not have the word "buy," which is quite important, but I am unwilling to delve into it in detail here.) This proves that Ning Cheng implemented the exploitation method of "dividing fields and forcibly renting," which does not help Mr. Rizhi's intended argument at all. But I want to thank Mr. Rizhi, he revealed an important historical fact in this example. He said that "in the Yang Ke Confiscation Case, no famous people (similar to Ning Cheng) were attacked; and Ning Cheng alone had more than a thousand qing of land, while the land confiscated in the Confiscation Case was only several hundred qing in large counties and only over a hundred qing in small counties. Therefore, it can be inferred that these confiscated lands were all of a not-so-large scale (for example, several qing or ten or so qing), and were completely or mostly fields cultivated by slaves." This insight is very sharp, and the speculation is quite correct. However, I want to thank Mr. Rizhi again: You have helped me a lot!

The purpose of the Yang Ke Confiscation Case was to punish treacherous merchants. Anyone who concealed or falsely reported their property tax amount was allowed to be reported by the people, and their property would be confiscated. Therefore, the Confiscation Case did not include all legal merchants, let alone pure landlords. Therefore, people like Ning Cheng were not attacked; and the amount of land confiscated was relatively less than the number of slaves, which indeed proves that those treacherous merchants not only used slaves to engage in industrial and commercial operations, but also possibly used slaves to engage in land cultivation. This was illegal and undisciplined, so those treacherous merchants suffered severe blows. Therefore, the Yang Ke Confiscation Case also proves that the Han Dynasty regime was protecting landlords and thoroughly attacking merchant slave owners.

Like this, almost all of the examples cited by Mr. Rizhi can become counter-evidence to the Han Dynasty slave system theory.

We do not deny that there was the use of slaves in the Han Dynasty, and even the large-scale use. But those slaves were basically not used for production activities. This was the case for government slaves, and it was also mostly the case for private slaves.

"There are more than 100,000 government slaves, playing and doing nothing. They tax the good people to provide for them, costing five or six hundred thousand every year." (Book of Han·Biography of Gong Yu)

"Now the county officials keep many slaves, sitting and receiving food and clothing... The people do not stop working from morning till night, while the slaves hang their sleeves and roam around." (Discourses on Salt and Iron·Scattered Insufficiency)

This is the situation after the middle of the Western Han Dynasty. According to the information from the Eastern Han Dynasty, private slaves were also extravagant and did not engage in production.

"Now the nobles in the capital... their attendants and servants all wear patterned silk and fine gauze, brocade embroidery, Gezi Shengyue cloth, Tongzhong women's cloth, rhinoceros ivory, pearls and jade, amber tortoiseshell, rockery decorations, gold and silver inlaid, reaching the extreme of beauty and flaunting each other. Those who marry, their carriages line up for several miles, and silk tents cover the road. Riding slaves and servant boys flank the wheels." (Book of the Later Han·Biography of Wang Fu—"Qianfulun·Extravagance")

"The houses of the powerful people: hundreds of buildings connected, fertile fields filling the wilderness; thousands of slaves, tens of thousands of followers (the sentence "slaves" corresponds to the sentence "connected buildings," and the sentence "followers" corresponds to the sentence "fertile fields")... Charming boys and beautiful concubines fill the embroidered chambers, and singing and music fill the deep halls." (Book of the Later Han·Biography of Zhongchang Tong—"Changyan·Governance and Disorder")

"The common people are thoughtless and do not plan for the long term. Marriages and funerals are extravagant and beautiful. Even the runners and slaves wear fine silk and gauze and put on pearls and jade." (Book of the Later Han·Emperor Anji·Edict of the Fifth Year of Yuanchu)

These all clearly indicate that Han Dynasty slaves were household slaves under the feudal system, not production slaves under the slave system. Especially the slaves who "wear fine silk and gauze and put on pearls and jade" criticized in the Edict of Emperor An are certainly not going to go down to the fields to cultivate.

Of course, there are also some cunning people who exploit slave labor to produce goods. There are quite a few examples of this, but it is not as Mr. Rizhi said that "most merchants are big slave owners." That kind of statement is truly "exaggerated." There were also legal merchants and illegal merchants in the Han Dynasty, and we should not confuse them. If we do confuse them, then how do we explain that the planners and implementers of the policy to crack down on treacherous merchants during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han were Dongguo Xianyang, Kong Jin, and Sang Hongyang, who were all from merchant backgrounds?

In short, I still believe that the Han Dynasty regime was built on the foundation of the landlord economy. It not only cracked down on merchant slave owners on the one hand, but also tried its best to protect feudal landlords on the other. The industrialists and businessmen who were attacked for exploiting slave labor were indeed remnants of the illegal slave system. Ban Gu said a few words at the end of "Biography of Money-Makers," which have long explained to us that those people were violating laws and regulations.

"Zhuo of Shu, Kong of Wan, and Diao Jian of Qi monopolized the income from mountains, rivers, copper, iron, fish, salt, markets, and streets. They used their strategies to compete with the king for profits and to imprison the industries of the common people. They all fell into the evil of breaking the rules and extravagance. What's more, digging graves, covering up, committing crimes to get rich, and people like Qu Shu, Ji Fa, and Yong Lecheng were still listed in the ranks, harming customs and ruining customs, which is the way to great chaos!"

IV. The Attitude of Handling Materials Should Be Cautious

Here, please allow me to talk about Mr. Rizhi's attitude toward handling historical materials.

Mr. Rizhi is not very cautious in citing historical materials. He has a tendency to be eager to prove a hypothesis and to select historical materials accordingly. Therefore, he does not carefully examine the historical materials, often leading to incorrect interpretations. I have already given several examples above, and I might as well give some more below.

Example 1: According to the Records of the Grand Historian·Treatise on the Balanced Standard, Emperor Wu of Han's decree in the fourth year of Yuanshou (119 BC) stipulated that merchants were not allowed to own land, "Whoever dares to violate the decree, their land and slaves will be confiscated." Mr. Rizhi believes that "land and slaves" means "land and the farming slaves on the land." In fact, this sentence in the Book of Han·Treatise on Food and Money is "confiscated land and property." Slaves are a part of property, and there is no contradiction between the two. But according to this, it can be clearly seen that slaves are not necessarily "farming slaves on the land." The way people in the Han Dynasty generally used slaves was to engage in domestic labor and industrial and commercial activities; and they could also be used as commodities for sale.

Example 2: The author quoted the Book of Han·Biography of Gong Yu, "The Han Dynasty cast money and all the iron officials set up officials, soldiers, and laborers, attacking mountains to obtain copper and iron, and the work of one year was more than 100,000 people." He believes that "laborers" are "basically slaves." I have also made this same mistake before (see "The Era of the Slave System," page 49). The reason for making the mistake is that I overlooked the next two sentences in the original text. Those two sentences are "The middle peasant feeds seven people, which means that 700,000 people are always hungry." It can be seen that almost all of the "more than 100,000" "soldiers and laborers" were temporary laborers conscripted from farmers. If 100,000 farmers were conscripted, it would reduce 100,000 people to cultivate, so it would reduce the food for 700,000 people.

Example 3: In order to prove that "the Eastern Han regime was in the hands of powerful families developed from merchant slave owner groups," Mr. Rizhi not only completely omitted the historical materials of Liu Xiu's "diligence in farming" and "engaging in agriculture," and determined that he was a "merchant slave owner," but also designated three "merchant slave owners" according to his needs. One of them was Fan Hong, who was Liu Xiu's maternal uncle. His family "had been good at farming and liked to trade" (世善农稼，好货殖), and it was clear that he was a big landlord who also engaged in industrial and commercial operations, but Mr. Rizhi only took his "trade" and abandoned his "farming."

Regarding the use of slaves to cultivate the land, the example of Fan Hong is also quite loved and has been cited repeatedly. In fact, even this example is very problematic.

"Managing industries, nothing was abandoned. Assigning tasks to children and servants, each was suitable for their position. Therefore, they were able to work together from top to bottom, and their wealth and profits doubled every year. To the point of opening up more than 300 qing of land." (Book of the Later Han·Biography of Fan Hong)

Here, "assigning tasks to children and servants, each was suitable for their position." According to the word "each," it can be seen that children and servants are two different statuses. Children are slaves, referring to servants. Servants are tenant farmers, referring to followers. Tenant farmers or followers are close to the so-called "serfs," not slaves in the strict sense.

Second, Li Tong, who persuaded Guangwu to start the uprising, "was famous for trade for generations," can indeed be said to be a "merchant," but there is no evidence of a "slave owner." In fact, Li Tong inherited his family learning and was a person who "liked astronomy and divination," "bankrupted his family for the country," and "was humble and always wanted to avoid power." It would probably not be appropriate to designate such a person as a "slave owner," right?

Third, the mother's family of Liu Xiu's concubine, Yin Lihua. The Yin family was originally a descendant of Guan Zhong. The Book of the Later Han·Biography of Yin Shi clearly states that "their ancestors came from Guan Zhong," so the Biography of Yin Xing says, "For generations, they worshiped Guan Zhong, calling him the Lord Prime Minister." Mr. Rizhi only took the phrase "For generations, they worshiped Guan Zhong" and did not mention its origin, so the Yin family became a family of merchants. Yin Zifang, the ancestor of the Yin family in the Western Han Dynasty during the reign of Emperor Xuan, suddenly became rich, "becoming extremely wealthy." The history books only say that Zifang was a filial son, and the Kitchen God showed his divinity, giving him good fortune, and did not explain the reason for his wealth. But after he started his career, "he had more than 700 qing of land, and his carriages, horses, servants, and attendants were comparable to a feudal lord" (Book of the Later Han·Biography of Yin Xing, Mr. Rizhi's cited punctuation is wrong), which is clearly also a big landlord. However, for his own convenience, Mr. Rizhi also designated the Yin family as "merchant slave owners."

As mentioned above, Emperor Guangwu Liu Xiu was a person who was "diligent in farming" and "engaged in agriculture." I also checked the origins of a group of his comrades-in-arms, such as the Twenty-Eight Generals of Yuntai: thirteen were small officials in counties and towns, eight were scholars, two were members of the imperial family, two were sons of prefects, two were unknown, and one was a famous surname. Basically, the landlord class component accounted for the majority. It is not as Mr. Rizhi said that "the Eastern Han regime was in the hands of powerful families developed from merchant slave owner groups."

In fact, the Eastern Han replacing the Xin Dynasty and the Xin Dynasty replacing the Western Han were just power transitions within the landlord class. Even the Western Han replacing the Qin Dynasty was nothing more than that. Emperor Gaozu of Han Liu Bang and a group of his comrades-in-arms were almost all commoners, and there was no question of "aristocratic slave owners" (Zhang Liang should be excluded). After their regime initially consolidated, they nominated people for the officialdom based on filial piety, brotherly love, diligence in farming (later Xiaolian), and virtuous and uprightness. Just looking at the words "diligence in farming," you can see what foundation the Han Dynasty regime was built on.

Example 4: I would also like to briefly talk about the status of the so-called "Jiaren" (merchants).

The so-called "Jiaren" in the decrees of the Qin and Han dynasties were often listed alongside fugitives, sons-in-law, and children born to slaves. Mr. Rizhi's article also mentioned this type of person. He thought they were ordinary merchants. In fact, there was a distinction between these two types of people at that time.

In ancient times, "craftsmen and merchants were fed by the officials," and ordinary Jiaren were the government's brokerage slaves. Under many official positions in the Rites of Zhou, there were often so-called "Jiaren of so many people," compared with "Xu" (assistants) and "Tu" (followers). Their status was very low. The "Jiaren" in the Qin Dynasty and the early Western Han Dynasty who were equal to slaves were the remnants of this pre-era. These should not be confused with ordinary newly rising merchants.

The above are the places where Mr. Rizhi is not very cautious in citing historical materials. I sincerely hope that researchers who seek truth from facts should strive to avoid such situations. First of all, we require that we do not start from assumptions, but from occupying extensive data. The style of "boldly assuming and carefully verifying" is not welcome; if it is "boldly assuming and recklessly verifying," then it is even less welcome.

Of course, citing classical literature and historical materials from other countries is also very necessary, but if the materials of our own country are not clear, then all theoretical foundations and comparative studies will become empty talk.

I want to solemnly declare that these impolite words are also directed at myself. I am very willing to work hard with friends and conduct in-depth exploration in a down-to-earth manner.

(1957.2.27)

[Note] "Ask the slave about farming, ask the maid about weaving," see Song Shu, Volume 77, Biography of Shen Qingzhi. Mr. Rizhi believes that this is "Han custom," but it is not. Here, slaves have become a general term for subordinates and cannot be cited as proof of the slave system. For example, Qing Dynasty ministers still called themselves "slaves," and official wives still called themselves "maids," which cannot be said that the Qing Dynasty was still a slave system.

    略论汉代政权的本质 
    ——敬复日知先生——
    郭沫若
    编者按  自从本报发表了郭沫若先生的“汉代政权严重打击奴隶主”一文以后，我们收到了一些提出不同意见的来稿。2月25日我们发表的日知先生的“从重农抑商的传统谈到汉代政权的本质”一文，就是其中的一篇。今天，我们又发表了郭沫若先生的答复。这个问题是还有必要作进一步探讨的。但是，由于这是一个专门问题，本报限于篇幅，不拟继续进行讨论。
    一、“重农抑商”与“重农轻商”有别
    日知先生的文章“从重农抑商的传统谈到汉代政权的本质”，我仔细阅读了。谢谢他对我所提出的问题作了解答。但是他的答案，很遗憾，似乎并没有使问题得到解决。
    日知先生说：“重农抑商的传统本来是奴隶制发展一定阶段的产物，是奴隶社会所固有的现象”。在这里需要改一个字，便是要把“重农抑商”改为“重农轻商”，那就不成问题了。“重农抑商”是政策，“重农轻商”是习惯，两者不可混同。如果混同了，那就有“差之毫厘，谬以千里”的危险。
    古代农业国家，一般是有重农轻商的习惯的，但如像菲尼基亚那样以商立国的国家应当例外。中国是农业国，故中国古代也有重农轻商的习惯。例如西周的礼制，天子必须亲耕藉田，而大夫则不能干预贾事。古代从事工艺和经纪的人是官家的奴隶，贵族是不能过问贱事的。但古代的重视农业并不等于平等地重视农民，农民中有自由公民，更有不自由的奴隶。故在中国文字学上，农与奴是一音之转，耨与辱是一义之转。
    然而历史在进展，就在西周末叶，周厉王已开始好利，而周宣王已开始不藉千亩。尽管诗人在讥弹“如贾三倍，君子是识”（大雅·瞻卬），然而当时的君子（贵族集团）毕竟已经着手讲究起营利的事务来了。
    东迁以后更逐步发生剧变。新的郑国就是由商人集团和贵族集团的联盟而建立起来的（左传昭公十六年）。管仲相齐，贵轻重，慎权衡，官山海（即管制盐铁），以商立国而成为五霸之首。有名的商人弦高，在救了郑国的危难之后，而高举远徙，不肯接受爵禄（故事详见淮南子人间训）。越大夫范蠡竟抛弃崇高的禄位，变名经商，泛三江，游五湖，而成为陶朱公。孔子的大门人子贡，也“不受命而货殖”（“不受命”是不做官的意思），竟能与当代诸侯分庭抗礼。孔夫子周游列国的旅费，也可能是靠着这位大弟子的捐献。洛阳的珠宝商人吕不韦更做到秦国的宰相，辅助秦始皇帝奠定了统一中国的大业，这更可以说是登峰造极了。
    中国的古代社会发展到战国时代，工商业已经解放，商人阶层已经大大抬头。天下的人都知道：“用贫求富，农不如工，工不如商；刺绣文，不如倚市门。”（史记货殖列传，汉书引作谚语，大凡一种谚语是要经过长期的酝酿的。）因此，在那时基本上是“万乘之国有万金之贾，千乘之国有千金之贾”（管子国蓄篇），竟闹到“一国而二君二王”的地步。如像孟尝君，他就是一位有名的大高利贷，那是和“巴比伦法典中的自由农民便是全权公民（而商人高利贷者——达木卡，反而不是全权者）”，是不能同日而语的。
    因此，日知先生所引用的马克思在“资本主义生产以前各形态”中所说的“古代”正适合于西周。“古代人一致认为农业是适合于自由民的唯一的事业，是训练士兵的学校。”这在中国就是所谓“寓兵于农”。马克思的断制是正确的，但日知先生把它套到两汉时代来，那就成问题了。不是尺度有问题，而是尺度的运用有问题。
    中国是大陆性的农业国家，特别是由春秋的十二诸侯归并成为战国七雄，而终于由主张大一统达到实现大一统的时代，建立在农业基础上的政权，是不能容许商业的畸形发展，特别是不合法度的商人任意兼并农民，使农民贫困化，以危害国家的基础的。这就导引出了周秦诸子中多数学派“重农抑商”的主张——有意识地抑制商业的畸形发展，而不是简单的轻视商人，更进一步而形成为秦汉两代的“重农抑商”的政策。这政策的精神，事实上也就是在巩固地主阶级的政权。
    二、租佃关系是汉代农业的普遍生产方式
    中国的地主阶级的政权是自春秋末叶开始已经逐步形成了。到了秦汉时代地主经济已经成为普遍的形态。关于这一层，汉书食货志中所载董仲舒的一段话说得很详细，很概括，我不妨再把它引用在这里：
   “秦……用商鞅之法，改帝王之制，除井田，民得卖买。富者田连仟佰，贫者亡立锥之地。（富者）又专川泽之利，管山林之饶，荒淫越制，逾侈以相高，邑有人君之尊，里有公侯之富，小民安得不困？又加月为更卒，已复为正一岁、屯戍一岁，力役三十倍于古。田租口赋、盐铁之利，二十倍于古。或耕豪民之田，见税十五。
    故贫民常衣牛马之衣，而食犬彘之食。……
    汉兴循而未改。”
    在这里地主与农民已成严重对立，“田租口赋”也已普遍存在，完全是封建社会的体制。
    但日知先生特别注意到了这段话中的一个“或”字。他认为“一个‘或’字已说明了这种方式不是普遍的现象”。仅凭一个字便下出这样重大的断案，未免下得太早了一点。我要请日知先生也注意一下“韩非子诡使篇”中的这一节话：
   “悉租税、专民力，所以备难、充仓
      府也。而士卒之逃事状（藏）匿、附托有威之门以避徭赋，而上不得者，万数。”
   “诡使篇”是韩非晚年的作品，所陈述的应当是秦代的情形。如果更早，那就更不成问题了。这是和董仲舒的话相为表里的。所不同者只是韩是赞成，董是反对。而董所说的“或”在这里是“万数”。“万数”者，以万为单位计算也。又，“万数”也可能是不计其数的意思。古人以万为“盈数”，每以万表示极多。故有万岁、万有、万籁、万物、万民、万邦、万乘等之称。请问：到底是普遍，还是不普遍？
    再说到“循而未改”的汉代。
    我现在就把日知先生所同样重视的一个例证，再引列出来申说一下。
    “候长·觻得广昌里·公乘礼忠年三十：小奴二，值三万；大婢一，二万；马五匹，二万；牛二，六千；牛车二辆，四千；轺车一乘，值万；宅一区，值万；田五顷，五万；共十五万。”（“居延汉简考释”Ⅲ·48）
    日知先生认为“这是中等以上的农民经济，有了奴隶制剥削。这些奴婢是生产的辅助力量，是和生产有关的”。他还引用了后代“耕当问奴，织当访婢”〔注〕的话来左证。我揣想，日知先生的意思大概认为那“田五顷”就是被那“小奴二”来耕种的了。然而“田五顷”是五百亩田，不会完全集中在住宅附近。请问两个“小奴”怎么能耕种那样大的地面？即使让那位“大婢”来助耕，也不可能。更何况“候长”家里有许多杂务要做，主人要服侍，房屋要打扫，牲畜要饲养，车辆要照拂；生产上的事，三个大小奴婢怎么能够兼顾？因此，认为这些奴婢“和生产有关”是不正确的。那吗，候长的五百亩田是谁替他耕种呢？候长自己是不会耕的，他也耕不了。由此可见，这条第一手资料的汉简正是绝好的史料，它证明在西汉末叶，就在居延那样的边塞地区，农业生产都已经建立在租佃关系的基础上了。
    这是从边塞地区发现的一个小例子，我也可以再引出一个非边塞地区的大例子。
    “济南安王康……多殖财货，大修宫室。奴婢至千四百人，厩马千二百匹，私田八百顷。……国傅何敞上疏谏康曰……今奴婢厩马皆有千余，增无用之口。”（后汉书·光武十王传）
    这是在济南。这位济南王的奴婢一千四百人是“无用之口”，可见他既不用来“殖财货”，也不用来耕田。厩马一千二百匹也是“无用之口”，可见也是不用来耕田的。那吗我们要问：他的八百顷私田（八万亩）是什么人替他耕呢？这里不也就表明是有广泛的租佃关系存在吗？
    我们并不否认：租佃关系或者雇佣方式在奴隶制下也可以有，但那只是萌芽状态。但像这儿所举的两例，地点偏辟如居延，地面广大如八百顷，都已建立了租佃关系，即地主与农民的关系，能够说汉朝还是奴隶制吗？能够说这种关系还是萌芽状态，而是被我们“夸大”了吗？
    问题，显然的不是被人“夸大”，而是被人“夸小”了。要把汉代认为奴隶制，那是把汉代文化估计得太低，不仅生产关系说不通，政权性质说不通，整个的社会基础和上层建筑都说不通。
    三、汉代政权保护地主并打击商人奴主
    为了要证明汉代是奴隶制，日知先生也很想证明汉代的农业依然在使用奴隶生产。他一再地说“汉代奴隶和土地的关系是不容否认的”，“在汉代，田和奴隶确有密切关系，而不是‘偶然’相连的”。然而他所引用的例子却没有一例可以证成他的说法，而是适得其反。
    像公乘礼忠的那一例就是成为了他自己的反证。还有，他所举的酷吏宁成的那一例也是同样。
    史记酷吏列传“宁成……贳贷，买陂田千余顷，假贫民，役使数千家。”（汉书无“买”字，关系相当重大，但在此不愿意琐碎地深入。）这正证明宁成是执行了“分田劫假”的剥削方式，对于日知先生所企图达到的论证目的，是丝毫也没有帮助的。但要感谢日知先生，他在这个事例中却揭发了一个重要的史实。他说“在杨可告缗案中，没有一个有名的人（类似宁成者）遭受打击；而且宁成一人的田是千余顷，而告缗没收的田，大县才数百顷，小县仅百余顷。因此可以推测，这些被没入的田都是经营规模不太大（例如若干顷或十数顷），而完全是或极大多数是奴隶耕作的田地。”这见解是很犀利的，推测也是相当正确的。然而我要再感谢一次日知先生：你却是帮了我很大的忙！
    杨可告缗案，它的目的是在惩治奸商。凡是把财产税额隐瞒不报，或报而不实的，便准许人民告发，没收他们的财产。所以告缗案并不包含一切的合法商人，更不包含纯正地主。因此，像宁成那样的人便没有遭受打击；而所没收的田地在比较上少于奴婢的数目，这也的确证明那些奸商不仅在使用奴僮从事工商业的经营，而且也可能在使用奴僮从事土地的耕作了。这是违法乱纪的，所以那些奸商们便遭受了严重的打击。因而杨可告缗案也正证明汉代政权在保护地主，而彻底打击商人奴主。
    就像这样，日知先生所引的例证几乎全部都可以成为汉代奴隶制说的反证。
    汉代有奴婢的使用，而且还是大量的使用，我们并不否认。但那些奴婢基本上是不用于生产事业的。官家奴婢是这样，私家奴婢也大抵是这样。
    “诸官奴婢十万余人，戏游无事。税良民以给之，岁费五六巨万。”（汉书·贡禹传）
    “今县官多畜奴婢，坐禀衣食。……黎民昏晨不释事，奴婢垂拱遨游也。”（盐铁论·散不足篇）
    这是西汉中叶以后的情形。据东汉的资料来看，私家奴婢也多奢华万分，不事生产。
   “今京师贵戚……其徒御仆妾皆服文组采牒、锦绣绮纨、葛子升越、筒中女布、犀象珠玉、虎魄玳瑁、石山隐饰、金银错镂，穷极丽美，转相夸咤。其嫁娶者、车骈数里，缇帷竟道，骑奴侍童、夹毂并引。”（后汉书王符传——“潜夫论·浮侈篇”）
    “豪人之室：连栋数百、膏田满野；奴婢千群、徒附万计（“奴婢”与“连栋”句相应，“徒附”与“膏田”句相应）……妖童美妾、填乎绮室，倡讴妓乐、列乎深堂。”（后汉书仲长统传——“昌言·理乱篇”）
    “小人无虑，不图久长，嫁娶送终、纷华靡丽，至有走卒奴婢、被绮縠，箸珠玑。”（后汉书安帝纪·元初五年丙子诏）
    这些都很明显地表示着：汉代奴婢是封建制度下的家奴，而不是奴隶制度下的生产奴隶。特别是安帝诏所斥责的是“小人”，可见情况的普遍。那些“被绮縠、箸珠玑”的奴婢怎么也不会下田耕作的。
    当然，也有一些狡诈的人，他们会剥削奴隶劳动来生产商品，这样的例子相当多，但也并不如日知先生所说“大多数商人都是大奴隶主”。那样的说法才是真正“夸大”了。汉代也有合法的商人和不合法的商人，我们不好混同。如果混同了，那吗怎么来解释汉武帝时打击奸商政策的策划者和执行者偏偏是出身于商人的东郭咸阳、孔仅、桑弘羊呢？
    总之，我是仍然相信，汉代政权是建立在地主经济的基础之上的，它不仅一头地打击商人奴主，而且一头地在尽力保护封建地主。受打击的剥削奴隶劳动的工商业家，的确是不合法度的奴隶制的残余。班固在“货殖传”的末尾有这样几句话，早已经跟我们说明：那些人是违法乱纪的了。
    “蜀卓、宛孔、齐之刁间，公擅山川铜
    铁鱼盐市井之入，运其筹策，上争王者之利，
    下锢齐民之业，皆陷不轨奢僭之恶。又况掘冢搏掩，犯奸成富，曲叔、稽发、雍乐成之徒，犹复齿列，伤化败俗，大乱之道也！”
    四、处理材料的态度应当谨严
    在这里，请允许我谈谈日知先生处理史料的态度。
    日知先生在引证史料上是不大谨严的。他有这样一种倾向，急于想证实一种假设，而去选择史料。因而对史料没有经过细密的检点，往往生出不正确的解释。上面我已举出了好几个例子，在下面不妨再举一些。
    例之一：日知先生根据史记平准书所载，汉武帝元狩四年（前119年）初算缗钱令中有商贾不得名田，“敢犯令，没入田僮”的话。他认为“田僮”就是“土地和土地上的耕奴”。其实这句话在汉书食货志是作“没入田财”。僮是财产的一部分，两者固没有矛盾。但根据这，可以明显地看出：僮并不一定是“土地上的耕奴”。汉代人一般使用僮的方式，是用来从事家内劳役和工商业的；并且还可以作为贩卖的商品。
    例之二：作者引用了汉书贡禹传的“汉家铸钱及诸铁官皆置吏卒徒，攻山取铜铁，一岁功十万人已上”。他认为“徒”、“基本部分是奴隶”。我从前也犯过这同样的错误（见“奴隶制时代”四十九页）。犯错误的原因是把原文接下去的两句话看忽略了。那两句话就是“中农食七人，是七十万人常受其饥也”，可见那“十万人以上”的“卒徒”差不多全部是从农民征发来的临时力役。农民被征了十万，便减少十万人耕种，故要减少七十万人的粮食。
    例之三：为了要证实“东汉政权掌握在由商人奴主集团发展而来的豪族”，日知先生不仅把刘秀“勤于稼穑”、“事农业”的史料完全略去了，断定他是“商人奴主”，他还照他的需要，派定了三家“商人奴主”。其中一家就是樊宏，是刘秀的母舅。他的家“世善农稼，好货殖”，分明是大地主而附带着经营工商业的，但日知先生却只取其“货殖”而抛弃其“农稼”。
    关于用奴隶来耕田，樊宏这一例也颇受人爱顾、屡被引用。其实连这一例都很有问题。
    “营理产业，物无所弃。课役童隶、各得其宜。故能上下戮力，财利岁倍。至乃开广田土三百余顷。”（后汉书·樊宏传）
    这里的“课役童隶、各得其宜”，根据“各”字，可知童与隶是两种不同的身分。童就是僮，是指奴婢。隶是隶农，是指徒附。隶农或徒附，接近于所谓“农奴”，并非严密意义的奴隶。
    第二是劝光武起事的李通，“世以货殖箸姓”诚然可以说是“商人”，但并没有“奴主”的证据。事实上李通继承家学，是“好星历谶记”的人，“破家为国”，而且“性谦恭，常欲避权势”。这样的人被派为“奴主”，恐怕也不大适当吧？
    第三是刘秀的妃子阴丽华的娘家。阴家本是管仲的后人，后汉书阴识传明言“其先出自管仲”，故阴兴传说“世奉管仲之祀，谓为相君”。日知先生只取其“世奉管仲之祀”而不言其来历，这样阴家就俨然成为货殖世家了。阴家的祖先，西汉宣帝时的阴子方，他突然发了财，“暴至巨富”。史书上只说子方是孝子，灶神显了神，使他得到好报，没有说明致富之由。但他起家后“田有七百余顷，舆马仆隶比于邦君”（后汉书·阴兴传，日知先生所引句读有误），则明明也是一位大地主。但是，日知先生为了自己方便，偏又派定了阴家也是“商人奴主”。
    像上面所说，光武帝刘秀既是“勤于稼穑”、“事农业”的人，他的一批战友，如云台二十八将，我把他们的出身也检查了一下：有十三位郡县小吏、八位读书人、二位宗室、二位太守之子、二位不详、一位箸姓。基本上是地主阶级成分占多数，并不如日知先生所说“东汉政权掌握在由商人奴主集团发展而来的豪族”。
    事实上，东汉代替了新莽，新莽代替了西汉，都只是地主阶级内部的政权转换。就是西汉的代替秦朝，也不过如此。汉高祖刘邦和他一群战友差不多全部是市井小民，根本说不上“贵族奴主”（张良应该除外）。他们的政权一开始巩固之后，就举孝弟力田（后来的孝廉）和贤良方正，作为官吏的进身之阶。请单看“力田”两字，就可以看到汉代政权究竟是建立在什么基础之上的了。
    例之四：关于所谓“贾人”的身分我也想简单地说一说。
    所谓“贾人”在秦汉的功令中往往和亡人、赘婿、奴产子之类并列。日知先生的文章中也提到这种人，他以为就是一般的商人。其实这两种人在当时是有区别的。
    在古时候，“工贾食官”，一般的贾人就是官家的经纪奴隶。周礼在好些职官之下多有所谓“贾若干人”，和“胥”、“徒”相比。他们的身分是很低的。秦代及西汉初年和奴隶同等的“贾人”就是这种前时代的孑遗。这和一般新起的商贾是不好混同的。
    以上就是日知先生在引用史料上不甚谨严的地方。这样的情况，我诚恳地希望，实事求是的研究者是应该努力避免的。首先我们要求：不要从假设出发，而是从占有广泛的资料出发。所谓“大胆假设、小心求证”的那种作风，是值不得欢迎的；如果是“大胆假设、大心求证”那就更值不得欢迎了。
    当然，经典文献和别国史料的引证也非常必要，但假如本国的材料没有弄清楚，那吗一切理论根据和比较研究都要成为捕空之谈。
    这些不客气的话，我要郑重声明，同时是对着我自己说的。我是十分愿意和朋友们共同努力，脚踏实地的再作深入的探讨。
         （1957．2．27）
    〔注〕“耕当问奴，织当访婢”，见宋书卷七十七沈庆之传。日知先生以为“汉俗”，并非汉俗如此。此处奴婢已成为下人的泛称，不能引为奴隶制的证明。例如清朝大臣犹自称“奴才”，命妇犹自称“婢子”，不能谓清朝犹是奴隶制。
