I listened to Chairman Mao's instructions at the Supreme State Conference, Premier Zhou's "Report on Visits to Eleven Asian and European Countries," and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC," and I fully endorse them.

As a member of the Hui nationality, I would like to express some opinions from the perspective of ethnic minorities.

In recent years, like all other nationalities, we Hui people have undergone fundamental changes and made great progress in politics, economy, and culture, thanks to the care and consideration of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and thanks to the correct implementation of the Party and the government's ethnic policies. Take Anqing City, where we live, for example: Anqing City has 4,192 Hui residents, living in the urban and suburban areas (about 100 in the suburbs). Politically, the poor Hui people, who were looked down upon in the old society, now enjoy genuine equal and democratic rights. In the municipal and district people's committees and among the municipal and district people's representatives, there are Hui members and representatives. Among the Hui people, there is one member of the municipal people's committee, two members of the district people's committee, eight municipal people's representatives, ten district people's representatives, four members of the municipal CPPCC, and representatives and members of the Hui people in the suburban township people's committees, the municipal democratic youth federation, and the women's federation. In recent years, under the education and training of the Party and the People's Government, more than 100 Hui people have participated in work in government organs. Because they have demonstrated a high degree of patriotism and active labor enthusiasm in their respective work posts, some of them have been admitted to the Chinese Communist Party and the Communist Youth League. Culturally, there are two Hui primary schools in Anqing City, with 527 children enrolled in the city, and 140 students studying in junior and senior high schools. Hui students facing difficulties can enjoy tuition reductions and exemptions, and students above junior high school are also assessed and awarded scholarships based on their actual circumstances. Those with particularly difficult living situations are also given living allowances, which solves the enrollment problems of many Hui students in need. In terms of employment, the municipal labor department also gives priority to the Hui people. For example, when Chongqing Iron and Steel Plant and Wuhan River Transport Technical School recruited students in Anqing last year, 70 Hui youths were recruited to participate in learning at one time. The municipal agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative also recruited more than 30 people to engage in agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production. In March of last year, the municipal civil affairs department, in accordance with the instructions of the central government and the province, mobilized 30 Hui households, totaling 130 people, to immigrate to Qinghai to participate in agricultural production. The government is very concerned about their production and living conditions. Anhui Province also organized a visiting group to Qinghai Province in October last year to express their regards to them. In addition, Hui people in the suburbs have joined advanced agricultural cooperatives, Hui handicraftsmen have joined production cooperatives and groups, capitalist industry and commerce have implemented overall public-private joint ventures, and small merchants and peddlers have implemented cooperation, thus greatly changing their economic outlook. In addition, impoverished Hui people can also enjoy reduced or subsidized medical expenses, and Hui people facing livelihood difficulties also receive regular and temporary relief from the government, and so on. All of these are achievements made by the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government in correctly implementing the great ethnic policy. Recalling the old society, what we Hui people received was only national oppression, discrimination, and insult, forcing the Hui people to not dare to say that they were Hui people. Not only were there no political rights, but economically and culturally, they were extremely poor and extremely suffered. However, since liberation, it has brought happiness to the Hui people, and the unequal phenomena of oppression and discrimination have been completely eliminated. Now we are not only equal in political status, but also gradually improving in economic and cultural aspects. These are all personally experienced by our Hui people, and all are learned from their own experience. As a Hui person of a minority nationality, I believe that only under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao can such happiness be obtained.

The above, although it is the situation of one region, specifically illustrates the main achievements in our ethnic work. We believe that these main achievements are very significant in all regions and throughout the country. We should affirm the achievements made by the Party and the government in correctly implementing the ethnic policy: these achievements are fundamental. However, are there any shortcomings and errors in ethnic work? We also believe that there are certain shortcomings, and even errors are unavoidable. For example, when implementing the ethnic policy, some have not been implemented at all levels, and some have not fully understood the ethnic policy, so there are still certain defects in the implementation. Even in individual regions and individual cadres, they do not understand what the ethnic policy is. During the socialist transformation, some ignored the characteristics of ethnic minorities, or did not respect their opinions well. Some Han cadres even used coercive methods to carry out their work without regard to the conditions. In the development of economic and cultural work, the difficulties of ethnic minorities in production, life, and culture have not been resolved in a timely manner. There is still a lack of respect for the living habits of ethnic minorities. It feels difficult to get Hui meals on ships and trains, and it has not been properly resolved. In particular, Han chauvinism still exists, and some even express it very strongly. These are serious obstacles to further developing the mutual assistance and cooperation between the brotherly nationalities, and the harm to the socialist construction of the motherland is very great. At the same time, there is still local nationalism among our ethnic minorities, some of which are very serious, which also hinders the unity of the people of all nationalities and the progress and development of the nationalities themselves. The people of our various ethnic minorities must pay close attention and overcome local nationalism. We believe that the above are the difficulties discovered on the road ahead. We have full confidence that under the leadership and care of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, they can be gradually resolved and corrected in accordance with the conditions.

Therefore, we must further seriously publicize and implement the ethnic policy, continue to carry out self-education and mutual education among nationalities, and through the exemplary practical actions of advanced elements of all nationalities, drive and influence the masses, criticize Han chauvinism and local nationalism in our own nationalities, and make the people of ethnic minorities more clearly aware that mutual distrust, even mutual discrimination, between nationalities is only beneficial to the enemy and harmful to the people of all nationalities. The Han people must respect the political rights, customs, and habits of the people of ethnic minorities, and help ethnic minorities develop various construction undertakings. The people of ethnic minorities must warmly welcome the help of the Han people, unite and help each other, cooperate in friendship, develop production, and thereby improve their lives. At the same time, it is also necessary to continue to strengthen the friendly relations between nationalities, promote unity and mutual assistance between nationalities, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, strive for the common interests of the people of all nationalities and for the common construction of a free, equal, united, and friendly big family for the people of all nationalities—the great socialist construction of the motherland!

### 继续加强民族间的友爱关系  马轶尘的发言

    继续加强民族间的友爱关系
    马轶尘的发言
    我听了毛主席在最高国务会议上的指示，周总理“关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告”和陈叔通副主席关于“政协第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告”，我完全表示拥护。
    我是一个回族人民，因此，我从少数民族方面，发表一些意见。
    几年来，我们回族人民和各族人民一样，由于中国共产党和人民政府的关怀和照顾，由于党和政府正确的贯彻执行了民族政策，我们回民，无论是政治、经济、文化那方面，都起了根本的变化，都得到很大的进步。就拿我们所住的安庆市来说：安庆市有回民四千一百九十二人，分别居住在市区和郊区（郊区约一百人）。在政治上，旧社会被看不起的穷回回，今天已享受到真正的平等的民主权利。在市、区人民委员会里，和市、区人民代表当中，都有回民的委员和代表。回民中计有市人民委员会委员一人，区人民委员会委员二人，市人民代表八人，区人民代表十人，市政协委员四人，郊区乡人民委员会、市民主青年联合会和妇女联合会里，都有回民的代表和委员。几年来，在党和人民政府的教育培养下，参加机关工作的回民已达一百人以上。由于在各个工作岗位上发挥了高度的爱国主义思想和积极的劳动热情，他们当中有部分的人，已经被吸收参加了中国共产党和青年团。在文化上，安庆市有回民小学两所，全市入学儿童五百二十七人，在初中和高中求学的达一百四十人。困难的回民学生，可以享受减免学费的照顾，初中以上学生还根据实际情况评发助学金，对生活特殊困难的，还给他们以生活补助，从而解决了不少回民困难学生的入学问题。在就业方面，市劳动部门对回民也给予优先照顾，如去年重庆钢铁厂和武汉河运技工学校两单位到安庆招生，一次就有回民青年七十人被吸收参加学习，市农林牧生产社还吸收了三十多人，从事农林牧生产。去年3月，市民政部门，根据中央和省的指示，又动员了回民三十户一百三十人，移民青海参加农业生产，政府对他们的生产和生活都非常关心。安徽省于去年10月还组织了访问团到青海省去向他们进行慰问。其他，如郊区回民都参加了高级农业合作社，手工业回民都参加了生产社、组，资本主义工商业都实行了全行业的公私合营，小商小贩都实行合作化，因此，已经大大的改变了他们的经济面貌。此外，贫困回民，在医疗上还可以享受减免费或补助医药费的照顾，生活困难的回民还得到政府定期和临时的救济，等等。所有这些，都是中国共产党和人民政府，正确的贯彻执行了伟大的民族政策所取得的成就。回想在旧社会里，我们回民所得到的，只是民族间的压迫、歧视和侮辱，逼得回民不敢说自己是回民。不但政治上毫无权利，就是经济上、文化上，都是极端贫困、极端感受痛苦的。可是，从解放以后，给回族人民带来了幸福，被压迫、被歧视的不平等现象，已全被扫除。现在我们不但政治地位平等，就是经济和文化方面，都已逐步提高。这些，都是我们回族人民亲身经历的，都是从自己亲身经验中体会出来的。做为少数民族的回民来说，认为只有在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，才可以获得这样的幸福。
    上面所说的，虽然是一个地区的情况，但也就具体说明了我们民族工作中的主要成就。我们认为这些主要成就，在各个地区，在全国范围内，都是非常巨大的。我们对于党和政府正确贯彻执行了民族政策所取得的成就，应该肯定的指出：这些成就，是基本的。但是，在民族工作中还有没有缺点和错误呢？我们又认为，还是有一定的缺点，甚至错误还是不可避免的。例如：在执行民族政策的时候，有的还没有层层贯彻，有的对民族政策体会还不够，因此，在执行上还存在一定的缺陷。甚至在个别地区，个别干部，还不懂得什么是民族政策。在社会主义改造的时候，有的忽视少数民族的特点，或者没有很好的尊重他们的意见。有的汉族干部，甚至不根据条件，用强迫命令的办法去进行工作。在发展经济和文化工作中，对少数民族的生产、生活以及文化方面的困难，未能及时给以解决。对少数民族的生活习惯，还存在有不尊重的现象。轮船、火车上，回民的伙食就感觉困难，还没有得到适当的解决。特别是大民族主义思想还有存在，有的甚至表现得很强烈。这些，对于进一步发展各兄弟民族间的互助合作关系，是一个严重的障碍，对于祖国社会主义建设事业的危害是很大的。同时，在我们少数民族中间，也还存在着地方民族主义思想，有的并且很严重，这也妨害了各民族人民的团结和民族本身的进步和发展。我们各少数民族的人民必须十分注意，要克服地方民族主义思想。以上这些，我们认为，是前进道路上所发现的困难，我们有完全信心，在中国共产党和人民政府的领导和关怀下，一定可以根据条件，逐步得到解决和得到纠正的。
    因此，我们必须进一步认真的宣传和贯彻执行民族政策，继续开展民族间的自我教育和相互教育，通过各民族的先进分子以身作则的实际行动，带动和影响群众，批判本民族中的大民族主义和地方民族主义思想，使少数民族人民更清楚的认识到：民族间的互不相信，甚至互相歧视，只是对敌人有利，对各民族人民是有害的。汉族人民要尊重少数民族人民的政治权利、风俗习惯，帮助少数民族发展各项建设事业。少数民族人民更要热情的欢迎汉族人民的帮助，团结互助，友爱合作，以发展生产，从而提高生活。同时，还要继续加强民族间的友爱关系，促进民族间的团结互助，在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，为各民族人民的共同利益，为共同建设各民族人民自由平等、团结友爱的大家庭——祖国伟大的社会主义建设事业而奋斗！
