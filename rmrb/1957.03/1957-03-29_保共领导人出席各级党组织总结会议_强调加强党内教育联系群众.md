Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, March 28th: Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee leaders Zhivkov, Yugov, Chervenkov, and others recently emphasized to party organizations in some states and counties the importance of strengthening political and ideological education within the party and closely connecting with the masses.

Party organizations below the state level of the Bulgarian Communist Party have recently held general meetings to summarize work and elect new leadership. Comrades Zhivkov and others attended some of these meetings held by state and county party organizations and gave speeches.

Yugov, speaking at the party organization meeting in Turnovo State, said that party organizations at all levels must unswervingly use Marxism-Leninism to educate party members and continuously improve their cultural and political-ideological level. The primary task of party organizations at all levels is to wage an irreconcilable struggle against all phenomena that are opposed to Marxism-Leninism and to carry out extensive education work among party members, non-party members, and youth.

Yugov also said that the strength of our party lies in its deep-rooted connection with the broad masses of working people. Without this connection, the party cannot move forward and cannot play a leading role in socialist construction.

At these meetings held by various party organizations, party members unanimously expressed their support for the party's policies and activities and pledged to strive to complete this year's national economic plan.

　　保共领导人出席各级党组织总结会议
　　强调加强党内教育联系群众
    据新华社索非亚28日电  保加利亚共产党中央的领导人日夫科夫、于哥夫、契尔文科夫等同志最近向一些州、县的党组织强调指出了加强党内政治思想教育、密切党同群众的联系的重要性。
    保共州以下的各级党组织最近普遍举行了总结工作和改选的大会。日夫科夫等同志分别出席了一些州、县党组织所举行的这种会议，并且讲了话。
    于哥夫在图尔诺沃州的党组织大会上讲话时说，各级党组织必须坚持不渝地用马克思列宁主义思想教育党员，不断提高他们的文化水平和政治思想水平。各级党组织的首要任务是向各种同马克思列宁主义思想对立的现象作不调和的斗争，在党员、党外群众和青年中进行广泛的教育工作。
    于哥夫还说，我们党的力量在于它同广大劳动人民群众有着根深蒂固的联系。没有这种联系，党就不可能前进一步，就不可能在社会主义建设中起领导作用。
    在各个党组织所举行的这种大会上，党员一致表示赞同党的各项政策和活动，为完成今年的国民经济计划而奋斗。
