The Beijing Municipal Women's Federation Carries Out "Five Good" Publicity
Housewives Universally Educated

(Our newspaper dispatch) From the beginning of February, the Beijing Municipal Democratic Women's Federation successively launched a widespread "Five Good" publicity campaign in various urban and rural districts of the city, which has achieved good results. At present, each district is holding small-scale forums to exchange experiences in implementing the "Five Good" campaign.

The broad masses of housewives generally welcomed the "Five Good" publicity. For example, Xidan District held 965 small-scale meetings, with over 30,000 residents attending. Some housewives, burdened with heavy housework and many children, who couldn't come to the meetings, pulled the street activists to their homes for a supplementary lecture. In Lai Street, an old lady listened to the "Five Good" publicity during the day and borrowed materials from the reporter in the evening to have her young grandson copy them. She said, "I'll have my grandson read it to me when he has time."

After widespread publicity, the broad masses of housewives have gained a certain degree of understanding of the content and significance of the "Five Good" campaign. Sister Yang, who lives in Fensiting, said, "I used to think that a housewife like me, taking care of children and cooking at home, made no contribution to socialist construction. After hearing the 'Five Good' publicity, I realized that doing a good job in household affairs is also beneficial to socialist construction." Many women also have a new understanding of planned spending and thriftiness. Wang Yurong, a housewife in Mashenmiao, Xidan District, said, "If every household's expenses are not well planned, workers will have to borrow from the state, which will increase the state's burden!" Many women have also deposited their savings in banks.

After the publicity, there has also been varying degrees of change in those who previously lacked unity in their families or neighborhoods. In Xidan District, an old lady Duan, with a family of five, had disagreements between her daughter-in-law and sisters-in-law. After listening to the "Five Good" publicity this time, she went back and said, "The government cares about us so much, we would be letting the government down if we quarrel again." Thirteen households live at No. 13 Dashuiche Hutong. In the past, they were not united. After the meeting this time, they took the initiative to get together and offered each other suggestions, determined to improve their relationship.

Many women have also realized the importance of learning through publicity, and have signed up to participate in cultural studies one after another, and those who have dropped out have requested to return to school.

    北京市妇联开展“五好”宣传
    家庭妇女普遍受到教育
    本报讯  从2月初起，北京市民主妇女联合会向全市各市区先后开展了“五好”的普遍宣传，收到了良好效果。目前各区正在召开小型座谈会，交流执行“五好”的经验。
    广大家庭妇女对“五好”宣传普遍表示欢迎。如西单区召开了九百六十五个小型片会，到会居民达三万多人。有些家庭妇女家务繁，孩子多，不能出来开会，就拉着街道积极分子到家里去补讲一次。象来街有个老太太，白天听了“五好”宣传，晚上就向报告员借材料，让他的小孙子给抄了一份。她说：“有空就让我孙子给念念。”
    经过普遍宣传，广大的家庭妇女对“五好”内容和意义的了解都有了一定的提高。在分司厅住的杨大嫂说：“从前我想像我这样一个家庭妇女，在家带孩子作饭，对社会主义建设事业没有一点贡献，听到‘五好’宣传后，才知道我们搞好家务对社会主义建设也有好处。”不少妇女对计划开支、勤俭治家，也有了新的理解。西单区马神庙家庭妇女王玉荣说：“如果每家的开支计划得不好，职工就要向国家借支，这样就会增加国家的负担！”还有许多妇女把节省下来的生活费用送到银行去储蓄。
    经过宣传，过去在家庭或邻里之间团结不够好的，也有了不同程度的改变。西单区有一位段老太太，全家五口人，婆媳、妯娌之间都不和，这次听了“五好”宣传后，回去说：“政府这样关心我们，我们再吵架，真对不起政府。”大水车胡同十三号住着十三户人家，过去团结不好，这次开会后，主动凑在一起互相提了意见，决心改善关系。
    还有不少妇女通过宣传认识到学习的重要性，纷纷报名参加文化学习，已退学的又要求复学。
