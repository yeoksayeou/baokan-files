Shanghai's Many Primary and Secondary School Students
Love Labor, Love Their Schools

    Many primary and secondary schools in Shanghai have established a good style of running schools through diligence and frugality.

    Yucai Middle School has always paid relatively close attention to thrift, and they have consistently implemented a system of exchanging old items for new ones when receiving them. This semester, the school plans to save 5% of administrative expenses each month. The Second Central Primary School in the Yimiao District has also achieved greater results in running the school through diligence and frugality. The main reason is that "everyone cares and everyone takes action." For example, teachers use waste materials to make various visual teaching aids; students also help teachers make arithmetic teaching aids; civil servants use their brains to make printing ink with ink ash, castor oil, and domestic lithographic oil, replacing foreign printing ink. The comrades in the administrative office estimate what teaching aids teachers need during the holidays, borrowing what can be borrowed and making what can be made themselves. They used cardboard coated with ink and aerated water to make paper blackboards, which were distributed to each teacher at the beginning of the school year. They also transformed three dilapidated organs into one accordion. Teachers and students of Yangjing Middle School and Nanmatou Primary School personally planted trees, paved roads, filled in stinking creeks, and painted walls, making their campuses tidy and beautiful. Nanmatou Primary School has saved 1,855 yuan in painting costs over the years.

    Through these activities, students in various schools have cultivated a good style of loving labor and loving their schools. Under the guidance of teachers, junior high school students at the Sixty-second Middle School made their own chemical experiment teaching aids such as alcohol lamps. When the students saw the white salt being refined through the teaching aids they made themselves, they jumped up with joy. Once, on a rainy day, students at Nanmatou Primary School saw a teacher stumble on a sidewalk that was not paved with bricks. They immediately gathered, held umbrellas, and quickly paved the sidewalk with bricks. In the Yangjing Middle School campus, no one breaks off flower branches. Once, when the tide of the Huangpu River rose to the shore, students resting at home rushed to school to support the trees they had personally cultivated one by one and filled them with mud. One rainy night, a strong wind suddenly blew, and the students sleeping in the dormitory put on their clothes and closed all the doors and windows in the classrooms.

Shenyang Colleges and Universities Practice Economy Vigorously
Spend Less Money, Accomplish More

    Under the slogan of "Running Schools Through Diligence and Frugality, Practicing Economy Vigorously," colleges and universities in Shenyang have taken action, and new atmospheres have emerged in terms of savings.

    Responsible comrades of many colleges and universities, combined with the specific conditions of each school, made mobilization reports to all faculty and staff, criticizing certain wasteful phenomena and calling on everyone to carry forward the fine tradition of running schools through diligence and frugality. The Northeast University of Finance and Economics and the Northeast Institute of Technology have already inspected certain wasteful situations in the past and put forward measures for increasing production and practicing economy in the future. The responsible comrade of the Northeast Institute of Technology made a report to all comrades in the institute on "Comprehensively Launching the Movement to Increase Production and Practice Economy," summarizing the situation and problems in carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy in the school in the past. The general affairs department of the Northeast University of Finance and Economics once held a meeting on the allocation of public funds indicators, and proposed that it is necessary to resolutely implement the principle of spending less money and doing more things well; implement careful calculation and strict economy in all aspects to ensure teaching while saving state funds.

    In carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy, the enthusiasm and initiative of boiler workers in various colleges and universities are very high. Boiler workers at the Northeast Institute of Technology, the Northeast University of Finance and Economics, and the Shenyang Agricultural College have all come up with some methods to save coal. The boiler workers of the Northeast University of Finance and Economics release heat according to the temperature, and mix crushed coal with water to prevent coal from escaping from the chimney. The combustion rate of coal has been generally improved in various boiler rooms. The Northeast University of Finance and Economics expects to save more than 600 tons of coal for the country. According to the original plan, the Northeast Institute of Technology still needs to purchase 1,500 tons of coal this year. Now they propose that in addition to ensuring that the original plan is not purchased, they will also save 570 tons.

    Various colleges and universities have also come up with some methods in terms of saving electricity, office supplies, and running meals well and saving grain. The Northeast Institute of Technology saved a total of 110,000 catties of grain in 1956. The Northeast Art College reduced office expenses by one-half compared to the past while ensuring that work is done well.

    In improving the utilization rate of instruments, Shenyang Medical College, Northeast Institute of Technology, and Shenyang Institute of Physical Education have all come up with some specific methods. The supply departments of various schools will purchase according to needs in the future to eliminate the phenomenon of instrument backlog. In order to reduce instrument damage, various schools have also formulated strict management systems.

    勤俭办学的好风气
    上海许多中小学生
    爱劳动　爱学校
    上海市许多中小学校，已树立了勤俭办学的风气。
    育材中学是一向比较注意节约的，他们一直执行领新的东西要用旧东西来调换的制度。这学期，该校准备每月节约行政费用5％。邑庙区二中心小学在勤俭办学方面，也取得了较大的成绩，主要原因在于“人人关心，个个动手”。例如教师利用废物自制各种直观教具；学生也帮助教师作算术教具；公务员开动脑筋用墨灰、蓖麻油加上本国石印油，制成了印油，代替了外国印油。事务处工作同志每当假期就估计到教师需要哪些教具，能借的借，能自制的就自制。他们用马粪纸涂上墨和泡力水做好了纸黑板，在开学时每个教师都分配到。他们还把三架破旧不堪的风琴，改装成一架手风琴。洋泾中学、南码头小学师生都亲自动手种植树木，铺道路，填臭水浜，粉刷墙壁，把自己的校园打扮得又整齐又美丽。南码头小学几年来节约的粉刷费即达一千八百五十五元。
    通过这些活动，培养了各校学生爱劳动、爱学校的好风气。六十二中学初中学生在教师指导下，自制了化学实验教具酒精灯等，当同学们看到洁白的盐是通过他们自制的教具精炼出来时，他们高兴得跳起来。南码头小学的学生，有一次下雨天，看见老师在一块没有铺砖的走道上跌了一交，他们马上集合起来，撑着雨伞，很快地把走道铺好了砖头。在洋泾中学校园里，没有一人折花枝。有一次当黄浦江潮水涨到岸上时，在家休息的学生赶紧到校，把亲手栽培的树木一棵一棵地扶起来，填上了泥。在一个雨夜里，突然刮起了大风，睡在宿舍里的学生们披上了衣服，把教室里一扇扇门窗全部关好。
    沈阳高等学校厉行节约
    少花钱　多办事
    沈阳市各高等学校，在“勤俭办学，厉行节约”的口号下，行动起来了。并在节约方面，出现了一些新气象。
    许多高等学校的负责同志，结合各学校的具体情况，向全校教职人员做了动员报告，批判了某些浪费现象，并号召大家发扬勤俭办学的优良风气。东北财经学院、东北工学院，已经检查了过去的某些浪费情况，并提出了今后在增产节约方面的措施。东北工学院的负责同志向全院同志做了“全面开展增产节约运动”的报告，总结了过去在学校中开展增产节约中的情况和问题。东北财经学院总务部门曾召开了公务费指标分配会议，并提出一定要坚决贯彻少花钱多办事，把事情办好的原则；在各方面实行精打细算，厉行节约，达到既保证教学，又节约国家资金的目的。
    在开展增产节约运动中，各高等学校锅炉工人的热情和积极性都很高。东北工学院、东北财经学院以及沈阳农学院的锅炉工人，都在节约用煤方面想出了一些办法。东北财经学院的锅炉工人根据气温放送暖气，碎煤掺水防止煤从烟筒里跑掉。各锅炉房普遍地提高了煤的燃烧率。东北财经学院预计能为国家节约六百多吨煤。东北工学院按原订计划，今年还需购煤一千五百吨，现在他们提出除保证原订计划不买外，还节约五百七十吨。
    在节约用电、办公用品和办好伙食节约粮食等方面，各高等学校也都想出了一些办法。东北工学院在1956年一年当中，共计节约了十一万斤粮食。东北美术专科学校在保证作好工作的情况下，办公用费比过去缩减二分之一。
    在提高仪器的利用率上，沈阳医学院、东北工学院、沈阳体育学院等校都想了一些具体办法。各学校的供应部门今后都要按着需要来购买，以杜绝仪器的积压现象。为了减少仪器的损坏现象，各学校也都制订了严格的保管制度。
