    French Working People Commemorate the 86th Anniversary of the Paris Commune
    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 18th: The French working people commemorated the 86th anniversary of the founding of the Paris Commune on the 18th. The "l'Humanité" newspaper published an article by Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the French Communist Party, commemorating the event. Duclos recounted the suppression of the Paris Commune by the German army and the Versaillais, then pointed out: Today, the appointment of General Speidel, formerly under Hitler, as commander of the Central European ground forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is a reappearance of the reactionary alliance formed by the French and German bourgeoisie in 1871.

    法国劳动人民纪念巴黎公社成立八十六周年
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社巴黎18日讯：法国劳动人民18日纪念巴黎公社宣布成立的八十六周年。当天的“人道报”登载了法共中央书记杜克洛的纪念文章。杜克洛追述了当年德国军队和凡尔赛分子共同镇压巴黎公社的经过，然后指出：今天，原来是希特勒手下的将军斯派达尔被任命为北大西洋公约组织中欧地区地面部队司令，这正是1871年法、德资产阶级所结成的反动联盟的再现。
