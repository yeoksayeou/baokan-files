　　Disarmament Negotiations Should Take the First Step

    The spokesperson for the Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the 26th, putting forward two constructive suggestions on the issue of disarmament: First, it requested the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee, currently meeting in London, to take practical action and draft a concrete plan acceptable to all parties regarding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons and the reduction of national armaments; Second, it called for the conclusion of an international agreement stipulating a temporary halt to the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons for an appropriate period.

    These two proposals embody the Soviet Union's sincerity in seeking an agreement on the issue of disarmament by all possible means, and also present the Western countries with a new test.

    The United Nations has been discussing the issue of disarmament for eleven years, and the Disarmament Commission and the Disarmament Subcommittee have been working for four or five years. The Soviet government has repeatedly put forward proposals that conform to the wishes of the people of the world, and has adopted some of the proposals of Western countries in these proposals in order to seek agreement. Since 1955, the Soviet Union has also taken the lead in reducing its armed forces by more than 1.8 million people, setting an example for all countries. However, the Western countries, headed by the United States, are keen on the so-called "position of strength" policy, expanding armaments and preparing for war on the one hand, and using meaningless empty talk to perfunctorily deal with public opinion at disarmament conferences, even abandoning their original proposals midway to create a deadlock. At this London meeting, the Soviet Union made another major effort, putting forward comprehensive and concrete proposals for a phased reduction of armaments and a ban on nuclear weapons, and in this proposal further adopted some of the proposals of Western countries, including the United States. Therefore, as long as the Western countries do not create extraneous obstacles, it should be possible for the London Conference to draft a disarmament plan.

    The Soviet proposal to conclude an agreement on temporarily halting nuclear weapon tests has more urgent significance at the current stage. If the disarmament conference can achieve success in this area, it could greatly improve the international atmosphere, increase mutual trust between countries, and facilitate the conclusion of a comprehensive disarmament and nuclear weapons ban agreement.

    The demand to stop hydrogen bomb and atomic bomb tests is now the unanimous call of the people of the world. The Japanese people, who have suffered the disasters of atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb tests, as well as the Japanese parliament and government, have repeatedly protested and appealed to the United States, Britain and other countries and the United Nations, demanding an immediate halt to hydrogen bomb tests. The broad masses of people and social public opinion in various countries around the world, including many scientists and political figures in the United States, Britain and other countries, have also called for a halt to hydrogen bomb tests. In accordance with the wishes of the people of the world, the Soviet government has long put forward a proposal to sign an international agreement that unconditionally prohibits atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb tests. However, Western countries have been playing tricks and rejecting the Soviet proposal. In the communique issued after the meeting between the heads of the US and British governments in Bermuda in late March, they openly declared that they would continue to conduct nuclear tests, and tied the issue of banning hydrogen bomb tests to the overall disarmament issue, thereby refusing or delaying reaching an agreement in this regard. This shows their determination to continue to pursue a policy of insane arms race. The heads of the US and British governments pretended in the meeting communique that they would "exercise restraint" in nuclear testing, but discerning people can see that since they are not prepared to stop testing, then this so-called "restraint" is only a deception and perfunctory response to world public opinion.

    For the sake of peace and the interests of mankind, the Soviet government has once again made a major compromise. It calls on the United States, Britain and other countries to agree to sign an agreement to temporarily stop testing these weapons, even if they are unwilling to immediately and unconditionally prohibit atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb tests, in order to meet the expectations of the people of all countries. It can be said that the Soviet Union has done everything in its power. If the governments of the United States and Britain want to prove that their so-called "restraint" is not completely deceptive nonsense, if they have even a little bit of sincerity in disarmament, they should agree to the Soviet Union's proposal to temporarily halt testing, thereby allowing the marathon disarmament negotiations to take the first step.

### 裁军谈判应当跨出第一步了

　　裁军谈判应当跨出第一步了
    苏联外交部发言人在26日发表声明，对裁军问题提出了两项建设性意见：一、要求正在伦敦开会的联合国裁军小组委员会采取实际的行动，草拟一项各方面都可以接受的关于禁止原子武器和氢武器、裁减各国军备的具体方案；二、缔结一项国际协定，规定适当期限暂时停止原子武器和氢武器的试验。
    这两项主张，体现了苏联尽一切可能来谋求达成裁军问题协议的诚意，同时也使西方国家面临了新的考验。
    联合国讨论裁军问题已历时十一年之久，裁军委员会和裁军小组委员会也工作四五年了。苏联政府曾屡次提出符合世界人民愿望的建议，并且在这些建议中采纳了一些西方国家的主张，以谋求协议。1955年以来，苏联还主动地裁减了武装部队一百八十余万人，以为各国的表率。但是，以美国为首的西方国家却热衷于所谓“实力地位”政策，一面扩军备战，一面在裁军会议上用无谓的空谈来敷衍舆论，甚至中途抛弃原来自己提出的主张以制造僵局。在这次伦敦会议上，苏联又作了重大的努力，提出了分阶段裁减军备和禁止核子武器的全面的具体建议，并在这个建议中进一步采纳了包括美国在内的西方国家的一些主张。因此，只要西方国家不再节外生枝，伦敦会议草拟出一项裁军方案应当是可能的。
    苏联提出的缔结暂时停止核武器试验协定的建议，在目前阶段具有更迫切的意义。如果裁军会议能在这方面取得成就，就可能大大改善国际气氛，增加国际间的相互信任，并有利于导向全面裁军和禁止核武器的协议的达成。
    要求停止氢弹和原子弹试验，现在已是全世界人民一致的呼声。曾经遭受原子弹和氢弹试验的灾难的日本人民，以及日本议会和政府，曾再三向美英等国和联合国提出抗议和呼吁，要求立即停止氢弹试验。世界各国的广大人民和社会舆论，包括美英等国的许多科学家和政治界人士，也纷纷要求停止氢弹试验。根据世界人民的意愿，苏联政府早就提出了签订无条件地禁止原子弹和氢弹试验的国际协议的建议。但是，西方国家却玩弄各种花招，拒绝苏联的建议。美英两国政府首脑3月下旬在百慕大会谈后发表的公报中，公然声言要继续进行原子核试验，并且把禁止氢弹试验的问题和全面的裁军问题牵扯在一起，借此来拒绝或拖延在这方面达成协议。这表明他们决心继续奉行疯狂的军备竞赛的政策。美英政府首脑在会谈公报中假惺惺地说要在原子核试验方面“实行克制”，但是明眼人都能看出，它们既然不准备停止试验，那末这种所谓“克制”只是对世界舆论的蒙骗和敷衍而已。
    苏联政府为了和平和人类的利益，这次又作了重大的妥协。它要求美英等国即使不愿意立即无条件地禁止原子弹和氢弹试验，也应该同意签订一项暂时停止试验这些武器的协定，以符各国人民的期望。苏联的态度可以说是仁至义尽了。美英两国政府如果要证明它们的所谓“克制”不完全是骗人的鬼话，如果它们还有一点点裁军的诚意，就应该同意苏联这项暂时停止试验的建议，从而使马拉松式的裁军谈判跨出第一步。
