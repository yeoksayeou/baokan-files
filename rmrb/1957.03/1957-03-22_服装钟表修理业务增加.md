　　Increased Business in Clothing and Watch Repair

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the repair business in Shanghai's clothing, watch, and shoe stores has greatly increased recently. According to people familiar with the market, this is a new phenomenon that has arisen following the formation of a thrifty spirit among Shanghai residents.

    A recent typical survey conducted in the Huangpu, Penglai, and Yimiao districts, where clothing stores are concentrated in Shanghai, showed that from the Spring Festival to the present, the number of old clothes refurbished by nine clothing stores has increased by 20% to threefold compared to the same period last year. Shanghai's famous watch stores, Henglilai and Hengdali, now repair two to three hundred watches for customers every day. Shoe repair stalls scattered in various corners of Shanghai are also particularly busy.

    In order to adapt to the new needs of the market, many stores in these industries have expanded their business scope and strengthened their services. Shanghai's most bustling Guanxin Hat Shop on Nanjing Road is also making preparations and will soon open a business for renovating old hats.

　  服装钟表修理业务增加
    据新华社讯　上海的服装、钟表和鞋帽商店的修理业务近来都有很大的增加。据熟悉商情的人说，这是上海居民俭朴风气形成后的新景象。
    上海服装商店较集中的黄浦，蓬莱和邑庙区最近作了一次典型调查，从春节到现在，九家服装店收到的旧衣服翻新的件数比去年这时候增加了20％到三倍。上海著名的亨得利和亨达利两家钟表店，现在每天要代客修理二、三百只钟表。散布在上海各个角落的皮鞋摊店修补业务也特别忙碌。
    为了适应市场的新需要，这些行业中的许多商店扩大了经营范围，加强服务。上海最热闹的南京路上冠新帽子店也正进行筹备，不久将开办旧帽翻新的业务。
