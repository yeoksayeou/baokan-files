Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 13th: The sluggish situation of spring plowing production in Guangdong Province has begun to turn around, and a production upsurge has appeared in some areas. At present, the sowing work has already begun. In the Chaoshan Plain, the Pearl River Delta, and the Huiyang Special Zone, the attendance rate of members of agricultural cooperatives has reached over 90%. Among them, the number of people attending work in the Huiyang Special Zone is even greater than during the spring drought resistance and rush planting last year. The amount of manure accumulated throughout the province has increased from 1.2 billion dan to 2 billion dan in the past half month. In Chaoan, Chenghai, Dongguan, Panyu and other counties, where more manure has been accumulated, the average amount has reached more than 10,000 jin per mu.

Around the Spring Festival, the leading organs of Guangdong Province had already discovered that the progress of preparatory work for spring plowing was slow. At that time, measures were taken to reverse this situation. However, until half a month ago, because many cadres and masses still underestimated the achievements of agricultural cooperativization and technological reform last year, and the remarks that doubted agricultural cooperativization had not been strongly criticized, coupled with the fact that some cooperatives did have some shortcomings and difficulties, and the weather suddenly turned cold, therefore, the number of members attending work in many agricultural cooperatives was not large, and the preparatory work such as accumulating manure and repairing water conservancy projects was not as large in scale, as fast in progress, and as good in results as last year. The production plan and a series of technical reform targets were all set lower than last year.

In response to these situations, from late February to early March, party organizations at all levels above the township level in Guangdong Province held a series of meetings. Once again, through specific inspection and analysis, they affirmed the achievements, summarized the experiences and lessons, and encouraged cadres and peasants to brace themselves and strive for a bumper harvest this year. The grassroots cadre meetings in many counties in the Foshan and Gaoyao Special Zones also commended the cadres who had made achievements in leading cooperatives and production last year, in order to promote justice. Subsequently, cadres at all levels conducted a major inspection of spring plowing production, revised the production and technical reform targets, and promoted the "three guarantees" system of "guaranteed work, guaranteed cost, and guaranteed output." At the same time, the leading organs of Guangdong Province, various cities, special districts, and counties also mobilized more than 30,000 cadres to go to the countryside to lead production and participate in production. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangdong also sent officers and soldiers and technicians to help farmers accumulate manure and build water conservancy projects. In this way, the labor enthusiasm of the peasants in various places was rapidly increased.

### 三万多名干部下乡参加生产领导生产  广东春耕生产疲踏局面开始扭转

    三万多名干部下乡参加生产领导生产
    广东春耕生产疲踏局面开始扭转
    新华社广州13日电  广东省春耕生产的疲踏局面已经开始扭转，部分地区出现了生产高潮。目前，播种工作已经开始，潮汕平原、珠江三角洲和惠阳专区各农业社社员的出勤率都高达90％以上，其中惠阳专区出勤的人数比去年春天抗旱抢插时还多。全省积肥的数量在最近半个月内已从十二亿担增加到二十亿担，积肥较多的潮安、澄海、东莞、番禺等县平均每亩已达一万斤以上。
    在春节前后，广东省的领导机关就已发现各地的备耕工作进度迟缓，当时，曾采取措施扭转。但直到半月以前，由于不少干部和群众对去年农业合作化和技术改革的成绩仍旧估计不足，怀疑农业合作化的言论仍然没有受到有力的批判，加以有些合作社确实有些缺点和困难，天气又骤然冷起来，因此，许多农业社的社员出勤人数不多，积肥和修水利等备耕工作，规模没有去年大，进度没有去年快，成绩没有去年好。生产计划和一系列技术改革的指标都比去年订得低。
    针对这些情况，2月下旬到3月上旬，中共广东省乡以上各级党组织召开了一连串的会议，再一次通过具体检查和分析，肯定成绩，总结经验教训，鼓动干部和农民抖擞精神，争取今年农业大丰收。佛山专区和高要专区许多县的基层干部会议，还对去年在领导合作社和生产中有成就的干部加以表扬，以伸张正气。接着，各级干部进行了春耕生产大检查，重新修订生产和技术改革的指标，并且推行“包工、包成本、包产量”的“三包”制度。同时，广东省和各市、各专署、各县领导机关还动员了三万多名干部下乡领导生产，参加生产。驻广东省的人民解放军也抽出官兵和技术人员帮助农民积肥和兴修水利工程。这样，各地农民的劳动积极性迅速提高了。
