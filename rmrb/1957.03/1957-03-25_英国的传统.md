    British Traditions
　　Xu XuanSheng
    It is said that British goods are increasingly at a disadvantage in market competition. There are many reasons for this, and one of them is the conservatism and arrogance of British capitalists.
    A "London Special Dispatch" in the March 9th "Hong Kong Times" stated that the attitude of British people selling goods in foreign markets is: "Buy it or leave it." They believe that customers should already know that British goods are "the best" and there is no need for further explanation. British textiles are the most famous, and Americans appreciate them the most; however, when American importers said that Americans found the British designs of ties too dull and suggested designing some new patterns that would sell well in the United States, the British companies became furious and immediately said: "We don't want to do that kind of design!" It seems that the American insulted the "reputation" of the company. Another situation is that British cars are neither beautiful in appearance nor have unique internal parts, so if the buyer needs repairs, they must use British products; however, when Britain sells cars, it does not promote the sale of parts alongside them. Therefore, foreigners dare not risk buying British cars. If someone criticizes British cars for poor design, British car manufacturers will become furious, as they believe their products are "the best." As a result, the sales of British cars have now been seized by West Germany.
    This situation is not actually news; it is an old tradition of British capitalists. More than seventy years ago, Engels pointed out:
    "British national chauvinistic arrogance is also detrimental in business. Until recently, the ordinary British manufacturer still thought it was beneath his dignity to speak a foreign language, and was rather proud of the fact that foreign ‘poor devils’ lived in England and did the trouble of transporting English products to foreign countries for him. He never noticed that these foreigners, mostly Germans, were thus taking a large part of British foreign trade into their own hands… When, about forty years ago, Germany began in earnest to manufacture for export… the English manufacturers got frightened, and asked their ambassadors and consuls, how was it that they could not keep their customers? The answer was unanimous: (1) You don’t learn your customer’s language but expect him to learn yours; (2) You do not even try to meet your customer’s wants, habits, and tastes, but expect him to accept yours, the English ones." ("Socialism: Utopian and Scientific")
    More than a hundred years have passed, and the style of British capitalists remains the same, and there is another "German" entity among the competitors. However, after all, more than a hundred years have passed; the capitalist world market has greatly shrunk; in this world market, in addition to the "German" entity, there are also the United States and Japan, etc., participating in the competition; moreover, there is also a growing socialist camp world market… The changes in the situation are so great, but the conservatism and arrogance of British capitalists have not changed at all. This kind of "tradition" can be said to be deeply rooted.
    What is the result? One of them is "the elite move abroad, the people are shocked." According to the same dispatch in the "Hong Kong Times," the number of British people emigrating abroad has increased sharply now—especially after the Suez Canal issue occurred—and nearly half of the British people hope to emigrate. Among those who have emigrated and those who hope to emigrate, "most are well-educated and technically skilled British young men and women," which is the so-called British "elite." There are naturally many reasons for wanting to emigrate, one of which is "there is no opportunity for development in Britain, our country is too old, and we are still living the life of the eighteenth century."
    This is the fate of an old capitalist country!
    The result of arrogant conservatism is so terrible. But naturally, arrogant rashness is equally undesirable, such as in the United States.
    These are the affairs of capitalist countries, and their fundamental problems are completely unrelated to us, but some of the implications are of reference value to us, to our economic workers, and even to our theoretical workers and literary and art workers, such as the attitude towards the needs and criticisms of "customers," etc.

    英国的传统
　　徐选牲
    据说，英国商品在市场上的竞争，愈来愈处于不利的地位了。其中的原因很多，而有一条就是英国资本家的保守和自大。
    3月9日“香港时报”的一篇“伦敦特讯”中说，英国人在国外市场上推销货物的态度是：“要就买，不要就算。”他们认为顾客们早应该知道英国货“最好”，用不着多加解释。英国的纺织品最出名，美国人也最欣赏它；但是，当美国的进口商说，美国人嫌英国设计的领带太呆板，建议设计一些在美国好卖钱的新花样时，英国公司方面就发怒了，立刻说：“我们不要做那种设计！”似乎这个美国人侮辱了这家公司的“名誉”。还有一种情形是，英国的汽车，外表既不美观，内部的零件又特异，买到的人如需修理，非用英国出品不可；而英国出卖汽车时，又不附带地推销零件。因此，外国人就不敢冒险购买英国车了。如有人批评英国车设计不佳，英国汽车商就要大怒，他们认为自己的出品是“最佳”的。其结果，英国汽车的销路现在已为西德夺去了。
    这情况，其实并不是新闻了，这是英国资本家的一种古老传统。七十多年前，恩格斯就指出过：
    “英国的民族沙文主义的自大，就是在商业上也是不利的。直至最近，普通的英国厂主，还以为英国人说外国话，是失去尊严的，而且见到外国‘穷人’到英国来住家并替英国人运输生产品到外国去免得许多麻烦，于是便在某种程度内，引此自傲。他们甚至没有看到，这些外国人——其中德国人占多数——由于上述情形，夺取了英国人对外贸易的一大部分……当四十年前，德国认真开始经营输出品的生产时……英国制造家便恐慌起来，并询问英国的公使和领事：为什么他们不能保持着自己的顾客呢？答复是一致的，即：（一）你们没有学你们顾客的语言，却要求他们来学你们的语言；（二）你们不但没有设法去满足你们顾客的要求、习惯和嗜好，反而要求他们来接受你们的英国的需要、习惯和嗜好”。（“社会主义从空想到科学的发展”）
    时间隔了一百多年，英国资本家的作风如旧，而且竞争者之中又有“德”字号。然而究竟隔了一百多年了；资本主义世界市场，已经大大缩小了；在这个世界市场上，除了“德”字号，还有美国和日本等等，参加了竞争；而且，另外还有一个越来越发展的社会主义阵营的世界市场……情况的变化如此之大，而英国资本家的保守和自大，却丝毫不变。这种“传统”真可谓根深蒂固了。
    结果如何？其中之一，是“精华外移，国人震惊。”据“香港时报”的同一通讯说，现在——特别在苏伊士运河问题发生以后，英国人民向外移居的数量骤增，而且有将近半数的英国人希望外移，在外移和希望外移的人中间，“大多数是教育良好、技术高明的英国男女青年”就是所谓英国的“精华”。希望移居的理由自然很多，其中之一是“在英国没有发展的机会，我们的国家太古老了，现在仍旧过着十八世纪的生活。”
    一个古老的资本主义国家的命运就是如此！
    自大的保守的结果，就是这样可怕。但自然，自大的躁进也是同样不妙的，例如美国。
    这是资本主义国家的事情，它们的根本问题，与我们是毫不相干的，但其中有些意义，对于我们，对于我们的经济工作者，甚至于对于我们的理论工作者和文艺工作者，也有参考价值的，如对待“顾客”的需要和批评的态度等等。
