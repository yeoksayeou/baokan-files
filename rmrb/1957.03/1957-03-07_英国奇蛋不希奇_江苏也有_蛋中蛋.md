　　British Strange Egg Not So Strange
　　Jiangsu Also Has an "Egg Within an Egg"

　　(Our report) Nanjing Xinhua Daily reported on February 28th: Nanjing Agricultural College recently received a strange egg, bigger than a goose egg, with an egg inside. The egg weighed six and a half liang, and was two cun and seven fen long. The small egg inside was the same size as a normal chicken egg, weighing one liang, seven qian, and five fen. The shell of the strange egg was the same color as a normal chicken egg, and the color of the small egg was slightly darker than the larger one. Both shells were of normal thickness, and both contained egg white and yolk.

　　This egg is compared to the British "egg within an egg" (already reported on page six of this newspaper on February 26th): the weight is the same, but it is one fen longer than the British one.

　　Why do chickens lay such strange eggs? According to a preliminary analysis by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine of the Agricultural College: When the egg was about to be laid, the chicken may have suddenly been subjected to special stimuli such as fright, causing reverse peristalsis of the uterus and fallopian tubes, and the egg shrank back in. At this time, the ovary discharged another egg, and this egg moved downward along with the original egg. When the eggshell formed at the lower end of the fallopian tube, it wrapped the original egg inside, resulting in a large egg containing a small egg.

　　This strange egg was discovered in the countryside by a livestock and veterinary cadre in Yangzhong County. In order to conduct further research, the Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine of the Agricultural College is preparing to buy this chicken back.

    英国奇蛋不希奇
    江苏也有“蛋中蛋”
    本报讯　据南京新华日报2月28日载称：南京农学院最近收到一个比鹅蛋更大，蛋中还有蛋的怪鸡蛋。蛋重六两半，长二市寸七分；里边的小蛋与普通鸡蛋一样大，重一两七钱五。怪鸡蛋的蛋壳颜色与普通鸡蛋一样，小蛋的颜色比大的稍深一些，蛋壳厚薄正常，都有蛋白和蛋黄。
    这个蛋和英国的那个“蛋中蛋”（本报2月26日六版已有报道）作比较：重量一样，比英国的长了一市分。
    为什么鸡子会生这样的怪蛋呢？据农学院畜牧兽医系的初步分析：蛋快要生下时，鸡子可能突然受到惊吓等特殊刺激，引起子宫输卵管的逆蠕动，蛋重新回缩进去。这时卵巢中又排出一个卵，这个卵与原来那个蛋一齐下行，到输卵管下端，卵形成卵壳时，将原先的蛋包了进去，结果就成了大蛋包小蛋。
    这个怪蛋是扬中县一个畜牧兽医干部在农村中发现的。为了作进一步研究，农学院畜牧兽医系准备将这只鸡买回来。
