    Liu Wendian says: The lofty ideals in ancient Chinese political philosophy have been realized
    I completely agree with Premier Zhou's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries, and I especially enthusiastically support the four words "seek common ground while reserving differences" put forward since the Bandung Conference.
    I am a professor of classical literature and enjoy reading ancient philosophical books. Please allow me to say a few words from this position and perspective. Among ancient Chinese philosophical books, Lao Tzu's is universally praised by countries around the world. The essence of Lao Tzu's political philosophy, which is also the highest political ideal in ancient China, in my opinion, consists of only three phrases: "Produce without possessing," "Act without claiming," and "Lead without dominating." In the short five thousand words of the Tao Te Ching, these three phrases are repeated three or four times. In my opinion, the greatest weakness of humanity is that people always want to possess what they create and produce, and this develops into the idea of wanting to possess without wanting to work and produce. Historically, all bad political, economic, and social systems have arisen from this bad idea. Only thinkers like Lao Tzu could have the lofty ideal of "produce without possessing," and only the proletariat's Communist Party can realize this ideal.
    To take credit for a bit of achievement; to abuse power when holding great authority; this is almost human nature. To say that after accomplishing a great cause, one does not boast of one's merits, that is called success without dwelling on it, and that is a rare thing in history. Therefore, the phrase "act without claiming" is also just an ideal. As for "lead" and "dominate," in the past, people considered them the same thing. To say "lead" while "not dominating" was almost unimaginable.
    Today, the national construction and production undertakings are advancing by leaps and bounds, achieving unprecedented results. Everything is for the people, not for one party or faction. There is only creation, no monopoly. Isn't this "produce without possessing"? The Communist Party has worked hard and sacrificed for more than thirty years, and after establishing the new country, it has worked diligently to achieve today's results, without any sense of pride or complacency. It still asks the democratic parties to supervise each other. Last year, the "Eighth National Congress" was held, and the democratic parties and non-party individuals were invited to participate. Isn't this "act without claiming"? Although the Communist Party holds a leading position, all measures are very democratic and never arbitrary. Isn't this "lead without dominating"?
    In general, the lofty ideals of ancient Chinese political philosophy have been realized one by one by the Communist Party led by Chairman Mao, using the theory of Marxism-Leninism combined with the actual conditions of China. I am very fortunate and very honored to have caught up with this great era, and I am even happier to be a helper of the Communist Party as a member of the Jiusan Society. I am willing to dedicate my remaining life and all my strength to the country's socialist culture. I guarantee that under the call of the Party Central Committee for "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," I will strive to reach the international level in scientific research.

### 刘文典说：中国古代政治哲学中的崇高理想已经实现了

    刘文典说：中国古代政治哲学中的崇高理想已经实现了
    我完全同意周总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告，尤其是万隆会议以来所提出的求同存异四个字，我更是热忱拥护。
    我是一个古典文学教授，喜欢读古代哲学书，请让我以这个立场观点来说几句话。中国古代哲学书，为世界各国一致赞美的要算老子，老子政治哲学的精义，也就是中国古代最高的政治理想，据我看只有三句话，就是：“生而不有”“为而不恃”“长而不宰”。在短短的五千言中，这三句话重复了三四遍。据我看，人类最大的弱点，就是创造生产了的东西总就想占有，发展下去，就成为不想劳动生产只想占有的思想。历史上政治、经济、社会，一切不良制度，都是由这种不良思想产生的。只有老子这样的思想家，才能有“生而不有”的崇高理想，也只有无产阶级的共产党才能实现这个理想。
    有点功劳就要居功；执掌大权就要专权；这几乎是人之常情，要说做了极大的事业，毫不恃功而骄，这叫做成功不居，那是历史上稀奇的事，所以“为而不恃”这句话，也只是一个理想。至于“长”和“宰”，在从前的人看起来，就是一件事，要说“长”而同时又 “不宰”，那几乎是不能想像的。
    今天全国建设生产事业突飞猛进，取得空前的成绩，一切都是为了人民，而不是为了一党一派，只有创造，没有独占，这岂不是“生而不有”么？共产党艰苦卓绝，牺牲奋斗三十多年，建立新国家以后，兢兢业业的做出今天这样的成绩，毫无骄傲自满之意，还要请各民主党派互相监督，去年“八大”开会，邀请各民主党派以及无党无派人士参加，这岂不就是“为而不恃”么？共产党虽然居领导地位，但是一切措施都是十分民主的，决不独断独行，这岂不就是“长而不宰”么？
    总的说来，中国古代政治哲学的崇高理想，今天由毛主席领导的共产党用马列主义的理论结合中国的实际一一的实现了。我很侥幸的，很光荣的，赶上了这个大时代，更高兴的是以一个九三学社的成员来做一个共产党的助手。我愿意献出我的余生，献出我的全力，为国家社会主义文化而奋斗。保证在党中央“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的号召下，在科研工作上，努力达到国际水平。（附图片）
