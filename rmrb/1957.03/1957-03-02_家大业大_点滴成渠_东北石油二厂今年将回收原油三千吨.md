Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, March 1st. This year, workers at Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 2 will contribute an additional 3,000 tons of crude oil to the state through the recovery of scattered oil.

In the past, this factory did not pay attention to the recovery of lost crude oil. Many managers believed that "with a large enterprise and extensive operations," losing a little didn't matter. Technicians also felt that there wasn't much oil to be gained in this area, and there was no significant technical work to be done. This year, after the launch of the increased production and conservation campaign, workers conducted a thorough investigation and accounting of the crude oil that had been lost in various corners, which universally recognized the principle of "small streams make great rivers." In this year's increased production and conservation plan, the factory has listed the recovery of crude oil from various sources as one of its key components.

The gas generated in the shale oil retorts, after being washed by collection pipes, contains ash that turns into oil sludge, amounting to about 40 tons per day. In the past, this oil sludge was discarded as waste. Recent experiments have shown that one ton of oil can be extracted from every five tons of oil sludge. The factory is now constructing an oil sludge refining project. This project utilizes some idle equipment and only requires an investment of 100,000 yuan. After it goes into production in June, it is expected to refine 1,000 tons of crude oil within half a year.

When crude oil refined in the crude oil workshop is sent to the measuring tanks for heating and sedimentation, the sedimentation time is limited because the measuring tanks need to be quickly returned to service. As a result, a lot of oil is mixed in with the oil sludge and water and drained into the sewer. To reduce oil loss, engineers and technicians have conducted research and experiments and installed emulsified oil tanks in the factory. The oil sludge and water sedimented in the measuring tanks are pumped here for further heating and sedimentation. By taking this measure, more than 1,300 tons of crude oil can be recovered throughout the year. With strengthened management at the original refinery station, an additional 300 to 400 tons of crude oil can be recovered this year compared to previous years.

### 家大业大  点滴成渠  东北石油二厂今年将回收原油三千吨

    家大业大  点滴成渠
    东北石油二厂今年将回收原油三千吨
    新华社抚顺1日电  东北石油二厂职工今年将从点滴回收原油工作中多交给国家三千吨原油。
    这个工厂过去对散失的原油不注意回收，很多管理人员认为“家大”“业大”丢点没关系；技术人员也认为这方面的油水不大，没有什么技术工作好做。今年，增产节约运动开展以后，职工们将以往丢损在各个角落的原油，进行了摸底算细账，从而普遍认识了“点滴成渠”的道理。这个工厂在今年的增产节约方案里，把从各方面回收原油列为重要内容之一。
    油母页岩在干馏炉中发生的瓦斯气体，经集合管洗涤以后，其中所含的灰分变成油泥，每天有四十吨左右。过去，这些油泥都被当作废物废弃了。最近试验每五吨油泥就能炼出一吨油。现在厂内正在建设油泥炼油工程。这个工程由于利用了部分闲置设备，只需投资十万元；从6月份投入生产以后，预计在半年内就可以炼出原油一千吨。
    原油车间炼成的原油送到计量罐加温沉淀时，由于计量罐须很快回转，沉淀时间有限，有很多油夹在油泥和水里被抽到下水道流走。为了少跑一些油，工程技术人员们经过研究试验，在厂内装设了乳化油罐，把计量罐中沉淀的油泥和水抽送到这里再加温沉淀一次。采取这一措施，今年全年可收回一千三百多吨原油。原来的炼油站加强管理以后，今年也能比往年多收回原油三四百吨。
