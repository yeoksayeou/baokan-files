Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 5th (TASS): Soviet scientist Tikhov said that based on preliminary conclusions drawn from observations, it can be stated with certainty that there is plant life on Mars. However, this does not necessarily mean that this life possesses the same characteristics as life on Earth.

Tikhov is a corresponding academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In an interview published in the Soviet "Literary Gazette," he stated that the study of materials obtained from last year's observation of Mars shows that there is water vapor on Mars. The atmosphere surrounding Mars is likely composed mainly of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and trace amounts of oxygen. Good temperatures have also been found on this planet, with temperatures remaining between 10 and 25 degrees Celsius for almost six months of the year, and regular rainfall and snowfall. Therefore, Mars possesses the minimum necessary conditions for the development of plant life.

Tikhov also said that the respiration process of Martian plants relies on oxygen produced by photosynthesis, just like the respiration of marsh plants and aquatic plants on Earth. The atmosphere directly adjacent to the Martian surface contains significantly more oxygen than the upper layers of the atmosphere.

Academician Barabashov of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences also gave an interview to the "Literary Gazette." He said that some interesting materials obtained by Soviet astronomers prove that the surface of the "land" on Mars is very flat, and there are no protrusions like mountains on Earth. There are also no depressions on the "land." At the same time, it was found that the surface of the "oceans" on Mars is very uneven. This is further proof that plants may be growing in some "oceans" on Mars. Soviet astronomers observed floating clouds on the surface of Mars with speeds of 25 to 30 kilometers per hour. This confirms the existence of air currents (wind) in the Martian atmosphere. The light bands and spots on Mars, first discovered by the Kharkov Observatory in the Soviet Union last August, are caused by frost, snow, or very low fog.

### 苏联科学家根据观察的初步结论  肯定火星上有植物生命

    苏联科学家根据观察的初步结论
    肯定火星上有植物生命
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科5日讯：苏联科学家季豪夫说，根据观察所得的初步结论，可以肯定地说，火星上有植物生命。但是这绝不能说这种生命具有同地球上的生命一样的性质。
    季豪夫是苏联科学院通讯院士。他在苏联“文学报”上发表谈话说，根据对于去年观察火星时所获材料的研究，说明火星上有水气，火星周围大概是主要由氮气、二氧化碳和微量的氧气所组成的大气。在这个行星上还发现有良好的气温，一年几乎有六个月保持在摄氏十度到二十五度的温度，经常有雨雪下降。因此，火星上具备植物生命发展的起码的必要条件。
    季豪夫还说，火星植物的呼吸过程依靠由光合作用而产生的氧气来进行，这正同地球上沼泽植物和水生植物的呼吸一样。直接接近火星表面的大气层所含的氧气比大气层上层的氧气多得多。
    乌克兰科学院院士巴拉巴绍夫也在“文学报”上发表了谈话。他说，苏联天文学家得到的一些有趣的材料，证明火星上“陆地”的表面是非常平坦的，地面上没有任何像地球上山脉之类突起的东西。在“陆地”上也没有凹地。同时查明，火星上“海洋”的表面却非常不平。这是火星的某些“海洋”上可能长着植物的又一证明。苏联天文学家观察到在火星表面上有速度每小时达二十五到三十公里的浮云。这证实了在火星的大气中有气流（风）存在。去年8月在苏联哈尔科夫天文台第一次发现的火星上的光带和斑点，是由于霜、雪或者是由于很低的雾气所造成的。
