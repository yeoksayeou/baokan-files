Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese Socialist Party announced yesterday at a meeting in the House of Representatives that it demands Japan restore normal diplomatic relations with China as quickly as possible.

The Central Executive Committee of the Japanese Socialist Party passed the Socialist Party's policy towards China at a meeting held on the 2nd. The meeting also decided that a Socialist Party delegation will depart for China on March 15th. This delegation will negotiate with the Chinese government in accordance with the Socialist Party's policies.

The Socialist Party's policy stipulates that the Japanese Socialist Party delegation will study the issue of restoring diplomatic relations with China. It believes that the restoration of diplomatic relations with China should not be conditional on the abrogation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, but should promote the abrogation of these treaties.

The Socialist Party's policy points out that Taiwan is part of China, it does not recognize so-called "two Chinas," and it believes that no foreign country should interfere in the "Taiwan issue" because it is China's internal affair. However, the Socialist Party believes that the current relationship between Japan and the Chiang Kai-shek clique will continue to exist until the power of the government of the People's Republic of China extends to the Taiwan region.

The Japanese Socialist Party demands recognition of China's representation in the United Nations.

At the same time, the Japanese Socialist Party is also considering requesting that the prime ministers and foreign ministers of China and Japan hold talks to promote the rapid restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

    日本社会党中央决议指出台湾是中国一部分
    要求日本尽速同中国恢复邦交
    社会党代表团将于本月中旬来我国访问
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本社会党昨天在众议院的会议上宣布，它要求日本尽速同中国恢复正常的外交关系。
    日本社会党中央执行委员会在2日举行的会议上通过了社会党对中国的政策。会议还决定社会党代表团将于3月15日动身前往中国。这个代表团将根据社会党的政策同中国政府进行谈判。
    社会党的政策规定，日本社会党代表团将研究同中国恢复邦交的问题。它认为同中国恢复邦交不应该以废除中苏友好同盟互助条约和日美安全条约作为条件，而应推动这些条约的废除。
    社会党的政策指出，台湾是中国的一部分，它不承认所谓“两个中国”，它认为任何外国都不应当干涉“台湾问题”，因为它是中国的内政。但是，社会党认为，现在日本和蒋介石集团之间的关系将一直存在到中华人民共和国政府的势力扩展到台湾地区的时候为止。
    日本社会党要求承认中国在联合国中的代表权。
    同时，日本社会党还考虑要求中日两国总理和外交部长举行会谈，促进日中两国迅速恢复邦交。
