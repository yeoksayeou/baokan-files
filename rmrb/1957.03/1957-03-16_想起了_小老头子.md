    Thinking of the "Little Old Man"
    Wan Nianqing
    Recently, I flipped through "Gorky on Children's Literature," published by China Youth Publishing House. What attracted me most was the last part of the book: "Letters to Children." In these letters, Gorky fully expressed his meticulous care for children, which was truly touching.
    However, one letter really surprised me: in the letter to the children of a "naughty school" near Baku, Gorky finally hoped that these children would be "naughtier," and also pointed out: "When you become old men and old women, recalling this kind of naughtiness will definitely feel pleasant and funny."
    In my opinion, there are no children who are not naughty, and no children who are not naughty. Since this is the case, what is so surprising about Gorky's hope that children will be "naughtier"?
    However, I still can't help but be surprised.
    Why?
    Because since the second half of last year, I have been to some schools, contacted some children's education workers, and also heard some reports on the situation of children's education. In these occasions, almost all of them talked about such a situation: children's discipline problems are very serious. What is the reason for the serious discipline problems? Naturally, there is also such a conclusion: children are too naughty.
    This is why there are such phenomena:
    A child was always fighting with people, so the school teachers thought he was too naughty to be educated, and kept saying that they would expel the child, and even publicly threatened: "If you don't accept punishment, there are still police stations and people's courts."
    There are such teachers, and there are also such parents: not only do they beat and scold their children at home, but they also go to the school to find the teachers and say: "Teacher, please help me beat him, this child is too naughty, he won't be good if he isn't beaten."
    So, you can also see such a situation: the children in a school are really "mature beyond their years," and surprisingly well-behaved. When the teacher says a word, the children respond with a "Yes!" Naturally, they also have to stand up straight, even when they are taking a walk, as long as they hear the teacher shout, they immediately stand still, and only dare to move after the teacher finishes speaking and leaves. Naturally, the teacher will say to you with satisfaction: "The children in our school are indeed obedient, unlike the children in ordinary schools who are so naughty."
    Very naturally, there will also be such a situation: children always ask the teacher to give them more time to play football. The teacher "confiscated" the football that the children bought themselves, and said: "When you have learned your lessons well, I will return it to you to play!" The children clamored for the teacher to return it to them, and said: as long as they are allowed to play football first, they will guarantee to learn their lessons well. The teacher and the children argued, and discipline really became a problem.
    These phenomena, compared with Gorky's hope that children will be "naughtier," raise a question: how should we view children?
    Gorky hoped that children would be "naughtier," but some of us? Are afraid of children being naughty, hate children being naughty, and even take punitive measures to prevent children from being naughty.
    Gorky hoped that when children become old men and old women, they would have pleasant and funny memories of their childhood naughtiness. Some of us, on the other hand, have prematurely given children some memories that are not pleasant and are also ridiculous, making them become like old men and old women while they are still children.
    I say this not to encourage children to be as naughty as possible. I don't think Gorky meant this when he hoped that children would be "naughtier." I just want to: in the midst of the "serious discipline problem," ask everyone to pay attention to this issue together: how to treat children? Because naughtiness can be said to be a child's nature, otherwise, they are not or do not look like children. It is probably very difficult to prevent children from being naughty. It is even more of a sin to cultivate children to be like old men and old women! (Attached picture)

    想起了“小老头子”
    万年青
    最近，我翻了一下中国青年出版社出版的“高尔基论儿童文学”。最吸引我的，是书中的最后一部分：“给儿童们的信”。在这些信的字里行间，充分表现了高尔基对孩子无微不至的关怀，看了着实令人感动。
    不过，有一封信也真使我惊奇：在给巴库近郊一所“顽童学校”的孩子们写的信里，高尔基最后希望这些孩子要“更加顽皮一些”，而且还指出：“等到你们成为老头子、老太婆的时候，回忆起这种顽皮，一定会感到愉快、可笑。”
    在我看来，孩子没有不顽皮的，没有不顽皮的孩子。既然是这样，高尔基希望孩子们“更加顽皮一些”，那又有什么值得惊奇的呢？
    但是，我还是不能不感到惊奇。
    为什么呢？
    因为从去年下半年起，我到过一些学校，接触了一些儿童教育工作者，也听过一些关于儿童教育情况的汇报。在这些场合，几乎都谈到了这样一种情况；孩子的纪律问题很严重。纪律问题严重的原因在哪儿呢？自然，也就有这样一种结论：孩子太顽皮了。
    这就难怪会有这样的现象：
    有个孩子因为老跟人打架，学校的老师就认为是顽皮得不可教育，口口声声要开除这个孩子的学籍，还公开威胁说：“要是不接受处分，那还有警察派出所，还有人民法院。”
    有这样的老师，也有这样的父母：自己在家里打骂孩子不算，还跑去学校里找老师说：“老师呀，你帮我打吧，这孩子太顽皮啦，不打就是不成。”
    于是，你也就可以看到这样一种情况：有个学校的孩子，真是个个“少年老成”，规矩得惊人。老师说一句话，孩子应一句“是！”自然还得笔挺挺地立正，哪怕是在散步的时候，只要听得老师一声喊，马上也立正不动，等老师把话讲完了，走了，才敢动步。自然，老师会挺满意地对你说：“咱们学校的孩子确实听话，不像一般学校的孩子那样顽皮。”
    很自然，也会有这样一种情况：孩子老向老师要求多给他们踢小足球。老师把孩子自己买的小足球“没收”了，还说：“等功课学好了，再还给你们踢！”孩子就吵嚷着要求老师还给他们，还说：只要先让他们踢小足球，他们保证把功课学好。老师和孩子你争我嚷，纪律倒真成了问题了。
    这些现象，跟高尔基希望孩子 “更加顽皮一些”对照一下，问题就来了：要怎样看待孩子呢？
    高尔基希望孩子“更加顽皮一些”，而我们有些人呢？怕孩子顽皮，讨厌孩子顽皮，甚至采取惩罚手段，不让孩子顽皮。
    高尔基希望孩子们成为老头子、老太婆的时候，能够有对童年顽皮的愉快、可笑的回忆。我们有些人，倒过早地给了孩子一些并不愉快、而且又是哭笑不得的记忆，使他们还在童年的时候，就变得像老头子、老太婆。
    我这样说，并不是鼓励孩子越调皮越好，高尔基希望孩子要 “更加顽皮一些”，我想也不是这个意思。我只是想：在“纪律问题严重”声中，要求大家一道来重视一下这个问题：怎样对待孩子？因为顽皮可以说是孩子的天性，要不，就不是或者不像孩子。不让孩子顽皮，恐怕是很难办到的。把孩子培养得像个老头子、老太婆，那更是罪过！（附图片）
