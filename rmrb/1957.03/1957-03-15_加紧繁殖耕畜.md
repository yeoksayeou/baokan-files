    Intensify the Breeding of Draught Animals
    Chinese farmers have always paid attention to the breeding of draught animals. During the period of individual agricultural economy, draught animals were the most valuable means of production for peasant families, and many people raised female animals to breed draught animals. In 1949, there were 59.77 million draught animals in China, which increased to 87.56 million in 1956.
    However, in recent years, many regions have not paid enough attention to the breeding of draught animals, and in many places, there have also been phenomena of poor feeding management and improper use of draught animals, so the growth of draught animals has been very slow. According to statistics, in 1955, it only increased by 2.8% compared to 1954, and in 1956, it only increased by 0.2% compared to 1955. Some areas even decreased. In Shandong Province in 1956, 700,000 draught animals were slaughtered and died, but only 300,000 draught animals were bred in the same year. In Shaanxi Province in 1956, the slaughter and mortality rate of draught animals was 13%, while the breeding rate was only 12%. After offsetting the two, there was a reduction of 17,000 animals. This situation is very abnormal.
    Currently, it is the breeding season for various draught animals. Many agricultural cooperatives, in summarizing their 1956 cooperative experience and arranging this year's spring plowing production, have seriously begun to prepare for breeding draught animals. However, there are still some agricultural cooperatives that have not paid attention to this work. They do not understand that after agricultural cooperation, with the development of production, more draught animals will inevitably be needed. For example, in intensive cultivation, expanding the area of multiple cropping, carrying out land processing, and promoting various new technologies, more animal power is needed. If we do not pay attention to breeding, after a few years, the strong will become old, and the old will die, and the power of agricultural production will face great difficulties. In Zhengding County, Hebei, among the 27,121 draught animals, old animals account for 31.41%, while young animals account for only 0.93%. How serious is this problem? Xingguang Agricultural Cooperative in Qianwang Village, Fengqiu County, Henan Province, saw the importance of this problem early on, and bred a total of 261 young animals from 1955 to September 1956, and another 127 cattle will calve this spring. Mingxing Agricultural Cooperative in Lingbao County deeply realized the seriousness of the shortage of animal power by calculating the animal power, and actively took measures to breed all 232 female animals in the cooperative. This proactive spirit is worth promoting.
    Some agricultural cooperative cadres and members believe that now that we have achieved advanced cooperation, the land has become large tracts, and we will soon be using tractors, so why bother breeding draught animals? This is an unrealistic idea. China's agriculture will be mechanized in the future, but due to various limitations, the implementation of mechanization will still require a long period. At the end of 1956, China's mechanized farming area was 20 million mu, accounting for only 1.19% of the total cultivated land area. By 1962, the mechanized farming area can only reach about 10% at most. Therefore, draught animals will remain the main driving force for agricultural production for a considerable period. Even after mechanization is realized in the future, many farm tasks will still have to rely on animal power. This situation should be made clear to all cadres and farmers.
    Some agricultural cooperatives are afraid of trouble and are unwilling to breed livestock. They say that the cooperative has a thick foundation, and if we don't have enough draught animals in the future, it won't cost much to buy a few. This idea is also harmful. First, draught animals are very expensive. According to the principle of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, we should not spend a lot of money to buy draught animals, otherwise it will affect the income of the members. Second, draught animals are already lacking now, and if we don't breed them, they will be even more lacking in the future. Even if agricultural cooperatives have money, it will not be easy to buy them. Recently, many agricultural cooperatives have sent special personnel to purchase from other places, but they still cannot buy much, so it is better to breed them ourselves now.
    Correctly arranging animal power, and ensuring that breeding and use do not interfere with each other, is a practical problem that must be solved when agricultural cooperatives carry out draught animal breeding. Many agricultural cooperatives do feel the urgency of breeding draught animals, but they are afraid of delaying farm work, so they have not actively bred them. This problem should be solved, and can be solved. In Boye County, Hebei Province, more than 1,400 draught animals have been bred in recent years. At first, they also had contradictions. Because after contracting work and output to households, the production teams were afraid of losing out on farm work and were unwilling to let female animals breed. According to this situation, the county led the agricultural cooperatives to rank all draught animals for use according to the weight of farm work. Pregnant animals did light work, those about to give birth did no work, and male and non-pregnant animals did heavy work. Some agricultural cooperatives, by calculating animal power and female animals, implemented staggered breeding, and tried to arrange the calving time of female animals to the slack farming season, thus avoiding the phenomenon of a large number of female animals calving at the same time and too many calving female animals during the busy farming season, delaying farm work. Agricultural cooperatives that implement contracting work and output to households should give a certain number of labor day subsidies to the production teams for the animal labor consumed due to the calving of female animals, and at the same time, draw animal power from other teams to support them. The effect of doing so is very good. Of course, it is impossible to have no difficulties at all. But in order to cultivate reserve animal power, we should think of ways in many ways and overcome temporary difficulties.
    To do a good job in breeding draught animals, we must also implement a reward system for breeders and users. When the Dongshiyi Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Ding County, Hebei Province, started breeding, the breeders complained that it was troublesome to manage the female animals after they were pregnant, and the users were afraid that the livestock would be difficult to use after they were pregnant, so they did not breed the livestock. Later, the cooperative stipulated a method of rewarding the calving of female animals: for each small animal born, taking one year after birth as the standard, the cooperative would issue bonuses to the breeders and users. For example, for each foal born, the breeder would be awarded four yuan, and the user would be awarded two yuan; for each calf born, the breeder would be awarded one yuan and five jiao, and the user would be awarded one yuan. And from the day of birth, the breeder would be given an additional half a work point per animal per day. By the autumn of 1956, all the female animals in the cooperative had been bred, and more than 40 young animals had been born before the New Year. This method is beneficial to agricultural cooperatives, breeders, and users, and can be promoted and implemented in various places.

### 加紧繁殖耕畜

    加紧繁殖耕畜
    我国农民向来注意繁殖耕畜。在个体农业经济时期，耕畜是农民家庭最值钱的生产资料，许多人都饲养母畜繁殖耕畜。1949年我国有耕畜五千九百七十七万头，1956年发展到了八千七百五十六万头。
    但是，近年来许多地区对繁殖耕畜注意不够，并且有许多地方对耕畜饲养管理不善、使役不当的现象也发生了，所以耕畜增长很慢。据统计，1955年只比1954年增加了2.8％，1956年只比1955年增加了0.2％。部分地区甚至减少了。山东省1956年宰杀和死亡耕畜七十万头，但同年只繁殖耕畜三十万头。陕西省1956年耕畜的宰杀死亡率为13％，而繁殖率只有12％，两者相抵，减少了一万七千头。这种情况是很不正常的。
    目前正是各种耕畜配种的季节。许多农业社在总结1956年办社经验和安排今年春耕生产的时候，已经认真着手准备繁殖耕畜。但是，仍然有一部分农业社没有注意这项工作。他们不了解，农业合作化以后，随着生产的发展，必然需要更多的耕畜。例如，在精耕细作，扩大复种面积，进行土地加工和推广各种新技术等方面，都需要花费更多的畜力。如果不注意繁殖，几年之后，壮的老了，老的死了，农业生产的动力就要发生很大困难。河北正定县二万七千一百二十一头耕畜中，老畜已占31.41％，而幼畜只占0.93％，这是多么严重的问题？河南省封丘县前王村星光农业社由于很早就看到这一问题的重要性，自1955年到1956年9月共繁殖幼畜二百六十一头，还有一百二十七头牛将在今春临产。灵宝县明星农业社通过查算畜力，深切认识了畜力不足的严重性，积极采取措施，给全社二百三十二头母畜配了种。这种主动精神值得提倡。
    有些农业社干部和社员认为，现在已经高级合作化了，土地连成大片，很快就要使用拖拉机了，还繁殖耕畜做什么？这是不切实际的想法。我国农业将来要机械化，但是由于种种条件的限制，实行机械化还需要一个较长的时期。1956年底我国机耕面积二千万亩，仅占全部耕地面积的1.19％。到1962年，机耕面积顶多也只能达到10％左右。因此，耕畜在相当长时期内仍然是农业生产的主要动力。就是在将来实现了机械化以后，有许多农活也还是要依靠畜力。这种情形，应当向所有干部和农民讲清楚。
    有些农业社怕麻烦，不愿繁殖牲畜。他们说，社大家底厚，将来耕畜不够用了，买几头也花不了多少钱。这种想法也是有害的。第一、耕畜价钱很贵，按照勤俭办社的原则，就不应当花很多的钱去买耕畜，不然就要影响社员的收入。第二、耕畜现在就缺乏，如果不繁殖，以后更缺乏，就是农业社有钱，也不容易买到。最近有不少农业社派了专人到外地采购，但还是买不到多少，所以还是现在自己繁殖的好。
    正确安排畜力，做到繁殖和使役两不误，是农业社进行耕畜繁殖的时候必须注意解决的一个实际问题。许多农业社确实感觉到繁殖耕畜的迫切性，但是他们害怕耽误农活，所以没有积极繁殖。这个问题应该解决，也可以解决。河北省博野县最近几年繁殖了一千四百多头耕畜。起初，他们也有矛盾。因为包工包产以后，生产队怕误活吃亏，不愿让母畜配种。根据这种情况，该县领导各农业社按照农活轻重，将所有耕畜排队使役，孕畜干轻活，临产的不干活，公畜和非孕畜干重活。有些农业社通过算畜力，算母畜，实行分批配种，尽量把母畜生产时间安排到农闲季节，这样就避免了同时期内大批母畜临产和农忙时临产母畜过多，耽误农活的现象发生。实行包工包产的农业社，对于生产队因母畜生产而耗费的畜工应该给以一定的劳动日补贴，同时由其他队抽调畜力支援。这样做的效果很好。当然，要完全没有困难是不可能的。但是为了培育后备畜力，应该多方面想办法，克服暂时的困难。
    要做好繁殖耕畜的工作，还必须对饲养员和使役人员实行奖励制度。河北定县东市邑前进农业社开始配种的时候，饲养员嫌母畜怀驹后管理麻烦，使役人员怕牲畜怀驹后不好使用，所以不给牲畜配种。后来社里规定了奖励母畜生驹的办法：生一头小牲畜以生后一年为标准，由社发给饲养员、使役人员以奖金。例如生小驹一头，奖给饲养员四元，使役人员二元；生小牛一头，奖饲养员一元五角，使役人员一元。并且由生下之日起，每头每天给饲养员增加半个工分。到1956年秋天，全社的母畜都配了种，年前已生幼畜四十多头。这个办法对农业社、饲养员和使役人员都有利，各地可以仿照推行。
