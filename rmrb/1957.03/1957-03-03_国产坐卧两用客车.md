Xinhua News Agency dispatch: China’s first new type of seating and sleeping passenger car – a 23.6-meter all-metal open-style hard-seat passenger car – departed from the Sifang Locomotive Factory on February 28 for a long-distance test run.

The new passenger car was designed by the factory's engineering and technical personnel in the first half of last year.

The new passenger car has two layers of sleeping berths and can accommodate 58 passengers. When necessary, the luggage racks can be transformed into sleeping berths, increasing the number of beds by 29. This type of car is suitable for ventilation in the south and cold protection in the north. The car's connecting buffer device uses the No. 15 Friendship coupler, which can be connected to low or high couplers and can participate in international through transport.

    国产坐卧两用客车
    据新华社讯  我国第一辆新型坐卧两用客车——二十三点六公尺全金属开敞式硬席客车，2月28日开出四方机车厂进行了长途试车。
    新型客车是这个厂的工程技术人员在去年上半年设计出来的。
    新型客车有两层卧铺，可睡客五十八名；必要时还能把行李架变成卧铺，增加二十九个床位。这种车适合于南方通风、北方防寒的要求；车的连接缓冲装置采用的是十五号友好车钩，能同低钩或高钩连挂，可以参加国际联运。
