    Ma Zhiyao, a physician from the General Surgery Teaching and Research Group of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Beijing Medical College, began researching the use of garlic to treat surgical infections half a year ago, under the guidance of physicians Zhu Hongyin and Wang Shujuan. Through laboratory tests and numerous animal experiments, it has been confirmed that garlic has an inhibitory effect on various common pathogenic bacteria (except Pseudomonas aeruginosa) that is equal to or more significant than that of antibiotics, especially the inhibitory effect on Staphylococcus aureus hemolyticus.

    北京医学院第二附属医院外科学总论教研组马植尧医师，半年前，在朱洪荫医师和王淑娟医师的指导下，开始进行用大蒜治疗外科感染的研究，经过化验和在动物身上的多次试验，证实大蒜对各种常见致病菌的抑制作用（除去绿脓杆菌外）都和抗生素的作用相等或比抗生素的作用更明显，特别是对金黄色溶血性葡萄球菌的抑制作用最有效。
