Xinhua News Agency, Jiamusi, 10th. The newly built state-owned Jiamusi Paper Mill has been basically completed. Currently, the workers constructing the plant are working hard on the final underground pipeline construction and the finishing work on the installation of a small portion of equipment for the No. 1 paper machine. The production departments have already started production preparations. It is expected that trial production will begin in May and official handover for production will take place on July 1st.

After the Jiamusi Paper Mill goes into production, it will supply a large amount of industrial paper for cement, cables, and other industries. The maximum speed of paper production can reach 400 meters per minute, and the output of paper per hour is equivalent to 48 *li* (approximately 24 kilometers).

This factory is built in Jiamusi City, on the bank of the Songhua River in the northeast corner of the motherland, close to the Lesser Khingan Mountains forest area, which has abundant water sources and timber raw materials needed for papermaking.

This new type of paper mill, which is being built with the help of the Soviet Union, has an entire production process that is automated and mechanized, from unloading wood from trains to the log yard, to peeling, slicing, pulping, paper making, and finally loading the paper onto trains for transportation.

The factory also has waste recycling equipment. Most of the chemicals used in the manufacture of pulp are recycled and reused. In addition, there is a by-product workshop. The water used to cook wood chips and the gas emitted during cooking can be used to produce pine resin in the by-product workshop. (Attached pictures)

    佳木斯造纸厂进入最后施工
    新华社佳木斯10日电　新建国营佳木斯造纸厂已经基本建成。目前，承建这个厂的职工，正在紧张地进行最后的地下管道施工和第一号抄纸机小部分设备安装的结尾工程施工。生产部门已经进行生产准备工作。预计在5月间即可开始试生产，7月1日正式移交生产。
    佳木斯造纸厂投入生产以后，将大量供应水泥、电缆等工业用纸。它每分钟生产纸的最高速度可以达到四百公尺，一小时的出纸量就相当于四十八里路长。
    这个厂建设在祖国东北角松花江畔的佳木斯市，靠近小兴安岭林区，有着充裕的水源和木材原料供应造纸需要。
    由苏联帮助我国建设的这座新型造纸厂，从火车上把木材卸到贮木场，经过剥皮、切片、制浆、抄纸直到把纸装上火车运走，整个生产过程都是自动化机械化的。
    这个工厂还有废品回收设备。制造纸浆所使用的药品，大都是经过回收加工循环使用。另外，还设有副产品车间。蒸煮木片的水和蒸煮的时候发出的气体，经过副产品车间可以制造出松树脂。（附图片）
