　　New Directions in Soviet Economic Management Improvement
　　By Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union, Lǐ Hé
    Combining central leadership with enhancing the role of local areas is the new direction for the Soviet Union's efforts to improve economic management. This direction has been brewing for a long time. Preliminary plans were put forward at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in February of last year and at the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee in December of last year. It was finally fully determined at the February plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee this year. Many specific measures are still under study. The resolution of the February plenary session emphasized that "the organizational structure principle of industrial and construction management should be the combination of centralized state leadership with enhancing the role of local economic, party, and trade union organizations in economic management." According to the new direction, the Soviet Union will shift the focus of actual economic management to local areas and to basic economic regions.
    The new direction of the Soviet Union in improving economic management has arisen under the new situation of the great leap forward in the development of the Soviet national economy. On the one hand, the Soviet Union currently has more than 200,000 industrial enterprises and more than 100,000 construction projects, which are distributed over a vast area. Their number is so large that it is increasingly difficult for central departments far from local areas to carry out actual and specific leadership. On the other hand, due to the increasing progress of science and technology, Soviet industry and construction need to increase new departments more and more, and they need more and more specialized specialization, which makes management more complicated. This situation requires consideration: Should new management departments be continuously added in the center, or should the focus be shifted to local areas? The decision was made to take the latter path. Because this path can overcome the existing shortcomings in economic management, it can bring economic leadership closer to production, and it can attract a wider range of the working masses to manage the economy.
    In recent years, the Soviet Union has put forward a series of important measures to improve economic management. The three most noteworthy aspects are: improving the work of central planning agencies; expanding the powers of the Union Republics; and enhancing the role of local Soviets, party, and trade union organizations in economic construction. The plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee in December of last year made several specific decisions in these areas. It is not difficult to see that these measures are all centered on the principle of combining central leadership with enhancing the role of local areas. Among these measures, the issue of expanding the power of the Union Republics to manage the economy was resolved earlier and is now being implemented. Expanding the powers of the Union Republics is of great significance for improving economic management, giving play to local capabilities, implementing socialist nationality policies, and strengthening the unity of fraternal nationalities within the Soviet family.
    The Soviet Union is a multinational country. After the transformation of the Karelo-Finnish Republic into the Karelian Autonomous Republic, the Soviet Union still has fifteen Union Republics. In the administrative system, the Union (center) is followed by the Union Republics (local areas), and then by the states and districts. Therefore, in Soviet state-building, democratic centralism and the cooperative development of all nationalities are unified. The Soviet Union's Union Republics are voluntarily united; the Soviet Union's Autonomous Republics, Autonomous States, and Autonomous Regions enjoy broad autonomous rights; and the Soviet Union's nationalities freely and mutually develop their economy and culture. The friendship and prosperity of the Soviet Union's nationalities demonstrate the correctness of the socialist nationality policy. However, the management of the economy and culture of the Union Republics has been over-concentrated in the hands of the departments of the Union. The plans, finances, and leadership of the industrial, agricultural, and cultural construction of the Union Republics have been managed in too much detail by the Union agencies. The economy and culture of the Soviet Union's Union Republics have developed greatly over the years, and at the same time, each Union Republic has cultivated sufficient cadres. If the economic and cultural construction of various regions is still managed in an overly centralized manner by the departments of the Union, it will hinder the initiative of the Republics, that is, the local areas, and increase the difficulty of leadership. Therefore, in recent years, the Soviet Union has repeatedly expanded the powers of the Union Republics to manage economic and cultural construction in order to change the phenomenon of over-concentration.
    This work has had a good start. It is reflected in three aspects: First, expanding the Republic's powers in managing enterprises. In 1954 and 1955, more than 11,000 enterprises managed by the Union were transferred to the management of the Republics, including industrial sectors such as metallurgy, coal, petroleum, and timber. The Ministry of Coal Industry and the Ministry of Iron and Steel Industry were established in Ukraine; the Ministry of Non-Ferrous Metal Smelting and the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources Protection were established in Kazakhstan; and the Ministry of Petroleum Industry was established in Azerbaijan. The enterprises transferred to the management of the Republics continued to increase later, including light industry, the food industry, the automobile transportation industry, and so on. In the total industrial output value of the entire Soviet Union, the output value of industries managed by the Republics was only 31% in 1953, but it has now reached 55%. Second, expanding the Republic's powers in formulating plans. The central agencies only determine the main indicators of the national economic plan, such as: national income, total output value and commodity output value, and total investment. Many other indicators are determined by the Republics themselves. Third, expanding the Republic's powers to handle finances. For example, the budget of the Ukrainian Republic increased from 18 billion rubles in 1953 to 43.7 billion rubles in 1957.
    At the recent session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the speeches of representatives of many Union Republics demonstrated the benefits of expanding the powers of the Republics for economic development. This work is still being improved. The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Latvian Republic, Lacis, pointed out in "Party Life" in December of last year that the relationship between the Republic's enterprises and the Union's enterprises is still unclear, and there are still some areas in the Republic's production plan, material supply, and use of funds that need to be adjusted. The Economic Commission of the Nationalities Council of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (including a chairman and thirty members, with two representatives from each Union Republic) has recently been established. This specialized agency between the Republics will help to improve the national economic plan and more fully consider the needs of the Union Republics.
    Expanding the powers of the Union Republics is only one aspect of shifting the focus of actual economic management from the center to the local areas. On the other hand, in order to eliminate the phenomenon of insufficient connection between various management systems, in order to rationally use production potential, in order to effectively realize the specialization and collaboration of production, and in order to make leadership specific and flexible, the Soviet Union is studying specific measures to arrange the management of industry and construction according to basic economic regions.
    The February plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee criticized the departmentalism caused by over-concentration. "Pravda" gave examples to illustrate the harm of this departmentalism. A factory of one management department is in the south and imports steel from the Urals, while a factory of another management department is in the Urals and imports the same steel from the south, resulting in much waste. Moreover, each management department inevitably sets up many overlapping management agencies in order to lead enterprises distributed throughout the country from the center. The Soviet Union has many basic economic regions, such as the Southern Region (including Ukraine and Moldova), the Urals Region, the Western Siberian Region, the Central Asian and Kazakhstan Region, etc. These economic regions have enterprises with relatively comprehensive development and mutual cooperation. Soviet comrades believe that if the focus of actual economic management is shifted to the basic economic regions, then departmentalism can be overcome and leadership can be improved.
    The decision to shift the focus of actual economic management from the center to the local areas, as well as the decision to enhance the role of local Soviets and trade unions in economic construction, has attracted the attention of the Soviet people. The Soviet press pointed out: This is to strengthen the management principle of the socialist economy—democratic centralism, not to abolish it. Because democratic centralism is to closely unify planned centralized leadership with the socialist democracy that relies on the initiative of the broad masses. Because socialist public ownership and large-scale production require planned centralized leadership, which is realized through the state and is for the interests of the people; and socialist democracy requires the development of local initiative and attracting the broad masses to manage the state and manage the economy. These are two aspects of one thing. Developing the democratic aspect will also improve the other aspect of leadership. Therefore, Soviet comrades quoted Lenin as saying: "We uphold democratic centralism. But we must clearly know how different democratic centralism is from bureaucratic centralism on the one hand, and how different it is from anarchism on the other."

### 苏联改善经济管理的新方向

　　苏联改善经济管理的新方向
　　本报驻苏联记者　李何
    把中央的领导同提高地方的作用结合起来，这是苏联改善经济管理的新的方向。这个方向已经酝酿很久了，在去年2月苏联共产党第二十次代表大会和去年12月苏共中央全会上，已经提出一些初步方案，到今年2月苏共中央全会时，终于全面地确定了。许多具体措施还在继续研究中。二月全会的决议着重指出：“工业和建设管理的组织结构原则，应当是国家集中领导同提高地方经济、党和工会机构在经济管理中的作用相结合。”根据新的方向，苏联将把实际管理经济的重心移到地方去，移到基本的经济区去。
    苏联改善经济管理的新方向，是在苏联国民经济大踏步发展的新形势下产生的。一方面，苏联现有二十万以上工业企业和十万个以上建筑工程，它们分布在辽远广阔的领域内，它们的数量这样多，远离地方的中央部门越来越难于进行实际的具体的领导。另一方面，由于科学技术日益进步，苏联工业和建设需要越来越多地增加新部门，需要越分越细的专业化，这使管理更加复杂化了。这种形势要求考虑：是在中央不断增设新的管理部门呢，还是把重心移到地方？决定走后面一条道路。因为这条道路可以克服经济管理方面现存的种种缺点，可以使经济领导接近生产，可以吸引更广泛的劳动群众管理经济。
    最近几年来，苏联提出了一系列改进经济管理的重要措施。最受注意的有三个方面：改进中央计划机构的工作；扩大加盟共和国的权限；提高地方苏维埃、党和工会组织在经济建设中的作用。去年12月苏共中央全会在这些方面作出若干具体决定。不难看出，这些措施都是围绕着把中央的领导同提高地方的作用结合起来的方针的。在这些措施中，关于扩大加盟共和国管理经济的权限问题，解决得较早，现在开始贯彻。扩大加盟共和国的权限，对于改进经济管理，发挥地方的能力，对于贯彻社会主义的民族政策，加强苏维埃大家庭内兄弟民族的团结，都有重大意义。
    苏联是一个多民族的国家。在卡累利阿—芬兰共和国改变为卡累利阿自治共和国以后，苏联仍然有十五个加盟共和国。在行政系统上，联盟（中央）下来就是各加盟共和国（地方），再下来是州、区。所以在苏联国家建设中，民主集中制和各个民族的合作发展是统一的。苏联各个加盟共和国是自愿联合的；苏联各个自治共和国、自治州、自治县享有广泛的自治权利；苏联各个民族自由地和互助地发展着经济和文化。苏联各个民族的友好和繁荣，说明社会主义民族政策的正确。但是，加盟共和国的经济和文化的管理，曾经过分集中在联盟的部门的手里，各加盟共和国的工农业和文化建设的计划、财政和领导，都曾经被联盟机构管得太细。苏联各加盟共和国的经济和文化多年来都有巨大的发展，同时各个加盟共和国都培养出充足的干部，如果仍旧经过联盟的部门过分集中管理各地的经济和文化建设，那会妨碍共和国也就是地方的主动性，增加领导的困难。因此，最近几年来，苏联一再扩大加盟共和国管理经济和文化建设的权限，以求改变过分集中的现象。
    这方面的工作已经有良好的开端。它表现在三个方面：第一，扩大共和国在管理企业方面的权限。在1954年和1955年有一万一千多个由联盟管理的企业移交给了共和国管理，包括冶金、煤、石油、木材等等工业部门。在乌克兰设立了煤工业部、钢铁工业部；在哈萨克斯坦设立了有色金属冶炼部、地质和矿藏保护部；在阿塞拜疆设立了石油工业部。移交给共和国管理的企业后来继续增加，包括轻工业、食品工业、汽车运输工业等等。在全苏工业总产量中，共和国管理的工业的产量在1953年不过31％，现在达到55％。第二，扩大共和国在制订计划方面的权限。中央机构只决定国民经济计划的主要指标，如：国民收入、总产量和商品产量、投资总额。其他许多指标由共和国自行决定。第三，扩大共和国处理财政的权限。例如，乌克兰共和国的预算从1953年的一百八十亿卢布提高到1957年的四百三十七亿卢布。
    在最近举行的苏联最高苏维埃会议上，许多加盟共和国的代表的发言都证明了扩大共和国的权限对于发展经济的好处。这方面的工作还在改进中。拉脱维亚共和国部长会议主席拉齐斯在去年12月“党的生活”上指出，共和国的企业和联盟的企业之间的相互关系还有不明确的地方，共和国在生产计划、物资供应、资金使用方面还有某些地方需要调整。最近成立了苏联最高苏维埃民族院的经济委员会（包括一个主席和三十个委员，每个加盟共和国有两个代表参加）。这个在共和国之间的专门机构将有助于改进国民经济计划和更完善地考虑加盟共和国的需要。
    扩大加盟共和国的权限，这只是把实际管理经济的重心从中央移到地方的一个方面而已。另一方面，为了消除各个管理系统之间的联系不够密切的现象，为了合理地使用生产潜力，为了有效地实现生产的专业化和协作化，为了使领导具体和灵活，苏联正在研究按照基本的经济区来安排工业和建设的管理的具体措施。
    苏共中央二月全会批评了由于过分集中而产生的本位主义。“真理报”举例说明这种本位主义的害处。一个管理部门的工厂在南方，从乌拉尔运进了钢铁，而另一个管理部门的工厂在乌拉尔，从南方运进了同样的钢铁，这样造成许多浪费。而且每个管理部门为了从中央领导分布在全国各地的企业，不可避免地设置许多重叠的管理机构。苏联有许多基本的经济区，如南方区（包括乌克兰和摩尔达维亚），乌拉尔区、西部西伯利亚区、中亚细亚和哈萨克斯坦区等等，这些经济区有比较全面发展和互相配合的企业。苏联同志认为，如果把实际管理经济的重心移到基本的经济区，那么可以克服本位主义和改善领导。
    把实际管理经济的重心从中央移到地方的决定，以及提高地方苏维埃、工会在经济建设中的作用的决定，引起苏联人民的重视。苏联报刊指出：这是加强社会主义经济的管理原则——民主集中制而不是取消它。因为民主集中制就是把有计划的集中的领导同依靠广大群众的主动性的社会主义民主密切地统一起来的。因为社会主义的公有制和大规模的生产，要求有计划的集中的领导，这种领导是经过国家来实现的，是为了人民的利益的；而社会主义民主要求发展地方主动性，吸引广泛的群众管理国家和管理经济。这是一个事情的两个方面。发展民主的一方面，也就会改进领导的另一方面。所以，苏联同志引用列宁的话说：“我们拥护民主集中制。但要明确地知道，民主集中制，一方面和官僚主义的集中制有多么大的不同，另一方面又和无政府主义有多么大的不同。”
