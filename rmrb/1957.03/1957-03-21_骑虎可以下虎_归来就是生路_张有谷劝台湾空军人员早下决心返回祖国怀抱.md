　　During this conference, I heard Chairman Mao's speech. He told us how to understand and resolve contradictions among the people. He told us how to look at problems comprehensively. He told us how to transform all negative factors into positive ones. This was a vivid and fact-based lecture of Marxism-Leninism to educate people. After listening to it, I felt: "Hearing your words for one evening is better than reading books for ten years."

　　After listening to Premier Zhou's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries, I believe this is a significant event of historical and global importance. Since the beginning of history, whether in China or any other country in the world, it is unprecedented for a national leader to visit so many countries in such a short period and achieve such great results. Premier Zhou said, "All of this actually demonstrates the friendship of the people of these countries towards liberated China and their love for the victorious Chinese people. All the honors we have received in these countries should be attributed to our great motherland and to our great people." I believe that in addition to this, it should also be attributed to the Chinese Communist Party, to the correctness of its peaceful diplomatic policy, and to the actual impact of the great construction it has led the people of the whole country in making over the past few years.

　　Vice Premier Li's explanation of several issues concerning the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan made us understand the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan and clarified the basis for the Second Five-Year Plan - the experiences and lessons of the First Five-Year Plan. It not only filled us with confidence in the achievements of the First Five-Year Plan, but also filled us with even greater confidence in the achievements of the Second Five-Year Plan.

　　I used to be an officer in the Kuomintang Air Force. For the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, I want to say a few words to the Kuomintang air and ground crew officers in Taiwan.

　　First, let me talk about my situation:

　　In 1939, when I was in my thirties, I lost interest in flying and gave up flying skills under the pretext of doing leadership work at an aviation school. After the Kunming Uprising in 1949, I joined the People's Liberation Army Air Force and continued to do leadership work at an aviation school. However, until last winter, I still often flew aircraft for technical discussions when I thought it was necessary. What power supports me to be younger than I was twenty years ago? Spiritually, it is the socialist consciousness that supports me, and materially, it is the generous treatment and comfortable life that supports me.

　　Secondly, I want to tell my Kuomintang Air Force friends in Taiwan: when you talked to me during the Liberation War, many of you said, "It's hard to get off the tiger." "Going to Taiwan is a dead end - jumping into the sea." At that time, because I did not fully understand the policies of the Communist Party, I could not comfort you, nor could I explain it to you. Now, especially in recent years, the call of the Central People's Government, Premier Zhou's repeated speeches, and the speeches of many representative figures who used to work in the Kuomintang at the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference should make you clearly understand: it is possible to get off the tiger. In Taiwan, there is not only a dead end, but also a path to life.

　　Finally, I also want to tell you that the vast majority of you joined the Kuomintang Air Force during the War of Resistance Against Japan in order to save the country and survive. The vast majority of you are patriotic. Apart from those friends who heroically sacrificed themselves in the War of Resistance, there are still many left who were injured in the War of Resistance. You should recall the past and look at the current construction of the motherland. It is so similar to your past ideals and aspirations. Your parents, wives, brothers, relatives, and friends who remained on the mainland, as far as I know, are living very well and miss you very much. Friends! Look further ahead! Don't be confused by those deceptive nonsense anymore!

　　Where to go and what to do, make a decision early. (Attached picture)

　　骑虎可以下虎　归来就是生路
　　张有谷劝台湾空军人员早下决心返回祖国怀抱
    在这次会议上，听到了毛主席的讲话。他告诉我们怎样认识和解决人民内部的矛盾。他告诉我们怎样从全面来看问题。他告诉我们怎样把一切消极因素调动为积极因素。这是一篇生动而结合事实来教育人们的马列主义讲课。听了后我有这样一个感觉：“闻君一夕话，胜读十年书。”
    听了周总理的访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告，我认为这是具有历史意义和世界意义的一桩大事。自有史以来，无论中国也罢，世界上哪一国也罢，一个国家的领导人物用这样短的时间，访问了这样多的国家，取得了这样大的成绩，这是空前未有的。周总理说：“这一切，实际上都表现了这些国家的人民对解放了的中国的友谊，对胜利了的中国人民的热爱。我们在这些国家所得到的一切荣誉，都应该归于我们伟大的祖国，归于我们伟大的人民。”我以为除此之外，还应归功于中国共产党。归功于他的和平外交政策的正确以及他领导全国人民几年来所作的伟大建设的实际影响。
    李副总理关于第二个五年计划建议的若干问题的说明，使我们明了了第一个五年计划的执行情况，使我们清楚了第二个五年计划编制的根据——第一个五年计划的经验教训。使我们不仅对第一个五年计划的成绩充满信心，更使我们对第二个五年计划的成绩充满了更大的信心。
    我过去是国民党空军军官，为了和平解放台湾，我要向台湾的国民党空、地勤军官讲几句话。
    首先谈谈我的情况：
    我在1939年三十几岁时，就对飞行失了兴趣，借口做航校领导工作放弃了飞行技术。1949年昆明起义后，我参加了人民解放军空军部队，仍然做的是航校领导工作。但是，直到去年冬天，我还经常在自己认为有必要时驾驶飞机作技术上的研讨。这是什么力量支持我比二十年前还年青呢？精神上是社会主义的觉悟支持着我，物质上是优厚的待遇和舒适的生活支持着我。
    其次我要告诉台湾国民党空军朋友们：你们在解放战争中同我谈心的时候，好些人对我说：“骑虎难下。”“到台湾去只有死路一条——跳海。”我当时因为对共产党政策不十分了解，没法安慰你们，也没法向你们解释。现在，尤其最近这几年来，中央人民政府的号召，周总理屡次的讲话，全国政协许许多多过去在国民党做过工作的具有代表性的人物的发言，你们应该可以很清楚地了解到：骑虎可下。在台湾不仅只有死路，另外还有生路。
    最后我还要告诉你们，你们绝大多数是在抗日战争时期为了救亡图存而参加到国民党空军的。你们绝大多数是爱国的。你们除了在抗战中壮烈牺牲的那些朋友外，现在留下的还有很多在抗日战争中负过伤的。你们应该回忆一下过去，再看一看现在祖国的建设。它同你们过去的理想和抱负多么一样。你们留在大陆上的父母、妻子、兄弟、亲戚、朋友，凡是我所知道的都生活得很好，只是非常想念你们。朋友们！看远一些吧！不要再被那些欺骗人的鬼话弄迷糊了吧！
    何去何从，早下决心。（附图片）
