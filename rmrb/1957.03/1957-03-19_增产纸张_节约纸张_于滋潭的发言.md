In this Supreme State Conference, I listened to Chairman Mao's analytical report on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Explanation on Several Issues Regarding the Proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan," and Premier Zhou's "Report on Visits to Eleven Asian and European Countries" at the CPPCC conference. It was like attending three vivid lectures delivered by national leaders on how to apply Marxist-Leninist theory to address China's practical problems. Through the study and discussion of these reports, I have gained a further understanding and recognition of the Party and government's domestic and foreign policies.

Chairman Mao's speech scientifically analyzed the principles and methods for handling contradictions of different natures among the people, which made me deeply realize that while theoretically arming one's mind is important, it is even more important to be able to flexibly apply these theories. Since liberation, we have spent a considerable amount of time on political study, and we have read many classic works. We seem to understand the meaning of "When we study the particularity and relativity of contradiction, we must pay attention to the distinction between the principal and non-principal aspects of contradiction; when we study the universality and struggle of contradiction, we must pay attention to the distinction between the various forms of struggle of contradiction; otherwise, we will make mistakes," as indicated in Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction." However, why can't we apply it effectively in our daily work, leading to frequent mistakes, and why are we even more unaware of what is primary and what is secondary, what are non-antagonistic contradictions and what are antagonistic contradictions when it comes to major events at home and abroad? I think this is mainly because we have not been able to truly apply Marxist-Leninist theory to practical problems.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun gave a comprehensive and specific explanation of the proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan. This report not only made me realize that the planned development of the national economy is a concrete manifestation of the superiority of the socialist system and the only way for our country to transform from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country in a very short period, but also created extremely favorable conditions for the relevant departments to formulate the Second Five-Year Plan and its preparatory work, and increased the enthusiasm of the people throughout the country to strive to complete and over fulfill the Second Five-Year Plan. We expect that under the correct leadership of the Party and the concerted efforts of the people across the country, the Second Five-Year Plan will be completed even better than the First Five-Year Plan.

In order to further strengthen the unity of socialist countries and enhance friendship among Asian countries, Premier Zhou, on behalf of China's 600 million people, visited eleven countries, expressing our sincere wishes once again to four socialist countries and seven nationalist countries. During the visits, whether in socialist countries or in nationalist countries, our delegation was warmly received by all the people and welcomed with the most solemn ceremonies, which also attracted great attention from people all over the world. After listening to the report, I read it again word by word, and gained deeper inspiration. Therefore, when I reread Chairman Mao's "After understanding the problem of the universality and particularity of contradiction, we must further study the problem of the identity and struggle of the various aspects of contradiction" and Lenin's words quoted in the article: "Dialectics is such a doctrine: it studies how opposites can be identical, and how they become identical (how they turn into identical), – under what conditions they transform into each other, become identical, – why the human mind should not regard these opposites as dead, solidified things, but should regard them as vivid, conditional, changeable, and mutually transforming things," my understanding was different from before.

This delegation's visit not only played a significant role in the socialist fraternal countries, but also received high praise in the nationalist countries. In particular, Premier Zhou's sincere expression of willingness to learn from each other in his speeches and his firm opposition to the mistake of great-power chauvinism were unanimously praised by them. The achievements were mainly due to our Party's consistent respect for the independence of all nations, analyzing the specific situation of each country in accordance with the objective laws of social development in Marxist-Leninist theory, and providing strong support for their demands. These policies and guidelines are fully in line with the principle taught to us by the Marxist-Leninist proletarian internationalist theory that "progressive things, even if they are just budding, should be supported."

Now, let me put forward the following opinions based on my understanding of relevant issues:

First, emphasize the political study of returned overseas Chinese children.

Overseas Chinese have always loved the motherland. In the past, due to the traitorous policies of the Kuomintang reactionaries, China was in a semi-colonial position. They suffered all kinds of bullying from imperialists abroad without the support of the motherland. However, the situation is very different after liberation. Our various constructions are developing rapidly, and our international status is rising day by day. The era of being manipulated by others at will is gone forever. They feel proud to be Chinese people and love the motherland even more. In addition to actively helping the motherland carry out construction, they have also sent their children back to the motherland to study. This is a good phenomenon. However, some of the returned overseas Chinese children, due to the corruption of bourgeois ideology while abroad, pursue a life of pleasure and corruption, and do not understand the superiority of our socialist system. Therefore, they feel very unaccustomed to various facilities in our country. We should strengthen their education. If necessary, we can organize political study classes for overseas Chinese, patiently explain the government's various policies to them according to their characteristics, help them consciously recognize their previous mistakes, establish a correct outlook on life, and explain to their families abroad through them, so that they can understand the government's policies.

Second, pay attention to the physical and mental health of primary and secondary school students.

In recent years, the development of primary and secondary school education in our country has been very rapid, but it still cannot meet the needs of the people for education. In order to enable more children to go to school, most schools have adopted the two-shift system, and also rented some private houses as temporary school buildings. This measure is correct and necessary. But at the same time, we must pay attention to improving the study environment. As far as I know, the classrooms of some schools are very dark, and the students in the back cannot see the words written by the teacher on the blackboard. In addition, the classrooms of some schools use desks and chairs of the same size regardless of the height of the students. There are also some schools where there are desks and chairs of different sizes in the classroom, but because the homeroom teacher has not allocated them reasonably, the students use them arbitrarily, resulting in tall students using short desks and chairs and short students using tall desks and chairs. Primary and secondary school students are in a period of development. Living and studying in this unsuitable environment for a long time will inevitably affect their normal physical development. Now, among the students in primary and secondary schools in Beijing, nearsightedness and hunchbacks are not limited to individual schools. We hope that the relevant departments in charge of primary and secondary schools will pay attention to inspection and take necessary remedial measures as soon as possible.

Third, strengthen the promotion of paper conservation.

With the advent of the cultural learning upsurge and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, the demand for both cultural paper and household paper is increasing month by month, and the supply and demand of paper is extremely tight. In order to meet the needs of development, the Paper Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry has taken measures from many aspects. In terms of raw materials, in addition to using various reusable waste fibers, old materials, flax fleece, broken shoes, rope ends, old fishing nets, and burlap bags, last year it also used some reed grass, wheat straw, and rush grass pulp to make paper, and expanded the use of rice straw pulp to make cigarette paper. At the beginning of 1957, in order to solve the shortage of reeds, sorghum stalk pulp was trial-produced. In order to reduce the unified allocation of pulp, paper mills were also rewarded for producing self-made pulp under the condition that the supply of caustic soda was not a problem. During the paper production process, fiber loss was strictly controlled, and the lower limit of paper weight, the upper limit of moisture, ash content, paper yield, etc. were controlled. In order to reduce the pulp ratio in paper and achieve the purpose of saving pulp, the filler ratio was continuously increased without affecting the physical properties of various papers and printing requirements. For example, the ash content of coated printing paper for art publishing houses to print pictorials reaches 20%, and there is no problem in use. In addition, in order to meet the paper needs of culture, life, and industry, more than 50 new products were trial-produced in 1956.

However, through the above series of measures, although the tight supply situation of various papers has been slightly eased, due to the large gap between supply and demand of paper, it is not possible to solve the problem of paper shortage comprehensively by relying solely on the efforts of the production department. It must rely on the joint efforts of the paper-using departments to fundamentally solve the problem of paper shortage. For example, some publishing departments have a backlog of new books, and the content of various printed materials is repetitive. If publishing departments pay attention to strengthening the planning of publishing and avoid duplication of printed content, they can also save a lot of paper.

For example, cigarette paper, according to the principle of rational use of national materials, originally used new high-grade hemp pulp. In 1954, waste hemp was used instead, and in 1956, 20% rice straw pulp was used. The physical strength of the paper produced can fully meet the requirements of cigarettes. Compared with paper that does not use rice straw pulp, there are some shortcomings, such as: the transparency is slightly larger, there is a slight odor, and the ash is black after burning (the ash of cigarette paper that does not use rice straw pulp is white after burning) and does not self-ignite. Therefore, cigarette manufacturers are reluctant to use it. As far as I know, ordinary cigarette paper in the Soviet Union and other countries often does not self-ignite, is transparent, and has a slight odor. And the material foundation and living standards of their people are higher than ours and they can still use it. Why do our requirements have to be raised so high?

According to the comrades who participated in the meeting convened by the Paper Industry Bureau on February 21 this year to discuss the combustion performance of cigarette paper, a certain department had a batch of Finnish imported cigarette paper, which was returned for repulping as a papermaking raw material because of its poor combustion performance. This is very inappropriate. I think this is mainly because the publicity work is not done enough. In the future, we should vigorously explain the significance of saving to them and require state-owned factories to take the lead in using it.

Regarding the problem of insufficient supply of caustic soda: To increase paper production, we must increase pulp production. The production of pulp not only requires pulping equipment and pulping raw materials, but also requires a greater supply of chemical drugs. In 1957, the insufficient supply of caustic soda was also one of the factors affecting the increase in pulp production. In order to solve the current shortage of caustic soda supply and cultivate the growth of alkali recovery technology in the alkaline pulping of our paper industry, can we consider promoting the method of Sichuan Zhongyuan Paper Mill in 1956, which used the reverberatory furnace for producing sodium sulfide to convert it into an alkali recovery furnace, which has been successfully tested. This kind of equipment can be imitated domestically. According to the economic effect obtained from the factory's experiments, the price of each ton of pure alkali, after deducting all expenses, is more than 60% lower than that purchased on the market.

In short, increasing production and saving are two aspects of the same problem. Increasing production is of course important, but saving is equally important. Therefore, the two must be well unified in order to fundamentally resolve the contradiction between supply and demand.

This time I was able to participate in political study at the Socialist Academy, which is indeed a rare opportunity for someone like me who usually focuses on technology and pays little attention to political study. After only a few months of study, I have initially established an enthusiasm for studying political theory, and I have also gained certain gains in terms of improving my political thinking. The Socialist Academy's study system can combine the characteristics of the students and improve the students' interest in political study in a "three-self" way, which especially moved me greatly. Now I deeply realize that only by paying good attention to the study of political theory, only by arming ourselves with Marxist-Leninist philosophy, and only by applying the position, viewpoint, and method of dialectical materialism to actual work can we achieve greater progress and more achievements.

    增产纸张　节约纸张
    于滋潭的发言
    这次我在最高国务会议上听了毛主席“正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的分析报告，李富春副总理“关于第二个五年计划建议的若干问题的说明”以及周总理在政协大会上“关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告”，等于听了三次由国家领导人主讲的如何应用马列主义的理论来处理中国实际问题的最生动的讲课，通过这些报告的学习和讨论使我对党和政府执行对内和对外的政策上有了进一步的体会和认识。
    毛主席的讲话很科学地分析了处理人民内部各种性质不同矛盾的原则和方法，使我深刻地认识到理论武装自己的思想固然重要，而更重要的还在于如何能机动地运用这些理论。我们解放以来政治学习时间不算短，各种经典著作也读了不少，对于毛主席所著矛盾论中所指示的“当着我们研究矛盾的特殊性和相对性的时候，要注意矛盾和矛盾方面的主要的和非主要的区别；当着我们研究矛盾的普遍性和斗争性的时候，要注意矛盾的各种不同的斗争形式的区别；否则就要犯错误”的意义，表面上似乎也能理解，但为什么在日常工作中就不能善为应用，以致常常犯错误，对于国内外所发生的重大事件，更不知什么是主要的，什么是次要的，那些是非对抗性的矛盾，那些是对抗性的矛盾。我想这主要是我们还不能将马列主义的理论真正应用到实际的问题中去。
    李富春副总理对于第二个五年计划建议的若干问题作了全面具体的说明。这个报告不但使我认识到国民经济有计划的发展是社会主义制度优越性的具体表现，是我国要想在很短时期内从落后的农业国变成先进工业国唯一的办法，同时，也为今后各有关部门在编制第二个五年计划及其准备工作上，创立了极有利的条件，为全国人民争取完成及超额完成第二个五年计划而奋斗的热情增加了动力。我们预期在党的正确领导和全国人民的一致努力下，第二个五年计划的完成一定比第一个五年计划完成得更好。
    为了进一步加强社会主义国家的团结和增进亚洲国家间的友谊，周总理代表我国六亿人民访问了十一个国家，向四个社会主义国家和七个民族主义国家再一次表达了我们的真诚愿望。在访问期间，不论在社会主义国家中或是在民族主义国家中都赢得各国全体人民的热烈接待，都以最隆重的仪式欢迎我国的代表团，同时也引起世界各国人民极大的注意。我听了报告后，又逐字的再把报告读了一遍，得到较深的启发，因此在重阅毛主席的矛盾论中所讲的：“在懂得了矛盾的普遍性和特殊性的问题之后，我们必须进而研究矛盾诸方面的同一性和斗争性的问题。”及文中所引证列宁说的话：“辩证法是这样的一种学说：它研究对立怎样能够是同一的，又怎样成为同一的（怎样变成同一的），——在怎样的条件之下它们互相转化，成为同一的，——为什么人的头脑不应当把这些对立看作死的、凝固的东西，而应当看作生动的、有条件的、可变动的、互相转化的东西。”这一段时，体会就与以前有所不同。
    这次代表团的访问不但在社会主义兄弟国家中起了重大的作用，在各民族主义国家里也同样得到很高的评价，尤其是周总理在历次讲演中衷心表示相互学习的诚意，坚决反对大国沙文主义的错误，更得到他们一致的赞许。这些成绩的获得主要是由于我们的党一向尊重各民族的独立并遵照马列主义理论的客观社会发展的自然规律分析各个国家的具体情况，对他们的要求予以有力支持的结果，这些政策方针与马列主义无产阶级国际理论所教导我们的“进步的东西，那怕是萌芽也要予以扶植”的原则完全相符合。
    现在再让我根据自己所了解的有关问题提出下列几点意见：
    一、重视归国华侨子弟的政治学习
    国外的华侨一向是热爱祖国的。以前由于国民党反动派的卖国政策，使中国处于半殖民地的地位。他们在国外受尽帝国主义者的欺凌而得不到祖国的支持，但解放以后情况就大不同，我们的各项建设正在飞跃的发展，国际地位日益提高，随便受人摆布的时代已一去不复返，他们感到作为一个中国人民而自豪，对祖国也就更加热爱，除积极帮助祖国进行建设外，还纷纷将子弟送回祖国来学习。这是一种很好的现象。但在部分回国的华侨子弟中，由于以前在国外时受了资产阶级思想的腐蚀，追求享乐腐化的生活，不了解我国社会主义制度的优越性，因之对我国的各种设施感到很不习惯，我们应当加强对他们的教育，必要时，可组织华侨政治学习班，根据他们的特点耐心向他们解释政府的各种政策，帮助他们自觉地认识以前的错误，建立正确的人生观，并通过他们向国外的家庭进行解释，以便对政府的政策有所认识。
    二、注意中、小学生的身心健康
    近年以来我国中小学的教育发展很快，但仍不能满足人民求学的需要。为了能使更多的儿童进校读书，大多数学校都采取二部制的办法，另外还租用了部分民房作为临时的校舍，这种措施是正确的，必要的。但同时也必须注意读书环境的改善。据我了解有些学校的教室光线很暗，后面的学生看不到教师在黑板上写的字，还有的学校的教室里不论学生的身材高矮都使用一种规格的桌椅，还有些学校教室里虽然有不同规格的桌椅，但由于班主任老师未予合理分配，由学生们自己任意使用，结果出现高个学生用了矮的桌椅、矮个子的学生使用高的桌椅的现象。中小学生正在发育时期，长久在这不适宜的环境中生活学习，不可避免地会影响他们的身体的正常发育，现在北京市的中小学校学生，眼睛近视的、背驼的并不是个别学校的情形，我们希望领导中小学校的有关部门注意检查并及早采取必要的补救办法。
    三、加强节约用纸的宣传
    随着文化学习高潮的到来及人民生活不断的提高，不论在文化用纸方面或生活用纸方面的需要量都在逐月增加，纸张供求情况极为紧张。轻工业部造纸局为了满足发展的要求，曾从多方面采取措施。在原料方面除了采用各种可以利用的废纤维旧料，亚麻绒，破鞋，绳头，旧鱼网，麻袋片等之外，去年还配用部分龙须草、麦秸，和席草所制的纸浆造纸，并扩大稻草纸浆使用范围配造卷烟纸。1957年初为了解决苇子不足，试制了高粱秆纸浆。为了减少纸浆统一调配数量，还奖励各纸厂在火碱供应无问题的条件下生产自制浆。在纸张生产过程中严格控制纤维流失，掌握纸重下差，水分上差，灰分，纸张成品率等等。为了降低纸张中纸浆配比，以达到节约纸浆目的，又在不影响各种纸张物理性能和印刷上要求，不断地提高填料配比，譬如：供美术出版社印画报的胶版印刷纸，灰分达到20％使用上毫无问题，另外为了适应文化、生活和工业诸方面的用纸需要，1956年还试制了五十余种新产品。
    但通过上述一系列措施，各种纸张供应紧张局面虽稍得缓和，然而由于纸张供求悬殊，单靠生产部门努力，还不可能全面解决，必须依赖用纸张部门共同努力，才能根本解决纸张脱销问题。例如有些出版部门出版新书的积压，各种印刷资料内容的重复，如出版部门注意加强出版的计划性和避免印刷内容的重复，还可以节约很多纸张。
    又如卷烟纸，根据国家物资合理使用的原则，原来用新高级大麻制浆，1954年改用废麻，1956年配用20％稻草纸浆，制出纸张的物理强度完全可以达到卷烟要求。与不配稻草浆的纸张比较，还有一些缺点如：透明度略大，稍有气味，燃烧后灰呈黑色（不配稻草浆的卷烟纸烧后灰为白色）及不自燃等。因此卷烟制造厂都不愿意使用。据我所知道的苏联和其他国家普通卷烟纸很多都不自燃，透明，稍有气味。而它们人民的物质基础和生活水平都高于我们的犹能使用，何以我们的要求非提到这样高不可呢？
    又据本年2月21日参加造纸局召开讨论卷烟纸燃烧性能等会议的同志反映，某部门有一批芬兰进口卷烟纸，因为燃烧性不好就当了造纸原料回抄了。这是很不应该的。我认为这主要是宣传工作作的不够。今后应大力向他们解释说明节约意义，并要求国营厂带头使用。
    关于火碱供应不足问题：要想增加纸张产量，必须增加纸浆产量，而纸浆的生产不仅需要制浆设备、制浆原料，还要有更多的化学药品供应。1957年影响制浆增产，火碱供应不足也是其中因素之一。为了解决目前火碱供应不足和培育我国造纸工业碱法制浆中碱液回收技术的成长，可否考虑推广四川中元造纸厂1956年利用制硫化碱的反射炉改为碱液回收炉，已试用成功的方法。此种设备国内可以设法仿造。根据该厂试验所得经济效果，每吨纯碱扣除一切费，其价格较市面购入者低60％以上。
    总之，增产与节约是一个问题的两个方面，增加生产固然重要，节约也同样重要，因此，必须很好地将两者统一起来才能根本解决供求之间的矛盾。
    我这次能够参加社会主义学院的政治学习，对于我这样一个平素偏重技术、对政治学习注意较少的人来说，确是一个不可多得的机会。经过短短几个月的学习已经使我初步建立起学习政治理论的热情，在政治思想的提高方面也得到一定的收获。社会主义学院的学习制度能够结合学员们的特点，以“三自”的方式提高学员们政治学习的兴趣，尤其使我受到很大的感动。现在我深深认识到只有很好地重视政治理论的学习，只有用马列主义的哲学理论武装起来，将辩证唯物主义的立场、观点、方法运用到实际工作中去，才能得到更大的进步和更多的成就。
