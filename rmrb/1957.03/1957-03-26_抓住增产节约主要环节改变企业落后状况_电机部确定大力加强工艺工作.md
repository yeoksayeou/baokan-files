Xinhua News Agency, 25th Dispatch: The Ministry of Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Industry's factory director conference, which concluded here today, pointed out that the backwardness of enterprise process work has become a major obstacle for China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry to improve its technical level and unleash its potential.

The conference, which began on March 11, drafted the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Industry's production plan and measures plan for increasing production and practicing economy this year, and requested all industrial enterprises to vigorously strengthen process work this year. The conference believes that this is a key link in changing the backward state of enterprise production and completing this year's production plan and measures plan for increasing production and practicing economy.

According to the plan drafted by the conference, the total output value of the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Industry this year will increase by 16.9% compared with 1956, costs will decrease by 6.95%, labor productivity will increase by 6.1%, and 231 new types of products will be successfully trial-produced. In addition to completing the state plan, this year it is also necessary to increase production and practice economy for the state.

The conference pointed out that to complete the above tasks, it is necessary to change the backward state of enterprise process work. The main task of enterprise process work is to guide enterprises on how to carry out production, and its main content is to formulate and implement process regulations. Because this work is related to the question of what processing methods, tools, and production lines are used for production, and is related to the majority of workers mastering and applying new technologies, doing this work well can improve product quality, reduce product costs, and increase labor productivity.

However, judging from the production situation in the past year, the process work of enterprises under the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Industry has obviously lagged far behind the needs of production development.

Last year, the product quality of various enterprises was unstable. In this year, more than 5.7 million yuan was lost due to rework of defective products. The main reason for the large number of defective products is that the process regulations are not practical, or the process regulations are violated.

Many enterprises have not been able to promote advanced technical experience of great significance and still use backward production methods because they have not revised the process regulations in a timely manner, or lack advanced tools.

In many enterprises, because there are no unified advanced process regulations, workers continue to use traditional individual sets of operating methods to engage in production.

The conference believes that the reasons for the backwardness of process work are that the original foundation of the enterprise is backward, some units do not pay enough attention to this work, and there is a lack of experience. However, because the enterprises have generally established process work organizations and have gained some experience, there are conditions for doing a good job in process work.

Correctly formulating and implementing process regulations is the primary link in strengthening process work. The conference required that in formulating and revising process regulations, enterprises should absorb effective advanced technical experience from home and abroad on the one hand, and fully mobilize workers to discuss and make the process regulations more practical on the other hand.

Formulating and implementing process regulations must overcome old, irregular production methods and operating habits, which will encounter ideological obstacles. Therefore, meticulous ideological education work must be carried out.

The conference believes that strengthening the design, manufacture, and management of process equipment is of great importance to doing a good job in process work. "To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools," and process equipment is the main material condition for implementing process regulations. The conference required that various enterprises take effective measures in this regard.

In order to do a good job in process work, it is also necessary to improve the process work organizations and other technical organizations that serve production, strengthen technical inspection work, and the maintenance, upkeep, and repair work of equipment.

The conference believes that process work cannot be carried out in isolation. To do a good job in process work, it is also necessary to strengthen planning, scientific experimental research, labor wages, new product trial production, economic accounting, technical safety, and labor protection. Strengthening these tasks is also necessary to ensure the completion of this year's production plan.

The conference pointed out that strengthening process work and carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy are not contradictory. On the contrary, it is a powerful measure to complete this year's plan to increase production and practice economy.

The conference also discussed issues such as strengthening the production preparation work of new factories and improving leadership style, and formulated specific measures.

    抓住增产节约主要环节改变企业落后状况
　　电机部确定大力加强工艺工作
    新华社25日讯　今天在这里结束的电机制造工业部厂长会议指出，企业工艺工作落后已经成为我国电机制造工业提高技术水平、发挥企业潜力的重大障碍。
    这个在3月11日开始举行的会议，拟订了电机制造工业部今年的生产计划和增产节约措施计划，并且要求各工业企业在今年大力加强工艺工作。会议认为这是改变企业生产的落后状况、完成今年生产计划和增产节约措施计划的一个主要的环节。
    按照会议拟订的计划，电机制造工业部今年的生产总值将比1956年增长16.9％，成本降低6.95％，劳动生产率提高6.1％，试制成功新种类产品二百三十一种。在完成国家计划以外，今年还要为国家增产节约一笔财富。
    会议指出，要完成上述任务，必须改变企业工艺工作落后的状况。企业的工艺工作的主要任务是指导企业怎样进行生产，它的主要内容是制定和贯彻工艺规程。由于这一工作关系到用什么样的加工方法、工具和生产路线进行生产的问题，关系到广大工人掌握和运用新技术的问题，因此做好这一工作，就可以提高产品质量，降低产品成本，提高劳动生产率。
    但是从过去一年来的生产情况来看，电机制造工业部所属企业工艺工作显然大大落后于生产发展的需要。
    去年各企业的产品质量不稳定。这一年，由于废品返工损失五百七十多万元。而废品多的主要原因，是工艺规程不切合实际，或违犯了工艺规程。
    不少企业由于没有及时修订工艺规程，或缺少先进的工具，以致许多有重大意义的先进技术经验不能推广，而仍然采用落后的生产方法。
    在许多企业里，因为没有统一的先进的工艺规程，工人们沿用着传统的各自一套的操作方法来从事生产。
    会议认为，工艺工作落后的原因，是企业原有基础落后，有些单位对这一工作不够重视，以及经验不足。但是由于各企业已经普遍建立了工艺工作机构，并且取得了一些经验，因而做好工艺工作是有条件的。
    正确地制定和贯彻工艺规程，是加强工艺工作的首要环节。会议要求各企业在制定和修订工艺规程中，一方面要吸收国内外行之有效的先进技术经验，另方面要发动职工群众充分讨论，使工艺规程更加切合实际。
    制定和贯彻工艺规程，必须克服旧的不正规的生产方法和操作习惯，这会遇到思想上的阻碍。因此必须进行细致的思想教育工作。
    会议认为加强工艺装备的设计、制造和管理工作，对做好工艺工作有极大的重要性。“工欲善其事，必先利其器”，工艺装备是贯彻工艺规程的主要物质条件。会议要求各企业在这方面采取有效措施。
    为了做好工艺工作，还必须健全工艺工作机构和为生产服务的其他技术机构，加强技术检查工作和设备的维护、保养、修理工作。
    会议认为，工艺工作不能孤立地进行。要做好工艺工作，还要加强计划、科学试验研究、劳动工资、新产品试制、经济核算、技术安全劳动保护等项工作。加强这些工作也是保证完成今年的生产计划所必需的。
    会议指出，加强工艺工作和开展增产节约运动并不矛盾，相反地，它是完成今年的增产节约计划的一项有力的措施。
    这次会议对加强新厂的生产准备工作、改进领导作风等问题，也作了讨论，并且拟订了具体措施。
