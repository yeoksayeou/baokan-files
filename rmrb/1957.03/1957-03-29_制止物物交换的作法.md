　　Measures to Stop Barter Trade
    Currently, some commercial units are engaging in a so-called "adjustment" trend of barter trade. In November of last year, the Liuzhou Purchasing Station of the Guangxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative sent purchasing agents to Wuhan to purchase apples, lotus seeds, and black melon seeds. The Wuhan Supply and Marketing Cooperative had these goods, but they wanted the Liuzhou Purchasing Station to exchange them for dried lychees, longan fruit, and kumquats. Recently, the Liuzhou Purchasing Station sent people to the Zhanjiang Fruit Station in Guangdong to purchase bananas. They also wanted to exchange goods, otherwise they would not sell them.

    I believe that this phenomenon of barter trade is abnormal. If the buyer really doesn't have surplus goods to exchange, they can only watch the goods go out of stock, and the other party will also create a backlog as a result. Secondly, in order to have sufficient materials for exchange, various commercial units will inevitably blindly rush to purchase and stockpile some surplus materials that are not needed locally, thereby artificially hindering the exchange of materials and fueling the situation of tight supply. It is hoped that the responsible departments of state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives will take effective measures to stop this phenomenon.    Fang Yang

　　制止物物交换的作法
    目前有一些商业单位盛行着物物交换的所谓“调剂”之风。去年11月，广西省供销合作社柳州采购站派了采购员到武汉市去采购苹果、莲子、黑瓜子，武汉市供销社有这些货，但是，要柳州采购站用荔枝干、桂元果、金桔去交换。最近，柳州采购站又派人到广东湛江水果站去采购香蕉，他们也要用东西去交换，否则不卖给。
    我认为这种物物交换的现象是不正常的。这样作，如果买方确实没有多余的货物可以去交换，就只好坐视脱销，而对方也会因此造成积压。其次，各商业单位为了使自己有足够的物资可以去交换，势必要盲目抢购，和储备一部分当地并不需要的多余物资，因而人为地阻碍了物资交流，助长了供应紧张的情况。希望国营商业和供销社等主管部门对这种现象采取有效措施加以制止。    方扬
