Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 24th. Premier Viliam Široký, speaking at a welcoming rally held this afternoon at the Shanghai Cultural Square, said that the Czechoslovak people, because the people's cause has already been victorious in the vast area from the westernmost part of the Czechoslovak Republic all the way to Shanghai, have shouted with boundless joy the slogan: "Today from Ash to Shanghai, red flags flutter everywhere." (Editor's note: Ash is a city on the western border of the Czechoslovak Republic)

In his speech, Premier Široký traced the deep sympathy of the Czechoslovak people for the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, and spoke of the great significance of further consolidating and strengthening the unity of the socialist camp. He praised China's great efforts in this regard. Premier Široký said that when international imperialism is launching a frenzied attack on the socialist camp and on the liberation movements of the peoples of Asia and Africa, the People's Republic of China has made a significant contribution to repelling and crushing all these attacks.

Premier Široký's speech was greeted with enthusiastic applause from the audience. As he concluded his remarks, the more than 13,000 people participating in the welcome rally all stood up and applauded and cheered him for a long time.

Premier Široký and all members of the delegation, accompanied by Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council, Huang Jing, Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, Cao Ying, Chinese Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, and others, attended the meeting. Cao Diqiu, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, delivered a speech at the beginning of the meeting, expressing warm respect on behalf of all the people of Shanghai to the distinguished guests and the people of Czechoslovakia. He said: In many factories in Shanghai, many Czechoslovak experts are working hard to help us build. They patiently teach their skills to our engineers, technicians, and workers. The first group of tractor drivers at the tractor station in the suburbs of Shanghai were trained with the help of Czechoslovak experts. The first 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine and 12,000-kilowatt steam turbine in China, which Shanghai people are most familiar with and proud of, were also designed and manufactured with the sincere help of Czechoslovak experts. The workers call these steam turbines "flowers of Sino-Czech friendship" because they reflect the deep friendship between the people of China and Czechoslovakia.

After Premier Široký's speech, Shanghai artists performed dances and Peking opera for the distinguished guests.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 24th. The Czechoslovak government delegation continued its tour of Shanghai today.

Premier Široký visited the Shanghai Turbine Factory, China's first turbine manufacturing plant, in the morning. On the balcony of the office building, Premier Široký delivered a speech to the gathered employees. He congratulated the employees on their great achievements in establishing China's turbine industry. He said: "We are delighted that the Chinese working class can correctly solve the problem of industrialization, and seeing the tenacious and capable spirit of the Chinese workers, we are even more convinced that the great cause of China's socialist industrialization will surely be successfully realized."

In the evening, Premier Široký and members of the delegation visited the largest joint state-private cotton textile factory in China, the Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Textile Factory. Premier Široký listened to a detailed introduction by Wu Zhongyi, the private factory director. He was very interested in issues such as the socialist transformation of capitalist enterprises, the relationship between public and private sectors in joint state-private enterprises, and the personal transformation of capitalists.

　　从阿士到上海　红旗到处飘扬
　　西罗基总理在上海谈人民事业的发展
    据新华社上海24日电　威廉·西罗基总理今天下午在上海文化广场举行的欢迎大会上发表讲演说，捷克斯洛伐克人民因为人民的事业已经在从捷克斯洛伐克共和国最西部一直到上海的广大地区内获得了胜利，曾经无限欢欣地喊出这样的口号：“今天从阿士城到上海，红旗已到处飘扬”。（编者注：阿士城是捷克斯洛伐克共和国西部边境的一个城市）
    西罗基总理在讲话中追溯了捷克斯洛伐克人民对中国人民革命斗争的深厚同情，并且谈到了进一步巩固和加强社会主义阵营团结的重大意义。他赞扬中国在这一方面所做的巨大努力。西罗基总理说，当国际帝国主义对社会主义阵营和对亚非各民族人民的解放运动进行疯狂进攻时，中华人民共和国对击退和粉碎这一切进攻作了重大贡献。
    西罗基总理的讲话博得了全场多次热烈的掌声（讲话全文见本报今日第四版）。当他讲话结束时，参加欢迎大会的一万三千多人全体站起来向他长时间地鼓掌欢呼。
    西罗基总理和代表团全体团员由国务院秘书长习仲勋、第一机械工业部部长黄敬、中国驻捷克斯洛伐克大使曹瑛等陪同出席了大会。上海市副市长曹荻秋在大会开始时致词，代表全上海人民向贵宾们和捷克斯洛伐克人民表示热烈的敬意。他说：在上海的许多工厂里，有很多捷克斯洛伐克专家在辛勤地帮助我们建设。他们把自己的本领耐心地教给我们的工程师、技术人员和工人。上海郊区的拖拉机站的第一批拖拉机手，是在捷克斯洛伐克专家们的帮助下训练成长起来的。上海人民最熟悉的和引以为荣的中国第一台六千瓩汽轮机和一万二千瓩汽轮机，也是在捷克斯洛伐克专家们的真诚帮助下设计制造成功的。工人们把这些汽轮机称为“中捷友谊之花”，因为它反映了中捷两国人民的深厚友情。
    在西罗基总理讲话后，上海艺术家为贵宾们表演了舞蹈和京剧。
    据新华社上海24日电　捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团今天在上海继续参观访问。
    西罗基总理上午参观了中国第一个制造汽轮机的工厂——上海汽轮机厂。在办公大楼的阳台上，西罗基总理对群集欢迎的职工们发表了演说。他祝贺职工们在建立中国的汽轮机工业方面所获得的巨大成就。他说：“我们为中国工人阶级能够正确解决工业化问题而感到欢欣鼓舞，看到了中国工人顽强、能干的精神，我们更加相信，中国的社会主义工业化的伟大事业，一定能够胜利实现。”
    西罗基总理和代表团团员们在傍晚访问了中国最大的公私合营棉纺织厂——申新第九棉纺织厂。西罗基总理听了私方厂长吴中一的详细介绍，他对资本主义企业的社会主义改造和公私合营企业里的公私共事关系、资本家的个人改造等问题感到很大兴趣。
