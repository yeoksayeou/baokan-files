Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 3rd. The preliminary plan for the television station and television transmitter designed for China by the Soviet Postal and Telecommunications Design Institute has recently been completed. This plan will be sent to Beijing for review in March of this year.

According to this plan, the television station will be able to broadcast two programs simultaneously, and will also be able to add color programs in the future.

Before carrying out the design, the director of the Postal and Telecommunications Design Institute, Stoyanof, personally led a survey team to Beijing last year to conduct on-the-spot surveys and collect design data.

    苏联为我设计的方案已经完成
    新华社莫斯科3日电  苏联邮电设计院为中国设计的电视台和电视发射机的初步方案最近已经完成。这个方案今年3月间将送到北京来审查。
    根据这个方案，电视台能够同时播送两个节目，而且将来还可以增加彩色节目。
    邮电设计院在进行设计之前，设计院院长斯达扬诺夫曾经在去年亲自领导一个勘察组到北京进行实地勘察，收集设计资料。
