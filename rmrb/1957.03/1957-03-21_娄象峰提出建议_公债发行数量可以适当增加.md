Lou Xiangfeng made a suggestion
The amount of government bond issuance can be appropriately increased
    I fully agree with and support the various reports of the conference. Now I would like to express some superficial opinions on the following issues.

    I. The issue of appropriately increasing the amount of government bonds issued
    Since the issuance of government bonds in China in 1950, it has played a significant role in China's economic recovery and development and in stabilizing prices. The national economic construction bonds from 1954 to 1956 accounted for one-fourteenth to one-twenty-third of China's industrial construction investment, specifically illustrating its important role.

    I believe that it is necessary to appropriately increase the issuance of our economic construction bonds in the future. The reasons are as follows: First, we took over the mess left by old China. In the past seven years, we have achieved unprecedented achievements from economic recovery to economic construction. However, whether in the economic or cultural and scientific fields, although the development speed is very fast, we are still very backward compared with advanced countries. Therefore, we demand to catch up as quickly as possible, but our capital accumulation is limited, which creates a contradiction. Issuing government bonds is one of the important methods of accumulating construction funds. Under possible conditions, issuing some more government bonds will develop economic and cultural construction faster and shorten the time to catch up with advanced countries. Second, in recent years, with the development of production and the victory of the socialist revolution, the living standards of the broad masses of people have generally improved, but this has brought pressure to the market. The reason is that although our country generally has a low-wage system, wages in hand are neither used to buy land nor to build houses, so most of them are invested in the consumer market for daily life. In addition, even people with low incomes are not afraid of unemployment and do not worry about birth, old age, sickness, and death, so they lack the idea of reserves. Even if there is not much money, they use it today and expect a better year next year. The broad masses of farmers, also due to the superiority of cooperation, see a beautiful and happy future. This class, which is the most adept at keeping reserves and has the largest number of people, has also undergone a change in their idea of reserves. As a result, the market supply is tight. As the saying goes, "When the people are rich, the country is rich." I say, "When the people have reserves, the country has reserves." Under these circumstances, advocating patriotic savings is one method, but many people are not accustomed to saving and have problems with their understanding. The ideological foundation for subscribing to government bonds is deeper and more solid than patriotic savings. Therefore, on the basis of propaganda and education to improve thinking, appropriately increasing the issuance of government bonds is also beneficial to alleviating the tight market supply. Third, due to the increase in wages and income of the broad masses of workers and peasants, the lack of reserve thinking, and the lack of comprehensive propaganda and education, focusing more on the beautiful prospects and not promoting the fine tradition of hard work and thrift enough, the idea of luxury and waste has grown, and corruption has occurred. Although this situation is individual, it exists everywhere. This should belong to the issue of socialist morality and can be solved through propaganda and education. However, on the basis of promoting increased production and thrift, appropriately increasing the issuance of government bonds is also of great benefit to establishing socialist thinking, maintaining the fine tradition of hard work and thrift, and correcting the luxurious and extravagant thinking of some people.

    Based on the above situation, I believe that it is very necessary to appropriately increase the issuance of some government bonds after 1958. Is it possible? I think it is possible. First of all, our production continues to develop, and workers' wages continue to increase. This year, on the basis of last year, they have generally increased, and next year will still be higher than this year. As wages increase, the power to subscribe to government bonds also increases. Secondly, if China's agricultural production has a bumper harvest in 1957, the national income will greatly increase. Even if some disasters are unavoidable, due to the great superiority of cooperation and the continued consolidation and development of cooperation, and due to a series of effective measures taken from top to bottom, the increase in agricultural production on the basis of 1956 is also relatively certain. Again, the principal and interest repayments for the issuance of government bonds from 1954 to 1957 will be approximately 200 million yuan in 1958. This part of the force cannot be allowed to go its own way. If, through the extensive and in-depth development of the movement to increase production and practice thrift, and on the basis of the masses' increased socialist awareness, a portion of the principal and interest repayments is estimated to be a reliable force for subscribing to government bonds.

    II. Birth Control and Comprehensive Publicity of the Marriage Law

    Birth control has now become the demand of the broad masses of the people. The government has also paid more attention to this issue and taken various specific measures to strengthen guidance. This is a very important and complex issue. Some people believe that in addition to contraception and other methods, it is also necessary to consider revising the marriage age stipulated in the Marriage Law. My view on this issue is as follows: The custom of early marriage left over from history has caused great harm to our nation. Since the promulgation of the Marriage Law in 1950, it has played a huge role in changing China's custom of early marriage. However, after the promulgation of the Marriage Law, the publicity about the marriage age is sometimes not comprehensive enough. The masses also have problems with their understanding. Article 4 of the Marriage Law stipulates: "Men must be 20 years old and women must be 18 years old to get married." This means that in the past, those who married before the age of 20 for men and 18 for women were not allowed after the promulgation of the Marriage Law. But does it mean that men must marry at 20 and women must marry at 18? Absolutely not. Men at 20 and women at 18 are the minimum age for marriage, but it does not mean that it is the most suitable age for marriage. Due to the influence of the custom of early marriage left over from history, and also due to our incomplete publicity of the Marriage Law, many people interpret the minimum marriage age stipulated in the Marriage Law as the natural marriage age. People often mention that men are 20 and women are 18 and have reached the marriage age, and it even seems that men at 20 and women at 18 will miss their youth if they do not marry. In the future, we must fully publicize the Marriage Law in the further implementation of the Marriage Law, stating that the marriage age stipulated in the Marriage Law is the minimum marriage age, taking into account the custom of early marriage left over from history. Young men and women and parents should not misunderstand it as the natural marriage age. The Marriage Law absolutely does not advocate early marriage.

    Ten years ago, I conducted a survey on more than one hundred young students in a middle school on several aspects of marriage issues. Among them, regarding the issue of marriage age, the majority (regardless of gender) agreed to marry around the age of 25. It can be seen that young intellectuals do not approve of marrying too early. So my opinion is to first comprehensively publicize the Marriage Law and change the masses' one-sided interpretation. Then, does the provision of the minimum marriage age in Article 4 of the Marriage Law need to be revised? My opinion is that it should be revised, but not immediately. First, we should carry out publicity and mobilize the broad masses, especially young people, to discuss and recognize the harm of early marriage. After there is an ideological foundation and social foundation, that is, when the conditions are ripe, we will revise it. How to revise it? My opinion is that the minimum marriage age should not be uniform across the country, because China is large, the situation is complex, the nationalities are different, the regions are different, and there can be differences between the mainland and the coast, and between cities and rural areas. Each province, city, and autonomous region can formulate supplementary rules for the implementation of the Marriage Law based on specific conditions, with more specific provisions for the local minimum marriage age that is neither too low nor unacceptable to the masses. After key trials, it should be reported to the central government for approval and implementation.

    III. Improving the Publicly Funded Healthcare System

    The publicly funded healthcare system is a very good system, which is related to the health of the broad masses of workers and the enthusiasm for building socialism. However, there are still shortcomings in our implementation of this system. The most prominent one is the waste of medicine. In the next few years, our medical staff and medicines cannot meet the growing needs of the people. The waste phenomenon in publicly funded healthcare has increased the pressure on medicine. This is certainly a socialist moral issue, but in addition to strengthening the propaganda and education work of cultivating socialist morality, we must also think of some ways from the system. The application of this system in our country will become more and more widespread, and it is even more necessary to summarize experience and improve it. The establishment of socialist morality takes a certain amount of time. My personal opinion is that a fraction of the cost of medicine should be directly borne by individuals in publicly funded healthcare. If one wastes a few public resources, one should directly bear one of them. This is a vivid example of combining personal interests with collective interests, caring about the waste of medicine from the perspective of direct personal interests. Does this reduce the welfare of workers? No, the proportion of personal burden in the medical treatment of workers' families can be reduced. In this way, it is not reduced overall, but it can greatly avoid the waste of medicine. For example, in publicly funded healthcare, few people pay attention to returning used medicine bottles under the condition of no charge, but if a small deposit is charged, most of the medicine bottles will be returned, and the virtue of cherishing materials can also be brought into play, which is consistent with the cultivation of socialist morality.

    The above issues cannot be carried out independently by local areas. I submit them for the central government's reference. Please give guidance on any one-sided and superficial points. (Attached picture)

### 娄象峰提出建议　公债发行数量可以适当增加

1957-03-21

专栏：

　　娄象峰提出建议
　　公债发行数量可以适当增加
    大会的各项报告，我完全同意并拥护。现在我想就下面几个问题发表一些粗浅的意见。
    一、适当增发公债数量问题
    我国自1950年发行公债以来，对我国经济恢复发展与稳定物价各方面起了显著作用。1954到1956年的国民经济建设公债，分别占我国工业建设投资的十四分之一到二十三分之一，具体说明了它的重要作用。
    我认为今后我们的经济建设公债的发行量有适当增加的必要。其理由如下：第一，我们接收旧中国的烂摊子，七年来我们由经济恢复到经济建设取得了历史上从来没有过的成就。但无论在经济方面或文化科学方面，虽然发展速度很大，但和先进国家比较我们还是很落后的。因之我们就要求尽可能快的赶上去，而我们的资金积累是有限制的，这就发生了矛盾。发行公债是积累建设资金的重要方法之一，在可能条件下，增发一些公债，会更快的发展经济文化建设，缩短赶上先进国家的时间。第二，几年来随着生产的发展和社会主义革命的胜利，广大人民的生活普遍有所提高，但这就给市场带来了压力。原因是虽然我们国家一般是低工资制，但工资到手，既不买地，也很少盖房，于是大部投入日常生活上的消费市场，加以纵然收入不多的人，因既不怕失业，也不虑生、老、病、死，因之缺乏后备思想。钱虽不多，今朝有钱今朝用，明年更比今年强。广大的农民，也由于合作化的优越性，看到美丽幸福的远景，这个最善于留后备的人数最多的阶级，后备思想也发生了变化。于是市场供应紧张了。常言道：“民富国才富”，我说：“民有后备，国才有后备。”在这种情况下提倡爱国储蓄是一个方法，但许多人对储蓄不习惯，认识上也有毛病。而认购公债的思想基础比爱国储蓄更深广和巩固。因之在宣传教育提高思想的基础上，适当增发公债，对缓和市场供应紧张局面也有好处。第三，由于广大工农工资和收入的提高，由于缺乏后备思想，也由于宣传教育工作不全面，看美丽前景多，艰苦朴素的优良传统发扬不够，奢侈浪费思想有所滋长，贪污现象又有发生，这种情况虽然是个别的，但各地都有。这应该属于社会主义道德问题，可以从宣传教育方面解决，但在宣传增产节约的基础上，适当增发一些公债，对树立社会主义思想，保持艰苦朴素的优良作风，纠正部分人的奢侈浮华思想，也是大有好处的。
    根据以上情况，我认为在1958年以后，适当增发一些公债是很有必要的。是否可能呢？我认为是可能的。首先我们的生产继续发展，职工工资是继续增加的，今年在去年的基础上，总的来说还是增加的，明年比今年还是有增加的，工资增加，认购公债的力量也随着增加。其次，我国农业生产在1957年如果来个大丰收，那么国民收入将大有增加，即使还不免有些灾害，由于合作化的巨大优越性和合作化的继续巩固与发展，又由于从上到下采取了一系列的有效措施，在1956年的基础上，农业生产的增加，也是比较有把握的。再次，自1954年到1957年四年来发行公债的还本付息，在1958年的数目约两亿元左右，对这一部分力量不能听其自流，如果经过广泛深入的增产节约运动的开展，在群众社会主义觉悟提高的基础上，把还本付息的一部分，估计到认购公债的力量中也是可靠的。
    二、节制生育与全面宣传婚姻法问题
    节制生育目前已成为广大人民的要求，政府也更加注意了这一问题，并采取各种具体措施加强指导。这是个很重要也很复杂的问题。有人认为除了避孕等方法以外还要考虑修改婚姻法所规定的结婚年龄问题。我对这个问题的看法是这样的：历史上遗留下来的早婚习惯，给我们的民族以极大危害，自1950年颁布婚姻法以后，对改变我国的早婚习惯起了巨大作用。但婚姻法颁布后，关于结婚年龄的宣传有时是不够全面的。群众领会也有毛病。婚姻法第四条规定：“男二十岁，女十八岁，始得结婚”。这意思就是说，过去男不满二十岁女不满十八岁就结婚的，在婚姻法颁布后就不许可了。但是否男满了二十岁女满了十八岁就一定要结婚呢？绝不是的，男二十岁，女十八岁这是结婚的最低年龄，但并不等于说是最合适的结婚年龄。由于历史上遗留下来的早婚习惯的影响，也由于我们宣传婚姻法不全面，许多人把婚姻法规定的最低限度的结婚年龄解释成为当然的结婚年龄，常常有人提到男二十岁女十八岁了到了结婚年龄了，甚至好像男二十岁女十八岁要不结婚，就有些误了青春似的。今后我们必须在进一步贯彻婚姻法当中，全面宣传婚姻法规定的结婚年龄是最低的结婚年龄，是考虑到历史上遗留下来的早婚习惯的。青年男女以及家长不要误解为当然的结婚年龄，婚姻法绝不是提倡早婚。
    十年以前，我在一个中等学校里就婚姻问题的几个方面向一百多个青年学生进行过一次调查，其中关于结婚年龄问题，大多数（未分男女）赞成在二十五岁左右结婚。可见在知识青年中是不赞成过早结婚的。所以我的意见，首先全面宣传婚姻法，改变群众的片面解释。那么婚姻法第四条最低结婚年龄的规定是否需要修改呢？我的意见要修改，但不马上修改，先进行宣传，发动广大的群众尤其是青年讨论，认识早婚之害，等到有了思想基础和社会基础，也就是条件成熟了再修改。如何修改呢？我的意见是在最低限度结婚年龄上不要求全国一律，因我国地方大，情况复杂，民族不同，地区不同，内地与沿海，城市与农村可以有差别，由各省、市、自治区根据具体条件，制定执行婚姻法的补充章则，比较具体的规定适合当地的最低限度的结婚年龄，既不太低，群众也能接受，经过重点试行，报请中央批准施行。
    三、改进公费医疗制度问题
    公费医疗制度是很好的制度，关系到广大职工的健康和建设社会主义的积极性。但我们执行这个制度当中，还存有缺点，最突出的就是医药方面的浪费，今后若干年内，我们的医务工作人员和药品是不能满足人民日益增长的需要的，公费医疗上的浪费现象增加了对医药的压力，这固然是个社会主义道德问题，但我们除了加强培养社会主义道德的宣传教育工作以外，还必须从制度上想些办法。这个制度在我国的应用，将越来越广泛，总结经验，加以改进，就更有必要。社会主义道德的树立是要一定时间的。我个人意见，在公费医疗上对药品要收若干分之一的费用由个人直接负担，要浪费了公家若干个，其中由他个人直接负担一个。从个人直接利益上关心医药的浪费，这是个人利益和集体利益结合的生动实例。这样不是降低了职工的福利吗？不，可以把职工家属医疗中个人负担的比重降低，这样从总的来说还不是降低，但可以大大避免医药浪费。例如在公费医疗中，用过的药瓶，在不收费的条件下，很少人注意往回送，但收很少的押金，就大都把药瓶送回了，爱惜物力的美德也就能够发挥了，这和社会主义道德的培养是一致的。
    以上几个问题，都不是地方上能够单独进行的，我提出供中央参考，片面粗浅之处，请予指教。（附图片）
