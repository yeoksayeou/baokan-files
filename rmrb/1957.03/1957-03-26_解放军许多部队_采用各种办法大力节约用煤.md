Xinhua News Agency, March 25th: Many units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are adopting various methods to vigorously save coal.

　　A certain unit of the Shenyang Garrison adopted the method of appropriately and reasonably merging offices and dormitories, reducing nineteen large stoves and saving the country more than 53,900 jin of coal. This unit also modified about forty stoves, reducing the depth and diameter of the stoves, which also saved a lot of coal. A certain unit of the Jinan Garrison promoted the "Horseshoe Reversing Dragon Stove" created by cook Long Shaocheng and the "Water Boiler Steaming Mantou" method created by cook squad leader Zhao Qiguang. In the past six months, they have saved more than 590,000 jin of coal. The main feature of the "Horseshoe Reversing Dragon Stove" is that the bottom of the stove is small and short, the flame is concentrated, and the coal can be completely burned through. It not only saves coal, but also boils faster, shortening the time for cooking by one-third compared to the past. "Water Boiler Steaming Mantou" is to leave a small hole at the upper end of the hot water boiler, connect a pipe to the hole, build a platform next to the water boiler, and make the middle of the platform slightly concave to fit the steamer, then extend the pipe into the concave part of the platform and use steam to steam the mantou. A water boiler and steamer can hold three or four layers of steamers each time, and the steamed mantou is enough for more than 200 people to eat. The boiling water in the boiler is still supplied for drinking as usual.

　　The main method used by a certain unit of the Wuhan Garrison to save coal is "mixing soil into the coal." According to experiments, mixing 30 to 40 jin of yellow soil into every 100 jin of coal not only saves a lot of coal, but also does not affect the firepower. Li Mingguang, a soldier of the reconnaissance company of a certain unit of the Beijing Garrison, also saved half of the coal used for heating by mixing coal dust with soil.

　　In addition, the public security soldiers stationed at the Eighth Bridge of the Fengsha Line could not bear to see the loss of national property, and automatically swept up two tons of coal from the ice under the bridge in half a month.

### 解放军许多部队　采用各种办法大力节约用煤

　　采用各种办法大力节约用煤
    据新华社25日讯　中国人民解放军许多部队采用各种办法大力节约用煤。
    沈阳驻军某部采用适当合理合并办公室和宿舍的办法，减少了十九个大火炉，为国家节约煤炭五万三千九百多斤。这个部队还修改了四十个左右炉灶，缩小了炉灶的深度和口径，也节省了大量的烧煤。济南驻军某部，推广了炊事员龙绍成创造的“马蹄回龙灶”和炊事班长赵其光创造的“水炉蒸馒头”的方法，半年来，节约了五十九万多斤煤炭。“马蹄回龙灶”的主要特点是炉底小、矮，火苗集中，煤能完全烧透。它不仅省煤，而且开锅快，做一次饭的时间比过去要缩短三分之一。“水炉蒸馒头”是把开水锅炉上端留出个小孔，在孔上接一根管子，在水炉旁边修一个平台，台子当中稍凹，使其适合于安放蒸笼，然后将管子伸入平台上的凹部，利用蒸气来蒸熟馒头。一个水炉蒸灶，每次可放三、四层蒸笼，蒸出的馒头可够二百多人吃。锅炉里的开水，仍然和往常一样供人饮用。
    武汉驻军某部节约烧煤的主要办法是“煤中掺土”。据试验证明，每百斤煤掺三十到四十斤黄土，不仅能节省大量的煤，而且还不影响火力。北京驻军某部侦察连战士李明光等用煤末掺土烧，也节约了一半的烤火煤。
    此外，驻守在丰沙线八号桥头的公安战士们，不忍看到国家资财受到损失，在半个月内自动在桥下冰面上扫起了两吨煤。
