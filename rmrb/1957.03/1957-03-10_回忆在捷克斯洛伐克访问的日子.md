Recalling the Days of Visiting Czechoslovakia
Wu Kejian, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress

The delegation of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China paid a friendly visit to Czechoslovakia from December 2nd to 20th last year. I was honored to be a member of this delegation. In the short eighteen days of the visit, I was left with deep and unforgettable impressions. When we arrived at Prague Airport from Moscow by plane, young children presented us with clusters of fresh flowers cultivated in greenhouses, blossoming like spring, which made us feel the warmth of Prague. Warm applause erupted from the welcoming crowd at the airport, cheering "Long Live the People's China!" This was a sincere love for the victorious Chinese people. We also shouted "Long Live the People's Czechoslovakia!" Everyone was moved by the deep friendship between the Chinese and Czech people! It happened that on this day, the jet airliner officially opened the Prague-Moscow-Beijing route. Although Beijing and Prague are tens of thousands of miles apart, it only takes a dozen hours to reach. The people of China and Czechoslovakia are getting closer and closer, and no force in the world can prevent the development and consolidation of the friendship between the two peoples.

	Beautiful Prague

Prague is very beautiful, and also very fortunate. It did not suffer serious damage in the two World Wars, allowing the city to preserve magnificent and ancient buildings from various historical periods, from Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque to modern buildings. In Prague, we visited the ancient Charles Castle overlooking the city, the towering spires of St. Vitus Cathedral, and the famous Charles Bridge composed of stone statues. We also went to the magnificent "Czech Renaissance" style National Theatre to watch the opera "The Bartered Bride," which has been performed more than two thousand times and is famous in the world of art. All these quaint, uniquely flavored buildings and modern high-rise buildings of art make Prague one of the most beautiful cities in Europe. Here, the rich wisdom and great creativity of the Czechoslovak working people are fully displayed.

	Developed Industry

Czechoslovakia is an industrially developed country. Although I knew something about it in the past, it was only some impressions. After this visit, I gained some perceptual knowledge and learned a lot. After liberation, due to the implementation of the policy of socialist industrialization, in 1955, agriculture accounted for 30% of the national economy, while industry accounted for 70%. In the total industrial output value, consumer goods accounted for 37.8%, while means of production accounted for 62.2%. In developing industry, Czechoslovakia gave priority to the development of heavy industry. The machinery manufacturing industry developed rapidly. During the first five-year plan (1949-1953), the production volume of machinery manufacturing increased more than three times, and machinery exports accounted for about 50% of the total export trade in 1955, indicating that Czechoslovakia is an important machinery manufacturing country. The light industry in Czechoslovakia is also developed. The Svet ("Light") Shoe Factory in Gottwaldov, formerly the Bata Shoe Factory, which we visited, can produce more than 30 million pairs of shoes every year. Pilsen beer, various glass products from the Karlovy Vary Moser factory, and gloves from the Usta nylon factory in Jáchymov near the West German border are all of excellent quality and have always been sold well in many countries around the world.

The achievements of Czechoslovakia's industrialization are inseparable from the economic cooperation and assistance of socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia exports its own commodities to fraternal countries, and obtains the raw materials it needs from there. This characteristic can be seen from Czechoslovakia's foreign trade volume. For example, in 1948, Czechoslovakia's trade volume with the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries accounted for 32% of Czechoslovakia's total foreign trade, while that with capitalist countries accounted for 68%. By 1956, the trade volume with the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries had risen to 64.3%, which is a favorable change. Czechoslovakia also manufactures industrial equipment for fraternal countries, including our country, demonstrating the importance of economic cooperation between fraternal countries.

Frugality in national construction is one of the reasons for the achievements of Czechoslovakia's industrialization. During our visit, we realized that they made full use of the original industrial equipment and handicrafts. Many factories in Czechoslovakia have been around for decades or nearly a hundred years. Although most of the equipment in these factories has been modernized, the old factory buildings and old equipment are still being used. For example, the workshops of the Stalin Factory in Prague still retain the earliest architectural appearance, and the factory buildings of the Moser glass factory, whose products are world-famous, are all old, but this has not hindered the rapid increase in labor productivity. When we arrived at these factories, the staff welcomed us at the factory gate or in the workshop. There were no large auditoriums, no green parks, no ostentatious equipment; what was there was modern machinery and equipment, a long and solid technical foundation, a large number of skilled workers and engineering technicians, and products that meet modern international standards. They concentrated socialist accumulation, apart from gradually improving the material and cultural life of the workers, on production. Non-productive spending seems to be less. This spirit of building the country with diligence and thrift is worth learning from us.

The population of industrial cities in Czechoslovakia is not very concentrated. Prague, as the capital, is the center of electrical machinery and mechanical industry, with a population of only 940,000. Ostrava, the steel capital which is a heavy industrial center, has only 350,000 people. Gottwaldov, the world-famous center of shoemaking and rubber industry, has only 610,000 people. Bratislava, the capital of the Slovak region, has only more than 200,000 people. After liberation, many factories were moved from the Czech region, which greatly promoted the industrialization of the Slovak region. Judging from the fact that the population of industrial cities is not too concentrated and that the industrial development of minority areas is being helped, it reflects that the distribution of industrial areas in Czechoslovakia is relatively balanced. At the same time, this policy of caring for and helping minority nationalities has also promoted the brotherly unity between Czechs and Slovaks.

	High Standard of Living

During our visit, we saw that the standard of living of the Czechoslovak people is relatively high. The standard of living of any country must first be compared with the past. For example, before liberation, unemployment was also a terrible whip for the Czechoslovak working people. Before the Munich Agreement, the number of unemployed people almost never fell below 400,000, and in 1930 the number of unemployed people was nearly one million. Now, unemployment is just a terrible nightmare for the older generation of workers to recall. Today, every worker in Czechoslovakia, whether male or female, has a job. According to Comrade President Zápotocký, Czechoslovakia lacks a lot of labor force nationwide. After ten years of socialist construction in Czechoslovakia, industrial output in 1955 increased more than two times compared with 1937, and agriculture has also developed to a certain extent, which provides a huge material foundation. For example, in Czechoslovakia, there are an average of 3.3 pairs of shoes per person per year, which is equal to the American average. During the implementation of the first five-year plan, general wages increased by 35%, wages in industry and mining increased by 47%, and national income increased by nearly 59%. In 1955, the average wage in the industrial sector was 1,300 crowns. In addition, the welfare benefits given to employees by each enterprise, the continuous reduction of retail prices, the increase in education and health care expenses paid by the state for the people, and the low rent, etc., have greatly increased the actual wages of employees and greatly increased the purchasing power of the people. The Czechoslovak people obviously eat better, dress better, live better, and lead a rich and colorful cultural life than before liberation.

Brave Border Guards of the Peace Camp

Czechoslovakia is located in the center of Europe, at the crossroads of the European continent. From the geographical location of Czechoslovakia, today's Czechoslovakia is a brave border guard of the peace camp, and it has important stakes in European collective security. The Czechoslovak people will never forget that the first shot of the Hitler invaders was fired at Czechoslovakia. The German fascist occupation caused it to lose 30% of its territory and 33% of its population. Due to the betrayal of the imperialists and the surrender of the domestic big bourgeoisie, the shameful Munich Agreement brought deep disasters to the Czechoslovak people. Many people we met during our visit gnashed their teeth and remembered these past events vividly. Therefore, the Czechoslovak people's love for peace and freedom and their love for their motherland are stronger than at any time in history. During our visit to Czechoslovakia, it was precisely when the subversive activities of the imperialist aggressive forces in Hungary and the armed aggression against Egypt were severely defeated. The imperialists, like in the past, used every opportunity to provoke slander against socialist countries. According to Czechoslovak leaders, after the Hungarian incident, more than 60 West German radio stations broadcast deceptive and inflammatory propaganda to the Czechoslovak people every day, attempting to alienate the unity between socialist countries and undermine the unity of the Czechoslovak people. But what was the result? The imperialists fell through again! We are pleased to see that the Czechoslovak people expressed infinite indignation at the British, French, and Israeli aggression against Egypt and the counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary, and took a firm stand. The Czech government donated 90 million crowns worth of materials to Hungary, and the unity fund donated by the people themselves had reached 30 million crowns at that time. When Comrade Premier Široký talked about the events in Egypt and Hungary in his report to the Czechoslovak National Assembly, he said: "The Leninist road of building socialism that we are now taking is correct, and we should definitely and unwaveringly move forward along this road. The unchangeable cornerstone of our foreign policy is now, and will always be, the firm friendship and alliance between our country and the Soviet Union." This is a powerful rebuff by the Czechoslovak people and government to the imperialists' attempts to sow discord! The times have changed. The Czechoslovak people clearly understand that the Communists are their reliable servants and loyal sons, and the People's Democratic Government is the master of their own affairs. The fate of the Czechoslovak people is already in their own hands, and it is no longer possible for Washington, London, and Paris to manipulate it. Today's Czechoslovakia is already a free, independent, and proud country, and is already a strong fortress of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and a brave border guard on the western front.

    回忆在捷克斯洛伐克访问的日子
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副秘书长　吴克坚
    中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会代表团，从去年12月2日到20日，在捷克斯洛伐克进行了友好访问。我荣幸地是这个代表团的成员。在短短的十八天的访问中，留下了深刻而难忘的印象。当我们从莫斯科乘飞机到达布拉格机场的时候，少年儿童把在暖室里培养出来的、像春天盛开的一簇簇的鲜花送到我们手里，使我们感到布拉格的温暖。机场上欢迎的人群中爆发出一阵阵热烈的掌声，欢呼“人民中国万岁！”这是对胜利的中国人民一种真诚的热爱。我们也高呼着“人民的捷克斯洛伐克万岁！”大家为中捷两国人民的深厚友谊所激动！恰巧在这一天，喷气式客机已在布拉格—莫斯科—北京线上正式开航，从北京到布拉格相距万里，只需要十几个小时就可到达。中捷两国人民越来越接近了，世界上任何力量都不能够阻止中捷两国人民友谊的发展和巩固。
        美丽的布拉格
    布拉格是很美丽的，同时也是很幸运的。在两次世界大战中，都没有遭受到严重的破坏，使这个城市保存着历史发展各个时期的宏伟而古老的建筑物，从罗马式、哥德式、文艺复兴式、巴洛克式一直到现代化的建筑物。在布拉格，我们参观了俯瞰全市的古老的查理士城堡，参观了维特教堂高耸入云的尖塔，参观了由石刻人像所组成的著名的查理士大桥。我们还到过雄伟的“捷克文艺复兴”式的民族剧院，观看已经上演两千多次、驰名世界艺坛的歌剧“被出卖的新嫁娘”。所有这些古色古香、别饶风味的建筑物和现代化艺术的高楼大厦，使布拉格被认为是欧洲大陆上最美丽城市之一。这里充分显示出捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民的丰富智慧和伟大的创造力。
          发达的工业
    捷克斯洛伐克是一个工业发达的国家，过去虽然知道一些，但只是一些印象，经过这次访问，增加了一些感性认识，并学到了许多知识。解放后的捷克斯洛伐克，由于实行了社会主义工业化的政策，1955年国民经济的比重中，农业占30％，而工业却占70％。在工业总产值中消费资料占37.8％，而生产资料占了62.2％。在发展工业中，捷克斯洛伐克优先发展了重工业。机器制造业发展很快，在第一个五年计划期间（1949—1953年）机器制造的生产量提高了三倍多，机器出口占1955年出口贸易总额的50％左右，可见捷克斯洛伐克是一个重要的机器制造的国家。捷克斯洛伐克的轻工业也是发达的。我们在哥德尔多夫参观的光明皮鞋厂即前拔佳皮鞋厂，每年就可生产三千多万双鞋子。比尔森的啤酒、卡罗维发利莫吉尔工厂的各种玻璃产品、靠近西德边境亚斯市优司达尼龙工厂的手套，品质都很优良，一向畅销世界许多国家。
    捷克斯洛伐克工业化的成就，是同社会主义国家，特别是苏联在经济上的合作和帮助分不开的。捷克斯洛伐克把自己的商品输往兄弟国家，而从那里取得自己必需的原料，这从捷克斯洛伐克对外贸易额可以看出这一特点。例如，1948年捷克斯洛伐克同苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易额占捷克斯洛伐克对外贸易总额的32％，同资本主义国家的占68％。到1956年同苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易额就上升到64.3％，这是一个有利的变化。捷克斯洛伐克也为兄弟国家，其中包括为我国制造工业装备，显示出兄弟国家经济合作的重要性。
    勤俭建国是捷克斯洛伐克工业化取得成就的原因之一。我们在参观中体会到，他们充分利用了原有的工业设备，利用了手工艺技术。捷克斯洛伐克有许多工厂都已有几十年到近百年的历史，这些厂的设备虽大部分已现代化了，但旧厂房和旧设备仍在被利用着。例如布拉格的斯大林工厂的车间，还保存了最早的建筑模样，出品驰名世界的莫吉尔玻璃工厂的厂房都是老的，可是这并没有妨碍劳动生产率的迅速提高。当我们到达这些工厂的时候，职工就在厂门口或是在车间欢迎我们，那里没有大礼堂，没有绿化的公园，没有讲排场的设备；那里有的是现代的机器设备，有的是悠久雄厚的技术基础，有的是大量的技术工人和工程技术人员，有的是够得上现代国际水平的产品。他们把社会主义的积累，除了逐步改善职工的物质文化生活以外，集中用在生产方面。非生产性的花费看来是少的。这种勤俭建国的精神是值得我们学习的。
    捷克斯洛伐克工业城市的人口是不太集中的。作为首都的布拉格，是电机和机械工业的中心，人口不过九十四万。重工业中心的钢都——俄斯特拉发，不过三十五万人。闻名世界的制鞋和橡胶业中心哥特瓦尔多夫城，不过六十一万多人。斯洛伐克地区的首府布拉迪斯拉发也不过二十多万人。解放以后，从捷克地区迁去了很多工厂，大大地促进了斯洛伐克区工业化的发展。从工业城市人口不太集中和帮助少数民族地区工业发展来看，就反映出捷克斯洛伐克工业地区的分布是比较平衡的，同时，这种关怀和帮助少数民族的政策，也促使捷克人和斯洛伐克人兄弟般的团结更加巩固了。
      高度的生活水平
    我们在访问中，看到捷克斯洛伐克人民生活水平是比较高的。任何一个国家生活水平的高低，首先要同过去比较。例如解放以前，对捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民来讲，失业也是一根可怕的鞭子。在慕尼黑协定以前，失业人数几乎从来没有降到四十万人以下，1930年失业人数差不多有一百万人。现在，失业不过是老一代的劳动者作为回忆过去一场可怕的恶梦罢了。今天，捷克斯洛伐克每一个劳动者，无论男女，都有工作。据捷总统萨波托斯基同志告诉我们，捷克斯洛伐克全国还缺少很多的劳动力。捷克斯洛伐克经过了十年社会主义的建设，1955年工业产量比1937年增加了两倍多，农业也有一定的发展，这就提供了巨大的物质基础。例如在捷克斯洛伐克平均每人每年有三点三双鞋子，这就等于美国的平均数了。在执行第一个五年计划期间内，一般工资增加了35％，工矿业的工资增加了47％，全国国民收入差不多增加了59％。1955年工业部门的平均工资为一千三百克郎。此外，每个企业给予职工的福利，零售物价不断的减低，国家为人民付出的教育费、保健费的增加，房租的低廉等等，都使职工的实际工资大大增加，使人民的购买力大为提高，捷克斯洛伐克人民比解放以前显然是要吃得好、穿得好和住得好，并且过着丰富多采的文化生活。
  和平阵营勇敢的边防战士
    捷克斯洛伐克位于欧洲中部，当欧洲大陆的要冲，从捷克斯洛伐克的地理位置来说，今天的捷克斯洛伐克是和平阵营的勇敢的边防战士，它对欧洲集体安全有着重要的利害关系。捷克斯洛伐克人民永远不会忘记希特勒侵略军的第一枪是向着捷克斯洛伐克开的。德国法西斯的占领，使它丧失了30％的领土和33％的人口。由于帝国主义者的出卖和国内大资产阶级的投降，可耻的慕尼黑协定带给捷克斯洛伐克人民以深重的灾难。我们访问期间所碰到的许多人，在回忆起这些往事的时候，无不咬牙切齿，记忆犹新。因此，捷克斯洛伐克人民热爱和平自由、热爱自己祖国，是比历史上任何时期来得强烈。我们在捷克斯洛伐克访问期间，正是帝国主义侵略势力在匈牙利的颠覆活动和对埃及的武装进攻都遭到了严重失败的时候。帝国主义者也像他们过去一样，利用每一个机会向社会主义各国进行挑拨诽谤。据捷克斯洛伐克领导同志告诉我们，当匈牙利事件发生后，有六十多个西德的广播电台，每天向着捷克斯洛伐克人民进行欺骗和煽动的宣传，企图离间社会主义各国间的团结，破坏捷克斯洛伐克人民内部的团结，可是结果怎么样呢？帝国主义又落了一场空！我们高兴地看到捷克斯洛伐克人民对英、法、以侵略埃及和匈牙利的反革命暴动表示了无限的愤慨，采取了坚定的立场。捷政府对匈牙利赠送了九千万克郎的物资，人民自己捐献的团结基金当时已达三千万克郎。捷总理西罗基同志在向捷国民议会的报告中谈到埃及和匈牙利事件时说：“我们现在走的建设社会主义的列宁主义的道路是正确的，应当肯定地不动摇地沿着这条道路前进。我们的外交政策的不可改变的基石，现在是，将来还是我国和苏联的巩固的友谊和同盟。”这是捷克斯洛伐克人民和政府对帝国主义者的挑拨离间的一个有力回击！时代已经变了，捷克斯洛伐克人民清楚地了解到共产党人是自己可靠的勤务员和忠实的儿子，人民民主政府是由自己当家作主的。捷克斯洛伐克人民的命运已经掌握在他们自己手里，再也不可能由华盛顿、伦敦、巴黎来摆布了。今天的捷克斯洛伐克已经是一个自由独立和值得骄傲的国家，已经是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的一个坚强的堡垒和西方前线的勇敢的边防战士。（附图片）
