Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 6th: The "Washington Post and Times Herald" published an editorial on the 5th, criticizing the United States' attitude towards the People's Republic of China. The title of the editorial was "Our Ostrich-like Policy Towards China."

The editorial stated that the episode of prohibiting American journalists from visiting China requires a "re-examination" of America's attitude towards China, because this attitude "is not based on reality."

The newspaper criticized Dulles's statement that considering recognition of the People's Republic of China was "premature." It said, "It is worth considering what the United States has done to seek a peaceful resolution of relations with China. We oppose sending journalists to China. We have used all our power to prevent China from entering the United Nations, disregarding the advice and persuasion of our friends. We have tried to persuade our allies not to trade with China. We stubbornly pursue a policy of supporting the Formosa government (Taiwan's Chiang Kai-shek group), which is largely based on myth."

The editorial pointed out that the Chiang Kai-shek planes harassing the mainland of China "are provided by the United States, and the pilots are also trained by American officers. It is inconceivable that their flights would be carried out without the consent of American officials." The newspaper said that therefore, "the provocation undoubtedly comes from the American side. The path followed by American policy is very similar to the policy towards Russia after the First World War... A large proportion of people believe that, regrettably, the United States seems determined to make its attitude appear very unrealistic, because it stubbornly and blindly opposes the changes that have already occurred. This policy has not been successful, as we have already learned in dealing with Russia. Whether we like it or not, we have to live on the same planet with China."

The editorial continued, pointing out that prohibiting journalists from visiting the People's Republic of China is, in the final analysis, to prevent the American people from knowing the situation on the vast mainland of China. It said, "This policy of burying one's head in the sand is bound to fail. The longer we insist on this policy, the greater the danger to our prestige and our interests in the Far East." The editorial said: "Establishing friendly relations with Communist China and achieving a comprehensive settlement with it may be impossible at the present stage. But it is entirely possible to begin restoring American policy to reality." The editorial believes that the first step is to "no longer artificially restrict American journalists from interviewing news, so that we and the free world can know more about the actual situation in China," and the second step is to "end the crusade to exclude Communist China from the United Nations." At the same time, the editorial also advocated "obtaining a separate seat for Taiwan in the (United Nations) General Assembly."

### 美国“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”  不满美国驼鸟式的对华政策

    美国“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”
    不满美国驼鸟式的对华政策
    新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”5日发表社论，抨击美国对中华人民共和国的态度。这篇社论的题目是“我们的驼鸟式的对华政策”。
    社论写道，禁止美国记者访问中国的插曲要求“重新研究”美国对中国的态度，因为这种态度“不是从实际出发的”。
    报纸抨击杜勒斯这样的说法：考虑承认中华人民共和国，“为时尚早”。它说，“美国在争取和平解决同中国的关系方面做了些什么，这是值得考虑的。我们反对派遣新闻记者到中国去。我们不顾朋友们的忠告和劝说，用尽一切力量来阻止中国进入联合国。我们企图劝我们的盟国不要同中国贸易。我们固执地执行支持在很大程度上以神话为基础的福摩萨政府（台湾蒋介石集团）的政策。”
    社论指出，在中国大陆上空进行骚扰的蒋介石飞机“是美国提供的，飞行员也是美国军官训练出来的。不可想像，他们的飞行会不经美国官员的同意”。报纸说，因此，“挑衅无疑出于美国方面。美国政策所遵循的路线十分相似第一次世界大战后对俄政策的路线……很大一部分人都认为，令人遗憾的是，美国似乎硬是要使它的态度表现得十分不现实，因为它固执地、盲目地反对已经发生的变化。这种政策一直没有成功，在对付俄国的时候我们就已经了解到这一点了。我们喜欢也好，不喜欢也好，我们总得同中国一起生活在一个星球上。”
    社论接着指出，禁止记者访问中华人民共和国，归根到底是为了不让美国人民知道辽阔的中国大陆上的情况，它说，“这种把头藏在沙中的政策肯定是会失败的。我们坚持这个政策越久，我们的威信和我们在远东的利益受到的危险也越大”。社论说：“要同共产党中国建立友好关系和同它取得全面解决在目前阶段也许是不可能的。但是开始把美国政策恢复到现实的地步是完全可能的。”社论认为，第一个步骤是“不再人为地限制美国记者采访新闻，这样我们和自由世界就能够更多地知道中国的实际情况”，第二个步骤是“结束要把共产党中国排除在联合国外的十字军运动”。同时，社论又主张要“为台湾在（联合国）大会中取得一个单独的席位”。
