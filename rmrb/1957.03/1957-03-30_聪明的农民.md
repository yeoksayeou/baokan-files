　　The Clever Farmer
　　Once upon a time, there was a tyrant who forbade anyone from entering his territory. His guards would ask everyone who wanted to pass through the territory:
　　"What are you here for?"
　　If the passerby's answer was not the truth, the guards would, according to the tyrant's order, seize him and hang him on the spot. If the passerby's answer was the truth, the guards would, according to the tyrant's order, immediately push him into the river and drown him.
　　Thus, no one dared to approach the tyrant's territory.
　　But there was such a farmer who calmly walked towards this forbidden area.
　　"What are you here for?" The guard sternly ordered him to stop, ready to execute this bold and fearless man.
　　But the farmer rendered the guard helpless.
　　The farmer replied:
　　"I came here to be hanged."
　　This answer left the guard at a loss. How should he deal with this farmer? To hang him would mean that the farmer was telling the truth. But the order stipulated that those who tell the truth should not be hanged, but drowned. However, if he were to drown him, it would also not comply with the tyrant's order. Because that would mean he was not telling the truth. And for those who do not tell the truth, the order stipulates that they should be hanged.
　　In this way, the clever farmer righteously passed through the territory.

　　聪明的农民
    从前有一个暴君，他不准任何人进入他的领地。他的卫兵对每个想通过领地的人都要问一句：
      “你干什么来的？”
    如果过路人的回答不是实话，卫兵就按照暴君的命令把他抓起来就地吊死。如果过路人的回答是实话，卫兵就按照暴君的命令立刻把他推到河中淹死。
    这样，任何人也不敢接近暴君的领地。
    但是有这样一个农民，他很镇静地向这块禁地走来。
    “你干什么来的？”卫兵很严厉地命令他止步，接着就要处死这个胆大无畏的人。
    可是这个农民却使卫兵无所适从了。
    农民回答说：
    “我来的目的是为了吊死的。”
    他这个回答使卫兵束手无策了。他究竟应当怎样处置这个农民呢？把他吊死嘛，这就等于农民说的是实话。而命令所规定的：对说实话的人应当不是吊死，而是把他淹死。但是，如果把他淹死，这也不符合暴君的命令。因为这样就等于他说的不是实话。而对于不说实话的人，命令规定要吊死的。
    这样，这位聪明的农民就理直气壮地通过了领地。
