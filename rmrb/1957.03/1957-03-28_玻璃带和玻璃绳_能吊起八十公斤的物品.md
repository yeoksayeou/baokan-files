　　Glass Tape and Glass Rope
　　Can Lift 80 Kilograms of Items
    According to a report in the Shanghai Labor Daily: Not long ago, engineer Cheng Weimin and his wife, along with an assistant, used a machine they made themselves to turn pieces of broken glass into snow-white, high-grade glass fiber yarn. Now, this young engineer has spun this yarn into thread and woven it into glass tape and glass rope.
    The glass tape, as thin and wide as a ribbon in a girl's braid, and the glass rope, as thick as a coarse woolen thread, can withstand a pulling force of 20 kilograms and lift a bicycle weighing 80 kilograms. These tapes and ropes are also resistant to strong currents, fire, oil immersion, and acid corrosion. They can be used as insulation materials for various generators, motors, and telecommunications electrical equipment, as well as thermal insulation materials for trains, ships, and airplanes. When combined with plastic, they can be pressed into various machine parts that are both heat-resistant and resistant to strong pressure.
    In order to successfully produce glass tape and glass rope, Engineer Cheng began new trial production work after successfully producing high-grade glass fiber yarn in September of last year. In more than five months, he scoured more than 200 old iron shops and hardware stalls, collecting various waste parts to assemble three machines for parallel winding, gluing, and tape weaving. Now, Engineer Cheng is also preparing to weave high-grade glass fiber yarn into glass cloth as smooth and white as cicada wings.

### 玻璃带和玻璃绳　能吊起八十公斤的物品

　　玻璃带和玻璃绳
　　能吊起八十公斤的物品
    据上海劳动报消息：不久前，工程师程伟民和他的爱人、一个助手，利用一部自己制造的机器，把一块块碎玻璃制成一根根雪白的高级玻璃纤维纱。现在，这位年青的工程师又把这种纱纺成线，织成了玻璃带和玻璃绳。
    像姑娘发辫上的绸带一样又薄又阔的玻璃带和像一根粗绒线一样粗的玻璃绳，能经得住二十公斤大的拉力，吊得起一部八十公斤重的机器脚踏车。这些带和绳，还不怕强电流、火烧和油浸、酸烂，可做各种各样发电机、马达和电讯电器设备的绝缘器材，也可做火车、轮船、飞机的保暖隔热器材；如果和塑胶合在一起还能压成各种既能耐热又抵抗强压力的各种机器零件。
    程工程师为了试制成玻璃带和玻璃绳，从去年9月份试制成高级玻璃纤维纱后，就开始了新的试制工作。他在五个多月内，跑遍了两百多个旧铁店和五金摊，收集各种废旧零件，装置成了并线、上胶和织带等三部机器。现在，程工程师还准备把高级玻璃纤维纱织成像蝉翼一样光洁、皓白的玻璃布。
