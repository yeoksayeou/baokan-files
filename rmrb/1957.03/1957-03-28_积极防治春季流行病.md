　　Actively Prevent and Control Spring Epidemics
　　Wei Sheng
    Since the beginning of spring, many regions have experienced outbreaks of respiratory infectious diseases such as epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis and influenza, with serious incidence and widespread transmission. Especially in collective units such as schools, government offices, and factories, due to the failure to implement timely isolation measures, it is common for one person to become ill and then infect dozens or even hundreds of people within a day or two, which has a significant impact on learning, work, and production. According to incomplete statistics, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis has been discovered in more than one hundred cities and counties in more than ten provinces, including Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Henan, and is spreading in some areas. Influenza has affected an even wider area. Therefore, taking active and effective measures to prevent the onset and control the continued spread of these diseases is an extremely important task for health departments in various regions at present.

    From the current situation, many provinces and cities have already taken or are taking some effective measures to prevent the development of the disease, and have achieved some results. However, some regions and units lack awareness of the epidemic and have relaxed their prevention and control efforts. In order to quickly control the continued spread of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis and influenza, areas where the above-mentioned diseases have been discovered and areas adjacent to the affected areas should actively organize and mobilize public and private medical resources, organize mobile medical teams, and go deep into factories, schools, government offices, and places with relatively concentrated populations and poor living environments to carry out prevention and control work, striving to ensure that every seriously ill patient receives appropriate treatment and care. Furthermore, it is important to guide all collective units to do everything possible to achieve immediate isolation of patients upon discovery, to prevent the increase of new cases. In addition, it is even more important to strengthen prevention work in unaffected areas and collective units, actively carry out the spring patriotic health campaign, and combine it with the prevention and control of spring-related diseases. Through these activities, conduct a general health education for the masses, making them aware of the harm of seasonal diseases and their causes, understand and master the specific methods for preventing and controlling these diseases, proactively improve environmental hygiene and pay attention to personal hygiene, and strive to control the spread of these diseases in a short period of time.

    Health departments in various regions should conscientiously implement the principle of "prevention first," and while actively carrying out prevention and control work, also strengthen the research on various seasonal diseases, master the patterns of occurrence and development of these diseases, so as to achieve early detection and timely prevention and treatment.

　　积极防治春季流行病
　　韦生
    入春以来，不少地区发生流行性脑脊髓膜炎、流行性感冒等呼吸道传染病，发病情况严重，传染面很广。特别是学校、机关、工厂等集体单位，由于没有及时做好隔离工作，常常是一个人发病，一两天内便传染十几人乃至上百人，对学习、工作、生产影响很大。据不完全统计，湖北、湖南、江西、河南等十多个省的一百多个市县，都发现流行性脑脊髓膜炎，部分地区正在蔓延；流行性感冒波及的面更广。因此，积极采取有效措施，防止发病和控制疾病的继续蔓延流行，是当前各地卫生部门的一件极为重要的工作。
    从目前的情况来看，不少省市已经或正在采取一些有效措施防止病情的发展，并且收到了一些效果。但也有一些地区和单位缺乏疫情观念，放松了这方面的防治工作。为了迅速控制流行性脑脊髓膜炎、流行性感冒的继续蔓延，发现上述疾病的地区和病区的邻近地区，应当积极组织和动员公私医疗力量，组织巡回医疗小组，深入到工厂、学校、机关和人口比较集中、居住环境比较差的地方，进行防治工作，争取使每一个重病人都能得到适当的治疗和护理，并且指导各集体单位尽一切可能争取做到发现病人即行隔离，防止新病人的增加。此外，更重要的是加强对未发病地区和集体单位的预防工作，积极开展春季爱国卫生运动，并同预防春季多发病的防治工作结合起来。通过这些活动，向群众普遍地进行一次卫生教育，使群众认识到季节性多发病的危害和它的成因，了解和掌握防治这些疾病的具体方法，主动地去改善环境卫生和注重个人卫生，争取在短期内控制这些疾病的蔓延。
    各地卫生部门应当认真贯彻预防为主的方针，在积极进行防治的同时，也要加强对各个季节性多发病的研究工作，掌握这些疾病的发生、发展的规律，以便做到早期发现，即时防治。
