Xinhua News Agency, London, March 30th - The Marquis of Salisbury, Leader of the House of Lords and Lord President of the Council, resigned on March 29th because he opposed the release of Archbishop Makarios.

Salisbury had been the Leader of the House of Lords since 1951. He is a member of the Cecil family, which has played an important role in British decision-making for more than 350 years, and was one of the ministers who demanded that the war of aggression against Egypt should not cease until Egypt was occupied and Nasser's government was overthrown. After Eden's resignation, his opinion played a decisive role in the selection of Macmillan as Prime Minister. It is believed here that his resignation will cause a crisis within the Conservative Party.

    反对释放马卡里奥斯
    英国枢密院长辞职
    据新华社伦敦30日电　英国上院领袖、枢密院长索耳兹伯里侯爵3月29日辞职，因为他反对释放马卡里奥斯大主教。
    索耳兹伯里自从1951年以来一直是上院的领袖。他是三百五十多年来在英国决策方面起着重要作用的塞西尔大家族的成员，并且是要求把侵略埃及的战争进行到不占领埃及和不推翻纳赛尔政府决不罢休的一批大臣之一。艾登辞职后，他的意见对于遴选麦克米伦担任首相曾经起过决定性的作用。这里认为，他的辞职将在保守党内部引起危机。
