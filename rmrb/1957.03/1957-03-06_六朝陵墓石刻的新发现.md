The stone carvings of the Six Dynasties tombs in Jiangsu Province are a precious legacy of our national cultural relics and occupy an important position in the entire history of Chinese sculpture. Previously discovered Six Dynasties tomb stone carvings include eighteen sites in Nanjing, such as the Chuning Mausoleum of Emperor Wu of the Song Dynasty, Liu Yu, and ten sites in Danyang, such as the Taian Mausoleum of Emperor Gao of the Qi Dynasty, Xiao Daocheng. Due to years of disrepair, some of these valuable historical relics have been eroded by wind and rain for a long time, making the inscriptions difficult to distinguish; others have been buried underground for many years, and no one has paid attention to them. Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Bureau of Culture has repaired the stone carvings of the Six Dynasties tombs, focusing on excavating and renovating more than ten sites in Nanjing and Danyang. During the restoration project, the Yongning Mausoleum of Emperor Wen of the Chen Dynasty, Chen Qian, was discovered, the stone qilin of the Chuning Mausoleum of Emperor Wu of the Song Dynasty, Liu Yu, was repaired, and the stone tianlu of the mausoleum of Emperor Wu of the Song Dynasty, Liu Yu, and the stone bixie of the tomb of Xiao Hong of the Liang Dynasty were unearthed. This series of important discoveries has made a significant contribution to the study of the history and art of the Six Dynasties.

Chen Qian, Emperor Wen of the Chen Dynasty, was the second emperor of the Chen Dynasty (560-566) during the Southern and Northern Dynasties. After his death, he was buried in the Yongning Mausoleum, which, according to ancient books, was located on the southern side of Lingshan, forty miles northeast of Nanjing (Tang Xu Song's "Jiankang Shilu," "Yuanhe Junxian Zhi," Song Zhang Dunyi's "Classified Compilation of Six Dynasties Affairs"). In the past, due to inconsistent textual research on Lingshan, there was considerable controversy regarding the location of the Yongning Mausoleum of Emperor Wen of the Chen Dynasty. Recently, Comrade Jin Qi of the Nanjing Municipal Cultural Relics Preservation Committee discovered a stone bixie on top of a sacred path stone pillar at Shizichong on the southern side of Lingshan, northeast of Zijin Mountain, outside Qilinmen, Nanjing, fundamentally solving the location problem of the Yongning Mausoleum of Emperor Wen of the Chen Dynasty. This Lingshan is about forty miles away from Nanjing. The south side of the mountain has a place called "Shizichong" (Lion Gully); and the fields there are called "Shizi Tian" (Lion Field). The local people of Nanjing call the stone beasts of the Six Dynasties tombs "lions," and many places are named Shizichong, where there are stone beasts from the Six Dynasties tombs. Now that this place is called Shizichong, there should be stone beasts; moreover, there is still a small stone bixie, which was found inside the bamboo fence of a military unit's barracks. Two-thirds of the stone bixie is buried in the soil, with only its head and neck protruding from the soil. The bixie has its mouth open and its tongue extended, and it is carved very vividly. Judging from its style, it can be confirmed as an ornament on top of a sacred path stone pillar from the Six Dynasties. It can be seen that there was originally a Six Dynasties tomb here, and judging from its location, it is precisely the Yongning Mausoleum of Emperor Wen of the Chen Dynasty; however, “Lingshan” (灵山) is mistakenly written as “陵山” (Lingshan) on the map. Also, near the south side of Shizichong, there is a village called Donglin Village; near Qilinpu, Qilinmen, north of the mausoleum of Emperor Wu of the Song Dynasty, there is a village called Xilin Village. The two villages are no more than two li apart. These two villages, Donglin and Xilin, should be written as Dongling and Xiling. Dongling refers to being close to the Yongning Mausoleum of Chen Qian, Emperor Wen of the Chen Dynasty, and Xiling Village refers to being close to the Chuning Mausoleum of Liu Yu, Emperor Wu of the Song Dynasty. The meaning is very clear. Therefore, whether from the perspective of physical objects, ancient records, or existing place name comparisons, it is sufficient to prove that this is the Yongning Mausoleum of Emperor Wen of the Chen Dynasty. After the discovery of this mausoleum, the number of Six Dynasties tomb stone carvings discovered near Nanjing has increased from eighteen to nineteen, reaching a total of twenty-nine including the Six Dynasties tombs in Danyang.

In addition, during the restoration of the Six Dynasties tomb stone carvings, the stele pavilion of the tomb of Xiao Dan of the Liang Dynasty was also built, a stone qilin of the Chuning Mausoleum of Emperor Wu of the Song Dynasty, Liu Yu, was repaired, and a stone tianlu was unearthed (according to the system of the imperial mausoleums of the Six Dynasties, there must be a pair of stone beasts in front of the mausoleum, the one on the left with two horns on its head is generally called tianlu; the one on the right with a single horn on its head is commonly called qilin). This stone tianlu has been lying by the pond for hundreds of years, and most of it has been immersed in water, and no one has paid attention to it. Now it has been newly unearthed, and except for the lower part of the four legs, which is already incomplete, it is still relatively complete; especially the lines of the head are clear, the carving is extremely vivid, and the two horns on the head are also very obvious. In addition, a stone bixie from the tomb of Xiao Hong of the Liang Dynasty was unearthed. Because most of this stone bixie was buried in the soil, it is relatively well preserved. The stone bixie is very tall and takes a big step forward, and its posture is also very vivid; especially the tail is thick at the front and thin at the back, and the villi at the end of the tail are divided into several strands, curved inward, and brushed straight forward, making it particularly powerful. Only a sculptor with great courage can possess such a grand stroke. These stone carvings can all be called treasures of our national cultural relics.

In Danyang, the stone tianlu of the Xiuling Mausoleum of Emperor Wu of the Liang Dynasty, Xiao Yan, was repaired, the stone beast of the Jianling Mausoleum of Emperor Wen of the Liang Dynasty, Xiao Shunzhi, was straightened, and the stone beast of the Jing'an Mausoleum of Emperor Wu of the Qi Dynasty, Xiao Ze, was unearthed from the pond. Also, there is a pair of large stone beasts by the Yunhe River in Danyang Lingkou, which was mentioned in Lu You's "Diary of Entering Shu" in the Song Dynasty. They are the tallest, and for more than a thousand years, they have been lying on the river bank, and no one has paid attention to them. Now they are lifted out with a crane, and steel-concrete stone bases are made separately for repair. This pair of stone beasts, facing each other across the Xiaotang Port, are decorations at the entrance of the Danyang tomb area.

The stone carvings of the Six Dynasties tombs are divided into three types: stone pillars, stone beasts, and steles. The stone pillars are all round or slightly elliptical, and the pillars are carved with concave and sunken straight fluted patterns, commonly known as "Greek-style" stone pillars; above them are carved sacred path inscriptions, with the words "Sacred Path of So-and-so" written in large characters; above that is a round cover with lotus patterns, and on top of the cover stands a small bixie. This style is obviously influenced by the Ashoka stone pillars in ancient Indian Buddhist art. Stone beasts are divided into three types: stone bixie (hornless), stone qilin (unicorn), and stone tianlu (two horns). Generally, in front of the imperial tombs, there are tianlu on the left and qilin on the right, while in front of the tombs of princes and marquises, there are pairs of bixie. The stone beasts all have wings on their bodies and are decorated luxuriously. Some people believe that this is influenced by the winged beast sculptures of ancient "Assyria." Relatively few steles have been preserved, but even with the existing steles of the tombs of Xiao Dan and Xiao Hong, the scale is very grand. On the side of the stele of Xiao Hong's tomb, there are carvings in eight directions, on which are carved mythological figures and animals, with extremely vivid images. Their style is similar to the stone carvings of the Wu Liang stone chamber and the Yinan ancient tomb portrait stones of the Eastern Han Dynasty, and they are rare reliefs among the stone carvings of the Six Dynasties tombs. But unfortunately, the inscription itself, due to the long years and frequent wind and rain erosion, is mostly unclear. The stele of Xiao Dan's tomb is better preserved and was written by Bei Yiyuan of Wuxing. A modern epigrapher, Mo Youzhi, said that it "is equal in style and charm to the Northern Wei inscriptions, but slightly brighter, which is where the north and south are largely the same but slightly different." He also said that it "inherits from Zhong (You) and Wang (Xizhi) above, and opens up to Ou (Yangxun) and Xue (Ji) below" (all famous calligraphers), and his evaluation is extremely high. Such a curved stele of huge size, with texts as long as several thousand characters, are all written in regular script, and the strokes are bright and powerful, which shows the calligrapher's attainments.

The existing stone carvings of the Six Dynasties tombs are a treasure in the history of Chinese sculpture. Because these carvings are related to cultural exchanges between the East and the West, they have attracted the attention of international archaeologists. In the past, imperialist elements tried every means to steal them. From 1935 to 1936, the "International Exhibition of Chinese Art" was held in London, which included a stone qilin from a Six Dynasties tomb (picture number 2361), with its four legs and tail broken, leaving only its head and torso, which was sent by the United States to participate in the exhibition. Judging from its style, it is majestic and calm, obviously a work from the early Liu Song era of the Six Dynasties, which was stolen by American imperialists. These existing twenty-nine Six Dynasties tomb stone carvings are indeed a valuable legacy of our national cultural relics. When we discuss the sculpture of the Southern and Northern Dynasties of China, we mostly use Buddhist statue sculptures as the main material, while this large batch of stone carvings are a large number of works other than Buddhist art. With them, we can explore the stone carvings of the Han Dynasty above, and observe the various stone beasts of the Tang Dynasty tombs below, and their importance is self-evident. This restoration of the Six Dynasties tomb stone carvings in Jiangsu Province is one of the cultural relic works worth introducing. It is hoped that the cultural relic management agencies in the future will properly keep them. (Attached picture)

    六朝陵墓石刻的新发现
    朱契
    江苏省的六朝陵墓石刻，是祖国文物中宝贵遗产之一，在整个中国雕塑史上，占有重要的地位。过去已经发现的六朝陵墓石刻，在南京有宋武帝刘裕初宁陵等十八处，在丹阳有齐高帝萧道成泰安陵等十处。因为年久失修，这些宝贵的历史文物，有的久经风雨剥蚀，字画难辨；有的多年来埋在地下，无人过问。最近江苏省文化局修复六朝陵墓石刻，重点地发掘、修整了南京、丹阳两地十余处。在修复工程中，发现了陈文帝陈茜的永宁陵，修复了宋武帝刘裕初宁陵的石麒麟，掘出了宋武帝刘裕陵的石天禄和梁代萧宏墓的石辟邪。这一系列的重要发现，对于研究六朝历史和造型艺术，有很大的贡献。
    陈文帝陈茜，是南北朝时代陈朝的第二个皇帝（560—566），他死后葬于永宁陵，据古书记载，是在南京东北四十里陵山之阳（唐许嵩建康实录，元和郡县志，宋张敦颐六朝事迹编类）。过去因对于陵山考证不一致，所以对于陈文帝永宁陵的所在地问题，颇有争论。最近南京市文物保管委员会金琦同志，在南京麒麟门外紫金山东北灵山之阳狮子冲，发现了一个神道石柱顶上的石辟邪，根本解决了陈文帝永宁陵的地点问题。这座灵山离南京约有四十里。山的南面，有地名叫“狮子冲”；而那边的田，就叫做“狮子田”。南京当地人民，叫六朝陵墓石兽做狮子，有许多地名叫狮子冲，那里便有六朝陵墓石兽存在。现在这个地方既叫做狮子冲，应该就有石兽存在；而且现在该地还存有小石辟邪一只，是在某驻军部队营房竹篱内发现的。石辟邪三分之二埋在土中，仅头部和颈部伸出土外。辟邪张口伸舌，雕刻得非常生动；看它的风格，可以肯定为六朝神道石柱顶上的饰物。可见这里原来有一座六朝陵墓，考其地点，正是陈文帝的永宁陵；不过
  “陵山”在地图上误写作“灵山”罢了。又靠近狮子冲南面，有村叫做东林村；靠近麒麟门麒麟铺宋武帝陵北面，有村叫做西林村。二村相距不过二里。这东林、西林二村，应该写作东陵、西陵。东陵是指靠近陈文帝陈茜永宁陵，西陵村是指靠近宋武帝刘裕初宁陵，意思是十分明白的。所以无论从实物方面，古籍记载方面，以及现存地名对照方面，都足以证明这是陈文帝的永宁陵。这个陵发现以后，南京附近已发现的六朝陵墓石刻，已由十八处增加至十九处，连丹阳六朝陵墓在内，一共达到二十九处。
    此外，在修复六朝陵墓石刻中，又修建了梁代萧憺墓的碑亭，修复了宋武帝刘裕初宁陵石麒麟一只，掘出了石天禄一只（按照六朝帝王陵制度，陵前一定有一对石兽，左边的头上双角，一般叫做天禄；右边的头上独角，普通叫做麒麟）。这只石天禄数百年来，一直倒在池塘边上，而且大半浸在水中，无人过问。现在新经掘出，除四腿下部已经残缺外，尚比较完整；尤以头部线条清楚，雕刻极为生动，头上双角，也极为明显。另外又掘出梁代萧宏墓石辟邪一只，这个石辟邪因大部分埋在土中，所以保存得比较完整。石辟邪十分高大，作大踏步向前迈进的形状，姿态也非常生动；尤以尾部前粗后细，尾端茸毛分散为数股，向内弯曲，向前直刷，格外显得有力。雕刻家非有极大的魄力，不能具此大手笔。这几件石刻，都可称为我国文物中的瑰宝。
    在丹阳方面，修复了梁武帝萧衍修陵的石天禄，扶正了梁文帝萧顺之建陵的石兽，并从水塘中掘出了齐武帝萧赜景安陵的石兽。又丹阳陵口运河边上有大石兽一对，在宋代陆游的“入蜀记”中已经提到，最为高大，千余年来，一直倒在河边岸上，无人过问。现在用起重机把它们起出，并且另做钢筋混凝土石座，加以修整。这一对石兽，夹着萧塘港相望，是丹阳陵墓区进口处的装饰品。
    六朝陵墓石刻，分石柱、石兽和碑碣三种。石柱都作圆形或略带椭圆形，柱身上刻着隐陷的直刳瓜棱纹，普通称之为“希腊式”石柱；上面刻着神道碑，大书“某某之神道”；再上面是莲花纹的圆盖，盖上都立着一头小辟邪。这种作风，显然是受的印度古代佛教艺术中阿育王石柱的影响。石兽分石辟邪（无角）、石麒麟（独角）和石天禄（双角）三种，大概帝王陵墓前面都是左边天禄，右边麒麟，而王侯墓前则都是一对辟邪。石兽身上都有翅膀，装饰华丽，有人认为这是受的古代“亚述”有翼兽雕刻的影响。碑碣保存的比较少，但即以现在保存的萧憺墓碑和萧宏墓碑而论，规模都十分宏大。萧宏墓碑侧面有雕刻八方，上面刻着神话人物和动物，形象极为生动。它们的风格，同东汉武梁石室和沂南古墓画像石的石刻相近，是六朝陵墓石刻中难得的浮雕。但是可惜碑文本身，因为年代久远，频经风雨剥蚀，大多已经看不清楚了。萧憺的墓碑，保存得比较完整，是吴兴贝义渊所书。近代有一位金石家，叫做莫友芝，说它“较北魏诸刻，格韵相等，而稍朗润，盖南北大同小异处。”又说它“上承钟（繇）、王（羲之），下开欧（阳询）、薛（稷）”（都是有名的书法家），他的评价是极高的。这样的弯碑巨制，文字长到好几千，都是恭楷写成，而且笔画朗润，笔力挺拔，尤可以看出书法家的造诣。
    现存六朝陵墓石刻，为我国雕塑史上的瑰宝。因为这些雕刻，有关东西文化交流，所以为国际考古学者所注意。从前帝国主义分子曾千方百计，企图加以盗窃。1935至1936年伦敦举行“中国艺术国际展览会”，内有六朝陵墓石麒麟一件（图片编号2361），四腿和尾已断，仅存头部和躯壳，是美国送去参加展出的。观其作风，雄浑沉着，显然是六朝初期刘宋时代的作品，被美帝国主义者盗去。这现存的二十九处六朝陵墓石刻，实在是祖国文物的宝贵遗产。我们论及中国南北朝时代的雕塑，大多以佛像雕塑为主要材料，而这一大批石刻则是佛教艺术以外的大宗作品。有了它们，上可以探讨汉代的石刻，下可以观察唐代陵墓的各种石兽，其意义之重要，是不言而喻的。这次江苏省修复六朝陵墓石刻，是值得加以介绍的文物工作之一。希望今后的文物管理机关，妥善加以保管。（附图片）
