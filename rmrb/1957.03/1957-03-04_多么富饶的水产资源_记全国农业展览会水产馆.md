What Abundant Aquatic Resources
    -- A Record of the Aquatic Products Hall of the National Agricultural Exhibition
    By our reporter Ai Ling

    How many people loved to listen to the myths of the "Sea Dragon King" and the "Crystal Palace" in their childhood? The sea, how wonderful and touching! The sea leaves people with mysterious and interesting fantasies!
    In the Aquatic Products Hall of the National Agricultural Exhibition, we saw the secrets of the seabed with our own eyes.
    Under the sea, just like on land, there are tropics and frigid zones. Many animals and plants live in the water in upper, middle, and lower layers separately. Here are fierce sharks, huge whales, fish with sharp mouths like awls that can pierce wooden boats, as well as beautiful golden threadfin bream, redfish as red as a bride, tiger fish like flying birds, and colorful ornamental fish. This is truly like a world of fish. And the dizzying red corals, colorful starfish, chrysanthemum-like sea anemones, and all kinds of seaweed and shells...set off the seabed like a beautiful and tranquil garden. Grouper always like to dance around the coral, and flounder float up and down like a light boat. Schools of fish arrange their lives according to their own interests: skipjack tuna are happy to live in the tropics; squid like to travel long distances; eels are willing to be born in rivers, and only return to the sea when they grow up; yellow croaker and prawns return to the Bohai Sea in China every year in April and May to spawn, and after autumn, the small fish grow up and return to the deep sea to spend the winter. Fish are very good at protecting themselves and have weapons of self-defense. You see the sea anemone, which is beautiful and quiet, lying there, but when a creature approaches it, countless soft bodies will squirm to suck it. The markings of the reeves shad often change color, and the cuttlefish uses the black ink ejected from its abdominal cavity... They live together in the sea, and the sea is full of life.
    Schools of fish like to live and migrate in places where warm and cold currents meet, because these places are rich in bait and the water temperature and climate are suitable for the growth of fish. China's coast has many good fishing ports, especially in the excellent fishing grounds within 200 meters of water depth, which cover 436,000 square li, concentrating more than 1,500 kinds of fish, including yellow croaker, hairtail, cuttlefish, reeves shad, flounder, porgy, redfish, cod, mackerel, shark... and other economically valuable and high-yielding species. The vast shallow sea beaches are even richer in kelp, agar, deer horn seaweed, laver, and glittering shellfish.
    Freshwater fish living in rivers, lakes, and ponds are like a harmonious family: silver carp and bighead carp always swim on the top of the water because they love to eat plankton; grass carp that like to eat grass, black carp and carp that like to eat snails swim in the middle and lower layers; lively carp prefer to swim to the lower layer to "dig the bottom of the pond."
    In the Aquatic Products Hall, people saw the rapid development of China's aquatic products industry with joy. China has not only begun to manufacture fishing trawlers and motorized sailing boats, but also has mixed-type fishing trawlers and whaling trawlers with complete telecommunications equipment. In 1956, the production capacity of fishing vessel manufacturing increased by 474% compared with 1954. What is particularly attractive here is the "fish finder." When the narrator presses the button, the finder can detect the flashing schools of fish.
    In the past, many things that people dared not even think about have now been realized. In the past, the lives of fishermen were precarious, and many fishermen were buried in the sea. However, only today has the People's Government attached importance to the lives and safety of fishermen. Today, there are weather forecasts, and many storm warning stations, radios, light poles, buoys...etc. have been set up in coastal fishing areas, and some areas are building breakwaters, which greatly reduces maritime accidents.
    There are several vigorous mass fishing boats on display here. The most interesting is the "mother-child red fish fishing boat." The boat is equipped with more than 20 small boats. In one night, it can catch 4,500 catties of highly economically valuable red fish, which is currently the largest fishing boat in China. The exhibition also tells us that fishermen now have their own motorized sailing boats. We saw a 44-horsepower motorized sailing boat from fishermen in Zhoushan, Zhejiang, which can travel six or seven nautical miles per hour, and its production volume is three to five times higher than that of ordinary sailing boats.
    Another significant achievement in China's aquatic products industry is the development of fisheries scientific research. For many years, people believed that kelp could only grow on the seabed, and they all used the method of "naturally propagating by throwing stones on the seabed." As a result, the yield was low, and a storm would cause great losses. Today, the Luda Aquatic Products Breeding Farm has created surface kelp planting, eliminating the need to sink to the seabed for planting and harvesting. Diseases such as gill disease, parasitic disease, and gastroenteritis in fish, which were incurable in the past, have now been basically eradicated. And there are new creations in the scientific cultivation of fish fry. What an exciting thing!
    Here, we also saw that fish scales, fish intestines, fish bones, fish heads... and other waste materials can be supplied to agriculture, industry, and medicine. We saw movie film, medicinal pills, exquisite penholders, stiff collars... all made of fish scale gelatin. China also has new-type fishmeal factories, using fish intestines, fish heads, and fish bones to make fishmeal, which is a good livestock feed and fertilizer for fruit trees. There are also beautifully colored leather shoes and suitcases with natural patterns. If it weren't for the narrator's explanation, how would we know that they are made of shark skin!
    People are surrounding this model of "integrated fish farming" that makes full use of all water surfaces, revealing their inner joy. From here, we learned that not only can freshwater fish be raised in lakes, rivers, and ponds, but also in reservoirs and rice fields. Freshwater fish, with their delicious meat and low price, are indispensable non-staple foods for the broad masses of the people. Moreover, freshwater fish have very rich resources in China. There are currently more than 500 species, and the area for freshwater fish farming is estimated to be 160 million mu, not including rice-fish farming. Therefore, freshwater fish farming has great development prospects.
    In recent years, China's aquatic products industry has made great progress. In 1956, aquatic products production had reached 174.22% of the highest pre-war level. However, freshwater areas have not been fully utilized, and the current utilization rate is only 16%; aquatic resources have not been well protected, and a large number of parent fish are captured in many fish-producing areas; some backward fishing tools also damage aquatic resources to some extent. The Xijiang River in Guangdong is one of China's important fish fry areas. Due to the indiscriminate capture of spawning parent fish by the masses, the output of fish fry has declined year by year, and the output of fish fry in 1956 was less than one-third of that in 1952. How alarming this is!

    多么富饶的水产资源
    ——记全国农业展览会水产馆
    本报记者  艾玲
    多少人在童年时代爱听“海龙王”、“水晶宫”的神话。海，多么美妙感人！海，给人留下了神秘有趣的幻想！
    在全国农业展览会的水产馆里，我们亲眼看到了海底的秘密。
    在海底，也像陆地一样，有热带和寒带之分，许多动物和植物分开上、中、下层次安居在水里。这里有凶猛的鲨鱼，庞大的鲸鱼，有嘴巴尖的像锥子一样能把木船刺穿的?鱼，也有好看的金线鱼、红得像个新娘子似的红鱼、飞鸟似的虎鱼，还有五光十色的观赏鱼。这里真像是鱼的世界。而那晕红的珊瑚，彩色的海星，菊花似的海葵，以及各色各样的海草、贝壳……把海底衬托得像一座美丽而恬静的花园。石班鱼总是喜欢围着珊瑚旋舞，比目鱼像一叶轻舟忽高忽低地飘浮着。鱼群都按着自己的兴趣安排生活：鲣鱼高兴住在热带；鱿鱼喜欢作远距离旅行；海鳗愿意在河里出生，长大后才回到大海去；黄花鱼和对虾每年4、5月回到我国渤海来产卵，秋后小鱼长大了又回到深海过冬。鱼类很会保护自己，随身都有自卫的武器。你看那海葵又好看又安静伏在那里，但生物一靠近它，无数的软体就会蠕动起来吸吮。鳓鱼的花纹经常变色，乌贼利用腹腔里吐出的黑墨……它们共同生活在海里，海是充满了生命的。
    鱼群最喜欢在寒暖流汇合的地方栖息和洄游，因为这些地方饵料丰富，水温气候适合鱼的生长。我国沿海有许多良好的渔港，特别是在水深二百公尺以内的优良渔场有四十三万六千平方里，集中鱼类一千五百多种，其中黄花鱼、带鱼、墨鱼、鳓鱼、比目鱼、鲷鱼、红鱼、鳕鱼、鲐鱼、鲨鱼……等经济价值高而产量大。广大浅海滩生长的海带、石菜花、鹿角菜、紫菜和金光闪闪的贝类更是丰富。
    生活在江河湖泊池塘的淡水鱼，像个和睦的大家庭：鲢鱼和鱇鱼因为爱吃浮游生物，老是游在水的上边；喜欢吃草的草鱼，爱吃螺丝的青鱼、鲤鱼在中下层游动；性情活跃的鲤鱼，更喜欢游到下层“挖塘底”。
    在水产馆里，人们怀着喜悦的心情，看到了我国水产事业迅速发展的情况。我国不仅开始制造捕渔轮船、机帆船，还有了完整电讯设备的混合式渔轮船，捕鲸轮船。1956年，渔轮制造业的生产能力比1954年增长了474％。在这里，特别吸引人注意的是“鱼群测探器”，讲解员把电钮一按，测探器就能探到一闪一闪的鱼群。
    过去，许多连想都不敢想的事情，竟在今天实现了。过去渔民生命朝不保夕，多少渔民葬身在大海里。但是，也只有今天，人民政府才重视了渔民的生命和安全。今天有了天气预报，沿海渔区设立了很多的暴风警报站、收音机、灯柱、浮标……等，有的地区在修建避风堤，海上事故大大的减少了。
    这里陈列着几只矫健的群众捕鱼船。最有趣的是那只“母子式钓红鱼船”，船里装了二十多只小艇，一个晚上，可以钓到经济价值很高的红鱼四千五百斤，这是我国目前钓船中规模最大的鱼船。展览会还告诉我们，目前，渔民还有了自己的机帆船。我们看到浙江舟山渔民的一只四十四马力的机帆船，每小时能走六七海里，生产量比一般帆船高三至五倍。
    我国水产事业上的另一个显著成就，是渔业科学研究工作的发展。多少年来，人们认为海带只能生长在海底，都是用“海底投石自然繁殖”的办法，结果产量低，遇上一场风害，损失很大。而今天，旅大水产养殖场竟创造海面种植海带，不用再沉到海底里去种植和收割了。过去没法治的鱼腮病、寄生虫病和肠胃炎等病害，现在已经基本上根绝了。而对科学培育鱼种，更有新的创造。这是多么激动人的事呵！
    在这里，我们还看到鱼鳞、鱼肠、鱼骨、鱼头……等废弃物都可以供给农业、工业、医药上的需要。我们看到电影胶片、制药丸、精美的钢笔杆、硬领子……都是鱼鳞胶制成的。我国还有了新型的鱼粉厂，利用鱼肠、鱼头、鱼骨制成的鱼粉，是一种很好的牲畜饲料和果树的肥料。这里还有颜色美妙有着天然花纹的皮鞋和皮箱，如果不是讲解员的说明，我们又怎能知道它是用鲨鱼皮制成的呢！
    人们围着这个利用一切水面“综合养鱼”的模型，流露出内心的喜悦。从这里我们知道了，不仅在湖泊、河流和池塘里可以养淡水鱼，而且在水库和稻田里都能养鱼。淡水鱼，肉味鲜美，价钱便宜，是广大人民不可缺少的副食品。而且淡水鱼在我国有非常丰富的资源，目前有五百多种，淡水养鱼面积估计有一亿六千万亩，稻田养鱼还不计算在内。因此，淡水养鱼是很有发展前途的。
    几年来，我国水产事业有很大发展，1956年水产生产已经相当战前最高水平的174.22％。但是，淡水面积还未充分利用，目前利用面只达16％；水产资源还没有得到很好的保护，许多鱼产区的亲鱼被大量捕捉；有些落后的捕鱼工具，在某种程度上也损害了水产资源。广东西江是我国重要鱼苗区之一，由于群众滥捕产卵亲鱼，造成鱼苗逐年下降，1956年的鱼苗产量还不到1952年的三分之一。这是多么值得警惕呵！
