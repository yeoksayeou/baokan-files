Strengthening the Work of Probationary Party Members
Commentator of this Newspaper

　　In accordance with the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Party to further improve the quality of Party members, strengthening the assessment and education of probationary Party members and conscientiously handling the issue of probationary Party members becoming formal Party members is an extremely important task for Party organizations. Doing a good job in the work of probationary Party members is an indispensable measure to improve the quality of Party members and ensure the purity of Party organizations. At present, this work is of particular importance. This is because our Party has admitted a large number of new Party members in the past one or two years, and probationary Party members account for a considerable proportion of our Party's members. Although the probationary Party members admitted by various localities are generally activists in socialist transformation and socialist construction, and have been selected and educated by Party organizations, the vast majority of them meet the requirements for joining the Party; however, some localities have admitted a large number of probationary Party members in a relatively short period of time, so the work has been done relatively roughly, and there are many problems among the probationary Party members. Some probationary Party members lack the necessary basic knowledge of how to be a Communist Party member, their level of awareness is not high, and they cannot play the due role of a Party member. There are also some probationary Party members who have relatively serious shortcomings and problems in their ideology and work style. Some are arrogant and complacent and treat the people with an incorrect attitude; some lack the moral qualities that a Communist Party member should have, and in production and work, they pick and choose, avoid hard work, fabricate facts, haggle over personal reputation and status, pursue personal enjoyment, and a few even have phenomena of corruption, degeneration, and moral depravity. The large number of probationary Party members and the actual situation of having many problems require Party organizations at all levels to devote more time and energy to effectively strengthen the work of probationary Party members.

　　Many local Party organizations attach importance to the work of probationary Party members. However, many Party organizations do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of this work. Some Party organizations believe that they have already done some work before admitting probationary Party members; after admission, they just wait for the expiration to go through the formalities of becoming a formal member. Some Party organizations do not notify the probationary Party members who have been approved for admission for several months, nor do they include them in the Party organization. Some Party organizations do not assign appropriate work to probationary Party members in order to assess and educate them in their actual work. Some Party organizations and introducers do not care about the ideological situation of probationary Party members, and do not check, criticize, or provide timely assistance to the shortcomings and mistakes that occur in probationary Party members after they join the Party, so that the shortcomings and mistakes of some probationary Party members not only have not been corrected during the probationary period, but have instead developed. Some probationary Party members reflect that "after joining the Party, they receive less education from the Party than before joining the Party," and "after joining the Party, no one cares about them." It should be admitted that there are indeed such problems in many places regarding the work of probationary Party members.

　　Another problem in the work of probationary Party members is that the time for many probationary Party members to become formal members has been delayed for no reason, some have been delayed for a year or two, and individual cases have even reached five or six years. Shandong, Anhui, Inner Mongolia, Zhejiang, Liaoning and other places all found last year probationary Party members who joined the Party before or in the early days of the national liberation but have not yet resolved the issue of becoming formal members. Even in places where the formalities for becoming formal members can be handled on time, the work of becoming formal members has become a mere formality due to the lack of assessment and education of probationary Party members, and people who do not meet the requirements for Party membership are casually made formal Party members. Among the Party members who were approved to become formal members by seven branches of the Luoyang Tractor Factory, an inspection revealed that thirteen people should not have been made formal Party members, and the political history problems of five of them had not been clearly investigated. Obviously, this is incompatible with the Party's spirit of improving the quality of Party members.

　　Admitting activists as probationary Party members is only the first step in completing the work of admitting Party members; effectively educating probationary Party members and assessing whether they possess the class consciousness and moral qualities that a Party member should possess to determine whether they can become formal Party members is another indispensable step in the work of admitting Party members. The experience of various localities proves that the effort that Party organizations put into assessing and educating probationary Party members should not be less than the effort used to admit a probationary Party member. In some places where the work of admitting probationary Party members is done roughly, more effort must be used. Paying attention only to admitting probationary Party members and not paying attention to working on probationary Party members is a concrete manifestation of the erroneous ideology of emphasizing quantity over quality. Any neglect of the quality of the Party will be detrimental to the consolidation of the Party organization and detrimental to our socialist construction cause.

　　In order to do a good job in the work of probationary Party members, Party organizations must take effective measures to strengthen the assessment and education of probationary Party members during their probationary period. In this regard, various localities have gained a lot of experience. For example, promptly incorporate probationary Party members into Party organizations so that they can be educated and trained by the Party in strict Party life. According to the specific circumstances of probationary Party members, adopt methods such as centralized training, regularly attending Party classes, or assigning documents to organize them to study on their own to educate them on the Party Constitution. Assign introducers or designated formal Party members to be responsible for providing individual assistance to probationary Party members during the probationary period, and at the same time educate all formal Party members to care about probationary Party members and help them specifically understand what kind of position, viewpoint, and method a Communist Party member should use to observe things and handle problems. For individual probationary Party members with unclear history, individual assistance can also be used to investigate clearly the political history that has not been clarified. It is also possible to assign probationary Party members work that they can handle and test whether they can overcome difficulties and fulfill their Party member obligations in their actual work. Because, when admitting probationary Party members, they can only be required to acknowledge and fulfill the obligations of Party members; after they join the Party, they can be required to fulfill the obligations of Party members stipulated in the Party Constitution and test them. In addition to these methods, other effective methods can also be adopted. Some Party organizations have many probationary Party members, and the higher-level Party committee should send people or designate Party members to work in this unit to help them strengthen the work of probationary Party members.

　　The issue of probationary Party members becoming formal Party members must be handled seriously in accordance with the spirit of improving the quality of Party members. When the probationary period of a probationary Party member expires, the Party organization should carefully review their actual performance during the probationary period in accordance with the Party's spirit of raising the standards for Party members and handle their issue of becoming formal members separately. For probationary Party members who meet the requirements for Party membership at the time of joining the Party and have improved during the probationary period, or probationary Party members who did not fully meet the requirements for Party membership at the time of joining the Party, but have improved their ideological awareness and corrected their shortcomings and problems during the probationary period and already meet the requirements for Party membership, they should be made formal Party members, and at the same time point out the direction of their future efforts and require them to constantly improve themselves. For those who did not fully meet the requirements at the time of joining the Party and have not fully met the requirements for Party membership during the probationary period, or who met the requirements for Party membership at the time of joining the Party but have serious shortcomings and problems during the probationary period, or who, after the actual test of the probationary period, cannot play the due role of a Party member, if they are willing to improve themselves and correct their shortcomings and problems, their probationary period can be extended in accordance with the Party Constitution; those who cannot improve or refuse to reform should have their probationary Party member status revoked. Various bad elements who are found to have infiltrated the Party during the probationary period should have their probationary Party member status revoked at any time as long as the facts are fully verified, in order to maintain the purity of the Party organization. Party organizations should take effective measures to ensure that their issue of becoming formal members is discussed in a timely manner when the probationary period expires. However, some Party organizations have relaxed the assessment and education of probationary Party members in the past, and they still lack understanding of these probationary Party members when their probationary period expires. At this time, do not rush to go through the formalities of becoming formal members in order to avoid lowering the quality of Party members. Party organizations should first strengthen the assessment and education of these probationary Party members, and persuade them to consciously and voluntarily continue to accept the Party's assessment and education for the benefit of the Party, strive to improve themselves, and earnestly correct their shortcomings. This should be especially noted in places where there are many probationary Party members. Because only when the Party organization has effectively assessed and educated probationary Party members and truly understands their situation can it discuss the issue of probationary Party members becoming formal members on time, and can it truly achieve the goal of improving the quality of Party members.

### 加强预备党员工作

　　加强预备党员工作
　　本报评论员
    按照党的第八次代表大会更加提高党员质量的精神，加强对预备党员的考察和教育工作，认真地处理预备党员转为正式党员的问题，是党组织的一项极其重要的任务。做好预备党员工作，是提高党员质量，保证党组织的纯洁必不可缺少的措施。在目前这项工作更具有特别重要的意义。这是因为，我们的党在最近一、二年的时间里，接收了大量的新党员，在我们党的成员中，预备党员占着相当大的比重。各地所接收的预备党员，虽然一般地都是社会主义改造和社会主义建设中的积极分子，经过了党组织的挑选和教育，绝大多数是具备入党条件的；但是，有些地方由于在较短的时间里，接收了大批预备党员，工作就作得比较粗糙，在预备党员中是有不少问题的。有一部分预备党员对于怎样做一个共产党员没有必要的基本知识，觉悟水平不高，不能起到一个党员的应有作用。还有些预备党员思想作风方面有比较严重的缺点和毛病，有的骄傲自满，以不正确的态度对待人民群众；有的缺乏共产党员应有的道德品质，在生产和工作中，挑肥拣瘦，挑轻躲重，弄虚作假，斤斤计较个人的名誉地位，追求个人的享受，个别人还有腐化堕落、道德败坏的现象。预备党员数量大，问题较多的实际情况，要求各级党组织拿出更多的时间和更大的力量，切实加强预备党员工作。
    对于预备党员工作，很多地方的党组织是重视的。但是，也有不少的党组织，由于对这一工作的重要意义认识不足。有些党组织认为在接收预备党员以前，已经做了一些工作；接收以后，就只等着到期办个转正手续。有的党组织，对于已经批准接收的预备党员，几个月不通知本人，不编入党的组织。有的党组织不给预备党员分配适当的工作，以便在实际工作中考察教育他们。有的党组织和入党介绍人，不关心预备党员的思想状况，对于预备党员在入党以后所发生的缺点和错误，不检查，不批评，不及时地给予帮助，以致有些预备党员的缺点和错误，在预备期间不但没有改正，反而有了发展。有的预备党员反映：“入党以后反而不如入党以前受到党的教育多”，“入党以后没有人管了”。应当承认，不少地方对预备党员的工作确实存在着这样的问题。
    预备党员工作中的另一个问题，就是很多预备党员的转正时间被无故拖延了，有的被拖长了一年，两年，个别的甚至达到五、六年。山东、安徽、内蒙古、浙江、辽宁等地在去年都曾经检查出在全国解放以前或解放初期入党，而至今尚未解决转正问题的预备党员。就是能够按期办理转正手续的地方，也由于对预备党员疏于考察和教育，而使转正工作流于形式，把不具备党员条件的人，马马虎虎转为正式党员。洛阳拖拉机厂七个支部通过转正的党员中，经检查有十三人是不应该转为正式党员的，其中有五个人的政治历史问题没有审查清楚。很显然，这是同党的提高党员质量的精神不相容的。
    把积极分子接收为预备党员，只是完成了接收党员工作的第一步；对预备党员切实地进行教育，考察他们是否具备一个党员应该具备的阶级觉悟和道德品质，来确定他们能否转为正式党员，这是接收党员工作不可缺少的另一个步骤。各地的经验证明：党组织对预备党员进行考察教育工作所用的力量，不应该比接收一个预备党员所用的力量为少。在接收预备党员工作做得粗糙的某些地方，就必须要用更多的力量。只注意接收预备党员，不注意对预备党员进行工作，是重数量轻质量的错误思想的具体表现。而对于党的质量的任何忽视，都将有害于党组织的巩固，有害于我们的社会主义建设事业。
    为了做好预备党员工作，党组织必须采取有效措施，加强对预备党员在预备期间的考察教育工作。在这方面，各地已经取得不少经验。比如，及时将预备党员编入党的组织，使他们在严格的党的生活中受到党的教育和锻炼。根据预备党员的具体情况，分别采用集中训练、定期上党课或者指定文件组织他们自学等办法，对他们进行党章教育。责成入党介绍人或指定正式党员，分工负责对预备党员在预备期间进行个别帮助，同时教育所有的正式党员都关心预备党员，帮助他们具体了解一个共产党员应该用什么样的立场、观点、方法去观察事物，处理问题。对个别历史不清的预备党员，也可以用个别帮助的方法，把没有弄清楚的政治历史情况，考察清楚。还可以分配预备党员力能胜任的工作，在实际工作中，考验他们能否克服困难，履行党员义务。因为，在接收预备党员的时候，只能要求他们承认履行党员的义务；在他们入党以后，就可以按照党章规定的党员义务来要求他们，考验他们。除这些办法外，还可以采取其他有效的做法。有些党组织的预备党员很多，上级党委应该派人或指定到这个单位进行工作的党员，帮助他们加强对预备党员的工作。
    对于预备党员转为正式党员的问题，必须根据提高党员质量的精神，严肃地进行处理。党的组织在预备党员预备期满的时候，应当根据他们在预备期间的实际表现，按照党的提高党员标准的精神，认真地进行审查，分别地处理他们的转正问题。对于在入党时具备党员条件，在预备期间有了提高的预备党员，或者在入党时不完全具备党员条件，而在预备期间提高了思想觉悟程度，改正了缺点毛病，已经具备党员条件的预备党员，应该使他们转为正式党员，同时给他们指出今后努力的方向，要求他们不断地提高自己。对于在入党时不完全具备条件，在预备期间也还没有完全具备党员条件，或者在入党时具备党员条件，在预备期间发生严重缺点和毛病，或者经过预备期的实际考验，不能起一个党员应有的作用的预备党员，如果他们愿意提高自己，改正缺点和毛病，可以按照党章规定延长他们的预备期；对那些不能提高的或者拒绝改造的，应当取消他们的预备党员资格。在预备期间查出来的混入党内的各种坏分子，只要把事实完全查对清楚，应当随时取消他们的预备党员资格，以保持党组织的纯洁。党组织应该采取有效措施，保证在预备期满的时候，及时地讨论他们的转正问题。但是，有的党组织因为过去放松了对预备党员的考察和教育，在这些预备党员预备期满的时候，对这些预备党员还缺少了解，这时候就不要急于去办理转正手续，以免降低党员质量。党组织应该首先加强对这些预备党员的考察和教育，并且说服他们为了党的利益自觉自愿地继续接受党的考察教育，努力提高自己，切实改正缺点。在预备党员数量很多的地方，对于这一点尤其应该注意。因为党组织只有切实地对预备党员进行了考察教育，真正地了解了他们的状况，才能按时讨论预备党员的转正工作，才能确实达到提高党员质量的目的。
