Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 27th: The "Literary Gazette" published a letter from writer Ehrenburg on the 23rd, in which Ehrenburg raised a different opinion about the statement that "America has not created a unique and true national culture."

On February 28th, the "Literary Gazette" published an article written by Professor Kazim-Bek, who lived in the United States for fifteen years and taught at the University of Connecticut. This author, who recently returned to the Soviet Union, talked about the phenomenon of cultural degradation and poverty in the United States. The author wrote in the article: "The United States has not created a unique and true national culture. Naturally, no one denies that the democratic and humanistic traditions in American political thought and literature of the past are rich. But unfortunately, this tradition has been forgotten."

Ehrenburg disagreed with this view. He said that in order to check whether this judgment is correct, it is not necessary to cross the Atlantic, just go to the bookshelf. Scholars can cite many American names that have enriched world culture. As a writer, I understand the role of American literature. Can the role of Whitman be denied and the national characteristics of his poems be disputed? Soviet readers clearly know that Mark Twain and Jack London attracted the attention of world readers between the two world wars.

Ehrenburg said: We oppose certain Western political groups spreading hostility and distrust among the people of all countries and hindering cultural cooperation. Therefore, I think it is necessary to oppose that article. It is possible and should expose the State Department's measures against peace; it is possible and should criticize various ugly phenomena in American society; it is possible and should oppose racism and McCarthyism; but it is not possible to slander valuable things that a nation can justifiably be proud of. Soviet people are educated in the spirit of respecting the national culture of any nation, big or small.

Some American political groups are attempting to intensify world tensions, attempting to make American culture monopolize everything, and attempting to deny the culture of other nations. We have opposed, are opposing, and will continue to vehemently oppose this attempt.

The "Literary Gazette" attached an editor's note after this letter, believing that this letter's evaluation of Kazim-Bek's article was not sufficiently based. The note said that the "Literary Gazette" has consistently agreed to expand world cultural ties and promote Soviet-American cultural exchanges. Publishing Kazim-Bek's article is by no means contradictory to this line. This article is an impression of an eyewitness, who resided in the United States in recent years—years that were very heavy and dark for American culture. Kazim-Bek's article, as a testimony from someone who observed modern American reality, is of interest to Soviet readers.

### 美国有没有创造出真正的民族文化？　爱伦堡和卡齐姆—贝克有争论

　　美国有没有创造出真正的民族文化？
　　爱伦堡和卡齐姆—贝克有争论
    新华社莫斯科27日电　“文学报”23日发表了作家爱伦堡的一封信，爱伦堡对于说“美国没有创造出独有的真正的民族文化”的说法提出了不同的意见。
      2月28日，“文学报”登载了一篇文章，这篇文章是在美国住了十五年的、曾在美国康涅狄格大学任教的教授卡齐姆—贝克写的。这位不久前回到苏联的作者谈到了美国文化的堕落和贫乏的现象。作者在文章中写道：“美国没有创造出独有的真正的民族文化。自然，谁也不否认，美国过去的政治思想和文学中民主的人道主义的传统是丰富的。但可惜这种传统被遗忘了。”
    爱伦堡不同意这种看法。他说，为了要检查这种判断是否正当，不需要横渡大西洋，仅仅走到书架前就够了。学者们能够举出许多丰富了世界文化的美国人的名字。作为作家，我了解美国文学的作用如何。能否认惠特曼的作用和对他的诗的民族特点发生争论吗？苏联读者清楚地知道马克·吐温和杰克·伦敦在两次世界大战之间引起的世界读者的注意。
    爱伦堡说：我们反对某些西方政治集团在各国人民中间散布敌视和不信任，阻挠文化合作，因此，我认为必须反对那篇文章。可以而且应该揭露国务院反对和平的措施；可以而且应该批评美国社会中各种丑恶现象；可以而且应该反对种族主义和麦卡锡主义；但是不可以诋毁一个民族可以正当地引以自豪的有价值的事物。苏联人是在尊重任何大小民族的民族文化的精神下受教育的。
    一些美国政治集团企图加剧世界紧张局势，企图使美国文化垄断一切，企图否认其他民族的文化。我们对这种企图过去、现在和将来都会给予猛烈的反对。
      “文学报”在这封信后附了一个编辑部按语，认为这封信对卡齐姆—贝克的文章的这种估价没有足够的根据。按语说，“文学报”一直不变地赞同扩大世界文化联系，赞同苏美两国文化交流。登载卡齐姆—贝克的文章，绝不和这种路线矛盾。这篇文章是目击者的印象，他曾经在最近年代——对于美国文化来说非常沉重和黑暗的年代——居留在美国。卡齐姆—贝克的文章，作为观察了美国现代现实的人证，对苏联读者是有兴趣的。
