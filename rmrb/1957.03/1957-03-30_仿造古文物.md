　　Imitating Ancient Cultural Relics
　　Mao Jinsheng
　　Liulichang, outside Hepingmen in Beijing, has various antique shops and bookstores, gathering countless unearthed cultural relics and historical and craft product materials. People absorb a lot of knowledge from here, but in the past, many people bought fakes at high prices here and were fooled. After liberation, antique dealers gradually changed their business style, marking the age of the cultural relics displayed on the shelves, whether genuine or fake. At the same time, they also established a processing and reproduction department. However, the processing and reproduction department is no longer for deceiving people for profit, but to sell these imitations at low prices to museums and universities across the country, to meet the needs of the people to march towards science and culture and enrich their knowledge.
　　In this processing and reproduction department, many broken cultural relics are restored to their original state after being repaired by artists; there are many imitation cultural relics, such as prehistoric forms of painted pottery, black pottery and white pottery from the late Neolithic period, white-bodied pottery from the Han Dynasty, tri-color glazed pottery from the Tang Dynasty, bronze zun and yi from the Shang and Zhou Dynasties, bronze mirrors from the Qin and Han Dynasties, stone carvings from the Six Dynasties and the Tang Dynasty, and clay sculptures from Dunhuang. Even experts, if they are not well-cultivated, would not dare to be sure of their authenticity for a while.

　　仿造古文物
    毛金笙
    北京和平门外的琉璃厂，有各类古玩店和古书店，麇集着无数出土文物及历史和工艺品资料。人们从这里吸取到许多知识，但过去也有不少人从这里用高价买过伪造品，上过当。解放后，文物商逐渐改变了经营作风，把陈列在架子上的文玩古物标明了年代，真品或伪造，同时还成立了一个加工复制部。但是，加工复制部已经不是为了骗人牟利，而是为了把这些仿制品用低廉的代价卖给各地的博物馆和高等学校，满足人民向科学文化进军的需要，丰富他们的知识。
    在这个加工复制部里，许多破碎不堪的文物经过艺人修整后，恢复了原状；有许多仿制的文物，如史前各种形式的彩陶、新石器末期的黑陶和白陶，汉代的白胎陶、唐代的三彩釉陶、商周的青铜尊彝、秦汉的铜镜、六朝和唐朝的石刻、敦煌的泥塑等等，即使是内行，如果修养不到家，一时也不敢肯定出它们的真伪。
