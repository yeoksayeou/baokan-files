Comrade Premier, esteemed comrades of the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic, comrades and friends:

Today, we gather in our nation's capital, Beijing, to welcome the respected friend of the Chinese people, the representative of the glorious Czechoslovak people, Premier Široký of the Czechoslovak Republic, and all the comrades of the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic, on their visit to our country. With great excitement, I, on behalf of all the people of Beijing, extend a warm welcome and heartfelt respect to Comrade Premier and all the comrades of the delegation.

Last December, a delegation from the Beijing Municipal People's Committee and the National People's Congress paid a friendly visit to the Czechoslovak Republic. During our visit, we witnessed firsthand how the hardworking and creative Czechoslovak people, under the leadership of the glorious Czechoslovak Communist Party, were building their country with selfless labor and had already achieved great success. Today, the Czechoslovak Republic is already a highly industrialized socialist country. The Czechoslovak people are now implementing the second Five-Year Plan for further development of the national economy. The successful realization of this plan will further improve the development of the Czechoslovak national economy and the living standards of the people. The great economic achievements of the Czechoslovak Republic eloquently demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system.

In international affairs, the Czechoslovak Republic, together with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, has steadfastly pursued a policy of peace. It has consistently adhered to the principles of proletarian internationalism, firmly upholding the close unity and friendly cooperation between socialist countries, led by the Soviet Union. This great unity and cooperation is a reliable guarantee for safeguarding the construction endeavors of socialist countries and maintaining world peace. The Czechoslovak Republic has also made significant contributions to easing international tensions and safeguarding peace in Europe and the world. The Chinese people are greatly encouraged by these brilliant achievements of the fraternal Czechoslovak people.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples has been continuously deepening and consolidating. With the upsurge of socialist construction in both countries, our fraternal relations of mutual assistance and cooperation have also been strengthening and developing day by day. The government and people of the Czechoslovak Republic have not only consistently supported the Chinese people's struggle to safeguard their sovereignty but have also provided sincere assistance to our socialist construction. In recent years, the Czechoslovak Republic has not only supplied our country with many complete sets of equipment and industrial materials but has also sent many outstanding experts to help us with industrial construction and train technical personnel. Last year, the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic also donated a complete set of equipment for a state-owned farm to our country. On behalf of the people of Beijing and the whole country, I would like to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt gratitude to Comrade Premier and all the comrades of the delegation, and through you, to the Government and people of the Czechoslovak Republic, for the support and assistance you have given to our country.

The mutual visits of leaders of the Parties and Governments of China and Czechoslovakia are also an important manifestation of our close relationship. Last year, the delegation of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, headed by Comrade Kopecký, was invited to participate in the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, and his previous visit to our country left a deep impression in the hearts of our people. Vice Chairman Zhu De of our country, as well as the delegation of the National People's Congress and the delegation of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, including myself, also paid friendly visits to the Czechoslovak Republic. During our visit, we were warmly welcomed and cordially received by the Czechoslovak Government and people everywhere, and we were deeply moved by this sincere fraternal friendship. This visit to our country by the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic, headed by Comrade Široký, will surely further strengthen the profound friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples, strengthen the great unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and will be conducive to the noble cause of world peace and human progress.

Esteemed Comrade Široký and all the comrades of the delegation, please allow me to once again extend a warm welcome to you on behalf of all the people of Beijing, and I hope you will give us your criticism and suggestions regarding the shortcomings in our work.

Comrades, friends, let us shout:

Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples!

Long live the great unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live world peace!

    在北京市各界人民欢迎大会上
    彭真市长的讲话敬爱的总理同志敬爱的捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团的全体同志们同志们，朋友们：
    今天，在我国的首都——北京举行集会，欢迎中国人民敬爱的朋友、光荣的捷克斯洛伐克人民的代表、捷克斯洛伐克共和国总理西罗基同志和捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团的全体同志们来到我国访问，我怀着十分兴奋的心情代表北京市全体人民，向总理同志和代表团的全体同志们表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的敬意。
    去年12月，我们北京市人民委员会代表团和全国人民代表大会代表团曾经到捷克斯洛伐克共和国进行友好访问。在访问期间，我们亲眼看到勤劳的和富有创造性的捷克斯洛伐克人民在光荣的捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下，以忘我的劳动建设着自己的国家，并且已经取得了巨大的成就。今天，捷克斯洛伐克共和国已经是一个工业高度发展的社会主义国家。现在捷克斯洛伐克人民正在执行着进一步发展国民经济的第二个五年计划。这个计划的胜利实现，将使捷克斯洛伐克国民经济的发展和人民生活水平获得进一步的提高。捷克斯洛伐克共和国经济上的巨大成就，雄辩地证明了社会主义制度的优越性。
    在国际事务方面，捷克斯洛伐克共和国和苏联、各人民民主国家一道，坚持不渝地执行着和平的外交政策，它一贯地忠实于无产阶级国际主义原则，坚决地维护着以苏联为首的社会主义各国之间的紧密团结和友好合作。这种伟大的团结和合作是保障社会主义各国的建设事业、维护世界和平的可靠保证。捷克斯洛伐克共和国对缓和国际局势、保卫欧洲和世界和平的事业也作了重大的贡献。中国人民对兄弟的捷克斯洛伐克人民所取得的这些光辉的成就，感到十分欢欣鼓舞。
    自中华人民共和国成立以来，中捷两国人民兄弟般的友谊就在不断地加深和巩固，随着两国社会主义建设事业的高涨，我们两国兄弟般的互助合作关系也在日益加强和发展。捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府和人民不仅对中国人民维护自己主权的斗争给予一贯的支持，而且对我国的社会主义建设也给予真诚的援助。几年来，捷克斯洛伐克共和国不仅供应了我国许多成套设备和工业器材，而且还派来了许多优秀的专家，帮助我们进行工业建设和培养技术干部，去年捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府又赠给我国一个国营农场的整套设备。对于捷克斯洛伐克共和国给予我国的支持和帮助，我愿趁这个机会代表北京市和全国人民向总理同志和代表团全体同志们，并通过你们向捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府和人民表示衷心的感谢。
    中捷两国党和政府领导人员的相互访问，也是我们之间亲密关系的重要表现。去年以柯别茨基同志为首的捷克斯洛伐克共产党代表团应邀参加我国共产党第八次代表大会和他以前来我国的访问，都在我国人民的心中留下了深刻的印象，我国朱德副主席以及包括我在内的全国人民代表大会代表团和北京市人民委员会代表团，也曾前往捷克斯洛伐克共和国进行了友好的访问。在访问期间，我们到处都受到了捷克斯洛伐克政府和人民最热烈的欢迎和最亲切的接待，这种真挚的兄弟般的友谊使我们深受感动。这次以西罗基同志为首的捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团来我国的访问，一定会进一步加强中国人民和捷克斯洛伐克人民之间的深厚友谊，加强以苏联为首的社会主义国家的伟大团结，并将有利于世界和平和人类进步的崇高事业。
    敬爱的西罗基同志和代表团的全体同志们，请允许我再一次代表北京市全体人民向你们表示热烈的欢迎，并且希望你们对于我们工作中的缺点给予批评和指正。
    同志们，朋友们，让我们高呼：
    中捷两国人民牢不可破的友谊和团结万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义各国的强大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
