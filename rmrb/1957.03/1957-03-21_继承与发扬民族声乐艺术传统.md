        (I) Vocal Art with a Long History
    The vocal art of all nations initially originated from folk songs produced in the people's lives and labor. We are a country with thousands of years of history and culture. Since our ancestors, we have been a nation that loves singing and dancing. Ancient books have long recorded: "When men and women have grievances, they follow each other and sing. The hungry sing of their food, and the laborers sing of their work." (He Xiu's annotation to the fifteenth year of Duke Xuan of the Gongyang Commentary). And "If singing is not enough, unknowingly, hands will dance, and feet will stomp" (Preface to the Book of Poetry). For thousands of years, our ancestors created a very rich variety of folk songs.
    The Book of Poetry, Chu Ci, Yuefu, Tang Poetry, Song Ci, and Yuan Qu were the main art forms of singing in the past eras, and they all grew from the soil of folk songs. Since most of the musical scores before the Song Dynasty have not been passed down, only the literary parts remain. Some of them were originally oral creations by the people, and more were artistic works that poets imitated and processed based on folk song forms. The Book of Poetry is a collection of folk songs compiled by Confucius (551-479 BC) from more than 3,000 folk songs passed down from ancient times. The Records of the Grand Historian, Family of Confucius, states: "In ancient times, there were more than 3,000 poems. By the time of Confucius, he removed the repetitions and selected those that could be applied to rites and righteousness... 305 poems. Confucius all sang them with stringed instruments, seeking to harmonize with the sounds of Shao, Wu, Ya, and Song. From this, rites and music could be described, to prepare the way of the king and complete the six arts." Chu Ci is artistic poetry created by the great poet Qu Yuan 2,000 years ago by absorbing the nourishment of Chu folk songs. Wang Yi's preface to the Chapters of Nine Songs says: "In the past, in the towns south of the Chu state, between the Yuan and Xiang rivers, their custom was to believe in ghosts and love sacrifices. Their sacrifices always involved singing, music, drumming, and dancing to please the gods." The "Xiang Jun," "He Bo," and "Shan Gui" in Nine Songs are all the names of gods, so Nine Songs is a song for worshiping gods. Yuefu took shape in the early Han Dynasty. Emperor Wu of Han (140 BC) "established the Yuefu, collected poems for night recitations, with Zhao, Dai, Qin, and Chu tunes. He appointed Li Yannian as the Harmonization Commandant and had Sima Xiangru and dozens of others create poems and fu, briefly discussing the laws of music to harmonize the tones of the eight sounds and compose songs in nineteen chapters" (Book of Han, Records of Rites and Music). By the Northern and Southern Dynasties (386-589), Yuefu poetry evolved into long, narrative songs with rich popular appeal, such as "The Peacock Flies Southeast" and "Ballad of Mulan," which are representative works of this song form. The Tang Dynasty (618-907) inherited this poetic form and produced songs in five- and seven-character quatrains. Its structure was more rigorous and regular than long narrative songs. At the same time, the large-scale song and dance form "Daqu," developed by absorbing foreign music in the Tang Dynasty, included a singing section with slow-paced Paibian repeated several times. According to Wang Zhuo's Biji Manzhi, "The Liangzhou Paibian, I once saw a copy with twenty-four sections. Later generations who used Daqu to create lyrics generally simplified it, and the instrumentalists were unwilling to play it from beginning to end." The emergence of this large-scale song form shows that the art of singing had reached a considerable level of development during this period. In the late Tang Dynasty, the so-called "Li Xiang Zhi Qu" (songs of the streets and alleys) emerged. At the same time, some musicians enriched and developed the original tunes during performances, and the original neatly structured five- and seven-character poems could not match the new tunes. Poets had to fill in lyrics according to the new tune formats, and thus the singing form of Ci was produced. By the Song Dynasty (starting in 960), singing Ci became the main form of singing. At the same time, a form more complex than "Daqu" called "Zhugong Diao," which inherited Daqu from the Tang Dynasty and absorbed various musical forms, also developed. It connected tunes of many different palace modes into a set of songs, and many sets of songs formed a complete body. In terms of content, it had relatively complete storylines and many characters, such as Dong Jieyuan's "Romance of the Western Chamber" and the anonymous "Liu Zhiyuan." Therefore, it enabled the art of singing to move from a song and dance form to a stage of expressing storylines and characters. At this time, the form of opera performance mixed with slapstick and competitive games—the Song Zaju—had emerged. At the same time, folk storytelling music such as Changzhuan and Guci also developed significantly.
    At the end of the Northern Song Dynasty, the Jin people occupied the Central Plains, the Song Dynasty perished, and the Mongol nationality came to rule China. Due to the influence of foreign music, new songs appeared among the people. At the same time, because the Mongolian rulers deeply discriminated against the Han people, the status of Han people was very low. Some scholars had to live like ordinary citizens, so they had the opportunity to come into contact with the people's lives, language, and folk literature. Combining new folk tunes, they created a new form of singing art that was easy to understand, lively and intimate in form, reflected people's lives, and was loved and easily accepted by the people. This had a profound impact on the development of our national vocal music art, and this is the Yuan Qu. The performance form of Yuan Qu has two types: Sanqu and opera (Yuan Zaju), especially the latter, which has singing and dialogue, not only expressing character stories but also shaping stage images. At the same time, the Southern Opera (Yongjia Zaju), which was parallel to Yuan Zaju, featured forms such as solo singing, duet singing, round singing (relay singing), and multi-person chorus. This promoted the further development of our national vocal music art from content to form.
    In the Ming Dynasty (starting in 1368), various singing forms such as Yiyang, Haiyan, Yuyao, and Kunshan emerged in the south. Among them, Kunshan Opera made great creations and contributions in singing technology. By the end of the Ming Dynasty, in order to make the performance understandable to the audience, Yiyang Opera added rolling singing and rolling dialogue, with chanting that was close to colloquial language in the singing, simple lyrics, and accompaniment by human voices, making it suitable for performances on high platforms in public squares. Therefore, it was deeply welcomed by the masses and spread widely. When it spread to various places, it could be transformed into various different forms at any time according to the preferences of the masses, which is one of the reasons why modern local operas have such diverse forms. When it flowed into Anhui, it evolved into "Taiping Qiang" and "Siping Qiang," and later formed Huizhou Opera's Erhuang. Another route flowed into Shaanxi and evolved into Qinqiang Bangzi; the later Bangzi operas of Shanxi, Henan, and Hebei all belonged to this system. The Xiangyang Tune of Hubei is said to have been formed by the combination of Qinqiang, which came to Hubei, and the local singing of Hubei, also known as Xipi. It met with the Erhuang Tune of Anhui in Hankou and developed into Han Opera Pi Huang—Han Opera, which flowed into Beijing and developed into today's Peking Opera. The Huqin of Sichuan Opera; the Xiangyang and Huqin of Dian Opera; the North Road and South Road of Xiang Opera and Gui Opera; and the Bangzi and Erwang of Cantonese Opera are all developed by absorbing Pi Huang tunes. Today's Gaoqiang operas of Xiang, Chuan, Gan, Min, and Chaozhou still maintain the performance form of Yiyang Opera, some with the addition of silk and bamboo accompaniment. Under the mutual influence of various large-scale local opera performance forms, various small-scale opera and storytelling forms, which developed from local folk songs and ditties, also emerged like mushrooms after rain. After the May Fourth Movement, European traditional vocal art was introduced into China. The emergence of this new form of singing art added to the splendor of our national vocal music art, making it richer and more colorful.
        (II) Diverse Performing Styles
    The formation of vocal art performance styles is inseparable from factors such as geographical environment, language tones, people's living habits, and emotional expression methods. Since ancient times, the performing styles of our national vocal music art have had certain characteristics. As early as the Warring States period, there was the saying that "Yan and Zhao have many generous and sad singers." The Records of Music of the Book of Song state: "During the decline of the Zhou Dynasty, there was Qin Qing who was good at singing... stroking the beat and singing sadly, his voice shook the trees and stopped the clouds." At this time, the northern singing already had the characteristics of being high-pitched. Regarding southern singing, Xue Jun's annotation in the Book of Later Han says: "The music of the southern barbarians is called Nan. Among the music of the four barbarians, only Nan can harmonize with Ya." Xunzi's Rong Ru says: "Gentlemen are peaceful and elegant." Zhang Taiyan's "Poetry Always Theory" says: "Of the music of the Six Dynasties, Confucius only praised Shao and Wu... Wu had southern tones, and Shao also flowed into the south." Confucius took "peace and moderation" as the criterion, so southern tones must be gentler. During the Six Dynasties, the so-called "Wu Sheng Ge Qu" (Wu-style songs) popular in the Jiangnan area were characterized by their tactful and soft features. After the rise of the Northern and Southern Operas in the Yuan Dynasty, which inherited the development of Tang Dynasty singing art from Song Zaju, the northern and southern performance styles became even more significant. Wei Liangfu's "Qulv" says: "Northern and Southern Operas are greatly different, with Módiao and Xuan Suo Diao styles. Northern Opera has more words and a faster pace, with tendons visible in the pace, so there is more emotional expression of lyrics and less of voice. Southern Opera has fewer words and a slower pace, with eyes visible in the pace, so there is less emotional expression of lyrics and more of voice. The strength of Northern Opera lies in the strings, which are suitable for harmony, so the air is easily rough; the strength of Southern Opera lies in Módiao, which is suitable for solo performance, so the air is easily weak." "Northern Opera focuses on strength; Southern Opera focuses on tact and gentleness, each with its own differences." At the same time, northern music uses the seven-tone scale, while southern music uses the five-tone scale. Therefore, the performance and expression methods are also different. Xu Dachun's "Yuefu Chuansheng" says: "Northern Opera focuses on discontinuity; Southern Opera focuses on continuity... The singing of Southern Opera focuses on continuity; the singing of Northern Opera focuses on discontinuity." Therefore, the emotions expressed by Northern and Southern Operas also give people different feelings. Xu Wenchang's "Nan Ci Xulu" also says: "Listening to Northern Opera makes people feel energetic and courageous, enough to inspire a person's courage... Southern Opera is slow and delicate, flowing and tactful, making people feel ethereal and unconsciously lose their guard." This is the ancients' summary of the performing styles of our national vocal music art, dividing them into two main characteristics of north and south, based on the situation of the past. In fact, it is only limited to the performing styles of the Yellow River Basin and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Although the generalization is not comprehensive enough, the main purpose is to enable performers to understand and easily grasp and express the different performing styles of north and south. Yuan Zhinan's "Chang Lun" has the taboo that "Southerners do not sing Northern Opera, and northerners do not sing." Here, "Qu" refers to Northern Opera, and "Ge" refers to the tactful and slow Southern Opera. It can be seen that since ancient times, we have had high requirements for mastering performing styles.
    Our country is a multi-ethnic country, and each ethnic group's performance has its own unique style. The same is true for the Han nationality, which has different environments such as vast grasslands, steep mountains, boundless plains, and fish and rice villages intertwined with rivers and lakes. The languages and customs are also similar but different. Therefore, not only does the performance vary from province to province, but also the performance of each region within the same province has its own local characteristics. In addition, since the Song Dynasty, due to the more developed urban commercial economy and the increase in population, in order to meet the cultural and entertainment needs of urban citizens and the petty bourgeoisie, places such as "Goulan" and "Washi" (similar to today's Tianqiao) appeared in the cities, which were dedicated to the entertainment of citizens, and the number of folk professional artists increased accordingly. First of all, storytelling music has been greatly developed, and the content of storytelling is mostly historical stories and folk tales. They all have tortuous and complex storylines, as well as various characters that make up the storylines. These characters have different genders, ages, qualities such as loyalty and cunning, personalities such as gentleness and violence, and identities such as scholars, farmers, workers, merchants, emperors, marquises, generals, and ministers. Storytellers are often responsible for performing all of these characters. In order to vividly express these characters through performance, performers have to simulate different timbres during the performance to distinguish them according to the different voices of men, women, old, and young in real life. At the same time, from rich life experiences, observations and understanding of various characters, and the application of sound techniques, it is necessary to create performance methods to portray various musical images of characters. Therefore, the differentiation of various singing methods in national vocal music art and the budding of various performance techniques emerged from folk storytelling. When the art form of opera, which integrates singing, dancing, dialogue, and performance, gradually took shape, because it needed to reflect life through specific character images, various types of roles—Sheng, Dan, Jing, and Chou—needed to have a clear division of labor. Not only did the appearance need to be made up, but also the performer's timbre needed to be differentiated in order to be consistent with the appearance. Due to these requirements, the various singing methods in our national vocal music, which distinguish different types of characters with different timbres, have been developed. Especially during the Jiajing (1522) and Longqing (1567) periods of the Ming Dynasty, Wei Liangfu, who originally studied singing Northern Opera, absorbed the singing methods of the popular Yiyang and Haiyan Operas based on the tunes of the local Kunshan Southern Opera. Through careful research, he integrated the strengths of everyone and created a new vocal style called "Shuimo Diao," which is Kunshan Opera. Its singing method is smooth, gentle, and tactful, and can express emotions more delicately. After the rise of this lyrical vocal style, it had a great influence on stage performance. The singing part on the stage was strengthened, and the role names, the characters portrayed, and the costume performances were more inclined to cooperate with historical stories. Therefore, the requirements for actors to distinguish various types of characters with different timbres and singing methods became higher and higher. Therefore, it absorbed the elements of distinguishing characters by changing different timbres in storytelling, and continuously processed and created them. The singing methods of various types of characters gradually formed. At the same time, the development and progress of industry and commerce in the Ming Dynasty also surpassed any previous dynasty. In addition to a large amount of overseas trade, the domestic commercial market was also very prosperous. At that time, there were many large commercial cities in the country. With the prosperity of the cities, a large number of Jianghu opera troupes and private troupes that met the needs of citizens emerged. Therefore, the number of professional artists increased, and talents emerged in large numbers. In mutual competition and research, the singing technology also improved. Especially in the early Qing Dynasty, it was popular to extract a few wonderful acts from a play to be performed separately, which gave actors more opportunities to create and develop in singing skills. During the Qianlong period, when the Four Great Anhui Troupes arrived in Beijing, all types of roles were complete. At this time, the performance of distinguishing various types of characters with different timbres, singing methods, and expression methods had obviously reached a more mature stage. At the same time, our national opera has another characteristic: for example, the Pi Huang and Bangzi opera types have only twenty or thirty basic Bangua. When actors use these relatively fixed Bangua to express different plays, different characters, different thoughts and feelings, and sing different lyrics, they have to make changes. Therefore, in order to more truly express the thoughts and feelings of different characters, many artists have created and developed the singing and various performance techniques based on their own vocal conditions and on the basis of the basic Bangua. This not only made the opera performance art, which occupies an important position in the national vocal music art, show various singing techniques, develop diverse singing methods and different styles, but also played a great role in enriching the timbre in our vocal music. This makes our national vocal music art more diverse and extremely rich in characteristics. The diverse singing methods and styles with different characteristics are all generated from the life foundations of the masses, and gradually formed through long-term development. Therefore, they all have the characteristics of simplicity, restraint, beauty, accurate and vivid beautification of language, and deep and delicate expression and reflection of people's lives and feelings in our national singing style. For a long time, it has become a form that the masses like to hear and see. It has cultivated our national habits in vocal music appreciation, and also includes our national aesthetic views on singing styles. Therefore, for these different singing methods or national singing arts with different styles, we can only adapt to it and gradually enrich and develop it, but we cannot abandon it or arbitrarily change it. In addition, it is precisely this national style with rich characteristics that distinguishes our singing art from the singing arts of other countries and enriches the treasure house of world vocal music art.
        (III) Expressing Language, Beautifying Language
    The value of vocal art lies in the fact that it directly expresses people's life emotions through clear and beautified language. It has a direct exchange with the listener's inner emotions, which is more touching. In our country, there has long been the saying that "silk is not as good as bamboo, and bamboo is not as good as meat," and sometimes during performances, "the singer is above, and the Paobamboo is below," placing the singer in a more prominent position.
    Beautiful sound, clear language, true feelings, and the skillful use of techniques to organically integrate the three into an artistic whole, which can both express people's complex life emotions and give people a sense of beauty, arousing inner resonance, is the highest requirement of vocal art. Therefore, language has become an important part of vocal art. The Han nationality's language has characteristics different from those of other nationalities; it is a monosyllabic word, with one syllable, one sound, and one meaning. And a syllable contains the factors of consonants, vowels, and compound vowels. In order to distinguish the meanings of monosyllabic words with the same consonant and vowel, each word itself has different tones of high, low, and inflection. These characteristics of the sound, vowel, and tone of the words make our national language produce very natural and rich musicality and beautiful qualities. In the art of singing, through clear and beautified language, which can both express life emotions and express the beautiful qualities of our national language, has become a subject carefully studied by vocal musicians of all dynasties in our country. In this regard, they have made extremely valuable contributions from practice to theory.
    As early as the Later Han Dynasty, due to the translation of Buddhist scriptures, influenced by Indian Sanskrit, they initially came into contact with and understood the functions of certain consonant and vowel letters and fanqie, but its application was limited to monks and had not been mastered by writers. According to the characteristics of our national language, the systematic analysis and research of the sound, vowel, and tone of words became a science, which began with phonology produced in the Northern and Southern Dynasties of the fourth to sixth centuries. Although it was not consciously applied to the art of singing by vocal musicians at that time, it played a great role in the future development of vocal art in our country. Due to the regulations on level and oblique tones and rhyme in Tang Dynasty Jue Lv poetry, the high and low inflections of tones and the changes in the tightness and speed of rhythms produce more regular changes when recited and sung, which sounds more beautiful and harmonious, which is obviously a direct influence of phonology on vocal art. By the Yuan Dynasty, during the Northern and Southern Opera periods, due to the development of opera performance art, in order to more clearly express the language in the performance, the tones of the words were discussed, from adjusting the level and oblique tones to seeking to divide them into four tones, and the four tones were further divided into Yin and Yang. At the same time, China's first rhyme book purely for singing requirements—"Zhongyuan Yinyun"—was written by Zhou Deqing from Gaoan in the Jiazi year of the Yuan Dynasty's Taiding period (1324). It not only enriched the content of Chinese phonology, but also shows that our national vocal music art during this period had already produced a more systematic theory on how to more accurately grasp the characteristics of the national language in performance, and the generation of this theory was based on phonology combined with performance practice. Because the political center was in the north at that time, "Zhongyuan Yinyun" was based on northern language as the standard. In the Ming Dynasty, the political center moved south. In the eighth year of Hongwu (1375), Song Lian from Pujiang, Zhejiang, and Yue Shaofeng from Quanjiao, Anhui, compiled "Hongwu Zhengyun." The difference between them is that there is no entering tone in the north, and the entering tone is assigned to the other three tones. There is an entering tone in the south, so there is the saying of "North to Zhongyuan" and "South to Hongwu" in singing.
    With the rise of Kunshan Opera, in order to express emotions more delicately and highlight the beautiful qualities of language, and to make the singing transmit far, the gentle and tactful, slow and smooth vocal style divided each word into three parts according to the sound and vowel factors: the word head, the word belly, and the word tail. The word head (consonant) part is divided into five parts: throat, tongue, teeth, teeth, and lips, according to the different points of force used during pronunciation, which is called "five sounds." The word belly (vowel), which lengthens the sound, must have a certain mouth shape to regulate it, and is divided into four mouth shapes: open, uniform, closed, and puckered, which is called "four calls." At the end of the word, when a word ends, it is divided into methods of closing the sound such as nasal, apical, closed mouth, straight throat, vocal, spread cheek, and pursed lips, according to the different vowels, and all the vowels of the words are divided into twenty-one rhymes, which are later changed and merged into nineteen rhymes; that is, the so-called nineteen rhymes such as Dongzhong, Jiangyang, Zhisi, Qiwei, Yumo, Jielai, Zhenwen, Hanshan, Huanhuan, Xiantian, Xiaohao, Gege, Jiama, Chezhe, Gengqing, Youhou, Jinxun, Jianxian, and Lianxian.
    By the Qing Dynasty, local opera types such as Pi Huang had lyrics that were closer to spoken language, and the word rhymes that were often used were not as many as Kunqu. At the same time, in order to make it easier for actors to master the sounds and rhymes, the nineteen rhymes were simplified and merged into thirteen rhymes, which are the so-called thirteen rhymes that are commonly used in various local operas and storytelling today, namely: Yisi, Fahua, Mieshe, Renshen, Yanqian, Zhongdong, Jiangyang, Youqiu, Yaotiao, Gusu, Huidui, Huailai, and Suobo. In fact, they are natural rhymes that already existed in folk singing, but there is no such systematic classification. Later, when Pi Huang Opera came to Beijing, although it still maintained the tones of the words in the Hubei and Anhui areas in the performance, many Beijing tones were used for the sounds of the words. Because Jingzi lacked the sharp sounds of wearing teeth, in order to facilitate the distinction of some words with the same sound and rhyme, according to Zhongyuan Yinyun, there was a distinction between "sharp and round words." At the same time, in order to make certain word rhymes easy to pronounce and the sound clear and beautiful when singing, such as singing a part of the words in the Zhisi rhyme with the Qiwei rhyme of Kunqu, there was the so-called "shang kou zi." In short, for thousands of years, national vocal musicians have been constantly researching and creating from practice on how to grasp the characteristics of the sound, rhyme, and tone of words in performance, in order to make the pronunciation clear, the sound beautiful, and the transmission far when singing, and to more accurately express the beautiful qualities of the national language and more delicately express life emotions. Therefore, vocal musicians of all dynasties have made strict demands on clear pronunciation during performance; Zhang Yan's "Ci Yuan" in the Song Dynasty states: "The cavity is flat and the word is oblique, do not hesitate, you must first say the word and then the cavity." Wei Liangfu's "Qulv" in the Ming Dynasty states: "There are three perfections in music: clear words are one perfection." Li Yu's "Xianqing Ouji" in the Qing Dynasty also states: "People who learn to sing, regardless of skill, only look at whether they have a mouth or not. People who listen to music, slowly talk about refinement, first ask whether there are words or not. Words come out of the mouth, there are words and there is a mouth. If the exit is not clear, there are words as if there are no words, it is speaking with a mouth, but singing without a mouth, what is the difference from a mute?" Therefore, folk artists learn to sing, first starting with recitations, and only when the words are accurately recited can they sing. And today's opera and storytelling actors all know that during the performance, "the four tones cannot be divided, and the level and oblique tones cannot be adjusted," and "if the rhyme does not match, it is unbearable to listen to." And this is an important standard for judging the quality of the performance. The reason why the performances of many excellent national singers can be touching and moving is precisely because they have accurately grasped the beautiful qualities of our national language, used skilled techniques, and expressed life emotions deeply and delicately with clear, beautiful, and vivid language.
    So, in traditional singing, is it only paying attention to the words and not seeking the beauty of vocal music? No, the so-called "round and jade-like," "soaring into the sky," "grand bell and big tripod, sound like a bell," etc. are all descriptions of the beauty of sound. In Yuan Yan Nan Zhi An's "Chang Lun," about the sound part, it says: "There are singing sound diseases; scattered, burnt, dry, bleak, dumb, unclear, sharp, low, female, male, short, foolish, turbid, out of control..." It points out various bad sounds very specifically, which relatively shows that there are strict requirements for sound beauty in tradition. In tradition, some believe that the best sound must have five characteristics: sweet, crisp, round, moist, and water (clear like water). Storytelling performances require "moving sounds and rhymes, and intoxicating sounds." However, tradition does not talk about sound beauty in isolation. The beautiful sound must be able to express life emotions through clear language to be truly beautiful. Otherwise, as Wang Dehui and Xu Yuancheng's "Gu Wu Lu" in the Qing Dynasty said: "There is sound but no words... although it has a lingering sound, it will eventually become a laughing stock." The so-called "true words and round cavity" in tradition precisely explains the mutual organic relationship between words and sound beauty, that is, the position of the throat, tongue, teeth, lips, and teeth of the word sound is correct, and the mouth shapes of opening, uniformity, closing, and puckering are accurate, then the emitted sound can meet the content requirements of the word, and it will be good to hear. Similarly, a good-sounding vocal style must be the continuation and connection of correct word sounds.
    Therefore, the systematic summary and elucidation of the characteristics of grasping and expressing the beauty of national language in performance has become a very important and rich content of our traditional vocal music theory, and it is also a national vocal music aesthetic with considerable scientific level. It is not only the vocal music theory knowledge that vocal musicians in our country must study, but also a very valuable contribution to the world's vocal music art.
              (IV) The Use of Breath
    A beautiful vocal style needs to be supported by breath. In tradition, the use of breath has always been considered the key to determining singing. Duan Anjie's "Yuefu Zalu" in the Tang Dynasty states: "A good singer must first adjust his breath, which emanates from the umbilicus, and then breathe out the lyrics to distinguish the sounds of rising and falling. Once he obtains the technique, he can achieve the wonderful effect of stopping the clouds and echoing the valley." This shows that 1,000 years ago, vocal musicians in our country had already summarized the experience of singers correctly using breath. Zhang Yan's "Ci Yuan" in the Song Dynasty has a deeper understanding of the use of breath, such as: "Take a breath in a busy time without being chaotic, stop the voice and wait for the beat without breaking, take a big breath in a good place and linger, be restrained and enter less breath to change." This is probably a valuable experience in using breath that any good singer must absorb. Yuan Yan Nan Zhi An's "Chang Lun" has various methods of using breath such as "stealing breath, taking breath, changing breath, resting breath, taking advantage of breath, and loving one breath." Chen Yizheng in modern times said Tan Zhongyou: "Breath is the commander of sound. If the breath is rough, the sound is floating; if the breath is weak, the sound is thin; if the breath is turbid, the sound is stagnant; if the breath is scattered, the sound is exhausted." Therefore, in opera actors, it is invariably required that they use the breath of the "Dantian" when performing, and it is also said that the "Zhong Qi" is sufficient, and the sound can be loud and powerful. The so-called "Dantian" and "Zhong Qi" here are terms used in the national traditional vocal music that require the diaphragm to control breathing during performance. The traditional use of breath emphasizes having more than enough and not making people feel exhausted, and at the same time, it requires saving and using as much as needed. Especially in terms of changing breath, it is more particular. In tradition, it is called "Qi Kou," which is not only for dividing sections and sentences, but also for making the audience not notice the action when changing breath, so as not to affect the artistic integrity of emotional expression. Therefore, all famous performers have put a lot of effort into this, carefully pondering how to make various arrangements for changing breath between a certain word or a word according to the needs of emotional expression. Zhi An Chang Lun's "stealing breath, taking breath, changing breath, resting breath, taking advantage of breath..." are also the skillful use of various breath changing techniques. It not only makes the audience not feel it, but also enhances the expressiveness of the art. This can be said to be a special creation in our national vocal music art for the use of breath, and it is also a very valuable experience.
        (V) Experience in Vocal Music Teaching
    When the art of vocal music is still in the nature of folk amateurism, it is impossible to have more formal teaching methods. Only after entering professionalization can it be gradually formed from continuous accumulation in practice. According to the development of vocal music art in our country, the stage where the art of singing entered professionalization should be said to have started from the establishment of the institution that "made sound and measured music"—"Yuefu" by Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. "Yuefu" is not only an institution for collecting, sorting, adapting, and creating folk songs, but also a large-scale professional song and dance troupe. During the reign of Emperor Ai of the Han Dynasty, due to the large number of personnel in "Yuefu" and large expenses, the number was reduced from 829 to 388. It can be said to be the first large-scale national song and dance troupe in our country's history. The "Liyuan" in the Tang Dynasty was also a professional song and dance troupe. The "Tang Shu Li Yue Zhi" said: "Emperor Xuanzong was familiar with rhythm and loved Faqu very much, so he selected 300 disciples from the Zuo Bu Ji and taught them in Liyuan. If there was any error in the sound, the emperor would definitely notice and correct it. He was called the disciple of the Liyuan of the emperor. Hundreds of palace maids were also disciples of Liyuan." Later, similar institutions to "Liyuan" were established in the palaces of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. The scale of the "Shengping Department" in the late Qing Dynasty was also not small. At the same time, since the Song Dynasty, the number of folk professional opera troupes has also increased. These are institutions that train and perform at the same time. As for how to train, there are very few written records. However, from Xuanzong's "selecting 300 disciples from the Zuo Bu Ji and teaching them in Liyuan," it can be seen that there was a selection of the objects being trained, and "the emperor would definitely notice and correct any errors in the sound" shows that there was teaching. Judging from the teaching situation of the Fu Liancheng Ke Ban founded by the people at the end of the Qing Dynasty and some experienced old artists, a lot of valuable experience has been accumulated in traditional teaching, which can be summarized into the following basic principles: First, teaching students according to their aptitude: for example, dividing the lines according to the different vocal conditions of the students. When the technology has laid a certain foundation, let the students give play to their creativity according to their own conditions. The same teacher can teach several students with different performance styles or characteristics. As everyone knows, the four famous Dan of Peking Opera have all consulted Wang Yaoqing, but their performances have their own characteristics and are not all like Wang Yaoqing. Second, step by step: In terms of technical training materials, according to the steps from shallow to deep and from simple to complex, such as practicing Bai, starting with the introduction and the opening poem, and then gradually entering the large paragraphs of Bai. Singing is also the same, first learn a section, and then gradually enter the main play, what to sing when opening the door, and then what to learn, there are also certain regulations. Third, combining technical training with stage practice: In the past, learning to sing opera was mainly for eating, so in order to be able to perform on stage after graduation, students were often allowed to participate in performances during the learning process. There may not be many plays, but the main thing is to train students to be familiar with the stage and the audience. Fourth, teachers care for and train students comprehensively from technology to body and mind; in addition to technology, such as the students' diet, warmth, psychological health, and warning students with achievements against complacency, etc., they always pay attention to and educate them. Fifth, combining voice protection and exercise: In order to protect the voice in tradition, not only is it forbidden to eat certain foods that are harmful to the voice, but also the role of cultivating oneself and maintaining physical and mental health is emphasized, and exercise is also emphasized. Therefore, from the beginning of learning, in order to exercise the ability to adapt to harsh natural conditions, there is the so-called "winter practice in the dog days and summer practice in the dog days," that is, the colder and hotter the weather, the more students must persist in training, which is naturally because in the past, there were very few indoor theaters, and most of them were open-air stages. Whether it was winter or summer, even in snowy days and scorching heat, they had to perform, so they had to exercise in these harsh natural conditions. Although the situation has changed today, the spirit of perseverance and hard work of a singer in order to overcome harsh natural conditions is still needed. Although traditional teaching had no formal schools in the past, it was mainly apprentices taught by masters. At the same time, these experiences are not necessarily concentrated on one teacher, and not all teachers have them. Even if there are teachers with these experiences, they may not be able

    继承与发扬民族声乐艺术传统
    舒模
        （一）历史悠久的声乐艺术
    一切民族的声乐艺术，最初都是起源于从人民生活与劳动过程中所产生的民歌。我们是个具有几千年历史文化的国家，从我们的祖先起，就是一个很爱歌唱与舞蹈的民族。古书上早就记载着：“男女有所怨恨，相从而歌。饥者歌其食，劳者歌其事。”（公羊传宣公十五年何休注）而“咏歌之不足，不知手之舞之，足之蹈之也”（诗大序）。几千年来，我们的祖先创作了非常丰富的多种形式的民歌。
    诗经、楚辞、乐府、唐诗、宋词、元曲等都是过去各个时代歌唱的主要艺术形式，它们也都是从民歌的土壤中生长起来的。由于宋以前的乐谱大部分没有留传下来，留下的只有文学部分。其中有的是原来民间的人民口头创作，更多是诗人模仿民歌形式经过加工的艺术作品。诗经，是孔子（纪元前551—479）从古代留传下来的三千多首民歌中选编的一部民歌集，史记孔子世家有：“古者，诗三千余篇，及至孔子，去其重，取可施于礼义，……三百五篇，孔子皆弦歌之，以求合韶、武、雅、颂之音，礼、乐自此可得而述，以备王道，成六艺。”楚辞是二千年前伟大的诗人屈原吸取楚国民歌的营养，加工创作的艺术诗歌。王逸九歌章句序说：“昔楚国南郢之邑，沅湘之间，其俗信鬼而好祠，其祠必作歌乐鼓舞，以乐诸神”。九歌里的“湘君”、“河伯”、“山鬼”等都是神的名字，所以九歌也就是祭神的歌唱。乐府形成于汉初。汉武帝（纪元前140）“立乐府，采诗夜诵，有赵代秦楚之讴，以李延年为协律都尉，多举司马相如等数十人造为诗赋，略论律吕，以合八音之调，作十九章之歌”（汉书礼乐志）。而乐府诗歌，到了南北朝（386—589）时期，衍变为具有丰富人民性的长篇五、七言叙事歌唱，如“孔雀东南飞”，“木兰辞”等，就是这种歌唱形式的代表作。唐代（618—907）也就是继承了这种诗歌形式产生了五、七言绝律诗的歌唱。它的体式结构较长篇叙事歌唱更严谨而有规律。同时唐代由于吸收外族音乐而发展的大型歌舞形式——“大曲”，其中歌唱部分有慢板之排遍若干遍。据王灼碧鸡漫志云“凉州排遍，予曾见一本，有二十四段。后世就大曲制词者，类从简省；而管弦家又不肯从首至尾吹弹。”这种大型歌唱形式的出现，说明歌唱艺术在这个时期已有相当高的发展。到了晚唐，民间有所谓“里巷之曲”产生了，同时一些乐工在演唱中，将原有曲调加以丰富发展，而原来句法整齐的五、七言诗与新的曲调配合不上，诗人们就不得不按新的曲调格式来填词，于是词的歌唱体式就产生了。到了宋代（960起），唱词就成为主要的歌唱形式了。同时继承唐代大曲并吸收多种乐曲形式而发展的一种比“大曲”结构更复杂的“诸宫调”也产生了。它以很多不同宫调的曲子连成为一套唱曲，再以许多套唱曲组成为一个正体。在内容方面，它有较完整的故事情节与众多人物出现，如董解元的“西厢记”、无名氏的“刘智远”等，因此，它使歌唱艺术，从歌舞形式，进入表现故事情节与人物的阶段了。这时与滑稽戏及竞技游戏混合在一起的戏曲演唱形式——宋杂剧已出现了。同时唱赚、鼓词等民间说唱音乐，也有了较大的发展。
    北宋末年，金人已占据中原，宋亡，蒙古民族又来统治中国。由于外族音乐的影响，民间又有了新的歌唱出现。同时，又由于蒙古统治者对汉族歧视很深，汉人地位很低下，一些读书人，这时就不得不与一般市民一样的生活了，因此也就有了接触人民生活、语言以及民间文学的机会，于是结合民间新的曲调，就产生了内容通俗易懂，形式生动亲切，反映人民生活并为人民所喜爱、易于接受的一种新的歌唱艺术形式，这就是对我们民族声乐艺术发展深有影响的元曲。元曲的演唱形式有两种：一是散曲、一是戏曲（元杂剧），尤以后者，有唱、有白，不仅表现人物故事，还要塑造舞台形象。同时与元杂剧并立的南戏（永嘉杂剧），更出现独唱、对唱、轮唱（接唱）及多人合唱等形式，这促使我们民族声乐艺术，从内容到形式又获得进一步的发展。
    到了明代（1368起），南方各地产生了弋阳、海盐、余姚、昆山等腔的演唱形式，其中昆山腔在演唱技术上是有很大的创造与贡献。弋阳腔，到了明代末叶，为了演唱能使听众易懂，加了滚唱滚白，唱腔中夹有近乎口语化的诵唱，唱词通俗，又有人声帮和，适宜广场高台演出，因此深得群众欢迎，流传地区很广。它流传到各地方，更能随时随地结合群众的爱好而衍变成种种不同的形式，这乃是使近代地方戏曲有多种多样形式出现的原因之一。它流入安徽，衍变成为“太平腔”、“四平腔”，后来又形成徽调二黄。另一路流入陕西，就衍变为秦腔梆子；后来的山西、河南、河北等梆子都属于这一系统。湖北的襄阳调，据说乃是秦腔到了湖北，与湖北地方歌唱结合衍变而形成的，又名西皮。它与安徽的二黄调在汉口会合，发展成为汉调皮黄——汉剧，汉调皮黄，流入北京发展为今天的京剧。川剧的胡琴；滇剧的襄阳、胡琴；湘剧、桂剧的北路、南路以及粤剧的梆子、二王等，都是吸收皮黄调而发展的。而今天的湘、川、赣、闽、潮州等剧种的高腔，都仍保持弋阳腔的演唱形式，有的则加了丝竹伴奏。在各种大型地方戏曲演唱形式相互影响下，从地方山歌、小曲等基础发展的各种小型戏曲、说唱形式，也如雨后春笋般地产生了。五四以后，欧洲传统声乐艺术又传入中国，这种新的歌唱艺术形式的出现，使得我们民族声乐艺术内容，锦上添花，更为丰富而多采。
        （二）多种多样的演唱风格
    声乐艺术演唱风格的形成，是与地理环境、语言声调、人民生活习惯以及感情表现方法等因素分不开的。我们民族声乐艺术的演唱风格，自古以来就具有一定的特点。远在战国时代即有“燕赵多慷慨悲歌之士”的说法，宋书乐志载：“周衰有秦青者善讴，……抚节悲歌，声震林木，响遏行云。”这时北方歌唱已具有高亢的特点了。南方的歌唱，后汉书注薛君章句说：“南夷之乐曰南，四夷之乐，唯南可以和于雅者。”荀子荣辱篇有“君子安雅”；章太炎诗始终论说：六代之乐，孔子独美韶、武，……武有南音，韶亦流入于南故也。”孔子是以“平和中庸”为准则的，故南音一定是较温和的。六朝时，江浙一带民间的所谓“吴声歌曲”，就是以宛转柔和的特色而风行一时。到了元代继承唐代歌唱艺术发展的宋杂剧，由于与北方“里巷之曲”结合形成的北曲及与南方山歌小曲结合而形成的南曲兴起以后，南北演唱风格就更其显著了。魏良辅曲律有：“北曲与南曲大相悬绝，有磨调弦索调之分，北曲字多而调促，促处见筋，故词情多而声情少；南曲字少而调缓，缓处见眼，故词情少而声情多。北力在弦索，宜和歌，故气易粗；南力在磨调，宜独奏，故气易弱。”“北曲以遒劲主；南曲以宛转为主，各有不同。”同时北方乐曲用的是七声音阶，南方则用的是五声音阶。因此演唱及表现方法也各异。徐大椿乐府传声说：“北曲主断；南曲主连。……南曲之唱，以连为主；北曲之唱，以断为主”，所以南北曲所表达的情绪，也使人产生不同的感觉。徐文长南词叙录也说：“听北曲使人神气鹰扬，毛发酒淅，足以作人勇往之志。……南曲则纡徐绵缈，流丽宛转，使人飘飘然丧其所守而不自觉。”这是古人根据过去时代的情况将我们民族声乐艺术演唱风格概括分为南北两个主要的特点，实际也仅限于黄河流域与长江中下游一带的演唱风格。虽然概括不够全面，主要的还是为了使演唱者能够理解并便于掌握与表现南北不同的演唱风格。元，芝庵唱论有：“南人不曲，北人不歌”的忌条。这里的曲，是指的北曲，歌则是南方的宛转曼声的南曲。可见自古以来，我们对演唱风格的掌握要求很高。
    我国是一个多民族的国家，每个民族的演唱都有它自己的独特风格。同样是汉族，还有：辽阔的草原、峻峭的山地、无际的平川及河湖交织的鱼米之乡等等不同的环境，语言、风俗习惯也大同小异，因此不仅省与省的演唱有所不同，同一个省内的各地区的演唱，也各具地方特色。加之自宋代起，由于城市商业经济比以前更加发达，人口增多，为了适应市民及小市民阶层文化娱乐的需要，城市中就出现勾栏、瓦市（类似现在的天桥）一类的专供市民娱乐的场所，民间职业艺人随之增多。首先说唱音乐，得到很大的发展，而说唱的内容，大多是历史故事与民间传说。它们都有曲折而复杂的故事情节，以及构成故事情节的各色各样的人物，这些人物的性别有男女，年龄有老少，品质有忠诚奸猾，性格有温柔刚暴，身份有士农工商、君侯将相等等之不同，说唱者，又多由一人担任。为了通过演唱将这些人物表现得形象而生动，演唱者就不得不根据现实生活中男女老少声音的不同，演唱时模拟不同的音色来加以区分，同时从丰富的生活经验中，对各种人物的观察体会，在声音技巧的运用上也需要创造刻划各种人物音乐形象的表现方法，于是民族声乐艺术中各种唱法的区分以及多种多样的表现技巧创造的萌芽，从民间说唱中显露出来。当以歌、舞、白、表演溶和于一炉的戏曲艺术形式逐渐形成后，由于它须要通过具体的人物形象来反映生活，因此各种类型的角色——生、旦、净、丑需要有明确的分工，不仅外形需要化装，演唱者的音色为了与外形统一，也要有所区别，由于这样的要求，就促使在我们民族声乐中，以不同音色来区分不同类型人物的各种演唱方法得到发展。尤其到了明代嘉靖（1522）隆庆（1567）间，原来学唱北曲的魏良辅，以昆山地方唱南戏的声调为基础，吸取当时流行的弋阳腔与海盐腔的唱法，精心钻研，融汇众之所长，创造一种新的声腔名“水磨调”也就是昆山腔。它的唱法流丽清柔而宛转，能够更细致地表达感情。这种具有抒情性的声腔兴起后，对舞台演唱起了很大影响，舞台上唱的部分更加强了，同时角色名目，所饰人物及服装表演等也更倾向于与历史故事的配合，因此对演员以不同音色、唱法来区分各种类型人物的要求越来越高，于是吸取说唱中以不同音色变化来区分人物的因素，不断加工创造，各种类型人物的唱法就逐渐形成了。同时，明代的工商业发达与进步，也超越过去任何一个朝代，除对海外的大量贸易外，国内的商业市场也很繁荣，当时国内已有不少大商业都市，随着都市的繁荣，就有大量的适应市民需要的江湖戏班及私家班社产生，因此职业艺人增多，人才辈出，在相互竞争钻研中，演唱技术也随着提高。尤其到了清初，盛行将一出戏中精彩的几折抽出单独演唱，这样就给演员在演唱技巧上有更多创造与发展的机会。在乾隆年间，四大徽班到北京时，各门角色都已齐全，这时以不同的音色、唱法与表现方法来区分各种类型人物的演唱，显然早已达到较成熟的阶段了。同时我们民族戏曲还有个特点；如皮黄、梆子剧种只有二三十个基本板腔，演员要运用这些较固定的板腔来表现不同的戏，不同的人物，不同的思想感情及演唱不同的唱词时，就不能不有所变化，因此很多艺人为了更真实地表达不同人物的思想感情，就根据自己声音条件，在基本板腔的基础上，对唱腔及各种表现技巧进行创造与发挥，这样不仅使在民族声乐艺术中占着重要地位的戏曲演唱艺术，出现了多种演唱技巧，发展了多样的唱法与不同的风格，对丰富我们声乐中声音色采起了很大作用。由此使得我们民族声乐艺术更具有多种多样极为丰富的特点。而多种多样不同特点的唱法与风格，又都是从广大群众生活基础上产生，经过长期的发展逐渐形成的，因此它们又都具有我们民族歌唱风格中的朴质、含蓄、优美以及准确而生动的美化语言，深刻而细腻地表达与反映人民生活感情等特点。长时期来，已成为群众所喜闻乐见的形式了。它培养了我们对声乐欣赏上的民族习惯，也包涵了我们对演唱风格的民族审美观点。所以对于这些不同唱法或不同风格的民族演唱艺术，我们只能适应它并逐渐地丰富它与发展它，而不能脱离它或武断地改变它。此外，也正是这种具有丰富特点的民族风格，使我们的歌唱艺术区别于其他各国歌唱艺术，并丰富了世界声乐艺术的宝库。
        （三）表现语言，美化语言
    声乐艺术之可贵，在于它是直接通过清晰而美化的语言来表达人们生活情感的。它与听者的内在情感发生直接的交流，感人更深。我国古代即有“丝不如竹，竹不如肉”的说法，有时在表演时，是“歌者在上，匏竹在下”。将歌唱者置于较突出的地位。
    美的声音、清晰的语言、真实的感情，以及运用熟练的技巧将三者有机地融和为一个艺术整体，既能表达人们复杂的生活感情，又能给人以美的感受，引起内心的共鸣，这是声乐艺术最高的要求。因此语言就成为声乐艺术重要的组成部分了。汉民族的语言具有与其它民族不同的特点；是单音节的字，一字一音一义。而一个字音又包含着声母、韵母与复合韵母组成的因素。为了区别同声韵的单音字意，每个字本身又有高低抑扬不同的声调。这种字的声、韵、调的特点，就使得我们民族语言产生了非常自然而丰富的音乐性与美的特质。而在歌唱艺术中，透过清晰而美化的语言，既能表达生活情感，又能将我们民族语言的美的特质表现出来，就成为我国历代声乐家们所精心钻研的课题了。在这方面他们从实践到理论做出了极有价值的贡献。
    远在后汉时，由于翻译佛经，受了印度梵文的影响，初步接触与了解到一定声韵字母及反切等作用，但是它的应用还只限于僧侣，尚未被文学家所掌握。根据我们民族语言的特点，将字的声、韵、调进行较有系统的分析与研究成为一门科学，还是从四——六世纪南北朝代所产生的音韵学开始，虽然当时还未被声乐家有意识的应用到歌唱艺术中来，但它对以后我国声乐艺术的发展是起了很大作用。唐代绝律诗由于有了平仄、协韵的规定，诵唱起来，声调的高低抑扬，节奏的紧弛快慢，产生较有规律的变化，听起来给人更为优美而协调的感觉，这显然是音韵学对声乐艺术所起的直接影响。到了元代，南北曲时期，由于戏曲演唱艺术有了发展，为了演唱中能更清晰的表现语言，于是在字的声调上，从调平仄，进而讲求分四声，四声中又有阴阳之分。同时我国第一部纯粹为歌唱要求的韵谱——“中原音韵”，由高安人周德清于元泰定甲子（1324）写成了。它不仅丰富了我国音韵学的内容。同时也说明我们民族声乐艺术在这个时期，对于在演唱中如何更准确掌握民族语言的特点，已经产生了较有系统的理论了，而这种理论的产生，是在音韵学的基础上结合了演唱实践而来的。由于当时政治中心在北方，“中原音韵”是以北方语言为标准的。到了明代，政治中心南移，于洪武八年（1375）由浙江浦江宋濂，安徽全椒乐韶凤等编撰“洪武正韵”。它们不同之处是北方无入声，入声派入其他三声中，南方有入声，于是唱曲的就有“北向中原”与“南宗洪武”之说了。
    昆山腔兴起，由于这种清柔宛转、缓慢而流丽的声腔，为了能更细致地来表达感情以及突出语言美的特质，同时使歌声还能传送的远，于是根据字的声、韵因素，将每个字分为字头、字腹、字尾三部分，字头（子音）部分根据发音时所用的着力点不同，又分为喉、舌、齿、牙、唇五个部位，谓之“五音”。而引长声响的字腹（母音），必须有一定的口形来规范着，就归分为开、齐、合、撮四种口形，所谓“四呼”，在字尾，也即一字结尾时，又根据韵母的不同，分为穿鼻、抵颚、闭口、直喉、从声、展辅、敛唇等收声之法，并将所有字的韵母，归分二十一韵，后改并为十九韵；也即东中、江阳、支思、齐微、鱼模、皆来、真文、寒山、桓欢、先天、肖豪、歌戈、家麻、车遮、庚青、尤侯、浸寻、监咸、廉纤等所谓十九韵。
    到了清代，皮黄等地方剧种，由于唱词更接近口语，经常用到的字韵不像昆曲那样多，同时又为了让演员更便于掌握声韵，将十九韵简并而为十三韵，也就是今天各地方戏曲与说唱较普遍采用的所谓十三辙，即：衣斯、发花、乜斜、人沉、言前、中东、江阳、由求、摇条、姑苏、灰堆、怀来、梭波等。实际也就是原来即存在于民间演唱中的自然韵辙，不过没有这样系统的分类。后来皮黄剧到了北京，演唱中虽然仍保持湖北安徽一带字的声调，字音则采用了不少北京音，由于京字少穿齿的尖音，为了有些同声韵的字便于分清，依照中原音韵，就有了“尖团字”之分，同时又为了使某些字韵唱起来，音易发而声清美，如将支思韵中一部分字，以昆曲的齐微韵来唱，于是又有了所谓“上口字”出现。总之千百年来，民族声乐家们，对于在演唱中如何掌握字的声、韵、调的特点，从实践中进行不断地研求与创造，无非是为了演唱时的吐字清晰，声音好听，传送得远，能够更准确地表现民族语言美的特质，更细致地表达生活情感。因此，历代声乐家对演唱时吐字清晰，无不提出严格要求；宋代张炎词源中即有：“腔平字侧莫参商，先须道字后还腔。”明代魏良辅曲律有：“曲有三绝：字清为一绝”。清代李笠翁的闲情偶寄也有：“学唱之人，勿论巧拙，只看有口无口。听曲之人，慢讲精粗，先问有字无字。字从口出，有字即有口。如出口不分明，有字若无字，是说话有口，唱曲无口，与哑人何异哉。”所以民间艺人学唱，首先是从念白入手，字念准了才能唱。而今天的戏曲与说唱的演员，谁都知道演唱时，“四声不可不分，平仄不可不调”，“辙韵不合，则不堪入耳”。并以此为评定演唱好坏的重要标准。很多优秀的民族歌唱家的演唱之所以能够动人心弦，感人肺腑，正是由于他们准确地掌握了我们民族语言美的特质，运用熟炼的技巧，以清晰优美而生动的语言，深刻而细致地表达了生活情感。
    如此说来，传统演唱中，是否只注意字而不讲求声乐的美呢？不是，所谓“珠圆玉润”、“响彻云霄”、“黄钟大吕、声若洪钟”等都是声音美的形容。在元人燕南芝庵唱论中，关于声音部分说：“有唱声病；散散、焦焦、干干、冽冽、哑哑、??、尖尖、低低、雌雌、雄雄、短短、憨憨、浊浊、赸赸，……”非常具体地将各种不好的声音指出，相对的说明在传统中，对声音美是有严格要求的。传统中，有的认为最好的声音须具备甜、脆、圆、润、水（清彻如水）等五个特点，曲艺演唱中要求有
  “动人的声韵、醉人的音。”但是传统中不是孤立讲声音美，美的声音要能透过清晰的语言表达了生活情感，才是真正具有艺术价值的美。否则如清代王德晖、徐沅澄的顾误录所说：“有声无辞……虽具绕梁，终成笑柄。”传统中所谓“字真腔圆”，正说明字与声音美的相互有机关系，也即字音的喉舌齿牙唇的部位正，开齐合撮的口形准，那发出的声音就能符合字的内容要求，也就好听，同样，好听的声腔，一定是正确字音的延续与相连。
    因此，较有系统地总结与阐明演唱中掌握与表现民族语言美的特质，成为我们传统声乐理论极重要而丰富的内容，也是具有相当科学水平的民族声乐美学。它不仅是我国声乐家必须研究的声乐理论知识，同时，也是对世界声乐艺术极有价值的贡献。
              （四）气息的运用
    美好的声腔，须要以气息来支持，传统中对于气息的运用，一向被认为是决定歌唱的重要关键。唐段安节乐府杂录中即有：“善歌者，必先调其气，氤氲自脐间出，至喉乃噫其词，即分抗坠之音，既得其术，即可致遏云响谷之妙也。”说明一千年前，我国声乐家即已将歌唱者正确运用呼吸的经验总结出来。而宋张炎词源关于气息的运用则有更深的体会，如：“忙中取气急不乱，停声待拍慢不断，好处大取气流连，拘则少入气转换。”这恐怕是任何一个善歌者都必须吸取的运用气息的宝贵的经验。元燕南芝庵唱论则“有偷气、取气、换气、歇气、就气、爱者有一口气”等各种用气方法。近人陈彦衡说谭中有：“夫气者音之帅也，气粗则音浮，气弱则音薄，气浊则音滞，气散则音竭。”所以在戏曲演员中，无不讲求演唱时要使用“丹田”之气，也有“衷气”足，声音才能洪亮有力之说。这里所谓“丹田”、“衷气”，就是演唱时要求以横膈膜控制呼吸的民族传统声乐中的用语。而传统对于气息运用，讲究要绰绰有余，不使人有力竭之感，同时又要求节省，用多少使多少。尤其在换气方面，更为考究。传统中名为“气口”。这不仅是为了分节断句，并且在换气时要不使观众察觉动作，以免影响对感情表现的艺术完整性。因此名演唱家无不在这方面下很大的功夫，精心琢磨，如何随着感情表现的需要，在某一词或一字之间进行各种换气的安排。芝庵唱论所说的“偷气、取气、换气、歇气、就气……”等，也即各种换气技术的巧妙运用，它不但使观众不感觉，反由此而更增强了艺术的表现力。这可以说是我们民族声乐艺术中，对气息运用的特殊创造，也是非常宝贵的经验。
        （五）声乐教学的经验
    声乐教学，当歌唱艺术还处于民间业余性质时，不可能有较正规的教学方法产生，只有进入专业化后，才可能从实践中不断积累而逐渐形成。根据我国声乐艺术发展情况，歌唱艺术进入专业化的阶段，应该说是从汉武帝设立“制音度曲”的机构——“乐府”开始。“乐府”不仅是个收集、整理、改编与创作民歌的机构，同时还是规模庞大的专业歌舞团体。汉哀帝时，由于“乐府”人员多，开支大，曾从八百二十九人，减到三百八十八人。可以说是我国历史上第一个大规模的国家歌舞团。唐代的“梨园”，也是专业性的歌舞团体。唐书礼乐志说：“玄宗既知音律，又酷爱法曲，选坐部伎子弟三百，教于梨园，声有误者，帝必觉而正之，号皇帝梨园弟子。宫女数百，亦为梨园弟子。”以后宋、元、明、清的宫庭里都有类似“梨园”的机构设立，晚清的“升平署”规模也不小。同时自宋代起，民间职业戏班也增多了，这些都是一面训练，一面演出的机构。至于如何训练，文字记载的很少。不过从玄宗“选坐部伎子弟三百，教于梨园”，可以看出，对被培养的对象，是有所选择的，而“声有误者，帝必觉而正之”说明有了教学。根据清末民间创办的富连成科班以及一些富有经验的老艺人的教学情况来看，在传统教学中，积累了不少可贵的经验，可归纳出以下几个基本原则：第一，因材施教：如根据学生不同的声音条件分行，当技术打下一定基础后，即让学生根据自己的条件发挥独创性，同一个老师可以教出几个不同演唱风格或特点的学生。大家都知道的，京剧的四大名旦，都曾请教过王瑶卿，但是他们的演唱各具特点，并不都像王瑶卿。第二，循序渐进：在技术训练的教材方面，按照由浅入深，由简到繁步骤，如练白，先由引子及上场诗开始，然后渐进入大段道白。练唱也是，先学一段，逐渐进入正出，开门唱什么，然后又学什么，也有一定的规定。第三，技术锻炼与舞台实践相结合：过去学唱戏，主要是为了吃饭，所以为了学成后出科就能登台演唱，因此在学习过程中经常让学生参加演出，戏不一定很多，主要锻炼学生对舞台及观众的熟悉。第四，老师对学生从技术到身心，全面地关心与培养；除了技术外，如对学生的饮食、寒暖、心理健康以及有成绩的学生警惕自满等等，无不经常注意与教育。第五，声音的保护与锻炼相结合：传统中为了对嗓音的保护，不仅忌吃某些对嗓音有损害的食物，并强调修身养性，身心健康的作用，同时也强调锻炼。因此，学生从开始学习起，为了锻炼能够对恶劣的自然条件的适应，有所谓“冬练三九，热练三伏”，也就是在越冷与越热的天气，越要让学生坚持炼习，这固然是由于过去时代很少室内剧场，多为露天舞台，无论冬夏，甚至风雪天、酷暑中都得演唱，就必须要经常在这种恶劣自然条件中进行锻炼。今天情况虽然有所改变，但是，一个歌唱家为了要克服恶劣自然条件的坚毅苦练的精神，还是需要的。虽然传统教学过去并无正规学校，主要是师傅带徒弟，同时这些经验，不一定集中在一个老师身上，也不一定所有的老师都具有，即使有这些经验的老师也不一定能说出一套教学原理和法则来，但是这些原则如果根据现代的教学原理来总结印证，的确存在于我们传统教学中，而今天很多名演员，就是从这些教学方法中培养起来的，是值得我们加以发扬的。
        （六）继往开来的艰巨工作
    我们民族的声乐艺术，具有深厚而悠久的传统。今天仅以各种地方戏曲及说唱的不完全的统计，将近有三百种之多。形式如此丰富多采而又为人民所喜闻乐见，内容反映了人民生活，并与人民思想感情紧密相连。它是我们祖先几千年来，从生活斗争中，经过不断地辛勤创造，以及历代名家积累起来的艺术劳动成果。它像长江大河一样，从遥远的古代，经过一条漫长而又曲折的途程，一直延流到今天。几千年来，它灌溉与肥沃无垠的生活土地，滋长了不可以数计的精神食粮，充实与丰富了人们的生活内容，鼓舞了人们为自己美好的生活理想而斗争的乐观情绪与坚强信念。
    可是对于这样悠久的民族声乐艺术传统、丰富多采的内容形式，一直没有进行过很好的研究与整理，宝贵的演唱与教学经验以及虽然还不够全面，但已具有一定科学水平的丰富的声乐理论，也没有进行过分析研究与总结，因此，我们民族声乐艺术，在今天，还没有能得到应有的发展。今天全国戏曲及说唱演员人数有二十余万，每天有上百万的群众听他们的演唱。他们可以说是民族声乐艺术传统直接继承者，他们之间又有不少深受人民欢迎的有名的演唱家具有丰富的经验和高度而精湛的演唱技巧。但由于过去长期历史及社会的原因，大多数的艺人限于文化及科学水平，还不能够对传统经验进行较全面的分析批判、总结整理。同时广大的艺人对自己的演唱艺术也急迫地要求提高。许多著名的演唱家们的宝贵经验也有待我们认真地加以整理和推广。
    另一方面，五四以后，欧洲的传统声乐艺术传到中国，在这三四十年的过程中，不仅逐渐被中国人民所熟悉和喜爱，并丰富了我们的声乐艺术的内容和形式。同时对我们民族声乐艺术的发展，也产生了一定的影响。它移植在我们民族土壤中来，将会开出鲜艳的花朵。但是使它成为民族声乐百花园中真正具有我民族色彩的花朵，还要从理论上和实践上进行许许多
  多切切实实的工作。要更进一步和中国实际情况和民族声乐传统紧密结合。
    这实际上是丰富和发展我们民族声乐艺术这个根本问题的两个方面。在这里，深入地学习、整理、研究、总结我们民族声乐艺术传统经验，使它成为更科学化、系统化的民族声乐理论，又是解决问题的重要关键。而且，要作好这个工作一定要有掌握先进科学理论和精通欧洲传统声乐艺术的声乐家们共同来做。但是，过去由于我们对自己民族声乐艺术传统缺乏正确认识，有的甚至抱有虚无主义的态度，不学习、不研究、更谈不到整理和总结，因此也就掌握不到民族声乐的特点与发展规律；从而对于如何吸收欧洲传统声乐艺术，并进一步和民族声乐艺术相结合的问题也还没有得到很好的解决。广大的艺人，也由于没有一套经过整理的、较有系统的经验理论来指导，他们的演唱艺术也得不到普遍的提高。青年一代演员，培养与训练问题更没有得到很好的解决。这都是继承与发扬民族声乐艺术当前所存在的严重问题。近几年来，学习欧洲传统声乐的声乐家，对民族声乐传统的看法，有了很大的改变，向民族民间学习，也被提到日程上来，但还是停留在口头上的较多，实际动起来的较少，而真正像对学习欧洲传统声乐那样，以严肃而认真的态度，进行深入地学习与研究的更不多，所以成绩也不够大。相信今后会逐渐改变这种情况的。
    继承与发扬民族声乐艺术传统，是桩继往开来的艰巨工作，要完成它需要依靠所有的声乐家的共同努力，尤其是掌握先进经验，学习欧洲传统声乐的声乐家，负有更大的责任。为了发展社会主义民族的声乐艺术，希望所有的声乐家团结起来，切实地行动起来。
