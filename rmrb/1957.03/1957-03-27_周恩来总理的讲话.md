Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Respected Premier Široký, respected comrades of the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic, comrades and friends:

Premier Široký and the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic have visited our country for many days. During these days, they have visited many cities and villages in our country, and have been warmly welcomed by the people of our country everywhere. They have made a great contribution to enhancing the fraternal friendship between the peoples of China and Czechoslovakia. Please allow me to express my heartfelt thanks to them on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people.

The Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic will also visit the northeastern region of our country. There, they will also be warmly welcomed by the people everywhere. The Chinese people thank the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic for bringing the great friendship of the Czechoslovak people to the Chinese people in the cause of China's socialist construction. The Chinese people warmly welcome them in order to convey the best wishes of the Chinese people to the fraternal Czechoslovak people through them. The unbreakable fraternal friendship between our two peoples is the friendship of comrades in the socialist family. The Chinese people are very pleased to see that the friendship between our two peoples is strengthening day by day.

Premier Široký and the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic will soon leave our country for friendly visits to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Mongolian People's Republic. We are convinced that, as with their visits to our country and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, their visits to these two fraternal countries will be a complete success. Although we will soon be separated, the hearts of our two peoples will always be closely linked together.

Just now, Premier Široký excessively praised the achievements of the Chinese people, but there are still many difficulties to be overcome by the Chinese people, and there are still many shortcomings and errors in our work that need to be corrected. Thank you, Comrade Široký, for your praise. We are willing to take this praise as an encouragement to urge us to work better, to better learn from the advanced experience of fraternal countries, to better learn from the strengths of all countries and nations in the world, and to work harder for world peace.

Dear comrades and friends, let us raise our glasses:

For the prosperity and strength of the Czechoslovak Republic,

For the close unity and eternal friendship between China and Czechoslovakia,

For the great unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union,

For world peace,

For the health of Premier Viliam Široký and his wife and all the comrades of the delegation,

Cheers to the health of Comrade Antonín Zápotocký, President of the Czechoslovak Republic!

　　周恩来总理的讲话敬爱的总理同志，敬爱的捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团全体同志们，同志们和朋友们：
    西罗基总理和捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团已经在我们国家访问许多天了。在这些日子里，他们访问了我国的许多城市和乡村，到处受到我国人民的热烈欢迎。他们为增进中捷两国人民兄弟般的友谊作了巨大的贡献。请允许我代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民向他们表示衷心的感谢。
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团还将要访问我国的东北地区。在那里，他们将同样受到各地人民的热烈欢迎。中国人民感谢捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团给中国人民带来了捷克斯洛伐克人民的伟大友谊，中国人民把我们的贵宾看作是捷克斯洛伐克人民的伟大使者。中国人民热烈地欢迎他们，是为了表示感谢捷克斯洛伐克人民在中国社会主义建设的事业中给予中国人民的伟大援助。中国人民热烈地欢迎他们，是为了通过他们把中国人民最好的愿望带给兄弟般的捷克斯洛伐克人民。我们两国人民兄弟般的牢不可破的友谊是社会主义大家庭中的同志的友谊。中国人民十分高兴地看到，我们两国人民的友谊一天比一天地在加强起来。
    西罗基总理和捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团，不久就要离开我们国家去朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和蒙古人民共和国进行友好的访问，我们深信，如同他们对我国和越南民主共和国的访问一样，他们对这两个兄弟国家的访问一定也会获得圆满的成功。我们虽然很快就要分别了，但是我们两国人民的心将永远紧紧地连结在一起。
    刚才西罗基总理过分地称赞了中国人民的成就，但是摆在中国人民面前还有很多困难须要克服，我们工作中还有不少缺点和错误须要纠正。感谢西罗基同志对我们的称赞，我们愿意把这种称赞作为一种鼓励，督促我们更好地工作，更好地学习兄弟国家的先进经验，更好地学习世界所有国家和民族的长处，更好地为世界和平而努力。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们，让我们举杯：
    为捷克斯洛伐克共和国的繁荣和富强，
    为中捷两国的亲密团结和永恒的友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义各国的伟大团结，
    为世界和平，
    为威廉·西罗基总理和夫人以及代表团全体同志们的健康，
    为捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统安托宁·萨波托斯基同志的健康，干杯！
