Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 25th: The Soviet Union is implementing a massive plan to establish a unified power grid connecting all of the country's power plants. According to this plan, hundreds of Soviet power plants will be connected by numerous high-voltage transmission lines, uniformly operated by one or several dispatching stations. This power grid will encompass the entire Soviet Union, which occupies one-sixth of the Earth's landmass.

As early as fifty-one years ago (1906), the Russian writer Kuprin proposed such a bold ideal in a novel. He hoped that the construction of a unified high-voltage transmission network would begin in Russia a thousand years later (2906). At the time, his ideal was regarded as merely a "fantastic scientific fantasy." However, this writer's fantasy has turned into a practical plan in just half a century.

The first stage of realizing this plan is to establish a unified power grid in the European part of the Soviet Union during this Five-Year Plan period, connecting the existing Ural power grid, the Central power grid, and the Southern power grid through the large hydroelectric power stations on the Volga River. Currently, the first part of this project (the 400,000-volt Kuibyshev-Moscow high-voltage transmission line) has been completed, connecting the Central power grid to the Volga River basin. Another 400,000-volt high-voltage transmission line from Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station to the Urals is under construction and will be completed during the Five-Year Plan period. It will enable the Central power grid to connect with the Ural power grid through the Volga River basin.

The hub connecting the above two power grids with the Southern power grid is the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station, which is under construction. Currently, two long-distance high-voltage transmission lines originating from here (the 400,000-volt Stalingrad-Moscow transmission line and the 800,000-volt Stalingrad-Donbass transmission line) have already begun construction. Once these two transmission lines are completed, a unified power grid in the European part of the Soviet Union will be formed, and the electricity generated by its various power plants will account for about half of the total electricity production in the entire Soviet Union.

At the same time, the unification of the power grids of the Georgian, Armenian, and Azerbaijani republics is also underway. Like the power plants in Leningrad, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and other places in the northwestern region of the Soviet Union, they will soon be incorporated into the unified power grid in the European part of the Soviet Union.

In Siberia, east of the Ural Mountains, preparations are also underway to establish a unified power grid during the new Five-Year Plan period. This power grid is the second largest component of the Soviet Union's national unified power grid. It will include the vast area from Novosibirsk to Irkutsk. After this power grid is completed, 400,000-volt transmission lines will connect the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station on the Angara River with the Irkutsk-Cheremkhovo power grid and the Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Station on the Yenisei River. These power projects are currently in the initial stages. In the future, the Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Station will also be connected with some thermal power plants in the Kuznetsk coal region.

In order to connect the Central Siberian unified power grid with the unified power grid in the European part of the Soviet Union, a 6,000-kilometer-long Siberia-Ural high-voltage transmission line and other east-west transmission lines will be built. Through these transmission lines, 30 to 40 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity from Siberia will be transmitted to the Urals for use.

### “异想天开的科学幻想”正在实现　苏联全国发电站将联成统一动力网

    “异想天开的科学幻想”正在实现
　　苏联全国发电站将联成统一动力网
    新华社莫斯科25日电　苏联正在执行着建立一个把全国的发电站联结成统一动力网的庞大计划。根据这个计划，苏联数以百计的发电站将被许多高压输电线联结起来，由一个或几个调度站统一操纵，这个动力网将把占地球六分之一土地的整个苏联网罗进去。
    还在五十一年以前（1906年），俄国作家库普林在一篇小说中就曾经提出过这样一个大胆的理想，他希望在一千年后（2906年）开始在俄国建设统一的高压输电网。当时，他的这个理想被人们看成只是一个“异想天开的科学幻想”。可是，这位作家的幻想经过半个世纪就在今天变成实践中的计划了。
    实现这个计划的第一个阶段就是，在这一个五年计划期间建立起苏联欧洲部分的统一动力网，通过伏尔加河上的大水电站，把现在的乌拉尔电力网、中央电力网和南部电力网联结起来。现在，这个工程的第一部分（四十万伏特电压的古比雪夫—莫斯科高压输电线）已经完成，它把中央动力网同伏尔加河流域联在一起。另一条从古比雪夫水电站到乌拉尔的四十万伏特电压的高压输电线正在建设中，将在五年计划期间完成。它将使中央电力网经过伏尔加河流域同乌拉尔电力网联结起来。
    上述两条电力网同南部电力网联结起来的枢纽是建设中的斯大林格勒水电站。现在，以这里为起点的两条远距离高压输电线（四十万伏特电压的斯大林格勒—莫斯科输电线和八十万伏特电压的斯大林格勒—顿巴斯输电线）已经开始建设。这两条输电线建成后，苏联欧洲部分统一的动力网就形成了，它的各个发电站所生产的电力，将占全苏联电力总产量的一半左右。
    和这同时，格鲁吉亚、亚美尼亚和阿塞拜疆共和国动力网的统一工作目前也在进行。它们也将和苏联西北地区的列宁格勒、立陶宛、拉脱维亚、爱沙尼亚等地的发电站一样，在不久的将来纳入苏联欧洲部分统一动力网中。
    在乌拉尔山以东的西伯利亚，新五年计划期间也准备开始建立统一动力网。这个动力网是苏联全国统一动力网的第二个最大的组成部分。它将包括从新西伯利亚城到伊尔库次克之间的广大地区。这个动力网建成以后，四十万伏特的输电线将把安加拉河上的布拉次克水电站同伊尔库次克—切利姆霍伏动力网以及叶尼塞河上的克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站联结起来。这些电力工程目前都还是处在开始的阶段。将来，克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站还要同库兹涅茨克煤区的一些火力发电站联结在一起。
    为了把中西伯利亚统一动力网同苏联欧洲部分统一动力网联结起来，还将建设长约六千公里的西伯利亚—乌拉尔高压输电线和其他一些东西向的输电线。通过这些输电线，西伯利亚的三、四百亿度电力将输送到乌拉尔使用。
