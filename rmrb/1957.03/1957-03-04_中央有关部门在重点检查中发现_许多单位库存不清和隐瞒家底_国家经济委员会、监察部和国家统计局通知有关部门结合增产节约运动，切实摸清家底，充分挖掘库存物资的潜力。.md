Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd. The State Economic Commission, the Ministry of Supervision, and the State Statistical Bureau of the People's Republic of China recently conducted a focused inspection of the material inventory situation of several production and capital construction units. The inspection results proved that many units have serious problems with unclear inventory situations and underreporting of inventory, which has artificially created a tight material supply situation to a certain extent.

At the end of last year, the State Economic Commission, the Ministry of Supervision, and the State Statistical Bureau jointly notified all relevant departments, requiring them to conduct a comprehensive inventory check and properly handle surplus stockpiled materials in order to thoroughly clarify their "assets" and correctly arrange this year's production and capital construction plans. Subsequently, state supervision organs at all levels and planning, statistics, supply, and other departments organized several thousand cadres. Based on the inventory reports of various units as of January 1st, they conducted focused inspections of the stockpiled materials of six to seven hundred production and capital construction units. During the inspection, it was found that the phenomenon of underreporting stockpiled materials was quite common in some units, and the quantity of underreported materials was also very large. Preliminary statistics from the inspection of only a dozen departments such as railways and metallurgy, and some key enterprises in provinces and cities such as Liaoning and Beijing, showed that more than 70,000 tons of steel and more than 140,000 cubic meters of timber were underreported. In a sample survey of 274 state-owned enterprises under eleven departments, including the metallurgical industry and the First Ministry of Machine Building, 197 units underreported steel, with the total underreported steel accounting for 8.6% of the original reported amount, and underreported timber accounting for 13.6% of the original reported amount. Liaoning, Beijing, and other provinces and cities inspected 140 local state-owned enterprises, with underreported steel accounting for 18.5% of the original reported amount, and underreported timber accounting for 23.6% of the original reported amount.

In some departments, the situation of unclear "assets" is very serious. The preliminary results of the Ministry of Construction Engineering's inventory check on January 1st of this year showed that the stock of ferrous metals was almost double the estimated amount in early December last year; the original estimate was that there would be a shortage of tens of thousands of cubic meters of timber, but in reality, not only was there no shortage, but there was also a surplus of more than one hundred thousand cubic meters.

The situation during the inspection shows that the phenomenon of underreporting inventory is so serious because some units have chaotic management, lack a clear understanding of the situation, and have not seriously conducted inventory and statistics according to national regulations. However, some units deliberately conceal and underreport due to departmentalism. Some even falsify accounts, disperse materials, conceal information at each level, and underreport at each level. The Taiyuan Iron Factory deliberately removed more than 300 tons of steel and pig iron from the accounts on December 31st of last year and did not report them as inventory.

The inspection also revealed that the inventory of some departments and enterprises this year has increased to a considerable extent compared with the beginning of last year, exceeding the normal reserve level. The steel inventory of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and other departments is more than the actual consumption in half a year of 1956. At the beginning of this year, the directly affiliated engineering companies of the Ministry of Construction Engineering had an inventory of more than 12,000 tons of steel and other ferrous metals, more than double the amount at the beginning of last year. If calculated based on the company's actual consumption for the entire year last year, it could be used for one year and eight months. At the same time, there is a relatively widespread phenomenon of having too much of some things and too little of others, uneven distribution of resources, between departments and departments, enterprises and enterprises, especially in terms of variety and specifications. There is a large accumulation of materials here, and work is suspended due to lack of materials there, without reasonable adjustment. This situation shows that the potential of stockpiled materials in the current industrial production and capital construction departments is still very large.

After this comprehensive inventory check and focused inspection of some departments, the "assets" of some departments and enterprises have been further clarified, which has created favorable conditions for correctly arranging this year's production and capital construction plans and better carrying out the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign. However, a small number of departments and enterprises have insufficient understanding of the significance of checking stockpiled materials and have not seriously organized forces to conduct inspections. Therefore, the situation of unclear inventory and inaccurate statistics still exists. Now, the State Economic Commission, the Ministry of Supervision, and the State Statistical Bureau have notified relevant departments to further improve this work in conjunction with the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, thoroughly clarify their "assets," and fully explore the potential of stockpiled materials.

    中央有关部门在重点检查中发现
    许多单位库存不清和隐瞒家底
    国家经济委员会、监察部和国家统计局通知有关部门结合增产节约运动，切实摸清家底，充分挖掘库存物资的潜力。
    据新华社3日讯  中华人民共和国国家经济委员会、监察部和国家统计局最近联合对若干生产和基本建设单位的物资库存情况进行了重点检查。检查的结果证明：许多单位对库存情况不清和少报库存的现象相当严重，在一定程度上人为地制造了物资供应紧张的状况。
    国家经济委员会、监察部和国家统计局去年年底就曾联合通知各有关部门，要求作好库存普查和处理好多余的库存物资，以便切实弄清“家底”，正确地安排今年的生产和基本建设计划。接着，各级国家监察机关和各级计划、统计、供应等部门又组织了几千名干部，根据各单位1月1日库存物资普查报告，对六、七百个生产和基本建设单位的库存物资进行了重点检查。在检查中，发现一些单位少报库存物资的现象相当普遍，少报库存物资的数量也很大。仅铁道、冶金等十几个部门和辽宁、北京等省、市一些重点企业的检查，初步统计少报的钢材有七万多吨，木材有十四万多立方公尺。在抽查的冶金工业、第一机械工业等十一个部门的二百七十四个国营企业单位中，有一百九十七个单位少报了钢材，全部少报的钢材占原报告数的8.6％，少报的木材占原报告数的13.6％。辽宁、北京等省、市检查了一百四十个地方国营企业，少报的钢材占原报告数的18.5％，少报的木材占原报告数的23.6％。
    有些部门“家底”不清的情况是很严重的。建筑工程部今年1月1日库存物资普查初步结果：黑色金属库存数几乎比去年12月初的预计数增加了一倍；木材原来预计还缺几万立方公尺，但实际上不仅不缺，而且还剩余十多万立方公尺。
    检查中的情况说明，少报库存的现象所以这样严重，有些单位是由于管理混乱，心中无数，以及没有认真根据国家的规定进行清点、统计所造成，但是也有一些单位是由于本位主义的思想作怪而故意隐瞒少报的。有的甚至假造账目，疏散物资，层层隐瞒，逐级少报。太原铁工厂在去年12月31日故意将三百多吨钢材和生铁出了账，不报库存。
    检查中的情况也反映出：今年有些部门和企业的库存物资，比去年年初有相当程度的增长，超过了正常的储备量。建筑工程部、冶金工业部等部门的钢材库存比1956年半年的实际耗用量还多。建筑工程部的直属工程公司今年年初钢材等黑色金属库存有一万二千多吨，比去年年初增加了两倍多，如果以这个公司去年全年的实际耗用量计算，可以用一年零八个月。同时，部门和部门、企业和企业之间，尤其是在品种规格上又比较普遍地存在着此多彼少、苦乐不均的现象。这里大量积压，那里停工待料，没有合理地加以调剂。这种情况说明，目前工业生产和基本建设部门库存物资的潜力还很大。
    经过这次库存物资普查和对某些部门进行重点抽查以后，有些部门和企业的“家底”已经进一步摸清楚了，这就为正确地安排今年的生产和基本建设计划，更好地开展增产节约运动创造了有利的条件。但是也有少数部门和企业的领导上对检查库存物资的意义认识不足，没有认真地组织力量进行检查，因此库存不清、统计不实的情况仍然存在。现在，国家经济委员会、监察部、国家统计局已经通知有关部门，结合增产节约运动进一步做好这项工作，切实摸清“家底”，充分挖掘库存物资的潜力。
