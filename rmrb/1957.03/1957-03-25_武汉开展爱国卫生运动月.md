Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

　　Wuhan is gradually launching its "Patriotic Health Campaign Month" activities, which began on March 20th, in the city proper.

　　Currently, medical workers and science popularization workers in various districts of the city are extensively publicizing methods for preventing infectious diseases and general hygiene knowledge to the masses. Residents of streets such as Zongguan, Baofeng, Minyi, and Labor have already enthusiastically engaged in patriotic health activities, carrying out tasks such as clearing garbage, tidying up ditches, and eradicating mosquitoes and flies. Systems such as the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Industry, the Second Bureau of Commerce, and the Bureau of Handicraft Industry are all deeply mobilizing employees and their families to actively participate in patriotic health activities. Factories and workshops producing sugar, wine, and tofu, in addition to maintaining daily cleaning work, have also signed contracts with some agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs, regularly sending waste sugar residue, wine lees, and bean dregs to the agricultural cooperatives as feed or fertilizer, to prevent the breeding of flies.

　　In order to fundamentally change the environmental sanitation situation in Wuhan, the city has also decided to organize urban construction departments, water conservancy departments, and health departments to jointly study and uniformly arrange municipal construction work according to sanitary requirements.

　　In the past, Wuhan's health department did not conscientiously implement the principle of "prevention first," neglected regular health and epidemic prevention work, and was satisfied with past blitz-style campaigns. The masses in many factories, enterprises, and institutions were not truly mobilized, and some streets and alleys did not persist in sanitation work. The phenomenon of untidy city appearance and dirtiness still existed in some places. In order to change this situation, the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee decided to launch a thorough "Patriotic Health Campaign Month" activity throughout the city and gradually make sanitation work regular.

### 武汉开展爱国卫生运动月

　　武汉开展爱国卫生运动月
    新华社讯　从3月20日开始的“爱国卫生运动月”活动正在武汉市区逐步展开。
    现在，在市内各区里，医务工作者、科学普及工作者正在广泛地向群众宣传传染病的防护办法和一般卫生知识。宗关、宝丰、民意和劳动等街道的居民已开始热情地投入爱国卫生活动中，进行清除垃圾、整理沟道和扑灭蚊、蝇等工作。武汉市工业局、第二商业局和手工业管理局等系统都正在深入动员职工和家属积极参加爱国卫生活动。生产糖、酒、豆腐的工厂和作坊除坚持日常清扫工作外，还和郊区一些农业生产合作社订立了合同，按时将残废的糖渣、酒糟和豆渣送给农业合作社作为饲料或肥料，以杜绝苍蝇的孳生。
    为了根本改变武汉市环境卫生状况，武汉市还决定组织城市建设部门、水利部门和卫生部门等单位共同研究，根据卫生要求来统一安排市政建设工作。
    过去，武汉市卫生部门没有认真贯彻预防为主的方针，忽视了经常性的卫生防疫工作，满足于过去一阵风似的突击活动；不少工厂企业和机关的群众没有真正发动起来，一些街道里巷也没有把卫生工作坚持下来，市容不整、污秽满地的现象仍在一些地方存在。为了改变这种情况，武汉市人民委员会才决定在全市范围内深入开展“爱国卫生运动月”的活动，并且逐步使卫生工作经常化。
