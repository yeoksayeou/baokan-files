Xinhua News Agency: Shandong's five coastal ports—Lidao, Zhangjiabu, Rushankou, Lanshantou, and Hutouya—are undergoing expansion and construction of new terminals.

The original terminal facilities in these ports of Lidao and Zhangjiabu were rudimentary, and the loading and unloading of goods relied entirely on sampans. The original terminal at Rushankou could only accommodate a steamship of less than 100 tons during high tide. Lanshantou and Hutouya are natural ports with shallow water and thin beaches, requiring ships to anchor two or three *li* offshore to enter the port.

After the expansion and construction of new terminals at these five ports, they will no longer be restricted by tides, allowing ships to enter and exit day and night. The average loading and unloading efficiency will increase by one to three times compared to before. (Attached image)

In the ancient canal, transportation is also busy. This is a series of towed barge transport ships, carrying various agricultural implements to the rural areas of northern Jiangsu. Xinhua News Agency reporter Xu Bihua.

    山东扩建新建海港码头
    据新华社讯  山东沿海五个港口——俚岛、张家埠、乳山口、岚山头、虎头崖正在扩建新建码头。
    这些港口中的俚岛、张家埠原有码头设备简陋，装卸货物全靠舢板；乳山口原有码头只能在涨潮的时候靠泊一只百吨以下的汽船；岚山头和虎头崖都是自然港口，浅水薄滩，船只进港要离岸两、三华里抛锚。
    这五个港口扩建和新建码头以后将不再受潮水限制，可昼夜进出船只，平均装卸效率将较以前提高一倍到三倍。（附图片）
