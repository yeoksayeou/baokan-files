A Casual Discussion of "Zhaojun's Departure"
Xu Ke

Last year I watched the Qiyang High Opera "Zhaojun's Departure" performed by the Hunan Provincial Opera Troupe, and this year I watched the Kunqu Opera "Zhaojun's Departure" performed by the Northern Kunqu Opera Troupe. For this same traditional play, the Qi opera and the Kun opera adopted two different approaches.

If you only watch the Kun opera "Departure," it is indeed quite moving. The Kun opera "Departure" can be said to be successful because it expresses Zhaojun's grief and indignation to a certain extent. However, "you can't know the good stuff until you compare," comparing the Kun opera "Departure" with the Qi opera "Departure," I always feel that the Qi opera "Departure" seems to be better.

However, my saying that the Qi opera "Departure" is better is definitely not because I am from Hunan and have watched Qiyang opera since I was a child, and therefore have a special affection for Qiyang opera. My judgment is based on facts.

The Kun opera "Zhaojun's Departure" that I watched this time was generally performed according to the old way. This old way, to put it simply, is exactly as the Kun opera circles say: "Sing Zhaojun to death, act Wang Long to death, tumble the horse boy to death." The Qi opera "Zhaojun's Departure," however, differs greatly from the Kun opera in its handling of these three characters.

The Zhaojun in the Kun opera "Departure" only pays attention to singing, and does not take good care of other aspects. The Qi opera is different. The Zhaojun in the Qi opera "Departure" not only emphasizes singing, but also emphasizes the use of subtext, and more importantly, the acting. For example, in the performance of the Qi opera "Departure," when Wang Long reports: "Civil and military officials send you off," Zhaojun does not sing immediately, but remains silent for a long time. Then, she throws her water sleeves extremely sadly and indignantly, and says in a low but firm voice: "No need!" After Wang Long dismisses the officials, Zhaojun begins to sing: "What's the use of a crowd of civil officials? Even those mighty generals, even those mighty generals are in vain. ..." This kind of expression seems to be much more profound. For example, when Zhaojun in the Qi opera changes into barbarian clothes and comes on stage again, she flicks her cuffs and plucks at the wild pheasant feathers. She looks at her barbarian clothes again and again, and her heart is extremely sad. Over time, the audience can't help but shed tears. I think that if you only pay attention to singing when playing Zhaojun, then even if you "sing her to death," the effect may not be very good, because Zhaojun's kind of unforgettable grief and indignation cannot always be expressed in words.

Let's talk about Wang Long. In Kun opera, Zhaojun and Wang Long seem to have divided the work. Zhaojun is in charge of singing, and Wang Long is in charge of acting. What Zhaojun sings, Wang Long cooperates with what he does. This kind of performance is very unique, but there is a huge loophole. Wang Long in Kun opera is played by "clown". The "clown" Wang Long has made a lot of fools of himself. For example, Zhaojun laments, and Wang Long sings: "She is also a Niangniang (imperial concubine) over there, and I am also a Niangniang here; she is also a queen mother over there, and I am also a queen mother here. The same wealth and the same enjoyment, why grieve, why worry?" It seems that Wang Long does not understand Zhaojun at all. Since this is the case, his acting can be said to have no inner basis at all. This kind of outwardly united but inwardly divided performance inevitably makes the audience feel awkward. The Qi opera is different. Wang Long in the Qi opera is played by a male actor, and he fully understands Zhaojun's feelings. As soon as he comes on stage, he recites such poems: "The autumn wind is bleak as I leave Chang'an, only because the beacon fire rises at the border, the courtiers eat thousands of Zhong of millet in vain, but they teach the beauty to make peace with the barbarians." He also sings with Zhaojun: "Thinking of Chang'an, thinking of Chang'an, it is difficult to return to Chang'an, it is difficult to return to Chang'an." Although he does not have heavy acting, it is not necessary to "act him to death", but he appears on the stage as a confidant of Zhaojun on the way out of the country, which also plays a great role in portraying Zhaojun's grief and indignation.

As for the horse boy, he did tumble a lot in the Kun opera performance, and because the somersaults were good, he also won a lot of applause. However, what is the purpose of tumbling like this? Will this play a destructive role in the heavy tragic atmosphere of this play? This is a question worth considering. Another point worth pointing out is that in Kun opera, when Zhaojun tells Wang Long that she can't forget the love of sleeping with Emperor Yuan of Han (by the way, it may not be appropriate to describe Zhaojun's feelings like this, and there is no such lyric in the Qi opera), the horse boy tiptoes to eavesdrop, and Wang Long spits at him, and then he runs away again. This kind of performance also makes the audience feel very uncomfortable. The Qi opera is different. The horse boy in the Qi opera does not tumble aimlessly, and it is not necessary to "tumble him to death". If he tumbles, the audience will know that this is to show that the mountain road is rugged and difficult to walk. Tumbling like this will not destroy but will enhance the tragic atmosphere of the play. He also did not make any inappropriate performances. His expression is sad as soon as he comes on stage. When Zhaojun sings "Five unforgettable: unforgettable three thousand armored soldiers, he worries about the country day and night, and now, it is a waste of hard work," he is ashamed and can't find a place to hide. It is much more perfect to deal with this role in this way.

From these places, we can see that the performance of the Qiyang High Opera "Zhaojun's Departure" is indeed more successful.

Of course, I don't want to obliterate the achievements of the Kun opera "Zhaojun's Departure" performance. Let me say one more thing, the Kun opera "Departure" still has its successes. We still have to thank the old Kun opera artists and young actors who have worked hard for this play, because they have provided a lot of valuable traditional performance techniques on the stage. At the same time, we must also consider that the script and performance of the Qi opera "Departure" have been reorganized and re-processed, so that it can promote its essence and eliminate its dross. The Kun opera performance, because it is a demonstration, basically maintains its original appearance, and is generally not changed. Therefore, it is inevitable that some dross is mixed with the essence, which is understandable.

"Zhaojun's Departure" is an extremely excellent traditional play. It has at least two major characteristics: first, it is profound in thought, and it severely criticizes the compromisers and surrenderers who adopted a humiliating policy in the national contradictions in Chinese history. Second, it is delicate in lyricism and can deeply move the hearts of the audience. This kind of play is a very powerful weapon for conducting patriotic ideological education among the people. I hope that everyone will pay close attention to it, study it, and make it live well on the stage. I hope that the Qi opera "Departure" will be performed even more brilliantly. I also hope that Kun opera artists will appropriately absorb the artistic experience of other opera genres on the basis of their traditional art, so that this play will be even more moving.

    漫话“昭君出塞”
    许可
    去年看了湖南省戏曲艺术团演出的祁阳高腔“昭君出塞”，今年又看了北方昆剧代表团演出的昆剧 “昭君出塞”，对于这同一传统剧目，祁剧与昆剧却采取了两种不同的处理。
    如果单看昆剧“出塞”，那的确也是颇为动人的。昆剧“出塞”应该说是成功的，因为它在一定程度上表现了昭君的悲愤心情。但是，“不怕不识货，只怕货比货”，将昆剧“出塞”与祁剧“出塞”比较一下，我总觉得祁剧“出塞”似乎还要好一些。
    不过，我说祁剧“出塞”还要好一些，这决不是因为我是湖南人，从小就看祁阳戏，因而对祁阳戏有一种特殊的感情。我的论断，是有事实作根据的。
    这次所看的昆剧“昭君出塞”，大体上是按照老路子演出的。这条老路子，概括地说来，正好如昆剧界所说的那样：“唱死昭君，做死王龙，翻死马童。”而祁剧“昭君出塞”，在这三个人物的处理上，却与昆剧有很大的区别。
    昆剧“出塞”中的昭君，因为只注意到唱，在其他方面就没有很好地照顾到。祁剧则不然。祁剧“出塞”中的昭君，不但着重唱，同时也着重潜台词的使用，更非常着重做工。例如在祁剧“出塞”的演出中，王龙禀：“文武送驾”，这时，昭君并不马上就唱，却沉默了许久，然后，她才极为悲愤地将水袖一甩，低声地、但又是坚决地道出：“不用！”待王龙打发众官退去以后，昭君才开始唱：“文官济济成何用，就是那，武将森森、武将森森也枉然。……”这样表现，看来就深刻得多。又如祁剧中的昭君在换穿番装再上场时，她拂一拂袖口，拈一拈野雉毛，对于自己这一身番装，她看了又看，心情沉痛已极。久而久之，观众也不禁含泪欲下了。我觉得，扮演昭君，如果只注重唱，那么，即便是“唱死”，效果也不一定很好，因为昭君的那种铭心刻骨的悲愤，有时竟非言词所能表达。
    再说王龙。在昆剧中，昭君和王龙似乎是分了工的。昭君管唱，王龙管做。昭君唱什么，王龙就在旁边配合着做什么。这种表演，是很别致的，但是有一个极大的漏洞。昆剧中的王龙，是用“丑”扮的。“丑”扮的王龙，出过不少的洋相。例如昭君悲叹，王龙便唱道：“他那里也是一个娘娘，我这里也是一个娘娘；他那里也是一个国母，我这里也是一个国母。一般的富贵，一般的受用，何须悲怨，何须愁闷？”看来，王龙是全不了解昭君的。既然是这样，他的做工，就可说是毫无内心根据的。这种貌合神离的表演，不免使观众感到别扭。祁剧则不然。祁剧中的王龙，是用生扮的，他完全了解昭君的心情。他一上场，就念着这样的诗：“秋风萧瑟出长安，只为烽火起边关，朝臣枉食千钟粟，却教红粉去和番。”他又和昭君合唱着：“思长安，想长安，要回长安难上难，要回长安难上难。”他虽然没有繁重的做工，不必要“做死”，但他作为昭君出塞途中的一个知己而在舞台上出现，对于描绘昭君的悲愤来说，也是起了很大的作用的。
    至于马童，他在昆剧的演出中的确翻了不少的筋斗，而且因为筋斗翻得好，也博得了不少的掌声。可是，这样翻筋斗，究竟又有什么目的呢？对于这一出戏的浓重的悲剧气氛，这是否会起着破坏作用呢？这就是值得考虑的问题。还有一点值得指出，在昆剧中，当昭君对王龙说到她难忘与汉元帝的同衾共枕的恩爱时（附带说一句，这样来描写昭君的心情，恐怕也不很得当，祁剧中便没有这样的唱词），马童竟蹑脚走来偷听，被王龙啐了一口，才又跑开了。像这种表演，也使观众觉得极不舒服。祁剧则不然。祁剧中的马童，没有无目的地翻筋斗，他不必要“翻死”。他如果翻筋斗，观众便知道这是在表现山路崎岖难行。这样翻筋斗，就不致于破坏反而能增强戏的悲剧气氛。他也没有作出不很得当的表演。他一出场，表情便是沉痛的。当昭君唱到“五难忘：难忘三千铁甲兵，他为国日夜操心，到如今，枉费辛勤”时，他竟惭愧得无地自容。这样来处理这一角色，便完美得多。
    从这些地方，我们便可以看得出，祁阳高腔“昭君出塞”的演出，确乎是更要成功一些。
    当然，我决不想抹煞昆剧“昭君出塞”演出的成绩。我再说一句，昆剧“出塞”也还是有它的成功之处。我们仍然要感谢为这个戏尽过力的昆剧老艺人和青年演员，因为他们在舞台上提供了不少可贵的传统表演技术。同时，我们也不能不要考虑到，祁剧“出塞”的剧本和演出都是经过重新整理和重新处理的，所以能发扬其精华，剔除其糟粕。而昆剧的演出，因为是观摩性质，基本上仍然保持原样，一般的不予更动，因而就不免在精华中又夹杂着一些糟粕，这本是可以理解的。
    “昭君出塞”是一个极为优秀的传统剧目。它最少有两个极大的特点：第一，思想深刻，它对我国历史上在民族矛盾中采取屈辱政策的妥协派和投降派作了严厉的批判。第二，抒情细致，能深深地打动观众的心灵。这种剧目，是对人民群众进行爱国主义思想教育的极有力的武器。我希望大家要很好地注意它，研究它，并且要很好地使它活在舞台上。我希望祁剧“出塞”还要更加演得出色一点。我也希望昆剧艺人在自己的传统艺术基础上，适当地吸取其他剧种的艺术经验，把这一出戏演得更为动人一些。
