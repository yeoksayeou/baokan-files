Xinhua News Agency report: Since February, the average daily amount of scrap steel recovered by various plants and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel has increased by more than double compared to January.

Now, before or after work, groups of workers can often be seen collecting and digging for scrap steel in the Anshan Iron and Steel plant area and construction sites, which stretch for dozens of miles. Many trains, trucks, and horse-drawn carts, fully loaded with scrap steel, are continuously heading towards the scrap iron plant from all directions of Anshan.

On the steel slag field, which spans several miles, workers are operating giant electric shovels, mobile cranes, tank-style cranes, and bulldozers, working day and night to extract slag steel. All employees in the city plan to recycle and extract 300,000 tons of scrap steel this year. Once this plan is realized, it will guarantee an increase of 100,000 tons of steel and save the country more than 10 million yuan in funds.

    鞍钢职工回收废钢铁
    据新华社讯　2月份以来，鞍钢各厂矿每天回收的废钢铁，平均比1月份增加一倍以上。
    现在每当上班或下班前，在纵横数十里的鞍钢厂区和工地上，经常可以看到成群结队的职工在搜集和挖掘废钢铁。许多火车、汽车和马车满装着废钢铁，源源地从鞍山的四面八方开向碎铁厂。
    在纵横好几里的钢渣场上，工人们驾驶着巨型的电铲、汽车吊车、坦克式吊车和推土机等机械化设备，日日夜夜地在开采着渣钢。全市职工计划在今年内回收、开采三十万吨废钢铁。这一计划实现以后，就能够保证增产十万吨钢，还可为国家节约一千多万元的资金。
