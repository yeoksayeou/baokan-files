Shanghai's primary and secondary schools have shown a new atmosphere since the beginning of this semester. Students' learning discipline is normal, and they are studying more diligently than before.

In a junior one class at Chengdu No. 2 Middle School, where classroom order was relatively chaotic last semester, phenomena such as walking around, moving seats, and playing with rubber bands during class have now disappeared. All students listen quietly in class, and if individual students talk, their neighbors will remind them to "listen to the lesson carefully."

Because students can observe discipline and listen quietly in class, they have developed an interest in learning and listen more attentively than before. In a junior three class at Changshu Middle School, cheating during tests has disappeared. Now everyone hands in their homework on time every day, eliminating failures. Students in Class Seven of Junior Two at the school have also automatically organized off-campus groups. In group life, everyone not only does their homework every day, but also sometimes asks each other questions and reviews lessons.

Some schools' students used to kick over desks and chairs, wastepaper baskets, and throw erasers everywhere during breaks last semester, but this phenomenon has now disappeared. Moreover, most students can participate in broadcast exercises, play table tennis, or browse books during breaks. In their spare time, many people automatically participate in on-campus public service labor or recreational and sports activities. More and more students are also participating in wall newspaper work, music, art, sports, and other groups.

Students have a further understanding of the hard work of teachers, and many are respectful of teachers. Most students at No. 61 Middle School and Xinqun Middle School act neatly when class begins and ends and listen to their teachers. Once, during a natural geography class in a class at Chengdu No. 2 Middle School, a student muttered a curse in his seat because he did not listen to the teacher. When the surrounding students heard it, they took the initiative to report it to the teacher after class and asked to educate him.

The strengthening of student discipline in Shanghai's primary and secondary schools is because the schools conducted relatively concentrated ideological education for students in the second half of last semester. At the beginning of this semester, the schools grasped this aspect of work even more tightly. For example, at Puguang Middle School, a series of current affairs reports and discussions on typical bad student incidents in the school helped students to distinguish between right and wrong and recognize their future. At the beginning of this semester, seventy-three outstanding students were commended at the opening ceremony, setting an example for all students. In addition, on the first day of school, the principal of the No. 2 Central Primary School in the Yimiao District made requests to the students, and the students themselves discussed what they should do. That afternoon, the students in Class Five of Sixth Grade wrote a letter to the Young Pioneer Brigade headquarters, guaranteeing that they would meet the requirements put forward by the principal. So far, the order of this class has been very good.

### 上海各中小学这学期有了新气象  学生纪律良好学习认真

    上海各中小学这学期有了新气象
    学生纪律良好学习认真
    本报讯  上海市自这学期开学以来，许多中小学生的学习纪律正常，学习也比以前认真了。
    上学期课堂秩序比较混乱的成都二中初中一的一个班级，过去上课时随便走动、调座位、弹牛皮筋等现象现在已经没有了。全班学生都安静地听讲，偶尔有个别同学讲话，邻座同学就会提醒他“好好听课”。
    由于学生们上课时能遵守纪律，安静地听讲，对学习就发生了兴趣，听讲比以前认真了。常熟中学初中三的一个班级测验时的作弊现象没有了，现在大家每天准时交作业，消灭了二分。该校初中二七班学生还自动组织了校外小组，在小组生活中，大家除每天做好作业外，有时还相互提问、复习功课。
    有些学校的学生，在上学期课间休息的时候曾有踢翻桌椅、字纸篓，到处乱丢黑板擦子的现象，现在这种现象也没有了；而且大部分学生都能在休息时去参加广播体操，或者打乒乓球、翻看图书。课余时间，很多人都自动参加校内公益劳动或文娱体育活动。参加墙报工作、音乐、美术、体育等小组的学生也越来越多。
    学生们对老师的辛勤劳动有了进一步的认识，很多人都做到尊敬师长。六十一中学和新群中学的绝大部分学生在上课下课时都行动整齐，听老师的话。成都二中的一个班级有一次上自然地理课时，一个学生因不听老师的话，在座位上小声地骂了一声，被周围同学听见了，下课后他们主动反映给老师，要求对他进行教育。
    上海市各中小学学生纪律的加强，是因为各校在上学期后半期比较集中地对学生进行了思想教育。这一学期一开始，各学校又抓紧了这方面的工作。像浦光中学上学期通过一系列的时事形势报告，以及本校坏学生典型事件讨论等，对学生明辨是非，认清前途，有很大帮助。在这学期开学典礼上，又表扬了七十三个优秀学生，为全校同学树立了榜样。另外像邑庙区二中心小学在开学第一天，校长就对学生提出要求，由学生自己讨论应该怎样做。当天下午，六年级五班学生就向少先队队部写信，保证要做到校长提出的要求；到目前为止，这个班级的秩序一直很好。
