　　Hengyang City Has New Changes
　　Improved Supply of Non-Staple Foods, Increased Income for Suburban Farmers

　　(Our Report) After Hengyang City, Hunan Province, paid attention to implementing the policy of serving the city in suburban production, the supply of non-staple foods for urban residents has greatly improved. Now, in Hengyang's vegetable markets, people can find many varieties of northern and southern vegetables introduced from other places last year, such as the famous Fujian cauliflower, Guangdong's taro, and Henan scallions. Just outside the city, you can see that each vegetable and fishery cooperative has pens of big, fat pigs, and one fish pond is connected to another. The pond embankments are full of dense orchards, and vegetables are planted on both sides of the embankments, with very little vacant land. According to the person in charge of the Rural Work Department of the Hengyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China: Now, a portion of the meat in the city is produced in the suburbs. Last year, the suburbs raised more than 18,000 fat pigs, an increase of about 70% compared to 1954. More than 70% of the fresh fish and vegetables needed by urban residents are produced in the suburbs. The amount of fine vegetables on the market has increased from 10% to 24%.

　　In the past, Hengyang City was not clear enough about the direction of suburban development, and only paid attention to grain production, neglecting the production of non-staple foods needed by the city. Most of the meat, fresh fish, and vegetables needed by the market had to be transported from various parts of the province and Guangdong. The cost was high and the products were not fresh. The vegetables produced in the suburbs were lacking in variety; the vegetable market was full of radishes and Chinese cabbage in the cold season, and wax gourds and pumpkins in the summer, which was monotonous and uninteresting. Last year, after the suburban farmers achieved collectivization, the Hengyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China began to reverse this phenomenon. It was decided that in addition to ensuring self-sufficiency in grain, efforts would be made to vigorously develop agricultural, forestry, fishery, animal husbandry and other sideline production around the needs of the city. 60% of the water surface of the weirs and ponds was used for fish farming, the vegetable fields were expanded, and each vegetable and fishery cooperative also used the previously wasted, unsaleable vegetable scraps to raise pigs. This not only solved the city's need for non-staple foods, but also increased the income of farmers. Last year, the daily labor remuneration of all eight vegetable cooperatives and two fishery cooperatives in the suburbs reached one yuan to two yuan and ninety-five cents. (Luo Houren)

　　衡阳市有新变化
　　副食品供应好转  郊区农民收入增加
    本报讯  湖南省衡阳市郊区生产注意贯彻为城市服务的方针以后，城市居民的副食品供应工作有了很大改进。现在，在衡阳菜市场上，人们就可以发现福建著名的花椰菜、广东的槟榔芋、河南大葱等许多去年从外地引进来的南北蔬菜品种。一出城外，就可看到各蔬菜、渔业社都饲养着一栏栏的大肥猪，养鱼池塘一口连接一口。塘埂上满植着密茂的果林，塘埂两旁全种蔬菜，很少有空闲隙地。据中共衡阳市委农村工作部负责人谈：现在，市内肉食有一部分是郊区生产。去年，郊区饲养的肥猪达一万八千多头，比1954年增长70％左右。市民需要的鲜鱼、蔬菜有70％以上是郊区生产的。上市的细菜已由10％增加到24％。
    衡阳市过去由于对郊区发展方向还不够明确，只注意粮食生产，忽视了城市需要的副食品生产。市场需要的肉食、鲜鱼和蔬菜等，绝大部分要从省内各地和广东运来。成本既高，又不新鲜。郊区生产的蔬菜，细菜少，菜市场上冷季是萝卜白菜，夏天是冬瓜南瓜，单调乏味。去年，郊区农民实现合作化后，中共衡阳市委开始扭转这种现象。决定除保证粮食自给外，同时围绕城市需要大力开展农、林、渔、牧等副业生产。把60％的堰塘水面利用养鱼，将菜地扩大，各蔬菜、渔业社也利用过去被浪费掉的不能卖钱的脚菜养猪。这样，既解决城市副食品需要，又给农民增加了收入。去年全郊区八个蔬菜社和两个渔业社的劳动日报酬都达到了一元到二点九五元。  （罗厚仁）
