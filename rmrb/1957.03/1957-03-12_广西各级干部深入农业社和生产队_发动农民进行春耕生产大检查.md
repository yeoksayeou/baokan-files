Xinhua News Agency, Nanning – The "Five Checks" campaign, centered on production for disaster relief, is gradually unfolding in agricultural cooperatives throughout Guangxi Province. Through the "Five Checks," many regions have reversed the slow progress of spring plowing preparations. 80% of the province's agricultural cooperatives have already formulated this year's agricultural production increase plans and have successively launched labor competitions.

The "Five Checks" are: checking spring plowing production, checking sideline occupations, checking mountain area production, checking the cooperative's management, and checking production for disaster relief. During the "Five Checks" campaign, tens of thousands of cadres at all levels went deep into agricultural cooperatives and production teams, on one hand mobilizing farmers to carry out inspections item by item, and on the other hand, promoting their active actions to strengthen spring plowing production. After the Pingle Special District launched the spring plowing general inspection, the amount of accumulated fertilizer increased by more than one-third in just ten days. The fifteen counties directly under the jurisdiction of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture began training agricultural technicians in mid-February, with more than 8,500 people participating in the training. Currently, 92 cooperatives in Hechi County have set off a production upsurge.

Before the "Five Checks" campaign, all regions, in conjunction with the rectification of agricultural cooperatives, generally summarized the experience of guiding production last year, clarified the main measures for achieving agricultural production increases this year and current work tasks.

However, there are still many problems in the specific implementation of these policies in various regions, and the work progress is very uneven. Although most agricultural cooperatives have formulated production plans, many plans are not realistic. The province's spring repair of water conservancy projects, especially small-scale water conservancy projects, has been poorly completed. Most regions have not seriously carried out the transmission of agricultural technology and the training of agricultural technicians, and the role of agricultural technical measures has been generally neglected when formulating production plans. In order to solve these problems and enable spring plowing production to be carried out extensively and in depth, all regions have universally launched the "Five Checks" campaign.

    广西各级干部深入农业社和生产队
    发动农民进行春耕生产大检查
    据新华社南宁电　以生产救灾为中心的“五查”运动，正在广西省各农业社中逐步展开。通过“五查”，许多地区扭转了春耕准备工作进展迟缓的现象，全省已经有80％的农业社订出了今年的农业增产计划，相继开展了劳动竞赛。
    “五查”是查春耕生产，查副业，查山区生产，查社的经营管理和查生产救灾。在开展“五查”运动中，数以万计的各级干部深入到农业社和生产队，一面发动农民逐项检查，一面推动他们积极行动，加强春耕生产。平乐专区开展春耕大检查以后，短短十天时间，积肥数量增加了三分之一以上。桂西僮族自治州直辖的十五个县，从2月中旬就开始训练农业技术员，参加集训的有八千五百多人。河池县目前已经有九十二个社掀起了生产高潮。
    “五查”运动以前，各地结合整顿农业社的工作，普遍总结了去年领导生产的经验，明确了实现今年农业增产的主要措施和当前的工作任务。
    但是，各地在具体执行中仍有许多问题，工作进展很不平衡。大部分农业社虽然订出了生产计划，但是有不少计划不切合实际。全省春修水利工程，特别是小型水利工程，完成得很差。各地大多没有认真地进行农业技术的传授和农业技术人员的训练工作，在订生产计划的时候也普遍忽视了农业技术措施的作用。为了解决这些问题，使春耕生产广泛而深入地开展起来，各地普遍发动了“五查”运动。
