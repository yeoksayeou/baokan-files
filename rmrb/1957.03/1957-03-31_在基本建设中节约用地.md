Editorial: Saving Land in Basic Construction

In basic construction, there is a significant waste that has not yet attracted widespread attention. This is the waste of land.

In the construction of industry, transportation, water conservancy, and cities, it is necessary to occupy a portion of arable land. For the sake of national industrialization and the long-term interests of the people, this is necessary and supported by conscious farmers. However, the characteristic of China's agriculture is that there is little land and a large population, with an average of only about three mu of land per person, and most of the land occupied by national construction is relatively good arable land. Therefore, in basic construction, especially in design work, it is essential to cherish and save land.

In recent years, some construction units have one-sidedly pursued so-called "socialist standards," raising excessive requirements for hygiene, fire prevention, greening, etc., arranging building density too high, and encircling too much land for long-term development, thus occupying excessive land and increasing investment in roads, water pipes, power transmission lines, etc. In almost all factory designs, regardless of whether it is necessary, the area of buildings only accounts for 20% or more of the total land use, and vacant land accounts for 70%-80%. Three factories under the Second Ministry of Machine Building alone occupy more than two thousand mu of land for "green belts" outside the factory area. Some construction units, under the pretext of "preparing for future development," often apply for land several times more than the building requires. In fact, not all factories will need to be expanded in the future. Even if some should plan for development, it is not necessary to reserve too much land. However, now not only factories want to reserve land, but even many schools and institutions want to reserve a lot of "development space" when building. In Xi'an, there is a university with only two to three thousand students now, but it plans to expand to twelve thousand students, so although only a few buildings have been built, the land occupies more than ninety hectares. There are also some construction units that want to do everything themselves. Auditoriums, cooperatives, clinics, and children's schools, all want to build new ones in their own circles, unwilling to share with others. The Ministry of Railways has six secondary technical schools in Chengdu, all located in the same area, but each school wants to build a separate large stadium with a football field and a track. The various universities in the western suburbs of Beijing are adjacent to each other, and many public buildings could be built centrally. However, each school acts on its own, causing serious waste of land and funds. There are also some units that could have built on wasteland, but they prefer to occupy good farmland for convenience. More seriously, there are many units that are not in a hurry to start construction, but they take possession of the land early, fence it off, and let it lie waste; even if the plan is delayed or reduced, they are unwilling to return it.

Under these circumstances, the amount of arable land wasted is very large. A survey of thirty-seven units in Lanzhou found that more than 15,000 mu of land exceeded actual needs, some of which had been deserted for four years. A survey of 399 units in Xi'an found that more than 20,000 mu of land had been occupied but not started, and some had become unusable due to changes in plans, but had not been returned to the local government. Most of these occupied lands are high-yielding, high-quality arable land, and many are fertile vegetable gardens near cities.

The most important reason for such serious waste of construction land is that the leaders and designers of these construction units believe that our country is very large, and their unit only occupies a small piece, which is just a drop in the bucket, so what does it matter? They simply do not realize the special importance of saving arable land in our country. They only see that the proportion of land acquisition and compensation for seedlings to farmers is very small in the basic construction investment, so they rarely consider how to reduce land use when formulating plans or designing. They do not understand that if a unit wants a little more land, it seems like a small amount, but when added up across the country, it becomes a problem with a significant impact. Take the 15,000 mu of land occupied by those 37 units in Lanzhou that exceeded actual needs. If each mu yields 300 jin of grain per year, that is 4.5 million jin of grain per year. If each mu yields 10,000 jin of vegetables per year, that is 150 million jin of vegetables per year. Extrapolating to the land wasted by construction units across the country, the loss to agriculture is enormous.

Some leading organs are not strict enough in approving land use procedures, and have not effectively prevented the unreasonable phenomenon of some construction units applying for land too early before the design is completed or approved. Instead, they often approve land use without a design. The People's Committees of some localities have also not closely monitored and supervised the land use of construction units. All of these have condoned construction units occupying too much land too early, creating an opportunity for those who are greedy for more and do not cherish arable land.

Recently, many construction units in Beijing have successively returned more than 7,000 mu of land that had been requisitioned but not used over the years to the local People's Committee for disposal. Most of them have been handed over to farmers for cultivation. Now spring plowing has already begun in the south, and spring plowing is also starting in the north. We hope that all construction units will reconsider their plans and designs and try to occupy as little arable land as possible. Those who have purchased land but are not going to build for the time being are expected to quickly return it to farmers for cultivation. It is hoped that the People's Committees of all localities will strengthen the supervision and inspection of this matter, and when necessary, should recover those lands that are occupied excessively and abandoned. In the future, when requisitioning land for construction, it is hoped that both the construction unit and the relevant competent departments will strictly implement the State Council's measures for land requisition for national construction and strictly implement the approval system. Before designing and deciding on which plot of land to build, the construction unit should obtain the consent of the local government, but at this time do not go through the land allocation procedures. It is best to specifically allocate the land when it is officially ready for construction. At the same time, in the future, general construction units, especially residential and public buildings, should not reserve land for long-term development. Construction units that need to reserve land should not reserve too much, and should not fence it off in advance. They should allow farmers to continue cultivating as much as possible before using it.

### 在基本建设中节约用地

    在基本建设中节约用地
    在基本建设中，有一项很大的浪费至今还没有引起普遍的注意。这就是对于土地的浪费。
    在工业、交通、水利、城市等项建设中必须占用一部分可耕的土地。为了国家工业化和全国人民的长远利益，这样做是必要的，也是为有觉悟的农民所支持的。但是，我国农业的特点是地少人多，每人平均只有三亩左右的土地，而国家建设所占用的土地大部分是较好的耕地。因此在基本建设中，特别是设计工作中必须十分珍惜和节约用地。
    近年来，有些建设单位片面追求所谓“社会主义标准”，对卫生、防火、绿化等等要求提得过高，建筑密度安排得过高，对远景发展的用地圈得过大，因此占用了过多的土地，并且增大了道路、水管、输电线等等的投资。几乎大多数工厂的设计，不管有无必要，建筑物的面积只占全部用地的20％以上，空地要占70％—80％。第二机械工业部有三个工厂，只是厂区以外的“绿化地带”，就占用两千多亩土地。有些建设单位以“准备将来发展”为理由，申请的土地往往超过建筑需要的几倍。其实，不会所有的工厂将来都要扩建。有的即使应该作发展的打算，也不需要预留过多的土地。但是，现在不仅工厂要留地，甚至不少学校、机关在建筑时都要留很多的“发展余地”。西安有一个大学，现在只有两三千人，计划要发展到一万二千人，因此房子虽然只盖了几幢，土地却占了九十多公顷。还有一些建设单位，什么都想自己搞一全套。礼堂、合作社、医务所、子弟学校，什么都要在自己的圈圈里建设新的，不肯与人共用。铁道部在成都有六个中等技术学校，建设地点在一个地段上，但是每个学校都要单独建设一个带足球场和跑道的大体育场。北京西郊文教区的各个高等学校，互相毗邻，许多公共建筑物本可集中建设。但是，每个学校都各自为政，造成了土地和资金的严重浪费。还有一些单位，本来可以在荒地上进行建设，但是为了贪图方便，偏要占用良田。更严重的是，有许多单位并不急于开工，却早早就把地要到手，圈起来，任它荒废；即使计划推迟了，削减了，也不肯退出来。
    在这种种情形下被浪费的耕地，数目是很大的。兰州市调查了三十七个单位，超过实际需要的土地有一万五千多亩，其中有一些已经荒芜了四年。西安市调查了三百九十九个单位，已经占用而没有动工的土地有两万多亩，有些因为计划变更已不用了，但是仍然没有交还给地方政府。这些被占用的土地，绝大部分是产量较高的上等耕地，有不少是城市附近肥沃的菜园。
    建设用地浪费这样严重，最重要的原因是这些建设单位的领导人员和设计人员，以为我们国家很大，本单位才占用一小块，也不过九牛一毛，那有什么关系？他们根本没有认识到在我国节约耕地的特殊重要意义。他们只看到征购土地、给农民补偿青苗的钱，在基本建设投资中占的比例很小，所以无论在拟订计划或进行设计的时候，都很少考虑怎样减少用地。他们不了解，一个单位多要一点地，看来好像数目不多，但是全国合计起来，就成了影响很大的问题。就以兰州市那三十七个单位超过实际需要占用的一万五千亩土地来说吧，如果以每亩年产粮食三百斤计算，一年就是四百五十万斤粮食。如果以每亩年产蔬菜一万斤计算，每年就是一亿五千万斤蔬菜。推想到全国各个建设单位所浪费的土地，给农业所带来的损失是多么巨大。
    有些领导机关审批用地的手续很不严格，对某些建设单位还没有设计或设计未经批准就过早申请用地的不合理现象，没有有效地加以制止，反而常常没有设计就批准用地。有些地方的人民委员会对于建设单位用地情况的检查和监督，也抓得不紧。这些都纵容了建设单位过多过早地占用土地，给贪多喜大、不爱惜耕地的人造成了可乘之机。
    最近，北京已经有许多建设单位陆续将历年征而未用的七千多亩土地交回地方人民委员会处理。其中大部分已经交给农民耕种。现在南方已经在春耕，北方也陆续开始春耕了，我们希望各个建设单位都重新考虑一下自己的计划和设计，尽量少占用一些耕地。已经征购而暂时不进行建设的，希望迅速退让出来交给农民耕种。希望各地的人民委员会抓紧对这件事情的督促和检查，必要的时候应当收回那些占用过多、废而不用的土地。今后再征用建设用地的时候，希望无论是建设单位或有关的主管部门，都严格执行国务院关于国家建设征用土地办法和严格执行审批制度。建设单位在设计之前，决定在什么地段上建设，应当取得当地政府的同意，但是这时候不要办理拨地手续，最好等到正式准备施工的时候再具体地划拨用地。同时，今后一般的建设单位，特别是住宅和公共建筑，都不宜保留远景发展用地。有必要预留用地的建设单位，也不要留得过多，更不要事先圈起来，应当在使用以前尽可能使农民继续耕种。
