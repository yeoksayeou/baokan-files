    Inserting Sticky Rice Cake
    Ji Lingjun
    Around noon on the twenty-sixth day of the twelfth lunar month last year, Aunt Xu, my neighbor, called to me from behind the window: "Sister, do you have time to come and insert dates into my sticky rice cake?"
   "Yes, I do!" I answered and walked out.
    It is our local custom to steam a pot of sticky rice cake made of millet flour during the New Year. A "sky" character is formed on the cake with dates. After steaming, a rectangular piece with the "sky" character is cut off and offered before the "Heaven and Earth" shrine, signifying that the cake is a gift from heaven. In previous years, Aunt Xu always inserted dates into the sticky rice cake for the New Year. She believed that doing so would bring her good fortune in the new year. Her family grows two fen of millet every year, specifically for steaming sticky rice cake. Last year, when the millet was tasseling, there was a flood, and the two fen of millet yielded only half a dou. She still steamed half a pot of sticky rice cake.
    I walked into her house, and she had just lifted the lid of the pot. White mist filled the entire room, and nothing could be seen. Uncle Xu opened the north window, and the mist gradually dissipated. I saw a pot of golden yellow sticky rice cake. Uncle Xu handed me a bowl of freshly washed dates. I rolled up my sleeves, picked up a date, and pointed to the center of the cake, saying, "Shall we insert 'sky' here?" Aunt Xu took two steps forward and said, "Um—don't insert 'sky,' don't insert 'sky'!" I asked in surprise, "If not 'sky,' what should we insert? 'Earth'?" I looked at her in confusion. She said, "I used to believe in heaven very much. I worshipped it, hoping it would bless my crops to grow well and ensure that my family had enough to eat and wear. But, year after year of worship, when drought or flood came, there was nothing I could do. My family could barely afford to eat, let alone wear enough. This year, after joining the cooperative, there was a drought for a few days in the spring, but everyone carried water to plant the millet. In the summer, there was a flood, and everyone went to dig the river, and the crops weren't damaged at all. My family has worked for a year, and besides earning enough grain for the year, we have also saved more than one hundred yuan in the cooperative. I no longer believe in heaven. I won't worship it anymore. I'm steaming this cake for us to eat ourselves."
    I said, "So that's the reason. But what are the dates for then?" Aunt Xu said, "Now I just think the cooperative is good. Let's insert 'Cooperative' on the cake!" "Ah, that's great, that's great! Auntie's progress is really fast. It's a pity that I'm still a youth and still in middle school, and I've fallen behind you!" As I spoke and laughed, I started to insert the dates. Before long, three bright red characters were neatly arranged on the sticky rice cake. The sticky rice cake was extraordinarily yellow against the red characters, and the red characters were extraordinarily red against the yellow cake. Aunt Xu and Uncle Xu were so happy that they couldn't close their mouths. The three of us stood in front of the stove admiring it for a long time. After a while, Aunt Xu picked up the pot lid and said, "Let's cover the pot, cover the pot. These characters will be even more secure."

    插粘糕
    季伶军
    旧历去年腊月二十六日傍晌，邻家徐大娘在窗后喊我：“他姐姐，你有没有工夫，来给我插粘糕枣。”
   “有哇！”我答应着就往外走。
    我们这地方的风俗，过年的时候要用黍米面蒸一锅粘糕，糕上用枣插一个“天”字，蒸熟后割下一块长方形带“天”字的糕供在“天地”神位前，表示糕是上天赐给人的。往年过年，徐大娘总要插粘糕，她相信这样做，新的一年会给她带来福气。她家每年种二分地的黍子，专留着蒸粘糕。去年黍子正在抽穗时发了场大水，二分黍子只打了半斗，她还是蒸了半锅粘糕。
    我走进她家的屋门，她刚好掀开锅，白茫茫的水气弥漫全屋，什么东西也看不见了。徐大爷推开北窗，水气逐渐散去了，我看见一锅金黄色的粘糕。徐大爷把一碗刚洗净的枣子递给我，我挽了挽衣袖，拿起枣来指着糕的正中央说：“在这里插‘天’吧？”大娘走上两步说：“嗯——不插‘天’，不插‘天’！”我惊奇地问：“不插‘天’插什么？难道插地？”我莫名其妙地看着她。她说：“从前我很信服天，我供养它，想叫它保佑我的庄稼长得好，保佑一家人吃得上穿得上。可是，年年供养它，遇上旱灾水灾还是没办法，一家人顾上吃顾不了穿。今年入了合作社，春天旱了几日，大伙挑水把谷子种上；夏天发了场水，大伙又去挖河，庄稼一点没糟蹋。我一家人劳动了一年，除去挣下一年的粮草以外，还在社里存一百多块钱。我再也不信服天，我不供养它啦。蒸这糕自己吃。”
    我说：“原来是这么回事。可是还用枣干什么呢？”徐大娘说：“如今我就觉得合作好，我们在糕上插个‘合作社’吧！”“啊，好极了，好极了！大娘的进步真快呀，可惜我还是个青年，还上中学哩，竟落在您老人家后头啦！”我一面说笑，一面动手插起来，不一会三个鲜红的大字整齐地排列在粘糕上。粘糕被红字衬得格外黄，红字被黄糕衬得格外红。徐大娘、徐大爷喜得连嘴都合不上。我们三个人站在锅台前欣赏了一大会。一会儿，徐大娘拿起锅盖来，说：“盖上锅吧，盖上锅，这几个字就更牢固了。”
