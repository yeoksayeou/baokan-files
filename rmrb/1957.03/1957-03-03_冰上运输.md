    Ice Transportation
    By our reporter, Kang Weizhong
    This year, ice transportation has been initiated in Harbin for the first time. To understand this novel undertaking, I went to the Songhua River on the northern outskirts of Harbin. Comrade Zhang Geng, the person in charge of the Ice Transportation Office of the Heilongjiang Shipping Bureau, led me on a tour.
    After walking a short distance on the snow-covered ice, we arrived at the ice transportation station—in front of a mobile tent erected on an ice sled. Six or seven ice sleds, fully loaded with goods, were waiting to be towed by a car to begin their journey. While leading me around, Comrade Zhang Geng explained: Ice transportation was originally a measure proposed by the bureau's employees to increase production and practice economy. It is a good way to overcome the unevenness of busy and slack seasons and balance transportation operations. In Heilongjiang Province, with its severe cold climate, the rivers freeze early and for a long time, so shipping operations can only be carried out for about six months. During the remaining time, despite the availability of manpower and equipment, transportation is impossible, resulting in significant waste. After the employees proposed the method of ice transportation, the bureau transferred some employees who had nothing to do in winter, modified the loading and unloading vehicles that were normally used on ships, established an ice transportation station, and recruited some cargo, and the transportation work began.
    Of course, carrying out ice transportation is not a simple matter. The first step is to build an ice road on the river. This is because, long before the Songhua River freezes, large chunks of ice floe down from the upper reaches. Driven by the wind, these ice floes push and shove, overturning and collapsing, with many standing upright, and some even gathering into piles. When the entire river freezes, these ice floes freeze into large ice packs and steep ice ridges. If these things are not repaired and cleared, the transportation speed will be greatly reduced. In order to build a smooth and flat ice road on this uneven river surface, the Heilongjiang Shipping Bureau mobilized hundreds of employees to flatten the roadbed with shovels and picks in the severe cold of minus thirty degrees Celsius. After more than twenty days of hard work, this clear and mirror-like ice road, five meters wide and one hundred and eighteen kilometers long, was finally completed.
    On January 28, three trucks, each pulling a row of ice sleds loaded with goods, like dragons floating in the river, set off from Harbin for Xin Bayan (a wharf in Bayan County) in the lower reaches of the Songhua River for the first time. From that day on, batches of materials were frequently transported along the long ice road from Harbin to Bayan County. Downstream from Harbin was the flour urgently needed by Bayan County, and upstream from the Xin Bayan wharf was the sugar beet urgently needed by the Harbin Sugar Factory. In the current situation of insufficient transportation capacity in Heilongjiang Province, ice transportation has promoted the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas to a certain extent, and has supported industrial and agricultural production.
    Ice transportation generally involves each truck towing 20 to 25 tons, which is 3.4 times higher than land transportation. Transportation costs are also greatly reduced. More importantly, the success of the ice trial run has turned the local shipping work from "winter slack" to "winter busy," which not only facilitates transportation but also opens up new production avenues for the national shipping department. If this business is gradually promoted in the northern provinces with long freezing periods, the transportation capacity will be increased, and the state can also increase its revenue.
    This year, Heilongjiang Province's ice transportation also encountered some difficulties. Around the Spring Festival, there was a heavy snowfall, and the clearing of the ice road was delayed due to a lack of adequate snow removal machinery in advance, which affected normal transportation. Now, the shipping bureau is studying the manufacture of ice road repair machinery. After learning from this year's experiences and lessons, large-scale ice transportation will be launched on the Songhua River next year.

    冰上运输
    本报记者  康伟中
    在哈尔滨，今年第一次开展了冰上运输业务。为着了解这桩新鲜事，我来到了哈尔滨市北郊的松花江边。黑龙江航运管理局冰上运输办公室负责人张更同志带领我进行了参观。
    在复盖着皑皑白雪的冰层上走了不远，我们到了冰上运输站——在一个冰撬上支起的活动帐篷的前面。六、七个满载货物的冰撬，正等待着汽车牵引启运。张更同志一面领我参观，一面向我介绍：冰上运输原是航运局职工们提出的一项增产节约措施。它是克服淡季旺季忙闲不均、平衡运输业务的一个好办法。在气候严寒的黑龙江省，由于各河冻结期早而且长，航运业务只能办理六个月左右，其余时间尽管有人力和设备，也不能运输，形成很大浪费。职工们提出搞冰上运输的办法以后，局里抽调了一部分冬季无事可干的职工，把平时向轮船上装运货物的装吊汽车改装了一下，成立了冰上运输站，招揽了一批货物，运输工作就开展起来了。
    当然，开展冰上运输也不是件十分简单的事情。首先就要在江里修一条冰道。这是因为，远在松花江没有结冰以前，就由上流漂下来一些大块大块的冰排。这些冰排经风吹动，前拥后挤，翻上倒下，许多都翘立起来了，有些还汇聚成堆。等到整个江水结冰的时候，这些冰排会冻成大冰包和陡峭的冰凌。如果不对这些东西加以修整和清理，运输速度就要大大降低。为了从这坎坷不平的江面上修起一条光滑而平坦的冰道，黑龙江航运管理局动员了上百名的职工，冒着零下三十多度的严寒，用铁锹和铁镐平整了路基。经过二十多天的艰苦劳动，这个宽五公尺、长一百一十八公里的明净如镜的冰道才修好。
    1月28日，三辆卡车分别拖着一列满载货物的冰撬，宛如浮游在江中的蛟龙，首次由哈尔滨向松花江下游的新巴彦（巴彦县境的一个码头）驶去。从这一天起，由哈尔滨到巴彦县的漫长冰道上，经常运输着成批的物资。由哈尔滨下运的是巴彦县急需的面粉，由新巴彦码头上行的是哈尔滨制糖厂迫切需要的甜菜。在目前黑龙江省运力不足的情况下，冰上运输在一定程度上促进了城乡物资交流，支援了工农业生产。
    冰上运输，每辆卡车一般牵引量是二十到二十五吨，比陆运量提高三点四倍。运输成本也大大降低。更有意义的是，冰上试运成功以后，使当地的航运工作由“冬闲”变为“冬忙”，既便利了运输，又为国家航运部门开辟了新的生产门路。如果冰冻期长的北部各省都逐步推行了这一业务，运输力量将会增加，国家还可以增加收入。
    今年黑龙江省的冰上运输也曾碰到一些困难。春节前后下了一场大雪，由于事先没有很好地准备扫雪机械，推迟了清扫冰道的工作，影响了正常运输。现在，航运局正在研究制造修冰道的机械。在吸取了今年的各项经验和教训以后，明年，松花江上将展开大规模的冰上运输。
