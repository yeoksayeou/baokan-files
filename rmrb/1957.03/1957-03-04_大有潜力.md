The sixty-nine credit cooperatives in Ziyang County, Sichuan, saved a lot of expenses after implementing the "fixed quota for expenses" management method last year. According to statistics, last year, with the deposit and loan business of the county's credit cooperatives tripling compared to 1955, expenses were reduced by 45%. The average expenditure per cooperative was only 42 yuan, equivalent to 62% of the total fixed expense quota for last year.

The "fixed quota for expenses" management method itself does not have any secret to saving. The most fundamental reason why this method enabled the credit cooperatives in Ziyang County to reduce expenses by 45% compared to 1955 is that the "quota" controlled people's random spending, and every expense was accounted for. In the past, many credit cooperatives in Ziyang County would always buy cigarettes and "have a feast" whenever they convened board meetings, supervisory board meetings, or member representative meetings, spending a lot of money, resulting in year-end losses. After having a fixed quota for expenses, everyone paid attention to saving, and some unnecessary expenses were reduced.

Is there no potential to be tapped in Ziyang County's credit cooperatives in terms of saving expenses? Judging from the reduced expenses figures above, there is still great potential. When formulating various expense quotas last year, the various credit cooperatives still had some ideas of "being generous in budgeting and frugal in spending," setting the quota too high. This opened a back door for waste.

    大有潜力
    四川资阳县六十九个信用社，去年实行了“费用定额”管理办法后，节约了不少费用开支。据统计，去年全县信用社在存、放款业务比1955年增大三倍的情况下，费用开支却减少了45％。平均每个社开支仅四十二元，相当于去年费用定额总数的62％。
   “费用定额”的管理办法，本身并没有什么节约的秘诀，这种办法之所以能够使资阳县的信用社比1955年减少了45％的费用开支，一个最基本的问题，就是“定额”控制了人们乱花钱，每笔开支都做到了心中有数。过去，资阳县许多信用社，每逢召开理事会、监事会、社员代表会议的时候，总要买纸烟、“打牙祭”，花费很多钱，以致造成年终亏损。费用开支有了定额以后，大家就注意节约了，一些不必要的开支也就减少了。
    资阳县的信用社在节约费用开支上是不是就没有潜力可挖了呢？从上面费用开支减少的数字来看，还大有潜力。各个信用社在制定去年的各种费用定额的时候，多少还存在一点“宽打窄用”的思想，定额制得过大。这样就为浪费开了一道后门。
