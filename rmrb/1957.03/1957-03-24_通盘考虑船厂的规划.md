　　Wang Jiyi said that the Ministry of Communications and the First Ministry of Machine Building did not communicate with each other and each did its own thing, resulting in the waste of manpower and resources in the construction of shipyards in Wuhan and Guangzhou.
　　I wholeheartedly support and agree with the reports of Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and fully agree with Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech on increasing production and practicing economy.
　　Now I would like to offer some personal opinions on shipyard planning.
　　I believe that our work of increasing production and practicing economy should rely on overall consideration on a national scale, mutual adjustment and collaboration, and should not be limited to the scope of various work departments. On the other hand, savings in design and planning are the greatest savings. Savings in the implementation process are already constrained by the design and planning.
　　In the past few years, I have deeply realized from my work that our national shipyards should be arranged and deployed in a unified manner. At present, in addition to the naval factories of a defense nature, the country's shipyards are divided into two major systems. The Ministry of Communications is the ship-using unit, and in order to facilitate the timely control of ship operations, it leads a group of shipyards that mainly focus on ship repair; at the same time, because the shipbuilding industry belongs to the nature of machinery manufacturing, another part of the shipyards that mainly focus on shipbuilding are led by the First Ministry of Machine Building. In the past few years, we have felt from practical work that this policy and division of labor are basically correct. However, on the one hand, because a shipyard is a comprehensive and complex factory, it cannot be simply divided into ship repair and shipbuilding. Ship repair yards must have certain shipbuilding tasks; shipbuilding yards must also be equipped with a certain number of ship repairs to adjust in order to give full play to their role. On the other hand, personnel in the two departments who are in charge of leading shipyard work rarely consult with each other. At most, there are only some daily business exchanges. When it comes to issues such as planning and deployment, they are limited to their own leadership and policies, and it is difficult to participate in opinions. In the past few years, each department has not communicated with each other on equipment investment plans, technical personnel, and worker training plans, and each has done its own thing. Therefore, from this year on, it has begun to feel that there is some surplus in strength. This kind of development has certain losses and wastes on a national scale.
　　For example, the Ministry of Communications began to establish a medium-sized shipyard in the Wuhan area last year to undertake ship repair on the Yangtze River. The investment and plan have been approved and construction has started; however, the First Ministry of Machine Building has a shipyard in Wuchang that has not been fully utilized for a long time due to insufficient tasks after its completion. The Ministry of Communications has established a large shipyard in Guangzhou since 1953 to repair ships in South China, and the tasks are not full. Now the First Ministry of Machine Building plans to build a shipyard in Guangzhou on a large scale for shipbuilding in the second five-year plan. If a unified arrangement is made, the Wuchang factory can be slightly transformed to undertake the ship repair tasks of the Yangtze River, and the Guangzhou shipyard of the Ministry of Communications can be slightly expanded to undertake the shipbuilding of the second five-year plan. The two new factories can be avoided, and the estimated savings are considerable, and it will not cause the utilization rate of the shipyards to drop even lower once the infrastructure plans of the two ministries are completed.
　　In addition, because there is no unified arrangement and mutual cooperation, the utilization of many equipment and machines has not been fully utilized. The most significant example is the utilization of docks. Docks are an important national equipment, with large investment and long construction time. Taking the Shanghai area as an example, the total number of docks should be sufficient under the current situation, but because they are operated separately, some docks are working around the clock, rushing to repair them, and are eager to spend a little time to bring in more ships, while some docks have not been fully utilized for many years, and even some international ships have difficulty finding docks for repair when marine accidents occur upon arrival.
　　Because shipyard work is complex, diverse, and variable, there are also many types of work. Balancing the types of work and reducing the idleness of some workers is a relatively difficult problem to solve. Therefore, it is very necessary for each factory to exchange what it has for what it does not have, and to adjust and dispatch tasks and manpower. If this work is done well, a lot can be saved. Therefore, cooperation between shipyards in the two departments is much more beneficial than working alone in one department. Each factory often has its own characteristics, special equipment, and special technology. Unified arrangement of specialties, mutual cooperation and supply will play a great role in improving quality and reducing costs.
　　Therefore, I suggest that all work related to shipyards should not be limited to the responsible department, but should promote the unified planning and overall consideration of the competent department and the national economic and planning institutions.
　　I only put forward opinions on shipyards based on my personal work position. I think there are similar situations in other work, and I also suggest making some overall unified plans and collaboration. (Attached picture)

### 通盘考虑船厂的规划

　　通盘考虑船厂的规划
    王寄一说，交通部和第一机械工业部互不通气，各搞一套，因此发生在武汉广州各自修建船厂浪费人力物力的现象。
    我衷心的拥护和同意毛主席和周总理以及李富春副总理的报告，完全同意陈云副总理关于增产节约问题的发言。
    现就船厂规划方面，提出个人一点意见。
    我觉得我们的增产节约工作，应该是依靠全国范围中的通盘考虑，相互调剂协作，而不应该把它限制在各个工作部门的范围里。另方面，在设计和计划中的节约才是最大的节约，等到付诸实施过程中的节约已经受了设计和计划的一定束缚了。
    本人几年来从所从事的工作中深深体会到，我们全国的船厂就应该作统一的安排布置。现在全国的船厂除了国防性质的海军工厂外，分了两大系统。交通部是船舶使用单位，为了便于及时掌握船舶的营运，领导了一批以修船为主的船厂；同时因为船舶工业属于机械制造性质，另一部分以造船为主的船厂归第一机械工业部领导。几年来从实际工作中我们觉得这方针和这样分工基本是正确的。但是一方面因为船厂是一个综合、复杂的工厂，还不能单纯的以修船、造船划分，修船厂必须要有一定的造船任务；造船厂也必须配备一定数量的修船来调剂，才能充分发挥作用。另一方面两部门间担任领导船厂工作的人员很少能共同商量，最多只有一些日常的业务往来，牵涉到计划布置一类的问题，就限于各有各的领导和方针，很难参加意见了。各部门几年来不论在设备投资的计划上，技术人员、工人的培训计划上，是互不通气各搞一套的，因而今年起已开始觉得在力量上都有些剩余了。这种发展在全国范围内讲，是有一定的损失和浪费的。
    例如：交通部去年开始要在武汉一带建立一个中型的船厂以负担长江的修船，投资和计划都已经批准而且动工了；第一机械工业部在武昌却有一个从建成后长期没有足够任务加以充分利用的船厂。交通部在广州从五三年起为修理华南船舶建立了一个规模不小的船厂，任务也不饱满，现在一机部为第二个五年计划的造船又拟在广州大兴土木的建立一个船厂。假若统一的安排一下，武昌的厂稍为改造一下同时负担起长江修船任务，交通部广州船厂略加扩充负担起第二个五年计划的造船，新的两个厂都可以不造，估计节约的数字就大有可观了，也不致造成一旦两个部的基建计划都完成后，船厂的利用率降得更低。
    除此以外，因为没有统一安排，互相合作的关系，许多设备、机具的利用也没有充分发挥。最显著的如船坞的利用，船坞是国家的一种重要设备，投资大建造时间也较长，就上海地区论，船坞的总数在目前的情况下应该是够用的，但是因为分别经营，有的船坞日夜三班赶着坞修，挤出一点时间来多进些船舶还唯恐不及，而有些船坞长年的没有充分利用，甚至有些国际船舶到港发生海损事故时难找到船坞修理。
    由于船厂的工作复杂、多样、多变，因此工种也特别多。工种间的平衡，减少部分工人的窝工是一个比较难解决的问题。因此各厂之间互通有无的调剂、调度任务和人力是十分必要的，假若这个工作做得好，就可以节约很多。因此两个部门的船厂如果能通盘合作要比一个部门单干有利得多。各厂又常有各厂的特点，特种设备，特种技术，统一的安排专业，互相协作供应，不论在提高质量、降低成本上都会起很大的作用。
    为此我建议凡是有关船厂的工作，不应该限制在主管的部门里考虑，应该促使主管部门和国家的经济、计划机构作统一的筹划，通盘的考虑。
    我仅就个人的工作岗位上提出有关船厂方面的意见，想必其他工作上也有类似的情况，也建议作一些通盘统一的计划和协作。（附图片）
