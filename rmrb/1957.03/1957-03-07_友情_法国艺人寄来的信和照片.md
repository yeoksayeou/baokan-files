    Friendship
    ——Letters and Photos from French Artists
    Sun Fuxi
    These two elderly people in the photo are French sculpture workers, a husband and wife dedicated to their art. They sent me this photo with their New Year's greetings.
    The vehicle in which the two are sitting is not a car, but a wooden-bodied vehicle powered by human effort, designed and built by themselves, and used for twelve years. France has long had domestically produced cars; of course, those dumped by the United States are even more prevalent. These two artists cannot afford to buy one, and are even less willing to buy such a car. But they were not willing to be without a car, so they used their brains and hands to build this car themselves, driving it daily between their home and workplace, and even taking it to the park for a "stroll."
    The tenacious and unrestrained character of these two old artists is vividly displayed before our eyes.
    The camera they used is a French product—although German and American cameras are numerous in France. This photo was taken, developed, and printed by themselves using a French camera.
    This is how I came to know them:
    After arriving in France in 1921, a female classmate from art school invited me to her home for dinner, saying that a couple of artist had seen my paintings exhibited in the Autumn Salon and wanted to meet me. This middle-aged couple was extremely enthusiastic. When I left after dinner, we arranged a date to visit their home.
    They entertained me warmly, preparing as much as possible my favorite food, books, and artworks. They also solemnly poured me a kind of fine wine, and I recognized the name of this wine as the transliteration of the Cantonese "橘烧" (Mandarin: jú shāo - orange wine). After expressing their hospitality, they earnestly asked me, "We would like to sculpt a marble statue of you. Whenever you have time, sooner or later, for a long or short period, just come to our house for dinner and drink '橘烧'." So, I took the time to visit and became more and more acquainted. The statue was finally sculpted, and they received recognition when the statue was exhibited in the Salon.
    Thirty-six years later, these two artists have changed from middle-aged to elderly people in their seventies, but we have corresponded frequently for more than thirty years. There are many deep impressions in my memory. One time, they talked about the French sculptor Rodin: "Ah! If human society could quickly expose all the errors and ugliness it has already recognized, how quickly would our world immediately become a heaven!" Speaking of this, my friend quoted Rodin again:
    "Art is a good lesson in practicing sincerity."
    In this letter, they said that they received the "People's Pictorial" I sent, and the letter said:
    "We cheer for the artistry of your magazine! From all points of view, it is very beautiful: beautiful meaning, beautiful pictures, especially the beautiful Chinese people...This makes the French feel ashamed. We lent your magazine to many people, and they were all amazed by the achievements of the Chinese cause. You have done amazing and great things. The Americans also send us many publications for free, but at most they are pamphlets about science. They are merchants, and you are artists: you pay attention to people, pay attention to workers, and pay attention to the masses of farmers. Long live the Chinese!"
    When they talked about the current situation in France, they said:
    "We work patiently as usual, but it is difficult. In France, art no longer exists, here there is only absurdity, stupidity, or ugliness. Everything is just child's play. The Salon no longer arouses people's love, people have completely forgotten art, because art no longer serves the people. The result is that artists cannot live! We have no social security at all."
    The distress of French artists makes me feel nostalgic. The past hardships of Chinese artists and Chinese scholars are still vivid in my mind, but many people have forgotten them, and they are impatient when they hear about simplicity and frugality. I introduce the details of French artists for us to compare and remind us of our responsibility to humanity.

    友情
    ——法国艺人寄来的信和照片
    孙福熙
    这照片中的两位老人，是法国的雕塑工人，忠实于艺术的两夫妇。在他们向我贺年的信中，附来了这张照片。
    照片中两人并坐的车子，不是汽车，而是用人力转动的木壳车，他们自己设计，自己制造，已经用了十二年了。法国早已有本国制造的汽车；当然，美国来倾销的更是充斥了。这两位艺人无力购买，更是不愿购买这种汽车。但他们不甘心于没有车坐，所以他们自己用脑用手，制造了这个车，日常开行于住处和工作场之间，还坐了这车去公园“散步”。
    这两位老艺人，顽强而潇洒的性情，活跃在我们的眼面前了。
    他们用的照相机是法国出品——虽然德国的、美国的照相机在法国很多。这张照片就是用法国照相机由自己照自己冲晒的。
    我是这样开始认识他们的：
    1921年到法国以后，美术学校的一位女同学约我到她家中去晚餐，据说，因为有一对艺术家夫妇，看了我在秋季沙龙中展览的绘画而想和我见面。这一对壮年夫妇是热情极了，餐后临别时，约定了到他们家中去的日期。
    他们热烈地招待我，尽量准备了使我喜爱的食品和书籍艺术品以外，还专诚斟满了一种美酒，我认出了这酒的名称是中国广东话“橘烧”的译音。他们极力表示了盛情以后，郑重地要求我说：“我们想为你雕刻一个大理石像。不拘什么时间，迟或早，长或短，都随你便，只要你有空，就到我们家来吃饭，喝橘烧”。这样，我就抽空去玩，愈来愈熟识。石像终于雕成了，而且在沙龙展览这石像时，他们得到了表扬。
    相隔三十六年，这两位艺人已由壮年变为七十余岁的老人了，但三十余年来还常常通信。记忆中深刻的印象很多，其中有一次是他们谈到法国雕刻家罗丹的话：“呵！如果人类社会能够把它已经认识的种种错误和种种丑恶，快快自己检举出来，则我们的尘世将以怎样的速度，立即变成天国了！”说到这里，我的朋友又引用罗丹的话说：
    “美术是练习真诚的一个好功课。”
    这次来信中，说我寄去的“人民画报”收到了，信中这样说：
    “我们为你们杂志的艺术性而欢呼！从一切观点来说，都是很美：美的意思，美的图片，尤其美的是中国人物。……这是使法国人们感觉惭愧的。我们把你的杂志借给许多人看，他们都以中国事业的成就而觉得惊异，你们做了惊人的伟大事业。美国人也白送了我们许多刊物，然而这至多是关于科学的小册。他们是商人，而你们是艺人：你们注重人事，注重工人，注重农民大众。中国人万岁！”
    当他们讲到法国现状时说：
    “我们照常耐心地工作，然而这是艰苦的。在法国，艺术已经不存在，这里只有荒唐、愚蠢或者丑恶。一切只是儿戏。沙龙已引不起人的喜爱，人们完全忘记了艺术，因为艺术不再为人们服务。这结果是艺人们无法生活！我们根本没有社会保险。”
    法国艺人们这样的苦闷，使我怀念不止。中国艺人、中国学者，过去的生活苦闷，还历历如在眼前，但许多人是忘记了，听到朴素节约就不耐烦。我介绍法国艺人的一点一滴，供我们对照，并提醒我们对于人类的责任。
