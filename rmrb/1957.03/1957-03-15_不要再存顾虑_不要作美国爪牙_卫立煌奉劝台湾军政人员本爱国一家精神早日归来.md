Having listened to the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and Vice Premier Chen Yun, I am very excited!

Premier Zhou's visit to eleven countries in Europe and Asia brought back the peaceful intentions of the people of various countries, the noble friendship of the people of various countries, and many valuable experiences and knowledge of the people of various countries in revolution and construction. The far-reaching influence of this visit is inestimable. Primarily, it has consolidated the unity of the international workers' movement and strengthened the forces defending world peace.

I was unable to participate in the inspections in the second half of last year because I was studying at the Socialist Academy. However, in the first half of last year, I visited Hohhot, Baotou, Jining, and Xilin Gol League West Sum Sum Banner in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Datong in Shanxi, Zhangjiakou in Hebei, and other places, inspecting a total of twenty-nine units. The frontier areas, once considered desolate, are now greatly prosperous. For example, Baotou City is actively building the second-largest iron and steel base in the country. Jining City, formerly a small station on the Beijing-Baotou Railway, has now become an important hub on the international transportation line. The Inner Mongolia grassland is one of the important areas for developing animal husbandry in our country. Since the pastoral cooperatives, the lives of the herdsmen have been greatly improved. However, to highly develop animal husbandry and thoroughly improve the lives of the herdsmen, and to improve their economic and cultural level, the original nomadic life must be gradually changed to a settled nomadic life, and finally to a settled livestock raising way of life. The key to this problem lies in water resources. With water resources, both animal husbandry and agriculture can be developed, and the two complement each other. This problem and other problems we saw during the inspection, as well as the opinions reflected by the people, have been dealt with by the relevant departments. Through this inspection, I have two feelings: one is that I have seen the vigorous development of construction in various places, the friendly unity between nationalities, and the gradual improvement of people's lives. This thriving new atmosphere is really exciting and encouraging! The other is that I have learned a lot of practical knowledge through the inspection, and I have also learned about some of the difficulties and problems that exist in the initial stage of construction. Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference this time gave a detailed and thorough analysis of the current various contradictions, which gave me great inspiration for my views on the problems. Therefore, I feel the necessity of deeply studying Marxist-Leninist theory even more.

Last autumn, I participated in the Socialist Academy, and the only purpose of my study was to pursue the truth. However, some people abroad describe this pursuit of truth as "brainwashing." In fact, if we remove the distortion of the word "brainwashing" by reactionary propaganda, "brainwashing" is not a bad word. Because if the old and wrong ideas in anyone's mind are not removed, new and correct things cannot enter.

Regarding the Taiwan issue, as long as the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan and all the compatriots in Taiwan stand up straight and resolutely get rid of the control of American imperialism, then the desire to return to the embrace of the motherland is not difficult to achieve. Old friends in Taiwan, you have been away from your homeland, away from your relatives and friends, for six or seven years. We understand and sympathize with your increasing depression. We have repeatedly hoped that you can promote the peaceful liberation of Taiwan as soon as possible and make a contribution to the unification of the motherland. The brothers and sisters of the motherland will surely welcome you with great enthusiasm. Old friends, I sincerely tell you my heartfelt words, please do not have any more concerns, hesitate, or be American imperialist lackeys. Quickly respond to Premier Zhou's great call, and, in the spirit of patriotic unity, come back soon, and let us work together to build our new China. (Attached picture)

### 不要再存顾虑  不要作美国爪牙  卫立煌奉劝台湾军政人员本爱国一家精神早日归来

    不要再存顾虑  不要作美国爪牙
    卫立煌奉劝台湾军政人员本爱国一家精神早日归来
    听了周总理、李富春副总理、陈云副总理的报告，使我十分兴奋！
    周总理这次作了欧亚十一个国家的访问，带回来各国人民和平的意愿，带回来各国人民崇高的友谊，也带回来各国人民在革命中、在建设中许多宝贵的经验和知识。这次访问，影响的远大，是无法估计的。主要是：一方面巩固了国际工人运动的团结，一方面加强了保卫世界和平的力量。
    去年下半年的视察，我因为在社会主义学院学习，没有能够参加。但是去年上半年曾去内蒙古自治区的呼和浩特、包头、集宁、锡林郭勒盟西苏尼特旗，和山西的大同、河北的张家口等地视察过，共看了二十九个单位。过去被认为是一片荒凉的塞外，今天大大繁荣起来了。如包头市现正积极建设全国第二大规模的钢铁基地。集宁市原是京包路上的一个小站，现已成为国际运输线上的重要枢纽。内蒙古草原是我国发展畜牧业重要地区之一。自从牧业合作化以后，牧民生活已有了很大改善。但要高度发展牧业并彻底改进牧民生活，提高他们的经济文化水平，必须将原来的游牧生活，逐渐改为定居游牧，最后改为定居定牧的生活方式。这个问题的关键就在水源。有了水源，既可以发展牧业，亦可以发展农业，二者有相辅的作用。这个问题和我们在视察中所看到的其他一些问题以及人民反映的意见，都已经有关部门作了处理。通过这次视察，我有两种感想：一种是看到了各地建设的蓬勃发展，民族间的友爱团结，人民生活的逐步提高，这种欣欣向荣的新气象，实在令人兴奋鼓舞！另一种是由于视察学习了很多实际上的知识，也了解到建设初期存在的一些困难和问题。毛主席这次在最高国务会议讲话，详细透彻的分析了当前各种矛盾，使我对问题的看法，得到了极大的启发。因此，更感到深入研究马克思列宁主义理论的必要。
    去年秋天，我参加社会主义学院，学习的唯一目的，就是为了追求真理。可是国外有些人把这种追求真理的学习说成是“洗脑”，其实，如果去掉反动宣传对“洗脑”二字的歪曲成分，“洗脑”并不是坏字眼。因为任何人脑子里旧的、错的思想不去掉，新的、对的东西就进不来。
    关于台湾问题，只要在台湾的国民党军政人员和全体台湾同胞挺起腰杆，毅然决然摆脱美帝国主义的控制，那么回到祖国怀抱的愿望，是不难实现的。在台湾的老朋友们，你们背井离乡，阔别亲友，已经六、七年了。你们与日俱增的苦闷，我们是了解的，是同情的。我们一再希望你们能早日促成台湾的和平解放，完成对祖国统一的贡献。祖国的兄弟姊妹们一定以极大的热情欢迎你们。老朋友们，我诚恳地向你们说出肺腑之言，请不要再存任何顾虑，彷徨徘徊，更不要作美帝国主义的爪牙，赶快响应周总理的伟大号召，本着爱国一家的精神，早早回来，大家一起同心协力建设我们的新中国。（附图片）
