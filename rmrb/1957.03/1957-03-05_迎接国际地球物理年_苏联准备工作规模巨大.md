Xinhua News Agency, March 4th. TASS reports: More than one hundred scientific institutions in the Soviet Union are participating in the preparations for the International Geophysical Year, which will begin on July 1st this year. Many enterprises are manufacturing specialized instruments and equipment for scientific stations. During this International Geophysical Year, 340 new observation stations and observatories will be established throughout the Soviet Union. A fleet of approximately forty ships is preparing to set sail for exploration and research work. Soviet scientists will also organize thirty-five aurora observation stations. These stations are equipped with new instruments capable of photographing the changes and contours of the aurora. In places like Barentsburg in the Arctic, observations of ground currents, which flow on the ground and constantly change in strength and direction, will be organized for the first time. These currents are related to many geophysical phenomena, such as magnetic storms, auroras, and ionospheric disturbances.

Soviet scientists will also conduct comprehensive research on glaciers. Glacier observation work will also be carried out in areas such as Novaya Zemlya and Mount Elbrus. Soviet scientists will study the fluctuation rate and distribution of earthquakes in areas that are difficult to access in the Arctic and Antarctic, such as the Pacific Port and Barentsburg. They have decided to organize some mobile "hopping" teams to carry out this work. The expedition's planes will transport the personnel of the mobile teams onto ice floes. After they have completed all the scientific work, they will be transported to other ice floes.

In some areas of eastern and southern Soviet Union, scientists are organizing geomagnetic and geoelectric observation stations. A new earthquake observation station is being established on Sakhalin Island. A dense meteorological network will be established along the 140-degree meridian passing near Sakhalin Island.

Soviet scientists have also selected the Pacific, Atlantic, and Antarctic seas as comprehensive research sites for oceanography.

    迎接国际地球物理年
    苏联准备工作规模巨大
    据新华社4日讯  据塔斯社报道：苏联有一百多个科学机关参加了将在今年7月1日开始的国际地球物理年的准备工作。许多企业正在为科学站制造专门的仪器和器材。在这一届国际地球物理年，全苏联将要设立三百四十个新的观察站和天文台。包括约四十只船的船队正在准备出发作考察研究工作。苏联科学家们还将组织三十五个极光观察站。站上装备着可以拍摄极光的变化和轮廓的新型仪器。在北极巴伦支堡等地，将第一次组织对地面电流的观察，这种地面电流流动在地面上，强弱和方向不断改变。它与许多地球物理学现象，例如：磁暴、极光、电离层扰动等现象是有关系的。
    苏联科学家还要对冰河进行综合研究。观察冰河的工作还将分别在新地岛、厄尔布鲁士山等地区进行。苏联科学家将在北极和南极难以到达的太平港和巴伦支堡等地区研究地震的波动率和分布情况。他们已经决定组织一些流动“跳跃”小组进行这些工作。考察队的飞机将把流动小组的人员送上浮冰。等他们完成了全部科学工作以后，又把他们运送到别的浮冰上去。
    在苏联的东部和南部的一些地区，科学家们正在组织地磁和地电的观测站。在库页岛上正在建立一个新的地震考察站。沿着通过库页岛附近的一百四十度经线上，将建立稠密的气象台网。
    苏联科学家还选定了太平洋、大西洋和南极海面作为海洋学的综合研究场所。
