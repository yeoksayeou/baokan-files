I completely agree with Premier Zhou Enlai’s “Report on Visits to Eleven Asian and European Countries” and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong’s “Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.”

Prior to this meeting, we listened to Chairman Mao Zedong’s important speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people at the Enlarged Supreme State Conference. At the preparatory meeting of this CPPCC conference, we also listened to Vice Premier Li Fuchun’s "Explanation of Several Issues Concerning the Proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan." All of these gave us great enlightenment.

In February of last year, I led the Chinese government's cultural and artistic delegation on friendly visits to the Republic of Egypt, the Republic of Sudan, the Kingdom of Ethiopia, the Republic of Syria, and the Republic of Lebanon. In July, I led the Hajj delegation organized by the Islamic Association of China on another friendly visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Kingdom of Jordan, as well as Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and other countries, returning home in mid-September. I would like to briefly report to everyone some of my personal understanding of these countries.

We Received a Sincere Welcome from People of All Walks of Life

Most of the countries we visited are located at the junction of Europe, Asia, and Africa, with about 90% of the population adhering to Islam. The people of these countries are very hardworking, brave, simple, and intelligent. These countries all have a long cultural history and a glorious tradition of opposing aggression. The people of these countries, like the people of our country, have suffered or are still suffering from the enslavement and oppression of imperialism. They share our common suffering and have a common desire to safeguard their national independence, oppose imperialist aggression, and strive for world peace. They know that the liberated Chinese people are an important force supporting their national independence. Therefore, the Chinese cultural and artistic delegation and the Hajj delegation were warmly welcomed by government officials and the masses of the people in these countries.

The heads of state and other senior officials of these countries all received us and expressed the friendly wishes of their governments and people towards the Chinese government and people.

Egyptian President Nasser, during our cordial reception, expressed his willingness to enhance friendship with our country. The President of Syria told us: "A friendly relationship has begun between China and Syria, and it will continue to develop." King Hussein of Jordan said, "Congratulations on your visit. I hope this kind of exchange will continue to develop in the future." He also said, "Feel as if you are at home here!" The famous Lebanese writer George Hanna said at a tea party to welcome us: "At Bandung, we and you found the road to unity. We and you are deeply aware that the unity and cooperation between Asian and African countries are indivisible. You are our true friends." When we left Syria, the famous Syrian patriot, chairman of the Committee for the Defense of Peace, and winner of the Stalin Peace Prize, Sheikh Muhammad al-Asima, to express his deep friendship with China, accompanied us all the way to the border, taking us 110 kilometers, and along the way he pointed out the places where the Syrian people had fought against the French aggressors in the past.

The people of these countries have expressed a very deep friendship towards the people of our country. "Friendship with the Chinese people" has become a unanimous call of the people of all countries. Everywhere we went, we could hear people there saying, "We are all Orientals, we are brothers." When we visited the city of Aswan in Egypt, the local people welcomed us with an honor guard. Some people said that such a grand etiquette is only given to the President in Egypt, which shows how much the Egyptian people love the people of our country! When our delegation arrived in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo, hundreds of local workers, peasants, students, and artists went ten kilometers outside the city to welcome us, cheering, "Long live the friendship between the Arab people and the Chinese people!" "Long live Sino-Syrian friendship!" The people of various places received us as if they were welcoming long-awaited relatives returning home, their eyes filled with tears of joy.

This grand occasion was not only reflected in various cities, but also in remote villages. When our Hajj delegation arrived at a village called "Tell" 80 kilometers from Cairo, the local people shouted to us: "Long live the People's China!" "Long live Sino-Egyptian friendship!" "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Long live Gamal Abdel Nasser!" The cheers resounded through the sky. The village was decorated as beautifully as if it were celebrating a festival. When we arrived in Jerusalem, very close to the Israeli border, we were surrounded by cheering crowds, and the cheering sounded not only on Jordanian soil but also on Israeli soil. This cheering could not be stopped by borders.

In various places in these countries, we heard people quoting the saying left by the Islamic prophet Muhammad: "Seek knowledge, even in China," expressing great friendship towards the Chinese people.

This visit has enabled the people of our country and the people of these countries to understand each other better. During the visit to Arab countries, our Hajj delegation once again explained our country's policy of freedom of religious belief and national equality, powerfully exposing the deceptive propaganda of imperialism that our country has adopted a "policy of eliminating religion."

Friendly Cooperation Between Our Country and the Middle East and Near East Has Further Increased

During our visit, we had extensive contact with famous figures in the cultural and artistic circles, education circles, religious circles, and political circles of various countries, further enhancing the friendly cooperation between the people of our country and the people of these countries. We once held talks with government representatives of some countries on cultural cooperation on behalf of our government, and signed cultural cooperation agreements between China and Egypt, and China and Syria. We exchanged letters with the governments of Sudan and Ethiopia, expressing our common desire to develop cultural cooperation. In Beirut, we exchanged preliminary views with the representatives appointed by the Lebanese government on issues related to cultural cooperation between China and Lebanon.

The Sentiment Against Imperialism is Even Stronger

During the visit, we saw that the people of the Middle East and Near East are very hateful of imperialism, especially after the Suez Canal issue occurred, this hatred became even stronger. Imperialism has forced the people of these countries to rise up against it. Under the general goal of opposing imperialist aggression, the people of these countries, regardless of ethnicity, religious belief, political affiliation, or social status, have united together. Opposing imperialist aggression has become the common call of the broad masses of the Middle East and Near East countries. We personally saw many elderly religious leaders exposing the crimes of imperialism in mosques, churches, and mass rallies, calling on everyone to unite and resist aggression. It is clear that in these countries, those who firmly oppose imperialism are respected by the people, and those who shield imperialist aggression are spurned by the people. For example, President Nasser, precisely because he resolutely safeguards Egypt's sovereignty and the national interests of Arab countries, and resolutely resists imperialist aggression, enjoys the highest prestige not only in Egypt but also among the people of Arab countries. During our visit to Arab countries, we heard people everywhere talking about: "President Nasser is a hero of the Arab people." In the Arab countries we visited, we saw that every car had a portrait of President Nasser inlaid on it. In addition, there are also a few national scoundrels in these countries who wave the flag for imperialism, but the deceptive propaganda of imperialism is ultimately bankrupt in the minds of the broad masses of the people.

The Arab People Have Seen Through the Conspiracy of the United States

Following the failure of the war of aggression against Egypt launched by Britain, France, and Israel, US imperialism openly clamored to replace Britain and France in their colonial position in the Middle East and Near East. The so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" is a conspiracy plan to achieve this goal. US imperialists claim that the Eisenhower Doctrine is a policy to maintain the religion of the Middle East and Near East and to maintain the Islamic holy sites. Sixty years ago, when German Emperor Wilhelm II visited Syria and Palestine, he also called himself the protector of 300 million Muslims, and even Hitler did not forget to use similar words. But historical facts have refuted their lies.

No matter how decorated, the purpose of the Eisenhower Doctrine is clearly to plunder the oil resources and other wealth of these countries. The oil resources of Arab countries account for two-thirds of the oil resources of capitalist countries. In 1955, 162 million tons of oil were produced here, accounting for a quarter of the oil production of capitalist countries. The essence of the Eisenhower Doctrine is to steal these riches and establish military bases here to become strongholds for launching wars of aggression. Their cry to maintain the Islamic holy sites in the Middle East and Near East is merely to deceive the world. We warn Eisenhower: Rather than caring about the Muslims of the Middle East and Near East, it is better to immediately stop the atrocities of killing black people in the United States. In fact, the Arab people have seen through the conspiracy of the United States, and the fact that the Eisenhower Doctrine has not yet succeeded is proof. And we heard people in these countries saying: "We demand to enhance friendship with the People's China, demand Chinese assistance, and never hope that American and British imperialism will give us benefits." Not long ago, I received letters from many friends in Arab countries, all of whom expressed their firm opposition to imperialism and their determination to safeguard their country's sovereignty and national independence. The famous Syrian painter and peace fighter, Shayed Tahsin, wrote in his letter: "The people of Asia and Africa and peace-loving people all over the world, united together, will certainly be able to smash the vicious plans of imperialism and their accomplices…"

Recently, Britain is preparing to launch another invasion of Yemen on a larger scale than before. If British imperialism does not accept the lessons of the failure of the war against Egypt and really launches a war in a frenzy, I believe that the people of our country and peace-loving people all over the world will resolutely give full support to the righteous people of Yemen, just as they did to the people of Egypt.

We have realized that, inspired by the spirit of the Bandung Conference, the strength of the people of the Middle East and Near East countries to safeguard their national independence, break free from the shackles of colonialism, and oppose imperialist aggression is growing day by day. This is unstoppable by any force. The just struggle of the people of the Middle East and Near East will surely win the final victory, and the colonialist system will surely collapse throughout the world.

    中近东人民对我国人民有着深厚的友谊
    包尔汉谈两次访问阿拉伯国家的观感
    我完全同意周恩来总理“关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告”和陈叔通副主席 “关于中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告”。
    这次会议以前，我们在最高国务会议扩大会议上听了毛泽东主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的重要讲话，在这次政协会议的预备会议上又听了李富春副总理 “关于第二个五年计划建议的若干问题的说明”。所有这些，均给我们很大启示。
    去年2月间我带领了我国政府派出的文化艺术代表团到埃及共和国、苏丹共和国、埃塞俄比亚王国、叙利亚共和国以及黎巴嫩共和国进行了友好访问；7月间我又带领我国伊斯兰教协会组织的朝觐团到沙特阿拉伯王国、约旦王国以及埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩等国家再一次进行了友好访问，直到9月中旬返国。我想将我个人对这些国家了解的一些情况，向各位简单报告一下。
  我们受到各阶层人民的真诚欢迎
    我们访问过的这些国家，大多处于欧洲、亚洲和非洲的接壤地带，90％左右的人口信仰伊斯兰教。这些国家的人民都是非常勤劳、勇敢、纯朴和富有智慧的。这些国家都具有悠久的文化历史和反对侵略的光荣传统。这些国家的人民也都和我国人民一样曾经遭受过甚至现在还遭受着帝国主义的奴役压迫，他们和我们有过共同的苦难，都有维护自己民族独立，反对帝国主义侵略，争取世界和平的共同愿望，他们知道解放了的中国人民是支持他们民族独立的重要力量。因而我国文化艺术代表团和朝觐团在这些国家里，受到了政府官员和人民群众的热烈欢迎。
    这些国家的元首和其他高级官员都先后接见了我们，同时向我们表示了他们政府和人民对中国政府和人民的友好愿望。
    埃及纳赛尔总统在亲切地接待我们的时候，表示了愿与我国增进友谊。叙利亚总统对我们说：“中国与叙利亚之间开始了友谊关系，它会得到日益发展。”约旦国王候赛因说：“祝贺你们的光临，我希望这种往来今后不断发展。”并且又说：“你们在这里，就像到了自己的家里一样感受吧！”黎巴嫩的著名作家乔治·哈纳先生在欢迎我们的茶会上讲：“在万隆我们和你们找到了团结的道路，我们和你们都深深地意识到亚非国家间的团结和合作是不可分裂的。你们是我们真正的朋友。”当我们离开叙利亚的时候，叙利亚著名的爱国者、保卫和平委员会的主席并荣获斯大林和平奖金的谢依合·木合买提·阿西买热，为了表示对中国深厚的友谊，一直把我们送到国界上，陪我们走了一百一十公里，沿途还指引我们看了叙利亚人民过去反抗法国侵略同法军交战的地方。
    这些国家的人民对我国人民表示着非常深厚的友谊，“和中国人民友好”已经成为各国人民一致的呼声。我们每到一处都能听到那里的人们说：“我们都是东方人，我们是弟兄。”当我们访问埃及阿斯旺城市的时候，当地人民群众排着仪仗队欢迎我们。有人说在埃及只有对总统才会给予这种非常隆重的礼节，可见埃及人民对我国人民是多么地爱戴啊！当我们代表团到达叙利亚北部阿勒颇城市访问时，当地工人、农民、学生和艺术家等数百人走出市郊十公里以外欢迎我们，他们向我们欢呼：“阿拉伯人民和中国人民友好万岁！”“中叙友谊万岁！”各地人民仿佛见了盼望已久的亲友重返家园似的接待了我们，他们高兴的两眼充满了喜泪。
    这种盛况，不仅表现在各个城市，而且也表现在遥远的乡村。当我国朝觐团到达距离开罗八十公里的一个名叫“泰勒”村庄的时候，当地人民向我们高呼：“人民中国万岁！”“中埃友谊万岁！”“毛泽东万岁！”“加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔万岁！”欢呼之声响彻云霄。这个村庄装饰得也像欢度节日似的美丽。当我们到达耶路撒冷距离以色列边境很近的地方，我们被欢呼的人群围绕着，欢呼的声音不仅响彻在约旦的土地上，也响彻在以色列的土地上。这种欢呼声是边界阻挡不住的。
    我们在这些国家的各个地方，听到那里的人民也以伊斯兰教的圣人穆罕默德留下的格言：“学问即是在中国，你们也要学习。”对中国人民表示了极大的友情。
    经过这次访问，使我国人民与这些国家的人民彼此之间更加了解了。我国朝觐团在阿拉伯各国访问中，再次说明了我国信仰宗教自由和民族平等的政策，有力地揭穿了帝国主义诬蔑我国对宗教采取“消灭政策”的欺骗宣传。
  我国同中近东各国的
  友好合作有了进一步
    的增长
    我们访问期间，同各国文化艺术界、教育界、宗教界以及政治界的著名人士进行了广泛的接触，进一步增进了我国人民和这些国家人民之间的友好合作。我们曾经代表我国政府同一些国家的政府代表举行了有关文化合作的会谈，签订了中国和埃及，中国和叙利亚的文化合作协定，同苏丹和埃塞俄比亚两国政府互换了信件，表示了发展文化合作的共同愿望。在贝鲁特，我们同黎巴嫩政府所指派的代表，就有关中黎两国文化合作的问题交换了初步意见。
  反对帝国主义的情绪更加强烈
    访问期间，我们看到中近东人民非常仇恨帝国主义，特别是苏伊士运河问题发生后，这种仇恨更加强烈了。帝国主义迫使这些国家的人民起来反对它。在反对帝国主义侵略的总目标下，这些国家的人民不分民族、宗教信仰、政治派别、社会地位，已经团结起来，反对帝国主义侵略已经成为中近东各国广大群众的共同呼声。我们亲眼看见许多年长的宗教领袖在礼拜寺、教堂，在群众大会上揭露帝国主义的罪恶，号召大家团结起来抵抗侵略。很明显，在这些国家，凡是坚决反对帝国主义的人都受到了人们的尊敬，凡是庇护帝国主义侵略的人都遭到了人们的唾弃。例如纳赛尔总统，正是由于他坚决维护埃及的主权和阿拉伯各国的民族利益，坚决抵抗帝国主义侵略，所以他不仅在埃及，而且在阿拉伯各国人民中享有最高的威信。我们在阿拉伯各国访问中到处都听到人们谈论着：“纳赛尔总统是阿拉伯人民的英雄。”在我们所到的阿拉伯国家，看见每个汽车上都镶着纳赛尔总统的肖像。另外，在这些国家中也还有少数民族败类为帝国主义摇旗呐喊，但帝国主义的欺骗宣传在广大人民的心目中，终归是破产了。
  阿拉伯人民看穿了美国的阴谋
    继英法和以色列发动的侵略埃及的战争失败以后，美国帝国主义公开叫嚣要代替英法在中近东的殖民地位。所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”就是为了达到这种目的的阴谋计划。美帝国主义者把艾森豪威尔主义说成是维护中近东宗教，维护伊斯兰教圣地的政策。六十年前德国皇帝威廉第二访问叙利亚、巴勒斯坦的时候，也把自己说成是三万万穆斯林的保护者，甚至希特勒都没有忘掉采用类似这样的话。但是历史事实驳倒了他们的谎言。
    艾森豪威尔主义不管怎样粉饰，其目的显然是为了掠夺这些国家的石油资源和其他财富。阿拉伯国家的石油资源占资本主义国家石油资源的三分之二，1955年这里出产的石油达一亿六千二百万吨，占资本主义国家石油出产量的四分之一。艾森豪威尔主义的本质就是为了窃取这些财富，并在这里建立军事基地，成为发动侵略战争的据点。他们叫喊维护中近东的伊斯兰教圣地，不过是为了蒙蔽世人的耳目而已。我们警告艾森豪威尔：与其说要关心中近东的伊斯兰教徒，还不如立即在美国停止屠杀黑人的暴行。其实阿拉伯人民已经看穿了美国的阴谋，艾森豪威尔主义至今没有得逞就是证明。并且我们在这些国家听到人们这样谈论着：“我们要求和人民中国增进友谊，要求中国援助，绝不希望美英帝国主义给予好处。”不久以前，我接到阿拉伯各国许多朋友的来信，他们都表示坚决反对帝国主义，决心维护自己国家的主权和民族独立。叙利亚著名的画家、和平战士沙易德·塔合森在信上写着： “亚非人民和全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来，一定能够粉碎帝国主义和它们的帮凶的恶毒计划……。”
    最近英国又准备重新对也门发动一次规模比以前更大的侵犯。如果英帝国主义不接受侵埃战争的失败教训，真的疯狂地发动了战争，我相信我国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民将会如同对埃及人民一样地对正义的也门人民坚决予以全力支持。
    我们体会到，中近东各国人民在万隆会议精神的鼓舞下，为了维护自己民族的独立，摆脱殖民主义的枷锁，反对帝国主义侵略的力量正在日益增长。这是任何力量都阻挡不住的。中近东人民的正义斗争一定会得到最后胜利，殖民主义制度一定会在全世界崩溃。
