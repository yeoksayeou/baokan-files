Title: From Tonics to Classical Literature

　　Walking on the street, one can see advertisements for winter tonics posted at the entrances of many pharmacies. I also thought about buying some tonics to take, but when I asked the doctor, he said, "Your body hasn't fully recovered yet; it's too weak to handle tonics. Taking them will not only be useless but also harmful." Since the doctor said it's not a good idea, I naturally had to abandon the thought.

　　However, I couldn't quite shake it off my mind. I often worry about my health: I want to take tonics but can't because my body is too weak. Ironically, the price of tonics isn't high now, but my body is just too weak. At this time, my high school student repeatedly asked me to help him with his classical literature studies. The child can't be said to be not working hard, but seeing his diligent attitude towards classical literature every day, I'm really worried about his health. I once advised him not to overwork himself, but his answer was, "If I study like this, I'm still at risk of failing, how can I relax?" Looking at his face that is getting thinner day by day, I couldn't help but think about a question: "Why is he in this state? Is it really because he's too stupid?"

　　Thinking about it, I connected my inability to take tonics with his studying of classical literature.

　　Studying classical literature is a good thing. To build new literature, we must build it on the basis of absorbing and carrying forward the excellent literary heritage of the past. But learning classical literature must be done gradually and one shouldn't be too eager for quick success. Weak people shouldn't take tonics. If there is no foundation, can we just force classical literature works on students?

　　Since classical literature began to be taught last semester, both teachers and students have been troubled. For some teachers, this is a new course, and they lack experience. Especially now that there is a severe shortage of teachers, the number of teachers who can teach classical literature is, after all, still "in short supply." As for the students, they mostly read "de ne ma le" before, but now suddenly it's all jingling and jangling classical literature. Moreover, the amount is so much that ordinary high school students can't handle it. Looking at the textbooks selected for high school literature now, it's clear that a lot of effort has been put into the selection and arrangement of materials, but does it fit the actual situation of the students? I'm afraid it's not necessarily so.

　　Let me give an example to illustrate: Our high school literature is scheduled for four hours of instruction per week. The first lesson of the first volume of high school literature, "The Book of Songs," including the special topic and the teaching of six poems, takes five hours. In five hours, students are supposed to understand the special topic, recognize and understand many obscure words, analyze the content, and appreciate the thoughts and feelings expressed in the poems. Has anyone calculated whether the time is enough? Furthermore, looking at the exercises assigned after class, there are seven exercises in total, requiring answering questions about the content of the Book of Songs, understanding the thoughts and feelings of the poems, familiarizing oneself with the special topic, and also memorizing "Shu Li," "Fa Tan," and "Jian Jia." How much time does this require? According to the Ministry of Education's regulations, students shouldn't have an excessive burden, and five hours of class should not exceed three hours of review time. But can three hours complete these seven prescribed exercises? How can students not feel distressed by this?

　　This situation is similar to my inability to take tonics. Classical literature is a good thing, but my child has become pale and haggard. This situation is not only happening to my child, but is widespread throughout the country. In Shanghai, many teachers have reflected this problem, but it has not been taken seriously. Teachers are distressed by the students' distress. Yet our experts who prescribe remedies are prescribing tonics indiscriminately. What can be done when the weak patient can't take it!

　　I am a middle school Chinese teacher. My colleagues and I often talk about this issue and share the same feelings. Last semester, we only received the teaching materials before the start of the semester. After we raised our opinions, we received the teaching materials again before the start of this semester. There is no time to prepare. Students also start learning this course without any preparation. Why isn't there a transition period to allow teachers and students to fully engage in the study of classical literature? If we can understand the actual situation and have a teaching method with a transition period that takes into account the actual situation of teachers and students, perhaps we can avoid this situation?

　　Classical literature should be taught, and I fully support it. But how to proceed needs to be carefully studied. Our students and teachers are groaning. Aren't we going to find a way to calm their spirits?

    从补品想到古典文学
    冯白鲁
    走上街头，可以看到许多药铺门首张贴着冬令补品的广告。我也曾想买些补品吃吃，可是去问问医生，他说：“你的身体还没有完全复原，虚不受补，吃了不仅无益，反而是有害的。”既然医生说不行，自然念头只好打消了。
    可是我的心里却总不能释然于怀。我常常为自己的身体而苦恼：我想补而不能补，现在补品价格不高，可惜自己的身体太不行。偏偏在这个时候，我的读高中的孩子一次又一次来要我帮他学习古典文学。孩子对学习不能说不努力，但看他那种每天为古典文学而兢兢业业的态度，我真为他的健康而担忧。我曾劝过他不要太用功，可是他的回答是：“我这样学习，也有不及格的危险，怎么可以放松呢？”望望他那一天天消瘦下去的面庞，我不禁想起了一个问题：“为什么他会弄到这种田地呢？难道真是他太笨的缘故么？”
    想来想去，我竟把自己不能吃补药的事情与他的学古典文学联系了起来。
    学古典文学是好事情，我们要建立新文学，就必须建立在吸收与发扬古代优秀的文学遗产的基础上。但是学古典文学必须循序渐进，不能急于求功。虚弱的人不宜进补品，如果没有一点基础，是不是就可以把古典文学作品向学生硬塞呢？
    自从上学期开始教授古典文学以来，教师和学生都有苦恼。对某些教师来说，这是一门新的课程，缺乏经验，尤其在师资还十分缺乏的现在，能教古典文学的老师，毕竟还是“供不应求”的。同学们呢，以前大都读的“的呢吗了”，现在一下子都是叮叮＠＠的古典文学，而且分量之多，实在不是一般高中生所能吃得消的。照现在高中文学所选的教材来看，在选材编排上确费过一番苦心，但是不是符合同学们的实际情况呢？只怕是未必的。
    举一个例来说明：我们高中文学规定的授课时数是每周四小时。高中文学第一册的第一课“诗经”，包括专题和六首诗的教授时间是五小时。在五小时内让同学了解专题、认识和理解许多晦涩难懂的词、还要分析内容、体会诗篇所表现的思想感情，时间上够不够计算过没有呢？再从课后所布置的练习来看，习题共有七个，要回答诗经内容、要了解诗的思想感情，又要熟悉专题，更还要背诵“黍离”、
  “伐檀”和“蒹葭”，试问需要多少时间？按照教育部规定：不使学生有过重负担，五小时的课应该不超出三小时的复习时间。但三小时可以完成这样七个规定的练习吗？学生怎么会不因此而感到苦恼呢？
    这情况和我的不能吃补品正有相似之处。古典文学是好东西，但我的孩子却面黄憔悴了。这个情况，不仅出现在我孩子身上，全国范围内都普遍存在这种情况。就上海来说，反映这个问题的教师很多，然而没有被理睬，教师们都为同学的苦恼而苦恼。然而我们处方的专家们猛下补剂，其奈虚弱的病人吃不下何！
    我是一个中学语文教师。和我的同行们常常谈起这个问题，都有同感。我们在上个学期，开学前才拿到教本，提了意见后，这学期又在开学前才拿到教本。准备工作是没时间做的。学生也是没有准备就来接受这样的课程开始学习的。为什么没有一个过渡时期，让教师和学生都能很好地投入古典文学学习呢？如果能了解一下实际情况，针对老师和学生的实际情况，有个过渡时期的教学办法，也许就可以避免这种情形吧？
    古典文学应该教授，我举双手赞成。但怎样进行，须仔细研究。我们的同学老师都在呻吟，还不想法来安安他们的神吗？
