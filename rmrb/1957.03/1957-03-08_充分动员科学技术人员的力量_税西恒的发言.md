I fully endorse Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference. I also fully endorse the reports by Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li, and Vice Chairman Chen at this meeting.

Since the Second Plenary Session of this conference focused on the issues of intellectuals and the march towards science, the Chinese Communist Party has put forward the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" for academic development, and the principle of "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision" in terms of the united front. Over the past year, Chinese intellectuals have made some progress in their ideological understanding, and the leadership work of various scientific, technological, and cultural units has also improved to a certain extent, thus creating many favorable conditions for the work of marching towards science. In general, the work achievements of the past year are significant. Based on my work practice and observations over the past year, I would like to offer some superficial opinions for reference.

Several Issues in Ideological Understanding

Facts have proven over the past few years that the Party's leadership in scientific and technological work is completely correct, and scientific and technical personnel have also contributed some strength under the leadership of the Party. However, in some of the units I have contacted, there are still some problems in the working methods of some cadres and in the ideological understanding of some scientific and technical personnel, which makes the connection between administrative work and scientific and technological work not close enough; the scientific and technological skills of scientific and technical personnel are not well integrated with politics, resulting in the failure to fully exert the administrative and scientific and technological power, thus causing losses. This situation is mainly manifested in the following aspects:

	(1) Because some responsible scientific and technical personnel have a poor ideological understanding and have not done enough to get closer to the organization, they have not been able to participate in the policy and direction work in the unit, and often wait for the leadership's decisions and assignments, accepting and implementing work as purely technical personnel. Although opinions have sometimes been solicited or meetings have been held for discussion, because they usually do not participate in the overall issues of the unit and are not ideologically prepared, they can only make local technical speeches on the work events assigned to them personally during the meeting, and cannot play a role in considering the overall issues of the left-right connection and the upper-lower connection of the event.

	(2) Because some leading cadres have not actively mobilized the relevant responsible scientific and technical personnel and have not fully exerted the role they should play, they sometimes decide on work plans independently by administrative cadres. Because some cadres are not familiar with scientific and technological work, they use purely administrative methods to deal with problems, so some important factors closely related to science and technology have not been introduced into the problem for consideration and research, resulting in the planning and arrangement of some cultural, educational, enterprise, and construction units and the quality of execution being not high enough, and even some falling into a state of insufficient planning, thus suffering from small or large losses.

	(3) In such units, scientific and technical personnel and their work gradually become distant from the administration. Although the relationship is nominally subordinate, it is actually isolated. This ignores the principle of combining politics with professional work. Some administrative leaders first make some arrangements and plans for the work independently and hand them over to various departments to make plans separately. After the plans are completed, they are handed back to the leaders for simple collection. In the two processes of planning and collection, less consideration, analysis, organization, and coordination of scientific and technological nature are carried out; some units even regard scientific and technical personnel as old private doctors, only looking for them for diagnosis and treatment when they are sick, and usually do not allow them to have a more comprehensive understanding and grasp of the actual scientific and technological problems of the unit. As a result, scientific and technical personnel gradually become purely technical personnel who are divorced from reality. This makes the science and technology needed for the country's socialist construction unable to play a practical role and improve from work practice, and makes it difficult for the institutions mastering science and technology to grow soundly.

	(4) Although the general political ideology of scientific and technical personnel has been improved to some extent, some people still do not have enough understanding of the combination of politics and professional work, and do not clearly understand the practical significance of the Party's leadership, confusing the Party's leadership of science and technology policies and guidelines with the management of scientific and technological work of scientific and technical personnel. Some people have not strived for the Party's leadership well in business practice, and some people think that with the Party's leadership, they no longer need to participate in the consideration of the overall work, and are only willing to engage in scientific and technological work. Secondly, because some people have a certain level of science and technology, they do not estimate the collective strength of the masses and the creative power of the working people enough, and often leave the masses alone to do work and deal with problems, and do not pay enough attention to the opinions of the workers and masses, and are not concerned enough about their various suggestions, and do not review and give the necessary help, so that good suggestions are not utilized in time. Defective suggestions have not been corrected, thus causing losses.

From this, it can be seen that although work achievements are the main aspect in our scientific and technological circles, there are still many problems that need to be gradually resolved in order to fully mobilize our country's scientific and technological strength and better serve socialist construction. In this regard, I have some immature opinions below.

Several Opinions on Improving Work

	1. Further strengthen the Party's leadership in science and technology, so that administrative leadership and scientific and technological work are closely linked. At present, all units have increased their leadership strength, developed some new party members, and many party member cadres have responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and actively learned scientific and technological business, which is a strong guarantee for the close connection between administrative and scientific and technological work in the future. However, I feel that the connection between two things must be mutually overreached in order to be close and effective, so the Party's leadership work must be deepened, understand the situation of science and technology, and further strengthen the ideological and organizational leadership of scientific and technical personnel. At the same time, it is necessary to improve the participation of some responsible scientific and technical personnel in some overall work, such as the research and mastery of the policies and guidelines of the unit, and participation in some meetings at the higher level, so that administrative leadership work and scientific and technological expertise can be closely linked to meet the requirements of today's increasingly expanding and refined socialist construction.

	2. Cultivate new forces and improve the old scientific and technical personnel at the same time. At present, all units have actively paid attention to the cultivation of new forces and have achieved results. I feel that the scientific and technical personnel left over from the old China are still a force. They all demand progress under the new situation, and they also have a scientific and technological foundation and more comprehensive work experience, and they are also easy to improve. They can play a certain role in some more comprehensive work and in cultivating new forces. Therefore, it is necessary to further unite and educate the old scientific and technical personnel at present, to improve their ideological level from the theoretical understanding, and to improve their professional level from the practice of scientific and technological work.

	3. Scientific and technical personnel should overcome the tendency to ignore politics, adhere to progress, and after the socialist transformation reached a climax, scientific and technical personnel were greatly encouraged and generally demanded progress. Responding to the call of marching towards science, they have made a lot of efforts in researching science and technology, which is very good. I feel that demanding progress should be combined with life practice in order to achieve better results. At present, while scientific and technical personnel support the socialist construction line and the Party's leadership, there is still a situation of insufficient efforts to strive for the Party's leadership in business practice; while marching towards science, there is also a neglect of realistic production tasks and a lack of peace of mind in administrative work; while advocating a hundred schools of thought contend and opposing dogmatism, there is still a hard copy of the old set or a neglect of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union; after demanding the combination of politics and business for many years, there are still those who are unwilling to participate in the necessary social activities and necessary meetings. All these situations are obstacles to the combination of scientific and technical personnel and politics, which also shows that we must continue to combine work practice to strengthen the realistic significance and necessity of ideological transformation. We scientific and technical personnel hope to make higher demands on ourselves, and under the leadership of the Party, use Marxism-Leninism to illuminate the road forward, continue to transform various non-socialist ideas, and overcome various forms of ideological tendencies that are divorced from politics, in order to fully exert our enthusiasm and contribute the greatest strength to the country's socialist construction.

Please correct the above immature opinions. (Attached picture)

### 充分动员科学技术人员的力量  税西恒的发言

    充分动员科学技术人员的力量
    税西恒的发言
    我完全拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话。我同样完全拥护周总理、李副总理和陈副主席在本会的报告。
    自本会第二次全体会议着重讨论了知识分子问题和向科学进军等问题后，中国共产党对学术发展提出了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策，在统一战线方面提出了“长期共存、互相监督”的方针。一年来，中国知识分子的思想认识有了一定的进步，各种科技文教单位的领导工作也有一定的改善，从而对向科学进军的工作创造了很多有利的条件。总的说来，一年来的工作成绩是显著的。根据我一年来的工作实践和视察见闻，谨反映一点粗浅的意见以供参考。
    思想认识上的几个问题
    党领导科技工作，经几年来事实证明，是完全正确的，同时科技人员在党的领导下，也贡献了一些力量。但是在我所接触的单位在有的干部的工作方法中和在有些科技人员的思想认识中，还存在一些问题，致使行政工作和科学技术工作之间联系不够密切；科技人员的科学技术没有很好的与政治结合，致使行政与科技的力量都没有充分发挥，因而造成损失。这种情况主要表现在以下几方面：
      （一）由于有些负责的科技人员思想认识较差，对靠拢组织的工作做得不够，因而在单位中未能与闻政策方针方面的工作，常是静候领导的决策和分派，以纯技术人员的身份来接受和奉行工作。虽然有时曾经过征求意见或开会讨论，但由于他们平时没有与闻本单位的整体问题，思想准备不够，开会时除对个人派定的工作事件，从技术上作局部发言外，对事件的左右联系和上下承系的一些整体性的问题的考虑都无法发挥作用。
      （二）由于有的领导干部没有积极动员有关负责的科技人员，没有充分发挥他们应起的作用，有时就单独由行政干部来决定工作计划，由于有的干部对科技工作不够熟悉，就用单纯的行政方法处理问题，致有些和科学技术有密切关系的重要因素都没有被引入问题内部来考虑和研究，以致有的文教、企业和建设单位的规划安排和执行工作的质量都做得不够高，甚至有的陷于计划性不够的状态，因而受到或大或小的损失。
      （三）在这样的单位中，科学技术的人员和他们的工作都逐渐与行政有了距离，名义虽然是从属的关系，但实际上是被孤立起来了。这就忽视了政治与业务相结合的原则。有的行政领导首先单独对工作作出某种安排和规划交与各个部门分别做成计划，计划成后再交回领导简单地汇集起来，在规划和汇集的两次工作中较少经过科技性质的考虑、分析、组织和配合；甚至有的单位视科技人员如同旧的开业医生，有病才找他们诊治，平时没有使他们较为全面地了解和掌握本单位科技的实际问题。因而科技人员也就逐渐变成了脱离实际的纯技术人员。这样就使得国家的社会主义建设所需要的科学技术不能发挥现实作用和从工作实践中获到提高，并且使得掌握科技的机构不容易健全地成长起来。
      （四）科技人员的一般政治思想虽有所提高，但有的人对政治与业务结合方面的认识还不够，没有明确党的领导的实际意义，把党对科技的政策方针的领导与科技人员的科技工作的管理混同起来。有的人在业务实践上没有很好的争取党的领导，有的人又认为有了党的领导，自己就不必再参加整体工作的考虑，裨得专搞科技工作。其次有些人由于自己有了一定的科技水平，对群众的集体力量和劳动人民的创造力量估计不够，常丢开群众力量孤立起来搞工作，处理问题，没有很好地重视工人群众的意见，并且对他们的种种建议不够关心，没有很好地审查和加以应有的帮助，使得好的建议没有及时得到利用。有缺点的建议没有得到改正，因而造成损失。
    由此可见，在我们科学技术界，虽然工作成绩是主要的，但是存在的问题还是不少，需要逐步解决，才能充分动员我国科技力量，很好地为社会主义建设服务。在这一方面我有下面一些不成熟的意见。
    改进工作的几点意见
    一、进一步加强党对科技的领导，使得行政领导与科技工作密切联系起来。目前各单位都已增加领导力量，发展一些新党员，并且有不少党员干部响应党中央的号召，积极学习科技业务，这是行政与科技工作密切联系未来的有力保证。但是我觉得两件事物的联系必须是互相超过头的，才能密切有效，所以党的领导工作还要深入下去，了解科技的情况，进一步加强对科技人员的思想领导与组织领导，要同时提高某些负责的科技人员参与一些整体工作，如本单位的政策方针的研究和掌握，参加上一级的某些会议等，使得行政领导工作与科技专业取得密切的联系，以适应今天日益扩大和精细的社会主义建设的要求。
    二、培养新生力量，同时提高老的科技人员。目前各单位对新生力量的培养都已积极注意，并已取得成绩，我觉得旧中国遗留下来的科技人员还是一支力量，他们在新形势下都要求进步，而且有了科技基础和较全面的工作经验，也容易提高，他们在某些较全面的工作和在培养新生力量等方面都可以发挥一定的作用。所以目前对老科技人员需要更加团结教育，要从理论认识上提高他们的思想水平，并从科技的工作实践上提高他们的业务水平。
    三、科技人员要克服忽视政治的倾向，坚持进步，在社会主义改造达到高潮后，科技人员受到了很大的鼓舞，普遍要求进步。响应向科学进军的号召，在研究科技方面作了不少的努力，这是很好的。我觉得要求进步应该同生活实践结合起来才有更好的成绩。目前科技人员在拥护社会主义建设路线和党领导的同时还有在业务实践上争取党的领导不够的情况；在向科学进军的同时还有忽视现实生产任务和不安心于行政工作的；在提倡百家争鸣和反教条主义的同时，还有硬搬老一套或忽视苏联先进经验的；要求政治结合业务多年，还有不愿意参加应有的社会活动和必要的会议的。所有这些情况，都是科技人员与政治结合的碍障，也就说明了我们必须继续结合工作实践来加强思想改造的现实意义和必要性。我们科技人员对自己，希望提出更高的要求，要在党的领导下用马克思列宁主义照耀前进的道路，继续改造各种非社会主义的思想，克服各种形式的脱离政治的思想倾向，才能充分发挥积极性为国家的社会主义建设贡献出最大的力量。
    以上这些不成熟的意见，敬请各位指正。（附图片）
