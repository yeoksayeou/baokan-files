Exchange Reclamation Experience, Strive for Greater Harvest
Soviet Reclamation Youth Congress Opens

    This newspaper's Moscow dispatch, March 1st. The All-Union Third Congress of Outstanding Komsomol Members and Youth in Land Reclamation opened at 10:00 a.m. on February 28th in the Kremlin. The opening of the congress was presided over by Shelepin, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Komsomol. Twelve hundred outstanding reclamation workers from all over the Soviet Union filled the conference hall. This meeting will summarize and exchange advanced experiences in land reclamation over the past three years, and strive for a greater harvest on the newly reclaimed land this year.
    The Chinese youth delegation headed by Hu Ke Shi, as well as youth delegations from North Korea, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, East Germany, and other countries, were also invited to participate in the congress.
    At the meeting, Soviet Minister of Agriculture Matskevich, Minister of Agriculture of the Russian Federal Republic Maloziv, and others delivered reports. They unanimously pointed out that great achievements have been made in land reclamation over the past three years. Three hundred and fifty thousand Soviet youths responded to the Party's call and came to the wastelands of Kazakhstan, Siberia, and other places. Three thousand five hundred and fifty million hectares of new land have been reclaimed. The Soviet Union achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in 1956, which is inseparable from the large-scale reclamation of new land. The Soviet Party and government have given high praise to the heroic labor of young reclamation workers. Six hundred and sixty-two reclamation workers have been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor. More than 90,000 agricultural workers have received medals and awards.
    The reports pointed out that on the basis of the victories already achieved in land reclamation, 4 to 5 million hectares of newly reclaimed land will be expanded in 1957, and it will be guaranteed that unit area yield will be increased and losses during harvesting will be reduced on the basis of fully utilizing advanced cultivation and harvesting technologies.

    交流开荒经验  争取更大丰收
    苏联垦荒青年代表大会开幕
    本报莫斯科1日电  全苏第三次开垦荒地优秀共青团员和青年代表大会2月28日上午十点在克里姆林宫开幕。苏联共青团中央委员会第一书记谢列平主持大会开幕。来自全苏各地的一千二百名优秀开荒者坐满了会议大厅。这次会议将总结和交流三年来开垦荒地的先进经验，争取今年新垦地上更大丰收。
    以胡克实为首的中国青年代表团以及朝鲜、波兰、捷克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚、民主德国等各国青年代表团也应邀参加大会。
    会上苏联农业部部长马茨凯维奇、俄罗斯联邦共和国农业部部长马洛齐夫等作了报告。他们一致指出，三年来开垦荒地已取得了巨大成就。三十五万苏联青年响应党的号召来到了哈萨克斯坦、西伯利亚等荒地。开垦新地达三千五百五十万公顷。1956年苏联获得了历史上空前的大丰收，这是与大量开垦新地分不开的。苏联党和政府对青年开垦者的英勇劳动给予了很高评价。六百六十二个开垦者已荣获了社会主义劳动英雄称号。九万多农业劳动者获得了勋章和奖章。
    报告指出，在开荒已取得的胜利基础上，1957年将扩大新开垦荒地四百到五百万公顷。并保证在充分利用先进耕作和收获的技术基础上，增加单位面积产量和减少收获时的损失量。
