At a recent conference of advanced production representatives of highway survey teams held in Chongqing, the reporter interviewed representatives of China's first women's survey team on the highway front. This women's survey team brilliantly completed the survey task for the Simao to Jiangcheng highway in Yunnan in their first battle. They are one of the two survey teams among the eleven survey teams of the First Branch of the Highway Survey and Design Institute of the Ministry of Communications whose field data was rated as "Excellent."

This women's survey team, established last year on "August 1st," was sent to the Yunnan border area to survey the Simao to Jiangcheng highway. This area is a true tropical region south of the Tropic of Cancer. There are no spring, summer, autumn, or winter here, only dry and wet seasons. On sunny days, even in the dead of winter, wearing short sleeves and living in tents, it is still stifling and makes people dizzy. The mountains in this area are covered with lush forests all year round, and the thatch on the mountains is thicker than a thumb and taller than a person.

Last October, when this women's survey team crossed the upper reaches of the Luosuo River—the Manlao River—and arrived at the foot of Yingpan Mountain, the most dangerous mountain on the Simao-Jiangcheng highway line, the tropical rainy season had not yet passed. They pressed down the thatch, set up tents, put on cloth socks to protect against leeches, and strapped iron crampons to their feet to prevent slipping, and then began to work. In the morning, the fog and dew were heavy, and their clothes were always wet. They had to climb over a large mountain to go to work and return from work, and every night they came back covered in mud. A female team member nicknamed "Little Yak," served as the leader of the center line staking team from Simao to Jiangcheng, working in the field. She ignored the tropical sun, which was like a blazing fire, and spent all day drilling through the dense thatch. The thatch, when it touched her sweaty skin, felt like a knife cut. After work in the evening, she often worked alone until late at night. Wang Jingfen, who loved to cry and laugh, was called Xiao Wang by everyone, and was afraid of snakes and leeches, which are very common in the tropics. On her first day of work, she accidentally disturbed a large nest of bees, which stung her head and face, causing them to swell. But she loved fieldwork and was unwilling to go back to do indoor work. Zeng Huafang, whose body did not look very strong, also found it strange: working in the field during the tropical rainy season, her clothes were wet and then dry, and then wet again, several times a day, but she never got sick once. They have gradually been trained to become strong fighters on the highway front in the work of building the border areas of the motherland.

These strong fighters on the highway front are mostly young women in their twenties. Some come from the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian, some come from the white mountains and black waters of the Northeast, some come from the North China Plain, and there are also many innocent and lively Sichuan girls. They have been working for only two or three years since leaving school, but their footprints have almost covered the plateaus, snow-capped mountains, river valleys, and great rivers of the Southwest. Some have surveyed the Kangzang Highway built on the roof of the world, and some have surveyed the Yixi Highway that runs through the Greater and Lesser Liang Mountains.

When these young women first formed the survey team, their technical level was not high. Twenty-two female youths who graduated from secondary technical schools and junior high schools undertook the technical work of the entire team, and there were also four experienced technicians who served as technical instructors. However, from the day it was established, the women's survey team was eager to become a vital force capable of working independently. The leader of the team's internal affairs group was supposed to assist the captain in guiding and arranging the work of the entire team, and was originally to be held by technicians and engineers who graduated from universities or colleges. However, after 21-year-old Lü Jinyuan took over as the leader of the internal affairs group, with the help of instructors, she was able to work independently after several months of hard work. Zhang Derong, the leader of the leveling group, and Zeng Huafang, the leader of the topographic profile group, who originally needed the instructors' guidance, were also able to work independently soon. Now, the four instructors of the women's survey team have been transferred to other jobs. Due to the improvement of the technical level of all team members, the average time to measure one kilometer has been reduced from ten hours at the beginning to less than four hours, and the survey data of the Sijiang Line has also been rated as "Excellent" after acceptance.

### 我国第一个女子公路测量队

    我国第一个女子公路测量队
    新华社记者  王华东
    在重庆最近召开的一个公路勘测队的先进生产者代表会议上，记者访问了我国公路战线上第一个女子测量队的代表。这个女子测量队第一仗便出色地完成了云南思茅到江城公路的测量任务。她们是交通部公路勘测设计院第一分院十一个测量队中野外资料被评为“优良”级的两个测量队之一。
    这个女子测量队在去年“八一”成立后，被派到云南边疆测量思茅到江城公路。这一带是北回归线以南的真正热带地区。这里没有春、夏、秋、冬，只有干、湿二季。出太阳的日子，就是在寒冬腊月，穿着短袖衣衫，住在篷帐里，还是会闷热得使人头昏。这一带的山上，一年四季都长着青葱的林木，山上的茅草比大拇指还粗，比人还高。
    去年10月，当这支女子测量队渡过罗梭江上游——曼老河，来到思茅江城公路线上最险峻的大山——营盘山下时，热带的雨季还没有过去。她们按倒茅草，搭起篷帐，穿起防御蚂蟥的布袜，脚板上绑起了防滑的铁制的脚马，便开始工作。早上雾大、露大，衣服总是湿的。出工、收工都要翻越一座大山，每晚都带着一身稀泥巴回来。一位外号叫“小牦牛”的女队员，从思茅到江城，一直担任中线定桩组组长，在野外工作。她不顾热带烈火一样的太阳，整天在密不通风的茅草丛里钻，茅草碰到汗淋淋的皮肤上，像刀割一样。晚上收工后，她又常常一个人工作到深夜。爱哭、爱笑的王景芬，大家都叫她小王，见到在热带地区很平常的蛇和蚂蟥都害怕。初次出工，便在无意中触犯了一大窝蜂，螫得她头大面肿。但她热爱野外工作，不愿意回去做内业工作。身体看起来不很强壮的曾华芳，她自己也觉得奇怪：热带雨季在野外工作，衣服湿了又干，干了又湿，一天总有好几回，却一次病也没有生过。她们在建设祖国边疆的工作中已逐渐锻炼成为公路战线上的坚强战士。
    这些公路战线上的坚强战士，其实大部分是二十多岁的年轻姑娘。她们有的来自东南海滨的浙江、福建，有的来自白山黑水之间，有的来自华北大平原，也有不少天真活泼的四川姑娘。她们离开学校参加工作到现在不过两、三年，但她们的足迹差不多已经走遍了西南的高原、雪山、河谷、大川。有的测量过筑在世界屋脊上的康藏公路，有的测量过横贯大小凉山的宜西公路。
    这些年轻的姑娘刚组成测量队的时候，技术水平并不高。二十二个中等技术学校和初中毕业的女青年担任了全队的技术工作，另外有四个有经验的技术员担任技术上的辅导员。但是女子测量队从成立那天起，便渴望成为一支能够独立工作的生力军。测量队的内业组组长要协助队长指导和安排全队的工作，本来要由大学或专科学校毕业的技术员和工程师担任。可是二十一岁的吕巾元担任内业组组长后，在辅导员的帮助下，经过几个月的努力，就已经能够独立工作了。原来需要辅导员辅导的水平组组长张德蓉和地形断面组组长曾华芳等，也都很快能够独立工作。现在，女子测量队的四个辅导员已被调到其他工作岗位上去工作。由于全体队员的技术水平提高了，现在平均测一公里的时间已由开始时的十小时减少到了不到四小时，思江线的测量资料经过验收也被评为“优良”级。
