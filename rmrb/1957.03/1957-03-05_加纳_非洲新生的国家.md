Ghana—A Newborn Nation in Africa
Tan Ruojun

March 6th will mark the birth of a new nation in West Africa—Ghana. “Ghana” was once the name of a glorious ancient kingdom established by the African people in the Middle Ages. Its reappearance as an independent black nation in the world represents another great victory for the African people in their struggle against colonialism.

The territory of Ghana includes the former British "Gold Coast Colony," the British protectorates of "Ashanti" and the "Northern Territories," and the British-administered area of Togoland will also join Ghana. Its total area is 237,870 square kilometers, with a population of 4,620,000 (1955 statistics).

The people of Ghana have suffered nearly five centuries of devastation by colonial powers, and they have waged countless arduous struggles against colonialism.

As early as the mid-15th century, the clutches of colonialism extended to the west coast of Africa. In 1482, the Gold Coast became a colony of Portugal. Subsequently, the colonial forces of the Netherlands and Britain also came to this rich land to plunder gold, ivory, and engage in the "black slave" trade. In the 1630s, the Netherlands replaced Portugal in the colonial rule of the Gold Coast. From 1664 to 1665, Britain and the Netherlands fought for the colony on the Gold Coast, and Britain was defeated. Later, British colonial forces gained the upper hand, and by 1821, Britain had monopolized the Gold Coast. Since World War II, American monopoly capital has also continued to encroach.

The influence of the colonialists was initially limited to the coastal areas of the Gulf of Guinea. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the inland areas of "Ashanti" and the "Northern Territories" successively became British protectorates. Beginning in 1922, the British-administered area of the Togoland trust territory was also placed under the administration of the Gold Coast. Due to the long-term plunder by the colonialists, the rich Ghana is still a backward and singular agricultural country. The main crop, cocoa, is known as "green gold." In 1954, the annual output was 220,000 tons, accounting for one-half of the world's total production, ranking first in the world. British monopoly capital monopolizes the planting and sales of cocoa in the Gold Coast through the "Gold Coast Cocoa Marketing Board." In recent years, Britain has used the export of cocoa from the Gold Coast to earn US dollars. These US dollars have all been remitted to London's pound accounts, which now amount to 213 million pounds. However, the Gold Coast government cannot use them casually.

The Gold Coast also produces rubber, coconuts, palm, bananas, etc., which are also the objects of plunder by the colonialists. Of the 2,500 acres of rubber plantations, Europeans control 2,000 acres.

Ghana has rich mineral deposits. The name "Gold Coast" comes from its gold production. In 1950, Britain shipped away gold worth 8,719,000 pounds from the Gold Coast. In 1954, the annual gold production was 24,481 kilograms, ranking second in Africa and sixth in the world. In addition, the Gold Coast also produces diamonds, manganese ore, and bauxite. The annual diamond production in 1953 was 2,190,000 carats. In 1951, the output of manganese ore was 800,000 tons (manganese content), ranking third in the world. However, these resources have long been controlled by foreign monopoly capital. The British "United Africa Company" controls the main mining industry in the Gold Coast. Manganese ore is controlled by the "Minerals and Carbon Union Consortium" formed by American capital. Since 1951, British and American monopoly capital have been planning to expand the exploitation of bauxite in the Gold Coast. According to recent reports, the World Bank is planning to invest 600 million US dollars to build a huge dam, power station, and aluminum smelter on the Volta River, attempting to plunder the bauxite of the Gold Coast.

Under colonial rule, the rich resources and products of the Gold Coast in the past only brought huge profits to foreign monopoly capital, while the local people lived in poverty. The income of workers in the Gold Coast is only one-twentieth of that of British workers. The mortality rate of children is very high, with a statistic of 11.7% in 1951.

The people of Ghana, like the people of all African countries, are people who love freedom and refuse to submit. For centuries, colonialists have been stubbornly resisted by the people of Ghana, and riots have occurred frequently. In the 1930s, the struggle of the people of the Gold Coast against colonialism formed a broad national independence movement. From 1937 to 1938, they massively intercepted cocoa, opposing British plunder. In 1937, the first trade union in the Gold Coast—the Motor Drivers Union—was established. A national newspaper also appeared during the same period. During World War II, the national independence movement developed greatly. In August 1947, some senior intellectuals, in the struggle against British colonial rule, formed the first political organization—the United Gold Coast Convention, demanding the rapid implementation of self-government. This demand was widely supported by the masses of people across the country.

In 1948, the national independence movement entered a new stage. A demonstration led by veterans broke out in the capital, Accra, in February, resisting colonial rule. The British colonial authorities opened fire on the demonstrators, causing a bloody tragedy. This event aroused the anger of the people across the country, who rose up and attacked prisons, police stations, warehouses, and colonial shops. The riot continued for a month.

In June 1949, some members of the United Gold Coast Convention formed the "People's Convention Party" to continue leading the people in resisting British colonial rule. On January 9, 1950, under the leadership of the "People's Convention Party," a three-day nationwide general strike of "non-violence" was launched to boycott British goods, oppose the anti-democratic constitution promulgated by Britain, and demand immediate self-governance. Later, the struggle became increasingly fierce.

In order to ease the resistance of the people, the British colonial authorities had to make some concessions. In 1946, 1951, and 1954, the British colonial authorities successively promulgated three constitutions, and were forced to gradually give the local people certain rights. In February 1951, the Gold Coast held its first election, and for the first time a black man served as prime minister and formed a semi-autonomous government. According to the constitution amended in April 1954, the Legislative Assembly and the Cabinet were entirely composed of Africans.

However, the 1954 constitution still did not grant the Gold Coast full autonomy. The people are still dissatisfied with it. They demand that all legislative, administrative, and judicial positions be held by Africans, and that full autonomy be achieved. On September 18, 1956, Britain was forced to announce that it would grant the Gold Coast independence within the British Commonwealth on March 6, 1957.

On February 8th of this year, the British government published the proposed Ghana constitution in the form of a white paper. The constitution stipulates that Ghana is an independent country within the British Commonwealth, with the British Queen as the head of state, and the Governor-General exercising the functions of the British Queen. Ministers are appointed or removed by the Governor-General on the advice of the Prime Minister. The highest legislative power belongs to the Parliament. The National Assembly includes the Speaker and one hundred and four members elected by direct election for a term of five years. Regional councils are established in each region. The powers, duties and functions of each regional council are prescribed by law passed by Parliament. The Constitution guarantees the position of Chiefs in accordance with existing customary laws and practices.

On March 6th, the people of Ghana will celebrate this historic day with joy and excitement. The Chinese people sincerely extend warm congratulations to the people of Ghana.

    加纳—非洲新生的国家
    谭若君
    3月6日，非洲西部将诞生一个新的国家——加纳。“加纳”曾是非洲人民在中世纪建立的一个光辉古国的名字。它重新代表着一个独立的黑人国家出现于世界，这是非洲人民反殖民主义斗争中的又一伟大的胜利。
    加纳的国土包括原来的英属“黄金海岸殖民地”、英国保护国“亚山蒂”和“北部领土”，多哥的英国托管区也将加入加纳。它的总面积为二十三万七千八百七十平方公里，人口四百六十二万（1955年统计）。
    加纳人民曾经遭受殖民国家将近五百年的蹂躏，他们同殖民主义者进行了无数艰苦的斗争。
    早在十五世纪中叶，殖民主义者的魔爪就伸到了非洲的西海岸。1482年，黄金海岸沦为葡萄牙的殖民地。随后荷兰和英国的殖民势力也来到了这块富饶的土地，从事掠夺黄金、象牙和贩卖“黑奴”。十七世纪三十年代，荷兰取代了葡萄牙对黄金海岸的殖民统治。1664年至1665年间，英荷两国在黄金海岸曾爆发争夺殖民地的战争，英国战败。以后英国殖民势力又占上风，到1821年，英国独占了黄金海岸。第二次世界大战以来，美国垄断资本也不断侵入。
    殖民主义者的势力起初只限于畿内亚湾的沿海地区，十九世纪末和本世纪初，内部地区的“亚山蒂”和“北部领土”先后沦为英国保护国。1922年开始，多哥托管地的英托管区。在行政上也划归黄金海岸管理。由于殖民者的长期掠夺，富饶的加纳现在仍是一个落后的单一性农业国。主要农作物可可，有“绿色黄金”之称。1954年年产量为二十二万吨，占世界总产量的二分之一，居世界第一位。英国垄断资本通过“黄金海岸可可销售局”垄断了黄金海岸可可的种植和销售。近几年来，英国利用黄金海岸可可的出口，换取美元。这些美元，都被汇到伦敦的英镑帐目上，到现在已达二亿一千三百万英镑。可是黄金海岸政府不得随便动用。
    黄金海岸还出产橡胶、椰子、棕榈、香蕉等。也是殖民者掠夺的对象。在二千五百英亩橡胶园中，欧洲人就控制了二千英亩。
    加纳有丰富的矿藏。“黄金海岸”的得名就因产金而来。1950年，英国从黄金海岸运走了价值八百七十一万九千英镑的黄金。1954年，黄金的年产量为二万四千四百八十一公斤，占非洲第二位，世界第六位。此外，黄金海岸还出产钻石、锰矿和铁矾土等。钻石的年产量，1953年为二百一十九万克拉。1951年锰矿砂的产量为八十万吨 （含锰量），占世界第三位。可是，这些资源长期以来都为外国垄断资本所控制。英国的“联合非洲公司”控制了黄金海岸主要的采矿业。锰矿则为美国资本所组成的“矿化物与碳联合康采恩”所控制。1951年以来，英美垄断资本计划着在黄金海岸扩大铁矾土的开采。据最近报道，世界银行正在计划投资六亿美元，在伏尔达河上修建一个巨型的水坝、发电站和炼铝厂，企图掠夺黄金海岸的铁矾土。
    在殖民者统治下，黄金海岸富饶的资源和物产过去只是给外国垄断资本带来巨额利润，当地人民却过着穷困的生活。黄金海岸工人的收入只等于英国工人收入的二十分之一。儿童的死亡率很高，据1951年的统计为11.7％。
    加纳人民像非洲各国人民一样，是热爱自由、不甘屈服的人民。数世纪以来，殖民主义者一直遭到了加纳人民的顽强反抗，经常发生暴动。到了二十世纪三十年代，黄金海岸人民反抗殖民主义的斗争形成了广泛的民族独立运动。1937年至1938年间，他们大规模地拦劫可可，反对英国的掠夺。1937年，黄金海岸成立了第一个工会——汽车司机工会。同一时期也出现了一家民族报纸。二次大战期间，民族独立运动又有了很大的发展。1947年
  8月，一部分高级知识分子在反对英国殖民主义统治的斗争中，组成了第一个政治组织——黄金海岸统一会议，要求尽快地实行自治。这一要求受到全国人民群众广泛的支持。
    1948年，民族独立运动进入了一个新的阶段。首都阿克拉在2月爆发了以退伍军人为首的示威运动，反抗殖民统治，英国殖民当局对示威群众开枪射击，造成流血惨案。这一事件激起了全国人民的愤怒，他们起而袭击了监狱、警察局、仓库和殖民者的商店。暴动继续了一月之久。
    1949年6月，黄金海岸统一会议中一部分人另成立了“人民大会党”，继续领导人民反抗英国的殖民统治。1950年1月9日，在“人民大会党”的领导下，发动了“非暴动”的、为时三天的全国大罢工，以抵制英货，反对英国颁布的反民主的宪法，要求立即取得自治的地位。以后，斗争愈来愈强烈。
    英国殖民当局为了缓和人民的反抗，不能不作出某些让步。在1946年、1951年和1954年，英国殖民当局先后颁布了三次宪法，被迫逐步给当地人民以某些权利。1951年2月，黄金海岸举行了第一次选举，第一次由黑人担任总理，组成了一个半自治的政府。根据1954年
  4月修改后的宪法，立法议会和内阁，全部由非洲人组成。
    但1954年的宪法，仍然没有使黄金海岸取得完全的自治。人民对它仍然不满。他们要求把所有立法的、行政的和司法的职位全部由非洲人担任，实现完全的自治。1956年9月18日，英国被迫宣布在1957年3月6日给黄金海岸以在英联邦之内的独立。
    今年2月8日，英国政府以白皮书的形式发表了拟议中的加纳宪法。这个宪法规定：加纳是英联邦内的一个独立国家，以英女王为国家元首，总督代行英女王的职权。部长由总督根据总理的意见任命或撤换。最高立法权属于国会。国民议会包括议长和由直接选举产生的一百零四席议员，任期五年。每一地区设立区域议会。每一地区议会的权力、职责和权能根据议会所通过的法律加以规定。宪法根据现有的习惯法和惯例，保证酋长的职位。
    3月6日，加纳人民将以欢欣鼓舞的心情庆祝这个具有历史意义的日子，中国人民衷心地向加纳人民致以热烈的祝贺。
