Since last summer, there has been much discussion about promoting agricultural production increase measures. How we should understand and approach the agricultural production increase measures taken in various regions last year is closely related to whether these measures can continue to be implemented. From what I have heard, most people have adopted an attitude of affirming the achievements and criticizing the shortcomings; however, some people have continued to voice various unfavorable opinions and made excessive accusations. This latter attitude will affect the enthusiasm of cadres and farmers to improve production and hinder the implementation of agricultural technology measures for increasing production in the future. Therefore, it is essential to clarify the achievements and basic experiences and lessons of promoting agricultural production increase technology measures in 1956.

	The Promotion of Agricultural Production Increase Measures Had Significant Effects Last Year

Checking from the actual effect of agricultural production increase, the achievements of promoting production increase measures in various parts of the country in 1956 were huge. The result of promoting agricultural production increase technology measures, according to many survey materials from various regions, is that more than 80% increased production; about 15% had shortcomings in their work but did not reduce production; at most about 5% actually made mistakes and reduced output. As a result of expanding double-cropping rice and converting dry land into paddy fields in 1956, the rice planting area expanded by 55 million mu; although late rice production in Hunan and other provinces decreased due to drought, the increase in rice production last year still reached more than 12 billion jin. In the expansion of high-yield crops, the planting of corn increased by more than 48 million mu, and potatoes and sweet potatoes increased by more than 13 million mu, all of which achieved significant increases in production; according to Shandong Province's estimates, the province increased the planting of high-yield crops by more than 9 million mu, increasing production by about 3 billion jin. The large number of water conservancy projects built increased the irrigated area by more than 160 million mu in terms of project benefits, and improved the irrigated area by more than 70 million mu. It is estimated that, excluding those damaged by floods, unfinished projects, and those of poor quality, the actual irrigated area can be expanded by more than 100 million mu. The work of accumulating fertilizer, according to statistics from thirteen provinces, is generally one to two times that of normal years. More than one million double-wheel double-铧 plows and other new farm tools were promoted, most of which played a good role. Great achievements have been made in the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, improvement of cultivation techniques, soil and water conservation, and soil improvement. It should be said that without national collectivization, these measures could not have been promoted on such a large scale; without these effective agricultural production increase technology measures, the achievement of a considerable increase in production despite severe disasters could not have been achieved even with collectivization.

	Do Not Draw Conclusions About the Overall Work Based on Temporary and Isolated Situations

It is difficult for any major work to be completely smooth sailing, with only achievements and no shortcomings; on the contrary, the success of many things is achieved after accepting the experience of failure. The promotion of agricultural production increase measures is no exception. Shortcomings should be criticized and corrected; but we must see the overall picture, distinguish between the main and the secondary, affirm the achievements, and criticize the shortcomings. Some people do not observe the problem comprehensively, seize on isolated instances of failure, criticize and accuse them, and draw harmful conclusions. There are many examples of this. For example, the Yin Fang rice promoted in Sichuan looked worse than local varieties during the growing season; at that time, some commune members were afraid of reduced harvests and had many opinions. Some people said: "The promoters are bad matchmakers, marrying a Yin Fang girl to Sichuan people, harming the Sichuan people." Some cadres only spoke of the bad side, writing letters to the government and contributing to newspapers, causing panic for a while. When the autumn harvest came, Yin Fang rice increased production, and the facts overcame the confusion and stabilized the mood. When Hubei and Hunan promoted the "Aomori No. 5" rice variety, because the method of planting this rice in the south was not well understood, some of it grew abnormally, or grew poorly, and the harvest was low; but whether the "Aomori No. 5" rice variety cannot be planted in Hubei and Hunan at all remains to be confirmed by scientific experiments and multiple trials. This kind of thing is originally unavoidable in new things. However, it has also been subjected to excessive criticism and accusations, hurting the emotions of cadres and farmers. Judging from these examples encountered in the promotion of agricultural production increase technology measures last year, this should be taken as a basic lesson.

	We Must Constantly Support Advanced Thinking and Overcome Backward Thinking

The struggle between advanced and backward thinking is constantly present in agricultural cooperatives, and advanced, intermediate, and backward states exist among the masses at all times. The promotion of advanced agricultural production increase technology measures is always led and supported by activists, driving the majority of farmers forward, and it will also inevitably encounter obstacles and resistance from backward thinking. If these measures achieve significant production increase effects after their implementation, the enthusiasm of the masses will be high, and backward thinking will be overcome. However, there are often many measures that succeed, and some that are not done well, or fail; or a certain measure is basically successful, but some shortcomings or even errors are produced. In this case, conservatives get "evidence" and resist, the intermediate masses waver, and the enthusiasm of activists fluctuates. In this situation, if the leadership cannot affirm the achievements, criticize the shortcomings, and help correct them in time, it will lead to a complete negation and damage the work. Taking the promotion of Baima Ya corn in Quyang County, Hebei Province last year as an example, when local corn had already flowered and tasseled, Baima Ya corn was still developing stalks and leaves due to its longer growing period. The masses were afraid that it would only grow stalks and not tassel, their thinking wavered, and those who originally opposed it reported to Beijing, and the People's Daily and Hebei Daily also published readers' criticisms. However, the result of the autumn harvest was that Baima Ya corn generally produced seventy or eighty jin more than local corn. If it had not been persisted at that time, wouldn't it have caused great losses? Therefore, in the promotion of agricultural production increase technology measures, constantly supporting the advanced and constantly overcoming the backward should be a very important experience.

	We Must Combine Long-Term Interests with Current Interests

Some production increase measures require investment in the current year and can only benefit in two or several years, or the benefit in the current year is very small and large benefits can only be obtained later, such as building water conservancy projects, improving soil, soil and water conservation, afforestation, breeding draft animals, raising young livestock, and so on. For long-term benefits, these measures must be carried out according to the financial and labor conditions of the agricultural production cooperatives, planned year by year, and constantly increasing production. This principle is originally very simple. However, often some commune members only care about the income of the current year and are unwilling to engage in these measures; even if they do, there are those who complain about the leading cadres and activists because the benefits are small in the current year, they do not receive remuneration, or they receive very little remuneration. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly carry out education combining long-term interests with current interests, neither being greedy for more and bigger, regardless of actual investment capacity, hindering the increase in income and improvement in the lives of commune members, and also taking care of long-term interests and carrying them out in a planned way. This should also be a basic experience.

	Protect Enthusiasm, Overcome Blindness

Last year, some people overestimated the favorable factors brought about by the high tide of collectivization, and they did not pay enough attention to the fact that various production increase technology measures must be adapted to local conditions and the time, so they demanded too much and sought success too quickly. For example, the promotion plan for double-wheel double-铧 plows was set too large, and they were promoted on a large scale in areas that were not suitable for use, based solely on individual experiments. In the promotion of improved varieties, although some varieties were originally very good, they were not tested in the newly promoted areas, or only a few tests were done, and the growth characteristics and cultivation methods of the varieties were not yet clear, so they were promoted on a large area, resulting in poor growth and reduced production. Although these shortcomings and errors are unavoidable in the work, they should be strictly checked and lessons learned. As long as there are mistakes, we should humbly admit them and earnestly correct them. Some of these errors were caused by grassroots cadres mechanically implementing the regulations of the higher authorities, and some cadres even adopted coercive methods. Of course, they are wrong; however, their starting point is good, it is for production increase, and it is to respond to the call of the higher authorities. For these cadres, we must first protect their enthusiasm, and at the same time help them to correct their mistakes realistically. Some errors are caused by higher-level leading organs, and the higher-level leading departments should bear the responsibility and earnestly overcome subjectivism and bureaucratism. As for individual bad cadres who have very bad ideas and repeatedly violate laws and disciplines and refuse to be reformed, they should of course be subject to due disciplinary sanctions.

To strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year, there must be active and effective measures. We should seriously summarize last year's experiences. All those that have succeeded should continue to be vigorously promoted; all those that have gone wrong should find out the causes of the errors and accept the lessons of failure; and those that cannot be concluded for the time being should be further tested on a small scale.

　　吸取去年的经验更好地推行农业增产措施
　　益农
    从去年夏天以来，对于推行农业增产措施，出现了很多议论。对于去年各地采取的农业增产措施究竟应该如何认识，采取什么态度，密切关系到这些措施能否继续推行。据我所听到的，多数人采取了肯定成绩、批评缺点的态度；但是也有人不断发出种种不利的言论，提出了过多的指责。这后一种态度会影响干部和农民群众改进生产的积极性，阻碍今后农业增产技术措施的贯彻执行。因此，把1956年推行农业增产技术措施的成就和基本经验教训搞清楚，是十分必要的。
            去年推行农业增产措施有巨大的效果
    从农业增产的实际效果来检查，1956年全国各地推行增产措施的成绩是巨大的。推广农业增产技术措施的结果，根据各地许多调查材料来估计，80％以上是增产的；有15％左右工作中有缺点但并未减产；真正造成错误、减少产量的至多不过5％左右。1956年扩大双季稻、旱地改稻田的结果，水稻种植面积扩大了五千五百万亩；虽然湖南等省晚稻因旱减产，去年的稻谷增产仍达一百二十多亿斤。在扩大高产作物中，增种玉米四千八百多万亩，薯类一千三百多万亩，都获得了显著的增产；据山东省估计，全省增种高产作物九百多万亩，约增产三十亿斤。大量兴修的各种水利工程，以工程效益计，可增加灌溉面积一亿六千多万亩，可改善灌溉面积七千多万亩，估计除因洪水损坏、工程未完和质量较差的以外，实际上约可扩大灌溉面积一亿亩以上。增积肥料的工作，据十三个省的统计，一般为常年的一倍到两倍。推广双轮双铧犁和其他新式农具约一百多万部，大部分都起了好作用。防治病虫害、改进栽培技术、水土保持、改良土壤等工作，都做出了很大的成绩。应该说：没有全国的合作化，这些措施就不能这样大量推行；没有这些有效的增产技术措施，实现了合作化也不能在遭受严重灾害袭击下获得相当大量增产的成绩。
        不能抓住一时一事的情况对全盘工作做结论
    任何一件重大的工作，都很难完全一帆风顺，只有成绩，毫无缺点；相反，许多事情的成功是接受了失败经验后取得的。农业增产措施的推广也不能例外。有缺点应该批评，应该纠正；但要看到全面，分清主要的和次要的，肯定成绩，批评缺点。有的人不是全面地观察问题，抓住一时一事的失败事例，大肆指责批评，做出了有害的结论。这种例子是很多的。如四川推广的银坊稻，在生长期间看起来不如本地种好；当时，有些社员怕减收，意见纷纷。有人说：“推广人员是坏媒人，给四川人娶了个银坊姑娘，害死了四川人。”有些干部也就只说不好的一面，给政府写信，给报纸投稿，一时闹得人心惶惶。秋收的时候，银坊稻增了产，事实克服了混乱思想，稳定了情绪。湖北、湖南推广“青森五号”稻种，由于对这种稻子到南方种的方法还摸的不够清楚，有一部分生长不正常，或生长不好，收成较低；但“青森五号”稻种在两湖是否根本不能种植，还有待科学试验和多次试种的结果才能肯定。这种事本来也是在新生事物中难以避免的。但是，也受到了过多的批评和指责，伤害了干部和农民群众的情绪。从去年对农业增产技术措施推广中所碰到的这些实例来看，这应该当作一条基本的教训来接受。
            要经常支持先进思想克服落后思想
    先进与落后思想的斗争在农业合作社中是经常存在的，在群众中任何时候都存在着先进、中间、落后的三种状态。先进的农业增产技术措施的推广，总是首先由积极分子带头和支持，带动着广大农民群众前进，同时也一定会碰到落后思想的障碍和抵抗。如果这些措施贯彻执行以后获得了显著的增产效果，群众情绪高涨，落后思想就被克服了。但是，往往总是有许多措施成功了，也有一些没有搞好，失败了；或者某项措施基本上是成功的，但也搞出来一些缺点甚至错误。在这种情况下，保守落后的人就得到了“根据”，进行抵抗，中间群众就动摇起来，积极分子情绪波动。在这情况下，如果领导方面不能及时肯定成绩、批评缺点并帮助改正，就会闹到全盘否定、损害工作。以去年河北省曲阳县推广白马牙玉米为例，当本地玉米已经抽花出穗的时候，白马牙玉米因生长期较长还在发育秸秆和叶子，群众怕只长秆子不抽穗，思想动摇，本来就反对的人反映到北京，人民日报和河北日报也发表了读者的批评意见。但秋后收获的结果，白马牙玉米一般比本地玉米产量高出了七、八十斤。如果当时不能坚持下来，岂不要造成很大的损失？因此，在推广农业增产技术措施中，经常支持先进，不断克服落后，应该是一条十分重要的经验。
            要把长远利益和目前利益结合起来
    有些增产措施是当年投了资、两年或几年才能得利，或者是当年得利很小、以后才能得大利的，如兴修水利、改良土壤、水土保持、植树造林、繁殖耕畜、饲养幼畜等等。为了长远的利益，这些措施必须根据农业生产合作社的财力、劳力状况，有计划地逐年进行，不断提高生产。这个道理本来是很浅显的。可是，往往有些社员只顾当年收益，不愿搞这些措施；就是搞了的，也有因为当年受益较小，得不到报酬，或者得到的报酬很少，就埋怨领导干部，埋怨积极分子。因此，要经常进行长远利益和目前利益相结合的教育，既不要贪多贪大，不顾实际投资能力，妨碍社员的收入增加和生活改善，也必须照顾长远利益，有计划地进行。这也应该是一条基本的经验。
                保护积极性，克服盲目性
    去年由于某些人对合作化高潮所带来的有利因素估计过高，加以对各项增产技术措施必须因时因地制宜注意不够，因而要求过高，求成过急。例如双轮双铧犁的推广计划订得过大，在本来不适宜使用的地区，仅凭个别试验就大量推广。在推广良种工作中，虽然有些品种原是很好的，但在新推广地区没有进行试验，或者只作了很少的试验，对品种生长的特性和耕作方法还没有搞清楚，就大面积推广，以致生长不良而减产。尽管这些缺点和错误是工作中难以避免的，也应该严格检查，接受教训。只要有错误，就虚心认错，切实改正。这些错误，有的是基层干部机械执行上级规定搞出来的，有些干部甚至采用了强迫命令的办法，当然他们是有错误的；但是，他们的出发点是好的，是为了增产，为了响应上级号召。对这些干部，首先要保护他们的积极性，同时帮助他们实事求是地改正错误。有些错误是上级领导机关造成的，上级领导部门应当承担责任，认真克服主观主义、官僚主义。至于个别的是思想十分恶劣的违法乱纪屡教不改的坏干部，当然应受到应有的纪律制裁。
    要争取今年农业生产的大丰收，必须有积极有效的措施。应该认真总结去年的经验，凡是成功了的，都应继续大力推行；凡是搞错了的，就应找出错误原因，接受失败教训；一时不能得出结论的，应该进一步作小型试验。
