　　Strictly Control Public Cloth for Government Offices
    There seems to be a trend now: regardless of district, county, or provincial-level government organizations, as long as a building is renovated, curtains are installed regardless of actual need; tables placed in clubs or conference rooms are routinely covered with tablecloths; every auditorium has a backdrop hung on the stage, some even have two or three layers, decorating the stage like a theater stage. I believe that except for important hotels and auditoriums that need these decorations and arrangements, general government organizations should use less or no curtains, tablecloths, and backdrops, adhering to the spirit of hard work, simplicity, and saving cotton cloth for the country. At the same time, local textile companies should also strictly control the supply of public cloth to various government organizations.

　　严格控制机关公用布
    现在似乎有这样一个风气：不论区、县、省级的机关团体，只要修好一幢房屋，不管实际需要与否，都要一律安上窗帘布；凡是安放在俱乐部或会议室的桌子，照例要铺上台布；一个礼堂，都要在讲台上挂起一层幕布，有的甚至挂上两层以至三层，把讲台布置得像戏台一样。我认为除那些重要的宾馆和礼堂需要这些装饰和布置外，一般的机关团体应该本着艰苦朴素和为国家节约棉布的精神，少用或不用窗帘、台布和幕布。同时，各地纺织品公司也应该严格控制对各机关团体公用布的供应。    蒋泰昌
