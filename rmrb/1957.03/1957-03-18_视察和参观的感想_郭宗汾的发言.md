I wholeheartedly endorse Chairman Mao's instructions at the Supreme State Conference, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation at the preparatory meeting, Premier Zhou's report at the conference, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report. I will study them diligently to improve my level.

Chairman Mao told us that China will fundamentally change its face after three or four Five-Year Plans, and specifically pointed out that the proportion of investment in heavy industry versus light industry and agriculture should be changed during the Second Five-Year Plan. That is to say, the proportion of investment in light industry and agriculture should be increased. This measure will not only not affect the principle of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, but also accelerate the pace of industrialization, which is entirely correct.

Last year, I participated in inspection, consolation, and visit activities in Jiangsu. I have some insights from actual contact, and I am reporting them to the conference for reference.

Cooperation Increased Production and Overcame Disasters

After the high tide of agricultural cooperation in Jiangsu, the development of advanced agricultural cooperatives was also very rapid. Advanced cooperatives not only demonstrated the superiority of increasing production but also demonstrated the superiority of disaster relief. People's views on cooperatives have changed greatly. People who were skeptical, waited and watched, or even had emotional fluctuations after joining the cooperative, now trust the cooperative and have a sense of interdependence. This achievement, gained through practical education, is very valuable. From the actual situations of the twelve advanced agricultural cooperatives we saw in Changzhou City, Wujin County, Wuxi City, County, Changshu County, Xuzhou City, Tongshan County, and Juining County, the production enthusiasm of the members has been greatly improved, especially women, due to the encouragement of equal pay for equal work. Their attendance rate has increased significantly, so they have the strength to cultivate intensively, carry out reforms, pay attention to technology, accumulate a large amount of fertilizer, apply fertilizer, and develop sideline production, providing favorable conditions for increasing agricultural production. Just taking the Xiangshan Cooperative in Tongshan County as an example, one brigade only did 270,000 work points in 1955, but 550,000 work points in 1956, an increase of more than one time in labor productivity. Therefore, their yield per mu in 1956 reached 429 jin, an increase of 89 jin compared to the bumper harvest year of 1955. After the abolition of private land ownership, the planting area was expanded due to the opening of land boundaries, which facilitated the construction of water conservancy. The Jinxing Cooperative in Changshu County set up machine irrigation, turning the "pot bottom fields" that produced three crops in nine years into fertile fields that can have a good harvest every year. Not only that, advanced cooperatives have also shown many achievements in disaster resistance and relief. One morning after a rain, the Xiangshan Cooperative in Tongshan County mobilized more than 1,000 members to drain more than half a foot of water from more than 2,000 mu of fields. After a hailstorm, 1,480 jin of beans were picked up from the fields. Therefore, the farmers said: If it were not for the fact that the advanced cooperative has a large number of people with united hearts, these things would never have been done. In the disaster area of ​​Juining, 440,000 disaster victims in the county had no food to eat in October, and relief grain would not be shipped until December; the mutual assistance during this period completely depended on the cooperatives. The head of Juining County told us: Cooperatives are really too good, and they have solved many problems for us. In the past, in the event of a disaster like this year, the victims would have fled famine long ago, but now, everyone is persisting in production and self-rescue in the cooperative.

Widows, widowers, orphans and the childless are all cared for

From our inspection, we also saw that the moral qualities of the members have been significantly improved under the education of the Party. Each cooperative has three or twenty households of "Five Guarantees" households, and appropriate arrangements have been made for them. The Guoqing Cooperative in Xuzhou City has thirteen households that are well taken care of out of more than 600 households. The standard is a subsidy of 360 jin of grain per person per year, 20 yuan in cash, and a supply of year-round fuel. When we visited the disaster victims in the Juxing Cooperative in Juining County, we also saw that some "Five Guarantees" households received priority care and expressed their feelings of interdependence with the cooperative. Two orphans in the Xiangshan Cooperative in Tongshan County almost starved to death before joining the cooperative, but after joining the cooperative, they are now raised fat and dark-skinned. They said: "If advanced cooperatives were not established, we would have starved to death long ago. We will never forget the Communist Party." These facts reflect the members' firm confidence in the cooperative. Therefore, I believe that the foundation of advanced cooperatives has been gradually consolidated, and the question now is how to whip the horse faster on a smooth road.

However, we also realized that the advanced cooperatives have only been established for one year, and the production potential has not been fully utilized, especially the potential of sideline production is still very large. For example, the Chunlei Cooperative in Wuxi County excavated a piece of rotten reed field on the edge of the village into more than a dozen fish ponds, turning the place where borers used to hide into a base for fish production, thereby greatly increasing sideline income. Such measures are very possible in other cooperatives, and it is hoped that they will be promoted to open up broader prospects for sideline production.

Water hazards have turned into water conservancy

I also participated in the Sheyang River Sluice Gate Construction Site Consolation Group organized by all sectors of Jiangsu to conduct consolation at the construction site, and personally learned about the people's enthusiasm for supporting and loving the government. From them, I heard that the Sheyang River is a disaster-prone river. In the past, I don’t know how many people and animals’ lives were swallowed, and how many farmlands and properties were lost. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, only one disaster drowned more than 13,000 people, and no one ever came to manage it. If there was, it was just an excuse to collect money, adding another layer of man-made disasters to the people on top of natural disasters. One worker whose entire family of eight was drowned was even more resentful when he talked about it. Since Chairman Mao instructed that "the Huai River must be repaired well," the government quickly implemented it and built this large river gate for the people, which not only guaranteed the harvest of thousands of acres of farmland in the Lixiahe area, but more importantly, 7 million people would no longer be threatened by seawater flooding. If it were not for the Communist Party, who would be willing to do such a good thing for the people? The speed of the project of this river gate is amazing. They completed the task ahead of schedule and created many model deeds. The construction site is not only like a technical school, but also like a political school, cultivating thousands of outstanding workers and also training many strong cadres. The construction of this river gate shows the great superiority of socialism. However, this construction achievement quickly affected other regions. When I went to Xuzhou for inspection, the people of Xuzhou raised a request, hoping that they would quickly build a reservoir in the southern part of the Yimeng Mountain area of Shandong to eliminate the perennial disasters in this area; at the same time, they also proposed that the "Bulao River" should be widened as soon as possible to connect the Weishan Lake and the Grand Canal. When I arrived in Lianyungang, the people also proposed to build the Linhong River Sluice Gate as soon as possible. The people know that good things cannot be done all at once, and the government has many good things to do for the people, which must be done in separate steps. However, the people have seen the successful projects, the effects are so great, and the water hazards that threaten their lives need to be solved urgently, so they expressed excessive demands, which is also understandable. I suggest that in the Second Five-Year Plan, more water conservancy projects that do not require large investment, have quick results, and affect people's lives can be done to meet the people's wishes.

In addition, during the inspection, I also learned that Lianyungang still has great potential that has not been utilized. The people hope to open passenger transport with Shanghai and Qingdao, and also hope to build a fishing port there, which is relatively easy to do. In order to mobilize all positive factors to build socialism, I think it is necessary to accelerate preparations.

Talents were not appreciated in the old society, but talents can be brought into full play in the new society

Last November, I also participated in the Wuhan visiting group jointly organized by the Jiangsu Provincial and Nanjing Municipal Committees of the CPPCC and visited the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. The scale of this bridge is rare even in the world, and many people know about it, so I will not talk about it. What I want to say is that the reactionary Kuomintang regime also wanted to build this bridge and invited American engineers to survey it. They drilled in a few places and thought there was no way to proceed, so they stopped halfway. However, the People's Government, in view of the people's urgent needs, decided to build this large bridge. After repeated surveys, they finally found a way to cross the Han River first and then the Yangtze River, and selected the most reasonable location, connecting the three towns of Wuhan into one. Thanks to the wise leadership of the Party and the engineers' careful research, with the help of Soviet experts, using Chinese materials and Chinese tools, and adopting the world's most advanced pipe column jet pile driving method, workers were not put in danger of sinking to the bottom of the water. Therefore, the completion time was greatly shortened. It will be open to traffic before this year's National Day. From this, I realized the great role of communism in transforming the objective world, and also proved that the scientific achievements of socialist countries are far superior to those of capitalist countries.

In Wuhan, we also visited the magnificent construction of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Base, visited the Jiang'an Locomotive Factory with a glorious history, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wuhan Medical College which has reached the international level, and the South Central Nationalities College which correctly embodies the national policy, and also paid our respects to the Shi Yang Martyrs Cemetery. Each place gave us great inspiration and great encouragement. The Jiangsu Provincial and Nanjing Municipal Committees of the CPPCC have always been concerned about the lives and studies of people from all walks of life. The organization of this visiting group has especially played a positive role in uniting people from all walks of life. Therefore, when everyone discussed their feelings about this trip on the way back to Nanjing, no one was not deeply moved and willing to contribute everything to socialist construction. Not only the members of the visiting group are like this, but in all our contacts, we often see some intellectuals and scientific and technological personnel who were mostly unappreciated in the old society and even lived in poverty. Once they arrived in the new society, under the training of the Party, their wisdom has improved and they are shouldering the arduous and glorious tasks assigned by the Party. For example, the engineering personnel working on the Yangtze River Bridge are a good example.

My personal study is still very shallow, and I know even less about administration and construction. The above is just some of my feelings and experiences, and I hope the conference will correct me.

    视察和参观的感想
    郭宗汾的发言
    我对毛主席在最高国务会议上的指示、李富春副总理在预备会议上的说明、周总理在大会上的报告以及陈叔通副主席的工作报告都表示衷心地拥护，并且要好好地学习以提高我的水平。
    毛主席告诉我们中国将在三、四个五年计划之后，根本改变它的面貌，并且具体地指出第二个五年计划，重工业与轻工业、农业投资的比例要有所变更。也就是说要提高轻工业和农业的投资的比重，这种措施不但不影响优先发展重工业的原则，而且可以使工业化的速度加快，这是完全正确的。
    我去年在江苏参加了视察、慰劳、参观等活动，从实际接触中有些体会，我把它报告出来供大会参考。
    合作化增加了生产战胜了灾荒
    江苏在全国农业合作化高潮之后，高级农业合作社的发展也是很快的。高级合作社不仅发挥了增产的优越性而且表现了救灾的优越性。人民对合作社的看法已有很大改变。过去怀疑、观望甚至在入社后情绪波动的人，现在都对合作社信任起来，有着相依为命的心情。这种通过现实教育而得来的成绩，是非常可贵的。从我们在常州市、武进县、无锡市、县、常熟县、徐州市、铜山县、雎宁县所看到的十二个高级农业合作社的实际情况，社员的生产情绪是大大地提高了，特别是妇女由于同工同酬的鼓励，出勤率更显著的提高，因之就有力量来精耕细作，进行改制，讲求技术，大量积肥、肥施，发展副业生产，为农业增产提供了有利条件。单就铜山县象山合作社的一个大队统计，1955年只做二十七万工分，1956年则为五十五万工分，劳动生产力增大了一倍还多。所以他们每亩地的产量1956年就达到四百二十九斤，比起1955年的丰产年还增多八十九斤。在土地私有制取消以后，由于地界打开，从而扩大了种植面积，便利了兴修水利。常熟县的金星合作社办起机器灌溉，将九年三熟的锅底田变成年年可以丰收的良田。不仅如此，高级合作社在抗灾救灾上也表现很多的成就，铜山县象山合作社在一个雨后的早晨，出动了一千多个社员，从二千多亩田里排除了半尺多深的水。在一次冰雹下过以后，从地里拾回了一千四百八十斤的豆子。所以农民们都说：如果不是高级社人多心齐，这些事决不会做出来的。雎宁灾区，全县四十四万灾民在10月份就没有粮吃了，而救济粮12月份才能运到；在这一个时期内的有无互济是完全靠合作社的。雎宁县长对我们说：合作社实在是太好了，给我们解决了好多问题。像今年这样灾情，如果在过去，灾民早就逃荒了，而现在呢，大家都在社里坚持生产自救。
    鳏寡孤独皆有所养
    我们从视察中还看到社员的道德品质在党的教养下显著地提高了。各社均有五保户的对象三、二十户不等，对他们都有适当的安排。徐州市国庆合作社，在六百多户中，就有十三户受到很好的照顾，标准是每人全年补助粮食三百六十斤、现款二十元并供常年燃料。在雎宁县炬星合作社慰问灾民时，也看到一些五保户受到优先的照顾对合作社表示了相依如命的心情。铜山县象山合作社有两个孤儿在没有入社以前几乎饿死，入社以后养的又黑又胖。他们说：“如果不办高级合作社我们早就饿死了。我们是永远不会忘掉共产党的。”这些事实反映了社员对合作社的坚定信心。所以我认为高级合作社的基础已逐步巩固，今后是如何在坦途中打马加鞭的问题了。
    但是我们也体会到，高级合作社成立的时间只有一年，生产的潜力还没有完全发挥，尤其是副业的生产潜力还很大。像无锡县春雷合作社把村边的一片烂苇田掘成十几个鱼塘，使过去螟虫藏伏的地方变成鱼类生产的基地，因而大大提高了副业收入。这样的措施在其他各社都很有可能，希望加以倡导，使副业生产开辟更广大的前途。
    水害变成了水利
    我还参加了江苏各界组织的射阳河闸工地慰劳团去工地进行慰劳，亲自了解到人民对政府拥护爱戴的热情。从他们那里听到：射阳河是一个多灾的河流，过去若干年不知道吞噬多少人畜生命，漂没了多少田园财产。只国民党反动统治时期的一次灾害，就淹死了一万三千多人命，从来没有人来给治理。有之亦不过是借故敛财，使人民在天灾之外又加一层人祸而已。有一位全家八口都被淹死的民工，谈起来更为愤恨。自从毛主席指示“一定要把淮河修好”以后，政府就很快地贯彻执行，为人民建立这一个大的河闸，不但保障了里下河地区千万亩农田丰收，更要紧的是七百万人民再也不会受海水淹没的威胁。如果不是共产党，谁肯来为人民办这样的好事。这个河闸的工程进度之快是惊人的，他们提前完成了任务，并且创造很多模范事迹。工地不仅像一个技术学校，而且也像一个政治学校，培养着成千上万的优秀工人，也锻炼着不少的坚强干部。这个河闸的建设显示着社会主义极大优越性。但是这种建设成就也很快地影响了其他地区。当我到徐州视察时，徐州人民就提出要求，希望给他们赶快在山东沂蒙山区南部建立水库，以消除这一地区的连年灾害；同时又提出“不老河”要赶快扩宽以沟通微山湖和运河水运的要求。到了新海连市，人民也提出要赶快建筑临洪河闸的要求，人民知道好事不能一下子做完，政府要给人民办的好事还很多，必须分开步骤。但是人民已经看到成功的工程，效果那么大，而威胁着自己生活的水害问题又急需解决，因此表示了过多的要求这也是可以理解的。我建议在第二个五年计划中像这些投资不大收效较快而又影响着人民生活的水利工程，可以多办一些以满足人民的愿望。
    此外，在视察中还了解到连云港尚有很大潜力没被利用，人民希望与上海、青岛开通客运，也希望在那里建筑渔港，这些是比较容易做到的。为调度一切积极因素来建设社会主义，我认为有必要加速筹备。旧社会怀才不遇，新社会发挥所长
    去年11月间我还参加了政协江苏省、南京市委员会联合组织的武汉参观团，参观了武汉长江大桥的建筑。这个桥的规模就是在世界上也是稀有的，知道的人很多，我不去谈了。我要说的是这个桥在国民党反动政权也曾经想建筑，并且邀请美国的工程师来勘察，他们钻了几个地方认为没有法子进行，就中途停止了。而人民政府鉴于人民有这样迫切的需要，就决心建筑这一大桥。经过反复勘察，终于找到了先渡汉水再渡长江的办法，选定了最合理的位置，使武汉三镇联成一体。由于党的英明领导，与工程师们的细心钻研，在苏联专家的帮助下，用中国的材料、中国的工具，采用了世界上最先进的管柱喷射打桩法，使工人不至冒着性命的危险沉在水底作业。因此大大地缩短了完成时间。在今年的国庆节以前就可以通车了。从这里我体会到了共产主义改造客观世界的伟大作用，也证明了社会主义国家的科学成就比资本主义国家是优越的多了。
    我们在武汉还参观了规模宏伟的武汉钢铁基地的建设，也参观了有光荣历史的江岸机车厂，达到国际水平的武汉医学院第二附属医院以及正确地体现着民族政策的中南民族学院，并且敬谒了施洋烈士陵墓。每到一处都给了我们很大的启发，给了我们很大的鼓舞。政协江苏省、南京市委员会一向是关心各界人士的生活学习的，这次参观团的组织，尤其起到团结各界人士的积极作用。所以在回南京的途中大家座谈此行的感想时，没有一个不是抱着万分感动的心情，愿意把自己的一切贡献给社会主义建设的。不仅参观团的成员如此，就是我们在一切接触中也常常看到一些知识分子、科技人员，他们在旧社会大多是怀才莫遇甚至潦倒终身，而一到新社会在党的培养下，智慧都高起来了，肩负党所给的艰巨而光荣的任务。例如，工作在长江大桥的工程人员就是一个很好榜样。
    我个人学习还很浅，对于行政和建设各方面知道的更少。以上所谈仅只是我的一些感想和体会，敬希大会指正。
