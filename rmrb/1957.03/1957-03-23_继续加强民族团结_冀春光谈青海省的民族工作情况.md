I fully support Chairman Mao Zedong's instructions at the Supreme State Conference and fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's political report, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the CPPCC, and the summary report on the work of the short-term study classes for industrialists and businessmen at this CPPCC meeting. Now, I will discuss the ethnic work situation in the Qinghai region and offer some opinions. Please correct me if anything is wrong.

Achievements in Implementing Ethnic Policies

Qinghai is a multi-ethnic region with complex ethnic and religious circumstances, and its economy and culture are relatively backward. In the few years since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, and through the joint efforts of all cadres and leading figures who maintain contact with the people, great achievements have been made in various tasks, and the face of our province has undergone significant changes. This is mainly due to the full implementation of ethnic regional autonomy based on the policy of ethnic equality and unity. Six autonomous prefectures and seven autonomous counties have been established, realizing the political equality of all ethnic groups. More than 1,800 ethnic representatives have been united and placed in government organs at the provincial, prefectural, county, and district levels, as well as in places with CPPCC organizations. Most of them can work conscientiously, play an active role, and do beneficial things for the minority ethnic people and the country. At the same time, nearly 4,000 minority ethnic cadres have been cultivated and promoted throughout the province. They generally maintain contact with the masses and work actively and enthusiastically. In terms of enhancing ethnic unity, we have helped mediate more than 20,000 ethnic and intra-ethnic disputes, including the major historical disputes between Tongren and Jianzha, and between Ganjia and Jiawu, which had persisted for nearly a century. Furthermore, we have annihilated more than 90 gangs of bandits led by Ma Yuanxiang and others, stabilized social order, and unprecedentedly strengthened the close unity between the people of all ethnic groups in agricultural and pastoral areas. For example, in Yaman Township of Xunhua Salar Autonomous County, there was a fertile piece of land that neither the Tibetan nor the Salar people could cultivate before liberation due to disunity. After liberation, through education on ethnic unity and production development, they jointly organized a land reclamation team, turning this wasteland into fertile fields and establishing a joint ethnic cooperative. This fact illustrates that unity brings happiness to all ethnic groups. By conscientiously implementing the policy of ethnic equality and unity, and freedom of religious belief, the economic and cultural construction of our province has been rapidly developed. The number of livestock has increased from more than 7 million in 1949 to more than 15 million today. Last year, in areas with a good working foundation, we piloted 35 pastoral cooperatives and one joint state-private ranch. Sixteen of these cooperatives were run relatively well, increasing income and demonstrating the superiority of organization, pointing out the direction for the gradual socialist transformation of animal husbandry. The grain output of the entire province reached self-sufficiency in 1954. Last Year the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicraft industry, and capitalist industry and commerce has been basically completed in the agricultural areas. In particular, the Qaidam Basin is rich in mineral resources and has great oil prospects, which will bring broad development prospects to our province. People of all ethnic groups are cheering for this and are full of confidence in welcoming this glorious and arduous task.

Some Experiences in Cooperating with Upper-Class Minority Nationalities

In addition to the above achievements, we have the following preliminary experiences in implementing the Party's policy of "long-term cooperation" with upper-class minority nationalities and in working together: First, after liberation, Xiang Qian, the head of the Angla thousand-household, was once deceived by counter-revolutionaries and engaged in armed confrontation with the government. After seventeen repeated political efforts, combined with military suppression focused on political persuasion, he finally repented, recognized the ugly faces of the counter-revolutionaries, distinguished between the enemy and ourselves, and leaned towards the government. He served as the county head of Jianzha County and has done many good things for the people in recent years. Last year, in stabilizing social order in the pastoral areas, he used his personal experience to explain the situation, stabilizing the emotions of many upper-class figures and playing a considerable role. This fact educated us, making us realize the importance of adhering to the policy of striving for, uniting, and educating upper-class minority nationalities. Even if some individuals are ideologically backward and often say destructive things, they must never be confused with the rumors and sabotage of counter-revolutionaries. Only by continuously exposing the conspiracies of counter-revolutionaries can we gradually enable them to recognize the enemy and ourselves, so that they will no longer be deceived by counter-revolutionaries and will truly lean towards the Party and the government. Second, since the promotion of the socialist transformation of animal husbandry last year, many upper-class ethnic figures have had great doubts. In response to this situation, we repeatedly explained the policies and listened attentively to their different opinions on the implementation of the policies. These opinions can help us to fully understand the situation and fully consider ethnic characteristics, so that the policies can be more practical in their implementation. It can also enable upper-class ethnic figures to understand the spirit of the policies in light of local conditions. This dispelled the doubts of a large number of people, and they expressed their support for piloting pastoral cooperatives. Some even proposed taking the lead in piloting them. However, in the pilot projects, some cooperatives did not handle specific issues well enough, which caused doubts among some people. This is also understandable, but repeatedly clarifying the policies is also very necessary. Third, in recent years, our province has organized more than 1,000 ethnic representatives to visit other places. The vast majority of them have made progress after returning, recognizing the loveliness of the motherland and the greatness of the working class. At the same time, we have organized them to inspect work, get close to the masses, and understand the actual situation, so that upper-class figures have more opportunities to participate in work practice and social life observation, which can gradually enlighten and improve their ideological understanding and ability to distinguish right from wrong. Fourth, at present, many upper-class ethnic figures are eager to make progress. Some of them can consciously conduct criticism and self-criticism and actively ask Han cadres to offer criticisms of them. Past experience has shown that, on the principle of being able to accept their shortcomings, we conditionally advocate the use of self-criticism to achieve the purpose of self-education, or adopt individual conversations to conduct criticism, which can also achieve good results.

Some Shortcomings in Our Work

However, judging from the overall development and requirements of our work, there are still many problems in our ethnic and united front work. There are still many shortcomings and problems in the aspects of placement, unity education, and respect for the functions and powers of upper-class ethnic figures. These shortcomings and problems are: In terms of personnel arrangements, of the more than 5,000 princes, thousand-household heads, hundred-household heads, Living Buddhas, great lamas, religious leaders, and imams in our province, the vast majority who needed to be placed have been placed, but a few have not yet been placed, or their placement has not been timely enough. The positions of a few individuals are also not appropriate enough, and the unity education work after placement is not frequent enough and lacks a system. This is not enough to reflect the spirit of the central government to unite all possible forces and give play to all possible positive factors.

In ethnic regional autonomous organs, most of the external Han cadres can work diligently to serve the minority ethnic peoples, and they have played a great role in the previous work. But there are also some Han cadres who underestimate the role of representative figures, thinking that they come from exploiting backgrounds, and do not let go of using them in their work, do not respect their functions and powers, and do not let them read the documents that should be read and help them handle the issues that should be handled. Insufficient consultation when there is a problem, some regard consultation as going through the motions and become a formality. There are even very few cadres who take over everything in their work, causing great dissatisfaction among upper-class ethnic figures, such as saying: "Minority ethnic groups are in charge, but Han cadres make the decisions." This kind of practice has a great impact on giving play to the active role of upper-class ethnic figures in their work. There are many reasons for this, mainly due to some Han cadres' great Han chauvinism. They do not fully believe in the possibility of upper-class ethnic figures moving towards progress, and they disregard their special role among the people of their own ethnicity. At the same time, there are also a very few upper-class ethnic figures who are not enthusiastic enough in managing the affairs of their own ethnicity. Although they have positions, they do not perform their duties, are unwilling to participate in the daily work of the organs, only participate in a few meetings, and a very few people cannot even be invited to meetings, let alone have power with their positions.

Our Work in the Future

To solve the above problems, we must continue to work hard to implement the policies of ethnic equality and unity, freedom of religious belief, and long-term cooperation, so as to further strengthen ethnic unity and do a good job on the basis of past work.

First, according to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, we will conduct a general inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies and united front work throughout our province, to further overcome the great Han chauvinistic thoughts of Han cadres. According to the recent inspection in the provincial-level organs, some cadres believe that the socialist transformation has basically been completed in the agricultural areas, the class relations have undergone fundamental changes, and the role of ethnic and united front work is not great, so it is not as important as it used to be. Therefore, through inspection, we will conduct an education on ethnic and united front policies for cadres in general, focusing on criticizing great Han chauvinistic thoughts, especially humbly listening to the criticisms of minority ethnic cadres and promoting non-Party personnel to inspect united front work, which is of great significance to overcoming great Han chauvinistic thoughts and sectarianism.

Second, for the upper-class ethnic and religious figures who have already been placed, we will further respect their functions and powers within the scope of their work, and guarantee their exercise of their functions and powers from the various systems of the autonomous organs, so that they can preside over the meetings they should preside over, read the documents they should read, and handle the issues they should handle, and resolutely implement the spirit of full consultation. I believe that the process of consultation is the process of communicating policies and thoughts, helping each other, and doing a good job together. Taking over everything in the work is not only a great obstacle to giving play to the initiative of representative figures and gradually improving their working ability, but also very harmful to ethnic unity.

In addition, according to the progress of our province's work, we will place another batch of ethnic representative figures in government organs and CPPCC organs at all levels, to expand the united front.

Third, in the past, our province organized Han cadres to learn the languages of minority ethnic groups in the pastoral areas, and achieved good results. At present, cadres who have worked for a long time have generally learned everyday language, and can do some ordinary social engagements and contact work. Some can work independently without translation. This has greatly strengthened the connection with upper-class minority ethnic figures, cadres, and the masses, and facilitated the work. However, according to the large increase in the number of cadres in our province in the past two years, most people cannot use the languages of minority ethnic groups to carry out their work, so it is still very necessary to continue to organize Han cadres to learn the languages of minority ethnic groups.

### 继续加强民族团结  冀春光谈青海省的民族工作情况

    继续加强民族团结
    冀春光谈青海省的民族工作情况
    我完全拥护毛泽东主席在最高国务会议上的指示，并完全同意这次政协会议上周恩来总理的政治报告，陈叔通副主席的会务工作和关于工商业者短期讲习班的工作总结报告。现在我就青海地区的民族工作谈一些情况和意见，不对的地方请各位指正批评。
    贯彻民族政策的成就
  青海是个多民族的地区，民族和宗教情况都比较复杂，经济和文化也比较落后。解放几年来，在党中央的正确领导下，经过全体干部与人民群众有联系的领袖人物的共同努力，使各项工作取得了很大的成就，使我省的面貌有了显著的变化。这主要是根据民族平等团结政策，全面实行了民族区域自治，建立了自治州六个、自治县七个，实现了各民族在政治上的平等。在省、州、县、区级政权机关和有政协组织的地方，团结安置了各民族代表人士一千八百多人，他们大多数都能认真工作，发挥积极作用，给少数民族人民和国家办了有益的事情。同时，在全省内培养与提拔了各少数民族干部近四千人，他们一般地都能联系群众，积极热情的工作。在增强民族团结方面，帮助调解了民族间和民族内部的大小纠纷两万余件，其中包括延续将近百年来未解决的同仁与尖扎、甘加与加吾的重大历史纠纷也得到了解决。并且剿灭了马元祥等股匪九十余股，安定了社会秩序，使农、牧业区各族人民之间的亲密团结空前增强。如在循化撒拉族自治县崖曼乡，有块肥沃的地土，解放前，藏族与撒拉族因闹不团结，谁也不能开垦；解放后，经过民族团结和发展生产的教育，他们共同组织了垦荒队，将这块荒滩变成了良田，并成立了一个民族联合社，这一事实说明，团结会给各族人民带来幸福。就这样认真的贯彻了民族平等团结、宗教信仰自由政策，使我省各项经济和文化建设得到迅速的发展，各类牧畜由1949年的七百多万头发展为现在的一千五百多万头。去年在工作基础较好的地区，试办了三十五个牧业社和一个公私合营牧场，其中有十六个社办的较好，增加了收入，显示了组织起来的优越性，指明了畜牧业逐步进行社会主义改造的方向。全省粮食产量从1954年达到自给，去年在农业区，已基本完成了对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，特别是柴达木盆地矿藏丰富，石油希望很大，将会给我省带来广阔的发展前途，各民族人民为此欢欣鼓舞，信心百倍的迎接这个光荣艰巨的任务。
    和少数民族上层人士合作的几点体会
    除上述成绩外，几年来在执行党与民族上层人士“长期合作”的政策和合作共事的关系中，我们有如下一些粗浅的体会：第一，解放后我省的昂拉千户项谦，曾一度上过反革命分子的当，与政府实行武装对抗，先后经过了我们十七次反复的政治争取，在政治争取为主结合军事进剿的情况下，终于他悔悟过来，认清了反革命分子的丑恶面貌，分清了敌我，靠拢了政府，担任了尖扎县县长，几年来为人民办了不少好事。去年在安定牧业区社会秩序中，他根据自己亲身体验，现身说法，安定了很多上层人士的情绪，起了相当的作用。这一事实教育了我们，使我们认识到，对少数民族上层人士，坚持执行争取团结教育政策的重要性。即便有个别人思想落后，常说破坏话，也绝不能与反革命的造谣、破坏混为一谈。只有不断揭露反革命分子的阴谋，才能逐渐的使他们认清敌我，再不受反革命分子的欺骗，真正靠拢党和政府。第二，去年宣传畜牧业社会主义改造以来，许多民族上层人士疑虑很大，根据这种情况，我们对政策反复作了交代，并虚心听取了他们对政策执行中的不同意见。这些意见可以帮助我们全面了解情况，充分照顾民族特点，使政策在贯彻执行中，更加切合实际，也可以使民族上层人士结合当地情况明了政策精神。这样做解除了很大一部分人的疑虑，他们表示拥护试办牧业社，有的还提出带头试办。但是，在试办中，有的社对具体问题处理的不够好，又引起了一些人的疑虑，这也是可以理解的，不过，反复交清政策，也是很有必要的。第三，几年来我省共组织了一千多名民族代表人士出外参观，回来后绝大多数都有了进步，认识到祖国的可爱和工人阶级的伟大；同时组织他们视察工作，接近群众，了解实际情况，使上层人士有更多的机会参加工作实践和社会生活的观察，就可以逐步启示提高他们的思想认识和明辨是非的能力。第四，目前有很多民族上层人士迫切要求进步，其中有一部分人能自觉的进行批评与自我批评，主动要求汉族干部对他们提出批评意见。以往经验证明，对他们的缺点在能接受的原则下，有条件的提倡通过自我批评的方法，达到自我教育的目的，或者采取个别恳谈的方式，进行批评，也可收到良好效果。
    工作中的一些缺点
    但是，从整个工作的发展和要求来看，我们的民族、统战工作还存在很多问题，在对民族上层人士的安置、团结教育和职权尊重方面，还有不少缺点和毛病。这些缺点和毛病是：在人士安排方面，对我省王公、千百户、活佛、大喇嘛、教长、阿訇等共计五千多人中，需要安置的绝大部分都作了安置，但是有少数人还没有得到安置，或安置的不够及时，个别人安置的职位也不够恰当，对安置后的团结教育工作做的不够经常，也缺乏系统，这对体现中央团结一切可能团结的力量，发挥一切可能发挥的积极因素精神是不够的。
    在民族区域自治政权内，多数外来汉族干部能勤勤恳恳为少数民族人民服务，在以往的工作中起了很大作用。但是也有些汉族干部，对代表人士的作用估计不足，认为他们是剥削分子出身，在工作中不放手使用他们，不尊重他们的职权，不让他们阅读应该阅读的文件，帮助处理应该处理的问题，遇事协商不够，有的把协商看成走过场，流于形式，甚至有极少数干部在工作中包办代替，造成民族上层人士很大的不满，如说：“少数民族当家，汉族干部作主”。这样的做法，对发挥民族上层人士在工作中的积极作用有很大影响。其原因很多，主要是由于一些汉族干部的大汉族主义作祟。他们不完全相信民族上层人士能够走向进步的可能性，漠视他们在本民族人民中的特有作用。同时，也有极少数的民族上层人士，在管理本民族事务上不够热忱，虽然有了职务而不到职，不愿参加机关日常工作，只参加几次会议，极个别的人甚至开会也请不来，当然就更谈不到有职有权了。
    我们今后的工作
    要解决上述问题，继续努力贯彻民族平等团结、宗教信仰自由和长期合作政策，以便在过去工作的基础上进一步加强民族团结，做好工作。
    第一，根据中共中央指示，在我省范围内，普遍进行一次民族政策执行情况和统一战线工作的检查，进一步克服汉族干部的大汉族主义思想。根据最近在省级机关的检查，有些干部认为农业区基本上完成了社会主义改造，阶级关系发生了根本变化，民族、统战工作作用不大了，因而也就没有过去重要了。因此，通过检查对干部普遍进行一次民族、统战政策教育，着重批判大汉族主义思想，尤其是虚心听取各少数民族干部的批评和推动党外人士检查统战工作，对克服大汉族主义思想和宗派主义情绪，是具有很重要意义的。
    第二，对已经作了安置的民族、宗教上层人士，进一步尊重他们工作范围内的职权，从自治机关的各种制度上保证他们行使职权，做到他们主持应该主持的会议，阅读应该阅读的文件，处理应该处理的问题，坚决贯彻充分协商的精神。我认为协商过程就是沟通政策思想、互相帮助、共同做好工作的过程。工作中的包办代替不仅对发挥代表人物的积极性和逐步提高其工作能力是很大的障碍，而且也非常有害于民族团结。
    此外，对尚未安置的民族代表人士，按我省工作进展情况，在各级政权、政协机关再安置一批，以扩大团结面。
    第三，以往在我省牧业区，组织汉族干部学习少数民族语文，取得了良好成绩。目前工作时间较长的干部，一般都学会了日常用语，可以作些普通应酬和联系工作，有的不要翻译可以独立进行工作。这大大的加强了与少数民族上层人士、干部和群众的联系，便利了工作。但是根据我省近两年来干部大量增加的情况，多数人还不能运用少数民族语文进行工作，故继续组织汉族干部学习少数民族语文仍是非常必要的。
