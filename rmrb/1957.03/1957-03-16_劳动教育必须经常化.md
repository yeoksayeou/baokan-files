Labor education for students, cultivating their labor perspective, and educating them to love labor and the working people should be a regular task of school education, and should not be relaxed at any time. We know that in the past, the working people were an oppressed and exploited class, and their labor was despised. Now, the alliance of working people in our country has become the foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship, and labor is generally recognized as glorious. This is the fundamental condition for carrying out labor education in schools, and it is also an important social factor that encourages students to accept labor education. Therefore, labor education can be carried out smoothly in schools and is welcomed by students. Students should receive labor education not only in middle and primary schools, but also in universities.

Some people do not pay attention to labor education in middle and primary schools. This is because they do not yet understand the nature of education in our country’s middle and primary schools. The remarks made today by the person in charge of the Ministry of Education pointed out: “Middle and primary school education belongs to the nature of general education, and its task is mainly to improve the people’s cultural level, in order to adapt to the socialist construction’s needs for reserve labor forces with a certain level of political consciousness, cultural cultivation, and healthy physique; on the other hand, it is also necessary to transport a certain number of qualified freshmen to higher and secondary schools. Therefore, most middle and primary school students should engage in industrial and agricultural production labor after graduation, and only a small part of the graduates can be promoted to higher education. This is a matter of course." Therefore, the participation of students who cannot continue their studies after graduating from middle and primary schools in production labor is a fundamental policy of the national education cause, and it is also a fundamental path for middle and primary school graduates who cannot continue their studies.

Not only that, but the fundamental purpose of our people’s education is to promote the continuous development of social productive forces and improve social labor productivity. Students who continue their studies are certainly to further improve their political and cultural level, so that they can better participate in production labor after graduation; middle and primary school graduates who cannot continue their studies and are immediately employed are also directly helpful to the development of social production undertakings.

In order to lay an ideological foundation for middle and primary school graduates to participate in labor production and prepare them, schools must carry out regular labor education. This is to cultivate students to become laborers who transform the world. This will play a significant role in the formation of the entire moral outlook, will, and character of young people and children who are growing up. Labor education is a fundamental part of communist education. Even if middle and primary school students continue their studies, they must continue to receive labor education. The view of despising labor and the working people is the view of the exploiting class, which is the most shameful. Labor can create human material wealth and civilization, and it is the most glorious.

In order to regularize labor education, schools should make reasonable arrangements in conjunction with daily teaching work and carry out education in a concrete and vivid manner, especially by increasing labor production courses. In carrying out labor education, attention should be paid to combining it with patriotism education, collectivism education, discipline education, and the education of building the country with diligence and thrift. Students should not only be educated in classroom lectures, but also be educated in terms of thoughts, feelings, skills, and habits in various labor practices. The leadership and teachers of the Second Middle School in Hefei County, Anhui Province, pay attention to combining labor practice with teaching to cultivate students' labor concepts. For more than three years, students have developed the habit of labor, truly realized the significance of labor glory, and graduates who cannot continue their studies have happily embarked on labor production posts. This fact tells us that regular labor education in schools will achieve good results.

According to the experience of many schools, there are many ways to conduct labor education for students. Organizing various reports and lectures, letting students widely engage in various internships in laboratories, school gardens, and various extracurricular activities; or organizing students to participate in various socially meaningful social labor through the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers, these methods can be adopted. In addition, schools should also encourage students to participate in family labor. When arranging and carrying out these activities, schools should combine them well with students' studies, and should pay attention to not excessively increasing the burden on students and not hindering students' normal learning and health.

Schools should conduct labor education for graduating class students based on the actual situation of the students. Some students are too nervous in order to continue their studies, which affects their health. Some students also feel that their future is bleak because they are afraid of failing the school entrance examinations. Schools should make students clearly understand that whether they continue their studies or participate in labor production in the future, they should seriously learn their lessons well and not be too nervous; but they should also encourage students to use correct learning methods, strive to acquire knowledge, and confidently embark on the future path of life. Schools should comprehensively explain that whether continuing studies or participating in labor production is needed by the country. Some schools only pay attention to conducting labor education for graduating class students, but ignore conducting labor education for all students, which is not right.

It is not enough for schools to make efforts to conduct labor education for students. In addition to the time students spend in school receiving education, they must also receive family education. The requirements and attitudes of parents towards their children on weekdays have a great impact on them. Therefore, parents should have a correct attitude towards their children, give their children labor education from daily life, and help their children avoid and overcome the influence of negative factors. Some middle schools in Beijing have organized parents' committees to contact student parents and exchange experiences in educating their children in order to mobilize parents to better assist schools in educating their children. This is very beneficial for consolidating the achievements of school education.

Labor education is an important political and ideological work. To do this work well and maintain it regularly requires the concern of the Party committee. Party committees at all levels should attach importance to labor education in guiding schools to carry out political and ideological work, regularly understand the progress of labor education, and fully mobilize the strength of teachers and parents to participate in this work, so that students can be influenced by labor education from all aspects. In order to guarantee and improve the level of political and ideological work for students and achieve good results, it is necessary for Party committees at all levels to strengthen the strength of political and ideological work in schools; and designate some Party committee members to regularly make reports to students. To carry out social publicity on labor education, we must not only rely on the strength of all aspects of the Party organization, but also have the support of the Party committee to first solve the ideological problems of cadres at all levels and strengthen the confidence of educational administrative departments and school leaders. Many places reflect that the lack of understanding of cadres often becomes an obstacle to carrying out labor education. Party committees at all levels must educate cadres to treat the issue of children continuing their studies and engaging in labor production with a correct attitude. All senior cadres and senior intellectuals should first conduct labor education for their children and encourage their children to prepare the necessary knowledge and skills for participating in production.

In the past few years, middle and primary schools in various regions have carried out labor education for a wide range of students in conjunction with teaching activities, achieved certain results, and accumulated certain experience. Education departments and schools in various regions should summarize and exchange the experience of labor education; on this basis, raise labor education a step further and regularize it.

### 劳动教育必须经常化

    劳动教育必须经常化
    向学生进行劳动教育，培养学生的劳动观点，教育学生热爱劳动和热爱劳动人民，应当是学校教育的经常任务，任何时候都不能放松。我们知道，过去劳动人民是被压迫被剥削的阶级，他们的劳动受到轻视。现在，我国劳动人民的联盟已经成为人民民主专政的基础，人们已经公认劳动是光荣的。这是学校进行劳动教育的根本条件，也是鼓舞学生能够接受劳动教育的重要的社会因素。因此，劳动教育是可以在学校中顺利进行的，而且是为学生所欢迎的。学生不仅在中、小学里要受到劳动教育，就是在高等学校里也要受到劳动教育。
    有的人不重视中、小学的劳动教育。这是因为他们还不了解我国中、小学教育任务的缘故。今天发表的教育部负责人的谈话指出：“中小学教育属于普通教育的性质，它的任务主要是提高人民文化水平，以适应社会主义建设对具有一定的政治觉悟、文化教养和健康体质的劳动后备力量的需要；另一方面也要为高等和中等学校输送一定数量的合格的新生。因此，中小学学生毕业后应当是大多数从事工农业生产劳动，而升学的只能是毕业生中的一小部分，这是理所当然的。”因此，中、小学毕业后不能升学的学生参加生产劳动，是国家教育事业的一条根本方针，也是不能升学的中、小学毕业生应走的一条根本道路。
    不但这样，我们人民教育的根本目的，是要促进社会生产力的不断发展，提高社会的劳动生产率。学生升学固然是为了进一步提高政治和文化的水平，以便毕业后更好地参加生产劳动；不能升学而立即就业的中、小学毕业生也是直接有助于社会生产事业的发展的。
    为了给中、小学毕业生参加劳动生产打下思想基础，作好准备，学校必须进行经常的劳动教育。这就是要培养学生成为改造世界的劳动者。这对于正在成长中的青年、儿童的整个道德面貌、意志和性格的形成上，将起重大的作用。劳动教育是共产主义教育的根本内容的一部分。中、小学学生即使是升学了，也要继续受到劳动教育。轻视劳动、轻视劳动人民的观点是剥削阶级的观点，这是最可耻的。而劳动却能够创造人类的物质财富和文明，它是最光荣的。
    为了把劳动教育经常化，学校应当结合日常教学工作，作出合理的安排，具体生动地进行教育，特别是要增加劳动生产的课程。在进行劳动教育中，要注意同爱国主义教育、集体主义教育、纪律教育、勤俭建国的教育结合起来。不仅要使学生在课堂讲授中受到教育，而且要使学生在各种劳动实践中，从思想感情、技能、习惯等方面都受到教育。安徽省合肥县第二中学领导方面和教师在教学中注意结合劳动实践来培养学生的劳动观点。三年多以来，学生已经养成劳动的习惯，真正体会到劳动光荣的意义，不能升学的毕业生，就愉快地走上了劳动生产的岗位。这个事实告诉我们，学校经常地进行劳动教育，就会收到良好的效果。
    根据许多学校的经验，向学生进行劳动教育的方法是很多的。组织各种报告和讲座，让学生在实验室、学校园地和各种课外活动中，广泛地从事各种实习；或者通过青年团和少年先锋队，组织学生参加各种富有教育意义的社会劳动，这些办法都可以采用。此外，学校还要鼓励学生参加家庭劳动。学校在安排和进行这些活动的时候，要同学生的学习很好地结合，应当注意不要过分加重学生的负担，不要妨害学生的正常学习和健康。
    学校对于毕业班学生的劳动教育，应当从学生实际情况出发。有的学生为了升学，过分紧张，影响了身体健康。也有的学生怕考不上学校，感到前途渺茫。学校应当使学生认识清楚：不管将来升学或者参加劳动生产，都应该认真地把功课学好，不必过分紧张；但是又应该鼓励学生用正确的学习方法，努力获取知识，满怀信心地走上未来的生活道路。学校应当全面地说明：无论升学或者参加劳动生产，都是为国家所需要的。有的学校只注意对毕业班学生进行劳动教育，而忽视对全体学生进行劳动教育，这是不对的。
    对学生进行劳动教育，仅仅学校方面的努力也还不够。学生除了在学校受教育的时间以外，要受到家庭的教育。家长平日对子女的要求和态度，给他们的影响很大。因此，家长对子女应当有正确的态度，从日常生活中给子女以劳动教育，帮助子女避免和克服消极因素的影响。北京市有的中学为了动员家长更好地协助学校教育子女，组织了家长委员会，分别联系学生家长，交流教育子女的经验。这对于巩固学校教育的成果有很大好处。
    劳动教育是一项重要的政治思想工作。要把这个工作做好，并且保持经常，就需要党委的关怀。各级党委在指导学校进行政治思想工作中，要重视劳动教育，经常了解劳动教育的进行情况，充分动员教师和家长的力量，参加这项工作，使学生耳濡目染，从各方面受到劳动教育的熏陶。为了保证和提高对学生进行政治思想工作的水平，取得良好的效果，各级党委有必要加强学校政治思想工作的力量；并且指定一些党委委员经常向学生作报告。开展劳动教育的社会宣传，不仅要依靠党组织各方面的力量，还必须有党委撑腰才能首先解决各级干部的思想问题，坚定教育行政部门和学校领导人员的信心。许多地方反映：干部思想不通，常常成为开展劳动教育的阻力。各级党委要教育干部，用正确的态度对待子女升学和从事劳动生产的问题。所有的高级干部和高级知识分子都应该首先对自己的子女进行劳动教育，鼓励子女们准备参加生产的必要知识和技能。
    各地中、小学校在过去几年来，结合教学活动，向广大学生进行了劳动教育，有了一定的成绩，并且积累了一定的经验。各地教育部门和学校应当总结和交流劳动教育的经验；在这个基础上，把劳动教育提高一步，并且使它经常化。
