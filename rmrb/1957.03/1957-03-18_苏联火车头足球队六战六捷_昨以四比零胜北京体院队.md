    Soviet Lokomotiv Football Team Wins Sixth Consecutive Victory
    Defeats Beijing Institute of Physical Education Team 4-0 Yesterday

    (Our Newspaper) Beijing, March 17th. The Soviet "Lokomotiv" football team, currently visiting our country, played a wonderful friendly match against the Beijing Institute of Physical Education team at the Beijing Xian Nong Tan Stadium on the afternoon of the 17th. After ninety minutes of intense battle, the Soviet "Lokomotiv" team secured another victory with a score of 4-0. This is their sixth victory since arriving in our country.

    During the attack, the Soviet "Lokomotiv" team used right inside forward Bubukin as a rear support, creating gaps for the forwards to find opportunities to shoot. The first goal was scored when Bubukin received the ball and made a perfect lob, kicking the ball into the penalty area. Four forwards sprinted quickly towards the goal. Center forward Sokolov took a shot just a step ahead of the opposing defender, the ball flew like an arrow, hitting the goalkeeper's hand and bouncing into the net. This was only one and a half minutes after the start of the match.

    The second goal was scored by the visiting team through clever cooperation of long and short passes. In the eighteenth minute, the visiting team's right winger Zaitsev received the ball and advanced swiftly along the sideline, attracting the Beijing team's midfielders and defenders. Then, unexpectedly, he made a long pass to the left. The left winger volleyed the ball to center forward Sokolov. Sokolov gently pushed the ball into the net.

    When facing Beijing team's tight man-to-man marking combined with covering defense, the visiting team successfully utilized powerful long shots. When the opposing goalkeeper parried the ball, the forwards quickly caught up and took another shot, sending the ball into the net. The two goals scored in the second half were both scored when left inside forward Voroshilov and center forward Sokolov, rushed into the penalty area quickly when their teammates took long shots, and kicked the ball past the goalkeeper into the net.

    Although the Beijing Institute of Physical Education team was at a disadvantage throughout the match, they fought quite tenaciously. In the closing minutes of the first half and within the first ten minutes of the second half, they worked hard to push the ball into the opponent's half. The midfielders assisted the forwards in attacking, taking several shots, but because the shots were either inaccurate or weak, they either went out of bounds or were easily caught by the goalkeeper.

    Dai Linjing, a senior figure in the football community, said to reporters after watching the match: "The Beijing team has relatively poor basic skills, their passing and ball control are slow, making it difficult to penetrate the opponent's penalty area, and they cannot compensate for this weakness with powerful long shots. The Soviet 'Lokomotiv' team's proactive tackling and interception, fast passing and dribbling, and fierce and powerful long shots are all things we should learn from."   (Guo An)

    苏联火车头足球队六战六捷
    昨以四比零胜北京体院队
    本报讯　17日下午，来我国访问的苏联“火车头”足球队，在北京先农坛体育场对北京体育学院队进行了一场精彩的友谊比赛。经过九十分钟的激战，苏联“火车头”队又以四比零取得了胜利。这是他们来我国后的第六次胜利。
    苏联“火车头”队在进攻时，以右内锋布布金居后策应，给前锋制造空隙伺机射门。第一个球便是由布布金得球后以一下恰到好处的吊球，将球踢到禁区，四个前锋飞快地向门前冲刺；中锋索科洛夫在超过对方后卫一步时举脚射门，球急如矢，碰守门员的手弹入网内。这时离比赛开始仅一分半钟。
    第二个球是客队在远传和短传的巧妙配合下攻入的。在十八分钟时，客队右翼扎依谢夫在接球后闪电般地在边线推进，将北京队前卫、后卫引诱过来；然后出其不意地将球远传至左端。左翼凌空一脚传给中锋索科洛夫。索科洛夫轻轻地将球拨入网内。
    在对付北京队严密地人盯人结合补位的防守方法时，客队成功地利用狠劲的远射，在对方守门员将球扑出时，前锋飞快地赶上再补一脚，将球射入网内。下半时射进的两个球，便是由左内锋沃罗希洛夫和中锋索科洛夫在自己同伴举脚远射时，飞快地向禁区冲刺，在守门员的身旁举脚将球射进网内。
    北京体育学院队在全场比赛中，虽然居于下风；但是战斗相当顽强。在上半时快结束和下半时开始后的十分钟内，他们曾努力将球压至对方场内，前卫协助前锋一起进攻，几次射门，但因射出的球或者不准，或者软而无力，不是射出界外，便是被守门员从容地接住。
    足球界的前辈戴麟经在看了这场比赛后对记者说：“北京队基本动作较差，传球、停球动作慢，因此很难深入对方禁区，而他们又不能以狠劲的远射来弥补这个缺点。苏联‘火车头’队的积极主动抢、截球，快速的传球、带球和凶狠有力的远射，都是我们应该很好学习的。”    （国安）
