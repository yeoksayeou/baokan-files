Using his observations from inspections, Zhu Gengsheng illustrates that the vast majority of rural cadres are working diligently day and night. For the sake of the masses, they spare no effort, sacrificing their health and even their precious lives. They have shortcomings, but they do not intentionally turn good things into bad things. Some people completely negate their achievements and pour cold water on them; this attitude is incorrect.

First, please allow me to pay my highest respects to the Chinese Communist Party, which leads our country in its leap towards socialist society, and to the great people's leader, Chairman Mao!

I am honored to attend this National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), and even more honored to have been invited to participate in the Supreme State Conference, where I had the opportunity to hear Chairman Mao's brilliant and correct twelve instructions on handling contradictions among the people, as well as Premier Zhou's report on his visit to eleven Asian and European countries, Vice Premier Li's explanation of the Second Five-Year Plan, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the CPPCC, and the speeches of the committee members. These experiences have deeply impressed upon me the increasing consolidation and growth of the socialist camp, the growing prosperity and strength of the motherland, and the infinitely bright future of socialism. This further encourages me to love the motherland, love labor, and love socialism. I am determined to dedicate my life to the realization of socialism.

Now, I would like to offer my personal views on how to correctly treat grassroots cadres, help them overcome shortcomings and correct mistakes, and encourage them to work harder for the cause of socialism.

In the great socialist revolution, some grassroots cadres, especially those in rural areas, undeniably have subjectivism in their thinking, lack a democratic style, make decisions arbitrarily, and do not consult with the masses. In their work, they exhibit commandism, act crudely and rashly, and are eager for quick success. For example, in the Jiaxing area, some rural cadres, solely for the purpose of completing the task of increasing grain production, forced farmers to uproot the ginger they had already planted and plant rice instead, neglecting the development of diversified economies. Similarly, in promoting double-cropping rice, all those who transplanted rice according to the agricultural season generally increased production, but in some places, farmers were forced to plant even after the transplanting season had passed, resulting in very little grain being produced, turning a good thing into a bad thing. These shortcomings and errors are extremely undesirable and cannot be said to lack a certain degree of seriousness. It is absolutely necessary for all parties to offer serious criticism of these shortcomings and errors existing among grassroots cadres, in accordance with the principle of "blaming the worthy," and these shortcomings and errors must be corrected as soon as possible.

However, I believe that some of the shortcomings and errors of certain grassroots cadres should not be entirely their responsibility. Based on my observations of grassroots cadres during inspections in rural areas, more than 99% of them are working day and night, with no time or opportunity for learning. Some even go ten or fifteen days without seeing a newspaper, so their policy thinking often lags behind the needs of reality and the situation. The tasks assigned by higher authorities are often only given as a principle, and there are very few people to help them, so in order to ensure that the task is completed ahead of schedule and beyond the target, they do not carefully analyze the objectively existing actual situation, but act blindly based on their own subjective wishes. All of these things may be the main root causes of the shortcomings and errors they produce in their work. More seriously, higher-level leaders do not provide enough education or assistance to them, and non-Party people provide even less effective assistance.

I believe that the shortcomings and errors existing among grassroots cadres are, after all, only shortcomings and errors in their work style and methods. To be sure, they are not consciously trying to turn good things into bad things. Moreover, many rural tasks, such as agricultural collectivization, unified purchase and sale, and improved farming systems, are new tasks, almost all of which are being done while learning and progressing through exploration. Therefore, shortcomings and errors are inevitable. I believe that their work achievements are primary, and their shortcomings and errors are secondary. Moreover, their high degree of responsibility for their work and their strong revolutionary spirit are worthy of our learning. Many grassroots cadres are indeed persistently working in rural areas while suffering from illness. I remember that in the winter of 1955, when Mr. Yu Huancong, a member of the National People's Congress, and I went to inspect rural areas in Deqing County, we met ten rural cadres in just one township. Because they worked in the countryside for a long time, regardless of wind, rain, and mud, eight of them had contracted severe schistosomiasis or filariasis (one of them was the deputy county magistrate of Deqing County, who had contracted filariasis). At that time, we asked why they didn't go to treat such serious ailments, and they said that it was important to do their work well and they really didn't have time to see a doctor. The clothes they wore often hadn't had time to be washed for many days, and they often ate cold leftovers. But no matter how hard they worked, they didn't complain at all. They neither strive for fame in the court nor for profit in the market. They only know how to bury themselves at the grassroots level, faithfully and diligently serving socialism. During the flood season, many grassroots comrades, under the leadership of the local Party committees and governments, joined with the peasant brothers to brave the storm and stay up for several days and nights, fighting bravely on the dikes and in the torrents to rescue and drain the water, engaging in a desperate struggle against natural disasters. In August 1956, the twelfth-grade typhoon struck Zhejiang, causing mountain torrents and seawater backflow. Sixty-three rural cadres were gloriously sacrificed after being drowned by the flood while rescuing the lives and property of the people. In Xiangshan County alone, fifty cadres were drowned, and seven of the nine section chiefs of the Xiangshan County People's Committee were drowned. These tragic and moving historical facts, in which they gave their lives for the interests of the people, cannot but make us feel both moved and ashamed. However, some other people, including myself in the past, have seen some shortcomings and errors existing in individual rural grassroots cadres and concluded that all rural grassroots cadres are like this. They say that "grassroots cadres have made the countryside dark and gloomy, worse than before liberation," and that "the Communist Party is good at the intermediate level, but bad at the lower level," pouring cold water on all the vast number of grassroots cadres. Some people even become dissatisfied with the Chinese Communist Party and begin to doubt the superiority of agricultural collectivization when they see individual rural cadres with these shortcomings and errors. This kind of grasping at one point as the whole, only looking at shortcomings and negating achievements, regarding the non-mainstream as the mainstream, and dealing with problems in a one-sided way, should be deeply self-criticized. Some people also believe that grassroots cadres who have made mistakes cannot simply get away with a self-criticism and should be severely punished. In my opinion, it would be better to examine our own ideological viewpoints more closely. As for some non-principled, unintentional mistakes made by grassroots cadres, as long as they can humbly examine themselves and thereby be corrected, then that would be ideal. The People's Government's policy towards counter-revolutionaries is to treat them leniently and reduce or exempt them from punishment as long as they can confess honestly, no matter how many crimes they have committed. From this perspective, can it be said that we should simply adopt a policy of punishment for some non-principled, unintentional, temporary mistakes made by grassroots cadres in their work? Before I came to Beijing, someone reflected to me that many rural cadres believe that if they fail to complete their tasks, they will be criticized, and if they complete their tasks but have some deviations in their work, they will still be criticized by higher authorities, and society will be full of blame, and the peasants will also raise many opinions to them. Being slapped in the face on three sides makes them feel dejected, so they are now afraid to speak loudly in the countryside, which has had a considerable impact on rural work. This has become a serious problem that cannot be ignored. It should be pointed out that the great victories of various great movements since liberation, especially the great victory of the collectivization movement in 1956, which transformed the economic nature of the motherland for thousands of years and liberated the productive forces, are inseparable from the consistent efforts of the vast number of rural grassroots cadres under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. In our revolutionary family of 600 million people, rural grassroots cadres are the main force in our construction, the most precious wealth in our revolutionary family, and our close flesh and blood. Therefore, I believe that we should correctly treat rural grassroots cadres. For their shortcomings and errors, we should proceed from the desire to help, and through criticism and assistance, achieve the goal of correcting mistakes and improving work. We cannot simply pour cold water on them, which would affect their enthusiasm for work. Therefore, I suggest that the conference forward a request to the Central Committee to formulate a specific and feasible appropriate care system for rural grassroots cadres who have been working at the grassroots level for a long time (including all grassroots cadres in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, sericulture, transportation, culture and education, water conservancy, etc.), stipulate necessary learning time and opportunities for them, earnestly help them improve their policy and ideological level, and pay more attention to their lives and health, encouraging them to continue to work happily at the grassroots level for the socialist cause. In addition, I heard that the Central Committee has decided to transfer cadres to rural areas to strengthen the leadership of rural grassroots work. Vice Premier Chen Yun also clearly pointed out in his speech that conscientiously implementing the method of streamlining the upper levels and strengthening the lower levels is an extremely brilliant measure to ensure the healthy development of rural work, especially agricultural cooperatives, and to prevent deviations. Yesterday's newspaper published a moving typical example of Deputy County Magistrate Tian of Shaoxing County going to serve as a township head. Therefore, I also suggest that our democratic parties mobilize their main forces to go deep into the grassroots and into agricultural cooperatives to engage in grassroots production work under the conditions required by the government. It would be even better if we could, like the Zhejiang Provincial Political Consultative Conference, have some committee members regularly contact a cooperative or a factory on a fixed basis, systematically understand the overall situation, and provide specific assistance.

Finally, I would like to make a guarantee to the conference, which is that if the organization needs me to engage in production work in rural areas, I will definitely not be attached to city life, and I would be extremely happy to go to rural areas to learn the fine style of hard work and simplicity of rural grassroots cadres, and to learn from the peasant masses, and conscientiously do a good job in grassroots production work. I believe that only by going deep into the grassroots, contacting reality, and integrating with the peasant masses to engage in production work can one's own thinking be thoroughly transformed, can one be trained to become a true servant of the people, and can one be trained to become a true Marxist-Leninist.

Please criticize and correct the above opinions if they are inappropriate.

### 应该用什么态度来对待农村干部

    应该用什么态度来对待农村干部
    祝更生用他视察所见来说明：广大农村干部都在日夜辛勤地工作。他们为了群众，不惜牺牲自己的健康甚至宝贵的生命。他们有缺点，但并不是有意要把好事办坏。有人完全抹杀了他们的成绩，直往他们头上泼冷水，这种态度是不正确的。
    首先请允许我在这里敬向领导我们祖国跃进社会主义社会的中国共产党和伟大的人民领袖毛主席致一崇高的敬礼！
    我荣幸的列席这次全国政协会议，更光荣的被邀参加了最高国务会议，得以面聆毛主席英明而正确的关于处理人民内部矛盾的十二项指示，并听到了周总理访问亚欧十一个国家的报告和李副总理的关于第二个五年计划的说明；及陈叔通副主席所作政协工作的报告，以及各位委员的发言，使我深刻的体味到社会主义阵营的日形巩固和壮大，祖国的日益繁荣富强，社会主义无限美好的将来。这就更鼓舞我热爱祖国，热爱劳动，热爱社会主义。为着社会主义的实现誓愿献出我自己的生命。
    现在，我对于如何正确的对待基层工作干部，帮助他们克服缺点纠正错误，鼓舞他们更好的为社会主义事业而努力这一个问题提出我个人的几点意见。
    在伟大的社会主义革命过程中，有一部分基层工作干部，尤其是乡村基层工作干部，无庸讳言的在思想上存在着主观主义，缺乏民主作风，遇事独断独行，不和群众商量，在工作上存在着命令主义，粗暴蛮干，急于求功，例如在嘉兴地区有个别的乡村干部单纯的为了增产粮食任务的完成，就强迫农民把种好的生姜拔掉另种稻子，忽略了多种经济的发展。又如推广双季稻，凡是按照农时插秧的都普遍增产，可是有个别地方已经过了插秧时令还是强迫农民种植，结果稻子很少结实，把好事办成坏事。这些缺点和错误，不特造成农业生产上一定的损失，而且在群众中也引起了一种很不好的影响。这些缺点和错误的存在，是极不应该的，更不能说是没有它一定的严重性。各方面对于基层干部中所存在的这些缺点和错误，本春秋责备贤者之旨提出严正批评的意见，是十分必要的，而且对这些缺点和错误也必须从速加以纠正的。
    可是我认为某些基层干部所有的这些缺点和错误，不一定都应该由他们来完全负责。只就我在农村视察中所接触到的基层干部来看，99％以上都是夜以继日的在忙着工作，根本捞不到学习的时间和机会，有的甚至十天半月连一张报纸都看不到，因而他们的政策思想，往往就落后于实际和形势的需要。上级布置任务又多半只是交代一个原则，旁边帮助的人又很少，于是他们为了要保证任务能提前超额完成，就不去细致的分析客观存在的实际情况，只凭自己的主观愿望硬干。凡此种种，可能就是他们在工作中所产生缺点和错误的主要根源。严重的还是在各级领导对他们教育不够，帮助不够，我们非党人士对他们更少有力的帮助。
    我认为基层干部所存在的这些缺点和错误毕竟不过是工作作风和工作方法上的缺点和错误。肯定的讲，他们并不是有意识的想把好事办成坏事，况且农村有许多工作如农业合作化、统购统销、改进耕作制度等等都是新的工作，差不多都是在边做边学；边学边做，摸索前进。因此缺点和错误也就难免了。我认为他们工作成绩是主要的，缺点和错误是次要的，况且他们在对工作高度负责强烈的革命性这一方面是值得我们学习的。有很多的基层干部，的确是长期的抱着疾病，顽强的在乡村支持工作。记得在1955年的冬天我和全国人民代表俞寰澄老先生到德清县农村视察时，只在一个乡里所遇到的十个乡村干部，因在乡间不避风雨泥沙长期的工作，其中就有八个同志都久已沾染着严重的血吸虫病或血丝虫病（其中有一个是德清县副县长沾染了血丝虫病）。当时我们曾问，有这样严重的毛病为什么不赶紧去治，他们说，搞好工作要紧，实在没有工夫去看病。他们穿的衣服有的许多日子都没有工夫去换洗，有时吃的多是冷饭头。但他们不管怎样苦，都没有半点的怨言。他们既不争名于朝，又不争利于市，他们只知道埋头下层，无限忠诚的勤勤恳恳为社会主义服务。当洪水季节，更有不少的基层工作同志，在当地党委和政府领导下，和农民兄弟在一起冒着暴风雨，连着几天几夜都不困觉，在?埂上，在洪流中，奋勇的抢险排涝，与自然灾害作殊死的斗争。1956年的8月，十二级台风袭浙，山洪暴发，海水倒灌，乡村干部为了抢救人民的生命财产被洪水淹没而壮烈牺牲的达六十三人之多，只象山一个县里就淹死了五十个干部，象山县人民委员会九个科长就淹死了七个。他们这一种为人民利益付出了自己的生命可歌可泣壮烈的史实，怎能不叫我们又感动又惭愧？可是另外有某一些人连我过去也曾是这样，看到了个别的乡村基层干部所存在的某一些缺点和错误，就认为所有的乡村基层干部都是这样。说什么 “基层干部把乡村搞得天昏地暗，比解放前还不如”，说什么“共产党是上级少，中级好，下级糟”，在所有的广大基层干部的头上都泼上一盆冷水，甚至有的人看到个别乡村干部有了这些缺点和错误，就对中国共产党也会引起不满，对农业合作化的优越性也起了怀疑。这种抓一点当全面，只看缺点抹煞成绩，把非主流的看作是主流，片面的对待问题，检查起来是应该深自进行自我批判的。又有一些人，认为基层干部犯了错误，不能以检讨了事，应该从严惩办。以我看来，还是应从我们本身思想观点上多检查一下好，对基层干部一些非原则性的无心之错，只要他们能虚心检查从而得到改正，那就再好没有的了。人民政府对于反革命分子的政策，不管他已经有多少罪恶，只要能坦白交代即从宽处理，减免罪刑。这样看，难道说我们对于基层工作干部在工作上存在的一些非原则性无心的一时之错，就硬要采取单纯的惩办主义吗？在我来京之前有人对我反映，有很多乡村干部认为任务完不成要吃批评，任务完成了在工作上出了些偏差，仍然要受上级批评，社会人士也责难备至，农民也对他们提出许多意见，这样三面吃巴掌，弄得垂头丧气，所以他们现时在乡村连话也都不敢大讲了，因而使乡村工作已受到了不少影响。这已是成为一个不可忽视的严重问题。应当指出，解放以来各种伟大的运动尤其是1956年的合作化运动伟大的胜利，转变了祖国几千年来经济性质，解放了生产力，这是和广大的乡村基层工作干部在党和毛主席的正确领导下一致的努力分不开的。在我们六亿人民的革命大家庭里，乡村基层工作干部是我们建设的主力军，是我们革命大家庭里最宝贵的财富，是我们亲切的手足骨肉，所以我认为我们应该正确的对待乡村基层工作干部。对于他们所存在的缺点和错误应该从帮助愿望出发，经过批评与帮助达到改正错误提高工作的目的。不能只在他们头上泼冷水，影响到他们工作的积极性。因此我建议大会转请中央，对于长期埋头在乡村基层工作干部（包括农、林、牧、渔、蚕、交通、文教、水利等等所有的基层干部），也能像对知识分子那样特订一种具体可行的适当照顾制度，规定出他们必要的学习时间和机会，认真的帮助他们提高政策思想水平，更关心他们的生活和健康，鼓舞他们安心的在基层愉快的为社会主义事业继续努力。此外听说中央已决定干部下放向农村进军，以加强乡村基层工作的领导，陈云副总理在讲话中也明确指出认真实行精简上层加强下层的办法，这是保证把乡村工作尤其是对农业合作社健康的发展防止偏差一个极为英明的措施。前天报纸上已登出绍兴县田副县长去担任乡长动人的典型事例。所以我并建议我们各民主党派在政府需要的条件下，应调动主要力量深入下层，深入到农业合作社里去从事基层生产工作。再能像浙江省政协有若干委员固定的经常联系一个合作社或一个工厂，系统的了解全面情况，进行具体的帮助，这样做，那就更好。
    最后我向大会提出一个保证，就是，如果组织上需要我到农村里搞生产工作的话，我绝对不留恋城市生活，由衷的极为乐意到农村去，学习乡村基层干部艰苦朴素的优良作风，并向农民群众学习，认真搞好基层生产工作。我认为只有深入下层，接触实际，和农民群众打成一片来搞生产工作，自己的思想，才能彻底的得到改造，才能把自己锻炼成为一个真正的人民勤务员，才能把自己锻炼成为一个真正的马克思列宁主义者。
    以上意见是否有当，请各位委员各位同志批评和指正。
