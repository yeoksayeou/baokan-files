Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: A batch of medium and small factories are being built in the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture. These factories include the Tianzhu Machine Oil Pressing Factory, the Huangping Gypsum Factory, and four wineries, all of which are about to be completed.

After these factories are completed and put into production, the Miao and Dong people in Tianzhu, Liping, Rongjiang, Taijiang, Danzhai and other counties of the autonomous prefecture, which are lacking in oil and wine, will be able to obtain a sufficient supply of oil and wine.

At the beginning of liberation, the autonomous prefecture only had four dilapidated power plants. Now, all sixteen counties in the prefecture have power plants and rice mills, and six counties have wineries. Machine sawmills have also been established in Jinping, Jianhe, Lushan and other counties on both banks of the Qingshui River, which are rich in Miao fir. In the past, the Miao mountain area, which was considered desolate, now also has many iron smelting plants, coal mines, and a relatively large mercury mine. In order to gradually change the backward state of the Miao and Dong farmers in production, agricultural tool factories and fertilizer plants have also been established one after another.

　　黔东南苗族侗族自治州兴建一批工厂
    据新华社讯　黔东南苗族侗族自治州正在兴建一批中、小型工厂。这些工厂中包括即将完工的天柱机器榨油厂，黄平的石膏厂，和四个酒厂。
    这些工厂建成投入生产后，自治州缺乏油、酒的天柱、黎平、榕江、台江、丹寨等县的苗、侗族人民，可以得到充足的油、酒供应。
    自治州在解放初只有四个破烂的电厂，现在，全州十六个县都有了发电厂、碾米厂，六个县有了酒厂。还有清水江两岸盛产苗杉的锦屏、剑河、炉山等县设立了机器锯木厂。过去认为是荒凉的苗岭山区，现在也有了许多炼铁厂、煤矿，和一个规模较大的汞矿。为了逐步改变山区苗、侗族农民在生产上的落后状态，农具厂、肥料厂也陆续建立。
