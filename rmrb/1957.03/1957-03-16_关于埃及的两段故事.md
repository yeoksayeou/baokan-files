    Two Stories About Egypt
    Yang Xianyi
    Ancient China had frequent exchanges with countries in Asia and Africa during the Tang and Song dynasties, acquiring much knowledge about these countries. There were quite a few records about Egypt in the 12th and 13th centuries, found in Zhou Qufei's "Lingwai Daida" written in 1178 and Zhao Rugua's "Zhu Fan Zhi" written in 1225. Here, I only want to introduce two interesting little stories from "Zhu Fan Zhi" for your amusement.
    Zhao Rugua, who lived at the end of the Southern Song Dynasty, had never been abroad, but he heard some stories from foreign merchants. Egypt was then called "Wusili State," which is the Arabic name for Egypt. Cairo was also transliterated as "Qiye" according to the Arabic pronunciation, and Alexandria was translated as "Egentuo State" as a dependency of Egypt. The record did not mention the name of the Nile River, but only said, "There is a river with extremely clear and sweet water, the source of which is unknown; in years of drought, the river water in various countries all diminishes, but this water remains as usual, providing sufficient fields for farmers to cultivate, and this is the case every year." Regarding this river, "Zhu Fan Zhi" recorded an interesting legend: it is said that there is an old man in the Nile River, who appears from the water every two or three years. His hair is black, and his beard is white, and he only appears from the waist up, washing his face and trimming his fingernails in the water. If this old man shows a smiling face, the year will surely be a year of good harvest and few diseases; if he shows a sad face, the year or the next year will be a year of poor harvest and many epidemics. The origin of this legend is probably very old; there is a story of the "Old Man of the Sea" in ancient Greek epics, which is very likely from the Nile River in Egypt.
    In ancient times, people could only utilize the gifts of nature and could not change the natural environment. Rivers were of utmost importance to people's lives, so many myths about rivers naturally arose; this was also the case in ancient China. Today, people can transform the natural environment, and the Egyptian people also have plans to build the Aswan High Dam. This myth reminds us of the Egyptian people's plans to transform nature, and we also hope that the Egyptian people, who have already stood up, can completely shake off the shackles and traps of Western imperialism and build their own country even better. By then, the old man of the Nile will show a smiling face every year.
    Another myth is about Alexandria; this story also has some practical significance: it is said that in ancient times there was an extraordinary person named Cugeni, who built a high tower by the sea, with two warehouses at the bottom of the tower, one for storing grain and the other for storing weapons. The tower was two hundred zhang high and could accommodate twenty thousand people up and down. There was also a large mirror on top of the tower, which could see the invasion of foreign warships from afar, so the defenders could prepare in advance. Later, a foreigner came; he swept under the tower every day, and everyone relaxed their vigilance; one day, he suddenly stole the opportunity, stole the mirror, threw it into the sea, and then fled. From then on, Alexandria could not know the enemy's attack in advance.
    The origin of this story is also quite old. It is said that Alexander the Great of ancient Macedonia began to build this famous city. Although the description of the high tower is somewhat exaggerated, it is indeed based on facts; Cugeni is the Arabic name for Alexander the Great. There have been many similar records in ancient Western records about this treasure mirror. However, this story can also be seen as a fable today: the diligence and wisdom of the people are the treasures to defend their national independence; the people must not relax their vigilance against all foreign imperialist elements who are kind on the outside but harbor ill intentions on the inside; once the imperialist robbers find a loophole, the treasure will be stolen, and the security of the country will be lost. The Egyptian people have been fooled by Western imperialism in the past. Today, the Egyptian people have stood up, and American imperialism is using the Eisenhower Doctrine to deceive the Egyptian people with sweet words. We believe that the Egyptian people will raise their vigilance and not let foreign robbers steal their treasures.

### 关于埃及的两段故事

    关于埃及的两段故事
    杨宪益
    古代中国在唐宋时代就同亚非各国有过频繁的交往，获得许多关于这些国家的知识；在十二、三世纪间曾有过不少关于埃及的纪载，见于1178年成书的周去非的“岭外代答”和1225年成书的赵汝适的“诸蕃志”里。这里我只想介绍诸蕃志里两个有趣的小故事，聊供谈助。
    南宋末年的赵汝适，并没有到过国外，但从外国商人那里听到了一些故事；埃及当时被称为“勿斯里国”，这也就是埃及的阿拉伯名称。开罗城当时也按照阿拉伯字音译作“憩野”，亚历山大港则译作“遏根陀国”，作为埃及的属地。纪载里并没有提到尼罗河的名称，只说，“有江，水极清甘，莫知水源所出；岁旱，诸国江水皆消减，惟此水如常，田畴充足，农民借以耕种，岁率如此”。关于这条河诸蕃志里纪载了一个有趣的传说：据说尼罗河里有一个老头子，每两、三年一定从水里出现，头发是黑的，胡子是白的，只出现半身，在水里洗脸剔手指甲；这老头子如果面现笑容，这年必定丰收少疾病；如果他面现愁容，这年或下一年就要年成不好，多病疫。这个传说的来源大概是非常古老的；古希腊史诗里有“海老人”的故事，很可能也就是从埃及的尼罗河来的。
    古代人只能利用自然的赐与，而不能改变自然环境，河流对于人民生活又有极重要的关系，因此很自然就产生了许多关于江河的神话；我国古代也是如此。今天人民能够改造自然环境了，埃及人民也有了建立阿斯旺大水闸的计划；这段神话使我们联想到今天埃及人民的改造自然计划，我们也希望已经站起来的埃及人民能够彻底摆脱西方帝国主义的重重束缚和圈套，把他们自己的国家建设得更加美好。到那时候，尼罗河的老人就要年年面现笑容了。
    另一个神话故事是关于亚历山大港的；这个故事也有些现实意义：据说古代有异人，名叫徂葛尼，在海边建立了一个高塔，塔底下还有两座仓库，一个贮粮食，一个贮器械，塔高两百丈，上下可容两万人；塔顶上还有一个大镜，可以远远照见外国兵船的入侵，防守的人就可以事先作好准备。后来有一个外国人来了；他每天都在塔下打扫，大家也放松了警惕；一天，他忽然偷得机会，把镜子盗走，投到海里，自己然后逃走；从此以后，亚历山大港就无法事先知道敌人的进攻了。
    这段故事的来源也相当古老。相传古代马其顿的亚历山大王曾兴工建筑这座名城，关于高塔的说法虽有些夸大，但也确有事实依据；徂葛尼就是亚历山大王的阿拉伯名称。关于这个宝镜的传说，古代西方纪载里也有过不少类似的纪载。不过这个故事今天却也可以当作一则寓言来看：人民的勤劳智慧也就是保卫自己国家独立的宝贝；对于一切外表善良内心不怀好意的外国帝国主义分子，人民一定不能放松警惕；一旦让帝国主义强盗钻了空子，宝贝就要被人偷走，国家的安全也就失去保障了。埃及人民过去已经上过西方帝国主义的当，今天埃及人民站起来了，而美帝国主义又在用艾森豪威尔主义来甜言蜜语欺骗埃及人民；我们相信埃及人民会提高警惕，不让外国强盗偷走自己的宝贝的。
