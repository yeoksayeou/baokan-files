    Harmonious Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law
    By our reporter, Gu Ye
    In the late autumn of 1951, An Zhiyong got married and took Yu Mei from Kouquan Town in the mining area as his wife. At first, the family lived harmoniously. However, later problems arose. Wang Xiuzhen, Yu Mei's mother-in-law, noticed that Yu Mei was often unhappy, always pouting, and when asked what was wrong, she wouldn't say a word. One day, Zhiyong came home, also acting strangely, standing there silently with his head down. His mother asked, "Zhiyong, if you have something on your mind, spit it out; it will feel better if you do." Zhiyong shook his head: "Mom, if I say it, it will make you feel bad." His mother anxiously said, "If you don't say it, I'll feel even worse." Zhiyong stammered, "Yu Mei is demanding to divide the family. I don't want to, and I can't reason with her no matter how I try." His mother asked, "Why does she want to divide? Doesn't she know it will be difficult?" As she spoke, Wang Xiuzhen became upset.
    Seeing tears in his mother's eyes, Zhiyong revealed his final decision—divorce. But his mother said, "Absolutely not, Zhiyong. Yu Mei is young and must have listened to gossip. If she wants to divide, then divide. After separating, you can do whatever you think is best."
    As his mother expected, Yu Mei had indeed listened to gossip. After marrying into the An family, she met Han Zhengqing, a woman she had known before. Han Zhengqing said, "Yu Mei, you're so foolish. Living with your in-laws means more people and more chores, and you'll inevitably have more to do. If you separate, you only have to cook for your husband. Look how free I am." Yu Mei believed these words without analysis. Therefore, when she saw Zhiyong, she first talked about how leisurely Han Zhengqing was, and then started demanding to divide the family. Zhiyong repeatedly tried to persuade her, but she wouldn't listen at all, insisting that they couldn't live together. This placed a heavy burden on Zhiyong, making him worry all day long. One day, near the end of his shift, while moving coal chutes, he thought with dread, "Alas! As soon as I get off work, I'll have to listen to Yu Mei grumbling..." As the saying goes, you can't do two things at once. At that moment, his right thumb was crushed by the machinery.
    After listening to his mother's advice, Zhiyong did not divorce Yu Mei. The second year after their marriage—1952—they separated from his parents.
    The separation angered the family and did not make Yu Mei any more relaxed. She was busy all day, and attending meetings and study sessions caused her to neglect cooking for her husband and taking care of the child. At this time, she remembered the many ways her mother-in-law had helped her in the past. When she went to meetings and study sessions, her mother-in-law would take care of the child at home, and when she returned, the meal would already be prepared. She thought, "Why didn't I see these things in the past?" She asked herself, "Others live far away from their mothers-in-law, yet they still care about each other and invite them to spend holidays together. I live only a few steps away from my mother-in-law, and instead of showing her respect, I said things that hurt her heart." One day, while pondering these things, she suddenly thought of a question: "When I was a member of the Youth League, Zhiyong was still just a member of the masses; now Zhiyong is a Party member, and I'm still a member of the Youth League, and a bad one at that. What's the reason?" She remembered the many things Han Zhengqing had said, compared them to the many facts of her relationship with her mother-in-law, and finally realized, "Han Zhengqing's thinking is wrong. I was encouraged by her, so naturally I couldn't distinguish between good and bad. I single-mindedly wanted to be like her, to associate with lazy women. How could I not fall behind?"
    In the autumn of 1953, Yu Mei encountered another difficult situation. The leadership told her to go to a political training class to study. If she went, after paying for her food expenses, there wouldn't be enough money left for Zhiyong to eat in the cafeteria, and no one would cook for Zhiyong at home; if she didn't go, she would fall behind. She was regretting having demanded the separation, but Zhiyong said to her, "This is your fault. Now that there's a problem, you figure it out." She was even more ashamed and planned to give up going.
    Her mother-in-law learned about this from others and came over, saying, "You go study; Zhiyong can eat at my house." Yu Mei stared at her mother-in-law's back, blaming herself.
    At school, people were discussing how the families of workers could participate in socialist construction. Yu Mei finally understood how much harm family disharmony could cause. She thought: Zhiyong never had accidents before, but that time he suffered a minor injury. Demanding a separation offended her kind mother-in-law and upset her father-in-law. Since the separation, her father-in-law hadn't walked past her door on his way to work. Yu Mei said to herself, "If they're unhappy, accidents are bound to happen in production. I craved leisure and caused so much trouble!"
    Yu Mei was about to finish her studies. Zhiyong went to his mother for food money. That day, as soon as Zhiyong entered the house, he stuffed over ten yuan into his mother's arms. His mother quickly said, "Foolish child, what are you doing? If you want to pay for the meals, Mom thinks it's not enough." She thought for a moment and said, "Use this money to buy Yu Mei a floral dress and a new cotton-padded pair of pants." Zhiyong said, "Who cares about her? And buy her clothes!" His mother said, "That's not how you should talk. Yu Mei is young; can Mom still hold a grudge? The clothes still need to be bought."
    At Yu Mei's mother's house, the young couple met. Zhiyong told Yu Mei to go to the tailor shop to have clothes measured and said, "Mom doesn't want food money; she wants to buy you clothes." Yu Mei blushed and didn't say anything, but she was truly both ashamed and happy in her heart. She thought, "Doesn't my mother-in-law love me? She's even more thoughtful than my own husband." After measuring the clothes and leaving the tailor shop, Zhiyong said, "This time when you come back from studying, do you want to live together or stay separate?" Yu Mei said, "I wanted to live together a long time ago, but I'm afraid Mom is still angry." Zhiyong said, "Mom isn't like you."
    On the day they reconciled, Yu Mei was deeply moved by her mother-in-law's generosity. From then on, Yu Mei loved her mother-in-law from the bottom of her heart, respecting her as she would her own mother. Wang Xiuzhen loved her daughter-in-law, caring for her as she would her own daughter. The whole family lived happily together. In the spring of 1956, Zhiyong's younger brother, Zhitong, got married. Yu Mei and her mother-in-law discussed it and agreed that she would wear her old clothes and sew a few more floral dresses for her sister-in-law. The mother-in-law and daughters-in-law lived frugally, but they often discussed how to ensure that An Chengfu and his two sons could eat well and rest well when they returned from work, and even the four-year-old grandson understood this. Whenever Grandpa was resting, the grandson would sit in front of the door like a sentry, and when he saw children coming to make noise, he would quietly say, "Go away, my grandpa is sleeping."
    Thus, the old miner An Chengfu had not taken a sick day or a personal day in the past three years, and had not had any accidents at work, winning full attendance awards every year. His two sons also hadn't missed work for years. People in the mining area praised: The fact that sixty-year-old Master An hasn't missed a day of work in three years is inseparable from his wife's organization of a harmonious miner's family!

    婆媳和
    本报记者  顾页
    1951年的深秋，安志勇办了亲事，娶了矿区口泉镇上的玉梅。开头，一家子过得很和睦。可是，后来发生了问题，玉梅的婆婆王秀珍发现玉梅变得老是不大高兴，老是咕嘟着嘴，问她发生了什么事，她一声也不哼。一天，志勇回家来，也有些异样，他呆立在一旁，低头不言语。妈问道：“志勇，你有什么心事，往外掏吧，掏出来会痛快些。”志勇摇摇头：“妈，这事说出口，会叫您老人家难受的。”妈焦急道：“你不说出来，妈更难受。”志勇结结巴巴地说，“玉梅闹着要分家，我不愿意，我跟她七说八说都说不到一块儿去。”妈问：“干吗她要分，她不知道分了会有困难吗？”说着说着，王秀珍就伤心起来。
    志勇看见妈妈眼角挂着泪珠，向妈吐露了自己的最后决定——离婚。可是妈说：“使不得，使不得，志勇，玉梅年青，准是听了闲话，要分就分吧。分开了，你们觉着怎么好就怎么办。”
    不出妈妈所料，玉梅真是听了闲话。她嫁到安家以后，见了从前认识的妇女韩正清。韩正清说：“玉梅，你真傻，同公婆一起过，人多事杂，不作不作也作多了。分开了，光替男人作点饭就没事了。你看我有多清闲。”这些话，玉梅不加分析地都相信了。所以，见了志勇，先是说说韩正清怎么清闲，进而是吵着要分家。志勇再三劝告她，她却一概听不进去，一口咬定在一起处不下去。这给志勇加上了一个沉重的包袱，弄得整日忧愁不安。一天快下班的时候，他一边搬运煤的溜子，一边害怕地想：“唉！一下班，又得听玉梅嘟囔……”俗语说，一心不可二用，正在这时，右手大拇指被机器砸坏了。
    志勇听了妈妈的开导，才没有同玉梅离婚。婚后第二年——1952年，他俩同爹妈分居了。
    分居惹恼了一家人，也并没有使玉梅清闲。她整天忙得不可开交，顾了开会、学习，误了替男人作饭，又弄不好孩子。这时候，她才想起婆婆从前给她的许多帮助。那时她开会、学习，婆婆在家看孩子，等她回家，饭早作好了。她想：“这些事，过去我为什么看不见？”她反问自己：“别人离婆婆远远的，还相互经常牵挂，逢年过节都要接来一起过。我离婆婆只几步路，不说孝敬她，倒讲了些刺伤她的心的话。”一天，她在反复思考的时候，突然想起了一个问题：“我是团员的时候，志勇还是个群众；现在志勇是个党员了，我还是个团员，而且是个不好的团员。什么原因呢？”她想起韩正清说的许多话来，比了比同婆婆相处时的许多事实，这才省悟道：“韩正清的思想不对。我受了她的怂恿，自然分不清事情的好坏了。我一心想向她这种人看齐，去跟懒女人作伴儿，怎么不落后。”
    1953年秋天，玉梅又遇见一桩为难的事，上级叫她到政治训练班去学习。去吧，她带上伙食费走了，留下的钱不够志勇在食堂吃饭的饭费，又没人替志勇在家作饭吃；不去吧，自己还要落后。她正懊悔不该闹分家，志勇却冲着她说：“这是你的过错。现在出了问题，由你想法。”她更没脸了，只好打算不去了。
    她的婆婆从别人口里知道了这件事，跑来说：“你学习去吧，志勇到我家里吃饭去。”玉梅呆望着婆婆的背影，心里责备着自己。
    学校里，人们在谈论工人家属怎样参加社会主义建设的问题。玉梅这才懂得家庭不和睦，害处有多大。她想：志勇从来不出事故，那一次却出了个轻伤。闹分家，得罪了善良的婆婆，气坏了公公，从分居起，公公上班就不打她门前走了。玉梅对自己说：“他们心眼里不痛快，生产就难免出事故。我贪图清闲，闹了许多事啊！”
    玉梅快学完了。志勇找妈给饭钱。那天，志勇一进屋，把十几块钱塞到妈怀里。妈忙说：“傻孩子，你这是干吗？要说给饭钱，妈嫌不够。”她想了想，说，“你这钱，就给玉梅作一身花衣服，添一条新棉裤吧。”志勇说：“管她呢，还给她作衣服！”妈说：“话不是那样说。玉梅年纪小，妈还能记仇？衣服还是得作。”
    在玉梅她娘的家里，小俩口碰到一起了。志勇叫玉梅去缝纫店量衣服，并说：“妈饭钱不要，叫给你作衣服”。玉梅红着脸不说话，心里可真是又惭愧又高兴。她想：“婆婆不疼我？怎么比我男人还想得周到。”量完衣服，走出缝纫店，志勇说：“这回学完回来，愿意一起过还是分开？”玉梅说：“我早想一起过了，只怕妈还生气。”志勇说：“妈不像你。”
    重新和好的那天，玉梅被婆婆的宽宏大量深深感动了。从此以后，玉梅从心底里热爱着婆婆，对婆婆就像对自己的生母一样尊敬。王秀珍疼媳妇，对媳妇就像对亲生女儿一样关切。一家大小过的快快乐乐。1956年春天，志勇的弟弟志同结婚。玉梅同婆婆一起商量好了，自己穿旧的，多给兄弟媳妇缝几身花衣服。婆媳三人过的很俭朴，但却经常商量着叫安成富父子三人下班回来怎样吃好休息好，连四岁大的大孙孙也懂得这个。每当爷爷休息的时候，大孙孙像站岗放哨一样，坐在门前，见了小朋友来吵闹，他就悄悄说：“你们走吧，我爷爷睡觉呢。”
    这样，老矿工安成富在近三年来从没有请过病假事假，工作中也没有出过任何事故，连年得全勤奖。他的两个儿子，也是几年不旷工的。矿区里的人们赞扬道：六十多岁的安师傅三年不误工，跟他老伴儿组织了一个和睦的矿工家庭分不开！
