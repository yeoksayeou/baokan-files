    Tapping the Potential of Stockpiled Materials
    The supply of certain raw materials is insufficient in China's economic construction. In addition to the efforts of enterprises producing raw materials to increase production, and the efforts of units using raw materials to save, at present, after ensuring a reasonable turnover of inventory materials, fully tapping the potential of surplus inventory materials is also an important aspect of overcoming the difficulties of insufficient raw material supply and better carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy.
    Some people say that accumulated materials have been dealt with in the past few years, and last year the supply of raw materials was tight, and the stockpiled materials were "eaten up," and even a reasonable turnover of inventory could not be guaranteed. Where is there any potential to tap? This sentence seems to make some sense at first glance. However, the facts are not entirely the case. In the past, many departments and enterprises actively cleared inventory and dealt with a lot of accumulated materials, and achieved great results. The inventory of some departments at the beginning of this year was indeed less than at the beginning of last year. However, many departments originally requested a lot of materials, and then production and construction tasks were reduced, and there were more materials than needed. Taking steel as an example, according to the preliminary statistics at the beginning of this year, the steel inventory of some departments has increased by more than double compared with the beginning of last year; if the steel inventory of some departments is calculated based on the actual consumption last year, it can still be used for half a year. This situation is even more serious in many enterprises. One engineering company had an inventory of more than 12,000 tons of ferrous metals at the beginning of this year, which was more than double the beginning of last year. If calculated according to the actual consumption of this company last year, it can still be used for one year and eight months. It should also be pointed out here that these statistics are based on the summary of many units not having a clear picture of their assets and underreporting their inventory. The actual inventory is even more than this. Recently, state supervisory organs and economic planning, statistics, supply, and other departments at all levels, under the leadership of party committees and people's committees at all levels, have focused on inspecting the inventory of some production and construction enterprises. Many facts revealed in the inspection show that not only was underreporting widespread in the preliminary inventory of materials at the beginning of this year, but also the amount of underreporting was considerable. The amount of steel and timber underreported by some units was even more than their original reported number. Some departments and administrations also had this problem to varying degrees in summarizing and reporting.
    Under the atmosphere of tight material supply last year, many units wanted to buy and store more to be on the safe side. During the period when "barter" was popular, although some problems were solved at the beginning, and the situation of tight material supply was eased, many malpractices gradually emerged later. Many units, regardless of whether they needed it or not, seized materials everywhere, and some even snapped up and hoarded them as "capital" for exchange. Although the inventory of some enterprises greatly exceeded the reserve quota, they still felt uncomfortable because "what they need is not available, and what they have is not needed." Some materials are heavily stockpiled in this unit, while that unit is seriously insufficient, and even stops work waiting for materials. Due to the lack of variety of materials and the specifications not meeting the needs, many enterprises have to use large materials for small purposes and use high-quality materials for low-quality purposes. This has caused a lot of waste. Of course, in order to ensure the normal progress of production and construction, a certain amount of material reserves is necessary. However, the above situation tells us that there are still a lot of surplus reserve materials that are not needed or temporarily not needed in many departments and enterprises, and the potential of inventory materials is still very large.
    To tap the potential of surplus inventory materials, the first thing is to find out the inventory and to balance and regulate materials in a unified and reasonable way. Since 1956, after several inventory checks, some departments and enterprises have a relatively clear picture of their inventory. However, many departments and enterprises still have no idea how much they have. The preliminary summary of the inventory check of the Ministry of Construction Engineering on January 1 this year showed that the inventory of steel almost increased by more than half compared with the estimated amount in early December last year, and the original estimate was that there was a shortage of tens of thousands of cubic meters of timber, but in reality, not only was there no shortage, but there was still an inventory of more than 100,000 cubic meters. This situation also exists to varying degrees in the metallurgical industry and other departments. In the past, many departments and material supply organs in various places have done a lot of work in balancing and regulating materials, which has played a great role in national construction. Now, in the case of insufficient raw material supply and the excess and shortage of inventory materials, unified and reasonable balancing and regulation is even more necessary. However, in reality, many situations of unscheduled dispatch have occurred, and sometimes it is impossible to uniformly allocate some surplus materials. This situation has brought many bad consequences, causing a lot of material accumulation and waste, and artificially aggravating the difficulty of insufficient raw material supply. Some things that should and could have been done in the past have not been done because of this delay. Today, because many units do not have a clear picture of their assets, it has further affected the correct arrangement of the country's production and basic construction plans.
    The reasons for this phenomenon of unclear assets and unscheduled dispatch are very complicated and involve many aspects. However, the bureaucratic work style and departmentalism existing in the leadership of certain departments and certain enterprises are very important factors. Here, the prominent manifestation of bureaucratic work style is not knowing the situation. They only pay attention to reaching out to the state for materials, but do not pay attention to seriously managing and rationally using these materials; they neither calculate carefully and tap potential, nor do they go deep into reality, investigate and research, and solve problems. Therefore, when the lower levels cry out for insufficient materials, they also cry out; when the lower levels ask for more materials rather than less, they report it upwards without examination; when the higher levels cut their material supply plans, they cut them down without discrimination. They often only emphasize guaranteeing supply and rarely ask about material management. When the higher levels instruct them to check inventory materials, they do not seriously study and implement them. Some comrades even turn a blind eye to the accumulation and waste of a large number of materials and remain indifferent. The manifestation of departmentalism here is that they only care about themselves and do not care about others. When preparing material supply plans, they are afraid of asking for less, and when reporting inventory materials, they are afraid of reporting too much. For the convenience of their own units, they often grab materials regardless of whether they are useful or not, and some even hoard and speculate, or adopt the method of "inventory secrecy" and "layer-by-layer blockade" to prevent surplus materials from being transferred out; some bargain with the higher-level dispatch orders, or even turn a deaf ear. In order to avoid "standing out and showing wealth," they clearly have a surplus of materials, but they still clamor for insufficiency, and some even disperse materials, "empty the room and clear the field," and conceal them layer by layer when the state checks inventory materials. Especially since the material shortage last year, departmentalism has developed even more. This bureaucratic work style and departmentalism are major obstacles to tapping the potential of inventory materials and must be overcome and corrected.
    These phenomena also reflect that there are still many shortcomings in the current material production, distribution, and management system. For example, some material production departments cannot strictly produce according to the plan and adapt to the needs; the production and basic construction plans and the supply plans are not well connected in the programming procedure, and they are often changed, making the programming of the supply plans lack a reliable basis; the material reserve system is not sound enough, and the reserve quotas are still unreasonable; the material management institutions and the material distribution work cannot fully adapt to the objective needs; there are also some loopholes in the material statistics system; in particular, capitalist industrial enterprises have implemented joint state-private ownership in the whole industry last year, and the original method of directly applying to the state for allocation and regulating distribution by commercial organs in the market is no longer fully suitable for the current actual situation, and it has not yet been changed; and so on. These shortcomings have objectively brought many difficulties to the material supply work and need to be actively overcome and improved. Only by actively overcoming these shortcomings can we help strengthen the planning of material supply and minimize the unreasonable distribution of inventory materials.
    In order to fully tap the potential of inventory materials, at present, all industrial production departments, basic construction departments, and material distribution organs at all levels should further do a good job in clarifying inventory and balancing and regulating materials in the campaign to increase production and practice economy. All departments and enterprises that do not have a clear picture of their assets need to mobilize the masses to seriously check inventory and earnestly clarify their assets. And on the basis of further improving the reserve system, thoroughly identify which materials are needed by the unit, which are not needed by the unit, which are reasonable reserves, and which are excessive and premature unreasonable reserves, in order to overcome the phenomenon of not knowing the situation. After earnestly clarifying the inventory, the surplus materials should be quickly balanced and regulated reasonably between departments and regions. This is a more arduous and complex task, and it is hoped that the state material distribution organs and the material supply organs of various departments and regions will actively play their due role in this work. At the same time, it is hoped that the relevant departments of the State Council will earnestly study and summarize the problems existing in the material production, distribution, and management system and actively improve them. It is hoped that the state supervisory organs and the financial and banking departments will continue to strengthen regular supervision of these tasks. It is hoped that party committees and people's committees at all levels will continue to strengthen their leadership over this work and pay attention to educating the material-using departments under their jurisdiction on the overall concept, criticizing and correcting the bureaucratic work style and departmentalism existing in the leadership of certain departments, and removing obstacles in the progress of the work. It is hoped that employees at all levels will supervise the administrative organs of their units to check and correct the unreasonable use of materials and phenomena such as waste and accumulation at any time.

    挖掘库存物资的潜力
    我国经济建设中某些原材料供应不足。除了生产原材料的企业应该努力增产，使用原材料的单位应该力求节约以外，目前，在保证合理的周转库存材料之后，充分挖掘多余库存物资的潜力，也是克服原材料供应不足的困难，更好地开展增产节约运动的一个重要方面。
    有人说，几年来都在处理积压物资，去年原材料供应紧张，库存物资都“吃空”了，合理周转的库存都无法保证，哪里还有潜力可挖呢？这句话初听起来似乎有些道理。但是，事实并不尽是如此。过去，许多部门和企业积极清查库存，处理了许多积压物资，取得了很大成效。有些部门今年年初的库存物资比去年年初确实有所减少。但是，不少部门原来材料就要得不少，后来生产和建设任务削减，材料就多出来了。以钢材为例，根据今年年初普查统计，有的部门钢材库存竟比去年年初增加了一倍还多；有的部门库存的钢材如果以去年的实际耗用量计算，还可以用半年。许多企业中这种情况更为严重。有一个工程公司，今年年初黑色金属库存达一万二千多吨，比去年年初增加了二倍多，如果按这个公司去年的实际耗用量计算，还可以用一年零八个月。这里还应当指出，这些统计数字是在不少单位家底不清、少报库存的基础上汇总的，实际库存物资比这还要多。最近，各级国家监察机关和经济计划、统计、供应等部门，在各级党委和人民委员会领导下，重点检查了一些生产和建筑企业库存物资。检查中所揭发的许多事实，说明在今年年初库存物资普查中，不仅少报的单位很普遍，而且少报的数量相当大。有些单位少报的钢材、木材竟比他们原来的上报数还多。有些部门和管理局在汇总上报中，也不同程度地存在着这个问题。
    在去年材料供应紧张的气氛下，许多单位为了保险一些，都想多买多储。在“物物交换”流行的一段时间内，开始时虽然解决了一些问题，缓和了材料供应紧张的局面，但是，后来逐渐产生了许多流弊。不少单位不管自己需用不需用，到处抓材料，有的甚至抢购囤积，作为交换的“本钱”。有些企业虽然库存材料大大超过了储备定额，但因为“需用的没有，有的又不需用”，仍然感到日子难过。有些材料在这个单位里大量积压，那个单位却严重不足，甚至停工待料。由于材料的品种少，规格不适合需要，不少企业不得不大材小用，优材劣用。这都造成了很大浪费。当然，为了保证生产和建设事业的正常进行，一定数量的物资储备是必要的。但是，上述情况告诉我们，目前许多部门和企业中本单位不需要或者暂时不需要的超储备物资仍然很多，库存物资的潜力还是很大。
    要挖掘多余库存物资的潜力，首先要查清库存，并且要统一地合理地进行物资的平衡调剂。1956年以来，经过几次库存普查，有些部门和企业的库存情况是弄得比较清楚了。但是，也有许多部门和企业对自己到底有多少家底还是心中无数。建筑工程部今年1月1日库存物资普查初步汇总，钢材的库存量几乎比去年12月初的预计量增加了一半以上，木材原来预计还缺几万立方公尺，实际上不仅不缺，而且库存还剩十几万立方公尺。这种情况在冶金工业等部门也不同程度地存在着。过去许多部门和各地的物资供应机关，曾经做了很多平衡和调剂物资的工作，在国家建设当中起了很大的作用。现在，在原材料供应不足、库存物资此多彼缺的情况下，统一的、合理的平衡调剂工作是更有必要了。但是，实际上却产生了许多调度不灵的情况，有时候要统一调拨一些多余的物资也办不到。这种情况带来了很多恶果，造成了许多原材料的积压和浪费，人为地加重了原材料供应不足的困难。过去有些应该办也能够办的事情，因为这样耽搁下来了，没有办。今天，由于许多单位的家底不清，更影响了国家对生产和基本建设计划的正确安排。
    造成这种家底不清和调度不灵的现象，原因很复杂，牵涉到许多方面。但是，某些部门和某些企业领导人员中存在的官僚主义作风和本位主义思想，却是很重要的因素。在这里，官僚主义作风的突出表现是心中无数。他们只注意向国家伸手要材料，而不注意去认真管理和合理运用这些材料；既不精打细算，挖掘潜力；又不深入实际，调查研究，解决问题。因而下面叫喊材料不足，他们也就跟着叫；下面要材料宁多勿少，他们也不加审查往上报；上级削减了他的材料供应计划，他们就不分青红皂白地往下砍。他们往往只强调保证供应，很少过问材料管理。上级指示要普查库存材料，他们也不认真研究，贯彻执行。有的同志甚至对大量材料的积压浪费现象熟视无睹，无动于衷。本位主义思想在这里的表现是只顾自己，不管他人。他们在编制材料供应计划的时候，唯恐少要，上报库存物资的时候，唯恐多报。他们为了本单位的方便，常常不管有用没用，乱抓材料，有的甚至囤积居奇，或者采取“库存保密”、“层层封锁”的办法，不让多余材料外调；有的对于上级调令讨价还价，甚至置若罔闻。他们为了怕“冒尖露富”，明明材料有余，还要吵嚷不足，有的甚至当国家普查库存物资的时候，还要疏散物资，“空室清野”，层层隐瞒，逐级少报。特别是去年材料紧张以来，本位主义思想更有了发展。这种官僚主义作风和本位主义思想是当前挖掘库存物资潜力的重大障碍，必须加以克服和纠正。
    这些现象同时也反映了：目前在材料的生产、分配和管理制度上，还存在着许多缺点。例如：有些材料生产部门不能严格按照计划和适应需要去生产；生产和基本建设计划与供应计划在编制的程序上衔接不够，而且常常变更，使供应计划的编制缺乏可靠的基础；材料储备制度不够健全，储备定额还不合理；材料管理机构和材料分配工作还不能完全适应客观的需要；材料统计制度中也存在着一些漏洞；特别是资本主义工业企业在去年已经实行全行业公私合营，原来向国家直接申请调拨和由商业机关在市场上调节分配的办法，已经不完全适合现在的实际情况，而又未来得及改变；等等。这些缺点都在客观上给材料供应工作带来了许多困难，需要积极加以克服和改进。只有积极克服这些缺点，才有助于加强物资供应的计划性，尽量避免库存物资分布不合理的现象。
    为了把库存物资的潜力充分挖掘出来，目前各工业生产部门、基本建设部门以及各级物资分配机关，应当在开展增产节约运动当中，进一步做好摸清库存和平衡调剂物资的工作。凡是家底不清的部门和企业，有必要发动群众认真清查库存，切实摸清家底。并且在进一步健全储备制度的基础上，彻底鉴别哪些材料是本单位需要的，哪些是本单位不需要的，哪些是合理的储备，哪些是过多过早的不合理储备，以克服心中无数的现象。在切实摸清库存以后，对多余的材料应该迅速在部门和地区之间合理地进行平衡和调剂。这是一项更为艰巨复杂的工作，希望国家的物资分配机关和各部门、各地区的物资供应机关，在这项工作中积极发挥应有的作用。同时，对材料生产、分配和管理制度上存在的问题，也希望国务院有关部门认真研究总结，积极加以改进。希望国家监察机关和财政、银行等部门，继续对这些工作加强经常的监督。希望各级党委和人民委员会，继续加强对这项工作的领导，并注意对所属用材部门进行整体观念的教育，批判和纠正某些部门的领导人员中存在的官僚主义作风和本位主义思想，扫除工作进行中的障碍。希望各级员工对于材料使用不合理和浪费、积压等现象，随时监督所在单位的行政机构加以检查和纠正。
