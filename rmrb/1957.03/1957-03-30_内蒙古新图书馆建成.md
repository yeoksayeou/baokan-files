Xinhua News Agency Report: The Inner Mongolia Library building, located on the banks of the artificial lake in the People's Park of Hohhot, has recently been completed. On March 25th, the Inner Mongolia Library moved from its old site at the ancient Drum Tower to this new, elegant building.

The new Inner Mongolia Library building covers an area of nearly three thousand square meters. The new library has reading rooms for Mongolian books, children's books, periodicals, and science and technology books. A reference and research reading room has also been specially set up to facilitate the reading of books and materials by experts and scholars.

When the Inner Mongolia Library was established in 1950, it had only a few thousand books. Now, the collection has increased to more than 153,000 volumes. The collection includes valuable historical materials of the Mongolian nationality, works by famous Mongolian writers from the Yuan Dynasty onwards, and many books are handwritten copies and old woodblock prints.
