Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 1st: American Communist leader Eugene Dennis on February 26th sternly rebuked the U.S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee for its illegal subpoena against him. He stated that the committee has no right to investigate the peaceful assembly of the American Communist Party.

Following the conclusion of the 16th National Congress of the American Communist Party, the American ruling class attempted to launch a new persecution against the American Communist Party. The Senate Internal Security Subcommittee issued a subpoena to Dennis, demanding that he appear before the subcommittee to explain the situation of the American Communist Party's National Congress.

At the hearing, Dennis invoked constitutional provisions to refuse to answer some of the provocative questions posed to him.

In a statement read to the committee, Dennis said, "I firmly believe that, under the Constitution, neither this committee nor any other agency of Congress can investigate peaceful assembly."

Dennis said, "This applies equally to peaceful assemblies such as the conventions of the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Americans for Democratic Action, or labor unions."

Senator Hruska, who presided over the hearing, prevented Dennis from reading the second part of his statement, in which Dennis said, "Since political beliefs and associations are not within the jurisdiction of this or any other congressional committee, I strongly recommend that this committee, or rather a more appropriate congressional committee, immediately turn its attention to issues directly affecting the security of millions of Americans."

Dennis said, "I am referring to the bombings, vicious attacks, and acts of sabotage carried out by White Citizens' Councils against Southern Negroes seeking to enjoy their rights as Americans under the law. In this regard, I am also referring to the insidious activities of the chairman of this committee and certain other members of Congress - activities aimed at overturning the Supreme Court's desegregation decision and the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution. I am also referring to the conspiracy of the oil trusts to drag the American people into colonialist adventures in the Middle East and provocative 'police actions' like the one in Korea."

Dennis said: "These are clear and present dangers to the security and democracy of the United States, which any congressional committee concerned with security should immediately address."

The Senate Internal Security Subcommittee's more than one-hour investigation was defeated by Dennis's stern rebuke and was finally forced to announce a suspension of the hearing.

    抗议美国参议院一个小组委员会非法传讯
    丹尼斯严斥美政府危害美国的安全和民主
    新华社1日讯  纽约消息：美国共产党领袖丹尼斯2月26日在美国参议院国内安全小组委员会上严词斥责这个委员会对他的非法传讯。他说，这个委员会无权调查美国共产党的和平集会。
    在美国共产党第十六次全国代表大会闭幕后，美国统治集团就企图对美国共产党发动新的迫害，参院国内安全小组委员会向丹尼斯发出传票，要他到小组委员会去说明美共代表大会的情况。
    丹尼斯在调查会上根据宪法条款拒绝回答向他提出的一些挑衅性问题。
    丹尼斯在向委员会宣读的声明中说：“我坚决认为，根据宪法，无论这个委员会或国会的任何其他机构都不可以调查和平集会。”
    丹尼斯说，“不管是共和党、民主党、社会党、共产党、美国人民主行动协会还是工会的代表大会这样的和平集会，这种意见一律适用。”
    主持调查会的参议员赫鲁斯卡不让丹尼斯宣读他的声明的第二部分，丹尼斯在这一部分中说，“由于政治信仰和联系不在这个或任何其他国会委员会职权范围之内，我坚决建议，这个委员会，或者毋宁由一个更为合宜的国会委员会立即转而注意直接涉及数以百万计的美国人的安全的问题。”
    丹尼斯说，“我所指的是白人公民委员会对谋求享受法律所规定的作为美国人的权利的南方黑种人进行的轰炸、凶恶的进攻和破坏活动。在这方面，指的还有这个委员会的主席和某些别的国会议员的阴险的活动——这种活动的目的是要推翻最高法院的取消（种族）隔离的决定和宪法的第十三、十四和十五补正条款。我所指的也是石油托辣斯要把美国人民拖入中东的殖民主义冒险和像在朝鲜的那种挑衅性的‘警察行动’的阴谋。”
    丹尼斯说：“这些对于美国的安全和民主说来都是明显而现实的危险，是任何想要关心安全问题的国会委员会应当立刻挺身应付的。”
    参院国内安全小组委员会一个多小时的调查会在丹尼斯的严词斥责下遭到失败，最后只好宣布暂停传讯。
