Xinhua News Agency, March 5th Dispatch from Washington: United States State Department officials stated that they disagree with the proposal made by Indian Prime Minister Nehru that the United States and the Soviet Union hold direct talks to discuss their Middle East problems. They said that in view of the "progress being made" by the United Nations, holding such a meeting is "completely unnecessary."

Xinhua News Agency, March 5th Dispatch from Ottawa: French Prime Minister Mollet delivered a speech at a joint session of the Canadian Senate and House of Commons on the 4th, attacking nationalism in the Middle East, saying it is the best tool for so-called "Communist infiltration." Following this, he said: "Every crack in the front of the free nations in the Middle East will be exploited by the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is our responsibility to adopt a consistent and long-term policy in this region." He added that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is extremely important when dealing with the so-called "Soviet threat."

Mollet then promoted the idea of "European unity." He asked Canadian parliamentarians to "trust" this "European Common Market."

The day before, at a press conference held in Quebec, Mollet expressed his opposition to Nehru's proposal for a high-level meeting between the United States and the Soviet Union to resolve the Middle East issue.

    摩勒又叫嚷西方应在中东一鼻孔出气
    据新华社5日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院官员表示，他们不同意印度总理尼赫鲁提出的由苏美两国举行直接会谈讨论两国的中东问题建议的主张。他们说，鉴于联合国“正在获得的进展”，举行这样一种会议是“十分不必要的”。
    据新华社5日讯　渥太华消息：法国总理摩勒4日在加拿大参众两院联席会议上发表了演说，攻击中东的民族主义，说它是所谓“共产主义渗透”的最好工具。接着，他就说：“自由国家在中东的阵线的每一个裂缝都会被苏联利用。因此，我们的责任是在这个地区采取一项一致的长期的政策。”他还补充说，在对付所谓“苏联威胁”的时候，“艾森豪威尔主义”是极其重要的。
    摩勒接着鼓吹“欧洲统一”的主张。他要求加拿大议员“信任”这个“欧洲共同市场”。
    前一天，摩勒在魁北克举行的记者招待会上表示，他反对尼赫鲁关于由美国和苏联举行高级会议来解决中东问题的建议。
