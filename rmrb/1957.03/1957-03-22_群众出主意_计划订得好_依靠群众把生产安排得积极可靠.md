The masses offer ideas, plans are well-made
Rely on the masses to make production arrangements active and reliable

　　This newspaper reports that the preliminary production plan for the whole agricultural cooperative, formulated by cadres of the Bailudong Agricultural Cooperative in Huancheng Township, Chen County, Hunan Province in February, was considered too conservative by many cooperative members when it was submitted to them for discussion. As a result, the plan was revised, and the production increase targets were raised. The double-cropping rice planting area increased by 17% compared to the original plan, with an average yield increase of seven catties per mu; the average yield of single-cropping rice increased by nine catties per mu; the planting area and yield targets for other crops such as sweet potatoes, tobacco, and vegetables were also greatly increased. The total agricultural and sideline output value of the entire cooperative this year increased by 10.47% compared to the original plan, and 54.6% more than the actual income last year. This fact shows that agricultural cooperatives can only formulate positive and reliable production plans by fully relying on and mobilizing the masses, and absorbing the wisdom of the masses.

　　Last year, the Bailudong Agricultural Cooperative increased its rice production by 15.7%, and 91.3% of the cooperative members increased their income. Most cooperative members recognized the superiority of the cooperative, and their enthusiasm for increasing production and income this year is very high. The cooperative cadres did not fully estimate this situation, so although the area planted with double-cropping rice this year was 31.7% more than last year, it still could not meet the requirements of the cooperative members. For example, the Third Production Team planted 104 mu of double-cropping rice last year, and the cooperative cadres thought that increasing it to 130 mu this year would be about right. However, many cooperative members pointed out that as long as they learn from last year's experience and lessons, strengthen water conservancy management, increase fertilizer application, and repair the ditches, the yield can still be increased. As a result, the area planted with double-cropping rice by the entire team increased to 166 mu, and the average planned yield per mu also increased from 710 catties last year to 950 catties. For another example, at the general meeting of cooperative members in the Eighth Production Team, some people thought that the water conservancy conditions were not good, and that the single-cropping rice could only be planned for 450 catties per mu, while others thought that the cultivation was rough last year, and at least 400 catties per mu were harvested. This year, as long as careful cultivation and intensive farming are carried out, and more fertilizer is applied, 600 catties per mu can be achieved. After everyone's discussion, the average yield per mu was set at 580 catties.

　　In other production teams, the cooperative members also used their brains, tapped their potential according to the specific situation, and actively came up with ways to increase production. For example, most of the fields in the Fourth Team can grow double-cropping rice, but there is not enough labor, while the Fifth Team has surplus labor. The cooperative committee transferred some fields from the Fourth Team to the Fifth Team according to the requirements of the cooperative members, so that both teams increased the double-cropping rice area.

　　The revised production plan greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the cooperative members. In the continuous spring rain, the attendance rate reached more than 80%.

### 群众出主意　计划订得好　依靠群众把生产安排得积极可靠

　　群众出主意　计划订得好
　　依靠群众把生产安排得积极可靠
    本报讯　湖南省郴县环城乡白鹿洞农业社干部2月间初步制定的全社今年生产计划，在交给社员讨论时，很多社员认为太保守了。结果修订了计划，提高了增产指标。双季稻种植面积比原计划增加17％，每亩平均产量增加七斤；单季稻每亩平均产量增加九斤；其他红薯、烟叶、蔬菜等作物的种植面积和产量指标也都大大提高。全社今年农副业总产值比原计划增加了10.47％，比去年实际收入增加54.6％。这个事实说明，农业社只有充分依靠和发动群众，吸取群众智慧，才能把生产计划订得又积极又可靠。
    白鹿洞农业社去年稻谷增产15.7％，91.3％的社员增加了收入。大部分社员认清了合作社的优越性，今年争取增产、增收的积极性很高。社干部没有充分估计到这种情况，所以原计划今年种植的双季稻面积虽比去年多了31.7％，还不能满足社员的要求。例如第三生产队去年种了双季稻一百零四亩，社干部认为今年增加到一百三十亩就差不多了。但是很多社员提出：今年只要接受去年的经验教训，加强水利管理，增施肥料，把水沟修好，产量还可增加。结果，全队种植双季稻的面积增加到一百六十六亩，每亩平均计划产量也由去年的七百一十斤提高到九百五十斤。又如在第八生产队的社员大会上，有人认为水利条件不好，单季稻每亩只能订四百五十斤，另外却有人认为，去年耕作粗糙，每亩最少收了四百斤，今年只要精耕细作，多施肥料，每亩六百斤都可以达到。经过大家讨论，每亩平均产量订为五百八十斤。
    在其他生产队里，社员们也都开动脑筋，根据具体情况，挖掘了潜力，积极想办法增加生产。例如第四队的田大部分能种双季稻，但是劳动力不够，而第五队的劳动力有余，社委会便按照社员的要求，从第四队划出一部分田给第五队，使两队都增加了双季稻面积。
    修订后的生产计划大大鼓舞了社员的积极性。在春雨连绵中，出工率达到80％以上。
