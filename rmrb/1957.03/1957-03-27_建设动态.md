　　Construction Dynamics
　　Five Workshops of Chengdu Cutting Tool Plant Put into Production
    Xinhua News Agency reported that the milling cutter and reamer workshop, one of the key workshops of Chengdu Cutting Tool Plant, started operation on the 21st, producing the first batch of scribing drills, three-flute counterbores, angle milling cutters, and groove milling cutters for the plant. So far, five workshops of the plant, including tool manufacturing, machine repair, motor repair, and forging, have been put into production.
    The milling cutter and reamer workshop will produce more than 40 types of milling cutters and reamers, totaling more than 76,000 pieces this year, including the most precise 1 cm thick tenon reamers.
　  Main Building of Luoyang Thermal Power Plant Completed
    Xinhua News Agency reported that the main building construction project of Luoyang Thermal Power Plant has been basically completed. It took only half a year from the start of construction to the basic completion, shortening the construction period by three months compared to the original plan.
    Due to the improvement of construction technology and enterprise management level, the actual funds used for this project accounted for only more than 70% of the original planned investment.
    Since entering March, this thermal power plant has begun installing machinery and equipment. It is expected that the No. 1 Tractor Manufacturing Plant and other construction projects will receive electricity supplied by this power plant in the third quarter of this year.
  　Expansion of Xinjiang "August 1st" Steel Plant Underway
    Xinhua News Agency reported that the local state-owned Xinjiang "August 1st" Steel Plant is undergoing expansion. After the expansion project is completed next year, the output of pig iron, steel ingots, and steel will be doubled compared to the present, and some large and medium-sized steel products, light steel rails, and thin plates that could not be manufactured in the past will be produced. This can further meet the needs of basic construction and agricultural and pastoral production in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
