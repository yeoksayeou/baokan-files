　　“Production Reduction Plan”
　　Liu Bang
    In 1956, agricultural production in Dingxi Special District, Gansu Province, achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. In this area with a population of more than 2.2 million, the total grain output reached 2,006 million jin, an increase of 36.17% over 1955. This year, when setting production targets, the Dingxi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in accordance with the spirit of instructions from higher levels, proposed: basically maintain last year's production level, and on this basis, appropriately increase production. However, in reality, half of the twelve counties in the entire special district set production reduction plans. Not only did arid counties such as Yongdeng, Yuzhong, and Jingyuan set production reduction plans, but even Weiyuan, a semi-humid area with relatively stable annual output, also set production reduction plans. Of course, I don't know what "favorable" and "unfavorable" conditions these counties estimated when setting production reduction plans, but the process of Yongdeng County's Datong Agricultural Cooperative formulating and revising its production plan reveals some situations that may be useful for relevant departments to consider.
    Yongdeng County's Datong Agricultural Cooperative had a bumper harvest last year. When initially setting the production plan this year, the total grain output was only set at 4.2 million jin, a 2% reduction compared to last year. The cooperative members could not see the goal of economic prosperity, so their enthusiasm for production declined. They expressed their disappointment: anyway, "production has reached its peak," and even if we work harder, each labor day will only be worth 85 cents. From then on, some people preferred to bask in the sun on the streets and alleys, chatting idly, instead of actively working; the younger ones wanted to go to factories or find work elsewhere. This made the leading cadres panic. Later, with the help of the working group of the Dingxi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, they mobilized the masses to find ways to increase production. As a result, water conservancy projects alone could turn 3,000 mu of dry land into irrigated land, increasing grain production by 200 jin per mu. It was also discovered that there were 1,500 earth kangs that had not been dismantled for more than three years. If fully utilized, they could increase fertilizer by 4,500 cartloads, increasing the original plan of applying 4.5 cartloads of fertilizer per mu to 7 cartloads per mu. In addition, several measures to increase production, such as spreading sand to suppress alkali and improving soil, and promoting superior varieties, were found. After tapping these potentials, the Datong Agricultural Cooperative revised its production plan for this year, with the total grain output reaching 5.5 million jin, an increase of 27% over last year; the output value of sideline occupations could also be doubled compared to last year. The cooperative members' enthusiasm for production soared. They said: This time, not only was the plan revised, but also the thinking was revised. When we previously thought that "production had reached its peak," many ways to increase production were clearly in front of us, but we just couldn't see them!
    This is a matter worthy of deep thought! This reminds me of two questions: One is, in order to consolidate the already achieved bumper harvest results, is it better to put forward a higher production target that can continue to encourage the masses to move forward, allowing them to see hope, and is both active and reliable? Or is it better to put forward a lower target that can be easily achieved, but which obscures the masses' vision and frustrates their labor enthusiasm? The other is, were the units that have already set production reduction plans carefully formulated after seriously summarizing last year's production experience and tapping this year's potential for increased production? Or were they formulated under the constraints of this or that kind of thinking, although they generally calculated the accounts of increasing production, but did not do as the Party Central Committee required—to do everything possible to strive for a bumper harvest this year. These two questions are worthy of special attention from the leading comrades of those counties that have set production reduction plans; it would also be of great benefit if all counties in Gansu Province would pay attention to these issues.

　　“减产计划”
　　柳梆
    1956年甘肃省定西专区的农业生产获得了空前大丰收。二百二十多万人口的地区，粮食总产量达到二十亿零六千多万斤，较1955年增产36.17％。今年，在订制生产指标的时候，中共定西地委根据上级指示的精神，提出：基本上保持去年产量的水平，在这个基础上再适当地增产一些。但是，实际上全专区十二个县竟有一半的县订了减产计划。不仅永登、榆中、靖远等干旱县份订了减产计划，甚至像渭源这样属于半阴湿地区的常年产量比较稳定的县，也在订制减产计划。当然，我并不了解这些县订制减产计划到底是估计了哪些“有利”和
  “不利”的条件，不过，从永登县大通农业社订制和修改生产计划的过程中却看到一些可供有关部门参考的情况。
    永登县大通农业社去年丰收了，今年初次订生产计划的时候，粮食总产量只订了四百二十万斤，比去年减产2％。社员们看不到经济繁荣的目标，因而生产情绪低落了，他们失望地表示：反正“增产到顶”啦，再干，每个劳动日也不过八角五分。从此，有些人宁愿经常在街头巷尾晒太阳，聊闲天，不去积极干活；年轻一点的就想进工厂，或者到外地找事做。这样一来，领导干部也慌了手脚。后来，他们在中共定西地委工作组的帮助下，发动群众找增产门路。结果，仅修水利一项就可以把三千亩旱地变成水地，每亩能增产粮食二百斤。又发现有三年以上未拆过的土炕一千五百个，如果充分加以利用，就可以增加肥料四千五百车，使原来订每亩地施肥四车半的计划增加到每亩施肥七车。此外，还找到铺砂压碱改良土壤和推广优良品种等几项增产措施。在挖掘了这些潜力以后，大通农业社修改了今年的生产计划，粮食的总产量达到五百五十万斤，比去年增产27％；副业的产值也可以比去年增加一倍。社员们的生产情绪高涨了。他们说：这次不但修改了计划，同时还修改了思想。早先认为“增产到顶”的时候，许多增产门路虽然明摆在眼前，可就是瞧不见！
    这是一件值得深思的事情！这使我想起了两个问题：一个是，要巩固已经获得的丰产成绩，究竟是提出一个能够继续鼓舞群众前进，使他们看到奔头，既积极又可靠的较高的生产指标好呢？还是提出一个轻易可以达到，然而却遮拦了群众的视线，挫折他们的劳动热情的偏低的指标好呢？另一个是，已经订了减产计划的单位，究竟是在认真总结去年的生产经验，挖掘了今年的增产潜力的基础上慎重订出来的呢？还是在这样或那样的思想的束缚下，虽然也一般地算了算增产门路的账，但并没有做到像党中央要求的那样——千方百计地争取今年大丰收。这两个问题，是值得那些订减产计划的县的领导同志们特别注意的；甘肃省的各个县都来重视这问题，也会大有好处。
