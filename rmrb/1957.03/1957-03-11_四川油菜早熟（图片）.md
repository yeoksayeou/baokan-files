    Early-Maturing Rapeseed in Sichuan
    The river valley area of Miyi County in the Xichang Prefecture of Sichuan Province has a subtropical climate, and crops mature early. The early-maturing rapeseed planted by the Miyi County Farm blossoms and bears fruit in February. After the rapeseed is harvested, there is still time to plant double-cropping rice. This is a picture of farm workers spraying insecticide in the rapeseed field.

    四川油菜早熟
    四川省西昌专区米易县的河谷地带，属于亚热带气候，农作物成熟期早。米易县农场种的早熟油菜在2月间就开花结实。油菜籽收割后还能赶上栽种双季稻。这是农场工人在油菜田里喷射杀虫药剂。
