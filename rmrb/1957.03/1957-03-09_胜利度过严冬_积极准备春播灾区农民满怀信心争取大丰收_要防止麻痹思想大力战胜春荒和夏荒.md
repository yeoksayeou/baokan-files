　　Triumph Over Severe Winter
　　Actively Prepare for Spring Planting Disaster Area Farmers Full of Confidence to Strive for a Bumper Harvest
　　To Prevent Complacency, Vigorously Combat the Spring and Summer Famine
　　(Our Report) Farmers in areas of Hebei, Henan, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangsu, Hunan, and Jilin provinces, which suffered from floods, droughts, and typhoons last year, under the leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels, after several months of arduous struggle, have victoriously overcome the severe winter and are entering a busy spring production period.
　　The disaster relief work in various disaster areas has achieved great results in the past few months. According to statistics from the four special districts of Anyang, Shangqiu, Xinxiang, and Kaifeng in Henan Province, and the suburbs of Zhengzhou City, half of the more than 5,300 agricultural production cooperatives that were affected by the disaster have eliminated the famine, and the disaster situation in the remaining affected cooperatives has also been greatly alleviated. Hebei Province successfully completed the wheat sowing work last winter under very difficult conditions, with the province's wheat field area reaching more than 38 million mu. This is the highest record of wheat field sowing area in the province since liberation. In this way, the people of the province can obtain more summer grain. This province, which suffered the most severe disaster last year, has also made great achievements in sideline production. According to statistics, disaster victims have profited more than 100 million yuan from sideline production. The disaster victims in the Huaiyin Special District of northern Jiangsu Province, in the struggle against the winter famine, successfully completed the plans for water conservancy construction, winter planting, and sideline production. 700,000 people in the district were involved in the fight against water, completing more than 44 million cubic meters of earthwork, and both large and medium-sized projects exceeded their plans. The more than 10 million mu of wheat planted in winter are growing well. Disaster victims have profited a total of 4.44 million yuan from more than 30 kinds of sideline occupations.
　　Agricultural production cooperatives have played a huge role in overcoming the disaster. The agricultural cooperatives in various disaster areas, in the production and disaster resistance, uniformly allocated labor and animal power, and concentrated the use of funds, so that the disaster relief work in the disaster areas was done more and better. The state has also given huge support to the disaster area people's production for self-salvation. After the disaster occurred, the state allocated a large amount of relief funds, loans, and funds for repairing dikes and blocking breaches. 720 million jin of wheat and late autumn crop seeds, more than 380,000 tons of chemical fertilizers, and more than 2,760 tons of various medicines were transferred to the disaster areas.
　　At present, the preparation for spring plowing and the cultivation and management of overwintering crops in various disaster areas are being intensified. In the severely affected Xingtai Special District of Hebei Province, 5.52 million mu of wheat were planted last year, and it is planned to topdress more than 9 billion jin of fertilizer. The amount of fertilizer accumulated in the district has now exceeded 11.2 billion jin. At the same time, the work of hoeing, watering, checking seedlings, and replanting in wheat fields is also being actively carried out. More than 16.88 million jin of corn, cotton, peanuts, and other seeds needed for spring plowing in the Tongxian Special District of Hebei Province have been prepared. The spring plowing preparation activities in Shaoyang Special District of Hunan Province are even more intense. According to statistics in mid-February, the area of planked fields turned and dug in the district has reached 70% of the cultivated land area, and more than 250 million dan of fertilizer have been accumulated, creating favorable conditions for spring plowing. The areas of Henan, Anhui, and Jilin provinces that suffered from floods and droughts last year have shifted from winter water conservancy repair to preparing for spring planting. Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, which suffered a reduction in production due to disaster last year, has seen a high tide in preparation for spring plowing. Agricultural cooperatives in drought-affected areas are rushing to repair water conservancy irrigation projects, which will be completed in early March, and the drought resistance capacity can generally reach more than 50 days; agricultural cooperatives in lakeside areas are also stepping up the repair of dikes; in order to prevent insect disasters this year, many agricultural cooperatives have purchased pesticides and insect trapping tools; the county has accumulated more than 800,000 dan of fertilizer, and 85% of the early and middle rice fields have sufficient fertilizer. The people in various disaster areas are working hard with full confidence to strive for a bumper harvest this year.
　　Now, the time when the old crops are running out and the new crops are not yet ready has begun to arrive, and the problem facing the disaster areas is to prevent complacency and vigorously combat the spring and summer famine. All localities are rationally distributing relief funds and arranging spring agricultural and sideline production in accordance with the principle of thrift, and are paying attention to solving problems such as the difficulty of livestock feed.

    胜利度过严冬
  　积极准备春播灾区农民满怀信心争取大丰收
    要防止麻痹思想大力战胜春荒和夏荒
    本报讯　河北、河南、浙江、安徽、江苏、湖南、吉林等省去年遭受水、旱、台风灾害的地区的农民，在各级党委和政府的领导下，经过几个月的艰苦奋斗，已经胜利地度过严冬，转入繁忙的春季生产。
    各个灾区几个月来的生产救灾工作已经获得很大成绩。据河南省安阳、商丘、新乡、开封四个专区和郑州市郊区的统计，受灾的五千三百多个农业生产合作社中，已经有半数消除了灾荒，其余受灾社的灾情也减轻很多。河北省去年冬季在非常困难的情况下，胜利完成了小麦的播种工作，全省麦田面积达到三千八百多万亩，这是这个省解放以来麦田播种面积数字最高的纪录。这样，全省人民就可以获得更多的夏收粮食。这个去年受灾最重的省在副业生产方面也做出了很大的成绩。据统计，灾民从副业生产方面获利一亿多元。苏北淮阴专区的灾民在和冬荒斗争中，胜利地完成兴修水利、冬种和副业生产计划。全区有七十万人投入治水斗争，计做土方四千四百多万方，大、中型工程都超额完成了计划。冬种的一千多万亩麦子生长得很好。灾民从三十多种副业中共获利四百四十万元。
    农业生产合作社在战胜灾荒中发挥了巨大的力量。各个灾区的农业社在生产抗灾中，统一调配劳动力和畜力，集中使用资金，使得灾区的各项生产救灾工作做得又多又好。国家对于灾区人民的生产自救也给了巨大的支援。在灾害发生后，国家就拨出大量的救济款、贷款和复堤堵口经费。各地调往灾区的小麦和晚秋作物种籽七亿二千万斤，化学肥料三十八万多吨，各种药品二千七百六十多吨。
    目前，各地灾区的春耕准备和越冬作物的培育管理工作都在加紧进行。河北省的重灾区邢台专区，去年种麦五百五十二万亩，准备追肥九十多亿斤，现在全区积肥数量已经超过一百一十二亿斤。同时，麦田的锄土、浇水、查苗、补苗等工作也在积极进行。河北省通县专区春耕所需要的玉米、棉花、花生等种籽一千六百八十多万斤已经备妥。湖南省邵阳专区的备耕活动更加紧张。据2月中旬的统计，全区翻挖的板田面积已达耕地面积的70％，积攒的肥料有二亿五千多万担，为春耕准备了有利条件。河南、安徽、吉林等省去年遭受水、旱灾害的地区，已由水利冬修转向准备春播。去年遭灾减产的江西省南昌县，备耕工作已经形成高潮，受旱地区的农业社正在突击整修水利灌溉工程，3月上旬即可全部完工，抗旱能力普遍可以达到五十天以上；滨湖地区的农业社也在加紧培修堤防；为了防备今年发生虫灾，许多农业社已经购买了农药和捕虫工具；全县积肥已达八十多万担，85％的早、中稻田有了充足的肥料。各地灾区人民正在满怀信心地为争取今年的大丰收而努力。
    现在，青黄不接的时候开始到来，灾区面临的问题是防止麻痹思想，大力战胜春荒和夏荒。各地正按照节约的原则合理地发放救济款和安排春季农、副业生产，并注意解决牲畜饲料困难等问题。
