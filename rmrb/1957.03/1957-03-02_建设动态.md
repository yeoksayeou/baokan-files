Construction Updates

    Key Repair Work on the Bihe Railway Basically Completed

    This newspaper reports that after track laying on the Bi (Sezhai) He (kou) line reached Zhicun in October of last year, the line repair work from Zhicun to Hekou continued. Up to now, the work of overturning the ballast and raking the roadbed has been completed, and the repair work of medium and small bridges is nearing completion. Four of the five piers of the Baizhai Bridge have been completed, and more than half of the repair work on the No. 2 pier of the Hekou Bridge has been completed. A large number of steel rails and beams are being transported to the Bihe line along the route through the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to prepare for track laying.

    The railway soldiers repairing the Bihe line are implementing the policy of building the army diligently and frugally, and repairing roads diligently and frugally, and have widely carried out the movement to increase production and practice economy. Materials such as sand and rubble are obtained locally, saving more than one million yuan in sand alone. The scaffolding cost for bridge repair was originally planned to be very high. They used the terrain slope to minimize scaffolding and used it in rotation, using pulleys to deliver people and materials, reducing the cost by half.

    Construction of the Yili River Hydropower Station Intensified

    This newspaper reports from Kunming that the huge dam project of the Yili River Hydropower Station in the upper reaches of the Jinsha River is under construction day and night.

    The Yili River is a tributary of the Jinsha River with a large drop. The hydropower station is composed of four cascade power stations. The dam project is one of the control projects of the secondary power station. It is a key project before this year's flood and must be poured to a safe section of 2,078 meters above sea level before the end of April. Now the workers are excavating the dam foundation.

    The Yili River Hydropower Station is one of the five giant hydropower stations recently built in China. The effective capacity of the reservoir of the primary power station alone is equal to one-quarter of that of Dianchi Lake, and the volume of the dam is equal to nine times that of the Guanting Reservoir. After the Yili River Hydropower Station is completed, its power generation will be equal to ten times the total hydraulic and thermal power generation in Yunnan today.

    Factory That Saves Steel

    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 28th: A factory producing prestressed steel strand concrete components has been completed in Anshan, and today it produced its first batch of products.

    The main products of this factory are beams, columns, trusses, piles, and railway sleepers, which are widely used in industrial and civil buildings. These products are all prefabricated concrete components, which are prestressed and have better crack resistance than ordinary prefabricated concrete components. The use of this type of prefabricated concrete component can reduce steel usage by more than 50%. Calculated based on the factory's production capacity of prestressed steel strand concrete components, it can save more than 700 tons of steel per year.

    Prestressing reinforced concrete components is a new technology in China's construction industry. After Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation successfully tested it last year, Chinese engineers, with the help of Soviet experts, designed and built this factory. Now engineers have designed a variety of new products for this factory, including roof trusses with a span of 15 to 18 meters, trusses with a length of 24 meters, and crane beams with a lifting capacity of 50 tons.

    Recently, more than 50 departments, including the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Construction Engineering, have sent people to Anshan to visit this factory. Some departments have also borrowed design drawings and are preparing to build such factories.

    Qinghai to Open New Small Coal Mines

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Qinghai Province's local industries will use indigenous methods to open three new small coal mines this year and expand the production of existing coal mines to solve the local industrial and civilian fuel problems. Through these measures, it is expected that the province's coal production this year will increase by more than one-third compared with last year's actual output.

    Transportation in Qinghai Province is very inconvenient. At present, it relies on transportation tools such as cars and flatbed carts for transport. With the development of industry and resource exploration in the province, the population has increased rapidly, and the demand for coal has also increased significantly. If coal is purchased from other places, not only is the cost high, but the transportation capacity is difficult to solve for the time being. Therefore, in addition to continuing to develop the twelve small coal mines newly developed by various states and counties last year, Qinghai Province's local industrial departments have added the development of three small coal mines, including Wenquan Duoluo, and expanded the production of the original larger Datong and Yuka coal mines. This will not only meet the needs of industrial coal and agricultural areas, but also create conditions for the petroleum and geological exploration departments in the Qaidam Basin to reduce costs.

    Guizhou Builds a New Cork Factory

    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 28th: The new local state-owned cork factory in Guizhou Province officially went into production on the 19th. This factory can process more than 1,000 tons of cork bark per year. Its product, cork brick, is mainly used for sound insulation, heat insulation, and anti-corrosion.

    This factory is built in the main cork bark production area of Guizhou Province - Bijie area. In the past, the cork bark extracted by farmers here had to be transported to Shanghai and other places for processing. Due to long-distance transportation, the quantity and quality were greatly damaged. After the cork factory is built, it will not only reduce losses, but also save the country more than 20,000 yuan in transportation costs each year.

    碧河铁路重点修复工程基本完成
    本报讯  碧（色寨）河（口）线自去年10月铺轨到芷村后，芷村至河口段线路修复工程继续进行。到目前止，翻石碴扒道床工程已经作完，中小桥梁修复工程也接近完成，白寨大桥五个桥墩已经完成四个，河口大桥2号墩修复工程已完成一半以上。大批钢轨钢梁正通过越南民主共和国运到碧河线沿线，为铺轨工作作好准备。
    修复碧河线的铁道兵贯彻勤俭建军、勤俭修路方针，广泛开展了增产节约运动。沙子片石等材料做到就地取材，单沙子一项就节约一百多万元。桥梁修复的脚手架费用原计划很大，他们利用地形坡度尽量少搭，并轮换使用，用滑车送人送料，减少费用一半。
    以礼河水电站加紧施工
    本报昆明电  规模巨大的金沙江上游的以礼河水电站拦河坝工程正夜以继日地施工。
    以礼河是金沙江的一个支流，落差很大，水电站是由四个梯级电站构成的。拦河坝工程是二级电站的控制工程之一，它是今年洪水前的重点工程，必须在4月底以前浇筑到二千零七十八高程的安全断面。现在职工们正在开挖坝基。
    以礼河水电站是我国最近建设的五大巨型水电站之一。单是其中的一级电站，水库的有效容量就等于滇池的四分之一，水坝体积等于官厅水库的九倍。以礼河水电站全部建成后，它的发电量等于云南现在水力、火力发电总量的十倍。
    节约钢筋的工厂
    新华社鞍山28日电  一座生产预应力钢弦混凝土构件的工厂已经在鞍山建成，今天生产了第一批产品。
    这个厂主要产品是：工业和民用建筑上应用很广的梁、柱、桁架、桩和铁路上用的轨枕等。这些产品都是混凝土预制构件，因为它预加应力，比一般的混凝土预制构件更具有抗裂的性能。用这种混凝土预制构件可少用50％以上的钢筋。按这个工厂生产预应力钢弦混凝土构件的能力计算，每年可以节约钢筋七百多吨。
    在预制钢筋混凝土构件中预加应力，是我国建筑业的一项新技术，去年鞍山冶金建筑总公司试验成功以后，中国工程师们便在苏联专家的帮助下，设计和建造了这座工厂。现在工程师们已经为这个厂设计了多种新产品，其中包括跨度十五到十八公尺长的屋架梁、二十四公尺长的桁架和起重能力五十吨的吊车梁等。
      近日来，铁道部、建筑工程部等五十多个部门都派人来鞍山参观这座工厂，有的部门还借去设计图纸，准备建筑这种工厂。
    青海将新开小型煤矿
    据新华社讯  青海省地方工业今年将用土法新开三个小型煤矿，并且扩大原有煤矿的生产，以解决当地工业和民用燃料问题。通过这些办法，预计全省今年生产的煤炭将比去年实际产量增加三分之一以上。
    青海省境内交通甚为不便，目前都是依靠汽车、大板车等交通工具来运输。全省随着工业和资源勘探工作的发展，人口增加很快，煤炭的需要量也大大增加。如果从外地购煤，不仅成本高，运输力量一时也难解决。因此，青海省地方工业部门今年除了继续开采去年各州、县新开发的十二个小型煤矿外，又增加了亹源多罗等三个小型煤矿的开采，并且扩大了原来较大的大通、鱼卡两个煤矿的生产。这样不仅能满足工业用煤和农业区人民用煤的需要，而且给柴达木盆地石油、地质勘探部门降低成本创造了条件。
    贵州新建一座软木厂
    新华社贵阳28日电  贵州省新建的地方国营软木厂19日正式投入生产。这座工厂每年可以加工栓皮一千吨以上。它的产品软木砖，主要是作隔音、隔热、防腐等用的。
    这座工厂建设在贵州省栓皮的主要产区——毕节地区。过去农民在这里采剥出的栓皮都要运到上海等地去加工，因为长途运输，数量和质量都受到很大损失。软木厂建成以后，不仅减少了损耗，而且每年还可以为国家节约两万多元的运费。
