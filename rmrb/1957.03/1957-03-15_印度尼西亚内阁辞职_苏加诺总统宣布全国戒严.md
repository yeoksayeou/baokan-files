Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 14th: Indonesian President Sukarno accepted the resignation of the Ali Sastroamidjojo cabinet today and declared a state of war and martial law throughout the country, effective from 10:30 AM on March 14th.

The Sastroamidjojo cabinet decided to resign after a meeting held on the evening of the 13th. A communique issued after the cabinet meeting stated that the cabinet decided to resign because all efforts to reorganize the cabinet appeared to be ineffective.

The Indonesian Islamic League Party withdrew its two cabinet members before the end of the cabinet meeting. One of them, Deputy Minister of Agriculture Mahaban, told reporters that they withdrew from the cabinet because no agreement could be reached on some major issues, especially the comprehensive reorganization of the cabinet.

The Sastroamidjojo cabinet was the first Indonesian cabinet formed by universal suffrage. Since its establishment in March last year, the cabinet has faced various difficulties, and domestic and foreign forces have repeatedly created incidents in an attempt to overthrow it. The Masyumi Party, the Perti Islamic Party, and the Indonesian Independence Defenders League withdrew from the cabinet after the rebellion against the central government occurred in North Sumatra in December last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 14th: Jakarta Garrison Commander Major Dahyar announced on the evening of March 13th that any news directly or indirectly related to the military must not be released unless it comes from the Jakarta Garrison Headquarters or the Army Intelligence Department, otherwise the perpetrators will be prosecuted.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 14th: President Sukarno told many delegations supporting his plan on March 13th that he would announce the results of his consideration of the plan in a day or two.

President Sukarno has been considering the opinions of all parties on his plan for several days. The President said that since his plan was announced, he has received many delegations who support his plan. Of the meters-thick letters and telegrams he received, 95% expressed support for his plan.

According to the planned schedule, President Sukarno will deliver a speech at a mass rally in Medan on March 16th. Several hundred representative figures from various parties and groups in Medan are participating in the preparations for this mass rally, including members of the Masyumi Party, the Islamic Teachers Association, the Islamic League Party, the Christian Party, and the Catholic Party. At a preparatory meeting, they decided to convene this mass rally to support the Sukarno plan and oppose the establishment of an autonomous province in East Sumatra.

    印度尼西亚内阁辞职
    苏加诺总统宣布全国戒严
    据新华社雅加达14日电  印度尼西亚共和国总统苏加诺在今天接受了阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁的辞呈，并且宣布从3月14日上午十时三十分起全国处于战争和戒严状态。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁是在13日晚上举行会议以后决定辞职的。在这次内阁会议以后发表的公报说，内阁决定辞职，是因为进行内阁改组的一切努力看来都已经无效。
    印度尼西亚伊斯兰联盟党在内阁会议结束以前撤回了它的两名阁员。其中之一的农业部副部长马哈班对记者们说，他们退出内阁是由于一些主要问题特别是全面改组内阁的问题不能达成协议。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁是印度尼西亚第一次由普选产生的内阁。这个内阁从去年3月间成立以来，一直遭到各种困难，国内外的势力曾经接连地制造事件企图推翻这个内阁。马斯友美党、白尔蒂伊斯兰党和印度尼西亚独立维护者联盟三个党派在去年12月北苏门答腊发生叛变中央的事件以后，已经退出内阁。
    新华社雅加达14日电  雅加达卫戍司令达赫亚尔少校3月13日晚上宣布，凡是直接或间接同军方有关的消息，如果不是从雅加达卫戍司令部或者陆军情报处得来的，一律不得发布，违者法办。
    据新华社雅加达14日电  苏加诺总统3月13日对支持他的方案的许多代表团说，再过一、两天他将公布他对方案的考虑结果。
    苏加诺总统连日在考虑各方面对他的方案所提出的意见。总统说，自从他的方案公布以来，他接见了许多拥护他的方案的代表团。他所接到的厚达数公尺的函电中，有95％是表示支持他的方案的。
    根据预定计划，苏加诺将在3月16日在棉兰的群众大会上发表演说。棉兰有几百名各党派、团体的代表性人物参加这个群众大会的筹备工作，其中包括马斯友美党、伊斯兰教师联合会、伊斯兰联盟党、基督教党和天主教党的党员。他们在一次筹备会议上决定，召开这次群众大会是为了拥护苏加诺方案和反对在东苏门答腊成立自治省。
