Achievements of the Guangdong Provincial Political Consultative Conference in Implementing the Policy on Intellectuals
Xiao Junying's Speech

    I wholeheartedly endorse Chairman Mao's important twelve-point directive on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, Premier Zhou Enlai's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of the suggestions for the Second Five-Year Plan, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the Standing Committee of the CPPCC, and I will strive to implement all resolutions.
    Since the Party Central Committee convened the meeting on the issue of intellectuals, and Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a report on the issue of intellectuals, the Guangdong Provincial Political Consultative Conference, in order to implement this policy, has conducted registration, recruitment, and inspection work over the past year. I now report to the conference on the following:
　　Registering Social Intellectuals and Making Efforts to Help Arrange Work
    The Guangdong Provincial Political Consultative Conference established a "Social Intellectuals Work Office" in April last year to register social intellectuals with college degrees or above and representative former military and political personnel. Under the direct leadership of the Provincial Party Committee and with the strong assistance of relevant departments, the work was carried out smoothly, organizing them to study and providing appropriate relief and employment arrangements based on their specific circumstances. As of the end of December last year, a total of 1,717 people had registered, 653 had received relief, and 905 had been employed or recruited. According to incomplete statistics from the cultural, educational, and health departments, the province has absorbed 1,029 unemployed intellectuals to work as teachers. Registration, relief, and arrangements have also been made for folk artists and social medical forces. Preliminary statistics from Zhanjiang, Hepu, and Shaoguan prefectures alone show that 3,745 social doctors have been arranged for work. Professional theatrical troupes throughout the province have been streamlined and placed under the specific leadership of various prefectures, counties, and cities, arranging for "fixed time, fixed location, fixed route" tour performances. Over 600,000 yuan was distributed throughout the year for artist arrangements and relief expenses. In addition, more than 3,000 letters from intellectuals in various counties and cities in the province were processed. Organizing Systematic Study to Improve Political Awareness
    In order to improve the political and ideological awareness of social intellectuals, relatively systematic study was conducted. From the end of April to the end of June last year, three batches of study sessions were organized, totaling approximately 1,240 people. The principles adopted were voluntary, conscious, free, not pursuing history, and not investigating thought. Through this study, their sense of inferiority and decline was eliminated, and they felt that the Party and Chairman Mao shone on them like the sun, overcoming negative and pessimistic emotions, and initially raising their enthusiasm, making them see that they have an inseparable future with the cause of socialist construction. After improving their political awareness, some people voluntarily criticized their own selfish individualism and offered two jade artifacts they had found while digging graves in a work-relief team in 1951, antiques they had privately kept for several years (one was a jade disc, used to fasten strings on ancient weapons; the other belonged to an ancient sword decoration, both dating back 2,200 years). Some people also voluntarily confessed some historical issues.
　　Providing Relief to Intellectuals with Difficulties in Life
    It is not difficult to imagine that during long-term unemployment, they had to engage in other labor to make a living, and some suffered from poverty and illness, and had exhausted their possessions to make ends meet. Faced with this situation, we immediately took emergency relief measures to solve their current living difficulties. This not only stabilized their study emotions but also laid the foundation for strengthening their confidence in employment. At the same time, we also considered in our relief work that some social intellectuals maintained a so-called sense of self-respect and would rather endure hardship than request assistance – we knew the actual situation of several professors and experts, and immediately sent people to express condolences and deliver relief funds to solve their current difficulties; those who died due to serious illness were given burial expenses, and we were responsible for resolving their aftermath or helping their families find employment. A total of 653 people were given relief, accounting for 38% of the registered population. Intellectuals who personally experienced such warmth were therefore moved to tears and deeply realized the greatness and authenticity of the Party's policy.
    Party committees and governments at all levels and people from all walks of life have given a certain degree of importance to the implementation of the policy on intellectuals in their thinking, and have made improvements of varying degrees in specific measures. However, this has only remained at the level of relatively high-level organs and leading comrades, and has not been widely implemented in all departments and among general cadres. Therefore, we have encountered some difficulties in job placement. Currently, there are still more than 800 people registered in Guangzhou, because organs at all levels are responding to the central government's call to increase production and practice economy, and are streamlining institutions and reducing staffing, failing to place them as much as possible – resulting in an almost frozen state; but we believe that with the development of the cause of socialist construction, this will be gradually resolved in the future according to the needs of the country.
　　Organizing Inspection Teams to Inspect the Work of Intellectuals
    The issue of intellectuals in Guangdong, like the rest of the country, is as Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in his report: "Our intellectual forces, whether in terms of quantity, professional level, or political awareness, are not sufficient to meet the needs of the rapid development of socialist construction; and some unreasonable phenomena in our current use and treatment of intellectuals, especially the sectarian sentiments of some comrades towards non-Party intellectuals, are hindering the full发挥 of the existing strength of intellectuals to a considerable extent." In order to implement the Party's policy on intellectuals, the Guangdong Provincial CPPCC and the Provincial People's Committee jointly organized the "Higher Intellectuals Work Inspection Team" and conducted inspections in Guangzhou's South China Normal College, Shantou City, and Meixian County's hospitals and schools in September and October last year. At South China Normal College, more than 80 teachers and staff were interviewed; in Shantou City, 28 teachers and artists from four middle schools, 6 people from the science and technology community, 47 doctors from five hospitals, and 9 private practitioners were contacted; in Meixian County, 80 teachers from seven middle schools, 20 people from three medical and health units and private practitioners, and 10 social intellectuals were contacted. In total, more than 20 units were inspected during this inspection, and 290 intellectuals were interviewed. The leading comrades of the above-mentioned units in the three regions generally attached great importance to the reports and suggestions of the inspection team, and they all expressed that they would carefully study them as a reference for improving the implementation of the policy on intellectuals.
　　The Enthusiasm of Intellectuals for Work Has Been Increased
    In general, in the past year, all regions and units have given varying degrees of importance to the implementation of the policy on intellectuals, and have made some achievements in specific measures – such as the crude attitude of some district and township cadres towards artists, doctors, and primary school teachers has been criticized and educated. The political treatment and social status of intellectuals have been gradually improved. Many people in various regions and units have been absorbed into the Party and elected as representatives of the people or members of the CPPCC in provinces, cities, and counties. They have basically been given positions and powers in their work, and a large number of technical cadres have been promoted to leadership positions in various departments (the president and vice president of Shantou Hospital, the principals and vice principals of Meixian schools), greatly发挥 their enthusiasm for work. For example, the Department of Health – promoted 65 senior technical personnel in 1956, 22 well-respected traditional Chinese medicine doctors participated in the research of traditional Chinese medicine, and 1,283 traditional Chinese medicine doctors were absorbed into national institutions. Mathematicians and archaeologists who did general work in state organs were properly placed after being discovered, so that people could make the best use of their talents and develop their strengths. The relationship between Party members and non-Party teachers in universities has changed, and their interactions are closer than before. Teachers who have been found to have no problems have also had their hats removed from the period of the counter-revolutionary suppression and have been restored to their original positions; special care has been given to the lives of senior intellectuals – such as the purchase of oil and sugar, and public medical care. In order to take care of elderly teachers, two additional cars were allocated to each school. Teachers' working conditions have been improved, such as enriching library materials, and some schools have specially set up teacher reading rooms to ensure that five-sixths of the time is used for professional research. The Guangdong Provincial People's Committee also allocated funds last year to build the "Guangdong Science Museum" in Guangzhou (which can be completed in August this year) as a place for scientific workers to carry out activities and exchange work experience. In order to solve the long-term separation of teacher couples, the education departments of provinces, counties, and cities have transferred more than 4,559 middle and primary school teachers throughout the province to take care of their spouses and family relationships. Therefore, many teachers, doctors, and engineers have felt the care of the Party and the government for them, their enthusiasm for work has been increased, and their political demands have also been increased. Many people have also formulated plans to march towards science; but at the same time, some individual intellectuals have developed arrogant and complacent thoughts, clamoring for fame and status, and relaxing their own professional work, and have been criticized by the masses.

    广东省政协执行知识分子政策的成就
　　萧隽英的发言
    我衷心拥护毛主席关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾问题的重要的十二条指示，周恩来总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一个国家的报告，李富春副总理关于第二个五年计划建议的说明，以及陈叔通副主席关于政协常务委员会的工作报告，并为贯彻各项决议而努力。
    自从党中央召开关于知识分子问题的会议，周总理在会上作了关于知识分子问题的报告发表后，广东省政协为了贯彻执行这个政策，一年来曾经进行了登记、招聘和检查等工作，现在谨向大会报告一下：
　　登记社会知识分子，尽力帮助安排工作
    广东省政协于去年四月间成立一个“社会知识分子工作办公室”，举办大、专毕业以上的社会知识分子及具有代表性的旧军政人员的登记，在省委直接领导下，各有关部门的大力协助，顺利地开展工作，组织他们学习，并根据他们的具体情况，给予适当救济和安排就业。截至去年十二月底止，参加登记的共达一、七一七人，得到救济的六五三人，已就业或应聘的有九○五人。据文化教育卫生部门不完全的统计，全省吸收失业知识分子担任教学工作的一、○二九人，对民间艺人、社会医疗力量等，也进行了登记、救济和安排工作，仅就湛江、合浦、韶关三个专区的初步统计：安排社会医生共有三、七四五人。全省职业剧团进行归口挂钩，划给各专区、县、市具体领导，安排好“定时、定点、定线”的巡回演出工作，全年发放了六十多万元的艺人安排、救济费用。此外，还处理了本省各县、市的知识分子来信三千多件。组织系统学习，提高政治觉悟
    为了提高社会知识分子的政治思想的觉悟水平，曾经进行比较有系统的学习，计自去年四月底起，至六月底止三个月中，前后组织了三批的学习，共约一、二四○人。在方式上采取自愿、自觉、自由、不追历史、不查思想的原则，通过了这次学习，消除了他们自卑感、没落感，觉得党和毛主席好似太阳般照到自己身上，克服了消极悲观情绪，初步地提起了积极性，使他们看见了和社会主义建设事业有不可分离的前途。在提高政治觉悟之后，有的人自动地批判本人自私自利的个人主义的思想，献出他在一九五一年参加工赈队掘墓时，拾获的两个玉器，私藏了几年的古物（一件是玉碟，为古兵器作扣弦用的；另一个是属于古剑装饰品，都是二二○○年前的古物）。也有人自动地交代一些历史问题。
　　对生活困难的知识分子实行救济
    不难想像，他们在长期失业中，为了生活，不能不从事其他劳动，有些因贫病交迫，典借俱穷，难以度日。我们面对这种情况，即作出紧急救济的措施，解决他们当前生活上的困难，这样做，不仅可以安定他们学习情绪，并且可为坚定他们就业的信心打下基础。同时我们在救济工作中也估计到：社会知识分子中有些保持着所谓自尊心理，宁可忍受困窘，而不愿请求补助的——有好几位教授、专家，我们知道他们的实际情况后，即派人前往慰问和致送救济金、解决他们目前的困难；有的因病重而死亡者，均给予埋葬费，并负责解决其善后问题，或帮助其家属就业。总计救济人数六五三人，占登记人数38％。在这样亲受温暖气息的知识分子也因而感激涕零，深刻地体会到党的政策底伟大与真实性。
    各级党政和各阶层人士，对贯彻知识分子政策，在思想上已有一定的重视，而在具体措施上，也有不同程度的改进，但这只停留在比较上级机关和领导同志，而没有广泛地贯彻到各个部门和一般干部。因此，我们在介绍就业上，也就碰到了一些困难。目前在广州登记的尚有八百多人，因各级机关响应中央增产节约的号召，正进行精简机构，缩减编制，未能尽量安置——以致成为几乎冻结的状态；但我们相信：这跟着社会主义建设事业的发展，将来根据国家的需要，定能逐步解决的。
　　组织检查组检查知识分子工作
    广东知识分子问题，也同全国一样，正如周恩来总理在报告中所指出：“就是我们知识分子的力量，无论在数量方面，业务水平方面，政治觉悟方面，都不足以适应社会主义建设急速发展的需要；而我们目前对于知识分子的使用和待遇中的某些不合理现象，特别是一部分同志对于党外知识分子的某些宗派主义情绪，更在相当程度上妨碍了知识分子现有力量的充分发挥。”广东省协和省人委为了贯彻党对知识分子的政策，联合组织“高等知识分子工作检查组”，于去年九、十月间，到广州华南师范学院、汕头市、梅县的医院和学校进行检查。在华南师范学院访问了八十多位教师和职员；在汕头市接触过四间中学的教师和艺术界人士共二十八人，科学技术界人士六人，五间医院的医生四七人，开业医生九人；在梅县接触过七间中学的教师八十人，三间医疗卫生单位和开业医生共二十人，社会知识分子十人。总计通过这次检查的单位共二十余个，访问过的知识分子二九○人。上述三个地区各单位领导同志，对检查组的汇报和建议，大体上都很重视，他们都表示要细心研究，作为改进贯彻执行知识分子政策的参考。
　　知识分子的工作积极性提高了
    总的来说：一年来，各地区各单位对于贯彻执行知识分子政策，都有不同程度的重视，在具体措施上，都已经做了一些成绩出来——如一些区乡干部对待艺人、医生和小学教师的粗暴态度，已受到批评教育。知识分子的政治待遇和社会地位已逐步提高，各地区各单位有不少人被吸收为党员和被选为省、市、县的人民代表或政协委员，在工作中基本上做到有职有权，有大批技术干部被提拔为各部门的领导工作（汕头医院正副院长、梅县学校正副校长），大大发挥了他们工作积极性。如卫生厅——一九五六年提拔了高级技术人员六五人，有二二名有声望的中医生参加中医药的研究，并吸收一、二八三名中医参加国家机构工作。有在国家机关做一般工作的数学家和考古家，发现后便设法妥予安置，使得人尽其才，各展所长。在高等学校党员与非党员教师之间的关系有了改变，彼此往来，较前密切，经查明没有问题的教师，也摘掉了在肃反时期的帽子，恢复了他们的原职；对高级知识分子的生活——如购油糖、公费医疗等都作了特殊照顾，为了照顾老教师，每校加拨二辆小汽车。教师工作条件，已经有了改善，例如充实图书资料，个别学校也有特设教师阅览室，保证六分之五的时间，用于业务研究。广东省人委于去年并拨款在广州筹建“广东科学馆”（今年八月间可以建成），作为科学工作者活动和交流工作经验的地方。省、县、市教育部门为了解决教师夫妇长期分离的情况，全省互相调动照顾爱人与家庭关系的中、小学教师有四、五五九人以上。因此，许多教师、医生和工程师，感受到了党和政府对他们的关怀，他们的工作积极性提高了，政治要求也提高了，许多人还订出了向科学进军的计划；但同时，也有个别知识分子产生骄傲自大的思想，闹名誉地位，放松本身业务工作，而受到了群众的批评。（附图片）
