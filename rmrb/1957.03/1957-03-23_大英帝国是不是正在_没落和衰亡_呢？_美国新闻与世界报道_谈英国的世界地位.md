　　Is the British Empire Declining and Decaying?
　　——"U.S. News & World Report" on Britain's World Status

Editor's Note: U.S. President Eisenhower and British Prime Minister Macmillan began talks in Bermuda on the 21st of this month. It is said that this meeting is to "restore" and "strengthen" the "friendly and cooperative" relationship between the United States and Britain. British Prime Minister Macmillan recently spoke of the Anglo-American "alliance," saying, "A true partnership is built on respect," "We do not intend to part ways with the Americans, nor do we intend to be a dependency." But what is the American perspective? During the Bermuda talks, "U.S. News & World Report" magazine published an article on March 22nd entitled "Is the British Empire Declining and Decaying?" discussing Britain's current world status. The article pointed out: Britain "is falling to the status of a secondary nation"; "Britain is increasingly dependent on U.S. support to maintain its world status"; "and the United States will inevitably be in a dominant position in any partnership with Britain." Now, we have excerpted and translated this article below:

　　In November 1956, Britain took an action that may prove to be its last attempt to maintain its status as a world power. It moved to punish Egypt, which was once a British territory, and it ended badly.

　　Before the unfortunate failure of the adventure against Egypt, British leaders had clearly seen that the struggle to maintain the status of a world power was becoming a very heavy burden. The navy, which once dominated the seas, has now lost its former power and only a shell remains. British industry cannot believe that it is now unable to keep up in a race to manufacture increasingly powerful military aircraft. In addition to maintaining painstakingly crafted welfare programs, collecting taxes to maintain armed forces stationed in trouble spots around the world has strained income to the point of collapse.

　　The British must now face the fact and admit that in a world long dominated by them, they are falling to the status of a secondary nation.

		Estimating an Island

　　Now, according to estimates in domestic and world diplomatic circles, Britain's new status is that of an island nation—an island nation with an empire, but no longer a dominant nation on the sea, in the air, or on land.

　　This assessment shows that, geographically, the British Isles are small in area and very vulnerable to attack in this age of hydrogen weapons. In terms of maintaining some of the basic needs for the survival of its residents, these islands are self-sufficient in very few categories. Britain needs to import food, clothing fibers, fuel, and almost all the raw materials needed for industry.

　　In terms of defense, the British Isles are considered vulnerable in more than one respect. In both World Wars, Britain was only spared a successful submarine blockade with the help of the U.S. Navy. Today, after massive cuts, the Royal Navy is even less able to protect sea lanes. In the air, the Royal Air Force, which enjoyed the fame of the "Battle of Britain," is now just an empty shell, far behind the faster American and Russian jets. The latest American-made aircraft and American-made weapons account for a large proportion of the defense of the British Isles against attack.

　　In terms of financial strength, Britain is no longer as impressive as it used to be. The two World Wars (the funds spent in the early stages of both wars were mostly British resources) have consumed a large amount of wealth accumulated in this country over a century. Britain's overseas investment today is relatively small for a country that depends on trade for its livelihood. However, the pound sterling is still an important currency in world trade, and the British have a large number of international banking and insurance businesses in the non-Communist world.

　　In terms of industry, Britain is only a small country compared to the Soviet Union or the United States. In steel production, it has now also been surpassed by West Germany. But in many industries, Britain is still a center of the highest level of technology. In a fiercely competitive world, British industry suffers from strict rules laid down by Parliament, and these unions are single-mindedly trying to prevent modern methods and machinery from disrupting the original employment situation. This results in high costs, which further increases the difficulty for British industry to maintain its position in overseas markets.

　　In terms of people, the British are very strong in technology and ability, but the number is too small. In recent years, the total population has hardly changed, while the population of the United States and many other countries has increased dramatically. British industry and defense are also feeling the difficulty of a lack of manpower. In the twelve years since the end of World War II, defeated Germany seems to be running ahead more vigorously than victorious Britain.

　　Lost 489 Million People

　　Things were not always like this. A little more than half a century ago, Britain governed a colonial empire with a population of 563 million. By the end of this year, the population of this empire will be reduced to 74 million—most of them in Africa.

　　As this colonial empire declined, it was replaced by a federation of independent states. The original plan was for the federation to become a strong group under the leadership of the mother country, to maintain Britain's former world power status through its past colonies. Britain would lead foreign policy and joint defense. Britain's decisions would almost naturally be supported by its younger partners.

　　During World War II, when Britain took up arms, the Commonwealth countries helped it. India, then a major territory under British rule, joined in, providing many of the troops on which British strength depended.

　　The Suez Crisis Shows How
		Everything Has Changed

　　No Commonwealth country sent troops to assist in this adventure. Although the Indian army is now part of the Commonwealth forces, it has long been lost to London policymakers due to Nehru's "neutralist" and "anti-colonialist" policies. Canada, the most important and powerful of the Commonwealth countries, not only did not follow London, but actually voted against the mother country in the United Nations. Britain's former colonies in Asia did the same.

		Relying on the United States Today

　　The history of the last forty years shows that Britain is increasingly dependent on U.S. support to maintain its world status.

　　In both World Wars, the power of the United States guaranteed Britain's victory. These two wars consumed much of Britain's accumulated wealth. To help pay the huge expenses, Britain liquidated investments in many countries overseas. In both wars, the loss of manpower was enormous. German bombing caused significant damage to the British Isles.

　　In both wars, it was American industry, American forces, and dollars funded in the form of loans and grants that provided the insufficient strength for Britain to emerge as a victor rather than as a conquered nation.

　　Since the end of World War II, assistance has continued to be received from the United States. In fact, after the outbreak of the Suez Crisis and Britain was plunged into a fuel shortage, the United States urgently transported oil to Britain from the Western Hemisphere and also provided a dollar loan to help it pay for the oil.

　　In total, the United States has provided Britain with loans and grants totaling more than 37 billion U.S. dollars.

　　The two wars that the British won were the ones that the Germans lost. The losses suffered by Germany in terms of manpower, industry, and property damage far exceeded those suffered by Britain. However, it may seem strange that Germany has always recovered stronger than Britain after each war. Currently, the Soviet-occupied zone and the Western-occupied zones are almost evenly divided Germany; however, one part of Germany is still moving forward at a faster pace than the whole of Britain. It is West Germany that is advancing the fastest in Europe today.

			The Moment of Decision

　　British leaders are now facing a major decision. They must decide what direction their country should take to best suit its new status.

　　One path lies in taking some kind of "neutral" stance, which would probably involve dealing with Russia.

　　Although it may seem strange, there are people in Britain who would welcome such a decision, and they are not all Communists. Many Britons, situated on the Atlantic Ocean between the United States and Russia, feel more vulnerable to disaster than ever before. They have tasted enough bombing in their lives, and they fear that once a new war comes, missiles with atomic warheads will fall like rain on the crowded British Isles. Russia recently hinted, when demanding that Britain withdraw from Egypt, that it has the power to do so.

　　However, as long as Britain remains under the leadership of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and his Conservative cabinet, dealing with Russia is considered completely unlikely. Because for him, it would be a bit like Munich, and not a more effective guarantee of peace.

　　The second path that Britain can take is to develop a much closer relationship with the United States.

　　Many people in Britain still cherish the close ties between the United States and Britain during World War II. They believe that this connection is an invincible combination of Britain's experience and wisdom with the United States' strength and industrial talent. However, many Britons, out of pride, oppose any such connection in peacetime, considering it a big step towards becoming the forty-ninth state. Indeed, the United States would inevitably be in a dominant position in any partnership with Britain.

		Will the Defense Burden Shift?

　　A new partnership with the United States may be realized slowly, step by step. Some predict that Prime Minister Macmillan will propose the idea of the United States taking over some of Britain's defense obligations in Europe when he meets with President Eisenhower in Bermuda this week. Then, Britain can cut defense spending, and British industry can have more freedom to concentrate its efforts on exports.

　　The third possibility is for Britain to form a closer cooperative relationship with Western European countries.

　　This is currently considered to be a path that the Macmillan government is taking. Britain has probed France about the possibility of such an arrangement. After Macmillan visited French Prime Minister Mollet this month, he announced that Britain is exploring ways to get closer to its European neighbors. The governments of many European countries are already drafting plans to implement a "common market" plan, which involves establishing a free trade area (?) to pool their resources and operate together. This could also develop into something political.

　　Although Britain has expressed a desire to participate in such plans, it is said to be demanding privileges so that it can freely continue to buy food from around the world and maintain certain economic ties with the Commonwealth countries. Another question is: who will dominate the European group of countries. Britain may be reluctant to see Germany take the lead, but this is likely to happen as Germany continues to grow stronger at all times.

　　Therefore, of course, Britain may decide to reject all these possibilities and "go it alone"—not admitting that its strength and status have changed. But after everything that happened in Suez, such a path would be the most adventurous!

### 大英帝国是不是正在“没落和衰亡”呢？——“美国新闻与世界报道”谈英国的世界地位

1957-03-23
第6版()
专栏：外论摘要

　　大英帝国是不是正在“没落和衰亡”呢？
　　——“美国新闻与世界报道”谈英国的世界地位
    编者按：美国总统艾森豪威尔同英国首相麦克米伦已于本月21日在百慕大开始举行会谈。据说，这次会谈是为了“恢复”和“加强”美英“友好和合作”的关系。英国首相麦克米伦并在不久前谈到英美“联盟”时说：“真正的伙伴关系是建立在尊重的基础上的”，“我们不打算和美国人分道扬镖，也不打算做附庸国”。但是，美国方面的看法是怎样的呢？正在百慕大会谈的期间，“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志在3月22日发表的“大英帝国是不是正在‘没落和衰亡’呢？”一文，论述了目前英国的世界地位。这篇文章指出：英国“正在降到次要国家的地位”；“英国为了维持世界地位，越来越有必要依赖美国的支持”；“而美国必然会在与英国的任何合伙关系中处于统治地位”。现在，我们把这篇文章摘译发表在下面：
    1956年11月，英国采取了一种行动，这种行动可能会证明是它要保持一个世界强国的身分的最后尝试。它动手惩戒曾经是英国属地的埃及，结果弄得很糟糕。
    在对埃及进行的冒险不幸失败以前，英国的领导人物早已很清楚地看出来，为了维持世界大国的地位而进行的斗争正在变成十分沉重的负担。海军曾经一度称霸海上，现在却已经丧失了当年的威力而仅存躯壳了。英国的工业想不到自己今天竟然无力在一场制造威力越来越大的军用飞机的竞赛中不落人后。在维持苦心制订出来的福利计划以外，还要征收赋税来维持驻在全世界各个多事之区的武装部队，因此就使收入拮据到快要垮台的地步。
    英国人现在不得不面对事实而承认，在长期由他们称霸的这个世界中，他们正在降到次要国家的地位。
            估计一个岛屿
    现在照国内和世界各地外交界的估计，英国的新地位就是一个岛国的地位——这是一个拥有一个帝国，但是已经不再是海上、空中或陆地的统治国家的岛国。
    这种估计说明：就地理上来说，不列颠群岛面积很小，在现在这个氢武器时代非常易于遭到攻击。在维持居民生存的一些基本需求方面，这些岛屿很少有几类是能够自给自足的。英国需要进口粮食，衣着用的纤维，燃料，以及工业所需要的几乎全部原料。
    就防御方面来说，英伦三岛在不止一个方面都被认为是易于受攻击的。在两次世界大战中，英国完全是靠了美国海军的帮助才能免于遭受成功的潜水艇封锁。今天，皇家海军在大量裁减以后甚至更没有能力保护海路了。在空中，享有“不列颠之战”盛名的皇家空军现在光留下了一个空架子，已经大大落在速度更快的美国喷气机和俄国喷气机后面。最新式的美制飞机和美制武器在英伦三岛对付袭击的防务中占了很大的比例。
    就财政力量来说，英国已经不再像过去那样给人以深刻印象了。两次世界大战（两次战争初期所耗费的资金大部分是英国资源）已经消耗了这个国家一个世纪中积累起来的大量财富。英国今天在海外的投资，对于一个依赖贸易为生的国家来说是比较小的。可是，英镑仍然是世界贸易上一种重要的货币，并且英国人在非共产党世界中有大量的国际银行事业和国际保险事业。
    就工业来说，和苏联或者美国比较起来，英国只是一个小国家。在钢铁生产上，它现在同样已经被西德超过。但是在许多种工业方面，英国仍然是技术水平最高的中心。在进行着激烈竞争的世界上，英国的工业由于国会规定的严格规则而受到损失，这些工会一心一意想设法使得现代化的方法和机械不要打乱原来的就业状况。由此成本很高，这更增加了英国工业在维持它在海外市场中的地位的困难。
    就人民来说，英国人在技术和能力上是很强的，但是人数太少。在最近几年，人口总数差不多没有什么变化，而美国和其他许多国家的人口却有了飞跃的增加。英国的工业和国防同样感受到人力缺乏的困难。在第二次世界大战后的十二年，战败了的德国似乎正在以比胜利的英国更加生气勃勃地跑到前面去。
    失去了四亿八千九百万人
    事情并不是一向都是这样。半世纪多一点以前，英国曾经治理一个拥有五亿六千三百万人口的殖民帝国。到今年年底，这个帝国的人口将减少到七千四百万——其中大部分在非洲。
    这个殖民帝国随着它的没落，被由一些独立国家组成的联邦所代替。原来的打算是让联邦成为在母国领导下的强大的集团，以保持英国以前通过过去的殖民地保有的世界强国地位。英国会领导外交政策和共同防御。英国的决定会差不多自然而然地得到它的年幼的伙伴们的支持。
    第二次世界大战中，当英国拿起武器的时候，英联邦国家都帮助它。当时是英国统治下的主要领地的印度参加进来，提供了英国的力量所依赖的许多军队。
    苏伊士危机表明事情是怎样
            全部改观
    没有一个英联邦国家派遣军队在这个冒险中助一臂之力。印度军队虽然现在是英联邦部队的一部分，但是由于尼赫鲁的“中立主义的”和“反殖民主义的”政策，对于伦敦政策制订者来说，老早就失掉了。在英联邦国家中最重要、最强大的加拿大不但不跟着伦敦走，实际上在联合国里投票反对母国。英国以前在亚洲的殖民地也都这样做了。
          今天依靠美国
    最近四十年的历史说明，英国为了维持世界地位，越来越有必要依赖美国的支持了。
    在两次世界大战中，结局都是美国的力量保证了英国的胜利。这两次大战使英国消耗了许多累积的财富。为了帮助付清巨额费用，英国清算了在海外许多国家中的投资。在两次大战中，人力的损失都很浩大。德国的轰炸使英国本土诸岛受到重大损失。
    在两次战争中都是美国的工业、美国的兵力和以借款和赠款形式资助的美元提供了不足的力量，使英国能够以胜利者身分而不是以被征服者的身分出现。
    在第二次世界大战结束以来，从美国方面继续得到了援助。事实上，在苏伊士危机爆发、英国陷入燃料不足的困境以后，美国就从西半球紧急运输石油到英国，并且还提供了一笔美元贷款，帮助它支付石油价款。
    总计，美国对英国提供了总数三百七十亿美元以上的贷款和赠款。
    英国人打胜的那两次大战，打败仗的是德国人。德国在人力和工业、财产的破坏方面所受到的损失远远超过了英国所受到的损失。然而，看来可能很奇怪，每次大战以后德国总是比英国恢复得更加强大。当前，苏占区和西方占领区差不多平分了德国；可是，德国的一个部分还是比整个英国更加大踏步地在前进。今天在欧洲前进得最快的正是西德。
              决定的时刻
    英国领袖们现在正面临着一个重大的决定。他们必须决定他们的国家应该采取什么方向才能最适合它的新地位。
    一条路是在于采取某种“中立的”立场，这种立场大概要牵涉到同俄国打交道。
    虽然看起来可能很奇怪，但是在英国却有着那些会欢迎这样一种决定的人，而他们并不都是共产党人。有许多英国人由于处于美国和俄国之间的大西洋上，感到从来没有像现在这样容易招致灾祸。他们一生中已经尝够了轰炸的味道，他们害怕一旦新的战争到来，装有原子弹头的导弹就会像雨点般地落到拥挤的英伦列岛上。俄国最近在要求英国撤出埃及的时候曾经暗示说，它有这样做的力量。
    但是，只要英国仍然是在哈罗德·麦克米伦首相和他的保守党内阁的领导之下，同俄国打交道就被认为是完全不像会有的事。因为对于他来说，这就有点慕尼黑的味道，并且也不是一个较为有效的和平保证。
    英国可以走的第二条路，就是同美国发展一种更为密切得多的关系。
    英国还有不少人仍旧在留念着第二次世界大战期间美英两国之间的紧密联系。他们认为，这种联系是英国的经验和智慧的一种不可战胜的联合跟美国的力量和工业才能相结合的东西。但是，也有很多英国人在骄傲之余反对在和平时期也搞任何这类的联系，认为这是在变成第四十九州方面的一大步。的确，美国必然会在与英国的任何合伙关系中处于统治地位的。
        防务负担会转移吗？
    与美国的新的合伙关系可能要一点一点地慢慢儿实现。有人预测，麦克米伦首相本星期在百慕大与艾森豪威尔总统会谈时将提出由美国来负担英国在欧洲的一些防务义务的主意。然后，英国就能削减防务费用，英国工业可以有更多的自由集中力量于出口方面。
    第三种可能性是：英国与西欧国家结成更紧密的合作关系。
    这在目前看来，被认为是麦克米伦政府正在走的一条路。英国已经向法国试探进行这类安排的可能性。麦克米伦在本月间访问过法国的摩勒总理以后宣布，英国正在探求更加接近它的欧洲邻国的方法。许多欧洲国家的政府已经在拟订实现一个“共同市场”方案的计划，它牵涉到设立一种自由贸易地区（？），把它们自己的资源汇集拢来共同经营。这也可以发展成为一种政治性的东西。
    虽然英国表示想要参加这类计划，但是据说它要求享有特权，这样它可以自由地继续从世界各地购买粮食，并且跟联邦国家保持某种经济联系。还有一个问题是：谁将在欧洲国家集团中占统治地位。英国可能不乐意看到德国来担任领导，但是，由于德国无时无刻不在壮大，这种情况是可能发生的。
    因此，当然，英国也许会决定拒绝所有这些可能性而“单干”——不承认说它的力量和地位已有所改变。但是，在苏伊士所发生的一切以后，这样的道路将会是最冒险的了！
