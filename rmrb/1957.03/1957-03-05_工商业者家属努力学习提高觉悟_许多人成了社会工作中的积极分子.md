Industrialist and Businessmen's Families Diligently Study to Raise Awareness; Many Become Active Participants in Social Work

(Report from our newspaper) Over the past year, industrialist and businessman's families across the country have launched a wave of studying and actively participating in work, and many have become active participants in social work.

According to statistics from eight cities including Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Jinan, 35,674 people have been organized to participate in local industrial and commercial political schools, current affairs lectures, family study classes, etc., for systematic study. In many areas, new phenomena such as couples studying together, mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law in the same class, helping and encouraging each other, and seeking progress together have emerged. For example, among the 209 family members studying in the first phase of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Political School, there were 44 couples studying together.

Through study, many industrialist and businessman's families have become active participants in social work. According to statistics from five cities including Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, and Bengbu, 3,836 people have become activists. Some of them are engaged in family literacy work, while others are engaged in street and neighborhood work. Among the 15,700 female literacy teachers in Shanghai, 1,100 are from industrialist and businessman's families. Among them, 123 were named literacy activists and outstanding teachers. They overcame various difficulties, used their living rooms as classrooms, and helped working women learn to read. In Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, 84 nurseries (institutions) were opened with money and effort from industrialist and businessman's families, solving the difficulties faced by some female employees burdened by children.

In addition, industrialist and businessman's families have also played a certain role in encouraging their relatives to accept socialist transformation, improve production and operation, educate their children well, and manage household affairs. For example, industrialist and businessman's families account for 23.3% of the 1,204 "Five-Good" households in Qingdao.

    工商业者家属努力学习提高觉悟
    许多人成了社会工作中的积极分子
    本报讯  过去一年来，全国各地工商业者家属掀起了学习热潮，并积极参加工作，已有不少人成为社会工作中的积极分子。
    据上海、北京、天津、重庆、杭州、广州、武汉、济南等八个市的统计，就有三万五千六百七十四人组织起来参加了当地的工商界政治学校、时事讲座、家属学习班等，进行系统的学习。在不少地区还出现了夫妻同学、婆媳同班、互助互勉、共求进步的新气象。如在上海市工商界政治学校第一期学习的二百零九个家属学员中，就有四十四对夫妻同学。
    通过学习，不少工商业者家属成了社会工作中的积极分子。根据上海、北京、天津、济南、蚌埠五个市的统计，就有三千八百三十六人当了积极分子。她们有的是担任家属扫盲工作，有的担任街道里弄工作。上海市一万五千七百个扫盲女教师中，工商业者家属就有一千一百人。其中有一百二十三人被评为扫盲积极分子和优秀教师。她们克服种种困难，用客厅当教室，帮助劳动妇女学习文化。在北京、上海、天津三个市，由工商业者家属出钱出力开办的托儿站（所）就有八十四处，解决了一部分女职工受孩子牵累的困难。
    此外，工商业者家属在鼓励亲人接受社会主义改造、搞好生产经营、教育好子女和搞好家务方面也起到了一定的作用。如青岛市的一千二百零四户“五好”户中，工商业者家属就占23.3％。
