Xinhua News Agency, Rome, March 26th: The two treaties on establishing a "Common Market" for six European countries and the "European Atomic Energy Community" were signed in Rome on the afternoon of March 25th.

The treaties were signed by: Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, West German Chancellor Adenauer, French Foreign Minister Pineau, Italian Foreign Minister Martino, Luxembourg Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bech, and Dutch Foreign Minister Luns.

After these two treaties are signed, they will have to be submitted to the parliaments of the six countries for final approval. According to spokesmen for the six countries after the signing of the treaties, the parliamentary approval procedures will drag on until the end of this year, so the formal establishment of these two organizations will not take place until the beginning of next year.

The two treaties stipulate that tariffs and import quotas should be gradually abolished between the six signatory countries, and a common tariff rate should be established for countries outside the six countries. The resources of the six countries will be pooled to jointly develop the atomic energy industry. Some people in France and other Western European countries have constantly linked the plan to establish a European "Common Market" and "Atomic Energy Community" with the idea of ​​building Western Europe into a "third force" in their statements.

According to an Associated Press report, experts on European issues believe that it only takes a few minutes to sign the treaty, but it will take twelve to seventeen years to adjust the economies of various countries to implement these two treaties. And even then, it is difficult to say whether it can be achieved.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 26th: Officials from the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Finance stated today that they are worried that the establishment of the West European six-nation "Common Market" will gradually reduce the amount of textiles, canned fish, and toys and other commodities exported by Japan to the region (which in the past accounted for about 10% of Japan's total exports); Japan's prospects for selling machinery, chemicals, and high-tech products to Southeast Asia, south-central America, Africa, and the Near and Middle East will also be severely and adversely affected.

These officials said that in order to eliminate the adverse effects of the European "Common Market" on Japan, Japan is prepared to request countries joining the European "Common Market" to relax the exclusive arrangements of the customs union at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade conference to be held this spring. These officials also revealed that the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Finance have jointly agreed to establish a "European Economic Integration Research Association" to study countermeasures; at the same time, Japan is also planning to initiate the establishment of an "Asian Economic Group."

　　西欧“共同市场”和“原子能联营”条约签字
　　日本政府表示忧虑　准备采取对抗办法
    据新华社26日讯　罗马消息：关于建立欧洲六国“共同市场”和“欧洲原子能联营组织”的两项条约已经在3月25日下午在罗马签字。
    在条约上签字的是：比利时外交大臣斯巴克、西德总理阿登纳、法国外交部长比诺、意大利外交部长马蒂诺、卢森堡首相兼外交大臣伯克和荷兰外交大臣伦斯。
    这两个条约签定以后，还要提交六国议会最后批准。据六国发言人在条约签字后表示，议会的批准手续将拖到今年年底，因此这两个组织的正式成立要到明年年初。
    这两项条约规定在缔约的六国之间逐步取消关税和进口限额并且对六国以外的国家建立共同的关税率，集合六国的资源共同发展原子能工业。法国和西欧其他国家的一些人士曾经在他们的言论中不断地把成立欧洲“共同市场”和“原子能联营组织”的计划同把西欧建成
  “第三种力量”的主张联系起来。
    据美联社消息，欧洲问题的专家们认为，在条约上签字只需要几分钟，但是调整各国经济以便使这两个条约付诸实现则需要十二年到十七年的时间。而且到了那时，能否实现也很难说。
    据新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本通商产业省和大藏省的官员们今天表示担心，西欧六国“共同市场”的建立将使日本向这个地区输出的纺织品、鱼类罐头和玩具等商品的数量（过去占日本出口总额的10％左右）逐渐减少；日本向东南亚、中美南部、非洲和中近东销售机器、化学品和高度技术产品的前景也将受到严重的不利影响。
    这些官员们说，为了消除欧洲“共同市场”对日本的不利影响，日本准备在将于今年春天召开的关税及贸易总协定大会上，要求加入欧洲“共同市场”的国家放宽关税同盟的排他性的安排。这些官员还透露，日本通商产业省和大藏省已经共同商定要设立一个“欧洲经济联合研究会”，来研究对策；同时，日本还在计划发起成立一个“亚洲经济集团”。
