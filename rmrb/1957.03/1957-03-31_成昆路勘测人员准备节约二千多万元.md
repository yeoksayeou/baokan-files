　　Chengdu-Kunming Railway Surveyors Prepare to Save Over 20 Million Yuan
    (Our report) According to the Yunnan Daily news: The Third Survey Brigade of the Second Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways, stationed in Kunming and responsible for surveying the Chengdu-Kunming railway line, plans to save the country over 26 million yuan this year. This amount of money could build a railway from Kunming to Kunyang. After the various detachments and offices of the brigade actively engaged in the production increase and economy campaign, they tried every means to find tricks, tap potential, thoroughly assess their resources, and seize both large and small opportunities, formulating well-founded production increase and economy plans and measures. The line group, adhering to the principle of "more investigation, more research, more comparison," lowered the technical standards that could be lowered, tried to shorten the line as much as possible, and reduced dividing points; the large structure group adopted measures such as compressing bridge openings, improving the line, moving bridge positions, and changing bridge types according to the water flow to reduce investment in large structures; the geology and roadbed group tried to use natural observation points to replace drilling holes, reduce drilling failures, save operating costs and fuel consumption, and tried to use natural materials and change roadbed types to reduce project costs and save survey costs by using local materials.

　　成昆路勘测人员准备节约二千多万元
    本报讯  据云南日报消息：驻在昆明的勘测成昆铁路线路的铁道部第二设计院第三勘测总队，今年要为国家节约两千六百多万元。这笔资金可以修一条从昆明到昆阳的铁路。总队所属各分队、各室积极投入增产节约运动后，就千方百计地找窍门、挖潜力，详细摸家底，抓住大的也不放过小的，制订了有充分根据的增产节约计划和措施。线路组本着“多调查、多研究、多比较”的方针，降低了可以降低的技术标准，尽量缩短线路，减少分界点；大型组根据水的流量，采取压缩桥孔，改善线路，移挪桥位，改变桥式等措施减少大型建筑物的投资；地质路基组则尽量用天然观测点来代替钻挖孔，减少钻探故障，节省运营费及油料消耗，尽量利用天然材料、改变路基类型，做到就地取材以降低工程造价和节省勘测费用。
