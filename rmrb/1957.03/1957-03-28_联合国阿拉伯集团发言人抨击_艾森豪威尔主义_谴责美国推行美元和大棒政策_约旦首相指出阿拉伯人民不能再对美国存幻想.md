Xinhua News Agency, March 27th, New York Dispatch: The acting chairman of the United Nations Arab Group, Fa'ez Sayegh, criticized the "Eisenhower Doctrine" on March 25th, saying that this "doctrine" involves "open acts of aggression by communist countries, while there is no actual danger of such aggression in the Middle East, but it does not involve similar actions by other countries."

Speaking at the fifth annual meeting of the American Friends of the Middle East Society, Sayegh said that the US Middle East plan does not provide safeguards against the most serious threats in the minds of the Arabs, namely "colonial aggression or Zionist expansion."

Sayegh also said that there are reports that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" may be used for dollar diplomacy and power politics to force Arab countries to follow US policies; such news has made the Arab world uneasy in the past few weeks.

He said: "There have been reports of attempts to buy off an Arab president."

Xinhua News Agency, March 27th, Amman Dispatch: Jordanian Prime Minister Nabulsi said at a press conference on March 26th that the United States' participation in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee has revealed its mask. This dispels any illusions the Arab people may have about US policy. He pointed out that this action exposed the United States' intention to interfere in the affairs of the region. He said: "The Arabs will not agree to this."

Nabulsi said a day earlier at the Palestinian Arab refugee camp in Jericho: "We oppose replacing one imperialism with another imperialism, and we demand to live freely in our homeland that is not ruled by foreigners." These remarks were considered to be directed at the US "Eisenhower Doctrine." Nabulsi also said that establishing a federation with liberated Arab countries is the main goal of his government.

Jordanian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Rimawi pointed out that the purpose of the United States' participation in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee is to undermine the unity of the Arab liberation movement. He said that the communique of the US-British Bermuda talks completely exposed the true face of American policy.

According to a broadcast by Cairo Radio, Jordan, after consultation with free Arab countries, has agreed to US President's special envoy Richards visiting Jordan. The radio quoted Nabulsi's remarks to a Middle East News Agency reporter as saying: "Once our policies and views are understood, we do not object to listening to the opinions of those who want to lecture us." Nabulsi said: "We have repeatedly condemned the theory of a Middle East vacuum and reject any country's right to assume the role of protector of other countries. The only thing that guides our country in establishing relations with other countries in accordance with the policy of active neutrality is our own interests. It is on this basis that we will receive President Eisenhower's special envoy."

Xinhua News Agency, March 27th, TASS Damascus, March 26th: Jabri, chairman of the Syrian Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, told reporters when commenting on the results of the US-British Bermuda talks that the joint communique of Eisenhower and Macmillan had shattered all hopes that some optimists had for the fairness of US policy.

Jabri emphasized that the current task of the Arabs is to strengthen their own unity.

Xinhua News Agency, March 27th, TASS Damascus, March 26th: Syrian public opinion and officials are angered by the US decision to participate in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee.

"Al-Raya" pointed out: "The United States' decision to implement a policy of strengthening the Baghdad Pact comes after the pact has suffered no small defeat." It emphasized: "One of the purposes of the Eisenhower Doctrine is to revive the pact under the protection of the United States."

"Al-Raya" said: "The United States' participation in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee confirms the United States' aggressive intentions towards the liberated Arab countries. Syria and its Arab brothers will not give up the struggle against the Baghdad Pact, believing that this treaty is an imperialist tool used to achieve Western selfish goals in the region."

Syrian political figures fiercely criticized the US decision to participate in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee. They said that the United States wants to use this action to "force others to accept a certain policy, which the countries in this region should accept unconditionally, regardless of whether it is in their own interests." Political figures said: "The United States has thus demonstrated the true essence of its foreign policy and its consistency with the imperialist conspiracy against which the liberated people are waging an irreconcilable struggle."

    联合国阿拉伯集团发言人抨击“艾森豪威尔主义”
　　谴责美国推行美元和大棒政策
　　约旦首相指出阿拉伯人民不能再对美国存幻想
    新华社27日讯　纽约消息：联合国阿拉伯国家集团代理主席法阿兹·萨耶格3月25日批评“艾森豪威尔主义”说：这个“主义”涉及到“共产主义国家的公开侵略行动，而在中东并没有发生这种侵略的实际危险，但是它并不涉及其他国家进行的类似行动。”
    萨耶格在对美国中东之友社第五届年会发表演说的时候说，美国的这个中东计划没有提供防止阿拉伯人心目中最严重的威胁的保障，那就是“殖民主义侵略或者犹太复国主义扩张”。
    萨耶格还说，有消息说，“艾森豪威尔主义”可能用来从事美元外交和强权政治，以迫使阿拉伯国家追随美国的政策；这种消息使阿拉伯世界在过去几周中感到不安。
    他说：“已经有企图收买一位阿拉伯总统的消息。”
    新华社27日讯　安曼消息：约旦首相纳布西3月26日在记者招待会上说，美国参加巴格达条约军事委员会，从而揭开了它的假面具。这就解除了阿拉伯人民对于美国政策的任何幻想。他指出，这一行动暴露了美国干涉这个地区事务的意图。他说：“阿拉伯人是不会同意这样做的。”
    纳布西早一天在杰里科的巴勒斯坦阿拉伯难民营中说：“我们反对用另外一个帝国主义来代替一个帝国主义的做法，我们要求自由地生活在不是由外国人统治的我们的祖国土地上。”这些话被认为是针对美国的“艾森豪威尔主义”而说的。纳布西还说，同解放了的阿拉伯国家成立联邦是他的政府的主要目标。
    约旦外交国务大臣里马维指出，美国参加巴格达条约军事委员会的目的是破坏阿拉伯解放运动的团结。他说，美英百慕大会谈公报完全暴露了美国政策的真面目。
    据开罗电台广播，约旦在同自由阿拉伯国家磋商后已经同意美国总统的特使理查兹去约旦访问。电台援引纳布西对中东通讯社记者的谈话说：“一旦我们的政策和观点被人们了解以后，我们并不反对倾听那些想要教训我们的人们的意见”。纳布西说：“我们几次指责中东真空的理论，并且拒绝任何国家有担当其他国家保护者角色的权利。指导我国按照积极中立政策同其他国家建立关系的唯一东西就是我国的利益。我们就是在这个基础上来接待艾森豪威尔总统的特使。”
    新华社27日讯　塔斯社大马士革26日讯：叙利亚议会外交委员会主席贾布里在评论美英百慕大会谈结果时对新闻记者说，艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦的联合公报使某些乐观主义者对美国政策的公正性所怀抱的一切希望都破灭了。
    贾布里强调指出，阿拉伯人目前的任务就是加强自己的团结。
    据新华社27日讯　塔斯社大马士革26日讯：叙利亚舆论和官方人士对于美国决定参加巴格达条约军事委员会一事感到愤怒。
      “旗帜报”指出：“美国决定执行加强巴格达条约的政策是在这个条约遭到不小的失败以后。”它强调指出：“艾森豪威尔主义的目的之一是在美国的庇护下复活这个条约。”
      “旗帜报”说：“美国参加巴格达条约军事委员会一事证实了美国对获得了解放的阿拉伯国家的侵略意图。叙利亚和阿拉伯兄弟国家不会放弃同巴格达条约的斗争，认为这个条约是用来实现西方在这一地区的自私目的的帝国主义工具。”
    叙利亚政界人士激烈抨击美国参加巴格达条约军事委员会的决定。他们说，美国想以这种行动来“强迫他人接受某种政策，而这一地区的国家应当无条件地接受它，不问它是否符合自己的利益”。政界人士说：“美国就这样表明了自己的对外政策的真正实质和它同获得了解放的人民正与之进行不可调和斗争的帝国主义阴谋的一致。”
