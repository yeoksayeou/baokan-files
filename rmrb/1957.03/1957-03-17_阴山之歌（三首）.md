	Songs of Yinshan (Three Songs)
	Han Yanru
	Singing Mountain Songs
	There are many cattle and sheep on Daqing Mountain,
	Singing mountain songs for generations;
	Singing isn't hard,
	Three sings, two sings, a basketful.
	A Cloud
	A cloud in the clear blue sky,
	Brother wants to go up the mountain, sister wants to follow;
	Picking a mountain lily,
	Take a break from mowing grass and give it to brother.
	A Head Full of Red
	Pearls and agate, a head full of red,
	Han people love the Mongolian people;
	Mongolian people, Han people, two ethnic groups,
	Two strands twisted into one rope.
	July 1956 in Wuchuan

    阴山之歌（三首）
    韩燕如
    唱山歌
    大青山上牛羊多，
    祖祖辈辈唱山歌；
    要说唱歌也不难，
    三唱两唱一筐篮。
    一朵云
    湛蓝蓝天一朵云，
    哥要上山妹要跟；
    摘得山丹花一朵，
    打草歇下送哥哥。
    满头红
    珍珠玛瑙满头红，
    汉人爱的蒙古人；
    蒙人汉人两族人，
    两股拧成一股绳。
    1956年7月于武川
