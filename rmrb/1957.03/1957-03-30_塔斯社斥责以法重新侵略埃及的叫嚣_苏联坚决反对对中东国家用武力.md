Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 29th: TASS issued a statement on March 28th stating that the Soviet government firmly opposes the use of force against Middle Eastern countries.

TASS said that the recent statements made by certain Israeli politicians and the recent news published in French newspapers have more frequently talked about Israel's preparation to launch a new aggression against Egypt. Israeli politicians have expressed open threats to Egypt, insisting that Israel wants navigation through the Gulf of Aqaba and opposes restoring the Gaza Strip to its original state four months ago. Official representatives of the French government have also assured Israel that France will fulfill its promise to support Israel once Israel launches a new aggression against Egypt.

TASS said that the provocative remarks made by Israeli politicians are an open disregard for the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly. At the same time, these remarks unambiguously indicate that the United States has made some kind of guarantee to support Israel against Arab countries. It is said that this guarantee was made in a gentleman's agreement between the US Secretary of State and the Israeli Foreign Minister, and this guarantee was also notified to the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.

TASS pointed out that it is worth noting that the French government has not denied the recent news published in newspapers regarding France's preparations for launching a new aggression against Egypt.

This situation cannot but attract the attention of world public opinion.

TASS continued by saying that Soviet leaders have stated that the Soviet government firmly opposed in the past, and still firmly opposes now, the use of force against Middle Eastern countries. A new aggression against Egypt would cause a dangerous situation and would directly cause the danger of a large-scale military conflict that would have terrible consequences for the cause of peace. It is for this reason that these people firmly condemn the attitude taken by the extremists in Israel and France.

    塔斯社斥责以法重新侵略埃及的叫嚣
　　苏联坚决反对对中东国家用武力
    新华社莫斯科29日电  塔斯社3月28日发表声明说，苏联政府坚决反对对中东国家使用武力。
    塔斯社说，某些以色列政治家最近发表的言论以及法国报纸最近刊载的消息，都更加经常地谈到以色列准备对埃及重新发动侵略。以色列政治家对埃及表示了公开的威胁，坚持以色列要在亚喀巴湾通航，反对恢复四个月前加沙地带的原来状态。而法国政府的官方代表也向以色列保证，一旦以色列重新向埃及发动侵略，法国将履行它支持以色列的诺言。
    塔斯社说，以色列政治家发表挑衅性的言论是公开地漠视联合国大会的决议。同时，这些言论毫不含糊地表明，美国已经作出了某种支持以色列反对阿拉伯国家的保证。据说，这种保证是在美国国务卿和以色列外交部长之间的一项君子协定中作出的，这种保证也通知了法国总理和外交部长。
    塔斯社指出，值得注意的是，法国政府并没有否认报纸最近发表的有关法国为了对埃及发动新侵略而进行准备工作的消息。
    这种情况不能不引起世界舆论的注意。
    塔斯社接着说，苏联领导人士表明，苏联政府过去坚决反对、现在仍旧坚决反对对中东国家使用武力。对埃及发动新的侵略会引起危险的局势，并且会直接引起对和平事业造成可怕后果的大规模军事冲突的危险。正是这个原因，这些人士坚决谴责以色列和法国的极端分子所采取的态度。
