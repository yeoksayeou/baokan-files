I fully endorse Chairman Mao's instructions at the Supreme State Conference and the reports made by Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. Today, I would like to talk about my personal understanding and opinions on the agricultural production increase, the increase in farmers' income, and the improvement of living standards in Hubei Province last year.

Hubei Province achieved agricultural cooperativization last year. After the farmers were organized, they actively worked hard and struggled diligently under the leadership of the Party and the government, and achieved great success on the agricultural production front. Not only did they complete the 1956 production plan, but they also exceeded the targets required by the 1957 national plan. The increase in the yields of several major crops are as follows: Total grain output reached 21 billion jin, an increase of 2.2 billion jin compared to 1955, exceeding the 1957 national plan target by 15.9%. Cotton output was 4 million dan, an increase of 1.08 million dan compared to 1955, exceeding the 1957 national plan target by 30.7%. Soybean output was 661 million jin, an increase of 58% compared to 1955, exceeding the 1957 national plan target by 24.3%. Other crops such as ramie and jute also exceeded the 1957 national plan targets. In the past, some people in Hubei Province heard that the yield per mu was 1,000 jin of grain and 100 jin of ginned cotton, and they thought it was impossible. However, last year, many units with high yields appeared, and the yield per unit area in some areas even broke historical records. According to statistics from the four special districts of Huanggang, Xiaogan, Jingzhou, and Yichang: there were six districts with an average grain yield of 1,000 jin per mu, 214 townships with 1,000 jin per mu, and 1,187 agricultural cooperatives with 1,000 jin per mu. There were eleven townships with an average yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and 506 agricultural cooperatives with 100 jin per mu. The Shuangtai Agricultural Cooperative in Wolong Township, Xiaogan County, with 63.3 mu of double-cropping rice, had an average yield of 1,164 jin per mu, of which 6.65 mu had an average yield of up to 2,023 jin. The Qunli Cooperative in Lanxi Township, Xishui County, with 46 mu of medium-season japonica rice, had an average yield of 1,400 jin per mu, of which 2.18 mu had an average yield of up to 1,720 jin. The Minle Cooperative in Shenwan Township, Gucheng County, with 430 mu of wheat, had an average yield of 500 jin per mu, of which 7.4 mu had an average yield of up to 1,052 jin. The Shiban Cooperative in Hezuo Township, Jingshan County, with 37 mu of cotton, had an average yield of 109 jin of ginned cotton per mu, of which 1.07 mu had an average yield of 407 jin. The Jianli Cooperative in Shuanghe Township, Xinzhou County, with 1,085 mu of rapeseed, had an average yield of 441 jin per mu.

The superiority of agricultural cooperativization is also reflected in the implementation of agricultural technology reform, the promotion of advanced production experience, and the use of collective strength to improve labor productivity. In particular, technological reform plays an important role in increasing agricultural production. Last year, Hubei Province implemented the "Five Reforms": about 1.75 million mu were converted from one crop to two crops or from two crops to three crops, increasing grain production by 300 million jin; about 500,000 mu of dry land were converted to paddy fields, increasing grain production by 100 million jin; about 1 million mu of low-yield crops were converted to high-yield crops, increasing grain production by 100 million jin; about 220,000 mu of sloping land were converted to terraced fields, increasing grain production by 22.2 million jin. Together with the promotion of improved varieties, which increased the average yield by 10% to 20%, the total increase was about 800 million jin of grain. Many things that were idealistic in the past became reality after the realization of cooperativization. For example, the Yuhong Agricultural Cooperative in Shiqiaopu Township, Luotian County, whose members had suffered from floods, waterlogging, and drought for years, which they were unable to control. Last year, after the cooperative was organized, it focused on this specific situation and organized members to concentrate their efforts and fight against natural disasters. They modified channels, drainage ditches, river courses, and dikes, which basically eliminated the threat of disasters for 30 years. Grain production alone increased by 177,000 jin. The members said happily, "Dry ponds have become water ponds, and sandy fields have become rice fields." The Tuanjie Cooperative in Xuhuang Township, Tianmen County, faced difficulties such as having many fields, fields being far away, and a lack of labor after its establishment. Thanks to the collective wisdom of the members, they modified three rounds of ox carts and created eight new types of agricultural tools such as cotton strip seeders and cotton double-tooth row markers, saving more than 17,000 labor days, overcoming the shortage of labor, and ensuring high yields for the entire cooperative. The practice of agricultural production last year proved that the "Eighth National Congress" resolution on the political report pointed out that "in the near future, our country will not be able to have a large agricultural machinery industry and chemical fertilizer industry, nor can we carry out large-scale reclamation, and water and drought disasters cannot be quickly eradicated" in the situation, "fully exploit the superior conditions of agricultural cooperativization, relying on the collective strength of cooperatives and government support, and take measures such as building water conservancy projects...improving varieties, promoting new agricultural tools...to increase yield per unit area" is completely correct.

With the bumper harvest in agricultural production, agricultural cooperatives have been further consolidated. Farmers' incomes have increased, and their lives have been further improved and enhanced. According to statistics from 54,144 cooperatives in the five special districts of Huanggang, Xiaogan, Jingzhou, Yichang, and Enshi: cooperatives with increased production accounted for 86.4%, cooperatives with maintained production accounted for 6.98%, and cooperatives with decreased production accounted for 6.53%. From the perspective of the increase in production of advanced cooperatives, it is more significant than that of elementary cooperatives. According to statistics from 10,934 cooperatives: cooperatives with increased production accounted for 92.56%, cooperatives with maintained production accounted for 4.36%, and cooperatives with decreased production accounted for only 3.07%. In addition, according to statistics from 1,777,376 households in 20,198 cooperatives in the above-mentioned five special districts: 84.22% of households increased their income, 7.86% of households did not increase or decrease, and 7.92% of households decreased their income. Since last winter, various measures have been taken for cooperatives (households) with reduced production, such as striving to develop sideline production. As a result, 30% of the cooperatives with reduced production have been transformed into cooperatives with increased production, and 40% of the cooperatives with reduced production have been transformed into cooperatives with maintained production. It has been fully realized that 95% of agricultural cooperatives in the province have increased production and about 90% of cooperative members have increased their income.

Although agricultural cooperativization has only been implemented for a year, many facts have told us that the road taken by our country's farmers is completely correct and beyond doubt. As for some people who still doubt the superiority of agricultural cooperativization or the extent of its superiority, this is mainly because they do not have enough understanding of the comprehensive and true situation of agricultural production and farmers' lives. What they hear is one-sided reflections of certain shortcomings or errors, so it is difficult for them to come to correct understandings and opinions. For example, some people reflect that "farmers' lives are extremely hard," and so on. Here is a brief introduction to the situation in Liming Township in Daye County and Xinjiang Township in Echeng County, which I personally investigated. Both townships are located in hilly areas and can represent the general situation in Hubei Province. Last year, the natural conditions in the two townships were worse than in 1955, mainly due to the autumn drought that lasted for five months. However, thanks to the great strength of the organized farmers, they overcame the drought, thus ensuring the realization of the production plan. The grain output of Liming Township was 5,530,000 jin, which was 1,200,000 jin more than the output set in 1955. Xinjiang Township mainly produces cotton and secondly grain. The grain output was 3,160,000 jin, which was also a 9% increase compared to 1955. They all paid attention to sideline production. The income of Liming Township was 110,000 yuan, and the income of Xinjiang Township was 48,000 yuan. In both townships, with the growth of production, farmers' lives have been greatly improved. First of all, the amount of grain retained for personal use has increased compared to previous years. In Liming Township, in addition to paying agricultural taxes and selling surplus grain to the state totaling 1,480,000 jin, the average amount of grain retained by farmers for their own use was 530 jin per person per year, which was 50 jin higher than in 1955. In the past, about 115 households needed relief, and about 200 households needed grain from the government. These situations no longer exist this year. Some even had surplus grain to sell to the state. A member named Xu Taizhang was still a relief recipient in 1955. After joining the advanced agricultural cooperative last year, his family's labor income for the whole year was as high as 500 yuan. In addition to replacing old clothes with new clothes for adults and children, he also prepared to build a house. In Xinjiang Township, in addition to retaining all the grain produced by themselves, the government plans to allocate 730,000 jin to supply households in need of grain. Together with the grain produced by themselves, the average grain per person per year is 550 jin, which is also 10 jin higher than in 1955. The farmers' edible oil in the two townships has also increased from 4 liang per person per month to half a jin. Farmers are satisfied with the benefits of agricultural cooperativization, the bumper harvest in agricultural production, and the improvement of their lives. For example, a song popular among farmers in Xundian Township, Anlu County, goes: "The Communist Party has good ideas, the cooperative has strong production, the granary is full of grain and the pond is full of fish, the pens are full of fat pigs and goats are all over the mountains, and life is getting better year by year." Of course, with the increase in income, farmers are constantly making new demands in terms of production and life. We believe that with the development of the country's socialist construction and the continuous growth of production, they will gradually get satisfactory solutions.

In short, the great revolution of implementing agricultural cooperativization and transforming the small-scale peasant private ownership system into collective ownership in our country has taken root in the vast countryside, and has blossomed and borne fruit. Of course, last year, in leading cooperatives and organizing collective production by farmers, we also encountered many new problems. At the same time, in dealing with and solving problems, on the one hand, we explored many valuable experiences, but on the other hand, we also had some shortcomings and errors and lessons of failure. Regarding the shortcomings that have arisen, the main reason is that we did not fully implement the central government's policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical." After criticizing right-leaning conservatism, while achieving great results, we did not have enough foresight for some of the possible hasty emotions. For example, the promotion of high-quality japonica rice varieties involved planting on a larger area without leadership or mass experience, ignoring local conditions, and not adhering to the principles of gradual development from points to areas and voluntary participation by the masses, which caused dissatisfaction among some farmers. Although the total average yield of early, middle, and late japonica rice in the province last year was still slightly higher than that of indica rice, it was still wrong from the perspective of our working methods. Furthermore, in terms of business management within cooperatives, many township and cooperative cadres did not have a democratic enough style, some cadres were not fair enough in handling affairs, and a few cadres had phenomena of corruption and violation of laws and regulations. It also reflects that we have not fully implemented the policy of "running cooperatives diligently and thriftily and democratically" in our work. For these shortcomings and errors, most of them were corrected or dealt with in a timely manner after they were discovered. In November last year, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions, requiring all localities to conduct a deeper and more systematic review and criticism of the shortcomings and errors that had occurred, through a comparison of good and bad typical examples, while affirming the achievements of the work, when deeply studying the "Eighth National Congress" documents, combined with summarizing work and rectifying work styles, drawing lessons, and improving work, armed the thinking of cadres. All these efforts have laid a good foundation for further consolidating agricultural cooperatives and striving for greater bumper harvests in agricultural production this year.

    王海山谈湖北省实现农业合作化获得大增产的一年
    我完全拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上的指示和周总理、李富春副总理、陈叔通副主席所作的报告。今天我想就湖北省去年农业增产、农民收入增加和生活改善的情况，谈谈个人的认识和意见。
    湖北省去年实现农业合作化，农民组织起来后，他们在党和政府领导下，积极努力、艰苦奋斗，在农业生产战线上取得了巨大的成绩。不仅完成了1956年的生产计划任务，还超过了1957年国家计划要求的指标。几项主要农作物的增产情况是：粮食总产量达到二百一十亿斤，比1955年增产二十二亿斤，超过1957年国家计划指标的15.9％。棉花产量四百万担，比1955年增产一百零八万担，超过1957年国家计划指标的30.7％。大豆产量六点六一亿斤，比1955年增产58％，超过1957年国家计划指标的24.3％。其它如苎麻、黄麻等作物也都超过1957年国家计划指标。过去湖北地区有人听说亩产千斤粮和亩产百斤皮棉，都认为是不可能的事。但去年已经出现了许多高额丰产的单位，有的地区的单位面积产量还打破了历史纪录。根据黄冈，孝感、荆州、宜昌四个专区的统计：粮食平均亩产千斤的区有六个，千斤的乡有二百一十四个，千斤的社有一千一百八十七个。平均亩产皮棉百斤的乡有十一个，百斤社有五百零六个。孝感县卧龙乡双台农业社双季稻六十三点三亩，平均亩产一千一百六十四斤，其中六点六五亩，平均亩产高达二千零二十三斤；浠水县兰溪乡群利社四十六亩中粳稻，平均亩产一千四百斤，其中二点一八亩，平均亩产高达一千七百二十斤。谷城县沈湾乡民乐社小麦四百三十亩，平均亩产五百斤，其中七点四亩，平均亩产高达一千零五十二斤。京山县合作乡石板社棉花三十七亩，平均亩产皮棉一百零九斤，其中一点零七亩，平均亩产四百零七斤。新洲县双河乡建利社的油菜一千零八十五亩，平均亩产四百四十一斤。
    农业合作化的优越性，还表现在实行农业技术改革，推广先进生产经验和发挥集体力量提高劳动生产率方面。特别是技术改革对农业增产起着重要的作用。去年湖北省实行了“五改”，一季改两季或两季改三季的约有一百七十五万亩，增产粮食三亿斤；旱地改水田的约有五十万亩，增产粮食一亿斤；低产作物改高产作物的约有一百万亩，增产粮食一亿斤；坡地改梯田的约有二十二万亩，增产粮食二千二百万斤。连同推广优良品种平均增产一成到两成，总共增加八亿斤左右的粮食。农民在过去不少是理想的事情，在合作化实现后变为了现实。如罗田县石桥铺乡玉虹农业社，该社社员过去历年来经常遭受洪灾、涝灾、旱灾的危害，无法治理。去年组织了合作社，即针对这个具体情况，组织社员集中力量，展开了同自然灾害作斗争，他们修改渠道、排水沟，修改河道和堤防等工作，基本上消灭了三十年来灾害的威胁，仅就粮食一项，增产了十七万七千斤。社员们欢天喜地的说：“干塘变成了水塘，沙畈变成了米畈”。天门县徐黄乡团结社，他们在建社后存在着田多、田远和劳动力缺乏等困难。由于发挥了社员的集体智慧，去年一年中改制了三轮牛车，创造了棉花条播机、棉花双齿划行器等八种新式农具，节省劳动力达一万七千多个，克服了劳动力不足的困难，保证全社获得高额丰产。去年农业生产的实践证明了“八大”关于政治报告决议中指出的“在最近的将来我国还不能有很大的农业机械工业和化学肥料工业，还不能进行很大规模的垦荒，水旱灾害也还不能迅速根治”的情况下， “充分发挥农业已经基本上实现合作化这个优越条件，依靠合作社的集体力量和政府的支援，采取兴修水利……改良品种、推广新式农具……等项措施，来增加单位面积产量”是完全正确的。
    农业生产丰收，农业合作社进一步获得了巩固。农民收入增加，生活有了进一步的改善和提高。根据黄冈、孝感、荆州、宜昌、恩施五个专区五万四千一百四十四个社的统计：增产社占86.4％，保产社占6.98％，减产社占6.53％。从高级社的增产情况看，比初级社更加显著。据一万零九百三十四个社的统计：增产社占92.56％，保产社占4.36％，减产社仅占3.07％。另据上述五个专区二万零一百九十八个社的一百七十七万七千三百七十六户社员中的统计：有84.22％的户增加了收入，有7.86％的户不增不减，有7.92％的户减少了收入。自去冬以来，对于减产的社（户），也采取各项措施，努力发展副业生产等之后，已有30％的减产社转为增产社，40％的减产社转为了保产社。全省95％的农业社增产和90％左右的社员增加收入完全实现了。
    农业合作化虽仅有一年的时间，但已经有许许多多的事实告诉了我们，我国农民所走的这条道路是完全正确而勿容怀疑的。至于还有一部分人迄今对农业合作化有无优越性？或优越性大小？持有怀疑的态度，这主要的是他们对农业生产和农民生活的全面真实的情况了解的还不多，所听到的是某些缺点或错误的片面反映，因而也就很难得出正确的认识和意见来。例如有人反映说：“农民生活苦极了”等等。这里简要地介绍一下，我亲自考察大冶县的黎明乡和鄂城县新界乡的情况。这两个乡均为丘陵地区，可代表湖北地区一般性的情况。去年两个乡自然条件比55年要差，主要是秋旱长达五个月。但由于农民组织起来的巨大力量，战胜了旱灾，从而保证了生产计划的实现。黎明乡粮食产量五百五十三万斤，比1955年三定产量多一百二十万斤。新界乡以产棉为主，粮食次之，粮食产量为三百一十六万斤，也较1955年增加9％。他们都注意了副业生产，黎明乡收入十一万元，新界乡收入四万八千元。这两个乡同样随着生产的增长，农民生活都得到很大的改善，首先四留粮较往年提高了。黎明乡除交纳农业税和出售给国家的余粮合计为一百四十八万斤外，农民自留粮每人每年平均五百三十斤，比1955年提高了五十斤。该乡历年来都有一百一十五户左右需要救济，二百户左右缺粮的需政府供应，这些情况去年都没有了。有的还有余粮卖给国家。一个社员叫徐太章，在1955年还是救济户，去年参加高级农业合作社后，全家一年劳动收入高达五百元，除大人小孩换上新衣服外，还准备修建房屋。新界乡除自产的粮食全部留用外，政府拟调拨七十三万斤供应缺粮户，连同自产粮食合计，每人每年平均粮食五百五十斤，也较1955年提高了十斤。两个乡农民的食油也由每人每月四两提高到半斤。农民对农业合作化的好处，农业生产又获得丰收以及生活的改善是满意的。如安陆县巡店乡农民中流行的一首歌“共产党、好主张，合作社、生产强，谷满仓来鱼满塘，满圈肥猪遍山羊，日子一年比一年强”。当然，随着收入的增加，农民在生产和生活方面也不断提出新的要求，我们相信随着国家社会主义建设事业的发展和生产不断的增长，逐步会获得满意的解决。
    总之，我国实行农业合作化，改造小农个体私有制为集体所有制，这个伟大的革命，已在广大农村中生了根，而且开花结了果。当然我们去年领导合作社和组织农民集体生产，也碰到过许多新的问题，同时在处理和解决问题中，一方面摸索了很多宝贵的经验，但另一方面也发生过某些缺点错误且招致过失败的教训。对产生的缺点，主要是我们对中央指示的“又多、又快、又好、又省”的方针贯彻执行的不够全面。在批判右倾保守之后，与获得巨大成绩的同时，对于可能发生的某些急躁情绪预见不够。例如推广粳稻良种，在领导和群众没有经验的情况下较大面积播种，忽视了因地制宜，没有坚持由点到面和群众自愿的原则，曾引起部分农民的不满。尽管去年全省早、中、晚粳总平均还较籼稻略有增加，但从我们工作方法上检查仍是错误的。再如合作社内经营管理方面，不少的乡、社干部作风不够民主，一部分干部办事还不够公道，少数干部有贪污腐化和违法乱纪的现象等。也反映了贯彻“勤俭办社、民主办社”的这个方针，我们在工作上还未做到家。对于这些缺点错误，有的及时发现后大都作了纠正或处理，去年11月，中共湖北省委发出指示，各地在深入学习“八大”文件，结合总结工作和整顿作风时，在肯定工作成绩的基础上将曾发生的缺点错误，通过好坏典型对比，再一次进行了较为深刻系统的检查和批判，吸取教训，改进工作，武装了干部思想，所有这些工作，都为进一步巩固农业合作社和争取今年农业生产的更大丰收打下良好基础。
