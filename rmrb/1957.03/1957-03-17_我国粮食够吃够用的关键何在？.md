    Where Lies the Key to Our Country's Food Sufficiency?
    Lin Xi
    The stable situation of food supply in our country in recent years is an undeniable fact. This fact powerfully demonstrates that our country's food production is sufficient for the current consumption level of our people. However, the amount of grain procured in the 1956-1957 grain year has decreased compared to the same period last year, while grain sales have greatly increased compared to last year. Currently, the trend of increasing grain sales nationwide has not stopped. If this trend is allowed to develop, it will inevitably push our grain work into a passive situation.
    The situation of grain sales exceeding procurement is due to complex reasons. Objectively speaking, after agricultural cooperativization, the labor intensity of farmers has increased, so they need to consume more grain. Secondly, last year Hebei, Jilin, Jiangsu, Hunan, Guangxi, Anhui, Henan, and other provinces suffered severe natural disasters, resulting in significant deficits in the national grain procurement and sales plans in these areas. Thirdly, the urban population has increased and proliferated rapidly, which requires more grain to be supplied. However, the more important reason is that we lack a deep understanding of the new situation in grain procurement and sales caused by the fundamental changes in the rural economy (from small-scale peasant economy to agricultural cooperative economy), which has led to a blindly optimistic mood regarding the greatly improved grain situation, resulting in insufficient attention to grain procurement and a general relaxation of sales.
    The purpose of the socialist transformation of agriculture is to liberate agricultural productive forces, which is not in doubt. Last year, although a considerable area of our country suffered severe natural disasters, the realization of agricultural cooperativization, the exploitation of increased production potential, and the improvement of disaster resistance capabilities enabled grain production in 1956 to still increase compared to the bumper year of 1955. However, is it possible for cooperativization to make our country's grain production adapt to the ever-increasing consumption levels of the people in a relatively short period? No. This is because the increase in grain production is always unbalanced between regions and years, especially with varying degrees of disasters occurring every year, so its growth rate is slow; while the increase in grain consumption is comprehensive and the rate is faster.
    So, given the contradiction between the slow growth rate of grain production and the faster growth rate of consumption needs, where lies the key to ensuring our country's food sufficiency?
  Adhere to the "Three Fixes" Policy for Rural Grain
    After agricultural cooperativization, both the production and distribution of grain must go through the agricultural cooperative. Therefore, in grain distribution, there are three relationships: between the state and the agricultural cooperative, between the agricultural cooperative and its members, and between the members themselves.
    According to materials from many regions, the grain reserves of agricultural cooperatives and their members were generally too generous last year. Some regions overemphasized the needs of the masses and adopted measures to reduce the state's unified procurement tasks and increase rural supplies, blindly increasing the amount of grain consumed by farmers. This situation is very unfavorable for the entire country.
    The improvement of farmers' grain consumption should be based on the level of grain production increase, while also taking into account the country's annual growth needs and the special needs of disaster areas. Therefore, the correct distribution principle is that agricultural cooperatives whose actual grain production is roughly equivalent to the "three fixes" production should not reduce the state's procurement tasks or increase the supply to these cooperatives; the state will be responsible for supplying grain to grain-deficient cooperatives whose grain production is lower than the "three fixes" standard according to the local ration standard; in bumper harvest areas, 40% of the increased production should be sold to the state. This will not only meet the increased grain needs of the members, but also allow the state to control more grain during bumper years, so that it can carry out inter-regional or inter-annual surplus and deficiency adjustments nationwide.
    The grain reserves of agricultural cooperatives should adhere to the principles of "first satisfying the needs of the state" and "first ensuring basic needs, then providing for other needs as much as possible." That is, first, it is necessary to ensure the state's procurement tasks and the basic needs of agricultural cooperatives and all members for rations, seeds, and feed, and then the agricultural cooperatives can retain a certain amount of grain for other purposes. The principles currently adopted by some agricultural cooperatives are not like this. They have retained large amounts of grain for developing sideline production. This practice is not in line with the state's policy of unified grain purchase and sale, nor is it in line with the current grain consumption situation in our country.
    The unreasonable distribution of grain between members is an important reason for increasing the state's grain sales to rural areas. According to a typical survey conducted by the grain department of Shandong Province on some surplus grain cooperatives and self-sufficient cooperatives, it was found that about 20% to 30% of the members had insufficient rations. This is mainly because agricultural cooperatives adopted the wrong method of "more work, more gain" in grain distribution, resulting in excessively large differences in grain reserves between members, resulting in those who were allocated too much not being able to eat it all, and those who were allocated too little not having enough to eat. Another situation of unreasonable distribution within agricultural cooperatives is that, regardless of gender, age, or labor strength, rations are distributed equally, resulting in households with many children and elderly people not being able to finish their grain, while households with many laborers not having enough to eat.
    Neither "more work, more gain" nor equal distribution of grain is the correct approach. This will inevitably lead to unequal distribution of food. The only correct way to distribute grain within agricultural cooperatives should be to adopt a pragmatic approach based on not exceeding the state's "three fixes" standard. That is to say, only after ensuring state procurement and meeting the basic ration needs of members can the needs of members with good labor power and high attendance be appropriately taken care of if there is surplus grain.
    Why did many regions report that there was not enough grain last year when grain reserves were generally more abundant in rural areas? According to on-the-spot investigations in many regions, this reflection is directly related to the unreasonable distribution of grain within agricultural cooperatives. In some areas, this reflection has a somewhat false element, which also shows that farmers lack a correct understanding of the state's grain policy. In order to not expand the state's grain sales, in addition to carrying out ideological education on the state's grain policy for farmers, all regions should also actively carry out grain surplus and deficiency adjustment work within agricultural cooperatives. Many regions have achieved success in carrying out adjustments within the cooperatives. For example, after carrying out surplus and deficiency adjustments at the end of January this year, the agricultural cooperatives in Litu Township, Xishui County, Hubei Province, not only solved the problem of more than 159,000 catties of grain shortage for some members, but also had more than 200,000 catties of surplus grain to sell to the state.
    The "three fixes" policy for grain is a lever for regulating the balance between grain production and demand, and supply and demand. We must never easily abandon this effective weapon in the foreseeable future, otherwise it will shake the stable situation of grain in our country.
    Conserve Grain, Control Sales
    In a situation where our country's grain production level is still very low and demand is constantly growing, conserving grain is of great significance. According to reports in various newspapers, the waste of grain is still very serious.
    The Grain Bureau of Xiangtan Prefecture in Hunan Province surveyed 4,144 households in Qinghuapu Township, Ningxiang County. Among them, 3,081 households used grain to brew wine, and 2,040 households used grain to boil sugar, consuming a total of 34,000 catties of rations. Grain consumption in Hubei Province, which had a bumper harvest last year, was even more alarming. For example, during the Spring Festival this year, the average household in Democracy No. 3 and No. 4 cooperatives in Huzhang Township, Mianyang County, used 180 catties of grain for brewing wine, boiling sugar, frying rice bubbles, and making glutinous rice cakes; even more grain was used for weddings and funerals. In the past year, many oil mills, flour mills, and tofu workshops have been restored in rural areas, and some agricultural cooperatives have even opened restaurants, which has consumed a large amount of grain, and at the same time increased the state's supply.
    It is necessary to supply a certain amount of grain to restaurants, noodle shops, and tea snack industries in towns and cities, but because of the premature and excessive emphasis on improving people's lives, the supply to these industries is too generous. Strictly speaking, these grain replicas are generally eaten by people as food for enjoyment, so it cannot but be a waste. Many regions' cakes, baked wheaten cakes, and fried dough sticks have to be sold on credit or promoted to rural areas because of overproduction. The output of Mid-Autumn Festival mooncakes in individual regions can be sold until the end of the year. In the future, this kind of grain consumption must be restricted.
    After the state adjusted the supply of residents' rations in cities in 1956, there was a phenomenon of being too generous. The standard of urban residents' rations was about one to two catties per person per month higher than the actual needs in the second half of 1956. At present, only a small number of towns and cities have made adjustments. Because the supply is too generous, the atmosphere of conservation has gradually faded. The total urban population in the country is about 90 million, and if each person is supplied with one catty of grain more per month, it will be 1.08 billion catties more per year. Therefore, it is very necessary to vigorously rectify and control grain sales in towns and cities. Cities in Beijing, Sichuan, and other places have achieved great results in carrying out rectification work, which also shows that urban sales can be greatly compressed. As for whether each person can save another half a catty to one catty of grain per month after the grain consumption standard is determined? The situation in many regions proves that it is possible.
    Our country is a large country with a population of 600 million. Any waste or conservation of grain will add up to huge numbers. It is an important political task to educate the people to conserve grain and explain the rationale for planned grain consumption.
  Strengthen Grain Dispatch to Balance Needs
    There is an imbalance in grain production in our country between seasons, varieties, and regions, and the years of good harvest and crop failure are unpredictable, and there are new imbalances every year. Therefore, only by strengthening the unified allocation of grain nationwide can we ensure the grain needs of all aspects.
    The general situation of grain production in our country last year was that remote provinces with inconvenient transportation had bumper harvests, many provinces in the central region suffered disasters, and in addition, many provinces had a situation of sales exceeding procurement, so except for remote provinces, the inventories of most provinces were tight to a certain extent, which caused the phenomenon of inflexible grain dispatch. Without affecting the current grain consumption of various provinces, they should obey the central government's unified dispatch of grain, so that the state can avoid problems in the adjustment of seasons, regions, and grain varieties.
    Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and other provinces and regions have greatly increased grain production since liberation (increasing by 13 billion catties of grain last year alone), but because of the inconvenient transportation in these areas, very little grain is transferred out. In the future, efforts should be made to transport more grain from these areas, which will be of great help in alleviating the country's grain needs.

    我国粮食够吃够用的关键何在？
    林晰
    几年来，我国粮食的供应一直保持着稳定的局势，这是有目共睹的事实。这个事实有力地说明我国粮食产量，对我国人民目前的消费水平来说，是够吃够用的。但是，1956—1957粮食年度的征购量与上年度同一时期相比，有了减少，而粮食销量却比上年度大大增加了。目前，全国粮食销售增加的趋势还没有停止下来，这种趋势如果任其发展，必将把我们的粮食工作推向被动的局面。
    形成粮食销售量大于收购量的局面，原因是十分复杂的。从客观上讲，农业合作化以后，农民的劳动强度提高，因此吃粮要多一些；其次去年河北、吉林、江苏、湖南、广西、安徽、河南等省遭受了严重的自然灾害，国家在这些地区的粮食收销计划有了相当大的逆差；再次是城镇人口增加和增殖较快，这些都需要多供应一些粮食。但是更为主要的原因，是我们对农村经济根本变化（小农经济转为农业合作经济）所引起粮食购销的新情况，缺乏深刻的认识，以致在人们思想上产生了对粮食局势大大好转的盲目乐观情绪，因而在粮食收购上抓得不紧，销售上则普遍放松了。
    农业的社会主义改造，目的在于解放农业的生产力，这是没有怀疑的。去年，我国虽然有相当大的地区遭受严重的自然灾害，但由于实现了农业合作化，挖掘了增产潜力，提高了抗灾能力，使1956年粮食产量较丰收的1955年仍然有所增长。但是合作化是否可能在较短的时间内使我国粮食产量和人民不断增长的消费水平相适应呢？不能的。这是因为粮食生产的增长，在地区和年度之间总是不平衡的，特别是每年都会发生程度不同的灾情，因此它的增长速度是缓慢的；而粮食消费的增长则是全面的，速度也是较快的。
    那么，在粮食增产速度缓慢和消费需要增长速度较快的矛盾下，保证我国粮食够吃够用的关键在哪里呢？
  坚持农村粮食“三定”政策
    农业合作化以后，粮食的生产和分配，都必须通过农业社这个环节。因此在粮食分配上，出现了国家同农业社之间，农业社同社员之间，社员同社员之间的三种关系。
    根据很多地区的材料看，去年农业社和社员的粮食留量是偏宽的。有些地区过于强调群众需要，采取了减少国家统购任务和增加农村供应的办法，盲目提高农民的粮食消费数量。这种情况对整个国家来说是很不利的。
    农民粮食消费状况的改善，应该是以粮食增产的水平为基础，同时也要照顾到国家年年增长的需要和灾区的特殊需要。因此，正确的分配原则是，农业社实际粮食产量大体相当于粮食“三定”产量的，不应该减少国家的征购任务或增加对这些社的供应量；粮食产量低于 “三定”标准的缺粮社，国家就根据当地的口粮标准负责供应；在丰收的地区，应该把增产部分的40％卖给国家，这样做既使社员对粮食需要有了增加，同时国家也可以趁丰年时多掌握一些粮食，以便在全国范围内进行地区或年度间余缺的调剂。
    农业社的粮食留量，应该坚持 “首先满足国家的需要”和“先保证基本需要，再量力照顾其他需要”的原则。就是说，首先要保证国家的征购任务，和保证农业社和全体社员的口粮、种子、饲料的基本需要以后，再由农业社留下一定数量的粮食作其他用途。目前有些农业社采取的不是这样的原则，他们留下了大量的粮食，作为发展副业生产，这种做法不符合国家粮食统购统销的政策，也不符合我国当前粮食消费状况。
    社员和社员之间粮食分配不合理，是加大国家对农村粮食销量的重要原因。据山东省粮食部门对一些余粮社和自足社的典型调查，发现有20％—30％左右的社员口粮不足。这主要是农业社在分配粮食上采取了“多劳多得”的错误办法，使社员之间留粮量悬殊过大，造成了多分的吃不了，分少了的不够吃。农业社内分配不合理的另一种情况是，不论男女老幼、劳力强弱，平均主义地分配口粮，结果造成了小孩和老人多的户粮食吃不完，而劳力多的户则不够吃。
    粮食上的“多劳多得”和平均主义的分配都不是正确的作法，这势必形成饱饿不均。农业社内部分配粮食唯一正确的做法，应该是在不超过国家“三定”标准的基础上，采取实事求是的办法分配口粮。就是说，只有在保证国家征购和满足社员基本口粮需要以后，如果还有余粮的话，才能适当地照顾劳动力好和出工多的社员的需要。
    去年各地农村留粮一般较宽裕，为什么还有不少地区反映粮食不够呢？经过很多地区实地调查，这种反映和农业社内部粮食分配不合理有直接关系；在有些地区，这种反映多少带有虚假的成分，这也说明农民对国家粮食政策缺乏正确的认识。为了不扩大国家粮食的销量，各地除应对农民进行国家粮食政策的思想教育以外，还要积极地在农业社内部进行粮食的余缺调剂工作。不少地区在社内进行调剂都取得了成效。像湖北省浠水县栗土乡各农业社，在今年1月底进行余缺调剂后，除解决了部分社员粮食不足数的十五万九千多斤外，还多出余粮二十多万斤卖给国家。
    粮食的“三定”政策，是调节粮食产需平衡、供求平衡的杠杆。我们在今后相当长的时期里决不能轻易地放弃这个有效的武器，否则就会动摇我国粮食稳定的局势。
    节约粮食，控制销量
    在我国粮食生产水平还很低而需要不断增长的情况下，节约粮食有重大的意义。根据各地报纸报道，浪费粮食的情况仍然是很严重的。
    湖南湘潭专署粮食局对宁乡县青华铺乡四千一百四十四户调查，其中用粮食酿酒的有三千零八十一户，熬糖的有二千零四十户，共用口粮三万四千斤。去年丰收的湖北省粮食消耗更为惊人。像沔阳县湖长乡民主三社和四社，仅在今年春节期间、煮酒、熬糖、炒米泡和作粢粑平均每户用粮一百八十斤；在婚丧事件上用粮更多。去年一年中，农村中恢复的油坊、粉坊、豆腐坊等很多，甚至有些农业社开饭铺，这样就耗费了大量的粮食，同时也就加大了国家的供应量。
    对市镇饭馆面食、茶点业供应一定数量的粮食是需要的，但由于过早过多地强调改善人民生活，因此对这些行业的供应量都偏宽。严格地说，这些粮食复制品一般是供人民作为欣赏食品吃掉的，所以不能不是一种浪费。很多地区的糕点、烧饼、油条因为生产过多，不得不赊销或下乡推销。个别地区中秋月饼产量可以销到年底。今后对这种粮食消费必须给予节制。
    1956年国家在城市调整居民口粮供应后，又发生了偏宽的现象。城镇居民定量标准，在1956年下半年大约每人每月高出实际需要量一至两斤。目前还只有小部分城镇作了调整。由于供应偏宽，节约的空气也就逐渐淡薄了。全国市镇人口大约在九千万人左右，按每人每月多供应一斤粮食，一年就多供应十亿八千万斤。因此大力整顿和控制市镇粮食销量是十分必要的。北京、四川等地的城市进行整顿工作收效很大，这也说明城市销量是可以大加压缩的。至于在核定用粮标准以后，是否每人每月可以再节约半斤到一斤粮食呢？不少地区的情况证明是有可能的。
    目前有些市镇的粮食调整工作只停留在机关、学校等集体伙食单位，对居民的调整工作则迟不动手，这是应该纠正的。一般的情况是，城镇分散的居民粮食供应量占到全部供应量的75％左右，不调整居民的定量就收不到显著效果。
    我们国家是六亿人口的大国，在粮食上的任何一点浪费或是节约，都将汇成巨大的数字。向人民群众进行节约用粮的教育，讲明计划用粮的道理是重要的政治工作。
  加强粮食调度以平衡需要
    我国粮食生产上存在着季节间、品种间、地区间的不平衡，加以年景丰歉无常，每年又有新的不平衡现象。因此在全国范围内加强粮食统一调配，才能保证各个方面对粮食的需要。
    去年我国粮食生产的一般情况是，交通不便的边远省份丰收，中心地区不少省遭灾，再加上许多省有销售大于收购的情况，所以除边远省以外，大部分省的库存有一定程度的紧张，这就造成了粮食调度不灵的现象。在不影响各省当前用粮的情况下，应该服从中央统一调度粮食，以便国家能在季节、地区和粮食品种的调剂上不致发生问题。
    云南、四川、贵州、甘肃、青海、新疆、内蒙古等省区在解放以来粮食增产很多（仅去年就比1955年增产了一百三十亿斤粮食），但是由于这些地区的运输不便，粮食调出数量很少，今后应该设法从这些地区多运出一些粮食，这对缓和全国粮食的需要有很大的作用。
