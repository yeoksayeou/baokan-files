If the Screws Are Not Tightened, the Big Wheel Will Be Affected
Sun Ruizhi Hopes That All Departments Will Strengthen the Work of Employees' Families

I am a family member of a railway worker and work on family affairs. I heard Chairman Mao say "Let a hundred flowers bloom," and family work is also one of the flowers, so I want to talk about family work.

Although family members do not directly participate in production, they indirectly participate in production, so family work is very important. If family work is not done well, it will affect the production of employees. What does family work involve? I will briefly report to all the committee members.

Establishing Family Daycare Centers is Good, Economical, and Saves Money; Organizing Parent Committees to Tutor Elementary School Students

As everyone knows, whether it is family members or female employees, they have many children. If the child problem is not solved, all aspects will be affected. Some family members have many children, so they cannot participate in social activities; female employees are often affected by taking care of their children, impacting production. Therefore, our family members established daycare centers. The main advantage of family daycare centers is that they spend less money and solve more problems. There are three types of childcare organizations in our railway department. One is kindergartens, where the superiors subsidize 40 yuan per child per month. One is daycare stations, where the superiors subsidize 25 or 26 yuan per child per month. And in our family-established daycare centers, each child is only subsidized 5 or 6 yuan per month. Some people say, if you spend less money, won't the work be done well? Not at all. The childcare workers are all serving the people. The money is saved, but the work is still done well. Female employees bring their children in the morning and pick them up in the evening. The children are in the daycare center all day. They can play games and eat fruit, and there are also activities during festivals.

Some committee members have already talked about the problem of elementary school students. Now elementary schools implement a two-shift system, with students spending half a day in school and half a day at home. If family work is not done well, and elementary school students are not organized, students will not be tutored, and they will develop bad habits, such as fighting, cursing, and even stealing. Now our family members have organized parent committees to tutor elementary school students, guide them in reviewing their lessons, and organize them to work during the summer vacation (organizing fly-catching teams, cleaning, etc.).

Improving Sanitation to Reduce the Spread of Disease; Mobilizing Families to Learn and Avoid Being Illiterate

Let's talk about sanitation. Now all aspects are being developed, and offices and dormitories are being built. The dormitories are all thousands or hundreds of households. Dormitories with thousands of households have tens of thousands of people living in them, and dormitories with hundreds of households also have thousands of people living in them. If family work is not done well, it will be quite detrimental to sanitation. If sanitation is not good, there will be more flies and mosquitoes. Many flies easily spread gastroenteritis, and many mosquitoes easily spread encephalitis. Therefore, it is necessary to do a good job in personal hygiene and indoor and outdoor sanitation, so that diseases can be reduced.

In terms of learning. Our women were oppressed in the old society, and no one looked up to women, so there were very few women who were educated. In the new society, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao liberated us. We can no longer be illiterate. We must solve the troubles of women, so we mobilize family members to learn to read. Family members learning to read cannot be like being in school, because they have children, and one person has to take care of several children. We mobilize educated family members to teach uneducated family members and organize them to learn to read. In our dormitory, for five or six years, more than four hundred family members have graduated, and those with education have improved a step further. More than thirty family members have been employed, some can read newspapers, and some can write colloquial letters.

Organize Family Mutual Assistance to Overcome Difficulties Together; Carry Out Recreational Activities to Educate Employees' Families

Let's talk about organizing mutual assistance among family members. What are the benefits of mutual assistance? Generally, employees earn dozens of yuan a month and cannot afford to hire a nanny, so they cannot take care of some things at home. As everyone knows, family members have many children, one a year, or one every year or two. Otherwise, if a family member is sick, without a mutual aid group, the employee will have to ask for leave to go home to take care of the family member. Strengthening the mutual aid group, everyone helps each other, and the employee does not have to ask for leave, which can reduce the employee's absenteeism rate. In 1956, a dormitory provided mutual assistance more than six thousand times, totaling more than two thousand days, equivalent to more than seven years of work for one employee.

We also conduct recreational activities. Family members have no culture, and they cannot understand what the government calls for, so we organize them and use various methods to publicize. We established reading groups, where literate people read newspapers to illiterate people, so that everyone knows about national affairs. In terms of recreation, our family members put on some programs and perform for the family members. Family members have children, and it is not easy to go out to see performances. Although our performances are not good, they can also give family members a change of pace and make them know more things. We have performed many programs, such as Peking opera, Ping opera, opera, drama, chorus, and fast-clapper talk. Everyone does whatever they are good at.

There is a lot of family work. I won't talk much about it. This work must rely on activists to drive all the masses and give full play to everyone's potential. Although family work may not play a big role, I often say to everyone that if it cannot play a big role, it can still play a screw role. If the screws are not tightened, the big wheel will be affected. Family work must be done seriously, and family work must be production-oriented. Family work is not easy to do. There are various difficulties. I won't talk much about it. I only hope that the leaders of all departments will attach importance to and support the family work of their departments, strengthen the strength of family work, and strive together for socialism.

### 螺丝钉不巩固，就影响大轮子转  孙瑞芝希望各部门加强职工家属工作

    螺丝钉不巩固，就影响大轮子转
    孙瑞芝希望各部门加强职工家属工作
    我是一个铁路职工的家属，作家属工作。我听毛主席说“百花齐放”，家属工作也是百花里的一朵花，所以我要谈谈家属工作。
    家属虽然不直接参加生产，是间接参加生产，但是家属工作很重要。家属工作如果搞不好，就会影响职工生产。家属工作都搞些什么呢？我简单地向各位委员汇报一下。
    成立家属托儿站又好又省钱组织家长委员会辅导小学生
    大家知道，家属也好，女职工也好，生的孩子很多。孩子问题如果不解决，各方面都会受到影响。有的家属带很多孩子，就不能参加社会活动；女职工往往因为带孩子影响生产。所以，我们家属成立了托儿站。家属托儿站主要是花钱少、解决问题多。我们铁路部门里有三种托儿组织。一种是托儿所，每月每个孩子上级津贴四十元。一种是托儿站，每月每个孩子津贴二十五、六元。而我们家属成立的托儿站，每个孩子每月只津贴五、六元。有人说，花钱少，工作是不是就作得不好了呢？不然。保育员都是为人民服务的，钱省了，工作还是做得不错。女职工白天把孩子送来，晚上把孩子接回去，孩子一天全在托儿站里，做游戏、吃水果都可以办到，过节也有活动。
    关于小学生问题有些委员已经谈过了。现在小学实行二部制，学生半天在学校，半天在家。家属工作如果不作好，不把小学生组织起来，学生没有人辅导，就会养成不好的习惯，打架、骂街，有的还偷盗。现在我们家属已经组织起家长委员会，辅导小学生，指导他们温习功课，暑假组织他们劳动（组织捕蝇队、打扫卫生等）。
    搞好卫生工作减少疾病传染发动家属学习不当睁眼瞎子
    再说卫生方面。现在各方面都进行建设，机关、宿舍都建设起来。宿舍都是几千户、几百户的。几千户的宿舍就有几万人在里头住，几百户的也有几千人住。家属工作如果做得不好，对卫生工作相当有妨碍。卫生不好，苍蝇、蚊子就多了。苍蝇多容易传染肠胃炎，蚊子多容易传染大脑炎。所以要搞好个人卫生、室内外卫生，这样就可以减少疾病。
    在学习方面。我们妇女在旧社会受压迫，没一个人瞧得起妇女，所以妇女有文化的很少。到了新社会，共产党、毛主席把我们解放出来，我们不能再当睁眼瞎子，要解决妇女的苦恼，所以发动家属学文化。家属学文化不能像在学校，因为她们有孩子，一个人要带几个小孩。我们发动有文化的家属教没文化的家属，组织起来学文化。在我们那个宿舍里，五、六年以来，已经有四百多个家属毕业了，有文化的又提高了一步。这里面有三十多个家属已经就业，有的人能看报纸，有的人能写白话信。
    组织家属互助共同克服困难开展文娱活动教育职工家属
    再说组织家属间的互助。互助有什么好处呢？一般职工一个月赚几十块钱，没有钱雇保姆，家里有些事情就管不了。大家知道，家属生小孩多，一年一个，或者隔一两年一个。再不然，家属生病，如果没有互助组，职工就得请假回家照顾家属。加强互助组，大家互相帮助，职工就不用请假，可以减少职工的缺勤率。在1956年，一个宿舍里就互助六千多次、合两千多天，折合一个职工七年多的工作。
    我们还搞文娱活动。家属没有文化，政府有什么号召他们不能领会，我们就组织起来，用种种方法宣传。我们成立了读报小组，识字的人给不识字的人读报，使大家知道国家的事情。在文娱方面，我们家属排了一些节目，演给家属看。家属有孩子，出门看演出不容易，我们演得虽然不好，也可以给家属换换脑筋，使他们多知道一些事情。我们演了许多节目，比如京剧、评剧、歌剧、话剧、清唱、快板，大家会啥搞啥。
    家属工作很多，我不多讲了。这些工作要依靠积极分子，带动所有的群众，发挥大家的潜在力量。家属工作虽说起不了很大作用，但是我常跟大家说，起不了大作用，还可以起螺丝钉作用，螺丝钉不巩固，就要影响大轮子转。家属工作一定要认真搞，家属工作要面向生产。家属工作不是容易搞的，有种种困难，我不多讲了。我只希望各个部门的领导人，对本部门的家属工作要重视和支持，加强家属工作的力量，共同为社会主义奋斗。
