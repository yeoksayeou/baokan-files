Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, March 8th. How to change the face of arid mountainous areas and strive for bumper harvests in arid mountainous areas every year is a major issue facing agricultural production in Gansu Province. Since the first provincial conference on arid mountainous areas was held in 1954, in just two years, 103 of the province's 550 arid townships have basically changed their arid appearance. In the entire arid area with more than 1.8 million people, each person has an average of more than half a mu of irrigated land, 1.6 mu of flood-irrigated land, 1.3 mu of woodland, and half a mu of forage grass land.

Recently, Xinhua News Agency reporters interviewed the person in charge of the Rural Work Department of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, asking him to talk about the experiences and lessons learned in changing the face of aridity.

The person in charge pointed out: According to historical records in Gansu Province for 261 years (1645-1906), there were 114 droughts, an average of once every two years, which shows the frequency and severity of droughts in Gansu. However, at the beginning of liberation, there were 180,000 mu of irrigated land sparsely distributed in the 80,000 square kilometers of arid areas throughout the province, which shows that arid areas can be changed. Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, in 1955 and 1956, vigorous efforts were made to build water conservancy projects in arid mountainous areas, and the area of irrigated land rapidly increased to more than 1.1 million mu.

The person in charge said that to change the face of aridity, it is necessary to grasp the natural environment and natural laws of arid mountainous areas. Gansu's annual rainfall of only 200 to 300 millimeters is usually concentrated in the autumn. After mastering this natural law, we reduced the planting area of summer crops in arid mountainous areas and appropriately expanded the area of autumn crops. As a result, grain production increased significantly. According to statistics from Dingxi Prefecture in 1955, the average yield per mu increased by more than 100 jin. For example, the sand-covered field method we promoted is a special method suitable for drought-prone Gansu Province that can resist drought, retain moisture, keep warm, and suppress alkali. The wheat yield of this kind of sand field is four times higher than that of dry land.

The person in charge said that utilizing all available water sources and maximizing the utilization rate of water is one of the most important reasons for the rapid changes in arid mountainous areas of Gansu Province in recent years. In areas with surface water, a large number of canals were built to divert surface water to develop gravity irrigation. In areas without surface water but with groundwater, wells were dug and springs were tapped to develop water lifting irrigation. In areas without water sources and in areas with bitter water, dry wells and cellars were mainly dug to accumulate and utilize rainwater and floodwater.

The person in charge talked about afforestation as a fundamental way to change the aridity of mountainous areas, saying that afforestation is a long-term plan and it is not easy to see results immediately.

To change aridity, it is also necessary to pay attention to soil and water conservation, as soil erosion is one of the causes of aridity. Soil and water conservation mainly includes two aspects: First, gully and slope management, which should combine gully and slope surfaces for comprehensive management; Second, field engineering, building field ridges, terracing fields, and adopting ridge cultivation methods.

The person in charge finally said that to change aridity, it is also necessary to understand the farming techniques suitable for arid areas and the techniques for building water conservancy projects. Many water-retaining dams built in various places last year were washed away, wasting manpower and money, which shows that we do not understand technology. In the future, to improve the quality of projects, we must train a large number of technical personnel.

    干旱山区的面貌是否可能改变？
    甘肃省的经验肯定地回答了这一问题
    掌握自然规律，利用一切水源，开展植树造林，注意保持水土，就能够改变干旱的山区
    据新华社兰州8日电　怎样改变干旱山区面貌，争取干旱山区年年丰收，是甘肃省农业生产上面临的一个重大问题。自从1954年召开第一次全省干旱山区会议以后，仅两年的时间，全省五百五十个干旱乡中就有一百零三个基本上改变了干旱面貌。整个干旱区一百八十多万人口中，每人平均已有半亩以上水地，一亩六分洪水漫地，一亩三分林地，半亩饲草地。
    最近，新华社记者访问了中共甘肃省委农村工作部负责人，请他谈了在改变干旱面貌中取得的经验和教训。
    这位负责人指出：据甘肃省有历史记载的二百六十一年（1645—1906年）中，曾发生旱灾一百一十四次，平均每两年一次，这说明甘肃的旱灾频繁和严重。但是，解放初期，零星分布在全省八万平方公里的干旱地区的水地却有十八万亩，这说明干旱地区是可以改变的。在各级党委领导下，1955年和1956年在干旱山区大力兴修水利，水地即迅速上升为一百一十多万亩。
    这位负责人说，改变干旱面貌要掌握干旱山区的自然环境和自然规律。甘肃全年仅有的两、三百公厘雨水，通常集中在秋季，我们掌握了这一自然规律后，就将干旱山区的夏季作物播种面积缩小，适当的扩大秋季作物面积。因此粮食产量显著提高，据定西专区1955年统计，平均每亩增产一百多斤。又例如我们推广的铺砂田办法，这是适应甘肃省多旱灾的一种能抗旱、保墒、保温、压碱的特殊办法，这种砂田小麦产量比旱地产量高了四倍。
    负责人说，利用一切可以利用的水源，把水的利用率提到最高程度，是甘肃省干旱山区几年来迅速变化的最重要原因之一。在有地面水的地区，大量兴修渠道，引用地面水发展自流灌溉。在无地面水有地下水的地区，普遍打井、淘泉，发展提水灌溉。在无水源地区和苦水地区，主要打旱井和窑窖，积蓄和利用雨水和洪水。
    这位负责人谈到植树造林是改变山区干旱的根本办法时说，植树造林是百年大计，一时不易见到效果。
    要改变干旱还要注意保持水土，水土流失是干旱的成因之一。保持水土主要包括两方面：一、沟坡治理，要沟面结合，综合治理；二、田间工程，培地埂，修梯田，采用垅作区田方法。
    负责人最后说，改变干旱也要懂得适应干旱地区的耕作技术和兴修水利的技术。去年各地兴修的许多拦水大坝被冲垮，劳民伤财，说明我们不懂技术。今后要提高工程质量，就必须大量培养技术人员。
