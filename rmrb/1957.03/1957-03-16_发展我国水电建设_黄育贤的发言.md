Developing China's Hydropower Construction
Huang Yuxian's Speech

	We have accumulated some experience in building small and medium-sized hydropower stations in recent years – China has many favorable conditions for developing hydropower construction – National economic construction departments should appropriately arrange hydropower investment – Build hydropower stations diligently and thriftily – Learn from advanced world experience and build large hydropower stations well.
	I warmly support Chairman Mao's instructions and Premier Zhou's report. I also agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report of the Standing Committee, and Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech on increasing production and practicing economy.

	Now let me talk about how to actively develop China's hydropower construction industry. In recent years, China's hydropower construction, like other industrial constructions, has made significant achievements. To date, we have renovated and expanded the Fengman and Jingpohu hydropower stations in the Northeast, and the Shangqingyuandong hydropower station in Sichuan. The new hydropower stations we have built mainly include more than ten small and medium-sized hydropower stations such as Guanting on the Yongding River, Shizitan in Sichuan, Shangyoujiang in Jiangxi, Liuxihe in Guangdong, Gutianxi in Fujian, Huangtankou in Zhejiang, and Moshikou near Beijing. Among them, Guanting, Shizitan, Gutian, Moshikou, as well as Ulabo in Xinjiang and Lhasa in Tibet, have been completed and started generating electricity in 1955 and 1956. From 1953 to the end of 1956, approximately 450,000 kilowatts of newly installed hydropower capacity has been put into system operation, and it is estimated that the hydropower capacity put into system operation in 1957 will reach approximately 700,000 kilowatts. Through the construction of this batch of hydropower stations, we have explored and accumulated some experience in various aspects from resource surveying to design and construction, from organizational leadership to technical management, from equipment manufacturing to electromechanical installation, and improved our technical level. With the development of the country's socialist industrialization and the continuous growth of hydropower construction forces, China's hydropower construction will further develop. It will play an increasingly significant role in China's national economic construction.

	Below I would like to focus on how to further develop China's hydropower construction and the proportion of the power industry in the entire industrial construction:

	The power industry is one of the leading industries for national industrialization. Without electricity, it is difficult to talk about industrialization. In recent years, China's power industry has made great progress, but it still cannot meet the needs of the entire industrial development. Currently, more than 30 regions are short of electricity, which is a relatively serious situation and cannot be improved in the short term. The main reason is that the investment arrangements for the power industry in the First Five-Year Plan were not appropriate enough. From the perspective of the distribution of investment in basic construction, the average growth rate of investment from 1953 to 1955 was the lowest in the power industry among all industrial sectors. Taking 1952 as the base period, the average growth rate of total industrial investment from 1953 to 1955 was 44%, while electricity was only 37%, coal 46%, petroleum 84%, non-ferrous metal mining and smelting 61%, metal processing 50%, and machinery manufacturing 50%. Therefore, the comparison between the development speed of the power industry and the overall industrial development is the lowest in China compared with other countries in the world. In the first three years of the First Five-Year Plan, if the development speed of the entire industry is 1, then the development speed of the power industry in the same period is 0.85. Other countries in the world are higher than this figure, including the Soviet Union 0.88, the United States 1.35, the United Kingdom 1.25, France 1.09, and Japan 1.17. China's power industry is lower than major products such as steel and pig iron, while the power production of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries is higher than other products. Therefore, in the Second Five-Year Plan, investment in the power industry must be appropriately arranged so that it can truly take the lead, otherwise it may affect the development of the entire industry.

	In China's power industry, hydropower construction is an important component. Compared with other countries in the world, China's water resources have many unique advantages. First of all, the geographical location is moderate and advantageous. The rivers with abundant water resources in the country are relatively evenly distributed throughout the country. Almost all industrial areas and densely populated areas in the country are located within the range that can be supplied by hydropower. The areas with relatively few coal reserves in China are precisely the areas with particularly abundant water resources. Superior topographical and geological conditions, with many narrow valley areas in the rivers, small civil engineering volume, and low cost, are the special advantages of China's hydropower development. In other countries, hydropower investment is generally two to four times more expensive than thermal power, while in China, large and medium-sized hydropower stations are not much more expensive than thermal power, and some are even cheaper than thermal power. For example, the cost per kilowatt of the Liujiaxia and Yilihe hydropower stations is only 650 yuan and 750 yuan, respectively, which is cheaper than building thermal power stations. Experience over the years has proved that the construction speed of China's hydropower stations can also be fast. The Shizitan hydropower station is quite large in terms of engineering volume, and the entire construction period was only 26 months. The Shangyou hydropower station is expected to be completed and generate electricity this autumn in just two and a half years. Based on these favorable conditions, the policy of gradually making hydropower the mainstay of China's power industry in the future is correct. Currently, hydropower accounts for about 20% of the entire power industry, and it is estimated that it will increase to 28% by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan and 40% by the end of the Third Five-Year Plan. This ratio is appropriate. The problem lies in how we can complete it as expected according to this ratio, which inevitably involves the issue of hydropower investment.

	One of the characteristics of hydropower construction is that, in addition to power generation, it often has comprehensive benefits in flood control, irrigation, navigation, and water supply. How to reasonably allocate the total investment in hydropower construction based on the various comprehensive benefits of hydropower stations is still a scientific research problem without a conclusion, but this problem does exist. For example, in the Yellow River plan, it was once suggested that one-third of the investment in Sanmenxia should be allocated to power generation, and one-half of the investment in Liujiaxia should be allocated to power generation. Of course, we do not necessarily require such clear apportionment of investment in these comprehensive projects between various government departments at present. In fact, such apportionment also has certain difficulties, but the department in charge of the country's overall economic construction should consider these factors when allocating investment in the power industry, especially in hydropower. Sometimes, building hydropower stations can save the country a portion of investment in coal mines and a large amount of railway investment required for coal transportation. The national leading departments that comprehensively manage the overall situation must also consider these investment savings when allocating hydropower investment. In short, hydropower investment should be appropriately arranged and resolved so that China's particularly advantageous hydropower construction can receive the necessary development.

	Next, I would also like to talk about how to build hydropower stations diligently and thriftily. Adopting new technologies, establishing a thrifty design concept, and strengthening construction management are the keys to this issue. We have done some work in this regard in the past, and we plan to further educate hydropower workers in the future to establish a mindset of considering economy for everyone. Secondly, fully utilizing domestic equipment and local raw materials to reduce foreign exchange is also an important aspect of saving. Of course, building hydropower stations, because of the narrow terrain, large amount of engineering, short construction time, and the struggle with river water, requires a high degree of mechanization. However, some work can be done manually, and labor should be utilized as much as possible, because China has a large labor force, which can also reduce engineering costs and increase employment opportunities for the people. In addition, we can also consider establishing construction bases for hydropower stations at appropriate locations to provide housing for employees' families and establish an appropriate worker vacation system so that they can return home to visit their families. In this way, employees can try not to bring their families, and temporary buildings can be greatly reduced. As for reorganizing design, construction, and management institutions, and streamlining personnel is also very important. All of these are feasible and effective methods. In short, we should do everything possible to strive for the diligent and thrifty construction of hydropower stations.

	Premier Zhou pointed out in his report on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy at the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "During the Second Five-Year Plan period, we must continue to build industrial bases centered on the iron and steel industry in Central China and Inner Mongolia, and actively build new industrial bases centered on the iron and steel industry and large hydropower stations in Southwest China, Northwest China, and around Sanmenxia..." This policy is correct. The large hydropower stations that China has been building and will build, such as Sanmenxia, Liujiaxia, Xin'anjiang, Yilihe, Minjiang, Wanjiazhai, Wuqiangxi, and Danjiangkou, are proposed according to this policy. However, these large projects are all at the international level and require a lot of scientific research and experimental work, and require further improvement of our technical level. Therefore, we must strengthen our learning from Soviet experts and experts from people's democratic countries, learn from all experiences from other countries in the world that are helpful to us, and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity in our work, so as to accelerate the progress of China's hydropower construction and contribute all our strength to the country's socialist industrialization.

    发展我国水电建设
    黄育贤的发言
    几年来我们已经积累了建设中小型水电站的一些经验——我国有许多发展水电建设的优越条件——国家经济建设部门应当适当安排水电投资——勤俭建设水电站——学习世界先进经验，把大水电站建好
    我热诚地拥护毛主席的指示和周总理的报告。并同意李富春副总理对于第二个五年计划建议的说明和陈叔通副主席所作的常务委员会工作报告以及陈云副总理关于增产节约的发言。
    现在让我谈谈关于如何积极发展我国水力发电建设事业的问题。几年来，我国水电建设事业与其他工业建设一样，也取得了显著的成绩。至目前为止，我们改建和扩建完成的有东北丰满、镜泊湖和四川的上清渊洞等水电站。我们新建的水电站主要有永定河上的官厅、四川的狮子滩、江西的上犹江、广东的流溪河、福建的古田溪、浙江的黄坛口、北京附近的模式口等十多个中小型水电站，其中官厅、狮子滩、古田、模式口以及新疆的乌拉泊和西藏的拉萨等水电站，已于1955和1956年先后建成发电。1953年至1956年底为止，已经投入系统运转新安装起来的水电容量约四十五万瓩，预计到1957年投入系统运转的水电容量将达七十万瓩左右。通过这一批水电站的建设，从资源勘测到设计施工，从组织领导到技术管理，从设备制造到机电安装等各方面，都摸索和积累了一些经验，提高了技术水平。随着国家社会主义工业化的发展，随着水电建设力量的不断成长，我国水电建设事业还将进一步的发展。它在我国国民经济建设中将起着越来越显著的作用。
    下面我想着重谈谈如何进一步发展我国水电建设和电力工业在整个工业建设比重问题：
    电力工业是国家工业化的先行工业之一，没有电就很难谈工业化。几年来我国电力工业是有很大发展的，但还不能适应整个工业发展的需要，目前有三十多个地区缺电，这种情况是比较严重的，在短期内还不能改善的，主要原因是由于第一个五年计划关于电力工业投资的安排还有不够适当的地方。从基本建设投资额的分配来看，1953年到1955年投资平均增长速度在各工业部门中以电力工业为最低。如以1952年为基期，1953年到1955年全部工业投资平均增长速度为44％，而电力只37％，其他煤炭46％，石油84％，有色金属采掘及冶炼61％，金属加工50％，机器制造50％。因此电力工业和全部工业发展速度的对比，与世界各国情况比较，也以我国为最低。在第一个五年计划的前三年中，如以整个工业发展的速度为1，则同一时期内电力工业的发展速度为0.85。而世界其他各国均高于此数，其中苏联0.88，美国1.35，英国1.25，法国1.09，日本为1.17。我国电力工业低于钢、生铁等主要产品，而苏联、美国、英国等的电力生产均高于其他产品。因此在第二个五年计划中必须适当安排电力工业的投资，使它真正地能先行一步，否则恐将会影响整个工业的发展的。
    在我国电力工业中，水电建设是重要的组成部分。我国水力资源与世界各国比起来，是有很多独特的优点的。首先是地理位置适中，左右逢源。全国水力资源丰富的河流，相当均匀地分布于全国各地，几乎全国工业区及人口稠密区，都位于可能由水电来供电的范围内。我国煤藏较少的地区，恰是水力资源特别丰富的地区。地形地质条件优越，河流多狭谷地区，土建工程量小，造价便宜，是我国水力开发的特殊优点。世界各国水电投资一般比火电要贵二—四倍，而我国大中型水电站比火电贵不多，有的比火电还要便宜。如刘家峡和以礼河两水电站每瓩造价只六百五十元和七百五十元，就比建设火电站还便宜。几年来的经验证明，我国水电站建设的速度也是能够快的，狮子滩水电站按工程量来说是相当大的，整个施工期间只有二十六个月，上犹水电站预计今年秋季完成发电也只要两年半。根据这些优越条件，今后我国电力工业逐步以水电为主的方针是正确的。目前水电在整个电力工业中的比重约为20％，预计第二个五年计划末和第三个五年计划末将提高到28％和40％，这个比例是适合的，问题在于我们如何能按这个比例预期完成，这就不得不牵涉到关于水电的投资问题。
    水电建设的特点之一，是它除了发电而外，往往还具有防洪、灌溉、航运、给水等各方面的综合效益，如何根据水电站的各项综合效益来合理的分配水电建设全部投资，还是一个没有定论的科学研究问题，但是这一问题的确是存在的。譬如在黄河规划中，即曾建议将三门峡投资的三分之一摊入发电，将刘家峡投资的二分之一摊入发电。当然我们目前并不一定要求在各政府部门之间如此分明地来分摊这些综合性工程的投资，事实上这样的分摊也有一定困难，但是在掌握国家总的经济建设的部门，在分配电力工业特别是水电投资时，希望能考虑到这些因素。有时候由于建设水电站，可以为国家节省一部分的煤矿投资和大量运煤所需的铁路投资，对这些投资上的节约，统筹全面的国家领导部门在分配水电投资时也必须加以考虑。总之水电投资应当适当安排和解决，以便使我国特殊有利的水电建设得到必要的发展。
    下面我还想谈谈如何勤俭建设水电站的问题。采用新技术，树立节约的设计思想，和加强施工管理是这个问题的关键。关于这点我们过去做了一些工作，今后还准备进一步教育水电工作人员，树立人人考虑经济的思想。其次，充分利用国内设备和当地原材料，减少外汇，也是节约的重要环节，当然建筑水电站，因为地形狭窄，工程量大，施工时间短且与河水作斗争，是需要高度的机械化的，但有些工作可以用人力，就应该尽量利用劳动力，因为我国劳动力多，这样也可以降低工程造价增加人民就业的机会。此外还可以考虑适当地点建立水电站的建筑基地，以备职工眷属居住，建立适当的工人休假制度以便回家省亲。这样，职工可以尽量不带家属，临时建筑物就可以大大减少；至于整顿设计、施工和管理机构，精简人员也是很重要的。所有这些都是可行而有效的办法。总之，我们应该想尽一切办法为勤俭建设水电站而努力。
    周总理在党的第八次大会上关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议的报告中指出：“在第二个五年计划期间，必须继续进行华中和内蒙古两地区以钢铁工业为中心的工业基地的建设，积极进行西南、西北和三门峡周围等地区以钢铁工业和大型水电站为中心的新工业基地的建设……”这个方针是正确的。目前我国已在和将要建设的三门峡、刘家峡、新安江、以礼河、岷江、万家寨、五强溪、丹江口等大水电站，就是根据这个方针而提出的。然而这些大工程都是属于国际水平的工作，需要做很多科学研究和实验工作，需要进一步提高我们的技术水平，因此我们更要加强向苏联专家及人民民主国家专家学习，向世界其他各国所有对我们有帮助的经验学习，充分发挥我们工作中的积极性和创造性，使我国水电建设事业加速前进，为国家社会主义工业化而贡献出我们的一切力量。
