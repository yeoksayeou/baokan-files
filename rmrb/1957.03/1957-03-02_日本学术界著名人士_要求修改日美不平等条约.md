Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 1st: On February 28th, the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Japan-U.S. "Administrative Agreement," six hundred prominent Japanese scientists and cultural figures issued a statement demanding the revision of unequal treaties between Japan and the United States.

The statement said that the reason why bloody tragedies like the one in Sunagawa often occur is due to the existence of unequal treaties such as the "Security Treaty" and "Administrative Agreement" between Japan and the United States. The statement believes that revising these unequal treaties is a matter of great importance to Japan's future. The statement called on the Japanese people, regardless of their political views or ideology, to support and assist this view and movement.

Signatories to the statement include Hiroshi Suekawa, President of Ritsumeikan University, Gen Tanabe, a member of the Japan Academy, Sakae Azuma, Professor of Tokyo University, physicist Shoichi Sakata, and writer Tatsuzo Ishikawa.
