　　Defeat the Vicious Attacks of Reactionary Groups
　　Italian Communist Party Increases Votes in Provincial and Municipal Elections
    Xinhua News Agency, 27th: Rome News: Local autonomous institution elections were held in many parts of Italy on the 24th. In these elections, despite the fierce offensive launched by reactionary groups with the support of the church, the Italian Communist Party maintained and consolidated its position in many regions, gaining more votes than in previous elections.
    In the election for the Cremona Municipal Committee, the votes obtained by the Communists increased from 8,559 in the past to 9,787, and the number of seats also increased by two compared to the past. Therefore, although the votes obtained by the Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party decreased somewhat, the left-wing party alliance—Communists, Socialists, and Social Democrats—still achieved an absolute majority in the Cremona City Council.
    In the election of new members of the Provincial Political Committee held in a district of Naples, the number of votes obtained by the Communist candidate also increased from 21.8% of the total votes to 25.1%.
    In Marano (Province of Naples), Arenzano (Province of Genoa), and other places, the number of voters supporting the Communist Party also increased.

　　击败反动集团的凶恶攻击
　　意共在省市选举中选票增加
    新华社27日讯　罗马消息：意大利许多地方在24日举行了地方自治机构选举。在这些选举中，尽管反动集团在教会的支持下发动了凶猛的攻势，意大利共产党还是在许多地区保持和巩固了自己的阵地，比以往的选举获得更多的选票。
    在克利蒙纳市政委员会的选举中，共产党人获得的选票从过去的八千五百五十九票增加到九千七百八十七票，而席位也比以往增加了两席。因此，虽然社会党和社会民主党所得选票有所减少，左翼政党联盟——共产党人、社会党人和社会民主党人——在克利蒙纳的市议会中仍取得了绝对多数。
    在那不勒斯一个地区里举行的省政委员会新委员的选举中，共产党候选人所得到的票数也从总票数的21.8％增加到25.1％。
    在马拉诺（那不勒斯省），阿伦扎诺（热那亚省）以及其他地方，支持共产党的选民也增加了。
