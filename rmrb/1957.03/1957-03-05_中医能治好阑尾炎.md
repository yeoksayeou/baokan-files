Traditional Chinese Medicine Can Cure Appendicitis

    This newspaper reports that Li Shuanglin, a Traditional Chinese Medicine doctor at the Northeast Workers' Hospital, has successfully treated forty patients with appendicitis using traditional Chinese medicine.

    Traditional Chinese Medicine doctor Li Shuanglin has been practicing medicine for over thirty years. He originally had a private practice in Shenhe District and had treated many appendicitis patients. In October 1956, he went to the Northeast Workers' Hospital to serve as the director of the Traditional Chinese Medicine outpatient department. He used traditional Chinese medicine to treat appendicitis patients hospitalized at the hospital with very good results. Generally, appendicitis patients can be cured and discharged from the hospital after taking medicine for three to five days. According to preliminary statistics, up to now, more than 90% of the forty hospitalized appendicitis patients (including chronic, acute, and subacute cases, with conditions ranging from mild, moderate and severe) treated by traditional Chinese medicine have achieved positive results.
