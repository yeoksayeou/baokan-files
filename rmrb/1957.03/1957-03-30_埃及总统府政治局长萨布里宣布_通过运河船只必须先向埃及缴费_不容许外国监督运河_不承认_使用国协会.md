Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 29th: Sabri, Director of the Political Bureau of the Egyptian Presidential Palace, told a "People's Daily" reporter on March 28th that the Suez Canal will be reopened to large ships on April 10th, and all detailed regulations regarding transit procedures will be announced around April 4th.

    He said: Egypt has decided that ships passing through the canal should pay the canal transit fees to the Egyptian Suez Canal Authority in advance. Payment procedures should be handled in Egypt or paid to any bank designated by the Canal Authority.

    Sabri said that Egypt would never allow foreign countries to supervise the canal in any way. He said that the maintenance and improvement of the canal are within the responsibility of the Egyptian Suez Canal Authority. The Canal Authority guarantees good management of the canal at the highest efficiency level.

    He said that improving the canal is the policy of the Egyptian government, as it is beneficial to both the international community and Egypt's economy. The Egyptian government will allocate a portion of all transit fees collected for the purpose of improving the canal. This amount will definitely exceed the appropriations of the former Suez Company.

    When talking about the Canal "Users' Association," Sabri said that the Egyptian government has never recognized this organization because it only includes a portion of the user countries and does not include most countries with ships or goods passing through the canal. He said that as long as British and French ships abide by the regulations and procedures followed by ships of other countries, the Egyptian government will not favor one over the other.

　　埃及总统府政治局长萨布里宣布
　　通过运河船只必须先向埃及缴费
　　不容许外国监督运河  不承认“使用国协会”
    据新华社开罗29日电  埃及总统府政治局长萨布里3月28日对“人民报”记者发表谈话说，苏伊士运河将在4月10日重新向大型船只开放，关于通行手续的全部细节规定将在4月4日左右公布。
    他说：埃及已经作出决定：通过运河的船只应该事先向埃及苏伊士运河管理局缴纳运河通行费，付款手续应该在埃及办理，或是向运河管理局所指定的任何银行缴纳。
    萨布里说，埃及绝不容许外国对运河进行任何监督。他说，运河的保养和改善工作是埃及苏伊士运河管理局的责任范围内的事。运河当局保证在最高效率水平上对运河良好管理。
    他说，改善运河，是埃及政府的政策，因为这对于国际社会和埃及的经济都是有利的。埃及政府将从自己征收的全部通行费中，拨出一部分作为改善运河的计划之用。这笔款项肯定地将超过前苏伊士公司的拨款。
    在谈到运河“使用国协会”时，萨布里说，埃及政府没有承认过这个组织，因为它只包括了一部分使用国，而没有包括有船只或商品通过运河的大多数国家。他说，只要英法两国的船只遵守其他国家船只遵守的规章和手续，埃及政府就不会厚此薄彼。
