Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, March 13th. State-owned farms and many agricultural cooperatives on both banks of the Zuojiang and Youjiang rivers in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture are stepping up land reclamation and digging pits to plant coffee. The total area planted with coffee in the prefecture this year will be twenty times larger than last year.

In order to further develop coffee planting next year, the Guangxi Provincial Land Reclamation Department has transported 4,000 jin of coffee seeds from Yunnan for seedling cultivation. State-owned farms such as the Pioneer Farm, which focus on developing tropical and subtropical crops, have sown more than 2,000 jin of coffee seeds.

The Zuojiang and Youjiang river banks have fertile and moist soil, with little difference in temperature throughout the four seasons, and an annual rainfall of over 1,500 millimeters. Farmers of all ethnic groups in Longjin, Jingxi and other counties have a history of coffee planting for more than 30 years. Coffee trees in Longbang District of Jingxi County generally produce two to five jin of dry beans per plant per year, with a maximum of over twenty jin.

    僮族自治州扩大咖啡种植
    新华社南宁13日电  桂西僮族自治州左江、右江两岸的国营农场和许多农业社，正加紧开荒挖坑种植咖啡。全州今年种植咖啡面积将比去年扩大二十倍。
    为了明年进一步发展咖啡种植，广西省垦殖厅今年已从云南运来四千斤咖啡种子，进行育苗。国营先锋等十个以发展热带亚热带作物为主的农场，已播下咖啡种子两千多斤。
    左江、右江两岸土壤肥沃湿润，四季气温相差不大，全年雨量在一千五百公厘以上。龙津、靖西等县各族农民种植咖啡已有三十多年的历史。靖西县龙邦区的咖啡树一般每株年产干豆二到五斤，最高达二十多斤。
