Tan Yizhi's Advice to Taiwan Military and Government Personnel:
It's Time to Wake Up from Illusions

　　In the past few days, I have listened to Chairman Mao's report at the Supreme State Conference, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report at the preparatory meeting, and Chairman Zhou Enlai's and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's reports at this conference. These reports not only raised my ideological level but also increased my infinite confidence in the future of world peace and the future of our country's socialist industrialization. I believe that these reports will further inspire the people of the whole country to march confidently towards the goal of socialist industrialization under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao!

　　Now I want to talk about the issue of the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. In recent years, the Taiwan authorities have not only relied on U.S. aid economically but also had to depend on the protection of the U.S. Navy and Air Force militarily. Historical facts tell us that anyone who relies on imperialism to maintain their survival will ultimately end up discredited. Wang Jingwei is a prominent example. The rampant and domineering behavior of American soldiers in Taiwan, treating themselves as masters, is not only deeply hated by the people of Taiwan, but also causes any Kuomintang military and government personnel with a bit of backbone to gnash their teeth. U.S. imperialism always acts based on its own interests. It does not favor the Taiwan authorities, nor does it favor the pro-American so-called democratic and liberal elements or the so-called Taiwan independence movement elements. What the United States is most interested in is Taiwan as a military base. As for today's Taiwan authorities and all those who seek glory by betraying the country, in the eyes of the United States, they are merely political tools. Therefore, when U.S. imperialists believe that a certain tool has a greater function, they will use it. Once they believe that a certain tool has lost its usefulness, they will discard it. The recent "Support America, Oppose Chiang" activities planned by the United States should be a serious warning to those who still harbor illusions about the United States. Some Taiwan newspapers have lamented this, saying, "Being at the mercy of others, there is always the danger of being sold out." This is very natural. But today's Taiwan authorities are not trying to extricate themselves from U.S. control. They are still chanting empty rhetoric about counterattacking the mainland, which is essentially fawning over U.S. imperialism. However, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, 600 million Chinese people are united like giants, working for the great cause of socialist industrialization. Moreover, today our national defense strength has far surpassed that of the period of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. Any attempt to shake the people's regime is forever impossible. Due to our country's increasing strength and the correctness of our diplomatic line, our country's international status has been raised to an unprecedented level. Premier Zhou Enlai's recent visit to eleven countries in Europe and Asia fully demonstrated the active role our country plays in international affairs. In the face of these ironclad facts, even within the U.S. ruling clique, more and more people believe that the existence of the great People's Republic of China cannot be denied in the long term. Historical facts have educated the people. They have personally experienced which government in the past century has been able to drive the forces of imperialism out of China? Which government has been able to transform China from weak to strong? Which government has been able to lead the entire Chinese people to build the country to such great achievements in seven years? It is no accident that the people of the whole country regard the Communist Party as their savior. Today, U.S. imperialism is the last and most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people's century-long struggle for liberation, and Taiwan is the last piece of Chinese territory under imperialist control. Therefore, what lies before the Taiwan authorities today is not the issue of anti-communism but the issue of betraying the country or loving the country. It is very clear that if the Taiwan authorities continue to depend on the U.S. imperialists and are enemies of the people of the whole country, the result will be, as Chairman Zhou Enlai said at this conference, "Seeking glory by betraying the country will not only gain no glory but will also leave a stench for ten thousand years." I believe that the Taiwan military and government personnel with a bit of backbone will never be willing to do this. I would like to advise the Taiwan authorities here that now is the time to wake up from illusions. Face reality and reconsider your own destiny! The Communist Party and the Kuomintang have cooperated twice in history. Can't we cooperate once again today for the final unification of the motherland?

　　I hope that my old friends in Taiwan will no longer procrastinate at this crucial moment of deciding their own destiny. For the benefit of the country and the nation, and also for your own benefit, you should actively promote the Taiwan authorities to respond to the call of the Central People's Government for peaceful negotiations and return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible, so as to complete the final task of driving imperialism out of Chinese territory, which has been the goal of the Chinese people for a century! Many of those attending and observing the National People's Political Consultative Conference today are former military and government personnel. Our relationship with the Communist Party is to serve the cause of socialist construction together under the principle of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision. Because socialist industrialization is the common cause of 600 million people and is by no means the private matter of a certain party or faction. As long as the military and government personnel in Taiwan are determined to return, they can not only reunite with their families and relatives but also have the opportunity to serve the socialist cause like us. The door of the motherland is open to all patriots. Family members and relatives on the mainland are waving to you, hoping that you will turn back from the control of the U.S. imperialists and from your bitter lives as soon as possible!

### 覃异之奉告台湾军政人员：应该是从幻想中清醒过来的时候了

　　覃异之奉告台湾军政人员：
　　应该是从幻想中清醒过来的时候了
    几天来，我听了毛主席在最高国务会议上的报告，李富春副总理在预备会议上的报告，周恩来主席、陈叔通副主席在这次大会上的报告。这几个报告，不仅提高了我的思想水平，并且使我对世界和平的前途、对我国建设社会主义工业化的前途增加了无限信心。我相信，这几个报告将进一步鼓舞全国人民，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，满怀信心地向社会主义工业化的目标迈进！
    现在我想谈关于和平解放台湾的问题。几年来，台湾当局，不仅在经济上依赖美援过日，就是在军事上也不得不依赖美国海空军的保护。历史的事实告诉我们，凡是依赖帝国主义以维持生存的，最后没有不身败名裂。汪精卫就是显著的例子。美国军人在台湾的横行霸道，以主子自居，不仅台湾人民恨之刺骨，稍有血性的国民党军政人员，也会咬牙切齿的。美帝国主义，一切都以它自己的利益出发，它不仅对台湾当局无所偏爱，就是对亲美的所谓民主自由分子，和所谓台湾独立运动分子，也不会有所偏爱的，美国所最感兴趣的是台湾这个军事基地。至于今天的台湾当局以及一切卖国求荣的人，在美国看来，不过是它的政治工具罢了。所以当美帝国主义者认为某个工具作用比较大时，就利用这个工具，一旦认为某个工具失去了效用时，就把这个工具抛弃掉。近来美国策划的“拥美反蒋”活动，给那些对美国还存幻想的人，应该是一个严重的警告。某些台湾报纸曾为此感叹地说：“俯仰由人，终有被出卖的危险。”这是很自然的。但今天的台湾当局，不是力图从美国的控制下自拔出来，还在高唱着反攻大陆的空论，实质上是对美帝国主义摇尾乞怜。可是六亿中国人民却在中国共产党领导下，正在为社会主义工业化这一伟大事业，团结得像巨人一般，况且今天我们的国防力量，已远远超过了抗美援朝时期，任何企图动摇人民政权的幻想，都是永远不可能实现的。由于我们的国力日益壮大，加以外交路线的正确，我国的国际地位空前提高了。最近周恩来总理访问欧亚十一个国家的经过中，充分显示了我国在国际事务中所起的积极作用。在这种铁的事实面前，即使美国统治集团中，也越来越多地有人认为，不能长期地否认伟大的中华人民共和国的存在。历史的事实教育了人民，他们亲身体会到，百年来哪一个政府能把帝国主义的力量驱逐出中国？哪一个政府能把中国由弱变强？哪一个政府能领导全中国人民在七年内把国家建设得这样伟大的成绩？全国人民把共产党当作救星，这不是偶然的。今天美帝国主义是中国人民百年来解放斗争的最后一个凶恶的敌人，而台湾是帝国主义控制下中国的最后一块领土。所以今天摆在台湾当局面前的，不是反共的问题，而是卖国与爱国的问题。很显然的，如果台湾当局继续依附美帝，与全国人民为敌，其结果将如周恩来主席在这次大会上所说的，“卖国求荣，不仅无荣可得，而且还将遗臭万年。”我相信有血性的台湾军政人员，决不甘心这样做的。我愿在这里奉告台湾当局，现在应该是从幻想中清醒过来的时候了。正视现实，重新考虑自己的命运吧！共产党与国民党在历史上曾有过两次的合作，难道今天就不能为祖国的最后统一，再一次合作吗？
    我希望台湾的旧朋友们，在这决定自己的命运关头，千万莫再因循苟且了。为了国家民族的利益，也是为你们本身的利益，应该积极起来，促成台湾当局，响应中央人民政府和平谈判的号召，早日回到祖国的怀抱来，以完成百年来中国人民驱逐帝国主义出中国领土的最后任务！今天出席和列席全国人民政治协商会议的，有许多都是过去的军政人员，我们和共产党的关系，是在长期共存、互相监督的方针下，共同为社会主义建设事业服务。因为社会主义工业化，是六亿人民的共同事业，绝不是某党某派的私事。只要台湾的军政人员有决心回来，不仅可以和家人亲友团聚，而且也将与我们一样，有机会为社会主义事业服务。祖国的大门是为一切爱国者开着的，大陆的家人亲友在向你们招手，希望你们从美帝的控制下，从苦闷的生活中，早日回头罢！（附图片）
