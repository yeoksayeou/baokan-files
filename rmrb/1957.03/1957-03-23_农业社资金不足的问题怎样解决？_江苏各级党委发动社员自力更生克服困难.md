How to Solve the Problem of Insufficient Funds in Agricultural Cooperatives?
　　Jiangsu Party Committees at All Levels Mobilize Members to Overcome Difficulties Through Self-Reliance

　　(Our Newspaper Dispatch) The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committees at all levels recently put forward the call of "Self-Reliance, Overcoming Difficulties," requiring agricultural cooperatives in various places to mobilize members to invest in the cooperatives, in order to solve the current difficulty of insufficient production funds.

　　Last year was the first year of agricultural collectivization. Many agricultural cooperatives had little public accumulation and a weak foundation. During the year-end distribution, some regions one-sidedly emphasized "less deduction and more distribution;" some agricultural cooperatives had many overspending households, and they could not return the money in a short time; some cooperatives increased investment in sideline production in order to vigorously develop it. Therefore, the lack of funds in agricultural cooperatives was relatively common. Only 285 out of 451 cooperatives in Qidong County had some funds, and the rest were "empty-handed." Xinmin Cooperative in Zhenze County had 762 mu of land urgently needing topdressing, 30,000 mu of mulberry land urgently needing to purchase seedlings, and 13 fish ponds needing to be stocked with fish fry, but the cooperative only had 15 yuan left, making it difficult to arrange anything, which seriously affected the progress of spring plowing.

　　Currently, spring plowing is imminent, but many grassroots cadres are pessimistic, believing that "even a clever housewife can't cook without rice," and "asking members to invest is like trying to squeeze oil from sesame seeds, a waste of effort." They are looking upward, all wanting to rely on state loans to solve the problem. In response to this situation, Party committees at all levels have been conducting education among the broad masses of farmers on hard work, self-reliance, and good production. At an enlarged meeting of county Party committee cadres in Jiangyin County, through accounting and comparative education, it was explained that self-reliance in overcoming difficulties can both reduce costs and increase income. For example, the Xiqi No. 11 Cooperative in the county did not borrow a single penny from the state last year, and all the production funds used were solved by the members themselves. At the final distribution, each labor day received 1.29 yuan, ensuring that 90% of the members increased their income, and also stored more than 8,000 yuan of production funds for this year's spring plowing. However, the No. 4 Cooperative in the same township used a total of 7,200 yuan for production funds last year, of which 4,100 yuan were loans, and as a result, the remuneration for each labor day was only 82 cents. Now, Jiangyin County has universally launched a movement for "three self-sufficiencies" in funds, fertilizers, and feed.

　　Do agricultural cooperatives have the strength to solve the difficulty of insufficient funds? The following facts answer this question. In Hainan Township, Xinghua County, the branch meeting passed a resolution to find seven ways to increase sources of funds by selling duck eggs, selling large pigs, finding eels, making reed mats, and selling scrap copper and iron, which can accumulate more than 60,000 yuan in total; at the same time, the 4,800 chickens and ducks raised by the members can solve the members' pocket money. Xinmin Cooperative in Zhenze County calculated detailed accounts at the members' representative assembly, proving that the cooperative has great potential for funds, and the members still have 11,000 yuan in their hands. After the accounting, everyone said: "If the cooperative truly lets us be the masters, then we must act as masters," and the members voluntarily invested in the cooperative. Now, Xinmin Cooperative has raised more than 8,000 yuan of production funds, which not only solved the difficulty of insufficient funds in the cooperative but also arranged the lives of 146 households in difficulty in the cooperative, which has powerfully promoted the current spring plowing production.

　　While mobilizing members to invest, it is necessary to earnestly implement the policy of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and save all funds that can be saved. The Liliang Cooperative in Kunshan County originally planned to spend 7,000 yuan before the spring harvest, but after careful calculation, only 500 yuan was needed. Xinmin Cooperative in Zhenze County rationally matched farm tools, repaired old ones instead of buying new ones, and bought four fewer sprayers and nine fewer new boats, saving 3,060 yuan, which the members were very satisfied with.

### 农业社资金不足的问题怎样解决？　江苏各级党委发动社员自力更生克服困难

    农业社资金不足的问题怎样解决？
　　江苏各级党委发动社员自力更生克服困难
    本报讯　江苏省各级党委最近提出了“自力更生，克服困难”的号召，要求各地农业社发动社员向社投资，解决当前生产资金不足的困难。
    去年是农业合作化的第一年，许多农业社的公共积累少，家底薄。在年终分配的时候，有些地区又片面地强调了“少扣多分”；有些农业社超支户多，一时又退不出来；有些社为了大力开展副业生产，增加了副业投资；因此，农业社缺乏资金的情况较为普遍。启东县四百五十一个社只有二百八十五个社有部分资金，其余都是“赤手空拳”。震泽县新民社有七百六十二亩田急需追肥，三万亩桑地急需购买桑苗，十三个鱼池要下鱼秧，但社里只剩了十五元资金，一切都不好安排，严重地影响了备耕工作的进行。
    目前，春耕在即，可是不少基层干部情绪消极，认为“巧媳妇难作无米之炊”，“要社员投资是瘪芝麻榨油白费劲”，他们眼睛向上，都想依靠国家贷款来解决。各级党委针对这种情况，对广大农民进行了艰苦奋斗，自力更生，搞好生产的教育。江阴县在县委干部扩大会议上，通过算账、对比教育，说明自力更生克服困难，既可以降低成本，又可以增加收入。如该县西岐十一社去年没有向国家贷一个钱，所用的生产资金全部是社员自己解决的，决分时每个劳动日得到一元二角九分，保证了90％的社员增加了收入，还为今年春耕生产储备了八千余元生产资金。而该乡四社，去年生产资金共用七千二百元，其中贷款四千一百元，结果每个劳动日的报酬只有八角二分。现在江阴县已经普遍开展了资金、肥料、饲料“三自给”运动。
    农业社是不是有力量解决资金不足的困难呢？下面的事实回答了这个问题。兴化县海南乡在支部大会上通过排家底，找出了卖鸭蛋、卖大猪、寻鳝鱼，做芦席，出卖废铜废铁等七种增加资金来源的方法，共可积累资金六万多元；同时，社员养的四千八百只鸡鸭，可以解决社员的零用钱。震泽县新民社在社员代表大会上算了细账，证明了社内资金潜力很大，社员手里还有一万一千元。算账后大家都说：“社里真把主我们做，我们就得做主人”，社员都自愿地向社投资。现在新民社已经筹集了生产资金八千多元，不仅解决了社内资金不足的困难，还安排了社内一百四十六户困难户的生活，有力地推动了当前的春耕生产。
    在发动社员投资的同时，必须切实贯彻勤俭办社的方针，节约一切可以节约的资金。昆山县力量社原来计划在春熟上场前开支七千元，经过精打细算以后，只需五百元。震泽县新民社合理搭配农具，修旧代新，少买四架喷雾器、九条新船，节省开支三千零六十元，社员非常满意。　（陈立人）
