    Gong Baoren
    By Our Correspondent Liu Heng
    (I)
    In the spring of 1956, the Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction Engineering Company was preparing to establish a branch in Baotou. Gong Baoren, a sixty-nine-year-old engineer, came to the Baotou industrial base with the young people.

    His wife, only one year younger than him, insisted on following her husband to Baotou, no matter how difficult life would be. The old lady was very concerned about her husband. As soon as the weather turned cold, she started worrying: "I think that old cotton coat of yours, which you've worn for two years and padded three times, can't be worn anymore! If you keep wearing it, your old bones will be crushed. I need to make you a silk-padded jacket so you can walk lightly."

    Gong Baoren quickly stopped her, saying, "I don't want it! I don't want it! Mr. Zhan said: 'An engineer's face should be like Zhang Fei's son, dark and rugged. An engineer's hands should be constantly grabbing and feeling the ground.' We can't wear good clothes!"

    Gong Baoren was a student of the famous railway engineer Zhan Tianyou. He had spent thirty or forty years building railways from south to north. After the liberation of the whole country, the leaders saw that he was old and didn't want him to run around the mountains and fields building railways, so they just had him sit in the office and lead the construction of buildings. Gong Baoren felt older and older as he sat in the office. However, when he heard that Baotou was going to build a dense railway network and that there was a shortage of experienced engineers, he suddenly realized that he wasn't old at all and that he still had a lot of energy to give.

    (II)
    One summer morning, Gong Baoren went to the construction site. After walking about half a mile, a jeep suddenly "whooshed" up from behind and stopped right in front of him. The driver, Lao Gao, opened the car door and jumped out with a smile, saying, "Teacher Gong, get in the car! If someone hadn't tipped us off, you would have slipped away again!"

    "Heh, heh, 'Old people have strong bones, the more they walk, the more energetic they become.' Actually, these legs of mine are used to running, walking is nothing." Gong Baoren said as he got into the car with Lao Gao.

    "Teacher Gong, you say walking is nothing. You don't know how many times we've been criticized because you sneak off like this! Manager Sun is always blaming our motorcade: 'Teacher Gong is an impatient person, if your cars weren't so slow, he would definitely take a car!' Heavens, we've been wronged!"

    "It's not your fault! How can it be your fault? I'll go and talk to Manager Sun."

    The car drove to the edge of the Kundulun River. Yesterday, it was just a dry riverbed, but today it was flooded with water. Lao Gao stopped the car and jumped out. Gong Baoren followed him to the riverbank.

    Lao Gao assessed the water level and said to Gong Baoren, "The car can't cross, we have to take a detour. There's a new bridge built to the south."

    "No need! The water isn't deep, the car can't cross, but people can wade across. I used to roll up my pants and cross rivers often when I was building railways in Jiangsu."

    "How old were you then?"

    "Thirty-something."

    "That's the point! That was when you were thirty-something. But now, aren't you almost seventy?"

    "What's the big deal about being almost seventy? You figure it out, how much money does it cost for a car to make a trip? And how much more gasoline does it take to make a detour? Besides, I have important things to do, I can't delay!" Gong Baoren said as he untied his shoelaces and took off his shoes.

    Lao Gao stood beside him, anxious. Just then, a comrade Bai was preparing to wade across the river, so he carried Gong Baoren across on his back.

    (III)
    Gong Baoren was in a hurry to cross the river because he really had important things to do. He found a technician and discussed a construction blueprint with him.

    "Why are we building three large bridges on such a short section of railway?"

    "The Baotou area has a lot of wind and flash floods, so we should be cautious."

    "What's the water flow here?"

    "I don't know, it's not written in the design documents."

    "If it's not written in the design documents, then we have to find the data ourselves! How can we decide to build three large bridges without knowing the water flow?"

    The technician blushed and didn't say anything. Gong Baoren thought for a moment and then said, "Once the railway is built, it will be used for generations, so we can't be careless at all. If we build too few bridges or build them too small, there will be a major accident when the water rises in the future. If we build too many bridges or build them too big, it will certainly be safe, but wouldn't the state's precious funds be wasted for nothing? Therefore, we must build the bridges just right, neither too many nor too few, neither too big nor too small, based on a lot of data. Of course, our railway team has just arrived and doesn't understand the situation in this area. That's okay! Wherever we go, we must consult the local folks."

    Gong Baoren left the technician and went into a village, where he found a fifty-five-year-old Yang and they began to talk.

    "Is the water here high?"

    "Not high, even a sudden flood for an hour wouldn't rise more than two feet."

    "How many times a year does the water rise?"

    "Not many, at most seven or eight times. Even with torrential rain, it will stop in an hour or two. Usually, small rains seep into the ground because it's sandy soil."

    Gong Baoren asked Yang to lead the way and walked along the canals all the way to the foot of the Wula Mountains.

    The next day, Gong Baoren ran to the village again and, through Yang, found a sixty-three-year-old Han (who had lived in the village for more than fifty years). The three old men followed several canals, looking and talking along the way. Gong Baoren learned a lot of information and, when he returned home, he wrote a report overnight, suggesting that the three large bridges be reduced to one.

    The Central Design Institute specially sent Engineer Xing to Baotou to study this suggestion. After many days of heated debate and many on-site investigations, the suggestion was finally approved.

    In the evening, Gong Baoren couldn't sit still in his dormitory. The problem wasn't just how much money this suggestion could save the country, but through this suggestion, he saw that he wasn't old and could still contribute to the country. It happened to be Saturday, so he walked out of his room, crossed several sandy roads, and went to the club.

    (IV)
    Gong Baoren's wife woke up and suddenly found the house very bright. It turned out the light was on, and Gong Baoren was hunched over the table writing something. The old lady was both anxious and angry:

    "What are you writing? Why aren't you asleep yet? I think the older you get, the more energetic you become? You run around outside during the day, and you write in the house at night. Wasn't your precious suggestion already approved? What new invention or creation are you writing?"

    The next morning, Gong Baoren was still asleep. The old lady quietly put on her clothes and got out of bed, gently opened the drawer, rummaged through it a few times, and found two pieces of paper filled with writing. One paper had an old poem, titled "Old Age Stealing Time to Learn from Youth": "On a fine day, entering the dance floor with great interest, the rhythm of the music is like mercury. Swaying like Feng Fu, legs and feet come to life, a pear blossom tree protects the sea crabapple…"

    The other paper was an application to join the Party.

    After reading the poem and the application, the old lady couldn't control herself anymore. Knowing that her husband hadn't woken up yet, she laughed to herself:

    "I knew it, what secrets could you possibly have that you could hide from me? I think you are simply an old peony, seventy years old, and you still want to bloom!" (Attached picture)

   本报记者  刘衡	（一）
    1956年春天，鞍山冶金化学建筑工程公司准备在包头成立分公司。六十九岁的工程师龚宝仁跟年轻人一块来到了包头工业基地。
    他那个比他只小一岁的老伴，也说不管生活有多苦，一定要跟着丈夫到包头来。老婆婆很心疼丈夫。天刚冷，她就叨咕开了：“我看，你那身穿了两年、加了三回棉花的旧棉衣，不能再穿下去啦！再穿，你的老骨头都要压碎啦。得做件丝棉袄，走路一身轻。”
    龚宝仁听了，赶忙挡住：“我不要！我不要！詹先生说过：‘工程师的脸要像张飞的儿子，是黑黑的。工程师的手，要经常满地抓个不停。’咱们不能穿好衣服！”
    龚宝仁是著名铁路工程师詹天佑的学生。他从南到北地修铁路有三、四十年的时间。全国解放以后，领导方面看他岁数大，不让他满山遍野跑着修铁路，光让他坐在办公室里领导盖房子。龚宝仁在办公室里，越坐越觉得自己年纪大了。可是，当他一听说包头要建筑密密的铁路网，缺少有经验的工程师，他忽然发现，自己并没有老，自己身上有许多力气还没有全部拿出来呢。	（二）
    一个夏天的早晨，龚宝仁到工地去。才走了一里路，突然一辆吉普车从后边“嗤溜”赶上来，刚好停在他的前面。司机老高打开车门，笑嘻嘻地跳下来说：“龚老师，上车吧！要不是有人给我们通风报信，又被您溜走啦！”
   “咳，咳，‘人老骨头硬，越走越有劲’，其实，我这是跑惯路的腿啦，走走没有什么。”龚宝仁一边说，一边跟着老高上了车子。
   “龚老师，您说您走走没有什么。您不晓得您这么偷偷一走，害得我们挨了多少次批评！孙经理老怪我们汽车队：‘龚老师是个急性人，要不是你们出车太慢，他准会坐车走！’天哪，真把我们冤枉死啦！”
   “这不怪你们！这怎么能怪你们？我要去给孙经理说说。”
    车子开到了昆独仑河边。昨天这里还是一条干巴巴的河沟，没想到今天已经涨了汪汪一片大水。老高刹住车，跳下来，龚宝仁跟着他走到河边。
    老高打量了一下水势，对龚宝仁说：“车子过不去啦，得弯路走。南边新建了一座大桥。”
   “不用啦！水并不深，车子走不了，人可以淌过去。以前我在江苏修铁路，经常卷起裤腿过河。”
   “那会儿您有多大？”
   “三十多岁。”
   “这不就得啦！那会儿是三十 多岁。可是这会儿，您不是快七十了吗？”
   “快七十了又有什么要紧？你算一算，汽车跑一趟，要花好些钱？再一弯路，又要多花多少汽油？加上我身上有要紧事，不能耽搁！”龚宝仁说着就解鞋带，脱鞋子。
    老高站在旁边，急得不行。正好有位白同志准备淌水过河，就把龚宝仁背了过去。	（三）
      龚宝仁急着过河，的确是有要紧事。他找到一位技术员，跟他研究一张施工图纸。
   “这么短的一段铁路，为什么要修三座大桥？”
   “包头地区风多山洪大呀，应该慎重一点。”
   “这儿水的流量有多大？”
   “不知道，设计资料上没有写。”
   “设计资料上没有写，就得我们自己多方面去找资料呀！不知道水的流量，怎么能决定要修三座大桥呢？”
    技术员脸红了，没有做声。龚宝仁想了想，又说：“铁路修好了，是要用好几辈子的，一点也马虎不得。要是桥修少了，修小了，将来一涨水，就是大事故。要是桥修多了，修大了，固然保险，可是国家的宝贵资金不是白白地给浪费了吗？因此，咱们一定要根据许多资料，尽量把桥修得不多不少，不大不小，刚刚合适。当然啰，咱们铁道队刚刚来，对这个地区情况不了解。那不要紧！咱们走到哪里，就要向当地老乡请教。”
    龚宝仁离开技术员，走进一个村子，找到一位五十五岁的杨老汉，他们就攀谈起来。
   “这里的水大不大呀？”
   “不大，一个时辰的急水，也泛不起两尺高呀。”
   “一年有多少次水呀？”
   “不多，顶多七次八次。就是有瓢泼的大雨，一两个时辰就下去啦。一般的小雨，因为是砂子地，都渗进地里了。”
    龚宝仁让杨老汉领路，沿着河渠一直走到乌拉山脚下。
    第二天，龚宝仁又跑到村子里，通过杨老汉找到一位六十三岁的韩老汉（他在村子里住了五十多年）。三位老人顺着几条河渠，一路看，一路谈。龚宝仁了解到很多情况，回到家，连夜赶写了一份报告，建议把三座大桥减成一座。
    中央设计院特地派邢工程师到包头来研究这个建议。经过好多天激烈争辩，好多次实地勘查，建议终于被批准了。
    晚上，龚宝仁在宿舍里怎么也坐不住了。问题还不仅仅在于这个建议能为国家节省多少钱，而是通过这个建议，他看出自己并不算老，还能为国家贡献一份力量。这天刚好是星期六，他走出房门，穿过几条沙子路，到俱乐部去了。	（四）
    龚宝仁的老伴睡醒一觉，忽然发现房子里很亮。原来电灯开着，龚宝仁正伏在桌子上写什么东西。老婆婆又急又气：
   “你在写什么？怎么还不睡？我看你呀，怎么越老精神越大？白天在外边跑，晚上又在屋里写。你写的宝贝建议不是已经被批准了吗？你又在写什么新发明，新创造？”
    第二天清早，龚宝仁还睡着没醒，老婆婆轻轻地穿衣下床，轻轻地拉开抽屉，翻了几翻，翻出两张写满字的稿纸。一张纸写的是一首旧诗，题目叫“老年偷闲学少年”：“佳日乘兴入舞场，节奏音乐水银光。婆娑冯妇腿脚生，梨花一树护海棠。……”
    另外一张，是入党申请书。
    老婆婆看完了诗，看完了申请书，再也管不住自己的嘴巴了。明明知道丈夫还没有睡醒，她一个人笑着说开了：
   “我说么，你还会有什么秘密，瞒得过我？我看你呀，简直是棵老牡丹，七十岁啦，还要开花！”（附图片）
