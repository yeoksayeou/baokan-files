    Xinhua News Agency, March 18th, Cairo News: Egyptian President Nasser stated on the 17th that Egypt will continue to prohibit Israeli ships from passing through the Suez Canal.
    When meeting with Gapugla, the editor-in-chief of the Paris "Sunday Morning News," he said, "All ships paying tolls to Egypt and belonging to countries at peace with us will pass through without difficulty."
    Since 1949, Egypt has maintained a technical state of war with Israel. Egypt has previously announced that it is based on this situation, for self-defense, that it prohibits Israeli ships from passing through the Suez Canal.
    Nasser also told Gapugla that the five-month blockage of the canal was caused by Britain and France. If Britain and France admit that their military aggression against Egypt was wrong, then he is willing to extend his hand. He said that although Egypt can withstand a long-term economic blockade, he is "prepared to reach sincere agreements within the scope of law and justice."
    Xinhua News Agency, March 18th, New York News: The Israeli representative to the United Nations confirmed on the 16th that Israel has received "new guarantees" from the United States in recent days, and the task of Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir's recent trip to Washington was to understand how the United States would realize its "guarantees."
    These representatives revealed that the guarantees re-proposed by the United States to Israel are: the United States does not recognize any obstacles to the free navigation of American merchant ships in the Gulf of Aqaba; on the Gaza Strip issue, the United States recognizes Egypt's legal status on the one hand, but at the same time supports the continued stationing of United Nations forces in Gaza until the future of Gaza is determined.

    纳赛尔总统表示
    仍将禁止以色列船只通过运河
    美国又给以色列新的保证企图侵犯埃及主权
    新华社18日讯　开罗消息：埃及总统纳赛尔在17日表示，埃及将继续禁止以色列船只通过苏伊士运河。
    他在接见巴黎“星期日晨报”主编加普格拉的时候说，“向埃及缴纳通行税以及属于同我们处于和平状态中的国家的一切船只都将毫无困难地通过”。
    从1949年以来，埃及一直同以色列保持着技术上的战争状态。埃及过去曾经宣布，埃及就是根据这种情况，为了自卫，禁止以色列船只通过苏伊士运河。
    纳赛尔还对加普格拉说，运河阻塞五个月是由英法造成的。如果英法承认它们对埃及进行军事侵略是错误的，那末他愿意伸出他的手来。他说，虽然埃及经得起长期的经济封锁，但是他“准备在法律和正义的范围内达成有诚意的协议”。
    据新华社18日讯　纽约消息：以色列驻联合国代表16日证实，以色列在这几天里已经得到了美国的“新的保证”，而以色列外交部长梅厄夫人最近去华盛顿的任务就是要了解美国怎样来实现它的“保证”。
    这些代表透露，美国重新向以色列提出的保证是：美国不承认任何对美国商船在亚喀巴湾的自由通航的障碍；在加沙地区问题上，美国一方面承认埃及的法律地位，但同时又赞成联合国部队在加沙前途确定以前继续留驻加沙。
