　　Clumsy "Psychological Warfare"
    While US President Eisenhower's Middle East envoy Richards is touring the capitals of Arab countries, peddling the "Eisenhower Doctrine" everywhere, a strange "behind-the-scenes news" has been spread from Washington: It is said that the US suddenly cancelled its aid to Egypt's Aswan Dam project last year in order to embarrass the Soviet Union, not Egypt.
    The disseminator of this news is Jackson, former psychological warfare adviser to President Eisenhower. This Cold War expert said with great seriousness: "For a long time, the United States has been looking for opportunities to puncture the Soviet Union's bragging. The method is to refuse to give economic assistance to a country when it asks for it, thereby forcing the country to ask the Soviets to fulfill their promises, and the Aswan Dam just provided this opportunity."
    According to Mr. Jackson, the United States' cancellation of aid to Egypt's Aswan Dam project was not to exert political pressure on Egypt, or even, as the State Department said, to "doubt Egypt's ability to implement the project," but to make the Soviet Union "lose face."
    However, anyone who is not forgetful will remember that it was the United States, not the Soviet Union, that boasted about helping Egypt build the Aswan Dam. The Soviet Union is concerned about Egypt's economic development and is constantly striving to expand its economic exchanges with Egypt, but the Soviet Union has not boasted as much as the United States about providing financial assistance for the construction of the Aswan Dam. Therefore, the United States' cancellation of aid to Egypt can only puncture its own bragging, not someone else's.
    Jackson's dissemination of such "behind-the-scenes news" at this time is extremely obvious. He wants to defend and whitewash the rogue behavior of the United States that once angered the Arab countries. Everyone knows that Washington is now trying its best to please the Arab countries and induce them to accept the "Eisenhower Doctrine." So this former psychological warfare adviser to the US President came to use his psychological warfare tactics. However, he doesn't understand the psychology of the Arab people too much. The Arab people have been deceived by the United States, and it is not so easy to deceive them again. Moreover, the ghost story fabricated by Jackson is so clumsy. (Ya)

### 拙劣的“心理战术”

　　拙劣的“心理战术”
    当美国总统的中东特使理查兹正在周游阿拉伯各国首都，到处兜售“艾森豪威尔主义”的时候，从华盛顿传出了一项奇特的
  “幕后新闻”：据说去年美国突然撤销对埃及阿斯旺水坝工程的援助，目的是为了要同苏联而不是同埃及为难。
    散播这个消息的是艾森豪威尔总统的前心理战术顾问杰克逊。这位冷战专家煞有介事地说：“长期以来，美国一直在寻找机会戳破俄国的牛皮。办法是在一个国家要求给予经济援助时拒绝给它经济援助，从而迫使这个国家要求苏联人实现他们的诺言，而阿斯旺水坝正好提供了这种机会。”
    按照杰克逊先生的说法，美国撤销对埃及阿斯旺水坝工程的援助，并不是在政治上对埃及施加压力，甚至也不是像国务院所说的，“怀疑埃及有能力实现这项计划”，而是为了要让苏联“丢脸”。
    但是，任何并非健忘的人都会记得，在援助埃及修建阿斯旺水坝这件事情上吹过牛皮的是美国而不是苏联。苏联关心埃及的经济发展，并且不断努力扩大同埃及的经济交流关系，但是苏联却没有像美国那样大吹大擂的说要对阿斯旺水坝的建设工程提供财政援助。因此美国撤销对埃及援助的做法，也就只能戳破它自己的而不是别人的牛皮。
    杰克逊在这个时候散播这样的“幕后新闻”，其目的是异常明显的。他是想要给美国那一次曾经激怒了阿拉伯国家的无赖行为进行辩护和洗刷。谁都知道，华盛顿现在正要用尽力气来讨好阿拉伯各国，诱使它们接受“艾森豪威尔主义”。于是这位美国总统的前心理战术顾问就来施展他的心理战术了。不过他未免太不了解阿拉伯各国人民的心理。阿拉伯各国人民已经受过美国的欺骗，再要他们受骗就不是这样容易的事情。何况杰克逊所编造的这种鬼话又是如此的笨拙。　（亚）
