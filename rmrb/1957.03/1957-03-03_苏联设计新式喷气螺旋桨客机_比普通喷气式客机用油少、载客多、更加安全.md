    Soviet Union Designs New Turboprop Airliner
    Uses Less Fuel, Carries More Passengers, and is Safer Than Ordinary Jet Airliners

    Moscow Dispatch, March 1st. The famous Soviet aircraft designer, Antonov, said in an interview with a "Red Star" reporter: Soviet aircraft designers are effectively designing and manufacturing several new types of turboprop airliners with four engines, and their performance will be much better than similar foreign aircraft.

    The turboprop airliner designed by Antonov, named "Ukraine," will soon be flying over the Soviet Union. The difference between this aircraft and the "Tu-104" jet airliner is that smaller jet engines are installed on both sides of the fuselage as supplementary propulsion. In addition, four propeller engines are installed at the front of the wings. The advantages of this aircraft over ordinary jet airliners are: it uses less fuel, accommodates more passengers, and does not require specialized concrete runways for takeoff and landing. The manufacturing cost is also lower. This aircraft can accommodate seventy to eighty passengers ("Tu-104" only accommodates fifty passengers), with a flying speed of six hundred kilometers per hour ("Tu-104" is eight hundred kilometers per hour). Special attention has been paid to flight safety in the design of this aircraft. In the event of an engine failure during flight, it can continue to fly safely with only two engines. Many new aviation technology equipment have been added to the aircraft, which can take off and land safely day and night and under any weather conditions. This aircraft can take off and land at ordinary airports. The cabin is equipped with hot and cold air conditioners to ensure that passengers breathe normally and comfortably when the aircraft is flying at high altitudes (flying altitude can reach eight thousand to ten thousand meters).

    Antonov also said: The aircraft design bureau headed by Comrade Tupolev, academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and designer of the "Tu-104" aircraft, is also successfully designing another larger turboprop airliner with four engines. This aircraft can accommodate one hundred and eighty passengers. The famous Soviet aircraft designer Ilyushin is also participating in the design of this aircraft.

    苏联设计新式喷气螺旋桨客机
    比普通喷气式客机用油少、载客多、更加安全
    本报莫斯科1日电  苏联著名的飞机设计师安东诺夫在和“红星报”记者谈话时说：苏联飞机设计师们正在有成效地设计和制造几种新型的喷气式又带四引擎螺旋桨的客机，它们的性能要比外国同类的飞机优越得多。
    安东诺夫设计的被命名为“乌克兰”的喷气螺旋桨客机不久就将飞翔在苏联上空。这种飞机和“图—104”喷气式客机不同之处是：在机身左右两面装有较小型的喷气发动机，作为补充推进力。另外，在机翼前端装有四个螺旋桨发动机。这种飞机比一般喷气式客机的长处是：用油省、乘客容纳得多、起飞和降落不需要专门的混凝土跑道。制造成本也低。这种飞机可容纳七十到八十个乘客（“图—104”只容纳五十个乘客），每小时的飞行速度为六百公里（“图—104”是八百公里），这种飞机在设计中特别注意了飞行安全。在飞行中偶尔遭遇引擎发生故障时，它只用两个发动机也可继续安全飞行。飞机上新增加了很多航空技术新设备，白天、夜间和任何气候条件下都能安全起飞、安全降落。这种飞机可以在普通机场起飞和降落。机舱内装有冷热空气调节器，保证飞机在高空飞行时（飞行高度可达八千到一万公尺），乘客呼吸正常、舒服。
    安东诺夫又说：以“图—104”式飞机设计者、苏联科学院院士图波列夫同志为首的飞机设计局正在顺利地设计着另一种更大的喷气式带四引擎螺旋桨客机。这种飞机可容一百八十个乘客。参加这种飞机设计的还有苏联著名飞机设计师伊留欣。
