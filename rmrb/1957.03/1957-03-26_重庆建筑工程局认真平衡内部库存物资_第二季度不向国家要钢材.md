Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd. The Chongqing Construction Engineering Bureau has decided not to request a single ton of steel from the state, and will still complete the 160,000 square meters of construction tasks for the second quarter of this year. The 650 tons of steel required by the bureau in the second quarter will be entirely resolved through internal balancing of inventory materials.

Currently, the Chongqing Construction Engineering Bureau has over 700 tons of steel in stock, which, in addition to meeting its own needs for the second quarter, can also partially support units such as the Sichuan Provincial Department of Industry.

This steel was accumulated last year. Last year, due to the tight supply of steel, the requested steel could not be allocated in full according to the quarterly plan. As a result, the Construction Engineering Bureau changed over 90,000 square meters of mixed-structure buildings to brick-wood structure buildings. At the same time, construction units, in order to strive for an early start, also found ways to apply for steel themselves, resulting in the accumulation of several hundred tons of steel.

This year, in order to create conditions for the start of new projects, the Chongqing Construction Engineering Bureau, from the beginning of this month, organized forces to go deep into the work areas and companies to assess tasks, inventory, and the progress of engineering projects, and carried out balancing level by level according to the progress of engineering projects, thereby grasping the actual engineering materials needed in the second quarter.

The Chongqing Construction Engineering Bureau's good performance in balancing internal inventory materials is inseparable from the strengthening of materials management work at normal times. At present, all construction sites under the bureau generally implement the quota-based material requisition system, and the accounts and materials are basically consistent. At the construction sites, whether it is steel, hardware, or river sand, pebbles, and bamboo baskets, everything is neatly stacked. At the same time, because of the strengthening of balancing and scheduling, the material inventory at construction sites has also decreased from 15 to 20 days last year to the current 3 days.

### 重庆建筑工程局认真平衡内部库存物资　第二季度不向国家要钢材

　　重庆建筑工程局认真平衡内部库存物资
　　第二季度不向国家要钢材
    新华社重庆22日电　重庆建筑工程管理局决定不向国家要一吨钢材，同样完成今年第二季度十六万平方公尺的建筑任务。这个局在今年第二季所需要的六百五十吨钢材，全部从库存物资的内部平衡中得到解决。
    目前重庆建筑工程管理局的库存钢材有七百多吨，除了满足第二季度本身需要以外，还能部分地支援四川省工业厅等单位。
    这些钢材是去年积存下来的。去年因为钢材供应紧张，申请的钢材不能按季度如数下拨，建筑工程管理局便把九万多平方公尺的混合结构建筑改为砖木结构建筑；同时，建设单位为了争取早日开工，也自行设法申请钢材，因此几百吨钢材便积存下来。
    今年重庆建筑工程管理局为了替新工程创造开工条件，从本月初起即组织力量深入工区、公司，摸任务、摸库存、摸工程项目的进度，并且按工程项目的进度逐级进行平衡，从而掌握了第二季度实际需要的工程材料。
    重庆建筑工程管理局平衡内部库存材料做得好，同平时加强材料管理工作分不开。现在管理局所属各工地一般都贯彻执行了限额领料制度，账料基本相符。在工地上，不论钢材、五金还是河沙、卵石和箩筐，都做到堆码整齐；同时，因为加强了平衡和调度，工地材料库存量也由去年的十五天到二十天，下降到现在的三天。
