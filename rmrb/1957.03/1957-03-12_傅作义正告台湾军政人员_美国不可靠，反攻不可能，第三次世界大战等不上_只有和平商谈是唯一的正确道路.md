Fu Zuoyi Admonishes Taiwan Military and Political Personnel
The United States is Unreliable, Counter-Attack is Impossible, A Third World War Cannot Be Waited For
Only Peaceful Negotiation is the Only Correct Path
    Premier Zhou recently visited eleven countries in Asia and Europe. Thanks to the achievements of our national construction, the support of 600 million people, and Premier Zhou's warm, kind, frank, sincere, correct and appropriate application of our country's peaceful diplomatic policy, our friendship with these countries has been greatly enhanced, the unity of socialist countries has been strengthened, and the strength of the peace camp has been expanded. This has allowed our 5,000-year-old country to shine brightly on the international stage. This achievement is very significant.
    In the Premier's report, he made incisive analyses of the international situation and the Taiwan issue. The Premier pointed out that the United States' policy is to pursue tension that is not excessively tense, and to be forced into relaxation that it does not dare to maintain for long. The Premier pointed out that the reason why Sino-US relations have not been improved for a long time is that the United States uses the Taiwan issue as a link in creating tension in the Far East. However, our determination to safeguard national sovereignty and liberate Taiwan is unshakable. The general trend of Taiwan's return to the motherland is unstoppable. There is no force in the world that can permanently separate Chinese from Chinese.
    After the People's Government put forward the call to strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, I spoke to the military and political personnel in Taiwan at the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC last year, hoping that they would make up their minds as soon as possible and return to the embrace of the motherland. Since then, due to various changes in the situation, more and more KMT military and political personnel in Taiwan have responded to the call of the People's Government and are willing to promote peaceful liberation, and the possibility of peaceful liberation of Taiwan has become greater and greater. However, in order to undermine the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue, American imperialism has taken many despicable measures. On the one hand, it strengthened its control over Taiwan, and at the same time launched a pro-American and anti-Chiang movement. Some senior American officials are also spreading rumors that are unfavorable to the Taiwan authorities everywhere. The military and political personnel in Taiwan should further understand from these situations whether the United States' occupation of Taiwan is to support your wishes, or for its own strategic purposes? Does it love the land of Taiwan, or does it love you? In this situation, what will your future be like? These questions are worth your deep consideration.
    I used to hold military and political positions in the Kuomintang government. After the peaceful liberation of Beiping, you cursed me as a traitor, but I think I can still be regarded as your candid friend. Because, I used to work with you, and I have a lot of understanding of your thoughts and feelings. In the past few years, I have worked in the People's Government, and I have a deep observation and a cordial feeling about the situation in New China, so I am willing to talk to you a few words. This is on the one hand starting from the interests of the motherland, and at the same time it is precisely for your future. What I want to say can be summarized into a few words, that is: The United States is unreliable, counter-attack is impossible, a third world war cannot be waited for, and only peaceful negotiation is the only correct path.

    (I)
    Why do I say that the United States is unreliable? Because the United States has always supported you on the one hand, and undermined you on the other. On the one hand, it uses you as its tool, and on the other hand, it does not trust you. At the same time, it supports several forces, ready to get rid of one and replace it with another at any time. Senior Kuomintang officials will have a deep understanding of these lessons, and countless examples can be cited. For example, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it supported the Kuomintang government on the one hand, and established the so-called "third force" on the other hand. At the same time, some senators and representatives of the United States, soldiers, delegations, journalists, etc., spread the news that the Kuomintang was corrupt, incompetent, and muddle-headed. After the Kuomintang government arrived in Taiwan, the United States still nominally supported this government, but within this government, it secretly arranged many pro-American factions who directly colluded with the United States; at the same time, Japan, which was controlled by the United States, also sheltered the traitor Liao Wenyi to engage in the so-called "Taiwan Independent Republic." Recently, it launched the so-called "free elements" to carry out a pro-American and anti-Chiang movement. These examples can illustrate that what the United States wants is the land of Taiwan, and it has no love for you; what the United States wants is an obedient tool, and it does not ask whether it is Zhang, Wang, Li, or Zhao. When it doesn't need it, it kicks it away without any regret.

    (II)
    Recently, Taiwan has released information that it wants to counter-attack the mainland. In my opinion, the Kuomintang government in Taiwan cannot decide this issue, but depends on the needs of the United States. If the United States needs it, the Kuomintang will have to fight even if it doesn't want to. If the United States doesn't need it, the Kuomintang can't fight even if it wants to. Even if it can carry out the so-called "counter-attack", failure is doomed. Because, under the leadership of the Communist Party, our country has grown rapidly in strength in the past eight years, and its internal consolidation and unity. These situations are not easy for people in Taiwan to understand. Our country's situation has had major developments this year. That is to say, we have successfully completed the great historical task of socialist transformation. 500 million farmers across the country have joined agricultural production cooperatives, and the vast majority of capitalist industry and commerce have implemented joint state-private ownership. These great changes, on the surface, are realized through vigorous movements, but in reality, they have undergone long-term meticulous preparation, persuasion and education, and used successful examples to set an example, win the trust of the people, and then succeed like a ripe melon falling from its stem, or water flowing into a channel. Therefore, the speed and stability of these changes in our country are unprecedented in the history of the world. If in the past few years there were still a few people who had some concerns about socialist transformation, then now the people across the country have "passed the test", and the people across the country have voluntarily, happily and easily entered socialism. This is just like a person who has always suffered bitterness, once he tastes sweet water, he will never want to drink bitter water again. The people of the whole country more heartily love and support the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and are proud to have such leadership. Therefore, if the Taiwan Kuomintang government launches the so-called "counter-attack", it will not be like what you imagine, "a mass response", but will encounter painful annihilation everywhere. Therefore, the sooner you launch a "counter-attack", the faster you will be eliminated.

    (III)
    You want to wait for the Third World War, but you won't be able to wait. Because the essence of socialist countries is that they need peace and oppose war, and they will never launch a war. Now the forces of the peace and democracy camp and the peace-loving people all over the world have grown strong enough to effectively maintain world peace and frustrate any provocations by war-mongers. Especially when several major countries have mastered destructive weapons such as atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and missiles, whoever launches a war is tantamount to self-destruction, and even Eisenhower has to admit this. Some time ago, Britain, France and Israel launched a war of aggression against Egypt. With the heroic resistance of the Egyptian people and the support of the world's peaceful forces, the war was quickly stopped, and the aggressors suffered a shameful defeat. This is a clear example. Therefore, your fantasy of waiting for the Third World War to break out and using the power of imperialism to fight back to the mainland is bound to fail.

    (IV)
    Based on the above analysis, the United States is unreliable, counter-attack is impossible, and the Third World War cannot be waited for. If you are not reconciled to dying in Taiwan and are willing to return to the mainland, it is forever impossible to fight back, but peaceful negotiation will be welcomed by the people of the whole country. Many of the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan once followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen and did work that was beneficial to the revolution, many participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and many people have national self-esteem and patriotism. Now the United States is conspiring to create "two Chinas" in an attempt to turn Taiwan into an American territory like Honolulu. You oppose this American conspiracy, and we also oppose it, which is intolerable to any Chinese. We all oppose the American conspiracy to create "two Chinas". No Chinese is willing to see his complete motherland suffer division. As long as we Chinese ourselves do not want to separate, no one can separate us. Because we are all Chinese, and we all have patriotism. Although we have many different opinions on politics, this is our country's internal affairs, and it is a matter for the Chinese themselves. Everything can be resolved through peaceful negotiation. I know that you are all unwilling to live in a corner of Taiwan, and to be despised and manipulated by the United States, and are willing to return to the mainland. Since it is impossible to fight back, then only peaceful negotiation is the only correct path.
    In recent years, our motherland has gained a very high prestige in the world. If through your efforts, the Taiwan issue can be quickly resolved peacefully, and the complete and complete reunification of the motherland can be realized, then you will have made a contribution to the people, and the motherland will be even more glorious. Now is the time for all Chinese to show their patriotism. I hope you will take action as soon as possible. (Attached picture)

    傅作义正告台湾军政人员
    美国不可靠，反攻不可能，第三次世界大战等不上
    只有和平商谈是唯一的正确道路
    周总理这次访问了亚洲和欧洲十一个国家。由于我们国家建设的成就和六亿人民的支持，以及周总理的热情亲切，坦率真诚，正确而恰当地运用了我国的和平外交政策，因而大大地增进了我们和这些国家的友谊，加强了社会主义国家的团结，扩大了和平阵营的力量。使我们五千年的古国在国际上大放光彩。这收获是非常重大的。
    在总理的报告中，对于国际形势以及台湾问题都作了精辟的分析。总理指出，美国的政策是追求紧张而又不能过分紧张，被迫和缓而又不敢长期和缓。总理指出，中美关系所以长期不能得到改善，就是因为美国利用台湾问题作为制造远东紧张局势的一环。但是，我们维护国家主权和解放台湾的决心是不可动摇的。台湾回到祖国怀抱的大势是不可阻挡的。世界上没有任何力量可以把中国人同中国人永远分割开来。
    在人民政府提出争取和平解放台湾的号召以后，我曾在去年政协第二届全国委员会第二次会议上，对台湾的军政人员说过话，希望他们早日下定决心，回到祖国的怀抱来。以后，由于各种情况的变化，在台湾的国民党军政人员响应人民政府的号召，愿意促进和平解放的人越来越多，和平解放台湾的可能性也越来越大了。但是，美帝国主义为了破坏台湾问题的和平解决，采取了很多卑鄙的措施。一方面加强对台湾的控制，同时发动拥美反蒋运动。一些美国高级官员又到处散布不利于台湾当局的流言。台湾军政人员应当从这些情况中进一步体察出，美国占领台湾是支持你们的愿望呢？还是为了它自己的战略目的？是爱台湾这块土地呢？还是有所爱于你们？在这种情况下你们的前途又将如何？这些问题都值得你们深长考虑。
    我过去在国民党政府担任过军政职务，在北平和平解放以后，你们骂我是叛逆，但我觉得我还可算作你们的诤友。因为，过去我和你们一块工作过，对你们的思想感情了解得较多，而这几年我在人民政府工作，对新中国的情况有深刻的观察，亲切的感受，所以我愿意和你们谈几句话。这一方面是从祖国的利益出发，同时也正是为你们的前途着想。我要讲的可归纳为几句话，就是：美国不可靠，反攻不可能，第三次世界大战等不上，只有和平商谈是唯一的正确道路。
    （一）
    为什么说美国不可靠呢？因为美国对国民党从来就是一面支持你，一面又垮你的台。一面利用你作为它的工具，一面又不信任你，同时扶持好几种势力，准备随时甩掉一个，换上一个。这些教训，国民党高级人员都会有深刻的体会，也可以举出无数的事例。比如，在抗日战争胜利以后，它一方面支持国民党政府，另一面又树立所谓“第三势力”，同时美国一些参众两院议员、军人、代表团、新闻记者等等，到处传播国民党贪污腐化，昏愦无能。在国民党政府到台湾以后，美国表面上仍支持这个政府，但是在这个政府内部，又暗地里布置了许多直接和美国勾结的亲美派；同时在美国控制下的日本，还卵翼着汉奸廖文毅要搞所谓“台湾独立共和国”。最近又发动所谓“自由分子”，进行拥美反蒋运动。这些事例都可说明美国所要的是台湾这块地方，并无爱于你们；美国所要的是一个听话的工具，并不问张王李赵。当它不需要时，就一脚踢开，毫不可惜。
    （二）
    最近台湾放出空气要反攻大陆。以我看来，台湾的国民党政府并不能决定这个问题，而要看美国的需要如何。如果美国需要的话，国民党不想打也得打，美国不需要的话，国民党想打也打不成。就算能够进行所谓“反攻”，那失败也是注定了的。因为，我们的国家在共产党领导下，八年来力量迅速壮大，内部巩固团结，这些情况是在台湾的人们所不容易了解的。我们国家的情况今年又有重大的发展。这就是说，我们已经顺利地完成了社会主义改造的伟大历史任务。全国五亿农民已经参加了农业生产合作社，绝大部分资本主义工商业已经实行了公私合营。这些伟大的变革，从表面上看，是通过轰轰烈烈的运动来实现的，而实际上是经过长期的细致准备，说服教育，并用成功的事例做出榜样，取得人民的信任，然后才像瓜熟蒂落、水到渠成一样得到成功的。所以，我国这些变革进行的迅速、稳健，是全世界历史上所没有的。如果说在前几年还有少数人对社会主义改造多少有些顾虑，那么，现在全国人民都已经“过关”了，全国人民都已经自愿地、愉快地、轻松地进入了社会主义。这就正如一向吃苦水的人，一旦吃到甜水，他就再不愿意吃苦水了。全国人民对于共产党和人民政府的领导，更加衷心地爱戴与拥护，并且以有这样的领导而感到自豪。因此，台湾国民党政府如果发动所谓“反攻”，不是像你们所想像的“群起响应”，而是到处遇到痛击歼灭。所以，你们发动“反攻”越早，你们被消灭的越快。
    （三）
    你们想等待第三次世界大战是等不到的。因为，社会主义国家的本质是需要和平，反对战争的，决不会发动战争。现在和平民主阵营和全世界爱好和平人民的力量，已经壮大到可以有效地保持世界和平，挫败战争贩子的任何挑衅。特别是在几个主要国家都掌握了原子弹、氢弹、导弹等毁灭性武器的情况下，谁要发动战争，就等于自取灭亡，连艾森豪威尔也不得不承认这一点。前些时英、法和以色列对埃及发动侵略战争，在埃及人民英勇抵抗、全世界和平力量的支持下，战争很快的就被制止了，侵略者遭受到可耻的失败。这就是个鲜明的例证。所以，你们想等待第三次世界大战起来，借帝国主义的力量打回大陆，这个幻想是一定要落空的。
    （四）
    根据以上的分析，美国不可靠，反攻不可能，第三次世界大战等不上。如果你们不甘心老死台湾，愿意回到大陆来，打回来是永远不可能的，而和平商谈却会受到全国人民的欢迎。在台湾的国民党军政人员有许多曾追随孙中山先生做过有益于革命的工作，有许多参加过抗日战争，有许多人是有民族自尊心和爱国心的。现在美国正在阴谋制造“两个中国”，企图把台湾变成像檀香山那样的美国属地。美国这个阴谋，你们反对，我们也反对，是任何中国人所不能容忍的。我们都反对美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋，没有一个中国人愿意看到自己完整的祖国遭受分裂，只要我们中国人自己不愿意分开，就谁也不能把我们分开。因为我们都是中国人，我们都有爱国心，尽管我们在政治上有许多不同的意见，但这是我国的内政，是中国人自己的事情，一切都可以通过和平商谈的方式求得解决。我知道你们都是不甘心屈居台湾一隅，受美国的轻侮与拨弄，而愿意回到大陆上来的。打回来既不可能，那么，就只有和平商谈是唯一正确的道路。
    这几年，我们祖国在世界上已经得到很高的威望，如果通过你们的努力，使台湾问题迅速求得和平解决，实现祖国彻底的、完全的统一，这样，你们对人民就作出了贡献，祖国也将更加光彩。现在是一切中国人表现爱国心的时候了，希望你们及早行动起来。（附图片）
