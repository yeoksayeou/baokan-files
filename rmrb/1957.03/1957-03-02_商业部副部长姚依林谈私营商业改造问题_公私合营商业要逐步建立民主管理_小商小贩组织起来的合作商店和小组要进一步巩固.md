Xinhua News Agency, March 1st: At the Seventh National Conference of Commercial Bureau Directors on February 28th, Yao Yilin, Vice Minister of Commerce, stated that the transformation of private commerce this year should be carried out with more in-depth and meticulous work, based on the established principles and policies of the State Council last year.

Yao Yilin said that the central task for joint state-private commercial enterprises that have already implemented fixed interest rates this year is to gradually establish democratic management of enterprises, carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and systematically summarize the historical experience of private commercial operation and management.

Yao Yilin said that all joint state-private enterprises should participate in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, with the same goals and tasks as state-owned retail enterprises. In the campaign, in addition to paying attention to promoting the initiative of the workers, we should also pay attention to promoting the initiative of private personnel, and we must pay special attention to strengthening policy education for all personnel, so that they understand that increasing production, practicing economy, and implementing policies are consistent. It is necessary to accumulate funds for the state through internal savings of the enterprise under the condition of implementing policies. It is absolutely forbidden to increase accumulation by adopting capitalist business methods that deceive consumers and deduct from producers, and it is not allowed to violate the state's planned supply policies and price policies. In addition, an education on integrity and devotion to public duty and cherishing state property should be conducted among workers and private personnel to eliminate the phenomena of corruption and waste that exist in some joint ventures.

Yao Yilin said that some localities merged some joint state-private shops last year, some of which were appropriate, but many mergers were inappropriate, making it inconvenient for consumers to purchase. In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, an inspection should be carried out, and inappropriate mergers should be restored, and it should be prevented from continuing to occur during the campaign due to one-sidedly emphasizing the convenience of leadership and management and economic accounting. The leadership institutions (district stores) of many joint state-private shops were established during the upsurge of socialist transformation last year. These institutions were necessary at the time, but now they can be appropriately streamlined and merged. Loans to joint state-private shops increased a lot last year, which was also necessary. This year, it should generally not be increased again, and last year's experience should be summarized to stipulate the inventory quota, loan index, and turnover frequency of each joint state-private shop.

Regarding small vendors, Yao Yilin said that the central task this year is to consolidate the already organized cooperative shops and cooperative groups and improve their socialist consciousness. There are still a considerable number of small vendors in a few places who have not been organized, and they should continue to be organized. In addition, it should be noted that there may be a considerable off-season this spring and summer, and at the same time, the supply of some commodities is insufficient, so it is necessary to be responsible for arranging the turnover of small vendors and their lives. During the peak season last year, due to the shortage of many commodities, capitalist ideology had developed in some small vendors, and a few members of cooperative shops had attempted to secede from the cooperative shops to work independently, and some cooperative groups did not work. Now this situation has changed, and due to the arrival of the off-season, these people will come back to ask for state assistance. In addition to advocating using the peak season to support the off-season, we should also assist them, but we should use this opportunity to conduct socialist education for them and all small vendors. Yao Yilin also suggested that all localities continue to promote the method of extracting mutual aid and cooperation funds from cooperative group members to subsidize the public welfare of group members, and put forward the requirement to continue strengthening the work of central stores.

Yao Yilin also proposed that this year, a part of the strength should be drawn to summarize the historical experience of private commerce in operation and management in our country. He suggested that all localities select some enterprises to mobilize all employees and private personnel to conduct a comprehensive summary of the historical operating methods and internal management systems of these enterprises.

    公私合营商业要逐步建立民主管理
    小商小贩组织起来的合作商店和小组要进一步巩固
    新华社1日讯  商业部副部长姚依林2月28日在第七届全国商业厅局长会议上发言说，今年对私营商业的改造应当根据国务院去年既定的方针政策，进行更加深入细致的工作。
    姚依林说，已实行定息的公私合营商业今年的中心任务，是逐步建立企业的民主管理，开展增产节约运动和有计划的总结私营商业经营管理的历史经验。
    姚依林说，一切公私合营企业都应当参加增产节约运动，其目标和任务同国营零售企业相同。在运动中，除了注意发扬职工群众的积极性以外，还应当注意发扬私方人员的积极性，并且要特别注意加强对全体人员的政策教育，使他们懂得增产节约和执行政策是一致的，必须在执行政策的条件下通过企业内部的节约来为国家积累资金，决不可以采用欺骗消费者和克扣生产者的资本主义经营方法来增大积累，不可以违反国家的计划供应政策和价格政策。此外，还要在职工和私方人员中进行一次廉洁奉公、爱护国家财产的教育，以消除目前有些合营企业中存在的贪污浪费现象。
    姚依林说，去年有些地方合并了一些公私合营商店，其中有些是恰当的，但有不少合并得不恰当，使消费者购买不便。在增产节约运动中，应当进行一次检查，合并得不恰当的应当恢复，并且应该防止在运动中继续发生由于片面地强调领导管理方便和经济核算而盲目合并的偏向。去年社会主义改造高潮时成立了很多公私合营商店的领导机构（区店），这些机构在当时是必要的，但是现在可以适当地精简、合并。公私合营商店的贷款，去年增加很多，这也是必要的，今年一般不应当再增加，并应总结去年经验，规定每个公私合营商店的库存定额、贷款指标和周转次数。
    在小商小贩方面，姚依林说，今年的中心任务是巩固已经组织起来了的合作商店、合作小组和提高他们的社会主义觉悟。有少数地方还有相当数量的小商小贩没有组织起来，应当继续加以组织。此外，要注意到今年春、夏可能有相当长的淡季，同时某些商品货源不足，因此要负责安排小商贩的营业额和他们的生活。去年旺季由于许多商品供不应求，在一部分小商小贩中，资本主义思想曾经有所发展，有少数合作商店成员曾经企图脱离合作商店去单干，有些合作小组不起作用。现在这种情况已经变化了，由于淡季来临，这部分人又将回过来要求国家扶助。除了提倡以旺养淡外，我们还应当对他们扶助，但是应当利用这个时机对他们以及全体小商贩进行一次社会主义教育。姚依林还建议各地继续推广从合作小组成员中提取互助合作基金以补助小组成员公共福利的办法，以及提出了继续加强中心店工作的要求。
    姚依林还提出今年要抽出一部分力量来总结我国私营商业在经营管理上的历史经验。他建议各地选择一些企业发动全体职工和私方人员对这些企业历史上的经营方法和内部管理制度进行全面的总结。
