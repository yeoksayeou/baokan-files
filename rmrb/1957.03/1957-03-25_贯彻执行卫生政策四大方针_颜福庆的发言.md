　　Implement the Four Major Guidelines of Health Policy
　　Yan Fuqing's Speech
　　I fully agree with and support the reports of Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and all the leading comrades. There has been significant development in all areas over the past year. Socialist construction has taken another big step forward. Industry and commerce have all been transformed into joint state-private enterprises, agriculture and handicrafts have basically completed cooperativization, and medical services have also made great progress. There are now 39 medical schools and colleges nationwide, an increase of eight medical colleges compared to 1955, including four colleges of traditional Chinese medicine. Private hospitals have basically been converted into public ones, and the number of beds has increased. Many private practitioners have joined public hospitals and become state medical cadres. Although we have achieved many of the above successes, we still cannot keep up with the development of the situation and lag far behind the needs of the people.

　　Some Shortcomings in Health Work
　　Based on the four major guidelines of health policy, it is not difficult to find many shortcomings, even errors, in our work: First, regarding the guideline of prevention first. Medical workers still tend to emphasize clinical practice and neglect prevention. High school graduates are more willing to apply for medical departments than for public health departments. This thinking is still very common. Health administrative cadres in various places also focus on clinical practice. The key work of health and epidemic prevention stations is epidemic prevention, and the scope is relatively broad, including regular health supervision of environmental health, occupational health, school health, nutrition and health, investigation and prevention of infectious diseases, disinfection and pest control, preventive health supervision, health care organizations, etc. These few tasks are the important points of health education in medical colleges. From the provinces and cities to the health and epidemic prevention work in various places, we feel that the overall quality is low. Only some general patriotic health campaigns and the work of eliminating the four pests are carried out, but the work is not in-depth and cannot cooperate with preventive health construction. The purpose of maternal and child health stations is to protect the health of women and children, but the same situation also occurs in the work. The main reason for these problems is the lack of public health professionals. However, on the other hand, another special phenomenon has emerged. It is said that last year, not many graduates from the public health departments of medical colleges were actually accepted by various health administration and epidemic prevention units, and these graduates have studied many of the above-mentioned public health professional courses and are good public health and epidemic prevention science professionals. All health units should be eager to get them. Now the opposite is true, everyone wants clinical medical personnel, which proves that the society's emphasis on public health doctors is still not enough. Some medical educators have even suggested that it is too early to set up public health departments, which is obviously also wrong.

　　Secondly, regarding the guideline of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, this work is also done poorly, and not many doctors are willing to go to factories and rural areas to serve. The investigation and research on occupational diseases is also not thorough and universal enough. Thirdly, although the guideline of uniting Chinese and Western medicine has now achieved mutual unity and cooperation, this is only the first step. Our goal is to integrate Chinese and Western medicine to become China's scientific medicine, in order to enrich world medicine. But how to achieve this goal, there is still a lack of correct and reliable methods. Fourthly, health work must be combined with the masses, this guideline is firmly established. However, we have not done enough to popularize health education. For example, the ban on spitting is the most effective measure for preventing tuberculosis. The prevention and treatment of trachoma must also be well organized among the masses to carry out promotion. But these works have not been widely carried out.

　　Strengthen the Political and Ideological Education of Teaching Staff
　　The intellectuals themselves have undergone major changes in the past year. The Party and the government have put forward more clear guidelines for intellectuals, which can probably be divided into two aspects: first, we are required to shoulder the responsibility of marching towards science; second, to improve our political level. The march towards science has now reached a climax. Our intellectuals have enthusiastically responded to this great call, actively participated, attached importance to research work, and strived to raise China's science to the international level within twelve years. These are all good phenomena, but at the same time, some deviations have also appeared. For example, some teaching staff have requested to be released from work for further study and to take doctoral degrees. Many nurses and technicians are also restless and want to go to university. These desires to improve are good, but our main task is to run education and train teachers. In the current situation of extreme shortage of medical and teaching personnel, it is inappropriate to abandon teaching to engage in research. These all show that our political thinking is not high enough. To correct these deviations, we must strengthen ideological education and recognize the primary aspect of first obeying the national interest. Science and technology are just tools, and political thought is our guide. Only with a high degree of political awareness can we fully exert the effectiveness of science and technology and not lose our way. Most of our intellectuals can appreciate this point, which is reflected in the fact that in the past year, many medical workers, scientific and educational workers have joined the Communist Party, and more have joined the democratic parties, actively participating in systematic political studies, and expanding political life in collective organizations.

　　Unified Allocation of Medical Personnel
　　No matter what undertaking is to be launched, it is always inseparable from the two major factors of manpower and material resources. China's socialist construction is being carried out on a large scale, and we must "increase production and practice thrift." We must unite increasing production and practicing thrift, and save as much as possible without hindering production. The conservation of both manpower and material resources is very important, but as far as medical care is concerned, the conservation of manpower is even more important. Because the current medical community cannot adapt to the needs of the objective form, it is mainly manifested in the lack of manpower. We should make an overall plan for manpower and allocate it in a unified manner. For example, in Shanghai, there are more than 80 medical units that have recently been changed from private to public, including 60 hospitals and 20 laboratories. These hospitals generally have fewer beds and more doctors, because although the sparrow is small, it must have all its organs. Manpower allocation cannot be reduced. If merged into larger hospitals, a lot of manpower can definitely be saved. Some hospitals in various enterprises have not yet fully exerted their potential, and there are also more medical personnel. Surplus personnel should be transferred out for appropriate allocation.

　　Shanghai Medical College Should Be Consolidated and Consolidated on the Existing Basis
　　Two years ago, Shanghai First Medical College was preparing to move to Chongqing, and development was once suspended. Last year, the central government reconfirmed that not only should it continue to operate in Shanghai, but it should also continue to develop. The teaching and medical personnel required for the newly built Chongqing Medical College are entirely the responsibility of our college. Secondly, it is also necessary to support Xinjiang Medical College. These many tasks are very arduous. Our college currently has 3,178 students, six affiliated hospitals, and 1,695 beds, as well as nursing schools and cadre schools. However, the entire college has only 476 teaching staff. It is difficult to undertake the tasks of teaching, medical care, and research with this limited manpower, and it is also necessary to improve the quality of teaching. Therefore, adverse phenomena have occurred, affecting the health of the teaching staff. According to recent statistics, among the 76 senior professors, 11 are ill, accounting for 14.1%, of which half are on sick leave and half are working while sick. According to government policy, it is believed that the development of the past was too rapid, and development must be temporarily slowed down, and this year should be used to consolidate and consolidate the existing foundation. Putting improving quality as a central task. This is completely correct and very necessary. To achieve this goal, we must first consolidate the basic team. To make this hen able to lay eggs, we must first enrich and cultivate its gestational function. Therefore, in addition to cultivating undergraduate students, our college must also pay attention to the training of teachers and professional advanced personnel. This work has been done in the past, and it must be done step by step and systematically in the future, and listed as one of the central tasks of the college.

　　Please criticize and correct these opinions, all the committee members.

　　贯彻执行卫生政策四大方针
　　颜福庆的发言
    我完全同意并且拥护毛主席、周总理和各位首长的报告，一年来在各方面都有很大的发展。社会主义建设又向前跨进一大步。工商业已经全部公私合营，农业和手工业已基本上完成合作化，医务事业也同样有了很大进展，现在全国已有医药院校三十九所，比1955年新建了八个医学院，其中中医学院有四所，私立医院基本上已改为公立，床位增加了。不少开业医生加入公立医院已成为国家医务干部。我们虽取得了上述许多成绩，但仍然赶不上形势的发展，远落在人民需要的后面。
      卫生工作中的一些缺点
    根据卫生政策的四大方针来检查，就不难发现我们工作中的许多缺点，甚至错误：第一、关于预防为主的方针。医务工作者还存在着注重临床而忽视预防的倾向。高中毕业生都愿考医疗系，不愿考卫生系。这种思想还极为普遍。各地卫生行政干部也同样是注重临床。卫生防疫站的重点工作是防疫，范围是比较广的，包括环境卫生、劳动卫生、学校卫生、营养卫生等经常性卫生监督，流行病的调查防治，消毒杀虫和预防性卫生监督，保健组织等。这几项工作就是医学院卫生教育的重要的几点。从省市到各地的卫生防疫工作，我们感到普遍的质量低。只做些一般化的爱国卫生运动和除四害的工作，而工作不深入，不能配合预防性的卫生建设。妇幼保健站的目的是保护妇婴健康，但在工作中也产生同样情况。这些问题产生的主要原因是缺乏卫生专业人才。但是另一方面，则出现了另一种特殊现象，据说去年医学院卫生系毕业生实际为各卫生行政和防疫单位接受的就不多，而这些毕业生正是学了上面许多卫生专业课程，是良好的卫生防疫科学专业人才，各卫生单位应该是求之不得。现在则正相反，大家都要临床医务人员，这证明社会上对卫生预防医生的重视还很不够。有的医学教育家甚至提出办卫生系是否太早的意见，这显然也是错误的。
    其次关于面向工农兵的方针，这方面工作也做得较差，能到工厂、农村去服务的医生就不多。对职业病的调查研究也不够深入普遍。第三、团结中西医的方针虽然现在已经互相团结合作了，但这还仅仅是第一步。我们的目的，是要把中西医贯通起来，使成为中国的科学医学，以丰富世界医学。但如何达到这目标，到现在还缺乏正确可靠的办法。第四、卫生工作必须与群众相结合，这方针是确定不移的。而我们对于卫生宣教工作，还做得不够普及。例如禁止吐痰运动，是防痨的最有效的措施。防治砂眼也必须很好组织群众，从事推广。但这些工作都未能广泛展开。
    加强教学人员的政治思想教育
    这一年来知识分子本身在起着重大变化。党和政府向知识分子提出了更明确的方针，大概可分为两方面，其一、要求我们担负起向科学进军的责任，二、为提高我们的政治水平。向科学进军现在已经到了高潮。我们知识分子都热情地响应这一伟大号召，积极参加，重视研究工作，争取在十二年内把我国的科学提高到国际水平，这些都是好现象，但同时也出现了某些偏向，例如有的教学人员就要求脱产进修，要考副博士学位。有不少护士和技术员也不安于位，都想考大学。这些要求上进的心情都是好的，不过我们的主要任务是办教育，培养师资，在目前极端缺乏医务和教学人才的情况下，丢开教学来专搞研究，就不妥当。这些都说明我们的政治思想还不够高，要纠正这些偏向，就必须加强思想教育，认清首先服从国家利益的主要方面。科学技术不过是一种工具，而政治思想是我们的指南，有了高度的政治觉悟，才能充分发挥科学技术的效能，才不会迷失方向。我们知识分子，多数都能体会到这一点，表现在近一年来有不少医务工作者、科学教育工作者，加入了共产党，更多的加入了民主党派，积极参加系统的政治学习，在集体组织中，扩大了政治生活。
        统一调配医务人员
    无论兴办什么事业，总离不开人力、物力两大因素。我国的社会主义建设正在大规模的进行，我们必须“增加生产，厉行节约”。要把增产和节约统一起来，要在不妨碍生产情况下尽量地节约。人力和物力的节约都很重要，但就医务来说，则人力的节约就更其重要。因为现在医务界不能适应客观形式需要，主要就表现在人力缺乏方面，我们应就人力作通盘筹划，统一调配。例如：上海市近来由私立改为公立的，就有八十多个医务单位，其中有医院六十所，化验所二十个。这些医院一般都是床位较少，而医师则较多，因为尽管麻雀虽小，但须五脏俱全。人力配备不能减省，如果合并成为较大的医院，一定可以节约不少人力。各企业单位的医院，其中有些还未充分发挥潜力，医务人员也较多，应将多余人员抽调出来作适当调备。
    上海医学院应在现有基础上整顿巩固
    上海第一医学院在二年以前，曾准备迁往重庆，遂一度停止发展。去年复经中央确定不但要在上海继续办下去，而且还须继续发展，新建的重庆医学院，所需教学和医务人员，完全由我院负责配备。其次还须支援新疆医学院，这许多任务是非常艰巨的。我院现有学生三千一百七十八名，附属医院六所，病床一千六百九十五张，尚有护校和干校。而全院教学人员只有四百七十六人，以此有限的人力，要担负教学医务研究的任务，又须提高教学质量，是有困难的。因此产生不良的现象，影响到教学人员的健康。据最近统计，在七十六个高级教授中，患病者就有十一人，占14.1％，其中有半休有全休，也有带病从公的。根据政府政策，认为过去事业发展得太快，必须暂缓发展，要利用今年一年的时间，就现有基础加以整顿巩固。把提高质量列为一项中心工作。这完全是正确的，而且是非常必要的。欲达成这一目的，首先必须巩固基本队伍，要这只母鸡能够生蛋，首先就要充实和培养它的孕育机能。因此我院除了培养本科学生之外，还必须注意到师资及专业进修人员的培养。这工作过去已经在做，以后要有步骤有计划地做，列为本院中心工作之一。
    这些意见是否正确，敬请各位委员批评指教。
