Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Xinhua News Agency reporter Ding Baofang reports: The significant contributions of Beijing women in higher education and scientific research powerfully refute the old society's claim that "women's intelligence is inferior to men's."

In the capital's institutions of higher learning, the ranks of female teachers have grown to more than 2,400, double the number in 1953. Now, on average, one out of every four teachers is a woman. There are already more than 600 senior female teaching staff members at the lecturer level and above. Women account for half of the thirteen senior researchers at the Institute of Chemistry. In the past, female researchers in the Chinese mathematics field were extremely rare, but now female researchers account for one-seventh of all researchers at the Institute of Mathematics.

The capital's female intellectuals are not only distributed in well-known departments such as medicine, teacher training, and the arts, but also engaged in teaching and research in many fields such as solid-state physics, geology, paleontology, entomology, genetics, cell embryology, plant protection, horticulture and fruit trees, economics, and philosophy. There are also senior female researchers engaged in research in some of the newest scientific departments such as aerodynamics, semiconductors, nuclear physics, computing technology, and plasticity mechanics.

Aerodynamicist Lu Shijia teaches at the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics. She is actively preparing to open a new course in rarefied gas dynamics soon. Cytologist Wu Suxuan discovered the phenomenon of nuclei penetrating the cell wall under normal conditions in the vegetative bodies of many plants. Jiang Lijing, an associate researcher currently working in the polymer chemistry group at the Institute of Chemistry, just returned from the United States last year. In a relatively short period, Jiang Lijing has identified the urushiol in Chinese lacquer while studying its chemical structure.

People often think that only men can engage in fieldwork. However, Chi Jishang, a female rock expert and professor at the Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration College, was among China's first geologists to cross the Qilian Mountains through Gansu and Qinghai provinces last year. This slender female geologist, around forty years old, climbed mountains over 4,000 meters above sea level along with the men, carrying dozens of kilograms of rocks on her back, and traveled five or six hundred kilometers of uneven mountain roads in a month. During her two months in the Chaka area in the southern Qilian Mountains, she conducted a systematic research investigation of the Chaka area magmatic complex, and put forward the theoretical basis for the metallogenic regularity and mineral genesis of the entire Qilian Mountains. She is currently guiding three graduate students in related research. Professor Wu Ting, who teaches plant biochemistry at Beijing Agricultural University, has more than ten years of teaching experience. However, one hour before each lecture, she always organizes the material well to make the lecture more organized and clear.

### 在高等教育和科学事业中  北京女知识分子有重要贡献

    在高等教育和科学事业中
    北京女知识分子有重要贡献
    新华社讯　新华社记者丁宝芳报道：北京妇女在高等教育和科学研究工作中的重要贡献，有力地推翻了旧社会所谓“女子智慧不如男”的说法。
    在首都的高等学校里，女教师的队伍已经发展到二千四百多人，比1953年增加一倍，现在平均四个教师中就有一个女的。讲师以上的女高级教学人员已有六百多人了。在化学研究所十三个高级研究人员中，女的就占半数。过去，中国数学界中的女研究人员是凤毛麟角，但是现在数学研究所里，女研究人员已占全所研究人员的七分之一。
    首都的女知识分子不仅分布在医学、师范和艺术等为人们熟知的部门，在固体物理、地质、古生物、昆虫学、遗传学、细胞胚胎学、植物保护、园艺果树、经济学、哲学等很多方面都有妇女从事教学和研究工作。在一些最新的科学部门如空气动力学、半导体、原子核物理、计算技术和塑性力学方面也有女高级研究人员从事研究工作。
    空气动力学家陆士嘉在北京航空学院担任教学工作。她正积极准备在不久开设稀薄空气动力学这门新课。细胞学家吴素宣在许多植物的营养体中，发现细胞核在正常情况下穿壁的现象。现在在化学研究所高分子化学组工作的副研究员蒋丽金是去年才从美国回来的。蒋丽金在较短的时间内研究中国漆的化学结构过程中，已经找出了中国漆的漆酚所在。
    在人们印象中总认为只有男人才能够从事野外勘探工作。可是去年中国有史以来第一批横跨甘肃、青海两省穿过祁连山的地质学家中就有一个女岩石专家、北京地质勘探学院教授池际尚。这位瘦瘦的大约四十来岁的女地质学家和男人们一起，翻过拔海四千公尺以上的高山，身上背上几十斤重的石头，在一个月的时间内跑了五六百公里的高低不平的山路。她在祁连山南部茶卡地区的两个月中，对茶卡地区岩浆杂岩体作了系统的研究调查，对整个祁连山的成矿规律，矿产成因提出了理论依据。现在她正在指导三个研究生从事有关的研究。在北京农业大学担任植物生物化学教学工作的吴亭教授已经有十多年的教学经验。但，在每次讲课前的一小时，她总是很好地组织材料，使讲课更有条理和清楚易懂。
