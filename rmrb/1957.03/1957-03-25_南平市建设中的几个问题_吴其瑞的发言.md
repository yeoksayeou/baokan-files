I fully endorse Premier Zhou's report to the conference, and I agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the Standing Committee and Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech.

I am attending this conference as a representative of the Nanping City Political Consultative Conference in Fujian. Therefore, I would like to talk about the municipal construction of Nanping City. Nanping's establishment as a city is a recent event. At the end of last year, we received a notice from higher authorities that the State Council had approved the establishment of Nanping as a city. After the election of representatives to the Municipal People's Congress, the first session of the first Municipal People's Congress was convened, and the Municipal People's Committee was formed. The Municipal People's Committee officially began its work on January 15th this year, less than three months ago. Therefore, it is a newly established city and the smallest among all cities in the country.

Nanping is a small city with a population of around 65,000. It is located on the upper reaches of the Min River, at the confluence of the Jianxi and Shaxi Rivers, controlling the transportation hub of northern Fujian. By water, the Min River can reach the provincial capital of Fuzhou; upstream along the Shaxi River, it can reach Shaxian and Yong'an, and from the Shaxi branch, upstream along the Futun River, it can reach Shunchang and Shaowu; upstream along the Jianxi River, it can reach Jian'ou. By road, the Nan-Yong Highway leads to Yong'an, the Nan-Jian Road leads to Jianning, and the Nan-Rao Road leads to Shangrao in Jiangxi Province. Since the completion of the Yingxia Railway, it can form a joint transportation network with the national railway network. Soon, the Nan-Fu Railway will be completed, allowing direct access to Fuzhou. In today's context of national defense and the task of liberating Taiwan, Nanping City has even greater significance. Since liberation, Nanping City has developed extremely rapidly. It is an emerging, or rather, a burgeoning small city. Its characteristics are convenient transportation and great prospects for development in light industry. The factories that have already been built include: Nanping Cement Plant, Chemical Plant, Match Factory, Machine Factory, Rosin Factory, and Power Plant. The Nanping Paper Mill is currently under construction. Therefore, Nanping is not only the transportation hub of northern Fujian but will also become the leading city in northern Fujian in terms of economy, culture, education, and municipal construction in the future. The central government's decision to change Nanping to a city establishment is correct. The people of Nanping are so concerned and excited about this decision, and the entire city unanimously expressed their support.

We are now carrying out municipal construction work. On the one hand, we must have a long-term plan for municipal construction, and on the other hand, we must also have current measures. There are several specific problems that we need to solve at present. I think these problems may be common to small cities in general, and they need strong support from higher authorities to be gradually resolved. At the same time, it is also necessary to reflect the situation to draw attention to it.

  (1) Excrement Disposal Problem: In recent years, the sanitation situation in Nanping City has improved significantly, achieving certain results. However, people passing through Nanping City have also raised many opinions and criticisms about the city's sanitation, the most important of which is focused on the excrement problem. This is the most important issue in Nanping City's sanitation work, and it has never been resolved in the history of Nanping. In other cities, excrement is a source of fertilizer for farmers and a treasure for agricultural production. Excrement has to be bought with money. However, the situation in Nanping City is the opposite. Before liberation, no one wanted the excrement in Nanping City. Residents built toilets on the city's ditches, and the excrement flowed into the Min River with the ditch water. After liberation, this situation has changed. During the fertilizer accumulation season, farmers come to the city to transport some of it away, of course, for free. After the fertilizer accumulation season, fewer people want it, and the excrement overflows, making it unbearable to approach. At this time, not only can the excrement not be sold, but money must be paid to hire people to carry it away. For example, if institutions and schools are in a hurry to have someone carry it away, they have to pay per load, as much as one dime per load, or as little as five cents per load. In addition to paying the price, one must also be very polite and use a pleading tone for people to agree. Otherwise, let them be in a hurry! The lack of a way out for excrement is, of course, due to the lack of large areas of farmland within 20 to 30 miles of the city. It is not cost-effective to transport it from afar. In recent years, land near the urban area has been used to build warehouses, houses, and open sports fields, and the area of vegetable gardens has been shrinking, reducing the demand for excrement even further, making the problem more and more serious. According to the health department, the city produces about 700 loads of excrement a day, and transporting and disposing of it is a major task. In the future, due to urban construction, the area of arable land and vegetable gardens will become smaller and smaller, and objective conditions will become increasingly unfavorable for solving the problem. Our supply of excrement exceeds demand, there is absolutely no shortage, and no one hoards for speculation. This is where the problem lies.

  (2) Sports Field Problem: The original sports field in Nanping City was only about 6,400 square meters. For several years, there has been a demand for a new sports field. This problem was basically solved last year. We purchased more than 50 mu of vegetable garden land outside the North Gate to be used as a sports field. However, most of the budget was spent on the acquisition, leaving little money left. In addition to mobilizing voluntary labor and hiring workers to dig the soil, the 80th unit also strongly supported us by using bulldozers to help us level the earthwork. Now the budget is exhausted, and the project has not been completed, falling short of success. The sports field is not yet usable, it is just a prototype there. The track, equipment, and buildings have not been built, and the avenue leading to the field has not been opened. If it is not completed and continued to be built, it will soon become a wasteland. Now the vegetable farmers already have something to say, they say: "Buying the land and leaving it there unused, why was there such a rush to acquire it at the time!" It can be inferred that if this sports field is not really built in time to play its role, not only will the original vegetable farmers have opinions, but the broad masses will also have opinions. In fact, Nanping City is also in urgent need of this sports field. In recent years, county sports meets, special district sports meets, and various sports competitions have all required the construction of such a sports field. It is closely related to the development of sports in Nanping City and Nanping Special District, the improvement of sports levels, and the training of sports cadres in the future.

  (3) Road Construction Problem: The strange phenomenon of uneven roads, dim lights, and unreliable telephones in Nanping before liberation has now been basically changed. However, the unevenness of the roads still needs to be addressed. The reconstruction and expansion of the roads in the city over the past few years have completely changed the appearance of the city. Now there are still Zhongshan East Road and Shengli Road that remain as they were. These two roads are the main roads in the urban area and must be reconstructed to facilitate traffic. According to the construction department, the city's construction investment this year is extremely limited, and it has not been possible to build these two roads. For several years, the people have been eagerly hoping to build these two roads, and everyone is mentally prepared, just waiting for the government to notify them to demolish houses and expand the roads. In the past, when the city was not yet established, the strength was insufficient, and the delay was understandable. This year, the city has been established, and we should try to realize the construction of these two roads to complete the road system in the urban area. I think the construction of these two roads is not for the sake of grandstanding, but more importantly, to show the new socialist atmosphere of Nanping City.

  (4) Housing Problem for Construction Cadres: Since liberation, the development of infrastructure construction in Nanping has been very prominent. Hundreds of new large buildings have been built in the urban area, like cranes standing among chickens. However, the vast majority of the newly built houses are public houses for institutions, schools, and hospitals, and there are very few civilian infrastructure constructions. Judging from the overall situation, civilian houses have actually decreased. This is due to the expansion of roads, the acquisition of private houses for the construction of institutional houses, and other reasons. With the reduction of civilian houses, the population is increasing every day, which has created a tense housing situation in Nanping City. It is understood that some institutional cadres have to sleep on their desks at night, and some cadres cannot reunite with their families because they cannot rent houses. General housing is also very crowded, with several families living in a small house, with stoves arranged everywhere, which is not only unsanitary but also poses a fire hazard. It is a very urgent request to build some civilian houses for cadres to rent. I think we should try to build simple cadre houses like new villages to improve the living conditions of cadres. This can also alleviate the difficulty of overcrowding in some residents' houses.

This year is the beginning of the increase production and practice economy campaign. The four issues I have raised above are all related to money, and there are contradictions in them. Of course, these are contradictions among the people, not antagonistic contradictions. Since we know that there are contradictions, why do we raise them? I think there are the following three reasons:

  (1) Nanping has been established as a city, and the people have certain hopes for municipal construction. On the one hand, we must persuade and educate the masses who have unrealistic ideas. On the other hand, we should reflect the situation to draw the government's attention to the construction of Nanping. I think a newly established city should not be treated the same as old cities and should not be given an equal share. For Nanping City, where the foundation of municipal construction is very weak, we hope that the higher authorities will give strong support and help it solve some specific difficulties, so that the work of establishing the city can be carried out more smoothly.

  (2) Nanping City is a transportation hub and a must-pass for international friends entering and leaving Fujian. The city's construction has significance for external propaganda. The impression of Nanping, whether good or bad, affects the achievements of socialist construction in Fujian Province. The perception is important, and its impact is great. A single word of praise or blame can be transmitted to friendly countries. Nanping is small, but its role is great.

  (3) Nanping City will have a rapid population growth and the area will continue to expand in the future. At the beginning of the city's establishment, we must lay a good construction foundation and make certain material and regulatory preparations, so that we can avoid being passive everywhere in the future and end up treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts. The proper resolution of the above-mentioned issues is of great importance to the future development of the city.

The opinions I have expressed above are my personal views. Please correct me if they are right or wrong. (Attached picture)

### 南平市建设中的几个问题　吴其瑞的发言

　　南平市建设中的几个问题
　　吴其瑞的发言
    我完全拥护周总理向大会所作的报告，并同意陈叔通副主席的常务委员会工作报告，和陈云副总理的发言。
    我是代表福建南平市政协列席这次大会的，因此我就南平市政建设问题谈一谈。南平建市还是最近的事。去年底接到上级通知，国务院已批准南平建市，经过市人民代表大会代表的选举，召开了第一届第一次市人民代表大会，产生了市人民委员会。今年1月15日，市人委会正式开始办公，成立于今不满三个月，因此是一个新生市，在全国各市中也是一个最小的弟弟。
    南平是一个小城市，人口在六万五千人上下，位于闽江上游，当建溪与沙溪汇流的地点，控闽北交通的枢纽。水路有：闽江可以下达省会福州；溯沙溪而上可达沙县、永安，由沙溪分支循富屯溪而上可达顺昌、邵武；溯建溪而上可以通建瓯。公路有：南永公路通永安，南建路通建宁，南饶路通江西省的上饶。自鹰厦铁路建成之后可以和全国铁路网构成联运，不久南福铁路完成又可以直达福州。在今天国防意义上，解放台湾任务上说，南平市更有其重大的意义。解放以来南平市的发展是极其迅速的，是一个新兴的，更恰当的说一个勃兴的小城市。它的特点是交通便利，并且在轻工业方面有很大发展的前途。现在已建成的工厂有：南平水泥厂、化工厂、火柴厂、机器厂、松香厂、电厂，正在建设中的有南平造纸厂。因此南平不仅是闽北交通的枢纽而且今后将在经济上，文化教育上，市政建设上成为闽北的首要城市。把南平改为市的建制是中央的正确的决定。南平人民对这一决定是那么关心，那么兴奋，全市人民都一致表示拥护。
    现在我们对市政建设正在开展工作，一方面要有市政建设的远景规划，一方面也要有当前的措施。目前摆在我们面前的有几个具体问题需要解决。我想这几个问题可能是一般小城市中带有普遍性的问题，有待于上级的大力支持，才能逐步取得解决，同时把情况反映一下引起注意也是很必要的。
      （一）粪便处理问题：几年来南平市的清洁卫生情况有了很大的改进，取得一定的成绩。但是过往南平市的人们，对市的清洁卫生也提了不少意见，给予不少的批评，其中最主要的集中于粪便问题。这是南平市清洁卫生工作中头等重要的问题，也是南平有史以来所没有解决的。在其他城市粪便是农民取肥的源泉，农业生产的宝贝。粪便是要用钱论担买来的。但是南平市情况恰恰与此相反，解放前南平市粪便是没有人要的，居民都在城里沟渠上建厕所，粪便随沟水流入闽江。解放后这个情况已经改变了，在积肥季节里农民们进城运走一部分，当然是白送的。过了积肥季节要的人少了，粪便横流，不可向迩。这时粪便不只不能卖钱，反而要贴钱雇人挑走，如机关、学校急的时候要人挑走，就要论担贴钱，多的一角一担，少的五分一挑，雇人挑粪除了给价之外还要很有礼貌地、带有央求的口气，才肯答应，不然由你去急罢！粪便没有出路当然是由于附城二三十里内没有大片的农田，远处来运不合算。近几年来城区附近辟地建筑仓库、房屋、开运动场，菜园地面积日益缩小，粪便的需要量更少了，问题也就越来越严重。据卫生部门反映市内一天大约出粪便七百余担，把它运走加以处理实在是件大事。今后由于城市建设，耕地、菜园地面积越来越少，客观条件越向不利于解决方面转变。我们的粪便供过于求，绝无脱产的现象，也没有人屯积居奇，这是问题所在。
    （二）运动场问题：南平市原有运动场大约只有六千四百平方公尺。几年来一直闹着要另辟运动场。去年这个问题基本上解决了。我们在北城外收购了五十几亩菜园地辟为运动场。但是在收购中用去预算的大部分，余下的款项无多了。除了发动义务劳动，雇工挖土外，80部还大力支持我们，用推土机帮助我们削平土方。现在预算已完了，工程还没有完成，工亏一篑。运动场还不能用，只是一个雏型摆在那里。跑道、设备、房屋，都没有搞起来，通向场的大道也没有开辟。假如不竟全功继续建设起来，不久就要变成一块荒地了。现在菜农们已经有话了，他们说：“买了地摆在那里没用，当时何必急急收购呢！”可以推测这个运动场真的不及时搞起来，发挥它的作用，不仅是原来的菜农有意见，广大群众也一定有意见。事实上南平市也急于需要这个运动场。几年来县运动会、专区运动会、各种体育比赛都要求修建这样一个运动场，它对今后开展南平市、南平专区的体育运动和提高体育运动水平，培养体育干部都有密切的关系。
      （三）马路建设问题：解放前南平马路不平，电灯不明，电话不灵的怪现象，现在已经基本上改变了。但是马路不平还有待于继续努力。城内马路经几年来的改建、扩大使市的面貌完全改观。现在还有中山东路和胜利路仍然如旧，这两条马路是城区主要的道路，必须改建以利通行。据建设部门说今年市的建设投资极为有限，没有能够修建这两条马路。几年来人民都迫切希望修建这两条马路，大家思想上都有准备，只等政府通知就可以拆屋扩大。过去尚未建市，力量不够，拖延下来，是可以理解的。今年市已成立，应该尽量设法实现这两条马路的修建以完成城区马路的系统。我想修建这两条马路不是为了以壮观瞻，更主要的是显示南平市社会主义的新气象。
      （四）建筑干部住屋问题：解放以来南平基建的发展是很突出的，新建了百余幢大房屋座落在市区，犹如鹤立鸡群。但是新建的房屋绝大多数是机关、学校、医院的公用屋，民用基建是非常少有的。从整个情况来看，民用房屋还是有所减少。这是由于扩建马路，收购民房建筑机关房屋等等的关系，在民用房屋减少之下，人口又天天增加起来，就造成了南平市住屋紧张的现象。据了解有的机关干部夜里要在办公桌上睡觉，有的干部因为租不到房屋，一家不能团聚。一般住屋也很拥挤，一幢小小屋里住下几家人，各处排着炉灶，既不清洁卫生又有失火危险。希望建筑一些民用房屋，给干部租用是一个很迫切的要求。我想应该设法建筑简陋的干部房屋如新村的样子，以改善干部住居的条件。这样也可以调剂一部分居民房屋过挤的困难。
    今年是增产节约的开始，我提出上面四个问题，都是与钱打交道的，这里面就有了矛盾，当然是人民内部的矛盾，不是对抗性的矛盾。既然知道存在矛盾为什么又提出来呢？我想有下面三点理由：
      （1）南平建市了，人民对市政建设抱有一定的希望。一方面我们要对群众不现实的思想进行说服教育，一方面我们应该反映情况，以引起政府对南平建设的重视。我认为一个新成立的市，不应该和老的市同等对待，平分秋色，对市政建设基础很薄弱的南平市，我们盼望上级予以大力支持。帮助它解决一些具体困难，使建市的工作开展得更顺利。
      （2）南平市是一个交通的枢纽，国际友人进出福建必经之路。市的建设具有对外宣传的意义，对南平印象的好坏影响到福建省社会主义建设的成绩，观感所系作用颇大，一言毁誉，传及友邦。南平虽小，作用可大。
      （3）南平市在今后人口增长很快，地区也将不断扩大，建市之初必须打好一些建设基础，做好一定物质和规制的准备，今后才能免于处处被动，弄得头痛医头，脚痛医脚。上面所提的几个问题的适当解决都对今后市政的发展有很大的关系。
    上面谈的意见是我个人的观感，对与不对请大家指正。（附图片）
