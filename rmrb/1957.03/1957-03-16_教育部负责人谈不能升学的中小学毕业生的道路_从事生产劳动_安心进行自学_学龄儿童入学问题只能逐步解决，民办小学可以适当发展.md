Xinhua News Agency, March 15th: Our reporter recently interviewed an official from the Ministry of Education regarding the issue that there will be more junior high and higher primary school graduates unable to continue their studies this year compared to previous years, and a larger number of school-age children unable to enroll in schools.

The Ministry of Education official said that it is normal for not all primary and secondary school graduates to be able to continue their studies. Primary and secondary education is ordinary education, and its task is mainly to improve the cultural level of the people to meet the needs of socialist construction for a reserve labor force with a certain political awareness, cultural cultivation, and healthy physique; on the other hand, it is also necessary to send a certain number of qualified new students to higher and secondary schools. Therefore, most primary and secondary school students should engage in industrial and agricultural production labor after graduation, while only a small portion of graduates can continue their studies, which is as it should be. Socialist industrial and agricultural production requires producers to master certain cultural and technical knowledge. To this end, our country is increasingly demanding that educated youth invest in industrial and agricultural production labor. In fact, if workers and peasants master a certain amount of culture, it will definitely play a great role in improving productivity. For example, the vast majority of graduates from Soviet ten-year schools (equivalent to the level of high school in our country) participate in industrial and agricultural production. In 1953, 70% of the technical workers at the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory were graduates of ten-year schools. Therefore, it should not be considered an abnormal phenomenon, and it should not be considered a pity for primary and secondary school graduates to participate in production labor.

Regarding the issue of full enrollment of school-age children, the Ministry of Education official said that this will only be possible to resolve over a relatively long period of time in the future. Primary education is the basic education of the nation. Based on the state's financial strength, it can only gradually increase the enrollment rate of school-age children and gradually seek a solution. China is a large country with a rapidly growing population, and the development of primary education cannot make it possible for all school-age children to enroll in school for a considerable period of time, which is also very natural.

The official said that the development of education in New China has been very rapid. In the seven years or so since 1949, the development speed of primary and secondary schools is much faster than the development speed during the Kuomintang period from 1931 to 1946 (the highest year of development). In 1956, there were more than 5 million middle school students, an increase of nearly two and a half times compared with 1946. The number of primary school students is now more than 63 million, while there were only more than 23 million primary school students in 1946.

The official said that since the founding of the country, with the development of production, the state's investment in education has increased year by year. In 1956, it increased by 79.9% compared with 1952. In 1956, education expenditure accounted for 7.14% of the total state expenditure and 62.62% of the expenditure on cultural, educational, and health undertakings. Taking 1946, the highest year for the development of education during the Kuomintang rule, as an example, education expenditure did not even account for 1% of the total state expenditure. At present, the funding for primary education accounts for almost half of the education expenditure under the Ministry of Education; the funding for secondary education accounts for 30%. The state's investment in education is not small. If the development of primary and secondary education only considers the needs of the masses for their children to enroll in school and continue their studies, without considering the possibilities of the state's financial strength, it will inevitably affect the country's industrial construction and other construction undertakings, which is not in line with the long-term and fundamental interests of the people.

The official said that the people all hope to send their children to school, and this desire is understandable. However, at present, our country is concentrating its main efforts on economic construction, and education funding cannot be greatly increased. Under such circumstances, appropriately developing private primary schools based on the voluntariness and possibilities of the masses is a measure to solve the problem of enrollment for some school-age children. Therefore, the policy of allowing the masses to run schools must be affirmed and adhered to.

The official said that the number of students continuing their studies in primary and secondary schools in 1956 was relatively large, mainly because the enrollment plans of higher and secondary schools were somewhat too large. At the same time, last year our country was in a socialist upsurge, and all undertakings had great development, requiring more people, so it was necessary for schools to enroll more students. But this is only a temporary special phenomenon. From this year on, our construction undertakings will enter a normal situation, and it should not be like last year. At the same time, in recent years, the development of education has been too fast, which has already affected the quality of education to a certain extent. After the great development last year, schools at all levels have encountered difficulties in terms of school buildings, teachers, and equipment. Therefore, in the future, education work should follow the normal development law, taking into account both needs and possibilities in the development of undertakings, placing undertakings on a fully reliable foundation, and developing the number of schools on the principle of ensuring a certain quality.

The official said that for primary and secondary school graduates who cannot continue their studies, their path is to engage in industrial and agricultural production labor. Primary and secondary school graduates in rural areas who cannot continue their studies mainly engage in agricultural labor. Like Xu Jianchun, a graduate of a higher primary school in Yexian County, Shandong Province, and Hu Zhaokun, a junior high school dropout in Weixian County, Shandong Province, who participated in agricultural production in recent years, they correctly understood the significance of production labor and made outstanding contributions in labor, which are good examples for junior high and higher primary school graduates. Secondly, judging from the current development of industrial and agricultural production in our country, the state cannot immediately employ all primary and secondary school graduates who cannot continue their studies. Those who cannot continue their studies and do not have the conditions to participate in labor and work for a while should conscientiously study at home and prepare better conditions for future engagement in production labor or further studies.

The Ministry of Education official said that the above-mentioned issues should be widely publicized in society. Parents are required to have a correct understanding and adopt a correct attitude towards the issue of their children's further education and employment. If their children can continue their studies, they should be allowed to do so; if they cannot, parents should not discriminate against them or embarrass them, but should comfort and encourage them, actively try to make them engage in production labor, or, according to the specific circumstances and possible conditions, help them arrange self-study conditions and let them study at home.

The official finally said that the Ministry of Education recently issued a "Notice on Guiding Primary and Secondary School Graduates to Correctly Treat Further Education and Employment Issues." Various localities have already started work in this regard. In this work, we hope to receive strong support and assistance from all relevant departments and all members of society. He also said that from the perspective of the representatives who participated in the National Model Agricultural Laborers Conference, and the more than a dozen junior high and higher primary school graduates, as long as they correctly treat labor production and make achievements in labor, they will be respected and loved by the people of the whole country.

    教育部负责人谈不能升学的中小学毕业生的道路
    从事生产劳动  安心进行自学
    学龄儿童入学问题只能逐步解决，民办小学可以适当发展
    新华社15日讯  本社记者最近就今年将有较往年为多的初中和高小毕业生不能升学，有较大数量的学龄儿童不能入学的问题，访问了教育部负责人。
    教育部负责人说，中小学毕业生不可能全部升学，是个正常现象。中小学教育属于普通教育的性质，它的任务主要是提高人民文化水平，以适应社会主义建设对具有一定的政治觉悟、文化教养和健康体质的劳动后备力量的需要；另一方面也要为高等和中等学校输送一定数量的合格的新生。因此，中小学学生毕业后应当是大多数从事工农业生产劳动，而升学的只能是毕业生中的一小部分，这是理所当然的。社会主义的工农业生产，要求生产者掌握一定的文化和技术知识，为此，我们的国家愈来愈多地要求知识青年投入工农业生产劳动。事实上如果工人、农民都掌握了一定的文化，那就一定会对生产力的提高起到极大的作用。例如苏联十年制中学（相当于我国高中程度）毕业生绝大部分都是参加工农业生产。1953年莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂的技术工人有70％是十年制中学毕业生。因此，不应当认为这是不正常的现象，不应当认为中小学毕业生参加生产劳动太可惜。
    至于学龄儿童的全部入学问题，教育部负责人说，这要在今后一个较长的时期内才有可能得到解决。小学教育是国民基础教育。根据国家财政力量，只能逐步增加学龄儿童的入学比例，逐步求其解决。我国是个大国，人口增长很快，小学教育的发展在相当时期内不可能使学龄儿童全部都能入学，这也是很自然的。
    负责人说，新中国的教育事业发展是十分迅速的。1949年以来的七年多时间里，中小学的发展速度和国民党时期1931年到1946年（发展的最高年份）这十六年时间的发展速度作比较，还要快得多。1956年的中学学生五百多万人，和1946年比较，学生增加了近二倍半。小学生人数现在是六千三百多万，而1946年小学生只有二千三百多万人。
    负责人说，从建国以来，随着生产的发展，国家对教育事业的投资逐年有所增长。1956年就比1952年增长了79.9％。1956年教育经费占国家总支出7.14％，占文教卫生事业经费的支出62.62％。以国民党统治时期教育事业发展的最高年份——1946年为例，教育经费在国家总支出中，连1％都占不到。目前的小学教育的经费，几乎占教育部主管的教育事业经费的一半；中学教育的经费占到30％。国家对教育事业的投资，并不算少。中、小学教育事业的发展，如果只考虑人民群众子女的入学和升学的需要，而不考虑国家财政力量的可能，就必然要影响国家的工业建设以及其它各项建设事业，这是不符合于人民的长久的根本的利益的。
    负责人说，人民群众都希望把自己的子弟送进学校，这种愿望是可以理解的，但是，目前我国正在集中主要力量进行经济建设，教育经费不可能有大量增加。在这种情况下，根据群众的自愿和可能，适当发展民办小学，是解决部分学龄儿童入学问题的一个措施。因此，允许群众办学的方针，是必须肯定和坚持的。
    负责人说，1956年中小学毕业生升学的人数较多，主要是由于高等和中等学校招生计划偏大了一些。同时去年我国处在社会主义高潮下，各项事业都有很大的发展，需人较多，因此学校多招一些学生也是必要的。但这只是一时的特殊现象。从今年起，我们的建设事业进入正常情况，就不应当像去年那样了。同时，几年来，由于教育事业的发展太快，已经在一定程度上影响了教育质量。各级学校在去年的大发展后，在校舍、师资、设备等方面已经造成困难。为此，今后教育工作应本着正常的发展规律，在事业发展中对需要与可能兼顾，把事业放在充分可靠的基础上，在保证一定质量的原则下发展学校的数量。
    负责人说，对于不能升学的中小学毕业生来说，他们的道路就是从事工农业生产劳动。农村的不能升学的中小学毕业生，主要是从事农业劳动。像近年来参加农业生产的山东省掖县高小毕业生徐建春、山东省潍县初中肄业生胡兆坤等，他们正确地认识了生产劳动的意义，在劳动中作出了卓越的贡献，就是初中和高小毕业生的很好的榜样。其次，从我国当前工农业生产发展的情况看来，对于不能升学的中小学毕业生，国家还不可能立即使他们全部就业。这些不能升学，一时又没有参加劳动和工作条件的，就应该在家庭安心自学，为将来从事生产劳动或升学准备更好的条件。
    教育部负责人说，对于上述问题，应当在社会上进行广泛的宣传。要求家长们对子女的升学就业问题有着正确的认识和采取正确的态度。子女能升学的就让他们升学；不能升学的，家长也不要歧视他们，不要使他们为难，而是要安慰和鼓励他们，积极设法使他们去从事生产劳动，或者是根据具体情况和可能条件，帮助他们安排自学条件，让他们在家自学。
    负责人最后说，教育部最近发出了“关于指导中小学毕业生正确对待升学和就业问题的通知”。各地目前已经开始了这方面的工作。在这项工作中，希望得到各个有关部门和全体社会人士的大力支持和协助。他又说，从这次参加全国农业劳动模范代表会议的代表、十多名初中和高小毕业生来看，只要正确地对待劳动生产，在劳动中作出成绩，那么他们是会受到全国人民的尊重和爱护的。
