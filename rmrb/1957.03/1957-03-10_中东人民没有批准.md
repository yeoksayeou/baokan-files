    The People of the Middle East Have Not Approved
    On March 7th, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Senate's amended version of the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" for aggression against the Middle East. Thus, this aggression plan has been approved by both houses of the U.S. Congress, awaiting only Eisenhower's signature. Originally, the planners of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" had hoped to get congressional approval in January, but because the "Eisenhower Doctrine" has been under attack from all sides since its inception, the U.S. Congress had to delay it for two months.
    In order to ease opposition at home and abroad, Congress deliberately made some amendments to the "Eisenhower Doctrine." It changed the "authorization" for the president to use force in the Middle East at any time to "preparedness" to use armed forces if the president deems it necessary. It also changed the president's use of armed forces "in accordance with the United Nations Charter" to "in accordance with the U.S. Constitution." The final bill passed by Congress also specifically mentioned that the United States would continue to "provide facilities and military assistance" to the United Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East.
    However, these modifications did not change the colonial and aggressive nature of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the slightest. Although the saber-rattling posture seemed to be toned down a bit, the United States has not abandoned its policy of military intervention and threats against Middle Eastern countries. U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Gordon admitted that these amendments "did not undermine or affect the entire purpose of the proposal." Eisenhower himself said triumphantly at a press conference on March 7th: "I do think... Congress has approved what we are trying to do in that area..."
    What is the "entire purpose" of the "Eisenhower Doctrine"? It is to carry out a comprehensive expansion into the Middle East, suppress the national independence movements in the Middle East, seize and replace the colonial positions of Britain and France in the Middle East, so as to turn this region into an exclusive "sphere of influence" for American monopoly capitalist groups to extract maximum profits. In order to achieve this goal, the United States is now using various means to increase its military power in the Middle East to intimidate and threaten Middle Eastern countries; on the other hand, it is using the dollar as bait to win over and divide these countries. Recently, Vice Admiral Charles Brown, commander of the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean,嚣张ly said that the Sixth Fleet is the most powerful mobile force in the Mediterranean and can go anywhere to deal with any "threat." At the same time, the United States is strengthening and expanding its military bases in some countries in North Africa and the Middle East. As for the "military assistance" to the United Nations Middle East Force mentioned by the U.S. Congress, this is also a way for the United States to expand its military power in the Middle East.
    In order to promote the "Eisenhower Doctrine," the United States is also using Israel as a tool to threaten Arab countries. If Israel was a tool of Britain and France during the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, the United States has now taken over this tool and placed it under its own control. Although Israeli invading forces have been forced to withdraw from Egyptian territory, the United States still supports Israel's so-called demand for "free navigation" in the Gulf of Aqaba, attempting to turn the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba, which belong to Egypt, into an international issue, so as to maintain a stage in the Middle East where the United States can intervene at any time. All these activities that violate and threaten the sovereignty and independence of Arab countries are actually the concrete implementation of the "Eisenhower Doctrine."
    However, it is certainly not the U.S. Congress that determines the fate of the "Eisenhower Doctrine." The "Eisenhower Doctrine" has been strongly opposed by the people of all Middle Eastern countries and Asian and African countries, and its failure has long been doomed. This is something that the U.S. Congress cannot save. The Egyptian "Al-Ahram" wrote on March 8th: When Eisenhower talks about the Middle East, "it is as if he is talking about Florida or Texas." But the Middle Eastern countries are not Florida or Texas after all. The people of the Middle Eastern countries are absolutely unwilling to endure imperialist enslavement and plunder. They demand to safeguard their national sovereignty, consolidate their national independence, and step onto the international stage with an independent and autonomous posture. Although the U.S. Congress can read out various bills of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" on its podium, the people of the Middle East have not approved it. The common interest of the people of all Middle Eastern countries is: strengthen unity and resolutely oppose the "Eisenhower Doctrine"!

### 中东人民没有批准

    中东人民没有批准
    3月7日，美国国会众议院通过了参议院修改过的所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”的侵略中东计划，这样，这个侵略计划就算得到了美国国会两院的批准，只等艾森豪威尔本人签署了。本来，“艾森豪威尔主义”的策划者曾经希望在1月份就会得到国会的批准，但是由于
  “艾森豪威尔主义”从露头的那一天起就遭到四面八方的攻击，使得美国国会不得不拖延了两个月之久。
    为了缓和国内外的反对，国会最后对“艾森豪威尔主义”故意作了一些修改。它把“授权”总统可以随时在中东使用武力，改为如果总统认为必要，美国“准备”使用武装部队。它又把总统将“根据联合国宪章”使用武装部队，改为根据“美国宪法”。国会通过的最后议案还特别提到，美国将继续向联合国中东紧急部队“提供便利和军事援助”。
    但是，这些修改丝毫也没有改变“艾森豪威尔主义”的殖民侵略的实质。虽然那种磨刀霍霍的姿态似乎收敛了一下，可是美国并没有放弃它针对中东国家的武力干涉和军事威胁政策。美国众议院外交委员会主席戈登承认，这些修改“并没有破坏或是影响提案的整个目的”。艾森豪威尔本人也在3月7日的记者招待会上得意地说：“我的确认为……国会通过我们正在设法在那个地区作的事情，……”
      “艾森豪威尔主义”的“整个目的”是什么呢？这就是向中东进行全面的扩张，镇压中东的民族独立运动，夺取和代替英法在中东的殖民地位，以便把这个地区变为美国垄断资本集团榨取最大利润的独占的“势力范围”。为了达到这个目的，美国现在正一面利用各种方式增加它在中东地区的军事势力，来恫吓和威胁中东国家；一面又以美元为诱饵，对这些国家进行拉拢和分化。最近，指挥美国驻地中海舰队的查尔斯·布朗中将嚣张地说，第六舰队是地中海最强大的机动力量，它可以到任何地方去对付任何“威胁”。同时，美国正在北非和中东的某些国家加强和扩充它的军事基地。至于美国国会所说的要对联合国中东部队提供“军事援助”，这也是美国扩张它在中东军事势力的一种方式。
    为了推行“艾森豪威尔主义”，美国又把以色列作为威胁阿拉伯国家的工具。如果说在英法发动侵略埃及战争期间，以色列做了英法的工具，那么现在美国已经把这个工具接收过去，放在它自己的控制之下了。目前以色列侵略部队虽然已经被迫从埃及领土撤走，但是美国仍然支持以色列的所谓亚喀巴湾“自由通航”的要求，企图把属于埃及的加沙地带和亚喀巴湾变为国际问题，以便在中东保持一个美国可以随时进行干涉的舞台。所有这些侵犯和威胁阿拉伯国家主权和独立的活动，实际上就是“艾森豪威尔主义”的具体实施。
    但是，决定“艾森豪威尔主义”命运的当然不是美国国会。“艾森豪威尔主义”遭到了中东各国人民和亚非人民的强烈反对，早已注定了它的失败，这是美国国会所挽救不了的。3月8日埃及“金字塔报”写道：艾森豪威尔在谈到中东时“好像他是在谈到佛罗里达州或得克萨斯州”。可是中东国家毕竟不是佛罗里达或得克萨斯。中东各国人民绝对不愿意忍受帝国主义的奴役和掠夺，他们要求维护自己的国家主权，巩固自己的民族独立，并以独立自主的姿态走上国际舞台。尽管美国国会可以在它的讲坛上宣读“艾森豪威尔主义”的各种议案，但是中东人民是没有批准的。中东各国人民的共同利益是：加强团结，坚决反对“艾森豪威尔主义”！
