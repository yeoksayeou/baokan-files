Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 20th: In a memorandum issued to all countries on the 19th, the Egyptian government stated that Suez Canal tolls must be paid in advance to the Suez Canal Authority or its designated agencies.

The memorandum stated that when navigation resumes in the Suez Canal, the Egyptian government will make the following decisions:

One, Egypt remains determined to respect the letter and spirit of the Convention of Constantinople concluded in 1888;

Two, the system of collecting canal tolls remains the same, according to the last agreement between the Egyptian government and the nationalized Suez Canal Company;

Three, the issues of compensation and claims arising from nationalization can be resolved through direct agreement or arbitration;

Four, canal tolls must be paid in advance to the Egyptian Suez Canal Authority or its designated agencies;

Five, the Suez Canal Authority will establish a special fund for improvement plans or any other plans aimed at coping with the canal's increasingly frequent traffic. A certain percentage of the tolls will be allocated to establish this fund, and this percentage should not be less than the average amount allocated by the former Suez Canal Company to this fund to implement such plans;

Six, the Egyptian government will issue another detailed statement including some of the above principles. This determination of the Egyptian government proves that despite the great sacrifices it has made due to aggression, it remains faithful to the purpose of cooperating with the world's family of nations. In order to contribute to the hope of realizing peace and prosperity for mankind, the Egyptian government hopes that the canal will once again become a bond of prosperity and peace between the people of all countries.

Xinhua News Agency, March 20th: Washington dispatch: The U.S. State Department declined to comment on the Egyptian memorandum on the Suez Canal toll issue on the 19th. It is said that experts at the State Department are studying the memorandum.

On the same day, U.S. officials held informal talks with Commonwealth officials in Washington to exchange views on the Egyptian memorandum, but no immediate response was decided upon.

It is said that British officials in Washington and some people in Washington believe that this indicates that Egypt has rejected the so-called temporary solution proposed by the United States, Britain, France, and Norway regarding the Suez Canal navigation issue. This plan stipulates that half of the canal tolls should be given to Egypt and the other half should be kept in custody by the World Bank.

Xinhua News Agency, March 20th: London dispatch: A British Foreign Office spokesman said on the evening of the 19th that the Egyptian memorandum on the Suez Canal tolls and management issue was "disturbing." The spokesman also said that he could not express a final opinion on the document until the British government had received it.

British diplomatic sources said that Egypt's demands will be the first issue discussed at the Bermuda summit between the heads of government of Britain and the United States.

He believed that Egypt's publication of this memorandum showed that Egypt was "taking a strong stance" on the resolution of the canal issue.

　　埃及重申尊重“君士坦丁堡公约”
　　通知各国必须预先缴纳运河通行费
　　美国对埃及备忘录表示沉默，英国感到不安
    新华社开罗20日电　埃及政府在19日向各国发出的一项备忘录中说，必须把苏伊士运河通行费预先缴给苏伊士运河管理局或是它的指定机构。
    备忘录说，在苏伊士运河的航行恢复的时候，埃及政府作出以下的决定：
    一、埃及仍然决心尊重1888年缔结的君士坦丁堡公约的文字和精神；
    二、根据埃及政府和国有化的苏伊士运河公司之间上一次的协定，征收运河通行费的制度照旧；
    三、由于国有化而产生的赔偿和要求的问题可以通过直接的协定或通过仲裁来解决；
    四、运河通行费必须预先缴纳给埃及苏伊士运河管理局或是它的指定机构；
    五、苏伊士运河管理局将设立一笔特别基金，供改善计划或其他任何目的在于应付这条运河日益频繁的交通的计划之用。将从通行费中拨出一定比例的款项设立这笔基金，这个比例不应少于前苏伊士运河公司拨给这笔基金以实施这种计划的平均数；
    六、埃及政府将发表另一项包括上述一些原则的详尽声明。埃及政府的这种决心证明：尽管它遭到侵略而付出了巨大的牺牲，它仍然忠于同世界的国家大家庭合作的宗旨。为了对实现人类的和平和繁荣希望作出贡献，埃及政府希望这条运河再度成为世界各国人民之间的繁荣与和平的纽带。
    据新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院19日不愿对埃及关于苏伊士运河通行费问题的备忘录发表任何意见。据说，国务院的专家们正在研究这个备忘录。
    同一天，美国官员同在华盛顿的英联邦官员们举行了非正式的会谈，就埃及的备忘录交换意见，但是没有决定出一个立刻的答复。
    据说，在华盛顿的英国官员和某些华盛顿人士认为，这表示埃及拒绝了美、英、法、挪（威）四国关于苏伊士运河航行问题的所谓临时解决办法的建议。这个办法规定，运河通行费一半交给埃及，另外一半由世界银行保管。
    新华社20日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交部发言人在19日晚上说，埃及关于苏伊士运河通行费和管理问题的备忘录是“令人不安的”。发言人还说，在英国政府收到这份备忘录之前，他不能对这份文件表示最后的意见。
    英国外交人士说，埃及的要求将是英美政府首脑百慕大会谈讨论的第一个问题。
    他认为埃及发表这项备忘录，表明埃及在运河问题的解决方面“采取一种坚强的态度”。
