　　Mr. Li Shutong's Patriotic Spirit
　　Feng Zikai
　　Huang Yanpei’s article “Let Me Also Talk About Mr. Li Shutong” was published in the Wenhui Daily on March 7th. After reading it, I also wanted to "also talk about it." This year marks the fifteenth anniversary of the death of Master Hongyi (namely Mr. Li Shutong), so I will write this short article to express my commemoration.
　　In his article, Huang Yanpei pointed out Mr. Li Shutong's patriotic ideas in his youth and included a musical notation of the "Motherland Song" written by Mr. Li Shutong himself. After singing this song, I felt as if time had flowed backward, and my mood returned to my youth. I was a student of Mr. Li when he taught at Hangzhou Normal School, but before entering Hangzhou Normal School, I had already sung this "Motherland Song" in elementary school. My childhood was a period when China was increasingly beset by foreign troubles. As Mr. Huang mentioned in his article: In 1894, the Sino-Japanese War was lost to Japan; in 1895, land was ceded and indemnity was paid to Japan in peace negotiations; in 1897, Germany occupied Jiaozhou Bay; in 1898, Britain occupied Weihaiwei; in 1899, France occupied Guangzhou Bay; in 1900, the Eight-Nation Alliance occupied Beijing; in 1901, a treaty was signed to pay indemnity and negotiate peace. – My childhood was after these national humiliations. At that time, there were movements such as "Resisting American Goods," "Resisting Japanese Goods," and "Promoting the Use of National Goods" among the people. When I sang this "Motherland Song" in elementary school, it was during the period of "Promoting the Use of National Goods." When I sang "Five thousand years up and down, one line extends, no civilization can match it; tens of thousands of miles across, fertile land, enjoying natural advantages alone," the scene of my classmates and I carrying flags and marching in the streets to promote "Promoting the Use of National Goods" is vividly before my eyes. We sang songs while marching in a parade, and Mr. Li Shutong's "Motherland Song" was one of them. But at that time, I didn't know who the author of this song was.
　　Later, after graduating from elementary school, I was admitted to Hangzhou Normal School, and then I saw the author of the "Motherland Song," Mr. Li Shutong. The patriotic movement and the promotion of national products were still prevalent in Hangzhou Normal School. Our Dean of Studies, Mr. Wang Gengsan, was the most vocal in calling for it, often giving us passionate lectures, urging everyone to love and use national products and recover our rights and interests. Our music and drawing teacher, Mr. Li Shutong, was a thorough practitioner. He took off his Western clothes and wore a cloth gown: a gray monk's cloth (the cloth worn by monks) robe and a black cloth mandarin jacket. However, because he was an artist, the style of the clothes was very flattering and the colors were very harmonious, so even though he wore cloth clothes, he still had a graceful demeanor. Later, I learned that he didn't even use elastic bands because elastic bands were foreign goods at the time. After he became a monk, I once sent him some coarse cloth for monk's clothing because I saw him using hemp rope to tie his socks, and I also bought some elastic bands to send him. He accepted the coarse cloth but returned the elastic bands to me, saying, "These are foreign goods." I said, "These are domestic goods, we can already make them ourselves." Only then did he accept them. After he became a monk, he wrote to me from Wenzhou (or southern Fujian) to ask me to buy some British-made Vermilion, specifically stating in the letter: Although this is a foreign product, it is for religious culture and can be adopted. Because at that time, British watercolor paints were the best in the world and never faded. He only had to break the rule and use foreign goods for writing scriptures and Buddha names. Regarding the promotion of national goods, Mr. Wang Gengsan gave personal examples and preached everywhere; Mr. Li Shutong was silent and practiced what he preached. At that time, the patriotic atmosphere in our Hangzhou Normal School was very strong, precisely because of these two gentlemen. Mr. Wang Gengsan is still alive in Shanghai and will surely be able to recall the situation at that time.
　　Mr. Li Shutong at the age of thirty-nine – this was during the period when the European War broke out, Japan proposed the Twenty-One Demands, Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor, the Guangdong-Guangxi War, the Hunan-Hubei War, and the Zhili-Fengtian War, when the country was in a chaotic state – resigned from his teaching position, entered the Buddhist gate, and became Master Hongyi. On the eve of Master Hongyi's ordination, he sent me a handwritten scroll of his own poems and lyrics, including a JinlÜ Qu, entitled "Going to Japan, Farewell to the Motherland, and Presented to My Fellow Students." The full text is as follows:
　　With disheveled hair, I feign madness and run. In the vast Central Plains, crows croak through a few withered willows at dusk. Who will clean up the shattered rivers and mountains? The desolate west wind remains the same. It provokes the sadness of those who part. I am about to go, sighing heavily by the flowing water, speaking of longing, carving deeply twin red beans. Sorrow is dim, thicker than wine. The flow of the Songbo River never ceases. I hate the catkins and duckweed drifting year after year, making it difficult to look back. Twenty articles astonished the world, but after all, what is empty talk! Listen to the mad roar of the azure dragon in the box. I cannot sleep on a long night in the west wind. How can I begrudge dissecting my heart and liver to save all living beings! It is the motherland, bearing to let down!
　　I still remember when he unfolded this hand scroll to show me, he specially pointed to this Ci and said to me with a smile: "When I wrote this Ci, it was exactly your age." At that time, I was young and ignorant and remained indifferent. Looking back now, this implies that in the cold heart of Mr. Li Shutong, who was forced to enter the Buddhist gate by the bad environment, a spark of patriotic enthusiasm had never been extinguished!
　　In terms of art, Mr. Li Shutong was the earliest person in China to promote spoken drama, the earliest person to study oil painting, and the earliest person to study Western music. Last year, when our country commemorated the Japanese monk Sesshū, I often thought that in art, our country's Master Hongyi and Japan's monk Sesshū were very similar. Monk Sesshū studied in China and introduced Chinese Song and Yuan ink painting techniques to Japan; Master Hongyi studied in Japan and introduced modern spoken drama, oil painting, and piano music to China. Master Hongyi's contribution to China's art world is really no less than Monk Sesshū's contribution to Japan's art world! Monk Sesshū has many memorial constructions in Japan. I hope China also has a memorial construction for Master Hongyi. Master Hongyi's works and memorabilia are now scattered in the private homes of his many friends. People often write to me asking if there is a memorial hall to send them to. Mr. Du Shenfu, an old gentleman in Hangzhou, is one of them. This year is the fifteenth anniversary of Master Hongyi's death and the fiftieth anniversary of the spoken drama he pioneered. I hope that in Hangzhou, where Master Hongyi lived the longest and became a monk locally, there will be a memorial hall that can permanently preserve documents about him and permanently commemorate this patriotic artist monk.

### 李叔同先生的爱国精神

专栏：

　　李叔同先生的爱国精神
　　丰子恺
    3月7日的文汇报上载着黄炎培先生的一篇文章“我也来谈谈李叔同先生”。我读了之后，也想“也来谈谈”。今年正是弘一法师（即李叔同先生）逝世十五周年，我就写这篇小文来表示纪念吧。
    黄炎培先生这篇文章里指出李叔同先生青年时代的爱国思想，并且附刊李叔同先生亲笔的自撰的“祖国歌”的图谱。我把这歌唱了一遍，似觉年光倒流，心情回复了少年时代。我是李先生任教杭州师范时的学生，但在没有进杭州师范的时候，早已在小学里唱过这“祖国歌”。我的少年时代，正是中国外患日逼的时期。如黄先生文中所说：1894年甲午之战败于日本，1895年割地赔款与日本讲和，1897年德占胶州湾，1898年英占威海卫，1899年法占广州湾，1900年八国联军占北京，1901年订约赔款讲和。——我的少年时代正在这些国耻之后。那时民间曾经有“抵制美货、”“抵制日货”、“劝用国货”等运动。我在小学里唱到这“祖国歌”的时候，正是“劝用国货”的时期。我唱到“上下数千年，一脉延，文明莫与肩；纵横数万里，膏腴地，独享天然利”的时候，和同学们肩了旗子排队到街上去宣传“劝用国货”时的情景，憬然在目。我们排队游行时唱着歌，李叔同先生的“祖国歌”正是其中之一。但当时我不知道这歌的作者是谁。
    后来我小学毕业，考进了杭州师范，方才看见“祖国歌”的作者李叔同先生。爱国运动，劝用国货宣传，依旧盛行在杭州师范中。我们的教务长王更三先生是号召最力的人，常常对我们作慷慨激昂的训话，劝大家爱用国货，挽回利权。我们的音乐图画教师李叔同先生是彻底实行的人，他脱下了洋装，穿一身布衣：灰色云章布（就是和尚们穿的布）袍子，黑布马褂。然而因为他是美术家，衣服的形式很称身，色彩很调和，所以虽然布衣草裳，还是风度翩然。后来我知道他连宽紧带也不用，因为当时宽紧带是外国货。他出家后有一次我送他些僧装用的粗布，因为看见他用麻绳束袜子，又买了些宽紧带送他。他受了粗布，把宽紧带退还我，说：“这是外国货。”我说：“这是国货，我们已经能够自造。”他这才受了。他出家后，又有一次从温州（或闽南）写信给我，要我替他买些英国制的朱砂（Vermilion），信上特别说明：此虽洋货，但为宗教文化，不妨采用。因为当时英国水彩颜料在全世界为最佳，永不退色。他只有为了写经文佛号，才不得不破例用外国货。关于劝用国货，王更三先生现身说法，到处宣讲；李叔同先生则默默无言，身体力行。当时我们杭州师范里的爱国空气很浓重，正为了有这两位先生的缘故。王更三先生现在健在上海，一定能够回味当时的情况。
    李叔同先生三十九岁上——这正是欧洲大战发生，日本提出二十一条，袁世凯称帝，粤桂战争，湘鄂战争，奉直战争，国内乌烟瘴气的期间——辞去教职，遁入空门，就变成了弘一法师。弘一法师剃度前夕送我一个亲笔的自撰的诗词手卷，其中有一首金缕曲，题目是“将之日本，留别祖国，并呈同学诸子”。全文如下：
    披发佯狂走。莽中原暮鸦啼彻几株衰柳。破碎河山谁收拾，零落西风依旧。便惹得离人消瘦。行矣临流重太息，说相思刻骨双红豆。愁黯黯，浓于酒。漾情不断淞波溜。恨年年絮飘萍泊，遮难回首。二十文章惊海内，毕竟空谈何有！听匣底苍龙狂吼。长夜西风眠不得，度群生那惜心肝剖！是祖国，忍孤负！
　　我还记得他展开这手卷来给我看的时候，特别指着这阕词，笑着对我说：“我作这阕词的时候，正是你的年纪。”当时我年幼无知，漠然无动于衷。现在回想，这暗示着：被恶劣的环境所迫而遁入空门的李叔同先生的冷寂的心的底奥里，一点爱国热忱的星火始终没有熄灭！
    在文艺方面说，李叔同先生是中国最早提倡话剧的人，最早研究油画的人，最早研究西洋音乐的人。去年我国纪念日本的雪舟法师的时候，我常常想起：在文艺上，我国的弘一法师和日本的雪舟法师非常相似。雪舟法师留学中国，把中国的宋元水墨画法输入日本；弘一法师留学日本，把现代的话剧、油画和钢琴音乐输入中国。弘一法师对中国文艺界的贡献，实在不亚于雪舟法师对日本文艺界的贡献！雪舟法师在日本有许多纪念建设。我希望中国也有弘一法师的纪念建设。弘一法师的作品、纪念物，现在分散在他的许多朋友的私人家里，常常有人来信问我有没有纪念馆可以交送，杭州的堵申甫老先生便是其一。今年是弘一法师逝世十五周年纪念，又是他所首倡的话剧五十周年纪念。我希望在弘一法师住居最久而就地出家的杭州，有一个纪念馆，可以永久保存关于他的文献，可以永久纪念这位爱国艺僧。
    1957年3月12日于上海作。
