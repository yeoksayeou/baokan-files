    苏联地方苏维埃选举充满高度政治热情
    莫斯科几乎全市选民投了票
    新华社4日讯  据塔斯社报道：来自俄罗斯联邦等八个加盟共和国的消息表明，苏联人民非常踊跃地参加了各级地方苏维埃的选举。
    到3日下午六点钟，莫斯科市投票的人数占全市选民99.5％。在3日中午十二时，列宁格勒就有90％的选民投了票；斯大林格勒的投票选民达到了90％以上，斯维德洛夫斯克、下塔吉尔等地达到了80％以上。
    在3日这一天举行选举的有俄罗斯联邦、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、乌兹别克、立陶宛、摩尔达维亚、塔吉克和土库曼共和国。其他一些加盟共和国的选举将先后在下两个星期日举行。
    最先开始投票的是俄罗斯联邦东部地区的居民。当西部地区还是3月2日晚上的时候，远东已经是星期天了。在楚克奇半岛，斯大林集体农庄的选民在清晨就来到选举站履行自己的公民权利。
    此外，在基辅、明斯克、阿尔泰边疆区、顿巴斯及其他许多地方，城乡劳动人民投票的情况也非常热烈。正在远东航行的苏联舰队向敖德萨发出无线电报说，苏联海员同祖国全体公民一起参加了选举。
    苏联科学家在遥远的南极建立的科学基地——和平村，是属于莫斯科市的第三十八号选举站。从那里发来的电报报告说，投票已经如期完成。
