    I fully endorse and agree with the report made by Premier Zhou to the conference and the work report of the Standing Committee.
    Now, allow me to offer some opinions on how engineering and technical personnel in enterprises can advance towards modern science and technology. Since the Party Central Committee convened the conference on intellectuals last year, Party and government organs in various regions have strengthened their leadership over intellectuals and adopted some measures. Consequently, engineering and technical personnel, like other intellectuals, have made significant improvements in their political and ideological awareness and in their scientific and technical expertise over the past year.
    According to the decisions of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party regarding the conference on intellectuals, Anshan Iron and Steel Company is currently carrying out and preparing to carry out the following main tasks for engineering and technical personnel to advance towards science and technology:
    I. To organize engineering and technical personnel to learn from Soviet experts in Anshan Iron and Steel Company in a planned manner: Firstly, to compile and publish the valuable suggestions made by Soviet experts in construction and production over the past few years into a book, and organize engineering and technical personnel to study it; Secondly, to invite Soviet experts to give regular reports introducing the latest achievements in Soviet science and technology; Thirdly, to send people to the Soviet Union to study as needed. In addition, we will establish close contact with domestic scientific research institutions to strive to quickly learn the new scientific achievements of the world and the results of their research.
    II. To organize engineering and technical personnel to engage in in-service training in a led and planned manner: Firstly, to organize and mobilize engineering and technical personnel who graduated from secondary technical schools or have not fully graduated from university to enroll in Anshan Iron and Steel Company's night university for professional studies in batches year by year (currently there are more than 1,000 people); Secondly, for engineering and technical personnel who graduated from university before the change of the university system in 1953, to carry out spare-time supplementary professional theory based on the principle of "what is lacking, make up for it" (employing professors from schools and correspondence stations), striving to complete this task by 1958; Thirdly, to organize professional technical lectures, academic report meetings, and enrich technical research associations; In addition, according to the needs of production and construction, it is planned to organize senior technical personnel to conduct special research, formulate research plans, and invite Soviet experts to guide; For general staff who have done technical work for a considerable period but do not have a technical title, encourage and help them to study technical theory diligently, and after passing the examination to reach the level of graduation from secondary technical schools, they can obtain the title of technician.
    III. In order to create conditions for engineering and technical personnel to advance towards science and technology, the technical library has been appropriately enriched, assistants and necessary equipment have been increased, and the learning of Russian and other foreign languages has been expanded in a planned manner.
    In short, although all activities in enterprises to advance towards science and technology are diverse, they must be closely linked to reality and serve production; use practice to enrich theory, and further improve production under the guidance of theory. We believe that this should be a firm and unwavering policy.
    In carrying out these tasks, we still have many shortcomings and problems. In terms of leadership: the supervision, inspection and assistance of the personal plans of engineering and technical personnel is not enough. Night universities, books and magazines, and research tools cannot yet meet everyone's needs. The time for special research has not yet been included in the work plan, so it is difficult to get full guarantees. The leadership and education of engineering and technical personnel in improving their ideological understanding of their work in advancing towards science and technology is not sufficient. In terms of the engineering and technical personnel themselves, some are too busy all day long due to poor working methods and are not good at using time for self-study; some excessively emphasize objective environmental difficulties and are not at ease with learning, so the academic atmosphere is not strong and learning habits have not yet been formed; some are overly ambitious, divorced from production reality, and pursue higher theories, resulting in the failure of their plans.
    All of the above shortcomings and problems need to be further resolved and improved. We believe that under the leadership of the Party and with the help of Soviet experts, through the intense labor of all engineering and technical personnel of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, our team will certainly be able to continue to expand, and our scientific and technical and business work will certainly be able to continue to improve. Anshan Iron and Steel Company's national plan and the task of training talents to support other new steel bases will certainly be completed! (Attached picture)

    企业技术人员怎样向科学进军
    杨树棠介绍鞍山钢铁公司的作法
    我完全拥护和同意周总理向大会所作的报告和常委会的工作报告。
    现在请允许我就企业内工程技术人员向现代科学技术进军发表些意见。自从去年党中央召开知识分子会议以后，各地党政机关对知识分子加强了领导并采取了一些措施，因此一年来工程技术人员同其他知识分子一样，在政治思想觉悟上和在科学技术业务上都有了显著的提高。
    鞍山钢铁公司根据中共鞍山市委关于知识分子会议的决定，对工程技术人员向科学技术进军，现在正在进行和准备进行着以下几项主要工作：
    一、有计划地组织工程技术人员向在鞍钢的苏联专家学习：首先把几年来苏联专家在建设和生产中的宝贵建议，经过整理汇编成书，组织工程技术人员学习；其次定期邀请苏联专家作报告，介绍苏联科学技术上的最新的成就；再次按照需要派人去苏联学习。此外还与国内科学研究机关取得密切联系，争取迅速地学习世界上新的科学成就和它们研究的成果。
    二、有领导有计划地组织工程技术人员进行在职进修：首先组织动员中等技术学校毕业或未满大学毕业程度的工程技术人员，逐年分批入鞍钢夜大学专业学习（现有一千余人）；其次对在1953年大学改变学制以前毕业的工程技术人员根据“缺什么，补什么”的原则，进行业余补习专业理论（聘请学校教授及函授站的办法），争取在1958年内完成这项任务；再次组织专业技术讲座、学术报告会和充实技术研究会等；此外，根据生产和建设的需要拟组织高级技术人员进行专题研究，制定研究计划并请苏联专家指导；对于已经做过相当时期的技术性的工作而无技术职称的一般职员，鼓励帮助他们努力学技术理论，经过考试达到中等技术学校毕业的水平，可取得技术员的职称。
    三、为了给工程技术人员向科学技术进军创造条件，适当地充实了技术图书馆，增加了工作助手和必要的设备等，并有计划地扩大了俄文和其他外文的学习。
    总之，在企业内向科学技术进军的一切活动，虽然是多种多样的，但必须密切联系实际，为生产服务；用实践来丰富理论，在理论指导下，进一步提高生产。我们认为这应该是坚定不移的方针。
    在进行这些工作当中，我们还存在着许多缺点和问题。在领导方面是：对工程技术人员的个人规划的督促检查和帮助不够。夜大学和图书杂志以及研究工具等还不能满足大家的要求。专题研究的时间还未列入工作计划因而很难得到充分的保证。对于工程技术人员向科学技术进军为了提高工作的思想认识的领导和教育不够。在工程技术人员本身方面，有的由于工作方法不好，终日忙碌，不善于利用时间进行自修；有的过分强调客观环境困难，不安心学习，因此，学术风气不浓，学习习惯尚未养成；有的好高骛远脱离生产实际，追求较高的理论，以致规划落空。
    所有上述这些缺点和问题都有待于进一步解决和改进。我们相信，在党的领导下，在苏联专家的帮助下，通过鞍钢全体工程技术人员的紧张的劳动，我们的队伍一定能够不断的扩大，我们的科学技术和业务工作的水平一定能够不断的提高。鞍钢的国家计划和为支援其他新的钢铁基地培养人材的任务一定能够完成！（附图片）
