We would like to offer some suggestions on advocating thrift and savings among the people nationwide.

The Party and the government, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "advocate a style of hard work and plain living, share weal and woe with the masses, and oppose extravagance and waste," have launched a nationwide movement to increase production and practice economy. We all know that the movement to increase production and practice economy aims to increase production, improve quality, reduce costs, accelerate capital turnover, and save raw materials in production. In terms of livelihood, it requires thrift and savings, which is also an important aspect of the movement to increase production and practice economy.

Our country's socialist construction requires a large amount of capital. The main source of capital is internal accumulation by the people. Mass social savings are an important source of internal accumulation. According to our understanding, the total savings deposits in the People's Bank of China nationwide amounted to 2253.83 million yuan by the end of February this year. This amount is equivalent to 9.95% of the total industrial investment during the first four years of our country's first Five-Year Plan. Therefore, savings play a huge role in accumulating construction funds.

Another important role of advocating thrift and savings among the people is to further stabilize market prices. As Vice Premier Chen Yun pointed out at the meeting on the 9th, the current living standards in our country are still very low compared to economically developed countries, and many consumer goods are not yet available in sufficient supply. Therefore, in order to stabilize the market, people across the country should economize on consumption and channel this portion of their purchasing power into savings. This will play a significant role in stabilizing the market. We have recently seen from the newspapers that the tight market situation in Beijing has greatly eased. The consumption of cotton cloth has decreased by 20%, and the consumption of high-end goods has dropped significantly. Woolen fabrics, silks, watches, etc., have all decreased. However, the savings deposits in the People's Bank of China in Beijing increased by 5.35 million yuan in February alone. This shows that the education on hard work and plain living has gradually taken root in people's hearts, and participating in savings has become a trend, which is an excellent phenomenon.

Savings are not only beneficial to the country but also to the people themselves. Regular participation in savings can cultivate frugal habits. Putting the surplus money into the bank can accumulate a large sum over time, which can be used for emergencies or to improve one's own life. Putting daily money into the bank can prevent reckless spending, reasonably arrange life, and avoid falling into debt. Therefore, the benefit of savings lies in the close combination of national interests and individual interests. The state explicitly protects citizens' savings under Article 14 of the Constitution in order to encourage people to save. The People's Bank of China pays out approximately over 100 million yuan in interest each year. Under the encouragement of the state, people's savings have greatly developed over the years. If the total savings deposits nationwide in 1952 are taken as 100, then the figure for 1953 is 143, for 1954 it is 167, for 1955 it is 201, and for 1956 it is 265.

Our country is vast and rich in resources with a large population. If everyone saves a little, it will accumulate into a large amount, and participating in savings is a good thing that benefits both the country and the individual. However, some people still do not fully understand the significance of savings, and some do not know how to economize in their lives. For example, we learned that the administrative advances of the employees of the five bureaus of industry, electrical machinery, building materials, public utilities, and textiles, and the four major cotton mills in Wuhan City, amounted to over 439,000 yuan in the first half of last year. While some of these advances were due to the employees' financial difficulties, a considerable portion was caused by personal extravagance and waste. This not only affected the employees' own lives but also brought many problems to the welfare work of the organizations. All of this shows the necessity of establishing a style of hard work and plain living and advocating savings.

After the national wage reform last year, people had more money in their hands. According to the National Bureau of Statistics' survey of the income and expenditure of approximately 6,000 industrial worker families in 27 large and medium-sized cities, the amount of money in the hands of residents in the third quarter of 1956 increased by 88.48% compared to the second quarter. This shows that the potential for people to participate in savings has not been well tapped. On the one hand, people's saving habits have not been widely established, and on the other hand, the savings departments of the People's Bank of China have not done a good job in carrying out extensive publicity work. The deposit and withdrawal procedures are also not convenient enough. In terms of institutional settings, there are too many banks in some places and too few banks in others, especially in the suburbs and newly built areas of cities, where bank branches are even less common. These are all urgent issues to be improved.

In order to establish the habit of saving among the broad masses of the people, we believe that the call and cooperation of all parties are needed. To ensure that people know about saving from an early age, relying solely on the work of the bank is far from enough. To this end, we suggest:

1. We hope that all political parties, organizations, enterprises, factories and mines, and people's organizations will jointly call for promoting people's thrift and savings as one of the contents of socialist education, educating people to reasonably arrange their lives, participate in savings, and cultivate a style of hard work and plain living. At the same time, this will also solve some of the problems that arise in the welfare of organizations and enterprises.

2. In order to facilitate the savings of the broad masses of the people, we hope that all organizations and groups, under the principle of streamlining, will appropriately assist banks in establishing agency offices in organizations and units to facilitate employees' deposits and withdrawals.

3. The People's Bank of China should further strengthen savings work, widely publicize, facilitate deposits and withdrawals, actively develop business, adhere to the principle of voluntarism, and prevent coercive orders.

Whether the above opinions are appropriate or not, we hope you will correct them. (Attached picture)

### 在全国人民中提倡节约和储蓄　资耀华　吴晋航　米暂沉的联合发言

　　在全国人民中提倡节约和储蓄
　　资耀华　吴晋航　米暂沉的联合发言
    我们就在全国人民中间提倡节约和储蓄，表示一些意见。
    党和政府根据毛主席的指示“提倡艰苦朴素的作风，与群众同甘共苦，反对铺张浪费的现象。”在全国范围内展开了增产节约运动。我们都知道增产节约运动在生产上是要增加生产，提高质量，降低成本，加速资金周转，节约原材料等等，在生活上就要节约和储蓄，这也是增产节约运动的一个重要内容。
    我们国家社会主义建设，需要大量的资金，资金来源主要是依靠人民内部的积累，群众性的社会储蓄，是内部积累的一个重要来源，据我们了解，全国人民银行储蓄存款至今年2月底共二十二万五千三百八十三万元，这笔数目，相等于我国第一个五年计划头四年内的工业投资总额的9.95％，所以储蓄对积累建设资金的作用是非常巨大的。
    在人民中间提倡节约和储蓄的另一个重要作用，是可以进一步稳定市场物价，正如陈云副总理在9日会上的发言中所指出，我国目前生活水平比起经济发达的国家还是很差的，许多消费品在目前还供应不上，因此，为了稳定市场，全国人民节约消费，把这一部分购买力参加到储蓄中去，对稳定市场就会起很大的作用，我们最近从报上可以看到北京市的市场紧张情况，已经大为和缓，棉布的消费量已减少了20％，高级商品消费量下降很多，呢绒、绸缎、手表等都下降了，而北京市人民银行的储蓄存款在2月份一个月却增加了五百三十五万元。这说明艰苦朴素的教育已经逐渐深入人心，参加储蓄已经蔚成风气，这是极好的现象。
    储蓄不但对国家有好处，对于人们本身也有好处，经常参加储蓄，可以养成俭朴的习惯，把平时用之有余的钱存到银行去，积少成多，可以备万一之用，也可以用来改善自己的生活，把日常待用的钱存到银行去，可以防止胡乱花费，合理安排生活，也免得拉亏空。所以，储蓄的好处正在于体现了国家利益和个人利益的密切结合，国家为了鼓励人民储蓄，宪法第十四条明确规定保护公民储蓄，人民银行每年付出约一亿余元的利息，在国家的鼓励下，人民储蓄历年来均有很大发展，如以1952年全国储蓄存款总数为一百，则1953年为一百四十三，1954年为一百六十七，1955年为二百零一，1956年为二百六十五。
    我国地大物博，人口众多，每人节约一点，聚沙成塔，积腋成裘，积起来就是大数，参加储蓄更是功在国家利在自己的好事。但目前还有些人对储蓄的意义不大了解，有些人生活上还不知道节约，比如我们了解到武汉市去年上半年工业、机电、建筑材料、公用事业、纺织五个局及四大纱厂职工的行政借支竟达四十三万九千余元，其中固然有一部分是因为职工生活困难而借支的，但也有相当大的一部分是由于个人生活铺张浪费所造成的后果，不但职工本身生活上发生影响，而且对机关的福利工作也带来许多问题，这些都说明树立艰苦朴素的作风和提倡储蓄的必要。
    去年全国工资改革以后，人民手中的钱增多了，据国家统计局对二十七个大中城市六千户左右工业职工家庭收支统计，1956年第三季度居民手中的钱比第二季度要增加88.48％，这就说明人民参加储蓄的潜力还没有很好地挖掘，这一方面是人们的储蓄习惯未普遍建立，一方面还因为人民银行的储蓄部门还没有很好地广泛开展宣传工作，在存取手续上也不够方便，机构设置上，有的地方银行多了，有的地方银行少了，特别是在城市的郊区和新建区，银行的机构更不普遍，这些都是急待改进的。
    为了在广大人民群众中树立储蓄的习惯，我们认为需要各方面的号召配合，要做到人民从小就知道储蓄，单纯依靠银行的工作是远远不够的。为此，我们建议：
    1．希望各党派、各机关、企业、厂矿、人民团体共同号召，把推动人们节约和储蓄作为社会主义教育的内容之一，教育人们合理安排生活，参加储蓄，培养人们艰苦朴素作风。同时，也解决了机关企业的一部分福利上所发生的一些问题。
    2．为了便利广大人民储蓄，希望各机关、团体在精简的原则下，适当协助银行设立机关单位里的代办所，以便利职工存取。
    3．人民银行要进一步加强储蓄工作，广泛宣传，便利存取，积极开展业务，坚持自愿原则，防止强迫命令现象。
    以上的意见，是否妥当，希望各位指正。（附图片）
