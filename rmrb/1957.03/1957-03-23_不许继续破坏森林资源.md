　　No Further Destruction of Forest Resources Allowed
    We must protect forest resources
    Serious destruction of forest resources has occurred in many areas of Heilongjiang Province. In January and February of this year, the 8502 Farm in Baoqing County completely cut down 150 hectares of broad-leaved forest for construction purposes, even digging up the roots. This farm also shaved clean six forest farms, including Siheying, which the state had already planned to set up as forest management stations. The state-owned Jinsha Farm in the Boli area also destroyed nearly 200 hectares of forest, damaging many trees and saplings. Since the Spring Festival, in Mulan County, the County Party Secretary and the County Head personally led the masses in massively felling trees in forest areas such as Sanmen Xujia and Huoshaoyingzi, leaving stumps over one meter high, resulting in serious waste. Even more seriously, in Baihe Township, Xunke County, Heihe area, Baihe Village cut down broad-leaved saplings for firewood, destroying the state's sapling resources. Shidiyingzi Agricultural Cooperative cut down more than 6,000 state-owned trees, and Kaoshan Village cut down 2,000 oak and birch saplings. The Erlongshan Farm felled more than 25,000 poplar and oak trees, two meters tall and three to four years old, in a sapling forest called Xiaogushan.
    Why is this widespread destruction of forest resources happening? On the one hand, some people genuinely do not understand the scarcity of national forest resources, so they see that there are many forests and trees around them, and they think that there are so many forests that it doesn't matter if they cut down a little for their own use; on the other hand, some people know the value of national forest resources but still destroy them at will. Party and government leading organs at all levels in Heilongjiang Province should pay attention to this bad phenomenon, organize farm management, forestry, and supervision departments to conduct inspections at any time, and deal with it promptly to prevent this phenomenon from happening.　He Chongyun
  The Evil Consequences of Blindly Purchasing Timber
    In recent months, the phenomenon of indiscriminate felling of trees and wasting timber has been widespread in various parts of Jiangxi Province, causing great losses to national forest resources. According to reports, areas where indiscriminate felling and waste of timber are particularly serious include 18 counties such as Zixi, Poyang, Pingxiang, Yiyang, and Fenyi. Some areas, regardless of the type of tree, whether it is good or bad, or the size of the timber, cut down many materials that could be used for infrastructure construction and sleepers and pit props into kiln firewood and charcoal; some areas, regardless of the amount of forest reserves, disregarding soil and water conservation and long-term interests, shaved the entire mountain, the entire commune, and the entire township of forests "bald"; some even cut down oil tea forests, young forests, and mother bamboo completely.
    There are many reasons for indiscriminate felling, and blind purchase is one of them. At present, the management of timber operations is very chaotic, with multiple operating units, inflated planned tasks, and excessive concentration of felling.
    Since the opening of the Yingxia Railway, Zixi County has had merchants from nine provinces concentrated at the county's two intermediate stations to purchase large quantities of bamboo, wood, firewood, and charcoal. More than 3,000 workers from other provinces and counties are concentrated in the Yaoqiao area of the county, specializing in felling trees, sawing planks, and burning charcoal. According to statistics, the most number of charcoal kilns developed to more than 120, and the forests near the charcoal kilns, except for bamboo and individual large cedar trees, were all cut down.
    Supply and marketing cooperatives assign the task of purchasing thatch bamboo mostly concentrated in areas with convenient transportation. For example, the annual felling volume of thatch bamboo in Yichun County is at most 600,000, while the supply and marketing cooperative assigned the county 1.2 million; Pingxiang fells 600,000 thatch bamboo annually, but the supply and marketing cooperative assigned 2.3 million. From this year's Jiangxi Province thatch bamboo purchase plan, this bias can also be seen. For example, the bamboo forest reserves in Ji'an and Southern Jiangxi are relatively large, but the number of task allocations only accounts for 17.7% of the total; Nanchang, Fuzhou, and Shangrao three special zones have fewer bamboo forest resources, but are assigned a purchase volume accounting for 78.4% of the total task.　Jiang Lin

  Cultivating Wasteland on Steep Slopes is Not Advised
    During our official business trip, while passing through the border between Yunan and Deqing counties in Guangdong Province by boat, we discovered a turbid tributary entering the Xijiang River, which is the Nanjiang River flowing from Luoding, Yunfu, Yunan and other counties. During our work in this area, we saw people reclaiming wasteland on the slopes every day, and many of the mountains near the villages had become red mountain tops. It is understood that there is little land in this area, and historically they relied on income from mountain forest side occupations. However, during the Japanese puppet era and the Kuomintang rule, the mountain forests were destroyed, and the existing residual forests are not enough to maintain life. In addition to last year's flood, the government called for the development of side occupations. The only way is to enter the mountains to cut down young trees (large trees have been cut down) to sell firewood, burn charcoal, and cultivate wasteland to grow cassava, and some even reclaim land on steep slopes of 35 to 40 degrees. This has resulted in soil erosion.
    What is particularly serious is that individual farmers have to refine the mountains (burn weeds and shrubs) when reclaiming land, and never open firebreaks, which often causes forest fires due to burning reclamation. In Yunan County in 1956, fires caused by burning reclamation burned more than 3,000 mu of forest.
    We suggest that the local party and government leading organs should, through the production planning of cooperatives, systematically stop the destruction of forests and reclaim wasteland, and protect the existing forests well. For areas with steep slopes suitable for afforestation, the masses can be mobilized to plant trees. On gentle slopes, agroforestry methods can also be used for afforestation to increase grain production; intercropping of taro, cassava, and economically valuable indigo in the forest can also increase income. Reclaiming steep slopes should be stopped as soon as possible to maintain soil and water, regulate rainfall and climate, and promote increased agricultural production.　　　　　Zhang Jing, Guo Lianqing

### 不许继续破坏森林资源

　　不许继续破坏森林资源
    要爱护森林资源
    黑龙江省许多地区发生了严重的破坏森林资源的现象。在今年1、2月间，宝清县的八五零二农场因建场即将一百五十公顷阔叶林全部砍光，连同树根都刨了出来。这个农场还把国家已经规划设置森林经营所的四合营等六处林场剃了光头。勃利地区的国营金沙农场也破坏了近二百公顷森林，将许多的树木和幼树都毁坏了。木兰县自春节以来由中共县委书记和县长亲自领导群众在三门徐家、火烧营子等森林地带大肆砍伐树木，伐根高达一公尺以上，造成严重浪费。更严重的是黑河地区逊克县百合乡百合村砍伐阔叶幼树当烧柴，毁坏国家幼林资源。史地营子农业社砍毁国家树木六千余棵，靠山村砍了两千棵柞、桦幼树。二龙山农场在一个名叫小孤山的幼林中砍伐两公尺多高三、四年生的杨、柞树达两万五千多棵。
    为什么会发生这样普遍破坏森林资源的现象呢？一方面是某些人真正不了解国家森林资源的贫乏，所以他们看到了自己生活的周围多的是森林和树木，就自以为森林那么多，砍上点用不妨事；另外一种人是明知国家森林资源的宝贵而却随意毁坏。黑龙江省的各级党、政领导机关对这种不良现象应重视起来，组织农场管理、林业、监察等部门随时进行检查，及时处理，以杜绝这种现象。　赫重运
  盲目收购木材的恶果
    近几个月以来，江西省各地普遍发生滥伐林木和浪费木材的现象，使国家森林资源受到重大损失。据反映，滥伐和浪费林木特别严重的地区有资溪、鄱阳、萍乡、弋阳、分宜等十八个县。有些地区不分树种好坏、不论林木大小，把许多可作基建和枕、坑木的用材都砍成窑柴、薪炭柴；有的地区不管森林蓄积量多少，不顾水土保持和长远利益，将整山、整社、整乡的森林剃了“光头”；有的甚至连油茶林、幼林、母竹都被砍伐殆尽。
    滥伐的原因很多，盲目收购也是其中的一个。当前木材经营管理工作很混乱，经营单位多头，计划任务膨胀，砍伐过分集中。
    资溪县自鹰厦铁路通车后，有九个省的客商集中于该县两个中途站大量收购竹木柴炭，三千多名外省外县工人，集中在该县尧桥片专门从事伐木、锯板和烧木炭。据统计炭窑最多的时期曾发展到一百二十多座，炭窑附近的森林，除竹子和个别的大杉树以外全被砍光。
    供销社布置收购茅竹任务大部分集中于交通方便的地区。如宜春县茅竹年采伐量最多六十万根，而供销社布置了该县一百二十万根；萍乡茅竹年采伐六十万根，供销社却布置了二百三十万根。从今年江西省茅竹收购计划也可以看出这个偏向，如吉安、赣南两地竹林蓄积量较多，而任务分配数仅占总数的17.7％；南昌、抚州、上饶三个专区竹林资源较少，却分配了占总任务78.4％的收购数。　蒋遴
  不应该在陡坡上开荒
    我们因公出差，乘船经过广东省郁南、德庆县界时，发现一股混浊支流进入西江，这就是从罗定、云浮、郁南等县境内流出的南江。我们在这一带工作期间，每日都看到群众在山坡上开垦荒地，靠近村边的山已多变成红山头。据了解，这一带土地少，历史上依靠山林副业收入，但在日伪时代和国民党统治时期，山林破坏殆尽，现有残林不足以维持生活，再加去年水灾，政府号召发展副业生产，唯一办法是入山采伐幼树（大树已砍光）卖柴、烧木炭和垦荒种木薯，有的竟在三十五至四十度的陡坡上开垦。这样便造成了水土流失。
    特别严重的是个体农民，在开垦时要炼山（烧杂草和灌木），从来不开防火线，常常因烧垦引起山林火灾，郁南县1956年由于烧垦引起火灾即烧毁森林三千多亩。
    我们建议当地党政领导机关应该通过合作社的生产规划，有计划地制止毁林开荒，对现有森林很好地保护。对陡坡适宜造林的地区，可发动群众造林，在缓坡为增产粮食也可以采用农林间作的方法造林；在林中间种茨莨、木薯和有经济价值的蓝靛等，也同样可以增加收入。应该从速制止陡坡开荒，做到保持水土调节雨量气候，促进农业增产。　　　　　张靖、郭连庆
