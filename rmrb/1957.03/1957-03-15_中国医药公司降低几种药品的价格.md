    中国医药公司降低几种药品的价格
    本报讯  中国医药公司为了配合消灭地方病和减轻病患者的负担，在扩大生产、降低成本的基础上，最近经商业部批准，决定将几种医治危害人民健康严重的地方病的药品售价降低。降低的幅度是，最低的7.7％，最高的46％。如治疗血吸虫病的“海群生”，每一百片（五十公丝）的售价由十一元降低到七元；治疗蛔虫病、钩虫病的“土荆芥油”，每磅的售价由六十五元调为六十元；治疗麻疯病的“苯丙砜片”，每一百片（零点五公分）由四元六角九分调为二元五角；“氨苯砜”每千片（零点零五公分）由十二元调为八元二角。中国医药公司已通知产地（或口岸）销售单位，从3月10日起执行。据初步计算，由于价格的调低，将减轻病患者负担一百五十余万元。
