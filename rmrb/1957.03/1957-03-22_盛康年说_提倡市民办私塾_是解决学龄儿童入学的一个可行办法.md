　　I completely agree with Chairman Zhou Enlai's "Report on Visits to Eleven Asian and European Countries." I support Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech calling on the people of the whole country to cooperate with the government to carry out a massive campaign to increase production and practice economy. I suggest that this meeting make a resolution to actively respond and assist the government in deepening this movement.

　　I would now like to express some opinions on the enrollment of school-age children.

　　Since liberation, China's national economy has developed rapidly, and national education has also grown rapidly, with a significant increase in the number of children attending school. However, due to the poverty of old China, and at the same time, the people's living standards have improved after liberation, and the birth rate has increased positively, the country's current situation is still unable to enroll all children in a timely manner. This year's school-age children are exactly those born in the first year after liberation. It is estimated that the number of children who cannot enroll will reach 40%. The summer vacation is approaching, and this is a problem that deserves attention. However, most of these children are in rural areas, and although they cannot enroll in time, they can still participate in certain labor. The serious problem is probably still in the cities. Urban residents live in small houses, and if these six- or seven-year-old children are not enrolled in school, they will not only waste their time, but also easily be affected by some bad influences if they wander around the streets. It is also a mental burden for parents. However, since the state cannot solve the problem of enrolling all these children in the present and in the next few years, it is worth considering how to increase some supplementary education to reduce this pressure.

　　I am not an education researcher, nor do I engage in this work. From a layman's point of view, I believe that: it is a good way to set up tutorial classes, or more precisely, new private schools, in neighborhoods or buildings through urban grassroots residents' organizations and parties, groups, and individuals, and to employ unemployed intellectuals and housewives with considerable education and more time to serve as teachers to provide children with elementary education in Chinese language and arithmetic.

　　This will not only solve the problem of education for some children, but also open a way for intellectuals who are eager to find employment, including high school and junior high school graduates who cannot go on to higher education or find employment this year. Moreover, this will also enable these friends to contribute some strength to the country in a practical way, and also to exercise and educate themselves in the practice of work.

　　Of course, there are still problems here. The first is the issue of funding. I believe that these private schools have no major expenses other than rent, salaries, and utilities. It can be said that they are run in a simple and crude way. Since the expenses are small, the funding is easy to solve. The first is the students' tuition fees (of course, the fees should not be too high, and it is best to pay monthly to reduce the burden on parents). The second is that the organizers raise part of the funds. For example, residents' organizations can solicit donations from households with better living conditions, and parties and groups can solicit donations from their members or allocate part of their welfare funds. The national treasury probably does not need to bear the burden. The second is the housing problem. Urban housing is tight. But these private schools only need a living room, a side room, or even a small room. It is good to be able to accommodate twenty or thirty people, but it is also possible to accommodate only five or six people. It is best to be able to rent the whole thing, but it is also possible to borrow it for half a day. With such low requirements, although housing is tight, there will be a way.

　　In cities like Shanghai, there is one or two such private schools in every neighborhood and every building, and a thousand private schools would not be an overestimate. Averaging twenty people per school, then it can accommodate 20,000 people. If there are two shifts in the morning and afternoon, then 40,000 children can receive some education. If each private school has one Chinese teacher and one arithmetic teacher, it will also solve the employment problem for 2,000 people.

　　However, such a new thing, if it is to be established universally, and if the masses are to consciously and automatically engage in it, it cannot be done without the promotion and support of all sectors of society. Therefore, the local organizations of the CPPCC at all levels should actively play a role. I suggest that the local organizations of the CPPCC at all levels establish a special committee to publicize, promote, and organize this work. It is necessary to organize forces to go to these private schools regularly to understand and inspect them. In this way, not only will it assist the education authorities to strengthen leadership and supervision, but it will also certainly arouse people's attention to these private schools, strengthen parents' confidence, and greatly encourage the enthusiasm of these teachers, so as to make these private schools play the greatest effect.

　　In addition, the local organizations of the CPPCC at all levels can also organize some members with more time and members of various democratic parties to participate in this work specifically (including serving as teachers). This is also to help these comrades make more contributions to the country and better improve themselves in their work.

　　The above opinions are all layman's words from a layman. Are they appropriate? Is there even a bit of merit to them? I respectfully ask all the members for their comments and hope that the relevant parties will consider them! (Attached picture)

### 盛康年说　提倡市民办私塾　是解决学龄儿童入学的一个可行办法

　　盛康年说
　　提倡市民办私塾
　　是解决学龄儿童入学的一个可行办法
    我完全同意周恩来主席的“关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告”。拥护陈云副总理发言中号召全国人民与政府通力合作，进行一个巨大的增产节约运动。建议本次会议作出决议，积极响应，协助政府把这一运动深入展开。
    我现在就及龄儿童的入学问题，发表一些意见。
    解放以来，我国国民经济有了飞跃发展，国民教育也有迅速增长，儿童就学数字大大增加。但是由于旧中国的底子太穷，同时，解放后人民生活有了改善，出生率有了积极的增加，因之国家今日的情况，还无法把所有的儿童都能及时入学。今年的及龄入学儿童，正是解放后第一年所生产的。据估计不能入学的数字将达40％。转瞬暑期，不能不说是一个值得注意的问题。不过，这些儿童多数是在农村，虽不能及时入学，却还可以参加一定劳动。问题严重的恐怕还是在城市。城市居民，居住房屋狭小，这些六、七岁儿童如果不入学受教，不仅荒废光阴，而且任其街头闲荡，极易受上一些不良影响。也是做父母的一种精神负担。但是国家在目前和以后若干年内，既是无法解决这些儿童的全部入学，那么怎样来增加一些补助教育以减轻这方面的压力，是值得我们大家考虑的。
    我不是研究教育的，也不是搞这一项工作的。从外行人来看，以为：通过城市基层的居民组织和党派、团体以及私人在里弄或大楼中普设补习班，确切些说，是新的私塾，运用失业知识分子，和受过相当教育而比较有时间的家庭妇女来担任教师，给儿童以语文、算术的启蒙教育，不失是一个办法。
    这样做，不仅解决了一部分儿童的受教育问题，而且也给急于就业的知识分子，包括本届毕业的无法升学又无法就业的高、初中毕业生，开一条路。并且这也是使这些朋友可以切实地为国家贡献一些力量，更在工作的实践中，锻炼自己，教育自己。
    当然，这里还存在着问题。首先是经费问题。我认为这些私塾除了房租薪水水电等以外是没有什么大开支的，可以说是因陋就简的办学。开支既少，经费就容易解决。第一是学生的学费（当然收费是不宜大，而且最好按月付，以减轻家长负担）。第二是主办单位募集一部分。像居民组织主办的向生活较好的住户劝募一些，党派团体主办的向自己成员劝募一部分或由自己福利费等拨付一部分。国库大概可以勿必负担。其次是房屋问题。城市房屋是紧张的。但这些私塾只要一间客堂、厢房，甚至亭子间都可。能容纳二、三十人的固好，只能容纳五、六人也可。能全租的最好，只能借半天的也无不可。这样低的要求，房屋虽是紧张，不会没有办法的。
    像上海那样城市，每条里弄，每座大楼都有一个或二个那样的私塾，一千个私塾不会是过高的估计。平均以二十人计，那么就能收二万人。假使上下午二班的话，就可使四万个孩子受到一些教育了。如果每所私塾有一位语文教师一位算术教师的话，也就解决了二千人的就业。
    但是这样一件新的事情，要普遍设立，又要群众自觉自动来搞，没有社会各方面力量的推动与支持，是办不通的。因此政协各级地方组织就应积极发挥作用。我建议政协各级地方组织成立一个专门委员会来宣传、推动、组织这项工作。要组织力量经常到这些私塾去了解视察。这样，不仅协助教育当局来加强领导监督，并且一定会引起人们对这些私塾的重视，加强家长们的信心，大大鼓舞这些教师们的积极性，从而使得这些私塾发挥最大的效果。
    另外，政协各级地方组织还可以组织一部分时间较多的委员和各民主党派的成员来具体参加这项工作（包括担任教师），这也是帮助这部分同志更多地为国家作出贡献，更好地在工作中提高自己。
    以上意见，都是外行人说的外行话，究竟是否妥当？有无一分可采之处？敬请各位委员指正，并盼有关方面加以考虑！（附图片）
