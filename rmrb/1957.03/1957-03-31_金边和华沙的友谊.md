    The Friendship Between Phnom Penh and Warsaw
    Zhang Yao

    On the afternoon of March 21st, three silver-white Air India planes landed one after another at Pochentong Airport in Phnom Penh. A burst of applause and cheers like spring thunder suddenly erupted from the waiting crowd as Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Prime Minister San Yun of the Kingdom of Cambodia stepped forward to greet Chairman Cyrankiewicz of the Polish Council of Ministers as he disembarked. He was the second leader of a socialist country invited to visit the Kingdom. Chairman Cyrankiewicz, radiant and physically robust, smiled and warmly shook hands and waved to the welcoming crowd. Young girls presented beautiful bouquets, and the band played the national anthems of Cambodia and Poland, their music and the flags of the two countries fluttering in the air. Everything was immersed in an atmosphere of peace and friendship.

    This friendly scene, like Premier Zhou Enlai's visit four months earlier, demonstrates the victory of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Prince Sihanouk was absolutely right when he said in his welcoming speech to Chairman Cyrankiewicz: "Your visit, and Premier Zhou Enlai's visit before yours, further prove that full understanding is possible between peoples who have different ideologies but are inspired by the same desire for peace and the same desire to contribute to the maintenance of world peace."

    Geographically, Poland and Cambodia are thousands of miles apart, and historically there has been little contact between them, but the desire to maintain peace has linked the two countries together. After the 1954 Geneva Conference, Poland was one of the first countries to recognize Cambodia and, as a member of the International Supervisory and Control Commission, came to Cambodia to help restore peace and implement the Geneva Accords. Over the past two years, Cambodia has restored peace and implemented the Geneva Accords, and the friendship between Poland and Cambodia has greatly increased. In June last year, Prince Sihanouk paid a friendly visit to Poland, and issued a joint statement with Polish leaders, announcing that the two countries would establish relations on the basis of recognizing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and strengthen economic and cultural cooperation. Subsequently, Poland and Cambodia exchanged diplomatic envoys and strengthened economic ties. In January of this year, the National Congress of the People's Social Alliance highly valued the work of the International Commission and decided to request the International Commission to remain in Cambodia as an international witness to help maintain peace and prevent Cambodia from being invaded. The friendly relations between Poland and Cambodia have been further developed.

    It was on this basis that the Polish guests came to visit the Kingdom of Cambodia. The Royal Government of Cambodia received Chairman Cyrankiewicz and his delegation with grand ceremony. Cyrankiewicz and his wife were welcomed to reside in the Royal Palace; on the evening of their arrival, the King and Queen held a grand welcoming banquet. The next day, Prince Sihanouk accompanied the Polish guests to enjoy dragon boat races at the floating palace on the water and personally introduced Chairman Cyrankiewicz to the masses. Prime Minister San Yun accompanied the guests to Siem Reap Province to visit the Angkor ruins and to Kampong Cham Province to visit rubber plantations.

    The Cambodian people expressed great enthusiasm for the Polish guests. Tens of thousands of people not only went to the airport to welcome the guests, but also waited to admire their demeanor in the places where the Polish guests visited. People flocked to the exhibition "Life in Poland" in front of the Royal Palace, which vividly introduced the grand reception Prince Sihanouk received during his visit to Poland last summer, as well as the country, resources, economy, culture, and people's lives of Poland, through pictures, texts, and objects. People also crowded to see the Polish films being shown outdoors. The Cambodian people want to deeply understand the friendly country of Poland.

    With the exception of a few right-wing newspapers hostile to peace and neutrality, almost all newspapers here in various languages published editorials welcoming the Polish guests and hailing the victory of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence! The Cambodian News Agency movingly reported the Cambodian people's friendly feelings towards the Polish people, saying: "Our beautiful Phnom Penh will never forget the harmonious, enthusiastic, and heartfelt welcome that the people of Warsaw extended to Prince Sihanouk; therefore, she also uses extremely fresh and beautiful decorations to welcome this country's famous statesman, striving to be like Warsaw's welcome to the Prince. Triumphal arch-style pylons, verdant and lush, decorate the roads the Polish guests pass, with banners written in Polish and Cambodian welcoming the guests, praising the friendship between the peoples of Poland and Cambodia, which, though young, is already consolidated and unbreakable."

    Chairman Cyrankiewicz also said at a press conference: "To this friendly country, I can only say that I am deeply moved by the warm welcome of its people, not to mention the meticulous care of the King, the Queen, Prince Sihanouk, and the Cambodian government leaders towards us. All this shows the profound friendship of Cambodia towards the Polish people. Everywhere we have been, we have seen enthusiastic expressions and smiling, lovely faces. Although we are thousands of miles apart from Cambodia, I want to bring the enthusiasm of the Cambodian people back to the Polish people as much as possible. The Polish people are very willing to see the Cambodian people enjoy the same freedom and independence as they do, and to build an unbreakable friendship on the principle of non-interference in each other's internal affairs." He said: "I have also seen Cambodia's ancient cultural monuments, which are deeply imprinted in my heart and will never be forgotten. This ancient cultural heritage is well worth admiring, as it reflects the labor achievements of the Cambodian people."

    As an important symbol of the friendship of this visit, the Chairman of the Polish Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister of Cambodia signed and issued a joint communiqué on the evening of March 23. The communiqué reaffirmed the desire of both countries to continue their efforts to maintain world peace, and believed that "supervised and universal disarmament, the establishment of international economic and cultural cooperation based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit and respect for the absolute independence of large and small countries, will achieve the above-mentioned goals. The frequent implementation of neutral policies by some large Asian countries will also be an important factor for world peace." The communiqué also stated: "The two governments are pleased to confirm that the political, economic, and cultural relations between the People's Republic of Poland and the Kingdom of Cambodia, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, have very good prospects, and agree to make every effort to develop this relationship to the widest possible extent." Chairman Cyrankiewicz also announced at the press conference that if Cambodia needs it, Poland will send technicians and experts to Cambodia upon invitation to help with construction; it also welcomes Cambodia to send students to Poland to study industry and other fields.

    Chairman Cyrankiewicz and his delegation left Cambodia on March 24 to continue their friendly visits to other countries. This visit further strengthened the friendship between Poland and Cambodia, proved that the spirit of the Bandung Conference is being carried forward, and once again shattered the rumors of the enemies of peaceful neutrality. Let those who hate peaceful coexistence dream on, countries around the world will coexist peacefully in fact. Long live the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence!

    金边和华沙的友谊
    张瑶
    3月21日下午，三架银白色的印度航空公司的飞机，先后在金边的波士东机场降落。在久候的人群中突然爆发出春雷一样的掌声和欢呼声，柬埔寨王国的宾努亲王和桑云首相走向飞机跟前迎接正在走下飞机的波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹。他是第二个应邀访问这个王国的社会主义国家的领导人。容光焕发、身体魁伟的西伦凯维兹主席微笑着同欢迎的人亲切握手和招手致意。少女们献上了美丽的花束，乐队奏起柬埔寨和波兰两国的国歌，乐声同两国国旗一起在空中飘扬。一切都沉浸在和平和友谊的氛围里。
    这个友好的情景，和四个月前周恩来总理访问时一样，表明了和平共处原则的胜利。宾努亲王在向西伦凯维兹主席致欢迎词时说得非常正确，他说：“您的访问以及在您访问以前周恩来总理的访问都更加证明，具有不同观念形态但却为同样的和平意愿、同样的要对维持世界和平作出贡献的愿望所鼓舞的人民之间，是有可能充分谅解的。”
    从地理上讲，波兰和柬埔寨相隔万里，在历史上也从来很少有过往来，但是维护和平的愿望把两国联系了起来。1954年日内瓦会议后，波兰是最先承认柬埔寨的国家之一，并且以国际监督和监察委员会委员的身份，来柬埔寨帮助恢复和平，实现日内瓦协定。两年来，柬埔寨已经恢复了和平、实现了日内瓦协定，波兰和柬埔寨两国之间的友谊也大大增进了。去年6月，西哈努克亲王到波兰进行友好的访问，同波兰领导人发表了联合声明，宣布两国在承认和平共处五项原则的基础上建立彼此的关系，并且加强经济和文化方面的合作。随后波兰和柬埔寨互派了外交使节，加强了经济联系。今年1月，人民社会同盟全国代表大会对国际委员会的工作作了很高的估价，并且决定要求国际委员会作为国际证人继续留在柬埔寨，帮助维护和平，防止柬埔寨被侵略。波兰和柬埔寨的友好关系得到进一步的发展。
    正是在这个基础上，波兰贵宾们来到柬埔寨王国访问。柬埔寨王国政府用隆重的礼节接待了西伦凯维兹主席和他的代表团。西伦凯维兹和夫人被迎接在皇宫内居住；到达的当晚，国王和王后就举行了盛大的欢迎宴会。第二天，西哈努克亲王陪同波兰贵宾们在水上浮宫欣赏龙舟竞赛，并且亲自向群众介绍西伦凯维兹主席。桑云首相陪同贵宾们到暹粒省游览吴哥古迹和到磅湛省参观橡胶园。
    柬埔寨人民对波兰贵宾们表示了极大的热情。成千上万的人群不仅到机场去欢迎贵宾们，而且在波兰贵宾们参观游览的地方伫候瞻仰丰采。人们川流不息地到皇宫前参观“波兰生活”的展览会，这里用图片、文字和实物，生动地介绍了西哈努克亲王去年夏天访问波兰时受到隆重接待的情形，介绍了波兰的国家、富源、经济、文化和人民的生活状况。人们也拥挤着去看露天放映的波兰电影。柬埔寨人想深入地了解友好的国家波兰。
    除了很少几家右派和仇视和平中立的报纸，几乎所有这里的各种文字的报纸都发表社论欢迎波兰贵宾们，欢呼和平共处五项原则万岁！柬埔寨通讯社动人地报道了柬埔寨人民对波兰人民的友好感情，它说：“我们美丽的金边，永远不会忘记华沙人民对西哈努克亲王表示的那种融洽、热烈和由衷的欢迎；因此她也用极新鲜美好的装饰，来欢迎这个国家著名的政治家，力求做到像华沙对亲王的欢迎那样。一座座青翠的凯旋门式牌楼，装饰在波兰贵宾们经过的路上，横额的标语用波兰文和柬埔寨文写着欢迎贵宾的字句，歌颂虽然年青然而已经巩固和不可动摇的波柬两国人民的友谊。”
    西伦凯维兹主席在记者招待会上也说：“对这个友好的国家，我只能说我被它的人民的热烈欢迎所深深地感动，更不用说国王、王后、西哈努克亲王和柬埔寨政府领袖们对我们无微不至的关怀。这一切表示了柬埔寨对波兰人民的深厚友谊。在我们所经过的地方，我们到处看到热情流露和微笑的可爱面孔。我们和柬埔寨虽然相隔万里，但我要尽可能把柬埔寨人民对我们的热情带回给波兰人民。波兰人民很愿意看见柬埔寨人民和他们一样得到自由、独立，大家在互不干涉内政的原则上，建立牢不可破的友谊。”他说：“我还看见了柬埔寨的千年文化古迹，它深深地印在我的心里，永远不会忘记。这个古老文化遗迹十分值得欣赏，它反映出柬埔寨人民的劳动成就。”
    作为这次访问的友好的重要标志，波兰部长会议主席和柬埔寨首相在3月23日晚上签署和发表了联合公报。公报重申了两国继续努力维护世界和平的愿望，并且认为“监督和普遍裁军、根据平等互利原则和尊重大小国家的绝对独立以建立国际间的经济和文化合作将可以达到上述目的。一些大的亚洲国家经常执行中立政策也将是世界和平的重要因素。”公报还说：“两国政府满意地确认：建立在和平共处五项原则上的波兰人民共和国和柬埔寨王国之间的政治、经济和文化关系，有着很好的远景，并且同意将在更广泛的可能范围内尽力发展这种关系。”西伦凯维兹主席在记者招待会上还宣布：如果柬埔寨需要的话，波兰将应邀派出技术人员和专家来柬埔寨帮助建设；也欢迎柬埔寨派遣留学生到波兰学习工业等。
    西伦凯维兹主席和他的代表团已经在3月24日离开柬埔寨继续到其他国家进行友好访问。这次访问进一步加强了波兰和柬埔寨两国的友谊，证明了万隆会议的精神正在发扬光大，也再一次粉碎了和平中立敌人的谣言。让仇视和平共处的人去梦想吧，世界各国将在事实上和平共处。和平共处五项原则万岁！
