Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 1st: The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a political work conference for colleges and universities from February 25th to 27th.

    The conference affirmed the achievements of the past political and ideological education work for college students and analyzed the existing shortcomings. The conference believes that the political and ideological education work in the past was very one-sided, focusing on one aspect while neglecting the other, failing to grasp or solve the main problems in ideological education, and had serious dogmatic tendencies. The education methods were simple and rigid, divorced from the students' learning, life, and ideological reality. At the same time, the mass line was not implemented enough, and the role of the masses was not fully utilized in ideological work.

    The conference emphasized that future political and ideological education should focus on solving the following problems: First, the content of political education must be regularly and repeatedly integrated into all subject teaching and daily political and ideological work; strengthen students' education in Marxist-Leninist theory courses, establish students' revolutionary outlook on life, and enable students to learn to observe and analyze problems from the standpoint and viewpoint of the working class and with the method of dialectical materialism. At the same time, ideological education should be carried out in various forms in light of the ideological trends of students in each period; it is necessary to prevent and correct one-sidedness, and not only talk about the happy prospects of socialist construction while ignoring the arduous struggle to realize socialist construction, only talk about democracy while ignoring centralization, only talk about giving play to personal strengths while ignoring national needs, and only talk about freedom while ignoring discipline, etc. Second, political and ideological education should be regularized, because new problems will arise after the old problems of students' thinking are solved, and these ideological problems must be solved unremittingly at all times. Third, strengthen the relationship between the Party and the masses, improve the relationship between teachers and students, and give full play to the role of teachers in ideological work.

    The conference also studied the issues of staffing and improving political work cadres in colleges and universities.

    学校政治思想工作
    要克服片面性和教条主义
    辽宁省委召开大专学校政治工作会议
    新华社沈阳1日电  中共辽宁省委在2月25日至27日召开了大专学校政治工作会议。
    会议肯定了过去对大专学生进行政治思想教育工作的成绩，并对存在的缺点作了分析。会议认为过去政治思想教育工作中片面性很大，讲了这一面忽视了那一面，没有抓住或解决思想教育工作中的主要问题，并有严重的教条主义倾向。教育方式简单生硬。脱离学生学习、生活、思想实际。同时贯彻群众路线不够，没有在思想工作中充分发挥群众作用。
    会议强调今后的政治思想教育着重解决下面几个问题：首先，必须把政治教育内容经常地反复地贯串到各科教学和日常政治思想工作中去；加强学生的马克思列宁主义理论课程教育，确立学生革命人生观，使学生学习以工人阶级的立场、观点和辩证唯物主义的方法来观察分析问题。同时要针对各个时期的学生思想动态，利用各种形式进行思想教育；要防止和纠正片面性，不要只讲社会主义建设的幸福远景，而忽略实现社会主义建设的艰苦奋斗，只讲民主而忽略集中，只讲发挥个人特长而忽视国家需要，只讲自由而忽视纪律等。其次，政治思想教育要经常化，因为学生思想的旧问题解决后新问题又会产生，必须时刻不懈地来解决这些思想问题。第三，密切党群关系，改进师生关系，充分发挥教师在思想工作中的作用。
    会议还研究了大专学校政治工作干部的配备和提高等问题。
