    Xinning Food Company Abuses Good Cattle

    The Xinning County Food Company in Hunan Province purchased 219 head of so-called "disabled" draft cattle between October and December of last year. According to veterinary inspections, 30% of these cattle were capable of plowing, and five were pregnant cows, but all were slaughtered. Afterwards, the local procuratorate raised objections to the company, and the "New Hunan Daily" also criticized it. The local Party and government leading organs even issued a special circular. However, the company turned a deaf ear and adopted even more egregious means to abuse good cattle in order to achieve the goal of declaring them unusable and slaughtering them. In October of last year, five cattle were identified by veterinarians as capable of plowing and not to be slaughtered. The county procuratorate requested that the company immediately return them to the original sellers or raise and protect them. However, in the past month or so, due to the company's abuse, in addition to one pregnant cow that froze and starved to death, veterinary inspections show that the remaining four have all lost their ability to plow and are about to be declared unusable. It is recommended that relevant departments promptly deal with the Xinning County Food Company's repeated violations of policy.

    新宁食品公司摧残好牛
    湖南新宁县食品公司在去年10月至12月先后收购了所谓“残废”耕牛二百一十九头；根据兽医检查，其中有30％是有耕作能力的耕牛，还有五头孕牛，但都被宰杀了。事后，当地检察院曾向该公司提出意见，“新湖南报”也曾予以批评，当地党政领导机关并专门发了通报。但该公司竟置若罔闻，采取更恶劣的手段摧残好牛，以达报废宰杀的目的。去年10月，有五头牛经兽医鉴定有耕作能力不能宰杀，县检察院要求该公司立即退回原卖主，或饲养保护。但一个多月来，由于该公司的摧残，除冻饿死一头孕牛外，据兽医检查，其余四头全部失去耕作能力，快要报废了。建议有关部门对新宁县食品公司一再违犯政策的行为迅速处理。  陈子平
