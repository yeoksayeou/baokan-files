　　Strictly Economize on Timber in New Railway Construction
　　Last year, the Second Engineering Bureau of the New Railway Construction General Bureau of the Ministry of Railways inspected the use of timber in the newly built Baoji-Chengdu, Neijiang-Kunming, and Sichuan-Guizhou railway projects, and found that over 10,000 cubic meters of timber that could have been used but was not, were scattered at various construction sites. Some of this timber was unused because the material application plans of the construction sections and teams were not realistic, or because of design modifications and task changes which led to excessive procurement. Some was due to the failure to conscientiously implement material requisition and return systems and storage regulations, and some was discarded after the completion of the projects. For example, at a construction site of the Neijiang-Kunming Railway, many wooden roads and supports were buried in the mud after completion. According to construction management personnel, the buried timber accounted for 30% of the total timber initially requisitioned.
    The above are the wastes that can be seen. As for those that cannot be seen, such as using large materials for small purposes and burning usable timber as firewood, the waste caused is also very serious. For example, in the Lueyang-Huangshaohe section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the value of timber consumed due to exceeding the budget quota for bridge and tunnel projects in the first half of last year alone reached more than 200,000 yuan. The Mechanical Road Construction Engineering Team of the Second Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways even burned 310,000 kilograms of usable timber as firewood. As another example, the No. 13 Work Zone of the First Engineering Section of the Neijiang-Kunming Railway requisitioned more than 49 cubic meters of timber in the third quarter of last year, and the No. 14 Work Zone requisitioned more than 42 cubic meters of timber in the third quarter of last year. Except for some used as supports and scaffolding, the rest was used as paving for wheelbarrow paths, and many have been crushed.
    Timber is a valuable resource in national construction. At present, the national timber supply is insufficient, while the demand for new railway construction is very large. Therefore, how to pay attention to saving timber in new railway construction projects has great significance.

### 新建铁路要严格节约木材

　　新建铁路要严格节约木材
　　铁道部新建铁路工程总局第二工程局去年曾检查了宝成、内昆和川黔等新建铁路工程中的木材使用情况，发现散失在各工点的可以利用而没有利用的木材就有一万多立公方。这些木材，有的是由于施工段、队的材料申请计划不切合实际，或者因为修改设计、变更任务，领多了没有用了；有的是由于没有认真执行领退料制度和保管制度，有的是由于工程竣工以后被扔掉的。如内昆铁路一个工点用木料架设的道路和支撑，完工后很多都被埋在泥土里，据施工管理人员说，埋掉的木料要占最初领用的木料总数的30％。
    以上是可以看到的浪费，至于那些看不到的，如大材小用、把可用的木材当柴烧掉等所造成的浪费也是非常严重的。如宝成铁路略
  （阳）黄（沙河）段仅在去年上半年桥梁隧道工程超过预算定额而多耗费的木材价值就达二十多万元。铁道部第二工程局机械筑路工程队竟将三十一万公斤可用的木材当柴烧掉了。再如内昆铁路第一工程段一三工区去年第三季度领了四十九立公方多的木材，一四工区去年第三季度领了四十二立公方多的木材。除部分用做支撑和搭跳板外，其余的都用做独轮车路的垫板，而且不少已被辗坏了。
    木材是国家建设中的宝贵物资。目前，国家木材供应不足，而新建铁路的需用量又很大。因此，如何在新建铁路工程中注意节约木材的使用具有重大的意义。
