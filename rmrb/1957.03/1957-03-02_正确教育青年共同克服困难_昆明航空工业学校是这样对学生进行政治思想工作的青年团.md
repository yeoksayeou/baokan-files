Correctly Educate Young People to Overcome Difficulties Together
——This is How the Communist Youth League at Kunming Aviation Industry School Conducts Political and Ideological Work for Students
Dong Xuelong, Deputy Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee

We often encounter difficulties on our road to building socialism. Difficulties are not terrible. The question is what attitude we take towards them: a Marxist-Leninist attitude or a bureaucratic attitude. If we adopt the former, all difficulties can be overcome.

The fact that Kunming Aviation Industry School has been able to unite all teachers and students and adhere to running the school diligently and thriftily amidst numerous difficulties is a good example.

Kunming Aviation Industry School was founded in September last year. The school has 820 students, 500 of whom were recruited from Hunan.

When recruiting students in Hunan, the staff responsible for the recruitment made exaggerated propaganda to the applicants, saying that Kunming "has spring-like weather all year round, and the scenery is picturesque." They showed the students blueprints of the school buildings that had not yet been constructed, describing them as the finished school site.

Fortunately, the school leadership discovered this situation in time and realized that the consequences of such exaggerated propaganda would be unfavorable. They decided to take effective measures to correct it. The most important method was to strengthen political and ideological work.

On the day the students arrived, the principal and teachers went to the station to welcome them, personally helping the students carry their luggage. They proactively told the students the truth, explaining that the school buildings had just started construction and hoping that the students would overcome the temporary difficulties together with the school. In this way, although the actual situation of the school was far from as good as the students had originally imagined, the students were still happy to come to the school because they saw the teachers' enthusiasm, and they were also somewhat mentally prepared for the difficulties they would encounter later.

When the students arrived at the school, there were no classrooms or dormitories. For the first four months or so, they lived in the staff dormitories of Kunming Medical College, and classes were also held in the classrooms of Kunming No. 1 Middle School and No. 5 Middle School, and only during the lunch breaks and afternoon recreational activities of the students of No. 1 and No. 5 Middle Schools. Eating, sleeping, and going to class all required traveling long distances. The inconvenience and difficulties can be imagined. Some students complained that they had been deceived. At this time, the school leadership took the students to visit the construction site and encouraged them with the spirit of hard work and thrift in building the school. When the students saw the workers working hard to build school buildings for them, and saw that the workers lived in even worse shacks than they did, they stopped complaining and even picked up hoes and worked alongside the workers. They felt happy to be able to participate in the construction of the school and to establish a good school spirit of hard work for the first class of students.

Persuasion and education work is not only about talking, but also about action. One characteristic of this school's ideological work is that it not only clearly explains the great principles to the students, but also the responsible cadres set an example and share weal and woe with the students.

From the first day of school, the principal called on teachers, students, and staff to share weal and woe and overcome the temporary difficulties together. When living in the staff dormitories of Kunming Medical College, there was no dining hall, and teachers and students ate in an "open-air cafeteria." Whenever it rained, dry rice became porridge. But the students not only did not complain, but were moved and said: "The teachers' dry rice has also become porridge, are we young people still afraid of these difficulties?"

While calling on students to overcome difficulties, the school leadership also tried its best to solve the specific difficulties for the students under the possible conditions and meet the students' requirements as much as possible, demonstrating the greatest care for people.

When the students from Hunan discovered that Kunming, which was supposed to have "spring-like weather all year round," became "winter with a single rain," they complained again. At this time, the school leadership promptly bought them straw sandals, straw mats, and some cotton quilts. When they crawled into the cotton quilts to sleep, they not only did not feel bitter, but felt infinitely warm.

The staff dormitory had no walls, and thieves often came to steal at night. The students dared not open the windows to sleep. There were many people in a small room, and the air was really too stuffy. After the school leadership discovered this situation, they organized staff to take turns on night duty for the students, allowing the students to sleep with the windows open until dawn.

In addition to the school buying some cotton quilts and distributing them to the students, the faculty and staff also donated their extra clothes to the students who lacked clothes, thus helping ninety-nine students solve the difficulty of clothing. This kind of care from the teachers deeply moved the students.

Every Mid-Autumn Festival and Spring Festival, when the students from Yunnan went home, the school, thinking of these students who were far away from their hometowns, organized literary and art evenings in the school, allowing the Hunan students to perform Hunan dramas, flower drums, and folk songs that they had written and composed themselves, eliminating the students' homesickness during the holidays. In daily life, the school also took care of the Hunan students' habits of liking to eat chili peppers and take baths. In short, they tried their best to make these students feel like they were living in their hometown.

These things, though small, deeply educated the students. This is the most vivid and concrete communist education. The students understood how to deal with difficulties; how to care for others; how to give play to the spirit of collectivism. In the face of difficulties, they became stronger and stronger through training. They experienced the loveliness of the motherland and the loveliness of the school. Especially the children of working people, they showed a simple essence in their lives and showed a sincere affection for the Party. For example, those who had no shoes were satisfied with a pair of straw sandals; those who had no notebooks went to the construction site to pick up cement bags to make notebooks; if there were not enough lamps in the dormitory, they made their own oil lamps with ink bottles. Student Li Rongguo said: "The Communist Party liberated us and gave us the opportunity to study. Now we must overcome difficulties and study hard." "We come from Chairman Mao's hometown, and we must not let Chairman Mao down." This is their common language.

The school leadership conducted patient education for students who violated discipline. In the past six months, only one student who repeatedly refused to be taught was punished. This student's name was Xu Shuguang. He had always been dissatisfied with the school and did not attend classes for more than a month after arriving at the school. The homeroom teacher, the League branch secretary, and the principal had talked to him many times to educate him, but he did not change, and even spread rumors among the students. Finally, the school decided to give him a punishment and use this example to educate the students. At the same time, the League branch also published a wall newspaper and mobilized everyone to discuss it. This was completely right. Through the discussion of this living teaching material, the students' distinction between right and wrong was further clarified, and their ideological awareness was further improved.

The leaders of this school are not satisfied with the work they have done, and often approach the masses and humbly listen to their opinions. Usually, the principal and vice-principal often participate in the League branch committee meetings and listen to the students' opinions. The vice-principal said: "The students raised many good opinions, which helped us improve our leadership. We also explained to the students the opinions that cannot be realized at present." This allows the students to speak freely and does not allow the opinions to pile up.

In carrying out political and ideological work for students, the Communist Youth League has also played a significant role. Among the Youth League members, who account for 50% of all students, the phrase "Youth League members must act like League members" is widely circulated. This phrase plays a good role in encouraging League members to take the lead in overcoming difficulties, abiding by school discipline, and studying hard. This phrase was first said by a League member named Chen Xiulan. After the League organization discovered it, it put forward this sentence at the conference as a slogan for League members' actions. Each League member should make friends with classmates and help classmates with poor grades to make up for their lessons. In the dormitory, there is only one table, and the League members let the classmates use it, and find another place to study by themselves; in the cafeteria, it is very crowded to get rice, and the League members let the classmates get rice first. Liao Yanxin, who is tall, has a small cotton quilt that is not enough to cover, and League member Chen Zhihui gave him his big cotton quilt and covered himself with the small one. A classmate made an excuse that it was raining and he had no shoes to wear, so he didn't want to go to class. League member Zhao Heling lent him his only pair of shoes, and went to class barefoot himself. That classmate was moved and happily ran to class with the League member barefoot.

The example of Kunming Aviation Industry School vividly shows that our young people are indeed very lovable, and young people can inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of our older generation. The question is whether we can correctly and patiently educate them, encourage them, and improve them. As long as we adopt the correct educational methods, the younger generation will become a vital force in participating in socialist construction.

    正确教育青年共同克服困难
    ——昆明航空工业学校是这样对学生进行政治思想工作的青年团
    云南省委副书记  董学隆
    在我们建设社会主义的道路上经常会遇到困难。困难并不可怕，问题是要看我们用什么态度去对待困难：用马克思列宁主义的态度，还是用官僚主义的态度；如果我们采取的是前一种态度，那么，一切困难都是可以战胜的。
    昆明航空工业学校在重重困难下能够团结全体师生，坚持勤俭办校就是一个好榜样。
    昆明航空工业学校是去年9月创办的，全校学生有八百二十人，其中五百人是从湖南招来的。
    远在湖南招考的时候，派去负责招考的工作人员曾经向投考学生作了夸大的宣传，他们说昆明“四季如春，山水如画”，他们把尚未动工的学校建筑蓝图给学生看了，说成是已经修好的校址。
    幸而学校领导上及时发现了这种情况，估计到，这种夸张的宣传的后果是不妙的，就决定采取有效的措施来加以纠正，最主要的办法是加强政治思想工作。
    在学生到达的那天，校长和教师都到车站去欢迎，亲自动手帮助学生搬行李，主动地给学生讲了真实情况，说明目前校舍刚开始建筑，希望同学们和学校共同克服暂时的困难。这样，学校的实际情况虽然远不如学生原来想像的那样好，但是学生看到师长们如此热情，也还是高高兴兴地到了学校，并且对以后遇到的困难也有了一些思想准备。
    当学生来到学校的时候，学校还没有教室和宿舍，在头四个多月中，借住在昆明医学院的职工宿舍里，上课也是借用昆明一中和五中的教室，并且只能利用一中和五中学生中午休息和下午文娱活动的时间上课。吃饭、睡觉、上课都要跑很远的路。不便和困难可想而知。有的学生就有了怨言，认为是受骗了。这时学校领导上就让学生去参观了建筑工地，并且以艰苦奋斗、勤俭建校的精神来鼓舞学生。当学生们看到工人们辛勤地为他们修建校舍的时候，看到工人们住的工棚比他们住的更坏的时候，他们不再抱怨了，而且还拿起锄头和工人们一起劳动起来  他们为自己能参加学校的建筑、为第一届学生能树立艰苦奋斗的良好校风而感到愉快。
    说服教育工作不只是靠嘴，更要靠行动。这个学校思想工作的一个特点，就是不仅向学生讲清了大道理，而且负责干部以身作则与学生同甘共苦。
    从开学的第一天起，校长就号召师生员工一齐同甘共苦，战胜暂时的困难。借住在昆明医学院职工宿舍的时候，没有饭厅，师生都在“露天食堂”吃饭。每逢雨天，干饭变成了稀饭。但是学生不但不抱怨，反而感动地说：“老师的干饭也变成了稀饭，我们年轻人还怕这些困难吗？”
    学校领导上在号召学生克服困难的同时，还在可能的条件下，尽量地为学生解决具体困难，尽可能地满足学生的要求，表现了对人的最大的关怀。
    当湖南的学生发现，“四季如春”的昆明“一雨便成冬”以后。又有怨言了。这时学校领导上及时给他们买了草鞋、草垫子和一些棉被，当他们钻进棉被睡觉的时候，他们不但不觉得苦，反觉得无限温暖了。
    职工宿舍没有围墙，夜间小偷常来活动，学生不敢开窗睡觉，人多房子小，空气实在闷的受不了。学校领导发觉这一情况后，就组织了职工轮流给学生值夜班，让学生开着窗一直睡到大天亮。
    除了学校买一些棉被发给学生外，教职员工还捐助了自己多余的衣服给缺衣服的学生，这样帮助九十九个学生解决了衣裳的困难。老师的这种关怀使学生很受感动。
    每当中秋节、春节，云南学生都回家去了的时候，学校为这些远离家乡的学生着想，就在学校里组织了文娱晚会，让湖南学生表演自己编自己唱的湖南剧、花鼓、小调等节目，消除了学生佳节思乡之念。在日常的生活中，学校也照顾了湖南的学生爱吃辣椒、爱洗澡等习惯。总之尽量做到让这些学生像生活在自己的家乡一样。
    这一些事情虽小，却使学生深深地受到了教育。这是最生动最具体的共产主义教育。学生们懂得了怎样去对待困难；怎样去关怀别人；怎样去发挥集体主义的精神。他们在困难的面前，愈锻炼愈坚强。他们体会到了祖国的可爱、学校的可爱。特别是劳动人民的子女，他们在生活中表现了朴实的本质，表现了对党的真挚的感情。如没有鞋穿的，领到一双草鞋就满足了；没有本子用的，就到工地上去捡包水泥的纸袋做本子；宿舍灯不够用，就用墨水瓶自己做个油灯点。学生李荣国说：“共产党解放了我们，有了读书的机会，现在就要克服困难，好好学习。”“我们来自毛主席的故乡，一定不能给毛主席丢脸”。这是他们共同的语言。
    学校领导上对于破坏纪律的学生都进行了耐心的教育，半年以来，只处分了一个屡教不改的学生。这个学生名叫徐曙光，他一直对学校不满，到校一个多月不上课。班主任、团支书和校长曾多次和他谈话，教育他，他不改，甚至在同学中散布流言。最后，学校决定给他处分并用这个实例教育广大学生。同时团支部也出壁报，发动大家讨论。这样作是完全对的，通过对这一活的教材的讨论，学生的是非界限进一步划清了，思想觉悟进一步提高了。
    这个学校的领导者并不以自己所作的工作为满足，还经常接近群众，虚心听取群众的意见。平时，校长、副校长常参加团的支委会，听取学生的意见。副校长说：“学生提了很多很好的意见，帮助我们改进了领导，对于学生所提的目前办不到的意见，我们也向学生做了解释。”这样就使学生经常能够畅所欲言，不致使意见成了堆。
    在对学生进行政治思想工作中，青年团也发挥了很大的作用。在占全体学生50％的青年团员中，普遍流传着“青年团员要做得像个团员的样子”这句话，这句话对于鼓励团员们在带头克服困难、遵守学校纪律、努力学习，起着良好的作用。这句话开始是一个叫做陈秀兰的团员说出来的。团的组织发现后，就在大会上提出了这句话，作为团员行动的口号。每个团员要和同学交朋友，帮助功课差的同学补习功课。在宿舍里，只有一张桌子，团员就让给同学用，自己另找地方自习；在食堂里盛饭很挤，团员就让同学先盛。高个子的廖彦新领着一条小棉被不够盖，团员陈志辉把自己的大棉被给了他，自己盖小的。一个同学借口下雨没有鞋子穿就不想去上课，团员赵和伶就把自己仅有的一双鞋借给他，自己赤着脚去上课。那个同学受了感动，也打起赤脚欢欢喜喜地同团员一起跑去上课。
    昆明航空工业学校的事例，生动地说明了我们的青年的确是非常可爱的，青年们是可以把我们老一辈的优良传统继承和发扬起来的。问题是要看我们能不能正确地耐心地去教育他们，鼓励他们，提高他们。只要我们采取了正确的教育方法，年青的一代就会成为参加社会主义建设的一支生力军。
