Some Thoughts After Listening to Chairman Mao's Report
Ouyang Yuqian

Chairman Mao's report at the Supreme State Conference expansion meeting on February 27th creatively applied the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and closely integrated it with China's revolutionary practice. It provided insightful analysis of major issues on our country's path of socialist construction, proposed solutions to various contradictions, and pointed out the correct direction. We express our heartfelt support for this report. Now I will share some personal thoughts:

Chairman Mao presented us with a major issue: to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and to distinguish between right and wrong. The contradiction between the enemy and ourselves differs in nature from the contradictions among the people, and the methods for resolving them should also be different. Many of us often confuse the contradiction between the enemy and ourselves with the contradictions among the people, which is very dangerous. If the nature of these two is not clearly distinguished, major problems may arise. Lenin once said that confrontation eliminates the existence of contradictions, but never before has anyone raised the issue as clearly as Chairman Mao. We should acknowledge that contradictions among the people will exist for a long time. Chairman Mao told us that antagonistic contradictions can be transformed into non-antagonistic contradictions, but if handled poorly, non-antagonistic contradictions can also be transformed into antagonistic contradictions. Our policy of peacefully transforming industry and commerce is to gradually transform capitalists into self-reliant laborers through peaceful means, but there are also individual cases where originally non-antagonistic contradictions have been transformed into antagonistic contradictions due to improper handling. Today, our timely understanding of this issue can help us avoid mistakes in our work, reduce deviations in handling problems, reduce many unnecessary troubles and disputes, better unite all forces that can be united, and give play to everyone's socialist enthusiasm to serve the socialist construction of the motherland.

This instruction from the Chairman has given us a key, a key to answering many complex questions. It has brought great gospel to the Chinese people in the construction of socialism.

Take us literary and art workers, for example. With this brilliant guidance, we can have a more correct understanding when experiencing life and observing characters. In the face of complex matters, we may be more confident, which is very conducive to creation.

To distinguish between right and wrong, we must first affirm the great achievements of socialist construction since the founding of our country. The achievements we have made in construction are undeniable even by imperialists and our enemies. In the literary and art circles alone, whether it is music, dance, fine arts, literature, film, or drama, significant achievements have been made in the past seven or eight years under the leadership of the Party and through the efforts of literary and art workers. Have there been mistakes in the literary and art circles? Yes. Have there been deviations? Yes. Even now, there are still many complex issues waiting for us to solve, and in the process of development, many problems will inevitably arise. But it must be said that achievements are the main aspect. For example, in drama reform, despite the existence of crude and conservative problems, Chinese opera has indeed removed a lot of dross and highlighted its essence in recent years, presenting a new look. Some individual leftist views that see only utter darkness are not in accordance with the facts. We will never conceal shortcomings; we must face up to them and strive to overcome them, but we must never obliterate achievements.

After the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend was put forward, although there was no open resistance, it seems that there are still quite a few people who doubt this policy and waver in its implementation. We believe that this policy is one hundred percent correct. This policy can help us clearly distinguish between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds—it is not terrible for fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds to grow together, as long as we can distinguish them clearly. And many poisonous weeds can be processed into effective medicines. As long as we know how to cultivate fragrant flowers and how to deal with poisonous weeds, we will not think of removing all the grass and letting only one flower bloom.

Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend can enable us to prosper in creation through free competition. New forces and new creations can only grow healthily in free competition. Healthy flowers and trees are never grown in greenhouses; they must be like pines and cypresses, able to withstand wind, rain, frost, and snow. Truth is revealed from the struggle against wrong ideas. Without struggle, we cannot approach the truth; without struggle, there is no victory. Without severe struggle, no reliable strength will be produced. Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is the best policy for distinguishing between right and wrong. Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend can develop science; it can cultivate the people's appreciation and discernment, so that people can all know what is true, good, and beautiful, and what is false, bad, and ugly. This policy only has positive effects and will not bring negative effects. I would like to cite the example of opening up repertory since last year:

There are different opinions about the opening of repertory. Some comrades have conducted more in-depth investigations and studies, proving that this measure still yields more gains than shortcomings.

First, it has enriched the repertory and discovered many good plays. Before the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom was put forward, some troupes were limited to only three plays. Fujian Province unearthed more than 10,000 traditional plays. Last year, about 500 were released, which is more than the total number of plays before liberation. According to Comrade Chen Hong of Fujian, 70% of the scripts unearthed in Fujian can be staged without modification. Artists say that this is the last liberation after liberation. Sichuan Province has also sorted out many good scripts, which they did not dare to take out before. Some comedies are so good that even Molière and Goldoni cannot claim exclusive credit. Many other places have similar situations. Second, many types of opera have been discovered. Third, it has solved the problem of respecting veteran artists and learning from veteran artists—originally, artists in their forties and fifties were called coffin stuffings and no one paid attention to them. Since the opening of the repertory, young actors have to learn old plays, which shows a certain respect for veteran artists. Fourth, it has prospered theaters, making off-seasons not so off, and has greatly helped artists' livelihoods. For example, Comrade Liu Yumin, an actor of Shaanxi Opera in Xi'an, said that their troupe sorted out ten old programs last year. Because these programs are popular with the people, they sell very well. The artists' income has doubled, and the troupe also has a surplus. Xiang Opera artists have always had a hard life, earning a maximum of forty or fifty yuan per month, but now they can earn seventy or eighty to one hundred and twenty. In this way, their troupe also has the conditions for reproduction. There are many similar examples in other places. This also saves the government from having to provide relief everywhere.

Have some bad plays been released after the opening of the repertory? Yes, but not many. There were almost no bad plays in Tianjin. According to a survey by the Shanghai Branch of the Dramatists Association, there were five or six bad plays out of sixty plays in Shanghai. Among them, two or three were the worst, such as "Blood Case 303," "Diao Liu Shi," and "Three Flowers." Some people say that the number is more than that, possibly more.

After the opening of the repertory in Heilongjiang, a lively and prosperous phenomenon also emerged. However, plays such as "Peach Blossom Girl" and "Killing Son for Reward" also came out. According to statistics, the bad ones accounted for about one-tenth. Some plays, although not very healthy and not very toxic, can be modified.

Bad plays can be modified after criticism and discussion. One point must be made: today's audiences and artists have completely different awareness than before. Some artists said that we are modifying some bad words and phrases in old plays. We didn't feel anything before, but today we feel that we can't say them. Mr. Cheng Yanqiu's signature play "Suo Lin Nang" was previously considered to have problems with the script. Mr. Cheng and several other comrades revised it together and handed it over to a comrade in the Art Bureau. At that time, Mr. Cheng did not think that there was any serious problem with the original script. After the opening of the repertory, that comrade returned the original script to Mr. Cheng, thinking that it could be performed as it was without modification. But Mr. Cheng himself believed that some places needed to be revised. Mr. Cheng himself said that his point of view is different from the past.

The good effect of opening the repertory is the main aspect. The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend should be further implemented. To be honest, if the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom had not been put forward, no one would dare to stage plays since the May Fourth Movement.

Some places that have implemented the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom well have boldly let them bloom; some say they are letting them bloom, but are afraid that problems will arise and dare not let them bloom; some let them bloom less, as conditionally and controlled; and some have not let them bloom at all. Most comrades believe that both letting and contending are just a beginning and should continue. Being cautious and controlling is the same as not letting go. I think we should be bold in letting go.

Regarding the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, it can be said that no troupe is unhappy to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. Whether it is a public or private drama, opera, opera, or dance troupe, none of them fail to go to factories and the countryside, especially the small and medium-sized local opera troupes, whose lives are inseparable from workers and peasants. Even drama troupes in big cities often come into contact with many audiences, and every year they still have a certain amount of time to perform for factories, suburban rural areas (and sometimes even farther places), and sometimes for the troops. --Of course, some go down more often and some go down less often -- Some people say that drama troupes in cities only move around in three places: theaters, rehearsal halls, and dormitories. This is not entirely true. Moreover, the establishment of theater art is not contradictory to the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Some opera troupes go to the countryside, and in some areas they are often subject to unreasonable restrictions. Some individual areas still maintain feudal ideas of despising and discriminating against artists, and even demand bribes (such as forcing them to give away tickets) and commit acts of violence, beating, and arbitrary insults. Therefore, some local troupes said: "We don't hope for state subsidies, we only hope to send fewer red tickets and perform more times." Especially folk professional troupes are subject to the greatest restrictions. Of course, many areas have correct leadership ideas, and there are no such unreasonable phenomena, or fewer.

Some people say that there are too many old things, and the work of excavation and sorting can be stopped appropriately. I think the work of excavation and sorting is far from enough. How to accept the heritage and carry forward the tradition, there is still a lot of work to be done, and we need to make long-term efforts, not complete it by a deadline. Sorting out the old does not hinder creating the new, and it helps to develop the new. We cannot blame sorting out the old for the inability to write new creations. We must strongly support new things and take active measures to encourage them, not treat them rudely.

China's drama movement has been closely linked to political movements from the very beginning. For fifty years, it has established Chinese drama art. Not only has it made great achievements in art, but it has also achieved great victories in political struggles. Since we learned from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and the Stanislavski system, we have basically been able to master the creative method of socialist realism. However, there are also shortcomings of mechanically applying dogmas. In terms of creative thinking, it has more or less caused some confusion, but this phenomenon cannot be blamed on the Stanislavski system. It is only because of rigid application that deviations have occurred. We are correcting this error, and we believe that it is not difficult to correct.

In the art world, it generally seems calmer than other departments, but in fact, the wind that stirs a pool of spring water is not completely absent. In short, internal contradictions are still quite complex. But it must be noted that we are the masters of the country, and we should show the attitude of being the masters of our own affairs and unite all forces that can be united for the motherland. We should give play to our subjective initiative and actively solve contradictions in various ways, and we should never confuse ideas with the emotions of individuals towards individual events. As long as we implement the spirit of distinguishing between right and wrong as instructed by the Chairman, it is entirely possible to do so.

Finally, I think ideological leadership and ideological education are very important. Transforming thinking requires long-term efforts. We should strengthen the study of dialectical materialism, not only from books, but mainly from life, work, and the relationship between people, and deeply understand it. On the other hand, China also has experts in various fields, including artists. We should give these experts and scholars more respect and help. Generally speaking, there are very few people who do not want to make progress now, but we should not demand too much from those experts and scholars, nor should we squeeze them too tightly. The Chairman told us that ideological work cannot be treated with crude methods and cannot be carried out with administrative orders. As long as we don't stop, we don't have to be too anxious. I think Chairman Mao's metaphor of washing your face every day and sweeping the floor every day is very beneficial to each of us.

    听了毛主席的报告的几点体会
    欧阳予倩
    2月27日毛主席在最高国务会议扩大会议的报告，创造性地运用了马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，紧密地结合着中国的革命实践，对于我们祖国社会主义建设道路上的重大问题作了精辟的分析，提出了解决各种矛盾的办法，指示出正确的方向。我们对这一报告表示衷心的拥护。现在我谈谈个人的感想：
    主席对我们提出了一个重大的问题要我们分清敌我、分清是非。敌我的矛盾跟人民内部的矛盾两者性质不同，解决的方法也就应当不同。我们有很多人往往把敌我的矛盾跟人民内部的矛盾混淆起来，这是非常危险的。如果这两者的性质不分别清楚，就可能出大乱子。列宁曾经说过对抗消灭矛盾存在，但是还从来没有像毛主席这样明确的提出问题，我们应当承认人民内部的矛盾是会长期存在的。主席告诉我们，对抗性的矛盾可能转化为非对抗性的矛盾，但是处理得不好，非对抗性的矛盾也可能转化为对抗性的矛盾。我们和平改造工商业的政策，就是以和平的方式使资本家逐渐转变成为自食其力的劳动者，但是其他有些个别的事件，本来是非对抗性的矛盾，因处理不当而转化成对抗性的矛盾的这种例子也不是没有。在今天我们及时地明白了这个问题，就可以使我们在工作中少犯错误，在处理问题的时候可以少犯偏差，减少许多不必要的麻烦和纠纷，更好地团结一切可能团结的力量，发挥每一个人的社会主义积极性，为祖国的社会主义建设服务。
    主席这一指示给了我们一个钥匙，能够解答许多复杂问题的钥匙。给中国人民在社会主义的建设当中，带来了伟大的福音。
    就说我们文艺工作者，得到光辉的照耀，在我们体验生活、观察人物的时候，更能有正确的认识和理解，在复杂的事项面前，可能比较心中有数，这很有利于创作。
    我们要分清是非，首先必须肯定我们建国以来，社会主义建设的伟大成绩。我们在建设方面的成绩就是帝国主义者、我们的敌人也不能不承认。单就我们文艺界而言，无论是音乐舞蹈、美术、文学、电影、戏剧，在党的领导下通过文艺工作者的努力，七八年来成绩是显著的。在文艺界有没有犯过错误？有。有没有偏差？有。就是现在也还存在许多复杂的问题等待我们解决，在发展中也不可避免地还会产生许多问题，但是必须说成绩是主要的。例如：戏剧改革，尽管还存在着粗暴和保守的问题，但是中国的戏曲这几年来，的确去掉了不少糟粕，突出了它的精华部分，呈现了新的面貌。有个别过左的看法，认为只是一团漆黑，那是不符合事实的。我们决不隐讳缺点，必须正视缺点，努力克服缺点，但决不能抹煞成绩。
    在百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针提出之后，虽然没有公开的抗拒表现，但是对这个方针怀疑的，在执行当中摇摆的似乎也还不少。我们认为这个方针是百分之百正确的。这个方针可以帮助我们明确地分清香花和毒草——香花和毒草同长并不可怕，只要能分别清楚。还有许多有毒性的草，可以经过泡制成为特效药。我们只要知道如何培养香花，如何处理毒草，就不会想到把所有的草都除掉只让一花独放。
    百花齐放、百家争鸣就可以使我们在自由竞赛之中，繁荣创作。新生力量、新的创作也只有在自由竞赛当中，才能健康地成长起来。健康的花、树决不是在温室里长大的，要如松柏，经得起风雨霜雪。真理是从对错误的思想作斗争显示出来的，没有斗争就不能接近真理，没有斗争就没有胜利。不经过严重的斗争，就不会产生可靠的力量。百花齐放、百家争鸣是分清是非最好的方针。百花齐放、百家争鸣可以发展科学；可以培养人民的欣赏力和辨别力，使人们都能知道，什么是真的善的美的，什么是假的坏的丑的。这个方针只有积极作用，不会带来消极作用。我想试举去年以来开放剧目为例：
    关于剧目开放有些不同的意见。有些同志下去作了比较深入的调查研究，证明这一措施还是收获多而缺点少的。
    第一、是丰富了剧目，发现了许多好的剧目。百花齐放方针提出之前有的剧团被限制到只剩三个戏。福建省发掘的传统剧目有一万多个，去年放出五百个左右，比解放前所有剧目的总和还要多。据福建陈虹同志说，福建所发掘的剧本有70％不经修改就能上演。艺人们说这是解放后最后的解放。四川省也整理出了许多好的剧本，都是以前不敢拿出来的，有的喜剧就是莫里哀和哥尔多尼都不能专美。还有许多地方也有同样的情形。第二、发现了许多剧种。第三、解决了尊重老艺人和向老艺人学习的问题——原来四五十岁的艺人就被称为棺材瓤子，没有人理。从剧目开放以后，年青演员要学老剧目，才对老艺人表示一定的尊重。第四、繁荣了剧场，使淡月不淡，艺人生活得到很大的帮助。例如西安陕西梆子的演员刘毓民同志说，他们的剧团去年整理出十个老节目，因为这些节目都是老百姓喜闻乐见的，卖座很好，艺人的收入增加了一倍，剧团还有了节余。湘戏的艺人素来生活很苦，最多的每月拿四、五十元，现在可以拿七、八十到一百二。这样他们的剧团也有了再生产的条件。其他的地方也有不少同样的例子。这就使政府也免得到处去救济。
    剧目开放后是不是也放出了些不好的剧目呢？是有的，但并不多。天津几乎没有出现什么坏戏，据剧协上海分会的调查，上海在六十个戏当中有五、六个是不好的。其中有两、三个比较最坏，如“三○三血案”、“刁刘氏”、“三朵花”之类。有人说不止这个数目，可能还多一些。
    黑龙江开放剧目后也呈现着活跃繁荣的现象。但是像“桃花女”、“杀子报”之类也出了笼，据统计坏的出笼约占十分之一。有些戏虽然不很健康毒性也不大的可以修改。
    坏的剧目经过批评讨论，可以修改。有一点必须提出的，今天的观众和艺人们的觉悟跟以前完全不同了。有的艺人说，旧的剧目中有些不好的词句我们都在改，在以前感觉着没有什么的，在今天就感觉到说不出口。程砚秋先生的拿手好戏“锁麟囊”，过去认为剧本有问题，程先生就和好几位同志一起修改，交给艺术局一位同志，当时程先生并不以为原剧本有什么了不得的问题，剧目开放后那位同志把原剧本送还程先生，认为可以不必修改，可照样上演。但程先生本人，认为某些地方有修改的必要。程先生自己说，他的观点跟过去不同了。
    开放剧目好的作用是主要的，百花齐放百家争鸣还应当进一步加以贯彻。老实说，如果百花齐放的方针不提出，“五四”以来的剧目就没人敢上演。
    百花齐放的方针，有的地方执行得好的就大胆地放了；有的是嘴里说放，但怕放了出毛病就不敢放；有的就放得少，作为有条件、控制着放；有的就完全没有放。多数同志认为现在放和鸣都还只是一个开头，应当继续放。小心谨慎加以控制就等于不放。我认为还是应当大胆地放。
    关于为工农兵服务的方向，可以说没有任何一个剧团不高兴为工农兵服务。不管是公营私营的话剧、歌剧、戏曲、舞蹈等演出团体，没有不下厂下乡的，尤其是各地方中小型的戏曲剧团，他们的生活离不开工人和农民。即使是大都市的话剧团体，他们经常接触很多观众，每年也还是有一定的时间为工厂为郊区农村（有时还到更远的地方）也有时为部队演出。——当然有的下去得多，有的下去得少——有人说城市里的剧团只在剧场、排演场、宿舍三个地方转，这不完全是事实。再说，剧场艺术的建立和工农兵方向并没有矛盾。
    有些戏曲剧团下乡，在某些地区往往受到不合理的限制，有个别地区还保持着对艺人轻视歧视的封建思想，甚至于有需索陋规（例如强迫送票之类），行凶殴打任意侮辱的事。所以有某几个地方剧团表示说：“并不希望国家津贴，只希望少送红票，多演几次戏。”尤其是民间职业剧团受限制最大。当然有许多地区领导思想正确，就没有那些不合理的现象，或者少一些。
    有人说旧的东西太多了，发掘整理的工作可以适可而止，我认为发掘整理的工作还做得很不够，如何接受遗产、发扬传统，工作还多得很，还需要我们做长期的努力，不能限期克日完成。整理旧的并不妨碍创造新的，而且对发展新的有帮助，并不能因为新的创作写不出来，就归罪于整理旧的。对新的东西我们要大力扶持，应当采取积极的办法加以鼓励，不能粗暴对待。
    中国的话剧运动，一开始就跟政治运动密切结合着，五十年来建立了中国的话剧艺术，不仅在艺术上有很大的成就，在政治斗争中，也取得了很大的胜利。自从我们学习了苏联的先进经验，学习了斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系，基本上已经能掌握社会主义现实主义创作方法。但是也有生硬地搬用教条的缺点，在创作思想方面，多多少少引起了一些混乱，但这种现象绝不能归罪于斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系，只是由于硬搬而产生了偏向。我们正在纠正这种错误，相信这是不难纠正的。
    在艺术界一般说来似乎比其他部门平静无事，但事实上，吹皱一池春水的风也不是完全没有，总而言之内部的矛盾也还是相当复杂的。但是必须注意，我们是国家的主人，就应当拿出当家作主的态度，为祖国团结一切可能团结的力量。我们应当发挥我们的主观能动性，主动地用种种方法解决矛盾，决不宜以个别人对个别事件的情绪，混淆思想。我们只要根据主席指示的分清是非的精神，加以贯彻是完全可以做到的。
    最后我想思想领导、思想教育工作非常重要。改造思想是要经过长期的努力的。我们应当加强辩证唯物主义的学习，不仅从书本子上，主要是从生活当中、工作当中、从人与人的关系当中，深刻地加以体会。另一方面，中国也有各方面的专门家，包括艺术家在内，我们对这些专家和学者，应当给与更多的尊重和帮助。一般地说，现在不要求进步的纵有也还是极少数，可是对那些专家学者们，我们不宜要求得太多，还不宜挤得太紧。主席告诉我们思想工作是不能够用粗暴的方法对待，不能够用行政命令来进行。我们只要不停，也就不必太急。我想毛主席说的每天洗脸、每天扫地这个比喻对我们每个人都是很有益处的。
