　　Jiangxi Camphor Factory Increases Production Without Increasing Manpower
　　(Our report) Jiangxi Camphor Factory has achieved "increased production without increasing manpower" as a result of its efforts to tap the potential of the enterprise. The factory's actual total output value in 1956 exceeded the original plan by 27.58%, an increase of 42.55% compared to the previous year. Despite such a significant increase in production, not only was there no increase in personnel, but the average total number of employees in the factory decreased by 2.7% compared to the previous year. There was also no increase in major production equipment.
　　The reason for the factory's production growth is the result of relying on the wisdom of the masses, continuously improving production technology, and tapping potential: First, learning and promoting advanced experiences. Last year, the factory sent personnel to the Shanghai Jiafu Factory to learn the experience of "batch distillation" and promoted it in combination with the factory's own situation. At first, the batches were too many, and the number of repetitions increased, resulting in a decrease in daily output. After repeated experiments and continuous improvements, they finally achieved success. The camphor extraction rate increased from 18% last year to 22.72%, increasing the value by nearly 40,000 yuan. It also saved a lot of raw materials. Second, fully utilizing the capacity of existing equipment. The factory's method of producing light oil originally involved pouring the raw material camphor oil into a pit and directly sucking it into a distillation pot for heating and production. Under the call of "completing the Five-Year Plan in four years," employees used their brains to convert the original copper pot used for storing oil into a preheating pot. A motor was used to pump the cold camphor oil from the pit into the preheating pot for initial heating before being put into distillation production. As a result, the production operation time of the distillation pot was reduced from two and a half hours per pot to one hour and thirteen minutes, and the daily output increased from 12,210 kilograms to 1,898 kilograms. The preheating method was also used in camphor production, increasing the output by 20%. Third, continuously improving operating methods. The factory has three distillation pots, and the oil change for each pot is not synchronized, with each oil change taking about 22 minutes. Later, the "same suction and same discharge" operation method was adopted, which only takes nine minutes.
　　The fact that the Jiangxi Camphor Factory increased production last year fully demonstrates that it is possible to achieve "increased production without increasing manpower" in some enterprises. The key lies in strengthening production management with improved technology as the core, giving full play to the wisdom of the workers, and using scientific methods to improve equipment and operating methods. In this way, it is entirely possible to achieve increased production.

### 江西樟脑厂增产不增人

　　江西樟脑厂增产不增人
    本报讯　江西樟脑厂由于努力挖掘企业潜在能力的结果，做到
  “增产不增人”。这个工厂1956年实际总产值超过原订计划27.58％，比去年实际增加42.55％。生产增加这样多，不但没有加人，而全厂平均职工总人数却比去年减少2.7％。主要生产设备，也没有增加。
    这个厂生产的增长的原因，是由于依靠群众智慧、不断改进生产技术和挖掘潜力的结果：第一、学习和推广先进经验。去年该厂派员到上海嘉福厂学习“分批分镏”的经验后，结合本厂情况加以推广。起初分批过多，反复次数增加，日产量反而下降；经过反复试验，不断改进，最后终于获得了成功，出脑率由去年的18％提高到22.72％增加价值近四万元。并且还节约了很多原材料。第二、充分利用原有设备能力。这个厂生产光油的方法，原来是将原料樟油倒入地坑，直接吸入蒸镏锅内加温生产。在“五年计划四年完成”的号召下，职工开动脑筋，利用原来存放油的紫铜锅改为预热锅，用马达将地坑内的原料冷樟油抽进预热锅，先加一次热，再投入蒸镏生产。因此，减少了蒸镏锅的生产作业时间，由过去的每锅二小时半缩短到一小时十三分，日产量由一万二千二百一十公斤，提高到一千八百九十八公斤。在樟脑生产方面也同样采用了预热办法，增加了产量20％。第三、不断改进操作方法。该厂有三只蒸镏锅，每口换油是不同时的，每换一次油需二十二分钟左右。后来采用“同吸同放”的操作方法，只要九分钟就够了。
    江西樟脑厂去年增产的事实，充分说明在一些企业中可以做到“增产不增人”。关键的问题在于加强以提高技术为中心的生产管理工作，发挥职工群众的智慧、用科学的办法来改进设备、改进操作。这样，达到增加产量是完全可能的。
