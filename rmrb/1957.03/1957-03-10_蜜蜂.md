Bees
    Zhuge Qun

    A few days ago, newspapers reported on Soviet agronomists' experiments: bee pollination can greatly increase crop yields, for example, increasing sunflower production by 25% to 30%, and cucumber production by three to four times. Of course, the merits of bees are not limited to this; they can also produce large quantities of honey and wax. Modern beekeeping technology has improved, and honey income has also greatly increased. Just look at the recently opened National Agricultural Exhibition; units such as the Hubei Jinshui Farm and the Liaoning Jinzhou Livestock Farm can harvest more than three to four hundred catties of honey per hive each year.

    Everyone knows that there is a "queen bee" in every bee colony. In fact, she is just the mother of a group of bees. A few days after birth, she goes out to mate with drones once, and then spends her entire life in the hive busy laying eggs. During the busiest times, she can lay two to three thousand eggs a day. The weight of these eggs is greater than her own weight.

    The bees that truly run the household are called "worker bees." They are the most numerous, with as many as eighty or ninety thousand in a large colony, and at least several thousand in a small one. What we usually talk about and see are none other than these bees. They are not fully developed, have no sexual desire, but have a high enthusiasm for work, and are responsible for all the work in the bee colony. Worker bees that are only one or two days old take on the work of delivering feed and feeding the small bees. Don't underestimate this work, because each egg laid by the queen bee requires them to deliver feed about eight thousand times to raise it into an adult bee. Slightly older worker bees begin to secrete wax to build nests. This is also a hard work, but due to mutual cooperation, a bee colony can often build ten to twenty thousand nest cells in a day and a night. The nest cells are all neat hexagonal shapes, which has greatly surprised mathematicians, because if any other form is used, it cannot be more solid or save more wax than this nest cell. Larger worker bees are responsible for going out to collect. Their collection range is usually within a one- or two-kilometer radius around them. In the south of the motherland, you can now see bees shuttling through the flowers; they buzz and vibrate their wings, stretch out their long proboscis (tongue), nervously sucking nectar, and carry the nectar in their abdominal honey sac back to the nest. The honey sac is not large, and can only carry about 40 milligrams (one thousand milligrams equals one gram) of nectar each time. After returning to the nest, they have to drain about 50% of the water before brewing it into honey. In order to collect and brew one kilogram of honey, bees must collect about eight to ten million flowers and fly a total of about 130,000 kilometers. However, despite the heavy work of collecting honey, due to concerted efforts, bees can still collect a large amount of pollen; for example, a bee colony with 40,000 collecting bees can collect as much as 20 kilograms of pollen a day. When the bees come back from collecting, you can also see rice-grain-sized yellow, purple, or gray things on their legs, which are two clumps of pollen brushed off from their own bodies. It is particularly important to mention that bees have such a characteristic when collecting honey: if there are many kinds of flowers blooming in the wild at the same time, the bees will be divided into groups to collect, and a group of bees will always collect the same kind of flower, and will never change casually. The efficiency of bee pollination is so great, which can be seen from this characteristic; because plants generally can only be fertilized and bear fruit with pollen of the same species. Now, in Soviet agriculture, the method of "training bees" is being used to make bees pollinate according to people's will.

    Worker bees are diligent and tireless throughout their lives, going out to collect honey during the day, and helping to fan their wings for ventilation and brewing honey at night, helping to secrete wax to build nests, until they die. Bees never want to die in the hive, but only die on the way to collect; even their excrement is scattered outside when flying, and never contaminates the inside of the box. In winter, bees do not fly for several months, and at this time, excrement is stored in the large intestine until spring when they go out to excrete. Bees seem to be particularly hateful of non-working members. If they accidentally encounter a bee that does not work for some reason, they will quickly drive it out of the box without mercy. If there are enemies (rats, wild bees, honey-stealing bees, etc.) that invade, once discovered by the bees guarding the gate of the box, they will immediately bravely resist in groups. Therefore, beekeepers are very afraid of mutual theft among bees, because at this time, bees often bite and kill each other, leaving none behind.

    Although bees are so unforgiving of non-working companions, they show great sympathy for their companions when food (honey and pollen) is insufficient. If there is insufficient food, they will fairly distribute the food. Bees near the food will never take advantage of their position to eat and drink excessively, and bees far away from the food will never eat less. Because of this, even if there are tens of thousands of bees in the same bee colony, there is never any competition for food or fighting.

    Finally, I have to talk about the interesting but pitiful "drones." There are hundreds to thousands of drones in spring and summer. They are large in size, and except for rushing to the love field in spring and summer and chasing virgin queens, they do nothing. It has no sting at the end, so it has no part in resisting enemies. Although bees each form a group and defend strictly, drones can swagger and move freely between groups, enjoying themselves immensely. But good times don't last long. Once the mating season passes, this lazy young master begins to be tired of. At first, the worker bees limit its food; later, they drive it out of the box to freeze to death, or bite it to death, or sting it to death. Usually, none of the drones can live to old age.

    蜜蜂
    诸葛群
    前些天，报纸上报道了苏联农学家的实验：蜜蜂传粉能使农作物大大增产，例如使向日葵增产25％到30％，使黄瓜增产三、四倍。自然，蜜蜂的功劳还不止于此，它们还能生产大量的蜜和蜡。现代养蜂技术进步了，蜂蜜的收入也大大提高了。试看最近开幕的全国农业展览会吧，湖北金水农场、辽宁锦州畜牧场等单位，每群蜜蜂每年可收蜂蜜三、四百斤以上。
    人们都知道，每个蜂群里都有一个“蜂王”。其实，它只是一群蜜蜂的母亲。它出生后几天，外出跟雄蜂交尾一次，以后便一生在蜂群里忙着产卵。挺忙的时节，每天要产卵二、三千颗。这些卵的重量，比它的体重还大。
    真正当家作主的蜂，叫做“工蜂”。它们数目最多，一个群里多的有八、九万，少的也有几千。我们日常所说的和能看到的，都不外是这种蜜蜂。它们发育不完全，没有性的要求，但工作热忱却很高，担负着蜂群里的一切工作。出生刚一、二天的工蜂，就担当起送饲料、喂小蜂的工作。不要小看这件工作，须知蜂王产出来的每颗卵，大约都须它们送进饲料约八千次之多，才能养育成蜂呢。稍大一些的工蜂，开始泌蜡造巢。这也是一桩辛苦的事，不过由于互相合作，一个蜂群常常能在一天一夜里造成一、二万个巢房。巢房一律都是整齐的六角形的，这曾使数学家大为惊讶，因为如果采用任何其他形式，都不能比这种巢房更坚固、更省蜡了。更大一些的工蜂，担负外出采集的工作。它们采集的范围，平常只在一、二公里以内的周围地带里。在祖国的南方，现在你已能看到蜜蜂在花丛中穿梭了；它们嗡嗡地振着翅，伸出长长的吸管（舌），紧张地吸着蜜，把蜜吸到腹部的蜜囊里带回巢去。蜜囊并不大，每次只能装载约四十毫克（一千毫克才等于一克）花蜜，带回巢后，还要排去约50％的水分，才酿成蜂蜜。蜜蜂为了要采集和酿造一公斤的蜂蜜，大概必须采集约八百万到一千万朵花，要飞行共约十三万公里。但是，尽管采蜜工作这样繁重，由于合力同心，集腋成裘，蜜蜂仍能采集大量花粉；譬如说，一个拥有四万采集蜂的蜂群，一天采得的花粉，就可多达二十公斤。蜜蜂采集回来时，在它的两腿上，你还可看到米粒般大的黄色或是紫色、灰色的东西，那就是两团从它自己身上刷下来的花粉。这里特别要提一下，蜜蜂采蜜时有这样一种特性：如果野外同时有很多种花开着，蜜蜂便会分组去采集，一组蜜蜂始终采着同一种花，决不随便改换。蜜蜂传粉效率所以有那么大，从这特性已可看出；因为植物一般只有用同种的花粉才能受精结实。现在，在苏联的农业中，已在用“训练蜜蜂”的方法，使蜜蜂按照人的意志传粉了。
    工蜂一生勤劳不息，白天外出采蜜，晚上还帮助扇翅通风和酿蜜，帮助泌蜡造巢，直到死了为止。蜜蜂从来不肯死在蜂箱里，只死在采集途中；甚至它们的排泄物，也是在飞行时撒在外边，决不沾污箱内。在冬天，蜜蜂有几个月不飞行，这时排泄物就贮积在大肠里，直到春天才外出排泄。蜜蜂对不工作的成员好像特别仇恨，如果偶然碰见有某种原因而不工作的蜂，它们就迅速把它赶出箱外，毫不留情。如果有敌人（鼠、野蜂、盗劫的蜜蜂等）侵害时，一被守卫箱门的蜜蜂发现，它们会立刻奋不顾身，合群抵抗。所以养蜂人挺怕蜜蜂发生相互的盗劫，因为这时蜜蜂常常咬杀得一个不剩。
    蜜蜂对不工作的同伴虽然那样不原谅，但在食料（蜜和花粉）不足时，却对同伴表现出莫大的同情心。要是食料不足，它们也会把食料公允地分配，近在食料旁边的蜂，决不利用地位大吃大喝，远离食料的蜂也决不少吃一些。正因为这样，在同一蜂群里，那怕有数以万计的蜂，也从不发生争食互殴的事。
    最后还得说说有趣而又可怜的“雄蜂”。雄蜂在春夏季约有几百到几千个，身体硕大，除了春、夏间骋驰情场、追逐处女王外，就无所事事了。它尾端没有刺，所以连抵抗敌人的事它也没份儿。虽然，蜜蜂各自为群，防守森严，然而雄蜂却可大模大样，在各群间来往自如，乐得不可开交。可是好景不常，交尾季节一过去，这位懒公子便开始被厌倦了。起先，工蜂们限制它的食料；以后把它逐出箱外冻死，或者咬死、刺死，通常，雄蜂是没有一个能够度到衰老而死的。（附图片）
