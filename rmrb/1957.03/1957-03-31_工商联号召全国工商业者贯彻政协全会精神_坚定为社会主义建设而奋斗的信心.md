Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce called on industrialists and businessmen nationwide to implement the spirit of the Third Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in all their work.

The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, in its "Instructions to Industrialists and Businessmen Nationwide to Strive to Implement the Spirit of the Resolutions of the Third Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC," issued on the 27th, stated that industrialists and businessmen nationwide must correctly understand the current domestic and international situation, which is favorable to our country's construction, and further strengthen their confidence in striving for socialist construction.

The instructions pointed out that this year's campaign to increase production and practice economy has significant importance. Many industrialists and businessmen possess certain technologies and knowledge in production and management, are capable of careful calculation, and are good at tapping production potential. Therefore, they must promote the spirit of patriotism, study diligently, run enterprises thriftily, utilize past experiences, overcome the various difficulties in current production and management, and make significant achievements in the socialist emulation campaign centered on increasing production and practicing economy. Increasing production and practicing economy is not only a matter for enterprises but should also be implemented in daily life. Industrialists and businessmen should further cultivate a hardworking and simple lifestyle, economize on consumption, and purchase public bonds and implement savings according to their capabilities. This will not only help the country's economic construction but also benefit self-transformation.

The instructions also pointed out that in order for industrialists and businessmen to play a greater active role in socialist construction, they must further strengthen their studies, correctly understand the consistency between national interests and individual interests, and gradually change their old standpoints, views, and methods. The Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government regard policies such as "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," "Long-term coexistence, mutual supervision," "Strengthening political and ideological education," and "Overall planning, appropriate arrangements" as methods to resolve internal contradictions among the people and achieve further unity within the people. Industrialists and businessmen should correctly understand the spirit of the Party and government's policies, overcome arrogance and complacency, relax their transformation and all other negative emotions, fully exert their initiative and creativity in their work, further establish the idea of being masters of their own affairs, actively put forward rationalization proposals with a responsible attitude, carry out criticism and self-criticism, exert the role of people's supervision, and make more and greater contributions to socialist construction. The instructions require industrialists and businessmen to constantly use the five basic principles unanimously adopted by the Second Members' Representative Assembly of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce to examine their own thoughts and work, gradually achieving "breaking with capitalism and establishing socialism" to enhance socialist consistency and achieve the goal of a more consolidated unity within the people.

The instructions concluded by saying that industrialists and businessmen nationwide must earnestly study the important documents and resolutions of the Third Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC and actively respond to the call of the meeting.

　　工商联号召全国工商业者贯彻政协全会精神
　　坚定为社会主义建设而奋斗的信心
    据新华社28日讯  中华全国工商业联合会号召全国工商业者要把中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第三次会议的决议精神，贯彻到各项工作中去。
    中华全国工商业联合会在27日发出的“全国工商业者为贯彻人民政协第二届第三次会议的决议精神而奋斗”的指示中说，全国工商业者必须正确地认识当前国内外对于我国建设有利的形势，进一步坚定为社会主义建设而奋斗的信心。
    指示指出，今年的增产节约运动有着重大的意义。不少工商业者对于生产经营具有一定的技术和知识，能够精打细算，善于挖掘生产潜力。因此必须发扬爱国主义精神，刻苦钻研，勤俭办企业，利用过去的经验，克服当前生产经营中的各种困难，在以增产节约为中心的社会主义竞赛运动中作出显著的成绩。增产节约不仅是企业的事情，同样应该贯彻到日常生活中去。工商业者应该进一步养成勤劳朴素的生活作风，节约消费，按照各人的可能，将现金购买公债和实行储蓄。这不仅有助于国家的经济建设，同时也有利于自我改造。
    指示还指出，工商业者为了在社会主义建设中能够发挥更大的积极作用，必须进一步加强学习，正确地认识国家利益和个人利益的一致性，逐步改变旧的立场、观点和方法。中国共产党和人民政府把“百花齐放、百家争鸣”、“长期共存、互相监督”、“加强政治思想和教育工作”、“统筹兼顾、适当安排”等政策，作为解决人民内部矛盾，达到人民内部进一步的团结的方法。工商业者应该正确地体会党和政府的政策精神，克服骄傲自满，放松改造等一切消极情绪，在工作岗位上充分发挥积极性和创造性，进一步树立主人翁的思想，以认真负责的态度，积极提出合理化建议，展开批评与自我批评，发挥人民的监督作用，为社会主义建设作出更多、更大的贡献。指示要求工商业者必须随时以全国工商业联合会第二届会员代表大会一致通过的五项基本准则，来检查自己的思想和工作，逐步做到“破资本主义，立社会主义”，以增强社会主义的一致性，达到人民内部更巩固的团结的目的。
    指示最后说，全国工商业者必须认真地学习人民政协第二届第三次会议的重要文件和决议，积极响应会议的号召。
