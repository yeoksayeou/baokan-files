　　Huang Yong, Fu Zhengmo, and Peng Jieru said: During our inspection, we saw the mother of Hu Xin, the commander of the Taiwan Armored Forces, Chiang Ching-kuo's maternal grandmother, Mrs. Yao Cong, and Mrs. Xuan Tiewu. We also learned that Chen Cheng's elder sister and others are living well. They all hope that Taiwan will be peacefully liberated as soon as possible so that they can meet their relatives.
　　After listening to Premier Zhou's report on his visit to eleven countries in Asia and Europe and the current international situation, we deeply realized that our country's friendship with these countries is becoming closer day by day, and the socialist peace and democracy camp is becoming more united and consolidated. At the same time, we realized that due to our country's socialist construction achievements, the country's strength has become unprecedentedly strong, and its international status has been unprecedentedly elevated. It makes us feel how fortunate we are to live in this great era.
　　Here, we would like to briefly talk about the situation of visiting some friends and old acquaintances during our inspection in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Zhejiang areas last winter. In Hangzhou, we met Deputy Director Ye Fang (Zhejiang Provincial Forestry Department, commander of the uprising division in Wenzhou). He talked about his recent visit to the old lady of Hu Xin (now the commander of the armored forces in Taiwan) in Gaodianxia, Wenzhou. She is sixty-eight years old this year, in good health, and her family is living well. Her two younger sisters are teaching under the care of the local government. Her old mother's only hope is to liberate Taiwan as soon as possible, so that she can reunite with her children while she is still healthy. We also met with Committee Member Du Wei (Member of the Zhejiang Provincial Political Consultative Conference). He spoke freely about the inspection situation in Zhejiang. In Qingyuan County, he met Chen Cheng's elder sister, old lady Chen Qinhua Xu. Both she and her husband have joined senior agricultural cooperatives. They are very strong and happy. She said that her son is a cadre in the Jinhua County government and is doing a good job. She showed us a draft of the letter she wrote to Mr. Chen Cheng on December 8th last year. She misses her mother and younger brothers (Jingxiu, Mianxiu) in Taiwan very much, and eagerly hopes to meet them soon. We also met with old classmate Xiang Xiongxiao, who is currently a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Political Consultative Conference. He said that he misses his old friends far away in Taiwan, especially his old superior He Yingqin. In Shanghai, we met the wife of Mr. Mao Maoqing. She said that Mr. Mao is currently a member of the Ningbo Municipal Political Consultative Conference. She is grateful to the people's government for their preferential care for their lives. Old Mrs. Mao misses her nephew Chiang Ching-kuo very much. She said that Chiang Ching-kuo is a good boy, very filial, and has national integrity. She said that he hates the Japanese imperialists for bombing his mother to death with planes, and wrote a vow to wash away the blood with blood on his mother's tombstone. She believes that her nephew Chiang Ching-kuo will definitely show his love for the country and the nation and join the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible. We also met with Mrs. Yao Cong, Mrs. Xuan Tiewu, their children, and the families of many Taiwanese friends. They are all living well. Some have joined government agencies or enterprises as cadres, some have joined cooperatives, and some are teachers in schools. In short, everyone has a job arrangement, and some of their children are already members of the Communist Youth League. Everything is very progressive. They feel very satisfied. They said that there is only one thing missing, that is, their relatives are not by their side and are far away in Taiwan. They eagerly hope that Taiwan will be peacefully liberated as soon as possible and that their families will be reunited soon.
　　We would also like to take this opportunity to say a few words to the Whampoa classmates in Taiwan. Because we are all Whampoa students, we have received the revolutionary thought education of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, shared weal and woe, and gone through hardships together. Under any circumstances, we care about each other. You know the situation in Taiwan better than we do. American imperialism wants to turn Taiwan into its territory and wants to support another pro-American faction to replace the Kuomintang authorities. You also know these conspiracies very well. Therefore, more and more military and political personnel in Taiwan, including Whampoa students, have approved of the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and the reunification of the motherland, so as not to continue to be insulted by American imperialism. This is very natural. Our classmates on the mainland can understand the depressed mood of our classmates in Taiwan, and therefore, we are even more convinced that our classmates in Taiwan will take action to relieve the depression in their hearts. Because now the motherland government and people have repeatedly announced and called on the military and political personnel remaining in Taiwan to stand under the banner of patriotism and realize the reunification of the motherland. Especially we Whampoa classmates, we are all believers of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and we are all rich in patriotic thoughts and patriotic enthusiasm. Classmates! The greatest expression of patriotism today is to promote the early realization of the cause of peaceful liberation of Taiwan. We Whampoa classmates control and master the military power of Taiwan. As long as the Whampoa classmates unite and act together, the so-called Taiwan issue will no longer exist. The Chinese solve their own problems, and American imperialism can do nothing about it. Now is the time. We who have studied military affairs certainly understand the comparison of military strength between the two sides. Taiwan has no other way out but the road to peaceful liberation.
　　Let us review again, Whampoa classmates played a certain role in completing the Northern Expedition and defeating Japanese imperialism in the previous two Kuomintang-Communist cooperations. Now, if the efforts of Whampoa classmates can be used again to achieve the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and complete the reunification of the motherland, the revolutionary original intention of Whampoa classmates will be even more gloriously developed. We earnestly hope that you will take action and jointly smash all foreign aggressor forces to build our great socialist motherland. (Attached picture)

### 我们在浙江等地访问和探询了许多台湾朋友的家属

　　我们在浙江等地访问和探询了许多台湾朋友的家属
    黄雍、傅正模、彭杰如说：我们在视察当中，看到了台湾装甲兵司令胡炘的母亲，蒋经国的外祖母，姚琮太太和宣铁吾太太，还得知陈诚的胞姊等都生活得很好。只是他们都盼望台湾早日和平解放，以便能和亲人见面。
    我们听了周总理报告访问亚洲欧洲十一个国家的经过和当前的国际形势以后，深深体会到我国同这些国家的友谊一天比一天亲密，社会主义和平民主阵营更加团结和巩固，同时体会到由于我国的社会主义建设成就，使国家的力量空前的强大了，国际地位空前地提高了。使我们感到生活在这个伟大的时代是何等幸运。
    这里，我们想把在去年冬季到南京上海浙江一带地区视察中访问一些朋友故旧的情形简单谈谈。我们在杭州见到叶方副厅长（浙江省林业厅，在温州起义师长），谈他不久前到温州高店下访问过胡炘（现在台湾的装甲兵司令）的老太太，她今年六十八岁，身体健康，一家人生活得很好，他两个妹妹在当地政府照顾下均在教书，他的老母亲唯一的希望是早日解放台湾，趁她健康的年代里，能够骨肉重团。又见到杜伟委员（浙江省政协委员），他畅谈在浙江视察情况，他在青田县见到陈诚先生的胞姊陈勤华徐老太太，她夫妇俩都加入了高级农业合作社，很健旺，生活愉快；她说她的儿子是金华县的机关干部，工作很好。她拿出她去年十二月八日写给陈诚先生的信的存稿给我们看，她殷切地想念在台湾的母亲和弟弟（敬修、勉修），急切地盼望早日见面。又见到老同事项雄霄，他现任浙江省政协委员，他说他很怀念远在台湾的老朋友，尤其是老长官何应钦。在上海见到毛懋卿老先生的太太，她说，毛老先生现任宁波市政协委员，她感激人民政府对他们的优厚的生活照顾。毛老太太非常想念她的外甥蒋经国，她说蒋经国是个好孩子，很孝道，有民族气节，说他痛恨日本帝国主义用飞机炸死了他的母亲，在母亲坎碑上写着以血洗血的誓词；她相信她的外甥蒋经国一定会表现出爱国家爱民族的行动早日投到祖国怀抱。还见到姚琮太太宣铁吾太太及其子女和许多台湾朋友的家属，她们都生活得很好，有的参加了政府机关或企业部门当干部，有的加入了合作社，有的在学校当教员。总之，每人都有工作安排，其子女中有些已是青年团员，一切都很进步，她们感到很满足，她们说只缺一件，就是亲人不在身边远在台湾，她们迫切地盼望早日和平解放台湾，早日获得家人团聚。
    我们还想借此机会对在台湾的黄埔同学讲几句话，由于我们都是黄埔学生，受过孙中山先生革命思想教育，同过甘苦，共过患难，在任何情况之下，我们彼此之间都是互相关怀的。台湾地方情况，你们比我们知道得更清楚，美帝国主义想把台湾变成它的属地，并且想扶持另一派亲美分子来代替国民党当局，这些阴谋也是你们所深知的；因此，台湾军政人员包括黄埔学生在内已有越来越多的人赞成和平解放台湾，实现祖国统一，免得继续遭受美帝国主义的侮辱，这是很自然的。我们在大陆的同学很能体会在台湾的同学们的苦闷心情，因此，更加相信在台湾的同学们是会采取行动来解除心中的苦闷的。因为现在祖国政府和人民，已一再宣布和号召留在台湾的军政人员们，要站在爱国主义的旗帜下，实现祖国的统一。尤其是我们黄埔同学，都是孙中山先生的信徒，都是富有爱国思想和爱国热情的。同学们！爱国最大表现在今天来说，就是我们促进和平解放台湾的事业早日实现。我们黄埔同学控制和掌握着台湾的军事力量，只要黄埔同学团结一致行动起来，所谓台湾问题就不会存在了，中国人自己解决自己的问题，美帝国主义是无可奈何的。现在是时候了，我们学过军事的人当然懂得双方军事力量的对比关系的，台湾没有别的出路，只有和平解放的一条道路。
    我们再回顾一下，黄埔同学在以往两次国共合作中，完成北伐，打败日本帝国主义起了一定作用。现在如能再次通过黄埔同学的努力，达成和平解放台湾完成祖国统一，黄埔同学的革命初衷便更能光辉地发扬了。我们热切希望你们行动起来，共同粉碎一切外国侵略势力，来建设我们伟大社会主义的祖国。（附图片）
