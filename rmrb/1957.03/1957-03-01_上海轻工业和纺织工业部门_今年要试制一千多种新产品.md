Xinhua News Agency report: This year, one of the goals of the workers in Shanghai's light industry and textile industry departments is to further improve the quality of existing products and increase the variety of new products.

According to recent statistics, Shanghai's dozens of light and textile industry sectors plan to trial produce over a thousand new products this year and increase the number of new designs by over four thousand five hundred.

Among the new products being added are high-end and more precise items, including high-temperature matches, acid and heat-resistant special conveyor belts, tractor tires, and various medical devices utilizing semiconductors. Aureomycin, which previously relied on imports, will also begin mass production in the second half of this year. Economical and practical daily necessities needed by the people include: poplin rainproof cloth, multi-colored nylon wool socks, plastic zippers, folding suitcases, and building blocks for children.

Many old products from Shanghai, which already have large outputs and are popular with domestic consumers, will see further quality improvements this year. The quality of products such as enamel basins, mugs, industrial felt, wool sweaters, and alcohol will approach or reach advanced international standards this year. The rubber industry plans to increase the average mileage of car tires from 25,000 kilometers to over 30,000 kilometers this year without using more raw materials. The clock-making industry also aims to ensure that wooden clocks require no major repairs for ten years and alarm clocks require no major repairs for two years. Products such as batteries and leather are also required to be more durable than in the past, achieving raw material savings through quality improvements.

    上海轻工业和纺织工业部门
    今年要试制一千多种新产品
    据新华社讯  上海轻工业和纺织工业部门职工今年的一项奋斗目标是：老产品质量好了还要好，新产品品种多了还要多。
    据最近的统计，上海几十个轻、纺工业行业，今年要试制的新产品有一千多种，增加的新花式要有四千五百多种。
    在增加的新产品中，高级的、较精密的产品有：高温火柴、耐酸耐热的特种传运带、拖拉机轮胎和好多种利用半导体的医疗器械。过去依靠进口的金霉素，今年下半年也将开始大量生产。人民日常生活中所需要的经济实用的日用品有：府绸防雨布，杂色尼龙羊毛袜，塑胶拉链，折叠皮箱，以及建筑积木等儿童玩具。
    上海许多原来产量很大的深受国内消费者欢迎的老产品，今年也要进一步提高质量。如搪瓷面盆、口杯、工业用毡、羊毛衫、酒精等产品的质量，今年都将接近或赶上国外先进水平。橡胶工业今年就准备在不多用原料的情况下，把汽车轮胎的平均行驶里程，从二万五千公里提高到三万公里以上。造钟业今年也要做到木钟十年不大修、闹钟两年不大修。电池、皮革等产品，也要求比过去经久耐用，从质量的提高中求得原材料的节约。
