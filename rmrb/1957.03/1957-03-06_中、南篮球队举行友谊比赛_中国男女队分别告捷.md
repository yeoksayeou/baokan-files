    China and Yugoslavia Basketball Teams Hold Friendly Matches
    Chinese Men's and Women's Teams Win
    (Our Newspaper) Yesterday evening, the visiting Yugoslavian national men's and women's basketball teams played two matches against the Chinese mixed men's and women's teams at the Beijing Gymnasium. The Chinese men's and women's teams won with scores of 73-62 and 80-35, respectively.
    In these two matches, the Chinese men's and women's basketball teams showed speed, accurate shooting, and good teamwork. The visiting team also displayed skilled center tactics and some clever passes and cross-screen movements.
    In the men's match, the Chinese team used quick breakthroughs, combined with cross-screen mid-range shots, and played very smoothly. The visiting team relied solely on their center, Miletić, who is 1.95 meters tall and weighs 100 kilograms, to score with turnaround shots under the basket. In the first half, the Chinese team led by 22 points with a score of 45-23.
    In the second half, the Chinese team's offensive remained strong, and their lead increased. After the visiting team called a timeout, they changed their tactics, adopting a tight defensive zone, effectively preventing the Chinese team's cuts to the basket. They also took advantage of their 1.95-meter center, Miletić, and forward Kristančić, who scored more than ten points successively under the basket. Finally, the friendly match ended with a score of 73-62. The visiting team's center, Miletić, scored 28 points alone under the basket (16 field goals and 12 free throws).
    In the women's match, the Chinese team immediately adopted a full-court press man-to-man defense. After intercepting the ball, they quickly passed it down the court and scored under the opponent's basket, making the visiting team feel very nervous, which resulted in lineup confusion and passing errors. The visiting team only managed to score some points through center Žuković's turnaround hook shots under the basket. In the end, they were defeated by the Chinese team with a score of 80-35.
    After the game, Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and the Yugoslav Ambassador to China shook hands with the athletes of both countries one by one and took a group photo together. (Guo An)

    中、南篮球队举行友谊比赛
    中国男女队分别告捷
    本报讯　昨日晚上，应邀来我国访问的南斯拉夫国家男女篮球队在北京体育馆内对我国男女混合队，进行了两场比赛。我国男女队分别以七十三比六十二和八十比三十五获胜。
    我国男女篮球队在这两场比赛中，表现得速度快、投篮准和默契好。客队也表现了熟练的中锋战术和一些巧妙的传球、交义掩护动作。
    男子队比赛开始，中国队以快速的突破，配合交义掩护作中距离投篮，打来得心应手；客队只是依靠身高一公尺九十五公分、体重一百公斤的中锋米莱提奇篮下转身投篮得分。上半时中国队以四十五比二十三的比数领先二十二分。
    下半时，中国队的攻势仍很旺盛，比分越发领先。客队叫停以后，改变了战术，改用紧缩防守区域，以密集的防守有效地阻止了中国队的篮下切进，并且利用一公尺九十五公分的中锋米莱提奇和前锋克利斯坦契奇接连在篮下得了十多分，最后以七十三比六十二结束这场友谊比赛。客队的中锋米莱提奇一个人在篮下得了二十八分（投中十六分，罚中十二分）。
    女子队的比赛，中国队一开始便采用了紧逼人盯人的打法，在一截得球后，三传两递，便在对方篮下托入，使客队感到很紧张和因此产生了阵容混乱、传球失误等，客队仅是利用中锋左柯维奇在篮下转身勾手投篮得了不少分，最后以八十比三十五受挫于中国队。
