Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 25th. The survey of three highways leading to the southern region of the Tibetan Plateau is about to begin. These three highways are from Xigaze to Nyalam, Rawu to Zayu, and Quxu to Gyangze, with a total length of approximately 900 kilometers.

	Five survey teams from the First Branch of the Highway Survey and Design Institute of the Ministry of Communications, in cooperation with some engineering and technical personnel from the Tibet Transportation Bureau, departed from Lhasa on the 24th. They will complete the survey of the aforementioned highway lines before the end of this year, and also produce the design engineering for the Rawu to Zayu highway.

	Nyalam is located southeast of Xigaze, between Mount Everest and Mount Gosainthan. After the highway from Xigaze to Nyalam is opened to traffic, farmers and herdsmen in the Himalayan region will be able to obtain daily necessities more conveniently. Zayu is located in the high mountains and ridges in the southeastern part of the plateau, and is a rich multi-ethnic region. The opening of the highway from Rawu on the Sichuan-Tibet Highway to Zayu will be of great significance to the development of this region. The highway from Quxu to Gyangze is a section of the ancient trade route between Lhasa and Yadong. It starts from Quxu on the Lhasa-Ze Highway, turns to Gyangze at the Dazhuka ferry on the Lhasa-Xigaze Highway along the south bank of the Yarlung Zangbo River, so that Lhasa to Gyangze does not have to detour through Xigaze, which can shorten the journey by more than 170 kilometers.

　　西藏高原南部三条公路即将开始测量
    新华社拉萨25日电　通向西藏高原南部地区的三条公路即将开始测量。这三条公路是日喀则到聂拉木、然乌到察隅和曲水到江孜，共长约九百公里。
    交通部公路勘察设计院第一分院的五个测量队，在西藏交通局一部分工程技术人员配合下，已在24日从拉萨出发，他们将在今年年底以前完成上述公路线的测量，并且做出然乌到察隅公路的设计工程。
    聂拉木在日喀则东南珠穆朗玛峰与高僧赞峰之间。日喀则到聂拉木的公路通车后，喜马拉雅山区的农民和牧民，就可以更加方便地得到日用品的供应。察隅在高原东南部的崇山峻岭间，是富饶的多民族地区。从康藏公路线上的然乌到察隅的公路通车后，对这个地区的发展意义很大。曲水到江孜的公路，是拉萨到亚东间古商道的一段。它从拉泽公路线上的曲水开始，沿雅鲁藏布江南岸到拉日公路上的大竹卡渡口转向江孜，这样拉萨到江孜就不用绕道日喀则，可缩短一百七十多公里的路程。
