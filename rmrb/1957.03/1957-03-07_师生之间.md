    Between Teachers and Students
    Lian He
    It was half-past four in the afternoon when I finished work and walked out of the hospital building. A traffic policeman was supporting a seven- or eight-year-old child, who came up to me and asked, "Is this the inpatient department?" While I answered "Yes," I was examining the child. The child was really beautiful, with a round face and dimples even when not smiling. If it weren't for the boyish haircut, one would really think it was a little girl. However, the child's dark eyes were shining with worry, as if there was something very important on his mind; he was holding a chrysanthemum in his hand, as well as a small paper package. The traffic policeman pointed at me and said to the child, "Little friend, please ask this auntie to take you there, I'm going back now." After saying that, he turned to leave, but after taking a few steps, he looked back at the child and said, "Don't get lost again when you go back!" The child hummed in agreement and came to my side, looking up at me and begging, "Auntie, please take me to Teacher Hu." There were over a hundred patients in the inpatient department, how could I know which one was Teacher Hu? I couldn't help but frown and ask, "What is Teacher Hu's full name?" He said, "I don't know." "How can you not even know your teacher's name?" The child blushed upon hearing this, lowered his head, and scraped the smooth cement floor back and forth with one small foot. After a while, his little mouth mumbled, "I'm only in the first grade!" I felt a little remorseful and quickly changed my question: "What's your name? Which elementary school do you go to?" "My name is Yang Xiaohong, and I go to Fenghua Elementary School." I saw that he was so anxious that he only cared about stretching his head to look inside the building, and his legs were slowly moving towards the door, so I pulled him to the office and quickly flipped through the list of inpatients and the inpatient directory. Sure enough, there was a patient named Hu Benhua who was admitted last Monday. He was indeed a teacher at Fenghua Elementary School and was staying in Room 6 of the Third Ward. I immediately took Xiaohong there.
    Pushing open the ward door, Xiaohong immediately saw the patient lying on the bed on the east side and shouted, "Teacher Hu!" He ran over like a little bird.
    Teacher Hu struggled to sit up and looked at Xiaohong with great surprise. Xiaohong threw the flowers and the paper package onto the bed, then jumped onto the bed and hugged Teacher Hu's neck, stuttering, "I... I really miss you, I really miss you,... please get well soon." Two tears welled up in Teacher Hu's gaunt eyes as he hugged the child. "Xiaohong, how did you come here!" Xiaohong raised his head, wiped the tears from his face, stared at Teacher Hu for a moment, and became happy, saying, "I wanted to come a long time ago, but I didn't know where it was. Later, I heard Teacher Wang say it was at this hospital in the West Gate. I came here with my mom once and even got a shot here. Today, I forgot the way again, and the policeman uncle brought me here." Teacher Hu listened and hugged Xiaohong even tighter, not saying anything for a long time. Suddenly, Xiaohong struggled to get up, picked up the big chrysanthemum, waved it in front of Teacher Hu, and said, "Teacher Hu, this is for you." Teacher Hu took the flower and smelled it hard a few times, saying, "Xiaohong, you didn't pick it in the schoolyard, did you!" Xiaohong shook his head, shouting, "No, no. Dad bought two pots of big chrysanthemums yesterday, I picked it from there." Teacher Hu said a little angrily, "Don't you cherish the flowers at home?" Xiaohong slipped off the bed, pouting his mouth and saying, "I didn't pick it casually, I asked Dad for it." "Did Dad agree?" "He didn't agree, it wouldn't work!" He squeezed his eyes, revealing a playful look, which made the other patients laugh softly. However, Teacher Hu was still unhappy, saying, "Xiaohong, that's not right, it's such a pity to pick such a good chrysanthemum!" "Teacher, don't you like flowers? You often take us to water flowers!" "I like flowers, but it's not good to pick them! Do you think it can still live?" Xiaohong lowered his head and said nothing, his face full of remorse.
    After a while, Xiaohong picked up the paper package: "And there's this." Teacher Hu took it and looked at it, becoming strange again, asking, "Where did you get these sponge cakes?" Xiaohong turned his back to the teacher and said, "I definitely won't tell you about this." "Did you secretly take them from home?" Teacher Hu's face was a little gloomy. Xiaohong suddenly turned around, stomping his feet and saying, "I don't want to, I don't want to, you're just accusing me!" Teacher Hu pulled Xiaohong to his side and said gently, "Oh, no, no..., I said it wrong." After a while, he asked him again: "Then where did you get them?" Xiaohong said loudly: "I bought them!" "Where did you get the money to buy them?" Xiaohong immediately pouted again and said: "I won't tell you." Teacher Hu tightly squeezed Xiaohong's hand and coaxed in a low voice: "Good boy, tell me!" Xiaohong first bit his lip, and then couldn't help but say: "Every morning when I go to school, doesn't Mom give me three cents to buy snacks? I saved it for several days before I bought these cakes." Teacher Hu covered his face with both hands, and tears streamed from between his fingers. Xiaohong stood there blankly, watching Teacher Hu so sad, and also began to cry. The other patients all held their breath, and even the old coughing patient stopped coughing. I quietly moved a few steps into the room, wanting very much to pick up this lovely child and kiss him. Teacher Hu wiped his hands, picked up the sponge cakes and handed them to Xiaohong, saying, "You eat them!" Xiaohong shook his head, so Teacher Hu had to wrap them up again and put them on the small table at the head of the bed.
    Xiaohong became happy again, climbed onto the bed and sat down, swinging his legs back and forth. Teacher Hu stroked his hair and asked, "Xiaohong, are your grades all good?" Xiaohong hurriedly took out a small notebook from his pocket and said, "I forgot to show you this." Teacher Hu took it and flipped through it, saying, "This month, the monthly evaluation is all fives again!" Xiaohong smiled triumphantly, his two little dimples deepened. ... (Attached picture)

    师生之间
    联和
    下午四点半钟，我刚下班，走出病房大楼门口，一位交通警搀着个七、八岁的孩子走过来问：“这是住院部吗？”我一面答应“是的”，一面端详着那孩子。那孩子长得实在秀丽，脸蛋儿圆圆的，不笑也露出酒窝儿，要不是梳着男式分头，人真以为是个小姑娘呢。不过，孩子乌黑乌黑的眼睛里闪着烦恼的光，好像有什么挺大的心事；手里拿着一朵菊花，还拿着个小纸包儿。交通警指着我对孩子说：“小朋友，请阿姨带你去找吧，我回去了。”说罢返身走了。没走两步又回头望望孩子说：“回去再不要走错啦！”孩子嗯了一声就到我身边来，仰着脸央求我：“阿姨，带我去找胡老师。”住院部一百多个病人，我哪知道什么胡老师呢。我不禁皱了皱眉头，问：“胡老师叫什么名字？”他说：“我不知道。”“怎么连老师的名字也不知道？”孩子听了这话，小脸红了，低着头，一只小脚来回地划着光滑的水泥地面，停一会，小嘴咕噜着：“我才一年级哩！”我倒有点懊悔，赶紧改问：“你叫什么名字？在哪个小学读书？”“我叫杨小红，在丰华小学上学。”我看他急得只顾伸头向房子里面去看，两条腿慢慢往门里移动，就拉着他到办公室，连忙翻了一下住院病人的名册和住院病人一览表。果然，上个星期一有个病人叫胡本华，正是丰华小学的教师，住在第三病房六号。我马上带着小红去了。
    推开病房门，小红一眼看见东边床上躺着的病人，猛地喊一声：“胡老师！”就像小鸟一样飞也似地跑过去了。
    胡老师用力地翻身坐起来，十分惊讶地看着小红。小红把花儿、纸包儿往床上一扔，就纵身上床搂住胡老师的脖颈子，结结巴巴地说：“我……真想你，我真想你，……你快好吧。”胡老师干瘪的眼窝里涌出了两滴泪珠，搂着孩子。“小红，你怎么来啦！”小红抬起头来，揩了揩脸上的眼泪，盯着胡老师看了一回，高兴起来，说：“我早就想来啦，不知道在哪里，后来听王老师说在西门这个医院。这里我跟妈妈来过一次，还打了一针哩。今天走来又忘了路，还是警察叔叔带我来的。”胡老师听着，更紧地搂住小红，好半天不说话。忽然，小红挣扎起来，拿起那朵大菊花，在胡老师面前晃晃，说：“胡老师，送给你。”胡老师接过花用劲闻了几下，说：“小红，不是在校园里摘的吧！”小红直摇手叫着：“不是的，不是的。昨天爸爸买回来两盆大菊花，从那里摘来的。”胡老师有点生气地说：“家里的花就不要爱护吗？”小红溜下床来，噘着嘴说：“我不是随便摘来的，我向爸爸要的。”“爸爸同意吗？”“不同意，不行哩！”他把眼睛一挤，露出顽皮样子，逗得其他几个病人都轻声地笑了。可是，胡老师还是不愉快，说：“小红，这不对呀，这样一朵好菊花摘下来多可惜哟！”“老师，你不是喜欢花嘛，你常常带我们浇花哩！”“我是喜欢花，摘下来就不好啦！你说它还能活吗？”小红低下头，不言语了，满脸懊悔。
    停了一会，小红拿起那个纸包儿：“还有这个呢。”胡老师接过去一看，又奇怪起来，问：“你哪弄来这些鸡蛋糕？”小红转身背着老师说：“这个，我一定不讲了。”“是从家里偷偷地拿来的吧？”胡老师脸色有些沉郁。小红猛地转过身，两只脚直跺说：“我不干了，我不干了，尽赖人！”胡老师把小红拉到身边来，轻轻地说：“哦，不，不……，我说错了。”停一会又问他：“那到底是哪里搞的？”小红大声说：“我买的！”“你哪有钱买呀？”小红马上又咕嘟着嘴说：“我不讲嘛。”“胡老师紧紧捏住小红的手小声哄着说：“好孩子，你讲呀！”小红先咬着嘴，然后又忍不住说了：“每天早上上学，妈妈不是给我三分钱买点心嘛，我积了好几天，才买这蛋糕。”胡老师双手捂住脸，泪水从手指缝里淌出来。小红呆呆地站着，看胡老师那么伤心，也淌起眼泪来了。其他几个病人也都屏住气，连那个老咳嗽的病人也止住咳了。我悄悄地往房里挪几步，很想抱起这个可爱的孩子来亲一亲。胡老师擦了擦手，拿起鸡蛋糕递给小红说：“你吃吧！”小红把头直摇，胡老师只好又包起来放在床头那个小桌子上。
    小红又高兴起来，爬到床上坐着，两条腿来回地晃荡着。胡老师摸着他的头发问：“小红，你功课都好吗？”小红急忙从衣袋里掏出一个小本儿说：“我还忘了拿给你看呀。”胡老师接过来翻了翻说：“这个月，月评又是门门五分哪！”小红得意地笑了，两个小酒窝凹了多深。……（附图片）
