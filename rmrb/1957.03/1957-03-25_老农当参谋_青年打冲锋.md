　　Two Forces

　　Before April of last year, if you went to the "Shanfeng" Agricultural Cooperative in Lulong County, Hebei, and mentioned old farmers, the young people would shake their heads and say, "They're conservative, backward, and stubborn." If you mentioned the youth, the old folks would wave their hands and say, "They're rash and can't do good work." Each held their own opinion, complaining about each other.

　　Why was their relationship so bad? It turns out it was like this: Before the spring planting last year, over a hundred young cooperative members were trained to be technicians for the cooperative. When they promoted the adoption of new technologies, some old farmers would grumble on the side. When the youth implemented sweet potato soaking, the old farmer Zhang Luoqi said angrily, "This is a swindle, you're ruining perfectly good sweet potatoes by boiling them!" At the mention of dense planting of corn, the old farmers would say, "Just wait for large sweet stalks (corn stalks without ears)!" You say "drought resistance," they say "rely on heaven." Back and forth, the old farmers became "conservative and backward" in the eyes of the youth. Sometimes, even when they made correct suggestions for production, some of the youth ignored them. The old farmer Yang Diansheng suggested kicking soil after sowing cotton seeds, but some young women insisted on tamping the soil with their feet. As a result, the cotton seedlings that were kicked came up evenly, while those that were tamped either didn't sprout at all or came up unevenly.

　　Seeing how the youth treated them, and seeing that the cooperative's affairs were mostly handled by the youth, especially with many young men and women becoming cooperative cadres, plus the cold attitude of some township and cooperative cadres towards them, the old farmers thought: Now is the era of the youth, we old folks who are half buried in the ground can't get ahead anymore. We might as well just stay here and do a little when we feel like it, sleep when we're done, and not ask about anything.

　　A Thread

　　Last spring, the cooperative mobilized members to move earthen hills and fill in river bends. In six days, the hills were moved, the river was shifted, and sixty mu of good land was created. Some old farmers were truly happy to see this, and everyone was willing to contribute good ideas to run the cooperative well. However, even saying a word was unwelcome, so even though they had these intentions, they could only keep them bottled up inside.

　　At the beginning of the spring planting season, the cooperative called on every member to use their brains and think of ways to discover fertilizer sources. The old farmer Zhou Shixing had an idea, remembering that Gao Rong's courtyard had sweet potato cellars dug every year. After the cellars were demolished, the four households in the courtyard would pour dirty water and soil into the pits, which accumulated over time and fermented into a pit of good fertilizer. He overcame his concerns and suggested that the cooperative dig out this fertilizer. Sure enough, more than 400,000 jin of good fertilizer were dug out.

　　Zhou Shixing's example made the township Party general branch realize that if the experience accumulated by the cooperative's ninety-plus old farmers could be applied to production, the impact would be tremendous. They immediately convened a general branch committee meeting to discuss how to leverage the production enthusiasm of the old farmers. The meeting reviewed the past erroneous attitudes of township and cooperative cadres, especially young cooperative members, towards the old farmers. It was decided that after the meeting, all general branch committee members would visit the old farmers, humbly listen to their opinions, sincerely admit their mistakes, and ask them to offer more suggestions for the cooperative.

　　The visits began. Zhao Pu, the deputy secretary of the township general branch, first visited Ni Youjin. After explaining his intentions, he received the reply: "Don't bother me anymore, you old codger. I'm useless!" The deputy secretary patiently told the old man: The cooperative belongs to everyone. Only when everyone is of one mind can the cooperative be run well, and only then can everyone live a good life. But now the ones in charge are the young people. Although they can charge into battle, they lack experience and wisdom. If we could have you good 'advisors,' we would have both courage and resourcefulness in production and be sure to win the battle.

　　"Your words are more valuable than our legs running off." These words touched the old man's heart, and the old man happily said: "My land has joined the cooperative, and now I'll give my old bones to the cooperative too!" The other general branch members' visits were also very successful, and the knots in the old farmers' hearts were initially untied.

　　Following this, the Party general branch and the Communist Youth League general branch conducted education on respecting old farmers and learning from old farmers among all Party members, League members, and youth, respectively, and the young cooperative members' thinking was also straightened out.

　　Old Advisors

　　From then on, Shanfeng Cooperative underwent a transformation. Everyone was happy and willing to share what they knew.

　　The eighty-plus-year-old farmer Zhang Zhen, seeing that the earthen hills had been moved and the river bends filled in, thought: No matter how well the land is filled, if dams aren't built, "a toad's pee" will wash the land away again. He suggested to the cooperative that they build some dams to block floods and slow down the water. The cooperative thought this was a valuable suggestion and immediately convened a meeting of old farmers to discuss how to prepare materials, survey, and construct the dams. The old farmers offered many good ideas. Then, the Party and League general branches held meetings of Party members, League members, and young activists, mobilizing them to build the dams. Afterwards, work on organizing labor, quarrying stone, and surveying dam sites began. Zhang Fuquan, an old farmer with experience in building dams, served as the commander-in-chief, and several other old farmers formed a dam-building advisory group. More than 150 young men and women became the main force in building the dams. In this way, they quarried 8,000 cubic meters of stone and built 22 flood-blocking dams and 5 fish-scale dams along the Shajin River, and constructed 140 large and small gully control projects. The entire project took six months, protecting the land downstream of the Shajin River from floods and increasing grain production by more than 30,000 jin in the past year.

　　Old farmers Chen Hai and Ma Yueming, after researching, proposed diverting water through the courtyards. After the completion of this project, it irrigated five mu of corn, with an average yield of 1,558 jin per mu, creating a new record for high-yield mountain corn in Tangshan Prefecture, Hebei Province.

　　These events made everyone in the cooperative realize that only by combining youth and old farmers can the cooperative be run well. All ninety-five old farmers in the cooperative took action, and in the eleven old farmer symposiums alone, they put forward more than one hundred valuable suggestions. The youth worked even harder because they had both new technologies and learned old experiences, becoming production experts. They learned more than twenty kinds of techniques from the old farmers, such as farmland management and fruit tree cultivation. Most young women, due to learning from the old farmers, saw their work points constantly increase along with the improvement of their production techniques. The old farmers interacted with the youth every day, constantly accepting new things, and their thinking also greatly improved. Especially after a year of practice, some new technologies did increase production, so the old farmers also began to believe in new technologies. In this way, the gap between youth and old farmers gradually disappeared.

　　Honor Roll

　　Heaven does not disappoint those who work hard. A year of diligent labor has brought an unprecedented bumper harvest. In 1955, the cooperative's grain averaged 166 jin per mu (the highest annual yield), and in 1956 it reached 324 jin. Shanfeng Cooperative, which had been short of grain for generations, not only achieved self-sufficiency in grain this year but also sold more than 29,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. Forestry, fruit trees, and animal husbandry have also greatly developed.

　　Everyone knows that these achievements are inseparable from the joint efforts of the old farmers and young cooperative members. Therefore, when the cooperative selected labor models, ten old farmers and ten young cooperative members were on the honor roll and received material rewards from the township and cooperative. To celebrate the harvest, people composed this jingle at the time:

　　The Party steers the rudder,
　　The League hoists the sail;
　　Old farmers are the advisors,
　　Youth charge into the fray.
　　To build socialism,
　　Everyone shows their heroism;
　　We can move mountains and overturn seas,
　　Surpassing the Old Fool who moved mountains.

　　老农当参谋　青年打冲锋
　　刘九涛
　　两股劲
    去年4月份以前，如果你到河北卢龙县“山丰”农业社去，一提起老农，小伙子们就摇头说：“又保守，又落后，死脑筋。”一提青年，老头子们也摆手说：“毛毛糙糙，干不出好活计来。”各持己见，相互抱怨。
    为什么他们之间的关系这样坏呢？原来是这样：去年春播以前，全社有一百多名青年社员经过训练当了社的技术员，当他们宣传采用新技术的时候，有些老农就在一边念叨。青年们实行白薯浸种，老农张洛七就有气地说：“这是坑人，好好的白薯都让你们煮坏了！”一提玉米密植，老农们就说：“等着吃大甜秆（不结穗的玉米秆）吧！”你说“抗旱”，他说“靠天”。一来二去，老农在青年们的心目中就成了“保守落后”了。有时候他们虽然对生产提出了正确意见，有些青年也不理了。老农杨殿升建议撒下棉种后用脚踢土，有些青年妇女偏用脚踏土。结果，踢土的棉苗出的齐，脚踏的不是没长出苗来，就是苗出的不齐。
    老农们看到青年这样对待他们，又看到社里的事多是青年们干，特别是不少男女青年当了社干部，加上有的乡、社干部对他们也冷淡，他们就想：现在是青年们的天下，我们这土埋半截子的人，再也上不去摊了，倒不如呆够了干点，干够了睡点，什么也不问了。
    一根线
    去年春天，社里发动社员搬土山垫河套，六天工夫，山搬家，河挪位，垫出六十亩好地。一些老农见了，真是从心眼里高兴，每个人也都愿意出些好主意，把社办好。可是，连说句话都讨人厌，虽有这份心事，也只好闷在心里了。
    头春播的时候，社里号召每个社员都要动脑筋，想办法发掘肥源。老农周世兴脑筋一动，想到高荣的院子里年年挖白薯窖，窖拆了以后，院里的四户人家就往坑里倒脏水和脏土，日积月累，经过发酵，已成了一坑好肥料。他打破顾虑，建议社里挖出这些肥料。果然，一下挖出四十多万斤好肥料。
    周世兴的事例，使乡党总支部体会到，如果把全社九十多名老农积累的经验用到生产上，这作用该有多么大。当天就召开了总支委员会，讨论如何发挥老农的生产积极性，会上检查了过去乡、社干部特别是青年社员对待老农的错误态度。决定会后所有总支委员分头登门拜访老农，虚心听取他们的意见，诚恳承认错误，请他们多为社出主意。
    拜访开始了。乡总支副书记赵普先拜访了倪有金，说明来意以后，得到的回答是：“我这糟老头子，今后别找我了，不中用啦！”副书记耐心地向老人说：社是大家的，只有大家齐了心，才能把社办好，大家才能过上好日子。可是现在出头的都是些青年人，他们虽能够冲锋陷阵，但经验少，智谋浅，如果能有你们这些好‘参谋’，我们在生产上就会有勇有谋，准能打胜仗。
  “你们动动嘴，胜过我们跑断腿。”这些话，句句打动了老人的心，老人欢喜地说：“我的土地入社了，这回我这把老骨头也交给社里吧！”其余的总支委员的拜访也很成功，老农们心里的疙瘩初步解开了。
    接着党总支和团总支又分别向全体党员、团员和青年进行了尊重老农、向老农学习的教育，青年社员的思想也搞通了。
    老参谋
    从此，山丰社变了一个天地，人人都高兴，愿意把自己所知道的东西拿出来。
    八十多岁的老农张珍，看到土山搬家垫好河套以后，他想：地垫得怎么好，要是不修坝，“蛤蟆一撒尿”，地还是被冲跑，他向社建议修一些拦洪缓水坝。社里认为这条意见很宝贵，当时就召开了老农座谈会，研究怎样备料勘测和修建，老农们出了很多好主意。接着党、团总支又分别召开了党员、团员和青年积极分子大会，动员修坝。会后，组织劳力、开山打石、勘测坝址等工作就开始了。对修坝有经验的老农张福全担任了总指挥，加上另外几位老农，就组成了个修坝参谋部。一百五十多名青年小伙子和青年妇女则成了修坝的主力军。就这样，他们开山打石八千方，在沙金河上游修建了拦洪坝二十二道，顺水鱼鳞坝五道，并修建大小谷坊工程一百四十处。全部工程共用了六个月。使沙金河下游的土地免除了水害，去年一年多收粮食三万多斤。
    老农陈海、马月明经过钻研，提出了引水过宅建议。这项工程完成后，浇了五亩玉米，每亩平均产量高达一千五百五十八斤，创造了河北省唐山专区山地玉米丰产新纪录。
    这些事使全社的人都认识到：只有青年和老农结合起来，才能把社办好。全社九十五名老农都行动起来了，仅在十一次老农座谈会上，他们就提出了一百多件大宗的有价值的建议。青年们干活更带劲了，因为他们既有新技术，又学到老经验，就成为生产能手了。他们向老农学会了农田管理、栽培果树等二十多种技术。大多数青年妇女由于向老农学习，随着生产技术的提高，劳动工分也不断增多。老农们整天跟青年打交道，不断接受新事物，思想也大有进步。特别是经过一年的实践，一些新技术确实增了产，所以老农们也都相信新技术了。这样，青年和老农的隔阂就渐渐消除了。
    光荣榜
    天不亏人，一年来的辛勤劳动，换来了从来未有的大丰收。1955年，这社的粮食平均每亩产一百六十六斤（最高年产量），1956年就达到三百二十四斤。过去祖祖辈辈缺粮的山丰社，今年不光粮食达到了自足，还卖给国家余粮二万九千多斤。林木、果树和畜牧等也得到很大发展。
    人人都知道，这些成绩跟老农和青年社员的共同努力是分不开的。所以在社里评选劳动模范的时候，十名老农和十名青年社员都上了光荣榜，分别受到了乡、社的物质奖励。为了庆祝丰收，当时人们编了这样一段顺口溜：
    党掌舵，
    团拉篷；
    老农当参谋，
    青年打冲锋。
    为了建设社会主义，
    人人逞英雄；
    我们能搬山倒海，
    赛过当年的老愚公。
