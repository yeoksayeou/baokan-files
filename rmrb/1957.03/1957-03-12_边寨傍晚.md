Title: Evening in a Border Village

Evening in a border village is enchanting.

The setting sun hangs long on the mountain ridges, and the red silk-like sunlight sprinkles on the well platform and the tips of bamboo… Gold-edged white clouds float in the sky, the rice about to be harvested is golden in the fields, and the cattle, with their bellies full, frolic as they return to the village….

The Dai people who live here are preparing to celebrate their annual "Gan Duo Festival" [Note 1].

This year's "Gan Duo Festival" is happier than usual. The first batch of cooperatives established after the land reform brought people their first harvest in autumn; the heavy, golden ears of grain exude a fragrant aroma, and the sound of the elephant-foot drum brings joy to the people.

The well side at dusk seems very lively, as young Bu Shao [Note 2] girls come out to fetch water in twos and threes. Usually, they fetch water in the morning, but now, they want to choose their partners during this festival. Fetching water is a good opportunity; perhaps they will meet someone who satisfies them at this time. Therefore, girls who don’t usually fetch water also come to fetch a few buckets specially.

The young Bu Mao [Note 3] boys are even more active, all dressed up smartly, waiting early at the well platform. When they see the person they love, they follow her; pulling the girl's water bucket as they walk, they express their feelings. If two or three Bu Mao boys fancy the same Bu Shao girl, they follow her at the same time, "attacking" her. If one or two of them are rejected, they are not jealous at all; on the contrary, they congratulate the successful one. At this time, you can hear such love songs by the well:

	The sun sets in the west,
	The moon rises in the east,
	The moon forever follows the sun.
	The wild geese return to the south,
	With their companions by their side,
	They fly side by side, wing to wing.
	Girl! Since I saw you,
	I can no longer be alone,
	My heart is full of words to tell you,
	But you hide away.
	Ah, girl! Since I truly love you,
	Even if you hide in the bottom of the sea,
	I will turn into a fish and chase you.

Night falls. The sound of the large three-stringed lute floats low and melodiously on the bamboo tips; the sound of the elephant-foot drum vibrates people's heartstrings; a large bonfire is lit in front of the Zhuangfang [Note 4], and people gather here from the forest trails.

In front of the Zhuangfang in Deng Huo Village, it is crowded with happy people. A'tun, a girl who just returned from the peanut field, is busy washing her face and dressing up. She puts on a light red short shirt and a blue-and-white patterned skirt, and inserts a few white pompom flowers in her smooth hair bun. She looked at her attire in the mirror and smiled. She has spent seventeen "Gan Duo Festivals," but never as happy as today. In the past, she toiled all year round and could not even earn a piece of clothing. This year, she earned more than 2,400 work points in the cooperative. She joined the Youth League and was elected as the leader of the women's fertilizer accumulation group. For the first time, she used her clever hands to make a beautiful set of clothes for herself. After dressing up, she hurried towards the Zhuangfang.

The bonfire in front of the Zhuangfang is burning even more vigorously, and people are dancing wildly to the rhythm of the elephant-foot drum. A'tun and the girls sat together, watching the Bu Mao boys dancing wildly by the fire. A young Bu Mao boy stood out from the dance circle, wearing a gray呢hat with a few peacock feathers inserted in the brim, a clean white shirt, and shiny leather shoes. A'tun recognized him at a glance; he was Shuai Xiang, the secretary of the Youth League branch in Jie Dong Township. He is the best worker in the cooperative and a model for leading fertilizer accumulation. A'tun has liked him for a long time, but has never expressed her feelings to him. Shuai Xiang coughed twice, pulled the gray呢hat down, and sang to her:

	The Bu Shao girl opposite, please speak,
	Do you know I come from a distant place,
	Not for the market, nor for a meeting,
	Guess, but I hope your answer will not disappoint me.

A'tun's face turned red, and the other girls pushed her, telling her to answer. She hesitated, stood up, and sang:

	Ge Nong's [Note 5] mood,
	I can guess it all,
	Beautiful roses need water to water them,
	Roses bloom on thorns,
	Someone wants to pick them, but is afraid of getting their hands pricked….

Shuai Xiang smiled happily and continued singing:

	Beautiful roses bloom on thorns,
	The loved one is always in my heart,
	To pick that flower, I am not afraid of pricking my hand,
	Let's go, little Bu Shao, I'll pick that flower for you to wear.

The singing stopped, and there was a burst of laughter from the dance circle, and the sound of the elephant-foot drum rang out again powerfully.

The wild dance attracted the elderly sitting aside, and they also waved their hands and joined the dance circle. The night was deep, but people were still reveling….

Note: [1] A religious festival held from the fifteenth day to the end of October every year. During this festival, the young men and women of this village beat gongs and drums to go to other villages, and the young men and women of other villages must gather to welcome them, light bonfires in front of the Zhuangfang, dance, and sing to choose their lovers. [2] Dai language: girl, [3] Dai language: young man. [4] Buddhist temple also known as Burmese temple. [5] Dai language: elder brother.

    边寨傍晚
    钧龙
    边寨的傍晚是迷人的。
    夕阳长久地吊在山岭，红绸般的阳光洒在井台上、竹梢尖……，嵌着金边的白云在空中飘浮，快收割的稻谷在田野里一片金黄，吃得胀鼓着肚皮的牛群戏闹着，向村寨归去……。
    生活在这里的傣族人民，正在准备欢度他们一年一度的“赶朵节”
  〔注一〕
    今年的“赶朵节”比往常更快乐。土地改革以后建立的第一批合作社给人们带来了第一个丰收的秋天；沉甸甸地闪着金光的谷穗散发着芬芳的香气，象脚鼓的声音给人们带来欢乐。
    黄昏的井边，显得非常热闹，小布少〔注二〕们三三两两地出来担水了。在平时，她们担水是在早上，如今，她们要在这个节日里选择自己的对象。担水，是一个很好的机会，也许在这个时候会碰上个使自己满意的人。所以，平时不担水的姑娘也特地来担上几担。
    小布卯〔注三〕们更是积极，他们都打扮得挺标致，早坐在井台上等着了。看见自己心爱的人，便跟踪而去；拉着姑娘的水桶一面走，一面表示自己的心意。如果两个或是三个小布卯同时看上了一个小布少了，他们便同时跟在她的周围，向她“进攻”，如果其中的一个或两个被拒绝了，他们也毫不嫉妒，相反，还祝贺获得成功的人。这时的井边，你可以听到这样的恋歌：
    太阳落了西山，
    东山又升起了月亮，
    月亮永远跟着太阳。
    大雁回南方来了，
    身边有它的伙伴，
    它们比翼高飞，翅膀接着翅膀。
    姑娘啊！自从我看见了你，
    我就不能再孤单，
    满腹的心里话想对你倾诉，
    你却又躲躲藏藏。
    哎，姑娘！既然，我真心爱上
    了你，
    你藏到海底，
    我也要变个鱼儿把你追上。
    夜幕降临了。大三弦的声音低沉悠扬地在竹梢上飞荡；象脚鼓的声音，震动着人的心弦；庄房〔注四〕前烧起一大堆篝火，人们从林间小道上，向着这里汇聚。
    在等货寨的庄房前，挤满了欢乐的人们，刚从花生地里回来的姑娘阿屯，忙着洗脸打扮起来。她穿上一件淡红色的短衣和蓝地白花的统裙，在梳得光滑的发髻上，插上几朵白色的粉团花。她对着镜子看了看自己的装束，笑了。她已度过了十七个“赶朵节”，但从没有今天快活。过去，她终年劳累，也没能挣到件衣服。今年，她在合作社的劳动中，得到了二千四百多个工分。她参加了青年团，并被选为妇女积肥小组长。她第一次用自己灵巧的手，为自己做了套漂亮的衣裳。打扮完了，她匆匆地朝庄房走去。
    庄房前篝火烧得更旺了，人们踏着象脚鼓的节拍，狂舞起来。阿屯和姑娘们坐在一起，看着火边狂舞的小布卯们。一个小布卯从舞圈中站出来，他戴着灰色的呢帽，帽沿上插着几根孔雀毛，穿着洁白的短衣，油亮的皮鞋。阿屯一眼就认得出来，他是姐东乡团支部书记帅相。他是合作社里劳动最好，又是带头积肥的模范，阿屯很早就喜欢他了，只是没有向他表达过心意。帅相咳了两声，将灰色的呢帽往下拉了拉对着她唱起来：
    对面那个布少请你把
    话讲，
    你可知道我来自很远
    的地方，
    不是为赶集，也不是
    为开会，
    你猜吧，但愿你的回
    答不要使我失望。
    阿屯的脸一下红了起来，别的姑娘推着她，叫她回答，她忸怩了一下，站起来唱道：
    再弄〔注五〕的心情
    我全都猜得到，
    美丽的蔷薇需要水来
    浇，
    蔷薇花开在藤刺上，
    有人想摘她，又怕把
    手刺伤……。
    帅相很高兴地笑了起来，接着唱道：
    美丽的蔷薇花开在藤
    刺上，
    心爱的人常在心上，
    要摘那朵花，我不怕
    把手刺伤，
    走吧，小布少，我摘那朵花给你
    带上。
    歌声停了，舞圈里发出一阵哄笑，象脚鼓的声音又雄壮地响了起来。
    狂欢的舞蹈，吸引了坐在一边的老人，他们也挥动双手，加入舞圈跳起来，夜已深了，人们还在狂欢……。
    注：〔一〕宗教节日，在每年十月十五日到月底。在这个节日里，这个寨的男女青年打着锣鼓到别个寨去，别寨的男女青年必须聚集起来，迎接他们，在庄房前烧起篝火，跳起舞来，用歌唱来选择自己的爱人。〔二〕傣语：姑娘，〔三〕傣语：小伙子。〔四〕佛寺又叫缅寺。〔五〕傣语：大哥。
