I am very honored to have attended the two enlarged Supreme State Conferences and to have heard the kind instructions of Chairman Mao on both occasions. I will certainly follow Chairman Mao's teachings in the future and do all my work well.

I express my complete and heartfelt support for the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and other leaders.

I will now report to the conference on the overview of the work done by the CPPCC in Hechuan City, Sichuan Province, over the past year.

Under the leadership of the Hechuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and under the guidance of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, all of the work of the Hechuan Municipal CPPCC has been proceeding smoothly. Because we frequently maintain contact with the relevant Party and government departments and regularly visit and understand the situation of people from all walks of life, our work has received support and assistance from all sides.

(1) Regarding consultative work: The main methods of consultation are through the Standing Committee attending meetings convened by the Municipal People's Committee, and through the CPPCC convening Standing Committee meetings or inviting relevant parties to hold specialized symposiums. We have consulted on economic reorganization plans for the cotton cloth, new medicine, candy, and general merchandise industries, on measures for lawyers' fee collection, and on resolving the tight meat supply problem. In addition, we have conducted full consultations on the selection of candidates for the CPPCC Vice-Chairman and Standing Committee members, important lists of personnel appointments and removals in government departments, as well as various policies and measures of state organs, major issues in people's political life, major issues within the united front, and draft measures such as laws, decrees, and regulations submitted by state organs for soliciting opinions, and have widely sought opinions from all parties. Because democracy can be fully promoted in consultative work, everyone feels very satisfied and can act in unison to implement decisions after the meetings. In consulting on local affairs, we believe that widely inviting relevant parties to conduct thematic symposiums can collect opinions more widely and is relatively more effective. For example, in the lower quarter of 1956 in Hechuan City, there was a period when the supply of pork and bean-based non-staple foods was once tight, and there were some chaotic phenomena in the market. After our investigation, we learned that some citizens would line up and wait their turn as early as two or three o'clock in the afternoon of the day before, waiting until the next morning to buy meat and go home. This led to the phenomenon of selling queue positions as a profession. The market situation became even more tense and chaotic, and many people suffered losses in terms of their spirit and time. Therefore, we exchanged views with the relevant departments and held an enlarged symposium. We first explained the purpose of the meeting in the notice, requesting the attendees to prepare suggestions or solutions. Those who attended the meeting included not only the responsible persons of the meat, bean sprout, and tofu industries, but also representatives of agricultural cooperatives, street offices, and municipal management committees, as well as the responsible comrades of the food company, the Bureau of Commerce, the Grain Bureau, and the Department of Finance and Trade. Because the matter of consultation was of pressing concern to the attendees, everyone boldly reflected on the problems and put forward many improvement measures. This helped the responsible authorities to better understand the actual situation, and they expressed their willingness to study and adopt the suggestions made. For those who had doubts due to a lack of understanding of the situation, explanations were provided on the spot. For example, the representative of the agricultural cooperative reflected that the sharp decline in the number of pigs in rural areas was due to a shortage of feed, or in some cases, a lack of money to buy pigs. At that time, the representative of the food company replied that in the future, agricultural cooperatives could link up with the company, and the company could be responsible for supplying the necessary feed and money, implementing a system of fixed breeding and fixed purchase. The market price for buying live pigs would be appropriately increased. The issue of pork supply in the market would be resolved by the Municipal Bureau of Commerce and the food company through consultation and the issuance of rationed meat tickets. For tofu and bean sprouts, the Department of Finance and Trade would study increasing the quantity of beans supplied by the grain company. Other items such as chickens, ducks, sheep, fish, and eggs would be allowed to be sold freely in the market, to ensure smooth circulation. In this way, everyone who attended felt very satisfied, and the tense market supply situation was immediately eased.

(2) Regarding the learning situation at the CPPCC's spare-time political school: In accordance with the spirit of the CPPCC Sichuan Provincial Committee's plan to organize people from all walks of life and some industrialists and businessmen to conduct political theory studies within the two years of 1956-1957, and in light of the actual situation in our city, we formulated a specific implementation plan and established a learning committee. The committee consisted of 15 members from the Standing Committee of the CPPCC, the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's Federation, the Communist Youth League, and the Democratic National Construction Association. The Learning Committee has a learning office, which includes a teaching affairs section and a branch of the Industry and Commerce Federation Learning Committee. The main targets of learning are democratic figures above the level of section chief in government departments, as well as representatives from industry and commerce, health associations, research fellows from the Museum of Culture and History residing in Hechuan, provincial people's representatives, ethnic minorities, and religious circles. In order to adapt to the local absorption of middle and upper-class people from society to participate in spare-time political school studies, we conducted in-depth visits to streets, sections, and groups, understood the list of names, solicited opinions from relevant parties, and absorbed those who met the conditions for enrollment. At the same time, we also considered that the students' level of education should not be lower than junior high school, so as not to affect teaching. Based on these enrollment conditions, the Learning Committee considered that there were 82 people in the urban area and 60 people in the townships who met the requirements to participate in spare-time political school studies. In order to solicit their willingness to participate in learning, we prepared a simple registration form including items such as name, gender, age, and position, along with the learning plan, noting that if they voluntarily participated in learning, they should fill in the form and send it to the CPPCC, which would be considered as enrollment. If they did not wish to participate, they did not need to send the form to the CPPCC. Except for a few who could not persist in learning due to old age and frailty, or who had already left their jobs to study, they all registered for enrollment on time. This fully reflects the voluntary nature of learning. In order to take care of the learning of students in rural areas, we also held correspondence courses, regularly sending out lecture notes, documents, and learning newsletters to exchange learning experiences.

Regarding the selection of teachers and counselors: The school hired comrades from government organs, enterprises, and schools with a certain level of political theory to serve as part-time theory teachers, and selected students with a higher level of theoretical understanding and enthusiasm for public service to serve as part-time counselors. Based on this principle, 12 teachers and 4 counselors were hired to take on teaching and counseling work at the school.

Because the theory teachers are mostly responsible comrades from government organs and schools and their professional work is relatively busy, we determined the lecturing teacher according to the content of the lesson when arranging lectures. At the same time as notifying them to prepare, we sent them the relevant reference materials collected by the teaching affairs office and the students' self-study situation on that chapter. Therefore, in general, teachers can prepare lessons based on the actual situation of the students. After class, the students' opinions on the lectures are also reflected to the teachers to help them improve their teaching methods and improve the quality of teaching.

Strengthening the education and training of group leaders and counselors is also an important issue. If the school's counseling work is not done well, students will lack learning methods, and they will feel at a loss in listening to lectures, self-study, and discussion activities. In addition, if the group leaders who lead the learning lack experience, it will inevitably affect the effectiveness of the students' learning. Therefore, the teaching affairs office regularly convenes meetings to not only report on the students' learning situation, but also takes time to study how to be a good group leader and counselor, how to guide students in self-study, and how to guide students to write discussion outlines under the principle of being conscious and voluntary. How should group discussions be held? How should students who do not like to speak be induced to speak bravely and debate freely. Based on our practical experience and the introduction of relevant experiences from various places, we mobilized everyone to discuss, so that they could learn some counseling methods. From the current situation, each group has already explored some ways in these areas, and some groups have even made some achievements.

Because the counselors and group leaders are relatively responsible in their work, students generally learn some basic methods of learning theory, and the atmosphere of bold speech and free debate has gradually been established.

(3) The work of the specialized work groups: According to the situation in our city and the current capabilities of the CPPCC itself, we have established three work groups. The targets of the work groups are: the first group is for culture, education, and health; the second group is for industry and commerce; and the third group is for society, religion, and ethnicity. Before the establishment, our CPPCC drafted an initial draft of the work plan and sent it to CPPCC members and relevant people to solicit opinions, and asked them to decide whether to participate in that work group or not, all on a voluntary basis. As a result, 15 people were willing to participate in the first work group, 23 in the second, and 13 in the third. Each work group established its own organization after its establishment. For example, the first work group organized symposiums in areas where municipal people's representatives were not easily able to collect opinions, and submitted 44 opinions and suggestions to the Municipal People's Congress. The second work group investigated and understood issues such as personnel arrangements in the transformation of private enterprises, the relationship between public and private partnership, and the waste situation in various industries, and continuously summarized and analyzed the situation and opinions one by one, and sent them to the relevant departments for handling. The third work group cooperated with the Municipal Cultural Section to hold mass chess performances, calligraphy and painting exhibitions, visits to and condolences to the families of revolutionary martyrs, sports performances, etc., and regularly visited and understood all relevant events in society. In late October, together with some members of the Standing Committee and municipal people's representatives, they inspected the city's transportation, factories, handicrafts, and department store and textile companies, and put forward some improvement suggestions based on the existing problems in various aspects. Many units have informed our CPPCC of the improvement situation by letter.

In general, our work has achieved some results, more or less. However, there are also many shortcomings, the main ones being that the work is not active enough, and although some problems have been discovered and sometimes reflected, the understanding of the situation is not deep enough, and the resolution of problems is not thorough. We still lack the initiative to consider how to do more work from the CPPCC's own tasks. We are not active enough in reflecting the opinions of the masses of the people. Ideologically, we believe that it is easier to reflect opinions that are based on written records, but we have concerns about reflecting the oral opinions of the masses, fearing that the problems reflected are not comprehensive enough. As a result, some opinions that could be used as reference have not been fully reflected to the relevant units. Now that these shortcomings have been discovered, we must have the confidence to overcome them in the future. Finally, I wish everyone good health and the conference a victorious success.

    一年来合川市政协的工作概况
　　苏汉臣的发言
    我很荣幸地列席了两次扩大的最高国务会议，听到毛主席两次亲切的指示，我今后一定要遵循毛主席的教导，做好我的一切工作。
    我对周恩来总理、李富春副总理、陈叔通副主席和其他首长的报告表示完全衷心的拥护。
    我现在将四川省合川市政协一年来经过的工作概况，向大会作一汇报。
    合川市政协在中共合川市委的领导下和政协四川省委员会的指导下，一切工作进行是顺利的。由于我们对党、政有关方面，经常取得联系，对各阶层人士常加走访了解情况。因此，我们的工作，遂得各方面的支持和协助。
      （一）关于协商工作方面：协商方式，主要是由常委会列席市人民委员会召开的会议，和本会召开常委会议或邀请有关方面人士举行专业座谈会。我们协商了棉布、新药、糖果、百货等等行业的经济改组方案，律师征费办法，解决肉类供应紧张问题。其他，如协商政协副主席及常委人选、政府部门人事任免的重要名单，以及国家机关的各项政策措施，人民政治生活中的重大问题，统一战线内部的重大问题，国家机关提出的征求意见的法律、法令、条例等措施草案，都进行了充分的协商，并广泛征求各方面的意见。由于在协商工作中，能够充分的发扬民主，大家都感到很为满意，会后都能行动一致地去贯彻实行。在协商地方事件中，我们认为广泛邀请有关方面人士来进行专题座谈，更能广泛收集意见，比较速效。例如，合川市在1956年的下季度，有段时期中，猪肉及豆类副食品的供应，曾经一度紧张，市场上有些紊乱现象。经我们了解，部分市民，多有在头一天的午后二、三时，就排队守起轮子，候到次晨，方才割肉回家。于是就产生了以卖轮子为业的现象。市场情况，因而更形紧张和紊乱，许多人的精神和时间，都受到损失。遂向各有关部门，交换意见，举行了一个扩大座谈会。并先在通知上，说明了开会事由，要求与会人士，准备建议意见或解决办法。出席这个会议的，不仅有肉类、豆芽、豆腐等行业的负责人，还有农业社、街道办事处、市管会的代表，食品公司、商业局、粮食局、财贸部等机关的负责同志。由于协商的事为到会人士所迫切关心，大家反映问题也就大胆，并提出很多改进办法。这样就帮助了主管机关，能更多地了解实际情况，对所提出的建议表示愿意研究采纳；对某些由于因不了解情况而产生怀疑的人，即时进行了解释。例如，农业社代表反映，农村猪只锐减原因，是由于饲料欠缺，或有的是莫钱买猪。当时就有食品公司代表同志答复，今后农业社可以与公司方面挂钩，需要饲料和钱，公司能够负责供应，实行定养、定购的办法。收买毛猪，市价酌予增加。市场猪肉供应问题，由市商业局和食品公司，协商制发定量供应肉票。豆腐、豆芽方面，由财贸部与粮食公司研究供应豆子的增加数量。其余如鸡、鸭、羊、鱼、蛋等类，实行自由市场，要做到交流畅通。这样一来到会的都感到很为满意，市场供应紧张情况，遂立即缓和下来。
      （二）关于政协业余政治学校的学习情况：根据政协四川省委员会，关于1956—1957两年内，组织各界人士和一部分工商业者，进行政治理论学习的规划精神，结合我市实际情况，制定了具体贯彻的实施计划，成立了学习委员会。以本会常委、市委宣传部、市工会、妇联、青年团、民建会等单位为委员，共计十五人。学委会下有一个学习办公室，内设教务处和工商联学委分会。学习的对象主要为政府科局长以上的民主人士，和工商界、卫协会以及住在合川的文史馆研究员、省人民代表、少数民族、宗教界有代表性人士。为了适应当地吸收社会上中上层人士，参加业余政治学校学习，我们曾深入街道、段组走访，将了解名单、征求有关方面的意见，吸收其中合符条件的入学，同时还考虑到学员文化程度，不得低于初中水平，以免影响教学。基于这些入学条件，经学委会研究，认为合符到业余政治学校学习的在市区有八十二人，乡镇有六十人。这些可以参加学习的学员，我们为了征求他们是否愿意参加学习，在方式上，制送包括姓名、性别、年龄、职务等项简单的登记表，连同学习计划，注明如果自愿参加学习，就在表内填写，随即将表寄会，就算报名入学，如不愿参加就不必将表寄会。除个别因年老体衰，不能坚持学习或已经离职学习外，他们都是按期报名入学。这样做充分地体现了学习自愿。为了照顾乡区学员的学习，我们还举办了函授，按期发寄讲义文件和学习简讯刊物，借以交流学习经验。
    关于教员辅导员的人选方面：由学校聘请机关、企业、学校中有一定政治理论修养的同志担任兼职理论教员，并选拔理论水平较高、热心公务的学员担任兼职辅导员。根据这个原则，聘请教员十二人，辅导员四人，分别担任学校教学和辅导工作。
    因为理论教员多系机关学校负责同志兼任，他们的业务工作较忙，我们在安排授课时，根据课文内容，确定讲课教员，在通知他准备的同时，送上教务处所收集的有关参考资料，和学员对这一章节的自学情况。因此，一般教员备课时，都能根据学员的实际情况出发。课后并将学员对讲课的意见，反映给教员，来帮助他们改进教学方法和提高教学质量。
    加强对小组长辅导员的教育培养工作，也是一个重要问题。如果学校辅导工作做得不好，学员就缺乏了学习方法，在听讲、自学、讨论等活动，就会感到头绪茫然，加之领导学习的小组长又缺乏经验，必定就会影响学员们学习的效果。因此，由教务处，经常召集他们开会，在会上不仅汇报学员的学习情况，同时还抽出一定的时间，来研究如何当好小组长、辅导员，怎样引导学员自学，怎样辅导学员在自觉自愿的原则下，来写发言提纲，小组讨论会应该怎样开？对不爱发言的学员应该如何来诱导他勇于发言和自由争辩。根据我们的实际体会，和各地有关这方面的经验介绍，发动大家讨论，使他们能学到一些辅导方法，从目前情况来看，各小组在这些问题上，已经摸索到了一些门路，个别小组中，还作出了一些成绩。
    由于辅导员和小组长的工作比较负责，一般学员都学得一些学习理论的基本方法，大胆发言、自由争辩的风气，已逐渐的树立起来。
      （三）专门工作组的工作：根据我市情况及目前我会本身力量的可能，成立了三个工作组。工作组的对象，第一组是文教、卫生，第二组是工商界，第三组是社会、宗教、民族。成立前由我会拟就工作计划初稿，分送政协成员及有关人士征求意见，并请他们根据自愿情况来决定参加那一工作组或者不愿参加，全属自愿。结果，第一工作组乐意参加的有15人，第二工作组有23人，第三工作组有13人。各个工作组成立后都健全了自己的组织。如第一工作组，针对市人民代表不容易收集到的意见的地方，组织了座谈会，向市人民代表大会，提出了四十四条意见和建议。第二工作组关于对资改当中的人事安排、公私共事关系等问题，并进行调查了解，各行业中的浪费情况，贯彻增产节约，不断的将情况和意见一一归纳，进行分析研究后，送有关部门办理。第三工作组配合市文化科举行了群众性的象棋表演赛、书画展览、慰问军烈属、体育表演等，对社会上一切有关事件经常走访和了解。并于十月下旬会同部分常委和市人民代表视察了全市交通运输工厂手工业及百货纺织等公司，并针对各方面存在的问题提出了一些改进意见，不少单位已将改进情况函告我会。
    总的说来我们的工作或多或少是取得有一点儿的成绩。但是缺点也就不少，主要的是工作不够主动，有些问题虽然发现了有时也反映了，但对情况了解不够深透，解决问题不彻底，尚欠主动地从政协本身的任务来考虑如何多作一些工作。对反映人民群众的意见还不够积极，在我们思想上认为有书面根据的意见好反映，惟独群众口头的意见反映起来有顾虑，耽心反映的问题不够全面。这样，有些可资参考的意见未能全面向有关单位反映。以上这些缺点，既经发现，今后我们一定要有信心来加以克服。末了敬祝各位健康和大会胜利成功。（附图片）
