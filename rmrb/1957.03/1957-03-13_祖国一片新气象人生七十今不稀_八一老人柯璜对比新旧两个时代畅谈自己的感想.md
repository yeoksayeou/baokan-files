I listened to the reports of the responsible leaders and the speeches of everyone in their respective positions. With the most pleasant mood, my whole body was excited, reflecting ten thousand points of encouragement and joy. I come here to offer a few words to the assembly.

I am a small intellectual from the old era, having lived in this world for eighty-one years. From the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty (1877 AD) to the Xuantong Xinhai Revolution; from the Xinhai Revolution to 1949 AD, when the People's Liberation Army liberated the whole country, I transitioned from the old era to the new era. What I heard and saw was, on one hand, infinite pain and sorrow, and on the other, endless joy and excitement. My state of mind before and after is like two different people, as if separated by lifetimes. I will tell everyone present about this.

When I was young, I read a few Confucian classics. Later, when I came into contact with society and read newspapers, I felt that the world was so chaotic and dark. When I was young and strong, and my knowledge had grown somewhat, I saw some unreasonable practices of the officials at the time. And the local bullies, despots, and ruffians were everywhere. I then thought of the "Li Yun," thought of the "Great Learning" and the "Doctrine of the Mean," thought of the "Airs of the States" and the "Hymns," and often had a kind of infatuated, fantastical idea, envying the prosperous and peaceful times of ancient times, the golden ages of Huangdi, Yao, Shun, and Yu. The world is clearly a wheel moving forward, how can it be turned backward! How can we allow a replay of history!

In 1911, Mr. Sun Yat-sen launched the national democratic revolution and created the Republic of China. At this time, the emerging atmosphere was very different from the old days. Who knew that reformers, those nostalgic for the old, those who flattered foreigners, and all kinds of factions, in the process of carrying out the revolution, would compete with each other, contradict each other, rise and fall against each other, and even stage a series of dramas such as Hongxian's eighty days and the Qing Dynasty's seven days; there were also what were called Anhui Clique and Zhili Clique, which were neither fish nor fowl, each planting its own power. Warlord wars never ceased. The powerful countries of Western and Eastern imperialism, capitalism, and colonialism took the opportunity to attack openly, lure with benefits, and threaten, in fact provoking many parties. Domestic forces, pro-East and pro-West, set up banners and then withdrew them, plotting assassinations, scheming against each other at all times. The loyal and honest revolutionary figures were at one point undermined in their righteous policies and unable to grasp them in time. At that time, the people of the whole country, during the day, suffered the oppression, exploitation, enslavement, and pain of disease from enemy bandits, officials, powerful families, bullies, landlords, and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie; at night, they suffered the terror of arson, theft, and robbery. In addition, there was the ever-present threat of fire, water, knives, and weapons. Everyone's life had no guarantee, and no one knew when their fate would end. Virtuous and wise people, wanting to preserve a useful body, had to hide in small circles, in another small universe, and live a life of excessive worry.

Once 1949 arrived, with the liberation of the whole country, suddenly both urban and rural areas turned into brand new faces, and the people all gave rise to joyful hearts. Men and women, everyone seemed to be in the period of newlyweds; old and young, everyone seemed to be celebrating New Year's Day and the Lantern Festival. Interest was renewed day by day, and construction increased year by year. In the people, in the country, in the international arena, in thought, in policy, in science, in technology, in production, from subjective to objective, from idealism to materialism, from contradiction to unity, from individual to collective, from promotion to automation, from private to public ownership, from ascension to public election, from education to influence, from government orders to suggestions, from science to philosophy, from manual to mechanical, from firepower to hydraulic power, from floods to water conservancy, from agriculture to industry, from competition to mutual assistance, from hostility to friendship, from war to peace. And all the barren mountains, deserts, riverbeds, border areas, sloping flatlands, and swirling ravines have gradually become mining capitals, oil fields, orchards, and pastures. And all those who are idle and lazy, disabled, blind, and deaf, have gradually become settled and employed, sharing equally in welfare. And all the flies, mosquitoes, fleas, lice, pests, have gradually launched widespread cleaning, elimination, and purification.

From the founding of the country to the present, declarations, inventions, discoveries, excavations have been flourishing, like bamboo shoots after the rain. The motherland is so warm today, the Chinese are so glorious today; the fate of everyone's individual, everyone's next generation of children, is firmly linked with the future of the country. When everyone thinks of this, they cannot help but constantly reflect a kind of mood, forgetting vigilance; and almost completely forgetting that there is such a thing as birth, old age, sickness, and death in the world. Dr. Sukarno said: "Everyone in their seventies, sixties, fifties, forties, thirties, twenties, I don't know how many more times excited you are in your hearts than I am." I personally have also seen some people who seem to have gained weight even though they are thin, and the old have become young again. As for myself, old friends who have not seen me for many years say, "Your face was like this ten or twenty years ago, and your face is still like this now." In the old days, various countries regarded our country as the "sick man of East Asia." At that time, the people were of course more prone to illness, aging, and short lives. Today, the pain of the people of the so-called "sick man of East Asia" has been gradually cured. Everyone has regained their health, and everyone is of course difficult to age, and the life expectancy rate has of course increased.

Recalling last year's conference, Committee Member Deng Wenhui said: "I firmly believe that with the care and encouragement of the Party, I can live to be ninety to one hundred years old." Committee Member Liu Yaozhang said: "It makes me unconsciously forget that I am already sixty years old." Comrade Hu Shuhua said: "I am now making mental preparations. I still want to continue working for thirty years, and retire at the age of one hundred. I plan to live to one hundred and twenty years old." Judging from such straightforward and heartfelt speeches, and thinking of the two lines of poetry by the literati of the past dynasties, one line is from Du Fu's poem "It is rare for a person to live to seventy since ancient times." Because Du Zimei lived a dark, chaotic, poor, and depressed life in the Tang Dynasty, his hair turned white early, and he passed away at the age of fifty-nine. The common people at the same time were no exception. One line is from Cui Lingtong's poem "There has never been a hundred-year-old person in a hundred years." After Qin Shi Huang's exceptionally evil high-pressure autocracy, the harsh customs were followed, and the grassroots class completely lost freedom. The people had no way to possibly maintain health and longevity. Zhang Cang, Shen Gong, and Dongfang Shuo of the Han Dynasty, and Zhen Quan, Sun Simiao, and Qian Lang of the Tang Dynasty, could live to be over a hundred years old, either by relying on the power of the princes and kings, peacefully absorbing the people's wealth and blood, and supporting themselves to prolong their lives, or by being detached from the world, fasting and practicing stillness, wandering their minds in the vastness, or refining their essence and nourishing their spirit, abstaining from grains and consuming qi, to obtain old age, which should be discussed separately.

How fortunate we are to have met today, we can change the above two lines of poetry. The first line, "It is rare for a person to live to seventy since ancient times," should be changed to "Living to seventy is commonplace" or "Living to seventy is common today." The second line, "There has never been a hundred-year-old person in a hundred years," should be changed to "There have been many hundred-year-old people in a hundred years" or "Hundred-year-old people are commonplace." Everyone knows that among the nearly one thousand people present, there are more than ten who are over eighty years old. In the advanced country of the Soviet Union, recent statistics show that there are more than ten thousand people over one hundred years old in the country. Like myself, a person who looked like a sick man in the old days, I am now able to be happily energetic and come from thousands of miles to participate in the conference.

This conclusion is not that we can shut ourselves in and talk about hygiene factors, but that the Communist Party, the People's Government, Chairman Mao, and all leaders, laborers, and those who sacrificed blood and flesh and life before and after the liberation of the motherland, have created such a beautiful phenomenon and such a paradise on earth through a continuous and unprecedented great and heroic struggle. Moreover, we have all seen the infinitely bright prospects of the world today and tomorrow, which have been bestowed upon us.

Not only do I personally have such a mentality, but everyone present has the same mentality. Not only do everyone present have the same mentality, but also the thousands upon thousands of people who are not present have the same mentality. I personally dare to represent the mentality of the masses at the conference, and I respectfully speak out a fraction of it, please give me your advice. I respectfully wish everyone a victorious work! I respectfully wish everyone good health! (Attached picture)

    祖国一片新气象人生七十今不稀
    八一老人柯璜对比新旧两个时代畅谈自己的感想
    我听了各位负责首长的报告，各位各岗位的发言，我以最愉快心理，激动了全身生理，反映出万分鼓舞欢欣，上来向大会提供几句话。
    我是一个旧时代的小知识分子，在世上生活了八十一年。从清季光绪（公元1877年）到宣统辛亥；从辛亥到公元1949年，解放军解放了全国，中间由旧时代进入新纪元，所闻所见，一个是无限的苦痛悲酸，一个是无穷的欢愉兴奋，我的心境，前后如出两人，如同隔世，向在座大家告诉告诉。
    我在少时，稍读过几本经书，后来接触社会，看到报纸，觉得世间何以这样混杂，何以这样黑暗。到少壮时候，知识稍长成，见到当时官吏一些不合理作风。而劣绅、土豪、流氓又是这样遍地。我乃想起礼运，想起大学、中庸，想起雅颂、国风，时时发生一种痴情、玄想，羡慕古代的升平、太平、黄农、虞夏的盛世。世界明明是前进的车轮，如何可以倒过来向后转呢！如何容许有重演的历史呢！
    在1911年，中山先生发动民族民主革命，缔造中华民国，此时新兴气象，比较旧时大不相同。那知道，改良、恋旧、媚外、各样各派，在进行革命当中，乃互相雄长，互相矛盾，互相起伏，甚至演出洪宪八旬，后清七日的连篇戏剧；还有什么皖系直系等不伦不类的名目，各自树植势力，军阀战争，遂无宁日。国外东西帝国主义、资本主义、殖民主义的强国，乘机明攻、利诱、威胁，实在挑拨多方；国内亲东亲西，立帜拔帜，阴谋暗杀，彼此时刻相图。在忠诚老实革命人物，一时正大方针反被摧残，没法及时掌握。当时全国人民，白天，受着敌寇、官吏、豪门、恶霸、地主、官僚资产阶级的压迫、剥削、奴役，及疾病的痛苦，夜间，受着明火、盗窃、劫夺的恐怖。加以时刻防不及防的水火刀兵，人人生命，毫无保障，都不知命在何时。贤智人们，欲留有用之身，只好躲在小圈子，另一个小宇宙里，过度忧患生涯日子罢了。
    一到1949年，全国解放，突然城乡都变成崭新面貌，人民都发起欢喜心花。男的女的，人人仿佛在新婚新人的时期；老的少的，人人仿佛过元旦元宵的时节，兴趣日新一日，建设年增一年。在人民、在国家、在国际，思想上、政策上、科学上、技术上、生产上，由主观渐进客观，由唯心渐进唯物，由矛盾渐进统一，由个体渐进集体，由推动渐进自动，由私有渐进公有，由递升渐进公推，由教育渐进感化，由政令渐进建议，由科学渐进哲理，由手工渐进机械，由火力渐进水力，由水患渐进水利，由农业渐进工业，由互竞渐进互助，由敌对渐进友谊，由战争渐进和平。而一切荒山、沙漠、河床、边区、倾斜坪坝、涡潦溪坑，渐变为矿都、油田、果园、牧场。而且一切好闲游手、残废盲聋，渐成了安居乐业、福利均沾。并一切苍蝇、蚊子、蚤虱、病虫，渐发动到处扫除、消灭、廓清。
    从开国到现在，发表、发明、发现、发掘，蓬蓬勃勃，好像雨后春笋似的。祖国，今天这样温暖，华人，今天如此光荣；人人的个人，人人的下一代儿童命运，都同了国家前途离不开的坚强结合。人人一念及此，不觉时刻反映出一种心情，顿忘警惕；且几全忘了人间世有生老病死一事。苏加诺博士说：“大家在七十、六十、五十、四十、三十、二十的年，不知心里比我更兴奋了多少倍。”我个人也亲眼看见有些人，似乎身瘦的发了胖，年老的还了童。就我个人来说，有多年不见的老朋友见到我，都说：“你十年二十年前，面容如此，现在面容也是如此”。旧时各国有目我国为“东亚病夫国”，在那时候，人民当然多病、易老、不长寿。到了今天，所谓“病夫国”的人民病痛，都有步骤的治疗好了，人人恢复了健康，人人当然也难老，寿命率当然也长起来了。
    回忆去年大会上，邓文翬委员说：“我深信在党的关怀和鼓舞下，我能活到九十岁至一百岁。”刘瑶章委员说：“使我不知不觉忘了我已经是六十岁的人了。”胡庶华同志说：“我现在做精神准备。我还想继续工作三十年，到一百岁时候，再告老休息。准备活到百二十岁。”从这样直截了当的由衷发言看来，又想起昔年王朝文人的两句诗，一句是杜甫诗“人生七十古来稀”。因为杜子美在唐朝时过着黑暗、乱离、穷困、苦闷的日子，早白了少年头，五十九岁便去了世。同时的老百姓更不能例外。一句是崔龄童诗“百岁曾无百岁人”。中华经秦祖龙、特殊恶性高压专制之后，苛风沿袭，基层阶级，全失自由，人民无法可能保健长命。汉代张苍、申公、东方朔，唐代甄权、孙思邈、钱朗辈，能活到百余岁，不是倚仗侯王威力、泰然吸取人民膏血、供养自己、延长生命，便是超世忘世、长斋习静、游心溟漠、或炼精养神、辟谷服气，获得高年，又当别论。
    我们何幸欣逢着今天，可把以上两句诗，变易一下。第一句“人生七十古来稀”，当易为“人生七十寻常事”或“人生七十今天多”。第二句“百岁曾无百岁人”，当改作“百岁曾多百岁人”或“百岁寻常百岁人”。大家都知道，在座不到千余人中，年过八十以上的，竟有十余人之多。先进国苏联，近年统计全国百岁以上的人民有一万余人。如我个人、在旧时病夫样子的人，现在能够欣欣踊跃，万里而来，参加大会。
    这个结论，不是我们关起门能讲点卫生的因素，都是共产党、人民政府、毛主席和一切领导者、劳动者以及解放祖国时前后牺牲血肉与生命者，一联贯的空前伟大英勇奋斗，造成这样优美现象，造成这样极乐人间。而且，都见到世界今天、明天光芒万丈的远景，来赐给我们的。
    不仅我个人有如此心理，在座各位也同此心理。不仅在座各位，同此心理，即不在座的千千万万人民群众，也同此心理。我个人在大会，敢代表群众心理，谨说出万一，请各位指教。敬祝各位工作胜利！敬祝各位身体健康！（附图片）
