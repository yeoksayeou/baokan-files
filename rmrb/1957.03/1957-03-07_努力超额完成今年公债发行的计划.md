    Strive to Overfulfill This Year's Government Bond Issuance Plan
    Currently, staff members of some government organizations, groups, and enterprises, as well as the armed forces in cities like Beijing, Tianjin, and Shenyang, have begun to subscribe to government bonds. Judging from the subscription situation in these units, a significant characteristic of this year is the speed of subscription, the amount of over-subscription, and the early payment. The units that have already started subscribing have overfulfilled their subscription plans. Some units' subscription amounts exceeded the original plan by more than double, and in many units, the percentage of people subscribing to government bonds reached 100%. This newspaper pointed out in the editorial "Enthusiastically Subscribe to the 1957 National Economic Construction Bonds" that there are many favorable conditions this year for completing the government bond issuance plan. Now, facts prove that the amount of government bonds subscribed this year will greatly exceed the original plan.
    During this year's government bond subscription process, we have seen many touching events. After the Dongsi District People's Committee and its affiliated units in Beijing held a mobilization meeting, they subscribed to more than 23,000 yuan within a few hours, exceeding the original plan by more than 10%, and many people paid in cash on the spot. Seven units of the General Logistics Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army exceeded their original plan by 38%. Many employees and officers and soldiers of the armed forces have voluntarily made plans for thrift and frugality, preparing to temporarily postpone the purchase of watches, bicycles, wool fabrics, and other non-essential consumer goods, saving money to buy more government bonds. Song Xieyi, a cadre of the Dongjiao District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing, had saved 100 yuan and planned to buy a watch; after the government bond subscription work began, he thought that he did not urgently need a watch at present, so he bought all the bonds. Song Dexiang, an employee of the Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Textile Products Company, originally planned to buy a lot of beautiful printed cloth and New Year goods to take home for the Spring Festival; later, he saved the money and bought 175 yuan of government bonds. There are many such examples in various places. In some areas where the subscription work started earlier, industrialists, businessmen, and the peasant masses are also subscribing to government bonds more enthusiastically than in previous years.
    The high enthusiasm and initiative shown by the people in subscribing to government bonds demonstrate the continuous improvement of the socialist and patriotic consciousness of the Chinese people. Everyone knows that the growth rate of the purchasing power of the broad masses of the Chinese people in the past year has exceeded the growth rate of the production of means of livelihood. During the Spring Festival this year, the staff members, officers, soldiers, and workers living in the cities consciously bought fewer non-staple foods that were in short supply in the market, which greatly alleviated the difficulties in the market's supply of goods. Now, the broad masses of the people are actively subscribing to government bonds, which is not only a mutually beneficial move for both the public and private sectors, but also will help to further stabilize the market situation.
    In order to better ensure the completion and overfulfillment of this year's government bond issuance plan, we must pay attention to doing a good job in propaganda and education. Some comrades believe that government bonds have been issued for several years, and this is an annual event, so it is enough to subscribe and pay at the time, and there is no need to carry out any further propaganda and education. This idea is wrong. In fact, the level of awareness among the masses is still uneven, so it is still necessary to carry out propaganda and education work among them. At the same time, we also hope that when various regions and units promote government bonds, they should not only strive to complete the allocated amount, but also combine it with the increase production and practice economy movement to conduct an in-depth patriotic education among the broad masses of the people, mobilize the broad masses of the people to carry forward the spirit of hard work, save all the money that can be saved, and support national construction. As a result of doing this, we will be able to increase our strength greatly and overcome any difficulties in our progress.
    On the basis of fully carrying out ideological mobilization and raising the consciousness of the masses, we should conscientiously implement the principle of "rational distribution, voluntary participation according to ability" and adhere to the sales method of persuasion and mobilization. On the one hand, we must strictly prevent simple and rigid work styles and the practice of equal distribution. Because this practice will not only hinder the completion of the sales task, but also cause misunderstandings and dissatisfaction among the people. On the other hand, we must also encourage the active actions of the masses to voluntarily oversubscribe. After the subscription, the relevant departments must also actively organize the work of payment, and must prevent the "tiger's head and snake's tail" style of vigorous subscription and no one responsible for payment, to ensure the successful completion of all work tasks.
    Since China began issuing economic construction bonds in 1954, it has overfulfilled the plan every year. 1957 is the last year of China's first five-year plan. In order to replenish the state's economic construction funds and ensure the early and over-fulfillment of the first five-year plan, we believe that as long as the people of the whole country universally recognize the special significance of this year's government bond issuance, they will certainly strive to overfulfill the state's government bond issuance plan this year.

### 努力超额完成今年公债发行的计划

    努力超额完成今年公债发行的计划
    目前，北京、天津、沈阳等城市的一部分机关、团体、企业中的工作人员和武装部队已经开始认购公债。从这些单位认购的情形来看，今年的显著特点是认购快、超额多、交款早。已经开始认购的单位，都超额完成了认购计划。有些单位的认购额超过原定计划一倍多，不少单位认购公债的人数达到百分之百。本报在“踊跃认购1957年国家经济建设公债”的社论中，曾经指出今年有许多有利条件可以完成公债的发行计划。现在事实证明今年公债认购的数目将大大超过原定的计划。
    在今年认购公债的过程中，我们看到很多动人的事情。北京市东四区人民委员会和所属各单位开完动员大会以后，几小时之内就认购了二万三千多元，超过原定计划10％以上，不少人当场交了现款。中国人民解放军总后勤部有七个单位认购数超过原计划38％。有许多职工和部队官兵自动地订了勤俭持家的计划，准备暂时不买手表、自行车、呢绒以及其它非迫切需要的消费物资，省下钱来多买一些公债。中共北京市东郊区委员会的干部宋协义积存了一百元，打算买手表；认购公债工作开始以后，他想到目前自己还不迫切需要手表，就全部买了公债。中国纺织品公司天津采购供应站职工宋德祥，本来准备买很多漂亮的花布和年货带回家去过春节；后来他把钱节省下来，买了一百七十五元公债。这种例子各地都有不少。在认购工作开始时间较早的一部分地区，工商业者和农民群众认购公债的也比往年更加踊跃。
    人民群众在认购公债中表现的高度热情和积极性，说明我国人民的社会主义和爱国主义觉悟水平不断地提高。大家知道，我国广大人民群众的购买力在过去一年内的增长速度，超过了生活资料生产的增长速度。今年春节的时候，住在城市中的工作人员、军官和职工群众都自觉地少买市场上缺少的副食品，使市场上物资供应的困难大大减轻了。现在，广大人民群众积极认购公债，这不但是公私两利的举动，而且将有助于市场状况的进一步稳定。
    为了更好地保证完成和超额完成今年公债的发行计划，我们必须注意作好宣传教育工作。有些同志认为，发行公债已经有几年了，这是一年一度的事情，到时候认购交款就行了，用不着再进行什么宣传教育。这种想法是不对的。事实上，群众的觉悟程度仍然是不齐的，所以还必须向他们进行宣传教育工作。同时，我们还希望各地区和各单位在推销公债的时候，不只要努力完成分配的数额，而且要结合增产节约运动，向广大人民进行一次深入的爱国主义教育，动员广大人民，发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，节省一切可以节省的钱，支援国家建设。这样做的结果，我们就能够增加很大的力量，克服我们前进中的任何困难。
    在充分做好思想动员、提高群众觉悟的基础上，应当认真地贯彻执行“合理分配、自愿量力”的原则，坚持说服动员的推销方法。一方面，要严格防止简单的生硬的作风和平均摊派的做法。因为这种做法不但会妨害推销任务的完成，而且会引起人民群众的误解和不满。另一方面，也要鼓励群众自愿超额认购的积极行动。认购以后，有关部门还要积极组织交款的工作，必须防止认购时轰轰烈烈、交款时无人负责的“虎头蛇尾”作风，保证全部工作任务的圆满完成。
    我国从1954年开始发行经济建设公债以来，年年都是超额完成计划。1957年是我国第一个五年计划的最后一年，为了给国家充实经济建设资金，保证提前和超额完成第一个五年计划，我们相信全国人民只要普遍认识今年公债发行的特殊意义，就一定会努力争取更多地超额完成今年国家的公债发行计划。
