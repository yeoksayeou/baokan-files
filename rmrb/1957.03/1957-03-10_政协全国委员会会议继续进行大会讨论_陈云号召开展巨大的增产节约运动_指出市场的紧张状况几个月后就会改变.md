Xinhua News Agency, March 9th: Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yun today called on the people and the government to cooperate in carrying out a massive campaign to increase production and practice economy in order to smoothly overcome the difficulties of 1957 and successfully complete China's first Five-Year Plan.

The Third Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference continued its plenary session discussions this morning.

Chen Yun spoke on the current market situation and this year's campaign to increase production and practice economy.

Chen Yun said that the tense situation in the supply of some materials in 1956 was not due to a decline in the production of these materials, but because the growth of social purchasing power exceeded the growth of materials.

Chen Yun said that although there was a tense supply of certain materials in 1956, the market as a whole remained stable. The temporary tense market situation is currently changing and will change in a few months.

Chen Yun said that in 1957 we should launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy throughout the country. He explained the particularly important significance of increasing production and practicing economy this year, and pointed out the ways to increase production and practice economy.

Liu Wenhui then spoke. He introduced the situation of the Sichuan Provincial Democratic Personages Political School and the Industrial and Commercial Short-term Training Class. He said that the practice of this work proves that the correct implementation of the principles of voluntariness, consciousness, and free debate is an important key to doing a good job in study.

Yue Jieheng, Vice President of Northwest University, raised concerns about the weak teaching staff and scientific research personnel in universities and colleges in the Northwest region. He hoped that the government could appropriately allocate experts returning from the Soviet Union and capitalist countries to the Northwest region; he hoped that the Ministry of Higher Education, the Academy of Sciences, and relevant universities would take care of the teachers sent from the interior for advanced studies in all aspects. He also suggested inviting experts from other regions to give short-term lectures in the Northwest, assigning advanced graduate students from other places to the Northwest, and holding academic conferences in the Northwest to make up for the shortage of teachers in the Northwest.

Yang Shutang, Chief Engineer of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, talked about the progress of Anshan Iron and Steel's engineering and technical personnel in advancing towards science and technology. He said that all activities in enterprises to advance towards science and technology must be closely linked to reality and serve production.

Hou Debang said in his speech that with the increase of the rural population, the number of houses and graves has also greatly increased, which will inevitably lead to the shrinking of the area of arable land. In order to protect the existing arable land, he suggested: cremation should be promoted in the future to avoid scattered burials and not to build graves on cultivated land. Rural construction plans should be carried out in the future to avoid the haphazard and scattered construction of rural houses, which occupy too much arable land.

Liu Hongwen, Vice Chairman of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, who attended the meeting, spoke on the situation in rural Henan.

Wang Yiming, who was elected Vice Mayor of Wuhan last year, said that before liberation, he only ran a private joint venture flour mill. Now the Party and the people have given him unlimited trust and entrusted him with such a great task as the Vice Mayor of Wuhan. He said that he will strive to achieve the following sixteen characters in the future: Obey leadership; Rely on the masses; Be careful and bold; Make subjective efforts.

Zhao Puchu thanked the government for its great efforts in implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief in recent years. At the same time, he also pointed out that there are still things in various places that violate religious policies and hinder religious life.

Chen Yinsheng, Vice Chairman of the Kunming Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, who attended the meeting, suggested that the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference establish a regular inspection system for local committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference once a year.

At today's meeting, three other people made written statements: Shi Jinmo, Sun Weiru, and Yang Gongshu.

Tomorrow is Sunday, and the meeting will be adjourned for one day. The conference will continue on the 11th.

    陈云号召开展巨大的增产节约运动
    指出市场的紧张状况几个月后就会改变
    据新华社9日讯　国务院副总理陈云今天号召全国人民和政府合作进行一个巨大的增产节约运动，以便顺利地克服1957年的困难，完满地完成我国第一个五年计划。
    中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第三次全体会议，今天上午继续进行大会讨论。
    陈云就目前的市场状况和今年的增产节约问题发言。
    陈云说，1956年有些物资供应发生紧张情况并不是因为这些物资产量下降，而是由于社会购买力增长的程度，超过了物资增长程度。
    陈云说，1956年某些物资虽然出现了供应紧张的情况，但就市场全局来说，仍然是稳定的。市场暂时的紧张状况，目前正在发生变化，而且在几个月以后就会有改变。
    陈云说，1957年我们要在全国范围内开展一个增产节约运动。他说明了今年增产节约具有特别重要的意义，并指出了进行增产节约的途径。
    刘文辉接着发言。他介绍了四川省各界民主人士政治学校和工商业者短期讲习班的情况。他说，通过这一工作的实践证明，正确地贯彻自愿、自觉和自由辩论的原则，是搞好学习的一个重要关键。
    西北大学副校长岳劼恒对西北地区高等院校教学力量和科学研究人员的阵容不强、数量不足提出了意见。他希望政府能把由苏联和资本主义国家回国的专家，适当分配到西北地区；希望高教部、科学院和有关的高等学校对内地派来的进修教师，从各方面给以照顾。他还建议延请其他地区的专家到西北短期讲学，将外地先进的研究生分配到西北地区，在西北地区举行学术会议，以补足西北师资不足。
    鞍山钢铁公司总工程师杨树棠在发言中谈到了鞍钢工程技术人员向科学技术进军的情况。他说，在企业内向科学技术进军的一切活动，必须密切联系实际，为生产服务。
    侯德榜在发言中说，随着农村人口增加，房屋和墓地也大大增多，这样势必使可耕地的面积越来越缩小。为了保护现有的可耕地，他建议：今后应提倡火葬，避免散葬，不在耕地上建造坟墓。今后应进行农村建设计划，避免农村房屋错综散乱，过多地占用可耕地。
    列席这次会议的政协河南省委员会副主席刘鸿文就河南农村情况发言。
    去年当选为武汉市副市长的王一鸣发言说，在解放以前，他只是搞一个私人合资的面粉厂，现在党和人民给了他以无限的信任，把武汉市副市长这样大的任务交给他。他表示今后要作到十六个字：服从领导；依靠群众；小心大胆；主观努力。
    赵朴初在发言中感谢政府几年来对于宗教信仰自由政策的贯彻所作的重大努力。同时，他也指出各地还存在着违反宗教政策、妨碍宗教生活的事情。
    列席这次会议的政协昆明市委员会副主席陈荫生，建议全国政协对地方政协建立一年一次经常性的视察制度。
    在今天的大会上，还有三人作了书面发言，他们是施今墨、孙蔚如和杨公庶。
    明天是星期日，会议休会一天。11日，大会将继续进行。
