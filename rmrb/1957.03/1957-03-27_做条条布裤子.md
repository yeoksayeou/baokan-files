　　Making Striped Cloth Pants
　　Yuan Xu
　　Zhang Yunxiang's husband, Guo Mingzhu, received a supplementary payment of eighty-one yuan during last year's wage reform. Yunxiang was very happy to hear this news and planned to use the supplementary money to make a woolen pants for herself and her husband, and to buy a pair of leather shoes for her husband.
　　Yunxiang grew up in a poor family. She had never even touched flannel, let alone worn woolen clothes. After her hometown was liberated, she once thought: now that we've been liberated, when will I be able to wear a piece of "An An Lan" fabric? I wouldn't regret it even if I died. However, over the years, as people's lives have continuously improved, Zhang Yunxiang has not only worn "An An Lan," but also khaki, gabardine..., and her husband has also bought a bicycle and a watch.
　　In December of last year, Yunxiang attended a district party representative meeting in Taiyuan City and listened to the district party secretary's report on the spirit of the Eighth Central Committee's Second Plenary Session. Every sentence of the report seemed to be directed at her. Only then did she realize that her enjoyment-seeking ideology had indeed grown and that she had forgotten the hardships of the past. After returning home from the meeting, the district party secretary's report kept echoing in her mind: as a communist party member, a Youth League branch secretary, a dormitory family director, and a bank teller, how can I educate everyone if I don't take the lead in promoting a spirit of hard work and simplicity?
　　After her husband came home from work, she told him about the spirit of the Party Committee Secretary's report, and said that she would not make woolen pants, but would deposit the money in the bank to support national construction. Her husband was very happy to hear it. Mingzhu felt that his wife's awareness had improved, that she did whatever the Party said, and his heart was filled with respect and joy. However, Mingzhu intentionally joked, "I think we should still make a pair to wear, otherwise it would be too unjust to die." "With Chairman Mao, it won't be unjust. Now we are advocating hard work and simplicity in order to have a better life in the future; in the future, we can wear better materials than woolen!" Seeing her husband smile, Yunxiang quickly said, "Okay, let's have a good discussion." In the end, the couple agreed that they would not make woolen pants this year, but would instead make striped cloth pants. They would keep six yuan of the eighty-one yuan in supplementary pay, and deposit the remaining seventy-five yuan in the bank.

　  做条条布裤子
　　原蓄
    张云香的丈夫郭明珠，在去年工资改革的时候，补发了八十一元的工资。云香听到这个消息很高兴，盘算要把补发的钱给自己和丈夫每人做一条呢子裤，再给丈夫买双皮鞋。
    云香，从小是在一个贫寒的家庭里长大的。她不用说穿毛料的衣服，就是连个线哗叽也没摸过。当她的家乡解放以后，她曾经想过：翻了身，啥时能穿上身安安蓝，死了也不冤枉。可是，几年来由于人民生活不断得到改善，张云香不但穿上了安安蓝，而且穿上了卡叽、华达呢……，丈夫也买下了车子和手表。
    去年12月份，云香出席了太原市一个区的党代表大会，听了区委书记关于八届二中全会精神的传达报告。报告的每一句话，都像对着她自己说的一样，这时她才感到自己的享受思想确实有所滋长，忘掉了从前的艰苦。她开完会回到家里，区委书记的报告一直在她脑子里回旋：自己是一个共产党员，担任团支部书记，又是宿舍家属主任，银行办储员，自己不能带头发扬艰苦朴素作风，又怎么去教育大家呢？
    她丈夫下班回家后，她就把党委书记报告的精神告诉了他，并说不做呢子裤子了，要把钱存入银行，支援国家建设。她丈夫听了，也很喜欢。明珠感到自己爱人的觉悟提高了，党怎么说，她就怎么做，尊重与喜悦的感情充满了他的内心。但是，明珠又有意开起玩笑了：“我看还是做件穿穿吧，不然死了太冤枉。”“有毛主席，冤枉不了，现在提倡艰苦朴素，就是为了将来日子过得更好；将来还能穿比呢子更好的料子呢！”云香看见丈夫笑了，便忙着说：“好啦，咱们还是好好商量商量吧”。最后两口儿商定：今年不做呢子裤，改做条条布裤子，补发的八十一元留下六元，其余的七十五元全部存进了银行。
