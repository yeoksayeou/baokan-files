    Response to Criticism of "An Extra Bonus"
    Letter from the General Office of the Ministry of Foreign Trade: On November 20th of last year, the People's Daily published an article by reader Shu Ren entitled "An Extra Bonus," which criticized our ministry's approval of the 1954 enterprise bonus fund of the former China Tea Company. We have conducted an investigation.
    In the past, enterprise bonuses for processing plants affiliated with foreign trade enterprises were approved by local governments. Standards varied from place to place, with some exceeding 5% of the total wage bill. Starting in 1954, according to instructions from the former Central Financial and Economic Commission, after the head office became the unit for extracting bonus funds, in order to consider the emotions of the processing plant workers, it was deemed inappropriate to rigidly require consistency with the head office in extracting 5% of the total wage bill. The principle of centralized control by the head office and internal adjustment by the head office (i.e., adjustment between trade enterprises and processing plants) was still adopted. In 1954, the processing plants of the Tea Company extracted an average of 3.8% according to local regulations, which was lower than 5%. As a result, the Tea Company had 80,000 yuan extra in the approval of bonuses for the processing plants.
    Originally, we also considered that this regulation might pose certain difficulties in implementation for some units, and we consulted with the Ministry of Finance, requesting that processing plants directly settle accounts according to the standards approved by the local governments, without incorporating them into the head office's extraction. However, this was not agreed to. Nevertheless, we believe that the centralized control by the head office is basically still feasible, because the quality of work completion of the processing plants and the head office are interconnected; at the same time, if there is a surplus in the bonus funds, it can be used across years according to regulations, allowing the head office to be more flexible when using the bonus funds. Therefore, the surplus portion of the Tea Company's bonus does not need to be returned to the ministry, nor does it need to be turned over to the state treasury.
    Because we did not explain these issues well to the company, nor did we revise the original regulations in a timely manner, these are shortcomings in our work.

### 对“一笔多余的奖金”批评的答复

    对“一笔多余的奖金”批评的答复
    对外贸易部办公厅来信：去年11月20日人民日报刊登读者庶仁同志“一笔多余的奖金”一文，对我部核批前中国茶叶公司1954年企业奖励基金工作提出批评，我们已经作了检查。
    对外贸易企业所属加工厂的企业奖励金，过去系由当地政府核批。各地标准不同，有的高于工资总额5％。1954年起，根据前中央财政经济委员会批示，总公司成为提取奖励金单位以后，因照顾到加工厂职工情绪，不能强求与公司一致按工资总额5％提取，仍采取总公司汇总掌握的原则下，由总公司自行内部调剂（即贸易企业和加工厂之间调剂）。茶叶公司的加工厂，1954年按地方规定标准提取平均为3.8％，低于5％，这样，茶叶公司在核批加工厂奖励金中就多了八万元。
    本来，我们也考虑到这种规定可能某些单位在执行上有一定困难，曾与财政部研究，要求对加工厂按照当地政府批准的标准直接结算，不并入总公司提取，但没有得到同意。不过我们认为总公司汇总掌握基本上还是可行的，因为加工厂和总公司工作完成的好坏是有连带关系的；同时奖励金如有节余，按规定可以跨年度使用，使总公司在使用奖励金时可以灵活一些。因此，茶叶公司的奖金多余部分可以不必缴还本部，也不必缴还国库。
    我们因为在这些问题上没有向公司很好解释说明，也没有及时地对原颁办法加以修订，这是我们工作中的缺点。
