    Looking Downward and Searching Everywhere
    Raw Materials Arrive in a Steady Stream
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Hanyang Machine Factory and Jiu'an Pharmaceutical Factory in Wuhan have mobilized the masses to overcome the difficulties of raw material shortages by every possible means, laying a preliminary foundation for the second quarter's production.
    Both factories are public-private joint ventures under the city's administration. The vast majority of their raw materials are not within the state allocation plan and rely on their own purchases on the market. At the beginning of this year, the Hanyang Machine Factory had only enough coal in storage for ten days, and there was no pig iron at all. Failure to solve these two material issues would lead to shutdowns and wasted labor. In the Jiu'an Pharmaceutical Factory, injection production accounts for 80% of the total production. In addition to the lack of various pharmaceutical raw materials, the factory also relied on the Wuhan Glass Factory for the "ampoules" needed to manufacture injections. However, the Wuhan Glass Factory lacked borax for manufacturing "ampoules" and could not meet their production needs.
    Under these circumstances, the Jiu'an Pharmaceutical Factory immediately mobilized the masses to discuss the current difficulties. Some advocated reducing production and personnel; others advocated "reaching out in all directions," sending people to recycle "ampoules." The leadership adopted the latter suggestion, extracting sixteen cadres and dividing them into five groups to set out, purchasing 4.33 million "ampoules," enough for two quarters of production. The Hanyang Machine Factory also sent twelve cadres to various places to find sources of goods, buying back more than 700 tons of pig iron and more than 100 tons of coking coal, basically enough for two quarters. While searching for materials in all directions, the Hanyang Machine Factory also paid special attention to tapping social potential. They dug up 48 tons of coal from the places on the upper reaches of the Han River where coal boats had previously capsized. At the same time, the Jiu'an Pharmaceutical Factory also sent technical cadres to the Wuhan Glass Factory to jointly trial-produce "low-boron ampoules" successfully and bought back 1.3 tons of borax from other places for the glass factory, helping the cooperative factory to overcome difficulties.
    Both factories also mobilized the masses to tap internal potential, conserve raw materials, and find substitutes.

### 眼睛向下四出寻找  原材料源源而来

    眼睛向下四出寻找
    原材料源源而来
    本报讯  武汉市汉阳机器厂和久安药厂发动群众千方百计地克服原材料缺乏的困难，初步为第二季度的生产打下了基础。
    这两个厂都是市属的公私合营工厂，绝大部分原材料都不在国家调拨计划之内，靠自己在市场上购买。今年一开始，汉阳机器厂储存的煤就只够十天之用，生铁一点没有，这两项材料解决不了就会发生停工和窝工。久安药厂的针剂生产占全部生产80％，这个厂除了各种制药原材料缺乏外，还特别因为制造针剂所需的“安瓿”瓶靠武汉玻璃厂供应，而武汉玻璃厂缺乏制造“安瓿”用的硼砂，不能在生产上满足他们的需要。
    在这种情况下，久安药厂即发动群众讨论当前的困难，有的主张减产、减人；有的主张“四出伸手”，派人至各处回收“安瓿”，领导上采纳了后一个意见，抽出了十六个干部，分作五路出发，购回了“安瓿”四百三十三万支，足够两个季度的生产用。汉阳机器厂也派了十二名干部到各地寻找货源，买回了七百多吨生铁，一百多吨焦煤，基本上够两个季度用。在四出找寻材料中，汉阳机器厂还特别注意挖掘社会潜力。他们从汉水上游从前翻了煤船的地方挖出了四十八吨煤。同时，久安药厂还派了技术干部去武汉玻璃厂共同试制“低硼安瓿”成功，并在外地替玻璃厂买回硼砂一点三吨，帮助协作工厂克服困难。
    这两个工厂还发动群众挖掘内部潜力，节约原材料，并寻找代用品。
