    The fierce wind whips up cotton-like snow,
    The earth is frozen like a white silver sheet,
    You carry a flashlight in your arms,
    Your wooden clapper inquires at every village door.
    Snow falls on your body, your beard freezes,
    Your hands knock unceasingly, your feet constantly move;
    You inspect the livestock sheds, warehouses, and haystacks,
    Even a patrolman couldn't be more careful.
    When you pass under that tall tile-roofed wall,
    You curiously listen to the sounds inside:
    The snores are so even and sweet,
    You suddenly recall a scene from the past:
    That was also a snowy night with a fierce wind,
    You passed by the window of this house,
    Just because the clapper sound disturbed the landlord's good dream,
    You were beaten and fined a month's hard labor!
    The landlord's good dream has long been shattered,
    The tile-roofed house is now inhabited by the descendants of the former farm laborers,
    To protect their peaceful sleep,
    You continue to patrol the village.
    In this vast northern winter night,
    The snow falls heavier and heavier, the clapper sounds tighter and tighter,
    I open the window and recite poetry to the snowy sky,
    Praising you, the sentinel of rural socialism!

    打更老人
    刘岚山
    狂风卷着棉团大的雪，
    大地冻得像一块白银，
    你怀里揣着一杆手电，
    木梆叩询着村里每一家大门。
    雪落在身上，胡须结了冰，
    你的手不停地敲，脚不停地走动；
    你察看着牲口棚、仓库和草堆，
    巡逻兵也不过这样谨慎。
    当你经过那高大的瓦屋墙下，
    你好奇地听听屋内动静：
    鼾声是这样的均匀和甜蜜，
    你忽然想起一幕往日的情景：
    那也是一个大风雪的深夜，
    你路过这座房屋窗前，
    只因为梆声惊醒地主老爷的好梦，
    你挨了一顿打，还罚了一个月苦工！
    地主老爷的好梦早已破灭了，
    瓦屋里现在住着当年雇农的儿孙，
    为了保卫他们的安睡，
    你又继续地满村巡行。
    在这宽广的北方冬夜里，
    雪越下越大，梆声越敲越紧，
    我推开窗子向着雪空念诗，
    赞美你这农村社会主义的哨兵！
