Xinhua News Agency, London, March 28th. The strike of British shipbuilding workers and machinists, already involving 1.2 million people, is continuing to expand. On March 27th, the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions called on 500,000 machinists in the London area (who have not yet participated in the strike) to join the strike on March 30th, pushing this "snowballing" strike into its second phase. This would bring all factories in the London area, which produce one-fifth of Britain's mechanical products, to a standstill.

This decision was made by the executive committee of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions after hearing a report from their six negotiators on the talks held on the evening of March 26th with Wilfred Neden, the Chief Conciliation Officer of the British Ministry of Labour.

Currently, the strike of 200,000 shipbuilding workers has entered its thirteenth day. The strike of one million machinists, affecting ten major industrial areas, has also entered its sixth day.

Xinhua News Agency, March 27th. Bermuda news: British Prime Minister Macmillan, after concluding talks with Canadian Prime Minister St. Laurent, returned to Britain a day early at midnight on the 26th. According to the Associated Press, he returned home early to deal with the "difficult labor relations" at home.

　　英国罢工继续扩大
　　又有五十万机械工人将加入行列
    新华社伦敦28日电  已经有一百二十万人参加的英国造船工人和机械工人的罢工有继续扩大之势。造船工人及机械工业工人工会联合会3月27日号召伦敦地区的五十万机械工人（到目前为止还没有参加罢工）在3月30日参加罢工，把这次被称为“滚雪球式的”罢工推进到第二阶段。这将使得生产英国五分之一的机械产品的伦敦地区的工厂全部停工。
    这个决定是造船工人及机械工业工人工会联合会执行委员会在听取了他们的六位谈判代表报告了3月26日晚间同英国劳工部负责劳资问题的首席专员韦尔弗雷德·纳登进行会谈的情况之后作出的。
    目前，二十万造船工人的罢工已经进入第十三天。波及十个主要工业地区的一百万机械工人的罢工，也已经进行到第六天。
    新华社27日讯  百慕大消息：英国首相麦克米伦在结束同加拿大总理圣劳伦的会谈以后，在26日午夜提前一天赶回英国。据美联社消息指出，他提前回国是为了应付国内“困难的劳资关系”。
