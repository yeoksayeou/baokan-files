Why are Yunnan Opera Performers Unable to Find Roles?
Peng Guozhen Calls on Cultural Departments to Protect This Border Region Opera Genre

I wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao's instructions at the Supreme State Conference and Premier Zhou's "Report on Visits to Eleven Asian and European Countries." I also fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Explanation of Several Issues Regarding the Proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan," Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC," and Vice Premier Chen Yun's special speech "On the Current Market Situation and This Year's Production Increase and Thrift Campaign." I am a Yunnan Opera actor, and I would like to share some thoughts and opinions on Yunnan Opera here.

Yunnan Opera is a local opera, and like many other small opera genres, it was basically met with contempt and indifference in the old society. The social status of the performers was very low, and economic hardship was especially common and severe. Some performers even died without a coffin. After liberation, the situation completely changed. Not only did the social status and economic conditions of the performers undergo fundamental changes, but the entire genre also had broad prospects for development. In 1952, we participated in the National Opera Festival, where we learned and absorbed many valuable things through exchanges and observations with various opera genres, thereby improving the ideological and artistic level of our entire genre. Last year, we performed in Beijing for the second time. The leadership gave us great support, and the masses unanimously praised us, which was a tremendous encouragement to us. We sincerely thank the Party and the government for their concern, and we also thank the cultural departments for their specific leadership and assistance. Truly, as a performer who came from the old society, I feel with unparalleled sincerity that the old and new societies are two different worlds.

Under the developing situation of the entire country and encouraged by the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom," our genre urgently demands development, improvement, and adaptation to the development of the entire society. However, there are still some factors that affect the high-speed development of our genre. For example, we feel that the cultural departments that directly lead us are grasping us too much and too tightly. The first problem is the shortage of scripts. Up to now, although we have unearthed more than 800 traditional repertoires, none of them have been organized, and of course, none have been approved for performance, so the performers often feel that there are no plays to perform. Last November, we held a script workshop, in which the Cultural Bureau and veteran artists cooperated to initially organize 40 repertoires, but they still have not been approved. Secondly, the relationship between cultural department cadres and artists is not good enough, and the style of individual comrades is relatively rigid, which makes the artists feel disappointed and even discouraged. Cultural leading departments in prefectures and counties still have the phenomenon of looking down on artists. For example, an actor from Dali organized a script called "Waiting-for-Husband Cloud," which had a very good effect in Dali, but it was not approved for performance in Kunming. Because the Cultural Bureau believed that the script was of low level and wanted to have it rewritten by cadres. Another example is in the excavation of traditional repertoires, a veteran artist contributed more than 200 scripts, which is a very valuable enthusiasm, but the cultural department only gave three mao per script. However, if cadre comrades organize one or two scripts and publish them, they can get hundreds of yuan in royalties. In short, many cadres underestimate the artists. They always feel that only what they make is high-level and good. In addition, there are still some problems in the relationship between young and old artists. The leadership emphasizes cultivating new forces more and thinks less about the old artists, and not enough attention is paid to the political and professional education of young actors. The above situations may also exist in other local opera genres, so I raise them in the hope of attracting the attention of cultural leading departments.

Yunnan Opera originated and developed in the border region of the motherland. In the motherland's garden where a hundred flowers bloom, this can be regarded as a camellia in a remote area. We ask the central leadership to give special care to this flower in a remote area, cultivate it more, and protect it. Give us more instructions and more help. At the same time, I also hope that the people's representatives and CPPCC members can pay attention to the literary and artistic aspects of Yunnan during their inspection work, so as to help us overcome our shortcomings and make this flower bloom more brightly and beautifully.

I wish the conference a complete success and all the members good health. (Attached image)

### 滇剧艺人为什么无戏可演　彭国珍要求文化部门护养祖国边疆的这个剧种

　　滇剧艺人为什么无戏可演
　　彭国珍要求文化部门护养祖国边疆的这个剧种
    我衷心拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上的指示和周总理“关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告”，我也完全同意李富春副总理“关于第二个五年计划建议的若干问题的说明”、陈叔通副主席“政协第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告”和陈云副总理“就目前的市场状况和今年的增节产约问题”的专题发言。我是一个滇剧演员，在这里我想谈一些关于滇剧的感想和意见。
    滇剧是一种地方戏，和其他许多小型剧种一样，旧社会所给予它的，基本上是轻视和冷淡。艺人的社会地位很低，经济困难的情形尤其普遍和严重，有的艺人死了连棺材都没有。解放以后，情况完全变了。不仅艺人的社会地位、经济情况有了根本改变，而且整个剧种也有了广阔的发展前途。一九五二年我们参加了全国戏曲会演，在各个剧种的交流观摩中，学习和吸收到了许多宝贵的东西，因此也提高了我们整个剧种的思想和艺术水平。去年我们第二次来京演出，领导上给了我们很大的支持，群众也一致给我们好评，这对我们是巨大的鼓励。我们衷心感谢党和政府所给予我们的关怀，同时也感谢文化部门所给予我们的具体的领导和帮助。真的，作为一个从旧社会过来的艺人，我无比真切地感觉到新旧社会是两个不同的天地。
    在整个国家发展的形势下，在党的百花齐放的政策的鼓舞下，我们这个剧种迫切地要求发展，要求提高，要求与整个社会的发展相适应。但目前还是有一些因素影响着我们剧种的高速度发展。比如我们感觉到直接领导我们的文化部门对我们抓得过多过紧。首先一个问题就表现在剧本荒上。到现在我们虽然已经发掘出了八百多种的传统剧目，但都未整理，当然也没有批准上演，因此艺人们常常感到无戏可演。去年十一月办了一个剧目讲习班，由文化局和老艺人合作，初步整理了四十个剧目，但也仍然迟迟未获批准。其次是文化部门干部和艺人的关系不够好，个别同志的作风比较生硬，使得艺人们感到失望，甚至灰心。专区和县的文化领导部门仍存在着看不起艺人的现象。比如大理一个演员整理了一个“望夫云”的剧本，在大理演出效果很好，可是在昆明就没有批准上演。因为文化局认为这个剧本水平低，想要另外由干部来编写。又如在发掘传统剧目中，一位老艺人献出了二百多个剧本，这种积极性是非常可贵的，可是文化部门每个剧本只给三毛钱。而干部同志整理出一个两个剧本拿出去发表，就可以得几百元稿费。总之，许多干部对艺人估计过低，他们总觉得只有自己作出来的才是水平高的，好的。此外在青年和老年艺人的关系上，也还存在一些问题，领导上强调培养新生力量比较多，对老年艺人想得比较少，而对青年演员的政治和业务的教育也注意得很不够。以上这些情况，也许在别的地方剧种中也可能存在，所以我提出来，希望引起文化领导部门的注意。
    滇剧发生和发展在祖国的边疆，在祖国百花齐放的大花园里，这可以算是边远地区的一棵山茶花。我们要求中央领导方面对于这棵边远地区的花特别关怀，更多地栽培它，护养它。多给我们指示，多给我们帮助。同时也希望人民代表和政协委员在视察工作中能够注意到云南的文艺方面，以便帮助我们克服缺点，使这棵花开放得更鲜艳，更美丽。
    敬祝大会胜利成功，各位委员身体健康。（附图片）
