Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 1st: Saudi Arabian King Saud left Cairo by plane on the morning of February 28th to return to his country after attending the Arab Four-Nation Summit.

Saud told reporters on February 27th that the unity of free Arab countries such as Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Yemen will not be broken for any reason in the future. On the same day, he told a reporter from "Al-Ahram" that Arab countries are realizing complete unity. He also said, "Our aim is to make all Arab people independent."

Syrian President Kuwatly told a reporter from "Al-Ahram" on February 27th that the Arab Four-Nation Summit was "completely successful at every stage." He expressed his belief that this meeting will be "a prelude to joint action taken by Arabs for the benefit of the entire Arab nation."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 1st: Jordanian King Hussein (formerly translated as Hussein) issued a statement on February 28th after the joint communiqué of the Arab Four-Nation Summit was issued, saying: "Today we are facing the future with a closely united team, consistent views and beliefs," "We are all determined to do our best to fulfill our obligations."

He also said, "Jordan is steadfastly determined to defend the Arab cause and resist the common enemy."

Jordanian Prime Minister Nabulsi told reporters from the Middle East News Agency on February 28th that Jordan will firmly implement a policy of active neutrality and will strictly abide by the contents of the joint communiqué issued by the Arab heads of state in Cairo.

He emphasized that the Arabs are very eager to maintain friendly relations with both the East and the West. He said: "We will never be hostile to any country except those who are hostile to us."

Nabulsi said that Jordan has never asked for, nor has it ever received, economic assistance from the United States or the Soviet Union, but it will not object to considering any suggestions from any foreign country, as long as such suggestions are not attached with any conditions.

Nabulsi also said that Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan have decided to adopt a consistent attitude towards the Eisenhower Doctrine. He said that the four Arab countries will tell the delegation that U.S. President Eisenhower intends to send to Middle Eastern countries their views.

Xinhua News Agency, March 1st: Damascus News: Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar told reporters on February 28th that the "foreign propaganda" that Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan will abandon their independent neutral policy "has failed." He said that the four Arab countries' insistence on a policy of active neutrality and eliminating the Cold War in the Middle East is necessary to ease international tensions.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 1st: The Egyptian "Al-Gomhouria" published an editorial on February 28th saying that the joint communiqué of the Arab four heads of state "powerfully answered the international conspiracy attempting to shake the foundation of Arab unity."

The editorial pointed out that this kind of conspiracy activity is "trying to bargain on the indisputable sovereignty of Egypt over the Suez Canal, and to use the Arab East as the stage for a third world war, so that the Arabs will act as cannon fodder in such a war, tightly linking them to the West's crazy adventurous actions."

The newspaper said that the Arab leaders reiterated their strong unity and the consistency of their goals on all Arab issues with a firm answer.

"Al-Ahram" said, "The spirit of unity is full of the lines of the communiqué. The Arabs have formed a strong unified front, and today this front is stronger than ever before." The newspaper said that the reaffirmation of the neutral policy will "protect the Arab world from the Cold War and keep the region outside the scope of foreign conventions, whether Eastern or Western."

"Al-Misaa" chief editor Mohieddin wrote in an editorial that the conference communiqué affirmed the unity of the Arab group, which panicked the imperialists who have been spreading rumors that there are differences between Arab leaders and that the conference has failed.

Xinhua News Agency, March 1st: Amman News: Jordanian newspapers on March 1st welcomed the joint communiqué issued by the Arab Four-Nation Summit.

"Falastin" newspaper said that the Four-Nation Summit communiqué shattered the "malicious thought" of those who expected that Arab leaders would not reach an agreement on a policy of active neutrality and condemnation of foreign conventions.

Xinhua News Agency, March 1st: According to United Press International, Washington News: U.S. officials admitted on February 28th that they were "disappointed" that the communiqué of the Arab four-nation heads of government meeting failed to mention Eisenhower's Middle East plan in an approving manner.

These officials said that the U.S. government had explained the plan to the Saudi Arabian King during his visit to the United States. The U.S. government also hoped that the Saudi Arabian King would be able to persuade other Arab leaders to support the plan after returning to the Middle East.

    沙叙约三国首脑指出
    阿拉伯四国会议促进了团结
    美国对会议公报未提到“艾森豪威尔主义”感到失望
    据新华社开罗1日电  沙特阿拉伯国王沙特在参加阿拉伯四国首脑会议后，2月28日上午乘飞机离开开罗回国。
    沙特在2月27日对报界说，埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯、约旦、也门等自由的阿拉伯国家的团结将来不会因为任何理由而破裂。他在同一天曾经对“金字塔报”记者发表谈话说，阿拉伯国家正在实现完全的团结。他又说：“我们的目的是要使所有阿拉伯国家的人民获得独立”。
    叙利亚总统库阿特利2月27日对“金字塔报”记者说，阿拉伯四国首脑会议在“各个阶段都是完全成功的”。他表示相信，这次会议将是“阿拉伯人为了整个阿拉伯民族的利益而采取联合行动的前奏”。
    新华社开罗1日电  约旦国王侯赛因（前译侯赛尼）在阿拉伯四国首脑会议联合公报发表后，在2月28日发表声明说：“我们今天正以紧密团结的队伍、一致的观点和信念面对着将来”，“我们都决心尽我们最大的力量履行我们的义务”。
    他还说：“约旦坚定不移地决心保卫阿拉伯事业，抵抗共同的敌人。”
    约旦首相纳布西2月28日在接见中东通讯社记者时说，约旦将坚决实行积极的中立政策，并将严格遵守阿拉伯国家首脑开罗会议发表的联合公报的内容。
    他强调指出，阿拉伯人非常希望同东西方都保持友好关系。他说：“除了对那些敌视我们的国家以外，我们永远不会敌视任何国家。”
    纳布西说，约旦从来没有要求过，也从来没有得到过美国或者苏联的经济援助，但是它将不反对考虑任何外国的任何建议，只要这种建议不附有任何条件。
    纳布西还说，埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯和约旦已经决定对艾森豪威尔主义采取一致的态度。他说，四个阿拉伯国家将把它们的观点告诉美国总统艾森豪威尔打算派往中东国家的代表团。
    据新华社1日讯  大马士革消息：叙利亚外交部长比塔尔2月28日对新闻记者说，那种宣扬叙利亚、埃及、沙特阿拉伯和约旦将放弃它们的独立的中立政策的“外国宣传已经失败了”。他说，这四个阿拉伯国家坚持积极的中立政策和消除中东地区的冷战对于缓和国际紧张局势是必要的。
    据新华社开罗1日电  埃及“共和国报”2月28日发表社论说，阿拉伯四国首脑的联合公报“有力地答复了企图动摇阿拉伯团结的基础的国际阴谋”。
    社论指出，这种阴谋活动是“想在埃及对苏伊士运河的无容争辩的主权问题上进行讨价还价，并且以阿拉伯东方作为第三次世界大战的舞台，从而使阿拉伯人在这样的战争中充当炮灰，把他们同西方的疯狂冒险行动紧紧地联系在一起”。
    这家报纸说，阿拉伯领袖们以坚决的答复重申他们坚强的团结和在一切阿拉伯问题上目的的一致。
   “金字塔报”说，“公报的字里行间到处充满团结的精神。阿拉伯人组成了一条坚固的统一阵线，而今天这条阵线的强大超过了以前任何时候。”这家报纸说，中立政策的重申将“保护阿拉伯世界远离冷战，并且使这个地区置身于外国公约的范围以外，不论是东方的还是西方的”。
   “晚报”主编毛希丁在社论中写道，会议公报肯定了阿拉伯集团的团结，它使一直在散布谣言说阿拉伯领袖之间有分歧和会议已经失败的帝国主义者惊慌失措。
    新华社1日讯  安曼消息：约旦报纸1日表示欢迎阿拉伯四国首脑发表的联合公报。
   “巴勒斯坦报”说，四国会议公报使那些预期阿拉伯领袖不会在积极的中立政策和谴责外国公约方面取得一致这种“幸灾乐祸的想头”破了产。
    据新华社1日讯  据合众社华盛顿消息：美国官员2月28日承认，他们对阿拉伯四国政府首脑会议公报未能以赞同的态度提到艾森豪威尔的中东计划“感到失望”。
    这些官员说，在沙特阿拉伯国王访问美国时，美国政府曾经向他解释了这个计划。美国政府并且希望沙特阿拉伯国王返回中东后能够说服其他的阿拉伯国家领袖们支持这个计划。
