Xinhua News Agency, March 7th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhu Jigong reports: China's first female tractor driver, Liang Jun, has now completed her four-year university course and graduated from the Beijing Agricultural Mechanization Institute. Today, she told reporters: "I will return to Beidahuang to support land reclamation as if returning to my mother's home!" She is now packing her bags, preparing to depart in a week with her classmates.

This twenty-seven-year-old female college student from a worker-peasant background recalled the scene when she first entered university. She said: How could people not be happy that a girl like me could go to university? In the first year of learning calculus, listening to lectures was like taking an airplane, dizzy and confused. There is no trick to breaking through difficulties, just work hard day and night, don't pretend to understand if you don't, and ask teachers and classmates for advice. Later, I was gradually able to keep up. Her final semester grade was four.

Before liberation, her family was poor, and she dropped out of school after four years of primary school. In 1948, she learned to be a tractor driver, and in 1951, after three months of intensive tutoring in the main courses of junior and senior high school, she entered this college.

When asked by reporters about the difficulties Liang Jun might face in supporting land reclamation, she said, "Land reclamation" is a very dear phrase to me. There will be no insurmountable difficulties in land reclamation. I came from Beidahuang, and when I get there, I will teach my classmates to hunt in the mountains and eat green onions and chili peppers, so that everyone will love life in Beidahuang.

Liang Jun and her classmates in the Department of Agricultural Machinery should have graduated in the summer of this year, but because all the courses that should be studied have been completed, they graduated early to support land reclamation and participate in production.

    梁军大学已毕业
    将回到北大荒去
    新华社7日讯　新华社记者朱继功报道：我国第一个女拖拉机手梁军，现在已读完了大学四年的课程，在北京农业机械化学院毕业了。今天，她对记者说：“我将像回娘家一样回到北大荒去支援垦荒！”她现在正在收拾行装，准备在一周后和同班同学们一道出发。
    这位才二十七岁的工农出身的女大学生回忆起刚进大学时的情景，她说：像我这样的女孩子能上大学，怎不叫人高兴呢？第一年学微积分，听课像乘飞机那样迷迷糊糊的。突破困难没有别的窍门，白天黑夜地干，不懂别装懂，向老师、同学请教。后来就渐渐地能够跟上了。她最后一学期的学习成绩是四分。
    解放前，她家庭贫苦，上了四年小学就辍学了。1948年学当拖拉机手，在1951年以三个月时间突击补习初、高中的主要课程以后进了这个学院。
    当记者问起梁军去支援垦荒有什么困难时，她说，“垦荒”这两个字对我来说是很亲切的。垦荒不会有什么不能克服的困难。我是从北大荒来的，到了那儿，我将教同学们到山上去打猎，吃大葱和辣椒，使大家热爱北大荒的生活。
    梁军和她的农业机械系的同班同学本应在今年暑期毕业，因为应该学的课程都已读完，为了支援垦荒，所以提前毕业参加生产。
