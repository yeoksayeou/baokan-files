    Lhasa, February 2nd (Xinhua News Agency) - Today is the first day of the Tibetan New Year. With the New Year upon us, Lhasa's annual "Monlam" (prayer festival) is fast approaching. The tall flagpoles erected on Barkhor Street in the city have already been replaced with new scripture banners; the water pumps and taps that supply water to the lamas during the Monlam have been installed. In recent days, people can be seen everywhere busily preparing for the New Year and the Monlam, and the market is gradually becoming more active. Butter tea, roasted barley flour, sweets for the New Year, barley seedlings, poplar and birch twigs, and colorful wheat ears have been put on the market in large quantities. Recently, a large number of oranges and other fruits have also been transported to the market from Yadong and other places.
    Lamas and Tibetan farmers and herdsmen from all parts of Tibet and Qinghai, Sichuan and other places who have come to Lhasa to participate in the Monlam are increasing in number every day. In the four suburbs of Lhasa, many new tents have been added in the last few days.
    The Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China have decided that Tibetan cadres in all organs will have a three-day holiday during the Tibetan New Year, and Han cadres will also have a one-day holiday.

    藏历新年在拉萨
    新华社拉萨2日电  今天是藏历新年正月初一。进入新年，拉萨市一年一度的“传召”（祈祷会）就快到了。市内八角街上竖立着的几根高大旗杆，已经换上新的经布；供给喇嘛在传召期间吃水的抽水机和自来水管已经安装完毕。最近几天来，到处可以看到人们在为迎接新年和传召大会忙碌着，市场逐渐活跃了，酥油、糌粑、过年用的糖果、青稞苗、杨树桦树条、彩色麦穗等已大量上市，市场上新近还由亚东等地运来大批橘子等水果。
    从西藏各地和青海、四川等地赶来拉萨参加传召大会的喇嘛和藏族农、牧民，最近每天都有增加。在拉萨四郊，这几天新增加了许多帐篷。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会和中共西藏工委决定在藏历新年期间，各机关藏族干部放假三天，汉族干部也放假一天。
