Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 2nd. A week-long campaign to prevent and control overwintering rice stem borers is currently underway in many agricultural cooperatives in Sichuan Province. Tens of thousands of agricultural cooperatives in Jiangjin, Luzhou, and other special districts have already cleared the rice stubble remaining in wheat, rapeseed, and broad bean fields (where stem borers overwinter) last month. Although most of the rice stubble in the province's more than 30 million mu of winter paddy fields was turned into the mud last year, a small portion still protrudes above the water surface, creating opportunities for stem borers to overwinter. These days, cooperative members are trampling them into the mud. In many plains and hilly areas, groups of people controlling borers can be seen everywhere; agricultural cooperatives in Jiangjin, Nanchong, Yibin, and other places have also launched red flag competitions for borer control.
    Stem borer is a major pest of rice in Sichuan Province. According to reports from plant disease and insect pest forecasting stations and points throughout the province, the overwintering density of stem borers in various places this year is about twice as high as last year. Therefore, if prevention and control are not carried out early, stem borers may occur in large numbers throughout the province this year, seriously endangering rice growth and causing reduced production. In order to support agricultural cooperatives in preventing and controlling insect pests, the agricultural and supply and marketing departments of Sichuan Province, in addition to organizing the transfer and allocation of a large number of insecticides and machinery to the countryside, are also vigorously organizing agricultural cooperatives to remove rice stubble, using this most economical and fundamental method to prevent the occurrence of stem borers.

    四川许多农业社
    开展防治越冬螟虫运动周
    新华社成都2日电  一个防治水稻越冬螟虫的运动周，目前正在四川省的许多农业社展开。江津、泸州等专区的数万个农业社，在上月已经将残留在小麦、油菜和蚕豆田里的稻桩（螟虫藏在里面越冬），普遍清除一次。全省三千多万亩冬水田的稻桩，去年虽然已经大部翻入泥水中，但仍有一小部分露出水面，造成螟虫越冬机会。这几天，社员们正在把它们踩入泥里。在许多平原和丘陵地区，到处可以看到治螟的人群；江津、南充、宜宾等地的农业社，还展开了治螟的红旗竞赛。
    螟虫是四川省水稻的主要害虫。据全省各地的植物病虫害预测预报站、点的报告：今年各地螟虫越冬的密度比去年约增加两倍左右。因此，如不及早防治，今年全省螟虫可能大量发生，严重危害水稻生长，造成减产。四川省的农业、供销部门，为了支持农业社防治虫害，除组织调运大批杀虫药械下乡外，还大力组织农业社清除稻桩，用这个最经济最根本的办法来防治螟虫发生。
