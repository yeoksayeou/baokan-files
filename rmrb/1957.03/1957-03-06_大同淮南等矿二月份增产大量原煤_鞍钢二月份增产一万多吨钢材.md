Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th. The Datong Mining Bureau, Yangquan Mining Bureau, Xishan Mining Bureau and Fenxi Mining Bureau, which increased production by more than 65,000 tons of raw coal during the Spring Festival, overfulfilled the plan by 35,440 tons of raw coal in February.
    Some people were once worried that coal mines that persisted in production during the Spring Festival would find it difficult to complete their production plans in February. However, after the coal miners finished their production increase activities during the Spring Festival holiday, they immediately devoted themselves to the production increase and economization campaign to overfulfill the February plan. The attendance rate of each mine generally remained at about 80%.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 5th. In the first two months of this year, the Huainan Coal Mine employees overfulfilled the state production plan. Together with the more than 21,000 tons of coal produced during the Spring Festival, a total of 71,691 tons of raw coal were produced for the country.
    At the beginning of this year, the Communist Party committees at all levels in the Huainan Coal Mine strengthened political and ideological education for employees, overcame the slackening thoughts that were relatively common among employees, and revised the production quotas in a timely manner, so that the majority of employees maintained a full labor mood.
    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 5th. In February, Anshan Iron and Steel produced more than 17,000 tons of steel for the country, and 13 major products such as pig iron and steel also overfulfilled the February plan.
    The workers of the First Primary Rolling Mill are particularly energetic in the production increase and economization campaign. They also cherish machinery and electrical equipment and pay attention to improving operating skills. Therefore, they overproduced more than 5,400 tons of steel billets for the country. The employees of large, medium, small and medium-plate rolling mills have properly arranged the supply of raw materials and gas and improved their technology. They can not only complete tasks according to the order plan and increase production by more than 10,000 tons of steel for the country, but also significantly improve the quality. The first-class product rate of the large rolling mill exceeded the plan by 4.82%, the first-class product rate of the medium-plate mill also increased by 3.5% compared with the plan, and the small rolling mill modified the hole pattern and improved the operation method, and the qualified rate of rivet steel also increased significantly.
    The Iron Smelting Plant, which has not completed the plan for several consecutive months, also produced more than 2,600 tons of pig iron for the country this month. The production situation of the No. 7 and No. 9 blast furnaces, which had the worst production situation in the past, has begun to improve. The average daily iron production of these two blast furnaces has increased by more than 100 tons compared with January.
    The First Steelmaking Plant paid attention to strengthening equipment maintenance, shortening the time for repairing open-hearth furnaces and refining furnaces, thereby increasing the steelmaking time, and produced more than 2,000 tons of steel for the country this month.

    大同淮南等矿二月份增产大量原煤
    鞍钢二月份增产一万多吨钢材
    据新华社太原4日电　在春节期间增产了六万五千多吨原煤的大同矿务局、阳泉矿务局、西山矿务局和汾西矿务局，2月份又超计划生产了三万五千四百四十吨原煤。
    有人曾经担心春节坚持生产的煤矿，2月份将难于完成生产计划。但是，煤矿工人在结束了春节假期中的增产活动以后，便立即投入了超额完成2月份计划的增产节约运动。各矿的出勤率普遍保持在80％左右。
    据新华社合肥5日电　淮南煤矿职工在今年的头两个月中，都超额完成了国家生产计划，连同春节期间增产的二万一千多吨煤炭在内，共为国家增产了七万一千六百九十一吨原煤。
    今年初，淮南煤矿中共各级党委对职工加强政治思想教育，克服了职工中较普遍存在的松劲思想，并且及时地修改生产定额，使广大职工保持了饱满的劳动情绪。
    新华社鞍山5日电　2月份鞍钢为国家增产了一万七千多吨钢材，生铁、钢等十三种主要产品也都超额完成了2月份的计划。
    第一初轧厂的工人们在增产节约运动中的生产劲头特别大，他们又非常爱护机械和电气设备，注意提高操作技术，因而为国家超额生产了五千四百多吨钢坯。大型、中型、小型和中板等各轧钢厂的职工们，因为妥善地安排了原料和煤气的供应工作，改进了技术，不仅多能按定货计划完成任务，为国家增产了一万多吨钢材，而且质量也有显著的提高。大型轧钢厂产品的一级品率超过计划4.82％，中板厂的一级品率也比计划提高3.5％，小型轧钢厂修改了孔型、改进了操作方法，铆钉钢的合格率也有显著提高。
    已经连续好几个月没有完成计划的炼铁厂，这个月也为国家增产了二千六百多吨生铁。过去生产情况最不好的七号、九号高炉，生产情况开始好转，这两座高炉每天平均所生产的铁已经比1月份增加了一百多吨。
    第一炼钢厂注意加强设备维护工作，修理平炉和炼炉的时间都缩短了，因而增加了炼钢的时间，这个月又为国家增产了二千多吨钢。
