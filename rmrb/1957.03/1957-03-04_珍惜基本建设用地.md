Editorial Notes

    Cherish Basic Construction Land
    Saving land in basic construction is an important aspect of increasing production and practicing economy. In the past, many regions did not pay enough attention to this aspect, resulting in the long-term abandonment of much fertile land due to premature and excessive land requisition. This represents a significant waste for the country.
    Today’s news in this newspaper regarding Taiyuan City’s focused inspection of land use in factories and mines is of great significance. Returning requisitioned but unused land to farmers for cultivation can not only save factories and mines a compensation fee but also increase grain production for the country. It is hoped that relevant departments in all provinces and cities will conduct an inspection of factory and mine construction land use soon, handing over temporarily unused land to farmers for cultivation. In the future, factory and mine construction units should also meticulously prepare land use plans in the spirit of saving land; if plans change, it is best to return the requisitioned but unused land in a timely manner; for land needed for phased construction, it is best to requisition it in batches.

### 珍惜基本建设用地

    珍惜基本建设用地
    在基本建设中节约用地，是增产节约的一个重要方面。过去，许多地区对这一方面重视不够，因为过早过多地征购土地，使不少良田长期荒芜。这对国家是一个很大的浪费。
    今天本报发表的太原市重点检查厂矿使用土地情况的消息，有重大的意义。把征购未用的土地交给农民耕种，不仅可以使厂矿节省下一笔补偿费，还可以为国家增产很多粮食。希望各省市有关部门都能在最近对厂矿建设用地进行一次检查，将暂时不用的土地交给农民耕种。各厂矿建设单位今后也应该本着节约用地的精神，周密地作好用地计划；如计划变更，最好将征了不用的土地及时退掉；分批建筑所需要的土地，也最好分批征用。
