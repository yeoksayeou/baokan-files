Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, March 13th: With the spring plowing season about to begin in full swing, all localities should quickly reverse the phenomenon of neglecting agricultural technology extension work. This was emphasized by a person in charge of the Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture in a conversation with a Xinhua News Agency reporter.

This person in charge said: Currently, many places in Hunan Province have not given sufficient attention to agricultural technology extension work. At present, among the more than 6,000 technical cadres in the province's 523 grassroots agricultural technology extension stations, most are not engaged in professional activities and have been transferred for a long time to engage in central rural work. Therefore, some places cannot prevent and control swine and bovine plague in time when it occurs; farmers have created many new agricultural implements and require assistance in solving some technical problems, but no one provides guidance. Agricultural technology extension work lacks specific leadership. Therefore, many agricultural cooperatives, although they have formulated production plans, have failed to propose specific technical measures. Some places have also seen erroneous practices such as changing dense planting to sparse planting, changing improved varieties to inferior varieties, and abandoning new agricultural implements to reuse old ones. Last year, the province trained more than 210,000 technical backbones. This year, in addition to some counties such as Liling, Shimen, Wangcheng, and Changsha, which have trained a group of agricultural cooperative technicians, many places have not yet carried out this work.

This person in charge pointed out: The main reason for the above phenomenon is that the leading departments in some places do not have a sufficient understanding of the complexity and importance of agricultural technology extension after collectivization. In last year's production upsurge, they demanded too much and too fast, and when technical guidance could not keep up, they blindly promoted it to the lower levels with administrative orders. For example, they blindly promoted double-cropping rice in cold paddy fields, steep mountain fields, or waterlogged fields, resulting in reduced production and failure, which aroused farmers' dissatisfaction. Therefore, this year, cadres have developed negative and withdrawn emotions and dare not boldly lead the masses, resulting in the technical guidance work being left to its own devices.

This person in charge said: Hunan has a large population and little land, and agricultural production increase mainly relies on improving yield per unit area. If there is a lack of correct technical guidance and unreasonable use of land, labor, and means of production, the superiority of the cooperatives cannot be better utilized. Therefore, all localities should quickly allow the cadres of agricultural technology extension stations to return to their posts, give play to their enthusiasm, and vigorously promote various technical measures in a manner appropriate to local conditions and in a down-to-earth manner. Each cooperative should also establish a technical research group and experimental fields to carry out technical research activities.

This person in charge said that in the technical extension work, we should comprehensively summarize last year's work and formulate this year's technical measures through holding technical training classes and technical conferences. For advanced experiences and new technologies, we must distinguish which are effective in increasing production and can be widely promoted, which can only be promoted under certain conditions, and which are not sufficiently grasped and should only be used for key experiments. Those that are completely ineffective must be stopped. He said that Liling County, which did not fully realize the goal of the "thousand-jin yield movement" last year, is carrying out technical extension work in this way this year. Because the county has found the reasons for last year's bumper and poor harvests technically through summary and appraisal, the masses have high confidence in improving farming techniques this year.

### 湖南省忽视农业技术推广工作  大多数农业技术人员没有从事业务活动，农副业生产缺乏技术指导

    湖南省忽视农业技术推广工作
    大多数农业技术人员没有从事业务活动，农副业生产缺乏技术指导
    新华社长沙13日电  春耕就要全面开始，各地应该赶快扭转忽视农业技术推广工作的现象。这是湖南省农业厅负责人在和新华社记者的一次谈话中强调指出的一个问题。
    这位负责人说：当前，湖南省许多地方对农业技术推广工作还没有给予足够的重视。现在全省五百二十三个基层农业技术推广站的六千多个技术干部中，大多数没有从事业务活动，被长期调派搞农村中心工作去了。因此，有些地方猪牛瘟疫发生后不能及时防治；农民创造出许多新式农具要求帮助解决一些技术上的问题，也无人进行指导。农业技术推广工作缺乏具体领导，因此，有很多农业社虽然订了生产计划，但是未能提出具体的技术措施。有些地方还出现密植改稀植、良种改劣种和放弃新式农具重用旧式农具等错误做法。去年全省共训练了二十一万多个技术骨干，今年，除醴陵、石门、望城、长沙等部分县已训练了一批农业社的技术员外，很多地方还未进行这项工作。
    这位负责人指出：产生以上现象的主要原因是有些地方的领导部门对合作化后农业技术推广的复杂性和重要性认识不足。在去年生产高潮中要求得过多过猛，技术指导工作跟不上来就用行政命令盲目地向下面推广。如在冷浸田、山峭田或渍水田里盲目地推广双季稻，结果减产失败，引起农民不满。因此，今年干部又产生消极退缩情绪，不敢大胆领导群众，致使技术指导工作放任自流。
    这位负责人说：湖南人多地少，农业增产主要靠提高单位面积产量，如果缺乏正确的技术指导，土地、劳动、生产资料不合理利用，合作社的优越性就不能更好的发挥出来。因此，各地应该赶快让农业技术推广站的干部归队，发挥他们的积极性，因地制宜实事求是地大力推广各项技术措施。每个社也应该建立技术研究小组和试验田，开展技术研究活动。
    这位负责人说，在技术推广工作中，应该通过举办技术训练班和召开技术会议等形式全面总结去年工作，订出今年的技术措施。对先进经验和新技术，要分清哪些是增产有效可以普遍推广，哪些只能在一定条件下推广，哪些把握不足只作重点试验，完全无效的必须停止。他说，去年搞千斤丰产运动没有完全实现的醴陵县，今年就是这样进行技术推广工作的。这个县由于通过总结鉴定，使群众从技术上找到了去年丰收欠收的原因，因此，今年改进耕作技术的信心都很高。
