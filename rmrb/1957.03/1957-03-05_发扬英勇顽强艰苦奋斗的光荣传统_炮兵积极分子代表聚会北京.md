    Carry Forward the Glorious Tradition of Heroism, Tenacity, and Hard Work
    Artillery Activist Representatives Gather in Beijing
    According to Xinhua News Agency on the 4th, the Chinese People's Liberation Army Artillery Activist Representatives Conference opened in Beijing today.
    There are six hundred and fifty-five activist representatives and representatives of advanced units attending the conference. Among them are representatives of artillery companies whose predecessor was the artillery battalion of the Red Army's Third Army Group in 1929, which has repeatedly made military exploits and achieved excellent training results over the years; artillery soldiers from the company where the People's Hero Dong Cunrui belonged during his lifetime, which has been named the "Dong Cunrui Class"; and the famous combat hero Chang Enju, who has been awarded five first-class merits and eight third-class merits, and has achieved new results in training, and others.
    At the opening ceremony, Lieutenant General Qiu Chuangcheng, Political Commissar of the Artillery, delivered the opening address. When he talked about the difficult and glorious road that the Chinese People's Liberation Army Artillery has traveled, he said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army has had artillery since the "August 1st" Army Day in 1927. In the long-term struggle against domestic and foreign enemies, the artillery has carried forward the glorious tradition of heroism, tenacity, and hard work, and it has written a brilliant chapter in the history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. During the Anti-Japanese War, although the environment was very difficult, artillery was established in various base areas, and it exerted its power in the operations to combat the Japanese invaders. Especially due to the wise foresight of the Party Central Committee, the Artillery School was established in Yan'an, which trained a large number of artillery cadres and prepared the backbone for the development of the artillery. During the Liberation War, the Chinese People's Liberation Army seized a large number of artillery pieces and equipment from the enemy, and the artillery made great progress; in the third year of the war, the artillery became a powerful arm of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In the Liaoshen Campaign, the Pingjin Zhang Campaign, the Huaihai Campaign, and the Crossing-the-Yangtze Campaign, the artillery exerted its powerful power, cooperated with the infantry to annihilate a large number of the enemy's elite troops, and achieved a decisive victory in the war. Since the founding of our country, due to the great development of socialist industrialization and agricultural cooperativization, the people of the whole country have provided great support to their army, and the construction of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Artillery has also entered a new stage with leapfrog development. The artillery units guarding the coastal defense front day and night, with all officers and soldiers giving full play to their high degree of combat enthusiasm, have excellently completed the tasks of suppressing enemy artillery fire and air defense, escorting, and protecting fishing, while fighting and training, and have continuously improved their combat effectiveness.
    Lieutenant General Qiu Chuangcheng said that especially in 1956, under the encouragement of the upsurge of the national socialist revolution, the artillery units launched a mass training upsurge, and a large number of advanced figures and units emerged, making the modernization of the artillery achieve more remarkable achievements.
    He said that the purpose of our conference is to commend the advanced and exchange experiences. Therefore, the representatives are required to introduce their advanced experiences to others in the spirit of "offering treasures"; at the same time, the representatives are required to learn from others' experiences in the spirit of "cherishing treasures"; so that all comrades can make progress together and strive to build a strong and modern people's artillery!
    General Zhang Aiping, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the General Staff Department, and General Guo Tianmin, Deputy Minister of the Training and Supervision Department, gave instructions to the representatives at the meeting.

    发扬英勇顽强艰苦奋斗的光荣传统
    炮兵积极分子代表聚会北京
    据新华社4日讯  中国人民解放军炮兵积极分子代表会议，今天在北京开幕。
    出席会议的积极分子代表和先进单位的代表有六百五十五名。他们当中，有前身是1929年红军第三军团炮兵营、多年来屡建战功、训练成绩又优良的炮兵连队的代表，有人民英雄董存瑞生前所在连队的、已命名为“董存瑞班”的炮兵战士，有立过五次大功、八次小功的著名战斗英雄、在训练中取得了新的成绩的常恩举等。
    在开幕式上，炮兵政治委员丘创成中将致开幕词。他谈到中国人民解放军炮兵走过的艰难而光荣的道路时说，中国人民解放军远自1927年“八一”建军起，就有了炮兵。在对国内外敌人进行长期斗争中，炮兵发扬了英勇顽强、艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，它在中国人民解放军的历史上写下了光辉的篇幅。在抗日战争时期，虽然环境很艰苦，各个根据地也都建立了炮兵，在打击日寇的作战中发挥了它的威力。特别是由于党中央的英明预见，在延安开办了炮兵学校，培养了大批炮兵干部，为炮兵的发展准备了骨干。解放战争期间，中国人民解放军从敌人手中缴获了大量的火炮、器材，炮兵有了巨大的发展；在战争的第三年，炮兵就成为中国人民解放军的一个强大的兵种。在辽沈战役、平津张战役、淮海战役和渡江战役中，炮兵发挥了强大的威力，配合步兵歼灭了敌人的大量精锐部队，取得了战争的决定性的胜利。我国建国以来，由于社会主义工业化和农业合作化的巨大发展，全国人民对自己的军队提供了巨大的支援，中国人民解放军炮兵的建设也随之进入了新的阶段，有了飞跃的发展。日夜守卫在海防前线的炮兵部队，全体官兵发挥了高度的战斗积极性，在一边战斗、一边训练的情况下，出色地完成了压制敌人炮火和防空、护航、护渔等任务，并且不断提高了战斗力。
    丘创成中将说，特别是1956年度，在全国社会主义革命高潮的鼓舞下，炮兵部队掀起了群众性的训练高潮，涌现了大批先进人物和单位，使得炮兵的现代化建设，取得了更为显著的成就。
    他说，我们这次会议的目的是为了表扬先进、交流经验，因此要求代表们以“献宝”精神把自己的先进经验介绍给别人；同时又要求代表们以“爱宝”精神把别人的经验学到手；以使全体同志共同进步，为建设一支强大的现代化的人民炮兵而奋斗！
    总参谋部副总参谋长张爱萍上将、训练总监部副部长郭天民上将，在会议上对到会代表作了指示。
