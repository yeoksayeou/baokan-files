    The Craze of Britons Emigrating Abroad
    Recently, the British Prime Minister and ministers have repeatedly promoted the "great spirit" of Britain in their speeches. For example, Macmillan reminded the British people in a speech: "Our current situation is difficult, and all kinds of things can go wrong. But our people don't care... We have always relied on our character, our strength, our knowledge, and our wisdom to live our best days."
    Long Queues for Emigration Applications
    There is a good reason for the British Prime Minister and ministers to talk like this. According to the American "Newsweek," it is to "restore British confidence." Since the failure of the war of aggression against Egypt, many British people have felt serious unease about the future of their country and themselves. As a result, there has been a craze for emigration abroad. In front of the immigration offices in London of federal countries such as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, long queues form every morning. They brave the cold to queue up in order to obtain visas for these countries as early as possible. American "Newsweek" reported that as many as three thousand people apply for such visas to the Canadian immigration office every day.
    Astonishing Public Opinion Poll
    A recent British public opinion poll provided an even more astonishing figure. 41% of Britons hope to emigrate abroad. 12% are hesitating. People from all walks of life are willing to leave Britain, most of whom are technicians, intellectuals, and even young students. A recent poll at Cambridge University showed that three out of ten male students and four out of ten female students want to live abroad after graduation.
    What are the Reasons?
    What kind of uneasy feeling makes so many British people prefer to leave their own country and move to remote and unfamiliar foreign lands? The Roper couple, who are workers, put forward a representative answer. (See the British "Worker's Daily" on February 19) Roper said: "If I lose my job now, I will have to move out of my residence and look for the same job elsewhere, or change careers... and my income will decrease..." Roper's wife has her own ideas, she said: "I am worried about the future of my children... there are too many wars and war talks... if another world war breaks out... at least we can be safer than on this small island." American "Newsweek" pointed out that the reasons for this widespread unease can be attributed to the heavy burden of taxes (the current income tax in Britain is the highest in the world), the fear of unemployment, and the fear of war.
    The "Manchester Guardian" has warned that since most of those who are willing to leave Britain are skilled young people, who are the "knowledge" and "strength" on which the British economy depends, a large outflow will be a serious loss to the British economy. (Lin) (with picture)

### 英国人移居国外的热潮

    英国人移居国外的热潮
    近来，英国首相和大臣们在讲话中反复宣扬英国的“伟大精神”，例如麦克米伦在一次演说中提醒英国人民说：“我们目前的处境困难，各种事情都会出毛病。但是我国人民并不在乎……我们向来就是依靠我们的性格，我们的力量，我们的知识以及我们的智慧，过我们最好的日子。”
    申请移居的长龙
    英国首相和大臣们的这种谈论大有缘故。照美国“新闻周刊”的说法，是要“恢复英国的信心”。原来自从侵略埃及战争失败后，英国许多人对于自己国家和个人的前途感到严重的不安。因此出现了一股移居国外的热潮。加拿大、澳大利亚和新西兰等联邦国家驻伦敦的移民办事处门前，每天大清早，就排起了长龙似的队伍。他们不顾寒冷来排队，是想及早取得这些国家准予移居的签证。美国“新闻周刊”报道，向加拿大的移民办事处申请这种签证的每天有三千人之多。
    惊人的民意测验
    最近举行的英国民意测验提供了一个甚至更为惊人的数字。41％的英国人希望移居国外。12％的在犹豫中。愿意离开英国的人各阶层都有，最多的是技术人员、知识分子以至青年学生。剑桥大学最近一次民意测验表明，在十个男学生中，就有三个，在十个女学生中就有四个，想在毕业后住到国外去。
    什么原因
    是一种什么不安的感觉使得这样大批的英国人宁愿离开自己的祖国，移居到遥远和陌生的异乡去的呢？工人罗伯夫妇提出了一个具有代表性的答案。（见2月19日英国“工人日报”）罗伯说：“如果我现在失业，我就得搬出我的住所，到别处寻找同样的职业，或者改行……而收入就要下降……。”罗伯的妻子却另有她的想法，她说： “我担心孩子的前途……战争和战争的言论太多了……一旦发生另一次世界大战……至少我们可以比在这个小岛更安全一些。”美国“新闻周刊”指出，造成这种普遍不安的原因，归结来，不外就是赋税的重担（目前英国的所得税是世界最高的）、失业的恐惧以及害怕战争的心理。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”已经提出警告说，由于愿意离开英国的人多半是有技术的年青人，这些人是英国经济所依赖的“知识”和“力量”，因此大批的外流对英国经济将是一个严重损失。　（林）（附图片）
