　　A Large-Scale Historical Chronology

　　The book "Chronology of Major Events in Chinese and Foreign History," chief edited by Professor Jian Bozan, head of the History Department of Peking University, is about to be published by the People's Publishing House. This book starts from ancient times and ends in 1955, with a total of about 1.2 to 1.3 million words, making it a large-scale historical chronology. At a time when there are not many reference books, the publication of this chronology is a welcome event.

　　The compilation of this book has taken a long period, starting in 1947. Initially, it was written by Professor Jian Bozan alone. At that time, his life was mobile, and his work was intermittent. He compiled it for four years, and the first draft was completed in 1950. Initially, he only intended to compile a Chinese history chronology, but later changed his plan to add a foreign history section and expand the Chinese history section. Professor Jian Bozan invited Professors Liu Qige, Qi Sihe, and Nie Chongqi to participate in the compilation work in 1948 and 1951 successively. Professors Liu Qige and Qi Sihe were responsible for the compilation and translation of the foreign history section; Professors Jian Bozan and Nie Chongqi were responsible for supplementing the "Jian's Initial Draft." Now the book is completely finished.

　　In addition to arranging historical facts according to the year and month like general chronologies, the editors consciously paid attention to selecting the following items: 1. Inventions and improvements of production tools and production technology in various periods; 2. Land system and farmland water conservancy; 3. Economic measures and taxation system; 4. Commodity exchange and coin minting; 5. Political reforms and promulgation of codes; 6. Class struggle, including political changes and infighting within the ruling class; 7. Birth and death dates of important historical figures (including famous politicians, military strategists, philosophers, historians, writers, and artists), especially the inventions and discoveries of scientists. In addition, special attention was paid to recording the distribution and movement of various tribes, races, and nations in history, and to recording the wars and peaceful exchanges between countries in history.

　　Regarding the handling of historical materials of various eras, this book implements the principle of "detailed present and brief past." The closer to modern and contemporary times, especially the years after liberation, the greater the proportion. For example, in the modern Chinese history section, various important historical events during the establishment, development, and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in the two revolutionary processes are recorded in the chronology, including the publication or publication dates of Chairman Mao Zedong's important works and papers. In terms of foreign history, the founding dates of the Comintern and communist parties of various countries are also recorded in the chronology. In addition, attention was paid to recording the national revolutionary movements in Eastern countries.

　　The intention of the editors of this book is to show the context of China's economic, political, and cultural development through the order of the years, and to show the mutual relationship between countries in historical development, especially the historical relationship between China and other countries in the world, through the juxtaposition and comparison of Chinese and foreign historical events. In these aspects, this book has achieved certain results. However, it is inevitable to produce the shortcomings of dividing the same historical fact into several places due to the arrangement of historical facts by year and month in the chronology.

### 一部规模较大的历史年表

　　一部规模较大的历史年表
    由北京大学历史系主任翦伯赞教授主编的“中外历史大事年表”一书，即将由人民出版社出版。这部书上起远古，下迄1955年，全书约一百二三十万字，是一部规模较大的历史年表。在工具书不多的现在，这部年表的出版，是一件可喜的事。
    这部书的编纂，经过了较长的时期，开始于1947年。最初由翦伯赞教授一人编写，当时他的生活流动，工作时断时续，编了四年，到1950年才完成初稿。最初只打算编一本中国史年表，以后改变计划，增加外国史部分，并把中国史部分加以扩充，由翦伯赞教授于1948和1951年先后约请刘启戈、齐思和、聂崇岐三位教授参加编纂工作；刘启戈、齐思和两位教授担任外国史部分的编译工作；翦伯赞和聂崇岐教授担任增补“翦编初稿”的工作。现在这部书已全部脱稿。
    这部年表除了和一般的年表一样，按照年月编次史实外，编者还有意识地注意了选录下列的事项：一、各时期的生产工具和生产技术的发明和改进，二、土地制度和农田水利，三、经济措施和赋税制度，四、商品交换和钱币铸造，五、政治改革和法典的颁行，六、阶级斗争，包括统治阶级内部的政变、混战，七、重要历史人物的生卒年代，（包括著名的政治家、军事家、哲学家、史学家、文学家、艺术家）特别是科学家的发明与发现。此外还特别注意记录历史上各部族种族和民族的分布与移动，注意记录历史上各国之间的战争与和平往来。
    对于各时代史料的处理，本书贯彻“详今略古”的原则，愈到近代现代，特别是解放以后的年代，分量愈多。例如在中国近代史部分，对于中国共产党的成立、发展和领导两个革命过程中的各种重要的历史事件，都记入年表；包括毛泽东主席的重要著作、论文的出版或发表年月在内。在外国史方面，共产国际和各国共产党成立的日期，也都记入年表。此外还注意了记录东方各国的民族革命运动。
    本书编者的意图是想通过年代的顺序，显示出中国经济、政治和文化发展的脉胳，通过中外历史事件的并列和对比，显示出各国之间在历史发展中的相互关系，特别是中国与世界各国的历史关系。在这些方面，本书取得了一定成绩。但也不免产生年表按年按月编排史实，因此将同一史实分割数处的缺点。
