Xinhua News Agency, March 6th. The Chinese People's Liberation Army Artillery Exhibition Hall, which opened in Beijing on the 4th, displays the world's oldest cannons, various new cannons, and various physical objects, charts, and models of the development history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Artillery.

The armaments hall of the exhibition hall displays all kinds of cannons, like a miniature of the development history of cannons from ancient times to the present, both Chinese and foreign. Among them are: two bronze cannons cast in the eleventh year of the Zhizheng reign of the Yuan Dynasty (1351 AD) and the fifth year of the Hongwu reign of the Ming Dynasty (1373 AD), which are even earlier than the iron hand cannon collected by the Fuller Museum in the United States from 1380. There is a rocket (model) invented by Tang Fu in the Song Dynasty in 1000 AD, which has the same basic principle as modern rockets; there is a large bronze cannon named "Wucheng Yonggu Great General" cast in the twenty-eighth year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty (1689 AD), weighing more than 10,000 catties and capable of loading 10 catties of gunpowder and 20 catties of bullets; there are cannons from Britain, Germany, France, Japan, and the United States captured by the Chinese people in various anti-aggression wars over the past century; and there are various new cannons used by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Artillery.

In the military history hall of the exhibition hall, various physical objects, charts, models, etc. are displayed, introducing the development history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Artillery from scratch and from small to large. A striking statistical chart indicates: During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army captured more than 300 enemy cannons; during the Anti-Japanese War, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army captured more than 2,000 enemy cannons; during the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, the Chinese People's Liberation Army captured more than 50,000 enemy cannons. Here also hangs an oil painting of the artillery in the "August 1st" Nanchang Uprising in 1927, with Comrades Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and He Long directing the mountain guns to bombard the enemy. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has had artillery since the day it was founded. This artillery participated in the five anti-"encirclement and suppression" struggles and the 25,000-li Long March. Zhao Zhangcheng, a former artilleryman who used thirty-one artillery shells to cover the seventeen Red Army warriors crossing the Dadu River and is now an artillery major general, introduced the battle situation at the time next to the electric sand table of the Red Army crossing the Dadu River.

Also displayed here are: inscriptions by Comrades Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, etc., on the occasion of the first anniversary of the establishment of the Artillery Regiment of the Eighth Route Army Headquarters during the Anti-Japanese War; a Zeiss-style artillery mirror that Comrade Zhou Enlai personally sent someone to buy from Wuhan; the plaque of the gate of the Yan'an Artillery School during the Anti-Japanese War; elm-made cannons used by the militia of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region; and photos and charts of the artillery's participation in the Pingxingguan battle, the Hundred Regiments Offensive, and the persistence in fighting behind enemy lines.

Also displayed here are "meritorious cannons" and banners indicating the achievements of the artillery during the War of Liberation. During the strategic defense phase, the East China Artillery participated in the seven battles and seven victories in Central Jiangsu, the Suqian-Bei battle, and the Lunan battle; the Northeast Artillery participated in the three campaigns south of the Yangtze River and the four defenses of Linjiang; the Northwest Artillery participated in the defense of Yan'an in the situation of lack of grain and ammunition; during the strategic offensive phase, the artillery participated in the Liaoshen, Huaihai, and Pingjin Zhang campaigns, which determined the victory of the Chinese Revolutionary War, and then participated in the battles to advance into Jiangnan, liberate Central South, Southwest, and the coastal islands of Southeast China. All of this is fully explained in sand tables, charts, physical objects, and photos.

Also displayed here are models and explanatory materials on the Chinese People's Liberation Army's shelling of Jinmen, cooperating with the army, navy, and air force to liberate Yijiangshan Island, and defending the motherland's coastal defense and carrying out modernization and regularization construction during the period of defending the motherland's construction.

In the training hall of the exhibition hall, more than 600 inventions and rationalization proposals made by the broad masses of artillery commanders and soldiers in training are displayed, fully reflecting the wisdom and perseverance shown by the artillery officers and soldiers in modernization construction.

The artillery exhibition hall is expected to be on display for three months and will receive visits from personnel from the military, government agencies, universities, and people's organizations.

    展览馆的兵器馆里陈列了各种各样的大炮，它犹如一部古今中外大炮发展史的缩影。其中有：比美国福瑞尔博物馆所藏1380年铁制火铳还早的、元代至正十一年（公元1351年）和明代洪武五年（公元1373年）铸造的两尊铜炮。有宋代唐福在公元一千年发明的与现代火箭基本原理相同的火箭（模型），有清代康熙二十八年（公元1689年）铸造的重一万多斤、能装十斤火药和二十斤弹丸、名为“武成永固大将军”的大铜炮，有近百年来我国人民在历次反侵略战争中缴获的英国、德国、法国、日本和美国等国家的大炮，还有中国人民解放军炮兵使用的各种新式大炮。
    在展览馆的军史馆里，陈列了多种多样的实物、图表、模型等，介绍了中国人民解放军炮兵从无到有、从小到大的发展历史。一张引人注目的统计图表上标明：第二次国内革命战争时期的工农红军，缴获敌人大炮三百余门；抗日战争时期的八路军和新四军，缴获敌人大炮两千多门；第三次国内革命战争时期，中国人民解放军缴获敌人大炮五万多门。这里还悬挂着一幅1927年“八一”南昌起义中的炮兵的油画，周恩来、朱德和贺龙同志正指挥着山炮向敌人轰击。中国人民解放军自建军那天起就有了炮兵。这支炮兵参加了五次反“围剿”的斗争，参加了两万五千里的长征。前来参观的当年以三十一发炮弹掩护红军十七勇士抢渡大渡河的神炮手、现在的炮兵少将赵章成，在红军抢渡大渡河的电动沙盘旁边，介绍了当时的作战情景。
    这里陈列的还有：抗日战争时期八路军总部成立炮兵团一周年时，毛泽东、刘少奇、周恩来、朱德等同志的题词，周恩来同志亲自派人从武汉买来的一架蔡司式的炮队镜，抗战时期延安炮兵学校的大门匾，陕甘宁边区赤卫队用榆木制的火炮，以及炮兵参加平型关大战、百团大战和坚持敌后作战的照片、图表等。
    这里陈列的还有表明解放战争时期炮兵功绩的“功勋炮”和锦旗。在战略防御时期，华东炮兵参加了苏中七战七捷、宿北、鲁南等战役，东北炮兵参加了三下江南、四保临江的战斗，西北炮兵在粮弹缺乏的情况下，参加了保卫延安的战斗；在战略进攻时期，炮兵参加了辽沈、淮海、平津张等决定中国革命战争胜利的三大战役，接着又参加了进军江南、解放中南、西南国土和东南沿海岛屿的战斗。这一切，都在沙盘、图板、实物和照片中得到了充分的说明。
