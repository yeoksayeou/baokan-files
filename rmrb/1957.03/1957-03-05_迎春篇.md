Springtime doesn't need anyone to praise it. As long as people remember the fierce cold of winter, they will naturally feel the preciousness of spring.

However, not everyone who has experienced winter understands spring. People like us, who are used to chanting "bright and beautiful spring," although we eagerly hope for the arrival of spring, when spring truly arrives and a couple of winds blow, we become impatient and ask, "What kind of spring is this? Is this what spring is like?" Clearly, there is some disappointment. What can be done? He imagined a "bright and beautiful spring" without any wind and sand, but the actual spring is interspersed with "annoying" wind and sand. The fantasy bumped into the nail of reality, but he refused to correct this fantasy based on reality. This is because: to correct this fantasy practically, one has to struggle ideologically, which is not as easy as holding on to the fantasy. But spring remains the same, so, in the end, one cannot help but be disappointed. However, this cannot be blamed on others; in reality, he does not understand that without this spring breeze, how would the river thaw, and how would the trees turn green? If it were not for the spring breeze that softened the muscles and blood of all things, and allowed Mother Earth to open her heart, then the so-called "Yangchun Qizhe" (the warm spring awakens dormant creatures) would be just empty words!

I do not complain about this spring breeze, and I believe that the spring breeze gives people more than just sand and gravel, but also spring rain and new greenery.

The spring sunshine is warm, but it also depends on whether people go to feel it. Here is a clear example: the girls who are picking wild vegetables, sweating profusely, put down their baskets and say, "The weather is really good today!" They are comfortable and happy; but the "refined ladies" hiding in their boudoirs say with a mournful face, "Why is the weather still so cold!" The reason is: the refined ladies did not go to feel the sunshine, but just sulked in their embroidery room complaining about the cold weather. I think: to prevent those refined ladies from complaining, they must be pulled out of their boudoirs and exposed to the sun until they are drenched in sweat. There is no other way.

I am not against criticism and complaining in general. Well-intentioned criticism and complaining still have some encouraging effect on those who are doing practical work; however, I still feel that it is necessary for those who criticize to understand the other side of things. Taking flower appreciation as an example: people often criticize that this flower is not good and that flower is not bright, but making flowers better is not as easy as it sounds.

In Shanghai, going to Jing'an Temple to admire peonies every year from April 18th is a grand occasion. It is said that the few peony plants planted by the abbots were passed down from their ancestors; but the attraction of the peonies to tourists does not lie in their age, but in the careful cultivation. In winter, the peonies must be wrapped in straw, and in spring, greasy oil must be applied to the roots of the peonies, and meat must be buried as fertilizer, so the flowers bloom extraordinarily.

The reason I bring this up is because I think it will be of great inspiration to those of us who only ask for appreciation and not for cultivation.

Spring is a beautiful season, and spring needs cultivation even more! Understanding this means understanding spring.

    迎春篇
    焦勇夫
    春天，原用不着谁去赞美，只要人们还记得那严冬的寒威，就自然会觉得这春天的可贵。
    然而，却又不是每个经过严冬的人，都能懂得这春天。像我们这样一些念惯了“春光明媚”的人，虽则是很希望春天的到来，但当春天真地到来，并且刮起两场风的时候，却又不耐烦了，责问道：“这叫什么春天？难道春天就是这样的吗？”显然有些失望了。有什么办法呢？他幻想的是没有一点儿风沙的“春光明媚”，而实际的春天，却又偏偏夹有“讨厌”的风沙，幻想碰了实际的钉子，可是却不肯根据实际来校正这幻想。这是因为：要脚踏实地地校正这幻想，就得思想斗争一番，实在不如抱幻想的来得轻巧；但春天却仍旧如是，所以，终于不免灰溜溜甚而是失望了。然而，这却怪不得别人，实际上是他不懂得，没有这春风，河将怎样解冻，树又怎样吐青？倘使不是这春风揉开了万物的筋血，使地母敞开她的胸怀，那所谓“阳春启蛰”的佳句，不过是空话而已！
    我不埋怨这春风，并且以为这春风给人们的不止是砂砾，还有春雨和新绿。
    春天的阳光是温暖的，但也要看人们去不去感受。下面就是一个明显的例子：采摘野菜的姑娘，晒得满头大汗，放下筐来第一句就是：“今儿天真好！”她们舒畅而且快意；但躲在幽闺里的“大家闺秀”却哭丧着脸子说：“天怎么还这么冷清清！”原因是：大家闺秀并没有到阳光底下去感受一番，而只是闷在绣房里怨天冷。我以为：要使那大家闺秀不抱怨，就得将她从幽闺中拉出来晒她个香汗淋漓，此外则别无他法。
    我并不是一概反对指责和抱怨，善意的指责和抱怨，对于那些实干的人也还不无策励的作用；不过我终于还觉得，要那些指责者明白事情的另一面也是必要的。如以赏花为例：常有人指责这花不好那花不鲜艳，但是要使花变好，可就不像说的那么容易。
    在上海，每年4月18到静安寺观赏牡丹，是极一时之盛的。据说，方丈们种的几株牡丹，是他们的祖师传下来的；但那牡丹的吸引游客并不在于资格老，而是在于培养的精心。到得冬天要把那牡丹用稻草裹起来，春天要给牡丹根上抹荤油，还要埋下肉去作肥料，故而花开得不同凡俗。
    我所以举出这件事来，是因为觉得它对我们那些只问欣赏、不问耕耘的人会有很大的启发。
    春天是美丽的季节，春天更需要耕耘！懂得了这，才算懂得了春天。
