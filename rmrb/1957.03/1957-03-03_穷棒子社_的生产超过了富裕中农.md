    "Poor Stick Cooperative's" Production Exceeds That of Wealthy Middle Peasants

    92% of Members Have Surplus Grain

    In the high tide of the socialist revolution, our "Poor Stick Cooperative," which was once ridiculed, has expanded and upgraded. The entire cooperative has 549 households. Of the more than 24,800 mu of land, over 17,000 mu are barren mountains, over 1,000 mu are river flats, and the remaining 6,000-plus mu of cultivated land are mostly terraces and slopes. The small amount of flat land in the mountain gullies is mostly sandy with little soil, yielding only a few dozen catties of grain per mu in the past. Before liberation, people lived in extreme poverty, and more than 20 peasant households relied on begging for a living year-round. After the land reform, although people received land and their lives improved somewhat, the small-scale peasant economy could not withstand natural disasters and man-made calamities. As people often said, "Peach blossoms bloom red for a moment in March, but a gust of wind and rain washes them away," and they could not recover from natural disasters. Before the establishment of the cooperative in 1952, although the government provided 180,000 catties of grain and 400 pieces of clothing in relief each year, many people still lived with insufficient food and clothing. After the establishment of the cooperative in the autumn of 1952, production increased year by year, and living conditions improved daily. After transitioning to a high-level cooperative in the late winter of 1955, there was a complete hope of changing the impoverished situation. After a year of hard work, all kinds of crops achieved bumper harvests. The average grain yield per mu was 440 catties, an increase of 66% compared to 1955; cotton was 180 catties, an increase of 125% compared to 1955; peanuts were 270 catties, an increase of 50% compared to 1955. These yields exceeded the production level of wealthy middle peasants before they joined the cooperative and completed the production level stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) to be achieved within twelve years ahead of schedule. Forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations also developed, with fruit trees alone generating an income of more than 13,000 yuan. The autumn harvest distribution resulted in 16 catties of grain and 8 jiao in cash per labor day; each person received 1 catty of cotton and 22 catties of peanuts. The average income per household was 536.9 yuan, and the average income per person was 110.4 yuan. Except for two households with large populations and few laborers who received 6 or 7 yuan less than in 1955, the remaining 547 households all increased their income. Liu Cunwang, who had the highest income, received more than 14,800 catties of grain and more than 740 yuan in cash, several times more than in 1955. After the distribution, people were overjoyed, beaming with smiles, and unanimously reflected: "The cooperative is very good," "The cooperative saved our lives," "If it weren't for the cooperative, I wouldn't even have a kang."

    According to the "three fix" production targets, we originally needed the state to supply 190,000 catties of grain. Now, not only do we not need the state to supply, but we also sold 150,000 catties of surplus grain. 92% of the members have become surplus grain households, and the 34 semi-agricultural households with a grain shortage were also resolved by the cooperative. The living standards of the members have generally risen to the level of middle peasants. They eat semi-thick and semi-dry food, wear cotton clothes in winter, lined clothes in autumn, and single clothes in summer. Housing has also greatly improved. In the past year, more than 200 houses have been newly built and renovated, and more than 200 are under construction or planned for construction.

    With the improvement of material life, cultural life has also improved. All school-age children in the cooperative are attending school, and more than 330 young and middle-aged people are studying in literacy groups, higher primary classes, and middle school classes. Every morning and evening, the club broadcasts radio programs; during festivals, the library and the sports field are filled with people, some reading books and some playing ball.

  How Production Increased

    Advanced cooperativization and the National Agricultural Development Program have greatly encouraged us. After transitioning to a high-level cooperative, all members, under the slogan of "Transforming Poor Mountains into Granaries," conducted comprehensive planning to increase production and focused on the following tasks:

    The first task is to increase fertilizer application. "Abundant manure and diligent watering, no need to ask anyone," is a well-known experience for increasing production. However, due to being busy with the merger and upgrading of the cooperative, less fertilizer was accumulated in the winter of 1955, and there was a deep sense of insufficient fertilizer during spring plowing. Relying on livestock to accumulate manure was too slow; digging black mud was not enough; buying chemical fertilizer was not only expensive, but also unavailable even with money. What to do? At this difficult time, some members suggested implementing the Hongguang Cooperative's method of smoking soil to accumulate fertilizer. The cooperative adopted this suggestion. However, some members did not agree. They said, "Each place has its own customs, what works for Hongguang Cooperative may not work here." "Smoking soil in the freezing weather is a waste of effort." The cooperative did not force them to comply, but sent several activists to study at Hongguang Cooperative. After they returned, they first experimented in the 14th team. The result was successful, and then everyone was called to observe. Seeing that the smoked soil was "almost the same" as the soil from the kang, fine and black, they were extremely happy. From then on, the movement to smoke soil and accumulate fertilizer developed smoothly. In order to push the movement to a climax, the cooperative researched a method of calculating work points for smoking soil and accumulating fertilizer, stipulating that 4 work points would be recorded for every 100 catties of black soil. When members cooked every day, they first filled some soil into the stove, and when the rice was cooked, the soil was also blackened. This is a very good fertilizer. Everyone called this method "burning pot bottom fertilizer." In this way, the difficulty of lacking fertilizer was solved by collective and individual smoking of soil, plus human and animal manure. Each mu of land was applied with eight cartloads of base fertilizer and four cartloads of top dressing, exceeding the amount of fertilizer applied in any previous year. This is the first move we were able to increase the unit area yield of farmland.

    The second task is to build water conservancy projects. Here, it is drought when it is sunny, and floods and waterlogging when it rains. These are disasters that have been impossible to overcome for years. After advanced cooperativization, with more people and greater strength, we used this unparalleled superior condition to determine to overcome drought, flood, and waterlogging disasters. But at the beginning, many people thought that "digging ditches and opening canals is both labor-intensive and land-wasting, and not worth the loss"; some people thought that "diverting water up the mountain is unprecedented and may not work well." In response to this situation, everyone was given a detailed account of the benefits of preventing drought, flood, and waterlogging, reasonably arranged labor, and first opened a section of canal to test the water. When river water and spring water flowed obediently through the ditches and canals, people were excited and happy. I was also very excited, because we had diverted water up the mountain and done something that our predecessors had not done. Thus, the work of digging ditches and opening canals began. A 5,100-zhang drainage ditch was dug along the foot of the mountain, freeing more than 820 mu of land from floods and waterlogging; also repaired and newly opened five 8-li-long irrigation canals, diverting river water and spring water for irrigation, turning more than 4,000 mu of dry land into irrigated land. This is the second move we were able to increase the unit area yield of farmland.

    The third task is to improve technical management. In the promotion of new technologies such as seed selection, seed mixing, dense planting, pest control, and artificial pollination, as with smoking soil and accumulating fertilizer and digging ditches and opening canals, many people initially disagreed. At the mention of dense planting, members started arguing: one said "joking," the other said "nonsense." What to do if we cannot compromise conservative thinking and cannot force orders? The cooperative established a technical school to carry out technical education; summarized the experience of the eighth team's high-yield corn dense planting in 1955, and used facts to educate everyone. This made the members believe in the benefits of dense planting, cultivated a large number of technical talents, and promoted advanced agricultural technology. This is the third move we were able to increase the unit area yield of farmland.

    We have a lot of barren mountains and wasteland here. Fully utilizing these lands is also an important way to increase agricultural production. But at the beginning, many members were not interested. They said, "There is no idle land, all the land that can be cultivated has been cultivated." "We are already busy with serious work, how can we have the leisure to do this? We can't fill our stomachs with the food on the edge of the bowl." "It's enough to eat without doing it, the corners of the land don't count for anything." Although the cooperative made a call, more than a month passed, and except for the youth commando team that opened up more than 100 mu of wasteland, the other members did not even lift a hand. In order to change this situation, a cadres' meeting was held to check and correct the cadres' problem of only making general calls without specific arrangements, and the "six checks" were carried out with the 14th team as the focus: check barren mountains, check abandoned roads, check the ends of the fields, check the sides of the fields, check the riverbanks, and check the edges of the villages. As a result, more than 80 mu of usable land were found, and a plan for reclamation, planting, and income and expenditure was made. Immediately afterward, a meeting of all production team cadres in the cooperative was convened, and the typical facts of the 14th team were used to encourage the enthusiasm of the members to reclaim wasteland. The entire cooperative successively reclaimed a total of more than 970 mu of idle land, planted crops such as grain, cotton, oilseeds, and vegetables, and earned more than 22,800 yuan. This is also an important move that my cooperative was able to increase production.

      Develop Diversified Operations

    We have many mountains and narrow land here. Relying solely on agriculture cannot make everyone rich. We must develop diversified operations. Our cooperative operates more than 2,000 mu of fruit trees, and universally carries out scraping, whitewashing, pruning, fertilizing, spraying, and loosening soil, thereby changing the old habit of only harvesting fruit and not managing it, and improving the yield of fruit trees. The cooperative has also developed animal husbandry. The entire cooperative publicly raises 169 head of cattle, 536 sheep, and 150 pigs. Of these livestock, except for 63 cattle that were contributed by members when they joined the cooperative, the rest are all self-bred and self-raised by the cooperative. The cooperative has trained more than 20 breeders to specialize in raising livestock; implemented a contract-based reward method and established a responsibility system. As a result, the livestock are fattened, the survival rate is improved, and the development of livestock is greatly promoted. The cooperative also operates more than ten kinds of sideline production such as flour mills, tofu workshops, wood industry, leather industry, sewing, weaving, transportation, firewood chopping, and grass cutting, earning more than 2 million yuan.

    The family sideline occupations of the members have also developed. Currently, there are pig raising, chicken raising, rabbit raising, firewood chopping, grass cutting, etc. Here, let's just talk about pig raising. So far, members have raised 1,090 pigs individually, an increase of more than 40% compared to 1955. Except for 13 single men and five-guarantee households who did not raise pigs, the rest of the members all raised pigs, generally raising two, and the most raised 19. But developing pig raising is not without difficulties. Many members are unwilling to raise them. They say, "It's not enough for people to eat, what can we feed the pigs?" "We don't even have money to buy salt, how can we have money to buy pigs?" In order to solve this problem, the cooperative took out more than 1,000 yuan and more than 100 publicly owned piglets, lent them to members without pig capital, and returned them after the pigs grew up and were sold; the cooperative provided labor and materials to build 57 pig pens for members without pig pens; the cooperative was fully responsible for the pig's epidemic prevention expenses. The cooperative buys household fertilizer from members and prices it according to quality. The cooperative's breeders often go to the members' homes to help improve feeding and management.

  The Bigger the Cooperative, the More Important it is to Save Expenses

    With the expansion and upgrading of the cooperative, many people have developed serious extravagant and wasteful ideas. They believe that the cooperative is bigger, "everything must look like something," "everything should be fully prepared, convenient to use, and look grand." They advocated selling the cooperative's small livestock and buying large mules and horses; selling iron-wheeled carts and buying rubber-wheeled carts; replacing all old farm implements with new and uniform ones; and valuing many things that are not currently needed into the cooperative, and so on. The cooperative did not do this. According to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, the members were educated to calculate detailed accounts using the hard work and pioneering deeds of the original Jianming Cooperative. For example, buying a mule requires selling ten donkeys. In use, one mule can never replace ten donkeys; the price of one rubber-wheeled cart is equal to ten iron-wheeled carts. In mountainous areas, rubber-wheeled carts are not necessarily more convenient than iron-wheeled carts. In this way, the extravagant and wasteful thinking of some members was overcome, and the excellent style of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily was promoted. Financial contracting was implemented. According to the size of the livestock, the amount of forage was stipulated, and each production team contracted to raise them; the repair costs of farm implements were contracted by each production team at a rate of 1 jiao and 5 fen per mu of land per month; the office expenses of the cooperative should not exceed 3 yuan per month, and the team should contract to use 1 fen per mu of land per month. In order to encourage saving and overcome waste, reward and punishment measures were also formulated. The contracting unit is responsible for overspending; for saving expenses, 20% of the savings goes to the cooperative, and 80% is awarded to the contracting unit. After doing this, saving became a trend. During spring plowing and sowing, the cooperative lacked more than 20 head of livestock. No member complained and automatically replaced animal power with human power to pull carts and plows, completing the sowing task on time. The large baskets, earthen baskets, and manure baskets used by the cooperative were all made by the members themselves using the gaps in production to collect rattan on the mountains, without spending a penny. The members also repaired their own farm implements, saving all the farm implement repair costs. In addition to utilizing old materials, accumulating fertilizer themselves, etc., the money saved was no less than tens of thousands of yuan, thereby greatly reducing production costs.

      Continue to Move Forward

    Although our cooperative achieved a great harvest last year, the members were not satisfied with the harvest. As soon as the autumn harvest ended, everyone invested in winter production. Even when the north wind blows and the heavy snow falls, the members are still full of energy to carry out work such as accumulating fertilizer, transporting manure, leveling land, repairing dams, and chopping firewood, striving to achieve a greater harvest this year.

    We have also planned for the production in 1957. The yield per mu of various crops is: 473 catties of grain, 200 catties of cotton, and 300 catties of peanuts. Fruit trees will be developed to 2,500 mu, and forests to 4,200 mu; cattle will be developed to 215 head, sheep to 740, and pigs to 2,800; operating more than ten sideline productions such as brick kilns. It is estimated that each labor day will be divided into 20 catties of grain and 1.6 yuan in cash, so that 100% of the members will increase their income by no less than 35%.

    To fundamentally change the appearance of our place, it will take until 1967. If you come here again at that time, you will see: members living together in four villages, electric lights illuminating every family, making it difficult to distinguish between day and night; wide roads are connected like blood vessels, leading in all directions; the cultivated land is wide, the terrain is flat, the soil is fertile, and the canals are crisscrossed, with a grain yield of 750 catties per mu, 400 catties of cotton, and 560 catties of peanuts; the more than 4,000 mu of fruit trees on the mountains, the more than 5,000 mu of pastures, and the more than 7,000 mu of forests are lush green; the river water is clear, and the banks are green; cattle and sheep are all over the mountains, and fat pigs fill the pens, with chickens and ducks in flocks. We believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party and relying on the hard work of all members, this plan will definitely be realized. (Reporter Ke Keming of "Rural Work Communication")

    “穷棒子社”的生产超过了富裕中农
    河北遵化县建明农林牧生产合作社主任  王国藩
    92％的社员有余粮
    在社会主义革命高潮中，我们这个曾经被人讥笑过的“穷棒子社”扩大、升级了。全社五百四十九户。二万四千八百多亩土地中，荒山占了一万七千多亩，河套占了一千多亩，其余的六千多亩耕地，绝大多数还是梯田、坡地，山沟里有点儿平地，也是砂多土少，过去每亩打粮不过几十斤。解放以前，人们生活极苦，还有二十多户农民常年靠要饭生活。土地改革以后，人们虽分到了土地，生活有所改善，但由于小农经济经不起天灾人祸，还是像人们常说的“三月桃花一时红，风吹雨打一场空”，在自然灾害面前，跌倒了就爬不起来。在1952年办社以前，虽然政府每年救济十八万斤粮食和四百件衣服，但是不少人还是过着少吃没穿的生活。1952年秋季建社以后，生产逐年提高，生活日益改善。1955年冬末转为高级合作社以后，贫穷的状况才有了彻底改变的希望。经过一年的辛勤劳动，各种庄稼都获得丰收，粮食每亩平均产量四百四十斤，比1955年增加了66％；棉花一百八十斤，比1955年增加了125％；花生二百七十斤，比1955年增加了50％。这些产量，超过了入社以前富裕中农的产量水平，提前完成了全国农业发展纲要 （草案）所规定的在十二年内达到的产量水平。林业、牧业、副业也有发展，仅果树一项就收入了一万三千多元。秋收分配结果，每个劳动日分了粮食十六斤，现金八角；每人分了棉花一斤，花生二十二斤。每户平均收入五百三十六元九角，每人平均收入一百一十元四角。全社除两户人口多劳力少的社员比1955年少收了六、七元以外，其余五百四十七户社员都增加了收入。收入最多的刘存旺，分了粮食一万四千八百多斤，现金七百四十多元，比1955年增加了好几倍。分配结束以后，人们欢欣鼓舞，喜笑颜开，一致反映：“合作社好得很”，“合作社救了命”，“要不是合作社，我连炕也没有了”。
    按照“三定”产量，本来还要国家供应粮食十九万斤，现在不但不需要国家供应，我们还卖了余粮十五万斤，92％的社员成了余粮户，缺口粮的三十四户半农户，也由社里调剂解决了。社员的生活普遍上升到了中农水平。吃的是半稀半干，穿的是冬有棉衣，秋有裌衣，夏有单衣。住房也大有改善，一年来新建和翻修了二百多间房子，正在修建和准备修建的还有二百多间。
    随着物质生活的提高，文化生活也提高了。全社适龄儿童都上了学，还有三百三十多个青年、壮年分别在炕头识字组、高小班和中学班里学习。每天早、晚，俱乐部里播送着广播电台的节目；每逢节日，图书馆里和球场上都集聚着不少的人们，有的人看书，有的人打球。
  怎样增加了生产
    高级合作化和全国农业发展纲要给了我们很大鼓舞。转为高级社以后，全体社员在“变穷山为粮仓”的口号下，为了增加生产，进行了全面规划，并着重的抓住了这样几件工作：
    头一件是增施肥料。“粪大水勤，不用问人”，这是人人知道的增产经验。但是由于忙于社的合并和升级，1955年冬季积肥较少，备耕时，深感肥料不足。靠牲口积肥，来不及；挖黑泥，又没有那么多；买化学肥料，不但没钱，有钱也买不到。怎么办呢？正在这个难关上，有的社员建议实行红光社熏土积肥的办法。社里采纳了这个建议。但有些社员思想不通。他们说：“一处土地一处庙，红光社能行，我们这里未必能行。”“天寒地冻，熏土，白费劲。”社里没有强迫他们执行，派了几个积极分子去红光社留学，回来后先在十四队试验，结果成功了，随后就叫各队观摩，大家看到熏土同炕土“差不离”，又细又黑，高兴极了。从此熏土积肥料运动就顺利地开展了起来。为了把运动推向高潮，社里研究出了熏土积肥的计酬办法，规定每百斤黑土记工四分。社员们每天做饭，先在灶里填些土，饭做熟了，土也烧黑了。这是一种很好的肥料。大家把这个办法叫做“烧锅底肥”。就这样，以集体和个人熏土的办法，解决了缺乏肥料的困难，加上人、畜肥料，每亩地施底肥八车，追肥四车，施肥量超过了以往任何一年。这是我们所以能够提高农田单位面积产量的第一着。
    第二件是兴修水利。我们这里天晴即旱，天雨又洪又涝。这是历年没法战胜的灾害。高级合作化以后，人多力量大，我们利用这个无比的优越条件，下定决心战胜旱、洪、涝灾害。但一开始，好些人认为“挖沟开渠，既费工又费地，得不偿失”；有人认为“引水上山是开天辟地没有的事，不一定搞得好”。针对这种情况，给大家算了防旱、防洪、防涝好处的细账，合理地安排了劳力，先开了一段渠放水试验。当河水、泉水驯服地流过沟、渠的时候，人们兴高彩烈。我也很兴奋，因为引水上山了，我们做了前人所没做过的事业。于是，挖沟开渠工作开展起来了。沿着山脚下挖了五千一百丈的排洪沟，使八百二十多亩地摆脱了洪灾和涝灾；还修理和新开了五道八里长的引水渠，引河水、泉水灌溉，使四千多亩旱地变成了水地。这是我们所以能够提高农田单位面积产量的第二着。
    第三件是改进技术管理。在推广选种、拌种、密植、治虫、人工授粉等新技术上，也同熏土积肥和挖沟开渠一样，开头有好多人思想不通。一提到密植，社员就吵开了：这个说“开玩笑”，那个说“瞎胡闹”。既不能迁就保守思想，又不能强迫命令，怎么办呢？社里一面成立技术学校，开展技术教育；一面总结八队1955年玉米密植丰产经验，用事实教育大家。从而使社员相信了密植的好处，培养了大批技术人材，推广了先进的农业技术。这是我们所以能够提高农田单位面积产量的第三着。
    我们这里荒山废地不少，充分利用这些土地，也是提高农业生产的一个重要门路。但开头，好些社员不感兴趣。他们说：“没啥闲地了，能种的地都种上了。”“正经活还忙不开，那有闲工夫搞这个，碗边上的饭是吃不饱的。”“不搞也够吃了，地头地角算不了什么。”社里虽然作了号召，但一个多月过去了，除了青年突击队开了一百多亩荒地以外，其他社员连手也没有动。为了改变这种局面，召开了干部会议，检查和纠正了干部只作一般号召、没有具体安排的毛病，以十四队为重点进行“六查”：查荒山、查废道、查地头、查地边、查河边、查村边。结果查出了八十多亩可以利用的土地，并作了开垦、种植和收支计划。紧接着召开全社生产队干部会议，用十四队的典型事实，鼓舞了社员开荒的积极性。全社先后共开垦了九百七十多亩闲地，种了粮食、棉花、油料、蔬菜等作物，收入二万二千八百多元。这也是我社所以能够增产的重要一着。
      开展多种经营
    我们这里山多地窄，只靠农业是不能使大家富裕起来的，必须开展多种经营。我们社里经营了二千多亩果树，普遍地进行了刮皮、刷白、整枝、施肥、打药和松土，从而改变了过去只收果不管理的旧习惯，提高了果树的产量。社里还发展了畜牧业。全社公养牧牛一百六十九头，羊五百三十六只，猪一百五十头。这些牲畜，除六十三头牛是社员入社的外，其余的都是社里自繁自养的。社里训练了二十多个饲养员，专门饲养牲口；实行了包工奖励办法，树立了责任制。从而牲口养肥了，成活率提高了，大大地促进了牲口的发展。社里还经营了粉坊、豆腐坊、木业、皮业、缝纫、编织、运输、打柴、割草等十多种副业生产，收入二百万多元。
    社员的家庭副业也有发展。现在已经搞起来的有养猪、养鸡、养兔、打柴、割草等等。在这里别的暂且不谈，只谈养猪。到目前为止，社员个人养猪一千零九十头，比1955年增加了40％多，除十三户光棍汉和五保户没有养猪外，其余的社员都户户养了猪，一般的养了两头，最多的养了十九头。但发展养猪并不是没有困难的。好些社员不愿养，他们说：“人吃还不够，拿什么喂猪呢？”“买盐的钱还没有，那有钱买猪呢？”为了解决这个问题，社里拿出了一千多元和一百多头公有小猪，借给没有猪本的社员，到猪长大出卖后再归还；社里出工出料给没有猪圈的社员修了五十七个猪圈；猪的防疫费用全部由社负责。社里收买社员家庭肥料，按质论价。社里的饲养员经常到社员家里帮助改进饲养和管理。
  社大了更要节省开支
    随着社的扩大和升级，好些人滋长了严重的铺张浪费的思想。他们认为社大了，“要处处像个样子”，“任何东西都应该准备全套，用着方便，看着阔气”。他们主张把社里的小牲口卖掉，买回大骡大马；把铁轮车卖掉，买回胶轮车；把一切旧农具换成新一色的；把很多当前不需要的东西也折价入社，等等。社里没有这样做，根据中共中央和国务院关于勤俭办社的指示，用原来建明社刻苦起家的事迹，对社员进行了算细账教育，比如，买一头骡，要卖掉十头驴，使用起来，一头骡无论如何也顶不住十头驴；一辆胶轮车的价钱等于十辆铁轮车，在山地里，胶轮车不一定比铁轮车使着方便。就这样克服了部分社员的铺张浪费思想，发扬了勤俭办社的优良作风。实行了财务包干。按照牲口大小，规定草料数量，由各生产队包养；农具修理费，按每月每亩地一角五分钱，由各生产队包修；办公费，社里每月不得超过三元，队里每月每亩地一分钱包干使用。为了鼓励节约，克服浪费，还制定了奖惩办法。超额开支的由承包单位负责；节余开支的，节余部分的20％归社，80％奖给承包单位。这样作了以后，节省成了风气。春耕播种时，社里缺二十多头牲口，社员谁也没有吭气，就自动以人力代替畜力拉车、拉犁，按期完成了播种任务。社里使用的大篓、土筐、粪筐，都是一钱没花，由社员自己利用生产空隙，到山上采集荆条编成的。社员还自己修理农具，把农具修理费全部节省了下来。加上利用旧物、自己积肥等等，节省的钱不下几万元，从而大大降低了生产成本。
      继续前进
    虽然我们社去年获得了大丰收，但社员们并没有因丰收而满足。秋收一结束，大家就投入了冬季生产，就是北风吹，大雪飘，社员们还是精神百倍的进行积肥、送粪、整地、修坝和打柴等等工作，争取今年获得更大的丰收。
    我们对1957年的生产也进行了规划。各种庄稼的亩产量是：粮食四百七十三斤，棉花二百斤，花生三百斤。果树发展到二千五百亩，林木四千二百亩；牛发展到二百一十五头，羊七百四十只，猪二千八百头；经营砖瓦窑等十多项副业生产。预计每个劳动日分粮食二十斤，现金一元六角，使百分之百的社员增加的收入不低于35％。
    要从根本上改变我们这里的面貌，要到1967年。那时候如果再到我们这里来，就会看到：社员集居在四个村庄里，电灯照耀着每个家庭，难分昼夜；大车道像血管一样接联起来，四通八达；耕地宽阔，地势平坦，土质肥沃，水渠纵横，粮食亩产七百五十斤，棉花四百斤，花生五百六十斤；山上的四千多亩果树，五千多亩牧场，七千多亩林木，一片青葱；河水清秀，两岸绿荫；牛羊遍山，毛猪满圈，鸡鸭成群。我们相信，在共产党的领导下，依靠全体社员的辛勤劳动，这个计划一定能够实现。	 （“农村工作通讯”记者柯克明记）
