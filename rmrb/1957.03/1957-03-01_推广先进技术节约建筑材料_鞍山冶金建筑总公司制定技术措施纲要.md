Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 28th—The Anshan Metallurgical Construction General Company has recently formulated an outline of technical measures focused on increasing production and practicing economy.

The outline requires the adoption of over 40,000 cubic meters of prefabricated reinforced concrete components in this year's construction projects to replace steel structures.  Without affecting the lifespan of the projects, the former, when used for trusses, roof beams, supports, and other structures, can generally save about 70% of steel compared to the latter. Among these prefabricated reinforced concrete components, more than 2,000 cubic meters are prestressed.  The application of this new technology in construction projects not only improves quality compared to ordinary reinforced concrete prefabricates, but also saves more than 400 tons of steel and 20% of cement.

In Anshan, millions of tons of iron smelting slag and tailings powder discarded from ore dressing are disposed of annually. According to experiments, these are excellent building materials and will be fully utilized this year.

A type of heat-resistant concrete has been successfully tested and will be applied in some industrial furnace construction projects this year. The construction of coke ovens, iron-smelting furnaces, etc., for Anshan Iron and Steel requires more than two hundred types of odd-shaped refractory bricks, which are difficult to manufacture and build.  Using heat-resistant concrete can cast the shapes needed for the project, making construction simpler and reducing costs by 20% to 70%.

This outline of technical measures includes more than a dozen techniques for saving wood, all learned from other places or created by employees of this enterprise in the past few years, including movable wooden formwork suitable for construction sites, nail-free wooden formwork, and suspended scaffolding for bricklaying projects.  It is estimated that after the promotion of these advanced technologies, 3,500 cubic meters of wood can be saved this year.

    推广先进技术节约建筑材料
    鞍山冶金建筑总公司制定技术措施纲要
    新华社鞍山28日电  鞍山冶金建筑总公司最近制订出以增产节约为主要内容的技术措施纲要。
    这个纲要要求在今年的建筑工程上，采用四万多立方公尺装配式预制钢筋混凝土构件，代替钢结构；在不影响工程寿命的前提下，前者制造的桁架、屋梁、支柱等结构，一般能比后者节约70％左右的钢材。在这些预制钢筋混凝土构件中，有二千多立方公尺是预加应力的。在建筑工程上应用这项新技术，比一般钢筋混凝土预制品不但质量好，还能节约四百多吨钢筋，20％的水泥。
    在鞍山每年扔掉数百万吨炼铁矿渣和选矿扬弃的尾矿粉，据试验这些都是很好的建筑材料，今年将充分加以利用。
    一种耐热混凝土已经试验成功，今年将在部分工业筑炉工程上应用。鞍钢炼焦炉、炼铁炉等的砌筑工程，需要二百多种奇形怪状的耐火砖，制造和砌筑都不容易。使用耐热混凝土，就可以浇灌成工程需要的形状，施工比较简便，成本可以降低20％至70％。
    这个技术措施纲要中，有十多项节约木材的技术，都是过去几年向外地学习或本企业职工创造的；其中有适合于施工现场用的活动支木模法，无钉支木模法，砌砖工程用的悬式脚手架等。预计这些先进技术推广以后，今年可以节约木材三千五百立方公尺。
