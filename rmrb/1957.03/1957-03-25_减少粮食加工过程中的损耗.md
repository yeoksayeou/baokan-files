Grain processing plants are one of the most important links in the large-scale flow of grain. Therefore, reducing losses during processing and ensuring that every grain becomes a useful finished product is an important aspect of saving grain.

Last year, the average output rate of grain processing plants in Harbin City increased by 0.44% compared to the national standard. This single item saved 1,438 tons of grain. However, because they did not grasp the changes in grain in different seasons and appropriately change production equipment and technological procedures according to these changes, the grain output rates varied greatly. For example, in the first quarter, the grain output rate exceeded the national target by an average of 0.99%; in the second quarter, because the weather warmed up and the grain changed internally, the average output rate was down by 0.11%; in the third quarter, it exceeded by an average of 0.17%; however, in the fourth quarter, because the moisture content of the grain was too high, it could not reach the level of the first quarter. From the above situation, if the grain industry could reach the level of the first quarter in all four quarters, the grain processing plants in Harbin City alone could save 3,200 tons of grain annually.

Within the same quarter, the output rate also varies when processing the same grade of finished product from different grades of raw grain, or when processing different grades of finished product from the same grade of raw grain. For example, processing Grade 2 or 3 rice from Grade 3 paddy can exceed the output rate by 0.5% to 1%; processing Grade 1 rice will result in a loss of 0.5% to 0.1%. In addition to some problems with the calculation standards, the main reason is that production technology cannot adapt to the characteristics of various grades of grain. At the same time, there is an imbalance between factories and production teams. To eliminate the imbalance in output rates, we must start from the following aspects.

First, conduct regular and comprehensive technical measurements of production equipment. In combination with technical measurements, make detailed records of the equipment specifications and operating techniques used for different seasons and for processing grain of different properties. At the same time, conduct accurate and frequent chemical analysis of raw grain, semi-finished products, finished products, and by-products to promptly identify the causes of grain loss, so as to improve production equipment and technical operations in a timely manner.

Second, strictly control product quality. In 1956, 20,000 tons of products from grain processing plants in Harbin City were returned for reprocessing because the product quality did not meet national standards. These grains suffered a loss of 200 tons after being re-processed. Another deviation in quality is that some rice mills are afraid of producing unqualified products and control the precision too high. For example, the rice processed by the First Rice Mill had its precision increased by half a percent, resulting in a loss of more than 13,000 kilograms of rice in two months. Therefore, strengthen the inspection and analysis of product quality, implement multiple departmental samples, implement a quality responsibility system, promote the experience of quality certificates, reduce returned products, and strictly control the phenomenon of excessively high quality, so that products meet quality standards. At the same time, vigorously carry out the work of eliminating impurities, and strive to make rice and grain reach the "four no's rice": no gravel, no bran, no grains of rice, and no weeds.

Third, clean up by-product grain in a timely manner. At present, most factories take out part of the grain when clearing barnyard grass, rice straw and other debris from the rice. For example, at present, the barnyard grass removed in many factories contains 8% to 15% of grain, with the highest reaching 60%; it is common for rice straw to contain 30% to 40% of grain. If equipment and operation methods can be improved, grain losses can be reduced and eliminated.

Last year, grain processing plants in Harbin City created a lot of experience in this area. The Sixth Rice Mill installed a small steel mill in the corn residue processing workshop to grind the skins and some small residues (which were previously used as chicken feed) cleared during processing into flour. This flour meets the standard of first-class corn flour; in this way, it produced more than 300 tons of edible grain for the country in one year. The Third Rice Mill processed the barnyard grass cleared from the rice into barnyard grass rice, which can be used to make pancakes or cook porridge, and has the same nutritional value as millet. In addition, the coarse bran peeled from rice grains contains very small, prematurely dead, unripe broken rice grains and small rice tips, which can be cleared with a sieve. If these many methods can be widely promoted, the amount of grain saved will be considerable.

Fifth, strengthen the technical strength of workshops. Many signs indicate that production teams with more veteran workers have higher output rates, while production teams with more new workers not only have low output rates, but also often make mistakes in production, directly causing waste of grain. Because the new workers in the rice processing workshop of Harbin First Rice Mill did not adjust the wind power of the suction box properly, they sucked out rice three times in less than a month due to excessive wind, each time more than 200 kilograms. This shows that skilled technology and rich experience are important for improving output rates. Unfortunately, in recent years, many highly skilled foremen have been transferred to do administrative work. However, because these people have a low level of education, they cannot play a role in administrative work. To solve the problem of workers' skills, in addition to strengthening education and improving the existing technical level, the most important thing is to mobilize this part of the old workers who are doing administrative work to return to the workshop to participate in production.

Actively carrying out pest control and eliminating "four pests" is also important for saving grain. At present, this work is the weakest link in the entire grain department. In the future, we must continue to organize employees to carry out activities to eliminate "four pests" and prevent grain insects, and strive to become a "four no's" processing plant.

Under the rapid development of national socialist construction and the continuous growth of the living standards of the working people, saving grain is of utmost importance. Therefore, in the movement to increase production and practice economy, educating employees to cherish grain, actively carrying out activities to save grain, checking and opposing the phenomenon of wasting grain, and organizing employees to tap potential, find tricks, put forward rationalization proposals, and reduce the waste of grain can not only save a large amount of grain, but also improve the technical level of grain processing.

　　减少粮食加工过程中的损耗
　　马守春
    粮食加工厂是粮食大量流动的重要环节之一，因此，减少加工过程中的损耗，争取每一粒粮食都成为有用的成品，这就成为节约粮食的一个重要方面了。
    去年，哈尔滨市各粮食加工厂，平均出品率比国家标准提高了0.44％，单这一项，就节约了一千四百三十八吨粮食。但是因为没有抓住不同季节粮食的变化情况，并根据这些情况适当的改变生产设备和工艺规程，因而，粮食的出品率相差很大。如第一季度，粮食的出品率平均超过国家指标0.99％；第二季度因为天气变暖，粮食内部起了变化，平均出品率就亏了0.11％；第三季度平均超过0.17％；但是第四季度因为粮食水分过大，没能达到第一季度水平。从上述情况看来，粮食工业如果四个季度都能达到第一季度的水平，仅哈尔滨市的粮食加工厂，全年就可以节约粮食三千二百吨。
    在同一个季度之内，不同等级的原粮加工同等级的成品，或同等级的原粮加工不同等级的成品，出品率也不一样。如三等稻子加工二三等大米，出品率能超过0.5％至1％；加工一等大米就要亏0.5％至0.1％。除了计算标准存在一些问题以外，主要是生产技术还不能适应各种等级的粮食性质。同时厂与厂、生产小组之间也不平衡。要消除出品率的不平衡现象，须从下面几个方面着手。
    第一、对生产设备进行定期的、全面的技术测定，结合技术测定，对不同季节、加工不同性质的粮食所使用的设备规格和操作技术，作详细的记录。同时对原粮、半成品、成品和副产品进行准确、经常性的化学分析，及时发现粮食损耗的原因，以便适时地改进生产设备和技术操作。
    第二、严格控制产品质量。1956年哈尔滨市各粮食加工厂，因产品质量不符合国家标准，返机品有二万吨，这些粮食经过再一次的磨擦，损失达二百吨。在质量上的另一个偏向是，某些米厂怕生产不合格品，精度控制过高。如第一制米厂加工的大米，精度提高了半成，两个月就损失大米一万三千多公斤。因此，加强产品质量的检验分析，实行多种分部样品，贯彻质量责任制度，推广质量合格证的经验，减少返机品和严格控制质量过高的现象，使产品符合质量标准。同时要大力开展消灭含杂的工作，争取使米粮达到无砂石、无糠皮、无谷粒、无草子的“四无米”。
    第三、及时清理下脚粮。目前，大部分工厂从稻子中清除稗子、稻草和其他杂物的时候，都带出一部分粮食。如目前不少厂在清除出的稗子中，含粮食达到8％到15％，最高的达到60％；稻草中含有粮食30％到40％的是普遍现象。如果能改进设备和操作方法，粮食的损耗是可以减少和消灭的。
    去年哈尔滨市各粮食加工厂在这方面创造了很多经验。第六制米厂，在加工玉米渣子车间，安装了一台小钢磨，把加工中清出的皮子和一部分小渣子（过去都当鸡饲料）磨成面粉，这种面粉符合一等玉米面的标准；这样一年之内，就为国家多出三百多吨可以食用的粮食。第三制米厂，把从稻谷中清出的稗子加工成稗子米，可以摊煎饼或是煮稀饭，营养价值和小米一样。另外从稻谷剥下来的粗糠中，含有很小的早死未熟的破碎稻粒和小稻粒尖子，经过一道筛子就可以清出。这许多办法，如果能普遍推广，节约粮食的数目是相当可观的。
    第五、加强车间的技术力量。很多迹象表明，老工人多的小组出品率就高，相反的新工人多的小组，不仅出品率不高，还往往会在生产上出差错，直接造成粮食的浪费。哈尔滨第一制米厂稻子加工车间，因为新工人没有调整好吸风箱的风力，不到一个月，就因为风大吸出去大米三次，每次二百多公斤。由此说明，熟练技术，丰富经验，对提高出品率是重要的。可惜几年来，很多技术很高的工长被抽出去做行政工作去了。而这些人因为文化低，做行政工作发挥不了作用。解决工人技术问题，除了加强教育并提高现有技术水平以外，最主要的是动员这一部分做行政工作的老工人，回车间参加生产。
    积极开展防蛀和除“四害”工作，对节约粮食也很重要。目前这项工作，是整个粮食部门最薄弱的一环。今后要继续组织职工开展除“四害”和防治粮虫的活动，争取成为“四无”加工厂。
    在国家社会主义建设飞快发展、劳动人民生活水平不断增长的情况下，节约粮食有着极其重要的意义。因此，在增产节约运动中，对职工爱护粮食的教育，积极开展节约粮食活动，检查和反对浪费粮食的现象，组织职工挖潜力、找窍门、提合理化建议、减少粮食的浪费，这不仅可以节约大批粮食，而且还可以提高粮食加工的技术水平。
