I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's report. I fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the Standing Committee of this association, Vice Premier Chen Yun's explanation on increasing production and practicing economy, and Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation on the Second Five-Year Plan. I would now like to provide some information and opinions on agricultural cooperation and agricultural production issues:

	Great Achievements, Shortcomings in Progress

First, let's talk about the development of agricultural cooperation and last year's agricultural production.

Agricultural cooperation has been basically completed; most crops increased in production last year despite major disasters; seventeen counties and cities achieved the twelve-year target for grain output stipulated in the Draft National Agricultural Development Program.

Last year was a year of surging agricultural socialist transformation and a production upsurge in China's rural areas. It was also the first year of implementing the Draft National Agricultural Development Program. We basically completed agricultural cooperation last year (except for some minority ethnic regions). To date, the number of farm households joining advanced cooperatives has reached over 90% of the total number of farm households nationwide, with a total of 746,100 agricultural production cooperatives established (averaging 190 households per cooperative). From then on, Chinese farmers have broken away from the shackles of the individual economy, eradicated the roots of poverty, and embarked on the socialist road of ensuring common prosperity. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, this is a victory of "a large-scale socialist revolutionary movement of over 500 million rural people, with extremely great world significance."

Last year's agricultural production also achieved new major victories. Although last year was hit by severe floods, wind disasters, and droughts unseen in decades, with disasters greater than in 1954, the vast majority of various crops achieved increased production. Let's look at the comparison between the output of various major crops last year and the bumper year of 1955: grain was 368.6 billion jin, an increase of nearly 20 billion jin, or an increase of 5.4% (an increase of nearly 50 billion jin compared to 1954). Soybeans were 20.5 billion jin, an increase of 12.8%. Cotton was 30.5 million dan, a slight decrease, but other regions generally had bumper harvests except for disaster areas. Peanuts were 68.78 million dan, an increase of 17.5%. Ramie was 1.09 million dan, an increase of 11.9%. Flue-cured tobacco was 8.62 million dan, an increase of 44.8%. Rapeseed was 19.69 million dan, a slight increase. Sugarcane was 180.94 million dan, an increase of 11.6%. Sugar beets had a slight increase. Only sesame and flax decreased in production slightly. The above figures show that our agricultural production achievements last year were very significant.

It is also important to point out a significant fact. According to existing materials, seventeen counties and cities across the country achieved the twelve-year target for grain output stipulated in the Draft National Agricultural Development Program last year. These seventeen counties and cities are Longxi, Haicheng, and Changle counties in Fujian Province; Chaoan, Puning, Jieyang, Chaoyang, Nan'ao, and Chenghai counties in Guangdong Province; Xiaogan and Huangpi counties in Hubei Province, all of which reached an average yield of over 800 jin per mu, with nine counties reaching an average yield of over 1,000 jin per mu. Huang County in Shandong Province and Zhengding County in Hebei Province reached an average yield of 500 jin per mu. Gaocheng County in Hebei Province, Chang'an County and Xianyang City in Shaanxi Province, and Meng County in Henan Province reached an average yield of 400 jin per mu. This is a fact that deserves great attention. This fact fully proves the correctness of the Draft National Agricultural Development Program formulated under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and also fully demonstrates that the victory of cooperation has created the possibility for improving agricultural production and ensuring the coordinated development of industry and agriculture.

Many major changes have taken place on the agricultural production front, ensuring a significant increase in agricultural production; the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives are well-run

Why were we able to achieve such significant production increases in the first year after full agricultural cooperation, and under the circumstances of encountering major disasters? What major changes have taken place on the agricultural production front last year?

First, due to the victory of cooperation, the enthusiasm of farmers for labor production has greatly increased. The characteristic that the new agricultural production upsurge coincided with the cooperation upsurge is a full proof of this. The timely proposal of the twelve-year National Agricultural Development Program has further encouraged the production enthusiasm of farmers. Everywhere we can see that in rural areas that have been cooperatized, the number of people participating in labor production has increased unprecedentedly, with an average increase of about 20% in general rural areas. The attendance rate of labor has generally increased, generally increasing by about 20%. Labor efficiency is also gradually improving and continues to improve. Due to the unified use of labor and the implementation of division of labor, it is possible to truly make the best use of everyone's talents. The increase in labor and the improvement in labor productivity are a new and extremely significant change, which is the basis for cooperatives to increase production faster and more than individual farmers, and it is the reliable basis for the superiority of the cooperative system.

Second, due to cooperation, means of production and production funds, especially land and labor, can be concentrated, unified, and rationally utilized in a planned way, creating the possibility for larger-scale and faster development of agricultural capital construction. For example, the irrigated area of farmland water conservancy projects built last year reached 150 million mu (100 million mu benefited in the same year). This is equal to half of the irrigated area with water conservancy facilities in China's history before liberation, equal to 200% of the irrigated area developed in the six years after liberation, and equal to more than double the target of the First Five-Year Plan. The area of soil and water conservation completed last year reached 66,300 square kilometers, equal to the total area completed in the six years after liberation. More than 30 million mu of new wasteland was reclaimed, equal to 80% of the target of the First Five-Year Plan. The afforestation area reached about 4 million hectares, which is also unprecedented. The above figures show that last year's agricultural capital construction achievements were unprecedentedly huge. The shortcoming is that the quality of about 5% of farmland water conservancy projects is very poor, and some "rejects" have appeared. The treatment of soil and water conservation areas is not enough, and agriculture, forestry, and water still lack necessary cooperation. The survival rate and preservation rate of afforestation are also very poor in some places, resulting in some waste of labor. All of these are related to reasons such as overly high planning requirements from the leadership and the lack of technical guidance. We should pay attention to avoiding these shortcomings.

Third, due to cooperation, it also creates new and favorable conditions for larger-scale improvement of the farming system, improvement of production technology, development of intensive farming, improvement of soil, and improvement of land fertility. Last year, the area of dry land converted to paddy fields reached 14.3 million mu. For example, the paddy fields converted in one year in several northeastern provinces are equal to the total amount of all paddy fields in history. The multiple cropping index increased by 4.4% compared to 1955, which is equal to an increase of more than 99.6 million mu of sown area, which is the largest increase since liberation. The promotion of improved varieties, for grain alone, increased by 240 million mu compared to 1955, equal to one-third of the existing improved varieties area in the country. The main cotton producing areas have achieved full use of improved varieties. Appropriate dense planting and insect eradication and other technologies have also been promoted on a large scale than in the past. In terms of accumulating fertilizer and making fertilizer, it also exceeded any previous year. For example, Hebei Province accumulated more than 8.4 billion dan of fertilizer, an increase of more than three times over previous years. Guangdong accumulated more than 4.2 billion dan of fertilizer, an increase of more than three times compared to 1955. Most other provinces have increased by one to two times compared to previous years. According to existing materials, the above-mentioned technical measures taken last year, calculated only from the results of converting dry land to paddy fields, increasing double-cropping rice, and converting low-yield crops to high-yield crops, increased grain production by 12 billion jin. From this, it can be seen that the achievements of the above-mentioned production increase measures are very significant and are the main ones. But it is not without shortcomings. According to surveys in various places, 80% of the promotion of technical improvements was successful, 15% had some problems, and 5% were wrong. Some places even caused serious losses. All of these are mainly due to the lack of experience of cadres in leading large-scale cooperative production, or the leadership's overly urgent requirements, which violated the principle of adapting to local conditions. This lesson should be taken seriously.

Fourth, due to the above-mentioned superior conditions of cooperation, the disaster resistance ability shown by cooperatives last year was also huge, which is incomparable to the individual economy. The provinces that suffered severe droughts last year were Hunan and Guangxi, followed by Jiangxi. The provinces that suffered severe floods and wind disasters were Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Zhejiang, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. In total, the national affected farmland area reached more than 220 million mu. Among them, in addition to 80 million mu that were lost due to destructive disasters, the rest were greatly reduced due to the cooperative's disaster resistance struggle, avoiding more production reductions. For example, most areas of Guangxi Province suffered severe drought from the beginning of August last year to the beginning of January this year, with an affected area of more than 10 million mu (out of more than 30 million mu of cultivated land in the province), but last year's grain output decreased by only several hundred million jin compared to 1955. The situation in other severely affected provinces is roughly the same, except for individual provinces. It should be said that in a heavy disaster year like last year, grain production increased by 5.4% compared to the previous year's bumper year, and the vast majority of economic crops increased production to varying degrees. This cannot be said to be a random phenomenon.

The above is the new change that has taken place on the agricultural production front in the past year. This is also the root cause of why significant increases in agricultural production could be achieved last year under the circumstances of severe disasters. It can be seen that the above-mentioned new major changes were generated on the basis of the victory of cooperation, and it is unimaginable to be separated from the victory of cooperation. This undoubtedly fully proves the great superiority of agricultural cooperation.

The facts of the production and distribution summary of agricultural production cooperatives last year also tell us that the vast majority of cooperatives across the country are well-run, and those that are poorly run account for about 5%. In non-disaster areas or areas with minor disasters, about 80% of the cooperatives have increased production to varying degrees, and 75% of the members have increased their income to varying degrees. For example, according to a survey of 114 cooperatives in Henan Province (including 42 cooperatives in grain producing areas, 23 cooperatives in economic crop areas, 19 cooperatives in mountainous areas, 5 cooperatives in urban suburban areas, and 25 cooperatives in disaster areas), 78 cooperatives increased production, accounting for 68.4%, and 36 cooperatives reduced production, accounting for 31.6%. This is a total calculation of non-disaster areas and disaster areas. If only the 89 cooperatives in non-disaster areas are calculated, 73 cooperatives increased production, accounting for 82%. These cooperatives increased production by an average of 10.84% compared to 1955, and if disaster area cooperatives are excluded, the average increase is 17.77%. From the perspective of cooperative members' income, among these 114 cooperatives, 11 cooperatives guaranteed increased income for more than 90% of the members, 22 cooperatives guaranteed increased income for 80%-90% of the members, 36 cooperatives guaranteed increased income for 60%-80% of the members, and 45 cooperatives guaranteed increased income for less than 60% of the members. Even in disaster areas, although production was reduced or lost due to severe natural disasters, the lives of cooperative members were still guaranteed through cooperative organization of production for self-rescue, coupled with government assistance. I surveyed several representative cooperatives in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture and Guilin Special Zone in Guangxi at the end of last year, and the situation there was roughly the same as in Henan. If the basic situation in Henan and Guangxi, which suffered severe disasters, is good, then the provinces with bumper harvests last year will be much better. For example, according to a survey of more than 30,000 advanced cooperatives and more than 30,000 elementary cooperatives in Hubei, 92% of the former and 86% of the latter increased production. The cooperative members who increased their income generally accounted for 84% in the province, 8% maintained their income, and only 7% reduced their income. The lives of farmers in these areas have been further improved in the first year of cooperation. These facts fully prove that the estimate that the vast majority of cooperatives were well-run last year is correct. Precisely because of this, the vast number of farmers who participated in the cooperatives support the cooperatives, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants before joining the cooperatives have shown more determination. Only a small number of the original wealthy farmers have some dissatisfaction due to temporary reductions in income and other reasons. We believe that this situation will gradually change after a certain period of time with the improvement of cooperative production. These are the basic situations in the development of agricultural cooperatives last year.

The victory of agricultural production last year and the basic situations of the development of agricultural cooperation in the past year give us full reason and full confidence to say that our cooperation has achieved great success. Although this success has just begun in most areas and still needs our long-term (three to five years) efforts to consolidate it. However, these successes have once again fully proved that the principles and policies of agricultural cooperation stipulated by the CPC Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong are completely correct, and also show that our leadership organs at all levels, especially the vast number of rural cadres, have made arduous and arduous efforts.

	Affirm achievements, properly criticize shortcomings, consolidate victories, and continue to move forward

Agricultural cooperation and last year's agricultural production activities also have shortcomings and errors. Some shortcomings and errors have occurred in the operation and management of cooperatives, production guidance, the implementation of mutually beneficial policies, and the handling of internal relationships. In addition to what was pointed out earlier, for example, many cooperatives had overly high production plan targets last year; a short-term neglect of sideline production; the current lack of reasonable balance between production and capital construction, that is, the arrangement of long-term interests and immediate interests is not appropriate enough; the production needs and the daily life needs of the members are not fully taken care of, that is, the handling of collective interests and the personal interests of the members is not reasonable enough; in the improvement of production technology, some places were not adapted to local conditions, resulting in some losses; livestock management was also very poor in some places, causing some abnormal deaths. In a word, the operational management is not good and the policy of running cooperatives democratically and thriftily has not been fully implemented. Also, due to various reasons, such as some members reducing their income (generally about 5%-10% nationwide), or due to the poor implementation of mutually beneficial policies and other reasons, some members in individual places had trouble withdrawing from the cooperative last winter. All these shortcomings and errors have attracted attention, and have been gradually discovered and corrected since last summer, and are still being corrected.

Why do these shortcomings and errors occur? Everyone knows that agricultural cooperation is a great change in rural production relations, and the movement came extremely quickly and violently. In a very short period of time from the summer and autumn of the year before last, a great upsurge of more than 500 million farmers turning to cooperation was successively set off, and at the same time, it was accompanied by a new agricultural production upsurge. Due to the brilliant foresight of the CPC Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, preparations were made in a timely manner in terms of principles and policies, ideology, and organization, and a struggle against right-leaning conservative ideas was carried out, and it was also pointed out that it is necessary to prevent other deviations that may occur. However, since the movement is a mass movement of hundreds of millions of people and the changes are extremely rapid, and the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives have just been born in the upsurge, the experience of cadres and the masses is generally insufficient, so it is inevitable to make some mistakes in victory.

It should also be pointed out that some shortcomings and errors are caused by certain subjective tendencies of the leadership. For example, some cooperatives are run too large, farmland water conservancy and other plans are too large, or in the improvement of production technology, they violate adapting to local conditions and subjectively force unification. In addition, the phenomenon of cadres forcing orders is also present in some places, even quite serious. In order to learn lessons, improve leadership, improve cadres, and do a good job, it is completely necessary to seriously check all the shortcomings and errors in our subjective guidance. However, we should see that no matter what the subjective and objective reasons for the generation of all the above-mentioned shortcomings and errors, it is generated in the victory, advancement and development. If we want to compare these shortcomings and errors with the great achievements of cooperation, obviously, the former is secondary, and the latter is the main. We must seek truth from facts, grasp the essence of the movement, first affirm the achievements, and at the same time properly criticize the shortcomings, so as to comprehensively obtain experience, encourage confidence, improve work, consolidate victories, and move forward smoothly.

	Further consolidate agricultural cooperatives and strive for a bumper harvest this year

Secondly, I want to talk about how to further consolidate agricultural cooperatives and strive for a bumper harvest this year.

Further consolidating cooperatives and developing agricultural production are the central tasks of the countryside in the future. Regarding the issue of consolidating cooperatives, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have successively issued instructions since April last year. The joint instructions on running cooperatives diligently and thriftily on April 3, 1956, the instructions on strengthening the production leadership and organizational construction of agricultural production cooperatives on September 12, and the instructions on several specific issues in the autumn harvest distribution of agricultural production cooperatives on November 24 have been published in the People's Daily. We believe that resolutely implementing the above-mentioned instructions in accordance with the specific conditions of various places will undoubtedly enable agricultural cooperatives to achieve further consolidation and agricultural production to achieve further development. Recently, Comrade Deng Zihui made a more comprehensive report on consolidating cooperatives and developing agricultural production at the National Model Workers Representative Conference. Therefore, I only want to make some simple explanations here.

	Implement the successive instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and further consolidate agricultural cooperatives

After we have realized full cooperation, consolidating cooperatives is of extreme importance for the smooth development of agricultural production. At the same time, the key to further consolidating cooperatives lies in developing production with all our strength. We believe that the problems that must be firmly grasped and resolved in consolidating cooperatives at present are: how to correctly grasp the production and management guidelines, how to unify the national plan with the certain independence of the cooperative, how to make the level of operation and management adapt to the large-scale collective production, the combination of strengthening leadership and promoting the democracy of members, how to correctly unify the collective interests of the cooperative and the personal interests of the members, how to implement mutual benefit and unity between members and members, poor peasants and middle peasants, and how to correctly handle the relationship between ethnic groups in multi-ethnic areas. Finally, it is necessary to strengthen the ideological leadership of the cooperative. These are all new problems generated under the new socialist production relations. Of course, these problems cannot be completely solved all at once, but they must be solved one by one gradually according to the different conditions in various places, grasping the center. Only by properly and reasonably solving these problems can cooperation be truly consolidated and agricultural production can be developed smoothly. The above-mentioned problems have been basically clarified in the successive instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council mentioned earlier. We hope that the party and government leadership organs in various places will continue to implement these instructions under the principle of adapting to local conditions.

	Carry out in-depth ideological mobilization, seize the spring plowing, improve the operational management level of cooperatives, rationally allocate the production labor time of the cooperative and the members' families, strengthen support and specific guidance for agricultural cooperatives, and strive for a bumper harvest this year

Now let's talk about how to achieve a bumper harvest this year.

This year is the last year of my country's First Five-Year Plan, and it is also the second year of implementing the Draft National Agricultural Development Program after the basic agricultural cooperation nationwide. Therefore, this year is a year of particular significance. The main task in the countryside at present is to realize the call of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and Comrade Mao Zedong on the basis of further consolidating agricultural production cooperatives: "Do everything possible to strive for a bumper harvest this year."

Regarding how to achieve this task, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council will soon have instructions. I would now like to provide a few opinions based on what I feel:

First, we must continue to carry out in-depth ideological mobilization to strive for a bumper harvest this year. We must ensure that all members of agricultural cooperatives can fully understand the important significance of striving for a bumper harvest this year, and further improve their production enthusiasm. At the same time, we should pay attention to overcoming some negative emotions that have occurred in some places due to inappropriate criticism. To this end, we must correctly estimate and explain to everyone the favorable conditions for striving for a bumper harvest this year, and make full use of all favorable conditions. At the same time, we must also appropriately explain some of the existing difficulties and mobilize everyone to do everything possible to overcome the difficulties. We should regard doing a good job in this ideological mobilization as an important aspect of ensuring the smooth development of current agricultural production.

Second, the spring plowing season has arrived or is about to arrive. The north should continue to intensify the work of preparing for farming, and the south should promptly start spring plowing. In order to ensure the realization of a bumper harvest, we must pay special attention to striving to complete this year's farmland water conservancy plan and vigorously accumulating fertilizer and making fertilizer. These are the two most basic measures to achieve increased production. On the basis of doing a good job in the above two tasks, we must actively and steadily improve the farming system and improve production technology according to the principle of adapting to local conditions and practical possibilities.

Third, we must improve the operational management level of cooperatives, resolutely implement the policy of running cooperatives democratically and thriftily. In terms of production and management guidelines, we must continue to implement what Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in the political report of the Eighth National Congress of the CPC: giving priority to the development of grain, while also appropriately developing cotton and other economic crops, developing animal husbandry and other sidelines, and implementing diversified operations in agriculture. In terms of operational management, we should pay special attention to doing a good job in planning management and labor management. The production plan must first meet the requirements of the national plan, and at the same time, it should adapt to local conditions and maintain a certain degree of independence in the production and management of the cooperative. When determining production increase targets, we must be both active and pay attention to being fully reliable. Labor management must be given special attention this year to effectively and rationally improve labor productivity. Only in this way can we smoothly and truly achieve increased production. Of course, to improve labor productivity, this does not mean that it is permissible to unreasonably extend working hours or increase labor intensity. On the contrary, it is necessary to pay attention to improving labor organization, avoiding labor waste, improving production technology, and strengthening labor management on the premise of paying attention to labor protection. In addition, financial management should also be strengthened, we must strictly pay attention to saving, avoid any waste, and implement running cooperatives diligently and thriftily. The key to achieving the above goals is that the cooperative must strengthen leadership and fully promote democracy, improve the representative conference system, and seriously implement the policy of relying on the democracy of members to run the cooperative.

Fourth, we should pay attention to rationally allocating the production labor time of the cooperative and the members' families. On the premise of first ensuring collective production, we must make the two appropriately unified. In terms of income distribution, we must pay attention to ensuring that production needs and the daily life needs of members are taken into account. Special attention should be paid to supporting the family sideline production of members with more difficult lives and members who reduced their income last year. In addition, some problems still exist in the implementation of mutually beneficial policies in some cooperatives, including matters that have not been resolved in the final distribution and settlement at the end of the year, which should be dealt with in a timely and appropriate manner. This is also necessary to encourage members' production enthusiasm and strengthen unity within the cooperative.

Fifth, the continued strengthening of support for agricultural cooperatives by relevant national economic departments is a necessary condition for developing agriculture and sideline production. We require that this year's agricultural loan issuance, supply of means of production and daily necessities, and the purchase of agricultural and sideline products should be done better than last year according to plan. The country's price policy should also continue to be better implemented. In terms of supply and purchase, we should pay more attention to giving farmers the convenience they deserve. The work of material transportation should also be strengthened as much as possible. We must vigorously support the production self-rescue work in disaster areas, and we must ensure that the people in the disaster areas can solve their living difficulties and restore and improve production.

Sixth, we must pay attention to strengthening specific guidance for cooperatives. Most cooperatives have only been running for a year, and the cadres lack experience, new problems are constantly emerging, and there are still many difficulties in the work. Therefore, the CPC Central Committee pointed out that this year and in the next few years, the leaders in various places should attach importance to planned in-depth surveys in the countryside, and help cooperative cadres to carry out their work in a specific way for a long period of time. We believe that implementing this instruction is a major link in guiding the current rural work.

The task of striving for a bumper harvest this year is arduous, but it is also entirely possible. Because although there are still some difficulties in agricultural production this year, there are more favorable conditions than last year. The main ones are that the vast majority of cooperatives have one year of production experience last year, more production preparations were made last winter and this spring, the vast number of members have obtained preliminary habits of collective production, and they have an increasing enthusiasm for production. As long as we resolutely implement the relevant instructions of the CPC Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the State Council in accordance with the specific conditions of various places, and everyone works hard, we will be able to victoriously complete the task.

	On the Issue of Village Cadres

Finally, I would like to talk about the issue of village cadres.

To realize the socialist construction of the countryside, ensure the consolidation of cooperatives, and smoothly develop agricultural production, we not only need the guidance of correct principles and policies, but we must also have a rural cadre team that is good at relying on the masses, organizing and mobilizing the masses. Everyone knows that we already have and have long had such a team. Relying on this team, we not only persisted in the long-term revolutionary war in the countryside in the past, but also relied on them to complete various social reform movements in the countryside after the national liberation, until we completed the current agricultural cooperation. In the future, we will also rely on them to carry out the long-term socialist construction of the countryside. This team now includes 700,000 cadres who are detached from production, and millions of cadres who are semi-detached and not detached from production. They have all been generated successively from the long-term revolutionary struggle in the countryside, and have undergone varying degrees of struggle tests. The vast majority of them are from poor and hired peasants, and some are from middle peasants or other classes. Their advantages are: they generally have the excellent qualities of the working people, a higher degree of class consciousness, and they are an excellent part of the vast masses. The vast majority of them also work hard and are supported by the masses. However, they often have more or less shortcomings and errors in their work. On the one hand, this is because their thinking and style still have varying degrees of problems of small producers, their cultural level is not high, and their political level is not easy to keep up with the constantly changing requirements of the new working environment; on the other hand, it is also because the leadership has not done enough systematic and sufficient work to improve them. There are also some subjective and bureaucratic tendencies in their work guidance from time to time. For example, some of the shortcomings and errors in rural work last year were directly related to the above situations. In addition, in recent years, some serious phenomena of illegal and disorderly discipline have occurred in individual places in the countryside, which shows that although the vast majority of our rural cadres are good and pure, there are indeed some cadres with poor work styles and a very small number of people with bad qualities, even individual bad elements and reactionaries. At the same time, relatively serious errors have occurred in the work of individual places. Caused dissatisfaction among the masses there. All of these must be seriously noted.

	Care for and encourage the enthusiasm and creativity of rural cadres, and help them correct their shortcomings in a timely manner; those who have repeatedly made serious mistakes and have not sincerely repented after education should be given necessary punishment; bad elements and criminals should be dealt with seriously

Regarding rural cadres, we should first see their advantages and affirm their achievements in work, which is the main aspect. At the same time, we must also see their weaknesses and point out their shortcomings in work. We must care for and encourage the political enthusiasm and creativity of rural cadres, and constantly improve them politically and ideologically; at the same time, we must also promptly discover their shortcomings and errors in work, and give them appropriate criticism and education to help them correct their shortcomings and errors, the purpose of which is also to better improve and unite them. Those who have repeatedly made serious mistakes and cannot truly repent after education should be given necessary punishment, and used to educate the majority. Those who are extremely bad and bad elements must be dealt with seriously. Criminals, no matter who they are, should be dealt with according to the specific circumstances and according to law. In this respect, any accommodation or indulgence is wrong.

Everyone knows a situation that since last summer, party organizations at all levels of the CPC have been to the countryside almost universally, and after opposing the tendency of conservative thinking, they have launched a struggle against the tendency of subjectivism. This struggle has achieved great success and has proved to be completely necessary. The leadership style of party organizations in various places has also been improved as a result. However, in the process of opposing subjectivism, there have also been exaggerations of the shortcomings and errors in the work of cooperatives, neglecting or even denying the great achievements and superiority of cooperation, and in some places it has developed to the point of only examining the shortcomings and errors in the work, not talking about the achievements in the work, and even opposing talking about achievements. The situation in Lipu County, Guangxi, which I learned about last winter, was like this. Wherever the above deviations have occurred, rural cadres cannot hold their heads high, and the leadership of rural work is timid and at a loss. The emotions of some cooperative members have also been frustrated. The fact that the work of preparing for farming was not strong enough in some places from last winter to this spring is closely related to this. We should not ignore such an important lesson.

Rural work is now completely in a new environment and new conditions, the work tasks are very heavy, and many production tasks have strict timeliness. Since our current agricultural production is basically concentrated in cooperatives, the vast number of farmers are often particularly concerned about the leadership of the cooperatives. They demand both the promotion of democracy and the strengthening of leadership, and demand that cooperatives be run effectively. Because the success or failure of a cooperative basically depends on the quality of the leadership, we hope that the leaders in various places will teach rural cadres to be good at studying the new situations after cooperation, learning new methods of leading collective production, so that their work can adapt to the needs of the current new conditions. At the same time, in order to truly rely on the masses to run cooperatives well and do a good job in production in a timely manner, on the one hand, we must continue to correct and prevent the working methods of forced orders, and at the same time, we must overcome the tendency of being timid and letting things drift, and encourage them to boldly and cautiously shoulder the responsibility of leading the cooperative. We believe that the vast number of rural cadres will work harder and more vigorously than last year, relying on the vast number of farmers, and together with them, to launch a new production upsurge in order to "do everything possible to strive for a bumper harvest this year."

专栏：

    关于农业合作化和农业生产问题
    陈正人的发言
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的报告。完全同意陈叔通副主席的关于本会常务委员会的工作报告，陈云副总理关于增产节约和李富春副总理关于第二个五年计划的说明。我现就有关农业合作化和农业生产问题，提供一些情况和意见：
    巨大的成就，前进中的缺点
    首先谈一谈关于农业合作化的发展情况和去年的农业生产问题。
    农业合作化已基本完成；去年在重大灾情下，农作物大部增产；十七个县市的粮食产量达到农业发展纲要草案规定的十二年指标
    去年我国农村是农业社会主义改造高潮和生产高潮汹涌澎湃的一年。也是开始实施全国农业发展纲要草案的第一年。我们已在去年基本上完成了农业合作化（除部分少数民族地区外）。到目前为止，全国加入高级社的农户已经达到占总农户的90％以上，共建成了七十四万六千一百个农业生产合作社（每社平均一百九十户）。从此，我国农民摆脱了个体经济的束缚，挖掉了穷根，走上了保证共同富裕的社会主义大道。正如毛泽东同志所指出的，“这是五亿多农村人口的大规模的社会主义的革命运动，带有极其伟大的世界意义”的胜利。
    去年的农业生产，也获得了新的重大胜利。虽然去年遭遇了严重的水灾、风灾和数十年来未有的旱灾，灾情大于1954年，但是各种农作物的绝大多数都实现了增产。我们来看看去年各种主要农作物的产量和1955年丰收年的比较：粮食是三千六百八十六亿斤，增加了近二百亿斤，即增产5.4％（比1954年则增加了近五百亿斤）。大豆是二百零五亿斤，增产12.8％。棉花是三千零五十万担，略有减少，但除灾区外，其他地区一般是丰收的。花生是六千八百七十八万担，增产17.5％。苎麻一百零九万担，增产11.9％。烤烟八百六十二万担，增产44.8％。油菜籽一千九百六十九万担，稍有增产。甘蔗一万八千零九十四万担，增产11.6％。甜菜略有增产。只有芝麻、亚麻减了些产。上述数字，说明了我们去年农业生产的成绩是很大的。
    还要指出一个重要的事实。根据现有材料，全国已经有十七个县市的粮食产量，在去年分别达到了全国农业发展纲要草案所规定的十二年指标。这十七个县市就是福建省龙溪、海澄、长乐三县，广东省的潮安、普宁、揭阳、潮阳、南澳、澄海六县，湖北的孝感、黄陂两县，这些县都达到平均亩产八百斤以上，其中九个县平均亩产一千斤以上。山东省的黄县，河北省的正定县达到平均亩产五百斤。河北省的藁城县，陕西省的长安县、咸阳市，河南省的孟县达到平均亩产四百斤。这是一个值得十分重视的事实。这个事实充分证明在中共中央和毛泽东同志领导下制定的全国农业发展纲要草案的正确性，也充分表明由于合作化的胜利，为提高农业生产、保证工农业相互适应的发展，创造了可能。
    农业生产战线上发生了许多重大变化，保证了农业显著增产；绝大多数农业社都是办得好的
    为什么我们在全面农业合作化后的第一年，又在遭遇了重大灾害的情况下，能够获得如此显著的增产成绩呢？去年在农业生产战线上，究竟发生了什么样的重大变化呢？
    第一，由于合作化的胜利，农民的劳动生产热忱，是大为提高了。新的农业生产高潮伴随着合作化高潮同时到来的这个特点，就是充分的证明。十二年全国农业发展纲要草案的及时提出，更进一步鼓舞了农民的生产积极性。我们到处都可以看到凡是合作化了的农村，参加劳动生产的人是空前的增多了，一般的农村平均增加到20％左右。劳动力的出勤率普遍提高了，一般提高到20％左右。劳动效率也在逐渐提高并且还在不断提高着。由于统一使用劳动力，实行分工分业，也就有可能真正做到人尽其才，才尽其用。劳动力的增多和劳动生产率的提高，这是一个新的极重大的变化，这就是合作社有可能比个体农民增产较快较多的基础，也就是合作化制度优越性的可靠基础。
    第二，由于合作化，生产资料和生产资金特别是土地和劳力得以集中统一的有计划的合理利用，为较大规模和较快的发展农业基本建设，创造了可能。如去年一年兴修农田水利工程的灌溉面积达到一亿五千万亩（当年受益的达一万万亩）。这等于解放前我国历史上有水利设施的灌溉面积的一半，等于解放后六年来发展的灌溉面积的200％，也等于超过第一个五年计划任务指标的一倍。去年完成的水土保持的控制面积达六万六千三百平方公里，等于解放后六年来完成的控制面积的总和。新开垦荒地三千多万亩，等于第一个五年计划任务指标的80％。造林面积达四百万公顷左右，也是前所未有的。上述这些数字，表明去年的农业基本建设成就，是空前巨大的。缺点是有5％左右的农田水利工程质量很差，出现了一些“废品”。对水土保持面的治理不够，农、林、水还缺乏必要的协作。造林的成活率保存率有些地方也很差，造成了一些劳力的浪费。所有这些，都是和领导上计划要求过高，技术指导赶不上等原因有关的。我们应该注意要避免这些缺点。
    第三，由于合作化，也为较大规模的改进耕作制度，改良生产技术，发展精耕细作，改良土壤，提高土地肥力，创造了新的有利条件。去年由旱地改作水稻田的面积达一千四百三十万亩。如东北几个省一年改成的水田，等于历史上全部水田的总和。复种指数比1955年增加了4.4％，即等于增加了九千九百六十多万亩的播种面积，为解放以来增加最多的一年。良种推广，仅粮食一项比1955年增加二万四千万亩，等于全国现有良
  种面积的三分之一。棉花的主要产区，已做到全部使用良种。适当密植和灭虫等技术比过去也是大面积的推广了。在积肥造肥方面也超过过去任何一年。如河北省积肥达八十四亿多担，比往年增加三倍多。广东积肥达四十二亿多担，比1955年增加三倍多。其他绝大多数省份均较往年增加一倍到二倍。根据现有的材料，去年所采取的上述各项技术措施，仅就旱地改水田，增加双季稻，低产作物改高产作物等项结果计算，即增产粮食一百二十亿斤。由此可以看出上述这些增产措施的成绩是很大的、是主要的。但也不是没有缺点的。根据各地调查，在推广技术改良方面，有80％是成功的，15％是多少出了毛病的，有5％是搞错了的。个别地方甚至造成了严重的损失。所有这些也主要是由于干部缺乏领导大规模的合作生产的经验，或者领导上要求过急，违反因地制宜所造成的。这种教训，是应该重视的。
    第四，由于合作化所具有的上述优越条件，去年合作社所表现的抗灾能力，也是巨大的，是个体经济不能比拟的。去年遭受严重旱灾的省份有湖南、广西，其次是江西。遭受严重水灾、风灾的省份有河北、江苏、安徽、河南、浙江、吉林、黑龙江等省。合计全国受灾的农田面积达二万二千多万亩。其中除有八千万亩因系毁灭性的灾害失收外，其余都因为合作社展开了抗灾斗争，大大的减轻了灾害，避免了更多的减产。如广西省大部地区自去年8月初到今年1月初，一直苦旱，受灾面积达一千万亩以上（全省三千多万亩耕地），但去年粮食产量比1955年只减产了三几亿斤。其他受灾严重的省份，除个别省外，情形也大致一样。应该说像去年这样的重灾年，粮食产量比前年丰收年增产了5.4％，经济作物的绝大多数都程度不同的增了产，这决不能说是偶然的现象。
    以上就是一年来在农业生产战线上发生的新变化。也就是去年为什么在灾害严重的情况下，能够实现农业显著增产的根本原因。可以看出，上述这些新的重大变化，是在合作化胜利的基础上产生的，离开合作化的胜利，是不可想像的。这就无可怀疑的充分地证明了农业合作化的巨大优越性。
    去年农业生产合作社一年来生产和分配总结的事实也告诉我们，全国绝大多数的合作社是办得好的，办得差的约占5％左右。凡是非灾区或灾害不大的地区，约有80％左右的合作社都程度不同的增了产，75％的社员都程度不同的增加了收入。例如河南省根据一百一十四个社的调查（其中包括粮食产区四十二个社，经济作物区二十三个社，山区十九个社，城市郊区五个社，灾区二十五个社），其中增产社七十八个，占68.4％，减产社三十六个占31.6％，这是把非灾区和灾区总合计算的。如果单就非灾区的八十九个社计算，增产社七十三个，则增产社占82％。这些社比1955年平均增产10.84％，如果除去灾区社，则平均增产17.77％。从社员收入情况看，这一百一十四个社保证90％以上社员增加收入的十一个社，保证80％—90％的社员增加收入的二十二个社，保证60％—80％社员增加收入的三十六个社，60％以下社员增加收入的四十五个社。就是灾区虽然由于严重的自然灾害减了产或者失收，但是经过合作社组织生产自救，加上政府的援助，社员生活仍然是得到了保证的。我去年底在广西的桂西僮族自治州和桂林专区曾调查了带有代表性的几个合作社，那里的情况，和河南也大致一样。如果说遭受了严重灾害的河南、广西的基本情况是好的，那么去年丰收的省份就要好得多。例如湖北根据三万多个高级社和三万多个初级社的调查，增产了的社前者是92％，后者是86％。增加收入的社员全省一般的社平均是84％，保收户8％，减收户只有7％。这些地区的农民生活在合作化的第一年，就获得了进一步的改善。这些事实充分证明：去年绝大多数合作社办得好的估计是正确的。正因为这样，所以参加合作社的广大农民，是拥护合作社的，特别是入社前的贫农和下中农就表现得更为坚决。只有很小一部分原来的富裕农民，因为收入暂时减少等原因，存在着一些不满情绪，我们相信，这种情况，经过一定时候，随着合作社生产的提高，是会逐渐改变的。这些就是去年农业合作社发展的基本情况。
    去年农业生产的胜利，农业合作化一年来发展的基本情况，使我们有充分根据也有充分信心的说，我们的合作化，是获得了伟大成功的。虽然这种成功在大多数地区还刚刚开始不久，尚待我们较长期的（要有三、五年时间）努力去巩固。但是这些成功，也再一次地完全证明了中共中央和毛泽东同志所规定的农业合作化的方针、政策的完全正确，同时也表明我们各级领导机关，特别是广大农村干部是作了辛勤而艰巨的努力的。
    肯定成绩，恰当地批判缺点，巩固胜利，继续前进
    农业合作化和去年的农业生产活动也是有缺点和错误的。不论在合作社的经营管理上、生产指导上、互利政策贯彻执行上和内部相互关系的处理上等方面，都产生了一些缺点和错误。除前面指出的外，比如去年有很多合作社增产计划指标偏高；一个短期忽视了副业生产；当前生产与基本建设缺乏合理平衡，就是对于长远利益与眼前利益安排不够恰当；生产需要与社员日常生活需要照顾不够全面，也就是对集体利益与社员个人利益处理不够合理；在生产技术改进上，部分地方因地制宜不够，招致了一些损失；牲畜管理，部分地方也很差，引起了一些不正常的死亡。一句话就是经营管理不善和民主办社勤俭办社的方针贯彻执行还不够。还由于种种原因，如某些社员减少了收入（全国一般地区，大约5％—10％左右），或者由于互利政策执行较差以及其他等项原因，去冬曾在个别地方发生过某些社员闹退社的现象。所有这些缺点和错误，已经引起重视，从去年夏天起就已逐渐发现和改正，并且还在不断改正中。
    为什么会产生这些缺点和错误呢？大家都知道：农业合作化是农村生产关系的大变革，运动又是来的极为迅速猛烈的。只是在前年夏秋起的一个很短的时间内，就先后掀起了五亿多农民转向合作化的大高潮，而且同时还伴随着新的农业生产大高潮。这种形势的到来，由于中共中央和毛泽东同志的英明预见，曾及时作了方针政策上、思想上、组织上的准备，进行了反右倾保守思想的斗争，也指出了必须预防可能发生的其他偏向。可是，运动既然是几万万人的又是变化极为迅速的群众运动，同时，农业合作社的极大多数，也是在高潮中刚刚诞生，干部和群众的经验一般是不足的，因此，就难免在胜利中犯一些错误。
    也应该指出：有些缺点错误，是由于领导上的某些主观主义偏向造成的。比如有些合作社办的过大，农田水利等计划过大，或者在生产技术改良上违反因地制宜，主观强求统一等。此外，干部强迫命令的现象，部分地方也是存在的，甚至相当严重。为了吸取教训，改善领导，提高干部，做好工作，认真检查我们主观指导上的一切缺点和错误，是完全必要的。但是我们应该看到：所有上述这些缺点错误不管产生的主客观原因如何，它是在胜利前进发展中产生的。如果要把这些缺点、错误和合作化所获得的巨大成绩加以比较，显然，前者是次要的，后者才是主要的。我们必须实事求是，把握运动的本质，首先肯定成绩，同时又恰当批判缺点，这样才能全面取得经验，鼓舞信心，改进工作，巩固胜利，顺利前进。
    进一步巩固农业社，
    争取今年大丰收
    其次，要说一说如何进一步巩固农业合作社，争取今年农业大丰收的问题。
    进一步巩固合作社，发展农业生产，这是农村今后的中心任务。关于巩固合作社的问题，中共中央和国务院从去年4月起曾经连续发出指示，已经在人民日报上公布的有1956年4月3日的关于勤俭办社的联合指示，9月12日的关于加强农业生产合作社的生产领导和组织建设的指示，11月24日的关于农业生产合作社秋收分配中若干具体问题的指示。我们认为按照各地具体情况坚决贯彻执行上述这些指示，无疑地会使农业合作社获得进一步的巩固，农业生产获得进一步的发展。最近邓子恢同志在全国劳动模范代表会议上，对于巩固合作社和发展农业生产，又作了较全面的报告。因此，我在这里，只想作一些简单的说明。
    贯彻执行中共中央和国务院历次指示，进一步巩固农业合作社
    在我们实现了全面合作化以后，巩固合作社，对于顺利发展农业生产，就具有极为重要的意义。同时实现进一步巩固合作社的关键，又在于要全力发展生产。目前在巩固合作社方面必须切实抓紧解决的问题，我们认为有这样一些问题，这就是：生产经营方针如何正确掌握的问题，国家计划与合作社一定的独立性如何统一的问题，经营管理水平如何做到与集体的大生产相适应的问题，加强领导与发扬社员民主的结合问题，合作社集体利益与社员个人利益如何正确统一的问题，社员与社员、贫农与中农之间如何贯彻互利团结问题，多民族地区民族与民族间的关系正确处理问题。最后就是要加强合作社思想领导的问题。这些都是在新的社会主义的生产关系下产生的新问题。这些问题，当然不是一下子可以完全解决的，但是，必须按照各地不同情况，抓紧中心，一个一个地逐步加以解决。只有恰当的合理地解决了这些问题，才能使合作化得到真正的巩固，农业生产得到顺利的发展。上述这些问题，在前面指出的中共中央和国务院的历次指示中曾经先后作了基本的阐明。我们希望各地党政领导机关要在因地制宜的原则下，继续贯彻执行这些指示。
    深入进行思想动员，抓紧春耕，提高合作社经营管理水平，合理支配社与社员家庭生产劳动时间，加强对农业社的支援和具体指导，争取今年大丰收
    现在来谈一下如何实现争取今年农业大丰收的问题。
    今年是我国第一个五年计划的最后一年，也是全国农业基本合作化后，实施全国农业发展纲要草案的第二年。因此，今年这一年，是具有特别重大意义的一年。当前农村的主要任务，就是要在进一步巩固农业生产合作社的基础上，实现中共中央、国务院和毛泽东同志的号召：“想尽一切办法，千方百计，争取今年农业大丰收”。
    关于如何争取实现这个任务，中共中央和国务院不久将有指示。我现就个人所感觉到的，提供几点意见：
    第一，必须继续深入展开争取今年大丰收的思想动员。要做到使所有农业合作社的社员都能够充分了解争取今年大丰收的重要意义，达到进一步提高他们的生产积极性。同时，要注意克服部分地方因批评不当，曾经发生过的某些消极情绪。为此，必须正确估计和向大家说明今年争取大丰收的有利条件，要做到充分利用一切有利条件。同时，也要适当的说明现时存在的某些困难，发动大家千方百计努力克服困难。我们应把做好这种思想动员工作，看成是保证顺利展开当前农业生产的重要方面。
    第二，春耕季节已经或即将到来。北方应继续加紧备耕工作，南方应及时展开春耕。为着保证大丰收的实现，要特别注意争取完成今年的农田水利计划，大力积肥、造肥，这是达到增产的两项最基本的措施。在做好上述两项工作的基础上，要根据因地制宜的原则和实际可能，积极而稳步地改进耕作制度和改良生产技术。
    第三，要提高合作社的经营管理水平，坚决贯彻执行民主办社，勤俭办社的方针，在生产经营的方针上，必须继续贯彻执行刘少奇同志在中共八大政治报告中所指出的：优先发展粮食，同时又必须适当地发展棉花及其他经济作物，发展畜牧业及其他副业，实行农业的多种经营的方针。在经营管理上，应该特别重视搞好计划管理和劳动管理两个方面。生产计划既要首先满足国家计划的要求，同时也应因地制宜，保持合作社生产经营上的一定独立性。确定增产指标时，既要积极，又必须注意充分可靠。劳动管理，今年要特别重视，有效地合理地提高劳动生产率。只有这样，才能顺利地真正实现增产。当然，要提高劳动生产率，这决不是说，就可以允许不合理的延长劳动时间或增加劳动强度。相反，而是要在注意劳动保护的前提下，重视改善劳动组织，避免劳力浪费，提高生产技术，加强劳动管理。此外，财务管理也应加强，要严格重视节约，避免任何浪费，实行勤俭办社。达成上述目的的关键，合作社既要加强领导，又必须充分发扬民主，健全代表大会制度，做到认真贯彻执行依靠社员民主办社的方针。
    第四，要注意合理支配好合作社的和社员家庭的生产劳动时间。在首先保证集体生产的原则下，要做到使两者适当统一。在收入分配上必须注意使生产需要和社员日常生活需要得到兼顾。特别要注意扶助生活较困难的社员和去年减少收入的社员的家庭副业生产。此外，一部分合作社在互利政策执行上，还存在着的某些问题，包括年终分配决算未了事项，都应及时适当处理，这也是鼓励社员的生产积极性，加强社内团结所必须注意的。
    第五，国家各有关经济部门，继续加强对农业合作社的支援，是发展农业、副业生产的一个必要条件。我们要求今年的农贷发放和生产资料及日用品的供应工作和农、副业产品的收购工作，要按计划比去年做的更好。国家的价格政策也要继续更好的贯彻。在供应和收购工作方面，要更注意给农民以应有的便利。物资运转工作也要尽力加强。对于灾区生产自救工作，更要大力扶助，务必做到既能保证灾区人民解决生活困难，又能恢复并提高生产。
    第六，要重视加强对合作社的具体指导。大多数合作社刚办一年，干部经验不足，新的问题不断产生，工作困难也还不少。因此，中共中央指出：今年以至最近几年，各地领导应重视有计划地深入乡村，进行调查研究，较长期地具体帮助合作社干部进行工作。我们认为贯彻执行这个指示，是指导当前农村工作上的一个主要环节。
    争取今年大丰收的任务，是艰巨的，也是完全可能的。因为今年农业生产，虽然还有一些困难，但是，比之去年有了更多的有利条件。主要的是绝大数的合作社有了去年一年的生产经验，去冬今春做了更多的生产准备工作，广大社员获得了初步的集体生产的习惯，他们具有日益高涨的生产积极性等。只要我们按照各地具体情况，坚决执行中共中央、毛主席和国务院的有关指示，大家努力，我们是能够胜利地完成任务的。
    关于乡村干部问题
    最后想谈一下乡村干部问题。
    要实现农村的社会主义建设，保证合作社的巩固，顺利发展农业生产，我们不仅需要有正确的方针政策的指导，还必须要有一支能够善于依靠群众、组织和动员群众的农村干部队伍。大家都知道：我们已经而且早已有了这样一支队伍。我们依靠这支队伍，在农村不仅坚持了过去的长期革命战争，而且还依靠他们完成了全国解放后农村的各项社会改革运动，直到完成了现在的农业合作化。今后我们也还要依靠他们来进行农村的社会主义的长期建设。这支队伍现在包括了脱离生产的干部七十万人，半脱离和不脱离生产的干部几百万人。他们都是从农村长期的革命斗争中，先后产生出来的，是经过了不同程度的斗争考验的。他们的极大多数都是出身于贫雇农，一部分出身于中农或其他阶层。他们的优点是：一般的具有劳动人民的优良品质，较高的阶级觉悟，他们是广大群众中的一个优秀部分。他们的极大多数也是努力工作的，为群众所拥护的。但是他们在工作中也往往有或多或少的缺点和错误。这一方面是由于他们的思想作风上还存在着小生产者的不同程度的毛病，文化水平不高，政治水平不容易完全跟上新的工作环境不断变化的要求；一方面也由于领导上对他们的提高工作做得不够系统，不够充分。对他们工作指导，也有时存在某些主观主义和官僚主义的偏向。比如去年在农村工作上的某些缺点错误，其原因之一，就是和上面的这些情况直接相联系的。此外，近年来农村个别地方曾先后发生过某些违法乱纪的严重现象，这说明我们的农村干部虽然绝大多数是好的，是纯洁的，但也确实存在着一些作风不好和极少数的品质不良的分子，甚至个别的坏分子和反动分子。同时也有个别地方的工作发生过较严重的错误。引起了那里群众的不满。这些都是必须严肃注意的。
    爱护和鼓励农村干部的积极性、创造性，及时帮助他们改正缺点；对于屡犯严重错误经过教育不认真改悔的人，应给予必要处分；坏分子、犯罪分子应严肃处理
    我们对于农村干部，应该首先要看到他们的优点，肯定其工作成绩方面，这是主要方面。同时也要看到他们的弱点，指出其工作缺点方面。我们要爱护和鼓励农村干部的政治积极性、创造性，从政治上、思想上不断提高他们；同时也要及时发现他们工作中的缺点错误，给予他们以恰当的批评教育，帮助他们改正缺点错误，目的也是为了更好的提高和团结他们。对于屡犯严重错误经过教育不能真正改悔的人，应该给予必要的处分，并借以教育多数。对于某些品质极端恶劣的分子和坏分子，就更必须进行严肃的处理。对于犯罪分子，不管他是什么人，都应按照具体情节，依法处理。在这一方面，如果存在任何迁就、姑息，都是错误的。
    有一种情况大家是知道的，从去年夏季以来，中共各级党组织一直到农村，几乎普遍的在反对了保守思想偏向之后，又开展了反主观主义偏向的斗争。这个斗争，收到了很大成效，证明是完全必要的。各地党组织领导作风也因此都有提高。但是在反对主观主义的过程中，也发生过夸大合作社工作的缺点和错误，忽视甚至否定合作化的伟大成绩和优越性，有些地方竟发展到只检讨工作的缺点、错误，不谈工作成绩，甚至反对谈成绩。我去年冬天到广西所了解的荔浦县的情况，就是这样。凡是发生了上述偏差的地方，农村干部抬不起头来，对农村工作的领导，缩手缩脚，不知所措。一部分合作社员的情绪，也遭到挫折。去冬以至今春某些地方，曾经对备耕工作劲头不足，与此关系甚大。这样一个重要教训，我们是不应该忽视的。
    农村工作现在完全处在一种新的环境和新的条件下，工作任务非常繁重，许多生产任务又都是具有严格的时间性。由于我们现时的农业生产基本上都集中在合作社，因而广大农民，就经常特别关心着合作社的领导。他们既要求发扬民主，又要求加强领导，要求有效地办好合作社。因为合作社办的好或坏，基本上决定于领导的好或坏，因此我们希望各地领导上要教导农村干部，善于钻研合作化后的新情况，学习领导集体生产的新方法，使自己的工作，能够适应当前新条件下的需要。同时，为了切实做到依靠群众办好合作社，及时搞好生产，一方面要继续纠正和防止强迫命令的工作方法，同时又必须克服束手束脚放任自流的偏向，鼓励他们大胆而谨慎地把领导合作社的责任，勇敢的担当起来。我们相信广大的农村干部一定会比去年更其焕发的努力，依靠广大农民群众，和他们一道，为着“想尽一切办法，争取今年大丰收”，掀起一个新的生产高潮。
