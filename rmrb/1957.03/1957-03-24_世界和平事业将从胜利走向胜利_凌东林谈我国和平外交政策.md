I. Premier Zhou's Visits to Eleven Asian and European Countries Further Strengthened Solidarity with These Countries

Premier Zhou's visits to eleven countries in Asia and Europe are the most significant event in our country's diplomatic history. During Premier Zhou's visits abroad, we could see and hear, anytime and anywhere, from blackboards, broadcasts, teahouse and tavern conversations, and street talk, how much the broad masses of people at home valued and cared about the news of the delegation. When I was preparing to come to Beijing to attend the conference, many of my brothers, sisters, and friends repeatedly urged me to listen carefully to Premier Zhou's report on his visits to eleven countries in Asia and Europe and convey it to them when I returned.

I was excited and happy to hear Premier Zhou's report on his visits to eleven countries in Asia and Europe.

Premier Zhou's visits abroad lasted about eighty days, covering a distance of about 110,000 miles. He was not only given a warm and grand reception by the governments of the countries he visited, but also received a warm and grand welcome from tens of thousands of people in these countries. This is the most honorable and glorious page in our country's diplomatic history.

Let me pay my highest respects to Comrade Zhou Enlai, the Premier who worked hard for the country and returned full of honor, friendship, peace, and knowledge!

Through these visits, the spirit of our government's opposition to great-power chauvinism and adherence to proletarian internationalism was manifested, expressing the sincere desire of our people to oppose aggression and war, to seek peace, and to "peacefully coexist" with any country in the world. It further achieved mutual understanding and cooperation between our country and these countries; strengthened the solidarity between our country and various nationalist countries; consolidated the solidarity between socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union; and also promoted the unity between socialist countries and nationalist countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which made a very significant contribution to safeguarding world peace.

II. The Chinese People Sincerely Wish to Continue Negotiations with the United States. If the United States Persists in Its Own Way, the Chinese People Will Never Be Afraid

Some say, "The United States is the biggest obstacle to world peace. Without the support of the United States, Chiang Kai-shek would have long ago returned Taiwan to the embrace of the motherland. If we don't 'remove the firewood from under the pot' and strive to improve Sino-US relations, it will be difficult to achieve the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. The government has made a series of efforts to improve Sino-US relations. Although it has not received the response it deserves from the United States, we must continue to work hard. World opinion is always on our side," advocating continued negotiations with the United States.

Some say, "The United States persists in its policy of hostility towards the Chinese people, which is unreasonable. Asking them to sit down and negotiate is like 'playing the lute to a cow'; asking them to lay down their butcher knife is like 'seeking skin from a tiger.' American newspapers recently criticized the government for implementing an ostrich-like foreign policy. I think it can also be said to be implementing a frog-in-a-well foreign policy, because Dulles and his ilk are still 'sitting in the well and looking at the sky.' China has been liberated for more than seven years, and it has made rapid progress without the United States as a friend. The cause of socialist construction has already achieved amazing results. The United States is hostile to 600 million Chinese people who possess abundant resources, minerals, vast land, and a broad market. It is not China that suffers the loss, but the United States itself." Advocating that there is no need to negotiate with the United States anymore.

These two different views seem to be one-sided, but their heartfelt desire to offer their opinions is the same. Their shared desire is the common desire of the Chinese people for peace and progress.

Our country's adherence to a peaceful foreign policy is entirely correct, as it not only conforms to the unanimous wishes of the Chinese people but also conforms to the unanimous demands of all peace-loving people throughout the world. Based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which are in line with the aspirations of the world's people, our country should be willing, sincerely willing, to continue negotiations with the United States. However, if the United States remains obstinate, still attempts to create two Chinas, still attempts to occupy Taiwan forever, and still attempts to carry out subversive activities, then the Chinese people will certainly do everything in their power to give a merciless counterattack. I believe we already have enough strength to shatter all the tricks and conspiracies of US imperialism.

The present era is no longer an era in which imperialism can dominate and be domineering. The so-called "bullfighter" missile will never intimidate the Chinese people. Using "US aid" as bait will never be able to stop the high tide of nationalist independence movements. The Eisenhower Doctrine, which takes anti-communism as an excuse to seize the colonial interests of Britain and France, further promotes the crisis of increasingly acute contradictions among the imperialist countries. "Changing course according to the wind" is the time to do so; persisting in one's own way will be too late for regret! The vast majority of the American people are peace-loving, and the United States is not lacking in far-sighted politicians. The Chinese people are willing to be friends with you, to work together to safeguard world peace and promote the cause of human progress!

III. Further Improve Relations with Japan, the Philippines, and Thailand on the Basis of Solidarity with India and Seven Other Countries

Japan is an industrialized country in Asia. The determined, courageous, hardworking, and enduring Japanese people are worthy of our admiration. Their current situation is similar to ours before liberation and is also worthy of our sympathy. Although our people have suffered a lot from the Japanese militarists in the past, the Chinese people are still very willing to be friends with the Japanese people. I hope the government will make further efforts to promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations!

Pakistan is a member of the Manila Treaty Organization, but it has already established friendly relations with our country. Judging from Premier Zhou's visit to Pakistan, it can be seen that there is a long-standing and deep friendship between the people of China and Pakistan. Therefore, although Thailand and the Philippines are important pillars of the Manila Treaty, the deep friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of Thailand and the Philippines, due to long-standing historical relations, cannot be destroyed by any force. I hope the government will make further efforts to improve Sino-Thai relations and Sino-Philippine relations.

Our government should strive to improve Sino-Japanese relations, Sino-Philippine relations, and Sino-Thai relations. Premier Zhou has already pointed this out in his report. Why do I specifically bring it up again? Premier Zhou visited eight Asian countries: Vietnam, India, Burma, Cambodia, Nepal, Afghanistan, Ceylon, and Pakistan, fully demonstrating the invincible strength of the Asian people's big family solidarity, which is extremely exciting. However, due to the existence of objective obstacles, Premier Zhou was unable to visit the three Asian countries of Japan, the Philippines, and Thailand, which is regrettable. On the basis of our unity with India and seven other Asian countries, further developing our country's unity work with Japan, the Philippines, and Thailand will achieve even greater achievements for the great cause of consolidating Asian peace and safeguarding world peace.

IV. The General Trend of the World is Towards Relaxation and Progress, and the General Trend of China is Towards Prosperity and Strength

The forces of peace and progress throughout the world are growing stronger and more consolidated, and there are signs that US imperialism is being forced to consider abandoning its war policy of creating international tensions. After Premier Zhou analyzed the international situation in detail in his report, he pointed out that the general trend of the world is towards relaxation and progress. As long as the people of the world unite and persist in their struggle, lasting world peace can be achieved, which is entirely correct. This is the most favorable condition for our country to build socialism.

Under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao and the Party, our country's socialist cause is advancing by leaps and bounds. The socialist transformation of the three major sectors has basically been completed, and the first Five-Year Plan for socialist construction has almost been completed a year ahead of schedule. The people of all strata in China have embarked on the broad road of socialism. What a great historical achievement this is! We have also discovered some shortcomings and errors in our work, and we are courageous in exposing them and correcting them. We have also encountered many difficulties in the process of production development, but we must not bow our heads to difficulties and do our best to overcome them. The ironclad facts prove that our country's people's democratic government has a very good foundation in politics, economy, and military affairs. It can be said that it is as stable as a rock and as solid as a golden soup. If anyone dares to attempt to sabotage or carry out subversive activities, they will surely suffer a bloody nose and bring about their own destruction!

I learned a few words from Premier Zhou to conclude my speech: The general trend of our country is towards prosperity and strength. As long as the people of the whole country unite and persist in hard work, our country's socialist construction and the world's cause of peace and progress can be won by us to advance from victory to victory. That's all. I wish everyone good health! (Attached picture)

　　世界和平事业将从胜利走向胜利
　　凌东林谈我国和平外交政策
　  一、周总理访问亚洲和欧洲十一个国家，进一步加强了与这些国家的团结
    周总理访问了欧亚十一个国家，是我国外交史上最有意义的一件大事情。在周总理出国访问期间内，我们随时随地，从黑板报上、从广播声中、从茶楼酒馆街头巷尾的谈话声中，都可以看到听到国内广大群众对于访问团的消息，是如何的重视与关怀。当我准备来京出席大会时，很多的兄弟姊妹朋友们再三叮咛，要我仔细听好周总理出国访问的报告，回去转告他们。
    我很兴奋地愉快地听到了周总理所作的关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一个国的报告。
    周总理出国访问，历时约八十天，历程约十一万里，不仅受到被访问各国政府亲切的隆重的招待，而且受到这些国家成千成万人民热烈的盛大的欢迎，这是我国外交史上最荣誉最光辉的一页。
    让我向为国勤劳、满载荣誉、满载友谊、和平、知识而归的周恩来总理同志，致以崇高的敬礼！
    通过这次访问，体现了我国政府反对大国沙文主义和坚持无产阶级国际主义的精神，表达了我国人民反侵略、反战争、要和平、要与世界上任何国家“和平共处”之真诚的愿望。进一步取得了我国与这些国家相互间的谅解与合作；加强了我国与民族主义各国的团结；巩固了以苏联为首的社会主义各国相互间的团结；也促进了社会主义各国与民族主义各国以“和平共处”五项原则为基础而发生共鸣的团结，这对于保卫世界和平所作出的贡献，是非常巨大的。
　  二、中国人民真诚地愿与美国继续谈判。美国如一意孤行，中国人民决不害怕
    有人说，“美国是世界和平最大的障碍物，蒋介石没有美国撑腰，台湾早已归入祖国怀抱；如果不‘釜底抽薪’，努力改善中美关系，就很难达到和平解放台湾的目的。政府为了改进中美关系，曾经作了一系列的努力，尽管没有得到美国方面应有的反应，我们还是要继续努力，世界舆论始终是站在我国方面的”，主张继续和美国谈判。
    有人说：“美国坚持敌视中国人民的政策，无理可喻，要他坐下谈判，无异‘对牛弹琴’；要他放下屠刀，无异‘与虎谋皮’。美报最近批评政府执行驼鸟式的外交政策，我以为也可以说是执行井蛙式的外交政策，因为杜勒斯他们还在‘坐井观天’。中国解放七年多了，没有美国这个朋友，也进步很快，社会主义建设事业，已经取得了惊人的成就。美国敌视拥有物产矿藏丰富土地市场广阔的六亿中国人民，受损失的不是中国而正是美国自己。”主张不必再和美国谈判。
    这两种不同的主张，看来都是片面的，可是他们提出意见的衷心愿望是相同的，他们相同的愿望——就是中国人民要和平要进步的共同愿望。
    我国坚持执行和平外交政策，十分正确，既符合中国人民一致的愿望，也符合全世界所有一切爱好和平的人民一致的要求。依据全世界人心所向的“和平共处”五项原则，我国应该愿意、真诚地愿意继续和美国进行谈判，但是如果美国仍然执迷不悟，仍然企图制造两个中国，仍然企图永远占据台湾，仍然企图进行颠覆活动，那么中国人民就必定要竭尽一切力量给以无情的反击。我相信，我们已有足够的力量可以粉碎美帝国主义的一切诡计和阴谋。
    现在的时代，已经不是帝国主义可以称霸称雄的时代了，所谓“牛斗士”导弹，决不会吓倒中国人民；以“美援”为香饵，决不能阻挡民族主义独立运动的高潮，以反共为借口而夺取英法殖民利益的艾森豪威尔主义，更促进了帝国主义各国相互间的矛盾愈形尖锐化的危机。“见风转舵”，此其时矣，一意孤行，噬哜莫及！美国极大多数的人民是爱好和平的，美国也不乏有远见的政治家，中国人民是愿意和你们做朋友的，一同为保卫世界和平促进人类进步事业而奋斗吧！
　  三、在与印度等七个国家团结的基础上进一步改善中日中菲和中泰的关系
    日本是亚洲一个工业化的国家，刚毅果敢刻苦耐劳的日本人民，值得我们钦佩，他们现在所处的境遇，也与我们解放前的情况差不多，也是值得我们同情的。尽管我国人民过去吃了日本军国主义者不少苦头，中国人民现在还是很愿意和日本人民做朋友的。希望政府对于促使中日关系正常化，再作进一步的努力！
    巴基斯坦是参加马尼剌条约组织一个成员国，可是已经和我国建立了友好关系。从周总理访问巴基斯坦的情况来看，可以知道中巴两国人民间蕴藏着悠久的深厚的友谊。因此，尽管泰国菲律宾是马尼剌条约的重要支柱，中国人民和泰菲两国人民因悠久历史关系所蕴藏的深厚的友谊不是任何力量所能消毁的。希望政府进一步努力改善中泰关系和中菲关系。
      我国政府要努力改善中日关系、中菲关系和中泰关系，周总理在报告中都已指
  出，我为什么再特地提出来谈一谈呢？周总理访问了越南、印度、缅甸、柬埔寨、尼泊尔、阿富汗、锡兰、巴基斯坦八个亚洲国家，充分表现了亚洲人民大家庭团结之无可战胜的力量，这是令人异常兴奋的，可是目前由于客观障碍的存在，周总理没有能够到日本菲律宾泰国这三个亚洲国家去访问，不无遗憾。我国从与印度等七个亚洲国家团结的基础上，进一步开展我国与日菲泰三国的团结工作，对于巩固亚洲和平与保卫世界和平的伟大的事业，是将会取得更巨大的成就的。
　  四、世界总的趋势是走向缓和走向进步，中国总的趋势是走向繁荣走向富强
    全世界的和平和进步的力量日益壮大和巩固，已有迹象迫使美帝国主义不得不考虑放弃它在制造国际紧张局势的战争政策。周总理于报告中详细分析国际局势后指出：世界总的趋势是走向和缓、走向进步。只要全世界人民团结起来，坚持斗争，世界持久和平是可以争取得到的，这是十分正确的。这是我国建设社会主义之最有利的条件。
    我国的社会主义事业，在伟大的毛主席和党的领导下，正在突飞猛进，社会主义的三大改造，基本上已经完成了，社会主义建设的第一个五年计划也差不多已经提前一年完成了；中国各阶层人民，已经走上了社会主义的康庄大道，这是多么伟大的历史成绩呵！我们工作中也发现了一些缺点和错误，我们是勇于揭露、勇于纠正的，在生产发展过程中也遇着了不少的困难，我们不要向困难低头，尽力克服。铁的事实证明，我国的人民民主政权在政治上、经济上、军事上都有了很好的基础，可以说：已安如磐石，固若金汤，如有人敢于企图破坏、进行颠覆活动，就必会碰得头破血流，自取灭亡！
    我向周总理学习了几句话，来结束我的发言：我国总的趋势，是走向繁荣、走向富强的，只要全国人民团结起来，坚持艰苦奋斗，我国的社会主义建设事业和全世界的和平进步事业是可以由我们争取从胜利走向胜利的。完了。祝各位身体健康！（附图片）
