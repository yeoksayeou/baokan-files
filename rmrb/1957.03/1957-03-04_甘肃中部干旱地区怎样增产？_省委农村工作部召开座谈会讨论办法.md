Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, March 1st. The symposium of heads of arid areas recently convened by the Rural Work Department of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee studied how to continue changing the face of drought and strive for a bumper harvest this year.

In the arid areas of central Gansu Province, farmers in 550 arid townships of 28 counties and cities achieved great success in water conservancy construction to change the arid situation during last year's Great Production Movement. The irrigated area was expanded by more than 1.1 million mu throughout the year, of which 103 townships have basically changed the face of drought, with an average of one mu or more of irrigated land per person. This year, it is planned to continue building some water conservancy projects and expand the irrigated area by another 350,000 mu. Under these circumstances, some cadres and farmers believe that the work of changing the face of drought is "easy first and then difficult." This year, it is difficult to find water sources, and the quality requirements for work have been increased. Therefore, it is a big problem to ask for major progress again this year.

The symposium studied and analyzed these ideas and believed that this year's work in arid areas is more difficult and meticulous than in previous years, but there are also many favorable conditions. These favorable conditions are: the advanced agricultural cooperativization has been fully realized in arid areas, and the difficulties such as labor shortage can be solved; through last year's efforts, a large number of typical townships and cooperatives that have reformed the arid appearance have emerged in various places; party and government leading organs and cadres at all levels have rich experience in fighting against drought; thousands of peasant technicians have appeared in each county; and the state's investment and loans will give priority to arid areas. All these favorable conditions are a strong guarantee for changing the face of arid areas.

The symposium believes that how to use the above-mentioned favorable conditions, the key issue lies in leadership. Therefore, the symposium studied some issues that should be paid attention to in leading farmers to change the face of drought.

    甘肃中部干旱地区怎样增产？
    省委农村工作部召开座谈会讨论办法
    新华社兰州1日电  中共甘肃省委农村工作部最近召开的干旱地区负责人座谈会，研究了如何继续改变干旱面貌争取今年大丰收的问题。
    甘肃省中部干旱地区二十八个县、市五百五十个干旱乡的农民，在去年大生产运动中，在兴修水利改变干旱状况上获得了很大成就，全年扩大灌溉面积一百一十多万亩，其中有一百零三个乡基本上改变了干旱面貌，平均每人已有一亩或一亩以上的水地。今年准备继续兴修一些水利工程，再扩大灌溉面积三十五万亩。在这种情况下，有的干部和农民便认为改变干旱面貌工作是“先易后难”，今年水源难找了，再加上对工作的质量要求提高，因此，今年再要求取得重大进展就是很大问题。
    座谈会针对这些想法进行了研究和分析，认为今年干旱地区的工作比往年艰巨细致，但也存在着许多有利条件。这些有利的条件是：干旱地区已经完全实现了高级农业合作化，劳动力不足等困难可以解决；各地经过去年的努力，出现了大批改革干旱面貌的典型乡和社；各级党政领导机关和干部有向干旱作斗争的丰富经验；每县出现了数以千计的农民技术员；国家的投资和贷款又将优先照顾干旱地区。所有这些有利条件，都是改变干旱地区面貌的有力保证。
    座谈会认为，如何利用上述有利条件，关键问题在于领导。因此，座谈会研究了在领导农民改变干旱面貌的工作中，应该要注意的一些问题。
