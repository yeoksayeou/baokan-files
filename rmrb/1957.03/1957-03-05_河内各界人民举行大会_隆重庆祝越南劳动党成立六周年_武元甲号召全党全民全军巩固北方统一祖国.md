Vo Nguyen Giap, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, delivered a report at the meeting.

He emphasized that 1957 is an important year in the path of the Vietnamese people's progress. He called on the entire party, people, army, and cadres to work harder to restore the national economy to the level of 1939 this year; at the same time, it is necessary to work hard to consolidate national defense, expand the united front of the Vietnamese people against U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, and strive to restore normal relations between North and South Vietnam.

In his report, Vo Nguyen Giap particularly emphasized the great significance of further enhancing the leadership role and work efficiency of the Vietnam Workers' Party, enhancing the fighting will and revolutionary character of party members, and strengthening solidarity with fraternal countries and the people of the world. He said that if these points can be done well, the Vietnamese people will be able to overcome the obstacles and difficulties imposed on them by the imperialists, enabling North Vietnam to gradually transition to socialism and victoriously achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

In their speeches, they believed that the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party was correct and expressed their gratitude to the Labor Party for leading the Vietnamese people to achieve revolutionary victory.
