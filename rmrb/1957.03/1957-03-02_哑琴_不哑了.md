    “The Dumb Zither” Is No Longer Dumb
    Wang Rongxuan

    Facing the cool breeze of early spring, and bypassing the winding mountain roads, we arrived at a coastal village on a certain island at the East Sea front along with naval comrades. At the bend at the end of the village was a small house, and we stopped here. At this time, a girl who was sewing a quilt in the patio put down her needle and thread and busily moved stools, poured tea, and warmly welcomed us. Sitting in front of her was a doctor named Comrade Gu Guang, wearing a naval uniform with a red cross kit. He casually picked up a teapot and turned to the girl, "Teapot," she spoke in a clear Ningbo accent. The doctor's hand pointed here and there. "Thermos," "chopsticks"... As the doctor's fingers moved, the girl twisted the braid in front of her chest shyly, saying the names of various objects in the house. A comrade next to me told me that she used to be a mute, and had only recently been cured by this doctor using acupuncture.

    This happened one summer. At that time, Gu Guang had been on the island for five years, and he had always been enthusiastic about treating illnesses for the fishermen. He sometimes braved stormy nights to see patients for the masses, and sometimes braved rough seas to provide emergency treatment to fishermen on outer islands. The fishermen on the island affectionately called him "Doctor Gu." One Sunday, a young girl suddenly appeared in the crowd waiting for treatment. Her mother said to Doctor Gu Guang, "Comrade, my daughter is a mute, please try to cure her." "A mute!" Gu Guang was stunned. Although he knew very well that it would be very difficult to cure this disease, he deeply sympathized with this person who had lost the right to speak, and was determined to do everything possible to treat her. So, he tried to treat her using the acupuncture he had learned in the past. "She can't speak, and she can't hear. It's really difficult!" he thought. The first acupuncture treatment made the patient faint. The experiment failed, and Gu Guang was distressed about it. He said to his comrades, "If one day I can really cure her, and she says 'thank you' to me, I will be so happy." He read many books on acupuncture, and then took the time to treat mutes specifically. During this period, he often dreamed at night that the mute could speak, and laughed happily. More than two months passed, and acupuncture had been performed more than ten times, but it was still ineffective. Once, he followed the method described in the book and inserted a needle into the throat area, and suddenly heard a "Wah!" This was the first time he had heard this girl make a sound since treating her, and the girl's face showed a smile for the first time. Gu Guang was overjoyed, walking two steps at a time, and shouted loudly: "Instructor! Come quickly, the mute can speak." Instructor Wang Peiyou and his comrades ran over with surprised expressions and applauded the "mute". At this time, she stroked her chest with both hands, expressing infinite joy in her heart. Gu Guang understood that he should use real objects to teach the mute. He touched his hair, and then took off his shoes, "Hair", "Shoes"... Her voice became clearer and clearer. She ran home in one breath, took her mother's hand and shouted "Mom", the mother looked at her daughter in surprise, and was so happy that she couldn't speak for a long time. Now she is learning to speak word by word with others like a child.

    In the past, because she was a mute, people gave her the name Yaqin, which means that the zither is dumb and has no sound. Now, "The Dumb Zither is no longer dumb." The fishermen said this sentence with respect for the People's Liberation Army.

    “哑琴”不哑了
    王荣宣
    迎着初春的凉风，绕过了弯弯曲曲的山路，随同海军同志们来到了东海前线某岛的海滨村庄。在村的尽头拐弯处，是一间矮小的房屋，我们就在这里停下了脚步。这时，正在天井里缝补被絮的一个姑娘，放下了针线，忙去搬凳、倒茶，热情地招待我们。坐在她面前的是一位背着红十字挂包、身穿海军士兵服的医生顾光同志。他顺手端起一把茶壶，脸转向这位姑娘，“茶壶”，她嘴里发出了清晰的宁波口音。医生的手一会儿指到这里，一会儿又指到那里。“热水瓶”、“筷子”……随着医生手指的移动，姑娘一只手搓着胸前的辫子，含羞地讲着屋子里各式各样物件的名称。旁边一位同志告诉我说，她原来是个哑叭，不久前才由这位医生用针灸疗法给她治好的。
    这件事情发生在一个夏天。那时，顾光来到岛上已有五年多光景了，他向来热心为渔民群众治病。他有时冒着狂风暴雨的深夜为群众看病，有时冒着惊涛骇浪出海替外岛渔民急诊，岛上的渔民都亲切地称呼他“顾医生”。一个星期日，在候诊的人群里，忽然出现了一位年轻的姑娘。她的妈妈向医生顾光说：“同志，我的女儿是个哑叭，请你给治一治吧。”“是个哑叭！”顾光愕了一下，他虽然明明知道治这个病是很困难的，但他深深同情着这位失去了讲话权利的人，决心想尽办法为她医治。于是，他凭借着以往学过的针灸疗法试着医治。“她自己不会讲话，耳朵又听不见。真难哪！”他这样想。第一次施行针灸，病人就晕了过去。试验失败了，顾光为这件事苦恼着。他对同志们说：“要是有一天我真能替她治好了，她会向我说声‘谢谢’，那我真是太幸福了。”他又看了许多关于针灸学的著作，然后又抽出时间专为哑叭进行治疗。在这段期间里，他晚上常常在梦里听到哑叭会讲话了，高兴得大笑起来。两个多月的时间过去了，针灸已进行了十几次，但仍不见效。有一次，他按照书上讲的方法，往喉管部位扎了一针，忽然听到“哇！”地一声；这是自从给她治病以来第一次听到这个姑娘发出来的声音，姑娘的脸上也第一次露出了笑容。顾光高兴极了，两步并成一步地走着，高声叫：“指导员！快来呀，哑叭会讲话了。”指导员王培友和同志们怀着惊奇的神情跑来向“哑叭”鼓掌祝贺。这时，她用双手抚摩着自己的胸口，表示内心有无限的喜悦。顾光懂得对哑叭要用实物教学的方法，他摸着自己的头发，继而又脱下了自己的鞋子，“头发”、“鞋子”……她的声音越发清楚了。她一口气跑到了家里，拉着母亲的手喊着“姆妈”，母亲惊奇地望着自己的女儿，高兴得半天没说出话来。现在她像小孩一样，一个字一个字地跟着别人学讲话了。
    以前，因为她是一个哑叭，人家给她取名叫哑琴，意思是琴哑了就没有声音了。现在，“哑琴不哑了”。渔民们怀着对人民解放军崇敬的心情说着这句话。
