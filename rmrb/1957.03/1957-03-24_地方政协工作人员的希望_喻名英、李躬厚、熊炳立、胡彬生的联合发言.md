Hopes of Local CPPCC Workers
Joint Speech by Yu Mingying, Li Gonghou, Xiong Bingli, and Hu Binsheng

We come from the local CPPCC in Hunan. As industrialists and businessmen from a small city, we feel extremely honored and infinitely encouraged to be able to attend such a grand meeting as observers and to have personally heard Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference before the meeting. During the meeting, we listened to Premier Zhou's "Report on Visits to Eleven Asian and European Countries" and various other reports and speeches by leading comrades, which further clarified the general trend of the current world situation and the correct direction of our country's socialist construction. We wholeheartedly support these.

In the spring of 1956, after the implementation of joint state-private ownership of all private enterprises, the nature of private enterprises underwent fundamental changes. Along with this new change, the broad masses of industrialists and businessmen put forward the demand to study political theory and strengthen self-transformation. To this end, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference made the "Decision on Organizing Democratic Personages and Industrialists and Businessmen from All Walks of Life to Conduct Political and Theoretical Study" in March last year. Since the opening of short-term study classes for industrialists and businessmen by local CPPCCs, great results have indeed been achieved. Through short-term study, many industrialists and businessmen have initially recognized the laws of social development and further understood the Party's policy of peaceful transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. After returning to their enterprises upon graduation, their work enthusiasm has generally improved, and their work attitude has also progressed. This shows that industrialists and businessmen can gradually achieve transformation through study, and it also embodies the correctness of the Party's policy of peaceful transformation. However, there are still a very small number of people who have a resistant attitude towards learning, believing that since the relations of production have already changed and antagonistic class contradictions no longer exist, there is no need for transformation. Therefore, they behave arrogantly, disobey leadership, or work passively and irresponsibly, saying things like "Wages are paid according to labor, so work is done according to payment; the more money you get, the more work you do," and even engaging in illegal acts such as embezzlement and misappropriation of public funds. We believe that all of this is completely wrong. Although capitalist ownership has undergone fundamental changes due to joint state-private ownership of all enterprises, it cannot completely eliminate the profit-seeking nature of the bourgeoisie. Moreover, the ideological transformation of our industrialists and businessmen is still far behind the development of the objective situation. Therefore, the dual nature of the Chinese national bourgeoisie still exists. In order to reduce and even eliminate the negative side and increase the positive side, we must further strengthen our study, accept transformation, and completely eliminate those old, capitalist remnants. Otherwise, the negative side will not only exist but will also grow and expand.

Regarding Suggestions for Strengthening the Political Study of Industrialists and Businessmen

We recognize that the ideological transformation of industrialists and businessmen is a long-term task. Although we have achieved some successes and accumulated some experience in leading and promoting industrialists and businessmen to conduct political and theoretical study, the task of doing this work well is still very arduous. Taking short-term study classes as an example, generally only two sessions have been held so far. It is estimated that it will not be possible to basically complete the rotational training until 1958. Moreover, after graduation from the study classes, it is still necessary to provide vigorous assistance and guidance to consolidate their learning results so that they can continue to carry out self-education and self-transformation in their work and business practices. All of this still depends on our continued efforts. Regarding the political study of industrialists and businessmen, we have collected the following two opinions:

(1) The issue of teachers and teaching materials for short-term study classes for industrialists and businessmen is the key to doing a good job in study. Small cities especially lack teachers for the study classes. The content of the teaching materials is also not entirely suitable for the needs. It is suggested that in terms of teachers, the provincial CPPCCs should appropriately allocate forces to supplement full-time lecturers. At the same time, it is also requested that Party committees at all levels give part-time lecturers sufficient time to prepare lessons to strengthen the quality of teaching. In terms of teaching materials, please ask the National Committee of the CPPCC to collect teaching materials from various localities, learn from each other's strengths, and compile a more comprehensive textbook.

(2) Professional companies and public representatives generally support the study of industrialists and businessmen, but some professional companies and some public representatives in some places unilaterally emphasize business and still consider the study of industrialists and businessmen to be insufficiently important. For example, after some people graduate from the study classes, because of the limitations of their theoretical and cultural level, they cannot study with other cadres and must organize separate studies, and sometimes study time cannot be guaranteed. In order to consolidate their learning experiences and further improve their ideological level, it is requested that the National Committee of the CPPCC contact relevant departments and provide vigorous assistance.

Regarding the work of local CPPCCs, due to the correct leadership of the higher-level CPPCCs and the local Party committees, the work has indeed been strengthened year by year. Significant achievements have been made in political consultation, organizing people from all walks of life to study, and contacting people in society. We believe that local CPPCCs should continue to actively strive for the leadership of higher-level CPPCCs and local Party committees in the future to further strengthen various tasks and give full play to the active role of the people's democratic united front.

Regarding Suggestions for Strengthening the Work of Local CPPCCs

In addition, in order to do a good job in the work of local CPPCCs, we put forward two immature opinions and requirements.

First, small cities still lack cadres and buildings for the CPPCC. Small cities generally only have one cadre for the CPPCC. In the past, some places did not even have a cadre. The scope of work of the CPPCC is extremely broad, and the members cannot handle daily affairs because they all have positions to work in. Therefore, we believe that appropriately increasing one or two cadres according to the actual needs of the local area is beneficial to promoting the work of the CPPCC. The buildings of the CPPCCs in small cities also still have some individual difficulties. Some do not have suitable meeting places, some meeting places are very remote, and some only have a small office. Because the buildings are not suitable or insufficient, the development of daily activities is limited to some extent. We hope that the higher-level CPPCCs and the local Party committees will assist in resolving these issues.

Second, it is requested that all members, when inspecting work in the future, also inspect the work of the local committees of the CPPCC. Because through inspection, not only can the leadership of the local CPPCC be strengthened, but at the same time, we will also receive great encouragement in our work. Therefore, we sincerely welcome the members of the higher-level CPPCCs to come down to inspect and guide our work, so that we can do the work of the local CPPCCs more and better.

Our knowledge is very shallow. Please criticize and correct any inappropriate remarks in our speech. (Attached picture)

### 地方政协工作人员的希望　喻名英、李躬厚、熊炳立、胡彬生的联合发言

　　地方政协工作人员的希望
　　喻名英、李躬厚、熊炳立、胡彬生的联合发言
    我们来自湖南地方政协，以一个小城市的工商业者，能列席这样盛大的会议，而且在开会之前亲听了毛主席在最高国务会议的讲话，使我们感到无比的光荣，得到无限的鼓舞。在会议当中听了周总理“关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告”和其他首长的各项报告与发言，使我们进一步明确了当前世界总的趋势和我国社会主义建设的正确方向，我们都衷心拥护。
    1956年春，资本主义工商业实行全业公私合营以后，私营企业的性质已经起了根本的变化。随着这一新的变化，广大的工商业者，提出了学习政治理论、加强自我改造的要求，为此，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会于去年三月作出了“关于组织各界民主人士和工商业者进行政治学习和理论学习的决定”，各地政协根据这一决定，举办了工商界短期讲习班。开办以来，确实收到了很大的效果。很多工商业者通过短期学习，初步认清了社会发展的规律，进一步理解了党对资本主义工商业实行和平改造的方针政策。结业后回到企业，工作积极性一般的都有所提高，工作态度也有了进步。这就说明了工商业者是可以通过学习逐步获得改造的，同时也体现了党的和平改造政策的正确性。但是，也还有极少一部分人，对学习抱有抵触情绪，认为生产关系既已改变，对抗性的阶级矛盾不复存在，用不着改造了。因此，他们在行动上就表现骄傲自大，不服从领导，或工作消极，不负责任，说什么“工资按劳取酬，工作就按酬付劳，拿好多钱，做好多事”，甚至还有贪污和挪用公款等不法行为发生。我们认为这都是完全错误的。资本主义所有制虽因全业公私合营而起了根本性的变化，但是，决不能使资产阶级唯利是图的本质完全消灭，何况当前我们工商业者的思想改造还远远落后于客观形势的发展呢？因此，中国民族资产阶级的两面性还是存在的。为了减少以至消灭消极的一面，增长积极的一面，我们还必须进一步加强学习，接受改造，把那些旧的、资本主义的残余东西完全肃清。否则，消极的一面，不但会存在，而且会滋长扩大。关于加强工商业者政治学习的意见
    我们认识到工商业者的思想改造是一个长期性的工作。虽然在领导和推动工商业者进行政治理论学习方面，我们已经取得了一些成绩和经验。但是，要做好这一工作，任务仍然是非常艰巨的。就以短期讲习班来说，目前一般都还只办了两期，预计要到1958年才能基本上轮训完毕，而且讲习班结业以后，也还需要大力予以帮助辅导，以巩固他们的学习成果，使他们能够在工作和业务实践中，继续进行自我教育和自我改造。所有这些都还有赖我们继续努力。关于工商业者的政治学习问题，我们搜集了下面的两点意见：
    （一）工商业者短期讲习班的师资和教材问题，是搞好学习的关键问题，小城市的讲习班对师资尤感缺乏。教材内容，也不尽适合需要。建议在师资方面，由各省政协适当配备力量，以充实专职讲师，同时，也要求各级党委给兼职讲师充分的备课时间，以加强教学质量。在教材方面，请政协全国委员会汇集各地教材，取长补短，编纂一本较为全面的教材。
      （二）专业公司和公方代表对工商业者的学习大都是支持的，但有些地方的专业公司和部分公方代表，片面强调业务，对工商业者的学习，仍嫌重视不够。例如：有些人在讲习班结业以后，因为理论与文化水平的限制不能与其他干部一起学习而要另外组织学习时，学习时间有时得不到保证。为了巩固他们的学习心得，进一步提高他们的思想水平，要求政协全国委员会与有关部门联系，大力予以帮助。
    关于地方政协工作，由于上级政协和当地党委的正确领导，工作的确是逐年加强了。无论在政治协商、组织各界人士学习、联系社会人士等方面都做出了显著的成绩。我们认为各地方政协今后仍应积极争取上级政协和当地党委的领导，以便进一步加强各项工作，充分发挥人民民主统一战线的积极作用。关于加强地方政协工作的意见
    此外，为了搞好地方政协的工作，我们提出两点不成熟的意见和要求。
    首先，是小城市的政协还缺乏干部和房屋的问题。小城市的政协一般只有干部一人，过去有的地方还没有干部。政协的工作范围极为广泛，委员们又因都有岗位工作而不能处理日常事务。因此，我们认为按照当地的实际需要，适当的增加一名或两名干部，对推动政协工作是有好处的。小城市政协的房屋也还个别的存在着一些困难。有的还没有适当的会址，有的会址非常偏僻，有的仅有一间很小的办公室。由于房屋不适当或不够，在某种程度上限制了日常活动的开展。这些都希望上级政协和当地党委协助解决。
    其次，是要求各位委员在今后视察工作时，同时视察政协地方委员会的工作。因为通过视察，不但可以加强对地方政协的领导，同时，我们在工作上也将会得到莫大的鼓舞，所以，我们竭诚欢迎上级政协的委员们下来检查指导我们的工作，使我们能把地方政协的工作做得更多更好。
    我们的见识非常浅薄，发言不当之处，敬请各位委员批评指正。（附图片）
