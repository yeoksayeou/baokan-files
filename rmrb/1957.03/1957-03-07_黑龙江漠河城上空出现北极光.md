    Aurora Borealis Appears Over Mohe City, Heilongjiang
    On the night of March 2nd, a rare aurora borealis appeared over Mohe City in Heilongjiang Province, our country's northernmost region.
    As the winter night quietly descended upon Mohe City, the moonless sky was dotted with a few cold stars. Around seven o'clock, a cluster of crimson and brilliant rosy clouds suddenly rose up. The rosy clouds slowly ascended, and in an instant, they transformed into an arc-shaped band of light, like a summer rainbow, rising from the waist of the Yablonovy Mountains and stretching from above the Heilongjiang River towards the south of the Greater Khingan Range. This bright rainbow radiated strange and colorful lights, like the morning glow at dawn, reddening the northern sky. This aurora borealis lingered in the night sky for forty-five minutes.
    According to historical records, an aurora borealis occurred in Huma County in 1939. Typically, the aurora borealis appears mostly at midnight, but this time it appeared much earlier.

### 黑龙江漠河城上空出现北极光

    黑龙江漠河城上空出现北极光
    3月2日夜晚，我国极北地方黑龙江省的漠河城上空，出现了少有的北极光。
    当冬夜悄悄地降临到漠河城的时候，无月的天空布着些寒星。七时许，一团殷红灿烂的霞光，倏然地升腾起来。霞光冉冉上升，一瞬间变成了一条弧形的光带，像夏天的彩虹一般，从雅布洛威山岭腰部升起，从黑龙江的上空伸向大兴安岭的南方。这条鲜艳的彩虹放射出奇光异彩，像拂晓的朝霞，映红了北方的天空。这道北极光在夜空中滞留了四十五分钟。
    据史料记载，1939年在呼玛县曾出现一次北极光。按例，北极光出现多半是在午夜，但这次出现的时间却早了很多。
