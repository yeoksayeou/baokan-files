    To Refine More Steel
    In order to ensure the constancy of the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement, the state-owned Guangzhou General Machinery Factory continues to strengthen the factory's internal economic accounting system. The steel casting workshop, which pioneered the implementation of the班组核算制(team accounting system), has achieved significant results in reducing actual costs and improving the quality of cast steel.
