    Liu Yaozhang Hopes That the People and Military and Government Personnel of Taiwan Will Contribute to the Peaceful Reunification of the Motherland
      Having listened to Premier Zhou's report, I was deeply moved. I believe that this report will have a significant impact internationally and in Taiwan, because everything in the report fully conforms to objective reality and fully expresses the wishes of the Chinese people.
    (1) While Living in Happiness, We Cannot Forget the Suffering of the People of Taiwan
    Without a doubt, we urgently need socialist peaceful construction. Although our first Five-Year Plan has only been implemented for four years, we have already achieved brilliant successes in all aspects of construction. For example, the annual output of steel has increased several times compared to old China, and the grain output, despite being affected by natural disasters, is still increasing year by year. Railways and highways closely connect the remote border regions with the interior. The Sanmenxia water conservancy project, aimed at controlling the Yellow River which has been a scourge for thousands of years, will begin construction this year. On the highways, we see our self-made cars speeding along, and in the sky, we see our own produced airplanes soaring. The material and cultural life of the people throughout the country has generally improved. The face of cities and villages is changing with each passing day.
    Should we be complacent about this? No, we still need about three Five-Year Plans to build our motherland into a great socialist industrialized country. We love our construction, and therefore sincerely seek peace. Internationally, we hope to coexist peacefully with all countries with different social systems; domestically, we are willing to complete the final cause of the reunification of the motherland through the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.
    Taiwan is a part of China's territory. The people of Taiwan have flesh-and-blood relations with us. While the lives of our compatriots on the mainland are thriving, we have never for a moment forgotten that the people of Taiwan are still in a painful situation. Under the policy of uniting all forces that can be united, we have long hoped that the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan can bravely return to the embrace of the motherland under the banner of "patriotism as one family."
    I believe that this idea of ours is very likely consistent with the people of Taiwan and the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan. The Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan have already suffered enough from the long and arduous exile outside the mainland of the motherland. If American imperialism provokes a war in the Taiwan region, the danger to the people of Taiwan and the military and government personnel in Taiwan is unimaginable. Under the current circumstances, on the one hand, American imperialism is rampant in Taiwan, intensifying its bullying and manipulation, and on the other hand, the motherland is actively building and its international reputation is growing, it is understandable that "more and more Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan are willing to promote peaceful liberation."
    (2) After the Peaceful Liberation of Taiwan, You Will Work and Live Happily with Compatriots on the Mainland
    What will the work and life of the people of Taiwan and the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan be like after the peaceful liberation of Taiwan? I think they should have no worries about this today.
      With the abundance of Taiwan's resources and the diligence and wisdom of the people of Taiwan, the people of Taiwan will certainly have plenty of "room for their talents" in the construction after liberation. Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan can also play their due role if they have a skill after returning to the motherland. Please see, after the liberation of the mainland, which person with knowledge and experience is not bearing a certain responsibility and actively working in government departments, organizations, or schools! I, an ordinary person, have also played a small role in the administrative aspect of the Ministry of Water Resources in recent years. The water conservancy agency was a neglected department in the Kuomintang government, but today, with the increasing demands of the people for water management, its tasks are becoming heavier day by day. Agricultural technology, which used to be despised, my eldest son studied agronomy, and after liberation, he took on agricultural technical work at a state-owned farm. Not only is he not as bored as he was before liberation, but he has also learned a lot in his intense work. In the past, graduates from general universities were unemployed, but my second son was assigned to the heavy industry sector immediately after graduating in 1950, and his technical level has gradually improved through practice to this day. These simple examples illustrate that in the development of the national construction cause, anyone who wants to participate in the construction ranks and serve the people will not be unwelcome.
    Social life after liberation is also very different from before. Scenes of "hedonism and extravagance" have long disappeared. The younger generation is not easy to experience the scene of "the rich stink of meat and wine, while the roads are filled with frozen bones." Our wage income is secure, production is developing, prices are stable, schools, hospitals, theaters, and parks are constantly increasing, and ordinary people not only reduce their worries about life but can also arrange their lives largely according to their own wishes.
    Is there democracy and freedom under the people's democratic government? I think that only in people's democratic countries can one experience and enjoy democracy and freedom. Our people's democracy is that the broad masses of the people can enjoy democracy. Our socialist democracy guarantees the victory of socialism in China. This democracy is for the purpose of improving the people's lives, not like in capitalist countries to decorate the facade, specially to paralyze the people for the capitalists. Kuomintang military and government personnel all know the so-called "public opinion organs" before liberation, right? I was once a "member of the National Political Council" and wanted to propose a proposal to "eradicate corruption" (in fact, the content was very empty), but it was not allowed to be put forward. I was also once the "Speaker of the Hebei Provincial Provisional Senate." Looking back, what did that work do other than to maintain the declining and corrupt regime, while also benefiting those landlords, gentry, and bureaucratic capitalists! Can such "public opinion organs" smell the slightest breath of democracy and freedom! In the past, some Kuomintang friends had yearned for the American version of democracy and freedom, but look, blacks are subjected to inhuman treatment in the United States, American journalists are deprived of the freedom to visit China, and the Un-American Activities Committee is intensifying its persecution of fair-minded people. Where is American democracy and freedom! If you fantasize that American imperialism will offer some democracy and freedom to Taiwan, it is simply like climbing a tree to catch a fish!
    Only our people's democratic government hopes that the people will express their opinions without reservation and opposes "reporting only good news and not bad news." Among individuals, mutual criticism is advocated; among democratic parties, mutual supervision is advocated; on academic issues, the call is for "a hundred schools of thought to contend." All the shortcomings, errors, and different opinions in our work are corrected, remedied, and unified through such channels. This is true and concrete democracy and freedom!
    In short, after the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, the people of Taiwan and the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan will certainly be able to work safely, live happily, and fully enjoy the rights of democracy and freedom just like their compatriots on the mainland.
    (3) Distinguish Right from Wrong, Distinguish Interests from Harms, and Do Not Hesitate or Wait and See Any Longer
    So, what is the current obstacle? Obviously, it is the mischief of American imperialism.
    The tense situation in the Taiwan region is consciously created by American imperialism. It attempts to use the excuse of the tense situation to occupy Taiwan as its base of aggression, and the so-called "US-Chiang Treaty" is its talisman for occupying Taiwan. Recently, seeing that "the possibility of peaceful liberation of Taiwan is increasing," it is again instigating so-called "free elements" and "independent elements" to overthrow the current Taiwan authorities in order to further control Taiwan as its territory like Honolulu. Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan should understand that the fate of being parasitic under the aegis of imperialism will ultimately not be spared from being abandoned, sacrificed, or made into a stepping stone for imperialist military aggression.
    Premier Zhou said: "The general trend of the world is towards relaxation and progress. The forces of peace are constantly growing stronger, and the forces of war are becoming increasingly isolated." But American imperialism is not reconciled to its failure. Its plot to create "two Chinas" is deliberately undermining the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and harming the peaceful interests of Asia and even the world.
    Will you eliminate the obstacles to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and contribute to the peaceful reunification of the motherland, or will you succumb to the intentions of American imperialism, listen to its enslavement, and never want to turn over? This is a question of patriotism. This is a question of unity against foreign countries. Right and wrong, interests and harms, are in front of you, as clear as black and white. I hope that the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan will make up their minds, muster their courage, and immediately make concrete contributions to promoting the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, without any further hesitation or waiting and seeing! I believe that, as Premier Zhou said, "The general trend of Taiwan's return to the embrace of the motherland is unstoppable, and no force in the world can permanently separate Chinese people from Chinese people."

### 刘瑶章希望台湾人民和军政人员　对祖国的和平统一作出贡献

    刘瑶章希望台湾人民和军政人员
　　对祖国的和平统一作出贡献
      听了周总理的报告，我非常感动。我相信这个报告在国际上和台湾都将发生很大的影响。因为报告的一切完全符合客观的现实，也充分表达了中国人民的愿望。
    （一）我们身在幸福当中难忘台湾人民遭受的苦痛
    毫无疑问，我们急切地需要社会主义的和平建设。我们的第一个五年计划虽然才执行了四年，在建设的各方面已经取得了辉煌的成就。例如，钢铁的年产量比旧中国增加了好几倍，粮食的产量，纵然受着自然灾害的侵扰，仍是逐年上升，铁路、公路把遥远的边疆和内地紧密地联系起来，针对着几千年为害的黄河，三门峡水利枢纽工程今年就要施工。公路上有我们自制的汽车在奔驰，天空中看到了我们自己生产的飞机在翱翔。全国人民的物质生活和文化生活普遍地提高了。城市和乡村的面貌无一不是日新而月异。
    我们是不是以此自满呢？不，我们还要大约在三个五年计划的时间内把祖国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义工业化的国家。我们热爱自己的建设，因而衷心地寻求和平。在国际上，我们希望和一切不同社会制度的国家和平共处；在国内，我们愿意通过和平解放台湾的方式来完成祖国统一的最后事业。
    台湾是中国领土的一部分。台湾的人民同我们有着骨肉的关系。当着大陆上的同胞们的生活蒸蒸日上的时候，我们不曾一刻忘记了台湾人民还处在痛苦的境地。在团结一切可以团结的力量的政策下，我们也早就盼望台湾的国民党军政人员能在“爱国一家”的旗帜下勇敢地回到祖国的怀抱中来。
    我相信我们的这种想法和台湾人民以及台湾国民党军政人员是很可能一致的。台湾国民党军政人员对漫漫长夜地流亡在祖国大陆以外的苦头已经吃够了。如果美帝国主义万一挑起了台湾地区的战争，对于台湾人民和台湾军政人员更是不堪设想的凶险。在目前一方面是美帝国主义在台湾横行霸道、欺侮玩弄的加剧，一方面是祖国积极建设、国际声望日隆的情况下，“台湾国民党军政人员中愿意促进和平解放的人越来越多”是可以理解的。
    （二）台湾和平解放以后你们会同大陆同胞一起愉快地工作和生活
    台湾和平解放以后，台湾人民和台湾国民党军政人员的工作和生活将是怎样呢？我想，到了今天，他们应当已经毫无顾虑。
      以台湾资源的丰富和台湾人民的勤劳智慧，在解放后的建设中，台湾人民当然大有“用武之地”。台湾国民党军政人员，返回祖国以后，即使有一技之长，也大可以发挥它应有的作用。请看，大陆解放以后，那一个有学识、有经验的人不是在机关、团体或学校中负着一定的责任、积极地在工作着呢！平凡的我，几年来在水利部行政方面也还起了些许的作用。水利机关在国民党的政府机关中是冷衙门，今天却是随着人民治水要求的提高，任务一天比一天加重。农业技术，过去是被人轻视的，我的大儿子是学农艺的，解放后担任了一个国营农场的农业技术工作，不但不像解放前那样闲的无聊，而且在紧张的工作中学习了不少东西。过去一般大学毕业就是失业，我的二儿子，在1950年毕业后马上分配到重工业部门，迄今他的技术水平通过了实践也逐步有所提高。这些简单的事例说明了，在国家建设事业的发展中，对于任何要求参加建设行列、为人民服务的人是不会不欢迎的。
    解放后的社会生活，比以前也大不相同了。“花天酒地，纸醉金迷”的场面早已绝迹。“朱门酒肉臭，路有冻死骨”的景象在年轻的人已经不容易体会到了。我们的工资收入是牢靠的，生产是发展的，物价是稳定的，学校、医院、剧院、公园在不断地增加着，一般人不但减少了生活的顾虑，而且可以大体上按照自己的意愿安排生活。
    人民民主政府下究竟有没有民主和自由呢？我看，只有在人民民主国家里才能体会到并享受到民主和自由。我们的人民民主是广大的人民都能享受到民主。我们的社会主义民主是保证着社会主义在中国的胜利。这个民主，是为了达到改善人民生活的目的，而不是像资本主义国家那样用来装饰门面，专替资本家麻痹人民。国民党军政人员都知道解放前的所谓“民意机关”吧？我当过“国民参政会参政员”，想提一个“根绝贪污”的提案（其实，内容很空泛）都不允许提出来。我也当过“河北省临时参议会议长”，回想起来，那一段工作除了为了维护没落的腐败政权，同时便宜了那些地主、豪绅和官僚资本家以外还有什么！像这样“民意机关”嗅得出丝毫的民主自由的气息吗！过去有些国民党的朋友曾经憧憬着美国版的民主自由，那么，看看，黑人在美国受着非人的待遇，美国记者被剥夺了访华的自由，非美活动调查委员会正在变本加厉地迫害公正人士。美国的民主自由到底在那里呢！如果幻想美帝国主义会奉送若干民主和自由给台湾，这简直是缘木求鱼！
    惟有我们的人民民主政府是希望人民无保留地发表意见，而且反对“报喜不报忧”的。个人间，提倡相互批评；民主党派间，主张相互监督；在学术问题上，号召“百家争鸣”。我们所有工作中的缺点、错误和不同的意见，都是经过这样的途径来改正、补救和统一。这才是真实的、具体的民主和自由！
    总之，台湾和平解放以后，台湾人民和台湾国民党军政人员一定能和祖国大陆同胞一样地安全地工作，愉快地生活，充分地享受民主自由的权利。
    （三）明是非，别利害，不要再迟疑观望
    那么，目前的障碍是什么呢？显然就是美帝国主义的作祟。
    台湾地区的紧张局势是美帝国主义有意识地造成的。它企图借口紧张局势来盘据台湾做为它的侵略基地，而所谓“美蒋条约”便是它要盘据台湾的符咒。最近它眼看着“和平解放台湾的可能性越来越大了”，于是又在策动所谓“自由分子”和“独立分子”来推翻现在的台湾当局，以达到更进一步地控制台湾做为它的檀香山般的属地。台湾国民党军政人员应该明白，在帝国主义卵翼下寄生的下场最后都将不免于被抛弃、被牺牲，或者做了帝国主义的军事侵略的垫脚石。
    周总理说：“世界总的趋势是走向和缓、走向进步的。和平的力量正在不断地壮大，战争的势力已经越来越加孤立。”但是美帝国主义还不甘心它的失败。它制造“两个中国”的阴谋正是蓄意破坏台湾的和平解放，并损害亚洲以至世界的和平利益。
    排除和平解放台湾的障碍，对祖国的和平统一有所贡献呢，还是屈从美帝国主义的意图，听任它的奴役、永世不想翻身呢？这是一个爱国主义的问题。这是一个团结对外的问题。是和非，利和害，摆在眼前，黑白分明极了。希望台湾国民党军政人员下定决心，鼓起勇气，马上对促进和平解放台湾做出具体的贡献，不需要再有所迟疑或观望！我相信像周总理所说的，“台湾回到祖国怀抱的大势是不可阻挡的，世界上没有任何力量可以把中国人同中国人永远分割开来。”（附图片）
