Observations from a Visit to North Africa
Qi Weili, Head of the Chinese International Trade Promotion Committee Trade Delegation

Our trade delegation, invited to the Fourth International Fair of Tunisia, arrived in Tunis in October 1956 for a friendly visit. After the fair, we also visited Morocco and Libya. Here, I would like to share some of my observations from my visit to North Africa with the readers.

	Tunisia

The Fourth International Fair of Tunisia was held from October 13 to 29, 1956, with sixteen countries participating. Tunisia also exhibited its products in agriculture, industry, handicrafts, and mining. In its exhibition hall, the bright red flag with a crescent moon and a five-pointed star was hung, showing the new atmosphere of Tunisia after its independence. A total of 420,000 people visited the fair, more than any previous session.

At the information desk we set up in the exhibition hall, people surrounded us every day, not only importers and exporters who came to discuss trade issues, but also workers, farmers, students, women, and young people who came to inquire about China's construction: how workers improve their skills; what procedures are required for students to study in China; how to write Chinese characters; the contributions of Chinese youth to national construction... Even Arab women, with their heads covered in white cloth, revealing only their eyes, came to learn about what clothes Chinese women wear and what the status of Chinese women is at home. They were excited when their questions were answered.

The China Tea Export Company entrusted a friendly company to build a Chinese-style tea pavilion at the fair, with the four large characters "Chinese Green Tea" written horizontally at the entrance. On the opening day, Tunisian Prime Minister Bourguiba came to the Chinese tea pavilion for a cup of tea. He praised the fragrant aroma of Chinese tea. The sales department attached to the tea pavilion provided free boiled black tea to the audience, unexpectedly attracting countless customers. Every day, a long queue formed outside the tea pavilion very early, vying to buy small packets of tea and sample the boiled black tea. In just over ten days, more than 60,000 small packets of tea were sold. This was the most extensive introduction of Chinese tea to the Tunisian market and people, with many praising the long history and delicious taste of Chinese tea and welcoming Chinese tea to Tunisia.

The Tunisian people have a close friendship with the Chinese people, and they constantly mentioned in their conversations that the Bandung Conference resolutions have linked us all together. The chairman of the Tunisian-Chinese Friendship Association held a Chinese film evening for us, showing "The White-Haired Girl" and "The Chinese Acrobatic Troupe." The audience was very moved and satisfied, praising the rapid development of the Chinese film industry.

The people of independent Tunisia are engaged in diligent production and heroic struggle, continuing to strive for the complete eradication of imperialist forces. The French Avenue in Tunis has now been renamed Bourguiba Avenue. The Tunisians also have deep sympathy and support for the Algerian independence movement. In October of last year, Tunisian Prime Minister Bourguiba invited Moroccan Sultan Yusuf, Prime Minister Bekai, and five Algerian military leaders to Tunis to meet and discuss the establishment of the North African Union and Algerian independence. However, the shameless French military headquarters took the opportunity of the five Algerian military leaders taking a Moroccan plane piloted by the French, and hijacked them midway. When the Sultan of Morocco arrived in Tunis, many people lined the streets to welcome him; but they waited in vain for the Algerian military leaders to arrive, and it was not until the night of October 21 that they learned that they had been captured by the French army. When the news reached the Tunisian people, the trade union immediately convened an emergency meeting, deciding to hold a city-wide strike, demanding opposition to the French arrest of the five Algerian military leaders and demanding their immediate release. Workers and students in Tunis marched in demonstrations, opposing French imperialism. All stores were tightly closed, responding to the trade union's call for a market strike. Despite the threat of French tanks and the support of airplanes in the air, the Tunisian people's determination was firm, and the Tunisian government also announced the withdrawal of its ambassador to France, severing diplomatic relations with France.

Due to the long-term rule of colonialism, Tunisia's economy is backward. France still has a large influence in Tunisia's industry, mining, enterprises, agriculture, and commerce; but the Tunisian people are already building their new lives. Government officials told us that we are an independent country, and although the economy is backward, the people have the strength and determination to build their own country and completely drive out the colonialist forces.

	Morocco

On November 7, we left Tunis by plane and arrived in Casablanca, Morocco, on the east coast of the Atlantic Ocean. After the Second World War, a beautiful white high-rise building was newly built in Casablanca. The northern part of the city is the port on the Atlantic Ocean, which is large in scale and can berth forty large ships at the same time. Cranes and booms are like forests, and loading and unloading are done with modern equipment. This pier was built by the French colonists, and they plundered a lot of materials through this port.

It is said that in the fourteenth century, a Moroccan traveler visited Beijing, China, and wrote a book after returning to his country to introduce the situation in China. This was the first time in the historical relationship between the two countries. Later, Chinese tea was sold to the Moroccan market, and people there loved Chinese tea. The trade relationship has developed year by year. After the Japanese imperialists launched the war of aggression against China in 1937, Japan seized this tea market. It was not until the founding of New China that the market for Chinese green tea in Morocco was gradually restored.

During our stay in Morocco, tea merchants and other importers and exporters constantly came to us to discuss trade, especially the national merchants who were engaged in Chinese tea were more cordial with us. They reflected that Moroccans, regardless of men, women, old or young, regarded drinking tea as an indispensable thing. They especially like Chinese green tea, praising it for its excellent quality and fragrant aroma. More than a dozen tea merchants invited us to their homes to eat Arab meals. Whole roasted lamb, roasted chicken, and pancakes were placed on large plates, and everyone grabbed them with their hands, dipped in cinnamon salt and ate them, which had a unique flavor. Some hosts also personally served dishes, expressing their cordiality and friendship to Chinese friends. A few families also had Arab women come out to entertain, which was a particularly cordial and friendly expression, because Arab women generally do not receive guests.

One Sunday, we visited a farmer's family in the countryside. Respecting local customs, we took off our shoes when we entered the door, sat on the carpet in the room, and the host warmly greeted us by drinking three cups of tea in a row, and also introduced us to the local way of drinking tea. He said that tea has increased the friendship between the people of the two countries.

During our stay in Morocco, we also had extensive contact with officials, visited six major cities, met with the Prime Minister, Ministers and Mayors, and also met the Sultan. In their talks, they all said that China and Morocco had suffered from colonialists in the past and carried out anti-colonialist struggles. Now that both countries are independent and have begun to build their own countries, the resolutions of the Bandung Conference and the friendship of Asian and African countries have linked the people of the two countries together. The Mayor of Tangier said that China's support for Egypt and opposition to Britain and France is supporting our Arab countries. The Mayor of Casablanca mentioned that we are brotherly countries, and although the two countries are more than 10,000 miles apart, the hearts of the people are close. When we met the Sultan, he said to us in Arabic: "Today I am particularly pleased to meet the trade delegation of the People's Republic of China. Your visit is the first step in developing relations between the two countries. The spiritual connection between our two countries has already been established, and this time economic ties have been added." He expressed his admiration for the achievements of China's economic construction, and then talked about their efforts to consolidate political independence through economic independence, hoping to develop friendly relations between the two countries, and asked us to convey his greetings to Chairman Mao and the heads of government.

To celebrate the first anniversary of the Sultan's restoration, the Sultan held a military parade in Casablanca on November 18 last year. More than 17,000 people were reviewed, including infantry, cavalry, artillery, and tank soldiers. The liberation army in northern Morocco also participated in the formation of the review. Now there are about 30,000 troops in Morocco. From the review, we can see their anti-colonialist strength.

A small number of French troops are still entrenched in the port of Casablanca. In December last year, an American warship came, loaded with ammunition. The French army forced Moroccan workers to unload the ammunition, but the workers on the dock refused to unload the ammunition and said to the French army: "Now we are an independent country, we want peace, you cannot interfere." The workers persisted in the struggle for four days, and they just wouldn't unload the ammunition. Such struggles have happened constantly in the past, and from these actions, we deeply feel the enthusiasm of the Moroccan workers in the anti-colonialist struggle.

While visiting the port of Casablanca, some workers told us, "Morocco is an independent country, and now we are working hard to learn technology so that we can replace foreigners in the future."

	Libya

On December 29, we arrived in Tripoli, the capital of the Kingdom of Libya. Libya has an area of 1.76 million square kilometers, but the desert area accounts for two-thirds. Tripoli is on the south coast of the Mediterranean Sea, and it is a city that has been restored after the Second World War. Most of the city is composed of white buildings. Along the Mediterranean coast, there are still houses destroyed by British aircraft during the war. In the past, Tripoli City and Province were ruled by Italy, occupied by Britain after the war, and now the United States has also drilled in. The Libyan people have suffered from colonialists for a long time, and only formally became independent in 1952, but Britain and the United States still have military bases in Libya, and even interfere in internal affairs. The Libyan people constantly struggle against colonialists and demand peace. Many Libyans told us that Asian and African countries are close friends.

Libyan importers and exporters are very interested in China's silk, cloth, paper, glass, and daily necessities. Some expressed their willingness to act as agents for Chinese export companies. We met with government officials, and Prime Minister Halim received us. In addition to welcoming us to Libya, he also explained that China and Libya had many common points in the past and present. Libya sympathizes with China's support for Egypt. He expressed his hope to enhance friendly relations between the two countries.

During our visit to these three countries, I deeply felt the high anti-colonialist sentiments of the people of these countries and their friendship with the Chinese people. (Attached picture)

    北非访问的观感	中国国际贸易促进委员会	贸易访问团团长  齐维礼
    我们贸易访问团，应突尼斯第四届国际博览会的邀请，于1956年10月到达突尼斯，进行友好访问。博览会结束后，又到了摩洛哥、利比亚两个国家。这里，我愿向读者介绍一下我在北非访问得到的一些观感。
          突尼斯
    突尼斯第四届国际博览会于1956年10月13日至29日举行，参加展览的共有十六个国家。突尼斯也把自己的农业、工业、手工业、矿业等方面的产品展览出来了。在它的展览馆里，悬挂着鲜红的半月亮和五角星的国旗，显示出突尼斯独立后的新气象。参观博览会的共计四十二万人，较以往任何一届为多。
    我们在展览大厅中设立的问询处，每天来问事的人围成一团，不仅是来商谈贸易问题的进出口商，还有工人、农民、学生、妇女、青年来打听中国的建设情况：工人怎样提高技术；学生到中国来学习有些什么手续；中国文字的写法；中国青年在国家建设中的贡献……。用白布蒙着头、只露着两只眼睛的阿拉伯妇女，也来了解中国妇女穿什么衣服，中国妇女在家中地位如何。当他们提的问题得到了答复的时候，他们感到兴奋。
    中国茶叶出口公司委托一家朋友公司，在博览会中建筑了一座中国民族形式的茶叶馆，门口横写着“中国绿茶”四个大字。开幕那天，突尼斯首相布尔吉巴到中国茶叶馆来喝了一杯茶，他赞扬中国的茶叶气味香美。茶叶馆附设的卖品部向观众免费供应煮好的红茶，不想竟吸引来无数顾客。每天茶叶馆外边，很早就排好队，争着购买小包茶和试尝煮好的红茶。短短的十多天，销了六万多包小包茶。这是中国茶叶在突尼斯市场同人民见面最广的一次，许多人赞扬中国茶叶的历史悠久，味道美好，欢迎中国茶到突尼斯去。
    突尼斯人民对中国人民有着亲近的友情，他们谈话中不断提到，万隆会议的决议把我们大家联结在一起了。突中友好协会主席为我们举行了中国电影晚会，放映了“白毛女”和“中国杂技团”。观众非常感动和满意，他们赞扬中国电影事业的迅速发展。
    独立后的突尼斯人民，正在进行勤劳的生产和英勇的斗争，为彻底清除帝国主义势力而继续努力。突尼斯市的法国大街现已改成为布尔吉巴大街了。突尼斯人对于阿尔及利亚的独立运动，也寄予深深的同情和支持。去年10月突尼斯首相布尔吉巴曾邀请摩洛哥苏丹优素福、首相贝凯及阿尔及利亚五位军事领袖到突尼斯来开会，讨论建立北非联盟和阿尔及利亚独立等问题。但无耻的法国军事司令部，却趁阿尔及利亚五位军事领袖乘坐法国人驾驶的摩洛哥飞机之际，将他们中途劫走。摩洛哥苏丹到突尼斯时，许多人夹道欢迎他；但等阿尔及利亚军事领袖来，怎么也等不着了，到10月21日夜间，才知道他们已被法国军队捕去。当这个消息传到突尼斯人民中间的时候，工会立刻召开了紧急会议，确定全市罢工、罢商，提出反对法国逮捕阿尔及利亚五位军事领袖，要求立即释放他们。突尼斯市的工人、学生结队示威游行，反对法帝国主义。各商店紧闭着门，响应工会罢市的号召。尽管法国出动了坦克车进行威胁，并有飞机在空中助威，突尼斯的人民的斗志很坚决，突尼斯政府也宣布撤回它驻法国的大使，同法国断绝外交关系。
    由于殖民主义的长期统治，突尼斯的经济是落后的。法国在突尼斯的工矿、企业、农业和商业中，仍拥有较大的势力；但突尼斯人民已经在建设自己的新生活了。政府官员对我们说，我们是独立的国家，虽然经济落后，但人民有力量和决心建设好自己的国家，彻底赶走殖民主义势力。
          摩洛哥
    我们在11月7日，乘飞机离开突尼斯，到了大西洋东岸的摩洛哥的卡萨布兰卡市。卡萨布兰卡市在二次世界大战后新建立了一片美丽的白色高楼，市的北部就是大西洋边的港口，规模宏大，同时可以停泊大船四十艘。起重机、吊杆像树林一样，装卸都是使用近代化的设备。这个码头是法国殖民者建筑的，他们通过这港口，掠夺去了许多物资。
    据说在十四世纪的时候，有一位摩洛哥旅行家到过中国的北京，回国后写了一本书介绍中国情况，这是两国历史关系的第一次。后来中国茶叶销售到摩洛哥市场，那里的人很喜爱中国茶。贸易关系逐年发展，1937年日本帝国主义发动侵华战争后，日本夺去了这个茶叶市场，到新中国成立，才又逐步地恢复了中国绿茶在摩洛哥的市场。
    我们在摩洛哥期间，茶商和其他进出口商不断来找我们谈贸易，特别是经营中国茶叶的民族商和我们更亲切。他们反映摩洛哥人不分男女老幼都把喝茶当成不可少的东西了。他们特别喜欢中国绿茶，夸它品质优良，气味清香。有十多位茶商邀请我们到他们家中去吃阿拉伯饭。整个的烤羊、烤鸡、大饼放在大盘子里，大家用手抓着，沾上桂皮盐面吃，别有风味。也有主人亲自捧菜的，表示对中国朋友的亲切和友谊。还有少数家庭的阿拉伯妇女也出面来招待，这是特别亲切和友好的表示。因为阿拉伯妇女一般是不接见客人的。
    有一个星期天，我们到农村访问了一个农民家庭。尊重当地习惯，进门时脱了鞋子，走进房内地毯上坐下，主人热情地招待我们接连喝了三杯茶，还为我们介绍当地喝茶的方法。他说，茶叶增加了两国人民的友谊。
    在摩洛哥期间，我们和官方也进行了广泛接触，并参观了六个大城市，拜会了首相、部长和市长，还谒见了苏丹。他们在谈话中，都表示中国、摩洛哥两国过去同受殖民主义者的祸害，进行反殖民主义的斗争，现在两国都独立了，开始建设自己的国家，万隆会议的决议，亚非国家的友好，已把两国人民联在一起了。丹吉尔市长说，中国支持埃及，反对英、法，就是支持了我们阿拉伯国家。卡萨布兰卡市长提到我们是兄弟国家，两国虽然远离一万多里，但人民的心是近的。在我们谒见苏丹时，他用阿拉伯话对我们说：“今天接见中华人民共和国的贸易代表团感到特别愉快，你们的访问是发展两国关系的第一步，我们两国精神上的联系已经建立起来了，这次又加上经济上的联系。”他对中国经济建设的成就表示钦佩，接着谈到他们正在通过经济上的独立来巩固政治上的独立，希望发展两国的友好关系，并要我们转达对毛主席和政府各位首长的问候。
    为了庆祝苏丹复位的一周年，去年11月18日，苏丹在卡萨布兰卡市举行军事检阅。受检阅的有步兵、骑兵、炮兵、坦克兵等共一万七千多人，摩洛哥北部的解放军也参加了检阅的编队。现在摩洛哥的军队一共约有三万人。从检阅中可以看到他们反殖民主义的力量。
    在卡萨布兰卡港口，仍盘踞着少数法国军队。去年12月间，开来了一只美国军舰，上面装着军火。法国军队强迫摩洛哥工人卸军火，但码头上的工人拒绝卸这批军火，并向法国军队说：“现在我们是独立的国家，我们愿和平，你们不能干涉。”工人们坚持斗争了四天，就是不卸军火。这样的斗争过去也不断发生，我们从这些行动中，深深感受到摩洛哥工人反殖民主义斗争的热情。
    在参观卡萨布兰卡港时，有些工人告诉我们，“摩洛哥是独立的国家，现在我们正努力学习技术，以便将来代替外国人。”
            利比亚
    12月29日我们到达利比亚王国的首都的黎波里。利比亚的面积有一百七十六万平方公里，但沙漠地区就占了三分之二。的黎波里在地中海的南岸上，是第二次世界大战以后恢复起来的城市，市区大部分由白色的楼房组成。沿地中海边上仍有大战时被英国飞机炸毁的房屋。过去的黎波里市和省受意大利的统治，战后被英国侵占了，现在美国也钻了进来。利比亚人民长期受殖民主义者的祸害，1952年才正式独立，但英美在利比亚仍拥有军事基地，甚至还干涉着内政。利比亚的人民对殖民主义者不断地进行斗争，要求和平。许多利比亚人对我们说，亚非国家是亲密的朋友。
    利比亚的进出口商，对中国的绸缎、布匹、纸张、玻璃和日用百货等很感兴趣。有的表示愿给中国的出口公司代理。我们曾拜会了政府的官员，首相哈利姆接见我们，除了欢迎我们到利比亚外，还说明中国和利比亚过去和现在都有许多的共同点，利比亚同情中国支持埃及。他表示希望增进两国的友好关系。
    在这三个国家访问期间，我深刻的感到这些国家的人民反殖民主义情绪的高涨和对中国人民的友好。（附图片）
