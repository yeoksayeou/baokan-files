    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, March 25th: A Polish-Cambodian joint communiqué was signed on March 23rd by Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Cyrankiewicz, and Cambodian Prime Minister, San Yun.

    The communiqué stated that during the Polish government delegation’s visit to Cambodia, friendly exchanges of views were conducted with the Cambodian delegation on a number of issues of mutual concern to both countries. During these talks, the two delegations studied certain aspects of the international situation, as well as the issue of further consolidating friendly relations and commercial exchanges between the two countries.

    Both delegations expressed their belief in the necessity of continuing efforts to maintain world peace. Universal and supervised disarmament, as well as international cooperation in economic and cultural fields based on equality and mutual benefit and full respect for the principles of independence of all countries, large and small, can serve as means to achieve this goal.

    The communiqué believes that the policy of neutrality, increasingly adopted by Asian countries, is a necessary factor for world peace.

    The communiqué stated that the two governments believe that the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Cambodia has played a constructive role in consolidating peace.

    The communiqué stated that the two governments are satisfied to recognize that the political, economic, and cultural relations between Poland and Cambodia, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, have good prospects for development, and the two governments have decided to further strive to promote the broadest development of these relations.

    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 25th: The Polish government delegation, led by Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Cyrankiewicz, arrived in Delhi at 5:00 PM on March 24th, beginning their ten-day friendly visit to India.

    Welcoming them at the airport were Prime Minister Nehru and his daughter, Indira Gandhi, ministers and officials of the Indian government, prominent Indian social figures, and foreign diplomatic representatives.

    A large crowd at the airport cheered and greeted the Polish Prime Minister. A welcoming banner read: "We will cooperate for world peace."

    After reviewing the guard of honor, Cyrankiewicz delivered a speech saying: Poland and India are working together to strengthen peace, develop our countries, improve the living standards of our people, and ensure the safety of our people. He said that we are very happy to be able to see and learn from India's achievements.

    Nehru said that India's climate is hot. In order to welcome the Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers, the hearts of the Indian people are also warm. The Polish and Indian people need friendship and cooperation. He hopes to strengthen relations between the two countries.
