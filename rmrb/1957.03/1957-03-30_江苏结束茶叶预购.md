　  Jiangsu Ends Tea Pre-Purchasing
    (Our report) The Jiangsu Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in accordance with the state's unified procurement task requirements, and under the premise of implementing reduced tea picking, comprehensive seed retention, and benefiting tea tree growth and development, carried out the 1957 tea pre-purchasing work ahead of schedule. Currently, the province's pre-purchasing work has basically ended. According to statistics, more than 4,000 dan of raw tea have been pre-purchased in producing areas such as Zhenze, Wuxian, Yixing, Liyang, Jintan, and Jurong, including 3,390 dan of black tea, 147 dan of green tea, 251 dan of Biluochun tea, and 230 dan of wild mountain tea; more than 44,000 yuan in deposits have been issued.
    Through the pre-purchasing work, not only has it helped agricultural cooperatives solve the difficulties of lacking money and fertilizer in spring plowing production, but it has also encouraged the production enthusiasm of cooperative members.

　  江苏结束茶叶预购
    本报讯  江苏省供销合作社按照国家统一收购任务的要求，在实行少采茶叶，全面留种，以有利于茶树生长和发展的前提下，提早进行了1957年的茶叶预购工作，目前，全省预购工作已经基本结束。据统计，在震泽、吴县、宜兴、溧阳、金坛、句容等产地共预购毛茶四千多担，其中红茶三千三百九十担，绿茶一百四十七担，碧螺春二百五十一担，野山茶二百三十担；发放定金四万四千多元。
    通过预购工作，不仅帮助农业社解决了春耕生产中缺钱缺肥的困难，而且鼓舞了社员生产积极性。
