"Three Cooperatives" Meeting

In order to do a good job in this year's spring ploughing preparation, the Heng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Guangxi Province and the Party Committees of various districts successively convened "three cooperatives" representative meetings of supply and marketing cooperatives, agricultural cooperatives, and handicraft cooperatives in January. At the meetings, the supply and marketing cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives in various districts signed contracts for the supply of means of production with the agricultural cooperatives; they also adjusted the surpluses and shortages of means of production among the various agricultural cooperatives.

The "three cooperatives" representative meetings in various districts and the county of Heng County were all very successful, basically achieving mutual exchange of goods and direct contact between production and sales. For example, in the Cao Village District, seventeen agricultural cooperatives, including ten cooperatives, mutually adjusted 700,000 catties of sugarcane seeds and 1,250 catties of early corn seeds; seven agricultural cooperatives were linked to handicraft cooperatives, requesting the supply of more than 1,300 agricultural tools such as ploughshares; fourteen agricultural cooperatives signed supply contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives worth more than 29,000 yuan, requesting the supply of chemical fertilizers, "666" pesticide powder, sprayers, new-style walking plows and other agricultural tools. Through the county meeting, the surpluses and shortages between the agricultural cooperatives in various districts were further adjusted. The supply and marketing cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives also further determined their production and sales plans through the meeting.

Judging from the effect of the "three cooperatives" meeting held in Heng County, Guangxi, this is indeed a good method worth learning. This method not only centrally solves the problem of means of production urgently needed for spring ploughing, determines the purchase and sales plans of the supply and marketing cooperatives, arranges the production of handicraft cooperatives, and closely combines the three around the central task of striving for a comprehensive and bumper harvest in agriculture this year; more importantly, it strengthens the friendly cooperation between the agricultural cooperatives and the collaboration between the production and sales departments.

    “三社”会议
    广西省中共横县县委和各区党委，为了做好今年的春季备耕工作，在1月间先后召开了供销社、农业社和手工业社的“三社”代表会议。在会议上，各区的供销社、手工业社同农业社签订了生产资料的供应合同；同时也调剂了各农业社之间生产资料的余缺。
    横县各区的和县的“三社”代表会议都开得很好，基本上做到了互通有无，产销见面。例如曹村区的十七个农业社，其中有十个社互相调剂了甘蔗种七十万斤，早玉米种一千二百五十斤；有七个农业社同手工业社挂了钩，要求供应犁口等农具一千三百多件；有十四个农业社同供销社签订了总值二万九千多元的供应合同，要求供应化学肥料、“六六六”药粉、喷雾器、新式步犁等农具。通过县的会议，又进一步调剂了各区农业社之间的余缺。供销社和手工业社也通过会议进一步确定了自己的产销计划。
    从广西横县举办“三社”会议的效果来看，这确实是一种值得学习的好办法。这种办法不但集中地解决了春耕生产所急需的生产资料问题，确定了供销社的购销计划，安排了手工业社的生产，把三者紧密地结合在争取今年农业全面大丰收这一中心任务的周围；更重要的是，加强了各农业社之间的友好合作和各产销部门之间的协作。
