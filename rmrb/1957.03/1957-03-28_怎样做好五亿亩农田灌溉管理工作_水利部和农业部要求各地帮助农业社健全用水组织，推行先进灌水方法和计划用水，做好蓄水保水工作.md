Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The Ministry of Water Resources and the Ministry of Agriculture jointly issued instructions today, requiring all localities to do a good job in irrigation management to strive for a bumper harvest this year.

The instructions stated: At present, the national irrigation area has developed to 500 million mu, which is an important condition for increasing agricultural production. Doing a good job in the management of existing irrigation facilities, fully realizing irrigation benefits, ensuring the completion and over-completion of agricultural production plans, and obtaining a bumper harvest are the common important tasks of the agricultural and water resources departments.

The instructions require all localities to:

(1)　Resolutely rely on and assist agricultural cooperatives in improving water use organizations and doing a good job in water use management. First of all, all localities must comprehensively and effectively manage existing irrigation facilities according to the scale and type of the projects, and adopt appropriate forms. Agricultural cooperatives should establish water conservancy management organizations, appoint special personnel to be responsible for leadership, and formulate necessary systems to eliminate the phenomenon of no management. Secondly, it is necessary to actively help agricultural cooperatives train water conservancy technicians; fix irrigators in their positions to enhance their enthusiasm and technical capabilities.

(2)　Vigorously improve irrigation technology and promote advanced irrigation methods. Practice has proven that furrow irrigation and ridge irrigation for dryland crops, and rational, frequent, and shallow irrigation for rice are good methods for increasing production and can prevent the rise of salt in saline-alkali land. In this year's irrigation management work, all localities should take improving irrigation technology as an important task; at the same time, they should also pay attention to summarizing the people's water use experience and promote it locally.

(3)　Actively promote planned water use. The development of agricultural cooperativization has brought more favorable conditions for expanding the implementation of planned water use. All localities should, based on possible conditions, expand the scope of planned water use as much as possible, especially in arid areas where it should be implemented first. Areas that did not implement planned water use last year should actively focus on trial implementation this year to create conditions for widespread development. Agricultural cooperatives in irrigation areas should incorporate water use plans into production plans, coordinate labor arrangements, and use water on time.

(4)　Fully do a good job in water storage and conservation. Dry and leaky ponds should be inspected and repaired as early as possible; for all water storage and irrigation facilities, attention should be paid to developing water sources and improving water storage and drought resistance capabilities. At the same time, effective measures should be taken to use water reasonably and strengthen field water conservation work.

　　怎样做好五亿亩农田灌溉管理工作
　　水利部和农业部要求各地帮助农业社健全用水组织，推行先进灌水方法和计划用水，做好蓄水保水工作
    新华社26日讯　水利部和农业部今天联合发布指示，要求各地做好灌溉管理工作，争取今年农业大丰收。
    指示说：目前全国灌溉面积已发展到五亿亩，是农业增产的重要条件。做好已有灌溉设施的管理工作，全面地发挥灌溉效益，保证农业生产计划的完成与超额完成，获得农业的大丰收，是农业、水利部门共同的重要任务。
    指示要求各地：
      （一）切实依靠和帮助农业社健全用水组织，做好用水管理工作。各地首先要把现有灌溉设施，根据工程规模及类型，采取适当形式全面切实管理起来。农业社里应该建立水利管理组织，设立专人负责领导，制定必要制度，消灭无人管理现象。其次，要积极帮助农业社培养水利技术人员；把灌水员固定起来，提高他们的积极性和技术能力。
      （二）大力提高灌溉技术，推行先进的灌溉方法。实践证明，旱作物的沟灌、畦灌，水稻的合理勤浇浅灌是增产的好办法，并能防止盐碱地盐份的上升。各地在今年的灌溉管理工作中，应该把改进灌溉技术作为一项重要任务；同时还要注意总结群众用水经验，就地推广。
      （三）积极推行计划用水。农业合作化的发展给扩大推行计划用水带来了更优越的条件。各地应根据可能条件，尽量扩大计划用水实施范围，特别是在干旱地区更应尽先实行。去年没有实行计划用水的地区，今年要积极重点试办，为广泛开展创造条件。灌区农业社应该把用水计划纳入生产计划，统一安排劳力，按时用水。
      （四）充分做好蓄水保水工作。对一些干塘漏塘，应该及早进行检查整修；对所有蓄水灌溉设施，都要注意开辟水源，提高蓄水抗旱能力。同时采取有效措施，合理用水，加强田间保水工作。
