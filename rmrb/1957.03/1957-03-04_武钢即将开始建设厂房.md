Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 3rd. Han Ningfu, Deputy General Manager of Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Corporation, said to more than 300 advanced production (work) personnel on the Wuhan Steel construction site on the 1st that this year, Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise will shift from construction preparation to factory construction. The projects of the joint enterprise's five systems, including the refractory materials plant, coking plant, sintering plant, ore dressing plant, and the No. 1 blast furnace of the ironmaking plant, will all commence construction this year.

He said that before this year, we had carried out construction preparation work for Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise in all aspects, and also started the construction of Daye Iron Mine and Wuhan Thermal Power Plant. The construction engineering tasks we are undertaking in 1957 have increased by nearly double compared to 1956.

Han Ningfu said that the state has very strict quality requirements for the construction project of Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise, requiring the acceleration of the construction of the No. 1 blast furnace, early iron production, and also requiring more reduction in project costs and improvement of labor productivity, building Wuhan Steel industriously and thriftily. He encouraged advanced producers to prevent complacency, work hard, lead all employees, and strive for savings, speed, and safety on the basis of ensuring the quality of construction projects. He called on every builder to save building materials bit by bit at all times, and to cherish building materials as if they cherish their own eyes.

    武钢即将开始建设厂房
    新华社武汉3日电  武汉冶金建筑总公司副总经理韩宁夫，1日对武钢工地上的三百多名先进生产（工作）者说，今年，武汉钢铁联合企业将由施工准备转为厂房建设。联合企业的耐火材料厂、炼焦化工厂、烧结厂、选矿厂和炼铁厂一号高炉等五个系统的工程，都将在今年先后动工兴建。
    他说，今年以前，我们从各方面进行了武汉钢铁联合企业的施工准备工作，还开始了大冶铁矿和武汉热电厂的建设。1957年我们担负的建筑工程任务，比1956年增加了将近一倍。
    韩宁夫说，国家对武汉钢铁联合企业建设工程的质量要求十分严格，要求一号高炉加速建设，提前出铁，而且要求更多地降低工程成本和提高劳动生产率，勤俭建设武钢。他勉励先进生产者防止骄傲自满，艰苦奋斗，带动全体职工，在保证建设工程质量的基础上求省求快求安全。他号召每个建设者每时每刻要一点一滴地节约建筑材料，像爱护自己眼睛一样地去珍惜建筑材料。
