    Publication of "Excavated Relics from the Tomb of the Marquis of Cai in Shou County"

    The book "Excavated Relics from the Tomb of the Marquis of Cai in Shou County," which has attracted widespread attention from archaeological circles in China, has been published by the Science Press.

    The tomb of the Marquis of Cai in Shou County was discovered during the Huai River harnessing project in 1955. The State of Cai was a small state during the Spring and Autumn period, situated between the two major powers of Wu and Chu. It once depended on the State of Chu and later on the State of Wu. Shou County was "Zhoulai" during the Spring and Autumn period, the location of the State of Cai. The State of Cai was destroyed by Chu at the end of the Spring and Autumn period. The identity of the Marquis of Cai is currently a matter of debate among archaeologists.

    The relics excavated from the tomb of the Marquis of Cai include 584 items of bronzes, jades, bone artifacts, lacquerware, and gold leaf. Among them, bronzes are the most numerous, totaling 486 pieces, making it a remarkable discovery in the archaeological field since liberation. These include complete sets of ritual objects, groups of musical instruments, and a large number of chariots, horses, and weapons, all exquisitely crafted and decorated with magnificent patterns. These relics are of great reference value for studying ancient bronzes, resolving the names of ancient artifacts, understanding the material culture of the late Spring and Autumn and early Warring States periods, as well as the relationship between the States of Wu and Chu.

    The newly published "Excavated Relics from the Tomb of the Marquis of Cai in Shou County" describes the discovery and excavation of the tomb of the Marquis of Cai, the layout of the tomb, and provides a systematic and detailed description of the unearthed relics with extensive coverage. The book includes clear copperplate illustrations and rubbings of patterns and inscriptions on the relics.

    “寿县蔡侯墓出土遗物”出版
    引起国内考古学界广泛注意的“寿县蔡侯墓出土遗物”一书，已由科学出版社出版。
    寿县蔡侯墓是在1955年治淮工程中发现的。蔡为春秋时的一个小国，处在吴、楚两大国之间。曾依附楚国，后又依附吴国。寿县是春秋时的“州来”，为蔡国所在地。蔡国在春秋末被楚所灭。蔡侯究为何人，目前考古学家的意见还未一致。
    蔡侯墓中所发掘的遗物，有铜器、玉器、骨器、漆器、金叶等五百八十四件，其中以铜器最多，共四百八十六件，是解放以来考古事业上一次精采的发现。其中有成套的礼品，成组的乐器、大批的车马兵器，都是制作精美，花纹瑰丽。这些遗物对研究古代的铜器，解决古代器物的名称，了解春秋末期和战国初期的物质文化状况，以及吴楚等国的关系，具有重大的参考价值。
    新出版的“寿县蔡侯墓出土遗物”一书，叙述了蔡侯墓的发现、发掘经过和墓葬的形制，并以大量篇幅对出土遗物作了系统详细的描述。书中附有清晰的铜版制图和遗物上花纹和铭文的拓本。
