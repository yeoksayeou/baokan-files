How Can a Small City Carry Out the Work of the CPPCC?
Yang Shen-si Introduces the Work Experience of the CPPCC Huzhou Municipal Committee

The Huzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in Zhejiang Province was established in February 1956 and officially began operations in March. It has been less than a year. At the beginning of its establishment, we had no experience and were proceeding entirely by trial and error. After several setbacks and efforts, we finally found a bit of a path. Currently, we are proceeding along this exploratory path. Of course, we still need to explore and continue to progress through exploration. I would like to share the experiences of this past year for the reference of CPPCC workers in small cities across the country like Huzhou. I also welcome your corrections!

	I. Specific Situation

Huzhou is a small city with a population of only over 65,000. However, its natural environment is very favorable, with mountains, rivers, lakes, and plains near the city. It is rich in local products, and Huzhou mulberry, silk, brocade, and writing brushes are famous throughout the country. Before liberation, agricultural and sideline products from the surrounding counties were sold to Shanghai, Suzhou, and other places through this city, making it a commercial hub. However, after long-term exploitation by the reactionary ruling class and eight years of occupation during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the people were in dire straits on the eve of liberation. Huzhou is also the hometown of the Chen brothers (referring to Chen Guofu and Chen Lifu, leaders of the Kuomintang's CC Clique). According to the investigation at the time, there were more than ten members of the Kuomintang Central Committee in Huzhou alone during the Kuomintang reactionary rule. Therefore, class relations were very complex, and ideological conditions were extremely abnormal. After liberation, although the people's ideological awareness has been significantly improved through continuous education and transformation by the Party and the government, as well as a series of movements such as land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the Five-Anti Campaign, the Three-Anti Campaign, and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, before the establishment of the CPPCC, people were not familiar with the term "united front" and even mistakenly regarded the United Front Work Department as an armed force. It was not until the establishment of the CPPCC that this view changed, and people began to understand the work of the CPPCC. We have a total of only three staff members. When we need to conduct activities or go out for in-depth understanding, we all go out. When there are large gatherings or activities, we strive to obtain the assistance of cadres from various organizations and social figures to properly coordinate and successfully complete the work. Our funding is also limited. We are able to mobilize positive factors from all aspects with limited manpower and resources to assist the Party and the government in successfully completing our work.

	II. Small Gains

1. We are able to conduct political consultation work regularly.

In the past year, we have held two plenary sessions and eight standing committee meetings. Their content, such as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the distribution of profits of private industrial and commercial enterprises, the issue of fixed interest rates, the arrangement of junior and senior primary school graduates, the issue of united front work, the issue of peaceful liberation of Taiwan, the issue of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, the issue of increasing production and practicing economy, the issue of the supply of non-staple foods during the Spring Festival in the city, etc., have been continuously changed and carried out according to the requirements at the time. Whenever implementing policies, we must repeatedly consult with relevant sectors to achieve ideological unity. For example, during the election of the Second Municipal People's Congress, the number of representatives and the list of candidates must be repeatedly consulted from bottom to top and from top to bottom. In particular, the nomination of the mayor, deputy mayor, and candidates for the Municipal People's Committee was discussed in detail more than six times, carefully considered, and opinions from all aspects were gathered before being submitted to the congress for a vote. Therefore, after the election, the people of the city unanimously expressed satisfaction.

Consultation also fully promotes the spirit of democratic centralism, combines opinions from all aspects, and considers objective conditions. For example, on the issue of intellectuals, after absorbing opinions from all aspects, we reorganized and planned, drafted a draft plan, distributed it to all parties for discussion and revision, and then finalized it. After implementation, it greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of intellectuals. Experienced teachers in schools use the method of mentoring to be responsible for cultivating young teachers. Some older teachers, although they feel that they have insufficient energy, still strive to teach more hours and never complain. For example, on the issue of market supply during the Spring Festival, some goods in the market showed a tense state at that time. After consultation, the people of the city learned about the government's various measures and all reflected that our government is indeed serving the people. How could the reactionary governments before liberation care about our lives!

2. Political activities and daily work

Our political activities are diverse. Some hold forums for various sectors, some hold large-scale city-wide gatherings, some conduct very detailed and in-depth individual visits, and some conduct heart-to-heart talks and get-togethers. They are flexibly applied anytime and anywhere. For example, on the issue of the Suez Canal in Egypt, we held a city-wide gathering of people from all walks of life. On the eve of the "Eighth National Congress," we also held a city-wide celebration, which achieved a certain effect in strengthening the ideological education of the people of the city. For example, on the issue of the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, in addition to holding forums for various sectors, social figures also conducted individual visits to the families of Kuomintang personnel in the city, explaining the government's policies in detail, cordially talking to them, and comforting them. We also invited them to participate in our get-togethers during the Spring Festival and the Lunar New Year's Day to make them feel that the country treats them the same as ordinary people and dispel their ideological concerns.

Daily work is divided into two types: studying current affairs and policies, and collecting mass opinions. The study of current affairs and policies is carried out by the Industrial and Commercial Circles Learning Committee, the Industrial and Commercial Circles Youth Learning Committee, the Industrial and Commercial Circles Family Learning Committee, the Medical Circles Learning Committee, the Religious Circles Learning Committee, and the Social Figures Learning Group under the CPPCC Municipal Learning Committee. Its content mainly includes current affairs and policies. More than 1,000 people participated in the study. We proceeded according to the three-self principle, but we also used various methods to prevent self-sufficiency. The industrial and commercial circles also have political training classes for full-time study, which are also led by the CPPCC. After the study, great changes have taken place in their thinking. Especially for older social figures, after liberation, they thought they were old and useless and had a feeling of being independent from the world. After the study, they realized the relationship between individuals and the country and realized the beautiful scenery of the socialist future. An 77-year-old Mr. Chen Guiqing said that he should remove 60 years and only leave 17 years to work hard for socialist construction. An 85-year-old Mr. Zhou Sancheng also came to participate in our study. When they talked about the oppression they suffered from the reactionary government in the past and the contrast between the old and the new, they often burst into tears.

We have also formulated a method of collecting and reflecting mass opinions. The units, democratic parties, people's organizations, committee members, and working groups of the CPPCC are responsible for regularly collecting and reflecting mass opinions, suggestions, and requirements and submitting them to the Party and the government. In the past two months, there have been more than 150 cases. Every case has been answered, and the masses are satisfied.

The CPPCC has also established six working groups under the Standing Committee: culture and education, industry and commerce, medical and health, science and technology, religion, and social liaison. They are composed of committee members of the CPPCC and representative figures from outside the CPPCC, with a total of 87 people. Its tasks are to convey government policies and decrees, consult on measures related to policies, collect and reflect mass opinions, play a bridge role between the masses and the Party and the government, and mobilize positive factors from all aspects. The working groups have made great gains on issues such as the relationship between the Party and non-Party members, the unity of new and old teachers, and the unity of Chinese and Western medicine.

III. Expansion and Consolidation of the United Front

After a year of efforts, our united front has gradually expanded to various sectors. The CPPCC Committee initially had only 59 members, but now it has expanded to 76 members. Among them are senior intellectuals, famous actors, advanced producers, technicians, farmers, engineers, and elderly old intellectuals. All representative figures have participated in the CPPCC Municipal Committee as members of the committee or members of the working group. Intellectuals, due to the effective implementation of the policy on intellectuals, whether they are technical personnel in factories or new and old teachers in schools, everyone feels that the leadership treats them too favorably and has a feeling of being overwhelmed by favor. Naturally, they feel grateful and want to repay the favor, and they are all working selflessly. Recently, the middle schools in Huzhou held an exhibition of teaching aids made by teachers themselves, and the richness of its materials is unprecedented.

In terms of industry and commerce, after learning, they clarified the future of the national bourgeoisie. At present, all 89 private industrial enterprises and 965 private stores in the city have implemented joint state-private ownership or participated in cooperatives. In the future, the transition from the first stage of state capitalism to the second stage of socialist ownership can naturally proceed successfully.

Social figures have experienced a longer period in the old society and have been more deeply stimulated. Moreover, they have a certain level of education and are more receptive. After learning, some people have already changed their original faces. We also conducted serial visits to social figures scattered in various sectors, talking about current affairs and policies and the contrast between the old and the new from daily life, arousing their love for the motherland and their trust in the Party and the government. After several visits, many social figures have requested to participate in our study. Some elderly people who cannot go out also asked us to talk to them often. Relatives of overseas Chinese and families of Kuomintang personnel are also closely contacted through social figures. We also continue to help the religious community solve problems. Recently, various democratic parties have successively established organizations in Huzhou, and we have also tried our best to assist them.

The above-mentioned gains are of course inseparable from the active support of the Party and the government and the strong assistance of various organs and organizations. Without the support of the Party and the government, or without the assistance of organs and organizations, even if we used all our strength, there would be no hope of success.

IV. Several Experiences

1. Gaining the attention of the CPC Committee is the primary key to carrying out the work of the CPPCC. Judging from the current situation, the Huzhou Municipal CPC Committee attaches great importance to the work of the CPPCC. The secretary of the CPC Committee attends and presides over the CPPCC's consultation and discussion of major issues. Relevant responsible comrades from various committees also participate in various meetings. Moreover, they provide great support for the work of the CPPCC, which has a great effect on the development of the work of the CPPCC. However, the CPPCC itself must also be good at formulating its own plans in accordance with the central work of the Party and the government in various periods. It must serve the central work and assist in promoting the central work. It must also give play to the subjective initiative of its work and strengthen the planning of its work. Only in this way can the work be active.

2. Political consultation must be conducted on the basis of fully developing democracy and extensively collecting mass opinions. It must start from going deep into the masses to understand the masses. After understanding the ideological conditions of the masses, and then prescribing the right medicine according to this kind of thinking, the harvest will naturally be great. When holding forums, it is especially necessary to speak with substance and be able to say heartfelt words in order to achieve ideological understanding and solve problems. We have achieved great results in holding forums on the issue of intellectuals, forums on the unity of Chinese and Western medicine, and forums on the issue of the relationship between public and private in the industrial and commercial circles because we have made full preparations beforehand.

3. When holding forums, in addition to widely absorbing representative personnel to participate, we also invite responsible personnel from relevant departments to participate, so that the masses can understand the government's policies, and the responsible personnel of relevant departments can listen to the opinions of the masses, and achieve reasonable solutions through open and honest consultation. For example, we have gained this kind of experience in holding forums on the issue of completing the 1956 plan for joint state-private industrial enterprises and forums on the issue of supplying non-staple foods during the Spring Festival in 1956.

4. Whether it is a forum or a collection of mass opinions, we must first fully analyze and study it. Send it to relevant departments for processing. For anything that can be done, delayed, or cannot be done, relevant departments must respond in a timely manner, so as to give play to the enthusiasm of the masses and closely unite around the Party and the government.

V. Several Issues

1. Our work certainly has some achievements, more or less. However, there are still many problems. Our understanding of the masses is not deep enough, and the scope of unity is not wide enough. We are still prone to making subjectivist errors. In the future, we must overcome this shortcoming, and we must make greater efforts to further go deep into the masses, understand the masses, and further expand the scope of unity, so as to make the work more perfect.

2. In our work, we can encounter difficulties at any time. But we can gradually solve them. What cannot be solved at present is that some people in the elderly social figures are living in extreme difficulties. Although the government has given them appropriate relief, they do not need relief; they need work. However, limited by conditions, it is currently impossible to solve. This is also a social problem.

In short, the Huzhou Municipal Committee of the CPPCC has made some achievements in the past year, but there are still many problems. We have the confidence and strength to make every effort to improve the united front work with the active support of the Party and the government and the assistance of various democratic parties and organizations, and we must give greater play to the policy of unity, education, and transformation and promote it to all sectors of the city. We must unite more than 60,000 people in the city as a whole and unite around the Party to work hard for socialist transformation and socialist construction. (Attached photo)

    小城市怎样开展政协的工作
    杨莘耜介绍政协湖州市委会工作经验
    政协浙江省湖州市委员会，是在1956年2月间成立的，到3月间才正式开始办公，到现在为止，还不满一年的时间。成立之初，我们是毫无经验，完全在摸索中进行，几经挫折、几经努力，才得到一点门径。目前正沿着这摸索着的门径进行，当然我们还要摸索，还要在摸索中不断进行。我想在这里把这一年光景的经过情况说一说，以供全国同我们湖州一样小城市办政协工作者的参考。并求指正！
        一、具体情况
    湖州是一个小城市。全市人口只有六万五千多人；自然环境却非常优越，市区附近有山有水、有湖泊、有平原，土特产丰富，湖桑、湖丝、湖绸、湖笔，是全国闻名的。四周邻县的农业副产品在解放以前，都通过本市投售于上海、苏州等处，确是一个商业市场的聚散点。但经过反动统治阶级的长期剥削，又经过抗日战争中的八年沦陷，在解放前夕已经搞得民不聊生。湖州又是二陈的老家，根据当时的调查，国民党反动派统治时期，仅湖州一隅之地，国民党中央委员有十个人以上之多。因此阶级关系非常复杂，思想情况也极不正常。解放以后，虽然经过党和政府的不断教育和改造，经过一系列的土改、镇反、五反、三反、抗美援朝等等运动，人民的思想觉悟，已有显著的提高。但在政协成立之前，人民对统一战线这个名称，还不够熟悉，甚至误认统战部为武装部队的。到了政协成立以后，才改变了这种观点，才对政协工作有所认识。我们的工作人员，一共只有三个人，如果遇到有所活动，或须出去深入了解的时候，我们就全部出发。遇有大集会大活动的时候，我们就争取各团体各机关的干部以及社会人士的协助适当地配合，把这工作满意地搞好。我们的经费，也有一定的限制。我们是能够以有限的人力、物力，调动各方面的积极因素协助党和政府很好地完成我们的工作。
        二、点滴收获
    1、政治协商工作，我们是能够经常进行的。
    一年之中我们开过全会两次、常会八次。它的内容，如镇压反革命分子问题、私营工商业盈余分配问题、定息问题、初中高小毕业生安排问题、统一战线工作问题、和平解放台湾问题、百花齐放百家争鸣问题、增产节约问题、市内春节副食品供应问题等等，都按着当时的要求，不断的改变和进行。凡遇贯彻政策的时候，我们必须与有关阶层进行反复协商，以求思想上的一致。例如市二届人民代表选举的时候，代表的名额和候选人名单，必须经过由下而上、由上而下的反复协商。尤其是市长副市长，以及市人委候选人员的拟定，经过六次以上详细讨论，慎重考虑，集合各方面的意见，然后提请大会投票选举。因此在选举以后全市人民都一致认为满意。
    协商又充分发扬民主集中的精神，汇合各方面的意见，并考虑到客观的条件。例如知识分子问题，在吸收各方面意见之后，再加以整理规划，拟定了方案草案，发交各方面讨论修正，再行定案。实施以后，大大地鼓舞了知识分子的积极性，学校中有经验的教师都用带徒弟的办法，负责培养青年教师。有些年老的教师虽然觉得有些精力不够，但还要争取多教钟点，决不叫苦。又如春节市场供应问题，当时市场上某些物品呈现了紧张的状态。经过协商以后，全市人民知道了政府各种措施，都反映说：我们的政府的确是为人民服务的。解放以前的反动政府那里来管我们的死活呢！
    2、政治活动和日常工作
    政治活动我们是多种多样的，有的举行各个阶层的座谈会，有的举行全市性的大规模的集会，有的进行很细致很深入的个别访问，有的进行谈心会和联欢会。随时随处灵活应用。例如埃及苏伊士运河问题，我们举行了全市性各界人士的集会；
  “八大”召开前夕，我们也举行了全市性的庆祝大会；在加强全市人民思想教育方面，取得了一定的效果。又如和平解放台湾问题，我们除召开各个阶层的座谈会外，并由社会人士分向全市蒋方人员家属进行个别访问，详细说明政府的政策，恳切交谈、慰问他们，并在春节和旧历元宵邀请他们参加我们的联欢会。务使他们感觉到国家对他们和一般人民一样看待，解除他们的思想顾虑。
    日常工作分时事政策学习和搜集群众意见两种。时事政策学习，是由政协市学委会下的工商界学委会、工商界青年学委会、工商界家属学委会、医务界学委会、宗教界学委会和社会人士学习小组负责进行的。它的内容主要是时事政策。参加学习的一共有一千多人，我们是根据三自原则进行的，但也用种种方法，防止自流。工商界另有政治讲习班，脱产学习，也由政协领导。经过学习之后，思想上均发生了极大的变化。尤其是年老的社会人士，解放以后，他们自以为年纪老了、于世无补，都有遗世独立的感觉，他们经过学习之后，才知道个人与国家的关系，才知道社会主义前途的美景。有一位七十七岁陈桂青老先生，他说：他应该除去六十岁只剩十七岁，要为社会主义建设而努力。还有一位八十五岁周三成老先生，也来参加我们的学习。他们谈到过去受反动政府压迫的情形，谈到新旧的对比，往往声泪俱下。
    我们还规定一种搜集和反映群众意见的办法，由参加本会各单位、各民主党派、各人民团体、本会委员、本会各工作组及其成员，负责经常搜集和反映群众意见、建议和要求，向党和政府提出。两个月以来，一共有一百五十多件。件件都得到答复，群众都认为满意。
    本会又在常委之下设立了文教、工商、医务卫生、科技、宗教、社会联系六个工作组，由本会委员和会外有代表性的人员组成，一共有八十七人。它的任务是：传达政府的政策和法令、协商有关政策的措施、搜集和反映群众的意见、在群众与党和政府之间起了桥梁作用，并调动了各方面的积极作用，在党与非党的关系问题上、在新老教师团结问题上、在中西医团结问题上，工作组的收获都很大。
    三、团结面的扩大和巩固
    经过一年来的努力，我们的团结面，已经逐渐的扩大，扩大到各个阶层里去。本会委员最初只五十九人，现在已扩大到七十六人。其中有高级知识分子、有名演员、有先进生产者、有技术工人、有农民、有工程师、有年老的旧知识分子，凡是有代表性的人士都参加了政协市委会，为本会委员或工作组的成员。知识分子，由于知识分子政策的切实执行，无论工厂方面技术人员也好和学校方面的新老教师也好，大家都感觉到领导上对他们过于优待，有受宠若惊的感觉，自然发生感激图报的心情，都在忘我的劳动。最近湖州各中学开了一个教师自制教具的展览会，其材料的丰富实为从来所未有。
    工商业方面，通过学习之后，明确了民族资产阶级的前途，目前全市八十九户私营工业企业和九百六十五户私营商店已全部实行了公私合营或参加合作社，将来由第一阶段的国家资本主义所有制改为第二阶段的社会主义所有制，自然可以胜利进行。
    社会人士，在旧社会经过时间较长，所受的刺激也较深。并且他们有一定的文化水平，接受也比较容易。经过学习之后，有些人已经改变本来的面貌。我们并举行了联串访问，访问散处在各阶层的社会人士，从日常生活之中，谈到时事政策，谈到新旧对比，引起他们对祖国的热爱，对党和政府的信任。经过几次访问之后有许多社会人士，都要求参加我们的学习。有些年纪老的不能出门的，并要求我们常常去和他们谈谈。侨眷和蒋方人员的家属，也通过社会人士，加以密切联系；宗教界方面，我们也不断帮助他们解决问题。最近各民主党派在湖州先后建立组织，我们也尽力加以协助。
    以上所举的几点收获，当然与党和政府的积极支持和各机关团体的极力协助分不开的。如果没有党和政府的支持，或者没有机关团体的协助，即使用尽我们的力量，也没有成功的希望。
        四、几点经验
      1、争取中共党委的重视，是开展政协工作的首要关键。照现在情况来看，湖州市中共党委对政协工作是极为重视的。政协协商讨论重大问题，党委书记都出席主持。各种会议党委各有关负责同志，也都来参加。而且对政协工作都有很大的支持，这对政协工作的开展有很大的作用。但政协本身，也必须善于按照党政各个时期的中心工作来订出自己的计划。为中心工作服务，协助推动中心工作。本身也必须发挥主观的工作能动性，加强工作计划性。这样才能使工作活跃。
    2、政治协商，必须在充分发扬民主和广泛搜集群众意见的基础上进行，必须先从深入群众了解群众入手。在了解了群众的思想情况之后，然后针对这种思想对症下药，收获自然很大。开座谈会时，尤须言之有物，能够说腹心话，才可以做到思想见面，解决问题。我们在举行知识分子问题座谈会、中西医团结问题座谈会、工商界公私关系问题座谈会等等，事前都做好充分的准备，就收到很大的效果。
      3、举行座谈会，我们除去广泛吸收有代表性人员参加之外，并请有关部门负责人员参加，务使群众能够了解政府的政策，有关部门负责人员，能够听取群众的意见，在开诚布公商量之中，得到合理的解决。例如我们在举行公私合营工业企业完成1956年计划问题座谈会、1956年春节副食品供应问题座谈会等等，都有了此种经验。
      4、无论座谈会也好，搜集到的群众意见书也好，我们必须先加以充分分析研究。送请有关部门处理。凡是能办、缓办、或不能办的，必须由有关部门及时答复，这样才能发挥群众的积极性，紧密地团结在党和政府的周围。
        五、几个问题
    1、我们的工作，肯定是或多或少有些成绩的。但存在的问题还是不少，对了解群众还不够深入、团结面还不够广泛，我们还很容易犯主观主义的错误。今后我们必须克服这种缺点，必须再尽更大的努力，进一步深入群众、了解群众，进一步扩大团结面，使工作更能完善。
    2、我们在工作中，是时时可以遇到困难的。但我们可以渐次加以解决。目前还无法解决的，在年老的社会人士中，有些人生活极为困难，虽然已由政府加以适当的救济，但是他们并不需要救济；需要工作，限于条件，目前还无法解决。这也是一个社会问题。
    总之政协湖州市委会，在一年光景时间之中，是有些成绩的，但存在的问题还是不少。我们是有信心、有力量，在党和政府的积极支持之下，在各民主党派和各机关团体的协助之下，我们一定要尽我们的力量，把统一战线工作搞好，一定要把团结、教育、改造的方针，发挥更大的效力，推动到全市各个阶层里去，要把全市六万多人团结为一个整体，团结在党的周围为社会主义改造、社会主义建设而努力。（附图片）
