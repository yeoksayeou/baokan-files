I am participating in the Third Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference with excitement. In the days before the meeting, I was honored to participate in our country's Supreme State Conference, which I never dreamed of. At the meeting, I heard Chairman Mao's instructions on the correct handling of contradictions among the people and the twelve points, Premier Zhou's report on his friendly visit to eleven countries, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of the Second Five-Year Plan and instructions on increasing production and practicing economy, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC. I fully agree with and support them, which gave me great encouragement and inspiration.

Now I want to talk about how to do a better job in increasing production and practicing economy within our enterprises, accumulate more funds for the country, and accelerate the speed of industrial construction. People in industrial construction must be careful and calculating, adhering to the spirit of the central government's instructions, building the country through diligence and thrift, running enterprises through diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings through diligence and thrift, paying attention to saving every bit, and making increasing production and practicing economy a lasting and regular practice, turning it into a social trend. This is the main responsibility and due obligation of the people of the whole country. Within the enterprise, it is even more important to strengthen planning management, strengthen the accuracy of design drawings and construction plans, and prepare for manpower, material resources, and materials before construction, and organize balanced construction. Ensure project quality and construction safety in the work, because poor quality and poor safety attention are the biggest waste and will bring bad consequences.

First, within the enterprise, we must pay attention to construction safety, establish a safety system, establish safety activity days, establish safety technical operating procedures and safety lectures, so that every construction worker understands safety knowledge, and there must be monthly and annual safety measures plans, and an organized safety inspection system to ensure the health of workers and avoid any injury. This is one of the most important aspects of increasing production and practicing economy.

Second, increasing production and practicing economy requires a large amount of promotion of waste utilization, renovation and utilization of original equipment, and promotion of new technologies. In 1956, Anshan Construction of Angang, in response to the great call for increasing production and practicing economy put forward by Chairman Mao at the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, with the support of the people of the whole country, under the correct leadership of the provincial and municipal party committees, and with the joint efforts of all engineering and technical personnel and workers, has completed and overfulfilled the 1956 national plan, and reached the level of completing the Five-Year Plan in four years.

1.  In terms of savings, some achievements have also been made, such as in the Anshan Iron and Steel Steelmaking Plant, improving operating methods, such as using slag-making agents when casting boiling steel ingots, reducing the head cutting rate of steel ingots by 1% under the condition of ensuring quality, increasing the production of more than 13,000 tons of steel for the country throughout the year.
2.  For example, the Anshan Iron and Steel Medium Plate Factory improved its operating methods, heated evenly, carefully adjusted the roll shape, and paid attention to steel plate trimming. In January of this year alone, it saved 563 tons of steel plate for the country.
3.  In our workshop in 1956, all workers and engineering and technical personnel actively sought ways to tap the potential of the enterprise, and used the original waste steel rolls and waste parts to create a combined hot-rolling steel extension machine for production. As for the steel bar materials used, waste steel edges and waste steel bars not used in the project from Anshan Iron and Steel's first and second small factories were used. After heating and rolling, the waste steel was turned into good steel, which solved the phenomenon of work stoppage waiting for materials. The successful creation of our rolling mill is a result of learning from the experience of brother factories and mines, and it was successful with the massive support of brother factories and mines in terms of technology, manpower and material resources. Its effectiveness is that it can roll φ6, φ9, and φ12 steel bars, which are produced and used by ourselves to supply industrial construction. According to preliminary calculations, each ton of steel bars can save 260 yuan. Calculating based on the daily rolling of five tons of φ6 steel bars, it can save the country 1,300 yuan. Calculating monthly, it can save the country 39,000 yuan. Throughout the year, it can increase the country's wealth by 432,000 yuan. However, although we have achieved some success in production, we have not yet met the requirements of the Party and the people. Under the education of the Party, we will never be satisfied with this, and will continue to work hard, without pride or arrogance, unite everyone, fully develop democracy, rely on the masses to give full play to everyone's wisdom, tap the potential of the enterprise, make full use of old equipment, learn from each other, help each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, jointly improve, continue to carry out socialist competitions, carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, and strive to fully complete the first Five-Year Plan, and strive for the peaceful liberation of the motherland's territory of Taiwan, so that Taiwanese compatriots can return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible and build socialism with us, living a free, happy and joyful life.

Finally, I would like to make two suggestions for the conference's reference:

1.  Our Liaoning Province has five or six heavy industrial cities, and most of the engineering and technical personnel and workers are hired from all over the country. This has resulted in a situation where there are more men than women. The issue of finding partners has become a problem for our workers and technical personnel. If they can't find one, it will cause workers and technical personnel to be uneasy at work. I suggest whether to build several light industries in Anshan, Fushun, Shenyang, and Yangzhangzi to solve the problem, which would also avoid workers going to the countryside to find partners, and solve the problem that rural women are unwilling to find partners with farmers.
2.  I suggest that the central Ministry of Coal Industry can transfer good coal to our Anshan Iron and Steel. If we reduce the ash content of our coke by 1%, we can increase the production of pig iron by 2%, which will increase the production of 65,000 tons of pig iron for the country throughout the year, saving huge amounts of wealth.
3.  Under the conditions of tight steel production, we should use a large number of precast concrete components, and use precast components for power poles, and develop prestressed concrete components to save wood and steel. In addition, bamboo reinforcement can also be used to replace steel in non-critical projects that do not affect quality, saving wealth for the country. Please criticize and correct my speech if it is not correct.

    企业内部怎样增产节约
    黄德茂的发言
    要确保工人生产的安全——要充分利用原有设备，推广新技术——几点建议
    我以兴奋心情，参加全国政协第二届第三次会议。在开会前几天里，我能够光荣的参加我们国家最高国务会议，是我梦想不到的。在会上听到毛主席讲话正确处理人民内部矛盾等十二条的指示，周总理友谊访问十一国家的报告，李富春副总理第二个五年计划说明报告和增产节约的指示，陈叔通副主席政协常务委员会工作报告，我完全同意和拥护，给我莫大鼓舞和启发。
    现在我要谈谈，在我们企业内部，如何把增产节约做得更好，给国家积累更多资金，加快工业化的建设速度。在工业建设人们，必须精打细算，抱着中央指示精神，勤俭建国，勤俭办企业，勤俭办一切事业，注意点滴节约，把增产节约作到持久而经常，变成社会上的风气，这是全国人民的主要责任和应有的义务。在企业内部更重要的，必须加强计划管理、加强设计图纸准确性和施工计划，在施工前要作好人力、物力、材料准备工作，组织均衡施工。在工作中保证工程质量和施工安全，因为质量不好，安全注意不好，是最大的浪费，会带来不良的恶果。
    一、在企业内部必须注意施工安全，建立安全制度、建立安全活动日、建立安全技术操作规程和安全讲座，促使每个施工人员懂得安全知识，要有月的年的安全措施计划，要有组织的安全检查制度，确保工人身体健康，不受任何损伤。是增产节约重要之一。
    二、增产节约须要大量提倡废物利用、改建利用原有设备和推广新技术，我们鞍钢鞍建在1956年在响应党八届二中全会毛主席提出增产节约伟大号召下，由于全国人民支援，在省市委正确领导下以及全体工程技术人员和工人共同努力，已经完成和超额完成1956年国家计划，并达到四年完成五年计划水平。
    1、在节约方面也作出点滴成绩，如鞍钢炼钢厂，改进操作方法，如沸腾钢铸锭时，采用造渣剂方法，在保证质量的条件下，降低钢锭的切头率1％，全年给国家多增产一万三千多吨钢。
    2、如鞍钢中板厂，改进作业操作方法，均匀加热，细心调整辊型，注意钢板剪边，仅今年1月份就为国家节约五百六十三吨钢板。
    3、我们车间在1956年，在全体工人和工程技术人员，积极找窍门挖掘企业内部的潜在力量，利用原有废钢辊和废零件，创造一台联合式的热轧伸钢机投入生产，而至于钢筋使用材料，是利用鞍钢一、二小型厂废钢边和工程不用的废钢筋，经过加热和轧制，就把废钢变成好的钢材，这样解决停工待料的现象。我们的轧钢机的创造成功，是学习兄弟厂矿的经验，是兄弟厂矿从技术、人力、物力大量支援下，而获得成功的。它的效能，能轧制φ6、φ9、φ12钢筋，是自产自用供给工业建设，从初步计算，在每一吨钢筋能节约二百六十元，在每天能轧五吨φ6钢筋来算可给国家节省一千三百元，在每月计算可给国家节省三万九千元，全年可给国家增加财富四十三万二千元。但是，虽然在生产上取得一点成绩，还没有达到党和人民对我们要求。我们在党的教育下，决不以此为满足，继续努力，不骄不傲的，团结大家，充分发扬民主，依靠群众发挥大家智慧，挖掘企业内部潜力，要充分利用旧有设备，互相学习，互相帮助，取长补短共同提高，继续开展社会主义竞赛、开展增产节约运动，为全面完成第一个五年计划而努力，为争取和平解放祖国领土台湾、让台胞早日回到祖国怀抱，和我们在一起共同建设社会主义，过着自由幸福愉快生活。
    最后提出两个建议请大会参考：
    1、我们辽宁省有五、六个重工业城市，而工程技术人员和工人，大半都由全国各地聘请来的，这样一来就造成了男多女少情况，而我们工人、技术人员对于搞对象这件事情，就成了问题，搞不到造成工人、技术人员在工作上不安心。我建议是否在鞍山市、抚顺市、沈阳市和杨杖子建设几处轻工业，来解决问题，也就免去工人到农村去搞，农村妇女不愿与农民搞对象也就解决。
    2、建议中央煤炭工业部，能否给我们鞍钢调剂好的煤炭，如果把我们焦炭灰分率降低1％的话，而生铁就能多增产2％，全年就给国家多增产六万五千吨生铁，节省巨大财富。
    3、在生产钢铁紧张的条件下，要大量采用预制混凝土构件，把电线杆多用预制构件，要发展预应力混凝土构件节约木材和钢材。另外在不影响质量和不重要工程也可以利用竹筋代替钢材，给国家节省财富。我的发言是否正确，请批评指正。
