    Producing Our Own Radio Facsimile Telegraph Paper
    This newspaper reports that the facsimile telegraph paper, which was previously reliant on imports, has been successfully developed by Comrade Yu Shaoyu of the Beijing Railway Science Research Institute. Tests and evaluations have proven its effectiveness.
    The characteristic of this paper is its ability to record faithfully and clearly the text, images, and seals transmitted from the other end. The recording speed reaches 30 meters per minute, and it is unaffected by temperature and humidity. Simultaneously, working in light not only does not expose the paper, but it can also omit procedures such as developing and fixing.
    Radio telegraph facsimile paper has a wide range of uses. Besides being used as facsimile telegraph paper, it can also be used as recording paper for high-speed recorders such as vibration instruments and electrocardiographs. It can also be applied in mining, bridge inspections, and various scientific experiments.
    Currently, active preparations are underway to put this paper into production.

    Versatile Small Milling Machine
    A Machine That Can Make Exquisite Watch Wheels
    Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, February 2nd: A horizontal electric versatile small milling machine capable of producing wheels for wristwatches and pocket watches has recently been successfully trial-manufactured in Qingdao.
    This small and exquisite milling machine has a volume of just over one cubic foot. It is equipped with a small electric motor, as well as levers for adjusting the angle and levers for controlling fast, medium, and slow speeds. It can produce delicate wheel pieces and axles with a diameter of twelve millimeters, and it can also mill the extremely small clutch wheel, which is the most difficult part to make on a watch.
    This small milling machine was successfully trial-manufactured by Sun Tiankong, a 26-year-old member of the Qingdao Third Clock and Watch Repair Production Cooperative. During the trial-manufacturing process, his only reference material was a photograph of an actual versatile milling machine. (Attached picture)

    提高技术增加新产品
    自制无线电传真电报纸
    本报讯  一向靠外国进口的传真电报纸，已经由北京铁道科学研究院余少玉同志试制成功，经过试验和鉴定证明效果良好。
    这种纸的特点是能将对方传送来的文字、图片、印章等真实清楚地记录下来，记录速度每分钟达三十公尺，并不受温湿度的影响。同时，在光线下进行工作不但不会感光，反而能省略显影和定影等手续。
    无线电报传真纸的用途较广，除了作传真电报纸外，还可作振动仪、心动电流图等高速记录仪的记录纸。其它在采矿、桥梁检查以及各项科学试验工作中都能运用。
    目前，这种纸正积极准备投入生产。
    万能小铣床
    能制精致表轮的机器
    新华社青岛2日电  一台生产手表、怀表轮子的卧式电动万能小铣床新近在青岛试制成功。
    这台小巧玲珑的铣床体积约有一立方市尺多一点，上面装有一个很小的电动机，有供调整斜度的刁杆和控制快、中、慢三种车速的刁杆等。它能制做精致的直径十二毫米的轮片和轮轴，还能铣出手表上最难做的极小的离合轮。
    这台小铣床是青岛第三钟表修配生产合作社一个二十六岁的社员孙天孔试制成功的。在试制过程中，他的唯一参考资料是一张万能铣轮机的实物照片。（附图片）
