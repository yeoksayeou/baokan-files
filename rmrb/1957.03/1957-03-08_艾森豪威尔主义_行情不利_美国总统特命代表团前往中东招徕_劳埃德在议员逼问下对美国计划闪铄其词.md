Xinhua News Agency, March 7th: Washington dispatch: A U.S. presidential special mission will depart for the Middle East on the 12th to peddle the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

Richard, the head of the mission, said that his group will consist of eight to ten people, including representatives from the International Cooperation Administration, the State Department, and the Department of Defense. The mission is scheduled to stay in the Middle East for six to eight weeks.

Xinhua News Agency, March 7th: London dispatch: British Foreign Secretary Lloyd stated in the House of Commons on the 6th that Britain will "decide for itself" "to what extent" it will support the "Eisenhower Doctrine." At the same time, he also stated that the British government welcomes the U.S. Middle East plan.

The Labor Party's chief spokesman on foreign affairs, Bevan, asked whether Britain would automatically be drawn in if Eisenhower determined that a (Middle Eastern) country was threatened by "international communism." Lloyd replied that it would not. However, when the current Labor Party Defence Minister Shinwell demanded that the government guarantee not to become involved in disputes caused by the United States in the Middle East, Lloyd replied: "We believe that resisting communist aggression in the Middle East is also in Britain's interests."

    “艾森豪威尔主义”行情不利
    美国总统特命代表团前往中东招徕
    劳埃德在议员逼问下对美国计划闪铄其词
    据新华社7日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统特命代表团即将于12日启程前往中东兜售“艾森豪威尔主义”。
    代表团团长理查兹说，他的一行将有八人到十人，其中将包括国际合作署、国务院和国防部的代表。这个代表团预定在中东停留六到八个星期。
    据新华社7日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交大臣劳埃德6日在下院表示，英国将“自己决定”在“多大程度”上支持“艾森豪威尔主义”，他同时又表示英国政府欢迎美国的这个中东计划。
    工党外交问题主要发言人比万问道，要是艾森豪威尔断定有一个（中东）国家受到“国际共产主义”威胁，那么，英国是否会自动地卷进去？劳埃德回答说，不会这样。但是，当前工党国防大臣辛威尔要求政府保证不卷入美国在中东引起的纠纷的时候，劳埃德却回答说：“我们以为，抵抗共产党对中东的侵略也是符合英国利益的。”
