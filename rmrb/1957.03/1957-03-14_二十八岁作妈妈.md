	At noon on March 7th, in the maternity ward of the Dongsi Maternity Hospital in Beijing, Liu Shuhui, a twenty-eight-year-old who was becoming a mother for the first time, had a happy smile on her face as she lowered her head to breastfeed her six-day-old son.

	At this time, her mother-in-law, Old Mrs. Gao, and her sister came to the hospital. The nurse dressed the baby in the brand-new little clothes they brought and wrapped him in a small quilt. The mother-in-law and sister happily took the mother and child home.

	The reporter also went to the Gao's house to share in the family's joy.

	As soon as they entered the door, Old Mrs. Gao was busy taking care of her daughter-in-law, offering her water. Liu Shuhui's father-in-law carefully examined the appearance of his first grandson. Several days earlier, Old Mrs. Gao had written a letter to tell the child's father, Gao Zishu, who works in Dalian, the good news.

	Liu Shuhui is a worker in a factory in Beijing. She married Gao Zishu when she was twenty-six years old. Before this childbirth, her mother was worried that her age would make the birth difficult. However, Liu Shuhui was still working at the factory during the day on the day she gave birth. She only went to the hospital when she felt labor pains in the evening and gave birth that night, very smoothly.

	Old Mrs. Gao was so happy that she couldn't stop smiling. She said, "Our family is so happy. We had a grandson last year, and this year we have another grandson." It turns out that this is a family that found happiness in "late marriage": she has two twenty-seven-year-old twin daughters. The elder daughter got married last year and had a son that same year. The younger daughter only got married this New Year's Day. Her second son is twenty-four years old, and her third son is twenty-one years old. She advised them to find partners later.

	However, coincidentally, Liu Shuhui's sister, Wenrong, who was sitting next to her, was in a different situation: she got married at the age of eighteen, and although she is only thirty-one years old this year, she is already the mother of five children. She sighed and said, "Who wouldn't want to work? I'm just worn out by the children!" It turned out that she was a telephone operator at the telecommunications bureau. In the old society, her supervisor took advantage of her maternity leave after her second child to dismiss her. Then she had three more children, so she had to stay at home all day to worry about the children's food, clothing, and shelter. Sometimes three children were sick at the same time, which made it even more difficult to cope, and family life was affected.

	Her sister's experience left a deep impression on Liu Shuhui's mind. Liu Shuhui had long made up her mind to marry later. This female worker, who has been working for more than ten years, is now a fifth-grade worker because she can concentrate on production. Her production team also won the factory's first prize for excellent performance in the competition. She told me that her monthly salary is not only enough for her own use, but she also often subsidizes her sister's life. Her education level has also improved compared to before.

	As I bid farewell to this happy family, I asked Liu Shuhui when she would want another daughter. She smiled and said: At least three years later.

    二十八岁作妈妈
    新华社记者  安仲皇
    三月七日中午，在北京市东四产院的产妇休养室里，第一次作妈妈的二十八岁的刘淑惠的脸上浮着愉快的笑容，低着头给她刚生下六天的儿子喂奶。
    这时候，她的婆婆高老太太和她的姐姐来到产院。护士给孩子穿上她们带来的簇新的小衣服，包上小被褥。婆婆和姐姐欢欢喜喜地把她们母子接回了家。
    记者也一道到了高家，分享这个家庭的欢乐。
    刚一进门，高老太太就忙着照顾儿媳妇喝水。刘淑惠的公公仔细地端详着第一个孙子的模样。早在几天前高老太太就写信把这个好消息告诉了孩子的爸爸——在大连工作的高子枢。
    刘淑惠是北京某厂的工人，在二十六岁时才和高子枢结婚。这次生孩子以前，她的妈妈还替她担心，怕因年龄大生产困难。可是刘淑惠在生孩子那天的白天还在工厂工作，晚上有动静才到产院，夜里就生了，生的很顺利。
    高老太太高兴得一直闭不上嘴。她说，我们这一家可幸福了，去年得了外孙子，今年又得了孙子。原来这是一个从“晚婚”中找到了幸福的家庭：她有两个二十七岁的双生女儿，大女儿去年结婚，当年就生了个儿子；二女儿今年元旦才结婚。她二儿子二十四岁，三儿子二十一岁，她都劝他们晚点找对象。
    可是，十分凑巧，坐在一旁的刘淑惠的姐姐文蓉却是另外一种情形：她在十八岁上就结了婚，今年虽然才三十一岁，已经是五个孩子的妈妈了。她感慨地说， “谁不愿意参加工作，都是给孩子累住了！”原来她是电信局话务员。在旧社会时她的上司趁她生第二个孩子请产假的机会把她免职了。接着她又生了三个孩子，因此就只好整天在家里为孩子的衣食住操劳。有时三个孩子一道生病，就更加忙不过来，家庭生活也因此受到影响。
    姐姐的遭遇在妹妹的脑海里深深地留下了烙印。刘淑惠早就打好主意要晚点结婚。这位已有十年多工龄的女工，因为能集中精力从事生产，现在已是五级工了。她所在的生产小组也曾经因为在竞赛中成绩优秀获得了工厂一等优胜奖。她告诉我说，现在她每月的工资不但自己够用，而且经常贴补姐姐的生活。她的文化程度也较前提高了。
    当我向这个幸福家庭告别的时候，我问刘淑惠什么时候再要一个女儿？她微笑着说：至少要三年以后。
