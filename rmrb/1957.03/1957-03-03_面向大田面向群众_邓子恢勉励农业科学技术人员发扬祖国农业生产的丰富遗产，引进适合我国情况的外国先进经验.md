　　Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. On the occasion of the founding of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences today, Vice Premier Deng Zihui of the State Council gave a report to more than two hundred agricultural scientists attending the meeting.

　　Deng Zihui said: The Academy of Agricultural Sciences was established after the basic completion of agricultural production cooperation in our country and during the new upsurge of production that is being launched on a wider scale and with more practical work. Due to the collectivization of agricultural production, agricultural production in our country will need scientific assistance even more in the future, and the activities of agricultural science will also have a wider scope. Therefore, the establishment of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences has extremely important significance.

　　Deng Zihui said that the achievements of agricultural science work over the years have been great. In helping farmers summarize production experience, popularize improved varieties and high-yield experiences, and in inventions and research, it has played a huge role in production. At the same time, agricultural science institutions have greatly developed and cultivated a large number of scientific and technical personnel. These achievements should first be attributed to the hard work of hundreds of millions of farmers, who created many experiences in labor practice, thus providing valuable materials for scientists. Secondly, it is due to the painstaking research and long-term efforts of all scientists and technicians, as well as the selfless assistance of Soviet experts. Academician Aleksandrov, Vice President of the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, personally attended the conference, which will give us greater encouragement and help.

　　Deng Zihui pointed out that the development of agricultural production mainly relies on the enthusiasm and creativity of 500 million farmers, but without the help of scientific workers, relying solely on the enthusiasm of the masses is not enough. This requires scientific and technical personnel to help farmers summarize and improve their experiences. Specifically, it is to meet the requirements of the 40-article Agricultural Development Program. To this end, agricultural scientists should launch research in all aspects, including the introduction of improved varieties, fertilizers and fertilization methods, new farm tools, prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests, veterinary epidemic prevention, and technical improvements. And help cooperatives and farms cultivate various technical talents.

　　Deng Zihui said that agronomists should focus on promoting the extremely rich national heritage of our country in agricultural production, while introducing advanced foreign experiences suitable for our country's conditions, and should especially learn from the Soviet Union first. He called on scientists and scientific and technical personnel to face the fields, face the masses, and follow the mass line. He said that learning from farmers and learning perceptual knowledge is not to become farmers, but to raise experience to theory, and then use higher theory to guide practice.

    面向大田面向群众
    邓子恢勉励农业科学技术人员发扬祖国农业生产的丰富遗产，引进适合我国情况的外国先进经验
    新华社2日讯  今天，在中国农业科学院成立大会上，国务院副总理邓子恢为参加大会的二百多个农业科学家作了报告。
    邓子恢说：农业科学院，是在我国农业生产基本上完成合作化之后和正在掀起的规模更广泛，工作更加切实的新的生产高潮中成立的。由于农业生产的集体化，我国今后的农业生产更加需要取得科学的帮助，农业科学的活动也将有更加广阔的范围，因此，农业科学院的成立具有极其重大的意义。
    邓子恢说，多年来农业科学工作的成绩是很大的。在帮助农民总结生产经验，推广良种和丰产经验以及发明、研究等方面对生产起了巨大的成就。同时，农业科学机构有了很大的发展，培养了大批的科学技术人员。这些成绩首先应归功于亿万农民的辛勤劳动，在劳动实践中创造了许多经验，从而为科学家提供了宝贵资料。其次是所有科学家技术人员的苦心研究和长期努力，还有苏联专家的无私帮助。此次全苏列宁农业科学院副院长亚历山斯基院士亲自出席大会，对我们将有更大的鼓舞和帮助。
    邓子恢指出，发展农业生产主要依靠五亿农民的积极性和创造性，但是没有科学工作者的帮助，光靠群众的积极性也是不行的。这就更加需要科学技术人员帮助农民总结提高他们的经验，具体地说，就是要达到发展农业纲要四十条的要求。为此，农业科学家们要展开引用良种、肥料和施肥方法、新农具、防治病虫害、兽医防疫、技术改进等各方面的研究。并且帮助合作社、农场培养各种技术人才。
    邓子恢说，农学家们应该以发扬祖国在农业生产方面极其丰富的民族遗产为主，同时引进适合于我国情况的外国先进经验，特别应该首先向苏联学习。他号召科学家和科学技术人员面向大田、面向群众，走群众路线。他说，向农民学习，学习感性知识并不是为了做农民，而是为了把经验提高为理论，再用更高的理论去指导实践。
