Strengthening Political and Ideological Education in Beijing Middle Schools
Xu Chubo's Speech

　　I will now talk about the situation of middle school education in Beijing, which I am familiar with, and discuss the issue of further implementing the educational policy of all-round development and strengthening political and ideological education. If there are any inappropriate points, please correct me.

　　In the past two years, Beijing has achieved results in implementing the policy of all-round development and improving the quality of education. The students' knowledge quality has been significantly improved. For example, the promotion standards are relatively strict, and the number of students repeating grades has decreased year by year; the results of school entrance examinations have increased year by year, and the admission standards for middle schools have also been improved; the number of "three-good" students has increased year by year. The students' socialist consciousness has been improved to some extent. Generally speaking, the students' ideological character is excellent. They know to study hard for the socialist construction of the motherland. For example, they actively respond to the motherland's call to participate in production and construction, and eligible students actively enlist in the national defense army. Their patriotic enthusiasm is very valuable. The students' health status has generally improved.

　　These achievements are inseparable from the work of teachers. In recent years, thanks to the Party and the government's concern for the majority of teachers in their work, ideological enlightenment and assistance, and care in life, the enthusiasm and ability of teachers have been improved by holding professional training. Most teachers demand progress and work hard. In particular, the emergence of the upsurge of socialist revolution and the call to march towards science have greatly encouraged teachers.

　　However, from the perspective of implementing the policy of all-round development, there are still some shortcomings, mainly manifested in the weakness of political and ideological education. The main reason is that after the proposal of "teaching is the overriding central task of the school" and "marching towards science," many teachers have a one-sided understanding of it, and therefore neglect political and ideological education while focusing on improving students' knowledge quality. In addition, since last year's discussion on the educational policy of all-round development and the abolition of the advanced class collective system, some confusion has been caused in the teachers' thinking. The specific manifestations are: some teachers' purely technical viewpoints are growing, neglecting students' extracurricular activities and unwilling to do or not attaching importance to the work of class teachers; failing to pay attention to the self-education role of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers, failing to promptly strive for the cooperation of parents and other social aspects, and the leadership and planning of political and ideological education are not strong enough.

　　I would like to express some opinions on these issues:

　　1. Strengthen the political and ideological leadership and professional training leadership of teachers. An important aspect of some teachers' purely professional viewpoints—non-political tendencies—is "teaching without educating people, managing in-class without managing extracurricular activities, managing on-campus without managing off-campus," such as attaching importance to professional training but not attaching importance to the study of political theory and educational theory, and even relaxing the correction of students' homework, only paying attention to the knowledge imparting in classroom teaching, while some neglect education and extracurricular tutoring. Some teachers only care about teaching and do not care about students' discipline. Some teachers do not care about current affairs. Some students ask some current affairs questions, some dare not answer, some cannot answer. Some teachers only care about students' learning and do not care about students' ideological character. There are even such students who learn very well, show pride and complacency, and speak to teachers without politeness, but the teachers dare not educate them. Isn't this abandoning educational responsibility? The above also shows that some teachers' views of comprehensive responsibility are not strong enough. Therefore:

　　(1) The professional training and the study of political theory and educational theory of teachers should be given overall consideration and appropriately arranged. Only in this way can the level of teachers be improved and the purpose of educating students be achieved. It is recommended that the relevant departments hold more courses on political theory and educational theory, strengthen planning, and be stricter in requirements, and make overall consideration of the systematic study of the basic courses of Marxism-Leninism and educational theory by teachers and school administrative cadres. At present, the practice organized by Beijing to let middle and primary school teachers deeply study "Another Discussion on the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship" is very good, which will greatly help improve teachers' ideological understanding and improve their work.

　　(2) Further give play to the enthusiasm of teachers, improve the evaluation of teachers' work, pay attention to both teaching effect and education quality—pay attention to the ideological nature of teachers' work and the spirit of comprehensive responsibility. In the teacher collective, encourage humble mutual learning, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and promote the spirit of revolutionary heroism.

　　(3) The guiding teaching and research group should pay attention to studying the experience in education and pay attention to the exchange of experience. "Teacher's Newspaper" and "People's Education" can systematically and plannedly introduce and organize relevant teachers to study.

　　2. Encourage teachers to do a good job in class teacher work. Class teacher work has special and important significance in implementing the educational policy of all-round development and conducting ideological education, because the class teacher must unify the work of teachers, the self-education of students, and the work of parents. This work is arduous, but very interesting and glorious. Many teachers are willing to take on this responsibility. However, some teachers are unwilling to do class teacher work, so this is also a key issue. There are two situations here: some people reject it ideologically, are afraid of trouble and want to save trouble, and claim that "class teacher work is a bottomless pit, which is laborious and unrewarding." This understanding is incorrect. Another part of people feel that their level is low, their methods are few, and there are many difficulties, and they are afraid that they will not be able to do the job well and bring losses to the work. This concern is also unnecessary. The above situation shows that in the future, the specific leadership of class teacher work should be strengthened, so that teachers can further clarify the importance of class teacher work in their minds, and can consciously fulfill their greatest responsibility in education; in the work, specific assistance should be provided to class teachers who have difficulties, and in the work, establish confidence, overcome difficulties, and cultivate interest. Class teachers should plan to cultivate their class to gradually become an excellent class collective, and carry out education through the collective. Class teachers should pay attention to often caring for and guiding the work of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers, and be good at obtaining the help of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers, and turn the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers organizations into their close assistants. In the above two links, the class teachers have relaxed their work somewhat last year, and they should grasp it well. Parent work is even more important in the case of a two-part system.

　　3. Pay attention to giving full play to the self-education role of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers organizations and strengthening the leadership of the work of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers. The Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers organizations have played an important role in cooperating with the Party and the administration in carrying out all-round development education. In recent years, the work of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers has achieved great results. However, there are still some shortcomings, which are inseparable from the lack of specific leadership and assistance, and the lack of sufficient attention and care. How to strengthen the leadership and assistance to the work of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers? I think we should grasp the link of the full-time cadres of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers and put forward the following four points:

　　(1) We must strengthen the leadership of the political theory and professional study of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers cadres, improve their ideological awareness, improve their ability to recognize and analyze problems, and continuously improve their work level. We must help them arrange their study time, and the relevant higher-level Communist Youth League committees, Party branches and administrative leaders should assist in doing this work well.

　　(2) To do a good job in the work of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers, it is necessary to carry out rich and colorful activities. The Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers cadres should spend more time with the members of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers and students so as to deeply understand the situation and strengthen specific and effective leadership and assistance.

　　(3) The higher-level Communist Youth League committees, Party branches and administrative leaders should promptly understand the work, ideological emotions, difficulties and requirements of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers cadres, patiently listen to their opinions, give them support and encouragement in all aspects, and strictly demand them to keep their enthusiasm and sense of responsibility.

　　(4) In the work, we must help the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers cadres cultivate and train activists in the work of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers.

　　4. Require close cooperation and support from all sectors of society. Educating the second generation is the responsibility of the whole society, and the education of students is of course "mainly on campus and supplemented by off-campus." The cooperation of parents is very important, and the cooperation of other aspects is also indispensable. I agree with the opinion of Committee Member Yang Yizhou on this point, but it is necessary to explain the importance of parent work. For example, when the school is conducting college entrance examination guidance for students, one student, with the help of the teacher, determined the volunteer to study literature and apply for a normal school in a down-to-earth manner and was very happy. After returning home, he discussed it with his parents, but unexpectedly ran into a snag and was reprimanded: "No, you are really not promising!" How ruthless is this! I hope that parents will not put pressure on their children. In addition, it needs to be added that newspapers, magazines, and children's publications should also fully pay attention to the issue of educational influence and educational effect. Teenagers do not have a high ability to analyze, and it is inappropriate to educate teenagers with the education methods of adults, and many problems often arise here.

　　Movies have a strong attraction to young people. For example, some students watched the movie "The Young Guard" today and submitted an application to join the Communist Youth League to the Communist Youth League organization tomorrow morning. Students are very interested in the movie "Shangganling" and are willing to learn from the heroic example of the Chinese People's Volunteers. For example, some students sang "The wind is bleak, the rain is dripping" and "Wandering everywhere" all day long after watching "Midnight Song" and "The Vagabond." Of course, my meaning is not that movies such as "Midnight Song" and "The Vagabond" cannot be shown. These types of movies are still good for understanding the past and understanding capitalist countries. They can be shown, but when showing these movies, they should be evaluated and analyzed through newspapers, magazines, or other forms, so that young people can receive positive education. For this reason, it is recommended that the relevant departments plan to show some excellent films on Sundays, holidays, and festivals, and it is recommended that the relevant departments plan to produce some films suitable for young people to watch and cooperate in conducting education.

　　In summary, it is recommended that the education administrative department strengthen leadership, make future work more planned, and thoroughly implement the policies and policies into the work of each teacher. We should pay attention to closely combining temporary measures with long-term educational policies, otherwise, it will produce one-sidedness. For example, the strengthening of labor education, discipline education, and comprehensive technical education proposed in recent years has produced one-sidedness among teachers in the implementation. Some people regard labor education as a blitz-style employment education, discipline education has not been well summarized and adhered to, and comprehensive technical education is like a gust of wind, and some are divorced from the current reality. In the past, the political and ideological education we conducted was not systematic enough and not complete enough. In the implementation of the educational policy of all-round development, some were not thorough enough, and some were one-sided. The method of education is generally through large-scale movements, so there are some ups and downs. In the future, it is recommended to consider carrying out regular systematic political and ideological education and strengthen the education of political classes.

　　We must, with the spirit of hard work and frugality in running schools, resolutely and further implement the educational policy of all-round development, strengthen political and ideological education, improve the quality of education, and train students to become socialist active builders and glorious laborers with both moral integrity and ability and sound physique.

### 加强北京市中学里的政治思想教育　徐楚波的发言

　　加强北京市中学里的政治思想教育
　　徐楚波的发言
    我现在就我所熟习的北京市中学教育的一些情况，谈一谈进一步贯彻全面发展的教育方针，加强政治思想教育的问题，如有不妥之处，请各位指正。
    近两年来，北京市在贯彻全面发展的方针，提高教育质量方面是有成绩的。学生的知识质量有了显著的提高，比如升级的标准比较严格，而留级的人数逐年下降；考学的成绩逐年上升，中学录取的标准也有所提高；三好学生逐年增多。学生的社会主义觉悟，有所提高，一般说来，学生的思想品质是优良的，知道为祖国的社会主义建设而努力学习，比如积极响应祖国号召，参加生产建设，适龄学生的积极应征，参加国防军，他们所表现的爱国热情，是很可贵的。学生的健康状况一般的说有所改善。
    取得这些成绩，是与教师的工作分不开的。几年来，由于党和政府对广大教师在工作上的关怀，思想上的启发帮助，生活上的照顾，举办业务进修，提高了教师工作的积极性和工作能力。大多数教师是要求进步的，工作是努力的，尤其是社会主义革命高潮的出现，以及向科学进军的号召，对教师的鼓舞很大。
    但是，从贯彻全面发展方针来看，还存在着一些缺点，主要表现是政治思想教育工作的薄弱，其主要原因是提出“教学是学校压倒一切的中心任务”和“向科学进军”之后，不少教师作了片面的了解，因而在抓提高学生的知识质量时，忽视了政治思想教育，再加上去年以来对全面发展的教育方针的讨论、评选先进班集体制度的取消，在教师思想上引起一些混乱。具体的表现：有些教师单纯技术观点的滋长，忽视学生的课外活动和不愿作、不重视班主任工作；不注意发挥团队的自我教育作用，未能及时争取家长等社会方面的配合，政治思想教育的领导和计划性不够强。
    我就这几个问题发表一点意见：
    一、加强对教师的政治思想领导和业务进修的领导。有些教师单纯业务观点——非政治倾向——表现的一个重要方面是“教书不教人，管课内不管课外，管校内不管校外”，如重视业务进修，不重视政治理论和教育理论的学习，甚至放松了对学生作业的批改，只注意课堂教学的知识传授，而有的忽视了教育性和课外辅导。有的教师，只管教书，不管学生的纪律。有的教师不关心时事，学生问的一些时事问题，有的不敢回答，有的不能回答，有的教师只管学生的学习，不管学生的思想品质，竟有这样的学生，学习学得很好，表现骄傲自满，对教师说话毫无礼貌，而教师不敢教育，这不是放弃教育责任吗？以上也说明有些教师全面负责的观点是还不够强。因此：
    （一）教师的业务进修和政治理论、教育理论的学习，应统筹兼顾适当安排，只有这样，才能提高教师的水平，才能达到教育好学生的目的。建议有关方面，多举办一些政治理论和教育理论的学习科目，并且加强计划性，要求严格些，把教师和学校行政干部系统的学习马列主义的基础课程和教育理论作全盘考虑。目前建议有关部门把全面发展方针问题的讨论情况总结一下，向全体教师作一报告，指出今后工作的方向。现在北京市所组织的中、小学教师深入学习“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”的作法是很好的，将会对提高教师的思想认识，改进工作，有很大的帮助。
    （二）进一步发挥教师的积极性，改进对教师工作的评定，既要注意教学效果，又要注意教育质量——注意教师工作中的思想性，和全面负责的精神。在教师集体中，鼓励虚心的互相学习，开展批评和自我批评发扬革命英雄主义的精神。
    （三）指导教研组应注意研究教育方面的经验，并注意经验交流。“教师报”和“人民教育”可以系统的有计划的介绍。组织有关的教师学习。
    二、鼓励教师作好班主任工作。班主任工作，在贯彻全面发展的教育方针，进行思想教育方面，有特殊重要的意义，因为班主任要把教师的工作、学生的自我教育、家长工作统一起来，这个工作是艰巨的，但很有趣味，也很光荣。这个责任有很多教师是愿意担任的。但是有些教师不愿作班主任工作，所以这也是一个关键性的问题。在这里有两种情况：一部分人是从思想上排斥它，怕麻烦找省事，并且托词说：“班主任工作是无底洞，费力不讨好。”这种认识是不正确的。另一部分人是感到自己水平低办法少，困难多，怕不能胜任，给工作带来损失。这种顾虑也是不必要的。以上情况说明，今后应加强班主任工作的具体领导，使教师在思想上进一步明确班主任工作的重要性，在教育中能自觉的尽自己的最大责任；在工作中对于有困难的班主任进行具体的帮助，在工作中树立信心，克服困难培养兴趣，班主任要有计划的培养自己的班逐步的成为优良的班集体，通过集体进行教育。班主任要注意经常关心和指导团、队的工作，善于取得团队的帮助，把团、队组织变成自己的亲密助手。以上两个环节，班主任教师，在去年工作是有些放松的，应当很好的抓起来。家长工作，在二部制的情况下，显得更加重要了。
    三、注意充分发挥青年团、少先队组织的自我教育作用，加强团队工作的领导。团队组织在配合党和行政进行全面发展的教育中，起了重要的作用，几年来，团队工作上有很大的成绩。但是还有些缺点，这和缺乏具体的领导和帮助，缺乏足够的重视和关怀是分不开的。对团队工作如何加强领导和帮助呢？我认为应抓住团队脱产干部这一环节，提出如下四点意见：
    （一）要加强对团队干部的政治理论和业务学习的领导，提高他们的思想觉悟，提高认识分析问题的能力，不断提高工作水平，要帮助他们安排学习时间，有关上级团委、党支部和行政领导要协助作好这项工作。
    （二）把团队工作搞好必须开展丰富多采的活动，团干部应有较多的时间和团队员、同学生生活在一起，以便深入了解情况，加强具体的有效的领导和帮助。
    （三）上级团委、党支部和行政领导，应及时了解团队干部的工作情况、思想情绪、困难和要求，耐心地听取他们的意见，在各方面给他们以支持和鼓励，并且要严格地要求他们，使他们经常保持积极性和责任感。
    （四）在工作中，要帮助团队干部培养和训练团队工作中的积极分子。
    四、要求社会各方面的密切合作和支持。教育第二代是全社会的责任，而对学生的教育当然是“以校内为主，以校外为辅”，家长的配合是很重要的，其他各方面的配合也不可缺少，这一点我同意杨亦周委员的意见，但需要说明一下家长工作的重要性，举个例子，学校在对学生进行升学指导时，有一个学生在教师的帮助下，实事求是地确定了志愿要学文，报师范，很高兴，回家以后给家长商量，不料碰了个钉子，被申斥一顿：“不行，你真没有出息！”这是如何的无情！希望家长对自己的孩子不要施加压力。另外需要补充说明的是报刊杂志儿童读物，也要充分重视教育影响和教育效果的问题，青少年的分析能力不高，用成年人的教育方法去教育青少年是不妥当的，而很多问题也往往出在这里。
    电影对青少年的吸引力很强。比如有的学生今天看了“青年近卫军”的影片，明天早晨就向团组织提出了入团的申请。学生对“上甘岭”这部影片很感兴趣，为此，愿意学习志愿军的英雄榜样。又例如，有些学生看了“夜半歌声”“流浪者”后，整天唱“风凄凄，雨淋淋”“到处流浪”。当然，我的意思不是说“夜半歌声”“流浪者”这类影片不能演，这类影片对了解过去、了解资本主义国家，还是有好处的，是可以放映的，不过，在放映这些影片时，应该通过报纸、杂志或其他形式，对这类影片进行评价、分析，能使青少年受到正面的教育。为此，建议有关方面，在星期日、假日、节日，有计划地放映一些优秀的影片，并建议有关方面有计划地摄制一些适合于青少年看的影片，配合进行教育。
    综合以上情况，建议教育行政部门加强领导，使今后工作更有计划，对方针政策的贯彻，应深入地贯彻到每个教师的工作中，应注意把临时性的措施和长远的教育方针，密切结合起来，否则会产生片面性，如近年来先后提出的加强劳动教育、纪律教育和综合技术教育，就在执行中，在教师中产生了片面性，有些人把劳动教育就看成是突击式的就业教育，纪律教育未能很好的总结坚持下来，综合技术教育如像刮了一阵风，有些脱离目前实际。过去，我们所进行的政治思想教育是不够系统的、不够完整的，在贯彻执行全面发展的方针时，有些是不够彻底的，有些是片面的。教育的方法，一般的是通过大的运动，所以，是有些起伏的。今后建议考虑进行经常的系统的政治思想教育，加强政治课的教育。
    我们要以艰苦奋斗、勤俭办学的精神，坚决地进一步地贯彻全面发展的教育方针，加强政治思想教育，提高教育质量，培养学生成为德才兼备、体魄健全的社会主义的积极建设者、光荣的劳动者。（附图片）
