    Put Down the Empty Pretense
    Peng Botong
    Small-bourgeois intellectuals have long been divorced from production and reality, hence "unaccustomed to physical labor, unable to distinguish the five grains," mistaking wheat for leeks, and believing that blast furnaces can refine steel is not surprising. Logically, they should know more of what is in books, but the fact is not so. Many things in junior high school textbooks, and even elementary school textbooks, they may not even know.
    This is ignorance left over from the old society. It is not surprising that intellectuals lack knowledge and are unworthy of the name. As long as we are self-aware, learn when we don't understand, and constantly train ourselves in work and life, the problem can be gradually solved. However, some people do not do this, but hang up the signboard of their academic qualifications and positions, complacent and even strutting about.
    Merely manipulating Marxist-Leninist phrases cannot improve one's political and theoretical level, nor can it make up for the emptiness of one's lack of knowledge. However, some people think it can, so they "understand" even without learning, and "understand" everything. When it comes to geography, Hohhot is east of "Gui Sui," and many international conferences are held in Geneva, the "capital" of Switzerland. "Russia" has a Kautsky, who is a revolutionary traitor. When it comes to calligraphy, Liu "Zongyuan" and Ouyang "Xiu" wrote very well and can be called the four masters of Yan, Liu, Ou, and Su. When it comes to physics, "energy" can be "created," otherwise, why can pulleys "save effort," and why do automatic watches keep running when worn on the wrist? ...
    Mr. Lu Xun once described the intellectuals of feudal society: "At that time, Confucian scholars pondered high-sounding chapters in private schools, which had nothing to do with the country and the world, but once they passed the imperial examinations, it was truly 'one success brings worldwide fame.' They could compile history, evaluate essays, govern the people, and manage rivers; by the end of the Qing Dynasty, they could even run schools, open coal mines, train new armies, build warships, present new policies, and go abroad for investigation." ("Qiejieting Essays, Second Collection": "Celebrities and Famous Sayings") Of course, it is no longer a feudal society now, and today's intellectuals are not "Confucian scholars." But it cannot be said that the lack of knowledge and the bad habit of pretending to understand and speaking nonsense among today's intellectuals have no blood relationship with the remnants of the old society.
    It is not worrying that intellectuals lack knowledge; what is worrying is pretending to understand when one does not. The reason for pretending is half due to ignorance and half due to arrogance. Because of ignorance, they are arrogant; because of arrogance, they are even more ignorant. The reason why they can pretend is because there are more people who don't understand. Although those who pretend often say things that are completely irrelevant, they can still get away with it. If everyone can put down the empty pretense of intellectuals, make up for their cultural knowledge, and gradually become worthy of their names, even if someone wants to continue pretending, they will only become a laughingstock.

    放下空架子
    彭伯通
    小资产阶级知识分子长期脱离生产，脱离实际，因而“四体不勤，五谷不分”，麦子当韭菜，高炉可炼钢，不足为怪。论理，书本上的东西，总应多知道一些，然而事实又并不如此，许多初中课本乃至小学课本里面有的东西也不一定知道。
    这是旧社会遗留下来的无知，知识分子缺乏知识，名不副实，也不足为怪。只要我们有自知之明，不懂就学，不断在工作和生活中锻炼自己，问题就可逐步解决。但是，有些人并不这样做，挂起学历和职务的招牌，怡然自得，甚至高视阔步。
    光是搬弄马克思列宁主义的词句，固然不能提高自己的政治理论水平，同时也不能弥补自己知识缺乏的空虚。然而有些人竟认为能够，于是不学也“懂”，什么都“懂”。谈到地理，呼和浩特在“归绥”的东面，很多国际会议在瑞士的“首都”日内瓦举行。“俄国”有个考茨基，是革命叛徒。谈到书法，柳“宗元”、欧阳“修”字写得很好，堪称颜、柳、欧、苏四大家。谈到物理学，“能”是可以“创生”的，不然使用滑轮为什么可以“省力”，自动手表为什么带在手上不停？……
    鲁迅先生曾刻划过封建社会的知识分子：“那时候，儒生在私塾里揣摩高头讲章，和天下国家何涉，但一登第，真是‘一举成名天下知’，他可以修史，可以衡文，可以临民，可以治河；到清朝之末，更可以办学校，开煤矿，练新军，造战舰，条陈新政，出洋考察了。”（“且介亭杂文二集”：“名人和名言”）现在当然已非封建社会，现在的知识分子也非“儒生”。但是不能说，现在知识分子的缺乏知识和不懂装懂、信口开河的毛病同旧社会的遗毒没有血缘关系。
    知识分子缺乏知识并不足虑，可虑者在于不懂装懂。其所以要装，半由无知，半由自大；惟其无知，所以自大，惟其自大，更加无知，其所以能装，因为不懂的人比较多，装懂的人尽管时常牛头不对马嘴，居然装得下去。如果大家能够放下知识分子的空架子，补习补习文化知识，名实逐渐相副起来，纵有人要继续装下去，也只有贻笑大方而已。
