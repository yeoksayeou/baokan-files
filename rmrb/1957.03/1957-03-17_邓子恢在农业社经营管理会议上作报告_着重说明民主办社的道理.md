Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: Why is it necessary to implement democratic cooperative management? What is the content of democratic cooperative management? How can democratic cooperative management be implemented? These are several issues that Deng Zihui, Vice Premier of the State Council, focused on in his report at the National Agricultural Production Cooperative Management Conference today.

Deng Zihui said that the nature of agricultural cooperatives is collective ownership by peasants, which is different from state-owned farms and enterprises and other production organizations that are generally owned by the whole people. The production and operation of agricultural cooperatives should be led using democratic management methods. At the same time, from the perspective of leadership methods, the leadership method of "from the masses, to the masses" should also be implemented. If the leadership is not combined with the masses, or the combination is not good, then cadres will commit the mistakes of subjectivism, paternalism, and detachment from the masses, and may even become corrupt and degenerate. From the perspective of developing production and increasing income, it is even more necessary to rely on the collective wisdom and collective labor of cooperative members. Only by mobilizing the production enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of cooperative members, coupled with the guidance of higher-level organizations and the help of scientists and technicians, can the cooperative be run well.

Deng Zihui gave examples, such as the issue of production materials joining the cooperative and their valuation, the issue of formulating production plans, the issue of promoting advanced yield-increasing measures, the division of production teams and cultivation areas, the issue of labor quotas and work point standards, and the distribution plan and production investment. If these issues are not discussed with cooperative members and decided through mass discussion, it will be difficult to handle them reasonably. In short, everything must go through cooperative members and rely on the masses; otherwise, the cooperative will not be run well, and there will be no guarantee of increasing production and increasing income.

Regarding the content of democratic cooperative management, Deng Zihui said that first of all, long-term production plans and current-year production plans must be made well. The formulation of these plans must be based on the needs of the state, the agricultural cooperative, and the cooperative members, as well as the possible conditions possessed by the cooperative. At the same time, the national plan must be combined with the independence of the agricultural cooperative's operation. In order to make the production plan feasible, it is necessary to consult with elderly farmers, absorb their useful opinions, and convene cadre meetings, member meetings, or member representative meetings to discuss and approve it. The promotion of advanced yield-increasing measures must also be carried out according to local conditions and at the right time. Issues such as labor organization, production teams, labor quotas, fertilizer valuation, contracting work to teams or households, and cadre subsidies should be discussed and decided separately through the cooperative management committee, the production team leader joint meetings, the cooperative representative meetings, or the member meetings. If any are found to be unreasonable, they should be readjusted.

Regarding the financial work of the cooperative, Deng Zihui emphasized that the finances of the agricultural cooperative must be made public. They must be publicized once a year, and the work points and deposits of the members must be publicized once a month. Doing so will be of great benefit to gaining the trust of the members and encouraging their production enthusiasm. At the same time, it can also avoid the special privileges and corruption of some cooperative cadres.

Deng Zihui said that to do a good job in democratic cooperative management, the primary issue is that leading cadres must have a mass viewpoint and a democratic style, and must consult with the masses in everything. At the same time, a democratic system must be established, and cooperative cadres must be produced through democratic elections. Secondly, old farmer forums and professional forums must also be held to gather wisdom and continuously improve production leadership.

Regarding the size of agricultural cooperatives, Deng Zihui said that the idea that the larger the agricultural cooperative, the better, is wrong, and this mistake of formalism and dogmatism must be corrected. He said that in general, areas with concentrated populations can basically have one cooperative per village, while mountainous areas with scattered small villages can have several villages per cooperative, but they should be smaller. Overly large cooperatives should be appropriately separated according to the situation, or changed to the form of joint cooperatives. After the system of contracting work to teams or households is determined, it can remain unchanged for three to five years in order to encourage production teams and members to exceed production quotas and earn bonuses, which is beneficial to the members, the cooperative, and the state. Agricultural cooperative cadres should strive to participate in production and come into contact with reality whenever possible, and should avoid sitting in offices and neglecting production. The lifestyle of agricultural cooperative cadres should be arduous and simple, and they should resolutely guard against special privileges.

In his report today, Deng Zihui also talked about the development of diversified operations in agricultural cooperatives and the issue of uniting middle peasants.

### 邓子恢在农业社经营管理会议上作报告  着重说明民主办社的道理

    邓子恢在农业社经营管理会议上作报告
    着重说明民主办社的道理
    据新华社16日讯　为什么要实行民主办社？民主办社的内容是什么？如何才能贯彻民主办社？这是国务院副总理邓子恢今天在全国农业生产合作社经营管理会议上报告中着重阐述的几个问题。
    邓子恢说，农业社的性质是农民集体所有制，它不同于一般为全民所有的国营农场企业等生产组织。农业社的生产经营是应该用民主的管理方法来进行领导的；同时，从领导方法上来说，也应该贯彻从群众中来，到群众中去的领导方法，如果领导与群众不结合，或结合得不好，那么干部就会犯主观主义、包办代替、脱离群众的错误，甚至还会贪污腐化和蜕化变质。从发展生产增加收入来说，更需要依靠社员群众的集体智慧和集体劳动。只有调动广大社员群众的生产积极性和创造性，加上上级组织的指导和科学家、技术员的帮助，才能把社办好。
    邓子恢举例说，像生产资料的入社和作价问题，生产规划的制订问题，先进增产措施的推广问题，生产队、耕作区的划分，劳动定额、工分标准问题，分配方案和生产投资等许多问题，如果不和社员商量，不经过群众的讨论来确定，那就很难处置得合情合理。总之，事事要通过社员，依靠群众，否则，合作社就办不好，增加生产，增加收入就缺乏保证。
    关于民主办社的内容问题，邓子恢说，首先要作好长远的生产规划与当年的生产规划，这些规划的制订，必须根据国家、农业社和社员的需要和合作社所具备的可能条件，同时，国家计划还必须与农业社经营的独立性结合。为了使生产规划切实可行，就必须通过和老年农民商量，吸取他们的有益的意见，和召开干部会、社员大会或社员代表会来讨论审定。先进增产措施推广，也必须因地因时的来进行，而劳动组织、生产队、劳动定额、肥料作价和包工包产以及干部补贴问题，都要分别通过社管理委员会、生产队长联席会议、合作社代表会或社员大会来讨论决定，发现不合理的要重新调整。
    在合作社的财务工作方面，邓子恢强调说，农业社的财务必须公开，每年要公布一次，而社员的工分和存款要每个月公布一次，这样做对获得社员的信任和鼓舞社员的生产积极性都会有很大好处，同时，也可避免某些社干部的特殊化和贪污舞弊的现象发生。
    邓子恢说，要作好民主办社，首要的问题是领导干部必须具有群众观点和民主作风，并且遇事要和群众商量；同时，还要建立民主制度，社干部要通过民主选举产生；其次，还要召开老农座谈会和专业座谈会，以便集思广益，不断地改进生产领导。
    关于农业社的规模大小问题，邓子恢说，那种认为农业社的规模越大越好的想法是错误的，必须纠正这种形式主义和教条主义的错误。他说，一般人口集中的地区基本上可一村一社，山区分散村小，可以数村一社，但应更小些。过大的社应根据情况适当分开，或改为联社形式。包工包产制确定以后，可以三、五年不变，以便鼓励生产队和社员超产提成，这对社员、合作社和国家都有益处。农业社干部在可能的时候，要竭力争取参加生产，接触实际，切忌光坐机关，不务生产；并且农业社干部的生活作风要艰苦朴素，力戒特殊化。
    邓子恢在今天的报告中，还谈到了农业社发展多种经营和团结中农的问题。
