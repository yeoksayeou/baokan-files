Xinhua News Agency, Accra, 2nd. The people here have shown friendly feelings towards China. A shop assistant in Ghana said that China is "an ancient country with a long culture we learned about in books as children, and now we hear it is an independent new country that is progressing rapidly in all aspects."

However, some people are very unhappy about the friendship between the people of Ghana and the people of China. According to the American "Newsweek," U.S. Vice President Nixon, who was coming here to attend the celebration of Ghana's (Gold Coast) independence ceremony, was "very unhappy after learning that the Chinese Communists were also invited." "Newsweek" also said that the United States "suggested" inviting Taiwan.

    加纳人民对我国友好
    尼克松对加中友好不高兴
    据新华社阿克拉2日电  这里的人民对中国表现了友好的感情。加纳的一位店员说，中国是“我们在儿童时代就从书本上知道的有古老文化的国家，现在我们听说它是一个独立的新国家，在各方面都在飞快地进步”。
    但是，对于加纳人民和中国人民之间的友谊，却有人很不高兴。据美国“新闻周刊”报道，要来这里参加庆祝加纳（黄金海岸）独立典礼的美国副总统尼克松“得知中国共产党也受到邀请之后，很不高兴。”“新闻周刊”还说，美国“建议”邀请台湾。
