I agree with the speeches and reports of Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and Vice Premier Li Fuchun.

I believe that striving for the Second Five-Year Plan for economic construction today, with everything proceeding from increasing production and practicing economy, is correct and essential. I participated in the urban construction group during a work inspection meeting last month. Therefore, I would like to present several principled conditions that should be noted in urban construction to the conference for the reference of relevant departments, which may be beneficial to increasing production and practicing economy.

Since the founding of the country, within a few years, some of the original townships have expanded into cities, the original small cities have generally increased in population and become large cities, and the development of the old large cities has been even more rapid. Under such circumstances, the work of urban construction planning has become increasingly important and urgent. Our government has already established high-level specialized management agencies and various levels of specialized management agencies, which shows that planning has been underway for a long time, with meticulous division of labor. However, China has a vast territory and a long history, with different regions and customs. Although specialized management agencies have deeply studied and thoroughly planned their respective duties, with today's construction development changing rapidly, and the people's will to live improving daily, the construction of a capital or a city is related to the daily life of thousands of years of residents and combined with thousands of years of politics and economy. Without long-term plans, it will be impossible to meet future development. Without emergency measures, it will be impossible to meet current needs. The foundations of new cities and expanded cities are different, and the purposes of rebuilt cities and reorganized cities are different. This is a unique and complex factor of a large and ancient country like China, which gives the urban construction planners of our country difficult tasks. Today, we witness in some large cities that rapid increase of residents, serious traffic burden, increasing shortage of housing, difficult sanitary environment, financial difficulties in urban construction, inability to adapt to the expansion of urban areas, the planning agencies' limited capacity, difficulty in dealing with various parties' appeals, increasing contradictory phenomena, and urgent need for unification. The following are two suggestions for several preparatory works that must be done before formulating urban construction plans and several points that should be paid attention to first when formulating urban construction plans. They are only outlines, and I dare not say that there are no omissions. I hope that colleagues and experts will point them out.

I. Several works that must be prepared when formulating urban construction plans:

	(1) Solicit materials and opinions related to construction planning from relevant departments (especially military and transportation).

	(2) Widely collect relevant archives, gazetteers, charts, reports, etc. And widely solicit the opinions of the local people.

	(3) Representatives of relevant agencies should be responsible for participating in the formulation of construction plans. The municipal people's committee should nominate full-time personnel as secretaries to be responsible for the comprehensive compilation of draft documents. There must also be various experts to cooperate in the division of labor.

	(4) Each city should be distinguished as newly established or existing. And the future purpose: to become an economic city, or a cultural city, or a combination of both. And according to the various guidelines and policies, the type of the city and its zoning, classification, and phasing plan should be determined.

	(5) The topography, geology, rivers, harbors, roads, climate, population, historical customs, etc. of each city must be well understood, mastered, and adapted to develop its advantages and remedy its shortcomings.

	(6) Larger cities should consider setting up auxiliary cities (or satellite cities) to achieve the effect of regulation and division of labor. The original larger towns can be considered for conversion to cities for urban-rural connection.

	(7) All cultural and historical relics (including buildings, etc.) should not be demolished in principle unless it is absolutely necessary and with the permission of the person in charge of the competent department, and attention should be paid to their preservation and repair.

II. Points that should be paid attention to first when formulating urban construction plans:

	(1) Land necessary for military and transportation must be delineated first.

	(2) Zoning planning should be coordinated with all supply and demand and production and transportation, with each district able to adjust itself, or several districts able to help each other exchange as the main purpose.

	(3) Roads and rivers should be delineated as a system as soon as possible, and existing or improved means of transportation should be used as much as possible. In particular, waterways must be specially repaired, and the less filled, the better.

	(4) Waterway transportation should be coordinated with air and land transportation, and together with drinking water, water for use, irrigation, power generation, and sewers (including water for factories), it should become a complete set of plans. However, the order of priority should be distinguished, and implementation should be classified, phased, or zoned.

	(5) When the long-term plan (such as twelve years) has not been carried out, there must be emergency symptomatic treatment measures, adapting to local conditions and adapting to the times. One should not sit and wait for the arrival of the long-term vision without taking action. However, those measures should be based on not hindering the long-term plan.

The above two items have a total of twelve articles, and the reasons are not detailed. Urban planning is a complex task. In recent years, urban facilities in various places have suffered unknown losses of manpower, material resources, and financial resources due to inadequate planning or no planning. Because once the plan is implemented, modification will become costly. If the plan occasionally has omissions, or improper coordination, or improper sequence of work, strict supervision during implementation, or violations of specifications, the impact is so great and the remedy is so difficult that it is difficult to describe in a word. One cannot but be cautious at the beginning. There will be hundreds of cities in the country that should be planned, large and small. A slight mistake will result in knowable losses. Conversely, if planning and implementation are appropriate, it will contribute to the success of all construction, which is beyond the calculation of skill. I think the greatest increase in production and economy is this. I hope you will point out whether it is appropriate.

    怎样使城市建设符合增产节约原则
    叶恭绰谈制订城市规划时应注意的事项
    我同意毛主席周总理李富春副总理的讲话和报告。
    我觉得努力于第二个五年经济建设计划的今天，一切应由增产节约出发是正确的、扼要的。我月前在视察工作座谈，参加了城市建设组，因此我愿向大会提出城市建设中应该注意到的几项原则性的条件，以供有关部门的参考，或于增产节约，有些益处。
    自建国至今，几年之内，国内原有的乡镇，部分已扩大成市，原有的小城市，一般是人口增多变成大市，而旧日的大城市发展更为迅速。在这样的情况之下，城市建设规划的工作，已一天一天的更形重要而迫切。我政府业已设有高级专管机构和各级专管机构，足见筹谋已久，细密分工。但我国幅图广大，历史悠久，地区各别，民俗不同，虽有专管机构对所司职务研究精深，筹计详尽，以今日的建设发展，瞬息万变，人民的生活意志，逐日提高。一都一市的兴建，与千百年的居民作息有关，和千百年的政治经济结合。无远大计划，不能符合于将来的发展。无应急措施，不能满足于目前的需求。新建城市与扩展城市的基础不同，改建城市与整理城市的目的有别，这是大国而兼古老的中国所特有的复杂因素，给予了我国做都市建设规划工作者的困难工作。我们今日目击某些通都大市，遇到居民的迅速增加，交通的严重负荷，住房的日形缺乏，卫生的环境艰难，城市建设的经费支绌，不能适应市区的扩展，规划机构的心余力薄，难以对付呼吁的各方，矛盾的现象增多，统一的要求迫切。下面提出在制订城市建设规划之前，必须作好几项准备工作，及制订城市建设规划应先注意几点的两项建议，仅系一些纲领，不敢说绝无疏误，尚祈同人和专家加以指正。
    一、制订城市建设规划时必须准备的几项工作：
    （1）向有关部门（特别是军事和交通）征集与建设规划有关的资料和意见。
    （2）广泛搜集有关的档案、志书、图表、报告等。并广泛征求当地群众的意见。
    （3）制订建设规划，应由有关机关负责代表人参与。而由市人民委员会推举专任人员为秘书，担任综合、编制底稿工作。并须有各项专家分工合作。
    （4）每一城市，应分别其为新设的，抑旧有的。及今后目的：成为经济城市，抑文化城市，或二者相兼。并根据各项方针政策，而定出该城市的型式、及其分区、分类、分期的规划。
    （5）每一城市的地形、地质、河流、港湾、道路、气候、户口、历史风俗等，必须善为了解和掌握及适应，以发展其优点，补救其缺点。
    （6）凡较大的城市应考虑设立辅助市（或称卫星市）以收调剂分工之效。其原有较大的镇，可考虑改市，以为城乡联络之用。
    （7）凡文化历史有关的文物（包括建筑物等），除实不得已，经该管部门负责人许可外，原则上不得拆毁，并应注意保管和修护。
    二、制订城市建设规划应首先注意之点：
    （1）军事和交通必须的用地，应先行划出。
    （2）分区规划，应配合一切供需和产运，以每一区内，能自己调剂，或数区能互助交流为主。
    （3）道路河流，应尽先划定系统，并尽量利用固有或改良的交通工具，尤其水道须特别修治，愈少填塞愈好。
    （4）水道的运输，应配合空陆运输，并联同食水、用水、灌溉、发电、下水道等（用水包括工厂），成为整套计划。但应分别先后缓急，分类或分期、分区实行。
    （5）在远大规划（例如十二年）未进行时，须有应急治标办法，因地制宜，因时制宜，不应坐待远景到来，不加措置。但那些措置，以不妨碍远大规划为准。
    以上两项共十二条，其理由未及详述。城市规划，本系一件复杂工作，近年来各地城市设施，由于规划不周，或并无规划，以致损耗的人力、物力、财力、日力不知凡几。缘规划一经实施，再改即成劳费。如规划偶有疏漏，或配合不当，或工序失宜，实施时监督不严，或有违规格，其影响之大，补救之难，一言难尽，不能不慎之于始。全国应规划的城市，大小将以数百计，稍有失当，损耗可知，反之如规划和实施，皆得其宜，其有助于一切建设的成功，当非巧历所能计，我以为增产节约之大，莫要于此，是否有当，尚祈指教。
