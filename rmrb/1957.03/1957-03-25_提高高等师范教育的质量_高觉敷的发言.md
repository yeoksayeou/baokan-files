　　Improving the Quality of Higher Normal Education
　　Gao Juefu's Speech
　　I would like to offer some opinions on the role of higher normal education in the socialist construction of the motherland and the enrollment of higher normal schools this year. I respectfully request criticism and correction from all committee members and comrades.

　　Higher Normal Education is an Important Link in Education
　　Our country is undertaking unprecedented socialist construction. This work requires a variety of raw materials and machinery, as well as a variety of construction talents. Therefore, according to the provisions of the first Five-Year Plan, we are training construction talents in conjunction with national industrialization. Various types of universities and secondary specialized schools are the places for cultivating construction talents. Students in universities and secondary specialized schools come from senior high schools or junior high schools. Therefore, the quantity and quality of secondary school graduates can directly affect the quantity and quality of students in universities and secondary specialized schools, and indirectly affect the quantity and quality of national construction talents. Improving the quality of secondary schools and other secondary education depends on higher normal schools, because the task of higher normal schools is to train teachers for secondary schools, and they must "possess Marxist-Leninist ideology, a high level of cultural and scientific knowledge, specialized educational knowledge and skills, communist moral qualities, and wholeheartedly serve the people's education." Therefore, higher normal education is an important link in education. It can affect higher education, secondary school education, primary school education through normal schools, and pre-school education through pre-school normal schools. We comrades engaged in educational work in normal colleges and universities are determined to do a good job in this link under the leadership of the Party and government, and eagerly hope that all committee members and comrades will give guidance, supervision, and support.

　　The achievements and difficulties of primary education are temporarily not discussed due to time constraints. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the government and the efforts of teachers, our secondary education has made great achievements in recent years, providing new forces for social production and cultural undertakings, and also supplying a large number of qualified graduates for various universities. However, due to the rapid development of our construction undertakings, the progress of secondary education lags far behind the development of the situation. Regardless of which subject is taught, there are still many problems, especially in the teaching of classical literature, where the problems are even greater. For example, a secondary school teacher, when explaining the sentence "发愤忘食" (fā fèn wàng shí - engrossed in study to the point of forgetting to eat) in the Analects, said: "Confucius got so angry that he even forgot to eat." There are many other examples of misinterpretations in the teaching of other subjects, which need not be listed here. In short, how to improve the quality of secondary education is an important issue in current education, and in order to improve the quality of secondary education, from a long-term perspective, we must find ways to improve the quality of higher normal education.

　　The Study of Education and Teaching Methods Cannot Be Denied
　　Some people believe that the teaching problems in secondary education are not so much problems of teaching methods as problems of teaching content. If professional training is insufficient, how can good secondary school teaching be achieved with only teaching method training? This criticism deserves our attention; it points out the shortcomings of current higher normal education: the proportion of specialized courses is too small, and the professional knowledge of graduates is too poor and not rich enough. We are willing to humbly accept this criticism and, under the unified leadership of the Ministry of Education in the future, revise the teaching plan to increase the training in certain specialized courses to improve the scientific and cultural level of graduates. Others believe that it is not necessary to run normal colleges to train secondary school teachers, that is to say, teachers do not need to study education and teaching methods of different majors. This opinion fundamentally denies higher normal education. Since the establishment of higher normal schools in our country, the contradiction between specialized courses and educational subjects has not been well resolved. As it stands, the teaching of education still has the shortcomings of dogmatism. The teaching methods of various specialized courses have not received due attention. Teachers with higher levels are unwilling to teach teaching methods. We must face these shortcomings squarely, we must better integrate with the reality of secondary school education to overcome the dogmatic tendencies of education; at the same time, we must persuade higher-level teachers to take charge of the teaching methods of various specialized courses, link with practice, to improve the teaching quality of teaching methods. But if we say that teachers do not need to study education and teaching methods, or even suggest abolishing normal colleges, then I cannot agree. It should be pointed out that professional knowledge is of course important, but how to impart professional knowledge to students, how to guide students' learning, how to work as a class teacher, how to conduct ideological education for students, etc., all require special training. Why should graduates of higher normal schools possess specialized educational knowledge and skills? That is the reason. We should advocate vigorously improving higher normal education, but we must not throw out the baby with the bathwater and draw the conclusion of negating higher normal education.

　　Improve Student Quality and Establish Professional Ideology
　　Now I would like to talk about the enrollment of higher normal schools. In the past few years, the enrollment of normal colleges and universities has focused on graduates of normal schools and outstanding primary school teachers, supplemented by high school graduates. This approach is not very appropriate. Because recruiting normal school graduates can disrupt the professional ideology of students in normal schools. They all hope to go to higher education, and if they are assigned to be primary school teachers after graduation, it is inevitable that they will be upset. Secondly, recruiting outstanding primary school teachers also increases the difficulties in primary education and reduces the quality of primary education. This year, due to the increase in the number of high school graduates, the enrollment of normal colleges and universities can be changed to high school graduates as the main target. In addition to overcoming the above-mentioned difficulties, this can also improve the quality of new students. However, we must also anticipate that most high school graduates are unwilling to apply for normal colleges and universities, and it is not easy to establish their professional ideology after entering normal colleges and universities. Parents and people in the community rarely have a correct understanding of the importance of the profession of people's teachers, and it more or less affects the establishment and consolidation of the professional ideology of students in normal colleges and universities. A first-year student in the Chinese Language Department of Nanjing Normal College completed half a year of study, but because several of his relatives were doctors, he finally applied to withdraw from school and applied to medical school after the summer vacation. We repeatedly enlightened him, but to no avail. He insisted on taking the risk of failing the exam after the summer vacation and was unwilling to continue studying at Nanjing Normal University. Several years ago, there was also a student who was unwilling to wear the Nanjing Normal University badge when he left the school, so as not to be despised by relatives and friends. These people were influenced by the old society and did not realize that the career of people's teachers is highly valued in socialist countries. We know that the period when a person is most susceptible to educational influence is during adolescence. The education received by young people can determine the fate and future of the country. The country entrusts the great responsibility of educating young people to teachers, so the profession of teachers is noble, glorious, and arduous at the same time, and the spiritual comfort that teachers receive cannot be appreciated by anyone. Therefore, I hope that all committee members and comrades will appropriately encourage their children and the children of relatives and friends to apply for higher normal schools during the summer vacation. After they are admitted to higher normal schools, help us establish and consolidate their professional ideology, and hope that they will contribute all their strength to the people's education.

### 提高高等师范教育的质量　高觉敷的发言

　　提高高等师范教育的质量
　　高觉敷的发言
    我想就高等师范教育在祖国社会主义建设中的地位和今年高等师范学校的招生问题提出一些意见，敬请各位委员、各位同志予以批评和指正。
  　高等师范教育是教育中的重要环节
    我国正在进行史无前例的社会主义建设工作。这个工作需要多种多样的原料和机器设备，也需要多种多样的建设人才。所以根据第一个五年计划的规定，我们在进行国家工业化的同时相应地培养建设人才。各种类型的高等学校和中等专业学校就是培养建设人才的场所。高等学校、中等专业学校的学生来自高级中学或初级中学。因此，中学毕业生的数量和质量可以直接影响高等学校和中等专业学校学生的数量和质量，间接影响国家建设人才的数量和质量。而提高中学和其它中等学校的教育质量则有赖于高等师范学校，因为高等师范学校的任务是培养中等学校师资，而且是必须“具有马克思列宁主义思想观点、高度的文化科学水平、教育的专门知识和技能、共产主义的道德品质、全心全意为人民教育事业服务的中等学校师资。”所以高等师范教育是教育中一个重要环节，上可以影响高等教育，中可以影响中等学校教育，下还可以通过师范学校影响小学教育，通过幼儿师范学校影响幼儿教育。我们在师范院校担任教育工作的同志们决心要在党政领导下把这一环节搞好，热切地希望各位委员，各位同志予以指导、监督和支持。
    小学教育的成绩和困难，因为限于时间暂且不说。我们的中等教育，由于党和政府的正确领导和教师们的努力，这几年来取得了很大的成绩，为社会生产和文化事业输送了新生力军，也为各高等学校供应了大量的合格毕业生。但是由于我们的建设事业迅速发展，中学教育的进步，远落在形势发展的后面。无论那一个科目的教学，都还存在着不少的问题，特别是古典文学的教学，问题更大。譬如有一中学教师在解释论语中“发愤忘食”一句时说：“孔子生起气来，连饭都忘记了吃”。其他科目的教学也有不少的以讹传讹的事例，这里不必多举了。总之，怎样设法提高中等教育的质量，是当前教育中一个重要问题，而为了提高中等教育的质量，从长远的计划来说，我们必须设法提高高等师范教育的质量。
　  教育学科和教学法的学习不能加以否定
    有人认为目前中等教育的教学问题与其说是教学方法的问题，毋宁说是教学内容的问题。专业修养不够，单有教学方法的训练，怎样能够搞好中学教学呢？这个批评是值得我们重视的；它给我们指出了目前高等师范教育的缺点：就是专业课的比重太小，毕业生的专业知识太差，不够充实。我们愿意虚心接受这个批评，将来在教育部的统一领导之下，修改教学计划，加重某些专业课的训练，以提高毕业生的科学文化水平。还有人认为培养中学师资，不一定要办理师范院校，也就是说，作教师的不一定要学习教育学科和不同专业的教学法。这个意见就根本否定了高等师范教育。自从我国设立高等师范学校以来，专业课和教育学科的矛盾，一向得不到很好的解决。就目前说，教育学科的教学依旧存在着教条主义的缺点。各专业课的教学法没有受到应有的重视。水平较高的教师不愿意任教教学法。我们必须正视这些缺点，我们必须更好地结合中学教育的实际，以克服教育学科的教条主义的偏向；同时必须说服水平较高的教师担任各专业课的教学法，联系实际，以提高教学法的教学质量。但是如果说，教育学科和教学法等课，作教师的不必学习，或甚至于提出取消师范院校的意见，那我就不敢苟同了。应该指出，专业知识固然重要，但是如何把专业知识传授给学生，如何指导学生的学习，如何担任班主任工作，如何对学生进行思想教育等等，也都需要特殊的训练。高等师范学校毕业生为什么要具备教育的专门知识和技能呢？这就是它的理由。我们应该主张极力改进高等师范教育，却不得因噎废食，作出否定高等师范教育的结论。
  　提高学生质量树立专业思想
    现在我想顺便谈一谈高等师范学校的招生问题。过去几年来，师范院校招生以师范学校毕业生和小学的优秀教师为主要对象，而以高中毕业生来补充。这个办法是不很妥当的。因为招收师范毕业生可以打乱师范学校在校学生的专业思想。他们都希望升学了，毕业后如果被分配去担任小学教师就难免不闹情绪了。其次，招收小学优秀教师也增加了小学教育的困难，而降低了小学教育的质量。今年由于高中毕业生人数增加，师范院校招生可改以高中毕业生为主要对象。这除了克服上述困难外，还可以提高新生的质量。但是我们也不能不预料到高中毕业生多数不愿意投考师范院校，考入师范院校后，也不容易树立他们的专业思想。做家长的和社会人士对人民教师职业的重要性很少有正确的认识，也或多或少地影响师范院校学生的专业思想的树立和巩固。南京师范学院语文系一年级有一个学生，完成了半年的学习，但因亲戚有若干人是医生，终至于申请退学，暑假后投考医学院。我们反复开导，都没有效果。他硬要冒暑假后投考落第的危险，不愿意继续在南师肄业。几年前还有一个学生出校门时，不愿意佩带南师校徽，以免遭受到亲戚朋友的轻视。这些人受了旧社会的影响，不认识人民教师事业在社会主义国家内是很受重视的。我们知道一个人最容易接受教育影响的时期是在青少年的时期。青少年所受的教育可以决定国家的命运和国家的前途。国家以教育青年的重大责任付托给教师，所以教师的职业是崇高的，光荣的，同时也是艰巨的，教师所得到的精神安慰是谁也不能体会的。因此，我希望各位委员、各位同志适当地鼓励自己的子女和亲戚朋友的子女在暑假时投考高等师范学校。到了他们考入高师肄业后，帮助我们树立和巩固他们的专业思想，希望他们为人民教育事业贡献出自己的一切力量。（附图片）
