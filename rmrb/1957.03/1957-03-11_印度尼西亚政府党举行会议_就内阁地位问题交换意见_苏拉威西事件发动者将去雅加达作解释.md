Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 10th. The five Indonesian government parties held a meeting on March 9th. The meeting's spokesperson, Suwirjo, Chairman of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, told reporters that the purpose of the meeting was to enable the parties that still support the government to cooperate better in order to deal with the current problems. The meeting mainly exchanged views and did not make any decisions.

He said that each government party will soon send representatives to meet with President Sukarno. The President will express his views on the attitudes taken by the various political parties towards his plan and conduct consultations.

The five government parties are the Indonesian Nationalist Party, Nahdatul Ulama, the Islamic Union Party, the Christian Party, and the Catholic Party.

According to Antara News Agency, the main issue discussed at this government party meeting was the status of the cabinet. The Islamic Union Party firmly believes that the cabinet should be completely reorganized as soon as possible, while the Nationalist Party believes that the cabinet must continue to work until it returns its mandate.

According to the Indonesian Nationalist Party's "Indonesian Torch" newspaper yesterday, former Vice President Hatta has agreed to the National Council planned in Sukarno's proposal. At the same time, the Masyumi Party's "Eternal Daily" believes that Sukarno may agree that the Indonesian Communist Party will not participate in the coalition cabinet, but it will definitely participate in the National Council. The newspaper said that Sukarno had stated that if this compromise proposal is also rejected, he would require both the Masyumi Party and the Indonesian Communist Party not to participate in the cabinet. If the Masyumi Party is unwilling to participate in the National Council, that is its own business.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 10th. Lieutenant Colonel Piengaadi, Director of the Indonesian Army Intelligence Service, told reporters when he returned to Jakarta from Makassar on the afternoon of March 8th that Commander Sumual of the 7th Military Region is preparing to go to Jakarta to explain his actions in establishing a military government in Sulawesi on March 2nd.

The officer, who was ordered by the Army Staff to go to Makassar with Colonel Kretarto to investigate the Sulawesi incident on the spot, said that they had conveyed the order of the Army Chief of Staff, asking Commander Sumual of the 7th Military Region and Colonel Sudirman, Commander of the Sulawesi South and Southeast Region Pacification Command, to maintain the status quo and not make any changes to their organization. Prior to this, there were reports that the 7th Military Region was going to establish a "Unified Dispatch Command of South and Southeast Sulawesi" and that the nine battalions of troops under Sudirman's command would obey the military authorities in Makassar.

    印度尼西亚政府党举行会议
    就内阁地位问题交换意见
    苏拉威西事件发动者将去雅加达作解释
    新华社雅加达10日电　印度尼西亚五个政府党在3月9日举行了会议。会议发言人、国民党总主席苏维约对记者们说，这次会议的目的是要使仍然支持政府的各政党更好地合作，以便应付目前的问题。会议主要是交换意见，没有作出任何决定。
    他说，每个政府党不久将派代表去见苏加诺总统。总统将对各政党就他的方案所采取的态度发表意见，并且进行商谈。
    五个政府党是印度尼西亚国民党、伊斯兰教师联合会、伊斯兰联盟党、基督教党和天主教党。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，这次政府党会议所讨论的主要问题是内阁的地位问题，因为伊斯兰联盟党坚决认为应当尽快全面改组内阁，而国民党却认为，内阁在交回委任状以前必须继续工作。
    据印度尼西亚国民党的“印度尼西亚火炬报”昨天说，前副总统哈达已经同意苏加诺方案中计划成立的民族委员会。同时，马斯友美党的“永恒日报”认为，苏加诺可能同意印度尼西亚共产党不参加合作内阁，但它肯定要参加民族委员会。报纸说，苏加诺曾经表示，如果这个折衷建议也被拒绝的话，他就要求马斯友美党和印度尼西亚共产党都不参加内阁。如果马斯友美党也不愿参加民族委员会，那是它自己的事情。
    新华社雅加达10日电　印度尼西亚陆军情报处处长皮恩加迪中校3月8日下午从望加锡回到雅加达时告诉记者说，第七军区司令苏穆阿尔准备到雅加达解释他3月2日在苏拉威西建立军政府的行动。
    这个奉陆军参谋部的命令同克里塔托上校一起到望加锡去实地调查苏拉威西事件的军官说，他们已经传达了陆军首脑的命令，要第七军区司令苏穆阿尔中校和苏拉威西南部和东南部地区绥靖司命部司令苏狄曼上校维持现状，而不要对他们的组织作任何改变。在这以前，有消息说，第七军区要建立一个“苏拉威西南部和东南部统一调度司令部”，并且要苏狄曼指挥下的九个营军队服从望加锡的军事当局。
