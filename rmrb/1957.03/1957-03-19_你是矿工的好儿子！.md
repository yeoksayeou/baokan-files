“You are a good son of a miner!”
	Wulanhan

	The north wind howled, swirling the snow covering the ground. On this cold winter night, even the stars high in the sky seemed to tremble with cold. Only the children huddled in the courtyard, clamoring and frolicking, lighting fireworks and setting off firecrackers, joyfully celebrating the arrival of Lunar New Year's Eve.

	Someone's mother called out, "Come home for dumplings!" In the blink of an eye, the children scattered. Only Xiao Mei remained in the empty courtyard. He stared at his desolate and empty home, standing there for a long time. On this night, he acutely felt the sorrow of losing his mother. His father had told him in the morning to go to Auntie Mou's house in the evening to eat dumplings with Xiao Lanzi, but he refused to go now.

	"Xiao Mei, my mom wants you to come!" Xiao Lan had been peeking through the door and calling him for the third time.

	Xiao Mei didn't move or respond.

	After a while, Auntie Mou came out herself and led Xiao Mei into the house.

	"Auntie Mou, why isn't my dad back yet?"

	"Your dad is down the mine!" Auntie Mou said kindly, and to cheer Xiao Mei up, she added, "Your dad will come back with a little red flag!"

	In the past, Xiao Mei cared most about the little red flag for the competition, but today he had no interest. He was only concerned about: "Why isn't my dad back yet?" Auntie Mou saw what Xiao Mei was thinking.

	Auntie Mou didn't know what to say to make Xiao Mei understand the significance of working overtime to mine coal on New Year's Eve. Would he understand if she told him that the country needed a large amount of coal, and that the miners actively responded to the government's call? He's only eight years old! He will understand, he should understand, he is the son of a miner! Auntie Mou seemed to find a thread in the chaos. She thought further: Miners enthusiastically mine coal during the holidays, not asking for others' gratitude, but the children of miners must know their father's hard work. She stroked Xiao Mei's dark hair, speaking softly, slowly, as if weighing each word:

	"Our country and people are building socialism and need a lot of coal," she observed Xiao Mei's expression to see if he understood. She was afraid that her words would be misunderstood by the child and hurt his young heart, "Also for you, Xiao Mei, and for Xiao Lan, for all of us to live warmly and happily..."

	"Mom, I understand, my dad and Xiao Mei's dad are both Communist Party members..." Before Xiao Lanzi could finish speaking, her mother continued:

	"Never forget that our warmth and light are exchanged for your father's labor... especially when everyone is happy, we should think of them even more."

	For the first time in his life, Xiao Mei felt that the lamplight and coal fire were so kind and lovely.

	"I won't forget..." Xiao Mei's voice became hoarse, and he suddenly turned around and ran to the window. Xiao Lanzi only saw his two small shoulders twitching constantly.

	Outside the window, the north wind howled...

	The crackling of firecrackers shook the stillness of the night, and the off-duty miners said with a smile: This is the people congratulating and applauding them—the people who labored tonight. Only Xiao Mei's father, who was the last to emerge from the mine, was a little unhappy. He regretted that the little red flag had been taken back by the second group on New Year's Eve. What should I tell Xiao Mei when he asks? Xiao Mei might already be asleep, having sweet dreams right now. He lowered his head and trudged towards home. When he passed the small earth mound, he saw that familiar and beloved patch of light again. Every household was eating dumplings. Life was getting better and better, he seemed to be comforted and forgot about the little red flag.

	At that moment, a figure emerged from the darkness opposite, but disappeared immediately. He immediately became vigilant. Who dares to disrupt our life today while we are celebrating the holiday! He still vividly remembered the scene of his parents' tragic deaths twenty years ago, and the days when he was beaten and bullied. Only seven years ago did he start living like a human being, and this life cannot be allowed to be disrupted by anyone again.

	"Who's there?" he shouted loudly. No one answered. He pounced over like a tiger breaking through a fence. Someone was squatting by the roadside, and when he got closer, he couldn't even believe his eyes, it was Xiao Mei! Xiao Mei was standing there, draped in his ragged cotton-padded coat, the hem of which almost dragged on the snow.

	He was really angry, why wasn't he sleeping in the middle of the night? He grabbed Xiao Mei's shoulder.

	"Xiao Mei, what are you doing out here?"

	Whether it was his father's yelling that scared him, or the cold wind that was blowing, Xiao Mei was trembling all over. There was no fear on Xiao Mei's face. His watery eyes were fixed on his father's face.

	"Dad, I brought you dumplings!"

	Xiao Mei's father suddenly felt that his son had grown up. He squatted down on one leg and hugged Xiao Mei in his arms with a pair of strong, coal-stained hands, pressing Xiao Mei's red little face tightly against his own cheek.

	"You are a good son of a miner!"

	From under the hem of his cotton coat, Xiao Mei carefully held out a bowl of dumplings and brought it to his father's mouth... (Attached picture)

    “你是矿工的好儿子！”
    乌兰汉
    北风嗖嗖地呼啸着，卷扬起复盖在地面上的雪花。在这寒冷的冬夜，好像连高悬在空中的星星也冻得一味打颤。只有孩子们簇拥在庭院里，喧嚷、打闹，点烟火、放鞭炮，欢欢喜喜地庆贺除夕的降临。
    不知是谁的母亲唤了一声：“回家吃饺子了！”一眨眼的工夫，孩子们都跑散了。庭院里只剩下小煤一个人。他望着空寂无人的家，伫立了好久。在今天夜里，他尖锐地体会到失去母亲的悲哀。爸爸早晨告诉过他，让他晚上到牟大娘家里去跟小兰子一道吃饺子，可是他现在却不肯去。
    “小煤，我妈叫你来呢！”小兰已经扒着门缝喊了第三遍。
    小煤没有动，也没有应声。
    过了一会儿，牟大娘亲自跑了出来，把小煤领进屋里去了。
    “牟大娘，我爸爸怎么还不回来？”
    “你爸爸下矿了！”牟大娘亲切地说，为了让小煤高兴，她又补了一句：“你爸爸会带着小红旗回来的！”
    往日小煤最关心的是竞赛小红旗，今天他没兴趣了，他只惦记着：“我爸爸怎么还不回呢？”牟大娘看出了小煤的心思。
    牟大娘不知道应该怎样对他说才能让小煤理解除夕加班采煤的意义。告诉他说国家需要大批的煤，说矿工们积极地响应了政府的号召，小煤会懂吗？他才八岁呀！会懂的，他应该懂，他是矿工的儿子！牟大娘好像从乱麻当中找到一根头。她又想下去：矿工们在节日里热情地采煤，不要求别人感激，但是，矿工的儿女，不能不知道爸爸的劳苦。她摸抚着小煤的乌黑的头发，轻声地、缓慢地、好像称量每一个字似地开了口：
    “咱们国家和人民在建设社会主义，需要很多的煤，”她观察小煤的表情，看他是否懂得了。她唯恐自己的话被孩子理解错了，刺伤了他那幼小的心灵，“同时为了你，小煤，也为了小兰，为了咱们大家都过得暖暖和和、快快乐乐……”
    “妈妈，我懂，我爸爸和小煤的爸爸都是共产党员……”没等小兰子说完，母亲又接着讲自己的话了：
    “什么时候也不要忘记，咱们的温暖和光亮是你爸爸他们的劳动换来的……特别是大家欢乐的时候，更应当想着他们。”
    小煤有生以来第一次感觉到灯光和煤火是那么亲切可爱。
    “我忘不了……”小煤的声音变得沙哑了，他突然扭转身子，跑向窗前。小兰子只看到他的两个小小肩膀在不断地抽动。
    窗外，北风嗖嗖地呼啸着……
    毕剥的爆竹声震荡着夜的静穆，下班的矿工们逗笑地说：这是人民向他们——今宵劳动的人们——道喜和鼓掌。唯独最后走出矿井的小煤的父亲，却有些不愉快。他悔恨小红旗在除夕里被第二组给夺回去了。小煤问我怎么回答呢？小煤也许已经睡了，现在正做甜美的梦。他低着头蹒跚地向回家的路走去。路过小土岗时，他又看见了那么熟悉、那么心爱的一片灯火。家家户户都在吃饺子。生活眼看着越来越好，他像是得到了安慰，忘却了小红旗。
    就在这一刹那，从对面的黑暗中涌现出一个人影来，但马上又消逝了。他立刻警惕起来。谁敢趁着我们过节的时候来破坏我们今天的生活！二十年前父母惨死的景象，自己挨打受欺的日子，他记忆犹新。只是七年前才过起了人的生活，这生活不允许任何人再来破坏。
    “谁？”他大声喊道。没有人回答。他像一条冲破围栏的猛虎扑了过去。一个人蹲在路旁，当他逼近时，他甚至不敢相信自己的眼睛了，是小煤！小煤站在那里，披着他的破棉袄，袄襟一直快拖到雪地上。
    他真有些生气，为什么三更半夜不睡觉？他一把抓住了小煤的肩膀。
    “小煤，你出来干什么？”
    不知是父亲的吆喝吓的，还是寒风吹的，小煤全身在颤抖。小煤的脸上并没有丝毫的恐惧。他那双水汪汪的大眼睛，直盯着爸爸的脸。
    “爸，我给你送饺子来了！”
    小煤的爸爸忽然觉得自己的儿子长大了。他蹲下一条腿去，用一双粗壮的、染满煤灰的手把小煤搂在怀里，把小煤通红的小脸蛋紧紧贴在自己的腮上。
    “你是矿工的好儿子！”
    小煤从棉袄的底襟下，小心地托出一碗饺子来，送到爸爸的嘴边上……。（附图片）
