Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, March 18th: On March 16th, the artillery troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed on the Huangqi Peninsula in northeastern Fujian twice shelled the Chiang Kai-shek forces to protect fishing boats.

　　At 10:40 AM on March 16th, just as more than 100 fishing boats from the Huangqi area sailed out of the harbor to fish, several artillery positions of the Chiang Kai-shek troops on the Matsu Islands fiercely bombarded these fishing boats. Our artillery troops immediately provided covering fire, suppressing the Chiang Kai-shek artillery positions and allowing the fishing boats to safely return to port. Two hours before this artillery battle, when three of our fishing boats were fishing in the sea near Chuanshi Island, east of the Minjiang River estuary, three Chiang Kai-shek motorized boats approached the fishing boats in an attempt to intercept them. Our artillery troops quickly opened fire, protecting the fishing boats to continue fishing.

    黄岐半岛上炮兵
　　掩护渔船捕鱼
    新华社福建前线18日电　16日，驻守福建东北部黄岐半岛上的中国人民解放军炮兵部队为掩护渔船捕鱼，两次用炮打击蒋军。
    16日上午十时四十分，黄岐地区出海捕鱼的一百多艘渔船刚驶出港湾，马祖列岛上蒋军的几个炮兵阵地向这些渔船猛烈轰击。我炮兵部队立刻进行掩护射击，把蒋军炮兵阵地的炮火压住，使渔船安全返回渔港。在这次炮战之前两小时，我三艘渔船在闽江口以东川石岛附近海面捕鱼时，蒋军汽艇三艘窜近渔船企图拦劫，我炮兵部队迅速开炮，掩护渔船继续捕鱼。
