Xinhua News Agency, March 19th, London Dispatch: British Prime Minister Macmillan stated on the evening of the 18th at a Conservative Party rally held in Leicester that the purpose of the US-British heads of government meeting in Bermuda was to “eliminate any differences between the US and Britain and restore the Anglo-American relationship as a cornerstone of world peace.”

He said that the talks would cover “many things,” and in this regard, he first mentioned the situation in the Middle East. He said, “The situation in the Middle East is bleak and dangerous.” He was compelled to acknowledge the real cause of the tension in the Middle East. He said: “Given the value of oil resources and the impact that chaos in the Middle East could have on European economic life, greedy eyes are regarding these (Middle Eastern) countries as a target for contention.”

Macmillan mentioned the issue of maintaining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He said that the Bermuda talks must also discuss “some new movements towards European economic cooperation and their place within the scope of growing world trade,” and must also discuss “some Far Eastern issues that are very important to British interests and to the interests of our Commonwealth friends – Australia and New Zealand.”

    麦克米伦谈美英会谈
    据新华社19日讯　伦敦消息：英国首相麦克米伦18日晚间在列斯特举行的一次保守党集会上说，美英政府首脑百慕大会谈的目的是“消除美英之间的任何分歧和恢复作为世界和平基石的英美关系”。
    他说，这次会谈要谈“许多事情”，在这方面，他首先提到了中东的局势。他说：“中东的局势黯淡而危险。”他不得不承认造成中东紧张局势的真正原因。他说： “鉴于石油资源的价值和中东混乱可能对欧洲经济生活产生的影响，贪婪的眼睛正在把这些（中东）国家看作一个争夺的目标。”
    麦克米伦提到了维持北大西洋集团的问题。他说，百慕大会谈还必须讨论“走向欧洲经济合作的一些新运动和它们在日益增长的世界贸易范围内的地位”，也必须讨论 “一些对英国利益和我们的联邦朋友——澳大利亚和新西兰的利益来说非常重要的远东问题”。
