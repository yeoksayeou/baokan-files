    Visiting Mengulas Village
    ——Albanian Correspondence
  　Fan Chengzuo
    The highway is like an endlessly long ribbon, winding across the Korçë Plain. The driver comrade pointed ahead and said to us, "Cross that small river, and you can see Mengulas Village."

    To our left was a field, and beyond the field, a low mountain range parallel to the highway, which is the border between Albania and Greece. To the right was a patch of uneven mounds and grassland, where herds of cattle and sheep were resting.

    As we were admiring the scenery, two children suddenly ran out of the flock, shouting towards the village, "The Chinese comrades are here!"

    As soon as we arrived at the village, we saw groups of people waiting for us in the setting sun. Red flags were hung everywhere in the village, and loudspeakers broadcasted the slogan "Long live Albanian-Chinese friendship."

    The wave of jubilation shifted from the village entrance to the square. Everyone in the village was extremely happy that our Chinese students were going to visit and stay overnight here. The square was filled with the sounds of musical instruments, songs, and dance steps. Ten elderly people, aged sixty or seventy, even specially performed Albanian folk dances for us, which was particularly touching.

    Afterwards, we visited Mengulas Village accompanied by a large group of cooperative members. The members spoke one after another, vying to introduce us to everything they were proud of, leaving our ears overwhelmed. I only heard: "These twenty-eight new houses were built after the cooperative was established," "This is the large warehouse with nine rooms that is about to be completed," "A cinema will be built here," "This is the primary school, which will soon be expanded into a seven-year primary school." As we walked and talked, the sound of rushing water gradually drowned out people's voices. The farmers had already brought us to their small hydroelectric power station. It seemed that this hydroelectric power station was very simple, with a canal about several kilometers long leading to the Shkumbin River, and a small tile-roofed house in a low-lying area, where water poured down from above like a waterfall. There were only two people in the room taking turns managing the power station's machines. Many villages in Albania have established this kind of small hydroelectric power station, which costs little and works well.

    When the night fell over the hills and plains, and the entire village was brightly lit, the Mengulas Village Agricultural Cooperative held a grand reception in a newly built hall to entertain us. We were amazed by the sumptuousness of the dinner, and the large plates of honey alone were enough for us to eat for a week. But the hospitality of the hosts was sweeter than honey. The Party Secretary of the cooperative compared our friendship to sweet dew.

    We were settled in a farmer's home, and the hostess gave us a room that her son originally lived in. Her son had just graduated from the Tirana Agricultural Technical School and had now been decided to be sent to study in the Soviet Union. This mother, who loved her farm and her children, said to us: "We are farmers who are born and raised here, and we also want our children to study agriculture." As she said this, a satisfied smile spread across the wrinkles on her face.

    In this clean room, three elderly people around the age of seventy, who accompanied us, sat on the floor according to their custom and told us about their bitter past and happy present.

    The farmers of Mengulas Village, like all the working people of Albania, had suffered from pain and poverty for generations. Hunger had once forced them to leave their homes and wander to faraway places like the United States, Egypt, and Italy to earn a living by selling their labor. Before liberation, as many as three-quarters of the men in Mengulas Village were wandering abroad. They often reluctantly left their young wives shortly after marriage, sold everything in the house that could be sold, and embarked on a vast and unknown future. They often returned to their poor hometowns empty-handed when they were old and weak. Some people disappeared without a trace after they left and never returned.

    This was the situation in Mengulas Village in the past. Among the three elderly people in the conversation, two had personally experienced the pain of wandering, and they were witnesses to the past full of blood and tears.

    But those days finally passed. The Albanian people found a way out in the struggle. They took up guns, and under the leadership of the Albanian Communist Party (now the Labor Party), liberated themselves, liberated the motherland, drove away the foreign occupiers, eliminated the feudal forces, and began to build their own homes on the ruined rubble. Especially in 1948, the establishment of the agricultural cooperative in Mengulas Village was the beginning of a happy life for the farmers in the village.

    In the past eight years, the face of Mengulas Village has completely changed. We can see this change from the following figures. When the cooperative was first established, only twenty-two households joined, with fifty-four hectares of land, nine sheep, and four cows, and nothing else; but today there are one hundred and eight households, three hundred and thirty hectares of land, three hundred and eighty sheep, sixty-two cows, thirty horses, one hundred and eighty pigs, and a large truck was bought not long ago. The once lifeless Mengulas Village has now become very active. The entire village has organized a sixty-five-member choir, conducted by Party Secretary Hadaer Bijie, and has also organized a drama group and a dance team. Recently, Mengulas Village won the first prize in the rural area in the cultural and artistic performance in the entire state.

    In response to the call of the Party Central Committee to strive to overfulfill the Second Five-Year Plan, the cooperative members of Mengulas Village promised to increase production. This is the loud voice of the farmers of Mengulas Village who have already mastered their own destiny.

    The three old men talked tirelessly, and their excited eyes were filled with tears. They said, "National liberation freed us from oppression; the establishment of the cooperative freed us from poverty." They finally added: "Farmers without cooperatives are like children without mothers."

    Early the next morning, we left Mengulas Village with reluctance. The Party Secretary held our hands and said, "Please convey our cordial friendship to the great Chinese people and tell the Chinese farmer brothers who are advancing on the road of cooperativization!"

    The sun reddened the hills, and at this time we saw that the fields were already full of hard-working farmers. The car moved slowly, and we waved goodbye to the farmers of Mengulas Village. The morning breeze brought their blessings: "Wish you a safe journey! Come again next time!"

    访门古拉斯村
    ——阿尔巴尼亚通讯
  　范承祚
    公路像一条无尽长的带子，蜿蜒在科尔察平原上。司机同志指着前面对我们说：“越过那条小河，就可以看到门古拉斯村了。”
    我们左边是一片田野，田野那边一条和公路平行的矮山，就是阿尔巴尼亚和希腊的边界线。右边是一片高低不平的土墩和草地，成群的牛羊在那里休息。
    当我们正在观看景色的时候，忽然从羊群里跑出来两个孩子，向村内高喊着：“中国同志来啦。”
    一到村里，就看见成群结队的人在斜阳下等着我们。全村到处张挂着红旗，扩音器播送着“阿中友谊万岁”的呼声。
    欢腾的浪潮从村口转向广场。全村的人都因我们中国留学生要在这里参观和过夜而欢欣异常。广场上弥漫着乐器声、歌声和舞步声。有十位六、七十高龄的老人还特地为我们跳了阿尔巴尼亚的民间舞，特别令人感动。
    随后，我们在一大群合作社社员的陪同下参观门古拉斯村。社员们你一言我一语，争着向我们介绍他们引为骄傲的一切，使我们的耳朵应接不暇。我只听到：“这边二十八幢新房子是合作化以后建的”，“这就是即将落成的有九间房子的大仓库”，“这里将要修建电影院”，“这里是初小，就要扩大成七年制小学了。”边说边走，渐渐地，水流奔泻的声音淹没了人们的语声。农民们已经把我们带到他们的小型水电站来了。看起来这个水电站很简单，有一条通向夕固滨河的长约数公里的水渠，在一个低凹的地方有座小瓦房，水从上面像瀑布一样倾泻下来。室内只有两个人在轮流管理发电站的机器。阿尔巴尼亚的很多乡村，都建立了这种花钱不多而效用很好的小型水电站。
    当夜幕铺上了山岗和平原，整个村子灯火齐明的时候，门古拉斯村农业合作社为了招待我们，在一座新建的大厅里举行了盛大的酒会。晚餐菜肴的丰盛使我们感到惊奇，光是大盘的蜂蜜，就足够我们吃一个星期。但是好客的主人的心意比蜜还要甜，合作社的党书记把我们的友谊比作甘露。
    我们被安顿在一个农民的家里，女主人把她儿子原住的一个房间让给我们住。她儿子刚毕业于地拉那农业技术学校，现在已被决定派到苏联去留学。这位热爱农家和自己孩子的母亲对我们说：“我们根生土长是农民，我们叫自己的孩子也学农。”在说这话的时候，满意的笑容展开了她脸上的皱纹。
    在这个整洁的房间内，陪伴我们的三位七十岁上下的老人，按照他们的习惯席地而坐，向我们谈起了他们辛酸的过去和幸福的现在。
    门古拉斯村的农民同阿尔巴尼亚全体劳动人民一样，过去世世代代受着痛苦和贫困的折磨。饥饿曾经逼得他们背井离乡，到遥远的美国、埃及、意大利等地去流浪，以出卖自己的劳力谋生活。解放前，门古拉斯村的男人在外流浪的竟达全村男人的四分之三。他们往往在婚后不久，就忍痛丢下了年轻的妻子，变卖了家中一切可能变卖的东西，走上茫茫的前途。他们往往在年老力衰的时候，又空着双手回到了贫穷的家乡。还有些人出去以后，音信全无，永远不再回来了。
    这就是门古拉斯村过去的情景。谈话的这三位老人当中，有两人曾亲身经历过流浪的痛苦，他们是充满血泪的往事的见证人。
    但是，那样的日子终于过去了，阿尔巴尼亚人民在斗争中找到了出路。他们拿起了枪，在阿尔巴尼亚共产党（即现在的劳动党）的领导下，解放了自己，解放了祖国，赶走了外国占领者，消灭了封建势力，在残破的废墟上开始建立自己的家园。特别是在1948年，门古拉斯村建立了农业合作社，这是全村农民走向幸福生活的开始。
    八年来，门古拉斯村的面貌完全改观了。我们可以从下面几个数字看到这种变化。当合作社刚成立时候，入社的只有二十二户、五十四公顷地、九只羊和四头牛，其他什么也没有了；而今天却是一百零八户，三百三十公顷土地，三百八十只羊，六十二头牛，三十匹马，一百八十只猪，不久以前又买了一辆大卡车。以前死气沉沉的门古拉斯村，现在变得十分活跃了。全村组织了一个六十五人的合唱团，党书记哈达尔·比介里担任指挥，还组织了戏剧组和舞蹈队。最近在全州的文娱会演中，门古拉斯村赢得了农村的一等奖。
    为了响应党中央关于争取超额完成第二个五年计划的号召，门古拉斯村的合作社社员们保证增加生产。这是已经掌握了自己的命运的门古拉斯村农民的响亮的声音。
    三位老人不倦地谈着，他们激动的眼睛里噙着泪水。他们说：“全国解放使我们摆脱了压迫；合作社成立才使我们摆脱了贫困。”他们最后又补充道：“农民没有合作社，就像孩子没有亲娘。”
    第二天一早，我们就怀着依依不舍的心情离开了门古拉斯村。党书记握着我们的手说：“请把我们亲切的友谊转达给伟大的中国人民，告诉正在合作化道路上前进的中国农民兄弟！”
    太阳照红了山岗，这时我们看到田野上已经到处是辛勤劳动的农民。汽车徐徐行进，我们向门古拉斯村的农民们挥手告别，晨风送来了他们的祝福：“祝一路平安！下次再来啊！”
