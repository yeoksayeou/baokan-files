The state-owned canal systems in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province have begun spring repairs and spring irrigation work. The Jinghui, Luohui, and other canals have convened irrigation committee meetings in the irrigation areas to specifically study the spring irrigation work. As of February 23, the Jinghui Canal had basically completed the spring repair project for the main and branch canals, and then began releasing water for spring irrigation. The Luohui Canal has also begun releasing water. The spring irrigation sequence is prepared to first irrigate the cotton fields reserved last winter that have not been irrigated, and then irrigate the wheat fields. The Fuping People's Canal will soon be able to complete the spring irrigation of cotton fields in the irrigation area.
