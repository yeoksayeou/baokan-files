Industrial enterprise department personnel and technical personnel in Wuxi City are actively carrying out technical and management business mutual aid and learning activities in the campaign to increase production and practice economy. At present, in the textile and silk reeling systems, 64 pairs have formally signed technical mutual aid contracts, and 28 groups with a total of more than 300 people have carried out collective special technical research.

　　Through mutual aid and learning activities, Qingfeng Textile Factory engineer Huang Jinchun will help technician Yao Meilun reach the level of an engineer within three to five years. Ding Xilin, deputy director and director of the technical department of Silk Reeling Factory No. 3, will teach Feng Bangjun, the leader of the sample group, his decades of experience in compiling factory-wide operation plans within three months. Fan Chengsong, the dispatcher who is over sixty years old, also actively teaches the dispatcher Lu Junchu all the scheduling experience from the raw material entering the warehouse to the finished silk leaving the factory.

　　无锡市企业科室人员开展互助活动
    据新华社南京29日电  无锡市工业企业科室人员和技术人员在增产节约运动中，积极开展技术和管理业务的互助互学活动。目前，纺织和缫丝两个系统，正式签订技术互助合同的已经有六十四对，开展集体的专题技术研究的有二十八个小组共三百多人。
    通过互助互学活动，庆丰纺织厂工程师黄锦春要在三年到五年内，帮助技术员姚梅伦达到工程师的水平。缫丝三厂副厂长兼技术室主任丁锡麟，要在三个月内把自己几十年积累的一套编制全厂性作业计划的经验，教给试样组组长冯邦俊。已满六十高龄的调度长范成松也积极把从原料进仓到成档丝出厂的调度工作经验，全部教给调度员陆均初。
    技术和管理业务的互助互学活动开展以后，对于解决当前增产节约运动中的技术改进和加强生产管理，有很大好处。在技术互助活动中，也进一步加强了知识分子出身的技术员和工人出身的技术员之间的团结。
