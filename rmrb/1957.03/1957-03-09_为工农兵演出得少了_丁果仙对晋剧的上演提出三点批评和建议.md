I listened to Premier Zhou’s report, Vice Premier Li’s report, and Vice Chairman Chen’s report on the work of the CPPCC Standing Committee, and I completely agree with and support them.

As a Jin Opera actress, I would like to discuss some aspects of theatrical work:

I. Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend.
	We have many local opera genres in Shanxi, but they have been ravaged and destroyed by the reactionary rulers of the old society, and many genres have disappeared. For example, Shanxi Northern Road Clapper Opera, which used to be a very popular genre, was destroyed and eliminated after the Japanese invaders entered Shanxi and had not been performed for a long time. Since the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," old actors have been gathered to restore this genre. First, a troupe was established in Xinzhou, northern Shanxi, and recently it is planned to develop another troupe in Datong. Now there are forty-three opera genres in the province, and each genre has blossomed and borne fruit, with different developments. Under the leadership of the Party and the auspices of the government, various genres have held joint performances, observed each other's performances, exchanged experiences, and learned from each other's strengths. The troupes from Taiyuan perform in various places, and the troupes from various places also perform in Taiyuan. Through such exchanges and learning, we can know which genre and which repertoire can play a certain role among the masses. Therefore, the quality of performances has gradually improved. In terms of performance, there is the effect of bringing forth new ideas from the old. Different debates have also taken place in music. The goal of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is to better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve socialist construction. However, we all have shortcomings in this regard. For example, in 1956, the performance situation of the troupes in Taiyuan was as follows: 360 performances for basic construction sites, factories, and mines; 88 performances for the troops; 225 performances for the countryside; 1,561 performances in theaters in the city; and 786 performances in theaters outside the city. A total of 3,020 performances were given throughout the year, with 673 performances for workers, peasants, and soldiers, only a little over one-fifth. This shows that we are not going deep enough into the worker-peasant-soldier areas, and we should pay more attention to this aspect in the future.

II. Increase production and practice thrift, perform diligently and frugally.
	Some of our troupes have a tendency to be extravagant. Every time they rehearse a new play, they like to win with lighting and scenery, spending a lot of money. But when they perform in the countryside, factories, and mines, they cannot carry many props, the stage is too small to accommodate them, and they cannot perform without lighting. Although they have spent a lot of money and effort, they encounter difficulties when going to the countryside and cannot go deep into the masses. In the future, we must streamline and save, perform diligently and frugally. In addition to publicizing the political task of increasing production and practicing thrift and building the country diligently and frugally through drama, we must also work hard on political, ideological, and artistic aspects, improve quality, and perform dramas well without extravagance and waste.

III. Unite veteran artists and cultivate the younger generation.
	In 1956, according to the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, bringing forth the new through the old" the work of unearthing traditional repertoires was carried out. In the process of excavation, the veteran artists played an active role. From the restoration of traditional programs and the excavation of art, the young actors changed their ideas of disrespecting the old artists. The old conventions and precepts in dramatic performing arts were broken. Literary and art cadres humbly solicited opinions from veteran artists on sorting out and adapting. When restoring and performing the excavated old plays, we carefully studied them and relied on the cultural departments to sort out, adapt, and enrich the performance programs. Our 43 opera genres in Shanxi have unearthed 1,837 traditional programs, including 668 Jin Operas. According to preliminary classification, this includes 232 programs that have not been performed for a long time and are about to be lost, 269 programs that have titles but no scripts, and 167 scripts of generally popular programs. At the same time of excavation, the Jin Opera Troupes No. 1, 2, and 3 in Taiyuan restored and performed 71 programs. This is a general overview of the excavation and enrichment of the performing repertoire. We feel that these tasks are still not done well enough, and we will continue to excavate in the future.

	We also feel that cultivating young actors is an important task. If we do not make special efforts to cultivate them, young actors will be difficult to grow. As for the training methods, we are considering forming a young actors' detachment for touring performances, so that they can gradually be cultivated into excellent actors. We also plan to change the Jin Opera training class into a regular Jin Opera school, so that Jin Opera young actors can be constantly produced and inherited.

	Finally, I would like to learn from the brother opera genres across the country, contact each other, support each other, and better serve socialist construction.

	I wish the conference a successful conclusion!

	I wish all the committee members good health! (Attached picture)

### 为工农兵演出得少了  丁果仙对晋剧的上演提出三点批评和建议

    为工农兵演出得少了
    丁果仙对晋剧的上演提出三点批评和建议
    我听了周总理的报告、李副总理的报告，以及陈副主席政协常务委员会的工作报告，我完全同意并拥护。
    我是一个晋剧演员，愿就戏剧工作方面谈一谈：
    一、百花齐放，百家争鸣
    我们山西地方剧种很多，但是受旧社会的反动统治者摧残破坏，许多剧种都湮没下去了。例如：山西北路梆子，本是一个流行很久的剧种，日寇侵入山西后，被摧残消灭，久不上演，自从党中央提出百花齐放，百家争鸣之后，收罗旧有的演员，恢复了这个剧种，先在晋北忻县建立了一个剧团，最近拟在大同又发展一个剧团。现在全省共有四十三个剧种，各剧种都已开花结果，各有不同的发展。各剧种曾经在党的领导之下，在政府的主持之下，互相会演，互相观摩，交流经验，各取所长。太原的剧团到各地演出，各地的剧团也到太原演出，经过这样的交流学习，就能够知道那个剧种，那个剧目在群众中能起一定的作用。因此，演出质量逐渐提高。在演出方面即有推陈出新的效果。在音乐方面也发生了不同的争论。百花齐放，百家争鸣的目标，是更便于为工农兵服务，为社会主义建设服务。但是我们对此都有缺点，例如：1956年太原市的剧团演出情形，为基本建设工地、厂矿演出三百六十场，为部队演出八十八场，为农村演出二百二十五场，市内剧场演出一千五百六十一场，市外剧场演出七百八十六场，全年共演出三千零二十场，为工农兵演出六百七十三场，只五分之一多。这就说明我们深入工农兵方面还不够，今后对此方面要加注意。
    二、增产节约，勤俭演戏
    我们有些剧团，发生一种偏向，好铺张，每排演一个新剧，好以灯光布景取胜，花钱很多，但是到乡村和厂矿演出的时候，道具很多带不动，舞台小放不下，没有灯光演不成，虽然花了许多的钱，费了好多的力，但下乡却发生了困难，不能深入群众。今后我们要精简节约，勤俭演戏，除通过戏剧，宣传精简节约，勤俭建国这一政治任务外，还要在政治性、思想性、艺术性方面下工夫，把质量提高，不铺张浪费把戏剧演好。
  三、团结老艺人，培养青年一代
    1956年根据“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针，进行了发掘传统剧目工作，在发掘当中，老艺人们发挥了积极因素，从恢复上演传统节目，发掘艺术上，改变了青年演员对老艺人不尊重的思想。打破了戏剧表演艺术上的清规戒律。文艺干部很虚心地向老艺人征求整理改编意见。对发掘出来的老戏，在恢复上演时，我们经过慎重研究，依靠文化部门进行整理改编，丰富了上演节目。我们山西四十三个剧种，发掘出来传统节目一千八百三十七个，其中晋剧有六百六十八个，据初步分类，此中包括久不上演和将要失传的二百三十二个，有剧名而没找到剧本的有二百六十九个，还发掘出一般流行节目的剧本一百六十七个，并在发掘的同时，太原市的晋剧一、二、三团恢复上演了七十一个，这是关于发掘丰富上演剧目的概略的情况。这些工作我们感到做的还差，今后还要继续发掘。
    我们又感觉培养青年演员是一个重要工作，如果不特别培养，青年演员难以成长。至于培养方法，我们考虑成立青年演员支队，巡回演出，这样逐渐能培养成为优秀演员。又计划把晋剧训练班改为正规的晋剧学校，以便晋剧青年演员不断的产生，可以继承下来。
    最后，我愿意向全国的兄弟剧种学习，互相联系，互相支援，更好地为社会主义建设而服务。
    祝大会胜利成功！
    各位委员身体健康！（附图片）
