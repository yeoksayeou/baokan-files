    Cannot Wait Passively
    Wen Tianshen
    Currently, some factory leaders in Liaoning are still hesitant to mobilize the masses of workers to launch a production increase and economy campaign. Some leaders believe that the state's plan has not been finalized, and raw materials are not secured. If the masses are mobilized, wouldn't the situation of raw material supply falling short of demand become even more tense? Some leaders estimate that this year's tasks are insufficient. Although they have taken on some odd jobs in advance, they are worried about not having their own materials and dare not mobilize the masses to carry out production preparation work. In individual factories, a situation has even formed where "the head of the section goes to Beijing to ask for materials, the deputy section head is worried and just shouts, the purchasing agent has nothing to do at home, and the warehouse keeper sleeps in the warehouse."
    In fact, although this year's state plan has not been finalized, the State Council issued this year's planned control figures in December last year, and the competent ministries and regions have arranged the production for the first quarter based on these figures. Many industrial and mining enterprises are mobilizing the masses of workers to launch production increase and economy campaigns based on these arrangements and their own situations. The Shenyang Fan Factory is one of them.
    In January, the leaders of the Shenyang Fan Factory found that the production was short of more than 150 tons of iron plates, 70% of wood, and also lacked coke, rollers, and motors. They explained these key problems in production to the masses of workers and mobilized departments and workshops to analyze the economic activities of 1956. As a result, in the material cost item alone, the masses found more than 300 cases of material waste. The leadership promptly summarized the opinions of the masses into 21 production technology topics, organized veteran workers, department technicians, etc. to form special groups for research, and mobilized the masses to discuss, supplement and revise. For some major production and enterprise transformation issues, the factory director also consulted Soviet experts or professors from the Northeast University of Finance and Economics. In this way, the factory not only arranged the production for the first quarter, but also formulated this year's production technology organization measures plan, and launched a production increase and economy campaign.
    In the discussion of the technical organization measures plan, 279 of the 484 rationalization proposals put forward by the workers were adopted. Engineering and technical personnel also put forward 166 suggestions for improving product design and technology. In this way, many difficult problems in past production have been largely resolved satisfactorily. For example, the factory lacked fuel, and the workers proposed using a reverberatory furnace to burn coal instead of coke, and also promoted the advanced experience of burning coal, reducing the past daily coal consumption from 20 tons to 13 tons. The factory lacked iron plates, and the technical staff criticized the "insurance" thinking in the past design process through "product recall meetings," and rationally improved the shell and parts of the By-type fan, which can save 97 tons of steel throughout the year. The utilization rate of various plates has increased from 50% to 60% in the past, and the utilization rate of profiles has increased from 70% to 90% in the past. Many employees also put forward rationalization proposals from the aspects of improving product quality, high-altitude and high-temperature operation safety, eliminating waste of water and electricity, and product packaging. For example, employees proposed a series of methods such as simplifying packaging and recycling packaging wood, which can save 1,500 cubic meters of wood throughout the year.
    Facts have proved that the attitude of waiting for the final plan and waiting for raw materials is passive. Only by actively leading the masses of workers to tap potential can we overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials; only by mobilizing the masses of workers can the task of increasing production and practicing economy be better completed.

    不能消极等待
    文天申
    目前，辽宁有些工厂的领导人员还迟迟地不敢发动职工群众开展增产节约运动。有的领导人员认为：国家的计划还没有最后确定，原材料没有着落，如果把群众发动起来，原材料供不应求的情况岂不将更紧张了吗？有的领导人员估计到今年任务不足，虽然预先揽了些零活，可是耽心没有自备材料，不敢发动群众进行生产准备工作。个别工厂还形成了“正科长进京要料，副科长愁得只叫，采购员在家无事，保管员在仓库睡觉”的局面。
    其实，今年的国家计划虽然还没有最后确定，但国务院在去年12月已下达了今年的计划控制数字，各主管部和各地已根据这个数字安排了第一季度的生产。许多工矿企业正是根据这些安排并结合自身的情况，发动职工群众来开展增产节约运动的。沈阳扇风机厂就是其中的一个。
    沈阳扇风机厂的领导人员在1月份就发现生产中铁板缺一百五十多吨，木材缺70％，焦炭、滚轴、电机等也都缺乏。他们就把生产中的这些关键问题向职工群众作了交代，并发动科室、车间对1956年的经济活动进行了分析。结果仅在材料费一项中，群众就检查出三百多件浪费材料的现象。领导上及时把群众的意见归纳成二十一个生产技术课题，组织老工人、科室技术人员等成立专题小组进行研究，并动员群众讨论、补充修正。一些重大的生产、企业改造问题，厂长还向苏联专家或东北财经学院的教授请教。这样，工厂不仅安排了第一季度的生产，还制定了今年的生产技术组织措施计划，开展了增产节约运动。
    在讨论技术组织措施计划当中，工人们提出的四百八十四件合理化建议，被采纳了二百七十九件。工程技术人员在改进产品设计、工艺方面也提出了一百六十六项建议。这样，过去生产上的许多难题已大部分得到了圆满的解决。例如工厂缺燃料，工人们就提出用反射炉烧煤代替焦炭，还推广了烧煤先进经验，将过去每天用煤二十吨减少到十三吨。工厂缺铁板，技术人员就通过“产品回忆会”，批判了过去设计工艺中的“保险”思想，合理改进了By型扇风机的外壳和部件，全年就可节约钢材九十七吨。各种板材的利用率已由过去的50％提高到60％，型材的利用率已由过去的70％提高到90％。许多职工还从提高产品质量、高空高温操作安全、杜绝水电浪费，以及产品包装等方面提出了合理化建议。例如职工们提出简化包装、包装木材回收等一系列办法，仅木材一项全年就能节约一千五百立方公尺。
    事实证明，坐待确定计划和坐待原材料的态度是消极的。只有积极地领导职工群众去挖掘潜力，才有助于克服原材料不足的困难；只有发动职工群众，增产节约任务才能完成得更好。
