　　Promote Democratic Spirit, Change the Practice of Taking Everything Into One's Own Hands
    This newspaper reports that the Jian Guo Agricultural Cooperative in Sha County, Fujian Province, has changed the practice of the cooperative cadres taking everything into their own hands and implementing the principle of democratic management of the cooperative. It relied on the members to revise the annual production plan, which has achieved good results.
    The initial production plan of the Jian Guo Agricultural Cooperative was drawn up by the cadres alone. Several key cadres, based on subjective views, vaguely proposed a target of increasing the cooperative's grain production by 10% this year and evenly distributed the increased production tasks to each production team. This practice of taking everything into one's own hands aroused dissatisfaction among many members. The members said: This plan has targets, but no measures; it has grain, but lacks other things; it has the collective, but not the individual. At the same time, there were many opinions among the teams, believing that the assigned tasks were unreasonable.
    After checking and discovering this problem, the cooperative cadres realized that the practice of taking everything into one's own hands was wrong and immediately mobilized the members to revise the original production plan, starting from summarizing the experiences and lessons learned in last year's production. The members put forward many reasonable suggestions during the discussion. For example, last year the cooperative suffered from a drought that resulted in the failure of 158 mu of paddy fields. The members believed that as long as water conservancy projects are built this year, ordinary droughts can be basically eliminated, and it is expected that at least 60,000 jin of grain can be increased. Last year, there were 161 mu of double-cropping rice, but due to improper selection of fields, the yield of two crops was not as good as one crop. The members suggested planting according to local conditions this year, which could increase grain production by more than 10,000 jin. In addition, the members also suggested implementing measures such as early sowing, increasing fertilizer and careful cultivation, and rationally allocating labor. The members also put forward supplementary plans for the development of diversified economy. After the revised grain and diversified economic production plan is realized, the cooperative can increase grain production by 13% this year, and the total output value can increase by 24.8% compared with last year.
    After the cooperative's production plan was revised, the members formulated and revised the production plans of each team according to the cooperative's increased production requirements and the different production potential of each team, overcoming the shortcomings of the past of evenly distributing increased production tasks to each team. Under the premise of doing a good job in the collective production within the cooperative, the members' individual household sideline occupations were also arranged.

### 发扬民主精神，改变包办作风

　　发扬民主精神，改变包办作风
    本报讯　福建省沙县建国农业合作社改变社干部包办代替的作法，贯彻民主办社的原则，依靠社员修订了全年生产计划，收到了很好的效果。
    建国农业社最初的生产计划，是干部一手包办订出来的。几个主要干部根据主观的看法，笼统地提出了今年全社增产粮食一成的指标，并且把增产任务平均分配给各生产队。这种包办代替的作法，引起很多社员的不满。社员们说：这个计划有指标，没措施；有粮食，缺其他；有集体，没个人。同时队与队之间也意见纷纷，认为分配的任务不合理。
    在检查发现这个问题后，社干部们认识到包办代替的作法是不对的，立即大力发动社员从总结去年生产中的经验教训入手，修订原来的生产计划。社员在讨论中提出许多合理的建议。例如去年全社遭受旱灾而绝收的稻田达一百五十八亩，社员们认为今年只要兴修水利，就可以基本消灭普通旱灾，预计最少可增产六万多斤粮食。去年有一百六十一亩双季稻，因田地选择不当，两季收成不如一季，社员们建议今年因地种植，可增产一万多斤粮食。此外，社员们还建议推行提早播种、增肥细作和合理搭配劳动力等措施。对于多种经济的发展，社员们也提出了补充计划。实现了修订后的粮食和多种经济生产计划，全社今年可以增产粮食一成三，总产值可比去年增加24.8％。
    全社生产计划修订好了以后，社员们又根据全社增产要求和各队不同的生产潜力，制定和修订了各队的生产计划，克服了过去向各队平均分配增产任务的缺点。在搞好社内集体生产的前提下，社员个人的家庭副业也作了安排。
