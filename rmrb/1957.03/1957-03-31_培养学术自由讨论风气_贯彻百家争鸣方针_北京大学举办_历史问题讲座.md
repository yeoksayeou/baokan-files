Cultivate a climate of free academic discussion; Implement the "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy.
Peking University holds "Lectures on Historical Issues"

(Our Dispatch) In order to foster an atmosphere of free academic discussion and implement the policy of "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," the Department of History at Peking University has organized "Lectures on Historical Issues" starting this year. This lecture series will welcome Chinese and foreign scholars with different views and perspectives on historical issues—including idealists—including scholars from capitalist countries to give lectures. This lecture series is not limited to faculty and students of the university, but also welcomes students from other schools and people from outside the university. Professor Jian Bozan, Director of the Department of History at Peking University, said: Opening academic lectures to the public is one of the fine traditions of Peking University, as well as a fine tradition of the ancient Chinese academy system, and we should inherit this fine tradition today.

The first lecture in the series of lectures on historical issues was held on the afternoon of March 25, with Comrade Fan Wenlan reporting on "Several Issues in Historical Research." More than 3,000 people attended the lecture, including professors, students, workers, government cadres, soldiers, and members of other academic organizations, as well as foreign guests such as the famous Egyptian archaeologist Professor Emile and Miss Ann Booke, the daughter of the Swedish Ambassador to China. This report mainly pointed out the correct methods of studying history and conducting historical research for general historians, and, based on the spirit of "contention," put forward critical opinions on the "Outline of Chinese History" edited by Comrade Shang Yue. The report touched on issues such as strengthening theoretical study, opposing dogmatism, mastering materials, and attaching importance to material work.

The second lecture was held on the afternoon of March 30, with Professor Duman, Deputy Director of the Institute of China of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, reporting on "On the Nature of Western Han Society." Professor Duman has long been engaged in the study of ancient Chinese history, and the ancient Chinese history part of the recently published ten-volume "World History" in the Soviet Union was written by him.

Was the Western Han Dynasty a feudal society or a slave society? Soviet scholars have not yet reached a consensus on this issue. In his report, Professor Duman affirmed that it was an early feudal society, arguing that the dominant social system at that time was an early form of feudalism, and the slave system was only preserved as an economic structure. He focused on analyzing the forms of land ownership, the conditions of direct producers, and the forms of exploitation in the Western Han Dynasty, proving that the main direct producers at that time were farmers rather than slaves.

In order to refute scholars who argued that the Western Han Dynasty was a slave society, Professor Duman also analyzed the position and role of slaves in Western Han society. He said that we do not deny the existence of a large number of slaves in Western Han society, but we cannot think that they played a major role in production. Moreover, the legal status of slaves also underwent great changes in the Han Dynasty, and it was impossible to kill slaves arbitrarily at that time.

In addition to most of the audience who attended the first lecture, those who attended the second lecture included Professor Long Peter of Cambridge University in the United Kingdom and Ma Yueran of the Swedish Embassy.

This lecture series will continue to be held in the future. In addition to already inviting Hou Wailu, Deng Tuo, Hu Sheng, Shang Yue, Zheng Zhenduo, and the 78-year-old historian Chen Yuan, the Department of History at Peking University also plans to invite historians such as Lu Zhenyu, Wu Han, and Gu Jiegang to give lectures. Egyptian archaeologist Professor Emile is also willing to give a report on this forum. According to the demands of the masses, the Department of History at Peking University will also invite Dean Guo Moruo to give a lecture. (Yi, Da)

### 培养学术自由讨论风气　贯彻百家争鸣方针  北京大学举办“历史问题讲座”

    培养学术自由讨论风气　贯彻百家争鸣方针
    北京大学举办“历史问题讲座”
    本报讯　为了培养学术问题自由讨论的风气，贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针，北京大学历史系自今年起主办“历史问题讲座”。这个讲座将欢迎对历史问题具有不同见解、不同观点——包括唯心论在内——的中、外学者，包括资本主义国家的学者前来讲学。这个讲座不限于本校师生听讲，而且欢迎校外的学生和校外人士听讲。北京大学历史系主任翦伯赞教授说：学术讲演向社会开门，是北京大学的优良传统之一，也是中国古代书院制度的优良传统之一，今天我们应该把这种优良传统继承下来。
    历史问题讲座第一讲已在3月25日下午举行，由范文澜同志报告
  “关于历史研究中的若干问题”。参加这次讲座听讲的共三千多人，其中有教授、学生、工人、机关干部、军人和其他学术团体的人员，还有埃及著名考古学家埃米尔教授、瑞典驻我国大使的女儿安·布克小姐等外宾。这篇报告主要是为一般史学工作者指出学习历史和研究历史的正确方法，并且根据“争鸣”精神，对尚钺同志主编的“中国历史纲要”提出批评的意见。报告中谈到了加强理论学习、反对教条主义、掌握资料和重视资料工作等问题。
    第二讲于3月30日下午举行，由苏联科学院中国研究所副所长杜曼教授报告“论西汉社会性质问题”。杜曼教授很早就从事中国古代史的研究工作，最近陆续出版的苏联十卷本世界通史中的中国史古代部分就是由他执笔的。
    西汉到底是封建社会还是奴隶社会呢？苏联学者到目前为止还没有一致的意见。杜曼教授在报告中肯定它是早期封建社会，认为当时占主导地位的社会制度是早期形式的封建制度，奴隶制度只是作为一种经济结构被保存下来。他着重地分析了西汉的土地占有形态、直接生产者状况和剥削形式，证明了当时主要直接生产者是农民而不是奴隶。
    为了反驳主张西汉是奴隶社会的学者，杜曼教授又分析了奴隶在西汉社会中所占的地位和作用。他说，我们并不否认西汉社会中大量奴婢的存在，但不能认为他们在生产中起主要作用。并且，奴隶的法权地位在汉代也起了很大的变化，当时是不能任意杀害奴婢的。
    参加听第二讲的，除曾听第一讲的大部分听众外，还有英国剑桥大学教授龙彼得和瑞典大使馆的马悦然等外宾。
    这个讲座，今后将继续举行。北京大学历史系除已经约请了侯外庐、邓拓、胡绳、尚钺、郑振铎和七十八岁的老史学家陈垣先生等外，并且准备约请吕振羽、吴晗和顾颉刚等史学家来讲演。埃及考古学家埃米尔教授也愿意在这个讲坛上作一次报告。根据群众的要求，北京大学历史系还将约请郭沫若院长来讲演。　（义、达）
