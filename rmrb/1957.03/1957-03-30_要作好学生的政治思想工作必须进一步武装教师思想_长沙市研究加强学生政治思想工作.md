　　To do a good job in students' political and ideological work, it is necessary to further arm teachers' minds. This is the common view of the heads of the Changsha City Education Bureau, the Cultural and Educational Department of the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Municipal Education Union when they recently met to study strengthening students' political and ideological work. This meeting was held on March 20th.
　　The meeting analyzed the political and ideological education work in Changsha City in the previous stage. It was believed that the entire work was being carried out in a planned and orderly manner. Many school principals and Party branch secretaries personally took charge of students' political and ideological education work, teachers taught their lessons more conscientiously, students had a higher enthusiasm for learning, learning discipline was better than in the previous semester, and the overly tense emotions of graduating students tended to ease. All of this showed that political and ideological education had achieved good results. However, the work of arming teachers' minds was not sufficiently grasped. Many teachers, especially homeroom teachers, had not been fully mobilized. Many teachers and homeroom teachers not only lacked working methods, but also did not sufficiently recognize the important significance of ideological education work. When talking to students and giving reports, the reasoning was not deep or thorough enough, and there were even instances of saying wrong things.
　　The meeting believed that to arm teachers' minds, it is first necessary to understand the teachers' ideological situation. The meeting decided to invite relevant responsible comrades to give reports to teachers and organize them to study documents, or to hold discussion meetings with schools as units, combining with the specific conditions of the school for discussion. The Municipal Education Bureau also plans to hold a representative teachers' symposium to exchange experiences in political and ideological work.
　　The meeting also discussed the methods of conducting political and ideological education for students. Arrangements were also made for the next stage of political and ideological work.

　  要作好学生的政治思想工作必须进一步武装教师思想
　　长沙市研究加强学生政治思想工作
    本报讯  加强对学生的政治思想教育，必须进一步武装教师的思想。这是长沙市教育局、中共长沙市委文教部、团市委、市教育工会等单位负责人最近开会研究加强学生政治思想工作时共同的看法。这个会是3月20日开的。
    会议对长沙市前一阶段的政治思想教育工作进行了分析。认为整个工作是在有计划有秩序地进行。许多学校校长、党支部书记都亲自动手抓学生的政治思想教育工作，教师教课比较认真，学生学习积极性高，学习纪律比上学期好，毕业班学生过分紧张的情绪趋向缓和，这都说明政治思想教育已收到了很好的效果。但是，对武装教师思想的工作抓得不够，许多教师特别是班主任还没有充分发动起来，不少教师和班主任不仅缺少工作办法，而且对思想教育工作的重要意义也认识不足，对学生谈话、做报告，道理讲得不深不透，甚至还有讲错的地方。
    会议认为：要武装教师的思想，首先要摸清教师的思想情况。会议决定邀请有关负责同志给教师做报告并组织他们学习文件，或以学校为单位开座谈会，结合本校的具体情况进行讨论。市教育局还准备开一个有代表性的教师座谈会，交流政治思想工作经验。
    会议还讨论了对学生进行政治思想教育的方式方法问题。对下一段的政治思想工作也作了安排。
