    捷沃西安通知岸信介
    苏联愿遣返日侨及其家属
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社东京16日讯：苏联驻日本大使捷沃西安在16日拜会了日本首相兼外务相岸信介，并且通知他说，苏联有关当局应日本方面的请求和根据1956年10月19日苏日联合宣言，查明了在苏联境内居住有七百九十三名无国籍日本人和他们的家属一百四十六名朝鲜人。苏联有关当局已经通知这些人，如果他们愿意，他们可以返回日本。
    捷沃西安说，已经有二百二十五名日本人和他们的一百四十六名家属朝鲜人表示希望返回日本。如果日本当局同意接收这些人，他们就可以在双方协议的期间内被遣回日本。
    捷沃西安还指出，根据经过查对的材料，日本方面提出的在苏联境内居住的日本人的人数与实际情况不符。日本方面提出的名单中有一百三十九人早已经被遣回日本。
    岸信介对捷沃西安大使的通知表示感谢，并且表示相信，日本人民将怀着深深感激的心情来对待这项通知。
