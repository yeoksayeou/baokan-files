　　I originally didn't plan to speak at this meeting because Mr. Wu Yaozong, a member of our Christian community, already spoke on our behalf, and I fully endorse his opinions and suggestions. However, after his speech, I noticed that it attracted a great deal of special attention and interest from many members, but some misunderstood his motivation and opinions. They overlooked the three major premises that Mr. Wu affirmed at the outset: First, "The government has made great efforts and achieved significant accomplishments in implementing religious policies." He also said: "For the sake of this historical transformation of Chinese Christianity (referring to the Three-Self Patriotic Movement), we have to express our heartfelt gratitude to the People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party." Third, Mr. Wu also said: "We Chinese Christians will not be deceived by imperialist propaganda. We love the bright and splendid New China, we love the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao who lead New China. We will manage our churches well, we will contribute our greatest strength to the socialist construction of our motherland, and we will also unite closely with Christians around the world who love justice and peace to strive for the noble goals of world peace and human progress." Mr. Wu expressed his opinions under the above three major premises. No one opposed Mr. Wu's opinions, which stated: "Some churches are not allowed to resume worship services. In small cities and rural areas, church buildings and furniture are occupied by government agencies and organizations. Believers' religious lives are sometimes interfered with, and religious believers are also discriminated against. Some cadres have formulated a series of 'prohibitions' for churches, such as: prohibiting donations, prohibiting the construction of churches, prohibiting the development of believers, etc." "Some cadres not only do not respect the religious sentiments of believers, but also adopt rude or insulting attitudes." Everyone agreed that these were deviations and errors on the part of the cadres and should be corrected. However, some friends believe that Mr. Wu should not "raise some intangible issues related to the implementation of religious policies," thinking that Mr. Wu is opposed to or afraid of others criticizing his religious beliefs. On the contrary, Mr. Wu said: "Those who believe in religion have freedom, and those who do not believe in religion and criticize religion also have freedom. We do not feel uncomfortable just because someone criticizes religion. A religious believer who humbly seeks truth is not afraid of others criticizing his religious beliefs."

　　Please allow me to add a few words to support the opinions and suggestions expressed by Mr. Wu. First, I want to make it clear that the contradiction between believing in religion and not believing in religion, between atheism and theism, is an ideological contradiction among the people, not an antagonistic contradiction. Everyone is Chinese people, not enemies and friends. It is a contradiction that requires distinguishing right from wrong, pursuing truth, and allowing a hundred schools of thought to contend. Therefore, those who believe in religion have the freedom to spread religion, and those who do not believe in religion have the freedom to criticize religion. When the two "families" are "contending" in this way, it is to clarify right and wrong, discover truth, and be calm and peaceful. Rude and insulting attitudes must never be adopted. You state your atheistic theories, and I state my theistic principles. When you and I are debating right and wrong in this way, you cannot curse my mother, let alone dig up my ancestral grave and insult my ancestors. In the eyes of us who believe in God, God is the supreme and ultimate existence. The church is God's temple, the sacred dwelling place where believers worship God. When we debate the existence or non-existence of God, if you insult God and blaspheme God's name, if you forcibly occupy the church, as a Christian from a minority ethnic group wrote to me the day before yesterday: "The church is still being used by them, it is filthy and unbearable to look at, and has become a place for livestock." Such desecration of the church is a greater stimulus to us than digging up our ancestral graves. Another example is a high-ranking cadre who, when speaking at the opening ceremony of an iron bridge, emphasized that the iron bridge was created by human power, not by the work of any God. He said, "You who believe in God should throw your God into the latrine." Such blasphemy of God is more unbearable to those who believe in God than cursing their mother. This is not criticizing religion, we believe this is slandering religion. When Chairman Mao spoke to the Tibetan tribute delegation on November 22, 1952, he said: "The Communist Party adopts a policy of protecting religion. Those who believe in religion and those who do not believe in religion, those who believe in this religion or those who believe in other religions, are all protected, and their beliefs are respected." We religious believers greatly admire and are grateful for this declaration by Chairman Mao. What particularly moves and comforts us is that he said, not only protecting religious beliefs, but also "respecting their beliefs," paying special attention to the word "respect." Respect means not blaspheming the God we believe in and not defiling the church where we worship God.

　　On the other hand, I want to say that even if someone insults us for our faith and defiles our temple, we can endure it and can forgive them, because we remember that our Christian church was once used by imperialism as a tool to invade China. We also remember how, especially in the Middle Ages, religion opposed science and persecuted scientists. When astronomers said that the earth was round, we thought it was not in accordance with the Bible, so we cut off their tongues, forbade them to speak, imprisoned them, and some were burned to death. Now that science is in power, it has not retaliated against us in that way. If we encounter a little insult and difficulty, can we not endure it? We must know that those who are now insulting us and fabricating all kinds of bad things to slander us are none other than imperialist missionaries, so we should be happy and rejoice, because Jesus said, "Your reward in heaven is great."

　　Here I also want to say that if there are any deviations and errors in the implementation of religious policies, we can endure it, we can forgive it, and we are not surprised, because it is a new undertaking and a new task for the Christian church to sever relations with imperialism and build a church that is self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating. None of us have ever done it before, and we have no advanced experience to learn from. We can only grope slowly and do our best to do it, and deviations and errors are of course inevitable. Not to mention that the working comrades are non-believers in religion and may make deviations and errors, even we Christian workers ourselves have made countless mistakes in promoting the Three-Self Patriotic Movement in the past few years. I, an old man, have made the most mistakes. Furthermore, as members of the CPPCC, we have the opportunity to inspect the social conditions in various places, and we have found that deviations and errors are inevitable in the implementation of various policies such as education policies, industrial policies, commercial policies, health policies, etc. Relatively speaking, the deviations and errors in the implementation of religious policies are very, very few. If there are some deviations and errors in the implementation of industrial policies, one cannot and should not conclude that workers have no freedom to work. Similarly, one cannot and should not conclude that religious believers have no freedom of religious belief just because cadres have a little deviation and error in implementing religious policies. In 1948, when I was in the United States, an American pastor told me, "We pastors in the United States do not dare to speak the word 'peace' on the pulpit, otherwise we will be suspected of being communists and will lose our jobs." Even so, I can only say that it is a deviation and error in the implementation of religious policies in the United States. One cannot and should not conclude that there is no freedom of religious belief in the United States. I say again, it is not surprising that there are deviations, because China is so big and there are so many people. It would be strange if there were no deviations and errors in building a poor and backward agricultural country into a prosperous and happy socialist society, which none of us has ever done before. We are offering our opinions only to correct errors and deviations. At the same time, we express our heartfelt gratitude and respect to the working comrades for their help and care and for correctly implementing the policy of religious freedom.

　　The article "On the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship" stated: "Learning from the Soviet Union must have a correct method. All the experiences of the Soviet Union, including the basic experiences, are combined with certain national characteristics and should not be copied as they are by other countries... There are also erroneous and failed parts in the Soviet Union's experience. All these successful and failed experiences are invaluable to those who are good at learning. Because they can help us avoid detours and reduce losses. On the contrary, if we copy them as they are without analysis, then the experiences that were successful in the Soviet Union can also cause failures in other countries, not to mention the failed experiences." The October Socialist Revolution in Russia was successful and established the Soviet Republic. The Russian Orthodox Church was a large landlord, and the priests of the church had always colluded with the Tsarist court to oppress and exploit the people. After the success of the October Revolution, the Russian Orthodox Church notified all churches in the country not to recognize the new government and to oppose the Communist Party. Therefore, Stalin ordered the persecution of the Orthodox Church and confiscated churches. More than 20 years later, during World War II, Soviet Orthodox believers and bishops became politically aware. In the war of defending the country, religious believers expressed their love for the motherland and fought heroically. Stalin saw this and immediately ordered that churches and other properties be returned to the church, allowing them to resume worship services, and stopped all activities against religion. The Chinese Communist Party did not copy this advanced experience of the Soviet Union as it was, because it did not apply to the characteristics of the Chinese nation. One of the three magic weapons of the Chinese Communist Party in the Chinese revolution is the united front. This is the creative Marxism of the Chinese Communist Party, which the Soviet Union did not have, because it was created by combining the characteristics of the Chinese nation. Our Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is the organization of the united front, and all religious organizations are invited as a link in the united front. We Christians feel honored and have also learned a lesson. In order to unite Christians across the country, we initiated and launched a "Chinese Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement," calling on Christians across the country to love the motherland, oppose imperialism, and strive for world peace. This movement has also achieved certain results. Now the vast majority of Christians across the country have formally signed up to participate in this movement. As a result, some patriotic activists have also emerged in the Christian church. Most of the Christians live in Shanghai, and the government's implementation of religious policies is also the most correct in Shanghai. According to incomplete statistics, among the members of the 106 churches in Shanghai, more than 998 people have been commended and rewarded as model workers, advanced workers, outstanding teachers, three-good students, literacy activists, five-good activists, and sanitation models.

　　Mr. Wu Yaozong raised "intangible issues" related to the implementation of religious policies and pointed out that many pamphlets criticizing religion have been published. Mr. Wu said that he has read more than 20 books. I have only read more than a dozen books. Yesterday, I received a letter from a preacher who said that he has "read more than 40 books criticizing faith in the past few years." Perhaps I can add that after reading these more than 40 books criticizing faith, this Christian said: "Thanks to God's grace and protection, I am convinced of who I believe in, and my faith has become more firm." But what I want to say is that these books and pamphlets criticizing faith are almost all translated from Russian. There are also a few books whose content is actually the information from theological professors in our own Christian seminaries criticizing Christianity. Perhaps everyone knows that Christians are divided into two factions: modernists and conservatives. Modernists also want to use scientific methods to criticize the Bible. When Marx grew up in Germany, the Christianity he believed in was modernist. Later, he gave up his faith. We respect him for believing in God. We also respect him for not believing in God. Because we know that whether he believes first and then does not believe, it is all out of sincerity. Marx was very familiar with the Bible, and he quoted the Bible more than 40 times in his "Capital." He also criticized the Bible, and even we conservative Christians are happy to accept his criticism. He was not against Christianity itself, but against Christians not practicing according to the Bible.

　　Reading Chinese history, we can know that there have been many people in China who have believed in various religions throughout the ages, but there has never been any religious war. This is a characteristic of our Chinese nation.

　　Recently, reading "Lectures on the History of Modern Chinese Revolution," it says: "During the period of the old democratic revolution, the Chinese people had carried out many revolutionary struggles, among which the largest in scale and the most far-reaching in influence were the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom peasant war and the revolution of 1911 led by Sun Yat-sen, a representative of the bourgeois petty bourgeoisie. These revolutionary struggles played a huge role in combating feudalism and imperialism." (Page 6 of the book) Like me, an old man who has been preaching Christianity for more than 50 years, reading the history written by a Communist Party member, saying these two facts, on the one hand, makes me feel ashamed, because I know that for more than 100 years, imperialism has used Christian missionaries as the vanguard of invading China, and even many of our Chinese Christians have intentionally or unintentionally become their accomplices. Therefore, we feel extremely sad because we have let down our motherland and the people. On the other hand, we feel happy and glad, because Hong Xiuquan, the leader of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution, and Sun Yat-sen, the representative of the bourgeois revolutionary democrats, both of whom were Christian, had both been baptized as Christian and had both received inspiration from the teachings of Christ Jesus. Their spirit of service, spirit of sacrifice, and spirit of revolution were learned from the Lord Jesus, because Jesus' teachings say: "The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." Jesus also said: "The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free." Jesus' mother Mary prayed that her son would "perform mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts. He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble. He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty." George Bernard Shaw said: "This song (originally in the form of a poem) is the most revolutionary song and the most revolutionary text in European history."

　　I have visited the cemetery of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang. I have examined the inscriptions and found that many martyrs (some say more than half) were disciples of Christ Jesus, which is not accidental. Recently, in the January issue of the "History Teaching" monthly magazine this year, Professor Lei Haizong of Tsinghua University, using a completely historical and scientific perspective, discussed the sects of Christianity. He said: "Primitive Christianity was originally a movement of the working people in the cities within the Roman Empire in the first century AD, including independent handicraftsmen, slaves, poor citizens without fixed occupations, and other people whose status was unstable and whose lives were insecure, to resist the rule of the empire. It was a people's movement in history that often resisted the ruling class in a religious way." Engels also made the same comment on Christianity as Mr. Lei, saying that Christianity was originally a revolutionary movement to liberate slaves in a slave society.

　　After the national liberation, we Christians across the country responded to the call of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement and strengthened our studies, studying current affairs, studying politics, and many people also studying Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, we also re-studied our Bible, especially studying the Three-Self: self-government, self-support, and self-propagation. Self-propagation in the Three-Self means discovering the ideological toxins of imperialism, feudalism, and capitalism in the Christianity we have always preached. We ourselves have criticized and are criticizing our Christian faith, negatively eliminating anti-communist and anti-Soviet ideological toxins, and actively establishing Christian truths and the essence of Christianity that conform to the Bible. We re-emphasize that Jesus was a carpenter, that the Son of God became incarnate and lived in the world for more than 33 years, and spent more than 20 years engaged in labor, working as a craftsman and farmer, thereby raising the status of labor. We, as believers of Jesus, should also learn from Jesus to love labor and love labor production. Re-learning the teachings of the Bible: "For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: 'The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.'" Re-practicing the teachings of the Bible: "Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer (exploiting people is stealing), but must work, doing something useful with their own hands, that they may have something to share with those in need." This is certainly not to say that we will no longer preach the salvation of Jesus on the cross. We still preach the doctrine of redemption by the precious blood. We are learning self-propagation just to enrich the content of our faith. We also study political economics and know that there are two economic principles: first, "Material production is the foundation of society. People must have food, clothing, and other material things to live. If people are to have these things, they must produce them, they must labor." The second principle: "People do not produce material things alone, but collectively as a society. Therefore, there must be relations of production between people, and the relations of production must conform to the laws of the nature of production." Using this economic perspective to study Christian doctrines, we find that these principles are also the principles spoken by the Old Testament prophets, the New Testament apostles, and the Lord Jesus. We Christians should act accordingly. Therefore, we are very happy to note that the resurrected Jesus, one morning, stood by the Sea of Galilee and asked the seven disciples who were fishing on the lake, when they were hungry and cold: "Children, do you have anything to eat?" When they came ashore, they saw that the Lord had prepared charcoal fire for them, with fish and bread on it. Jesus said: "Come and have breakfast." From this, it can be seen that the Lord Jesus came into the world not only to shed precious blood to save our souls, but also to labor and produce to provide for the needs of our bodies. Therefore, we Christians can also say the same as Buddhist member Zhao Puchu: "We should not only according to our obligations (the obligations of citizens), but also according to our faith (Christians are also learning from the example of the Lord Jesus), love our country, abide by the constitution of the country, and further unite with the people of the whole country, actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland and the movement to defend world peace."

　　The above immature opinions were written in a hurry, and there must be many errors. Please correct me. (Attached picture)

　　保护宗教信仰　尊重宗教信仰
　　陈崇桂的发言
    此次会议我本来不想说话，因为我们基督教有吴耀宗委员代表我们发言，我完全拥护他的意见和建议。但是他讲话之后，我发见他的发言引起了许许多多委员的特别注意和兴趣，其中却有人误会了他发言的动机和意见。他们忽略了吴先生首先肯定了的三个大前提：第一：“政府对贯彻宗教政策作了很大的努力，也有了很大的成就。”他又说：“为了中国基督教这个历史的转变（指三自爱国运动），我们不得不对人民政府，和中国共产党，表示衷心的感谢。”第三吴先生又说：“我们中国基督徒不会受帝国主义宣传的迷惑，我们热爱灿烂光明的新中国，我们热爱领导新中国的中国共产党和毛主席，我们要把我们的教会管理得很好，我们要为祖国的社会主义建设贡献我们最大的力量，我们也要与全世界爱好正义，爱好和平的基督徒紧密地团结起来，为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力。”吴先生乃是在以上三个大前提之下发表一点意见的。没有人反对吴先生所提出来的意见说：“有的教会不许恢复礼拜，在小城市和乡村教会中，房屋和家具被机关团体占用，信徒的宗教生活有时亦受到干涉，对宗教信徒也有歧视，有些干部给教会制定一系列的‘禁令’，例如：不准奉献，不准修建礼拜堂，不准发展信徒等，”“有些干部对信徒的宗教情感不但不尊重，反而采取粗暴或侮辱的态度，”大家都认为这是干部的偏差错误，应当纠正。但是有些朋友，认为吴先生不该“提出一些与贯彻宗教政策有关的无形的问题，”以为吴先生是反对，是惧怕别人批判他的宗教信仰。恰恰相反，吴先生说过：“信仰宗教的有自由，不信宗教的，批判宗教的也有自由。我们也不是因为有人批判宗教，便感到不舒服。一个虚心追求真理的宗教信仰者，是不怕别人批判他的宗教信仰的。”
    请允许我补充几句话，支持吴先生发表的意见和建议。首先我要说明，信宗教不信宗教，无神论与有神论的矛盾，是人民内部的思想矛盾，不是对抗性的矛盾，大家都是中国人民，不是敌人与朋友的矛盾，乃是要分清是非，追求真理，百家争鸣的矛盾。所以信宗教的有传布宗教的自由，不信宗教的有批判宗教的自由，在我们两“家”这样“争鸣”的时候，是辨明是非，发现真理，要平心静气，决不可采取粗暴和侮辱的态度。你说你无神论的理论，我说我有神论的道理，在你我这样辩论是非的时候，你不可骂我的母亲，更不可挖我的祖坟，侮辱我的祖宗。在我们信神的人看，神是至高至上至尊的最高的存在。礼拜堂是神的圣殿，是信徒敬拜神的神圣居所。在我们辩论有神无神的时候，你若侮辱神，亵渎神的名，你若强占礼拜堂，如同前天收到一位少数民族的基督徒写信给我说：“礼拜堂仍被他们用着，污七八糟，目不忍睹，成为牲畜所在的地方。”这样玷污礼拜堂，比挖我们的祖坟，给我们的刺激更大。又如一位高级干部，在一座铁桥行落成礼的时候讲话，强调这座铁桥是人力创造的，不是甚么上帝的工作，他说：“你们信上帝的人，要把你们的上帝丢在粪坑里，”像这样亵渎神，在信神的人看来，比骂他的母亲还难受。这不是批判宗教，我们认为这是毁谤宗教。毛主席在1952年11月22日对西藏致敬团讲话时说：“共产党对宗教采取保护政策，信教的和不信教的，信这种教的或信别种教的，一律加以保护，尊重其信仰。”我们宗教徒非常钦佩感激毛主席这个宣言，特别感动我们，安慰我们的是他说，不但保护宗教信仰，并且“尊重其信仰”，特别注意“尊重”二字，尊重就是不亵渎我们所信靠的神，不玷污我们敬神的礼拜堂。
    又一方面，我要说，就是有人为信仰辱骂我们，玷污我们的圣殿，我们也能忍受，并且可以原谅，因为我们记得，我们基督教会曾被帝国主义利用，作为侵略中国的工具。我们又记得，特别在中世纪的时候，宗教如何反对科学，迫害科学家，天文家讲地球是圆的，我们认为不合圣经，就割他的舌头，不许他讲，监禁他们，有的用火烧死他们。如今科学掌了政权，却没有那样报复我们，遇见一点小小的侮辱和困难，难道不能忍受么？我们要知道现在辱骂我们，捏造各样坏话毁谤我们的不是别人，乃是帝国主义的传教士，所以应当欢喜快乐，因为耶稣说“你们在天上的赏赐是大的。”
    在这里我还要说，执行宗教政策，发生一点偏差错误，我们能忍受，也能原谅，也不见怪，因为基督教会割断帝国主义的关系，建设自治自养自传的教会，这是一件新事业，新工作，我们谁也没有作过的，我们也没有甚么先进的经验可学，只有慢慢地摸索，尽心竭力地去做，当然免不了偏差错误。莫说工作同志是不信宗教的人，会出偏差错误，就是我们基督教工人自己在这几年推行三自爱国运动的时候，也不知犯了多少错误，我这老朽犯的错误最多。再者，我们政协委员有机会视察地方的社会情况，我们发见了在执行各种政策如教育政策、工业政策、商业政策、卫生政策等等都难免有偏差错误。比较起来，执行宗教政策的偏差错误还是很少很少的。执行工业政策有点偏差错误，不能，不可因此作结论说工人没有劳动的自由，照样，不能，不可，因为干部贯彻宗教政策有点小小偏差，错误，就作结论说宗教徒没有宗教信仰的自由。1948年我在美国，美国牧师告诉我，“我们在美国牧师在讲台上，不敢讲和平二字，否则就有共产党的嫌疑，就要打碎饭碗。就是那样，我也只能说是美国执行宗教政策的偏差错误，不能，不可作结论说美国没有宗教信仰自由。”我再说，有偏差这一点不稀奇，因为中国这么大，人民这么多，要把一个贫穷落后的农业国建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会，我们谁也没有作过这样的大事新事，要没有偏差错误才是奇怪的。我们提出意见来，不过是想改正错误和偏差。同时，我们对于工作同志给我们的帮助和爱护，正确地贯彻了宗教信仰政策，表示衷心地感激和敬意。
    “再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”文章中曾说：“学习苏联必须有正确的方法。苏联的一切经验，包括基本的经验，都是同一定的民族特点结合在一起的，都是别的国家所不应该原样照抄的。……苏联的经验中还有错误的失败的部分。所有这些成功的和失败的经验，对于善于学习的人都是无价之宝。因为它们都可以帮助我们少走弯路，少受损失。反之，如果不加分析地原样照抄，那么，在苏联成功了的经验也可以在别的国家造成失败，更不要说失败的经验了。”俄国十月社会主义革命成功，建立了苏联共和国。俄国的东正教会是大地主，教会的神甫向来是与沙皇朝廷狼狈为奸，压迫和剥削人民的。十月革命成功之后，俄国东正教主教通知全国各教会不承认新政府，反对共产党，所以斯大林才下令逼迫东正教会，没收礼拜堂。二十多年之后，第二次世界大战，苏联的东正教徒和主教，政治觉悟了，在卫国的战争中，宗教徒表示热爱祖国，英勇抗战，斯大林看见了，即刻下令，将礼拜堂和其它房产都退还教会，让他们恢复礼拜，也停止了一切反对宗教的活动。苏联的这个先进经验，中国共产党没有原样照抄，因为不适用于中国民族的特点。中国共产党在中国革命中的三个法宝之一，就是统一战线。这是中国共产党创造性地马克思主义，是苏联所没有的，因为是结合中国民族的特点而创造出来的。我们政治协商委员会就是统一战线的组织，将各宗教团体都邀请作为统一战线的一环节，我们基督教徒感觉荣幸，也学了功课，为要团结全国的基督徒，我们发起了并展开了一个“中国基督教三自爱国运动”，号召全国基督徒要爱祖国，要反对帝国主义，要争取世界和平。这个运动也得到一定的成绩，现在全国绝大多数的基督徒，都正式签名参加了这个运动，因此在基督教会内也出现一些爱国的积极分子。基督徒最多的是住在上海，政府贯彻宗教政策比较最正确的也是在上海，据不完全的统计，在上海一百零六个教堂的教友中，被评为劳动模范，先进工作者，优秀教师，三好学生，扫盲积极分子，五好积极分子和卫生模范等而受到表扬和奖励的就有九百九十八位以上。
    吴耀宗先生提出与贯彻宗教政策有关的“无形的问题”指出出版了不少的批判宗教的小册子，吴先生说他看了二十几本，我只看了十几本，昨天收到一个传道人的信，说他“几年来读了四十多本批判信仰的书”，或者我可以附带地说，这个基督徒读了这四十多本批判信仰的书以后，他说：“靠神的恩典保佑，使我确信所信的是谁，信仰更加坚定下来”，但是我所要说的是这些批判信仰的书和小册子，几乎都是从俄文翻译过来的，也有几本内容倒是我们基督教自己神学院里神学教授批判基督教的资料。也许大家知道基督教徒分两派：现代派、保守派，现代派也是想用科学的方法来批判圣经。马克思生长在德国的时候，他所信仰的基督教是现代派，后来他放弃了信仰。他信神，我们尊敬他。他不信神，我们也尊敬他的不信。因为我们知道他先信后不信，皆是出于诚实。马克思非常熟习圣经，在他写的“资本论”引用了圣经四十多次，他也曾批判圣经，连我们保守派的基督徒，也欢喜接受他的批评。他不是反对基督教本身，乃是反对基督教徒不照着圣经实行。
    读中国历史，可以知道中国历代有许多人信各样的宗教，但是从来没有甚么宗教战争。这是我中华民族一个特点。
    近来读“中国现代革命史讲义”，这么说：“旧民主主义革命时期，中国人民曾经进行过多次的革命斗争，其中规模最大影响最广的是太平天国的农民战争和以孙中山为代表的资产阶级小资产阶级所领导的1911年的革命，这些革命斗争在打击封建主义和帝国主义上都起了巨大的作用。”（该书第6页）像我这个传基督教五十多年的老人，读到了一位共产党员写的历史，说出了这两个事实：一面叫我感觉惭愧，因为我知道一百多年来帝国主义是利用了基督教的传教士，作侵略中国的先锋，甚至连我们许多中国基督徒，都有意地或无意地作了他们的帮凶，因此，我们感觉万分的伤心，因为对不起祖国和人民。又一面我们感觉快乐高兴，因为太平天国革命的领袖洪秀全，和资产阶级革命民主派的代表孙中山，这两位革命的伟人，都是基督徒，都受过基督教的洗礼，都从基督耶稣的教训得了启示。他们服务的精神，牺牲的精神，革命的精神是从主耶稣学习来的，因为耶稣的教训说：“人子来，不是要受人的服事，乃是要服事人，并且要舍命，作多人的赎价。”耶稣又说：“主的灵在我身上，因为他用膏膏我，叫我传福音给贫穷的人，差遣我报告被掳的得释放，瞎眼的得看见，叫那受压制的得自由。”耶稣的母亲马利亚祷告说她的儿子要“用臂膀施展大能，他叫有权柄的失位，叫卑贱的升高，叫饥饿的得饱美食，叫富足的空手回去。”萧伯纳说：“此歌（原文是诗歌式）为最革命的歌，是欧洲历史上最富革命性的文字。”
    我曾拜谒黄花岗七十二烈士的公墓，我查考碑文，发见许多烈士（有人说一大半）是基督耶稣的门徒，这不是偶然的。最近在“历史教学”月刊今年1月号，清华大学历史教授雷海宗先生，完全用历史科学的眼光，讲论基督教的宗派，他说：“原始的基督教本是公元一世纪罗马帝国内部城市中劳动人民，包括独立手工业者、奴隶、无固定职业的贫苦市民，以及其它地位不稳定、生活无保障的人民的一个反抗帝国统治的运动，是历史上时常出现的以宗教方式反抗统治阶级的一个人民运动。”恩格斯评论基督教也说过与雷先生相同的话，他说基督教原来是一个奴隶制社会的解放奴隶的革命运动。
      全国解放以后，我们全国基督徒响应三自爱国运动的号召，加强学习，学习时事，学习政治，也有不少的人学习马列主义，因此，也从新学习我们的圣经，特别研究三自：自治，自养，自传，三自中的自传，自传就是在我们素来传的基督教中，发现有帝国主义、封建主义和资本主义的思想毒素，我们自己批判了，也正在批判我们的基督教信仰，消极地肃清反共反苏的思想毒素，积极地建立合乎圣经的基督教真理，基督教本质。我们从新强调耶稣是木匠工人，神的儿子降生成人，生活在世三十三年多就用了二十多年从事劳动，作手工业兼农业，因此提高了劳动的地位，我们作耶稣的信徒也当学耶稣爱劳动，爱劳动生产。从新学习圣经的教训：“若有人不肯作工，就不可吃饭。”从新实践圣经的教训：“从前偷窃的不要再偷（剥削人就是偷窃）总要劳力亲手作正经事，就可有余，分给那缺少的人。”这当然不是说我们再不讲耶稣十字架的救恩，我们仍然讲宝血救赎的道理。我们学习自传不过是更丰富了我们的信仰内容。我们也学习政治经济学，才知道两个经济原则，一：“物质生产是社会的基础，人们要生活，就必须有食物、衣服和其它物质资料。人们要有这些，就必须生产它们，就必须劳动。”第二条：“人们生产物质资料，不是单独进行的，而是以社会为单位来共同进行的，因此人与人必定发生生产的关系，生产关系一定要适合生产的性质的规律。”用这样经济的观点来研究基督教教义，我们发见这些原则也是旧约先知新约使徒和主耶稣所讲的道理，我们基督徒应当照着实行。因此我们很快乐注意到，复活的耶稣，一天早晨，站在加利利湖边，向在湖上打鱼的七个门徒，饥饿寒冷的时候，问他们说：“小子们，你们有吃的没有？”他们上了岸，看见那里主为他们预备了有炭火，上面有鱼又有饼，耶稣说：“你们来吃早饭，”由此可见，主耶稣降世，不但是流宝血，救我们的灵魂，并且劳动生产，供给我们身体的需要。所以我们基督教徒也可以随着佛教徒赵朴初委员所说的与他同说：“我们应当不仅根据我们的义务（公民的义务），而且根据我们的信仰（基督徒也是学习主耶稣的榜样），热爱我们的国家，遵守国家的宪法，更进一步和全国人民团结在一起，积极参加祖国的社会主义建设和保卫世界和平运动。”
    以上不成熟的意见，是在匆忙中写出来的，一定有许多错误，尚请诸位委员指正。（附图片）
