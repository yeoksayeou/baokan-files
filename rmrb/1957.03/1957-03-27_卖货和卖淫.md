　　Selling Goods and Prostitution
    Not long ago, an American magazine called "The Way to Make a Fortune" announced its upcoming publication. According to the publisher of this new magazine, its purpose is to teach people how to get rich. He said that "getting rich" is a manifestation of the "American spirit," and the main secret to success lies in "thinking that adapts to circumstances, extensive networking, bold decisions, and being good at deceiving…". It seems that a "newest" method of promoting goods pioneered by General Electric Company recently, which was called the "newest" by the American press, should become a model of the "American spirit" advocated by this magazine.
    The story is like this: During the trial of a prostitution case in the Manhattan District Court of New York City, two prostitutes confessed that they had "dedicated themselves" to the products of General Electric Company. How could prostitutes be involved with the products of General Electric Company? It turns out that General Electric Company, like other large American companies, believes that "treating major customers well" is the key to developing business. Therefore, the sales company of General Electric Company in New Jersey, based on this belief, rented elaborate suites in luxury hotels and hired two prostitutes from New York, letting them pose as wealthy ladies and young women. Then company employees would bring important customers over, and they would be responsible for "entertaining" them and assisting the company in negotiating transactions. As a result, these two prostitutes greatly helped General Electric Company; it is said that one of them, named Borgart, sold sixteen carloads of goods for her employer by flattering and sacrificing her body.
    It should be said that this new sales technique of General Electric Company is fully in line with the "American spirit" promoted by "The Way to Make a Fortune" magazine. The bosses of this company know the secret to "getting rich" and are good at "thinking that adapts to circumstances," which is why they made such a "bold decision." However, due to the exposure of the scandal, it is not very glorious that the wealthy and powerful General Electric Company is actually involved in the prostitution business of prostitutes. But what can be done when the market is sluggish and goods are not selling well?
    It is worth noting that this well-known large enterprise belonging to the Morgan Consortium actually resorted to this method to promote its products, which more or less illustrates the true picture behind the "prosperity" of the American economy. (Lin)

### 卖货和卖淫

　　卖货和卖淫
    不久以前，美国有一家叫“生财之道”的杂志预告将要出版。据这家新杂志的发行人宣布，杂志的宗旨是教人发财。他说，“发财致富”是“美国精神”的表现，而成功的主要秘诀在于“随机应变的思考，广泛的交往，大胆的决定和善于欺骗……”。看来，最近通用电气公司首创的一种被美国报刊称作“最新式”的推销商品的方法，应该成为这家杂志所标榜的“美国精神”的典范了。
    事情是这样的，纽约市曼哈顿区法院在审讯一件卖淫案中，有两名妓女供认她们曾经先后为通用电气公司的产品“献身”。卖淫的妓女怎会同通用电气公司的产品牵连到一起呢？原来通用电气公司和美国其他大公司一样，认为“招待好大主顾”是发展营业的关键。因此，通用电气公司在新泽西州的售货公司根据这种信念，在豪华大旅馆里租下了讲究的套房，并且从纽约雇来了两名妓女，让她们冒充是阔绰的太太和小姐，然后公司职员将重要主顾引来，由她们负责“招待”，并协助公司谈判交易。结果这两个妓女果然大大地帮助了通用电气公司；据说其中一个叫葆嘉特的妓女，靠了灌迷汤和牺牲色相的办法替她的雇主推销了十六车皮的货物。
    应该说，通用电气公司的这种推销新术完全符合“生财之道”杂志所宣扬的“美国精神”。这家公司的老板们深知“发财致富”的秘诀，善于进行“随机应变的思考”，才会作出这种“大胆的决定”。不过由于丑闻的揭露，有钱有势的通用电气公司竟然同妓女的卖淫事业牵连在一起，总是不大光采的。可是因为市场不景气，商品滞销，又有什么办法呢？
    值得注意的是，这家属于摩根财团的大名鼎鼎的大企业，竟至乞灵于这种方法来推销它的产品，这多少说明了美国经济“繁荣”幕后的真实景象。　（林）
