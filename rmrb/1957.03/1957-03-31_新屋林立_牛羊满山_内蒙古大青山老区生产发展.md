Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, March 30th: The old revolutionary base area of Daqingshan in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which was devastated by the enemy's "Three Alls" policy during the Anti-Japanese War, has seen increasing recovery and development in production, and the people's lives have returned to pre-war levels.

　　The Daqingshan revolutionary base area has abundant coal reserves underground, and the mountains are rich in various trees and medicinal herbs. However, during the Anti-Japanese War, due to the enemy's burning, killing, and looting, almost no houses or cattle were left in a thirty-mile-long mountain gully. After liberation, people of all ethnic groups rebuilt their homes on the ruins, and more than 1,200 new houses have been built in the mountains. People in the Jing'ergou mountainous area used state loans to purchase more than 800 large livestock such as horses and cattle, and also received more than 1,000 sheep from government relief. The 331 members of the Honglian Agricultural Cooperative in Jing'ergou now have enough food grain, and not long ago, they sold more than 240,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.

　　Last winter, the people of Daqingshan used local methods to mine more than 500 tons of coal from the ground, which, in addition to local consumption, also supported other counties. Now the trees on Daqingshan have matured again, and large quantities of timber have begun to be transported from here to various places. Recently, the people in the Jing'ergou mountainous area also wove production tools such as clod crushers (for spring plowing), water buckets, and bamboo baskets to support agricultural production in Wuchuan and other places. In the process of restoring and developing production, the old revolutionary base area has received support from urban, rural, and pastoral areas. Trucks and camel caravans often supply large quantities of cloth and general merchandise to the people in the mountainous areas; the state has also provided a large number of loans to help the people in the mountainous areas restore production.

　　新屋林立  牛羊满山
　　内蒙古大青山老区生产发展
    新华社呼和浩特30日电  在抗日战争时期曾受敌人“三光”政策摧残殆尽的内蒙古自治区大青山革命老根据地，生产日益恢复发展，人民生活已经恢复到战前水平。
    大青山革命老根据地地下蕴藏着大量的煤炭，山上盛产各种树木和药材。但是在抗日战争时期，这里由于受到敌人的烧杀抢，在一条三十里长的山沟里，几乎没有留下一间房，一头牛。解放后，各族人民在残垣废墟上重新建立家园，山里已经修起一千二百多间新房。井儿沟一带山区人民，用国家贷款买进了八百多头马、牛等大牲畜，还得到政府救济的一千多只羊。井儿沟红联农业社的三百三十一户社员，现在都有了足够的口粮，不久以前还卖给国家二十四万斤余粮。
    去年冬天，大青山人民用土法从地下挖出了五百多吨煤炭，除了当地自用外，还支援了外县。现在大青山上的树木又已成材，大量木材开始从这里运往各地。最近，井儿沟山区人民还编制了耱鱼（春耕用）、水斗和箩头等生产用具，支援武川等地农业生产。革命老根据地在恢复和发展生产中，曾得到城市、农村和牧区的支援，汽车和骆驼队经常把大量布匹、百货供应给山区人民；国家也发放了大量贷款帮助山区人民恢复生产。
