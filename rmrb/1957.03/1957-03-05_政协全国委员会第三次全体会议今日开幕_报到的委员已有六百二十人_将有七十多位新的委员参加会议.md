Xinhua News Agency, March 4th. The Third Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will open in Beijing on March 5th.

The issues to be discussed at this plenary session will be very broad. The Second Plenary Session, held at the beginning of last year, took place during the high tide of socialist transformation in our country. Over the past year, many changes have taken place in various aspects of work, and many new situations and new problems have emerged. Last summer and winter, members of the CPPCC National Committee, together with deputies to the National People's Congress, inspected various aspects of work across the country. After the winter inspections were completed, the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee and the Standing Committee of the NPC jointly organized fourteen special issue groups to conduct thorough discussions on the results of the inspections for more than a month. The issues and opinions raised during the discussions will be reflected in this plenary session of the National Committee. This plenary session will, in the spirit of "speaking out freely, saying everything you know" and under the call of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" and "letting a hundred flowers bloom," express different views and engage in democratic discussions to fully发挥the active role of the people's democratic united front.

As of today, 620 members have reported. More than 70 new members will participate in this plenary session, including recently appointed members and newly added specially invited individuals. These new members include representative figures from all fields. The Guangxi delegation, which is in Beijing to consult on the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, will attend this meeting as observers.

This plenary session has undergone thorough preparation. The Standing Committee of the National Committee has held multiple meetings to discuss various issues related to the convening of the Third Plenary Session. Preliminary meetings for the Third Plenary Session were also held on February 25th and March 2nd.

Judging from the preparations, all the administrative work for this plenary session, including the members' food, lodging, transportation, and the allocation of staff, is being carried out in a spirit of simplicity and frugality, saving expenses and avoiding waste as much as possible. The issue of increasing production and practicing economy will also be one of the important topics at this plenary session.

    政协全国委员会第三次全体会议今日开幕
    报到的委员已有六百二十人  将有七十多位新的委员参加会议
    新华社4日讯  中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第三次会议将于3月5日在北京开幕。
    这次全体会议讨论的问题将很广泛。去年年初举行的第二次全体会议是在我国社会主义改造高潮中召开的。一年来，各方面的工作发生了不少变化，出现了许多新的情况、新的问题。去年夏季和冬季，政协全国委员会委员们曾经同全国人民代表大会代表们一起，在全国各地视察了各方面的工作。冬季视察完毕后，政协全国委员会常委会和全国人民代表大会常委会共同组织了十四个专门问题小组，对视察结果进行了为时一个多月的充分的讨论。讨论中提出的问题和意见，将要反映到这次全国委员会全体会议上来。这次全体会议将本着“知无不言、言无不尽”的精神，在“长期共存、互相监督”和“百家争鸣”的号召下，各抒所见，展开民主讨论，充分发挥人民民主统一战线的积极作用。
    到今天止，报到的委员已有六百二十人。这次全体会议将有七十多位新的委员参加，他们是最近补缺的委员和新增加的特别邀请人士。在这些新委员中，包括了各方面有代表性的人士。来京协商关于建立广西僮族自治区问题的广西代表团将列席这次会议。
    这次全体会议经过了充分的准备。全国委员会常务委员会曾经先后举行多次会议，就有关召开第三次全体会议的各项问题进行讨论。2月25日和3月2日下午并且举行了第三次全体会议预备会议。
    从准备情况看来，这次全体会议的一切事务工作，包括委员们的伙食、住宿、交通等方面的费用和对工作人员的调配，都本着简朴节俭的精神，尽可能节约开支，避免浪费。在这次全体会议上，关于增产节约的问题也将是重要的议题之一。
