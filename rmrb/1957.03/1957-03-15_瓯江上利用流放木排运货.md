Xinhua News Agency, Wenzhou, March 14th: Over the past two months, 548 tons of goods have been safely transported from Longquan County to Wenzhou using log rafts on the Ou River in Zhejiang Province.

The method of transporting goods using floating log rafts was successfully tested by the Wenzhou Navigation Management Office at the end of last year. Longquan County is rich in timber, and a large amount of timber is transported downstream to Wenzhou via the Ou River every year, but in the past, the rafts were sent down empty. Lishui, Longquan, and other counties upstream on the Ou River need to transport a large amount of goods via the Ou River to Wenzhou for distribution to various places, but the current in the upper and middle reaches of the Ou River is rapid, the waterway is shallow, and there are many dangerous shoals. A wooden boat takes a month to travel from Longquan to Wenzhou and back, and can only carry one and a half tons of goods. Although there are 900 sailing boats on the Ou River, they are far from meeting the transportation needs, and many goods are backlogged. Now, using floating log rafts to carry goods, each raft can carry six to eight tons of goods. Since adopting this method, not only has the backlog of goods been resolved, but the freight rates for timber and goods have also been reduced by 20%, and it is estimated that more than 70,000 yuan will be saved this year.

### 瓯江上利用流放木排运货

    瓯江上利用流放木排运货
    新华社温州14日电  在浙江省的瓯江上，两个多月来，已经有五百四十八吨物资利用木排从龙泉县安全运到温州。
    利用流放木排载货的办法，是温州航运管理处去年底试验成功的。龙泉县盛产木材，常年有大批木材从瓯江下放到温州，过去都是空排下放的。瓯江上游丽水、龙泉等县，每年有大批物资需要用木船从瓯江运到温州转销各地，而瓯江上、中游水流急，航道浅，险滩多，木船从龙泉到温州往返要一个月，一只船只能载一吨半货。瓯江上虽有九百只航船，但是还远不能满足运输需要，许多货物被积压下来。现在利用流放木排载运货物，每次就可载货六到八吨。采用这个办法以来，不仅解决了物资积压，木材和物资的运价还减少了20％，估计今年将能节约七万多元。
