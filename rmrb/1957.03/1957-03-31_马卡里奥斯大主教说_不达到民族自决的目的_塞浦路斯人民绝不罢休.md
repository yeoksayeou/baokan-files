Xinhua News Agency, 30th: Seychelles Islands dispatch: Archbishop Makarios, leader of the Cypriot national self-determination movement, held a press conference here on March 29th. He pointed out that the Cyprus issue is a matter of Cypriot people’s self-determination. The Cypriot people will "never give up" until they achieve the ultimate goal of national self-determination. He said: "Colonialism belongs to the past, and it has no future in Cyprus."

Makarios said that the British must abolish the emergency regulations used by the security forces to suppress the movement for the union of Cyprus with Greece, and implement an amnesty, in order to "shorten the road to peace." He said that while thousands of Cypriots are sitting in prison or being detained for political crimes, there can be no question of establishing a peaceful situation that would allow negotiations to "resume in a calm atmosphere." He expressed regret that the British authorities "still insist on taking the wrong path" and that "the state of military continues to exist."

Makarios protested against the British government's refusal to allow him to return to Cyprus. He stated that he was not prepared to participate in any political talks until he was allowed to return to Cyprus.

    马卡里奥斯大主教说
    不达到民族自决的目的  塞浦路斯人民绝不罢休
    新华社30日讯　塞舌耳群岛消息：塞浦路斯民族自决运动领袖马卡里奥斯大主教3月29日在这里举行了记者招待会。他指出，塞浦路斯问题是塞浦路斯人民自决的问题。塞浦路斯人民不达到争取民族自决的最终目的“绝不罢休”。他说：“殖民主义是属于过去的了，它在塞浦路斯是找不到前途的。”
    马卡里奥斯说，英国人必须废除保安部队用来镇压塞浦路斯同希腊合并运动的紧急条例，并且要实行大赦，这样来“缩短通往和平的道路”。他说，在成千的塞浦路斯人为了政治罪而坐在监牢里或者被拘留的时候，是谈不到建立一种可以使谈判“在平静的气氛中恢复的和平局势的”。他对英国当局“仍然坚持走错误的道路”，使“军事状态继续存在”仍然表示遗憾。
    马卡里奥斯抗议英国政府不让他回到塞浦路斯去。他表示在他被准许返回塞浦路斯以前，他不准备参加任何政治会谈。
