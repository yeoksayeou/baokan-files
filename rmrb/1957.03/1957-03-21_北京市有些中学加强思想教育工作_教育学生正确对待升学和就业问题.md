Xinhua News Agency, March 20th -- Some middle schools in Beijing have begun to pay attention to educating junior and senior high school students who are graduating this year on how to correctly approach the issues of further education and employment.

These schools have analyzed the current ideological situation of junior and senior students: students are afraid of being blamed by their parents if they fail to get into higher education or find a job. At the same time, some teachers inappropriately increase students' homework and tests, which causes some students to experience excessive mental stress.

In response to this situation, the administrative leaders and Communist Youth League organizations of these schools have established graduation class guidance groups or guidance committees to be responsible for ideological education for students. The principal of Beijing No. 2 Girls' Middle School gave a report to the school's graduating students on how to deal with issues such as further education, employment, and self-study. The school's Youth League organization also asked the League members in junior and senior year classes to demand themselves according to League member standards, correctly treat further education and employment issues, and also introduced the "Successors to Socialist Service Industries," a communication published in the China Youth Daily, to the students. When organizing discussions in a certain junior high school class, everyone agreed that individual interests should be subordinate to collective interests. The entire class unanimously passed a resolution to write an article titled "Our Life Path" to be published on the wall newspaper. Many students from rural families stated in their articles that if they could not get into higher education, they would return to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production with their fathers and brothers. After these efforts, the mood of the graduating students in this school is no longer tense.

When the senior high school students of Beijing No. 21 Middle School discussed the topic of "Whether the country's enrollment plan for this year is reasonable," many students believed that this year's enrollment plan was reasonable. It is impossible for all high school graduates to be admitted to university. Therefore, if they cannot get into higher education, they should plan for employment; if they cannot find employment, they should study at home.

The attitudes of parents have a serious impact on the students' ideological emotions. Some schools have now held parent-teacher conferences, and some teachers have also made detailed home visits. Many parents have expressed their willingness to cooperate with the school to educate their children to correctly deal with the issues of further education and employment. The parent of He Dehua, a third-year junior high school student in one middle school, stated at a parent-teacher conference that if her son did not get into school, she would not scold him and would definitely let him study hard by himself. If an agricultural production cooperative needed people, she would be willing to send her child to participate in labor. However, work in this area still needs to be further developed.

### 北京市有些中学加强思想教育工作　教育学生正确对待升学和就业问题

　　北京市有些中学加强思想教育工作
　　教育学生正确对待升学和就业问题
　　新华社20日讯　北京市有些中等学校的行政和青年团组织，已经开始注意对初中和高中今年就要毕业的学生进行正确对待自己的升学和就业问题的教育。
    这些学校都分析了目前初三、高三学生的思想情况：学生们怕升不了学或找不到工作时，会受到家长的指责。同时，由于一部分教师不适当地增加学生的作业和测验，这样就使一部分学生产生精神过分紧张的现象。
    根据这种情况，这些学校的行政领导和青年团组织都成立了毕业班指导小组或指导委员会，负责对学生进行思想教育。北京市第二女子中学的校长向本校应届毕业生作了如何对待升学、就业、自学等问题的报告；学校团组织也向初三、高三班的团员提出：要以团员的标准来要求自己，正确对待升学、就业问题，同时，还向学生们介绍了中国青年报上的一篇通讯“社会主义服务行业的接班人”。初三某个班在组织讨论时，大家认为个人利益应服从集体利益。全班同学一致通过写一篇“我们的生活道路”在墙报上发表。许多家在农村的学生在文章中表示：升不了学就回到家乡去同自己的父兄一块参加农业生产。经过这些工作以后，现在这个学校毕业班学生的情绪已不再紧张了。
    北京市第二十一中学的高三学生在讨论“今年国家的招生计划是否合理”这个专题时，许多学生都认为今年的招生计划是合理的，不可能所有的高中毕业生都考上大学，因此升不了学就要作就业的打算，不能就业就在家自学。
    对学生们的思想情绪有严重影响的是家长的态度。现在有些学校已经召开了家长座谈会，有些教师还作了细致的家庭访问。不少家长都表示，愿意配合学校教育自己的子女正确对待升学、就业问题。有一个中学初中三年级学生何德华的家长在家长座谈会上表示：假如自己的儿子考不上学校，她决不斥责他，并且一定让他好好自学，如果那一个农业生产合作社需要人，她愿意把孩子送去参加劳动。但是，现在这一方面的工作还有待进一步的开展。
