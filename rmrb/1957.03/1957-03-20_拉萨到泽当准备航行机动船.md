Xinhua News Agency report: The Tibet River Survey Team has returned to Lhasa.

According to the survey, the riverbed of the Lhasa River from Lhasa to Quxu and the Yarlung Tsangpo River from Quxu to Tsetang is relatively flat with few shoals, making dredging relatively easy. Currently, in the dry season, yak-hide boats carrying over 1,000 *jin* can still navigate downstream. The Yarlung Tsangpo River from Tsetang to Nyingchi has a long stretch of rugged terrain, narrow river channels, numerous dangerous reefs, and several places with significant drops in elevation, making it temporarily impassable.

The Tibet Autonomous Region Preparatory Committee's Communications Department is about to begin drafting dredging plans, designing vessels, and preparing to use motorized vessels for navigation on the Lhasa to Tsetang section first.

    拉萨到泽当准备航行机动船
    据新华社讯　西藏河道调查组已经返回拉萨。
    据调查，拉萨河由拉萨到曲水和雅鲁藏布江由曲水到泽当河的河底较平坦，浅滩较少，疏浚比较容易，目前枯水季节，顺流仍可行驶载重一千多斤的牛皮船。雅鲁藏布江由泽当到林芝很长一段地势险峻，河道狭窄，险礁多，有几处落差很大，暂时无法通航。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会交通处，即将着手拟制疏浚计划，设计船只，准备先在拉萨到泽当一段，采用机动的船只航行。
