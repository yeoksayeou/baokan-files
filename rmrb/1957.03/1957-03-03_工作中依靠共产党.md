    Relying on the Communist Party in Work
    Feng Wenbing
    The snow is extremely deep before my window,
    Voices are extremely distant,
    Because the place where I live is like a sanatorium,
    I was originally a patient too,
    Living here so I can work better!
    I work with passion,
    I work with joy,
    For a year, with my sick eyes, my work efficiency has far exceeded when I was a recluse in the old days,
    I let my right eye, which can no longer be healthy, sleep there like a sick child,
    Telling it not to wake up, not to make noise,
    The left eye is like a mother, constantly operating all day long.
    I have a very great wish,
    Which is to ask Communist Party comrades to help me,
    So that the cause I undertake can also achieve perfection,
    I know I will have no effect if I do not rely on the Communist Party members!
    The snow is extremely deep before my window,
    Voices are extremely distant,
    The place where I live is the northeastern border of the motherland,
    I have no longing for my hometown,
    I have no thoughts of family,
    (This is the manifestation of the great socialist system in people's thoughts!)
    My heart is always on work,
    I always think:
    Which Communist Party members are in my work department?
    There are no footprints in the snow before the window,
    I smile:
    I have a warm heart,
    Relying on Communist Party members in work!

    工作中依靠共产党
    冯文炳
    在我的窗前雪极深，
    人声极远，
    因为我住的地方像一个疗养院，
    我本来也是病人，
    住在这里为得我能更好地工作起见！
    我热情地工作，
    我快乐地工作，
    一年以来带着病眼我的劳动效率远远地超过我从前在旧时代做隐士以前，
    我让我的不能再有健康的右眼像个病小孩一样在那里睡着了，
    叫他不要醒不要喧，
    左眼就像母亲在旁边常常操作一个整天。
    我有一个极大的心愿，
    就是要求共产党同志帮助我，
    让我所承担的这份事业也能达到完全，
    我知道我决没有什么作用如果不依靠共产党员！
    在我的窗前雪极深，
    人声极远，
    我住的地方是祖国的东北边，
    我没有故乡之思，
    我没有家庭之念，
    （这是伟大的社会主义制度在人们思想的表现！）
    我一心总在工作上面，
    我总想：
    在我的工作部门有哪些哪些共产党员？
    窗前雪没有人迹，
    我笑着：
    我有一颗温暖的心，
    工作中依靠共产党员！
