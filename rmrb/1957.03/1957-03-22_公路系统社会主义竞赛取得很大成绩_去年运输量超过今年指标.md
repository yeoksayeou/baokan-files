Xinhua News Agency, 20th -- The National Highway System's 1956 All-Industry Socialist Emulation Summary and Appraisal Meeting, held in Beijing, closed on the 19th. The meeting lasted for six days.

The highway system achieved great results in carrying out the socialist emulation drive last year. Automobile transportation workers, faced with a large volume of transport and insufficient capacity, launched the "Safety, Economy, 100,000 Kilometers Without Major Overhaul" movement, saving a large amount of fuel and extending tire mileage. There were 3,210 vehicles nationwide that achieved over 100,000 kilometers without major overhaul. The volume of freight and passenger transport by automobile exceeded the targets for 1957. Highway maintenance workers widely used natural materials to improve 11,000 kilometers of dirt roads, saving more than 90 million yuan. Highway construction workers vigorously promoted advanced experiences, increasing average labor productivity by 25.7% throughout the year. Survey and design workers completed 105% of the design plan, and the average survey and design cost per kilometer was 20% lower than in 1955.

This meeting summarized and exchanged the experiences of the workers in achieving these results. After evaluation, the Ministry of Communications and the China Highway Transportation Trade Union awarded eleven outstanding units in various types of work. The Hunan Provincial Highway Bureau Transportation Bureau, which received the award, actively promoted advanced experiences in the "Safety, Economy, 100,000 Kilometers Without Major Overhaul" movement. Last year, more than 98% of its vehicles saved fuel, and 52.9% of its vehicles achieved over 100,000 kilometers without major overhaul. Passenger transport completed the First Five-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule, and freight transport completed it one year and eight months ahead of schedule. Last year, the Shandong Provincial Department of Communications Highway Bureau mobilized the masses in the emulation drive, utilized natural materials to improve more than 2,000 kilometers of dirt roads, and added protective layers to more than 1,100 kilometers, increasing vehicle speed by 10 to 16 kilometers per hour. In addition, seventy-three advanced grassroots units were commended.

In the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, the representatives attending the meeting studied and discussed specific measures to increase production and practice economy based on the production characteristics of the highway system this year. In transportation, the main tasks are to further leverage the transportation capacity of private transportation tools, increase trailers, promote double-shift transportation, increase vehicle load factors, and carry out the repair of old materials. Highway maintenance mainly focuses on using local materials, improving road conditions, saving road maintenance costs, and strengthening minor repairs and maintenance to increase driving speed. Highway construction and survey design mainly focus on selecting economical and reasonable routes, reducing project costs, comprehensively using improved tools, improving project quality, finding outsourced projects, and rationally using labor.

In order to respond to the central government's call to increase production and practice economy, widely mobilize and organize the masses to implement various measures, and better complete the tasks for 1957, the meeting believes that this year, we should consolidate and continue to promote the existing experiences, overcome shortcomings in our work, and carry out the all-industry socialist emulation drive and the "Safety, Economy, 100,000 Kilometers Without Major Overhaul" movement more comprehensively and deeply.

### 公路系统社会主义竞赛取得很大成绩　去年运输量超过今年指标

　　公路系统社会主义竞赛取得很大成绩
　　去年运输量超过今年指标
    新华社20日讯　在北京举行的全国公路系统1956年全产业社会主义竞赛总结评比会议，19日闭幕。会议共举行了六天。
    公路系统去年开展社会主义竞赛取得很大成绩。汽车运输职工在运量大而运力不足的情况下，开展了“安全、节约、十万公里无大修”运动，节约了大量燃料，延长了轮胎行驶里程。全国出现的十万公里以上无大修的汽车有三千二百一十辆，汽车运输的货运量客运量都超过了1957年的指标。公路养护职工广泛利用天然材料，改善土路一万一千公里，节约九千多万元。公路建筑职工大力推广先进经验，全年平均提高劳动生产率25.7％。勘察设计职工，完成了设计计划的105％，平均每公里的测设费用比1955年降低20％。
    这次会议总结、交流了职工群众取得这些成绩的经验。经过评比，交通部、中国公路运输工会分别各个工种嘉奖了十一个成绩优异的单位。受奖的湖南省公路厅运输局在“安全、节约、十万公里无大修”运动中，积极推广先进经验，去年有98％以上的汽车节约了燃料，有52.9％的汽车达到十万公里以上无大修，客运提前两年、货运提前一年零八个月完成了第一个五年计划。山东省交通厅公路局去年在竞赛中发动群众，利用天然材料，改善了土路二千多公里，加铺保护层一千一百多公里，使汽车行驶时速提高十到十六公里。此外，还表扬了七十三个先进基层单位。
    本着增产节约的精神，出席会议的代表根据今年公路系统的生产特点，研究讨论了增产节约的具体措施。在运输方面主要是进一步发挥民间运输工具的运输力量，增加拖车，推行双班运输，提高车辆实载率，开展修复旧料工作。公路养护主要是就地取材，改善路况，节约养路费用，加强小修、维修、提高行车速度。公路建筑和勘察设计主要是选择经济合理路线，降低工程造价，综合使用改良工具，提高工程质量，寻找外包工程，合理使用劳动力。
    为了响应中央增产节约号召，广泛发动和组织群众贯彻各项措施，更好地完成1957年的任务，会议认为：今年应该巩固和继续推广已有的各项经验，克服工作中的缺点，更全面、更深入地开展全产业社会主义竞赛和“安全、节约、十万公里无大修”运动。
