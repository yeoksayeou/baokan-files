Xinhua News Agency, March 28th, New York Dispatch: Japan's representative to the United Nations, Shunichi Kase, submitted to the United Nations Secretariat on March 26th the resolution passed by the Japanese Senate on March 15th, which called for a halt to atomic and hydrogen bomb tests, and a letter from Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi to Hammarskjöld. In his letter, Kishi stated that the Japanese government sincerely hopes that all member states of the United Nations will seriously consider how to realize the ardent desire of the Japanese people expressed in the Japanese Senate resolution, and hopes that the resolution and the accompanying letter will be distributed within the United Nations.
    United Nations officials had already distributed the Japanese Senate's resolution and Kishi's letter on the same day at the request of the Japanese representative.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 28th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese Red Cross Society today passed a resolution at its national conference calling for a ban on nuclear weapons testing.

    The Japanese Red Cross Society also immediately telegraphed the resolution to the International Committee of the Red Cross, the League of Red Cross Societies, and the Red Cross Societies of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, requesting them to take effective measures to promote a rapid ban on nuclear weapons testing.

    The Japanese public's call for a ban on nuclear weapons testing is growing stronger. Many newspapers have published commentaries opposing British hydrogen bomb tests. The people of Hiroshima, which suffered atomic bomb disasters, held a rally and demonstration today calling for a ban on nuclear weapons.

    A delegation led by Masaharu Matsushita, a special envoy of Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, will depart for London on March 30 to protest British hydrogen bomb tests. The special envoy has received letters from all over Japan expressing support for him.

    Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi stated in the Diet yesterday in response to inquiries that the British government's response rejecting the Japanese government's third call to halt hydrogen bomb testing would not affect his determination to oppose nuclear weapons testing. He pledged to seize every opportunity to prevent any country from testing nuclear weapons.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 28th, London Dispatch: The National Council of the United Free Church Federal Council, meeting in Bristol, passed a resolution yesterday calling on the government to cancel its planned nuclear tests on Christmas Island and to devote itself to the peaceful uses of atomic energy.

    The resolution expressed regret that the United Nations had not made greater progress in reaching an international agreement to ban atomic weapons testing. It called on the church to continue its efforts to reach such an agreement. Meanwhile, the Pure Philosophy Association of Hastings, southern England, after learning that the government insisted on conducting hydrogen bomb tests in the House of Commons on March 26, issued an appeal on behalf of the International Alliance to Protect Life Against Atomic Weapons, headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, which read: "Better to act actively today than to be attacked by radiation tomorrow." Hundreds of members of parliament received this appeal.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 28th, London Dispatch: According to a report in the "News Chronicle" today, Steele, a 63-year-old Quaker from Gloucestershire, and his wife have announced that they will go to Christmas Island when the hydrogen bomb tests are conducted to protest the hydrogen bomb tests. Since their decision was announced, dozens of people have written to support them, and ten of them have expressed their willingness to go with the Steeles.

    According to reports, the elderly couple is determined to abandon their three beloved children and prepare to fly to Japan to board a Japanese protest ship to Christmas Island to face the hydrogen bomb explosion. The old man said: They will protest the government's refusal to cancel hydrogen bomb tests with their lives. (Attached picture)
