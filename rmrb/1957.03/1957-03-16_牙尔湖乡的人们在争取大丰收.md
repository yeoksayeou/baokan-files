    The People of Ya'er Lake Township Strive for a Bumper Harvest
    Hao Jian
    In early spring, February, the land is still frozen, and the cold is relentless, but the production enthusiasm of the members of the Five-Star Agricultural Cooperative in Ya'er Lake Township, Turpan County, is like a blazing fire.
    In the fields, the members are driving fifty carts, constantly transporting manure and soil to the fields. According to statistics on February 22, the entire cooperative accumulated more than 40,000 carts of fertilizer, more than twice as much as last year. Currently, the fertilizer for more than 800 mu of wheat fields has been delivered, and the fertilizer for 2,300 mu of cotton fields is being transported.
    Red flag competitions have been launched between teams, groups, and members. Each team formulates a production plan every ten days or half a month, according to the requirements of the cooperative and the specific conditions of the team, and conducts regular inspections. The members have also made guarantees, guaranteeing no lateness, no early departure, ensuring quality, and completing the plan on schedule. While carrying out the competition, the teams also demonstrated the spirit of mutual assistance. When leveling the field ridges, the third team, in addition to completing its own tasks, also drew 20 people to support the fourth team, which lacked labor, so that the leveling work of the fourth team could also be completed on schedule.
    People standing on the Gobi Desert north of the Five-Star Cooperative can always see groups of three or five members actively repairing and digging karez wells. Some members wear single layers of clothing, roll up their trouser legs, and dig barefoot into the ground sixty or seventy meters deep to dig holes, their whole bodies turning into mud men. They work every day from eight in the morning until five in the afternoon; at noon, they don't go home to eat, but take out dry food from their pockets to eat, and then continue working. Water conservancy committee member Nuerding said: This year's task of repairing and digging karez wells is very heavy. The entire cooperative has twelve karez wells, and each karez well must be repaired and excavated; in addition, five new holes must be dug at the upper end of the karez wells. After these five holes are completed, the water for irrigating 450 mu of land can be increased every month. This is a reliable guarantee for a bumper harvest of crops this year.
    At this time last year, the cooperative did not operate any sideline occupations at all; this year is different, there are cotton gins, water mills, oil presses, and automobile transportation, etc., with a monthly income of more than 13,000 yuan. The increase in sideline income has greatly improved the labor enthusiasm of the members. They have implemented the method of continuous machine operation and shift changes in the cotton ginning workshop, water mill workshop, and oil pressing workshop, working day and night. The sixty-four-year-old Tao Heti is even more vigorous, and he can break the quota every month by ginning 3,000 jin more of seed cotton. He said: "This year, the total output value of the agricultural cooperative will increase a lot compared to last year, and the income from sideline occupations alone will be more than 150,000 yuan. We will not only complete the plan 100%, but also strive to over fulfill it!"
    After more than two months of efforts, the Five-Star Cooperative's 1957 production plan has been formulated. The management committee conducted a detailed survey and analysis of the cooperative's production conditions and potential, and initially drafted a draft plan; then, it convened two meetings of cooperative member representatives, and after repeated discussions, research, supplements, and revisions, it was finally unanimously approved. This year, the Five-Star Cooperative plans: cotton yield of 400 jin per mu, an increase of 33% compared to last year; wheat yield of 200 jin per mu, an increase of 20% compared to last year; the total agricultural and sideline output value of the entire cooperative is more than 700,000 yuan, an increase of 70% compared to last year (the base number of the above percentages is calculated by adding the total average of the two newly merged cooperatives). All the members are working hard and with full confidence to strive for a bumper harvest in 1957.

    牙尔湖乡的人们在争取大丰收
    郝健
    初春的2月，土地还在冻结，寒气不断袭人，可是，吐鲁番县牙尔湖乡五星农业社社员们的生产热情，却像一团团的烈火。
    在田野上，社员们正赶着五十辆大车，川流不息地往地里拉粪送土。据2月22日统计，全社共积肥四万多车，比去年增加了两倍多。目前，八百多亩麦田地的粪土已经拉完，二千三百亩棉花地的粪土正在运送。
    队与队、组与组、社员与社员之间，都展开了红旗竞赛。每个队都按照社里的要求和本队的具体情况，每十天或半月订出生产计划，并经常进行检查。社员们也纷纷提出了保证，保证不迟到，不早退，保证质量，按期完成计划。在开展竞赛的同时，各队之间还发挥了互助互援的精神。在平地埂的时候，第三队除了完成自己的任务以外，还抽出二十人支援缺乏劳动力的第四队，使第四队的平埂工作也能按期完成。
    人们站在五星社北面的戈壁滩上，总可以看见三五成群的社员在积极修挖坎儿井。有的社员穿着单衣，卷起裤腿，打着赤脚，下到六、七十公尺深的地下去挖掘洞子，浑身上下全变成了个泥人。他们每天从早晨八时一直挖到下午五时；中午，他们不回家吃饭，而是从怀里掏出干粮来吃，吃完又继续工作。水利委员奴尔定说：今年修挖坎儿井的任务很大，全社有十二道坎儿井，每道坎儿井都要整修挖土；除此以外，还要在坎儿井的上端新挖五个洞子，这五个洞子完成后，每个月就可增加浇四百五十亩地的水。这是今年农作物大丰收的可靠的保证。
    去年这时候，社里根本就没有经营什么副业；今年可不同了，有轧花、水磨、油坊以及汽车运输等，每月收入可达一万三千多元。副业收入的增加，大大地提高了社员的劳动热情，他们在轧花坊、水磨坊和油坊里都实行了机器不停、轮班换人的方法，不分昼夜地工作着。六十四岁的陶何提老汉，更显得老当益壮，他月月都能突破定额多轧三千斤籽棉。他说：“今年农业社的总产值比去年增加的很多，其中只是副业一项就要收入十五万多元。我们不但要百分之百地完成计划，而且还争取超额完成哩！”
    经过两个多月的努力，五星社1957年的生产计划制定出来了。管委会把社里的生产条件和潜力逐项作了详细的调查和分析，初步拟出计划草案；然后又召开了两次社员代表大会，经过反复地讨论、研究、补充和修改，最后才一致通过。五星社今年计划：棉花每亩地产四百斤，比去年增加33％；小麦每亩地产二百斤，比去年增加20％；全社农、副业总产值为七十多万元，比去年增加70％（以上百分比的基数，是加上新合并进的两个社的总平均数来计算的）。全体社员正在以辛勤的劳动和饱满的信心争取1957年的大丰收。
