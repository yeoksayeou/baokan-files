　　Who Granted the "Privileges"?
    Editor: The workers of the Guye Bauxite Mine in Hebei have many complaints about certain leaders who fail to consciously abide by the rules.

    The higher authorities instructed industrial and mining enterprises that the wage increase for section-level cadres should not exceed 20% of their original salary, and any excess should be corrected, and the overpaid wages should be returned. However, the wage increase for section chiefs and above in this mine's Party branch committee has exceeded 30% of their original salary, and the overpaid wages have not been returned.

    The attendance system of the bauxite mine stipulates that cadres who take personal leave will not be paid; sick leave will be handled according to the labor insurance regulations, with reduced wages. These regulations have been implemented by the administrative department cadres and all workers; however, the personnel of the Party branch have not complied. Wang Qingyun, who works in the general branch, still received his salary when he took personal leave to go home. The labor and wage department has repeatedly expressed their opinions to the general branch committee, but the general branch only replied: "We have to study it." According to factory regulations, family dormitories should provide their own heating equipment, and everyone complied; however, Pan Wenzhi, the secretary of the general branch, and Huo Changyan, the deputy secretary, took the lead in violating this system, installing public stoves and chimneys in their own homes. Wang Fenglin and others, members of the general branch, and newly transferred cadres from other places followed suit under their influence.

    For workers with difficulties, the trade union only provides subsidies of three or five yuan, with a maximum of no more than fifteen yuan; Li Gaoshan, the deputy secretary of the general branch, is not in difficulty, and uses pipes worth twelve yuan, but received a subsidy of sixty yuan. The masses are talking about it, and the impact is extremely bad.

    These opinions have been reported to them more than once, but there has been no resolution. Yu Xilin

　　谁给的“特权”
    编辑同志：河北古冶矾土矿职工群众对某些领导人员不能自觉地遵守制度，意见很多。
    上级指示工矿企业，科长级干部工资上升幅度不得超过本人工资的20％，凡是超过的都应该纠正，多领的工资应该退回。可是这个矿的科长以上支部委员的工资上升幅度都超过本人工资30％，多领的工资也没有退。
    矾土矿的考勤制度规定：凡是干部请事假，不发工资；病假按劳动保险规定减发工资的规定执行。这些规定行政部门的干部和全体工人都执行了；可是党支部的人员就没有遵守。在总支工作的王庆云请事假回家，还要照发工资，劳动工资科几次向总支委员反映意见，总支只答复：“我们得研究研究”。按照工厂规定，家属宿舍取暖设备应自备，人人都遵守；可是总支书记潘文质、副书记霍常彦竟带头破坏这个制度，将公家的炉子、烟筒安在自己家中。总支委员王凤林等人和新由外地调来的干部在他们的影响之下，也都照样作了。
    一般有困难的职工，工会只补给三、五元，最多没超过十五元；总支副书记李高山并不困难，使的烟斗都是价值十二元的，却补给了六十元。群众议论纷纷，影响极坏。
    这些意见，不止一次地给他们反映过，但是没有下落。　于锡霖
