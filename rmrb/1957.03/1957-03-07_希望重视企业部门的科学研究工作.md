Hope to Attach Importance to Scientific Research in Enterprise Departments
Yu Kangjin

Recently, the important role of scientific and technological research in my country's economic construction has been greatly valued. Government ministries and relevant scientific and technological departments are organizing scientific and technological forces, formulating scientific and technological plans for their respective departments, and actively carrying out various scientific and technological research work. However, as far as I know, some factories and mining enterprises have not paid enough attention to further strengthening scientific and technological research. The relevant enterprise leadership departments also rarely educate the leading cadres of factories and mining enterprises on the importance of scientific and technological research in order to encourage them to care about and support this work. Therefore, the phenomenon that some leading cadres and staff members of factories and mining enterprises do not pay attention to scientific and technological work still exists.

As everyone knows, in factories and mining enterprises, the improvement of product quality, the reduction of production costs, and the promotion of new technologies have many complex conditions, such as enterprise management, wage system, and reward system. However, fully utilizing the strength of scientific and technical personnel and improving the level of scientific research are also extremely important conditions. Some enterprise leaders, in order to solve these problems, are only accustomed to using methods such as increasing workers' labor intensity and working overtime, and are not good at using strengthening scientific research to solve these problems. At present, some factories and mining enterprises have many management personnel, but they are unwilling to use specialized talents in laboratories and technical research. The strength of some factory laboratories is not as good as before, and even the laboratory buildings are occupied by other departments and offices. Some enterprises use the strength of scientific and technical personnel in work unrelated to scientific research, such as daily inventory, weekly analysis, settlement meetings, and team accounting, so that some scientific and technical personnel cannot concentrate on scientific research. Some leaders of factories and mining enterprises only require technicians to go deep into life, contact the masses, and help workers summarize and promote experience, but rarely require them to do scientific and technical research. It is necessary to summarize the advanced production experience of workers, and this work also requires the help of technicians, otherwise it will not improve; however, it is one-sided to regard the work of summarizing the advanced production experience of workers as scientific and technological work. Especially in modern industry, it is far from enough to do so alone.

In factories and mining enterprises, the phenomenon of not cherishing the time of scientific and technical personnel is also serious. Some engineers have meetings almost every night, and it is difficult to squeeze out one night a week to read books. After the central government convened the meeting of intellectuals, the working conditions of senior intellectuals have indeed been improved a lot, such as setting up library and reading rooms specifically for engineers and technicians. But the engineers can't spare time to read.

The 20th century is the era when science and technology lead industry. The famous British scientist Bernal once said: "Science used to follow industry, but now it is catching up with industry and leading industry. The status of science in production has been clearly recognized." This new relationship between science and technology and production has been recognized by all advanced countries in the world. In our country, those scientific and technological experts who directly participate in scientific research and far-sighted enterprise leaders have also recognized it. They are actively and enthusiastically supporting and leading the scientific research work of enterprises. However, some leading comrades of enterprises have not yet deeply realized this. They have not yet realized the significant role of science and technology in leading production. Some enterprise leaders lack due interest in scientific research, and limit their leadership of enterprise production to generalities. The reason for this phenomenon is related to their unfamiliarity and lack of understanding of scientific research. At present, in factories and mining enterprises, the slogan of "marching towards science and technology" should be raised louder. Not only should we actively support scientific and technical personnel to explore scientific research work that is beneficial to production and helps technological progress, but also all leaders who are not familiar with science and technology should also study science and technology. Only when they understand science and technology can they truly understand the relationship between science and technology and production. Only in this way can the scientific research work of factories and mining enterprises be carried out relatively quickly. While establishing the necessary central-level scientific research institutions, the central ministries should also take measures to strengthen the scientific research work of the central laboratories of various factories and mining enterprises. If it is difficult to establish a large-scale research institute, it is easier to start by strengthening several factory central laboratories with a foundation. Moreover, some factories originally have better scientific and technological strength and do not leave the production base, so it is convenient to carry out scientific research. Of course, if necessary, these institutions can also be separated from the factory and expanded separately. But no matter how strong the central-level scientific research force is, it cannot solve all the scientific and technological problems that occur in all factories and mining enterprises. It can only solve some larger or common scientific and technological problems that factories and mining enterprises are unable to solve. Therefore, factory and mine laboratories still need to be strengthened.

Due to the application of atomic energy and the automation of production processes, we are facing a new industrial revolution. As a result of automation, manual operation in the production process is simplified; however, full automation in the production process requires workers to have a considerable level of scientific and technological expertise. This requires people to devote more energy to complex scientific research and technical learning. The speed of modern industrial development is amazing. Even if an enterprise seems brand new at the moment, it may be outdated tomorrow. Many of our country's enterprise equipment is relatively old and must be transformed. There are many scientific and technological problems facing us. Some of these problems need to be solved by advanced research institutions such as the Academy of Sciences and universities, some can be concentrated in the central-level research institutions of various ministries, but there must also be a large number of scientific and technological problems that need to be solved by the scientific and technological forces of the factories and mines themselves. Therefore, in addition to directing daily production, the scientific and technical personnel of factories and mines should devote all their efforts to scientific and technical research. The leadership organs at all levels of enterprises should, as far as possible, meet the reasonable requirements put forward by factory and mine technical personnel in the process of scientific research.

Since the national liberation, some factories in our country with a relatively strong technical foundation have carried out a lot of scientific research work. For example, the Nanjing Factory of the Joint State-Private Yongli Chemical Industry Company has carried out a number of technical researches on catalysts, fluidized bed roasting furnaces, and high-pressure vessels for important chemical machinery, and has achieved many results. If the relevant leading departments can better support the scientific research work of this enterprise, they will make more achievements. This type of enterprise is not an isolated case. If the relevant enterprise leadership departments generally attach importance to the scientific research work of enterprises, we have reason to believe that the scientific level of various enterprises will be rapidly improved to meet the requirements of my country's socialist production and construction cause.

    希望重视企业部门的科学研究工作
    俞康金
    近来，科学技术研究工作在我国经济建设中的重要作用被大大地重视了。政府各部和有关科学技术部门，都在组织科学技术力量，制订本部门的科学技术规划，积极开展各项科学技术的研究工作。但据我了解，有些厂矿企业对进一步加强科学技术的研究工作，还注意得不够。有关企业领导部门，也很少向厂矿企业的领导干部进行重视科学技术研究工作的教育，以促使他们来关心和支持这一工作。因此，有些厂矿企业的领导干部和各科室工作人员，不重视科学技术工作的现象仍然存在。
    大家知道，在厂矿企业里，产品质量的提高，生产成本的降低，新技术的推广，固然有很多的复杂条件，如企业管理、工资制度和奖励制度等等，但充分地利用科学技术人员的力量，提高科学研究工作的水平，也是极重要的条件之一。某些企业领导人员，为了解决这些问题，只习惯于用加强工人劳动强度，加班加点的办法，而不善于用加强科学研究工作来解决这些问题。目前，有一些厂矿企业里管理人员很多，却不肯把专门人材用在实验室和技术研究上。有些工厂的实验室力量反而不如从前了，甚至连实验室的房子也被其它科、室所占领。有些企业把科学技术工作人员的力量用在一些和科学研究工作无关的工作上，如日盘存、周分析、结算会议、班组核算等等，使得一些科学技术工作人员不能集中精力从事科学研究工作。也有一些厂矿企业的领导人员，只要求技术人员深入生活，联系群众，帮助工人总结经验推广经验，而对他们的科学技术研究工作则很少要求。工人的先进生产经验是必须总结的，这项工作也需要技术人员的帮助，否则就不会提高；但是把总结工人先进生产经验的工作看成就是科学技术工作，那是片面的。特别是现代工业，仅仅这样做已经很不够了。
    在厂矿企业中，不爱惜科学技术人员的时间的现象也是严重的。有些工程师几乎每天晚上都有会，一个星期难得挤出一晚上时间看看书。中央召开知识分子会议以后，对高级知识分子的工作条件确实有了不少改进，譬如专门为工程师、技术员设立了图书资料室和阅览室。但工程师们抽不出时间去阅读。
    二十世纪是科学和技术带领工业的时代，英国著名的科学家贝尔纳曾说过：“早先是科学跟随工业，现在它正在赶上工业，带领工业，科学在生产中的地位被清楚地认识到了。”科学技术对生产的这种新关系，已经为世界各先进国家认识到了。在我国，那些直接参加科学研究的科学技术专家和有远见的企业领导者，也认识到了。他们正积极热情地去支持和领导企业的科学研究工作。但有些企业领导同志，还没深刻地认识到这一点。他们还没有认识到科学技术带领生产的重大作用。有些企业领导者对科学研究还缺少应有的兴趣，对企业生产限于一般化的领导。产生这种现象的原因，是和他们不熟悉和不懂得科学研究工作有关系的。目前在厂矿企业中，应当把“向科学技术进军”的口号提得更响亮，不仅要积极支持科学技术人员去探讨对生产有益的、有助于技术进步的科学研究工作，而且一切还不熟悉科学技术的领导人员，也要学习科学技术。只有当他们懂得了科学技术，才能真正了解科学技术和生产的关系。只有这样，才能比较迅速地开展厂矿企业的科学研究工作。中央各部在建立必需的中央级科学研究机构的同时，还应当采取措施加强各个厂矿企业的中央实验室的科学研究工作。如果说建立一个大型的研究所比较困难，而先从加强几个有基础的厂矿中央实验室做起，则是比较容易的。况且有些工厂原来就有较好的科学技术力量，又不脱离生产基地，开展科学研究工作是有许多方便之处的。当然，如有必要，这些机构也可以脱离工厂而单独扩大。但不管中央级的科学研究力量如何强大，它不可能解决一切厂矿企业中发生的科学技术问题。它只能解决一些厂矿企业所无力解决的较大的或者共同性的科学技术问题。因此，厂矿实验室仍需加强。
    由于原子能的应用和生产过程的自动化，使我们面临着新的工业革命。自动化的结果，生产过程中的人工操作简单化了；但生产过程中的充分自动化，却需要劳动者有相当的科学技术水平。这就要求人们以更多的精力从事复杂的科学研究和学习技术。现代工业发展的速度是惊人的，即使在眼前看来是全新的企业，明天也许就又落后了。我国的很多企业设备本来是比较陈旧的，必须改造。有很多科学技术问题摆在我们面前。其中有些问题需要高级研究机关如科学院和高等学校去解决，有些问题可以集中在各部的中央级研究机构解决，但也必然还有大量的科学技术问题需要厂矿本身的科学技术力量去解决。因此，厂矿的科学技术人员除了指挥日常生产外，应当全力进行科学和技术的研究工作。企业的各级领导机关，应当尽可能满足厂矿技术人员在科学研究过程中所提出的合理要求。
    自从全国解放以来，我国某些技术力量较有基础的工厂，已经进行了不少科学研究工作。如公私合营永利化学工业公司南京厂，就进行过触媒、沸腾层焙烧炉、重要化工机械高压容器等多项技术研究，并且取得了不少成绩。如果有关领导部门对这个企业的科学研究工作能够更好地加以支持，他们将会作出更多的成绩来。这种企业也还不是个别的。如果有关企业领导部门，普遍重视企业的科学研究工作，我们有理由相信，各企业的科学水平会很快提高，以适应我国社会主义生产建设事业的要求。
