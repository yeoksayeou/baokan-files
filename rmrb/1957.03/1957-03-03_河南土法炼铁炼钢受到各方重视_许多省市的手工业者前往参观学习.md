Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 2nd. Henan Province's indigenous iron and steelmaking has aroused great interest throughout the country. Relevant departments are vigorously supporting it from all aspects.

In Shangcheng, the concentrated production area of indigenous iron and steelmaking, many handicraft workers from various provinces and cities have recently come to visit, exchange experiences. The Henan Provincial Department of Industry and the Henan Provincial Handicraft Industry Federation have received a large number of letters from all over the country in the past month, many of which request the introduction and dissemination of indigenous iron and steelmaking methods. The Steel Bureau of the State Planning Commission's Heavy Industry Bureau has also begun to collect and study the situation and problems of indigenous iron and steelmaking in Henan Province. The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives has specially allocated funds for the development of indigenous ironmaking.

Zhao Wenfu, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Party Committee Secretariat and Deputy Governor of Henan Province, is now personally leading this work. The Henan Provincial Department of Industry recently dispatched a working group of more than 20 people, including engineers and technicians, to various places to summarize the experience of indigenous smelting and help improve technology. In March, the province will hold its first ironmaking plant conference to uniformly study and arrange iron and steelmaking work.

Indigenous iron and steelmaking work has been neglected in the past. Although the six ironmaking plants under the Henan Provincial Department of Industry, which use indigenous smelting methods, produced wrought iron of very good quality in the past, which can be used to replace low-carbon steel allocated uniformly by the state and which is very difficult to obtain; and the cost is low, less than half the cost of low-carbon steel. However, due to the lack of serious guidance and assistance from relevant departments for a long time, these factories are still using equipment and smelting technology from more than 300 years ago, resulting in a continuous inability to increase production. Recently, after the help and research of the engineering and technical personnel of the Department of Industry, merely from aspects like fuel and furnace a slight improvement was made, and without adding any machinery or equipment, production can be increased by about two times.

### 河南土法炼铁炼钢受到各方重视  许多省市的手工业者前往参观学习

    河南土法炼铁炼钢受到各方重视
    许多省市的手工业者前往参观学习
    新华社郑州2日电  河南省土法炼铁炼钢引起了全国各地极大的兴趣。有关方面正从各方面大力支援。
    在土法炼铁炼钢的集中产区——商城，最近有许多省市的手工业者来参观访问、交流经验。河南省工业厅和河南省手工业联合社一个多月来共收到了各地寄来的大批信件，其中有不少是要求介绍和传播土法炼铁炼钢的炼制办法。国家计划委员会重工业局钢铁处也已开始着手搜集和研究河南省土法炼铁、炼钢的情况和问题。中华全国手工业合作总社筹备委员会为发展土法炼铁专门拨来了资金。
    中共河南省委书记处书记、河南省副省长赵文甫现在已亲自动手领导这个工作。河南省工业厅最近并派出了一个由工程师、技术员等二十多人组成的工作组，到各地总结土法冶炼经验，帮助提高技术。在3月份，全省将召开第一次炼铁厂会议，统一研究和安排炼铁炼钢工作。
    土法炼铁炼钢工作，过去一向被人忽视。河南省工业厅所属六个采用土法冶炼的炼铁厂虽然过去生产的熟铁，质量很好，可以用来代替全国统一分配的、来源十分困难的低炭钢；而且成本低廉，还不及低炭钢成本的一半。但是由于长期以来有关部门没有认真地指导帮助，直到现在这几个厂还沿用着三百多年前的设备和冶炼技术，致使产量一直不能提高。最近，经过工业厅的工程技术人员帮助研究后，仅仅从燃料、炉子等方面略加改进，不需增添任何机器设备就能够把产量提高两倍左右。
