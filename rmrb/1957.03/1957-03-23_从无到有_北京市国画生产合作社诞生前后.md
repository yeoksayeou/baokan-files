From Scratch
The Birth of the Beijing Guohua Production Cooperative
Zhai Fengnan

(I)
　　There are approximately three hundred Guohua (traditional Chinese painting) artists in Beijing. Nearly all those with a certain level of technical skill or theoretical knowledge have joined the Beijing Guohua Research Association. By the beginning of 1956, membership had reached two hundred and eighty. The association is an academic research institution and does not primarily engage in business operations. Some members have jobs, but nearly a third do not have formal employment. They are professional painters with unstable incomes. Except for a few who have no problem making a living, most do not have sufficient income and face considerable difficulties. After the high tide of socialist transformation in early 1956, how to arrange for these Guohua artists became an important issue for the cultural authorities at the time. In particular, the leaders of the Artists Association and the relevant heads of the Guohua Research Association decided, after many consultations, to organize the Guohua artists in Beijing (mainly the members of the Guohua Research Association) to engage in business. Only by engaging in business could everyone's livelihood be solved, thereby arranging employment for them.
　　Being organized was welcome news for the Guohua artists, but creating something from nothing was not easy. Who would lead, what organizational form would be adopted, and personnel issues, funding issues, and even address issues could not be resolved quickly. Therefore, it was delayed for half a year until September, when it was roughly determined: to establish the "Beijing Guohua Production Cooperative," directly led by the Beijing Arts and Crafts Joint Cooperative (hereinafter referred to as the Joint Cooperative). At the same time, members of the Guohua Research Association were encouraged to sign up. Old painters such as Yu Feian, Pu Xuezhai, Qin Zhongwen, and Wang Shensheng took the lead in signing up, further promoting the effort. By the formal establishment on September 12, a total of one hundred and sixty-nine people had signed up, including seventy-two who did not have jobs. At the inaugural meeting, nine members were elected to form a committee to lead the cooperative's affairs, and Mr. Ma Boyi was publicly elected as director, and I was elected as deputy director. In addition, one business officer was elected from the members. Mr. Ma is an old painter with extremely high artistic attainments, so it was decided not to have him leave his job, and only I and business officer Comrade Li Shuren were detached from our regular work to manage the cooperative's affairs. In order to run the cooperative frugally, even though it was a cooperative with one hundred and sixty-nine people, there were actually only two cadres.
　　Before the cooperative was established, the heads of the Municipal Bureau of Culture and the Joint Cooperative had exchanged views on the organization of the cooperative:
　　　　1. Although the cooperative was established for painters without jobs, it should also take care of amateur painters who have certain skills but already have jobs. Members can be divided into professional and part-time, but professional members should be given as much consideration as possible in terms of business.
　　　　2. Most cooperatives have centralized production or concentrated production in certain areas, and very few have completely decentralized production. Due to the particularity of Guohua artistic creation, there is no need for centralization, and a completely decentralized form can be adopted. Members still produce at home.
　　We organized according to these two decisions.

(II)
　　Although the cooperative was nominally established, the address had not yet been found. After much effort, a few small rooms were finally found as the cooperative's address through the efforts of all members, and business began in early October.
　　Other handicraft cooperatives are made up of small business owners and craftsmen. They have some funds, some production tools, and some office supplies. We are different. Painters have nothing but a few brushes. Money is needed to start the business. Although members have to pay membership fees and buy shares, there is no business when the cooperative is established, so members have no income, and membership fees and shares cannot be collected. Although the director of the Joint Cooperative promised at the inaugural meeting to allocate 10,000 yuan of funds to us, it was later changed to a loan when we received it. In this way, we considered the burden of interest, and as a result, we only borrowed 1,500 yuan from the Joint Cooperative in three installments.
　　Before the cooperative was established, there was no certainty about the business, but monthly expenses were necessary. It was estimated that there might be a period of losses, and members would not have much income. Unexpectedly, due to the attention of all parties, especially after the publication of the People's Daily editorial "Develop Guohua Art" on October 30, business gradually became active, and there were no losses in October. At the end of the year, the accounting situation was as follows:
　　October business income 2,740 yuan
　　November business income 4,570 yuan
　　December business income 5,298 yuan
　　Total business income for 1956: 12,608 yuan
　　It can be seen that the business is gradually increasing, and the income in December is almost double that of October. The total income of the members in three months was 10,032 yuan, while the expenses for three months, including start-up costs, only used 890 yuan. In addition, some necessary items were purchased (the furniture was borrowed from the members), so the net profit at the end of the year was 922 yuan, which was also beyond our expectations. In addition to paying off the 1,500 yuan loan to the Joint Cooperative, the 1956 surplus has been completely transferred to the basic fund through the committee and will no longer be distributed, which has been approved by the Joint Cooperative.
　　According to the business situation, the income of the members is also relatively increasing month by month:
　　　　In October, seventy-seven people were put into production, with an income of 2,232 yuan, and the average wage was 28.99 yuan.
　　　　In November, seventy-one people were put into production, with an income of 2,665 yuan, and the average wage was 37.53 yuan.
　　　　In December, seventy-six people were put into production, with an income of 5,135 yuan, and the average wage was 67.56 yuan.
　　Among them, the number of individuals with income exceeding 100 yuan was only four in November, and there were seventeen in December, and these seventeen people accounted for seven who exceeded 150 yuan.
　　Taking September 1956 as another example, the cooperative had not yet been formally established at that time, and only relied on some business allocated by the Guohua Research Association, with a total income of 1,880 yuan. After deducting 5% for the public accumulation fund, the remaining was 1,786 yuan. The average wage for the seventy people put into production was only 25.51 yuan. Comparing the two, it can be seen that the income of the members has increased significantly after the establishment of the cooperative.
　　The products in these three months were mainly small works such as New Year cards, bookmarks, and gift cards, as well as hanging pictures for exhibitions and decorative paintings on gauze lanterns sent to distinguished guest President Sukarno. The content was all national-style traditional Guohua.
　　Because we produce according to sales, the phenomenon of finished product backlog does not occur. The wages of the members are calculated according to the number of pieces, and are paid every half month, which facilitates their living expenses. In the three months of personal experience, in addition to feeling grateful to the government, everyone felt the superiority of being organized.

(III)
　　As early as last November, the superiors asked us to formulate the production plan for this year. Based on the business situation at that time last year, plus the problems that may occur this year, we compiled the production plan for this year, which was 50,700 yuan for the whole year. However, judging from the order of 300,000 bookmarks (for export) accepted in the initial nine months of this year, this item alone has exceeded the target of the estimated annual production this year. In addition, with other businesses that have been fixed, the total will reach 100,000 yuan, which is almost double the original plan. It is estimated that this number can be completed this year if there are no changes due to other reasons. Now the members are working hard to strive for more accumulation for the cooperative at the end of the year.
　　Last year, there were 169 members, but only 85 were actually engaged in production, accounting for 50% of the total number of members (the rest were unwilling to accept work because they had other jobs or disliked the low remuneration). This year, there are 182 members, and more than 120 have participated in production. On the one hand, the awareness of the members has been improved, and they can unconditionally accept the tasks assigned by the cooperative; on the other hand, the price of the works has been increased compared with the past (the prices ordered by some units in the past were not completely reasonable, and Guangming Daily reported on it, and Mr. Yu Feian also published an article in the People's Daily), which also stimulated the enthusiasm of the members.
　　In order to avoid disputes with the ordering unit on the quality, we adopted the method of sample selection for large-scale businesses. First, according to the specified specifications, a variety of samples were drawn and submitted to the other party for selection. The selected ones were drawn according to the sample. Although this method has great limitations, it can basically guarantee the quality standard. If the finished product drawn by the member is not up to the level of the sample, they are responsible for it; if it is equal to the level of the sample, the other party will not refuse to accept it, so there has been no dispute over returns in the past few months.
　　The members' enthusiasm for work is increasing day by day, and the vast majority can complete or complete the tasks assigned by the cooperative ahead of schedule. They do not argue about the amount of remuneration for each business, and they regard the ability to complete the task as the primary responsibility. For example, a huge map for the recent National Agricultural Exhibition was worked on by ten members for ten days, plus two all-nighters (calculated according to the workload, it would take ten people a month to complete), and was finally completed on the day of the official exhibition.
　　The members' enthusiasm is constantly improving, which can also be seen from the situation of purchasing public bonds. The quota assigned to the literary and art circles branch of the Beijing Public Bond Promotion Committee this year was 3,300 yuan, and in the actual purchase, in addition to the 440 yuan purchased by thirteen non-members, the eighty-three members (those with jobs purchased in their affiliated units) purchased a total of 5,016 yuan, exceeding the quota by more than 65%, which was also a phenomenon that had not occurred in the past.
　　In general, our cooperative has been established for half a year, and thanks to the support of all parties, we have not encountered any major difficulties in terms of funds, business, or raw materials. The more tasks we accept, the more enthusiastic the members are.

(IV)
　　Although our cooperative has achieved some of the above-mentioned achievements and is still developing, there are also quite a few shortcomings due to lack of experience. For example, regarding the welfare matters of the members, in addition to establishing a mounting workshop to solve the members' difficulties in mounting paintings, almost no other welfare matters have been done. This is because the cooperative was just established last year, and the year-end surplus was small, so there could not be a large amount of funds. Secondly, the income of the members is also very unbalanced. Some earn more than 100 yuan per month, some only earn more than 20 yuan per month, and some have no income at all per month (most of those with no income have other jobs and have no time to paint in their spare time; those with low income have skills that do not meet the requirements of the ordering unit). We are trying to find ways to enable every member to earn income. To solve this problem, we plan to establish a retail department to sell the Guohua created by the members. Some people still think that our cooperative can only draw small arts and crafts items such as bookmarks, which is not correct. No matter which member in our cooperative, they have at least ten years of painting experience. In previous Guohua exhibitions, including national Guohua exhibitions, most of their works were selected. After the retail department is established, this not-so-correct view can naturally be reversed. At the same time, the income of the members can also be generally increased.
　　In addition, we also plan to hold an exhibition of members' works within this year.
　　Our cooperative is not growing from small to large, but only from scratch, and is only beginning to take shape. It is said that our cooperative is the first to be established in the country. In the past six months, we have also explored some experiences, and what is written above is a brief and unsystematic description of its establishment. We are extremely willing to exchange experiences and learn from each other with fellow brothers in various places. We believe that any criticism and suggestion to our cooperative is an unparalleled expression of valuable and friendship. Let us work together to cultivate the beautiful flower of the motherland—the Guohua cause—more luxuriantly.

　　从无到有
　　北京市国画生产合作社诞生前后
　　翟奉南
　　（一）
    北京的国画家们，共约有三百人左右，凡有一定技术水平或理论水平的，几乎都参加了北京国画研究会，所以在1956年初，会员已达到二百八十人。该会是学术研究的机构，不以业务经营为主。会员里面有一部分是有工作岗位的，也还有将近三分之一的人还没有正式职业，他们都是职业画家，收入不固定，除去个别的生活没有问题外，一般的生活不充裕甚至还相当困难。在1956年初社会主义改造高潮到来之后，如何安排这些国画家，成为文化主管部门当时一项重要的议题，特别是美协领导方面和国画研究会有关负责人，经过多次协商，才决定把北京市的国画家们（主要是国画研究会的会员）组织起来搞业务，只有搞业务才能解决大家的生活问题，从而使他们得到安排。
    组织起来，对于国画家们来说，是一个可喜的消息，但是从无到有，也不是一件容易的事。由谁来领导，采用什么组织形式，以及人事问题、资金问题、甚至地址问题，都不是能够很快解决的，所以延迟了半年，直到9月才算大体确定：决定成立“北京市国画生产合作社”，由北京市工艺美术品联合社（以下简称联社）直接领导，同时发动国画研究会的会员报名。老画家于非暗、溥雪斋、秦仲文、汪慎生先生等都带头报名入社，更起了推动作用。到9月12日正式成立，报名的共有一百六十九人，其中没有工作岗位的七十二人。在成立大会上推举出委员九人组织委员会，领导社务，并公选马伯逸先生为主任，我为副主任，另由社员中推选业务员一人。马先生是老画家，又有极高的艺术造诣，所以决定不让他脱产，只由我和业务员李树人同志脱产管理社中事务。为了勤俭办社，虽然是拥有一百六十九人的一个社，实际干部只有两个人。
    在社未成立之前，市文化局和联社的负责人对于社的组织，就交换过意见：
        一、合作社虽然是为了没职业的画家而
    成立的，但也要照顾到虽有工作岗位而具有一定技术的业余画家们。社员可分为专业和兼业两种，但在业务上要尽量照顾专业社员。
    二、一般合作社都是集中生产或是分片集中生产，很少是完全分散生产的，由于国画艺术创作的特殊性，没有集中的必要，可采取完全分散的形式，社员们仍旧在家中生产。
    我们就根据这两项决定，进行组织。
　　（二）
    社在名义上虽然成立了，社址却还没有找到，于是又费了一番周折，终于在全体社员努力下找到了几间小房作为社址，并在10月初开始营业了。
    旁的手工业合作社，都是一些小业主和手工业者集合起来的，他们有些资金、有些生产工具、也有办公用具。我们则不然，画家除去几枝毛笔外，什么也没有。开办时就需要钱，虽然社员要交股金和入社费，但社成立时还没有业务，社员也就没有收入，股金和入社费都收不进来。在成立大会上联社主任虽然答应拨给我们一万元资金，但是后来领取时，又改为贷款了。这样我们就考虑到利息负担问题，结果前后三次只由联社贷了一千五百元。
    在社未成立时，业务没有把握，而每月的开支是必需的，估计可能要有一个时期赔钱，社员也不会有很多的收入。不料由于受到各方面的重视，特别是10月30日人民日报社论“发展国画艺术”发表以后，业务逐渐活跃起来，10月份就没有赔钱。至年末结账，情况是这样的：
    10月份营业收入　二千七百四十元
    11月份营业收入　四千五百七十元
    12月份营业收入　五千二百九十八元
    总计1956年度营业收入一万二千六百零八元
    可见营业是逐步上升的，12月份几乎是10月份收入的一倍。三个月中社员总收入是一万零三十二元，而三个月的开支包括开办费在内才用去八百九十元，另外购置了一些必需的物品（家具都是向社员借用的），所以到年末获纯益九百二十二元，这也是出乎我们意料之外的。除去欠联社的贷款一千五百元早经还清外，1956年的盈余已经通过委员会全部转为基本基金，不再分配，已获得联社批准。
    根据业务情况，社员收入也是相对地逐月增加：
        10月份投入生产的七十七人，收入二千二百三十二元，平均工资为二十八点九九元。
        11月份投入生产的七十一人，收入二千六百六十五元，平均工资为三十七点五三元。
        12月份投入生产的七十六人，收入五千一百三十五元，平均工资为六十七点五六元。
    其中个别收入超过一百元的11月份只有四人，12月份已有十七人，而这十七人中超过一百五十元的又占七人。
    再以1956年9月为例，那时社尚未正式成立，只靠国画研究会分配的一些业务，共收入一千八百八十元，从其中减除公积金5％外，余一千七百八十六元。投入生产的七十人，平均工资只为二十五点五一元。两相比较，可见社成立后，社员的收入是有显著的提高。
    这三个月中的产品，主要是画贺年片、书签、礼物片一些小件的作品，也有展览用的挂图和送给贵宾苏加诺总统的纱灯上的装饰画，内容都是民族形式传统的国画。
    因为我们是以销定产，所以不发生成品积压的现象。社员的工资是按件计值的，每半个月发一次，这样可以便利他们的生活使用。社员在三个月的亲身体验中，除了对政府怀着感激的心情外，每个人都感到组织起来的优越性了。
　　（三）
　　早在去年11月，上级要我们制订本年度的生产计划，我们根据去年当时的业务情况，加上今年可能发生的问题，编制了本年度的生产计划，全年是五万零七百元。但从本年度初期接受的九个月中生产书签三十万张的订货（外销用）来看，只这一项就超出了本年度全年预计生产的指标。再加上其它已经固定下来的业务，总计将达十万元，几乎超过了原计划的一倍。估计本年度如没有因其它原因而发生变化，这个数目是可以完成的。现在社员们正为争取合作社在年末有较多的积累在辛勤地劳动着。
    去年有社员一百六十九人，实际搞生产的只有八十五人，占社员总数50％（其余的因另有工作岗位，有的嫌报酬低不愿接受工作）。本年度有社员一百八十二人，而参加生产的已达一百二十人以上。一方面是社员的觉悟提高，对于社分配给的任务能够无条件的接受；另一方面作品价格较前有所提高（过去有些单位所订的价格不尽合理，光明日报曾有报道，于非暗先生也在人民日报发表过文章），也激发了社员的积极性。
    为了避免与订货单位对质量的争执，我们对于大批业务采取了选样的办法，先按规定规格，画成多种多样的样品，交由对方选择，入选的即依样绘制。这个办法虽然有很大的局限性，但基本上可以保证了质量标准。社员画的成品如不及样张的水平，要由自己负责；如与样张水平相等，对方就不会不收，所以几个月来没发生过退货的纠纷。
    社员的工作热情是日益增长的，绝大部分对社所分配的任务都能按期完成或提前完成。对于每项业务代价的多寡也不争论，他们以能完成任务看做是首要责任。例如最近全国农业展览会一幅巨幅地图，十位社员搞了十天，还加了两个通宵（按工作量计，十个人需要一个月才能画成），终于在正式展览之日完成了。
    社员的积极性不断提高，由认购公债的情况上也可以看出来。今年北京市公债推销委员会文艺界分会分配给国画界的预定认购数字是三千三百元，而在实际认购时除去非社员十三人认了四百四十元外，社员八十三人（有工作岗位的在其所属单位认购）共认购了五千零一十六元，计超额了65％以上，这也是过去所没有的现象。
    总的来说，我们的社成立了半年，由于各方面的支持，无论在资金、业务、原料上都没有遇到什么大的困难。我们接受的任务越多，社员的工作越起劲。
　　（四）
    虽然现在我们的社有了上述的一些成绩，并且还正发展着，但是因为经验不足，缺点也相当的多。例如对社员的福利事项，除去成立一个裱画作坊用来解决社员裱画困难外，其它的福利事项几乎没有做，这是因为去年初创，年末盈余不多，不能有大量基金的原因所致。其次社员的收入也非常不平衡，有的每月超过百元，有的每月只二十余元，还有每月并无收入的（无收入的大部分是另有工作岗位，无暇业余作画；收入少的是技巧不符合订购单位的要求）。我们正在设法使每一个社员都能获得收入。解决这个问题，我们准备成立一个门市部，出售社员创作出来的国画。现在还有人认为我们社只能画些书签一类的工艺美术小品，这是不正确的。我们社里不论哪一个社员，起码都有十年以上的画龄了。在历届各项国画展览包括全国国画展览在内，他们中有大多数的作品入选。门市部成立后，自然可以扭转这种不太正确的看法。同时社员收入也可普遍增加。
    另外我们也准备在本年度内举办一次社员作品展览会。
    我们的社还不是由小而大，而只是从无到有，才初具规模。据闻，我们的社就全国范围来说，还是首先成立的一个。六个月来我们也摸索到一些经验，上面写的就是它成立前后不够系统的简括情况。我们极愿意与各地的同行兄弟组织交流经验，互相学习。对于我们社的任何批评与建议，我们认为都是无比的宝贵和友谊的表示。让我们共同努力，把祖国美丽的花朵——国画事业，培育得更加繁茂罢。
