Xinhua News Agency—After extensively and thoroughly visiting the coastal defense, border defense, and construction troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the comfort missions jointly formed by people from various regions and leading organs of the garrison have mostly returned to their respective places.

　　The comfort work in various regions started around the Spring Festival. When the comfort missions arrived, many ships and companies published wall newspaper special editions and decorated them with colorful arches made of gathered branches. Officers and soldiers stationed on a certain island near Shanghai waited in the wind and rain early in the morning, and at night, they held umbrellas and lanterns to accompany their loved ones along the muddy roads to the camp. When the comfort mission from the Zhoushan area braved a Force 6 gale to arrive at the Shengsi Islands, the officers and soldiers jumped into the icy sea and built a pontoon bridge to welcome their loved ones off the landing craft. Before the arrival of the comfort missions, many troops put forward the slogan "Report to our loved ones with excellent results" and worked and studied even more diligently.

　　The personnel of the comfort missions in various regions showed great enthusiasm during the comforting activities. In the coastal defense outposts of Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and other provinces, the comfort mission personnel braved strong winds and huge waves, traveled across barren mountains and remote islands, and comforted the coastal defense soldiers. In the coastal provinces of the north, the comfort mission personnel braved the cold and trudged through the snow to meet the comforted soldiers. Many comfort mission personnel lived in tunnels and slept in straw sheds with the soldiers, and when the soldiers were repairing fortifications, they also participated in the labor. The actors of the front-line drama troupe and the Shanghai People's Acrobatic Troupe who were comforting in the Zhoushan area performed outdoors for the soldiers in the freezing nights around zero degrees Celsius every day. The members of the various cultural troupes, in the intervals of their intense performances, also took turns sewing quilts and mending clothes for the soldiers.

　　The comfort missions in various regions held comfort rallies, report meetings, and symposiums, conveying the care and respect of the people of the whole country to the officers and soldiers, and introduced the achievements of the motherland's construction undertakings. They also went in groups to the positions, sentry posts, ships, and other places to have cordial conversations with the soldiers. The comfort missions also sent a large number of comfort letters and comfort goods to the officers and soldiers of the troops. The Shanghai student delegation established a club named "Friendship Home" for the troops stationed on Dachen Island, which contained a large number of books, picture albums, and sports and entertainment equipment brought by the delegation, including a handwritten collection of poems created by the students of Class 1, Grade 4 of East China Normal University.

　　The soldiers accepted the comfort of their loved ones with excitement. They reported to their loved ones their achievements in combat, duty, and training, and also used the pigs they raised and the vegetables they grew to entertain their loved ones. The coastal artillery, anti-aircraft artillery, and radar soldiers on the coastal defense line demonstrated weapon operation techniques for the comfort mission, the Air Force pilots performed jet plane aerobatics, and the military dogs raised by the border defense soldiers also performed. The soldiers' performance teams of various troops performed literary and artistic programs reflecting combat life for the comfort mission.

　　When the comfort missions left the troops, they received a large number of letters. The soldiers expressed in their letters: We will resolutely defend the socialist construction of the motherland and defend the happy life of the people of the whole country to thank our loved ones for their comfort!

    慰问团走遍荒山僻岛
    慰问海防边防和施工部队
    新华社讯  由各地人民和驻军领导机关联合组成的慰问团，向中国人民解放军海防、边防、施工部队进行了普遍深入的慰问以后，绝大部分已经陆续返回原地。
    各地的慰问工作是在春节前后分别开始的。当慰问团到达的时候，许多舰艇和连队出版了墙报特刊，用采集的树枝扎起了彩门。驻在上海附近某海岛的部队官兵们，大清早就在风雨中迎候，夜晚撑着雨伞、提着油灯陪同亲人们沿着泥泞的道路走向营地。当舟山地区的慰问团冒着六级大风来到了溗沙列岛，官兵们跳进冰冷的海水里，搭起浮桥，迎接亲人们走下登陆艇。许多部队的官兵们在慰问团到来以前，提出了“用优良的成绩向亲人汇报”的口号，更加勤奋地从事工作和学习。
    各地慰问团人员在慰问中表现了极大的热忱。在浙江、福建、广东等省的海防前哨，慰问团人员冒着狂风巨浪，走遍荒山僻岛，慰问了海防战士。在北方沿海各省，慰问团人员冒寒踏雪，长途跋涉，同被慰问的战士们见了面。许多慰问团人员同战士们一起住坑道、宿席棚，当战士们修工事的时候也一起参加劳动，在舟山地区慰问的前线话剧团和上海人民杂技团的演员们，每天都在零度左右的寒夜为战士们露天演出。各个文工团的团员们在紧张演出的间隙，还轮流为战士们缝被子、补衣服。
    各地的慰问团都举行了慰问大会、报告会、座谈会，向官兵们转达了全国人民的关怀和敬意，介绍了祖国建设事业的成就，还分组深入到阵地、哨站、舰艇等处同战士们亲切交谈。慰问团并且把大批慰问信和慰问品分别送给部队官兵。上海市学生代表团为大陈岛驻军建立了一个命名为“友谊之家”的俱乐部，里面有这个代表团带来的大批书籍、画册和体育文娱器材，其中有一本手抄的诗集是华东师范大学四年级一班同学自己的创作。
    战士们怀着兴奋的心情接受了亲人们的慰问，他们向亲人们汇报了自己在战斗、执勤和训练中的成绩，还用他们自己养的猪、种的菜来招待亲人们。海防线上的海岸炮兵、高射炮兵和雷达兵为慰问团表演了武器操作技术，空军驾驶员们作了喷气式飞机特技表演，边防战士饲养的军犬也作了表演。各部队的战士演出队为慰问团演出了自己创作的反映战斗生活的文艺节目。
    各地慰问团离开部队的时候，都收到大批信件。战士们在信上表示：一定坚决保卫祖国的社会主义建设，保卫全国人民的幸福生活，来答谢亲人们的慰问！
