Fujian Prepares to Pick and Produce Spring Tea

　　(Our report) Since the start of spring, tea farmers in the tea-producing areas of Fujian Province, which is rich in tea, have been stepping up preparations for picking and producing spring tea.

　　In Fu'an, Fuding, Xiapu, Shouning, and other counties that produce Fujian's famous "Minhong" tea, as well as Anxi County, the home of the internationally renowned "Tieguanyin" tea, agricultural cooperative members, both men and women, have recently been working in groups in the tea gardens, weeding, filling soil, applying fertilizer, and cultivating seedlings. By March 15, Fujian Province had issued 1 million yuan in advance payments for tea purchases.

　　Local purchasing departments, in order to support tea farmers' production, have launched advance purchase programs for tea and issued advance deposits. Many agricultural cooperatives have actively purchased tea-making tools and fertilizers after receiving the advance payments. Handicraft production cooperatives in Ningde, Xiapu, Fu'an, and other counties are also busy rushing to produce tea-making tools such as rolling machines, fixing machines, and drying baskets for the tea farmers.

　  福建准备采制春茶
    本报讯  盛产茶叶的福建省，入春以来，各产茶区的茶农们正在加紧准备采制春茶。
    福建省著名的“闽红”茶叶产地福安、福鼎、霞浦、寿宁等县以及闻名海外的“铁观音”茶叶产地安溪县的农业社的男女社员们，最近都成群结队地在茶园里进行除草，填土，施肥，育苗等工作。到3月15日止福建省已发放茶叶预购款达百万元。
    当地采购部门，为了支援茶农生产，已开展了茶叶预购工作，发放了茶叶预购定金。许多农业社领到茶叶预购款后都积极添购了制茶工具和肥料。宁德、霞浦、福安等县的手工业生产合作社，也正忙着为茶农们赶制揉捻机、杀青机、焙笼等制茶工具。  （林琪华）
