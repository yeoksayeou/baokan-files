After Going to the Grassroots Level
By Our Correspondent Gu Weijin

One day in the winter of last year, I went from the Huangpi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to Huancheng Township to find Li Ruihuan, but I didn't expect him to be out.

I was looking for Li Ruihuan to understand the following: He was originally a secretary in the County Committee's Rural Work Department. Later, in order to strengthen the leadership at the grassroots level, the County Committee transferred him to Huancheng Township to serve as the first secretary of the Party General Branch. I heard that when he first arrived in Huancheng Township, his relationship with the General Branch committee members was not good, and his work was very passive; after that, he united the General Branch committee members around him, and his work achieved great success. — What exactly was going on?

That evening, Li Ruihuan heard that I had gone to Huancheng Township to find him, so he automatically came to my residence. He was about thirty years old, of medium height, with a pleasant smile on his slightly dark face. When he learned that I wanted to understand his work in Huancheng Township, he sat close to the stove, lit a cigarette, and began to speak slowly.

Li Ruihuan arrived in Huancheng Township in May last year. He knew that this township was the County Committee's key work area, with a strong cadre force, and estimated that the work would not be too difficult. However, he did not expect that as soon as the work started, difficulties were lurking around. — Chen Dingsong, the second secretary of the General Branch (who was originally the first secretary), and Deputy Secretaries Huang Yingjie, Yang Mingshou, and others did not welcome his arrival. These people discussed together:

	"Why did the higher-ups send someone here for no reason?"

	"Hum! We can't do anything. The higher-ups don't trust us."

	"Okay, let those who have ideas do it!"

They began to show a negative attitude towards work.

Li Ruihuan lacked grassroots work experience and did not know what was going on. He only thought that since everyone was not enthusiastic about their work, he should do more himself; if he did well, he would motivate everyone. So, no matter what work was assigned or what instructions were conveyed, he did it himself; regardless of large or small meetings, he presided over them himself and spoke endlessly…. As a result, the General Branch committee members had even greater opinions.

Chen Dingsong said: "I can't get involved in anything. How can this work continue?"

Chen Qihua said: "He's the only one who gets to show his face. In the eyes of the masses, there is only one secretary, not me, the township head. I can't even convene meetings. What's the point of being the township head?"

They were discouraged, negative, lost confidence in their work, and dared not make decisions on anything, big or small, piling everything on Li Ruihuan.

Li Ruihuan, on the other hand, was afraid of not being able to complete the task, so he took on many things. Gradually, he was overwhelmed. He was very depressed and had dark circles around his eyes every morning. He lost weight.

One day, Zhang, the director of the County Committee's Rural Work Department, came to Huancheng Township and saw Li Ruihuan in this state. He quickly asked how he was feeling. Li Ruihuan said: "There's nothing wrong with my health, it's just that the work is making me worry!" After a pause, he added: "Now that spring plowing and large-scale production are coming, I have to grasp the issue of labor organization, the issue of quota management, and the issue of rice transplanting. But they have piled the issuance of wheat advance purchase funds, the issuance of spring plowing loans, social relief, military veteran resettlement, conscription work, etc., on my head. How can I lead production?" Director Zhang said: "Why are these tasks piled on your head?" "They are not proactive, what can I do?" "Why are they not proactive?" "They..." Li Ruihuan blinked and couldn't say anything. Director Zhang had already understood the situation eight or nine tenths in advance, so he spoke to him kindly about individual responsibility, how it affects unity, and affects work. Finally, he raised his voice and said: "Be humble in everything, discuss and study with everyone more; pay attention to helping everyone, and let them show their faces more. This is the only way to achieve unity, give play to the role of the branch, and do a good job." Li Ruihuan scratched his head and stared straight at Director Zhang. Based on his previous experience, Director Zhang knew that he was considering his suggestions.

When it was almost time to harvest the wheat, Li Ruihuan and Chen Dingsong, the second secretary of the General Branch, attended the County Committee's summer harvest pre-distribution meeting. On the way home, the two walked in silence. Li Ruihuan pondered: Who should convey the content of this meeting to the cadres? If I convey it myself…. He suddenly remembered the past meeting situations: Chen Dingsong had set up the meeting place, and he gave a long speech, while Chen Dingsong squatted in a corner, feeling dejected and having no opportunity to speak. Hey, that's not good! He glanced at Chen Dingsong. Chen Dingsong's face was a bit gloomy, as if he anticipated having to taste the same flavor of the past meetings again. He moved closer to Chen Dingsong and said kindly: "You convey the content of this meeting." "Me? That won't work, I have no culture, no policy level…" "Don't be so modest, we can discuss it together." So he and Chen Dingsong discussed how to convey the spirit of the meeting and the situation in the township. Chen Dingsong recorded everything, and the next day he conveyed it at the cadre meeting. Li Ruihuan found that Chen Dingsong spoke very well, and only a few places were wrong, which could be corrected during the discussion.

Since that incident, Li Ruihuan found that Chen Dingsong was closer to him, and some of the General Branch committee members spoke to him more.

Li Ruihuan was naturally happy. This day, he was considering continuing to improve his working methods when he suddenly heard that some of the seedlings in the Qunguang Cooperative had not turned green after being planted for ten days, some of the rice paddies had grown moss, and 90 mu of fields had been flooded too deeply, damaging the seedlings. He pondered for a while and went to the Qunguang Cooperative to discuss the matter with Chen Changjiu, the director of the cooperative, and Yu Zhongqing, the branch secretary (both of whom were General Branch committee members). It turned out that the cooperative cadres were only busy with wheat threshing and neglected field management. He and they researched ways to save the seedlings, such as draining the water, drying the fields, and spraying pesticide powder. They were very happy. Li Ruihuan thought for a moment and then convened a meeting of the General Branch committee, asking Chen Changjiu and Yu Zhongqing to report on the whole process of the seedling problem at the meeting. Everyone was shocked after hearing it. Chen Dingsong said: "I'm afraid other cooperatives also have the situation of being busy with wheat threshing and neglecting field management." Yang Mingshou said: "We should conduct an inspection throughout the township." Peng Zhilong said: "Carrying out a visit and comparison is a good way to inspect." Based on everyone's opinions, Li Ruihuan launched a visit and comparison campaign throughout the township. As a result, it was found that 21% of the 6,440 mu of medium rice in the township had seedlings that were not growing well. They then rescued the seedlings by referring to the methods of the Qunguang Cooperative.

All the General Branch committee members were very satisfied with this work and said: "Secretary Li has really changed! It's great to work like this!" They all became close to Li Ruihuan. After researching with them, Li Ruihuan established a system of collective leadership with individual responsibility.

The work of the General Branch committee members became proactive. When the rice was heading, Chen Dingsong found that 14 mu of fields in the Qunfa Cooperative were without water, and the rice was about to dry out. The pond of Qunli Cooperative had water. He made his own decision, found the directors of the two cooperatives to discuss borrowing water, and solved the water shortage problem of Qunfa Cooperative. Chen Qihua (the township head) did not wait for Li Ruihuan to participate before holding a meeting as he had done before. He greeted Li Ruihuan in advance and convened it himself.

Li Ruihuan felt that the work was going relatively well, but there were still many difficulties. Autumn crops were about to be sown. In order to save investment, Li Ruihuan planned to use natural fertilizers for the township's more than 6,000 mu of autumn crops, but after holding two meetings of the General Branch committee, everyone could not come up with a good solution.

Li Ruihuan initially complained about everyone, but after thinking about it, he realized that he had not come up with a concrete solution himself. Thinking of this, he decided to delve into one spot, make achievements in accumulating fertilizer, and promote the accumulation of fertilizer among everyone.

Li Ruihuan went to the Qun'ai Cooperative. At the meeting of Party members, Youth League members and activists, he praised the second team for finding a trick to solve the problem of transplanting fertilizer this spring, raising everyone's confidence in accumulating fertilizer, and encouraging everyone to use their brains to find fertilizer sources. Party member Xiao Guobing said: "Good fertilizer is available, but it is not easy to obtain." Li Ruihuan said: "What good fertilizer?" Xiao Guobing said: "The grass growing on the high ridge of the field! I'm just afraid that if it is cut off, it won't grow into firewood, and the masses are unwilling." Others also said: It is difficult to mobilize the masses to do this. Li Ruihuan thought for a moment, found out that there were 270 field ridges in the whole cooperative, and the grass on an average of two field ridges could fertilize one mu of field. He said: "If all the grass on these field ridges is cut, can't 135 mu of field be fertilized?" Everyone did not speak. Li Ruihuan asked again how much money would be needed to buy commercial fertilizer for these 135 mu of field? Everyone calculated that it would cost 578 yuan. Li Ruihuan asked again how much would the grass on these field ridges be worth if it all grew into firewood? Everyone calculated that it was worth 68 yuan. Li Ruihuan said: "Comparing the two, which is more cost-effective? Isn't it obvious?" A noisy voice resounded in the room: "We are talking about reducing costs and increasing income. Where should we find it? It turns out we should find it in these places!" "Yes, if we calculate this detailed account for the masses, how can the masses be unwilling to cut the grass on the field ridges?" Then everyone found fertilizer sources such as water chestnut seedlings and black mud ponds.... The fertilizer problem for the cooperative's more than 400 mu of fields was solved.

At the General Branch committee meeting, Li Ruihuan gave a detailed introduction to the experience of Qun'ai Cooperative in accumulating fertilizer. Everyone listened with full confidence and said: "Since Qun'ai Cooperative can find fertilizer sources, other cooperatives can definitely find them too." They took the experience of Qun'ai Cooperative in accumulating fertilizer to various cooperatives for discussion, and the members put forward many ways to accumulate fertilizer. In a few days, the fertilizer problem for thousands of mu of autumn crops in the township was solved.

When the General Branch committee summed up the experience of this fertilizer accumulation campaign, everyone unanimously felt that Li Ruihuan's working method of delving into one point to promote the overall situation was very good. After that, they adopted this working method to promote new technologies, fight drought, eliminate pests, etc., and promoted the work.

In 1956, the township's grain production increased by 32% compared with the bumper harvest year of 1953. In the days of bumper harvest, the relationship between the General Branch committee members and Li Ruihuan became closer. They often talked to each other. One day, Chen Dingsong, the second secretary, Yang Mingshou, the deputy secretary, Chen Qihua, a member of the General Branch committee, and others talked to Li Ruihuan about their initial feeling of not welcoming his arrival, and everyone laughed.

　　到基层以后
　　本报记者　古维进
    去年冬季有一天，我从中共黄陂县委会到环城乡找李瑞桓，没想到他刚好出去了。
    我找李瑞桓是想了解这样一件事情：他原来是在县委农村工作部当秘书的，后来县委为了加强基层领导力量，把他调到环城乡担任党总支第一书记。听说他初到环城乡的时候，和总支委员的关系搞得不好，工作非常被动；之后，他把总支委员团结在自己的周围，工作取得很大的成绩。——这一切，究竟是怎么一回事呢？
    当天晚上，李瑞桓听说我到环城乡找过他，就自动跑到我的住处来了。他大约三十岁，中等个子，微黑的脸上流露着愉快的笑容。当他知道我要了解他在环城乡工作的情况时，就坐近炉火旁边，点着纸烟，慢条斯理地说起来。
    李瑞桓是去年5月间到环城乡的。他知道这个乡是县委的工作重点，干部力量不弱，估计工作不会有多大困难的。但是，他没有想到工作刚开始，困难就在周围隐伏着。——总支第二书记陈定松（原来是第一书记）和副书记黄英杰、杨明寿等，对于他的到来，是不大欢迎的。这些人在一块议论着：
      “好端端的为什么上级派一个人来呢？”
      “哼！我们没办法，上级不信任了。”
    “好吧，让有办法的人去干吧！”
    他们开始对工作表示消极。
    李瑞桓缺乏基层工作经验，不知道这是怎么一回事，只想到大家既然工作不带劲，自己就多干一些吧；干好了，就把大家带动起来了。于是不论布置什么工作、传达什么指示，他都亲自动手；不管大会小会，他都亲自主持，滔滔地说不完……。这一来，总支委员的意见更大啦。
    陈定松说：“什么都插不上手，这工作怎么干下去呢？”
    陈启华说：“尽是他出头露面，群众的眼中就只有一个书记，没有我这个乡长，我会议都召集不起来了，我这个乡长干得还有什么意思。”
    他们泄气、消极，失掉工作信心，不管大小事情都不敢作主，堆到李瑞桓的头上了。
    李瑞桓呢，害怕不能完成任务，把许多事情都包揽起来。渐渐地，压得喘不过气来了。他非常苦闷，每天早上起来，眼睛都围着大黑圈。他消瘦了。
    这天，县委农村工作部长张同志来到环城乡，看见李瑞桓这个样子，忙问他的身体怎样。李瑞桓说：“身体倒没有什么，就是工作把人愁得不行呀！”顿了顿，又说：“如今春耕大生产就要到来，我要抓劳力组织问题、定额管理问题、栽秧问题。可是，他们把发小麦预购款、发春耕贷款、社会救济、军人转业、兵役工作等等都堆到我的头上，叫我怎么去领导生产呢？”张同志说：“为什么要把这些工作堆到你的头上呢？”“他们不主动，有什么办法。”“为什么他们不主动？”“他们……”李瑞桓眨眨眼睛，说不上来了。张同志事前已经把情况了解八、九分，便亲切地跟他谈到个人包办，怎样影响团结，影响工作。末了，他提高嗓音说：“凡事要虚心，多和大家商量研究；注意帮助大家，多让他们出头露面。这样才能搞好团结，发挥支部的作用，做好工作。”李瑞桓用手搔着头发，直盯盯地瞧着张同志。根据以往相处的经验，张同志知道他在考虑自己的意见了。
    快到收麦的时候，李瑞桓和总支第二书记陈定松参加了县委会的夏收预分会议，在回家的路上，两个人默默地走着。李瑞桓心里琢磨起来：这次会议内容，由谁向干部传达呢？要是自己传达……。他忽然想起过去的会议情形：陈定松把会场布置好了，自己滔滔地说一顿，陈定松灰溜溜地蹲在一个角落，没有说话的机会。嗨，这样多不好啊！他望陈定松一眼，陈定松的脸孔有点沉闷，仿佛预感到又要尝受过去那种会议的滋味。他紧靠陈定松，亲切地说：“这次会议的东西，你来传达吧。”“我？可不成呀，没文化，没政策水平……”“不必客气，我们商量着办。”于是他和陈定松商量怎样根据会议的精神和乡里的情况，进行传达。陈定松一一记录下来，第二天就在干部会上传达。李瑞桓发现陈定松说得很好，只有个别地方说错，这在讨论时可以修正。
    从这件事情以后，李瑞桓发现陈定松和他比较接近了，有的总支委员和他说话也多一些了。
    李瑞桓自然高兴。这天，他正在考虑继续改进工作方法，忽然听说群光社的秧苗有的栽了十天不转青，有的秧田长了青苔，有九十亩田灌水太深把秧苗淹坏。他沉吟了一会，忙到群光社和社主任陈长久、分支书记余仲清（都是总支委员）研究是怎么回事。原来是社干部光顾打麦，忽视田间管理。他便和他们研究出放浅水、晒田、撒药粉等办法把种苗拯救过来，他们非常高兴。李瑞桓想了一想，又召开总支委员会会议，让陈长久和余仲清把这次秧苗发生问题的前前后后在会上报告，大家听罢，吃了一惊。陈定松说：“光顾打麦，忽视田间管理的情况，恐怕旁的社也有。”杨明寿说：“应该在全乡作一次检查。”彭志龙说：“开展参观评比是检查的好办法。”李瑞桓根据大家的意见，在全乡开展了参观评比运动。结果，发现全乡六千四百四十亩中稻，有21％的秧苗长得不好。便参照群光社的办法把秧苗拯救过来。
    全体总支委员对这一次的工作非常满意，都说：“李书记真是变了！像这样干工作才痛快呢！”他们都和李瑞桓亲近起来。李瑞桓和他们研究后，建立起集体领导分工负责的制度。
    总支委员们的工作都主动起来了。当稻谷出穗的时候，陈定松发现群发社有十四亩田没有水，稻谷就要干坏，而群力社的塘里有水，便自己拿出主意，找到两个社的主任商量借水，解决了群发社的缺水问题。陈启华（乡长）开个什么会议，也不像以前那样等到李瑞桓参加才进行，事先和李瑞桓打个招呼，自己就召开了。
    李瑞桓觉得工作比较得手了，但是困难还是很多的。复秋作物将要下种，为了节约投资，李瑞桓计划将全乡六千多亩复秋作物采用自然肥料，但是开了两次总支委员会，大家都没有想出好办法。
    李瑞桓开始时埋怨大家，可是想了一想，自己不是也没有拿出具体办法吗？想到这里，他决定深入一个点，做出积肥的成绩，推动大家开展积肥运动。
    李瑞桓到了群爱社，在党团员积极分子会议上，他表扬了二队今春找窍门解决栽秧肥的事情，提高大家积肥的信心，让大家都开动脑筋找肥源。党员萧国炳说：“好肥料倒有，就是不大好搞。”李瑞桓说：“什么好肥料？”萧国炳说：“田埂子高头长的草！就怕割掉长不成柴，群众不愿意。”旁的人也说：这件事情，很难发动群众去搞。李瑞桓想了一想，问明全社有二百七十条田埂，平均两条田埂的草可以肥一亩田，就说：“把这些田埂的草都割起来，不是可以肥一百三十五亩田吗？”大家没有说话。李瑞桓又问这一百三十五亩田靠买商品肥料得多少钱？大家算了算，需要五百七十八元。李瑞桓又问这些田埂的草都长成柴，值多少钱？大家算了算，值六十八元。李瑞桓说：“两下一对比，哪个合算，不是明摆着吗？”屋子里响起了一阵嘈杂的声音：“我们说降低成本，增加收入，从哪里去找，原来就从这些地方去找！”“是呀，要是把这个细账给群众一算，群众那还有不乐意割田埂草的？”接着大家又找出菱角苗、黑泥塘等肥源。……全社四百多亩田的肥料问题得到解决了。
    在总支委员会上，李瑞桓把群爱社的积肥经验作了详细的介绍。大家听了满有信心地说：“既然群爱社能找到肥源，其他的社也一定可以找到。”他们把群爱社的积肥经验带到各社展开讨论，社员提出许多积肥的办法。不几天，全乡数千亩复秋作物的肥料问题都解决了。
    总支委员会总结这次积肥运动的经验的时候，大家一致感到李瑞桓的这种深入一点推动全面的工作方法很好。之后，他们推广新技术，抗旱、除虫等都采取了这种工作方法，把工作推动起来了。
    1956年这个乡的粮食比丰收的1953年增产32％。在丰收的日子里，总支委员们和李瑞桓的关系更加密切。他们经常在一块谈心。这天，第二书记陈定松、副书记杨明寿、总支委员陈启华等和李瑞桓谈到他们当初对他到来的那种不欢迎的心情，大家都笑起来了。
