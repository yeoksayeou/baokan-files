    On Brevity and Length in Writing
    Song Yunbin
      On March 8th, the People's Daily published an article by Comrade Gao Yan entitled "Economy of Words," advocating that writing should adhere to the principle of "economy," striving for conciseness and avoiding verbosity. His opinion is good; it is a good remedy for those comrades who like to write long articles that are empty in content and verbose in wording.
    However, the key to brevity and length in writing lies in appropriateness; what should be concise should be concise, and what should not be concise should not be concise. If what should not be concise is also made concise, it will only reduce the power and vitality of the article, and may even give the reader a vague impression. Take the story of Ouyang Xiu mentioned in Comrade Gao Yan's article: [Note] Ouyang Xiu and a friend saw a runaway horse trampling a dog to death on the road, and asked his friend how to write it down. His friend thought for a while and replied, "There was a dog lying on the thoroughfare, trampled to death by a runaway horse." Ouyang Xiu felt that this sentence was a bit cumbersome, and only six words would suffice: "Runaway horse kills dog on road." He also ridiculed his friend, saying, "If you were to write history, ten thousand volumes would not be enough." Comrade Gao Yan agreed with Ouyang Xiu's writing, saying that "he recorded this event with almost half the words saved compared to his colleague." In fact, the sentence drafted by Ouyang Xiu is not superior to the one drafted by his friend. His friend said that a dog lying on the road was trampled to death by a runaway horse, which is concise and clear, and people can understand it at a glance. Ouyang Xiu said that the horse killed the dog, which is not only different from the main point of his friend, but also gives people a vague impression because it is too brief and not comprehensive: why did the "runaway horse" "kill the dog on the road"? How did it "kill the dog on the road," by trampling or kicking?
    Ouyang Xiu's ridicule of his friend also has a background. Originally, Ouyang Xiu and Song Qi co-edited the "New Book of Tang." What they were most proud of was that the "New Book of Tang" recorded more events than the "Old Book of Tang," but the number of words was less than the "Old Book of Tang," which is what Zeng Gongliang said in his "Presentation of the New Book of Tang": "Its events are more than before, and its text is more economical than before." He ridiculed his friend—"If you were to write history, ten thousand volumes would not be enough," which was very self-satisfied, as if saying, only I, Ouyang Xiu, know how to be concise in writing. But in fact, the shortcoming of the "New Book of Tang" is precisely that the text is too concise, making the characters and stories stiff, neither vivid nor emotional. Wang Ruoxu's "Hunan Yilao Collection" (Volume 22) quoted Liu Qizhi's criticism of the "New Book of Tang," saying that the "New Book of Tang" was too focused on simplifying sentences, and the narration was often not clear enough. It also said that Sima Qian and Ban Gu used five hundred words to write the story of Sima Xiangru and Zhuo Wenjun's love, and it didn't feel cumbersome to read. If Song Qi (and Ouyang Xiu) were to write it, they would definitely compress it into one sentence, seven big characters: "Once secretly stole Zhuo's to escape." This is certainly satirical, and it's also a bit of an exaggeration; but the fact is that Ouyang Xiu and Song Qi did not have a deep enough understanding of the principles of brevity and length in writing.
      Of course, no one would advocate writing lengthy and rambling articles. Great writers have always paid attention to refining sentences. Zhang Taiyan, who was most famous for writing classical Chinese and brought it to a glorious end, believed that writing should be done "without superfluous words," deleting as many floating words and general phrases as possible. Lu Xun also taught us to "read the article at least twice after finishing it, and strive to delete dispensable words, sentences, and paragraphs without regret." However, Zhang Taiyan had such a large passage in his famous "Memorial Book for the 240th Anniversary of the Fall of Central China": "I wish my Yunnan people would not forget Li Dingguo; I wish my Fujian people would not forget Zheng Chenggong; I wish my Yue people would not forget Zhang Huangyan; I wish my Guangxi people would not forget Qu Shisi; I wish my Chu people would not forget He Tengjiao; I wish my Liaoning people would not forget Li Chengliang." He listed the names of six national heroes from the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, asking everyone not to forget them, and said it so specifically: asking the people of Yunnan not to forget Li Dingguo, the people of Fujian not to forget Zheng Chenggong... How could such emotional language not move people's hearts? Therefore, his article played a great role in propaganda and mobilization at that time (before the Xinhai Revolution). If, in order to save words, such a large passage were simplified to "I wish my compatriots would not forget the martyrs," what power would it have, and what propaganda and mobilization role could it play? The first sentence of Lu Xun's "Autumn Night" is: "In my backyard, you can see two trees outside the wall, one is a jujube tree, and the other is also a jujube tree." Why didn't he simplify it to "In my backyard, you can see two jujube trees outside the wall"? Did he teach people to refine sentences while wasting ink himself? No. Because it is more vivid to write it this way, and it shows his unique style. Such sentences cannot be simplified. There are many such examples, and here is another one: In the "Book of Rites" (Chapter on Sacrificial Meanings), there is a passage spoken by Zeng Zi: "Filial piety...extend it to the East Sea and it will be accurate, extend it to the West Sea and it will be accurate, extend it to the South Sea and it will be accurate, extend it to the North Sea and it will be accurate." If it were simplified to "Filial piety, extend it to the four seas and it will be accurate," the "words" would be "saved by more than half," and the meaning would not change much, but the tone would be very different, much weaker than the original.
    The so-called economy of words, to put it more concretely, means that when writing, the principle of economy should also be followed in the use of language. In the economic sense, the so-called economy is not simply simplification, rigidly sticking to the idea of using as little financial and material resources as possible, but to use them in a planned way, using them where they should be used, even if used a lot, it is not a waste, and absolutely not using them where they should not be used, even if used a little, it is a waste. Applying this principle to writing, that is, brevity and length should be appropriate, say as much as possible where it should be said, and don't mind saying ten or eight sentences, and just gloss over where it should be said less, and it's a waste to say even half a sentence where it shouldn't be said. If we understand the economy of words as trying to compress as much as possible and write "shorter, shorter" in any case, then we are thinking too simply. To put it bluntly: we don't understand the principle of economy at all.
　　[Note] Lu Xun's article also mentioned that story ("Writing," see old edition of "Complete Works of Lu Xun," Volume 5, page 585), which is different from Comrade Gao Yan's saying, and it is not about Ouyang Xiu's affairs. Because Lu Xun quoted Shen Kuo's "Dream Pool Essays," while Comrade Gao Yan is based on the "Conghua of the Eight Great Masters of Tang and Song." It may be different versions of the same event.

    文章繁简
    宋云彬
      3月8日人民日报登了高炎同志写的一篇文章，题目叫“文字的‘节约’”，主张写文章要遵守“节约”原则，尽量做到简练，避免冗长。他的意见是好的；对于那些喜欢写内容空洞、词句噜囌的长文章的同志们倒是一服良药。
    不过文章繁简，贵在得当，该简的才简，不该简的就不简。不该简的也简了，那只会使文章减少力量，缺乏生气，甚至于会给读者一种模糊的印象。就拿高炎同志文章里提到的欧阳修那个故事来说吧：〔注〕欧阳修同朋友在大路上看见一匹奔马踩死了一只狗，就问他的朋友，如果把这件事用文字记下来，该怎么写。他的朋友想一想，回答说：“有犬卧通衢，逸马蹄而死之。”欧阳修觉得这样的造句未免累赘，只要用六个字就成：“逸马杀犬于道。”他还讥笑他的朋友，说：“使子修史，万卷未已也。”高炎同志赞成欧阳修的写法，说“他记述这件事，几乎比他的同事节省一半的字”。其实欧阳修拟的那一句并不比他的朋友拟的高明。他的朋友是说躲在大路上的一只狗给一匹逸马踩死了，言简意赅，人家一看就明白。欧阳修说的是马杀死了犬，不但跟他的朋友说的主旨不一样，而且因为简略得过分了，言简而意不赅，反给了人家一种模糊的印象：究竟“逸马”为什么“杀犬于道”？怎么样“杀犬于道”，踩死的还是踢死的？
    欧阳修讥笑他的朋友的话也是有来历的。原来欧阳修跟宋祁同修“新唐书”，他们最为得意的是“新唐书”记的事情比“旧唐书”多，而字数反比“旧唐书”少，就是曾公亮“进新唐书表”里说的“其事则增于前，其文则省于旧”。他讥笑他的朋友——“使子修史，万卷未已也”，大有自鸣不凡之概，仿佛说，只有我欧阳修才懂得怎么样简练文句。可是事实上“新唐书”的缺点恰恰就在于文字太简约，把人物和故事都给写得死板板地，既不生动，也缺乏感情。王若虚的“滹南遗老集”（卷二十二）里引刘器之批评“新唐书”的话，说“新唐书”一味精简文句，叙事多不够明畅。又说，司马迁、班固用了五百个字来写司马相如和卓文君相恋的故事，读起来不觉其繁，假使叫宋祁（和欧阳修）来写，一定会压缩成一句话、七个大字：“少尝窃卓氏以逃。”这话固然是讽刺，而且也说得过分些；但是欧阳修、宋祁他们对于文章繁简的道理体会不够深，却是事实。
      当然不会有人提倡写冗长而拖沓的文章。从来大作家都讲究精练字句。写文言文最有名、而且给文言文作了光荣的结束的章太炎，认为写文章应该做到“辞无枝叶”，把浮辞泛语尽量删去。鲁迅也教我们文章“写完后至少看两遍，竭力将可有可无的字、句、段删去，毫不可惜”。然而章太炎在他的那篇有名的“中夏亡国二百四十年纪念会书”里有这么一大段话：“愿吾滇人，无忘李定国；愿吾闽人，无忘郑成功；愿吾越人，无忘张煌言；愿吾桂人，无忘瞿式耜；愿吾楚人，无忘何腾蛟；愿吾辽人，无忘李成梁。”他列举六个明末清初的民族英雄的姓名，要求大家不要忘记他们，而且说得那么具体：要求云南人不要忘记李定国，福建人不要忘记郑成功……这样的充满感情的语言，怎能不打动人的心？所以他那篇文章在当时（辛亥革命前）起了极大的宣传和鼓动作用。如果为了节约文字，把这么一大段话精简为“愿吾同胞，无忘先烈”，那还有什么力量，还能起什么宣传和鼓动作用呢？鲁迅写的那篇“秋夜”，第一句话是：“在我的后园，可以看见墙外有两株树，一株是枣树，还有一株也是枣树。”他为什么不把它精简为“在我的后园，可以看见墙外有两株枣树”呢？难道他教人家精练字句而自己偏来浪费笔墨吗？不是的。因为这样写才生动，才显出他的独特的风格。这样的文句是精简不得的。这种例子很多，不妨再举一个：“礼记”（祭义篇）里有曾子说的一段话：“夫孝……推而放诸东海而准，推而放诸西海而准，推而放诸南海而准，推而放诸北海而准。”如果把它精简成“夫孝，推诸四海而皆准”，“字”不止“节省一半”，意思也还没有什么改变，然而语气大不同了，比原来的要软弱无力得多了。
    所谓文字的节约，说得具体一点，就是写文章的时候，在语言的使用上也应该遵守节约的原则。在经济的意义上讲，所谓节约，并不是一味精简，死扣住财力物力尽量少用的意思，而是要有计划地用，该用的地方用，那怕用得多也不算浪费，不该用的地方绝对不用，那怕用一点点也是浪费。这个原则应用到写文章上面去，那就是繁简得当，该多说几句的地方尽量说，十句八句也不嫌其多，该少说的地方就一笔带过，不该说的地方那怕说上半句也是浪费。如果把文字的节约了解为在任何情况下都要尽量压缩，尽量写得“短些，再短些”，那未免想得太简单了。说得不客气一点：全没懂得节约的道理。
　　〔注〕鲁迅的文章里也提到过那个故事（“做文章”，见旧版“鲁迅全集”第五卷五八五页），跟高炎同志的说法不同，也并不是欧阳修的事情。因为鲁迅是引沈括“梦溪笔谈”的，而高炎同志是根据“唐宋八家丛话”的。可能是一件事情的传闻异词。
