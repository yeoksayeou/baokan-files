　　Work Report of the CPPCC Jiangxi Provincial Committee
　　Speech by Fu Xiaoxian

    I fully endorse all the reports of the conference and will resolutely implement them in practical actions. Now, I would like to express some opinions on the work of the CPPCC Jiangxi Provincial Committee.

    The work of the CPPCC Jiangxi Provincial Committee in 1956 was conducted under the new situation of the great leap forward in the socialist cause of the great motherland, and continued to be based on the seven principles of the General Program of the Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Chairman Mao's instructions on the five tasks of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Thanks to the correct guidance of the CPPCC National Committee and the strong support of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the various work tasks of 1956 were successfully completed. In completing these tasks, certain achievements were made, but there were also some shortcomings.

　　Developing Political Consultation Work

    Over the past year, as the united front has become more consolidated and expanded, political consultation work has also been strengthened. In 1956, we conducted consultations and discussions on major political tasks and important policies and laws of the country at various times, as well as important issues in the united front, such as the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), the Handling of War Criminals, the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, the Issue of Intellectuals, and Increasing Production and Practicing Economy, through plenary meetings of all members, standing committees, symposiums with people from all walks of life, and professional symposiums. In addition, the provincial and municipal CPPCC organizations also conducted consultations and discussions on major local issues and specific measures, such as the Jiangxi Province's 1956 National Economic Plan (Draft), the plan for the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, urban construction, and the supply of goods for the Spring Festival. Through various forms of consultation and discussion, the ideological understanding of people from all walks of life has been improved to varying degrees, assisting the government in promoting various tasks and playing a positive role of the CPPCC. However, we also had shortcomings in our consultation work. The main one is that sometimes there were shortcomings of formalism in the consultation of certain issues, manifested in the fact that some people, due to insufficient understanding or certain concerns, could not speak freely during the consultation; some relevant departments did not provide specific information on the issues proposed for consultation, or did not give the members sufficient time for preparation and investigation before the consultation, making it difficult for some members to put forward opinions on the spot. Therefore, I believe that in the future, in addition to further emphasizing and utilizing the CPPCC organization, all departments should, as far as possible, bring all major local measures to the CPPCC for consultation. It is also necessary to give the members sufficient preparation time before the consultation, and the relevant departments should specifically introduce the situation to the members on the issues proposed for consultation, and the opinions put forward in the consultation must be carefully handled. Everything should be implemented and everything should be accounted for, so as to further exert the due role of the CPPCC in socialist construction and socialist transformation.

　　Organizing Political Theory Learning

    With the rapid development of socialist construction and socialist transformation, people from all walks of life are increasingly feeling the urgent need to study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works. On the original basis, we continued to organize 33 people, including the heads of provincial-level democratic parties and democratic people above the level of director-general working in provincial-level organs and people's organizations, to form a philosophy self-study group to study philosophy, and organized 111 people from democratic party organs, the provincial federation of industry and commerce, the provincial museum of culture and history, and counselors from the counselors' office to study political economics and the history of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union, respectively. A total of 144 people participated in regular theoretical study. In addition to theoretical study, we also regularly organized and helped democratic people from all walks of life to study current affairs policies, such as the People's Daily article "On the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship." Similarly, the CPPCC organizations in various cities and counties also organized local democratic people to study political theory and current affairs policies, which improved the political theory and current affairs policy level of people from all walks of life. At the same time, in order to more widely meet the requirements of people from all walks of life for political and theoretical study, and in order to better assist people from all walks of life in ideological transformation, we, in accordance with the decision of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on organizing democratic people and industrialists and businessmen from all walks of life to conduct political study and theoretical study, and in accordance with the teaching principles of voluntariness, freedom, and autonomy, held political schools and political training classes for industrialists and businessmen. Twenty-three cities and counties in the province with CPPCC organizations have successively established political training classes for industrialists and businessmen according to our suggestions, and ten counties without CPPCC organizations have opened political training classes for industrialists and businessmen and established contact with our association. In 1956, the provincial political school had already opened one term, with 174 students, and the political training class for industrialists and businessmen had opened two terms, with 1,074 students. The political training classes for industrialists and businessmen in various cities and counties have all opened two terms, with a total of 4,853 students. Due to the urgent need for learning, people from all walks of life are generally active in learning. Through study, people from all walks of life have improved their political ideology and policy level to varying degrees. For example, after the trainees of the political training class for industry and commerce returned to their original enterprises after graduation, their work enthusiasm was generally very high, and the relationship between public and private cooperation was improved. Many people were elected as advanced workers.

　　Organizing Visits and Inspections

    In addition to helping democratic people from all walks of life conduct self-education and self-transformation through political theory learning, we also strengthened visits and inspections. In 1956, we organized 51 people, including some members of the CPPCC, provincial-level members of various democratic parties, counselors of the provincial counselors' office, and members of the provincial museum of culture and history, to visit the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition in Hankou. At the same time, in accordance with the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on inspection work, we organized people from all walks of life to go to the countryside for inspection twice. Through the inspection, the members not only gained a further understanding of the actual situation of industrial and agricultural production, grain supply, urban construction, transportation, cultural, educational and health, science and technology, and judicial work, but also realistically and conscientiously examined the problems existing in various tasks, and put forward many constructive opinions, which powerfully exerted the supervisory role of the members over the government's work. In order to better help democratic people from all walks of life carry out ideological transformation and meet their learning requirements, we suggest that the National CPPCC relax the conditions for participating in the study of the Socialist Academy and admit more people. If the number of places is limited, please send some of the learning materials of the Socialist Academy to the local CPPCCs for their reference in their studies.

    In 1956, we held irregular science lectures and gave lectures on scientific knowledge to democratic people from all walks of life, which was well received and very rewarding.

　　Conducting Social Liaison Work

    In order to expand and consolidate the people's democratic united front, unite all forces that can be united, and accelerate socialist construction and socialist transformation, we have, according to the specific conditions of our province, carried out social liaison work through various democratic parties and people's organizations. In 1956, our province contacted 614 people from the upper and middle strata of society. Generally speaking, these people are more deeply influenced by old ideas, their viewpoints and positions change more slowly, and their pessimistic and negative emotions are more pronounced. After being contacted, they were organized to study current affairs policies, visit socialist construction undertakings, and hold various cultural and recreational activities. The vast majority of people have improved their thinking to varying degrees. They believe that this is the care of the Communist Party and the People's Government for them, and they expressed unusual excitement and gratitude. Many older people, who previously thought that they had no future, did not even read newspapers, and sat at home waiting to die, are now very enthusiastic about learning and are eager to transform their thinking. They read newspapers every day and are concerned about national affairs. For example, there is an old man in his 70s in Nanchang City. Before participating in the CPPCC study, his son wrote to him asking where he was studying. He was embarrassed to answer. After participating in the CPPCC study, he was very happy and said: "The problem that was difficult to answer for several years has now been solved." He quickly wrote to tell his son that "Dad is studying at the CPPCC." Because their ideological understanding has been improved, many people have actively participated in street literacy work, some have participated in intellectual recruitment, and some have requested to join democratic party organizations. However, some people's ideological consciousness is still quite backward, which is manifested in the fact that some people's enemy-friend boundaries, positions, and viewpoints are relatively vague, and some people even say that the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution was a "long-haired rebellion." Some people feel that they have been "wronged" after being contacted and becoming members, and that they are "heroes without a place to use their talents." These problems show that our contact work with social figures must continue to implement the policy of unity, education, and transformation, and focus on improving them politically and ideologically. Among the social figures contacted, some people asked us to arrange work or provide financial assistance. We have done a lot of work in this area. Some people have been arranged as CPPCC members, members of the Museum of Culture and History, or other jobs. For those who have not yet been arranged, they are encouraged to create employment conditions and gradually arrange them according to the needs and possibilities of the country. Those who are old and weak, have lost their ability to work and have no source of income, or have some meager income that is not enough to live on, or have difficulties such as illness that cannot be solved, are given regular or temporary relief by the government according to the situation. However, in the past, we did not provide care for some elderly people because we believed that their children were employed and should be supported by their children. As a result, because the children themselves had too many children and were overburdened, they were unable to support them, which caused some elderly people to suffer some difficulties in their lives, which often led to family disputes and affected the work emotions of their children. Our opinion is that the government should also try to provide care for individual CPPCC members without concurrent positions and elderly people in society who are really in difficulty, so as to reduce their difficulties.

    In order to give full play to the spirit of consultation, more widely contact the masses and solicit their opinions and requirements, the provincial and municipal CPPCCs have set up working groups such as politics and law, industry and commerce, religion, and culture and education according to different situations, and absorbed members with similar work natures to participate in consultations and discussions on various related issues. For the opinions put forward by the working groups and the letters and visits from the people, a reception and registration system has been established, and they are promptly sorted out and sent to relevant departments for research and reference. It is required that everything be implemented and everything be accounted for, and the replies and handling of relevant departments are reported to the Standing Committee regularly. In addition, we have also established a bi-weekly symposium, a chairman and vice-chairman office meeting, and a secretary-general office meeting system to strengthen work contacts with various democratic parties and strengthen the leadership and business promotion of our association's work.

    1957 is the last year for our people to complete and overfulfill the first five-year plan. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions at the Supreme State Council and the spirit of the resolutions of this conference, vigorously carry out CPPCC work, and strive to further consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front, mobilize all forces, and serve socialism.

### 政协江西省委员会的工作情况　傅肖先的发言

专栏：

　　政协江西省委员会的工作情况
　　傅肖先的发言
    我对大会各项报告表示完全拥护，并坚决贯彻到实际行动中去。现在我就政协江西省委员会的工作发表一些意见。
    政协江西省委员会1956年的工作，是在伟大祖国社会主义事业的飞跃发展的新形势下，继续根据中国人民政治协商会议章程总纲的七项准则和毛主席关于中国人民政治协商会议五项任务的指示精神进行的。由于政协全国委员会的正确指导和中共江西省委的大力支持，胜利地完成了1956年的各项工作任务。在完成各项工作任务中，取得了一定的成绩，但也存在着一些缺点。
　　开展政治协商工作
    一年来由于统一战线的更加巩固与扩大，政治协商工作也随之加强了。1956年我们通过全体委员会议、常务委员会、各界人士座谈会和专业座谈会等方式，就有关国家各个时期的重大政治任务和各项重要政策、法令以及统一战线中的重要问题，如全国农业发展纲要（草案）、关于处理战犯问题、汉语拼音方案、知识分子问题、增产节约等问题进行了协商和讨论。此外，省、市政协组织，对当地的重大问题和具体措施，如江西省1956年度国民经济计划（草案）、对资本主义工商业改造的部署、城市建设、春节物资供应等问题也进行了协商和讨论。通过各种不同形式的协商和讨论，使各界人士的思想认识都有着不同程度的提高，协助政府推动了各项工作，发挥了政协的积极作用。但是我们在协商工作中，也是存在缺点的。主要是有时在某些问题的协商中还存在形式主义的缺点，表现在部分人士在协商时由于认识不够，或者是存有一定的顾虑，还不能做到畅所欲言；某些有关部门对于提出协商的问题介绍情况不够具体，或者在协商前没有给委员们以充分准备和调查研究的时间，使得有些委员在会上很难临时提出意见。因此，我认为今后各部门除了应该进一步重视和运用政协这个组织，凡是当地的各项重大措施，应当尽可能地拿到政协来协商之外，还必须在进行协商以前给委员们以充分的准备时间，对于提出协商的问题，由有关部门向委员们具体介绍情况，对协商中提出的意见，必须认真加以处理。做到事事有着落、件件有交代，这样才能进一步发挥政协在社会主义建设和社会主义改造中的应有作用。
　　组织政治理论学习
    随着社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的飞跃发展，各界人士对马克思、列宁主义和毛主席著作的学习，日益感到迫切的需要。我们在原有基础上继续组织了各民主党派省级负责人以及在省级机关和人民团体工作的厅、局长以上民主人士共三十三人成立了哲学自修组学习哲学，并组织了民主党派机关、省工商联、省文史馆人员以及参事室参事共一百十一人分别学习政治经济学及联共（布）党史，参加经常性理论学习的共计一百四十四人。除理论学习外，还经常组织和帮助各界民主人士学习时事政策，如人民日报“关于无产阶级专政的历史经验”一文的学习等等。各市、县政协也同样的组织了当地的民主人士的政治理论和时事政策的学习，通过理论和时事政策学习，提高了各界人士的政治理论和时事政策水平。同时，为了更广泛地满足各界人士对政治和理论学习的要求，为了更好地协助各界人士进行思想改造，我们根据中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会关于组织各界民主人士和工商业者进行政治学习和理论学习的决定的指示精神，根据自觉、自愿、自由的教学方针，举办了政治学校和工商业者政治讲习班，全省设有政协组织的二十三个市、县，亦已先后根据本会建议设立了工商业者政治讲习班，未设政协组织的县，已有十个县开办了工商业者政治讲习班并与本会建立了联系。1956年省政治学校已开办一期，学员一百七十四人，工商业者政治讲习班开办了二期，学员一千零七十四人，各市、县的工商业者政治讲习班，均已开办二期，学员共四千八百五十三人，由于对学习的要求迫切，各界人士对学习一般是积极的。通过学习都不同程度地提高了各界人士的政治思想和政策水平，如工商业政治讲习班的学员结业回到原企业后，一般工作热情都很高，改善了公私共事关系，不少人当选了先进工作者。
　　组织参观和视察
    除了通过政治理论学习帮助各界民主人士进行自我教育、自我改造以外，还加强了参观和视察工作。1956年我们组织了政协部分委员、各民主党派省级委员、省参事室参事、省文史馆员共五十一人赴汉口参观苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会。同时遵照全国人民代表大会常务委员会和中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会关于视察工作的决定，组织了各界人士两次下乡视察工作。通过视察，委员们不仅对工农业的生产、粮食供应、城市建设、交通运输、文教卫生、科学技术以及司法工作的实际情况有了进一步的了解，而且实事求是地认真检查了各项工作中存在的问题，提出了许多建设性的意见，有力地发挥了委员们对政府工作的监督作用。为了更好的帮助各界民主人士进行思想改造，满足他们的学习要求，我们建议全国政协将参加社会主义学院学习的条件放宽些，吸收更多的人入学，如果名额有限，则请将社会主义学院的学习材料分寄一些给各地政协，以供他们学习中的参考。
    1956年，我们举办了不定期的科学讲座，向各界民主人士进行了科学知识的讲演，反映很好，收获很大。
　　进行社会联系工作
    为了扩大和巩固人民民主统一战线，团结一切可能团结的力量，加速社会主义建设和社会主义改造，我们曾根据我省具体情况，通过各民主党派、人民团体开展社会联系工作。1956年，我省曾联系了社会中上层人士六百一十四人。这些人，一般地说，受旧思想影响较深，观点、立场转变较慢，悲观消极情绪比较浓厚。经过联系以后，组织了他们学习时事政策，参观社会主义建设事业，举行各种文娱活动，绝大多数人思想上都有程度不同的提高，他们认为这是共产党和人民政府对他们的关怀，表示异常兴奋和感谢。许多年龄较大的人，以前认为自己没有前途，报纸也不看，坐在家里等死，现在他们学习情绪都很高，迫切要求思想改造，天天看报纸，关心国家大事。例如，南昌市有一个七十多岁的老年人，参加政协学习前，他的儿子写信问他在那里学习，他不好回答，参加政协学习后，他非常高兴的说：“几年来不好回答的问题，现在解决了”，他很快的就写信告诉他的儿子说“爸爸在政协学习了”。由于他们思想认识有了提高，许多人积极参加了街道扫盲工作，有的参加知识分子应聘，有的要求参加民主党派组织。但是，有些人思想意识仍然相当落后，这表现在有的人敌我界限、立场观点上比较模糊，有的还说太平天国革命是“长毛造反”，有的人联系后做了委员，还觉得是受了“委屈”，“英雄无用武之地”。这些问题说明了我们对社会人士的联系工作，必须继续贯彻团结、教育、改造的方针，着重从政治思想上去提高他们。在联系的社会人士中，有些人要求我们安排工作或给予经济上的补助，我们在这方面曾做了很多工作，有些人已经安排为政协委员、文史馆员或其他工作，对尚未安排的人，则鼓励他们创造就业条件，根据国家的需要和可能，逐步予以安排。对年老体弱、已丧失劳动力毫无经济来源的，或者有些微收入、确实不够生活的，或因患病等困难无法解决的，则由政府根据情况分别予以定期救济或临时救济。但是过去对某些老年人，因为我们认为他有儿女参加工作，应由儿女供养，没有给予生活上的照顾，结果，因为儿女本身小孩过多，负担过重，无力供养，而使某些老年人生活上遭受了一些困难，以致家庭时常发生纠纷，影响了家庭团结和儿女的工作情绪。我们的意见，政府对于个别无兼职的政协委员和生活确实困难的社会老人，今后也应设法给予生活上的照顾，减少他们的困难。
    为了充分发挥协商精神，更广泛的联系群众和征求群众的意见、要求，省市政协曾根据不同情况设有政法、工商、宗教、文教等工作组，吸收工作性质相近的委员参加协商和讨论各种有关问题，对于工作组提出的意见和人民群众的来信来访，建立了接待和登记制度，并及时整理送交有关部门研究参考。要求做到事事有着落，件件有交代，对有关部门的答复和处理情况则定期向常委会汇报。此外，我们还建立了双周座谈会，主席、副主席办公会议，秘书长办公会议制度，以加强和各民主党派的工作联系，加强本会工作的领导与业务的推动。
    1957年是我国人民完成和超额完成第一个五年计划的最后一年，我们必须遵照毛主席在最高国务会议上的指示和这次大会的决议精神，大力开展政协工作，为进一步巩固与扩大人民民主统一战线，调动一切力量，为社会主义服务而努力。（附图片）
