　　Using Position to Buy and Sell Public Bonds
　  Li Dunyun Sentenced to Imprisonment
    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, March 23rd. Li Dunyun, an accountant from the Hunan Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau, abused his position to buy and sell public bonds, profiting from the transactions and undermining the credibility of the state's issuance of public bonds. On March 21st, at a public trial attended by 3,000 people in the North District People's Court of Changsha, he was sentenced to four years of imprisonment with forced labor reform.
    Li Dunyun was a businessman in the past. During the issuance of economic construction public bonds in 1954 and 1955, he used his position to underreport the amount of public bonds oversubscribed by the staff and workers of his organization and the amount of supplementary purchases to the bank. He also misappropriated cash from employees intended to purchase public bonds and, through the merchant Yang Fengbin, bought a total of 1,200 yuan in public bonds at 40% to 50% of their face value in four separate transactions from acquaintances, paying 580 yuan in cash. He then sold them to employees at the face value of the public bonds, profiting 620 yuan. After the masses exposed Li Dunyun's crimes, and they were verified by the procuratorate, the Changsha Municipal People's Procuratorate filed a public prosecution with the North District People's Court of Changsha.
