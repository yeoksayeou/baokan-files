I support Chairman Zhou Enlai's "Report on Visits to Eleven Asian and European Countries." The report points out that the general trend of the world is towards relaxation and progress. This is a scientific conclusion drawn from the complicated international situation, and it is also a general key to understanding the current international situation. I believe that we must study this conclusion well, firmly grasp this key, and transform it into our own real, flesh-and-blood thinking. Then, in the face of the ever-changing international situation, we will not be panic-stricken and wavering, but will confidently carry out tenacious and unremitting struggles for the cause of defending world peace, for the cause of socialist construction, and for all progressive undertakings of mankind, and make more and greater contributions.

Not long ago, I had the opportunity to visit the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and other countries as part of the National People's Congress delegation. As a delegation of the highest organ of state power – the parliament – we also held the purpose of "seeking three things": seeking friendship, seeking peace, and seeking knowledge. It can be said that through this friendly visit, the friendship and unity between us and the fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union have been further consolidated and developed, we have increasingly strengthened our confidence and strength in engaging in the struggle to defend peace, and we have also learned a lot of useful knowledge, especially the rich experience of how the Soviet Union's Soviet at all levels, the national assemblies of other fraternal countries, and the people's congresses at all levels mobilize the masses of the people to jointly manage state affairs.

This friendly visit gave me vivid impressions and profound feelings. Please allow me to take this brief opportunity to make a very brief report to comrades and friends.
Sincere and Profound Friendship with the Chinese People

First of all, what impressed us most was the deep comradely friendship of the people of the Soviet Union and other Eastern European brother countries towards the Chinese people. During our visit to the Soviet Union, we were warmly welcomed and cordially received by the Soviet people at all times and in all places. The Soviets called us "envoys of the great Chinese people," and whenever we met a Soviet person, we also encountered friendship like flesh and blood. Visiting the Kremlin was once a beautiful dream of so many kind people, but we had the opportunity to enter the Kremlin nine times. There, the leaders of the Supreme Soviet, the Party and the government of the Soviet Union met us, talked with us heartily, feasted us, and treated us to movies. In a Young Pioneer Palace in Leningrad, at a grand banquet in Tashkent, many of our elderly people, middle-aged people, and young people embraced, kissed, and sang and danced with Soviet children and laborers of all ethnic groups. When we took the train from Czechoslovakia through the Soviet Moldavian Republic to Romania, it was in the dead of night with snowflakes falling. The local Soviet, Party and government leaders came to welcome us. Afraid of disturbing our sleep, they attached a carriage to the rear of our train and followed us. The next morning, they came to our carriage to say hello. On the way back to China, our Tu-104 aircraft arrived in Amursk late at night. The comrades in the cabin were all asleep. Suddenly, local responsible comrades who had come to see us specially appeared in the cabin. They excitedly told us: "An event happened here yesterday, millions of farmers have received the glorious title of labor hero and medals." We congratulated them on their achievements and thanked them for their condolences. An hour later, when our plane began to taxi on the runway, we suddenly realized through the cabin window that these enthusiastic comrades were standing in the biting north wind and goose feather-like snowflakes, waving to us. In Czechoslovakia: In the silver-clad, picturesque, ancient and beautiful Prague, in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia on the banks of the Danube, in the industrial base of Ostrava, and in Karlovy Vary, the world-famous spa resort, we all lived in an atmosphere of warm friendship. Czechs and Slovaks treated us like their own brothers and sisters. In Romania, Dr. Groza, Chairman of the Presidium of the National Assembly, received us despite his illness, and also gave each of us a copy of his own book with his autograph: "Through this country of 600 million people." Bucharest, the capital of Romania, was shrouded in a festive atmosphere, with the national flags of China and Romania hanging everywhere. In Bulgaria, people welcomed representatives of fraternal countries with unbridled fervor. The cities of Ruse, Sofia, and Plovdiv were almost empty as people came to greet us. In this atmosphere of internationalist friendship that is higher than the sky and deeper than the sea, everyone of us has been profoundly educated. We all believe that this is friendship towards the 600 million Chinese people, it is a noble sentiment, and we should cherish this friendship and do our best to consolidate and develop it.
Economic Strength and National Defense Strength Have Grown Tremendously

Secondly, we saw with our own eyes the strong economic strength and national defense strength of the Soviet Union and other brother countries. The Soviet Union has completed the country's socialist industrialization at an unprecedented rate in human history, and has now become an industrial power with a high level of science and technology. In my poem "Ode to the Soviet Union," I once praised her like this:
	National economy shamed to be behind,
	Scientific civilization takes the lead,
	Living standards improve day by day,
	Needs are met, and hopes are fulfilled with sincerity.

Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and other countries have also become highly industrialized countries or very developed industrial-agricultural countries. At the same time, the national defense strength of these countries has also grown tremendously. Now, it can be said openly and boldly that the Soviet Union is not at all weaker than the United States in the manufacture of various new weapons, and even greatly surpasses the United States. Of course, we oppose wars of aggression, we advocate disarmament and the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons and thermonuclear weapons, and we are not believers in the theory of weapons alone; however, when imperialists are obsessed with wars of aggression and try their best to provoke wars, in order to effectively defend peace, we have no reason to disarm ourselves. We are excited to see that—from Czechoslovakia, the outpost of the socialist camp in the West, to the People's Republic of China, the outpost in the East—a battle line of unparalleled strength has been linked together. The restless, peace-wrecking claws of the aggressors, if they extend to the edge of this battle line, will be mercilessly cut off; if war is ignited elsewhere, threatening the peaceful life of mankind, they will also be fatally countered by the peace forces of the whole world, headed by the Soviet Union.
Practice Thrift and Work Hard

Finally, the spirit of hard work of the people of the Soviet Union and other brother countries has left us with an unforgettable impression. In the forty years since the founding of the Soviet Union, the people's lives have improved and improved greatly. However, people have not forgotten the difficult and arduous years of the civil war and the Patriotic War, but live a frugal life and work hard in production and labor. The movement to save metals, the movement to save raw materials, and the movement for rationalization proposals are being carried out vigorously in large and small enterprises. When we visited some factories, we found that they were still using old factory buildings and machinery and equipment. Many very old cars are still used in Moscow. The fertile land in the eastern part of the Soviet Union, which was originally desolate and uninhabited, has become densely populated with towns after decades of arduous reclamation by hundreds of thousands of young men and women. Developed industrial production, fruitful agricultural harvests, and affluent daily life are all the results of hard work. The spirit of hard work and selfless labor of the people of the Soviet Union and other brother countries cannot but remind us that our construction cause has just begun, and we must strictly implement the movement to increase production and practice economy. We must repeatedly make it clear to the people that this movement is by no means a passive, short-term, symptomatic measure, but an active, long-term, fundamental method of accumulating funds. Throughout ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, except for the extremely decadent, rotten and moldy parasitic classes, they all understand that only by increasing income and reducing expenditure can the source be long-lasting. The Chinese people, who are full of energy and are striving for the country's socialist industrialization, should look further ahead. For the benefit of ourselves and our future generations, each of us should strictly practice the movement to increase production and practice economy.

The above are some fragmentary but very profound impressions that I had during my visit. These impressions prove from the side Chairman Zhou Enlai's conclusion: "The ever-growing and united socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is invincible." I am slow in speech and clumsy in writing, and it is difficult to express my feelings. In the poem "Ode to the Soviet Union," which I wrote involuntarily, I wrote these two sentences:
	The truth is blessed, and all are auspicious,
	The candle illuminates the haze and vanishes in an instant!
That is to say: The newborn force, the progressive force is invincible, and the tragic wind and the black tide will definitely not last long. Truth and justice are on our side, and victory is on our side!

    社会主义阵营的力量是不可战胜的
    程潜谈访问苏、捷、罗、保四国的印象
    我拥护周恩来主席所作的“关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告”。报告指出：世界总的趋势是走向和缓、走向进步的。这是从错综复杂的国际局势中抽出来的科学结论，这也是理解当前国际形势的一个总的钥匙。我认为，必须好好地学习这个结论，牢牢地掌握这个钥匙，把它化为真正自己的、有血有肉的思想，然后，在风云变幻的国际局势面前，我们才不会惶惶愕愕，东摇西摆，而是信心百倍地为保卫世界和平的事业、为社会主义的建设事业、为一切人类的进步事业进行顽强不懈的斗争，作出更多更大的贡献。
    前不久，我有机会随全国人民代表大会代表团，到苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚等国进行了友好访问。作为国家最高权力机关——议会——的代表团，我们同样抱着“三寻”的目的：寻求友谊、寻求和平和寻求知识。可以说，经过这次友好访问，我们和苏联等兄弟国家的友谊和团结得到了进一步的巩固和发展，我们愈益增强了从事保卫和平斗争的信心和力量，我们也学习了许多有益的知识，特别是苏联各级苏维埃、其它兄弟国家的国民议会及各级人民代表会议如何发动人民群众共同管理国家事务的丰富的经验。
    这次友好访问给了我鲜明的印象和深刻的感受，请允许我借这个短短的发言机会，向同志们、朋友们作一个十分简要的汇报。对中国人民的真诚而深厚的友谊
    首先，使我们感受最深的是，苏联及东欧兄弟国家人民对中国人民的深厚的同志友谊。在苏联访问期间，我们无时无地不受到苏联人民的热烈欢迎和盛情款待。苏联人称呼我们为“伟大中国人民的使者”，我们遇到任何一个苏联人，同时也就遇到情同骨肉的友谊。参观克里姆林宫，曾经是多少善良人士的美丽想望，但我们却有机会九进克里姆林宫。在那里，苏联最高苏维埃、党和政府的领导人接见我们，和我们倾心交谈，欢宴我们，招待我们看电影。在列宁格勒的一个少年先锋宫里，在塔什干的一个隆重的宴会上，我们许多老年人、中年人、青年人，和苏联的孩子们、各族劳动者们一起拥抱、接吻和纵情歌舞。当我们乘火车从捷克斯洛伐克道经苏联摩尔达维亚共和国前赴罗马尼亚的时候，正是雪花飘舞的深更半夜，当地苏维埃、党和政府的领导者们前来欢迎我们，他们怕打扰了我们的睡眠，在我们乘坐的列车后挂了一节车厢尾随着，第二天一清早就到我们车厢内来问好。在归国途中，我们的图104飞机在夜阑人静时分到达阿木斯克，同志们在机舱内都睡着了，忽然，机舱内出现了专诚来看望我们的当地的负责同志，他们兴奋地告诉我们说：“昨天我们这里发生了一个事件，千百万农民得到了劳动英雄的光荣称号和奖章勋章”。我们祝贺他们的成就，感谢他们的慰问。一个钟头以后，当我们的飞机在跑道上开始滑行的时候，我们透过机舱玻璃，才猛然发现这几位热情的同志，在抖劲的北风下和鹅毛似的雪片里伫立着向我们挥手致意。在捷克斯洛伐克：在银装如画、古老美丽的布拉格，在多瑙河畔的斯洛伐克首府布拉迪斯拉发，在工业基地俄斯特拉发，在世界驰名温泉疗养胜地卡罗维发利，我们都生活在热情的友谊中。捷克人，斯洛伐克人，把我们当作亲兄弟姐妹一样款待和照顾。在罗马尼亚，国民议会主席团主席格罗查博士抱病接见我们，并且还送给我们每人一本有他亲笔签名的自己的著作：“经过这个六亿人民的国家”。罗马尼亚的首都——布加勒斯特市笼罩着一片节日的气氛，到处悬挂着中、罗两国的国旗。在保加利亚，人们以奔放的狂热来接待兄弟国家的代表，卢赛市、索非亚市和普罗夫迪夫市，几乎是万人空巷地来迎接我们。在这种比天还高、比海还深的国际主义的友谊氛围中，我们每个人都受到了深刻的教育。我们都认为，这是对六亿中国人民的友谊，这是一种崇高的情感，我们应当珍视这种友谊，应当倾全力巩固它和发展它。经济实力和国防实力都有巨大的增长
    其次，我们亲眼看到苏联等兄弟国家经济实力和国防实力的雄厚。苏联以人类历史上空前未有的速度完成了国家的社会主义工业化，现在已经成为一个具有高度科学技术水平的工业大国。在我的诗作“苏联颂”中，我曾经这样讴歌她：
    国民经济羞居后，
    科学文明走尚先，
    生活提高期日进，
    需能满望致心虔。捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚等国，也成为了高度工业化的国家或十分发达的工业——农业国家。同时，这些国家的国防实力也有了巨大的增长。现在，可以公开大胆地说，苏联在各种新式武器的制造方面完全不弱于美国，甚且大大超过美国。自然，我们反对侵略战争，我们主张裁减军备和禁止使用原子武器和热核子武器，我们更不是唯武器论的信徒；但是，当帝国主义者醉心于侵略战争，并千方百计地妄想挑动战争的时候，为了有效地保卫和平，我们没有任何理由解除自己的武装。我们兴奋地看到——从社会主义阵营在西方的前哨——捷克斯洛伐克，到东方的前哨——中华人民共和国，已经联结成为一个实力无比强大的战线。蠢蠢欲动的、渴望破坏和平的侵略者的血爪，如果伸向这条战线的边缘，就将被无情地斩断；如果在其它的地方燃起战火，威胁着人类的和平生活的话，它们也将遭到以苏联为首的全世界和平力量的致命回击。厉行节约艰苦奋斗
    最后，苏联等兄弟国家人民的艰苦奋斗的精神，给我们留下了永远不可磨灭的印象。苏联建国四十年，人民生活有了巨大的改善和提高。但是，人们并没有忘记内战时期和卫国战争时期那些艰难困苦的岁月，而是勤俭地过日子，奋发地生产和劳动。节约金属运动、节约原材料运动、合理化建议运动，在大小企业内都轰轰烈烈地展开。我们在参观一些工厂的时候，发现他们仍然在利用旧有的厂房和机器设备。许多年岁很老的汽车，仍然在莫斯科市内使用。原来是一片荒凉、人烟绝迹的苏联东部的肥田沃壤，经过数十万男女青年的艰苦垦荒，现在出现了人烟稠密的城镇。发达的工业生产，丰硕的农业收成，富裕的日常生活，所有这些，都是艰苦劳动的成果。苏联等兄弟国人民这种艰苦奋斗、忘我劳动的精神，使我们不能不联想到：我们的建设事业刚刚开始，必须严格地厉行增产节约运动。必须向人民反复地说清楚，这个运动绝对不是一个消极的、短期的、治标性的措施，而是一个积极的、长期的、根本性的积累资金的办法。古今中外，除了极度糜烂、腐朽发霉的寄生阶级以外，都懂得只有开源节流，才能源远流长的道理。精神焕发的、正在为国家社会主义工业化而努力的中国人民，眼睛应该看得更远一些。为我们自己、为我们后代子孙造福，对增产节约运动，我们每一个人都应当严格地身体力行。
    以上是我在访问期间的一鳞半爪的、但却十分深刻的印象，这些印象从侧面证明了周恩来主席的论断：“不断壮大的、团结一致的以苏联为首的社会主义阵营是不可战胜的。”我言钝笔拙，很难抒发自己的体会，在情不自禁地写出来的诗篇“苏联颂”中，我写下了这么两句话：
    熏垂真理咸临吉，
    烛照阴霾霎尔捐！这就是说：新生的力量、进步的力量是不可战胜的，惨厉的阴风和黑色的浪潮断然不能持久。真理正义在我们这边，胜利也就在我们这边！
