Title: Better Develop and Carry Forward Excellent Cultural Traditions - Ju Zan's Speech

Page: 3

Since studying the documents of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the 8th Congress of the Communist Party of China, and after listening to Chairman Mao's instructions and Premier Zhou's report these past few days, I personally feel that human culture will unfold a more splendid page. Besides being excited and inspired to welcome the arrival of the new stage, I have a few shallow thoughts to share here for the committee members to consider.

With the continuous and great victories of socialist countries and the imminent demise of imperialism's struggles, human thought has the potential to gradually converge. Within this convergence, besides summarizing the experiences of victories and setbacks, the excellent cultures of various countries and nationalities, past and present, will be integrated to enrich the content of Marxism-Leninism. Although all ideological, academic, and belief-based factions may not display their prominence as they once did, they can contribute their most correct, useful, and valuable aspects to all of humanity. I believe that anyone who loves truth and submits to truth can currently focus on this and begin working on it.

"Discard No Principle," "Discard No Skill"

As everyone knows, it is very difficult to carry out revolutionary struggles in countries ruled by the three great enemies. It is also a very heavy burden to carry out socialist construction in populous and underdeveloped countries. However, the Chinese Communist Party has made relatively few mistakes in leading the revolution and building the motherland. In particular, after the publication of the two articles on the dictatorship of the proletariat, the fairness, wisdom, and composure of the Chinese Communist Party are especially evident. This is certainly due to the ability of the CCP leaders to apply the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism in combination with the practice of the Chinese revolution, and also because they have the experience of the Soviet Union to draw on. However, I personally believe that it cannot be said to be unrelated to the excellent traditions in our culture. That is to say, the excellent traditions in our culture, consciously or unconsciously, deeply influence the thoughts, feelings, and habits of the Chinese people, and thus also become one of the conditions that play a decisive role in leading the revolution and building the motherland. This is certainly worth continuing to promote and recommend to all mankind. Unfortunately, since liberation, we have criticized traditional culture more than accepted it. Although we have done a lot of work and achieved many results in excavating, sorting out, and researching ancient academic thoughts, literature, and art, especially before and after the call for a hundred schools of thought to contend, many works merely play with nouns and concepts and treat it as a new evaluation of ancient culture, but in fact, they have not touched its ideological essence. Since the ideological essence has not been touched, it is very vague to talk about the progressive or reactionary role it played at the time and in later generations. Previously, without the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism, it was quite difficult to explore whether ancient culture contained a substance that conformed to objective truth. Now, with the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism, as long as we abandon sectarian and dogmatic prejudices and think deeply and more objectively, I think it is not difficult to touch the essence of ancient culture. Once the essence of ancient culture is revealed, talking about its excellent traditions will have a basis, and the new culture of the motherland can truly be as rich, colorful, broad, and solemn as a hundred flowers blooming. I hope that in addition to the call for "discarding no person, discarding no thing," we can add "discard no principle" and "discard no skill."

Excavate Valuable Materials from Religion

I would also like to talk about religion. I remember in March 1954, I suggested to the Academy of Sciences that the materials related to life phenomena preserved in religion be collected, researched and experimented with scientific methods, and then applied to increase people's health, wisdom, and prolong life. I don't know how the Academy of Sciences considered and dealt with this proposal at the time, but more than a year later, facts proved that my proposal was correct and in line with science. This shows that although the essence of religion and its role in past societies has been determined, the various experiences and wisdom of the sages preserved in religion for thousands of years are still worth valuing and excavating. Especially in Buddhism, there is a considerable amount of rich material on issues such as relative and absolute truth, epistemology, and psychological analysis, which can be used for thinkers' reference. The historical materials of its relationship with all aspects of Chinese culture should also be sorted out and studied for historians to consult. I think there must be many valuable materials in other religions that can be excavated. In addition, from the sorting and research of religious materials, some problems in human thought can also be discovered. If these problems are explored with scientific ideological methods, the content of truth can also be enriched. Therefore, I hope that Buddhists and followers of other religions will work hard to study science and Marxism-Leninism in order to excavate the valuable materials preserved in religion, solve the problems discovered, and contribute them to all of humanity, so that it can also become a force to promote the progress of human culture. At the same time, I hope that Marxists-Leninists will respect such efforts and provide support and assistance when necessary, because only in this way can the religious problem be truly solved.

Due to the leap in the progress of human culture and the thriving development of our country's socialist construction, new problems or tasks have been put forward in all aspects (including the religious circles), and the people's demands on the cadres who play a core role in various undertakings have also increased. They demand that the cadres' cultural level, professional level, and political cultivation can adapt to the development of society. They demand that the work of correcting deviations and mistakes be put on the agenda of every unit, and that emphasis should be placed on making fewer mistakes, and avoiding all remarks that may cause misunderstanding by those who dare to make mistakes. This demand is certainly for the good of the country, to avoid detours and losses in the construction cause, and also an expression of trust in the Party and the cadres. I firmly believe that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party, various measures will certainly be taken to gradually meet the demands of the people, and then achieve a general consensus in the people of the whole country. Starting from this consensus, through various conversations or meetings of different scopes and natures, and then achieving a general consensus with the people of socialist countries, and at the same time, making some necessary preparations for adopting useful components of science and technology in capitalist countries, it will certainly play a great role in safeguarding world peace and promoting the development and improvement of human culture.

Looking around at the present and looking forward to the future, I feel extremely happy. I wish all the committee members a happy mood and both longevity and health.

### 更好地发扬优良文化传统  巨赞的发言

    更好地发扬优良文化传统
    巨赞的发言
    自从学习了苏联共产党第二十次代表大会和我国共产党第八次代表大会的文件之后，这几天又听到了毛主席的指示和周总理的报告，我个人觉得，人类文化将展开更为灿烂的一页，除了欢欣鼓舞迎接新阶段的到来之外，有一点浅薄的感想拟在这里谈谈，向各位委员请教。
    随着社会主义国家的不断取得伟大胜利，帝国主义挣扎不久，就会灭亡，人类思潮有大体上逐渐趋向于一致的可能。在这个一致当中，除了总结取得胜利和遭受挫折的经验以外，还将融化过去和现在各个国家各个民族的优秀文化，以丰富马列主义的内容。一切思想上学术上以及信仰上的派别，虽然不一定还会像过去那样显示它的头角，而能够把它最正确最有用和最有价值的东西贡献于全人类。凡是热爱真理服从真理的人，我以为，目前可以着眼于此，着手于此。
    “无弃理”，“无弃术”
    大家知道，在三大敌人统治的国家里进行革命斗争是很困难的，在人口众多生产不发达的国家里进行社会主义建设，担子也非常沉重，而中国共产党在领导革命和建设祖国的过程中所犯的错误较少；特别是论无产阶级专政的两篇文章发表以后，格外显示出中国共产党的公正睿智与心平气和。这固然是由于中共领导人能够运用马列主义的基本原则结合中国革命的实践，又有苏联的经验可资取法的关系，但我个人认为不能说与我国文化中的优良传统无关。这就是说，我国文化中的优良传统，在有意无意之间，深深地影响着中国人民的思想感情与生活习惯，因而在领导革命和建设祖国的事业中也成为发生决定作用的条件之一。这当然是值得继续发扬和向全人类推荐的。可惜，解放以来，我们对于传统文化，批判有余而接受不足；对于古代学术思想文学艺术的发掘整理与研究，虽然在号召百家争鸣的前后，已经做了不少工作，也有不少成绩，但是有许多著作，只是玩弄一下名词和概念，就作为对古代文化的一种新的估价，而其实并没有接触到它的思想实质。思想实质既然没有接触到，就要来谈它在当时和后世所起的进步或反动作用，那就很恍惚了。以前没有马列主义的思想武器，要探索古代文化中是否含有符合于客观真理的实质，是相当困难的；现在有了马列主义的思想武器，只要摒除宗派和教条的成见，深思一下，客观一些，我认为是不难接触到古代文化的实质的。古代文化的实质揭露出来了，再谈它的优良传统才有所依据，才能使祖国的新文化真像百花齐放一样，丰富多采，阔大庄严。我希望在“无弃人、无弃物”的号召之外，加上“无弃理”“无弃术”。
    发掘宗教中的宝贵资料
    话又要谈到宗教上来。记得1954年3月，我曾经向科学院建议：把保存在宗教里面的有关生命现象的资料收集起来，用科学方法进行研究和实验，再加以应用，可以增进人民的健康、智慧和延长寿命。当时科学院对于这个建议如何考虑与处理，我不知道，可是过了一年多，事实证明我的建议是正确的，合于科学的。这说明，宗教的本质和它在过去社会所发生的作用虽然已有定论，而几千年来保存在宗教里面的先哲的各种经验与智慧，还是值得重视和发掘的。特别是在佛教里面，关于相对真理与绝对真理、认识论、心理分析等方面的问题，都有相当丰富的资料，可供思想家的参考。它和我国文化各方面发生关系的史料，当然也应该整理与研究，以备历史学家的咨询。我想，别的宗教里面，一定也同样有许多宝贵的资料，可以发掘。此外，从宗教资料的整理与研究上，还可以发现人类思想上的一些问题。对这些问题，如果用科学的思想方法探索下去，也可以使真理的内容更加丰富。因此，我希望佛教徒以及其它宗教徒努力学习科学和马列主义，以便把保存在宗教里面的宝贵资料发掘出来，并把发现的问题加以解决，贡献于全人类，使它也成为推动人类文化进步的一种力量。同时希望马列主义者尊重这样的努力，并在必要的时候予以支持与协助。因为只有这样才能真正解决宗教问题。
    由于人类文化飞跃的进步，由于我国社会主义建设事业的蒸蒸日上，各方面（包括宗教界在内）都提出了新的问题或任务，人民群众对于在各种事业中起核心作用的干部，要求就提高了。他们要求干部的文化水平业务水平和政治修养都能与社会的发展相适应，他们要求把纠正偏差和错误的工作提到每一个单位的日程上来，而且要强调少犯错误，避免一切可以引起敢于犯错误者误解的言论。这种要求当然是为了国家好，为了建设事业少走弯路，少受损失，也是相信党和干部的一种表示。我深信，在毛主席和党的英明领导下，一定能够采取各种措施，逐渐满足人民群众的这种要求，进而在全国人民中取得认识上大体的一致。从这个一致出发，通过各种范围不同性质不同的交谈或会议，再进而与社会主义国家的人民也取得认识上大体的一致，同时在采取资本主义国家科学技术等方面的有用成分上，作些必要的准备工作，则对于保卫世界和平，促进人类文化的发展与提高，一定会发挥很大的作用。
    环顾当前，瞻望未来，我感到无比的高兴。敬祝各位委员心情愉快，既寿且康。
