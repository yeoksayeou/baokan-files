Xinhua News Agency, Sanmenxia, March 28th: To welcome the construction of the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station project, cadres and workers under the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau are universally intensifying their technical and cultural studies.

　　The No. 1 Dam Construction Branch Bureau is the main force in the first phase of the project. More than 95% of the workers in this branch bureau are participating in technical or cultural studies. Some engineering teams have formed specialized cultural and technical schools. The schools use construction textbooks compiled and taught by veteran workers who participated in the construction of the Guanting, Douhe, and Dahuo Fang reservoirs. Young technicians such as Zhao Dexiang and Wang Yongcheng serve as algebra teachers.

　　The Sanmenxia Yellow River Engineering Bureau has a technical school where Zhang Haifeng, Second Secretary of the CCP Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau Committee, Xie Hui, Deputy Director of the Engineering Bureau, and eight or nine other leading cadres are students. The lecture content is about the forty-four drawings related to construction.

　　Old cadres Zhao Weixi and Tang Lifu, who came from rural areas and served as county magistrates or did Party work for many years in the countryside, are now leaders of auxiliary enterprises. They are self-studying various science subjects of junior high school, planning to complete their self-study in one year.

　　Not long ago, the engineering technicians of the No. 1 Dam Construction Branch Bureau of the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau provided six excavation plans for the first phase of the Sanmenxia foundation excavation project. The bureau's "Science Palace" organized a lively and interesting "Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" discussion for this purpose. Li Eding, Chief Engineer of Sanmenxia, ​​once gave a report on the project introduction in this "Science Palace."

　　Many young technicians in the Design Branch Bureau of the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau are working hard to study Russian. Some have been studying for a year and can now read professional books. Technician Wang Zubian originally studied hydraulic engineering. To meet the needs of his work, he studied geology, water supply and drainage, and other specialized scientific knowledge. He was recently promoted to engineer.

　　The Engineering Bureau has also sent more than a thousand skilled workers to Beijing, Fushun, Tianjin, Zhengzhou, and other places to learn the operating techniques of electric shovels and other machinery.

　　为了更好地工作
　　职工加紧学技术
    新华社三门峡28日电  为迎接三门峡水电站工程施工，三门峡工程局所属的干部和职工普遍在加紧学习技术和文化。
    坝工第一分局是第一期工程的施工主力，这个分局有95％以上的工人参加了技术或文化课的学习，有些工程队组成了专业文化技术学校。学校由曾经参加过修官厅、陡河、大伙房等水库的老工人编写施工教材和担任教员；由赵德祥、王永成等青年技工担任代数教员。
    黄河三门峡工程局有个技术学校，中共三门峡工程局委员会第二书记张海峰、工程局副局长谢辉和其他八九位领导干部，是这个学校的学生，讲课内容是有关施工的四十四张图纸。
    从农村来的老干部赵维喜、汤丽夫等，在农村当过多年县长或做党的工作，现在是辅属企业的领导者，他们正在自修初级中学的各门理科，计划一年自修完。
    不久以前，三门峡工程局坝工第一分局的工程技术人员，为三门峡第一期基础开挖工程提供了六个开挖方案，这个局的“科学宫”为此组织过一次热烈有趣的“百家争鸣”的讨论会。三门峡总工程师李鹗鼎曾在这个“科学宫”里作过工程介绍的报告。
    三门峡工程局设计分局的很多青年技术员在刻苦地钻研俄文，有些学习了一年，现在已经能阅读专业性的书籍了。技术员汪祖汴本来是学水工的，为了工作需要，他学习了地质与上下水道等专门科学知识，不久前，已被提升为工程师了。
    工程局先后还派出了一千多技术工人，在北京、抚顺、天津、郑州等地学习电铲和其他机械的操作技术。
