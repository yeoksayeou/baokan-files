"On the National Water Conservancy Resources and Governance Achievements Map, I saw the river distribution of our great motherland and the water conservancy construction blueprint spread all over the country. My impression is so deep and unforgettable. Coming to the Water Conservancy Hall is a blessing, because I am a citizen living in such a rich and beautiful motherland." This is what a visitor left in the opinion book of the Water Conservancy Hall at the National Agricultural Exhibition.

The fact is that, in the seven years from 1950 to 1956, China carried out large-scale flood control and farmland water conservancy projects, excavating a total of 7.7 billion cubic meters of earth. This huge number is equivalent to excavating 105 Suez Canals. During the same period, eight large reservoirs and eleven large-scale sluice gates were also built.

The Meishan Reservoir arch dam, which is 88.24 meters high, and the Xianghongdian Reservoir gravity dam, which is under construction, are both unprecedented miracles in the history of Chinese water conservancy. In the Water Conservancy Hall, what you see of the Meishan Reservoir is only a model reduced to one two-hundred-and-fiftieth of its original size, but it already makes people feel quite magnificent. The high dam of this reservoir has already surpassed the Bartoletto arch dam in the United States, which claims to be the world's first. What is even more commendable is that the design of this arch dam is the work of a group of Chinese college students and their predecessors. With this reservoir, 720,000 mu of land in the Shi River basin will be irrigated, and the Meishan Hydropower Station will be able to send 40,000 kilowatts of electricity to vast cities and rural areas.

Why is the model of the Baisha Irrigation Canal so interesting? It turns out that here you can see China's first irrigation canal using large reservoir storage. The water volume can irrigate 250,000 mu of farmland, and can increase grain production by more than 37 million jin per year (enough for 100,000 people to eat for a year). The local people call it the "Golden Canal".

The schematic diagram of the Huai River long-term plan is a moving picture. There you can see: twenty-seven reservoirs, hundreds of sluice gates, and twenty-five hydroelectric power stations will be built on a thousand-mile-long river channel. This grand plan will become a reality by 1967. By then, not only will 8 million mu of farmland in the Huai River basin be free from flood disasters, but the irrigation area can be expanded by more than 100 million mu.

In the Water Conservancy Hall, I further realized the profound meaning of Chairman Mao's saying that "water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture". In the more than 700 exhibits, it is fully reflected how water conservancy guarantees increased agricultural production. The models of the Jingjiang and Hanjiang flood diversion projects, two sister-like projects, tell us that the Jingjiang flood diversion area, controlled by the gates, can divert 6 billion cubic meters of floodwater, freeing 8 million mu of farmland from flooding disasters. In 1956, when the Han River experienced a major flood, the flood diversion area opened the gates for flood diversion many times, allowing fifteen counties to escape the disaster.

There is no doubt that people are very concerned about the fundamental treatment and development of the Yangtze River, the river with the greatest economic value in our country. On the charts here, we can see that the preparatory work for the fundamental treatment and development of the Yangtze River has already begun: more than 83,000 meters of geological drilling have been completed, 320,000 square kilometers have been surveyed, and 120,000 square kilometers have been measured....

"The Yellow River turns green, and the barren land becomes green mountains," this is the determination of the Chinese people to conquer the Yellow River, which has been unruly for thousands of years. Here you can see a luminous model that marks the 46-level cascade development and fundamental treatment plan for the Yellow River, and the heroic spirit of the workers working on the Sanmenxia Dam. Yu the Great's dredging of Longmen was originally a legend. The Sanmenxia Reservoir, which the people are about to build, with a water storage capacity of 64.7 billion cubic meters, a power generation capacity of 6 billion kilowatt-hours, and an irrigation area of 10 million mu of farmland, will be even more magnificent than this legend. When the grand plan for developing the Yellow River is realized, the 4,800-kilometer-long Yellow River trunk stream will become a series of lakes, and the water storage capacity will be able to transform China's famous arid northwest region into a rice-producing area like Jiangnan.

From an animated model, you can see how the Dahuo House Reservoir in Northeast China is being constructed. Sand dredgers take sand from the bottom of the river, small trains transport it, funnels transfer it, and belt conveyors transport the soil to the dam, and stone compactors begin to compact it... a whole set of mechanized joint operations. Such, and even better, mechanized operations are the development prospects of China's water conservancy cause.

The miniature of Guanting Reservoir, a man-made lake west of Beijing, is also displayed here in front of you: the high dam, the water intake tower standing in the lake, and the water diversion tunnel traversing the mountains are the hubs for controlling the 2.27 billion cubic meters of water stored in the reservoir. The water supplied to the people of Beijing by the Yongding River flows out of this treasure house.

Everyone admits that China is one of the countries with the most developed water conservancy undertakings in the world. In the years since liberation, we have been working hard to grasp the water in the sky and underground in our hands. Please look at this chart! The national irrigated area has been expanded from the original 300 million mu to more than 500 million mu, and the horsepower of water pumps has increased from the original 120,000 horsepower to 390,000 horsepower. In the past few years, 139 rural hydropower stations have been built, 200 million mu of soil and water conservation areas have been controlled, 8 million wells have been dug, 10 million ponds and small reservoirs have been built, and 1.8 million waterwheels have been added. This is a strong guarantee for increased agricultural production. In Shijiazhuang, the yield of grain per mu in non-irrigated areas is only 397 jin, but after irrigation, the yield per mu is 1,000 jin.

The "Sihe Reservoir" in Liling County, Hunan Province, is a representative of small reservoirs in the south. Such small reservoirs have been widely built in the southern hilly areas. Its function is to intercept and store the water on the ground for use when there is a shortage of water. The earth dam is the main body of the small reservoir, and the spillway is the "safe door" of the small reservoir. This small reservoir can store 80 cubic meters of water. With this reservoir, the local area had a drought for 70 days last year, and still achieved a bumper harvest. This is just as a slogan says: "Building reservoirs is like building granaries, and accumulating water is like accumulating grain."

China has 1.54 million square kilometers of soil erosion area. In the Yellow River basin alone, 1.38 billion tons of sediment are washed away by the river water every year. How to prevent this phenomenon? Jiuyuan Gully answers this question: on a model shaped like a mulberry leaf, watersheds and forests, ridge cultivation areas, field boundary ridges, siltation dams, terraces, etc. are all over it, so that soil and water are conserved.

In the middle of the Water Conservancy Hall, there is a set of domestically produced water conservancy instruments, showing that China's water conservancy science is developing rapidly. In the past, these instruments had to be bought from abroad. Now, many can be manufactured by ourselves, and some can even be exported. The water conservancy construction team is also growing, and currently 41 water conservancy institutes and schools have been established, 8 research institutes and hydraulic test stations, 64 hydrological forecasting stations, 20 soil and water conservation test stations, and nearly 300 water conservancy soil test stations. All of these have laid a good foundation for the development of China's water conservancy undertakings in the future.

China is a country with high mountains, long rivers, and numerous rivers. On the vast territory, there are more than 1,600 major rivers and numerous lakes, which provide excellent conditions for socialist construction. The average annual total water volume is 268 billion cubic meters, more than twice that of the United States, which can be used to generate more than 500 million kilowatts of electricity and irrigate vast farmland. In order to overcome water disasters and develop water conservancy, we are advancing towards the Huai River, Yangtze River, Yellow River, Pearl River, Heilongjiang River, Songhua River, and Yarlung Zangbo River. We believe that in the not-too-distant future, we can make the waves of every river calm and the land golden with rice and wheat.

    “水利是农业的命脉”
    ——记全国农业展览会水利馆	洪崖
   “在全国水利资源和治理成就图上，我看到了伟大祖国的河流公布状况，看到了遍布全国的水利建设蓝图，我的印象是那么深刻难忘。来到水利馆就是一种幸福，因为我是生活在这样丰满美丽的祖国的公民。”这是一位观众在全国农业展览会水利馆的意见簿上留下的话。
    事实就是这样，我国从1950年到1956年的七年间，大规模的治理水患和兴修农田水利工程，共挖土七十七亿公方。这个巨大的数字，相等于开挖一百零五条苏伊士运河。在这同一期间，八座大水库和十一座大型水闸也建成了。
    那座高达八十八点二四公尺的梅山水库连拱坝和正在兴建的响洪甸水库重力坝，都是中国水利史页上从所未有的奇迹。在水利馆，你所看到的梅山水库只不过是一个缩小为二百五十分之一的模型就已经使人觉得颇为壮观了。这座水库的高坝，已经压倒了美国号称世界第一的巴托雷托连拱坝。更值得骄矜的是，这座连拱坝的设计，是出自我国一群大学生和他们的前辈合作的手笔。有了这座水库，史河流域的七十二万亩土地就有水滋润，梅山水电站就能把四万基罗瓦特的电能送向广大城市和乡村。
    白沙灌溉渠的模型为什么那么叫人发生兴趣？原来在这里可以看到我国第一个利用大型水库蓄水灌溉渠道。水量可以灌溉二十五万亩农田，每年能增产三千七百多万斤粮食（足够十万人吃一年）。当地人民把它叫做“金渠”。
    治淮远景规划示意图，是一张动人的图画。在那里可以看到：在一条千里长的河道上，要建立起二十七座水库、数百座水闸和二十五个水电站。这个宏伟的计划，到1967年都将变成现实。到那时，不仅淮河流域八百万亩农田可以免除洪水的灾害，而且可以扩大灌溉面积一亿多亩。
    在水利馆，我进一步认识了毛主席说的“水利是农业的命脉”这句话的深刻意义。在七百多件展品中，都充分地体现了水利怎样保证农业增产。荆江和汉江两个姊妹式的分洪工程的模型告诉我们：荆江分洪区经过闸门的控制，可以分泄六十亿公方的洪水，使八百万亩农田免受泛滥的灾害。1956年汉江发生大水，分洪区多次开闸分洪，使十五个县免遭水灾。
    毫无疑问，人们对长江——我国经济价值最大的河流的根治和开发是非常关怀的。在这里的图表上，我们可以看到根治长江、开发长江的准备工作已经开始了：完成地质钻探八万三千多公尺、勘查了三十二万平方公里，测量了十二万平方公里……。
   “黄河流碧水，赤地变青山”，这是我国人民征服千年不驯的黄河的决心。你在这里能看到标明了四十六级梯形开发和根治黄河的计划的发光模型，和正在三门峡上工作的工人的豪迈的神气。夏禹凿龙门，原是一个传说。人民就要兴建的蓄水六百四十七亿公方、发电六十亿度、灌溉千万亩农田的三门峡水库，将比这个传说更加壮丽。当开发黄河的宏伟计划实现以后，四千八百多公里的黄河干流就会变成一连串的湖泊，蓄水量就能把我国著名的西北干旱地区变成像江南一样的水稻产区。
    从一个活动模型可以看到：东北地区的大伙房水库正在怎样建设着。取沙船从河底取沙，小火车起运，漏斗转卸，皮带输送机把土运到大坝，压石机开始压实……一整套机械化联合作业。这样的，甚至比这更好的机械化作业，是我国水利事业的发展前景。
    北京西边的一个人造湖——官厅水库的缩影在这里也展示在你的面前：那座高高的大坝，耸立在湖中的进水塔，还有横穿山峦的输水隧洞，是控制水库里二十二亿七千万公方的蓄水的枢纽。永定河供给北京人民的水，就是从这个宝库里流出来的。
    谁都承认中国是世界上水利事业最发达的国家之一。在解放后的几年来，我们正在努力把天上和地下的水掌握在我们的手里。请你看这幅图表吧！全国灌溉面积已由原有的三亿亩扩大到五亿多亩，抽水机由原来的十二万匹马力增加到三十九万匹马力。几年来兴建农村水电站一百三十九处，控制水土保持面积二亿亩，打井八百万眼，兴修塘堰、小型水库一千万处，增加水车一百八十万架。这就是农业增产的有力保证。石家庄市没有灌溉的地方每亩只产粮三百九十七斤，灌溉以后每亩产粮一千斤。
    湖南省醴陵县的“四和水库”，是南方小水库的代表。南方丘陵地区已经普建了这样的小水库，它的作用是拦蓄地面上的水，待缺水的时候使用。土坝是小水库的主体，溢洪道就是小水库的“太平门”。这个小水库能蓄水八十公方。有这个水库，去年当地七十天不雨，还获得了丰收。这恰如一幅标语上所说的：“修库如修仓，积水如积粮。”
    我国有一百五十四万平方公里的水土流失面积。光是黄河流域，每年就有十三点八亿万吨的泥沙被河水冲走。怎样防止这种现象？韭园沟回答了这个问题：在一个形似桑叶的模型上，布满分水岭和林木、垅作区田、地边埂、淤地坝、梯田等等，这样，水土就被保持住了。
    在水利馆的当中有一组国产水利仪器，显示了我国水利科学事业在飞速发展。过去，这些仪器都要从国外买回来，现在，很多都可以自己制造，有的还可以出口。水利建设队伍也在日益壮大，目前已建立了水利院、校四十一所，研究院和水工试验站八处，水文预报站六十四处，水土保持试验站二十处，水利土壤试验站近三百处。这些都为我国今后的水利事业的发展打下了良好的基础。
    我国是个山高水长、河流众多的国家。在广阔的疆土上，分布着一千六百多条主要河川，还有星罗棋布般的湖泊，都为社会主义建设提供了优越的条件。年平均总水量二千六百八十亿立方，胜过美国两倍有余，能被利用发电五亿多瓩，也能灌溉广大农田。为了战胜水害，发挥水利，我们正在向淮河、长江、黄河、珠江、黑龙江、松花江、雅鲁藏布江大进军。我们相信，在不太久的将来，就可以使条条河水浪花平静，块块土地稻麦金黄。
