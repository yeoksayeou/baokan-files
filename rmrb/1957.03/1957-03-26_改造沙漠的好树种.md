Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot Telegram A type of tree that can grow in the desert has been discovered in the Gobi (desert) within the Bayannur League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

This tree is called the Haloxylon ammodendron. According to observations and experiments by technicians from the Inner Mongolia Forestry Science Research Institute, Haloxylon ammodendron seeds can generally germinate in three to four hours when sown on the desert. If the temperature is between 20 and 23 degrees Celsius, the germination time is only half an hour. This tree has the characteristics of being cold and drought resistant, and is easy to cultivate in the desert. The deserts within the territory of the First Baga (township) of Ejin Banner in Bayannur League are covered with this tree, which local herders call the "sea of trees."

The head of the Inner Mongolia Forestry Science Research Institute recently told reporters that the deserts in Inner Mongolia are contiguous, and in some leagues, deserts and sand dunes account for more than 70% of the total area. Because there are no trees in the desert areas, rainfall is scarce, and the land is extremely barren, which seriously affects the lives of the local people. The discovery of the Haloxylon ammodendron will play a significant role in the work of transforming deserts into arable land.

　　改造沙漠的好树种
    新华社呼和浩特电　一种能在沙漠里生长的树，已在内蒙古自治区巴彦淖尔盟境内的戈壁（沙漠）上发现。
    这种树名叫索索树。根据内蒙古林业科学研究所技术人员的观察试验，索索树的种子撒在沙漠上，一般三到四个小时即可发芽，温度在摄氏二十到二十三度之间，发芽时间只要半个小时。这种树有抗寒抗旱的特性，很容易在沙漠里培植。巴彦淖尔盟额济纳旗第一巴嘎（乡）境内的沙漠上，到处都生长着这种树，当地牧民称为“树海”。
    内蒙古林业科学研究所负责人最近告诉记者说，内蒙古境内沙漠毗连，有的盟境内沙漠和沙丘占到总面积的70％以上。由于沙漠地带没有树木，雨量稀少，土地极为贫瘠，严重地影响了当地人民的生活。索索树的发现，对于改造沙漠为良田的工作将起很大作用。
