    Chen Jingkai's 135.5 kg Two-Hand Clean and Jerk
    Officially Recognized as World Record
    Xinhua News Agency, 4th — Chinese featherweight weightlifter Chen Jingkai's national record of 135.5 kg in the two-hand clean and jerk, set in Shanghai on November 29, 1956, has been recognized as an official world record.

    The All-China Sports Federation received today from the International Weightlifting and Bodybuilding Federation a list of twenty-eight official world weightlifting records as of February 1, 1957. Chen Jingkai's new clean and jerk record has replaced his old world record of 133 kg in the featherweight two-hand clean and jerk, set in Shanghai on June 7, 1956.

    Chen Jingkai set this new world record in Shanghai while the 16th Olympic Games were being held in Melbourne. This new world record is higher than the two-hand clean and jerk record of 132.5 kg set by the featherweight weightlifting champion of the 16th Olympic Games, American athlete Vinci. South Korean athlete Ok Yeong-ho's two-hand clean and jerk performance at the 16th Olympic Games reached 135 kg, but at that time his weight exceeded the prescribed standard of 56 kg, so his record was not recognized.

    Chen Jingkai's two-hand clean and jerk performance in Guangzhou on November 11, 1956, reached 135 kg. On November 18, his two-hand clean and jerk performance in Wuhan was further improved to 135.5 kg, but his weight exceeded the prescribed standard of 56 kg at that time. This time, his weight and the weight of the barbell were measured on the spot and met the standards, so after application, this achievement was recognized by the International Weightlifting and Bodybuilding Federation.

    陈镜开双手挺举一百三十五点五公斤
    已被承认为正式世界纪录
    据新华社4日讯  中国最轻量级举重运动员陈镜开1956年11月29日在上海创造的一百三十五点五公斤的双手挺举全国最高纪录，已经被承认为正式的世界纪录。
    中华全国体育总会今天收到的国际举重和健身联合会寄来的截至1957年2月1日为止的二十八项举重正式世界纪录表中，陈镜开的这项挺举新成绩，已代替了他1956年6月7日在上海创造的最轻量级双手挺举一百三十三公斤的旧世界纪录。
    陈镜开在上海创造这项世界新纪录的时候，第十六届奥林匹克运动会正在墨尔本举行。这项世界新纪录比第十六届奥林匹克运动会最轻量级举重冠军、美国运动员温奇双手挺举的纪录还要高，温奇只举起了一百三十二点五公斤。南朝鲜运动员玉英何在第十六届奥林匹克运动会上双手挺举的成绩曾经达到一百三十五公斤，但是当时他的体重超过了五十六公斤的规定标准，因此他的这个纪录没有得到承认。
    陈镜开1956年11月11日在广州双手挺举的成绩曾经达到一百三十五公斤。11月18日，他在武汉双手挺举的成绩又提高到一百三十五点五公斤，但是那次他的体重超过了五十六公斤的规定标准。这次，他的体重和所举的杠铃当场称量都合乎标准，因此经申请后，这个成绩得到了国际举重和健身联合会的承认。
