Disaster Areas Need to Conserve Even More

Although the natural disasters suffered by some regions of our country last year were even more severe than in 1954, thanks to the good work done in production and disaster relief under the conditions of basic cooperativization, the severe winter has been safely weathered. Some disaster areas have already eliminated the famine in winter, some disaster areas no longer show any signs of disaster, and the lives of disaster victims are almost the same as in normal years. The superiority of socialism is particularly evident in disaster areas.

The gratifying achievements also have their worrying side: precisely because the people in disaster areas are satisfied with the disaster relief work of the Party and the government, and they know that the People's Government is responsible for the disaster victims, some people have developed a dependence mentality. Some disaster victims incorrectly place all their hopes on government relief, and even composed such songs: "Rape flowers bloom all over the fields, cooperatives are stronger than working alone, if there is no grain, look for the warehouse, if there is no money, look for the bank." As a result, many wasteful phenomena have occurred in disaster areas. There is a lack of attention to conserving grain, a lack of careful calculation, and a lack of earnest collection of substitute foods. Some disaster victims do not make long-term plans, or treat lean years as if they were bumper years, spending money as soon as they get it, earning as much as they eat. What happens after they have spent everything? "Anyway, there is government relief." This phenomenon is particularly serious in areas where sideline production has been successful. For example, in the disaster area of ​​Guiyang County, Hunan Province, farmers generally eat three meals of rice a day, and 60% of the households in the county brew wine. Ordinary households brew one or two vats of wine per household, and some brew three or four vats, each vat requiring fifteen to twenty catties of rice. In the Longtang Agricultural Cooperative of Shaodong County, 6,586 catties of grain were used for brewing wine by various households after the disaster, enough to feed eighteen disaster victims for a year. In Shiwanzhen Township, Hengshan County, thirty-six families held feasts after the autumn harvest, making a total of three hundred and ninety-three tables; the director of the supervisory committee of an agricultural cooperative "celebrated his birthday" at the age of thirty, slaughtered a pig, ate three hundred catties of grain, and spent ninety yuan. In Cixi County, Zhejiang Province, a township cadre in Cao Hai Township held seventeen tables of banquets for his wedding, consuming more than two hundred yuan in one meal. In Yan Gezhuang, Daxing County, a disaster area in Hebei Province, twelve cooperative members engaged in transportation spent eighteen yuan on one meal in Beijing. Who can believe that this is happening in a disaster area?

Thrift is one of the basic methods of building socialism and also the fine tradition of the working people of our country. Non-disaster areas should be thrifty, let alone disaster areas! This principle is very obvious. Some of the wasteful phenomena that have occurred in disaster areas should have been corrected by educating the disaster victims long ago. However, some cadres in disaster areas have some incorrect ideas. Some cadres mistakenly believe that socialism has been realized and that the living standards of the masses should be improved, so there is no need to advocate thrift to overcome famine, let alone ask the masses to collect substitute foods. Some cadres mistakenly believe that caring for the suffering of disaster victims means simply relying on the government to provide grain and money for "support." Some cadres do not go deep into the grassroots to understand the situation, but only listen to reports, follow others in shouting, blindly exaggerating the disaster situation, only caring about reaching out to higher authorities for money and grain, and their tone is getting louder and louder. These thoughts of certain cadres have also fueled the dependence mentality of the masses. As a result, many wasteful phenomena have also occurred in the distribution of relief funds.

The natural disasters in 1956 were particularly serious, and the natural disaster relief funds allocated by the state were more than in any previous year. From a global perspective, this is necessary and indispensable. However, this does not mean that the distribution to every place and to every disaster victim is very appropriate. Some places received more relief funds than they actually needed, and the phenomenon of wasting relief funds became serious. First, the principle of using special funds for special purposes was not strictly implemented, and relief funds were diverted to other uses, even to buy radios and build offices. Second, the distribution was egalitarian, with everyone getting a share. As a result, some places received very little per person, and households that were not in difficulty squandered the money, while households in difficulty still had not solved their problems. In some places, everyone received a certain amount of relief funds, allowing households in difficulty to overcome the famine, while households not in difficulty lived even better, and the state's relief funds were overspent. In either case, it shows that the egalitarian distribution method is incorrect. Giving relief to people who do not need it will inevitably lead to waste; people who need relief may also squander it by eating and drinking extravagantly immediately after receiving relief funds, or even using it for gambling. These are the inevitable results of the development of dependence and support mentality.

During the period of socialist construction, all expenditures of the state are carefully calculated. It is not easy to allocate a large amount of relief funds. We should cherish it all the more. The amount of relief funds is always limited, and it should play the role of guaranteeing the lives of disaster victims and promoting production in disaster areas. The main way to enable disaster victims to safely overcome the famine is still "production for self-relief and thrift to overcome the famine." The fact that cooperatives are stronger than working alone is not reflected in "looking for warehouses if there is no grain and looking for banks if there is no money," but in the facts of increasing productivity and promoting production development. If there is no grain, it must be found from agricultural production; if there is no cash, it must be found from sideline production. In order to overcome the famine, it is necessary not only to be thrifty, but also to work hard to produce. It is unavoidable that the living standards in disaster areas are lower than in normal years. It is also necessary to mix in some substitute foods. The most reliable thing is to increase production and practice thrift. If everyone relies solely on the government, then who does the government rely on? To support all the people in the disaster area is actually to have the people in the bumper harvest areas support the people in the disaster area, which is not only impossible, but also should not be done.

Generally speaking, the disaster areas in 1956 did a good job in production, but many disaster areas did a poorer job in thrift. Now that the spring plowing season has arrived, disaster areas should take another step forward on the basis of existing achievements in production. At the same time, they should quickly emphasize the issue of thrift, which was not paid enough attention to last year, establish a good atmosphere of thrift to overcome famine, oppose all wasteful phenomena, strictly control the use of relief funds, and overcome the idea of ​​relying on government relief. Of course, necessary government relief is still indispensable. During the spring famine period, relief work should still be done effectively so that those who should be given relief can receive it. In short, all relief funds must truly play the role of guaranteeing the lives of disaster victims and promoting production in disaster areas.

### 灾区更需要节约

    灾区更需要节约
    我国一些地区去年所受的自然灾害虽比1954年还重，但由于在基本合作化的条件下做好了生产救灾工作，严冬已经安全渡过。有些灾区已经把灾荒消灭在冬季，有些灾区已看不到什么灾象，灾民的生活同平常年景也差不多。社会主义的优越性，在灾区特别明显地表现了出来。
    令人欣喜的成绩，也有它令人担忧的另一面：正由于灾区人民对党和政府的救灾工作表示满意，他们知道人民政府是对灾民负责的，因而有一部分人发生了一种依赖思想。有些灾民不正确地把一切希望都放在政府救济上，甚至编出了这样的歌子：“油菜开花遍地黄，合作社比单干强，没有粮食找仓库，没有金钱找银行。”于是，在灾区发生了许多浪费的现象。不注意节约粮食，不注意精打细算，不认真收集代食品。有些灾民不作长期打算，或者歉收年景作丰收打算，有钱到手就花，挣多少吃多少。花完吃完以后怎么办呢？“反正有政府救济”。特别是在副业生产开展得有成绩的地区，这种现象就更为严重。如湖南省桂阳县灾区农民一般都是一天吃三餐干饭，全县有60％的户煮酒。一般户每户煮酒一、二缸，多的要煮酒三、四缸，每缸需米十五至二十斤。邵东县龙塘农业社灾后煮酒各户共用粮六千五百八十六斤，可供十八个灾民吃一年。衡山县石湾乡秋收后有三十六户人家作酒席，共作了三百九十三桌；一个农业社的监察委员会主任三十岁就“做寿”，杀了一头猪，吃了三百斤谷，花了九十元钱。浙江省慈溪县曹海乡的一个乡干部结婚，曾摆十七桌酒席，一餐就吃了二百多元。河北省灾区的大兴县严各庄有十二个社员搞运输，在北京吃一顿饭就花了十八元。谁能相信这是发生在灾区的事情呢？
    节约是建设社会主义的基本方法之一，也是我国劳动人民的优良传统。非灾区应当节约，何况灾区！这个道理是很明显的。灾区所发生的一些浪费现象，是早就应当教育灾民纠正的。可是，灾区的一部分干部却有一些不正确的想法。有些干部误认为社会主义已经实现了，群众的生活水平应当提高，就用不着再提倡节约渡荒，更不应当叫群众搜集代食品。有些干部误以为关心灾民疾苦就是要单纯由政府出粮出钱“包养”起来。有些干部不深入下层去了解情况，只听一下汇报，就跟着别人叫喊，盲目夸大灾情，只管伸手向上级要钱要粮，而且口气越来越大。某些干部的这些思想，又助长了群众的依赖思想。这样，在救济款的发放上也发生了许多浪费现象。
    1956年的自然灾害特别严重，国家所拨的自然灾害救济款比过去任何一年都多。从全局来说，这是必要的，不可少的。但是，这并不等于说，分配到每一个地方，分配到每一个灾民，都是非常恰当的。有些地方所得救济款超过了实际需要，浪费救济款的现象也就严重。首先是没有严格执行专款专用的原则，把救济款挪作别用，甚至有用来买收音机、修建办公室。其次是平均分配，人人有份。这样，有的地方每人所得无几，不困难的户把款子乱花了，困难的户却还没有解决问题。有的地方大家都得到了一定数量的救济款，困难户可以渡荒，不困难的户就生活得更好，而国家的救济款就支出过多。无论哪种情况，都说明平均主义的分配办法是不正确的。不需要救济的人也给予救济，必然形成浪费；需要救济的人也有在得到救济款以后，马上大吃大喝，甚至用以赌博把它浪费掉的。这都是依赖思想和包养思想发展的必然结果。
    国家在社会主义建设时期，各项开支都在精打细算。能够抽出大批救济款来，是很不容易的。我们应当格外爱惜。救济款的数量总是有限的，它应当起到保障灾民生活、推动灾区生产的作用。能使灾民安全渡过灾荒的主要办法仍然是“生产自救，节约渡荒”。合作社比单干强并不表现在“没有粮食找仓库，没有金钱找银行”上面，而是表现在提高生产力、促进生产发展的事实上面。没有粮食，要从农业生产上找；没有现钱，要从副业生产上找。为了渡过灾荒，不仅靠节约，还要努力生产。灾区的生活水平，比平常年景低一些，这是难以避免的。掺和着吃一些代食品，也是必要的。最靠得住的是增产节约。如果大家专依靠政府，那末政府又靠谁呢？要想把灾区老百姓都包养起来，实际上也就是由丰收地区的人民把灾区人民养起来，这不但办不到，而且也不应当。
    1956年灾区在生产工作上总的说来做得还不错，但是不少灾区在节约方面做得就差了一些。现在春耕季节来到了，灾区在生产方面应当在已有的成绩上再提高一步。同时，应该赶紧把去年注意不够的节约问题强调起来，树立节约渡荒的风气，反对一切浪费现象，严格掌握救济款的使用，克服依赖政府救济的思想。当然，政府的必要的救济，还是不可少的。在春荒时期，仍应切实做好救济工作，使应当救济的人都能得到救济。总之，要使救济款全部真正能够起保障灾民生活、推动灾区生产的作用。
