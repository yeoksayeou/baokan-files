Farmers' Proverbs
There are no special tricks to farming; fertilizer is the key.
Choose good seeds and grow good seedlings; when planting rice, look at the seedlings; when marrying a daughter-in-law, look at the mother.
Weeding the rice three times ensures full granaries; hoeing the beans three times ensures round grains.
If people are as diligent as the land requires, gold will come from the hoe's blade.
Don't plant rice too early, and don't harvest rice too late.

    农谚
    作田无别巧，肥料就是宝。
    选好种，长好苗，栽禾看秧，娶亲看娘。
    禾耘三道仓仓满，豆锄三遍粒粒圆。
    人不认真地认真，锄头口上出黄金。
    栽禾莫在前，割禾莫在后。		    新兵搜集
