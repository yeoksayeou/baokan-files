Guiding Secondary and Primary School Graduates in Further Education and Employment
Meixian County, Guangdong, Establishes Special Committee

    (By Our Reporter) Meixian County, Guangdong, established the "Meixian County Secondary and Primary School Graduates Further Education and Labor Employment Guidance Committee" on the 6th of this month. This committee is responsible for leading ideological education for this year's secondary and primary school graduates and guiding them in further education and employment.

    The committee decided to actively strengthen ideological education for secondary and primary school graduates through various means. It will help students and parents understand the nature and purpose of secondary and primary school education, so that students who continue their education can study diligently, and those who cannot continue their education can happily and actively participate in labor production.

    The committee also plans to open handicraft training classes so that young people who cannot continue their education can quickly master skills and participate in production. In order to meet the demands of some overseas Chinese children who did not pass the entrance exams but urgently want to study, it is planned to appropriately open private supplementary schools or classes, and organize self-study groups.

    This committee is composed of leaders from relevant departments of the Meixian County Party, government, labor unions, Communist Youth League, women's federations, education, culture, industry, agriculture, and overseas Chinese affairs, as well as a small number of middle and primary school principals. Branches will be established in major townships (or towns) and middle schools.

    本报讯　广东梅县于本月6日成立了“梅县中、小学毕业生升学与劳动就业指导委员会”，负责领导对今年中、小学毕业生进行前途教育，并指导他们升学和就业。
    该会决定用各种方式，积极加强对中小学毕业生的思想教育，帮助学生和家长了解中、小学教育的性质和目的，使继续升学的学生能努力学习，不能升学的学生能愉快积极地参加劳动生产。
    该会还准备开设手工业训练班，以便使不能升学的青年能迅速掌握技术、参加生产。为了满足一些考不上学校而又迫切要求学习的华侨子女的要求，准备适当开办民办补习学校或补习班，并组织自学小组。
    这个委员会是由梅县党、政、工、团、妇女、教育、文化、工业、农业、侨务等有关部门的负责人，以及一小部分的中、小学校长组成的。各大乡（或镇）和中学将成立分会。
