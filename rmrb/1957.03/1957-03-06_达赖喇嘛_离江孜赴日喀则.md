Xinhua News Agency, Gyantse, 4th - After staying in Gyantse for eight days, the Dalai Lama and his entourage departed from here at 9:30 this morning for Shigatse.

When the Dalai Lama left Gyantse, Tibetan and Han staff members of various Gyantse agencies and organizations, as well as monks, nuns, and lay people from all walks of life in Gyantse, lined the roadsides in the suburbs to see him off.

During his stay in Gyantse, the Dalai Lama listened to reports on various tasks in the Gyantse area and gave instructions for future work. He particularly emphasized that Tibetan and Han cadres should unite closely, engage in criticism and self-criticism, and work together to carry out the construction work of Gyantse.

The Dalai Lama happily spent the Tibetan New Year in Gyantse.

In Gyantse, the Dalai Lama also carried out various religious activities. On February 25th, the Dalai Lama lectured to more than 10,000 monks, nuns, and lay people in the main hall of the Pelkor Chode Monastery in Gyantse. After finishing the lecture, the Dalai Lama spoke to the listeners, hoping that the monks, nuns, and lay people of Gyantse would strengthen unity and help each other. After that, the Dalai Lama visited more than a dozen temples of various sizes in Gyantse to worship Buddha, distribute alms, and meet with more than 30,000 lamas, nuns, and people from all walks of life, bestowing blessings on them.

Before the Dalai Lama left Gyantse, the Gyantse Sub-Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a banquet to see him and his entourage off.
