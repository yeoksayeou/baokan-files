    I watched the Czechoslovakian State Film Studio's puppet film "The Good Soldier Švejk" a few days ago, and I found it very interesting.
      "The Good Soldier Švejk" is adapted from the novel of the same name by the writer Hašek. The original book includes illustrations by Lada, which are truly a perfect combination of text and pictures. Precisely because of this, adapting it into a film is not an easy task.
    The audience's eyes are inherently critical, and if the audience is also a reader beforehand, then the demands of their eyes are even stricter. Adapting literary works into films is an extremely complex task. It requires condensing the people and events in the original work into a story that can be watched in less than two hours, recreating in a fleeting moment the scenery that was described in thousands of words, making characters who were meticulously described appear on the screen for only two seconds and still leaving a profound impression, and also striving for beautiful and pleasing picture composition, and so on. However, after watching the puppet film "The Good Soldier Švejk," I feel that it has extracted the essence of the original work appropriately. Even if the audience and the reader are the same person, they will not feel that the film contradicts the original work. The literary work and the puppet film each exhibit their own characteristics.
    The renowned children's painter Jiří Trnka is the director and screenwriter of this film, as well as the creator of all the character images in the film. Based on his valuable experience in children's drawing and his meticulous study of the original work, he appropriately utilized the modeling and performance characteristics of puppets to perfectly embody the spirit of the original work.
    If one compares the puppet film and the original work, one will find that they are not entirely consistent. For example, the dialogue between Švejk and Lieutenant Dub in the station when they see the military train loaded with the wreckage of their unit's aircraft, and the scene where the lieutenant climbs on top of the carriage to spy with binoculars on Švejk buying private liquor from a Jew, have been added or deleted in the film. However, this treatment not only does not detract from the original work but also highlights the authenticity of the original work and the characteristics of puppet theater, making the plot we see more lively and the entertainment value stronger.
    We can also see examples of this kind of re-creative approach that highlights the spirit of the original work in other interesting scenes. For example, when Švejk is earnestly talking about something that happened to someone in the past, a monochrome, single-line, flat animated cartoon appears on the screen. Because of the contrast of this flat, monotonous, and more exaggerated picture, the sense of reality of the puppet's activities is enhanced.
    In terms of character image creation, the film also left a deep impression on the audience. Every character, including the big-bearded police chief with the worst temper, has been transformed by the artist Trnka into a lovable toy with its own personality, making people fall in love with them before they even experience their performing arts, thus creating an atmosphere conducive to enhancing the dramatic effect. This makes us deeply feel how important the modeling of puppet characters is.
    Some time ago, when I was talking with a Czechoslovakian friend about the puppet film "The Good Soldier Švejk," he said that our "Journey to the West" is as popular as "The Good Soldier Švejk," and asked me why I didn't suggest to the filmmakers that it also be filmed chapter by chapter like the puppet film "The Good Soldier Švejk," and told me how timely and economical this method is. I very much agree with this idea, and I think we do lack interesting films like "The Good Soldier Švejk." (Attached picture)

　　木偶片“好兵帅克”

    前几天，看了捷克斯洛伐克国家制片厂出品的木偶片“好兵帅克”，觉得非常有趣。
      “好兵帅克”是根据作家哈谢克的同名小说改编的。原书中附有拉达的插画，真是图文并茂。正因为如此，要把它改编拍成电影，是很不容易的事。
    观众的眼睛本来就是很严格的，如果观众事先又是一位读者的话，那眼睛的要求就更严格了。把文学作品改编为电影，那是十分复杂的工作。要把原作中的人和事压缩为不到两小时即可看完的故事，要把用几千字描写过的风景再现于一刹那，要使曾经细致地描写过的人物只在银幕上出现两秒钟，并且能给人十分深刻的印象，此外还需力求画面构图的美丽、好看等等。但是看过木偶片“好兵帅克”以后，觉得它对原著提炼得很合适。观众和读者虽同是一个人，也不会觉得这部影片与原作有什么矛盾。文学作品和木偶片显出了各自的特色。
    著名的儿童画家伊尔齐·特仑卡是这部影片的编导，同时也是片中所有角色形象的塑造者。他根据自己在儿童绘画上的可贵经验和对原著的精密研究结果，适当地运用了木偶的造型和表演上的特性，完美地把原著精神体现了出来。
    假若把木偶片和原著互相对照，便会发现二者是不尽符合的。如帅克和杜勃少尉在车站上看到满载着自己部队的飞机残骸的军用列车时的对话，少尉爬在车厢顶上用望远镜窥查帅克向犹太人购买私酒的场面等，影片中都有所增删。但这样处理不但无损于原作，而且凸现了原作的真实和木偶戏剧的特点，使我们看到的情节更活了，娱快性更强了。
    这种以再创造的手法，突出了原著精神的例子，我们还可以在另一些有趣的场面上看到。比如，帅克正在煞有介事地谈到过去一个什么人的什么事的时候，画面上就出现了一幅单色单线的、平面的活动卡通来。由于这种平面单调的较为夸张的画面的衬托，就加强了木偶活动的真实感。
    在角色形象的塑造上，影片也给观众留下了深刻的印象。每一个角色，包括脾气最坏的大胡子警察局长在内，在艺术家特仑卡的创造下，都变成一个个具有个性的可爱的玩具，使人在未接触到他们的表演艺术之前，就爱上了他们，因而产生了一种有利于加强戏剧效果的气氛。这使我们深深地感到，木偶角色的造型有多么重要的地位。
    前些日子，和一位捷克斯洛伐克朋友谈起木偶片“好兵帅克”时，他说我们的“西游记”也同“好兵帅克”一样受欢迎，问我为什么不向制片家建议，把它也像木偶片“好兵帅克”那样一章一回地拍出来，并且告诉我这种办法是多么及时而又经济。我十分赞同这个意见，我觉得我们的确缺少像“好兵帅克”这样有趣的电影。（附图片）
