Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd - According to incomplete statistics, state-owned and joint state-private factories in Beijing plan to trial produce more than 470 new product varieties this year.

The trial production of many new products signifies the improvement of production technology in Beijing's local industry. A type of ultraviolet arc carbon rods specifically for blueprinting, which China could not produce in the past and relied on imports, has now been successfully trial produced using domestic raw materials and is preparing for small-scale production. Beijing's local industrial factories will also trial produce and manufacture welding rod steel, spring steel, ball bearing steel, magnetic steel, and borax, all of which are needed by Beijing's industry, this year. Following the successful trial production of the Zorki-type small camera last year, the Dalai Camera Factory will trial produce a reflex camera this year.

When determining which new products to trial produce, the factories concerned conducted investigations and research. Given the shortage of scientific instruments and medical equipment, the Teaching Instrument Factory and the United Instrument Factory will trial produce and manufacture twelve new product varieties this year, including student balances, demonstration meter sticks, weight sets, blueprinting mirrors, and pocket theodolites. Medical equipment factories will also add new products such as vascular sutures and ophthalmic electromagnets. After extensively soliciting opinions from consumers, the Beijing No. 3 Local Industry Bureau will manufacture dual-purpose stoves this year that can be used for cooking at ordinary times and for heating in winter, and which can also reduce coal consumption.

Many factories also paid attention to trial producing new products that both meet needs and save raw materials. Beijing No. 1 Dyeing and Weaving Factory mixes wool, nylon, and rayon to weave "Full Ni," suitable for women's skirts, and "Oriental Ni" woven from rayon, which is like woolen "valentin." These products are of good quality and low price, and can replace cotton textiles, saving cotton yarn. The five new styles of women's autumn shirts produced by the knitting factory are attractive in style and bright in color, and are currently being trial-sold and are very popular with consumers. These new product varieties use one kilogram less cotton yarn per dozen than ordinary women's round-neck shirts. The Motor Factory will trial produce distribution boxes made of cement asbestos board, which will save the entire factory 182 tons of steel plate this year. The Hongxing Iron Factory plans to produce water-tube boilers this year, which will save the entire factory 400 tons of steel plate this year.

　　北京地方工业将试制新产品四百多种
    新华社23日讯　据不完全统计，北京市地方国营、公私合营工厂今年计划试制四百七十多种新品种产品。
    许多新产品的试制标志着北京市地方工业生产技术水平的提高。一种专供晒图用的紫外线弧光炭精，过去我国不能生产，一向依靠进口，现在已经用国产原料试制成功，正准备小批生产。北京市工业需要的焊条钢、弹簧钢、滚珠轴承钢、磁钢和硼砂等，今年也都要由北京市地方工业工厂试制、生产。大来照像机厂继去年试制成功卓尔基式小型照像机以后，今年又将试制反光镜照像机。
    在确定试制新品种产品的时候，有关的工厂都进行了调查研究。根据科学仪器、医疗器械缺少的情况，教学仪器厂、联合仪器厂今年将试制和生产学生天平、演示米尺、法码组、晒图镜、袖珍经纬仪等十二种新品种产品。医疗器械工厂也将增加血管缝合器、眼科电磁铁等新产品。北京市第三地方工业局在广泛征求了消费者的意见以后，今年将制造平时可以做饭，冬天又可以取暖，并且能够减少用煤的两用火炉。
    许多工厂还注意到试制既符合需要又节约原材料的新产品。北京市染织一厂用羊毛、尼龙和人造纤维混织成适合妇女做裙子的富尔呢，以及用人造纤维织成的东方呢，就像毛织品凡尔丁一样，这些产品物美价廉，又可以代替棉纺织品，节约棉纱。针织厂生产的五种新式样的女式春秋衫，式样好看，颜色鲜艳，现在正在试销，很受消费者欢迎，这种新品种产品比起一般女式圆领衫每打少用一公斤棉纱。电机厂将试制水泥石棉板的配电箱，全厂今年可以节约一百八十二吨钢板。洪兴铁工厂今年计划生产的水管式锅炉，全厂今年可以节省四百吨钢板。
