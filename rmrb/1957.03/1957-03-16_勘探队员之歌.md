    Song of the Prospectors
    Luo Zhiqin
    I live beneath Yanshan Mountain, Yanshan is my screen;
    In the green-leaf tent is a white awning, under the awning is my home.
    In the morning I hear the mountain sparrows sing, the stream tinkles;
    I carry my axe and hammer and walk into the deep valley, searching for treasures in the valley...
    On the map are spots and dots, on the earth mountains soar;
    The mountain peaks pierce the white clouds, countless heroes are among the clouds.
    The clouds are high, but the heroes' hearts are even higher;
    In mid-air the songs echo, on the cloud tops red flags flutter...
    Opening the mountain's chest, revealing the treasures within;
    The treasures coquette with me: "How long have we been waiting for you to arrive!"
    The mountain wind is cheering, the wildflowers laugh and bend over,
    The mountain stream is playing the zither, on the barren mountain, everywhere is joy...

    勘探队员之歌
    骆志勤一我住燕山下，燕山是屏架；绿叶帐中有白篷，篷里是我家。朝听山雀唱，溪水响叮当；手提斧锤走深谷，谷里觅宝藏……二地图上斑斑点点，地球上山岳冲天；山尖戳破了白云，无数英雄在云间。云高山还高，英雄心更高；半空里歌声回荡，云端里红旗飘飘……三打开山的胸，亮出山中宝；宝对我撒娇：“多久啦，你们才来到！”山风在欢叫，野花笑倒腰，涧水弹着琴，荒山上，到处是欢跃……
