Talking about Socialist Transformation and Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
Li Yuji's Speech

I warmly support Premier Zhou Enlai's "Report on Visits to Eleven Asian and European Countries," Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Explanation on Several Issues Concerning the Proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan," and agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report. I am most excited and unforgettable to have heard Chairman Mao's cordial teachings at the Supreme State Conference, and I have received profound education and inspiration.

On Socialist Transformation

The contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class has been transformed into a non-antagonistic contradiction, but the dual nature still exists.

Now I would like to talk about the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

Chairman Mao has made a correct assessment of the social status of national industrialists and businessmen in the country's life. The antagonistic contradiction has been transformed into a non-antagonistic contradiction, and the dual nature still exists. Industrialists and businessmen still have the task of learning and transforming themselves. The contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class is theoretically generally antagonistic. However, under specific historical conditions in China, due to the correct policies and measures adopted by the Chinese Communist Party for the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, the transformation of antagonism into non-antagonism became possible. National industrialists and businessmen initially sympathized with the revolution and participated in the revolution, and later supported the Common Program and the Constitution, expressing their willingness to give up private ownership and take the socialist road under the leadership of the working class through gradual transformation. This clearly shows that under the leadership and education of the Chinese Communist Party, national industrialists and businessmen have realized that exploitation is shameful and understand the laws of social development. Therefore, they are willing to give up exploitation and do not want to stand on the opposite side of the working class anymore. They are also willing to accept transformation and gradually shift to the side of the working class to work together for building socialism. Facts over the past few years have proved that the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen are sincerely accepting transformation. They abide by policies and participate in a series of social reform movements and patriotic movements. They acknowledge that the "Five-Anti" movement was a profound education that was beneficial to their transformation. At the beginning of 1956, on the basis of ideological maturity and the fulfillment of conditions, the entire industry was jointly operated by public and private sectors with gongs and drums, and they voluntarily handed over the power to control and use the means of production to the state. After the joint public-private operation, they conscientiously studied policies and theories, and together with the workers and staff, actively participated in the socialist labor emulation drive to strive for meritorious service. We must see that national industrialists and businessmen have undergone such a series of changes, and see that they are advancing firmly and confidently in the process of transforming from exploiters to laborers. Of course, private ownership has not been finally eliminated, and capitalist ideology and style of work have not been completely eradicated. Therefore, contradictions still exist, but antagonism has been transformed into non-antagonism. Antagonism has been eliminated, and contradictions exist. Therefore, if we do not understand the problem based on the results of social practice and still believe that there is still an antagonistic contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class, this not only does not conform to objective reality, not only makes industrialists and businessmen lose confidence in accepting transformation and affects the exertion of their enthusiasm, but also means that the Chinese national bourgeoisie has no possibility of transformation, which is also theoretically unfounded.

Some people also believe that industrialists and businessmen no longer have a dual nature, because after the joint public-private operation, it is no longer possible for industrialists and businessmen to use the means of production to exploit the working class, or to engage in speculation and profiteering to disrupt the social economic order. I think this view is not comprehensive and does not conform to the facts. The existence of the dual nature of industrialists and businessmen runs through the entire transformation process, but it has different content and different forms of expression at different stages, because things are constantly developing and changing. In the past stages, the content and forms of expression of the dual nature have been analyzed in detail and clearly in the political report made by Chairman Liu Shaoqi at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. After the joint public-private operation, the content and forms of expression of the dual nature of industrialists and businessmen have changed again, with the positive aspects constantly expanding and the negative aspects constantly shrinking, and the positive aspects have become the main aspect. The positive aspects are mainly manifested in: conscientiously studying national policies, Marxist-Leninist theories, and the technical and business knowledge of socialist production and management; striving for self-transformation, establishing labor viewpoints, and changing ideological styles; actively participating in socialist competition movements, patriotic movements, and social activities, and contributing their technical expertise and business experience, etc. All of these are beneficial to socialism. We are very pleased to see that this is the basic situation of current industrialists and businessmen. The negative aspects are mainly manifested in: some cannot consciously perform their duties and responsibilities, holding an attitude of muddling through and seeking to avoid mistakes; some cannot actively and proactively manage the relationship between public and private affairs; some even embezzle public funds and misappropriate raw materials for personal gain, etc. All of these are concrete manifestations of the bourgeois selfish and profit-seeking ideology under new conditions, and are detrimental to socialism. However, it must be seen that these situations are after all a minority, and are constantly decreasing through explanation and education.

Some people also believe that fixed interest is not negative and has nothing to do with the dual nature. I think this general statement is not appropriate. We should understand what the essence of fixed interest is and why the state promotes the fixed interest method as two separate issues. The source of fixed interest is the wealth created by the working people. Taking fixed interest is, after all, an act of exploitation. Therefore, in terms of the essence of fixed interest, it is a negative thing. However, the state promotes the fixed interest method so that industrialists and businessmen do not feel sudden changes in the transformation process, and their lives are not affected, so that they can settle down, actively contribute their talents, serve socialism, and strive for self-transformation. Therefore, the policy measure of promoting the fixed interest method is conducive to the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and is also conducive to socialism. Therefore, on the one hand, we say that the fixed interest method is good, but on the other hand, we must give up the fixed interest at an appropriate time. Therefore, I believe that the essence of fixed interest is negative, but the fixed interest method is beneficial to socialism; fixed interest is a negative thing, but following the policy to take fixed interest and use it reasonably cannot be said to be a manifestation of the negative aspect.

The negative aspects of industrialists and businessmen are constantly shrinking, but this does not mean that they have been eliminated. Therefore, denying that the dual nature still exists will paralyze the thinking of industrialists and businessmen and relax self-transformation. Obviously, this does not conform to the desire of industrialists and businessmen to make progress, nor does it conform to the state's policy on the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

On Increasing Production and Practicing Economy

Think big, start small; only by saving can we increase production, and only by increasing production can we save; only by establishing a style of hard work and simplicity can we achieve results in increasing production and practicing economy; three issues that should be paid attention to in the movement.

I would like to express some more opinions on the issue of increasing production and practicing economy.

Increasing production and practicing economy is the issue of using materials to achieve a greater degree of effect, and it is the issue of rationally using material resources, financial resources, and human resources. This issue is one of the important measures to overcome the main contradictions in our country. Therefore, it is entirely timely and necessary to call on the people of the whole country to launch a huge movement to increase production and practice economy. Launching increased production and practicing economy seems easy, but it is actually a long-term, complex, and arduous struggle. We must think big and start small. Thinking big means making various plans accurate, reasonable, and feasible; starting small means starting from picking up a grain of sesame. People often say don't pick up sesame and forget watermelon. I think we want watermelon, but we still want sesame. Secondly, we must mobilize comprehensively and deeply, and be able to persevere.

Increasing production and practicing economy are two aspects of one problem. We cannot treat increasing production and practicing economy as two separate things. Only by saving can we increase production, and only by increasing production can we save; conversely, without increasing production, there is no talk of saving, and without saving, there is no talk of increasing production. For example, if the planned output of yarn in national textile mills in 1957 is five million pieces, and if each piece of yarn can save one catty of cotton, about 13,000 more pieces of cotton yarn can be produced, which can weave about 500,000 bolts of cloth, which can be used to make clothes for about 3.5 million people. These raw cotton are equivalent to farmers planting 50,000 more mu of cotton (calculated at 100 catties of ginned cotton per mu). For example, if the 600 million people in the country save one liang of rice per month, they can save 450 million catties of rice throughout the year, which can be used for one million people to eat for one year. This grain is equivalent to farmers planting 900,000 more mu of rice fields. Therefore, increasing production is a positive approach, and saving is not negative, but also a positive approach.

I think that to carry out increased production and practicing economy well, we must first do a good job in the ideological education of the masses. Some people often cover up extravagance and waste by saying "be more ambitious," some people criticize thrift and savings as "small-handed and small-footed," and still others are not accustomed to cherishing public property. In production, they think that individual efforts cannot play a role, and in affairs, they think that small waste has little impact. All these ideological awarenesses are obstacles to carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy, and should be criticized. China has many good ancient proverbs, such as don't "waste natural resources," "think of the difficulty of coming by every bowl of porridge and rice," "many a little makes a mickle," etc. These ancient proverbs are very meaningful and should be explained and promoted to the masses. Only by establishing a style of hard work and simplicity among the masses can we achieve results in increasing production and practicing economy.

Before the Hankou Shenxin Yarn Factory first launched the movement to increase production and practice economy in the second half of 1952, it checked the waste of the past three years, which amounted to 600,000 yuan. After exposing the waste phenomenon in various aspects, all the workers in the factory realized that even if someone inadvertently stepped on a cotton flower or dropped a nail, it would cause great waste. After in-depth discussions among the masses, various departments formulated targets for increasing production and practicing economy and earnestly implemented them. In 1953, 5,000 new spindles were purchased, and one-third of the price came from savings. After the joint public-private operation in 1954, under the leadership of the public side, the work of increasing production and practicing economy has always been closely grasped. Thanks to the joint efforts of the workers, the results are good. Compared with 1953, the production cost in 1956 decreased by 24.96%, the labor cost decreased by 41.60%, and the profit increased accordingly, increasing by 786.98%. The total output value completed the first Five-Year Plan one year and one month ahead of schedule, and the total output completed the first Five-Year Plan one year, three months, and thirteen and a half days ahead of schedule. This fully shows that joint ventures are far superior to private enterprises, and increased production and practicing economy have also achieved greater results. However, there are still many wasteful phenomena, especially in the past, we only paid attention to saving on material resources and financial resources, and did not pay attention to saving on human resources. Now, the number of employees directly participating in production accounts for about 80% of the total number of employees, and the number of employees in administrative affairs has increased by more than three times compared with before the joint public-private operation, but the administrative affairs are busy and chaotic, and various departments still feel that there are not enough people. This phenomenon is caused by "three more": more meetings, more reports, and more procedures. I think that in addition to saving financial resources and material resources, saving human resources is also very important. In the future, we should pay attention to the rational use of human resources.

The following three issues, I think, are worth considering in carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy.

First, the issue of eating: There is a traditional custom in our country that parents always want their children to eat more, and they always express their concern to friends by "trying to add meals." In fact, it is best to determine three meals a day according to the labor intensity and physical needs of each person. Excessive diet is not only wasteful, but also harmful to the body. We should widely publicize to the people and reverse this seemingly good but not good custom.

Second, the issue of housing: Now there is a housing shortage everywhere. In fact, many houses are not used rationally. We should vigorously carry out adjustment work. Many agencies and enterprises have built large auditoriums and clubs, which are used at a very low rate, and should be used more. There are also many agencies and enterprises that have built floodlit ballrooms, which are used even less, forming a waste.

Third, the issue of children dropping out of school: Now there are many children who cannot go to school, which is a serious problem. Is it possible to organize unemployed intellectuals, students who cannot go to middle school and university, and educated housewives to widely establish study classes in cities and villages, adopting the form of private schools in the past, appropriately improving them, without the need for all courses to be fully prepared, and arranging courses according to the specific situation of the teachers, under the leadership of educational institutions, handled by residents' committees in cities and by village heads or cooperatives in villages. In this way, at least children can have the opportunity to learn culture, and at the same time, it can also solve the living problems of some unemployed people.

The above opinions are not very comprehensive, please criticize and correct them.

    谈社会主义改造和增产节约问题
    厉旡咎的发言
    我热烈拥护周恩来总理“关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告”，李富春副总理“关于第二个五年计划建议的若干问题的说明”，同意陈叔通副主席的工作报告。我感到最兴奋难忘的是在最高国务会议上听到毛主席的亲切教导，受到了深刻的教育和启发。
    关于社会主义改造
    资产阶级同工人阶级间的矛盾已转为非对抗性的矛盾，但两面性还存在。
    现在我想谈谈资本主义改造问题。
    毛主席对当前民族工商业者在国家生活中所处的社会地位作了正确的估价。对抗性矛盾已转为非对抗性矛盾，两面性还存在，工商业者还有学习、改造的任务。资产阶级同工人阶级之间的矛盾，从理论上一般性来说是对抗性的。但中国民族工商业者在特定的历史条件下，由于中国共产党对资改造工作采取了正确的政策和措施，对抗性转变为非对抗性就有实现可能。民族工商业者由初期的同情革命、参加革命，后来又拥护共同纲领、拥护宪法，表示愿意在工人阶级领导下，通过逐步改造，放弃私有制，走社会主义道路。这很明显地说明，民族工商业者在中国共产党领导教育下，已认识到剥削可耻，懂得社会发展规律，因而愿意放弃剥削，不愿意再站在工人阶级的敌对方面，而且愿意接受改造，逐步地转变到工人阶级这一方面来，共同为建设社会主义而努力。几年来的事实证明，绝大多数的工商业者是诚心诚意地接受改造的。他们服从政策，参加一系列的社会改革运动、爱国运动。他们承认“五反”运动是有利于他们改造的一次深刻的教育。1956年年初，在思想成熟、条件具备的基础上敲锣打鼓地实行全行业公私合营，自愿将生产资料的支配权和运用权交给了国家。公私合营后，他们又认真学习政策和理论，并和职工群众一道，积极投入社会主义劳动竞赛，争取立功。我们必须看到民族工商业者已经发生了这样一系列的变化，看到他们坚定而有信心地正在由剥削者转变为劳动者的过程中迈步前进。当然，私有制还没有最后取消，资本主义思想作风还没有完全清除，因而矛盾还是存在的，只是对抗性已转变为非对抗性，对抗消灭了，矛盾存在着。因此，如果不根据社会实践的结果来认识问题，仍然认为当前民族资产阶级同工人阶级之间还存在着对抗性矛盾，这不仅不符合客观实际，不仅使工商业者对接受改造丧失信心，影响他们积极性的发挥，而且意味着中国民族资产阶级没有改造的可能性，这在理论上也是没有根据的。
    也有少数人认为当前工商业者已经没有两面性了，理由是公私合营后，工商业者已不可能再利用生产资料向工人阶级进行剥削，或者进行投机倒把扰乱社会经济秩序了。我认为这样看法是不全面的，也不符合事实的。工商业者两面性的存在是与整个改造过程相始终的，只是在不同的阶段具有不同的内容和不同的表现形式，因为事物是在不断发展变化着的。在过去各个阶段中两面性的内容和表现形式，刘少奇委员长在中共“八大”会议上所作的政治报告中已有详细明确的分析。公私合营后，工商业者两面性的内容和表现形式又起了变化，积极面在不断扩大，消极面在不断缩小，积极面已成了主要的一面。积极面主要表现在：认真学习国家政策、马列主义理论和社会主义生产经营的技术业务知识；努力自我改造，建立劳动观点，改变思想作风；积极参加社会主义竞赛运动、爱国运动和社会活动，贡献自己的技术专长和业务经验等等。所有这些都是有利于社会主义的，我们很高兴地看到，这已是当前工商业者的基本情况。消极面主要表现在：有的不能自觉地守职尽责，抱着得过且过、但求无过的态度；有的不能主动积极地搞好公私共事关系；有的甚至假公济私、挪用公款、盗用原材料等等。所有这些都是资产阶级自私自利的思想意识在新的条件下的具体表现，都是不利于社会主义的。但是，必须看到这些情况毕竟是少数，而且通过说明教育，正在不断减少。
    也有少数人认为定息不是消极的，与两面性没有关系。我认为这样笼统的说法是不恰当的，应该把定息的实质是什么和国家为什么要推行定息办法作为两个问题来认识。定息的来源，是劳动人民所创造的财富，拿定息毕竟是一种剥削行为，因此就定息本质来说是消极的东西。但是国家推行定息办法，使工商业者在改造过程中不致感到突然的变革，生活亦不致发生影响，以便安下心来，积极贡献才能，为社会主义服务，并努力自我改造。因此推行定息办法这一政策措施，是有利于对资改造，也有利于社会主义的。所以我们一方面说定息办法是好的，但另一方面又要在适当时机放弃定息。因此我认为，定息的本质是消极的，但定息办法是有利于社会主义的；定息是消极的东西，但遵照政策拿定息并合理地使用定息，不能说是消极面的表现。
    工商业者的消极面正在不断缩小，但不等于已经消灭了。因此否认两面性还存在，将麻痹工商业者的思想，放松自我改造，显然这是不符合工商业者要求进步的愿望的，也不符合国家对资改造政策的。
    关于增产节约
    要从大处着想，小处入手；能节约才能增产，能增产才能节约；只有树立了艰苦朴素的风气，增产节约才能获得成绩；运动中应注意的三个问题。
    我再想就增产节约问题发表一些意见。
    增产节约是如何使用物资取得更大程度的效果的问题，是合理使用物力、财力和人力的问题。这个问题是克服我国当前主要矛盾的重要措施之一，因此号召全国人民开展一个巨大的增产节约运动是完全及时而必要的。开展增产节约，看来容易，实际是一个长期的复杂而又艰巨的斗争。要从大处着想，小处入手。大处着想，要把各种计划搞得精确、合理、可行；小处入手，要从捡一粒芝麻开始。常有人说不要捡了芝麻忘了西瓜，我认为西瓜要，芝麻还是要。其次要动员得全面、深入，要能坚持不懈。
    增产节约是一个问题的两个方面，不能把增产和节约作为两件事情分开来看待。能节约才能增产，能增产才能节约；反之，不能增产就谈不上节约，不能节约也谈不上增产。例如全国纱厂57年计划产量五百万件，每件纱如能节约用棉一斤，就可多产棉纱约一万三千件，约可织布五十万匹，约可供三百五十万人每人做一身衣服。这些原棉，约等于农民多种五万亩棉花（以每亩产皮棉一百斤算）。又如全国六亿人民，每人每月节约大米一两，全年可节省大米四亿五千万斤，约可供一百万人一年的食用。这些粮食，约等于农民多种九十万亩稻田。所以增产是积极作法，节约也不是消极的，也是积极作法。
    我认为，要增产节约开展得好，首先要作好群众的思想教育工作。有些人常以“气魄要大些”来掩盖铺张浪费，有些人批评俭朴节省为“小手小脚”，更有些人不习惯于爱护公共物资。在生产上认为个人努力起不了作用，在事务上认为小有浪费影响不大。所有这些思想意识，都是开展增产节约运动的障碍，应加批判。中国有许多好的古谚，如不要“暴殄天物”，“一粥一饭当思来处不易”，“集腋成裘积沙成塔”等等。这些古谚，很有意义，应多向群众讲解宣传。只有在群众中树立了艰苦朴素的风气，增产节约才能获得成绩。
    汉口申新纱厂在1952年下半年初次开展增产节约运动前，检查过去三年的浪费达六十万元。将各方面的浪费现象揭发后，全厂职工认识到任何一人即使不经意地踩一朵棉花，丢一个钉子，都是造成很大浪费的因素。通过群众深入讨论后，各部门制定了增产节约指标，切实执行。53年添购五千枚新锭，价款的三分之一，即是由节约而来的。54年公私合营后，在公方领导下，对增产节约一贯抓得很紧。由于职工群众的共同努力，成绩是好的，56年和53年比较，生产成本降低24.96％，工费成本降低41.60％，利润则相应提高，增加了786.98％。总产值已提前一年一个月完成了第一个五年计划，总产量提前一年三个月又十三天半完成了第一个五年计划。这充分说明合营企业大大优越于私营企业，增产节约也取得了更大的成绩。但是浪费现象还存在很多，特别是过去只注意在物力、财力上节约，没有注意人力的节约。现在直接参加生产的职工约为职工总数的80％，事务方面的职工比公私合营前增加约三倍多，而事务忙乱，各部门还感到人手不足。造成这种现象，由于“三多”：开会多，表报多，手续多。我认为节约财力、物力之外，节约人力也是十分重要的，今后我们要注意到人力的合理使用。
    以下三个问题，我认为在开展增产节约运动中值得考虑。
    第一，吃饭问题：我国有一种传统风气，父母总要子女多吃饭，对朋友总以“努力加餐”来表示关怀。其实一日三餐，最好依照各人的劳动强度和体质需要而定，过量的饮食，不但浪费，于身体反有害处。应该向人民广泛宣传，扭转这种似好而不好的风气。
    第二，房屋问题：现在各地都闹房荒，事实上有许多房屋没有合理使用，应该大力进行调整工作。有许多机关、企业，都修建大礼堂和俱乐部，使用率很低，应该多加利用。还有许多机关、企业，修建了灯光球场，利用率更少，形成浪费。
    第三，儿童失学问题：现在有很多儿童不能入学，是个严重问题。可否组织失业的知识分子、不能升中学、大学的学生以及有文化的家庭妇女，在城市和乡村，广泛成立学习班，采取过去的私塾形式，适当改进，不必各门课程全备，可根据师资具体情况布置课程，在教育机构领导下，城市由居民委员会办理，乡村由村长或合作社办理。这样至少可使儿童有学习文化的机会，同时亦可解决一部分失业人员的生活问题。
    以上意见，考虑得很不全面，请各位委员批评指正。
