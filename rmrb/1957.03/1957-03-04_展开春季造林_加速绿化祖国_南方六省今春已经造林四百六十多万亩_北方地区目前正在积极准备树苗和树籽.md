    Expand Spring Afforestation and Accelerate the Greening of the Motherland
    Southern Six Provinces Have Already Afforested More Than 4.6 Million Mu This Spring; Northern Regions Are Currently Actively Preparing Seedlings and Tree Seeds
    This newspaper reports that the spring afforestation campaign has successively begun in various southern provinces. According to materials from the Ministry of Forestry: As of recently, Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangxi six provinces have afforested more than 4.61 million mu this spring. Northern regions are also actively preparing seedlings and tree seeds to welcome the spring afforestation campaign that is about to begin.
    Guangdong Province has currently completed 1.86 million mu of spring afforestation. Gaoyao, Xinhui, Zijin, and other counties with faster progress in afforestation work have completed 70% to 80% of the annual afforestation tasks. Most townships and cooperatives in Gaoyao County, in order to improve the quality of afforestation, proposed the methods of "fixed quality, fixed quantity, fixed time, fixed work points" and "guaranteed planting, guaranteed survival, and guaranteed nurturing," so the afforestation specifications basically meet the requirements of technical regulations.
    Hunan Province has prepared 1.37 million mu of forest land for afforestation. The first batch of 53 counties and 1,376 agricultural cooperatives that are afforesting have already afforested 115,000 mu. These counties have mostly promoted the experience of Huatong County in preparing land for afforestation and combining grain and forestry. In Ningxiang County, Hunan, 753 agricultural cooperatives, in order to ensure the quality of afforestation, mostly organized afforestation professional teams and convened afforestation veteran farmer meetings. The county's afforestation area has exceeded the original plan by 74%, and the survival rate of seedlings is generally above 80%.
    Guangxi Province plans to afforest 6 million mu this year. Each special zone has made unified arrangements for afforestation tasks in rural work. Each county has universally held afforestation mobilization meetings, determined that the county party committee is responsible for arranging labor, and the forestry department is responsible for technical guidance, to achieve "guaranteed planting, guaranteed survival." Afforestation work also implements "designated area responsibility," with agricultural cooperatives supplying seedlings and members completing tasks on schedule. Labor points are recorded for members participating in afforestation, and they will be uniformly paid and uniformly distributed dividends by the cooperative in the future. In order to stimulate the enthusiasm of young people for afforestation, the Silian District of Xincheng County has formulated reasonable remuneration based on specific conditions in each township. For example, when Longgong Cooperative started afforestation, it stipulated that one person digging pits and planting 100 trees a day would be given ten work points. After stipulating this payment standard, the original plan was for one person to plant 100 trees a day, but as a result, one person planted 120 to 140 trees a day.
    Fujian Province strives to basically complete the spring afforestation task in early March. Farmers in many areas are planting trees and afforesting despite the spring cold and rain. As of February 19, the province had already afforested more than 366,000 mu. This year, because agricultural cooperatives in various places paid attention to arranging labor and delineating afforestation time, and at the same time implemented the principle of "unified work recording and unified division of labor," the afforestation work has been carried out better and faster. In Longxi Special Zone, which has a faster rate of afforestation, 174,000 mu were afforested in the ten days after the Beginning of Spring, accounting for 49% of the spring afforestation task. Large-scale afforestation is being carried out along the Minjiang River this spring. Technical cadres and workers from the state-owned Baisha Forest Farm and more than 600 members of nearby agricultural cooperatives started early in building continuous timber forests in Baisha Town, Minhou, in the lower reaches of the Minjiang River, and planted 1.5 million seedlings as early as January 25.
    As the weather warms and ice and snow gradually melt in northern regions, seedlings and tree seeds are currently being actively prepared. Henan Province plans to afforest 3.6 million mu this year. Each special zone has held forestry meetings to deploy spring afforestation work. Nanyang Special Zone has urgently notified counties to seize the soil moisture after the snow and prepare for seedlings, labor organization, and forest area division, and to launch a mass afforestation campaign recently. The Henan Provincial Department of Forestry has dispatched a large number of cadres to help with afforestation work in counties with larger tasks such as Luoyang and Xinyang. In addition to universally holding forestry meetings, Shandong Province has also trained a large number of foresters to help cooperatives formulate forestry production plans, and some townships and cooperatives have begun spring afforestation activities.

    展开春季造林  加速绿化祖国
    南方六省今春已经造林四百六十多万亩  北方地区目前正在积极准备树苗和树籽
    本报讯  春季造林运动已经在南方各省陆续开始。据林业部材料：广东、湖南、湖北、江西、福建、广西六省截至最近为止，今春已经造林四百六十一万多亩。北方各地也在积极准备树苗、树籽，迎接即将开始的春季造林运动。
    广东省目前已完成春季造林一百八十六万亩。造林工作进展较快的高要、新会、紫金等县已完成全年造林任务的70％到80％。高要县绝大部分乡、社为了提高造林质量，提出“定质、定量、定时、定工分”和“包栽、包活、包抚育”的办法，因而造林规格基本上符合技术规程的要求。
    湖南省为造林准备好的林地面积有一百三十七万亩，第一批造林的五十三个县一千三百七十六个农业社已经造林十一万五千亩。这些县大都推广了会同县整地造林、粮林结合造林的经验。湖南宁乡县的七百五十三个农业社，为了保证造林质量，大部分组织了造林专业队和召开了造林老农会。全县造林面积已经超过原定计划的74％，树苗的成活率一般在80％以上。
    广西省今年计划造林六百万亩。各专区都将造林任务在农村工作中作了统一安排。各县普遍召开了造林动员大会，确定由县委负责安排劳动力，林业部门负责技术指导，做到“包栽、包活”。造林工作还实行“划片包干”，由农业社供给苗木，社员按期完成任务。社员参加造林的劳动评记工分，将来由社统一计酬和统一分红。忻城县思练区为激发青年群众造林的积极性，各乡根据具体情况，订出合理报酬。如龙贡社在开始造林时，就规定一天一人挖坑并种一百株树，给工分十分。这样规定付酬标准后，原计划一人一天种树一百株，结果一人一天种下一百二十至一百四十株。
    福建省争取在3月上旬基本上完成春季造林任务。许多地区的农民正冒着春寒春雨植树造林。到2月19日，全省已经造林三十六万六千多亩。今年由于各地农业合作社注意安排劳动和划出造林时间，同时贯彻了“统一记工、统一分工”的原则，所以造林工作开展得较好较快。造林进度较快的龙溪专区，立春后的十天中就造林十七万四千多亩，占春季造林任务的49％。闽江沿岸今春进行大面积造林。国营白沙林场的技术干部、工人和邻近的农业社的六百多个社员，提早在闽江下游闽侯白沙镇营造连片的用材林，早在1月25日，就种下树苗一百五十万株。
    北方各地气候转暖，冰雪逐渐融化，目前正积极准备苗木、树籽。河南省今年计划造林三百六十万亩，各专区都已召开了林业会议，布置春季造林工作。南阳专区已紧急通知各县抓紧雪后墒情，作好苗木、劳力组织、林地区划等准备工作，要在最近掀起群众性的造林运动。河南省林业厅已派出大批干部分别到洛阳、信阳等任务较大的县帮助造林工作。山东省各地除普遍召开林业会议外，还训练大批林业员，帮助合作社制定林业生产计划，部分乡、社已开始春季造林活动。（附图片）
