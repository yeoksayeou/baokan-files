Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, March 5th: The China Pavilion at the 1957 Leipzig Spring International Fair, along with more than fifty exhibition halls from thirty-nine other countries, officially opened to visitors from over fifty countries. As in previous years, the China Pavilion is one of the most popular exhibition halls.

This is China's seventh participation in the Leipzig International Fair. This year, the China Pavilion presents 4,200 exhibits, an 88% increase compared to last year. A significant portion of the exhibits are new products from the past year.

Of particular interest to visitors are the heavy industrial products, with an exhibition area accounting for 45% of the total pavilion area (5,000 square meters). This is unprecedented in previous exhibitions. Guests showed great interest in the "Liberation" brand four-ton truck, the first domestically manufactured vehicle in our history. An automotive engineer from West Germany considered the truck to be of good quality. He said, "The quality of your exhibits improves significantly every year. The rapid development of Chinese industry is truly astonishing." Equally attracting attention were the electron tubes produced by China's first electron tube factory, the 6,000-kilowatt Type 3116 steam turbine generator, the Type B-115 single-column gantry planer (planing width of 1.5 meters and length of 6 meters), and the Type C-112 single-spindle automatic lathe, among many other new products. Among the fifty machines on display, twenty-one were machine tools, fifteen of which were newly manufactured in the past year.

Among the metallurgical industrial products on display were over seven hundred types of steel sections, of which over five hundred were new varieties, including large-sized steel and high-quality alloy steels such as chromium-silicon-manganese steel and chromium-manganese-titanium steel.

Among the one hundred and seventy-plus chemical industry exhibits, over forty were new products, such as synthetic rubber, chemical dyes, plastics, Western medicines, and medical equipment, all of which China could not manufacture on its own in the past. The new exhibits in the field of medical equipment, such as X-ray machines, shadowless operating lamps, and comprehensive dental treatment units, attracted the attention of many visitors.

In addition to heavy industrial products, exhibits in other areas were also richer than in previous years. In terms of agricultural and local specialty products, in addition to soybeans, peanuts, rice, bristles, sausage casings, leather, tea, and tobacco, which enjoy a high reputation in the international market, some new high-quality varieties of agricultural products were also exhibited, such as Bima wheat and Golden Queen corn. China's rich and diverse aquatic products were also exhibited in Leipzig for the first time this year.

European women who are very fond of Chinese silk and brocade discovered many beautiful and colorful new products in the China Pavilion this year, such as Seteme satin, Oriental silk, West Lake silk, and Rainbow plaid.

Various new products marking the progress of China's handicraft industry cooperativization were also widely praised by guests from various countries. The ivory carving "Water Margin Heroes" and the velvet Temple of Heaven are new products after cooperativization. This year also featured models of Peking Opera costumes, showcasing the exquisite and delicate Chinese embroidery craftsmanship.

This year's China Pavilion also exhibited models of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the Anshan Iron and Steel's large-scale rolling mill, and the Yellow River harnessing project.

This year's China Pavilion at the Leipzig Spring Fair, like a mirror, reflects the great achievements that our country has already achieved as the first Five-Year Plan is about to be completed ahead of schedule and surpassing targets.

Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, March 4th: The China Pavilion at the Leipzig International Fair welcomed leaders of the Democratic German government and government delegations from various countries at 10:00 AM on March 3rd. After the visit, Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and Domestic Trade Heinrich Rau wrote inscriptions in the guestbook. Grotewohl wrote: "To the great Chinese people who are advancing on the road of building socialism, a friendly and fraternal salute." (Attached picture)

    来比锡博览会中国馆正式开放
    四千余种展品引起观众极大注意
    新华社来比锡5日电　1957年来比锡春季国际博览会中的中国馆同其他三十九个国家的五十多个展览馆一起向来自五十多个国家的观众正式开放。像往年一样，中国馆是吸引观众最多的展览馆之一。
    这是中国在来比锡国际博览会中第七次的展出。今年中国馆以四千二百种展品同观众见面，比去年的展品增加了88％。展品中很大一部分是最近一年内的新产品。
    特别引起观众注意的是重工业品，展出面积占全馆面积（五千平方公尺）的45％。这是以往历次展出中所没有过的情形。客人们以很大的兴趣参观了我国历史上第一次自己制造的“解放牌”四吨载重汽车。一位来自西德的汽车制造业工程师认为这种汽车质量很好。他说：“你们展品的质量每年都有显著的提高。中国工业发展之快实在令人惊奇。”同样吸引观众注意的是中国第一个电子管厂所生产的电子管、六千瓩的三一一六型汽轮发电机、B一一五型单柱龙门刨床（刨宽一公尺半、长六公尺）和C一一二型单轴自动车床等许多新产品。在展出的五十台机器中，有二十一台是工作母机，十五台是最近一年内新制成的。
    在展出的冶金工业产品中，有七百多种钢铁切片，其中五百多种都是新品种，包括大型钢材和铬釸锰钢、铬锰钛钢等优质合金钢。
    在一百七十多种化学工业展品中，有四十多种是新产品，如人造橡胶、化学染料、塑料、西药和医疗器材等，都是我国过去不能自己制造的东西。医疗器材方面的X光机、无影灯、牙科综合治疗台等新展品引起了许多观众的注意。
    除重工业产品外，其他方面的展品也比往年更加丰富。在农产品、土特产品方面，除了在国际市场上享有盛誉的大豆、花生、大米、猪鬃、肠衣、皮革、茶叶、烟叶外，还展出了一些新的优良品种的农产品，如碧玛小麦、金皇后玉米等。我国丰富多样的水产品今年也第一次在来比锡展出。
    非常喜爱中国的丝绸和锦缎的欧洲妇女，今年又在中国馆里发现了许多绮丽鲜艳的新产品，如色特美缎、东方绸、西湖绢、彩虹格等。
    标志着我国手工业合作化进展的多种新产品，也受到各国客人们的普遍赞扬。象牙雕刻的“水泊梁山”、绒制的天坛等都是合作化后的新产品。今年还展出了京剧的戏装模型。它表现了中国刺绣工艺的玲巧、精细。
    今年的中国馆还展出了武汉长江大桥、鞍钢大型轧钢厂、根治黄河水利工程等模型。
    今年来比锡春季博览会中的中国馆，像一面镜子似地反映出我国在第一个五年计划即将提前超额完成时已经获得的伟大成就。
    新华社来比锡4日电　来比锡国际博览会中的中国馆3日上午十时迎接了民主德国政府领导人和各国政府代表团。参观后，德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥和副总理兼对外与国内贸易部长海因里希·劳先后在留言簿上题词。格罗提渥写道：“向伟大的、在建设社会主义的道路上前进的中国人民致友好的兄弟般的敬礼。”（附图片）
