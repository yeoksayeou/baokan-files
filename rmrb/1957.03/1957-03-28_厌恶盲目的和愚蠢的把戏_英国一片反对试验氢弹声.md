　　Disgusted with Blind and Stupid Tricks
　　Britain Filled with Voices Opposing Hydrogen Bomb Tests
    Xinhua News Agency, London, March 27th: British newspapers and people from all walks of life are increasingly vocal in their opposition to hydrogen bomb tests. Yesterday, the "News Chronicle" reported that the Soviet Union's demand for an immediate ban on nuclear bomb tests is a real challenge to the West. The newspaper's editorial said that Britain should stop its tests, "so that it can play the leading role that the world is hoping for."
    Yesterday's editorial in the "Daily Herald" also opposed hydrogen bomb tests, calling them "blind, murderous, and stupid."
    The famous British philosopher Bertrand Russell said in a letter to "The Manchester Guardian" that nuclear weapons cannot defend Britain, and that in the event of war, possessing nuclear weapons would increase the possibility of Britain being destroyed. Three other letters to the editor published in yesterday's "Manchester Guardian" also opposed hydrogen bomb tests.
    The British Liberal Party Candidates Association has sent a telegram to Canadian Prime Minister St. Laurent, who is currently in Bermuda, asking him to use his influence on Macmillan to prevent the hydrogen bomb tests that Britain is about to conduct on Christmas Island.
    The annual meeting of the Silsden Women's Co-operative Guild today submitted a resolution to Prime Minister Macmillan demanding a ban on hydrogen bomb tests.

　　厌恶盲目的和愚蠢的把戏
　　英国一片反对试验氢弹声
    新华社伦敦27日电　英国报纸和各界人士反对氢弹试验的呼声日益高涨。“新闻纪事报”昨天的消息说，苏联提出的立即禁止试验核子炸弹的要求对西方是一个真正的挑战。这家报纸的社论说，英国应该停止它的试验，“这样它就能够起世界正在希望的带头作用”。
    “每日先驱报”昨天的社论也反对氢弹试验，说这是“盲目的、杀人的和愚蠢的”。
    著名的英国哲学家罗素在写给“曼彻斯特卫报”的一封信中说，核子武器并不能保卫英国，一旦发生战争，拥有核子武器倒增加了英国被毁灭的可能性。昨天“曼彻斯特卫报”发表的另外三封读者来信也反对氢弹试验。
    英国自由党候选人协会已经打电报给现在正在百慕大的加拿大总理圣劳伦，请他使用他对麦克米伦的影响以阻止英国即将在圣诞岛进行的氢弹试验。
    西尔奈斯区妇女合作公会的年度大会今天送交麦克米伦首相一项决议，要求禁止氢弹试验。
