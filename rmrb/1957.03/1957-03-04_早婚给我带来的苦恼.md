    The Troubles Early Marriage Brought Me
    To the Editor: In the February 23rd People's Daily news report "Beijing Medical Circles Discuss Late Marriage and Contraception," the harms of early marriage were mentioned, and I believe they are correct. I am a third-year university student who, due to early marriage and closely spaced pregnancies, seriously affected my health and therefore had to discontinue my studies.
    I originally worked in the military. In 1950, when I was eighteen years old, I got married. In 1952, I gave birth to my first child, and in early 1953, I became pregnant with my second. At that time, I felt I was still young and should go to university to study so that I could do more for the people in the future. In July of that year, I was admitted to a university in Wuhan. I was confident that I would strive for excellent grades in my studies, but I encountered a series of difficulties. When school started in September, it was my time of delivery. After my maternity leave, I rushed back to school and worked hard to catch up on the two months of coursework I had missed, earning excellent grades in the final exams. But the good times did not last long. In the summer of 1954, I became pregnant again. At that time, our studies were very demanding. I often thought that having another child would delay my studies, and I wouldn't be able to take good care of the child. My mental burden grew heavier and heavier. I didn't want to eat during the day and had nightmares at night, and my health suffered. When I entered my third year, my heart was beating irregularly, I couldn't participate in the labor and hygiene system, and I withdrew from the scientific research group. Because my husband and I only had the chance to meet once or twice a year, we did not adhere to contraception. Therefore, in early 1956, I became pregnant with my fourth child. At this time, my mental state deteriorated further, and I often fainted at school. For the sake of my health and studies, the organization approved me to go to the hospital for an induced abortion. Two weeks after the surgery, I went to school to take the exams, but I fainted again before finishing the second exam. Since then, I have suffered from severe anemia and extreme mental fatigue, and I have been bedridden. Even now, I am still saddened by the fact that I cannot graduate on time.
    I suggest that unmarried young students and young friends should preferably marry later. Yang Lin

### 早婚给我带来的苦恼

    早婚给我带来的苦恼
    编辑同志：2月23日人民日报发表的“首都医药界座谈晚婚和避孕问题”的新闻中，谈到早婚的害处，我认为是正确的。我是一个三年级的大学生，因为结婚过早、生育过密，严重地影响了身体的健康，因此，停止了学习。
    我原在部队里工作，1950年我十八岁时，就结了婚。1952年我生下第一个孩子，1953年初我又怀了第二个孩子。当时，我觉得我还年轻，应当进大学去学习，将来好为人民多做些事情。这年7月，我考取了武汉某大学，我满怀信心地要在学习中争取优良的成绩，可是我却遇到一连串的困难。9月里学校开学时，正是我的分娩期。产假满后，我赶回学校，辛辛苦苦的补上了已经耽误了两个月的功课，在期终考试时获得了优良的成绩。但是好景不长，1954年暑假我又怀孕了。当时，我们学习很紧张，我常常想再生孩子又要耽误功课，孩子也照顾不好，精神负担越来越重，白天不想吃、夜里做恶梦，身体健康受到了影响。当我进入三年级时，心脏跳动不正常，劳卫制不能参加，退出了科学研究小组。由于我和爱人每年只有一两次见面的机会，我们没有坚持避孕。因此，在1956年初，我又怀了第四个孩子，这时我的精神愈来愈坏，在学校里常常晕倒。为了我的身体和学习，组织上就批准我去医院作了人工流产，手术作过两个星期以后，我到学校去参加考试，第二门课还没有考完就又晕倒了。从此，我患了严重的贫血病和极度精神疲劳症，卧床不起。直到现在，我还为我不能按时毕业而难过。
    我建议未婚的青年同学和年轻朋友最好晚一点结婚。  杨林
