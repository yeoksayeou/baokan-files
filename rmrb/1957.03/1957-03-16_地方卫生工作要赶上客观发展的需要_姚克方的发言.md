    I wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao's instructions and the reports of Premier Zhou and other leaders.

    I am a local health worker and would like to speak on some of the main problems currently existing in local health work.

    The victory of the socialist revolution has fundamentally changed the face of the countryside. The contradiction between the relations of production and the productive forces has been resolved accordingly. Farmers have abandoned the private ownership of the means of production, changed the scattered production methods of the small-scale economy, and implemented a "payment according to labor, more work more pay" work-day system. Thanks to the improvement of ideological awareness brought about by socialism, farmers are working with unparalleled enthusiasm and initiative. Furthermore, because the remnant feudal forces have been defeated, women have broken free from the shackles of the family economy and embarked on the road of economic independence. Therefore, the protection, consolidation, and growth of the labor force has become an urgent requirement for every farmer. They demand to be liberated from the persecution and suffering of disease; they also demand to acquire the knowledge to fight against disease, so as to participate in the battle.

    Under this new situation, resolving the contradiction between agricultural production increase and the labor force has also become an important task in rural construction in the present and coming period. After agricultural cooperation, the organized farmers and the changed economic system have created many favorable conditions for eliminating diseases and improving rural health conditions. The main problem at present lies in how the health administrative leaders and health workers correctly recognize this change, and how to plan and rationally arrange health work so as to gradually adapt to the needs of objective development.

    In 1956, under the impetus of the high tide of cooperation and the leadership of Party and government at all levels, the masses were mobilized and all positive factors in the localities were organized. Like the rest of the country, Hubei Province has achieved considerable results on the health front. On the original basis, we established thirty-six schistosomiasis professional prevention and treatment stations, two hundred and thirty-two prevention and treatment teams; we also relied on social medical forces to establish two hundred and eight treatment units, and trained five thousand four hundred and twenty-five schistosomiasis prevention and treatment personnel and active elements of the masses, strengthening the ranks fighting against disease. Through extensive publicity and education, the masses were mobilized to carry out snail and egg eradication work in conjunction with production and manure accumulation, and the construction of farmland water conservancy. Some counties and townships, such as Nanzhang in Gucheng, have basically eliminated the intermediate host of schistosomiasis - Oncomelania hupensis, ensuring the safe production of farmers. In addition, more than 60,000 patients were treated under the mutual cooperation of traditional Chinese and Western medicine throughout the province, reducing the source of infection. Since the implementation of the new method of midwifery and new parenting methods, 40% of pregnant women have accepted the new method of midwifery, and a large majority of societies have organized nurseries or groups, liberating the female labor force. Family planning work has been carried out in a few areas. In areas where publicity has been done well, women have automatically gone to health centers or hospitals to apply for tubal ligation and learn other contraceptive methods.

    In order to meet the needs of the broad masses, and under the principle of giving full play to the potential of social medical care, we organized more than 5,000 joint clinics, solving the phenomenon of lack of doctors and medicines in rural areas, facilitating farmers, and enabling them to seek medical treatment locally. These social doctors, especially many traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, have a certain prestige in the local area and are trusted by the masses. Reasonable arrangement and use, and the granting of certain health technical knowledge, will play a great role. Doing so is entirely in line with the actual situation.

    Our achievements in health work in rural areas are undeniable, but in the inspection we found that our shortcomings and existing difficulties and problems are also numerous. These shortcomings need to be actively corrected, the existing difficulties gradually overcome, and the problems rationally resolved, so that our health work can catch up with objective development. The problems that exist:

    Implement the Four Principles in Health Work

    (1) The four principles of health work have not become our guiding principles for action, and have not been thoroughly understood ideologically. Therefore, they have not been well implemented in every task, and the work fluctuates from left to right. The main reason for this bias is that the administrative leadership does not have a deep understanding of the central policies, coupled with a lack of understanding of the overall situation and the laws of development, and a lack of foresight; and they do not pay enough attention to using scientific data from investigation and research, and statistical analysis as the basis for formulating plans, relying solely on subjective one-sided imagination, or dogmatic and empirical working methods, mechanically copying, which makes the plan divorced from reality and the work passive.

    The principle of Prevention First - Generally, health cadres have a very shallow understanding of prevention first as a basic element of socialist health work, and even believe that doing prevention work is not profitable and is a non-productive work; some technical cadres believe that prevention work lacks scientificity and is not worthy of being done by a highly educated physician; some students in the Department of Hygiene of medical colleges are happy to dance when they hear that the Department of Hygiene will be merged into the Department of Medicine; after some health physicians or medical assistants are assigned to health centers or enterprises and mines, the leaders ask them to do treatment, without realizing that only by implementing prevention can diseases be eliminated and epidemics be prevented, can the health of the broad masses of people be guaranteed, and can the attendance rate be improved and production increased.

    The principle of Serving Workers, Peasants and Soldiers - In the past year or so, political education on "serving the people" for cadres and students has been relaxed, and it has been one-sidedly understood that "marching towards science" must be done in large hospitals, universities, and research institutes; one must learn culture and take university entrance exams. In the health team, they are not content with their profession, unwilling to go to factories and rural areas, believing that going to factories and rural areas will ruin their future and waste their talents. These phenomena have been widespread since 1956 and are becoming increasingly serious. If they are not educated and corrected in time, the socialist consciousness of many young cadres and students will increasingly degenerate, and the bourgeois individualism will increasingly grow. On the other hand, the government should also take the initiative to formulate a set of encouragement and further education methods, so that every young person can receive spiritual encouragement and professional improvement.

    The principle of Unity between Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine - After criticizing the ideas of belittling and discriminating against traditional Chinese medicine, sectarian sentiments have basically been eliminated. The vast majority of Western medicine practitioners recognize the role that the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine has played and will play in medicine. Under the call of Western medicine practitioners learning traditional Chinese medicine, the majority of Western medicine practitioners actively strive to participate in learning. However, how to better strengthen unity and promote the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine in the future is worth further study. To promote the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, according to the principle of "discarding its dross and absorbing its essence," it seems that we should start from summarizing experience and sorting out literature first. It does not seem that we should "accept it all," but should proceed from the basis of "systematic learning" and the principle of cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine. The method of "putting on hats" is detrimental to unity and will play a negative role.

    The combination of health work and mass movements - Experience has proved that in places where the masses are mobilized, where the leadership is good at mobilizing the masses, and where the masses have a high health awareness, the achievements of health work are great. Although this is a well-known fact, most health workers still do not pay enough attention to it ideologically and in their working methods, and the old practice of "going it alone" is still very serious.

    Improving Middle and Primary Level Cadres is the Key to Solving the Low Quality of Grassroots Health Work

    (2) The quality of health work is not high. This is a very common phenomenon. At present, it is not uncommon for a county to not have a formal physician, and the work in the vast majority of counties and townships is undertaken by middle and primary level health cadres and local original informal doctors. This situation may not change much in a considerable period of time. Therefore, improving middle and primary level cadres is a very urgent matter in solving the problem of the low "quality" of grassroots health work. We plan to hold short-term professional training on the one hand, and improve the quality of hospitals and health prevention institutions at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels in stages and years, so that they can take on the responsibility of guidance and training at each level. The development of health work, whether in quantity or quality, must be "pyramidal," and we cannot adopt the biased approach of "top-heavy" only caring about the top and not the bottom, only caring about big cities and not rural areas. We must take both urban and rural areas into account.

    The rural situation is complex. Due to the different geographical conditions, different production and lifestyles, and different disease prevalence situations, health work cannot be uniform. It must be combined with reality, adapted to local conditions and times, and combined with production and life to unfold. Therefore, the unified leadership of the Party committee, rational arrangements, and the active support of the masses are the basic keys to doing a good job in health work. The working method of purely technical and purely therapeutic work must be corrected, otherwise it will not be able to meet the needs of rural areas.

### 地方卫生工作要赶上客观发展的需要  姚克方的发言

    地方卫生工作要赶上客观发展的需要
    姚克方的发言
    我衷心拥护毛主席的指示和周总理及各位首长的报告。
    我是一个地方卫生工作者，想就地方卫生工作中目前存在的几个主要问题作个发言。
    社会主义革命的胜利已使农村的面貌发生了根本上的变化。生产关系与生产力之间的矛盾随之获得了解决。农民已经放弃了生产资料私有制，改变了小农经济分散性的生产方式，实行了“按劳计酬，多劳多得”的工作日制。由于社会主义所带来的思想觉悟的提高，农民均以无比的热情和积极性从事于劳动。更由于打垮了封建残余势力，妇女已脱离了家庭经济的枷锁，走上了经济自主的道路。从而，劳动力的保护、巩固和增长遂成为每个农民的一项迫切要求。他们要求从疾病的迫害和苦难下得到解放；他们亦要求获得与疾病作斗争的知识，好参加到战斗队伍里来。
    在这种新形势发展下，解决农业增产与劳动力间的矛盾，亦遂成为目前和今后一个时期内农村建设中的一项重要任务。农业合作化之后，组织起来的农民和改变了的经济制度已替消灭疾病、改善农村卫生情况，创造了许多有利条件。目前的主要问题是在于卫生行政领导与卫生工作者如何正确地认识这种变化，如何来有计划地合理安排卫生工作，使逐步地适应于客观发展的需要。
    1956年在合作化高潮推动和各级党政的领导下，发动了群众并组织了地方的一切积极因素，湖北省像全国一样在卫生战线上已经取得了不少的战果。我们在原有基础上，建立了三十六个血吸虫病专业防治站，二百三十二个防治组；还依靠社会医疗力量成立了二百零八个治疗单位，训练了五千四百二十五个血吸虫病防治人员与群众的积极分子，壮大了与疾病作斗争的队伍。通过广泛的宣传教育，发动群众结合生产积肥和兴修农田水利，进行了灭卵灭螺工作。有好些县乡如谷城南障已基本上消灭了血吸虫病的中间宿主——钉螺，保证了农民安全生产。另外，全省中西医互相配合下治疗六万多病人，减少了传染源。自从推行新法接生与新育儿法后，40％的产妇接受了新法接生，很大多数的社组织了托儿站或组，解放了妇女劳动力。少数地区已开展了节育工作，宣传做得好的地区，妇女已自动地到卫生院或医院申请结扎输卵管，和学习其他避孕方法。
    为满足广大群众的需要，在充分发挥社会医疗潜力的原则下，我们组织了联合诊所五千多所，解决了农村中缺医缺药的现象，便利了农民，使能就地求医。这些社会医生，特别是不少中医，在当地是具有一定的威望，受到群众的信仰。合理的安排和使用，再授予一定的卫生技术知识，他们将起到莫大的作用。这样做是完全符合现实情况的。
    我们卫生工作在农村中的成绩是肯定的，但在检查中发现我们的缺点和存在的困难和问题亦是不少的。这些缺点须要我们积极地去纠正，存在的困难逐步地克服，问题合理地解决，使我们的卫生工作能赶上客观的发展。存在的问题：
    贯彻执行卫生工作中的四大原则
    （一）使卫生工作的四大原则成为我们的行动指针，在思想上还没彻底地认识。因之，未能很好地贯彻到每一项工作中去，工作就形成左右摇摆，不是偏左就是过右。产生这种偏向的主要原因，是由于行政领导对于中央政策的体会不深，加之对全面情况和发展规律缺乏了解，缺乏远见；又对运用调查研究、统计分析的科学资料作为制定计划的依据重视不够，单凭主观片面的想像，或教条主义经验主义的工作方法，生搬硬套，这样就使计划脱离实际，工作处于被动。
    预防为主的方针——一般卫生干部对预防为主为社会主义卫生工作的基本要素认识很浅，甚至认为做预防工作没有收益，是一种非生产性的工作；有的技术干部认为预防工作缺乏科学性，不值得一个受过高等教育的医师来做；有的医学院卫生系的学生听见卫生系将裁并到医疗系去，就乐得跳起舞来了；有些卫生医师或医士分配到卫生院或企业厂矿中去后，领导上要他们搞治疗，没有体会到只有贯彻了预防才能消灭疾病的发生和流行，才能保证广大人民的健康，才能提高出勤率，增加生产。
    面向工农兵的方针——由于近一年来对于干部和学生放松了“为人民服务”的政治教育，片面地理解“向科学进军”必须在大医院、大学校、研究院学习和工作；必须学文化考大学。在卫生队伍中不安心于专业，不愿意下厂下乡，认为下厂下乡就毁损了他的前途，浪费了他的才能。这些现象从1956年起是普遍的，并且日趋严重，若不即时地加以教育和纠正，会使很多青年干部和学生的社会主义觉悟日益堕落，资产阶级个人主义思想日益成长。另一方面，政府亦应主动拟订一套鼓励和进修办法，使每个青年得到精神上的鼓舞和专业上的提高。
    团结中西医的方针——在批判了轻视歧视中医的思想后，宗派主义情绪基本上已趋肃清，绝大部分西医认识到祖国医学遗产对医学已起和将要起到的作用。在西医学习中医的号召下，大部分西医积极地争取参加学习。但今后如何更好地加强团结，发扬祖国医学遗产还值得进一步研究。发扬祖国医学遗产，根据“弃其糟粕，取其精华”的原则，似应先从总结经验，整理文献着手，似不应“全面接受”，而应从“系统学习”的基础上和中西医配合的原则下来进行。“戴帽子”的方法是有损团结的，会起消极作用的。
    卫生工作与群众运动相结合——经验已证明，凡是群众发动起来的地方，领导善于发动群众和群众卫生觉悟高的地方，卫生工作的成绩是大的。这虽已是众所熟知的事实，但多数卫生工作者在思想上、工作方法上还是重视不够，“单打一”的旧作法还是很严重的。
    提高中初级干部是解决基层卫生工作质量不高的关键
    （二）卫生工作的质量不高。这是很普遍的现象。目前，一个县没有正式医师不是少数，绝大部分的县乡工作是靠中初级卫生干部与地方原有的非正式医生来担任的。这种情况在一个相当长的时间内可能还不会有多大的改变。因此，提高中初级干部，是一项解决基层卫生工作“质”低的问题中非常迫切的事项。我们拟在一面举行短期专业训练，一面分层分年提高省、专、县级的医院与卫生预防机构的素质，使能按级的负起指导和培训工作。卫生工作不论数量上与质量上发展必须是 “金字塔式”的，不能专门采取“头重脚轻”只顾上不顾下的方式，只顾大城市不顾农村的偏向，必须是城乡兼顾。
    农村情况是复杂的。由于地理情况的不同，生产与生活方式的不同，疾病流行情况的不同，卫生工作就不可能千篇一律，必须是结合实际，因地因时制宜，结合生产，结合生活来展开。因之，党委的统一领导，合理安排和群众的积极支持是做好卫生工作的基本关键。单纯技术、单纯治疗的工作方法必须纠正，否则是不能满足农村需要的。
