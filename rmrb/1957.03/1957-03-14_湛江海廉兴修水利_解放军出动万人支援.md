　　Zhanjiang Hailian Undertakes Water Conservancy Projects
　　PLA Dispatches 10,000 to Assist
　　(Our report) The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Zhanjiang, Hailian, and other areas of Guangdong Province have dispatched more than 10,000 personnel since the 12th to support the construction of over 20 local water conservancy projects. On the 9th, the Party Committee of the PLA units stationed in Zhanjiang held an enlarged meeting. The comrades present listened to the report from the responsible comrade of the Zhanjiang Prefectural Committee of the CPC and further understood the relationship between these 20-odd water conservancy projects and this year's bumper harvest, as well as the shortage of labor. The meeting immediately decided to allocate 10,000 people to support these water conservancy constructions for half a month. At the same time, it was also decided to try to solve the tool problem by themselves, without troubling the masses, and to obey the command of the government. On the 11th, many units had already mobilized, and from the 12th, the troops successively set off for the construction sites.
