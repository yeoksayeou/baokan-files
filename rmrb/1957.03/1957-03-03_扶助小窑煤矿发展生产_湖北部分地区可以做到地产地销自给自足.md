    Supporting the Development and Production of Small Coal Mines
    Some Areas in Hubei Can Achieve Local Production, Local Sales, and Self-Sufficiency
    (Our report) Wuhan Coal Construction Company actively organizes the purchase of local small coal mine coal, ensuring local coal supply and promoting the production of small coal mine coal.
    Coal is a nationally allocated material, but the state mainly controls and distributes the supply produced by large mines. Many small coal mines in local areas are not under unified state control. For example, the Xiangfan area originally had many small coal mines producing coal. Because the Coal Construction Company did not deeply understand the production situation and organize purchases, the production of small coal mines declined. The coal needed in this area was entirely transported from Wuhan, which not only took a month but also had transportation costs that were twice as high as the allocation cost.
    In December of last year, after the Beijing Coal Construction General Company held a meeting of provincial and municipal company managers, the Wuhan Coal Construction Company paid attention to this issue. After conducting in-depth investigations and research in areas such as Yichang, Shashi, Xiangfan, and Huangshi, they discovered that there were many small coal mines in these places, but they generally faced difficulties such as a shortage of funds, making it impossible to mine in large quantities. In addition, inconvenient transportation meant that the coal produced by farmers during slack farming seasons could not be transported out and sold in a timely manner, which also affected the continued production. The Coal Construction Company actively reported this to the local government, helping small coal mines overcome difficulties in funding and transportation, and organized purchasing work, starting from facilitating and developing production. After three months of efforts, they signed contracts in Changyang, Bashan, Yangxin and other places to purchase a total of 129,400 tons of coal from small coal mines throughout the year. In the future, the coal needed in Huangshi, Shashi, Yichang, Xiangfan and other areas within Hubei Province, except for a small amount of bituminous coal that still needs to be transferred from Wuhan, can basically achieve local production, local sales, and self-sufficiency.

### 扶助小窑煤矿发展生产  湖北部分地区可以做到地产地销自给自足

    扶助小窑煤矿发展生产
    湖北部分地区可以做到地产地销自给自足
    本报讯  武汉市煤建公司积极组织收购地方小窑煤炭，保证了地方煤炭供应，促进了小窑煤炭的生产。
    煤是国家统配物资，但是国家统一掌握分配的主要是大矿生产的货源，地方上还有很多小窑并没有归国家统一掌握。例如襄樊地区原有不少小窑生产煤炭，由于煤建公司没有深入了解生产情况，组织收购，结果小窑生产低落，这个地区需要的煤，全由武汉运去，不但需时一月，运费比调拨成本还高一倍。
    去年12月，北京煤建总公司召开省市公司经理会议后，武汉市煤建公司注意了这个问题。他们深入宜昌、沙市、襄樊、黄石等地区调查了解后，发现这些地方的小窑煤矿很多，但是一般存在着资金少，无法大量开采的困难，加上运输不便，农民利用农闲时节生产出来的煤炭，由于不能及时运出销售，也影响了生产的继续进行。煤建公司就积极向当地政府反映，帮助小窑克服资金和运输上的困难，从便利生产、发展生产入手，组织收购工作。经过三个月的努力，他们在长阳、巴山、阳新等地共签订了全年收购小窑煤十二万九千四百吨的合同。今后湖北省内黄石、沙市、宜昌、襄樊等地区所需要的煤炭，除了少数烟煤还需从武汉调剂外，基本上可以做到地产地销，自给自足。
