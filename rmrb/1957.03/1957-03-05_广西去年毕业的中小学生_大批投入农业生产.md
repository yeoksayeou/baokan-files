Guangxi Last Year's Middle and Primary School Graduates
    A Large Number Entered Agricultural Production

    (Our report) Last year, a large number of middle and primary school graduates in Nanning, Liuzhou, Guilin, Wuzhou and Rongxian, Yishan areas of Guangxi Province returned to the countryside to participate in agricultural production or serve as agricultural social accountants. In the four cities and Rongxian area alone, there were 498 middle and primary school graduates who went to the Baise area to serve as agricultural social accountants. More than one hundred middle and primary school graduates across the province participated in youth reclamation teams for long-distance land reclamation. More than 700 middle and primary school graduates in Nanning City participated in agriculture, industry, handicrafts, and various national construction projects. Binyang County also had 130 junior high school graduates participating in agricultural production and urban construction. Some middle and primary school graduates who had suspended their studies and were awaiting employment organized studies with the assistance of the government and the Communist Youth League. They participated in various social activities while studying, such as street grain rationing, social security, sanitation, support for the army and preferential treatment for military families, cultural and recreational propaganda, explanations at various exhibitions, afforestation, and support for suburban water conservancy projects.

    When this group of middle and primary school graduates first participated in industrial and agricultural production, they also encountered some difficulties. The educated youth who went to the minority areas to serve as accountants either were unaccustomed to the life, could not communicate in the local language, or were unfamiliar with the business. However, these difficulties did not defeat them. After active study, many of them were named advanced workers, and many joined the Communist Youth League. Li Guixing (female), a graduate of senior primary school who served as an agricultural social accountant in the Damiaoshan Miao Autonomous County, is a first-class advanced worker in Guangxi Province, and she gloriously attended the National Conference of Representatives of Agricultural Labor Models.

    广西去年毕业的中小学生
    大批投入农业生产
    本报讯  去年广西省南宁、柳州、桂林、梧州等市和容县、宜山两个专区有大批中、小学毕业生回到农村参加农业生产或担任农业社会计员工作。仅四个市和容县专区的中、小学毕业生到百色专区担任农业社会计员的就有四百九十八名。全省有一百多中、小学毕业生参加了远距离开荒的青年垦荒队。南宁市中、小学毕业生参加农业、工业、手工业和国家各项建设的有七百多人。宾阳县也有一百三十名初中毕业生参加了农业生产和城市建设工作。有些停学待业的中、小学毕业生，在政府和青年团协助下，组织了学习。他们一边学习一边参加各种社会活动，例如街道的粮食定量供应、社会治安、清洁卫生、拥军优属、文娱宣传、各种展览会的讲解、植树造林、支援郊区兴修水利等。
    这批中、小学毕业生在刚参加工农业生产时，也遇到过一些困难。到少数民族地区担任会计员工作的知识青年，他们或是生活不习惯、言语不通，或是业务生疏。但这些困难没有难倒他们。经过积极的学习，其中有许多人被评为先进工作者；有许多人参加了青年团。到大苗山苗族自治县担任农业社会计员的高小毕业生黎桂兴（女）是广西省一等先进工作者，她光荣的出席了全国农业劳动模范代表会议。
