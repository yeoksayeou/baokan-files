    Taiyuan City Inspects Waste of Construction Land
    3,000 Mu of Unused Land Returned to Farmers for Cultivation
    (This newspaper dispatch) According to the Shanxi Daily: The Taiyuan City Urban Construction Bureau, in conjunction with relevant units in the fourth quarter of last year, conducted a focused inspection of the land use by factories and mines that had requisitioned land in recent years. It was discovered that in the northern and western suburbs of Taiyuan alone, eighteen factory and mine units had wasted 3,330 mu of land due to reasons such as requisitioning without use, requisitioning too much and using too little, and early requisitioning with delayed use.
    The main reasons for this waste of land are: some land requisitioning units changed their plans, requisitioned land but did not use it, and did not promptly return it to the farmers for cultivation. Others had inadequate planning, requisitioning too much and using too little. A more common problem was early requisitioning with delayed use. The building authorities' lack of clear understanding of the land-using units and their careless approval process were also important reasons.
    The large-scale waste of land has caused significant losses to the state. The compensation fee for the above-mentioned inspected land alone is more than 300,000 yuan. At the same time, grain production is reduced by about 17 million jin per year, which could feed 4,200 people for a year.
    In order to reduce and eliminate the waste caused by this, the responsible departments in Taiyuan City have decided to recover the surplus and temporarily unused land found during the inspection and return it to the farmers for cultivation.

    太原市检查浪费建设用地现象
    三千亩未用土地交农民耕种
    本报讯  据山西日报报道：太原市城市建设管理局在去年第四季度会同有关单位，对几年来征用土地的厂矿使用土地的情况进行了重点检查，发现仅太原北郊、西郊十八个厂矿单位，就因征而未用、征多用少、早征迟用等，荒芜土地三千三百三十余亩。
    造成这种荒芜土地的主要原因，有的是征地单位计划变更，征了未用，也没有及时交回，让给农民耕种。有的是计划不周，征多用少。较普遍的是早征迟用。建筑主管部门对用地单位摸不清底，审批草率，也是重要原因之一。
    土地大量荒芜给国家造成了很大的损失。仅以上述检查出的土地计，补偿费就得三十多万元。同时每年要少产粮食约一千七百万斤，可供四千二百人食用一年。
    为减少和消灭因此而造成的浪费，太原市的主管部门已决定将检查出的剩余和暂不使用的土地予以收回，交给农民耕种。
