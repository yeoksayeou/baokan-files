Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 22nd. According to recent statistics from relevant departments in Gansu Province, state-owned and local industrial enterprises in Gansu Province have reached the total output value level of the First Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. By the end of December 1956, the total industrial output value of the province completed 102.37% of the Five-Year Plan. The output of major products such as gasoline, diesel, flour, bricks, machine-made paper, and cotton cloth exceeded the Five-Year Plan by 13% to 91%.

Gansu Province's industry was originally very backward, but it has now developed greatly. The total industrial output value in 1956 increased by about two and a half times compared with 1952. The number of state-owned, local state-owned, joint state-private, and cooperative-run factories and mines increased from 170 in 1952 to 301 in 1956.

In order to build Gansu into a new industrial base, the focus in the First Five-Year Plan was on developing the production of means of production, with an average annual increase of 40.2% in the output value of means of production. Originally, Gansu did not have a real machine manufacturing factory. The state-owned Lanzhou General Machinery Factory could only produce some parts and undertake repair and assembly tasks before 1953. After improving equipment and technology, it can now produce batches of petroleum machinery. In the past, the new-style agricultural tools used by farmers in Gansu were entirely supplied by other regions. Two new agricultural tool factories were built in 1953, and last year alone, they produced more than 200,000 mountain plows, seven-inch plows, and liberation-style waterwheels for farmers.

The coal, electricity, and building materials industries in Gansu have also developed rapidly. In 1952, there were only 40 larger coal mines, power plants, and building materials factories. By the end of 1956, the number had increased to 76 factories and mines, including more than double the number of large brick and tile factories.

There has also been considerable development in the production of consumer goods. The number of machine-made flour mills has increased from nine to eighteen. Originally, there was only one machine-made oil pressing factory in the province. Now, eleven oil pressing factories and workshops have been built in Wuzhong, Guyuan, Haiyuan, Jiuquan, Linxia and other places rich in oil crops, so that Gansu Province's edible oil has changed from relying on supplies from other regions to being self-sufficient, and a part of it is also transported out. In addition, Gansu Province has also built mechanized dairy factories, wool textile factories, etc. in recent years. Pharmaceutical factories, ink factories and glass factories were moved from Shanghai last year, partially meeting the needs of the local people.

During the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, the technical strength of various factories and mines has continued to grow. In 1956, the number of technical personnel more than doubled compared with 1952. Due to the improvement of technical level, various factories and mines have increased hundreds of new products. The quality of many products has also been greatly improved. For example, agricultural tools, uniform serge, jacquard carpets, leather shoes and other products were unsalable due to poor quality, but now these products have become popular goods.

　　甘肃省国营和地方国营工业企业
　　提前达到五年计划总产值水平
    新华社兰州22日电　据甘肃省有关方面最近统计，甘肃省国营工业和地方工业已提前一年达到了第一个五年计划的总产值水平，到1956年12月底为止，全省工业总产值完成五年计划的102.37％；汽油、柴油、面粉、砖瓦、机制纸和棉布等主要产品产量，比五年计划超额了13％到91％。
    甘肃省工业原来很落后，现在已经有了很大发展。1956年的工业总产值比1952年增加约两倍半；国营、地方国营、公私合营和合作社营厂矿，由1952年的一百七十个发展到1956年的三百零一个。
    为了把甘肃建设成新的工业基地，在第一个五年计划中，着重发展了生产资料的生产，平均每年生产资料的生产产值递增40.2％。原来甘肃没有一个真正的机器制造厂，国营兰州通用机器厂在1953年以前只能生产一些零件和担负修配任务，经过改进设备和提高技术以后，现在已经能生产成批的石油机械。甘肃农民过去使用的新式农具，完全依靠外区供应，1953年新建两个农具厂，仅在去年就为农民生产了二十多万部山地步犁、七吋步犁和解放式水车。
    甘肃的煤、电和建筑材料工业也发展很快。1952年只有四十个较大的煤矿、电厂和建筑材料厂，到1956年底就发展到七十六个厂矿，其中大型砖瓦厂增加一倍多。
    消费资料生产方面也有相当发展。机制面粉厂由九个增加到十八个；原来全省只有一座机制榨油厂，现在在盛产油料作物的吴忠、固原、海原、酒泉和临夏等地已建成十一个榨油厂和榨油车间，使甘肃省的食油由依靠外区供应变为自给自足，并且还有一部分外运。此外，甘肃省这几年还新建了机械化的乳品厂、毛纺织厂等。去年由上海迁来制药厂、墨水厂和玻璃厂，部分地满足了当地人民需要。
    第一个五年计划执行中，各厂矿企业的技术力量不断成长，1956年技术人员比1952年增加两倍多。由于技术水平的提高，各厂矿增加了上百种的新产品。许多产品的质量也大大提高了。例如原来农具、制服呢、提花毯、皮鞋等产品由于质量不高造成积压滞销，现在这些产品已经变成畅销货。
