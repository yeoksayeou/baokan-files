In its March 15th “Notice on Several Matters Concerning Democratic Cooperative Management,” the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party emphasized that cooperative cadres should participate in production.

There are many excellent cooperative cadres who are sincerely supported by the cooperative members. They are extremely busy with the collective enterprise. However, they are unwilling to leave productive labor. Li Shunda, Geng Changsuo, Lü Hongbin, Rao Xingli, and others are such people. In addition to these well-known figures, there are also many such people in cooperatives across the country. Guan Musheng, the director of the Changfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, introduced in this newspaper's March 2nd editorial and newsletter, is one of them. They have to attend some meetings and participate in some activities outside the cooperative; however, as soon as they return to the cooperative, they participate in productive labor even more vigorously. The cooperative members trust them very much. The people of the whole cooperative are of one heart and one mind, and everything is easy to handle, and any difficulties can be overcome. In the recent Party rectification and cooperative consolidation in various rural areas, some very interesting things can also be seen: As soon as the cooperative consolidation was about to begin, some cooperative cadres who had not participated in or rarely participated in production for a long time automatically participated in production. In this way, some uncoordinated emotions between the cooperative cadres and the cooperative members quickly changed, the cooperative members' enthusiasm for production immediately greatly increased, and the cooperative cadres also got rid of their passive situation, and their leadership work became smoother. These facts all show that cooperative cadres can only closely connect with the masses if they participate in production, and they will be separated from the masses if they are separated from production.

Cooperative cadres still have many official duties to handle. Some people feel that in order to do their best in handling official duties, they must reduce the time spent participating in production; if they participate in more production, they may not be able to handle official duties well. What is the best way to do it? It cannot be denied that there are indeed some contradictions here. As long as we think of a good way, this contradiction can be resolved.

We must be good at arranging time and improve working methods. Yuanxi Township, a model township for agricultural production increase in Longxi County, one of the "thousand-catty counties" in Fujian, established the "Anxin" Agricultural Production Cooperative (an advanced cooperative, in which all households in the township participated). The main cadres of this township and cooperative all participated in the cooperative's productive labor in 1956, each earning an average of more than two hundred workdays; the cooperative director, who was already fifty years old, earned two hundred and fifty-two workdays in participating in production; the Party branch secretary, who was responsible for the township's main leadership work, earned two hundred and eighty-five workdays in participating in production; and the Communist Youth League branch secretary earned three hundred and seven workdays in participating in production. Did they delay handling official duties by engaging in so much productive labor? No. Look at how well they did their work: Grain production increased by 31 percent compared to 1955, the total income from diversified operations increased by 43 percent compared to 1955, the national unified purchase task was overfulfilled, the income of cooperative members greatly increased, and the agricultural cooperative was managed very solidly. They are good at arranging time, and their working methods are also good. This township has insisted on not holding meetings during the day for the past year; holding small meetings more often in production teams and groups and holding fewer mass meetings; not holding unprepared meetings, and shortening meeting times. The cadres have a clear division of labor, everyone has something to do, and everything is managed by someone. More importantly, they often participate in production, the cooperative members are close to them, and they can easily understand the cooperative members' thoughts and problems in production, and many specific problems are solved at any time in production. In fact, the most important official duty of the cooperative is to lead production. Separated from production, it is difficult to handle official duties well; only by participating in production can official duties be handled well.

In order to enable cooperative cadres to participate in production better, the Party committees at the county, district, and township levels should earnestly improve their leadership methods in accordance with the March 15th notice of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Unnecessary meetings should not be held. County and district cadres should go to the cooperatives more often, and should not always mobilize cooperative cadres to come to the county. Some places often convene three-level cadre meetings, even "expanding" cooperative cadres into them. This practice should be greatly curtailed. It is best not to hold this kind of meeting more than twice a year.

The issue of labor remuneration for cooperative cadres should also be reasonably resolved. The principle is: it should encourage cooperative cadres to participate in productive labor, and it should also encourage cooperative cadres to do a good job in leadership work. The specific calculation method can vary according to the specific circumstances of each place and each cooperative. The size of the cooperatives is different, the content of production and operation is different; some cooperatives have resident cadres sent by higher authorities, and some cooperatives do not; even for large cooperatives, some are managed uniformly, and some sub-cooperatives (or teams) are responsible for their own profits and losses; the positions, abilities, and work performance of cooperative cadres are also different. Therefore, a unified and rigid regulation cannot be made for the method of paying labor remuneration to cooperative cadres. Generally speaking, cooperative cadres always delay work because they have to handle official duties. The part of the work delay due to public affairs should be subsidized by the cooperative. Some cooperatives have the cooperative members publicly discuss the necessary number of work delays for each cadre in a year based on the specific circumstances of the cooperative and pay a fixed number of workdays as remuneration. If special circumstances occur and too much work is delayed, it can be discussed again; if the work is done particularly well and the cooperative's income increases a lot, an award can be given at the end of the year. Some cooperatives assess the remuneration of cooperative cadres on a monthly or quarterly basis by grade. Some cooperatives adopt the method of "fixed subsidy (giving a fixed subsidy for one year), fixed-work production (must participate in a certain amount of productive labor in one year) and year-end bonus combined." Each cooperative can flexibly adopt these methods. In short, it is good if it is discussed publicly by the masses and approved by the cooperative members.

The number of subsidized work points and the number of people receiving fixed remuneration should be kept to a minimum. The model regulations for advanced agricultural production cooperatives stipulate that the labor days spent on cooperative affairs should not exceed 2 percent of the total labor days of the cooperative at most; this is a number that cannot be higher under any circumstances. Some cooperatives can do less than 1 percent, which is very good. Some cooperatives exceed 2 percent, which is very bad. It must be understood that this is not only related to the income of cooperative members, not only an economic issue, but also affects the relationship between cooperative members and cooperative cadres, and affects the ideological health of cooperative cadres. It should be known that the purpose of running socialist undertakings is definitely not to create a group of people with special status who are separated from production. A production team leader of a cooperative once said: "Leading thousands of acres of fields and hundreds of households, how can there be time for production? Leadership is meritorious, and you can get dividends even if you don't produce." This is not a correct view. From the situation of Yuanxi Township mentioned above, it can be understood, and the facts of many agricultural cooperatives in various places can also prove that cooperative cadres can participate in productive labor, and only by participating in productive labor can they be closely united with the masses, handle collective production matters well, and only in this way can their living standards be improved along with the cooperative members.

### 社干部要参加生产劳动

    社干部要参加生产劳动
    中共中央三月十五日发出的关于民主办社几个事项的通知中强调指出，社干部要参加生产。
    有许多优秀的社干部，受到社员群众的衷心拥护。他们为了集体的事业忙得不可开交。但他们并不愿意离开生产劳动。李顺达、耿长锁、吕鸿宾、饶兴礼等等就都是这样的人。除了这几位大家熟知的人而外，全国各地的合作社也有很多很多这样的人。本报在三月二日的社论和通讯中介绍的湖北孝感县长风农业社主任官木生，就是其中的一个。他们要参加一些会议，参加一些社外的活动；可是，他们一回到社里，就更加劲地参加生产劳动。社员十分信任他们，全社的人同心协力，什么事情都好办，什么困难都能克服。在最近各地农村整党整社当中，也可以看到这样一些很有意思的事情：刚要整社，一些很久不参加或者很少参加生产的社干部就自动地参加生产了。这样，社干部同社员之间的某些不协调的情绪很快就有所改变，社员的生产积极性立即大为提高，社干部也摆脱了被动的境况，在领导工作当中也就较顺利了。这些事实都可以说明：社干部只有参加生产才能密切联系群众，而脱离生产就会脱离群众。
    社干部毕竟还有许多公事要办。有些人觉得：要尽力办公事，就要减少参加生产的一些时间；要多参加生产，就可能办不好公事。究竟怎样做才好？不能不承认，这里的确有一些矛盾。只要好好想办法，这矛盾是可以解决的。
    要善于安排时间，要改进工作方法。福建的千斤县之一龙溪县，有一个农业增产模范乡——园溪乡。这个乡办了一个“安心”农业生产合作社（是一个高级社，全乡各户都参加了）。这个乡和社的主要干部，1956年都参加了社里的生产劳动，每人平均得了二百多个劳动日；社主任已经是五十岁的老人了，在参加生产中还得了二百五十二个劳动日；担负全乡主要领导工作的党支部书记在参加生产中得了二百八十五个劳动日；团支部书记在参加生产中得了三百零七个劳动日。他们从事了这么多的生产劳动，误了办公事没有？没有。看他们把工作做得多么出色：粮食产量比1955年增加了百分之三十一，多种经营的总收入比1955年增加了百分之四十三，超额完成了国家统购任务，社员们的收入大大增加，农业社办得十分巩固。他们善于安排时间，工作方法也好。这个乡一年来坚持了白天不开会；多在生产队、组开小会，少开群众大会；不开没准备的会，缩短会议时间。干部有明确的分工，人人有事干，事事有人管。更重要的是他们经常参加生产，社员对他们亲近，他们也容易了解社员的思想和生产中的问题，许多具体问题在生产中就随时解决了。其实，社里的最重要的公事就是领导生产。脱离了生产，反而难把公事办好；只有参加生产，才能办好公事。
    为了使社干部能更好地参加生产，县、区、乡各级党委应该按照中共中央三月十五日的通知，切实地改进领导方法。不必要的会议不要开，县、区干部要多到社里去，而不要时常调集社干部到县里来。有些地方动不动就召开三级干部会，以至把社干部也“扩大”进去，这种作法应该大大加以节制。这种会最好一年不要超过两次。
    社干部的劳动报酬问题也应当加以合理的解决。原则是：既要能鼓励社干部参加生产劳动，又要能鼓励社干部做好领导工作。具体的计酬办法，可以根据各地各社的具体情况有所不同。社的大小不同、生产经营的内容不同；有些社有上级派来的驻社干部，有些社没有；同是大社，有的统一经营，有的分社（或队）各负盈亏；社干部的职务、能力、工作成绩也各不相同。因此，对于付给社干部劳动报酬的办法不能作统一的硬性的规定。一般地说，社干部既要办公事，总要误工。因公误工的部分，是应该由社补贴的。有些社由社员按本社具体情况公议各个干部一年因公误工的必要数目，付给固定数目的劳动日作为报酬，发生了特殊的情况误了太多的工，可以再议；工作做得特别好，全社增加收入很多，年终可以评奖。有些社按月或按季分级评定社干部的报酬。有些社采用“定额补贴（一年给以固定的补贴）、定工生产（一年一定要参加一定数额的生产劳动）和年终奖励相结合”的办法。这些办法各社可以灵活采用，总之，要经过群众公议、社员赞成就好。
    补贴工分的数目和拿固定报酬的人数，都应当力求其少。高级农业生产合作社示范章程中规定，为社务工作付出的劳动日，至多不能超过全社劳动日总数的百分之二；这是一个无论如何不能再高的数目。有些社能够做到不到百分之一，那是很好的。也有些社超出了百分之二，那就太不好了。必须了解，这不只是和社员收入有关，不只是个经济性质的问题，而且影响社员同社干部的关系，影响社干部的思想健康。要知道，办社会主义事业的目的决不是要造成一批有特殊地位的脱离生产的人物。有一个合作社的生产队长曾经说过这样的话：“领导千亩田，百家户，哪有时间生产？领导有功，不生产也得分红。”这并不是正确的看法。从上面说到的园溪乡的情况就可以了解，各地许多农业社的事实也都可以证明：社干部有可能参加生产劳动，也只有参加了生产劳动，才能紧密地同群众团结在一起，把集体的生产事情办好，而且也只有这样，自己的生活水平才能和社员群众一同提高。
