    Soviet Construction Briefs
      Heavy-Duty Trackless Trolley
    The Uritz Vehicle Manufacturing Plant has successfully trial-produced a heavy-duty trackless trolley. It has a trailer and can carry twelve tons. Considering that this type of transport trolley needs to travel in places that are not necessarily close to the trackless trolley lines, batteries have been installed in the vehicle so that it can also carry out transport work independently. The battery capacity is sufficient for the trolley to travel 22 kilometers when loaded and 28 kilometers when empty.
    The driving speed of this heavy-duty trackless trolley is 30 kilometers per hour, and 10 to 12 kilometers per hour when using battery power.
      Fruit Packaging Factory
    In 1955, the Moldavian Republic's canning industry trust established an unusual factory called the "Mechanized Fruit Packaging Factory" at the Frunze State Farm, which is the first such factory in the Soviet Union. This factory uses mechanized methods to classify and package fruits, which not only greatly reduces labor but also improves the quality of packaging and reduces costs. Now, the Soviet Ministry of Food Industry has decided to establish such factories in all fruit-producing areas, such as Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and other places.
        Refrigerated Train
    The Bryansk Machine Building Plant has newly manufactured a refrigerated train. This train consists of three metal carriages and is equipped with a diesel generator and heating device. This type of train can warm the air in the carriages in winter and cool it in summer. The refrigerator in the carriage can lower the temperature to minus twenty degrees, and the electric furnace can raise the temperature to fourteen degrees. This train is specially used to transport perishable food. Its carrying capacity is 125.5 tons. (Jun) (with picture)

    苏联建设简讯
      载重无轨电车
    乌里茨车辆制造厂试制成功了一种载重的无轨电车。它带有拖车一辆，能载重十二吨。考虑到这种运输用载重电车需要走过的地方，不一定全都距无轨电车的线路很近，因此在车中安装了蓄电池，使它也能独立从事运输工作。蓄电池的容电量可以够电车载重时行走二十二公里之用，够空车行走二十八公里之用。
    这种载重无轨电车的行车速度是每小时三十公里，用蓄电池的电力行走时每小时为十至十二公里。
      水果包装工厂
    1955年，摩尔达维亚共和国的罐头业托辣斯在伏龙芝国营农场建立了一个不平常的工厂，叫做“机械化水果包装工厂”，这是苏联第一个这样的工厂。这个工厂是用机械化方法对水果进行分类和包装工作，这不仅大大减轻了劳动，而且还提高了包装的质量，降低了费用。现在，苏联食品工业部已决定在所有盛产水果的地区，如格鲁吉亚、乌克兰、乌兹别克斯坦等地，普遍建立这种工厂。
        冷藏列车
    布梁斯克机器制造工厂新制成了一列冷藏列车。这列车是由三节金属车箱组成的，它装有柴油发电机和暖气装置。这种列车，在冬季可以把车箱空气烧暖，夏季可以冷却，车箱里的冰箱可以使温度下降到零下二十度，电炉又可以使温度上升至十四度。这种列车专用来运输容易坏的食品。它的载重量是一百二十五吨半。 （君）（附图片）
