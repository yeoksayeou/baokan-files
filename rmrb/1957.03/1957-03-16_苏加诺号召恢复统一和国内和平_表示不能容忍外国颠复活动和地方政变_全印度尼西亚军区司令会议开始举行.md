Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 15th: President of the Republic of Indonesia and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces Sukarno delivered a radio address to the nation on the evening of the 14th, asking the Indonesian people to safeguard the security of the country, placing it above personal and group interests, in order to overcome the current crisis.

Sukarno asked the armed forces to maintain the current national system and not arbitrarily depose legitimate national institutions. The Supreme Commander called on all officers and soldiers of the armed forces to abide by the constitution, the general laws of the country, and especially the martial law decree, in order to maintain public order and preserve manpower and wealth for construction.

Sukarno explained why he declared the country in a state of war and emergency seven and a half hours earlier, saying that in the current international tension, foreign subversive activities within Indonesia were rampant, and divisions and antagonisms among Indonesians had reached their peak. Coups and seizures of power had occurred successively in some regions. He said: "We cannot tolerate this situation. If we tolerate this situation, the foundation and unity of our country will be destroyed, and the reputation of our country will be lowered."

Sukarno called on the people to continue the struggle in the spirit of the August 1945 Declaration, to complete the revolution, and to restore unity and domestic peace. He asked the people to maintain and preserve the Republic as an institution for carrying out the people's struggle, and to respect national institutions.

After President Sukarno delivered his radio address, Army Chief of Staff Nasution issued an order, commanding military personnel to observe discipline and defend the security of the country. He asked officers not to establish separate organs of power outside the existing national institutions.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 15th: The All-Indonesia Military Region Commanders Conference began in Jakarta this morning. The meeting was presided over by Army Chief of Staff Major General Nasution.

The meeting will discuss the implementation of military martial law throughout the country, the recent separatist events in some areas, and other military issues.

Six of the seven military region commanders in Indonesia attended the meeting, including Lieutenant Colonel Barlian, acting commander of the Second Military Region of South Sumatra, who recently established a military government in his jurisdiction without authorization, and Lieutenant Colonel Sumual, commander of the Seventh Military Region in East Indonesia.

Colonel Abimanyu, commander of the Sixth Military Region in Kalimantan, is still on trial in Jakarta because of his involvement in the Lubis affair, so the chief of staff attended on his behalf.

Also attending the meeting were commanders of some military areas (smaller in scope than military regions). Only Lieutenant Colonel Hussein of Central Sumatra is said to be unable to attend due to illness.

Lieutenant Colonel Sumual, who established a military government in Makassar, said when he arrived in Jakarta yesterday that he would give a "responsible account" of the Sulawesi incident to the army leadership.

    苏加诺号召恢复统一和国内和平
    表示不能容忍外国颠复活动和地方政变
    全印度尼西亚军区司令会议开始举行
    据新华社雅加达15日电  印度尼西亚共和国总统兼武装部队最高统帅苏加诺14日晚上向全国发表广播演说，要求印度尼西亚人民维护国家的安全，把它放在个人利益和集团利益之上，以克服目前的危机。
    苏加诺要求武装部队维护目前的国家制度，不要专横地废黜合法的国家机关。最高统帅号召武装部队全体官兵遵守宪法、国家一般的法律特别是戒严令，以便维持公共秩序，来保存人力和财富用于建设方面。
    苏加诺解释他为什么在七个半钟头以前宣布国家处于战争和紧急状态，他说，在目前的国际紧张局势下，外国在印度尼西亚国家内所进行的颠复活动猖獗起来，而印度尼西亚人中间的分裂和对立也达到了极点。有些地区相继发生了政变和攫取政权的事件。他说：“我们不能容忍这种情况。如果容忍这种情况，我们的国家基础和统一就要被摧毁，我们国家的声誉也就要降低。”
    苏加诺呼吁人民继续本着1945年8月宣言的精神进行斗争，完成革命，恢复统一和国内和平。他要求人民维护和保全共和国，以共和国作为进行人民斗争的机构，并且要尊重国家机关。
    苏加诺总统发表广播演说以后，陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安发布了命令，他命令军事人员遵守纪律，捍卫国家的安全。他要求军官们不要在现有的国家机关以外另立权力机关。
    据新华社雅加达15日电  全印度尼西亚军区司令会议今天上午已经在雅加达开始举行。会议由陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安少将主持。
    这次会议将要讨论关于全国实施军事戒严令问题、最近在一些地区发生的分裂事件问题和其他军事问题。
    在印度尼西亚的七个军区中有六个军区司令出席了会议，其中包括最近在自己所管辖的军区内擅自成立军政府的南苏门答腊第二军区代理司令巴利安中校和在东印度尼西亚的第七军区司令苏穆阿尔中校。
    在加里曼丹的第六军区司令阿比曼尤上校因为同卢比斯事件有牵连，现在还在雅加达受审，所以由参谋长代表出席。
    参加会议的还有一些军事地区（范围较军区小）的司令。只有中苏门答腊的侯赛尼中校据说因病而不能出席。
    在望加锡成立军政府的苏穆阿尔中校昨天到达雅加达的时候说，他将向陆军领导上对苏拉威西事件作“负责的交代”。
