Fully Utilize the Transport Power of Wooden Sailing Ships
　　Yuan Xingnan
In our country's inland river navigation industry, wooden sailing ships are numerous, widely distributed, and have a relatively large transport volume. They can penetrate into the vast rural areas along the rivers, acting as a distribution hub for cities, steamships, and trains, forming a transportation network for urban and rural material exchange.

According to incomplete statistics in 1956, there were approximately 240,000 professional wooden sailing ships on inland rivers nationwide, with a carrying capacity of over 2.76 million tons, employing approximately 3 million people including their families. At the end of 1956, it was estimated that the freight volume completed accounted for 82.25% of the total local inland river transport volume nationwide, with a turnover volume of 63.96%. The volume of transport completed increased by 1.12 times compared to 1952. In addition, there are a large number of sideline boats in the rural areas along the rivers. In Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces alone, there are approximately 77,000 sideline boats. These civilian boats will still be a transportation force that cannot be ignored for a considerable period in the future. In particular, professional boats have basically achieved cooperativization last year and are playing an active role in transportation.

Last year, a new situation emerged on the inland river transportation front, namely, a sharp increase in transported materials and a general feeling of insufficient transportation capacity. Hebei Province's consignment volume last year exceeded the transportation production plan by approximately 800,000 tons. In Jiangsu Province, the volume of materials consigned in August last year increased by 38% compared to the same period in 1955, 47% in September, 49% in October, and a further 26% in November compared to October. In Liaoning Province, the volume of materials transported in the first half of last year increased nearly threefold compared to the same period in 1955. Due to the transportation tension, a large amount of materials could not be transported every month, and the backlog of materials was very serious.

However, on the other hand, the transportation efficiency of wooden sailing ships has not been fully utilized. Comparing the estimated completion of local inland rivers nationwide in 1956 with 1955, the turnover volume increased by only 3.6%. The annual output per ton of ship was approximately 2,420 ton-kilometers, with an average of just over six kilometers traveled per ton of ship per day. Among them, the average annual output per ton of ship in Sichuan was 3,304 ton-kilometers; and the annual output per ton of ship of state-owned wooden sailing ships in Shandong was 7,130 ton-kilometers. However, the average annual output per ton of ship in some provinces was only about 1,700 ton-kilometers, and many sideline boats were utilized even worse.

Due to the low efficiency of wooden sailing ships, coupled with the fact that there are still many problems in the operation and management of some cooperatives, the freight rates are low, and the production of some cooperatives has declined, directly affecting the income of boat workers and boat people. Therefore, some boat people have developed negative emotions, believing that engaging in transportation is not as good as agriculture, resulting in phenomena of requests to withdraw from the cooperative and change careers.

The reason why wooden sailing ships have not been fully utilized is certainly due to some objective factors, such as water depletion, freezing, port congestion, and untimely supply of ship repair materials, etc. However, the main reason is that the shipping department still has a one-sided view of "valuing steamships over wooden ships" in transportation organization. Therefore, although some areas are nominally in charge, they are actually limited to general distribution of freight and collection of management fees. Some even adopt the practice of prioritizing state-owned, then joint state-private, and finally cooperative operation for freight transport. For example, the wooden sailing ships at Songkou Port in Guangdong were originally loaded with goods and ready to set sail, but because the state-owned ships had no goods, they forcibly unloaded a portion of the grain loaded on the wooden sailing ships for the state-owned ships to transport, causing dissatisfaction among the cooperative members. Others blindly pursue the completion of state-owned plans, while squeezing out wooden sailing ships. For example, the Zhujiang Shipping Bureau over-planned the transportation volume for state-owned tugboats last year, while under-planning for wooden sailing ships. The transportation volume of some barges in Guangxi has already reached 167.02% of 1955, and the turnover volume was 152.71%; while the transportation volume of wooden sailing ships dropped to 63.03%, and the turnover volume dropped to 47.08%, even down to 36.77%. As a result, boat people in individual areas have not had any freight for a long time and have to go to the mountains to collect firewood to make a living; individual areas believe that wooden sailing ships are "backward" and "surplus," and are organizing wooden sailing ships to change careers. This greatly increases the burden on steamships and other means of transportation, affecting the smooth flow of materials.

The tense situation on the transportation front over the past year has put great pressure on the shipping department, but the work of organizing social transportation forces has not only not received due attention, but the phenomenon of suppressing the efficiency of wooden sailing ships has become increasingly serious. In the transportation plans compiled by some provinces this year, the planned transport volume of tugboats increased by 28.6% compared to the previous year, and the turnover volume increased by 40%, while the transport volume of wooden sailing ships increased by 14.6%, and the turnover volume decreased to 9.9%. Some regions even reduced it by more than 8% compared to 1956.

The potential of wooden sailing ships in Sichuan, Shandong and other provinces is very large. The average annual output per ton of ship in Sichuan is more than 3,300 ton-kilometers, and this year's plan is to increase it to 3,676 kilometers. If we try to increase the annual output per ton of ship to the level of Sichuan Province, the annual output per ton of ship can be increased by 880 ton-kilometers, and inland rivers nationwide can complete an additional 2.4288 billion ton-kilometers of freight turnover for the state in one year, which is equivalent to the total turnover volume completed by local inland river tugboats nationwide in 1956. It can be seen that the potential of wooden sailing ships is great, and the problem lies in how to tap the existing transportation potential.

    充分利用木帆船的运输力量
    袁星南
    在我国内河航运事业中，木帆船为数众多，分布很广，运量也较大，它能深入河流沿岸的广大农村，为城市和轮船、火车集散货物，给城乡物资交流上构成了一个运输网。
    据1956年不完全统计，全国内河专业木帆船约二十四万多只，载重二百七十六万多吨，从业人员和家属达三百万人左右。1956年年末，预计完成货运量占全国地方内河总运量的82.25％，周转量为63.96％。完成的运量比1952年增长一点一二倍。此外，沿河的农村里还有大量副业船只，仅江苏、浙江省的副业船就约有七万七千多只。这些民船，在今后相当长的时期内还是一支不可忽视的运输力量。特别是专业船只在去年基本上已经实现了合作化，在运输中起着积极作用。
    去年在内河运输战线上出现了一个新的情况，就是运输物资激增，运输力量普遍感到不足。河北省去年托运量比运输生产计划多出约达八十多万吨。江苏省去年8月份托运物资比1955年同期增加38％，9月份增加47％，10月份增加49％，11月份又较10月份增长26％。辽宁省去年上半年运输物资比1955年同期增长近三倍。由于运输紧张，每月都有大量物资无力承运，物资积压十分严重。
    但是，另一方面，木帆船运输效率却没有得到应有的发挥。从1956年全国地方内河预计完成情况与1955年相比较，周转量仅增加3.6％。每吨船的年产量约达二千四百二十吨公里，平均每吨船一天只能航行六公里多。其中如四川平均吨船年产量为三千三百零四吨公里；山东国营木帆船吨船年产量为七千一百三十吨公里。但有些省平均每吨船年产量只有一千七百吨公里左右，还有许多副业船利用得更差。
    由于木帆船运用效率低，加之有些合作社的经营管理还存在着不少问题。运价低，有些社的生产下降，直接影响到船工船民的收入。因此，有些船民产生消极情绪，认为搞运输不比农业好。发生要求退社、转业的现象。
    木帆船所以没有得到充分利用，固然有一些客观因素，如水枯、冰冻、港口堵塞、修船材料供应不及时等等。但主要是航运部门在运输组织上残存着“重轮轻木”的片面看法，因此有些地区虽然名义上在管，实际只限于一般分配货运、收收管理费。还有的对货运采取先国营、后公私合营、再合作社营的做法。例如广东松口港木帆船本来已经装好货准备开船，但是因为国营船无货，硬把木帆船上装好的粮食卸下一部分给国营船运，引起社员不满。还有的盲目追求国营计划的完成，而排挤木帆船。如珠江航运局去年对国营轮驳船运输计划编得多，木帆船编得少。广西部分驳船的运量已经达到1955年的167.02％，周转量为152.71％；木帆船运量则下降为63.03％，周转量为47.08％，甚至降到36.77％。因此个别地区的船民许久没有货运，不得不上山打柴维持生活；个别的地区认为木帆船“落后”、“过剩”，组织木帆船转业。这样就大大增加轮船和其他运输工具的负担，影响到物资的畅通。
    一年来运输战线上的紧张状况，对航运部门的压力很大，但是组织社会运输力量的工作，不仅没引起应有的重视，而且压低木帆船效率的现象益趋严重。在有些省今年编制的运输计划中，轮驳船运量计划较上年度增加28.6％，周转量增加40％，而木帆船运量增加14.6％，周转量降低为9.9％，还有的地区甚至比1956年减低8％以上。
    四川、山东等省木帆船的潜力很大。四川的木帆船平均每吨船年产量是三千三百多吨公里，今年计划提高为三千六百七十六公里，如果试把每吨船的年产量提高到四川省的水平，则每吨船年产量可增加八百八十吨公里，全国内河一年可多给国家完成货运周转量二十四亿二千八百八十万吨公里，相当于1956年全国地方内河轮驳船完成周转量的总和。可见木帆船潜力是大的，问题在于如何挖掘现有的运输潜力。
