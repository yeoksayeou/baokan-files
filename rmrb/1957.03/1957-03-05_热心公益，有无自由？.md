Zealous for Public Welfare, Is There Freedom?
    Xiao Qian

    In capitalist countries, how wide is the scope of freedom, really? The recent ruling by the London High Court on the disposition of George Bernard Shaw's estate gives us some inspiration.

    Shaw worked diligently his entire life, earning a sum of money from royalties and performance fees. In his will, the old man, besides leaving some alimony for a few elderly relatives, donated the remaining £700,000-plus entirely, specifying that it be used for research and reform of the English alphabet. He was, after all, familiar with the stubbornness of British conservative forces, so after expressing this wish, he added a supplement, saying that if this ideal could not be realized, then the money should be divided equally among three academic institutions (the National Gallery of Ireland, the British Museum, and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art).

    No sooner had the old man been buried than the lawsuit began. The plaintiffs were the three academic institutions; the defendant, precisely Shaw's innocent will. The lawsuit lasted for more than six years, and the verdict was handed down late last month: the "will" lost the case, and a brave ideal of Shaw's during his lifetime was defeated. Afterwards, the judge even rebuked the "defendant" for violating the sacred laws of the British Empire. Some hangers-on also indirectly described the writer's sincere wish as a "prank" and a "ghost trick."

    Why was Shaw so enthusiastic about the reform of the English alphabet? Because he felt that the twenty-six letters of the English alphabet were insufficient, so some sounds had to be spelled with two letters, which was not only awkward to learn but also troublesome to write. This unreasonable spelling naturally greatly hindered the popularization of culture—30% of the British population is still semi-literate. If more letters were used to replace the current letters, it would greatly "save time, effort, and money" for the masses of people in learning and using the written language. According to Shaw's discussions with some experts, adding only fourteen more letters would achieve "one sound, one letter."

    The question is not whether his view is correct or not. Shaw did not ask the British Ministry of Education to issue a notice changing anything; he simply wanted to use the money he had worked so hard to earn in his life to promote this academic research, hoping that one day he could realize this greatest aspiration of his life—the soul of this aspiration being his concern for people. What surprises us is that such a wish, which did not touch a single hair of the ruling class, was so mercilessly criticized by the judge.

    From this incident, we see how unpopular any rationalization proposal—that is, an idea that changes the status quo—is in that kind of country. At the same time, we can also see that despite their boasting of "freedom," even a master of the theater world could not enjoy a bit of freedom to be "zealous for public welfare" after his death!

    热心公益，有无自由？
    萧乾
    在资本主义国家里，自由的尺度到底有多宽呢？最近伦敦高等法院对萧伯纳遗产支配问题的判决多少给了我们一些启发。
    萧伯纳一生辛勤劳动，连版税带上演税挣下了一笔钱。老头子在遗嘱里除了给几个年迈的亲属留下点赡养费以外，其余的七十多万镑扫数捐献出来，并且指定要花在研究并改革英文字母的用途上。他对英国保守势力的顽固毕竟是熟悉的，所以在表示了自己的这个愿望以后，又作了个补充，说万一这个理想不能实现，那么，这笔款子就由三个学术团体（爱尔兰国家绘画馆、英国博物馆和皇家戏剧学院）平分。
    老头子刚入土，官司就打起来啦。原告是那三个学术团体；被告呢，正是萧伯纳那份无辜的遗嘱。官司一直打了六年多，上月下旬宣判了，“遗嘱”败了诉，萧伯纳生前的一个勇敢的理想败了诉。事后，法官还申斥“被告”违反了大英帝国的神圣法律。一些帮闲者又旁敲侧击地把作家这个真挚的愿望说成是“恶作剧”和“鬼把戏”。
    萧伯纳为什么对英文字母的改革这样热心呢？因为他感到英文的二十六个字母不够使用，因而有些音必须用两个字母拼起来，不但学起来别扭，写起来也费事。这种不合理的拼音法自然大大不利于文化的普及——英国目前仍然有30％人口是半文盲。如果用较多的字母来代替目前的字母，就会使人民群众在学习和使用文字时大大“节省时间、劳力和金钱”。据萧伯纳跟一些专家的探讨，只要再加上十四个字母，就可以做到“一个音一个字母”了。
    问题不在于他这个看法对不对。萧伯纳并没要求英国教育部出告示改变什么，他只是想用自己一生辛辛苦苦挣的钱，来促进这种学术研究，希望有一天能实现他一生这个最大的抱负——这个抱负的灵魂正是他对人的关怀。使我们惊讶的是，这样一个没触到统治阶级一根汗毛的愿望，竟然遭到了法官先生无情的批驳。
    从这件事我们看到任何合理化建议——也就是改变现状的想法，在那样的国家里有多么不吃香，同时，也可以看到尽管他们满口标榜着“自由”，而一代剧坛大师死后居然连一点“热心公益”的自由也享受不到！
