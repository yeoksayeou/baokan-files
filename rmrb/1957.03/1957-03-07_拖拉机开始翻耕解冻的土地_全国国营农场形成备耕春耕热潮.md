Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: Workers at national state farms across the country are intensifying preparations for this year's spring plowing to strive for a bumper harvest. Spring plowing has already begun in state farms in the Yangtze River basin and the southern provinces.

In Hubei Province, the Wusan, Caobuhu, and five other mechanized farms have collectively deployed more than 140 tractors (calculated as standard units) in recent days to till spring land. Some farms have already finished plowing and are leveling the land, preparing to sow cotton in late March. This year, the seven farms will plant over 52,000 mu of cotton, over 43,000 mu of rice, over 32,000 mu of soybeans, and over 16,000 mu of peanuts. Seeds and fertilizers are all prepared, and all seeds are improved varieties. Cotton seeds are currently being fumigated with chemicals. In order to reduce production costs, since last winter, farm workers have accumulated more than 80 million jin of natural fertilizer, accounting for half of the required amount. In Jiangsu Province, ten state farms are generally plowing or harrowing land, and selecting and mixing cotton seeds with chemicals. The more than 75,000 mu of wheat planted by the farms are growing well, and the farms have also strengthened the management of wheat fields. In Guangdong Province, state farms began spring plowing in late February. Among them, the largest Zhujiang Farm, which mainly grows rice, will plant 18,000 mu of rice this year and has already begun cultivating early rice seedlings. The 2,500 mu of seedling fields will be completed before the 15th. Farms that grow sugarcane are cutting and harvesting old cane while planting new cane. Six sugarcane farms in western Guangdong will newly plant 20,000 mu of sugarcane this year. At the Guangxi State-run Mingyang Farm, plowing and harrowing began in January, and more than 10,000 mu have been plowed and harrowed so far. Farms planting rubber are carrying out tasks such as supporting, fertilizing, weeding, and planting cover crops in the rubber plantations.

State farms in North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China are also stepping up preparations for spring plowing. Among the six state farms in Shandong Province, the Guangbei, Ningyang, Tannan, and Baimahe farms are transporting fertilizer to the spring fields and starting harrowing. In Hebei Province, the Zhongjie Friendship, Qingxian, Jinghai, Guyuan, and Bagezhuang farms are rushing to repair field irrigation projects. Workers at the Junliangcheng Farm plan to convert more than 1,200 mu of dry land in the farm into paddy fields this year in order to increase grain production. The more than 90 state farms in Liaoning Province generally started preparing for spring plowing earlier this year. Machine maintenance and winter training have been completed, and more manure has been prepared than in previous years. All fruit tree farms are pruning fruit trees. At the famous State-run Friendship Farm in Heilongjiang Province, machinery and tools are being repaired urgently, and it is expected that repairs will be completed before March 10. The seeds to be sown this year have all been selected and have undergone two germination tests. Other state-run farms (pastures) in Heilongjiang Province are also preparing to develop large-scale pig farming. In the northern part of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the farms are still covered with snow, but the Aksu Bayi Victory Farm in the south has already begun spring plowing and harrowing. This year, employees of state-run farms (pastures) across the country plan to produce 1.7 to 1.8 billion jin of grain, 300 million jin of soybeans, 450,000 dan of cotton, sell 180,000 fat pigs, and reclaim 6 million mu of wasteland for the country. In order to complete this task, a surge of preparation for spring plowing has been formed in various farms. Employees of state farms in Hubei Province, Guangxi Province, and the State-run Friendship Farm have also launched labor competitions.

    拖拉机开始翻耕解冻的土地
    全国国营农场形成备耕春耕热潮
    据新华社6日讯　全国国营农场的职工都在加紧准备今年的争取大丰收的春耕。长江流域和华南各省的国营农场的春耕已经开始了。
    在湖北省的五三、草埠湖等七个机械农场连日来共出动了一百四十多台拖拉机（按标准台计算）翻耕春地，其中有的农场已经结束了翻土，正在平整土地，准备3月下旬播种棉花。七个农场今年将种植五万二千多亩棉花，四万三千多亩水稻，三万二千亩大豆和一万六千亩花生。现在种子和肥料都已准备好了，种子全部是良种，棉种正在用药剂熏蒸。为了降低生产成本，去冬以来各农场职工共积累了八千多万斤自然肥料，占需用量的一半。在江苏省的十个国营农场普遍在耕地或耙地，选择和用药剂搅拌棉种。各农场所种的七万五千多亩麦子生长很好，各农场也加强了对麦田的管理。在广东省的国营农场2月下旬就开始了春耕。其中以种水稻为主的最大的珠江农场今年要种一万八千亩水稻，已经开始培育早稻的稻秧。二千五百亩秧田15日以前就可作完。种甘蔗的各农场正在一面砍收一面插种新蔗。粤西的六个蔗场今年要新种甘蔗二万亩。在广西省国营明阳农场1月份就开始了耕地耙地，到现在已经耕耙了一万多亩。种植橡胶的各农场正在对胶园作扶育、施肥、锄草、种植覆盖植物等工作。
    华北、东北和西北的国营农场也在加紧准备春耕。山东省六个国营农场中，广北、宁阳、郯南、白马河等四个农场正在向春田运送肥料和开始耙地。在河北省的中捷友谊、青县、静海、沽源、柏各庄等农场正在赶修田间的灌溉工程。军粮城农场的职工为了增产粮食，今年要把场内的一千二百多亩旱地也改成水田。辽宁省的九十多个国营农场今年备耕工作一般动手较早，机器检修和冬训都已经结束，粪肥准备比往年为多。各果树农场都在进行果树剪枝工作。在黑龙江省的著名的国营友谊农场正在加紧检修机具，预计3月10日以前可以检修完毕。今年播的种都已选好，而且作了两次发芽试验。黑龙江省其他各国营农（牧）场还在准备大规模发展养猪。新疆维吾尔自治区北部各农场现在还是一片积雪，但南部阿克苏八一胜利农场已经开始春耕春耙了。今年全国国营农（牧）场的职工，计划要为国家生产粮食十七到十八亿斤、大豆三亿斤、棉花四十五万担，出售肥猪十八万只和开荒六百万亩。为完成这个任务，各地农场已经形成备耕、春耕的热潮。湖北省、广西省各农场和国营友谊农场的员工还展开了劳动竞赛。
