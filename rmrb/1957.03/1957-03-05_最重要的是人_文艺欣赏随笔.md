    The Most Important Thing is People
    ——Essays on Art Appreciation
    Wang Chaowen
    Comrade Zhu Dan, who recently returned to Beijing from Sichuan, happily told me that the old Sichuan opera actor whose stage name is Peng Haiqing, played the villain Xiao Fang in "Da Hong Tai" very realistically. The conversation between this actor and the visitor was also very interesting.
    He said that in his learning years, after playing Xiao Fang once, the teacher asked him: "What did you use to kill people?" He replied: "A wooden knife." The teacher was not satisfied: "No, think again." The next day the teacher asked him again: "What did you use to kill people?" He replied: "A knife." The teacher was still not satisfied: "You are not using your knife to kill people, you must use your heart to kill people."
    Not using a knife but using the heart to kill people, that’s really cleverly said. Hearing this kind of speech, one cannot but admire the experts of traditional opera, who are not only able to freely use performance routines, but also pay attention to "experience," and do know how to "enter the role."
    Because of this, I am reminded of another playwright's view. This is also related to props - the knife, and it is also very interesting: the important thing is not whether Othello's knife is made of cardboard or metal, but whether the actor's own inner feelings used to provide the basis for Othello's suicide are correct, sincere, and true. The important thing is, assuming Othello's living conditions and circumstances are real, and assuming the knife he used to stab himself is real, then how should the actor as a person act. (Stanislavski, "An Actor Prepares," Part One, p. 244 of the Chinese translation)
    These words are all to illustrate the importance of convincingly shaping characters with thoughts and feelings. What is the teacher's name? I hope that in the near future, the names of these old Chinese pioneers who have no written works but are full of creative experience will no longer seem more unfamiliar than the names of foreign playwrights.
    Drama is a bit like magic, using a wooden knife or a cardboard knife to kill or commit suicide, it is clearly a false thing, but it can "deceive" the audience, and treat it as a real thing. But drama is not magic after all. Its most moving power is not to make people frightened and mistaken for a moment, thinking that someone on stage has really died. Rather, it is through the imitation of actions of killing or suicide based on psychological grounds, to introduce the audience to people of a certain character, so that the audience can associate with more people who are spiritually similar to "this one," and further understand the meaning of life. If it is only for temporary spiritual stimulation, then the drama, which should have been a solemn educational tool, may be turned into a kind of vaudeville for entertainment only.
      Excellent Chinese opera actors are a bit like magicians. There are no doors, no stairs, no cars, horses, bridges, boats, no mountains and water on the stage. They rely on mature performance skills to "deceive" the audience before they have time to doubt, and believe that the characters are acting in a specific environment; just as they don't use real knives to kill or commit suicide, the audience also believes it is real. However, Chinese opera actors are not just magicians. Their performance purpose is not to arouse the audience's amazement, admiring their ability to create something out of nothing, and fill the stage with clever performances, like a magician unexpectedly changing many eggs from a thin handkerchief, but to specifically express the spiritual state of those people acting in a certain environment, their happiness and misfortune, joy or pain, good and evil, beauty and ugliness, to help the audience recognize their character and the character of people in real life similar to them, and arouse feelings of envy, regret, hatred, or admiration. If we overemphasize the specificity of the place where the characters act, and let real doors, real horses, real mountains, and real water hinder the actors from shaping the characters, that is not the happiness of the audience.
    The environment of the characters' actions, in good poetry, is not only a foil to the characters' spiritual state, but often, like the performance of excellent opera, it is a depiction colored by the characters' emotions, and a concrete expression of the characters' spiritual state. There are many such expressions in Wang Shifu's "Romance of the West Chamber":
    Facing a dim and flickering short lamp, leaning on a cold and desolate old screen.
    The lamp is dim, the dream cannot be formed; outside the window, the sound of wind
    penetrates the sparse lattice, and the paper strips titter...
    Is this writing scenery? Yes, but it is more than just writing scenery. Like the psychological relationship between the scene of burning the hay yard and the characters in the novel "Water Margin," it does not appear as an independent phenomenon, but rather expresses the spiritual elements of the people through its description.
    If we can say that Chen Miaochang in "Autumn River" is written to describe people through the specific conditions of the boat and river water expressed in her actions, like the scenery description in the above "Romance of the West Chamber," then we not only require the actors to be able to use their performing techniques to reproduce the "invisible" images of the boat and river water that do not exist on the stage. Moreover, and more importantly, it requires the actors to focus on expressing the complex feelings of this girl who is eagerly chasing her lover at this time and place in this performance. Although her anxiety, fear, and pleasure are expressed by her performance - imitating the external characteristics of people in the boat leaning against the shore, swaying, and speeding, and the characteristics of the boat, the purpose is to express the spiritual state of this person and such people.
    The locust tree that appears in the Chu opera "One Hundred Days of Marriage," the Huangmei opera "The Fairy Couple," and the Sichuan opera "The Scholar and the Tree," can be considered a character in a certain sense, and its existence affects the plot. However, I think the importance of its existence lies in facilitating the portrayal of the spiritual outlook of the characters Dong Yong and his wife. Not realistically moving a locust tree onto the stage is not equivalent to deleting a character. But if the actor fails to highlight the psychology and emotions of his contact with the locust tree, the performance of this play will inevitably be unsuccessful.
    In the Chu opera, Dong Yong, whose happy marriage suddenly suffered an unexpected blow, felt helpless, and his grief and anger had nowhere to vent, so he had to vent it on the locust tree. "Locust shade, you shouldn't be a matchmaker, Li Changeng shouldn't be the marriage officiant." It is more of an accusation than a blame. The accused are not the locust tree and Li Changeng who helped them to become a couple, but the accusation of a powerful force that even Dong Yong himself does not quite understand, which has destroyed their happiness. As long as the actor understands the character (Dong Yong and people whose fate is similar to Dong Yong), and has higher skills, even if there is no lifelike locust tree on the stage, the audience cannot but be moved when the actor helplessly calls "dumb wood, dumb wood." Because, in this metaphorical "blame," there is so much misfortune that has not been said directly and is not only encountered by Dong Yong.
    Classical drama that emphasizes characters rather than sets and props, like the paintings of Bada Shanren or Qi Baishi that do not paint backgrounds, is known for its conciseness. It can enable the audience to feel and associate many scenes that do not directly appear in the work from the limited image. It is not that the artist does not have the ability to present all that he has seen, heard, and felt, but that the artist believes that there is no such need, and that sometimes it hinders the art from being art. Being able to fully express the character of the characters is the highest task of all art. It is not difficult to understand that Chinese opera, which focuses on shaping characters realistically and skillfully, does not emphasize sets and props. If the actor's performance lacks character and psychological basis, then the audience who does not regard drama as magic but uses it to understand people will not be forever fascinated by the realistic stars, moon, or lightning on the stage.

    最重要的是人
    ——文艺欣赏随笔
    王朝闻
    新近由四川回京的朱丹同志，很高兴地对我说，艺名叫做彭海清的川剧老演员，在“打红台”中扮演坏人萧方，表演得很真实。这位演员和访问者的谈话，也很有意思。
    他说在他学习的年代，有一次扮演萧方之后，老师问他：“你拿什么东西杀人？”回答道：“木头刀。”老师不满意：“不对，再去想一想。”第二天老师又问他：“你拿什么东西杀人？”回答道：“刀。”老师还是不满意：“你不是用你的刀杀人，你要用你的心去杀人。”
    不是用刀而是用心杀人，说得真聪明。听见这种说话，不能不佩服传统歌舞剧专家们，既能自由运用表演程式，也很讲究“体验”，不是不懂得怎样“进入角色”的。
    由于这，使我想起另外一个戏剧家的见解。这也是和道具——刀有关的，说得也很有意思：重要的并不在于奥瑟罗的刀是硬纸做的还是金属做的，而在于演员本人用来给奥瑟罗的自杀提供根据的内心情感是否正确、诚挚和真实。重要的是，假使奥瑟罗的生活条件和生活情况是真实的，假使他用来刺死自己的刀是真的，那末作为人的演员要怎样行动。（斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基“演员自我修养”中译本第一部第二四四页）
    这些话都是为了说明令人信服地塑造有思想有感情的人物形象的重要性的。这位老师叫什么名字呢？但愿在不久的将来，中国这些虽然没有著书立说、却是满肚子创造经验的老前辈们的名字，不再较之外国戏剧家的名字更令人觉得陌生。
    戏剧真有点像魔术，用木头刀或硬纸做的刀来杀人或自杀，分明是假事情，偏偏能使观众“受骗”，当成是真事情。但戏剧到底不是魔术。它那最动人的力量，不是使人担惊受怕，在一瞬间引起误会，以为台上真有人死了。而是通过有心理根据的杀人或自杀的行动的模仿，给观众介绍一定性格的人，使观众联想到更多的在精神上和“这一个”有相似之处的人们，
  进一步懂得生活的意义。要是仅仅为了精神上一时的刺激，那么，本来应该是庄严的教育工具的戏剧，可能被变成某一种只供娱乐的杂耍。
      优秀的中国歌舞剧演员有点像魔术家。台上没有门，没有楼梯，没有车、马、桥、船，也没有山和水，他们依靠成熟的表演技巧，使观众来不及怀疑就受了“骗”，相信角色是在某种具体环境中行动着；正如不用真刀杀人或自杀，观众也相信是真的一样。可是，中国歌舞剧演员不就是魔术家。他们的表演目的不是为了引起观众的惊叹，佩服他们能够无中生有，用巧妙的表演把舞台充实起来，像魔术师出人意料地从薄薄的手巾中变出许多鸡蛋那样，而是为了把那些在一定环境中行动着的人的幸与不幸，欢乐或痛苦，善与恶，美与丑的精神状态具体表现出来，帮助观众认识他和他相似的现实生活中的人们的品格，引起羡慕、惋惜、憎恨或钦佩的感情。要是过分强调人物活动场所的具体性，让真门、真马、真山、真水妨碍演员塑造人物，那不是欣赏者的幸福。
    人物行动的环境，在好的诗词里，它不只是人物的精神状态的衬托，而且，常常像卓越的歌舞剧的表演那样，是染上了人物情绪的色彩描写，是人物的精神状态的一种具体表现。王实甫的“西厢记”里就有许多这种表现：
    对着盏碧荧荧短檠灯，倚着扇冷清清旧帏屏。
    灯儿又不明，梦儿又不成；窗儿外淅零零的风儿
    透疏棂，忒楞楞的纸条儿鸣……
    这是写景吗？是的，却不止于是写景，如同小说“水浒”里火烧草料场的景色与人物的心理关系一样，它不是以独立的现象出现的，而是通过它的描写来表现人的精神的因素。
    如果可以说“秋江”中的陈妙常由行动中所表现出来的船及江水的具体状况和上述“西厢记”中的景色描写一样是为了写人的，那么，我们不只要求演员能够用他们的表演技术，把并不存在于台上的船和江水以“无形”的形象再现到台上来。而且，更主要的是，要求演员在这种表演里，着重表现这一个急切地追赶情人的姑娘在此时此地的复杂心情。虽然她的着急、恐惧和愉快是由她的表演——模仿了处在靠着岸的、动荡着的和急驰着的船里的人的外形特点和船的特点来表现的，目的却在于表现这一个人和这样的人们的精神状态。
    出现在楚剧“百日缘”、黄梅剧“天仙配”以及川剧“槐荫记”里的那棵槐树，在一定意义上看来，它也可以算是一个角色，它的存在影响情节。可是，我以为它存在的重要性在于有利于人物董永及其妻的精神面貌的刻画。不如实地搬一棵槐树上台，不等于删去一个角色。而演员不能把他和槐树接触时的心理、情绪突现出来，这个戏的表演就不免是不成功的。
    楚剧里美满姻缘突然遭受了意外的打击的董永，感到无援，满腔悲愤无处发泄，只得向槐树发泄。“槐荫你不该为媒证，李长庚不该来主婚”。与其说这是责备，不如说是控诉。被控诉的不是帮助他们成配的槐树和李长庚，而是控诉连董永自己也不很明白的一种强大的破坏了他俩的幸福的力量。只要演员理解人物（董永与董永的命运相似的人们），而且拥有较高技巧，台上虽然没有一棵逼真的槐树，当演员无可如何地叫“哑木头，哑木头”的时候，观众不能不激动。因为，这种借题发挥的“责备”里，包含着多少没有直说出来而且不只董永一人才遭遇着的不幸。
    不强调布景和道具而强调人物的古典戏剧，像不画背景的八大山人或齐白石的画那样，以简练见长。它能够使欣赏者从有限的形象感到和联想到许多不直接出现在作品中的景象。并不是艺术家没有本领把所见、所闻和所感的都和盘托出，而是艺术家认为没有这种必要，认为这样有时反而妨碍了艺术之所以成其为艺术。能够充分表现人物性格，才是一切艺术的最高任务。以真实而又巧妙地塑造人物为主的中国歌舞剧，它不着重布景和道具是不难了解的。如果演员的表演缺乏性格和心理的根据，那么，不把戏剧当成魔术而是为了借此认识人的观众，不会永远被台上逼真的星星、月亮或闪电所魅惑。  1956年12月20日
