I am participating in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference for the first time, and I feel extremely honored and happy to attend this conference. What excites me most is that I heard Chairman Mao's important twelve instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people at the Supreme State Conference. On the opening day, I also heard Premier Zhou's report on his visit to eleven Asian and European countries, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference over the past year, and at the preparatory meeting, I listened to Vice Premier Li's explanation of some issues concerning the Second Five-Year Plan, which made me deeply realize the superiority and democracy of our country's political system. In the small group discussions, we discussed everything we knew and said everything we could, and further learned that the development of heavy industry, agriculture, and light industry in building a socialist society are interconnected and mutually restrictive, and there should be no bias. These great measures of the Central Committee are correct and timely, and I express my heartfelt support and hope that they will be earnestly implemented. I am a Taoist, and I would like to give a brief introduction to the origin and evolution of Taoism at this conference. I declare in advance that I am not promoting it. Taoism is China's inherent religion, that is, China's ancient religion. Its beginning was due to the gradual evolution of primitive society's worship of all things to the worship of ancestors. The so-called worship of all things is like "the Xiahou clan used pine, the Yin people used cypress, and the Zhou people used chestnut"; ancestor worship is "the Son of Heaven had seven temples, the feudal lords had five temples, the senior officials had three temples, the scholars had two temples, and the common people worshiped in the bedroom (commonly known as the family hall)." At that time, the people's knowledge was simple, and they thought that all kinds of changes in the world, such as wind, clouds, thunder, rain, mountains, rivers, plants, trees, rivers, lakes, and seas, were governed by gods. Later, it evolved into personal gods, such as Suirenshi as the god of the stove, Zhurongshi as the god of fire, Yao, Shun, and Yu as the Three Officials, the three mothers of the Zhou Dynasty as the Niangniang gods, God in heaven, and the god of the land, most of which were formed to commemorate the achievements of some great men and inventors. The Book of Rites once said: "Those who have contributed to the country are sacrificed, those who have benefited the people are sacrificed, those who can defend against major disasters and resist great difficulties are sacrificed, and those who legislate for future generations are sacrificed." These were all feudal emperors who used folk worship to regulate social morality and supplement political deficiencies. The so-called teaching through divine means played a great role in folk beliefs and has continued to this day. The creation of Taoism began with Taoism. Lao Tzu of the Zhou Dynasty wrote eighty-one chapters of the Tao Te Ching, elaborating on the mystery of the Tao, and did not admit that all things in the world were born of gods. He said that there is something mixed and born before heaven and earth, silent, lonely, independent and unchangeable, and can be the mother of the world; he also said that all things are born from being, and being is born from nothing, so Lao Tzu's theory is naive materialism. Taoism also respects Tao and values virtue, with gods being secondary, emphasizing humility, weakness, non-contention, tranquility, inaction, indifference, few desires, success and fame, and retiring, focusing on cultivation and being indifferent to officialdom, such as Fan Li, Sun Wu Zi, Shangshan Sihao, Zhang Liang, and Huang Shigong, all of whom acted according to the doctrines of Taoism. In the Eastern Han Dynasty, Zhang Ling of Chengdu, the eighth-generation grandson of Marquis Liu, began to create Taoism. He cited Lao Tzu as his ancestor and completely incorporated all folk beliefs in gods into Taoism. From then on, believing in gods and cultivating Tao became one. With the changes in society, there were successive generations of successors and successive generations of decline and prosperity, with branches and factions gradually becoming complex, including the Dan Ding school, the Fu Lu school, the Qing Xiu school, the political school, the Quanzhen school, and the Zhengyi school. Some first came out of the world and then entered the world, and some first entered the world and then came out of the world, such as Wei Boyang, Tao Hongjing, Ge Hong, Wei Zheng, Li Mi, and Li Chunfeng. Sometimes they lived in cities, and sometimes they escaped into the mountains. Until the early Yuan Dynasty, Genghis Khan hired the Taoist Qiu Changchun to ask about the art of longevity, and Changchun told him the way of respecting heaven and loving the people, cherishing life and hating killing, and saved the lives of countless people. Taoism is the inherent religion of the Chinese nation. It is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Although it has its ups and downs, folk beliefs have been universal and have never been interrupted. This cannot be denied. In the past, Taoists in the old society were negative and world-weary, holding the idea of ​​keeping to themselves, having no trouble with others, not contending with the world, and not asking about politics, but the politics at that time did not allow you to ask. Since liberation, politics has changed, and society has become bright. After a series of studies and participation in various social activities, Taoists in various places have greatly improved their awareness, reversing their past negative, world-weary, and apolitical thinking, knowing to unite the masses, promote the spirit of loving the motherland, and jointly with the people of the country, they have the right to vote and be elected, have a glorious political position, and can participate in the major affairs of the country. This has never happened in history. What a fortune it is for us to be born in this rare era and to catch up with the great socialist social construction! At the end of 1956, with the call and assistance of the central government, the Preparatory Committee of the China Taoist Association was established, which further encouraged the patriotic ideas of Taoists across the country to strengthen the construction of socialist society, and I myself was elected as the director of the Preparatory Committee. In the future, standing in the religious post, I will unite Taoists across the country, love the motherland, actively participate in socialist construction and the cause of defending world peace, assist the government in implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief, contact Taoists in various places, carry forward the fine traditions of Taoism, abide by the seven principles in the general program of the Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, strengthen my own study, contribute all my strength, and strive for the construction of socialism!

    扭转消极思想  参加社会活动
    岳崇岱的发言
    我是初次参加中国人民政治协商会议，对于参加这次大会，感到万分光荣和愉快。使我最兴奋的是，在最高国务会议上，听到毛主席关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾问题的重要的十二项指示。在开幕那天，又听到周总理访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的国际友谊的报告、陈叔通副主席的中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常委会一年来工作的报告，并在预备会上听取了李副总理关于第二个五年计划的若干问题的说明，使我深深的体会到我们国家政治制度的优越性和民主性。在小组座谈中作到了知无不言言无不尽的讨论，更进一步知道建设社会主义社会发展重工业、农业和轻工业是互相联系的互相制约的，不能有所偏重。中央这些伟大的措施是正确的也是及时的，我表示衷心的拥护并希望认真的贯彻执行。我是一个道教徒，我愿意在这个大会上将道教的起源与沿革作一简略的介绍。我预先声明一下并不是在作宣传。道教是中国的固有的宗教，也就是中国的古教，他的起始是由于原始社会庶物崇拜逐渐演进到宗祖崇拜。所谓庶物崇拜如“夏后氏以松，殷人以柏，周人以栗”；宗祖崇拜即“天子七庙，诸侯五庙，大夫三庙，士人二庙，庶人祭于寝室（即俗称家堂）”。那时，人民知识简单，以为天地间各种变化风云雷雨、山川草木、江河湖海等等皆有神主宰之。以后又演进为人格神，如燧人氏为灶神、祝融氏为火神、尧舜禹为三官大帝、周朝三母为娘娘神、天有上帝、地有社神，大都是为纪念一些伟人和发明创造者的功绩而形成的。礼记上曾这样说：“有功于国则祀之，有益于民则祀之，能捍大灾能御大难则祀之，立法于后世者则祀之。”这些都是封建帝王利用民间的崇拜，借以范卫世道人心补助政治之不足。所谓神道设教，这对民间信仰曾起过很大的作用，至今普遍的绵延未绝。道教的创立起始于道家，周朝的老子著道德经八十一章，阐发道之玄妙，而不承认天地万物是神生的。他说有物混成先天地生、寂兮、寥兮，独立而不改周行而不殆，可以为天下母；又说万物生于有有生于无，所以老子的学说是朴素的唯物论。道家又尊道而贵德，神则次之，尚谦虚、柔弱、不争、清静、无为、淡泊、寡欲、功成名遂身退、偏重于修养而淡于仕进，如“范蠡孙武子商山四皓张良黄石公”等都是依道家的学说立身行事的。到东汉时，有成都张陵，他是留侯八代孙开始创立道教，他引老子为鼻祖，并将民间一切神的信仰完全统纳于道教之内，从此信神与修道化而为一。随着社会的转变，代有传人代有废兴，枝分派别诸渐复杂，其中有丹鼎派、符籙派、清修派、政治派、全真派、正乙派，有先出世而后入世，有先入世而后出世，如魏伯阳、陶宏景、葛洪、魏征、李密、李淳风等，有时遁居城市，有时逸隐山林。迨至元初，成吉思汗曾聘请道士丘长春问长生久视之术，长春则告以敬天爱民、好生恶杀之道，并拯救过无数人民的性命。道教是中华民族固有的宗教，他深入民心，虽时有兴衰，而民间的信仰则是普遍的始终未断，这是不能否认的。而道教徒过去在旧社会时都是消极厌世，抱着独善其身、与人无患、与世无争、不问政治的思想，但那时的政治也不允许您问。自解放后，政治转变了，社会光明了，各地道教徒经过一系列的学习，参加各项社会活动，觉悟都大大的提高了，扭转过去消极厌世、不问政治的思想，知道团结群众、发扬热爱祖国的精神，与全国人民一道同有选举权和被选举权，有光荣的政治立场，并能参与国家的大事。这是历史上从来所没有过的。我们生在这个稀有的时代，赶上伟大的社会主义的社会建设，是何等的幸运哪！在1956年年末，在中央政府号召协助下，成立中国道教协会筹备委员会，这更鼓舞了全国道教徒加强建设社会主义社会的爱国思想，而我本人被推举为筹备委员会的主任。今后我站在宗教岗位上，团结全国的道教徒，爱护祖国，积极参加社会主义建设和保卫世界和平事业，协助政府贯彻宗教信仰自由政策，联系各地道教徒，发扬道教的优良传统，遵守中国人民政治协商会议章程总纲内七项准则，加强自己的学习，贡献出自己一切力量，为建设社会主义而奋斗！（附图片）
