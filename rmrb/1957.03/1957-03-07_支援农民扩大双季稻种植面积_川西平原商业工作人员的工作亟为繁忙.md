Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Electric Dispatch. Commercial workers in the Chengdu Plain are busily preparing various materials to support farmers in realizing their plan to expand the double-cropping rice planting area.

This year, the agricultural cooperatives in the Chengdu Plain plan to plant 730,000 mu of double-cropping rice, a six-fold increase compared to last year. To solve the problem of insufficient draught animal power brought about by the large-scale planting of double-cropping rice, commercial workers in many counties have formed purchasing teams to purchase and organize vendors to transport cattle from cattle-producing areas such as Ya'an, Fuling, Daxian, and Nanchong. Recently, at the Guanghan and Shiban Tan railway stations, the two largest cattle distribution centers in the Chengdu Plain, trains have been arriving daily loaded with cattle. Cattle transactions have also been very active in the eighty-three cattle markets on the plain. It is estimated that more than 19,000 cattle purchased from other areas will participate in spring plowing on the plain this year.

On the seven highways leading from Chengdu to various counties in the Chengdu Plain, groups of cars, carts, and handcarts have also been frequently transporting various chemical fertilizers, new-style agricultural implements, and pesticides to the countryside recently. According to statistics, the total amount of chemical fertilizers, phosphate rock powder, granular fertilizer, and bone meal that has been transported so far is more than 61 million jin, more than 50% more than the same period last year. This year, 2.8 million jin of highly effective urea has also been newly transferred.

The grain department has long since reserved 12 million jin of "Nante No. 1 early rice" and 18 million jin of "Zhechang No. 3 late rice" seeds necessary for farmers to expand double-cropping rice. These improved varieties are now being allocated to various agricultural cooperatives. The supply of these two improved varieties is of great significance to increasing the yield of double-cropping rice in the Chengdu Plain. Last year, some places lacked these two improved varieties when they tried to plant double-cropping rice, so they had to use local varieties instead, resulting in low yields.

Many grass-roots supply and marketing cooperatives, cadres and salesmen responsible for managing production materials have now learned how to use new-style agricultural implements, chemical fertilizers, and pesticide machinery. When farmers go to the supply and marketing cooperative outlets to buy these things, they can also hear the salesperson explain the common sense of application, and they can take it back and use it immediately.

### 支援农民扩大双季稻种植面积  川西平原商业工作人员的工作亟为繁忙

    支援农民扩大双季稻种植面积
    川西平原商业工作人员的工作亟为繁忙
    新华社成都电　川西平原的商业工作人员正忙碌地准备各种物资，支援农民实现扩大双季稻种植面积的计划。
    今年川西平原的农业社计划种植双季稻七十三万亩，比去年增加六倍。为解决大量种植双季稻所带来的牛力缺乏问题，许多县的商业工作人员已组成采购组，分别到雅安、涪陵、达县和南充等产牛区采购和组织商贩贩运。最近，在川西平原的两个较大的耕牛集散地——广汉和石板滩的火车站上，每天都有火车载运耕牛来到这里。平原上的八十三个耕牛市场上，近来耕牛的交易也很活跃。预计今年将有一万九千多条外地购来的耕牛参加平原的春耕。
    在从成都出发通向川西平原各县的七条公路上，最近一个时期，也经常有成群的汽车、板车、架架车赶运各种化学肥料、新式农具、农药械到农村去。据统计，到目前为止已经运到的化学肥料、磷矿粉、颗粒肥和骨粉等共有六千一百多万斤，比去年同期多50％强。今年，还新调入了二百八十万斤肥效很好的尿素。
    粮食部门早就为农民储备了扩大双季稻所必需的一千二百万斤“南特号早稻”和一千八百万斤“浙场三号晚稻”谷种。现在这些良种正在往各农业社调拨。这两种良种的供应对川西平原增加双季稻的产量有很大意义。去年有些地方试种双季稻时因缺乏这两种良种，不得不用土种代替，结果产量不高。
    许多基层供销合作社里负责经营生产资料的干部和售货员，现在已经学会了新式农具、化学肥料和农药药械的使用方法。农民到供销合作社门市部去买这些东西时，可以同时听到售货员讲解应用常识，带回去马上就可以使用。
