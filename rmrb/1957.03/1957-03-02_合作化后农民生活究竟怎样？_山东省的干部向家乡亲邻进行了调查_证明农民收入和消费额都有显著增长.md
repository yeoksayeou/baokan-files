Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 1st. After agricultural cooperation, what is the living condition of the peasants?

    In order to correctly answer this question, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China sent some cadres back to their hometowns to conduct investigations with relatives and neighbors during the Spring Festival.

    Before returning to their hometowns, these cadres often received letters from home complaining about "tight money, tight grain, and difficult life," but the investigation results proved that their living conditions had generally improved significantly. Among the nineteen cooperative members surveyed, there were ten old middle peasants, four new middle peasants, and five poor peasants. In 1936 before the War of Resistance Against Japan, their average income per capita was 57.64 yuan, and the average consumption was 54.33 yuan; in 1949, the average income was 69.49 yuan, and the average consumption was 65.49 yuan (the amounts for 1936 and 1949 were converted according to the 1956 physical prices); and last year, the average income per person was 73.36 yuan, an increase of more than 27% compared with 1936, and the average consumption per person was 68.16 yuan, an increase of more than 25% compared with 1936. Among the nineteen peasant households, fifteen households saw significant increases in both income and consumption in 1956 compared to before the war, one household saw an increase in income and a slight decrease in consumption, and only three households saw decreases in both income and consumption due to rapid population growth or the loss of labor after joining the cooperative after previously hiring labor. In 1936, only six of these households had a surplus after offsetting income and expenditure, while last year fifteen households had a surplus.

    Another manifestation of improved living conditions is that the proportion of grain consumption in total consumption is gradually decreasing, while the proportion of other consumer goods is gradually increasing. In 1936, the grain consumption expenditure of these nineteen households accounted for 64.57% of the total consumption expenditure, which decreased to 59.01% in 1949, and only accounted for 50.36% last year. In 1936, only one household had grain consumption expenditure accounting for less than 50% of the total consumption expenditure, in 1949 there were only five households, and last year there were ten households. In last year's expenditure items of each household, there can be seen expenditure items such as thermos bottles, flashlights, woolen clothes, cigarettes, sneakers, stoves, coal, bicycles, etc. that did not exist in the past. The consumption of cotton cloth, meat, and cooking oil has also increased a lot compared to the past. Zhao Yude (a poor peasant), a member of the Heshun Agricultural Cooperative in Jiyang County, had always been unable to make ends meet. Last year, after the primary cooperative was transformed into an advanced cooperative, the family's income was more than 560 yuan, and they bought two woolen clothes, two flashlights, and a thermos bottle. The annual consumption increased by 11% compared with 1955, and there was still a surplus of more than 80 yuan at the end of the year.

    Although the proportion of grain consumption in total consumption has decreased, the per capita ration still maintains a considerable amount. Last year, the average per capita ration of these nineteen cooperative members was 438.8 jin, a decrease of 28.8 jin compared to 1949, and an increase of 26.4 jin compared to 1936. Moreover, it can be seen from the survey of these cooperative members that as long as the average per capita has 420 jin of grain (including tubers), it can not only guarantee the per capita ration needs, but also have a surplus.

    合作化后农民生活究竟怎样？
    山东省的干部向家乡亲邻进行了调查  证明农民收入和消费额都有显著增长
    新华社济南1日电  在农业合作化以后，农民的生活状况究竟怎样？
    为了正确的解答这个问题，中共山东省委在春节期间派出一些干部，回到家乡向亲邻进行了调查。
    这些干部在回乡以前，常常接到家里来信诉说“钱紧、粮紧、生活困难”，可是调查结果证明，他们的生活状况大都有了显著改善。在调查的十九户社员中，有十户老中农、四户新中农和五户贫农，他们在抗日战争前的1936年，每口人的平均收入是五七点六四元，平均消费额是五四点三三元；1949年的平均收入是六九点四九元，平均消费额是六五点四九元（1936年和1949年的金额都是按1956年实物价格折算的）；而在去年，每人平均收入是七三点三六元，比1936年增长27％强，每人平均消费额是六八点一六元，比1936年增长25％强。在十九户农民中，1956年收入和消费额都比战前显著增加的有十五户，收入增加，消费额略为减少的有一户，只有三户因为人口增长太快，或是战前有雇佣劳动，入社后又丧失了劳动力，而收入、消费都有减少。1936年，这些农户中收支相抵尚有节余的只有六户，去年有十五户有了节余。
    生活状况改善的另一个表现，是粮食消费在总消费额中所占比重逐渐下降，其它消费用品所占比重逐渐增长。1936年，这十九户的粮食消费支出占总消费金额的64.57％，1949年下降到占59.01％，而去年只占50.36％。1936年，粮食消费支出占总消费金额50％以下的只有一户，1949年只有五户，而去年就有十户。在去年的各户支出项目中，可以看到过去没有的热水瓶、手电筒、绒衣、纸烟、球鞋、火炉、煤炭、自行车等等开支项目。棉布、肉、食油的消费量，也比过去增加了很多。济阳县合顺农业社社员赵玉德（贫农），历年来都是入不敷出，去年由初级社转入高级社后，全家收入五百六十多元，买了两件绒衣、两个手电筒、一个热水瓶，全年消费额比1955年增加了11％，年终还有八十多元的节余。
    粮食消费在总消费额中所占比重虽然下降了，但是每人的口粮还仍然保持着相当的数量。去年，这十九户社员的每人口粮平均是四三八点八斤，比1949年减少了二八点八斤，比1936年多了二六点四斤。而且从这些社员的调查中可以看出，只要每人平均有四百二十斤粮食（包括薯类），就不仅可以保证每人的口粮需要，而且有余。
