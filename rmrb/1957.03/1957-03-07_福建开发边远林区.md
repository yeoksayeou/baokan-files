Xinhua News Agency Report: This year, Fujian's forestry areas will newly build and expand twenty-eight logging yards with an annual output of 15,000 cubic meters of timber. The planned new logging yards are mostly located in remote state-owned forest areas of Wuyi Mountain and Daiyun Mountain. The planned expansion of the logging yards will involve adding chutes, windlasses, and wooden railways to gradually penetrate into remote forest areas that were previously sparsely logged or unlogged.

    福建开发边远林区
    据新华社讯　福建林区今年要新建和扩建二十八个年产一万五千立方公尺木材的采伐场。计划新建的采伐场大部分布在武夷山和戴云山偏僻的国有林区。计划扩建的采伐场，将增辟滑运、辘道和木轨道，逐步深入到过去少伐和未伐的偏僻林区。
