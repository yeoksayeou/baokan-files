　　I completely agree with the various reports presented at the conference.

　　Chairman Zhou Enlai gave a report on international goodwill visits at the conference. The trip of Chairman Zhou and Vice Premier He Long played a significant role in easing international tensions and strengthening mutual understanding and trust among countries. The various high honors that the motherland has obtained internationally give us even greater encouragement.

　　On the eve of the opening of the conference, we had the honor of participating in the enlarged Supreme State Conference. We listened to Chairman Mao's important speech on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." Chairman Mao's instructions gave us great inspiration in understanding and analyzing problems, and we felt very excited. Chairman Mao raised the issue that industrialists and businessmen should continue to strengthen their reform and study, which shows the Party and the leader's unparalleled care for us. 1956 was a year of leap-forward progress for the reform of capitalist industry and commerce. Since the implementation of joint state-private ownership of entire industries, industrialists and businessmen have been accepting reform with joy and pleasure. Under the leadership and education of the Party and the government, the active unity of the working class, the encouragement of public opinion and leaders, everyone has further clarified their future and grasped their destiny, thus setting off a surge of participation in socialist competition and a desire for learning. Taking Shandong as an example, in terms of socialist competition, incomplete statistics from nine cities including Qingdao and Jinan show that there are a total of 90,127 private personnel, of which 67,939 participated in the competition movement in the third quarter of 1956, including 7,116 who were selected as advanced workers, and 1,682 others who received awards. In terms of learning, according to statistics from seven cities and counties including Jinan and Qingdao, as of February 1956, 4,259 people had participated in study classes. Many private personnel, especially graduates of study classes, have established the idea of taking the enterprise as their home, contributed technology, and given full play to their expertise. Many private personnel have felt satisfied after being arranged, and with a feeling of excitement, they have been very active in improving the relationship between public and private parties, improving relations with employees, improving enterprise management, and participating in social activities. Under the call of the great policy of peaceful reform, the mainstream of the business community is victoriously advancing on the road to socialism! The achievements are certain. But while affirming the achievements, it is undeniable that there are still some problems in the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. In terms of the relationship between public and private parties, some private personnel have developed a sense of pride and complacency since the adjustment of the relationship between public and private parties last year. Their understanding of the combination of enterprise transformation and personal transformation is blurred, and they lack understanding of the long-term nature of ideological transformation, denying the negative side due to their class nature. Some people not only consider themselves wealthy but also consider themselves rare commodities. Some even think that joint enterprise is a complete success and that the transformation is complete. Some people only make suggestions to the public party when things happen, and cannot see their own mistakes. Some people cannot take an active approach to win unity with employees, nor do they change employees' perceptions with practical and good actions. They think that fixed interest is what they deserve and forget that it is the blood and sweat of exploiting workers. They think that the position is assigned by the state, and forget to rely on the working class to do a good job in production, give play to their talents and contribute their strength, but instead are arrogant, self-respecting, and alienated from the masses. And among private parties, they are not convinced by each other, they attack each other, compare their status, compare their treatment, and sue each other to the public party, making the public party representatives in a dilemma. In the previous stage, the public party representatives had a kind of "leftist" sentiment and were unwilling to contact private personnel. Since the adjustment of the relationship between public and private parties, they have focused on unity and relaxed education and transformation, thus showing wavering in their attitude towards private personnel, unable to grasp the spirit of the policy of both unity and struggle, and seeking unity through struggle. The relationship between employees and private parties is beginning to improve, but because the All-China Federation of Trade Unions made educational arrangements for the redemption policy relatively late, some employees are not respectful enough of the powers of private personnel. Because there are many incorrect views and vague ideas among the public and private parties and the employees, it greatly affects the production and operation of the enterprise and the transformation of people. In terms of socialist competition: At present, some private personnel have insufficient understanding of participating in socialist competition, and simply pursue the title of honor. They are happy when they are rated as advanced workers, and even develop a sense of pride. Those who are not rated produce negative emotions and complain that the leadership is bureaucratic and cannot treat them equally with employees. Some enterprises also have disunity among private personnel, between private parties and employees, in order to compete for advanced workers. In addition, some private personnel place themselves outside the competition and treat socialist competition with a negative attitude. Some public party representatives do not provide enough support and assistance in promoting the participation of private personnel in socialist competition. In individual enterprises, there are still problems in the evaluation work, such as some enterprises do not evaluate private management personnel, so they have opinions. There are also enterprise management personnel who participate in the evaluation, but the evaluation conditions are not clear, and the work performance cannot be evaluated. In addition, individual enterprises have high requirements for private personnel in the evaluation, and the same performance can be rated for employees, but not for private personnel, which also exists. Therefore, it has also created some unprincipled differences of opinion, affecting the work. In short, there are still many problems to be solved in the progress. As long as the three parties of public, private, and employees work together, we believe that the problems can be solved and the difficulties can be overcome. Since the high tide, the society's view of industrialists and businessmen has changed, and public opinion is more encouraging and less critical. The China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce have emphasized encouragement in their education of their members for a year, with too little criticism. Therefore, it has fostered the pride of industrialists and businessmen, which is not conducive to transformation. This trend should not be allowed to continue, and this situation should be quickly reversed.

　　Chairman Mao correctly pointed out that industrialists and businessmen should continue to strengthen their transformation. We sincerely support this valuable instruction. In addition to the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association strengthening ideological work for their members, and industrialists and businessmen themselves striving to study, working hard, actively accepting transformation, improving their understanding, and giving play to their talents, we sincerely hope that public party representatives will attach importance to the ideological work of private personnel, bravely shoulder the glorious responsibility of dual transformation, and criticize private personnel when they should be criticized, and encourage them when they should be encouraged. In addition, private personnel's participation in the enterprise's socialist competition is the best way to exercise themselves through work, but the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce at all levels must be responsible for promoting this work. At present, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce at all levels cannot intervene in this work, and it is not linked to the trade unions and administrative departments. Therefore, it is suggested that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce can jointly issue an instruction to closely coordinate this work, in order to mobilize all positive factors to serve socialist construction.

　　Dear members: The success of the peaceful transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in China is a pioneering undertaking in world history. The eyes of the whole world are watching us. Let us unite and work with confidence to do this work better, and go from victory to greater victory! (Attached picture)

### 工商业者应克服骄傲情绪加强改造　苗海南的发言

　　工商业者应克服骄傲情绪加强改造
　　苗海南的发言
    我完全同意大会中的各项报告。
    周恩来主席在会上作了关于国际友好访问的报告。周主席和贺龙副总理此行，对于和缓国际紧张局势和加强各国的相互了解和信任起了重大的作用。祖国在国际间所获得的各种崇高荣誉，更给予我们以莫大的鼓舞。
    在大会开幕前夕，我们光荣的参加了扩大的最高国务会议。听取了毛主席关于“正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的重要讲话。毛主席的指示，使我们对认识问题和分析问题方面获得了莫大启发，感到非常兴奋。毛主席提出了工商业者应继续加强改造和加强学习的问题，这足见党和领袖对我们的无比关怀。1956年对资本主义工商业者改造来说，是一个飞跃突进的一年，自从全行业合营以来，工商业者更以欢欣愉快的心情来接受改造，在党和政府的领导教育下，工人阶级的主动团结下，社会舆论和首长的鼓励下，大家进一步明确了前途，掌握了命运，因而掀起了参加社会主义竞赛和要求学习的热潮。就山东来说，在社会主义竞赛方面，青岛、济南等九个城市不完整的统计，共有私方人员九万零一百二十七人，在1956年第三季度参加竞赛运动的计有六万七千九百三十九人，其中被评选为先进工作者的有七千一百十六人，其他获得奖励的人有一千六百八十二人。学习方面，据济南、青岛等七个市县统计，到1956年2月已有四千二百五十九人参加过讲习班学习，许多私方人员特别是讲习班结业的都树立了以企业为家的思想，贡献了技术、发挥了专长。许多私方人员在得到安排后都感到满意，都以感奋的心情，对改善公私共事关系，改善同职工的关系，改进企业管理和对社会活动等方面都很积极。在伟大的和平改造政策的感召下，工商界的主流正在胜利的向社会主义道路上迈进！成绩是肯定的。但在肯定成绩的同时，无可讳言，资本主义工商业改造工作中仍有些问题。在公私共事关系方面，目前某些私方人员自从去年调整公私共事关系以来，便滋长了骄傲自满的情绪，对结合企业改造进行个人改造认识模糊，对思想改造的长期性缺乏认识，否认由于阶级本性而具有的消极一面。有的人不但动辄以财富自居还以奇货可居。甚至认为企业合营万事大吉，改造到顶。有的人遇事只向公方提意见，看不见自己的错误。有的人对职工方面不能以积极靠拢的态度争取团结，也不以实际良好行动改变职工的观感，认为定息是分所应得而忘记了是剥削工人的血汗，认为职位是国家所派，而忘记了依靠工人阶级搞好生产，发挥才能贡献力量，反而自尊自大，脱离群众。而私私之间，互不服气，互相倾轧，比地位，比待遇，互相向公方告状，使公方代表左右为难。而公方代表在前一阶段，有一种“左”的情绪，对私方人员，不愿接触。自从调整公私共事关系以来，又偏重于团结方面，而放松了教育改造，从而对待私方人员的态度上表现了左右摇摆，掌握不住又团结、又斗争，以斗争求团结政策精神。职工与私方关系方面，虽正在开始好转，因为全国总工会对赎买政策的教育布置较晚，故有些职工对私方人员的职权有些不够尊重。由于公私双方和职工群众存在着以上许多不正确的看法和模糊思想，大大地影响到企业的生产经营和人的改造。在社会主义竞赛方面：目前有些私方人员对参加社会主义竞赛认识不足，只是单纯为了追求光荣称号，评上了先进工作者的便高兴，甚而滋长骄傲情绪，评不上的便产生消极情绪，埋怨领导上官僚主义，不能和职工一视同仁。也有的企业私方人员之间、私方与职工之间，为了争选先进工作者，而闹不团结。另外有的私方人员把自己置身于竞赛之外，以消极的态度对待社会主义竞赛。有的公方代表对推动私方人员参加社会主义竞赛工作，支持和帮助不够。在个别企业，评比工作中也还存在着问题，如有的企业对私方管理人员就不进行评比，因而他们有意见。也有的企业管理人员虽参加评比，但评选条件不明确，工作成绩无法评定。另外个别企业在评比中对私方人员要求的高，同样的成绩职工能评上，而私方人员评不上的现象，也是存在的。因此也就造成了些无原则的意见分歧，影响了工作。总之，前进中有待处理的问题还是不少的，只要我们公、私、职工三方面共同努力，我们相信问题是能够解决的，困难是能够克服的。自高潮以来社会上对工商业者看法不同了，群众舆论也是鼓励多而批评少。民建和工商联组织对自己成员的教育，一年以来都强调了以鼓励为主，批评的太少。因而助长了工商业者骄傲情绪，这对改造是不利的。此风不可长，这种情况应该迅速加以扭转。
    毛主席正确的指出了工商业者应继续加强改造，这个宝贵的指示，我们热诚拥护。除了工商联、民建组织应该加强对自己的成员的思想工作和工商业者自身努力学习、努力工作，积极接受改造，提高认识，发挥才能外，我们诚恳的希望公方代表重视私方人员思想工作，勇敢负起双重改造的光荣责任，对私方人员该批评的批评，该鼓励的鼓励。此外私方人员参加企业社会主义竞赛，是通过工作锻炼自己的最好方法，但须各级工商联负责推动这一工作。现在各级工商联对这一工作插不上手，与工会、行政方面都挂不上钩，因此建议全总与全联是否可以联合下达一指示，抓紧配合这一工作，以利于动员一切积极因素为社会主义建设服务。
    各位委员：中国资本主义工商业和平改造事业的成功，是世界历史上的创举。全世界人的眼睛都在看着我们。让我们团结起来信心百倍地更好地作好这一工作，从胜利走向更大的胜利！（附图片）
