　　Don't Stop Eating for Fear of Choking
    Recently, I visited the newly built Hunan Bacterial Fertilizer Plant with great interest. It is said that this factory is the most well-equipped among the few bacterial fertilizer plants in the country, and it can produce rhizobium for 10 million mu of green manure crops every year. The establishment of this factory will play a significant role in solving the current shortage of fertilizer in rural Hunan and ensuring a bumper harvest.
    However, this factory has encountered misfortune. This year, they only plan to produce rhizobium for more than 600,000 mu of green manure crops and free-living nitrogen-fixing rhizobium for 30,000 mu of peanuts. This output is disproportionate to its production capacity.
    Why not maximize the factory's production capacity? Is it not needed? No, that's not the case. It turns out that after the Provincial Department of Agriculture failed to promote the Aomori No. 5 improved variety and the double-wheel double-blade plow last year, it developed a negative sentiment of shrinking back from technological reforms. It is right to learn from failures and move forward steadily, but it is wrong to become passive because of this. Green manure rhizobium has been promoted by the Provincial Agricultural Research Department for many years, and experience has proven that it can increase the fresh grass yield of green manure crops by two to three times. Hunan has more than 5 million mu of green manure crops. If all of them use rhizobium, the output of green manure crops will be greatly increased. Chaling County has proposed a request to supply bacterial agents for 100,000 mu of fields. Last year, the factory also successfully trial-produced free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station applied free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria to one-tenth of a mu of late rice and increased production by 8.9%. This fertilizer is easy to use and inexpensive, costing only a few cents per mu, and there are conditions for its promotion in rural Hunan. We should not "be bitten by a snake once and be afraid of eels for ten years." In order to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture, I hope that relevant departments will find ways to utilize this production potential.

　　不要因噎废食
    最近，我抱着极大的兴趣参观了新建的湖南细菌肥料厂。据说这个厂在全国仅有的几个细菌肥料厂中，设备是最完善的，每年可生产供一千万亩绿肥作物使用的根瘤菌。这座工厂的建立，对于解决目前湖南农村肥料不足，保证农业的大丰收，将会起很大的作用。
    但是，这个厂遇到了厄运。他们今年只计划生产供六十多万亩绿肥作物使用的根瘤菌和供三万亩花生地使用的自生固氮根瘤菌。这点产量，同它的生产能力是不相称的。
    为什么不尽量发挥这个厂的生产能力呢？是不需要吗？不是的。原来省农业厅去年推广青森五号良种、推广双轮双铧犁失败以后，产生了对技术改革退缩不前的消极情绪。从失败中吸取教训稳步前进，是应该的，但因此就消极不前，就不对了。绿肥根瘤菌已经经过省农业研究部门推广过多年，经验证明，它能使绿肥作物——鲜草收获量增加到两三倍。湖南有绿肥作物五百多万亩，如果全部都用上根瘤菌，将大大增产绿肥作物。茶陵县已提出供应十万亩田使用菌剂的要求。去年这个厂也试制成功了自生固氮菌。省农业试验总站在十分之一亩的晚稻里施用了自生固氮菌，就增产了8.9％。这种肥料使用方便，价格低廉，每亩只花几分钱就行了，在湖南农村是有推广条件的。我们不应该“一次被蛇咬，十年怕黄鳝”。为了争取农业大丰收，希望有关部门设法利用这一个生产的潜力。    黄远溟
