Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 10th: Stockholm dispatch: After three days of competition in the team events of the 24th World Table Tennis Championships, the situation in the four men's groups and three women's groups is becoming clear. In Men's Group 1, after defeating the Romanian team, the Chinese team defeated its last opponent, the Belgian team, with a score of 5-0, and won the group championship.

In Group 2, the Japanese team played a game against South Vietnam on March 9th that lasted more than three hours before winning 5-3. The South Vietnamese team grasped the Japanese team's characteristics of being good at fast attacks and fierce shots, trying to slow down the pace of the game and seize the opportunity to attack, so that the Japanese team could not achieve a quick victory. The runner-up in the previous World Singles Championship, Toshiaki Tanaka, lost twice to South Vietnam's Mei Wen and Chen Jingde. Former Japanese runner-up Tsunoda also lost to Chen Jingde. The Japanese team now has seven wins in seven games, the best record in the group. South Vietnam and Sweden both have six wins in seven games.

In Group 3, the Czechoslovakian team has the best record with six wins in six games. The United States team has five wins in six games.

In Group 4, Hungary and Yugoslavia had a fierce battle for nearly four hours on March 9th, and the Hungarian team won 5-3. Hungary's young player Berczik defeated Yugoslavian famous players Vogrincic, Dulin, and Harangozo. The Hungarian team's record is six wins in six games.

The champion of the Women's Team Group 3 was won by the Chinese women's team. After defeating the United States and the United Kingdom, it defeated Norway and Denmark with a score of 3-0.

The champion of the Women's Team Group 1 is the Romanian team, the 1956 world champion.

The Japanese women's team has also won the group championship in Group 2.

    世界乒乓球锦标赛比赛三天
    我国男女队分别获得小组冠军
    据新华社柏林10日电　斯德哥尔摩消息：第二十四届世界乒乓球锦标赛的团体赛经过三天的争夺，现在男子四个组和女子三个组的局势已趋明朗化。男子第一组中，中国队击败罗马尼亚队后，又以五比零击败最后一个对手——比利时队，获得小组冠军。
    第二组中，日本队在3月9日同南越比赛打了三个多小时，才以五比三取得胜利。南越队掌握了日本队善于快攻猛抽的特点，尽量把球赛的速度拉慢下来，并且伺机进攻，使日本队不能速战求胜。上届世界单打亚军田中利明竟两次分别输给了南越的梅文和和陈景德。前日本亚军角田也输给了陈景德。日本队现在是七战七胜，在组中成绩最好。南越队和瑞典队都是七战六胜。
    第三组中，捷克斯洛伐克队六战六胜成绩最好。美国队六战五胜。
    第四组中，匈牙利3月9日同南斯拉夫激战了近四小时，结果匈牙利队以五比三获胜。匈牙利的年轻选手别尔切克击败了南斯拉夫名将沃格林奇、杜利纳和哈兰戈索。匈牙利队的战绩是六战六胜。
    女子团体赛第三组的冠军为中国女子队获得。它在击败了美国队和英国队以后，又以三比零击败了挪威队和丹麦队。
    获得女子团体赛第一组冠军的是1956年世界冠军罗马尼亚队。
    日本女子队在第二组中也已经获得了分组的冠军。
