　  Cannot Turn a Blind Eye

　  The maintenance of equipment and materials at the Zhongmacun Coal Mine's vertical shaft in Henan Province is very poor. As soon as people step into the gate of this engineering office, they find a large seamless steel pipe, 190 centimeters thick, lying in the ditch at the entrance. In a small ditch at the entrance of the workers' dormitory, a hanging hook weighing more than 100 kilograms is half-buried in the soil, covered with a lot of garbage. On the working square of the vertical shaft, machinery and equipment, raw materials, etc., are lying in a mess. Among them, there is a reciprocating water pump with its base buried two or three inches in the soil. There are no fewer than five or six mine cars, tipper trucks, and light steel rails lying upside down. In the construction site's material warehouse, coils of brand-new cables and wire ropes are stacked arbitrarily without padding. Large steel plates more than ten centimeters thick are placed flat on the ground without wooden pads.

　  Another strange thing is that the water discharged from general mines is either clear water or black water, but this mine discharges a stream of milky white water. It turns out that this stream is caused by the cement slurry poured into the shaft wall, and it is difficult to calculate how many tons of cement have been washed out here.

　  The leaders of the Zhongmacun Coal Mine should not turn a blind eye to the waste in the vertical shaft project.

　  不能熟视无睹
    河南省中马村煤矿竖井对设备材料的维护工作很差。当人们刚跨进这个工程处的大门时，就发现门口水沟里躺着一根一百九十公分粗的大型无缝钢管。在工人宿舍门口一条小水沟里，一个重约一百多斤的吊盘挂钩，已经入土半截，上面倒了许多垃圾。在竖井的作业广场上，机器设备、原材料等七躺八倒，其中有往复式水泵一台，机座已经入土二三寸了，矿车、翻斗车、轻钢轨等脚底朝天的也不下五六台。在工地的材料仓库里，一盘一盘簇新的电缆，钢丝绳没有加垫，任意堆放，十多公分厚的大块钢板平放在地面，也不加木垫。
    还有一件奇怪的事，本来，一般矿井排出的水不是清水就是黑水，但是这个矿排出的是一股乳白色的水流，原来这股水流是由于井壁灌水泥浆而冒出的，很难计算这里冲出的水泥究竟是多少吨。
    中马村煤矿的领导者，对竖井工程中的浪费现象熟视无睹，这是不应该的。　　　　吾言
