    Deeply into Simple or Simply into Profound?
    Xiao Shicong
    Several years ago, a comrade told me that before the War of Resistance Against Japan, a magazine in Shanghai published an article discussing popularization, which included a poem (or perhaps it was just a poem):
    Deeply into simple is called popular,
    Simply into simple is called vulgar,
    Deeply into profound is still acceptable,
    Simply into profound is most detestable!
    From that time on, I have firmly remembered this little poem, which is itself an excellent example of deeply into simple, and I have taken it as my motto. I have always maintained a deeply disgusted attitude towards the fourth type, striving not to do such "detestable" things. It has been quite helpful. Sometimes, after reading some articles on the market, I secretly categorize them—of course, there are also some that cannot be managed by these four categories, and I cannot see where they come from or go to. I believe that more than just me have this experience.
    Deeply into simple is the most valuable. To find examples in articles, most of Lu Xun's essays are the best representatives. Zou Taofen's correspondence—especially the part of "萍踪忆语" (Ping Zong Yi Yu, or Wandering Footprints' Memories) that recounts America—can also be considered well-deserved. In speeches, it is generally recognized that Comrade Chen Yun's speeches are one of the most prominent representatives of this type. For more than a decade, he has spoken mostly on financial and market issues, which are inherently the most rigid and boring topics, but he always makes his talks lively and acceptable to everyone.
    There have always been many things of the second type, and there are still many now. Many popular works "simply out" exist, but they have not achieved "deeply in," which commits the fault of the second type.
    The third type: many lengthy papers and many academic works, even if they achieve "deeply in," often commit the fault of "deeply out." Here it says "still acceptable," which means there is still hope. For this type of work, it is best to continue to strive to rise to the first category, whenever it can objectively achieve "simply out."
    Finally, dogmatism, Party stereotypes, deliberate pretension, pretending to know what one doesn't know, treating abuse and intimidation as fighting, etc., probably belong to the fourth category. We are not unfamiliar with this type of thing. Some people can never accept the above criticism, but if it is euphemistically said that their articles are a bit "simply into profound," they may consider it. Therefore, it is convenient to use this phrase to criticize dogmatism, stereotypes, and the like.
    This issue is generally regarded as merely a matter of presentation form and presentation method. My view is slightly different. Except for the third category, "deeply into profound," which can be said to be basically a matter of presentation ability, the rest are issues of the author's cognitive ability and fundamental attitude towards learning and conducting oneself. A true "polymath" will naturally become the first type, a true vulgar person will be content with the second type, and only a hypocritical and pretentious person will specialize in the fourth type—if this fourth type of thing does not disappear, how can science and art flourish? Look at Engels' "Anti-Dühring"; Mr. Dühring, this precious fellow, is a typical representative of this fourth type of person.
    My short article, which only narrates and does not create, is of course in the "simply into simple" category. Fortunately, my purpose is not to enter simply in order to come out profoundly, but only to record it for everyone to use as a reference when writing and composing papers.

    深入浅出乎？浅入深出乎？
    萧时聪
    若干年前，我听见一个同志告诉我，说抗日战争前，上海有一家杂志登过一篇文章，讲通俗化问题，其中有一首诗说（或者就只是一首诗）：
    深入浅出叫通俗，
    浅入浅出叫庸俗，
    深入深出犹可为，
    浅入深出最可恶！
    从那时以后，我就牢牢地记住这首本身就是杰出的深入浅出的小诗，把它作为自己的座右铭。对于第四条始终保持着深恶痛绝的态度，务求不作此种“可恶”的事情。倒也有些帮助。对于市面上的有些文章，有时也在读后暗中加以分类——当然，也还有一些是这四类都管不了的，看不出它的出入何在。有过这种经验的人，想来不止我一个。
    深入浅出是最可贵的，要从文章上找例子，鲁迅的大部分杂文自是最好的代表。邹韬奋的通讯——尤其是记述美国的那部分“萍踪忆语”也可当之而无愧。在讲话中，大家也公认陈云同志的讲演是这种类型的最显著的代表之一，十几年来，他讲的以财经市场问题为多，这本来是最硬性、最枯燥的东西，但他讲出来总是使得四座风生，大家都能接受。
    第二类的东西一直就不少，现在也还很多。不少通俗作品“浅出”则有之，“深入”则没有做到，这就犯了第二条的毛病了。
    第三类，很多长篇论文和很多学术性著作即使做到了“深入”，但也常犯“深出”的毛病。这里说它
  “犹可为”，就是说还有希望。这类著作，凡在客观上能做到“浅出”的，总以继续努力升到第一类为好。
    最后，教条主义、党八股、故意搬弄、强不知以为知、把辱骂和恐吓当作战斗，等等，恐怕要属于第四类了。对这一类的东西我们并不生疏。有些人无论如何是不能接受上述的评语的，但是如果委婉地说他的文章有点“浅入深出”，他也许能考虑。所以用这句话来批评教条、八股一类的东西倒也方便。
    这个问题，一般是仅仅看作一个表现形式问题、表现方法问题的。我的看法稍有不同。其中除了第三类“深入深出”，可以说基本上是表现能力问题外，其余都是作者的认识能力与做人为学的根本态度的问题。真正的“通人”，自会成为第一种，真正的俗人，则安于第二种，惟有虚伪的、矫饰的人，才专搞第四种——这第四种东西不亡，科学、艺术怎能兴旺。看看恩格斯的“反杜林论”，杜林这位宝贝先生，就是这第四种人物的典型代表。
    我的这篇述而不作的短文，当然也是“浅入浅出”一类。好在我的目的不在浅入而深出，记出来不过供大家提笔、论文时作个参考罢了。
