    The Common Aspirations of the Arab People
    The leaders of four Arab countries—Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan—held a meeting in Cairo from February 25 to 27 to discuss issues of common concern to Arab countries and issued a joint communique.
    In the joint communique, the leaders of the four countries reached a consensus on the major and urgent issues currently facing the Middle East. They firmly demanded that the Israeli aggressor troops immediately and unconditionally withdraw from the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba region of Egypt, and advocated that the issue of Palestinian Arab refugees should be properly resolved. They firmly believed that the British, French, and Israeli aggressors should compensate Egypt for its losses in the war, and opposed any attempt to infringe upon Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal. At the same time, they expressed deep sympathy and support for the people of their brotherly countries, Yemen and Algeria, in their struggle against colonialism. The spirit of solidarity and mutual support embodied in the Cairo Four-Nation Summit fully demonstrates the firm will of the Arab countries to safeguard their independence and sovereignty. Because in the long struggle against the colonialists, the Arab people have deeply experienced that only by continuing to strengthen the close unity and cooperation between Arab countries can they have the strength to resist foreign aggression and defend their sovereignty and independence.
    The leaders of the four countries reiterated their determination to protect the Arab world from the harms of the Cold War and adhere to a policy of active neutrality to safeguard the true interests of the Arab countries. They advocated that the defense of Arab countries should be arranged by themselves without participating in any "foreign conventions." The leaders of the four countries also pointed out in the joint communique that their countries are eager to play their role internationally on the basis of contributing to peace, security, and prosperity, and to extend their hands to cooperate with all countries; all countries that wish to be friendly with Arab countries must respect the sovereignty and interests of Arab countries. The Arab countries' adherence to this independent and peaceful neutral position is in line with the common aspirations of the Arab people.
    However, the United States expressed displeasure with the outcome of this meeting. As everyone knows, in order to seize the colonial positions of Britain and France in the Middle East and enslave the people of the Middle East, the United States has recently stepped up its conspiratorial activities in the Middle East. The United States has tried every means to divide the unity of the Arab countries, attempting to use American "aid" to induce some Arab countries to abandon their independent policies and drag them into Western military aggression blocs. The United States has made no secret of its hope to persuade other Arab countries to agree to the "Eisenhower Doctrine" through the King of Saudi Arabia. However, the outcome of the Arab Four-Nation Summit shows that this attempt by the United States has failed. Washington immediately expressed "disappointment" after the release of the joint communique of the Arab Four-Nation Summit that the meeting failed to accept its Middle East aggression plan, which exposed the unease of the U.S. ruling group.
    As can be seen from the communique of the Arab Four-Nation Summit, the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" aggression plan promoted by the United States to the Middle East is completely contrary to the national aspirations of the Arab countries. The United States claims that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is to "protect" the Middle Eastern countries from aggression, but in reality, the United States is protecting the aggressors in the Middle East and expanding its own aggressive forces. Israel's refusal to implement the United Nations resolution requiring it to withdraw its troops should be subject to severe sanctions by the United Nations, but the United States disregarded the proposal of the six Asian-African countries to sanction Israel and unilaterally proposed so-called "guarantees" that would harm Egypt's sovereign interests as conditions for Israel's withdrawal from Egypt. This shows that the United States is actually standing entirely on the side of the aggressor. According to foreign bourgeois news agencies, the United States, France, and Israel have already agreed that the United Nations forces will occupy the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba indefinitely, and that American warships will be stationed in the waters of the Gulf of Aqaba to "guarantee" so-called "free navigation." And at this time, two American destroyers have already appeared in the Red Sea. Obviously, the United States is attempting to continue to use Israel to threaten the peace and security of the Arab world and put pressure on Egypt and the Arab countries in order to promote the "Eisenhower Doctrine" aggression plan in the Middle East.
    The Arab Four-Nation Summit's agreement on various issues of common concern and further strengthening of unity and cooperation within the Arab countries is not conducive to colonial countries that harbor aggressive ambitions toward the Middle East. All efforts made by the Arab countries to realize these just demands will receive strong support from Asian and African countries and peace-loving countries and people all over the world.

### 阿拉伯人民的共同愿望

    阿拉伯人民的共同愿望
    埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯和约旦四个阿拉伯国家的领导人，2月25日到27日在开罗举行会议，讨论了阿拉伯国家共同有关的问题，并发表了联合公报。
    四国领导人在联合公报中对中东地区的当前重大的迫切问题取得了一致意见。他们坚决要求以色列侵略军立即无条件地从埃及的加沙地带和亚喀巴湾地区撤出去，主张巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯难民问题应当得到妥善的解决。他们坚决地认为，英法和以色列侵略者应该赔偿埃及在战争中的损失，并且反对任何侵犯埃及对苏伊士运河的主权的企图。他们同时还对他们的兄弟之邦也门和阿尔及利亚人民反抗殖民主义的斗争，表示了深切的同情和支持。开罗四国首脑会议所体现的这种团结和相互支持的精神，充分地表现了阿拉伯各国人民维护独立和主权的坚定意志。因为阿拉伯各国人民在同殖民主义者的长期斗争中，深深地体验到只有继续加强阿拉伯各国之间的亲密的团结和合作，才能有力量抗拒外来的侵略，保卫自己的主权和独立。
    四国领导人重申他们决心要保障阿拉伯世界不受冷战的危害，坚持积极中立的政策，以维护阿拉伯国家的真正利益。他们主张阿拉伯各国的防务要由它们自己来安排，而不参加任何“外国公约”。四国领导人在联合公报里还指出，他们的国家切望在有助于和平、安全和繁荣的基础上在国际范围内发挥它们的作用，伸出它们的手来同一切国家合作；一切希望同阿拉伯国家友好的国家，必须尊重阿拉伯国家的主权和利益。阿拉伯国家坚持这种独立自主和和平中立立场，是符合阿拉伯各国人民的共同愿望的。
    但是，美国却对这个会议的结果表示不高兴。大家知道，美国为了夺取英法在中东地区的殖民地位，奴役中东人民，最近曾加紧了在中东的阴谋活动。美国千方百计地想分裂阿拉伯国家的团结，企图以美“援”诱使一些阿拉伯国家放弃它们的独立政策，把它们拉进西方军事侵略集团。美国曾毫不讳言地希望通过沙特阿拉伯国王说服其他阿拉伯国家同意“艾森豪威尔主义”。但是，阿拉伯四国会议的结果表明，美国的这个企图是失败了。华盛顿在阿拉伯四国会议联合公报发表后，立即对这个会议未能接受它的中东侵略计划表示“失望”，这暴露了美国统治集团的不安情绪。
    从阿拉伯四国会议的公报可以看出，美国向中东推销的所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”侵略计划，是完全违背阿拉伯国家的民族愿望的。美国口口声声说“艾森豪威尔主义”是为了“保护”中东各国免受侵略，但是实际上美国却在中东保护侵略者，并扩展自己的侵略势力。以色列拒绝执行联合国要它撤军的决议，理应受到联合国的严厉制裁，而美国却不顾亚非六国所提出的制裁以色列的建议，单独向以色列提出损害埃及主权利益的所谓“保证”，作为以色列从埃及撤军的条件。这表明美国实际上是完全站在侵略者一边。据外国资产阶级通讯社透露，美国同法国和以色列已经协议要由联合国部队无限期占领加沙地带和亚喀巴湾，并且由美国舰只进驻亚喀巴湾的海面以“保证”所谓“自由通航”。而就在这个时候，美国的两艘驱逐舰已经在红海出现了。显然，美国是企图继续利用以色列来威胁阿拉伯世界的和平和安全，对埃及和阿拉伯国家施加压力，以便美国在中东地区推行“艾森豪威尔主义”的侵略计划。
    阿拉伯四国会议对它们共同有关的各项问题达成协议，进一步加强阿拉伯国家内部的团结和合作，这是不利于对中东抱有侵略野心的殖民国家的。阿拉伯国家为了实现这些正义主张而作的一切努力，将会得到亚非国家和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的有力支持。
