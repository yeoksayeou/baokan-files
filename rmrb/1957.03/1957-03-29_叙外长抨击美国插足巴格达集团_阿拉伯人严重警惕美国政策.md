Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, March 27th: Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar told reporters that the United States' decision to participate in the Baghdad Pact's Military Committee means that the United States has transformed the Baghdad Pact into the material basis for its new plan for Middle Eastern countries.

Bitar said: "The Arabs see no difference between the new US doctrine and the Baghdad Pact. This fact forces the Arabs to treat the policies pursued by the United States and other Western countries with greater vigilance."

When talking about Syria's attitude toward the Baghdad Pact, Bitar said: "We have stated more than once that the Baghdad Pact is an imperialist treaty, and the participating countries, under the pretext of opposing communism, are attempting to suppress the resurgence of Arab nationalism."

　　叙外长抨击美国插足巴格达集团
　　阿拉伯人严重警惕美国政策
    新华社28日讯  据塔斯社大马士革27日讯：叙利亚外交部长比塔尔对新闻记者说，美国决定参加巴格达条约军事委员会意味着美国已经把巴格达条约变成它向中东国家提出的新计划的物质基础。
    比塔尔说：“阿拉伯人看不出美国的新主义同巴格达条约之间的区别。这个事实迫使阿拉伯人要以更高的警惕性来对待美国和其他西方国家所执行的政策。”
    比塔尔在谈到叙利亚对巴格达条约的态度的时候说：“我们已经不止一次地说明，巴格达条约是帝国主义条约，条约参加国在反对共产主义的借口下，企图压制阿拉伯民族主义的复兴。”
