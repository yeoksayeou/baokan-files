　　Yumen Station Does Not Cherish State Property
    The people of the motherland enthusiastically support the development of the Qaidam Basin and the Karamay Oilfield, transporting large quantities of means of production and daily necessities from all over the country. However, when the goods arrive at Yumen Railway Station, due to the poor sense of responsibility of the station staff and their lack of care for state property, many goods are severely damaged. For example, many prefabricated wooden houses transported from the Northeast were damaged during unloading because they were carelessly thrown from the train, rendering over 6,000 yuan worth of houses unusable. The scallions, white sugar, and flour unloaded here were buried in coal, and even toxic substances were placed together with food.
    We are grain workers supporting the Qaidam Basin and are particularly pained by this phenomenon of damaging state property. We have raised concerns with the relevant personnel at the station and the temporary management office in charge of the station, but their response was: "During the temporary management period, the owner is responsible for the entire shipment." As if their squandering of state property is justified.

### 玉门车站不爱惜国家物资

　　玉门车站不爱惜国家物资
    祖国人民热情地支援柴达木盆地、克拉玛依油田的开发工作，从各地运来大批生产资料和生活用品。但是，当货物运到玉门火车站的时候，由于站上工作人员责任心差，对国家的物资不够爱惜，许多货物遭到很大损坏。例如，从东北运来的活动木房，由于卸车时随便由车上往下抛，摔坏了很多木架，价值六千多元的木房已经成了残品。在这里卸下的大葱、白糖、面粉，被煤炭埋了起来甚至把毒品跟粮食放在一起。
    我们是支援柴达木盆地的粮食工作者，对这种损坏国家财产的现象感到特别痛心。我们曾经向车站有关人员和车站的上级临时管理处提过意见，他们的回答却是：“临时管理期间，整车货物由货主负责。”似乎他们糟蹋国家财产是应该的。　　　　　　　王恩强等五人
