　　Strive to Save More Than 10,000 Tons of Steel and More Than 50,000 Tons of Cement
　　The Metallurgical Department's Construction Bureau Actively Promotes New Technologies

　　(Reported by this newspaper) On the basis of 1956, the construction enterprises under the Metallurgical Industry Department's Construction Bureau have compiled outlines of technical organization measures to continue promoting new technologies and advanced experiences, saving a large amount of steel, wood, and cement.

　　According to incomplete statistics, in 1956, the construction enterprises under the Metallurgical Industry Department's Construction Bureau promoted a total of 479 new technologies and advanced experiences, of which 221 were in civil engineering, an increase of nearly three times compared with 1955. The promotion of these new technologies and advanced experiences played an important role in saving construction materials and accelerating the progress of projects. Due to the promotion of cold-processed steel bars, hot-rolled ribbed steel bars, contact welding, bamboo-reinforced concrete, fully welded blast furnaces, and padless installation, a total of more than 9,000 tons of steel were saved. Due to the promotion of bamboo scaffolding, bamboo formwork, revolving formwork, sliding formwork, and nail-less support with iron hooks, a total of 12,000 cubic meters of wood were saved. Due to the promotion of dry-hard concrete and admixtures, a total of more than 27,000 tons of cement were saved. The double short arc welding method, one-time welding method, and rapid welding method for metal structures can increase labor efficiency by 30% to 50%.

　　In order to continue promoting new technologies and advanced experiences on the existing basis, the Construction Bureau has recently compiled an outline of technical organization measures. This outline stipulates that this year, in addition to continuing to promote effective new technologies and advanced experiences, the focus will be on adopting and promoting six new technologies: prestressed reinforced concrete structures, prestressed reinforced concrete pipes, high-efficiency and cold-processed steel bars and welded steel bar skeletons and steel bar mesh, dry-hard concrete and low-flow concrete, admixtures and non-clinker cement and plasticizers, and bamboo and wood molds and bamboo-reinforced concrete. Strive to save more than 10,000 tons of steel, save more than 50,000 tons of cement, and save more than 50,000 cubic meters of wood.

　　At present, various construction enterprises are actively making preparations to take the promotion of the above-mentioned new technologies as an important way to achieve increased production and savings.

    争取节约钢材一万多吨水泥五万多吨
    冶金部建筑局积极推广新技术
    本报讯　冶金工业部建筑局所属各建筑企业在1956年的基础上，编出技术组织措施纲要，继续推广新技术和先进经验，节约大量钢材、木材和水泥。
    根据不完全的统计，1956年冶金工业部建筑局所属建筑企业推广的新技术和先进经验共有四百七十九项，其中土建方面就有二百二十一项，比1955年增加将近三倍。这些新技术和先进经验的推广，对节约建筑材料和加快工程进度起了重要的作用。由于推广了冷加工钢筋、热轧螺纹钢筋、接触焊接、竹筋混凝土、全焊高炉和无垫板安装等，共节约钢材九千多吨；由于推广了竹脚手、竹模板、翻转式模板、滑动模板和铁钩无钉支模等，共节约木材一万二千立方公尺；由于推广了干硬性混凝土、掺合料等，共节约水泥二万七千多吨。金属结构的双条短弧焊接法、一次焊成法和快速焊接法等可以使劳动效率提高30％到50％。
    为了在原有基础上继续推广新技术和先进经验。最近，建筑局已编制出技术组织措施纲要。这个纲要规定，今年除继续推广行之有效的新技术和先进经验外，将着重采用和推广预应力钢筋混凝土结构、预应力钢筋混凝土管、高效能和冷加工钢筋与焊接钢筋骨架和钢筋网、干硬性混凝土和低流动性混凝土、掺合料和无熟料水泥及塑化剂、竹木模和竹筋混凝土等六项新技术。争取节约钢材一万多吨，节约水泥五万吨以上，节约木材五万立方公尺以上。
    目前，各建筑企业正在积极进行准备，把推广以上各项新技术作为实现增产节约的重要途径。
