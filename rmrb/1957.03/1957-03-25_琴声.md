　　Piano Music

　　Ding Ye's nimble fingers danced on the steel keyboard; the resounding piano music was filled with friendship. He is not a musician giving a performance; he is an ordinary lathe operator from Moscow, operating as if at his beloved lathe, completing the day's work. I recall last winter, when the north wind tightly embraced the high-voltage lines, howling, and the factory suddenly became dim, all the machines in the factory stopped turning. It was you who climbed up the towering utility pole, braving the raging, cold north wind, using these same large hands that play the piano, to reconnect the broken industrial strings. Light returned to the workshop, and the rhythm of production proceeded like music. Today, you are again guiding us in using a new-style lathe, playing a happy movement…

　　琴声
　　丁耶那灵活的手指，在钢的键盘上跳动；铿锵的琴声，深怀着友情。不是音乐家在演奏，他是莫斯科一位普通的车工，好像在他心爱的车床上操作，把当日的活计完成。我想起去年冬天，北风紧抱着高压线嘶鸣，厂房忽然变得昏暗，全厂的机轮都停止转动。是你呀爬上几丈高的电杆，冒着狂暴、寒冷的北风，就用这双操琴的大手，将折断了的工业琴弦重新接通。光明又来到了车间，生产节奏音乐般地进行。今天，你又在指导我们使用一台新式车床，演奏那幸福的乐章……
