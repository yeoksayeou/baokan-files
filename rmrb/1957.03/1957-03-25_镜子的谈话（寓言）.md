　　The Mirror's Conversation (Fable)
　　Wu Yan
　　If I really were to record the mirror's conversation as a fable, then I would first have to criticize some fable writers: I don't know who it was, but someone wrote a fable about an ugly person scolding a mirror. Since then, the mirror in fables has either been scolded or beaten, and even shattering the mirror into pieces is considered a bit creative. The first person to write like this had some reason, but he was just thinking, I think, lacking a deep observation of life. To be honest, humans never argue with mirrors; we've always gotten along well!

　　We mirrors are more popular than photos. A colored photo that makes you look younger than you are might be hung on the wall in the bedroom; but a photo that's not ambiguous and accurately reflects reality is often criticized: "It looks so weird, the technology is terrible! It doesn't look like me at all!" Maybe in a fit of anger, they'll smash it on the ground.

　　Unless it's in a fable, who have you seen smash a mirror on the ground?

　　It should be emphasized that this is definitely not the result of us mirrors trying to please people. We have always been realistic and always truthfully reflect a person's entire appearance.

　　We reflect the whole picture. However, bald Mr. Zhao always concentrates on his silvery beard when he looks in the mirror; red-nosed old Zhang stares unblinkingly at his fancy tie; as for Miss Li, Miss Li's mouth is strangely large, and when she looks in the mirror, she looks at her mouth—the small mouth painted with lipstick on her big mouth.

　　That's how some people see themselves!

　　We see it all, but we don't speak; so we've always been harmonious and at peace with each other.

　　Speaking of which, I regret giving this talk. Too much talk leads to failure, and I'm afraid the fable I just criticized will become a prophecy from now on.

　　镜子的谈话（寓言）
　　吴岩
    如果真是要纪录镜子的谈话当作一篇寓言，那末我首先就要批评某些写作寓言的人：不知是哪一位，写了个丑八怪痛骂镜子的寓言，从此以后，寓言里的镜子不是挨骂就是挨打，至于镜子给摔得粉碎，就算写得有点儿创造性的了。第一位这样写的，总算有点儿道理；不过他也只是想当然吧了，我看还缺少对生活深刻的观察。——说句老实话，人类从来不跟镜子吵架，我们一向处得很好！
    我们镜子比像片还招人喜欢。一张着了色、显得比本人年轻的像片，固然会给挂在卧室里的墙上；可是一张一点不含糊、如实照来的像片，却时常招到非难：“照得多怪，技术真糟！——一点也不像我！”说不定一气之下就把它摔在地上了。
    除非在寓言里，谁看见谁把镜子摔在地上来着？
    应该着重说明的是：这决非我们镜子取悦人的结果。我们一向实事求是，总是如实地照出一个人的全貌来。
    我们照的是全貌。不过，秃头赵先生照镜时总是全神贯注在他那银色的胡须；红鼻子老张目不转睛地看着的，始终是他那条花领带；至于李小姐，李小姐的嘴巴大得古怪，她照镜时就看她的嘴巴——大嘴巴上用口红涂成的小嘴巴。
    有些人就是这样瞧他们自己的！
    我们都看在眼里，可是我们不说话；所以一向彼此和和气气，相安无事。
    说到这里，我倒懊悔发表这一番谈话了。多言必败，恐怕刚才被我批评过的寓言，从此要成为豫言了。
