Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 21st. The Hungarian "People's Freedom Daily" published an editorial on the 20th entitled "Truthful Words," clarifying the overall economic situation and tasks of Hungary at present.

The editorial stated that after the Hungarian armed counter-revolution was suppressed, the Hungarian national economy is gradually normalizing. Currently, the production of many factories has reached the level before the October incident last year, labor and financial discipline are increasingly consolidated, and workers' wages have been substantially increased. Workers' wages in February this year increased by about 20% compared to the same period last year. After the abolition of compulsory sales, farmers' incomes have greatly increased. Commodity prices are stable, and there is no lack of supply of daily necessities for residents. The number of unemployed is not as high as expected.

The editorial then discussed the current difficulties and problems. It said that domestic consumption is exceeding production day by day. The counter-revolutionary rebellion reduced Hungary's national income by about 10%, but people are living better than ever before. At present, production has been reduced, productivity has decreased by 15%, and production costs have increased, but the market prices of goods have not changed.

The editorial emphasized that this "luxury" phenomenon of only caring about today and not caring about tomorrow should not continue. We are living on national reserves and foreign debt. Foreign debts must be repaid; no country has ever been able to live on foreign debt.

The editorial continued: Another reason for the current situation is the sharp decline in investment. In 1957, 95% of national economic income will be used for consumption, and only 5% will be accumulated; while in 1954-1955, investment reached 18%-20% of national income. The current situation cannot last, otherwise, expanded reproduction will be abandoned, and the continued improvement of people's living standards will be abandoned. The Party and the government must take measures to avoid inflation.

The editorial pointed out when discussing the current tasks that, first of all, the central ministries should strengthen guidance for production. While improving leadership methods, establishing good relations with enterprises, and not harming the independence of enterprises, it is necessary to strengthen guidance for enterprise production, so that factories across the country can quickly restore order and production can reach the level before the October incident last year.

Hungary lacks raw materials, and foreign trade is very important. Imports in January and February this year increased by 42% compared to the same period last year, while exports were only equivalent to 14% of the same period last year. Export tasks must be completed as soon as possible, otherwise, due to delayed delivery, markets won for many years will be lost.

　　匈牙利经济逐渐正常化
　　许多工厂生产达到事件前水平
    目前困难是消费量超过生产量
    新华社布达佩斯21日电　匈牙利“人民自由报”20日以“真实的话”为题发表社论，阐明匈牙利当前的整个经济情况和任务。
    社论说，在匈武装反革命被镇压以后，匈牙利国民经济，正在逐渐正常化。现在，许多工厂的生产已经达到去年10月事件以前的水平，劳动和财政纪律日益巩固，工人工资已经大量提高。今年2月份工人的工资约比去年同时期提高了20％。义务交售制取消后，农民收入大增。商品价格稳定，对居民日常用品的供应也不感缺乏。失业人数不如预料的那么多。
    社论接着谈到了当前存在的困难和问题。它说，国内消费量正在逐日超过生产量。反革命暴乱使匈牙利的国民收入约减少了10％，而目前人们却比以前任何时候都生活得好。目前，生产减缩了，生产率降低了15％，生产成本提高了，但市场上的商品价格却没有变动。
    社论着重指出：这种只顾今天，不顾明天的“豪华”现象不应继续存在。我们是在依靠国家储备和借外债过活。外债必需偿还，从来没有一个国家能够靠外债过活。
    社论接着说：造成当前这种情况的另一原因是：投资的锐减。1957年，国民经济收入的95％将用于消费，积累部分只有5％；而1954—1955年投资达国民收入的18％—20％。目前这种情况是不能持久的，否则就要放弃扩大再生产，放弃人民生活水平的继续提高。党和政府必须采取措施避免通货膨胀。
    社论在谈到当前的任务时指出，首先是中央各部加强指导生产。在改善领导方法、同企业建立良好关系和不损害企业的独立性的同时，要加强对企业生产的指导，使全国工厂迅速恢复秩序，使生产达到去年10月事件前的水平。
    匈牙利缺乏原料，对外贸易十分重要。今年一、二两月的进口比去年同时期增加了42％，而出口只相当于去年同期的14％。必需从速完成出口任务，否则由于交货迟缓，就会丧失多年赢得的市场。
