Regarding Several Questions Regarding Private Folk Opera Troupes
    Speech by Li Zaiwen

    I am a Pingju actress. In the past few years, the Party and the government have shown great concern for the development of opera and the lives of actors. For example, in 1956, seven cultural and entertainment taxes were waived, and at the same time, 5 million yuan was allocated nationwide for arrangements and relief. We are extremely grateful for these measures. Now, I would like to share some opinions based on my experience.

    Some artists have a tendency to reject new literary and art workers. I hope this issue will be addressed for the sake of the future development of opera.

    1. Since liberation, thanks to the care of the Party and the government, a large number of new literary and art workers have joined the opera troupes to help us work. This has allowed opera art to shine as never before. I personally received letters from some audience members saying that they did not like Pingju in the past because the artistic level of Pingju was not high. But now, after watching a Pingju performance by chance, they were very surprised by the rapid progress of Pingju art and fell in love with Pingju. These gains make us affirm that they are the result of the close cooperation between many new literary and art workers and opera artists. Of course, there are also individual new literary and art workers who do not adequately understand relying on artists and have made crude mistakes in opera reform, but that is, after all, a minority.

    After the repertoire meeting, some outdated rules and regulations were abolished, and the repertoire was enriched. This is undoubtedly a good thing, but what followed was a rhetoric that excluded new literary and art workers from participating in opera reform, arguing that opera reform should be done only by opera artists, without the participation of new literary and art workers. This rhetoric fueled the sentiments of some artists to reject new literary and art workers, making them uneasy in their work positions. I personally believe that this approach is not beneficial to the future development of opera and will be detrimental to both sides. On the one hand, it alienates new literary and art workers from national traditions; on the other hand, it prevents opera artists from absorbing fresh nourishment. Relevant departments and the media should pay attention to this issue.

    There is a bias in state subsidy funds, favoring the large over the small and the public over the private. I also request the government to consider allocating more funds.

    2. In recent years, national theaters (troupes) have played a significant role in improving artistic quality and meeting the cultural and entertainment needs of the broad masses of the people. This is undoubtedly due to the large amount of human and material resources invested by the state. However, the number of national theaters (troupes) is small, and in terms of the number and scope of audience contact, they are far inferior to private folk opera troupes. However, the subsidy funds for private folk opera troupes are very small for some, and non-existent for others. Taking Beijing as an example, last year, the Ministry of Culture only provided 18,000 yuan in subsidies to the city's 42 private folk opera troupes. Compared to the 3 million yuan in expenses used by the nine directly affiliated troupes of the central government throughout the year, this is a world of difference. The Ministry of Culture has criticized the past bias towards the large over the small and the public over the private in theater work, but in practice, there is little change to be seen. Of course, I am not saying that national theaters should not receive subsidies. For example, new opera, Kunqu opera, etc., still need strong support from the state, but opera (troupes) such as spoken drama, opera, acrobatics, etc., should be urged to economize and gradually move towards enterprise management.

    I heard that the subsidy funds for private folk opera troupes have increased this year, but because there are too many troupes, it still does not solve much of the problem. Private folk opera troupes are in financial difficulties and are busy rehearsing and performing all day long (performing two shows a day, and three shows on holidays). It is difficult to improve quickly in terms of politics and art and to meet the growing needs of the broad masses of the people in cultural entertainment. Therefore, it is necessary to ask the government to consider increasing the funds allocated to the cultural departments of various provinces and cities for subsidizing private folk opera troupes.

    Private troupes sometimes have to "pass through five checkpoints" when touring in the countryside. I hope they will receive the support and care they deserve.

    3. It is a good thing for private folk opera troupes to tour the countryside and perform to connect with the masses more widely. However, in some areas, because the troupe is not provided with enough complimentary tickets, it often encounters situations such as suspension of performances, power outages, and late-night household registration checks. I hope that the cultural authorities will establish a clear theater enterprise system and strengthen support and care for troupes touring in the countryside in order to guarantee the troupe's income.

    Pingju urgently needs to be enriched in terms of performance and music. I hope that the cultural departments will provide more support and assistance.

    4. The characteristics of Pingju are that it can reflect modern life, is easy to understand, and is popular with the broad masses of the people. It is the local opera with the widest audience area in the country. At present, there are Pingju troupes all over the country, as far as Guizhou and Xinjiang. However, because Pingju is a relatively young art form, there are not many repertoires, and it urgently needs to be enriched in terms of performance and music. I hope that the cultural authorities in various places will pay special attention to the support and assistance of Pingju.

    The audience likes serial plays, but we must help to sort out the scripts, eliminate the dross, and preserve the essence.

    5. Recently, serial plays have been staged in large numbers in various places. Most of these plays do not have scripts, no accurate lyrics, and have not been rehearsed. The actors improvise their lines on stage, so the artistic quality is low, and there are inevitably many erotic, superstitious, and absurd elements. The emergence of serial plays is inseparable from the actual situation of the troupes and the preferences of the audience. The troupes do not have new scripts, and even if they do, they are too busy performing two or three shows a day and have no time to rehearse. Therefore, the easiest way is to perform serial plays with improvised lines. The audience likes to watch plays with coherent plots and tortuous stories, and serial plays have this characteristic, so even if the artistic quality is very low, the audience still likes to watch them. Since the emergence of serial plays has its social reasons, it should not be simply negated. We should help the troupes to sort out the scripts, process and rehearse them, eliminate the dross, and preserve the essence. I hope that the cultural authorities in various places will pay attention to this issue.

    I do not have a comprehensive understanding of the above issues, and my views on the issues may also be incorrect. Please correct me, comrades. (Attached image)

　　关于民间职业剧团的几个问题
　　李再雯的发言
    我是评剧演员，过去几年来，党和政府对于戏曲事业的发展和演员的生活，都非常关怀，例如：1956年免征七项文化娱乐税，同时全国内拨款五百万元，进行安排救济，这些都使我们感激不尽，现在仅就我接触到的问题谈几点意见。
    部分艺人有排斥新文艺工作者的情绪，为了戏曲事业的发展前途，希望重视这个问题。
    一、自从解放以来，由于党和政府对我们的关怀，派了大批新文艺工作者参加了戏曲队伍，帮助我们工作，使戏曲艺术放出前所未有的光彩，我个人曾接到一些观众来信，谈到因为过去的评剧艺术水平不高，所以不喜欢看评剧；而现在偶然看了一次评剧以后，对评剧艺术的突飞猛进感到非常惊异，因而爱上了评剧。这些收获使我们不能不肯定是因为有许多新文艺工作者勤勤恳恳地与戏曲艺人亲密合作得来的。当然也有个别新文艺工作者对依靠艺人认识不足，在戏曲改革工作中犯了粗暴的错误，但那究竟是少数的。
    剧目会议以后，废除了一些清规戒律，繁荣了上演剧目，无疑，这是好事情，但随之而来的，是产生了一种排斥新文艺工作者参加戏曲改革工作的论调：认为戏曲改革只要由戏曲艺人搞就行了，不必有新文艺工作者参预。这种论调助长部分艺人排斥新文艺工作者的情绪，使新文艺工作者不安于工作岗位。我个人认为这样对待戏曲事业的发展前途没有好处，反而会两败俱伤。一方面，使新文艺工作者离开了民族传统；一方面，使戏曲艺人吸收不到新鲜的营养。有关部门和舆论界应当重视这个问题。
    国家补助经费有重大轻小、重公轻私的偏差，并请政府考虑多拨一些。
    二、几年来，国家剧院（团）在提高艺术质量、满足广大人民文化娱乐要求方面，起到很大作用，无疑是由于国家投入了大量人力物力才得到的成绩。但国家剧院（团）数量少，在联系观众的数字和范围上讲，却远远不及民间职业剧团，而民间职业剧团的补助经费，有的补助很少，有的根本没有。就以北京市来说，去年全市四十二个民间职业剧团，文化部只给了一万八千元的补助费。这与中央直属的九个剧院（团）全年要用三百万的经费数字比较起来，真有天渊之别。文化部曾批判过去在剧团工作中有重大轻小、重公轻私的偏差，但在实际行动中，还看不出有多大改变。当然我不是说国家剧院不应该有补助，例如新歌剧、昆曲等，还需要国家大力扶持，但话剧、戏曲、杂技等院（团）应该促使其节约开支，逐步走上企业化。
    听说今年对民间职业剧团的补助经费有所增加，但因为剧团太多，仍然解决不了多大问题。民间职业剧团在经费上既感困难，只有整天忙于排戏、演出（一天演两场，假日要演三场），不论在政治、艺术上都不能很快提高，很难满足广大人民在文化娱乐方面不断增长的需要，因此，有必要提请政府考虑，增加拨给各省市文化主管部门用于补助民间职业剧团的经费。
    民间剧团下乡巡回，有时要“过五关”，希望得到应有的支持和关怀。
    三、民间职业剧团下乡巡回演出能更广泛的联系群众，是件好事；而有的地区为了剧团送招待券送的不够周到，往往发生停演、停电、深夜查户口等过五关的情形。希望文化主管部门定出明确的剧团企业制度，加强对下乡剧团的支持与关怀，才能保证剧团收入。
    评剧在表演和音乐方面急待丰富，希望文化部门多加扶持和帮助。
    四、评剧的特点是能够反映现代生活，通俗易懂，为广大群众所喜闻乐见，在全国是观众面积最广的地方戏，目前全国各地，远至贵州、新疆，都有评剧团。但由于评剧的成长年代不久，因此剧目不多，在表演和音乐方面还急待丰富，希望各地文化主管部门特别重视对评剧的扶持和帮助。
    观众爱好连台本戏，但必须帮助整理剧本，剔除糟粕，保存精华。
    五、最近各地又在大量上演连台本戏，这些戏大半没有剧本，没有准词，没有经过排练，演员到台上临时编词，因此艺术质量低，且不免有许多色情、迷信、荒诞成分。连台本戏之所以出现，是与剧团的实际情况和观众的爱好分不开的，剧团没有新剧本，即使有新剧本，也由于一天演两三场戏而疲于奔命，没有时间排练，因此最省事的办法就是演跑梁子的连台本戏。观众喜欢看情节连贯、故事曲折的戏，连台本戏就有这一特点，因此即使艺术质量很低，观众也爱看。既然连台本戏的产生有其社会原因，就不能一概否定，应该帮助各剧团整理剧本，加工排演，剔除糟粕，保存精华。希望各地文化主管部门注意这一问题。
    以上几个问题，我本人了解的不够全面，在问题的看法上也可能不正确，请同志们指正。（附图片）
