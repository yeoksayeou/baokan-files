    Rambling Talk on Ghana
    Yang Xianyi
    Recently, a new country has appeared in West Africa. The "Gold Coast," which had been under the colonial rule of Portugal, the Netherlands, and Great Britain since the fifteenth century, celebrated its independence on March 6th and officially changed its name to "Ghana," the original name of this ancient independent kingdom.
    Ancient Westerners, such as the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, and Greeks, only reached the northern and eastern coasts of Africa. Arabs in the Middle Ages also did not establish a foothold in this Black country. Although the Chinese of the Tang and Song dynasties also reached many African countries, it seems they were also only on the eastern and northern coasts. Knowledge of West Africa was almost zero, so there are very few ancient records about the Gold Coast.
    Through the Arabs (called "Dashiren" at that time), the Chinese of the Tang and Song dynasties only knew that the farthest country westward along the northern coast of Africa was Mulanpi (a transliteration from the Song Dynasty; in the Tang Dynasty, it was called Molin), which was a simplified transliteration of the Arabic "Maghrib el Aksa," meaning "the westernmost country," referring to present-day Morocco and the area to its west. Zhou Qufei's "Lingwai Daida" of the Southern Song Dynasty states: "The land of Dashi is very vast, with many countries, too many to list in full. Further west, there is a sea called the Western Dashi Sea. Beyond it to the west are the countries of Mulanpi, totaling over a thousand; even further west is where the sun sets, beyond our knowledge." From this, it can be seen that the "westernmost area" of Mulanpi referred to many countries, not just Morocco. Therefore, it seems acceptable to say that the country of Ghana was included within this general name of "Mulanpi."
    The ancient Kingdom of Ghana was established as early as the fourth century AD. It was one of the earliest countries in West Africa, with its capital moved several times. In 1076, the kingdom was invaded by Arabs from the Moroccan region. In 1203, the kingdom was restored. In 1240, the capital was destroyed again, and the capital was moved to Molli, after which it was renamed the Kingdom of Molli, lasting until 1670. For many centuries, this kingdom was the most powerful country in West Africa. A famous Arab traveler of the fourteenth century, Ibn Battuta, was from the Moroccan region. He traveled extensively in Eastern countries, reaching China, and also reached the vicinity of the Gold Coast in West Africa. He left behind a very interesting travelogue, from which I translate a section describing the life of the people of the ancient city of Molli:
    "These black people have some very good qualities. They are very just, and more determined than other tribes to oppose injustice. Their king shows no leniency towards any unfair behavior. National order is very stable. Residents and travelers do not have to fear thieves and robbers. If a foreigner dies in their country, even if the property is not precisely known, they do not confiscate it. They always hand over the deceased's property to a trustworthy person of the same nationality to manage until a legal heir is found. They observe prayer times, participate in collective worship, and also ask their children to do so. Every Friday, if people are late for the mosque, they will not find a seat… Another good habit is that they always change into clean white clothes on Fridays. Even if he only has a tattered garment, he washes it clean before going to worship. They are also enthusiastic about reciting the Quran. If children do not memorize the Quran well, they lock them up until they can recite it, and then release them."
    In the Middle Ages, the Arabs of West Africa had very large seagoing ships, which were called "Mulan Boats" in Chinese records of the Song Dynasty. Zhou Qufei's "Lingwai Daida" has a good description, saying: "One boat can hold several thousand people, and the boat has wine, food shops, weaving looms, and the like; it is said that the largest boats are the Mulan Boats." "Floating southward on the South China Sea, the boat is like a giant room, the sail like a cloud covering the sky, and the rudder is dozens of feet long. One boat has hundreds of people, with enough grain for a year, raising pigs and brewing wine on board, placing life and death outside consideration. Entering directly into the obstructed and blue depths, it is no longer the human world; the people on board strike livestock, drink happily, and take turns being hosts and guests, to forget their peril; the boatswain discerns the various foreign countries in the sky based on the mountains vaguely visible at sea; if they say they are going to a certain country, they look forward to a certain mountain in a few days with a favorable wind, and the boat should turn to a certain direction. If they encounter a sudden storm, even if it is not yet the day, and they already see a certain mountain, they should also change direction; if the boat travels too far, with no direction to return, and drifts to a shallow place and encounters a hidden rock, then it will fall apart. Because their boats are large and heavily loaded, they do not worry about huge waves, but worry about shallow water." This account of West African navigation is very vivid, and clearly spoken by someone who has had this kind of experience; perhaps some Chinese during the Southern Song Dynasty also traveled to West Africa on Arab merchant ships. We know that Song Dynasty Chinese coins have been found in many places on the east coast of Africa, indicating that Chinese merchants once traded in that area; perhaps in the future, traces of ancient Chinese navigators will also be found in Ghana; this is not entirely impossible.
    Since the fifteenth century, colonizers from Western countries such as Portugal have successively arrived here. Initially, they only occupied a small coastal town, which the Portuguese called "Elmina," meaning "gold mine," and later gradually encroached inward. The British colonizers waged many years of war here, encountering heroic resistance from the people of Ghana; especially the Ashanti people's resistance was very fierce. The colonizers used massacre, bribery, and divide-and-conquer policies to barely conquer the country; but the heroic people of Ghana finally drove the colonizers out. Looking back at the glorious history of our Asian and African people, I wish the people of Ghana to build their country even stronger and better than in the past.

    漫谈加纳
    杨宪益
    最近西部非洲出现了一个新的国家。从十五世纪以来就先后处于葡萄牙、荷兰和英国殖民统治之下的“黄金海岸”，于3月6日庆祝独立，并正式改称“加纳”，这是这个古代独立王国的原名。
    古代西方的腓尼基人，迦太基人，希腊人等都只到过非洲北岸和东岸，中古时代的阿拉伯人也没有在这个黑人国家站住脚，唐宋时代的中国人虽然也到过非洲许多国家，但好像也都在东岸和北岸，关于西部非洲所知几等于零，所以关于黄金海岸的古代记载是很少的。
    通过当时的大食人，就是说阿拉伯人，唐宋时代的中国人只知道沿着非洲北岸向西去，最远的国家是木兰皮国（这是宋代人的译音，唐代称之为摩邻国），这是阿拉伯文Maghrib el Aksa的简译，意思是“极西的国家”，也就是指当时的摩洛哥及以西地方。南宋周去非的“岭外代答”里说：“大食之地甚广，其国甚多，不可悉载。又其西有海，名西大食海，渡之而西，则木兰皮诸国，凡千余；更西则日之所入，不得而闻也”。由此可见，“木兰皮”这极西地带是指许多国家而言，并不只限于摩洛哥一国；那样我们如果说加纳这一国家也包括在“木兰皮”这一总名之内，似乎也没有什么不可以。
    古代的加纳（Ghana）王国是在纪元四世纪就已经建立了，它是西非最早的一个国家，国都曾迁移过多次；在1076年这王国为摩洛哥地方的大食人所侵入；在1203年王国又恢复了；在1240年国都又被毁，都城迁到摩利（Malli），此后改称为摩利国，一直到1670年。在许多世纪里，这个王国曾是西部非洲最强盛的一个国家。十四世纪有一位著名的阿拉伯旅行家伊宾拔图塔，是摩洛哥地方人；他曾遍游东方各国，到过中国，也到过西部非洲黄金海岸附近；他留下一部极有趣味的游记，这里我把他描写古代摩利城的人民生活的一段转译下来：
    “这些黑种人有着一些很好的品质。他们很公正，比别族人更坚决反对不公平的事。他们的国王对于任何不公平的行为毫不宽宥。国家秩序非常安定。居民和旅客都不必害怕盗贼强人。如果有外国人死在他们国内，即使财产没有确数，他们也不加以没收，他们总是将死者的财产交给可靠的同一国人代管，直到找到合法的继承者。他们遵守祈祷时间，集体参加礼拜，也叫他们子弟们这样作。每星期五，如果人去礼拜堂晚了，就会找不到位置……另一良好习惯就是他们在星期五总换干净白色衣服。即使他只有一领破衣，他也把它洗得干干净净，才去礼拜。他们也热心背诵可兰经。如果小孩子背不熟可兰经，他们就把小孩子锁起来，直到他能背诵，方才释放”。
    在中古时期，非洲西部的大食人有很巨大的海船，在宋代中国纪载里这些大船被称为“木兰舟”。周去非的“岭外代答”里有一段很好的描写，说：“一舟容数千人，舟中有酒食肆机杼之属；言舟之大者，莫木兰若也。”“浮南海而南，舟如巨室，帆若垂天之云，柂长数丈。一舟数百人，中积一年粮，豢豕酿酒其中，置死生于度外。径入阻碧，非复人世；人在其中，日击牲酣饮，迭为宾主，以忘其危；舟师以海上隐隐有山，辨诸蕃国皆在空端；若曰往某国，顺风几日望某山，舟当转行某方。或遇急风，虽未足日，已见某山，亦当改方；苟舟行太过，无方可返，飘至浅处而遇暗石，则当瓦解矣。盖其舟大载重，不忧巨浪，而忧浅水也。”这段关于西部非洲航海的纪载描写很生动，显然是有过这种经验的人才说得出；也许南宋时也有中国人乘着大食商船到过非洲西部。我们知道，在非洲东岸许多地方都曾经发现过宋代的中国钱币，说明中国商人曾在那一带进行过交易；也许将来在加纳也会发现古代中国航海家的遗迹；这并不是完全不可能的事。
    十五世纪以来葡萄牙等西方国家的殖民者陆续到达这里，最初他们只占据了一个海边小镇；葡萄牙人称之为“埃尔明纳”（El mina），就是“金矿”的意思，后来逐渐蚕食到内部。英国殖民者曾在此进行了许多年的战争，遭到了加纳人民的英勇抵抗；尤其是亚山蒂族（Ashanti）抗战非常激烈；殖民者用了屠杀、收买和分化政策，才勉强把这个国家征服；但英雄的加纳人民终于把殖民者赶出去了。回顾我们亚非人民过去的光荣历史，我预祝加纳人民把他们国家建设得比过去更加强盛，更加美好。
