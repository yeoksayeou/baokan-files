Xinhua News Agency, March 11th: TASS, New York, March 10th: The current issue of the American magazine "Monthly Review" sharply criticizes the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

The magazine points out: "The Eisenhower Doctrine arose from the dead end situation in the Near East and North Africa following the failed Anglo-French invasion of Egypt. The motive for creating this doctrine was to turn the entire region into an American sphere of influence, a typical imperialist move." It aims to seize this vast region rich in extremely valuable strategic raw material resources. It is "a declaration demanding the establishment of a vast Afro-Asian empire."

The magazine continues to point out that the imperialist policy manifested in the "Eisenhower Doctrine" cannot be implemented without the use of military force. This policy is "poison for underdeveloped countries," it insults the national dignity of these countries and violates their national interests.

"Monthly Review" concludes by saying that the foundation of the Eisenhower Doctrine is "the old foreign policy that has repeatedly failed for ten years, and has been disastrously defeated more than once. It is failing now, and it will fail in the future."

Xinhua News Agency, March 11th: U.S. Vice President Nixon arrived in Uganda on the 10th.

At a banquet in Liberia, Nixon admitted that the purpose of his visit to African countries was to "awaken" Americans to pay more "attention" to the continent's resources and people.

    美国“每月评论”指出
    艾森豪威尔主义是对不发达国家的毒药
    尼克松自供要鼓励美国加紧侵略非洲
    据新华社11日讯　据塔斯社纽约10日讯：这一期的美国“每月评论”杂志尖锐地批评了“艾森豪威尔主义”。
    杂志指出：“艾森豪威尔主义是由于英、法侵埃失败而在近东和北非穷途末日的情况中产生的，产生这种主义的动机是打算把这整个地区变为典型帝国主义的美国势力范围”。是要夺取这个富有极宝贵的战略原料资源的广大地区。是“要求建立巨大的亚非帝国的宣言”。
    杂志接着指出，表现为“艾森豪威尔主义”的帝国主义政策不使用军事力量是无法实行的，这种政策是“对不发达国家的毒药”，它侮辱这些国家的民族尊严，违背它们的民族利益。
    “每月评论”最后说，艾森豪威尔主义的基础就是“十年来屡次失利、而且不止一次地遭到惨败的旧的对外政策。它现在失败，将来也是会失败的”。
    据新华社11日讯　美国副总统尼克松10日到达乌干达。
    在利比里亚的一次宴会上，尼克松承认，他访问非洲国家的目的，是要“唤醒”美国人更多地“注意”这个大陆的资源和人民。
