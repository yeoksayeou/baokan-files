　　Speaking Up for Pregnant Women
　　Zhang Zhong
    On Sunday, I went to visit a comrade I know well and heard the following story:

    This comrade's wife is a female cadre in an organization and is currently pregnant. For the safety of the fetus and the delivery, she went to the hospital a few days ago to check the fetal position. It should be encouraged to go to check the fetal position before delivery. However, she was discriminated against by some medical staff. She went in the morning; there were other pregnant women waiting for examination. The medical staff were very impatient with these pregnant women. As soon as they came in, they frowned and said in a contemptuous tone, "Oh! So many people!" Then, they started the examination. This female comrade waited from nine o'clock to eleven o'clock, but she was only felt for the fetal position, and the examination was completed in about a minute. This female comrade is pregnant for the second time. According to her, the fetal position check used to be very careful, listening to the fetal heartbeat, testing urine, and asking many questions. During the initial examination, blood tests and fluoroscopy were also performed, and the medical staff showed the greatest care and patience. At that time, every time the fetal position was checked, there was a sense of maternal glory and pride, and she was full of trust and gratitude to the medical staff. Of course, people do not demand that women who are pregnant for the second time be examined as carefully as women who are pregnant for the first time; nor do they demand that women with normal fetal positions spend too much time. However, this perfunctory approach cannot be said to be appropriate. She said that what made people particularly embarrassed was that she felt a kind of pressure as soon as she entered the hospital gate, as if being pregnant was a mistake, she felt uneasy and wronged.

    This female comrade was obviously dissatisfied with the discrimination she received. She should be dissatisfied and should condemn this behavior of discriminating against pregnant women in her capacity as a mother.

    Why is this happening? In addition to the irresponsibility of these medical staff, I think there is a deviation in the understanding of birth control. Appropriately controlling births to avoid having too many children too closely spaced, which would prevent proper upbringing and education, harm the mother's health, hinder the parents' work and study, and place too heavy an economic burden on the family, is a pressing demand of the masses at present. This demand is reasonable, and the government has taken some measures to meet the demands of the masses, and some newspapers and periodicals are doing publicity and explanation in many ways. However, at this time, some people have misconceptions about the issue of birth control. They seem to think that since public opinion is advocating it, the masses are taking action, and the government is supporting it, everyone should of course practice contraception. If anyone does not practice contraception and becomes pregnant, it is a disgraceful act and should be looked down upon.

    This view is of course wrong. First of all, although contraception is the demand of the masses, it does not equal the demand of everyone; promoting contraception does not mean that pregnancy is not allowed. Secondly, contraception should be completely voluntary and should not be forced, nor is it allowed to be forced. Thirdly, if someone becomes pregnant, the mother and fetus should not be discriminated against. In our country, at any time, people are the most valuable, and mothers and children are protected.

    Let us treat the issue of birth control with a correct attitude, and not be extreme! Let us treat pregnant women who come for fetal position checks with a correct attitude, as this is also the sacred responsibility of medical staff at any time.

### 为孕妇不平

　　为孕妇不平
　　张重
    星期天，我到一个熟识的同志家里去坐，听来这样一件事情——
    这个同志的爱人，是个机关女干部，现在怀着孕。为了胎儿和产期的安全，头几天，她到医院去检查胎位。产前去检查胎位，这原是应当鼓励的。可是，她却受到某些医务人员的歧视。她是早晨去的；一起等候检查的还有一些孕妇。医务人员对这些孕妇一肚子不耐烦，一进来，就皱起眉头，用鄙夷的口气说：“嗬！这么多人！”随后，开始检查。这个女同志从九点等到十一点，可是，只被摸了摸胎位，大约一分钟就检查完了。这个女同志是第二次怀孕，据她说，过去检查胎位，做得很仔细，要听胎儿心声，要验小便，还要问很多情况。最初检查的时候，还要验血、透视，医务人员表现了最大的关怀和耐心。那时，每逢检查胎位，都有着一种母亲的光荣感和骄傲，对医务人员也充满着信任和感谢。当然，人们并不要求对第二次怀孕的妇女，也像对第一次怀孕的妇女那样，检查得那么仔细；也不要求对胎位正常的妇女，花费过多的时间。但是草草了事的这种作法，却无论如何不能说是妥当的。她说，特别使人难堪的，从一进医院大门就感到一种压力，好像怀了孕就是犯了甚么过失，内心不安，又觉得委屈。
    这个女同志显然对受到的歧视不满。她应当不满，应当以母亲的身份责备这种歧视孕妇的行为。
    为甚么会出现这种情况呢？除了这些医务人员不够负责以外，我认为是对节制生育的理解有偏差。适当地节制生育，免得孩子过多过密，不能好好抚养、教育，免得损害母亲的健康，妨害父母的工作和学习，使家庭的经济负担过重，这是当前群众的一项迫切要求。这种要求是合理的，政府已经采取了一些措施用来满足群众的要求，一些报纸刊物也正从多方面来做宣传解释。但是，在这时候，有人却对节制生育问题产生了错觉。他们似乎认为，既然舆论在提倡，群众在行动，政府赞助，每一个人当然应当避孕，如果谁不避孕，哪一个怀了孕，就是不光采的行为，就应当瞧不起她。
    这种看法当然是错的。首先，避孕虽是群众的要求，但不等于每一个人的要求；不是提倡避孕就不许怀孕。其次，避孕，要完全自愿，不应该强制，也不允许强制。第三，如果怀孕了，就不能歧视母亲和胎儿。在我们国家，在任何时候，人都是最宝贵的，母亲和儿童都是受到保护的。
    用正确的态度来对待节制生育问题吧，不要偏激！用正确的态度对待检查胎位的孕妇吧，在任何时候这也是医务工作人员的神圣责任。
