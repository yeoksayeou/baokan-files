I completely agree with the reports made by Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Chen. Before the opening of this conference, I heard Chairman Mao's important instructions on the correct handling of contradictions among the people at the enlarged Supreme State Conference, which enabled me to clearly distinguish between the contradictions between the enemy and ourselves and the contradictions among the people. My ideological understanding has been further improved, and I feel very excited.

Now, I would like to put forward some immature views and superficial opinions on the issue of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Chinese herbal medicine. I hope that you will correct me if they are inappropriate.

　　First, the Problems Within TCM

Since I started practicing medicine, I have seen from decades of experience that the situation is, undeniably, complex. Before liberation, it was not easy to unify TCM academics. You had your own set of ideas, and I had mine. Thus, the so-called "Medical Classic School," "Classical Formula School," "Contemporary Formula School," and "Integration of Chinese and Western Medicine School" emerged. Although the "Four Schools" each had their own advantages, they ultimately had more opportunities for infighting and attacks. Under one-sided development, they also exposed many weaknesses.

For example, the "Medical Classic School" likes to say that certain aspects definitely contain Taoist thought. The "Inner Canon" *Suwen* can generally be determined to be a work from the Warring States period to the Western Han Dynasty. Taoism only began with Zhang Daoling in the Eastern Han Dynasty. I don't know how a work before the Western Han Dynasty could be influenced by Eastern Han Taoism. I really can't figure it out. No wonder others call it "metaphysics" as an object of attack.

The "Classical Formula School" divides the *Treatise on Cold Damage* into six meridians, emphasizing that it has nothing to do with the *Inner Canon*, only inheriting its name. It cannot be explained using heat theory. Although I don't fully understand the spirit of the *Treatise on Cold Damage*, I flipped through the original text and saw "needle the Foot Yangming," "puncture Qimen," etc. in the six meridian chapters. I think acupuncture is also a method of "treating according to the symptoms." I don't know if Foot Yangming and Qimen are related to the meridians. If they are related, then it is not just inheriting the name. The "Contemporary Formula School's" *Treatise on Febrile Diseases* is full of *Guizhi Tang* (Cinnamon Twig Decoction), *Baihu Jia Renshen Tang* (White Tiger Decoction with Ginseng), *Zhizi Chi Tang* (Gardenia and Prepared Soybean Decoction), *Da Chengqi Tang* (Major Qi-Regulating Decoction), and other classical formulas. Are *Guizhi Tang* in *Treatise on Febrile Diseases* and *Guizhi Tang* in *Treatise on Cold Damage* different? If they are not different, then the saying that ancient formulas cannot treat modern diseases will be refuted without being attacked.

The "Integration of Chinese and Western Medicine School" says that the Sanjiao (Triple Burner) is the omentum or lymphatic glands, which may be acceptable. However, everything is based on Western medicine, and only Chinese medicine is used for treatment. Therefore, the meaning of integration is like finding a needle in a haystack.

Being able to form a "school" is certainly a good thing, like the debates of the Four Great Masters of the Jin and Yuan Dynasties, each with their own inventions and creations. We should not stubbornly cling to one aspect and form separatism. Mutual attacks are of no help and turn good things into bad things. After liberation, Wang Bin's thought was criticized, and the iron tree of TCM blossomed, rising again. Many of the past advantages of TCM have been gradually discovered, but the "Four Schools" created by historical conditions inevitably have some overlap. Therefore, there are not only theoretical disputes within TCM, but also more differences in clinical practice. In the past, TCM was a plate of loose sand and was about to be eliminated. Naturally, no one felt that what you said was right or what I said was right, which one was right or wrong. Now, under the same goal, the phenomenon of each doing their own thing and not being able to agree has emerged, causing many problems and affecting the unity within TCM. Although we also know that holding our own opinions and excluding each other is wrong, this error at most remains at the stage of understanding and has not been moved forward. This greatly disappoints the Party's concern for TCM. As a TCM practitioner, I feel very out of place. Therefore, I request that the entire TCM community must eliminate prejudice, not cut off any link, and comprehensively review the many legacies left to us by our ancestors, so that the shattered mirror of Chinese medicine can be reunited and no longer split, maintaining its integrity.

　　Second, the Issue of Exchange Between TCM and Western Medicine

Now, I will discuss this issue from the perspective of traumatology. There are three situations for the exchange between TCM and Western medicine:

1.  The inherent academic knowledge of TCM that Western medicine does not currently possess. TCM should do its best to faithfully introduce it. For example, how to deal with internal injuries in traumatology and its theoretical basis, why it has existed for more than a thousand years and still exists, and has penetrated into the people. I have repeatedly recommended it to Western medicine colleagues at Shanghai First Medical College for their reference to supplement what they lack. I hope that Western medicine colleagues will consider accepting or criticizing it.
2.  The techniques that Western medicine possesses but TCM does not, such as X-ray radiography. In complex cases of fractures and dislocations, if it is indeed necessary, we can use X-ray radiography to assist in diagnosis, which is also to supplement what we lack. For the sake of the people's health, I think this is acceptable, but we should pay attention to not abusing the techniques that TCM does not possess, which would lead to waste.
3.  What TCM has and Western medicine also has, and can be combined, or can be combined through research. For example, the names and locations of bones, etc., used in traumatology. If TCM calls it the zygomatic bone, and Western medicine also calls it the zygomatic bone, then we know it is the same without explanation. The TCM term kneecap and the Western medicine term patella, we can understand it with just a little thought. The TCM term kneecap refers to two bones, and Western medicine says the patella is also two bones, completely the same. The TCM term metacarpal bone refers to ten bones, and the Western medicine term metacarpal bone also refers to ten bones, completely the same. For things that need to be researched, for example, what is the TCM term "jinmo" (tendons and membranes) in Western medicine? With just a little explanation, it can be fully understood. In this regard, I think the combination of TCM and Western medicine is entirely possible; but we must avoid arbitrary attachments, which will lead to unnecessary disputes.

Therefore, I believe that academic exchanges between TCM and Western medicine can overcome difficulties when there are certain favorable conditions. As long as TCM and Western medicine can unite closely and exchange sincerely, although the theoretical systems may be different, they will gradually reach a consensus.

　　Third, the Issue of Economical Use of Chinese Herbal Medicine

Chinese herbal medicine is an effective weapon for TCM to treat diseases and save lives. With the development of national economic construction, the lives of the broad masses of people have gradually improved, and the consumption of Chinese herbal medicine has also been quite alarming. However, there are also phenomena of waste. When I saw the news in the *Liberation Daily* on February 17, 1957, "Not Paying Out of Their Own Pockets, Wasting Public Money, Some Patients Wasting Chinese Medicine," I felt very touched. It makes the significance of advocating the economical use of Chinese herbal medicine even more profound. Take ginseng and prepared Rehmannia root, for example, everyone knows that they are tonics, but TCM sometimes uses these two herbs as life-saving medicines. Because everyone wants to use ginseng and prepared Rehmannia root for tonification, ginseng is in short supply and prepared Rehmannia root is out of stock. At critical moments, there is nothing to use. Of course, it is okay to use ginseng and prepared Rehmannia root for tonification when necessary. The problem is that sometimes ginseng and prepared Rehmannia root do not need to be used for tonification, but patients also request to use ginseng and prepared Rehmannia root for tonification. This massive "waste" has caused shortages and stockouts. The reason why other commonly used drugs are in tight supply is also mostly due to overuse that is unnecessary. Therefore, on the one hand, we ask various units to assist in reasoning with patients, and on the other hand, we TCM practitioners must also be good at mastering and saving as much unnecessary Chinese herbal medicine as possible. At the same time, regarding the source of Chinese herbal medicine, I hope that the relevant leading organizations will vigorously encourage and support farmers in production, which is also the main aspect. This not only conforms to the principle of increasing production and practicing economy, but also saves the country a lot of wealth, and can also save many patients' lives in times of urgent need. Why not do both at once?

Finally, I wish the conference a complete success and all the delegates good health. (Attached picture)

### 消除成见更好地为人民健康服务　石筱山的发言

　　消除成见更好地为人民健康服务
　　石筱山的发言
    我完全同意周总理和陈副主席等所作的报告。这次大会开幕之前，在扩大最高国务会议上，听到了毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的重要指示，使我能明确分清敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部的矛盾，在思想认识上，有了进一步的提高，感到非常兴奋。
    我现在就中医中药问题，提出几点不成熟的看法和肤浅的意见，是否恰当希望各位加以指正。
　  第一、中医内部的问题
    我自开业以来，从数十年的过程中所看到，不可讳言，情况是复杂的。解放以前，中医学术是不易统一的，你有你一套，我有我一套，于是产生了所谓“医经家”、“经方家”、“时方家”、“中西汇通家”。虽然“四家”各有其一面的优点，然而总究倾轧攻讦的机会较多。在偏面发挥的情况下自身也暴露了不少弱点。
    如“医经家”自己喜欢说某些地方一定是道教的思想。内经素问大致可以决定是战国至西汉时的作品，道教是东汉张道陵开始才有的，我不知道西汉以前的作品，何以会受东汉道教影响，真是百思不得其解，毋怪要给他家说成“玄学”作为被攻讦的对象了。
    “经方家”的伤寒论分六经，有特别强调和内经无关，只袭其名而已，不能用热论来解释。我虽然不够领会伤寒论的精神，然而我翻了翻伤寒论的白文，看到六经各篇中有“针足阳明”、“刺期门”等，我想针刺也是“随症治之”的方法，足阳明和期门不知道和经脉有没有关系，假使是有关系的就不单只袭其名了。“时方家”的温病条辨中尽多是桂枝汤、白虎加人参汤、栀子豉汤、大承气汤等经方，难道温病条辨中的桂枝汤和伤寒论里的桂枝汤有两样吗？如果没有两样，那末古方不能治今病之说不攻自破。
    “中西汇通家”说三焦是纲油或淋巴腺或者尚有可原，驯至一切都以西说为主，单单采用中药治病，因此汇通的意义像大海里捞针了。
    能成“家”固然是好事，像金元四家的争鸣，各有各的发明各有各的创造。不应该死执一面，形成割据。互相攻讦，于事无补，好事就变了坏事。解放后，王斌思想得到批判，中医铁树开花，重又抬头，中医过去的不少好处陆续在发掘出来，而历史条件所造成的“四家”不免有些夹杂其间。因此，中医内部不但理论上有争执，临症时就更多差别。中医过去是一盘散沙，同时又将被淘汰，自然不觉得你说你有理，我说我有理究竟那一个是对或不对；于今在同一目标下，就产生了各搞各的不能一致，病态百出影响了中医内部的团结。虽然也知道各执己见、互相排斥是错误的，毕竟这种错误至多停留在认识阶段，没有推前一步，这是大大的辜负了党对中医的关心。做一个中医的我太觉置身无地了，为此，要求全体中医界必须消除成见，不可割断任何一个环节，全面的来温习祖先交给我们的许多遗产，使祖国医学破镜重圆不再分裂，保持它的完整性。
  　第二、中西医的交流问题
    现在我就以伤科的角度来谈这个问题。中西医之间的交流，有下面三种情况：
    1、中医固有的学术，目前西医尚未具备的，中医应尽自己所能忠实的介绍，如伤科内伤的处理和它的理论基础怎样，何以一千多年前已有，至今还存在，并已深入民间，我已在上海第一医学院陆续作过很多次的推荐给西医同道参考，备其未备，希望西医同道考虑接受或批判。
    2、中医没有而西医所具备的技术，如X光摄片，在骨折脱臼发生的复杂情况下，如确有必要，可以借重X光摄片帮助诊断，也是备其未备，为了对人民健康负责，我想是可以的，但应该注意的不要滥用中医所未备的技术，反致造成浪费。
    3、中医有西医也有，而可以结合，或通过研究可以结合的，如伤科中应用骨骼等的名称和部位，如中医叫颧骨，西医也叫颧骨，不用说明，就知道是一样的。中医的膝盖骨和西医的髌骨，我们只消想一想就能知道。中医的膝盖骨是两块，西医说髌骨也是两块；中医的手掌骨是十块，西医的掌骨也是十块，完全一样。要通过研究的，譬如中医说“筋膜”是西医的什么，只稍加说明也完全可以了解。就此而论，中医和西医结合是完全可能的；但必须避免随便附会，以致有不必要的争论。
    于此，我认为中西医的学术交流，在具备一定的有利条件时，困难是可以克服的，只要中西医能紧密团结在一起，互相诚意交流，虽然理论体系容有不同，渐渐会取得一致的。
  　第三、节约使用中药问题
    中药是中医所掌握治病救命的有效武器。随着国家经济建设的发展，广大人民的生活已逐步提高，于是中药的消耗量也颇惊人。然而其中也有浪费的现象。当我看到1957年2月17日解放日报“自己不掏腰包，浪费公家钱钞，有些病人糟蹋中药”的消息，就觉得非常感触。使我们要提倡节约使用中药的意义，更来得深长了。就拿人参熟地来说，大家知道是补药，但中医使用这二味有时可以当作救命药。因为大家要用人参熟地来调补，以至人参缺货熟地断档，在紧要关头，要用时反而没有东西用。当然有必要用人参熟地调补时是可以用的，问题在有时可以不用人参熟地来调补的，病家也要求用人参熟地来补，这样大量“糟蹋”，造成了缺货断档。其他常用药的所以供应紧张，也大都是发生在可不用而滥用上。因此一方面我们要求各单位协助，替病人讲理，一方面我们中医也要自己善于掌握，尽量把不必要用的中药节省下来。同时对中药的来源问题，希望有关的领导机构，对药农生产上大力的鼓励和支持，这也是主要的方面。这样不但符合增产节约的原则，还可以替国家省下许多财富，而在急需时也可以救了病人的许多生命，一举两得何乐不为。
    最后，谨祝大会胜利成功，各位委员身体健康。（附图片）
