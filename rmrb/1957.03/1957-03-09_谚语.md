    Proverbs
    A person with a small alcohol tolerance will feel dizzy after only two cups; an arrogant person will become conceited and lose all sense of proportion after only a little praise.
                          ＊
    A modest person always learns ten and counts it as one,
    A complacent person always learns one and counts it as ten.
                          ＊
    A warhorse on the battlefield still wants to gallop even with tight reins,
    A lazy pig sleeping doesn't want to move even when driven to eat.
                          ＊
    With reason, you can go anywhere in the world; without reason, you can't move an inch.
                          ＊
    Without sincerity, nothing can be accomplished; without humility, nothing can be known.
    We don't rely on heaven for food; we rely entirely on the movement of our hands.
                          ＊
    If you don't recite for three days, your mouth becomes rusty; if you don't do it for three days, your hands become clumsy.
                          ＊
    One person's plan is not as good as two people's, three people can come up with a great idea.
                          ＊
    A thousand-pound rope breaks from the thinnest part.
