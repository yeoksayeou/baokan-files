The phenomenon of early marriage is extremely common.

With the victory of national economic construction, the people have been liberated from poverty. While raising the requirements for material and cultural life, they generally want to resolve the issue of marriage and love earlier. In the past, some people could not get married due to economic difficulties, but now, as long as they find a partner, marriage is no longer a problem. However, in the past two or three years, the phenomenon of early marriage has been quite common among cadres and workers, especially in factories and enterprises with many young workers and in medical and health institutions with more female cadres. According to what I know, among more than 80 unmarried young female cadres in a hospital, only 5% are unmarried. Among the 22 graduates of the nursing school run by the hospital in 1953, more than 10 got married upon graduation. Therefore, a trend has formed in the hospital: those who marry early and whose partner is a section chief become "section chief's wives" early, and those whose partner is a party branch secretary become "secretary's wives" early, considering this the highest glory, and even being proud of it among their classmates. Therefore, most of the others got married in the next two or three years. By 1956, only one of the 22 people had not yet married. Most of them married at the age of 18 or 19, and some were very eager. Even if they had not reached the age of 18 when they found a partner, they had already completed their relationship as husband and wife. As soon as they reached the age of 18, they immediately got married quickly on the orders of their "children."

In 1956, farmers joined cooperatives, and their production was guaranteed. Their economic conditions improved unprecedentedly, and young people in rural areas were also eager to marry early. On the one hand, elderly farmers hoped that their sons would marry early so that they could hold their grandchildren sooner; on the other hand, early marriage meant one more labor force. Some cooperative leaders were unwilling to lend money for other matters of the members, but were very willing to lend money for marriage, because this could enrich the cooperative's workforce. Those who were not yet 18 years old were reluctantly considered to be 18 years old according to the old calculation method and got married. From the above situation, the phenomenon of early marriage among cadres, workers, and peasants is relatively common. The state stipulates that one must be 18 years old to get married, which is the minimum age for marriage, and it is not unwelcome to marry at an older age.

The harms of early marriage

Early marriage has adverse effects in all aspects. According to what we have seen, there are the following situations:

1.  The impact of early marriage on learning and work: Early marriage leads to early childbirth; early childbirth also leads to more births. We have already proposed contraception to address overpopulation. Overpopulation is related to early marriage. Early childbirth has a greater impact on work and learning. Many young women had great enthusiasm for learning before marriage, and set learning plans, such as how to enter high school, when to take the university entrance exam, etc. After getting married and having children, they no longer talked about learning, and even did not participate in professional learning in their own units. In terms of work, they work seven hours a day from the seventh month of pregnancy, and have nearly two months of maternity leave during childbirth. They also do not work night shifts before and after childbirth, and are given a certain amount of time to breastfeed every day within six months after childbirth. Although all of this is necessary and reasonable, it cannot be said that it has no impact on work.

2.  The impact of early marriage on physical and mental development: After women whose bodies have not fully developed get married, their endocrine function changes, and their physical development is hindered. Many women who are thin and small stop developing and do not grow taller; even affecting the children they give birth to, who also do not develop well. If early marriage continues from generation to generation, it may further have a certain impact on the development of the race. Mothers who are very young are still big children themselves and lack experience and knowledge in raising children. They only know how to "give birth" but not how to "raise." Therefore, the quality of their children will not be high in terms of health or education.

    Some women who marry early are already mothers of three or four children before the age of twenty-two or twenty-three. Her intellectual development is naturally hindered due to lack of learning opportunities, and her ideological development is also unlikely to be healthy. In addition to using her energy at work, she has to spend most of her time educating her children. A young girl in her youth is therefore prematurely "maternalized," and some women's emotions turn to depression and they age prematurely. A bud has not yet blossomed before it bears fruit, which is not a normal physiological development.

3.  Early marriage may lead to some social problems: Young couples are not yet economically affluent, and having children increases the economic burden, so it is conceivable that many social problems will arise. In addition, because women who marry early are prone to aging, it may cause many men to engage in some improper relationships between men and women, which is also a common social problem.

A more appropriate age for marriage

In general, early marriage has certain adverse effects in all aspects. But what age is more appropriate for marriage?

In addition to India and some countries in the tropics, because their young people mature early, most countries in temperate and cold regions stipulate that marriage is only allowed above the age of eighteen or nineteen. But in fact, very few Western countries marry under the age of twenty. Their custom is that men marry only when they can live independently. Therefore, in general, men marry above the age of twenty-eight and women marry above the age of twenty-five. In my personal opinion, according to the geographical and climatic relationship of our country and the development of our people, if men and women have indeed developed well, it is reasonable to marry at the age of eighteen as stipulated by the constitution; but in general, it is more appropriate for men to marry at the age of twenty-five or twenty-six and women to marry at the age of twenty-two or twenty-three. This is of course a one-sided view. Other factors such as economic conditions, the impact on learning, and other social backgrounds should naturally also be considered. Our country has advocated since ancient times that men marry at the age of thirty and women marry at the age of twenty, which is also worth our reference. (Attached picture)

    早婚会给青年男女带来什么不好影响？
    王宝楹的发言
    早婚现象极为普遍
    随着全国经济建设的胜利，人民从贫困中解放了出来；在提高了物质文化生活要求的同时，对婚姻恋爱问题一般也要求早些解决。过去有些人由于经济困难不能结婚的，现在只要找到了爱人，结婚就不成问题了。但是最近两三年来在干部与工人群众中，早婚的现象相当普遍，尤其在青年工人多的工厂企业中和妇女干部比较多的医疗卫生机构中更为普遍。据我所熟悉的一个医院内青年妇女干部八十多人中未婚的只占5％，该院自办的护士学校1953年有二十二人毕业，毕业就结婚的有十余人之多。因此在院内造成了一种风气，早结了婚，对象是科长的，便早成了“科长夫人”，对象是支部书记的，便早成为“书记夫人”，认为这是无上的光荣；甚而在她们同学中引以为自豪。所以其余的人大部分也接着在两三年内结了婚，到1956年止二十二人中只有一人尚未结婚，她们多数在十八、九岁结婚，有些要求很急，找到爱人虽未满十八岁，即已经完成了夫妇关系。等一到十八岁立即奉“子女”之命迅速结婚。
    1956年农民都加入了合作社，他们增产有了保证，经济状况有了空前的改善，农村青年也急急于早婚。一方面由于老年农民希望儿子早结婚，可以早抱孙子；另一方面早结了婚多一个劳动力。有些合作社的领导人对社员的其他事情不肯贷款，对结婚的就很愿意贷款，因为这样可以充实合作社的工作力量，未满十八足岁的，也勉强的按照旧式计算法凑了十八岁就结婚。从以上这些情况看，在干部、工人、农民中早婚的现象是比较普遍的，国家规定满十八岁才可以结婚，这是结婚的最低年龄，不是不欢迎年龄大些再结婚。
    早婚的害处
    早婚对各方面有不良影响，据我们所看到的有下列几种情况：
    1、早婚对于学习和工作的影响：早结婚，就会早生育；生育早，也就比较生育的多。我们已经针对生育过剩，提倡避孕。生育过剩与早婚有连带关系。生育过早对工作、对学习影响更大。很多青年妇女未结婚前学习劲头很大，定下了学习计划，如何进高中，何时考大学等等。结了婚再生了孩子，就不谈学习了，甚而在本单位的业务学习也不参加了。对工作方面，怀孕七个月即每天工作七小时，分娩时又有将近两个月的产假，产前产后还不作夜班，产后在六个月之内每天给一定的喂奶时间。这一切虽然都是必要的，也是合理的，但对工作不能说没有一定的影响。
    2、早婚对身体精神发育的影响：身体未发育好的女子结婚后内分泌机能有变动，身体的发育受到阻碍。有许多身体瘦小的妇女，停止了发育，身体长不大；甚而影响到她自己生的孩子，也发育不好。如果代代早婚，可能进一步对种族的发育也起一定的影响。年纪很轻的母亲，她自己还是一个大孩子，缺乏教养孩子的经验和知识，只会“生”不会“养”。因此她们的孩子不论在健康方面，或是教育方面，质量不会高的。
    早婚的女子有些未到二十二、三岁已经是三、四个孩子的母亲了。她本人智慧的发育自然因为缺乏学习机会而受阻碍，在思想发育方面也不可能健康。她的精力除了用在工作上以外，不得不拿出大部分来去教养孩子。一个正在青春的少女因此也提早“母性”化了，有些妇女情绪转变为忧郁，也提前衰老了，一个花苞尚未盛开就结了果子，这不是正常生理的发展。
    3、早婚可能招致一些社会问题：青年的夫妇经济方面尚不十分充裕，生了孩子增加经济上负担，因此引起许多社会问题是可以想到的。此外由于早婚的妇女容易衰老，可能引起许多男子搞出一些不正当的男女关系来，这也是常见的社会问题。
    比较适当的结婚年龄
    总起来说，过早结婚对各方面有一定的不良影响。但是什么年龄结婚比较适当呢？
    世界各国除了印度及一些在热带的国家外，因为他们的青年早熟；在温寒地带的多数国家规定十八、九岁以上才准许结婚，但事实上西洋国家在二十岁以内结婚的极少。他们的习惯男子能独立生活了才结婚。所以一般情况男子在二十八岁以上，女子在二十五岁以上才结婚。我个人的意见按我国的地理气候关系，及我国人民的发育情况，如男女确已发育很好，按宪法规定十八岁结婚是合理的；但一般来看男子在二十五、六岁，女子二十二、三岁结婚比较适当。这当然是片面的看法。其他因素例如经济情况、对学习的影响以及其他社会背景等等，自然也应该考虑在内。我国古来就主张男子三十而婚，女子二十而嫁，也值得我们参考。（附图片）
