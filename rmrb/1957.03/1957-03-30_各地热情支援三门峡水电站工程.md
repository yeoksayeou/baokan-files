Xinhua News Agency, Sanmenxia, 29th. All parts of the country are enthusiastically supporting the construction of the Sanmenxia Hydroelectric Station.

Currently, workers in fifty factories across the country are working overtime to produce orders for the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau. The first pipe cutting machine manufactured in China by the Shanghai No. 1 Machine Tool Manufacturing Company will be used first at the Sanmenxia construction site. The Northeast State-owned Siping Machinery Factory and the Shanghai Joint State-Private New Construction Shipbuilding Factory have both sent responsible cadres to the Sanmenxia construction site several times to study the manufacturing of orders to ensure they are suitable.

The main materials needed for the construction of over 90,000 square meters of housing in Sanmenxia are all supplied from other places. Hubei Province reduced its own bamboo consumption for this purpose, and promptly transported 60,000 bamboo poles. The Luoyang Railway Branch managed to add 193 additional train carriages to the Sanmenxia project outside of the transportation plan, ensuring a supply of 40,000 bricks per day to the construction site for a certain period. Shanxi Province supplied all the straw and fodder for building the houses. The Shanghai Metals Company Hardware and Plumbing Materials Store reduced its retail quantities and supplied the Sanmenxia project with 1,500 hard-to-buy water taps and galvanized iron elbows and other hardware. Party and government leaders at all levels in Henan Province made arrangements for supporting Sanmenxia in several professional meetings on supply, marketing, and transportation. When transportation at the construction site was strained, they promptly dispatched twenty large trucks to provide support.

In winter, tomatoes and Chinese chives and other vegetables can often be eaten in the Sanmenxia construction area, which is the result of support from Luoyang, Xi'an and other places. The Luoyang Vegetable Company once reduced the local supply of vegetables to support the Sanmenxia construction site. The Gansu Province Gangu Vegetable Company also gave priority to supplying potatoes to the Sanmenxia construction site.

About 2,000 cadres from the local Party and government organizations in the Sanmenxia construction area, of which more than 1,800 people were put into supporting the work of Sanmenxia. Local residents also voluntarily vacated many houses for the families of workers to live in.

In addition, the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau constantly receives letters from all over the country expressing deep concern for the Sanmenxia project. The letter writers include basic construction workers, automobile and telephone repair workers, production team leaders from agricultural cooperatives, scaffolders, farmers from the Yellow River flooded areas, housewives, and entire squads of Young Pioneers. All the letters are filled with enthusiastic language. A young man named Di Haikun said in his letter: "I am willing to dedicate my youth to the motherland and personally put a brick and a tile on this historically significant building."

　　各地热情支援三门峡水电站工程
    新华社三门峡29日电  全国各地都在热情地支援兴修三门峡水电站的工程。
    现在，全国有五十个工厂的工人在加紧赶制三门峡工程局的订货。上海第一机床制造公司试制的中国第一部切管机，将首先在三门峡工地使用。东北国营四平机械工厂、上海公私合营新建船舶修建厂为使订货适用，都曾先后几次派过负责干部来三门峡工地研究订货的制造。
    三门峡新建九万多平方公尺面积房屋所需的主要器材，全部由外地供给。湖北省为此曾压缩了本省的用竹量，及时运来了六万根竹子。洛阳铁路分局在运输计划以外，设法给三门峡工程增加了一百九十三个车皮，保证了有一个时期内工地每天用砖四万块的供应量。山西省供应了全部的建房草料。上海市五金公司水暖器材商店压缩了零售数量，供给三门峡工程一千五百件在市面上不容易买到的自来水头和白铁湾头等五金器材。河南省各级党政领导曾在多次供销、运输等专业会议上，作过支援三门峡的工作布置，正当工地运输紧张的时候，又及时调来了二十部大卡车来支援。
    冬天，在三门峡工区可以经常吃到西红柿和韭黄等蔬菜，这是洛阳、西安等地支援的结果。洛阳蔬菜公司曾一度压缩本地的蔬菜供应量，来支援三门峡工地。甘肃省的甘古蔬菜公司也首先把土豆供给了三门峡工地。
    三门峡工区当地的党、政机关约两千多名干部，其中有一千八百多人投入了支援三门峡的工作。当地居民也自动让出了许多房屋给工人家属居住。
    另外，三门峡工程局不断地收到来自全国各地的表示深切关怀三门峡工程的信件。写信的人包括基本建设工人，汽车、电话修配工人，农业社的生产队长，架子工，黄泛区的农民，家庭主妇和整班整队的少先队队员们。所有信上都是热情洋溢的语言。一个青年狄海坤的信上说：“我愿意将自己的青春献给祖国，亲自把一块砖、一块瓦放到这一有历史意义的建筑上”。
