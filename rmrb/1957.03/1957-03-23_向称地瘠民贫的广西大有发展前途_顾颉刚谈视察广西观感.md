Gu Jiegang Discusses His Impressions of Guangxi After Inspection

Last year, I read the "Suggestions on the Second Five-Year Plan for Developing the National Economy" passed by the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and Premier Zhou Enlai's "Report on the Suggestions on the Second Five-Year Plan for Developing the National Economy." This time, I also heard Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Explanation on Several Issues of the Second Five-Year Plan," which made me clearly understand the goal of our country's construction, from a backward agricultural country to an advanced socialist industrial country, and the steps are both active and reliable. I very much want to exert my meager strength in this socialist construction movement, so I will combine what I have personally seen and heard with this great instruction to talk about my views.

In May of last year, I inspected the Northeast and saw the rapid progress of industrial, mining, agricultural, and forestry production, which reached an astonishing level. I deeply realized the superiority of the socialist system and gained the most sincere understanding of the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, and the selfless labor of the working comrades. I really couldn't imagine that in the ruins cruelly destroyed by the enemy, after only a few short years after liberation, there would be such grand and meticulous industrial achievements. In extreme excitement, I only rejoiced that I could be a person of the new China, and rejoiced that I could still be a member of a certain department in the great national construction cause.

Because I had already seen the advanced areas of industry and agriculture in our country, I intentionally chose a relatively backward area of production to compare. Therefore, in November last year, I went to Guangxi for inspection, because since ancient times, Guangxi has always been called "barren land and impoverished people." Along the way, my friends and I discussed the reasons for this poverty, and we knew that there were many karst mountainous areas in Guangxi, with countless small mountains and rocks standing on the plains; even the vast plains would reveal stones after digging a few feet. The soil was too thin, and it was not easy to dig wells. People living in the karst mountainous areas often had to carry water from ten or twenty miles away for drinking water, and even accidents of robbing water halfway occurred. Some people dug holes in the rocky mountains, filled them with soil, and planted crops. It took the labor of two generations of father and son to cultivate two mu of land, which was like the joke of "drilling holes to plant whiskers." Moreover, because Guangxi has high mountains and steep slopes, wide land and sparse population, it is not easy to rapidly develop water conservancy and eliminate pests and diseases. Therefore, droughts, floods, wind disasters, insect disasters, and animal disasters attacked in various ways, causing disasters every year and requiring relief every year. Under such circumstances, how could it not be called "barren land and impoverished people"? It formed a stark contrast with the richness and prosperity of the Northeast.

What I said above was a fact in the past, and it is still a fact now. The general impression of Guangxi is only "Guilin's scenery is the best in the world, and Yangshuo's scenery is the best in Guilin." It seems that Guangxi can only play a role in sightseeing, and there is nothing else that should be paid attention to, that is to say, it is of no great help to the construction cause of the new China. However, this time I inspected Guangxi and traveled to more than a dozen counties and cities. The more I traveled, the more I felt that the so-called "barren land and impoverished people" was only a superficial phenomenon, a temporary phenomenon, and a result of not fully utilizing human resources and using science and technology to make proper arrangements. It has almost the same resources as the Northeast, and its location in the Southwest gives it more favorable conditions than the Northeast, and its development prospects are infinite. The Communist Party of China has unparalleled perseverance, and the people of Guangxi have the traditional spirit of enduring hardship and hard work. If the central government puts more effort into Guangxi, transforming nature and tapping potential, I dare say that Guangxi will inevitably become a second Northeast. Now, I will try to report what I have seen at this meeting for everyone to discuss.

What does Guangxi Province have?

Rich mineral resources, which can be developed into a heavy industrial zone

It is true that there are many rocky mountains in Guangxi, which are not suitable for farming, but the rocky mountains themselves are a raw material for production. Isn't our country currently lacking limestone and cement for infrastructure construction? Rocky mountains can just supply this need. If several large-scale limestone and cement plants are built there, I dare say that these raw materials will not be used up for ten thousand years. As for earthen mountains, there are too many minerals there. Manganese is an indispensable material for steelmaking, and our country's production ranks first in the world, and Guangxi Province's production ranks first in China. Tungsten has the same effect as manganese, and Guangxi's output is also considerable. Only because the province has not established a steel plant, these products can only be sent to the Northeast for use. Yunnan is most famous for copper and tin mines, and western Guangxi is adjacent to Yunnan, so naturally there are also many. Lead and zinc production is also rich. Liuzhou has a zinc factory. Because the leaders and workers are willing to work hard to explore, the quality of the Banana brand zinc oxide powder produced has reached the world level and sells well abroad. In addition, minerals such as coal, petroleum, gypsum, aluminum, antimony, placer gold, mercury, crystal, and various rare metals are being discovered one after another as the exploration teams travel. They said: Although Guangxi does not have a steel capital and a coal capital like the Northeast, the types of minerals are no less than those in the Northeast, and the conditions for establishing a heavy industrial zone are available.

Trees grow rapidly, and the future is an important forest base in the South

Let's say that minerals are not the focus of Guangxi's production, let's look at the forests. Guangxi is a mountainous area, and the area south of Liuzhou is subtropical. The annual growth rate of wood is fast, and the annual felling volume is also large. It is estimated that the area of suitable forest land is about 120 million mu. The amount of wood has not been precisely surveyed, and some people say it is 180 million cubic meters. At present, the annual output of timber in the province is only about one million cubic meters, but the Hongshui River and Nanpan River alone have 45 million cubic meters, which can be rotated for 30 years, and the annual production can reach 1.5 million cubic meters. The only difficulty is that the current transportation is inconvenient, and it cannot be transported out after felling. The vigorous development of waterways is needed. The main tree species in Guangxi are fir, Masson pine, and Yunnan pine, which can be felled 15 to 20 years after afforestation, which is much faster than in the Northeast. The only difference is that the forests in the Northeast are in large areas, while those in Guangxi grow in small patches; but as long as artificial greening is carried out, it can be the same as the Northeast in 20 years, and then a large amount of mechanized logging can be carried out. While felling, while cultivating, the old ones have not been felled, and the new ones have become timber. It is really an inexhaustible source of profit. Therefore, from a development point of view, our country's future forest industry should take the southern provinces as the main base, and Guangxi and Yunnan provinces occupy the widest subtropical area in the country, and should especially be the main base in the south.

Economic plants are extremely abundant

Between forests and horticulture are economic crops, which are Guangxi's greatest source of profit, and its benefits are even greater than forests. Only Hainan Island can be compared in the whole country. Sugarcane is the raw material for sugar making. Guixian, Guiping and other places have built factories to manufacture a large amount, which is known to everyone. Rubber is planted very vigorously, and its cold resistance is getting stronger year by year. It was not harmed in the great cold wave in January of the year before last, which shows that it is suitable for planting. Zizhu, also known as wood bean, is strong in toughness and can be used as an adhesive. Putting it in rubber can double its effectiveness. For example, a rubber wheel should travel 10,000 kilometers, and if zizhu is melted into it, it can travel 20,000 kilometers. Anise, that is, fennel, can be used as a spice, it can also be steamed for oil, and it can also be used as an explosive. This can only be planted in southwestern Guangxi in the whole country. Eucalyptus trees are planted everywhere. Their trunks can be used as railway sleepers and building materials. Among them, lemon eucalyptus leaves can be made into lemon oil for surgical use. 櫶木is the most solid kind of tree, which can be used as the frame of the machine. Cork oak grows all over the mountains and fields in the northern counties of the Bose area. It is an industrial cork, and it also contains tannin, which can be used as a raw material for leather making. Now it cannot be used and can only be cut down for firewood. Sisal is a hard fiber plant with the strongest tensile force, resistant to alkaline corrosion, and resistant to water. It can be used as ship cables, fishing nets, and ropes used in mining and forestry industries. Coffee is planted a lot in southern Guangxi. The high quality coffee is comparable to the best coffee in the United States. One mu of land can plant 120 plants. In a good harvest year, each plant can harvest 20 catties, and each catty is priced at 1.4 yuan. The output value per mu is more than 3,000 yuan, far exceeding the price of grain. Ironwood and Accra can be used as shade trees for coffee. They are taller than humans one year after planting. Accra is also a raw material for leather making. Sea island cotton can have a small harvest in the first year of planting, and it will be in full production in the second year. Each plant can harvest one and a half catties of cotton. Medicinal materials currently have 680 kinds, and 114 kinds are shipped to the Soviet Union, Southeast Asia, and other brother countries. Among the 395 kinds of commonly used Chinese medicines in the country, there are 166 kinds. The most precious one is Tianqi, a special medicine for treating internal and external injuries. It is sold in Southeast Asia and other places. The value of each 100 catties is as high as 12,000 yuan. Other Eucommia ulmoides, cinnamon, tea pepper, Shouwu, gecko, and armor pieces have abundant production. As for spice crops, flax crops, and feed crops, they are countless for a while, and it can be truly said to be "endowed by nature." Guangxi's barren hills and wastelands still have 110 million mu, and most of these economic crops only need dry and barren soil and do not occupy paddy fields. If planned artificial breeding is carried out, it will be of great benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

Economic animal species are also numerous

Because of the vast barren hills and wastelands, there is grass everywhere, and animal husbandry is developing accordingly. Cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, and sheep are all produced, and the leather industry has a fairly developed foundation. There are many ponds, which can be used to raise ducks. I went to a Miao agricultural cooperative in Longlin, where there are 10,000 ducks. It can be seen that the number of poultry in the province is huge, but duck feathers have not been utilized. Pork is thin-skinned and tastes fresh, and it has always been sold to other provinces and overseas. Now the central and provincial parties have repeatedly called for raising pigs, and the quantity and quality of pigs will definitely increase greatly in the future. Wild animals include tigers, bears, deer, monkeys, wild boars, pythons, civet cats, etc. Monkeys were originally one of the animal disasters, but now, because foreign countries purchase them, farmers lure them to drink alcohol, catch them after they are drunk, and become a source of wealth. Even in the fishery industry, after Qinzhou Prefecture was assigned to Guangdong the year before last, Guangxi no longer has a coastline, and everyone thought there was no future. However, the weather in southern Guangxi is warm, and fish fry can easily grow up. One-inch seedlings can grow to more than ten catties in one or two years, so raising them there for one year is equal to raising them in Jiangsu for two years. There is another feature, like Zhejiang and Sichuan, rice fields can raise fish, and each mu can harvest more than 200 catties. There are about 24 million mu of rice fields in the province. If they are generally utilized, wouldn't it be the best sideline for farmers! Therefore, Guangxi's production should pay special attention to the development of economic plants and economic animals. They are the production departments with decisive significance for Guangxi's economy and should be supported by the central government and the attention of the people of the whole country.

Crops are harvested four times a year

Let's go back to the crops. It is true that some places have thin soil and lack of water, and they often encounter disasters, but because they are in the subtropics, the annual rainfall reaches 1,500 to 2,000 mm, and they can be produced in all seasons. There are many places where two and three crops are planted. In the Guinan area, rice can be planted in early, middle, late, and winter crops. Corn can also be harvested four times in early, middle, late, and autumn. In addition, there are crops such as wheat, beans, potatoes, and melons. Disasters do not occur all year round. The loss in this season can be compensated in another season. In the past, some areas did not apply fertilizer to the fields, and the sowing was sparse, so production was low. Since the cooperativization, the call for accumulating fertilizer has been made, toilets have been set up everywhere, and the planting method has been changed to small plants and dense planting, changing one foot wide to six inches, resulting in more than double the production. In addition, a large number of medium and small-sized water conservancy projects have been constructed. In the past year alone, the province completed 160,000 projects, benefiting an area of 9 million mu. As for large-scale water conservancy projects, such as the construction of the Huangsang River Reservoir in Tianyang, farmers have enough food and clothing, and the local thatched houses have gradually been replaced by tiled houses. The construction of the Laohuling Reservoir in Yongning not only was not affected by the severe drought last year, but also increased production by one time in the irrigated fields. Therefore, although the land in Guangxi is said to be quite barren, as long as water conservancy construction is carried out, the disaster problem can be easily solved, and it can also be used to generate electricity, so it should be optimistic after all.

Male and female farmers have developed a hardworking character

Let's talk about the labor force of the Guangxi people, which is another commendable thing. Other places have busy and slack seasons for farming. Like the northern provinces, they only plant one season and are idle for half a year. Guangxi can be planted in four seasons, and labor is required at any time. There are also many disasters, which require resistance at any time, which has trained the people to have a very hardworking character. I walked in the mountainous areas and saw women carrying stone baskets weighing more than their weight while walking, in addition to handling housework and social affairs. At the same time, they also used their free hands to split green hemp. In other provinces, elderly women must have bound feet, but in Guangxi, not to mention the countryside, even in the cities, I have never seen an old woman with bound feet in her 70s or 80s, which shows that they have always had a tradition of diligent labor. If women are like this, men can be known. What we saw along the way was that the Miao and Yao ethnic groups lived on the tops of mountains, spent a lot of effort to obtain very little water, but they managed the terraced fields and sideline businesses very well. After the free market was opened, many people in the countryside went to the cities to sell goods. In order to save money, they did not stay in hotels and often spent the night sitting on the open ground. From these places, we can see how hard their lives are and how they have cultivated the virtues of diligence and thrift. In the future, after the province is industrialized, they will inevitably show outstanding labor and creation in the factories, and countless labor models and advanced workers will emerge, playing a demonstrative role in the national workers' team.

The Bose area is expected to become the railway network center in the southwest corner of our country

Let's talk about Guangxi's transportation. The existing routes are seasonal and cannot be open all year round; there are also many dangerous beaches and cannot be open on the entire line. The highways are limited by funding and are not up to standard, and they are accessible on sunny days and blocked on rainy days in mountainous areas. These phenomena must of course be improved. The railways include the Xiang-Gui line connecting Hunan in the north and Vietnam in the south, the Qian-Gui line connecting Guizhou in the northwest, and the Li-Zhan line connecting the Leizhou Peninsula in the southwest. Zhanjiang Port is a deep-water ice-free port, and it is the shortest route for ships coming to the mainland of China from Europe and Southeast Asia. Therefore, the Xiang-Gui and Li-Zhan lines are the south gates of China, that is, the east and west gates of Guangxi, which have a great relationship with the industrial and agricultural development of the province. However, is it enough to develop Guangxi with only these three railways? I don't think it's enough at all. Because to build the southwest corner of China, from the perspective of topography and production, the three provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi should be integrated into one. Guangxi's Bose is an important area. It is located in the center of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture. This area is the most abundant in products and the most important to develop. It also connects Xingyi, Guizhou to Kunming, Yunnan in the northwest, and connects Boai (Boai), Yunnan in the southwest, where goods from Yunnan and Guizhou provinces are concentrated. Therefore, it is now a center for the transfer of materials and will surely become the largest industrial area in Guangxi in the future, that is, the appropriate center of the railway network in the southwest corner of China. I believe that in the second five-year plan, the radiation lines centered on Bose should be designed and measured so that it connects Nanning in the southeast, Hechi in the northeast, Guizhou in the northwest, and Yunnan in the southwest. Construction should begin in the third five-year plan, so that Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi can be closely linked and the unparalleled potential of the three provinces can be brought into play. Although Zhanjiang Port is good, there are often typhoons, which sometimes hinder transportation. Beihai, Guangxi is also a good port and is very close to Nanning. It is hoped that a railway will be built in the not too distant future to connect the two places and open a central gate.

Opinions on the development of Guangxi Province

Guangxi has abundant materials, sufficient manpower, and a good transportation position, but it is still a province with backward production, and the phenomenon of "goods abandoned on the ground" is revealed everywhere, which is not allowed in our country's journey towards a socialist society. However, development is not something that can be achieved with a snap of the fingers. We must pay attention to the following points:

It is recommended that the central government organize forces to conduct a comprehensive survey in Guangxi

First, Guangxi has never had a good development from ancient times to the present. Before liberation, although the warlords had the slogan of "New Guangxi", the resources that were蕴藏着 had never been scientifically surveyed. After liberation, the geological and mineral resources have been closely investigated by the exploration teams sent by the central government, but because of the large area, it has not been fully covered. As for forests, animal husbandry, economic crops, etc., the provincial departments have indeed conducted surveys, but due to the lack of technical cadres, they cannot be done very well. For example, for wild oil plants, the provincial supply and marketing cooperative has excavated 17 kinds such as mountain cangzi and cocklebur, and sent them to the industrial department. The cadres of the department can only test their composition, and cannot determine their use. They still cannot keep up with the needs. There are even more that have not been excavated, and I don't know how many there are. It is said that a Soviet expert said to people after traveling in Guangxi: "The subtropical area of the Soviet Union is only 20 kilometers by the Black Sea, and it freezes between autumn and winter. We use it very economically. China has such a good place, the climate is so warm, the rainfall is so abundant, the area is so vast, the land is full of gold, you should work hard to seize the time!" This is such a sincere and correct suggestion! Therefore, I think our central government should organize a large number of scientific experts and technical talents to conduct a comprehensive survey in Guangxi, and the research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences should also set up more branches or workstations in Guangxi to specialize in research for a long time, so that the abundant materials can be liberated from the long-suppressed environment.

Develop economic crops according to local conditions

Second, Guangxi Province is a mountainous area. In the past, because of inconvenient transportation, grain must be self-sufficient. Therefore, grain must be the main production. Now that transportation is gradually becoming convenient, the adjacent provinces of Hunan and Yunnan are all places where grain is abundantly produced. As long as it can produce other things, even if it produces less grain, it is not impossible. The land in Guangxi is roughly divided into three categories: paddy fields, dry fields, and slash-and-burn land. If only paddy fields produce grain and dry fields and slash-and-burn land plant trees and economic crops, and grazing cattle and sheep on the mountains and raising fish and ducks in the ponds, the benefits will definitely be far above farming. Just looking at the farmers in the Jingxi County area who wear watches after planting Tianqi is a good example. In recent years, some rural cadres have been too strict in implementing crop plans, so that farmers cannot engage in sideline businesses, or have no time to take care of sideline businesses, resulting in phenomena such as indiscriminate felling of forests, slaughtering of piglets, and economic crops being separated from production; the staff of trade companies are single-mindedly trying to accumulate more funds for the country, ignoring the ethnic policies, resulting in more deviations in pressing down on prices in more remote ethnic minority areas, unintentionally hitting the farmers' enthusiasm for sideline businesses and economic crop production, and also aroused the adverse current of material depletion. This fact has now been vigorously corrected by the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee; but some ethnic minorities are limited by the environment and are not easy to express their experience and demands. In order to increase the production of various kinds of products that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, it is hoped that the central government will send personnel from the industrial and agricultural departments to carefully inspect, arrange with local cadres, and stipulate the appropriate areas for crops, economic crops, forests, animal husbandry, and aquaculture on a county-by-county and township-by-township basis. In some places, sideline businesses must be upgraded to main businesses, and grain production must be reduced to sideline businesses. In this way, it can supply raw materials for domestic light industry, and secondly, it can earn foreign exchange or exchange for raw materials for heavy industry, which is what Premier Zhou said "the comprehensive development of the agricultural economy". The tendency of singularization and one-sidedness must be corrected. As for the crop area, attention must still be paid to sideline businesses that are beneficial to farmers, so that their income can be guaranteed to increase and their living standards can be gradually improved.

Land and water transportation should be further improved

Third, Guangxi's waterways, the vertical ones are the Gui River and the Liu River, and the horizontal ones are the Zuo River, the You River, the Hongshui River, and the Nanpan River. The distribution is very uniform, and the potential for water transportation is very large. Wooden sailboats are too slow and cannot meet the needs of industrial and agricultural development; the operation of ships must maintain a certain water level, and Guangxi has a dry season, and there are many dangerous beaches in the river. The shipping bureau has limited funds, and it must be greatly invested by the central Ministry of Water Resources for renovation. Among them, the Hongshui River and the Nanpan River are deep-water waterways, with an average river width of about 150 meters and a total length of about 2,000 kilometers. Both sides are large-scale fir trees with great economic value. There are many large beaches and waterfalls in the river, which can also be used for power generation. Moreover, after this river is repaired, it will become the transportation trunk line of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces. The Beipan River basin is the light industrial area of Guizhou, and southern Yunnan is the most prosperous area. Guangxi is connected with these two provinces by waterways, and the cost of transporting goods by sea is the lowest, which has a significant effect. Rivers are natural wealth. Although it takes some financial resources to develop, the investment is small and the effect is large. Compared with railway investment, it only needs one-fortieth. It is a waste if such wealth is not used well. Therefore, I hope that the dredging of Guangxi's rivers should be included in the country's second five-year plan. When the upstream is developed and the population is evenly distributed, the Gaoyao Reservoir in Guangdong and the Dateng Gorge Reservoir in Guangxi can be built. Although many lands are turned into large lakes and the area of rivers is expanded, the people are not afraid of having no place to migrate. Furthermore, the existing highways have a large quantity and poor quality, and can be said to be unrated among the country's highways. The highway should be eight meters wide, but now it is only four and a half meters, so that it is easy to collide when two cars pass each other. Moreover, the folk transport mostly uses animal power. Every time a car passes by, cattle and horses jump and people run away, and they are forced to the cliffs and cannot dodge, which can easily cause accidents. It is said that the people have expressed to the government that, in order to meet local needs, they are willing to have the state requisition more land; however, the province is short of funds, and their wishes have still not been fulfilled. I believe that in the second five-year plan, the central government should allocate a part of the funds to change the highways in Guangxi Province from unrated to fifth-class. This will cost the central government limited funds (about 5,000 yuan per kilometer), and the people of Guangxi will benefit endlessly.

Develop cultural, educational, and health undertakings

Fourth, most of Guangxi is an ethnic minority area, and education has not yet been popularized; since the advanced agricultural cooperation, elementary schools have been established in every township, but the difference in quality cannot be denied. In order to implement the ethnic policy and enable all ethnic minorities to accept modern culture, it is indeed necessary to improve. I happened to be in Guangxi this time to attend the provincial ethnic and folk art performance. I watched it from beginning to end. Whether it was singing, dancing, music, or drama, it could show the artistic characteristics of the ethnic group. Especially the dance item showed more beautiful and rich postures, which broadened my horizons. Therefore, I think that after the implementation of the ethnic policy and the popularization of education, the culture of all ethnic groups in Guangxi will inevitably have a rapid improvement and more excellent creations. Since the promulgation of the Zhuang alphabet, the counties in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture have universally promoted it, and everyone can use it freely after studying for three months. Even old women in their fifties and sixties can pick up a pen and write letters, which shows how willingly they accept the new education and how they can exert the effectiveness of education in a short period of time. As for technical education and higher education, in order to develop the entire Guangxi and train more senior cadres, the central government must also pay special attention to it and add various vocational schools and comprehensive universities. Moreover, Guangxi is located in the subtropics, and the removal of mosquitoes, flies, and rats is more difficult than in the northern provinces. Malignant malaria, schistosomiasis, leprosy, dysentery, etc. are a great threat, and medical and health work needs to be greatly promoted and go deep into the countryside, so medical personnel must also be trained. However, there are many aspects to this kind of education, but there are few teachers and it is difficult to improve the equipment, and it may not be possible to advance in all aspects at once. I think that the Guangxi Education Department should discuss with the central higher education and industrial and agricultural, health, and other departments to formulate a method for the youth of the province to study abroad, select a number of people each year, and distribute them to colleges and universities above the central and provincial vocational colleges to study or go to various factories and mines to study. For example, those who study geology and mining come to Beijing, those who study heavy industry and forestry go to the Northeast, those who study light industry go to Shanghai, those who study animal husbandry go to Lanzhou, and those who study medicine and health go to Wuhan and Guangzhou. In this way, it is easier to absorb advanced experience, and it is also easier to combine with the needs of reality when they return to work in the province in the future.

In short, there are several key points in the development of Guangxi that should be specially recognized. The first point is that Guangxi has a lot of resources, and as long as it is properly handled, it will play a great role in supporting our country's industrialization. For example, the national paper production is not enough to meet the demand, and publishing work has to be tightened, but Guangxi has a large number of paper-making raw materials such as wood, bamboo, dragon beard grass, citronella, and sugarcane dregs. If several large-scale paper mills are not built there, wouldn't it be begging for food with a golden rice bowl? The second point is that Guangxi's construction does not cost much money and the benefits are obtained quickly. For example, a bumper harvest can be achieved in the second year after water conservancy is built, animal husbandry and forests are easy to grow, and a large amount of materials can be transported out as soon as the waterway is opened. The capital invested can be recovered in a short period of time. This calculation is worth making. The third point is that Guangxi has sufficient material resources and labor force, but it lacks financial resources and technical talents. The people of Guangxi cannot solve this problem by themselves. The province does it piece by piece, and it may be able to achieve some results over time, but it takes a lot of effort and less success, which is uneconomical; the central government must take overall planning into account and strongly support it in order to most economically bring out the potential there and transform it from the temporary phenomenon of "barren land and impoverished people" to the permanent state of "rich land and rich people." The "Suggestions on the Second Five-Year Plan" state, "In order to promote the development of economic and cultural undertakings in ethnic minority areas, it is necessary to strengthen the construction work in ethnic minority areas and gradually change the backward situation in ethnic minority areas." I wish that this plan will be completed in the ethnic minority areas of Guangxi in the near future. What I said above is only based on some very superficial feelings based on my personal short-term experience; without careful investigation and mature consideration, there must be many places that are very incorrect. I hope that the CPPCC members and Guangxi comrades will give me careful corrections! Finally, I would like to express my most sincere respect to the hardworking and thrifty people of Guangxi and their leaders! Let me add one more sentence: Guangxi is the base of Nong Zhigao's leadership of the peasant uprising and the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution. The people of Guangxi will inevitably be happy to accept this revolutionary traditional spirit and bring it into play in the socialist industrial and agricultural construction, adding a brilliant achievement to our motherland. I hope this day will come soon!

    向称地瘠民贫的广西大有发展前途
    顾颉刚谈视察广西观感
    我去年读了中国共产党第八次全国代表大会通过的“关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议”和周恩来总理的“关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议的报告”，这回又听到李富春副总理“关于第二个五年计划的若干问题的说明”，使我对于祖国建设的目标，由落后的农业国变为先进的社会主义工业国，认清了既积极又稳妥可靠的步骤。我很想在这个社会主义建设运动中发挥出我的一份微末的力量，所以就把亲见亲闻的实际情况结合了这个伟大的指示来说一说我的意见。
    我于去年5月视察东北，看到工、矿、农、林各种生产的突飞猛进达到了惊人的地步，深深体会着社会主义制度的优越性，对于党和毛主席的正确领导、苏联的无私援助和工人同志们的忘我劳动都得到了最真切的认识。我实在想不到在被敌人残酷毁灭的遗墟上，经过解放后短短的几年里就会有这般既弘壮又细致的工业成果。在极度的兴奋之下，惟有庆幸自己得为新中国的人民，庆幸自己在伟大的祖国建设事业里还得为某一部门的工作的一员。
    因为我已略略看到我国工农业的先进地区，有意选一个生产比较落后的地区来对照一下，所以去年11月就到广西去视察，为的是从古以来，广西永远被人们称为“地瘠民贫”的。一路上，我和朋友们讨论这贫瘠的原因，知道广西地方很多石山区，无数小山和石块在平地上矗起；就是弥望的平原，挖下几尺也就是石头，土太薄了，打井又不容易。住在石山区里的人们为了要饮料，往往到一二十里路外去担水，甚至发生半途抢水的事故；有的在石山上凿洞填土种庄稼，用了父子两代的劳力才开出两亩田，等于笑话里讲的“凿孔栽须”。而且广西因为山高水陡，土广人稀，水利和消灭病虫害的工作不易急速开展，所以旱灾、水灾、风灾、虫灾、兽灾百般侵袭，年年成灾，年年需要救济。在这般情形之下，哪能不称为“地瘠民贫”，它和东北的富裕繁荣恰成一个鲜明的对比。
    以上所说，在过去是事实，到现在还是事实。一般人对于广西的印象，只有“桂林山水甲天下，阳朔山水甲桂林”，好像广西除了在游山玩水上可以发生一点作用以外，再没有什么该注意的，也就是说对于新中国的建设事业没有什么大帮助的。可是我这回视察，在广西走了十几个县市，越走越觉得所谓“地瘠民贫”只是表面的现象、暂时的现象、没有尽人力用科学技术妥善安排的结果。它和东北差不多有同样的资源，而它的地位在西南，比了东北更具备有利的条件，它的发展前途是无穷大的。中国共产党有无比的毅力，广西人民又有忍苦耐劳的传统精神，如果中央的力量多用一点到广西，改造自然，发挥潜力，我敢断言，广西必然会变成第二个东北。现在试把我所见到的在这次会议里报告出来，请大家讨论。
    广西省有些什么？
    矿藏丰富，可以发展为重工业区
    广西境内诚然石山多，不适于农耕，可是石山的本身就是一种生产的原材料。现在我们全国基建不是很缺乏石灰、水泥吗，石山正可以供应这个需要。如果在那里建立若干处大规模的石灰、水泥厂，我敢说这些原材料一万年也用不完。至于土山，那里的矿产就太多了。锰是炼钢不可少的资料，我国的生产量在全世界占第一位，而广西省的生产量在全中国占第一位；钨，和锰有同样的效用，广西的产量也不少；只因本省未设钢铁厂，所以这些生产只有送往东北使用。铁，以前认为广西只有几十万吨，现在勘探结果知道不是这样，而且品质甚好，如办起钢铁厂来，资源的供应不成问题。铜、锡矿，云南最有名，广西西部毗连云南，当然也不在少数。铅锌的生产也富，柳州设有锌品厂，为了领导和工人们肯努力摸索，所出的芭蕉牌氧化锌粉的质量已达到了世界水平，畅销国外。此外如煤、石油、石膏、铝、锑、沙金、水银、水晶及各种稀有金属，随着勘探队的足迹而陆续发现，他们说：广西虽没有像东北的钢都和煤都，但是矿产的种类并不比东北少，建立重工业区的条件是具备的。
    林木生长迅速，将来是南方重要森林基地
    就说矿产不是广西的生产重点吧，试来看森林。广西是山区，柳州以南又是亚热带，木材年长率快，年砍伐量也就大。据估计，宜林地的面积约一亿二千余万市亩，木材量没有经过精密勘察，有人说是一亿八千万立方米。现在全省木材的年产量只有一百万立方米左右，然而单是红水河和南盘江沿岸就有四千五百万立方米，可轮伐三十年，每年生产可达一百五十万立方米；所苦的现在交通不便，伐了运不出来；有待于航道的大力开发。广西主要的树种是杉木、马尾松、云南松，造林后十五年至二十年即可砍伐，比较东北要快得多。所不同的，东北的森林是大片而广西则是一小片一小片地生着；但只要人工绿化，二十年内即可和东北一样，那时就可大量机械化采伐了。一面采伐，一面培植，旧的没有伐完，新的又已成材，真是无尽藏的利源。所以从发展观点来看，我们将来的全国森林工业应以南方各省为主要基地，而广西和云南两省所占的全国亚热带地区最广，尤应为南方的主要基地。
    经济植物极为繁富
    介于森林与园艺之间的是经济作物，这是广西的绝大利源，它的利益更大于森林，全国只有海南岛可以比拟。甘蔗，是制糖的原料，贵县、桂平等处已建厂大量制造，这是大家都知道的。橡胶种得很健壮，它的抗寒能力一年强似一年，前年一月大寒流中竟未受害，可见它适合种植。紫胶，一名木豆，韧性强大，可作粘合剂，放在橡胶里可使效力增长一倍，例如一个橡皮轮子该走一万公里的，融了紫胶进去就可走二万公里。八角，即茴香，可用作香料，也可蒸油，也可作炸药，这在全国只有广西西南部可种。到处繁植的桉树，它的干可作铁路枕木及建筑资料，其中柠檬桉叶可制柠檬油，供外科药用。櫶木，是质地最坚实的一种树，可作机器的架子。栓皮栎，在百色专区北部各县里漫山遍野地长着，它是工业用的软木，又是含有单宁，可为制革用的原料；现在无法利用，只有砍来当柴烧。剑麻，是硬质纤维植物，拉力最强，不怕碱性腐蚀，又有耐水作用，可做船缆、鱼网和矿山及森林工业里用的绳索。咖啡，桂南种的很多，质量高的抵得上美国最好的一种，一亩地可种一百二十株，丰产年每株可收二十市斤，每斤价一元四角，一亩产值三千余元，远在粮食价格之上。铁力木、阿克锡，都可作咖啡的荫树，种一年即高于人；阿克锡又是制革用的原料。海岛棉，施种的第一年即可有小收获，第二年就旺产，一株可收一斤半棉。药材，现有名目六百八十种，运往苏联、南洋和其他兄弟国家的有一百十四种，在全国常用中药三百九十五种里有一百六十六种。其中最贵重的是田七，为治内外伤的特效药，销行南洋等处，每百斤的价值高至一万二千元。其他杜仲、肉桂、茶辣、首乌、蛤蚧、甲片等都有丰富的产量。至于香料作物、麻类作物、饲料作物，一时数也数不清，真可以说“得天独厚”。广西荒山荒地还有一亿一千万市亩，而这些经济作物大多数只须干旱瘠薄的土壤，不占水田，如加以有计划的人工繁殖，对于国计民生实有极大的裨益。
    经济动物品类亦多
    为了荒山荒地的广大，随处有草料，畜牧业跟着发展，牛、马、驴、骡、羊都有生产，现在制革工业已有相当发达的基础。水塘多，可养鸭，我到隆林的一个苗族农业合作社，那里就养鸭至一万只，可见全省家禽数量的巨大，可是鸭毛还没有被利用。猪肉皮薄味鲜，向来销到外省外洋；现在中央和省方再三号召养猪，将来猪的数量和质量必有很大的提高。野生动物有虎、熊、麂、猴、野猪、蚺蛇、果子貍等。猴子本是兽灾之一，现因国外收购，农民诱引它们喝酒，醉后捕捉，成为一宗富源。就是渔业，前年把钦州专区划归广东后，广西更无海岸，大家以为不再有前途了，然而桂南天气暖和，鱼苗容易长大，一寸的苗经过一两年的时间就长到十余斤重，所以在那里养一年抵得上在江苏养两年。再有一个特点，同浙江和四川一样，稻田可以养鱼，每亩可收二百余斤。全省稻田约二千四百万亩，如果普遍利用，岂不是农民的最好副业！所以，广西的生产应当特别注重于经济植物和经济动物的发展上，它俩是广西经济有决定意义的生产部门，该受中央的支持和全国人民的注视。
    农作物一年四熟
    回头再来说农作物。固然好些地方土薄缺水，常逢灾荒，可是因为在亚热带里，全年雨量达一千五百至二千公厘，四季可以生产，两?、三?的地方多的是。桂南地区，水稻可种早、中、晚、冬四?，玉米也早、中、晚、秋四熟，此外尚有麦、豆、薯、瓜等作物，而灾害不是终年所有，失之于这一季的还可以补偿于别一季。从前有些地区田里不下肥料，播种又复稀疏，所以生产较少；自合作化后号召积肥，各处设置厕所，种法改为小株密植，把一尺宽的改为六寸，就有一倍以上的生产。加以中、小型水利大量建设，去年一年中全省完成了十六万处，受益面积达九百万亩。至于大型水利，如田阳的磺桑江水库一建，农民家给人足，当地的草屋已逐渐改为瓦房；邕宁的老虎岭水库一建，它灌溉所及的田亩，在去年的大旱灾里不但未受影响，还增产至一倍。所以广西的土地虽说相当瘠薄，但只要水利建设起来，灾荒问题就容易解决，又可利用它发电，终究应该乐观的。
    男女农民锻炼成了勤劳的性格
    再说广西人民的劳动力，这又是大可钦敬的一件事。别的地方有农忙也有农闲，像北方各省为了只种一季，一闲就是半年。广西四时可种，需要随时劳动，又是灾害特多，需要随时抵抗，那就把人民锻炼成为非常勤劳的性格。我在山区里走，看见妇女们除操作家务和社务以外，还背着超过她们体重的土石筐子走路，同时还利用了闲着的一双手劈青麻。在别的省分里，老年妇女必有裹足的，但是广西则农村不用说，就在城市也没见过一个七八十岁的裹足老妇，可见她们从来就有勤奋劳动的传统。妇女如此，男子可知。我们一路所见，苗、瑶诸族住在山头，费了极大的劳力取得很少的水，然而他们却把梯田和副业经营得好好的。自由市场开放后，农村里的人们不少到城市贩卖货物，他们为了节约，不住客店，常常坐在空地上过夜。从这些地方，都可以看出他们的生活是如何刻苦，如何修养成勤劳和节俭的美德。将来全省工业化后，他们必然会在工厂里表现突出的劳动和创造，涌现无数的劳动模范和先进工作者，在全国工人队伍里起示范的作用。
    百色地区可望成为我国西南角铁路网中心
    再说广西的交通。现有的航线有季节性，不能终年畅通；又多险滩，不能全线畅通。公路限于经费，不够标准，在山区里晴通雨阻。这些现象当然都须改进。铁路则有北通湖南、南通越南的湘桂线，有西北通贵州的黔桂线，有西南通雷州半岛的黎湛线。湛江港是一个深水不冻港，对于从欧洲和东南亚到中国大陆来的轮船，它是一个航线最短的港口。所以湘桂、黎湛两线都是中国的南门，也就是广西的东西两座大门，对于本省的工农业发展有极大的关系。然而仅有这三条铁路已足够开发广西了吗？我觉得远不够。因为要建设中国的西南角，从地形和生产上看，应该合滇、黔、桂三省为一体。广西的百色是一重要地区，它居于桂西僮族自治州的中心，这个区域是物产最丰富、开发最紧要的；它又西北通贵州兴义达云南昆明，西南通云南博爱（剥隘），为滇、黔两省货物所集中。所以它现在是物资转运的中心，将来必成为广西的最大工业区，也就是中国西南角铁路网的适当中心。我以为在第二个五年计划里，应该设计和测量以百色为中心的辐射线，使它东南通南宁，东北通河池，西北通贵州，西南通云南，在第三个五年计划里开始建筑，这样，就可以把滇、黔、桂紧紧地联系，发挥出三省的无比潜力。又湛江港虽好而常有台风，有时妨碍运输，广东北海也是一个好港口，又离南宁甚近，希望在不太远的将来建筑一条铁路，把两地衔接起来，开出一座居中的大门。
    对开发广西省的意见
    广西的物资既丰富，人力又足用，交通地位又占得好，可是现在还是一个生产落后的省份，还处处呈露出“货弃于地”的现象，这是我国走向社会主义社会的程途中所不许可的。然而开发不是一件可以弹指立现的事情，我们必须注意以下几点：
    建议中央组织力量在广西作全面调查
    其一，广西从古至今不曾有过好好的开发。解放前军阀们虽曾有“新广西”的号召，但蕴藏着的物资始终没有经过科学性的调查。解放后，地质、矿产已由中央派去的勘探队作详密调查，但因面积广大，还未周遍。至于森林、畜牧、经济作物等项，省方各厅局固然已作了调查，但因技术干部的缺乏，不能做得很完善。例如野生油类植物，省供销社曾经发掘了山苍子、苍耳子等十七种，送交工业厅，厅干部只能化验它的成分，不能判定它的用途，依然赶不上需要。没有被发掘的，更不知有多少。听说苏联某专家游历广西后对人说：“苏联亚热带地方只有黑海边二十公里，秋冬间还要结冰，我们十分经济地利用着。中国有这等好的地方，气候如此温暖，雨量如此充沛，区域如此广大，满地是黄金，你们应当努力争取时间才是呀！”这是多么诚恳而正确的建议！因此，我想我们中央应当组织大量的科学专家和技术人才到广西去作全面调查，中国科学院各研究所也应在广西多设分所或工作站，长期专力研究，方可使得丰富的物资从久被压抑的环境里解放出来。
    因地制宜发展经济作物
    其二，广西省是山区，从前因为交通不便，粮食必须自给自足，所以非把粮食为主要的生产不可。现在交通逐渐便利，毗邻湖南、云南诸省都是丰产粮食的地方，本省内凡是不适宜于农耕的土地，只要它能生产别的东西，就是少产些粮食亦无不可。广西田地大体上分为水田、旱田、畬地三类，如果只把水田产粮而把旱田和畬地种树木和经济作物，以及山上放牧牛羊、塘里生养鱼鸭，所得的利益必然远在农耕之上。只要看靖西县一带的农民种了田七就戴上手表，可算是一个好例。近年有些农村干部对于农作物计划执行过严，以致农民不能兼营副业，或无暇顾及副业，遂有滥砍森林、宰杀小猪及经济作物脱产等现象；贸易公司工作人员一心要替国家多积资金，忽略了民族政策，以致越是偏僻的少数民族地区越多压级压价的偏差，无意中打击了农民对副业和经济作物生产的积极性，也就激起了物资枯涸的逆流。这种事实，现已由党省委由省人委大力纠正；但少数民族受环境的限制，不易把自己的经验和要求表达出来，也是有的。为了增加多种多样有利于国计民生的生产，希望中央派工农业部门人员悉心视察，会同当地干部，一县一乡地安排，规定出农作物、经济作物、森林、畜牧、水产养殖业等适当的地区；有的地方直须把副业升为正业，而把粮食生产降为副业。这一来可以供应国内轻工业原料，二来可以争取外汇或换取重工业原料，就是周总理所说的“农业经济的全面发展”，单一化和片面化的倾向是必该纠正的。至于农作物区中，仍须注意有利于农民的副业，使得他们的收入可以保证增加，他们的生活水平可以逐渐提高。
    水陆交通要进一步改善
    其三，广西水道，纵的是桂江、柳江，横的是左江、右江、红水河和南盘江，排布甚为匀称，水运的潜力甚大。木帆船太慢，不能供应工农业的发展的需要；行驶轮船则必须保持一定的水位，而广西有枯水期，江中又多险滩，航运局经费有限，非由中央水利部大大投资修治不可。其中红水河和南盘江是深水航道，江面平均宽约一百五十公尺，全长约二千公里，两岸都是大规模的杉木，经济价值特大。江中大滩、大瀑布甚多，又可利用发电。而且这条江修好之后，即成为滇、黔、桂三省的交通干线，北盘江流域是贵州的轻工业区，云南南部又是最富庶的地区，广西由水道和这两省联系，货物航运费用最低，那就发生了重大的作用。河流本是天然的财富，虽然需要投一部分财力来开辟，究竟投资少而收效大，和铁路投资相较只须四十分之一，这种财富若不善为利用岂非等于浪费。所以我希望广西河道的疏通应当列入全国第二个五年计划之中。等到上游开发，人口分布均匀，那时广东高要水库和广西大藤峡水库就可建设起来，虽是许多陆地变作大湖，河流扩大面积，人民也就不怕没有迁徙的地方了。再说现有公路，量多质薄，在全国公路里可以说是不列等的。公路应宽八公尺，现在只有四公尺半，以致两车交驰容易碰撞，又民间运输多用兽力，每一汽车经过时，牛马腾跃，人民奔避，而又逼于崖壁，没法躲闪，非常容易发生事故。听说人民曾向政府表示，为了适合当地需要，自愿把土地给国家多征用些；然而省方绌于财力，依然未能达成他们的愿望。我以为在第二个五年计划里，中央应当拨出一部分经费，把广西全省公路从不列等改为第五等。这在中央所费有限（每公里约须补助五千元）而广西人民就受惠无穷了。
    发展文教卫生事业
    其四，广西大部分是少数民族地区，教育尚未普及；自农业高级合作化后，已达到乡乡有小学，然质量之差无可讳言。为了实现民族政策，使少数民族都能接受现代文化，确有提高的必要。我这回到广西，恰逢全省民族民间文艺会演，从头到尾看了一下，无论歌、舞、音乐、戏剧都能表现出本民族的艺术特点，尤其舞蹈一项更表现了优美和丰富的姿态，大开我的眼界，所以我觉得在民族政策实现、教育普及之后，广西各民族的文化必然会有急剧的提高和更优秀的创造。自从公布了僮文字母之后，桂西僮族自治州各县普遍推行，大家学了三个月就能自由运用；连五六十岁的老妇女也能提笔写信，这可见他们如何甘心乐意地接受新教育，他们如何能在短期内发挥教育的效能。至于技术教育、高等教育，为
  了开发整个广西和培养较多的高级干部
  计，中央也必须特予注意，增设各专科学校及综合性大学。又广西地处亚热带，蚊、蝇、鼠的清除比北方诸省困难，恶性疟疾、血吸虫病、麻疯、痢疾等威胁甚大，医药卫生工作急需大力推动，且深入
  农村，所以医务人员也须多多培养。可是这种教育，方面甚多而师资甚少，设备又难完善，一时未必能齐头并进。我觉得广西教育厅应当和中央高教及工农业、卫生等部门商定一个本省青年出外就学的办法，每年考选若干人，分发到中央及各省专科以上学校肄业或到各厂矿去学习，例如学地质和矿业的到北京来，学重工业和林业的到东北去，学轻工业的到上海去，学畜牧的到兰州去，学医药卫生的到武汉和广州去，这样就容易吸收先进经验，将来回到本省工作时也容易结合现实的需要了。
    总而言之，开发广西有几个要点应当特别认识。第一点，广西有很多的资源，只要善为处置，对于我们国家工业化的支援会起极大的作用。例如现在全国纸张生产不够需用，出版工作只得紧缩，可是广西有木材、竹子、龙须草、香茅、甘蔗渣等大批造纸原料，如果不在那里建设几个大规模的纸厂，岂非抱了金饭碗讨饭？第二点，广西建设，花钱不多而获得利益甚速，如兴修水利后第二年即可丰收，畜牧、森林容易成长，航路一通即可运出大量物资，所投的资本都能指日收还。这个算盘是值得打的。第三点，广西有充足的物力和劳动力，只是缺乏财力和技术人才。这个问题，广西人民自己不能解决，省方枝枝节节地做，固然积久也可有些成绩，但费力多而成功少，不经济；必须中央统筹兼顾，大力支持，方可最经济地发挥出那里的潜力，使它从“地瘠民贫”的暂时现象转化为“地厚民富”的永久境界。“第二个五年计划的建议”里说，“为了促进各少数民族地区的经济事业和文化事业的发展，必须加强少数民族地区的建设工作，逐步地改变少数民族地区的落后状况”，我祝颂在不久的将来就会在广西各民族地区里完成这个计划。以上所说，只凭我个人短期间的见闻说出一些极粗浅的感想；没有经过详密的调查，成熟的考虑，必然有许多地方是很不正确的。希望政协同人和广西同志给我仔细的指正！最后，我谨向勤劳俭朴的广西人民及其领导者致最诚挚的敬意！再补说一句：广西是侬智高领导农民起义和太平天国革命的策源地，广西人民必然乐于接受了这个革命的传统精神发挥到社会主义的工农业的建设里，为我们的祖国增加光芒万丈的成就，我希望这一天快快地到来！
