Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 20th - The trend of agricultural cooperative cadres going to the fields to participate in production is a new phenomenon in Jiangsu Province's spring plowing this year.

　　After last year's high tide of agricultural cooperativization, a considerable number of cadres in agricultural cooperatives across Jiangsu left production to take on various leadership roles within the cooperative. The vast majority of these cadres had relatively rich production experience, but due to busy work schedules and excessive meetings, they were unable to work in the fields. Some of them gradually became alienated from the members, and their guidance of production developed problems of subjectivism and bureaucratism. In addition, the cadre compensation system in some areas was not entirely reasonable, and some cadres developed a fondness for ease and aversion to work, becoming detached from the masses.

　　At the end of last year, while summarizing the experiences and lessons learned from last year's production and cooperative management, local Party committees commended a group of cooperative cadres who both participated in production and did a good job in their work, and mobilized cadres to participate in production. Many places also changed the method of "separation from production, fixed subsidies" for cooperative cadres to "fixed work production, fixed quota subsidies, more work, more pay"; at the same time, they reduced the number of cooperative meetings and established a system of rotating on-duty and regular meetings for cooperative cadres, creating conditions for cooperative cadres to work in the fields.

　　Now that spring plowing has begun in various parts of Jiangsu, many agricultural cooperative cadres who were formerly detached from production are now participating in the production teams and working in the fields. After these cadres went to the fields, they gained a more concrete understanding of the changing situation in production activities, and as a result, their leadership of production became more specific and their problem-solving became more timely. For example, the labor quota for work types in Shuangmiao Cooperative, Gaoyou County, was unreasonable, and the members were unhappy about participating in agricultural production and were willing to engage in sideline occupations. After the cooperative and team cadres learned about this situation in production, they immediately conducted a detailed study and made reasonable revisions to the spring work quota. Some households in Sifen Cooperative, Chengdong Township, Jurong County, had difficult lives and were not enthusiastic about production. After the cooperative cadres learned about this, they immediately took out 35 yuan and 2,000 kilograms of rice from the public accumulation to advance to them. After the agricultural cooperative cadres participated in production, the relationship between cadres and the masses was also greatly improved. In Yancheng County, more than 6,500 cooperative and team cadres took the lead in participating in production, and the attendance rate of members increased from the original 50% to more than 90%.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 21st - In Anhui Province, agricultural cooperative cadres' participation in production has become a new trend, which has not only solved many problems in the leadership of production by cooperative cadres, but also strengthened the relationship between cadres and members.

　　Agricultural cooperative cadres in Anhui Province found it difficult to discover and solve problems in production because they rarely participated in production. Since a large number of cadres participated in production, this situation has changed significantly. The fourteen cadres of Matang Agricultural Cooperative in Wuhu County went deep into the fields during the day, learning about the situation while producing, and visited the homes of members in the evening. In more than a month, they worked for more than thirty labor days and visited more than 120 member households, solving more than thirty major and minor problems in production and other aspects in a timely manner. Yuan Changgeng, the deputy director of Shengli Agricultural Cooperative in Dongliu County, took up his hoe again and worked with the members after he was assigned to the production team to lead production. In production, he used his rest time to help the members evaluate their work well and assign the farm work for the next day. In this way, the members who had been working hard all day no longer had to hold meetings to evaluate work and assign tasks in the evening. Young members had time to go to people's schools, and women members also had time to do needlework. The cadres of Langya Agricultural Cooperative in Chuxian County also contracted several acres of land specifically for various yield increase experiments in order to better lead the agricultural technology reform of the entire cooperative.

　　The participation of cooperative cadres in production has encouraged the labor enthusiasm of the members. In the sand dike construction of Shadun Agricultural Cooperative in Wuhu County, the members were not enthusiastic. Seven cadres, including the director of the cooperative, took the lead in carrying soil to build the dike. As a result, the number of members participating in dike construction increased from 500 to more than 700, and a labor competition was launched, which greatly improved work efficiency.

　　The participation of cooperative cadres in production has also reduced the expenses of agricultural cooperatives. After the twenty-one cadres of Democratic Agricultural Cooperative in Tongcheng County participated in production, it is estimated that more than 1,900 labor days of work point subsidies can be reduced throughout the year.

### 江苏安徽农业社干部的新作风　深入田间参加生产领导生产

　　江苏安徽农业社干部的新作风
　　深入田间参加生产领导生产
    新华社南京20日电　农业社干部纷纷下田参加生产是今年春耕中江苏省的新气象。
    去年农业合作化高潮后，江苏各地农业社都有相当数量的干部脱离生产，担任社内各方面的领导工作。这些脱产干部绝大多数具有相当丰富的生产经验，但因工作繁忙，会议过多，不能下田劳动，其中有些人逐渐与社员疏远，指导生产也发生了主观主义和官僚主义的毛病。加上有些地方的干部报酬制度不尽合理，有些干部产生了好逸恶劳的毛病，脱离了群众。
    去年年底，各地党委在总结去年生产、办社经验教训的同时，表扬了一批既参加生产又搞好工作的社干部，动员干部参加生产。不少地方还把对社干部“脱离生产，固定补贴”的办法改成了“定工生产，定额补贴，多劳多得”的办法；同时，减少了社的会议，建立了社干部轮流值日、定期碰头的制度，为社干部下田劳动创造了条件。
    现在江苏各地春耕已经开始了，许多农业社过去的脱产干部，现在都参加了生产队下田劳动了。这些干部下田后，对生产活动的变化情况了解得具体了，因而他们领导生产也更加具体，解决问题更加及时了。例如：高邮县双庙社工种定额不合理，社员不高兴参加农业生产，愿意出去搞副业，社、队干部在生产中了解到这一情况后，立即作了详细研究，把春季的工种定额作了合理修订。句容县城东乡四分社有些困难户生活困难，生产情绪不高，社干部了解后，立即从公共积累中拿出三十五元和二千斤稻子预支给他们。农业社干部参加生产后，也大大改善了干部和群众的关系。盐城县六千五百多个社、队干部，带头参加生产，社员的出勤率从原来的50％提高到90％以上。
    新华社合肥21日电　安徽省农业社干部参加生产已经形成一种新的风气，这样，不仅解决了社干部领导生产上的许多问题，而且还密切了干部和社员的关系。
    安徽省农业社干部由于很少参加生产，因此很难发现和解决生产中的问题，自从大批干部参加生产以后，这种情况有了显著的改变。芜湖县马塘农业社十四个干部白天深入田间，一面生产，一面了解情况，晚上又到社员家里去访问，一个多月内，他们就做了三十多个劳动日，又访问了一百二十多户社员，及时解决了生产等方面的三十多个大小问题。东流县胜利农业社副主任袁长庚，他分工到生产队去领导生产以后，又重新拿起了锄头和社员一道干活了。在生产中，他利用休息时间帮助社员评好工，派好第二天的农活。这样，劳累了一天的社员晚上就不再开会评工和派活了，青年社员有时间上民校了，妇女社员也有时间做针线活了。滁县琅琊农业社的干部还专门包了几亩地作各种增产试验，以便更好地来领导全社的农业技术改革。
    社干部参加生产，鼓舞了社员的劳动热情。芜湖县沙墩农业社在修堤中，社员情绪不高，社主任等七个干部，就带头挑土修堤，结果参加修堤的社员由五百人增加到七百多人，并开展了劳动竞赛，工作效率提高了很多。
    社干部参加生产，也减少了农业社的开支。桐城县民主农业社二十一个干部参加生产以后，预计全年可以减少工分补贴一千九百多个劳动日。
