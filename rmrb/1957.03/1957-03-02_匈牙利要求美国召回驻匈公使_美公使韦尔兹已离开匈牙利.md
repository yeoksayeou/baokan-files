    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, February 28th: According to TASS, the Press Department of the Hungarian People's Republic Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the U.S. Embassy in Hungary on February 22nd, requesting the U.S. government to recall the U.S. Envoy to Hungary.

    The note pointed out that U.S. Envoy Whelton had been in Budapest for nearly four months since his arrival in early November last year. Not only had he not presented his credentials, but he had also failed to pay a formal visit to the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had every reason to believe that Whelton was deliberately delaying the presentation of his credentials. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs learned that Whelton had already begun to engage in official activities that, according to international law, could only be carried out by diplomatic envoys who had already presented their credentials.

    In light of the above circumstances, the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had no choice but to conclude that Whelton's actions were incompatible with international practice. Therefore, the Hungarian government requested the U.S. government to recall Whelton from Hungary if he was unwilling to present his credentials.

    According to a note from the U.S. Embassy in Budapest on February 27th, Whelton had already left Hungary.

    匈牙利要求美国召回驻匈公使
    美公使韦尔兹已离开匈牙利
    新华社1日讯  据塔斯社布达佩斯2月28日讯：匈牙利人民共和国外交部新闻司说，匈牙利外交部2月22日曾经交给美国驻匈牙利公使馆一个照会，要求美国政府召回美国驻匈牙利公使。
    这个照会指出，美国公使韦尔兹从去年11月初到达布达佩斯以来，已经快四个月了，他不仅不递交国书，而且也不到匈牙利外交部作正式拜会。匈牙利外交部完全有理由认为，韦尔兹是在有意识地拖延递交国书。同时，外交部获悉，韦尔兹已经开始进行按照国际法来讲只有已经递交国书的外交使节才能进行的官方活动。
    根据以上情况，匈牙利外交部不得不认为，韦尔兹的行动是同国际惯例不相容的，因此匈牙利政府要求美国政府从匈牙利召回韦尔兹，如果他不愿意递交国书的话。
    据美国驻布达佩斯公使馆2月27日的照会通知说，韦尔兹已经离开匈牙利。
