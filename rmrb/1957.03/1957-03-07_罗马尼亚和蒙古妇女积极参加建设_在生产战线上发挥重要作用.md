Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, March 5th: Women play an important role in Romania's socialist construction.

In the past five years, more than 300,000 women across the country have joined industrial and agricultural production. Many women have played a role in promoting production. On the industrial front, nearly 44,000 female advanced workers and 700 female innovators have emerged. In the food and light industries, where female workers constitute the majority, there are 58 female factory directors. Women already account for 46% of the total employees in socialist trade organizations.

In rural areas, women have actively participated in the socialist transformation of agriculture. There are more than 1,800 women in the leading bodies of collective farms, many of whom are chairpersons of collective farms. Many women also serve as work team leaders, agronomists, and other positions in state farms.

Women also occupy important positions in science, art, and literature. More than 600 female scientists work in the Romanian Academy of Sciences alone. In addition, dozens of women serve as university professors and lecturers. Among the 61,700 college students, 22,600 are female.

Women also successfully participate in national political activities alongside men. Among the representatives to people's congresses at all levels, 35,000 are women. In the February National Assembly elections this year, 71 women were elected as members of the National Assembly.

The Party and the government are very concerned about the welfare of women and children. In the countryside alone, more than 1,450 obstetrical hospitals and midwifery stations have been established. More than 1,000 nurseries and kindergartens have been established in enterprises and institutions. More than 50,000 mothers with many children have been awarded the title of "Heroine Mother" and the Order of Maternal Glory or the Medal of Maternal Virtue.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, March 5th: Mongolian women working in factories and enterprises already account for 40% of the total workers. Due to the construction and expansion of a number of factories and the opening of railways last year, the number of female workers has increased by 10% compared to 1955.

Mongolian women have always been an important labor force on the agricultural and pastoral production front. With the development of state-owned farms and production cooperatives, the number of female workers has also increased. There are now more than 2,500 people working in farms.

Mongolian working women have achieved excellent results in production, and various advanced figures have emerged. 70% of the workers in the felt workshop of the Industrial United Factory are women, and they completed the production tasks stipulated in the second five-year plan ahead of schedule last year. Female shoemaker Zhen Bule received the Choibalsan Prize for saving materials in the production of leather shoes. Milkmaid Hong Baode and vegetable worker Daolageer have achieved outstanding results in milking and increasing vegetable production.

Lam, Secretary-General of the Mongolian Federation of Working Women, told reporters that Mongolian women universally participate in political activities. Currently, the 66 female representatives in the Great People's Hural account for 22.4% of the total representatives. There are also more than 5,500 female representatives in the local Labor People's Congresses.

Lam said that illiteracy among Mongolian women has been basically eliminated, and female students in institutions of higher learning account for 30% of the student population. Women's federations also regularly organize women to study current affairs, politics, and conduct production internships, and teach them how to manage household affairs.
