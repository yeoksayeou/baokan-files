Ten years ago, on March 12, 1947, the then-President of the United States, Truman, submitted a message to the United States Congress. In this message, Truman requested Congress to allocate $400 million before June 30, 1948, to aid the governments of Greece and Turkey, and to send American civil and military officials to these two countries. He demanded that the US government take the above measures to help the Greek and Turkish reactionary governments "resist" the people fighting for independence and freedom. He also said that the US government intended to carry out this kind of "assistance" anywhere in the world to prevent the "threat of communism." The post-war American foreign policy proposed by Truman, which supports reactionary rule around the world through aid, suppresses popular movements, and expands American power to prepare for a new anti-Soviet war of aggression, is the policy known as the Truman Doctrine.

The choice of Greece and Turkey as the initial pilot projects of the Truman Doctrine was not accidental. After World War II, a coalition government including the National Liberation Front was established in Greece. Later, due to British armed intervention, the National Liberation Front was squeezed out, and King George II was restored. As a result, the Greek people were forced to take up arms again and launch a struggle against foreign armed intervention and military offensive of the reactionaries. Britain sent 8,000 troops and spent more than $300 million, but failed to stop the development of the Greek people's liberation movement. In March 1947, British troops began a partial withdrawal, and the reactionary rule in Greece was in imminent danger. How to maintain this anti-Soviet bridgehead in the Balkans, where the people generally embarked on the road of national liberation, and this strategically important area on the northern flank of the imperialist "lifeline" of the Mediterranean, was an extremely urgent problem for international imperialist reactionary forces. For the same strategic considerations, Turkey was also considered an indispensable and important base. It borders the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries in the region, and controls the passage of these countries into the Mediterranean. Its reactionary ruling clique has a feudal militaristic tradition. All these made the US imperialism, which became the world's reactionary bastion after the war and was determined to dominate the world, deeply interested. From Greece and Turkey, it could spy on the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries to the north, control the passage of the Mediterranean to the south, and plunder the rich resources of the vast Middle East and North Africa, replacing the positions of Britain and France. This was the strategic consideration behind Truman's aid plan for Greece and Turkey.

With the support of the new US intervention troops, coupled with the large amount of military supplies and loans given by the United States, the reactionary forces finally suppressed the Greek people's armed movement for national liberation. The unpopular reactionary rule in Turkey was also strengthened. However, the Truman Doctrine brought disaster to the people of Greece and Turkey and seriously damaged the national interests of the two countries.

As soon as the Americans stepped into Greece, the Communist Party was declared an illegal organization, and the reign of terror intensified. Under the rule of the Greek royalist fascists, which Truman called a "democratic" regime, the democratic forces of the Greek people were severely devastated, with more than 50,000 people arrested and 3,000 people sentenced to prison. Since accepting the Truman Doctrine in 1947, Turkey has openly embarked on the road of fascism, established a new police and gendarmerie headquarters and prison courts, and sentenced all progressive groups and leaders to death and life imprisonment.

The conditions of the Truman Doctrine's aid placed Greece and Turkey in a position subordinate to the United States. The United States controlled Turkey's finance, military, internal affairs, foreign policy, and the entire national structure. In Turkey, there were 5,000 American "advisers," "experts," "technicians," etc., entrenched in various departments, enjoying privileges, and manipulating Turkey's internal affairs and foreign policy. The US delegation stationed in Greece was actually the emperor emeritus of Greece. They openly instructed the Greek cabinet on how to organize itself. They determined Greece's economic policy and established a system in which everything was supervised by Americans. According to the agreement signed between the United States and Greece, the United States could send troops to station in Greece, and its equipment and materials could freely enter and leave Greece duty-free, freely deploy, and freely infringe upon Greece's territorial waters and airspace.

After receiving US aid, the economic lifelines of Greece and Turkey gradually fell into the hands of US monopoly capital. Foreign oil companies, led by Mobil Oil and Texaco, monopolized Turkey's oil. General Electric of the United States controlled Turkey's electrical equipment industry. Chase Bank of the United States controlled Turkey's finances. Similarly, International Telephone and Telegraph of the United States took over the entire Greek communication system. American tobacco companies monopolized the processing and export of Greek tobacco leaves. American Trans World Airlines monopolized Greek routes.

The military burden of Greece and Turkey has been increasing since the announcement of the Truman Doctrine. The huge military expenditure affects the national budgets, credit systems, foreign trade, and industrial development of the two countries. Turkey's annual military budget accounts for half of the total budget. Huge military expenditures have caused serious inflation. Greece's financial situation is also deteriorating. Its annual military budget accounts for more than 50% of the entire national budget. The heavy military burden and inflation have damaged the national economies of the two countries, and the living standards of the working people have dropped sharply. There are more than two million unemployed people in Turkey; in Greece, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed is no less than two million. The cost of living for Turkish workers has increased more than three times compared with before the war, but wages have not increased much. According to the 1955 report of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, domestic consumption in Greece has not yet reached the pre-war level.

The United States has also turned Greece and Turkey into markets for American goods and suppliers of cheap raw materials for the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. After the war, the proportion of trade between Greece and Turkey and the United States increased significantly, while the proportion of Britain in these two countries decreased significantly.

When the Truman Doctrine was announced, US officials and the press boasted that the Truman Doctrine had opened up a new, epoch-making road for US diplomacy. After the announcement of the Truman Doctrine, US monopoly capital successively adopted many measures to gradually realize its policy of dominating the world. In the summer of 1947, US Secretary of State Marshall gave a speech at Harvard University, suggesting economic "aid" to European countries in order to eliminate the evils of World War II. This was the beginning of the so-called Marshall Plan. In April 1948, the US Congress passed the "Foreign Aid Act" based on this plan. According to this act, countries receiving US aid should import US goods under preferential conditions and accept US supervision of the use of aid. This was actually a plan to deprive European countries of economic and political independence under the guise of reviving Europe. Before its expiration, this plan was actually replaced by another mainly military plan, the so-called "Mutual Security Act." In April 1949, the United States and Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and other eleven countries signed the North Atlantic Treaty in Washington, forming a military bloc. The United States also concluded some other military group treaties and many bilateral military agreements as supplements to these group treaties.

Under the guidance of the Truman Doctrine, US foreign policy has become increasingly militaristic. Military groups, military bases, and military assistance have become the main content of the US post-war Cold War and expansion policy that began with the Truman Doctrine. In the past ten years, the United States has established hundreds of military bases throughout the capitalist world, dragged dozens of countries into military groups or bilateral military arrangements, and supported many reactionary regimes rejected by the people with weapons and ammunition assistance. In doing so, US imperialism seeks to curb the expansion of socialist influence and suppress the burgeoning post-war people's movement in the capitalist world; at the same time, while calling on other countries to carry out an anti-Soviet and anti-communist crusade, it actually gains control over the capitalist world, extends its influence to other countries, and makes these countries one by one its vassals.

Over the past decade, under the cover of the tense situation of the Cold War, the United States has indeed achieved many fruits in establishing its hegemony in the capitalist world, encroaching on the rights and interests of other capitalist countries, especially in seizing the vested colonial interests of British and French imperialism. The US ruling group is now boasting about the victory of US post-war diplomacy, and its actual significance lies here. However, in terms of anti-Soviet and anti-communist, US imperialism has suffered a decisive setback.

In the early years after World War II, US imperialism was superstitious about its own strength and the atomic bomb, and believed that the Soviet Union had been greatly weakened in the anti-fascist war and could not withstand another war with the United States. It mistakenly believed that with its unique atomic bomb and inflated money bag, it could make the world accept the will of Wall Street. So for a time it was very arrogant, carrying out interference and expansion everywhere. But soon, the facts shattered the American imperialist's dream. Although American intervention achieved local success in some areas, it failed completely and irrevocably in one of the main battlefields, in China. Then the monopoly of the atomic bomb was declared bankrupt. The Korean War demonstrated in the most convincing facts that the American magician's skills were nothing more than that. This ended the era of American rampage after the war and caused a "painful reassessment" of Washington's foreign policy. Truman stepped down because of the "doctrine" he advocated and implemented. Truman's stepping down marked the failure of the US post-war foreign policy named after him.

The succeeding Eisenhower government basically followed the line of the Truman period in its foreign policy, but there were some differences in the areas, aspects, methods and implementation strategies that were emphasized. Over the years, it has suffered many failures and setbacks. Forced to cease fire in Korea. The Indochina military intervention plan failed. The European Army plan was rejected. The "liberation" policy had to change its tone. The "release Chiang Kai-shek from the cage" policy was forced to be revised. The situation is easing. The propaganda of "war edge" has aroused strong protests. Anti-American sentiment is rising universally. Conflicts between imperialists are becoming apparent. Centrifugal tendencies within various military blocs are developing. Recently, American imperialists have finally had to admit that coexistence with socialist countries is an inevitable reality, and that launching a war against the socialist camp cannot achieve victory. This is also an acknowledgment that the policy goals declared by the "Truman Doctrine" proposed ten years ago have not been achieved and cannot be achieved.

After the Egyptian war, American imperialists felt it necessary to put forward a "new" doctrine to replace the already discredited Truman Doctrine. As a result, the so-called Eisenhower Doctrine came into being. The Eisenhower Doctrine and the Truman Doctrine are actually in the same vein, but they are more cunning, more hypocritical, and more aimed at the vested colonial interests of Britain and France in the Middle East and Africa and the national interests of the countries in this region.

Replacing the Truman Doctrine with the Eisenhower Doctrine does not indicate a fundamental change in America's aggressive and expansionist foreign policy, but it does definitively indicate the complete bankruptcy of the Truman Doctrine.

A significant event is that on February 17, US State Department spokesman White declared that Mr. Truman could not accept the invitation to visit Greece and Turkey on the tenth anniversary of the announcement of the Truman Doctrine because he had another appointment. It seems that Mr. Truman is unbearable to recall the past.

    杜鲁门不堪回首
    梅逸
    十年前的1947年3月12日，当时的美国总统杜鲁门向美国国会提出了一项咨文，在这个咨文中，杜鲁门要求国会在1948年6月30日以前拨款四亿美元，援助希腊和土耳其的政府，并派遣美国的文武官员前往这两个国家。他要求美国政府采取上述措施，帮助希、土反动政府“抵抗”为独立和自由而战斗的人民。他还说，不论在世界上任何地方，美国政府都打算进行这种 “协助”，来防止“共产主义的威胁”。杜鲁门提出的这一个通过援助来支持世界各地的反动统治，压制人民运动，同时扩张美国的势力，准备新的反苏侵略战争的战后美国外交方针，即是以杜鲁门主义而闻名的方针。
    杜鲁门主义选择希腊、土耳其为其最初的试点，不是偶然的。第二次大战以后，希腊成立了包括民族解放阵线的联合政府。后因英国的武装干涉，民族解放阵线被排挤，国王乔治二世复辟。于是，希腊人民被迫重新拿起武器，展开反对外国武装干涉和反动派的军事进攻的斗争。英国派遣了八千英军，耗费了三亿多美元，却无法阻止希腊人民解放运动的发展。1947年3月英军开始局部撤退，希腊的反动统治危在旦夕。如何在人民普遍走上民族解放道路的巴尔干保持这块反苏桥头堡和地中海帝国主义“生命线”北翼的这片战略要冲地区，是国际帝国主义反动势力极为迫切的问题。由于同样的战略上考虑，土耳其也被认为是不可或失的重要基地。它在地区上同苏联和人民民主国家接壤，扼这些国家入地中海的通道。它的反动统治集团具有封建军国主义传统。这些都使在战后成为世界反动堡垒并一心要称霸全球的美帝国主义深感兴趣。从希腊和土耳其，向北可以窥视苏联和人民民主国家，向南可以握地中海的孔道，并掠取中东北非广大地区的丰富资源，取英法地位而代之，这就是杜鲁门援助希、土计划背后的战略考虑。
    靠着美国的新干涉部队的支持，加上美国给予的大量军火和贷款，反动势力终于把希腊人民争取民族解放的武装运动镇压下去了。土耳其的不得民心的反动统治也得到了加强。但是杜鲁门主义却给希、土两国人民带去了灾难，使两国的民族利益受到严重的损害。
    美国人一踏入希腊，共产党就被宣布为非法组织，恐怖统治日益加甚。在杜鲁门称之为“民主”政权的希腊保皇法西斯的统治下，希腊人民的民主力量受到严重的摧残，有五万人以上被捕，三千人被判处徒刑。自从1947年接受杜鲁门主义以来，土耳其公开地走上法西斯化的道路，建立了新的警察宪兵总部和监狱法庭，并将一切进步团体和领袖处死刑和无期徒刑。
    杜鲁门主义援助的条件，使希腊和土耳其处于附属美国的地位。美国控制了土耳其的财政、军事、内政、外交政策和整个国家机构。在土耳其有五千名美国“顾问”、 “专家”、“技术人员”等，盘踞在各个部门，他们享有特权，操纵了土耳其的内政和外交。驻在希腊的美国代表团实际上也是希腊的太上皇。他们公开指示希腊内阁应如何组织。他们决定希腊的经济政策，并建立由美国人监督一切的制度。根据美国同希腊签订的协定，美国可以派遣军队驻扎在希腊，其装备与物资可以免税自由出入希腊、自由调动、自由侵犯希腊的领水和领空。
    接受美援以后，希腊和土耳其的经济命脉逐渐落入美国垄断资本的手中。以美孚油公司和德士古公司为首的外国石油公司垄断了土耳其的石油。美国通用电气公司控制了土耳其的电气器材工业。美国的大通银行控制了土耳其的金融。同样，美国的国际电话电报公司接收了整个希腊的通讯系统。美国烟草公司霸占了希腊的烟叶加工和出口业务。美国的环球航空公司霸占了希腊的航线。
    希腊和土耳其的军事负担，从杜鲁门主义公布以后，日益加重。庞大的军费开支影响着两国的国家预算、信贷制度、对外贸易和工业发展。土耳其每年的军事预算都要占总预算的一半。巨额的军事开支造成了严重的通货膨胀。希腊的财政情况也日趋恶化。它每年的军事预算要占整个国家预算的50％以上。沉重的军事负担和通货膨胀使两国的国民经济受到破坏，劳动人民的生活水平急剧下降。在土耳其有两百多万人失业；在希腊，失业和半失业的数目也不下二百万。土耳其的工人生活费用已经比战前增加了三倍以上，但工资却提高得不多。据联合国欧洲经济委员会1955年的报告，希腊国内的消费量还没有达到战前的水平。
    美国还把希腊和土耳其变成了美国商品销售的市场和北大西洋公约集团各国的廉价原料供应地。战后希腊和土耳其对美国的贸易比重大大增加，英国在这两个国家的比重则大为下降。
    在杜鲁门主义公布的时候，美国的官方人士和报界都吹嘘说：杜鲁门主义为美国外交开辟了一条新的、划时代的道路。杜鲁门主义公布以后，美国垄断资本陆续采取了许多措施，来逐步实现其称霸全世界的政策。1947年夏天，美国国务卿马歇尔在哈佛大学发表演说，建议对欧洲各国进行经济“援助”，以便消除第二次世界大战的恶果。这就是后来的所谓马歇尔计划的开端。1948年4月，美国国会根据这个计划，通过了“援外法案”。根据这个法案，接受美援的国家应该在优惠的条件下输入美国商品，接受美国对援助使用的监督。这实际上是一个在复兴欧洲的幌子下剥夺欧洲国家经济和政治独立的计划。这个计划在它满期以前，实际上就被另一个主要是军事性的计划，所谓 “共同安全法”所代替。1949年4月，美国同比、加、丹、法、冰、意、卢、荷、挪、葡、英等十一国在华盛顿签订北大西洋公约，组成军事集团。美国还缔结了另外一些军事集团条约和许多双边的军事协定，作为这些集团条约的补充。
    在杜鲁门主义的指导下，美国的外交政策具有了愈来愈多的军国主义性质。军事集团，军事基地和军事援助，成为以杜鲁门主义开端的美国战后冷战和扩张政策的主要内容。在过去十年中间，美国在资本主义世界各处建立了成百的军事基地，把几十个国家拉进军事集团或双边的军事安排，用武器和军火的援助支撑了许多遭到人民唾弃的反动政权。美帝国主义这样作，一以阻遏社会主义影响的扩大，一以镇压资本主义世界中战后蓬勃发展的人民运动；同时，在号召其他国家进行反苏反共十字军运动的时候，实际上取得对于资本主义世界的控制，把自己的势力伸入到其他国家，使这些国家逐一成为它的附庸。
    十年来，在冷战的紧张局势掩护下，美国在树立自己在资本主义世界的霸权方面，在侵夺其他资本主义国家的权益方面，特别是在攫取英法帝国主义的既得殖民利益方面，确是取得了不少的果实。美国统治集团现在大吹大擂美国战后外交的胜利，其实际的意义也就在这里。但是在反苏反共方面，美帝国主义却遭到了决定性的挫折。
    第二次世界大战以后的最初年份里，美帝国主义迷信自己的实力和原子弹，并认为苏联已在反法西斯战争中大为削弱，吃不住同美国打另一次大战。它错误地以为，凭着它独有的原子弹和膨胀的钱袋，可以要全世界接受华尔街的意志。所以一度它非常嚣张，到处进行干涉和扩张。但是不久，事实就打破了美帝国主义的美梦。美国的干涉虽然在某些地区取得了局部的成功，但在一个最主要的战场上，在中国彻底和无可挽回地失败了。接着原子弹的垄断宣告破产。朝鲜战争以最有说服力的事实说明了，美国魔法师的本领不过如此。这结束了战后美国横行霸道的时代，并引起了对华盛顿外交政策的“沉痛的重新估价”。杜鲁门因为他自己所倡导和执行的“主义”而下了台。杜鲁门的下台标志了以他的名字命名的美国战后外交政策的失败。
    继任的艾森豪威尔政府在外交政策上，基本上仍遵循杜鲁门时期的路线，只是在偏重的地区、方面以及推行的方法和实施策略上有所不同。几年来又遭到许多失败和挫折。在朝鲜被迫停战。印度支那军事干涉计划失败。欧洲军计划被否决。“解放”政策只得改换口气。“放蒋介石出笼”政策被迫修正。局势趋向缓和。“战争边缘”的宣传引起强烈的抗议。反美情绪普遍上升。帝国主义之间的冲突表面化。各个军事集团内部离心倾向在发展。近来，美帝国主义者终于不得不承认，同社会主义国家共处是不可避免的现实，对社会主义阵营发动战争不可能取得胜利。这也就是承认了十年前提出来的“杜鲁门主义”所宣布的政策目标没有达到也无法达到。
    埃及战争后，美国帝国主义者认为有必要提出一个“新”的主义，来代替已经声名狼籍的杜鲁门主义。于是，所谓艾森豪威尔主义就出世了。艾森豪威尔主义和杜鲁门主义实际上是一脉相承的，但是来得更加狡猾、更加虚伪，并且更加是针对英法在中东和非洲的既得殖民利益和这个地区国家的民族利益的。
    以艾森豪威尔主义代替杜鲁门主义不表明美国的侵略和扩张性的外交政策有基本的改变，但是却是盖棺论定地表明了杜鲁门主义的彻底破产。
    一件意味深长的事情是，2月17日美国国务院新闻官怀特宣称，杜鲁门先生因另有约会，不能接受在杜鲁门主义公布十年纪念之际访问希腊和土耳其的邀请。看来，杜鲁门先生是不堪回首话当年了。
