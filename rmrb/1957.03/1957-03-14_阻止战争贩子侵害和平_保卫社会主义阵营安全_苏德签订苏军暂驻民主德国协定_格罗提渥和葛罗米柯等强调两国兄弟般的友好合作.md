    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 13th: The government delegations of the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union signed an agreement in Berlin on the evening of March 12 regarding the temporary stationing of Soviet armed forces on the territory of the German Democratic Republic.

    The agreement was signed on the German side by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Lothar Bolz and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense General Heinz Hoffmann; on the Soviet side by Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and Minister of Defense Marshal Georgy Zhukov.

    A joint communique issued at the conclusion of the signing ceremony stated: The joint statement issued in Moscow on January 7, 1957, by the government delegations of the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union pointed out that the two governments share a completely identical view on the world political situation, particularly the dangerous situation arising from the resurgence of West German militarism. Following this joint statement and in order to implement the measures decided upon in this joint statement, the government delegations of the two countries held negotiations in Berlin on the issue of the temporary stationing of Soviet armed forces on the territory of the German Democratic Republic. As a result of the negotiations, the two sides signed this agreement.

    Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl and First Deputy Prime Minister Walter Ulbricht of the German Democratic Republic, among others, attended the signing ceremony.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: According to TASS from Berlin: Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic hosted a banquet on March 12 in honor of Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and Soviet Defense Minister Georgy Zhukov.

    Grotewohl said at the banquet that it is necessary for Soviet troops to be temporarily stationed on the territory of the German Democratic Republic, because until now, the situation in Europe has not been able to provide sufficient guarantees for the peace and security of European countries, including Germany.

    He pointed out that in the Federal Republic of Germany, the militarism that has already been revived is plotting new aggression. The presence of Soviet troops prevents warmongers from infringing on peace, infringing on the socialist camp, and the German Democratic Republic. Grotewohl said that the talks between the two sides demonstrated a sincere spirit of proletarian internationalism.

    Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Lothar Bolz of the German Democratic Republic said: The agreement on the stationing of Soviet troops in the German Democratic Republic shows that the relationship between our two countries is based on the principles of respect for sovereignty, non-aggression, equality, brotherly cooperation, and proletarian internationalism.

    Gromyko also spoke at the banquet. He said that this meeting and its results are a brilliant example of the new type of international relations established between socialist countries.

    Gromyko pointed out that no matter how good the agreement signed this time is, the best thing for the German people and the Soviet people is to establish conditions that allow for the conclusion of a peace treaty with a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany and the withdrawal of all troops from Germany. He said that the Soviet government has long been striving to achieve this, but the Western countries and the government of the Federal Republic of Germany are creating more obstacles in this path year by year.

    Gromyko pointed out that the Soviet and German peoples understand most clearly how much misfortune war can bring. The residents of West Germany do not want war either. However, the measures of preparation for war taken by the Western countries force our two countries, like other peace-loving countries, to take appropriate measures to strengthen their own security.

    Gromyko expressed that the Soviet Union has close and truly friendly relations with the German Democratic Republic and is willing to establish good relations with the Federal Republic of Germany as well.

    Minister of National Defense Heinz Hoffmann of the German Democratic Republic said: In all measures to protect the German people, the Soviet troops are friends of the German Democratic Republic. The Soviet troops stationed in our country protect the security of all peace-loving people.

    Zhukov said that the current stationing of Soviet troops in Germany is necessary to ensure the security of our entire socialist camp and is based on the Potsdam Agreement and the Warsaw Treaty.

    In the cause of ensuring the security of the people of all countries in the socialist camp and defending peaceful labor, the Soviet troops work in close cooperation with the armies of the Warsaw Treaty member states. This also includes cooperation with the People's Army of the young German Democratic Republic.

    Zhukov said: The Soviet people will continue to carry out a tenacious struggle for world peace together with all peace-loving people. No matter how stubbornly the aggressive bloc resists. We believe that in the struggle for peace, the glorious German people and the armed forces of the German Democratic Republic will stand at the forefront with us, with the people of other socialist countries.

    First Deputy Prime Minister Walter Ulbricht, Deputy Prime Minister Nuschke, and Chairman of the People's Chamber Dieckmann of the German Democratic Republic also spoke at the banquet.

    阻止战争贩子侵害和平  保卫社会主义阵营安全
    苏德签订苏军暂驻民主德国协定
    格罗提渥和葛罗米柯等强调两国兄弟般的友好合作
    新华社柏林13日电  德意志民主共和国和苏联两国政府代表团12日晚间在柏林签订了关于苏联武装部队暂时在德意志民主共和国领土上驻扎的协定。
    在协定上签字的，德国方面是副总理兼外交部长博尔茨和副总理兼国防部长斯多夫上将；在苏联方面是外交部长葛罗米柯和国防部长朱可夫元帅。
    签字仪式结束时双方发表的联合公报说：1957年1月7日德意志民主共和国和苏联两国政府代表团在莫斯科发表的联合声明中指出，两国政府对于世界政治局势特别是由于西德军国主义的复活而产生的危险局势有着完全一致的看法。遵循着这项联合声明并且为了执行这项联合声明所决定采取的措施，两国政府代表团在柏林就有关苏联武装部队暂时在德意志民主共和国领土上驻扎的问题举行了谈判。谈判结果双方签订了这项协定。
    德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥和第一副总理乌布利希等人都参加了签字仪式。
    新华社13日讯  据塔斯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥3月12日设宴招待苏联外交部长葛罗米柯和苏联国防部长朱可夫。
    格罗提渥在宴会上讲话说，苏军暂时驻在德意志民主共和国领土上是有必要的，因为直到现在，欧洲的局面还没有能给包括德国在内的欧洲国家的和平和安全以足够的保障。
    他指出，在德意志联邦共和国境内，已经复活起来的军国主义正在策划新的侵略。苏军的留驻，阻止着战争贩子来侵害和平、侵害社会主义阵营和德意志民主共和国。格罗提渥说，在双方进行的会谈中表现了诚恳的无产阶级国际主义的精神。
    德意志民主共和国副总理兼外交部长博尔茨说：关于苏军留驻德意志民主共和国的协定表现出我们两国之间的关系是建立在尊重主权、互不侵犯、平等、兄弟合作和无产阶级国际主义的原则的基础上的。
    葛罗米柯也在宴会上讲了话。他说，这次会谈及其结果是社会主义国家间建立的新型国际关系的卓越范例。
    葛罗米柯指出，无论这次签订的协定多么好，但是对德国人民以及苏联人民说来，最好的还是建立起可以同统一、和平、民主的德国签订和约和一切军队撤离德国的条件。他说，苏联政府早就在争取实现这一点，但是西方国家和德意志联邦共和国政府却在这条道路上制造着一年比一年更多的障碍。
    葛罗米柯指出，苏联和德国人民对战争会带来如何巨大的不幸了解得最清楚。西德居民也不要战争。然而西方国家所采取的备战措施迫使我们两国像其他爱好和平国家一样不得不采取加强自己安全的适当措施。
    葛罗米柯表示，苏联同德意志民主共和国有着紧密的、真正友好的关系，同时愿意同德意志联邦共和国也建立起良好关系。
    德意志民主共和国国防部长斯多夫讲话说：在保卫德国人民的一切措施中，苏军都是德意志民主共和国的朋友。苏军驻在我国保卫着一切爱好和平的各国人民的安全。
    朱可夫说，目前苏军留驻德境是出于保障我们整个社会主义阵营的必要，并且是以波茨坦协定和华沙条约为根据的。
    在保障社会主义阵营各国人民的安全和保卫和平劳动的事业中，苏军同华沙条约各缔约国的军队通力协作。其中也包括年轻的德意志民主共和国国家人民军的合作。
    朱可夫说：苏联人民今后仍将和一切爱好和平的人民共同进行争取世界和平的顽强斗争。不管侵略集团如何顽抗。我们相信，在争取和平的斗争中，光荣的德国人民和德意志民主共和国的武装部队将同我们，同其他社会主义国家的人民站在最先列。
    德意志民主共和国第一副总理乌布利希、副总理努舍克和人民议院主席狄克曼也在宴会上讲了话。
