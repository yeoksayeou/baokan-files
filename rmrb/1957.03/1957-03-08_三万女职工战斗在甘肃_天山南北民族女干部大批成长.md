Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 7th -- The number of female workers in Gansu Province is currently nearly 30,000, more than ten times the number in 1952. On all fronts, including basic construction, geological exploration, factories and mines, transportation, commerce and trade, and culture and education, they are undertaking duties such as surveying, drilling, engineering design, construction scheduling, high-pressure welding, driving cars, operating bulldozers, working as lathe operators, telephone operators, and salespersons, making significant achievements.

In the past year, a total of 462 female industrial advanced producers and 835 female advanced workers have emerged throughout the province. Wang Xiongying, a Guangdong girl who came to Liujiaxia from the Sanmenxia construction site, improved the leveling route plan in the water level measurement of the Longyangxia section of the upper reaches of Liujiaxia in September last year. Not only did she complete the measurement task ahead of schedule, but she also saved the country more than 3,000 yuan in funds. Due to her outstanding work performance, she has been repeatedly selected as an advanced worker. Xiao Sufang and Zhou Cuilan, two female high-pressure welders at the Lanzhou Thermal Power Plant construction site, mastered high-temperature and high-pressure welding technology after only six months of learning, and the quality of their welding generally meets national requirements.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 7th -- The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has cultivated a large number of female cadres from ethnic minorities. At present, there are more than 4,900 female cadres from Uyghur, Kazakh, Hui, Mongolian, Kyrgyz, and other ethnic minorities in party and government organs at all levels in the autonomous region, as well as in various institutions and enterprises.

    三万女职工战斗在甘肃
    天山南北民族女干部大批成长
    据新华社兰州7日电　甘肃省女职工目前人数将近三万人，比1952年增加了十几倍。她们在基本建设、地质勘探、厂矿企业、交通运输、商业贸易和文化教育等各个战线上，担任着测量、钻探、工程设计、施工调度、高压焊接、汽车司机、推土机手、车工、话务员和营业员等职务，做出了很大成绩。
    近一年来，全省共涌现出女工业先进生产者四百六十二人，女先进工作者八百三十五人。从三门峡工地来到刘家峡的广东姑娘王雄英，去年9月在刘家峡上游龙羊峡的水准测量中，改进了测量水准路线方案，不但提前完成了测量任务，还给国家节省资金三千多元。由于她工作成绩优异，屡次被评选为先进工作者。兰州热电站工地的两名女高压焊工萧素芳和周翠兰，只经过六个月的学习就已经掌握了高温高压电焊技术，电焊质量一般都合乎国家要求。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐7日电　新疆维吾尔自治区培养出了大批少数民族妇女干部。现在自治区各级党和政府机关以及各事业、企业单位中，维吾尔、哈萨克、回、蒙古、柯尔克孜等少数民族妇女干部共有四千九百多名。目前在巴音郭楞蒙古族自治州、阿克苏专区和疏勒、鄯善、乌恰、乌鲁木齐、喀什市等十二个县、市，都有了少数民族的女副州长、副专员、副县长和副市长。在各级党组织和政府机构的各部门中担负领导职务的更多。这些少数民族妇女干部都受到了各族人民的爱戴。
