I completely agree with and support the reports by Premier Zhou, Vice Chairman Chen, and Vice Premier Li, and will strive to study and implement them in my work. I feel greatly honored to participate in this meeting. I saw the central leaders and listened to their instructions. Moreover, I am even more moved that a local cadre of a minority nationality like me can participate in a State Council meeting personally convened by Chairman Mao to discuss national affairs and hear Chairman Mao's teachings. This makes me deeply realize that only in a people's own country can such things happen. Therefore, I also feel the warmth and loveliness of the motherland's national family, which further strengthens my trust in the motherland, Chairman Mao, and the Communist Party, and enhances my confidence in actively participating in the construction of the motherland. At the same time, Chairman Mao's instructions on national issues at the State Council meeting made me even more aware of the greatness and correctness of the ethnic policies of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. I would like to make the following speech based on my experience and thoughts on the implementation of ethnic policies during my inspection. Please correct any inappropriate points.

The Party's Ethnic Policy in Gansu:
The Victory of Three Hui Autonomous Prefectures

Implementing regional autonomy is the most correct policy for the Chinese Communist Party to solve China's ethnic problems by applying Marxist-Leninist theory on ethnic issues. National unity and ethnic equality are one of the basic principles of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The practical experience of the past few years has proved that this conforms to the long-term common demands of all ethnic groups in terms of rights. The unification and prosperity of the motherland are also the common interests of all ethnic groups. An important form of strengthening national unity and implementing ethnic equality is to implement ethnic regional autonomy within a unified motherland. Only in this way can sufficient possibilities be provided for cooperation between all ethnic groups within a unified country. It can take into account the common interests of the people of the whole country, as well as the interests and characteristics of all ethnic groups, and can give play to the initiative of all ethnic groups in being masters of their own affairs, enabling them to perfectly utilize the natural resources of their regions, develop productive forces, and further strengthen the relationship between the border areas and the central government, and enhance the unification of the motherland. The results of the implementation of regional autonomy in the three Hui autonomous prefectures of Wuzhong, Guyuan, and Linxia in Gansu Province fully demonstrate that the patriotic enthusiasm of all ethnic groups, national unity, and the close relationship between the people and the autonomous organs are unprecedented. Moreover, it has gradually promoted the common development of the economy and culture of all ethnic groups, and the socialist transformation has also achieved a decisive victory. In Tongxin County, Wuzhong, there were only more than 28,000 people at the beginning of liberation, and only more than 100,000 sheep. After the establishment of the autonomous prefecture, people who had fled abroad felt that Chairman Mao allowed the Hui people to be masters of their own affairs and returned to their homes to build their careers and vigorously develop production. Currently, the county's population has increased to more than 82,000 people, and the number of sheep has increased to more than 320,000. With the development of agricultural cooperation, the area of ​​paddy fields in these areas has rapidly expanded, and the yield of crops has greatly increased. Linxia originally had more than 200,000 mu of paddy fields, which have now expanded to more than 400,000 mu. Grain production increased by more than 230 million jin last year. Tongxin County originally had more than 3,000 mu of paddy fields, which have now expanded to more than 18,000 mu. Last year, the total grain output was 100.6 million jin, enough for the entire county to eat for two and a half years. Local industries such as power plants, flour mills, and iron factories have also been established. Cultural and health undertakings have greatly developed, and the number of middle and primary school students has increased year by year. Last year, the number of middle and normal school students in Wuzhong increased by more than three times compared with the previous year. A large number of health technicians from all ethnic groups have grown up, and various local diseases have been greatly reduced. After a series of class struggles and production struggles, ethnic relations have been established on a new socialist economic basis. For example, the ethnic estrangement left over from history in Linxia has been basically eliminated due to the correct implementation of the Party's ethnic policy. The idea of ​​national unity has taken root in the hearts of the people, and unity in production has become the slogan of action for all ethnic groups. Therefore, many unity cooperatives and shops have emerged. Profound trust has been generated between ethnic groups. In the struggle against natural disasters, the Hui and Han people have shown a high degree of friendship and mutual assistance. Last year, six Hui communes including Jian'shang in Malian'tan Township, Linxia, ​​suffered hail disasters. More than 200 people and more than 30 pairs of livestock from nearby Han communes came to help replant autumn fields in three days, ensuring the lives of the Hui people.

On the basis of the improvement of the production of all ethnic groups, the improvement of material and cultural life, and the consolidation of national unity, cadres of all ethnic groups have also grown up. This is the key to ensuring the smooth development of the economic and cultural construction undertakings of minority nationalities. In recent years, these areas have boldly and freely cultivated a large number of ethnic cadres, and most of them have achieved victory through complex ideological struggles. Some leading cadres of counties and cities were originally shepherds, small business operators, correspondents or clerks, etc., and were trained after several years of training. For example, Comrade He Yongjie, secretary of the Tongxin County Party Committee, was originally a shepherd. According to the understanding in October last year, there were 3,295 cadres of six minority nationalities including Hui and Dongxiang in Linxia, ​​accounting for 42.6% of the total number of cadres, and there were 398 key members at the district head level or above, of which 55 have served as county secretaries, county heads and other leading positions. Most counties and cities have equipped minority ethnic leading cadres in various departments of party and government organs and mass organizations. Twenty-eight of the party and government leaders in the seven counties and cities of Linxia are minority ethnic cadres. Minority ethnic cadres in Tongxin County account for 56.4% of the total number of cadres, of which 48 are minority ethnic key members, accounting for 49%, and there are six county heads and secretaries, three Hui and three Han.

Party organizations have also been generally established. There are 4,316 minority ethnic party members in Linxia, ​​accounting for 46.6%. There are also minority ethnic workers in factories and enterprises, and they have mastered certain technologies. Democratic figures and patriotic religious figures from all ethnic groups have also made significant progress in ideological awareness and learning under the unity and education of the Party and through the practice of work. Most of them have shown labor enthusiasm in the socialist construction cause, and have also played a major role in democratic life such as political consultation, joint work, and mutual supervision.

Make efforts in many ways to strengthen national unity

Based on the above experience, the following opinions and requirements are put forward for further strengthening national work and enhancing national unity in the future:
      (1) It is requested that the establishment of the Hui Autonomous Region be realized as soon as possible to accelerate socialist construction. In order to implement the basic policies on national issues and realize the common tasks of the Party and the people of all nationalities in national issues, the central government has previously consulted with local authorities and prepared to establish a Hui Autonomous Region in the northeast of Gansu Province. The vast people of all nationalities in Yinchuan, Wuzhong, and Guyuan, especially the Hui people, believe that this is the long-cherished wish of the Hui people and is in complete accord with the common interests of all ethnic groups. This correct measure to be implemented by the central government will further enhance the love and trust of the Hui people for the motherland, Chairman Mao, and the Communist Party. In addition to expressing our warm support and firm support, we also hope that it will be realized soon, because only in this way can the Hui people realize the right to be masters of their own affairs and develop their own nation according to their own characteristics; they can also unite all fraternal nationalities on the basis of complete equality of rights, help each other, cooperate, so as to accelerate the development of minority nationalities in economic and cultural aspects, thoroughly eliminate the de facto inequality between nationalities, and jointly enter socialism.
      (2) Continue to boldly select minority ethnic cadres, give full play to the functions of autonomous organs, and the role of minority ethnic cadres in national construction. Although Gansu Province has made certain achievements in training ethnic cadres, it is still far from enough from the perspective of the needs of the development of national undertakings, and the distribution is not balanced enough. Many departments that need ethnic cadres, such as culture, education, health, and enterprises, are still very short of ethnic cadres, especially ethnic party and government leading cadres, technical cadres, and women cadres. It is required to vigorously select ethnic cadres, especially technical cadres, and gradually make the number of ethnic cadres in the administrative, enterprise, cultural, educational, health, and people's organizations under the autonomous organs account for the majority. In ethnic mixed areas, cadres should be assigned in proportion to their ethnic population, and they should be primarily responsible for their work, in order to establish the ethnic self-esteem of minority ethnic cadres who have positions, powers, and responsibilities in their work, and cherish their enthusiasm for loving the legitimate interests of their own nation, so as to make their connection with the people of their own nation closer and give play to their active role in national construction. At the same time, consolidate and expand the ethnic united front, strengthen the consultation work with ethnic religious figures, help them to study and progress politically, and strive for the support of a wider range of social forces to successfully complete the construction of the motherland.
      (3) Vigorously help minority nationalities develop economic and cultural construction undertakings, and pay attention to focusing on developing industry in minority nationality areas. Yinchuan, Wuzhong, Guyuan and other places have great potential in agriculture and animal husbandry and have broad development prospects. Most areas remain to be developed. The Yellow River water conservancy resources should be fully utilized to develop agricultural and animal husbandry production. The higher-level party and government should provide strong support in technology and materials, and special needs should be appropriately taken care of based on the actual conditions of these areas. Under the principle of national unified planning, supplementary measures applicable to ethnic areas should be made and enthusiastic help should be given. This will not only provide a reliable material foundation for ensuring industrial construction, improving the lives of people of all ethnic groups, and eliminating de facto inequality between ethnic groups, but also open up avenues for resettling some unemployed people in the country in the future. At the same time, these areas are also rich in mineral resources. The Ordos oil field, the Qingtongxia water conservancy irrigation project, and the Helan Mountain coal field are all modern industries that the state plans to open soon. The completion of these industries will play a decisive role in cultivating the minority ethnic working class and promoting the development of agriculture and animal husbandry in minority ethnic areas. In the construction undertakings of minority nationalities, cultural construction is, in a certain sense, a prerequisite for economic construction. Special attention should be paid to cultivating construction talents in culture, education, health, technology, etc. of minority nationalities, so as to enable them to participate in construction. At present, although cultural and educational undertakings in these areas have greatly improved, they still cannot meet the needs, and there are many difficulties in funding, equipment, etc. Many middle school students cannot afford to study and drop out of school due to family difficulties; the equipment of some primary schools is very poor, and some are temporarily set up in mosques, which is very inconvenient. It is hoped that the central government will investigate and understand these situations, propose specific measures, and give special support to facilitate the development of cultural and educational undertakings.
      (4) Conduct the propaganda and education work of ethnic policies more deeply and universally, strengthen the education combining patriotism and internationalism, so that people and cadres of all ethnic groups correctly understand the relationship between ethnic groups, eliminate the remnants of Han chauvinism and local nationalism, consolidate unity, and overcome the view of some Han cadres that ethnic relations are a simple and absolute relationship between the Han nationality helping minority nationalities, and the guest mentality of some minority ethnic cadres, correctly understand the relationship between ethnic groups, help each other, and support each other, appropriately estimate the important significance of Han cadres helping minority nationalities develop politics, economy, and culture, and the role of minority nationalities in national life, so that minority nationalities can establish a confident mentality of being masters of their own affairs under the enthusiastic help of the Han nationality, and give full play to their active role in socialist construction. At the same time, appropriately expand the financial power of autonomous organs to facilitate economic and cultural construction, and fully protect the rights of autonomous organs, and establish a working attitude and sense of responsibility for ethnic cadres to have positions and powers; in socialist transformation, special attention should be paid to protecting the customs and habits and religious beliefs of minority nationalities, and the right of this nation to maintain or reform by itself, and no one is allowed to discriminate or interfere. For some mosques that are currently facing difficulties in the lives of Ahongs and Mullahs due to the entry of land into the cooperatives, it is necessary to help them to obtain appropriate solutions. It is required that a small amount of land in the mosques should not be entered into the cooperatives for the time being, and should be left to the Ahongs and Mullahs to cultivate and support themselves under the principle of voluntary help from the Hui masses, so as to maintain the life of the temples, close the relationship between people of all ethnic groups, smoothly complete the national construction cause, and jointly transition to socialism.

    进一步加强民族工作
    马昆山的发言
    我完全同意并拥护周总理、陈副主席、李副总理的报告，努力学习在工作中贯彻执行。我参加这次会议感到很大光荣，看到了中央首长并听取了首长们的指示，而且更感动的是像我这样的少数民族地方干部能够参加毛主席亲召的国务会议商讨国家大事，并听到毛主席的教导，使我深深体会到只有人民自己的国家，才能有这样的事情，因而也感到祖国民族大家庭的温暖和可爱，进一步增强了我对祖国和毛主席、共产党的信赖，增强了我积极参加祖国建设的信心。同时，毛主席在国务会议上关于民族问题的指示，使我更加体会到毛主席、共产党的民族政策的伟大正确，我谨以视察中对民族政策执行情况的体会和感想作如下发言，不妥之处，请指正。
    党的民族政策在甘肃
    三个回族自治州的胜利
    实现区域自治是中国共产党运用马列主义关于民族问题的学说来解决我国民族问题最正确的政策，民族团结和民族平等是中华人民共和国建国的基本原则之一。几年来的生活实践证明这是符合各族人民在权利方面长期以来的共同要求的。祖国的统一和富强也是各族人民的共同利益，而加强民族团结、实行民族平等的重要形式是在统一的祖国内实行民族区域自治。只有这样才能为各民族在统一国家内的合作提供充分的可能性，它既能考虑到全国人民的共同利益，又能照顾到各民族的利益和特点，并能发挥各民族当家作主的主动性，使他们完善地利用本区的天然富源，发展生产力，进而密切边疆与中央的关系，增强祖国的统一。甘肃省的吴忠、固原、临夏三个回族自治州实行区域自治的结果，充分说明各族人民的爱国主义积极性、民族团结和人民同自治机关间的密切关系都是空前的；而且逐渐促进了各族人民经济文化的共同发展，社会主义改造也已取得了决定性的胜利。吴忠的同心县解放初只有二万八千多人，羊只仅有十余万只，自治州成立后曾逃亡在外的人，感到毛主席让回民当家作主而纷纷归里建家立业，大力发展生产，至目前全县人口增加到八万二千多人，羊只增加到三十二万多只。随着农业合作化的发展，这些地区的水田面积迅速扩大，农作物的产量有很大提高。临夏原有二十余万亩水田，现扩大到四十余万亩，粮食去年增产二亿三千多万斤；同心县原有水田三千多亩，现扩大到一万八千多亩，去年粮食总产一亿零六百多万斤，够全县人吃二年半。电厂、面粉厂、铁工厂等地方工业也建立起来。文化卫生事业有很大的发展，中、小学生逐年增加。吴忠的中学和师范学生，去年比前年增加三倍以上。各族的卫生技术人员大批成长起来，各种地方病大有减少。经过一系列的阶级斗争和生产斗争，民族关系在新的社会主义的经济基础上建立起来，如临夏在历史上遗留下来的民族隔阂，由于党的民族政策的正确实现，基本消除，民族团结思想深入人心，团结生产已成为各族人民的行动口号，因而出现了好多团结社、商店等。民族间产生了深厚的信任，在同自然灾害斗争中回汉人民表现了高度的友爱、互助精神，临夏麻莲滩乡涧上等六个回民社去年遭受雹灾，附近汉民社三天来了二百余人，三十余对牲畜帮助抢种上秋田，保证了回民的生活。
    在各族人民生产的提高、物质文化生活的改善、民族团结更巩固的基础上，各民族自己的干部也生长起来，这是保证少数民族经济文化建设事业顺利发展的关键性问题。几年来，这些地区大胆放手地培养了大批民族干部，而且大都是经过复杂的思想斗争取得胜利的。有些县市的领导干部原是牧羊、经营小商贩、当通讯员或店员等极平凡的贫苦人家子弟，几年来经过锻炼而培养起来的，如同心县委书记贺永洁同志原是牧羊的。据去年10月间了解，临夏有回、东乡等六个少数民族的干部三千二百九十五人，占干部总数的42.6％，有区长级以上骨干三百九十八人，其中有五十五人已担任着县书、县长以上领导职务。多数县市在党政机关和群众团体的各个部门都配备了少数民族的正副职领导骨干。临夏七个县市的党政负责人有二十八个是少数民族干部。同心县少数民族干部占干部总数的56.4％，其中有少数民族骨干四十八人，占49％，县长、书记六人，回汉各三人。
    党的组织也普遍建立了起来。临夏少数民族党员四千三百一十六名，占46.6％。在工厂和企业里也有了少数民族的工人，而且掌握了一定的技术。各民族中的民主人士和宗教爱国人士，在党的团结教育下，经过工作的实践锻炼，思想觉悟和学习进步也有了显著提高。在社会主义建设事业中大都表现了劳动积极性，在政治协商、共同工作、互相监督等民主生活中也发挥了重大作用。从多方面努力来增强民族团结
    根据上述体会，对今后进一步加强民族工作，增进民族团结，提出以下意见和要求：
      （一）要求早日实现回族自治区的成立，以加速社会主义建设。中央为了贯彻关于民族问题的基本政策，以实现党和各民族人民在民族问题方面的共同任务，前已与地方协商并准备在甘肃省东北部成立回族自治区，银川、吴忠、固原的各族广大人民，特别是回族人民认为这是回族人民长期以来梦寐以求的愿望，是完全符合各族人民的共同利益的，中央这一将实现的正确措施，将更加增进回族人民对祖国和毛主席共产党的热爱和信赖，我们除了表示热烈拥护和坚决支持外，并盼望很快地实现，因为只有这样，才可以实现回族人民当家作主的权利，按照自己的特点来发展自己的民族；又可以在权利完全平等的基础上，团结各兄弟民族，互助合作，以加速少数民族在经济、文化方面的发展，彻底消除民族间的事实上的不平等，共同进入社会主义。
      （二）继续大胆选拔少数民族干部，充分发挥自治机关的职能，和少数民族干部在国家建设中的作用。甘肃省在培养民族干部方面虽取得了一定成绩，但从国家的事业发展需要上看，还是很不够的，而且分布的不够平衡，好多需要民族干部的部门如文教、卫生及企事业等还很缺乏民族干部，尤其是少数民族的党政领导干部、技术干部和妇女干部更感不足。要求大力选拔民族干部，特别是技术干部，逐步使自治机关所属的行政、企事业、文教卫生以及人民团体的少数民族干部在数量上占多数，在民族杂居地区应分配与其民族人口相适应的干部，在工作上负主要责任，以便树立少数民族干部在工作中有职、有权、有责任的民族自尊心，并珍惜他们热爱自己民族正当利益的热情，使之同本民族人民的联系更加密切，发挥他们在国家建设中的积极作用。同时巩固和扩大民族统战、加强对民族宗教人士的协商工作，从政治上帮助他们学习进步，争取更广泛的社会力量的支持，胜利完成祖国建设事业。
      （三）大力帮助少数民族发展经济文化建设事业，注意在少数民族地区重点发展工业。银川、吴忠、固原等地的农牧业潜力很大，有着广阔发展的前途，大部分地区尚待开发，应充分利用黄河水利资源，发展农牧业生产，在技术和物资上，要求上级党政给予大力的扶助，并根据这些地区的实际情况，适当照顾一些特殊需要，在国家统一计划的原则下，做出适用民族地区的补充办法，给以热情帮助，这样不仅可以给保证工业建设，改善各族人民生活，消除民族间事实上不平等提供可靠的物质基础，而且为今后安置国内一些失业的人开辟道路。同时这些地区的矿藏也很丰富，鄂尔多斯的油田，青铜峡的水利灌溉工程，贺兰山的煤田等都是国家计划即要开的现代工业，这些工业的建成将对培养少数民族工人阶级，推动少数民族地区农牧业的发展是有决定性作用的。少数民族的建设事业中文化建设在一定的意义上是经济建设的先决条件，应特别注意培养少数民族的文教、卫生、技术等建设人材，使其参加建设。目前这些地区的文教事业虽有很大提高，但还不能满足需要，在经费、设备等方面有好多困难，很多中学生因家庭生活困难得不到扶助而念不起书退了学；有些小学校设备很差，还有的暂设在清真寺院里，甚感不便。这些情况希望中央调查了解，提出具体措施，加以特殊扶助，以利文教事业的发展。
      （四）更深入普遍地开展民族政策的宣传教育工作，加强爱国主义和国际主义相结合的教育，使各族人民和干部正确地理解民族之间的关系，消除大汉族主义和地方民族主义残余，巩固团结，克服某些汉族干部把民族关系看成是单纯的、绝对的汉族帮助少数民族的关系，和部分少数民族干部的作客思想，正确地认识各民族间的关系，互相帮助，互相支援，恰当地估计汉族干部帮助少数民族发展政治、经济、文化的重要意义和少数民族在国家生活中的作用，使少数民族在汉族的热心帮助下，树立当家作主的自信心理，在社会主义建设中充分发挥其积极作用。同时适当扩大自治机关的财权，以利于经济文化的建设，并充分保障自治机关的权利，树立民族干部有职有权的工作态度和责任感；在社会主义改造中特别注意保障少数民族的风俗习惯和宗教信仰，由本民族自己保持或者改革的权利，不许别人歧视或者干涉。对目前一些清真寺因土地入社阿訇、满拉生活发生困难的，需要帮助他们得到适当的解决，要求清真寺的少量土地暂不入社，留给阿訇、满拉在回民群众自愿帮助的原则下，自耕自给，以维持寺院生活，密切各族人民关系，顺利完成国家建设事业，共同过渡到社会主义。（附图片）
