Cars Speeding on the Ancient Yinping Road
    Yan Shugui

    In the early morning, we boarded a car and set off from Wudu County, Gansu Province, heading towards Wen County.

    The rugged mountain road we traveled passed through the historically famous and险峻 ancient Yinping Road. During the Three Kingdoms period, Wei general Deng Ai, in order to compete for merit with Zhong Hui, risked a great deal to advance into Sichuan from here, conquering the Shu Han dynasty that ruled Sichuan. In the Biography of Deng Ai in the Records of the Three Kingdoms, this advance is described as follows: "In the tenth month of winter, Ai marched from Yinping (now Wen County) on a route through uninhabited land for over seven hundred li, carving paths through mountains and building bridges. The mountains were high and the valleys deep, making it extremely difficult and dangerous; moreover, the grain supply was on the verge of exhaustion and frequent danger. Ai wrapped himself in felt and rolled down, while his soldiers climbed on trees and clung to cliffs, advancing in single file..." The Romance of the Three Kingdoms describes this section even more perilously.

    As the car left Wudu and reached Xianya Dam, eighteen kilometers away, everyone exclaimed in surprise at the extraordinary ruggedness of the project. What an unimaginable feat of engineering! Along both banks of the Bailong River were cliffs hundreds of meters high, behind which were overlapping mountain peaks reaching into the sky. The rolling waves of the Bailong River cut diagonally from the northwest, swirling into a large vortex at the bottom of the cliff, and then rushing straight down. The roadbed was built from rocks blasted from the mountains and piled up from the river, and the car sped between the surging river and the steep cliffs.

    At this moment, someone shouted loudly to us: "Look up, look at the Celestial Bridge and the Stairway Road!" We looked in the direction he was pointing, and in the middle of a straight cliff, fifty meters high, hung an arc-shaped bridge supported by stone sheds. This is the Celestial Bridge. At both ends of the bridge, there were passages about one meter wide clinging to the cliff, which were layers of steps carved by hand. It is said that these projects were built during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty and the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, the government hired a large number of laborers at the cost of "one sheng of stone, one sheng of hemp money" to carve it into this shape. However, this place was never able to "turn danger into safety," and countless people and animals fell from here and drowned or were killed. Now, this celestial bridge hangs there empty, becoming a historical site for pedestrians to admire.

    The car then entered Dafoye Bay. A stone mountain hundreds of meters high extended from the northeast, intersecting the road line. The roadbed was blasted from the middle of the mountain. The car passed through the middle of the mountain and reached the Nine Sisters Ridge. This is composed of nine neatly arranged mountain peaks. The ninth and smallest peak had already been blown away, and the car passed over it.

    As we were marveling at the Nine Sisters Ridge project, we suddenly discovered that the road ahead was broken. A large mountain extending from the due east to the bank of the Bailong River blocked our way, which was the famous Diaomang Cliff. The blue rocks on the mountain looked like scales on a python. When we walked to its front, we found that the head of the python had been cleverly blasted off by the road workers, and the roadbed was opened up against the cliff.

    We, the passengers who were taking this road for the first time, enjoyed every project with our eyes wide open, and our mouths continued to praise. This aroused the interest of a comrade from the Wudu Prefectural Commissioner's Office who was guiding our tour, and he excitedly introduced the construction situation to us.

    "This is nothing! If you could have come and seen it before the construction, and experienced the feeling of 'stepping on a nest and climbing a cliff,' that would have been really dangerous. When we built the forty-meter-wide roadbed for Xianya Dam, it took a lot of effort. The slope there was completely like a knife cut, and there was no place to stand at all, and below was the rolling Bailong River. Therefore, the surveying work for this section of the road only made two control points at both ends, and no one passed through the middle. When the construction started, the migrant workers first climbed to the Celestial Bridge and used ropes to hang people down from the air, and then climbed on the rocks to start drilling holes. At that time, black explosives were still used. After the people went down and set off the cannons, they immediately climbed up the ropes. We blasted and repaired the working face one square meter at a time, preparing the conditions for the large cannons. Diaomang Cliff is a steep wall dozens of meters high. We selected two capable migrant workers who climbed up barefoot. After they climbed up, they nailed a few iron stakes on it and put up scaffolding before others went up. After many large cannons were fired continuously, the road was built as it is today. If it wasn't so difficult, this road would have been opened long ago. The Wuwen Highway is a section of the Ganchuan Highway. Who doesn't know it's important? The Kuomintang government called for it for many years and prepared to repair it several times, but when they encountered stone, they gave up after a few tries. Until today, thanks to the infinite wisdom of the liberated people, we have finally overcome these natural dangers and built this highway."

    At this time, the car passed through Shedaotui Cliff, Heifeng Gou, Diaohu Cliff and other places, and entered Fengjiaba. The sound of the car became low, and it crawled laboriously towards the Caoping Liang, two thousand meters above sea level. This is one of the great mountains in Wen County. The car circled back and forth on this mountain, passing through more than twenty winding roads. When the car drove to the highest point, standing up to look at the several passenger cars traveling with us, our eyes could not help but be blurred. The car was moving forward, but suddenly it seemed to be driving backwards along the mountain ditch; the vehicles that were running behind us suddenly seemed to be running in front of us. This is truly a spectacle.

    The county seat of Wen County is almost here. The host seemed to deliberately want us to have a general understanding of this road, and told us in a concluding tone:

    "The total length of this highway is 146 kilometers. The construction time was very short. The whole road was opened to traffic in November 1956, which took only eight months. The construction experience of this road tells us that after agricultural cooperativization, in places like Wudu with high mountains and deep valleys, it is entirely possible to build local roads that are accessible in all directions. Now we have cultivated a strong road construction team. Nearly a hundred skilled migrant workers have gone to Liujiaxia, Jingtieshan, Bailongjiang and other places to support highway construction and river blasting and repair projects."

    In the vast twilight, we arrived in Wen County, where "all the mountains are steep cliffs, and no water can pass a boat." When the first batch of cars drove to this small mountain town, thousands of farmers from dozens of miles around came to watch. They happily stroked every part of the car, rejoicing at the end of the history of being unable to transport local specialties out and industrial products in, and welcoming the major changes in production and life that were about to take place.

　　汽车奔驰在古阴平道上
　　燕树桂
    清晨，我们搭上汽车，从甘肃省武都县动身，向文县驰去。
    这条崎岖的山区公路经过的地方，便是历史上以险峻著名的古阴平道。三国时魏将邓艾为了同锺会争功，曾冒着很大危险从这里进军四川，征服了统治着四川的蜀汉王朝。在三国志邓艾传中，对这次进军有过这样的描写：“冬十月艾自阴平（即现在的文县）道行无人之地七百余里，凿山通道，造作桥阁。山高谷深，至为艰险；又粮运将匮频于危殆，艾以毡自裹，推转而下，将士皆攀木缘崖鱼贯而进……”。三国演义一书对这一段写得更为艰险。
    当汽车离开武都十八公里到达险崖坝的时候，大家还都为这一工程出奇的险峻而惊异得叫喊起来。这是一个多么难以设想的工程啊！沿着白龙江两岸，全是几百公尺高的悬崖陡壁，在它们的后面又是高接云天的重叠山峰。波浪滚滚的白龙江从西北方向斜插过来，在悬崖底下旋成一个很大的漩涡，然后急流直泻下去。公路的路基是用山上炸下来的石头从河里垫起来的，汽车就奔驰在澎湃的江水和险峻的峭壁之间。
    这时候，有人大声地告诉我们：“快向上看，看天仙桥和阶梯道！”我们顺着他手指的方向看去，在笔直的陡壁半腰五十公尺高的地方，空悬着一条弧形的由石头棚架起来的桥。这就是天仙桥。桥的两端，有贴着峭壁的宽约一公尺的通道，这里是由人工凿成的层层高升的阶梯道。据说这些工程修建于明万历年间和清同治年间。当时官府以“一升石头，一升麻钱”的代价雇佣大量人工凿成了这个样子。但是，这儿始终没有能够“化险为夷”，从这里滚下来淹死和摔死的人畜，不知有多少。现在，这座仙桥空空荡荡地悬在那里，成为行人欣赏的古迹。
    汽车接着进入大佛爷湾。一个几百公尺高的石山从东北方向伸展过来，恰好和公路线交叉起来。路基就是从山中间炸出来的。汽车由山中间穿过，到达了九姊妹梁。这是由整整齐齐的九个山峰组成的。第九个最小的山峰已经被炸掉，汽车就从这上面经过。
    我们正在赞叹九姊妹梁工程，忽然发现前面的路断了。一条从正东方延伸到白龙江边的大山横阻着我们的去路，这便是著名的吊蟒崖。山上青色的岩石，仿佛蟒身上的鳞片。等到我们走到它的跟前，才发现蟒的头部已由开山工人巧妙地炸掉一部分，贴着峭壁开出了公路的路基。
    我们这些首次走这条路的乘客，目不暇接地欣赏着每一个工程，嘴里也不断地赞叹着。这引起了引导我们游览的武都专署的一位同志的兴致，他兴奋地向我们介绍了施工的情况。
    “这已经不算什么了！要能在施工前来看看，体会一下‘脚登窝窝手攀崖’的味道，那才真是艰险呢。我们修险崖坝那四十公尺宽的路基的时候，可真费了不少劲啊。那里的山坡完全像刀子削了一样，根本没有站脚的地方，而下面又是滚滚的白龙江。所以这段路的测量工作，只在两端作了两个控制点，中间部分人就没有过去。开始施工的时候，民工先爬到天仙桥上，用绳子把人从高空吊下来，再攀着岩石，着手打眼。那时候用的还是黑色炸药，人下去把炮点好以后，又马上攀着绳子爬上来。我们就这样一方半方地炸修工作面，为放大炮准备条件。吊蟒崖是几十公尺高的一个陡壁。我们挑了两个精干的民工，光着脚硬是爬了上去。他们爬上去以后，在上面钉了几根铁桩，搭上了脚手架，别的人才上去。连续放了很多大炮，才修成了今天这样的道路。要不是这样困难，这条路早就修通啦。武文公路是甘川公路的一段，谁不知道它很重要呢？国民党政府叫了好多年，张罗着修了好几次，结果遇到石方，碰了几下就搁下来了。直到今天，由于解放了的人民发挥出无穷的智慧，才终于克服了这些天险，把这条公路修成。”
    这时，汽车穿过蛇倒退崖、黑风沟、吊虎崖等地方，进入了冯家坝。汽车的响声变得低沉起来，它吃力地向拔海两千公尺的草坪梁上蠕动着。这是文县境内的大山之一。汽车在这个山上盘过来绕过去，经过二十多个盘道。当车子行驶到最高的地方，站起来看看同行的几辆客车，眼睛不禁迷恍起来。车子正在
  向前走，忽然又像沿着山沟向后面驶去；原来跑在我们后面的车辆，一时又仿佛跑到我们的前面去了。这真是一个奇观。
    文县县城快到啦。主人似乎有意让我们对这条路有个轮廓性的了解，带着作总结的口吻告诉我们说：
  “这条公路全长一百四十六公里，施工的时间很短，到1956年11月全路修通，前后不过用了八个月。这条路的修建经验告诉我们：在农业合作化以后，在武都这样的山大沟深的地方，也完全可能把地方道路修得四通八达。现在我们已经培养出一支强大的筑路队伍，近百个技术较好的民工，已经到刘家峡、镜铁山、白龙江等地去支援公路建设和河道炸修工程。
    在苍茫的暮色中，我们到达了“万山皆陡壁，一水不通舟”的文县。当第一批汽车开到这个小小的山城的时候，附近几十里路内的几千农民都赶来观看。他们高兴地抚摩着汽车的每一个部分，庆幸着土特产运不出去、工业品运不进来的历史的结束，迎接着即将发生的生产和生活中的重大变化。
