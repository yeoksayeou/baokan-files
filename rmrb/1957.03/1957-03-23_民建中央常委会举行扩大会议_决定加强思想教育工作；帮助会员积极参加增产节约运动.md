Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: The enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA) held tonight passed a resolution unanimously supporting the resolutions passed by the Third Plenary Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), and decided to strengthen the ideological education work of the CDNCA and help and encourage members to actively participate in the increase production and practice economy campaign.

The resolution stated that the CDNCA must unite with the people of the whole country, mobilize all members and the industrial and commercial masses they are connected with, and strive to implement the instructions of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou and the resolutions of the CPPCC.

The resolution stated that the Standing Committee of the Central Committee believes that strengthening the ideological education of members and helping and encouraging members to actively participate in the increase production and practice economy campaign should become the central work of the CDNCA.

Regarding ideological education, the resolution stated that since the implementation of joint state-private ownership of all trades, the relations of production of capitalist industry and commerce have undergone fundamental changes, and the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie has been basically resolved. However, the capitalist ownership of the means of production has not been finally eliminated, and the bourgeoisie still exists. Therefore, the class contradiction between workers and industrialists and businessmen still exists within the people today. Affirming the objective existence of this contradiction and handling it correctly will gradually resolve it, thereby consolidating our internal unity and further giving play to our positive role in socialist construction.

The resolution pointed out that the ideological education work in the future, in addition to continuously educating industrial and commercial members to correctly understand the nature, status, and role of their class today, should focus on helping them understand the history of the arduous struggle of the Chinese Communist Party leading the people of the whole country to achieve victory in the people's revolution, the great achievements since the founding of the country, the superiority of the socialist system in China, and the arduousness of building socialism; to understand the significance of lasting world peace for our country's peaceful construction, the role of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the ever-expanding international united front in defending world peace, and the responsibilities our country should shoulder in international affairs; to understand the great significance of the Chinese working class and its vanguard, the Chinese Communist Party's policy of peaceful transformation of the bourgeoisie—the redemption policy—and their attitude towards this policy and the necessity of further accepting transformation, to establish a sense of political responsibility, and to treat the work of the enterprises and other posts they participate in with the attitude of masters and a spirit of responsibility.

Regarding the increase production and practice economy issue, the resolution pointed out: Industrialists and businessmen have long-term experience in managing enterprises, and many industrialists and businessmen also have specialized technologies. Therefore, as long as they establish a sense of political responsibility, give play to their initiative and enthusiasm, and care about the needs of the country and the people, it is possible for them to contribute to the increase production and practice economy campaign, and some have already done so. Therefore, the CDNCA should help and encourage industrial and commercial members to achieve results in the increase production and practice economy work by actively working in enterprises, contributing talents, participating in socialist competitions, and improving state-private cooperative relations. Industrial and commercial members and non-industrial and commercial members who do not work in enterprises should also strive to increase production and practice economy in their respective work posts.

The meeting was presided over by Vice Chairman Li Zhuchen. The meeting also discussed issues such as the 1957 establishment of local organizations of the association, and the heads of the Tianjin, Shanghai, and Zhejiang CDNCA organizations reported on the situation of the transmission and discussion of the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the association.

    民建中央常委会举行扩大会议
　　决定加强思想教育工作；帮助会员积极参加增产节约运动
    新华社22日讯　今晚举行的中国民主建国会扩大的中央常务委员会会议通过了一项决议，一致拥护政协全国委员会第三次全体会议所通过的各项决议，并决定加强民主建国会的思想教育工作，帮助和鼓励会员积极参加增产节约运动。
    决议说，中国民主建国会一定要和全国人民一道，动员全体会员和所联系的工商界群众为贯彻毛主席、周总理的指示和政协的决议而奋斗。
    决议说，中央常务委员会认为加强会员的思想教育工作，帮助和鼓励会员积极参加增产节约运动，应当成为民主建国会的中心工作。
    关于思想教育工作，决议中说，自从全行业公私合营以后，资本主义工商业的生产关系已经发生根本变化，工人阶级与资产阶级的矛盾已经基本上解决，但是资本家的生产资料所有制还未最后消灭，资产阶级还存在，所以今天在人民内部还存在着工人同工商业家的阶级矛盾。肯定这个矛盾的客观存在，加以正确处理，就会使它逐步得到解决，从而巩固我们内部的团结，进一步发挥我们对于社会主义建设的积极作用。
    决议指出，今后的思想教育工作，除了不断地教育工商业者会员正确地认识自己阶级今天的性质、地位和作用外，应着重地帮助他们认识中国共产党领导全国人民取得人民革命胜利的艰苦奋斗的历史，建国以来的伟大成就，社会主义制度在中国所呈现的优越性，以及建设社会主义的艰巨性等；认识世界持久和平对于我们国家进行和平建设的意义，以苏联为中心的社会主义阵营和不断扩大的国际统一战线对保卫世界和平的作用，以及我们国家在国际事务上应尽的责任；认识中国工人阶级及其先锋队中国共产党对资产阶级的和平改造方针——赎买政策的重大意义，和自己对待这个政策的应有态度以及进一步接受改造的必要性，树立政治责任感，以主人翁的态度和对工作负责的精神对待自己所参加的企业工作和其他岗位工作。
    关于增产节约问题，决议指出：工商业家有长时期经营企业的经验，不少工商业家还有专门技术，因此，只要他们树立政治责任感，发挥主动积极性，关心国家的需要和人民的需要，他们是有可能在增产节约运动中作出贡献的，而且有的已经这样做了。因此，民主建国会应当帮助和鼓励工商业者会员通过在企业中积极工作，贡献才能，参加社会主义竞赛，搞好公私共事关系等行动来在增产节约工作中做出成绩。不在企业中工作的工商业者与非工商业者会员也应在自己的工作岗位上努力增产节约。
    这次会议是由副主任委员李烛尘主持的。会议还讨论了该会地方组织1957年编制等问题，天津、上海和浙江民建会组织的负责人汇报了关于该会二中全会决议传达讨论的情况。
