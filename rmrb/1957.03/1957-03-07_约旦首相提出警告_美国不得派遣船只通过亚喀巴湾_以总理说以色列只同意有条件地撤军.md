    Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: Amman Dispatch: Jordanian Prime Minister Nabulsi said on March 6th that Arabs believe that no country has the right to send ships through the Gulf of Aqaba without the consent of the Arabs.
    In an interview with a United Press International reporter, Nabulsi said that any attempt to send ships flying the American flag through the Gulf of Aqaba to Israel's port of Eilat would be considered "an attitude of hostility on the part of the United States."
    Nabulsi said: "The Gulf of Aqaba should not be open to all ships, otherwise it would mean rewarding Israel for aggression."
    Referring to the Eisenhower Doctrine on the Middle East, Nabulsi said: "I see no communist threat here." He said: "I do not believe that there is the kind of threat in Syria and Egypt that propagandists say there is."
    Nabulsi also said that "any plan to maintain peace in the Middle East should be implemented through the United Nations, and such a plan should be applicable to dealing with any aggression."
    Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: Jerusalem (Israeli-controlled area) Dispatch: Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion asked the Knesset on the evening of March 5th to endorse the government's decision to withdraw Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip and Sharm el-Sheikh on the west coast of the Gulf of Aqaba. He asked the Knesset for a vote of confidence.
    In a ninety-minute speech, Ben-Gurion said that Israel had in fact received moral guarantees for its withdrawal. He said that Israel only agreed to withdraw under the following conditions:
    1. The Gulf of Aqaba must be open to Israeli ships; to maintain this right, Israel may again use force to pass through the Gulf.
    2. Egypt must never be allowed to return to the Gaza Strip.
    He said that the government's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Sharm el-Sheikh was in the hope of avoiding UN sanctions. If sanctions were imposed, it would prevent certain countries from maintaining "freedom of navigation" in the Gulf of Aqaba. He said that, in that case, some countries would also be unable to supply Israel with the equipment it needed for self-defense.
    His speech was repeatedly interrupted by shouts from opponents of the withdrawal. Some questioned him: "Is this victory?" "Why are you deceiving us?"
    Ben-Gurion's statement in the Knesset was repeatedly postponed in order to "persuade" the far right, which opposed the withdrawal. On this day, the Knesset meeting was delayed by several hours for the final "persuasion" work.
    However, the opponents of the withdrawal still organized a large-scale demonstration against Ben-Gurion in the Israeli-controlled area of Jerusalem on this day. Some people held signs demanding Ben-Gurion's resignation.
    The Israeli Knesset is scheduled to hold a vote of confidence on Ben-Gurion's withdrawal decision on March 6th.

    约旦首相提出警告
    美国不得派遣船只通过亚喀巴湾
    以总理说以色列只同意有条件地撤军
    新华社6日讯　安曼消息：约旦首相纳布西6日说，阿拉伯人认为，没有阿拉伯人的同意，任何国家都无权派遣船只通过亚喀巴湾。
    纳布西在接见合众社记者时说，使挂着美国旗帜的船只通过亚喀巴湾到以色列的埃拉特港去的任何企图都将被认为是“美国方面的一种敌意态度”。
    纳布西说：“亚喀巴湾不应当向一切船只开放，否则就意味着给以色列以侵略的报酬。”
    纳布西在谈到关于中东的艾森豪威尔主义时说：“我看不出在这里有任何共产主义威胁。”他说：“我并不认为，在叙利亚和埃及有像宣传家所说的那种威胁。”
    纳布西还说，“保持中东和平的任何计划都应该通过联合国来执行，这种计划应该适用于对付任何侵略。”
    新华社6日讯　耶路撒冷以色列区消息：以色列总理本—古里安5日晚上要求议会赞同政府的从加沙地带和亚喀巴湾西海岸的沙姆沙伊赫撤出以色列军队的决定。他要求议会投信任票。
    本—古里安在历时九十分钟的发言中说，以色列事实上已经得到了对它的撤军所作的道义上的保证。他说，以色列只是在下面这些条件下才同意撤退的：
    一、亚喀巴湾必须向以色列船只开放；为了保持这种权利，以色列可能会再度使用强力通过海湾。
    二、决不允许埃及返回加沙地带。
    他说，政府撤出加沙地带和沙姆沙伊赫是为了希望避免联合国的制裁。要是实行制裁的话，就会使某些国家不能维护亚喀巴湾的“通航自由”。他说，那样一来，某些国家也就不能对以色列供应它进行自卫所需的装备。
    他的发言一再被撤军反对派的叫嚷声所打断。有的人质问他：“这就是胜利吗？”“你为什么欺骗我们？”
    本—古里安在议会发表这个声明之前，为了“说服”反对撤军的极右派，曾经一再延期。就在这一天，为了进行最后的“说服”工作，又把议会开会时间延迟了几小时。
    但是撤军反对派在这一天仍然在耶路撒冷以色列区组织了大规模的反对本—古里安的示威游行。有些人拿着要求本—古里安辞职的标语牌。
    以色列议会预定在6日对本—古里安的撤军决定投信任票。
