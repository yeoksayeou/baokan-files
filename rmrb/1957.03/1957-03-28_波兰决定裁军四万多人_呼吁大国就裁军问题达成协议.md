　　Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 27th: According to a report by the Polish Press Agency on March 27th, the government of the Polish People's Republic decided at a meeting on March 25th to further reduce the Polish armed forces by 44,500 people.
　　This decision stems from the hope of making a new contribution by the Polish people to the cause of disarmament and the development of peaceful relations between all peoples, and in the expectation of obtaining more resources for developing the national economy.
　　At the same time, the government also passed decisions on the employment of demobilized officers and ensuring that they receive appropriate material living conditions.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 27th: According to a report by the Polish Press Agency on March 27th, a Polish government spokesman issued a statement saying that the Polish government's decision, announced today, to further reduce the armed forces by 44,500 personnel is a significant political decision. We have hoped in the past and continue to hope for international understanding and for the creation of conditions that would make universal disarmament possible. Although these necessary conditions have not yet been realized, Poland has already reduced its armed forces twice within a period of less than one year, for a total of 97,000 people. Thus, the current reduction is the third reduction carried out in a short period of time. In the long run, it will contribute to our efforts to improve the living standards of our people.
　　The Polish government made this decision at a time when the Disarmament Subcommittee is meeting in London. Our decision is an appeal to the major powers, urging them to push the disarmament issue further and reach an agreement. The new proposals put forward by the Soviet Union in this regard have already provided a basis for reaching an agreement.
　　We are very clear that while Poland is reducing its armed forces, many countries continue to expand their armaments, and West Germany is being remilitarized. Therefore, Poland's unilateral reduction of armed forces and armaments cannot endanger Poland's interests. The Warsaw Treaty remains our guarantee, and the existence of this treaty is inseparable from the establishment and strengthening of NATO forces. The Polish government must constantly care about our country's defense and security.

　　波兰决定裁军四万多人
　　呼吁大国就裁军问题达成协议
　  据新华社华沙27日电　据波兰通讯社27日报道，波兰人民共和国政府在3月25日会议上决定把波兰的武装部队再裁减四万四千五百人。
    这个决定的出发点是希望使波兰人民对裁军事业和发展各国人民之间的和平关系作出新的贡献，并期望取得更多资源发展国民经济。
    同时，政府还通过了关于退伍军官就业和保证使他们得到适当的物质生活条件的决定。
    新华社华沙27日电　据波兰通讯社27日报道，波兰政府发言人发表声明说，波兰政府今天宣布的把武装部队进一步裁减四万四千五百名的决定是一项重大的政治决定。我们在过去和现在都希望国际间求得谅解，希望创造出使普遍裁军成为可能的条件。尽管这种必要条件还没有实现，但是波兰已经在不到一年的期间内两次裁减它的武装部队共九万七千人。这样，目前的裁减就是在短短的时期内所进行的第三次裁减。从长远来看，它将有助于我们为提高人民的生活水平而进行的努力。
    波兰政府正当裁军小组委员会在伦敦开会的时候作出了这个决定。我们的决定是对各大国的呼吁，要求它们应当把裁军问题推进一步，它们应当达成协议。苏联在这方面提出的新建议已经提供了达成协议的基础。
    我们十分清楚，正当波兰裁减武装部队的时候，有许多国家继续扩充军备，西德正在重新军国主义化。因此，波兰单方面裁减武装部队和军备，不能够使波兰的利益遭到危害。华沙条约仍然是我们的保障，这个条约的存在是同北大西洋公约组织部队的建立和加强分不开的。波兰政府必须经常关心我国的国防和安全。
