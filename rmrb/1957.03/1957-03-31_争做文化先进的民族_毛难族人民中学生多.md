Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 30th. The Maonan people, who live in the mountains of Huanjiang County, Guangxi Province, now have seventeen people out of every hundred in universities, middle schools or primary schools. Their cultural level is higher than that of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas of the province.

Huanjiang County has a total of 18,000 Maonan people, mainly living in thirteen stone mountain townships and semi-stone mountain townships. It is the only Maonan ethnic group settlement in China. The region has thirty-five primary schools with more than 3,000 children enrolled, accounting for 90% of school-age children. The number of Maonan students studying in provincial junior middle schools has increased six-fold compared with the time of liberation in 1949. In recent years, ninety Maonan students graduating from this school have been admitted to high schools and universities. In all townships where Maonan people live, the teachers in the schools are generally intellectuals of their own nationality, and they use their own language for teaching. In addition to schools, evening classes have also been established in various townships and counties in Huanjiang. Last year, 80 to 90 percent of the young and middle-aged people in Zhongnan Township participated in literacy classes.

Now, the accountants and recorders of the agricultural cooperatives in the Maonan area are all Maonan graduates from higher primary schools and junior middle schools, and many members can read.

　　争做文化先进的民族
　　毛难族人民中学生多
    新华社南宁30日电  聚居在广西省环江县大山中的毛难族人民，现在每一百人中就有十七个人在大学、中学或小学读书，文化水平比全省山区各族人民都高。
    环江县共有毛难族一万八千人，主要居住在十三个石山乡和半石山乡，是我国唯一的毛难族聚居区。全区现有小学三十五所，入学儿童三千多人，占适龄儿童的90％。在省初级中学读书的毛难族学生，现在比1949年刚解放时增加了六倍。这个学校毕业的毛难族学生，几年来已经有九十人考入高中和大学。凡是毛难族聚居的乡，学校里的教师一般是本民族的知识分子，并采用本民族语言教学。除了学校以外，环江各乡县还成立夜学班。中南乡去年有百分之八、九十的青壮年都参加了扫盲学习。
    现在，毛难族地区农业社的会计、记分员都是毛难族的高小和初中毕业生，许多社员都认识字。
