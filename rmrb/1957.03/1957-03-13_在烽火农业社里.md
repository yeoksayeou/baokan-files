In the Beacon Fire Agricultural Cooperative

Xue Mu

On February 12th, when Wang Baojing set off for Beijing to attend the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference, an old white-haired man chased after him breathlessly, shouting, "Baojing! Baojing! Wait a moment!" When he caught up, he hurriedly handed Wang Baojing a letter, repeatedly urging, "Please deliver this letter to Chairman Mao. Thanks to his blessing, I, who has no labor power, am living very well in the advanced cooperative."

This old man is named Wang Dacheng and is a "Five Guarantees Household" in the Liquan County Beacon Fire Agricultural Cooperative. Like all poor peasants, he turned his life around after liberation, and thanks to the good labor of his son, Wang Zhengying, his life improved day by day. In the winter of 1955, Wang Dacheng's family renovated their house. Suddenly, a large tree being used as a roof beam fell on his son Zhengying. In the blink of an eye, a strong young man became disabled, and sorrow replaced the family's joy. "People with labor power earn more income when they join the advanced cooperative; but for people like us with no labor power, joining the cooperative is a dead end." Old man Wang Dacheng was so tormented by this problem that he couldn't eat or sleep. The cooperative members assessed him as a "Five Guarantees Household," but he was still worried. After the cooperative's year-end settlement last year, Wang Dacheng counted on his fingers. Not counting the more than one hundred yuan his family spent from the cooperative, the cooperative provided a total of more than 3,300 jin of grain, averaging more than 820 jin per person for his family of four. When Wang Dacheng and his family were all wearing new cotton clothes, sitting on the warm kang in their new house, eating white noodles, how could they not be grateful for the warmth of the agricultural cooperative family! When old man Wang Dacheng heard that cooperative director Wang Baojing was going to Beijing for a meeting, he asked people everywhere to write a letter to Chairman Mao, expressing what he wanted to say in his heart.

Old man Wang Dacheng's letter expressed the sentiments of more than 110 households in the Beacon Fire Cooperative. Last year, the cooperative's total grain output reached more than 830,000 jin, transforming it from a grain-deficient cooperative to a surplus cooperative, delivering public grain to the state, selling surplus grain, and transferring improved seeds to fraternal cooperatives, totaling 250,000 jin. All the cooperative members increased their income.

I visited more than ten poor and lower-middle peasant households. Their incomes were the highest in the cooperative, increasing by one to three times compared to before joining the cooperative. One evening not long ago, under the guidance of cooperative cadres, we arrived at the home of poor peasant Wang Jinfu. Jinfu and his old wife were sitting opposite each other, the daughter-in-law in a floral cotton jacket sitting close to her mother-in-law, and the grandson, less than half a year old, lying in a warm floral quilt. The son was sitting under the lamp reading a newspaper. Our entrance disrupted the quiet life of this five-member family. The old couple got up to offer us seats, and the son picked up the thermos to pour us water. After a flurry of activity, our conversation began. Last year, their family received more than one hundred yuan in cash and more than 4,000 jin of grain. In the Beacon Fire Agricultural Cooperative, all poor peasant cooperative members are living like Wang Jinfu. On their kang, we could see stacks of three new floral quilts. In the past, poor peasant cooperative members were all debtors of the credit cooperative, but now they have become creditors with more than 2,000 yuan.

In this agricultural cooperative, not only have the poor peasant cooperative members increased their income, but also the upper-middle peasants and rich peasants have increased their income. The cooperative accountant, flipping through the ledger, told us that rich peasant Wang Fengyou, like other rich peasants, used to live a life where "the poor could not be killed, and the rich could not be enriched." After the village established the cooperative, the general standard of living for the poor peasants caught up with his, forcing him to join the cooperative last year. Under the supervision and transformation of the cooperative members, eight members of his family worked in the fields, earning more work points and receiving more shares. This rich peasant family, with more than twenty members, received a total of 18,000 jin of grain last year, and another 460 yuan in cash, an increase of 37% compared to before joining the cooperative.

In the advanced cooperative, the relationships between people have also begun to change. Cooperative members told me a heart-stirring story: One night last September, young cooperative member Wang Zhenji suddenly woke up from a dream: "Oh dear! Mom! My stomach hurts." The pain became more and more severe. He rolled from one end of the kang to the other, and later couldn't even move. The cooperative invited three or four doctors of both Western and traditional Chinese medicine, but Zhenji's condition continued to worsen. Young cooperative members spontaneously organized a stretcher team and rushed Zhenji away. The First People's Hospital of Xianyang County diagnosed him with "intestinal perforation." After the operation, he needed a lot of blood transfusions. Cooperative members Wang Zhenying, Wang Zhengying, and others rushed to extend their arms, saying, "Take mine," "Take mine." Zhenji had a second operation and needed another blood transfusion, so another group of cooperative members went. When more than a thousand cc of blood flowed together with Zhenji's blood, Wang Zhenji was out of danger. At the same time that Zhenji fell ill, Zhenji's wife was about to give birth. The cooperative members automatically helped his family carry water and firewood. Soon, Zhenji's illness improved, and the baby was born safely. In addition to taking care of Zhenji's medical expenses of 400 yuan, the cooperative allocated Zhenji's family so much grain that they couldn't finish it in a year. Zhenji's mother happily called this "three blessings at the door": first, Zhenji's life was saved by the cooperative; second, the good life was given by the cooperative; and third, a baby was born. They named the baby "Kao She" (Rely on the Cooperative).

Everything about the Beacon Fire Agricultural Cooperative makes people happy and encouraged. I, along with Zhao Jin Feng, Director of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture, and Su Xianzhong, Associate Professor of the Northwest Agricultural College, visited the cooperative's laboratory and experimental fields. The laboratory was littered with specimens of various experiments: cotton successfully grown on wheat stubble, large corn cobs hybridized with red heart white horse tooth corn as the parent and Liaodong white corn as the copy, and various wheat hybridization experiments, etc. Cooperative director Wang Baojing and technology section chief Ma Shuxiu told us about them with great interest, while demonstrating the asexual hybridization of cut embryo grafting… Technician Wang Jianyuan also led us to visit 106 ridges of comparative experiments on various crops and diverse farming practices. We all felt that this was not like an agricultural cooperative, but a real agricultural scientific research department. From here, everyone found the correct answer to the Beacon Fire Cooperative's consecutive years of bumper harvests; and also saw the conditions for striving for an even greater harvest this year. The cooperative members of the Beacon Fire Cooperative all understand the importance of learning technology, and many people have participated in spare-time technical schools. Wang Shutian, a cooperative member in his sixties, learns from his son in his spare time in order to master new technologies. Zhang Huixia, a newly married bride, also asked her husband to teach her technology. Learning new technologies has become a trend in the cooperative.

In the past year, people across the country have been very concerned about the Beacon Fire Agricultural Cooperative. More than a thousand letters have been sent from all over the country, some sending photos, some sending seeds, and some even sending bumper harvest experiences. It is precisely these kind concerns and enthusiastic support that enabled the Beacon Fire Cooperative to achieve a great harvest last year. What about this year? This is something that people across the country are even more concerned about. Cooperative member Wang Zuoxian compiled a clapper rhyme: "... In 1957, not complacent, we must strive for a bigger harvest, grasping fertilizer and water is the key, and soil and water conservation must not be neglected. Outside the South Gate is wasteland, we must change its original appearance, plant various fruit trees into gardens, and fill the cliffs with elm and ailanthus trees, and evergreens like pine and cypress will last for thousands of years..." It can be seen that the cooperative members of the Beacon Fire Cooperative are full of confidence in striving for a great harvest this year. The production increase plan has been formulated after repeated discussions by the cooperative members, and a spring production upsurge has been launched in the cooperative. Every day at the second crow of the rooster, the manure carts rumble. All the wheat is growing well, the first topdressing has already been applied, and the second is about to begin. Some dryland wheat cannot be irrigated, so they decided to draw water up step by step or carry water to irrigate the wheat.

    在烽火农业社里
    学穆
    2月12日，王保京起程到北京参加全国农业劳动模范代表会议的时候，一个白发老人上气不接下气地追着他喊：“保京！保京！你等一等！”到了跟前，他急忙把一封信交给保京，再三叮咛：“你把这封信捎给毛主席。托他老人家的福，我这个没有劳力的人在高级社里生活得很好。”
    这个老人叫王大成，是醴泉县烽火农业社的“五保户”。他和所有的贫农一样是在解放以后翻身的，靠着儿子王正英的好劳动，日子一天天好起来了。1955年冬，王大成家翻修房子，忽然，一根做檩的大树倒在儿子正英身上，眨眼工夫，一个精壮小伙子成了残废，悲哀也就代替了这个家庭的欢乐。“人家有劳力，入了高级社收入多；咱这没劳力的人，入社也只有死路一条了。”王大成老汉为这个问题熬煎得吃不下饭，睡不好觉。社员们把他评成“五保户”，他还是耽心。去年社里年终决算以后，王大成手搬指头算了一下，他家先后用去社里一百多元不算，社里共给了三千三百多斤粮食，全家四口人每人平均八百二十多斤。当王大成一家子全身穿着新棉衣、坐在新房内热炕上，吃着白面条的时候，怎么能不感激农业社大家庭的温暖！王大成老汉听说社主任王保京要去北京开会，便四出托人给毛主席写信，表达自己心里要说的话。
    王大成老汉的信，表达了烽火社一百一十多户社员的心意。这个社去年粮食总产量达到八十三万多斤，由缺粮社变为余粮社，向国家交纳公粮、出售余粮和调剂给兄弟社的良种共达二十五万斤。全社的社员都增加了收入。
    我访问了十多户贫农和下中农。他们的收入是全社最高的，比入社前增加一倍到三倍。不久前的一个晚上，我们在社干部的引导下，到了贫农王金福家。金福和他的老伴对面坐着，和婆婆紧靠一起的是穿着花棉袄的儿媳妇，不到半岁的小孙孙，躺在温暖的花被里，儿子坐在灯下看报。我们一进去，就把这个五口之家的安静生活搅乱了。老俩口起来给我们让坐，儿子拿起热水瓶给我们倒水，一阵忙乱之后，我们的谈话就开始了。他们家去年分了一百多元钱，还分了四千多斤粮食。在烽火农业社里，所有贫农社员都过着像王金福这样的日子。在他们家的炕上，我们可以看到成叠的三面新的花被子。过去贫农社员全是信用合作社的债户，而现在却变成二千多元的债主了。
    在这个农业社里，不仅贫农社员都增加了收入，上中农和富农也都增加了收入。社会计翻着账本对我们说，富农王凤游和其他富农一样，过去是做着“杀不了穷汉，富不了富汉”的生活。村里建了社之后，一般贫农生活都赶上了他，形势逼着他在去年也入了社。在社员们的监督和改造下，他家有八个人下地干活，挣的劳动日多，分的也多。这家富农有二十多口人，去年共分到粮食一万八千斤、另外还分到四百六十元的现金，比他入社前增加37％。
    在高级社里，人与人的关系也开始了新的变化。社员们告诉我这样一件动人心弦的故事：去年9月的一个夜里，青年社员王振吉突然从梦中醒来：“唉呀！妈呀！我肚子疼。”疼痛愈来愈厉害，他从炕这头滚到炕那头，后来连动也动不了。社里请来了三、四个中西医，振吉的病还是有增无减。青年社员自动组织成担架队，飞也似的把振吉抬走了。经咸阳县第一人民医院诊断：是“肠穿孔”。动手术后，需要输很多血。社员王振英、王正盈等抢着伸出臂膀说：“抽我的”、“抽我的”。振吉二次开刀，又要输血，社里又去了一批社员。当一千多西西血和振吉的血溶流在一起时，王振吉就转危为安。就在振吉得病的同时，振吉的爱人快生娃了。社员们自动帮助他家担水、运柴。不久，振吉的病好了，小宝宝也平安出世了。社里除了照顾振吉医疗费四百元不算，分给振吉家的粮食一年还吃不完。振吉的母亲高兴地把这叫做“三喜临门”：一喜振吉的命是社里救活的；二喜好日子是社里给的；三喜添了个小宝宝。他们就给小宝宝取名叫“靠社”。
    烽火农业社的样样事情，都使人高兴，使人鼓舞。我和陕西省农业厅长赵锦峰同志，西北农学院副教授苏献忠等一起参观了社的试验室和试验田。试验室里横七竖八地堆放着各种试验的标本：有试验成功的麦茬地棉花，有用红心白马牙玉米作木本和辽东白玉米作副本杂交的大棒子，各种小麦的杂交试验等。社主任王保京、技术股长马书秀一边津津有味地给我们讲着，一边把无性杂交的切胚嫁接方法做给我们看……。技术员王建元又带领我们参观一百零六畦的各种作物、多样作务的对比试验田。我们都感觉这好像不是一个农业社，而是一个真正的农业科学研究部门。从这里，大家对烽火社连年丰产，找到了正确答案；也看到了争取今年更大丰收的条件。烽火社的社员都懂得学习技术的重要，许多人参加了业余技术学校。六十多岁的社员王书田，为了掌握新技术，他有空就向儿子学习。刚结婚的新媳妇张惠霞，也叫丈夫教她技术。学习新技术在社里已经形成风气。
    在过去的一年中，全国人民都很关心烽火农业社。从各地寄来的信件有一千多封，有的寄来照片，寄来种子，有的还寄来丰产经验。正是这些亲切的关怀和热情的支援，烽火社在去年获得了大丰收。今年怎么样呢？这更是全国人民关心的事情。社员王作贤编了一段快板：“……五七年，不自满，更要争取大丰产，抓肥、抓水是关键，水土保持莫怠慢。南门外，是荒坡，要它改变原面目，各种果树要成园，榆树椿树长满崖，松柏长青万万年……”可以看出：烽火社的社员们对争取今年大丰收满怀信心。增产计划经过社员反复讨论已经订出来了，春季生产高潮又在社内掀起来了。每天鸡叫二遍，拉粪的车就呼噜噜地响起来了。全部小麦生长很好，第一次追肥已经上了，二次即将开始。有些旱地小麦不能灌水，他们决定把水逐级引上去或者担水浇麦。
