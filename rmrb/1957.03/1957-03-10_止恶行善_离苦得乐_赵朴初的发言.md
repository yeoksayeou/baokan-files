Stop Evil and Do Good, Escape Suffering and Attain Happiness
Zhao Puchu's Speech

Please allow me, as a Buddhist, to express my heartfelt joy and support for Chairman Zhou Enlai's report on his visit to eleven Asian and European countries. I also express my utmost admiration and gratitude for Chairman Zhou's selfless diligence, outstanding talent, and great achievements during this arduous journey of over 54,000 kilometers.

Today, our country's entire work is aimed at:
Gradually Realizing a "Pure Land on Earth"
The main teaching of Buddhism is to enable all sentient beings to stop evil, do good, escape suffering, and attain happiness. To achieve this goal, Buddha taught his followers to "do what is difficult to do, give what is difficult to give, endure what is difficult to endure, and learn what is difficult to learn," embracing the fearless spirit of "If I don't go to hell, who will?" and "tirelessly" "provide for all beings." Buddhists often view our country through their own lens. We believe that all of our country's work today is work to "stop evil, do good, escape suffering, and attain happiness." Therefore, we applaud our country's efforts and achievements in opposing wars of aggression and safeguarding world peace; we applaud our country's efforts and achievements in eliminating exploitation and poverty and building socialism; we applaud our country's efforts and achievements in cultural construction and social morality construction; we applaud our country's efforts and achievements in safeguarding the people's cause and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. All these efforts and achievements, in the eyes of Buddhists, are precisely the gradual realization of a "Pure Land on Earth." Last year, when the head of the International Buddhist Monks Delegation, Venerable Ananda, reported his impressions to the Indian people, he said: "Some say China is a paradise, and some call China hell. I say, China is a country that is moving from hell towards paradise, and for many countries today, it is already paradise."

Chinese Buddhists feel honored and happy to be born in this era and in this country. Only here and now can we be at peace and work practically on what we should do. Buddhists across the country are actively participating in the struggle against nuclear weapons and against aggression. The slogan we have put forward is: Safeguarding peace is the greatest Buddhist practice. We also enthusiastically participate in socialist construction and socialist transformation. Many labor models have emerged in agriculture and forestry. In the former Rehe area, there was a model case of a monk who afforested five barren mountains. In the 1954 flood prevention and disaster relief work in Wuhan, several temples won red flag awards, and seven monks, nuns, and lay Buddhists were awarded the title of meritorious person. We earnestly mobilized the masses to expose and eliminate counter-revolutionaries hidden within Buddhism, to protect the security of the motherland and the people, and to maintain the purity of religion. Chinese Buddhists have never had such an opportunity as today to work together with all the people on such a large-scale work of "stopping evil, doing good, escaping suffering, and attaining happiness." We cannot express our joy and gratitude enough, thanking our leaders—the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Government, Chairman Mao, Chairman Liu, Premier Zhou, and other national leaders. The four "difficulties" and four "abilities," the "fearless spirit," and the "tireless provision for all beings" of Buddhism, these great images that have always been held as ideals, are now concretely and vividly embodied in them! Their wisdom has activated the wisdom of 600 million people, and their strength has activated the strength of 600 million people. The wisdom and strength of 600 million people are creating miracles on this land with each passing day.

Not long ago, a Buddhist publication published a poem:

Once upon a time, there was a night,
Shakyamuni sat under the Bodhi tree,
He subdued the demon army, he attained great liberation,
In an instant, immense light appeared,
Shaking the heavenly palace, shaking the earth,
Buddha spoke for the first time the truth he had realized:
"How wondrous are sentient beings, their strength and wisdom,
Are so inconceivable."
*　*　*
This story enlightened me,
My heart is increasingly amazed,
It seems to be narrating today's facts,
These facts are happening in our country,
We subdued the demon army,
Overthrew imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism;
We attained great liberation,
The Chinese people stood up,
The bright sun rose in the East.
*　*　*
Have we not done earth-shattering things in the past seven years?
Every month, every year, in every corner of every place,
Miracles are constantly emerging.
The railway passes through the clouds of the Qinling Mountains,
Cars gallop on the roof of the world,
Industrial bases are rising in the Gobi Desert,
The Yellow River is about to begin supplying electricity,
It will no longer recklessly carry away sand and mud,
It will increasingly obediently follow the will of the people.
*　*　*
A magnificent picture unfolds in the countryside:
A hundredfold confidence, a hundredfold courage,
Surge in the climax of cooperation,
The National Agricultural Development Program is opening up a happy land,
The twelve years of effort of 500 million farmers,
Will eradicate backwardness and poverty in history.
We will see "rows of precious trees,"
We will see "golden ground,"
We will see the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss established in the human world.
*　*　*
The city is also full of joy:
Gongs and drums are deafening, bidding farewell to capitalism,
Children encourage their fathers, wives encourage their husbands,
Capitalists congratulate themselves.
Such an elimination of exploitation, such an elimination of classes,
Is unprecedented in history?
One upsurge after another,
Handicraft workers also join arms and rise up,
Collectivization means developing infinite potential.
*　*　*
The advanced producer movement is sweeping the country,
Workers are creating advanced examples one after another,
Breaking outdated quotas, innovating outdated technologies,
Constantly pushing our industry to new heights.
Intellectuals are preparing for twelve years of effort,
To popularize the glory of culture,
To align the level of science with the world's advanced
Overwhelmingly and joyfully,
The people of the whole country are running towards socialism.
*　*　*
Socialism is the prosperity of the motherland,
Socialism is the happiness of the people,
Socialism is world peace and justice.
That is why for its victory,
Six hundred million people dedicate their hearts and minds together.
The great era makes the great language become a reality, and reality shows magic,
"How wondrous are sentient beings, their strength and wisdom,
Are so inconceivable."
This is a passionate song of Buddhists for the motherland and the people.
"Our life, our wisdom, our
Strength is a drop of water, as long as we are willing to put it
In the people's sea, this drop of water will last
Never dry up."
Fellow members, I have two purposes in speaking this today. First, I hope that everyone will understand the feelings of the new Chinese Buddhists, and hope that everyone knows that here we have many positive factors, many useful strengths that can be mobilized and should be mobilized to serve the construction of the motherland and to serve world peace. I hope everyone will pay attention to this fact and give more help and encouragement, and don't ignore it. We thank the government for its great efforts in implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief over the past few years. However, there are still instances of violating religious policies and hindering religious life in various places, and individual incidents are quite serious. I believe that implementing freedom of religious belief is not only the responsibility of the government's religious affairs department, but everyone's responsibility. Freedom of religious belief is stipulated in the Constitution and listed as a special clause, and everyone has the obligation to abide by it. Every article of the Constitution is not isolated, but serves socialism. Implementing it is beneficial to the cause of socialism, and vice versa. Religious policy, like all policies, can only prevent the occurrence of policy violations or be corrected in a timely manner with everyone's attention and correct understanding. In particular, matters of the spiritual world cannot be dealt with by crude methods. Chairman Mao's instructions on the religious issue in his report at the Eleventh Supreme State Conference should be the compass for all people to treat religion.

Second, I would like to take this opportunity to call on Buddhists across the country to love our country and abide by the country's constitution, not only based on our obligations, but also based on our beliefs, and to further unite with the people of the country and actively participate in the country's socialist construction and the movement to safeguard world peace. Our historical experience and our teachings tell us that the interests of Buddhism must be combined with the interests of the people. One day, Shakyamuni Buddha asked his disciples: "What should be done to make a drop of water never dry up?" The disciples could not answer. The Buddha said: "Put it in the sea." Our life, our wisdom, and our strength are a drop of water. As long as we are willing to put it in the people's sea, this drop of water will never dry up. (Attached picture)

### 止恶行善　离苦得乐  赵朴初的发言

专栏：

    止恶行善　离苦得乐
    赵朴初的发言
    请允许我以一个佛教徒的身份，对周恩来主席关于访问亚欧十一国的报告，表示衷心的欢喜和拥护，并对周主席在这次五万四千多公里的辛苦旅行中所表现的忘我的勤劳和卓越的才能，和所取得的伟大的功绩，表示无比的敬佩和感谢。
    今天我们国家全部的工作正是为的
  逐步实现“人间净土”
    佛教的教义，主要是要令所有众生止恶行善、离苦得乐。为要达到这个目的，佛陀教他的信徒们应当“难行能行、难舍能舍、难忍能忍、难学能学”，抱着“我不入地狱，谁入地狱”的大无畏精神，“无有疲厌”地“为众生供给使”。佛教徒往往是以自己的眼光来看我们的国家的。我们认为今天我们国家的全部工作都是“止恶行善、离苦得乐”的工作。因此我们赞叹我们国家在反对侵略战争、保卫世界和平事业上所做的努力和取得的成就；我们赞叹我们国家在消灭剥削和贫困、建设社会主义的事业上所作的努力和取得的成就；我们赞叹我们国家在文化建设和社会道德建设上所作的努力和取得的成就；我们赞叹我们国家在保卫人民事业、肃清反革命分子运动中所作的努力和取得的成就——这一切的努力和成就，在佛教徒看来，正是“人间净土”的逐步实现。去年到我国来访问的国际佛教僧侣代表团团长阿难陀法师向印度人民报道他的感想时，他说：“有人说中国是天堂，也有人把中国说成地狱，我说，中国是这么一个国家，它从地狱走向着天堂，而且对今天的许多国家说来，它已经就是天堂。”
    中国佛教徒因为生在这个时代和这个国家里而感到光荣和幸福。在此时此地，我们才能够心安理得地而且脚踏实地地做我们应当做的事。全国佛教徒都积极参加着反对核子武器、反对侵略的斗争，我们提出的口号是：保卫和平是最大的佛事。我们也热情参加着社会主义建设和社会主义改造，在农业林业中涌现了不少的劳动模范，原热河地区就有一个僧人绿化了五座荒山的模范事例；1954年武汉防汛救灾工作中，有好几个寺院获得了红旗奖，有七位僧尼居士获得了功臣的称号。我们认真地发动群众，揭发和清除隐藏在佛教内部的反革命分子，为了保卫祖国和人民的安全，也为了维护宗教的纯洁。中国佛教徒从来没有过像今天这样的机会，能够和全体人民一起进行这样伟大规模的“止恶行善、离苦得乐”的工作。我们无法说出我们的欢喜和感谢，感谢我们的领导者——中国共产党、人民政府、毛主席、刘委员长、周总理和其他各位国家领导人。佛教徒所谓四“难”四“能”，“大无畏精神”，“无有疲厌为众生供给使”，这些一向被悬为理想的伟大形象，现在不正是具体地活生生地体现在他们的身上吗？他们的智慧发动了六万万人的智慧，他们的力刃发动了六万万人的力刃，六万万人的智慧和力刃在这个国土上正在日新月异地创造着奇迹。
    不久之前，佛教刊物上登载过这样一首诗：
    曾经有过这么一个夜里，
    菩提树下坐着释迦牟尼，
    他摧服了魔军，他得到了大解脱，
    刹那间极大的光明现起，
    摇晃着天宫，震动了大地，
    佛陀第一次说出了自己证悟的真理：
    “奇哉啊众生，他们的力刃和智慧
    原来是这样的不可思议。”
              *　*　*
    这个故事使我获得了启示，
    我心中越来越感到惊奇，
    它好像是叙述着今天的事实，
    这事实正发生在我们的国家里，
    我们摧服了魔军，
    打倒了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义；
    我们得到了大解脱，
    中国人民站立了起来，
    光明的太阳在东方升起。
                *　*　*
    七年来我们做的，难道不是惊天动地？
    每月，每年，每个地方的角落里，
    都不断涌现着奇迹。
    铁路通过了秦岭的云层，
    汽车奔驰在世界的屋脊，
    戈壁兴起着工业基地，
    黄河就要开始供给电力，
    它将不再卤莽地带走沙泥，
    它将越来越宛转地随人之意。
                *　*　*
    壮丽的图景展开在农村里：
    千百倍信心，千百倍勇气，
    在合作的高潮中涌起，
    农业发展纲要开辟着幸福的天地，
    五万万农民十二年的努力，
    将使落后和贫困在历史上绝迹。
    我们将看到“宝树成行”，
    我们将看到“黄金为地”，
    我们将看到极乐国土在人间建立。
                  *　*　*
    城市里也是重重喜气：
    锣鼓喧天，送走了资本主义，
    子女们鼓励着父亲，妻子们劝勉着丈夫，
    资本家们庆贺着自己。
    这样地消灭剥削，这样地消灭阶级，
    岂不是史无前例？
    一个高潮接着一个高潮，
    手工业者也连臂而起，
    合作化意味着开发无穷的潜力。
                  *　*　*
    先进生产者运动在全国掀起，
    工人们纷纷创造着先进的范例，
    打破陈旧的定额，革新陈旧的技术，
    把我们的工业不断推向新的高级。
    知识分子们准备着十二年的努力，
    要使文化的光辉普及，
    要使科学水平向世界先进的看齐
    排山倒海地和欢天喜地地，
    全国人民奔向社会主义。
                  *　*　*
    社会主义就是祖国的繁荣，
    社会主义就是人民的幸福，
    社会主义就是世界的和平与正义。
    这就是为什么为着它的胜利，
    六万万人一齐献出心力。
    伟大的时代使伟大的语言变成现实，而现实显出着神奇，
    “奇哉啊众生，他们的力刃和智慧，
    原来是这样的不可思议。
    这是佛教徒对祖国和人民的热情的歌唱。
      “我们的生命，我们的智慧，我们
  的力量是一滴水，只要我们肯把它放
  在人民的大海去的话，这一滴水是永
  远不会干的。”
    各位委员，我今天讲这一段话有两个用意。第一是希望大家认识新中国佛教徒的心情，希望大家知道，在我们这里是有许许多多的积极因素，有许许多多的有用的力刃可以动员而且应当动员起来为祖国建设服务，为世界和平服务的。希望大家注意这个事实，多多给予帮助和策励，千万不要忽视它。我们感谢政府几年来对于宗教信仰自由政策的贯彻作了重大的努力。但是各地违反宗教政策、妨碍宗教生活的情事，还是存在的，而且个别事件相当严重。我认为贯彻宗教信仰自由不只是政府宗教事务部门的事，而是大家的事。宗教信仰自由规定在宪法里而且列为专条，大家都有遵守的义务。宪法的每一个条文都不是孤立的，都是为社会主义服务的。贯彻它，就对社会主义事业有利，反之就不利。宗教政策像一切政策一样，只有在大家注意和正确理解之下，违反政策的情事才不至发生或者可以及时得到纠正。特别是精神世界的事，不可以用粗暴方法来对付。毛主席在第十一次最高国务会议上所做的报告中关于宗教问题的指示，应该是全体人民对待宗教的指南针。
    第二是我想借这个机会号召全国佛教徒，我们应当不仅根据我们的义务，而且根据我们的信仰，热爱我们的国家，遵守国家的宪法，更进一步和全国人民团结在一起，积极参加祖国的社会主义建设和保卫世界和平运动。我们的历史经验和我们的教义都告诉我们，佛教的利益必须与人民的利益结合起来。有一天，释迦牟尼佛问弟子：“如果要使一滴水永远不干，应当怎么办？”弟子回答不出。佛说：“放在大海里去。”我们的生命，我们的智慧，我们的力量是一滴水，只要我们肯把它放在人民的大海去的话，这一滴水是永远不会干的。（附图片）
