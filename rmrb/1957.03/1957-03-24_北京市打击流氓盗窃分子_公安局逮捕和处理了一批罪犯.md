　　Beijing Cracks Down on Hooligan Thieves
　　Public Security Bureau Arrests and Deals with a Group of Criminals

    This newspaper reports that recently the Beijing Public Security Bureau punished a group of hooligans and thieves, and placed some young people with serious hooligan and theft behavior into custody for reform through labor.

    These hooligans and thieves often operate in areas such as the Quan Ye Chang, Qianmen Railway Station, and Tianqiao Market, especially in Quan Ye Chang, where they steal goods and customer property when crowds are dense. Sometimes they gather in groups of more than ten to fight, throwing cigarette butts and spitting at female sales clerks and customers from the third floor of Quan Ye Chang, making trouble for no reason. Some even use various hooligan tactics to insult female sales clerks and some young girls. Mei Shichang, a hooligan thief who used to be a puppet soldier, even tricked a female student from a middle school to the vicinity of Longtan and attempted to rape her. The hooligan thief Zheng Zhicheng not only engaged in criminal activities himself but also instigated more than a dozen young people to engage in hooliganism and theft, handing over the stolen goods to him for squandering. These hooligans also stole materials from construction sites, sabotaging various construction projects. In October of last year, they cut off more than 30 meters of high-voltage wire erected on the Xuanwumen city wall, and stole some important parts from a large machine at a construction site in Xidan, rendering the machine inoperable, endangering the socialist construction of the capital. More seriously, under the enticement and corruption of these hooligan thieves, some young people have gradually turned bad. One fourteen-year-old elementary school student, who had previously received academic excellence awards, began engaging in hooliganism and theft after being enticed and corrupted by them. The leaders of this group of thieves and hooligans are mainly some bad elements who had been sentenced to imprisonment and have not repented after serving their sentences, such as Mei Shichang and Zheng Zhicheng. Mei Shichang was sentenced to two years in prison in 1952 for theft and indecent assault.

    After discovering these circumstances, the Beijing Public Security Bureau conducted a special investigation. The masses are also extremely resentful of these hooligans and thieves. Relevant government departments and newspapers have received many reports from the public, and some activists have even turned in hooligan thieves to public security departments for handling. Victims have constantly demanded that these hooligans and thieves be severely punished. Based on the investigation materials and the opinions and reports from the public, the Beijing Public Security Bureau began to arrest some hooligans and thieves with serious crimes according to the law, starting in October of last year. As of February 3 this year, Mei Shichang, Zheng Zhicheng, Liu Dianyu, Yan Tuzi, Liu Qingcheng, Ma Junliang, Su Laifu, Wang Xinru, and others have been arrested. In the past month, some young people with serious hooligan and theft behavior have been taken into custody in two separate groups for reform through labor. Some young people with lighter offenses have been handed over to their parents to be taken home for discipline.

    After adopting the above measures, the situation has improved. However, in order to further consolidate the social order of the capital, the Beijing public security organs will take more forceful measures and fully mobilize the masses to severely crack down on hooligan thieves.

　　北京市打击流氓盗窃分子
　　公安局逮捕和处理了一批罪犯
    本报讯　最近北京市公安局惩办了一批流氓、盗窃分子，收容教养了一些有严重流氓、盗窃行为的少年。
    这些流氓、盗窃分子，经常在市内劝业场、前门车站、天桥市场等地区，特别是在劝业场，乘顾客拥挤的时候，偷窃商品和顾客财物，有时集中十几人打群架，从劝业场三楼往下对准女售货员和顾客扔烟头、吐痰，无理取闹。有的还用各种流氓手段侮辱女售货员和一些年幼的女孩子。伪军出身的流氓、盗窃分子梅世昌甚至把某中学的一位女学生骗到龙潭附近企图强奸。流氓、盗窃分子郑志成，不仅自己从事犯罪活动，还唆使十几个少年进行流氓、盗窃活动，偷了财物就交给他挥霍。这些流氓还偷盗建筑工地的材料，破坏各种建设。去年10月，宣武门城墙上架设的高压线被他们割去三十多公尺，西单一工地上的大型机器，被他们偷去一些重要的零件，致使机器不能开动，危害了首都的社会主义建设。更严重的是在这些流氓盗窃分子的引诱腐蚀下，有的青少年也逐渐变坏了。有一个十四岁的小学生，过去曾得过学业优良奖状，经他们的引诱腐蚀，开始了流氓、盗窃活动。这群窃盗、流氓中为首的主要是一些曾经被判过徒刑、在刑满释放后仍不悔改的坏分子，如梅世昌、郑志成等。梅世昌在1952年的时候，就因为进行盗窃和调戏妇女等罪行被判处徒刑二年。
    北京市公安局发现这些情况后，即专门进行了调查。群众对这些流氓、盗窃分子也是极为愤恨的，政府有关部门和报社曾经收到不少群众的检举材料，有的群众积极分子还扭送流氓盗窃分子到治安部门处理，受迫害者更不断要求对这些流氓、盗窃分子严加惩办。北京市公安局根据调查材料以及群众的意见和检举，从去年10月开始，陆续依法逮捕了一些罪行严重的流氓、盗窃分子。到今年2月3日为止逮捕了梅世昌、郑志成、刘殿玉、颜秃子、刘清成、马骏良、苏来福、王欣如等。在过去一个月中，对一些有严重流氓、盗窃行为的少年，曾分作两批将他们分别收容进行教养。对一些情节较轻的少年交给他们家长领回管教。
    在采用了上述措施以后，情况已有好转。但为了进一步巩固首都的社会治安，北京公安机关将采取更有力的措施，并充分发动群众，严厉地打击流氓盗窃分子。
