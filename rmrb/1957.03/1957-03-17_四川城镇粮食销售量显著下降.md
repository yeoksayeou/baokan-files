　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 15th. After strengthening education on grain conservation for residents and rectifying grain supply work, Sichuan Province has seen a significant decline in grain sales in towns throughout the province. According to statistics from the Sichuan Provincial Grain Bureau, grain sales in February decreased by more than 830,000 jin per day on average compared to January, a decrease of about 10%. The amount of grain used by people of all strata has generally decreased by half a jin to one jin per person per month, and the amount of grain used by the catering industry and other industries has also decreased by about 15%.
　　Since the second half of last year, there has been a tendency towards laxity in the grain supply work in Sichuan Province's towns, with inappropriately increased subsidies for grain for residents and a large increase in grain for the catering and other industries, resulting in a monthly increase in grain sales of about 10 million jin. Since the province launched the campaign to increase production and practice thrift, people in various places have paid attention to saving grain and have returned surplus grain coupons and stored grain or used them to offset their own supplied grain. Residents and public grain-using units in Chengdu alone turned in more than 700,000 jin of stored grain and grain coupons. At the same time, grain departments in various places have rectified the grain supply work in towns, verified the urban population and labor situation, and ensured that the supply is reasonable. The supply of grain to the catering and other industries has also been compressed, under the principle of guaranteeing local normal needs, to reduce inappropriate supply levels.

    四川城镇粮食销售量显著下降
    新华社成都15日电　四川省在对居民加强节约粮食的教育和整顿粮食供应工作后，全省城镇粮食销售量显著下降。据四川省粮食厅统计，2月份粮食销售量比1月份平均每天减少八十三万多斤，约下降10％左右。各阶层人民的用粮量一般每人每月减少半斤至一斤，饮食业及其他行业用粮也减少了15％左右。
    去年下半年以来，四川省城镇粮食供应工作有偏松现象，对居民不适当地普遍增加了补助粮，对饮食等行业用粮增加很多，以致城镇粮食销售量月月上升，每月约增加一千万斤左右。自从全省开展增产节约运动以后，各地人民都注意了节约粮食，并纷纷把剩余粮票和存粮交回或抵算自己的供应粮。仅成都市居民和公共用粮单位缴回的存粮和粮票就有七十多万斤。同时，各地粮食部门对城镇粮食供应工作进行了整顿，并对城镇人口和劳动情况进行了核定，作到供应合理。对饮食等行业的用粮，也在保证当地正常需要的原则下，将供应得不适当的部分作了压缩。
