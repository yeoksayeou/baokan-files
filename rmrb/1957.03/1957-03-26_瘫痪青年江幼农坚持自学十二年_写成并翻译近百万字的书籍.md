Xinhua News Agency, March 24th, by Xinhua News Agency reporter Bu Zhaowen: A young man named Jiang Younong, paralyzed for twelve years, has persisted in self-study while bedridden. He has now become a person with research in agricultural science and nutrition. Relying on two fingers that can barely move, he has written and translated nearly one million words of books.

　　When Jiang Younong works every day, he needs to prop his head up with several pillows to slightly raise his upper body. Others help him place his right arm on a specially made small table in front of his chest, and the two movable fingers then hold the pen to start writing. When the reporter visited him, he was concentrating on rewriting his own book, "Scientific Data on Asexual Hybridization of Plants." He told the reporter that this book was almost rewritten, and it would be several times larger than the original. This is the second book he has written after his book "Nutritional Essays."

　　This young man told the visiting guests that he had suffered from severe rheumatoid arthritis since he was twelve years old. After being bedridden, he persisted in studying and writing while enduring pain all the time. He first completed the basic courses of middle school, and then extensively read books on agricultural science, nutrition, and related chemistry. Later, with the help of a teacher, he learned Russian in four months and translated articles from Soviet agricultural science magazines. Last year, he translated "Grassland Crop Rotation System" by Soviet scholars Maksimov et al., which has already been published. This book contains more than 320,000 words.

　　This twenty-four-year-old youth lives in the Xisi District of Beijing and comes from a retired university professor's family. He began self-study because he was motivated by an interest in learning and a desire to improve. After liberation, he received the education of the Party, and especially after reading the book "How the Steel Was Tempered," he understood the meaning of life and was determined to do his best to strive for membership in the Youth League with practical actions of serving the people. After joining the Youth League in 1956, he obtained the help and education of the organization, which made his goals clearer.

　　His bedroom is a library, with hundreds of books on agriculture and nutrition, and nearly thirty kinds of professional magazines are subscribed to. Agricultural experts from the North China Agricultural Science Institute are also very concerned about him, often lending him books and revising his manuscripts. The Youth League organization he belongs to also often comes to visit him, caring about his life and health.

　　瘫痪青年江幼农坚持自学十二年
　　写成并翻译近百万字的书籍
    据新华社24日讯　新华社记者卜昭文报道：一位全身瘫痪的青年江幼农躺在床上十二年坚持自学，现在成为在农业科学和营养学方面有研究的人，他依靠两个仅仅能动的手指头，写成并翻译了近一百万字的书籍。
    江幼农每天工作的时候，需要用几个枕头垫着头，使他的上身微微抬起，别人帮助他把右臂搁在他胸前特制的小桌上面，两个能动的手指便夹着钢笔开始写作。记者去访问他时，他正在专心一意地改写他自己写的“关于植物无性杂交的科学资料”一书。他对记者说，这本书已经快改写完了，比原书增加好几倍。这是他继“营养小品”一书之后写作的第二本书。
    这位年青人告诉来访的客人说，他从十二岁就患着严重的类风湿性关节炎，躺在床上后无时不在忍受疼痛中坚持学习和写作。他首先学完了中等学校的基础课，以后又博览了农业科学、营养学和同这些方面有关的化学等书籍，后来他又在一个教师的帮助下，用四个月的时间学会俄文并翻译苏联农业科学杂志上的文章。去年他翻译了苏联马克西莫夫等著的“草田轮作制”，并且已经出版，这本书有三十二万多字。
    这位二十四岁的青年，家住北京市西四区，出身在一个退休的大学教授家里，开始自学时是因为对学习有兴趣和上进心的促使。解放以后接受了党的教育，特别看了“钢铁是怎样炼成的”一书后，知道了人生的意义，决心尽自己的力量，用为人民服务的实际行动争取入团，1956年参加了青年团后，他便获得了组织的帮助和教育，使得自己的奋斗目标更明确了。
    他的卧室就是一个图书馆，有关农业、营养学方面的书籍不下数百册，还订了专业杂志近三十种。华北农业科学研究所的农学专家们对他也非常关怀，常借书给他看，并给他修改稿件。他所在的团组织也常来看望他，关心他的生活和身体健康。
