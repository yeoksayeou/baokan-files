    Actively Solve the Problems of Piglet and Feed Shortages
    Henan's Pork Production Will Increase by 66% Compared to Last Year
    Wangcheng County Plans to Raise 530,000 Pigs This Year
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou - Henan Province has formulated its pig-raising plan for this year. By the end of the year, the number of pigs in stock in the province will reach 6 million, an increase of more than 66% compared to the number of pigs in stock at the end of last year.

    In order to solve the problem of piglet shortages and ensure the completion of the pig-raising plan, the Zhengyang and Zhongmu breeding pig farms under the Henan Provincial Department of Agriculture are now being expanded. The provincial agricultural leading department has also decided to transform forty county farms with suitable conditions into local piglet breeding farms, and invest state funds to support the establishment of mating stations in thirty county farms and seventy-five key agricultural cooperatives. In Xiangcheng, Neixiang and other high-quality breeding pig producing areas, breeding areas have been designated. All localities have put forward the requirement of "every township has breeding pigs, every team has sows", and it is planned that by the end of March, the number of sows in the province will increase from the existing 400,000 to 700,000. All piglet breeding farms and mating stations will also widely promote the advanced experience of "double mating" and "re-mating" to increase the reproduction rate of piglets.

    At present, farms and agricultural cooperatives in various places are trying every means to solve the problem of pig feed. Farmers in mountainous areas are planning to plant oak trees, maple trees, etc. on the hillsides, preparing to use these tree seeds as concentrated feed for pigs. In the sandy areas of eastern Henan and along the Yellow River, they are preparing to make full use of saline-alkali land to grow Jerusalem artichokes, lamb's quarters, purslane and other plants that pigs love to eat. The Huainan rice area plans to vigorously propagate aquatic plants that can be used as pig feed in ponds, riverbanks, and low-lying and watery areas after the spring.

    In addition, various localities will strengthen the prevention and control of pig diseases this year.

    This newspaper reports that Wangcheng County in Hunan, a famous pig-producing area, plans to raise 530,000 pigs this year, an increase of 33.1% compared to last year, with an average of more than five pigs per household. This plan was determined at the county-wide production meeting in mid-February after heated discussions among all township and commune cadres.

    In order to complete this year's pig development plan, the meeting discussed five measures: breeding piglets, carrying out breeding pig selection and identification; relying on the masses to be self-reliant, making full use of green feed and wild vegetables to enrich feed sources; special personnel to lead, special personnel to be responsible, strengthen management, implement cost-fixed output, record work according to output, and reward for overproduction; strengthen epidemic prevention and treatment work, and promote the "white pigsty" movement. In order to strengthen leadership, the county has set up a special agency, which is specially managed by a member of the county party committee. (Kuang Luan)

    积极解决仔猪和饲料缺乏问题
    河南生猪产量将比去年增加66％
    望城县今年计划养猪五十三万头
    据新华社郑州电  河南省已经订出今年的养猪计划。到年底全省存栏猪数将达六百万头，比去年年终存栏猪数增加66％以上。
    为了解决猪仔缺乏问题，保证完成养猪计划，河南省农业厅所属的正阳、中牟两个种猪场，现在已在进行扩建。省农业领导部门还决定把四十个有条件的县农场，改变为地方仔猪繁殖场，并在三十个县农场和七十五个重点农业社中，由国家投资扶持建立配种站。在项城、内乡等优良种猪产地，已划定了良种繁殖区。各地都提出了“乡乡有种猪，队队有母猪”的要求，计划到3月底全省母猪数量要由现有的四十万头增加到七十万头。各仔猪繁殖场、配种站还将普遍推广“双重交配”、“复配”的先进经验，以增加仔猪的繁殖率。
    现在，各地农场、农业社正想尽一切办法，解决猪饲料问题。山区农民正计划在山坡上种植橡树、枫树等，准备用这些树籽作喂猪的精料。豫东沙区和黄河沿岸地区，准备充分利用盐碱地种猪爱吃的洋姜、灰灰菜、马氏菜等。淮南水稻区计划开春后在池边、河边、砦沟等低凹有水处，大量繁殖可作猪饲料的水生植物。
    此外，今年各地还将加强猪疫病的防治工作。
    本报讯  著名的生猪产地湖南望城县，计划今年养猪五十三万头。比去年增加33.1％，平均每户养五头多。这个计划是在2月中旬的全县生产会议上，经过全体乡社干部热烈讨论后确定下来的。
    为了完成今年生猪发展计划，会议讨论了五项措施：繁殖仔猪，进行种猪精选鉴定；依靠群众自力更生，充分利用青饲料和野菜，丰富饲料来源；专人领导，专人负责，加强经营管理，推行定成本定产量，按产记工，超产奖励的办法；加强防疫治疗工作，推行“白猪栏”运动。为了加强领导，县设专门机构，由一个县委委员专管。	（邝麓安）
