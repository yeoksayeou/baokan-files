Xinhua News Agency, March 12th: TASS reported on the 11th that Budapest newspapers published the "Outline for Commemorating the 109th Anniversary of the 1848-1849 Hungarian Bourgeois Revolution and the Struggle for National Independence," jointly issued by the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the Patriotic People's Front, the Central Council of Trade Unions, the Central Council of Women, the Revolutionary League of Working Youth, the National Union of Young Students, the Federation of University Students, the Unified Farmers' Youth League, and the Hungarian Freedom Fighters Association.

The outline recounts the historical facts of the 1848 Hungarian bourgeois revolution and the struggle for national independence being defeated by the superior forces of international reactionary forces, and the subsequent struggle of the Hungarian Communists, who held high the banner of the 1848 revolution, to fight for the freedom and national independence of the people and against the Horthy counter-revolutionary regime.

The outline addresses the mistakes made by the former national leaders of Hungary and analyzes the counter-revolutionary rebellion of 1956. It points out that the enemies of the people's democratic system launched an armed attack on the Hungarian people's democratic system on October 23rd of last year, attempting to overthrow the people's government and restore capitalism. However, they shamelessly used the anti-feudal revolutionary slogans of 1848 as the pirate's flag to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat. The counter-revolutionaries insisted that they were fighting for "freedom" and against dictatorship. And the task we face is precisely to further strengthen the dictatorship of the working class under the leadership of the Party. While expanding the people's freedom, this dictatorship will resolutely and ruthlessly strike at counter-revolutionary forces in order to defend the people's freedom. In doing so, the Hungarian Communists are consistent with the spirit of the heroes of the 1848 liberation struggle.

The outline reveals in detail the essence of the Nagy government's actions during the October events and emphasizes the significance of the Soviet army's assistance to the Hungarian people in defending the achievements of socialism. The outline states that Soviet assistance was and remains the most important guarantee of our national independence.

The outline concludes by saying that in the present era, only a socialist Hungary that has formed a fraternal alliance with socialist countries can be an independent Hungary. We failed in 1849, but today we will surely achieve victory.

    匈牙利政府、党和群众团体联合发表
    纪念一八四八年革命提纲
    强调在党的领导下加强无产阶级专政
    据新华社12日讯　据塔斯社11日报道：布达佩斯报纸刊载了匈牙利工农革命政府、匈牙利社会主义工人党、爱国人民阵线、工会中央理事会、妇女中央理事会、劳动青年革命联盟、全国青年学生联盟、大学生联合会、统一农民青年联盟和匈牙利自由战士协会联合发表的纪念1848—1849年匈牙利资产阶级革命和民族独立斗争一百零九周年的提纲。
    提纲叙述了1848年的匈牙利资产阶级革命和民族独立斗争在国际反动势力的优势力量下遭受失败和以后匈牙利共产党人高举1848年革命的旗帜为争取人民的自由和民族独立、反对霍尔蒂反革命制度而斗争的史实。
    提纲谈到了匈牙利前国家领导所犯的错误，分析了1956年的反革命叛乱。它指出，人民民主制度的敌人从去年10月23日起对匈牙利人民民主制度发动了武装进攻，企图推翻人民政权和恢复资本主义。但是，他们无耻地利用1848年反封建的革命口号作为海盗的旗帜，来反对无产阶级专政。反革命分子硬说他们是为争取“自由”、反对专政而战。而我们面临的任务恰恰在于，在党的领导下进一步加强工人阶级专政。这个专政在扩大人民自由的同时，正是为了保卫人民的自由而坚决无情地打击反革命势力。匈牙利共产党人这样作是同1848年解放斗争中英雄们的精神一致的。
    提纲详细揭露了十月事件过程中纳吉政府行动的实质，强调指明了苏军帮助匈牙利人民保卫社会主义成果的意义。提纲说，苏联的帮助过去是、现在仍然是我们民族独立的最重要的保证。
    提纲最后说，在现时代，只有同社会主义国家结成兄弟同盟的社会主义的匈牙利才能是独立的匈牙利。1849年我们失败了，今天我们必将取得胜利。
