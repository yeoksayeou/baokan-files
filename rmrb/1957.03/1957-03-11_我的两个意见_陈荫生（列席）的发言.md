My Two Opinions
Chen Yinsheng (Observer) Speaks

Since liberation, I have participated in the work of the CPPCC in Kunming. Under the leadership of the Party, although I have been working and learning simultaneously, I have always felt that my ideological and political level is not commensurate with my job position. Therefore, I have often wished to participate in a meeting in Beijing to improve my ideological understanding.

This time, I came to Beijing to attend the plenary session of the National Committee of the CPPCC as an observer. I listened to Chairman Mao's instructions, Premier Zhou's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC. I fully endorse all of them. My thoughts on the future work of the CPPCC have received the greatest and best education of my life.

First, it clarified that the contradictions among the people are mainly resolved through ideological understanding, that is, starting from unity, reaching new unity through criticism.

In terms of work direction and methods, it clarified the path China is taking for industrialization during the transition period, the principle of overall planning, appropriate arrangements in the economic field, and the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, so that when I return to the CPPCC in Kunming, I can further put forward opinions and conduct liaison and consultation with all parties.

Under the call of long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, and letting a hundred flowers bloom, we must unite all possible forces, give full play to the positive role of the united front, and strive to build our country into a prosperous and strong socialist country.

Now I would like to raise two opinions, hoping that the National Committee of the CPPCC and the government will consider them.

1. The National Committee of the CPPCC should establish a regular inspection system for local CPPCCs.

National construction is developing very rapidly, and new situations and problems arise at any time in the work. Among the members of the united front, there are different perspectives on looking at problems. Therefore, under different opinions, there will be fear of making conservative mistakes and fear of making rash advances. Due to insufficient understanding of the policies, when faced with different opinions, a dilemma of agreement and disagreement will appear, which will bring some losses to the work. Therefore, it is necessary for the National Committee of the CPPCC to provide regular guidance to local CPPCCs.

Around 1953, Comrade Zhou Xinmin, a member of the National Committee of the CPPCC, came to Kunming for an inspection, which greatly promoted the work of the local CPPCC. At the end of 1956, representatives of the National People's Congress and members of the CPPCC also came to Kunming for an inspection, but the time was too short, and the inspection of the CPPCC work was only a part of the entire inspection content. Due to time constraints, the local CPPCC could not get sufficient instructions.

Therefore, it is requested that the National Committee of the CPPCC establish a regular inspection system for local CPPCCs, hoping for once a year. After the establishment of this inspection system, it is expected to achieve three goals and requirements: (1) guide the work; (2) exchange national work experience; (3) be able to reflect opinions and solve problems in a timely manner. This is the first opinion I want to say.

2. The leadership issue of pharmaceutical companies and medicinal materials companies.

Kunming's pharmaceutical companies and medicinal materials companies are on the supply side for serving the people's health, and hospitals and joint clinics are on the consumption side for serving the people's health. Disconnection often occurs on the supply side. Therefore, doctors and the people have a lot of opinions on the insufficient supply of medical equipment and Chinese and Western medicines from pharmaceutical companies and medicinal materials companies.

The Kunming Municipal CPPCC once invited the responsible comrades of both the supply and sales parties to hold a symposium, but it was still difficult to reach a consensus, and most of them were opposing each other's difficulties.

In fact, there are many shortages of drug varieties, so substitutes are used, which makes consumers dissatisfied, especially in the aspect of traditional Chinese medicine, there are more shortages of varieties. For example, the Kunming Red Cross Hospital is experimenting with a kind of Dali wine, which has special effects on ligament sprains, but because of the lack of *Eupolyphaga seu Steleophaga*, it cannot be prepared and supplied, so that this special effective medicine cannot serve the people's health, which cannot but be said to be a loss in health work.

In this situation, the Municipal CPPCC has continued to conduct liaison and understanding, and knows that the reason for the disconnection between supply and marketing is greatly related to the leadership issue. Pharmaceutical companies and medicinal materials companies are led by commercial departments, and hospitals and joint clinics are led by health departments. Therefore, there may be some differences in the perspectives of the commercial departments and health departments in organizing sources of goods, purchasing medicinal materials seasonally, storing medicinal materials, and mastering the amount of supply. However, the institutions led by the two departments are both serving the people's health, and this situation should be reflected to the government, and new consideration should be given to the leadership issue of pharmaceutical companies and medicinal materials companies.

I don't know if this situation exists only in Kunming City, or in other provinces and cities? In my experience, socialist construction requires people to have healthy bodies. Therefore, I put forward this opinion as a reference for the government. This is the second opinion I want to say.

Finally, I wish the conference success and everyone good health. (Attached picture)

### 我的两个意见  陈荫生（列席）的发言

    我的两个意见
    陈荫生（列席）的发言
    我自解放后，就参加在昆明市的政协工作，在党的领导下，虽是一面工作，一面学习，但自己始终感觉着在思想水平上和政治水平上均不能与工作岗位相适应。因此，常存有若能到北京参加一次会议，使思想认识得到提高的愿望。
    此次到北京列席政协全国委员会全体会议，听了毛主席的指示、周总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告、李富春副总理的报告以及政协第二届全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告，我都完全表示拥护。对于今后政协工作，在我的思想上受到自有生以来一次最大、最好的教育。
    首先明确了人民内部的矛盾，主要是从思想认识上来求得解决，就是从团结出发，通过批评，达到新的团结。
    在工作方向和方法上，明确了中国在过渡时期工业化所采取的道路和在经济方面统筹兼顾、适当安排，以及勤俭建国的方针等，使我今后回到昆明政协工作，能进一步的提出意见，与各方面进行联系和协商。
    在长期共存、互相监督和百家争鸣的号召下，团结一切可能团结的力量，发挥统一战线的积极作用，为将我国建成一个富强康乐的社会主义国家而努力。
    现在我提出两个意见，希望全国政协和政府给予考虑。
    ⒈全国政协对地方政协建立经常性的视察制度
    国家建设发展的很快，在工作上随时都有新的情况和问题发生，在统战成员中，看问题又各有不同的角度，因此，在不同的意见下，就会产生既怕犯保守的错误，又怕犯冒进的错误，由于对政策的体会不够而引起在面临着不同的意见时，会显现出同异两难的矛盾，这是会给工作带来一些损失的。因此，全国政协对地方政协有经常指导的必要。
    大约在1953年的时候，全国政协委员周新民同志到昆明视察过一次，对地方政协工作起到了很大的推动作用。1956年年底，全国人民代表和政协委员也到昆明视察过，但时间过短，并且对政协工作的视察只是整个视察内容中的一部分，为时间所限，地方政协未能充分的得到指示。
    因此，要求全国政协对地方政协建立经常性的视察制度，希望一年一次。这种视察制度建立后，可望达到三种目的和要求：（1）指导工作；（2）交流全国工作经验；（3）能及时反映意见和解决问题。这是我想说的第一个意见。
    ⒉医药公司和药材公司的领导问题
    昆明市的医药公司和药材公司是为人民健康服务的供应方面，各医院和联合诊所是为人民健康服务的消费方面。供应方面多发生脱节现象，因此，医生和人民对医药公司和药材公司的医疗器械和中西药的供应不够很有意见。
    昆明市政协曾邀请了供销两方的负责同志来开了座谈会，但意见仍难求得一致，多是对立的各说各的困难。
    在事实上，则是药品种类多有缺少，因而采用代用品，使消费者不满意，尤其是中药方面的品种缺的更多。例如昆明红十字会医院，实验一种大力酒，它对韧带扭伤具有特效，但因缺少土鳖，不能配制供应，使这种特效良药不能为人民健康服务，这就不能不说是卫生工作中的一个损失。
    此种情况，市政协曾继续进行联系和了解，知道供销会脱节的原因与领导问题有很大的关系。医药公司和药材公司是由商业部门领导，医院和联合诊所是由卫生部门领导，因此，有关组织货源、采购药材季节性和保管药材及掌握供应份量等，在商业部门和卫生部门的观点，在角度上是可能有些出入的。但两个部门所领导的机构，均是为人民健康服务的，应将此种情况反映给政府，对于医药公司和药材公司的领导问题，给予新的考虑。
    此种情况，不知是仅有昆明市存在，还是其他省、市也有？在我的体会，社会主义建设，需要人民有健康的身体，因此，提出这一个意见作为政府的一种参考。这是我想说的第二个意见。
    最后，祝大会成功和各位身体健康。（附图片）
