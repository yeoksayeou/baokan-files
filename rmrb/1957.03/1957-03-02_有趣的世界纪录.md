    Interesting World Records
    Staying on a Rope for Over Thirty Hours
    A seventeen-year-old French girl named Parry recently stayed on a rope more than ten meters above the ground for thirty-four hours and fifteen minutes continuously. This exceeds the previous endurance record for staying on a rope, set by Sweden's A. Lundberg last December, by eleven minutes.
    Parry is a circus performer. She stayed on the rope for such a long time that when she was hungry, circus personnel sent food up to her.
    Standing High Jump
    Norwegian athlete Jay Ivant recently cleared a horizontal bar of 1.73 meters in Stavanger without a running start. This is an informal new world record for the standing high jump.
    On the same day, Ivant also stood next to the sandpit and jumped 3.45 meters without a running start.
    Riding a Bicycle for More Than Six Days and Six Nights
    An athlete named Afsa Khan from Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, India, recently set a world record for bicycle endurance in New Delhi. According to reports, he rode continuously for a total of one hundred and fifty-seven hours and thirty-five minutes.
    Spending Over One Hundred and Seventy Hours in the Ground
    Reno Tanaka, known as the "Weirdo of Lodi," recently spent one hundred and seventy hours and six minutes in the ground, two meters deep, in a village near Milan, Italy. This is one hour and six minutes more than the record he set himself in February last year. He spent this time using the ascetic methods of yoga practitioners (rigorous meditative practices), and his only connection to the outside was a thin breathing tube.
    After coming out of the ground, he immediately ran to a tavern and ate a large plate of spaghetti.

    有趣的世界纪录
    在绳索上呆三十多小时
    一个只有十七岁的叫帕里的法国女孩最近在一根离地十多公尺高的绳索上连续地呆了三十四个小时又十五分钟。她比瑞典的阿·伦德柏格去年12月所创造的在绳索上停留的持久纪录多了十一分钟。
    帕里是马戏团的一个演员。她在绳索上停留的时间是这样长，肚子饿的时候是由马戏团的人把食物送上去给她吃的。
    立定跳高
    挪威运动员杰·伊凡特不久前在斯塔文格尔不用助跑就跳过了一点七三公尺的横竿。这是立定跳高的非正式世界新纪录。
    这一天，伊凡特还站在沙坑旁边，不用助跑跳了三点四五公尺远。
    在自行车上骑了六天六夜多
    印度北方邦巴累利地方一个叫阿弗萨·汉的运动员不久前在新德里创造了骑自行车持久的世界纪录。据消息说，他连续不断地一共骑了一百五十七小时三十五分钟。
    在地里过了一百七十多小时
    被称为“洛迪的怪人”的雷诺·坦卡最近在意大利米兰附近一个村子的两公尺深的地里过了一百七十小时又六分钟。这比他本人在去年2月创造的纪录还多了一小时六分钟。他是用瑜伽信徒的修行方法（刻苦的冥想的修行法）度过这些时间的，他同外面的唯一的联系是一根细长的呼吸用的管子。
    他从地里出来后马上跑到酒馆里吃了一大盘的细通心面。
