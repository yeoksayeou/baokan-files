Overcoming Shortcomings in the Training of Geological Personnel
Speech by Yin Zanxun

    First shortcoming: The allocation of production cadres and research cadres is unreasonable; Second shortcoming: One-sided emphasis on the importance of geological engineers, neglecting the training of geologists.

    A year ago, our Party issued the call to advance towards science, "striving to enable our country's most urgently needed scientific departments to approach advanced world levels by the end of the Third Five-Year Plan." There is no doubt that geology is one of China's most urgently needed scientific departments and should be rapidly developed as a priority.

    The main task of geology is to guarantee the underground resources needed for national construction. This task is accomplished in three ways: first, production work such as prospecting and exploration; second, geological scientific research work; and third, geological education work. In the more than seven years since the founding of the country, we have achieved varying degrees of success in these three areas. The greatest achievements have been in geological production work, the poorer achievements in geological research work, and geological education work has been half good and half neglected. This imbalanced development shows that there are still many shortcomings in our work. The first major shortcoming is that the allocation of production cadres and research cadres has become increasingly unreasonable. The second major shortcoming is that the importance of geological engineers is emphasized one-sidedly, while the training of geologists is neglected.

    After the teaching reform in 1952, geological cadres should be trained separately by comprehensive universities and higher industrial schools. Comprehensive university geology majors train "geologists," and higher industrial school geological exploration majors train "geological engineers." These two types of geological cadres each have their own strengths and weaknesses and neither can be neglected. However, since 1952, the training of geologists has been completely interrupted.

    Comprehensive university geology majors, which train geologists, focus on training in basic sciences (such as physics, chemistry, etc.) and basic geological sciences (such as mineralogy, petrology, paleontology, historical geology, structural geology, etc.), lacking or without training in geological exploration (such as mining geology, reserve calculation methods, etc.) and exploration engineering (such as drilling and tunneling). Comprehensive university geology graduates are geologists with an emphasis on theoretical cultivation. Their career paths are diverse. Geological science research institutions of the Academy of Sciences and research institutions related to geology need them. Most of the geology teachers in comprehensive university geology departments and related departments, geology teachers in higher industrial schools in many majors, and geology teachers in normal schools and secondary technical schools should be supplemented by them. Geological research institutions in industrial departments, field geological survey teams, and prospecting teams also need a certain number of geologists from comprehensive universities.

    In the geological exploration majors of higher industrial schools, which train geological engineers, the curriculum is more complex, with equal emphasis on basic sciences, basic technical sciences, basic geological sciences, geological exploration courses, and exploration engineering courses. The geological engineers who graduate are rich in production knowledge and skills in geological exploration and exploration engineering. They are production experts in industrial departments, so it is appropriate that the vast majority of young geological engineers who have just graduated go to work in industrial departments. In addition, a small number of geological engineers are also needed to teach geological exploration courses in higher industrial schools and secondary technical schools. It is undeniable that engineers must also conduct research, and that some of the older engineers who have accumulated rich experience through production practice will inevitably turn to scientific research and become geologists who focus on scientific research.

    After the reorganization of departments and colleges in 1952, the geology departments of the old universities underwent tremendous changes. Some (Peking University, Shandong University, Sun Yat-sen University, Guizhou University) were merged into higher industrial schools, some (Tsinghua University, Tianjin University, Tangshan Institute of Technology) were converted into higher industrial schools and completely transferred out their geological faculty, some (Chongqing University) were converted into higher industrial schools, retained their geological faculty, and trained two-year geological technicians, and some (Nanjing University, Northwest University), although transformed into comprehensive universities, trained two-year geological technicians of an engineering nature. From 1952, the old universities ceased to exist, and the task of comprehensive university geology departments to train young geologists was interrupted. The source of this type of geological personnel was completely cut off.

    In 1954, Nanjing University was the first to restore the comprehensive university geology major. Peking University and Northwest University also restored it in 1955 and 1956, respectively. However, each school enrolled only sixty to ninety students each time, which was too few, and graduation was too late, with the earliest graduating in 1959. From 1959 to 1961, there were only about three hundred comprehensive university geology graduates.

    As mentioned above, after the teaching reform in 1952, two types of geological cadres with different characteristics should be trained separately by comprehensive universities and higher industrial schools. However, from 1953 to 1958, during the entire First Five-Year Plan period and the early stages of the Second Five-Year Plan, not a single comprehensive university geology graduate was produced in the entire country. Only a little over three hundred people came out from 1959 to 1961. After a six-year interruption in the source, how can this number meet the urgent needs of many areas! This is a very serious problem.

    There are three geological exploration colleges that train geological engineers: Beijing, Changchun, and Chengdu, as well as Beijing Mining Institute, Beijing Petroleum Institute, Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, and Kunming Institute of Technology, graduating thousands of people each year. The training of geologists is concentrated in Peking University, Nanjing University, and Northwest University, with too few enrollment quotas. Nanjing University has a relatively strong geological faculty, but even with expanded enrollment, it feels insufficient. Northwest University is already feeling overwhelmed, and increasing its tasks would require increasing its strength. Peking University has only two professors in geology, and the rest are young teachers. The two majors, geology and geochemistry, offer more than ten geological courses. In the first two years, the two professors endured hardships and faced many difficulties. If the departments where geological talent is concentrated do not quickly find a way to provide support, the geology department of Peking University, which has an excellent tradition, will not be able to continue.

    Comparing the geology graduates of the old-style universities before the teaching reform with the geologists graduating from the new-style comprehensive universities, and then comparing them with the geological engineers trained by the new-style higher industrial schools, there is no doubt that they are very similar to the new-style geologists and very different from the new-style geological engineers.

    I do not have statistical figures and have not conducted any talent surveys. The numbers mentioned in my speech are only rough estimates. By the summer of 1952, there were approximately seven hundred graduates of the old-style university geology programs nationwide. Many people changed careers or died before liberation. About three hundred (?) people are now working in the geological system of the Ministry of Geology, about one hundred and fifty (?) are teaching, about sixty (?) are working in the Academy of Sciences, and dozens to a hundred people are working in other fields. Excluding the latter, the ratio of old-style university geology graduates in the Ministry of Geology, schools, and the Academy of Sciences is roughly 6:3:1.

    The geology graduates of the summer of 1953 studied a little exploration course, those who graduated in the summer of 1954 studied more, and those who graduated in the summer of 1955 studied even more. These three batches of geology graduates are products of the transitional period from the old-style universities to the new-style engineering education. From 1954, there were also a large number of two-year geological exploration specialized course graduates each year. Most of these people were assigned to industrial departments, and many of them have become the backbone of the production teams.

    The first batch of young geological engineers trained according to the new teaching plan emerged in the summer of 1956. Another batch will graduate in the summer of 1957. These thousands of geological exploration production experts will be capable cadres in industrial departments, especially the Ministry of Geology. After obtaining such cadres, and after the geological personnel who entered in the three years from 1953 to 1955 have begun to grow into experienced backbones, the Ministry of Geology will be able to transfer the majority of geologists from the old-style universities from production positions in batches over the next three or four years, starting from the second half of this year, in order to support geological science research institutions and higher education institutions lacking geological faculty.

    The Academy of Sciences should play its due role in geological science, but it is still very far from this requirement. Taking the Institute of Geology of the Academy of Sciences as an example, its strength is very weak, with only seventeen cadres above the level of associate researcher, including three who mainly do administrative work, four who teach part-time at schools, and one who works part-time at the Ministry of Geology. With such weak leadership, it is impossible to make valuable contributions to more than twenty geological sciences such as mineralogy, crystallography, petrology, sedimentology, metamorphic geology, paleontology, stratigraphy, dynamic geology, structural geology, geochemistry, radiogeology, aerial geology, petroleum geology, coal geology, metallogenic geology, non-metallic deposit geology, Quaternary geology, hydrogeology, engineering geology, neotectonics, soil mechanics, permafrost science, volcanology, etc. in eleven years. If this continues, geological science will become increasingly backward.

    The research institutions of industrial departments have their own characteristics, and the research institutions of the Academy of Sciences also have their own characteristics. Industrial departments have focused on production and neglected research in the past six years, and have begun to reverse this trend last year, but it is not enough. Simply strengthening the research institutions of industrial departments and neglecting the research institutions of the Academy of Sciences will also lead to bias, leading to the inability of practice to improve theory and the inability of theory to guide practice. The impact of this will not only make geological science backward, but also hinder production.

    There should be an appropriate allocation of forces in production, research, and education, and there should be an appropriate combination of long-term interests and current interests. Based on these two principles, I propose the following two suggestions.

    First, from the second half of 1957 to the second half of 1960, the Ministry of Geology should transfer the majority of geologists from the old-style universities from production positions in four batches to support geological research institutions of the Academy of Sciences, geological research institutions of the Ministry of Geology, and higher education institutions lacking faculty.

    Second, the Beijing Geological Exploration College and the Northeast Geological Exploration College should start enrolling comprehensive university geology major students this year, together with the comprehensive universities, enrolling 780 students each this year and next year, 870 students each in 1959 and 1960, and 960 students each in 1961 and 1962.

    My understanding of the relevant situation is insufficient, and the opinions I have put forward are inevitably inappropriate in many places. Please criticize and advise me, fellow committee members and comrades. (Attached picture)

    克服培养地质人材工作中的缺点
    尹赞勋的发言
    第一个缺点：生产干部和研究干部的配置不合理；第二个缺点：片面强调地质工程师的重要性，忽视了地质学家的培养。
    一年前，我们的党提出了向科学进军的号召，“争取在第三个五年计划期末使我国最急需的科学部门能够接近世界先进水平”。毫无疑问，地质学是我国最急需的科学部门之一，应该作为一个重点迅速地发展起来。
    地质学的主要任务是保证国家建设所需要的地下资源。这个任务从三方面来完成：一是普查勘探等生产工作，二是地质科学研究工作，三是地质教育工作。建国七年多来，我们在这三方面获得了不同程度的成就。地质生产工作成绩最大，地质研究工作成绩较差，地质教育工作一半好，一半未得到重视。这种不平衡的发展，显示着在我们的工作中还存在着不少的缺点。第一个较大的缺点在于生产干部和研究干部的配置变得越来越不合理了。第二个较大的缺点在于片面地强调地质工程师的重要性，忽视了地质学家的培养。
    1952年教学改革以后，地质干部应该分别由综合大学和高等工业学校来培养。综合大学地质类专业培养“地质学家”，高等工业学校地质勘探类专业培养“地质工程师”。这两类地质干部各有所长，各有所短，不可偏废。但是1952年以后，地质学家的培养完全中断了。
    培养地质学家的综合大学地质类专业，偏重基础科学（如物理、化学等）和基础地质科学（如矿物学、岩石学、古生物学、地史学、构造地质学等）的训练，缺乏或者没有地质勘探（如矿山地质学、储量计算法等）和勘探工程（如钻探和掘进）方面的训练。综合大学地质毕业生是偏重理论修养的地质学家。他们的出路是多方面的。科学院地质科学研究机构和与地质有关的研究机构需要他们。综合大学地质系和有关各系的地质教师、高等工业学校许多专业的地质教师、师范学校和中等技术学校的地质教师等，大多数应该由他们来补充。产业部门的地质研究机构、野外地质测量队和普查队也都需要一定数量的综合大学的地质学家。
    在培养地质工程师的高等工业学校地质勘探类专业中，课程比较复杂，基础科学、基础技术科学、基础地质科学、地质勘探课程、勘探工程课程等齐头并重。毕业出来的地质工程师富于地质勘探和勘探工程方面的生产知识和技能。他们是产业部门的生产能手，所以刚毕业的青年地质工程师绝大多数到产业部门去工作是适宜的。另外，高等工业学校和中等技术学校地质勘探方面的课程也需要少数的地质工程师去担任。不可否认，工程师也要进行研究，而且通过生产实践，积累丰富经验的较老工程师必然有一部分转向科学研究，成为以科学研究为主的地质学家。
    1952年院系调整后，各旧大学的地质系发生了巨大的变化。有的（北京大学、山东大学、中山大学、贵州大学）并入高等工业学校，有的（清华大学、天津大学、唐山工学院）改为高等工业学校而把地质师资完全调出，有的（重庆大学）改为高等工业学校，保留地质师资，培养二年制地质技术员，有的（南京大学、西北大学）虽变为综合大学而却培养工科性质二年制的地质技术员。从1952年起，旧大学不存在了，综合大学地质系培养青年地质学家的任务中断了。这一类地质人材的来源完全断绝了。
    1954年南京大学首先恢复了综合大学地质专业。1955年和1956年北京大学和西北大学也先后恢复了。不过各校每次招生六十—九十名，人数太少，而且毕业太晚，最早的也要到1959年才能毕业。1959、1960和1961三年综合大学地质毕业生大约不过三百多人。
    上边说过，1952年教学改革以后，两类性质不同的地质干部应该分别由综合大学和高等工业学校来培养。但是从1953年起到1958年止，整个第一个五年计划期间和第二个五年计划初期全国没有一个综合大学地质毕业生。1959到1961三年才出来三百多人。在来源中断六年之后，这个数字如何能满足许多方面的迫切需要呢！这是一个何等严重的问题。
    培养地质工程师的有北京、长春和成都三个地质勘探学院，还有北京矿业学院、北京石油学院、中南矿冶学院和昆明工学院，每年毕业数千人。地质学家的培养在北京大学、南京大学和西北大学三处，招生名额太少。南京大学地质师资较强，扩大招生，即感不足。西北大学现已有力不胜任之势，增加任务，也需要增加力量。北京大学地质方面只有两位教授，其余都是青年教师，所设地质学和地球化学两个专业有十几种地质课程。最初两年，两位教授艰苦支撑，困难重重。地质人才集中的部门如果不迅速设法支援，则具有优秀传统的北京大学地质系将无法继续办下去。
    拿教学改革以前旧型大学的地质毕业生和新型综合大学毕业的地质学家相比，再和新型高等工业学校培养的地质工程师相比，毫无疑问，他们和新型地质学家很相似，和新型地质工程师差别很大。
    我不掌握统计数字，也没有作过人材调查，发言中所说的人数只能是一些粗略的估计。到1952年夏为止，全国旧型大学地质毕业生大约有七百多人。解放前许多人改了行或者去世了。现在地质部系统工作的大约有三百（？）人，担任教学的大约有一百五十（？）人，在科学院工作的大约有六十（？）人，在其他方面工作的还有数十人到百把人。除后者不计外，旧型大学地质毕业生在地质部、学校和科学院三方面的人数比例大致为6∶3∶1。
    1953年夏地质毕业生学了一点勘探课程，1954年夏毕业的学得多一些，1955年夏毕业的更多一些。这三批地质毕业生是旧型大学转变为新型工科教育的过渡时期的产品。从1954年起每年另有大量的二年制地质勘探类专修科毕业生。这些人多数都分配到产业部门去了，其中许多都已成为生产队上的骨干。
    1956年夏按照新教学计划培养出来的第一批青年地质工程师出世了。1957年夏又要有一批毕业了。这两批数以千计的地质勘探生产能手，将是产业部门，首先是地质部的得力干部。地质部在获得这样的干部以后，在1953到1955三年中进来的地质人员已经开始成长为有经验的骨干以后，从今年下半年起，就有条件在最近三、四年内分批把大部分旧型大学出身的地质学家，从生产岗位上抽调出来，以支援地质科学研究机构和地质师资缺乏的高等学校。
    科学院在地质科学上应该发挥它应有的作用，但是现在距离这个要求还非常遥远。拿科学院地质研究所来说，力量非常薄弱，副研究员以上干部只有十七人，其中包括以行政工作为主的三人，在学校兼课的四人，在地质部兼职的一人。用这样薄弱的领导力量，要想在十一年内对于矿物学、结晶学、岩石学、沉积学、变质地质学、古生物学、地层学、动力地质学、构造地质学、地球化学、放射地质学、航空地质学、石油地质学、煤炭地质学、金属矿床学、非金属矿床学、第四纪地质学、水文地质学、工程地质学、新构造学、土质学、冻土学、火山学……等二十多门地质科学作出有价值的贡献，是不可能的。这样将就下去，地质科学一定要变为越来越落后的。
    产业部门的研究机构有它们自己的特点，科学院的研究机构也有它们自己的特点。产业部门前六年偏重生产，忽视研究，去年开始扭转，但还不够。单单加强产业部门的研究机构而忽视科学院的研究机构，也要发生偏向，导致实践不能提高理论，理论不能指导实践，影响所及，不但地质科学落后，生产也要受到阻碍。
    生产、研究、教育三方面的力量应有适当的配置，长远利益和当前利益应有适当的结合。根据这两个原则，提出以下两个建议。
    第一，从1957年下半年起，到1960年下半年止，地质部分四批把大多数旧大学出身的地质学家由生产岗位上调出来，以支援科学院地质研究机构，地质部地质研究机构和缺乏师资的高等学校。
    第二，北京地质勘探学院和东北地质勘探学院从今年起开始招收综合大学地质类专业学生，连同综合大学，今年和明年各招生七百八十名，1959和1960两年各招生八百七十名，1961和1962两年各招生九百六十名。
    我对于有关情况了解不够，所提意见难免有许多不妥当的地方，请各位委员、各位同志批评、指教。（附图片）
