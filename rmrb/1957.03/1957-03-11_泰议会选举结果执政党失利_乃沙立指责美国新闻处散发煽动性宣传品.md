Xinhua News Agency, March 10th: The ruling Seri Manangkasila Party of Thailand suffered a defeat in the February 26th election, securing only slightly more than half of the seats for the first category of members in the parliament.

According to the final results of the parliamentary election released by Thai officials, the Seri Manangkasila Party, which nominated over two hundred candidates in this election, won eighty-five out of the one hundred and sixty seats for the first category of members in the parliament. In the previous parliament, this ruling party held one hundred seats out of the one hundred and twenty-three seats for the first category of members. Of the sixteen incumbent cabinet ministers who ran for election this time, four were defeated.

The main right-wing opposition party, the Democratic Party, won twenty-eight seats for the first category of members in the parliament in this election. In the previous parliament, it held six seats. The Economist Party increased its seats from three in the previous parliament to nine, and the Hyde Park Movement Party, established after the last election, won two seats. The two left-wing parties that joined the Socialist United Front gained an advantage in the elections in the northeastern provinces of Thailand.

Because all one hundred and sixty second category members of parliament, who constitute half of the total seats, are appointed and are all members of the Seri Manangkasila Party, this party will still have an overwhelming majority in the new parliament and will be able to continue governing.

According to Bangkok's "World," Economist Party leader Nai Thep Chotinuchit said after the election results were announced that if the election had been conducted fairly, the Seri Manangkasila Party would not have obtained more than one-third of the eighty-five seats in the parliament.

Xinhua News Agency, March 9th: Bangkok newspapers reported that Thai Deputy Minister of Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the military and police during the state of emergency, Nai Sarit, told the press on the 4th that it was definitely wrong for the United States Information Service to distribute seditious propaganda to the Thai people during the state of emergency.

Nai Sarit said: Although we are members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, we do not need this organization to intervene at this time, because this is an internal problem.

    泰议会选举结果执政党失利
    乃沙立指责美国新闻处散发煽动性宣传品
    据新华社10日讯　泰国执政的马兰卡西拉自由党在2月26日的选举中失利，只获得议会中第一类议员的略微超过半数的席位。
    据泰国官方发表的议会选举的最后结果，在这次选举中提出二百多名候选人的马兰卡西拉自由党，获得了议会中一百六十名第一类议员中的八十五个席位。而在上届议会中，这个执政党在一百二十三名第一类议员中占一百名。它在这次选举中提出参加竞选的十六名现任内阁阁员中，有四名落选。
    主要的右翼反对党民主党在这次选举中获得了议会中第一类议员的二十八个席位。在上届议会中，它拥有六个席位。经济人党从上届议会中所占有的三席增加到九席，在上次选举后成立的海德公园运动党获得了二席。这两个加入社会主义联合阵线的左翼政党在泰国东北各府的选举中占了优势。
    因为占议会全部席位半数的由任命产生的一百六十名第二类议员全部是马兰卡西拉自由党人，所以这个党将在新的议会中仍然拥有压倒多数而得以继续执政。
    据曼谷“世界报”报道，经济人党领袖乃贴·触的努七在选举结果公布以后发表谈话说，如果选举进行得公正的话，马兰卡西拉自由党在议会中所得到的席位将不会超过八十五个席位的三分之一。
    据新华社9日讯　曼谷报纸报道，泰国国防部副部长、紧急状态期间军、警总指挥乃沙立4日向报界发表谈话说，美国新闻处在紧急状态期间向泰国民众散发煽动性宣传品是肯定地不对的。
    乃沙立说：我们虽然是东南亚条约组织的成员，但是目前并不需要这个组织进来干预，因为这是内部问题。
