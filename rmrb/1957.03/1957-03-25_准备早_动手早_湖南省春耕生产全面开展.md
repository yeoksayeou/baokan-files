Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, March 24th: This year's spring planting in Hunan Province is characterized by early preparation and early action, with farmers confident in overcoming difficulties.

The head of the Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture emphasized this point in a conversation with Xinhua News Agency reporters on the 23rd. He said that it is currently the rainy season in the south. Farmers across the province are working in the rain to carry out spring planting, prepare rice seedling beds, and accumulate soil fertilizer, with a general attendance rate of over 80%. Due to the drought last winter, approximately 12 million mu of winter-hardened paddy fields across the province could not be plowed. Currently, various localities are promoting methods such as early irrigation, early plowing, multiple plowing, multiple harrowing, and the application of more fertilizer to transform the winter-hardened fields. In some areas where there is a shortage of draught animal power, human labor is being organized to quickly dig up the hardened fields. Fertilizer is still in short supply across the province, and farmers in various localities are thinking of ways to accumulate more fertilizer. In Changde Prefecture, a major rice-producing area, an average of over 90 dan of fertilizer has already been accumulated per mu of land. In Liling County, in eastern Hunan, where the season is earlier, 79 agricultural cooperatives have already started soaking seeds around the vernal equinox (March 21st), generally half a month earlier than in previous years. In another ten days or so, sowing will be widespread throughout the province.

The official said that this year, agricultural departments at all levels in the province have learned from the experiences and lessons of last year, and adopted various measures to increase production in accordance with local conditions, which has strengthened farmers' confidence in striving for a bumper harvest. Last year, the province increased rice production by more than one billion jin simply by promoting the conversion of single-season rice to double-season rice. However, there were also a few areas where, when expanding the planting of double-season rice, the specific local conditions such as water sources, fertilizer, and labor were not fully considered, resulting in losses. This year, the double-season rice planting area in the province will be stabilized at last year's 12 million mu, with appropriate regional adjustments. Various localities will also promote two-crop or three-crop systems for rice and other crops based on different conditions, continue to increase the multiple cropping index, and strive to increase production of more grain, oil crops, etc.

The official pointed out that there are approximately 10 million mu of "low-yield fields" in the province, with each mu producing generally more than 100 jin less rice than the provincial average yield per mu. These "low-yield fields" have great potential for increased production. Last year, Hengyang Prefecture improved 1.04 million mu of "low-yield fields," increasing rice production by more than 83 million jin despite the severe drought. He said that farmers in various localities have already started to improve "low-yield fields." The Daoxian County Committee of the Communist Party of China has summarized 18 types of experience from local farmers in improving various types of "low-yield fields" and promoted them. This year, the county plans to improve more than 60,000 mu of "low-yield fields," and has already improved more than 14,000 mu.

Regarding the promotion of agricultural technology, the official pointed out that it has attracted the attention of various localities. Recently, the Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture transferred 45 responsible cadres and agricultural technicians to be stationed in five key townships to assist in the promotion of advanced agricultural technologies and explore the experience of leading collective agricultural production in order to promote farmers' efforts to achieve a bumper harvest in agriculture.

### 准备早　动手早　湖南省春耕生产全面开展

　　准备早　动手早
　　湖南省春耕生产全面开展
    新华社长沙24日电　今年湖南省春耕生产的特点是准备早，动手早，农民战胜困难有信心。
    湖南省农业厅负责人23日对新华社记者的谈话中着重指出了这点。他说，现在正是南方雨季。全省各地农民正在冒雨春耕、整秧田和积土肥，一般出勤率都在80％以上。由于去年冬季干旱，全省不能翻耕的过冬板田约有一千二百万亩。目前各地正在推广早灌水、早耕、多耕、多耙、多施肥料等办法，来改造过冬板田。有些地区牛力不足，就组织人力突击挖板田。全省肥料仍感不足，各地农民正在想办法多积肥。在主要稻谷产区常德专区，平均每亩田已经积肥九十多担。季节较早的湘东醴陵县，有七十九个农业社已经在春分（3月21日）前后浸种，一般比往年提早半个月。再过十来天，全省就要普遍播种了。
    这位负责人说，今年全省各级农业部门吸取去年的经验教训，因地制宜地采取各项增产措施，增强了农民争取大丰收的信心。去年全省单是推广把单季稻改种双季稻一项，就增产了十多亿斤稻谷。但是，也有少数地区在扩大种植双季稻的时候，没有充分估计到当地的水源、肥料和劳动力等具体情况，以致造成损失。今年全省双季稻种植面积便稳定在去年一千二百万亩的基础上，适当作一些地区上的调整。各地还将根据不同条件，分别推行水稻和其他作物的两熟制或三熟制，继续提高复种指数，争取增产更多的粮食、油料等。
    这位负责人指出，全省约有一千万亩左右的“低产田”，每亩所产稻谷一般比全省稻谷每亩平均产量低一百多斤。这些“低产田”的增产潜力很大。去年衡阳专区改良一百零四万亩“低产田”，在大旱之年仍增产了八千三百多万斤稻谷。他说，现在各地农民已经开始改良“低产田”。中共道县委员会曾经总结当地农民改良各类“低产田”的十八种经验，加以推广。今年这个县计划改良六万多亩“低产田”，目前已经改良了一万四千多亩。
    关于农业技术推广工作，这位负责人指出，已经引起各地的重视。最近，湖南省农业厅抽调负责干部和农业技术人员四十五人，分别长驻在五个重点乡，协助推广先进农业技术和摸索领导集体农业生产的经验，以推动农民争取农业大丰收。
