    Offering Surplus Steel to Support Brother Units
    Anshan Metallurgical Construction General Company Transfers Over 1,500 Tons of Various Shaped Steel

    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 11th. During discussions of this year's technical supply plan, the Anshan Metallurgical Construction General Company conducted a comprehensive inventory of its steel materials. They discovered that over 1,500 tons of various shaped steel had been stockpiled prematurely and in excessive quantities. This has now been reported to higher authorities and transferred to other construction units for use.

    The main reason for the excessive and premature stockpiling of these materials was the blind stockpiling by the technical supply department when steel materials were scarce. Materials that were temporarily unused and should have been disposed of in a timely manner were not handled promptly. In the first half of last year, there was a batch of overstocked plumbing parts and small hardware originally intended to be sold to agricultural production cooperatives in the suburban districts. However, the supply personnel heard that the supply of materials was tight and feared that if they sold them, they would not be able to buy them back, so they kept more than 20,000 pieces. These are now being studied for sale through commercial departments, and it is estimated that they can meet the needs of constructing housing for 900 employees.

    In addition, the company also found 793 dozen excessively and prematurely stockpiled screws and more than 13,700 kilograms of valuable non-ferrous metals, which were all turned over to the higher authorities.

    拿出多余钢材支援兄弟单位
    鞍山冶金建筑总公司外调各种型钢一千五百多吨
    新华社鞍山11日电  鞍山冶金建筑总公司在讨论今年技术供应计划中，对库存钢铁材料进行了全面检查，发现有一千五百多吨各种型钢储备的过早过多，现在已经报经上级机关调给其他建设单位使用。
    产生上述材料储备过多过早的主要原因，是技术供应部门在钢铁材料不足的情况下盲目储备；暂时不用，应该及时处理的材料，也没有及时处理。去年上半年本来有一批积压的水暖零件及小五金，准备卖给市郊区农业生产合作社，但供应人员听说材料供应紧张，怕卖出买不回，就留下了二万多件，现在正在研究通过商业部门售出，估计可以供建筑九百户职工住宅的需要。
    此外，这个公司还查出了过多过早储备的螺丝七百九十三罗，贵重的有色金属一万三千七百多公斤，也全部上交。
