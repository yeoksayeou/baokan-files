　　Grading Classification, Using Less Cotton, Weaving More Cotton Cloth
　　Cotton Textile Factories in Various Regions Increase Production After Overcoming Difficulties
    This News Report: Cotton textile printing and dyeing factories in Shanghai, Zhengzhou, Chongqing and other cities and in Shaanxi, Hebei, Anhui and other provinces have actively adopted measures in the face of insufficient raw cotton, and have saved cotton and increased production on the premise of ensuring quality, thereby overcoming the difficulties of insufficient raw cotton supply and creating wealth for the country.
    The main method for state-owned, joint state-private cotton textile factories in Shanghai to increase production is to make full use of limited cotton to increase the production of yarn and cloth. Starting in March, each factory will use various types of cotton separately according to the decision of the textile industry department, spin more class two yarn and weave cloth with relatively poor appearance quality, and try to use substandard raw cotton and spinning waste. It is estimated that 600,000 more bolts of cotton cloth can be produced this year, creating 50 million yuan of wealth for the country in one year.
    In the movement to increase production and practice economy, Zhengzhou State-owned Cotton No. 2 Factory, after extensively mobilizing the masses, vigorously implementing comprehensive economy, and strengthening technical management and political and ideological education for workers, reduced the average cotton consumption per yarn bale in January and February to 378.52 catties. This is 6.1 catties lower than the cotton consumption in the same period last year. A total of more than 12,800 catties of raw cotton were saved for the country, and the product quality was also improved. All 21-count yarns reached the top grade, and in addition to completing the plan for the first-class grade rate of 32-count yarns, 58% of them reached the quality of top-grade yarns.
    Chongqing 610 Factory saved more than 11,000 kilograms of raw cotton in February alone by implementing the fifteen measures to increase production and practice economy, which can weave more than 2,100 bolts of cloth.
    In order to make full use of the existing nearly 100,000 dan of low-grade raw cotton for production, Shaanxi Province has adopted the method of classifying according to product use, formulating different blending ratios for different varieties and different uses, and implementing the policy of using superior cotton for superior products and inferior cotton for inferior products, thereby changing the past situation of not arranging production according to product use and reducing the waste caused by the mutual transportation of cotton, yarn and cloth. In this way, more than 110 million meters of cotton cloth can be produced this year.
    According to the supply situation of raw cotton this year, the Hebei Provincial Textile Bureau has maximized the utilization rate of raw materials, developed new raw material resources, and appropriately adjusted product varieties according to the opinions of the commercial department. The state-owned cotton mills throughout the province can increase the production of cotton cloth by 13 million meters throughout the year. In January and February, the yarn and cloth quality of Shijiazhuang Daxing Textile Factory both completed the plan, and saved more than 10,900 kilograms of raw cotton and more than 880 kilograms of raw yarn.
    Wuhu Textile Factory in Anhui Province and Anhui No. 1 Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory have achieved certain results in increasing production by reducing losses, increasing the output rate, and changing product specifications in order to overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials. Wuhu Textile Factory saved more than 36,000 catties of raw cotton in January and February due to reduced losses and increased output rate, and the average cotton consumption per yarn bale was 6.65 kilograms lower than the national plan. Anhui No. 1 Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory changed 21-count yarns to 22-count and 24-count yarns, and saved 8.6 kilograms of raw cotton for every 1,000 meters of cotton cloth woven, while maintaining the length and width of the cloth unchanged.
    The facts of increased production in the cotton mills of the above provinces and cities fully illustrate that there is "profit" to be made in the textile sector. Although raw cotton is insufficient, as long as we can find a way, we can still achieve the goal of increasing production.

    分等论级　少用棉花　多织棉布
　　各地棉纺织厂克服困难后产量增加
    本报讯　上海、郑州、重庆等市和陕西、河北、安徽等省的棉纺织印染厂，在原棉不足的情况下，积极采取措施，并在保证质量的基础上，节约用棉，增加产量，因而克服了原棉供应不足的困难，为国家创造了财富。
    上海市各地方国营、公私合营棉纺织厂增加生产的主要方法是，充分利用有限的棉花增产纱布。3月份起，各厂根据纺织工业部门决定把各类棉花分别使用，适当多纺一些外观质量较差的二级纱织布，尽量利用次等级的原棉和纺纱下脚，估计今年可多生产六十万匹棉布，一年可为国家创造五千万元的财富。
    郑州国棉二厂在增产节约运动中，经过普遍发动群众，厉行全面节约，加强了技术管理和对工人的政治思想教育以后，1、2月份每件纱平均用棉量已降低到三百七十八点五二市斤。比去年同期用棉量降低了六点一斤。共为国家节约原棉一万二千八百多斤，而产品质量也有所提高，仅二十一支纱全部达到上等一级，三十二支纱除完成了一等一级品率的计划外，其中并有58％达到了上等纱的质量。
    重庆六一零厂在贯彻十五项增产节约措施中，仅2月份就节约原棉一万一千多公斤，能织二千一百多匹布。
    陕西省为了充分利用现有的近十万担低级原棉进行生产，采用了按照产品用途进行分类，制定不同品种不同用途的不同混棉，贯彻了优棉优用，劣棉劣用的方针，因而改变了过去不根据产品用途来安排生产的情况，减少了棉、纱、布相向运输所带来的浪费。这样今年可增产棉布一亿一千多公尺。
    河北省纺织管理局根据今年原棉的供应情况，最大限度发挥原料的利用率，开发新的原料资源，并根据商业部门的意见，适当地调整了产品品种，全省各国营棉纺厂全年就可增产棉布一千三百万公尺。石家庄大兴纺织厂1、2月份纱布质量都完成了计划，并节约原棉一万零九百多公斤，节约原纱八百八十余公斤。
    安徽省芜湖纺织厂和安徽第一纺织印染厂，为了克服原材料不足的困难，在减少损耗，提高出品率，改变产品规格等以达到增加产量方面取得了一定的成绩。芜湖纺织厂由于减少损耗和提高出品率，1、2月份共节约原棉三万六千多斤，每件纱的用棉量平均比国家计划低六点六五公斤。安徽第一纺织印染厂将二十一支纱分别改为二十二和二十四支纱，在保持布的长度和宽度不变的前提下，每织一千公尺棉布就可节约原棉八点六公斤。
    从以上各省市棉纺厂增产的事实，充分说明了纺织部门是有“油水”的，虽然原棉不足，只要能想办法，同样可以达到增产的目的。
