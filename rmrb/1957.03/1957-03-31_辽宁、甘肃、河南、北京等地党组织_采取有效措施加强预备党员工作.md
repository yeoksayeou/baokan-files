Party Organizations in Liaoning, Gansu, Henan, Beijing and Other Places
　　Take Effective Measures to Strengthen the Work of Probationary Party Members

　　(Our dispatch) Since the fourth quarter of last year, party organizations in various places have successively adopted various measures to effectively strengthen the work of probationary party members.

　　In order to strengthen the work of probationary party members, party organizations in Liaoning, Shandong, Henan, Guangdong, Gansu, Beijing and other provinces and cities first reviewed and summarized the past situation and experience of the work of probationary party members, criticized the idea and practice of some party organizations that only pay attention to the work of accepting probationary party members and do not pay attention to the work of probationary party members, and required party organizations at all levels to regard the work of educating, examining and regularizing probationary party members as an important current task.

　　Party organizations in various places have taken many effective measures to strengthen the work of probationary party members. Since November of last year, Gansu Province has generally conducted party constitution education for probationary party members by means of decentralized collective training or during party classes. Many grassroots party organizations in Shenyang City focus on conducting basic party knowledge education for probationary party members with low education levels during party day activities; for probationary party members with self-study ability, they organize them to study on their own. The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also stipulates that the quality of probationary party members' study of basic party knowledge should be regarded as one of the conditions for whether they can be transferred to full party members. The Hunan Provincial Committee requires that new party member training classes be held in rural areas, amateur party schools be held in towns and government agencies, and schools use the gaps during winter and summer vacations to train probationary party members.

　　Party organizations in Liaoning, Shandong, Henan and other provinces attach great importance to examining the political qualities of probationary party members in the party's organizational life and various practical work. Party organizations in Changge County, Henan Province, and other places assign branch committee members, party group leaders, and party introducers to be responsible for individually educating and examining probationary party members in practical work. Many grassroots party organizations in Hebei, Beijing, Shenyang and Dalian have also established a system for regularly assessing probationary party members, conducting a comprehensive review of the thinking and work of probationary party members at regular intervals, and helping probationary party members to overcome shortcomings in a timely manner.

　　In order to ensure that everyone who is transferred to a full party member fully meets the conditions of a party member, party organizations in various places earnestly handle the issue of the regularization of probationary party members. The Hunan Provincial Committee has requested party organizations at all levels to conduct a general survey of probationary party members, understand the work and thinking of each probationary party member, so as to better work with them and handle their regularization issues. The Xidan District Committee in Beijing has studied all probationary party members who have completed their probationary period one by one, and put forward preliminary opinions on how to deal with them in accordance with the spirit of raising the standards for party members. In the fourth quarter of last year, Dalian City found that although some probationary party members had completed their probationary period, the party organization had not seriously conducted education and examination work on them. In order to avoid formalism and regularization on schedule, the Dalian Municipal Committee decided that for those probationary party members who have not been seriously educated and examined, education and examination work should be strengthened first, and then their regularization issues should be discussed and dealt with separately after a period of time.

　　辽宁、甘肃、河南、北京等地党组织
　　采取有效措施加强预备党员工作
    本报讯  各地党组织从去年第四季度开始，先后采取各种措施切实加强对预备党员的工作。
    辽宁、山东、河南、广东、甘肃、北京等省市的党组织，为了加强预备党员的工作，首先检查和总结了过去预备党员工作的情况和经验，批判了某些党组织只注意接收预备党员的工作，不注意对预备党员进行工作的思想和作法，要求各级党组织把作好预备党员的教育、考察和转正工作，当做当前的重要任务。
    各地党组织采取了很多有效措施加强预备党员工作。甘肃省各地从去年11月就采用分片集训的办法或者在上党课的时候，普遍地对预备党员进行党章教育。沈阳市很多党的基层组织，对文化程度低的预备党员，在党日活动的时间，集中进行党的基础知识教育；对有自学能力的预备党员，则组织他们自学。中共沈阳市委还规定：预备党员对党的基础知识学习的好坏，应作为能否转为正式党员的条件之一。湖南省委要求：农村举办新党员训练班、城镇和机关可举办业余党校、学校则利用寒暑假的空隙，对预备党员进行训练。
    辽宁、山东、河南等省的党组织都十分重视在党的组织生活和各项实际工作中考察预备党员的政治品质。河南省长葛县及其他地方的党组织，由支部委员、党的小组长和入党介绍人分工负责，在实际工作中个别地教育考察预备党员。河北、北京、沈阳和旅大等地许多党的基层组织，还建立了对预备党员进行定期鉴定的制度，每隔一定时间，对预备党员的思想和工作情况，进行一次全面的检查，帮助预备党员及时克服缺点。
    为了保证每一个转为正式党员的人都完全具备党员条件，各地党的组织都认真地处理预备党员的转正问题。湖南省委已要求各级党组织对预备党员进行一次摸底排队，掌握每个预备党员的工作和思想情况，以便更好地对他们进行工作和处理他们的转正问题。北京市西单区委已将所有预备期满的预备党员，逐个进行了研究，根据更加提高党员标准的精神，分别提出处理的初步意见。旅大市在去年第四季度，发现有些预备党员的预备期虽满，但是党的组织并没有认真地对他们进行教育和考察工作，为了避免形式主义的按期转正，旅大市委决定对于这些没有认真进行教育考察工作的预备党员，应首先加强教育考察工作，经过一个时期以后，再分别讨论处理他们的转正问题。
