　　Old in Years, Young at Heart
　　——“Diary of Returning Home” - Part 4

    After breakfast, I took a walk on the street. Everywhere, from the main streets to the alleys, were people dressed in colorful clothes. Young wives and girls, in strings one after another, were going from door to door to see the new bride. In front of the village clinic was a dried-up river that ran through the village. Inside and outside the riverbed were children setting off firecrackers.
    My cousin said that this river divides the whole village into two halves in the summer. It's very inconvenient for farmers going to the fields, children going to school, and even for new brides visiting their parents' homes. For many years, the villagers had dreamed of building a bridge, but it never happened. Now, with the establishment of the advanced agricultural cooperative, the first thing they did was to tackle this major project. The government provided a portion of the loan, and the cooperative organized labor to quarry dozens of large stone blocks from the mountains. They were preparing to start construction after the Spring Festival.
    While my cousin and I were discussing the bridge construction, "Old Man Dong" from the village led his children over, smiling and greeting us. In fact, he was not yet fifty years old, but in the old society, his wife died, and then he suffered a fire, which ruined his life. Unknowingly, his face filled with wrinkles, and his hair turned white. From then on, the villagers called him "Old Man Dong." This man had always been very optimistic since childhood. He liked to sing Peking Opera. Whether he was going up the mountain to chop firewood or plowing the fields, he always carried a copy of "Peking Opera Grand View" in his pocket. Whenever he took a break, he would sing loudly. Later, he even developed to the point where he could play occasional roles in old opera troupes. After the disaster, he stopped farming and simply hung around in an old opera troupe in a town, and married a maid in the troupe as his wife. From then on, the villagers looked down on him, saying that he was too frivolous and didn't do proper work.
    After liberation, he returned to the village and settled down. He was an active participant in village Yangko dances and operas, but he was almost always the most backward when it came to labor. In 1955, the great storm of agricultural cooperation came, and he immediately signed up to join the cooperative. He secretly said to his wife at night: "What are we still worried about? I've seen through socialism. Shared blessings, shared misfortunes. Joining the cooperative means everyone will have a good life. We can't let ourselves go hungry." From then on, there was indeed not a trace of worry on his face, but he still dawdled when he worked. Although he was very enthusiastic about the village drama troupe, the masses looked down on him and even ridiculed him. However, every New Year, if the troupe could perform a few good plays and let everyone enjoy themselves, "Old Man Dong's" prestige in the village would temporarily increase a little.
    However, the troupe couldn't just perform Peking Opera all the time; sometimes they had to mix in some new plays, such as "Mutual Aid and Cooperation is Good," "Transforming the Laggards," "The Little Son-in-Law," and so on. "Old Man Dong" always wanted to show off his skills in this area. For example, once, he got a script from the district about transforming laggards, and he spent two nights adapting it into Peking Opera form, calling it "New Play, Old Performance." "Old Man Dong" himself played the role of the laggard. He wore a half-length jacket, a crooked melon-skin hat, and used white powder to paint his eyes and nose like a clown in Peking Opera. He first sang a section of Erhuang in a lazy manner, and then, after being criticized by the cooperative director and production team members, he made a self-criticism in the form of dialogue. Finally, he transformed into a "labor model." Although this play was adapted in a very awkward way, he won the praise of the masses. When he walked down the street with a complacent mood, some people said in a tone that was both praise and a little sarcastic: "'Old Man Dong,' you performed well; you, if you could become a labor model like that laggard in the play yourself, that would be great…" "Old Man Dong" felt comfortable in his heart, but his face was burning. Sometimes he couldn't sleep at night because he was irritable, so he would lose his temper and argue with his wife.
    A person needs help the most when the ideological struggle is fierce. The cooperative cadres understood his emotions, so they were considerate of him, encouraged him, helped him solve his difficulties in life, and at the same time repeatedly enlightened him, so that he understood that the happy life of socialism does not fall from the sky, but must be created with one's own two hands. Later, the whole village merged into an advanced cooperative, and the club was also reorganized. The leadership let "Old Man Dong" take charge of the club. He was deeply moved and slowly changed. The villagers' impression of him improved day by day. "Old Man Dong" realized that his labor, what he did, was needed by society and welcomed by the masses, and he felt that the road ahead was wider. He often worked in the fields all day and then stayed up half the night at the club, almost returning to the optimistic mood he had when he was young.
    That afternoon, the village club was performing Peking Opera again in the large courtyard west of the agricultural cooperative office. It was said that this was the most interesting entertainment during the Spring Festival for all four hundred households in the village, and no matter adults or children, whenever they mentioned opera, they always mentioned "Old Man Dong." When I arrived at the courtyard at three o'clock in the afternoon, the play was almost over. I saw a female character sitting in the middle of the stage, covering her head and face with a red scarf. To the right of the female character was a young male character, and to the left was an eunuch and two other officials. An old woman sitting next to me told me that it was "Phoenix Returns to Its Nest," and the female character in the middle was named Cheng Xue'e. After a while, a maid took off the female character's headscarf. I fixed my eyes and took a closer look, and oh my god! It turned out to be "Old Man Dong"! He had applied two layers of powder to his face, and rouge on his cheeks. The wrinkles on his face were clearly visible. It was said that the young man mistakenly recognized Cheng Xue'e's ugly sister as Cheng Xue'e, so he didn't want to marry her. But after he passed through the door and lifted the headscarf, he turned out to be a perfect beauty. Therefore, Cheng Xue'e felt wronged and cried out. When "Old Man Dong" cried out, everyone under the stage laughed. The old woman next to me opened her toothless mouth and said while laughing: "Look at you all, Old Man Dong has really become old in years, young at heart!"
    "Old Man Dong" is indeed "old in years, young at heart;" but in my opinion, the old people under the stage who laughed until they had tears in their eyes are almost all "old in years, young at heart."

　　老来少
　　——“回乡日记”之四
　　吕建中
    吃过早饭，到大街上走走，街头巷尾到处是穿花衣服的人。年轻的媳妇和姑娘们，一串跟着一串挨门逐户看新媳妇。乡里诊疗所门前是一条干涸了的穿街大河，河里河外全是放爆竹的孩子。
    表弟说，这条河一到夏天就把全村隔成两半了。农民下地，孩子上学，以至新媳妇走娘家，都很不方便。村里人多少年来就梦想修一座桥，总不能实现，现在建立高级农业社，第一年就着手办这件大事情了，政府贷给一部分款，社里组织劳力上山凿了几十根大石条，过了春节就准备动工。
    我和表弟正谈论修桥的事，村上“董老头”领着孩子笑嘻嘻地走过来问好。其实他还不满五十岁，只因在旧社会里，他死了妻子，又招了一把火，日子败下来，他不知不觉添了满脸皱纹，头发也愁白了，从此村里人便唤他做“董老头”。这人从小就很乐观，喜欢唱京戏，上山打柴，下泊犁田，腰里总是揣着一本“京剧大观”，一歇下来就喝喝??地唱，后来竟发展到能在旧戏班里客串了。自从遭事以后，他地也不种了，索性到一个城镇的旧戏班里混事，又讨了戏班里一个女佣人做妻子。从此村里人看不起他了，说他太流气，不务正业。
    解放以后，他又回到村里安了家。村里扮秧歌、演戏他是积极分子，但是劳动起来他差不多是最落后的一个。1955年农业合作化的大风暴来了，他立刻报名入社，晚上回家悄悄对妻子说：“还愁什么，社会主义我算看透了。有福同享，有罪同遭，入社大家都过好日子，也不能叫咱自己挨饿。”从此他脸上确是没有一丝愁容，而干起活来却照样是吊儿浪当。尽管他对村里的剧团挺热心，群众却看不起他，甚至讽刺他。不过每逢年节，要是剧团能演上几出好戏，让大伙看个痛快，“董老头”在村里的威信也就暂时提高一点。
    不过剧团里不能光演京戏，有时也得掺合着演点新戏，像互助合作好、改造懒汉、“小女婿”，等等。在这方面“董老头”总是想露一手的。比方有一次，他从区里弄回来一个改造懒汉的剧本，他花两个晚上把它改编成京剧形式，名之曰“新剧旧演”，那个懒汉角色由“董老头”自己来担任，他身穿半截夹袄，歪戴一顶瓜皮帽，眼睛和鼻梁上用白粉勾画成像京戏里的丑角样儿，他先是懒懒散散地唱一段二簧，后来受到了社主任和生产队员们的批评，于是又用道白的形式做一番自我检讨，最后，他转变成“劳动模范”了。尽管这出戏改编得不伦不类，他却博得了群众的赞许。当他怀着得意的心情走到大街上的时候，有些人就以一种又夸奖又带点讽刺的语气说道：“‘董老头’，您演得不错；您呀，要是您自己能像戏里那懒汉变成个劳动模范就好了。……”“董老头”听了这话，心里舒服，脸上又发烧，夜里有时心里烦躁得睡不着，就跟他妻子发脾气、吵架。
    一个人，在思想斗争激烈的时候是最需要人家帮助的。社干部明白了他这种情绪，便体贴他，鼓励他，帮他解决生活上的困难，同时也反复开导他，让他懂得社会主义的幸福生活不是从天上掉下来的，而是要靠自己的两只手去创造。后来，全村合并成了一个高级社，俱乐部也整顿了一番，领导上就放手把俱乐部交给“董老头”负责。他深受感动，慢慢地转变了，村里人对他的印象也一天比一天好。“董老头”意识到自己的劳动，自己所做的事情，为社会所需要，也为群众所欢迎，也就越觉得眼前的路子宽了。他常常白天下地劳动一天，晚上又在俱乐部里忙半夜，差不多又恢复到他年轻时候那种乐观情绪了。
    这天下午，村里俱乐部又在农业社办公室西边大院里演京戏。据说这是全村四百多户人家春节当中最感兴趣的一次娱乐，而且不论大人小孩，一提起演戏总是要提到“董老头”。我下午三点钟到大院的时候戏快要演完了。只见台子当中坐着一个花旦，用一条红头巾蒙住了头和脸，花旦右边是一个小生，左边是一个太监和另外两个什么官儿。坐在我旁边的一个老太婆告诉我那演的是“凤还巢”，当中那个花旦名叫程雪娥。不一会，一个丫环把那花旦的头巾取下来了，我定睛一看，天哪！原来是“董老头”！他脸上抹了两把粉，搽了两腮红，脸上的皱纹看得清清楚楚。据说，因为那个小生错把程雪娥的丑姐姐认作程雪娥，便不想娶她了，可是等过了门揭开头巾一看，原来是个绝妙佳人。因此程雪娥感到冤屈，喂呀呀地哭起来。“董老头”这一喂呀不要紧，满台子底下的人却笑开了，我旁边那个老太婆张着没牙大嘴边笑边说：“您都看看哪，董老头真成了个老来少！”
      “董老头”固然是“老来少”；不过据我看，台子底下那些笑出了眼泪的老年人差不多也都是“老来少”。
