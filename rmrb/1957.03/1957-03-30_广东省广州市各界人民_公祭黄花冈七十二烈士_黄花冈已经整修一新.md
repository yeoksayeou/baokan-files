Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 29th. People from all walks of life in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City today held a public memorial ceremony in front of the Tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang.

Some organs and people's organizations of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, as well as the Guangdong Provincial Committee, Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and provincial and municipal organizations of various democratic parties, sent representatives to participate in the public memorial. The People's Committee of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, and other units, presented wreaths in front of the martyrs' tomb.

The chief officiant, Yao Yuping, was one of the planners of the March 29th Uprising forty-six years ago. At that time, he served as the head of the dispatch section under the leadership of Mr. Huang Keqiang. Those accompanying the sacrifice included Qiu Zhe, Deputy Governor of Guangdong Province, Sun Leyi and Li Langru, Deputy Mayors of Guangzhou City, and Zhang Zhangcun, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, among others.

Xu Huanhui and Xu Xiliu, two elderly survivors who participated in the March 29th battle, made a special trip from Huaxian County, dozens of miles away, to attend the public memorial.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 29th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Rijing reported: Huanghuagang, located in the suburbs of Guangzhou, has been completely renovated.

In the past, the road in the middle was muddy and winding, without even enough space for cars to pass each other. Now, this narrow road has been transformed into a smooth asphalt road. On both sides of the road, stretching for more than ten miles, the area that used to be mostly weedy and barren hills is now connected to the city's buildings by newly built workers' new villages, overseas Chinese new villages, and other buildings.

The handwriting of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, engraved on the horizontal plaque of the stone main gate of Huanghuagang, radiates a golden glow after being refreshed. Upon entering the gate, the thirty-six needle pines planted several years ago have been trimmed into flower towers. The yellow flowers newly planted on the hill are in full bloom. Gong Xuecheng, an old worker who has been guarding Huanghuagang for nearly forty years, recalled the destruction of Huanghuagang by the reactionary rulers and said: Only after the liberation of Guangzhou did the People's Government renovate Huanghuagang every year, and it has taken on a new look.

The more than four thousand eucalyptus and casuarina trees planted in 1951 have grown to be twenty or thirty feet tall. Recently, cadres from Guangzhou's government organs came here again to plant more than three thousand Taiwan acacia trees. Management personnel said: The area of Huanghuagang has also expanded from 130,000 square meters in the past to more than 160,000 square meters in recent years.

　　广东省广州市各界人民
　　公祭黄花冈七十二烈士
　　黄花冈已经整修一新
    新华社广州29日电  广东省、广州市各界人民今天在黄花冈七十二烈士墓前举行了公祭。
    广东省和广州市部分机关、人民团体以及中共广东省委员会、广州市委员会和各民主党派的省、市组织，都派人参加公祭。广东省和广州市的人民委员会等单位在烈士墓前献了花圈。
    主祭人姚雨平是四十六年前3月29日起义的筹划人之一，他当时在黄克强先生领导下担任调度课课长。陪祭者有广东省副省长丘哲、广州市副市长孙乐宜、李朗如，还有政协广东省委员会副主席张?村等人。
    当年参加过3月29日一役战斗的生还者徐焕辉、徐锡流两位老人，还特地从几十里外的花县赶来参加公祭。
    据新华社广州29日电  新华社记者陈日晶报道：位于广州市郊外的黄花冈已经整修一新。
    过去，这里中间的一条道路泥泞曲折，连汽车相避的地方也没有。现在这条狭窄的道路已改建成光滑的沥青大路了。道路两旁纵横十几里的地方，过去绝大部分都是杂草丛生的荒野山丘，现在，新建的工人新村、华侨新村等一幢幢楼房，已经把它们和市区的建筑物连接起来。
    黄花冈石制正门牌楼的横额上刻着的孙中山先生的手笔，刷新后放射出一片金黄色的亮光。进了门，那三十六棵几年前种上的针松，修剪得就像一座座的花塔。冈上新近栽植的遍地黄花正在盛开。一位看管黄花冈近四十年的老工人龚学成回忆了黄花冈被反动统治者摧残的情况后说：直至广州解放后，人民政府对黄花冈每年都进行修葺，这里才面貌一新。
    1951年栽植的四千多棵细叶桉和木麻王树，已长得两三丈高了。最近广州市的机关干部又来这里栽了三千多棵台湾相思树。管理人员说：黄花冈的面积也由过去的十三万平方公尺扩展到了近年的十六万多平方公尺。
