Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an. Shaanxi Province Vice Governor Xie Huaide, just back from inspecting spring production work in the countryside, told Xinhua reporters that farmers everywhere are busily engaged in spring plowing. Wheat seedlings, rapeseed, and broad beans are generally growing well in most areas, and early autumn field management is relatively meticulous. However, judging from the overall situation, the shortage of fertilizer, water conservancy facilities, and draught animals is severe in various regions, and these problems must be quickly resolved.

He said that many agricultural cooperatives have not completed their pre-spring plowing fertilizer accumulation plans. It is estimated that 20% to 30% of the province's more than four million mu of cotton fields still lack base fertilizer. In Qishan and Dali counties, many agricultural cooperatives are mixing fertilizer and soil in a ratio of one to six, resulting in poor quality "moving yellow soil." Many areas have not paid enough attention to mass-based small-scale water conservancy projects. Most of the more than 30,000 unfinished wells left over from last winter have not been further excavated and lined; and the more than 20,000 new wells planned to be dug this year have also not all started construction. In terms of draught animals, according to statistics from Lintong, Weinan, and Sanyuan counties, there is a shortage of more than 13,000 draught animals. He said that due to the above situation, problems of competition for water, fertilizer, and animals between wheat and cotton have already occurred in many areas.

Xie Huaide said that the reasons for the above situation are mainly due to the blind optimism that has grown in some cadres and the masses due to last year's bumper harvest, and the reorganisation of some agricultural cooperatives last winter was not well integrated with winter production, thus affecting this year's spring plowing preparations.

Xie Huaide said: Now that spring plowing and production have entered a busy season, responsible comrades at all levels must go deep into the grassroots, strengthen specific leadership through inspection, vigorously mobilize the masses, and combine with the current spring plowing and production to find all possible ways to remedy the "three insufficiencies" in spring plowing preparations.

　　陕西存在肥料、水利、耕畜三不足现象
　  副省长谢怀德说：应结合春耕生产弥补备耕的不足
    据新华社西安电　刚从农村检查春季生产工作回来的陕西省副省长谢怀德对新华社记者说，目前各地农民正在紧张地进行春耕工作，绝大部分地区的麦苗、油菜、胡豆都生长较好，早秋田的管理工作也较为细致。但是从整个情况看来，各地肥料、水利、耕畜不足的情况严重，必须赶快解决。
    他说，许多农业社没有完成春耕前的积肥计划。全省四百多万亩棉田估计有20％到30％还缺基肥。岐山、大荔县不少农业社积的肥料粪和土是一比六，形成黄土搬家，质量很差。很多地区对群众性的小型水利工作注意不够。去冬遗留的三万多眼半成井极大部分没有继续掏箍；今年计划新打的两万多眼井，也还没有全部动工。在耕畜方面，据临潼、渭南、三原三个县统计，就缺少一万三千多头耕畜。他说，由于上述情况的存在，现在不少地区已经发生麦棉争水、争肥、争畜的问题。
    谢怀德说，造成以上情况的原因，主要是由于部分干部和群众因去年丰收而滋长了盲目乐观情绪，部分农业社去冬的转社、整社工作也没有很好地结合冬季生产来进行，因此，影响了今年的春耕准备工作。
    谢怀德说：现在春耕生产已经进入繁忙季节，各级负责同志必须深入下去，通过检查，加强具体领导，大力发动群众，结合当前春耕生产，想尽一切办法，弥补春耕准备中的“三不足”。
