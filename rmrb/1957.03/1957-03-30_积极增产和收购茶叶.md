Actively Increase Production and Purchase Tea
*People's Daily* Commentator

Tea is an important export commodity for our country and a beverage for the vast number of people domestically. Tea is produced in the mountainous and hilly areas of more than 600 counties in 15 provinces of our country. Zhejiang Province alone has 3.15 million tea farmers, and Anhui Province has 2.4 million. Approximately over 30 million people across the country are directly involved in tea production. In key tea-producing areas such as Qimen in Anhui, Anhua in Hunan, and Shengxian in Zhejiang, tea income accounts for 60% to 70% of total agricultural income. Tea is an indispensable necessity for ethnic minorities in Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Xinjiang, and other regions. Currently, 37 countries around the world import tea from our country. From 1950 to 1956, exported tea could be exchanged for 1.86 million tons of steel or over 30,000 tractors. The total value of exported tea could build nearly ten railways from Shanghai to Beijing or twenty seamless steel pipe factories. Therefore, developing tea production is of great significance for supporting the country's socialist industrial construction, strengthening national unity, and improving the lives of people in mountainous areas.

Since liberation, tea production in our country has increased year by year, but it has not yet recovered to pre-war levels. In 1956, tea production was only 70% of the pre-war average annual output, and exports were only one-third of the highest annual export volume in history. Currently, domestic sales amount to less than three taels per person per year when calculated based on the national population. The national tea purchase plan for 1957 only increased by about 7.5% compared to the actual results in 1956, but domestic sales increased by 16%, including a 26% increase in supplies to ethnic minorities and about a 30% increase in supplies for export. The production and sales arrangements are very tight. This is because the supply of other materials domestically is tight, preventing large-scale exports, so tea exports have to be increased. At the same time, in order to meet the needs of the people domestically, especially the needs of ethnic minorities, domestic tea sales plans should be increased accordingly, which is necessary. Some people believe that the potential for tea production increase is not great, and production and purchase plans should not be increased, even advocating for a reduction compared to last year's actual results. This view is not a correct reflection of objective reality but rather a disregard or underestimation of the current potential for tea production and a neglect of this year's favorable factors.

Our country currently has over 5 million mu of tea gardens, with an average yield of only about 50 jin of dried tea per mu. The yield per unit area is too low, only one-third of that of tea-producing countries such as the Soviet Union, India, and Ceylon, and also far behind some high-yield tea gardens domestically. Facts prove that as long as we strengthen the fertilization and management of tea gardens, the yield per unit area can be rapidly increased. In Wuhu Prefecture, Anhui, 72% of the tea gardens in the area were fertilized in 1956, and the average yield increased by 24% compared to 1955. Many agricultural cooperatives increased production by more than 50%. This year, despite the tight supply of grain and fertilizer, the state continues to provide preferential grain supplies for tea picking and processing and vigorously supplies miscellaneous fertilizers such as tung oil cake, and will prioritize the supply of chemical fertilizers as much as possible in areas with customary use of chemical fertilizers. Local tea purchasing departments should closely integrate with production, and in addition to doing a good job in supplying tea fertilizers, they should cooperate with agricultural departments to actively guide tea farmers in tea garden fertilization and management.

During the spring tea production season in 1956, some tea-producing agricultural cooperatives, due to insufficient understanding of the significance of tea production and a lack of experience in rationally arranging agricultural and tea production labor, faced a serious shortage of labor for tea picking and processing. As a result, many tea leaves were not fully picked or were not picked in time, reducing the quality of tea, reducing farmers' income, and affecting the completion of the national purchase plan, thus exacerbating the tea supply shortage. This year, various localities have learned from the lessons of last year, agricultural cooperatives have accumulated experience, and agricultural and purchasing departments, through tea pre-purchases, have actively helped agricultural cooperatives plan production, comprehensively arrange tea farmers' production labor, promote tea contracting and processing, establish a production responsibility system, rationally stipulate labor quotas and quota remuneration, and pre-distribute them in a timely manner, maximizing the production enthusiasm of the masses, picking all the available tea leaves completely and timely, and creating more high-yield records.

In recent years, tea purchase prices have increased year by year, and the current tea purchase prices are able to stimulate production. Local purchasing departments should improve the policy and technical level of tea evaluators, implement the mass line working methods such as "sample tea to the cooperatives" and "democratic evaluation of tea based on samples," consult with the masses, and implement the price policy of "pricing according to quality." Only in this way can we promote the development of tea production.

Tea has a strong seasonality. Local purchasing departments should make preparations as soon as possible, rationally adjust the purchasing network, facilitate the masses' sales, and facilitate guidance on the masses' initial processing techniques.

Currently, the quality of tea still cannot meet the needs of domestic and international markets, and the production of high-grade tea is too low. Therefore, we must assist agricultural cooperatives in improving technology, ensuring quality, increasing the income of the masses, and stimulating increased production. Local agricultural departments and purchasing departments should actively organize technical forces to strengthen initial processing technical guidance and change the practice of "receiving whatever comes."

The time for tea to market is approaching. Local agricultural and purchasing departments should seize the opportunity, use all favorable conditions, and correctly implement various effective production-increasing measures.

　　积极增产和收购茶叶
　　本报评论员
    茶叶是我国重要出口物资，国内广大人民的饮料。我国十五个省六百余县的山区丘陵地带都产茶叶。其中浙江省就有茶农三百一十五万人，安徽省也有二百四十万人。全国直接参加茶叶生产的约有三千多万人。安徽祁门、湖南安化、浙江嵊县等重点产茶区，茶叶收入占农业总收入60％到70％。茶叶对内蒙古、西藏、新疆等地区的兄弟民族，是不可缺少的生活必需品。目前世界上已有三十七个国家输入我国的茶叶。1950年至1956年出口的茶叶，可换回一百八十六万吨钢材，或三万多辆拖拉机。出口茶叶总值可建设将近十条由上海到北京的铁路，或建设二十个无缝钢管厂。因此，发展茶叶生产对支援国家社会主义工业建设，加强民族团结，改善山区人民的生活，都有重大意义。
    解放以来，我国茶叶生产逐年增长，但仍未恢复到战前水平。1956年茶叶产量仅为战前常年平均产量的70％，出口量也只相当于历史上最高年出口量的三分之一。国内现销售量按全国人口计算，每人每年平均不到三两。1957年国家茶叶采购计划较1956年实绩仅增长约7.5％，但国内销售增长16％，其中供应兄弟民族部分增长26％，供应出口增长30％左右。产销安排是十分紧张的。这是因为国内其他物资供应紧张，不能大量出口，只好多增加一些茶叶出口。同时为了满足国内人民的需要，特别是兄弟民族的需要，国内茶叶销售计划相应地增长一些，也是应该的。有人认为目前茶叶增产潜力已经不大，生产、采购计划不宜增加，甚至主张比去年实绩减少，这种看法不是客观实际的正确反映，而是抹煞或低估当前茶叶生产潜力、忽视今年有利因素的结果。
    我国现有五百余万亩茶园，平均每亩只产干茶五十斤左右。单位面积产量太低，只相当于苏联、印度、锡兰等产茶国家的三分之一，也大大的落后于国内某些丰产茶园。事实证明，只要加强茶园肥培管理工作，单位面积产量是可以迅速提高的。安徽芜湖专区1956年全区72％的茶园施了肥，平均产量较1955年增加了24％。很多农业社增产达50％以上。今年国家在粮食、肥料供应紧张的情况下，继续对采制茶叶增加粮食优待供应，并大力供应桐子饼等杂肥，还将在有习惯使用化学肥料的地区尽可能优先供应化学肥料。各地茶叶采购部门应当紧密地与生产结合，除作好茶用肥料供应工作外，并配合农业部门积极指导茶农进行茶园肥培管理工作。
    1956年春茶生产季节，有些茶区农业社由于对茶叶生产的意义认识不足，缺乏合理安排农、茶生产劳动力的经验，以致茶叶采制劳动力严重不足，许多茶叶没有全部采摘下来，或采得不及时，降低了茶叶品质，减少了农民收入，也影响了国家采购计划的完成，加重了茶叶供应的紧张，今年各地吸取了去年的教训，农业社积累了经验，农业及采购部门通过茶叶预购，积极帮助农业社规划生产，全面安排茶农生产劳动力，推行茶叶包工、包制，建立生产责任制，合理规定劳动定额及定额报酬，并适时预分，最大限度地发挥群众的生产积极性，把可采的茶叶全部的及时的采摘下来，并创造更多的丰产纪录。
    几年来茶叶收购价格逐年提高，目前茶叶收购价格是能够刺激生产的，各地采购部门要提高评茶人员的政策和技术水平，实行“样茶到社”、“民主对样评茶”等群众路线的工作方法，同群众协商，贯彻“按质论价”的价格政策。必须如此，才能促进茶叶生产的发展。
    茶叶季节性很强，各地采购部门应当尽快做好各项准备工作，合理调整采购网，便利群众投售，便于指导群众初制技术。
    目前茶叶品质还不能适应国内外市场的需要，高级茶生产太少。因此就要协助农业社提高技术，保证质量，增加群众收益，刺激增产。各地农业部门与采购部门应当积极组织技术力量，加强初制技术指导工作，改变“来什么，收什么”的作法。
    目前茶叶上市时间已经迫近，各地农业及采购部门应抓紧时机，运用一切有利条件，正确的贯彻各种有效的增产措施。
