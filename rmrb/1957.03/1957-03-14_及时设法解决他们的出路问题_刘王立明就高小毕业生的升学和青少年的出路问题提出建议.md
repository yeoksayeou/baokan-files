    Find Ways to Solve Their Problems Promptly
    Liu Wang Liming Offers Suggestions on the Issues of Further Education for Higher Primary Graduates and Opportunities for Young People

    After listening to the reports and speeches of the leaders and committee members, I would like to offer some opinions on the issue of further education for higher primary graduates and opportunities for young people, concerning the principle of "overall consideration and appropriate arrangements." It is said that after this summer vacation, due to the limited number of places in schools, many higher primary, junior high, and senior high graduates across the country will have no place to continue their studies. This issue has sparked different views among some committee members. Some say it is a serious problem, while others think it is not a big deal. My personal view is that this issue is indeed not a big deal, but today we are walking the socialist path, and these children about to drop out of school and young people without opportunities are the successors of socialist construction. If we do not promptly find ways to solve the problem, this issue, which was originally considered insignificant, will become serious.

    If this problem is not addressed, I believe it will lead to three undesirable consequences:

    First, since liberation, due to the influence of changes in the social system and under the education of the Party, China's children and young people are full of vigor and hope to participate in the construction of the motherland in the future. Except for a few with relatively serious shortcomings in their thinking and behavior, the vast majority study hard and strive for progress. Therefore, once they know they cannot continue their studies or have no opportunities, they will inevitably fall into negativity, depression, and dissatisfaction.

    Second, it is still early spring, and many parents are already anxious about their children's education. If their children really cannot continue their studies or have no opportunities after the summer vacation, to what extent will their anxiety reach? I think they will not only feel disappointed, but what will make them feel even more painful is that they cannot afford the burden of their children's long-term living expenses. Family life is affected, and parents' work efficiency will be reduced, causing significant losses to the country.

    Third, if there are more idle people in society, it will inevitably affect social tranquility and order. Currently, public security organs have already discovered many children and young people engaged in theft, fraud, and gangster organizations. If a large number of children and young people are not properly arranged after the summer vacation, the situation at that time can be imagined.

    To prevent these adverse consequences, we must solve the problem of further education for higher primary graduates and opportunities for young people very well. I think this issue should be handled separately. Junior high graduates, unless their parents can find other ways to arrange for them, should be assigned by the government to factories, mines, other enterprises, handicraft cooperatives, service industries, etc., to become apprentices and participate in agricultural production, regardless of whether they are in urban or rural areas. Working hours should be shorter than those of adults, and the remaining time should be spent attending evening schools to learn technical theory, politics, current affairs, and other education. These evening schools should be jointly managed by relevant units and the Party, government, labor union, and youth league.

    Regarding the issue of further education for higher primary graduates and opportunities for senior high graduates, I think these two issues can be resolved simultaneously. The solution is to mobilize senior high graduates who cannot continue their studies to become teachers for higher primary children, and at the same time, mobilize the masses above the county and town level to vigorously establish cultural supplementary schools at the junior high level. In addition, unemployed intellectuals in society can be hired to serve in school administrative management or to supplement the shortage of teachers.

    Are there any difficulties in such an arrangement? My answer is "yes." Can it be overcome? My answer is "yes."

    First, let us see if the masses can be mobilized. The following example can answer this question. During the Anti-Japanese War, Chinese women began to turn from the family to society to make a living. At that time, to meet the needs of these women and their children, some enthusiastic women's groups and individuals began to establish nurseries. After liberation, due to the correctness of the Party and the government's policies towards women, tens of thousands of urban women and a larger number of rural women have taken up jobs. During this period, the need for nurseries became even greater than before. To help women achieve complete liberation and participate in the socialist construction of the motherland and to provide children with appropriate education, the All-China Women's Federation issued a call, and through the promotion of women's federations at all levels, a wave of privately run nurseries was launched across the country, demonstrating the great power of the women's masses.

    As far as I know, there are more than eighty privately run nurseries in Chengdu, more than one hundred in Chongqing, and more than one thousand in Shanghai. The total number nationwide is over ten thousand. Many other regions have made plans to double the original figures by the end of this year. The benefits that these nurseries bring to society are not only that women can work with peace of mind and that young children receive appropriate education, that the streets and alleys are quieter, and that there are fewer accidents in transportation, but also that they help the government solve the labor employment problem for some women. For example, Shanghai has one thousand nurseries, and each nursery employs an average of three administrative and childcare personnel, which solves the labor employment problem for three thousand women. As you all know, Chinese women had little economic power in the past. After liberation, although many women have taken up jobs, the vast majority of their income can only maintain their own and their families' lives. If women with weak financial resources have been able to exert such great power, is there no other group in our country with the same enthusiasm and service spirit? The key is whether the relevant departments of the government can issue a strong call, whether they can unite the existing forces in society, such as democratic parties, people's organizations, and enthusiastic people, to promote it together, and whether they can make the masses realize that running schools is to assist the government in cultivating a new generation and is a glorious political task.

    The lack of teachers is another problem, which I don't think should be a difficulty. Intellectuals in society, like the people of the whole country, have a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm. As long as the relevant departments issue a strong call, I believe they will respond enthusiastically, and at the same time, they can solve their own depression of unemployment while participating in the work of educating children. As for young people, that shouldn't be a problem. In recent years, they have received the utmost care and cultivation from the motherland. Now is the time for them to serve the motherland, and serving the country does not necessarily mean being on the battlefield. Many of them are Party and League members, and these Party and League members should take the lead. Moreover, being a teacher for children is an excellent opportunity for young people to exercise themselves. By reviewing the old and learning the new and being responsible for the children, they can lay a solid foundation for future education or employment.

    Regarding how to utilize vacant houses, whether teachers should be given short-term teacher training, and how to set up a cultural supplementary school, I will add more when I have the opportunity in the future. If we want to take on this task, we must achieve "making the best use of people's talents and making the best use of everything," running schools frugally, and solving problems.

    Finally, I want to say that I offer these opinions with full confidence and belief in the power of the masses. For more than seven years since liberation, thanks to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Party, and the government, we have created many miracles. In the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, we defeated enemies with superior weapons; in transportation, we can cross high mountains and reach remote borders, and turn disastrous rivers into people's water conservancy; in the international arena, an ancient country once known as the "Sick Man of East Asia" has leaped to become a first-class power in the world. These brilliant achievements show that as long as everyone attaches importance to this issue, as long as we can mobilize all forces related to it, let alone the problem of further education for these higher primary children and the opportunities for junior high and senior high graduates can be successfully resolved, even greater difficulties can be overcome.

    及时设法解决他们的出路问题
    刘王立明就高小毕业生的升学和青少年的出路问题提出建议
    在听了各位首长和委员们的报告、发言以后，我要就“统筹兼顾、适当安排”有关高小毕业生的升学和青少年的出路问题提供一些意见。据说今年暑假以后，因为学校的名额有限，全国将有许多高小、初中和高中毕业生没有地方升学。这个问题曾在部分委员中引起了不同的看法。有的说这是一个严重的问题，有的认为这算不了什么。我个人的看法是：这个问题的确算不得什么，但是我们今天走的是社会主义的道路，而这班行将失学的儿童和没有出路的青少年正是社会主义建设的接班人，如果我们不及时设法把问题解决，这个原认为算不了什么的问题，也就会变成严重了。
    这个问题如不设法解决，我认为会引起三个不好的后果：
    第一，解放以来，由于社会制度变迁的影响，在党的教育下，我国儿童和青少年都是朝气勃勃，热望着将来能参加祖国的建设。他们中间除了少数的思想和行为有比较的严重缺点外，极大多数是用功念书，力求上进的，因此，一旦他们知道了不能升学和没有出路，在心情上，他们将一定会沦于消极、苦闷和不满。
    第二，现在还是初春，就有许多家长在为他们的孩子们的升学问题焦虑，如果暑假后他们的孩子们真的不能升学和没有出路，那他们的焦虑将要达到怎么样的程度呢？我想他们不仅会感到失望，而更感痛苦的将是他们掮不起孩子们长期生活的负担。家庭生活受到了影响，父母们的工作效率就会降低，使国家蒙受重大的损失。
    第三，社会上游手好闲的人多了，就必然会影响社会的安宁和秩序。就目前来说，公安机关就已发现不少儿童和青少年有偷窃、行骗行为和流氓组织，如果在暑假后大批的儿童和青少年不能好好地安排，那时的情景就可以想像而知了。
    为了防止这些不良后果的产生，我们必须很好来解决高小毕业生的升学和青少年的出路问题。关于这个问题，我以为应该分别来处理。初中毕业生，除非他们的家长能另想办法安排者外，不论在城市或乡村，应一律由政府分配到厂、矿、其他企业、手工业合作社、服务性等行业去当学徒和参加农业生产。工作时间要较成年人的缩短，其余的时间，则上业余学校去学习技术理论、政治、时事等教育，而这些业余学校应由有关单位和党、政、工、团共同负责办理。
    关于高小毕业生的升学和高中毕业生的出路，我认为这两个问题可以同时解决。解决的办法就是发动不能升学的高中毕业青年，来作高小毕业儿童的老师，同时发动县镇以上的群众，大力地来开办初中程度的文化补习学校。此外，还可以聘请社会里尚未就业的知识分子，来担任学校行政管理工作或补充老师的不足。
    这样的安排，有没有困难呢？我的回答是“有”。能不能克服呢？我的回答是“能”。
    首先让我们看一看群众能不能发动。下面的例子就可以回答这个问题。抗日期间，我国妇女已开始日多一日地由家庭转向社会谋生。那时为适应这些妇女和她们的孩子们的需要，一些热心的妇女团体和个人，便开始创办了托儿所。解放后，由于党和政府对妇女政策的正确，成千上万的城市妇女和更大数目的农村妇女，都走上了工作岗位。在这个时期，托儿所的需要，也就比以前更大了。为协助妇女获得彻底解放及参加祖国社会主义建设和给予儿童适当的教养，全国妇联发出了号召，透过各级妇联的推动，在全国范围内，掀起了一个民办托儿所的浪潮，发挥了妇女群众巨大的力量。
    据我所知，在成都就有八十多个民办托儿所，重庆一百多个，上海一千多个，全国统计起来，总数总在万数以上。还有许多地区，已做出了计划，在今年年底以前，要把原有的数字增加一倍。这些托儿所带给社会的好处，不仅是妇女能安心工作，幼小儿童得到了适当的教养，大街小巷较为清静及交通方面少出事故，它们还协助政府解决了部分妇女的劳动就业问题。比如说，上海有一千个托儿所，平均一个托儿所雇用三个行政和保教人员，这就解决了三千个妇女的劳动就业问题。各位知道，过去中国妇女没有什么经济力量，解放后，虽有许多妇女走上了工作岗位，但是她们的收入，绝大多数只能维持自己和家人的生活。如果向来财力薄弱的妇女，能够发挥这样大的力量，难道在我们的国家里，就没有别的群众，有同样的热情和服务精神吗？关键就在政府的有关部门能不能发出一个有力的号召，能不能把社会现有的力量，如民主党派、人民团体和热心人士，联合起来，共同推进，能不能使群众认识到办学，是协助政府，培养新生的一代，是一个光荣的政治任务。
    师资缺乏是另一个问题，我认为这不应该是一个困难。社会知识分子，跟全国人民一样，有着高度的爱国热情，只要有关部门发出有力的号召，我相信他们一定会热烈地响应，而且在参加教育儿童工作的同时，还能解决本身失业的苦闷。至于青年，那更不应当成为问题。近几年来他们受到祖国无微不至的培养与照顾，这正是他们为祖国效劳的时候，而报国不一定要在战场。他们中间还有许多是党团员，这些党团员应当起带头作用。况且当儿童的老师，是青年们锻炼自己的绝好机会，在温故而知新和对儿童负责的情况下，可以为未来的升学或就业打下一个牢固的基础。
    关于如何利用空着的房屋，老师们是否应当给予短期师范训练及怎样来筹办一个文化补习学校这些问题，待将来有机会时再做补充。如果我们要把这个工作担任起来，我们就必须做到“人尽其才，物尽其用”，勤俭办学，解决问题。
    最后，我要说我提供这些意见，是满怀着信心和相信群众的力量。解放七年多来，由于毛主席、党和政府的正确领导，我们创造了许多奇迹。在抗美援朝中，我们战败了武器优越的敌人；在交通方面，我们能穿越高山，达到遥远的边疆，把灾害的江河，变成人民的水利；在国际方面，一个号称“东亚病夫”的古国，一跃而成为世界上第一等大国。这些辉煌的成就说明只要大家重视这个问题，只要能动员一切与这有关的力量，慢说这些高小儿童的升学和初中、高中毕业生的出路问题能够胜利获得解决，就是更大的困难，我们也能克服。（附图片）
