In the Neijiang Special District, 4,000 agricultural cooperatives do not need loans this year. In Jingyan County, out of more than 600 agricultural cooperatives, only two cooperatives did not take out loans last year, while this year 23.9% of the agricultural cooperatives no longer need loans.

    四川发放农业贷款
    新华社讯　四川省各地开始发放农业贷款，支援农民春耕生产。截至2月底止，已发放贷款四百九十多万元。中国农业银行四川省分行负责人对记者说：根据各地重点调查，今年，四川省需要向国家贷款的农业社数目比去年减少；一部分需要贷款的农业社，所需的贷款数额也比去年降低。内江专区今年有四千个农业社不需要贷款。井研县六百多个农业社，去年只有两个社未贷款，而今年有23.9％的农业社不再贷款。苍溪县元坝乡今年贷款数额较去年减少了55.7％。
    四川省今年春耕生产期间，实际发放的贷款资金总数比去年减少，为了使贷款能在生产上发挥更大的作用，各地银行部门在发放贷款的同时，都与有关部门取得联系，组织物资配合供应。遂宁专区各地采取“四结合”的办法，将贷款、农业社自有资金、预购农产品订金和生产资料供应相互结合，统一运用，作到增产节约、勤俭办社。
