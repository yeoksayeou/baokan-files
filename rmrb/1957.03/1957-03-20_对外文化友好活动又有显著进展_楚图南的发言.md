I fully agree with Chairman Zhou Enlai's report and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report. Now I would like to make a speech on the Chinese people's foreign cultural work, and I welcome your corrections.

    **Visited Three Vast Regions with Little Past Cultural Contact**

Since the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China, our great motherland has emerged as a force for maintaining and consolidating world peace. The Chinese people, with the desire for friendship with people of all countries, have engaged in extensive friendly relations and cultural exchanges with them. Thanks to the support, assistance, and joint efforts of all parties over the past few years, we have achieved significant results in foreign cultural work. In 1956, we made further progress on the basis of our past work. In that year, we sent a total of approximately 138 cultural and artistic delegations or individual representatives, totaling 4,015 people, to 37 countries. We also invited approximately 284 cultural and artistic delegations or individual representatives from 39 countries, totaling 1,785 people, to visit China. Other activities such as the exchange and translation of books and materials, the mutual screening of films, and the mutual exhibition of exhibitions generally achieved certain results. Among them, when we commemorated twelve world cultural figures, we established contact with some cultural figures and other people concerned in relevant countries. When we held the 20th anniversary of Lu Xun's death, we invited representatives from the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries, and eighteen representatives from the literary and art circles of nine countries including Japan, India, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, and Guatemala to participate. We also participated in seven international conferences including international film script creation, Esperanto, the European Cultural Association, and the Ceramic Society. This has gradually developed our cultural exchange work into professional contacts and mutual learning. In addition, a more prominent aspect of our work this year was that, in addition to visiting West Germany and Austria in Europe and Japan and Afghanistan in Asia, the Chinese Art Troupe also visited distant Africa and the Middle East, four countries in Latin America, and the Australia and New Zealand region. These are regions with which we have had little cultural contact or little contact between people in the past. Through the visits of these art troupes, we have enhanced the understanding of the new China among the people of various countries in these three vast regions, promoted friendship and cultural and artistic exchanges and contacts between people, and also comforted the Chinese compatriots in these countries. The impact is far-reaching.

    **In Africa and the Middle East**

The art troupe that visited African and Middle Eastern countries successively visited the Republic of Egypt, the Republic of Sudan, the Kingdom of Ethiopia, the Syrian Republic, and the Lebanese Republic. It performed a total of 54 shows, with an audience of more than 76,000 people. China's excellent national cultural traditions and rich and colorful folk arts were appreciated and highly evaluated by the people of African and Middle Eastern countries who are maintaining their national independence and loving their national cultural traditions. For example, Egyptian President Nasser once said to the leader of our art troupe after watching the performance of the art troupe: "I admire the Chinese art for maintaining its beautiful national style and rich oriental flavor." Of course, we also learned the excellent national songs and dances of the Arab countries and made friends with cultural figures and artists from various countries. We believe that through these cultural and artistic contacts, the mutual understanding and friendship between our country and the people of these countries will be further deepened. Not to mention that the Chinese people, having suffered from long-term colonialism, naturally deeply sympathize with all struggles against colonialism and for maintaining independence. The Chinese people will always stand with the Arab people who are striving for independence, freedom, and progress with friendship and respect.

    **In Australia and New Zealand**

The artists of the Chinese Art Troupe who visited Australia and New Zealand always described the warm spring in the southern hemisphere to describe the warm welcome and reception they received from the vast number of people in the two countries. They were invited to visit nine cities in New Zealand and Australia, performing a total of 75 shows, with an audience of approximately 120,000 people. The audience on television in Australia twice was approximately 1.5 million people. This was the first time that a Chinese art troupe had visited and performed in Australia and New Zealand. The enthusiasm and hospitality of the people of the two countries, their sincere desire for world peace, and their praise for Chinese classical art and folk songs and dances, and their further understanding of the Chinese people's willingness to coexist peacefully with the people of all countries and to enhance mutual understanding and friendship can generally be seen from the reflections in the newspapers, magazines, and radio commentaries of the two countries. As some friends in Australia said: "The Australian media has never been consistent on any issue or any matter. However, the enthusiastic support and praise for the Chinese Art Troupe is completely consistent. This has never happened in our history." If this is not regarded as an excessive compliment from friends to our art, it at least shows the profound friendship of the Australian people towards the Chinese people. This is worth cherishing and valuing. The Chinese people are friendly to the people of Australia and New Zealand. We believe that no force can prevent the further development of friendly relations between the Chinese, Australian, and New Zealand people.

    **In South America**

The Chinese Art Troupe that visited South America visited and performed in five major cities including Santiago, Montevideo, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Buenos Aires in four countries: Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, and Argentina. We performed a total of 58 shows, and were also invited to broadcast and television. We directly contacted representative figures from all walks of life in these countries, held friendly talks with cultural and artistic figures, and also met with the vast number of people in these cities. Through the performances of Chinese classical opera and folk songs and dances and activities such as forums, visits, lectures, and reports, we specifically and vividly introduced Chinese art with a long tradition and rich and colorful content, introduced China's literary and artistic policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," and expressed the Chinese people's desire to be friendly with the people of all countries and to coexist peacefully with the people of all countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This has received good response and wide impact in all aspects. We were warmly welcomed everywhere, encountered sincere friendship everywhere, and also felt everywhere the power of the vast number of peace-loving and progressive people who demand to create their own beautiful and happy life and to master their own destiny and are willing to enhance their understanding and friendship with the Chinese people. As a Brazilian friend said after describing a performance to a large crowd of 25,000 people: "Thousands of people gathered together, warmly and friendly welcomed the envoys of ancient but young and creative Chinese art, welcomed the representatives sent by the great Chinese people who have been permanently freed from the shackles of oppression." He also said: "Through the visit of Chinese artists, the Brazilian people were able to express their love, admiration, and support for China. The Chinese artists were able to fully appreciate the love they received and were also able to express the Chinese people's attention and concern for our people." These words not only appropriately explained the significance of our visit and performance, but also made us deeply realize that the warm welcome and honor we received was given by the people of all countries to the creators of China's rich and long history and culture and art and new life and new hopes, our great motherland, and the great Chinese people.

Therefore, foreign cultural and friendly work has made progress in the past year. In particular, the three art troupes visited the three most distant new regions, enhanced mutual understanding and friendship with the people of many countries in these regions, and had preliminary contact and mutual learning with the culture and art of these countries. This good start is extremely important for maintaining and enhancing cultural and friendly relations with the people of these countries in the future.

    **In Future Foreign Cultural Activities, Attention Should Be Paid to Learning from the Visited Countries and Better Introducing Our Country's Culture and Art**

However, due to our lack of experience, there are still many shortcomings and waste in our work. Our work is still at a general stage and is somewhat superficial. As Chairman Zhou Enlai mentioned in his report on visiting eleven countries in Europe and Asia, seeking friendship, seeking peace, and seeking knowledge, for us, especially in seeking knowledge, we have not done enough. We have not paid sufficient attention to learning and exchanging advanced, useful culture, science, and technology from various countries in professional exchanges.

Based on the above experiences and lessons, our future work should be further deepened and improved in terms of quality. In our work, especially when visiting abroad, we deeply realized that due to the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the great achievements of China's socialist construction and the unprecedented improvement of its international status, China's long-standing, rich, and colorful culture and art have also been praised and valued by the people of various countries. In recent years, the publishing circles in Europe and the United States seem to be very popular with books introducing Chinese culture, art, and social life. European sinologists also appear to be active, and in 1955, they also held an international sinology conference. The Five Classics and the works of the Masters, the poems of Li Bai and Du Fu, and the abridged and old translations of several classical novels can be seen everywhere in bookstores, and people from all walks of life often talk about them with great interest. A film company in Japan, it is said, is also planning to produce a color film introducing the classical music and songs and dances that were introduced to Japan from China during the Tang Dynasty. In addition, there are countless books, articles, and writings translated, introduced, published, and commented on Chinese culture and art by friends who are friendly to China, just like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. This shows the deep desire of the people of various countries to understand and be friendly to the Chinese people. This is natural, because the brilliant achievements of the new China in all aspects attract people's attention, so all departments of Chinese academic thought and literature and art of past dynasties, such as poetry, novels, music, drama, sculpture, painting, and arts and crafts, have an extremely rich and diverse content and different levels, which makes the people of various countries have a very deep interest. Any foreign writer or scholar, as long as they have a sincere goodwill and strive to engage in this work to meet the wishes and requirements of the people of various countries, is worthy of our respect and gratitude. But as the liberated Chinese people, as the inheritors of the unparalleled excellent and abundant wisdom and creation of the great Chinese working people, as the inheritors of the long-standing and rich Chinese culture and academic thought, we have a solemn responsibility to gradually create conditions, organize forces, sort out and study the Chinese national culture and art traditions, and plan and selectively promote and introduce them to the people of various countries. To make our culture and art make more and more beneficial contributions to the people of various countries and to the culture of mankind, and also increase the understanding of the people of various countries of our people and expand the influence of our people. We should have an extremely humble attitude and extremely devout efforts to let the cultural and peaceful brilliant flowers of China's five thousand years of history and 600 million people bloom not only in China, but also throughout the world. On the other hand, we also deeply realize that the people of every country have created their own excellent national cultural traditions and construction achievements with their unique wisdom and creative labor. There are quite a few that are worth our reference and worth our learning. To create our socialist national new culture, in addition to inheriting and carrying forward our excellent cultural heritage, we must also absorb and apply all advanced or useful cultural knowledge from foreign countries. Only in this way can it help enrich the content of our culture and promote the progress of our culture. Therefore, while enhancing the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of all countries, strengthening professional cultural activities and deeply learning all useful cultural knowledge from foreign countries will become an extremely important topic in our foreign cultural work. Like the amine tree oil experts and neurosurgery experts from Australia who visited us in the past year, we learned a lot of knowledge. The Chinese cultural delegation that visited Europe learned about the atomic energy research of some European countries. Some art troupes also strived to learn the music, songs, and dances of the countries they visited. Although there are not many examples, this is always worth paying attention to and encouraging. Our ancestors were not only creative experts in cultural undertakings, but also learning experts. We should inherit and carry forward their excellent traditions and brilliant examples, and in an organized and planned way, combine with China's reality, introduce, absorb, learn, and apply all advanced and useful cultural knowledge of the people of various countries. This can not only make our culture constantly grow, enrich, and progress, but also make a certain contribution to our great socialist construction cause. This requires comrades who care about this work and participate in this work to give us guidance and criticism and work hard with us. Our scope of work is broad, and our prospects are infinitely brilliant. I believe that with the assistance of comrades from all aspects and the support of the people of the whole country, our tasks can be gradually completed, and our hopes can be gradually realized.

### 对外文化友好活动又有显著进展  楚图南的发言

专栏：

    对外文化友好活动又有显著进展
    楚图南的发言
    我完全同意周恩来主席的报告和陈叔通副主席的工作报告。现在我就中国人民对外文化工作作一个发言，请各位指正。
    访问了过去很少有文化联系
    的三个广大地区
    我国自人民革命胜利、中华人民共和国成立的时候起，我们伟大的祖国就作为维护和巩固世界和平的力量出现于世界；中国人民就怀着和各国人民友好的愿望同各国人民进行了广泛的友好联系和文化交流工作。几年来由于各方面的支持、协助和共同努力，我们在对外文化工作方面获得了显著的成绩。在1956年，我们更在过去工作的基础上，取得了进一步的开展。这一年我们共派出文化艺术代表团或个人代表约一百三十八起四千零一十五人到了三十七个国家。也邀请了三十九个国家的文化艺术代表团或个人代表约二百八十四起共一千七百八十五人来中国访问。其余如书刊资料的交换和翻译、出版，电影的相互放映和展览会的相互展出，以及多种多样的活动，一般都取得了一定的效果。就中我们在分别纪念世界十二位文化名人的时候，曾经和有关国家的一些文化界人士和其他方面人士取得联系。我们举行鲁迅逝世二十周年纪念，邀请了苏联、人民民主国家的代表和日本、印度、巴基斯坦、英国、澳大利亚、意大利、危地马拉等九个国家的十八位文艺界的代表参加。我们也参加了国际电影剧本创作、世界语、欧洲文化协会、陶瓷学会等七个国际性的会议。这使我们的文化交流工作，逐渐的发展到专业性质的联系和相互学习。此外，我们在这一年来的工作中，较为突出的，则是中国艺术团除了访问欧洲的西德、奥地利和亚洲的日本、阿富汗以外，还分别访问了遥远的非洲和中近东各国、拉丁美洲的四个国家和澳大利亚、新西兰地区。这些地区是我们过去很少有文化联系或人民之间很少有接触的地区。通过了这几个艺术团的访问，增进了这三个广大地区各国人民对于新中国的了解，增进了人民与人民之间的友谊和文化艺术的交流与联系，也慰问了在这些国家的中国侨胞。其影响是很深远的。
    在非洲和中近东
    访问非洲和中近东各国的艺术团，先后访问了埃及共和国、苏丹共和国、埃塞俄比亚王国、叙利亚共和国和黎巴嫩共和国。共演出五十四场，观众达七万六千多人。我国的优秀的民族文化传统和丰富多采的民间艺术得到正在维护自己的民族独立和热爱自己的民族文化传统的非洲和中近东各国人民的赞赏，获到了很高的评价。如埃及纳赛尔总统在看了艺术团的演出后就曾经对我艺术团的领导人说过：“我很钦佩中国艺术保持着优美的民族风格和丰富的东方色彩。”当然我们也学习了阿拉伯各国人民的优秀的民族歌舞，和各国的文化界、艺术家交了朋友。我们相信通过这些文化艺术上的接触，将会进一步的加深我国和这些国家人民之间的相互了解和友谊。更不要说中国人民因为身受过长期的殖民主义的灾害，因此中国人民很自然地深切同情一切反对殖民主义和维护独立的斗争。对于争取独立自由和进步的阿拉伯各国人民，中国人民将是永远怀着友谊和敬意和他们站在一起的。
    在澳洲和新西兰
    访问澳大利亚和新西兰的中国艺术团的艺术家们总是以南国的美丽而温暖的春天来形容他们在两个国家受到广大人民的热情欢迎和接待。他们应邀访问了新西兰和澳大利亚的九个城市，共演出七十五场，观众约十二万多人。在澳大利亚两次电视的观众约一百五十万人。这是中国艺术团第一次到澳、新两国访问演出。两国人民的热情好客和对世界和平的真诚愿望，和对于中国古典艺术和民间歌舞的称赞，对于中国人民愿意与各国人民和平共处和相互增进了解和友谊的进一步的认识，一般的可以从两国的报纸、杂志和广播评论的反映中看得出来。这正如澳大利亚的一部分朋友们所说的：“澳大利亚的舆论界在任何问题和任何事情上从来没有一致过。但是对中国艺术团的热烈支持和称赞，则是完全一致的。这在我国历史上是从来没有过的事情。”这话如果不是看作朋友们对于我国艺术的过分奖赞，至少是说明了澳大利亚人民对中国人民的深厚友谊。这是值得我们珍惜和重视的。中国人民对澳、新两国人民是友好的。我们相信没有任何力量能够阻止中、澳、新三国人民友好关系的进一步的发展。在南美
    访问南美洲的中国艺术团，先后到了智利、乌拉圭、巴西和阿根廷四个国家的圣地亚哥、蒙得维的亚、里约热内卢、圣保罗和布宜诺斯艾利斯等五个大城市访问演出。我们共演出了五十八场，有时也应邀作了广播和电视。我们直接接触了这几个国家的社会各阶层的有代表性的人物，和文化艺术界的人士进行了友谊的接谈，也和这几个城市的广大的人民见了面。我们通过中国古典戏曲和民间歌舞等艺术的演出和座谈、访问、演讲、报告等活动，具体而生动地介绍了有着悠久传统和丰富多采的中国艺术，介绍了中国“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的文艺方针，表达了中国人民和各国人民友好和根据五项原则同各国人民和平共处的愿望。这在各方面都得到良好的反映和广泛的影响。我们到处受到热烈的欢迎，到处遇到真挚的友谊，也到处体会到爱好和平和进步的广大人民，要求创造自己的美好幸福的生活和掌握自己的命运以及愿意增进对于中国人民的了解和友谊的力量。这正如一位巴西朋友在叙述一次对二万五千人广大群众的演出后所说的：“成千上万聚集在一起的人们，热烈而友好的欢迎古老但又年青而富有创造性的中国艺术使节们，欢迎永远摆脱了压迫枷锁的伟大中国人民派来的代表。”又说：“通过中国艺术家的访问，巴西人民得以表达他们对中国的热爱、钦佩和支援。中国艺术家们能够充分体会到他们所受到的热爱而且也能表达了中国人民对我国人民的重视和关心。”这些话不仅恰当地说明了我们访问演出的意义，也使我们很深的认识到我们所受到的热烈欢迎和荣誉乃是各国人民给与中国丰富悠久的历史与文化艺术和新生活与新希望的创造者、我们伟大的祖国和伟大的中国人民的。
    所以一年来的对外文化友好工作是有着进展的。特别是三个艺术团访问了三个最为遥远的新的地区，和这些地区的许多国家的人民增进了相互的了解和友谊，和这些国家的文化艺术有了初步的接触和相互的学习。这一良好的开端，对于今后继续和这些国家的人民保持和增进文化友好关系，是极为重要的。
    在今后的对外文化活动中，
    应当注意向被访问的国家学习，
    并更好地介绍我国的文化艺术
    但在工作中由于我们经验不足，仍然存在着许多缺点和浪费现象。我们的工作还停留在一般性的阶段和多少有些浮在表面上。周恩来主席在访问欧亚十一国的报告中所提到的寻求友谊、寻求和平、寻求知识，对我们说来，特别是在寻求知识方面我们是做得极不够的。我们对于专业性质的来往还没有充分认真地注意到向各国先进的、对我有用的文化、科学、技术的学习和交流。
    接受了上面的经验教训，我们今后的工作，还应该从质量上进一步地深入和提高。我们在工作中，特别是在出国访问的时候，深深地体会到由于我国人民革命胜利和我国社会主义建设的伟大成就和国际地位的空前提高，因此我国历史悠久、丰富多采的文化艺术也受到各国人民的称赞和重视。最近几年来欧美各国的出版界有关介绍中国的文化艺术和社会生活的书籍，似乎很风行。欧洲的汉学家，也显得活跃，在1955年，且召开了国际性的汉学家会议。中国五经诸子，李白、杜甫的诗歌和几部古典小说的节译本和旧译本在书店中到处都可以看到，所遇到的各界人士，也经常津津有味的谈说着。东方日本的一家影片公司，据说也在计划生产一部彩色影片，介绍我国唐代传到日本去的古典音乐和歌舞。此外对中国友好的朋友们翻译、介绍、出版评论中国文化艺术的书刊、文字更是多得如同雨后春笋，不胜列举。这说明了各国人民要求了解和对中国人民友好的深切愿望。这是当然的，由于新中国在各方面的光辉成就，吸引人们的重视，因此中国历代的学术思想和文学艺术的各个部门如诗歌、小说、音乐、戏剧、雕刻、绘画、工艺美术各方面都以无比丰富多样的内容和不同的水平，使各国人民有着极深厚的兴趣。任何一个外国的文人学者，只要是怀着一种真诚的善意，努力从事这方面的工作，满足各国人民的愿望和要求，都是值得我们敬佩、值得我们感谢的。但作为解放了的中国人民，作为伟大的中国劳动人民的无比优秀和丰饶的智慧和创造的继承者，作为历史悠久、丰富多采的中国文化学术的继承者，我们就有着一种庄严的责任，要逐渐创造条件、组织力量、整理和研究中国的民族文化艺术传统，并有计划、有选择的推广和介绍给各国人民。使我国的文化艺术对各国人民、对人类的文化作出更多、更有益的贡献，同时也增加了各国人民对我国人民的理解和扩大我国人民的影响。我们应该怀着极谦逊的心情和极虔诚的努力，让中国五千年历史和六亿人民的文化与和平的光辉灿烂的花朵不仅在中国境内开放，也在世界范围内开放。另一方面，我们也深深地体会到，每一个国家的人民，都以他们独特的智慧和创造性的劳动，创造了自己的优秀的民族文化传统和建设成就。颇有不少值得我们参考，值得我们学习的。我们要创造我们社会主义的民族的新文化，除了继承和发扬我国优秀的文化遗产，同时也要吸收和应用外国的一切先进的或有益的文化知识。这样才能有助于丰富我国文化的内容和促使我国文化的进步。所以在增进中国人民和各国人民的友谊的同时，加强专业性质的文化活动和深入学习外国一切有益的文化知识，将成为我们对外文化工作中的一项极为重要的课题。像一年来我们从澳大利亚来访的胺树油专家及脑神经学专家学到许多知识，我国到欧洲去访问的文化代表团了解了欧洲有些国家的原子能研究的情况，还有一些艺术团争取学习了所访问国家的音乐、歌曲和舞蹈，虽例子不多，但这总是值得重视、值得鼓励的。我们的祖先在文化事业上不仅是创造的能手，也同样是学习的能手。我们应继承和发扬他们的优秀传统和光辉典范，有组织、有计划的结合中国实际，分别介绍、吸收、学习和应用各国人民的一切先进的和有用的文化知识。这不仅可以使我国文化不断的壮大、丰饶和进步，也将对我国伟大的社会主义建设事业作出一定的贡献。这就需要关心这一工作和参加这一工作的同志们经常给我们以指导、批评并和我们一道努力。我们的工作范围是广阔的，我们的工作远景是无限辉煌的。我相信在各方面同志们的协助和全国人民的支持下，我们的任务是可以逐步完成，我们的希望是可以逐步实现的。
