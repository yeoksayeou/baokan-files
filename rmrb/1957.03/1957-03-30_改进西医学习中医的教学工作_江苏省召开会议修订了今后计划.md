Improving the Teaching of Western Medicine Practitioners Studying Traditional Chinese Medicine
Jiangsu Province Holds Meeting and Revises Future Plans

　　This Dispatch: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Public Health recently convened a working conference on Western medicine practitioners studying Traditional Chinese Medicine. The conference summarized the teaching experiences of Western medicine practitioners studying Traditional Chinese Medicine classes in various locations and studied and revised future teaching plans. Based on the summary of work, and in accordance with the central government's policy of "systematic study, comprehensive mastery, and summarization and improvement," it was considered that the purpose and requirements of future teaching should be: "Through systematic study, to basically understand the spiritual essence and treatment principles and methods of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and to lay the foundation for further study and research of traditional Chinese medicine." Regarding teaching time and procedures, in addition to "Essentials of the Inner Classic" still being carried out according to the original plan, "Treatise on Cold Damage" is temporarily set at 75 hours, "Synopsis of the Golden Chamber" at 57 hours, "Warm Diseases" at 18 hours, and "Materia Medica Classic" at 12 hours. The order of explanation of the Materia Medica Classic and the use of class hours for other courses will be determined according to the circumstances and will not be rigidly stipulated. In this way, the entire teaching time will be shortened by one-third, selecting the essence to explain, which will be of great benefit to improving teaching quality.
    The meeting held that when explaining theory, examples should be cited in conjunction with clinical practice, but one-sided emphasis on clinical practice should be prevented; tutoring work should be carried out in a planned manner under the unified leadership of the teaching and research group.

　　改进西医学习中医的教学工作
　　江苏省召开会议修订了今后计划
    本报讯  江苏省卫生厅最近召开西医学习中医工作会议，总结了各地西医学习中医班的教学经验，研究修订了今后的教学计划。在总结工作基础上，根据中央所规定的“系统学习，全面掌握，加以整理提高”的方针，认为今后教学的目的和要求应该是：“通过系统学习，基本上理解中医学术的精神实质及治疗原则和方法，为进一步学习和研究祖国医学打下基础。”关于教学时间和程序，除“内经知要”仍按原订计划进行外，“伤寒论”暂定七十五小时、“金匮要略”五十七小时、“温病”十八小时、“本草经”十二小时。本草经讲解的先后以及其他课程学时的运用，视情况而定，不作硬性规定。这样，整个教学时间将缩短三分之一，择精而讲，对提高教学质量有很大好处。
    会议认为，讲解理论时应举实例结合临床，但要防止片面强调临床；辅导工作应在教研组的统一领导下有计划的进行。
