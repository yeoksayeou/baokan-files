Improving the Teaching Work of Secondary Vocational Schools
Zhao Ji

Currently, there are more than 700 secondary vocational schools in the country, offering 250 majors, with a total of 540,000 students. Secondary vocational schools undertake the task of training intermediate technical cadres and various professional cadres for the country, playing an important role in national construction. Since the founding of the country, secondary vocational schools have graduated more than 300,000 students, many of whom have become the backbone of technical cadres. Many industrial and mining enterprises reflect that the quality of students graduating from secondary vocational schools in the past two or three years has improved, and their professional knowledge can basically meet the needs of production. However, many industrial departments and industrial and mining enterprises also pointed out that intermediate technical cadres and professional cadres still cannot well adapt to the needs of various production enterprise departments. On the one hand, the scope of professional knowledge mastered by some graduates is somewhat narrow; on the other hand, graduates are not proficient enough in technological operations and have poor independent working ability.

From the perspective of teaching work and students' learning, students have a heavy learning burden, and it is difficult to master knowledge to a solid and proficient degree. This phenomenon is common and the problem is serious. In the past, although many schools have paid attention to reducing the excessive learning burden of students, this situation has not been completely improved.

Another problem in teaching is that the connection with production practice is not done well enough. In addition to such problems in professional settings, teaching plans, and teaching syllabuses, the relationship between schools and factories and mines is generally not close enough, and experiments and internships cannot be guaranteed to meet the requirements of teaching, which is very important for improving teaching quality. Establishing close ties between schools and factories and mines is one of the important conditions for connecting with reality and doing a good job in teaching. Now some schools are concentrated in large cities far away from factories and mines, which is unreasonable.

At present, school leaders cannot concentrate their efforts on leading teaching work and political and ideological work; the time for teachers to study teaching business has not been well guaranteed. The main reason for the above phenomenon, I think, is that there is still subjectivism and bureaucratism in the work of the education department itself. Leading organs often fail to proceed from reality when arranging work, do not carefully consider the specific situation, and lack explanation and specific organization work. Various rules and regulations are generally promoted universally and required uniformly; the regulations for schools to take certain measures to improve teaching work are often just orders, and there is a lack of specific leadership in school teaching work; schools cannot get instructions and assistance from the leading organs in time when difficulties and problems occur in their work.

56% of secondary vocational school teachers have not reached the level of university graduation; professional course teachers generally lack practical experience in production; more than two-thirds of professional courses (about 1,400) do not have textbooks. This has a decisive relationship on the guarantee and improvement of teaching quality.

Now, the Ministry of Higher Education and the education divisions and bureaus of the central business departments, and various schools are summarizing the experience of teaching reform in secondary vocational schools, and are preparing to propose improvement measures. The direction of improving the teaching work of secondary vocational schools should be: correctly implement the policy of "learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and combining it with the actual situation in China," and overcome subjectivism and dogmatism. We must more humbly study the experience of the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, especially the reforms made by the Soviet Union in secondary vocational education recently, and at the same time, we must more closely combine with the actual situation in China and creatively apply the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In order to ensure the quality of cadre training and adapt to various different situations and needs, appropriate flexibility should be added to the existing unity; vigorous efforts should be made to train and improve the professional level of teachers and organize the compilation and publication of teaching materials.

The central issue of improving teaching work is how to combine theory with practice and improve the quality of cadre training. In the past, secondary vocational schools learned from the experience of the Soviet Union and achieved great results. However, in the past, secondary vocational schools had some shortcomings in learning from the Soviet Union's experience, such as mechanically copying and being divorced from reality. In the future, in teaching work, secondary vocational schools must fully consider my country's national economy and industrial and agricultural production, the quality of teachers and students, national traditional habits, and so on. In particular, sufficient attention should be paid to the two aspects of industrial and agricultural production and the quality of teachers and students. For example, should the scope of professional knowledge of technicians be wider or narrower? Small local industries generally require a technician to be able to undertake various types of technical work; many central industrial departments also require technicians to have a slightly wider range of professional knowledge. Now, many majors are divided more finely. On the one hand, it is required that the technological operation should reach a more proficient level, and on the other hand, it is required that the scope of professional knowledge should be wider. How to unify the contradiction? This problem needs to be thoroughly understood the needs of various production enterprise departments and study and solve it in combination with the current conditions of teachers and students. For example, the medical profession in health schools, the medical staff it trains can generally only assist doctors in conducting preliminary diagnosis, preliminary treatment and prevention. However, today in my country's vast rural areas, there cannot be many doctors, so medical staff are required to be able to independently diagnose and treat general diseases. The current teaching plan does not meet this requirement. How to solve this problem needs further study.

At present, the quality of teachers in my country is generally not high, the cultural and scientific knowledge foundation of junior high school graduates is poor, and the conditions of teaching materials and teaching equipment are not perfect enough. This makes the students' learning burden too heavy, and it is difficult to master knowledge to a solid and proficient degree. Under such circumstances, in order to ensure quality, in addition to trying to improve the quality of classroom teaching as much as possible, students should have more time for self-study to ensure reviewing lessons and doing exercises, and teachers should be able to have more time to prepare lessons and improve their knowledge, and provide students with more extracurricular tutoring. At the same time, according to the call of the state to increase production and practice economy, schools should be run diligently and thriftily, and overcome difficulties in school buildings, equipment, and other aspects.

The above situation shows that it is necessary to consider both the needs of combining with production practice and the combination with existing conditions. It is inappropriate to unilaterally emphasize any aspect. In addition to having a good understanding and research on my country's national economy and production practice, secondary vocational schools should also act according to national conditions and inherit beneficial traditional experience.

At present, we should seize the time to do a good job in revising the teaching plan, and through studying how to revise the teaching plan, summarize the past experience and study some problems existing in the teaching work. In addition to revising the teaching plan, we should make serious efforts in training and improving the professional level of teachers and solving teaching materials, and take some active measures.

How to improve the professional level of teachers? Judging from the specific situation of current secondary vocational school teachers, the main task is to improve their scientific and technological level. Of course, the improvement of the teaching method level should not be ignored. At present, the main ways to train and improve the professional level of teachers should be to run teacher training colleges and short-term training courses, run night universities and correspondence schools, and select teachers to go to universities for further study and to factories and mines for internships, and so on. Universities and factories and mines are of great help in improving teachers' professional knowledge. Without their help, it is difficult to train and improve secondary vocational school teachers. In order to better obtain the help of universities and factories and mines, further guarantees should be made from the organizational system. Entrusting universities to run further training courses specifically for secondary vocational schools to improve on-the-job teachers is a better way to systematically train and improve those teachers who have not reached the level of university graduation. I think it is possible to do so now.

Since the Party called on to march towards science, the enthusiasm of secondary vocational school teachers to improve their scientific and technological level has been very high, which is very good, but it has also produced a bad tendency. Some comrades feel that working in secondary vocational schools seems to limit the improvement of their scientific and technological level, and they hope to go to universities, scientific research institutions or factories to work. Although there are indeed some problems that need to be solved in the work arrangements and further studies of secondary vocational school teachers, it cannot be generally believed that it is inappropriate to arrange university graduates studying engineering to teach in secondary technical schools, and those studying literature must engage in creation and work in literary research institutes. Teachers should "march" in their own work positions, and the purpose of further studies must be to do a good job in their own positions.

In order to enable teachers' professional level to improve faster, the teaching quality can be continuously improved, and it is very necessary to ensure the stability of teachers' teaching. This requires the departments in charge of schools to try their best to make the cadre training plan more accurate and not to easily change the professional settings. Correctly solving the contradiction between quantity and quality in the development of secondary vocational education is a key issue at present.

In the past few years, the education department has not paid much attention to the work of editing and publishing textbooks, which is related to the following understanding: that is, it is believed that there are many professional courses and the production situation changes quickly, and it is impossible and unnecessary to require each course to have textbooks. This understanding now seems one-sided. It is not enough for teachers with insufficient experience to only have a teaching syllabus. The main force in editing textbooks is teachers from secondary vocational schools and engineering and technical personnel from factories and mines. University teachers can also participate in this work. Textbooks cannot be compiled in a short period of time. At present, teachers can be mobilized to compile their own lecture notes. In order to improve the quality of self-compiled lecture notes, teachers should be organized to exchange the lecture notes they have compiled, and some of the higher quality lecture notes can be gradually revised into textbooks.

    改进中等专业学校的教学工作
    赵季
    现在全国有七百多所中等专业学校，共设置了二百五十个专业，在校学生有五十四万人。中等专业学校担负着为国家培养中级技术干部和各种专业干部的任务，在国家建设中起着重要的作用。建国以来，中等专业学校毕业学生三十余万人，不少人已成为技术干部中的骨干。许多工矿企业反映，最近二、三年来中等专业学校毕业的学生质量有所提高，业务知识能基本上满足生产的需要。但是，许多产业部门和工矿企业同时提出：中级技术干部和专业干部还不能很好地适应各个生产企业部门的需要，一方面，部分毕业学生所掌握的业务知识范围，有些嫌窄；另一方面，毕业学生在工艺操作方面不够熟练，独立工作的能力较差。
    从教学工作和在校学生的学习情况来看，学生的学习负担很重，掌握知识难以达到巩固熟练的程度。这种现象是普遍的，问题是严重的。过去一个时期，许多学校虽已注意减轻学生过重的学习负担，但是这一情况还没有得到彻底改善。
    教学工作中另一个问题是联系生产实际还做得很不够。除了在专业设置、教学计划、教学大纲等方面有这样的问题外，学校同厂矿企业的关系一般还不密切，实验、实习还不能保证满足教学上的要求，这对教学质量的提高的关系很大。学校同厂矿企业取得密切联系，是联系实际，做好教学工作的重要条件之一，现在有些学校都集中设在远离厂矿企业的大城市，这是不合理的。
    目前学校领导干部还不能集中精力领导教学工作和政治思想工作；教师钻研教学业务的时间也还没有很好的得到保证。造成上述现象的主要原因，我认为还是在教育部门本身的工作存在着主观主义和官僚主义。领导机关布置工作往往不从实际出发，不好好考虑具体情况，又缺乏解释说明和具体的组织工作。各种规章制度一般都是普遍推行，一律要求；规定学校采取某种改进教学工作的措施往往是一纸命令，对学校教学工作缺乏具体领导；学校在工作中发生了困难和问题不能及时得到领导机关的指示和帮助。
    中等专业学校的教师有56％未达到高等学校毕业水平；专业课教师一般都缺乏生产的实际经验；有三分之二以上的专业课（约一千四百门）还没有教科书。这对教学质量的保证和提高有决定性的关系。
    现在，高等教育部和中央各业务部门的教育司、局，各学校正在总结中等专业学校教学改革经验，准备提出改进措施。改进中等专业学校教学工作的方向应该是：正确贯彻“学习苏联先进经验，并与中国实际相结合”的方针，克服主观主义、教条主义。要更虚心地研究苏联和人民民主国家的经验，特别是苏联最近在中等专业教育方面所作的改革，同时要更加密切地结合中国实际情况，创造性地运用苏联先进经验。为了保证培养干部的质量，适应各种不同的情况和需要，应该在已有的统一的基础上适当增加灵活性；大力抓紧培养提高教师业务水平和组织编写出版教材的工作。
    改进教学工作的中心问题是如何结合实际、提高培养干部的质量。过去，中等专业学校学习了苏联的经验，取得了很大的成绩。但是中等专业学校过去在学习苏联经验中，有一些机械照搬、脱离实际的缺点。今后中等专业学校在教学工作中，要充分考虑到我国的国民经济和工农业生产情况，教师和学生的质量，民族的传统习惯，等等。尤其是对工农业生产情况和教师学生的质量这两个方面，应当给予足够的重视。譬如培养技术员的业务知识范围，究竟是宽一点好，还是窄一点好呢？小型的地方工业一般要求一个技术员能够担任多种门类的技术工作；许多中央产业部门也要求技术员的业务知识范围稍宽一点。现在，许多专业是分得较细的。一方面要求工艺操作达到更熟练的程度，一方面又要求业务知识范围宽一点，矛盾如何统一呢？这个问题需要切实了解各个生产企业部门的需要，并结合目前教师、学生的条件研究解决。又如卫生学校的医士专业，它所培养的医士一般只能协助医生，进行初步诊断、初步治疗和预防。但是，今天我国广大的农村还不可能有很多的医生，因此要求医士能对一般性疾病独立进行诊断治疗。现行的教学计划达不到这个要求，这个问题怎样解决，需要进一步研究。
    目前我国师资质量一般还不高，初中毕业学生的文化科学知识基础较差，教材、教学设备等条件也不够完善。这就使学生的学习负担过重，掌握知识难以达到巩固和熟练的程度。在这种情况下，要保证质量，除了尽量要求提高课堂教学质量外，应使学生有较多的自习时间用以保证复习功课和做好练习，并且要使教师有可能多有一些时间备课和进修，对学生多进行一些课外辅导。同时，根据国家增产节约的号召应该勤俭办学，克服校舍、设备等各方面的困难。
    以上情况说明，既要考虑结合生产实际的需要，又要考虑结合现有条件，片面地强调任何一个方面都是不妥当的。中等专业学校除了要很好地了解和研究我国的国民经济与生产实际情况外，还应当根据国情，继承有益的传统经验办事。
    当前我们应当抓紧时间，将修订教学计划的工作做好，并通过研究如何修订教学计划，总结过去的经验，研究教学工作中存在的一些问题。除了修订教学计划之外，应在培养提高教师业务水平和解决教材这两方面认真努力的做一些工作，采取一些积极的措施。
    如何提高教师的业务水平？根据当前中等专业学校教师的具体情况看来，主要是提高他们的科学技术水平。当然，教学方法水平的提高也不应忽视。当前培养提高教师业务水平的主要方式，应当是开办教师进修学院和短期训练班，办夜大学和函授学校，选送教师去高等学校进修和去厂矿企业实习，等等。高等学校和厂矿企业对教师业务知识提高的帮助很大，离开了他们的帮助，中等专业学校教师的培养和提高是很困难的。为了更好地取得高等学校和厂矿企业的帮助，应该进一步从组织制度上加以保证。委托高等学校开办专为中等专业学校提高在职教师的进修班，是系统培养提高那些未达到高等学校毕业水平的教师的一种较好的方式，我认为现在是有可能做到的。
    自从党号召向科学进军以来，中等专业学校教师要求提高自己的科学技术水平的积极性很高，这是很好的，但是也产生了一种不好的倾向。有些同志感到在中等专业学校担任教学工作，好像会限制自己的科学技术水平的提高，希望去高等学校、科学研究机关或工厂去工作。虽然现在中等专业学校教师的工作安排和进修确实有一些问题需要解决，但总不能认为学工科的大学毕业生在中等技术学校教学就是安排不当，学文学的一定要去搞创作和去文学研究所工作。教师应当在自己的工作岗位上“进军”，进修目的必须是为了做好本岗位的工作。
    为了使教师的业务水平提高得较快，教学质量能够不断提高，保证教师任课的稳定性是十分必要的。这就需要主管学校的部门尽量做到培养干部的计划比较准确，专业设置不要轻易变动。正确地解决在发展中等专业教育中数量与质量的矛盾，是当前一个带有关键性的问题。
    过去几年，教育部门对编辑和出版教科书的工作没有很好地重视，是和这样的认识有关的：就是认为专业课门数多，生产情况变化较快，不可能也不必要要求每一门课都有教科书。这种认识，现在看来是片面的。仅仅有一份教学大纲，对于经验不足的教师来说是很不够的。编辑教科书的主要力量是中等专业学校的教师和厂矿企业的工程技术人员，高等学校的教师也可以参加这项工作。教科书不是短时期内能够编好的。目前，可以发动教师自编讲义。为了提高自编讲义的质量，应该组织交流教师们编写的讲义，并且可将一部分质量较高的讲义逐步修订成为教科书。
