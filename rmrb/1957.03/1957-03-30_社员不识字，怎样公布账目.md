Publicizing the financial income and expenditure of agricultural production cooperatives to the members is something that few people disagree with now. However, how to publicize it? There are still some difficulties and some questions. The accountant's unfamiliarity with the work and the illiteracy of many members are obstacles to implementing financial transparency. Some cadres even doubt whether financial transparency can be implemented at present because of this.

For some accountants, it takes a lot of time to calculate the accounts at any time and write them out item by item and post them, making it difficult to do it in a timely manner; after they are posted, many illiterate members have no way of knowing what is written on them. Literate members may not be able to understand the accounts, especially the new bookkeeping methods. These are indeed difficulties. However, it must not be considered that these are insurmountable difficulties, and financial transparency must not be abandoned because of this. In fact, the problem is easy to solve. The accounts and income and expenditure plans of the cooperative do not necessarily have to be written out and posted on the wall to be considered publicized, as long as they are announced orally at the members' meeting or the members' representative meeting. The labor day accounts of each member can also be read out at the members' meeting of each production team. This not only saves the time of the cooperative cadres, but also enables illiterate members to quickly understand the financial income and expenditure of the cooperative; if there are errors, it is also convenient to check them on the spot.

　　社员不识字，怎样公布账目
　　培育
    农业生产合作社的财政收支应该向社员公布，现在已经很少有人不同意了。可是，怎样公布呢？还有一些困难，还有一些疑问。会计员工作不熟练，许多社员不识字，都是实行财务公开的障碍。有些干部甚至因此而怀疑目前究竟能不能实行财务公开。
    要随时算清账目并且逐条写成文字张贴出去，对于有些会计员来说要花费很多时间，难以做到及时；公布出去之后，不少不识字的社员也没法知道上面写的是什么。识字的社员，也不一定看得懂账目，特别是新式簿记，更看不懂。这些的确都是困难。可是，决不能认为这是没法克服的困难，决不可以因此而不实行财务公开。其实，问题是很容易解决的。社里的账目和收支计划，不一定要写出来贴在墙上才算是公布了，只要在社员大会或者社员代表大会上口头公布一下就可以了。各个社员的劳动日的账目，在各个生产队的队员大会上宣读一下也就可以了。这样做，不光能节省社干部的时间，还能使不识字的社员很快了解社里的财政收支；如果有差错，也便于当场核对清楚。
