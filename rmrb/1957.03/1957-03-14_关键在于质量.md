    The Key Lies in Quality
    Sī Fāng
    One often hears discussions: there are too many works on a certain theme, and too few on another. For example, last year it was said that there were too many "writings about workers, peasants, and soldiers," and too few about other things; too many writings about production and struggle, and too few about personal daily life. This year, one hears that there are too many writings about "other things," too many about love, too many "exposing the dark side"...
    This kind of statement doesn't seem very "scientific." What is called "few" is indeed few, but what is denounced as "many" is not necessarily many.
    From a national perspective, creation still urgently needs to develop. Both in quantity and quality, it is far from meeting the needs of the people. The general situation is that our works—the better ones—are too few, not too many. Last year, everyone said there were too many scripts reflecting agricultural cooperativization, but in reality, the ones that truly stood the test of time were pitifully few. Recently, some have said that too much is being written about love, but in order to produce today's "Romance of the West Chamber" or "Dream of the Red Chamber," writers still need to work harder. Sometimes, certain themes are extremely scarce, such as reflections on school life, the lives of scientists, and science fiction. Calling out "too little is written on this theme!" to show encouragement is entirely necessary. But this "too little" does not equal that "too much." The inverse theorem does not necessarily hold true.
    Sometimes, a certain "epidemic" occurs in some works on a certain theme. For example, scripts about agricultural cooperativization fall into "templates," writings about love become "yellow," and those exposing the dark side fail to more powerfully affirm and consolidate our new society and new life. At this time, it is necessary to carefully analyze the source of the disease: whether it is formulaic conceptualization, low-level taste, or petty-bourgeois sentiment... but there is no need to frown upon a certain theme. The theme is innocent; the fault lies with the author.
    Which themes a writer writes about is not entirely determined by his subjective intentions and the well-intentioned advice of critics. Any great writer is also limited by their life experiences, talents, characteristics... and has their own "strengths" and "weaknesses." The proportion of work themes cannot be like planned production commodities, always maintaining a certain balance. On the issue of themes, let's focus more on positive articles, such as advocating writing about workers, peasants, and soldiers, advocating writing about new figures, and advocating writing about things that writers are familiar with, interested in, and feel compelled to write! Issuing accusations of "too much of this" and "too much of that" so easily will only confuse writers. In this regard, writers suffer greatly. It takes them half a year, a year, or even many years to conceive a theme, but the air released by some critics may disrupt their plans in a short time. Writers must also be cautious, think independently, and not sway back and forth with every wind.
    Let us promote writing about workers, peasants, and soldiers, and writing about new figures more! Let us focus more on the quality of the works! Let us more fairly welcome works on all themes that are beneficial to the people!

    关键在于质量
    思芳
    常常听到议论：某种题材的作品太多了，另一种太少了。例如，去年曾听说 “写工农兵”的太多了，写其他的太少了；写生产、斗争的太多了，写个人日常生活的太少了。今年又听到写“其他”的太多了，写爱情的太多了，“揭露阴暗面”的太多了……。
    这种讲法似乎不太“科学”。所谓“少”者诚少，斥其“多”者却未必多。
    从全国范围来看，创作还亟需发展，无论量与质，都远远不能满足人民的需要。总的情况是我们的作品——比较好的作品太少了，不是太多了。去年都说反映农业合作化的剧本太多，其实真正站得住的却少得可怜；最近有人说写爱情写的太多了，其实，为了出产今天的“西厢记”、“红楼梦”也尚待作家加油努力。有时候，某种题材的作品奇缺，譬如反映学校生活、科学家的生活和科学幻想小说等，呼喊一下“这种题材写得太少了！”以示提倡之意，那是完全必要的；但这种少了不等于那种多了，逆定理不一定成立。
    有时候某种题材的某一部分作品发生了一些“流行病”，如写农业合作化的剧本出现了“套子”，写爱情写成了“黄色”，揭露阴暗面的时候未能更有力地肯定和巩固我们的新社会、新生活等，这时，需要细心地分析病源：或是公式化概念化，或是低级趣味，或是小资产阶级情调……却不必加白眼于某种题材，题材无罪，罪在作者。
    作家写哪一种题材的作品，是并不完全以他的主观意图和评论者的好心劝告为转移的。任何了不起的作家，也要受自己的生活经验、才能特点……的限制，有自己的“特长”和“特短”。作品题材的比例，不可能像按计划生产的商品，时时都比较能保持一定的平衡。在题材问题上，还是多作正面文章吧，如提倡写工农兵，提倡写新人物，提倡写作家所熟悉、所感兴趣的非写不可的东西！那种轻易地发出这个多了那个多了的指责，只会使作家迷惑。在这方面，作家是很苦的。他酝酿一个题材需要半年、一年，甚至许多年，而某些评论者放的空气，却可能在短时间打乱了他的计划。作家也要谨慎，要独立思考，不要在此风彼风下摆来摆去。
    让我们更多地提倡写工农兵，写新人物吧！让我们多从作品的质量着眼吧！让我们更公正地欢迎有益于人民的写一切题材的作品吧！
