    For Mutual Assistance and Cooperation Among Socialist Camp Countries
    Ao·Xi Mu? Ke
    Chairman of the Czechoslovak State Planning Commission
    Member of the Czechoslovak Government Delegation
    The great Chinese people and the Czechoslovak people are advancing towards the same goal. Together with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, they are fighting for the great cause of mankind, that is, striving for the happiness and free life of all mankind, and for the victory of socialism. Despite the aggressive attempts of the imperialist bloc to undermine the socialist system and the communist movement, we are still closely united and moving towards the victorious prospect of our cause. Our achievements in developing the national economy irrefutably prove that the socialist system is superior to capitalism.
    The working people of Czechoslovakia are happily watching the smooth development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people are realizing socialist industrialization according to the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, while carrying out socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts, and have found a way of socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises that is suitable for the characteristics of Chinese society. These have effectively improved the production of Chinese industry and agriculture.
    In 1956, the Czechoslovak national economy also took a big step forward. For example, industrial production in 1956 increased by 9.5% compared to 1955, and by 270% compared to 1937.
    This speed of industrial development in Czechoslovakia means that Czechoslovakia, with its relatively dense population and high level of national economic development, is no less advanced than capitalist countries with a long history and a high degree of industrial development.
    The production of Czechoslovakia's most important industrial products is increasing every year. In 1956, coal production increased by 11% compared to the previous year, reaching 68 million tons, pig iron production increased to 3.3 million tons, steel production increased by 408,000 tons, reaching 4.9 million tons; cement production increased by 8.9%, and can now produce 3.1 million tons; electricity production reached more than 16 billion kilowatt-hours in 1956.
    Due to the implementation of cooperation, the state’s allocation of large amounts of funds to improve the degree of agricultural mechanization, and other measures, our agricultural production, especially animal husbandry production, has increased a lot.
    The achievements made by the People's Republic of China and Czechoslovakia, as well as the achievements made by the entire socialist camp, have given us tremendous strength and prompted us to move forward with confidence on the road to a bright future.
    Of course, this road is not without difficulties.
    However, due to the superiority of the socialist system and the economic cooperation of the countries in the socialist system, the obstacles we encounter on the road to socialism are relatively easy to overcome.
    Commodity exchange with the Soviet Union, People's China, and other socialist countries occupies a major position in Czechoslovakia's foreign trade today, and it is a powerful factor in stabilizing Czechoslovakia's national economy.
    It is precisely because of this that, recently, although the Czechoslovak national economy encountered some difficulties that were aggravated by the effects of external factors, the difficulties were overcome. The reason why we were able to overcome these difficulties was not only through methods of highly utilizing Czechoslovakia's own resources, but also largely due to the increased supply of raw materials from the Soviet Union, which showed comradely understanding of our difficulties. The significance of this assistance from the Soviet Union to our country is very great.
    The interests of further developing the national economies of various socialist countries and further strengthening the unity of socialist camp countries require maximizing mutual economic cooperation and utilizing all possibilities for bilateral cooperation between countries. We can happily say that the economic cooperation between the People's Republic of China and Czechoslovakia has greatly promoted the development of the national economies of the two countries and has helped to consolidate the unity of socialist camp countries. The economic ties between China and Czechoslovakia are expanding year by year. The total volume of commodity exchange in 1956 was five times that of 1950. At the same time, it should be noted with satisfaction that the Sino-Czech trade agreements have been developing steadily, and supply contracts concluded according to these agreements are always signed before the trade agreements are signed. The goods supplied by Czechoslovakia, primarily the supply of machinery and capital goods, have promoted the construction of major sectors of Chinese industry; at the same time, the iron ore, certain non-ferrous metals, vegetable oil, tea, food and other commodities supplied by the People's Republic of China have effectively helped us ensure the production of Czechoslovak enterprises and ensure the food supply to residents.
    The 1957 Sino-Czech trade agreement signed in Prague on the eve of the departure of the Czechoslovak government delegation to the People's Republic of China is a new proof of this outstanding connection.
    Similarly, cooperation in science and technology has a positive impact on the economic development of both sides. Czechoslovak experts have learned about China's achievements in the chemical industry, food industry and porcelain production; Czechoslovak industry has obtained technical specifications from China for the manufacture of silk, linen, paper and other manufactured goods. On the other hand, Czechoslovakia has helped China with engineering design and equipment installation in machinery manufacturing, metallurgy, chemical and construction industries, and supplied technical documents for various equipment.
    The People's Republic of China's infinite economic potential and Czechoslovakia's potential in various industrial sectors enable the two countries to continuously expand and strengthen economic cooperation.
    The economic cooperation between the People's Republic of China and Czechoslovakia is based on the principles of mutual respect, voluntariness and mutual benefit, and fully takes into account the needs of the two countries' economic development.
    Therefore, it is understandable that the economic cooperation of the countries in the socialist camp is of extremely important significance for accelerating the development and improving the effectiveness of the national economies of the countries participating in the cooperation. This cooperation is also a blow to the imperialist bloc's attempts to weaken the economic and political power of the countries in the socialist camp.
    The achievements of economic cooperation between the People's Republic of China and Czechoslovakia, and the economic potential of our two countries, not only create conditions for strengthening economic cooperation with the countries of the socialist camp, but also create conditions for developing economic cooperation with other countries, especially Asian countries.
    The people of Czechoslovakia, a Central European country far from China, watch with respect and excitement the great cause of the Chinese people, who have a cultural tradition of thousands of years. China, together with the Soviet Union, is standing at the forefront of just mankind. The Czechoslovak people cherish cooperation with the Chinese people and are deeply convinced that further strengthening this cooperation will consolidate the common cause of striving for socialism.

    为了社会主义阵营各国的互助合作
    捷克斯洛伐克国家计划委员会主席
    捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团团员	奥·西穆?克
    伟大的中国人民和捷克斯洛伐克人民正向着同一个目标前进。它们同苏联和其他人民民主国家一起为实现人类的伟大事业，即争取全人类的幸福和自由的生活，争取社会主义的胜利而斗争。尽管帝国主义集团怀有破坏社会主义制度和共产主义运动的各种侵略性的企图，但是我们仍然紧密地团结在一起，向着我们事业的胜利前景迈进。我们在发展国民经济中所获得的成就，无可辩驳地证明了社会主义制度比资本主义优越。
    捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民怀着愉快的心情注视着中华人民共和国国民经济的顺利发展，中国人民在中国共产党的英明领导下，正在根据优先发展重工业的方针实现着社会主义工业化，同时对农业和手工业进行了社会主义的改造，并找到了适合中国社会特点的私营工商业社会主义改造的方式。这些，都十分有成效地提高了中国工业和农业的生产。
    1956年，捷克斯洛伐克国民经济也向前迈进了一大步。例如，1956年的工业生产比1955年增加了9.5％，比1937年增加了270％。
    捷克斯洛伐克工业发展的这种速度意味着：人口相当稠密的捷克斯洛伐克，以其国民经济的高度发展水平来说，是并不逊于具有悠久历史的、工业高度发展的资本主义国家的。
    捷克斯洛伐克最重要的工业产品的生产每年都在增加。1956年，煤产量比上一年增加了11％，达到了六千八百万吨，生铁产量增加到三百三十万吨，钢的产量增加了四十万零八千吨，达到了四百九十万吨；水泥的产量增加了8.9％，现在可以生产三百一十万吨；电力生产在1956年达到了一百六十多亿瓩时。
    由于实行了合作化和国家拨付大量资金来提高农业机械化的程度，以及其他的措施，我国的农业生产特别是畜牧业生产增加了很多。
    中华人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克所获得的成就，以及整个社会主义阵营所获得的成就，都给与了我们巨大的力量，并促使我们满怀信心地向美好的未来的道路前进。
    当然，这条道路并不是没有困难的。
    但是，由于社会主义制度的优越性和社会主义体系各国的经济合作，使得我们在向社会主义前进道路上遇到的阻碍比较容易克服。
    同苏联、人民中国和其他社会主义国家的商品交换，今天在捷克斯洛伐克的对外贸易中占着主要地位，它是稳定捷克斯洛伐克国民经济的有力因素。
    正是由于这样，最近期间，虽然捷克斯洛伐克国民经济遇到了因外来因素的作用而加重的一些困难，但困难是被克服了。我们之所以能够克服这些困难，不仅是通过高度利用捷克斯洛伐克本身资源的方法，而在很大程度上也是由于来自同志般体谅我们的困难的苏联的原料供应增加了，苏联对我国的这种援助的意义是十分巨大的。
    进一步发展各个社会主义国家的国民经济和进一步加强社会主义阵营国家团结的利益，要求尽量加强相互间的经济合作，并利用国与国之间双边合作的一切可能。我们可以满怀高兴地说，中华人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克的经济合作，在很大程度上促进了两国国民经济的发展，并有助于社会主义阵营国家团结的巩固。中捷两国相互间的经济联系在逐年扩大。1956年的商品交换总量为1950年的五倍。同时应当满意地指出，中捷贸易协定一直是稳定发展的，根据这些协定而缔结的供应合同总是在贸易协定签字前就签订了。捷克斯洛伐克供应的商品，首先是机器和资本财的供应，促进了中国工业主要部门的建设；同时，中华人民共和国供给的铁矿石、某些有色金属、植物油、茶叶、食品及其他商品，则有效地帮助我们保证了捷克斯洛伐克企业的生产，保证了对居民的食品供应。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团启程前往中华人民共和国前夕在布拉格签订的1957年中捷贸易协定，是这种卓越联系的新的证明。
    同样，在科学技术方面的合作对于双方的经济发展也有着积极的影响。捷克斯洛伐克的专家们了解了中国的化学工业、食品工业和瓷器生产的成就；捷克斯洛伐克的工业得到了中国出产的关于制造丝、麻、纸和其它制造品的技术说明书。另一方面，捷克斯洛伐克在机器制造、冶金、化学和建筑工业的工程设计和设备安装给中国以帮助，并供给各种装备的技术文件。
    中华人民共和国无穷的经济潜力和捷克斯洛伐克多种工业部门的潜力，使两国能够不断扩大和加强经济方面的合作。
    中华人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克的经济合作是建立在相互尊重自愿和互利的原则之上的，并且充分考虑到两国的经济发展的需要。
    因此，可以理解，社会主义阵营各国的经济合作，对于加速发展和提高参加合作的各国的国民经济效能有着极其重要的意义。这种合作对于帝国主义集团想削弱社会主义阵营各国的经济和政治力量的图谋也是一个打击。
    中华人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克之间经济合作的成果，和我们两国的经济潜能，不仅为加强同社会主义阵营各国的经济合作，而且也为发展同其它国家特别是亚洲国家的经济合作创造了条件。
    远离中国的中欧国家捷克斯洛伐克的人民，以尊敬的和兴奋的心情注视着具有几千年文化传统的中国人民的伟大事业。中国同苏联一起正站在正义人类的最前列。捷克斯洛伐克人民珍视同中国人民的合作，并且深信，进一步加强这个合作，将会巩固争取社会主义的共同事业。
