    The talks held in Moscow between the Soviet government and Communist Party delegation and the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government and Socialist Workers' Party delegation have concluded successfully. In the joint government declaration and the party talks statement issued on the 28th, both sides reached a consensus on the causes and counter-revolutionary nature of the Hungarian events of last October and November, on expanding and developing friendly cooperation between the two governments and parties, on assisting the Hungarian people to overcome temporary difficulties and smoothly build socialism, and on some important issues in the current international situation and the international workers' movement. This meeting is another major event in the relations between socialist countries. Through this meeting, not only has the friendly alliance between the Soviet Union and Hungary been further consolidated and developed, but it also has significant meaning for strengthening the great unity of socialist countries and safeguarding the cause of world peace. The Chinese people are very satisfied with the achievements of this meeting.
    In the meeting, the Soviet and Hungarian governments and parties made a Marxist-Leninist analysis of the causes of the Hungarian events and once again affirmed the counter-revolutionary nature of the Hungarian events. This is entirely correct. The extensively revealed materials prove that the imperialist aggressive bloc headed by the United States and the Hungarian counter-revolutionary forces under their command took advantage of the Hungarian people's demand to quickly correct the mistakes made by the former Hungarian leaders and launched a despicable armed rebellion. Their purpose was to destroy the socialist system in Hungary, restore the capitalist system and fascist terror rule in Hungary, and turn Hungary into a new source of war threatening European and world peace. The two governments' declaration and the parties' talks statement severely condemned the Nagy-Losonczy traitorous clique's internal betrayal policy for its serious responsibility for the counter-revolutionary rebellion. The Nagy traitorous clique had long spread revisionist views, incited nationalist sentiments, and engaged in factional activities within the Hungarian Working People's Party, undermining the foundation of the party from within. This group had been coordinating with underground counter-revolutionaries under the guise of supporting socialism even before the October events. After usurping the leadership of the government, they further openly colluded with counter-revolutionaries to eliminate the party and destroy socialist achievements from the outside. When Nagy reorganized the government for the third time on November 3, he completely excluded members of the Hungarian Working People's Party and progressives who served as ministers and deputy chairmen of the Council of Ministers in the original government, and brought into the government the heads of reactionary parties who had consistently opposed Hungary's socialist cause and had been restored and established after the events. He also released treasonous criminals, condoned and shielded the white terror crimes of the counter-revolution, wantonly incited nationalist sentiments, and shamelessly declared neutrality to the United Nations. In the end, he became madly called for resistance to the Soviet army, which was invited to stop the white terror crimes. The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party delegation correctly pointed out in the joint statement that "if there are factions in the ruling Marxist-Leninist party of the working class, the opposition factions engaged in anti-party activities will unite with the counter-revolution and become its tool." The Soviet Communist Party delegation fully agreed with this view of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party delegation. We believe that this is one of the important lessons that all communist and workers' parties should learn from the Hungarian events.
    One of the schemes of the imperialist group in instigating the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion was to open a gap in Hungary, undermine the unity of the socialist camp, and then defeat all socialist countries one by one. However, the unity of socialist countries based on proletarian internationalism and Lenin's principle of national equality cannot be undermined by any dark forces. The Hungarian people's victory over the counter-revolution and the continuous consolidation and development of the friendship and unity between the Soviet Union and Hungary most powerfully prove this truth. In this meeting, the Soviet and Hungarian sides comprehensively reviewed the relations between the two countries in the past in political, economic, and military aspects, and decided to take many important measures to further strengthen the friendly alliance between the two countries. The friendship between the Soviet and Hungarian people has undergone severe tests. The Soviet people twice sacrificed blood to give fraternal assistance to the Hungarian people. During the Second World War, the heroic Soviet army liberated Hungary from fascist occupation, opened up the road to socialism for the Hungarian people, and the Soviet Union also provided great assistance to Hungary's socialist construction. In the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion last year, the great Soviet army, at the request of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, once again rescued the Hungarian people from the brink of fascism and war, and saved the socialist cause in Hungary. In this negotiation, the Soviet Union decided to provide comprehensive economic assistance to Hungary, supplying Hungary with goods worth a total of 1,001 million rubles this year and granting Hungary a long-term loan of 750 million rubles. At the same time, the two sides also reached agreements on other economic cooperation and cultural exchanges. The Soviet Union's enormous and selfless assistance to Hungary will greatly help consolidate the socialist system in Hungary and develop Hungary's socialist construction. These facts powerfully demonstrate the importance of the unity of socialist countries, and demonstrate the importance of friendship and alliance with the great Soviet Union to the common cause of socialist construction and the defense of world peace in other socialist countries.
    In the Soviet-Hungarian talks, opinions were also exchanged on the current international situation, condemning the imperialist group headed by the United States for continuing to implement the "position of strength" policy, intensifying international tensions, and carrying out heinous conspiracies to subvert and sabotage the socialist camp countries. Both sides pointed out that in the current international situation, with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization stepping up its activities, West Germany joining the North Atlantic aggressive group, and West German armed forces being equipped with atomic weapons, and the United States formally adopting the "Eisenhower Doctrine" aimed at aggression and enslavement of the Middle East, further strengthening the friendship between the two countries and the unity of the socialist camp is one of the important tasks at present. The Warsaw Treaty bears the important mission of defending socialist countries and preventing European imperialist aggression, so it must be further supported and consolidated. The two governments' consistent views on the Warsaw Treaty and the agreements reached are of great significance to the security of socialist countries and European peace.
    The Chinese people sincerely congratulate the major achievements of the Soviet-Hungarian talks and are willing to work together with all socialist countries to consolidate the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    亲如兄弟的友谊
    苏联政府和共产党代表团同匈牙利工农革命政府和社会主义工人党代表团在莫斯科举行的会谈，已经园满结束了。在28日发表的两国政府宣言和两党会谈声明中，双方对去年10月和11月间匈牙利事件的起因和它的反革命性质，对扩大和发展两国政府和党之间的友好合作关系，对援助匈牙利人民克服暂时困难以顺利建设社会主义以及对当前国际局势和国际工人运动中的一些重要问题，都取得了一致的看法。这次会谈是社会主义国家关系中的又一重大事件，通过这一会谈不仅使苏匈两国的友好同盟关系，得到了进一步的巩固和发展，而且对加强社会主义国家的伟大团结和维护世界和平的事业具有重大的意义。中国人民对于这次会谈的成就感到十分满意。
    苏匈两国政府和党在会谈中对匈牙利事件的原因作了马克思列宁主义的分析，并且再一次肯定了匈牙利事件的反革命性质。这是完全正确的。已经大量揭露出来的材料证明，以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团和它们指使下的匈牙利反革命势力，曾经利用匈牙利人民要求迅速纠正匈牙利前领导所犯的错误的机会，发动了可耻的武装暴乱。其目的是想摧毁匈牙利的社会主义制度，在匈牙利恢复资本主义制度和法西斯恐怖统治，并把匈牙利变成威胁欧洲和世界和平的新战争策源地。在两国政府宣言和两党会谈声明中，严厉地谴责了纳吉—洛松齐叛逆集团的内部叛卖政策对反革命叛乱所负的严重责任。纳吉叛逆集团在匈牙利劳动人民党中长期传播修正主义观点，煽动民族主义情绪，从事派别活动，从内部动摇党的基础。这个集团在十月事件以前就在拥护社会主义的伪装下和地下的反革命分子配合行动了。他们在篡夺了政府的领导权以后，进而公开地同反革命分子勾结一起，从外部来消灭党，毁灭社会主义成果。纳吉在11月3日第三次改组政府时，完全排除了原政府中担任各部部长和部长会议副主席的匈牙利劳动人民党党员和进步人士，而把那些一贯反对匈牙利社会主义事业、在事件发生后恢复和成立的反动党派的头目拉进政府，并释放叛国罪犯，纵容和包庇反革命的白色恐怖罪行，大肆煽动民族主义情绪，无耻地向联合国声明中立。而最后竟丧心病狂地号召抵抗被请来制止白色恐怖罪行的苏联军队。匈牙利社会主义工人党代表团在两党联合声明中正确地指出，“如果在执政的工人阶级的马克思列宁主义政党中有派别存在，进行反党活动的反对派别就会同反革命联合起来，并且变成它的工具。”苏联共产党代表团完全同意匈牙利社会主义工人党代表团的这种看法。我们认为这是各国共产党和工人党都应该从匈牙利事件中所吸取的重要教训之一。
    帝国主义集团策动匈牙利反革命暴乱的阴谋之一就是想在匈牙利打开一个缺口，破坏社会主义阵营的团结，然后再各个击破所有社会主义国家。但是，以无产阶级国际主义和列宁的民族平等原则为基础的社会主义国家的团结，是任何黑暗势力都不能破坏的。匈牙利人民对反革命的胜利和苏匈两国的友谊和团结的不断巩固和发展这一事实，最有力地证明了这一真理。在这次会谈中，苏匈双方全面审查了两国过去在政治、经济和军事等方面的关系，并决定采取许多重要措施来进一步加强两国的友好同盟关系。苏匈两国人民的友谊已经经历了严重的考验。苏联人民曾两次不惜流血牺牲给匈牙利人民以兄弟的援助。在第二次世界大战年代里，英勇的苏联军队把匈牙利从法西斯占领下解放出来，为匈牙利人民开辟了走向社会主义的道路，对匈牙利的社会主义建设苏联也给予了巨大的援助。在去年匈牙利反革命暴乱中，伟大的苏联军队应匈牙利工农革命政府的请求，再一次把匈牙利人民从法西斯和战争的边缘中拯救出来，挽救了匈牙利的社会主义事业。在这次谈判中，苏联决定向匈牙利提供全面的经济援助，今年将供应匈牙利总值十亿零一千万卢布的商品，贷给匈牙利七亿五千万卢布的长期贷款。同时双方还就其他经济合作和文化交流等取得了协议。苏联对匈牙利这种巨大的慷慨无私的援助，将大大有助于巩固匈牙利的社会主义制度和发展匈牙利的社会主义建设事业。这些事实有力地证明了社会主义各国团结一致的重要性，证明了同伟大的苏联的友谊和同盟对其他社会主义国家建设社会主义和保卫世界和平的共同事业的重要性。
    苏匈会谈中，还就目前国际局势交换了意见，谴责以美国为首的帝国主义集团继续执行“实力地位”政策，加剧国际紧张局势，并对社会主义阵营各国进行颠复破坏活动的罪恶阴谋。双方指出，在目前国际形势之下，在北大西洋公约组织加紧活动、西德加入北大西洋侵略集团和西德武装部队配备原子武器以及美国正式通过旨在侵略和奴役中东的“艾森豪威尔主义”的情况下，进一步加强两国友谊和社会主义阵营团结是当前的重要任务之一。而华沙条约则负有保卫社会主义国家，防备欧洲帝国主义侵略的重要使命，因此必须进一步加以支持和巩固。两国政府对华沙条约的一致看法和所达成的协议，对社会主义各国的安全和欧洲和平，都有重要的意义。
    中国人民衷心地祝贺苏匈会谈的重大成就，并愿同所有社会主义国家一道，为巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结而努力。
