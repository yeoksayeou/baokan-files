Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd — After the Communist Party Branch Committee and the Commune Management Committee of the First Agricultural Cooperative of Puqiao Township, Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, implemented a clear division of labor, a new atmosphere emerged in the branch's work.

    In the past, the secretary of the Communist Party branch of the First Agricultural Cooperative concurrently served as the director of the agricultural cooperative. Because the agricultural cooperative had many affairs, there was no time or energy to study Party work. As a result, the branch committee became no one's responsibility, and even failed to hold branch committee meetings for years. The management committee frequently replaced the branch committee, and meetings of cadres above the level of small team leader replaced Party member meetings. Party members did not receive help and education and felt dissatisfied. During the branch's re-election in mid-January, Party members raised many opinions about the branch's work. The new branch committee decided that the Party branch secretary would no longer concurrently serve as the commune director in order to have ample time to consider Party work. Each branch committee member was also assigned specific responsibilities.

    After the work of the Party and the commune were separated, the branch's ideological education of Party members was significantly strengthened, and the organizational life within the Party was more active than in the past. After Zhang Guirong, the deputy branch secretary, took charge of Party member education, she established a bi-monthly Party class system, no longer relying solely on the general branch to give Party classes as before. In the recent four meetings held by the branch committee, two were devoted to studying the learning of Party members and the 1957 production plan for the entire commune. In addition to giving Party classes to Party members, Xing Qixiong, the Party branch secretary, also promoted the superiority of collectivization to the masses. Wang Xicheng, the organization committee member, was also able to proactively help Party members with shortcomings. For example, Yang Shirong, a probationary Party member, was once engaged in selling pork in Shanghai because he was not content with agricultural production. After Wang Xicheng discovered this problem, he helped Yang Shirong, making him realize his mistake. Gao Yuliang, a probationary Party member, was the commune's full-time accountant. Previously, the commune asked him to participate in some production without clearly explaining the reason, and he was ideologically resistant. Now, his problem has been discussed at the Party member meeting, making him understand that reducing full-time cadres is to reduce the burden on commune members and strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses, and he happily participated in production.

    Due to the strengthening of various tasks of the branch, the enthusiasm of Party members has been greatly improved. At present, the commune's spring plowing preparation work is progressing very well. All 1,750 mu of wheat fields in the commune have been fertilized twice. The commune's small-scale water conservancy projects are also about to begin.

### 蒲桥乡第一农业社党社分工明确以后  支部思想工作加强，组织生活活跃

    蒲桥乡第一农业社党社分工明确以后
    支部思想工作加强，组织生活活跃
    新华社南京2日电  江苏省江阴县蒲桥乡第一农业社中共支部委员会和社务管理委员会实行明确分工，使支部工作出现了新的气象。
    第一农业社的中共支部书记过去兼任农业社主任。因为农业社的事情很多，对党的工作就没有时间和精力来进行研究，结果支委会形成无人负责，甚至成年不开支部委员会会议，经常以管理委员会来代替支委会，以小队长以上的干部会议来代替党员大会。党员得不到帮助和教育，感到不满。1月中旬支部进行改选时，党员对支部工作提了很多意见。这次新的支部委员会就决定党支部书记不再兼任社主任，以便有充分时间来考虑党的工作。各个支部委员也都作了分工。
    党和社的工作分开以后，支部对党员的思想教育工作有了明显的加强，党内的组织生活也比过去活跃了。副支部书记张桂荣负责党员的教育工作后，建立了每月两次的党课制度，不再像以前那样单纯地依赖总支来上党课。支部委员会在最近举行的四次会议，就有两次是研究党员的学习和1957年全社生产规划问题。党支部书记邢奇雄除给党员上党课以外，还向群众宣传合作化的优越性。组织委员王希成也能主动地对有缺点的党员进行帮助，例如预备党员杨世荣因为不安心农业生产，曾贩猪肉到上海去卖，王希成发现这一问题后就对杨世荣进行帮助，使他认识了自己的错误。预备党员高玉良是社的脱产会计，以前社里没有和他说清理由就叫他去参加一部分生产，他的思想不通。现在在党员大会上对他的问题进行了讨论，使他知道减少脱产干部是为了减少社员的负担和加强党与群众的联系，他就愉快地参加了生产。
    由于支部的各项工作有了加强，党员的积极性就大大提高了。目前，社里的春耕准备工作做得很好。全社一千七百五十亩麦田都已施了两次肥。社里的小型水利工程也即将开始。
