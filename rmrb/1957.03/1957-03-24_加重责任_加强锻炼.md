    Increase Responsibility, Strengthen Training
    Liu Jingji suggests: In order to enable private sector personnel to better accept transformation and contribute more to the country, it may be appropriate to increase their responsibilities and provide them with further training and development in practical work.
    I fully endorse the reports of Chairman Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and Vice Premiers Chen Yun and Li Fuchun. I would now like to express some personal opinions on how our industrialists and businessmen can increase their responsibilities and strengthen their training in the process of further transformation.
    It has been more than a year since the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC. This year has been one of the most transformative in China's history. Due to the decisive victory of socialist transformation, fundamental changes have taken place in the relations of production, and production has greatly developed. The social status of our industrialists and businessmen has also undergone great changes. Enterprises are gradually transitioning to nationalization, and individuals are transitioning to self-reliant laborers. With the general direction clarified, the positive aspects of our industrial and commercial circles have been further expanded, and everything is developing vigorously towards a bright future. However, some new ideas and problems have also arisen in the process of moving forward. For example, some people in our industrial and commercial circles have turned the positive significance of the redemption policy, which encourages us to "study with peace of mind, work with peace of mind, and transform with peace of mind," into a passive attitude of "being content with the status quo and relaxing transformation." In terms of enterprise work, there are reflections such as: "very responsible" before liberation, "had to be responsible" during the private sector period after liberation, and "can be irresponsible" after the joint state-private ownership of enterprises. Some people completely rely on the state representatives for the success of the enterprise, thinking that this is obeying leadership; they completely push the responsibility for production onto the workers, thinking that this is relying on the working class. In the past, during the private sector period, if raw materials were not supplied, finished products could not be sold, and wages could not be paid, they would be extremely anxious. Now, it seems that everything is the responsibility of the state, and they are as stable as Mount Tai. If there are any errors or losses in the production and operation of the enterprise, and they are to be criticized and punished, there are also state representatives to bear the brunt, and they seem to have nothing to do with it. They do not have the same sense of connection with the enterprise as they did during the private sector period, and some upper-level members have even developed some complacency. Although these guest-like thoughts and relaxed attitudes belong to a minority of people, if they are not criticized and overcome in time, it will not only be detrimental to national construction, but also detrimental to their own transformation. Of course, there are also some objective reasons for the emergence of these situations. Some work arrangements are not appropriate, some still have some difficulties in life, and some feel restricted due to insufficient support, assistance, and trust from state representatives. Some feel that the old methods of private sector personnel are no longer applicable, and they have not yet learned the new skills, and they have not yet kept up with the objective requirements of how to do the new work well. But in general, it is still that our industrialists and businessmen are not proactive and enthusiastic enough, and their sense of responsibility is not strong. Our own thoughts and actions have not been raised to the same level as the changes in our social status. The reflection of these situations precisely illustrates the arduousness of the transformation of our industrialists and businessmen. Therefore, we should not only not "be content with the status quo and relax transformation," but rather "strengthen study and accelerate transformation" by facing production and taking the enterprise as the base.
    In order to enable our private sector personnel to better accept transformation and contribute more to the country, in addition to stepping up the study of theoretical policies, strengthening the education of private sector personnel in fulfilling their duties and responsibilities, and earnestly improving and establishing necessary work systems and reward and punishment methods, I believe that we should also increase the responsibilities and strengthen the training of our private sector personnel. Therefore, I have an immature suggestion: In factories with Party organizations and established democratic management committees, and for private sector personnel who meet certain conditions, help them to truly take on more responsibilities and receive further training and development in practical work. Enable them to deeply learn new administrative leadership and management methods on the basis of increased responsibilities. Even if the state needs to transfer some of the cadre forces already invested in joint state-private enterprises to more important work positions, and no new state representatives are sent down, the state can support these private sector personnel who are being trained and who already meet certain conditions to take on the major and glorious responsibilities entrusted to them by the state under the leadership of the enterprise Party committee and higher-level organs, and with the support and supervision of the trade union. From the practical training of learning by doing, cultivate them to gradually become national enterprise cadres who are truly responsible to the country. In particular, attention should be paid to promoting qualified employees to fill the administrative leadership of the enterprise. In this way, our private sector personnel can get rid of reliance and establish an independent thinking, proactive and enthusiastic spirit, and better care for and love socialist enterprises with the "very responsible" attitude of the past towards private enterprises, and serve the construction of the motherland.
    I initially felt that this proposal was a bit early, but after thinking carefully, after the fixed interest, the relations of production have undergone fundamental changes, and enterprises are transitioning to nationalization and individuals are transitioning to self-reliant laborers, and the direction has long been clear. During this transition period, it is beneficial to do some proactive preparatory work earlier. Moreover, I am suggesting that enterprises and private sector personnel with certain conditions be taken as the object for training first, rather than spreading it out across the board. These private sector personnel who already meet certain conditions, under the leadership of the enterprise Party committee and higher-level organs, and with the support and supervision of the trade union, can take on greater responsibilities entrusted to them by the state, which is more embodied in the state's leadership, increased responsibilities, strengthened training, and accelerated transformation. As for factories that have not yet been assigned state representatives, because the situations are different, of course, they must be studied separately according to specific conditions. These opinions of mine are immature, and I welcome criticism and corrections. (Attached picture)

    加重责任　加强锻炼
    刘靖基建议：为了使私方人员更好地接受改造，更多地为国家贡献力量，可以斟酌情况，使他们多担负责任，并在实际工作中得到进一步的锻炼和培养。
    我完全拥护周恩来主席、陈叔通副主席和陈云、李富春两位副总理的报告，我现在就我们工商业者，在进一步改造中，如何加重责任，加强锻炼的问题，发表一些我个人的意见。
    二届政协全国委员会第二次全体会议，到现在已经一年多了，这一年是我国历史上变化最大的一年。由于社会主义改造取得了决定性胜利，生产关系起了根本性变化，生产有了很大的发展。我们工商业者在社会上的地位，也起了很大的变化，企业正在逐步向国有化过渡，个人也正在向自食其力的劳动者过渡。总的方向明确了，我们工商界积极的一面也更加扩大，一切都向着光明前途蓬勃地发展。但是在前进过程中，也带来了一些新的思想和问题，例如，我们工商界中间，有些人把赎买政策鼓励我们“安心学习、安心工作、安心改造”的积极意义，变成了“安于现状、放松改造”的消极对待。在企业工作方面，有这些反映，解放前“很负责”，解放后私营时期“不得不负责”，在企业合营后，“可以不负责”。有些人把企业搞得好不好，完全依赖在公方身上，认为这就是服从领导；把生产搞得好不好，完全推在工人头上，认为这就是依靠工人阶级；过去私营时期，原材料供应不上，成品销不出去，工资发不出来，是急得要命，现在好像一切都有国家负责，安如泰山。如果企业生产经营有了什么错误和损失，要受到批评和处分，也是有公股代表顶在前面，自己好像没有什么关系。对企业不像在私营时期有血肉之感，部分上层分子，更滋长了一些骄傲自满情绪。这些作客思想和松劲现象，虽然属于少数人，但是如果不及时加以批判和克服，不但不利于国家建设，也不利于自己的改造。当然，这些情况的产生，也有一些客观原因，有的工作安排得不甚恰当，有的生活上还有一些困难，有的由于公方代表的支持帮助和信任还有不足，感到缩手缩脚。有的由于私方人员在私营时期老一套的东西已不适用，新的一套本事还没有学会，到底如何做好新的工作，还没有跟得上客观的要求。但是总的来说，还是我们工商业者自己的主动积极性不够，责任感不强，我们自己的思想和行动，还没有随着社会地位的变化而同样提高。这些情况的反映，正是说明了我们工商业者改造的艰巨性。因此，我们现在不但不应该“安于现状，放松改造”，而是更要面对生产，以企业为基地来“加强学习，加紧改造”。
    为了使我们私方人员更好地接受改造，更多地为国家贡献力量，除了加紧理论政策学习，加强私方人员守职尽责教育，认真健全和建立必要的工作制度和奖励处分办法以外。我认为还要对我们私方人员加重责任，加强锻炼。因此，我有个不成熟的建议：在有党委组织的，已建立民主管理委员会的工厂，和具备一定条件的私方人员，帮助他们切实多负起责任来，在实际工作中，得到进一步的锻炼和培养。使他们在加重责任的基础上，来深入地学习新的行政领导和经营管理方法，即使国家因为要抽调出一部分已投入合营工厂的干部力量到更重要的工作岗位上去，而没有新的公股代表派下来的时候，国家就可以把这些正在培养的已有一定条件的私方人员，支持他们在企业党委和上级机关领导下，工会支持和监督下，担当起国家交与他们重大的光荣责任。从边做边学的实际锻炼中，培养他们逐步成为一个名符其实对国家负责的国营企业干部，尤其是要注意提拔有条件的职工充实企业行政领导。这样，可以使我们私方人员，摆脱依赖思想，建立起独立思考，主动积极的精神，把过去对私营企业“很负责”的态度，更好地来关心和热爱社会主义性质的企业，为祖国建设服务。
    这样的提法，我最初觉得早了一些，但是仔细想一想，在定息以后，生产关系已有了根本性变化，企业正在向国有化过渡、个人正在向自食其力的劳动者过渡，方向早已明确。在这个过渡时间，早做一些积极性的准备工作，是有好处的。况且我是建议对具有一定条件的企业和私方人员，作为对象先进行培养。而不是全面铺开。这些已有一定条件的私方人员，在企业党委和上级机关领导下，在工会支持和监督下，能够担当起国家交与的更大责任，就更体现在公方领导下，加重了责任，加强了锻炼，加紧了改造。至于一般还没有派公股代表的工厂，由于情况各有不同，当然要根据具体条件，另行研究。我这些意见是不成熟的，不妥当地方，请各位批评指正。（附图片）
