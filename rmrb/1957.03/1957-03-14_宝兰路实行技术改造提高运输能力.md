    Baolan Railway Implements Technical Upgrades to Improve Transport Capacity

    (Our report) Since the technical改造 (gǎizào, transformation/upgrade) of the Baoji-Lanzhou railway and the Lanzhou-Wuwei railway began a year ago, the throughput capacity has started to increase, which has played a significant role in meeting the transportation needs of the Northwest region.

    The Baoji-Tianshui section of the Baolan Railway had poor line quality and simple equipment, resulting in low train speeds and throughput capacity. Landslides and road closures were also common during the rainy season. To change this situation and gradually meet transportation needs, nine stations between Baoji and Tianshui, including Guchuan, Pingtou, Yan Jiahe, Donggou, Shishulin, Shijiatan, Fengge Ridge, Weitan, and Boyang, extended their in-station tracks. The effective length of the tracks reached 530 meters, enabling large trains to operate simultaneously in both directions. Four new meeting stations were added at Maojiazhuang, Majiamo, Xiejia Slope, and Wangjiawan, increasing the throughput capacity of the railway between Tianshui and Lanzhou by 12%. In addition, after the extension of tracks at seven stations between Baoji and Tianshui, the receiving and dispatching capacity will also be improved.

    The Lanzhou-Wuwei railway has added some tracks or freight lines at Lanzhou West Station, Xigucheng, Hekou North, and Zhongbao stations to meet the needs of busy transportation.

    In the past year, more than 120 kilometers of heavy-duty rails have been replaced between Tianshui and Lanzhou. All freight locomotives in the Longxi and Lanzhou locomotive depots have been replaced with MK1 (冖ㄎ1) large locomotives, increasing the locomotive traction tonnage between Longxi and Lanzhou by 20% compared to the previous use of MK6 (冖ㄎ6) locomotives. A temporary locomotive turnaround section has been added to the Tumendun Station in the Lanzhou hub, reducing the single-engine round trips between Lanzhou and Tumendun, and alleviating the tension in the throughput capacity of this section. Currently, the technical改造 (gǎizào, transformation/upgrade) project of the Baolan Railway is still underway.

    宝兰路实行技术改造提高运输能力
    本报讯  宝鸡到兰州的铁路和兰州到武威的铁路，进行技术改造一年以来，通过能力开始提高，对满足西北地区的运输需要，起了很大的作用。
    宝兰铁路宝鸡天水段，线路质量低劣，设备简陋，行车速度和通过能力不高，雨季还常塌方断道。为了改变这种情况，逐步满足运输的需要，宝鸡天水间的固川、坪头、颜家河、东沟、柿树林、石家滩、凤阁岭、渭滩和伯阳等九个站延长了站内股道，股道有效长度达到五百三十公尺，使上下行能够同时开行大列列车。新增设了毛家庄、马家磨、谢家坡和王家湾等四个会让站，使天水和兰州间铁路的通过能力提高了12％。此外，宝鸡和天水之间七个站股道延长以后，接运能力也可提高。
    兰州到武威铁路，已经在兰州西站、西固城、河口北和中堡等站增设了一些股道或货物线以适应繁忙运输的需要。
    在过去一年里，天水兰州间共换铺了重型钢轨一百二十多公里。陇西、兰州两机务段货运机车全部换用了冖ㄎ1大型机车，使陇西、兰州间的机车牵引定数比过去使用冖ㄎ6型机车提高了20％。在兰州枢纽的土门墩站增设一个临时机务折返段，减少了兰州、土门墩间的单机往返，缓和了这个区间通过能力的紧张状态。现在，宝兰路的技术改造工程还在继续进行。
