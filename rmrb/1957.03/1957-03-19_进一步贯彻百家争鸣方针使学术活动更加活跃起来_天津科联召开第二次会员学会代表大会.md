Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 17th. Further implementing the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy to make Tianjin's academic activities more actively carried out - this is the central task proposed at the Second Member Society Representative Conference convened today by the Tianjin Branch of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies (referred to as Tianjin Science and Technology Association).

The Tianjin Science and Technology Association, which has twenty-one specialized societies and more than three thousand members, has been particularly active in its work last year in the four years since its establishment. It has held more than 1,600 academic report meetings and symposiums on scientific and technological issues, and answered 214 scientific and technological questions raised by various departments. Through these activities, it has solved many existing problems in production, teaching, and medical treatment, and improved the scientific and technological level of its members.

For example, the Acid-Base-Salt Research Group of the Chemical Industry Society assisted the Lizhong Acid Factory in improving its equipment, reducing the factory's nitric acid consumption by two-thirds. The Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory adopted the technical summary on manufacturing broaches from the Tool Research Group of the Mechanical Engineering Society, improved the heat treatment method, and extended the life of the broaches tenfold. The Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Geography Societies cooperated with the Tianjin Normal College's amateur continuing education department to run advanced physics, chemistry, geometry, and algebra training courses. One hundred and fifty junior middle school teachers participated in the study, improving their professional level, and many of them have now assumed teaching positions in high schools. In the past two years, the Pharmaceutical Society, with the joint efforts of the traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine communities, has mastered the exact efficacy of more than 100 kinds of traditional Chinese medicines through extensive investigation and pharmaceutical chemical experiments.

The meeting proposed that in future work, the Science and Technology Association and various societies must further rely on the leadership of the Party, conscientiously implement the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy in academic activities, and carry out free discussions. Members of various societies should attach importance to the study of Marxism-Leninism and current affairs policies and carry out self-reform.

The meeting adopted the new constitution and elected Yang Shixian and other forty-nine people as members of the second committee of the Science and Technology Association.

    进一步贯彻百家争鸣方针使学术活动更加活跃起来
    天津科联召开第二次会员学会代表大会
    新华社天津17日讯　进一步贯彻百家争鸣的方针，使天津市的学术活动更活跃的开展起来，这是中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会天津分会（简称天津科联）今天召开的第二次会员学会代表大会上提出的中心任务。
    拥有二十一个专门学会三千多名会员的天津科联在成立以来的四年中，去年的工作特别活跃，先后举行学术报告会和科学技术问题座谈讨论会一千六百多次，解答各个部门提出的科学技术问题二百一十四件，通过这些活动解决了不少生产、教学和医疗等方面存在的问题，提高了会员的科学技术水平。
    例如化工学会酸碱盐研究组曾经协助利中酸厂改进了设备，使工厂的硝酸消耗量减少了三分之二。天津纺织机械厂采用了机械工程学会工具研究组关于制造绞刀的技术总结，改进了热处理方法，绞刀寿命延长十倍。数学物理化学和地理学会配合天津师范学院业余进修部举办了高级物理、化学、几何和代数进修班，有一百五十名初中教师参加了学习，提高了他们的业务水平，其中很多人已担任了高中的教学工作。药学学会在最近两年来在中西医药界的共同努力下，经过广泛调查和药化试验，掌握了一百多种中药的确实效能。
    会议提出科联和各个学会在今后的工作中必须进一步依靠党的领导，在学术活动中认真贯彻百家争鸣的方针，开展自由讨论。各个学会的会员应当重视马列主义和时事政策学习，进行自我改造。
    会议通过了新的会章并选举了杨石先等四十九人为科联第二届委员会的委员。
