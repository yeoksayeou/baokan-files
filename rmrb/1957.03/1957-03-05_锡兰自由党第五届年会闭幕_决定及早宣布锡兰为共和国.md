The meeting was opened on March 2nd under the chairmanship of the Freedom Party's chairman, Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike.

Bandaranaike delivered a speech at the conference on the 2nd.

He called on his party to mobilize all progressive forces in Ceylon to fight against reactionary forces.

He listed the achievements of his government in domestic and foreign affairs. In foreign relations, he said, "We have established friendly relations with many new countries and strengthened friendly ties with other countries. We have gradually enhanced our country's prestige."

Fifteen hundred representatives attended the conference. The meeting passed many resolutions on promoting social and economic reform plans. These reform plans include recovering all foreign-owned plantations; nationalizing road transport and insurance enterprises; accelerating agricultural and industrial construction; protecting national industries from foreign competition; expanding employment opportunities; and improving health, housing, and social welfare.

The meeting also passed a resolution advocating taking steps as early as possible to declare Ceylon a republic (Ceylon is currently a British Commonwealth dominion); reaffirming the People's United Front's proposal during the general election to take steps to clarify the "reasonable use" of Tamil; and advocating the organization of cooperative farms.
