Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 18th: President Sukarno returned to Jakarta from Sumatra at noon today.

A crowd of demonstrators welcomed Sukarno at the airport, requesting him to speak. Sukarno told them that he regretted the failure to form a cooperation cabinet. He said that this was because several parties disagreed with the formation of such a cabinet, so he designated Suwirjo to organize a cabinet that could take resolute and correct measures.

Sukarno will meet with Suwirjo, the cabinet formateur, this afternoon to hear his report on forming the new cabinet.

According to Antara News Agency: Suwirjo continued to hold talks with the Nahdatul Ulama (NU) this morning on the issue of forming a cabinet. Suwirjo said that as far as the Nationalist Party is concerned, the new cabinet's political program, organization, and personnel plan are ready, and now it depends on the opinions of other parties.

One of the NU representatives participating in this morning's talks, the party's vice-chairman Dahlan, said after the meeting that, in general, his party could accept the draft cabinet program proposed by the cabinet formateur. However, they put forward several revisions, that is, they requested that the task of the National Council be included in the explanation of the political program, and that the establishment of the National Planning Council be included in the political program. He said that the issue of the cabinet lineup has not yet been discussed, but the NU still requires the Masyumi Party to join the cabinet.

At the same time, the Central Committee of the NU announced the resolutions made at its recent expanded meeting. The resolution advocates for the establishment of a parliamentary cabinet without the participation of the Indonesian Communist Party; the National Council should be led by Sukarno, but this committee is only advisory in nature; it also advocates for the establishment of a National Planning and Construction Committee led by Hatta, to provide technical advice on construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 18th: The General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, Aidit, issued a statement today, pointing out that the resignation of the Ali Sastroamidjojo cabinet this time was due to the anti-democratic events of local coups and the disturbances of foreign subversion activities, rather than the cabinet being defeated in the parliament.

The statement said that Suwirjo's being commissioned to form a cabinet will be a test. The statement proposes that it is best to establish a cooperation cabinet conforming to the president's plan.

The statement believes that President Sukarno's declaration of a state of war and martial law nationwide is for national unity and to defend the country's order and system.

    苏加诺总统回到雅加达
    将接见苏维约听取筹组新阁的报告
    艾地主张成立符合总统方案的内阁
    据新华社雅加达18日电　苏加诺总统已经在今天中午从苏门答腊回到雅加达。
    一群示威游行的群众在机场上欢迎苏加诺，要求他讲话。苏加诺对他们说，他对不能成立合作内阁感到遗憾。他说，这是因为有几方面不同意成立这样的内阁，因此他指定苏维约组织一个能采取坚决和正确的措施的内阁。
    苏加诺将在今天下午接见组阁人苏维约，听取他筹组新阁的报告。
    据安塔拉通讯社消息：苏维约今天上午同伊斯兰教师联合会就组阁问题继续举行了会谈。苏维约说，就国民党方面说来，对于新阁的政纲、组织和人事计划已经准备就绪，现在要看看其他方面的意见。
    参加今天上午会谈的伊斯兰教师联合会的代表之一、这个党的副主席达兰在会后说，一般说来，他的党可以接受组阁人提出的内阁政纲草案，不过，他们提出了若干修正，即要求把关于民族委员会的任务列入政纲的说明中，同时把成立民族计划委员会列入政纲中。他说，关于内阁的阵容问题还没有讨论，但是，伊斯兰教师联合会仍然要求马斯友美党入阁。
    同时，伊斯兰教师联合会中央委员会公布了它在最近召开的扩大会议上所作出的决议。这个决议主张成立一个没有印度尼西亚共产党参加的议会内阁；民族委员会由苏加诺领导，但是这个委员会只是谘询性质的；它还主张成立一个由哈达领导的民族计划与建设委员会，提供有关建设方面的技术性建议。
    据新华社雅加达18日电　印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地今天发表声明指出，这次阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁辞职是由于发生了地方政变的反民主事件和外国颠复活动的扰乱，而不是由于内阁在国会中遭到失败。
    声明说，苏维约的受命组阁将是一次考验。声明提出，最好是成立符合总统方案所主张的合作内阁。
    声明认为，苏加诺总统宣布全国处于战争和戒严状态是为了民族团结和保卫国家的秩序和体制。
