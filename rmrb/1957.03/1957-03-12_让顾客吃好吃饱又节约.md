    Let Customers Eat Well, Eat Their Fill, and Save Money
    There is a restaurant on the Xin'an-Huangchuan Highway that is most popular with travelers – the Zhongshanpu Cooperative Restaurant. The customers traveling on this highway are mostly cart pullers and peddlers, who like to eat food that is varied, tastes good, costs little, and fills them up. The staff of this restaurant, based on the characteristics of these customers, devised many ways to improve the food supply. They used more than a dozen local products such as red and white radishes, tofu, cabbage, vermicelli, sweet potatoes, chicken, and fish, to make sweet potato sugar cakes, large stuffed buns, dumplings, sweet potato dried rice, and eighteen other kinds of dishes. Most of these dishes are "locally sourced," making prices particularly cheap; they are meticulously prepared, making the food taste very delicious. For example, their slippery fish soup sells for only one dime per bowl, because the fish is fresh, the taste is delicious, and the soup is hot, people who come here to eat all like to drink this soup. For example, when they make sweet potato dried rice, they first wash the sand out of the rice, then select sweet potatoes that are not bitter or rotten, peel them, cut them into half-ounce pieces, and steam them with the rice. The steamed sweet potato dried rice is fragrant and delicious, not only popular with customers, but also saves forty pounds of rice per day compared to using only plain rice.

    让顾客吃好吃饱又节约
    河南信潢公路上有一家最受来往旅客欢迎的饭店——中山铺合作饭店。在这条公路上来往的顾客，大都是拉车工人和肩挑小贩，他们喜欢吃花样多、味道好、花钱少又吃得饱的饭菜。这个饭店的人员，根据来往顾客的这个特点，想了许多法子改进饭食供应。他们利用当地出产的红白萝卜、豆腐、白菜、粉条、红薯、鸡、鱼等十几种东西，作出红薯糖糕、大馅包子、水饺、红薯干饭等十八种饭菜。这些饭菜大都是“就地取材”，价格特别便宜；他们制作得很精细，使饭菜的味道很鲜美。例如他们卖的滑鱼汤，每碗只一角钱，因为鱼鲜、味美、汤热，到这里来吃饭的人都喜欢喝这种汤。又如他们作红薯干饭的时候，先把米里的砂子淘净，然后挑选不苦不烂的红薯，把皮削去，切成半两大小的小块，同饭蒸在一起，蒸好的红薯干饭香甜可口，不但受到顾客欢迎，而且还比过去只用净米作饭时每天节约大米四十斤。
