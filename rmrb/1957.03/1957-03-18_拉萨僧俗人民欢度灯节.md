    Lhasa Monks and Lay People Celebrate the Butter Lamp Festival
    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, March 17th (By Xinhua reporter Yuan Dingqian) - Last night, Lhasa was brightly lit and crowded with people. Tens of thousands of monks and lay people celebrated the annual Butter Lamp Festival.
    At nightfall, hundreds of colorful arches were erected on the Barkhor Street surrounding the Jokhang Temple. Each arch was decorated with colorful butter sculptures of various vibrant flowers, fruits, and Buddha images. Rows of enormous copper butter lamps illuminated these arches. In the evening, the Barkhor Street's alleyways and the rooftops and windows of houses along the street were filled with people watching the lights. According to traditional custom, the Kalon and other high-ranking officials of the Tibetan local government first circled the Barkhor Street to view the lights and comment on which family's decorations were the best. Then, thousands of citizens and farmers and herdsmen who had come from various places crowded into the brightly lit streets from their homes and alleys. Late into the night, the joyous crowds continued to sing and dance in the streets.
    The Butter Lamp Festival is held annually on the fifteenth day of the first month of the Tibetan calendar. It is a part of the Great Prayer Festival and the Tibetan New Year activities, and it means offering lamps to the Buddha. According to legend, the Butter Lamp Festival was founded by Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Gelug sect, around the end of the Yuan Dynasty and the beginning of the Ming Dynasty.

    拉萨僧俗人民欢度灯节
    新华社拉萨17日电　新华社记者袁定乾报道：昨天晚上拉萨市灯火辉煌、人山人海，数万僧俗人民欢度了每年一度的灯节。
    入夜，在围绕大昭寺的八角街上，竖立起上百个彩牌，每个彩牌上都用彩色酥油塑造了各种鲜艳的花卉、仙果和佛像，一排排巨大的铜质酥油灯把这些彩牌照得通明。傍晚，八角街各个巷口和沿街房屋的屋顶平台和窗口上，都聚集着观灯的群众。按照传统习惯，西藏地方政府的噶伦和其他高级官员们首先环绕八角街一周观灯，并评论了那家的灯布置最好。接着成千上万的市民和各地赶来的农牧民，从自己家里和街头巷尾拥挤到灯火辉煌的大街上。深夜，欢乐的人群还继续在街上歌舞。
    灯节在每年藏历正月十五日举行，它是传召大会和藏历新年活动的一部分，意思是燃灯供佛。相传，灯节是由黄教祖师宗喀巴创始，约在元末明初。
