Shadows of the American Economy

　　Average Debt of Over Four Thousand Dollars Per Person
    According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the current public and private debt in the United States is $769 billion, almost double the U.S. gross national product in 1956—$412 billion. Averaged per capita, each American owes $4,650.
    Another Large Department Store Closes
    The Namm Department Store in Brooklyn, New York City, which had been in business for 71 years, recently announced its closure due to poor department store sales. According to the U.S. "Newsweek" on February 25, this is the eighth large department store in New York City to close in five years.
    Textile Industry in Recession
    The American textile industry has been hit by a continuous four-month recession. According to U.S. press reports, the Deering Milliken textile company has recently reduced its five spinning mills from six days to five days a week. The Bates Manufacturing Company in Maine closed its rayon textile mill. Another Berkshire Hathaway textile company is only utilizing 60% to 80% of its equipment capacity.
    Unemployment Increases by Over One Million Workers per Month
    In January, with a slight decline in U.S. industrial production and a housing construction slump, the number of unemployed nationwide increased by 1.7 million.
　  Automobile Manufacturing Reduces Raw Material Purchases
    Having learned a serious lesson from overproduction last year, the American automobile manufacturing industry is currently carefully "living within its means": controlling production according to sales volume. Therefore, they have all reduced their purchases of raw materials for manufacturing automobiles, such as steel, aluminum, glass, and tires. However, the result has caused anxiety among these automobile raw material suppliers, especially the steel industry. (Zhen)

　　美国经济的暗影
　  平均每人负债四千多美元
    据美国商务部透露，目前美国的公私债务是七千六百九十亿美元，几乎等于美国1956年国民生产总值——四千一百二十亿美元的二倍。按人口平均，每个美国人负债四千六百五十美元。
    又一家大百货公司倒闭
    在纽约市布鲁克林区开业已有七十一年的纳姆百货公司最近宣告歇业，原因是百货销售不景气。据2月25日美国“新闻周刊”报道，这是五年中纽约市歇业的第八个大百货公司。
    纺织工业不景气
    美国纺织业已遭受到连续四个月的不景气的袭击。据美国报刊的报道，最近美国第戎·米里肯纺织公司已把它的五个纺纱厂由每周开工六天缩减为五天。缅因州的巴提斯成衣制造公司关闭了它的一个人造丝纺织厂。又一家伯开夏·哈塞威纺织公司则只动用了它的设备能力的60％到80％。
    失业工人月增百多万
    1月份，在美国工业生产微趋下降和房屋建筑不景气的情况下，全国失业者增加了一百七十万人。
　  汽车制造业减少购买原料
    美国汽车制造业在受到去年生产过剩的严重教训以后，目前正在小心翼翼地“量出为入”：按照销售量来控制生产。因此，它们都削减了对钢铁、铝、玻璃、轮胎这类制造汽车原料的购进。但是结果却引起了这些汽车原料供应者、特别是钢铁工业的不安。　（振）
