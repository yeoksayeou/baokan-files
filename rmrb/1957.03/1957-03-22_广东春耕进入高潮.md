Guangdong Spring Plowing Enters Climax

(Our correspondent Lin Li, Huang Xiangqing reports) The spring plowing production movement in Guangdong Province has entered a tense stage of sowing and transplanting rice seedlings. A warm mass production upsurge has initially formed. Currently, the attendance rate of agricultural cooperatives in various regions has reached over 80%, with some areas reaching 95%. By March 13th, the amount of accumulated fertilizer had reached 2 billion dan (1 dan = 50 kg), with higher quality than last year. Of the planned small-scale water conservancy projects, totaling over 125,000, over 80% have commenced, with 61% completed. Of the large-scale water conservancy projects costing over 20,000 yuan, 427 have commenced. In Hainan Island, where the spring plowing season starts earlier, 57% of the arable land has completed rice transplanting. In the Chao-Shan Plain in the east, most areas have completed sowing. In the Pearl River Delta, counties like Panyu, Xinhui, and Zhongshan have sown 80% of the spring sowing land. Afforestation and tree planting, which had been progressing slowly, have also completed half of the spring tasks.

With the enthusiastic development of the production movement, various regions have repeatedly revised and improved their production increase plans and specific targets. The Shantou area, which has always relied on grain imports from other regions, has now put forward the goal of "striving for grain self-sufficiency." The Shaoguan area originally planned to accumulate an average of 30 dan of fertilizer per mu (1 mu ≈ 0.16 acres), but now strives for an average of 50 dan per mu.

The great achievements of the spring plowing movement in Guangdong Province in such a short period are due to the fact that tens of thousands of cadres went to the countryside, which strongly promoted production. These cadres who went to the countryside generally carried forward the "three togethers" style of "eating, living, and working together" with the peasants during the land reform period, and were able to effectively help the agricultural cooperatives where they were located to do a good job in spring plowing production. For example, the cadres in Longgui District, Qujiang County, each carried a manure basket and a hoe, and went deep into the fields to take the lead in labor. Therefore, the peasants in various regions were deeply moved and increased their confidence in striving for a bumper harvest this year. Some peasants who originally requested to withdraw from the cooperative have now returned one after another.

The People's Liberation Army stationed in various parts of Guangdong has also successively plunged into the spring plowing production upsurge. Starting from March 6th, the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in the Chao-Shan Plain stopped training and decided to spend fourteen days helping peasants accumulate fertilizer and repair water conservancy facilities. The troops stationed on the Leizhou Peninsula participated in the construction of more than 20 local farmland water conservancy projects. The cadres of the Guangdong Province and Guangzhou Municipality also formed an army of 10,000 people for voluntary labor on March 12th. They went to the suburbs of Guangzhou and the nearby nine counties and will voluntarily help peasants work for half a month.

    广东春耕进入高潮
    本报讯　本报记者林里、黄向青报道：广东省的春耕生产运动，已进入播种、插秧的紧张阶段。一个热烈的群众性的生产高潮，已经初步形成。现在各地农业社出勤人员已达80％以上，部分地区达到95％；到3月13日，积肥量已达二十亿担，质量比去年高；计划中的小型水利工程十二万五千多宗，有80％以上已开工，完工的也占61％；二万元以上的大型水利工程，开工的有四百二十七项。春耕季节较早的海南岛，57％的耕地已完成了插秧工作。在东部的潮汕平原上，大部地区已完成了播种任务。珠江三角洲的番禺、新会、中山等县，播种已达春播土地的80％。进展较慢的造林植树，也完成了春季任务的一半。
    随着生产运动的热烈发展，各地一再地修改和提高增产计划和具体指标。向来依靠外区调入粮食的汕头专区，现在提出“争取粮食自给”的奋斗目标。韶关地区原计划平均每亩积肥三十担，现在争取每亩平均五十担。
    广东省的春耕运动，在短短的时间内取得这样大的成绩，是由于数万名干部下乡，有力地推动了生产。这些下乡干部一般都发扬了土地改革时期跟农民“同吃、同住、同劳动”的“三同”作风，都能切实地帮助所在农业社搞好春耕生产工作。如曲江县龙归区的下乡干部，每人都带着一担粪箕、一把锄头，深入田间带头劳动。因此，各地农民都深受感动，提高了争取今年大丰收的信心。有些原来要求退社的农民，现在也都纷纷回来了。
    驻在广东各地的人民解放军，也先后投入春耕生产热潮。潮汕平原的解放军官兵，从3月6日起停止训练，决定以十四天的时间，帮助农民积肥修水利。雷州半岛上的驻军，参加了当地二十多项农田水利工程的兴建工作。广东省和广州市一级的机关干部，也在3月12日组成了一支拥有万人的义务劳动大军，他们下到广州郊区和附近九个县，将义务帮助农民劳动半个月。
