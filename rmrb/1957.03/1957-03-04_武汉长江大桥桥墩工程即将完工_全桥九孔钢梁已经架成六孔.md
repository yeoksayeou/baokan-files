Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 3rd: Six of the eight bridge piers of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge have been fully completed, and the other two have begun and are about to begin pouring concrete for the "pier cap." The entire pier project is expected to be completed around the 10th of this month.

The news that the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge pier project is nearing completion is increasingly attracting the attention of the people of Wuhan. In recent days, people have often been seen in groups going to Guishan in Hanyang, the areas near the bridgehead construction sites on both sides of the Yangtze River, or directly to the construction sites to observe the construction of the pier project. On the ferry boats traveling between Hankou and Wuchang, passengers can also often be seen eagerly looking at the water construction area of the bridge construction site and estimating the completion date of the final two piers.

As the pier project nears completion, the water construction area of the Yangtze River Bridge is far less tense and busy than in the past. There are far fewer construction machines and ships transporting building materials on the river surface than before. Some of the machines were transferred not long ago to support the construction of the Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise and the Yibin Minjiang Bridge. The leaders of the Engineering Bureau have also shifted their main attention from building piers to erecting steel beams and other work. The work that needs to be done on the pier project is not only little but also not difficult to do.

The construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge pier project has proceeded smoothly. From the start of construction to the present, people have only spent less than a year and a half. This is the result of the builders successfully using the new construction method – the "large tubular column drilling method" – in the pier project. Currently, the Chinese and Soviet bridge experts here are summarizing this new method.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 3rd: The steel beams of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge have been erected from the banks of Hanyang and Wuchang to the newly built No. 4 and No. 7 piers. By the end of February, six of the nine steel梁 spans of the entire bridge had been fully erected.

Since solving the key problem of steel梁 riveting quality failing to meet national requirements in October last year, the steel梁 erection project of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge has entered a period of very smooth progress. In recent months, the steel梁 erection engineers and workers have been continuously improving the riveting quality and promoting the assembly work in big strides based on summarizing and promoting the advanced operating experiences of workers such as Song Dazhen and Liu Maolin. In February, the riveting quality of all groups generally reached the national standard or above, and the assembly speed also increased by about two times compared to when the steel梁 erection began.

In line with the progress of steel beam erection, the installation of the highway bridge deck is also proceeding smoothly. At present, three spans have been installed on the Hanyang side, and one span has been installed on the Wuchang side. The railways connecting the bridgeheads on both sides have long been able to pass material trains; the roadbed of the highway connecting the bridgeheads has also been basically built, and the road surface paving project can begin soon.

### 武汉长江大桥桥墩工程即将完工  全桥九孔钢梁已经架成六孔

    武汉长江大桥桥墩工程即将完工
    全桥九孔钢梁已经架成六孔
    新华社武汉3日电  武汉长江大桥的八个桥墩中，有六个已经全部建成，另外两个也已经开始和即将开始灌注“墩帽”混凝土。整个桥墩工程预计在10日左右就可以全部完工。
    武汉长江大桥桥墩工程将要全部完工的消息，正日益广泛地吸引着武汉人民的注意。最近这些日子里，经常都有人成群结队地到汉阳龟山、长江两岸桥头工地附近地段，或者直接到工地去，观赏桥墩工程的施工景象。在汉口、武昌间往返的渡江轮船上，也经常可以看到乘客们兴致勃勃地一面远眺大桥工地的水上工区，一面在估算最后两个桥墩的完工日期。
    随着桥墩工程即将完工，长江大桥的水上工区已经远不如过去那样紧张繁忙了。江面上的施工机具和运送建筑材料的船只比过去减少了许多。有一部分机具已经在不久以前抽去支援武汉钢铁联合企业和宜宾岷江大桥的建设。工程局的领导方面，也已经把主要注意力由修筑桥墩转移到架设钢梁和其他工作上去。在桥墩工程方面需要做的工作不仅很少，而且已不是什么难做的了。
    武汉长江大桥的桥墩工程施工进行得很顺利。从开工到现在，人们只不过用了还不到一年半的时间。这是建设者们在桥墩工程中成功地运用了新的施工方法——“大型管柱钻孔法”的结果。目前，这里的中、苏桥梁专家们正在对这种新方法进行总结。
    新华社武汉3日电  武汉长江大桥的钢梁已经从汉阳、武昌两岸分别架到刚建成不久的四号和七号桥墩。到2月底止，全桥九孔钢梁有六孔已经全部架成。
    自从在去年10月间把钢梁铆合质量达不到国家要求这个关键问题解决以后，武汉长江大桥的架梁工程就进入了进展十分顺利的时期。几个月来，架梁工程人员和工人一起，在总结和推广工人宋大振和刘茂林等人的先进操作经验的基础上，不断地提高着铆合质量，并且推动拼装工作大踏步地前进。2月份，各小组的铆合质量都普遍达到国家要求的标准以上，拼装速度也比开始架梁的时候提高了两倍左右。
    同钢梁架设进度相适应，公路桥桥面板的安装工作也在顺利地进行。目前，汉阳岸已经安装完三孔，武昌岸安装好了一孔。两岸联接桥头的铁路早已可以通行材料列车；联接桥头的公路路基也已经基本上筑好，铺设路面的工程不久可开始。
