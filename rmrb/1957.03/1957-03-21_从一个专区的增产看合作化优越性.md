Seeing the Superiority of Cooperation from Increased Production in One Special District

Leng Yindong said that although the Jiangjin Special District of Sichuan Province suffered severe disasters such as floods, droughts, winds, hail, and rice borers last year, the increased output of various crops still exceeded the total increase in production in the previous two years.
I sincerely support Chairman Mao's instructions at the Supreme State Conference and Premier Zhou's report at the CPPCC meeting. These reports have increased my understanding and strengthened my resolve. I am willing to contribute all my strength to the cause of socialist construction at my job.
Under the wise and correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I have a hundredfold confidence that our country will achieve industrialization in three five-year plans or a little more, fundamentally changing the backward state of our economy and culture. However, our country is an agricultural country, and agriculture has a great impact on all aspects of the national economy. To accelerate the early realization of socialist construction, we must actively develop agriculture, and increased agricultural production must mainly rely on cooperation. Not long ago, some people doubted the superiority of cooperation and whether cooperatives would increase production. Now, I will speak on the agricultural production increase in the Jiangjin Special District of Sichuan Province as follows.
Sichuan Province is a grain-producing area in the whole country, and Jiangjin Special District in Sichuan is also a grain-producing area. The area of the entire district is 11,136,330 mu, of which 7,247,439 mu are paddy fields and 3,888,894 mu are dry land, but most of them are hilly areas and there are many winter water fields. As of the end of last December, 16,744 agricultural production cooperatives had been developed in the district, with 1,258,197 households joining the cooperatives, accounting for 96.8% of the 1,299,131 households in the district. Among them, there are 16,107 advanced cooperatives, with 1,230,772 member households, accounting for 97.7% of the households joining the cooperatives and 94.69% of the total number of households, basically completing advanced cooperation.
Accompanying the high tide of agricultural cooperation was a high tide of agricultural production. In 1956, our district produced more than 5.27 billion jin of grain, an increase of 13.88% (an increase of 630 million jin of grain) compared to 1955, exceeding the target of the first five-year plan set by the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee (an increase of 34.38% on the basis of 1952, exceeding the target of the five-year plan by 7.5%).
The completion of several major grain crops:
　　Rice: 3,356,210,000 jin produced, an increase of 10.9% compared with 1955 (3,193,010,000 jin of early and mid-season rice, 16,632,000 jin of late rice);
　　Sorghum: 118,180,000 jin produced, an increase of 10.14%;
　　Potatoes: 658,510,000 jin produced, an increase of 43.44% (four jin converted to one jin of raw grain);
　　Small spring grains: 600,540,000 jin produced, an increase of 37.69% (320,370,000 jin of wheat, an increase of 25.31%; 184,530,000 jin of broad beans, an increase of 52%).
The average yield of grain per mu was 561.9 jin, an increase of 16% compared to 1955 (of which four state-owned farms and two cooperatives produced more than 1,000 jin per mu). In terms of sideline production:
　　Pigs: Developed to 2,089,245 heads (an average of 1.607 heads per household), an increase of 8.92% compared to 1955;
　　Cattle: Yellow cattle developed to 30,403 heads, maintaining the 1955 level. Water buffalo developed to 363,070 heads, an increase of 5%;
　　Goats: Developed to 281,669 heads, an increase of 33.6%.
The number of other small poultry also increased from an average of four per household in 1955 to about seven per household. 88,511 sheets of silkworms were raised, an increase of 3.58% compared to 1955, and 3,200,560 jin of cocoons were harvested (slightly less than in 1955 due to lack of mulberry leaves). 109,360 jin of tussah silkworm cocoons were produced, an increase of 2.83 times compared to 1955.
In 1956, our special district suffered various natural disasters such as floods, droughts, wind, hail, and rice borers, which were rare in history. Although the affected area and the degree of disaster were serious, we were still able to achieve the above-mentioned production increase, mainly due to the following reasons: 1. Relying on the development of agricultural cooperation, implementing various production increase measures, and vigorously overcoming natural disasters. 2. Changing the cultivation system and adopting various advanced technical measures. 3. Improving work methods and further giving play to the enthusiasm of cadres.
Judging from the production increase in our special district in recent years, before cooperation, grain production in 1953 increased by 5.16% compared to 1952, 8.9% in 1954 compared to 1953, and 3.3% in 1955 compared to 1954. The increase was not large. However, after cooperation, although we encountered severe disasters such as floods, droughts, wind, hail, and rice borers, production increased by 13.88%, exceeding the total increase in production in 1954 and 1955. This shows that the policy of accelerating the realization of agricultural cooperation is completely correct and is of decisive significance for ensuring increased production.
After our special district realized cooperation, the peasants in the entire district, encouraged by the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), worked actively, grain output grew year by year, and the actual income of peasants also increased rapidly, so their lives are also constantly improving. Looking at the situation of 61 households in Xishan Village, Gujian Township, Qijiang County, our special district, which is a mountainous area: before liberation, the average income per person per year was 187 jin of rice. The whole village had 24 cotton quilts and 63 hemp quilts, and 5 households used palm clothing. In recent years, thanks to government relief and support, in 1956, the average distribution of rice per person in the whole village was 250 jin. There are now 125 cotton quilts, 63 cotton shirts, 78 pairs of leather shoes, 35 flashlights, and 48 pens. Generally, people wear cotton clothes and cover themselves with cotton quilts, changing the face of the mountainous area. The improvement and increase in the lives of peasants in other flat and hilly areas should be better than that of peasants in mountainous areas. This clearly proves the great superiority of the socialist system.
Although we have achieved certain results on the agricultural production front and have summed up a lot of experience, there are also the following shortcomings and errors due to our ideological level not meeting the requirements of the development of the situation: 1. Our leadership style has subjectivism and commandism. In promoting advanced production increase measures, we do not have enough understanding of the spirit of adapting to local conditions and adapting to the times. We have promoted some things that are not suitable for specific situations. For example, when sowing early rice, we did not consider the historical spring drought in our special district and the slow germination and growth of dry seedlings at low temperatures, and we demanded the universal cultivation of dry seedlings, resulting in a large number of seeds not germinating after sowing, and serious abuse of seedlings, causing losses of manpower and materials. More than 500,000 mu of late rice were also planted after the beginning of autumn, resulting in poor results and some opinions among the masses. 2. Because the work of technology transfer and guidance is not deep and meticulous enough, the requirements for technical specifications are not strict, and the coordination of labor is not compact and flexible, many technologies and measures are implemented poorly, with little or no effect. For example, the characteristics of the fertilizer-loving and densely planted high-quality variety of Yinfang Japonica rice are not well understood, and many places are planted in poor fields and ridges, resulting in reduced production. 3. Some community cadres have weak leadership skills, and there are some problems and shortcomings in production planning, management systems, and work methods, causing some dissatisfaction among some of the masses. However, we believe that the above problems can be overcome and solved in the future under the leadership of the Party, relying on the masses, and implementing the principles of democratic and thrifty community management.
According to the needs of the country, agricultural production in our special district in 1957 will continue to implement the policy of focusing on increasing grain production and properly coordinating the production of technical and economic crops, requiring an increase of 8.57% or 480 million jin on the basis of 1956, with a total output of 5.75 billion jin. Although it is arduous to complete the task of increasing production in 1957, it is possible to complete it. First of all, more than 94% of farmers have joined advanced cooperatives, the socialist consciousness of the masses has been improved, the spirit of collectivism has been strengthened, and the enthusiasm for production has been increased. Secondly, after a year of large-scale production movements, cadres and the masses have explored richer experiences in increasing production. Third, water conservancy has been guaranteed to a certain extent (the water storage in ponds and dams is better than last year). Fourth, due to the increase in fattened pigs and draft animals, fertilizer will be increased to some extent. Fifth, sufficient preparations have been made for high-quality seeds.
In order to ensure the completion of the task of increasing production in 1957, we have also taken the following specific measures: 1. Appropriately expand the multiple cropping area; 2. Build water conservancy projects and do a good job in water storage and conservation; 3. Increase fertilizer accumulation; 4. Prevent and control pests and diseases; 5. Increase the yield per unit area; 6. Continue to vigorously promote and improve advanced production technologies; 7. Process the land and improve the soil. Therefore, we are more confident to strive to overfulfill the agricultural production task in 1957.

### 从一个专区的增产看合作化优越性

　　从一个专区的增产看合作化优越性
　  冷寅东说，四川省江津专区去年虽然遭受了严重的水、旱、风、雹和螟虫等灾害，但各种作物增加的产量仍然超过前两年增产的总和。
    我衷诚拥护毛主席在最高国务会议的指示和周总理在政协会议上的报告。这些报告使我认识提高了，力量增大了。我愿站在自己的工作岗位上为社会主义建设事业贡献出所有的力量。
    我国在共产党和毛主席的英明正确领导下，在三个五年计划或更多一点的时间内实现工业化，从根本上改变我国经济和文化的落后面貌是有百倍信心的。唯我国是一个农业国，而农业对国民经济各方面都有很大影响，欲加速社会主义建设事业之提早实现，必须积极发展农业，而农业之增产又须主要依靠于合作化。在不久以前，有些人怀疑合作化的优越性，怀疑合作社是否增产。现在我就四川省江津专区农业增产的情况作如下的发言。
    四川省在全国范围来说，是一个产粮食的地区，而江津专区就四川而言亦是一个产粮食的区域，全区面积11，136，330亩，其中田7，247，439亩，土3，888，894亩，但多系丘陵地且冬水田很多。截至去年12月底止，全区农业生产合作社已发展16，744个，入社农户达1，258，197户，占全区农户1，299，131户的96.8％。其中高级社为16，107个，社员户为1，230，772户，占入社农户的97.7％，占总农户的94.69％，基本上完成了高级合作化。
    伴随农业合作化高潮而掀起农业生产高潮。1956年我区共产粮食五十二亿七千多万斤，比1955年增产13.88％（增产粮食六亿三千万斤），超额完成四川省人民委员会所规定的第一个五年计划的指标（在1952年基础上增产34.38％，超过五年计划的指标7.5％）。
    几种主要粮食作物的完成情况：
    水稻：共产335，621万斤，比1955年增产10.9％（早、中稻319，301万斤，晚稻16，632万斤）；
    高粱：共产11，818万斤，增产10.14％；
    薯类：共产65，851万斤，增产43.44％（四斤折一斤原粮）；
    小春：共产60，054万斤，增产37.69％（小麦32，037万斤，增产25.31％；胡豆18，453万斤，增产52％）。
    平均每亩产粮食561.9斤，比1955年提高16％（其中有四个国营农场、二个合作社每亩产1，000斤以上）。副业生产方面：
    猪：发展到2，089，245头（平均每户1.607头），比1955年增加8.92％；
    耕牛：黄牛发展到30，403头，保持1955年水平。水牛发展到363，070头，增加5％；
    山羊：发展到281，669头，增加33.6％。
    其他小家禽亦由1955年平均每户四只增加为每户七只左右。养蚕88，511张，比1955年增加3.58％，收茧3，200，560斤（因缺桑叶所以比1955年略有减产），产柞蚕茧109，360斤，比1955年增加2.83倍。
    1956年我们专区遭受了历史上少有之水、旱、风雹、螟虫等各种自然灾害，受灾面积和受灾程度虽然严重，但仍能获得以上增产成绩，其主要有以下原因：1．依靠农业合作化的发展，贯彻各项增产措施，大力战胜自然灾害。2．改变耕作制度，采用各种先进技术措施。3．改进工作方法，进一步发挥干部的工作积极性。
    从我们专区几年来增产的情况看，合作化以前，1953年粮食比1952年增产5.16％，1954年比1953年增产8.9％，1955年比1954年增产3.3％，增产的幅度不大。但在合作化以后，虽遭遇到严重的水、旱、风雹、螟虫等灾害，却增产13.88％，超过1954年和1955年两年增产的总和。这就说明了加速实现农业合作化的方针是完全正确的，对于保证增产是有决定意义的。
    我们专区在实现合作化以后，全区农民在全国农业发展纲要（草案）的鼓舞下积极地劳动，粮食产量逐年增长，农民的实际收入也有着迅速的增加，因而生活亦在不断的提高改善。就我们专区綦江县之山区古剑乡西山村六十一户的情况看：解放前每人每年收入水稻一百八十七斤，全村共有棉被二十四床，麻皮被六十三床，五户盖棕衣。年来由于政府的救济扶持，在1956年度全村每人平均分水稻二百五十斤，现有棉被一百二十五床，线衣六十三件，皮胶鞋七十八双，电筒三十五只，钢笔四十八只，一般穿上了棉衣，盖上了棉被，改变了山区的面貌。其他平地和丘陵地区的农民生活之改善提高，当更好于山区农民，这就很显著的证明了社会主义制度的巨大优越性。
    我们在农业生产战线上虽取得了一定的成绩，总结了不少的经验，但由于我们思想水平赶不上形势发展的要求，也存在着下面的缺点和错误：1．我们领导作风上有主观主义和命令主义，在推广先进增产措施中，对因地制宜、因时制宜的精神体会不够，推广了一些不适合于具体情况的东西，如播种早稻，没有考虑到我们专区有历史性春旱以及旱秧在低温下发芽生长缓慢的特点，而要求普遍育旱秧，以致播种后，大量谷种不发芽，滥秧严重，造成人力、物力的损失。又于立秋后还栽了五十多万亩的晚稻，以致结果不好，群众中有些意见。2．由于技术传授和指导工作做得不够深入、细致，对技术规格的要求不严格，劳动力配合不紧凑、灵活，因此有好些技术和措施做走了样，效果不大，或者不好。如把喜肥田、喜密植等很好的品种银坊粳稻的特点掌握不够，不少的地方栽到瘦田和塝田里，因此减产。3．有个别社干因领导能力薄弱，在生产规划及经营管理制度和工作方法各方面，都存在着一些问题和缺点，使部分群众有些不满。但上述问题，我们相信，今后在党的领导下认真依靠群众，贯彻民主办社和勤俭办社的方针，是能够克服解决的。
    根据国家的需要，我们专区1957年农业生产仍贯彻以增产粮食为中心并恰当的统筹安排技术、经济作物生产的方针，要求在1956年基础上增产8.57％即4.8亿斤，总产量达到57.5亿斤。完成1957年的增产任务虽是艰巨的，但是可能完成的。首先，94％以上的农户加入了高级社，群众的社会主义觉悟有了提高，集体主义思想加强了，生产积极性提高了。其次，经过一年来的大生产运动，干部和群众已摸索了更丰富的增产经验。第三，水利已有了一定的保证（塘堰蓄水比去年好）。第四，由于毛猪耕畜的增加，肥料已将有所增加。第五，优良种籽也有了充分准备。
    我们为了保证1957年增产任务的完成，更采取了如下之具体措施：1．适当扩大复种面积；2．兴修水利，作好蓄水保水；3．增积肥料；4．防治病虫害；5．提高单位面积产量；6．继续大力推广和提高先进生产技术；7．进行土地加工，改良土壤。因此，我们更有信心争取超额完成1957年的农业生产任务。
    以上发言，请予以指正。（附图片）
