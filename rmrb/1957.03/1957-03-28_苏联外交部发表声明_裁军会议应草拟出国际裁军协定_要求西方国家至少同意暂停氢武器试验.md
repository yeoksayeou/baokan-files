Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 27th: TASS reports: On March 26th, the spokesperson for the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying that the subcommittee meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Commission, currently being held in London, should take practical actions to draft an international disarmament agreement acceptable to all parties. The statement also indicated that if Western countries find it unacceptable to accept the Soviet Union's earlier proposal to immediately cease testing atomic and hydrogen weapons, the Soviet government is willing to conclude an agreement to temporarily suspend testing these weapons.

The statement was released at a reception held by the Information Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Soviet and foreign journalists. The statement said that the London conference should make a positive contribution to drafting an agreement on the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons and a significant reduction of armed forces and armaments. The Soviet Union hopes that this conference can be a turning point, shifting the disarmament issue from meaningless empty discussions to practical actions by all countries. It should focus its attention on the substance of the issue, namely, drafting a specific plan for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons and the reduction of national armed forces and armaments.

When discussing the issue of ceasing the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, the statement said that the just demands of people from all countries to cease the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons can no longer be ignored. The Soviet government believes that it is best to separate this issue from the entire disarmament issue and resolve it separately now.

The statement pointed out that because Western countries have not accepted the Soviet Union's proposal, put forward at the United Nations General Assembly, to immediately cease testing atomic and hydrogen weapons, this issue has remained unresolved, with the Soviet proposal merely being transferred to the subcommittee for consideration. The Soviet government believes that accepting this proposal would fundamentally resolve the issue of prohibiting the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons. However, if Western countries find it unacceptable to accept the aforementioned proposal by the Soviet Union, the Soviet government is also willing to conclude an agreement to suspend such tests, that is, to temporarily suspend such tests for an appropriate period.

The statement then pointed out that the Japanese government recently, in a note to the governments of the Soviet Union and other countries, requested the cessation of all atomic and hydrogen weapon tests in the future. The Soviet Union has stated many times that it is willing to immediately conclude an agreement on the cessation of testing. The responsibility for the failure to sign such an agreement to date rests entirely outside the Soviet Union. At this London conference, the Soviet representative will also make every effort to achieve a positive decision on the issue of ceasing the testing of weapons of mass destruction.

Regarding the suggestions put forward by Japan and certain other countries on the pre-registration of atomic and hydrogen explosion tests, the statement said that this approach does not solve the fundamental problem of eliminating the harmful effects of atomic and hydrogen explosions on human health.

The statement concluded by saying that the Japanese government's appeal to the Soviet government gives reason to believe that the Soviet Union's proposal to permanently or at least temporarily cease the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons will receive the support of the Japanese government.

### 苏联外交部发表声明　裁军会议应草拟出国际裁军协定　要求西方国家至少同意暂停氢武器试验

    苏联外交部发表声明
　　裁军会议应草拟出国际裁军协定
　　要求西方国家至少同意暂停氢武器试验
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部发言人3月26日发表声明说，现在在伦敦开会的联合国裁军委员会小组委员会会议应当采取实际行动，草拟一项各方面都可以接受的国际裁军协定。声明还表示，如果西方国家认为不能接受苏联早先提出的立即停止试验原子武器和氢武器的建议，苏联政府还愿意缔结一项暂时中止试验这些武器的协定。
    这个声明是在苏联外交部新闻司为苏联和外国新闻记者举行的招待会上发表的。声明说，伦敦会议应该对草拟关于禁止原子武器和氢武器以及大大裁减武装部队和军备问题的协定作出良好的贡献。苏联希望，这次会议能是一个转折点，它能使裁军问题从无谓的空洞讨论转到各国的实际行动方面去。它应当把注意力集中在问题的实质上，即草拟一项关于禁止原子武器和氢武器、裁减各国武装部队和军备的具体方案。
    在谈到停止试验原子武器和氢武器的问题的时候，声明说，再不能对各国人民要求停止试验原子武器和氢武器的正义要求置之不理了。苏联政府认为，最好是把这个问题同整个裁军问题分开来，而且现在就单独地来解决。
    声明指出，由于西方国家没有接受苏联在联合国大会这一届会议上提出的立即停止试验原子武器和氢武器的建议，这个问题仍旧没有得到解决，只不过是把苏联的建议移交给小组委员会处理。苏联政府认为，接受这个建议，就可以根本解决禁止试验原子武器和氢武器的问题。但是，如果西方国家认为不能接受苏联提出的上述建议，苏联政府还愿意缔结一项中止这种试验，即规定适当期限暂时停止这种试验的协定。
    声明接着指出，日本政府最近在向苏联和其他一些国家的政府提出的照会中要求以后停止一切原子武器和氢武器的试验。苏联已经多次声明过，它愿意立即缔结关于停止试验的协定。这种协定迄今没有能签定其责任绝不在苏联。在这次伦敦会议上，苏联代表还将尽一切努力争取在停止试验大规模毁灭性武器问题上作出正面的决定。
    至于谈到日本和其他某些国家提出的关于预先登记原子爆炸和氢爆炸的试验的建议，声明说，这种做法并不能解决关于消除原子爆炸和氢爆炸对人的健康的有害影响这个根本问题。
    声明最后说，日本政府对苏联政府的呼吁使人有理由认为，苏联提出的关于永久停止、或者至少是暂时停止试验原子武器和氢武器的建议将得到日本政府的支持。
