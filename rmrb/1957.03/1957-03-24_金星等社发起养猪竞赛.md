    (Our report) The eighteen agricultural cooperatives, headed by the Jin Xing Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Cooperative of Xigou, Pingshun, Shanxi, have launched a pig-raising competition with all agricultural cooperatives in the Changzhi District. They proposed to raise the number of pigs from the original 6,069 to 30,535 this year, with an average of three pigs per household, an increase of two times the current number. Currently, 350 agricultural cooperatives and individuals have responded to the challenge.
