Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, March 22nd: Burmese Prime Minister U Nu and Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers Józef Cyrankiewicz stated in a joint statement on the 20th that they are convinced that world peace can be maintained and consolidated on the basis of respecting the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

The Polish government delegation, headed by Cyrankiewicz, visited Burma from March 18th to 21st. The joint Polish-Burmese statement, signed in Rangoon at the end of the visit, reiterated that the relations between Poland and Burma "will continue to be based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The two governments are deeply convinced that these five principles should be applied to the relations of all countries. To implement these principles, it is necessary to constantly and actively strive to resolve all outstanding international issues through peaceful cooperation among all countries for the common good, especially those issues that constitute the main sources of world tension, regardless of the political and social systems of these countries.”

The joint statement expressed deep regret over the policy of establishing military blocs and stated that it "sincerely believes that this policy of concluding military treaties will be abandoned and replaced by a collective security system in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter." The two governments emphasized "the need to prohibit the production, testing, and use of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons" and "general and large-scale reduction of conventional weapons." The two governments called for the establishment and maintenance of effective international supervision in the prohibition of nuclear weapons and disarmament.

The statement believes that "every effort must be made to support and strengthen the United Nations so that it can accomplish its primary task of maintaining peace and ensuring the security of all countries, large and small. The two governments stated that they firmly believe that the United Nations cannot fulfill its due responsibilities as long as the great Asian country, the People's Republic of China, has not obtained representation in the United Nations."

The statement said: "The policy of imperialism and the revival of any manifestation of the spirit and practice of colonialism are a cause of concern for all peace-loving countries because they threaten the cause of freedom and peace. The two governments are determined to oppose the resurgence of colonialism and to defend the cause of freedom and the right to self-determination of all countries."

The statement pointed out that the relations between Burma and Poland have become closer and more consolidated in recent years, and that in order to enhance this relationship, the issue of developing mutual relations in the economic, technological, and cultural fields has been considered.

    波缅两国政府领导人发表联合声明
　　确信和平能在共处原则基础上得到巩固
　　将进一步发展两国经济技术和文化关系
    新华社仰光22日电　缅甸总理吴努和波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹20日在一项联合声明中说，他们确信世界和平是能够在尊重和平共处的五项原则的基础上维护和巩固的。
    以西伦凯维兹为首的波兰政府代表团从3月18日到21日在缅甸进行了访问。访问结束时在仰光签署的波缅联合声明重申，波缅两国关系“将继续以和平共处的五项原则作为基础。两国政府深信，这五项原则应该应用到一切国家的关系上。要实行这些原则，就必须经常地积极努力，通过一切国家为了共同的利益而进行的和平合作来解决一切悬而未决的国际问题，特别是构成世界紧张局势主要根源的那些问题，不论这些国家的政治制度和社会制度有什么不同。”
    联合声明对建立军事集团的政策深感遗憾，并且表示“真诚地相信这种缔结军事条约的政策将会被抛弃，而代之以一种符合于联合国宪章的原则的集体安全体系”。两国政府强调“必须禁止生产、试验和使用核子和热核子武器”，“普遍而大规模地裁减常规武器”。两国政府要求在禁止核子武器和裁军方面建立并且维持一种有效的国际监督。
    声明认为，“必须进行一切努力来支持并且加强联合国，使它得以完成维持和平和保障不分大小一切国家的安全的首要任务。两国政府表示它们坚信，只要是伟大的亚洲国家中华人民共和国还没有获得在联合国的代表权，联合国就无法完成它应尽的职责。”
    声明说：“帝国主义的政策以及任何表现形式的殖民主义的精神和作法的复活，是一切爱好和平的国家所感到不安的事，因为它们威胁自由与和平的事业。两国政府决心反对殖民主义的再起并且维护自由的事业和一切国家的自决权利。”
    声明指出，缅甸和波兰之间的关系最近几年来已经更加密切和巩固，为了增进这种关系，已经考虑到了发展经济、技术和文化方面的相互关系的问题。
