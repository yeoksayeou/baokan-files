I fully endorse Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference, and Premier Zhou's report. I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's reports, as well as the special speeches of other responsible comrades.

In the seven years since liberation, we have passed the war hurdle, the land reform hurdle, and are now passing the socialist hurdle. Under the leadership of the Party, we have received class education and ideological methodology education. We should say that we have made progress. However, what we have done in the past mainly focused on distinguishing between ourselves and the enemy, and resolving the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy. After the high tide of the socialist revolution, the domestic political situation and class relations have undergone fundamental changes. How to distinguish between right and wrong, and how to correctly handle the contradictions among the people themselves? This is a new and prominent issue at present, and also a new issue in the history of social development, but we lack understanding and experience in this area. After listening to Chairman Mao's instructions, we have been greatly inspired and educated. Chairman Mao's speech not only developed and enriched Marxism-Leninism in theory, but also has very important practical guiding significance in practice. Chairman Mao taught us a formula: unity, criticism, unity. If we can truly start from the desire for unity, and if we can truly have persuasive criticism, clarify the principles, and be realistic, it will definitely be universally accepted within the people. Once the principles are clarified and right and wrong are distinguished, it will not be difficult to specifically implement them in practical life. The various contradictions such as right and wrong, new and old, same and different, knowing and doing, knowing and not knowing, subjective and objective, correct and incorrect, ultimately manifest in the different positions, viewpoints, and methods of observing, analyzing, and handling things. Position, viewpoint, and method are interrelated, and motive and effect are also combined. Therefore, I believe that strengthening ideological methodology education is as important as strengthening class education. How to correctly grasp the formula taught by Chairman Mao, and use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to solve the contradictions in the actual life of the people, the most important thing is to improve ideological methodology. Since last year, some events and problems have occurred at home and abroad. Many friends, including myself, have found it difficult to observe and analyze problems, see the essence, and distinguish the mainstream according to the Marxist ideological method in their views on certain issues. The bourgeois position, viewpoint, and method often unconsciously reflect from all aspects, which shows that our political study and theoretical study are not enough, and many friends feel the same way. Therefore, in the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions, strengthening study and striving for practice, breaking capitalism and establishing socialism ideologically, and consolidating the basic viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism within a few years, and constantly liberating the limitations of class and the limitations of understanding in the spiritual world, are still the efforts we should make in our self-transformation. We hope that the CPPCC and the democratic parties and people's organizations will continue to strengthen their work in this area.

The most concrete manifestation of the superiority of cooperation is its ability to exert collective strength to increase production. Last year, Hunan suffered the most severe drought in nearly a century. In the old society, the tragic scene of this drought was "thousands of miles of red land, starving people everywhere," but we were "thousands of miles of drought resistance, fighting for grain with the sky." It was precisely because of the realization of cooperation, relying on the hard work of the vast number of grassroots cadres and agricultural collectives, that the losses caused by the disaster were greatly reduced, and the total agricultural output of the province was roughly close to the level of 1955, and the peasants are still living and working in peace and contentment. The increased production facts of the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives across the country have affirmed the superiority of cooperatives. The problem now is not whether cooperatives have superiority, but how to consolidate cooperatives and further exert their superiority.

The various relationships under our new socialist system are relationships of mutual cooperation, mutual promotion, and mutual development, which are fundamentally different from the antagonistic relationships between exploitation and being exploited in the past. This relationship is the most favorable fundamental condition for developing production, but the actual situation of backward productivity limits the scale and speed of our current production development to a certain extent. If we do not see these two aspects of the contradiction that exists in the current objective reality, mistakes will occur. Our industrialization has a preliminary foundation, but our economy is still backward, and we suffer from both scarcity and unevenness. Therefore, I believe that in compiling the second five-year plan, we should focus on studying the proportional relationships in all aspects of the national economy. We should try to balance those contradictions that have already been exposed, and we should also consider rebalancing those relationships that have already been balanced. I think the proportional relationship between defense industry and civil industry should be carefully considered. The defense industry should be built on the basis of a strong civil industry, but important defense industries must have preliminary preparations. In terms of financial expenditure, we should implement the principle of "guaranteeing key points and appropriately compressing." We should comprehensively fulfill the increase in production and conservation, but necessary defense expenditures and scientific research expenditures must have appropriate guarantees. Regular inspection and supervision of the implementation of the plan by all parties should also be strengthened in order to discover problems and correct mistakes in a timely manner, so that the plan can be better and fully completed.

In cultural and educational work, there are still contradictions between need and possibility, quantity and quality. In particular, the phenomenon of excessive course load for university students still exists seriously. After the courses are streamlined, the actual burden of university students has not been reduced, and the main reason is that the foundation in middle school is not good. Therefore, the connection between the teaching quality of middle and universities is worth paying attention to.

In the past seven years, 600 million people across the country have embarked on the road of socialism. This is a comprehensive arrangement by the Communist Party for the overall consideration of the people of the whole country. Chairman Mao instructed us that "the core force leading our cause is the Chinese Communist Party. The theoretical basis guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism." We should better and constantly implement it in our practical work.

The current general trend in the world is towards relaxation and progress. The general situation in our country is thriving. As long as we resolutely rely on the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and strengthen the unity of national independence movements and peace forces, we will confidently continue to advance our country's socialist construction and the cause of human peace and progress!

    学习用马克思主义的思想方法分析问题
    唐生智的发言
    我完全拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话，和周总理的报告。完全同意李富春副总理和陈叔通副主席的报告，以及其他各位负责同志的专题发言。
    解放七年来，我们过了战争关、土改关，现在还在过社会主义关。在党的领导下，我们受到了阶级教育，也受到了思想方法的教育，应该说我们是有进步的。但我们过去所做的主要是分清敌我，解决敌我之间的矛盾，社会主义革命高潮之后，国内的政治形势和阶级关系起了根本的变化，如何分清是非，如何正确地处理人民内部相互之间的矛盾？这是当前一个新的突出的问题，也是社会发展史上的一个新问题，但是在这方面，我们还缺乏理解和经验。听了毛主席的指示以后，使我们得到了很大的启发和教育。毛主席的讲话不但在理论上发展和丰富了马克思列宁主义，而且在实践上有很重大的实际指导意义。毛主席教导了我们一个公式：团结、批评、团结。果然能够从团结的愿望出发，果然能够有说服力的批评，讲清道理，实事求是，在人民的内部是一定能够被普遍接受的，而道理一经讲通，是非一经明辨，就不难具体贯彻到实际生活中去。是与非、新与旧、同与异、知与行、知与不知、主观与客观、正确与不正确种种矛盾，归根结底总表现在观察、分析和处理事物的立场、观点、方法的不同。立场、观点、方法是相互联系的，动机和效果也是相结合的。所以我认为加强思想方法的教育与加强阶级教育是同等重要。如何正确地掌握毛主席教导我们的公式，运用批评和自我批评的武器，来解决人民内部实际生活中的矛盾，最重要的还是提高思想方法。去年以来，我们国内外发生了一些事件和问题，许多朋友，包括我在内，在某些问题的看法上，不容易按照马克思主义的思想方法来观察、分析问题，看清本质，辨别主流，资产阶级的立场、观点、方法，往往不自觉的从各方面反映出来，这就说明我们的政治学习和理论学习还很不够，许多朋友，都有同感。因此，本着毛主席指示的精神，加强学习，努力实践，在思想上破资本主义立社会主义，在几年之内，巩固地接受马列主义的基本观点，在精神世界里，不断地解放阶级的局限性和认识的局限性，仍是我们自我改造当中应有的努力。我们希望政协和各民主党派，人民团体继续加强这方面的工作。
    合作化的优越性最具体的表现，是它能够发挥集体的力量，来增加生产。去年湖南遭受了近百年来未有的严重旱灾，在旧社会，这种旱灾的惨象是“赤地千里，饿殍载道”，而我们则是“千里抗旱，与天争粮”，正是因为实现了合作化，依靠了广大基层干部和农业社集体的艰苦奋斗，使灾害的损失大大减轻，全省农业总产量大体仍与1955年的水平相接近，农民现在仍然是安居乐业。全国最大多数农业社的增产事实都肯定了合作社的优越性，现在的问题不是合作社有没有优越性的问题，而是如何巩固合作社，进一步发挥它的优越性。
    我们新的社会主义制度下的各种关系是互相合作，互相促进互相发展的关系，与过去剥削与被剥削之间的对立关系根本不同，这种关系是发展生产的最有利的根本条件，但是生产力落后的实际情况，使我们当前发展生产的规模和速度受到一定的限制。如果不看到当前客观实际中存在着这一矛盾的两方面情况，就会发生错误。我们工业化已有初步基础，但经济还很落后，我们既患寡又患不均。因此我认为编制第二个五年计划，应当着重研究国民经济各方面的比例关系。已经暴露了矛盾的固然应该设法平衡，就是已经平衡了的关系还应考虑再平衡。国防工业与民用工业的比例关系，我认为要慎重考虑，国防工业应该建立在强大民用工业的基础上，但重要的国防工业必需有先行的准备。在财政开支上，我们应当贯彻“保证重点，适当压缩”的方针，应当全面履行增产节约，但必要的国防经费和科学研究经费，必须有适当的保证。各方面对于计划执行情况的经常检查、监督，也应该加强，以便及时发现问题，修正错误，使计划能更好地全面完成。
    在文教工作上，现在还存在需要与可能，数量与质量的矛盾，特别是大学学生课程负担过重的现象，还严重存在。课程精减以后，大学生的实际负担仍未减轻，主要原因还在中学的基础不好。因此中、大学教学质量的衔接很值得注意。
    七年来，全国六亿人民都走向了社会主义的大道，这是共产党对全国人民统筹兼顾的一个全面大安排。毛主席指示我们“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义”。我们应该更好的经常的贯彻到实际工作中去。
    当前世界总的趋势是走向和缓的，走向进步的，我们国内总的形势是欣欣向荣的，只要我们坚决依靠中国共产党的领导，加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，加强民族独立运动力量和和平力量的团结，我们将满怀信心地把我国的社会主义建设事业和人类和平进步事业继续向前推进！
