Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, March 23rd: Bulgarian newspapers published on the 22nd a resolution by the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Bulgarian Council of Ministers on the labor organization and remuneration of agricultural production cooperatives, improving the agricultural technical guidance of cooperatives, and strengthening the leadership of backward cooperatives.

The resolution pointed out that agricultural production cooperatives at the present stage have accumulated rich experience in their work, but some of the existing regulations on labor organization and remuneration of agricultural production cooperatives can no longer cover all aspects of the diverse work of the cooperatives, and in many cases, they restrict the cooperatives' initiative in leading production under special working conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to take concrete measures to further improve their work.

The resolution suggested that cooperatives, based on their own experience and the experience of other cooperatives, further consolidate production teams; stipulate that cooperatives have the right to stipulate different labor standards and remuneration for labor days based on their specific production conditions such as soil and mechanization levels; and suggested that cooperatives continuously increase the labor remuneration given to members.

The resolution also stipulated that outstanding agricultural workers and experienced chairmen of consolidated cooperatives, as well as national and party workers, should continue to be sent to work in backward cooperatives.

    保共中央和部长会议发布决议
    进一步改善农业合作社工作
    新华社索非亚23日电保加利亚各报在22日公布了保加利亚共产党中央委员会和保加利亚部长会议关于农业生产合作社的劳动组织和劳动报酬、改进合作社的农业技术指导工作和加强落后的合作社的领导工作的决议。
    决议指出，现阶段的农业生产合作社在工作方面已经有了丰富的经验，而农业生产合作社现有的一些有关劳动组织和报酬的规定已经不能包括合作社多种多样工作的一切方面，并且在许多情况下限制了合作社在特殊工作条件下领导生产的积极性。因此，必须采取一些具体措施进一步改善它们的工作。
    决议中建议合作社根据自己和其他合作社的经验，进一步巩固生产队；规定合作社有权根据自己的土壤和机械化的程度等具体生产条件来规定不同的劳动标准和劳动日的报酬；并且建议合作社不断增加给予社员的劳动报酬。
    决议中还规定要继续把优秀的农业工作人员和巩固了的合作社的有经验的主席以及国家和党的工作人员派到落后的合作社去工作。
