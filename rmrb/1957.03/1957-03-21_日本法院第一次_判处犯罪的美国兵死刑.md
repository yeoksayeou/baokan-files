Xinhua News Agency, March 20th: For the first time, a Japanese court has sentenced a criminal American soldier to death.

The criminal sentenced to death today by the Sendai District Court of Japan is a Private First Class named Boone from the U.S. Army's First Cavalry Division. This American soldier, along with his mistress, Shigeko Sasaki, robbed a Japanese woman named Kikuko Muraki of cash and more than fifty items in Sendai City last September. They also set fire to the victim, burning her to death and destroying her house. His accomplice, Shigeko Sasaki, was also sentenced to death today.

After the war, Japan did not have criminal jurisdiction over American soldiers who committed crimes in Japan. Japan only gained this right after the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Administrative Agreement" in 1953.

    日本法院第一次
　　判处犯罪的美国兵死刑
    据新华社20日讯　日本的法院第一次对犯罪的美国兵判处死刑。
    日本仙台地方裁判所今天判处死刑的罪犯是美军第一骑兵师的一个二等兵，名字叫布恩。这个美国兵曾经同他的情妇佐佐木茂子于去年9月在仙台市抢走了一个名叫村木纪久子的日本妇女的现款和五十多件东西，并且放火烧死了受害者和烧毁了她的房屋。同谋者佐佐木茂子在今天也被判处死刑。
    战后，日本对于在日本犯罪的美国兵没有刑事裁判权。直到1953年修改了日美“行政协定”后日本才有了这种权利。
