    From Tank Soldier to Cooperative Director
    Luo Jia
    Jinzhugou, Pingli County, Shaanxi, is a village in the mountains, home to forty peasant households. The year before last, when the land was frozen, they formed the Jinzhu Agricultural Production Cooperative in the high tide of cooperativization.
    Who should be chosen as the cooperative director? The villagers deliberated for three days, and everyone agreed to elect Li Huanyong. Li Huanyong—this tank soldier who had bravely fought the enemy on the Korean battlefield—now frowned and stood up to say, "Folks, please consider this further! Although I have received several years of Party education, farming matters seem as thick as a bucket to me, but are actually as fine as a cow's hair. I really can't bear such a heavy responsibility." Youth League members Bu Xicai and Chen Quande stood up and shouted, "Huanyong, do it! The organization will support you, and the elders will guide you." The masses also laughed and said, "You're a leader, and we're all in this together whether the cooperative does well or poorly." Seeing that he couldn't refuse, he mustered his courage and said, "Alright!"
    The spring breeze blew into Jinzhugou, and the ice and snow began to melt. It was time to plant, but where would the rations and seeds come from? Li Huanyong said to the villagers, "Production is like fighting a war, you must not be afraid of hardship or difficulty." He mobilized many villagers to voluntarily contribute seeds, and some even asked friends and relatives to borrow from other villages. The seeds were gathered, but the rations were not settled. Li Huanyong immediately convened a meeting of cooperative members to discuss this issue. He proposed the idea of ​​taking out a loan, but most of the members disagreed, saying: Incurring debt is like a hole, even if there is no grain, there are always tree bark and grass roots.
    The meeting decided not to take out a loan. In the end, it was still the district party secretary, Huang Chengbin, who mobilized the cooperative to take out a loan from the bank and bought some rations to get through the spring famine.
    When the wheat was about to be harvested, the labor attendance rate in the cooperative decreased, and some people did not go to the fields until the sun was high. Li Huanyong became anxious and went door-to-door to call them. At the meeting, he said, "Production is like fighting a war, you need a burst of energy, you need to obey orders and obey deployments. Such disorganization is not acceptable." He himself took the lead in working, but there was still no change. After discussing with the cooperative cadres, it was decided to solicit opinions from the cooperative members. Later, some members reflected, "From spring to now, we haven't had a day off, the production is too tense, and people can't stand it." He immediately held a meeting with the cooperative cadres to study solutions, leaving the members with appropriate rest time, reducing unnecessary meetings, and shortening meeting times as much as possible. He also constantly encouraged members to give the cooperative's cadres opinions and improve the cooperative's leadership.
    As the democratic atmosphere in the cooperative rose, so did the enthusiasm for production.
    This agricultural cooperative of forty households has ten "five guarantees" households. Li Huanyong was very concerned about them, taking care of their food, clothing, fuel, and housing. When the old man Wang Zutang died, everything was prepared for the funeral, except for someone to hold the spirit tablet. Li Huanyong said, "I'll do it." Others said, "I'm afraid that's not appropriate." He said, "It's appropriate, isn't the old man old enough to have raised me as a son?" With that, he picked up the spirit tablet and walked in the front of the funeral procession. Li Huanyong giving the spirit tablet to an old, orphaned person seemed to grow wings, and quickly spread throughout the nearby villages and cooperatives. The lonely old people of this cooperative respected and loved this cooperative director from the bottom of their hearts, regarding him as their own son.
    In the year since the cooperative was established, Jinzhugou has begun to change its appearance. Last year, the grain harvest was more than 28,000 jin more than the year before.
    When Li Huanyong talked to me, he took out a letter from his pocket and said to me, "This was written by my comrades-in-arms. It's been several months, and I haven't replied yet. When you come again at the end of the year, I'll ask you to write on my behalf, giving my entire comrades-in-arms a general report after returning from demobilization!"

    从坦克兵到社主任
    骆加
    陕西平利县金竹沟，是山区的一个村庄，住着四十户农民。前年，大地冰封的时候，他们在合作化高潮中，组成了金竹农业生产合作社。
    究竟选谁当社主任好呢？社员一连酝酿了三天，大家都同意选李焕勇。李焕勇——这个曾在朝鲜战场上英勇杀敌的坦克兵，这时反而皱起眉头，站起来说：“乡亲们，大家再考虑考虑吧！我虽然受了几年党的教育，做庄稼的事，看起来粗如水桶，实际上细如牛毛，我实在担不起这么大的重任。”青年团员卜希才、陈全德站起来喊道：“焕勇，干吧！有组织支持你，有长辈们指点你。”群众也笑着说：“你算个头目，社搞好搞坏还有我们众人。”他看推辞不过，鼓着勇气说：“好吧！”
    春风吹进了金竹沟，冰雪开始融化。该种地了，口粮和种子从那里来呢？李焕勇对社员说：“生产跟打仗一样，要不怕苦，不怕难。”他发动许多社员自动地拿出种子，有的还托亲求友向外村去借。种子凑够了，口粮没着落。李焕勇立即召开社员大会，讨论这个问题。他提出贷款的意见，多数社员不同意，他们说：拉下账就是窟窿，虽说粮食没有了，树皮草根总还有的。
    会上决定不贷款。最后，还是区委书记黄承斌动员社里向银行贷款，买了些口粮，度过了春荒。
    快麦收时，社里的劳动出勤率降低了，有的人太阳一竿子高了还不下地。李焕勇急了，上门喊叫。开会时，他说：“生产跟打仗一样，要一股劲，要服从指挥，服从调动，这样散漫无组织可不行。”他自己又带头干，也仍然没有什么改变。经过和社干部商量，决定向社员征求意见。后来，有的社员反映说：“春上到现在，没放过一天假，生产太紧张，人受不住。”他随即同社干部开会研究解决，给社员们留出适当的休息时间，少开些不必要的会，开会时间也尽量短一些。他还随时启发社员给社的干部提意见，改进社的领导。
    社里的民主空气一高涨，生产劲头也就大了。
    这个四十户的农业社，有十个“五保”户。李焕勇非常关心他们，吃的、穿的、烧的、住的，他都操心到了。孤老王祖堂死了，安葬的那天，什么都有了，就差个抱灵牌的人，李焕勇说：“我来。”别人说：“怕使不得。”他说：“使得，老人家这么大年纪，还生养不下我这个儿子吗？”说着就把灵牌抱起来，走在送葬人的最前面。李焕勇给孤老抱灵牌这件事，好像长了翅膀，很快在附近村、社传开了。这个社的孤寡老人，从心里敬爱这个社主任，把他看成自己的亲儿子。
    建社一年来，金竹沟开始改变面貌，去年粮食比前年多收了两万八千多斤。
    李焕勇同我谈话时，从口袋里掏出一封信对我说：“这是战友们写来的，几个月了，我还没回信。年底你再来，我请你代笔，给我的全体战友们，作个复员回来后的总汇报！”
