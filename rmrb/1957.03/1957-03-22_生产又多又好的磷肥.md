　　Produce More and Better Phosphate Fertilizer

    This newspaper reports that the Jinan Joint State-Private Yuxing Chemical Factory is actively producing phosphate fertilizer to support agricultural harvests.

    The phosphate fertilizer successfully trial-produced by the factory last year is most suitable for application to sorghum and cereal crops. This year, the factory plans to produce 40,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer. On the one hand, they are mobilizing employees to actively tap production potential and increase output; on the other hand, they will add two crushers to expand production capacity. After completion by the end of March, the daily output can be increased from the current 130 tons to more than 150 tons.

　  生产又多又好的磷肥
    本报讯　济南公私合营裕兴化工厂积极生产磷肥，支援农业丰收。
    从去年这个厂试制成功的磷肥，最适宜于高粱、谷类作物施用。今年，这个厂计划生产磷肥四万吨。他们一方面发动职工积极挖掘生产潜力，提高产量；另一方面将增建粉碎机两台，扩大生产能力，到3月底竣工后，日产量可由现在的一百三十吨提高到一百五十吨以上。
