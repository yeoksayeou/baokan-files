Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th—The Zhengzhou Railway Administration organizes shippers to exchange mutually counter-flowing transported materials. In the first two months of this year, they helped coal and construction companies in Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu and other provinces to exchange 465 train cars of coal transported in opposing directions. They also helped Henan Provincial Construction Company and Luoyang Engineering Bureau exchange a batch of bricks and tiles. These counter-flow materials were formed due to the counter-flow of local material allocation plans and central material allocation plans, as well as counter-flow of transportation plans between certain units. Currently, a total of 724 train cars of counter-flow materials have been exchanged. This has not only reduced the number of through trains on the western section of the Longhai Railway by 11 pairs, but also saved the state more than 120,000 yuan in freight charges.

Organizing shippers to mutually exchange counter-flow materials has become one of the important methods for the Zhengzhou Railway Administration to promote rational transportation, tap transportation potential, and alleviate the tense railway transportation situation.

　　郑州铁路管理局组织货主交换对流运输物资
    新华社郑州20日电　郑州铁路管理局组织货主互相交换对流运输的物资。在今年头两个月里，他们帮助河南、陕西、甘肃等省煤建公司，交换了四百六十五车相对方向运送的煤，还帮助河南省建筑公司和洛阳工程局交换了一批砖瓦。这些对流物资是由于地方物资调运计划和中央物资调运计划对流以及某些单位之间的运输计划对流等形成的。现在，已经交换的对流物资共有七百二十四车，这样不仅减少陇海铁路西段通过列车十一对，还给国家节省了运费十二万多元。
    组织货主互相交换对流物资，已经成为郑州铁路管理局推行合理运输、挖掘运输潜力、缓和铁路运输紧张局面的重要方法之一。
