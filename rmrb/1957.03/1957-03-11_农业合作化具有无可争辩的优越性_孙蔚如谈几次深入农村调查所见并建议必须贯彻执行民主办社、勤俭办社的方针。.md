I fully endorse Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people at the Supreme State Conference, Premier Zhou's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries, and Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of several issues concerning the suggestions for the Second Five-Year Plan. I also fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of our country have achieved tremendous accomplishments on all fronts in the past year. Whether in cities or the countryside, whether in industrial construction or agricultural production, a new and inspiring atmosphere of vigorous development has emerged everywhere. In our Shaanxi region, industrial construction has developed rapidly, and the great socialist transformation, like in other parts of the country, has been basically completed. Taking the countryside as an example, the number of farm households joining advanced cooperatives has reached 96.27% of the total farm households, which can be said to be a complete realization of advanced agricultural cooperativization. The finally liberated cooperative farmers, with their heroic and unrestrained socialist labor enthusiasm, and as a result of repeated struggles against various natural disasters, have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of grain and cotton throughout the province. From the evolution of various facts, we can clearly see that agricultural cooperativization has extremely great and indisputable superiority, and this is the unshakable, bright, and happy road for the farmers of our country.

In the past year, I have gone deep into the countryside several times to inspect work. Every time I went to a place and a cooperative, and in many contacts and conversations with people, what I saw and heard was all moving and exciting. Not long ago, I returned to my hometown and looked at four advanced cooperatives, one of which was well-run, one was a medium-run cooperative, one was poorly run, and one was a "thousand-catty cooperative." My hometown is located in the suburbs of Xi'an, which can generally represent the suburban areas of the city and other economic crop areas of Guanzhong. Now I will report on the situation of this inspection as follows.

Cooperatives Increase Production, and the Income of Most Members Increases

The four cooperatives I saw this time were all established in the winter of 1955, and 1956 was their first year of collective production. When the cooperatives were first established, on the one hand, people's enthusiasm for taking the road of cooperativization was high, and their labor enthusiasm was very high; but on the other hand, everyone lacked experience in running cooperatives, especially regarding whether production could be increased, they were skeptical. It was in this first year of practice that it was proved: no matter which cooperative, production increased, and the income of the vast majority of members increased. The Huokou Village Agricultural Cooperative in my hometown, which is now a medium-run cooperative, in 1955 before the establishment of the cooperative, the public grain task was not completed until the spring of the following year, nearly half of the unified purchase grain task was not completed, and thirty-eight of the more than one hundred and sixty households in the village lacked grain, and the state supplied more than 11,000 catties of grain. Many people had difficulties in production and life and needed loans. The cloth coupons issued by the state could not be used up, and many people could not even afford new homespun clothes. During the Spring Festival, only two pigs were slaughtered in the whole village, and 80% of the people did not eat meat. In the winter of 1955, the high tide of agricultural cooperativization arrived, and everyone actively and enthusiastically joined the advanced cooperative in one step. Compared with before joining the cooperative, there have been great changes after joining the cooperative. In 1956, grain and cotton achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The total agricultural and sideline income of the cooperative was more than 126,000 yuan, an increase of more than 20,000 yuan compared with the previous year. After deducting the public grain to be handed over, setting aside production investment for the cooperative for the following year, and the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund that should be withdrawn, the absolute value of each labor day was 3.166 yuan, and the average income of each member household was 558.24 yuan, an increase of 128.63 yuan compared with the previous year, with an average of 108.1 yuan per person. The public grain task was completed once after the summer harvest, and the unified purchase grain task was also overfulfilled. Now there is not a single household lacking grain in the whole cooperative, and most of them have surplus grain. More than fifty households in the whole cooperative can eat for one and a half years, and more than twenty households can eat for two years. The vast majority of households that have been in debt for years have already paid them off. Most people in the whole cooperative sewed new clothes during the Spring Festival, and many people added new quilts. Everyone felt that the cloth coupons issued by the government were not enough. We also saw that the number of people building new houses and buying bicycles was increasing. During this year's Spring Festival, the whole cooperative slaughtered eighteen fat pigs, and every family had meat to eat. We also calculated a detailed account of income comparison in the cooperative. Among the 162 member households in the whole cooperative, 155 households had increased their income compared with the previous year, including seventeen landlords, four small land renters, eight upper-middle peasants, thirty-nine lower-middle peasants, and eighty-seven poor peasants. Four households had the same income as the previous year, including two upper-middle peasants and two lower-middle peasants. Only three poor peasants had less income than the previous year. Why did these seven households not increase their income or reduce their income? According to our understanding, some of them were sick for a long time and no one participated in labor; some of them built houses for themselves and participated in less labor in the cooperative; some of them joined the cooperative late and did less labor days. Chairman Mao once instructed us to strive to ensure that more than 90% of the members can increase their income within three or four years. In my opinion, in that medium-run cooperative in my hometown, it has already been done in just one year, which is such a happy thing.

So, what is the situation of the better-run cooperatives? In the Xinxingzhuang Advanced Cooperative in the suburbs of Xi'an, all sixty-six households in the whole cooperative increased their income. Compared with 1955, the income increased by 10-20% for seven households, 21-50% for eight households, 51-100% for twenty-nine households, 101-150% for thirteen households, 151-200% for one household, and more than 200% for eight households. The whole cooperative achieved "one surplus after two harvests" of grain. In 1955, the members borrowed more than 3,000 yuan from banks and credit cooperatives, but now, in addition to paying off all the debts, they have deposited more than 11,000 yuan. After the rich peasant Tian Lianmao joined the cooperative, not only did his income not decrease, but it increased by 83% compared to when he was working alone. Sun Shuisheng, an upper-middle peasant in Huokou Village, increased his income by 97% compared to when he was working alone. These facts make people feel deeply excited.

The Young are Provided For, and the Old are Cared For Until the End

What is especially worth mentioning is that those helpless, old, weak, and widowed people who lack labor, after agricultural cooperativization, have truly found their warm family where the young are provided for and the old are cared for until the end. They receive meticulous care and attention from the cooperative. For example, the Huokou Village Agricultural Cooperative distributed 350 catties of wheat, 50 catties of millet, 50 catties of corn, 3 catties of cotton, 10 catties of green onions, and 25 yuan of pocket money (including 5 yuan for the Spring Festival) to each "five guarantees" household, totaling 66.88 yuan, and they lived a good life. The standard for retaining fine grains for other members is 268 catties. Why give so much to the "five guarantees" households? The cooperative cadres said: Our cooperative is to enable the elderly to spend their old age happily and children to grow up healthily. The Xinxingzhuang Cooperative also assigned light labor that they could handle to the elderly, so that they also had a certain labor income. I think, who would not be satisfied with such a cooperative?

Collective Strength Overcomes All Difficulties

We also investigated why these cooperatives were able to increase production so much in the first year of collective production. This is due to the high enthusiasm of the members for labor and the high degree of exertion of collective strength. What individual farmers could not do or could not do well in the past can now be done. Difficulties that could not be overcome in the past can now be overcome. The Huokou Village Cooperative expanded the replanting area from 520 mu in 1955 to more than 1,100 mu, and widely promoted fine varieties of wheat, cotton, and corn. At the same time, it also dug nineteen new water wells on the land where well drilling had failed in the past, increasing the irrigated area from 35 mu to 188 mu. It also installed electric waterwheels, planted vegetables that had never been planted before, and especially developed the pig raising industry. In the Yangjiazhuang cooperative, they initially bought nineteen pigs, but eighteen died due to the epidemic. However, the members did not lose heart. They bought eighteen more pigs. At the same time, in order to have great development, they humbly learned feeding and management methods from nearby cooperatives with experience in pig raising. As a result, within half a year, they achieved an average of four pigs per household. Here, we can clearly see that the cooperative farmers used their collective wisdom and strength to overcome all difficulties and achieved a bumper harvest, and eloquently explained that agricultural production cooperatives are the source of farmers' happy life.

In such cooperatives, if some people were still hesitant last year and wanted to turn back, then now those who had the idea of withdrawing from the cooperative no longer withdraw, those who were worried about reducing income have stabilized their emotions, and the idea of treating the cooperative as their own family is growing day by day. As some people said: I really turned over when I joined the advanced cooperative. In these cooperatives we have visited, whether they are cooperative cadres or members, they are all working hard with full confidence to achieve a greater harvest in 1957. The Huokou Village Cooperative wants to strive to increase the absolute value of each labor day from 3.166 yuan to four yuan this year. The Xinxingzhuang Cooperative strives to be a thousand-catty cooperative. The Yangjiazhuang Cooperative guarantees to continue to maintain the honor of the thousand-catty cooperative and strives to continue to improve one step further, learning from the famous Fenghuo Cooperative in Liquan County, led by the young socialist activist Wang Baojing.

Some Hopes and Suggestions

Finally, what I want to mention is that these cooperatives still have some shortcomings and problems, which may also exist in other places, and it is worth paying attention to and solving. I personally plan to put forward a few hopes and suggestions here. If they are beneficial, please consider adopting them.

(1) We must run cooperatives democratically. "Cadres decide everything." The strength and quality of cooperative cadres are a very important factor in running a cooperative well. According to my conversations with some members, they all have some opinions, more or less, large or small, on the current cooperative cadres, mainly regarding the democratic style of the cooperative cadres. At the symposium, some cooperative cadres conducted self-criticism for their lack of a strong sense of responsibility in some areas, or for the phenomenon of disunity, which caused some losses in production. In the democratic cooperative management discussion, the Dongqu Cooperative also adjusted individual unqualified cooperative cadres and strengthened leadership, which proves that the CPC Central Committee's policy of democratic cooperative management is very correct. To run a cooperative well, cooperative cadres must have a democratic style, consult with members on everything, and humbly listen to opinions from all sides. As long as it is conducive to production, even the opinions of rich peasants and landlords should be considered and adopted, so as to gather ideas and benefit everyone. For example, in the democratic cooperative management discussion in the winter of last year, the members of the Xinxingzhuang Agricultural Cooperative put forward fifty-two rationalization suggestions to the cooperative management committee. Zhang Zhicheng, the director of the cooperative, said: "This has greatly solved the problem for us in improving production and improving our work." When dealing with internal problems of the cooperative, it must be fair and reasonable, and the entire cooperative should be managed as if it were one's own family. However, on the other hand, it also requires the efforts of the members to educate the members to establish the idea of cherishing collective interests, unite as one, care for and help the cadres, and work together to run the cooperative well.

(2) We must run cooperatives thriftily. The development of production and the improvement of living standards are gratifying phenomena. However, the phenomenon of waste has grown somewhat among some members with higher incomes. Like the Xinxingzhuang Agricultural Cooperative (a first-class cooperative), with a total of sixty-six households, nine pigs were slaughtered during the Spring Festival this year, and ten bicycles were purchased in less than a month from the Spring Festival until now. When the cooperative is just being established and the personal and collective assets are not very wealthy, cooperative cadres and members should adhere to the policy of "running cooperatives thriftily" and carry forward the fine tradition of "managing the family thriftily" of our nation. Members with higher incomes should deposit the part of the money they cannot spend in the bank, and it is best to invest it in production, because only by continuously expanding reproduction can there be more income, which will undoubtedly be of great benefit to both the cooperative and themselves.

(3) Pay attention to protecting and breeding livestock. In Huokou Village, we looked at their livestock. The existing livestock there is weak and scarce, which shows that the only driving force in agricultural production today—livestock—is very weak. The director of the cooperative said that because the amount of work increased last year, all 107 livestock in the cooperative were basically thin. At the same time, the breeding of livestock is very small. For example, in the cooperative last year, only three of the thirteen cows were bred. This is a very serious problem and should be paid attention to, and concrete and effective measures should be taken, such as educating members to cherish livestock, stipulating different quotas according to the physical condition of livestock, appropriately increasing the work points of breeders, strengthening epidemic prevention inspections, and establishing necessary reward systems. In particular, we must seize the breeding period this spring to ensure that not only are the large livestock fat and strong, but also that the young livestock are rapidly expanded and grown.

(4) We must attach importance to summarizing experience and learning from advanced cooperatives. The Yangjiazhuang "thousand-catty cooperative" had an average yield of 1,035 catties and thirteen taels per mu of grain in 1956, but it did not summarize its experience well, which is not conducive to promoting advantages, improving oneself, exchanging experience, and promoting others. It is suggested that party and government leaders and relevant parties should attach importance to helping each cooperative summarize experiences and lessons in a timely manner and organize learning from advanced cooperatives so as to continuously improve and progress on the existing basis.

(5) We must mobilize all positive factors, exert all useful forces, and do a good job in production. The Xinxingzhuang Agricultural Cooperative assigned some light work that she could handle to an old woman from a "five guarantees" household. She and a child earned a total of 180 yuan in 1956. This not only increased the labor force in the cooperative, but also increased her own income. This win-win approach is worth emulating by other cooperatives.

These agricultural cooperatives, like most agricultural cooperatives in the country, have only been established for only one year, or a little over a year. It is impossible to ask them to be perfect. They will all have some shortcomings and errors, more or less, and they will also encounter some difficulties, but these are temporary difficulties, difficulties in the course of progress. Now they have all seen and recognized that these difficulties can be overcome and are actively overcoming them. We believe that under the correct leadership of the Party, on the basis of the continuous improvement of the enthusiasm and creativity of all farmers, and with the gradual enrichment of the experience of the vast number of cadres through practical training, the agricultural cooperatives will surely be run better day by day. We firmly believe that the 500 million farmers in our country will surely be able to move towards a more happy and fulfilling future along this bright and flat road of cooperativization.

### 农业合作化具有无可争辩的优越性  孙蔚如谈几次深入农村调查所见并建议必须贯彻执行民主办社、勤俭办社的方针。

    农业合作化具有无可争辩的优越性
    孙蔚如谈几次深入农村调查所见并建议必须贯彻执行民主办社、勤俭办社的方针。
    我完全拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾问题的报告、周总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告，和李富春副总理关于第二个五年计划建议的若干问题的说明，完全同意陈叔通副主席关于中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告。
    在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，我国人民在过去的一年中，在各个战线上都取得了巨大的成就。不论是城市和农村，不论是工业建设和农业生产，到处都出现了振奋人心的蓬勃发展的新气象。我们陕西地区，工业建设发展很快，伟大的社会主义改造事业，也和全国各地一样，已经基本完成。就拿农村来说，加入高级合作社的农户，已经占到总农户的96.27％，可以说完全实现了高级农业合作化。最后解放了的合作农民以他们豪迈奔放的社会主义的劳动热情，和各种自然灾害反复斗争的结果，使全省粮食和棉花的生产，取得空前未有的大丰收。我们从种种事实的演变中可以清楚的看到，农业合作化具有极其巨大的无可争辩的优越性，这是我国农民不可动摇的光明幸福的大道。
    一年来我曾经几次深入农村视察工作。每到一地一社，和许多人的接触交谈中，所见所闻无不令人感动和兴奋。不久前我回到我的家乡，看了四个高级社，其中一个社办得较好，一个中等社，一个社办得较差，还有一个是千斤社。我的家乡位于西安郊区，大体可以代表城市郊区和关中其他经济作物区的社。现在我就把这次视察的情况，作如下汇报。
    社社增产，大多数社员收入增加
    这次我下乡看的四个社，都是1955年冬季建立起来的，1956年是他们集体生产的第一年。社初建立时，一方面人们的走合作化道路的热情正在高涨，劳动的积极性是很高的；但是另一方面大家对于办社缺少经验，特别是对能否增产半信半疑。就在这第一年的实践中证明：不管那个社都增产了，绝大多数的社员都增加了收入。我的家乡豁口村农业社，现在是个中等社，在未建社前的1955年，公粮任务到第二年春季才陆续完成，统购粮任务将近一半没有完成，全村一百六十多户人家，有三十八户缺粮，由国家供应粮食一万一千余斤，有不少人生产、生活困难，需要借贷，国家颁发的布证用不完，不少的人连新土布衣都穿不上，过春节时全村只杀了两口猪，有80％的人没有吃肉。1955年冬季农业合作化的高潮到来了，大伙儿积极热情的一步登天加入了高级社。入社后和入社前比较有了很大的变化。1956年粮食和棉花取得空前丰收，全社农、副业总收入十二万六千多元，比上年增加二万余元。除去应交的公粮，预留下一年社里的生产投资，和应该抽出的公积金、公益金以外，每个劳动日的绝对值是3.166元，每户社员平均收入558.24元，比上年增加了128.63元，每人平均108.1元。夏收后一次就完成了公粮任务，统购粮任务也超额完成了。现在全社没有一个缺粮户，而且大部分有了余粮，全社有五十多户可吃一年半，二十多户可吃二年。连年欠债的户，绝大部分已经归还。全社大部分人过年时缝了新衣服，许多人添了新被子，大家感到政府发的布证不够用了。我们还看到盖新房子、买自行车的人不断增加。今年过春节时，全社杀了十八口肥猪，家家都有肉吃。我们在该社还算了一下收入对比的细账，全社一百六十二户社员中有一百五十五户比上年收入有所增加，其中包括十七户地主，四户小土地出租者，八户上中农，三十九户下中农，和八十七户贫农。有四户和上年的收入相等，其中两户是上中农，两户是下中农。只有三户贫农比上年的收入少了。这七户人家为什么没有增加收入或者减少了收入呢？据我们了解，有的是长期生病无人参加劳动；有的是给自己盖房子，在社内参加劳动少；有的是入社时间迟，少作了一些劳动日。毛主席曾经指示我们，要争取在三、四年内做到90％以上的社员都能增加收入，据我看，就在我的家乡的那个中等社里，只有一年就已经办到了，这是一桩何等令人高兴的事情。
    那么，办得较好的社的情况怎样呢？西安市郊区的新兴庄高级社，全社六十六户全部增加了收入。1956年和1955年比较，收入增加10—20％的七户，21—50％的八户，51—100％的二十九户，101—150％的十三户，151—200％的一户，200％以上的八户。全社粮食作到“耕二余一”。1955年社员借贷银行和信用社的钱三千多元，现在除全部还清以外还存入一万一千多元。富农田连茂入社后不但没有减少收入，而且比他单干时增加了83％。豁口村有户上中农孙水生，比单干时的收入增加了97％。这些事实使人深深地感到兴奋。
    幼有所养，老有所终
    尤其值得提到的是那些无依无靠、缺乏劳动力的老弱孤寡，在农业合作化后，真正找到了他们幼有所养、老有所终的温暖的家庭。他们受到合作社无微不至的关怀和照顾。例如豁口村农业社，分给“五保”户每人小麦三百五十斤，小米五十斤，包谷五十斤，棉花三斤，大葱十斤，零用钱二十五元（包括过春节五元），共折合66.88元，生活过得很好。给其他社员留细粮的标准是二百六十八斤，为什么给“五保”户那样多呢？社干部说：我们社里是为了使老年人愉快地度过晚年，幼儿能够健康地成长。新兴庄社还给老年人分配了他们力能胜任的轻便的劳动，使他们也有一定的劳动收入。我想，这样的合作社，有谁还不满意呢？
    集体力量战胜了一切困难
    我们还考察了这些合作社为什么在集体生产的头一年，就能够增产很多。这是由于社员们劳动积极性的高涨和集体力量的高度发挥所致。过去单干农民不能办或者办不好的，现在都能办到了。过去克服不了的困难，现在能够克服了。豁口村合作社复种面积由1955年的五百二十亩扩大为一千一百多亩，大面积的推广了小麦、棉花和包谷等优良品种。同时，还在过去打井失败的土地上，新打了十九口水井，使水地灌溉面积由过去的三十五亩增加到一百八十八亩，还安装了电力水车，种植了从来没有种过的蔬菜，特别是养猪事业有了大发展。在杨家庄那个社里，开始买了十九口猪，因为疫疾流行死了十八口，但是社员们并未灰心，他们又买了十八口，同时为了有大的发展，虚心地向附近对养猪有经验的社学习饲养管理方法，结果在半年内达到每户平均养猪四口。这里，我们很清楚地看到，合作农民用他们的集体智慧和力量，战胜了一切困难，取得了丰收，又雄辩似地向人们说明农业生产合作社是农民生活幸福的泉源。
    在这样的社里，如果说去年还有人摇摆不定，想走回头路，那么，现在有过退社想法的人不退了，顾虑收入要减少的人情绪安定了，而把社当成自己家庭的思想却在日益生长。正如有的人说：我入了高级社，才真正的翻身了。在我们去过的这些社里，不论是社干部和社员，都是满怀信心地正在为取得1957年的更大丰收而努力。豁口村合作社要争取今年每个劳动日的绝对值由3.166元提高到四元。新兴庄社争取做一个千斤社，杨家庄社保证继续保持千斤社的荣誉，并争取继续提高一步，向全省著名的由青年社会主义积极分子王保京领导的醴泉县烽火社学习。
    几点希望和建议
    最后，我要提到的是这些社还存在一些缺点和问题，可能其他地方也有，值得注意和解决。我个人打算在这里提出几点希望和建议，如果是有益的，请斟酌采纳。
    （一）必须民主办社。“干部决定一切”，社干部强弱好坏，对于办好合作社是一个很重要的因素，据我和一些社员的交谈，他们或多或少、或大或小对现在的社干部都有一些意见，主要是社干的民主作风问题，在座谈会上，一些社干部对
  自己某些地方责任心不强，或者有不团结的现象，在生产上造成了一些损失等，进行了自我检讨。东渠社在民主办社大讨论中，还对个别不称职的社干部进行了调整，加强了领导，这就证明了中共中央提出的民主办社的方针是很正确的。要办好社，社干部必须有民主作风，遇事和社员商量，虚心听取各方面的意见，只要有利于生产，就是富农地主的意见也应当考虑采纳，这样才能集思广益。如新兴庄农业社在去年冬季的民主办社大讨论中，社员对社管会提出五十二条合理化建议，社主任张志诚说：“这对我们搞好生产，改进工作，解决了很大问题”。在处理社内问题时，必须公平合理，把整个社当自己家事一样地来办。可是，在另一方面，也要社员的努力，要教育社员树立爱护集体利益的思想，团结一致，关心帮助社干，同心协力地把社办好。
    （二）必须勤俭办社。生产发展，生活改善，这是可喜的现象。但是有些收入较多的社员，浪费现象有所滋长。像新兴庄农业社（一类社）共六十六户，今年春节时，杀了九条猪，春节到现在不到一月时间，就购进自行车十辆。在合作社初办、个人与集体的家底都还不很富裕的时候，社干部和社员都应当坚持“勤俭办社”的方针，和发扬我们民族的“勤俭持家”的优良传统。收入较多的社员，应该把自己用不完的那一部分钱储蓄到银行里去，最好是投到生产上去，因为只有不断的扩大再生产，才能有较多的收入，无疑这对社对自己都有莫大的好处。
    （三）注意保护和繁殖牲畜。在豁口村，我们看了他们的牲畜，那里现有的牲畜是又弱又少，这说明在今天农业生产上唯一的动力——牲畜是很薄弱的。社主任说，去年因活路增多，全社一百零七个牲畜基本上都瘦了。同时牲畜的繁殖很少，像该社去年十三个母牛，只有三个配了种，这是一个非常严重的问题，应当引起注意，并采取具体有力措施，如教育社员爱护牲畜，按牲畜的体力情况规定不同的定额，适当提高饲养员的工分，加强防疫检查，建立必要的奖励制度等。特别是今春要抓紧春情期的繁殖，达到不仅使大牲畜又肥又壮，而且使幼畜迅速的扩大成长起来。
    （四）必须重视总结经验，向先进社学习。杨家庄那个千斤社，1956年粮食平均亩产一千零三十五斤十三两，但没有很好的总结出经验，这对于发扬优点、提高自己、交流经验、推动其他，都是不利的。建议党政领导和有关方面，应重视帮助每一个社及时总结经验和教训，并组织向先进社学习，以便在原有的基础上不断的提高和进步。
    （五）必须调动一切积极因素，发挥一切有用的力量，搞好生产。新兴庄农业社对一个“五保”户的老太婆分配了适合于她所胜任的一些轻活，她和一个小孩子，1956年共收入一百八十元，这样不仅给社里增加了劳动力，而且给她本身增加了收入。这种一举两得的做法，是值得其他社仿效的。
    这些农业合作社和全国大部分农业社一样，办起来才只有一年，或者一年多一点的时间，要求它们都办得十全十美是不可能的。它们都或多或少地会存在一些缺点和错误，也会遇到一些困难，但这是暂时的困难，前进中的困难，现在他们都看到了认清了这些困难是可以克服的，也正在积极克服中。我们相信，在党的正确领导下，在全体农民积极性和创造性不断提高的基础上，在广大干部经过实践锻炼、经验逐渐丰富的情况下，农业社一定会一天比一天办好起来的。我们坚信，我国五亿农民沿着这条光明平坦的合作化的道路，一定能够奔向更加幸福美满的未来。（附图片）
