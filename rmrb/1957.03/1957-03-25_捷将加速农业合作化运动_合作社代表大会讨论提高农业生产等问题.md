Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 24th. The Third Congress of Czechoslovak Unified Agricultural Cooperatives began in Prague on the 22nd. The three-day meeting will discuss the main tasks of Czechoslovak agriculture in the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960), particularly issues related to increasing agricultural production, further developing the cooperativization movement, and strengthening unified agricultural cooperatives economically, organizationally, and politically.

Representatives from eleven countries, including the Soviet Union and China, attended the congress.

Czechoslovak Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Bakula, pointed out in his speech at the opening session that Czechoslovakia's agricultural production increased by 3.4% in 1956, exceeding the pre-war average annual output from 1934 to 1938 by approximately 6%. In the past year, the income of agricultural cooperative members increased by 9.5%. Over the past three years, the degree of mechanization in socialist agriculture has increased from 88% to 92%. The number of tractors used by agricultural cooperatives has increased by 41%.

In the past two years, the number of unified agricultural cooperatives has increased by almost a quarter. By the beginning of 1957, a total of eight thousand one hundred and seventy-two agricultural cooperatives had been established in 57% of the villages, which, together with state farms, accounted for 48% of the country's cultivated land. Last year, the average yield of wheat per hectare in cooperatives was 2.3 metric tons, 15.6% higher than that of individual farmers.

Bakula said that by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, agricultural production would increase by 30% compared to 1955. He emphasized that the agricultural cooperativization movement must be developed more rapidly; only when the socialist component in agriculture gains absolute dominance in the Five-Year Plan can the increase in agricultural production be guaranteed. In addition, it is necessary to further improve the application of new discoveries in agricultural science, improve the work of correctly guiding production according to local conditions, and give the greatest attention to expanding cultivated land area and the production of traditional crops.

Bakula said that due to the correct implementation of the Party's policy of restricting rich peasants, the balance of class forces in the countryside has changed. The new model charter of unified agricultural cooperatives stipulates that if the work and attitude towards the people's democratic system of rich peasant elements prove that they are striving to become honest members of society, then, in individual cases, these elements may be accepted as members of unified agricultural cooperatives. This by no means implies class reconciliation. We will continue to implement a policy of restriction against the rich peasants as a class.

First Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Novotny, addressed the congress on the 23rd. After pointing out the task of increasing agricultural production, he said that those who believe that unified agricultural cooperatives will stop developing and dissolve are very wrong. Those who believe that the development of the cooperativization movement does not need to be organized are also wrong.

Novotny said that how long it will take for socialism to be built in our country depends on the growth of agricultural production and the progress of establishing cooperatives.

### 捷将加速农业合作化运动　合作社代表大会讨论提高农业生产等问题

　　捷将加速农业合作化运动
　　合作社代表大会讨论提高农业生产等问题
    新华社布拉格24日电　捷克斯洛伐克统一农业合作社第三次代表大会22日开始在布拉格举行。这次为期三天的会议将讨论捷克斯洛伐克农业在第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）当中的主要任务，特别是有关提高农业生产、进一步发展合作化运动以及在经济上、组织上、政治上加强统一农业合作社的问题。
    苏联、中国等十一个国家的代表参加了这次大会。
    捷克斯洛伐克农林部长巴库拉在开幕会议上的讲话中指出，1956年捷克斯洛伐克的农业生产增加了3.4％，超过了战前1934到1938年的平均年产量大约6％。过去一年，农业合作社社员的收入增加了9.5％。过去三年来，社会主义农业的耕作机械化程度已经从88％提高到92％。农业合作社使用的拖拉机增加了41％。
    过去两年，统一农业合作社的数目几乎增加了四分之一。到1957年年初，在57％的乡村里一共建立了八千一百七十二个农业合作社，它们连同国营农场在内共占全国耕地面积48％。去年合作社小麦的平均单位面积产量是每公顷二十三公担，比个体农户高出15.6％。
    巴库拉说，到第二个五年计划结束的时候，农业生产将比1955年增加30％。他强调指出，必须更迅速地发展农业合作化运动；只有农业中的社会主义成分在五年计划中取得绝对优势，才能保证农业生产的增加。此外，还必须进一步改善应用农业科学方面的新发现的工作，改善按照地方的具体条件正确指导生产的工作，并且必须对扩大耕地面积和传统农作物的生产给予最大的注意。
    巴库拉说，由于正确执行党的限制富农的政策，农村阶级力量的对比已经发生了变化。新的统一农业合作社示范章程规定，如果富农分子的工作和对人民民主制度的态度证明他们是在努力使自己成为诚实的社会成员的话，那么，在个别情况下，这些分子将有可能被接受为统一农业合作社的社员。这绝不意味着阶级调和。对于富农作为一个阶级，我们将继续执行限制的政策。
    捷共中央第一书记诺沃提尼在23日向大会讲了话。他在指出增加农业生产的任务以后说，那些认为统一农业合作社会停止发展和解散的人是非常错误的。那些认为合作化运动的发展不需要加以组织的人也是错误的。
    诺沃提尼说，社会主义将要多久才会在我国建设完成，这要看农业生产的增长和建立合作社的进展情况而定。
