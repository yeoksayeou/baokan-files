    Proverbs
   Even men stumble, and horses miss a step.
   The master leads you to the door, but the practice is up to you.
   The crow calls the pig black, not realizing it is the same.
   Be wary of words spoken in haste, and cherish times when you have money.
   One rat dropping ruins a whole pot of rice.
   The best runner can't outrun his shadow, and the best talker can't surpass reason.
   Too much water in tofu makes it bland, and too many empty words go unheard.

    谚语
   人有失脚，马有漏蹄。
   师傅领进门，修行在各人。
   老鸦说猪黑，自己不觉得。
   提防急中语，爱惜有钱时。
   一颗耗子屎，打坏一锅饭。
   会走走不过影子，会说说不过道理。
   豆腐多了一包水，空话多了无人听。
