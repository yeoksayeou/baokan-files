Mr. "Shang" Returns Home
　　Xiao Qian

Mr. "Shang" is a renowned language artist. He is not only fluent and uses ready-made phrases, but he also speaks in a consistently balanced and comprehensive manner. It is said that his language has two characteristics: one is generality—but it doesn't sound very specific and sometimes it is inevitably a bit empty and verbose; the other is democracy—he usually doesn't ask about the audience or the occasion when he speaks. Regarding studying Marxism-Leninism, he believes he has a unique approach, advocating that the first thing to master is the language of Marxism-Leninism. As for the difference between the language of Marxism-Leninism and the language of everyday life, and whether what he speaks is actually the language of Marxism-Leninism, he hasn't considered this question. In short, he constantly uses "in principle" and "basically." These words, which originally had substance, have become his catchphrases. No matter what he encounters, he always "shang" it. So, the wags gave him a nickname, calling him Mr. "Shang."

It was dusk, and Mr. "Shang" was not yet home. His wife was taking care of their younger daughter while cooking dinner. Suddenly, there was a sound of footsteps outside the door. As quick as a flash, Mr. "Shang" pushed open the door and walked in. His wife was very happy to see him and hurried to greet him.

The story has been narrated to this point; now, let's move on to the dialogue.

Wife: Why are you so late coming home today?

Shang: Subjectively, I hoped to return earlier, but due to objectively unpredictable and uncontrollable reasons, the time I actually returned was different from the normal time.

Wife (pouting): Just tell me, was the meeting late, or did you miss the bus?

Shang: Qualitatively speaking, the service level of our No. 10 bus is not low, but quantitatively, it is far from keeping up with the needs of today's reality.

Wife (impatiently): The eldest daughter isn't back yet, and the little one keeps crying that she's hungry. Second daughter, bring the little one over to eat!

(The little girl, just over three years old, holding a newly bought doll, waddled over.)

Niu: Daddy, do you think my doll is pretty?

Shang: From the perspective of its appearance, it has certain merits. However, um, (he tugged at the doll's arm) but its movements are still a bit mechanical.

Niu (acting spoiled): Daddy, are we going to the park this Sunday?

Shang: In principle, Daddy agrees to take you, because the park is a place for public entertainment. However—but recently the climate has changed a lot and lacks stability. When the natural conditions improve, Daddy will definitely fulfill your wish.

Wife (setting out the food and chopsticks): Eat, stop philosophizing!

Niu (pushing away her rice bowl): Daddy, I want to eat candy.

Shang: Your love for candy is completely understandable. If this kind of non-staple food doesn't exceed the quota, it can also have a good effect on the second generation. However, didn't Mom give you two fruit candies this morning?

Wife: Let me translate. Little one, your dad is saying that you should eat your rice obediently first. Eating too much candy will give you cavities! (Gently to "Shang") Today the cooperative got a batch of Korean kelp. I weighed out half a catty and used it to make soup to try it out. See if it suits your taste?

Shang (scooping a spoonful and drinking it): Well, one cannot deny that it has a certain flavor.

Wife (blankly): What? Does it suit your taste or not?

Shang (forced to be somewhat embarrassed): From the perspective of taste—if my sense of taste still has a certain accuracy—the next time we make this soup, then I would lean towards adding a little more liquid.

Wife (guessing): Oh, you mean it's too salty, right? I'll make it less salty next time.

(While they were eating, a fifteen- or sixteen-year-old girl walked in. This was the "eldest daughter." Her name was Ming, and she was in the third year of junior high.)

Ming: Dad, (as she spoke, she took out a printed watercolor painting from her schoolbag, saying proudly) a classmate gave this to me. I heard it was painted by a young female artist. Do you think this painting is good?

Shang (taking the painting, tilting his head and looking at it): This is a painting with beautiful scenes. In my opinion (he hesitated), it has a certain appeal. This, of course, is inseparable from the painter's artistic cultivation. However, in terms of the way it is expressed, it cannot be said that it is completely without flaws.

Ming: Dad, what about it attracts you?

Shang: In principle, since it is a painting, and it is published by the state art publishing house, then it cannot but have a certain appeal.

Ming (unconvinced): That won't do. You have to say what it is! (Then, her eyes rolled) Let's do this: You tell me what its flaws are first.

Shang: Whether it has flaws is naturally debatable. However, since it was painted by a young artist, then, in principle, young people always have their vibrant side, and they inevitably have their immature side. This is called the regularity of things.

Ming: Dad, if you asked me why I like it, I wouldn't be so hesitant. I would just tell you: I like the flock of ducks floating beside the reeds. Look, the old duck is in the lead, followed by (counting) one, two, three, four... seven ducklings. I seem to see the glimmer of the feathers on their backs and hear the sound of their little wings flapping in the water.

Shang: Child, how can you grasp a specific part when commenting on a complete work of art? And the word "like" is too colored by personal taste.

Ming: (Interrupting angrily before "Shang" finished speaking): I like it, I like it. Like is like. Anyway, I told you what I like about it. What about you? You "shang" for a long time, (pouting, as if she'd been tricked) but you didn't tell me anything!

Wife: Eldest daughter, don't waste your breath with your dad. When has he ever told anyone anything!

　　“上”人回家
　　萧乾
    “上”人先生是鼎鼎有名的语言艺术家。他说话不但熟练，词儿现成，而且一向四平八稳，面面俱到。据说他的语言有两个特点，其一是概括性——可就是听起来不怎么具体，有时候还难免有些空洞啰嗦；其二是民主性——他讲话素来不大问对象和场合。对于学习马克思列宁主义，他自认有一套独到的办法，他主张首先要掌握的是马克思列宁主义语言。至于马克思列宁主义语言究竟与生活里的语言有什么区别，以及他讲的是不是就是马克思列宁主义语言，这个问题他倒还没考虑过。总之，他满口离不开“原则上”“基本上”，这些本来很有内容的字眼儿，到他嘴里就成了口头禅，无论碰到什么，他都“上”它一下。于是，好事之徒就赠了他一个绰号，称他作“上”人先生。
    这时天交傍晚，“上”人先生还不见回家，他的妻子一边照顾小女儿，一边烧着晚饭。忽听门外一阵脚步声，说时迟，那时快，“上”人推门走了进来。作妻子的看了好不欢喜，赶忙迎上前去。
    故事叙到这里，下面转入对话。
    妻：今儿个你怎么这样晚才回来？
    上：主观上我是希望早些回来的，但是由于客观上难以逆料、无法控制的原因，以致我实际上回来的时间跟正常的时间发生了距离。
    妻（撇了撇嘴）：你干脆说吧，是会散晚啦，还是没挤上汽车？
    上：从质量上说，咱们这十路公共汽车的服务水平不能算低，可惜在数量上，它还远远跟不上今天现实的需要。
    妻（不耐烦）：大丫头还没回来，小妞子直嚷饿得慌。二丫头，拉小妞子过来吃饭吧！
      （小妞子刚满三周岁，怀里抱着个新买的布娃娃，一扭一扭地走了过来。）
    妞：爸爸，你瞧我这娃娃好看不？
    上：从外形上说，它有一定的可取的地方。不过，嗯，（他扯了扯娃娃的胳膊）不过它的动作还嫌机械了一些。
    妞（撒娇地）：爸爸，咱们这个星期天去不去公园呀？
    上：原则上，爸爸是同意带你去的，因为公园是个公共文娱活动的地方。不过——不过近来气候变化很大，缺乏稳定性，等自然条件好转了，爸爸一定满足你这个愿望。
    妻（摆好了饭菜和筷子）：吃吧，别转文啦！
    妞（推开饭碗）：爸爸，我要吃糖。
    上：你热爱糖果，这是完全可以理解的。这种副食品要是不超过定量，对第二代也可以起良好的作用。不过，今天早晨妈妈不是分配两块水果糖给你了吗？
    妻：我来当翻译吧。小妞子，你爸爸是说，叫你先乖乖儿地吃饭，糖吃多了长虫牙！（温柔地对“上”）今儿个合作社到了一批朝鲜的裙带菜，我称了半斤，用它烧汤试一试，你尝尝合不合口味？
    上（舀了一条羹，喝下去）：嗯，不能不说是还有一定的滋味。
    妻（茫然地）：什么？倒是合不合口味呀？
    上（被逼得实在有些发窘）：从味觉上说——如果我的味觉还有一定的准确性的话——下次如果再烧这个汤的话，那么我倾向于再多放一点儿液体。
    妻（猜着）噢，你是说太咸啦，对不对？下回我烧淡一点儿就是嘞。
      （正吃着饭，一个十五、六岁的姑娘推门走进来，这就是“大丫头”。她叫明，今年初中三。）
    明：爸爸，（随说随由书包里拿出一幅印的水彩画，得意地说）这是同学送我的，听说是个青年女画家画的。你看这张画好不好？
    上（接过画来，歪着头望了望）：这是一幅有着优美画面的画。在我看来（沉吟了一下），它具有一定的吸引力。这一点，自然跟画家在艺术上的修养是分不开的。然而在表现方式上，还不能说它完全没有缺点。
    明：爸爸，它哪一点吸引了你？
    上：从原则上说，既然是一幅画，它又是国家的美术出版社出版的，那么，它就不能不具有一定的吸引力。
    明（不服气）：那不成，你得说是什么啊！（然后，眼珠子一转）这么办吧：你先说说它有什么缺点。
    上：它有没有缺点，这一点自然是可以商榷的。不过，既然是青年画家画的，那么，从原则上说，青年总有他生气勃勃的一面，也必然有他不成熟的一面。这就叫作事物的规律性。
    明：爸爸，要是你问我为什么喜欢它呀，我才不会那么吞吞吐吐呢，我就干脆告诉你：我喜欢芦苇旁边浮着的那群鸭子。瞧，老鸭子打头，后边跟着（数）一、二、三、四……七只小鸭子。我好像看见它们背上羽毛的闪光，听到它们的小翅膀拍水的声音。
    上：孩子，评论一件完整的艺术品，你怎么能抓住一个具体的部分？而且“喜欢”这个字眼儿太带有个人趣味的色彩了。
    明：（不等“上”说完就气愤愤地插嘴）：我喜欢，我喜欢。喜欢就是喜欢。说什么，我总归还告诉了你我喜欢它什么，你呢？你“上”了半天，（鼓着嘴巴，像是上了当似的）可是你什么也没告诉我！
    妻：大丫头，别跟你爸爸废嘴啦。他几时曾经告诉过谁什么！
