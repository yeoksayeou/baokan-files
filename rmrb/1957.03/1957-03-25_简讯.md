　  Expanding Xinghua Village Fenjiu Distillery
    The state-owned Xinghua Village Fenjiu Distillery in Shanxi Province will begin expansion this year. The expansion project is expected to be completed in 1958.
    By 1959, the annual production of Fenjiu, which has a history of more than 1,400 years and is famous throughout the world, will be two and a half times its current annual output.
    Washable and Sun-Resistant Dyes
    The two new products successfully trial-produced last year by the state-owned Qingdao Dye Factory—Sulfurized Fast Blue and Sulfurized Dark Blue—have begun production.
    These two new products were trial-produced and put into production using domestic raw materials, according to Soviet formulas and technical designs. Cloth dyed with Sulfurized Fast Blue has a durable color and does not fade even when exposed to the sun frequently. Cloth dyed with Sulfurized Dark Blue has a deep color and is more sun-resistant and washable than ordinary Sulfurized Blue.
  　A New Contraceptive Cream
    The Shanghai Pharmaceutical Company's Kaimeike Pharmaceutical Factory has successfully trial-produced a new contraceptive drug—Jianlemi Contraceptive Cream, which is very popular among the masses.
    This contraceptive drug is like vanishing cream, with each tube containing fifty grams. It can be used with cervical caps and condoms, or it can be used alone.
    The Central Ministry of Health has approved further expansion of production of this contraceptive drug.
  　Fresh Eggs Can Be Stored for Ten Months
    The Jiangsu Provincial Food Company has decided to promote the "sodium silicate" method of egg storage in twenty-one counties and cities, including Xuzhou and Wuxi, during the peak season for fresh eggs this year, storing 2.85 million jin of eggs to meet market consumption needs during the off-season.
    The sodium silicate egg storage method is an advanced Soviet experience and has been successfully practiced by the Heilongjiang Food Company. Using this method, eggs can generally be stored for eight to ten months without deteriorating.
