　  Randomly Recruiting Farmers Affects Spring Plowing
    Recently, the Blackwater, Western Sichuan, and Daofu sub-bureaus affiliated with the Sichuan Forestry Industry Bureau have been severely and randomly recruiting farmers in areas such as Shehong, Lezhi, Santai, Jianyang, Ziyang, and Zhongjiang in Sichuan. In Taolai Township, Lezhi County, more than 100 people have already been recruited from just one township. In Pingwo Township, Jianyang County, more than 300 people have been recruited. On February 8th and 9th, a technician from the Daofu Forestry Industry Bureau named Xie Mingsan, without any credentials, privately recruited workers from agricultural cooperatives in Pingwo Township, Jianyang County. More than 100 people registered at the time, and more than 100 people left on their own that night and the next morning, followed by another 200 or so. Some employers randomly recruit farmers to work through personal connections and collusion. For example, the 301 Logging Farm in Li County had worker Zhang Jianjin send the worker recruitment certificate to his brother Zhang Jianfu, who was an accountant in the fifth community of the seventh village, to recruit workers. Wang Yongshu of the Western Sichuan Forestry Bureau even wrote an official letter to recruit former puppet Baozhangs and bandits.
    This phenomenon of private and random recruitment of farmers, in violation of the state's unified allocation, seriously affects spring plowing and the consolidation of cooperatives. Of the 112 farmers who left Taolai Township, Lezhi County, without authorization, half were cooperative cadres, including seven agricultural cooperative directors, five committee members, twenty-one production team leaders, and twenty-one accountants and record keepers. The third cooperative in the first village originally had 53 main laborers, but now only 32 are left; the sixth team has only three main laborers left. To this day, the cooperative has not finished cutting mountain grass, no one is digging soil ditches, and only 20% of the land has been processed. Only two ridges of the Shanwan pond have been dug. Because the accountant and record keeper left, the financial affairs and work point pre-settlements and final accounts are in chaos, and no one can figure it out. Cooperative members are all dejected. May I ask the employers, after you have taken the farmers away, how will agricultural production be carried out this year? Yang Ding

　  乱拉农民影响春耕
    近来四川森林工业局所属黑水、川西、道孚等分局，在四川射洪、乐至、三台、简阳、资阳、中江等地区乱招农民的现象很严重。乐至太来乡一个乡就已经有一百多人被招去了。简阳平窝乡有三百多人被招去了。2月8日和9日，简阳平窝乡有位自称是道孚森林工业局技工叫谢明三的，没有任何凭证便私自到农业社招收工人，当时进行登记的达一百多人，当晚和第二天早上就有一百多人私自走开了，接着又跑了二百多人。有的用人单位通过私人关系和串连等办法乱招农民去做工，理县301伐木场就是通过工人张建金，把招收工人的证明寄给他在七村五社当会计的兄弟张建福去招收的。川西森工局王永书还写了机关证明信，把当过伪保长，当过土匪的也拉了去。
    这种违背国家统一调配，私人乱招农民的现象严重地影响了春耕，影响了合作社的巩固。乐至太来乡私自外出的一百一十二个农民中，有一半是社干部，其中农业社主任七人，委员五人，生产队长二十一人，会计和记分员二十一人。一村三社原来有五十三个主要劳动力，现在只剩下三十二个了；六队只有三个主要劳动力了。至今，这个社山草还没有割完，土沟无人挖，土地加工仅完成了20％，山湾塘只挖了两根田坎。因为会计和记分员走了，财务和工分预决算乱成一团，谁也闹不清楚，社干社员都垂头丧气。请问用人单位，你们把农民拉走以后，今年的农业生产怎么搞呢？　杨丁
