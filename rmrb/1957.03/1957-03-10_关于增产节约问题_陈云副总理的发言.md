Vice Premier Chen Yun's Speech on the Issue of Increasing Production and Practicing Economy

Now, I would like to express some opinions on the current market situation and this year's campaign to increase production and practice economy.

The reason for the tight market supply last year was that the growth of social purchasing power exceeded the growth of materials.

Recently, people have often asked why the supply of many materials was relatively tight in the second half of 1956. Will the situation in 1957 be better than in 1956? As everyone knows, 1956 was a year of tremendous upsurge in China's national economy. At the same time, mainly in the second half of last year, the supply of many materials on the market was relatively tight. The materials in short supply can be divided into three categories: The first category is meat and non-staple foods. The supply of pork and eggs has been tight in many places for several years, but in 1956, more places experienced a tight supply. The second category of materials in short supply is some daily necessities, such as bicycles, paper, cotton cloth, etc. In the second half of the year, in large and medium-sized cities, wool fabrics, leather shoes, wool yarn, radios, etc., also experienced a situation where demand exceeded supply. The third category of materials in short supply is production materials, such as pig iron, steel, timber, cement, etc. Because the supply of steel and timber was tight, the supply of hardware materials was also tight. In the winter of 1956, in several northern cities, stoves and firewood were also in short supply. The above-mentioned tight supply of various materials mainly occurred in cities. So, why was the supply of some materials so tight in 1956? Has the production of these materials declined? No, except for pork, the production of most of the other materials, whether daily necessities or production materials, greatly exceeded that of 1955. The total industrial output value in 1956 increased by more than 25% compared to 1955. Compared with 1955, the percentage increase in the output of the following consumer goods was quite large: bicycles increased by about 86%, machine-made paper increased by about 23%, cotton yarn increased by about 31%, wool fabrics increased by about 36%, wool yarn increased by about 50%, and radios increased by about 79%. There are no complete statistics on the output of leather shoes, but the state's supply of cattle hides increased by about 90%. The percentage increase in the output of the following production materials was also not small: pig iron increased by about 20%, steel increased by about 54%, and cement increased by about 41%. Only timber increased relatively little, only 0.4%. Not only that, in 1956, not only were all the above-mentioned produced materials supplied to the market, but also a portion of the previous year's inventory was used. The supply of pork was tight because the production of pigs decreased during the period from June 1954 to June 1956 (the number of pigs raised nationwide was more than 60 million in the early days of liberation, more than 100 million in June 1954, and more than 80 million in June 1956). This was because not enough feed was left after the unified purchase of grain, and the purchase price of pigs was also too low. But even so, the total amount of pork supplied to many large cities in 1956 still increased compared to 1955. Moreover, the supply of other meats, such as beef, mutton, chicken, duck, fish, and shrimp, increased nationwide in 1956 compared to 1955. From the above situation, it can be seen that the vast majority of materials in short supply in 1956 not only did not decrease in production, but also increased in production.

So, why was the supply of these materials tight? This is because the degree of increase in social purchasing power in 1956 exceeded the degree of increase in these materials.

1956 was a year of great growth in social purchasing power. We only need to point out the following points to see the outline of the growth of social purchasing power. The first is the increase in basic construction investment in 1956. In the first year of the First Five-Year Plan, namely 1953, the basic construction investment was about 6.5 billion yuan, about 7.5 billion yuan in 1954, about 8.6 billion yuan in 1955, and increased to 14 billion yuan in 1956, an increase of 5.4 billion yuan compared to 1955. With the increase in basic construction investment, the demand for pig iron, steel, timber, and cement increased, and the number of employees also increased. The second is the increase in the total wages paid by the government and state-owned enterprises in 1956. The total amount of wages paid in 1953 was about 6.5 billion yuan, about 7.4 billion yuan in 1954, about 8.3 billion yuan in 1955, and increased to 10.7 billion yuan in 1956. The increase of 2.4 billion yuan in 1956 compared to 1955 was partly used for increased wages for existing employees, and partly for wages paid to newly added employees. The original plan for 1956 was to add 840,000 new employees, but the actual result was an increase of more than 2.2 million employees, plus more than 600,000 students in secondary technical schools and technical training classes subsidized by the state, for a total increase of more than 2.8 million employees nationwide. With the increase in total wage expenditure, the demand for pork, non-staple foods, and various consumer goods increased. The third is the increase in agricultural loans. At the end of 1953, more than 600 million yuan in agricultural loans were issued, nearly 800 million yuan at the end of 1954, about 1 billion yuan at the end of 1955, and reached more than 3 billion yuan at the end of 1956. Most of the agricultural loans were used to purchase agricultural production materials, but a portion was also used to purchase consumer goods. Based on the above basic construction investment, total wages, and the amount of agricultural loans, it can be seen that 1956 was a year in which social purchasing power increased particularly much. Although industrial and agricultural production increased in 1956, social purchasing power increased even faster, requiring more materials for market supply.

The above three expenditures in 1956, namely basic construction investment, total wages, and agricultural loans, were mostly necessary and appropriately used. As everyone knows, before 1956, many new construction projects were in the survey and design stage, and equipment imports and construction and installation were concentrated in 1956 or 1957. Therefore, basic construction investment in 1956 should be more than in previous years. In 1954 and 1955, the wages of employees in some departments increased relatively little. Therefore, employee wages should have been appropriately increased in 1956. 1956 was the first year of nationwide agricultural cooperation. It was also necessary to issue more agricultural loans to support the production of agricultural cooperatives. But now it seems that a small portion of the above three expenditures could have been reduced or not spent. For example, basic construction investment could have been reduced by a portion; in terms of wage payments, too many new employees were added, the scope of employee promotions was excessively expanded, a small portion of people's wages were increased too much, and some places inappropriately paid welfare expenses and bonuses; a portion of agricultural loans could have been not issued; in terms of administrative expenses and other expenses, there were also improperly used portions. Because these funds were overspent, the expenditure in 1956 exceeded the income in that year, and a portion of the previous year's fiscal surplus had to be used, which in reality meant using state reserves and commercial departments' inventory to offset the expenses. Because the state's inventory and turnover of certain materials decreased, a tight supply of some production materials and consumer goods appeared in 1956. However, it must be seen that although the supply of certain materials was tight in 1956, the overall market was still stable. As mentioned earlier, the shortage of certain consumer goods was not due to a decline in production, but rather to the result of a large increase in production, an increase of more than 2 million in the number of employees, an increase in wages for employees nationwide, and an increase in purchasing power for farmers. This fact itself shows that people's lives have improved. The tight supply of production materials, although a difficulty we encountered, is a temporary difficulty in construction. Obviously, the purpose of construction is to overcome this difficulty.

This tight supply situation will change in a few months.

Although the market situation in the second half of 1956 showed a certain degree of temporary tension, this situation is currently changing and will change in a few months. We have the conditions to improve this situation.

As we have said before, 1956 was a year of fundamental transformation and tremendous growth in production in China's national economy. Our agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce have basically completed socialist transformation. We have passed the fourth year of the Five-Year Plan, and in 1956, we completed a huge amount of basic construction work. The accumulated amount of investment completed in four years has exceeded 80% of the total investment of the Five-Year Plan, guaranteeing the completion of the Five-Year Plan. The total industrial output value in 1956 has exceeded the target for 1957, the final year of the Five-Year Plan. The increase in the number of employees and the increase in the average wages of employees have also exceeded the original targets for 1957. 1956 was a year in which China's agriculture was based on cooperation for production. Although it suffered natural disasters on a larger scale than in 1954, and although most of the cadres of agricultural production cooperatives lacked experience in running cooperatives, the output of grain and many industrial raw material crops still exceeded that of 1955. Cotton production was slightly lower than in 1955, but many provinces and regions had bumper harvests. In 1956, after cooperation, farmers across the country carried out basic farmland water conservancy construction on an unprecedented scale. For thousands of years, until 1955, the area of paddy fields and irrigated land in China accounted for only 480 million mu out of the total cultivated area of more than 1.6 billion mu; but the cooperative farmers increased the irrigated area by 100 million mu in 1956 alone. This one thing shows the enormous power that agricultural cooperation has given to China's agricultural production. In 1956, the first year of cooperation, the state used huge loans to support agricultural production cooperatives, which was absolutely necessary. The effect of cooperation on agricultural development will become clearer in the next few years.

Based on the great achievements in 1956, we believe that as long as the government makes appropriate arrangements in terms of finance and carries out a systematic campaign to increase production and practice economy nationwide, the market situation in 1957 can be improved.

Carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy this year is of particular importance.

Now I want to talk about why we should launch a nationwide campaign to increase production and practice economy in 1957. Increasing production and practicing economy is the basic method for carrying out socialist construction. In 1957, increasing production and practicing economy is of particular importance. First, we know that 1957 is the final year of China's First Five-Year Plan. In this year, we must overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan and lay a good foundation for the Second Five-Year Plan. Second, 1956 was a year in which China's agriculture suffered disasters, and the affected area exceeded that of 1954. The agricultural economy accounts for a very large proportion of China's economy, and the poor harvest of agriculture directly affects all aspects of fiscal revenue. The great flood in 1954 made it impossible for the fiscal revenue in 1955 to grow at a normal rate (comparing only the current domestic revenue of the two years, excluding the previous year's surplus and foreign loans), and could only be equivalent to that of 1954. The agricultural disasters in 1956 made it impossible for the fiscal revenue in 1957 to greatly exceed that of 1956, and it is estimated that it can only slightly exceed it. Third, as mentioned earlier, a portion of the state's reserves and commercial departments' inventory of materials was used in 1956. Therefore, the state's financial and material situation in 1957 will be like this: the fiscal revenue in 1957 is expected to increase little compared to 1956, and the state's reserves and commercial departments' inventory of materials in 1957 have already decreased compared to 1956. However, the vast majority of basic construction projects must proceed as usual, and projects that should be completed must be completed. Therefore, although basic construction investment can be slightly reduced compared to 1956, it must still be carried out on a necessary scale. At the same time, as mentioned above, more than 2 million new employees were added in China in 1956. These more than 2 million employees were added gradually in each month of 1956. Not everyone received 12 months' salary last year, but they will receive a full year's salary this year. The increased wages for employees nationwide last year were issued starting on April 1st, only for three quarters, but this year they will be issued for four quarters. The state must guarantee the necessary construction needs, employee wages, and other expenditures. These are the needs of the state's finances in terms of expenditure in 1957. In order to make the state's fiscal expenditure suitable for fiscal revenue, and to make the consumption of materials suitable for the possibility of increased production, the government believes that it is necessary to save on all expenditures that can be reduced, and to do everything possible to increase the production of all materials that can be increased, and to call on the people of the whole country and the government to carry out a campaign to increase production and practice economy together. In short, we must make every effort to ensure the completion of the 1957 economic plan, and to ensure the balance of state fiscal revenue and expenditure in 1957, so that the tight supply of several materials turns to a more relaxed situation.

What are the ways to increase production and practice economy? From what aspects should we carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy?

First, agriculture is an extremely important economic sector in China. We ask farmers, agricultural production cooperatives, and agricultural workers across the country to launch a nationwide agricultural production increase campaign like last year, to summarize all the experiences and lessons of 1956, to consolidate the achievements already obtained, to overcome the shortcomings in the work of 1956, to further consolidate agricultural production cooperatives, and to strive for a bumper harvest in 1957.

Second, all industrial sectors, whether state-owned enterprises, joint state-private enterprises, cooperative enterprises, or individual handicraftsmen, must launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy. Within the scope permitted by raw materials and the market, all industrial enterprises must strive to increase the quantity and variety of products, improve quality, and reduce costs. Raw material industrial sectors such as metallurgy, coal, timber, and electricity should raise production targets as much as possible. Employees, technical personnel, and management personnel should conduct extensive discussions to find effective ways to increase production, launch labor competitions, and strive to overfulfill the state's plan. All manufacturing sectors should save raw materials and widely adopt substitute raw materials and waste materials that are indeed usable, on the premise of ensuring quality. Enterprises with insufficient production tasks should carry out trial production of new products as long as conditions permit.

All campaigns to increase production and practice economy must prevent various abnormal methods, such as only paying attention to quantity and not quality, only paying attention to production and not safety, or relaxing equipment maintenance, wasting resources, and neglecting balanced production. It is necessary to resolutely avoid any nominal increase in production and practice economy, which actually causes waste.

Third, the basic construction work of central departments and provinces and cities across the country must be properly arranged according to the state's financial allocation plan. Reduce projects that can be reduced, ensure projects that must be started in terms of financial and material resources, do not reduce them equally, and choose the most reasonable plan and appropriately arrange projects to be started. In 1957, general civilian buildings should be stopped, except for employee dormitories, school buildings, and the like that are urgently needed. For construction projects that are postponed, scaled down, or temporarily cancelled, the work of surplus personnel must be properly arranged, and the buildings that have been built must be rationally utilized and maintained.

Designers must conduct serious discussions, study the experience of the past few years, and realistically make some design plans suitable for various different conditions in various places. On the premise of ensuring quality, the shortcomings of excessive safety factors, excessively high construction standards, and excessively wide economic and technical quotas in certain projects should be overcome. For civil buildings, the tendency of pursuing luxury and excessively high standards, which reappeared in 1956, should be corrected based on the principles of applicability and economic rationality. For urban construction, the tendency of excessive scale, excessively high standards, excessive land occupation, and excessive urgency should be corrected. For the expansion of old cities, it should be carried out gradually on the basis of full utilization of the original, and the demolition of civilian houses should be strictly prohibited too much or too early. The practice of connecting large cities and nearby small and medium-sized towns into one piece should be stopped.

The government requires all construction units across the country to mobilize employees, technical personnel, and management personnel to conduct discussions, and generally requires a reduction in construction costs of 5% on the premise of ensuring project quality.

Fourth, all transportation and commercial sectors must carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy. Railways, highways, waterways, aviation, and postal and telecommunications departments should take practical measures to increase transportation and communication capacity. Various transportation departments should strive to save fuel consumption, strengthen cooperation with consignors, and change various phenomena that waste transportation capacity. Various commercial departments should formulate practical national distribution plans for major commodities and strive to reduce commodity circulation costs. Overlapping commercial institutions should be adjusted, statistical, financial, and accounting systems should be simplified, the personnel of management institutions should be streamlined, and business units should be enriched. Give play to the creativity of employees, implement various reasonable and effective methods, reduce commodity losses, and earnestly overcome various wasteful phenomena.

Fifth, government departments, military organs, administrative management departments of factories and enterprises, all schools, and institutions must streamline their organizations and strictly save administrative management expenses. The phenomenon of overstaffing in management organs must be changed, and the method of simplifying the upper levels and strengthening the lower levels must be earnestly implemented. All factories and enterprises must strictly implement labor plans and must not recruit workers on their own. Military and government organs across the country must streamline their organizations and must not increase personnel. All personnel who are streamlined must have proper work arrangements, otherwise they will remain in the original organs. All personnel who are assigned to lower-level units or other places to work should obey the government's transfer.

In government, military, factories, enterprises, schools, and institutions, in addition to salary expenses and expenses related to production and circulation, other management expenses are about 2.5 billion yuan per year, which is a very large expenditure. Many of these expenditures are indispensable, but there are many expenses that can be saved, and the phenomenon of waste is serious. We must carry out an economy campaign, earnestly promote the style of hard work and sharing weal and woe with the masses, and resolutely stop extravagance and waste and separation from the masses. The purchase of furniture and vehicles should be stopped, office miscellaneous expenses should be reduced, and banquets and gifts should be strictly prohibited except in specific occasions, and the waste in meetings and recreational activities should be corrected. For materials in short supply, priority should be given to reducing the supply to organs and groups. In order to effectively implement the saving of management fees, the government stipulates that for organs whose expenses are paid by the national financial department, the financial department should deduct the part of the management fee that should be saved in advance and not issue it. Military organs should also do the same. The management expenses of factories and enterprises should be compared with the proportion of savings in the management expenses of government organs, and the part that should be saved should be listed as profit to be turned over and paid into the national treasury. We must save all expenses that can be saved in order to ensure the necessary expenditures for construction and administration.

Sixth, among the people of the whole country, we must also promote the movement of saving and saving according to specific circumstances. The current living standard of our people is still very low compared to economically developed countries. However, after more than seven years of efforts by our people, it has been improved to a certain extent compared to the early days of liberation. There is no miracle of reaching the sky in one step in the world, we can only move forward step by step on the original basis. To build our motherland, which has been backward for hundreds of years, into an economically developed country, it will take decades of effort. Currently, there are several consumer goods in our country that are in short supply, such as pork, cooking oil, etc. The government has decided that, in addition to launching a large-scale pig breeding campaign, the amount of pork exported in 1957 will be reduced by two-thirds compared to 1956, and the amount of cooking oil exported will be reduced. However, China has a large population, and even if exports are reduced, it will still be difficult to meet the needs of the people. Therefore, the government hopes that the people of the whole country will endure temporary difficulties for the sake of long-term interests and save on the consumption of commodities that are currently in short supply. At the same time, it is hoped that everyone will purchase public bonds and save money according to their own abilities.

Because of the agricultural disasters in 1956, the government has decided to greatly reduce the amount of grain purchased under the unified purchase system for the grain year from July 1956 to June 1957 compared to the previous year, and at the same time, greatly increase the supply of grain to disaster areas. This is necessary. However, the national grain revenue and expenditure for this year is tight. In order to ensure the necessary grain for the people across the country and to support the people in disaster areas, the government requires the people across the country to save half a catty or one catty of grain per person per month on the consumption standards stipulated by the government, and to overcome all phenomena of wasting grain.

We require governments, armies, factories, enterprises, schools, and institutions to make plans to increase production and practice economy based on the circumstances of each unit, and to vigorously launch a nationwide campaign to increase production and practice economy.

We believe that as long as the above-mentioned items are implemented, as long as the government makes appropriate arrangements for the fiscal revenue and expenditure in 1957, and as long as the people of the whole country work together to increase production and practice economy, then our temporary and local difficulties can definitely be overcome. Except for certain materials, such as pork, cooking oil, cotton cloth, timber, etc., the increase in production requires a longer period of effort, the tight supply situation of other materials can be alleviated. A large population and large consumption are a difficulty in China's economic life. But it is precisely because of the large population that as long as everyone saves a little, it is a huge amount. Since liberation more than seven years ago, we have experienced many difficulties, but as long as the government explains the difficult situation to the people, the people will cooperate with the government to overcome the difficulties that hinder our progress one by one. We firmly believe that the people of the whole country will cooperate with the government as they have done in the past seven years and carry out a huge campaign to increase production and practice economy. This campaign will not only quickly and smoothly overcome the difficulties of 1957, but will also successfully complete China's First Five-Year Plan. (Attached image)

    关于增产节约问题
    陈云副总理的发言
    我现在就目前的市场状况和今年的增产节约问题，发表一点意见。
    去年市场供应紧张的原因，是社会购买力增长的程度超过了物资增长的程度
    近来常有人问，为什么1956年下半年有不少物资供应的状况比较紧张？1957年的情况能否比1956年好些？大家知道，1956年是我国国民经济巨大高涨的一年，同时，主要是去年下半年市场上也有不少物资供应比较紧张。供应不足的物资可分为三类：第一类是肉类和副食品。许多地方几年来猪肉、蛋品的供应就是紧张的，但是1956年有更多的地方出现了供应紧张的现象。第二类供应紧张的物资是一些日用品，像自行车、纸张、棉布等等。下半年在大中城市，呢绒、皮鞋、毛线、收音机等等也发生供不应求的现象。第三类供应紧张的物资是生产资料，像生铁、钢材、木材、水泥等等。因为钢铁、木材供应紧张，五金材料的供应也就紧张。1956年的冬季，在几个北方城市，火炉、烧柴也供不应求。上述各类物资供应紧张的情况，主要出现在城市。那末，为什么1956年有些物资的供应这样紧张？这些物资的产量是否下降了？不是的，除了猪肉以外，其他物资无论是日用品或者是生产资料，1956年的产量绝大部分都大大超过了1955年。1956年的工业总产值比起1955年来增长了25％以上。1956年和1955年比较，下列几种消费品产量增长的百分比很不小：自行车增长约86％，机制纸增长约23％，棉纱增长约31％，呢绒增长约36％，毛线增长约50％，收音机增长约79％。皮鞋的产量缺少完整的统计材料，但是国家对牛皮的供应量增加了约90％。下列几种生产资料产量增长的百分比也不小：生铁增长约20％，钢材增长约54％，水泥增长约41％。只是木材增长较少，只有0.4％。不但如此，1956年不仅把上述几种生产了的物资全部供应了市场，而且把这些物资的上年库存也动用了一部分。猪肉的供应是紧张的，原因是1954年6月以后到1956年6月止的这一段时间中，猪的产量减少了（全国养猪量，解放初期是六千多万头，1954年6月是一亿多头，1956年6月是八千多万头）。这是由于统购粮食以后，饲料留得不够，猪的收购价格也偏低。但是即使如此，许多大城市1956年的猪肉供应总数，仍然比1955年增加了。而且全国各地其他肉类的供应量，像牛肉、羊肉、鸡、鸭、鱼、虾，1956年比起1955年都有了增加。由上述情况可以看出，1956年供应紧张的物资，绝大多数不但没有减产，而且都增产了。
    那末，这些物资的供应为什么紧张呢？这是由于，1956年社会购买力增长的程度，超过了这些物资增长的程度。
    1956年是社会购买力有很大增长的一年。我们只要指出下列各点，就可以看出社会购买力增长的轮廓。第一是1956年基本建设投资额的增长。第一个五年计划的第一年，即1953年，基本建设投资额约为六十五亿元，1954年约为七十五亿元，1955年约为八十六亿元，1956年则增为一百四十亿元，比1955年增加了五十四亿元。基本建设投资增加了，生铁、钢材、木材、水泥的需要量就要增加，就业人数也就增加。第二是1956年由政府和国营企业支付的工资总额的增加。1953年支付工资的总额约为六十五亿元，1954年约为七十四亿元，1955年约为八十三亿元，1956年则增为一百零七亿元。1956年比1955年增加了二十四亿元，其中一部分用于原有职工增加的工资，另一部分支付新增加职工的工资。1956年原定计划新增职工八十四万人，但是实际执行的结果，增加了职工二百二十余万人，连同国家补贴助学金的中等技术学校和技工训练班的六十余万人，全国新增加了二百八十余万人。工资总额支出增加了，猪肉、副食品和各种消费品的需要量就要增加。第三是农业贷款的增加。1953年底放出的农贷六亿余元，1954年底放出的近八亿元，1955年底放出的约十亿余元，1956年底放出的达三十亿余元。农贷的大部分是用于购置农业生产资料，但是也有一部分用于购买消费资料。根据上述的基本建设投资额、工资总额、农业贷款数量来看，可以看出1956年是社会购买力增加得特别多的一年。1956年的工农业产量虽然都增加了，但是社会购买力增加得更快，对市场供应的物资需要得更多。
    1956年上述三项支出，即基本建设投资、工资总额和农业贷款，绝大部分都是必要的和用得适当的。大家知道，1956年以前，许多新建工程处在勘察设计阶段，设备进口和建筑安装集中在1956年或者1957年，因此，1956年的基本建设投资应当比往年多。1954年和1955年有些部门职工工资增加得比较少，因此，1956年职工工资应当有适当地增加。1956年是全国农业合作化的第一年，为了支持农业合作社的生产，多发放些农业贷款也是必要的。但是现在看来，上述三项支出中有一小部分是可以少支出或者不支出的。例如，基本建设投资可以少支出一部分；工资支付方面，新增加的职工过多，过多地扩大了职工的升级面，有一小部分人员的工资加得太多，有些地方不适当地支付了福利费用和奖金；农业贷款中有一部分可以不发放；行政开支和其他支出方面，也还有用得不当的部分。因为多支出了这些款项，使1956年当年的支出超过了当年的收入，不得不动用一部分上年财政结余，实际上也就是要用国家储备和商业部门的库存物资去抵付。由于国家的某些物资库存量和周转量减少了，就使1956年一部分生产资料和消费品出现了供应紧张的现象。但是，必须看到，1956年某些物资的供应虽然是紧张的，可是就市场的全局来说，仍然是稳定的。正如前面所说，某些消费品的不足，并不是由于生产下降，而是在生产大量增长的情况下，就业人数增加了二百多万、全国职工增加了工资、农民增加了购买力的结果。这个事实本身，就说明了这是人民生活有了改进。生产资料的供应紧张，虽是我们所遇到的一种困难，但这是建设中的暂时的困难，很显然，建设的目的，就是为了克服这种困难。
    这种供应紧张状况在几个月以后就会有改变
    1956年下半年的市场状况虽然表现了某种程度的暂时的紧张，但是这种状况目前正在发生变化，而且在几个月以后就会有改变。我们有改进这种状况的条件。
    我们在前面已经说过，1956年是我国国民经济发生了根本转变和生产巨大高涨的一年。我国农业、手工业和资本主义工商业已经基本上完成了社会主义改造。我们已经走过了五年计划的第四年，1956年完成了巨大的基本建设的工作，四年累计已经完成了五年计划总投资额的80％以上，完成五年建设计划已经有了保证。1956年的工业总产值，已经超过了五年计划最后一年1957年的指标。职工人数的增加和职工平均工资的增加，也都超过了1957年原计划的指标。1956年我国农业是在合作化基础上进行生产的一年，虽然遭到了比1954年范围更大的自然灾害，虽然农业生产合作社的大多数干部，办社的经验还不足，但是粮食和许多工业原料作物的产量，仍然超过了1955年。棉花产量是略低于1955年，但有许多省区是丰收的。1956年全国农民在合作化以后，用空前的规模进行了农田水利的基本建设，几千年来，直到1955年为止，我国的水田、水浇地的面积，在十六亿多亩的全部耕地面积中，总共只有四亿八千万亩；但是合作化了的农民，在1956年一年之内，就增加了灌溉面积一万万亩。这一件事，就可以看出农业合作化给了我国农业生产何等巨大的力量。国家在1956年，即合作化的第一年，用巨大的贷款来支持农业生产合作社，这是完全必要的。合作化对于农业发展的效果，将在今后若干年内看得更加清楚。
    在1956年巨大成绩的基础上，我们认为只要政府在财政方面安排得适当，并且在全国范围内有系统地开展增产节约运动，1957年的市场情况就可以好转。
    今年开展增产节约具有特别重要的意义
    现在我要说一说为什么我们要在1957年开展一个全国范围的增产节约运动？增产节约，这是我们进行社会主义建设的基本方法。在1957年，增产节约具有特别重要的意义。第一，我们知道，1957年是我国第一个五年计划的最后一年，我们在这一年内要超额完成第一个五年计划，要为第二个五年计划打下良好的基础。第二，1956年是我国农业遭受灾害的一年，受灾范围超过了1954年。农业经济在我国经济中占有极大的比重，农业的歉收直接影响到财政收入的各个方面。1954年的大水灾，使得1955年的财政收入不能按正常比例增长（除去上年结余和国外贷款，只按两年的当年国内收入比较），而只能相等于1954年。1956年的农业灾害，使1957年的财政收入，也不可能大大超过1956年，估计只能微微超过。第三，正如前面说过，1956年动用了一部分国家储备和商业部门的物资库存。因此，1957年国家财力物力的情况将是这样：1957年的财政收入预计比1956年增加得不多，1957年国家储备和商业部门的物资库存比1956年已经减少。但是，绝大部分的基本建设工程必须照常进行，凡属应该完工的工程必须完工。因此，基本建设的投资，虽然可以比1956年略为减少，但是仍然必须在必要的规模上进行建设。同时上面也说过，1956年度我国新增加了二百多万职工，这二百多万职工是1956年度各个月份陆续增加的，去年并不是每个人都支领了十二个月的工资，但是在今年则要支领全年工资。去年全国职工所增加的工资是从4月1日开始发收的，只发了三个季度，今年就要发四个季度。国家必须保证必要的建设需要、职工工资和其他支出。这些，就是1957年国家财政在支出方面的需要。为了使国家的财政支出适合于财政收入，为了使物资的消费适合于增产的可能，政府认为必须对一切可以减少的支出，加以节约，对一切可以增产的物资，尽力增产，并且号召全国人民和政府一起进行增产节约运动。总之，我们必须作一切努力，保证1957年经济计划的完成，并且保证1957年国家财政收支的平衡，使若干种物资的供应紧张转向缓和。
    增产节约的途径我们应当从那些方面进行增产节约呢？
    第一、农业是我国极其重要的经济部门。我们要求全国农民、农业生产合作社和农业工作者，像去年一样开展全国农业的增产运动，总结1956年的一切经验教训，巩固已经得到的成绩，克服1956年工作中的缺点，进一步巩固农业生产合作社，争取1957年的大丰收。
    第二、一切工业部门，不论是国营企业、公私合营企业、合作社企业或者个体手工业者都必须开展一个增产节约运动。在原料和市场允许的范围内，一切工业企业都必须为增加产品的数量和品种、提高质量、降低成本而斗争。冶金、煤炭、木材、电力等等原料工业部门，应当尽可能提高生产指标，职工群众、技术人员和管理人员应当广泛的进行讨论，找寻增产的有效办法，开展劳动竞赛，努力超额完成国家的计划。所有制造部门，应当在保证质量的前提下，节约原材料，广泛采用那些确实可用的代用原料和废料。生产任务不足的企业，只要条件可能，应当进行新产品的试制工作。
    增产节约运动都必须防止各种不正常的办法，例如只顾数量、不顾质量，只顾生产、不顾安全，或者放松设备检修，浪费资源，忽视均衡生产等等。必须坚决避免任何名义上的增产节约，实际上造成浪费的现象。
    第三、中央各部门和全国各省市的基本建设工作，必须根据国家财力分配的计划，进行妥善安排。削减那些可以削减的项目，在财力物力上保证必须开工的项目，不要平均主义地削减，应当选择最合理的方案，适当安排开工建设的项目。在1957年，除了十分迫切需要的职工宿舍、学校校舍等以外，一般的民用建筑应当停止修建。凡属推迟进度、缩小规模或暂时取消的建设项目，对于多余人员的工作必须妥善地安排，合理地利用和维护已经建成的建筑物。
    设计人员必须进行认真讨论，研究几年来的经验，实事求是地作出一些适合于各地各种不同情况的设计方案。应当在保证质量的前提下，克服某些项目安全系数过大、建设标准过高、经济技术定额过宽的缺点。对于民用建筑应当根据适用和经济上合理的原则，纠正那种在1956年又重新抬头的某些追求豪华和标准过高的偏向。对于城市建设，必须纠正规模过大、标准过高、占地过多、要求过急的偏向。对于旧城市的扩建，应当在充分利用原有基础上逐步进行，严禁过多过早地拆除民房。应当制止那种把大城市和附近中小城镇连成一片的做法。
    政府要求全国所有施工单位，发动职工、技术人员和管理人员进行讨论，在保证工程质量的前提下，一般要求达到降低建筑成本百分之五。
    第四、一切运输业、商业部门都必须进行增产节约运动。铁路、公路、水路、航空和邮电各部门，应该采取切实措施，增加运输和通讯的能力。运输各部门应当努力节约燃料的消耗，同托运单位加强合作，改变各种浪费运输能力的现象。各个商业部门，应当制定切合实际的主要商品的全国分配计划，努力降低商品的流转费用。应当调整那些重叠的商业机构，简化统计、财务、会计制度，精简管理机构的人员，充实营业单位。发挥职工群众创造性，推行各种合理有效的办法，减少商品的损耗，认真克服各种浪费现象。
    第五、政府部门、军事机关、工厂企业的行政管理部门，一切学校和事业单位，都必须精简机构，严格节约行政管理费用。必须改变管理机关人浮于事的现象，认真实行精简上层，加强下层的办法。一切工厂企业必须严格实行劳动计划，不得自行招工。全国军政机关必须精简机构，不得增加人员。凡属被精简的人员，必须有妥善的工作安置，否则留在原机关不动。一切被分配到下层单位或其他地方工作的人员，应当服从政府的调配。
    政府、军队、工厂、企业、学校、事业单位中，除了工薪开支和与生产、流转有关的费用以外，其他管理费用，全年约有二十五亿元，这是一笔很大的开支。其中许多支出是不可少的，但是可以节省的开支是很多的，浪费的现象是严重存在的。我们必须进行一个节约运动，认真提倡艰苦奋斗、与群众同甘共苦的作风，坚决制止铺张浪费、脱离群众的现象。应当停止购置家具和车辆，减少办公杂支，除特定场合外，严禁请客送礼，纠正开会方面和文娱活动中的浪费。凡属供应紧张的物资，首先应当减少对机关团体的供应。为了有效地实行管理费的节约，政府规定，凡属由国家财政部门发经费的机关，应当由财政部门把管理费中应当节约的部分，预先扣除，不予发给。军事机关，也应当这样办。工厂企业的管理费用，应当比照政府机关管理费用的节约比例，把应当节约的部分，列为上缴利润，缴入国库。我们必须把一切可省的开支加以节省，以便保证建设和行政方面的必要支出。
    第六、在全国人民中间，我们也要按照具体情况，提倡节约和储蓄的运动。我国人民的目前生活水平，比起经济发达的国家来，还是很低的。但是经过我国人民七年多的努力，比解放初期已经有了一定程度的改善。世界上没有一步登天的奇迹，我们只能在原有基础上逐步前进。要把已经落后了上百年的祖国，建设成为经济发达的国家，需要有几十年的努力。目前我国有若干种消费品是供应不足的，例如，猪肉、食油等等，政府已经决定，除了发动大量养猪以外，在1957年度比1956年度减少猪肉出口量的三分之二，减少食油出口。但是我国人口众多，即令减少了出口，也仍然难以满足人民的需要。因此，政府希望全国人民为了长远的利益，忍受暂时的困难，对于目前供应不足的商品，节约消费。同时希望按照各人的可能，将现金购买公债和实行储蓄。
    因为1956年的农业灾害，1956年7月到1957年6月的粮食年度中，政府已经决定对于粮食的统购数量比前一个年度大大减少，同时供应灾区的粮食又大大增加，这样做是必要的。但是这个年度的国家粮食收支是紧张的，为了保证全国人民必需的粮食，为了支援灾区人民，政府要求全国人民在政府规定的消费标准上，每人每月节约半斤或一斤粮食，并克服一切浪费粮食的现象。
    我们要求政府、军队、工厂、企业、学校、事业单位，根据各个单位的情况，作出增产节约的方案，有力地开展全国增产节约运动。
    我们认为只要实行上述各条，只要政府对1957年的财政收支作出适当的安排，只要全国人民大家动手进行增产节约，那末，我们一时的局部的困难一定可以克服。除了某些物资，像猪肉、食油、棉布、木材等等的增产，需要有较长时期的努力以外，其他物资供应紧张的情况，是可以缓和的。人口众多，消费量大，这是我国经济生活方面的一种困难。但是也正因为人口众多的缘故，只要每人节约出一点，就是一个庞大的数目。解放后七年多以来，我们经历了不少困难，但是只要政府把困难的情况向人民讲清楚，人民就与政府合作，把阻碍我们前进的困难，一个又一个地加以克服。我们深信全国人民会像过去七年一样，与政府通力合作，进行一个巨大的增产节约运动。这次运动，不仅将迅速地顺利地克服1957年的困难，而且将完满地完成我国第一个五年计划。（附图片）
