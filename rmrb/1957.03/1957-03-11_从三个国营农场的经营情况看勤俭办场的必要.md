From the operating conditions of three state-owned farms, we can see the necessity of running farms diligently and frugally.
	In the state-owned farms of Heilongjiang Province, three farms adopted two fundamentally different operating methods and obtained two fundamentally different operating results. The Shuguang and Keshan farms only focused on production and did not care about costs, thinking that it was enough to plant and harvest grain, regardless of how much money was spent. As a result, the costs were very high, the losses were great, and the state suffered serious losses. The Daxi Jiang Farm extensively and deeply mobilized all employees to implement the policy of running the farm diligently and frugally, being meticulous in every aspect and practicing strict economy. As a result, the costs were very low, and they increased a large amount of wealth for the state.
	Let's take a look at what these two different operating methods are like.
	First, let's look at the organizational structure and staffing: The Shuguang and Keshan farms, in setting up institutions and staffing, did not consider the amount of expenditure, only knowing to set up stalls at every level and excessively establishing indirect production personnel. The management agencies were huge, with administrative management personnel accounting for 22%-24% of the total number of employees. The Shuguang Farm had 18.4% of its employees exceeding the authorized size, of which indirect production personnel exceeded 72.9%. This item alone increased salary expenditure by more than 40,000 yuan. What was the situation at the Daxi Jiang Farm? When determining staffing levels, they repeatedly calculated carefully, reducing administrative management personnel to 11.9% of the total number of employees, half less than the Shuguang and Keshan farms.
	Let's look at the use of labor: In the Keshan Farm, the labor hours spent on non-productive and auxiliary work from January to October accounted for 23.4% of the total labor hours. At the Shuguang Farm, in a production team during the busy farming season from April to October, more than 3,000 labor days were used for non-production purposes. Because labor was not well organized and used, temporary workers were hired in large numbers at high prices during the busy farming season. The Keshan Farm's temporary worker wage expenditure totaled 600,000 yuan. The Shuguang Farm's temporary worker wage expenditure totaled more than 310,000 yuan. The situation at the Daxi Jiang Farm was exactly the opposite. They not only allocated and used labor well on weekdays, but also maximized internal potential during the busy farming season and basically did not hire temporary workers. Summer hoeing is the busiest farming season requiring the most manual labor. They mobilized all manpower, with all members of the production team except cooks and feeders working in the fields. Except for a few people who remained in the farm management to solve urgent problems, all other administrative staff went to the fields. At the same time, family members of employees who had the ability to work were organized to participate in summer hoeing, and organizational leadership was strengthened to improve labor efficiency. Therefore, only 48 temporary workers were hired at the busiest time, and the cost of summer hoeing operations was reduced by more than 20,000 yuan.
	As for the utilization rate of equipment, especially the utilization rate of transportation equipment, no one in the Shuguang and Keshan farms has ever paid attention to it. They believed that if the strength was insufficient, they could request allocation from higher authorities, and as for how much money was spent, that was another matter. At the Shuguang Farm, the vehicle operation rate from January to October was only 71.5%, the mileage traveled only reached 43.7% of the mileage that should have been traveled, and the load capacity only accounted for 59.5%. From this, it can be seen how low the utilization rate of vehicles was. The Keshan Farm's vehicle transportation only completed 59.3% of the plan. The farm's own vehicles could not complete the transportation tasks, so they had to request "reinforcements," resulting in a large amount of vehicle dispatching costs and other expenses, which increased transportation costs by 64.2%. What was the situation at the Daxi Jiang Farm? They only had seven vehicles, and the main transportation force was horse-drawn carts. They not only strengthened the allocation of transportation forces, improved the utilization rate, and basically eliminated idle labor and work stoppages, but also always calculated whether it was appropriate when using transportation forces. At the beginning of last spring, they planned to send 1,600 tons of manure to the fields, which required 600 cart drivers and would cost 48,000 yuan. People said, "This is terrible, the cost is too high!" So, they dispersed the breeding mares to the production teams and used the local farmers' small iron-wheeled carts to send manure, saving more than 3,000 yuan. The horse-drawn carts were used to transport construction materials, improving efficiency and completing the task of preparing construction materials.
	Let's look at the situation in production technology: At the Shuguang Farm, the situation of loss and waste during the autumn harvest was intolerable due to lack of supervision. In the farm's fifth production team, a piece of land was expected to yield more than 100 tons of soybeans, but after harvesting, there were only 60 tons. At this time, the production team leader realized that there was a problem with the harvesting. After going to the field, he exclaimed, "Oh no! 40% of the soybeans were left in the field!" Then, a large number of people were organized to go to the field to "pick up the crops." The average loss per hectare of wheat in the whole farm was more than 200 kilograms, and the loss per hectare of soybeans was more than 100 kilograms. After deducting the general natural loss, the two items together lost 669 tons of grain, worth more than 108,900 yuan. This is such a serious waste! The Daxi Jiang Farm was not like this. During the autumn harvest, the farm manager, production team leaders, and technicians personally went to the field every day to check, mobilizing employees to check each other, and reducing the harvesting loss to the minimum. They also mobilized employees to collect the half-cut wheat ears and wheat heads that could not be completely threshed on the edge of the drying yard, and studied methods of threshing them. The soybean grains covered with mud on the edge of the drying yard were collected, washed with water, and dried. Let me introduce another serious loss and waste situation in production technology. This may sound like a joke: When the Shuguang Farm was preventing insects in the summer, there were very few insects, but they panicked and shouted from top to bottom: "Catch the insects! Catch the insects!" How many insects were there? No one investigated and researched. So, more than 800,000 straw bundles were blindly set up, using more than 10,000 kilograms of sugar, more than 6,000 kilograms of wine, more than 7,000 kilograms of vinegar, and a large number of medicines, costing a total of more than 46,000 yuan. In the end, the insects caught cost five cents each. What expensive insects!
	Due to different operating methods, the problems reflected in property management were particularly obvious. The leaders of Keshan and Shuguang farms did not care about property management, the system was unsound, and no one from top to bottom was responsible. More than 38,000 kilograms of oil and more than 10,000 yuan worth of mechanical parts disappeared from the Keshan Farm, with accounts but no physical objects. Six bundles of iron plates were transported by truck, and one bundle was lost on the way without anyone knowing. The warehouse keeper did not look at the physical objects at all, but "accepted" them according to six bundles. Later, someone picked up the lost bundle and sent it back, only to realize that only five bundles were received at first. During the wheat harvest, a large number of sacks were lost due to lack of management, and it is still unclear. Recently, someone found a pile of more than 40 sacks buried in the snow in the field. At the Shuguang Farm, the consumption of raw materials exceeded the plan for every item, and the cost of consuming just five raw materials exceeded 110,000 yuan. The raw materials lost and short in the warehouse were found to be worth more than 6,700 yuan after one inventory. No one was responsible for the use and management of low-value and easily consumable goods, and the loss and damage were serious. Therefore, the cost per hectare reached 11.9 yuan. The Daxi Jiang Farm was completely different in property management. They adopted a mass management method. According to the operation plan for each farming period formulated by the production team, the consumption control limits for various main raw materials were set at each level from the production team to each work group, and handed over to the employees to control themselves. Over the limit, they were not allowed to issue them. The low-value and easily consumable goods used were all fixedly equipped in each group of the production team, and a dedicated person was assigned to be responsible for the management of each item. In this way, employees did their best to protect state property and save the use of raw materials. Therefore, the phenomenon of loss and waste of raw materials was basically eliminated, the cost was greatly reduced, and the consumption cost of low-value and easily consumable goods was only 3.6 yuan per hectare, which was much lower than that of the Shuguang Farm.
	The final results were: The Keshan Farm, although it achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest on a large area of 11,400 hectares due to good natural conditions, with an average yield of more than 1,620 kilograms per hectare of wheat and an average yield of 1,243 kilograms per hectare of soybeans, its costs were too high, so there was no profit in operation. (The farm is expected to profit more than 183,000 yuan, but the cost of reclaiming more than 4,900 hectares of wasteland last year was all reimbursed by the state and not included in the cost; if the plowing and harrowing cost of 30 yuan per hectare is added, not only will there be no profit in operation, but it will lose more than 114,000 yuan.) The Shuguang Farm, with an average yield of 958 kilograms per hectare of wheat and 1,089 kilograms per hectare of soybeans, lost more than 700,000 yuan due to high costs, with an average net loss of 112 yuan per hectare sown. The Daxi Jiang Farm, with an average yield of 1,516 kilograms per hectare of wheat and an average of 865 kilograms per hectare of soybeans (which is not high enough), used all old and dilapidated kerosene tractors purchased before 1950, and the cost of cultivation per hectare was more than 26 yuan higher than that of the diesel tractors of the Shuguang and Keshan farms, but they turned over a net profit of 110,000 yuan to the state.
	The facts clearly show that state-owned farms, as socialist agricultural enterprises, must prominently strengthen operation and management, deeply implement the policy of running farms diligently and frugally, and strictly practice economy in order to obtain good results. Otherwise, even if production is good, good results will never be obtained.

    从三个国营农场的经营情况看勤俭办场的必要
    丁履枢
    在黑龙江省的国营农场中，有三个农场采取了两种根本不同的经营方法，得到了两种根本不同的经营结果。曙光和克山两场，只管生产，不问成本，认为种地打粮食就行，不管花钱多少，结果成本很高，亏损很大，给国家造成了严重的损失。大西江农场广泛深入地发动全体职工贯彻执行勤俭办场的方针，处处精打细算，厉行节约，结果成本很低，给国家增加了大量财富。
    让我们看看这两种不同的经营方法是怎样的吧。
    先从组织机构和人员编制上来看：曙光和克山两场在设置机构和人员编制上，不问开支多少，只知道层层摆摊子，过多地设置间接生产人员，管理机构庞大，仅行政管理人员就占职工总数的22％—24％。曙光农场超过编制的人员占职工总数的18.4％，其中间接生产人员超过72.9％，仅此一项就增加工资支出四万多元。大西江农场的情况怎样呢？他们在确定人员编制的时候，反复地算细账，把行政管理人员压缩到占职工人数的11.9％，比曙光和克山两场少一半。
    再看看劳动力运用情况吧：克山农场1—10月间的全部劳动力中，从事非生产性工作和辅助性工作的人工占总工数的23.4％。曙光农场在一个生产队里4—10月间的农忙季节，非生产用人工就达三千多个，由于劳动力没有很好地组织运用，农忙时就不惜高价大量地雇用临时工。克山农场临时工工资支出共达六十万元。曙光农场临时工工资支出共达三十一万多元。大西江农场和这个情况恰恰相反，他们不仅在平日对劳动力很好地调配运用，而且，在农忙季节里最大限度地发挥内部潜力，基本上不雇临时工。夏锄是需要手工劳动最多的农忙季节，他们把全部人力都动员起来，生产队里除炊事员、饲养员以外，全部下地，场部的管理人员中除留下几人解决当前工作上迫切需要解决的问题，其余全部下地，同时把有劳动能力的职工家属全部组织起来，参加夏锄，并且加强了组织领导，提高了劳动效率，所以只在最忙的时候才雇了四十八个临时工，夏锄作业共降低成本两万多元。
    对于设备利用率，特别是运输设备的利用率，在曙光和克山两场一向是没人注意的，他们认为，反正力量不足就可以请求上级调拨，至于花钱多少，那是另外一回事。曙光农场，1—10月份汽车出车率仅为71.5％，行走里程只达到应走里程的43.7％，载重量只占59.5％，由此可见汽车的利用率之低。克山农场汽车运输仅完成计划的59.3％；自场的车辆完不成运输任务，只好请调“援兵”，于是大量地支出了调车费用及其他费用，结果使运输成本提高了64.2％。大西江农场的情况怎样呢？他们只有七辆汽车，主要的运输力量是马车。他们对于运输力量不仅加强了调配，提高了利用率，基本上消灭了闲工停工，而且在使用运输力时，总是先算一算是不是合适？去年春初向田里送粪一千六百吨，计划用六百个车工，他们算了一下要花四万八千元，人们都说，这还了得，成本太高！于是把繁殖母马分散到生产队去，使用当地农民的铁轮小车送粪，结果节省了三千多元，把马车抽出去运送基建材料，发挥了效率，完成了基建备料任务。
    再看看生产技术上的情况吧：曙光农场在秋收中，由于无人检查，损失浪费的情况，令人难以容忍。该场第五生产队有一块地预计能收获一百多吨大豆，收完后只有六十来吨，这时生产队长才发现收割有问题，下地一看，啊呀！40％的大豆扔在地里，这才组织大批人力下地“捡庄稼”。全场平均每公顷小麦损失二百多公斤，大豆每公顷损失达一百多公斤，扣除一般的自然耗损后，两项共损失六百六十九吨粮食，价值十万八千九百多元，这是多么严重的浪费！大西江农场就不是这个样子。他们在秋收中，场长、生产队长和技术人员等天天亲自下地检查，发动职工互相检查，把收割损失减少到最低限度；还发动职工们把晒场边上脱不净打不掉的半截麦穗、麦头子收集起来，研究出脱粒的办法，把晒场边上沾满泥土的大豆粒收起来，用水洗净晒干。让我再介绍一个生产技术上严重的损失浪费情况吧。说起来这好像是个笑话：曙光农场夏季防虫时，虫子本来寥寥无几，可是他们却惊慌失措，从上到下喊着：“抓虫子！抓虫子！”虫子究竟有多少？谁也没有调查研究，于是盲目地设置了八十多万个草把，用一万多公斤糖，六千多公斤酒，七千多公斤醋，还有大批药品，共计花了四万六千多元，最后抓到的虫子，每个合五分钱，好贵的虫子啊！
    由于经营方法不同，在财产管理上反映出来的问题尤其明显。克山和曙光两场对财产管理领导不过问，制度不健全，从上到下的无人负责。克山农场三万八千多公斤油料和价值一万多元的机械零件，有帐无物，不翼而飞；汽车运送六捆铁板，半路上丢掉一捆也不知道，到仓库里保管员根本不看实物，就按六捆“照收”，后来有人捡着丢掉的一捆送回来，才知道原先只收了五捆。麦收时大批麻袋无人管理，大量丢失，到现在也查找不清，最近有人在地里发现埋在雪堆里的麻袋一堆就有四十多条。曙光农场原材料消耗项项超过计划，仅五项原材料消耗费用就超过十一万多元。仓库丢失短缺的原材料，经一次清查就发现有价值六千七百多元。低值易耗品的使用和管理更无人负责，丢失损坏严重，因此每公顷的费用竟达十一元九角。大西江农场在财产管理上却完全不是这样。他们采取的是群众性的管理方法，根据生产队制定的每个农作时期的作业计划，从生产队到各个作业小组，都层层定出消耗各种主要原材料的控制限额，交由职工自行掌握，超过限额不准发给，把使用的低值易耗品，都固定配备在生产队的各个小组里，对每件物品都指定专人负责管理。这样职工们都尽一切力量爱护国家财产，节约使用原材料，因此原材料的损失浪费现象基本上消灭了，成本大大地降低了，低值易耗品耗损费用每公顷只有三元六角，比曙光农场低得多。
    最后的结果是：克山农场虽因自然条件好，在一万一千四百公顷的大面积上获得了全面丰收，小麦平均每公顷产量一千六百二十多公斤，大豆每公顷平均产量一千二百四十三公斤，但他们的成本过高，所以经营无利。（该场预计获利十八万三千多元，但他们去年开垦的四千九百多公顷荒地的开荒费用，全部由国家报销，未计入成本；如果每公顷加三十元的耕耙费用，则不仅经营无利，反而将亏损十一万四千多元。）曙光农场，小麦平均每公顷九百五十八公斤，大豆每公顷一千零八十九公斤，因为成本太高，亏损了七十多万元，平均每播种一公顷净赔一百一十二元。大西江农场，小麦平均每公顷一千五百一十六公斤，大豆每公顷平均八百六十五公斤（这是不够高的），他们使用的全部是1950年以前购入的破旧不堪的火油拖拉机，每公顷耕作费用比曙光、克山两场的柴油拖拉机高二十六元多，但他们却向国家上缴了十一万元的纯利润。
    事实清楚地表明，作为社会主义农业企业的国营农场，必须突出地加强经营管理，深入地贯彻勤俭办场的方针，严格厉行节约，才能得到良好的成果。否则，即使生产搞的好，也决不会得到好的结果。
