Anecdotes

(I)
    A young man asked Mozart how to write a symphony.
    Mozart said, "You are still very young, why not start by writing a minor piece?"
    The young man angrily said, "Didn't you start writing symphonies when you were only ten years old!"
    "Yes!" Mozart replied. "But at that time, I didn't ask anyone how to write a symphony."
(II)
    Heine once talked about his banker uncle in this way:
    "My mother loved literature and art, so I became a poet; and the mothers of my banker uncles were devoted to the adventures of bandits and cannons, so they became bankers."
                                                                                                                                                               (Compiled and translated by Xiao Yan)

    一个青年问莫扎特怎样写交响乐。
    莫扎特便说：“您还很年青，为什么不从写小调开始呢？”
    青年生气地说：“您岂不是只十岁，就开始写交响乐了！”
    “对呀！”莫扎特回答说。“不过，那时我没向任何人打听，如何来写交响乐。”
　　（二）
    海涅曾这样地谈到自己的银行家大叔：
    “我的母亲爱好文学艺术，所以我成了一个诗人；而我的那些银行家大叔的母亲倾心于强盗、大炮的冒险，因此，他们便成了银行家。”
              （小岩辑译）
