Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd: The Ministry of Education recently issued a notice regarding guiding primary and secondary school graduates to correctly handle the issues of enrollment in higher education and employment.

    The notice requires education administrative departments at all levels to list this work as one of the key tasks for the first half of this year. By elaborating on the purpose and tasks of primary and secondary school education, as well as the relationship between cultural and educational undertakings and production development, it should be explained that it is impossible for all primary and secondary school graduates to enter higher education. Students and parents should understand that, based on the development of production, education has already made great progress. In the future, with the development of production, the number of young people receiving higher education and secondary education will gradually increase; at the same time, it will also open up broader avenues for them to engage in labor. However, at present, there are still many difficulties for the country to enable more students to enter higher education, or to enable all primary and secondary school graduates who fail to enter school to engage in productive labor and work. In 1956, the number of primary and secondary school graduates entering higher education was relatively large, mainly because the enrollment plan for secondary schools was somewhat too large, which was a temporary and special phenomenon. In the future, for a considerable period, it will be impossible for all primary and secondary school graduates to enter higher education. The notice requires students and parents to treat the difficulties in the advancement of socialist construction with a spirit of patriotism.

    In school education, labor education should be one of the regular contents of ideological and political education. The notice believes that when conducting labor education for students, it should be combined with patriotism education, collectivism education, discipline education, education on the prospects of socialism, as well as education on hard work and thrift in building the country. The main force of propaganda and education work should be school leaders and teachers, and it should be carried out through both classroom and extracurricular activities. At the same time, it is necessary to attach importance to and give play to the positive role of the Communist Youth League organizations.

    The notice requires encouraging this year's primary and secondary school graduates to enter higher education if they can, and if they cannot, they should engage in necessary and possible productive labor according to the requirements of the state and their personal conditions. Those who do not have the conditions to participate in labor and work for the time being should study at home with peace of mind and prepare better conditions for engaging in productive labor or entering higher education in the future. The notice requires parents to adopt a sympathetic attitude when their children cannot enter higher education, comfort them, and provide them with the convenience of self-study or engaging in productive labor according to their own conditions. Parents of rural students are required to welcome their children to engage in agricultural production labor and help them master agricultural production technology as soon as possible. At the same time, it is required that rural grassroots cadres and cadres of agricultural production cooperatives warmly welcome this group of students who return to their hometowns to engage in agricultural production. In cities, in addition to organizing self-study groups, it is also advocated to hold radio lectures, cram schools, or encourage government agencies, organizations, factories, mines, enterprises, and private individuals to run tutoring schools to provide possible guidance for self-studying primary and secondary school graduates.

    正确对待升学和就业问题
    教育部要求各地加强中小学生的思想工作
    新华社3日讯  教育部在最近发出关于指导中小学毕业生正确对待升学和就业问题的通知。
    通知要求各级教育行政部门把这一工作列为今年上半年的重点工作之一。通过阐述中小学教育的目的任务以及文化教育事业和生产发展的关系，来说明中小学毕业生不可能全部升学的道理。要使学生和家长了解，在生产发展的基础上，教育事业已经有很大的发展。今后，随着生产事业的发展，青年一代受高等教育和中等教育的人数将逐渐增多；同时，也将为他们从事劳动开辟更广阔的道路。但是，目前要使更多的学生升学，或使考不上学校的所有中小学毕业生全部从事生产劳动和工作，国家还有很多困难。1956年中小学毕业生升学的人数较多，主要是由于中等学校招生计划偏大了些，这是一时的特殊现象。今后在一个相当长的时期内，中小学毕业生是不可能全部升学的。通知要求学生和学生家长本着爱国主义精神来对待社会主义建设事业前进中的困难。
    在学校教育中，劳动教育应作为经常的思想政治教育的内容之一。通知认为，在对学生进行劳动教育时，应该和爱国主义教育、集体主义教育、纪律教育、社会主义前途的教育、以及艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的教育结合起来。宣传教育工作的主要力量应该是学校领导干部和教师，通过课内和课外两方面来进行。同时，还必须重视和发挥青年团组织的积极作用。
    通知要求鼓励中小学本届毕业生毕业以后，能升学就升学，不能升学应根据国家的要求和个人的条件，从事必要和可能的生产劳动，一时没有参加劳动和工作条件的，应该在家安心自学，为将来从事生产劳动或升学准备更好的条件。通知要求家长在自己的子女不能升学时，采取同情的态度，安慰他们并根据自己的条件，给他们以自学或从事生产劳动的便利。农村学生的家长，要求他们欢迎自己的子女从事农业生产劳动，帮助他们尽快地掌握农业生产技术。同时要求农村基层干部和农业生产合作社的干部热诚欢迎这批回乡从事农业生产的学生。在城市，除了组织自学小组外，还提倡举办广播讲座、补习班，或鼓励机关、团体、厂矿企业、私人举办补习学校，给自学的中小学毕业生以可能的指导。
