Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 11th - Jiangsu Province's Wuxi, Juining, Siyang, and Jiangdu, along with twenty-two other counties, have restored and established over 250 livestock markets, extensively organizing livestock merchants to transfer and transport draught animals, piglets, and lambs in support of agricultural and sideline production.

According to statistics from eleven market towns, including Anfeng in Dongtai County, Daqiao in Jiangdu County, and Hushu in Jiangning County, over 50,000 piglets have been transferred to farmers after the establishment and restoration of livestock markets. Since January, the Yancheng County urban livestock market has seen the listing of over 2,000 head of draught cattle and piglets, with over 1,000 head already traded. These livestock markets are also seeking sources of goods from other areas through existing local purchase and sales relationships. The seven piglet businesses in Xiaji District of Baoying County have re-established contact with twenty-five pig dealers from other areas, supplying over 2,000 piglets to local farmers. After the Yushan Town piglet market in Kunshan County restored its old purchase and sales business with other areas, the source of piglets increased, changing the past situation where there was only a market on market days, and a lively scene of having a market every day has appeared. The urban draught cattle market in this county has adopted the method of sending representatives with agricultural cooperatives to purchase in producing areas, helping ten local agricultural cooperatives purchase more than 50 draught cattle, which is very popular among farmers.

    大力支持农业和副业生产
    江苏省积极组织调剂耕畜、苗猪和苗羊
    新华社南京11日电　江苏省无锡、雎宁、泗阳和江都等二十六个县恢复和建立二百五十多个牲畜市场，广泛地组织牲畜商贩，进行耕畜、苗猪、苗羊的调剂和贩运，支持农业和副业生产。
    据东台县安丰、江都县大桥、江宁县湖熟等十一个集镇统计，在建立和恢复牲畜市场后，已帮助农民调剂了苗猪五万多头。盐城县城区牲畜市场从1月份以来，上市耕牛、苗猪两千多头，已成交了一千多头。这些牲畜市场还通过当地原有的购销关系向外地寻找货源。宝应县夏集区七个苗猪行和外地二十五个猪贩恢复了联系，供应给当地农民两千多头苗猪。昆山县玉山镇苗猪市场恢复与外地的老购销业务后，苗猪货源增加，改变了过去逢集才有市的情况，出现了每天都有市的活跃景象。这个县的城区耕牛市场采取和农业社派代表共赴产区采购的办法，帮助当地十个农业社采购到耕牛五十多头，这种采购办法很受农民欢迎。
