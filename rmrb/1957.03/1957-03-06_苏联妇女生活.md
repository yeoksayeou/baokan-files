    苏联妇女生活
    苏联妇女在生活上受到苏联政府多方面的关怀和照顾。在政治上更享有与男子平等的充分权利。她们不仅积极参加选举，而且很多人被选到各政权机构中。在苏联最高政权机关——苏联最高苏维埃中有三百四十八名妇女代表，约占代表总数的四分之一；被选为各加盟共和国和自治共和国最高苏维埃代表的妇女有两千二百零九人，在地方苏维埃中有五十多万妇女代表。
    在苏联，最光荣的称号就是社会主义劳动英雄称号。苏联妇女有两千三百多人都因自己在劳动战线上的卓越成就而荣获社会主义劳动英雄称号。
    在科学技术方面，苏联妇女也同样贡献出了自己的力量。苏联有一万多名妇女获得了科学上的学位和称号；在苏联各企业、建筑工地和科学研究机构中有四十多万女工程师和女技师，而在农业上40％以上的农学家都是妇女。（附图片）
