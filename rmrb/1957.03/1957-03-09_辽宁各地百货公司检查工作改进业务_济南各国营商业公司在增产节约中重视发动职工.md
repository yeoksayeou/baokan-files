Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Department stores in Shenyang, Jinzhou, Yingkou, Xingcheng, Zhangwu and other cities and counties in Liaoning Province have launched a production increase and thrift movement, starting with a review of various tasks from last year.

The Shenyang Department Store attaches great importance to improving purchasing and sales operations and strengthening ties between industry and commerce in the production increase and thrift movement. They made advance arrangements for commodities that are produced year-round but sold seasonally. Through industry-commerce symposiums, both sides put forward suggestions for improvement, which improved product quality and simplified procedures. When factories and handicraft production cooperatives experienced a shortage of raw materials, the stores also took the initiative to help solve the problem. Employees of the Jinzhou Department Store focused the production increase and thrift movement on actively organizing sources of goods and ensuring market supply. Purchasing agents went deep into factories and handicraft production cooperatives to uncover sources of goods based on market needs, finding many commodities in short supply, such as soap and sacks. In order to understand the needs of the people, salespersons also universally carried out counter visits. The Yingkou Department Store actively unearthed potential materials in inventory. It has now cleared out more than 25,000 pieces of various long-stored men's and women's clothing, children's clothing, and a large number of shoes, hats, pillowcases, etc. from the warehouse. Currently, these commodities are being processed and modified according to consumer preferences. The Zhangwu County Department Store plans to try to ship complete vehicle loads as much as possible this year in order to avoid wasting railway cars. It will also strengthen commodity storage and recycling of old packaging materials, which is expected to save 150,000 yuan for the whole year.

This newspaper reports: The production increase and thrift movement carried out by various state-owned commercial companies in Jinan, Shandong Province, is focusing on improving business management, reducing commodity circulation costs, and streamlining organizations.

The State-owned Textile Company, the Transportation and Telecommunications Equipment Company, and four other units plan to adopt thrift measures such as reducing packaging costs, increasing the loading rate of entire vehicles, increasing storage capacity, strengthening storage management, and shipping goods directly from factories and stations to reduce commodity losses. Preliminary estimates show that the savings for the state in the first quarter will be more than 46,700 yuan. At the same time, each unit has made preliminary calculations and comparisons based on commodity turnover plans and actual labor needs in terms of reorganizing the organization and streamlining administrative personnel, and has put forward opinions on abolishing and merging redundant institutions. Preliminary estimates are that this could reduce personnel by 893 people in 18 units throughout the city, accounting for 15.89% of the current total number of people.

Many units have paid attention to mobilizing and relying on the masses of employees. Therefore, the vast number of employees in these enterprises have actively and enthusiastically participated in the production increase and thrift movement. The Youth League organization of the State-owned Medicinal Materials Company mobilized more than 60 people to form a youth thrift team, who used their holidays to pick out more than 1,000 kinds of useful medicinal materials from chaotic medicinal materials, totaling more than 700 kilograms, worth 280 yuan. The State-owned Textile Company also organized more than 80 employees to go deep into the countryside for visits, which greatly improved the ideological awareness of the employees. Many comrades expressed that they must participate in the production increase and thrift movement with practical actions.

    济南各国营商业公司在增产节约中重视发动职工
    据新华社讯　辽宁省沈阳、锦州、营口、兴城、彰武等市县的百货公司从检查去年各项工作入手，展开了增产节约运动。
    沈阳市百货公司在增产节约运动中非常重视改进购销业务和密切工商关系。他们对常年生产，季节销售的商品，提前作了安排。通过工商座谈会，双方互相提出改进意见，使产品质量有了提高，手续制度简化了。当工厂、手工业生产社发生原材料缺乏时，商店也主动设法帮助解决。锦州市百货公司的职工，以积极组织货源、保证市场供应等为增产节约运动的主要内容，采购员根据市场需要，深入到工厂和手工业生产合作社挖掘货源，找到了供应不足的香皂、麻袋等很多商品。为了摸清人民需要，营业员们还普遍开展了柜台访问工作。营口市百货公司积极挖掘库存潜在物资，现在已经从仓库里清理出各种多年积压的男女服装、儿童服装等二万五千多件，及大批鞋、帽子、枕套等，目前这部分商品正在根据消费者的喜爱进行加工改制。彰武县百货公司计划在今年内，商品运输尽量凑整车发，不浪费车皮，并加强商品保管和回收旧包装材料等，预计全年可节约十五万元。
    本报讯　山东省济南市各国营商业公司开展的增产节约运动，正围绕着改善经营管理，降低商品流转费用，精简机构等几个方面进行。
    国营纺织品公司、交通电讯器材公司等六个单位计划从减少包装费用，提高整车装载率，提高仓储实量和加强保管，就厂就站发货，降低商品损耗等方面采取节约措施。初步草账第一季度即可为国家节约四万六千七百余元。同时，各单位就整编机构，精减行政人员方面，按照商品流转计划和实需劳动力进行草账对比，提出了撤销、合并多余机构的意见，初步估计，全市十八个单位中因此可减少人员八百九十三人，占现有总人数15.89％。
    不少单位注意了发动与依靠职工群众，因此，这些企业的广大职工都积极热情地投入增产节约运动。国营药材公司青年团组织，发动了六十余人组成青年节约队，利用假日在混乱药材中捡出有用药材一千多种，共七百多斤，价值二百八十元。国营纺织品公司并组织八十余个职工，深入农村进行访问，大大提高了职工群众的思想觉悟，不少同志纷纷表示一定要以实际行动投入增产节约运动。
