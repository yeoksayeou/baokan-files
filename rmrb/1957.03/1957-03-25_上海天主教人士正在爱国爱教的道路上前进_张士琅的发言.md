　　Shanghai Catholics are Advancing on the Path of Patriotism and Love of Religion
　　Zhang Shilang's Speech
　　Since the conclusion of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference last year, we, the Catholics in Shanghai, have been greatly inspired by the state's current policy of uniting all possible forces to serve socialist construction. We are also deeply moved by the government's care and respect for us Catholics. Over the past year, in order to meet the needs of our religious life and encourage our patriotic enthusiasm, the government has done more work in implementing religious policies. As a result, our members have improved their understanding of religious policies, their hearts are more eager to be close to the government, and they have made considerable progress in patriotic actions. This is very beneficial to both national construction and our missionary work.
　　At present, the economic situation of our diocese has stabilized, and religious affairs are developing normally. The religious life of Catholics in rural areas and the problem of occupied church properties have been smoothly resolved in many areas through consultations between various parties and the church's proactive attitude. Some of these solutions have not only met the religious needs of peasant Catholics but have also promoted agricultural production and the successful operation of cooperatives. Furthermore, churches that had been in disrepair for many years, as well as the Xujiahui Cathedral, which was damaged in a typhoon last year, have been renovated under the strong support of the government. In the past year, more than 20 senior intellectuals from Shanghai's Catholic community have participated in cultural and educational work, and more than 700 young people have taken up learning and work positions. More than 50 priests and Catholics have been elected as representatives to the municipal and district people's congresses. Priests and Catholics have actively participated in various patriotic activities and patriotic study sessions. Many of those arrested during the anti-rightist movement have shown signs of repentance after government education and have been successively granted lenient treatment. Many of them have been able to exert useful strength for the country. Currently, Catholics in Shanghai are preparing to formally establish a patriotic organization to unite Catholics, further improve patriotic and religious work, and create better conditions. All these gratifying phenomena are a great encouragement to us Catholics and a powerful rebuff to those who attempt to obliterate the facts and carry out distorted propaganda.
　　Of course, in the course of our work, there are inevitably many difficulties and shortcomings. For example, a small number of people in our church still have vague ideas and cannot distinguish between friends and enemies, which affects the unity of the people. Some still do not trust the religious policy very much and are not very active in participating in patriotic work. These issues require us to strengthen unity and enlightenment work in the future, help them in good faith, distinguish the boundaries between politics and religion, and move forward on the path of patriotism and love of religion. However, some non-religious people do not understand our church situation and lack understanding of religious policies, which creates adverse effects. We hope that the government will pay attention to this, such as the phenomenon of discrimination against Catholics in individual units; in some rural areas, legitimate religious activities are also obstructed, making it impossible for Catholics' religious life to recover quickly; some church buildings are still occupied and have not been returned. We hope that the government will do its best to assist in achieving a reasonable solution. As for the handling of Catholics arrested during the anti-rightist movement, we hope that the government will strengthen their education so that they can repent and be released as soon as possible. Doing the above work well is very necessary to protect freedom of religious belief, mobilize the active forces of our Catholics, and participate in national construction.

　　上海天主教人士正在爱国爱教的道路上前进
　　张士琅的发言
    自从去年全国政协会议结束以后，我们上海天主教人士，对于国家当前团结一切可能团结的力量、为社会主义建设服务的方针，得到很大启发，政府对我天主教人士的关怀尊重，也使我们深受感动。一年多来，政府为了满足我们宗教生活的要求，鼓舞我们的爱国热情，在执行宗教政策上，又做了更多工作。因此，我们教内人士，对宗教政策的认识，有了提高，靠拢政府的心，愈加热切，在爱国行动方面，也有不少进步。这对于国家建设和我们的传教事业，都是非常有利的。
    现在我们教区的经济情况，已经稳定，教务在正常开展中，农村里教友的宗教生活和教会房屋的被占用问题，经过各方面协商和教会采取主动积极的态度，好多地区已经顺利解决，有的由于处理恰当，不但满足了农民教友的宗教生活，还对农业增产和办好合作社，起了推动作用。还有年久失修的教堂和去年在风灾中受损的徐家汇大堂，都在政府大力支持下，先后整修一新。去年一年内，上海天主教友，有二十多个高级知识分子，参加文化教育工作，七百多个青年，走上学习和工作岗位，神父教友五十余人，当选为市、区人民代表。各项爱国活动和爱国主义学习，神父教友都积极参加。在肃反运动中的被捕人员，许多人经过政府教育，有了悔改表现，也陆续得到宽大处理，他们中间不少人，已能为国家发挥有用力量。目前，上海天主教友正准备正式成立一个爱国组织，为团结教内人士，进一步作好爱国爱教工作，创造更好条件。这一切可喜现象，对我们天主教人士，确是一个莫大的鼓舞，对那些企图抹煞事实，进行歪曲宣传的人，是一个有力的回击。
    当然在工作开展中，难免不少困难和缺点，像我们教会中，还有少数人，思想模糊，敌我不分，以致影响人民内部的团结；有的对宗教政策还不大信任，参加爱国工作不甚积极。这些都有待于我们今后加强团结开导工作，善意帮助他们，分清政治和宗教的界限，向爱国爱教的道路迈步前进。但是，有些教外人士，由于对我们教会情况了解不够，宗教政策缺少认识而造成的不良影响，也希望政府加以注意，如个别单位还有歧视天主教人士的现象；某些农村地区对于正当的宗教活动，也加以阻挠，致使教友的宗教生活，不能迅速恢复；有些教堂房屋仍被占用，还未归还，希望政府竭力协助，取得合理解决；至于处理肃反运动中被捕的教内人士，希望政府加强教育他们，使他们悔悟自新，早获宽大释放。做好上列工作，对于保护宗教信仰自由，调动我们教内人士积极力量，参加国家建设，都是很必要的。
