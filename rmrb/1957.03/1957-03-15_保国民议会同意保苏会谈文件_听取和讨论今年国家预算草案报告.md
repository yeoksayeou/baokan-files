Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, March 13th: The Bulgarian National Assembly's Seventh Session resumed on the 11th and has held meetings for two days.

    At the meeting on the 11th, Chairman of the Council of Ministers Yugov delivered a report on his visit to the Soviet Union, and Foreign Minister Lukanov reported on his visit to Albania.

    In his report, Yugov discussed the situation of the Bulgarian-Soviet talks, the unity of socialist countries, and Bulgaria's desire to improve relations with its neighbors. He said that the recent exchange of views between the Bulgarian and Turkish governments on issues of common concern gives us reason to believe that expanding mutual cooperation and establishing friendly relations between the two countries is entirely possible. We have also achieved certain good results in our relations with Greece. Yugov hoped that the governments of these two countries would also demonstrate a sincere desire to improve relations with Bulgaria.

    Yugov pointed out that Bulgaria will strive to consolidate relations with Yugoslavia and its people on the basis of mutual respect and non-interference in internal affairs.

    The meeting unanimously approved the activities of the government delegation during the talks in Moscow and the documents signed, and adopted corresponding resolutions on the reports of Yugov and Lukanov, respectively.

    At the meeting on the 12th, Minister of Finance and State Supervision Lazarov delivered a report on the draft state budget for 1957. He pointed out that the total revenue of the 1957 state budget is 18,497 million leva, and the total expenditure is 18,423 million leva. This year's budget expenditure is 1,005.4 million leva more than last year. 56.6% of the total expenditure will be used to further develop the national economy, and 4.4 billion leva will be used as funds for social and cultural measures.

    The defense expenditure stipulated in the budget is 1.5 billion leva, accounting for only 8.3% of the total expenditure (compared to 8.7% last year).

    After Lazarov's report, the meeting launched into discussion.

    据新华社索非亚13日电  保加利亚国民议会第七次会议在11日复会以后，又开了两天的会。
    在11日会议上，部长会议主席于哥夫作了关于访问苏联的报告，外交部长卢卡诺夫就访问阿尔巴尼亚作了报告。
    于哥夫在报告中除了谈到保苏会谈的情况以外，还谈到了社会主义国家的团结问题和保加利亚改善同邻国关系的愿望。他说，最近保加利亚和土耳其两国政府就共同关心的若干问题所进行的意见交换，使我们有理由相信，扩大两国的相互合作和建立友好关系是完全可能的。在我们同希腊的关系中同样也取得了一定的良好成果。于哥夫希望这两个国家的政府也表现出改善同保加利亚关系的真诚愿望。
    于哥夫指出保加利亚将在互相尊重和不干涉内政的基础上尽力巩固同南斯拉夫及其人民之间的关系。
    会议一致同意政府代表团在莫斯科会谈时的活动和所签署的文件，并就于哥夫和卢卡诺夫的报告分别作出相应的决议。
    在12日会议上，财政和国家监察部长拉扎罗夫作了关于1957年国家预算草案的报告。他指出：1957年国家预算的总收入是一百八十四亿九千七百万列弗，总支出是一百八十四亿二千三百万列弗。今年的预算支出比去年增加十亿零五千四百万列弗。总支出的56.6％将用来进一步发展国民经济，将用作社会文化措施的基金有四十四亿列弗。
    预算中规定的国防费用为十五亿列弗，仅占总支出的8.3％（去年占8.7％）。
