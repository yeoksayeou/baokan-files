　　It's Easy to Kill a Tiger, But Hard to Sell It
    In many mountainous areas of Jiangxi, farmers are unable to sell the wild animals they have hunted. For example, farmers who kill a tiger and carry it to the street to sell find that the livestock company only wants the tiger skin, the food company only wants the tiger meat, and the medicinal materials company only wants the tiger bones. However, the farmers only know how to kill tigers, not how to butcher them into separate parts, and these companies each only want one part, so the farmers feel that it is easy to kill a tiger but difficult to sell it.
    Since last winter, the enthusiasm of farmers in many mountainous areas of Jiangxi for capturing wild animals has declined. How can this problem be solved? I hope these three departments will study it.　Yang Sheng (attached picture)

　　打虎容易卖虎难
    江西许多山区农民打到了野兽无法出售。例如农民打到了一只老虎抬到街上去卖，畜产公司只收虎皮，食品公司只要虎肉，药材公司只收虎骨。可是农民只会打虎，不知道分虎，而这些公司又是各要其一，因此农民都感到打虎容易卖虎难。
    从去年冬季以来，江西许多山区农民捕捉野兽的积极性下降了。这个问题怎么解决呢？希望这三个部门研究研究。　杨生（附图片）
