Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The tasks for the national grain and oil work in 1957 were determined at the national conference of grain bureau directors, which closed today. The conference was convened by the Ministry of Food on February 25th in Beijing and lasted a total of fourteen days.

The meeting, after comprehensively analyzing and summarizing the achievements, shortcomings, and lessons learned in grain and oil work in 1956, pointed out that a contradiction still exists between the growth rate of grain and oil production in our country and the growth of people's needs, which is formed by economic construction development, improvement of people's living standards, and high population growth rate. This contradiction cannot be significantly eased in a relatively long period in the future. Therefore, grain and oil purchasing and marketing work must adapt to this characteristic, adhere to frugal consumption while ensuring basic needs. The state's grain and oil revenue and expenditure plans should have a certain amount of surplus in normal years, more surplus in bumper years, and strive for balance even in general disaster years. At the same time, the whole nation and all cadres should be constantly educated to abide by the state's grain supply plan and save grain and oil. It is also necessary to continue to adhere to the principles of the state's unified purchase and sale system, unified arrangement of purchase and sale plans, unified allocation, and unified management of inventory, in order to properly regulate the relationship between grain and oil production and demand and truly ensure the balance between production and needs, and between purchase and sale.

The main tasks of grain work in 1957 are: to further improve the purchase and sale of grain and oil, especially the purchase and sale of grain in rural areas and the unified allocation of grain and oil, to ensure the continued stability of the grain and oil situation; at the same time, it is necessary to actively carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, and effectively improve business management; and to complete the task of handing over profits to the state.

In terms of grain purchase and sale work, the meeting believed that all efforts must be made to increase income and reduce expenditure, and reduce the state's grain revenue and expenditure deficit. Areas where the grain requisition task has not been completed should strive to complete it; areas that have already completed it, especially bumper harvest areas, should strive to purchase more; and strictly control the monthly grain sales plan to ensure reasonable supply. The meeting also requested that residents of cities and towns across the country save an additional half a catty to one catty of grain per person per month on the basis of the consumption standards set by the government; and strengthen the inspection and unified allocation of grain rationing, and improve the efficiency of using stored grain.

In order to enable farmers across the country to understand the state's grain purchase and sale policies this year and encourage them to actively produce, the meeting decided that all localities must clearly explain to farmers before this year's spring plowing that the basis of this year's "three fixings" (fixed output, fixed purchase, and fixed sales) remains unchanged, and that the principle of increasing purchases and reducing sales or reducing purchases and increasing sales should be implemented when the actual output of farmers is higher or lower than the fixed output. In addition, when distributing grain in agricultural cooperatives, the principle of "the state first, then the agricultural cooperative" should be implemented, that is, sufficient food rations, seeds, and feed should be reserved according to the "three fixings" standard, and then the state requisition task should be completed, and the surplus should be rationally distributed.

This year's national oil work also shows an abnormal situation of less purchase and more sales. All localities must continue to vigorously organize purchases, seize the opportunity to put arrears into storage, and take measures such as exchanging soybean cake for soybeans, increasing the oil yield of mechanized and indigenous oil mills, and promoting the production of tofu from cold-pressed soybean cake and oil extraction from rice bran to actively open up oil sources; at the same time, it is also necessary to advocate saving oil, and the supply quotas for urban and rural residents that are too high should be appropriately reduced to ensure the balance of the state's purchase and sale plan and the necessary supply in various regions.

    保证基本需要　坚持节制消费
    进一步做好粮食油脂购销工作
    新华社11日讯　1957年全国粮食和油脂工作的任务，已在今天闭幕的全国粮食厅局长会议上确定。这个会议是粮食部2月25日在北京召开的，历时共十四天。
    会议在全面分析和总结了1956年粮食和油脂工作的成绩、缺点和经验教训后指出，当前我国粮食、油脂生产增长的速度同因经济建设发展、人民生活提高和人口增殖率高而形成的人民需要增长之间，还存在着矛盾，在今后一个较长的时期内不可能大大缓和，因此粮食和油脂的购销工作必须适应这个特点，在保证基本需要的基础上，坚持节制消费。国家的粮食、油脂收支计划，在平常年景应有一定数量的积余，丰年应当积余多一点，一般灾年也要争取平衡。同时还应在全国人民和全体干部中，经常进行遵守国家粮食供应计划和节约粮食油脂的教育；并须继续坚持国家统一购销制度、统一安排收销计划、统一调度、统一管理库存的方针，以妥善地调节粮食、油脂的产需关系，确实保证生产和需要之间、收购和销售之间的平衡。
    1957年粮食工作的主要任务是：进一步做好粮食、油脂的购销工作，特别是农村粮食购销工作和粮食、油脂的统一调度工作，以确保粮食、油脂局势的继续稳定；同时，必须积极开展增产节约运动，切实改善经营管理；完成上缴利润的任务。
    在粮食购销工作方面，会议认为必须尽一切努力，开源节流，缩小国家粮食收支逆差。凡粮食征购任务没有完成的地区，应当力争完成；已经完成的地区，特别是丰收地区，应当力争多购一点；严格掌握粮食月度销售计划，保证合理供应。会议还要求各地市镇居民在政府规定的消费标准的基础上，每人每月再节约半斤到一斤粮食；并加强粮食统销的检查和统一调度工作，提高库存粮食的运用效率。
    为了使全国农民了解今年国家粮食购销工作的政策，鼓励他们积极生产，会议决定各地必须在今年春耕前，向农民明确交代今年粮食“三定”的基础仍然不变和农民实产量比定产量有所增加或减少时实行增购减销或者减购增销的原则，以及在农业合作社分配粮食时应当贯彻“先国家后农业社”的原则，即先按“三定”标准留足口粮、种子、饲料，然后再完成国家征购任务，有余再作合理分配。
    今年国家的油脂工作也出现购少销多的不正常情况，各地必须继续大力组织收购，抓紧尾欠入库，并采取以豆饼换大豆、提高机榨土榨油场的出油率，推广冷榨豆饼制豆腐和米糠榨油等措施，积极开辟油源；同时，还必须提倡节约油脂，城乡居民供应定额偏高的应适当降低，以保证国家购销计划的平衡和各地区的必需供应。
