Dialectically Observing the Agricultural Cooperative Movement
Lü Jiyi Critiques Skepticism about the Superiority of Cooperation Based on Guangxi's Situation

    After listening to Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people at the Eleventh Supreme State Conference, Premier Zhou Enlai's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries at the Third Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC, and Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of some issues regarding the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan, I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support them. Moreover, I believe that in China's socialist transformation and construction, and in the international struggle of socialist and nationalist countries against imperialism and colonialism, these reports are of great significance in helping us to enhance our understanding, distinguish between friend and foe, and differentiate between right and wrong. In particular, Chairman Mao's guidance on how to use dialectical viewpoints and research methods to handle all issues is even more educational for us.

    Chairman Mao talked about the issue of socialist transformation of agriculture. Since I come from Guangxi, I would like to give a brief introduction to the agricultural cooperation situation in Guangxi, and combine it with Chairman Mao's instructions to talk about my shallow understanding of this issue.

      Cooperation Conquered Severe Disasters

    Guangxi, like other provinces, has seen a rapid development of the agricultural cooperative movement since Chairman Mao made his report on the issue of agricultural cooperation. By last spring, the number of farm households participating in advanced agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province reached 98% of the total number of farm households, basically completing the socialist transformation of agriculture. The facts of the past year have fully proven that agricultural cooperation has made tremendous achievements in increasing production and combating natural disasters, demonstrating unparalleled superiority.

    However, in the second half of last year, Guangxi suffered a drought unprecedented in decades, and the newly organized advanced agricultural cooperatives faced this severe test from the start. Due to the impact of the drought, the annual grain production increase plan could not be completed, and some cooperatives (about 20%) reduced production. As a result, the social narrative became, "Advanced cooperatives reduce production, farmers' lives are hard, and cooperation has no superiority." Some people even prematurely concluded that "farmers are clamoring to withdraw from the cooperatives, and the cooperatives are about to collapse."

    These arguments came from various sources: First, the wealthy peasants, most of whom were swept into the cooperative movement by the great storm of cooperation, did not yet have a good understanding of the superiority of cooperation. Of course, their thinking could not be solid. When their personal income did not temporarily increase or decreased compared to the past, they would naturally have a sense of resistance to cooperation, shouting and yelling; second, some grain-deficient farmers did have some difficulties, and it was inevitable that they would have wavering thoughts and express dissatisfaction; and some self-proclaimed "good-hearted" people in society, due to a lack of in-depth understanding of the situation and a comprehensive analysis of the problem, saw some local and individual phenomena, and were influenced by the shouts of rich peasant elements, thus doubting the superiority of cooperation, making a "tragic and compassionate" gesture to complain about the suffering of the farmers.

    Is it true that agricultural cooperation is really as these people understand and shout about, with no superiority? Guangxi's agricultural production situation in 1956 gave a clear answer to this question.

    Due to the basic completion of agricultural cooperation, the farmers' enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high. Last year, the province built water conservancy projects sufficient to irrigate more than 9 million mu of farmland, more than five times the annual average since liberation; fertilizer accumulation increased by more than double that of 1955; and various technological reforms were also universally promoted. Therefore, the first half of last year saw an unprecedented bumper harvest, with grain production increasing by 39.9% compared to the same period in 1955. In the second half of the year, most parts of the province had not had rain for six or seven consecutive months, and the disaster area was more than 1.7 million mu, accounting for about 50% of the province's crop area. In some areas, even drinking water became a problem. Under such severe disasters, thanks to the close leadership of party committees and governments at all levels, relying on the collective strength of the masses of farmers, and vigorously carrying out rescue efforts, the areas with lighter disasters were overcome, and the losses in areas with heavier disasters were also reduced to varying degrees, so that the average grain yield of the province was still better than any bumper harvest year before liberation. Cooperatives with increased production still accounted for 65% of the total number of cooperatives in the province, while cooperatives with reduced production accounted for only about 20%. A particularly prominent example was Ningming County, where all 115 cooperatives in the county increased production, and one Longjin cooperative even increased production by as much as eight times. There is no doubt that if it were not for the impact of the disaster, it would have been entirely possible to complete the task of increasing production by 30% throughout the province.

    These vivid facts educated the broad masses of farmers. It made the farmers deeply realize the great significance of cooperation for increasing production and combating natural disasters. Many farmers reflected in this way: "If it were not for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading us to engage in advanced cooperatives, we really don't know what state the 1956 drought would have left us in!" Really, if cooperation had not been completed, it would have been difficult to imagine overcoming such a serious disaster. Therefore, the vast majority of farmers unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely take the socialist road, to run the cooperatives well, and to strive for a great harvest this year. And those who clamored to withdraw from the cooperatives were only individual households. Not only did none of the 10,320 cooperatives in the province (including 323 elementary cooperatives) collapse, but they were further consolidated and developed after the test.

        Farmers' Lives Have Improved

    With the development of cooperatives, the lives of farmers have also been initially improved. In general areas, about 80% of the members of the cooperative have increased their income, and in some areas, the members of the cooperative who have increased their income have even reached 95%. According to a survey of ten townships, the average net income per member in 1956 increased by 6.49% compared to 1955, and by 30.41% compared to 1953. These are ironclad facts. But some people ignore these facts and shout that "farmers are suffering." Are farmers really suffering? We should not deny that farmers today are generally more bitter than cadres, workers, and urban residents; but we should also not deny that the lives of farmers have greatly improved compared to before liberation. As everyone knows, in the old society, the vast majority of farmers had no land. Under the cruel exploitation of the landlords, they worked hard all year round, could not eat enough, could not keep warm, and when they encountered famine years and unexpected events, they had no choice but to sell their wives and daughters to eke out a living. That was the real suffering of the farmers. Now that era is gone forever. The Communist Party led the farmers to divide the land, organized cooperatives, increased production and income. Farmers generally have enough to eat, enough clothes to keep warm, and their lives have improved. And most of them have implemented the "five guarantees," and the widowed, orphaned, and lonely have been taken care of. In two or three years, the situation will change even more. It will really be like Chairman Mao said, in another two or three years, the farmers will become rich. If it is believed that farmers' lives have not improved, or even are more bitter than in the old society, and that this suffering is brought about by cooperation, this is not in line with the actual situation, and therefore it is wrong.

      Difficulties Cannot Stop the Torrent of Cooperation

    Of course, this is not to say that the cooperative and agricultural production work in our province last year was perfect, with no shortcomings or problems. Because advanced agricultural cooperatives developed too quickly, many tasks could not keep up. Cadres and the masses lacked experience in running cooperatives. In addition, after the completion of the work of merging cooperatives and upgrading them to advanced cooperatives in various places during the spring plowing production season, they immediately invested in production. The season was tight, and the tasks were heavy. Therefore, it was inevitable that there would still be unsound management and some cadres exhibited coercion and commandism. At the same time, due to insufficient understanding of the arduousness of socialist transformation of agriculture, some cadres overemphasized the superiority of socialism, propagating the ideals of the socialist countryside several years later as today's reality, resulting in blind optimism, unrealistically setting high production targets, and competing to call themselves "thousand-catty cooperatives" and "thousand-catty counties." As a result, agricultural work in our province in the first half of last year only focused on grain production, and relaxed the production of cash crops and sideline occupations. At the same time, some agricultural cooperatives did not implement the policy of "running cooperatives diligently and thriftily," resulting in some cooperatives appearing with the situation of "increased production but no increase in income," which brought certain difficulties to the farmers.

    How should we treat these problems? Chairman Mao taught us when talking about socialist transformation of agriculture: The growth of new things always goes through twists and turns and criticism. Moreover, like cooperatives, this unprecedented earth-shattering change, if it is said that it does not need to go through any twists and turns and difficulties, and can succeed smoothly, only subjectivists would have such an idea. So the question is not whether cooperation has shortcomings, but how to treat these shortcomings. First of all, we should realize that these are shortcomings in the process of advancement, and that these shortcomings can be overcome through efforts; secondly, we must be determined to overcome these shortcomings. In fact, we are already doing this, and some shortcomings have been overcome, and some are being overcome. I deeply believe that all the difficulties cannot stop the torrent of cooperation from surging forward.

    Whether a cooperative is run well or not, the cadres will play a decisive role. It is true that in the process of running the cooperative, due to the generally low level of cadres, insufficient experience, incorrect working methods, and the existence of subjectivism and commandism, many shortcomings have indeed been generated in the work, and have caused no small losses to the cooperative movement. However, in dealing with this issue, I believe that according to Chairman Mao's instruction of "do not pour cold water on cadres," we should first affirm the hard work and achievements of the cadres in running the cooperative as the main aspect, and then criticize their shortcomings in work and help them correct their mistakes, so that it is beneficial to educating the cadres and improving the work. However, some people one-sidedly emphasize the deviations of the cadres, believing that the cadres are "a complete mess" and that the poor running of the cooperatives is all the fault of the cadres, etc. This is not in line with the facts and is also unfair. I have no obligation to defend the cooperative cadres, but as far as my personal knowledge extends, I often think that in the vast countryside, if there were no thousands upon thousands of cadres leading this arduous and complex cooperative movement diligently day and night, it would not have been possible to achieve the great achievements of today's development and consolidation of cooperation throughout the country; that is to say, the achievements of today's cooperative movement are inseparable from the active efforts of the cooperative cadres. Whoever denies this is not a Marxist who seeks truth from facts. At the same time, we know that the growth of cadres is to go through a process of cultivation and training; and we should believe that our cadres can accumulate experience and gradually improve in work practice and revolutionary struggle. Therefore, we should only help them correct their shortcomings and improve their work level with great concern, and do the work well; pouring cold water on cadres and adopting an attitude of negating everything or a method of killing them with one blow is wrong and harmful.

    From the issue of how to treat the cooperative movement, we should accept some useful lessons: Whoever does not look at problems from a dialectical viewpoint, a comprehensive viewpoint, and a developmental viewpoint will inevitably commit subjective and one-sided errors as a result. In daily work, because there is a problem with our way of thinking, we often cannot see the whole picture of things, but only see one side of things; we cannot see the essence and mainstream of things, but only see the minor aspects and some individual phenomena; we cannot see the development of things and its laws of development, and often like to treat accidental and temporary phenomena as fixed and unchangeable things; and we have not realized the role of mutual restriction and mutual promotion of contradictions between things. - This is the root cause of why we have unclear and subjective one-sidedness in our treatment of various problems. In addition, not going deep into work, not being good at investigation and research, not grasping the situation enough, and lightly believing in rumors, often replacing concrete analysis with speculation and feelings, has also exacerbated the severity of subjective one-sidedness. If this subjective and one-sided way of thinking is not corrected and replaced with the dialectical materialist way of thinking, then in the future, when we encounter this and that problem, we will waver and be unable to distinguish between right and wrong, and we will even become pessimistic and disappointed when we encounter some difficulties and setbacks, so that we will lose our direction. Constantly making this and that mistake is not only a great hindrance to personal progress, but also very unfavorable to consolidating and expanding the victory of socialism. Therefore, we must strive to study Marxism-Leninism, deeply understand Chairman Mao's instructions, and implement them in our work, in order to observe things and deal with problems with the correct stance, viewpoint, and method, and reduce and avoid errors in action caused by deviations in understanding as much as possible. - Although this is an old saying, it is of particular importance to me personally, and I am willing to encourage myself with it and ask for advice from everyone.

　　辩证地观察农业合作化运动
　　吕集义根据广西情况批判对合作化优越性的怀疑论调
    我听了毛主席在第十一次最高国务会议上关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的报告和周恩来总理在政协全国委员会二届三次会议关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告，以及李富春副总理关于第二个五年计划建议的若干问题的说明，我完全同意和衷心拥护。并且认为，在我国进行社会主义改造和社会主义建设中，在国际上社会主义国家和民族主义国家进行反对帝国主义、殖民主义斗争中，这几个报告对于帮助我们提高认识、分清敌我、明辨是非，有非常重大的意义。特别是毛主席在报告中教导我们应该如何运用辩证观点与调查研究方法来处理一切问题，对于我们的教育意义更大。
    毛主席谈到农业社会主义改造问题，我从广西来，我想把广西农业合作化情况作一简要的介绍，并结合主席的指示谈一谈我对这个问题的粗浅认识。
      合作化战胜了严重灾害
    广西和其他各省一样，自从毛主席作出关于农业合作化问题的报告后，在党和政府的领导下，农业合作化运动发展的速度是较快的：去年春，在全省范围内参加高级农业生产合作社的农户即达总农户98％，基本上完成了农业的社会主义改造。一年来的事实完全证明了农业合作化在增加生产、战胜自然灾害各个方面都已作出巨大的成绩，显示出无比的优越性。
    但是，去年下半年，广西却遭受到几十年所未有的旱灾，刚刚组织起来的高级农业社一开始就接受着这个严重的考验。由于旱灾的影响，年度粮食增产计划完不成，有的社（约20％）减了产，于是社会上就散播着“高级社减产、农民生活苦、合作化没有什么优越性”的论调，甚至有人过早的作出“农民纷纷闹退社、合作社要垮台了”的结论。
    这些论调来自各个方面：首先是富裕农民，他们大多数是被合作化大风暴卷进来的，还没有很好的认识合作化的优越性，当然思想就不可能巩固，当着个人的收入暂时没有增加或者比过去减少时，就很自然的要产生对合作化抵触的情绪，大叫大喊；其次就是有些缺粮的农民的确还存在一些困难，思想上也就难免有所动摇，流露出不满情绪；而社会上却又有一些自命为“好心肠”的人士，由于缺乏深入了解情况和全面分析问题，看见局部的、个别的一些现象，同时受着富农分子叫喊的影响，因而怀疑合作化的优越性，做着“悲天悯人”的姿态来替农民叫苦。
    是不是农业合作化真的像这些人所理解、所叫喊那样没有优越性呢？广西1956年的农业生产情况对于这个问题作了明确的回答。
    由于农业合作化的基本完成，农民生产情绪空前高涨，去年全省兴修了足以灌溉九百多万亩农田的水利，为解放后每年平均数的五倍多；积肥比1955年增加了一倍多；各项技术改革也得到普遍的推行。因此，去年上半年就出现了一个空前丰收的景象，粮食产量比1955年同期增加了39.9％。到了下半年，全省大部分地区连续六、七个月未下过雨，受灾面积一千七百余亩，占全省农作物面积50％左右。有些地区连食水都成了问题。在这样严重灾害的情况下，由于各级党政抓紧领导，依靠农民群众的集体力量，大力抢救，结果灾害较轻的地方得到了克服，灾害较重的地方也在不同程度上减轻了损失，使全省粮食的平均产量仍比解放前任何的丰收年还要好。增产社仍占全省总社数65％，减产社仅占20％左右。其中较为突出的是宁明县，全县一百一十五个合作社，社社增产，有一个龙金社增产竟达八倍之多。毫无疑义，如果不是灾害的影响，完成全省增产30％的任务指标是有完全的可能的。
    这些活生生的事实教育了广大的农民。它使农民深刻体会到合作化对于增加生产、战胜自然灾害的重大意义。很多农民都这样反映：“若不是共产党、毛主席领导我们搞高级合作社，1956年的灾荒真不知要落到什么田地！”真的，如果不是完成合作化，要克服这样严重的灾害是难以设想的。因此，绝大多数农民一致表示坚决走社会主义的道路，一定要把合作社办好，争取今年来个大丰收。而闹退社的只是个别户，全省一万零三百二十个合作社（包括三百二十三个初级社）不但没有一个垮台，而且经过了考验更加巩固和向前发展了。
        农民生活改善了
    随着合作社的发展，农民生活也得到了初步的改善。一般地区约有80％的社员增加了收入，部分地区增加收入的社员有的且达95％。据十个乡的调查，每一社员平均纯收入1956年比1955年增长6.49％，比1953年则增长30.41％。这是铁一般的事实。但有些人却无视这些事实，而大叫其
  “农民苦”。究竟农民是不是苦呢？我们不应否认农民今天比起干部、工人和城市居民来说，一般地还是比较苦的；但我们同样不应否认农民的生活比起解放前已有了很大的改善。大家都知道，在旧社会里，绝大多数的农民是没有土地的，他们在地主残酷剥削之下，终岁勤劳，吃不饱、穿不暖，一遇到凶年和意外的事情就不得不卖妻鬻女，苟延残喘，那才是农民真正的苦。现在这个时代已一去不复返了，共产党领导农民分得了土地，组织了合作社，增加了生产和收入，农民一般地已有饭可吃，有衣足以御寒，生活已有所改善，并且大都实行了“五保”，鳏寡孤独得到了照顾。二、三年后情况当有更大的改变，真的会像毛主席所说再过两三年农民就会富裕起来。假如认为农民生活没有改善，甚至比在旧社会还要苦，且认为这种苦是合作化所带来，这是不符合实际情况的，因而是错误的。
      困难挡不住合作化的洪流
    当然，这并不是说，去年我省的合作化和农业生产工作已是十全十美，没有什么缺点和问题了。由于高级农业社发展得太快，很多工作跟不上，干部和群众都缺乏办社的经验，加以在春耕生产时期各地完成并社、升社工作后，立即投入生产，季节紧迫，任务繁重，因而就不可避免的存在经营管理上还不够健全和在一些干部中出现强迫命令的现象。同时，由于大家对农业社会主义改造的艰巨性认识不足，有些干部过分强调了社会主义优越性的一面，把若干年后社会主义农村的理想当作是今天的现实来宣传，产生了盲目的乐观情绪，脱离实际地提出过高的生产指标，纷纷以千斤社、千斤县相号召，以致我省去年上半年的农业工作只是抓紧了粮食生产，放松了经济作物和副业的生产；同时，有些农业社没有贯彻“勤俭办社”的方针，致使一些社出现了“增产不增收”的情况，也就给农民带来一定的困难。
    我们应该怎样对待这些问题呢？毛主席在讲到农业社会主义改造时教导我们：新生的事物的成长总是经过曲折的、批评的。何况像合作社这个史无前例的翻天复地的巨大变革，若说不要经过什么曲折困难，可以一帆风顺地得到成功，那只是主观主义者才会有这种想法。所以问题不在于合作化有没有缺点，而在于如何对待这些缺点。首先我们应认识到，这是前进中的缺点，而且这些缺点是经过努力就可以克服的；其次就要决心克服这些缺点。事实上我们已经是这样做，有些缺点已得到克服，有些则正在克服中。我深深地相信，一切的困难都挡不住合作化这条洪流汹涌前进。
    合作社办得好与不好，干部将起决定性的作用。诚然，在办社过程中，由于干部一般水平较低，经验不足、工作方法不尽对头、存在着主观主义和强迫命令的作风，工作中的确产生了不少的缺点，也给合作化运动造成不小的损失。可是，对待这个问题，我以为应该根据毛主席“不要向干部泼冷水”的指示精神，首先肯定干部办社的辛勤劳动和成绩是主要的方面，然后批判他们工作上的缺点，帮助他们改正错误，这样对于教育干部、改进工作才有好处。但是，有一些人却片面地强调干部的偏差，认为干部“一团糟”，合作社办坏都是干部不好等等，这是不符事实的，也是不公平的。我没有替合作社干部辩护的义务，但凭我个人认识所及，常常在想，在广大农村里，如果没有千千万万的干部在夜以继日的勤勤恳恳的领导这个艰巨复杂的合作化运动，要取得今天全国合作化的发展和巩固的伟大成绩是不可能的；也就是说，今天合作化运动的成绩是与社干的积极努力分不开的。谁要否认这点，那就不是一个实事求是的马克思主义者。同时，我们知道，干部的成长是要经过一个培养锻炼的过程的；而且应该相信，我们的干部是可以在工作实践和革命斗争中积累经验逐步得到提高的。因此，我们只应以十分关切的心情去帮助他们改正缺点、提高工作水平，把工作做好；向干部泼冷水，采取否定一切的态度或者一棒子打死的方法都是不对的、有害的。
    从对待合作化运动这个问题上，我们应接受一些有益的教训：凡是不从辩证观点、全面观点和发展观点来看问题的，其结果必然会犯主观片面的错误。在日常工作中，因为我们思想方法有问题，常常看不到事物的全面，只是看到事物的一面；看不到事物的本质和主流，只是看到事物的次要方面和一些个别的现象；看不到事物的发展和它的发展规律，常爱把偶然的暂时的现象当作固定不移的东西来看待；而且没有认识到事物之间的矛盾的相互制约、相互推动的作用。——这就是所以造成我们对待各种问题认识不清、主观片面的根源。加以不深入工作，不善于调查研究，掌握情况不够，轻信传说，往往以臆测感想代替具体分析，也就助长了主观片面的严重性。这种主观片面的思想方法若不把它改正过来，而代之以辩证唯物主义的思想方法，那么，今后在碰到这样那样的问题时，我们就会摇摆不定，是非不分，遇到一些困难挫折还会悲观失望起来，以致迷失方向。经常犯着这样那样的错误，这不仅对于个人的进步有很大的妨碍，就是对于巩固和扩大社会主义的胜利也是非常不利的。因此，我们必须努力的学习马克思列宁主义，深入的体会毛主席的指示，把它贯彻到工作中去，以正确的立场、观点、方法来观察事物和处理问题，尽可能地减少和避免由于认识上的偏差而造成行动上的错误。——这虽是老生常谈，但对我个人来说却有特别重要的意义，愿以此自勉，并向大家请教。（附图片）
