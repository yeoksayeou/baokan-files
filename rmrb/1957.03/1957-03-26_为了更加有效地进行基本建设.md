　　To Conduct Basic Construction More Effectively
　　By our reporter Chen Jun
　　*Editor's Note:* How to unify leadership and rationally organize and utilize basic construction forces in basic construction is a complex and important issue worthy of careful study. Although this issue involves a wide range of areas, a solution must be found. The opinions reflected in this article are from a symposium convened by the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee on March 12. They unanimously hope to transform the basic construction teams currently led by various central industrial departments into unified construction teams organized by region, under the leadership of the local Party committee, for unified arrangement. They believe that this can overcome many of the existing chaos and waste phenomena. This opinion is worthy of attention.

    To rationally organize and use basic construction teams and conduct basic construction more effectively is the unanimous wish and requirement of all comrades in Taiyuan City who are involved in leading the construction of new factories. They studied and raised this issue at a symposium convened by the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee on March 12.

    Currently, there are eight ministries constructing new factories in Taiyuan City, including the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, and the Ministry of Electric Power Industry. Those responsible for constructing these new factory projects include the Taiyuan Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Metallurgical Construction Company of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Chemical Construction Company of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, as well as construction units under the Ministry of Electric Power Industry and provincial and municipal construction units engaged in urban construction. In addition, new factory construction units (units contracting out projects) have also established large-scale preparatory organizations to supervise basic construction.

    Due to the complexity of engineering technology, the construction companies of the central ministries have gradually divided into many specialized companies (such as machine installation, electrical installation, pipeline installation, furnace construction companies, etc.) from the initial general company. These specialized companies are directly under the leadership of the specialized bureaus of the central ministries. Each new factory is contracted by a construction company, called the general contractor, which is responsible to the client for the construction of the entire project. The general contractor then subcontracts specialized engineering to various specialized companies. For example, a construction project contracted by the Taiyuan Engineering Bureau has ten subcontracting units.

    The above two situations indicate that in the same Taiyuan City, in the same industrial area, there are different client (Party A) and contractor (Party B) relationships, and there are general contractor and subcontractor relationships. What increases this complexity is that all these units are directly led by various central industrial ministries and their specialized bureaus. Thus, in Taiyuan, if any work-related issues arise between any two parties on a construction site, and cannot be resolved, they must be reported to Beijing for instructions, or people must be sent to Beijing to resolve them. However, the superiors of these relevant parties sometimes belong to the same industrial ministry, and sometimes they do not. When problems involving relationships between two ministries are encountered, they often involve various systems that cannot be resolved by the ministries themselves. Therefore, such lawsuits must be filed with the State Planning Commission, the State Economic Commission, the State Construction Commission, or the Ministry of Finance. However, are all these issues raised to Beijing for resolution major and principled issues such as engineering plans and designs? No, many of them are small, specific issues. For example, for some new factories, money is available for the construction of dedicated railway lines, but who should construct them? These issues are often delayed for a long time without resolution, not only hindering the progress of the entire project, but also causing unexpected losses. Two years ago, such an accident occurred: which party should be responsible for the flood control project of a factory? The relevant units argued for several months without resolution. When the rainy season arrived, a flood suddenly came, washing away equipment and even some workers, causing significant losses. Was this flood control project problem difficult to solve? No, after the accident, the painful lesson prompted the factory to quickly resolve the issue. Unfortunately, many similar problems, even the flood control project problem of another factory, are still being debated for a long time without resolution.

    The above situations raise four main issues in the current basic construction work: 1. The leadership of construction and installation enterprises; 2. The relationship between general contractors and subcontractors of construction and installation enterprises; 3. The scope of division of labor between Party A and Party B; 4. The relationship between urban construction and industrial construction.

    At this symposium, the unified leadership of construction and installation enterprises was the most concentrated reflection. Due to the lack of unified leadership of construction and installation enterprises, various waste of manpower, materials, and financial resources has been caused. One prominent example is that each construction unit, although in Taiyuan, must build its own construction base and engage in the same set of auxiliary factories, such as timber processing plants, concrete processing plants, metal structure processing plants, etc., dispersing funds and wasting funds. The metal processing plant of the Taiyuan Engineering Bureau is preparing to move away because it has completed its tasks. However, the Metallurgical Construction Company is building a similar metal processing plant. When the Metallurgical Construction Company first came to Taiyuan, the municipal Party committee suggested using the existing auxiliary factories of the Taiyuan Engineering Bureau, and there was no need to start another set. This is certainly a good suggestion, and as the person in charge of the Metallurgical Construction Company said, it should be done from the perspective of "overall concept." However, later, another set was still started. Why? The Metallurgical Construction Company proposed that these auxiliary factories should be led by a management committee organized by various parties. Otherwise, once the projects of both the Taiyuan Engineering Bureau and the Metallurgical Construction Company need to be rushed, the auxiliary factories of the Taiyuan Engineering Bureau will inevitably rush their own projects and abandon the projects of the Metallurgical Construction Company. Because the issue of unified leadership could not be resolved, the good suggestion of the municipal Party committee could not be realized. At the symposium, some comrades pointed out that according to the construction situation in Taiyuan City, if the issue of unified leadership can be resolved, funds can be concentrated to build a very suitable set of auxiliary factories, which can not only guarantee the needs of all construction units, but also greatly save investment.

    Under the situation of each unit doing its own thing, materials and mechanical equipment of various construction units cannot be shared. Last year, the situation of construction materials was tight. However, not all units were equally tight. Different materials, different units, some had too much, some had too little. If they can be uniformly allocated in the same area, many problems of work stoppage waiting for materials can be solved. For example, the Taiyuan Electric Power Construction Company was short of 700 to 800 tons of steel at that time, while the Taiyuan Engineering Bureau and the Metallurgical Construction Company had stock. However, according to current regulations, the lower-level units have no right to share materials, and the approval of the ministry in Beijing is required for the allocation of materials.

    There is also waste in the aspect of construction machinery. Each construction unit must purchase large-scale machinery and trucks. Each has its own set, and the utilization rate is relatively low.

    This situation has also caused the mobility of the construction teams. When a project is completed, the contracting construction company is transferred to a new area, and thousands of workers have to move with it. Therefore, this strange phenomenon inevitably occurs: when half of the workers of the Taiyuan Engineering Bureau are idled, another construction company is bringing in a large number of workers from other places. There is also a company transferring a certain type of worker from Taiyuan to place A thousands of miles away, while at the same time, another company in place A is transferring the same type of worker to Taiyuan. Accompanying this large-scale transfer is a series of problems: the original dormitories and welfare facilities have to be moved, and those that cannot be moved can only be discarded; when workers move, their families have to go with them, moving expenses have to be paid, and a lot of ideological work needs to be done; for workers, they originally accumulated experience in winter construction in the north, but when they move to the south, they have to learn the skills of rainy season construction.

    Years of experience and lessons have educated people. Whether it was the factory director of Party A, the manager of the construction company of Party B, or the units belonging to the same ministry of Party A and Party B, or the comrades of the Party committee, from their different perspectives, they all believed that this situation cannot continue. Can this situation be changed? These comrades who directly lead basic construction believe that it can be changed. They unanimously hope to transform the basic construction teams currently led by various central industrial ministries into unified construction teams organized by region (except for the railway line construction of the Ministry of Railways and the mine construction of the Ministry of Coal Industry). For example, the establishment of a Construction and Installation Engineering Administration Bureau in Taiyuan, which generally contracts the construction tasks of the central ministries in Shanxi Province. It is led by a central ministry, and the Party work is led by the local Party committee.

    Undeniably, the current method of various central industrial ministries organizing and developing their own basic construction teams has played a positive and significant role in the past few years. After the first four years of the First Five-Year Plan, it changed the situation that China's basic construction teams were very small and weak, and cultivated and trained a million-strong construction army capable of undertaking modern and technically complex engineering construction. If it were not for the simultaneous action of various ministries, the basic construction teams could never have developed so large and so quickly. However, as the scale of China's industrial construction becomes larger and larger, the leadership experience becomes richer and richer, and the technical level of various construction teams generally improves, the situation has changed. In the past, each ministry was worried about whether its own projects could be completed on schedule if they were handed over to other construction units for construction. Now, experience has shown that all projects, as long as there are no problems with drawings and material supply, can be completed ahead of schedule or on schedule. In the past, everyone had no experience and emphasized the particularity of their own construction projects, with special precision requirements in technology, requiring their own specialized technical teams. Now, a strong construction team has been cultivated from various departments and the construction of different projects, with considerable specialized strengths. Therefore, if the basic construction forces can be unified according to region and unified arrangements can be made under the leadership of the local Party committee, many current chaos and waste phenomena can be overcome. It is possible to stabilize construction and installation enterprises in an area according to construction needs, and avoid unreasonable transfers in and out; it is possible to rationally use construction bases and welfare facilities and save investment; it is possible to break the departmental boundaries of mutual cooperation, uniformly adjust and rationally use labor, machinery, equipment, transportation tools, and raw materials, and overcome uneven busy and idle periods, backlog, panic buying, and unreasonable transportation.

    As for the installation engineering of production equipment, most comrades still believe that the specialized forces controlled by the central ministries should be used for construction. Because having the central ministries responsible for the installation of production equipment can first make the responsibility clearer. The contracting construction unit (Party B) is responsible for ensuring that the project is completed on schedule in accordance with the national plan, and the unit preparing to build a new factory (Party A) is responsible for the installation engineering of production equipment and put it into production smoothly after completion. Secondly, for the engineering bureaus of the Ministry of Construction Engineering in various places, it is not necessary to include all special types of work. The workload of these special types of work is often relatively small and concentrated. If the regional construction units have these special types of work, they will often have no work to do; without them, it will not work. However, the central industrial ministries, with these construction teams of special types of work, can use them flexibly according to the needs of various places. However, when this part of the workers is transferred to a certain area, they should accept the unified command of the unit responsible for construction in the area.

    As for the other three issues, the symposium also proposed to strengthen the unified command of general contractors and subcontractors. Professional construction forces most closely related to civil construction, such as water supply and drainage, heating, electricity, and sanitary installation teams, can be assigned to the contracting civil construction company. Highly specialized pipeline companies and large-scale mechanical construction forces can be considered to be assigned to the direct leadership of the regional engineering management bureau, and the specialized bureaus of the central ministries can conduct technical and business guidance. It is hoped that the scope of authority of Party B can be appropriately expanded, and Party A can concentrate on doing a good job in design, equipment supply, and production preparation.

    Of course, the problems mentioned above involve many aspects and are related to the national system. Once raised, they will cause many disputes. However, judging from the current situation, the current practice has exposed many unreasonable aspects and must be improved, which is certain. Therefore, in order to solve this problem, absorb the opinions of all comrades who have directly participated in leading basic construction in the past few years, pool wisdom and brainstorm, jointly study, and strive to organize the strength of our basic construction teams more rationally, and give full play to the strength of national investment and existing basic construction teams, which is of positive significance for welcoming the more arduous industrial construction tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan.

　　为了更加有效地进行基本建设
　　本报记者　陈浚
    编者按　在基本建设中，如何统一领导，合理地组织和使用基本建设的力量，是一个值得注意研究的复杂的重要问题。这个问题虽然涉及的范围很广，但是必须寻找一条解决的途径。这篇文章所反映的意见，是山西省委3月12日所召集的一次座谈会上的意见。他们一致希望把现在分别由中央各工业部门领导的基本建设队伍，改为以地区为单位，组成统一的建筑队伍，在当地党委领导下，进行统一安排；他们认为，这样可以克服现在存在的许多混乱和浪费现象，这个意见是值得重视的。
    合理地组织和使用基本建设的队伍，更加有效地来进行基本建设，这是在太原市所有参加领导建设新厂工作的同志一致的愿望和要求。他们在3月12日山西省委召开的一次座谈会上，研究和提出了这个问题。
    现在在太原市建设新厂的，有第一机械工业部、冶金工业部、轻工业部、化学工业部、电力工业部等八个部。负责建筑这些新厂工程的，有属于建筑工程部的太原工程局、冶金工业部的冶金建筑公司、化学工业部的化学建筑公司，还有电力工业部所属的施工单位和进行城市建设的省、市建筑单位。另外，筹建新厂建设单位（发包工程的单位），还成立有庞大的筹建组织，对基本建设进行监督。
    由于工程技术上的复杂性，中央各部的建筑公司，由最初的一个总公司，逐渐分出许多专业公司（如机器安装、电气安装、管道安装、筑炉公司，等等），这些专业公司，直属中央各部专业局的领导。每个新厂，都由一个建筑公司承包，叫做总包，对甲方负责全部工程的建设任务。再由总包的公司把专业性的工程，分包给各个专业公司。如太原工程局总包的一项建设项目，分包单位就有十个。
    上面两种情况，表明了在同一个太原市，在同一个工区里，有着不同的发包（甲方）单位和承包（乙方）单位的关系，有着总包单位和分包单位的关系，而增加这种复杂性的，还在于所有这些单位，又都是由中央各个工业部和各部的专业局所直接领导的。这样，在太原，在一个工地上任何双方发生了工作上的问题，解决不了，就得向北京请示，或者派人到北京去解决。可是，这些有关方面的上级，有的是属于同一个工业部领导的，有的却是不属于同一个部的。而碰到两个部之间的关系问题，往往又牵涉到各种各样的制度，非各部有权解决的。于是，这样的官司，就要打到国家计划委员会、国家经济委员会、国家建设委员会或者财政部那里。然而，这些提到北京去要求解决的问题，是不是都属于工程的方案、设计等重大的和原则性的问题呢？不是的，其中许多是小的、具体的问题。比如有的新厂，为了修筑专用线，钱是有了，但是由哪方面来修建呢？这些问题，往往拖延很久解决不了，不但妨碍着整个工程的进行，并且还会造成意外的损失。前两年，曾经发生过这样一件事故：一个工厂的防洪工程，究竟归哪方面来修，有关单位争执几个月，没有解决；到了雨季，洪水突然来了，冲走了器材，还冲走了一些工人，造成了重大的损失。这个防洪工程问题，是不是很难解决的呢？不，在出了事故之后，惨痛的教训，推动了这个工厂迅速地解决了这一个问题。可惜有许多类似的问题，甚至另一个工厂的防洪工程问题，仍然争执很久得不到解决。
    上面这些情况，提出了当前基本建设工作中的四个主要问题：一、关于建筑、安装企业的领导问题；二、建筑、安装企业的总包和分包的关系问题；三、甲方和乙方的分工范围问题；四、城市建设和工业建设的关系问题。
    这次座谈会上，比较集中地反映了关于建筑、安装企业的统一领导问题。由于建筑、安装企业领导的不统一，曾经造成了人力、物力、财力的种种浪费。其中，突出的一个，是每个施工单位，虽则同在太原，却都要建设自己的施工基地，各搞同样的一套辅助工厂，像木材加工厂、混凝土加工厂、金属结构加工厂，等等。分散了资金，浪费了资金。太原工程局的金属加工厂，由于完成了任务，准备搬走。可是，冶金建筑公司正在修建一个同样的金属加工厂。当冶金建筑公司初来到太原的时候，市委曾建议利用已有的太原工程局的辅助工厂，不必另搞一套。这当然是个好建议，正像冶金建筑公司负责人所说的，从“整体观念”出发，应当这样做。可是，以后还是另搞一套了。为什么呢？冶金建筑公司方面，提出对于这些辅助工厂，要由各个方面组织管理委员会来领导；否则，一旦到了太原工程局和冶金建筑公司双方的工程都要突击的时候，太原工程局的辅助工厂就难免不去突击自己的工程，抛下冶金建筑公司的工程。由于统一领导的问题解决不了，于是市委的好建议也就实现不了。座谈会上，有的同志提出，按照太原市的施工情况，如果能够解决统一领导的问题，可以集中资金，搞一套很适用的辅助工厂，不但可以保证所有施工单位的需要，并且可以大大节省投资。
    在各搞一套的情况下，各个施工单位的材料和机械设备等方面，不能互通有无。去年建筑材料的情况，是紧张的。但是，并不是所有的单位都同样紧张。各种材料，各个单位，有的多，有的少。如果在同一地区，可以统一调配，能够解决许多停工待料的问题。比如，太原电力建筑公司，当时缺少七、八百吨钢材，而太原工程局和冶金建筑公司却都有存货。但是，按照现行规定，下面的单位无权互通有无，要调拨材料，必须经过北京的部里批准。
    在建筑机械方面，也同样存在着浪费现象。每个施工单位，都要购置大型的机械，载重汽车。各有一套，利用率都比较低。
    这种情况，还造成了建筑队伍的流动性。一个工程竣工了，承包的建筑公司调到新的地区去了，于是，成千的工人就得跟着搬家。因而，也就难免发生这种怪现象：在太原工程局的工人要有一半窝工的时候，另一个建筑公司却正在从外地调来大批工人。也有一个公司正从太原把某一种的工人调到几千里以外的甲地去，同时，在甲地另一个公司却正在把同类的工人，调到太原来。随着这种大调动而来的，发生了一系列的问题：原来的宿舍、福利设施要搬家，搬不动的，只能废弃；工人搬家，还有家属要一起走，要发搬家费，并且需要进行许多思想工作；对于工人来说，原先在北方积累了冬季施工的经验，搬到了南方，就得另学雨季施工的本领。
    几年来的经验教训，教育了人们。在这一次座谈会上发言的，无论是甲方的厂长，乙方的建筑公司的经理或甲乙双方属于一个部的单位，或者党委的同志，从自己不同的角度，都认为不能让这种情况继续下去了。这种状况能不能改变呢？这些直接领导基本建设的同志们认为是能够改变的。他们一致希望把现在分别由中央各个工业部领导的基本建设队伍，改以地区为单位，组成统一的建筑队伍（除了铁道部的线路建设和煤炭部的矿井建设）。比如在太原成立建筑、安装工程管理局，总包中央各部在山西境内的建设任务。归中央的一个部领导，党的工作由地方党委负责领导。
    不可否认的，现在的办法，由中央各个工业部自己组织和发展基本建设的队伍，在过去几年里，发挥了积极的巨大的作用。经过第一个五年计划的前四年，改变了我国基本建设队伍很小很弱的状况，培养和锻炼出了百万建筑大军，能够担当现代化和技术十分复杂的工程建设。要不是各部一齐动手，基本建设的队伍，绝不可能有这么大这么快的发展。但是，当我国的工业建设的规模越来越大，领导经验越来越丰富，各个建筑队伍的技术水平普遍提高以后，情况就变了。过去，每个部都担心自己的工程交给别的建筑单位施工能不能如期竣工；现在，经验已经表明，所有的工程，只要没有图纸和材料供应问题，绝大部分，都是能够按照计划要求，提前和如期竣工的。过去，大家没有经验，都强调自己所建工程的特殊性，在技术上有特殊的精密要求，需要有自己的专门技术队伍；现在，从各种不同的部门和建设不同的工程里，已经培养出来一支强大的建筑队伍；有了相当的特殊性的专业力量。因之，如果能按地区统一基本建设的力量，并在当地党委领导下，进行统一安排，就能够克服现在的许多混乱和浪费现象。可以根据建设需要，把建筑、安装企业在一个地区内稳定下来，避免不合理的调出调入；可以合理使用建筑基地和福利设施，节省投资；可以打破相互协作间的本位界限，统一调剂和合理使用劳动力、机械、设备、运输工具、原材料，克服忙闲不均、积压、抢购和不合理的调运。
    至于生产设备的安装工程，多数同志仍认为由中央各部掌握的专业力量来施工。因为由中央各部负责安装生产设备，首先在责任上可以更加分明。承包的施工单位（乙方）负责保证工程按照国家计划如期完工，筹建新厂的单位（甲方）负责生产设备的安装工程，并在竣工之后，顺利投入生产。其次，对于建筑工程部各地的工程局来讲，可以不必包罗所有的特殊工种，这些特殊工种的工作量，往往是比较小和集中的，地区的施工单位，有了这些特殊工种，会经常没工做；缺了，又不行。而中央各个工业部，有了这些特殊工种的建筑队伍，却可以按照各地的需要，机动使用。不过，当这部分工人，调到某一个地区以后，就应当接受当地负责施工的单位的统一指挥。
    至于在其他三个问题上，座谈会上也提出希望加强总包和分包单位的统一指挥。同土建施工联系最多的专业施工力量，如上下水道、暖气、电气、卫生安装队，可以划归承包的土建公司。专业性较大的管道公司，大型机械施工力量，可以考虑划归地区工程管理局直接领导，中央各部的专业局可以进行技术业务指导。希望适当扩大乙方的职权范围，甲方集中精力做好设计、设备的供应和生产准备工作。
    当然，上面说的这问题，由于牵涉到很多方面，关连到国家的体制，一提出来，就会引起许多争论。不过，就目前状况来看，现在的做法，已经暴露出许多不合理的地方，必须有所改进，是肯定的。因之，为了求得这个问题的解决，吸收几年来所有直接参加领导基本建设工作的同志们的意见，集思广益，共同研究，求得把我们基本建设队伍的力量组织得更加合理，充分发挥国家投资和现有的基本建设队伍的力量，对于迎接第二个五年计划更加繁重的工业建设任务，是有积极意义的。
