	Brahms Anecdotes I
    In 1853, Brahms [1] spent Christmas with his parents in Hamburg. It was a fruitful year for him, as he had found a publisher to print his works. However, his father was experiencing financial difficulties, creating a somber atmosphere at home. As Brahms was leaving, he said to his father, "In times of distress, music is always our best comforter. Just carefully peruse the score of 'Messiah' [2], Papa! It will surely bring you comfort." The father followed his advice and found banknotes tucked between the pages of the Handel's "Messiah" score left by his son, which was the best comfort in his current situation. This was the first money his son had earned himself, and the amount left accounted for more than half of the total.

    Brahms was very close to Johann Strauss [3], often visiting his home. They both respected each other's distinct genius. The Waltz King's wife once asked Brahms to write an inscription in her souvenir album during one of his visits. Brahms wrote the first phrase of the waltz "The Blue Danube," and then inscribed below: "Unfortunately not by me, Johannes Brahms."

    布拉姆斯轶事	一
    1853年，布拉姆斯〔一〕在汉堡与父母共度圣诞节。这一年他大有收获，因为他找到了一位出版商印行他的作品。由于父亲在金钱上感到困难，家里空气十分沉闷。布拉姆斯临别时对父亲说：“在任何苦恼的时刻，音乐总是我们的最好的安慰者。您只消细心翻阅一下‘弥赛亚’〔二〕乐谱就行啦，爸爸！它一定会给您带来安慰的。”父亲照着这个建议做了，却在儿子留下的那本韩德尔所写的“弥赛亚”乐谱各页之间发现了不少钞票，在他当时的境况下这真是最好的安慰。这是他儿子第一次自己赚来的钱，留下的数目占总数一半以上。	二
    布拉姆斯跟约翰·司特劳斯〔三〕非常要好，时时上他家作客，他们两人对于彼此绝异的天才互相敬重。华尔兹舞曲作者的太太有一次趁布拉姆斯来作客时求他在她的纪念册上写一段题词。布拉姆斯写下了华尔兹舞曲“蓝色的多瑙河”的第一段，然后在底下题道：“可惜不是我作的，约翰奈斯·布拉姆斯。”
