    After Seeing "Mother"
    Lin Liu
    The movie "Mother" was showing its final scenes: fireworks bursting, whistles blowing, crowds cheering, the heroic warrior - the mother - excitedly gazing at her factory, looking around at her comrades. The joyous atmosphere on the screen infected the audience, causing our previously tense mood to disappear, turning into excitement and activity. The Long March has already completed its first step, and ahead lies new struggles and a new life.
    "Mother" sings the praises of the kindness, goodness, bravery and diligence of China's working women, shaping the image of a revolutionary mother. As we are working hard for the cause of socialist construction, as we are walking a path more complex and arduous than the one our mother walked back then, understanding how the mother selflessly dedicated all her efforts to the Party and the people, understanding how our elders bravely crossed the previous stage of the revolution, will provide us with many insights and great educational significance.
    The mother's life was one of hardship, but also of glory. When we first saw her on the screen, she was in a very difficult situation. The countryside was bankrupt. All around was a vast expanse of water, withered trees and dilapidated walls. The mother's family had to leave their native land, holding onto faint hope, and flee to the city as refugees. On the way, the mother saw an abandoned little girl. The child's crying touched the mother's heart. She kissed the little girl with tears in her eyes and then put her down again. What could she do? In this situation, did she have the strength to support this little life? The child cried again, the mother walked past and then turned back, finally resolutely taking the child in. Thus, a family of four became a family of five, and the burden on the mother's shoulders became even heavier! From this, don't we fully see the mother's noble love and appreciate her determination and courage to fight life?
    At this time, although the mother was only struggling for the life of her family and was not yet a conscious revolutionary fighter, class feelings were already budding in her heart. She began to sympathize with the revolution and engage in activities to protect revolutionary comrades. She loved and cared for underground Party workers such as Deng Fei and Wang Laode. She shared their worries and rejoiced in their success. When they held meetings, she kept watch for them; when they had no food to eat, she gave them the only two sweet potatoes that were saved for the children. Even after her husband was burned to death by molten iron, when Deng Fei went to see her, she suppressed her grief and asked him caringly if he had eaten. What a broad mind this is! This is a true portrait of our working-class mother!
    The death of her husband gave the mother a heavy blow. Difficulties increased. When she fearfully felt that "the road ahead is too narrow," the Party educated her and supported her, enabling her to see the light from the darkness, making her realize that her husband had died too weakly and that she must never be like him. She resolutely joined the revolutionary ranks and quickly raised her class consciousness, gradually growing from an ordinary working woman into a conscious revolutionary fighter. Although the practical difficulties facing her became more and more numerous and heavier, the road in her mind became wider and brighter. The mother became even stronger. We see how fearlessly she took on the burden of life! She raised her children, endured hunger and suffering; she endured the pain of the sacrifice of her comrade Deng Fei and the imprisonment of her eldest son Chengwen, and continued to persevere in her work. She was arrested and imprisoned twice, suffering the enemy's cruel torture, but her steadfast will was not diminished in the slightest. Even in prison, she used every opportunity to propagate revolutionary principles to the prisoners and persisted in working for the Party. The petrel that flies into the storm is the master of the ocean; the warrior who advances in the face of difficulties is the master of the world! The mother was precisely fighting unyieldingly and achieving victory in the face of one difficulty and test after another. The mother's more than twenty years of struggle not only reflects the process of the revolutionary forces growing from small to large and from weak to strong, but also makes us deeply realize that victory is not easily obtained, but is the result of the hard struggle of the revolutionary pioneers!
    The lofty ideal of communism is the driving force for the mother to overcome numerous difficulties. We still remember the scene when she took the oath of joining the Party. The weak light illuminated the dilapidated hut; the mother's firm, low voice shook the surrounding air: "Whatever the Party wants me to do, I will do it! My head can be broken, but my will cannot be changed!" The mother realized that realizing communism is the most sublime revolutionary ideal. This ideal, blossoming and sprouting in the mother's heart, grew into an invincible material force, giving her the courage to overcome all kinds of difficulties, because she knew that the suffering she endures today will win a happy tomorrow for millions of working people.
    Under the leadership of the Party, not fearing difficulties and struggling hard is the road the mother has taken, and it is precisely the revolutionary tradition that our younger generation needs to learn and inherit. We must draw spiritual strength from the mother's thoughts and struggles and bravely shoulder the responsibility of building socialism.
    Undoubtedly, the film "Mother" will teach our younger generation many beneficial things. It is a pity that the film's artistic appeal is not strong enough, and the mother has not stood before us with the inspiring power she should have. Although the historical background reflected in "Mother" is very grand, the plot is more scattered and not concentrated enough; the mother's growth process has also been cut short. Not only is the road she takes from a working woman who sympathizes with the revolution to a conscious fighter a little short, but her further development of thought after joining the revolution also seems simpler. In the long history of revolutionary struggle, the growth process of the characters' consciousness is relatively vague, which may be the shortcoming of the film!

### “母亲”观后

    “母亲”观后
    林流
    电影“母亲”放映到了最后的几个镜头：礼花喷射，汽笛鸣叫，人群欢跃，英勇的战士——母亲兴奋地凝视着自己的工厂，环顾着自己的同志。银幕上的欢乐气氛传染给了观众，使我们原来的紧张的心情消失了，转为兴奋活跃。万里长征已经走完了第一步，前面已经是新的斗争和新的生活。
    “母亲”歌颂了我国劳动妇女的慈祥善良、勇敢刻苦的美德，塑造了一个革命母亲的形象。当我们正为社会主义建设事业紧张地劳动着，当我们走着比母亲当年所走过的更为复杂、艰巨的道路的时候，了解母亲如何无保留地把自己的全部心力献给党和人民的光荣业绩，了解我们的长辈如何勇敢地跨过前一段革命路程，对于我们来说是会有很多启示和很大的教育意义的。
    母亲的一生是苦难的，也是光荣的。当我们在银幕上第一次看见她的时候，她就处在十分困难的境况之中。农村破产了。四面是汪洋大水，枯树颓垣。母亲一家人不得不离开土生土长的家乡，抱着渺茫的希望，逃荒到城里去。途中，母亲看到了一个被遗弃的小姑娘。孩子的哭声打动了母亲的心，她流着眼泪亲了亲小姑娘又把她放下来。有什么办法呢，在这种时候，她还有力量来养活这个小生命吗？孩子又哭了，母亲走过去了又折回身来，终于毅然地把孩子收养下来。于是四口之家变成了五口之家，母亲肩上的担子也更重了！从这里，我们不就充分地看到了母亲的崇高的爱心，体会到她敢于向生活战斗的决心和勇气吗？
    这时候，虽然母亲还只是为了一家人的生活苦斗着，还不是一个自觉的革命战士，但是阶级情感已经在她心里萌发着，她开始同情革命并且从事于掩护革命同志的活动。她是那样爱戴和关心党的地下工作者邓非、王老德等人。她为他们分担忧虑，为他们的成功喜悦。他们开会的时候，她替他们望风；他们没有吃饭，她就把留给孩子们吃的仅有的二个白薯给他们吃。甚至在她的丈夫被铁水烧死后邓非去看她时，她也强捺下悲痛，关心地问他吃了饭没有。这是多么博大的胸怀，这正是我们工人阶级的母亲的真切的肖像！
    丈夫的死亡给了母亲沉重的打击。困难增加了。当她恐惧地感到 “前面的路太窄”了的时候，党教育了她，支持了她，使她从黑暗中看到了亮光，使她认识到丈夫死得太软弱，自己绝不能像他那样。她毅然地参加了革命队伍，迅速地提高了阶级觉悟，由一个普通的劳动妇女逐渐成长为一个自觉的革命战士。虽然摆在她面前的实际困难越来愈多，越来越重；但她思想上的路却越来越宽，越来越亮。母亲更加坚强了。我们看到她是多么无畏地挑起了生活的重担！她抚儿育女，忍饥受苦；她忍受着战友邓非牺牲、大儿承文入狱的悲痛，继续坚持工作。她曾经两次被捕入狱，受着敌人严酷的拷问，但她坚贞的意志丝毫没有被磨损。即使在监狱里，她也利用各种机会向犯人宣传革命的道理，坚持为党工作。迎着暴风雨飞翔的海燕，才是海洋的主人；迎着困难前进的战士，才是世界的主人！母亲正是迎着一个接着一个的困难和考验，坚忍不拔地战斗并且取得胜利的。母亲二十多年的奋斗历史，不仅反映了革命力量由小到大、由弱到强的成长过程，也使我们深刻地认识到：胜利不是轻易获得的，而是革命先辈艰苦奋斗的结果！
    共产主义的崇高理想是母亲战胜重重困难的动力。我们还记得她入党宣誓时的情景。微弱的亮光照亮了破旧的小屋；母亲坚定的、低沉的声音震荡着四围的空气：“党要我干什么，我就干什么！头可断，志不变！”母亲认识到实现共产主义是最崇高的革命理想。这个理想，在母亲心里开花发芽，成长为不可战胜的物质力量，使她有勇气去战胜各种困难，因为她知道今天自己所受的苦难，将会为千百万劳苦大众赢得欢乐的明天。
    在党的领导下，不怕困难，艰苦奋斗，这是母亲所走的道路，也正是我们年青一代需要学习和继承的革命传统。我们必须从母亲的思想和斗争中汲取精神力量，勇敢地肩负起建设社会主义的责任。
    无疑的，影片“母亲”将教给我们青年一代很多有益的东西。可惜的是，影片的艺术感染力还不够强烈，母亲还没有以她应有的激动人心的力量站在我们面前。“母亲”所反映的时代背景虽然很宏伟，可是情节却比较分散，不够集中；母亲成长的过程也被切断了，不仅她由一个同情革命的劳动妇女成长为一个自觉的战士的路走得短了一些，就是参加革命以后，她的思想的进一步发展也显得简单了些。在漫长的革命斗争历史中，人物的意识的成长过程比较模糊，这或许就是影片美中不足之处吧！
