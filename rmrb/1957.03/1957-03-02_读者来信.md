Do Not Slaughter Ewes That Can Produce Lambs
Since the opening of the free market, some farmers in Shanxi Province have been slaughtering ewes indiscriminately under the pretext of engaging in sideline production, in order to seek exorbitant profits.

In Da Chang Village, Qingxu County, a so-called sideline production group was organized, headed by production team leader Bi Zhenquan. They bought a total of sixty-one ewes in early December of last year and slaughtered forty-two of them. According to investigations, six of them were pregnant ewes (capable of producing lambs). Later, the remaining nineteen ewes were inspected, including ewes aged five, six, four, and two years, as well as this year's ewe lambs.

Liu Quansuo and others in Beifengrun Village slaughtered ewes after midnight to avoid inspection. Other villages such as Wuda, Dazhai, Mengcun, Kongcun, Taohuaying, Hanwu, and Xugou Town also have people who secretly slaughter ewes.

It is hoped that all localities will pay attention to educating commune members not to slaughter ewes indiscriminately again! Guo Yu

Strict Quarantine Required for Purchasing Horses
In recent years, in order to support agricultural production, various provinces have widely adjusted livestock between provinces. However, some provinces have neglected quarantine work in the purchase of horses. They have even transported horses with glanders, which had been detected in other provinces, back. For example, in Shulu County, Hebei Province, forty-two horses with glanders were transported back from Dalai County, Jilin Province last year, which had been rejected by Liaoning Province. The Benxi City Transportation Company purchased twenty horses last year, and because they were not quarantined, it was discovered after transport that sixteen of them had glanders. We suggest that all localities strengthen quarantine work during the current peak season for livestock adjustment to prevent the spread of livestock infectious diseases. Zhang Dianzhong

    不要杀能生小羊的母羊
    自由市场开放以来，山西省有些农民借口搞副业生产，乱杀母羊，牟取暴利。
    清徐县大常村以生产队长毕振全为首，组织了一个所谓副业生产小组，在去年12月初先后共买母羊六十一只，屠宰了四十二只，据调查，其中有口轻母羊（能生小羊的）六只。后来查验了剩余的十九只母羊，内中五岁、六岁、四岁、二岁等，并有当年的母羊羔。
    北丰润村刘全锁等为了避免检查，把杀母羊的时间放在夜间十二点以后。其他如五答、大寨、孟村、孔村、桃花营、韩武等村和徐沟镇都有偷杀母羊的人。
    希望各地注意教育社员，不要再乱杀母羊了！  郭语
    采购马匹要严格检疫
    近年，各地为了支援农业生产，各省间广泛调剂牲畜。但有些省份，在采购马匹中，忽略了检疫工作。甚至把别省检出来的鼻疽马也运回去了。如河北省束鹿县去年从吉林大赉县运回四十二匹鼻疽马，就是曾经辽宁省检出不要的。本溪市运输社去年采购的二十匹马，因未经检疫，运回后，发现有十六匹是鼻疽病马。我们建议各地在当前牲畜调剂旺季中，应加强检疫工作，以防止牲畜传染病蔓延。张殿忠
