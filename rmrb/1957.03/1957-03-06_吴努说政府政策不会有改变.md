Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 5th. Burmese Prime Minister U Nu stated in the Parliament on the 4th: "Replacing the Prime Minister at this time will not cause any changes in the government's policies and actions, because both the outgoing and incoming governments are formed by the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League."

In his speech, U Nu only talked about domestic issues, especially the issue of domestic peace. U Nu said that his government does not believe that domestic peace can be achieved merely by negotiating with the underground army. He believes that the underground army's request for negotiations is "false." He demanded that they surrender with their weapons.

U Nu said: "Once the rebels' request for negotiations is accepted, the divisions that will inevitably arise within the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League and government institutions will be insurmountable."

U Nu asked the opposition party to "overcome the temptation of party interests and adopt a position purely based on national interests to wholeheartedly support the government."

U Nu won applause when he said that the government had held close discussions with opposition parties on the Sino-Burmese border issue.

    吴努说政府政策不会有改变
    据新华社仰光5日电　缅甸总理吴努4日在国会说：“在这个时候更换总理并不会使政府的政策和行动有任何改变，因为卸职和就任的政府都是由反法西斯人民自由同盟成立的”。
    吴努在他的这次讲话中只谈到了国内问题，特别是国内和平问题，吴努说，他的政府不相信仅仅同地下军进行谈判就能获得国内和平。他认为，地下军方面要求谈判的行动是“虚假的”。他要求他们携带武器投降。
    吴努说：“一旦接受叛乱分子的谈判请求，那么在反法西斯人民自由同盟和政府机构内一定会产生的分歧将是难以克服的。”
    吴努要求反对党“克服党的利益的诱惑和采取纯粹出于民族利益的立场来全心全意地支持政府”。
    当吴努说政府已经就缅中边界问题同反对党派举行了亲密的讨论时，他博得了掌声。
