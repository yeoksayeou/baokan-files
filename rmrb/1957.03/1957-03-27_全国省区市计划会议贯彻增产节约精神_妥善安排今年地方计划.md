The National Provincial, Regional, and Municipal Planning Conference Implements the Spirit of Increasing Production and Practicing Economy

　　Properly Arranges This Year's Local Plans
    (Our Newspaper)　This newspaper reports that the recently held Fourth National Provincial, Regional, and Municipal Planning Conference implemented the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, and preliminarily arranged the local plans for 1957.

    First, in terms of industrial production, the conference conducted special research on the issues of increasing production and practicing economy for certain materials that are not compatible with the needs of national construction and people's livelihoods—coal, steel, timber, cotton yarn, edible oil, and sugar; it was believed that some investment could be appropriately increased to build some small coal mines, small iron mines, small blast furnaces, and improve transportation conditions in certain areas, so that the local coal production in 1957 would increase by 540,000 tons compared to the original plans reported by the provinces, regions, and municipalities, pig iron would increase by 50,000 tons, and timber would increase by 740,000 cubic meters. The conference believed that in industrial production, on the premise of ensuring product quality, it is necessary to strictly conserve the use of raw materials and extensively utilize various usable substitutes, and it is necessary to oppose bad phenomena such as using large materials for small purposes and using long materials for short purposes.

    Second, in terms of agricultural production, the conference believed that because agriculture plays a significant role in the growth of industrial production, the increase in national income, and the improvement of people's livelihoods, it is necessary to strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year. The enthusiasm of the provinces, regions, and municipalities in this regard is very high. Grain output can increase by 36.4 billion catties compared to last year, cotton can increase by 3.77 million dan, and pigs can increase by more than 30 million heads. In order to realize this plan, the conference believed that in addition to further implementing the policy of democratic cooperative management and diversified operations, it is also necessary to appropriately increase agricultural investment, establish some small-scale farmland water conservancy projects that are effective for increasing agricultural production, and try to ensure farmers' needs for chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and the like.

    Third, in terms of basic construction, the conference, based on the situation that the scale of basic construction was too large last year, resulting in relatively tight material and financial resources this year, made appropriate reductions in the scale of basic construction. In accordance with the principles of using limited money to do more and more important things, giving play to investment results more quickly, fully utilizing existing enterprises, appropriately reducing general civilian buildings, appropriately lowering design standards and engineering costs, and so on, the spirit of building the country through diligence and thrift was specifically implemented. The 1957 local basic construction plan was arranged with consideration for the overall situation, and basic construction projects above the quota were re-examined. Some non-urgent projects that could be built or not built were cancelled and postponed, some projects that could be reduced in scale were reduced, and investments in some projects with high design quotas and high engineering costs were reduced. Investments in the construction of employee dormitories and schools were appropriately reduced, and the construction of office buildings, cultural palaces, and guest houses were cancelled. The investment saved was used for agricultural production, which is necessary for national construction and people's livelihoods, the construction of small coal mines, small iron mines, and small blast furnaces, and the increase in timber production. The conference also requested that in the 1957 basic construction, a comprehensive campaign to ensure project quality, save building materials, and reduce project costs should be launched to save national investment and building materials.

    Fourth, in terms of transportation, the conference, in order to ensure the smooth development of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and to improve the relatively tight transportation situation in certain areas, in addition to the 4,330 vehicles (accounting for 62% of domestically produced vehicles) that had been previously allocated to local areas, it also allocated 500 imported vehicles to the southwest, northwest, and other regions. At the same time, some effective measures to improve transportation efficiency were also taken. That is, fully utilizing the transportation capacity of the people and the existing transportation forces, rationally organizing transportation tools; strengthening the maintenance of existing highways, waterways, and transportation projects; improving business management; saving fuel, and trying to modify some vehicles to burn charcoal and anthracite coal.

    The conference emphasized that the potential for increasing production and practicing economy in all aspects of China's national economy is very large. As long as attention is paid to the potential in all aspects and vigorously tapped, the campaign to increase production and practice economy will surely achieve good results. (Liu Hongsheng)

　　全国省区市计划会议贯彻增产节约精神
　　妥善安排今年地方计划
    本报讯　最近举行的第四次全国省、区、市计划会议贯彻了增产节约的精神，初步地安排了1957年的地方计划。
    首先，在工业生产方面，会议对某些跟国家建设和人民生活需要不相适应的物资——煤炭、钢铁、木材、棉纱、食油、食糖等产品的增产节约问题，进行了专门研究；认为可以适当地增加一些投资，建设一些小煤矿、小铁矿、小高炉和改善某些地区的运输条件，使1957年地方煤炭产量较各省、区、市原报计划增加五十四万吨，生铁增加五万吨，木材增加七十四万立方公尺。会议认为：在工业生产中，还应在保证产品质量的条件下，严格节约使用原材料，广泛利用各种可以利用的代用品，必须反对大材小用、长材短用等不良现象。
    其次，在农业生产方面，会议认为：由于农业对工业生产的增长、国家收入的增加和人民生活的改善起着重大作用，因此，必须争取今年农业生产大丰收。各省、区、市在这方面的积极性是很大的。粮食产量较去年可增产三百六十四亿斤，棉花可增产三百七十七万担，猪可增加三千多万头。为了实现这一计划，会议认为：除了必须进一步地贯彻民主办社和多种经营的方针以外，还要适当地增加农业投资，兴办一些对农业增产行之有效的小型农田水利工程，尽量保证农民对化学肥料、农药等的需要。
    第三，在基本建设方面，会议根据去年基本建设规模过大了一些，以至使今年的物资和财政均较紧张的情况，对基本建设的规模作了适当压缩。按照以有限的钱，办更多、更主要的事，更快地发挥投资效果，充分地利用现有企业，适当地压缩一般民用建筑，适当地降低设计标准和工程造价等原则，具体地贯彻勤俭建国的精神，瞻前顾后、统筹兼顾地安排1957年地方基本建设计划，重新审查限额以上的基本建设项目。取消和推迟一些并非急需的、可建可不建的项目，缩小一些可以缩小建设规模的项目，减少一些设计定额偏高、工程造价偏高等项目的投资，适当压缩职工宿舍、学校等建设的投资，取消办公楼、文化宫、招待所等建设。把节省下来的投资用在国家建设和人民生活所必需的农业增产，小煤矿、小铁矿、小高炉的建设及木材增产等方面。会议并要求：在1957年基本建设中，应展开一个全面的保证工程质量、节约建筑材料、降低工程造价的运动，以节省国家投资和建筑材料。
    第四，在交通运输方面，会议为了保证增产节约运动的顺利开展，改善某些地区运输比较紧张的情况，除前已分配给地方的四千三百三十辆汽车（占国产汽车的62％）外，又把进口的五百辆汽车分配给西南、西北等地区。同时，还采取一些提高运输效率的有效措施。即充分地发挥民间和现有的运输力量，合理地组织运输工具；加强对现有公路、航道和运输工程的维护；改善经营管理；节省燃料，设法改装一部分烧木炭和无烟煤的汽车等。
    会议着重指出：我国国民经济各方面增产节约的潜力是很大的，只要注意到各方面的潜力，予以大力挖掘，增产节约运动一定就会得到良好的效果。　（刘洪声）
