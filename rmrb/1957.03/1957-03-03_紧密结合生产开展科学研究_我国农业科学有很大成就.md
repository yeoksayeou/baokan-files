Xinhua News Agency Report: Ding Ying, President of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, reported at the founding meeting of the Academy today that Chinese agricultural scientists, in conjunction with agricultural producers, have not only fully applied and promoted existing achievements that were previously neglected to agricultural production, but have also made many further achievements.

The 69-year-old renowned agricultural scientist said that the large-scale mass seed selection movement participated in by agricultural science workers across the country has yielded good results. The improved wheat variety "Bima No. 1" was planted on 22 million mu last year, and the improved rice variety "Nante No. 1" was planted on an even larger area. These improved varieties generally increased production by 10% to 20% compared to the original varieties. Many new and excellent varieties of crops such as corn and sweet potatoes have also been bred.

In the study of the biological characteristics of important fruit trees, agricultural scientists have greatly improved the quality of fruits and helped farmers summarize the experience of contour trenches and terraced cultivation of fruit trees, enabling the large-scale development of fruit tree cultivation in mountainous areas.

Due to in-depth research on the occurrence patterns and chemical control of locusts, and through mass prevention and control efforts, locust plagues that had persisted for thousands of years no longer cause disasters. The wheat bunt disease in Shandong Province is mainly transmitted through feces. After scientists proposed methods of fecal separation and clean manure control, the wheat disease in this area has also been significantly reduced. There are now also methods for controlling cotton bollworms, cotton aphids, and underground pests. Research results on wheat rust, rice blast, and potato late blight have also been applied to production.

After the successful production of bacterial fertilizers such as peanut and soybean rhizobium preparations, the general yield increase effect is 15% to 20%. Among them, soybean rhizobium preparations have been promoted to more than 15 million mu in Northeast China, adding a large amount of wealth to the country. In addition, preliminary results have been achieved in the improvement and utilization of red soil and saline-alkali soil.

The successful research and cultivation of lapinized rinderpest virus, reaction vaccine, goat-adapted rinderpest attenuated virus, and sheep-adapted rinderpest attenuated virus played a decisive role in eliminating rinderpest in Northeast China, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Good results have also been achieved in the prevention and control of swine fever, equine mange, and the cultivation of new silkworm varieties.

Ding Ying said that China's agricultural science undertaking has reached a considerable scale, and its development has been very rapid in the past seven years. At present, there are 205 agricultural experiment and research institutions in China, an eightfold increase compared to before liberation. Currently, the research personnel of agricultural scientific research institutions under the Ministry of Agriculture, plus the teaching staff of various higher agricultural colleges and related research personnel of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, total about 11,000 people, of which more than 1,340 are professors, researchers, and agricultural technicians or above.

Ding Ying also pointed out that after the basic realization of advanced agricultural cooperation throughout the country, the new relations of production have put forward many new demands for agricultural science. Therefore, researching and solving many scientific and technological problems in agricultural production to promote the development of social productive forces has become the historical task of Chinese agricultural scientists in this great era.

Finally, he put forward opinions on researching how to increase the yield per unit area of ​​crops, developing animal husbandry, sericulture, land reclamation, agricultural mechanization, as well as agricultural economic zoning and agricultural enterprise management.

    紧密结合生产开展科学研究
    我国农业科学有很大成就
    新华社讯  中国农业科学院院长丁颖今天在这个科学院成立大会上报告说：中国农业科学家和农业生产者联结一起，不仅使解放前未被重视的已有的成就在农业生产上得到充分的应用和推广，而且进一步取得了很多成就。
    这位六十九岁的著名的农业科学家说，全国各地农业科学工作者所参加的大规模的群众选种运动已得到良好效果。小麦良种“碧玛一号”去年推广面积达到了二千二百万亩，水稻良种“南特号”推广面积更大，这些良种一般比原有品种增产10％到20％，其它如玉米、甘薯等作物也育成了许多新的优良品种。
    农业科学家在研究重要果树的生物特性的工作中，使果实品质有了很大改进，并帮助农民总结了果树的等高横沟和梯田栽培经验，使果树在山地栽培得到很大发展。
    由于对飞蝗的发生规律和药剂防治进行了深入研究，通过群众性的防治工作，几千年的蝗患不再成灾了。山东地区的小麦纲腥黑穗病，主要是由于粪便传染，在科学家们提出粪种隔离，净粪的防治方法后，这个地区小麦的病害也已显著减轻。对棉花红铃虫、棉蚜和地下害虫，现在也都有了防治方法。小麦锈病、稻瘟病、马铃薯晚疫病研究成果也已运用到生产中。
    细菌肥料如花生、大豆根瘤菌制剂制造获得成功后，一般增产效果在15％到20％，其中大豆根瘤菌制剂在东北地区推广到一千五百万亩以上，为国家增加了大量财富。另外，红壤、盐咸土的改良利用上也有了初步效果。
    兔化牛瘟病毒、反应疫苗、山羊化牛瘟弱毒、绵羊化牛瘟弱毒的研究和培育成功，对扑灭东北、内蒙古自治区和青藏高原等地区牛瘟，起了决定性的作用。在防治猪瘟、马癞病以及培育家蚕新品种等方面也有了良好成就。
    丁颖说：我国农业科学事业已经具有相当的规模，在过去七年中它的发展是很迅速的。现在，我国共有农业试验研究机构二百零五处，与解放前相比较，增加到八倍。目前农业部所属农业科学研究机构的研究人员，加上各高等农业院校的教学人员以及中国科学院的有关研究人员，共约有一万一千多人，其中教授、研究员和农业技师以上的就有一千三百四十多人。
    丁颖还指出：全国农业基本实现了高级合作化以后，新的生产关系对农业科学提出了许多新的要求。因而研究解决农业生产上的许多科学技术问题，以推进社会生产力的发展，就成为我国农业科学家在这一个伟大时代的历史任务。
    最后，他就关于研究提高农作物单位面积产量、发展牧畜业、养蚕业、垦荒、农业机械化以及农业经济区划、农业企业管理等方面的问题提出了意见。
