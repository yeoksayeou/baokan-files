Talking About "Squeezing"
　　Chen Lu

　　"Squeezing" has become a mass topic of conversation in Beijing. In trams and buses, in shops, people have a feeling of being "squeezed."

　　How is "squeezing" caused? There are many reasons, and it is difficult to list them all. Here, I just want to talk about one of the reasons for the congestion, that is, the problem of certain organs and enterprises blindly concentrating in Beijing and blindly expanding their businesses in Beijing. In the streets and alleys, the newly hung signs of "××" organs, "×× Beijing Office," "×× Publishing House," etc. have been increasing in recent years, and after these signs are hung up, they have contributed to the squeezing of all aspects of Beijing. For example, many central-level professional publishing houses are concentrated in Beijing, followed by printing factories springing up like mushrooms after rain. As a result, a large amount of paper is transported to Beijing by trucks and ships; after editing and printing in Beijing, it is transported to various places by trucks and ships again. Since the call to advance towards science was issued, scientific research institutions have developed greatly, which is of course a gratifying phenomenon. But the problem lies in those that can be placed in Beijing, can also not be placed in Beijing, and even should not be placed in Beijing at all, but today they are all gathering in Beijing. Everyone knows that Beijing is a city lacking water, but scientific research institutions related to "water" also want to build research buildings, office buildings, and dormitory buildings in Beijing. The rivers and lakes in Beijing, which were originally just "a breeze ruffling a pool of spring water," are also seen by the leading cadres of these organs as roaring seaports. Because those design and exploration companies for certain metals and certain minerals are "designing" in Beijing, many technical cadres have to take planes and trains several times a year to travel long distances to "the site." There are also some organs that have not yet settled in Beijing, but they also set up a "×× Beijing Office" in Beijing. Organs that are forced to move out of Beijing still have a residual setup in Beijing.

　　Before and after an organ blindly concentrates in Beijing and hangs up a sign, it has to install electric lights, install telephones, buy tables, chairs, bookcases, wardrobes, single and double beds, and prepare offices and dormitories, etc. When cadres come, their families also have to come, and the number of people is several times the number of cadres themselves. In addition to other reasons, every time after work, especially on holidays, queuing to buy vegetables, getting a haircut or taking a bath requires first getting a number...

　　Therefore, to solve the problem of congestion in Beijing, there are of course many ways. Solving the problem of organs and enterprises blindly flowing into Beijing is also an important way. Therefore, please move those organs and enterprises that should not be placed in Beijing but are placed in Beijing to other places; organs and enterprises that can come to Beijing or not, please stay put for the time being! Of course, there are many difficulties in solving this problem. Because the concentration of organs and enterprises in Beijing almost 100% has many "reasons." For example, since a certain General Bureau is in Beijing, the leading cadres of the General Bureau have a "reason" to put a certain Branch Bureau and its affiliated research institutions in Beijing as well. It is said that this can facilitate communication between superiors and subordinates, facilitate work, and overcome bureaucracy, and so on. These "reasons" may be valid for some organs, but not for others. Some people only consider the favorable side and ignore the unfavorable side. That is, the favorable side in the "reasons" is still worth discussing. Bureaucracy must be overcome, but the way to overcome it is to deeply understand the situation and closely connect with the masses. Otherwise, concentrating all organs and enterprises in Beijing, studying water conservancy, hydropower, and hydraulic engineering in Beijing; taking a plane to the site for surveying, and returning to Beijing to design and draw, is this a way to overcome bureaucracy?

　　To change the phenomenon of organs and enterprises blindly concentrating in Beijing, we must also rely on the leading cadres of those organs and enterprises to take the lead!

### 谈“挤”

    谈“挤”
    晨路
    挤，在北京成了一件群众性的话题。在电车和公共汽车里，在商店里，人们都有“挤”的感觉。
    “挤”是怎么造成的？原因很多，难以一一尽述。这里，我只想谈谈造成拥挤的原因之一，就是某些机关企业盲目集中北京和机关企业盲目在北京扩大家业的问题。在大街小巷，新挂出来的“××”机关、“××北京办事处”、“××出版社”等等的牌子，近几年来不断增加，而这些牌子挂出来之后，助长了北京各方面的挤。例如很多中央级的专业出版社在北京集中，紧跟着印刷厂也就如雨后春笋地应运而生。于是乎，大批纸张由车、船运来北京；在北京编辑印刷之后，又由车船运往各地。自从向科学进军的号召发出以后，科学研究机关大大发展了，这当然是可喜的现象。但是毛病发生在那些可以放在北京、也可以不放在北京、甚至是完全不该放在北京的，今天却都在北京凑热闹。谁都知道北京是个缺水的城市，但是和“水”有关的科学研究机关，也要在北京盖研究楼、盖办公楼、盖宿舍楼。在北京原只是“风乍起吹皱一池春水”的河湖，也被这些机关的领导干部看成是白浪滔滔的海港了。因为那些某种金属、某种矿藏的设计勘探公司在北京“设计”，不少技术干部就要一年几次乘坐飞机、火车，长途跋涉远征“现场”。还有的机关眼下虽然还没有在北京落户，可也在北京搞个：“××北京办事处”。迫不得已迁出北京的机关，也还在北京来个留守摊子之类。
    机关盲目集中北京，在挂出牌匾前后，就要装电灯、安电话、买桌椅、书橱、衣柜、单双人床，准备办公室和宿舍等等。干部一来，家属也得来，而且人数几倍于干部本身的数目。再加上其他原因，每逢上下班，尤其在假日，买菜排队、理发洗澡要先领牌挂号……。
    因此，要解决北京的拥挤问题，办法当然很多，解决一下机关、企业盲目流入北京的问题也是一个重要的办法。所以，请那些不应该放在北京而放在北京的机关、企业向外迁移迁移；可来可不来京的机关、企业，也就请他们暂时留步吧！当然，解决这方面的问题是有很多困难的。因为机关、企业集中北京，几乎百分之百都是有很多条“理由”的。例如某某总局既然在北京，总局领导干部就有“理由”把某某分局以及所属的某某研究机关也放在北京。据说，这样可以上下通气，可以便利工作，克服官僚主义云云。这些“理由”对某些机关也可能成立，但对另一些机关就并非如此。有些人只是考虑到有利的一面，而忽略了不利的一面。即在“理由”中的有利一面，分析一下也还是有值得商榷之处。官僚主义是必须克服的，但克服的方法是深入了解情况，密切联系群众。不然，把机关、企业都集中在北京，在北京来研究水利、水力、水工；坐飞机去现场勘测，回到北京设计绘图，这是克服官僚主义的办法吗？
    要改变机关、企业盲目集中北京的现象，还得依靠那些机关、企业的领导干部起个带头作用！
