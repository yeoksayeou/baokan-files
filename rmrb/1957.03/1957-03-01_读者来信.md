Reader's Letters

	Unacceptable Experience

	The Henan Provincial State-Owned Nanyang Silk Weaving Factory once promoted an "advanced experience," the main content of which was to deduct workers' wages for substandard products. At the same time, the factory had the following provision in its piecework wage regulations: pieceworkers' wages are calculated based on first-class products. For warping, weft insertion, silk reeling, reed hooking, and yarn joining, 50% of wages are deducted for defective products; for feathering and silk repair, no wages are paid at all for substandard products. It is said that this is the most effective method to improve product quality.

	Since the implementation of this piecework wage regulation more than ten months ago, 90% of the pieceworkers have been punished to varying degrees – wage deductions. Qin Tingrun, a feathering worker, had 10% of his monthly wage deducted last September for a substandard product (not including sick and maternity leave wages). Now, workers enter the workshop with anxiety, constantly worried that disaster will strike at any moment.

	In their view, deducting wages is the only magic weapon to ensure and improve product quality, and it is beyond reproach. However, the facts tell people that this approach is counterproductive. Many factors affect product quality in silk factories, including operational negligence, changes in materials, the condition of machinery and equipment, control of workshop temperature, technical proficiency, the reasonableness of operations, as well as labor organization, management systems, ideological education, etc. Even a quarrel between a worker and their spouse can affect product quality. To find the reasons for poor product quality, it is necessary to do more specific analysis and research. More importantly, it is necessary to strengthen ideological education for workers and give play to the initiative and creativity of the masses so that the problem can be solved. But the leading cadres of this factory see such a detailed work as so simple.

	The result of deducting wages has not only failed to reduce substandard products, but has also affected workers' lives and solidarity. This factory operates on three shifts, and a piece of feathering is often completed by workers from all three shifts. If the feathering is substandard after it is taken off the machine, not only do the workers not get paid, but they also cannot participate in the selection of advanced producers. This creates mutual suspicion and complaints among the three shifts of workers, which has a great impact on workers' solidarity.

	This practice of doing less ideological work and focusing on deducting wages should be stopped immediately. Li Ruran

	Encouraging Income, Significant Waste

	The Luoyang Farm Implement Repair Factory has accumulated a large amount of "iron shavings" in production over the years. The factory completely regarded these as waste and did not try to utilize them. In July last year, these iron shavings had nowhere to be piled, and the factory spent 107 yuan to hire a batch of carts to clear them away as garbage.

	The Taicang Agricultural Production Cooperative in nearby Mengjin County discovered that this was a treasure and organized twelve members to try to smelt these iron shavings into iron. From September last year to January this year, they smelted a total of 89,000 jin of iron, selling it for more than 11,000 yuan.

	For the Taicang Agricultural Cooperative, this is undoubtedly an encouraging income, but for the Luoyang Farm Implement Repair Factory, isn't this a considerable waste? Wu Junmin

	Such "Sanitation"

	Recently, dozens of workers from the Hegang Coal Mine who went to the Mudanjiang Coal Mine Workers' Sanatorium for recuperation were "bounced" back. The main reason was that the arrival date specified on the sanatorium certificate had passed, and the sanatorium refused to admit them on the grounds that it was "invalid after the expiration date."

	These workers were not willing to "expire" themselves, but the trade union issued the sanatorium certificates late. The sanatorium also knew this, but in order to "enforce the system," it made the recuperating workers travel back and forth on a fruitless journey.

	We can't help but ask: Why did the trade union cadres of Hegang Coal Mine issue the sanatorium certificates late? Why did the Mudanjiang Coal Mine Workers' Sanatorium implement the system so mechanically, making the workers suffering from illness travel back and forth on the train? Are these practices really serving the recuperating personnel? Peng Huazheng

    要不得的经验
    河南省地方国营南阳丝织厂，曾推广了一项“先进经验”，这项经验的主要内容就是出了副品就扣工人的工资。同时，这个厂在计件工资规程里还有这样的规定：计件工均以正品计算工资。络经、打纬、缫丝、扻经、接头等工种，出了废品则扣工资50％；羽纱、修绸等工种出了副品全部不发工资。据说这是提高产品质量最有效的方法。
    自从贯彻了这个计件工资规程以后，十个多月来，有90％的计件工受到了不同程度的惩办——扣工资。羽纱工序档车工秦廷润，去年9月份出了副品，一个月的工资扣掉10％（不包括病、产假工资）。现在工人一进到车间，就提心吊胆，非常紧张，不知道啥时候就会祸从天降。
    扣工资的目的，在他们看来，这是保证和提高产品质量的唯一法宝，是无可非议的。但是，事实却告诉了人们，这种做法是事与愿违的。丝厂影响产品质量的因素很多，除了操作上的疏忽大意之外，还有材料的变化、机器设备的好坏、车间温度的控制情况、技术的熟练程度、操作是否合理，以及劳动组织、管理制度、思想教育等等，这些都和产品质量有关；甚至工人和爱人吵了嘴，也会影响产品质量。要想找出产品质量不高的原因，必须多做具体的分析研究工作，更重要的是对工人加强思想教育，发挥群众的积极性创造性，问题才能解决。但是这个厂的领导干部，却把这样一个细致的工作看得那么简单。
    扣工资的结果，不仅没有使副品减少，反而影响工人的生活，影响了工人的团结。这个工厂是三班生产，一匹羽纱往往由三班工人完成。羽纱下机以后，要是副品，不但工人拿不到工资，而且也不能参加先进生产者的评选。这样就造成了三个班的工人互相猜疑、抱怨，对工人的团结有很大影响。
    这种少做思想工作，而在扣工资上打算盘的做法，应该立即停止。  李茹然
    可喜的收入  重大的浪费
    洛阳机具修配厂这几年在生产中积下了大量“铁刨屑”。厂里把这些东西完全看作废物，没有设法加以利用。去年7月间，这些铁刨屑已经无处堆放了，厂里出了一百零七元，雇一批架子车来，把它们当垃圾清理了出去。
    附近孟津县的太仓农业生产合作社发现这是一笔财富，便组织十二名社员设法把这些铁屑熔炼成铁。从去年9月到今年1月，他们共炼出八万九千斤铁，卖得一万一千多元。
    对太仓农业社来说，这无疑的是一笔可喜的收入，但是，对洛阳机具修配厂来说，这难道不是一笔不小的浪费吗？  吴俊敏
    如此“疗养”
    最近，鹤岗煤矿有几十个到牡丹江煤矿工人疗养院疗养的工人被“碰”了回来。主要原因是疗养证上规定的到达日期已经过了，疗养院便以“过期无效”为名，拒不收留。
    这些工人并不是自己愿意“过期”，而是工会发疗养证就发晚了。疗养院也知道这种情况，但是为了“执行制度”，就让疗养员们来回跑冤枉路。
    我们不禁要问：鹤岗煤矿的工会干部为什么要把疗养证发晚了？牡丹江煤矿工人疗养院为什么这么机械地执行制度，让带着病痛的工人在火车上来回受折磨？他们这些作法难道真正是为疗养人员服务吗？  彭华正
