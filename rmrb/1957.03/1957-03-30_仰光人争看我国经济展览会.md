Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, March 29th: On average, one in every four of Yangon's 800,000 residents has visited the Chinese Economic Exhibition currently being held in Yangon.

According to statistics, 220,000 people have visited the exhibition in the week since its opening on March 20th.

Speaker of the Burmese Chamber of Nationalities, Sao Hkun Hkio, said that the large number of visitors attracted by the exhibition demonstrated the Burmese people's love for and widespread interest in the exhibition. He said he had already visited the exhibition twice, but he was not satisfied. He will visit the exhibition a third time. Many people brought their entire families to visit the exhibition.

Burmese business and industrial circles are particularly interested in China's heavy and light industrial products. U Mya, a member of the Economic Committee of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League and a well-known Burmese national capitalist, believes that the exhibition will help the Burmese people understand China's industrial achievements.

The sections exhibiting works of art and handicrafts, as well as models of the Yangtze River Bridge and the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, are often very crowded.

U Myint Wun, editor of the "Economic Daily," wrote: "The exhibition makes us Asians proud. If the Asian people want to catch up with the world's great powers, we must develop our industries. We are excited to see that the People's Republic of China has realized this wish."

The Singapore and Malaya trade delegation, which is currently visiting Burma, said: "This exhibition will produce good results in economic and cultural exchanges between Southeast Asian countries and China." (Attached picture)

　　仰光人争看我国经济展览会
    新华社仰光29日电  仰光的八十万居民平均每四个人当中就有一个人参观了现在正在仰光举行的中国经济展览会。
    据统计，从3月20日开幕以后的一星期里已经有二十二万人参观了展览会。
    缅甸国会民族院议长萧恢塔说，展览会所吸引的大批观众表现了缅甸人民对展览会的喜爱和广泛的兴趣。他说，他已经到展览会参观了两次，但是他还不满足。他将第三次参观展览会。许多人带了他们的全家参观展览会。
    缅甸工商界人士对于中国重工业和轻工业产品特别感到兴趣。反法西斯人民自由同盟经济委员会委员、缅甸著名民族资本家吴名认为，展览会将帮助缅甸人民了解中国取得的工业成就。
    展出艺术品和手工艺品以及长江大桥和鞍山钢铁公司模型的部分经常十分拥挤。
      “经济日报”主编吴密乌写道：“展览会使我们亚洲人感到骄傲。如果亚洲人民要赶上世界大国，我们必须发展我们的工业。看到中华人民共和国实现了这个愿望，我们感到兴奋。”
    现在正在缅甸访问的新加坡和马来亚贸易代表团说：“这个展览会将在东南亚国家和中国之间的经济交流和文化交流方面产生良好的结果。”（附图片）
