　　Old Commune Member Wang Buzhong
　　By our reporter Tian Liu

　　After breakfast, Director Wang of the agricultural cooperative led me to the various production teams.

　　The Daquanshan Township is composed of seven natural villages. Each village is considered a "work area," and each "work area" has a production team. The various natural villages are three to five li away from Daquanshan. Today, we decided to first visit the Wangqianhuling work area in the southeast, then from Wangqianhuling to Sixingzhuang, Pujialiang, and finally return from Pujialiang to Daquanshan. Director Wang calculated the distance for me, a total of sixteen li; however, he warned, "The distances in the mountains are not accurate. Saying sixteen li, it might be more than twenty."

　　Daquanshan Township is located southeast of Yanggao County and is a mountainous area. According to measurements by the soil and water conservation station established here by the state, the average altitude of this place is 1,200 meters above sea level. However, it seems that its peaks are not large or high, and the road we were walking on was on the top of a mountain. The mountaintop was very flat and wide, and a large portion had already been cultivated into farmland or planted with trees. The farmland was planted with alfalfa and flax. The flax was growing very well and was in bloom, appearing as a beautiful expanse of blue from afar.

　　We talked about the situation of each production team while enjoying the scenery. Walking in the mountains and fields in the early morning was indescribably wonderful. The colorful mountain flowers were covered with sparkling dewdrops, looking so bright and delicate. Especially the cowhorn flower, with its small, bright blue, trumpet-shaped petals, had a white, sharp, and thin little cowhorn extending from behind, looking playful and amusing, like a child with a pigtail, opening its toothless mouth and laughing at you. A large herd of livestock appeared jubilantly on the mountain ahead, followed by three or four young lads singing songs. Director Wang looked in that direction and turned to me, saying, "See that person behind the youths?"

　　Behind the youths was a person wearing a black jacket and a felt hat. When I first arrived in Daquanshan, I found it strange that people were still wearing jackets during the hottest days of summer. After experiencing the unpredictable weather here for a few days, I regretted not bringing more clothes with me. Here, the weather is usually warm, but when it's cloudy and rainy, it feels as cool as late autumn. At this time, the person wearing the jacket and felt hat was pulling a jet-black little mule up a very steep hillside. The hillside was so steep that I was worried he would fall down. But he kept pulling the unruly mule upwards.

　　"Hee hee!" the man called out, "Come on, come on! The grass is tender here. Hee hee, come on, you bad thing, you fool." The little mule didn't listen to him, jumping and hopping to chase after the herd of livestock that had already reached us. The man plucked a bunch of green grass, put it to the mule's mouth, and gently patted its forehead, saying with the affection of a parent instructing their child, "Don't go with them, I'll take you to a good place...."

　　"How old do you think he is?"

　　"Forty-something," I replied after looking at him again.

　　"How much? Forty-something!" Director Wang suddenly laughed out loud, "I knew you wouldn't guess right, but I didn't expect you to be so far off."

　　I was a little embarrassed by his laughter. I had never been so wrong when estimating someone's age, so how could I have misjudged it this time?

　　"How old is he then?"

　　"No more, no less, one year shy of seventy."

　　"Ah!" I exclaimed in surprise, "You really can't tell!"

　　"Not just you, no one who doesn't know would guess it," Director Wang said. "We have several old men in our cooperative who are strong, have peculiar tempers, but work even harder than young people."

　　Then, he told me about this seemingly very young 69-year-old man. His name is Wang Buzhong, and he is skilled at handling livestock, planting crops, plowing the land, and hoeing seedlings. Last autumn, the cooperative bought two skinny and weak cows from Datong. When the members saw them, no one wanted to take responsibility for feeding them, let alone use these "unlucky things" that would lie down and not get up, stop and not move. The old man said, "I'll feed them." Wang Buzhong's home was quite far from the cowshed. The old man felt it was inconvenient to get up in the middle of the night to feed the livestock, so he moved into the cowshed. At night, when others were asleep, he would stand by the manger, often standing for most of the night. Only when the cows were full and started ruminating did he go back to sleep. During the day, before others had gotten up, he had already harnessed the cows and gone to plow the fields. In the late morning, when it got hot and there were many horseflies, while others were still whipping the animals to get them to work, the old man had already let the cows loose on the hillside to graze. The afternoon was the same. As soon as noon arrived, others were busy whipping their animals to go to the fields, but the old man was still keeping his two cows in the shade of the trees, letting them ruminate. Only when the sun was setting and it was no longer hot did he go back to plowing. When plowing, the old man never got impatient with the cows, always working according to their strength. Every day after dinner, when he went to the work point recorder to report his work and get points, the recorder would always say to him, "Old man Buzhong, you didn't complete the quota again today, so you can only get nine points." The old man would always smile honestly and say:

　　"Nine points are fine, that's not bad." Or he would say:

　　"Plowing is not like hoeing seedlings, which relies solely on one's own strength. I can't work the cooperative's cows to death just to earn more work points for myself."

　　In this way, the cooperative stipulated that plowing four and a half mu of land counted as one labor day, but he always plowed four mu, or three mu and eight fen. After autumn, his two cows were fat and strong. In winter, when the upsurge of cooperativization came and their agricultural cooperative merged with eleven other cooperatives in the township to form a large cooperative, the cooperative wanted to sell some cows to buy mules and horses, and one of the cows that the old man used was also sold. The cow was bought for forty yuan and sold for one hundred and twenty yuan.

　　"This old man is just such an eccentric, interesting person. Let's get him to come over and you can talk to him yourself." Director Wang said, and without waiting for my agreement, he loudly called out to the old man, "Old man Buzhong, come and take a break."

　　Having said that, he sat down on a large rock by the roadside and asked me to sit beside him. The old man heard someone calling him, used his hand to shield his eyes from the sun, looked around, and seeing that it was us, ran down from the steep slope of four or five zhang with the little mule in three steps or two. In the blink of an eye, he was already sitting beside us. He didn't greet us, nor did he wait for Director Wang to speak, and began to complain:

　　"Look what you've done to the livestock's mouth!" the old man said angrily. "You just talk about raising mules and horses, is this a small matter? Each one is worth hundreds of yuan, if something happens to them, the cooperative will suffer a great loss!"

　　The mule's upper and lower lips were covered with dense, bean-sized blisters. When Director Wang saw it, he also became anxious and asked the old man what had happened.

　　"Raising livestock is like taking care of children, you have to pay attention at all times or something will go wrong," the old man said, as if he hadn't heard Director Wang's words, still talking about what he wanted to say, "A few days ago, the livestock were driven to the Yanggao beach grassland to graze. Who among that group of young people has any common sense? Regardless of whether it was cloudy or rainy, day or night, they just let the livestock loose and didn't care about anything else. The stagnant pools of water on the grassland, heated by the sun, wouldn't they become hot? The livestock were thirsty and had no water to drink, so they had to drink that stagnant water with green foam. It would be strange if they didn't get sick!"

　　The old man's temper was really bad, shouting at Director Wang as if Director Wang had damaged the livestock. It wasn't until Director Wang told him for the fourth time that this matter would be investigated later and that he was being asked to come over because I wanted to talk to him, that the old man seemed to realize my presence for the first time, smiled apologetically, and said:

　　"I just have this explosive temper, I can't stand people wasting things. The livestock belong to the cooperative, and doesn't the cooperative belong to everyone?"

　　Old man Wang Buzhong is not only a person with an impatient personality but also a cheerful and amiable person. When I talked to him about the cooperative's crops and soil and water conservation work this year, when I talked to him about the changes in his life, the old man kept smiling happily.

　　"There's nothing to say, if we hadn't established agricultural cooperatives, could so many trees have grown on this loess mound, could such good crops have grown?"

　　The old man had a habit of repeating your question, confirming it thoroughly, before answering it.

　　"You ask me how I'm doing? Sigh, good, good, getting better and better, stronger every year. Look at the flock of sheep on the eastern slope, the mules and horses in front of you, the trees and crops all over the mountain, which one doesn't have my share? In the early years, I herded cattle for people, herded sheep, worked as a hired hand, I really didn't expect that someone about to be buried would be resurrected, and would still enjoy a few years of socialist blessings!"

　　He felt so deeply and intimately about the agricultural cooperative, talking about the cooperative as if he were talking about his own home. I asked him how many years he had been a member, and he smiled and said:

　　"How many years have I been a member? I joined as soon as it was established. In 1953, the cadres advocated establishing cooperatives, and I said: I'll join. At that time, the masses were surprised, saying: There are cadres who haven't joined yet, why are you old man in such a hurry? To be honest, at that time I really didn't know what a cooperative was; but if you don't know about agricultural cooperatives, don't you know about the Communist Party and Chairman Mao? Chairman Mao advocated that we peasants establish agricultural cooperatives, so how could that be wrong!"

　　The winter before last, the old man heard that the socialist upsurge was coming, and the cooperative was going to merge and become an advanced cooperative. He was extremely happy and said, "Socialism has finally arrived!" He took the lead in requesting the transition. After the cooperative merged into a senior cooperative of more than 500 households in the whole township, the old man worked even harder. In the spring, when hoeing, he hoed faster and more carefully than the young people. Every time the team leader checked everyone's work, he always praised him first. And that's not all, he not only did well himself, but also gave suggestions when he saw others not working carefully, and even got angry if someone didn't listen to him. Director Wang told me that he was the "honorary inspector" of the Wangqianhuling production team.

　　"He inspects even more carefully and promptly than the inspectors," Director Wang said, "From morning to night, he's always working with everyone. As soon as he sees someone not doing well, he immediately yells, and he won't stop yelling until you change it."

　　"If I don't yell, how will it do?" Wang Buzhong interjected, "That group of young people are always laughing and singing while working. I'm not afraid of singing or laughing, but you have to do your job well! Once they start singing, they forget about the job, and inevitably leave the weeds as seedlings, and chop down the seedlings for you as weeds with one hoe...."

　　I really wanted to sit with the old man for a little longer. But I was afraid that sitting for too long would delay the visits to other production teams, so I had to bid farewell to the old man. We had already walked quite far, and the old man called us back again, saying:

　　"It's not that I dislike young people being happy and singing, it's that I dislike them not being careful with their work. When I was as old as them, I was so hungry I couldn't even sing. Today's young people don't know what hunger is, what famine is. The good days ahead are all theirs, how can they not be happy? But I say don't spoil them too much. They should know how to be happy, know how to sing, and also know how to do their job well, know how to farm. You can't grow grain just by singing."

　　Director Wang told him that education for the young people would definitely be strengthened in the future, and the old man waved his hand to let us go. When we had just walked down the small earth mound that was less than a hundred steps away, and looked back at him, the old man had already led his little mule and climbed the very high and steep mountain to the east. The lapels of his jacket were blown by the summer wind, fluttering around him, like the giant wings of a mountain eagle. Isn't that right, he himself is very much like a giant mountain eagle, though already old, still soaring at the peak of life.

    老社员王布忠
    本报记者　田流
    早饭后，农业社的王主任领我到各个生产队去。
    大泉山乡是七个自然村组成的。每个村算作一个“作业区”，每个“作业区”有一个生产队。各个自然村离大泉山都有三、五里。今天我们决定先访问东南边的王千户岭作业区；然后再由王千户岭到四姓庄、普家梁，最后再由普家梁返回大泉山。王主任给我计算了一下路程，共十六里；不过他警告说：“山里的路程没准头，说十六里，怕二十里也不止。”
    大泉山乡在阳高县城东南方，是山区。据国家设在这里的水土保持工作站测量，这地方平均拔海一千二百公尺。但是看来它的山头并不大，也不高，我们走的路就在山顶上。山顶很平坦，宽广，已经有很大一部分被开垦成了耕地或栽上树木了。耕地上种着苜蓿和胡麻。胡麻长的很好，正在扬花，远远望去，一片碧蓝，十分好看。
    我们一面谈着各生产队的情况，一面欣赏着景色。清晨，在山野间行走，实在有说不出的美妙，五颜六色的山花上带着亮晶晶的露珠儿，显得那么艳丽姣嫩。特别是牛角花，在它那碧蓝碧蓝的小喇叭形的花朵后面，伸出了一只白色的、又尖又细的小牛角，样子又佻皮又好玩，活像一个梳着冲天杵小辫的孩子，张着还没长牙的小嘴巴朝你哈哈大笑。一大群牲畜，欢蹦活跳地出现在前面的山头上，后面跟着三、四个唱着歌的青年小伙子。王主任朝那边望了望，回头对我说：“看见青年们后边那个人了么？”
    青年们后面是一个穿黑夹袄，头上戴着一顶毡帽头的人。我刚到大泉山的时候，见人们在三伏天还穿夹衣，很奇怪。住过几天以后，亲身经历了一下这变化无常的天气，自己也后悔临来的时候不多带点衣服了。这里，平常日子很温暖，一遇天阴下雨，简直清凉得像是深秋。这时候，那个穿夹袄戴毡帽的人，正把一头墨黑的小骡驹拉上一个很陡的山坡。山坡那么陡，我真担心他要跌下来。可他还是一个劲地往上拉那头不听话的骡驹子。
    “吁吁！”那人?喝着，“来，来！这里草嫩。吁吁，来呀，坏东西，傻货。”小骡驹不听他的话，蹦呀跳地要去追赶已经走到我们面前的牲口群。戴毡帽的人用手拔了一束青草，送到骡驹嘴边，轻轻地拍着它的脑门，像嘱咐自己孩子似地亲切地说：“别跟它们一块去，我领你到个好地方去……。”
    “你看他有多大年岁了？”
    “四十多岁。”我再看了看他，这样回答。
    “多少？四十多岁！”王主任突然哈哈大笑起来，“我就知道你猜不对，可没想到你差的这么远。”
    在他的大笑面前，我有点不好意思。估计人的年纪，从来也没差到哪里去过，怎么这回竟走了眼？
    “多大了呢？”
    “不多不少，差一岁七十。”
    “啊！”我惊讶地吐了口气，“真看不出哩！”
    “不光你，不知道的谁也得输了眼。”王主任说，“我们社里有这么好几个老汉，身体强健，脾气古怪，可干活比青年人还泼。”
    接着，他跟我谈起这位显得十分年青的六十九岁的老人来。他叫王布忠，使牲口、种庄稼、耕地锄苗都是好把式。去年秋天，社里从大同买回两头又瘦又弱的母牛，社员们一看，谁也不愿负责喂养，更不肯使唤这卧倒起不来、停住再不走的“倒楣货”。老汉说： “我喂它们。”王布忠家离牛棚挺远，老汉觉着黑夜里起来喂牲口不方便，就搬到牛棚里来住。晚上，别人睡觉了，他还站在牛槽边，常常一站就是多半宿；几时牛吃饱了，开始倒嚼（反刍）了，他才回屋里睡觉。白天，别人还没起床，他早套上牛犋耕地去了。半前晌，天热了，牛虻多起来，别人还正在打着牲口赶活的时候，老汉已经把牛撒在山坡上吃草了。下午也是一样，刚起晌，别人就忙着打起牲口下地了，老汉还拉着他的两头牛在树荫凉里让它们倒嚼哩。直等到太阳平西，不热了，才又去耕地。耕地的时候，老汉从来没有跟牛发过急躁，总是量着牛的力气做活。每天晚饭后他去记工员家报工记分的时候，记工员总是对他说：“布忠老汉，今天你又没完成定额，只能记九分。”老汉总是憨厚地笑笑，说：
    “九分就九分吧，不少啦。”要不，就说：
    “耕地不比锄苗子，光凭自个儿的力气干。我不能为自家多挣工分，把社里的牛累坏了。”
    就这样，社里规定耕四亩半地算一个劳动日，他总是耕四亩、三亩八。秋天过后，他的两头牛又肥又壮。冬天，合作化高潮一来，他们的农业社同全乡十一个社合并成一个大社以后，社里要卖掉几头牛买成骡马，老汉使唤的两头牛也卖掉了一头。那头牛买的时候是四十元，卖的时候竟卖了一百二十元。
    “这老汉就是这样个怪脾气，有个意思。叫他来你亲自同他谈谈吧。”王主任说着，不等我同意，就大声招呼老汉：“布忠老汉，来歇会儿吧。”
    说罢，就坐在路旁的一块大石头上，要我也坐在他的身旁。老汉听见有人唤他，用手打起凉篷，四外望了望，见是我们，三步两步就拉着小骡驹从四、五丈高的陡坡上跑下来。转眼，已经坐在我们身旁了。他不同我们打招呼，也不等王主任开口，就诉起苦来：
    “你看看把牲口这嘴弄成啥样了！”老汉气呼呼地说，“光说养骡养马，这是小事吗？一匹就是好几百块钱，要有个好歹，社里受多大损失！”
    那骡驹的上下嘴唇上长满了密密层层黄豆大的肿泡。王主任一见，也着起急来，问老汉是怎么搞的？
    “养牲口就跟照顾小孩儿一样，一时注意不到就要出岔子。”老汉好像没有听见王主任的话，还是照着自己的思路说自己要说的话，“前几天把牲口赶到阳高滩草地上去放了，那伙年青后生谁是有心眼子的？不管阴天下雨，黑天白日，把牲口一撒，就什么也不管了。草地上那死水窝子，叫太阳一晒，还有不发烫的，牲口渴了没水饮，只好去喝那起着绿泡沫子的死水，不生病才怪哩！”
    老汉的脾气真急，一个劲冲着王主任喊，好像是王主任把牲口弄坏的。直到王主任第四次告诉他，这件事情回头要检查，现在请他来是我想同他谈谈，老汉才像第一次意识到我的存在，抱歉地笑笑说：
    “我就是这爆竹脾气，见不得人糟害东西。牲口是社里的，社还不是自家的。”
    王布忠老汉不光是个性情急躁的人，还是个秉性快乐、和蔼可亲的人。当我同他谈起今年社里的庄稼和水土保持工作的时候，当我同他谈起他的生活变化的时候，老汉一直乐呵呵地笑着。
    “没说的，要是不办农业社，我们这黄土疙疸上还能长起这么多树，还能长这么好庄稼？”
    老汉说话有个习惯，总是把你的问话重复一遍，钉真切了，再回答你的问题。
    “你问我光景过得怎样？咳，好，好，步步高升，一年比一年强啦。你看东山坡上那羊群，眼面前这骡马，满山的林木、庄稼，哪一样没有我的份？早年，我给人放过牛，揽过羊，作过长工，真不想眼看快入土的人又还阳啦，还要享几年社会主义的福呢！”
    他对农业社感情这样深，这样亲，谈起合作社，就像谈自己的家。我问他入社几年了，他笑笑，说：
    “我入社几年了？一建社就入了。1953年，干部提倡建社，我说：我入。当时群众都奇怪，说：干部还有不入的呢，你老汉着什么急呢？说实在的，当时我还是真不知道合作社是怎么回事；可你不知道农业社，还不知道共产党、毛主席？毛主席提倡要咱农民成立农业社，那还有错！”
    前年冬天，老汉听说社会主义高潮来啦，社要合并，转成高级社，他高兴极了，说：“社会主义终究到啦！”带着头儿要求转。社并成全乡五百多户的高级社以后，老汉干的更起劲了。春天，锄地时比年青后生还锄得快，锄得细致，每次队长检查大家的活儿，总是第一个先表扬他。这还不算，他不光自己干的好，看见别人作活不仔细时就提意见，就说，碰到有人不听他的还要发两下脾气。王主任告诉我：他是王千户岭生产队的“名誉检查员”。
    “比检查员检查的还认真还及时哩，”王主任说，“从早到晚总跟大伙儿在一起干活，看见谁做的不好了立时就嚷，非嚷得你改了不住口。”
    “我不嚷行么，”王布忠接口说，“那伙青年后生干起活来总是笑呀唱的。不怕唱不怕笑，你可得把营生干好啊！一唱就忘了营生，短不了把草当苗子留下，把苗子当草给你一锄砍掉……。”
    真想跟老汉一块儿多坐一阵子。又怕坐的过久了耽误对别的生产队的访问，不得不向老汉告别。我们已经走很远了，老汉又把我们叫住，说：
    “我不是嫌年青后生们高兴，唱歌，是嫌他们作营生不仔细。我老汉像他们这么大，肚饿的想唱也唱不出来。如今的青年人不知道什么是饿，什么是饥，往后的好日子尽是他们的，还有个不高兴的？可我说别太娇养了他们，会高兴，会唱歌，也得会作营生，会作庄稼。光唱歌长不出粮食来。”
    王主任告诉他，往后一定要对青年们加强教育，老汉才摆摆手叫我们走。当我们刚走下那个不满百步的小土岗，回头看他的时候，老汉已经拉着他的小骡驹，登上了东边那个很高很陡的山头。夏风把他那夹袄的大襟吹得直在他身边飞舞，好像山鹰的巨大的翅膀。不是么，他本人就很像一只巨大的山鹰呢，虽然已经年老，仍然飞翔在生活的顶峰。
