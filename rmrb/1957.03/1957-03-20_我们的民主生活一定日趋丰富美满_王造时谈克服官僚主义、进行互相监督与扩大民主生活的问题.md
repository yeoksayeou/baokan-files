Having listened to Premier Zhou's report on his visit to eleven Asian and European countries, and considering it in light of the development of the international situation, I deeply feel that this visit has made an immeasurable contribution to the unity of Asian countries, the unity of socialist countries, and the unity of all peace-loving countries and peoples. It has also had a broad and far-reaching impact on the struggle against colonialism and the movement to defend world peace, giving our country higher prestige and a more important position in the international arena. Therefore, I express my sincerest respect to Premier Zhou for his hard work for the country.

This time I had the opportunity to hear Chairman Mao's wise instructions at the enlarged meeting of the Supreme State Conference on how to handle the internal relations of the people, and I felt particularly fortunate. These instructions will play a decisive role in the increasingly perfect national life and the rapid development of socialist construction. I have received great inspiration and infinite encouragement. Under this inspiration and encouragement, I would now like to talk about the issues of overcoming bureaucratism, conducting mutual supervision, and expanding democratic life.

It was not easy for us Chinese, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, to finally overthrow feudalism, drive out imperialism, eliminate bureaucratic capitalism, and build the edifice of a socialist society from a backward base of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism. This is a great cause in human history, but it is by no means an easy one. In the process of building socialism, new contradictions, new difficulties, and new shortcomings are naturally unavoidable. We should face them squarely and not be complacent with the great achievements we have already made and ignore them. I feel that we should hold a telescope in one hand to look far ahead, see the trend of the times, affirm the main achievements, compare them with the backwardness of the past, and look forward to the future, so that we can be full of confidence and move towards a socialist future without being confused by individual, local, and temporary detours. With the other hand, we should hold a microscope to discover the contradictions, difficulties, and shortcomings in our work, prevent them before they form, eliminate them in their infancy, or solve them when problems have already occurred, so as to avoid unnecessary losses. Chairman Mao instructed us that the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and the contradictions among the people can be transformed; if the relations of contradictions among the people are not handled well, they may also be transformed into relations of contradictions between ourselves and the enemy.

How can we handle the relations of contradictions among the people well? First of all, we must overcome bureaucratism. Bureaucratism was originally a product of feudalism and capitalism, but if socialism is poisoned by its legacy and not thoroughly eliminated, then the losses and harms it causes will be particularly great. Because in our socialist country, the scope of government activities is becoming wider and wider, the things managed by the government are becoming more and more complex, the power of the government is becoming greater and greater, the government's institutions are becoming more and more complex, and the number of government staff is increasing. The government has close relations with all aspects of people's lives everywhere. Our eating, clothing, housing, walking, and entertainment are all related to government facilities. From before we are born until after we die, we cannot transcend politics. For example, advocating birth control is a matter before birth, and advocating cremation is a matter after death. The government is there to serve the people wholeheartedly, but it is not, and cannot be, able to handle everything well. We should demand that things be done better and that fewer mistakes be made. Because if a decision is wrong, or the implementation of a measure deviates, the damage suffered by the people can be great. For example, if the relevant government departments do not promote pig farming, the people will have less pork to eat; if the preliminary investigation and design are not good, tens of thousands of double-wheeled double-furrow plows will be wasted; if the business of raising chickens and ducks is not familiar, there will be a large number of deaths; if attention is not paid to the production of grass paper, even grass paper will become scarce.

But what is bureaucratism? It is not easy to give it a definition. Its manifestations may be these: First, not following the mass line; that is, not going deep into the masses, not believing in the masses, not relying on the masses; looking upward and not downward, only knowing how to understand the intentions of the superiors, not listening to the voices of the people below, not reflecting the opinions of the masses, thus separating from the masses, and the distance between them and the masses in terms of feelings and life is getting farther and farther. Second, liking to report good news but not bad news. Thus, "speaking according to the color of the face, divination according to the Buddha," pleasant words become more and more, and unpleasant words become less and less. As a result, one listens to only one side, does not understand the overall situation, and thus acts arbitrarily, causing errors. Third, adhering to old practices, not asking about the effect; only seeking to avoid mistakes, not seeking to achieve merit; shifting responsibility if possible, and perfunctorily if not. As for putting on airs and showing off, these are other matters. If we treat work with such a style, how can the work be done well?

In view of this, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, in order to prevent problems before they occur, announced the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision last year. Although this mainly refers to the relations between parties, I hope to extend it to all people's organizations, all institutions, all enterprises, all agricultural cooperatives, and all grassroots organizations. I believe that this is a further expansion of democratic life. Judging from the development of the current situation, this policy has played a fairly good role, but there are still some problems. The first is worry. Everyone, of course, understands the principles of "knowing everything and saying everything" and "the speaker is not guilty, and the listener should take it as a warning," but it is not easy to implement. To use a perhaps inappropriate analogy, it is not easy to be Emperor Taizong, and it is even more difficult to be Wei Zheng. To be Emperor Taizong, one must have a high degree of political cultivation and be difficult to be modest; to be Wei Zheng, one must have a high degree of loyalty to the people's cause and be more susceptible to slander and fear of criticism. I think that there may be many cadres at all levels in the Party who are like Emperor Taizong, but there are still too few outside the Party who are like Wei Zheng. The second is not understanding the facts, making it difficult to offer criticisms and suggestions. Without investigation and research, there is no right to speak. Indeed, if one does not understand the truth of the matter and makes comments casually, it is tantamount to shooting without a target, and one may suffer from the problem of one-sidedness. Therefore, I feel that within the scope of possibility, some facts and data should be provided for consultation and discussion with the masses. If we do not engage in some small democracy or small democracy in these places, it will be troublesome when it turns into a big democracy.

What I mean by saying this is not to say that our democratic life in our new China is not rich. On the contrary, it is precisely because we have full democratic rights, and even more because our people's democratic regime is enthusiastically supported by the people of the whole country, that we can examine and correct difficulties and shortcomings as soon as we discover them. Compared with the false democracy of capitalist countries, our democratic life is much more real and much richer, with an essential difference; compared with the reactionary rule of old China, there is an even greater difference. In addition to people's congresses at all levels, we also have political consultative conferences at all levels. We have opportunities to promote democracy in all institutions, all organizations, all schools, all enterprises, and all agricultural cooperatives. Of course, this does not mean that our democracy is already perfect and flawless. The question today is not whether we have a rich democratic life, but how to make our democratic life more expanded and richer. Originally, the scope of democratic life and the way it is embodied are not fixed or immutable. Our socialist construction is progressing every day, the living standards and political awareness of the people are improving every day, the scope of our democratic life should adapt to the development of the situation and continue to expand, and the way of our democratic life should continue to improve. Take the committees of the People's Political Consultative Conference at all levels as an example. As a way to strengthen unity, mutual supervision, and embody democratic life, this institution is constantly expanding its scope of activities and enriching its work content. I firmly believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our socialist construction will surely move from victory to greater victory; our democratic life will surely become increasingly rich and wonderful; even if there are new contradictions, difficulties, and shortcomings, we will surely be able to overcome them. Let us all dare to face contradictions and constantly strive to solve them, forge ahead bravely, and build our great motherland!

    我们的民主生活一定日趋丰富美满
    王造时谈克服官僚主义、进行互相监督与扩大民主生活的问题
    听了周总理访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告，与国际形势的发展相印证，我深深感到这次访问对于亚洲各国的团结、社会主义各国的团结及一切爱好和平的国家和人民的团结，都作了不可估量的贡献，也就是对于反殖民主义的斗争和保卫世界和平的运动发生了广泛深远的影响，使我国在国际上获得了更高的声望和更重要的地位。因此，我对于周总理的为国宣劳表示最诚挚的敬意。
    这次我有机会能够听到毛主席在最高国务会议的扩大会议所作关于如何处理人民内部关系的英明指示，特别感到欣幸。这些指示对于国家生活的日趋完善和社会主义建设事业的迅速发展，将起决定性的作用。我受到了很大的启示和无限的鼓舞。在这种启示和鼓舞下，现在我来谈谈克服官僚主义、进行互相监督与扩大民主生活的问题。
    我们中国好不容易在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，终于打倒了封建主义、赶走了帝国主义、消灭了官僚资本主义，并从半封建、半殖民地的落后基地，建立起社会主义社会的大厦。这是人类历史上的伟大事业，但决不是容易的事业。在建立社会主义事业的过程当中，自然免不了要发生一些新的矛盾、新的困难和新的缺点。我们应该正视它们，而不应该自满于已获得的伟大成就而忽视它们。我觉得，我们一手应该拿着望远镜来高瞻远瞩，看清大势的趋向，肯定主要的成就，比照过去的落后，展望未来的远景，从而使我们满怀信心，向社会主义前途迈进，不致因为个别的、局部的、暂时的迂回曲折而感到迷惑；另一手应该拿着显微镜来发现我们工作中的矛盾、困难和缺点，或在未形成的时候加以预防，或在萌芽的时候加以消除，或在已发生问题的时候加以解决，以免由无变有，由小变大，招致不需要的损失。毛主席指示我们：敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾可以转化；人民内部矛盾关系，如果处理得不好，也可能转化为敌我矛盾关系。
    怎样能把人民内部矛盾关系处理得好，首先就必须克服官僚主义。官僚主义本来是封建主义和资本主义的产物，不过社会主义如果中了它的遗毒而不加以肃清，那么它所造成的损失和带来的危害就特别来得大了。因为在我们社会主义国家里面，政府活动的范围越来越广，政府管理的事情越来越繁，政府的权力越来越大，政府的机构越来越庞杂，政府的工作人员越来越增多。政府与人民生活的各方面，处处都要发生密切的关系。我们吃饭、穿衣、住房、走路和娱乐，都与政府的设施有关。从我们还没有出生的时候到我们死了以后都无法超政治。譬如，提倡节育就是有关出生以前的事情，提倡火葬就是死亡以后的问题。政府是在那里全心全意为人民服务，但不是，也不可能，件件事情都办好了。我们应该要求事情办得好些，错误犯得少些。因为如果决定一个措施有错误，或执行一个措施有偏差，人民所遭受的损害可就大了。举例来说，如果政府有关部门不提倡养猪，人民就要少吃猪肉；如果事前调查研究设计不好，就要造成几十万部双轮双铧犁的浪费；如果不熟悉经营鸡鸭的业务，就有大批的死亡；如果不注意草纸的生产，那就连草纸也要发生恐慌。
    但是什么是官僚主义？倒不容易给它下一个定义。它的表现或许有这么几点。第一，不走群众路线；也就是不深入群众，不相信群众，不依靠群众；眼睛望上不望下，只知体会上级的意旨，不倾听下面的呼声，不反映群众的意见，因而脱离群众，在感情上和生活上与群众的距离越来越远。第二，喜欢报喜不报忧。于是“看颜色说话，看菩萨打卦”，悦耳之言越来越多，逆耳之言越来越少。结果是偏听偏信，不了解全面，以致专断行事，造成错误。第三，奉行故事，不问效果；但求无过，不求有功；责任能推卸便推卸，不能推卸便敷衍。至于摆架子，摆排场，犹其余事。如果拿这样的作风去对待工作，工作又如何能够做好。
    党中央和毛主席有鉴于此，为防微杜渐，特于去年宣布了长期共存、互相监督的政策。这虽然主要指的是党派间的关系，但我希望将它扩充到各人民团体、各机关、各企业、各农业合作社及各基层组织中去。我体会，这是民主生活进一步的扩大。照发展到目前的情形来看，这个政策已起了相当好的作用，但也还存在一些问题。第一是有顾虑。“知无不言，言无不尽”和 “言者无罪，闻者足戒”的道理，大家当然懂得，实行却不太容易。拿一个或许是不伦不类的比喻来说，做唐太宗固然不易，做魏征更难。做唐太宗的非有高度的政治修养，难得虚怀若谷；做魏征的非对人民事业有高度的忠诚，更易忧谗畏讥。我想，现在党内各级干部中像唐太宗的可能很多，党外像魏征的倒还嫌其少。第二是不了解事实，很难提出批评和建议。不经过调查研究，没有发言权。的确，如果不明白问题的真相，而随便提意见，等于无的放矢，就可能患片面的毛病。因此，我觉得在可能范围内，应该提供一些事实和资料，与群众协商讨论。如果在这些地方，不搞些小民主或者小小民主，那么等到闹成大民主就麻烦了。
    我说这番话的意思，并不是说在我们新中国里我们的民主生活不丰富。恰恰相反，正是由于我们有充分的民主权利，更由于我们的人民民主政权得到全国人民的热烈拥护，我们才可能一发现有困难和缺点就加以检讨和纠正。与资本主义国家的假民主比较，我们的民主生活要真实得多，丰富得多，有本质上的不同；如果与旧中国的反动统治比较，那更有天渊之别了。我们除有各级人民代表大会以外，还有各级政治协商委员会。我们在各机关里、各团体里、各学校里、各企业里、各农业合作社里，都有发扬民主的机会。当然这不等于说我们的民主已经尽善尽美，圆满无缺。今天的问题不在于我们有没有丰富的民主生活，而在于如何使我们的民主生活更加扩大，更加丰富。本来民主生活的范围及其体现的方式不是固定的、一成不变的。我们的社会主义建设天天在进展，人民的生活水平和政治觉悟天天在提高，我们的民主生活的范围也就应该适应形势的发展而随着不断扩大，我们的民主生活的方式也就应该随着不断改进。就拿人民政治协商会议各级委员会来说，作为一个加强团结、互相监督及体现民主生活的方式，这个机构是不断在扩大它的活动范围，丰富它的工作内容。我深信，在共产党和毛主席的领导下，我们的社会主义建设一定由胜利走向更大的胜利；我们的民主生活一定日趋丰富美满；即使有新的矛盾、困难和缺点，我们也一定能够加以克服。让我们大家都在敢于正视矛盾，并不断努力解决矛盾的过程中，奋勇前进，建设我们伟大的祖国！
