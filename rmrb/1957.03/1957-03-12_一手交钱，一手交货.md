    Cash on Delivery
    In the past, when residents of Fuzhou went to the grain store to buy a pound of grain, they had to go through five procedures: verification, recording the household account, issuing a slip, collecting payment, and dispensing the grain. Because there were so many procedures, work efficiency was low, resulting in queues and congestion for the masses. Recently, the Fifth Grain Store in Taijiang District and the Twelfth Store in Cangshan began to use the "cash on delivery" method. This not only eliminated the phenomenon of queuing but also saved manpower and facilitated the masses. Now, more than one hundred grain stores in Fuzhou have adopted this method, which is very popular with the masses. They say: "Now buying rice no longer requires passing 'five checkpoints'."

    一手交钱，一手交货
    过去福州市居民到粮店买一斤粮食，都要经过验证、记分户账、发单、收款、付粮等五道手续。因为手续多，工作效率低，造成了群众的排队和拥挤。最近，台江区第五粮店和仓山第十二店开始采用“一手收钱，一手付货”的办法后，不但消灭了排队现象，而且也节省了人力，便利了群众。现在福州市的一百多个粮店，都采用了这个办法，群众非常欢迎。他们说：“现在买米再也不要过‘五关’了。”
