Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Beijing—The number of mass-run, privately operated daycare organizations in Beijing has grown to over 1,100. There are 75 private maternity and child care stations. The characteristics of these maternity and child care organizations are: low cost, simple organization, and great popularity with mothers.

These mass-run nursery organizations are distributed throughout the city and have already taken in more than 72,000 children between the ages of two and seven. With the exception of a small number of nursery organizations that receive small government subsidies, most of them started from scratch. The staff in the nurseries are mostly housewives who are enthusiastic about children's education. In the beginning, they hardly took any wages, so the fees were more than half cheaper than full boarding. The food fee for children at the Dongzhimen Avenue Kindergarten is only six yuan, but the 50-year-old woman, Ding Xipei, can make all kinds of dishes to suit the children's tastes, with changes in the dishes and rice every day. This old lady has been selected as a model cook in Beijing.

The staff of the maternity and child care stations are all midwives who used to be in private practice or were not in practice. Now, after being organized, they are responsible for maternity and child care work in their respective areas. According to incomplete statistics, last year they performed more than 450,000 prenatal examinations, delivered 5,665 babies at home, and made more than 23,000 postpartum visits. Prenatal examination outpatient visits cost only five cents each, delivery costs four to six yuan per delivery, and postpartum visits are free of charge. They often go out at night to deliver babies, and they go whenever the family asks, which makes mothers feel very convenient.

    北京民办妇幼保健和托儿组织
    很受广大母亲的欢迎
    据新华社讯　北京市群众自办的日间托儿组织已发展到一千一百多处。私人组织起来的妇幼保健站已有七十五处。这些妇幼保健组织的特点是：花钱少，组织简单，很受母亲们的欢迎。
    这种群众自办的托儿组织分布在市内各地，已经收托了两岁到七岁的儿童七万两千多名。除部分托儿组织得到政府少量补助外，一般都是空手起家的。在托儿所内的工作人员，大都是些热心儿童教育的家庭妇女。开始时她们差不多全不拿工资，因此收费比全托要便宜一半还多。东直门大街幼儿园孩子的伙食费只六元，五十多岁的老太太丁锡佩却能做出各种适合孩子口味的菜来，每一天的菜、饭都有变化。这个老太太已被选为北京市的模范炊事员。
    妇幼保健站的工作人员都是过去私人开业或未开业的助产士，现在组织起来后，分别负责自己地段内的妇幼保健工作。据不完全统计，去年一年中，她们共作孕期检查四十五万多次，在家接产五千六百六十五次，作产后访视两万三千多次。孕期检查门诊每次只收五分钱，接产一次收费四元到六元，产后访视不收费用。她们经常夜出接生，产家什么时候请，她们就什么时候去，使产妇感到很大方便。
