Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang Electric Dispatch: Farmers in Guizhou Province are actively building farmland water conservancy projects and accumulating fertilizer to accelerate preparations for spring plowing. At present, more than 16,000 small-scale farmland water conservancy projects have been completed or are under construction throughout the province. When these projects are completed, they can expand the irrigation area by more than 1.1 million mu, accounting for half of the annual water conservancy construction plan. This year, the province plans to accumulate 5,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of cultivated land, and this plan has now generally been completed by about 40%.

In this mountainous province, farmland not only lacks water sources, but also has thin soil, so building farmland water conservancy and accumulating large amounts of fertilizer are crucial for increasing agricultural production. In the construction of farmland water conservancy projects, farmers have learned from last year's lessons and paid attention to quality. Therefore, the water conservancy projects that have been completed in various places can generally guarantee farmland water use for more than 40 consecutive days of drought, and the drought resistance capacity has increased by more than 10 days compared with last year. The high-temperature composting method, which has been adopted by farmers throughout the province for many years, has also been further improved this year. Farmers in Panxi Township, Sinan County, added cow dung to the compost, which rotted weeds into very good fine fertilizer.

In order to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year, farmers in various places have put forward the slogan of ensuring "sufficient water and full fertilizer," striving to accumulate 5,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of paddy field before spring plowing, and dry land should also reach more than 2,500 jin. This year, the province requires the completion of 90% of the water conservancy plan to irrigate 2.3 million mu of farmland by the end of April. After the completion of these water conservancy projects, about 70% of the province's farmland irrigation will be guaranteed.

### 贵州积极兴修水利准备春耕

　　贵州积极兴修水利准备春耕
    据新华社贵阳电　贵州省的农民正在兴修农田水利和积极积肥，加紧准备春耕。目前全省各地完工和正在施工的小型农田水利工程达一万六千多处，这些工程全部完工后可扩大灌溉面积一百一十多万亩，占全年兴修水利计划的半数。今年全省计划每亩耕地要积肥五千斤，这个计划，现在一般已完成40％左右。
    在这个多山的省份、农田不仅缺乏水源，而且土质也比较瘦薄，因而兴修农田水利和大量积肥对农业增产具有决定性的作用。在兴修农田水利工程中，农民们吸取了去年的教训，都很注意质量。因此，目前各地完工的水利工程，一般都可以保证连旱四十多天的农田用水，抗旱能力比去年增加十多天。连年来全省农民采用最多的高温堆肥方法，今年也进一步改进了技术。思南县潘溪乡农民在堆肥中放了牛粪，使野草腐烂成很好的细肥。
    为力争今年农业大丰收，现在各地农民提出了保证做到“水足，肥饱”的口号，争取在春耕前为每亩水田积肥五千斤，旱地也要达到二千五百斤以上。今年全省要求兴修可灌二百三十万亩农田的水利计划，也将在4月底以前完成90％。这些水利工程全部完工后，全省将有70％左右的农田灌溉有了保证。
