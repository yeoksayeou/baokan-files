My thinking has been greatly enlightened by Chairman Mao's speech at the Eleventh Enlarged Supreme State Conference.

Chairman Mao said that people's mouths have two functions, one is to speak, and the other is to eat. It is not permissible to only allow eating and not allow speaking. I think this is very accurate. Because, for the people, we should not only allow them to speak, but also actively encourage them to speak. Only in this way can we know more about the people's reactions and demands, and the policies and guidelines of the Party and the government can better meet the people's needs and conform to the people's interests. The purpose of this conference in proposing "Say all you know, say everything without reservation" is precisely to encourage us to express more opinions.

An ancient book says: "Preventing the people's mouths is more dangerous than preventing a river; if a river is blocked, it will burst and injure many people." This is a very vivid illustration. Rivers must be dredged regularly to maintain smooth flow. Contradictions that occur among the people must be eliminated in a timely manner to ensure closer unity among the people. The process of social progress is also the process of resolving contradictions. With the continuous progress of society and the changing objective conditions, some contradictions may also arise among the people. But these contradictions are not antagonistic contradictions and can be resolved. Encouraging people to speak more, adopting their correct opinions, explaining one-sided views, and correcting incorrect opinions is like dredging a river, a method of resolving contradictions among the people. It is conducive to the unity of the people and to the socialist construction of our country. On the other hand, incorrect ideas can only be known, criticized, and corrected by others if they are spoken out. It's like grass roots, not easily discovered when buried in the mud, but easily uprooted when the stems are seen. One of the purposes of the government's proposal of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" lies in this. The process of "contending" is actually a process of struggle between right and wrong, and the result will be that the correct ones will be developed and the incorrect ones will be eliminated.

Regarding "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom," I also have the following experiences:

(1) Letting a hundred flowers bloom is conducive to the development of academics. This can be clearly seen in history. In ancient times, "academic knowledge was in the hands of officials, and the people could not see it." Therefore, science could not develop rapidly. It was not until the Warring States period that "books in official collections were scattered, and outstanding scholars each obtained one subject to make a name for themselves." At that time, there were so-called Nine Schools, also known as the Nine Streams. The Nine Streams were further divided into a hundred schools, such as "after Laozi came Zhuang and Lie, and after Confucius came Zeng, Si, and Meng," etc. From this, we can see the prosperity of academic development at that time. Among the hundred schools, Mozi was the most prominent, with many branches. Although "he was refuted by Mencius, and the Historical Records did not write a biography for him," Han Yu in the Tang Dynasty still referred to Confucius and Mozi as equals. Many people still study his books today. Mozi's proposition starts from materialism, and there are many records about science in his works. His propositions of anti-fatalism, simple burials, anti-aggression, and emphasis on conformity still have some aspects that can be adopted today.

In ancient times, the contention of a hundred schools sometimes led to the phenomenon of "confused words." Now, with the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, and the people's ability to discern has been greatly improved through years of education by the Party, advocating the contention of a hundred schools under such conditions will be more beneficial and without the disadvantages of "confused words."

(2) In the past, those who "鳴" (míng - chirped/spoke) might not be heard, but now we must not only "鳴" (míng - chirp/speak) but also "鳴" (míng - chirp/speak) loudly. If it is not loud enough, we can "鳴" (míng - chirp/speak) again. We should have the confidence to adhere to the truth.

(3) In the past, there was little "鳴" (míng - chirping/speaking) and even less harmony. Now we should make more "鳴" (míng - chirping/speaking) and even more harmony, and learn from each other. In the past, there was little debate in academia. In the future, we should promote discussions in academia to make the original content more substantial, more accurate, and more colorful.

(4) The contention of a hundred schools is not limited to domestic scholars, and we should also contend with international scholars. We must learn from everything that is more advanced than us, but we must also have the ability to critically receive, and not blindly "accept everything."

(5) One must become a master before one can "鳴" (míng - chirp/speak). The government has done a lot of work in this regard. It has convened well-known scholars from all over the country to discuss and formulate China's Twelve-Year Science Development Plan. The government has given special care to senior intellectuals so that they can concentrate on in-depth research in their respective fields. Many scientific research institutions have been established throughout the country. These provide good conditions for people who are "becoming masters." Our senior intellectuals will certainly not disappoint the expectations of the country and will work hard to develop and improve China's scientific level.

    关于“百家争鸣”的几点体会
    沙彦楷的发言
    毛主席在第十一次扩大最高国务会议上的讲话对我思想上有很大启发。
    毛主席说人的口有两种作用，一是说话，一是吃饭，不能只准吃饭而不准说话。我认为是十分准确的。因为对于人民内部不但应该让他们说话，而且应该积极的鼓励他们说话。只有这样才能知道更多人民的反映和要求，党和政府的政策方针才能更好的满足人民的要求和符合于人民的利益。这次会议提出“知无不言，言无不尽”的目的亦正是为了鼓励我们多发表意见。
    古书说：“防民之口，甚于防川，川壅而溃，伤人必多。”这是很形象化的说明。河道必须经常加以疏浚，才能经常保持畅通。人民内部发生的矛盾必须及时予以消除，才能保证人民内部更紧密的团结。社会的进展过程亦就是矛盾解决的过程。随着社会的不断进展，客观环境条件的改变，有时在人民内部亦可能产生一些矛盾。但这些矛盾不是对抗性的矛盾，是可以解决的。鼓励人民多说话，采纳其对的意见，对片面的看法加以解释，对不正确的意见加以纠正，这就好像疏通河道一样，是一个解决人民内部矛盾的方法。有利于人民内部的团结，有利于我国社会主义建设事业。另一方面，不正确的思想亦只有谈出来了，别人才能知道、才能帮助批判和改正它。这好像草根一样，埋在泥中不易发现，看到了草茎才易于连根拔除。政府提出“百家争鸣”的目的之一就在于此。“争鸣”的过程实际上是对的与不对的之间的斗争过程，结果将使正确的得到发展，不正确的得以消除。
    关于“百家争鸣”我尚有下列体会：
    （1）百家争鸣有利于学术的发展，这在历史上可以明显的看出。古代“学术在官，民间所不能见。”因此科学不可能迅速的发展。直到战国“官中图书尽散，杰出之士各得其一科以自名其家。”当时有所谓九家又称为九流，九流又分出百家，如“老子之后有庄列，孔子之后有曾思孟”等。由此可以看出当时学术发展之盛。在百家中尤以墨子最称大家，支派极多，虽“为孟子所辟，史记又不为立传。”但到唐代韩愈尚以孔墨并称，其书直到现在还是有很多人研究它。墨子的主张是从唯物出发，在他的著作中有很多关于科学方面的记载。他的非命、薄葬、非攻、尚同等主张在现在仍然有一部分可以取法的。
    在古代的百家争鸣有时发生“群言淆乱”的现象，而现在已经有了马列主义的指导，另一方面人民群众在几年来党的教育下识别能力已经大大提高了。在这样的条件下提倡百家争鸣将能更收其利，而无
  “群言淆乱”之弊。
    （2）从前鸣的未必能响，而现在不但要“鸣”而且要“鸣”得响，不响可以再鸣。我们应该要有坚持真理的信心。
    （3）从前鸣得少，和的更少。现在应使鸣的多，和的更多，互相切磋。从前在学术上很少争论，今后应该提倡在学术上展开讨论，以使原有的内容更充实，更准确，更多彩。
    （4）百家争鸣不仅限于国内，并且应当与国际上的学者争鸣，我们要向一切比我们先进的学习，但亦要有批判接收的能力，不能盲目的“照单全收”。
    （5）学必成家而后才能鸣。政府在这方面作了很多工作。曾经召集了全国著名学者讨论并制订了我国十二年科学发展计划，政府对高级知识分子特别加以照顾，使能专心一志的深入钻研其本门业务。全国已成立了很多的科学研究机构。这些都为“成家”的人提供了良好条件。我们的高级知识分子也一定不会辜负国家的期望，为发展和提高我国的科学水平而努力的工作。
