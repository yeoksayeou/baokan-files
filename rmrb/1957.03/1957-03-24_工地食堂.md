　　Construction Site Canteen
　　By Our Reporter Lin Mo
    In the new industrial zone of Baotou, I visited a canteen of the First Engineering Department of the North China Baotou Engineering Corporation. A worker from Tianjin said, "Of course, this place is starting from scratch, and conditions are difficult. How can it be compared to big cities in every aspect? But in terms of food, I think it's even better than there. The food is good, and it costs less. The workers are very satisfied! — Haven't you heard? We have a good canteen here."
    I had heard many comments about this canteen.
    Some said: A construction site canteen that feeds two or three thousand people can still make steamed buns and dumplings for you regularly! The meals are more complete than in restaurants! Have you ever seen that? — Even more rare is that a dish costing five cents can be made into dozens of different varieties. Our cooks are truly "clever housewives managing the household," both capable and frugal!
    If anyone is lazy or shirking at the construction site, people will say: Are you worthy of our cooks? Go and see how our cooks live!
    An old worker said: "I've been in the construction industry, eating construction site food, for at least thirty years, and this is the first time I've encountered such a canteen. In the past, workers going to construction sites all carried their own bowls and chopsticks; when it was time to get off work for meals, ten or eight people gathered around, with a bucket of boiling water, a basket of steamed buns, and a basin of vegetables, squatting on the ground to eat. In recent years, we have canteens, and the variety of food has also increased. — Speaking of canteens, there were also some troubling things: there were many people eating, and the time was short. When the electric bell rang, they wouldn't sell food anymore. To make it in time for meals, some people would secretly leave work early. In our canteen, you can still get food when you get off work in the middle of the night (there are people on duty); if the construction site is far away, the cooks will even deliver food."
    At lunchtime, I walked into this construction site canteen. All the workers, staff, technicians, and enterprise management cadres of the entire engineering department eat here. There is a row of more than a dozen food-selling windows. The characteristic of this canteen is that it has both the economical meals welcomed by ordinary workers and higher-quality dishes.
    I approached a table where several young technicians were eating. They were probably a "dining combination" that had been arranged in advance. Each person ordered different dishes, including braised oxtail, stir-fried rape with pork, fermented bean curd, dried shrimp with braised cabbage, quick-fried liver, shrimp with braised dried bean curd, and braised chicken. It was truly a well-rounded table with both meat and vegetables. They said that eating such meals would cost a person only six or seven dimes a day.
    Ordinary workers eat differently. Some thrifty ones eat yellow cornbread and bean porridge, spending a few cents on two dishes of pickles. Some eat a good meal every few days, ordering a large plate of pancakes or steamed buns. More common is the five-cent Category C dish, but even those come in different varieties: there is a large bowl of stew, as well as "fried lotus root sandwich," "quick-fried liver," and "stir-fried dried scallop threads"... Later, when talking to the cooks, I learned that these dishes each have their own special features: "Fried lotus root sandwich" is not made with lotus root, but with potatoes peeled, sliced, and pierced with wire, then stuffed with pork skin, bean sprouts, and tofu, rolled in batter, and deep-fried. "Quick-fried liver" is made by steaming naked oat noodles, cutting them into small pieces, frying them, and stir-frying them with scallions and seasonings. Although these dishes use coarser ingredients, they taste very good after careful processing and cooking.
    I counted the menu and recipes, filling several blackboards that day, and the number of dishes totaled no less than a hundred. But the administrator Comrade repeatedly explained to me that the variety of dishes had already been reduced due to the lack of winter vegetables (it was January, the freezing cold season).
    After the tour, I asked the administrator, Comrade Liang Shou, why the canteen was so well-run. He smiled modestly and said, "Actually, it's nothing, it's all everyone's efforts; whether the work is good or bad depends on the people, on the people's thoughts."
    "That's right, it depends on the people's thoughts!" The cook, Qiao Jiren, interjected, "Take me for example, in the past I always felt that being a cook was useless, and no one looked up to me. People used to say: 'Singing doesn't sing female roles, working doesn't cook.' I just didn't want to do it, just getting through each day. Back then, we would also look for shortcuts: how to make things easier, potatoes cut into four pieces, boiled in a pot, take it or leave it. Every meal was a pot of steamed buns, a pot of rice, and a big mixed stew of cabbage and radish, as long as it didn't delay the meal time."
    If the cooks didn't love their work, the food wouldn't be good, and there would be complaints in the canteen. Sometimes the workers would argue with the cooks. With such arguing and scolding, the staff became even more dissatisfied, and the cooks were even more full of complaints.
    What to do? Liang Shou consulted with Party and Youth League members. The unanimous opinion was: to gain everyone's respect, the food must be made well first. — The workers work all day, tired and hungry. Seeing the same old food, they would be impatient, how could they treat you kindly?
    Liang Shou often went to the kitchen to help everyone work, talked to the cooks, and enlightened everyone in every way. Yang Benxian, the leader of the third group in the flour products section, had worked in a restaurant in Tianjin in the past. After liberation, his family's life improved, and he praised the new society. When he was cooking, Liang Shou would assist him, persuading him left and right. Master Yang was so happy that he brought out his old skills. That day, the canteen featured sweet rice and flour cornbread, naked oat rolls that locals loved to eat, as well as sugar triangles, meat buns, and steamed twisted rolls... The atmosphere in the canteen was different, everyone was all smiles.
    In fact, Liu Wanxiang from the flour products section had worked in restaurants for more years and had more advanced techniques. He felt it was meaningless to make rice and steamed buns here every day. Now that he saw Yang Benxian doing this, everyone was satisfied, and the leadership praised him, he couldn't hold back any longer, and ran to the administrator to say, "As long as the leadership supports me, we'll do it too!" Liang Shou clapped his hands and welcomed him, saying, "Good, Master Liu! I knew you had some skills, let's do it! If you have any difficulties, come to me." Liang Shou organized people to help him repair the stove and prepare materials. The entire flour products section was mobilized. In less than two days, pancakes, meat pies, sesame cakes, dumplings, and noodles were on the market one after another.
    The great reform in the flour products section caused a sensation in the kitchen. Liang Shou then went to mobilize the Category C vegetable group. At this time, it was the most intense period of the construction project, and many temporary workers had been added to the construction site, with the most people eating Category C dishes in the canteen. That day, the Category C vegetable was stir-fried zucchini, cut into large chunks, and it was more like boiled than stir-fried, and no one liked to eat it. Liang Shou collected a lot of leftovers from the tables and brought them back to the kitchen. He said sadly, "Comrades! Look at this dish, there's more wasted than eaten!"
    The people in the Category C vegetable group had the least confidence in changing the way of cooking. Everyone often said: You get what you pay for, no matter how high the skill, what good dish can be made with five cents' worth of ingredients? But at this time, everyone saw the flour products group making various dishes, and everyone said it was good, but their own dishes were made but no one ate them, and they were also a little anxious. Some said that they didn't eat zucchini like this at home, but cut it into shreds, added bean sprouts, scallions, and seasonings, mixed it with flour, steamed it into balls, and it tasted very good. Some said that in their hometown, they could also use white radish shreds, soybean sprouts, and mung bean flour, fry them into balls, and then add some cabbage and vermicelli to make a ball soup. Everyone talked back and forth, and finally found a way, called "coarse ingredients, fine preparation." Everyone put forward all the methods they had made, eaten, heard of, and thought of, and then discussed and experimented to see which method made the dish both delicious and cheap. After such a fuss, it was still zucchini, cabbage, potatoes, and radish, but using steaming, frying, cooking, and stir-frying methods, dozens of different varieties were made.
    The name of the five-cent dish could be written on a blackboard, and the people eating and cooking said that this had never happened before. The Category A and Category B vegetable groups only had two or three dishes, and they were embarrassed to put up the menu, and they quickly caught up.
    Finally, only breakfast was still the same old thing: steamed buns, rice, and old pickles, and even porridge was not often available. Liang Shou convened a meeting, and Yang Zhenhua said that if he could install a small stone mill, he could make soy milk and old tofu. Jing Yuhua said that with a mill, he could also make almond tea. Liu Wanxiang proposed to make wontons, and he could teach everyone how to make the wrappers. There was also hot and sour soup, fried dough sticks, and eight-treasure rice, all of which were made.
    The canteen launched a heated competition, and the company and the engineering department gave rewards. The Baotou City Federation of Trade Unions also asked them to introduce their experience to the city's employee canteens, and the cook comrades were all elated.
    But at this time, the administrator, Comrade Liang Shou, became worried. He remembered his past experiences: often when a competition started, the food improved, everyone was satisfied, and the leadership unconsciously relaxed, the competition gradually went from a climax to a low ebb, and the food became worse day by day.
    Therefore, when everyone's emotions were high, he calmed down, further looked for shortcomings and loopholes, and guided the enthusiasm of the masses to improve the management system of the canteen in many ways, eliminate waste, and reduce costs.
    The administrator and cooks often sincerely collected opinions from employees to improve the quality and taste of the food. Some temporary workers from the local area said that they had been away from home for a long time and wanted to eat a homely sour rice meal. The cooks ran seven or eight miles to find sour pulp to make sour rice for them. The workers from Hebei Province wanted to eat cornmeal "gaga," and they also tried to make it for them. The workers ate their hometown food and were so happy that they didn't know what to say. Everyone praised: This construction site canteen is really like our home!

　　工地食堂
　　本报记者　林沫
    在包头的新工业区，我访问了华北包头工程总公司第一工程处的一个食堂。一个从天津来的工人说，“当然啦，这地方是平地起家，条件困难，要处处和大城市比怎么能行？可是拿饮食上来说，叫我看比那里都强，吃的又好，花钱又少，职工们最满意不过了！——你没听说吗？咱们这里有个好食堂。”
    关于这个食堂，我曾听到人们的许多评论。
    有的说：两三千人吃饭的工地食堂，还能常给你作包子，捏饺子，饭菜比馆子里都全！你见过吗？——更难得的是，五分钱一份的菜，也能给你作出几十种不同的花样来。咱们的炊事员，真是“巧媳妇过日子”，又能干，又俭省！
    在工地干活，要是有谁偷懒耍滑了，人们会说：对得起咱们的炊事员吗？去瞧瞧咱们的炊事员怎么过日子吧！
    有个老工人说：“干建筑业，吃工地饭，在我少说也有三十年了，遇到这样的食堂，还是头一次。过去工人下工地，人人腰里装上碗筷；说声下工开饭了，十个、八个人一堆，一桶开水，一筐馒头，一盆菜，蹲在地下就吃开了。这几年有了食堂，饭菜样数也多了。——说起食堂，可也有伤脑筋的事：吃饭人多，时间又短，到时候电铃一响，有饭也不卖了。为了赶吃饭时间，有的人就偷着提前下班。在咱们食堂，你半夜下班也有饭吃（有专人值班）；工地离的远了，还有炊事员给送饭去。”
    吃午饭的时候，我走进这个工地食堂。全工程处的工人、职员、技术人员和企业管理干部都在这里吃饭，一排有十几个卖饭的窗口。这个食堂的特点是，既有一般职工所欢迎的经济饭菜，又有质量较高的菜肴。
    我走近一张饭桌，在这张桌子上吃饭的是几个青年技术人员。他们大概是事先联络好的“吃饭组合”。各人要的菜都不同，有红烧牛尾、油菜炒肉、南乳豆腐、海米烧白菜、溜肝尖、虾子烧腐竹、黄焖鸡，真是晕素齐全，凑在一起是很好的一桌。他们说，吃这样的饭菜，一个人每天有六、七毛钱足够了。
    一般工人的吃法又不同。有的俭省的，吃的是黄窝窝头、豆稀饭，花几分钱要两碟小菜。有的隔几天吃上顿好的，就要一大盘烙饼或包子。更多的是五分钱一份的丙种菜，但也样样不同：有大碗烩菜，还有“炸藕夹”、“溜肝尖”、“炒干贝丝”……。后来和炊事员谈起来，才知道这些菜各有讲究：“炸藕夹”并不是用藕作的，而是把土豆去了皮，切成片，再用铁丝打了眼，夹上肉皮、豆芽、豆腐，滚上面糊，过油炸的。“溜肝尖”原来是把莜面上锅蒸了，切成碎块，油炸了，放上葱花、调料炒出来的。这些菜虽然原料粗些，但经过细致地加工烹调，吃起来也很好。
    我统计了当天写满几个黑板的菜单、食谱，饭菜的名目总共不下百种。但管理员同志还一再向我说明，因为冬季蔬菜缺乏（这时正是寒天冻地的一月），菜的花样已经减少了。
    参观之后，我问管理员梁守同志，为什么能把食堂办得这么好？他谦虚地笑了笑说：“其实也没啥，都是大家的努力；工作好坏，都在人，在乎人的思想。”
    “这话说的对，就在乎人的思想！”坐在旁边的炊事员乔吉仁接口说：“就以我来说吧，过去我总觉得当炊事员没出息，谁也瞧不起。过去人常说：‘唱戏不唱旦，干活不作饭。’我就是不愿干，混一天算一天。那时候我们也找窍门：怎么省事怎么干，土豆一切四块，放锅里一煮，爱吃不吃。顿顿是一锅馒头，一锅饭，白菜萝卜大杂烩，只要不误开饭就行。”
    炊事员不热爱自己的工作，饭菜作的不好，食堂里一片怨言，有时工人就和炊事员吵起来了。这么一吵一骂呵！职工更不满意了，炊事员更是满腹牢骚。
    怎么办呢？梁守找党、团员来商量。大家一致的意见是：要得到众人的尊重，必须先把饭菜作好。——工人干了一天活，又累又饿，看见那老一套的饭菜，就不耐烦，还能好言相待吗？
    梁守常下厨房帮大家干活，和炊事员谈心，处处启发大家。面食第三组的组长杨本贤，过去在天津的饭馆里干过。解放后，他一家人的生活过好了，口口赞扬新社会。作饭的时候，梁守去给他当帮手，左说，右劝，杨师傅心眼里一高兴，把他的老本事拿出来了。那天，食堂里出现了甜丝丝的米面窝窝头，当地人爱吃的莜面卷，还有糖三角、肉包子、花卷……。食堂里气色不同了，个个喜笑颜开。
    其实，面食组的刘万祥在饭馆里干的年数更多，技术更高明。在这里天天作些米饭、馒头，自己也觉得没意思。现在见杨本贤这么干了，大家满意，领导上表扬，他再也忍不住了，就跑去找管理员说：“只要领导上撑腰，咱们也干！”梁守拍手欢迎说：“好，刘师傅！我早就知道你有两下子，干吧！有什么困难你找我。”梁守就组织人帮他修炉灶，准备材料，面食组全体大动员。不两天，烙饼、馅饼、芝麻烧饼、饺子、面条，一样接着一样上市了。
    面食组的大革新哄动了厨房。梁守又去发动丙菜组。这时正是建筑工程最紧张的时候，工地添了许多临时工，食堂里吃丙种菜的人最多。那天，丙菜是炒西胡芦，切的大块大块的，说是炒菜，同煮的也差不多，谁也不爱吃。梁守从饭桌上收拾了很多剩菜，拿回厨房，他难过地说：“同志们！看这菜，吃的还没蹧蹋的多呵！”
    做菜变花样，丙菜组的人最没信心。大家常说：一分价钱一分货，手艺再高，五分钱的材料，还能作出什么好菜来？但这时大家见面食组作出花样，人人说好，自己的菜作出来却没人吃，也有些着急了。有人说，他们自己家里吃西胡芦，可不是这么吃，而是把它切成丝，加上豆芽、葱花、调料，和上面，蒸成丸子，吃起来就满好。有的说，在他们家乡，还可以用白萝卜丝、黄豆芽和上绿豆面，炸成丸子，再加些白菜、粉条、作成丸子汤。大家扯来扯去，终于找出了一条办法，叫作“粗菜细作”。每人都把自己作过的、吃过的、听人说过的和现在想出的办法，统统提出来，再讨论、实验，看那种办法作出的菜，既好吃，又便宜。经过这么一闹，还是西胡芦、白菜、土豆、萝卜那几种材料，用蒸、炸、烹、炒的办法，却作出几十种不同的花样来。
    五分钱的菜，菜名能写上一黑板，吃饭和做饭的人都说，这是从来没有过的事。甲菜和乙菜组的菜还只有两三样，他们自己也不好意思把菜牌挂出来，很快也就赶上来了。
    最后，只有早餐还是老一套：馒头、米饭、老咸菜，连稀饭都不常有。梁守召集大家一开会，杨镇华说，如果能安上一盘小磨，他能作豆浆和老豆腐。景玉华说，有了磨，也能作杏仁茶。刘万祥提出，要包馄饨，他可以教大家赶皮。还有酸辣汤、炸油条、八宝饭，一样一样都作出来了。
    食堂开展了热烈的竞赛，公司和工程处给以奖励，包头市工会又请他们向全市的职工食堂介绍经验，炊事员同志个个兴高采烈。
    但这时，管理员梁守同志却担心起来。他想起过去多次的经历：往往是竞赛起来，伙食改善，大家心满意足，领导上无形中一放松，竞赛逐渐从高潮走向低潮，饭菜也就一天不如一天了。
    所以，当大家情绪热烈的时候，他却冷静下来，进一步寻找缺点和漏洞，引导群众的积极性去多方面地改进食堂的管理制度，杜绝浪费，降低成本。
    管理员和炊事员经常诚恳地向职工搜集意见，改进饭菜的质量和口味。有些当地来的临时工说，他们离开家很久了，就想吃上顿家常的酸饭。炊事员就跑七、八里路去找酸浆，给他们作酸饭吃。河北省来的工人想吃玉米面“嘎嘎”，他们也设法给做。工人吃到了家乡饭，乐得不知说什么好，大家赞叹着：这工地食堂，真像咱们的家一样！
