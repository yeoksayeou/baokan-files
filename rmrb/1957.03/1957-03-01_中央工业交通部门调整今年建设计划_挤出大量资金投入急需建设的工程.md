Xinhua News Agency, 28th: A Xinhua News Agency reporter reports: The central industrial and transportation departments, through adjusting this year's construction plans, are making every effort to squeeze out a large amount of funds within the original investment amount to expand and accelerate the construction of factories, mines, and railways. This is an important characteristic of the basic construction plans compiled by various departments this year. A person in charge of the State Economic Commission told reporters: This approach and its basic spirit are worthy of learning by enterprises across the country.

The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has squeezed out tens of millions of yuan. Industrial and transportation departments such as electricity, chemical industry, petroleum, forestry, railways, and transportation have also squeezed out millions or tens of millions of yuan.

The funds squeezed out by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry are planned to be used to accelerate the construction of the No. 1 blast furnace project of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company so that it can be put into production next year; to accelerate the construction of the second continuous rolling steel project of Anshan Iron and Steel, so that this project can be put into production by the end of this year or early next year to meet the needs of steel mills across the country for increasing steel production with small billets. In addition, the ministry will also use part of the funds squeezed out to expand Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and increase investment in non-ferrous metal construction projects. The expansion project of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant was not included in this year's construction plan due to lack of funds. The funds squeezed out by the Ministry of Electric Power Industry can be used to install more than 100,000 kilowatts of power generation equipment this year, which was originally not included in this year's construction plan due to lack of installation costs. After these equipments are put into production, the tense power supply situation in many regions of the country can be basically alleviated. The funds squeezed out by the Ministry of Chemical Industry will be used to accelerate the construction of nitrogen fertilizer plants in Sichuan and Jilin. The funds squeezed out by the Ministry of Petroleum Industry can be used to drill 40,000 meters more of oil wells and exploratory wells. The funds squeezed out by the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Railways, and the Ministry of Forestry Industry have also been invested in urgently needed construction projects.

The main methods used by various departments to squeeze out funds are: reducing investment in non-productive construction or productive construction that does not affect production, or lowering the excessively high design and construction standards of these projects; reducing investment in projects that can be not built or can be postponed; and saving some construction and installation costs by saving building materials and improving the efficiency of construction machinery.

The funds squeezed out by some departments are close to 10% of the department's total annual investment. This raises the possibility of doing 11 billion yuan's worth of work with 10 billion yuan. Some departments are still continuing to rationally adjust their construction plans, preparing to squeeze out more funds.

This year's civil building standards were originally stipulated to be higher than last year, so after appropriately lowering the construction standards for some dormitories, offices, etc., it will not affect their use. However, after various departments have reduced investment in certain projects or lowered construction standards, there are still many specific issues that need to be properly addressed.

    中央工业交通部门调整今年建设计划
    挤出大量资金投入急需建设的工程
    新华社28日讯  新华社记者报道：中央工业交通部门从调整今年建设计划中，在原有投资数内，想尽一切办法，挤出了大量资金，扩大和加速工厂矿山和铁路的建设。这是今年各部门编订基本建设计划的一个重要特征。国家经济委员会负责人对记者说：这种作法及其基本精神，值得全国各企业学习。
    冶金工业部已挤出了几千万元，电力、化工、石油、森林、铁道、交通等工业交通部门，也都挤出了上百万上千万元的资金。
    冶金工业部挤出的资金，计划用来加速武汉钢铁公司一号高炉工程的建设，使其在明年投入生产；加速鞍钢第二连续轧钢工程的建设，使这个工程提前在今年年底或明年初投入生产，以满足全国各轧钢厂增产钢材所需要的小钢坯。另外，这个部还把挤出来的部分资金，用来扩建太原钢厂和增加有色金属建设工程的投资。太原钢厂扩建工程，原来因缺少资金，未列入今年的建设计划。电力工业部挤出的资金，可以把原来因缺乏安装费而不能列入今年建设计划的十几万瓩的发电设备，在今年安装起来，这些设备投入生产以后，全国许多地区供电紧张的情况，可以基本上缓和。化工部挤出的资金，将用来加速四川和吉林氮肥厂的建设。石油工业部挤出的资金，可以多打石油井和探井共四万公尺。交通部、铁道部和森林工业部挤出的资金，也都投入了当前急需建设的工程。
    各部挤出资金的方法主要是：削减非生产性建设或不影响生产的生产性建设的投资，或者降低这些工程过高的设计和建筑标准；削减可以不建或可以缓建的工程的投资；以节省建筑材料提高施工机械效率等方法，节省一些建筑安装费。
    有的部挤出的资金已接近本部全年投资的10％。这就提出了这样一种可能性：用一百亿元，干一百一十亿元的事。现在有的部还正在继续合理地调整建设计划，准备再挤出一些资金。
    今年民用建筑标准，原来规定得比去年高，因此有些宿舍办公室等建筑标准适当降低以后，不致影响使用。但各部削减某些工程投资或降低建筑标准以后，都有不少具体问题，还待妥善处理。
