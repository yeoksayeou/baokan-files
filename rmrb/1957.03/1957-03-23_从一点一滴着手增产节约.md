Increasing Production and Practicing Economy Starts with Small Things

On the production increase and economy practice front in Liaoning Province, many units and individuals are starting from small places, meticulously calculating every detail, and paying attention to saving at all times and in all places, creating wealth for the country.

Don't Underestimate the "Profit" on a Matchstick
The Dalian Match Factory is still short 30% of timber according to its plan this year, but by focusing on improving operations and utilizing substitute materials, the factory's employees can save 2,476 cubic meters of timber throughout the year. This timber can make more than 140 million boxes of matches (including matchboxes), which can fill 95 train carriages. In the past, workers would cut one board (500 mm thick) at a time, often cutting the material off-kilter. Now, with just a small improvement proposed in operation, 97 cubic meters of timber can be saved throughout the year. In the past, small pieces of wood were used for the bottom of matchboxes. Workers proposed using waste paper instead, which can save 49 cubic meters of timber annually.

Not Claiming Nails for Four Months
In the maintenance of mine roadways, nails are indispensable at all times, but if you go to the material warehouse of the Dalian Pit of the Longfeng Mine in Fushun, you won't find any material requisition forms for nail collection from the maintenance team. It turns out that they added thirty "nail pullers" in November of last year, and cadres and workers used them in their spare time to recover nails. Therefore, up to now, they haven't claimed a single nail in four months, saving more than 800 kilograms of nails.

Waste Gas Turns into Useful Material
Workers at the Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory and the Shenyang Chemical Factory are using waste materials to manufacture many useful products. According to statistics from these two units, they can add more than one million yuan of wealth to the country this year.

In the past, the waste sulfuric acid left over from drug production at the Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory was discarded. Later, it was discovered that some waste sulfuric acid could be used as antifreeze and dyes for industrial use, and some waste gas could be used as valuable anesthetics. Currently, twelve successful trials have been conducted, recovering 7,000 tons annually, worth more than 800,000 yuan. The Shenyang Chemical Factory also recovered six kinds of by-products this year. Among them, more than 400 tons of waste chlorine gas were discarded annually in the past. After workers' research, it was made into synthetic hydrochloric acid, which can recover more than 200,000 yuan a year. In addition, there are many production residues such as hydrogenated oil and lime milk, which are now being recovered and made into mechanical lubricating oil, bleaching essence, etc.

A Lathe Bought for Fifteen Yuan
The open hearth mechanical repair section of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works' First Steelmaking Plant only had two lathes in the past, which could not meet the needs of the open hearth for parts. Liu Yongcai, the foreman, once passed by the Anshan Iron and Steel Works' scrap iron factory and saw an old lathe frame in the scrap iron pile. So he spent fifteen yuan to buy it back as scrap steel. With the help of the workers, utilizing discarded materials, piecing together bits and pieces, they finally assembled a complete lathe to produce the parts needed for the open hearth.

### 从一点一滴着手增产节约

　　从一点一滴着手增产节约
    在辽宁省增产节约战线上，有许多单位和个人从细小的地方着手，一点一滴，精打细算，随时随地注意节约，为国家创造了财富。
　  别看火柴杆上“油水”少
    大连火柴厂今年按计划还缺木材30％，但全厂职工从改进操作、利用代用材料上着眼，全年就可以节约木材二千四百七十六立方公尺。这些木柴可以做一亿四千多盒火柴（包括火柴盒），可装九十五个火车厢。过去工人们一次切一板料（五百公厘厚），往往把料切偏了，现在只提出在操作上的细小改进，全年就可节约九十七立方公尺木材。过去，火柴盒底用小木片，工人们提出利用废纸代替，每年可节约木材四十九立方公尺。
    四个月不领钉子
    在矿井巷道维修工作中，时刻离不开用钉子，可是你到抚顺龙凤矿褡连坑材料仓库，却查不出整备班领钉子的领料单。原来他们在去年11月份添了三十把“扒路”，干部和工人们就利用它，在空闲时间去回收钉子。因此，到目前为止，四个月中一根钉子没领。这样就节省了八百多公斤钉子。
    废气体变成有用物
    东北制药厂和沈阳化工厂的工人们，利用废物制造了很多有用的产品。据这两个单位的统计，今年就可为国家增加一百万多元的财富。
    过去，东北制药厂生产药品时所剩下的废硫酸都被扔掉了，后来发现有的废硫酸可做工业上用的防冻剂和染料，有的废气体可做贵重的麻醉剂。仅目前试验成功的就有十二项，全年可回收七千吨，价值八十多万元。沈阳化工厂今年回收的副产品也有六种，其中废氯气过去一年就要扔掉四百多吨，经过工人们研究，把它制成合成盐酸，一年可收回二十多万元。除此以外，还有许多生产剩下的氢油、石灰乳等，现在也设法把它回收起来，制成机械润滑油、漂白精等。
    十五元钱买来的车床
    鞍钢第一炼钢厂平炉机械修理工段过去只有二台车床，一直不能满足供应平炉对零件的需要。工长刘永财一次路过鞍钢碎铁厂时，见碎铁堆中有一台破旧的车床骨架，于是花了十五元把它当废钢铁买了回来。在工人的合力帮助下，利用废弃物资，东拼西凑，终于装配成一台完整的车床，生产平炉需要的零件。　（天申辑）
