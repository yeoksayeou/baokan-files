Xinhua News Agency, New York, 27th: American economist and international monetary expert Franz Pick recently analyzed the harm caused by post-war American inflation to the dollar in a special research material on the devaluation of the dollar. Pick pointed out that if the purchasing power of the dollar in 1939-1941 is taken as 100, then the current domestic purchasing power of the dollar has decreased by more than 50% compared with pre-war levels. If January 1946 is taken as the base, the domestic purchasing power of the dollar in December 1956 also decreased by 29%. Pick drew the following five conclusions based on the extent of the dollar's devaluation:

　　1. The deposits of American banks in 1956 were 33% more than in 1946 when calculated at face value, but only 1.1% higher when calculated in terms of 1946 purchasing power.

　　2. From 1946 to 1956, the bank deposits per person increased by 16% when calculated in paper dollars; but when calculated in terms of 1946 purchasing power units, such deposits decreased by nearly 16% (during this period, the U.S. population increased from 141.2 million in 1946 to 169.4 million in 1956).

　　3. The absolute number of banknotes issued increased by 6%, from 29 billion US dollars in 1946 to 30.8 billion US dollars in November 1956. However, in terms of purchasing power, the value of currency decreased by more than 24% during the same period. Per person, the currency in circulation decreased by more than 11% at face value, while per person currency circulation decreased by no less than 35% when calculated at 1946 values.

　　4. Per person, the gross national product increased by only 16% when calculated in terms of 1946 purchasing power, while it increased by 63% in terms of monetary face value.

　　5. Gold showed a "paradoxical" depreciation. Calculated in terms of the purchasing power of the dollar, the price of gold fell from $35 an ounce in 1946 to the current $24.85. Therefore, in 1946, the "face value" of American gold reserves was equal to $20.7 billion, while in November 1956 it was $22 billion. This is an increase of 6%. But in terms of the purchasing power of the 1946 dollar, this gold was actually worth only $15.6 billion.

　　Pick believes that there are two ways to deal with the devaluation of the dollar. The first is to continue to devalue at a rate that reduces purchasing power by 3% to 4% per year so that the current so-called "paper money boom" in the United States can continue for another year or two. But he pointed out that after this period, the dollar's ability to devalue will accelerate the destruction of assets, hyperinflation will begin to take effect, and currency devaluation will become inevitable. The second method is to tighten the currency supply, keep the currency value unchanged, and generally maintain it at the current purchasing power level. However, he pointed out that adopting such a method will cause "a period of unemployment."

Xinhua News Agency, New York, 26th (TASS): The American trade union newspaper "Labor Daily" published a conversation with Mary Drake, a female staff member of the "Green" trading company. When asked what she thought of America's economic prosperity, she said: "This has nothing to do with us." Her weekly income is 24 US dollars, while the official minimum living expense is 86 US dollars per week. In the United States, a considerable portion of workers are in the same situation as Mary Drake. According to trade union newspaper statistics, more than nine million families have an annual income of less than 2,000 US dollars, which is one-half to one-third of the officially stipulated minimum living expense. More than five million retail business staff earn 24 to 25 US dollars per week.

　　According to materials from the American trade union newspaper, workers working in laundries, hotels, restaurants, and other institutions live in extreme poverty. The wages of agricultural workers are particularly low. According to materials from the Agricultural Workers Union, the weekly income of the 750,000 workers working on farms in the South and Southwest is 8 to 17 US dollars, and only a few workers' wages exceed 20 US dollars. There are also 1.5 million farm households in the United States with an annual income of less than 1,000 US dollars.

　　美经济学家谈美元贬值
　　一块美元只合战前五毛
　　许多工人工资不够过最低生活
    据新华社27日讯  纽约消息：美国经济学家和国际货币专家弗兰兹·皮克最近在一份关于美元贬值的专门研究材料分析了战后美国的通货膨胀给美元带来的危害。皮克指出：如果以1939—1941年的美元购买力为一百，那么美元目前的国内购买力已经比战前减少了50％以上。如果以1946年1月作基数，1956年12月的美元国内购买力也减少了29％。皮克根据美元贬值这种程度得出下列五个结论：
    一、美国银行1956年的存款按票面价值计算比1946年多33％，但是按照1946年的购买力计算，只高出1.1％。
    二、从1946年到1956年，按照纸币美元计算，每人的银行存款增加了16％；而按照1946年的购买力单位计算，这种存款却下降了将近16％（这时期中，美国人口从1946年的一亿四千一百二十万增加到1956年的一亿六千九百四十万）。
    三、纸币发行的绝对数字增加了6％，从1946年的二百九十亿美元增加到1956年11月的三百零八亿美元。但是按照购买力来计算，通货的价值在同期里减少了24％以上。就每个人来说，按票面计算的通货流通量减少了11％以上，而按1946年的价值来算，每人的通货流通量减少了不下35％。
    四、按每个人来说，国民生产总值按1946年的购买力计算只提高了16％，而按货币票面价值来说却提高了63％。
    五、黄金表现了一种“似非而是”的跌价。用美元购买力来计算，金价从1946年起从三十五美元一盎司降为目前的二四·八五美元。因此，在1946年，美国黄金的储存按“票面价值”等于二百零七亿美元，而在1956年11月为二百二十亿美元。这是增加了6％。但是按1946年美元的购买力来算，这些黄金实际只值一百五十六亿美元。
    皮克认为，要应付美元贬值有两种办法，第一种办法是继续以每年使购买力减少3％到4％的速度贬值，以便使美国目前的所谓“纸币景气”能够继续维持一两年。但是他指出，这段时期一过，美元贬值的能力就会加速破坏资产，恶性通货膨胀就会开始发生作用，货币贬值也就成为不可避免了。第二种办法是紧缩通货，使货币价值不变，大体处在现在的购买力水平上。但是他指出，采取这样的办法将会造成“一段时期的失业”。
    新华社27日讯  据塔斯社纽约26日讯：美国工会报纸“劳工日报”发表了“格林”贸易公司的女工作人员玛丽·德雷克的谈话。她在回答对美国的经济繁荣作何看法的问题时说：“这个跟我们没有关系。”她每周收入二十四美元，而官方规定的最低生活费是每周八十六美元。在美国，有相当大一部分工人处在同玛丽·德雷克同样的情况中。据工会报纸统计，有九百万以上的家庭全年收入不到二千美元，也即是官方规定最低生活费的二分之一至三分之一。五百万以上零售商业工作人员每周的收入是二十四美元到二十五美元。
    根据美国工会报纸的材料，在洗衣房、旅馆、饭店等机构工作的工人生活极为贫困。农业工人的工资特别低微。根据农业工人工会的材料，在南部和西南部农场工作的七十五万工人每周收入是八美元至十七美元，仅有少数工人的工资超过二十美元。美国还有一百五十万全年收入不到一千美元的农户。
