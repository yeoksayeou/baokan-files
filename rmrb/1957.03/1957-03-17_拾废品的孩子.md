    The Child Who Collects Scraps
    Zhang Jiping
    One Sunday, after dinner, I went for a stroll on the street alone.
    When I reached the corner of Xuegong Street, I became extra careful. Because half a year ago, also on a Sunday evening, I passed by here and slipped on a banana peel, knocking out a front tooth. I had a "gold tooth" installed that was very conspicuous to others, which made me very unhappy. From the unpleasant "gold tooth" I thought of the banana peel, and from the banana peel I became angry at the place where I fell. Therefore, whenever I pass by here, I am always particularly careful.
    Not far from here, there is a large fruit store. I bought four oranges and walked away from the fruit store, peeling and eating one as I strolled. Because I had learned a lesson from my own fall, I didn't want to throw the fruit peel on the ground. Just as I was about to throw the orange peel into the trash can, I suddenly heard someone call out:
    "Don't throw it away, give it to me!"
    It was a child about ten years old, his clothes were not very clean, but he was dressed neatly, and his face was red. He held out a hand to me; it seemed he had been following me from the entrance of the fruit store.
    I withdrew my hand that was reaching for the trash can and gave him the orange peel. I picked up another orange and continued walking forward, peeling as I went.
    I walked very slowly and ate very slowly, not paying attention to what the child was doing. After a while, I heard the voice behind me again:
    "Eat faster! You're eating so slowly!" His voice was extremely impatient. I turned around and saw it was the same child, waiting for my second orange peel.
    Clearly, I was touched by these childish words and quickly peeled the peel for him. The child said, "Thank you!" and turned to leave. I asked, "Little brother, can you tell me what you do with the orange peels?"
    "Sell them for money! They are medicinal materials."
    "How much can you sell them for?"
    "Three cents a catty, but if they are freshly peeled like yours and not dirty at all, they can be sold for four cents a catty; if they are too dirty, no one will take them."
    Only then did I notice the long string of orange peels he was holding in his hand, weighing several catties. I asked, "You've had a good harvest today, you can exchange them for some lollipops."
    "Exchange for candy? We never exchange for candy, we have to send them to the waste recycling station. It's what our team leader ordered."
    "Team leader?"
    "Yes, team leader."
    Afraid that I wouldn't understand, he explained, "The team leader is Li Guoxiang from the fourth grade. My task is to collect orange peels, my name is Liu Tongxing."
    "So it's organized!" I thought to myself, "What do they do with the money they sell?" At this moment, another person peeling an orange walked by. Seeing this, the child was unwilling to say more to me, only telling me that he was a student at Chenggongqiao Elementary School.
    The director of teaching affairs at Chenggongqiao Elementary School was a classmate of mine in the past. To satisfy my curiosity, I went to visit him the next afternoon.
    The director of teaching affairs told me that Li Guoxiang was their best student, the captain of the Young Pioneers, and Liu Tongxing's nickname was "Little Mongoose," a bit mischievous, and didn't follow the rules much before. He joined the team in the second half of last year and has improved, but he is still a bit "fierce."
    I talked to him about the orange peel matter, wanting to find out the whole story, and he told me what had happened.
    Recently, since the newspapers have been publicizing the increase in production and savings, the school has been educating elementary school students in this regard. The Young Pioneers have automatically organized students to collect waste products and sell them to the state. They are very well organized, with divisions of labor and full-time positions. This activity has been going on for almost a month. The teachers, fearing that they would delay their studies or that deviations of one kind or another might occur, stipulated that they could only be active on Sundays. In the first half of the month, they sold more than ten yuan, opened a current deposit account at the Chenggongqiao Bank Savings Office, and, according to everyone's decision, used the money to buy books and place them in the school's library, and also took out a portion of the money to buy kraft paper to repair old books.
    My classmate took me to visit their "waste product warehouse." The door was locked, but looking in from the window, a small room was piled with several piles. This pile was broken glass, that pile was rags, and there were also broken iron, used toothpaste tubes, miscellaneous rubber... and so on. Only there were no orange peels, it is said that orange peels rot easily in the warehouse, perhaps they are stored separately.
    Next, my classmate led me to visit the team leader. She was a girl about twelve years old, and her father was a peddler who specialized in collecting waste products. When we went, Li Guoxiang was washing dishes, and her father was also at home. A large vegetable basket was hanging from the eaves, filled with orange peels.
    We drank tea at Li's house. Li Guoxiang's father liked his daughter very much. He only had one thing he was not satisfied with his daughter: she never sold the waste she picked up to her father. Li Guoxiang's father jokingly said, "She is afraid that I will 'exploit' her, and insists on selling it directly to the waste recycling station. Well, let her go, but sometimes they still have to ask me, this 'consultant'!"

    拾废品的孩子
    张季平
    星期天，我吃完晚饭，一个人到街上去蹓跶。
    走到学宫街拐角的地方，我就格外小心。因为在半年前，也是一个星期天的傍晚，我从这里经过，被地上的香蕉皮滑了一跤，摔掉一颗门牙，镶了一颗在别人面前非常触目的“金牙齿”，使我十分不快。由不愉快的“金牙齿”想起香蕉皮，由香蕉皮迁怒到那个跌过跤的地方，所以，以后凡从这里经过，我总特别留神。
    离这里不远的地方，有一个很大的水果店。我买了四个橘子，离开水果店漫步向前走去，随手拿着一个边剥边吃。因为自己摔跤有了教训，水果皮不愿随地丢了。我正要把橘子皮抛进垃圾箱的时候，突然听到有人叫：
    “不要丢，给我！”
    是一个年约十岁的小孩，衣服不大清洁，但穿得还整齐，脸儿红通通的。他向我伸出了一只手，大约他从水果店门口起，就跟在我的后面了。
    我将伸向垃圾箱的手收回来，把橘子皮送给了他。随手又拿起一只橘子，又是边剥边向前走。
    我走得很慢，也吃得很慢，没有注意那个孩子怎样了。一会儿，我又听到后面的声音：
    “快些吃?，吃得这么慢！”他的声音是极不耐烦的，我转过身，看到又是那个孩子，他在等我的第二块橘子皮。
    显然，我为这种稚气的言辞打动了，迅速地剥出皮来给他。孩子说了一声“谢谢！”转身待走，我问：“小弟弟，你能告诉我你要橘子皮干什么吗？”
    “卖钱嘛！它是药材哩。”
    “能卖多少钱呢？”
    “三分钱一斤，但像你那样刚剥下来没有弄脏一点的，可以卖四分钱一斤；如果太脏了就根本不收。”
    这时我才发现他手里提的一长串橘子皮，总有好几斤重。我问： “你今天收获不少，可以换几个棒棒糖了。”
    “换糖？我们从来不换糖，我们要送到废品收购站去。是我们队长规定的。”
    “队长？”
    “是呵，是队长。”
    他怕我不懂，接着解释：“队长就是四年级的李国祥。我的任务是专门收橘子皮，我叫刘同兴。” 
    “原来是有组织的！”我心里想：“卖了钱干什么用呢？”这时，又有一个剥橘子皮的走过，看样子，那孩子不愿和我多说了，只告诉了我一句，他是陈公桥小学的学生。
    陈公桥小学的教导主任是我过去的同学，为了满足好奇心，我在第二天下午去拜访他。
    这位教导主任告诉我：李国祥是他们最好的学生，少先队的大队长，刘同兴的外号叫“小猛子”，有点调皮，以前不大守规矩，去年下半年入了队，变好些了，但还是有些“猛”。
    我和他谈起橘子皮的事，想探知一下原委，他告诉了我这件事的经过。
    近来，报纸上宣传增产节约以来，学校向小学生进行了这方面的教育，少先队自动地把同学组织起来收集废品，卖给国家。他们组织得很好，有分工，有专职，这种活动进行了将近一个月了，老师怕他们耽误功课或发生这样那样的偏差，规定他们只能在星期天活动。上半个月他们卖了十多元，在陈公桥银行储蓄所开了一个活期存款的户头，并且根据大家的决议，这笔钱买图书放在学校的图书室，还抽出一部分钱买牛皮纸作修补旧图书之用。
    我的同学带我去参观了他们的“废品仓库”，门是锁着的，从窗口望去，一间不大的房子里堆了好几堆，这一堆是破玻璃，那一堆是破布，还有破铁，用完了的牙膏袋子，零碎的橡胶……等等。只是没有橘子皮，据说，橘子皮在仓库里容易腐烂，也许是另外保藏着。
    接着，我的同学带领我拜访了那位队长。她是一个女孩子，年约十二岁，她的父亲是一个专收废品的小贩。我们去的时候，李国祥正在洗碗，她爸爸也在家里，屋檐前悬挂着一只大菜筐，里面都是橘子皮。
    我们在李家喝了茶。李国祥的父亲非常喜欢他的这个女儿。他只有一点不满意他的女儿：拾来的废品从来不卖给爸爸。李国祥的父亲半开玩笑地说：“她怕我‘剥削’，硬要直接卖到废品收购站去。也好，就让她去吧，但她们有时候还是不得不请教我这位‘顾问’哩！”
