Comrade Premier, Esteemed Comrades of the Delegation, Comrades, Friends:

The Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic, headed by Premier Široký, has arrived in our capital yesterday at the invitation of the Government of the People's Republic of China. Today, we gather here with great pleasure and heartfelt warmth to celebrate with them. Please allow me, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, to extend our sincere and warm welcome to our distinguished guests, esteemed Comrade Široký, and all comrades of the delegation.

The people of China and Czechoslovakia have always enjoyed a deep, fraternal friendship. The Chinese people are very pleased to see that under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak people have achieved great successes in all aspects after twelve years of socialist construction. These achievements have laid a solid foundation for the further development of the national economy and the continuous improvement of the material and cultural standards of the people of Czechoslovakia. Now, the Czechoslovak people are striving to fulfill their second Five-Year Plan. We sincerely wish the Czechoslovak people new and greater achievements in the implementation of their second Five-Year Plan.

As a member of the socialist family, Czechoslovakia has always been faithful to the principles of proletarian internationalism and has strived to continuously consolidate the unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. The Chinese people, like the Czechoslovak people, firmly believe that the unity of socialist countries is the most reliable guarantee for maintaining peace and the cause of human progress. And we are determined to make our utmost efforts to continuously strengthen the unity between our socialist countries.

Internationally, Czechoslovakia, together with all peace-loving countries and people, has consistently fought to ease international tensions and maintain world peace. Czechoslovakia has made unremitting efforts to establish a European collective security system and prevent the resurgence of West German militarism. It has consistently sympathized with and supported the anti-colonial movements of the people of Asia and Africa. After the Korean armistice, the Czechoslovak government sent its delegation to participate in the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea, making significant efforts to supervise the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The Chinese people admire and fully support Czechoslovakia's efforts to maintain world peace. Although the imperialist aggressive forces are still attempting to intensify the Cold War and carry out aggression and expansion, past events have repeatedly proven that as long as we rely on the strength of all peace-loving countries and people in the world and fight resolutely, any conspiracy of international reactionary forces can be defeated, and the wheel of history is bound to move forward.

The fraternal and cooperative relations between China and Czechoslovakia have greatly developed in the past few years. The leaders of our two countries have paid many friendly visits to each other. Vice Chairman Zhu De and the Chinese People's Congress delegation headed by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen received warm hospitality from the Czechoslovak government and a grand welcome from the people during their visit to Czechoslovakia, which we will never forget. Trade between our two countries is developing. The Czechoslovak Republic has provided us with great assistance in supplying large machinery and precision instruments and equipment, and in sending experts to impart advanced scientific and technological experience. Not long ago, our country manufactured a 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine. The trial production of this equipment was carried out under the direct guidance of Czechoslovak experts. In the cultural field, the cooperative relations between our two countries are also constantly developing. In many aspects, we have learned valuable things from our Czechoslovak comrades. Here, please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, to express our sincere gratitude to the Czechoslovak government and people for their sincere assistance.

Comrade Premier, the visit of the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic to our country this time is a major event in the friendly relations between China and Czechoslovakia. It will undoubtedly further strengthen the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries, promote the development of our two countries' socialist construction, and strengthen the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, thereby benefiting the noble cause of world peace and human progress.

Dear comrades and friends, please allow me to raise my glass to the increasing prosperity of the Czechoslovak Republic, to the unbreakable fraternal friendship between China and Czechoslovakia, to the great unity of the socialist countries, to world peace, and to the health of Comrade President Zápotocký of the Czechoslovak Republic.

    在欢迎捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团的宴会上
    周恩来总理的讲话敬爱的总理同志，敬爱的代表团全体同志们，同志们，朋友们：
    以西罗基总理为首的捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团，应中华人民共和国政府的邀请，已经在昨天来到了我们的首都。今天，我们怀着十分愉快而亲切的心情同他们欢聚一堂。请允许我代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民向我们的贵宾，敬爱的西罗基同志和代表团全体同志们，表示衷心的热烈的欢迎。
    中捷两国人民一向有着深厚的、兄弟般的友谊。中国人民十分高兴地看到，捷克斯洛伐克人民在光荣的捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下经过十二年的社会主义建设，在各个方面都取得了巨大的成就。这些成就为捷克斯洛伐克共和国进一步发展国民经济和不断提高人民的物质和文化水平奠定了可靠的基础。现在，捷克斯洛伐克人民正在为实现第二个五年计划而奋斗。我们衷心地预祝捷克斯洛伐克人民在执行第二个五年计划的过程中获得新的更大的成就。
    作为社会主义大家庭的一员，捷克斯洛伐克一贯忠实于无产阶级国际主义的原则，并且为不断巩固以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结而努力。中国人民和捷克斯洛伐克人民一样，深信社会主义各国的团结是维护和平和人类进步事业最可靠的保证。并且决心为不断加强我们社会主义国家之间的团结尽最大的努力。
    在国际上，捷克斯洛伐克同所有爱好和平的国家和人民一起，一贯为和缓国际紧张局势、维护世界和平而斗争。捷克斯洛伐克为建立欧洲集体安全体系和防止西德军国主义的再起作了不懈的努力。它一贯同情和支持亚非各国人民的反殖民主义运动。在朝鲜停战以后，捷克斯洛伐克政府派遣自己的代表团参加了朝鲜中立国监察委员会的工作，对监督朝鲜停战协定的执行作了重大的努力。中国人民十分钦佩并且完全支持捷克斯洛伐克这些维护世界和平的努力。虽然帝国主义侵略势力还在企图加紧冷战进行侵略扩张，但是过去的事实一再证明，只要我们依靠全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的力量，坚决斗争，国际反动势力的任何阴谋活动都是可以击败的，历史的车轮是一定要前进的。
    中捷两国兄弟般的友好合作关系，在过去几年中已经有了很大的发展。我们两国的领导人曾互相进行了多次的友好访问。朱德副主席和以彭真副委员长为首的中国人大代表团在访问捷克斯洛伐克期间受到捷克斯洛伐克政府的热情招待和人民的盛大欢迎，是我们永远不能忘记的。我们两国的贸易正在发展。捷克斯洛伐克共和国在供应大型机器和精密仪器等设备方面，在派遣专家传授先进的科学技术经验方面，给了我们很大的帮助。不久以前，我国制成了六千瓩的蒸汽涡轮机，这个设备的试制工作，就是在捷克斯洛伐克专家的直接指导下进行的。在文化方面，我们两国的合作关系也在不断地发展。我们在许多方面，向捷克斯洛伐克同志学到了宝贵的东西。在这里，请允许我代表中国政府和人民对捷克斯洛伐克政府和人民给予我们的真诚援助表示衷心的感谢。
    总理同志，这次捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团来我国访问，是我们中捷两国友好关系中的一件大事，它无疑地将会进一步加强我们两国的友好合作关系，促进我们两国社会主义建设事业的发展，加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结，从而有利于世界和平和人类进步的崇高事业。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们，请允许我举杯为捷克斯洛伐克共和国的日益繁荣，为中捷两国牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊，为社会主义各国的伟大团结，为世界和平，为捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统萨波托斯基同志的健康干杯。　（新华社）
