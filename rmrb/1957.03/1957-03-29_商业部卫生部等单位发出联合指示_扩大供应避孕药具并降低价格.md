Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: Local areas will expand the supply of contraceptive drugs and devices. The prices of these drugs and devices will also be comprehensively reduced from April 1st.

This was announced in a joint instruction recently issued by the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Health, and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives.

The instruction requires medical companies at all levels, grass-roots supply and marketing cooperatives, hospitals, maternity and child health hospitals (institutes, stations), joint clinics, etc., to supply contraceptive drugs and devices in a timely and sufficient manner; and points out that this is an important task for medical companies, supply and marketing cooperatives, and relevant health and medical departments at all levels.

The instruction said that although local health administrative departments have taken some measures in guiding contraception, and local pharmaceutical companies have also organized the supply of some contraceptive drugs and devices, the supply areas are not yet many, especially in rural areas where the supply is very limited; some supply units do not supply in a timely manner, and it is inconvenient for the masses to purchase. Therefore, the instruction stipulates that pharmaceutical companies at all levels, including joint state-private pharmacies, must actively organize supply and sources of supply; department stores, local trading companies, medicinal material companies (including traditional Chinese medicine stores) and grass-roots supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels, except in minority areas, should also handle contraceptive products; general hospitals, obstetrics and gynecology hospitals, maternity and child health hospitals, health centers, health stations, joint clinics and other health care units should not only actively conduct contraceptive technical guidance and publicity, but also should sell or sell contraceptive devices on consignment.

In order to facilitate purchases by the masses, the instruction also stipulates that in areas and units with suitable conditions, special counters can be set up for sales. Salespersons should be trained as much as possible in contraceptive knowledge, the use and storage of contraceptive devices and drugs, and hygiene knowledge, so as to explain to purchasers when selling. Generally, female salespersons should serve female customers, and male salespersons should serve male customers.

In order to reduce the burden on the masses, the instruction decided to reduce the retail price of domestically produced condoms from the original 12 fen each to 5 fen, and the domestic cervical cap from 1.5 yuan each to 1 yuan. The prices of other varieties will also be reduced accordingly, and a national uniform price will be implemented.

　　商业部卫生部等单位发出联合指示
　　扩大供应避孕药具并降低价格
    新华社28日讯  各地将扩大供应避孕药品和避孕用具。这些药品和用具的价格，从4月1日起也将全面降低。
    这是商业部、卫生部、中华全国供销合作总社在最近发出的联合指示中宣布的。
    指示要求各级医药公司、基层供销合作社、医院、妇幼保健院（所、站）、联合诊所等，及时地、充分地供应避孕药品和避孕用具；并且指出这是各级医药公司、供销合作社和有关卫生医疗部门的一项重要任务。
    指示说，各地卫生行政部门在指导避孕方面虽然已经采取了一些措施，各地医药公司也组织供应了一些避孕药品和用具，但是，供应的地区还不多，特别是农村很少供应；有些供应单位供应不及时，群众购买不方便。因此指示规定，各级医药公司，包括公私合营药房在内，必须积极组织货源和供应；各级百货公司、地方贸易公司、药材公司（包括中药店）及基层供销合作社，除了少数民族地区以外，都应该兼营避孕用品；卫生医疗单位的综合性医院、妇产科医院、妇幼保健院、保健所、保健站、联合诊所等除了要积极进行避孕技术指导及宣传以外，也应该经销或代销避孕用具。
    为了便利群众购买，指示还规定在有条件的地区和单位，可以设立专柜销售。营业员应当尽可能地进行避孕常识、避孕用具和药品的使用、保管、卫生知识的训练，以便在销售的时候向购用者说明。一般还应以女营业员供应女顾客，男营业员供应男顾客。
    为了减轻群众负担，指示决定把国产阴茎套的零售价由原来的每个一角二分降低为五分，国产子宫帽由每个一元五角降低为一元，其他品种的价格也相应降低，并且实行全国统一价格。
