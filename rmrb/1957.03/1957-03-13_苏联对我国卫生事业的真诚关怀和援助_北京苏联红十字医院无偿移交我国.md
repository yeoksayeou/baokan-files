Li Dequan said at the meeting: The Soviet government's gratuitous transfer of all the equipment and assets of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital to our government today is a concrete manifestation of the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. It vividly illustrates the sincere and selfless concern and assistance of our great Soviet friends for China's health undertakings.

Wu Yuzhang, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, also spoke at the meeting. He said that we must continue to learn from the advanced Soviet medical experience and run this hospital well.

Vice Mayor of Beijing, Wang Kunlun, thanked the Soviet experts on behalf of the people of Beijing.

The Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital was established in China in June 1952 by the Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union. This modern comprehensive hospital now has seventeen departments, 320 beds, and can receive 800 outpatients every day. Over the past five years, 126 Soviet medical experts have worked here. They have trained many Chinese medical personnel with modern medical standards, who are now able to undertake the hospital's treatment, scientific research, and teaching tasks. Under these circumstances, the Soviet government proposed to donate the hospital to the Chinese government free of charge. (Attached picture)
