Fuxin Uses New Mongolian Script to Eliminate Illiteracy

    (Our newspaper reports) Fuxin County, Liaoning Province, is an area where the Mongolian people are relatively concentrated, with a Mongolian population of over 86,000 in the county.

    Starting in March of last year, the County People's Committee began training 240 New Mongolian script teachers and 137 people's school teachers. They all learned the New Mongolian script literacy method and teaching methods, laying the foundation for promoting the New Mongolian script. Since December of last year, the county has been using the New Mongolian script to eliminate illiteracy, with over 7,000 people participating in literacy classes, exceeding the original plan by about 40%.

    Using the New Mongolian script to eliminate illiteracy is very popular among the masses. The Dongfanghong Agricultural Production Cooperative's Miliyingzi production team in Hada Houshao Township, Jiu Temple District, established a New Mongolian script learning group in November last year. No fewer than thirty people participate in learning every day. They learned the New Mongolian script alphabet in just one month and are now learning phonetics and shorthand, planning to complete the New Mongolian script learning by April this year.

    阜新用新蒙文扫除文盲
    本报讯  辽宁省阜新县是蒙族人民比较集中的地区，全县蒙族人民有八万六千多人。 
    从去年3月份起，县人民委员会开始训练了二百四十名新蒙文教师和一百三十七名民校教师，他们都学会了新蒙文识字法和教学法，为推行新蒙文打下基础。从去年12月份起，该县已采用新蒙文扫除文盲，参加识字学习的人数达七千多人，超过原计划的40％左右。
    用新蒙文扫除文盲，很受群众欢迎。旧庙区哈达户稍乡东方红农业生产合作社迷力营子生产队，去年11月就成立了新蒙文学习小组，每天参加学习的不下三十人。他们只用一个月的工夫就学完了新蒙文的字母，现在正在学习拼音和速写，计划在今年4月将新蒙文学完。
