Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 1st. Xinhua News Agency reporter Tian Liangeng reported: In Yunnan's border region, seven hundred thousand ethnic minorities with unclear class differentiation are directly transitioning to socialism with the vigorous support of the Party and the state.

These ethnic minority areas, which are in a clan society or retain remnants of clan society due to historical reasons, experimentally established 200 agricultural cooperatives before this spring. The vast majority of these agricultural cooperatives increased production by about 30%, and some cooperatives more than doubled production. The production and living standards of the members have significantly developed and improved. Now, various localities are planning and focusing on building new agricultural cooperatives and vigorously developing various types of mutual aid teams. It is expected that by early March this year, the percentage of farm households in the Jingpo ethnic area of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture participating in agricultural cooperatives will account for 13% of the total farm households. In Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture and other places, a number of agricultural cooperatives will also be established on a trial basis.

The Jingpo, Lisu, Kawa, Lahu and other ethnic groups, who live in compact communities along the thousands of miles of border in Yunnan, have very low productivity due to historical reasons. Some are in the clan society stage, and some have begun to have class differentiation, but the absolute number of means of production occupied by each class is very small, and they retain some remnants of clan society. Therefore, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the instructions of the central government and the investigation of the socio-economic conditions of these ethnic groups, believes that they can skip the democratic reform movement stage. Under certain conditions, they can firmly rely on poor peasants, unite all working people, unite and transform all ethnic public leaders who have connections with the masses. With the strong support and help of the state, they can gradually improve people's living standards and political awareness through mutual assistance and cooperation, develop production and all aspects of work related to production, gradually overcome backward factors that are not conducive to ethnic development, and gradually transition to socialism.

In recent years, the Party committees of various ethnic regions in Yunnan's border areas have led the relevant departments to earnestly unite and educate ethnic upper-class figures through launching patriotic production movements in these mountainous areas. A number of advanced elements have also emerged from among them; the masses' awareness has also been raised, and 2.3% of the population have emerged as mass activists, and more than 1,000 ethnic cadres have been trained. Some factors that are not conducive to ethnic development are also gradually changing. The vast number of farmers in mountainous areas demand to be organized to develop production and get rid of the poverty and backwardness formed by history, which has created favorable conditions for carrying out mutual aid and cooperation work.

In view of the current backwardness of ethnic minorities in mountainous areas, the Party committees in various border areas have adopted a very cautious attitude in the process of experimenting with mutual aid groups and cooperatives, exploring cooperative forms, scales and speeds that are suitable for ethnic culture and awareness. In the Jingpo and Lisu areas, the scale of the cooperative is generally about 20 households, and some are about 10 households, in order to adapt to the existing management level of the ethnic groups. A large number of mutual aid groups developed in the directly transitioning areas of Nujiang, Xishuangbanna and other autonomous prefectures are organized based on the original customs of the ethnic groups and improved with socialist principles. Dehong, Nujiang and other autonomous prefectures have also summarized some methods in the management of agricultural cooperatives, which not only gradually improve the ethnic minorities from the original primitive egalitarianism, but also adapt to the current acceptance ability of the ethnic groups. Although the agricultural cooperatives established on a trial basis have encountered some difficulties due to lack of experience, after various efforts, the vast majority of cooperatives achieved increased production in last year's autumn harvest, and the management level has also improved, and many unprecedented new atmospheres have emerged. In the Mansa Agricultural Cooperative of the Jingpo ethnic group in the Dayingjiang River Basin, every member has learned to record work points in Jingpo language. Members of the Wonu Agricultural Cooperative of the Kawa ethnic group in the Ximeng mountainous area have learned new technologies such as growing vegetables and rice from slash-and-burn cultivation. The families of many members have gone from lacking food for several months to having enough grain. Many "mountain officials" who did not participate in labor before are now actively participating in production.

The strong support of the state is an extremely important condition for these areas to directly transition to socialism through mutual aid and cooperation. Last spring, the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture successively established 17 mountainous production and cultural stations in the Jingpo ethnic area. The cultural station includes mass work, schools, health, trade, grain and other institutions, which is convenient to concentrate the strength of all aspects to support Jingpo farmers to develop production and focus on the trial establishment of agricultural cooperatives. After completing the peaceful consultation on land reform, Xishuangbanna, Honghe and other autonomous prefectures (regions) have also gradually strengthened their leadership over directly transitioning areas. Party committees in various border areas have set up special agencies or assigned special personnel to be responsible for the leadership of such areas. The state has vigorously provided and lent plows, farm tools, seeds and food grains to the newly established agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid groups free of charge according to different situations to support their production.

### 云南边疆阶级分化还不明显的少数民族  正在直接向社会主义过渡

    云南边疆阶级分化还不明显的少数民族
    正在直接向社会主义过渡
    新华社昆明1日电  新华社记者田良耕报道：云南边疆七十万阶级分化还不明显的少数民族在党和国家的大力扶持下，正直接向社会主义过渡。
    这些因历史原因而处在氏族社会或保留着若干氏族社会残余的少数民族地区，在今春以前试办了二百个农业社，这些农业社中的绝大多数增产三成左右，有的社增产一倍多，社员的生产和生活有了显著发展和提高。现在，各地正有计划有重点地新建一批农业社和大力发展各种类型的互助组。预计到今年3月上旬，德宏傣族景颇族自治州的景颇族地区参加农业社的农户，将占总农户的13％，西双版纳傣族自治州、怒江傈僳族自治州等地也将再重点试办一批农业社。
    聚居在云南边疆数千里国境线上的景颇族、傈僳族、佧佤族、拉祜族等民族，由于历史原因，生产力都很低。有的处于氏族社会阶段，有的虽已开始有了阶级分化，但各阶层占有生产资料的绝对数字很小，并保留着若干氏族社会残余。因此，中共云南省委依据中央的指示和对这些民族的社会经济状况进行调查，认为可以不再经过民主改革运动阶段，在一定条件下，采取坚决依靠贫苦农民，团结一切劳动人民，团结与改造一切与群众有联系的民族公众领袖，在国家大力扶持和帮助下，通过互助合作，发展生产以及与生产有关的各方面工作，逐步提高人民的生活水平和政治觉悟，逐渐克服不利于民族发展的落后因素，逐步过渡到社会主义。
    几年来，云南边疆各民族地区党委领导各有关部门，通过在这些山区展开爱国生产运动，认真团结教育了民族上层人士，其中还出现一批先进分子；群众觉悟也有提高，涌现出占人口2.3％的群众积极分子和培养出一千多名民族干部，某些不利于民族发展的因素，也正在逐渐改变中，广大山区农民要求组织起来发展生产，摆脱历史形成的贫困落后状况，这就为开展互助合作工作创造了有利条件。
    鉴于山区少数民族当前的落后状况，边疆各地党委在试办互助组、合作社过程中，采取了十分慎重的态度，摸索适合民族文化与觉悟水平的合作化形式、规模和速度。在景颇族地区、傈僳族地区，社的规模一般为二十户左右，有的是十户左右。以适应民族现有的经营管理水平。怒江、西双版纳等自治州直接过渡地区发展的大批互助组，是根据民族原有的习惯加以提高，赋予社会主义原则而组织起来的。德宏、怒江等自治州还在农业社经营管理方法上，总结出一些既使少数民族从原有的原始平均主义思想基础上逐步得到提高，又适应当前民族的接受能力的办法。试办的农业社虽然遇到一些出于缺乏经验而来的困难，但经过各方面的工作后，去年秋收分配绝大多数社都获得增产，管理水平也有提高，出现了许多从古未有的新气象。大盈江流域的景颇族曼撒农业社，社员已个个学会用景颇文记工分，西盟山区佧佤族窝努农业社社员由原来的刀耕火种学会种菜、种水稻等新技术。许多社员的家庭已由缺数月的口粮达到粮食够吃。原来不参加劳动的“山官”，不少也积极参加了生产。
    国家的大力扶助是这类地区通过互助合作直接过渡到社会主义的极为重要的条件。去年春天，德宏傣族景颇族自治州先后在景颇族地区建立了十七个山区生产文化站。文化站包括群众工作、学校、卫生、贸易、粮食等机构，便于集中各方面的力量，来支持景颇族农民发展生产和重点试办农业社。西双版纳、红河等自治州（区）在完成和平协商土地改革以后，也逐步加强对直接过渡地区的领导。边疆各地党委设立专门机构或指派专人，负责这类地区的领导。国家对新建的农业社和互助组，分别不同情况都大力无偿发放和贷放耕牛、农具、籽种和口粮，扶持他们生产。
