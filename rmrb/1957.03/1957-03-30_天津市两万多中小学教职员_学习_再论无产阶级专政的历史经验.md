　　Tianjin City's Over 20,000 Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff
　　Study "Once More on the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship"
　　(Our newspaper dispatch) Under the leadership of the Education Work Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, over 23,000 primary and secondary school teachers and staff in Tianjin have begun studying the article "Once More on the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship." This study is scheduled to take up six hours of theoretical study time per week for the teachers and staff, with a study period of three months.
　　The purpose of this study is to enable primary and secondary school teachers and staff to better understand the basic content of the article "Once More on the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship"; and through the study of the document, to recognize the characteristics of the current domestic and international situation and its developments, and to further receive socialist ideological education. This study requires focusing on resolving the following three issues: First, to further distinguish between the boundaries of contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and contradictions among the people, as well as the different methods adopted to resolve these two types of contradictions with different natures, thereby strengthening the cultivation of the proletarian standpoint. Second, to correctly understand the basic experience of the Russian October Revolution and Soviet socialist construction and its great significance, to further understand the superiority of the socialist system and the necessity of the dictatorship of the proletariat, as well as the leading role of the Party in the cause of socialism, to correctly treat the shortcomings and errors in socialist revolution and socialist construction, and to correctly treat the issues of democracy and freedom; and it is required that, on these issues, the boundaries between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism should be gradually distinguished. Third, to learn to use the ideological methods of dialectical materialism to observe and analyze problems.
　　In terms of learning methods, it is required to implement the spirit of integrating theory with practice, to advocate a rational attitude and free discussion, and to oppose dogmatic learning methods. At the same time, Party organizations in various schools are also required to conscientiously implement the principle of voluntary participation in learning by the masses.
　　In order to help primary and secondary school teachers and staff understand the basic content of the article "Once More on the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship," Liang Hanbing, the Minister of the Education Work Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, gave a guidance report on the study to some teachers and staff of various primary and secondary schools on the afternoon of the 23rd.
