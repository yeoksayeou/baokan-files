Comrade Huang Yanpei's Speech

Under the call of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," my suggestion is: only by improving the correctness of the plan and having everyone increase production and practice economy starting from themselves can we overcome the current phenomenon of demand exceeding supply.

I accepted Chairman Mao's call for "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," listened to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the Second Five-Year Plan, and, combined with my usual thoughts, contribute some opinions.

New China is vigorously carrying out socialist construction, and in the midst of all the high-speed continuous development, a major contradictory phenomenon that is almost universally present is the excess of demand over supply.

People's living standards have improved, purchasing power has increased, and the need for food, clothing, commodities, and various other items has increased.

Workers' enthusiasm for work has generally increased, production targets have been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded, and the need for raw materials, machines, and all tools has increased.

The rural areas after collectivization have increased their need for fertilizers—chemical fertilizers, agricultural tools—new agricultural tools, and various other items.

The people's ability to attend school has improved, and the need for schools, teachers, educational supplies, and various other items has increased.

The people's ability to seek medical treatment has improved, and the need for hospitals, doctors, all medical personnel, medicines, and various other items has increased.

The efficiency of transportation has increased, and the need for railways, highways, vehicles, ships, and various other items has increased.

More and more new buildings are being constructed, and the need for workers, materials, tools, and everything else has increased.

The situation is endless. Although production has increased, and increased a lot, the supply is still insufficient, tense, but stable.

Everyone knows that all this is not bad but good, it is an inevitable process, an unavoidable phenomenon, but what method should be used to change this situation? Chairman Mao often instructed us: The basics are very good, there are many difficulties, but they can be overcome. We are determined to overcome it.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun raised many questions in his report, seeking answers. Based on my experience since liberation and before liberation, I offer some opinions separately for responsible comrades to refer to. The reason for only providing reference is that I do not have comprehensive information and cannot offer opinions based on comprehensive observation and analysis. But even if it is based on one-sided information, if the situation is real, I am willing to contribute as much as possible in accordance with my usual habit of knowing everything and saying everything frankly.

First, I would like to explain a few terms, which I myself think are easy to make mistakes about:

⒈ Experience and Empiricism Empiricism is undesirable. Because society is evolving and developing, past methods are not necessarily applicable now; one region has its own specific circumstances, and the experience of region A is not necessarily fully applicable to region B. If we do not consider the current and local situation, and stick to the past and the methods commonly used in a certain place, and never change, this is empiricism, which is wrong. But experience is not necessarily without value, it depends on whether the current and local situation is still applicable, if it is still applicable, and very applicable, or still applicable after partial modification, then this experience is valuable experience. Empiricism must be opposed, but it is also wrong to obliterate all experience by opposing empiricism.

⒉ Position and Localism Staff often consider and think more about the issues of their own position when considering problems, which is inevitable. The more enthusiastic they are about their duties, the more they may consider the work of their own position. This cannot be said to be bad either. The problem is that it is not acceptable to only strive for the interests of one's own position, regardless of the overall interests, or even regardless of the provisions of policies and orders. Furthermore, only knowing one's own position and not taking care of others' positions, causing conflicts of interest, friction, and lack of cooperation, this more or less localism, which is a remnant of the bad practices of bourgeois society, must be completely overcome.

⒊ One-sided and Comprehensive View Any matter is not isolated. It is absolutely impossible to look at things without comprehensive observation and analysis, and to stick to a certain point to infer to the whole and make judgments rashly. Whether it is about people, things, or objects, we must firmly remember this error that is very easy to make. But this does not mean that we should ignore the "point" or think it is not worth paying attention to. "A single spark can start a prairie fire," and the arrival of a revolutionary upsurge is like this. But if we do not pay serious attention to the counter-revolutionary bandits from the beginning and quickly put them out, their spark will also spread. Any spark must be looked at for its essence, whether it is developing, and whether it is worth paying attention to.

Now, I will talk about the main text, divided into two parts:

Opinions on the Formulation and Implementation of Plans

Pay attention to the experience of actual workers; strengthen the connection between scientific research institutions and planning institutions and executive departments; reduce the situation of changing plans midway; strengthen the seriousness of plan implementation; pay attention to preventing malpractices in the formulation and completion of production targets; pay attention to utilizing surplus or discarded materials; gradually utilize local talents.

The first part contributes some opinions on the formulation and implementation of national plans. Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report (hereinafter referred to as the report) raised various views on the issues of national strength and construction, accumulation and consumption in terms of the path of industrialization. I think that in principle, they are all correct. The problem lies in how to specifically arrange things further, for example, saying: "In the raw materials distribution process, the production of essential goods for people's lives should be guaranteed first, and then the infrastructure construction should be arranged." Correct. Saying: "The improvement of people's lives and the increase in purchasing power... depend on the development of agriculture and light industry." Correct. The problem lies in how to properly coordinate agriculture and light industry, in terms of people's lives, in space and time, and how to reasonably distinguish between priorities, urgency, and sequence. Where will these answers be obtained from? Certainly not just from books, just from imagination. Of course, we sincerely want to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, but at the same time, we must pay attention to the opinions of our actual workers in China, who have a lot of correct answers in their minds. How will the planning institutions fully and extensively absorb the valuable experience they have gained from actual work from the cadres, workers, and peasants of various departments, regions, bureaus, places, fields, societies, and factories in a zoned and layered manner? Too troublesome, right! We are not afraid, we have to find a way. I know that planning institutions regularly investigate and understand the situation at the grassroots level. Very good! I hope to continue to do so seriously. On July 2, 1945, in Yan'an, Chairman Mao instructed me to learn from workers, peasants, and ordinary people. I wrote it on the booklet "Returning from Yan'an." But it was not deeply written in my mind. After five years of work in the Ministry of Light Industry, I deeply believe that this sentence is really correct.

I will give an example. At the National People's Congress in 1956, I personally heard a famous labor model report in public that the organization promoted the use of double-wheeled double-share plows and required their cooperative to purchase them. He recognized that their farmland was loamy soil, and this kind of plow was heavy and would not work. The organization, under the pressure of orders from above, still required them to spend a lot of money to purchase them, resulting in failure and great losses. I also heard representatives from many provinces and regions at the conference report on the suffering of blindly pursuing progress and not investigating the actual situation from the higher authorities. Can we still not humbly learn from the peasants? We must accept the valuable lessons learned from failure.

I hope that the planning institutions will first strengthen the connection with the executive departments and executive regions; the report also proposes various principles on how to properly arrange the human aspect, which are all correct. The same method should be used to improve the correctness of the plan and to stipulate various specific measures.

I also hope that scientific research institutions will strengthen their connection with planning institutions and executive departments. I used to have exchanges and contacts with scientific research institutions in the Ministry of Light Industry, which was beneficial to both parties. Now science has greatly progressed. All aspects are more and better connected to prepare for the new and great contributions of scientists to improve the achievements in all aspects of business. The most ideal situation is that all scientific research institutions, planning institutions, executive units, and educational units should be integrated in work on necessary and possible related issues.

Eight years have passed since liberation, and everyone is exploring the construction cause. In the past, there was such a situation, that is, in the middle of the plan, the higher authorities required more or less changes, which inevitably caused considerable economic losses. Of course, it may be due to changes in objective conditions, and changing the plan is a last resort, but it is not very good after all. There has been much more progress in the past few years. I hope and believe that there will be few or no situations of changing the plan midway in the future.

At the same time, I hope that all executive departments and executive regions will improve the seriousness of implementing the plan. In the Ministry of Light Industry, there was a situation where, when a certain light industrial product was correctly implementing the plan of appropriate coordination of national production and sales, a certain region suddenly announced self-production and self-sales without following the prescribed procedures for requesting instructions and reporting, causing chaos in production and sales for a while. This is the localism that the report greatly opposes, believing that it hinders overall planning and appropriate arrangements, and requires all executive units to pay attention to policies and regulations and implement them seriously.

However, if the executive agency finds that the orders issued by the higher authorities are obviously inconsistent with the facts, do not blindly implement them immediately. Instead, it should immediately reflect the actual situation to the higher authorities so that the higher authorities can reconsider, or feel that it is not very consistent with the facts, but it is relative rather than absolute, and it can also be carefully studied, implementing while reflecting the research opinions to the higher authorities. I believe that the higher authorities will also humbly and willingly listen.

Regarding the issue of production targets, I advocate that we should only strive for accuracy when formulating them. We should promote and reward the completion of targets in excess, but we should also pay attention to the malpractices that have occurred individually in the past. The source of the vast majority of production targets is based on the production organs' reporting, and the higher authorities formulate them after reviewing them. Some individual production organs, when reporting output, in order to express production enthusiasm, set the targets too high. The higher authorities originally required an increase of several percent compared to last year, but they felt that it would be better to report more. After reporting, the target was announced. When it came to production, they felt that it was necessary to produce even more than the target. Production was exceeded, but the machine inevitably suffered damage, the health of the employees inevitably suffered, and various problems followed. This is not what the country requires! The country requires excess completion to come from new contributions such as creation, invention, rationalization proposals, and improvement of operating methods, which is in line with the interests of the country. I advocate that it is necessary to conduct a thorough investigation of the reasons for overproduction after receiving the report of excess completion. There is also a very individual situation where, in order to prepare for exceeding the target, the output is deliberately underreported, so that they can steadily receive excess rewards, which is of course absolutely not allowed. I must solemnly state here that the vast majority of those who have achieved over-completion of production tasks in the past have indeed started from a high degree of production enthusiasm and have truly met the interests of the country, and are worthy of respect.

One point that we think is worth paying great attention to is turning waste into useful, and utilizing surplus or discarded material resources. In 1951, when I went to Northeast China to inspect the light industry, I found that the waste liquid flowing out of the papermill wall. The responsible comrade told me that this was a problem. Papermills cannot be without waste liquid, but these waste liquids flowing out greatly harm agricultural production. The engineer told me that this sulfite waste liquid is an extremely valuable raw material for alcohol and also one of the raw materials for feed production. There are simply countless valuable materials that have not been fully utilized or even utilized, and the paper in everyone's hands is one example. Committee member Gu Jingxin's speech advocating that we should no longer burn Fushun bituminous coal without recovering liquid fuel and develop the Fushun shale oil industry is worth paying attention to. I have visited Fushun and would like to solemnly request the State Council and the planning institutions to pay great attention to this suggestion and the utilization of all materials that have great value, or seem small but actually have great value.

Not only material resources, but also a lot of human resources have not been utilized. In August 1956, five agencies, including the Chinese Academy of Sciences, openly recruited scientific and educational workers, which was a very good thing. I hope that various agencies, either separately or jointly, will make a summary of this matter, the problems discovered from it, and the experience gained, and tell everyone. I have received letters from people from more than one place who applied but did not receive a reply. If there are problems or difficulties, they should be answered. I also think that there are still quite a few local talents. As far as I have been in contact with, there are those who are employed but not used for their strengths, so I will not count them for the time being. There are two other categories: one category is older but not physically weakened; the other category is those who have had problems in the past, the matter has been clarified, but they have not been utilized. In addition, some teachers, engineers, etc., although they have reached retirement age, if their abilities can still work, they should also be considered to give them the opportunity to continue to contribute their strength. These are all intellectuals, and of course the situations are inconsistent. In order to unite and mobilize all forces in society, they should be gradually utilized according to the needs of the country.

Opinions on Several Specific Issues

Using local materials is an important way to solve the problem of material supply; pay attention to the study of increasing tobacco production; a little experience in immigration and land reclamation; a little opinion on arranging the future of primary and secondary school students; pay attention to the density of rural schools; every agency and every family should pay attention to saving.

The second part contributes some opinions on several issues raised in the report.

(1) The report mentions using local materials, and I think this is the basic way to solve the problem of material supply. Our ancestors used this method two thousand years ago. Wasn't the Dujiangyan in Sichuan built by Li Bing and his son of the Qin Dynasty? The Minjiang River flows to Guanxian and becomes the inner and outer rivers, and uses wooden forks and bamboo cages filled with pebbles to form a water barrier dam. The great project materials are only these. Pebbles are everywhere, wooden forks are made of alder wood, a special product of Sichuan, which becomes stronger when immersed in water, and bamboo is called "cage bamboo," which can last for a year in water (Cizhu only lasts for half a year), all of which are produced on the riverside and are inexhaustible, so the problem is solved. Du Fu's poem says "Alder forests obstruct the sun, chanting wind leaves, cage bamboo drips dew with smoke." Unexpectedly, the alder wood and cage bamboo used by the engineer also became poetic material for the poet. This is a very good example. I think that for any engineering material, we should first investigate the local products and use them as much as possible, which is also related to saving.

(2) The report mentions the relationship between accumulation and consumption, and asks: "How to give full play to the role of favorable factors?" Is there anything that can be considered? Among consumer goods, there are some that can help accumulate: such as tobacco, as far as I know, cigarette manufacturing factories still have a lot of remaining production capacity. And overseas sales can still be expanded. This product is of great help to national finance. The problem is to increase tobacco production and expand to those areas that meet the conditions and do not encroach on the production areas of grain and cotton. I only provide this example for research.

(3) The report mentions the arrangement of a large amount of labor, which is indeed a very difficult but very urgent problem. I am from Jiangsu, and every agricultural population in Jiangsu, after the land reform and land distribution, is less than one mu in many areas. This is the case in Suzhou, Wuxi, and my birthplace, Chuansha counties. I am very willing to contribute some research materials. After the Xinhai Revolution, I and some friends wanted to absorb some experience from the basic problems of people's livelihood using private forces, and wait for the future to use the national forces to solve the whole problem. I thought about the issue of land reclamation—the report also mentions land reclamation. At that time, I planned to move the surplus farmers from Jiangsu to Northeast China for land reclamation, selected Heilongjiang as the location, and moved some farmers from Chongming and Haimen counties to the north. I gained several experiences in this area, one of which is that if the regions are arranged as A, B, C, and D, it is only appropriate to move the people from region A to region B or C, and then move the people from region C or B to region D, but it is absolutely inappropriate to move the people from region A directly to region D. Of course, at that time, we had no political power, so there were many difficulties and we finally gave up. (From 1915 to 1919) Today, the situation is very different. Is it still worth considering as a reference?

(4) The report says: We must look forward and backward, and cannot only do the balance of the current year, which is very right. I would also like to contribute a little experience on this point. A large number of primary school graduates want to enter middle school, so we should run enough middle schools to accommodate them. Can the problem be solved? No. What should we do after graduating from middle school? Can we run enough universities? The report makes it very clear. "Not all can be promoted to the next level step by step," there is still a problem in the middle. According to our past practical experience, one engineer in a factory must be matched with more than ten technicians. Engineers are trained by universities, where do technicians come from? If a part of the middle schools are changed into schools for training technicians, and the number of technicians needed in a certain industry in a few years is calculated clearly, then when some graduates graduate from middle school, they will go to university, and some will serve in a certain factory. If the plan is correct at first, and the contact is sufficient in peacetime, and people get things and things get people, won't both sides' problems be solved? The government has run many technical schools and technical training classes. I hope that they will be better matched with the source and future of the students. Because the report mentioned it, I provide the above opinions for reference. Of course, ideological education must also be given great importance. I strongly agree with Committee member Che Xiangchen's speech.

(5) The report asks, "How about primary and secondary schools being dispersed in rural areas?" I think it is right. Running schools in rural areas and towns is different because they need to be coordinated with their living environment. This has already been concluded. One point, how to distribute primary schools in rural areas, is worth studying. Rural areas are relatively open, and in order to ensure that every school-age child can attend school and commute to school (day school), the density of school distribution is a problem. From 1915 to 1925, China had a National Education Association Federation, which held meetings in rotation in various provinces and regions every year. In 1915 and 1916, discussions were held on the issue of setting up schools in rural areas, and the practical experience of running schools in various provinces and regions was absorbed. It was believed that schools should be set up in rural areas by district, and the density of school location should be limited to no more than two li from the farmer's home. So that every child can go to school, and the government is responsible for setting up schools in this area in order. Many places were practicing this at that time. Of course, at that time, politics was not on track, and nothing would have good results. Now the situation is very different. It seems that the issue of rural school density is still worth paying attention to.

(6) The report mentions comprehensive consideration and also mentions careful calculation, both of which are correct. When considering issues, it is necessary to start from a comprehensive perspective and formulate plans, which is necessary. But when implementing, for example, increasing production and practicing economy, while paying attention to the big places, we must also pay attention to trivial things. To give one or two examples, the People's Daily on February 16 published "After Checking Inventory Materials, Jiangsu, Shanxi, and Tianjin Discovered a Large Number of Underreported Steel, Wood, and Cement." The government is already dealing with this matter. I think it is also worth conducting a universal and serious inspection. Recently, the government called for savings. What I have personally contacted is that a certain reception agency, by saving a little, saves 200 jin of coal every day, which is 6,000 jin a month; a certain family, which originally used 100 jin of coal every day, saves 25 jin of coal every day by saving a little, which is 750 jin a month. If every agency is like this, and every family is like this, just coal alone is already quite considerable. This is the result of careful calculation.

In a nutshell, the main point is to unanimously accept Chairman Mao's instruction to "increase production and practice economy."

Only by everyone increasing production and practicing economy can we overcome the excess of demand over supply and smoothly and quickly build socialism.

If everyone starts from themselves to increase production and practice economy, how great will this impact be?

The draft of the speech was written here, and I just heard Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech. He advocated launching a nationwide movement to increase production and practice economy in 1957. He put forward specific methods for agriculture, industry, transportation, commerce, government, army, factories, enterprises, and schools. He also said that China has a large population, as long as everyone saves a little, it will be a huge number.

Then where do we start? Every member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the local committees, every member of the democratic parties, people's organizations, ethnic minorities, and democratic people from all walks of life participating in the CPPCC, and specially invited people, let's all participate in this movement, okay? I believe that everyone is willing to start from themselves.

I also believe that among the China Democratic National Construction Association, the patriotic industrialists and businessmen comrades, while saving, are also willing to repay the country with their surplus financial resources. The People's Daily on February 19 published that many factories and enterprises in Shenyang have set up primary schools on their own, which is a very good example. Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report also mentioned the method of primary schools being run by the people and subsidized by the government. How serious and urgent is the problem of enrollment this year! I hope that the education administrative organs will consider and formulate a method as soon as possible, and I believe that everyone is happy to contribute their financial resources in response. This can also reduce some of the burden on the national finance.

I personally am willing to respond to the government's call, follow my comrades, and practice economy as much as possible from myself and my family, so as to make a "small contribution" to the country. (Attached picture)

    大家都来参加增产节约运动
    黄炎培副主席的发言
    “百花齐放、百家争鸣”号召下我的建议：只有提高计划正确性，大家增产节约从自己做起，才能克服目前求过于供的现象。
    我接受了毛主席“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的号召，听取了李富春副总理关于第二个五年计划的报告，结合了我平时的感想，贡献一些意见。
    新中国在蓬蓬勃勃地进行社会主义建设，一切高速度不断发展中间，表现在面前的几乎普遍地存在着的一种重大矛盾现象，就是供不应求。
    人民生活改善，购买力提高，对饮食品、服用品、商品等种种需要增加了。
    工人工作热情普遍地提高，提前和超额完成了生产指标，对原材料、机器和一切工具等种种需要增加了。
    合作化以后的农村对肥料——化学肥料，农具——新式农具等种种需要增加了。
    人民就学能力提高，对学校、教师、教育用品等种种需要增加了。
    人民就医能力提高，对医院、医师、一切医务人员、药品等种种需要增加了。
    交通运输率提高，对铁路、公路、车辆、船舶等种种需要增加了。
    越来越多的新建筑，工人、材料、工具一切需要增加了。
    情况是列举不了的。生产尽管增加，而且增加得很多，供应还是不够，是紧张的，但是稳定的。
    谁都知道，这一切一切不是坏而是好，是必经的过程，是不可避免的现象，可是这种种情况用什么方法来改变呢？毛主席经常指示我们：基本很好，困难不少，但可以克服的。我们下决心来克服它。
    李富春副总理报告中提出不少问题，征求答案，根据我解放以来和解放以前亲身接触所得的经验，提出一些意见分别供负责同志们参考。所以只供参考，为的是我没有掌握全面资料，是无法根据全面观察和分析来提意见的。但即使是根据片面情况，如果情况是真实的，我是本着平时知无不言、言无不尽鲠直的习惯，还是愿意尽量贡献。
    首先提出几个名词，加以说明，这都是我自己认为容易犯错误的：
    ⒈ 经验和经验主义  经验主义是要不得的。为的是社会是在演变、在发展，过去的方法现在不一定适用；一个地区有一个地区的具体情况，甲地的经验对乙地不一定完全适用。如果不考虑现在和当地的情况，执着了过去和某地惯用的方法，老不改变，这是经验主义，这是错误。但经验不一定没有价值，就是要看清楚当时当地的情况，是否还适用，如果还是适用，而且很适用，或者部分修正后还是很适用，这些经验那就是宝贵的经验了。经验主义必须反对，但反对了经验主义而抹杀一切经验，那又错误了。
    ⒉本位和本位主义  工作人员考虑问题时常常先考虑和多考虑他本位的问题，这是不可避免的。越是热心于职务，可能他对本位的工作考虑得更多更切。这也不能说是坏，问题是在只争取本位利益，不顾到整体利益，甚至不顾政策命令的规定，那是不行的。还有只知道自己的本位，不照顾别人的本位，造成利害冲突，彼此磨擦不合作，这或轻或重的本位主义，都是资产阶级社会恶劣作风的残余存在，必须完全克服。
    ⒊片面和全面观点  任何事物不是孤立的。看事物不从全面观察、全面分析，执着了某一点来推论到整体，轻率地加以判断，是万万不可以的。不论对人、观事、对物，都要牢牢记着这种很容易犯的错误。但并不是说对于“点”不要理会，或认为不值得理会。“星星之火可以燎原”，革命高潮的到来，是这样的。但如对反革命匪帮不从初发时认真注意，迅加扑灭，它的星星之火也会蔓延开来的。任何一点火，要看它实质是什么，是否在发展，值得注意。
    现在，我谈到本文了，分两部分来说：
  对制订和执行计划的意见
    重视实际工作者的经验；加强科学研究机构同计划机构、执行部门的联系；减少中途变更计划的情况；加强执行计划的严肃性；注意防止制订和完成生产指标中的流弊；重视利用剩余或废置物资；逐步利用各地遗才。
    第一部分贡献一些对于国家计划的制订和执行的意见。李富春副总理报告（以下简称报告）在关于工业化道路问题上，对国力和建设、积累和消费提出种种看法，我认为从原则上说来，全是对的。问题在于进一层如何具体地布置，例如说：“原材料分配程序，紧张时应首先保证人民生活必需品的生产，然后安排基建。”对。说： “人民生活的改善和购买力的提高……决定于农业和轻工业的发展。”对。问题在人民生活的农业、轻工业，怎样适当地配合空间、时间，怎样合理地分别轻重、缓急、先后来进行。这些答案将从那里取得呢？决不是光凭书本，光凭想像，我们当然诚心诚意地要学习苏联的先进经验，同时必须重视我国的实际工作者的意见，他们有一肚子正确的答案。计划机构将怎样分区地分层地向各部门、各地区、各局所、各场、各社、各厂干部、工人、农民充分地广泛地吸取他们亲身从实际工作得来的宝贵经验呢？太麻烦吧！我们不怕，要想办法。我知道计划机构对基层情况，是经常调查了解的。很好！我希望继续认真进行。1945年7月2日我在延安，毛主席指示我向工人农民老百姓们学习。我写上“延安归来”小册子上了。但没有深刻地写在脑海里。经过了五年轻工业部工作，我才深深相信这句话真是正确。
    我举一个例子，1956年全国人民代表大会，我在小组上亲听到一位著名的劳动模范，当众报告组织上推行双轮双铧犁要求他们的合作社购用，他认识到他们的农田是涂泥，这种犁重量大，当不了。组织上迫于上级的命令，还是要求化了相当多钱购用，结果失败，损失很大。我还听到大会上有好多省区代表同样地报告吃上级盲目追求进步不考察实际的苦。我们还能不虚心向农民学习吗？我们必须接受从失败得来的宝贵的经验教训。
    我希望计划机构首先和执行部门、执行地区加强联系；报告还对于人的方面如何适当安排，所提出关于原则性的种种主张，都对。同样需要用上开方法来提高计划的正确性，并规定种种具体办法。
    我还希望科学研究机构和计划机构、执行各部门加强联系。我在轻工业部曾经和科学研究机构彼此交往联系，这是双方有利的。现在科学大大进步了。各方面更多地更好地联系起来，准备迎接科学家新的伟大的贡献，来提高各方面业务上的成就。最理想是科学研究机构、计划机构、执行各单位，以及教育各单位所有彼此有关问题，就必要和可能在工作上打成一片。
    解放到今八年，对于建设事业大家都在摸索中。过去曾经有这样一种情况，即进行计划到中途，上级要求或多或少的变更，这在经济上不免受到相当损失。当然，可能由于客观条件的变化，变更计划自是不得已的办法，但到底是不很好的。这几年进步多多了。我希望、也相信今后少有或竟没有这中途变更计划的情况。
    我同时希望各执行部门、各执行地区提高对执行计划的严肃性。我在轻工业部曾经发生一种情况，在某一轻工业品正在正确地执行全国产销适当配合的计划时，某一地区并没有按照请示、报告的规定手续，忽然宣布自产自销，引起一时间产销上的混乱，这就是报告上所大大反对的认为妨害统筹兼顾适当安排的本位主义，要求任何执行单位重视政策法令，严肃执行。
    但是执行机构如发见上级发下来的命令有和事实显然不切合的地方，不要立即盲目地执行。而宜立即将实际情况反映上级，让上级复加考虑，或者感觉到和事实不很切合，但还是相对而不是绝对，也可以经过慎重研究，一面执行，一面将研究意见反映给上级，我相信上级也虚心乐于听取的。
    我对生产指标问题，主张制订时只应当力求正确。对于超额完成，应该提倡、奖励的，但对于过去曾经个别发生过的流弊，也应该注意。绝大多数生产指标的来源，是根据生产机关开报，上级据以审查后订出来的。个别的生产机关，在开报产额时，为了表示生产热情，把指标开得偏高，上级原来要求比去年提高百分之几，觉得报上去时更多些为好。报上去了，指标宣布了。到生产时觉得必须比指标还要多些为好，生产超额了，但机器不免受到损害，职工健康不免受到影响，种种问题相应而来了。这那里是国家所要求的呢！国家所要求超额完成，是通过创造、发明、合理化建议，改进操作方法种种新的贡献而来，才是符合国家的利益。我主张接到超额完成的报告，切实调查一下超额生产的原因，是有必要的。还有一种极个别的情况，为了准备超额，故意将产额压低开报，便稳稳地获得超额奖励，这当然是绝对不许的。我在这里必须郑重说明，过去绝大多数获得超额完成生产任务的，确是从高度生产热情出发，做到真正符合国家的利益，是值得尊敬的。
    有一点认为我们值得非常重视的，就是化无用为有用，利用剩余或废置的物力。1951年我去东北视察轻工业，发见造纸厂墙外流出的废液，负责同志告我，这是一个问题，纸厂不能没有废液，但这些废液流出去大大地妨害农田生产，工程师告诉我这亚硫酸废液是极宝贵的酒精原料，也是饲料制造原料之一。像这些没有充分利用甚至还没有利用过的珍贵物资，简直列举不了，我们人人手里的纸张，就是一例。顾敬心委员发言主张不要再燃烧未经回收液体燃料的抚顺烟煤和发展抚顺页岩油工业，是值得重视的。我是去抚顺参观过的，愿向国务院、向计划机构郑重提请大大注意这一建议和一切具有重大价值，或者看来微小而实际具有重大价值的物资利用。
    岂但物力，还有不少没有被利用的人力。1956年8月中国科学院等五个机关公开招聘科学和教育工作人员是一件很好的事情。希望各机关或分或合地把这件事情经过和从这上边发见的问题、获得的经验作出一个总结，告诉大家。我所接到人民来信，不止一地一人有应聘而没有下文的，如有问题或有困难，应当答复他们。我还推想到各地遗才还是不少，就我所接触，在职而用非其长，姑且不计。还有两类：一类是年龄较大的但体力并没有衰弱；一类是历史上有过问题的，事情已经弄清楚了，但还没有被利用。还有，有的教师、工程师等虽然已达退休年龄，但如果他们的能力还能够工作，也应考虑让他们有继续贡献力量的机会。这些都是知识分子，当然情况是不一致的。为了团结、调动社会上一切力量，应当根据国家的需要，逐步利用。对几个具体问题的意见
    就地取材是解决材料供应问题的重要办法；注意研究增加烟叶生产；移民开荒的一点经验；关于安排中小学生出路的一点意见；注意农村设校密度问题；个个机关、个个家庭都要注意节约。
    第二部分，贡献一些对于报告上提出的几个问题的意见。
    （1）报告提到就地取材，我认为这是解决材料供应问题的基本办法。这办法二千年前我们的祖先曾经采用。四川的都江堰不是秦朝李冰父子搞起来的么？岷江流到灌县成内外江，用杩杈和满装卵石的竹笼排列成挡水坝。伟大的工程材料，只是这些。卵石满地都是，杩杈用桤木，四川特产，入水反坚，竹名“笼竹”，入水可经一年（慈竹只半年），都是江边产生，取之不尽，问题就解决了。杜甫诗“桤林碍日吟风叶，笼竹和烟滴露梢”。料不到工程师采用的桤木、笼竹同时给诗人做了诗料。这是一个很好的范例。我以为任何工程材料，先调查本地产物，尽可能利用，这也是于节约有关的。
    （2）报告提到积累和消费关系，问： “如何充分发挥有利因素的作用？”有一点是不是可以考虑？消费品中间有可以帮助积累的：如烟，我所知道卷烟制造厂设备还有不少剩余的生产力。而国外销路还可以扩充。这一产品对国家财政是有很大帮助的。问题是在增加烟叶生产，向那些地区扩充，既符合条件，又不侵占粮食和棉花等产地。我只把这个例子提供研究。
    （3）报告说到大量劳动的安排，这确是很困难、但很迫切的问题。我是江苏人，江苏每一农业人口，土改分地，很多地区不满一亩。苏州、无锡和我出生的川沙各县都是这样。我很愿贡献一些研究资料。辛亥革命以后，我和一部分朋友想从民生疾苦基本问题上，用私人的力量吸取些经验，待将来用国家力量来整个解决。就想到开荒问题，——报告也提到开荒。当时计划移江苏过剩的农民到东北去开荒，选地黑龙江，移崇明、海门两县部分农民北迁。在这上边取得了几种经验，其中一种，假如把地区排成甲、乙、丙、丁，只宜把甲区的民移到乙或丙区，再移丙或乙区的民到丁区，而决不宜把甲区的民直接移丁区。当然，那时候，我们是没有政权的，所以，困难重重，终于放弃。（从1915年到1919年）今天情况大大不同了。是否还值得作为参考呢？
    （4）报告说：要瞻前顾后，不能只做当年的平衡，极是、极是。我在这点上也愿贡献一点经验。有大量小学毕业生要升中学，那末就办足够的中学来容纳是了。问题能解决么？不能。中学毕业怎么办呢？能不能办足够的大学么？报告说得很清楚了。“不能全部逐级升学”，中间还存在一问题。依我们过去实际经验，工厂工程师一人，需要配合的技术员必不止十人，工程师让大学来培养，技术员那里来呢？如果把一部分中学改做培养技术员的学校，某种工业若干年后需要多少技术员，一切都计算清楚，那末到中学毕业时某些毕业生升大学，某些到某种工厂服务。先时计划得正确，平时联系得足够，人得事了，事得人了，不是双方问题都解决么？政府已办不少技术学校、技术训练班，希望和学生的来源、出路配合得更好些。因为报告说到，所以把上边的意见提供参考。自然，思想教育，还须十分重视。我对车向忱委员发言很同意。
    （5）报告问到“中小学校多分散在农村”怎样？我认为对的。农村和城镇办学是不同的，为的是需要配合它们的生活环境。这些已经有定论了。有一点，小学在农村中如何分布，值得研究。农村地区比较空旷，要使个个学童都得就学，而且都得通学（走读），因此学校分布地点的疏密成问题了。中国从1915年至1925年曾经设有全国教育会联合会，每年就各省区轮流开会。在1915、16年为了农村设学问题展开讨论，吸取各省区办学实际经验，认为农村宜分区设学，设学地点的疏密，以农民家距离学校最远不超过二华里为限。使每个儿童都得走向学校，在这区域内学校由政府负责次第设立，当时许多地方是实行的。当然，那时候政治不上轨道，什么都不会有好结果。现在情况大大不同了。似乎农村设学密度问题，还值得注意。
    （6）报告说到全面考虑，也说到精打细算，都是正确的。考虑问题，必须从全面出发，制订计划，这点是必要的。但到执行时例如增产节约，注意到大的地方，还须注意到琐屑的事物。举一两个例子，2月16日人民日报载“查清库存物资，江苏、山西、天津发现大批漏报的钢材、木材、水泥”。这件事政府已在处理了。我认为还值得普遍地认真检查一下。最近政府号召节约，我所亲身接触的，某一个招待机关，节约一下，每天省掉煤二百斤，一个月六千斤了；某一个家庭，原来每天用煤一百斤，节约一下，每天省却煤二十五斤，一个月七百五十斤了。如果个个机关这样，个个家庭这样，只是煤一种，已经大有可观了。这是精打细算的结果。
    千言万语，归束起来，主要一点，就是一致接受毛主席指示“增产节约”。
    只有大家增产节约，才能克服供不应求，顺利地加速地建设社会主义。
    增产节约如果人人从自己做起，这个影响将多么大。
    发言稿写到这里，恰听到陈云副总理的发言，他主张1957年展开一个全国范围的增产节约运动。他对农业、工业、运输、商业、政府、军队、工厂、企业、学校各方面都提出了具体的办法，他还说：中国人口多，只要每人节约出一点来，就是一个庞大的数目。
    那末我们从那里做起呢？中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会、地方委员会每个成员，参加政协的各民主党派、各人民团体、各少数民族每个成员，以及各界民主人士，特邀人士大家来参加这个运动，好不好？我相信人人愿意从自己做起的。
    我还相信中国民主建国会中间，爱国的工商业家同志们一面节约，一面还愿意把有余的财力报效国家。2月19日人民日报登载沈阳许多工厂、企业单位纷纷自办小学，是很好的例子。李富春副总理报告也提到小学校民办公助办法，今年升学问题多么严重迫切！希望教育行政机关从速考虑制定出办法来，相信大家乐于贡献出财力来响应。这样还可以减轻些国家财政负担。
    我个人愿意响应政府号召，追随同志们之后，从我自己、从我家庭尽可能厉行节约，从而对国家作“涓埃”的贡献。（附图片）
