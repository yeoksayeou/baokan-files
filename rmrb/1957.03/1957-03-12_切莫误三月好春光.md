    Don't Waste the Good Spring Time of March
    By our reporter Zhu Bo
    Editor's Note
    The field management work in Lintong County is progressing very slowly. The county party committee leaders underestimate the importance of March, a crucial time for a good harvest throughout the year. The spring plowing production plan is vague, and the leadership is generalized. Many cadres who went to the countryside did not grasp the key to increasing production at that time. The lesson of Lintong should be learned by all regions. Don't waste the good spring time of March, and hurry up to seize the spring plowing production!
    Throughout the years, March has been the most intense stage of spring plowing production in Lintong County. This is something that local farmers are very familiar with. According to local farmers: "Time is most precious in March, one day should be used as two or three days!" Because the field management work of summer grain crops, such as spring irrigation, topdressing, weeding, and hoeing, must be mostly completed in this month. The preparation work for spring sowing, such as cotton field preparation, fertilization, irrigation, and seed treatment, must also be completed in this month, otherwise it will affect the progress of spring sowing. Especially this March, these tasks are even more concentrated than in previous years, because Lintong County was somewhat slack in winter production last year. Many of the winter wheat field management tasks that should have been completed last year were not completed. For example, winter irrigation work was only 60% completed; fertilization work was also very poor, with only 60% of the base fertilizer applied, and many agricultural cooperatives applied fertilizer to only about 30% of the wheat field area; most of the cotton fields were not ploughed in winter and need to be ploughed now. Therefore, the tasks in March are more arduous than in previous years.
    Judging from the current situation in Lintong County, the above-mentioned tasks are not progressing well. Whether it is in wheat field management or spring sowing preparation, the action is very slow. The county has more than 200,000 mu of irrigable wheat fields, most of which have not been irrigated. In the county's Xin Feng, Yanliang, Xiangqiao and other districts, there are more than 70,000 mu of irrigable wheat fields, and only more than 1,000 mu have been irrigated so far. In the county's main irrigation area, Yujin District, there are more than 100,000 mu of irrigable wheat fields. The Jinghui Canal started releasing water on February 25, but most agricultural cooperatives have not yet carried out spring irrigation. For example, Yujin Agricultural Cooperative has nearly 3,000 mu of paddy wheat, and not a single mu has been irrigated. The main reason for the lack of irrigation is that the resident cadres and the agricultural cooperative management committee have not arranged spring irrigation work at all. The masses reflected that the members wanted to irrigate the land, but who could make their own decision to irrigate the land without the instructions of the management committee? Especially those experienced members, are particularly dissatisfied with the current phenomenon. Every time they go to the field to carry soil or repair ditches, they always dig up the soil in the wheat field to take a look; when they see that the dry soil layer in the wheat field is more than two inches thick, they say with dissatisfaction: The land is so dry that it is hindering the wheat from tillering, I don't know why they haven't irrigated the wheat yet! In previous years, spring irrigation would have started long ago.
    Other tasks such as fertilization, spring harrowing, spring rolling, and spring weeding are also progressing very slowly. At this time last year, the wheat fields that should have been topdressed had already been topdressed; this year, there are still not many manure deliveries, and most of the manure deliveries are elderly members. For example, in Yujin District, only more than 40,000 mu have been topdressed since the beginning of spring, accounting for more than 30% of the total wheat field area in the district. Jitian Township (the county's key point) in the district has seen a slackening in fertilizer accumulation and fertilization work. Some cooperatives believe that there is no source of fertilizer and do not plan to fertilize the wheat fields. For example, Tanwang Agricultural Cooperative has only fertilized 50% of the area (most of which was the base fertilizer applied last winter), and the cooperative leaders plan not to topdress the wheat fields any more. As for the spring harrowing, spring rolling, and spring weeding of wheat fields, the progress is even worse. According to the statistics of Xinfeng Township, Xinfeng District, this township has nine agricultural cooperatives, with a total of more than 23,000 mu of wheat fields. In February, only 510 mu of wheat fields were rolled; according to the statistics from March 1 to March 3 for three days, only two cooperatives in the township carried out spring rolling, and the other seven cooperatives did not carry out it. This township is also a key township in the county and has done better work in the past. The situation in this township can reflect the situation in other agricultural cooperatives. The local masses reflected: "Spring starts at the beginning of the sixth nine (the beginning of spring before the sixth nine), and耕牛ploughs all over the fields," if it was last year, the wheat fields would have been rolled by this time; now, you can't even see the shadow of an ox!
    According to past experience, cotton fields should be deeply ploughed last winter, and this spring the main tasks are shallow ploughing and harrowing. However, Lintong County did not pay close attention to cotton field cultivation last winter, and the area of deep ploughing was not large. According to the statistics of Yujin District, the main cotton-producing area in the county, only more than 5,900 mu of cotton fields were cultivated last winter. As a result, the task of cotton field preparation this spring is even more arduous. According to technical requirements, all cotton fields should be cultivated before the end of February, and spring irrigation, harrowing, rolling, seed selection and other tasks should be carried out in March. However, the cotton field preparation work here is progressing very slowly. According to the results of the inspection by Yujin District, only more than 30,000 mu of cotton fields have been cultivated so far, accounting for about 25% of the total cotton field area in the district; the fertilized area is 25,000 mu, accounting for 21% of the cotton field area. The task of cultivating and fertilizing the land has to be postponed to March. Whether the preparation work before cotton field sowing can be completed in March is a matter of concern to many people. Some experienced cotton farmers said that cotton should be planted in early April this year, and if we don't hurry up, it will be delayed!
    It should be said that Lintong County's spring plowing production has achieved results, but why did the above situation occur? The main reason is that the county party committee leaders do not have enough understanding of the important time of March. Whether the field management work in March can be completed directly affects whether a good summer grain harvest can be achieved this year. This is the experience of the masses throughout the years. This year, the county plans to have a total grain output of more than 278.8 million catties, of which summer grain accounts for more than 198.8 million catties. Completing the summer grain production increase plan is equivalent to completing more than 71% of the annual grain harvest plan; it also plays a decisive role in completing this year's overall harvest task. However, Lintong County leaders did not clearly realize this problem; therefore, they did not raise the issue of attaching importance to the work in March throughout the county. They only made general arrangements for the spring plowing production plan, without specifically arranging the spring plowing production work in March. The spring plowing production plans of districts, townships and agricultural cooperatives also have the problem of generalization.
    In this year's spring production, Lintong County leaders and district and township cadres have gone deeper than in previous years. However, what should we focus on after going down? This issue has not yet been resolved. For example, some leaders have devoted their main energy to water conservancy construction after going deep, while neglecting the management of wheat fields and the preparation of cotton fields; some leaders have grabbed everything after going down, while neglecting the field management work in spring. As a result, the field management work that could have been completed on schedule has been delayed.
    At present, if county-level leaders can quickly take charge of wheat field management and summer sowing preparation, and advance the work that can be done in advance as much as possible, the slow phenomenon will be quickly corrected, and it is still possible to complete the field management work in March on schedule. In this year's spring production, the enthusiasm of the masses is very high, which is a reliable force to correct any shortcomings.

### 切莫误三月好春光

    切莫误三月好春光
    本报记者　朱波
    编者按
    临潼县的田间管理工作进展十分迟缓。县委领导人员对三月这个同当地全年丰产有极大关系的时令估计不足，春耕生产计划笼统，领导一般化，不少干部下乡以后也没有抓住当地当前的增产关键。临潼这一教训，值得各地吸取。不要误了三月好春光，赶快把春耕生产抓紧吧！
    历年来，三月都是临潼县春耕生产最紧张的阶段。这是当地农民非常熟悉的事情。按照当地农民说法：“三月里时间最宝贵，一天要当两天三天用哩！”因为，夏季粮食作物的田间管理工作，如春灌、施追肥、耘耙、锄草等，绝大部分都要集中在这一个月来完成。春播的准备工作，如棉田整理、施肥、灌溉以及种子的处理等，也要集中在这一个月来完成，否则就会影响春播工作的进行。尤其是今年三月，这些工作比往年更加集中，这是因为临潼县去年冬季生产中有些松劲。去年，应该完成的冬季麦田管理工作，很多都没有完成。例如冬灌工作，只完成了60％；施肥工作也很差，施底肥的只占60％，有很多农业社施肥只占麦田面积的30％左右；棉田大部分没有冬耕，需要在目前进行翻耕。因此，三月份的任务比往年更加繁重了。
    从临潼县目前的情况来看，上述各种工作进行的情况很不好，无论是在麦田管理上，或者是春播准备工作上，行动都很迟缓。该县有可灌的麦田二十多万亩，目前大部分没有进行灌溉。该县新丰、阎良、相桥等区，可灌溉的麦田有七万余亩，目前浇过的只有一千多亩。在该县主要灌溉区——雨金区，可灌溉的麦田十多万亩，泾惠渠在二月二十五日就开始放水了，但是，大部分农业社还没有进行春灌工作。例如雨金农业社，近三千亩水地麦子，一亩也没有灌溉。没有灌溉的主要原因是驻社干部和农业社管理委员会根本就没有布置春灌工作。群众反映：社员们倒是想浇地，但是，没有管委会的指示，谁能自作主张浇地呢？特别是那些有经验的社员，对目前这种现象特别不满。他们每次到地里拉土或修水渠的时候，总要扒开麦田里的土看一看；当看到麦田的干土层已经两寸多厚的时候，就不满意地说：地干的都碍着小麦分头了，不知道为啥还不浇麦！往年这时候春灌早开始了。
    其它如施肥、春耙、春耱、春锄等工作，进行的也很迟缓。在去年这时候，应该施追肥的麦田早就施过了；今年这时候，送粪的还不多见，有些送粪的也多半是上了年纪的老社员。例如雨金区，入春以来到现在施追肥的只有四万多亩，占该区麦田总面积30％多。该区北田乡（县的重点）积肥工作和施肥工作已经出现了松劲现象。有些社认为没有肥源，不打算给麦田施肥了。如滩王农业社，施肥面积只有50％（其中大部分是去年冬季施的基肥），社领导上就打算不再给麦田施追肥了。至于麦田的春耙、春耱、春锄等工作，进行的就更差了。根据新丰区新丰乡统计，这个乡共有九个农业社，共有两万三千多亩麦田，二月份耱的麦田只有五百一十亩；三月一日到三日三天的统计，全乡只有两个社进行春耱，其它七个社都没有进行。这个乡也是县里的重点乡，已往工作较好，从这个乡的情况可以看出其它农业社的情况。当地群众反映：“春打六九头（六九以前立春），耕牛遍地走”，如果在去年，这时候麦田就耱完了；现在，还看不到牛的影子哩！
    根据往年的经验，棉田在去年冬季就要深耕，今年春季主要是浅耕和耙耱等工作。但是，临潼县去冬对棉田耕作抓的不紧，深耕的面积不大。据该县主要产棉区——雨金区统计，去冬耕过的棉田只有五千九百多亩。这样一来，今年春季的棉田整理的任务就更繁重了。根据技术要求，在二月底以前就要把棉田全部耕完，三月份要进行春灌、耙、耱、选种等工作。但是，这里的棉田整理工作进行的非常迟缓，据雨金区检查的结果来看，目前已耕过的棉田只有三万多亩，占该区棉田总面积25％左右；施肥面积有二万五千亩，占棉田面积21％。耕地施肥等任务也不得不推迟到三月份来进行。三月份能否完成棉田播种前的准备工作，已是很多人所忧虑的一件事。一些有经验的棉农说，今年四月初就要种棉花，如果再不抓紧就要误事了！
    应该说临潼县春耕生产是有成绩的，但是，为什么发生了上述情况呢？主要原因是县委领导干部对三月这个重要的时令认识不足。三月田间管理工作能否完成直接影响着今年夏粮能否丰收。这是历年来群众的经验。该县今年计划粮食总产量是二亿七千八百多万斤，其中夏粮占了一亿九千八百多万斤。完成夏粮增产计划，就等于完成全年粮食丰产计划的71％以上；对完成今年的全面丰产任务也起着决定性的作用。然而，临潼县领导人员并没有明确认识到这个问题；因此，也就没有在全县提出重视三月份工作的问题。他们只是笼统地安排春耕生产计划，而没有具体地安排三月份的春耕生产工作。区、乡和农业社的春耕生产计划，也都有一般化的毛病。
    在今年春季生产中，临潼县领导人员和区乡干部，都比往年深入了。但是，下去之后主要抓什么？这个问题还没有解决。例如有些领导人员深入下去之后，把主要精力放在兴修水利工作上，而忽视了对麦田管理和棉田的整理工作；有的领导同志下去后东抓一把西抓一把，而忽视了春季的田间管理工作。这样，就使本来可以如期完成的田间管理工作拖了下来。
    目前，如果县级领导人员能够迅速地把麦田管理、夏播准备工作抓起来，并把可提前做的工作尽可能地提前来进行，迟缓现象将会很快纠正过来，三月份的田间管理工作如期完成还是可能的。在今年的春季生产中，群众情绪非常高涨，这是纠正任何缺点的可靠的力量。
