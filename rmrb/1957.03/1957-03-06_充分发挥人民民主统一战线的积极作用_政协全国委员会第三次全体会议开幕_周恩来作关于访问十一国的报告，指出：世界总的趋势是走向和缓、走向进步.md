Xinhua News Agency, March 5th. Premier Zhou Enlai, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), and Premier of the State Council, said today, "The general trend of the world is towards détente and progress."

The Third Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference opened at 2:30 this afternoon in the CPPCC Auditorium in Beijing. Zhou Enlai delivered a "Report on His Visits to Eleven Countries in Asia and Europe." He reported on the results of his recent foreign visits and spoke about the current international situation and China's foreign policy. He said that the forces of peace are constantly growing, and the forces of war are becoming increasingly isolated. As long as socialist countries, nationalist countries, and all peace-loving countries and peoples unite and persist in their struggle, lasting world peace can be achieved.

Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China and Honorary Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and other state leaders attended today's meeting. A total of 621 committee members, including newly added members, attended this plenary session.

Executive Chairman Soong Ching Ling announced the opening of the meeting. She said that in the past few days before the conference, we participated in the enlarged meeting of the Supreme State Conference and listened to Chairman Mao Zedong's speech. In this plenary session, we will follow his teachings, fully discuss various important issues, conduct criticism and self-criticism, and make our meeting a success. She said that Premier Zhou Enlai visited eleven countries for nearly three months, traveling more than 100,000 miles, and was warmly welcomed by the people of various countries, making outstanding contributions to strengthening the unity of the socialist camp and enhancing the friendship between the people of our country and the people of Asian countries. We hail this great achievement and express our highest respect to him.

Zhou Enlai then began his long report. He said that this foreign visit has achieved the goals of seeking friendship, seeking peace, and seeking knowledge.

Zhou Enlai said that the visits to the four socialist countries have made us even more convinced of the superiority of the socialist system. The economies of socialist countries are booming day by day. The friendly and mutually beneficial relations between socialist countries are being further improved and strengthened. Looking at the past period as a whole, in socialist countries, achievements are always fundamental. With the accumulation of experience and the test of practice, socialist countries will be able to better adjust the contradictions within the people, so that these contradictions do not turn into antagonistic contradictions, and so that we can better overcome difficulties in our work and reduce errors in our work.

He said that during this visit, we also expressed our deep desire to further strengthen the unity of socialist countries. This desire has resonated in every socialist country visited. Socialist countries are working together to improve mutual relations and strengthen unity.

He said that our socialist countries will never expand outwards, and will never commit aggression against other countries. We are willing to mutually guarantee non-aggression and peaceful coexistence with imperialist countries. We firmly believe that this proposition not only points out a path that conforms to the interests of the people of the world in the current international relations, but is also the most realistic for imperialist countries. However, he warned that if the imperialist aggressive bloc is unwilling to take this path and dares to invade socialist countries, then they will be met with the most resolute counterattack.

Zhou Enlai said that when visiting the seven nationalist countries in Asia, we felt like we were in the homes of close friends, relatives, and brothers. We do not shy away from the fact that our respective social and political systems are different, and that we have different views on many issues. However, these differences do not hinder our friendly cooperation.

He said that the people of these nationalist countries visited also demanded friendly cooperation with the people of other Asian countries. He believes that all outstanding issues between Asian and African countries should be resolved fairly and reasonably through peaceful consultation, and that no disputes should be allowed to hinder our unity.

Zhou Enlai pointed out that the Bandung Spirit has not withered away as its enemies had hoped, but is continuing to thrive and grow. We have decided to continue to strictly abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and strive to develop and strengthen friendly and cooperative relations with the countries we have visited and other Asian and African countries. Even for neighboring countries such as Thailand and the Philippines, Singapore and Malaya, which do not yet have normal relations with China today, we believe that there is no reason why we cannot improve our relations. I would also like to specifically point out that further promoting the normalization of relations between China and Japan should be put on the agenda. We are willing to strengthen equal and mutually beneficial economic and cultural cooperation with Asian and African countries as much as possible in accordance with the resolutions of the Bandung Conference, but this does not preclude these countries from conducting economic cooperation with any other country and accepting their assistance. During this visit, we personally saw that each country has its own outstanding advantages and strengths, and we are also willing to earnestly learn from the advantages and strengths of these countries.

Zhou Enlai told everyone that during this visit, Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz has accepted an invitation to visit China in April; Afghan Prime Minister Daoud and Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike have also been invited to visit our country.

Zhou Enlai particularly pointed out in his report that the Middle East is the focus of the current international situation. The development process of the tense situation in the Middle East fully demonstrates the intensification of contradictions between imperialist countries, especially the intensification of contradictions between the United States and Britain and France. What is currently threatening the countries of the Middle East is precisely the Eisenhower Doctrine of the United States. It centrally demonstrates the United States government's habitual trick of carrying out expansion and aggression, that is, using anti-communism and anti-Sovietism as an excuse, and creating a tense situation as a means to achieve the goals of suppressing national independence movements, squeezing out British and French colonial interests, and expanding its own colonial forces. This is the essence of American neo-colonialism.

Zhou Enlai said that when the international situation is tense to a certain degree, and when the pressure from all sides is constantly increasing, the United States government sometimes cannot but agree to some measures to ease the situation. However, the US aggressive bloc is afraid that the international situation will truly ease. Therefore, whenever the international situation truly eases, the US aggressive bloc is eager to create new tensions and try its best to obstruct further easing of the situation. This is the root cause of the US government's pursuit of tension without being too tense, being forced to ease the situation without daring to ease it for a long time, and therefore constantly oscillating between easing and tension. Zhou Enlai pointed out that this policy of the US government is unsustainable.

Zhou Enlai denounced the US government's policy of hostility towards the Chinese people. He said that since we called for striving for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, more and more Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan are willing to promote peaceful liberation, and the possibility of peaceful liberation of Taiwan is also increasing. Recently, the United States instigated a group of elements who flaunted the so-called free China and the so-called Taiwan independence elements to carry out activities to overthrow the Taiwan authorities, attempting to turn Taiwan into an American territory like Honolulu. In fact, this kind of US government's means can only make all patriotic Chinese people more clearly recognize the true face of the US government's attempt to enslave China. He called on all Chinese people with blood to unite in the spirit of patriotism and unite against foreign enemies to smash the conspiracy of US imperialism.

Zhou Enlai's report lasted two hours.

After Zhou Enlai's report, the committee members listened to the report on the work of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee made by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong and the appendix to the work report - the summary report of the Study Committee of the CPPCC National Committee on the work of short-term training courses for industrialists and businessmen.

More than 260 people, including chairmen, vice-chairmen, standing committee members and other people from various circles of the CPPCC provincial, autonomous region and municipal committees, attended this plenary session. The Guangxi delegation to Beijing to discuss issues related to the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region also attended the meeting.

Diplomatic envoys from various countries to China were also present at today's meeting.

Today's meeting ended at 5:40 p.m. Tomorrow, the meeting will conduct group discussions all day. (Attached picture)

    充分发挥人民民主统一战线的积极作用
    政协全国委员会第三次全体会议开幕
    周恩来作关于访问十一国的报告，指出：世界总的趋势是走向和缓、走向进步
    新华社5日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会主席、国务院总理周恩来今天说，“世界总的趋势是走向和缓、走向进步的。”
    中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第三次全体会议今天下午二时半在北京政协礼堂开幕。周恩来作了“关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告”。他报告了最近出国访问的结果，同时谈到了目前的国际形势和我国的外交政策。他说，和平的力量正在不断地壮大，战争的势力已经越来越加孤立。只要社会主义国家、民族主义国家和一切爱好和平的国家和人民团结起来，坚持斗争，世界的持久和平是可以争取得到的。
    中华人民共和国主席、中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会名誉主席毛泽东，和国家的其他领导工作人员，都参加了今天的会议。出席这次全体会议的委员，包括新增补的委员，共有六百二十一人。
    执行主席宋庆龄宣布会议开幕。她说，在大会的前几天，我们参加了最高国务会议的扩大会议，听了毛泽东主席的讲话。我们将在这次全体会议中，依照他的教导，就各项重要问题加以充分讨论，展开批评和自我批评，把我们的会议开好。她说，周恩来总理在将近三个月的时间，访问了十一个国家，历程十万余里，受到各国人民热烈的欢迎，对于加强社会主义阵营的团结和增进我国人民和亚洲各国人民之间的友谊，作出了卓越的贡献。我们欢呼这一伟大的成就，同时对他表示崇高的敬意。
    周恩来接着开始作他的长篇报告。他说，这次出国访问已经实现了寻求友谊、寻求和平和寻求知识的目的。
    周恩来说，对于四个社会主义国家的访问，使我们更加深信社会主义制度的优越性。社会主义各国的经济都日益高涨。社会主义各国的友好互助关系正在得到进一步的改进和加强。从过去整个时期来看，在社会主义国家，成绩总是基本的。随着经验的积累和实践的考验，社会主义国家将能够更好地调整人民内部的矛盾，使这种矛盾不致转化为对抗性的矛盾，使我们能够更好地克服工作中的困难，减少工作中的错误。
    他说，在这次访问中，我们又表达了对于进一步加强社会主义各国团结的深切愿望。这种愿望在访问过的每一个社会主义国家中都得到了共鸣。社会主义各国正在共同努力改进相互关系，加强团结。
    他说，我们社会主义国家根本不会向外扩张，根本不会对其他国家进行侵略。我们愿意同帝国主义国家互相保证互不侵犯，和平共处。我们深信，这种主张不仅在目前国际关系中指出了一条符合全世界人民利益的道路，而且对帝国主义国家来说，也是最现实的。但是，他警告，如果帝国主义侵略集团不愿意走这条道路，竟敢对社会主义国家进行侵犯，那么，他们将受到最坚决的回击。
    周恩来说，当在亚洲七个民族主义国家访问的时候，我们感到像在亲密的朋友、亲戚和兄弟的家里。我们并不讳言，我们各自的社会和政治制度是不同的，在许多问题上的观点也有不同。但是，这种不同并不妨碍我们之间的友好合作。
    他说，在访问过的这些民族主义国家的人民，也都要求同其他亚洲国家人民友好合作。他认为，亚非国家之间所有悬而未决的问题，都应该通过和平协商的途径，得到公平合理的解决，而不应该让任何争端妨碍我们的团结。
    周恩来指出，万隆精神决没有像它的敌人所希望的那样枯萎了，而是正在继续不断地繁荣滋长。我们决定继续在严格遵守五项原则的基础上，同我们这次访问过的国家和其他亚非国家，努力发展和加强友好合作关系。就是对于今天同中国还没有正常关系的邻国，例如泰国和菲律宾，新加坡和马来亚，我们认为也没有理由不能改善我们之间的关系。我还愿意特别指出，进一步促进中国和日本关系的正常化是应该提上议事日程了。我们愿意按照万隆会议的决议，尽可能地加强同亚非国家在经济上和文化上平等互利的合作。但并不排斥这些国家同任何别的国家进行经济合作和接受他们的援助。我们在这次访问中亲眼看到每一个国家都各有突出的优点和长处，我们也愿意认真学习这些国家的优点和长处。
    周恩来告诉大家，在这次访问期间，波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹已接受邀请，将在4月间来中国访问；阿富汗王国首相达乌德、锡兰总理班达拉奈克，也应邀将要来我国访问。
    周恩来在他的报告中特别指出，中近东是目前国际局势的焦点。中近东紧张局势的发展过程充分表现出帝国主义国家之间矛盾的尖锐化，特别是美国同英法的矛盾的尖锐化。目前威胁着中近东各国的正是美国的艾森豪威尔主义。它集中地表现了美国政府进行扩张和侵略的惯技，那就是，以反共、反苏为借口，以制造紧张局势为手段，来达到镇压民族独立运动、排挤英法殖民利益和扩大自己殖民势力的目的。这就是美国新殖民主义的实质。
    周恩来说，在国际局势紧张到了一定的程度，在来自各方面的压力不断加强的情况下，美国政府有时也不能不同意一些和缓局势的措施。但是，美国侵略集团是害怕国际局势真正有所和缓的。因此，每当国际局势真正有所和缓的时候，美国侵略集团就迫不及待地制造新的紧张，竭力阻挠局势的进一步和缓。这就是美国政府追求紧张而又不能过分紧张、被迫和缓而又不敢长期和缓，因而在和缓和紧张之间不断摇摆的根源。周恩来指出，美国政府这种政策是不能持久的。
    周恩来斥责了美国政府敌视中国人民的政策。他说，自从我们号召争取和平解放台湾以来，台湾国民党军政人员中愿意促进和平解放的人越来越多，和平解放台湾的可能性也越来越大了。最近美国策动一批标榜所谓自由中国的分子和所谓台湾独立的分子，进行推翻台湾当局的活动，企图把台湾变成檀香山一样的美国属地。其实，美国政府这种手段只能使一切爱国的中国人更加认清美国政府企图奴役中国的真面目。他号召一切有血性的中国人，都应该本着爱国一家的精神，团结起来，一致对外，粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋。
    周恩来的报告共历时两小时。
    在周恩来报告以后，委员们听取了陈叔通副主席作的政协全国委员会常务委员会工作报告和工作报告的附件——政协全国委员会学习委员会关于工商业者短期讲习班工作的总结报告。
    列席这次全体会议的有政协各省、自治区和市委员会主席、副主席，常务委员和其他方面人士二百六十多人。来京协商有关建立广西僮族自治区问题的广西代表团，也列席了会议。
    今天到会的还有各国驻华使节。
    今天的会议在下午五时四十分结束。明天整天，会议将进行分组讨论。（附图片）
