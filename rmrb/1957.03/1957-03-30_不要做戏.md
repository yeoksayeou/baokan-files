　　Don't Act
　　Peng Botong
　　Although drama is a reflection of real life, once it has undergone artistic processing, it is no longer exactly the same as real people and events. The stage is, after all, the stage, not an office, workshop, meeting room, dormitory, park, field, street, ship, or anything else; similarly, these places are not stages either. If every place is treated as a stage, everyone will inevitably need to wear makeup, memorize lines, lyrics, dialogues, and so on. This is exactly as Mr. Lu Xun said, the person playing Guan Yu still refuses to put down his Green Dragon Crescent Blade even after going backstage, and even carries it all the way home, resulting in Guan Yu and Lin Daiyu everywhere, singing back and forth, making people dizzy.
　　But even today, there are still a few people who seem to treat various living places as stages, spending a lot of time putting on airs, being insincere, walking the stage, and reciting lines. Their purpose is nothing more than to flaunt themselves in front of the people they come into contact with. With the general improvement of the people's political and ideological level, this kind of practice appears particularly glaring. Not only will it arouse the disgust of others, but it is not necessarily comfortable for oneself. There may not be much fun in this kind of pretentious life.
　　If life lacks a sense of life, one will not love life. People who do not love life will inevitably not do their work well. Revolutionary workers need to be honest and sincere!

　　不要做戏
　　彭伯通
    虽然戏剧是现实生活的反映，但是一经艺术加工，就与真人真事不尽相同。舞台究竟是舞台，不是办公室、车间、会议室、宿舍、公园、田野、街道、轮船或其他什么地方；同样，这些地方，也都不是舞台。倘若把处处地方当做舞台，势必每个人都需要化装，需要背台词、唱词、道白等等。这正像鲁迅先生所说的，扮演关云长的人，进了后台还不肯放下青龙偃月刀，乃至提着一路唱回家，结果到处都是关云长、林黛玉，唱来唱去，使人发昏。
    可是直到今天，仍然有少数人仿佛把各种生活场所当作舞台，花去了不少的时间装腔作势，言不由衷，走台步，背台词。其目的不外在所接触的人面前，炫耀自己。随着人民政治思想水平的普遍提高，这样的作法显得特别刺目。不但要引起别人的反感，即对自己来说，也不见得舒服。这样装腔作势的生活不见得有多少乐趣。
    日子过得缺乏生活气息，就不会热爱生活。不热爱生活的人，必然做不好工作。革命工作者需要老实，需要诚恳！
