Agricultural Proverbs
If you want to raise your cattle well, keep the trough full and give them grass with dew on it. In the fourth month of the lunar calendar, there are few idle people in the countryside, busy with transplanting rice seedlings and harvesting wheat. Plant sesame in the first ten days of the hot season, foxtail millet in the second ten days, and sorghum can still be planted in the third ten days. Plant beans around the Grain in Ear period, and rice flowers around the Summer Solstice; don't weed beans around Grain in Ear, and don't weed rice around Summer Solstice.

　　农谚若要耕牛养得好，栏干食饱露水草。乡村四月闲人少，栽禾割麦两头忙。头伏芝麻二伏粟，三伏还可种大粟。芒种豆打板，夏至禾出穗；芒种莫锄豆，夏至莫耘禾。
