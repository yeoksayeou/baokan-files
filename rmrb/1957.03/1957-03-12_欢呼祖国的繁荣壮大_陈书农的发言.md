    Cheering the Prosperity and Strength of the Motherland
    Chen Shunong's Speech
    A few days ago, I attended the Supreme State Conference as a nonvoting delegate and listened to Chairman Mao's speech. He gave clear instructions on how to resolve contradictions among the people, which were earnest and moving. I will take distinguishing right from wrong and recognizing the enemy as my guiding principles for doing things and conducting myself in the future. I completely agree with and wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's report on his visit to eleven Asian and European countries and Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of the Second Five-Year Plan. I am a former military and political personnel of the old era, having served as the Commander and Administrative Commissioner of the Kuomintang's Twelfth Pacification Zone. I feel deeply honored to be invited to participate in this solemn and grand meeting to jointly discuss national affairs.
    In July 1949, I went to Taiwan to recuperate. I saw American imperialism running rampant and committing all kinds of evils. Some people in the Kuomintang recognized the thief as their father and sought glory by selling out the country, which filled me with indignation. In February 1950, I moved from Taiwan to Hong Kong. At that time, I lacked understanding of socialist truth and the policies and programs of the People's Government. Coupled with the Kuomintang's reactionary propaganda, and the fact that I was a former high-ranking Kuomintang general, my heart was filled with doubts, so I hesitated for a long time. In the summer of 1955, I saw a sketch of Sichuan in a bookstore in Kowloon. There was a train on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, passing through Neijiang County heading west. This stirred my homesickness and I stared at it for a long time. It reminded me that the Kuomintang had ruled China for decades without building a single mile of railway in Sichuan. Why was the Chinese Communist Party able to build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway shortly after coming to power? I thought it was the greatest miracle at the time. Since then, I have been reading progressive newspapers and magazines. I have seen that under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of our country have undergone fundamental changes in all aspects, including politics, economy, culture, education, and national defense, in just a few years, and everything symbolizes the prosperity and strength of our country. These have moved me the most. All doubts disappeared. I responded to the government's call and resolutely returned to the country. I am very excited about the Party and the government's tolerance and care for me.
    After returning to China, I saw that social order was well-maintained, everyone was immersed in building the country, people's lives were generally improved, and people were loving and caring for each other. Soon, I participated in studies at the Shanghai Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference and visited industrial construction in cities such as Lanzhou, Xi'an, Luoyang, and Zhengzhou in the Northwest. The wider my exposure, the more I felt that the face of the motherland had changed dramatically. After visiting the construction in the Northwest, I realized that everyone at work understood that they were building a paradise for themselves, so they could work tirelessly day and night, which greatly increased my confidence in socialist construction. From these experiences, I realized the greatness of the Party and Chairman Mao, and I realized that the future of our country is infinitely bright. I must strengthen my studies and, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, better serve the people, and advise Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan and overseas to quickly respond to the government's call, in the spirit of harmony is precious and loving the country as one family, to work together to strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and fight against American imperialist aggression. Finally, please allow me to express my heartfelt voice:
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live Chairman Mao! (with picture)

    欢呼祖国的繁荣壮大
    陈书农的发言
    前几天我列席了最高国务会议，听了毛主席的讲话，对人民内部矛盾，明确指示了解决方法，语重心长，使人感动。当以明辨是非、认清敌我，作为我今后作事作人的指路碑。对周总理访问亚欧十一国的报告及李富春副总理第二个五年计划说明，我完全同意，衷心拥护。我是个旧时代军政人员，曾经作过国民党十二绥靖区司令官兼行政长官，能够应邀参加这个庄严隆重的会议，共同讨论国家大事，深感荣幸。
    我1949年7月赴台湾养病，看到美帝国主义横行霸道，无恶不作。国民党某些人，认贼作父，卖国求荣，因此气愤填膺。于1950年2月由台湾移住香港，当时对社会主义真理及人民政府政纲政策，均欠了解，再加国民党反动宣传，我曾是个国民党高级将领，使我内心增加疑虑，因此长期徘徊。1955年夏天，我在九龙一个书店里，看到一张四川写生图，成渝铁道上有列火车，正经过内江县往西开，当时触动乡思，凝视很久，使我追想到国民党统治中国几十年，未在四川修一里铁路，中国共产党在取得政权不久，为什么能够把成渝铁路修通，我当时认为这是个最大的奇迹。从此阅读进步书报，见到祖国人民，在党和毛主席英明领导下，仅仅数年时间，无论在政治、经济、文化教育、建设国防各方面，都一日千里，起了根本变化，一切都象征着我们国家的繁荣壮大，这些使我受到最大感动。疑虑全消，响应政府号召，毅然回国，蒙党与政府宽大和照顾，使我非常兴奋。
    回国后看到社会秩序井然，人人埋头建国，人民生活普遍提高，彼此接触相亲相爱。不久即参加上海市政协学习，并往西北参观兰州、西安、洛阳、郑州各城市工业建设，接触面越广，越感到祖国面貌大大改变。参观西北建设后，知道工作中的每一个人，都了解是为自己建筑乐园，故能夜以继日的劳作不懈，对于社会主义建设，加倍发生了信心。从这些体会到党和毛主席的伟大，并认识到我们国家远景，无限光明。我一定要加强学习，在党和毛主席领导下，更好的为人民服务，并劝告台湾及海外的国民党军政人员，赶快响应政府号召，本着和为贵、和爱国一家的精神，共同努力争取和平解放台湾，反对美帝侵略而斗争。最后请允许我发出内心的呼声：
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！（附图片）
