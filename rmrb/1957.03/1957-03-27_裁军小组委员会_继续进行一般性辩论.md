Xinhua News Agency, London, March 26th: The United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee continued its closed-door meeting on March 25th, chaired by the Soviet representative, Zorin.

　　The meeting continued the general debate on disarmament issues. Sources say that the Western representatives did not change their original stance on disarmament issues at the meeting, which has meant that the work of the subcommittee, which has been going on for a week, has not made much progress so far.

    裁军小组委员会
　  继续进行一般性辩论
    新华社26日讯　伦敦消息：联合国裁军委员会小组委员会3月25日继续举行秘密会议，担任主席的是苏联代表佐林。
    这一天会议继续对裁军问题进行一般性的辩论。有消息说，西方代表在会上并没有改变他们对裁军问题原来采取的立场，因而使得已经举行了一个星期的小组委员会的工作迄今还没有什么进展。
