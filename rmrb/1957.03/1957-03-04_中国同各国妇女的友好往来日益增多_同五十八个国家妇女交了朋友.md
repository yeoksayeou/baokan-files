Xinhua News Agency dispatch: In the past few years, Chinese women have made friends with women from 58 countries. In 1956 in particular, friendly exchanges between Chinese and foreign women increased as never before. In that year, Chinese women received 214 women friends from 50 countries who came to China as guests, and Chinese women also accepted invitations to send 42 women representatives to 11 countries to visit or attend international conferences.

In the past year, 184 leaders of international and national women's organizations, headed by Madame Eugénie Cotton, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation and renowned peace activist, as well as prominent social activists, came to China to attend the WIDF Council meeting held in Beijing. They came from 47 countries in Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Americas, and Africa.

When visiting various places in our country, our women friends not only praised the achievements of our socialist transformation, socialist construction, and women's work, but also frankly criticized and suggested improvements regarding shortcomings in our work.
