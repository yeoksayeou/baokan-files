Some people harbor a sense of class decline, are emotionally negative, and are timid and hesitant in everything they do, lacking initiative and enthusiasm in their work;

Some people believe that since they are national assets, they should regard themselves as "rare commodities" and not actively contribute their strength.

I was deeply moved this time to hear Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people. The Chinese Communist Party thinks of the people in everything and first examines itself before blaming others. It leads the country with such noble character and great spirit, and prosperity and strength can be assured. I fully agree with and support Vice Premier Li's explanation of the Second Five-Year Plan, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the Standing Committee, and Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech. I also heard Chairman Zhou Enlai's report on his visit to eleven Asian and European countries, which further strengthened my understanding that the forces of the world's peace, democracy, and socialist camp are becoming increasingly powerful, and the declining state of the imperialist camp is becoming increasingly obvious. However, they will inevitably make a dying struggle. Therefore, it is essential to strengthen the unity of the countries in the peace, democracy, and socialist camp and the unity among the people. With the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our people across the country are studying hard, working actively, and striving to build our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country. Now, I would like to talk about my personal experience on the issue of ideological remolding of industrialists and businessmen. If there is anything wrong, please give me your criticism and suggestions.

Over the past eight years, under the cultivation and education of the Party and the government, and with the help and supervision of the working masses in enterprises and people from all walks of life, most of us industrialists and businessmen have gradually improved our ideological understanding through our own efforts and mutual assistance. We have recognized and practiced the principles of accepting socialist transformation. I examine myself as someone who has made only slight progress, but today my ideological understanding and actions are different from what they were eight years ago. Why is it necessary to destroy capitalism and establish socialism? Why do industrialists and businessmen have a bright future only by taking the socialist road? I have a clearer understanding of these questions. Many industrialists and businessmen have studied harder and practiced more diligently than I have, and therefore, they have made greater progress than I have. Before the full-industry public-private partnership, capitalist industry and commerce played a positive role in the national economy and people's livelihood under the leadership of the state's economy. When the high tide of the socialist revolution arrived, capitalist industrialists and businessmen joyfully welcomed the full-industry public-private partnership. After the full-industry public-private partnership, private personnel enthusiastically engaged in studying political theory, actively worked to improve public-private cooperation, and participated in socialist competitions to further their self-education and self-transformation. All of these are concrete manifestations of industrialists and businessmen's desire to make progress. How to consolidate and improve on the existing foundation in the future requires our continued efforts.

According to my personal observation and feelings, the Party and the government care about the lives and work of us industrialists and businessmen and constantly cultivate and educate us so that we can achieve socialist transformation through peaceful means. However, we are bourgeois elements, and individualism remains a major element in our ideology. Therefore, when there is a contradiction between the collective and long-term interests and our individual and temporary interests, and when individual and temporary interests need to be subordinate to collective and long-term interests, we feel indecisive and at a loss. The correct and positive side of our thinking will engage in fierce struggle with the incorrect and negative side. How to stabilize in an unsteady state, persist in moving towards the goal of socialism in a roundabout course, and win in ideological struggle requires overcoming individualism. The process of self-education and self-transformation for industrialists and businessmen cannot be smooth sailing; it is a long-term and continuous process of overcoming individualism.

The Party and the government recognize that we industrialists and businessmen are also national assets. After the merger of enterprises, the state arranges work for us in the merged enterprises or state organs, giving us positions and powers, maintaining our original salaries and remuneration, and allowing us to receive fixed interest for a certain number of years. Everything starts from encouragement and unity, in order to be conducive to the country's production and construction, and conducive to leading us to accept transformation. The key is that we must actively contribute our talents and skills in managing enterprises in order to become national assets worthy of the name. However, many of us are content with the status quo, saying that we can slowly transform ourselves over the seven years of fixed interest, and we no longer have the enthusiasm and concern for the enterprise that we had during the private period. Furthermore, some people reflect that the seven years of fixed interest are too short and the positions arranged are too low, as if there is still not enough of such meticulous care. In addition, industrialists and businessmen realize that the bourgeoisie is to be eliminated, which is originally conducive to transformation; however, some people harbor a sense of class decline, are emotionally negative, some are timid and hesitant, and lack initiative and enthusiasm in their work. On the other hand, they often consider themselves infallible, regard themselves as national assets, and harbor the capitalist idea of "rare commodities" in terms of contributing their talents, only moving when pushed. Some also look down on public representatives, or only have public representatives in their eyes, look down on the working masses, are not willing to consult with the working masses in case of trouble, and even less willing to learn from the working masses. Some "think they have been transformed almost enough," forming a separation from the masses and fostering complacency. The intertwining of such class inferiority and arrogance is extremely detrimental to our transformation. Individually, they will commit illegal and undisciplined acts.

Selfishness, inferiority, and arrogance are ideological consciousnesses that stem from bourgeois individualism. In the process of self-education and self-transformation, we industrialists and businessmen must strengthen theoretical study to overcome individualistic thinking and put in painful efforts in "seeking the cause in oneself." "Learning then knows inadequacy," "complacency is the enemy of learning," "modesty makes progress, and arrogance makes one fall behind." We must firmly remember what Chairman Mao taught us, unite what we think in our hearts, what we say with our mouths, and what we do in practice, master the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, strictly examine ourselves, and faithfully help others. By doing so, I believe that we will surely achieve victory in the process of self-education and self-transformation, make our people more united, accelerate the socialist construction of the motherland, and thereby enable our great motherland to make greater contributions to the cause of world peace.

    工商业者要不断进行思想改造
    胡厥文的发言
    有一些人怀有阶级没落感，情绪消极，遇事畏首畏尾，工作不积极主动；
    有一些人认为既是国家财富，便以“奇货”自居，不积极贡献自己的力量。
    我这次听到了毛主席就正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题的讲话，中国共产党事事为人民着想，事事先反求诸己，然后加责于人，以这一种高贵的品德、伟大的精神来领导一个国家，富强繁荣可以操券，使我非常感动。听到了李副总理第二个五年计划的说明、陈叔通副主席的常务委员会工作报告，陈云副总理的发言，我完全同意和拥护。又听到了周恩来主席关于访问亚欧十一国的报告，使我进一步认识到世界和平民主和社会主义阵营的力量越来越强大，帝国主义阵营没落的景象越来越显著。但是它们必定还要作垂死的挣扎，因此，加强和平民主和社会主义阵营国家的团结、人民内部的团结是十分必要的。我们全国人民有了中国共产党的正确领导，信心百倍地努力学习，积极工作，正在为把我们的国家从一个落后的农业国建设成为一个先进的工业国而努力。现在我就工商业者思想改造问题，谈谈我个人的体会，不对的地方，请委员同志们和工商业者同志们给以批评、指教。
    我们工商业者八年来在党和政府的培养教育下，在企业职工群众和社会各阶层人士的帮助、监督下，通过自我努力和相互协助，大多数人思想认识逐步有所提高，认识并实践着接受社会主义改造的道理。我检查自己是一个进步微小的人，但是，今天我的思想认识和行动表现，与八年前比较起来，也是有所不同的。为什么要破资本主义、立社会主义？为什么工商业者要走社会主义的道路才有光明的前途？在思想上都有了比较明确的认识。好多工商业者同志们学习比我努力得多，实践比我认真得多，因而进步也比我大得多。全行业公私合营以前，资本主义工商业在国家经济领导下，起着有利于国计民生的积极作用；在社会主义革命高潮到来的时候，资本主义工商业者欢欣鼓舞地迎接全行业公私合营；全行业公私合营以后，私方人员热烈地投入学习政治理论，积极地搞好公私合作共事关系和参加社会主义竞赛，进一步地进行自我教育、自我改造。所有这些，都是工商业者要求进步的具体表现。今后如何在原有的基础上巩固和提高，需要我们继续努力。
    根据我个人的体察和观感，党和政府关心我们工商业者的生活和工作，并不断地培养、教育我们，使我们能够通过和平的道路得到社会主义改造。但是，我们是资产阶级分子，个人主义在我们的思想意识上依然是一个主要的东西。因此，当集体的、长远的利益与我们个人的、暂时的利益存在着矛盾，需要个人的、暂时的利益服从集体的、长远的利益的时候，我们会感觉摇摆不定，进退失据，思想上正确的、积极的一面会与不正确的、消极的一面展开激烈的斗争。怎样在摇摆不定的状态下稳定起来，从迂回曲折的途程中坚持向着社会主义的目标前进，在思想斗争中取得胜利，必须克服个人主义。工商业者进行自我教育、自我改造的过程不可能是一帆风顺的，是一个长期性的不断的克服个人主义的过程。
    党和政府认定我们工商业者也是国家的财富，企业合营后，国家给我们在合营企业或者国家机关里安排工作，有职有权，维持原有的薪给报酬，并在一定年限内使我们有定息可拿，一切都从鼓励和团结出发，为的是有利于国家的生产建设，有利于领导我们接受改造，而关键在于我们必须积极地贡献出我们经营企业的才能和技术，方才能够成为名副其实的国家财富。可是我们当中还有不少人安于现状，说定息七年可以慢慢改造，自己在私营时期对于企业那股热情和关心的劲头就没有了。再还有些人反映定息七年太短，安排的职位太低，似乎对这样无微不至的照顾还有所不足。此外，工商业者认识到资产阶级是要被消灭的，这样的自觉，原是于改造有利的；但是，有些人怀有阶级没落感，情绪消极，有的缩手缩脚，遇事畏首畏尾，工作上缺乏主动性和积极性。另一方面，又常常自以为是，以国家的财富自居，在贡献才能方面，存着“奇货可居”、推一推动一动的资本主义思想。还有看不起公方代表，或者眼睛里只有公方代表，看不起职工群众，遇事不乐于与职工群众商量，更谈不到向职工群众学习。有的“自以为改造得差不多了”，形成脱离群众，滋长着骄傲自满情绪。似这样阶级自卑感与自高自大的情绪相互交织着，发展下去，对我们的改造极为不利，个别的将会做出违法乱纪的勾当来。
    自私、自卑和自大是从资产阶级个人主义出发的思想意识。我们工商业者要在自我教育、自我改造的过程中，克服个人主义思想，必须加强理论学习，在“反求诸己”上痛切地下工夫。“学然后知不足”， “自满是学习的敌人”，“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”，紧紧记住毛主席教导我们的话，把心里所想的、嘴里所说的与实际所做的统一起来，掌握批评与自我批评的武器，严格地检查自己，忠实地帮助别人。这样做，我相信我们一定能够在自我教育、自我改造的过程中取得胜利，使我们人民内部团结得更好，祖国社会主义建设进行得更快，从而使我们伟大的祖国为世界和平事业作出更大的贡献。
