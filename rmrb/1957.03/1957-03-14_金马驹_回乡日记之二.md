    Golden Colt
    —Diary of Returning Home, Part Two
    Lü Jianzhong
    The train arrived at Laiyang Station. It was already late at night. Outside, it was snowing heavily.
    On the train, I heard passengers say that since the Lan (cun) Yan (tai) railway was built, Laiyang City had become prosperous, and Laiyang was now a major station! I didn't expect that after getting off the train, it would still be more than ten li to the city.
    Everything around was pitch black. The northwest wind carried semi-melted snowflakes, hitting us in the face. It was cold, the ground was slippery, we were unfamiliar with the place, and would we be able to find a hotel in the city so late at night?…
    Just as my companion and I were puzzled, a kind voice came from behind:
    "Comrades, are you going to the city? My cart can squeeze two people in. It's cold!" In the dim light, a young man's face was wrapped in an ear-flapped cotton hat, his eyes shining brightly.
    "Oh, that's great! Can you pull two people? In this heavy snow!" We said with gratitude, and followed him to the few tricycles covered in a layer of snow.
    This young man was very attentive. After we got into the cart, he put a blanket we had brought with us over our legs, constantly urging: "Tuck it in, tuck it in, it's cold!" As if he hadn't thought about whether he himself was cold at all.
    The cart left the few small earthen houses near the station, and the wind and snow became even heavier. My companion, with a somewhat complaining tone, asked why the station was so far from the city? It's so inconvenient! The young tricycle worker immediately explained: "To meet the needs of development!" He said this very skillfully, as if he had said it countless times. So I continued to ask: "I heard that once the Lanyan Railway was opened, your Laiyang City became prosperous, is that right?"
    "That goes without saying. Our Laiyang is a treasure land, producing everything, but transportation was inconvenient. Now that the Lanyan Road is built, go to the city and take a look. This company, that purchasing station, hey! All new buildings."
    The wind and snow were getting heavier and heavier, and the snowflakes were mixed with small snowballs, hitting our faces like sand. The blanket was also covered with a layer of semi-solidified snow, weighing heavily on our legs. Although we could see a white light in the sky above Laiyang City in the distance, after walking for a while and looking up, it still seemed so far away. The tricycle worker hunched over, leaning and twisting, pedaling hard, the cart squeaking non-stop. I couldn't sit still on the cart and asked to stop and walk on the ground to reduce the weight of the cart. But this young man refused. He jumped out of the cart, adjusted the cart cover, as if to dispel our inner unease, and said: "Don't worry, comrades, we're almost there. You must be tired along the way. I'll help you find a good hotel in the city to rest in, so you can take the bus tomorrow." He wiped his sweat and asked as he got back on the cart: "Comrades, are you a little hungry? With this train, you can eat whatever you want. Tomorrow you can even eat fresh prawns in the restaurant. Well, judging from your accent, you seem to be from the eastern part, have you been to Laiyang before?"
    He was struggling. Although his tone of questioning seemed so relaxed and gentle, we really didn't want him to talk too much, so we simply answered: "Never been here," and said no more.
    Actually, although I had never been to Laiyang before, I had some understanding of the people of Laiyang, and I could also understand why this young man particularly emphasized that fresh prawns could now be eaten in Laiyang. Childhood memories clearly emerged in my mind. The doorway of my hometown in Haiyang was a main road leading to a fishing port on the Yellow Sea coast. Every spring fishing season, this road became busy. At night, sleeping in bed, the sound of mule hooves, the clanging of bells, mixed with the sound of yelling at livestock, often woke me from my dreams. The old people said that it was the farmers of Laiyang bringing local products to the sea to exchange for fish and shrimp. They traveled for days and nights in those overlapping mountains, and often the fish and shrimp would rot before they even got home. The old people also told us a story about the Laiyang people's longing for a new life with a tone of sympathy: an old man, who had never eaten fresh seafood in his life. He spent all year round chopping firewood in the mountains, and he would help any passerby who had no means of support, even if it meant going without food himself. The old man's diligence and kindness moved the divine spirits above. One day, as he was chopping firewood, he heard the mountain roar and split open, revealing a pair of golden colts. The golden colts asked the old man what he wanted. The old man thought for a moment and said: I don't want firewood or rice, I don't want clothes, I just want you, golden colts, to run to the East Sea. The golden colts understood the old man's meaning, and they carried firewood and rice to the sea every day to exchange for fresh fish and salt. This story also aroused my sympathy for the people of Laiyang. I even sometimes heard the bells ringing at night, and I would get up and run to the street with the neighborhood children out of curiosity. Under the moonlight, we could see strings of mules carrying heavy loads, their heads lowered, moving forward with difficulty, and the people in their half-length cotton jackets and cloth shoes were also sweating profusely, exhausted. At that time, I naively thought: if these people of Laiyang really had a golden colt, how wonderful it would be!
    Now, the "golden colt" that the people of Laiyang have dreamed of for generations has truly appeared. Every day, when those trains spewing thick smoke, carrying the things they need, speed past their eyes, how happy they are! They no longer think about any golden colt. Thinking of this, I can easily understand why the young man in front of me is so optimistic and why his eyes are so bright.
    Memories and contemplation made me forget the cold. Suddenly, the train roared, shaking the cold night sky, and the wind also roared, as if showing off, pulling at the cart cover. I regained my composure and saw that the young man's head was steaming. I couldn't bear it any longer. Without waiting for him to stop, I stretched my frozen legs and jumped out of the cart to help him push it.
    When we arrived in the city, it was already past midnight, and the snow was still falling. This young man went from door to door to find a hotel for us. He also told us that his wife had originally advised him to rest one more night today so that he could go to the street to buy some things for the Spring Festival. However, the wind and snow outside were getting heavier and heavier, and he thought that there would be very few tricycles going to the station in the city tonight, so what would happen to the passengers getting off the train? This heavy wind and snow! After thinking about it, he finally got out of his warm bed and rode his tricycle to the station. We felt sorry for him and thanked him repeatedly; but he was always afraid that we would feel uneasy, and he didn't even want to show how tired he was in front of us. This young man's heart is so beautiful. I feel that the person standing in front of me is not just a tricycle worker. He works hard, not just for money, for his own needs, but he is even more aware that his work is for others, for the needs of others. In the past, we often said: "The motherland is lovable," "The people of the motherland are advancing," but never before has this made me feel the truth of these words so keenly.

    ——回乡日记之二
    吕建中
    列车到达莱阳车站，夜已深了。外面下着大雪。
    在列车上就听旅客们说，自从修了蓝（村）烟（台）铁路，莱阳城繁华起来了，莱阳还是个大站口呢！我却没想到，下车以后到城里还有十多里路。
    四外一片漆黑，西北风挟着半融化的雪花迎面扑来，天冷，地滑，人地两生，深更半夜到了城里能不能找到旅馆？……
    我和我的同伴正困惑着，背后传来一种亲切的声音：
    “同志，要进城吧？我这车可以挤着坐两个人，天冷啊！”在微弱的灯光下，一张年轻人的脸裹在带耳朵的棉帽里，眼睛闪闪有神。
    “唔，好极了！您拉得动两个人吗？这大的风雪！”我们以感激的心情说，随他走近那边很少几辆蒙着一层雪的三轮车。
    这年轻人十分殷勤。我们上了车，他把我们随身带的一条毛毯给我们蒙到腿上，口里不住叮咛着： “压好，压好，冷啊！”好像他全然没有想到自己冷不冷。
    车子走出车站附近的几座小土房，风雪就更大了。我的同伴多少带着些埋怨的口气问，车站为什么要离城这么远？多不方便哪！那年轻的三轮车工人立刻解释说：“适应发展需要嘛！”这句话他说得很熟练，像是说过不知多少次了。于是我又接着问：“听说蓝烟铁路一通车，您们莱阳城繁华起来了，是吗？”
    “那还用说，我们莱阳是块宝地呀，什么都出产，就是交通不便。修了蓝烟路，您到城里看看吧，这公司，那采购站，咳！全是新楼房。”
    风雪越来越紧，雪花里还夹杂着些小雪球，像沙子一样向我们脸上直摔，毯子上也早就盖着一层半凝固的雪，沉甸甸地压在腿上。虽然远远望见莱阳城上空泛着一道白光，但走一会抬眼望望，好像还是那么远。三轮车工人弓着身子，一歪，一扭，吃力地蹬着，车子不住吱呀吱呀响。我在车子上坐不住了，要求停下来下地步行，好减少些车子的重量。可是这年轻人不肯，他跳下车来整一整车篷，像是为了要解除我们内心的不安似地说：“别着急，同志，快到了，您们一路上挺累，到城里帮您找个好旅馆，歇息歇息，明天好上汽车。”他揩揩汗，一边跨上车，一边又问：“同志，有点饿了吧？这一通火车，您想吃什么都有，明天您到饭馆里还能吃上鲜对虾呢。唔，听您的口韵像是东半拉人，以前到过我们莱阳吗？”
    他很吃力。虽然他问话的语气显得那么轻松、温和，可是我们实在不想让他多说话，便只简单回答一句：“没来过”，再不说下去了。
    其实，我过去虽然没有到过莱阳，对莱阳人却是有些了解的，而且也能理解这年轻人为什么特别强调现在在莱阳能吃上鲜对虾。儿时的记忆清楚地浮现在我脑子里。我海阳故乡的家门口就是一条通往黄海海滨一个渔港的大路，每年春季鱼汛，这条大路上就繁忙起来了。夜里睡在床上，骡蹄声，叮叮当当的铃铛声，夹杂着吆喝牲口的声音，常常把我从梦中惊醒。老人们说那是莱阳农民带着土产到海上换鱼虾的，他们几天几夜在那重重叠叠的山岭之间盘行，常常不等走到家鱼虾就发臭了。老人们也以同情的口吻给我们讲过一个关于莱阳人渴望新生活的故事：一个老汉，一辈子没吃过海里的鲜鱼。他终年累月在山上打柴，过往行人凡是生活没有着落的，他宁肯自己不吃饭也解囊相助。老汉的勤劳、好心肠感动了上方神灵。这天，他正打柴，只听那山呼拉一声响，裂出一对金马驹来，那金马驹问老汉要求些什么，老汉想了想，说：一不要柴米，二不要衣衫，单要您金马驹跑到东海边。金马驹懂得了老汉的意思，便天天驮着柴米到海上去换回鲜鱼和食盐。这故事也引起了我对莱阳人的同情。我甚至有时夜里听到铃铛响，便爬起来和邻家孩子好奇地跑到街头上去看。月光底下，只见一串一串驮着重载的骡子，低着头，吃力地挪着步，那些穿半截棉袄、双鼻梁鞋的人也走得满头大汗，疲惫不堪。当时我幼稚地想：这些莱阳人要是真有个金马驹该多好哇！
    现在，莱阳人世世辈辈幻想的“金马驹”真地出现了。每天当那一列一列吐着浓烟的火车，载着他们所需要的东西在眼前风驰而过的时候，他们是多么高兴啊！他们再也不想什么金马驹了。想到这一点，我也就很容易理解我眼前这个年轻人为什么那么乐观，眼睛为什么那么有神。
    回忆和沉思使我忘记了寒冷。突然，火车一声吼叫，震荡着寒冷的夜空，风也逞强似地掣着车篷嘶叫。我定神一看，那年轻人的头上直冒热气。我再也忍不住了，不等他停车，就伸一伸冻僵了的腿跳下车来，帮他推推车子。
    到了城里，已经过半夜了，雪还是不停地下着。这年轻人又挨门逐户给我们找旅馆。并且告诉我们说，本来他妻子劝他今天多歇一晚，第二天好上街买点东西过春节。可是外面风雪越来越大，他想，今晚城里的三轮车去车站的很少，那下车的旅客怎么办呢？这大的风雪！想来想去，最后他还是从暖和的被窝里爬起来，蹬着三轮车奔向车站去了。我们觉得过意不去，一再地感谢他；可是他也总是怕我们心里不安，甚至不愿在我们面前现露出自己很疲劳。这年轻人的心灵真是太美好了。我觉得我面前站着的不单是一个三轮车工人，他劳动，决不单单是为了钱、为了自己的需要，他更意识到自己的劳动是为了别人，为了别人的需要。过去常说：“祖国可爱”、“祖国人民在前进”，可是再没有比这种时候使我感到这话的真切了。
