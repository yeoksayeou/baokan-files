Zhang Dongye Says:
I Saw Some New Things in Qianshan

In the meeting, I listened to the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li, and Vice Chairman Chen, which gave me infinite encouragement and education. In particular, I met the wise, great, kind, and loving Chairman Mao, and listened to his instructions. Chairman Mao's instructions were as intimate as those from family members, which truly moved and warmed me infinitely. We should carefully study all the issues that Chairman Mao instructed and use them as guidelines in our work.

Fellow committee members, fellow comrades, in the winter of 1955, when the nationwide upsurge of agricultural cooperation arrived, everyone enthusiastically said how superior cooperation was. However, between the autumn and winter of 1956, some people had different views on agricultural cooperation. Because of these rumors, I, a person with an old mindset, became confused. After the Spring Festival this year, Anhui organized provincial people's representatives and provincial CPPCC members to conduct inspections separately. I also inspected the Huailian Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Hefei, and also saw the Luohan Township Central Advanced Cooperative in my hometown of Qianshan County. This cooperative is a "thousand-jin" cooperative. After seeing these cooperatives, I felt that those different views and statements were mostly made without a comprehensive view of the problem, relying on hearsay and subjective imagination combined with one's own old consciousness. Chairman Mao said: "No investigation, no right to speak." Only now did I truly understand this. Now I will first talk about the Huailian Cooperative in the suburbs of Hefei. The Huailian Cooperative was established as an advanced cooperative in the spring of 1956 during the upsurge. It has 664 farm households, 3,020 members, and 7,500 mu of cultivated land (the cooperative originally had more than 8,000 mu of land, which was reduced to 7,500 mu due to the construction of a reservoir, excluding more than 200 mu of gardens, actually 7,200 mu), 244 head of cattle, and 453 large agricultural implements. Its total grain output in 1956 was 3,120,135 jin, and the total output in 1955 was 2,591,484 jin. The 1956 output was more than 520,000 jin higher than that of 1955. The average yield per mu in 1955 was more than 313 jin, and the average yield per mu in 1956 was more than 433 jin. This shows that after the establishment of the advanced cooperative in 1956, the average yield per mu increased by more than 120 jin compared with 1955. In 1956, the total output value of agricultural and sideline industries was 338,685 yuan, of which 244,737 yuan was distributed to the members, accounting for 72% of the total income. Each labor day was worth 9 jiao, and the average income per household was 368.5 yuan, with an average income of about 81 yuan per person. The most prominent household, Ruan Zhenqing's family of 14, had seven laborers and an annual income of 1,715 yuan.

Since the Huailian Cooperative implemented the "three reforms" method after cooperation, the income of the members has indeed greatly increased as mentioned above. I think that if each person in the countryside can earn an average of 81 yuan per year, the living standard would not be bad under the current conditions, and a household like Ruan Zhenqing's, with many laborers, actually earned 1,715 yuan. What could be unpleasant about this kind of life? In short, we don't need to doubt the superiority of agricultural cooperation at all. However, shortcomings are inevitable in the process of advancement. In the Huailian Cooperative, because they planted watermelons, the cooperative cadres did not master the principle of adapting to local conditions. In the 1956 production, they planted watermelons on 30 mu of yellow soil dry land. Experienced members and some cooperative cadres said that watermelons could not be grown on yellow soil, only Victory No. 100 sweet potatoes could be grown. They did not listen. As a result, only a few small, bowl-sized watermelons grew. Everyone laughed and picked them off to eat on the field. The cadre knew he was wrong, so he held a general meeting to make a self-criticism and learned from this lesson. This year, they decided to plant Victory No. 100 sweet potatoes.

Fellow committee members, fellow comrades, if we only talk about the failure of planting 30 mu of watermelons without mentioning the overall achievements of the Huailian Cooperative, we would completely obliterate all the benefits of the Huailian Cooperative, relying on hearsay, and even overturn the superiority of agricultural cooperation. Would this be reasonable? I don't think we would look at the problem this way. Now I want to talk about the high-spirited life of the people in agricultural cooperation in my hometown of Qianshan County. I saw some new things in Qianshan that I never dreamed of. Qianshan is a mountainous county and was very poor in the past. It only fully realized advanced agricultural cooperation in 1956. In 1956, the farmers' enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high, and they fully utilized the favorable conditions of cooperation to actively promote the three agricultural reforms. The multiple cropping index of cultivated land reached 234%, and 137,000 mu of double-cropping rice were planted, which was 20 times that of 1955. The total grain output in 1956 was 236.54 million jin, which was more than 51.51 million jin higher than the highest historical output in 1955, an increase of 27.8%. Three "thousand-jin" cooperatives appeared in the county, including the Luohan Township Central Cooperative, with an average annual output of 1,039 jin and 14 liang per mu. This Luohan Township Central Cooperative was an advanced cooperative formed in the winter of 1955 by merging two small cooperatives and five mutual aid teams. The whole cooperative has 138 households, 593 people, 170 full and half laborers, 809.45 mu of paddy fields, and 20 mu of dry land. The land of this cooperative is considered the worst among the 14 cooperatives in Luohan Township. Due to the establishment of the advanced cooperative and collective management, the superiority of cooperation was brought into full play, especially in increasing grain production. The 1956 production achievements of this cooperative reached the requirements of the three increases in land, pigs, and cattle proposed by Anhui Province. Based on the 728.85 mu of grain cultivated land alone, a total of 731,688 jin of grain were harvested, with an average yield of 1,039.14 jin per mu, an increase of 58% compared with the total grain output in 1955. Therefore, they became a "thousand-jin" cooperative. But rapeseed and peanuts were not included. In sideline production, pig raising also made great progress. The number of pigs increased by 233% compared with 1955. In addition to over fulfilling the state's task of purchasing fat pigs by 25 heads, the cooperative also slaughtered 22 fat pigs publicly. Many were slaughtered privately. Now the whole cooperative raises 156 pigs and 79 piglets. There were 34 head of cattle in 1955, and in 1956, the number increased to 42, an increase of 8 head compared with 1955.

In this central cooperative, there is a Wanjia Flower House, 15 li away from the county seat. The 17 households in this house were extremely poor before liberation. There were 18 and a half begging sticks in that village. Among them, there was a man named Wan Fenglou, who is now over 40 years old. He came from a poor peasant family and has five family members. In the past, he cultivated a few mu of land belonging to the Gui family's ancestral hall. After paying rent and having the landlord eat and drink extravagantly, there was no surplus grain left at home. The family relied on begging every year. His family had two and a half begging sticks (one for his wife, half for his daughter-in-law, and one for himself). His son helped people watch cattle, barely making ends meet. The family suffered from hunger and cold. After liberation, he was allocated land and houses for his five family members. From mutual aid teams to elementary cooperatives, his difficulties were gradually solved. In 1955, his two and a half sticks were all discarded, but he still had minor difficulties in life. In 1956, he experienced a major turnaround. Wan Fenglou's son, Wan Yinnan, fed cattle in the cooperative and was awarded the title of labor model twice. His daughter-in-law, Nie Manlan, was also awarded the title of labor model twice. Therefore, everyone said: Wan Yinnan and Nie Manlan, the husband and wife, both wear flowers. Wan Fenglou's family worked more than 400 labor days. Including the fixed grain quota and more pay for more work, each person received 720 jin of grain, and the five family members received a total of 3,600 jin of grain. In addition, they received more than 260 yuan. They slaughtered a fat pig in September and another fat pig during the New Year, selling both fat pigs for more than 100 yuan. Therefore, they made two sets of new cotton-padded clothes and trousers made of straight tribute cloth, a 12-jin heavy quilt (Qianshan custom quilts are all 12 or 13 jin heavy, called seven-width quilts), a leading dragon foreign cloth lining, a floral quilt cover, and also made 28 single-layer clothes, two pairs of rubber boots, a fountain pen for meetings, a diary, etc., all new. He also said: "I have never brushed my teeth before, so I bought a toothbrush and toothpaste to brush my teeth." This is what Wan Fenglou personally told me at the inspection symposium. When he spoke, he was all smiles and very happy. Everyone who participated in the symposium proved that Wan Fenglou had made a major turnaround, and said that Wan Fenglou is now the director of supervision. At this point, everyone in the audience and Wan Fenglou clapped and laughed happily.

At the symposium, the cooperative directors Wan Mingsheng, Wan Yanran, etc. also took out an account book for me to see, saying: "The whole cooperative has 138 households, and the cooperative coordinated tailoring clothes for 720 yuan. The whole cooperative added 40 new 12-jin heavy quilts, the quilt linings were all leading dragon foreign cloth, and the quilt covers were all made of printed straight tribute cloth. They also made 753 single clothes, 168 lined clothes, 175 cotton clothes, bought 15 pairs of rubber shoes, 10 pairs of rubber boots, 210 flannel jackets and trousers, 103 pairs of socks, 28 pairs of gloves, 3 mosquito nets, and 13 scarves. In addition to this, many households hired tailors to make clothes on their own. In 1956, the whole cooperative also bought 385 yuan of public bonds." Because of literacy, everyone reads and studies, and the whole cooperative bought more than 40 fountain pens worth more than one yuan each. After the symposium, I also visited the Wanjia Flower House area. It happened that Wan Fenglou's son Wan Yinnan, daughter-in-law Nie Manlan, and many members were working in the fields applying fertilizer. When they saw me coming, they were all happy to talk to me, exchanged greetings, and everyone said, we lived a dark and painful life under the Kuomintang reactionaries. It's really hard to describe in words. Only after the Chinese Communist Party came did we gradually embark on the bright and happy road. We all know that working individually is not as good as mutual aid teams, mutual aid teams are not as good as elementary cooperatives, and elementary cooperatives are not as good as advanced cooperatives. When organized, there are more people and greater strength, irrigation, flood prevention, drainage, disaster relief, drought resistance, overcoming natural disasters, mutual assistance and mutual benefit, all have special benefits. We only established the advanced cooperative in the winter of 1955, and we have truly made a major turnaround in just one year. Chairman Mao is like the sun, shining brightly everywhere. We thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. In the past, we had to take begging sticks after the fifteenth day of the first lunar month. Now, take this year as an example, we have each been allocated more than 700 jin of grain, and also allocated a lot of money, made a lot of clothes, and bought a lot of things. It's rice followed by wheat, and wheat followed by rice. We are really walking with a skip and sleeping with a smile. Someone compares the current cooperative to bamboo shoots in spring, growing taller and taller. They also said: According to the experience of changing to double-cropping rice in 1956, we must adapt to the time and local conditions. The first season of rice must be planted in 60 days of drought, the second season of rice must be planted late in the dog days, and rapeseed or March yellow barley must be planted after the second season of rice is harvested in order to catch up with the season. We have already made plans for 1957 to consolidate and develop the advantages of 1956, correct the shortcomings of 1956, and ensure that our annual output exceeds 1,039 jin and 14 liang in 1956. When you come to inspect again after the autumn harvest of 1957 or in 1958, our cooperative will definitely be better than this year. We will be much better in five years.

Fellow committee members, fellow comrades, China used to be a backward country. It has only been a short eight years since liberation. Which aspect has not progressed rapidly and achieved amazing results? The progress of our Anhui is the same as that of the whole country, with new construction everywhere. Take Hefei as an example. Before liberation, it was a dilapidated small city with a population of less than 40,000. Now the population has reached more than 300,000. The streets, roads, houses, factories, schools, agriculture, the Foziling Meishan Reservoir, etc., have indeed made rapid progress and achieved remarkable results. Anyone who has been to Hefei can prove that these words of mine are not false. Even with only one year of the upsurge of agricultural cooperation, the agricultural cooperatives have already achieved such superior results, which is already a very rare thing. If we look at new things with old eyes, then we are truly mistaken. I am an old person and often feel that I did not participate in the revolution and do good things for the people in the past. On the contrary, I made a living under the reactionaries. But the Party still cultivates me with such high regard, which really makes me feel grateful and ashamed in my conscience. In this feeling of gratitude and shame, I met a leading comrade of the Party. He said to me, it is good that you think this way, but the past is already past and there is no need to regret it. The cause of the revolution has only just begun. As long as you do not doubt and firmly stand for serving the people, it is still not too late. Your future is still bright and glorious. I hope you will work hard. These words gave me great inspiration and education. I sincerely thank him. I think that since we have already been mistaken in the past, we must never be mistaken again in the future. If we make mistakes again and again, then it would be truly unimaginable. We must be responsible to the country, responsible to ourselves, and wholeheartedly, loyally, honestly, and resolutely take the socialist road. We must affirm the superiority of socialism. We must resolutely and forever unite around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and fight to the end for the socialist construction cause. We must also fight to the end for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Let us advance together.

    张东野说
    我在潜山看到了一些新鲜事物
    我在会议中听到了周总理、李副总理、陈副主席的报告，受到了无限的鼓舞和教育；尤其见到了英明伟大、慈祥仁爱的毛主席，并听到了毛主席的指示。毛主席在指示中好像家人骨肉一样的亲切，这实在是使我更受到无限感动，无限温暖。毛主席所指示的各项问题，我们应该好好的学习，作为我们工作中的指针。
    各位委员，各位同志，在1955年的冬季，全国农业合作化高潮到来的时候，大家都热烈高兴的说合作化的优越好处；到了1956年秋冬间有人对农业合作化又有些不同的看法。由于这些言三语四，把我这个旧意识的人也搞模糊起来了。在今年春节后安徽组织了省人民代表和省政协委员分别视察，我也视察了合肥郊区淮联农业高级社，同时又看了我的故乡潜山县罗汉乡中心高级等社。这个社是千斤社，我看过这些社以后，才感觉到那些不同的看法和不同的说法，多是未从全面看问题，以耳代目，结合自己的旧意识主观想像而传说的。毛主席说：“没有调查研究就没有发言权”，我这才有了真正的领会。我现在先说一说合肥郊区的淮联社。淮联社是1956年春高潮时建立为高级社的，有农户六百六十四户，社员三千零二十人，耕地七千五百亩（该社原有土地八千余亩，因建水库减为七千五百亩，内除园地二百余亩，实有七千二百余亩），耕牛二百四十四头，大型农具四百五十三件。它1956年粮食总产量三百一十二万零一百三十五斤，1955年总产量二百五十九万一千四百八十四斤，1956年比1955年要增产五十二万多斤，1955年平均每亩三百一十三斤多，1956年平均每亩四百三十三斤多，这说明1956年成立高级社后比1955年平均每亩增产一百二十多斤。1956年农副业总产值三十三万八千六百八十五元，分与社员二十四万四千七百三十七元，占总收入72％。每个劳动日九角，平均每户收入三百六十八元五角，每人平均收入约八十一元。最突出的一户，阮贞庆家十四口人有七个劳动力，全年收入一千七百一十五元。
    淮联社自合作化推行“三改”办法以后，社员的收入按照上面所说情况，的确都大大提高了。我想农村里每个人平均每年能收入八十一元，在现在的条件下，生活也就不算坏了，而且像阮贞庆劳力多的这一户，竟收到一千七百一十五元，这个生活还有什么不快活呢？总之农业合作化的优越性我们是用不着丝毫怀疑的。但在前进过程中缺点自然难免的，淮联社因为种西瓜，社干没有掌握好因地制宜，它在1956年生产中，把三十亩黄土旱地种了西瓜，有经验的社员和有些社干说黄土种不得西瓜，只能种胜利百号山芋，他们不听，结果只结了几个小饭碗大的西瓜，大家就在地里打着哈哈摘着吃掉了。这位社干，深知自己错了便开大会作了检讨，吸取了这个经验教训，今年就决定种胜利百号山芋。
    各位委员，各位同志，我们对淮联社如若不说全面的成绩，只说这三十亩西瓜种坏了，我们就把淮联社全面的好处一概抹煞，以耳代目，甚至连农业合作化的优越性也推翻了，这是不是合理呢？我想我们决不会这样看问题的。现在我要谈谈我的故乡潜山县农业合作中人民兴高彩烈的生活情况。我到潜山看到了一些新鲜事物，使我作梦都想不到的。潜山是个山县，过去很穷苦，在1956年才全部实现高级农业合作化，1956年农民生产情绪空前高涨，充分发挥了合作化的有利条件，积极推行了农业三项改革。耕地复种指数达到234％，种双季稻十三万七千亩，为1955年的二十倍。1956年粮食总产量为二万三千六百五十四万斤，比历史上产量最高的1955年多收五千一百五十一万多斤，即增产27.8％。全县并出现了三个千斤社，内中有个罗汉乡中心社，平均每亩，年产量一千零三十九斤十四两。这个罗汉乡中心社是在1955年冬由两个小社和五个互助组合并组成的高级社。全社一百三十八户，五百九十三口人，男女整半劳动力一百七十个，有水田八百零九点四五亩，旱地二十亩，这个社在罗汉乡十四个社当中土地要算最孬。由于成立高级社，集体经营，发挥了合作化的优越性，突出的表现在粮食增产，这个社的1956年生产成绩，达到了安徽省里所提出来的土地、猪、牛三增产的要求。单以粮食耕地七百二十八点八五亩计算，共收粮食七十三万一千六百八十八斤，平均每亩产量一千零三十九点一四斤，比1955年粮食总产量增加58％，因此他们便成了千斤社。但还有油菜子、花生没有计算在内。在副业中养猪工作也有很大的发展，猪的头数比1955年增加了233％，除超额完成国家派购肥猪任务二十五头外，社内还公宰肥猪二十二头，私人自宰的还很多，现在全社养猪一百五十六头又小猪七十九头，耕牛1955年原有三十四头，1956年增加到四十二头，比1955年增加八头。
    这个中心社里有个万家花屋，离县城十五里，这屋里共有十七户人家，解放前穷的出奇，那个村子里有十八根半讨饭棍子，其中有个名叫万凤楼的，他现在有四十多岁，是贫农出身，家有五口人，过去种了桂家公堂的几亩田，每年除缴租请东家大吃大喝外，家中就没有了余粮，一家人每年都是靠讨饭过活，他家就有二根半讨饭棍子（老婆一根，媳妇半根，他自己一根），儿子帮人看牛，仅仅糊口，一家人饥寒困苦不堪。解放后，他照五口人分得了田和房子，由互助组到初级社，渐渐的解决了他的困难。1955年他的二根半棍子算是全都丢了，但在生活上还有小困难。到了1956年他算大翻了身。万凤楼的儿子叫万银南，在社里喂牛，得了二次劳模，他的儿媳聂满兰，也得了二次劳模。因此大家都说：万银南、聂满兰夫妻二人双戴花。万凤楼一家人做了四百多个劳动日，连三定粮以及多劳多得增产等等每人分粮七百二十斤，五口人共得三千六百斤粮，另外还分了二百六十多元。9月里杀肥猪一口，过年又杀肥猪一口，两口肥猪又卖得了一百多元，因此就做了直贡呢新棉袄、裤两套，打了十二斤重的被絮一床（潜山习惯被条都是十二、三斤重名曰七幅被），龙头洋布里子，花被面子，又做了单夹衣二十八件，胶皮靴两双，开会用的自来水笔，日记簿等等都买了一个全新，他还说：“我从来未刷过牙，我还买了牙刷子、牙膏，来刷刷牙齿”。这是万凤楼在视察座谈会上亲自对我说的，他说话时眉开眼笑，欢天喜地，全场参加座谈的人都证明万凤楼大大翻了身，并说万凤楼现在当了监察主任，说到这里全场的人和万凤楼都兴高彩烈鼓掌欢笑。
    在座谈会上社长万明生、万俨然等还拿出一本账来给我看，说：“全社一百三十八户由社里统筹做衣的裁缝工花了七百二十元，全社添置了十二斤重的新被絮四十床，被里子都是龙头洋布，被面都是印花直贡呢做的，又做了单衣七百五十三件，夹衣一百六十八件，棉衣一百七十五件，还买了胶鞋十五双，胶靴十双，绒布褂裤二百一十件，袜子一百零三双，手套二十八双，帐子三床，围巾十三条，除此以外每户自找裁缝做衣的还很多。1956年全社还买了公债三百八十五元”。因为扫盲，大家读书学习，全社买了每支一元多的自来水笔四十多支。开了座谈会后，我又到万家花屋一带访问，正好万凤楼的儿子万银南、媳妇聂满兰和许多社员都在田里挑肥工作，大家见我来了，都高兴的和我谈话，互相问好，大家说，我们在国民党反动派时过的是黑暗痛苦日子，实在一言难尽，中国共产党来过以后，我们才渐渐走上了光明幸福大道，我们都知道了单干不如互助组好，互助组不如初级社好，初级社不如高级社好，组织起来人多力量大，灌溉、防洪、排涝、救灾、抗旱、战胜自然灾害，互助互济，都有特别好处。我们在1955年冬成立了高级社才只一年，就真正大翻身了，毛主席好像太阳一样，照得遍地光明，我们感谢共产党和毛主席，过去过了正月十五就要拿讨饭棍子，现在就拿今年说，我们每人都分得七百多斤粮食，还分了许多钱，做了许多衣，买了许多东西，是稻接麦，麦接稻，真是走路都带跳，睡觉都带哈哈笑。有人把现在的合作社比做春天的竹笋节节高。他们还说：根据1956年改种双季稻的经验证明因时制宜，因地制宜，第一季稻必须插六十天旱，第二季稻必须插伏脚晚，第二季稻收割后必须种油菜或三月黄大麦，才能赶上季节，我们1957年业已做好计划，巩固和发展1956年的优点，改正1956年的缺点，要保证我们的年产量超过1956年一千零三十九斤十四两，1957年秋收后或1958年，你再来视察时，我们的社一定要比今年好，五年内我们就要大大的好起来了。
    各位委员，各位同志，我们中国过去是一个落后的国家，解放以来才只有短短的八年，那一样不是一日千里成绩惊人呢？我们安徽的进步也与全国一样建设一新，即拿合肥来说，解放前是个破烂不堪的小城市，人口不到四万，现在人口已达三十万强，街市、马路、房屋、工厂、学校、农业、佛子岭梅山水库等等，确实突飞猛进成绩显著，到过合肥的一定都可证明我这些话不是虚言。即如农业合作高潮才只有一年，而农业社已有了这样优越的成绩，这已经是很难得的事了。我们如拿旧眼光来看新事物，那就真正错误了。我是个旧人员，常常感到过去没有参加革命为人民作一点好事，相反的还在反动派下面混饭吃，而党还是这样高厚的培养我，实在令我良心上既感且愧。就在这个感愧当中遇到一位党的领导同志，他对我说，你这样想法是好的，但过去的事已经过去了，也不必追悔，革命的事业才开始，只要你不怀疑，坚定立场为人民服务还是来得及的，你的前途还是光明而光荣的，望你努力吧。这几句话使我得到了很大的启发和教育，我衷心的感谢他。我想我们既已贻误于前，决不可再错误于后了。如一误再误，那就真正不堪设想了。我们要对国家负责，要对自己负责，我们要全心全意忠诚老实坚决走社会主义道路。我们要把社会主义优越性肯定起来，我们要坚决的永远团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，为社会主义建设事业奋斗到底，我们还要为和平解放台湾而奋斗到底。我们共同前进吧。
