    Writers and Merchants
    Li Wenjun

    I read about the following incident in the American "Saturday Review."

    The editor of a newly founded American magazine wrote to Ernest Hemingway, asking him to write something for the magazine gratuitously, "to bring unparalleled glory to this new magazine and help it develop smoothly." We know that in the United States, the fees for writers like Hemingway are astonishingly high, beyond the means of ordinary small magazines.

    After reading this letter, Hemingway was furious. He said, "What does this guy think I am? Does he think I'm an artist? I am a businessman who happens to have chosen writing as a means of making a living. I can't waste my time for nothing. This kind of person needs to be taught a lesson." So he sat down at the typewriter and wrote a sarcastic letter to the "ungrateful" editor. We don't know the content of the letter, only that he "told the editor what life is all about in very clear terms." This letter was densely written across three pages, and after finishing it, he read it to his friend. The friend nodded in approval and said, "Ernest, this is your most brilliant article in recent years. Maybe it's longer than the editor ever hoped for in his wildest dreams, and he'll put this article on the front page, but he won't give you a single cent for it."

    Upon hearing this, Hemingway tore the letter to shreds and threw it into the wastepaper basket. The editor's "business sense" was no match for the writer's "business sense"!

    I do not doubt Hemingway's creative talent and artistic achievement, but the fact that he would put on a straight face and admit that he is a businessman is worthy of our deep thought. In the United States, money has so corrupted the souls of writers! No wonder another famous American writer, John Steinbeck, upon hearing the news of the success of his "Of Mice and Men," cried and panicked, shouting: "This is my first success! I am terribly afraid. I'm afraid! I don't want money! ... What will become of me in the future?"

    Steinbeck cried with good reason, and feared with good reason! Isn't it difficult to find that rebellious spirit of his "The Grapes of Wrath" in his recent works?

    作家和商人
    李文俊
    在美国出版的“星期六评论”上看到下面一件事情。
    美国一个新创办的杂志的编辑写信给厄奈斯特·海明威，要求他义务地为杂志写一篇东西，“使这个新杂志得到无上的光荣，借以帮助杂志顺利地发展。”我们知道，在美国，像海明威这样作家的稿费高得惊人，不是寻常的小杂志所能负担的。
    看了这封信以后，海明威大发雷霆。他说：“这个家伙以为我是什么人？以为我是艺术家吗？我是一个碰巧挑中写作为谋生之术的商人。我可不能白白糟蹋我的时间。这样的人得好好训他一顿才行。”于是他就坐到打字机前面，写了一封挖苦的信给那个“不识好歹”的编辑。信的内容我们不知道，只知道他“用极为明确的话告诉那个编辑人生是怎么一回事。”这封信写了密密麻麻的三页，写完后念给他的朋友听。这个朋友赞许地点点头，接着说：“厄奈斯特，这是你近年来最最精采的一篇文章。也许它要比那个编辑在他最荒唐的梦里所希望的还要长，他准把这篇文章登在最前面，至于钱，他连一个子儿也不会给你的。”
    海明威听了这话，就把信撕得粉碎，扔到字纸篓里去了。那位编辑的“生意眼”哪里敌得过这位作家的“生意眼”！
    我并不怀疑海明威的创作才能和艺术成就，但他居然板起面孔，承认自己是个商人，这就值得我们深思的了。在美国，金钱就这样腐蚀了作家的灵魂！无怪另一个美国著名作家约翰·史坦贝克当初听到他的“人鼠之间”得到成功的消息时，一面啜泣一面恐慌地喊道： “这是我的第一次成功！我害怕得要命。我害怕呀！我不要有钱！……我今后会变成什么样呢？”
    史坦贝克哭得有理，怕得有理！他的“愤怒的葡萄”里那种叛逆的气质在他近来的作品里不是很难找到的了吗？
