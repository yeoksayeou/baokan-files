Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Stencil plates, which have always been made of steel, can now be replaced by a glass product. Under the examination of precise magnifying instruments, the serrations and the depth of the lines of this glass product are the same as ordinary stencil plates. Using an ordinary stylus and stencil paper on it to cut stencils does not produce fuzz, nor is it easily torn. Its line patterns are also more uniform than ordinary stencil plates. Its shortcomings are that it is easily broken and its wear resistance is poor.

This glass product is made by the staff of the Tianjin Mimeograph Machine Factory and Tianjin No. 5 Mechanical Industry Company using screen printing plates and chemical reagents, using a method similar to developing photographs.

    用玻璃代替钢铁制成刻字板
    据新华社讯　一向用钢铁制造的刻字钢板，现在可以用一种玻璃制品代替。在精密的放大仪器检查下，这种用玻璃做成的产品的齿纹和纹的深度和普通刻字钢板一样。用普通的铁笔和蜡纸在它上面刻字，不会起毛，也不容易划破。它的纹形还比普通刻字钢板均匀。它的缺点是容易碰碎和耐磨度较差。
    这种玻璃制品是天津市油印机厂和天津市第五机械工业公司的职工利用网幕板和化学药品，用类似洗相片的方法制成的。
