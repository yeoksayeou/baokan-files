Xinhua News Agency, March 27th - Joint Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic.

At the invitation of the Government of the People's Republic of China, a delegation of the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic, headed by Prime Minister Viliam Široký, paid a friendly visit to China in March 1957.

The members of the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic were: O. Šimůnek, Chairman of the State Planning Commission; O. Černík, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia; V. David, Minister of Foreign Affairs; J. Ďuriš, Minister of Finance; E. Slechta, Chairman of the State Construction Commission; J. Plojhar, Minister of Health; J. Kyselý, Minister of Local Economy; A. Gregor, Ambassador of the Czechoslovak Republic to the People's Republic of China; O. Kožol, Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade.

During the visit, Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, received the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic.

During the visit, the leaders of the two governments also held talks. Participating in the talks on the Chinese side were Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Vice Premiers of the State Council He Long, Li Fuchun, Bo Yibo, Director of the State Construction Commission Wang Heshou, Minister of Foreign Trade Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing, Minister of Health Li Dequan, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, and Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the Czechoslovak Republic Cao Ying.

Participating on the Czechoslovak side were Prime Minister Viliam Široký and all members of the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic.

In a cordial, sincere, and friendly atmosphere, the two sides exchanged views extensively on the current international situation and on issues related to further consolidating the solidarity of socialist countries and developing friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries, and reached a consensus. Through these talks, the two countries concluded the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Czechoslovak Republic, and signed the Sino-Czech Cultural Cooperation Agreement and the Sino-Czech Health Cooperation Agreement.

During the visit, the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic visited some major cities, factories, enterprises, construction projects, agricultural production cooperatives, cultural and welfare undertakings, and historical sites of China. The achievements of the Chinese people in developing their industry, agriculture, and culture, as well as the determination of the Chinese people to build socialism and defend peace, left a deep impression on the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic. The meeting between the representatives of the Czechoslovak people and the Chinese people and their representatives once again reflected the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the two peoples.

I

The two sides exchanged views on the current international situation and various international issues of common concern to the two governments.

The two sides pointed out that the process of gradual relaxation of international tension in the past few years was temporarily disrupted in the autumn of 1956 due to the military aggression of the imperialist aggressive forces against Egypt and the subversive activities against Hungary. However, the socialist countries, nationalist countries, and all other peace-loving countries and peoples resolutely opposed the imperialist countries' conspiracy to recreate tensions. At the same time, the Egyptian people and the Hungarian people achieved victory in the struggle against the forces of imperialist aggression, thus making it possible for the international situation to re-emerge towards relaxation.

The imperialist aggressive forces will not be reconciled to their defeat, and they are continuing to carry out various conspiracies. This requires the people of all countries in the world to remain vigilant at all times and continue to strengthen the struggle to safeguard peace. In this struggle, socialist countries must further strengthen their unity, consolidate their strength, and at the same time, unite with nationalist countries and all other peace-loving countries and peoples to work together to continue to oppose the war conspiracies of the imperialist aggressive forces.

Facts in recent years have proved that the imperialist policies of aggression and war have become increasingly unpopular, and the will and actions of peace-loving countries and peoples are increasingly powerfully influencing the development of the international situation. The general trend in the world is towards relaxation and towards progress. As long as all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world unite and work together in the struggle against the war conspiracies of the imperialist aggressive forces, and in the struggle to achieve peaceful coexistence among all countries and to ease international tensions, the peace and happiness of all mankind can be effectively guaranteed.

The two sides expressed their firm opposition to the series of activities of the imperialist aggressive forces in reviving West German militarism, such as arming the West German defense forces with atomic weapons and appointing former Hitler senior military officers to command positions in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. These activities not only threaten peace in Europe, but also endanger the interests of all German people, including the West German people.

The two sides fully support the efforts made by the German Democratic Republic to unify Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis. The two sides agree with the position of the German Democratic Republic that the unification of Germany should be resolved through mutual understanding and rapprochement between the two Germanies on the above-mentioned basis.

The two sides believe that the recent proposal by six Western European countries, including West Germany, to establish a so-called "Common Market" and "European Atomic Energy Community" in Europe is an exclusive organization composed of members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which will bring dangerous consequences to the European people. The two sides support the Soviet government's proposal of March 16, 1957, on the establishment of a pan-European atomic energy cooperation agency and economic cooperation in pan-Europe, and believe that the implementation of these proposals will greatly benefit the economic development of European countries and the relaxation of the international situation.

The Warsaw Treaty is a self-defense organization established after the establishment of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization in order to prevent the expansion of German militarist forces. The People's Republic of China fully supports the purpose of this organization and the measures it has taken. The two sides also pointed out that, as the Warsaw Treaty member states have always advocated, both the Warsaw Treaty and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should be replaced by a pan-European collective security system.

The two sides strongly condemned the "Eisenhower Doctrine" recently put forward by the United States. The essence of this policy of the United States is to suppress national independence movements, squeeze Britain and France out of the Near and Middle East, and expand its own colonial forces under the pretext of anti-communism and anti-Sovietism, and by means of creating tensions. This new colonialist policy of the United States is the main threat to the sovereignty and independence of the countries in the Near and Middle East today.

Socialist countries have consistently advocated respect for the sovereignty and independence of the countries in the Near and Middle East, and advocated that the people of the Near and Middle East should decide their own affairs. The purpose of the Soviet government's proposal to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on February 11, 1957, is to ensure the independence, security, and peaceful development of the countries in the Near and Middle East. Although the United States, Britain, and France have regrettably rejected this constructive proposal, the two sides still believe that the Soviet proposal is a reasonable way to solve the problems in the Near and Middle East.

The two sides reiterated their continued support for the just struggle of the people of the countries in the Near and Middle East against colonialism, supported the just demand of the Egyptian government that the aggressors compensate for the material losses they caused in Egypt, and advocated that the Suez Canal issue be resolved through consultation on the principle of fully respecting Egyptian sovereignty.

The two sides welcomed the end of the state of war and the establishment of diplomatic relations between Czechoslovakia and Japan, and believed that this not only conformed to the interests of the people of Czechoslovakia and Japan, but also contributed to the cause of world peace.

The two sides reiterated their support for the efforts made by the Korean and Vietnamese peoples to achieve the reunification of their motherlands on a peaceful and democratic basis. China is satisfied with the efforts made by Czechoslovakia, together with other countries, in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea, and believes that this effort is an important contribution to maintaining peace in the Far East.

The two sides stated that the two governments will continue to support the just struggle of the countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America for national independence, and will establish and strengthen friendly and cooperative relations with these countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

The two sides believe that all military blocs should be replaced by a system of collective security and collective peace. The establishment of a European collective security system and a collective peace system in Asia and the Pacific region is in the interests of world peace.

The two sides reiterated that the two governments actively support the disarmament proposal put forward by the Soviet government on March 18, 1957, and believe that in today's situation, it is important to reach an agreement on certain partial issues even within the overall disarmament issue. The two sides pointed out that the proposal on first stopping nuclear weapon tests is of particular importance, and its realization will be the first step towards the complete prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

The two sides reiterated that the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems is the basic guideline of the two countries' foreign policies. The two governments are willing to guide their relations with all countries by this principle. The two sides stated that the two governments will continue to make every effort to work with other peace-loving countries and peoples to safeguard world peace, so that there will be increasing understanding, mutual trust, and cooperation among the people of all countries in the world.

II

The two sides believe that the close unity and friendly cooperation between socialist countries is the most reliable guarantee for the cause of socialism and world peace. At present, under the circumstances that imperialist aggressive groups are intensifying their subversive and provocative activities against socialist countries, it is of particular importance to further strengthen and consolidate the unity and cooperation of socialist countries.

The two sides believe that the Soviet Union's assistance to the Hungarian people in defeating the restoration conspiracy of the counter-revolutionary forces has powerfully safeguarded peace in Europe and the world. The two sides reiterated their firm support for the Hungarian People's Republic Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, firmly opposed all attempts by imperialist reactionary forces to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs, and will continue to help the Hungarian people overcome the difficulties they are currently encountering.

The two sides unanimously pointed out that socialist countries are linked together by the ideals and cause of communism, and that the relations between them are based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism on proletarian internationalism and the complete equality of all nations. The two sides expressed their firm determination to continue to further consolidate and strengthen the unity among socialist countries on the principles of complete equality, mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in internal affairs.

The two sides believe that the Soviet government's declaration of October 30, 1956, on the basis for the development and further strengthening of friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, as well as the series of talks held between socialist countries and the communiqués and statements issued thereafter, are of extreme importance for improving the mutual relations between socialist countries, further consolidating the unity of socialist countries, and strengthening the struggle of the people of socialist countries against the forces of imperialist aggression. The People's Republic of China believes that the friendly visit of the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic to all Asian socialist countries has once again made an important contribution to promoting mutual understanding, unity, and cooperation among socialist countries. The two governments will continue to regard maintaining and strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union as their top international obligation.

III

The two sides noted with satisfaction that the friendly and cooperative relations between the People's Republic of China and the Czechoslovak Republic have been continuously developing and consolidating in recent years. Political cooperation between the two countries is becoming closer, economic cooperation is expanding, the total trade volume between the two countries is increasing year by year, and the content of cultural cooperation between the two countries is becoming richer. China thanks the Czechoslovak Republic for the various assistance it has given to China's construction cause. This mutual support and cooperation effectively promotes the socialist construction of the two countries and creates favorable preconditions for further deepening economic and technological cooperation between the two countries.

In order to further strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries, the two sides concluded the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Czechoslovak Republic through this meeting. This treaty affirms the existing indestructible friendly relations between the people of the two countries, and creates favorable conditions for further cooperation between the two countries in the political, economic, cultural and other fields in the future.

The two sides also signed the Sino-Czech Cultural Cooperation Agreement and the Sino-Czech Health Cooperation Agreement. The new agreement summarizes the achievements and experiences already gained in cultural and health cooperation between the two countries, and will further promote cooperation between the two countries in these areas.

Prime Minister Viliam Široký, head of the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic, on behalf of the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic, invited Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China to visit the Czechoslovak Republic together with other leaders of the Chinese government. Premier Zhou Enlai gladly accepted this invitation.

The two sides are deeply convinced that the visit of the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic to the People's Republic of China and the talks between the leaders of the two governments and their results have made a significant contribution to the further development of the fraternal relations between the two countries, to the further enhancement of the unity of socialist countries, and to the consolidation of world peace.

    双方在亲切诚挚和友好的空气中对目前国际形势，对进一步巩固社会主义国家团结和发展两国的友好合作关系问题广泛地交换了意见，并取得了一致的看法。通过这次会谈，两国缔结了中华人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国友好合作条约，签订了中捷文化合作协定和中捷保健合作协定。
    在访问期间，捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团参观了中华人民共和国的一些主要城市、工厂、企业、建设工程、农业生产合作社、文化福利事业和中国悠久的历史古迹。中国人民在发展自己的工业、农业和文化方面所取得的成就，以及中国人民建设社会主义和保卫和平事业的决心，给捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团留下了深刻的印象。捷克斯洛伐克人民的代表同中国人民及其代表的会见，再一次体现了两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊。
　　一
　　双方对目前国际形势和两国政府所共同关心的各种国际问题交换了意见。
    双方指出，过去几年来国际紧张局势逐步走向和缓的过程，在1956年的秋季由于帝国主义侵略势力对埃及的军事进攻和对匈牙利的颠复活动，遭到了一时的破坏。但是，社会主义国家、民族主义国家和其他一切爱好和平的国家和人民坚决反对帝国主义国家重新制造紧张局势的阴谋，同时，埃及人民和匈牙利人民在反对帝国主义侵略势力的斗争中获得胜利，这样就使国际局势重新出现了趋于和缓的可能。
    帝国主义侵略势力是不会甘心于他们的失败的，他们还在继续进行各种阴谋活动。这就需要全世界各国人民随时保持警惕，继续加强维护和平的斗争。在这一斗争中，社会主义各国必须进一步加强团结，巩固自己的力量，同时，联合民族主义国家和其他一切爱好和平的国家和人民，共同努力，继续反对帝国主义侵略势力的战争阴谋。
    几年来的事实证明，帝国主义的侵略和战争的政策已经越来越不得人心，爱好和平的国家和人民的意志和行动越来越有力地影响着国际局势的发展，世界总的趋势是走向和缓、走向进步的。只要世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民在反对帝国主义侵略势力的战争阴谋的斗争中，在争取一切国家和平共处和和缓国际紧张局势的斗争中，团结一致，共同努力，全人类的和平和幸福就能够得到有力的保障。
    双方表示坚决反对帝国主义侵略势力以原子武器武装西德国防军和任命原希特勒的高级军官担任北大西洋公约司令职务等一系列复活西德军国主义的活动。这些活动不但威胁着欧洲的和平，而且也危害了包括西德人民在内的全体德国人民的利益。
    双方完全支持德意志民主共和国为在和平和民主的基础上统一德意志所作的努力。双方赞同德意志民主共和国的立场，即两个德国应该在上述的基础上通过互相谅解和接近的途径来解决德意志的统一问题。
    双方认为，最近由包括西德在内的西欧六国所提出的在欧洲建立所谓“共同市场”和“欧洲原子能联营组织”，是一个由北大西洋公约成员国所组成的排他性的组织，它将给欧洲人民带来危险的后果。双方支持苏联政府1957年3月16日关于建立全欧原子能合作机构和在全欧进行经济合作的建议，并且认为这些建议的实施将大大有利于欧洲各国的经济发展和国际局势的和缓。
    华沙条约是为了防止德国军国主义势力的扩张，在侵略性的北大西洋公约成立后被迫建立的自卫组织。中华人民共和国完全支持这一组织的目的和它所采取的措施。双方同时指出，正如同华沙条约参加国始终主张的一样，华沙条约和北大西洋公约都应当由全欧的集体安全体系所代替。
    双方强烈谴责美国最近所提出来的“艾森豪威尔主义”。美国这个政策的实质就是以反共、反苏为借口，以制造紧张局势为手段，来达到镇压民族独立运动、把英法从中近东地区排挤出去和扩大自己殖民势力的目的。美国这种新的殖民主义政策是当前对中近东各国主权和独立的主要威胁。
    社会主义国家一贯主张尊重中近东国家的主权和独立，主张由中近东人民自己决定中近东的事务。苏联政府在1957年2月11日向美、英、法三国政府提出的建议，其目的就在于使中近东各国的独立、安全和和平发展得到保障。美、英、法三国虽然令人遗憾地拒绝了这一建设性的建议，双方仍然认为苏联的建议是解决中近东问题的一个合理的途径。
    双方重申继续支持中近东各国人民反殖民主义的正义斗争，支持埃及政府提出的由侵略者赔偿他们在埃及造成的物质损失的正义要求，并且主张在完全尊重埃及主权的原则下，通过协商的途径来解决苏伊士运河问题。
    双方欢迎捷克斯洛伐克和日本之间战争状态的结束和外交关系的建立，并且认为这不仅符合于捷日两国人民的利益，而且也是有利于世界和平的事业的。
    双方重申支持朝鲜人民和越南人民为在和平和民主的基础上实现他们祖国统一所作的努力。中国对于捷克斯洛伐克在朝鲜中立国监察委员会同其他国家一起所作的努力表示满意，并且认为这种努力是对于维护远东和平的一项重要贡献。
    双方表示，两国政府将继续支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家争取和维护民族独立的正义斗争，并且将在和平共处五项原则的基础上建立和加强同这些国家的友好合作关系。
    双方认为，一切军事集团应该为集体安全和集体和平的体系所代替。建立欧洲的集体安全体系和亚洲、太平洋地区的集体和平体系是符合于世界和平的利益的。
    双方重申，两国政府积极支持苏联政府在1957年3月18日提出的裁军建议，并且认为在今天的局势下，即使在整个裁军问题中就某些局部问题达成协议也是重要的。双方指出，关于首先停止试验核子武器的建议有着特别重要的意义，它的实现将是走上完全禁止原子武器和氢武器的第一个步骤。
    双方重申，社会制度不同国家和平共处的原则是两国对外政策的基本方针。两国政府愿意以这一原则来指导他们同所有国家的关系。双方声明，两国政府将继续尽一切努力同其他爱好和平的国家和人民共同为维护世界和平而努力，使全世界各国人民间有着日益增长的谅解、互信和合作。
　　二
    双方认为，社会主义国家之间的亲密团结和友好合作是社会主义事业和世界和平的最可靠的保证。目前，在帝国主义侵略集团对社会主义国家加紧进行颠复和挑拨活动的情况下，进一步加强和巩固社会主义国家的团结和合作具有特别重要的意义。
    双方认为，苏联帮助匈牙利人民击败反革命力量的复辟阴谋，有力地维护了欧洲和世界的和平。双方重申坚决支持匈牙利人民共和国工农革命政府，坚决反对帝国主义反动势力干涉匈牙利内政的一切企图，并且将继续帮助匈牙利人民克服他们目前所遭遇到的困难。
    双方一致指出，社会主义国家是由共产主义的理想和事业联结在一起的，它们之间的相互关系是以马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级国际主义和各民族完全平等的原则为基础的。双方表示坚定的决心，继续在完全平等、互相尊重主权和领土完整和互不干涉内政的原则上，进一步巩固和加强社会主义国家间的团结。
    双方认为，苏联政府在1956年10月30日发表的关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言，以及在这以后社会主义国家之间所进行的一系列的会谈和所发表的公报和声明，对于改进社会主义各国的相互关系、进一步巩固社会主义各国的团结和加强社会主义各国人民反对帝国主义侵略势力的斗争，都具有极其巨大的意义。中华人民共和国认为这次捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团对所有亚洲社会主义国家进行的友好访问，对于促进社会主义国家互相了解和团结合作又一次作了重要的贡献。两国政府将继续把维护和加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结作为他们头等重要的国际义务。 三双方满意地指出，中华人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国之间的友好合作关系近年来不断获得发展和巩固。两国的政治合作日益密切，经济合作日益扩大，两国的贸易总额每年都有所增加，两国的文化合作内容也日益丰富。中国方面感谢捷克斯洛伐克共和国对于中国的建设事业所给予的各种援助。这种互相的支持和合作有效地促进着两国的社会主义建设，并且为进一步加深两国经济和技术合作创造着有利的前提。
    为了进一步加强两国的友好关系，双方通过这次会谈缔结了中华人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国友好合作条约。这个条约肯定了两国人民现有的牢不可破的友好关系，并且为两国今后在政治、经济和文化方面的进一步合作创造了有利的条件。
    双方同时还签订了中捷文化合作协定和中捷保健合作协定。新的协定总结了两国在文化和保健事业合作中所已经获得的成就和经验，并且将进一步促进两国在这些方面的合作。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团团长威廉·西罗基总理代表捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府邀请中华人民共和国周恩来总理同中国政府的其他领导人一起去访问捷克斯洛伐克共和国。周恩来总理高兴地接受了这一邀请。
    双方深信，捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团在中华人民共和国的访问和两国政府领导人的会谈及其结果，对于进一步发展两国的兄弟关系，对于进一步增强社会主义国家的团结和巩固世界和平作了重大的贡献。
