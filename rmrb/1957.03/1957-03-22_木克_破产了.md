　　"Muke" Goes Bankrupt
　　By Our Correspondent Hu Jibang

　　Months ago, the enemy spread a secret code among the Hungarian people: "Muke" (an abbreviation of "March Again Begins" in Hungarian, meaning an armed uprising would start again in March). This "Muke" spread widely in schools, and even every elementary school student knew what it meant. During January and February, when counter-revolutionary forces attacked the schools, "Muke" was particularly loud. On January 23, to commemorate the three-month anniversary of the armed rebellion, counter-revolutionary elements even staged small "Mukes" in individual schools.

　　March 15 is the anniversary of the Hungarian bourgeois democratic revolution and national liberation struggle of 1848. The youth of March 1848 occupy a particularly glorious page in Hungarian revolutionary history. Every year on March 15, the government gives students a day off. This year, the 16th was a holiday for headmasters, and the 17th was a Sunday, so students had three days off. During these days, government offices worked as usual, and coal miners produced more than 66,000 tons of coal on the eve of the 15th, reaching the highest record since the October events.

　　On the 14th, the government awarded the annual Kossuth Cultural Prize at the Parliament Building. Fifty-nine prominent scholars, artists, writers, and advanced industrial and agricultural producers gratefully accepted the highest awards given to them by the worker-peasant revolutionary government. In the evening, a grand commemorative meeting was held at the National Opera House. On the 15th, leaders and representatives of the Party, government, and various people's organizations laid countless wreaths in front of the Kossuth and Petőfi monuments. Everything proceeded according to past practice. Radio Free Europe lowered its demands on its "comrades-in-arms" in Hungary: on the one hand, it told them to be careful, and on the other hand, it hinted that it would be good if the "insurgents" could create some small disturbances. In their view, the "Muke" that had been clamoring for so long had to create at least one or two news stories for Western journalists to account for it!

　　However, three days passed, and the reports from police agencies across the country greatly disappointed Westerners. Not a single small incident occurred during these days. A scene of boiling, peaceful, and confident life could be seen everywhere in Budapest.

　　Of course, this does not mean that the counter-revolutionary forces have been completely eliminated, but rather that they have been subdued. On March 12, the Budapest Police Bureau arrested fourteen terrorists hiding in the tram company. They were exposed just as they were colluding with partners to prepare for new armed provocations. Some hidden weapons were also seized in schools in time, and some teachers and students who attempted to carry out counter-revolutionary activities were arrested.

　　On March 15, the Hungarian People's Police and the Public Security Forces were fully prepared, patrolling in groups of three or five in various places. The worker and staff guard teams of factories, mines, and important Party and government agencies wore brand-new gray khaki uniforms, some carrying automatic rifles and some holding pistols, taking turns guarding in front of their agencies.

　　Hungary's newly built armed forces have shown their power, and "Muke" has gone bankrupt shamefully. Counter-revolutionary underground organizations secretly mailed many letters and leaflets, calling on Hungarians to stay on the streets all day or not go to the streets for an hour on March 15 to express their opposition to the government. Someone asked, then do they include those sitting in cars or leaning against windowsills to look out? It would be better to say bluntly that everyone who opposes the Kadar government can only demonstrate with their breath on March 15.

　　The "Muke" that Radio Free Europe has been touting every day for months has thus vanished silently. Its situation in the Hungarian market is getting worse and worse. Now many young students and residents who have been misled by it have also awakened and said with disgust: "It's talking nonsense!"

　　“木克”破产了
　　本报记者　胡济邦
    几个月前敌人就在匈牙利人民中间散播一个暗语：“木克”（匈牙利文“3月再开始”的缩写，就是3月份再开始武装暴动的意思），这个“木克”在学校里传播得很广，连每一个小学生都知道是什么意思。在反革命势力向学校进攻的一、二月间，“木克”也叫得特别响。在1月23日，反革命分子为纪念武装暴乱三个月，还在个别学校里搞过小“木克”。
    3月15日是纪念1848年匈牙利资产阶级民主革命和民族解放斗争的日子。1848年3月的青年在匈牙利革命史中占着特别光辉的一页。每年3月15日政府给学生们放一天假，今年，16日是校长的假日，17日是星期日，这样，学生们就有了三天假期。这几天，机关照常工作，煤矿工人在15日的前夕生产了六万六千多吨煤，达到十月事件后最高的纪录。
    14日，政府在国会大厦颁发一年一度的科苏特文化奖金，五十九位著名的学者、艺术家、作家和工农业先进生产者以感谢的心情接受了工农革命政府给予他们的最高奖励。晚间，在国家歌剧院举行隆重的纪念大会。15日，党、政府和各人民团体的领导人和代表们在科苏特、裴多菲的纪念碑前献了无数的花圈。一切都照过去的惯例进行。“自由欧洲”电台对自己在匈牙利的“战友们”的广播已放低了要求：一方面叫他们小心，另一方面又暗示说，“起义者”如能制造一些小的骚乱也不坏。在他们看来，喧嚷这样久的“木克”，至少也要给西方记者制造一、两则新闻才能交代呀！
    但是，三天过去了，全国各地警察机关的汇报情况使西方人士大失所望。这几天没有发生过一次小的事件。在布达佩斯到处都可以看见一片沸腾的、安宁而有信心的生活气象。
    当然，这还不能说反革命势力已被完全消灭，而应该说是慑服了。3月12日，布达佩斯的警察局还逮捕了隐匿在电车公司中的十四名恐怖分子，他们正在串通伙伴准备进行新的武装挑衅的时候就被揭发了。在学校中也及时地搜出了一些隐藏的军火，逮捕了一些企图进行反革命活动的教师和学生。
    3月15日，匈牙利的人民警察和公安军进行了充分的戒备，他们三五成组，在各地巡逻。厂矿和重要党政机关的职工纠察队，这一天穿上崭新的灰色卡吉布制服，有的背着自动步枪，有的握着手枪，在自己机关门前轮流守卫着。
    匈牙利新建的武装力量显示了自己的威力，而“木克”可耻地破产了。反革命的地下组织秘密寄发许多信件和传单，上面号召匈牙利人在3月15日这天整天在街上或者用一个小时不上街，以表示自己对政府的反抗。有人就问，那末他们是否包括那些坐在汽车里或者倚靠窗门口张望的人们？倒不如干脆一点说，每一个反对卡达尔政府的人都只能在3月15日用自己的呼吸来示威了。
    “自由欧洲”电台几个月来所天天鼓吹的“木克”就这样无声无息地幻灭了。它在匈牙利的市场上每况愈下。现在有不少被它迷惑过的青年学生和居民也已经清醒过来了，而且厌恶地说：“它在胡扯！”
