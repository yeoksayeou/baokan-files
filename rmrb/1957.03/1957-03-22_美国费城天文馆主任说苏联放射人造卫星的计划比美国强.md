Xinhua News Agency, March 21st, Cincinnati Dispatch: Dr. Leavitt, Director of the Philadelphia Planetarium in the United States, recently said that the Soviet Union will launch an artificial satellite weighing about one hundred pounds during the International Geophysical Year, which will be five times heavier than the artificial satellite that the United States is going to launch. The instruments in the Soviet satellite will be fifteen times heavier than those in the American satellite.

Leavitt talked about the different methods used by Soviet and American scientists to launch artificial satellites. He said that the Soviet view is different from the American view. Americans believe that if they launch twelve medium-sized artificial satellites, it is likely that half of them will achieve satisfactory results. The Soviets advocate launching large artificial satellites. If the Soviet large artificial satellite can be launched successfully, they will be able to obtain more information about interstellar space than the Americans can obtain with six small "moons".

　　美国费城天文馆主任说苏联放射人造卫星的计划比美国强
    新华社21日讯　辛辛那提消息：美国费城天文馆主任勒维特博士最近说，苏联在国际地球物理年内将放射一颗重约一百磅的人造卫星，它将比美国要放射的人造卫星重五倍。苏联的人造卫星中的仪器将比美国人造卫星中的仪器重十五倍。
    勒维特谈到了苏、美两国科学家放射人造卫星的不同方法。他说，苏联人的看法同美国人不同。美国人认为如果发射出十二个中等大小的人造卫星，很可能其中有一半能够取得满意的收获。而苏联人主张放射大的人造卫星。如果苏联人的大人造卫星能够发射成功，他们所能得到的关于星际空间的情况将会比美国人靠六个小“月亮”所得到的为多。
