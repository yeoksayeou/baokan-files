CCP Lüda Municipal Committee Summarizes Experiences in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement
Demands Placing Political Work in the Primary Position

(From Our Newspaper) Recently, the CCP Lüda Municipal Committee summarized the main experiences of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement carried out over the past month, and put forward the requirements to comprehensively strengthen political and ideological work, fully mobilize the masses, and widely and deeply carry out the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement.

For more than a month, a mass-based Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement has unfolded in Lüda City. Because the Municipal Committee grasped political and ideological work from the beginning of the movement, placing it in the first place, many leading cadres went deep into reality during the movement, connected with the masses, solved problems, and implemented the principle of "from the masses, to the masses," combining general appeals with specific guidance. Therefore, many units have also achieved great economic results, overfulfilling the state's plans for January and February of this year.

The summary pointed out: There are still many problems in the current Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, mainly that conservative thinking is hindering the in-depth development of the movement. Specifically, many units neglect and do not pay attention to mobilizing the masses, do not value political and ideological work, do not see the positive factors in the movement, are not active or proactive, and shrink back and wait passively; some units do not sufficiently develop democracy and adhere to the democratic system, and the democratic life and democratic rights of the masses are often not given due respect, hindering the enthusiasm of the masses and their sense of responsibility as masters of the country; some units have a one-sided understanding of improving quality and making planning requirements fully reliable; some have departmentalism and lack an overall concept; and there is a complacent sense of pride in the status quo. The one-sidedness, superficiality, formalism, lack of practicality in propaganda work, and some problems in organizational leadership all need to be resolved.

In response to the above situation, the Municipal Committee's requirements for the next step of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement are: to comprehensively strengthen political and ideological work, fully mobilize the masses, and widely and deeply unfold the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement. In order to achieve this general requirement, the Municipal Committee hopes that all units will pay attention to the following specific requirements: Mobilize the masses to formulate, revise, and discuss Increase Production and Practice Economy targets, making them both advanced and reliable. All those who have already formulated targets must fully mobilize the masses to discuss and revise them, and organize the masses to achieve the targets; those who have not formulated them should mobilize the masses to formulate them; all Increase Production and Practice Economy figures and state plans that can be calculated separately should be calculated separately. At the same time, all units should formulate plans to streamline institutions and reduce staffing. Targets and plans must be formulated based on the principle of being both advanced and reliable and feasible. We must persist in carrying out the Advanced Producer (Advanced Worker) movement and the patriotic Increase Production movement, and strive to comprehensively overfulfill the state plan and various requirements for Increase Production and Practice Economy. In factories and enterprises, labor competitions should be widely carried out, collective contracts should be signed, and evaluation work should be done well; the mobilization of engineering and technical personnel and staff should be done well; and technical screening and raw material screening should be done well; in the movement, attention should be paid to the advanced and the backward, and even more attention should be paid to the work of ordinary producers.

The summary emphatically pointed out that leaders at all levels should still place comprehensively strengthening political and ideological work in the primary position in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement. Political and ideological work is the lifeline of all work and a guarantee for the comprehensive, in-depth, and healthy development of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement.

### 中共旅大市委总结增产节约运动经验　要求把政治工作放在首要地位

　　中共旅大市委总结增产节约运动经验
　　要求把政治工作放在首要地位
    本报讯　最近，中共旅大市委总结了一个多月来开展增产节约运动的主要经验，提出了全面加强政治思想工作，充分发动群众，广泛深入开展增产节约运动的要求。
    一个多月以来，群众性的增产节约运动已经在旅大市展开。由于市委在运动开始就抓住了政治思想工作，把政治思想工作放在第一位，不少领导干部在运动中深入实际，联系群众，解决问题，贯彻了从群众中来到群众中去，一般号召和具体指导相结合的原则。因此，许多单位在经济上也取得了巨大成果，超额地完成了今年国家的1、2月份计划。
    总结指出：目前增产节约运动还存在不少问题，主要是保守思想在阻碍运动的深入发展。具体表现在不少单位忽视和不注意发动群众，不重视政治思想工作，看不到运动中的积极因素，不积极不主动，畏缩不前，消极等待；有些单位发扬民主坚持民主制度不够，群众的民主生活和民主权力常常得不到应有的尊重，阻碍了群众的积极性与国家主人翁责任感的发挥；有的单位对提高质量与计划要求充分可靠有片面理解；有的存在本位主义，缺乏整体观念；并有满足现状的骄傲情绪。宣传工作中的片面性、表面性、形式主义、不求实效以及在组织领导方面的一些问题，都有待解决。
    针对上述情况，市委对下一步增产节约运动的要求是：全面加强政治思想工作，充分发动群众，广泛深入展开增产节约运动。为了达到这个总的要求，市委希望各单位注意以下几项具体要求：发动群众制定、修订和讨论增产节约指标，作到既先进又可靠。凡是已制定出指标的，必须充分发动群众讨论修订，组织群众实现指标；凡是没有订出的应该发动群众制定；凡是增产节约和国家计划能分开计算的应分开计算。同时各单位要订出精简机构、紧缩编制的方案。指标、方案都必须本着既先进又可靠可行的原则来制定。必须坚持开展先进生产者（先进工作者）运动和爱国增产运动，力争全面超额完成国家计划和增产节约的各项要求。在工厂企业中，应广泛开展劳动竞赛，签订集体合同，作好评比工作；作好工程技术人员和职员的发动工作；作好技术排队工作与原材料排队工作；在运动中要注意先进的和落后的，更要重视普通生产者的工作。
    总结着重指出，各级领导在增产节约运动中，仍应把全面加强政治思想工作放在首要地位。政治思想工作是一切工作的生命线，是增产节约运动全面、深入、健康发展的保证。
