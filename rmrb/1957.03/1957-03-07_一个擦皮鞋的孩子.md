A Shoe-Shining Boy
Li Pingming

During the Spring Festival, I returned to my hometown to visit relatives and passed through Nanjing, where I stayed in a hotel. Early one morning, I was awakened by the sound of "Shoe shine!" After getting up, I saw a young boy shining a woman's shoes in the hallway. This boy had a pair of bright, clever eyes, a fair complexion, and was dressed warmly and neatly. On his feet were a pair of nearly new black "Hercules" brand shoes. The boy's movements were agile and precise, looking like a veteran shoe-shiner.

At such a young age, he had already taken on the burden of life, running around in the winter morning. My heart felt heavy. How wonderful it would be to help him! After the woman paid him, I placed my shoes on the small wooden box and sat down. Once seated, I felt annoyed at my own naivety. In reality, how much could shining one or two more pairs of shoes solve for the child? As he shined, a strong desire to understand the boy's background compelled me to strike up a conversation:

"How old are you this year?"

"Thirteen." If he were in school, he would almost be graduating from elementary school, I thought silently.

"Do you have a big family?"

"Dad, Mom, and two younger sisters." He didn't slow down his work while answering.

"Does your dad work?" I continued to ask.

"He's a worker."

"Is life at home very difficult?"

He raised his head, and I saw a look of searching for something in his large eyes. When he saw me smile, he lowered his head again and, while applying shoe polish, said, "It's alright."

"Then why aren't you in school?"

"I'm in sixth grade." His voice carried pride.

Suddenly, my previously tense heartstrings relaxed. What a lovely child! I understood: he was using his labor during the holidays to prepare for the next semester's tuition!

"You must have good grades in school, right?" I asked with confidence.

"Five points in language, and five points in arithmetic." He answered contentedly.

"Are you good at reciting the multiplication table?"

"Yes!"

I deliberately wanted to challenge him, so I asked in reverse order: "Seven times six?"

"Forty-two."

"Nine times seven?"

"Sixty-three." He answered correctly without hesitation.

"What is multiplication?" I wanted to find some theoretical questions to stump him.

"A simplified calculation of adding several identical numbers together."

"How are fractions formed?" I asked further.

"By dividing something into several equal parts, then taking one or several of those parts..."

"Very good." I praised him without letting him finish.

There was no need to test him further, but thinking about the current situation where not all elementary school graduates can go on to middle school, I asked, "What if you don't get into middle school in the summer?"

He tapped the small wooden box, as if he had been prepared for this, and said, "I'll shine shoes while studying at home, and then take the exam again next year."

"What if you don't get in next year either?"

"That won't happen." He said confidently, as he packed the brushes and shoe polish into the wooden box, but immediately added, "I'm too young to participate in production labor, so if I don't get in next year, I'll take it the year after."

He put the small wooden box on his back.

"Thank you, little friend." I stood up, paid him, put my hand on his head, and escorted him to the front door. He looked up at me and smiled, nodded, and then walked down the steps in front of the door.

Welcoming him was a fiery red rising sun in the east.

    一个擦皮鞋的孩子
    李平明
    春节时回乡探亲，路过南京，投宿在一家旅馆里。一清早，被“擦皮鞋”声叫醒。起身后，在穿堂里看到一个男小孩正在给一个妇女擦皮鞋。这孩子有一对机灵的大眼睛，白净面皮，衣服穿得也还暖和、整洁，脚下踏着一双大半新的黑力士鞋。孩子的操作，敏捷而又正确，看上去像是一个擦皮鞋的老手。
    小小的年纪就肩起了生活的担子，在这冬日的清晨里满街跑了，一时心里沉甸甸的。要能帮助他一下多好！等那位女同志付了钱，我就把皮鞋搁在小木箱上坐了下来。坐定之后，很生气自己的幼稚，其实多擦一、两双皮鞋又能给孩子解决什么问题呢？擦着，擦着，一股想弄明白这孩子的身世的强烈心情迫使我和他攀谈起来：
    “你今年多大了？”
    “十三岁。”要是读书就快要小学毕业了，我默默地想着。
    “家里人很多吗？”
    “爸爸、妈妈，还有两个小妹妹。”回答问话时他并没有放慢自己的工作。
    “爸爸做事情吗？”我接着问。
    “做工。”
    “家里生活很困难吧？”
    他抬起头来，我看到大眼睛里流露出一种探索什么的神情。等到看见我笑了一下，才又低下头去一面涂鞋油一面说：“还过得去。”
    “那你为什么不上学呢？”
    “六年级了。”声音带有骄傲。
    一下子，我原来绷得很紧的心弦，突然松弛了下来。多么可爱的孩子呵！我明白了：他是在假期里，用自己的劳动，准备下学期的学费哩！
    “在学校成绩一定很好吧？”我很有把握地问。
    “语文五分，算术也五分。”他满意地回答着。
    “九九歌背得很熟了？”
    “嗯！”
    我有心想难他一下，故意颠倒着问：“七、六？”
    “四十二。”
    “九、七？”
    “六十三。”他并未打顿就答对了。
    “什么叫做乘法？”我想找些理论性的问题来难他。
    “几个相同数连加的简便算法。”
    “分数是怎样形成的？”我进一步问下去。
    “把一个东西分成若干等份，再取其中的一份或几份……”
    “非常好。”没让他说完我就夸奖他说。
    没有再考下去的必要了，但我想到目前小学毕业还不能百分之百升中学的这种情况，就又问道：“要是暑假考不上中学怎办呢？”
    他敲了敲小木箱，好像早有准备似地说：“一面擦皮鞋，一面在家自修，明年再考。”
    “要是明年再考不上呢？”
    “不会的。”他满有信心地说，一面把刷子、鞋油装进木箱里，但立刻又补上一句：“年龄小又不能参加生产劳动，明年考不上就后年再考。”
    他把小木箱背了起来。
    “谢谢你，小朋友。”我站起来，付了钱，把手放在他的头上，一直送他到大门口。他仰起头来向我笑了笑，又点了一下头，就走下门前的台阶。
    迎接着他的，正是东方一轮火红的朝阳。
