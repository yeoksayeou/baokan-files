Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 30th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's personal envoy, Rissho University President Masashige Matsushita, and three others, flew to London today to request the British government to halt hydrogen bomb tests on Christmas Island.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 30th: TASS, London, March 29th: The "World News" weekly published letters exchanged between the Japanese and British Communist Parties regarding the issue of stopping hydrogen bomb tests.

The letter from the Japanese Communist Party stated that the British ruling group's plan to test hydrogen bombs in the Pacific region deeply disturbed the Japanese people. The Japanese Communist Party requested the British Communist Party to "continue to strive and strengthen cooperation between the two parties as in the past, to eliminate the threat of atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and war, to ease international tensions, and to establish world peace."

The British Communist Party Executive Committee's reply expressed solidarity with the Japanese people. The reply said, "We guarantee to mobilize the British people to rise up and fight for an immediate ban on tests on Christmas Island and for a complete ban on all atomic weapons."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 30th: Professor Yoshitaro Hirano, Secretary-General of the Japan Peace Committee and Standing Committee Member of the World Peace Council, in an interview with the "Neues Deutschland" newspaper on the 28th, emphasized the necessity for the people of Germany and Japan to jointly oppose the stationing of foreign atomic troops.

Yoshitaro Hirano said: "West Germany and Japan are both occupied countries, both are highly developed industrialized countries, and both West Germany and Japan are being used as bases for preparations for launching an atomic war. Due to the seriousness of the situation, both countries are at a crossroads and bear a high degree of responsibility not only for themselves but also for world peace."

Yoshitaro Hirano arrived in Berlin on the 28th to attend the upcoming meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council in Berlin.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 30th: Koichi Uda, Chairman of the Japanese Atomic Energy Commission, said on the 29th that the Japanese government decided at a cabinet meeting on the morning of the 29th that it would not only sign atomic energy agreements with the United States and Britain, but also negotiate atomic energy agreements with the Soviet Union, Canada, and other European countries in order to promote Japan's peaceful use of atomic energy.

Japan has already concluded an atomic energy agreement with the United States, and the two sides are currently discussing revising the agreement. Uda said that the United States' postponement of the delivery of the revised draft of the Japan-U.S. atomic energy agreement would affect the Japanese Diet's discussion of the amendment.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 30th: Sundarlal, Vice-Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, issued a statement on behalf of the organization, saying that the All-India Peace Council "calls on the Indian Parliament and government to demand that the United Kingdom government abandon its planned nuclear weapons tests on Christmas Island."

The statement welcomed the Soviet proposal to cease nuclear explosion tests and once again requested the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union "to reach an agreement as soon as possible on the immediate cessation of all nuclear explosion tests and the absolute prohibition of the use of all nuclear weapons."

Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, March 30th: Erich Ollenhauer, Chairman of the West German Social Democratic Party, said on March 29th that the West German army should not be equipped with nuclear weapons. Possessing such weapons would greatly increase the danger threatening West Germany because it would not promote the easing of tensions but would instead exacerbate the situation.

Ollenhauer stated at a press conference that he supported the Soviet proposal to immediately conclude an agreement on the cessation of hydrogen bomb tests. He also advocated reaching an international agreement on general disarmament and the limitation of conventional armaments. He said that West Germany should not talk about how to strengthen its arms but should vigorously support all efforts to reduce armaments.
