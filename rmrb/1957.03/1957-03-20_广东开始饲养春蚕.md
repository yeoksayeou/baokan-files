    Guangdong Begins Raising Spring Silkworms

    (Reported by this newspaper) Guangdong Province, which has the earliest silkworm production season in China, has begun raising its first batch of spring silkworms. These days, the spring sun is warm, and silkworm eggs are hatching one after another. The silkworm farmers on both sides of the Pearl River Delta, which accounts for about 80% of the province's cocoon production, are busy collecting ant larvae, feeding mulberry leaves, preparing silkworm rearing tools, and disinfecting silkworm rearing rooms to welcome the birth of the silkworms. Many agricultural cooperatives in Shunde, Nanhai, Zhongshan, and other counties have also established silkworm and mulberry technical research committees, and are holding training classes on accelerating hatching, preparing to promote the Soviet Union's rapid silkworm rearing method, and carrying out various technical reforms in silkworm rearing to increase the cocoon production per silkworm egg card. The province plans to produce more than 200,000 dan of cocoons this year, an increase of 23.8% over last year. Among them, the first batch of spring silkworms is being raised with eight thousand more cards than in the same period last year, and it is estimated that at least three thousand dan more white cocoons can be produced.

    广东开始饲养春蚕
    本报讯　我国蚕造生产季节最早的广东省，第一造春蚕已开始饲养。这几天，春日融融，蚕卵陆续孵化。占全省产茧量八成左右的珠江三角洲两岸的蚕农们，正紧张地收蚁给桑，准备蚕具，进行蚕房消毒，迎接蚕儿的诞生。顺德、南海、中山等县许多农业社，还成立了蚕桑技术研究委员会，举办催青训练班，准备推广苏联快速育蚕法，进行养蚕的各项技术改革，以提高每单张蚕种产茧量。这个省今年产茧量计划达到二十多万担，比去年增加23.8％。其中第一造春蚕，比去年同期多养了八千张，预计至少可增产白茧三千担。　（肖俊城）
