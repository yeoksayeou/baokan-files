Low Plans Are Discouraging
By our reporter Shang Kai

Editor's Note: Currently, the production targets in the production plans formulated by many agricultural cooperatives in various regions are too low. Corresponding to this situation, the measures to increase production in the plans are vague and weak. When these cooperative leaders were overcoming the shortcomings of the excessively high production targets in the production plans set at the beginning of last year, they went to another extreme. They believed that lowering the production targets would make the cooperative members happy in the autumn for overfulfilling the plan, and could avoid being passive because they failed to complete the plan. The actual situation is that the cooperative members are not satisfied with the low plans, but instead suppress their enthusiasm for production; as a result, they become passive right away. The Yuci County Party Committee paid attention to helping grassroots cadres overcome conservative ideas and revise production plans, which was the right thing to do. Other places should also pay close attention to this issue. However, the practice of "busily convening meetings of cadres at the county, township, and cooperative levels" for this purpose in various counties of the Yuci Special District is not necessarily the best approach. At present, there are still some areas where spring plowing activities are languishing due to too many meetings and activities, with township and cooperative cadres and model workers staying at the top for meetings for a long time. This situation also deserves attention. Overcoming conservative ideas and revising production plans can be carried out in a decentralized manner in various townships and cooperatives. This can avoid delaying current production activities, and can directly promote current production activities, can more directly mobilize the masses and inspire the masses, and can also use the opinions and activities of the masses to more powerfully educate cadres.

The spring plowing season has arrived on both sides of the Fen River.

Currently, the counties in the Yuci Special District of Shanxi Province are busy convening meetings of cadres at the county, township, and cooperative levels. The central topic of the meetings is to discuss the annual production plan and comprehensively deploy spring plowing. At these meetings, the focus of the debate is no longer whether agricultural cooperatives have superiority, but rather: Can 1957 really be a year of harvest? Is it better to set the production plan higher, or lower?

At the Yuci County three-level cadre meeting, the conservative ideas and negative emotions of some cadres were concentratedly exposed. Cadres in townships and cooperatives that suffered disasters and reduced production last year emphasized insufficient funds, poor livestock, low morale of the masses, and difficulty in carrying out production well. Cadres in townships and cooperatives that achieved bumper harvests last year believed that last year was a good year that occurred once in a decade, and that all the forces of nature, land, manpower, and finance had been exhausted, and that this year could not compare with last year in any way. Therefore, the plans formulated by many agricultural cooperatives remained at the level of normal annual output (i.e., "three fixed" output), and some even lower than normal annual output. For example, the production plan of the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Dongyang Township this year was reduced by 300,000 jin of grain compared to last year. The actual yield of Dubao Agricultural Cooperative last year was 203 jin per mu, and the planned yield per mu this year is 190 jin.

Where does this conservative thinking come from? The main source is the failure to see or fully see the favorable conditions for agricultural production this year, and the overemphasis on unfavorable conditions. Therefore, the most effective way to overcome the conservative ideas of grassroots cadres is to guide everyone to find and summarize the favorable conditions for agricultural production this year. This is what the Yuci County Party Committee did. They asked the 1,300 cadres attending the meeting: "Are there more difficult conditions for agricultural production this year? Or are there more favorable conditions?" They asked everyone to discuss this topic. After full discussion and comparison, everyone agreed that although agricultural production this year has certain difficulties, this year has more favorable conditions than last year. The main ones are:

	First, the vast number of grassroots cadres have gained experience in leading cooperative large-scale production through a year of work last year, and they are clear-minded. In particular, after the party rectification and the rectification of the cooperatives, the relationship between cadres and the masses has been further strengthened, and 94% of the cooperative cadres have been re-elected this year.

	Second, after streamlining the upper levels and sending cadres down, the grassroots leadership has been strengthened. A total of seven county-level cadres, eighteen district-level leading cadres, and forty-four general cadres have been sent down to the county. In addition, five county cadres and forty-eight township cadres have returned to leadership positions in the cooperatives.

	Third, last winter, through party rectification and the rectification of cooperatives and summarizing the production achievements of the first year of cooperation, extensive publicity and education on the superiority of cooperation was carried out, and the morale of the masses was full. In winter production and preparation for plowing, the attendance rate of male labor force often remained above 90%. Fertilizers, feed, and fuel are also well prepared, and the quality is higher than last year.

	Fourth, the economic conditions of agricultural cooperatives this year are better than last year. Last year, when they had just been transformed into advanced cooperatives, they all felt that there was a shortage of cash, seeds, feed, and farm implements. This year, all cooperatives have accumulated relatively abundant funds, and the county has increased by more than 1,000 double-furrow plows, more than 300 rubber-tired carts, and many fat livestock.

	Fifth, many wells and canals newly built last year were not used due to rain and floods; this year, some more water conservancy projects have been added, which can greatly play a role. In addition, the land has been leveled, the stubble has been adjusted, and the seeds have been purified. These are all favorable conditions for agricultural production this year.

After discussion, everyone admitted that as long as they are good at using the positive factors and favorable conditions in all aspects to overcome unfavorable factors and possible difficulties, they are confident in striving for a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year.

Some people proposed: We now set the plan low, and in the autumn the grain production will increase greatly. Will the masses not be more satisfied? So that we don't set the plan too high and fail to reach it like last year, causing the masses to complain, making ourselves miserable, and leaving the cooperative leaders in a very passive position. Many people agreed with this statement.

Everyone then launched a discussion on this issue. The cadres of the Chenkan Agricultural Cooperative forcefully refuted this statement. They said: When we set the plan, the cooperative cadres all said that it would be better to set it lower. After announcing it to the cooperative members, the cooperative members reflected: "Last year there was no hope, and this year there is still no hope." The cooperative cadres had to revise it again according to the opinions of the cooperative members, and in the end they still ended up in a passive position. The situation in the Guocun Agricultural Cooperative was also the same. When the cooperative members were discussing the draft production plan, they said: "Last year we tried our best and still couldn't reach it, and this year we can rest for half a year and still have those harvests." What a sharp criticism of conservative thinking! Finally, a consensus was reached. It is certainly not good to set the plan too high, and it is equally not good to set it too low. A plan that is too low will not only fail to encourage everyone to move forward, but will also discourage everyone. Therefore, many agricultural cooperatives that originally had low plans have appropriately revised their plans. On average, the county has exceeded the normal annual output by 17.4% (the average planned output per mu was 203 jin, and now the planned output per mu is 237 jin). The Yuci County Party Committee believes that this indicator is both advanced and reliable.

The situation in other counties in the Yuci Special District is roughly the same as that in Yuci County; currently, agricultural cooperatives in various counties are revising their production plans.

    计划偏低，令人泄气
    本报记者  商恺
    编者按  目前各地许多农业社制订的生产计划中，产量指标偏低；和这种情况相应的是计划中的增产措施笼统、无力。这些社的领导人员在克服去年年初订的生产计划的产量指标过高的缺点的时候，走向了另一极端。他们认为把产量指标降低就可以使社员到秋天为超额完成计划而高兴，可以免得使自己因完不成计划而被动。实际情况是：社员群众对偏低的计划并不满意，反而压抑了社员们的生产热情；于是，眼前就使得自己被动起来了。榆次县委注意了帮助基层干部克服保守思想、修订生产计划，做得很对。别的地方也应当密切注意这个问题。不过，榆次专区各县为此而“忙着召开县、乡、社三级干部会议”，这种做法却不一定都是最好的办法。目前仍然有些地区因会议活动太多，乡社干部和劳动模范很长时间留在上面开会，而使春耕活动消沉，这种情况也值得注意。克服保守思想、修订生产计划的事，可以分散在各乡各社进行；这样可以不误当前生产活动，而且可以直接推动当前生产活动，可以更直接地动员群众、鼓舞群众，也可以用群众的意见和活动更有力地教育干部。
    春耕季节已经来到汾河两岸。
    目前，山西省榆次专区各县正在忙着召开县、乡、社三级干部会议。会议的中心议题是讨论全年生产计划，全面部署春耕。在这些会议上，争论的中心已经不是农业社有没有优越性的问题，而是：1957年究竟能不能丰收？生产计划定高一点好，还是低一点好？
    在榆次县三级干部会议上，集中地暴露了一部分干部的保守思想和消极情绪。去年受灾减产的乡和社的干部，强调资金不足，牲畜不好，群众情绪不高，生产很难搞好。去年获得丰产的乡和社的干部，则认为去年是十年不遇的好年景，天力、地力、人力、财力都使尽了，增产已经到了顶，今年怎么也比不过去年。因此，许多农业社制定的计划都停留在常年产量（即“三定”产量）的水平上，甚至有的还低于常年产量。像东阳乡虹光农业社今年的生产计划，就比去年降低了三十万斤粮食。杜堡农业社去年每亩实产二百零三斤，今年每亩计划产量是一百九十斤。
    这种保守思想是从哪里来的呢？主要来源是没有看到或者没有全面看到今年农业生产的有利条件，而过多地强调不利条件。既然如此，克服基层干部保守思想的最有效的办法就是引导大家寻找和总结今年农业生产的有利条件。中共榆次县委就是这样做的。他们向到会的一千三百名干部提出：“今年农业生产的困难条件多？还是有利条件多？”这样一个题目，让大家讨论。经过充分地讨论和比较，大家一致认为今年农业生产虽然有一定的困难，但是今年比去年有着更多的有利条件。主要是：
    一、广大基层干部经过去年一年工作的锻炼，摸着了领导合作化大生产的门路，心里亮堂了。特别是经过整党整社，干部和群众的关系进一步密切了，94％的社干部，今年都被连选连任。
    二、精简上层，干部下放以后，基层领导加强了。全县共下放县级干部七人，区级主要干部十八人，一般干部四十四人，此外还有五个县干部、四十八个乡干部回到了社的领导岗位上去。
    三、去年冬季通过整党整社和总结合作化第一年的生产成绩，广泛进行了合作化优越性的宣传教育，群众情绪饱满，在冬季生产和备耕工作中，男劳动力出勤率经常保持在90％以上。肥料、饲料、燃料也都准备的比较充分，质量比去年高。
    四、今年农业社的经济条件比去年优越。去年刚刚转成高级社，都感到现金、种子、饲料、农具不足。今年各社都积累了比较充裕的资金，全县增加了一千多部双铧犁、三百多辆胶轮大车、许多肥壮的牲畜。
    五、去年新修的许多水井水渠等，因雨涝没有使用；今年又增加了一些水利工程，可以大大发挥作用。此外，土地平整了，茬子调开了，种子纯洁了，这都是今年农业生产的有利条件。
    经过讨论，大家承认，只要善于运用各方面的积极因素和有利条件，去克服不利因素和可能出现的困难，争取今年农业生产大丰收是有把握的。
    有人提出：我们现在把计划定得低低的，秋天粮食增产的多多的，群众不是会更满意吗？免得像去年一样把计划定的过高而达不到，弄得群众埋怨，自己苦恼，社的领导落得非常被动。许多人都同意这样的说法。
    大家又就这个问题展开了讨论。陈侃农业社的干部有力地反驳了这种说法。他们说：我们定计划的时候，社干部都说定低点好；等到向社员宣布以后，社员们反映：“去年是没希望，今年还是没指望。”社干部只得再根据社员的意见进行修改，结果还是落了个被动。郭村农业社的情况也是如此，社员们在讨论生产计划草案的时候说： “去年是努死力也达不到，今年是歇上半年也能有那些收成。”这是对保守思想多么尖锐的批评啊！最后，得出了一致的结论。计划定的过高了固然不好，定的低了也同样不好。偏低的计划不但不能鼓舞大家前进，还会使大家泄气。于是，许多原来计划偏低的农业社，都适当地修订了计划。全县综合起来，超过常年产量的17.4％（每亩平均定产是二百零三斤，现在计划每亩产二百三十七斤）。榆次县委认为这个指标是既先进又可靠的。
    榆次专区其它各县的情况，同榆次县大体相同；目前，各县的农业社都在修订生产计划。
