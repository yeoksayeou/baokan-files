Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 2nd. "People's Freedom Daily" published on February 28th the resolution on current problems and tasks passed by the Provisional Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party on February 26th. The resolution is divided into the following six parts: Party building, unity of socialist forces, state administration and work of state power organs, economic work, work of mass organizations, and international relations of the party. The resolution first stated that in the process of resolutely fighting against counter-revolutionaries, significant achievements have been made in political, economic, and cultural life, as well as in the development of the party and mass organizations, due to the implementation of the Party's December Resolution.

	I. Party Building
	The first part of the resolution – Party Building – states that the party, the leading force of people's democracy and the dictatorship of the proletariat, is developing basically healthily and at a satisfactory speed. The number of party members is increasing by an average of 8,000 to 12,000 per week. The total number of party members has now exceeded 190,000. In addition to urban party organizations, party organizations have also been established in 75% of rural areas. The number of party grassroots organizations has exceeded 8,000.
	The Party Central Committee's newspaper, "People's Freedom Daily," has a daily circulation of 620,000 copies on weekdays and 690,000 copies on Sundays. Individual subscriptions reach 250,000.
	The general characteristics of gatherings organized by the party are the large number of participants, heated, free, principled, and constructive discussions, and a spirit full of combativeness and unity.
	The resolution states that the reason we have been able to develop the party in a healthy way is primarily because we have clearly drawn a line between ourselves and the anti-party group of Imre Nagy and Losonczy, and resolutely and irreconcilably struggled against all those who attempted to restore harmful policies within the party, policies that ultimately served counter-revolutionary purposes.
	We also repelled the counter-revolution's attack on our party under the false banners of "Stalinism," "Rakosiism," etc.
	The achievements in party building are also due to the Party Central Committee's resolute opposition to dangerous sectarian policies. In order to overcome this danger, we meticulously selected members of the leadership organs and took effective measures to realize intra-party democracy.
	The resolution states that because our policy is based on principles and resolutely implemented in practical work, we have ensured the party's unity in principle, politics, and organization; at the same time, we have achieved the gradual effective leadership role of the party in the national and social life of Hungary.
	The resolution then discussed some shortcomings in party building, mainly in the following aspects: some party members adopt a closed-door attitude towards intellectuals and workers' councils; some party members hold sectarian views towards former members of the Working People's Party who have not yet joined the party; in some places, there is a non-comradely attitude of finding fault with everyone; and the central leadership of the party organizational system is weak, etc. The resolution states that we must establish enthusiastic, comradely, and friendly relations with the original members of the Working People's Party who have not yet joined the party. Members of the Socialist Workers' Party and most of the original members of the Working People's Party are related in the long-term and remarkably effective struggle for the victory of socialism.
	The Central Committee decided: 1. To establish the Secretariat of the Central Committee; 2. To re-establish the Central Supervisory Committee; 3. To resume the planned training of cadres; 4. To establish a party school with a term of six months; 5. To re-publish the party's theoretical journal "Social Review"; 6. To organize various report meetings to clarify major theoretical issues; 7. To prepare to convene a national party congress in a few months to discuss the party's situation and tasks, strengthen and finally determine the party's leadership organs.

	II. Unity of Socialist Forces
	The second part of the resolution talks about the unity of socialist forces. The resolution states that in addition to party building, all socialist forces have made significant progress in their initiative and unity in the struggle against the counter-revolution. In order to victoriously and completely achieve this goal, the struggle began in a very complex political situation and has not yet ended.
	In thoroughly and completely eliminating the counter-revolutionary forces, the resolute and forceful application of the means of the dictatorship of the proletariat is absolutely necessary, but this is not enough. In addition to suppression, it is also necessary to ideologically and politically expose and isolate the counter-revolution.
	The resolution states that the ideological confusion of certain strata of the working masses and the paralysis of the party and socialist forces were primarily caused by the anti-Marxist revisionist views of Nagy and others, which are in fact a denial of the bourgeois nationalism of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Nagy and others, with their revisionist views, joined forces with the imperialist bourgeoisie, acted as the vanguard of the counter-revolution before October 23, and played the role of the rearguard after the turning point of November 4.
	The reason why the unity of socialist forces has made relatively smooth and rapid progress in the past two and a half months is that the party has publicly opposed the revisionist views represented by the Nagy group in front of the masses and has held high the banner of Marxist-Leninist proletarian dictatorship and proletarian internationalism, which they betrayed.
	In terms of the assessment of recent events, a unity in principle and politics has formed in the organizations of the Socialist Workers' Party, the party members have gradually seen the betrayal of the Nagy-Losonczy group more clearly, and they all believe that the prerequisite for future smooth development is to thoroughly eliminate the anti-Marxist views of this group. The resolution states that whether we can liberate the deceived working classes from the ideological and political influence of the counter-revolution will depend on the extent to which we complete this task.
	In order to finally eradicate counter-revolutionary ideas, and to eradicate anti-party, anti-working class and anti-Soviet views ("nationalism", neutralism, etc.), the party needs to continue to carry out ideological work and political mobilization conscientiously. In order to speed up this process, activist meetings, open party days, etc. should continue to be held.

	III. Work of State Administrative Departments
	The third part of the resolution – Work of State Administration and State Power Organs – states that the government has achieved great success in the normalization of national life in the past two and a half months. The social order and social security that were once destroyed by counter-revolutionaries have been restored, and transportation and production have also gradually returned to normal. The work of the administrative departments has also made great progress. As a result of all this, the leadership of the government organizations and parliamentary management departments and its prestige among the people have been consolidated.
	While taking resolute administrative measures against the counter-revolution, the administrative departments have also conscientiously carried out the work of overcoming bureaucracy. Some of the central ministries have been merged, the number of staff in the central organs has been reduced by 45%, the state and district councils have been reduced by 40%, and the number of staff in the township councils has increased by 4,500. Due to the resolute measures taken against the counter-revolution and the gradual overcoming of bureaucracy, the dictatorship of the proletariat has been strengthened, guaranteeing the development of socialist democracy.
	The Central Committee believes that the state administrative departments should strengthen the government's leadership role in their work, so that the Council of Ministers and state organs at all levels can effectively solve the various tasks of normalizing national life. The consolidation of national life has reached such a degree that, in addition to the state administrative organs carrying out their work, it is also necessary to begin the regular constitutional activities of the state power organs.
	Subsequently, the resolution put forward measures to improve the work of state administration and state power organs, including: strengthening the leadership of state organs; strengthening education and culture, state planning and administrative leadership, internal affairs and judicial work; developing the work of workers' self-defense forces in various places, so that they become a powerful force against counter-revolutionary attacks, defending the worker-peasant state, the socialist system and the people's property; carrying out the work of parliament and people's congresses in various places, and carrying out various activities of the Patriotic People's Front. The Socialist Workers' Party attaches great importance to the Patriotic People's Front as a united front of the party and patriotic people outside the party, and believes that it occupies an appropriate position in the political life of the country.

	IV. Economic Work
	The fourth part of the resolution talks about economic work. The resolution believes that the recovery of economic life is a decisive achievement made by the Hungarian people under the leadership of the party and the government.
	The resolution points out that, in this regard, in addition to their own efforts, the assistance of fraternal countries has played a great role. In particular, the Soviet people have shouldered most of the economic assistance. As of February 1, Hungary had received assistance worth 700 million forints from fraternal countries, and another 200 million forints worth of assistance is on its way. In addition, socialist countries have provided support that is even greater than the amount of free assistance.
	The Central Committee points out that the measures taken by the Executive Committee and the Council of Ministers to restore production and economic life in industry, agriculture, transportation and commerce, as proven by practice, are generally correct.
	In addition to our achievements, we should also see our shortcomings. When we have not yet begun to solve the problems that have already caused a heavy burden in the past, new difficulties have emerged. The production cost of industry has greatly increased compared with before the events, partly due to reasonable wage increases, but mainly due to other reasons, such as slack labor discipline, unjustified cancellation of the wage system based on task completion, decline in task completion figures, and poor utilization of production capacity. Therefore, the state's income from industry has decreased much more than in the past, and due to the relaxation of state discipline, the number of residents paying taxes has also declined. These shortcomings must be overcome quickly in order to rationally use the massive assistance of fraternal countries, constantly maintain the balance between purchasing power and commodity reserves, the balance of the budget and the balance of foreign trade, so as to avoid our people suffering from possible inflation.
	Only under these indispensable conditions can we start with all our strength to reorganize the national economic production mechanism, decentralize economic leadership and improve and eliminate our backward state in technology compared to advanced industrial countries, and strive for our most important goal - further and continuously improving the living standards of the working people and improving their living environment.
	The resolution believes that the main tasks in the economic field at present are: to correctly apply the principles of the socialist wage system, consolidate labor discipline, and rationally organize production to ensure the improvement of labor productivity and the rapid reduction of production costs; strict tax discipline; in addition to implementing the principles of socialist planned economy, economic leadership should be decentralized, and on the other hand, it is also necessary to ensure that the workers' committees play a supporting role in leadership; it is necessary to start formulating a new five-year plan based on the country's conditions and guaranteeing correct proportions, and to implement it from January 1, 1958. In some sectors of the national economy, longer-term ten- to fifteen-year plans should also be drawn up; in order to ensure the development of agricultural production and the supply to residents, methods should be formulated to develop national free procurement and rational production accordingly. Taking into account the public interest, the agricultural price system should stimulate production sentiment; in order to promote the development of agricultural production, especially in the socialist direction, the party and the government will give due support to the workers of state farms and production cooperatives so that they can develop their economy; an agricultural program should be drawn up as soon as possible to ensure that agriculture develops in the right direction.
	The Party Central Committee agrees with the measures taken by the government so far on wage issues, and believes that the wages of workers in many other sectors, especially technical intellectuals and teachers, should also be adjusted, but at the same time, the stability of the forint's value must be maintained.

		V. Work of Mass Organizations
	The fifth part of the resolution talks about the work of mass organizations. The resolution believes that it is necessary to establish multifaceted connections with the masses through various mass organizations. The important tasks in this regard are: in the political fortress of the working class, in factories, mines, and state farms, communists must use political guidance to make party organizations, trade unions, and workers' committees complement each other, but at the same time be able to work independently; in terms of relations with trade unions, this organization of the working class should be made a solid pillar of the working class. The influence of right-leaning social democrats who oppose the unity of the working class and undermine the unity of the working class must be eliminated; in terms of relations with workers' committees, the remnants of alien and hostile political influences that are still playing a role in the workers' committees must be terminated, but on the other hand, the incorrect policy of holding a sectarian closed-door attitude towards workers' committees in some places should also be combated. It should be recognized that if the activities of workers' committees are carried out according to the situation in Hungary, then the workers' committees can become a powerful weapon and can provide assistance in fighting bureaucracy, in improving production levels, in reducing production costs, and in improving productivity; in order to avoid dual leadership in production, a method should be found so that party organizations only manage the most important issues in production, and the supervision of detailed issues in production is indirectly realized through workers' committees; conscious working women should have corresponding representation in all aspects of national life and play an active role; a central issue of the party's political work, at present and especially in the future, is to conduct ideological and political education for young people, as well as to care about the present and future problems of young people. In order to educate a new generation of communists with a Marxist-Leninist worldview, and also to provide a comprehensive political guidance organization for the youth movement split into various hierarchical organizations, a communist youth organization must be established. The solution of this task should be regarded as a major issue in the Hungarian communist movement, and after considerable preparation, it should be discussed at a meeting convened by the Party Central Committee for this issue; relying on the excellent traditions of the Young Pioneers movement, eliminating the formal, superfluous, and often harmful practices of the past in this regard; the Central Committee calls on party members to shoulder the work and tasks in mass organizations entrusted by the masses. In order for the party to work better in mass organizations, party groups should be established.

	VI. International Relations of the Party
	The sixth part of the resolution – on the Party's international relations – states that the internationalist camp of socialist countries, communist parties, and workers' parties, led by the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, supports our party, government, working class, and people with all their strength in their struggle to defend the Hungarian socialist revolution and the cause of national independence. Our party has also successfully developed and strengthened international relations in the spirit of proletarian internationalism since the Party Central Committee's December Plenary Session.
	The Party recently participated in a number of important international meetings. In all these talks, the principle of equality between fraternal parties was realized, and consensus was reached on all major issues in the international workers' movement. All fraternal parties supported our struggle against the counter-revolution. We believe that these talks have also promoted the further strengthening of the socialist camp.
	The Party Central Committee approves the measures and decisions taken by the Executive Committee in international talks, and approves the various agreements signed by our party's representatives.
	The Party Central Committee also regrets that, while we have normal inter-state relations with Yugoslavia, there are essential differences between the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party's position and the publicly stated position of some leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia on some important issues, such as party unity and the assessment of the so-called "district workers' committees" in Hungary. However, we hope that our differences can be clarified within the scope of comradely discussion.
	The resolution concludes by saying that, in order to improve the party's ideological level from the perspective of Hungarian national interests, the Central Committee believes that the issue of educating party members in the spirit of patriotism and proletarian internationalism, as well as the issue of further strengthening international relations, are very important. To this end, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party now and in the future will advocate and be forever prepared to participate in all meetings and support any actions aimed at strengthening proletarian internationalism.

    关于匈牙利当前的问题和任务
    匈牙利社会主义工人党临时中央全会通过决议
    新华社布达佩斯2日电  “人民自由报”2月28日刊载了匈牙利社会主义工人党临时中央委员会2月26日全体会议通过的关于当前的问题和任务的决议。这个决议共分为下列六部分：党的建设，社会主义力量的团结，国家行政管理和国家权力机关的工作，经济工作，群众组织工作，党的国际联系。决议首先说，在同反革命分子进行坚决斗争的过程中，由于执行了党的十二月决议，在政治、经济和文化生活方面以及发展党和群众组织方面都取得了重大的成就。
      一、党的建设
    决议的第一部分——党的建设说，党——人民民主和无产阶级专政的领导力量——的建设正在基本上健康地以令人满意的速度发展。党员人数平均每周增加八千到一万二千人。目前党员总数已经超过十九万人。除城市的党组织以外，在75％的乡村中也建立了党的组织。党基层组织的数目已经超过八千个。
    党中央机关报“人民自由报”平日每天发行六十二万份，星期日发行六十九万份。个人订户达到二十五万。
    党所组织的集会的一般特点是参加的人数众多，是热烈、自由、有原则的和建设性的讨论，并且充满战斗的和团结一致的精神。
    决议说，我们之所以能够使党得到健康的发展，首先是因为同伊姆雷·纳吉和洛松齐反党集团明确地划清了界线，同一切试图在党内恢复归根到底是为反革命目的服务的有害政策的人进行了坚决的和不调和的斗争。
    我们也击退了反革命以“斯大林主义”、“拉科西主义”等虚伪口号向我们党所发动的进攻。
    党的建设上的成就也是由于党中央委员会坚决反对危险的宗派主义政策。为了克服这种危险，我们缜密地选出了领导机构的成员，采取了有效措施来实现党内民主。
    决议说，由于我们的政策是建立在原则的基础上的，在实际工作上又得到了坚决的贯彻，因此我们就保证了党在原则上、政治上和组织上的统一；同时也达到了使党在匈牙利的国家、社会生活中逐渐起着有效的领导作用。
    决议接着谈到了党的建设中的一些缺点，在这方面主要是：某些党员对知识分子和工人委员会抱关门主义的态度；一些党员对那些到现在还没有入党的前劳动人民党党员持有宗派主义的观点；某些地方出现有一种非同志式的在一切人身上寻找错误的态度；党组织系统的中央领导不强等。决议说，我们要同至今还未入党的原来的劳动人民党党员建立热心的、同志式的友好关系。社会主义工人党党员和劳动人民党的大部分原来的党员都是在为争取社会主义胜利而进行的长期而卓著成效的斗争中有联带的关系。
    中央委员会决定：一、成立中央委员会书记处；二、重新建立中央监察委员会；三、恢复有计划地培养干部的工作；四、建立六个月为一期的党校；五、重新出版党的理论杂志“社会评论”；六、组织各种报告会以澄清主要的理论性问题；七、准备在几个月内召开全国党代表会议，以讨论党的情况和任务，加强并最后确定党的领导机构。
      二、社会主义力量的团结
    决议的第二部分谈到社会主义力量的团结。决议说，除了党的建设以外；社会主义的所有力量在对反革命进行斗争的积极性和团结方面都有了重大的进展，为了胜利地、全部地实现这个目标，斗争是在很复杂的政治形势中开始的，而且还没有结束。
    在彻底全部消灭反革命势力方面，坚决有力地运用无产阶级专政的手段是完全必要的，但是，这还是不够的，除了镇压以外，还需要在思想上、政治上揭露和孤立反革命。
    决议说，劳动群众的某些阶层的思想混乱、党和社会主义力量的瘫痪，首先是由纳吉等人的反马克思主义的修正主义的、实际上是否定无产阶级专政的资产阶级民族主义的观点所造成的。纳吉等人以其修正主义的观点与帝国主义资产阶级结合成了一条战线，在10月23日以前担任了反革命的前哨，11月4日转折点以后，又担任了后卫的角色。
    社会主义力量的团结在过去两个半月中所以得到了比较顺利和迅速的进展，是因为党在群众面前公开地反对了纳吉集团所代表的修正主义的观点和高高地举起了为他们所背叛的马克思列宁主义无产阶级专政和无产阶级国际主义的旗帜。
    在对于最近事件的估价方面，社会主义工人党的组织中形成了原则上和政治上的统一，党员群众对纳吉—洛松齐集团的背叛行为逐渐看得更清楚了，都认为今后顺利发展的先决条件是彻底消除这个集团的反马克思主义的观点。决议说，我们能否从反革命的思想、政治影响下把被欺骗的劳动阶层解放出来，将以我们完成这一任务的程度如何为转移。
    为了最终铲除反革命思想，铲除反党、反工人阶级和反苏的观点（“民族主义”、中立主义等），需要党继续认真地进行思想工作和政治鼓动。为了加速这一过程，应当继续举行积极分子会议、公开的党日等。
    三、国家行政管理部门的工作
    决议的第三部分——国家行政管理和国家权力机关的工作说，政府在过去两个半月中在国家生活的正常化方面获得很大成绩，曾经一度被反革命分子破坏的社会秩序和社会安全得到了恢复，交通和生产也相继正常进行。行政部门的工作也有很大的进展。由于这一切，政府组织和议会管理部门的领导工作和它在人民中的威信得到了巩固。
    对反革命采取坚决行政措施的同时，行政管理部门也认真地进行了克服官僚主义的工作。中央各部一部分进行了合并，中央机关职员人数已裁减45％，州区议会裁减40％，乡议会工作人员增加了四千五百人。由于对反革命采取了坚决措施，并逐步克服官僚主义，无产阶级专政加强了，保证了社会主义民主的发展。
    中央委员会认为，国家行政部门在工作中应加强政府的领导作用，使部长会议和各级国家机关能有效地解决国家生活正规化的各种任务。国家生活的巩固已达到这样的程度，即除国家行政管理机关进行工作外，还需要开始国家政权机关的正规的合乎宪法的活动。
    随后，决议提出了关于改进国家行政管理和国家权力机关工作的措施，其中包括：加强国家机关的领导；加强教育和文化、国家计划和行政领导、内政和司法工作；发展各地工人自卫队的工作，使它们成为反对反革命进攻、保卫工农国家、社会主义制度和人民财产的强大力量；开展议会和各地人民会议的工作，开展爱国人民阵线的各种活动。社会主义工人党十分重视作为党和党外爱国人士团结联合的爱国人民阵线，并认为它在国家政治生活中占有适当的地位。
    四、经济工作方面
    决议的第四部分谈到经济工作问题。决议认为，经济生活的恢复是匈牙利人民在党和政府的领导下所获得的有决定意义的成就。
    决议指出，在这方面，除了自己的努力外，兄弟国家的援助起了很大的作用。特别是苏联人民担负了大部分的经济援助。到2月1日为止，匈牙利已经得到了兄弟国家七亿福林的援助，另外还有二亿福林价值的援助正在运输途中。此外，社会主义国家还给予了比无偿援助数目更大的支持。
    中央委员会指出，执行委员会和部长会议为了恢复生产和经济生活，在工业、农业、交通和商业方面所采取的党和政府的措施，经过实践证明一般是正确的。
    除了我们的成就外，还应看到我们的缺点，当我们还未能开始解决过去已经造成沉重负担的问题时，新的困难又出现了，工业的生产成本与事件以前比较大大增加了，这有一部分是由于合理的工资提高，但主要是其他原因造成的，如劳动纪律松弛、没有理由地取消了按照完成任务情况发工资的制度、完成任务的数字下落、生产能力发挥得很不好，因此国家从工业方面得到的收入比过去减少了很多，而且由于国家纪律的松弛，居民的纳税数字也下落了。必须赶快克服这些缺点，以便合理使用兄弟国家的大量援助，经常保持购买力与货物贮备间的平衡，预算的平衡和对外贸易的平衡，从而使我国人民避免遭受可能发生的通货膨胀。
    只有在这些不可能缺少的条件下，我们才能以全力开始进行国民经济生产机构的改组，经济领导的分权和改善消除我们在技术上比先进的工业国落后的状态，为我们的最主要的目标——进一步不断提高劳动人民的生活水平和改善他们的生活环境而奋斗。
    决议认为在经济方面当前的主要任务是：正确地运用社会主义工资制度原则，巩固劳动纪律，合理组织生产以保证劳动生产率的提高和生产成本的迅速降低；严格纳税纪律；除了实行社会主义计划经济原则外，应该实现经济领导的分权，另一方面还要保证工人委员会在领导方面起辅助作用；必须着手制订以本国条件为基础并保证有着正确的比例的新的五年计划，从1958年1月1日开始执行，在某些国民经济部门还应拟制更长期的十—十五年的计划；为保证农业生产的发展及居民的供应，应制订相应发展国家自由收购和合理生产的方法，在考虑到公共利益的情况下，应使农业价格制度刺激生产情绪；为了促进农业生产的发展，特别是向社会主义方向发展，党和政府将给予国营农场的劳动者以及生产合作社以应有的支持，以便他们能发展其经济；应当尽早订出农业纲领，以保证农业朝正确方向发展。
    党中央同意政府迄今在工资问题上所采取的措施，认为还应当调整其他很多部门的劳动者特别是技术知识分子和教员的工资，但同时还必须保持福林价值的稳定性。
        五、群众组织工作方面
    决议的第五部分谈到群众组织工作。决议认为必须通过各种群众组织同群众建立多方面的联系。在这方面的重要任务是：在工人阶级的政治堡垒，在工厂、矿山和国营农场中，共产党人要通过政治指导使得党组织、工会和工人委员会相辅相成，但同时又能独立地进行工作；在和工会的关系方面，要使工人阶级的这个组织成为工人阶级巩固的支柱。必须消除反对工人阶级团结、破坏工人阶级团结的右倾社会民主党人的影响；在和工人委员会的关系上，终止在工人委员会中仍起作用的异己的、敌对的政治影响残余，但另一方面也应该和某些地方表现出来的对工人委员会持宗派关门态度的不正确政策进行斗争，应该认识到，如果按照匈牙利的情况来开展工人委员会的活动，那工人委员会就能成一个有力的武器，就能在和官僚主义进行斗争、在提高生产水平、在降低生产成本、在提高生产率方面给予帮助；为了避免生产中进行双重领导，应该找到一种方法使得党的组织只管生产中一些最重要的问题，对于生产中细节问题的监督则间接地通过工人委员会来实现；使有觉悟的劳动妇女在国家生活的各方面有相应的代表，并起积极作用；党的政治工作的一个中心问题，目前是、今后尤其是对青年进行思想、政治教育，以及关心青年的现在和将来的问题，为了教育新的具有马克思列宁主义世界观的共产主义的一代，同时也为了使分裂成各阶层组织的青年运动有一个包括各方面的政治指导机构，必须建立一个共产主义的青年组织，应该把这个任务的解决看成是匈牙利共产主义运动中的一个重大问题，并且在经过相当准备后应在党中央为此问题而召集的会议上进行讨论；依靠少先队运动中优秀的传统，消除过去这方面的实际工作中形式的、多余的、而且往往是有害的作法；中央委员会号召党员们在群众的委托下担负群众组织中的工作和任务。为了使在群众组织中工作的党工作得更好，应成立党组。
    六、党的国际联系
    决议的第六部分——关于党的国际联系说，以苏联和苏联共产党为领导力量的各社会主义国家、共产党和工人党的国际主义阵营，用全部力量支持着我们党、政府、我国工人阶级和我国人民为保卫匈牙利社会主义革命和民族独立事业而进行的斗争。我们党在党中央十二月全会后也以无产阶级国际主义精神顺利地发展和加强了国际联系。
    党最近参加了一些重要的国际会晤，在所有这些会谈中，都实现了各兄弟党之间平等的原则，在国际工人运动所有主要问题上都达成了一致，各兄弟党都支持我们向反革命所作的斗争。我们认为，这些会谈也促进了社会主义阵营的进一步加强。
    党中央赞同执委会在国际会谈中所采取的措施和决定，并批准我们党的代表所签订的各项协定。
    党中央同时遗憾地认为，我们和南斯拉夫有着正常的国家间的关系的同时，在一些重要的问题上，例如在党的团结和估计匈牙利的所谓“区工人委员会”问题上，匈牙利社会主义工人党的立场和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟一些领导者的公开表明的立场之间，却有着本质上的分歧，但我们希望我们的分歧能在同志式的讨论范围内得到澄清。
    决议最后说，为了提高党从匈牙利国家利益的观点出发的思想水平，中央委员会认为，用爱国主义和无产阶级的国际主义精神教育党员的问题，以及进一步加强国际联系的问题，是非常重要的。为了这一点，匈牙利社会主义工人党现在和将来都要倡导和永远准备参加一切会见，支持一切旨在加强无产阶级国际主义的任何行动。
