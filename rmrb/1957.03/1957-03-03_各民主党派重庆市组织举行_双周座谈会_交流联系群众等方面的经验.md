Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, March 1st: The local organizations of various democratic parties in Chongqing recently held a "bi-weekly symposium" to exchange their main experiences in their work in 1956 and help each other improve their work this year.

Chongqing established a "bi-weekly symposium" system in 1952, in which the United Front Department convened representatives of democratic parties and people's organizations every two weeks to hold symposiums to discuss current affairs and policies, negotiate work, and exchange experiences. This system was not well maintained later and was interrupted for a year and a half until it was resumed in January this year.

At a recent symposium, representatives of the local organizations of various democratic parties in Chongqing exchanged experiences in contacting the masses and developing organizations. The members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (RCCK) extensively carried out social liaison work in 1956, with more than 790 former Kuomintang military and government personnel and social figures frequently contacted. The RCCK Chongqing Municipal Committee organized them to study current affairs and policies, visit factories, rural areas, and construction sites, and used these methods to contact them and help them improve their ideological awareness. More than 200 of them participated in the literacy campaigns in residential sections, and more than 40 were rated as excellent teachers by the masses. A representative of the RCCK Chongqing Municipal Committee said that the large number of people they contacted was mainly due to mobilizing and relying on all members to work together. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL) and the Chongqing Branch Committee of the Jiusan Society invited the masses they contacted to participate in various symposiums and report meetings last year. They also adopted methods such as members being assigned to maintain fixed contact with certain masses to unite and contact many people. The CDL's organizations at all levels also used special investigation methods in universities to collect opinions from CDL members and the masses, providing them to the CCP party organizations for reference to improve their work. A representative of the Chongqing Branch Committee of the Jiusan Society introduced their experience in helping members and the masses learn. They often collected reference materials on scientific research, teaching reform, current affairs, and policies, and distributed them to members and non-member masses, which was very popular.

Representatives of the various democratic parties also discussed their organizational development based on contacting the masses last year. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party (CPWDP) originally had poor contact with the medical and health fields. Last year, with the help of the CCP party organization, they changed this situation and did a lot of mass work in the medical and health fields. Based on this, they have now developed many new members. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA) mobilized its members to actively participate in the upsurge of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce last year, cultivated and expanded the ranks of leading figures in industrial and commercial circles, and absorbed a large number of leading figures into the organization. By the end of last year, their membership had doubled compared to the beginning of the year. Some representatives of democratic parties pointed out in their review that while developing the organization, the education of new members and the leadership of grassroots organizations had not been able to keep up in a timely manner, so some grassroots organizations are not yet sound enough.

During the exchange, the local organizations of the various democratic parties in Chongqing also talked about their preliminary plans for this year's work. All the democratic parties have listed further improving the work of contacting the masses and the education of members as important work content for this year. The RCCK Chongqing Municipal Committee plans to contact 2,000 to 2,500 social figures this year and, based on the weak links in last year's work, decided to strengthen the political and ideological work of grassroots organizations and the development of the organization this year. The CDNCA Chongqing Municipal Committee decided to further establish and improve grassroots organizations, earnestly urge members to participate in various studies, and encourage them to participate in the increase production and practice economy movement in various units.

    各民主党派重庆市组织举行“双周座谈会”
    交流联系群众等方面的经验
    新华社重庆1日电  各民主党派在重庆市的地方组织在最近举行的一次“双周座谈会”上，交流了他们在1956年工作中的主要经验，相互帮助改进今年的各项工作。
    重庆市在1952年开始建立“双周座谈会”制度，由统战部门召集各民主党派、人民团体代表每两周举行一次座谈会，讨论时事政策、协商工作和交流经验。这一制度后来没有很好坚持，中断了一年半时间，直到今年1月间才又开始恢复。
    在最近一次座谈会上，各民主党派重庆市地方组织的代表交流了他们在联系群众和发展组织等方面的经验。民革的成员在1956年广泛开展了社会联系工作，经常有联系的原国民党军政人员和社会人士达七百九十多人。民革重庆市委员会组织他们学习时事政策，参观工厂、农村和建筑工地，通过这些方法同他们联系，帮助他们提高思想觉悟，其中已有二百多人参加了居民段的扫盲活动，还有四十多人被群众评为优秀教师。民革重庆市委员会的代表说，他们联系的人数这么多，主要是由于发动和依靠全体成员一起动手。民盟重庆市委员会和九三学社重庆分社委员会，去年通过召开各种座谈会、报告会，邀请所联系的群众参加；并采取由成员分工固定联系一定群众等办法，团结和联系了许多群众。民盟的各级组织还在高等学校中采用专题调查的办法，搜集盟员和群众的各种意见，提供中共党组织参考用来改进工作。九三学社重庆分社委员会的代表在会上介绍了他们帮助成员和群众学习的经验。他们经常汇集有关科学研究、教学改革、当前时事政策等方面的参考资料，印发给成员和社外群众，很受欢迎。
    各民主党派的代表在会上还谈到了他们去年在联系群众的基础上发展组织的情况。农工民主党重庆市委员会原来对医药卫生界的联系很差，去年他们在中共党组织的帮助下改变了这种情况，在医药卫生界做了不少群众工作，在这个基础上现在已经发展了不少新成员。民主建国会重庆市委员会去年发动成员积极投入资本主义工商业社会主义改造高潮，培养和扩大了工商界骨干分子的队伍，并吸收大批骨干分子参加了会的组织。到去年年底，他们的成员已比年初增加了两倍。有些民主党派的代表检查出，在发展组织的同时，由于对新成员的教育和对基层的领导工作没有能够及时赶上去，因此目前有的基层组织还不够健全。
    各民主党派重庆市地方组织在交谈中，也谈到了他们对今年各项工作的初步规划。各民主党派都把进一步做好联系群众的工作以及成员的教育工作列为今年的重要工作内容。民革重庆市委员会计划今年联系社会人士两千人到两千五百人，并根据去年工作中的薄弱环节，决定今年加强对基层组织的政治思想工作和发展组织的工作。民主建国会重庆市委员会决定进一步建立和健全基层组织，认真督促会员参加各种学习，鼓励他们参加各个单位的增产节约运动。
