I listened to Chairman Mao's twelve instructions and the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. I express my extreme joy, agree with and support them, and ask myself to study hard in order to conform to and implement the Party and government's various guidelines and policies. In order to contribute my limited knowledge to socialist construction, I fully express my heartfelt support for Vice Premier Li's statement about combining large, medium, and small-scale water conservancy projects, and his point that small-scale water conservancy projects are both economical and time-saving. At the same time, I feel it is my responsibility to propose improvements to Hebei's water conservancy plan. Thanks to the inspection system of the past few years, which has provided us with many conveniences in research and learning, and has increased our knowledge, I am able to write this suggestion. I express my sincere gratitude to the central leadership for the inspections and to the cadres and masses of various provinces and cities for their assistance. Now, in addition to submitting the written proposal, I should explain the reasons for the suggestions:

Since the liberation of our country, the brilliant achievements in water conservancy construction have been praised both at home and abroad, and cannot be fully described in a short time. The government will have further plans in the second five-year national economic plan, which meets the common requirements of the people. Hebei's floods not only affect the lives of the local people, but also have a direct and close relationship with the completion of the national economic plan. For example, Hebei's cotton production accounts for 40% of the country's cotton production, but for several years, it has failed to meet the production targets due to flooding. In 1956 alone, the reduction in cotton production due to waterlogging was 300 million jin of ginned cotton, which is equivalent to 770,000 bales of yarn, or the annual output of seven to eight State-owned Cotton Mill No. 2, which is also equivalent to 770,000 spindles lacking production materials for one year. Furthermore, the reduction in grain production of 5 billion jin requires the central government to allocate a large amount of grain for supply; this requires the allocation of a large number of vehicles for round-trip transportation; as well as relief funds; exemption from agricultural taxes; consumption of medical and epidemic prevention; traffic obstruction; the plight of industry and commerce; and the poor lives of the affected farmers. These are all direct losses in the national economy. As for indirect losses, local culture, education, administration, and justice are all affected by floods, at least delaying the improvement and progress of their work achievements. There are many examples to prove this. This is sufficient to prove the importance of its relationship to the national economic plan. Although the area is limited to one province, the leadership, approval, and all support for the water conservancy plan are in the hands of the central government. I have repeatedly raised my opinions in Hebei Province, but the decision on the issue lies with the central government. I should again submit to the central government "Suggestions for Improving Hebei's Water Conservancy Plan":

    I. Research and analyze the situation and causes of floods in Hebei.
    (1) In Hebei Province, waterlogging has been more serious than river flooding over the years. The figures for flooding and waterlogging in various years are listed below:
        1949 Total flooded area: 33 million mu
         River flooding accounted for one-third
         Waterlogging accounted for two-thirds
        1950 Flooded area: 17 million mu
         River flooding: 7.88 million mu
         Waterlogging: 9.12 million mu
        1951 Total flooded area: 4,980,717 mu
         River flooding: 470,504 mu
         Waterlogging: 4,510,213 mu
        1952 Total flooded area: 1.08 million mu
         River flooding: 832,000 mu
         Waterlogging: 248,000 mu
        1953 Total flooded area: 29,789,430 mu
         River flooding: Over 5.44 million mu
         Waterlogging: Over 24.34 million mu
        1954 Total flooded area: 39,657,011 mu
         River flooding: 14,723,101 mu
         Waterlogging: 24,933,910 mu
        1955 Total flooded area: 17,695,421 mu
         River flooding: 7,058,548 mu
         Waterlogging: 10,636,873 mu
        1956 Total flooded area: 45 million mu
         River flooding accounted for one-third
         Waterlogging accounted for two-thirds
    Judging from the above figures for flooding and waterlogging over eight years, only two years were relatively dry (1951 and 1952) with less rainfall. There was only one year in which the figure for river flooding was higher than that for waterlogging. In the other seven years, the figure for waterlogging far exceeded that for river flooding. This shows that if we want to control floods in Hebei, we cannot eliminate most of the waterlogging disasters by simply solving mountain floods and river flooding. The reason is very clear.

    However, before 1954, Hebei's water conservancy work only focused on mountain floods and river channels, and even then, it did not solve most of the mountain floods and river channel disasters. Of course, a lot of manpower and water conservancy funds were used, and there were some partial achievements. However, the distance to solving river flooding is still far, and no attention has been paid to eliminating waterlogging. Therefore, Hebei's floods have become more and more serious year after year.
    (2) The main causes of the disaster.
    After each major flood, people often say: This year's rainfall is particularly heavy, which is an irresistible natural disaster. Under this language, people can excuse the responsibility of those who lead water conservancy work, and at the same time, they do not study the gains and losses of water conservancy work. But we are fortunate to be in an era of socialism that emphasizes truth, and we need to study the main causes of disasters in order to clarify the key to solving problems.
    The Yanshan, Taihang, and Hengshan mountains in Hebei are barren for thousands of miles. In July and August, rainfall is concentrated, mountain floods burst, river defenses collapse, and waterlogging overflows, with no place to accommodate and discharge it, resulting in drowning of people and animals and destruction of houses. From the perspective of natural phenomena, although it is a natural disaster, it is a natural disaster that can be overcome. In fact, it is because human efforts have not been exhausted that it has become a disaster. Comparing Jiangnan with Hebei will give a clear picture.
    In 1954, the average rainfall in Hunan Province was over 2,000 mm, such as 2,200 mm in Ningxiang County; while the average rainfall in Hebei that year was 812 mm, which is one and a half times less than that in Hunan. However, the flooded area in Hebei that year was 39.65 million mu, which is three times more than the flooded area in Hunan. Why is the difference so big? This is only because there are many ponds, dams, ditches, and canals in Hunan, which can store a large amount of rainwater, while there are very few ditches, canals, ponds, and dams in Hebei Province. Once heavy rain comes, it can only be allowed to flood into disaster. Therefore, the disaster of rainfall can be overcome, but the failure to pay attention to water conservancy plans is the main reason why floods cannot be overcome.

    The party and government cadres and masses in Hebei counties have made their best efforts in flood prevention, drainage, and water conservancy construction, and even struggled hard and blocked water with their bodies. There are many touching stories. However, serious disasters still strike year after year. The reason for this is not the party and government cadres and masses, but that the water conservancy plan has not hit the actual key points.
    Marx said that Egypt developed water conservancy technology due to the floods of the Nile. Lenin once instructed that studying and analyzing the laws of nature, controlling them, and utilizing them can turn water hazards into water conservancy. Since the socialist construction of our country, all departments have welcomed rationalization proposals. However, due to the ideological rejection of rationalization proposals by a few people, the floods that could have been eliminated earlier have become more and more serious year after year, resulting in huge losses to the national economy. This is indeed an important reason for causing disasters, and it is urgent to review it, strengthen the improvement of water conservancy plans, and implement them.
    II. There are various opinions on preventing and controlling floods in Hebei.
    (1) Dredging rivers and building dikes.
    (2) Reconstructing Ningjinbo, Daluze, and old river channels and ditches.
    (3) Afforestation in the upper reaches to conserve water and soil.
    (4) Waiting for the construction of large reservoirs.
    (5) Transforming low-lying areas.
    (6) Changing to rice cultivation.
    (7) Ditch-furrowed fields and soil-ridge fields.
    The above seven methods of preventing and controlling floods in Hebei all have partial reasons. Some must be adopted, some can be carried out in parallel without contradiction, and some cannot be implemented. However, none of them is the most critical way to fundamentally control floods in Hebei. The reasons are detailed separately.
    III. An outline of my specific suggestions for improving Hebei's water conservancy plan.
    (1) Small-scale water conservancy projects should be built in coordination with large reservoirs in the national plan and the planning of various river basins, in order to comprehensively eliminate drought and flood disasters and more smoothly carry out socialist construction.
    (2) In the upper reaches, mountainous areas (including mountainous areas in neighboring provinces at the source of the river), and hilly areas, more small reservoirs and ponds, as well as gully dams and various soil and water conservation projects, should be built to store mountain floods, reduce river flooding, and irrigate high-lying fields.
    (3) In the middle reaches, flat areas should be developed with a combination of ditches, canals, ponds, and ditch-furrowed fields to eliminate waterlogging, and ponds for storing rainwater to facilitate irrigation.
    (4) In the lower reaches, flat areas should be developed with ditches and ponds, low-lying areas should be developed with terraced fields and the construction of embankments, and in waterlogged areas and narrow and dangerous confluence points of rivers, reduced rivers should be opened or the existing reduced rivers should be widened and deepened.
    (5) In low-lying alkaline areas, terraced fields should be developed or converted into rice paddies to wash away alkali and prevent waterlogging (both the middle and lower reaches have low-lying alkaline areas).
    (6) Wells, springs, small reservoirs, ditches, and ponds should be used in combination to eliminate drought.
    (7) Water conservancy is closely related to afforestation. It is necessary to plan the zoning of seedling cultivation and gradually carry it out to facilitate soil and water conservation and complete the greening of mountainous areas as soon as possible.
    The above seven opinions are based on the evidence of examples seen in repeated inspections and the suggestions and speeches repeatedly made to the province and the central government over the past four years, which are quite in line with the facts. Now, they have been comprehensively整理(zhěnglǐ - put in order) into the above seven opinions. If they are adopted and implemented, they must be adapted to local conditions and to the times. I also made a suggestive speech on this opinion at the Hebei Provincial People's Congress in late October 1956, but I do not yet know whether it has been adopted. I am now submitting it again. The reasons for each opinion and its important significance will be discussed in more detail later.
    IV. The benefits of building small reservoirs and ponds.
    Some people say that large reservoirs can play a role, or that small reservoirs can be built along rivers, but not in other places. I think large reservoirs are indeed effective, but they are expensive, take a long time, and cannot completely solve mountain floods. Also, if they are only built on rivers, they occupy a small area and have limited water storage. If more small reservoirs are built along mountainous and hilly areas, especially when the national economy has not yet developed to a high degree, building more small reservoirs is not only economical, but also can store a large amount of water. This can not only reduce soil erosion in mountainous areas and reduce floods entering the river, avoiding waterlogging in the downstream; but also reduce the threat of drought in mountainous areas. Therefore, I suggest building a large number of small reservoirs.
    According to what I have seen in inspections of various provinces, the construction cost of small reservoirs and ponds is very low, the construction time is very short, and no steel materials are required. Only local manpower is used, and the beneficiaries provide labor, which everyone is happy to do. In order to solve the problems of their own interests, the masses can understand. This is a method that is fast, comprehensive, good, and economical.

    For example, Ningxiang cadres said: The county already has 54,890 ponds, 73 newly built small reservoirs, and 6,100 river dams. It is also planned to build a reservoir upstream of the Shahe River that can hold 2 million mu of rainfall. Liling cadres said that they have built 31,996 ponds, 1,801 irrigation canals, and 82 small reservoirs. Next year, they plan to build more than 100 new ponds and small reservoirs, and plan to destroy more than 1,000 mu of farmland as new pond sites. They also said that they have calculated the accounts clearly, and are willing to change a few fields into ponds and dikes to increase the yield of most fields, rather than lower the yield of most fields by being stingy with a few fields. They abandoned their conservative ideas, so they did not hesitate to sacrifice land for water conservancy. This answers the opposing opinions that ditches, canals, and ponds occupy land and reduce production.

    In the autumn of 1956, I asked how many small reservoirs had been newly built in Hebei. One said more than 70, and another said more than 400. I don't know who is correct, and it is possible that the 400+ includes mountain ponds. Comparing the water conservancy of a province with that of Ningxiang and Liling counties, the gains and losses can be judged immediately.
    Regarding the benefits of building ponds, in mountainous and hilly areas they are called mountain ponds, and in plains they are called plain ponds. The main purpose is to store waterlogging and reduce and prevent waterlogging disasters. Mountain ponds can play the role of flood control and irrigation; plain ponds can play the role of both storing and discharging water. In summer, when it rains continuously for days, water accumulates in the fields and the seedlings are easily withered and die. If some ponds are built to give the water a place to go, the waterlogging disaster can be avoided. As for the form and size, it can be adapted to local conditions. The ditches and canals are connected, and the storage and discharge are controlled, and they are combined with ditch-furrowed fields. The depth, distance, and distance are based on the standards of absorbing rainfall and ensuring the elimination of waterlogging. The land occupied by ditches and canals can be used to grow aquatic plants such as lotus, water chestnut, cattail, and reeds, and can be used to raise fish and ducks. Shelves can be built along the ditches and ponds, and all kinds of vines can be planted, such as loofah, winter melon, squash, wax gourd, bottle gourd, hyacinth bean, broad bean, grapes, and many vine medicinal herbs such as Trichosanthes kirilowii and morning glory. A professor from an agricultural college said: The production of ponds is higher than that of dry land, which also answers the land occupation problem. At the same time, it can also reduce the rapid flow of floods into the river, so as not to submerge downstream areas, and solve downstream disasters. This is something that benefits both upstream and downstream, and it is also a common obligation to eliminate floods. Ditches and ponds can also conserve underground water sources, and can also increase the sources of well water and springs in longer periods of drought. Therefore, it is said that ditches and ponds are a good way to ensure increased production.

    According to Vice Premier Deng Zihui's report, more than 27,000 small reservoirs and 3.8 million ponds, dams, and canals were built nationwide last year. Hebei Province's cultivated land area accounts for more than one-thirteenth of the country's total cultivated land area, but only 400+ small reservoirs (including mountain ponds) were built last year, which is very few compared to other provinces. Without facilities to accommodate rainwater, how can waterlogging not occur?
 V. The following are answers to various opinions against improvement.
    When I put forward my suggestions for improving Hebei's water conservancy in the winter of 1953 and the spring of 1954, I was very grateful to the comrades in charge of Hebei's water conservancy work for putting forward many opposing opinions, so that I could know where the problems were and could further study and prove them. Over the past few years, I have gained a lot of strong evidence in inspections and readings, and I can know what is right and wrong. Due to time constraints, I can only briefly answer them as follows:
    (1) Land occupation problem. Opponents say: Ditches, canals, and ponds occupy a lot of farmland, which will reduce production.
    This question has already been answered in the previous item. The land occupied is about 5% to 8%, and the land guaranteed to be free from floods accounts for about 92% or more, which is obviously a clear distinction between gains and losses compared to the majority of farmland being affected by disasters. If the groundwater level is low, dig deeper and occupy less land; if the groundwater level is high, dig shallower and occupy more land; if it is the shallowest, store water and change to rice cultivation, increasing production. Moreover, ditches and ponds can be used to increase production. In addition to the production in the ponds and along the ditches, waterlogging disasters can be avoided and the yield of farmland can be increased, ensuring a bumper harvest. Looking at the production situation in various provinces in Jiangnan can be a clear proof. If we only worry about the land occupied by ditches and ponds, and do not consider the serious damage caused by floods that is ten times greater than the land occupied, we will only allow waterlogging disasters to肆肆猖狂(sì sì chāng kuáng - run rampant) year after year. Now the number of waterlogged areas accounts for 35% of the total cultivated land area. We can know what is right and wrong.
    (2) Obstacles to mechanized farming. Some people say: Fields with ditches and ponds hinder mechanized farming and hinder industrialization.
    In the winter of 1954, I inspected the mechanized farming distance in Ninghe State Farm, and I also inquired in detail about the mechanized farming distance at the Lutai Tractor Station. Last November, I went to Shuangqiao Farm in Eastern Beijing and inquired in detail about the number of turns in mechanized farming and the difference in reducing cultivation speed. It can be proved that ditches and ponds do not have a great obstacle to the speed of mechanized farming. Although there is a very slight delay in cultivation time when turning around, the effect of ditches and ponds protecting mechanized farming is greater than the loss caused by delaying time and reducing cultivation speed, possibly dozens of times greater. Shuangqiao Mechanized Farming Farm has suffered serious flood losses for many years. The severity of the gains and losses can be judged.

    The "Dete 54" tractor at Shuangqiao Farm, with the same tillage depth of 22 cm (about 7 inches) and with a tine harrow, harrowing the land once, in different length sections, the shift workload is as follows:
    Section length 1,000 meters, width 100 meters Shift workload (10 hours) 87 mu
    Section length 500 meters, width 50 meters Shift workload 85 mu
    Section length 300 meters, width 50 meters Shift workload 82 mu
    From this table, calculated on a monthly basis, the second type is only 60 mu less, which is less than one day's workload; the third type is only 150 mu less, which is less than two days' workload. In fact, the mutual distance between ditches and ponds is very small in the third type of short distance. If there are no ditches and ponds to eliminate floods, the loss of mechanized farming effect is equal to wasting most of the mechanized farming equipment.

    (3) Some people say that a comprehensive improvement of water conservancy must wait for ten years of measurement.
    This statement has been cancelled by itself in the promotion of ditch-furrowed fields and soil-ridge fields. However, ditch-furrowed fields and soil-ridge fields cannot completely solve the problem. Methods that cannot solve the problem can be promoted immediately, while methods that can guarantee to solve the problem must be postponed for ten years. How can this be explained?
    Originally, the old farmers knew the height of the water flow in the countryside. They may know where the water flows in their village, so why measure it for ten years? This is a lie.
    (4) Some people say that improving comprehensive water conservancy and building small reservoirs, ditches, and ponds requires the state to pay a large amount of funds.
    Small-scale water conservancy projects are either jointly run by the people and the government, or run by the people themselves. It is right for the masses to contribute their own labor in order to obtain a bumper harvest of their own crops. This is the case in various provinces in Jiangnan. Although it can be jointly run by the people and the government, it can also lead the people to run it themselves, and should not use the excuse of needing the state to pay a large amount of funds to not mobilize the people to run it themselves.
    (5) People may not be willing to contribute labor for ditches and ponds; the masses may not agree.
    In recent years, the people have paid a lot of labor every year for flood prevention work, but as a result, they still suffer from disasters every year, wasting a lot of manpower. The people in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have paid a lot of labor to build water conservancy projects. Last spring, each person in Jiangning, Hanjiang, and Kunshan counties paid 50 to 60 workdays, and they all achieved bumper harvests. In the rainy season of 1954, the people of Xinle County in Hebei Province dug a lot of temporary ponds and ditches, preserving a considerable harvest. At the Provincial People's Congress in the spring of 1955, the representative of Ding County proposed to try out ponds and ditches in the county to eliminate floods, but it was not approved. This shows that it is not that the masses do not want to improve, but that those in charge of water conservancy work do not agree. Also, in the winter of 1955, the Boyan Township Cooperative in Wu'an County told me that their cooperative had dug a pond of 7.3 mu to store water for planting 10,000 mu of cotton fields. This proves the masses' demand for improving water conservancy.
    (6) Some people say that the soil dug out of the ditches and ponds cannot be spread out.
    The improvement of water conservancy plans should be divided into steps, with construction starting in three to five years, digging and spreading soil in stages. With less soil and more fields, it is easy to spread thinly and cultivate twice. The new and old are evenly mixed. The old farmers said: "New soil and old soil,打石(dǎ shí - load) five, (meaning more harvest)," but some people believe that it is impossible to spread the soil, which is more difficult than clearing the trenches of Shangganling.
    (7) Some people say that it is impossible to construct in winter because it is freezing, and in spring because it is busy.
    This statement should have been awakened by the high tide of agricultural cooperativization. From the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956, it was the season when it was freezing in winter and busy in spring, and many water conservancy projects were built in various places.
    (8) Some people say that ditch water generates alkali and alkalizes good land.
    This issue has been answered in the speeches of Representative Xu Kai and my speech at the Third National People's Congress. Digging ditches to the right size not only does not generate alkali, but also can wash away alkali and gradually eliminate alkalinity.
    (9) Some people say that water conservancy construction is a long-term work, possibly 30 or 50 years, and cannot be expected to have quick results.
    This statement may be true for the construction of large rivers, large rivers, and large reservoirs. However, the Agricultural Development Program has stipulated that drought and flood disasters will be basically eliminated within twelve years. Especially the people of Hebei, who are drowning and starving, are unwilling to wait so long. That is because they cannot think of a way to eliminate floods in the short term, so they say this. If they are willing to adopt the seven opinions, floods can be basically eliminated in three to five years. This is based on evidence.
    (10) Some people say that it is impossible to have a comprehensive and systematic plan for water conservancy construction.
    There were many water conservancy disputes in Hebei Province in 1956, and the disasters were aggravated because there was no comprehensive plan and the upstream and downstream did not take care of each other, resulting in the lack of a systematic organization for construction.
    (11) Some people say that pond water leaks and cannot be used for irrigation and fish farming.
    This is the case in areas with white soil and sandy soil, but this area accounts for a very small area in Hebei. Although ponds in this area cannot be used for fish farming and irrigation, they can always be used to消纳沥潦灾害(xiāo nà lì lǎo zāi hài - absorb the waterlogging disasters). It is better than not having ponds, which causes water to accumulate in the fields and drown the crops. This is to give priority to preventing waterlogging, while drought prevention and fish farming are secondary. Although it cannot be used for fish farming, other aquatic crops can still be planted. Moreover, leaking ponds can also be transformed.

    Ponds with loess and clay soil are not easy to seep, or there may be some seepage in the first and second years, but after three years, they will not seep. Or, they can be rolled with stones several times, or compacted with夯(hāng - a heavy hammer), and they will not seep.
    I saw the Gengshang Township Cooperative near Wugong Village in Raoyang County using several water pits on the edge of the village to raise fish. According to the cooperative cadres, each water pit raised thousands of fish, each of which grew to more than one jin, which is more profitable than farming. This shows that most areas of Hebei are suitable for digging ponds and ditches.
    (12) Pond water easily evaporates, making it inconvenient to use for irrigation.
    Those who say this should know that according to the monthly water evaporation table of Hebei, a pond that is six or seven feet deep, filled with water in August and September, can still have about three feet of water depth in April of the following year, which can be used for spring irrigation to ensure the harvest of planting cotton and wheat season. If the pond is more than one zhang deep, there will be more water stored. This view also forgets the task of the pond, which is mainly to solve the waterlogging disaster, and secondly to prevent drought.
    The water tanks in Daxing County are exposed, and some people suggested building houses on the other side of the river to shade the sun and prevent evaporation. The responsible comrades in the county said that it would cost too much and could not be done temporarily. I said that it is only necessary to plant long-vined plants such as grape trellises along the shore to avoid evaporation and increase production. The comrades in the county happily accepted.
    (13) Some people say that ditches and ponds are only suitable for the south and cannot be applied in the north.
    "The Soviet Union passed a huge plan to transform nature on October 20, 1948, ... building 45,228 ponds and reservoirs in collective farms and state farms." "The Molotov Farm dug seven large ponds for raising fish and ducks." Hebei Province is south of the Soviet Union, so why is it not suitable? Ninghe also has water stations and ditches, rice fields, and Tongzhuan opened a large pond last year, which also played a role. There is a lot of rain in Hunan. On average, every 100 mu of farmland has at least 10 mu of ponds. Some areas have two or three mu of ponds for every 10 mu of farmland. There is less rain in Hebei. Although it does not need one-tenth of the ponds, it can have five mu of ponds and one mu of ditches for every 100 mu of farmland, or more or less, but there must be facilities for preventing waterlogging and storing water.

    Although there is less rainfall in the north, because it is concentrated in July and August, it forms a huge disaster. Small reservoirs and ditches must be used to disperse the water势(shuǐ shì - force) in order to ensure the elimination of floods. The reason is very clear. The reason why the disasters in the north are serious year after year and the people's lives are difficult is because the water conservancy viewpoint is behind the south.
    (14) What should I do if the water level is shallow when digging ponds and water comes out?
    When the water level is high, it is best to dig out spring water. When the water source is sufficient, change to rice cultivation, and the yield will be greater. For example, Daxing County has newly opened more than 10,000 mu of rice fields. Last year, in the waterlogging disaster, the rice fields yielded about 400 jin, and at the same time, they can消纳(xiāo nà - absorb) a part of the waterlogging. Mancheng County also has this example.
    (15) Small-scale water conservancy conflicts with river channel work; or say to repair river channels before digging ditches and ponds.
    Those who say this regard ditches and ponds as opposed to river channels; or regard river channels as the main ones, and small reservoirs, ditches, and ponds as the secondary ones. In item (1) of my seven opinions on improving water conservancy, "Small-scale water conservancy should be built in cooperation with large reservoirs in the national plan and the planning of various river basins." This has already stated that they are not opposed but cooperative and mutually assisting. Its cooperation and mutual assistance lie in regulating storage and discharge, dividing labor and cooperating, so as to eliminate drought and waterlogging disasters. County cadres said that we repair dikes every year, prevent floods every year, suffer from waterlogging every year, and provide disaster relief every year. Last year, more than 100 breaches occurred in various dikes. It can be seen that only dredging rivers and building dikes to ensure flow cannot solve the problem. Small reservoirs, ponds, and ditches must be built to store floods and reduce waterlogging, reducing the burden on the river channels. Naturally, the river will not漲溢(zhǎng yì - overflow), and the dikes will be免溃决(miǎn kuì jué - avoid breaching). But it is not to say that as long as small-scale water conservancy is built, the importance of annual river channel repairs should not be emphasized, but that large and small should be taken into account. It is also necessary to compile river basin plans as soon as possible, so that dry沟(gōu - ditches) can be connected with ponds, reservoirs,涵(hán - culverts), and闸(zhá - sluice gates),通贯(tōng guàn - running through) rivers, controlling the flow. But it is not to say that there must be basin plans before water conservancy can be built. For example, Jiangning County built many ponds and reservoirs last year, and it has already achieved increased production without waiting for the Qinhuai River to be reorganized. There are such examples in various provinces.

    Why is it easy to recognize the effectiveness of ditches, ponds, and small reservoirs in the south, but there are these opposing opinions in Hebei? This is a fresh suggestion in the history of water management in the north, and it may be because there is no chapter on this in water conservancy theory, it should not be surprising to encounter opposition. In particular, wanting to write ditches, ponds, and small reservoirs into a planned and systematic theory of eliminating floods is rarely seen in the water conservancy works of China for thousands of years; and no water conservancy scholars have been heard of having such a plan; although in fact many ditches, ponds,围(wéi - embankments), and库(kù - reservoirs) have been built in various provinces in the south, I went to Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Hunan provinces, and searched for relevant works of this kind, but did not find them. However, the Ministry of Water Conservancy did not express opposition to this suggestion to improve Hebei's water conservancy plan, and three water conservancy scholars in the ministry clearly expressed their agreement. In order to further clarify the reasons for the aforementioned seven improvement opinions, I put forward the following theoretical opinions on fundamentally controlling floods in Hebei in the winter of 1953:
    Local water management, dispersing water勢(shuǐ shì - force), storing for discharge, discharging for storage, taking into account both storage and discharge, benefiting both upstream and downstream. Comprehensive planning, adapting to local conditions, using疏导(shū dǎo - dredging) in parallel, drought and waterlogging can be saved.

    In 1956, Tongzhuan and Jinzhuan, Xingzhuan and Hanzhuan in Hebei Province had water conservancy disputes, and the reason was that they did not manage water locally and disperse water勢(shuǐ shì - force); because there was discharge without storage, it was unfavorable for both upstream and downstream; because there was no comprehensive planning, it could not play a role in dredging, causing serious disasters.

 VI. The necessity of improving Hebei's water conservancy plan.
    In the past four years, Hebei Province has flooded a total of 132,141,862 mu of farmland. In addition to the reduction in cotton and grain production, millions of houses have collapsed, and livestock and property have been washed away, etc. It is said that the various losses suffered by Hebei Province due to floods in the past four years have been around 10 billion yuan. Moreover, a lot of water conservancy funds are wasted every year, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs cannot but allocate a large amount of relief funds to help refugees, and the Ministry of Grain not only reduces income but must also allocate a large amount of grain for supply. The direct and indirect losses of various departments are not small numbers. The most concerning thing is the difficult lives of tens of millions of victims who eat糠咽菜(kāng yàn cài - eat chaff and wild herbs). The Geng Changgeng Socialist Cooperative, the banner of agricultural cooperativization in Hebei, accumulated a lot of fertilizer last year and 精耕细作(jīng gēng xì zuò - cultivated meticulously), and expected a large increase in production, but a flood reduced production by 70%, which had a serious impact on the cooperative's economy. This made me unable to help but think that if the leaders of water conservancy work had been willing to humbly consider and accept the suggestions for improving Hebei's water conservancy plan two or three years ago, the floods would definitely not have been so serious. This is not an empty dream, but can be proven.

    Evidence 1. After years of pressure from serious disasters and the opinions put forward by comrade cadres, there had to be some slight improvements. Mancheng started the experiment of ditch-furrowed fields in 1955, and small reservoirs were built and completed in 1956. It is said that Mancheng flooded more than 90,000 mu in 1954, 30,000 mu in 1955, and the rainfall last year was 900 mm, which was more than in previous years, but only more than 800 mu of farmland were flooded. This is clear evidence 1.
    Evidence 2. Mancheng only has small reservoirs and ditch-furrowed fields but has not dug ponds

    建议改进河北水利计划，保证省、快、好、多地消灭水灾
    王葆真的发言
    我听到毛主席十二项的指示和周总理、李富春副总理、陈叔通副主席各个报告，我以极欣喜的心情，表示同意和拥护，并要求自己努力学习以期符合贯彻党和政府各项方针与政策。为了对社会主义建设贡献出一知半解，我对李副总理所言大、中、小型水利相结合，及指出小型水利，既省经济又省时间的说法，完全表示衷心的拥护。同时，感觉得自己有责任应当提出改进河北水利计划的建议。由于这几年来的视察制度给了我们在研究和学习上很多的便利，增长了我们的智识，才能写出这个建议，我对中央的领导视察和各省市党政干群的协助，表示非常感谢。现在除提出建议书外，应即说明建议的理由：
    我国解放以来，水利建设的辉煌成就，中外赞扬，非短时间所能尽述。政府将于第二个五年国民经济计划中更有进一步的规划，这是符合人民共同要求的。河北水患不仅关系地方人民的生活，实于国民经济计划的完成，有其直接而密切的关联。例如河北棉产占全国棉产量40％，数年来只以水灾原因，未能完成产量指标。仅以1956年计之，因潦减产皮棉三亿斤，即等于七十七万件纱，又等于七个至八个国棉二厂的一年产量，亦即等于七十七万个纱锭缺乏一年的生产资料。又如粮食减产五十亿斤，需要中央调拨大批粮食供应；因而需要调拨大批车辆往返运输；以及赈款的救济；农业税的免征；医药防疫的消耗；交通的阻滞；工商业的困窘；受灾农民生活的贫苦；此皆国民经济中直接的损失。至于间接的地方文化、教育、行政、司法均无不受到水灾的影响，至少延缓其工作成绩的提高和进步，曾有多少事例可证。此足证明关系国民经济计划的重要。虽地区限于一省，而水利计划的领导、批准与一切支持，其权实在中央。我曾经在河北省数次提出我的意见，但是问题的决定在中央。应再向中央提出“改进河北水利计划的建议”：
    一、研究、分析河北水灾的情况及其原因。
    （1）河北省的水灾，历年沥潦情况较河淹为重，兹将各年淹潦数字例举如下：1949年淹田总数三千三百万亩
  河淹占三分之一
  沥潦占三分之二1950年淹田一千七百万亩
  河淹七百八十八万亩
  沥潦九百一十二万亩1951年淹田总数四百九十八万零七百一十
    七亩
  河淹四十七万零五百零四亩
  沥潦四百五十一万零二百一十三亩1952年淹田总数一百零八万亩
  河淹八十三万二千亩
  沥潦二十四万八千亩1953年淹田总数二千九百七十八万九千四
    百三十亩
  河淹五百四十四万多亩
  沥潦二千四百三十四万多亩1954年淹田总数三千九百六十五万七千零十一亩
  河淹一千四百七十二万三千一百零一亩
  沥潦二千四百九十三万三千九百一十亩1955年淹田总数一千七百六十九万五千四
    百二十一亩
  河淹七百零五万八千五百四十八亩
  沥潦一千零六十三万六千八百七十三亩1956年淹田总数四千五百万亩
  河淹三分之一
  沥潦占三分之二
    由以上八个年的淹潦数字看来，只有两年比较是旱年（51年、52年）雨水较少的年月。其中河淹数字多于沥潦者，仅有一年，其他七年皆是沥潦数字远远超过河淹数字。由此说明欲治河北水灾，仅仅解决山洪与河淹，断不能消灭大部分沥潦的灾害，其理甚明。
    但是在1954年以前，河北水利工作仅仅在山洪与河道下工夫，而且并未解决了山洪与河道大部分的灾害。当然用了好多人工和水利经费也有部分的成绩。然对于解决河淹，距离尚远，更未注意消灭沥潦，是故河北水灾年复一年的严重。
    （2）灾害的主要原因。
    每届大水灾后，人们常说：今年雨水特别大，是不可抗拒的天灾。在这个语言之下，人们可以宽恕领导水利工作者的责任，同时也就不研究水利工作的得失利害。但是我们幸逢社会主义讲真理的时代，正需要研究灾害的主要原因，才可以明确解决问题的关键。
    河北燕山太行恒山各山脉千里濯濯，七、八月间，雨量集中，山洪暴至，河防溃决，加以沥水潦溢，无地容泄，遂至人畜沦溺，田舍漂没。就自然界的现象而言，虽然是天灾，但这是可以战胜的天灾，实由于人力未尽，故成为灾害。试以江南与河北相较，便可以了如指掌。
    1954年湖南省平均雨量二千公厘以上，如宁乡县二千二百公厘；而河北是年平均雨量为八百一十二公厘，是河北雨量少于湖南一倍半。但是年河北淹潦三千九百六十五万亩，多于湖南淹潦面积数字的三倍。何故相差如此之大，只因湖南塘坝沟渠甚多，能可容蓄大量雨水，而河北全省的沟渠塘坝甚少，大雨一至，只有任其泛滥为灾。是故雨量的灾害可以战胜，而水利计划之不讲，乃是不能战胜水灾的主要原因。
    河北各县党政干群对防汛、排潦、兴修水利，都尽了最大的努力，甚至艰苦斗争，以身挡水，不少可歌可泣之事。但严重的灾害，仍是年年袭来，此其故不在党政干群，而在水利计划没有切中实际的要害。
    马克思说，埃及由于尼罗河泛滥为灾，就发展了水利技术。列宁曾经指示，研究分析自然法则，控制它，利用它，可变水害为水利。我国社会主义建设以来，各个部门都欢迎合理化的建议。但由于少数人在思想上拒绝接纳合理化的建议，致使可以提早消灭的水灾，反而一年一年的加重，遂至给予国民经济遭受巨大的损失，此实为造成灾害的一个重要原因，亟应予以检讨，加强改进水利计划，并付诸实施。
    二、关于防治河北水灾有各种不同的意见。
    （1）浚河培堤说。
    （2）重修宁晋泊、大陆泽及旧河道沟说。
    （3）上游造林，保持水土说。
    （4）等待修造大水库说。
    （5）低洼地区改造说。
    （6）改种水稻说。
    （7）沟洫畦田与土埂畦田说。
    以上七种防治河北水灾的说法，皆有部分的理由，有必须采用者，有可并行无矛盾者，有不能实行者，但皆非根治河北水灾的最关键性的办法。其理由另详。
    三、我的建议改进河北水利计划具体意见的提纲。
    （1）小型水利与国家计划中大水库及各河流域规划相互配合修建，以期全面地消灭水旱灾害，更顺利地进行社会主义建设事业。
    （2）上游，山区（包括河源邻省山区）丘陵地区多修建小型水库和塘堰以及谷坊和各种水土保持工程，以蓄住山洪，减少河潦，并可以灌溉高地的田亩。
    （3）中游，平坦地区开掘沟渠、池塘与沟洫畦田相结合，以消灭沥潦，并以蓄住雨水的池塘，便利灌溉。
    （4）下游，平坦地区开掘沟池，低洼地区开修台田并建筑围堤，积潦地区及河水狭隘险要汇合处，开减河或疏浚旧有的减河加宽加深。
    （5）洼碱地区，开修台田，或改作稻田，以洗碱防潦（中、下游均有洼碱地区）。
    （6）把井泉、小型水库、沟渠、池塘结合起来使用，以消灭旱灾。
    （7）水利与造林关系密切，需要计划分区育苗，逐步进行，便利水土保持，及早完成山区绿化。
    上列七项意见的提出，系根据屡次视察中所见事例的印证和四年来向省和中央屡次提出的意见、建议、发言颇多符合，现在加以综合整理，成为上列七项意见。如被采用实施，必须因地制宜，因时制宜。这个意见，我曾在1956年10月末旬又向河北省人代大会提出了建议性的发言，尚未知是否采纳，兹特再提出。至各项意见的理由与其重要的意义，容再详谈。
    四、修建小型水库和池塘的利益。
    有人说，大水库可起作用，或者说沿河流可以修小水库，其他地方则不可。我认为大水库收效大，诚然不错。但是费款多，需时久，且不能全面解决山洪。又如只在河流上修，占面积小，蓄水有限。如果沿山区丘陵地带，多修建一些小水库，特别是在国民经济还没发展到高度的情况下，多修建小型水库，既经济，又可大量蓄水，这不仅可减少山区被冲刷和减少入河的洪水，免至淹潦下游；而且可以减少山区旱灾的威胁，因而建议大量兴修小型水库。
    据视察各省所见，小水库和塘坝建设费用甚少，建成时间很短，不需要钢铁器材，只用当地民力，由受益者出工，人皆乐从。为了解决群众自己的利害问题，群众都能理解。这就是又快、又多、又好、又省的办法。
    例如宁乡干部说：全县已有水塘五万四千八百九十口，新建小水库七十三座，河坝六千一百座，尚拟在沙河上游修建水库可能容纳二百万亩的雨量。醴陵干部说，已建水塘三万一千九百九十六口，圳（沟）一千八百零一条，小型水库八十二座，明年计划建新塘和小型水库一百多个，计划毁田千余亩作为新开塘址。还说，他们算清了账，宁改变少数田亩作塘堰，以提高多数田亩产量，而不因吝惜少数田亩，以降低多数田亩的产量。他们抛弃了保守思想，故不惜因为兴办水利牺牲土地，这就答复了沟渠池塘占用土地、减少生产的反对意见。
    我在1956年秋曾询河北新造小型水库多少，一说七十多个，一说四百多个，究不知谁确，也可能四百多个包括山塘在内，以一省与宁醴两县水利相比，得失利害可以立判。
    关于修建池塘的好处，在山区和丘陵地区称山塘，在平原称平塘，主要是蓄沥水，减免涝灾。山塘可起拦洪及灌溉的作用；平塘可起蓄泄兼利的作用。夏季阴雨连绵，田间积水数日，易致禾苗枯死，如修若干池塘，使水有所归宿，沥水灾害即可免除。至于形式大小，可因地制宜。有沟渠连通，控制蓄泄，与沟洫畦田相结合。浅深远近，尺度距离，以消纳雨量，保证消灭沥涝为标准。沟渠池塘所占之地，可种水产植物莲、菱、蒲、芦，可以养鱼养鸭。沟边、塘边可以搭架，可种一切蔓生植物，如丝瓜、北瓜、南瓜、东瓜、瓠子、江豆、扁豆、葡萄，还可种瓜蒌、黑白丑等许多蔓生药草，一位农学院教授说：池塘生产比旱田还多，这也答复了占地问题。同时，亦可减少洪水急流入河，不致淹没下游地区，即可解决下游灾害。这是上下兼利之事，也是消灭水灾的共同义务。沟渠池塘，还可涵养地下水源，在天旱较长的时期，亦可增加井水泉源。所以说沟渠池塘是保证增产的好办法。
    据邓子恢副总理报告，在去年全国修建小型水库二万七千多座，塘坝、渠道三百八十万处。河北省耕地面积占全国耕地总面积十三分之一以上，而去年修建小水库（包括山塘在内）只有四百多个，比各省甚少，无容纳雨量的设备，怎能不淹潦呢？
  五、对各项反对改进的意见，作如下的解答。
    1953年冬和1954年春，我提出改进河北水利意见的时候，我很感谢负责河北省水利工作的同志们，说出了不少的反对意见，使我能知问题的所在，可以更进一步的研究和证明。这几年来我在视察中和阅读中，已经获得了不少有力的证明，可知孰得孰失。因为时间关系，我现在仅能简单地解答如下：
    （1）占地问题。反对者说：沟渠池塘占用不少田地，将至减少生产。
    这一问题，在前项已有答复。所占地约在5％至8％，所保证免除水灾者，约占92％以上，较比多数田亩受灾，显然得失分明。地下水位低者，挖深、占地少；地下水位高者，挖浅、占地多；最浅者蓄水改种稻田，增多产量。况池塘沟渠均可利用增加生产，除塘内、沟边生产外，既可免除潦灾，更可提高田亩产量，保证丰收。试观江南各省利用生产情况，可为明证。若仅仅顾虑沟池占地，而不考虑水灾损害有十倍于占地的重大。只有让沥潦灾害年复一年的恣肆猖狂。现在淹潦数字占耕地总面积35％。可知孰得孰失。
    （2）障碍机耕问题。有人说：田有沟池，障碍机耕，妨害工业化。
    1954年冬我到宁河国营农场视察机耕距离，又在芦台拖拉机站详询机耕距离，去年11月间我又到京东双桥农场详询机耕回转次数与减少耕速的差距。都可证明沟渠池塘对于机耕速度并无很大的障碍。虽在回旋时，有很微小的延缓耕作时间，但沟池保护机耕的效果大于因延缓时间减少耕速的损失，可能在几十倍以上。双桥机耕农场，连年遭受水灾损失严重，利害轻重，可以判明。
    双桥农场“德特54型”拖拉机，同样耕地深度为二十二公分（约七寸）同时带丁齿耙，耙地一次，在不同的长度地段，班工作量如下：
    地段长一千公尺　宽一百公尺班工作量（十时）八十七亩
    地段长五百公尺　宽五十公尺班工作量　八十五亩
    地段长三百公尺　宽五十公尺班工作量　八十二亩
    由此表来看，按一个月计算，第二种只差六十亩，差不到一日的工作量；第三种只差一百五十亩，差不到两日的工作量。而实际沟、池相互距离，到第三种短距离者甚少。倘无沟、池消灭水灾，使机耕效果的丧失，即等于浪费了机耕大部分的设备。
    （3）有人说，全面改进水利，必须等待测量十年。
    这种说法，已在沟洫畦田与土埂畦田的推广中，自行取消。但沟洫畦田与土埂畦田并不能完全解决问题。对不能解决问题的办法，却可以立即推广，而对可能保证解决问题的办法，反要推迟十年，将何以自解。
    本来乡村水流高下，老农自知，可能知道本村的水流向何方，何用测量十年，这是假话。
    （4）有人说，改进全面水利，兴修小水库、沟渠、池塘，需要国家支给大宗经费。
    小型水利，有的民办公助；有的人民自办。群众为了自己农作物获得丰收，付出自己的劳力是应该的，江南各省是这样。虽然可以民办公助，但也可以领导人民自办，而不应当借口需要国家支给大宗经费，就不发动人民自办。
    （5）对沟渠、池塘，人民未必愿出劳力；群众未必赞同。
    近年为了防汛工作，人民年年付出劳力很多，结果还是年年受灾，浪费了不少的人力。江浙各省人民为了兴修水利，付出了很多劳力，江宁、邗江、昆山各县去春每人付出五、六十个工，都获得了丰收。1954年雨季河北省新乐县人民，挖了临时的池塘沟渠不少，保住相当收成。1955年春季省人代大会时，定县代表提案请在县内试办池塘、沟渠以消灭水灾，竟未邀允准。这可见不是群众不希望改进，而是主持水利工作者不同意。又在1955年冬季武安县伯延乡合作社对我说：它社自行开掘七亩三分大的池塘蓄水，以备点种万亩棉田之用。这证明了群众对于改进水利的要求。
    （6）有人说，掘出沟池的土，无法摊土。
    改进水利计划，应当分出步骤，以三年至五年，分期兴工，分期掘土，分期摊土，土少田多，浅铺易耕，连耕两次，新旧和匀。老农说：“新土和旧土，打石（音担）五，（言收获多）”但竟有人相信，无法摊土，比打通上甘岭的战壕还要困难。
    （7）有人说，冬天冻，春天忙，无法施工。
    这种说法，应当已被农业合作化的高潮惊醒。1955年冬至1956年春，正是冬冻春忙的季节，各地兴修了好多水利工程。
    （8）有人说，沟水生碱，把好地碱化。
    这个问题，已在全国人民代表大会第三次会议时，须恺代表发言中和我的发言中解答了。挖沟适合尺度，不但不生碱而且可以洗碱，把碱性逐渐消灭。
    （9）有人说，水利建设是长期工作，可能是三十年、五十年，不能求速效。
    这一说，对大江、大河、大水库的建设，可能是如此想。但在农业发展纲要中，已经规定了十二年内基本消灭水旱灾害。尤其河北人民在沦溺、饥饿之中，谁也不愿这样长期地等待。那是因为想不出短期内消灭水灾办法，才这样讲的。如果肯采用七项意见，在三年至五年内，即可基本上消灭水灾是有根据的。
    （10）有人说，水利建设不可能有全面的系统的计划。
    河北省56年水利纠纷甚多，灾害因以加重，正是因为无有全面计划，上下游不相顾，没有系统的组织建设所造成。
    （11）有人说，池塘漏水，不能灌溉和养鱼。
    这是白土、沙土地区有这种情形，但河北这样地区，实占很少的面积。这样地区的池塘，虽不能养鱼灌溉，总可以消纳沥潦灾害。终胜于无有池塘，致使田中存水淹死禾稼。这是以防潦为主要，而防旱养鱼为次要。虽不能养鱼，尚可种植其他水产作物。并且漏塘也可以改造。
    在有黄土、胶土的池塘，不易渗漏，或第一、二年有些渗漏，过了三年，即不渗漏，或用辗石辗轧几遍，或用夯筑实，亦不渗漏。
    我看了饶阳县五公村附近耿尚乡合作社，利用村边几个水坑养鱼。据社干报告，每个水坑养了几千条鱼，每条都长得一斤多重，比种地收益还多。这说明河北绝大部分地区是适宜修凿池塘沟渠的。
    （12）池水容易蒸发，未便用作灌溉。
    这一说者，应知按河北每月水分蒸发表计算，六七尺深的池塘在八九月间蓄满一池水，至第二年4月间，尚可存三尺左右深的水量，可供春灌之用，保住点种棉花和麦季的收成。若是塘深一丈以上，存水更多。这一观点，也是忘了池塘的任务，主要在解免潦灾，次要才是防旱。
    大兴县水柜暴露，有人建议隔岸建房遮蔽阳光免于蒸发。县中负责同志说，所费太多，暂不能办。我说只须沿岸种植长蔓植物如葡萄架等，即可避免蒸发，亦可增产。县中同志欣然接纳。
    （13）有人说：沟渠池塘，只适宜于南方，北方不能适用。
    “苏联于1948年10月20日，通过了一个庞大的改造自然计划，……在集体农庄和国营农场中筑造四万五千二百二十八个池塘和蓄水池。”“莫洛托夫农庄，开凿七个大池塘养鱼养鸭。”河北省比苏联地区还在以南，为什么不适宜？宁河也有养水站和沟渠、稻田，通专去年开了一个很大的池塘也起了作用。湖南雨水多，平均每百亩田，至少有十亩塘，有些地区十亩田有二、三亩塘。河北雨水少，虽不用十分之一的池塘，但可百亩田五亩塘，一亩沟，或者多一些，少一些，但总不可无防潦蓄水的设备。
    北方雨量虽少，因为集中在7、8月间，故汇成巨灾，必须有小水库和沟渠池塘以分散水势，方能保证消灭水灾，其理至明。北方连年灾害严重，人民生活困苦，正是因为水利观点落后于南方。
    （14）挖池塘时，水位浅，挖出水来怎么办？
    水位高时，最好挖出泉水，水源足时改种稻田，产量更大。如大兴县新开稻田万亩以上，去年在潦灾中，而稻田收四百斤左右，同时亦可多消纳一部分潦水。满城县亦有此例。
    （15）小型水利与河道工作有矛盾；或说先修河道后挖沟池。
    为是说者，是把沟渠池塘看成与河道对立；或是以河道为主要，而小水库、沟渠、池塘为次要。我在改进水利的七项意见中（1）项，“小型水利与国家计划中大水库及各河流域规划互相配合修建。”这已经说明了不是对立的而是合作互助的。它的合作互助，即在于调节蓄泄，分工合作，以此消灭旱潦灾害。县干部说，我们年年修堤，年年防汛，年年受潦，年年救灾。昨年各堤决口百处以上，可见只是浚河培堤，保障流量，是不能解决问题的。必须把小水库、池塘、沟渠搞好，蓄洪渟沥，减轻河道的负担，自然河无涨溢，堤免溃决。但不是说只要兴修小型水利，不要重视河道岁修，而是大、小兼顾，更需要各河流域规划及早编制，以便干沟与塘、库、涵、闸，通贯河川，控制流量。但也不是说必须先有流域规划，而后兴修水利。如江宁县去年修建许多塘、库，并未等秦淮整理，亦已获得增产成绩。这样例证各省都有。
    为什么在南方容易认识沟、塘、小水库的效用，而在河北有这些反对的意见呢？这在北方治水的历史上是一个新鲜的建议，也可能是因为水利学说上没有这一章，遭受反对，不应当以为奇怪。特别是要想把沟渠、池塘、小水库写成为有计划的、有系统的消灭水灾的理论，更是中国几千年来水利论著中很少看到；而且也未听到水利学者，有这样的一个计划；尽管在事实上南方各省作了不少的沟、塘、圩、库，我到了苏沪浙湘各省，访求有关这一类的著作，并未找到。但是这一改进河北水利计划的意见，水利部并未曾表示反对，而且部中有三位水利学者，都曾明确地表示同意。为了进一步明确前述七项改进意见的理由，我在1953年冬，曾提出关于根治河北水灾理论上的意见如下：
    就地治水，分散水势，因蓄为泄，因泄为蓄，蓄泄兼顾，上下均利。全面规划，因地制宜，疏导并用，旱潦可济。
    1956年河北省通专与津专、邢专与邯专都闹水利纠纷，其原因就是没有就地治水，分散水势；因为有泄无蓄，上下均不利；因为没有全面规划，也不能起疏导的作用，就造成了严重的灾害。
    六、河北水利计划改进的必要。
    近四年来河北省共淹潦一亿三千二百一十四万一千八百六十二亩田。除棉粮减产而外，倒房几百万间，漂没牲畜财物等等，共计所值，据说：四年来河北省因水灾遭受的各项损失，当在百亿元左右。而且每年不少的水利经费等于虚掷，内务部不能不拨出大宗赈款救济难民，粮食部不惟减少收入并必须拨出大批粮食供应，各部门直接间接损失的数字，都非少数。最是千万以上的灾民，吃糠咽菜的困苦生活，令人关心。河北农业合作化的旗帜耿长锁社，去年积肥甚多，精耕细作，满拟大量增产，一潦减产七成，影响农社经济，何等严重。使我不能不想到假使两三年前，领导水利工作者如肯虚心地考虑接纳改进河北水利计划的建议，断然水灾不致如此的严重，这不是空想而是可以证明的。
    证一，经过几年严重灾害的压迫和干部同志们提出意见，不能不略有改进，从1955年满城始有沟洫畦田的试验，1956年始有小型水库的修建完成，据说54年满城淹潦九万多亩，55年淹潦三万亩，去年雨量九百公厘，多于往年，而只淹田八百多亩，此其明证一。
    证二，满城只有小水库和沟洫畦田而未掘池塘，沟洫之水一泄而下，淹潦下游邻县清苑，灾情颇重。清苑县就向上级和省人代大会告了满城，说满城挖了沟，不蓄而泄，流下甚急，至使清苑人民受灾惨重，此其明证二。这是很好地说明了池塘的重要意义，这是势所必至，我早在意见书中明白地写出了。而且几次曾经向省领导水利工作者说明这个理由，但是丝毫不值得注意。
    证三，据大兴县负责干部说：水利厅令这县搞沟洫畦田，就与安次县发生了水利纠纷。因为挖了渠十四条，沟水流下正淹安次西乡，安次便发动群众借筑路为名，沿县西境筑成了一道长堤，截住了大兴县十四道的沟水。水无出路，漫淹了大兴县的东境几十个村庄的田禾。县问厅如何解决，厅无办法回答，两年纠纷尚未解决。我说在县境内多挖些池塘，是不是可以解决潦水？县负责人说：这是一个办法。这说明仅有沟洫畦田而无池塘是不能完全解决问题的；这又证明了建议中的重要关键性。
    现在河北人民已经饱受水灾的惨痛教训，不要再想弯弯曲曲的、枝枝节节的、没有切实效果的一些治水办法，这一种思想已经给河北人民造成了不少严重的灾害，而应当重新考虑，公开地接纳合理化的建议了。
    七、怎样省、快、好、多地消灭水灾和怎样保证呢？
    我最初思考这个建议，就是从省、快、好、多的方向来考虑这个问题。怎样办呢？（1）小型水利，或由民办公助，或由民众自办，不需钢铁物资，不需机器，比较投资少，效果大，因此灾害减少，农税增多，而救济费、调拨粮运费都可以减少。是省。（2）发动民力就近施工，分区设计，分年进行，众擎易举，劳力从容，至多五年，基本完成，是快。这在第三次全国人民代表大会历举江宁、扬州、昆山群众完成水利土工数字，可以证明。（3）就地治水，分散水势，因地制宜，蓄泄兼顾，免潦减旱，保证增产。是好。（4）全面规划，上下相顾，部省合作，水网密布，脉络贯通，沟塘河库，山岭海滨，到处建筑，滴滴雨雪，控制自如，蓄泄航溉，利兴害除。是多。
    用什么作保证呢？我们有三个有利条件：第一个是中共领导下对干部马列主义的教育，可以动员广大的干部和群众；第二个农业合作化后劳力和土地都可统一使用；第三个我们有科学上的计算方法，包括山区、平原面积数字及耕地数字，季节雨量集中数字，受灾田亩数字，小水库、沟渠、池塘、河川容量及流量数字，工程土方数字，以及分区、分年、分日兴工的数字，加以综合与分析的核算。由此可得作出假设：动员河北劳动力一千万人在冬春季节农作不忙之时，兴修沟渠、塘、库。每人分担半亩面积的工程，约用一百五十工至二百工，每年出五十工即三年至四年完成。以出工日与去年江宁县的农民兴修塘库出工日期五十日至六十日相比并不多，若与洞庭湖区农民每年兴修水利有四个月的时间相比，为数更少。四年之后，完成沟渠、塘、库五百万亩，使一山之水入一山之库，一乡之水入一乡之塘。即可能容蓄五百万亩一丈深的水量。以此消纳1956年四千五百万亩的水灾，绰可有余；而消纳54年、53年、55年的水灾，当更不成问题。似此计划改进，民不甚劳，农不失时，灾害可除，丰收可致，亦即可保住一亿三千万亩全省耕地的增产，亦即可免去如1956年一年内约五十亿元资财的损失。这样教导人民使用少数的劳动力，即可保证千万人民的终年劳动的成果不至随水漂没，放任自流；这样使用田地，便可完成棉粮增产指标；这样改进河北水利计划，便可以掌握住切实有效的办法。这虽是一个假设，还不是固定的数字。但由于这些条件和方法，我敢相信在我们提高了社会主义觉悟的时期，根据客观事实，结合群众经验，掌握自然法则，精打细算，因地制宜，一定能省、快、好、多地战胜几千年来未能战胜的洪、沥灾害；保证农业增产，富裕人民生活；保证完成第二个国民经济计划所给予河北人民的任务。为此，我殷切地希望政府能采纳这个建议。
    最后，说明河北水利计划的改进，还应当随着时代的前进和建设的发展而不断地改进和发展。我既非水利学者又无行政的实践，对于水利知识是有局限性；可能对于水利工作的观察是有错误的。我欢迎反对、辩难和批评的意见，好作进一步的修正，期能有助于解决水灾的损害和人民的疾苦。敬希指正。
