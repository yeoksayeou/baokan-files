Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 17th (Xinhua reporter Xu Zhongni summarizes the situation in Shanghai's struggle to overcome raw material difficulties this year):

Shanghai's industry, which accounts for one-fifth of the country's total industrial output value, feels even more significantly this year that the supply of raw materials cannot keep up with the needs of production growth. The most acutely felt shortages are in pig iron and some steel, chemical raw materials, cotton, coal, timber, paper, and many types of raw materials from rural areas.

Shanghai's industrial raw materials mainly rely on supplies from all over the country, but Shanghai itself still has considerable potential in terms of increasing raw material sources and improving raw material utilization rates. The various measures proposed by the CPC Committee, the government, and industrial and commercial leaders after investigation and research in recent months to overcome raw material difficulties have already begun to be implemented.

The most powerful measure is to increase raw material production, and efforts are currently underway in several areas simultaneously.

Not long ago, Shanghai proposed a measure to cooperate with other provinces to build small-scale smelting plants, and has already agreed with Zhejiang Province to build two iron smelting plants in Shaoxing and Hangxian with a total annual output of 60,000 to 80,000 tons. In the one in Shaoxing, Shanghai invests two-thirds. The First Bureau of Heavy Industry has already begun to design and manufacture the required mechanical and electrical equipment, and it is expected that pig iron can be produced and supplied to Shanghai in the second half of the year. Shanghai's measures to strengthen cooperation with other provinces have aroused great interest from local industrial departments in various provinces. According to reporters, Hunan, Jiangxi, Shandong, Fujian, and other provinces have recently come to discuss cooperation with Shanghai to develop the production of locally mined iron ore and other raw materials.

Shanghai's iron and steel industry is also actively implementing measures to increase production. This year, it plans to produce more than 50,000 tons of steel more than last year under difficult conditions such as using less scrap steel, using more low-quality high-phosphorus pig iron, and mixing in local iron.

At the same time, the chemical raw materials that are currently most lacking are also being accelerated for trial production and increased production. The Municipal People's Committee recently allocated more than 700,000 yuan, ordering chemical and dye companies to re-trial produce and increase production of more than ten types of raw materials. Prior to this, Shanghai had already successfully experimented with using boron ore from Liaoning to process borax, using monazite to process thorium nitrate, using manganese ore to process manganese powder, and using low-grade paraffin wax to process high-grade paraffin wax, and has trial-produced and increased production of more than twenty types of chemical raw materials that previously needed to be imported. A total of more than forty types are planned for trial production and increased production in the first half of this year. This effort can not only partially overcome the current supply difficulties, but also make it possible to make more use of domestic resources and save foreign exchange.

Finding more raw materials from discarded materials is another front in the struggle against raw material difficulties. Last year, waste product companies and recycling stations alone recovered useful materials worth more than 38 million yuan. More than 3 million yuan worth of materials can be sorted out from the city's more than 20,000 garbage bins in a year. According to estimates by relevant departments after investigation, after strengthening this work, it is possible to recover at least 50 million yuan worth of raw materials a year (excluding the part recovered and utilized in factory production).

The Shanghai Municipal People's Committee is also preparing to mobilize neighborhood residents to establish recycling groups more extensively, and at the same time, it is calling on all agencies, schools, and organizations to clean up old newspapers, old account books, and all unnecessary files, reports, and waste materials that have been accumulated for many years, and supply them to papermaking and other industries for recycling as raw materials. This is a vast source of raw materials. According to reporters, a small agency with less than 100 people recently sold more than 800 yuan just by cleaning up a batch of old newspapers that had been accumulated for more than seven years. In addition, industrial and commercial departments are also preparing to send experienced personnel to cities and vast towns in other provinces to collect.

In the city's more than 20,000 factories, people are also trying every possible means to produce more and better industrial products with less raw materials. According to summarized statistics, the city can save about 150,000 tons of coal this year. The central and local mechanical and electrical industries estimate that they can save about 30,000 tons of steel this year by improving design, technology, reducing defective products, and strengthening recycling. The cotton textile industry can increase production by 1.8 million bolts of cotton cloth this year by using raw cotton in grades, using scraps to spin coarse yarn, and improving some cotton cloth specifications. Commercial and industrial departments can save 30,000 tons of paper this year by saving paper for commodity packaging. Scientific and technical personnel are also engaged in extensive research and experiments. The experiments of several kinds of substitute imported materials, such as using barium oxide instead of magnet steel, have initially achieved results.

The measures to overcome raw material difficulties also include clearing warehouse materials, organizing the adjustment of raw materials between central and local enterprises and between various industries, and organizing a large number of experienced personnel to purchase raw materials throughout the country.

Shanghai's industrial production in the first two months of this year was normal, with a total output value higher than the 21% target that accounts for the annual plan. From March onwards, the tense situation of the supply of various raw materials gradually affected many industries. Because the implementation of various measures takes a certain amount of time (some will not take effect until next year), coupled with the insufficient quantity of certain materials allocated by the state and the untimely allocation, the second quarter will be the most difficult period. For Shanghai to complete its annual production plan, it requires strong support from the whole country and more efforts from the city's workers and residents. The Shanghai Municipal Planning Commission and various industrial departments are strengthening the unified allocation of raw materials and the organization of production arrangements. After a period of brewing and preparation, the city's more than 1.4 million workers have launched an advanced producer movement centered on increasing production and practicing economy.

    同外省合作、利用本国资源、提高利用率、回收废料
    上海采取有力措施增产原材料
    新华社上海17日电　新华社记者徐中尼综述上海今年克服原材料困难的斗争情势：
    在全国工业总产值中占五分之一的上海工业，今年更加显著地感到原材料的供应赶不上生产增长需要的困难。最感不足的是生铁和部分钢材、化工原料、棉花、煤炭、木材、纸张和许多种来自农村的原材料。
    上海工业原材料主要依靠全国的供应，但上海本身在增加原材料来源和提高原材料利用率两个方面还有不小的潜力。几个月来中共党委、政府和工商领导部门经过调查、研究以后提出的各项克服原材料困难的措施，已经开始执行。
    最有力的措施是增加原料生产，目前正从几个方面同时着手。
    不久以前，上海提出了同外省合作兴建小型冶炼厂的措施，已经同浙江省协议兴建绍兴、杭县两个年产量共六万到八万吨的炼铁厂。在绍兴的一个，上海投资三分之二。第一重工业局已经开始设计制造所需要的机电设备，预计下半年内就可以炼出生铁供应上海。上海加强同外省合作的措施，引起了各省地方工业部门很大的兴趣。据记者获悉，湖南、江西、山东、福建等省最近都来接洽跟上海合作，发展当地手工开采的铁矿等原料的生产。
    上海的钢铁工业也正在积极实现增产措施。今年计划在少用废钢、多用质量差的高磷生铁和掺用土铁等困难条件下，比去年还要增产五万多吨钢。
    与此同时，目前最感缺乏的化工原料也在加速进行试制和增产。市人民委员会最近拨出七十多万元资金，责成化工和染料公司再试制和增产十多种原料。在此以前，上海已经试验成功用辽宁的硼矿石加工硼砂，用独居石加工硝酸钍，用锰矿石加工锰粉，用低度石蜡加工高度石蜡，共试制和增产了二十多种过去需要进口的化工原料。今年上半年内共计划试制和增产四十多种。这方面的努力不仅可以部分地克服当前供应困难，而且从此可以更多地利用本国的资源，节约外汇。
    从废弃物资中寻找更多的原材料，是另一条同原材料困难作斗争的战线。去年仅废品公司和回收站就回收了价值三千八百多万元的有用物资。全市两万多个垃圾箱一年约可整理出三百多万元的物资。根据有关部门经过调查以后的估计，加强了这方面的工作以后，一年至少可以回收价值五千万元的原材料（不包括工厂企业生产中回收利用的部分）。
    上海市人民委员会还准备发动里弄居民更广泛地建立回收小组，同时号召所有机关、学校、团体清理一次积存多年的旧报纸、旧账册和一切无须保存的文件、报表和废旧物资，供给造纸和其他工业回收作原料。这是一笔浩大的原料来源。据记者了解，一个不足百人的小机关，最近只是清理了积存七年多的一批旧报纸就卖了八百多元。此外，工商业部门还准备派遣有经验的人员到外省城市和广大乡镇去从事收集。
    在全市两万多家工厂里，人们也正在千方百计地设法用更少的原材料生产更多、更好的工业品。根据汇总统计，今年全市可以节约十五万吨左右的煤炭。中央和地方的机电工业今年在改进设计、工艺和减少废品、加强回收等方面，估计可以节约三万吨左右的钢铁。棉纺织工业在原棉分级使用、利用下脚纺粗纱以及改进部分棉布规格等方面，今年可以增产一百八十万匹棉布。商业和工业部门在节约商品包装用纸方面今年可以节约纸张三万吨。科学技术人员也正在从事广泛的研究试验。若干种代用进口材料的试验，如用氧化钡代替磁钢等，已经初步取得成果。
    在克服原材料困难的各项措施中，还包括清理仓库物资，组织中央和地方企业之间、各行业之间的原材料调剂工作，组织大批熟门熟路的人员到全国各地去采购原材料。
  上海工业在今年头两个月的生产是正常的，生产总值高于占全年计划21％的指标。从3月份起，各项原材料供应紧张的情况，逐渐影响到许多行业。由于实现各项措施需要一定的时间（有的要到明年才见效），加上国家分配的某些物资数量不足、调拨不及时，第二季度将是最困难的时期。上海完成全年的生产计划需要全国大力的支援和全市职工、居民更多的努力。上海市计划委员会和各工业部门正在加强统一分配原材料和安排生产的组织工作。全市一百四十多万职工经过前一时期的酝酿和准备，已经展开了以增产节约为中心的先进生产者运动。
