　　Archbishop Makarios

    Archbishop Makarios is the leader of the Greek Orthodox Church in Cyprus. He is forty-four years old this year. He was born in 1913 in a farmer's family near Paphos, Cyprus. His original name was Mikhail Mouskos. He became an apprentice monk at the age of thirteen, and later studied at the University of Athens. He began to participate in the movement for the merger of Cyprus and Greece in 1949. He once organized an informal referendum in Cyprus, and the result showed that the vast majority of people favored the merger with Greece. He gradually became the leader of the Cypriot people's struggle for self-determination. In 1955, Archbishop Makarios represented Cyprus in negotiations with the British colonial authorities. Influenced by the strong emotions of the people demanding self-determination, he rejected the British authorities' deceptive "autonomous constitution." The British colonialists became angry and arrested Makarios on March 9 last year, exiling him to the Seychelles. Since then, the demand for the release of Makarios has become the slogan of the Cypriot people's struggle for self-determination. It was precisely because of the Cypriot people's unwavering will to demand self-determination that the British authorities finally had to restore Makarios' freedom.

　　马卡里奥斯大主教
    马卡里奥斯大主教是塞浦路斯希腊正教的领袖。今年四十四岁。1913年出生于塞浦路斯巴佛斯附近的一个农家里。本来的姓名是米哈伊尔·穆斯科斯。十三岁的时候就当见习修道士，后来进雅典大学读书。他在1949年开始参加塞浦路斯和希腊的合并运动，曾在塞浦路斯组织一次非正式公民投票，结果表明绝大多数人赞成和希腊合并。他逐渐成为塞浦路斯人民争取自决斗争的领袖。1955年马卡里奥斯大主教代表塞浦路斯同英国殖民当局进行谈判。他在人民要求自决的强烈情绪影响下，拒绝了英国当局欺骗性的“自治宪法”。英国殖民者就老羞成怒，在去年3月9日逮捕了马卡里奥斯，把他放逐在塞舌耳岛上。从那以后，要求释放马卡里奥斯就成为塞浦路斯人民自决斗争的口号。正是由于塞浦路斯人民要求自决的意志坚不可屈，英国当局才终于不得不恢复了马卡里奥斯的自由。
