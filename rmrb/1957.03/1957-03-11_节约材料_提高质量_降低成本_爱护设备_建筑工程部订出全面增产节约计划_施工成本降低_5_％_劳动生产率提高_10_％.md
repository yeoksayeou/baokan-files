Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The measures and plans for the Construction Engineering Department system to fully launch the production increase and economy movement this year have been drafted by the Construction Engineering Department Design and Construction Conference that concluded yesterday.

The conference, based on the situation that the Construction Engineering Department's construction tasks this year are not large, engineering and design quality urgently needs to be improved, and funds and building materials are insufficient, determined that the focus of this year's production increase and economy movement is to: improve engineering quality and design quality, reduce project costs and project budgets, and strive to over fulfill this year's construction and design tasks.

In terms of construction, engineering costs this year should be 5% lower than the new state-issued construction quota, and 3% lower than the actual decrease last year.

Vigorously saving building materials is an important factor in ensuring the reduction of engineering costs. The conference proposed that this year, through the promotion of prestressed reinforced concrete, dry-hard concrete, bamboo formwork, bamboo scaffolding and other technical measures, we will ensure saving more steel, wood and cement.

The conference demanded that doing a good job in construction preparation, carrying out construction in a balanced manner, ensuring engineering quality and construction safety be regarded as important measures for increasing production and practicing economy this year.

This year, the labor productivity of the Construction Engineering Department system should be increased by 10% compared to last year. The conference proposed that this year, the increase of permanent workers and temporary workers should be stopped, labor organization should be improved, and the rational use of labor should be guaranteed.

Currently, the construction machinery of the construction units under this department is severely damaged, and the utilization rate of machinery only reaches 50%. The conference pointed out that strengthening the maintenance of machinery and improving the utilization rate of machinery is of great significance to saving.

In terms of design, this year's project budget should be greatly reduced on the basis of ensuring quality, among which, the cost of civil engineering is required to be reduced by 5%.

The conference proposed that in the design of industrial buildings, the waste caused by excessive safety factors and excessively high standards should be overcome.

In order to ensure the reduction of project budgets, this year the department will also promote more than 30 technical measures for saving building materials in design, and will re-examine and revise the design of projects that have been designed and are under construction to ensure saving materials and reducing costs.

The conference pointed out that the main obstacles to carrying out the production increase and economy movement are that some cadres have individualistic thoughts and complacent emotions, and some workers have economistic tendencies. Therefore, political and ideological education work must be vigorously carried out, which is an important key to whether the production increase and economy movement can be widely carried out.

    建筑工程部订出全面增产节约计划
    施工成本降低5％　劳动生产率提高10％
    据新华社讯　建筑工程部系统今年全面开展增产节约运动的措施计划，已经由昨天闭幕的建筑工程部设计施工会议拟订出来。
    会议根据建筑工程部今年施工任务不大、工程和设计质量极需改进、资金和建筑材料不足等情况，确定今年增产节约运动的重点是：提高工程质量和设计质量，降低工程成本和工程造价，争取超额完成今年的施工和设计任务。
    施工方面工程成本今年要比国家新颁布的施工定额降低5％，比去年实际降低3％。
    大力节约建筑材料，是保证工程成本降低的一个重要因素。会议提出今年通过推广预加应力钢筋混凝土、干硬性混凝土、竹模板、竹脚手架等技术措施，保证节约更多的钢材、木材和水泥。
    会议要求把做好施工准备工作、均衡进行施工、保证工程质量和施工安全，作为今年增产节约的重要措施。
    今年建筑工程部系统劳动生产率要比去年提高10％。会议提出今年要停止增加固定工人和临时工人，改善劳动组织，保证更合理地使用劳动力。
    目前这个部所属施工单位施工机械损坏严重，机械利用率只达到50％。会议指出加强机械的保养、提高机械利用率，对节约有很大意义。
    设计方面，今年的工程造价要在保证质量的基础上大大降低，其中，要求民用工程造价降低5％。
    会议提出在工业建筑设计中要克服由于安全系数过大、标准过高等所造成的浪费现象。
    为了保证降低工程造价，今年这个部在设计方面还要推广三十多项节约建筑材料的技术措施，并且将对已经设计和正在施工的工程，重新审查和修改设计，保证节约材料，降低造价。
    会议指出目前开展增产节约运动的主要障碍，是部分干部存在着个人主义思想和骄傲自满情绪，部分工人存在着经济主义倾向，因此必须大力进行政治思想教育工作，这是增产节约运动能否广泛开展的重要关键。
