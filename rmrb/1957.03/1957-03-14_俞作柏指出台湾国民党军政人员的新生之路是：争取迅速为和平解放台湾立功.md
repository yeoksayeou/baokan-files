I feel extremely honored, happy, and excited to be invited to attend the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). After listening to Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference and the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li, and Vice Chairman Chen, I have received great education and encouragement, and I express my heartfelt support.

After the mainland was liberated, I fled to Hong Kong because I was unwilling to go to Taiwan to live a life of humiliation, relying on the United States. At the same time, because I had participated in the Kuomintang for decades and had done many things that were unfair to the people, I was afraid that I would not be forgiven by the people. Therefore, for several years, I lived in Hong Kong, practicing medicine. In recent years, I have been moved by the fact that under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the motherland has been built into a prosperous and strong New China, and the people are living a free and happy life. At the same time, I have been inspired by Premier Zhou's repeated great appeals to the Kuomintang people in Taiwan. I abandoned my concerns and resolutely decided to return to the embrace of the motherland in August last year, reunite with my family, and enjoy family happiness. After returning, I not only received the people's forgiveness and was not held accountable for the past, but also received the cordial care of the party and government leaders, allowing me to participate in the work of government agencies. Now, I have been given greater political trust to participate in this National Committee of the CPPCC, which makes me sincerely grateful. In the future, I will devote the remaining strength of my life to repay the Party and the people and work hard for the socialist cause of the motherland.

Now, please allow me to talk about some of my personal thoughts and experiences regarding the liberation of Taiwan. When the people of the whole country are united and full of confidence in carrying out the great socialist construction, and the people of the motherland are living a free and happy life, our sacred territory of Taiwan is still occupied by the American imperialists, and the eight million compatriots in Taiwan are still in deep water, living a poverty-stricken life of being enslaved. This is something we cannot forget and tolerate. Therefore, the liberation of Taiwan is not only the sacred task of the people of the whole country, but also a matter of great urgency. Premier Zhou clearly pointed out at the second meeting of this conference last year: Taiwan is China's sacred territory, the compatriots in Taiwan are part of the Chinese people, and the liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair, which no third party can interfere with. While actively preparing to liberate Taiwan by war, we are still striving to liberate Taiwan peacefully. He also called on the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan to recognize the general trend, take the initiative to break away from the shackles of the American imperialists, and return to the motherland. At the same time, Premier Zhou solemnly announced the lenient policy towards the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan: as long as they are willing to take the path of peaceful liberation, no matter who they are, no matter how big mistakes they have made in the past, the Chinese people will treat them leniently and not hold them accountable for the past. Over the past year, Premier Zhou has repeatedly and earnestly called for unity under the banner of patriotism to jointly solve this matter that belongs to our country's internal affairs. As long as the Kuomintang people can value the interests of the country and the nation, break away from the shackles of American imperialism, the third cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will certainly be realized. At this meeting, Premier Zhou once again called out: Taiwan is China's territory, and the residents of Taiwan, including all Kuomintang military and government personnel, are Chinese. The liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair, a problem that the Chinese people can solve themselves. Since we called for striving for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, more and more Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan are willing to promote peaceful liberation, and the possibility of peaceful liberation of Taiwan is increasing. However, the US government has recently instigated a group of elements who tout so-called "free China" and so-called "Taiwan independence" to carry out activities to overthrow the Taiwan authorities, attempting to turn Taiwan into an American territory like Honolulu. In fact, this kind of trick by the US government can only make all patriotic Chinese people more clearly recognize the true face of the US government's attempt to enslave China. All Chinese people with integrity should, in the spirit of patriotism and family unity, unite and fight against foreign aggression to shatter the conspiracy of American imperialism. This is such a great and earnest appeal. I think anyone with a little conscience and integrity will be deeply moved.

Now, the American imperialists are carrying out an "Embrace America, Oppose Chiang" movement in Taiwan, supporting a group of shameless pro-American elements and proposing to abandon the Kuomintang's propositions in order to weaken the power of the Kuomintang ruling faction and deepen their enslavement and control over Taiwan. Faced with this situation, I believe that the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan will never turn a blind eye. They will never be willing to endure the insults and manipulations of the American imperialists. Currently, under the "anti-Chiang" political offensive instigated by the American imperialists, they should realize that the crisis of relying on external forces to maintain the stalemate, being at the mercy of others, and being sacrificed is imminent. At this time, hearing Premier Zhou's earnest appeal once again, they should feel their past mistakes even more deeply, understand the general trend even better, and understand the sinister and vicious methods of American imperialism towards the Kuomintang people. In order to realize the reunification of the motherland, in order to resist the cruel aggression of American imperialism against Taiwan, and for their own survival and the happiness of their children and grandchildren, I hope that all Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan will take immediate action, join hands with all Taiwan compatriots, respond to the motherland's call for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, and strive to render meritorious service for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. This is their only bright path to a new life. I also earnestly hope that my old friends and former colleagues in Taiwan who have shared weal and woe or held similar views with me in the past should immediately wake up, make a decisive decision, jointly plan to get rid of the shackles of American imperialism, and come to the embrace of the motherland. The time is urgent, and there should be no more hesitation.

Finally, in addition to expressing my sincere support for Premier Zhou's call for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, I am also willing to contribute my own strength in the struggle to liberate Taiwan and strive to realize the complete reunification of the motherland. (Attached picture)

    俞作柏指出台湾国民党军政人员的新生之路是：
    争取迅速为和平解放台湾立功
    我这次被邀列席全国政协会议，感到非常光荣，无限的愉快和兴奋。听了毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话，和周总理、李副总理、陈副主席的报告，使我得到很大的教育和鼓舞，谨表示衷心的拥护。
    我自从大陆解放后就逃居香港，因为不愿去台湾过那仰美帝鼻息被侮辱的生活，但同时又由于我过去参加国民党几十年，曾做过不少对人民不起的事，又恐怕不为人民所宽谅，所以几年来都寄居香港，以行医过活。近年来由于祖国在共产党和毛主席的领导下，已建设为一个繁荣富强的新中国，人民过着自由幸福生活的事实所感动，同时又受到周总理屡次对台湾国民党人的伟大号召所感召，乃摒弃顾虑于去年8月毅然决心回到祖国怀抱，和家人团聚，享受天伦之乐。回来后不仅得到人民的宽大，不咎既往，而且还得到党政首长的亲切关怀，让我参加政府机关工作，现在又给我政治上更大的信任，参加这次全国政治协商会议，真使我衷心感激。今后更要尽我余生的一些力量，以报答党和人民，为祖国社会主义事业而努力。
    现在请让我在这里谈一谈我个人对于解放台湾问题的一些感想和体会。当全国人民团结一致，满怀信心地进行伟大的社会主义建设，祖国人民都过着自由幸福的生活的时候，而我们的神圣领土台湾还在美帝国主义者的霸占下，台湾八百万同胞还处在水深火热之中，过着被奴役的贫困生活，这是我们所不能忘怀和容忍的。因此，解放台湾不仅是全国人民的神圣任务，而且也是急不容缓的事了。周总理去年在本会第二次会议上已经明确指出：台湾是中国的神圣领土，台湾同胞是中国人民的一部分，解放台湾是我国的内政问题，任何第三者都不能干涉。我们在积极准备用战争方式解放台湾的同时，仍努力争取用和平方式解放台湾。并号召在台湾的国民党军政人员认清大势，主动摆脱美帝国主义者的束缚，归还祖国。同时周总理又郑重宣布对待在台湾国民党军政人员的宽大政策，只要愿走和平解放道路，不管任何人，也不管过去犯过多大罪过，中国人民都将宽大对待，不咎既往。一年来周总理屡经苦口婆心地一再号召在爱国主义旗帜下，团结起来共同解决这个属于我国内政的事务。只要国民党人能够以国家民族利益为重，摆脱美帝的羁绊，国民党和共产党的第三次合作是一定能够实现的。在这次会议上周总理又再次号召说：台湾是中国的领土，台湾的居民，包括一切国民党军政人员在内，都是中国人，解放台湾是中国内政，是中国人自己能够解决的问题。自从我们号召争取和平解放台湾以来，台湾国民党军政人员中愿意促进和平解放的人越来越多，和平解放台湾的可能性越来越大了。但是美国政府最近又策动一批标榜所谓自由中国的分子和所谓台湾独立分子，进行推翻台湾当局的活动，企图把台湾变成檀香山一样的美国属地，其实美国政府这种手段，只能使一切爱国的中国人更加认清美国政府企图奴役中国的真面目。一切有血性的中国人，都应本着爱国一家的精神，团结起来，一致对外，粉碎美帝的阴谋。这是多么伟大，多么恳切的号召。我想稍有良心血性的人，都会深受感动的。
    现在美帝又在台湾进行一个“拥美反蒋”运动，扶植一批毫无知耻的亲美分子，提出毁弃国民党的主张来削弱国民党当权派的势力，以加深对台湾的奴役和控制。在这种情势之前，我相信在台湾的国民党军政人员，绝不会熟视无睹的。他们决不甘心忍受美帝的侮辱和摆布的。目前处在美帝策动的“反蒋”政治攻势下，当觉悟到依赖外力维持残局，俯仰由人，被人牺牲的危机就在目前。他们这时又听到周总理又再一次的恳切号召，自当更加痛觉前非，更应了解大势所趋，和美帝国主义者对国民党人的阴险毒辣的手段了。为着实现祖国的统一，为着反抗美帝对台湾的残酷侵略，为着自己的生存和子孙后代的幸福，希望所有在台湾的国民党军政人员迅速采取行动，和全体台湾同胞一起，响应祖国和平解放台湾的号召，争取为和平解放台湾立功，这是他们唯一光明新生的道路。我更热望在台湾过去曾和我共过患难或同过主张的旧朋友们旧同事们，应立即觉悟，当机立断，共策摆脱美帝的羁绊，投靠祖国怀抱，时机已急，莫再迟疑了。
    最后，我除表示竭诚拥护周总理和平解放台湾的号召外，更愿在解放台湾的斗争中，贡献出自己的力量，为实现祖国的完全统一而奋斗。（附图片）
