I fully agree with and support Chairman Mao Zedong’s instructions at the Supreme State Conference, Premier Zhou Enlai’s report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries, and Vice-Chairman Chen Shutong’s work report on the Standing Committee of the CPPCC. We will certainly implement these instructions through all aspects of our work in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, among people of all ethnic groups and from all walks of life.

Under the brilliant illumination of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao's great ethnic policies, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has seen development in various economic and cultural construction undertakings in recent years. The socialist consciousness and socialist enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups have risen to unprecedented heights, ethnic unity has been further strengthened, and the material and cultural living standards of the people of all ethnic groups have also greatly improved.

With the arrival and victory of the nationwide socialist revolution high tide, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has also entered a socialist revolution high tide and achieved a decisive victory. The socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce has been basically completed. The socialist transformation of animal husbandry is progressing steadily under the policy of "relying on working herdsmen, uniting all forces that can be united, and gradually completing socialist transformation on the basis of stabilizing and developing production," and certain achievements have been made. In 1956, a new surge in production appeared, with agriculture achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest. Animal husbandry production in pastoral areas has also seen significant development, fully demonstrating the superiority of socialism. The construction of the Baotou industrial base, centered on the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex, the forest industry construction in the Greater Khingan Mountains, and railway and other transportation undertakings have all made significant achievements, which has further promoted the great development of the autonomous region's entire economic and cultural undertakings.

Of course, there are still shortcomings and errors in our work, manifested as subjectivism in thinking and bureaucracy in work. We must strive to overcome these and further improve the various construction tasks in the autonomous region.

Here, I would like to give the conference a brief report on the progress of the socialist transformation of the animal husbandry economy in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

Judging from the progress of the socialist transformation of animal husbandry in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, it is basically healthy and normal. There are already 543 animal husbandry production cooperatives in the region, with 18,526 herdsmen households participating, accounting for 21.91% of the total number of herdsmen households. In addition, 59,679 herdsmen households are participating in various types of mutual aid teams, bringing the total number of herdsmen households participating in cooperatives and teams to 83% of the total. Pilot projects for the socialist transformation of the herds-owner (Bayan) economy have also been carried out, with 29 Bayan households organized to establish 13 joint-venture ranches on a trial basis, and 19 individual Bayan households have been absorbed into cooperatives.

We still lack experience in the socialist transformation of animal husbandry, and the problems in our work need further study and resolution. However, cooperative animal husbandry has already shown its great superiority. According to the conditions in the Inner Mongolia pastoral areas, this superiority is particularly evident in the following aspects:

1. Most animal husbandry cooperatives have increased production and increased the income of their members. Well-managed cooperatives are able to increase the income of all members. Most cooperatives have achieved the effect of increased livestock reproduction, high survival rates, and low mortality rates. Many animal husbandry cooperatives have implemented the policy of focusing on animal husbandry while developing diversified operations, not only doing a good job in animal husbandry but also increasing agricultural and sideline income. According to surveys, more than 90% of the cooperatives increased production compared to 1955, and 89% of the members increased their income compared to 1955. According to a survey of 151 cooperatives in Zhaowuda League, Hulunbuir League, Ulanqab League, and Yikezhao League, 139 cooperatives increased production, 10 cooperatives maintained the same level, and only 2 cooperatives actually reduced production, accounting for only 1.33%. Among them, the income situation of 1,291 members of 37 cooperatives was as follows: 1,155 households increased income, 16 households maintained the same level, and 120 households actually reduced production, accounting for 9.29%. The income of cooperative members is generally 10% to 30% higher than that of mutual aid team members and individual herdsmen. Some members have increased their income by more than double compared to when they worked independently. For example, the income of Qilin, a member of the Alatengduxi Animal Husbandry Cooperative in the Right Rear Banner of Chahar, increased from 140 yuan to 600 yuan, an increase of 328%.

2. Solved the current difficulty of insufficient labor in pastoral areas. In recent years, livestock in pastoral areas has developed rapidly, and a shortage of labor has already emerged. After the establishment of animal husbandry production cooperatives, livestock are managed uniformly, and labor is allocated uniformly. This solves the difficulty of insufficient labor, improves feeding and management techniques, allows livestock to be grazed in separate groups, and allows pastures to be used in rotation according to plan. This creates extremely favorable conditions for resisting natural disasters and further developing animal husbandry. For example, in the Wulantoya Animal Husbandry Cooperative in Ongniud Banner, Zhaomeng League, 15 laborers used to not participate in production year-round but hired laborers to graze livestock. After the establishment of the cooperative, these 15 laborers all participated in production, and no laborers were hired. Because the difficulty of insufficient labor was solved, the past practice of grazing livestock by the heavens and leaving it to fate was changed to specialized grazing, resulting in more livestock reproduction, higher survival rates, and lower mortality rates. A survey of 74 cooperatives in Ongniud Banner showed that the reproduction rate of cattle, horses, and sheep was 18% to 36% higher than in 1955, and the survival rate of young livestock increased from 89.1% in 1955 to 95.5% in 1956.

3. Animal husbandry production cooperatives have carried out basic construction for animal husbandry production, such as building water conservancy projects, constructing sheds and pens, opening up new pastures, cultivating and improving existing pastures, and purchasing large-scale and new-style animal husbandry production tools, all of which are difficult for individual herdsmen to achieve. For example, the animal husbandry cooperatives in Ongniud Banner, Zhaomeng League, actively dug 276 new wells and repaired old wells in just one year in 1956. The Right Banner of Bairin built 19,611 sheds and pens.

4. Created conditions for diversified operations. Many animal husbandry production cooperatives have begun to grow feed and engage in various sideline productions, which is of great significance for the development of the animal husbandry economy in pastoral areas and for increasing the income of cooperative members. The opening up of feed bases will gradually solve the supply problem of feed and grain in pastoral areas. Historical experience has proven that animal husbandry without agricultural support is not easy to develop, and even if it develops, it cannot be consolidated. The opening up of feed bases has created a good start for the stable development of animal husbandry in pastoral areas. In 1956, animal husbandry cooperatives planted 167,000 mu of feed bases, harvesting a lot of feed, grain, and vegetables. Among them, the Jinxing Animal Husbandry Cooperative of 22 households in Junwang Banner, Yimeng League, alone opened up 2,200 mu of feed base. Animal husbandry cooperatives in Bairin Right Banner, Zhaomeng League, earned 171,066 yuan in two months from sideline productions such as transportation and hunting.

5. Created conditions for settling nomadic life. Settling down facilitates the development of animal husbandry production, and it also allows for the planting of vegetables and trees, improves living conditions, facilitates cultural and health activities, and is conducive to the prosperity of both people and livestock. In 1956, Xilingol League completed the trial construction of 16 animal husbandry cooperatives, most of which have settled down.

6. Conducive to improving production technology and carrying out breed improvement and veterinary disease prevention work. During the one-year production activities, the animal husbandry cooperatives in Ongniud Banner, Zhaomeng League, improved 8,700 sheep and 235 cattle. In Yimeng League, where internal and external parasitic diseases were more serious in the past, as a result of more than 90% of the herdsmen organizing to participate in cooperatives and mutual aid teams, the deworming work of 2 million livestock was quickly completed, eliminating parasitic diseases that year and ensuring the safety of livestock.

Although we have achieved great results in the socialist transformation of animal husbandry last year, there are still many shortcomings. Among them, the prominent problem is that the principle of profit distribution and the policy of mutual benefit for cooperatives have not been grasped firmly enough. In some places, labor remuneration is too high, and livestock share remuneration is too low. Some cadres and the masses have egalitarian ideas of "cutting fat to make up for thin," which puts households with more livestock at a disadvantage. At the same time, a few cooperatives do not pay enough attention to labor remuneration, which reduces the income of poor herdsmen. Some cadres have a mentality of greed for big, much, and high. Some cooperatives have too strict restrictions on retained livestock. Many cooperatives do not grasp production tightly enough and have chaotic management. At the same time, there is a tendency to neglect the leadership of mutual aid teams.

The above situation shows that the achievements of cooperation are the main and basic aspects. Its superiority is beyond doubt. The facts of animal husbandry cooperation also prove once again that what Chairman Mao pointed out as early as 1943—that organizing is the only way for the masses to be liberated and the only way to transform from poverty to wealth—is a true truth and the only way for ethnic minorities to transform from backwardness and poverty to advancement and prosperity. As long as we pay attention to overcoming subjectivism and bureaucracy in our work, work diligently and frugally, and under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, we will definitely be able to do a good job in the socialist transformation of animal husbandry and other construction tasks in the autonomous region, and work hard together with the people of all ethnic groups across the country to build our country into a great socialist motherland!

    合作化的优越性无可怀疑
    吉雅泰谈内蒙古畜牧业社会主义改造的成就
    我完全同意和拥护毛泽东主席在最高国务会议上的指示、周恩来总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告和陈叔通副主席关于政协常委会的工作报告，我们一定通过内蒙古自治区的各项工作，在各族各界群众中贯彻执行。
    内蒙古自治区在中国共产党、毛主席伟大民族政策的光辉照耀下，几年来各项经济及文化建设事业均得到发展，各族人民的社会主义觉悟和社会主义积极性空前高涨，民族团结更加加强，各族人民的物质和文化生活水平也有了很大提高。
    随着全国社会主义革命高潮的到来和胜利，内蒙古自治区也进入了社会主义革命高潮并取得决定性的胜利。对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造已经基本完成；牧业的社会主义改造，正在“依靠劳动牧民，团结一切可能团结的力量，在稳定发展生产的基础上，逐步完成社会主义改造”的方针下，稳步进行着，并取得了一定成绩。1956年出现了新的生产高涨，农业生产获得空前丰收；牧区畜牧业生产也有重大发展，充分显示了社会主义的优越性。以包头钢铁联合企业为中心的包头工业基地建设，大兴安岭的森林工业建设，以及铁路和其他交通事业，都取得了重大成就，这就更加促进了自治区整个经济、文化事业的大发展。
    当然，在我们的工作中还存在着缺点和错误，表现为思想上的主观主义和工作中的官僚主义，对此，必须努力克服，进一步做好自治区各项建设工作。
    在这里，我想把内蒙古自治区对畜牧业经济进行社会主义改造工作的情况，向大会做一简要的汇报。
    内蒙古自治区对畜牧业社会主义改造工作，从进展的情况来看，基本上是健康的和正常的。全区已有畜牧业生产合作社五百四十三个，入社牧民一万八千五百二十六户，占总牧户的21.91％。再加上参加各类互助组的五万九千六百七十九户牧民，参加社组的牧户已占总牧户的83％。对牧主（巴音）经济的社会主义改造，也分别进行了试点工作，组织了二十九户巴音试办了十三处合营牧场，个别吸收了十九户巴音参加了合作社。
    我们对畜牧业社会主义改造工作还缺乏经验，工作中的问题还需要进一步研究解决。但合作化了的牧业已显示出它的极大的优越性，根据内蒙牧区情况，突出的表现在下述几个方面：
    ⒈大部分牧业社增加了生产，增加了社员收入。办得好的合作社能够作到使所有社员都增加收入。大部分社收到牲畜繁殖多、成活率高、死亡少的效果。不少牧业社执行了以牧为主发展多种经营的方针，不但畜牧业搞得好，还增加了农、副业收入。根据调查，90％以上的社都比1955年增产，89％的社员都比1955年增加了收入。据昭乌达、呼伦贝尔、乌兰察布、伊克昭等盟一百五十一个社的调查，增产社一百三十九个，不增不减社十个，实际减产社二个，仅占1.33％。其中三十七个社一千二百九十一户社员的收入情况是：增加收入的一千一百五十五户，不增不减的十六户，实际减产的一百二十户，占9.29％。社员收入一般都比互助组员和个体牧民多10％到30％。有些社员比单干时增加了一倍多的收入，察右后旗阿拉腾都喜牧业社社员奇林的收入由过去的一百四十元增至六百元，即增328％。
    ⒉解决了目前牧区劳动力不足的困难。几年来牧区牲畜发展很快，已经出现了劳力不足的情况，成立畜牧业生产合作社后，牲畜统一经营，劳力统一调配，这样就解决了劳力不足的困难，改进了饲养管理技术，牲畜可以分群放牧，牧场也可以有计划地轮流使用，对于抵御自然灾害和进一步发展畜牧业创造了极为有利的条件。例如昭盟翁牛特旗乌兰托雅牧业社，过去有十五个劳力常年不参加生产，而雇工放牧。建社后，这十五个劳力都参加了生产，不雇工了。由于解决了劳力不足的困难，改变了过去的天牧、了牧为专人放牧，因而牲畜繁殖多，成活多，死亡少。翁牛特旗七十四个社的调查，牛马羊的繁殖率比1955年高18％到36％，幼畜成活率由1955年的89.1％提高到1956年的95.5％。
    ⒊畜牧业生产合作社进行了畜牧业生产的基本建设，如兴修水利、搭盖棚圈、开辟新的牧场、培育和改良现有牧场、购置大型和新式的畜牧业生产工具等，这都是个体牧民所难以作到的。例如昭盟翁牛特旗的牧业社1956年一年中就积极打新井和修旧井二百七十六眼。巴林右旗搭盖棚圈一万九千六百十一座。
    ⒋为多种经营创造了条件。很多畜牧业生产合作社开始种植了饲料，和进行各种副业生产，这对于牧区畜牧业经济的发展和增加社员收入，具有很大意义。饲料基地的开辟，将会逐步地解决牧区饲料和粮食的供应问题。历史经验证明，没有农业支援的牧业是不易发展的，发展了也是巩固不了的，而饲料基地的开辟即为牧区畜牧业的稳定发展创造了良好开端。1956年牧业社种植饲料基地十六万七千亩，收获了很多的饲料、粮食和蔬菜。其中仅伊盟郡王旗二十二户的金星牧业社就开辟了饲料基地二千二百亩。昭盟巴林右旗牧业社跑运输、打猎等副业生产在两个月里就收入十七万一千零六十六元。
    ⒌为定居游牧创造了条件。定居后就便于发展畜牧业生产，还可以种植蔬菜和林木，改进居住条件，便于进行文化卫生活动，有利于人畜两旺。锡盟1956年试建成十六个牧业社，这些牧业社大部分都定居了下来。
    ⒍有利于改进生产技术和进行品种改良和兽疫防治工作。昭盟翁牛特旗的牧业社在一年的生产活动当中，改良羊八千七百只，改良牛二百三十五头。过去内外寄生虫病较严重的伊盟，由于90％以上的牧民组织起来参加社、互助组的结果，很快就完成了二百万头牲畜的驱虫工作，消灭了当年的寄生虫病，保证了牲畜的安全。
    我们在去年畜牧业社会主义改造中，虽然获得了很大成绩，也还存在着许多缺点。其中突出的问题是对合作社收益分配的原则和互利政策掌握得不够稳。有些地方劳动报酬偏高，畜股报酬偏低；某些干部和群众中有“割肥补瘦”的平均主义思想，使畜多户吃亏。同时，也有少数社对劳动报酬照顾不够，使贫困牧民减少收入。在部分干部中有贪大、贪多、贪高的情绪；有些社自留牲畜偏紧；有不少合作社对生产抓得不紧，经营管理混乱；同时有忽视对互助组领导的倾向。
    从上述情况说明了合作化的成绩是主要的、基本的。其优越性是无可怀疑的。通过牧业合作化的事实也再一次说明了毛主席早在1943年就指出的：组织起来是人民群众得到解放的必由之路、由穷变富的必由之路是千真万确的真理，也是少数民族由落后、穷困变为先进、富裕的唯一道路。只要我们注意克服工作中的主观主义和官僚主义，兢兢业业，克勤克俭，在党和政府正确领导下，一定可以做好自治区牧业社会主义改造工作和其他各项建设工作，与全国各族人民一起，为将我国建设成为一个社会主义的伟大祖国而艰苦奋斗！
    不妥之处，请批评指正。
