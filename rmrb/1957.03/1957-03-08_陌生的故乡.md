　　The Unfamiliar Hometown
　　Shí Zhuàngwén

　　After receiving the admission notice from the Renmin University of China, I was so happy that I almost forgot to eat and sleep. Before the start of the semester, I decided to go home and take a look. I hadn't been home for three years, and I was so eager to get there!

　　Early in the morning, the train arrived at Laibin. The stop was long, so I asked someone to look after my luggage and got off the train to take a look at Laibin city. Perhaps it was too early, there were only a few stalls selling breakfast noodles and some fresh vegetables brought in from the countryside, nothing else. Walking further in, I saw a stretch of newly built houses. I strolled along, looking around, and repeatedly walked into dead ends and then turned back. A young man thought I was lost and approached me kindly asking, "Comrade, who are you looking for?"

　　The young man heard from my answer that I was a Zhuang person, and he started chatting with me in Zhuang language: "Look, Laibin has changed a lot, right? Now it's the intersection of the Laihe Railway and the Xianggui Railway, and small ships can travel on the Hongshui River. It's also the coal capital of Guangxi, and I heard recently that there's some manganese mine too!" Seeing that I was only paying attention to the new houses, he enthusiastically said: "The houses up there are even better, and a complete middle school was established here this year..." The train whistle sounded.

　　The train went from Laibin to Taheshan Coal Mine, and at Baihe'ai Station, I and a few friends quickly ate a bowl of rice noodles at the store. After getting on the train, two carriages were already crowded with a group of young people, many of whom were wearing red scarves, chattering noisily. I thought: These young people are probably middle school students from the city visiting the Taheshan Coal Mine? A little girl politely stood up and said in Guangxi dialect with a Zhuang accent: "Comrade, is this your seat? I put your things under the seat." I shook my head. Only then did I notice that these young people were wearing badges of "Laibin No. 2 Middle School". They were all speaking Zhuang language, joking and laughing. I suddenly remembered being ridiculed for speaking Zhuang language in the past. I pulled a Young Pioneer and asked: "When you study at school, are there many people who speak Zhuang language? Does anyone laugh at those who speak Zhuang language?" He laughed, as if I had asked something ridiculous. He straightened his red scarf and said: "There are many classmates from the countryside in our class, and everyone speaks Zhuang language. Only a few classmates from the city don't know how to speak Zhuang language, and they even learn Zhuang language from us. The teachers also often speak Zhuang language with us!" A young man standing next to him added: "Now we are promoting the Zhuang language, and soon we will establish a Zhuang language school here. Who will laugh at speaking Zhuang language!"

　　The train arrived at the terminal station - Lilang. After the group of middle school students got off the train, they left as if they were flying. I had a lot of luggage, so after packing my load, they were almost all gone, leaving only two little girls. I didn't recognize one, and the other seemed a little familiar, but I couldn't remember who she was. Seeing me looking at her, she suddenly asked: "Aren't you Zhuangwen? You're back! Let's go together!" Hearing her voice, I remembered that she was Wei Caifeng from our village. I was very surprised: How did this rural shepherd girl also go to middle school! After introductions, I learned that the other girl was Pan Cailian from a village not far from ours. I couldn't help but praise: "You are really great! In the past, we had never even seen female classmates who went to senior primary school in this area, but you actually passed the entrance exam to middle school. You are so lucky!" We walked and talked. After the main road ended, there was a stretch of new houses, the roaring of machines and the whiffs of stinky coal gas, were so unfamiliar to me. When I left my hometown, this was still a wilderness, but now it is a noisy mine with roaring machines and the sound of people!

　　Soon after I arrived home, the villagers all ran over to see me. They knew that I had been admitted to the Renmin University of China, and they congratulated my parents one after another. An old lady said to my mother: "In the old society, you couldn't even afford a bowl of thin porridge, how could the children have money to study? Now your son can also study in Beijing. We didn't even dare to dream of such a good life before." An old man said: "This place has changed a lot. In the past, who had ever seen what electric lights and trains looked like? Now we have seen them all. I heard that we are also preparing to build a hydroelectric power station in Guwang. Some people say that we also have manganese mines and iron mines here. When these mines are developed, this place will be lively..."

    陌生的故乡
    石壮文
    得到录取中国人民大学的通知后，我几乎乐得废寝忘食。趁没有开学，我决定先回家看看。三年不回家了，我是多么想快些到家呀！
    清晨，车到来宾。这站停车时间较长，我托人照顾行李，下车到来宾市看一看。大概来得太早了，市场上只有几家卖早点的粉摊和一些刚从乡下挑来的青菜，别的什么也没有。再往里走，一眼望去是一片新起的房子。我信步走去，东张西望，几次走进死巷又转回来。一位青年以为我走迷了路，走近我好心好意地问：“同志，你找谁？”
    那青年人从我的答话中听出我是僮族人，他用僮话和我攀谈起来：“你看，来宾变了样子吧？如今它是来睦铁路和湘桂铁路的交点，红水河可通小轮船。它又是广西的煤都，最近听说还有什么锰矿呢！”他见我只注意那些新房子，便热心地说：“上边的房子更好，今年这里还成立一所完全中学……”火车的汽笛响了。
    车从来宾转塔合山煤矿，到白鹤隘车站，我和几位朋友到商店去赶快吃了一碗米粉。等上车后，两个车厢已经挤满了一帮青少年，有不少人还带着红领巾，吱吱喳喳地叫喊。我想：这群年轻人大概是城里的中学生去塔合山煤矿参观的吧？一位小姑娘很有礼貌地站起来，用夹僮音的广西话说道：“同志，是你坐在这里吗？你的东西我放在座位底下去了。”我摇摇头。这时才看见这群年轻人的胸前佩戴着“来宾二中”的徽章。他们都说僮话，嘻嘻哈哈地在开玩笑。我忽然想起过去说僮话被人奚落的事情，我拉了一位少先队员问道：“你们在学校里读书，说僮话的人多不多？说僮话是否有人笑话？”他笑起来，好像我问的是什么可笑的事情，他整一整红领巾说：“我们班乡下的同学多，大家都说僮话，只有几个城里的同学不会说僮话，他们还向我们学僮话，老师们也常和我们说僮话呢！”旁边站着的一位青年补充道：“现在正在推广僮族文字呢，不久我们这里就要成立僮文学校，说僮话还有谁笑话！”
    火车到了终点站——里栏，那帮初中学生下车后飞也似地走了。我行李较多，等装好担子后，他们差不多快走光了，只剩下两位小姑娘。有一位我不认识，一位好像有点面熟，但想不起她是谁。她见我望着她，忽然问道：“你不是壮文吗？你回来啦！我们一起走吧！”听到她的声音，我才想起她是我们村的韦彩凤。我十分惊讶：怎么这位农村牧童姑娘也上中学了！经过介绍，我才知道另一位姑娘是离我们村不远的盘彩莲。我不禁连声称赞：“你们真不错！过去我们这地方连上高小的女同学都没见过，你们竟考上中学了，你们真幸福！”我们边走边说，大路走完后，是一片新房子，轰隆轰隆的机器声和一股股的臭煤气，对我是这么陌生。我离开故乡时，这里还是一片荒野，如今这里已经是机器轰响，人声嘈杂的矿场了！
    我到家不久，乡亲们都跑来看我，他们知道我考上了中国人民大学，纷纷向我父母亲道喜。一位老太太对我母亲说：“在旧社会你们连一碗稀粥都吃不上，孩子们那里有钱读书，现在你的儿子也能到北京读书，这样的好日子以前连想都不敢想。”一位老人说：“我们这里可大变样子了，以前我们谁见过电灯、火车是什么样？现在都看见了。听说还准备在古旺建立水电站呢。有人说我们这里还有锰矿、铁矿，这些矿要开发起来，我们这里才热闹呢……。”
