One Should See the Positive Factors
By Our Correspondent Jin Yukun

Editor's Note: This year's Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement has the experience of past Increase Production and Practice Economy Movements, as well as the experience of Advanced Producers' Movements. The broad masses of workers have also accumulated considerable experience in years of production practice. We must fully estimate and utilize these positive factors, deeply develop the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, and strive to comprehensively overfulfill the state plan. It is incorrect to negate the achievements already made in the past, or to exaggerate certain shortcomings in past work, or even to adopt a skeptical attitude towards the fundamental line of mobilizing the masses. The experience and lessons of the Fuxin Mine in formulating this year's production plan fully illustrate this point.

The Fuxin Mining Bureau was initially planning for a decline in key indicators when they began formulating this year's production plan.

Initially, the Ministry of Coal Industry required a production target of 7.1 million tons, but later, at the suggestion of the bureau, the number was revised to 6.9 million tons. Last year, Fuxin Mine's annual output was 6.85 million tons. The planned number seems slightly higher than last year, but if the 250,000 tons of output from the Ping'an Vertical Shaft, which went into production this year, is deducted, the output of the original mines actually decreased by 200,000 tons. Regarding cost indicators, the ministry allowed an overspending of 4.08% compared to last year, while the bureau determined a target of 4.54% overspending. The increase in cost, in addition to the increased stripping and tunneling this year, is related to the Ping'an Vertical Shaft just starting production (costs are inevitably higher) and the decrease in output. Therefore, the overall trend of this year's plan is: decreased output and increased costs.

This created the illusion that this year would be easier. The plan for this year was already lower than the actual production capacity and lower than last year's targets. However, not a single mine was able to formulate a plan according to the targets. The first balance across the entire mining area resulted in a shortfall of 200,000 tons in output, and the cost indicators were even further off. The four mines together would overspend by more than 17 million yuan, four times the original target. Xinqiu Mine requested an overspending of 8.09 million yuan. Haizhou Open-pit Mine also requested an overspending of 5.16 million yuan. Last year, the efficiency of each production worker was 1.336 tons, and this year the bureau set a target of 1.19 tons, already lower than last year, but the mines could only accept 1.11 tons. It almost turned into a situation of asking for the sky-high price, with endless arguments and stalemates.

However, things are always moving forward. Trying to solve contradictions with passive retreat will only make the contradictions more complex, and leadership work will become more passive.

The huge figure of 17 million yuan in overspending was clearly unacceptable to the state. What to do? Concessions could not solve the problem, so they had to go deeper, investigate, and mobilize the masses to get their thinking straight. Thus, under the leadership of the municipal party committee, they drew more than 80 people from the leading organs of the mining area to form four working groups to go deep into the masses and consult with them.

As soon as the working groups went down, they discovered many kinds of conservative ideas: "Last year, we 'rushed,' so this year we must be 'steady'!" "The reason for 'rushing' last year was that mobilizing the masses led to 'rushing.'" "The opinions of the masses have no scientific basis, and the methods are not sufficiently reliable. 'Rushing' will be uncontrollable! Therefore, there is no need to mobilize the masses." Some even questioned: "Whether the Advanced Producers' Movement should continue to be carried out is also worth considering." Since the masses are not "reliable" and the mass movement is even more "unreliable," some simply understood "sufficiently reliable" as "more people, more money, and more materials." Therefore, when formulating the plan, they rarely or dared not estimate favorable factors such as promoting advanced experience and improving technical levels. They even believed that emphasizing favorable factors was "exaggerating subjective initiative and ignoring objective development laws."

Due to a passive understanding of "reliable" and an overemphasis on unfavorable factors, the safety factor was inevitably increased. According to the Geology Section of Xinqiu Mine: the plan for the third road of the second inclined shaft of the fourth pit only had one coal seam, but in fact, there were five mineable coal seams. The plan stated that this coal seam was only two meters thick, but in reality, it was four to eight meters thick. The plan for the first inclined shaft of the first pit was for three seams, but in reality, there were four to seven seams. There was also a mine that always included a thin coal seam in its annual plan, but never mined it, because they regarded it as an "unfavorable factor" to deal with superiors.

This situation was not isolated. When the Haizhou Open-pit Mine was making plans for explosives consumption (explosives are a major item in the cost of open-pit mining), the overspending was as high as 1.26 million yuan. According to the working group's preliminary investigation, nearly 200 tons of explosives could actually be saved. Simply by loading a little less in each hole, about 36 tons of explosives could be saved throughout the year.

If the idea of "sufficiently reliable" is separated from the principle of doing everything possible to increase production and practice economy, it can only be used as a shield for conservative ideas. Xinqiu Mine's planned output for this year is lower than last year. Last year, the output of its two open-pit mines was 1.31 million tons, but this year's plan is only 960,000 tons (there are indeed some changes in conditions). According to a deputy director, if more methods are considered, it can be said that it is entirely possible for the entire mine to reach last year's output level. It is said that Xinqiu Mine has such a pattern every year: the open-pit output is always set very low when making the plan at the beginning of the year, but the actual completion is greatly exceeded, in order to compensate for the incomplete plan of the inclined shaft. They call it relying on "heaven" (open pit) for food. This year, it cannot be said that this idea is completely absent. The actual planned output of the Haizhou Open-pit Mine this year is also lower than last year, which is certainly affected by the fact that the stripping volume last year did not complete the plan. This mine has a high degree of mechanized production, but the utilization rate of machinery is surprisingly low. Taking electric shovels as an example, the average utilization rate last year was only 41%, and the actual operating time was very short. However, the utilization rate of old electric shovels in the North Open-pit of Xinqiu Mine generally reaches 60% or 80%. It is difficult to imagine that there is no potential to be tapped here.

In addition, the potential for increasing production on the spoil heaps of the Haizhou Open-pit Mine is also very large. Here, 2-3 million tons of miscellaneous coal (containing 20%-40% coal) are discarded every year. If it is all recovered, 550,000 tons of raw coal can be obtained annually. This is equivalent to the annual output of a large vertical shaft with an investment of 40,000 yuan and several years of construction. However, only a very small portion of the miscellaneous coal in the spoil heaps is currently recovered manually. It is estimated that more than 2 million tons of raw coal may have been discarded since the handover of production, and the loss is incalculable. If active measures are taken recently, most of the discarded coal can be reasonably recovered. One of the active measures is to improve the equipment utilization rate of the Haizhou Open-pit Mine coal washing plant, and to replace water washing with manual selection for some of the better quality coal (for public and employee coal), leaving some water washing capacity for miscellaneous coal recovery washing. Doing so will not require any state investment and can increase the output of raw coal by 170,000 tons. The second measure is to appropriately invest in restoring a coal washing plant and adding equipment to another coal washing plant, which can recover another 140,000 tons of raw coal. In addition, more than 100,000 tons can be recovered manually in the spoil heaps, which can increase the production of raw coal by more than 400,000 tons and save several million yuan. From this one thing alone, we can see the great potential and profit of the coal mine.

The conservative thinking this year is more prominent than in previous years, which is inseparable from the lack of a correct estimate of last year's achievements and shortcomings. Reducing achievements and exaggerating shortcomings will also bring adverse negative effects to practical work. Did last year really "rush"? Was the mobilization of the masses wrong? At the enlarged meeting of the municipal party committee, these confused thoughts were clarified. The main indicators of last year's plan have been overfulfilled. It can be affirmed that the plan discussed by the masses is basically reliable and realistic. Taking Ping'an Mine as an example: the initial plan was for an annual output of 920,000 tons, which was increased to 1 million tons after discussion by the masses, and the actual completion was 1.03 million tons. If we must say "rush," it is only a problem with individual indicators, such as forcibly limiting the time to promote a certain experience without asking about specific conditions, and blindly disrupting the normal production order, which affects safety and quality. It is certainly wrong not to correct these shortcomings. But from the whole point of view, these problems are only local and temporary. In fact, the units that completed the tasks better last year were precisely the units that mobilized the masses and promoted advanced experience better. The original auxiliary material plan of Gaode Mine was to increase by 92% compared to last year. After discussion by veteran workers, team leaders, etc., the original planned number was cut in half, which was 5% lower than last year's number. The original plan of Xinqiu Mine was to overspend 4 million yuan on materials, which was reduced to 2 million yuan after discussion. In the discussion, the technical personnel of Xinqiu Fifth Pit improved the technical design, which can increase the production of 30,000 tons of coal this year. Similar examples are common in various mines.

As a result of mobilizing the masses to tap potential, the bureau's output plan for this year has increased from 6.9 million tons to 7.14 million tons. The contradiction between cost and efficiency decline has also been basically resolved, and the indicators can also approach the requirements. According to estimates by the person in charge of the municipal party committee, it is possible to reach an output of 7.3 million to 7.4 million tons if more measures are taken.

    应当看到积极因素
    本报记者　金雨困
    编者按：今年开展增产节约运动，有过去增产节约的经验，也有先进生产者运动的经验；广大职工群众在多年的生产实际中，也已经积累了不少的经验；我们必须充分地估计和发挥这些积极因素，深入地开展增产节约运动，争取全面地超额完成国家计划。如果否定过去已经取得的成绩，或者夸大过去工作中的某些缺点，甚至对于发动群众这一根本路线采取怀疑态度，都是不对的。阜新矿制订今年生产计划的经验教训，就充分说明了这一点。
    阜新矿务局在开始制订今年生产计划的时候，一些主要指标都是后退的。
    最早，煤炭工业部要求的产量指标是七百一十万吨，后来由于局里的建议，下达的数字又改为六百九十万吨。去年阜新矿的年产量是六百八十五万吨，计划数似乎略高于去年，但是如果扣除了今年投入生产的平安竖井二十五万吨的产量，实际上原有矿井的产量下降了二十万吨。成本指标，部里允许较去年超支4.08％，局里确定的指标是超支4.54％。成本的提高，除了今年剥离量和掘进量增加外，与平安竖井刚投入生产（成本必然较高）和产量下降都有若干关系。因此今年计划总的趋势：产量下降、成本上升。
    这样一来，给人留下了一种错觉：今年可以松松气了。本来今年的计划就低于实际生产能力、低于去年的指标，可是，仍然没有一个矿能够按照指标制订计划。第一次全矿区平衡的结果，产量差二十万吨，成本指标距离更大，四个矿共要超支一千七百多万元，为原来指标的四倍。新丘矿要求超支八百零九万元。海州露天矿也要求超支五百一十六万元。去年每个生产工人的效率是一点三三六吨，今年局确定指标是一点一九吨，已较去年为低，但矿里只能接受一点一一吨。几乎形成了漫天要价的局势，争争吵吵相持不下。
    然而事物总是往前发展的。要想以消极的后退来解决矛盾，结果会使矛盾更复杂，领导工作也就更加陷于被动。
    要超支一千七百万元的巨大数字，显然国家是无法接受这样的指标的。怎么办呢？迁就已经无法解决问题，只有深入下去，调查研究，发动群众，打通思想了。于是他们在市委的领导下，从矿区领导机关抽调了八十多人，组成四个工作组，深入到群众中去同群众商量。
    工作组一下去，就发现了不少形形色色的保守思想：“去年是‘冒’了，今年一定要搞得‘稳’一点”！ “去年所以‘冒’，是发动群众发‘冒’了”。“群众的意见无科学根据，办法也不充分可靠，‘冒’了就不可收拾！因此发动群众没有必要”。有的甚至怀疑：“先进生产者运动是否继续开展也值得考虑”。既然群众不“可靠”，群众运动更“不可靠”，有的就把“充分可靠”简单地理解为“人多、钱多、材料多”。因此在编制计划时，对于推广先进经验提高技术水平等有利因素，就很少或不敢把它估计进去。甚至认为强调有利因素就是“夸大了主观能动性，忽视了客观发展规律”。
    由于消极地理解了“可靠”，又过于强调了不利因素，这样就必然增大了保险系数。据新丘矿地质科反映：四坑二斜井三路计划上只有一层煤，实际上可采的有五层煤，计划上这一层煤只有二公尺厚，实际上有四公尺到八公尺厚。一坑一斜井计划上是三层，实际上是四层到七层。还有一个矿年年作计划，总要把一块薄煤层列上去，但是年年都不去采它，原来是他们把它当作“不利因素”对付上级的。
    这种情况并不是个别的。海州露天矿在作火药消耗计划的时候（火药是露天矿成本中的主要项目），要超支一百二十六万元之多。据工作组初步摸了摸，实际上可节约的火药将近二百吨；只要每个眼少装一点，全年就可节省炸药三十六吨左右。
    “充分可靠”的思想如果离开了想尽一切办法、千方百计增产节约的方针，那它就只能作为保守思想的挡箭牌。新丘矿今年的计划产量低于去年，所属两个露天矿去年产量是一百三十一万吨，但今年的计划仅达九十六万吨（条件上确有一些变化）。据一位副局长谈：如果多想些办法，可以这样说，全矿要达到去年的产量水平是完全可能的。据说，新丘矿每年都有这样的规律，年初作计划时露天产量总是压得很低，而实际完成时又大量超额，以此来弥补斜井的完不成计划，他们称之谓靠“天”（露天）吃饭。今年这种思想恐怕不能说已经没有。海州露天矿今年实际计划产量也低于去年，这固然与去年剥离量没有完成计划有一定的影响。这个矿是高度机械化的生产，但机械的利用率却低得惊人。以电铲为例，去年平均利用率仅达41％，实际的作业时间很少。而新丘矿北露天的旧电铲一般利用率都达到60％或80％。人们很难想像这里是无潜力可挖的。
    此外，海州露天矿的排土场上增产潜力同样是很大的。在这里，每年丢弃的杂煤有二、三百万吨（含煤率20％到40％），如果把它全部回收，每年可取得原煤五十五万吨。即相当于一个投资四万、建设数年的大型竖井的年产量。但是目前排土场的杂煤仅有极小部分是用手工捡回的。据估计，从移交生产以来丢弃的原煤可能在二百万吨以上，损失是无法计算的。如果最近采取积极措施的话，就能使大部丢弃的煤炭得到合理回收。积极措施之一是提高海州露天矿选煤厂设备利用率，并将一部分质量较好的煤由人工挑选代替水洗（供公用煤和职工用煤），留出一部水洗能力让给杂煤回收洗用。这样做，不需国家任何投资，即可增产十七万吨原煤。第二条措施是适当投资恢复一个选煤厂和为另一个选煤厂增加设备，又可回收原煤十四万吨。再加上在排土场用手工回收十多万吨，就可增产原煤四十多万吨，并节约数百万元。仅就这一件事，也可以看到煤矿潜力之大、油水之多。
    今年的保守思想所以较往年为突出，这与对去年的成绩和缺点缺乏正确的估计是分不开的。缩小成绩夸大缺点也会给实际工作带来不利的消极影响。去年究竟是不是冒了？群众是不是发动错了？在市委扩大会议上，这些混乱思想得到了澄清。去年的计划各项主要指标都已超额完成，可以肯定经过群众讨论的计划基本上是可靠的也是切合实际的。以平安矿为例：最初计划年产九十二万吨，群众讨论后为一百万吨，实际完成为一百零三万吨。如果一定要说“冒”，也仅是个别指标的问题，如不问具体条件，硬性限期推广某项经验，以及盲目打乱正常生产秩序而影响安全和质量。不纠正这些缺点当然是错误的。但从整个看来这些问题毕竟是局部的和暂时的。事实上去年完成任务较好的单位，也正是发动群众推广先进经验较好的单位。高德矿原来辅助材料计划要比去年提高92％，经老工人、班长等讨论后，就将原计划数字削减了一半。比去年的数字降低5％。新丘矿原来计划材料超支四百万元，经讨论后减到二百万元。在讨论中新丘五坑技术人员改进技术设计，今年即可增产三万吨煤。类似事例各矿都不少。
    发动群众挖掘潜力的结果，全局今年的产量计划已由六百九十万吨增加到七百一十四万吨。成本和效率下降的矛盾也就基本解决，指标也能接近要求。据市委负责人估计，如果多采取些措施，达到七百三十万到七百四十万吨的产量是可能的。
