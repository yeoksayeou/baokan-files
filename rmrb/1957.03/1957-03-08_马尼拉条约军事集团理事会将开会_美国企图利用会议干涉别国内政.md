Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 7th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles revealed yesterday as he left Washington for Australia to attend the Manila Treaty Organization Council meeting that this Council meeting will "further develop" this military organization.

Dulles said on March 5th at a press conference in response to a reporter's question that although Indonesia did not participate in the Manila Treaty Organization, because it is in the Southeast Asian region, "what happens there will naturally make the member states (of the Manila Treaty Organization) feel interested and concerned." The news that the meeting will discuss the situation in Indonesia has already aroused strong protests from Indonesian public opinion.

The Manila Treaty Organization Council meeting is scheduled to be held in Canberra, the capital of Australia, starting on the 11th. Military advisors of this military organization will also hold meetings in Canberra on the 8th and 9th.

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, March 7th: The Pakistani delegation, headed by Finance Minister Amjad Ali, left Karachi today for Canberra to attend the Manila Treaty Organization Council meeting.

According to newspaper reports, Pakistan will request that the Manila Treaty Organization countries no longer encourage neutral countries through economic aid and other means.

The newspaper said that Pakistan will also demand unconditional recognition of the principle of "collective security" in the region. What it means is that if one country is attacked, all other countries must help it. This request will naturally lead to a discussion of the Kashmir issue, which Pakistan attaches great importance to.

    马尼拉条约军事集团理事会将开会
    美国企图利用会议干涉别国内政
    据新华社7日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯昨天在离开华盛顿前往澳大利亚参加马尼拉条约组织理事会会议时透露，这次理事会会议将“进一步发展”这个军事组织。
    杜勒斯5日在记者招待会上答复记者提出的问题时曾经说，尽管印度尼西亚没有参加马尼拉条约组织，但是由于它是在东南亚地区，
  “那里发生的事情自然会使（马尼拉条约组织）成员国感到兴趣和关切”。这次会议将要讨论印度尼西亚局势的消息，已经引起印度尼西亚舆论的强烈抗议。
    马尼拉条约组织理事会会议定于11日起在澳大利亚首都堪培拉举行。这个军事组织的军事顾问们也将在8日和9日在堪培拉举行会议。
    据新华社卡拉奇7日电　以财政部长阿姆贾德·阿里为首的巴基斯坦代表团今天离开卡拉奇前往堪培拉参加马尼拉条约组织理事会会议。
    据报纸报道，巴基斯坦将要求马尼拉条约组织国家不要再通过经济援助和其他方法给中立国家以鼓励。
    报纸说，巴基斯坦还将要求无条件地承认这个地区的“集体安全”的原则。它的意思就是说，如果一国遭到攻击，所有其他国家必须帮助它。这种要求自然会导致对克什米尔问题的讨论，巴基斯坦对这个问题是极为重视的。
