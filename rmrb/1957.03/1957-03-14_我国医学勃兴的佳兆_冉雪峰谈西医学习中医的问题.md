I fully support the reports made by the leaders at this conference.

Having dabbled in the medical field for fifty years, as an old practitioner of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), I would like to offer some crude opinions on the basic substance and content of TCM and the exchange between TCM and Western medicine.

TCM is the medicine of the broad masses of the Chinese people. It is closely integrated with the people and is a weapon for the people to fight against disease. It has a permanently effective history of four to five thousand years and the excellent achievement of serving a population of 600 million, which is the most in the world. It has come from long-term clinical facts and experience, and thus can reflect China's climate, geography, customs, and habits. It is precisely suited to treating the diseases of the broad masses of the Chinese people; moreover, it can flexibly apply principles and extend them to infinity. Therefore, in terms of efficacy, it often treats diseases that other medicines cannot treat, and it is a special medicine in the world of medicine.

What is the basic substance and content of TCM that we should deeply understand as learners? Generally speaking, TCM speaks of physiology as the study of life, not death; speaks of pathology as the study of the environment, not isolation; speaks of treatment as the study of the whole, not the part. Humans are in the universe and are connected with heaven and earth. Changes in heaven and earth bring about changes in the human body. Not only does the human body change, but the essence of heaven and earth also changes. TCM explores how humans and heaven and earth jointly produce. It not only speaks of production, but also of continuous production, directly seeking to have humans conquer nature. This basic substance and content of TCM is worthy of attention.

The Party and the government believe that TCM, a cultural heritage of the motherland, has value for research and development, and calls on all TCM and Western medicine practitioners in the country to learn from each other, with the focus on Western medicine learning from TCM. This instruction has penetrated the theoretical levels of TCM and Western medicine, solved the problem of separation between TCM and Western medicine, and marked the route for the integration of TCM and Western medicine. At first, Western medicine practitioners inevitably had some doubts about learning TCM, but now they are sincerely convinced and a high tide of Western medicine practitioners learning TCM is surging. Customs are changing greatly, and this is a good omen for the rise of TCM in the motherland.

However, Western medicine practitioners learning TCM should focus on the fundamentals of the discipline. If they only pay attention to experience, and only memorize a medicine, a prescription, or a disease, thinking it is simple and practical, they are actually limited to local, small achievements. That will not play a big role in the true integration of TCM and Western medicine. Moreover, Western medicine practitioners learning TCM should not only understand some basic knowledge of TCM, but should fully understand the basic knowledge of TCM, and fully understand the basic spirit of TCM, in order to prove the deepest level of TCM theory. In this way, both TCM and Western medicine can compete and shine, and jointly shoulder the glorious historical task of developing the culture of our ancestors.

Furthermore, the fundamentals of TCM and Western medicine are different, and research methods cannot be confined to one model. Therefore, scientific methods include both general methods and special methods. For the profound theory of TCM, we must strive to understand it from TCM itself, and not use the perspective of Western medicine theory to measure TCM theory. This integration of two major cultures, TCM and Western medicine, is unprecedented, extremely meticulous, and extremely difficult. Learning has no end. Now TCM and Western medicine must study together, and in the future, the eternal TCM and Western medicine must still study together. It is hoped that Western medicine practitioners learning TCM will integrate the essence of thousands of years of experimentation of TCM, which adapts to local conditions and adapts to the times, into Western medicine theory, and increase this unique raw material as a vital force. Complementing each other, its development will surely be unexpectedly great. Although the fundamentals of the discipline are different, with the efforts of both TCM and Western medicine, we can find truth from contradictions, summarize convergence from truth, and create another integration from convergence, pushing TCM to the highest peak of magnificence. Not only will it better serve the broad masses of the people of the motherland, but it will also contribute this special medicine to the world, better serving the broad masses of the people all over the world.

I myself am old and my energy is depleted. My understanding is insufficient. If there is anything inappropriate in the above, I hope all comrades will give me more guidance. (Attached picture)

    我国医学勃兴的佳兆
    冉雪峰谈西医学习中医的问题
    我完全拥护这次会议各位首长各项报告。
    我滥竽医界垂五十年，是个老中医，试就中医学术基质内容，和中西医学交流问题，聊贡一点粗浅意见。
    中医是中国广大人民自己的医，与人民亲密结合，为人民与疾病作斗争的武器，有四五千年永久有效的历史，六万万人口冠全球优美的成绩，由长期临床事实经验体合而来，故能反映出中国天时、地理、气候、风俗、习惯。用以治疗中国广大人民疾病恰恰适合；且可活用原则，通于无穷，故在疗效上，常治他医所不能治的病，为世界医学中一种的特殊医学。
    究之中医学术基质内容如何，我们为学所当深深了解，概括言：中医讲生理是讲生的，不是讲死的；讲病理是讲环境的，不是讲孤立的；讲治疗，是讲整体的，不是讲局部的。人在宇宙中，与天地息息相通，天地变化，人体即起变化，不仅人体起变化，天地本体，亦自起变化。中医究人与天地所以共同生，不宁讲生的，并讲生生的，直欲人定胜天，征服自然，这个中医学术基质内容，值得注意。
    党和政府以这个祖国文化中医，有研究发扬的价值，号召全国中西医，相互学习，重心尤放在西医学习中医上。这个指示，透过了中西医学理数层，解决了中西医隔阂的问题，标明了中西医化合的路线。起初西医学习中医免不了几分疑虑，现忳忱悦服，涌起西医学习中医的高潮，风习丕变，这就是祖国医学勃兴的佳兆。
    但是西医学习中医，要在学术根本上着眼，若单注意经验，惟记诵一药一方一病，自以为简便实在；其实囿于局部小成，那是与中西医学术真正化合上，起不了好大作用的。而且西医学习中医，不是仅懂些中医基本学识；要全懂得中医基本学识；并要全懂得中医学术基本的精神，方能证入中医学理的最深层。庶中西双方竞耀媲美，共肩起这个有历史性发扬祖国先代文化光荣的任务。
    进一步言，中西医学术基本不同，研究方法，不能局于一个式。所以科学方法，有普通方法，又有特殊方法，中医深邃学理，须向中医自身力求了解，不能以西医学理的看法，来衡量中医学理，这个中西医两大文化化合，史无前例，极细致、极艰巨，学问无止境。现在中西医须共同研究，将来永恒的中西医仍须共同研究。希望西医学习中医，将中医因地制宜，因时制宜，数千年实验精蕴，融纳入西医学理中，增加此特有原料的生力军，相得益彰，其发展必有出人意外的。学术基本虽不同，在中西医双方努力下，可由矛盾寻出真理，由真理归结会通，由会通再起一个化合，将祖国医学推到峥嵘峻极最高峰。不宁更好的为祖国广大人民服务，并将这个特殊医学贡献到世界去，更好的为全世界广大人民服务。
    我本人年事已老，精力衰敝，体会不够，以上所陈其有不合者，尚希各同志多多指正。（附图片）
