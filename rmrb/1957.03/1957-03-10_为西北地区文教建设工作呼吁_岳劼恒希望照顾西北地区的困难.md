Appealing for Cultural and Educational Construction in the Northwest Region
Yue Jieheng Hopes for Consideration of Difficulties in the Northwest Region

This time, attending the CPPCC (Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference) meeting in the capital, I listened to Chairman Mao's speech on how to correctly handle contradictions among the people and Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of several issues concerning the proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan before the meeting. During the meeting, I listened to Premier Zhou's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report of the CPPCC National Committee, and speeches by other leading comrades. I was deeply educated and inspired, and I express my complete agreement and support.

I would now like to express some opinions on the cultural and educational work in the Northwest region. Since liberation eight years ago, thanks to the correct leadership and strong support of the Party and governments at all levels, the cultural and educational work in the Northwest provinces has made tremendous progress. However, some difficulties have also emerged in the process of progress. If these are not resolved quickly, they will inevitably affect the speed of advancement. Based on the problems encountered in my work and the voices of the masses I am connected with, adhering to the principle of knowing everything and saying everything, I list the following for the conference's consideration.

	Material Supply Must Consider the Needs of Higher Education Development in the Northwest.

(1) Although the equipment of higher education institutions in the Northwest has been greatly expanded in recent years, it still cannot meet the needs of teaching and research. In addition to significant reductions in overseas purchases due to foreign exchange issues, there are also some problems with domestic purchases. Last year, various institutions purchased domestically manufactured equipment, but due to shortages in the Northwest, they sent people to Wuhan, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places to make purchases, encountering many difficulties. It is said that there is a system of regional material supply, where materials from a certain region are only allowed to be purchased by other regions if they cannot be used or are not needed by the region itself. However, it is unclear whether regional supply has considered the current needs of higher education institutions in the Northwest after their substantial increase. If the allocation of materials to the Northwest is still based on the past situation, it is clearly not in line with reality. Therefore, I suggest that if material supply must be regionalized, the increasing development of higher education in the Northwest should also be considered, and an appropriate allocation ratio should be given. The same situation exists for books; only a very small number of important new books published are allocated to cities like Xi'an and Lanzhou, and readers often cannot get their hands on them.

Students returning from the Soviet Union and capitalist countries in recent years have remained in the capital or coastal cities, with very few going to the Northwest. The government should consider the Northwest region when allocating and using them.

(2) The teaching staff in the old institutions in the Northwest is not strong. Since liberation eight years ago, with the exception of Lanzhou University, which received support from several teachers from outside last year, other schools have only seen a substantial increase in young teaching assistants. The number of teachers who can play a leading role in teaching or scientific research has hardly changed. The old teachers who have lived in the Northwest for a long time find it difficult to keep up with the rapid advancements in various sciences over the past twenty years. Therefore, the improvement of teaching and the development of scientific research in the old institutions in the Northwest in recent years have been unsatisfactory. The main reason is the lack of new core strength. Students returning from the Soviet Union and capitalist countries in recent years have remained in the capital or coastal cities; very few have gone to the Northwest. The teaching and research work in higher education institutions in the coastal areas is generally very active. The various experts who have returned from abroad in recent years are the main driving force for carrying out their work. In order to further improve the teaching and scientific research work of higher education institutions in the Northwest so that they can adapt to the increasingly developing construction projects in the Northwest, I hope that the government can consider the Northwest region when allocating and using experts returning from the Soviet Union and capitalist countries.

Relevant units should give special consideration to teachers sent out for advanced studies by schools in the interior; teachers sent out for advanced studies by a certain institution must return to teach at the original institution.

(3) In the absence of external support, higher education institutions in the Northwest have adopted a self-reliant approach in recent years, sending a large number of young teaching assistants to brother schools with domestic and foreign experts and various research institutes of the Academy of Sciences for advanced studies. They have also received support from brother schools and the Academy of Sciences. This approach has had very good results in recent years. Teachers who can basically complete teaching tasks have been obtained for several necessary courses that could not be offered. However, the number of teachers sent out is often limited by quotas and housing. I hope that higher education institutions and scientific research institutions with domestic and foreign experts will give special consideration to teachers sent out for advanced studies by schools in the interior. If there is not enough housing, the Ministry of Higher Education should provide support in terms of infrastructure construction. I believe that advanced study in China is one of the most economical and effective ways to train teachers and must be vigorously promoted. However, there are also situations where the units providing advanced studies sometimes mobilize young teaching assistants sent out by various institutions who have completed their studies and have good grades to stay and work in their own units, without intending to send them back to their original institutions. I believe that this is not a very correct approach, and I hope that the leadership can stop this and stipulate that teachers sent out for advanced studies by a certain institution must return to teach at the original institution.

Several Effective Ways to Remedy the Shortage of Teachers in Various Institutions

(4) In order to remedy the shortage of teachers in various institutions in the Northwest, there are also several other effective ways: (1) Plan to invite experts with specialized knowledge from other regions to give lectures on a certain course for one month to one semester; listeners are not limited to students, but also include teaching assistants and scientific workers in relevant business departments in the region. (2) Graduate students from advanced institutions in other regions, especially those trained by Soviet experts, can play a certain role in the teaching of some specialized courses and should be considered for allocation to the Northwest (but very few of these graduate students are allocated to the Northwest). (3) It is also hoped that various national academic conferences or conferences related to teaching work can be held in the Northwest region; this will have a great effect on promoting the academic atmosphere. For example, the conference on large-pore loess is rumored to be held in Harbin this year, but we believe that it would be more appropriate to hold it in the Northwest.

Resolutely go to the Northwest to prepare more effectively to participate in the construction of the motherland.

(5) The Northwest is one of the key areas for industrial construction in our country. Taking Xi'an as an example, factories of various types are under construction, and some have already been put into production. In order to implement the principle of higher industrial institutions being close to industrial bases, the government has moved several large-scale institutions from other regions to Xi'an since last year (some have moved entirely, and some have moved a certain major of each institution to Xi'an to form a new single-discipline college). This is an extremely exciting event for the people of all circles in Xi'an. However, due to the urgency of time last year, the preparatory work for moving and building the schools was not sufficient. When school started in September, the urgently needed school buildings were not yet completed, and teachers and students generally felt inconvenience. Moreover, because the vast majority of them come from areas outside the Northwest, they are not yet accustomed to the life, resulting in negative emotions among some teachers and students. When CPPCC members and NPC (National People's Congress) representatives inspected Xi'an last year, they received a lot of feedback in this regard. However, these are all difficulties encountered in development, and everything can be overcome and resolved with the efforts and care of the Party and governments at all levels. Comrades engaged in higher education and young people studying in higher education institutions will certainly put the interests of the people first. Since the Northwest is the key area for national industrial construction, they should resolutely go to the Northwest, more effectively exert their expertise, and more effectively prepare to participate in the construction of the motherland. It is also hoped that the members in East China (especially Shanghai) will do more persuasion and mobilization work so that the teachers and students who will come to Xi'an this year will happily embark on new jobs and learning positions.

The problems mentioned above may not be comprehensive, or they may have already been understood and considered by the government. If some of them are correct, I hope they can be forwarded to the relevant departments for research and handling.

    为西北地区文教建设工作呼吁
    岳劼恒希望照顾西北地区的困难
    我这次到首都参加政协会议，在会前听了毛主席关于如何正确处理人民内部矛盾的讲话和李富春副总理关于第二个五年计划建议的若干问题的说明，在会议中听了周总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告、陈叔通副主席政协委员会的工作报告和其他各位领导同志的发言，受到深刻的教育和启发，我表示完全同意和拥护。
    我现在就西北地区文教方面工作，发表一些意见。解放八年以来，由于党和各级政府的正确领导和大力支持，西北各省文教工作方面，有飞跃的进展。但在进展的过程中，也出现了一些困难，如果不急速解决，势必影响到前进的速度。我根据工作中所遇到的问题和所连系群众的呼声，本知无不言，言无不尽的原则，列举如下，请大会指正。
    物资供应必须照顾西北高等教育发展的需要。
    （一）西北各高等院校的仪器设备，几年来虽有大量的扩充，但仍不能适应教学和研究的需要。除国外购置因外汇关系大加核减外，国内购置也存在着一些问题。去年各院校购置国内制造的仪器设备，由于西北缺货，分别派人到武汉、天津、上海等地采购，遇着不少的困难。据说物资有分区供应的制度，某区的物资，除本区用不了或用不着时，才允许外区购置。但分区供应，不知是否考虑到西北现时高等院校大量增加后的需要。如果仍以过去的情况给西北分配物资，则显然不合实际。因此我建议如果物资供应必须分区，也应当考虑西北高等教育日益发展的情况，给以适当的分配比例。对于图书，也有同样的情况；重要的新书出版，仅分配极小量的册数到西安、兰州等城市，读者往往抢不到手。
    几年来由苏联和各资本主义国家回国的学生不留于首都，即留于沿海城市，能到西北者渺无其人。政府在分配和使用他们时，应照顾到西北地区。
    （二）西北旧有各院校的教师阵营不强。解放八年以来，除兰州大学去年得到外来若干位教师支援外，其他各校只是青年讲助有大量的增加，能在教学或科学研究工作中起领导作用的教师，人数上绝少变动。原来久居西北的老教师，在业务方面难以赶得上二十年来各项科学的飞跃前进。因而在西北旧有的院校，几年来无论在教学工作的改进以及科学研究的展开，显然不能令人满意。主要原因是新生骨干力量的缺乏。几年来由苏联和各资本主义国家回国的学生不留于首都，即留于沿海城市；能到西北者渺无其人。沿海地区各高等校院的教学工作和研究工作，一般十分活跃，他们在这几年得到由国外回来的各项专家，是开展工作的主要动力。为了把西北高等学校的教学和科学研究工作提高一步，使能和西北日益开展的建设事业相适应，我希望政府对于由苏联和资本主义国家回国的专家，能在分配使用上照顾到西北地区。
    有关单位对内地学校派出的进修教师，应特别予以照顾；凡某院校派出的进修教师，必须回原校任教。
    （三）在外来支援力量难以得到的情况下，西北各院校几年来采取自力更生的方式，大量派青年讲助到有国内外专家的兄弟学校和科学院各研究所进修学习，也得到各兄弟学校和科学院的支持。几年来这一办法有很好的效果，若干必要而不能开出的课程，都得到基本上能完成教学任务的教师，但在向外派出教师时，也往往受到名额和住房的限制，我希望有国内外专家的高等学校和科学研究机构，应对内地学校派来的进修教师，特别予以照顾，如果房屋不够，高教部应在基建方面予以支持。我认为在国内进修是培养教师最经济最有效的方式之一，必须大力提倡。但也有这种情况：各院校送外进修的青年讲助，在学习完毕并且有良好成绩的，进修单位有时动员其留本单位工作，不拟遣返原院校，我认为这是不很正确的办法，希望领导上能加以阻止，并规定凡某院校派出的进修教师，必须回原校任教。
    补救各院校师资不足的几项行之有效的办法
    （四）为了补救西北各院校师资不足问题，另外有几项行之有效的办法：（1）有计划地延请其他地区学有专长的专家，对某门课程，作一个月到一个学期的讲授；听讲者不限于学生，讲助以及在本地区有关业务部门的科学工作者都可参加。（2）外地先进院校的研究生尤其是由苏联专家培养的研究生，对于一些专门课程的教学，能起一定的作用，在分配使用时应照顾到西北（而这项研究生，能分配到西北绝少）。（3）各项全国性的学术会议，或者有关教学工作的会议，也希望能在西北地区举行一些；这对于提倡学术空气，有很大的作用。例如今年大孔性黄土会议，据闻将在哈尔滨举行，我们以为西北举行更为合适。
    坚决走到西北去，更有效地准备参加祖国的建设工作。
    （五）西北是我国工业建设重点地区之一。以西安市为例，各种类型的工厂，正在兴建中，有些已经投入生产。为了贯彻高等工业院校接近工业基地的原则，政府从去年起把几所规模宏大的院校，由其他地区迁到西安（有些是全部迁来的，有些是把各院校的某一专业，迁到西安共组成一个新的单科学院）。这对西安各界人民来说，是一件极其令人兴奋的大事。但去年因为时间仓猝，迁校建校的准备工作，做的不够，九月开学，急需的校舍，还没有完工，教师和同学普遍感觉不便。又因他们绝大多数都是来自西北以外的地区，在生活上一时还不习惯，因而部分师生中间产生消极情绪。去年政协委员和人大代表在西安视察时，得到这一方面的反映不少。但这都是发展中遇见的困难，在党和各级人民政府努力和关怀之下，一切可以克服解决。从事高等教育工作的同志和在高等学校学习的青年，一定能把人民的利益，摆在第一位。既然西北是国家工业建设的重点，就应当坚决走到西北去，更有效地发挥自己的专长，更有效地准备参加祖国的建设工作。还希望在华东（尤其是上海）的委员们，多做一些说服和动员工作，使今年将来到西安的教师和学生，愉快的走上新的工作岗位和学习岗位。
    以上所提到的问题，可能不够全面，也可能是政府已经了解已经考虑过的。如果有部分正确的话，希望能转交有关部门研究处理。
