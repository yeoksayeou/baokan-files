Xinhua News Agency, March 4th: Amman dispatch: Jordanian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Rimawi said on March 3rd that any attempt to internationalize the Gulf of Aqaba will be resolutely rejected by the Arab neutral countries. He pointed out that asking Arab countries to internationalize the Gulf of Aqaba is like asking the United States to internationalize the Gulf of Mexico.

Rimawi said that Jordan is willing to accept economic assistance without any conditions, but the United States' consideration of military "obligations" in the Middle East is "of no practical importance." He said that the so-called communist threat in the Middle East is "a myth used by Western countries to promote their plans, and we do not agree with this statement."

He also said that in fact, the danger to Arab nationalism comes from Western imperialism and Israel, and "Israel is an accomplice of Western imperialism."

Rimawi said that the work of forming an alliance between Jordan and Egypt "is in progress." This alliance will eventually develop into one including the entire Arab world.

Referring to Israel's refusal to implement the United Nations' resolution on troop withdrawal, Rimawi said that Israel's approach to the troop withdrawal issue is as if they are confident of getting the support of a major power.

Jordanian Army Chief of Staff Nowar told a United Press reporter on the 2nd that the only possible explanation for the US negotiations with Israel is: "The United States wants to please Israel." He said: "We cannot be friends with any country that encourages Israel."

Nowar denied the claim that the quality of the Jordanian army has declined since the dismissal of the former commander of the Arab Legion, the British officer Glubb. He said that Jordan is strengthening its army.

Nowar expressed his willingness to accept military aid from the West or aid from the Soviet Union. He said: "We will accept any assistance from any side, if we are not thereby restricted."

Xinhua News Agency, March 4th: London dispatch: Indian Minister Without Portfolio Menon arrived in London by plane from New York on the 2nd and held talks with British Prime Minister Macmillan and Commonwealth Relations Secretary Home, and held talks with Foreign Secretary Lloyd on the 3rd. It is reported that the Kashmir issue, the Middle East issue, and the Cyprus issue were discussed in these talks.

On the same day, Menon said at a press conference when talking about the Middle East issue: The main problem now "is to clear the Suez Canal and withdraw foreign troops stationed on Egyptian territory." He said that if Israel refuses to withdraw from the Gaza Strip, the United Nations should take other steps to resolve this issue. When asked by a reporter whether he agreed with the United Nations forces being stationed in the Gaza Strip, Menon replied: "We have said in the past that it has never been the task of this force to take over the work of the aggressors."

When talking about the management of the Suez Canal after it is opened, Menon said: "The Egyptians are fully capable of effectively managing (the canal)."

He pointed out that Egypt has the legitimate right to refuse to allow ships that Egypt considers to be a threat to its security to pass through the Suez Canal, because the Suez Canal is a waterway within Egyptian territory.

Menon is scheduled to leave London for Cairo on March 4, where he will hold talks with Egyptian President Nasser.

    约旦外交国务大臣说
    阿拉伯国家不接受亚喀巴湾国际化
    梅农表示联合国应采取其他步骤解决以色列拒绝撤军问题
    新华社4日讯  安曼消息：约旦外交国务大臣里马维3日说，任何想使亚喀巴湾国际化的尝试，都将遭到阿拉伯中立国家断然的拒绝。他指出，要求阿拉伯国家使亚喀巴湾国际化正如同要求美国使墨西哥湾国际化一样。
    里马维说，约旦愿意接受不附带任何条件的经济援助，但是美国所考虑的中东的军事“义务”是“没有任何实际重要意义的”。他说，所谓中东存在共产主义威胁的说法是“西方国家用来推行他们的计划的一种神话，我们不同意这种说法”。
    他还说，事实上对于阿拉伯民族主义的危险是来自西方帝国主义和以色列，“以色列是西方帝国主义的同伙”。
    里马维说，约旦同埃及结成联盟的工作“正在进行中”。这个联盟终于将发展成包括整个阿拉伯世界在内。
    在谈到以色列拒绝执行联合国的撤军决议时，里马维说，以色列在撤军问题上的做法就好像他们有把握会得到一个大国的支持似的。
    约旦陆军参谋长诺瓦尔2日对合众社记者说，对美国同以色列谈判的唯一可能的解释是：“美国要讨好以色列。”他说：“我们不能同任何鼓励以色列的国家做朋友。”
    诺瓦尔否认自从解除前阿拉伯军团司令、英国人格拉布的职务以来，约旦军队质量下降的说法。他说，约旦正在加强它的陆军。
    诺瓦尔表示愿意接受西方的军事援助或是苏联的援助。他说：“我们将接受任何方面的任何援助，如果我们不因此而受到约束的话。”
    据新华社4日讯  伦敦消息：印度不管部长梅农2日从纽约乘飞机到伦敦同英国首相麦克米伦和联邦关系大臣霍姆进行了会谈，并在3日同外交大臣劳埃德举行了会谈。消息说，在这些会谈里讨论了克什米尔问题、中东问题、塞浦路斯问题等。
    同一天梅农在记者招待会上谈到中东问题的时候说：现在的主要问题“是清理苏伊士运河和撤退驻扎在埃及领土上的外国军队”。他表示，如果以色列拒绝从加沙地带撤出，联合国应该采取其他的步骤来解决这个问题。有记者问他是否同意联合国部队驻扎在加沙地区，梅农回答说：“我们过去说过，接替侵略者的工作从来就不是这支部队的任务。”
    梅农在谈到苏伊士运河开放以后的管理问题的时候说：“埃及人完全有能力有效地进行（运河的）管理。”
    他指出，埃及有合法的权利拒绝允许那些埃及认为威胁到它的安全的船只通过苏伊士运河，因为苏伊士运河是在埃及领土内的水道。
    梅农定3月4日离开伦敦去开罗，他将同埃及总统纳赛尔举行会谈。
