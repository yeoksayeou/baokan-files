Our Four Suggestions
    Li Shoumin Guo Gushi Liu Yuankai Xu Xiaonong Joint Speech

    We are all workers from the political consultative conferences of several small cities in Shandong. We are not widely traveled and have very little knowledge. Therefore, we are attending this conference with a humble attitude of learning. This goal has been achieved. After listening to Chairman Mao's important instructions at the Supreme State Conference, we have initially gained a clear understanding of how to recognize and handle problems, and we may make fewer major mistakes in our future work. After listening to Vice Premier Li's explanation on several issues concerning the proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan at the preparatory meeting, we understood the basic spirit of the Second Five-Year Plan. After the opening of the conference, we listened to Premier Zhou's report on his visit to eleven Asian and European countries and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the Standing Committee, which gave us a clearer understanding of the international situation and a general understanding of the scope of the CPPCC's work. We have learned a lot. We express our complete agreement with and heartfelt support for Chairman Mao's instructions and all the reports, and we are determined to implement them in our practical work. In particular, after listening to Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech on increasing production and practicing economy on March 9, we realized that increasing production and practicing economy is an important political task for the whole country.

    Now I would like to make four suggestions to the conference:

Strengthen the leadership of local CPPCC learning work

    1. The learning of people from all walks of life is an important issue at present, because they are scattered in every corner and have different thoughts and opinions on the new society and new politics. If we do not transform their thinking through learning, it will not only fail to help various tasks but also create resistance, which is not suitable for uniting all forces that can be united to serve the construction of socialism. Over the past year, local CPPCC organizations in Shandong have organized many people from all walks of life to conduct studies and have achieved considerable results. However, we feel it is very difficult to obtain learning materials, which makes it extremely difficult to formulate a learning plan. It is suggested that the leadership of local CPPCC learning work should be strengthened, appropriate learning materials should be arranged in a planned way, and timely instructions should be issued so that we can follow them.

Pay attention to avoiding waste in public medical care

    2. Increasing production and practicing economy is an important measure in the process of building socialism, so we thought of the issue of public medical care. Public medical care is a kind of welfare for cadres and workers, and it is also one of the superior systems of socialism. However, because some medical personnel cannot correctly grasp the principles of treatment and prescribe expensive medicines indiscriminately, and some people who enjoy public medical care demand expensive medicines without principle, the overspending on public medical care is very large, which has become a common phenomenon. In the outpatient department of the hospital, cadres and workers constantly make unreasonable demands to doctors, and even pester them endlessly, asking to be allowed to take leave or be hospitalized. When they need to be transferred to another hospital or discharged from the hospital, it is necessary to mobilize and persuade them. Some even do not plan to be discharged after being hospitalized. In many cases, some are due to the improper handling by doctors, and some are due to the demands made by cadres and workers. No matter how many times the explanation is given, they turn a deaf ear. When it is reported to their leaders, the result is sometimes ineffective. This waste should be taken seriously. On the one hand, education should be strengthened for medical personnel to improve their understanding, establish a sense of responsibility, and strictly implement the principles of medical treatment, so that patients should be given medicine when they should be given medicine, hospitalized when they should be hospitalized, and discharged or transferred to another hospital when they should be discharged or transferred to another hospital. At the same time, education should also be strengthened for comrades who enjoy public medical care, so that they can obey doctors and not make unnecessary demands to doctors that do not conform to the principles of treatment based on their own superficial understanding or hearsay. We suggest that it is best to solve this overspending through mutual education and paying attention to national assets.

Deeply publicize the policy towards overseas Chinese to the masses

    3. The government has always cared about and attached importance to overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, but because the publicity of the policy has not been popularized and deepened, the masses do not have enough understanding of them. Taking Weihai, Shandong as an example, there are more than 4,000 overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots who have gone abroad. In recent years, they have heard of the greatness of the motherland and want to go home, but they still have concerns. In addition, the masses have a very poor understanding and think that they are working for the imperialists, so they have a discriminatory attitude towards the families of overseas Chinese and Hong Kong compatriots. Now that we are building socialism, it is still necessary for the government to continue to pay attention to the implementation of the policy towards overseas Chinese.

Pay attention to the study of Chinese education and educational history

    4. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, it has been very correct and necessary to learn everything from the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union has more than 30 years of experience in nation-building. Just in terms of education, due to the systematic study of advanced Soviet experience, we have gone from knowing nothing to knowing, from superficial to profound, and from one-sided to comprehensive. As a result, education has undergone great changes and achieved certain results. Even a rural primary school teacher knows the educational policy of all-round development. In teaching, the application of teaching principles, the selection of teaching methods, and the structure of the entire classroom teaching should specify those links and how to be consistent with theory and practice, etc. What is even more prominent is that the purpose of education is achieved through teaching, cultivating children's new morals and new qualities, and developing their individuality. Teachers across the country are learning, teaching, and improving themselves at the same time, and they are very enthusiastic. Some teachers are also doing popular science work while teaching, which is essentially different from teachers in old China, both in theory and in practice. Of course, it is not to say that we have reached the peak and will no longer move forward. It should be noted that although teachers have achieved some achievements, they are only a good start, and it can be said that they have entered the hall but have not yet entered the room. In the future, we must move forward in bigger steps and learn from the Soviet Union more carefully and profoundly. Moreover, we are moving forward, and the teachers of the Soviet Union will not stop. However, since the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, we believe that Chinese educators should, on the one hand, learn from the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, compile a history of Chinese education, because China has thousands of years of history and has produced many educational scholars. Through letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, we should clarify right and wrong and determine what to take and what to discard. Based on Soviet education, we should appropriately add Chinese specific materials, so that teachers will not simply cite Comenius, Ushinsky, etc. in their work... as if China had nothing to take from the past. As for the history of Chinese education, of course, the content is entirely Chinese materials, and it is more difficult to sort out, but as a Chinese teacher, it is very necessary to have the common sense of Chinese education history, which can be said to be a basic condition. Primary and secondary school teachers account for a large number in our country. If they accept part of the property of their own country on the basis of learning from the Soviet Union, they will be richer and stronger, and they will be more powerful for education. It is suggested that the conference should ask our educational scholars to pay attention to the research of this issue in the future, which we think is necessary.

    Whether what I have said is appropriate or not, please correct and criticize me.

    Finally, I wish everyone good health! (Attached picture)

    我们的四点建议
    李寿民  郭谷石  刘元恺  许效农联合发言
    我们几个人，都是山东几个小城市政协委员会的工作者，见闻不广，学识甚低，所以参加这次大会，都抱着虚心学习的态度。这个目的已经达到，在最高国务会议上听了毛主席的重要指示，对于如何认识问题，处理问题，我们初步的有了明确认识，将来在工作中，可能少犯大的错误。在预备会上听了李副总理关于第二个五年计划建议的若干问题的说明，我们了解了第二个五年计划的基本精神。大会开幕后，又听了周总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告及陈叔通副主席作的常务委员会的工作报告，对国际形势更加清楚，对政协工作略知范围。我们学的东西不少，对毛主席的指示及所有的报告，我们表示完全同意，衷心拥护，并且坚决贯彻到实际工作中去。尤其是3月9日听了陈云副总理关于增产节约的发言，我们认识了增产节约是全国的重要政治任务。
    现在向大会谈四点建议：加强对地方政协学习工作的领导
    一、社会人士的学习在当前来说是一个重要问题，因为他们散居在各个角落，对于新的社会新的政治有不同的思想和看法，如果不通过学习改造他们的思想，对各项工作不但不能起到助力，反而发生阻力，对团结一切可能团结的力量为建设社会主义服务是不相适合的。一年来，山东地方政协组织了不少的各界人士进行了学习，取得相当的成绩。但是学习材料，甚感困难，因而对学习计划的规定，极难着手。建议对地方政协学习工作加强领导，有计划的布置适当的学习材料，及时的指示下达，我们好遵照执行。注意避免公费医疗中的浪费现象
    二、增产节约在建设社会主义的过程中是一个重要措施，因而想到公费医疗问题，公费医疗是干部职工的一种福利，也是社会主义优越制度之一。但是由于医务人员有的不能正确地掌握治疗原则，滥发贵药，而享受公费医疗的人有的又是无原则的要求服用贵药，造成公费医疗的超支数字很大，已成普遍现象。在医院的门诊部不断有干部职工向医生提出无理要求，甚至纠缠不休，要求准他休假或者住院。需要转院需要出院，必经动员说服，甚至住院以后，就不打算出院。种种情况，固然有的是医生处理欠当，也有干部职工提出要求，再三解说置若罔闻，反映到他们的领导，结果也有的无效。这笔浪费，应当重视，一面对医务人员加强教育，使他们提高认识，树立责任感，严格执行医疗原则，作到对病员该服药就服药，该住院就住院，该出院转院就出院转院。同时对享受公费医疗的同志们，也应加强教育，使他们服从医生，不能任凭自己的一知半解或道听途说而无谓的向医生提出不合治疗原则的要求。我们建议最好通过双方教育，重视国家资财，这个超支是可以解决的。向群众深入宣传对待侨胞的政策
    三、关于国外华侨及港澳同胞，政府一向是关心他们的，重视他们的，但由于政策的宣传没能普及深入，群众对他们还没有足够的认识。就山东威海说，出国华侨和港澳同胞就有四千多人，几年来他们听到祖国的伟大，心想回家还有顾虑，再加群众认识极差，以为他们依附帝国主义工作，因而对侨眷及港胞家属抱有歧视的心情。现在正在建设社会主义的时候，建议政府继续注意对侨胞政策的贯彻，还是必要的。注意研究中国教育学和教育史
    四、建国以来，一切学习苏联，这是十分正确的，也是必要的，因为苏联有三十多年的建国经验。仅就教育工作说，由于系统的学习了苏联先进经验，我们从不知而知，从肤浅而深刻，从片面而整体，于是教育工作大改面貌，取得一定的成绩。即便一个农村初小教师他也知道全面发展的教育方针，在教学上，教学原则的运用，教学方法的选择，以及整个课堂教学的结构，应该规定那些环节，如何理论与实践一致等等。更突出的是通过教学实现教育目的，培养孩子们新的道德新的品质，发展他们的个性。全国教师边学边教边提高，劲头是不小。还有部分教师一面教学，一面作科学普及工作，较之旧中国的教师，无论在理论上、在实践上，已经是本质上的不同。当然不是说登峰造极不再前进，须知现在教师们虽然有些成就，仅是好的开端，也可以说升堂尚未入室，以后更要大踏步的前进，更细致的、更深刻的学习苏联，且说我们前进，苏联的教师们也不停止。但是自从党中央提出百花齐放、百家争鸣，我们认为中国的教育工作者，一方面学习苏联，一方面也应编一部中国教育学、中国教育史，因为中国有几千年的历史，曾出现不少的教育学者。通过百花齐放，百家争鸣，明确是非，以定取舍。以苏联教育学为基础，适当的参加上中国的具体材料，这样教师们在工作中就不至单纯的引证夸美纽斯·乌申斯基……好像中国过去一无可取。至于中国教育史，当然内容完全是中国材料，整理比较困难一些，但作为一个中国教师来说，很应该有中国教育史的常识，也可说这是起码条件，中小学教师在我国占的数字不少，如果他们在学习苏联的基础上，再接受本国的一部分财产，他们就更丰富，更壮大，对于教育工作更有力。建议大会转请我国教育学者今后注意这个问题的研究，我们认为是需要的。
    以上所谈，是否有当，尚祈指正批评。
    最后祝全体健康！（附图片）
