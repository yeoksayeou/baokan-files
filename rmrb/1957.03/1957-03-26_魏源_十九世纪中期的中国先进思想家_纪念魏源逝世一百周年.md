On the eve of the Opium War, due to the deepening internal crisis of feudal society and the intrusion of Western capitalist forces, China had declined from an economically and culturally advanced country in the world to a socially and economically backward and weak country. At that time, a group of relatively enlightened bureaucratic landlord class intellectuals gradually separated from the feudal ruling class. They began to feel the crisis of feudal society, and therefore paid attention to understanding the situation of Western capitalist countries, and demanded domestic military and political reforms to effectively resist aggression and defend the motherland. Wei Yuan was a representative of these enlightened figures in the bureaucratic landlord class.

Wei Yuan (1794-1857), courtesy name Moshen, was a native of Baoqing, Hunan. Today is the centenary of his death [Note]. He was a famous scholar and advanced thinker in the mid-nineteenth century. He was knowledgeable in many fields, and had very important works in classics, philosophy, history, and geography. What is particularly important is that he put forward his own views and solutions to some important socio-economic issues of the time.

Regarding these practical issues, he wrote "Essays on River Management," "Essays on Canal Transport," "Essays on Salt Administration" (see "Collected Works of Guweitang") and "Essays on Maritime Defense" (see "Illustrated Treatise on Maritime Kingdoms").

The Yellow River has always been a major disaster in China. Wei Yuan's "Essays on River Management" proposed that to eliminate the disaster of the Yellow River, it is necessary to fundamentally solve the problem of the Yellow River. He suggested diverting the Yellow River into the sea from the Daqing River in Shandong. He said: This is the "eastern route" of the Yellow River, a "natural and deep ravine," "naturally created, there is nothing better than this" ("Outer Collection of Guweitang," Volume 5). What is the practical value of his suggestion is, of course, still a question, and it cannot be compared with our current great plan to build the Sanmenxia Dam to fundamentally control the Yellow River. However, his attention to the fundamental control of the Yellow River was of progressive significance at the time. If he could see our current "Yellow River Management" millennial plan, he would be very happy.

"Essays on Canal Transport" and "Essays on Salt Administration" proposed solutions that he believed would fundamentally solve the problems of the so-called canal transport administration and salt administration at the time. The presentation of these issues and the solutions he proposed were also progressive at the time. Particularly progressive was his "Essays on Maritime Defense." The plan proposed in "Essays on Maritime Defense" was a countermeasure proposed by progressive thinkers at the time after China's defeat in the Opium War to resist the aggression of Western capitalist countries, and was a serious beginning to "learn from the West."

During the Opium War, Wei Yuan advocated resolute resistance. He participated in Yu Qian's staff and fought against the British invading forces in Zhejiang. After the war failed, he was extremely grieved. He said: This situation is "what anyone with blood and spirit should be indignant about, and what anyone with ears, eyes, mind, and knowledge should discuss and plan" (Preface to "Illustrated Treatise on Maritime Kingdoms"). At that time, he was one of the people who actively proposed "discussion and planning." The central idea of his "discussion and planning" was "learn the superior techniques of the barbarians to control the barbarians" (Preface to "Illustrated Treatise on Maritime Kingdoms"). Moreover, he believed that the first thing to do at that time was to "thoroughly understand the situation of the barbarians" ("Holy Wars," Volume 12).

When Lin Zexu was banning opium and resisting British aggression in Guangdong, he also advocated that it was necessary to first "thoroughly understand the situation of the barbarians." He collected a lot of historical and geographical materials about the West. Wei Yuan, based on the materials collected by Lin Zexu and his own collection, compiled the "Illustrated Treatise on Maritime Kingdoms" in fifty volumes, later expanded to sixty volumes, and finally expanded to one hundred volumes. His "Essays on Maritime Defense" is included in this book. This book was a systematic work on Western history and geography at the time. Its influence reached Japan. The book describes British affairs in particular detail. His conclusion on Britain was: "Within the four seas, their sails and masts reach everywhere. Wherever there is land and people, they all survey and assess, thinking of extracting their essence" ("Illustrated Treatise on Maritime Kingdoms," Volume 52). He had a fairly deep understanding of the facts of capitalist countries expanding colonies and exploiting colonial people.

His specific method of "learning from the barbarians" was: China should first set up factories to manufacture steamships and guns, and then, on this basis, develop China's own industry. After the shipyards have manufactured enough warships, they can manufacture merchant ships; after the arms factories have manufactured enough guns, they can manufacture various machines. "Anything that benefits the people can be manufactured here" ("Illustrated Treatise on Maritime Kingdoms," Volume 2). He believed that by transforming military industry into civilian industry, China could embark on the road of industrialization.

At that time, those ignorant and arrogant reactionary landlord class elements vigorously opposed the manufacture of machines. Their class instinct realized that the use of machines would harm their class interests. They slandered machines as "strange skills and extravagant crafts," as "trifles." Wei Yuan put forward a powerful criticism of this reactionary ideology. He said: "The ancient sages hollowed out boats and sharpened oars to cross the impassable. They strung bows and sharpened arrows to awe the world. Are these not trifles?" "Useful things are strange skills but not extravagant crafts. Now, Western machinery borrows wind power, water power, and fire power, seizes creation, and communicates with the gods. It is nothing but exhausting the power of ears, eyes, mind, and thought to serve the people. Use their strengths and make them based on their strengths. The atmosphere is opening up day by day, and wisdom is emerging day by day. Only then can we see that the people of the East Sea are like the people of the West Sea." ("Illustrated Treatise on Maritime Kingdoms," Volume 2) In this passage, he pointed out the way out for China at that time; in the process of industrial development, he saw China's future. This way out and future were actually capitalist industrialization.

These ideas of Wei Yuan show that he had a certain understanding of the progressive role of science and technology, and also had some superficial understanding of the superiority of the capitalist system over the feudal system. He said: "In North America (referring to the United States), tribes replace monarchs, and its regulations can be passed down for generations without harm" (Postscript to "Illustrated Treatise on Maritime Kingdoms"). The so-called "regulations" refer to the American Constitution.

Not only that, Wei Yuan also realized the corruption and paralysis of the bureaucracy at that time, as well as the muddle-headedness and ignorance of the ruling group, and therefore proposed eliminating old habits to resist foreign insults. He said: "A minister of the Ming Dynasty said that to quell the Japanese pirates on the sea, we must first quell the Japanese pirates in people's hearts." He believed that there were two problems in people's hearts at that time: one was "sleep," which was muddle-headedness and ignorance; the other was "emptiness," which was emptiness and unreality. Eliminating "sleep" and "emptiness" is the so-called "removing the two evils." The driving force for "removing the two evils" is "indignation and worry," that is: indignation at China's failures at that time and worry about China's future prospects. He also said: "If the country wants to promote the benefits and eliminate the harms of the past few hundred years, it must start with comprehensively verifying names and realities. If it wants to comprehensively verify names and realities, the scholar-officials must abandon calligraphy and stereotyped writing, and seek regulations and study national history, abandon clerks' precedents and plans, and seek grand strategies and long-term plans" ("Holy Wars," Volume 11). That is to say: to "remove the two evils," we must "seek truth from facts," abolish calligraphy and the eight-legged essay, and study practical subjects such as law (regulations) and history (national history).

Wei Yuan's thought in this aspect has capitalist elements. This kind of thought of his played a certain role in promoting the emergence of China's capitalist economy after the 1860s. Later, during the Hundred Days' Reform, reformers such as Kang Youwei advocated developing industry, opening parliament, abolishing the imperial examination, and establishing schools. These ideas were also a development of Wei Yuan's thought in this aspect.

Wei Yuan's thought inherited the excellent traditions of Chinese feudal culture, which is inseparable from his relatively correct understanding of the West.

In academic terms, he was a pioneer of the New Text Classics movement at that time. In the early Qing Dynasty, the intellectuals' thoughts of resisting the rule of foreign tribes were very strong. The two autocratic rulers, Yongzheng and Qianlong, cruelly launched several "literary inquisitions" and suppressed the intellectuals' ideological resistance. Under the threat of suppression and the lure of wealth, some intellectuals catered to the rulers, and some were forced to adopt escapism. For classics, they only did some textual research and exegesis, detached from politics and detached from reality. By the Jiaqing and Daoguang era, with the invasion of Western capitalist countries from the outside and multiple peasant uprisings from the inside, the Qing rulers' fierce flames were knocked down, and many new problems emerged in society. Under the new historical conditions, intellectuals moved towards the road of linking with politics. In the history of classics, it was manifested as the rise of the New Text Classics movement. Wei Yuan, under the slogan of "governing the world for practical use" in the New Text Classics, on the one hand, opposed the official imperial examination's "calligraphy and stereotyped writing" and the bureaucrats' "clerks' precedents and plans," as mentioned above, and on the other hand, opposed the trivial textual research of private scholars at that time. He believed that this was also "confining the intelligence and wisdom of the world, making them all come from a useless path" ("Outer Collection of Guweitang," Volume 4). The New Text Classics advocated "governing the world for practical use," saying that they wanted to solve practical political and social problems with classics, but in fact, under the banner of classics, they put forward the demands of the landlord class opposition. This was a legal weapon for the landlord class opposition intellectuals to carry out ideological struggle.

In 1826, Wei Yuan selected essays related to political, social, and ideological issues since the Qing Dynasty for He Changling, that is, articles with so-called "governing the world for practical use" value, and compiled them into "Collected Essays on Governing the World in the Imperial Dynasty," published under He Changling's name. The preface to this book puts forward four principles: one is "things must be based on the heart," but "those who are good at speaking about the heart must have verification in things." That is to say, one cannot rely solely on subjectivity and be separated from objectivity. Second: "laws must be based on people," but "those who are good at speaking about people must have resources in laws." That is to say, one cannot rely solely on cleverness and be separated from tools and laws. Third: "the present must be based on the past," but "those who are good at speaking about the past must have verification in the present." That is to say, one cannot talk about ancient times and be separated from modern times. Fourth: "things must be based on me," but "those who are good at speaking about me must ride on things." That is to say, one cannot rely solely on one's own opinions and be separated from the opinions of others (this article is also under the name of He Changling, but it has been included in "Outer Collection of Guweitang," Volume 3). These four principles can be said to be Wei Yuan's method of thinking. The four principles he put forward have two aspects. One aspect shows his idealistic views, and the other aspect shows the scientific elements in his thinking when solving practical problems. It was precisely these factors that played a progressive role at that time. His method has a certain scientific significance.

It was not accidental that Wei Yuan was able to have such a method of thinking. In terms of philosophical thought, he also inherited the excellent traditions of Chinese philosophy. The elements of dialectics in Chinese philosophy are also expressed in his "Mo Gu."

Wei Yuan has a work called "Mo Gu," and his "Collected Works of Guweitang" lists it as "Inner Collection." It can be seen that he attached great importance to this work. "Mo Gu" talks about the opposition of things, saying: "Things in the world are not single, they must have opposites... Among the opposites, there must be one primary and one auxiliary, then the opposition will not lose its uniqueness." According to the examples he cited, Qian and Kun are relative, but Qian is the primary and Kun is the auxiliary. The relationship between ruler and subject, father and son, husband and wife is relative, but "the ruler orders the subject to work together, the father orders the son to follow, and the husband sings and the wife follows." The four barbarians and China are relative, and the petty people and gentlemen are relative, but "the four barbarians cannot be unified without China, and the petty people cannot be protected without gentlemen. The opposite is suitable for mutual success." He realized that in the contradiction and opposition, there must be one opposite side that is primary and one that is secondary, so the opposition of the contradiction is still unity ("Inner Collection of Guweitang," Volume 2). Regarding this point, there were very few Chinese philosophers with dialectical thinking who had put it forward so clearly before. However, the examples he cited were reactionary institutions of feudal society, which shows that Wei Yuan's thought was basically feudalism.

He also talked about the mutual transformation of opposite things. He cited examples saying: "Extreme heat does not produce heat but produces cold, and extreme cold does not produce cold but produces heat."
"Unsatisfactory things are where satisfactory things are hidden. Pleasant things are where the intention of unpleasnt things is taken." He pointed out that there is fortune in misfortune and harm in benefit.
"Elimination and growth gather at the door, and fortune and misfortune share the same root." He said that this is "physical science" ("Inner Collection of Guweitang," Volume 2).

His cyclical concept of "cold comes and heat goes" also shows that he did not exceed the limitations of feudal philosophy; but he recognized that things are changing, which is a progressive element in his thinking.

In terms of epistemology, Wei Yuan also had a materialistic tendency. He believed that "knowledge" must come from "action." "Mo Gu" said: "Only after reaching it can you know it, and only after experiencing it can you know its difficulty. How can there be someone who knows without acting?" He paid attention to the experience of practical life. He cited examples saying that often reading many books does not bring much benefit, but from a word of a teacher or friend, or from a vivid example, one can get great inspiration. Therefore, "people today benefit from the ancients," and "personal teaching is closer than verbal teaching." He paid attention to the observation of practical things. He said: "Looking at the map of the Five Mountains to know the mountains is not as good as one foot of a woodcutter. Talking about the breadth of the Cangming Sea to know the sea is not as good as a glance of a merchant." ("Inner Collection of Guweitang," Volume 2) His views are very different from the ideas of most landlord class intellectuals who rely solely on books for knowledge.

He paid attention to "change" and could also observe things from a practical point of view, so Wei Yuan had very different views on history and politics from the traditional ideas of feudal society. He recognized that history is evolutionary. He pointed out that there are many stars that existed in ancient times but do not exist now, and there are also some stars that did not exist in ancient times but exist now, so the heavens of ancient and modern times are different. Geographically, rivers change, "high banks become valleys, and deep valleys become hills." The lands of ancient and modern times are different. The Three Chu did not have "long beards," and Gou Wu did not have "tattoos." The people of ancient and modern times are different. There are many animals and plants that existed in ancient times but do not exist now, and there are also many animals and plants that did not exist in ancient times but exist now, so the things of ancient and modern times are also different. He concluded: "Therefore, the breath changes every moment, and the only thing that does not change is the Dao. The trend changes every day and cannot be restored... Holding on to the past to rope in the present is called slandering the present. Holding on to the present to judge the past is called slandering the past. Slandering the present cannot be used for governance, and slandering the past cannot be used for learning." ("Inner Collection of Guweitang," Volume 3) He also said: "If the affairs of the world are inconvenient to the people's feelings, change can be restored; if the affairs of the world are convenient to the people's feelings, change cannot be restored." (Ibid., Volume 3) He believed that historical change is progressive. In his words, that is: the more society changes, the more convenient it is for the people. "The more thoroughly the past is changed, the more convenient it is for the people." (Ibid., Volume 2) Compared with the traditional historical view of feudal society, this is a revolutionary statement. He also recognized that "slandering the past cannot be used for learning," which is also a historicalist view.

"Mo Gu" also recognized the power and wisdom of the masses. The book says: "Is the world like a single body? The sovereign is the head; the ministers are the limbs; the outspoken ministers are the throat and tongue; then who is its breath? Is it not the common people? The survival of the nine orifices, hundreds of bones, and four limbs depends on the breath." ("Inner Collection of Guweitang," Volume 3) "Therefore, the Son of Heaven regards himself as one of the people, and thus regards the world as the world of the world." (Ibid., Volume 3) "The views obtained alone must not be as good as the participation and agreement of public opinion." "Combining the wisdom of forty-nine people is wiser than Yao and Yu" (Ibid., Volume 3).

Wei Yuan's more progressive philosophical thoughts, although not his own creation, but he inherited these thoughts and was in an era of great transformation in Chinese history, so he had a relatively correct understanding, and could also put forward relatively correct countermeasures to solve problems. It can also be said that the excellent traditions of Chinese philosophy, embodied in him, played a great progressive role in the great historical transformation.

However, this is only one aspect of Wei Yuan's philosophical thought. As pointed out above, he still believed that there is an "unchanging Dao." He opposed "Dao" to "trend." He believed that "change" only applies to "trend." That is, he recognized that change is the phenomenon, and unchanging is the essence. In his "Original Meaning of Laozi," this kind of thought of his is more clearly expressed. He said: "The Dao has nothing but nothingness. The true and constant refers to the reality of its nothingness, and the profound and mysterious praises its constant nothingness. Laozi saw that learning and art were becoming more and more divergent, stagnating and adhering to traces, and thought of saving it with the true and constant Dao." (Note on Chapter 1 of Laozi) He said: "All existence originates from emptiness, and movement originates from stillness. Therefore, although all things move together, they eventually return to emptiness and stillness." (Note on Chapter 15 of Laozi) When talking about historical and practical political and social issues, he paid attention to "reality," paid attention to "change," and paid attention to "movement." But when it came to fundamental philosophical issues, he focused on the so-called "nothingness," the so-called "true and constant," and the so-called "emptiness and stillness." This is the idealistic essence of his thought. Therefore, his so-called "reality," so-called "change," and so-called "movement" are superficial and incomplete.

This is not surprising, because in the mid-nineteenth century, the total collapse of Chinese feudal society was only beginning to be reflected in thought, and even enlightened intellectuals like Wei Yuan could only have incomplete ideas about "change" and "movement." In the political aspect, although he praised the federal political system without monarchs in the Americas, believing that it could be "passed down for generations without harm," he still wanted to maintain the feudal ruling order of the Qing Dynasty, believing that on this basis, he could build a new industrial system; relying on the Qing Dynasty feudal regime, he could resist foreign aggression. This was completely an illusion.

Facts have proved that the feudal ruling class can only make China increasingly fall into a semi-feudal and semi-colonial status. Only under the leadership of the Chinese working class and the Communist Party can China complete the anti-feudal and anti-imperialist people's revolution and embark on the road of socialist industrialization.

Wei Yuan has been dead for a hundred years. After a hundred years of struggle, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have finally stood up. An independent, self-reliant, glorious, and prosperous new China has been established. What advanced people like Wei Yuan have dreamed of for a hundred years has now been realized.

[Note] One theory says that Wei Yuan died in 1856. This is based on Wei Yuan's son, Wei Qi's "Brief Biography of Lord Wei of Shaoyang." According to the "Brief Biography," Wei Yuan was born on the 24th day of the 3rd month of the 59th year of Qianlong, i.e., April 23, 1794; and died on the 1st day of the 3rd month of the 7th year of Xianfeng, i.e., March 26, 1857.

    魏源——十九世纪中期的中国先进思想家
　　——纪念魏源逝世一百周年
　　冯友兰
      鸦片战争前夜，由于封建社会内部危机的加深，以及西方资本主义势力的侵入，中国已由世界上经济和文化先进的国家，降落到社会经济落后和衰弱的国家。当时，从封建统治阶级中间逐渐分化出一部分比较开明的官僚地主阶级知识分子，他们开始感到封建社会的危机，因而注意了解西方资本主义国家的情况，并且要求进行国内军政改革，以有效地反抗侵略，保卫祖国。魏源就是这些官僚地主阶级中的开明人物的一个代表。
    魏源（1794—1857），字默深，湖南宝庆人。今天，是他逝世一百周年的纪念日〔注〕。他是十九世纪中叶一个著名的学者和先进的思想家。他的学问方面很广，在经学、子学、历史、地理各方面，都有很重要的著作。特别重要的是他对于当时的一些社会经济方面的重要问题，都提出自己的见解和解决方案。
    关于这些实际问题，他著有筹河篇、筹漕篇、筹鹾篇（见“古微堂集”）和筹海篇（见“海国图志”）。
    黄河向来是中国一个很大的祸患。魏源的筹河篇，提出要免除黄河的祸患，必需从根本上解决黄河问题。他建议引导黄河从山东的大清河入海。他说：这是黄河的“东道”，“天然大壑深通”，“天造地设，更无善于此者”（“古微堂外集”卷五）。他的这个建议，在实际上价值若何，当然还是问题，跟我们现在修建三门峡根治黄河的伟大计划，更是不能比拟。但是他注意到黄河必须根治的问题，在当时说，是有进步意义的。他若能看见我们现在“治黄”的千年大计，他一定非常的喜悦。
    筹漕篇和筹鹾篇对于当时所谓漕政、盐政提出他认为是根本解决问题的方案。这些问题的提出和他所拟议的解决方案，在当时也都是有进步意义的。特别有进步意义的，是他的筹海篇。筹海篇所提的方案是中国在鸦片战争中失败后当时的进步思想家所拟议的反抗西方资本主义国家侵略的对策，是“向西方学习”的一个认真的开端。
    在鸦片战争时期，魏源是主张坚决抗战的。他参加了裕谦的幕府，在浙江跟英国的侵略军队打仗。战争失败后，他极为悲愤。他说：这种情形是“凡有血气者所宜愤悱，凡有耳目心知者所宜讲划”（“海国图志”序）。当时，他就是积极提出“讲划”的一个人。他的“讲划”的中心思想就是“师夷长技以制夷”（“海国图志”序）。并且，认为当时要作的事首先就是“洞悉夷情”（“圣武记”卷十二）。
    林则徐在广东禁烟和抵御英国侵略的时候，也是主张必须首先“洞悉夷情”的，他收集了不少关于西方的历史地理的材料。魏源根据林则徐所收集的材料，加上他自己收集的，编成“海国图志”五十卷，后扩充为六十卷，最后扩充为一百卷。他的筹海篇就包括在这部著作里。这部书在当时是一部系统的讲西方历史地理的著作。它的影响，一直及到日本。书中记叙英国的事情特别详细。他对于英国所下的结论是：“四海之内，其帆樯无所不到。凡有土有人之处，无不睥睨相度，思得朘削其精华”（“海国图志”卷五十二）。他对于资本主义国家扩张殖民地、剥削殖民地人民的事实，有相当深刻的认识。
    他所主张的“师夷”的具体办法是：中国自己首先设厂制造轮船和枪炮，然后在这个基础上，发展中国自己的工业。造船厂在制造了足够用的兵船之后，就可制造商船；枪炮厂在制造了足够用的枪炮之外，就可以制造各种机器。“凡有益民用者，皆可于此造之”（“海国图志”卷二）。他认为这样把军需工业转变为民用工业，中国就可以走上工业化的大路。
    当时那些愚昧无知、嚣然自大的反动地主阶级分子，肆力反对制造机器。他们的阶级本能意识到，机器的使用将会害及他们的阶级利益。他们诬蔑机器为“奇技淫巧”，为“形器之末”。魏源对于这种反动思想，提出有力的批判。他说：“古之圣人刳舟剡楫，以济不通。弦弧剡矢，以威天下，亦岂非形器之末？”“有用之物，即奇技而非淫巧。今西洋器械，借风力、水力、火力，夺造化，通神明，无非竭耳目心思之力，以前民用。因其所长而用之，即因其所长而制之。风气日开，智慧日出。方见东海之民犹西海之民。”（“海国图志”卷二）在这一段话里，他指出了中国在当时的出路；在工业发展的过程中，他看出中国的前途。这个出路和前途，其实就是资本主义工业化。
    魏源的这些思想，表示他对科学技术的进步作用，有一定的认识；对资本主义制度优于封建制度，也有一些粗浅认识。他说：“墨利加北洲（指美国）之以部落代君长，其章程可垂奕世而无弊”（“海国图志”后序）。所谓“章程”就是指美国的宪法。
    不仅如此，魏源也认识到当时官僚机构的腐朽瘫痪，以及统治集团的昏愦愚昧，因而提出革除旧习、以御外侮的主张。他说：“明臣有言，欲平海上之倭患，须先平人心中之倭患。”他认为当时人心之患有二：一是“寐”，就是昏庸无知；二是“虚”，就是空虚不实。革除“寐”“虚”，就是所谓“祛二患”。“祛二患”的推动力是“愤与忧”，就是：对于中国当时失败的愤慨，以及对于中国将来前途的忧虑。他又说：“国家欲兴数百年之利弊，在综核名实始。欲综核名实，在士大夫舍楷书帖括而讨章程，讨国故始，舍胥史例案而图訏谟，图远猷始”（“圣武记”卷十一）。这就是说：要“祛二患”，就要“实事求是”，废除书法八股，学习法律（章程）、历史（国故）等等有实用的学问。
    魏源的思想，在这一方面是具有资本主义因素的。他的这种思想，对于十九世纪六十年代以后中国资本主义经济的产生，起了一定的推动作用。后来戊戌变法的时候，康有为等改良主义者，主张兴工业、开议院、废科举、兴学校，这些主张也是魏源这一方面思想的发展。
    魏源思想继承中国封建文化中的优良传统，这同他能对于西洋有比较正确的认识是分不开的。
    在学术方面，他是当时今文经学运动的一个先驱者。清朝初年，知识分子的反抗异族统治的思想，是很强烈的。雍正乾隆两个专制的统治者，凶残地兴了几次“文字狱”，镇压了知识分子在思想上的反抗。在镇压的威胁和利禄的引诱之下，知识分子有的逢迎，有的被迫采取了逃避主义。对于经学，只作些训诂考据底工作，脱离政治、脱离实际。到嘉庆道光时代，外有西方资本主义国家的侵略，内有多次农民起义，清朝统治者的凶焰被打下去了，社会上的许多新问题出来了。知识分子在新的历史条件下，走向同政治联系的道路上。在经学史上表现为今文经学运动的兴起。魏源在今文经学的“经世致用”的口号下，一方面反对当时官方科举的“楷书帖括”和官僚的“胥史例案”，如上面所说，一方面又反对当时私人学者的琐碎考据，他认为这也是“锢天下聪明知慧，使尽出于无用之一途”（“古微堂外集”卷四）。今文经学主张“经世致用”，说是要以经学解决实际的政治社会问题，其实就是在经学底旗帜下，提出地主阶级反对派的要求。这是地主阶级反对派知识分子进行思想斗争的一个合法武器。
    1826年，魏源替贺长龄选清朝以来有关政治、社会和思想各方面问题的论文，即有所谓“经世致用”价值的文章，辑为“皇朝经世文编”，用贺长龄的名义发表。这部书的序文提出四项原则：一是“事必本夫心”，但是“善言心者必有验于事”。这就是说，不能离客观而专靠主观。二是：“法必本于人”，但是“善言人者必有资于法”。这就是说，不能离工具法度而专恃聪明。三是：“今必本夫古”，但是“善言古者必有验于今”。这就是说，不能离开现代而谈古代。四是：“物必本夫我”，但是“善言我者必有乘于物”。这就是说，不能离别人的意见而专凭自己的意见（这篇文章也是用贺长龄名义，但已收入“古微堂外集”卷三）。这四项原则，可以说是魏源的思想方法。他所提出的这四项原则，都有两方面。一方面表现他的唯心主义观点，一方面表现在解决实际问题时他的思想中的科学的因素。正是这些因素，在当时发生了进步的作用。他的方法是有一定科学意义的。
    魏源之所以能有这样思想方法，也不是偶然的。他在哲学思想方面，也继承了中国哲学的优良传统。中国哲学中的辩证法的因素，在他所著的“默觚”中也有表现。
    魏源有一个著作，名为“默觚”，他的“古微堂集”把它列为“内集”。可见他是很重视这个著作的。“默觚”讲到事物底对立，说：“天下物无独必有对。……有对之中，必一主一辅，则对而不失为独。”照他所举的例子说，乾坤是相对的，但是乾为主而坤为辅。君同臣，父同子，夫同妇是相对的，但是“君令臣必共，父命子必宗，夫唱妇必从。”四夷同中国是相对的，小人同君子是相对的，但是“四夷非中国莫统，小人非君子莫为帡幪。相反适以相成也。”他认识到，在矛盾对立中，必有一个对立面是主要的，一个是次要的，所以矛盾的对立，仍是统一（“古微堂内集”卷二）。关于这一点中国以前有辩证法思想的哲学家，像这样的明确的提出，还是很少的。不过他所举的例证却是封建社会的反动制度，这表示魏源的思想基本上还是封建主义的。
    他也谈到相反的东西，互相转变。他举例说：“暑极不生暑而生寒，寒极不生寒而生暑。”
  “不如意之事，如意之所伏也。快意之事，午意之所乘也。”他指出，有祸中之福，有利中之害。
  “消与长聚门，福与祸同根。”他说，这是“物理”（“古微堂内集”卷二）。
    他的“寒来暑往”的循环观念，也表明他没有超过封建哲学的局限性；但是他于此认识到事物是变动的，这是他的思想中的进步成分。
    在认识论方面，魏源还有唯物论的倾向。他认为“知”必从“行”中得来。“默觚”说：“及之而后知，履之而后艰，乌有不行而知者乎？”他注重对于实际生活的体验。他举例子说，往往看许多书，得不到什么益处，而从师友的一句话，或从一个活的事例，可以得到很大的启发。所以“今人益于古人”，“身教亲于言教”。他注重对于实际事物的视察。他说：“披五岳之图以为知山，不如樵夫之一足。谈沧溟之广，以为知海，不如估客之一瞥。”（“古微堂内集”卷二）他的这种见解，同多数地主阶级知识分子之专靠书本求知识的思想，大有不同。
    他注重“变”，又能比较从实际观察事物，因此魏源对于历史政治，都有同封建社会传统思想大不相同的看法。他认识到历史是进化的。他指出：有许多星是古有而今无，也有些星是古无而今有，所以古今的天是不同的。地理上河流变迁，“高岸为谷，深谷为陵。”古今的地是不同的。三楚没有“长鬣”，勾吴也没有“文身”。古今的人是不同的。有许多动植物，古有而今无，也还有许多动植物，古无而今有，是古今的物也是不同的。他得出结论说：“故气化无一息不变者也，其不变者道而已，势则日变而不可复者也。……执古以绳今，是谓诬今。执今以律古，是谓诬古。诬今不可以为治，诬古不可以语学。”（“古微堂内集”卷三）又说：“天下事，人情所不便者，变可复；人情所群便者，变则不可复。”（同上卷三）他认为历史变动，是进步的。用他的话说，就是：社会越变动，就越于人民方便。“变古愈尽，便民愈甚。”（同上卷二）比之于封建社会传统的历史观，这是一个有革命性的说法。他也认识到“诬古不可以语学”，这也是有历史主义的看法。
      “默觚”也认识到群众的力量和智慧。书中说：“天下其一身欤？后，元首；相，股肱；诤臣，喉舌；然则孰为其鼻息，夫非庶人欤？九窍百骸四支之存亡，视乎鼻息。”（古微堂内集，卷三）“故天子自视为众人中之一人，斯视天下为天下之天下。”（同上卷三）“独得之见，必不如众议之参同也。”“合四十九人之智，智于尧禹”（同上卷三）。
    魏源的这些比较进步的哲学思想，虽不是他的特创，但是他继承了这些思想，处在中国历史上大转变的时代，就有他的比较正确的认识，也就能提出比较正确的解决问题的对策。也可以说，中国哲学的优良传统，以他的体现，在历史大转变中，起了很大的进步的作用。
    不过，这只是魏源的哲学思想的一方面。上边已指出，他还是认为有“不变之道”。把“道”同“势”对立起来。认为“变”只适用于“势”。这就是，认变的是现象，不变的是本质。在他所著的“老子本义”中，他的这种思想，有更清楚的表现。他说：“盖道无而已，真常者指其无之实，而玄妙则赞其常之无也。老子见学术日歧，滞有泥迹，思以真常不变之道救之。”（老子第一章注）他说：“凡有起于虚，动起于静，故万物虽并动，卒复归于虚静。”（老子第十五章注）讲到历史和实际的政治社会问题时，他注重“实”，注重“变”，注重“动”。可是谈到哲学根本问题，他又以所谓“无”、所谓“真常”、所谓“虚静”为主了。这是他思想的唯心论的本质。因此，他所谓“实”、所谓“变”、所谓“动”，也就是浮浅的，不彻底的了。
    这是不足为奇的，因为在十九世纪中叶，中国的封建社会总崩溃还只是开始反映在思想方面，虽然像魏源这样的开明知识分子，也只能有不彻底的关于“变”“动”思想。在政治方面，他虽然称赞美洲没有君主的联邦政治制度，认为可以“垂之奕世而无弊”，但是他仍然要维持清朝的封建统治秩序，认为在这个基础上，就可以建设新式工业；倚靠清朝封建政权，就可以抵抗外国的侵略，这完全是一种幻想。
    事实证明，封建统治阶级只能使中国日益陷入半封建半殖民地的地位。只有在中国工人阶级和共产党的领导下，中国才完成了反封建主义反帝国主义的人民革命，走上社会主义工业化的大路。
    魏源逝世一百年了。经过一百年的奋斗，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，终于站起来了。独立自主、光荣富强的新中国，已经建立起来了。百年以来魏源等先进人士梦寐以求的，现在实现了。
    〔注〕一说魏源死于1856年，此据魏源的儿子魏耆作的“邵阳魏府君事略”。据“事略”，魏源生于乾隆59年3月24日，即1794年4月23日；死于咸丰7年3月1日，即1857年3月26日。（附图片）
