    Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 28th - Hong Kong's "Wen Wei Po" today published an editorial commemorating the tenth anniversary of the "February 28th" Uprising of the Taiwanese people, hoping that the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan would swiftly take action, adopt the same pace as the Taiwanese compatriots, abandon all prejudices and misgivings, and respond to the call of the motherland for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.
    The editorial said: "The Kuomintang military and government personnel, large and small, remaining in Taiwan, starting with Chiang Kai-shek, should feel the same deep pain as the Taiwanese compatriots regarding the ubiquitous and rampant behavior of American imperialism in Taiwan, as long as they possess conscience and patriotism."
    The editorial said that Premier Zhou had repeatedly expressed to the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek Group that as long as the Taiwan Kuomintang people can prioritize the interests of the nation and the people, get rid of the shackles of American imperialism, and return to the embrace of the motherland, a third cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is certainly achievable.
    The editorial said that the peaceful liberation of Taiwan is the unanimous demand of all the people of our country and the urgent desire of the eight million compatriots in Taiwan. "In order to realize the unification of the motherland, and in order to resist the cruel aggression of American imperialism against Taiwan, we are willing for all patriotic Taiwan Kuomintang military and government personnel to take swift action and strive to make contributions to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan."

    香港文汇报发表社论
    纪念“二·二八”十周年
    新华社香港28日电  香港“文汇报”今天在纪念台湾人民“二·二八”起义十周年的社论中，希望台湾国民党军政人员迅速采取行动，和台湾同胞采取同一步调，摒弃一切成见和疑虑，响应祖国和平解放台湾的号召。
    社论说：“留在台湾的国民党大小军政人员，从蒋介石起，只要他们具有良知和爱国心，对于美帝国主义在台湾的无孔不入和横行霸道，都应该会和台湾同胞同样感到万分痛心”。
    社论说，周总理曾经向台湾蒋介石集团再三表示，只要台湾国民党人能够以国家民族的利益为重，摆脱美国帝国主义的羁绊，回到祖国的怀抱，国民党和共产党的第三次合作是一定能够实现的。
    社论说，和平解放台湾是我国全体人民的一致要求，也是台湾八百万同胞的迫切愿望。“为着实现祖国的统一，为着反抗美国帝国主义对台湾的残酷侵略，我们愿所有爱国的台湾国民党军政人员迅速采取行动，争取为和平解放台湾立功。”
