Old Foes, New Rivals
　　Xí Línshēng

    Only ten years after the end of the war, West German monopoly capital has returned to the capitalist world market for fierce expansion. The re-emergence of this powerful competitor has intensified the contradictions between imperialist countries. Especially for Britain and France, the old foes have now become new rivals.

    Now let us examine how West Germany is increasingly squeezing out its old opponents.

    Several characteristics

    Since 1948, the development of West Germany's foreign trade has had the following important characteristics:

    1.  Rapid development. West Germany's rapid rate of foreign expansion ranks first in the capitalist world. The proportion of West Germany's total exports in the capitalist world has increased from 1.1% in 1948 to 7.5% in 1955. During the same period, the proportion of the United States decreased from 23.7% to 18.8%; the United Kingdom also decreased from 12.1% to 9.9%; and France only increased from 3.8% to 5.9%. In 1947, West Germany was almost completely squeezed out of the capitalist world market, ranking only twenty-sixth in capitalist world trade, but by 1955 it had surpassed France, ranking third after the United States and Britain. Now it is fiercely competing with Britain for second place.

    2.  The growth rate of exports far exceeds that of imports. In the early post-war period, West Germany's exports were small and imports were large, resulting in consecutive years of import surplus. However, since 1952, West Germany has reversed the situation of consecutive years of import surplus, becoming consecutive years of export surplus, and the numbers are getting larger and larger. The trade changes in the past few years can be seen from the following table:

                   Exports                    Imports
  Year  Unit:    Percentage Increase  Unit:      Percentage Increase
     Billion Marks   1950＝100   Billion Marks    1950＝100
  1950  8.4  100  11.4  100
  1951  14.6 174  14.7  129
  1952  16.9  202  16.2  142
  1953  18.5  220  16.0  141
  1954  22.1  264  19.3  170
  1955  25.7  306  24.5  215
1956 (estimated)31.0  369  28.0  246

    West Germany's huge foreign trade surplus in recent years has led to a sharp increase in its gold and dollar reserves, from 1.165 billion US dollars at the end of 1952 to more than 4 billion US dollars at the end of 1956. By the end of 1956, Britain's gold and dollar reserves were only a little over 2 billion US dollars. In the European Payments Union, West Germany has changed from a debtor country to the largest creditor country, with a total surplus of 2.12 billion US dollars. The United Kingdom has become the largest debtor country, owing more than 1.377 billion US dollars. In the international currency market, the West German mark has become a more popular currency than the British pound.

    3.  The structure of commodity exports has undergone important changes. In the early post-war period, West Germany's main exports were coal and timber, accounting for 50% of West Germany's total exports, while manufactured goods only accounted for 5% of exports. Soon, this situation was reversed, and manufactured goods became the main export products, accounting for 90% of all exports. Exports of food and industrial raw materials accounted for only 10%. Imports mainly consisted of food and industrial raw materials (accounting for more than 65% of all imported goods).

    This change in the structure of West Germany's exports has enabled it to catch up with or surpass other major capitalist countries in some important trading areas. In 1956, West Germany's machine exports exceeded those of Britain and ranked first in Western Europe. Automobile exports, which were far behind Britain, reached 96% of Britain's exports in the first nine months of 1956, and small car exports even exceeded Britain in the first few months of 1956, ranking first in the world. West Germany has also surpassed Britain in the export of ships and chemicals.

    4.  Along with the development of foreign trade, capital exports have also increased rapidly. In 1952, West Germany's annual capital exports were only 27 million marks, but by 1955 they had increased to 500 million marks. Since 1952, West Germany's total overseas investment has been nearly 1 billion marks, and its proportion has approached the level of the United Kingdom. Investment has spread to all corners of the capitalist world, including the established spheres of influence of the United States, Britain, and France.

    These characteristics of West Germany's foreign economic expansion show that West Germany is rapidly restoring its old imperialist position and drastically changing the balance of power in the capitalist world.

    Expansion situation

    The West European market occupies a primary position in West Germany's foreign trade. 70% of West Germany's exports are to this market. This region is also an important market for the United States, Britain, and France, especially Britain and France. In 1948, West Germany's exports to Western Europe were four times less than Britain's and 38% less than France's. However, by 1950, West Germany's exports to Western Europe exceeded those of France, and by 1951, they exceeded those of Britain, and by 1953, they even exceeded those of the United States. In 1955, West Germany ranked first in the foreign trade of Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Italy, and France, first in the imports of the Belgium-Luxembourg Union and Portugal, and first in the exports of the Netherlands and Spain. The United Kingdom only maintained its advantage in Denmark and Norway. West Germany has taken the lead in export trade to Western European countries.

    The second important market for West Germany's foreign trade is Latin American countries. It absorbs about 10% of West Germany's total exports. West Germany mainly exports manufactured goods to Latin America. In 1954, manufactured goods accounted for 93% of all exports. In the six years from 1948 to 1954, West Germany's exports to Latin America increased eighty-four times. In 1951, West Germany ranked fourth in exports to Latin America, but by 1953, West Germany surpassed Britain and France and jumped to second place, second only to the United States. West Germany has defeated Britain in Brazil and Argentina, the two most important markets for Britain in Latin America. The United Kingdom still has an advantage only in exports to Uruguay and Venezuela.

    In the Latin American market, West Germany has not only squeezed out Britain, but also posed a serious challenge to the United States. The American press has revealed that the United States' one-sided trade policy of dumping American goods in Latin American countries and generally being unwilling to purchase Latin American goods has caused widespread dissatisfaction among Latin American countries. West Germany is using this situation to squeeze out American influence. For example, the West German government has purchased large quantities of commodities from Latin American countries that are affected by American dumping or import restrictions, exceeding West Germany's needs, in order to win over Latin American countries. This strategy has achieved considerable success. Now West German monopoly capital has mastered the agricultural machinery market in Argentina and Brazil, and is squeezing out American competitors in the market for electrical equipment, paints and other commodities.

    The Middle East is also an important target for West Germany's foreign expansion. At present, it accounts for about a quarter of West Germany's overseas trade (i.e., excluding trade with Western Europe). Today, American and British monopoly capital still have a considerable advantage in the Middle East countries. However, the power of West German monopoly capital is growing rapidly. In the foreign trade of the ten major countries in the Middle East, West Germany has increased its share from 6% in 1951 to 17% in 1954, while the share of the United States has decreased from 32% to 25% during the same period, and the United Kingdom has also decreased from 31% to 26%. In these countries, West Germany has repeatedly threatened the leading position of the United States and Britain. West Germany once defeated Britain and the United States in Turkey's foreign trade and ranked first. By 1955, this top spot was taken by the United States because the United States increased its aid to Turkey. In Egypt and Iran, West German monopoly capital has used these two countries' anti-British sentiment to greatly infiltrate its own influence. From 1949 to 1953, West Germany's exports to Egypt increased twenty-five times. In 1953, West Germany surpassed Britain in Egypt's import trade. Later, Britain regained its leading position after strenuous efforts. Recently, due to the Suez issue, especially the failure of Britain and France in the war of aggression against Egypt, West Germany has been more actively expanding in this region.

    In the Southeast Asian market, West Germany's influence is not very strong due to competition from the United States, Britain, and Japan. However, it has surpassed France and is approaching Japan. In the first few years after the war, West Germany's trade with Southeast Asia was almost non-existent, but by 1955, West Germany's total trade with Southeast Asia was about twice the pre-war trade volume of Germany in this region. Moreover, in some important countries, the growth rate of West Germany's influence is quite astonishing. In 1954, West Germany's exports to Thailand were twenty times that of 1950. In 1955, West Germany's exports to India were seven times that of 1950. In all private imports to Pakistan, the share of the United Kingdom decreased from 33% in 1953 to 26% in 1955, while the share of West Germany jumped from 5% in 1951 to 10% in 1955.

    In other markets, such as North Africa, West Germany has also made considerable progress. West Germany's exports to French overseas territories in North Africa almost quadrupled in 1954 compared to 1950.

    In West Germany's foreign trade, the trade with the United States has always been unfavorable. At present, it is mainly an import surplus, and the trade deficit is very large.

    Favorable factors

    West Germany's rapid foreign expansion is primarily based on its rapidly growing economic strength. After the war, West Germany's industrial productivity developed rapidly due to large-scale investment and technological equipment renovation under the assistance of American monopoly capital. Now West Germany's industrial production ranks second in the capitalist world, and in some industrial sectors, such as steel, machinery, plastics, and synthetic rubber, the total value of production has surpassed Britain and ranks second. At the same time, since West Germany's military burden is lighter than that of other North Atlantic Treaty countries, it is able to use more of its strength for export competition.

    The low price of West German export commodities is an important weapon for West Germany in foreign competition. In many cases, West Germany's commodity prices are 5%-10% lower than the corresponding commodity prices of its competitors, and sometimes 15%-20% lower. In terms of machinery, it is even 30% lower than the United Kingdom. West German commodity prices are relatively low, mainly because West German workers' wages are much lower than those in other Western European countries, while labor productivity is much higher than in other countries. Lower wages plus higher labor productivity make West Germany's commodity costs lower than those of other countries, putting it in an advantageous position in competition.

    In addition, the West German government's assistance and subsidies for exports, as well as the assistance given by American monopoly capital to West German monopoly capital in some aspects in order to use West Germany to counter the influence of Britain and France, have also contributed to West Germany's foreign economic expansion to varying degrees.

    Future trends

    Although West Germany's foreign expansion has developed rapidly in recent years, some new signs have begun to appear in 1956, indicating that West Germany's expansion rate has slowed down somewhat. In the first five months of last year, the growth rate of West Germany's exports dropped from 22.6% in the same period of the previous year to 15.4%, and exports in July and August of last year even decreased month by month. Of course, these signs do not mean that the foreign expansion of West German monopoly capital has been curbed and cannot be developed further. However, it reflects that West Germany's expansion in major markets is, as West Germany's "Deutsche Zeitung and Wirtschaftszeitung" pointed out, "restricted by Western purchasing power" and is gradually approaching saturation. At the same time, it also reflects that the competition faced by West German monopoly capital in the capitalist world market is becoming increasingly fierce.

    Therefore, how to strengthen West Germany's advantages in the European market and expand its influence in other markets, especially in economically underdeveloped areas, has become the most concerned issue for West German monopoly capital.

    Active activities have been launched in this regard. A primary step is to organize a European Common Market with the other five countries of the European Coal and Steel Community. This is of great benefit to West German monopoly capital in establishing economic hegemony in Western Europe, and can pave the way for West German monopoly capital to infiltrate French overseas territories, especially Africa.

    Activities in economically underdeveloped areas have been given particular importance. West German Economics Minister Erhard believes in his so-called "New Strategic Market" plan that West Germany's economic expansion should not be limited to the narrow scope of the European continent, but should be expanded to new and diverse overseas markets, especially the colonies and dependencies of those old colonial countries in Europe. He also specifically advocates using the method of exporting capital to control the economic lifeline of these countries. To this end, West Germany has established various institutions to study the possibility of expanding trade with underdeveloped areas, and at the beginning of last year, it sent a large number of economic delegations to the Far East, the Middle East, and Latin America for inspections. Fritz Berg, chairman of the Federation of German Industries, also proposed a huge eight-point plan after visiting Southeast Asia to compete for the "huge market" in Southeast Asia. Krupp also proposed the so-called "Fourth and a Half Point Plan" to develop backward areas. Some newspapers reflecting the opinions of West German monopoly capital have bluntly pointed out that Britain and France have "ended forever" in the Middle East, and now is "the most favorable time for West Germany to conduct activities in the Middle East."

    It is worth noting in this regard that at the same time that the United States proposed the "Eisenhower Doctrine," some economic giants in the United States went to West Germany and West German big entrepreneurs such as Krupp to conduct business talks. Hamburg's "Der Spiegel" called these talks "the prelude to the joint German-American advance into the undeveloped areas of the Middle East." It seems that in the struggle to fill the so-called vacuum in the Middle East and further squeeze out the old colonial forces of Britain and France in Africa, Wall Street is willing to let West German monopoly capital act as a pioneer, and the industrial group in the Ruhr is also happy to conduct this "cooperation." It is conceivable that the struggle between the two groups of imperialist forces, the United States-West Germany and Britain-France, in the Middle East and Africa will become increasingly fierce. However, this does not mean that the contradictions between West Germany and the United States will be eased. On the contrary, on all major battlefields, especially in the competition in the Latin American market, West Germany will also increasingly become a serious enemy of American monopoly capital. The American "New York Times" once said: "The resurrected German industry has become the most dangerous enemy of the United States in the Latin American market." With the growth of West Germany's economic strength and the further strengthening of foreign expansion, the contradictions between West Germany and the United States will also become increasingly acute.

　　老冤家新对头
　　席林生
    战争结束才过十年，西德垄断资本又重新回到资本主义世界市场上进行凶猛的扩张。这个强有力的竞争者的重新出现，使得帝国主义之间的矛盾激化起来。特别是对英法来说，老冤家现在又成了新对头。
    现在我们来考察一下西德是怎样愈来愈有力地排挤着它的老对手们的。
    几个特征
    自1948年以来，西德对外贸易的发展有以下几点重要特征：
    一、发展快。西德对外扩张速度之快在资本主义世界堪称第一位。在资本主义世界输出总额中，西德所占比重已经从1948年的1.1％增加到1955年的7.5％。而同期美国的比重却从23.7％降到18.8％；英国也从12.1％降到9.9％；法国只从3.8％增加到5.9％。在1947年西德几乎完全被排挤出资本主义世界市场，它在资本主义世界贸易中仅居于第二十六位，但是到1955年却超过法国居美英之后而名列第三。现在它正在和英国激烈地争夺第二位。
    二、输出增长的速度远远超过输入。在战后初期，西德的对外输出很少而输入很多，连年入超。然而从1952年起西德却一反连年入超的情况，成为连年出超，而且数字越来越大。过去几年中间贸易变化的情况可以从下表看出来：
                   输出                    输入
  年份  单位：    增加百分比  单位：      增加百分比
     十亿马克   1950＝100   十亿马克    1950＝100
  1950  8.4  100  11.4  100
  1951  14.6 174  14.7  129
  1952  16.9  202  16.2  142
  1953  18.5  220  16.0  141
  1954  22.1  264  19.3  170
  1955  25.7  306  24.5  2151956（估计）31.0  369  28.0  246
    西德近年来对外贸易的巨大的顺差，使它的黄金美元储备急剧增加，从1952年年底的十一亿六千五百万美元增加到1956年年底的四十多亿美元。而1956年年底英国的黄金美元储备却只有二十亿多一点。在欧洲支付同盟中西德已经从债务国成为最大的债权国，共盈余二十一亿二千万美元。而英国却成为最大的债务国，积欠了十三亿七千七百多万美元。在国际货币市场上，西德的马克成为比英镑更吃香的货币。
    三、商品输出的结构起了重要的变化。在战后初期，西德输出的主要项目是煤和木材，占到西德输出总额的50％，而工业制成品只占出口的5％。不久，这种情况就颠倒过来，工业制成品成了主要的出口品，占到全部出口的90％。食品和工业原料的出口只占10％。输入方面主要为食品和工业原料（占全部进口商品的65％以上）。
    西德出口商品结构的这种改变，使它在一些重要的贸易方面赶上或超过其他主要资本主义国家。在1956年西德机器出口量已经超过英国而居西欧的第一位。原来远远落后于英国的汽车出口量在1956年头九个月中已经达到英国出口量的96％，其中小汽车的出口更在1956年头几个月中超过英国而居世界第一位。在船舶和化学品输出方面西德也已经超过英国。
    四、在对外贸易发展的同时，资本的输出也迅速增加。1952年时西德资本的每年输出额只有二千七百万马克，但到1955年已增加到五亿马克。从1952年以来西德对国外的投资总额将近十亿马克，所占比重已接近英国的水平。投资遍及资本主义世界各个角落，包括美、英、法的既有势力范围。
    西德对外经济扩张的这些特征说明西德正在迅速恢复它旧有的帝国主义地位，并急剧地改变着资本主义世界中力量对比的形势。
    扩张情况
    在西德对外贸易中占首要地位的是西欧市场。西德出口的70％都是输往这个市场的。这个地区同时也是美、英、法特别是英国和法国的重要市场。在1948年，西德对西欧的输出要比英国少四倍，比法国少38％。然而到1950年西德对西欧的输出额就超过了法国，到1951年超过了英国，1953年时更超过了美国。1955年西德在奥地利、瑞士、瑞典、意大利、法国的对外贸易中占着第一位，在比利时—卢森堡联盟和葡萄牙的进口中占第一位，在荷兰、西班牙的出口中占第一位。而英国只有在丹麦和挪威还占着优势。在对西欧国家的出口贸易中，西德已独占鳌头。
    西德对外贸易的第二个重要的市场是拉丁美洲国家。它吸收西德出口总额的10％左右。西德向拉丁美洲输出主要是工业制成品，在1954年制成品部分曾占全部输出品的93％。从1948年到1954年的六年中，西德对拉丁美洲的输出增加了八十四倍。在1951年西德在对拉丁美洲输出中还居第四位，但是到1953年西德就超过英法而跃居第二位，仅次于美国。在英国在拉丁美洲的最重要市场巴西和阿根廷两个国家中，西德都已经打败了英国。只是在乌拉圭和委内瑞拉的出口方面，英国还占有优势。
    西德在拉丁美洲市场上不只是排挤了英国，而且对美国也提出了严重的挑战。美国报刊曾经透露，美国向拉丁美洲国家倾销美国货而一般不愿购买拉丁美洲的货物的片面贸易政策，使拉丁美洲国家普遍感到不满。西德正在利用这种形势来排挤美国的势力。例如，西德政府曾经超过西德的需要，从拉丁美洲国家大量购买受到美国倾销或限制入口的影响的商品，以此拉拢拉丁美洲国家，这种策略已获得不小的成功。现在西德垄断资本已经掌握了阿根廷和巴西的农业机器市场，并正在电气设备、颜料等商品市场方面排挤着美国竞争者。
    中近东地区也是西德对外扩张的重要对象。目前它占西德海外贸易（即除去对西欧贸易）的四分之一左右。今天在中近东国家中，美英的垄断资本还占有相当的优势。但西德垄断资本势力正在快速地增长。在中近东十个主要国家的对外贸易中，西德已经从1951年所占的比重6％增加到1954年的17％，而同期美国所占的比重却从32％降至25％，英国也从31％降到26％。在这些国家里，西德曾一再威胁了美英的领先地位。西德曾经在土耳其的对外贸易中打败英美而占第一位。到1955年，由于美国增加了对土耳其的援助，这一首位才被美国夺去。在埃及和伊朗，西德垄断资本曾利用了这两个国家的反英情绪来大大渗入自己的势力。从1949年到1953年间，西德对埃及出口增加了二十五倍。1953年，在埃及进口贸易中，西德曾超过英国。后来英国经过力争，才又夺回了领先地位。最近由于苏伊士问题，特别是英、法在侵埃战争中遭到失败，西德更积极地在这个地区进行扩张。
    在东南亚市场上，由于美、英和日本的竞争，西德的势力还不十分大。但是它已超过了法国而接近于日本。在战后最初几年内西德对东南亚地区的贸易几近于无，但是到1955年，西德对东南亚地区的贸易总额已相当于战前德国对这一地区贸易额的两倍左右。而且在一些重要的国家中，西德势力增长的速度是相当惊人的。1954年西德对泰国的出口相当于1950年的二十倍。在1955年西德对印度的出口相当于1950年的七倍。在巴基斯坦全部私人入口货中，英国所占比重从1953年的33％降到1955年的26％，而西德所占的比重却从1951年的5％，跃升到1955年的10％。
    在其他市场上，例如北非地区，西德也获得了相当的进展。西德对北非法国海外领地的出口在1954年比1950年几乎增加了四倍。
    在西德的对外贸易中，迄今始终不利的是同美国的贸易。这方面目前还主要是入超，贸易赤字很大。
    有利因素
    西德对外的迅速扩张，首先是以它急速增长的经济实力为基础的。战后，由于西德垄断资本在美国扶助下大量进行投资和革新技术设备，西德工业生产力发展很快。现在西德的工业生产在资本主义世界中已居于第二位，而在若干工业部门，例如钢、机器、塑料、人造橡胶等的生产总值方面，已超过英国而居第二位。同时，由于西德的军备负担比较其他北大西洋公约国家来得轻，这就使它能够以较多的力量用于出口竞争。
    西德出口商品的低廉价格是西德在对外竞争中的一个重要的武器。在许多情况下，西德的商品价格都要比它竞争者的相应商品价格低5％—10％，有时低15％—20％。在机器方面它甚至比英国低30％。西德商品价格比较低廉，主要是因为西德工人的工资比西欧其他国家低得多，而劳动生产率却比其他国家高得多。较低的工资加上较高的劳动生产率就使西德商品的成本低于其他国家，而在竞争中处于有利的地位。
    此外，西德政府对出口的帮助和津贴，以及在某些方面美国垄断资本为了利用西德来对抗英法的势力而给予西德垄断资本的帮助，也在不同程度上有助于西德的对外经济扩张。
    今后的趋势
    虽然西德几年来的对外扩张是急速发展的，但是在1956年也开始出现了一些新的迹象，表明西德的扩张速度已有所减慢。去年头五个月西德出口的增长率已由前年同期的22.6％降到15.4％，而去年七、八两月出口还逐月有所减少。当然，这些迹象并不能说明西德垄断资本的对外扩张已经遭到遏止，不可能再有发展。但是它反映了西德在主要市场上的扩张正像西德“德意志日报与经济报”曾指出的：“已受到西方购买力的限制”，而日益接近于饱和的水平。同时它也反映了西德垄断资本在资本主义世界市场上所遇到的竞争已越来越剧烈了。
    因此，如何加强西德在欧洲市场上的优势，并在其他市场，特别是经济不发达地区中扩展自己的势力，就成为西德垄断资本最关心的事情。
    在这方面已经展开了积极的活动。一个首要的步骤就是同欧洲煤钢联营的其他五国组织欧洲共同市场。这对于西德垄断资本在建立西欧经济霸权方面有很大好处，并可以为西德垄断资本渗入法国海外领土特别是非洲开一条方便之路。
    对经济不发达地区的活动被放到特别重要的地位。西德经济部长艾哈德曾在他的所谓“新战略市场”计划中认为，西德的经济扩张应该不限于欧洲大陆这个狭小范围内，应该扩大到新的、多方面的海外市场，特别是欧洲那些老殖民国家的殖民地和附属国。他并特别主张用输出资本的办法来掌握这些国家的经济命脉。为此目的，西德成立了各种各样的机构来研究扩大对不发达地区贸易的可能性，并在去年年初派遣了大批经济代表团到远东、中东和拉丁美洲等地进行考察。西德联邦工业家联合会主席弗里茨·柏格在访问东南亚后并提出了庞大的八点计划，以争夺东南亚的“巨大市场”。克虏伯也提出了所谓开发落后地区的“第四点半计划”。一些反映西德垄断资本意见的报纸曾经露骨地指出，英、法在中东已经“永远完结”，目前是“西德在中近东进行活动的最有利的时机”。
    这方面值得注意的是，在美国提出“艾森豪威尔主义”的同时，美国一些经济界巨头曾到西德和西德克虏伯等大企业家进行商谈。汉堡“镜报”把这些商谈称为“德美共同向中近东未开发地区前进的序幕”。看来，在所谓填补中东真空并进一步在非洲排挤英法老牌殖民势力的斗争中，华尔街愿意让西德垄断资本来充当一名先锋，而鲁尔的工业集团也乐于进行这场“合作”。由此可以想见，美—西德和英—法这两伙帝国主义势力在中东、非洲的斗争将益趋剧烈。但是，这并不是说，在西德和美国之间，矛盾将会缓和下来。事情恰恰相反，在各个主要战场上，特别是在拉丁美洲市场的竞争上，西德也将日益成为美国垄断资本的严重敌手。美国“纽约时报”就曾经说：“复活的德国工业已经成了美国在拉丁美洲市场上最危险的敌手”。随着西德经济力量的增长和对外扩张方面的进一步加强，西德和美国之间的矛盾也将会越来越尖锐起来。
