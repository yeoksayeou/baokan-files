    A General's Good Wife, A Household's Good Housewife
    Han Xiangxin
    Comrade Zhai Ping, the mother of seven children, is the wife of a general at the Senior Anti-Aircraft Academy. She joined the revolutionary work in 1938 and the army in 1941. Two years ago, after the organization decided that she should retire from the army, she began her life as a housewife.

    In Comrade Zhai Ping’s home, an old sister-in-law in her fifties helps her take care of the children. However, being a housewife in a family with so many people is by no means an easy task. Her two eldest children attend middle school and come home during festivals and holidays; the third and fourth children attend elementary school; the fifth and sixth children are in day care at the nursery; and the youngest stays at home. Comrade Zhai Ping does not hire a nanny. She does the toilet cleaning, bathroom cleaning, house cleaning, cooking, and laundry herself. In the summer, her husband often needs to change shirts, and his military uniform also needs to be washed and ironed frequently; the children's clothes pile up quickly after they take them off. She has never spent money to send them to the laundry. She bought a sewing machine to make clothes for the whole family; sometimes, she stays up late sewing clothes for the children. Comrade Zhai Ping also purchased a set of barber tools, so the children don't need to go to the barber shop for haircuts. She said, "If I didn't do this, I would have to waste a lot of time with the children at the barber shop."

    Comrade Zhai Ping’s family has relatively good economic conditions, but she pays great attention to thrift. She and her children eat an average of forty or so kilograms of coarse grains each month. She manages the household very methodically, with a monthly economic expenditure plan, a rotating bathing schedule, and a weekly menu. The family's life is arranged in a very organized way.

    The more children she has, the more attention Comrade Zhai Ping pays to strengthening the management and education of her children. She maintains close contact with the school and the nursery. Except for the youngest, the children always make their beds and fold their blankets when they are at home, and they wash their own masks, handkerchiefs, and socks. Comrade Zhai Ping said, "This is not just about use, but about cultivating the children's ability to manage their own lives!" Her children are all very polite, always greeting their parents when they come home from school, and they rarely quarrel over small things.

    Zhai Ping and her husband have been married for sixteen or seventeen years and have never had any unprincipled quarrels. She always discusses things with her husband. They both have elderly parents who need to have money sent home. Although they have many children and a heavy financial burden, they are always happy to fulfill their duty to support their parents.

    In her spare time, Comrade Zhai Ping plays cards with her children, or takes them to play badminton in the yard, or go for a run on the playground. On Sundays, they sometimes watch a play or a movie. In the evenings, she often takes time to read newspapers and magazines.

    Since becoming a housewife, Comrade Zhai Ping has not diminished her enthusiasm for working for the Party. She serves as the Director of the Women's Committee of the school and the Party Branch Secretary. Once, the Women's Committee organized an evening party for the officers and soldiers. It was raining heavily, and Comrade Zhai Ping, while holding her child, checked the preparations for the performance. She also actively participates in voluntary labor, supports agricultural production cooperatives, and washes and sews clothes for the soldiers. (Attached photo)

    将军的好妻子　家庭的好主妇
    寒向新
    七个孩子的母亲翟平同志，是高级防空学校一位将军的妻子，她在1938年参加革命工作，1941年参加军队。前年，组织上决定她复员后，她就开始了家庭主妇的生活。
    翟平同志家里，有一位五十多岁的老嫂子帮助她照看小孩。可是在一个这么多人口的家庭里作主妇，终究不是一件轻快的事情。她的两个大孩子上中学，每逢节日假日回家；第三、第四个孩子上小学，第五、第六个孩子在托儿所日托，最小的留在家里。翟平同志没有请保姆，刷厕所、洗浴室、整理房子、做饭、洗衣服，很多事情都由她自己动手。夏天，她丈夫经常要洗换衬衣，军服也要常洗常熨；孩子们的衣服一脱下来就是一大堆，她都从来没有花钱送到洗衣房去洗。她买了一架缝纫机给全家人做衣服穿；有时候，为了给小孩们缝衣服，她一直忙到深夜。翟平同志还置了一套理发用具，孩子们理发都用不着上理发馆。她说：“要不这样做，我就得带着孩子们在理发店里浪费许多时间。”
    翟平同志家庭的经济条件是比较好的，但是她很注意节俭。她和孩子们每月平均要吃四十来斤粗粮。她管理家务很有计划，比如每月都有经济开支计划，有洗澡轮流表，还有每周菜谱，一家人的生活安排得很有条理。
    越是孩子多，翟平同志越注意加强对孩子的管理教育。她和学校、托儿所都保持着密切的联系。除了最小的一个以外，孩子们在家的时候，总是自己铺床叠被，自己的口罩、手绢、袜子都是自己洗。翟平同志说：“这不是单纯的使用，而是培养孩子们管理自己生活的能力！”她的孩子都很有礼貌，放学回来总是先向爸爸妈妈问好，平时也很少为一点东西吵吵闹闹。
    翟平和丈夫结婚十六、七年，从来没有无原则地吵闹过。有什么事情，她总是和丈夫商量着办。他们都有老人，需要往家里寄钱，虽然他们的孩子较多，生活负担较重，但是他们总是高高兴兴地尽自己赡养老人的义务。
    翟平同志在休息时间就和孩子们打打扑克，或者带着孩子在院子里打打羽毛球，到操场上去跑一跑。星期天，他们有时候看看戏或电影。晚上，还经常抽时间看看报纸、杂志。
    做了家庭主妇，翟平同志并没有减弱为党工作的热情，她担任校的妇女委员会主任委员、党的支部书记。有一次，妇女委员会为官兵们组织晚会，天正下着大雨，翟平同志一面抱着孩子，一面检查演出的准备工作。她还主动参加义务劳动，支援农业生产合作社，给士兵们洗衣服、缝衣服。（附图片）
