Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: The Polish Parliament plenary session reconvened on the 22nd.

    The meeting heard a report from Deputy Osinski (Polish United Workers' Party), representing the Parliament's Labor and Social Welfare Committee, on the "Bill on Abolishing Outstanding Compensation Claims Arising from Employment Contracts." The reporter stated that Parliament should require the government to conclude the work of adjusting labor and wage legislation so that no outstanding debts could arise in the future. The government should strive to strengthen the discipline and responsibility of various ministries in complying with labor and wage legislation and strengthen the management of government and ministerial expenditures. After discussion, the meeting passed the bill.

    The meeting also heard and discussed a report from Deputy Paulina (United Peasant Party), representing the Parliament's Internal Affairs Committee, on the bill to amend the law on changing rural administrative regions and establishing village people's councils, and unanimously passed the bill. The bill stipulates that the provincial people's councils shall henceforth have the power to change the boundaries of administrative villages and prescribe the number of seats in the rural people's councils without submitting decisions on these matters to the Council of Ministers for approval.

    At the same day's meeting, a bill was also passed to merge ten government ministries into five new ministries. This bill stipulates that the former Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and Ministry of Machine Building Industry, Ministry of Coal Mining and Ministry of Power Industry, as well as the Central Petroleum Bureau, Ministry of Construction and Ministry of Building Materials Industry, Ministry of Grain and Ministry of Procurement, Ministry of Railways and Ministry of Land and Air Transportation shall be merged into the Ministry of Heavy Industry, Ministry of Mining and Power Industry, Ministry of Construction and Building Materials Industry, Ministry of Food Industry and Procurement, and Ministry of Transportation, respectively. This is to meet the urgent needs of the national economy, strengthen coordination among relevant departments, reduce institutions, and save administrative expenses.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 23rd (by dispatch): The Polish United Workers' Party parliamentary group met on the 21st to discuss the "Bill on Abolishing Outstanding Compensation Claims Arising from Employment Contracts." This bill provides for the cessation of payments for overtime pay, over-collected income tax, and other arrears owed to employees by the state in past years.

    Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, spoke at the meeting. He said that these compensation claims, accumulated over many years, have become a very complex problem, which is impossible to resolve or provide a fair solution today. Many claims are completely unreasonable and unfounded. Furthermore, it is unjust to use the billions of zlotys that the state will save in the coming years to satisfy these claims.

    Gomułka said that in January and February of this year, the state's wage expenditure exceeded the projected figures by 1.2 billion zlotys. This figure is partly offset by increased production, but about 400 million zlotys are the result of violations of wage discipline. As the first two months have shown, the planned increase in currency circulation for the first quarter of this year will be greatly exceeded. The reason why this increase in currency circulation has not currently created a threat to complicate the market is due to the people's confidence in the people's regime and the economic stability of the country. But all this has its limits. The government must draw affirmative conclusions and take action on this phenomenon with an affirmative attitude.

    Gomułka said that last year, 1.44 billion zlotys were spent to compensate for various claims. An analysis of these payments shows that some of them were unfounded. We cannot continue to do this. I don't think it's difficult to explain this to the working class either. The issue of compensation claims cannot be studied solely from the point of view of whether to give or not. The state really has no way to do this, it cannot give or concede. It is said that last year there were many instances where money was paid out without justification under the pressure of strike threats. Giving in to the pressure of worker strikes and paying compensation for demands without studying the situation is an error in management. In our system, strikes are not a means of increasing workers' wages. Strikes can be, and sometimes are, an expression of the working class protesting against bureaucratic management methods, against the bureaucratic attitude of economic management authorities towards the working class. In this case, a strike is a signal that something has been done wrong, that these mistakes should be corrected. However, in this case, strikes cannot fundamentally change anything; on the contrary, they will worsen the current situation because we have nothing to offer.

    Gomułka said that we must remember that in 1956, wage expenditure increased by more than 15 billion zlotys compared to 1955, and according to the plan, 1957 will exceed the 1956 figure by more than 10 billion zlotys. In the current situation, it is impossible to further increase wage expenditure. He said that there is another problem, which is the issue of commodity quantities. For example, we import a large amount of butter, paying in foreign exchange. However, at the same time, our trading organizations have unsold lard that they cannot sell. We must consider how much money we spent on butter and how this has limited expenses in other areas (such as investment). Therefore, everyone can eat a little more lard and a little less butter. He emphasized that in this case, the entire truth should be explained to the working class and the Party organizations. Only in this way can the trust of the working class be gained.

    Gomułka concluded by saying: The current situation is difficult. We know that according to the plan, production will not increase much this year. Wage expenditure in the first two months was 39% higher than in the same period last year. We cannot deceive you or the people by saying that we are already able to formulate an improved plan today, that we are already able to say at what time we will do this and at what other time we will do that. Because the situation is such that no accurate assessment can be made on this point today. We can only act according to the general outlines. The more production, the more goods, the greater the possibility of further increasing workers' wages and constantly improving living conditions.

    波兰议会通过取消职工加班费补偿要求法案
    哥穆尔卡号召在发展生产基础上改善生活
    指出目前经济尚有困难，不能进一步增加工资
    新华社23日讯  波兰议会全体会议在22日复会。
    会议听取了议员奥辛斯基（波兰统一工人党）代表议会的劳动与社会福利委员会就“关于取消由工作合同引起的悬而未决的补偿要求的法案”作的报告。报告人说，议会应该要求政府结束调整劳工和工资立法的工作，以便将来不可能再发生任何悬而未决的债务。政府应该努力加强各部在遵守劳工和工资立法方面的纪律性和责任感，加强对政府和各部开支的管理。经过讨论以后，会议通过了这个法案。
    会议还听取和讨论了议员鲍林纳（统一农民党）代表议会内政委员会就修改关于改变乡村行政区和建立村人民会议的法律的法案所作的报告，并且一致通过了这项法案。这个法案规定，今后省人民会议有权改变行政村的边界以及规定农村人民会议的席次，而无须把关于这些问题的决定提交部长会议批准。
    在这一天会议上，还通过了关于把政府的十个部合并为五个新部的法案。这项法案规定把前冶金工业部和机器制造工业部、采煤部和动力工业部以及中央石油局、建筑部和建筑材料工业部、粮食部和采购部、铁道部和陆空运输部分别合并为重工业部、采矿和动力工业部、建筑和建筑材料工业部、食品工业和采购部及交通部等五个部，以适应国民经济的迫切需要，加强有关部门的配合，减缩机构和节省行政开支。
    新华社华沙23日电据波兰通讯社讯：波兰统一工人党议会党团21日开会，讨论“关于取消由工作合同引起的悬而未决的补偿要求的法案”。这个法案规定停止交付过去几年国家欠发职工的加班费和多收所得税等欠款。
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡在会上发了言。他说，在许多年中所累积起来的这些补偿要求已经成为一个十分复杂的问题，今天不可能把它解决或者提供一个公正的解决办法。有许多要求是完全没有道理和没有根据的。此外，把国家将在今后的许多年中节约下来的几十亿兹罗提用来满足这些要求，这是不公正的。
    哥穆尔卡说，在今年1月份和2月份，国家的工资支出比预计数字多十二亿兹罗提。这个数字一部分为增加的生产所弥补，但是有约四亿兹罗提却是违反工资纪律的结果。正像头两个月所表明的，今年第一季度货币流通量的计划增加数字将大大超过。货币流通量的这种增加所以没有在目前造成一种使市场复杂化的威胁，是由于人民对人民政权、对国家的经济稳定抱有信心。但是这一切都有它的限度。政府必须得出肯定的结论，并且以肯定的态度对这种现象采取行动。
    哥穆尔卡说，去年，为了补偿各项要求而付出了十四亿四千万兹岁罗。对这些支付所作的分析表明，其中一部分是没有根据的。我们不能再这样做下去。我也并不认为很难向工人阶级说明这一点。要求补偿的问题不能单从给不给的观点来研究。国家的确没有办法这样做，不能给予或让步。据说，去年发生了许多在罢工威胁的压力下没有根据地付钱的情况。在工人罢工的压力下屈服，不研究情况就对提出的要求付给补偿，那就是管理方面的错误。在我们的制度里，罢工不是达到增加工人工资的手段。罢工可以是、而且有时候的确是工人阶级对官僚主义管理方式、对经济管理当局以官僚主义态度对待工人阶级的这种情况表示抗议的表现。在这种情况下，罢工就是一个信号表示有一些事情做错了，表示这些错误应当纠正。但是，在这种情况下，罢工是根本不能使事情有任何的改变的，它反而会使现在的情况恶化，因为我们拿不出任何东西来。
    哥穆尔卡说，我们必须记住，在1956年，工资支出比1955年增加了一百五十多亿兹罗提，而根据计划，1957年还要比1956年的数字超过一百多亿兹罗提。在目前情况下，工资支出是没有可能进一步增加的。他说，还有一个问题，这就是商品数量的问题。例如，我们大量进口牛油，用外汇支付。但是，同时我们的贸易机构却拥有滞销猪油无法出售。我们必须考虑，我们为牛油花了多少钱，由于这种原因我们使其他方面（例如投资）的费用受到了怎样的限制。因此，大家可以多吃一点猪油，少吃一点牛油。他着重地说，在这种情况下，就应该向工人阶级和党组织说明全部事实真象。只有这样才可以获得工人阶级的信任。
    哥穆尔卡最后说：目前的情况是困难的。我们知道，根据计划，今年的生产增加得不多。头两个月的工资支出比去年同一时期高了39％。我们既不能欺哄你们，也不能欺哄人民，说我们今天已经能够制定出一项提高的计划，说我们已经能够说出在什么时间里将作到这个在另一个时间里将作到那个。因为情况是今天不能对这一点提出任何准确的估计。我们只能按着大体的轮廓活动。生产得越多，货物数量越多，进一步提高工人工资以及经常改善生活状况的可能性也就越大。
