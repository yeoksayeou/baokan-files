Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, March 27th: Currently, over 41% of Albania's villages have established agricultural production cooperatives. At the beginning of last year, villages with established cooperatives accounted for only 11.9% of the country's total villages. Now, news of new cooperatives being established arrives daily.

The original cooperatives achieved great success last year, which greatly promoted the development of the cooperativization movement. In 1956, the total income of Albania's agricultural production cooperatives increased by 1.6 times compared to 1955, and the public accumulation fund increased by nearly one time. In some cooperatives, a member's remuneration for one work day could reach 300 leks (Albanian currency, formerly translated as liques) in cash, and they could also receive a large amount of payment in kind. Last year, the income of the Kakreni Cooperative in the Fier region reached 16 million leks, and the income of the Poyani Cooperative in the Korçë region reached 15 million leks. Previously, only a very small number of cooperatives had annual incomes reaching 5 million leks.

　　阿尔巴尼亚近半数农村建立农业社
    新华社地拉那27日电　阿尔巴尼亚目前已经有41％以上的村庄建立了农业生产合作社，去年年初，建立了合作社的村庄在全国村庄中只不过占11.9％。现在，每天都有成立新合作社的消息。
    原有的合作社在去年取得了巨大成绩，这大大促进了合作化运动的发展。1956年，阿尔巴尼亚农业生产合作社的总收入比1955年增加了一点六倍，公积金增加了将近一倍。在有些合作社里，社员一个劳动日的报酬可以得到三百列克（阿币名，前译里克）的现金，另外还可以分得大量实物。去年，费埃里区的卡克雷尼合作社的收入达到了一千六百万列克，科尔察州的颇亚尼合作社收入了一千五百万列克。以前，只有很少数的合作社一年的收入达到了五百万列克。
