Should Not Violate National Regulations

The relevant departments in Heilongjiang Province once stipulated that institutions, organizations, schools, or individuals should not purchase industrial products at wholesale prices. The purpose was to increase accumulation for the country. However, relevant personnel from the CPC Jiamusi Municipal Committee机关 did not comply with this regulation. In October of last year, they purchased 250 tons of coal from Shuangyashan Coal Mine, paying at the wholesale price of seven yuan per ton, causing the state to lose 2,500 yuan in revenue. The relevant departments raised their opinions, but the matter has not been resolved to this day. Zhang Zhiyuan

    不该违反国家规定
    黑龙江省有关部门曾经规定：机关、团体、学校或者个人，购买工业产品，都不能按批发价格。目的在于为国家增加积累。但是，中共佳木斯市委机关的有关人员不遵守这个规定，在去年10月间向双鸭山煤矿买煤二百五十吨，按批发价每吨七元付款，使国家少收入二千五百元。有关部门提出意见，至今还没有解决。　张志远
