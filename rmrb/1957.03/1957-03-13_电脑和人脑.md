Some people seem to find it extremely easy to grasp policy principles. They don't do anything that isn't explicitly stipulated, they don't take measures that aren't listed in the regulations, they don't talk about principles that aren't mentioned in the "People's Daily" editorials. What they do and say is well-founded and steady, and thus they "implement" the guidelines and policies. They do this themselves and require others to do the same; they do this in administrative work and also in academic research. They pride themselves on this and use it to measure others.

The seventh issue of "Middle School Student" in 1956 published a science fiction story called "Computer." The child of an electrical engineer was always scatterbrained. His father made a computer and put it on his head. As a result, the child became "smarter," and his schoolwork "improved significantly." He could use the computer to memorize everything the teacher said, and he answered fluently when the teacher asked him questions. However, he failed the geography exam because the teacher had only talked about the major cities along the railway from Manchuria to Guangzhou, while the exam question was "What major cities would you pass through if you took the train from Guangzhou to Manchuria?"

It is indeed appropriate to use this science fiction story as a footnote for dogmatists. Dogmatists may have long hoped that scientists would invent something like a computer to "mechanize" themselves, so that others only need to work once, and they can be permanently at ease. Therefore, this science fiction story may disappoint these people, because even with a computer, children who don't use their brains still can't avoid failing exams.

But that doesn't matter, failing an exam is just a hypothetical situation. What exists in reality is the electronic computer, which can already replace some of people's simple thinking and is constantly being improved. One day, it may be able to completely replace human thinking, right? People who don't want to use their brains can avoid the pain of thinking. Unfortunately, there is one problem that can never be solved: if people don't use their brains, where does the electronic computer come from? Since the electronic computer is the result of human thinking, how can the electronic computer replace human thinking? No matter how advanced the machine becomes, it cannot replace human thinking after all; otherwise, there would be no need for humans to exist.

Marxism-Leninism is a universally applicable truth, but to formulate national guidelines and policies with it, it is necessary to combine it with specific circumstances. Correct guidelines and policies can ensure that the country advances victoriously towards great socialism and communism, but the implementation of guidelines and policies must go through various tasks. The words of Marxism-Leninism cannot directly replace guidelines and policies, and guidelines and policies cannot directly replace various tasks. Understanding guidelines and policies based on the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism, and carrying out various tasks according to guidelines and policies, all require human labor and human thinking. There will never be a computer or electronic computer that masters the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism and implements various guidelines and policies.

Dogmatists are not incapable of thinking (the ability to think is a human characteristic), but unwilling to think. They should recognize the great role of human thinking, not be stingy, and start their brains, which will surely have miraculous effects.

    电脑和人脑

    有些人看来，掌握政策原则实在是十分容易的事情。没有明白规定的事情不去做，规定中没有列举的办法不采取，“人民日报”社论中没有提到的道理不谈，做的和说的有根有据，四平八稳，方针政策就可“贯彻”。自己这样做，也要别人这样做；在行政工作中这样做，对于学术研究也这样做。以此自负，也用以衡人。
    “中学生”1956年第七期刊载了一篇科学幻想故事“电脑”。一个电机工程师的孩子一向没头没脑，他的爸爸做了一个电脑套在他的头上。这孩子于是“聪明”起来，学校功课大有“起色”。他能借助电脑全部记住老师讲过的话，老师问他什么，他对答如流。但是他应试地理交了白卷，因为老师只讲过从满洲里到广州沿铁路的大城市，而考试题目却是“从广州乘火车到满洲里，要经过哪些大城市？”
    把这科学幻想故事用作教条主义者注脚，实在恰当不过。教条主义者也许老早就希望科学家发明电脑一类的东西把自己“机械化”起来，别人只需一劳，自己就可永逸了。因而，这个科学幻想故事未免使这些人遗憾，就是真的有了电脑，不用脑筋的孩子在考试中仍未能免于交白卷。
    这也不要紧，交白卷不过是假设的事情。现实存在的，有电子计算机，已经能够代替人一部分简单的思维，还在不断加以改进。有朝一日，总可完全代替人的思维吧？不愿多动脑筋的人，大可免于思维之苦了。可惜有一个问题永远不能解决：人不动脑筋，电子计算机又从何而来？既然电子计算机是人的思维的结果，电子计算机又如何能够代替人的思维？不管机器进步到什么程度，毕竟不能代替人的思维，否则，人实在没有存在的必要了。
    马克思列宁主义是放诸四海而皆准的真理，但是以之制定国家方针政策，还须结合具体情况。正确的方针政策能够保证国家胜利地向伟大的社会主义、共产主义前进，但是贯彻方针政策，必须经过各项工作。马克思列宁主义的词句不能直接代替方针政策，方针政策也不能直接代替各项工作。根据马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法来理解方针政策，根据方针政策进行各项工作，都需要人的劳动、人的思维。决不会有掌握马克思列宁主义立场、观点、方法和贯彻各项方针政策的电脑或电子计算机。
    教条主义者不是不能思维（能思维是人的特征），而是不愿思维，应该认识认识人的思维的伟大作用，不要吝惜，把脑筋开动起来，必有奇效。
