Xinhua News Agency, March 12th—The Jingxi Mining Bureau, with a small amount of investment, can increase its raw coal production next year by half of this year's planned production, namely one million tons. This is the result of the bureau's recent arrangement of this year's basic construction plan, based on the geological conditions of the coalfield, and fully tapping the potential for rapid increase in coal production. The investment for increasing the production of one million tons of raw coal next year will only require 3.9 million yuan. Compared with building a pair of large-scale mines with the same production capacity, the investment is about 25 million yuan less, and the coal output time is four to five years earlier.

　　A portion of these increased investments will be used to increase the roadways, transportation capacity, and mining tools of existing production mines. For example, the Muchengjian mine of the Datai Mine will spend 900,000 yuan this year to develop an inclined roadway and increase some coal mining tools, so that it can produce 300,000 tons more coal next year.

　　Another part of the investment is to expand the production capacity and advance the coal output of the original basic construction mines with suitable conditions. For example, the Anjiatan North Shaft Mine, which started construction in 1956, was originally designed with an annual production capacity of 200,000 tons and was scheduled to start producing coal in the fourth quarter of next year. Now, by increasing the investment by 700,000 yuan, the single-lane transportation road under the originally designed well will be changed to a double-lane road, and a coal mining area will be developed first. The designed annual output can be increased to more than 450,000 tons, and coal production can begin in the first quarter of next year.

### 京西矿明年可增产一百万吨煤

    京西矿明年可增产一百万吨煤
    新华社12日讯  京西矿务局用少量投资就可以使明年原煤产量比今年计划产量增加一半，即一百万吨。这是这个局最近在安排今年基本建设计划中，根据煤田地质条件，充分挖掘迅速增产煤炭的潜力所得出的结果。明年增产一百万吨原煤的投资，仅需三百九十万元。这同新建一对同样生产能力的大型矿井比较，投资约少二千五百万元，出煤时间又早四、五年。
    这些增加的投资，一部分用在增加现有生产矿井的巷道、运输能力和采掘工具方面。如大台矿木城涧矿井，今年花九十万元开拓一斜坡巷道，增加一些采煤工具，明年就可以多出三十万吨煤。
    另一部分投资，是使有条件的原有基本建设矿井扩大生产能力，提前出煤。如1956年动工建设的安家滩北立槽矿井，原设计能力年产二十万吨，明年第四季开始出煤。现在增加七十万元投资，把原设计的井下单巷运输道改为双巷道，先开拓一个采煤区，设计年产量即可提高到四十五万吨以上，并且可以提前在明年第一季度开始出煤。
