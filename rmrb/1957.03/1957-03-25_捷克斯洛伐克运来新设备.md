Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 24th: Shanghai's machinery industry has received its first large lathe measuring eight meters in length, a giant planer measuring three meters wide and six meters long, and a large boring machine with an upper and lower stroke of three meters.

　　These are new pieces of equipment shipped from Czechoslovakia to the Shanghai Turbine Factory and the Shanghai Electrical Machinery Factory.

　　More than one-third of the new equipment at the Shanghai Turbine Factory and the Shanghai Electrical Machinery Factory is now made in Czechoslovakia. This equipment has enabled the two factories to successfully manufacture 6,000 kW and 12,000 kW turbo-generators.

　　Currently, the eight-meter-long large lathe is being installed at the Shanghai Electrical Machinery Factory. In the future, it will be used to process the rotors of 25,000 kW turbo-generators, which are nearly one meter in diameter. The giant planer, measuring three meters wide and six meters long, has been successfully test-run at the Shanghai Turbine Factory with the guidance and assistance of Czechoslovak experts Kang Qiula and Bulangdi. The design work for the 25,000 kW turbo-generator is currently underway at the Shanghai Electrical Machinery Factory, with all the design documents and data supplied by Czechoslovakia.

　　捷克斯洛伐克运来新设备
    据新华社上海24日电　上海机械工业第一次有了八公尺长的大车床，三公尺阔六公尺长的巨型刨床和上下行程三公尺的大搪床。
    这些是捷克斯洛伐克给上海汽轮机厂和上海电机厂运来的新设备。
    上海汽轮机厂和上海电机厂现在三分之一以上的新设备都是捷克斯洛伐克制的。这些设备使这两个厂顺利地制造出六千瓩和一万二千瓩汽轮发电机。
    现在，八公尺长的大车床正在上海电机厂安装。将来，直径接近一公尺的二万五千瓩汽轮发电机转子要由它来加工。三公尺阔六公尺长的巨型刨床在捷克斯洛伐克专家康秋拉和布朗梯指导帮助下，已在上海汽轮机厂顺利地进行了试运转。二万五千瓩汽轮发电机的设计工作正在上海电机厂进行，全部图纸资料都是由捷克斯洛伐克供应的。
