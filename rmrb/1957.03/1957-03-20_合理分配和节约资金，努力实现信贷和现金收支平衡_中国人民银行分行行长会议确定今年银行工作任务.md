    Xinhua News Agency report: The People's Bank of China has proposed that this year's banking work must be conducive to continuing to alleviate the tense situation of the nation's cash and material supply.
    The meeting of branch heads of the People's Bank of China, which concluded today, believes that the main task of banking work in 1957 is to implement the Central Committee's instructions on the campaign to increase production and practice economy, strive to increase revenue, actively support the funding needs of industrial and agricultural production increase and expanded commodity circulation, and on this premise, earnestly pay attention to the rational allocation of funds and conservation of funds, and strive to achieve a balance of credit and cash revenue and expenditure this year, in order to continue to alleviate the tense situation of the nation's cash and material supply.
    This meeting discussed this year's commercial credit work and rural financial work, and determined that the guiding principle for the supply of commercial credit funds for banks this year is to fully support the funding needs of major agricultural and sideline product purchases and import and export trade in accordance with the state-approved commodity circulation plan, support commercial departments in replenishing commodity reserves, and ensure market stability, while striving to conserve the use of funds.
    The central task of rural financial work this year is to support the improvement and consolidation of agricultural cooperatives and to support the realization of this year's agricultural harvest. To accomplish this task, three links must be grasped in the work: First, rationally use agricultural loans. On the one hand, the 900 million yuan of agricultural loans that can be issued this year must be issued well, and on the other hand, the existing nearly 4 billion yuan of agricultural loan funds must be managed well, so that they can be rationally circulated, which requires paying attention to the recovery of agricultural loans that are due and the clearing of loans issued in the past at all times. Second, consolidate and improve existing credit cooperatives, actively carry out business, and improve the style of work, so that they can play a greater role in regulating rural funds. The meeting affirmed that credit cooperatives still have a long-term need to exist, so it is necessary to adhere to the policy of running cooperatives for the long term, and achieve democratic and thrifty management under centralized leadership, and strive to consolidate credit cooperatives within two or three years. Third, all rural financial workers are required to earnestly study policies, deeply understand the rural economic situation, and timely summarize the experiences in their work, so as to do a better job in this year's rural financial work.

    合理分配和节约资金，努力实现信贷和现金收支平衡
    中国人民银行分行行长会议确定今年银行工作任务
    据新华社讯　中国人民银行提出，今年的银行工作必须有利于继续缓和国家现金和物资供应紧张的局面。
    今天结束的中国人民银行分行行长会议认为，1957年银行工作的主要任务是贯彻执行中央关于增产节约运动的指示，努力增加收入，积极支持工农业增产和扩大商品流转的资金需要，在这个前提下切实注意合理分配资金和节约资金，努力实现今年的信贷和现金收支平衡，以便继续缓和国家现金和物资供应的紧张局面。
    这个会议讨论了今年的商业信贷工作和农村金融工作，确定今年银行商业信贷资金供应的方针，是根据国家批准的商品流转计划，充分支持主要农副产品采购和进出口贸易的资金需要，支持商业部门充实商品储备，保证市场稳定，同时力求节约资金使用。
    今年农村金融工作的中心任务是支援农业社的提高和巩固，支援今年农业丰收的实现。要完成这个任务，在工作上必须抓住三个环节：第一，合理运用农业贷款。一方面要把今年可放的九亿元农业贷款放好，另一方面要把现有的将近四十亿元农贷资金管理好，使它合理周转，这就要求随时注意收回到期农贷和清理过去发放的贷款。第二，巩固和提高现有信用社，积极开展业务，改进工作作风，使它在调剂农村资金上发挥更大作用。会议肯定信用社仍有长期存在的必要，因此必须坚持长期办社的方针，做到在集中领导下民主办社和勤俭办社，争取两三年内把信用社巩固起来。第三，要求所有从事农村金融工作人员认真研究政策，深入了解农村经济情况，及时总结工作中的经验，把今年的农村金融工作做得更好。
