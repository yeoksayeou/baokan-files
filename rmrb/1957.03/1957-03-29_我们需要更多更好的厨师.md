　　We Need More and Better Chefs
　　Zhi Qing
    The catering industry is an indispensable part of the lives of the masses. According to preliminary estimates, the turnover of the national urban catering industry will increase by about one-half between 1956 and 1962. Developing the catering industry requires not only certain equipment, but most importantly, a sufficient number of employees; and among the employees, chefs play a decisive role in the business. But what is the current situation of chefs in our country?

    Generally speaking, the number is very small, and there is no one to follow in their footsteps. In terms of quantity, according to incomplete statistics from cities such as Xi'an, Tianjin, and Beijing, the number of chefs accounts for only 4% to 5% of all catering employees. Tianjin, a city with a large population, has only 315 chefs, of whom only about 20 have high-level skills. The Dongsi Canteen in Beijing has only one chef who can make Peking duck. A canteen in Harbin has a total of 14 employees, of whom only one is a chef, who has to cook an average of 200 jin of meat and 50 fish every day, working until his arms are red and swollen, with no one to replace him. But the more serious situation is that there is no one to follow in their footsteps. The average age of chefs in Beijing is about 50 years old, and there are very few young chefs; 70% of the chefs in Jilin City are over 40 years old. At present, many job seekers are unwilling to engage in the catering industry, and some of the existing staff in the catering industry are not content with their work. At the end of last year, the catering industry in Tianjin planned to recruit 400 employees. According to statistics from the first two days of registration, more than 70% of the 200-plus people who were preparing to work were women, and most of them were middle-aged or older, with very few young people. The Beijing Labor Bureau assigned 20 people to the Xuanwumen Canteen, but only five were left when they started work, one of whom set up his own small stall and refused to come even after the catering company invited him three times. These facts show that the existing chefs in our country, especially senior chefs, cannot meet the needs of the existing catering industry. This situation has already brought some negative effects. Many areas (especially emerging industrial and mining areas) should have expanded their business or set up new supply points according to needs, but they had to abandon their plans to expand catering supplies because there were not enough chefs. Because chefs are overworked, it also affects their health and work mood; because chefs are busy, they don't have time to teach others to learn skills, which makes the growth of new chefs very slow.

    How did the situation of a small number of chefs and no successors come about? In the early days of liberation, some chefs changed careers due to the temporary depression of the catering industry; but the main reasons are as follows: First, society does not value the chef profession. At present, many people still regard catering work as an inferior job with no future. The catering industry itself also despises chefs. There is a popular saying in the catering industry in Beijing: "First-class hall, second-class counter, no one wants to go to the kitchen." There is a popular doggerel in the catering industry in Wuhan: "In the previous life, you beat your father and cursed your mother, and in this life, you are demoted to the kitchen, suffering from smoke and fire, wearing tattered clothes." Second, the working conditions are poor, and the wage system is not reasonable enough. General employees work more than 10 hours a day, and some even work 14 or 15 hours; there is very little vacation time throughout the year. Living and working conditions are also very poor. Many chefs can only sleep on the dining table during lunch and evening breaks. The kitchen is generally very narrow, with poor ventilation, and the temperature is particularly high in summer, which has a great impact on health. In addition, there are also unreasonable aspects in the wage system, such as the wages of skilled chefs being similar to those of general service personnel. Third, the work of training chefs is weak. After the overall public-private partnership of the catering industry, except for a few areas, the leading departments of the catering industry in most areas have not taken into account the training of chefs, have not made plans, and lack effective training methods.

    In order to train a large number of chefs with considerable skills to meet the needs of current and future business development, the following practices can be used as a reference, based on the experience of some regions.

    Raise the awareness of the importance of the catering industry in society, so that everyone can correctly view and respect the glorious labor of catering personnel. Relevant leading departments at all levels should appropriately improve the political status of catering personnel. Last year, some chefs were invited to attend the National Political Consultative Conference, which greatly encouraged catering personnel. It is also necessary to strengthen political and ideological education among catering personnel so that they love their work. Active elements who have achieved success in the catering industry should be given timely political praise and material rewards. Where possible, the welfare and working conditions of employees should also be improved, and a necessary vacation system should be implemented; some unreasonable wage systems should also be adjusted appropriately. These measures are all very necessary to encourage the enthusiasm of the majority of employees and encourage more people to be willing to engage in catering work.

    Adopt various forms to train new people and improve the skills of existing chefs with lower skills. According to the experience of various places, advocating apprenticeship is a relatively easy and effective method. A master can lead several apprentices, and advocate a good atmosphere of respecting teachers and loving apprentices. Teachers, especially those who have made significant achievements in teaching and learning, should be given political encouragement and material rewards. Yang Yonghe, an old chef at the Youyishun Restaurant in Beijing, enthusiastically taught his apprentices. Now these apprentices can not only operate independently, but also take on new apprentices. Carrying out organized and planned business learning under the unified leadership of the city is also a good method. Tianjin organized a Technical Research Committee, and set up four professional groups (Chinese and Western food, pasta, bean food, fruit) under the committee to study advanced operating techniques and compile recipes, which has achieved good results. Wuhan has also established a system of chef experience exchange meetings, and regularly holds meetings to study experience and promote technology. Guangzhou held a catering exhibition, and organized chefs from many regions to exchange experiences and observe each other at the meeting, which also achieved good results. In addition, some regions are currently trying to run chef training classes and experimental restaurants (operating while teaching), and these practices can promote the work of training chefs.

　　我们需要更多更好的厨师
　　志庆
    饮食业是广大群众生活中不可缺少的行业。据初步估计，全国城市饮食业的营业额到1962年要比1956年增长二分之一左右。发展饮食业，除了需要一定的设备外，最主要的是要有足够的从业人员；而在从业人员中，对业务起决定性作用的则是厨师。但目前我国的厨师情况是怎样的呢？
    总的说来是数量很少，后继无人。在数量方面，据西安、天津、北京等城市的不完全统计，厨师人数仅占全部饮食业从业人员的4％到5％。人口众多的天津市，仅有厨师三百十五人，其中有较高技术的不过二十人。北京市东四食堂只有一个厨师会烤鸭。哈尔滨市有一个食堂共有职工十四人，其中仅有一位厨师，每天平均要做二百斤肉和五十条鱼的菜，累得胳膊红肿也没人代替。但是更严重的情况是后继无人。北京市厨师平均年龄约在五十岁左右，青年厨师很少；吉林市的厨师有70％是四十岁以上的人。目前有许多找职业的人不愿从事饮食业，而现有饮食业中的一些人员也不安心自己的工作。天津市饮食业在去年年底准备招收四百名工作人员，据报名开始两天的统计，准备参加工作的二百多人中，有70％以上是妇女，并且多是中年以上的人，青年人很少。北京市劳动局分配给宣武门食堂二十人，到上班时只剩下五个人了，其中有一名厨师自己摆小货摊，饮食公司请了三次都不肯来。这些事实说明，我国现有的厨师特别是高级厨师是不能满足现有饮食业的需要的。这种情况已经带来了一些不好的影响了，许多地区（尤其是新兴的工矿区）根据需要本来应该扩大营业或另设新的供应点，就是因为厨师不够，只好放弃扩大饮食供应的计划。因为厨师操作过分劳累，也影响了厨师的健康和工作情绪；由于厨师忙碌，没有时间去教导别人学习技术，就使得新的厨师生长很慢。
    厨师数量少，后继无人的情况是怎样产生的呢？解放初期，由于饮食业一度萧条，有部分厨师转了业；但是更主要的还有下面几个原因：一、社会上不重视厨师职业。目前许多人还把饮食业工作看做没有出息的下等活。在饮食业内部也很轻视厨师。北京市饮食业中流行这样一句话：“头等堂，二等柜，没人要的下厨房”。武汉市饮食业中流行这样一首打油诗：“前世打爹骂娘，今世贬下厨房，受的烟熏火燎，穿的破烂衣裳。”二、劳动条件差，工资制度不够合理。一般的从业人员每天工作总在十小时以上，有的甚至工作十四、五个小时；一年当中休假时间很少。居住和工作条件也很差，许多厨师在中午和晚间休息只能在饭桌上睡觉。厨房一般很狭窄，通风设备不良，特别是夏天温度高，对健康很有影响。此外，在工资制度上也有不合理的地方，如掌握技术的厨师的工资和一般的服务人员相差不多。三、培养厨师工作薄弱。饮食业全面公私合营以后，除了少数地区外，大部分地区的饮食业领导部门没有顾及到厨师的培养问题，没有做出规划，也缺少有效的培养训练办法。
    为了培养出大批的有相当技艺的厨师，以适应目前和今后业务发展的需要，根据部分地区的经验，下面的一些做法是可以参考的。
    提高社会上对于饮食业重要性的认识，使大家正确地看待和尊重饮食业人员的光荣劳动。各级有关领导部门要适当的提高饮食业人员的政治地位。去年全国政治协商会议开会时曾邀请了一些厨师出席，对饮食业人员起了很大的鼓励作用。在饮食业人员中还必须加强政治思想教育，使他们热爱自己的工作。对于饮食业中工作有成绩的积极分子要及时地给以政治表扬和物质奖励。在可能的条件下，还应该改善职工们的福利和工作条件，实行必要的休假制度；对某些不合理的工资制度也应该进行适当的调整。这些措施对鼓励广大职工的积极性，鼓励更多的人愿意从事饮食业工作，都是十分必要的。
    采用各种形式，培养新人和提高原有的技术较低的厨师。根据各地经验，提倡师傅带徒弟是一种比较易行而且有效的办法。可以让一个师父带若干名徒弟，并倡导尊师爱徒的风气。对于老师傅，特别是教导和学习有显著成绩的人，要给以政治上的鼓励和物质的奖励。北京市又一顺饭馆的老厨师杨永和曾热心教会了徒弟，目前这些徒弟不仅自己可以独立操作，并且又带新徒弟了。在全市统一领导下，进行有组织有计划的业务学习，也是一种很好的办法。天津市组织了技术研究委员会，在委员会下面设立了四个专业组（中西餐、面食、豆食、果子），分别研究先进操作技术，编制菜谱，已经收到了不小的效果。武汉市也曾建立了厨师经验交流会的制度，经常开会研究经验和推广技术。广州市曾举办了饮食展览会，会上组织了许多地区的厨师共同交流经验和互相观尝，也收到了很好的效果。另外，目前有些地区正在试办厨师训练班和实验饭店（一面营业，一面教学），这些做法都可以推动培养厨师的工作。
