Women of All Countries Actively Strive for Peace and Their Own Rights

    The "March 8th" International Women's Day, the annual review of the strength of working women and mothers around the world, has arrived again. Today, women all over the world are celebrating their festival with unprecedented unity in the forces against war and for peace. In the past year, millions of women have made significant contributions to stopping aggressive wars and have actively participated in the struggle for national independence and their own rights.
    One of the obvious signs of the development of the international women's movement is the increasing growth of various women's organizations and the continuous strengthening of their activities. When the Women's International Democratic Federation was established in 1945, it included only 80 million people in 40 countries, but now it maintains regular contact with women's groups in more than 80 countries and has more than 200 million members. In some countries in Asia and Africa, such as India, Indonesia, Japan, Nigeria, and South Africa, the rapid development of mass women's organizations is particularly striking. Among them, the Indonesian women's organization had only 6,000 members three years ago, but now it has increased to 500,000. Women in African countries such as Congo, Sudan, Senegal, and Ivory Coast are also organizing and participating more and more in international activities. From 1955 to 1956, a total of 53 women's congresses and national conferences were held around the world, which proves the frequency and scale of activities of various women's groups.
    The vast number of women, who account for half of the world's population, play an important role in the struggle against war and for peace. For example, women contributed greatly to the struggle against the British-French aggression against Egypt. The Women's International Democratic Federation issued a statement condemning the Western countries' policies on the Suez Canal issue and expressed its firm support for Egypt's struggle against aggression. The Soviet Women's Committee and the All-China Women's Federation also expressed their support for the Egyptian people. In order to safeguard the independence of the country and defeat the invaders, Egyptian women enthusiastically encouraged their husbands and sons to join the army, established women's training camps, and personally took up weapons to defend their motherland or perform rescue work. Their patriotic behavior has won the respect of people all over the world. Women were also an important force in the huge mass movement in Britain and France against the aggression against Egypt.
    Japanese women, who have suffered from the U.S. atomic and hydrogen bombs, represent the common desire of women in all countries in their demands to ban the testing and use of nuclear weapons. The Second Japanese Mothers' Congress held in August last year unanimously passed a resolution opposing the manufacture, testing and use of nuclear weapons and demanding the conclusion of an international agreement banning thermonuclear weapons. In October of the same year, about 500 mothers' representatives from all over Japan held a conference in Tokyo and decided to send Kubo Yama Suzu, the wife of Kubo Yama Aikichi, the first victim of the American hydrogen bomb, to New York to appeal to the United Nations General Assembly to stop the testing of nuclear weapons (later this was prevented by the United States). Women in other countries have also actively expressed their willingness to uphold peace and oppose the imperialist creation of international tensions. For example, West German women strongly protested against the militarization of the country and firmly refused to let their sons serve in the army. In many countries in the Middle East, such as Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria, women carried out various activities to oppose the Baghdad Pact. Women in India, Burma, Egypt, Syria, Cambodia, and Sudan wholeheartedly supported their governments' neutral policies because they knew that this policy was in line with the interests of peace.
    In recent years, women around the world have also actively participated in the anti-colonialist struggle. Women in Cyprus and Algeria joined the struggle for self-determination together with all the people, and were supported by people all over the world. In France, the call to stop the Algerian war is getting louder and louder. On March 24 last year, seventy women's delegations of various kinds from Paris and the suburbs visited the French Cabinet together and presented a petition with the signatures of more than 125,000 people demanding a peaceful solution to the Algerian issue. On October 13, about 500 representatives of women's organizations from thirty-two provinces in France held a gathering in Paris, demanding an end to the massacres in Algeria. British women also demanded that British troops withdraw from Cyprus.
    In Pretoria, South Africa, two thousand women, regardless of skin color, race, or belief, participated in a demonstration against racial discrimination for the first time in history.
    Striving for peace is the unanimous demand of women all over the world, because peace is the primary condition for improving life. However, in addition to this, women in capitalist and colonial countries must also fight for their own rights. They are carrying out increasingly widespread and resolute struggles to fight for women's right to work, for equal pay for equal work, against unemployment, and for the protection of the occupations of married women. Because in these countries, women still suffer from unequal oppression and discrimination. For example, according to official statistics: the average wage of female workers in the United States is 29% lower than the average wage of male workers, 39% to 41% lower in the United Kingdom, 14% to 17% lower in France, 37% lower in West Germany, 19% lower in Italy, and 56% lower in Japan. Female workers in colonial countries are paid even more meager wages. On the Ivory Coast in Africa, European female workers receive 25,000 francs for the same work, while African female workers only receive 6,500 francs. The plight of women is far more than this. Austrian law stipulates that female workers can receive pensions at the age of 60, but in reality, female workers are dismissed at the age of 40. In Argentina, many female workers suffer from occupational diseases due to the poor working conditions in factories. And once they have children, they are immediately kicked out of the factory. In the United States, Britain, France, and Japan, many factories have implemented "speed-up systems" and "automation," which make workers' labor too intense. Female workers, coupled with heavy housework, cannot recover from fatigue and age very early. The threat of unemployment also often falls on female workers first. The lives of female workers in colonial countries are even more pitiful.
    In terms of participating in social and political life, women in these countries are also completely unprotected. For example, Western countries have always touted equality between men and women, but female members of the French National Assembly account for only 3.6%, the Norwegian Parliament accounts for 4%, and the US Congress is even less at 3.3%.
    In socialist countries, women live a completely different life. They not only have obtained full rights and freedoms like men, actively participate in the life and work of the country, but also receive special care from the country. Among the representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, there are now 348 women, accounting for 25.8% of all representatives. Two thousand two hundred and nine women were elected as representatives to the Supreme Soviets of the various union republics and autonomous republics. Among the representatives of the local Soviets, there are more than 500,000 women. More than two thousand three hundred Soviet women have won the glorious title of Hero of Socialist Labor, and more than ten thousand women have obtained scientific degrees and glorious titles. Now, Soviet female workers who are 55 years old and have 20 years of service are entitled to receive the full amount of the prescribed pension. Since April 1 last year, the maternity leave for Soviet female workers has been increased to 112 days. The rest conditions for Soviet mothers are also getting better and better. In China, 17.3% of local administrative positions are held by women. The retirement age for female workers is ten years earlier than that for male workers (50 years old), and they can receive a retirement pension of 50% to 70% of their original salary per month. If female workers continue to work after reaching retirement age, they will receive a retirement pension equivalent to 20% of their salary in addition to their due salary. In Czechoslovakia, working women enjoy the right to 18 weeks of maternity leave and can receive a subsidy equivalent to 90% of their salary. Women in this country who are 55 years old are entitled to old-age pensions. Among the representatives to the people's congresses at all levels in Romania, there are 35,000 representatives who are women, and in the recent parliamentary elections, 71 women were elected as members of the National Assembly. In the past five years, more than 300,000 women in Romania have participated in industrial and agricultural production, and nearly 44,000 women have become advanced workers on the industrial front. In Bulgaria, 50,000 Turkish women who were oppressed before liberation have joined the Fatherland Front organization, and 350 of them have been elected as leaders of the Fatherland Front organizations at all levels. In the Mongolian People's Republic, female representatives to the Great People's Hural account for 22.4% of the total number of representatives. The number of female workers is also increasing, with a 10% increase in 1956 compared to 1955.
    The happy lives of women in socialist countries have shown women in capitalist and colonial countries the prospects and encouraged them to actively launch various struggles to fight for their own rights and strive for a better life.
    In April last year, the Council meeting of the Women's International Democratic Federation was held in Beijing. This was an important meeting that summarized the experience of the past ten years since its establishment and pointed out the future direction and tasks. In June of the same year, the first World Conference of Women Workers in the history of the international workers' movement was held in Budapest. Striving for equal pay for equal work between men and women, opposing discrimination against women, and extensively absorbing female workers to participate in trade union organizations and trade union leadership were the two main topics discussed at the conference. The results of the conference symbolized the great unity of women workers in the world, and thus had a positive impact on the struggle for women's liberation and social liberation, the international workers' movement, and the cause of world peace.
    With the development of the cause of world peace and the international workers' movement, under the leadership of the Women's International Democratic Federation, the democratic women's movement will continue to move forward by leaps and bounds. It will achieve greater success in developing cooperation between various women's organizations, fighting for women's rights, protecting children, and defending world peace. (Attached pictures)

    各国妇女积极争取和平和自身权利
    翁华
    作为一年一度检阅全世界劳动妇女和母亲们的力量的“三八”国际妇女节又来到了。今天，全世界的妇女是在反对战争、争取和平的力量空前团结的情况下来庆祝自己的节日的。在过去的一年里，数以百万计的妇女对制止侵略战争作出了重大的贡献，并且积极地参加了争取民族独立和自身权利的斗争。
    国际妇女运动发展的明显标志之一，就是各种妇女组织的日益壮大和活动的不断加强。国际民主妇联在1945年成立的时候，只包括四十个国家中的八千万人，可是现在它已经同八十多个国家的妇女团体保持着经常的联系，并拥有两亿多成员了。在亚洲和非洲的一些国家，如印度、印度尼西亚、日本、尼日利亚、南非，具有群众性的新的妇女组织的迅速发展都是特别惊人的。其中印度尼西亚的妇女组织三年前只有六千个会员，现在已经增加到五十万人了。非洲的刚果、苏丹、塞内加尔、象牙海岸等国的妇女也正在组织起来，并且愈来愈多地参与国际性的活动。从1955年到1956年，世界各地一共举行了五十三次妇女的代表大会和各国会议，这证明了各种妇女团体活动的频繁和规模的壮大。
    占世界人口一半的广大妇女在反对战争、争取和平的斗争中起着重要的作用。例如，在反对英法侵略埃及的斗争里，妇女就贡献了很大的力量。国际民主妇联曾发表声明，谴责西方国家在苏伊士运河问题上的政策，并表示坚决支持埃及反抗侵略的斗争。苏联妇女委员会、我全国妇联也都曾表示了对埃及人民的支援。埃及妇女为了维护国家的独立，打败侵略者，热情地鼓励丈夫和儿子参军，并且成立了妇女训练营，还亲自拿起武器保卫祖国或担任救护等工作，她们的爱国行为博得了全世界人民的尊敬。在英法两国国内反对侵略埃及的巨大群众运动中，妇女也是一股重要的力量。
    身受美国原子弹和氢弹之害的日本妇女，在禁止试验和使用核子武器方面的要求，更是代表着世界各国妇女们的共同意愿。去年8月举行的第二届日本母亲大会一致通过决议，反对制造、试验和使用核子武器，要求缔结禁止热核子武器的国际协定。同年10月，来自日本全国各地的约五百个母亲代表在东京举行大会，决定派美国氢弹的第一个牺牲者久保山爱吉的妻子久保山铃到纽约去，向联合国大会呼吁停止试验核子武器（后来由于美国的阻挠，未能成行）。其他国家的妇女们也积极表示了拥护和平、反对帝国主义制造国际紧张局势的意愿。例如，西德妇女曾强烈抗议国家的军国主义化，坚决表示拒绝让自己的儿子去服兵役。在中东的许多国家里，例如在伊拉克、黎巴嫩和叙利亚，妇女们进行了各种活动来反对巴格达条约。印度、缅甸、埃及、叙利亚、柬埔寨和苏丹等国的妇女，衷心拥护她们的政府所采取的中立政策，因为她们知道，这个政策是符合和平的利益的。
    近年来，世界各地妇女也积极参加了反殖民主义的斗争。塞浦路斯和阿尔及利亚的妇女和全体人民在一起参加了争取自决权的斗争，受到世界各国人民的支持。在法国，要求停止阿尔及利亚战争的呼声愈来愈高。去年3月24日，巴黎和巴黎郊区的七十个各种妇女代表团一起去访问了法国内阁，提出了十二万五千多人签名的要求和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的请愿书。10月13日，法国三十二个省的妇女组织的大约五百名代表在巴黎举行集会，要求停止在阿尔及利亚的屠杀。英国妇女也要求英军撤出塞浦路斯。
    在南非的比勒陀利亚，有两千个妇女不分肤色、种族或信仰在历史上第一次共同参加了反对种族歧视的示威运动。
    争取和平是全世界妇女一致的要求，因为和平是改善生活的首要条件。但是，除此之外，资本主义国家和殖民地国家的妇女还要为争取自己的权利而斗争。她们为争取妇女的工作权利、争取同工同酬、反对失业、要求保障已婚妇女的职业等进行着日益广泛而坚决的斗争。因为在这些国家里，妇女们仍旧遭受到不平等的压迫和歧视。例如，据官方统计：美国女工的平均工资比男工平均工资低29％，英国低39％到41％，法国低14％到17％，西德低37％，意大利低19％，日本低56％。殖民地国家女工的待遇更微薄。在非洲的象牙海岸，做同样工作，欧籍女工工资有二万五千法郎，非籍女工仅仅六千五百法郎。妇女的悲惨处境还远不止这一点。奥地利法律规定女工到六十岁可以养老，实际上女工做到四十岁就被解雇了。在阿根廷，由于工厂的劳动条件很坏，许多女工得了职业病。而且一旦有了孩子，马上就要被赶出工厂。在美国、英国、法国和日本，许多工厂实行了“赶快制度”和“自动化”，使得工人们的劳动过于紧张。女工再加上繁重的家务，疲劳更得不到恢复，很早就衰老了。失业的威胁也经常是首先降临到女工的头上。殖民地国家女工的生活就更可怜了。
    在参加社会政治生活方面，这些国家的妇女也完全得不到保障。例如，西方国家一向标榜男女平权，可是法国国民议会里女议员只占3.6％，挪威议会占4％，美国国会更少到3.3％。
    在社会主义国家里，妇女过的却是一种完全不同的生活。她们不仅和男人一样获得了充分的权利和自由，积极地参加了国家的生活和工作，而且还受到国家的特殊照顾。在苏联最高苏维埃代表中现在有三百四十八名妇女，即占全部代表的25.8％。两千二百零九名妇女当选为各加盟共和国和自治共和国最高苏维埃的代表。在地方苏维埃的代表中，有五十多万名妇女。两千三百多苏联妇女获得了社会主义劳动英雄的光荣称号，一万多名妇女获得了科学学位和光荣称号。现在，年满五十五岁和有二十年工龄的苏联女职工，就有权领取规定的全部养老金。从去年4月1日起，苏联女职工的产假已经增加为一百十二天。苏联母亲的休息条件也愈来愈好。在中国，地方行政职位有17.3％是由妇女担任的。女工退职养老年龄比男工提早十年（五十岁），每月可领取退职养老金原工资的50％到70％。女工达到退职养老年龄以后如果仍继续工作，她们除得到其应有的工资外，还得到相当于工资20％的退职养老金。在捷克斯洛伐克，劳动妇女享有产假十八个星期的权利，并可以领取相当于工资90％的补助金。这个国家年满五十五岁的妇女有权领取年老抚恤金。在罗马尼亚各级人民会议的代表中，有三万五千名代表是妇女，在最近的议会选举中又有七十一名妇女当选为国会议员。五年来，罗马尼亚有三十多万妇女参加了工农业生产，有差不多四万四千名妇女成为工业战线上的先进工作者。在保加利亚，解放前饱受压迫的土耳其族妇女已经有五万名参加了祖国阵线组织，其中三百五十名已被选为祖国阵线各级组织的领导人。在蒙古人民共和国，大人民呼拉尔的女代表占代表总数的22.4％。女工人数也在增加，1956年就比1955年增加了10％。
    社会主义国家妇女的幸福生活，给资本主义国家和殖民地国家的妇女展示了前景，鼓舞了她们积极地展开争取自身权利的各种斗争，来争取美好的生活。
    去年4月，国际民主妇联在北京举行了理事会会议。这是一次重要的会议，它总结了成立十年来的经验，并指出了今后的方向和任务。同年6月，在布达佩斯举行了国际工人运动史上的第一次世界女工会议。争取男女同工同酬，反对歧视妇女和广泛吸收女工参加工会组织和工会领导，是这次会议讨论的两个主要内容。会议的结果象征着世界女工的大团结，因而对争取妇女解放和社会解放的斗争、国际工人运动以及世界和平事业，产生了有利的影响。
    随着世界和平事业和国际工人运动的发展，在国际民主妇联的领导下，民主妇女运动将继续大步前进。它将在发展各种妇女组织之间的合作、争取妇女权利、保卫儿童和保卫世界和平的斗争中获得更大的成就。（附图片）
