I fully endorse Premier Zhou's and the Standing Committee's reports, as well as Vice Premier Li's explanation of certain issues concerning the Second Five-Year Plan. I am particularly excited and encouraged by Vice Premier Li's statement that "actively developing agriculture will create better conditions for developing industry," along with a series of related theories and guidelines. Now, I would like to share some of my own experiences in this regard and offer two suggestions for the government's consideration.

Vice Premier Li said, "We must consider both industrialization and the people, balancing current and long-term interests." This is the guiding principle for the country's industrialization. Furthermore, "developing heavy industry through the development of agriculture and light industry" is the method for realizing the aforementioned principle. As long as this method is thoroughly implemented, the principle will undoubtedly be realized, and certain contradictions in construction can be resolved simultaneously. Allow me to illustrate this with a simple example. If a farmer's annual grain yield is 700 jin, and the agricultural tax is 15%, amounting to 105 jin, the farmer is left with only 595 jin (including both means of production and means of livelihood). This creates a situation where both the state and the farmer have insufficient resources. However, if we start by striving to increase agricultural production, raising the grain yield by 50% to 1,050 jin, even after deducting the 15% agricultural tax, the farmer would still have 892.5 jin remaining. Even if the agricultural tax were increased to 20%, the farmer would still have 840 jin, while the state would receive 157.5 jin or 210 jin in grain tax, an increase of 50% to 100% compared to before. This would provide a greater supply of grain, raw materials for light industry, and goods for export, accelerating the development of both light and heavy industries. Farmers would also have the resources to purchase means of production and means of livelihood to expand reproduction and improve their lives. The expansion of farmers' reproduction and the improvement of their lives represent their current interests. The smoother and faster development of the country's production and construction represents the farmers' long-term interests. In this way, current and long-term interests, the interests of the people and the interests of the state, are fully integrated. Therefore, I believe that Vice Premier Li's theory and the method for realizing it represent a significant step forward in socialist political economy. This is why I feel so excited and encouraged.

The Party's General Line calls for socialist construction to be undertaken by the entire nation. Agricultural products and light industrial goods constitute the material foundation for mobilizing the entire people. We can mobilize a certain number of people (including school-age children) for construction based on the material resources we have. If we have a material foundation sufficient to supply the entire population, we can mobilize the entire nation. An increase in the number of people we mobilize means a reduction in the number of unemployed. When the entire nation is mobilized, unemployment will be eliminated. If we develop light industry, heavy industry, and education through agriculture, and if each sector supports and develops in coordination with the others, the development of our production can be confidently anticipated, and our socialist construction can advance by leaps and bounds.

Vice Premier Li said, "Agriculture is the main component of export goods." Why should we focus on export goods? Because in the early stages of our construction, we cannot wait to manufacture all the equipment for heavy industry ourselves; we inevitably have to import it from abroad. Similarly, we cannot wait for our own heavy industry to manufacture all the equipment for light industry; we inevitably have to import a portion of it from abroad. The more export goods we have, the more machinery and raw materials we can exchange for. The fewer export goods we have, the fewer machinery and raw materials we can exchange for. The more machinery and raw materials we have, the faster industry will develop. To strive for more export goods, we must strive to increase agricultural production. This is another example of the close relationship between agriculture and industry.

The above is my understanding of Vice Premier Li's "developing heavy industry through the development of agriculture and light industry." Below, I will offer two suggestions for striving to increase agricultural production.

(1) Please ask the state to further strengthen plans for developing more chemical fertilizer factories and constructing factories to manufacture machinery for chemical fertilizer factories, and prioritize creating conditions for developing these factories.

While there are many factors that contribute to increased crop production, the most important is fertilizer. Fertilizer is the food for crops, just as feed is the food for poultry and livestock. Meat from poultry and livestock is a transformation of feed, and grain is also a transformation of fertilizer. Therefore, to strive for increased production per unit area in rural areas, we must apply more fertilizer than is usually used. If we also want to increase the multiple cropping index, we must increase fertilizer in proportion to the multiple cropping index. Otherwise, a large multiple cropping area will be futile and may even lead to losses.

Fertilizers can be broadly divided into two categories: The first category is those that are taken from the soil and returned to the soil; all rural fertilizers belong to this category. The second category is those that are taken from the air or mineral deposits and added to the soil; the vast majority of chemical fertilizers belong to this category. We can diligently and meticulously accumulate all rural fertilizers and return them to the soil, which will certainly have a significant effect on crops. However, the fertilizer returned to the soil can never reach 100% of what is taken from the soil, so the fertility of the soil is always gradually decreasing year by year (this is a general statement). For example, human and animal excrement is what remains after humans and animals have taken part of the nutrients in food and feed for their own needs. Therefore, the fertility of excrement is less than the original fertility of food and feed, meaning that what is returned to the soil is less than what is taken from the soil. Moreover, during the fermentation of excrement, some nitrogen is lost, and the fertilizer is also partially lost due to erosion from wind, sun, and rain during storage. The fertility of the soil is also gradually lost due to soil erosion. During the initial stages of flooding in major cities each year, the water in rivers can be seen turning a dirty black color, flowing into the sea along the rivers and never being returned to the soil. Major cities often tend to become increasingly Westernized, promoting flush toilets, which also represents a significant loss of fertilizer. Based on the above examples, relying solely on the first category of fertilizer (rural fertilizer) to strive for large, continuous, and increasing production per unit area and in multiple cropping areas is difficult. However, mobilizing the entire nation to carry out socialist construction is an urgent task, so striving for a large increase in agricultural production is also an urgent task. We can only suggest that the government prioritize the development of the chemical fertilizer industry in the industrial sector (while simultaneously creating conditions for prioritized development), using all fertilizers taken from the air and from mineral deposits to support rural areas, so that the fertility of the soil is greatly increased, which will guarantee a large increase in agricultural production, and industry can develop more rapidly.

In addition to paying agricultural taxes and providing food for themselves, rural products are also used by farmers as exchange goods for means of production and means of livelihood. In the exchange process, farmers prioritize means of production, especially fertilizer. If the state manufactures large quantities of chemical fertilizer to exchange for farmers' surplus grain, not only will farmers be happy to accept it, but they can also use it to expand reproduction and support industry. Surplus grain must be exchanged to supply cities. If the state does not have large quantities of fertilizer to use as exchange goods, and instead tries to persuade farmers to exchange with industrial products that do not meet their needs, it will not only affect farmers' morale, but also hinder the expansion of reproduction in rural areas, which will in turn hinder industry, education, and everything else.

Last year, the People's Daily published a news item stating that workers at the Yongli Ammonium Sulfate Factory had successfully trial-produced high-pressure equipment for fixing nitrogen, and that the government was providing strong support. I was very excited about this news at the time, but upon closer reflection, the workers must have used the factory's repair shop to carry out the trial production, and its scale may be very small. Given our vast cultivated land, we must build large-scale specialized factories to produce large quantities of fertilizer factory machinery and equipment in order to solve the problem. Perhaps we could use this foundation to carry out expansion, which might be faster. However, before we can produce it ourselves or produce very little, we must first order some machinery from abroad, while creating various conditions domestically to ensure that the number of chemical fertilizer factories increases year by year. In this way, agricultural products will surely increase year by year, and industry and everything else can proceed smoothly.

Fertilizer has three characteristics: large quantity, high quality, and low price. Therefore, the key is to obtain materials locally, manufacture them locally, and supply them locally. Reducing long-distance transportation costs will make it suitable for the rural economy. Therefore, using foreign fertilizer cannot solve the problem.

(2) Please appropriately and formally train agricultural specialists to ensure increased production in rural areas.

In addition to the general lack of fertilizer in rural areas, there is also a lack of agricultural science and technology. Most farmers are unaware that fertilizers are divided into nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium. Even less do they know that various fertilizers should be rationally applied according to the different soil, climate, and crops. They believe that if they apply one type of fertilizer, they no longer need to apply other types of fertilizer. For example, the application of phosphate fertilizer in place of nitrogen fertilizer, resulting in reduced production, has been seen repeatedly. The promotion of improved varieties is an important current task, but in many places, due to a lack of agricultural technical personnel, it is blindly carried out without first conducting experimental work. For example, in 1956, Sichuan promoted the Yin Fang Geng rice variety, applying it rigidly and causing many production losses. The same mistake was made when promoting double-cropping rice. Furthermore, at the beginning of the establishment of cooperatives, many had poultry and livestock breeding organizations, but they often suffered complete losses due to epidemics, resulting in significant damage. Cultivating leguminous green manure can also fix nitrogen in the air, just like building a nitrogen fertilizer factory. However, in Sichuan, in addition to the long-term adoption in the western Sichuan plain, trial planting is still rare in other places. Even the state-run farms in various counties and cities have failed to conduct experimental demonstration work due to a lack of technology. Some have failed in trial planting of leguminous green manure, and instead of studying and improving it technically and in terms of variety, they have simply abandoned it. Soil testing and improvement are also the most important tasks, but they have not been carried out due to a lack of technical personnel. All of these phenomena can only be addressed by appropriately and formally training agricultural technical personnel to conduct experimental demonstration and promotion work in various counties and cities, and should focus on promoting leguminous green manure and advocating the use of organic matter to improve soil and cultivate bacteria, in order to compensate for the shortage of fertilizer.

Therefore, I strongly agree with Vice Premier Li's opinion that "graduates of rural higher primary schools who cannot continue their education should be given one or two years of additional agricultural technical education in their spare time so that they can engage in agricultural labor." However, I think that one or two years of part-time education may not be very effective. If they can be formally trained as junior specialists, learning one specialty, such as agricultural technology cultivation, soil fertilizer, disease and pest control, poultry and livestock breeding, soil and water conservation, or farmland water conservancy, or even dividing each specialty into more specific areas to seek specialization, it would be better. However, in addition to junior specialists, there is also a need for intermediate and senior specialists. Could a portion of the urban junior high school graduates who cannot continue their education, as mentioned by Vice Premier Li, be selected to be trained as intermediate agricultural specialists? Could the enrollment quotas of agricultural colleges be expanded to increase the number of senior agricultural specialists?

Increasing agricultural production is a complex and arduous task, and it is a long-term task. Of course, it is impossible to achieve it overnight, and I am not asking for it to be achieved overnight. However, it is necessary to develop industry through agriculture in order to eliminate many internal contradictions, and industry can develop smoothly and rapidly. This is an immutable truth. Furthermore, it is necessary to guarantee the increase of agricultural production through the two most important factors of agricultural increase: fertilizer and technology. Production can only be guaranteed in this way. Although we should not impatiently expect to immediately solve the need for large quantities of chemical fertilizer and the training of large numbers of agricultural technical personnel in rural areas, it seems to be an urgent task to quickly formulate plans and create conditions to continue to implement the plans.

As for the funding for building more chemical fertilizer factories and training agricultural technical personnel, I think it can be compensated for by increased agricultural production. Because agriculture is the main source of funding for mobilizing the entire nation, and it is also the main source of export goods for exchanging for foreign means of production. The capital invested in increasing its own production can of course be compensated for by the increased production and have a surplus.

Vice Premier Chen Yun said in his speech at the conference: "The government has decided that, in addition to launching large-scale pig farming, it will reduce pork exports by two-thirds in 1957 compared to 1956, and reduce edible oil exports." This is a manifestation of the government's special concern for the people. However, now is an important stage of national construction and development, and we should use all our efforts to increase export goods, and we do not want to reduce export goods to increase consumption. This lack of meat is also a temporary phenomenon, and it will gradually be resolved with various measures to increase meat. If the state continues to export pork and edible oil as usual, it can use this foreign exchange to purchase equipment for fertilizer factories. Furthermore, we should continue to collect export goods in all aspects and manufacture import goods that can be manufactured ourselves to reduce imports and strive for foreign exchange to develop the fertilizer industry and support the early completion of socialist industrialization.

Please criticize and correct the above speech. (Attached picture)

### 努力争取农业增产　颜心畬的发言

    努力争取农业增产
　　颜心畬的发言
    我完全拥护周总理及常务委员会的报告和李副总理关于第二个五年计划的若干问题的说明。我尤其对李副总理说明中
  “积极发展农业，也就为发展工业创造更好的条件”等一系列的理论和方针，感到无限的兴奋和鼓舞。现在我仅就我在这方面的体会发表一点意见，并提出两点建议，以供政府参考。
    李副总理说：“既要工业化又要人民，当前利益与长远利益兼顾”。这是国家实现工业化的方针。而“通过农业、轻工业的发展来发展重工业”就是实现上述方针的作法，只要能够彻底执行这个作法，上述方针是决定能够实现的，并且建设中的若干矛盾可以同时获得消除。我随便举个例子来说明这个问题，如农民每个人的粮食年产量为七百市斤，农业税征收15％为一百零五市斤，农民剩余的粮食就仅有五百九十五市斤（生产资料和生活资料都包括在内），就形成国家与农民两均不足。假如从努力增加农产着手，使粮食增加到50％成为一千零五十市斤，除农业税征收15％外，农民尚可剩余粮食八百九十二点五市斤，再假设把农业税增为20％，农民亦可剩余粮食八百四十市斤，而国家则可获得粮食税一百五十七点五市斤或二百一十市斤，比以前增加50％——100％，就可以得到粮食和轻工业原料与出口物资的更多供应，使轻工业和重工业的发展都更加迅速，农民也有力购买生产资料和生活资料来扩大再生产和改善生活，农民的再生产扩大了，生活改善了，就是它的当前利益。国家的生产建设得到更顺利更迅速的发展，就是农民的长远利益。这样，当前利益与长远利益、人民利益与国家利益就完全结合起来了。所以我觉得李副总理这个理论和实现这个理论的作法，在社会主义政治经济学上跨进了大大一步。我因而感到非常兴奋和鼓舞。
    党的总路线的号召，社会主义建设是要动员全国人民来进行的，农产品与轻工业品，就是动员全国人民的物质基础，我们有若干物质基础，就可以动员若干人民（包括读书的学龄儿童在内）来进行建设，如有足以供给全民的物质基础，就可以动员全国人民，我们动员的人数增加了，就是失业人数减少了，全国人民都动员起来了，就是失业消灭了。我们如通过农业以发展轻工业、重工业和教育事业，并且由各个部门相互支援相互发展，我们的生产发展是可以操券而待的，我们的社会主义建设是可以一日千里的飞跃前进的。
    李副总理说：“农业是出口物资的主要部分。”我们为什么要注重出口物资呢？因为我们在建设初期，所有重工业的设备，不可能等自己制造出来才建设，势必要从国外进口；轻工业的设备，也不能完全等自己的重工业把它制造出来才建设，势必也要向国外部分进口。我们的出口物资多，换回来的机器原料就多，出口物资少，换回来的机器原料就少，机器原料愈多，则工业的发展愈迅速，我们要争取出口物资多，就要努力争取增加农产，这也是农业密切联系着工业的一个例证。
    以上是我对李副总理的“通过农业轻工业的发展来发展重工业”的一点体会。以下我再提出争取农业增产的两点建议。
      （1）请国家再加强发展更多的化学肥料工厂的计划，和建设制造化学肥料工厂的机器的制造工厂，并优先创造发展这些工厂的条件。
    农作物增产的因素虽多，但其中最主要的是肥料，肥料是农作物的食粮，就犹之饲料是家禽家畜的食粮一样，家禽家畜的肉品是饲料的转化物，粮食也就是肥料的转化物，所以要争取农村单位面积增加生产，必须比较通常施用的肥料数量加多。若还要加大复种面积，则须比照复种面积的指数增加肥料。否则复种面积虽大也是徒劳无功，甚或还会招致损失。
    肥料可以大别为两类：第一类是取之于土壤者还之于土壤，所有一切农村肥料都属于这一类；第二类是取之于空气或矿藏者增加于土壤，所有绝大部分的化学肥料都属于这一类。我们能够勤勉细致的积聚一切农村肥料以还之于土壤，对农作物当然发生显著的效果，但还之于土壤的肥料，绝不能达到取之于土壤的100％，所以土壤中的肥份，总是逐年均有所减少（此系就全面说）。譬如人畜的排泄物，都是人畜把食品饲料中的养份取了一部分来给自己的需要后剩下来的。所以排泄物的肥份是比食品饲料原有的肥份少，即是还之于土壤者比取之于土壤者少。而且排泄物发酵期间，氮气要损失部分，在保存中受到风日雨水的侵蚀，肥份也要损失部分，土壤中的肥份，又逐年随水土的流失而流失。城市每年涨水的初期，可以看见河流的水变成污黑色。随江河而流入大海，这也是未能还之于土壤的部分肥料。各大城市，往往有逐渐欧化的趋向，提倡抽水马桶，这也是肥料的很大损失。就上述例子来看，仅靠第一类肥料（农村肥料）来争取普遍的单位面积和复种面积大量的、继续不断的增加生产是有困难的。但我们要动员全民来进行社会主义建设是刻不容缓的，所以争取农业大量增产也是刻不容缓的。我们只有建议政府，把工业部门的化学肥料工业优先发展起来（同时创造优先发展的条件），把取之于空气、取之于矿藏的一切肥料来支援农村，使土壤的肥份大量增加，则农产品可以保证大量增加，工业才可以得到更快的发展。
    农村的产品，除了缴纳农业税及农民自己的食用外，就是农民交换生产资料和生活资料的交换品。农民在交换中，首先重视生产资料，尤其是肥料，国家如制造出大量的化学肥料来交换农民的余粮，不但农民乐于接受，并且农民还可以借此扩大再生产来支援工业。余粮是必须交换来供给城市的，如国家无大量的肥料做交换品，而以不适合农民的需要的工业品来说服农民交换，不但会影响农民的情绪，而且会妨害农村的扩大再生产，也就妨害了工业、教育和其他一切。
    去年人民日报有一则消息说：永利硫酸铵厂的职工们，已试制成功固定氮气的高压设备，政府正在予以大力支援云云。我当时对这项消息极感兴奋，但仔细想来，职工们当然是利用该厂的修配厂来试制的，它的规模或者很小，而我们的耕地广大，必定还要建设大规模的专业工厂来生产，大量的肥料厂机器设备，才能够解决问题。或者就利用这个基础来进行扩建，或可较为迅速。但在自己尚未生产或生产甚少的时候，还须先向国外订购若干机器，一方面在国内创造各种条件，使化学肥料厂逐年均有多数的增加，则农产品必可逐年增长，而工业及其它一切亦可以顺利进行。
    肥料有三个特点：就是量要大，质要美，价要廉。所以重在就地取材，就地制造，就地供应。减少了远道运输的成本，才能适合农村的经济。所以采用国外肥料，也是不能解决问题的。
      （二）请适当的、正规的培养农业专材以保证农村增加生产。
    农村除一般都缺乏肥料外，还缺乏农业科学技术。一般农民多不知肥料有氮、磷、钾、钙之分，至于各种肥料要视土壤气候与作物之不同来合理施用，就更不晓得，它们以为施了一种肥料，就可以不再施他种肥料，譬如施用了磷肥就省了氮肥而弄成减产的事，曾经迭见不鲜，又如推广良种是当前的重要工作，而各地因缺乏农业技术人材，往往未先作试验工作即盲目进行推广，如1956年四川推广银枋梗稻，生搬硬套，造成了许多减产的损失。在推广双季稻时也犯了同样的错误。又如合作社建立之初，有很多有禽畜饲养组织，但往往一遇时疫，就弄得全部死光，造成重大损失。又如培养豆科绿肥也可以固定空气中的氮气，也如建设了氮肥工厂一样，但四川除川西平原多年采用外，试种的地方也还少，就是各县市的国营农场也因缺乏技术，多数未作试验示范工作，有的试种豆科绿肥失败了，也不从技术上品种上钻研改进，就把它搁置起来。又如土壤的化验和改良，也是最重要的工作，也因缺乏技术人员而未进行。所有这些现象，只有适当的、正规的培养农业技术人材，分别在各县市进行试验示范推广工作，并应注重推广豆科绿肥和提倡采用有机质来改良土壤，培养细菌，以补救肥料之不足。
    所以我极端赞成李副总理所说“农村高小毕业生不能升学的是否可以再施一两年业余的农业技术教育，以便从事农业劳动”的意见。但我觉得一两年的业余教育，诚恐发生的效力不大，如能把它们正规的培养成初级专材，学一样专业，如农业技术栽培、土壤肥料、病害虫害、禽畜饲养、水土保持、农田水利等各专一科，或者把每科再分细一些来求专精，但除初级专材之外，还要有中级和高级的专材。是否可以从李副总理所说的城市初中毕业生不能升学的当中划出一部分来培养成中级农业专材，再扩大农学院的招生名额以增加农业的高级专材。
    农业增加生产是复杂而艰巨的事情，是长期的事情，当然不可能一蹴而跻，我也不是要求一蹴而跻，但必须通过农业以发展工业，才可以消除很多内部的矛盾，工业才可以顺利而迅速的发展，这是一定不移的道理。而又必须通过农业增产最主要的肥料和技术两个因素来保证农业的增加生产，生产才可以获得保证。我们虽然不应该急躁的期望立刻解决农村的大量化学肥料的需要和大量农业技术人材的养成，但从速作成计划和创造条件，以期按照计划继续实现，则似乎是当前的迫切任务了。
    至于多建化学肥料工厂和培养农业技术人材的经费，我想是可以于农业增产中获得补偿的。因为农业就是动员全民的经费的主要来源，也是换取国外生产资料的出口物资的主要来源，为它本身增加生产而投下的资本，当然可以于它增加的生产中获得补偿而有余裕的。
    陈云副总理在大会发言中说：“政府已经决定，除了发动大量养猪以外，在1957年度比1956年度减少猪肉出口量的三分之二，减少食油出口”，这是政府特别关怀人民无微不至的表现，但现在是国家建设发展的重要阶段，我们应该用尽一切努力来增强出口物资，而不愿缩减出口物资来增加消费，这个肉食不足，也是暂时的现象，随着各种增加肉食的措施，逐渐就可获得解决。如国家对猪肉和食油照常出口，就可以利用这项外汇来进行肥料厂设备的购买。并且我们还应该再在各方面搜集出口物资和自制可能制造的进口物资来减少物资进口以争取外汇来发展肥料工业，以支援社会主义工业化的提早完成。
    以上发言请各位同志予以批评指正。（附图片）
