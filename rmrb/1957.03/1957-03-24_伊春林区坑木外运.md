　　Yichun Forest Area Pit Prop Shipment

　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Yichun Forest Area workers overfulfilled the first quarter pit prop supply plan by 7% on March 15th. Now the transportation department has begun to transport the second quarter's pit props from Yichun to coal mines in Hegang, Shuangyashan, and other places in advance.

　　Since the beginning of this year, Yichun Forest Area has placed the supply of pit props to coal mines in a primary position. Workers are giving priority to transporting pit props from the logging areas; when processing timber in the storage yards, they also prioritize producing pit props.

　　The phenomenon of logging sites carelessly discarding treetop wood, which was common in the past, is now rarely seen. Workers are hauling or carrying treetop wood and branches that can be used as pit props from the logging areas. This year, Yichun Forest Area will increase the production of 50,000 cubic meters of secondary pit props annually just by utilizing treetop wood and branches.

　  伊春林区坑木外运
    据新华社讯　伊春林区职工在3月15日超额7％完成了第一季度坑木供应计划。现在运输部门已经开始从伊春紧张地往鹤岗、双鸭山等地煤矿提前运送第二季度的坑木了。
    今年以来，伊春林区把供应煤矿坑木放在首要地位。职工们从山场都尽先抢运坑木；在贮木场造材的时候，也先把坑木造出来。
    过去伐木场乱扔梢头木的现象现在已经很少看见。工人们把能做坑木的梢头木和枝桠都从山场拉下来或扛回来。伊春林区今年仅是利用梢头木和枝桠这一项，全年将能增产五万立方公尺二级坑木。
