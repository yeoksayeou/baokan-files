Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, March 26th: Mongolian language experts have recently initiated discussions in the Mongolian "Truth Daily" concerning the revision of the new Mongolian script.

　　Damdinsüren, one of the compilers of the new Mongolian script's grammar, first published an article stating that the past ten years of using the new Mongolian script based on Russian letters have proven that the grammar suits the Mongolian language. However, it is still too simple, and the orthography defining the spelling of the new Mongolian script is also incomplete. Therefore, the main issue is how to enrich the new grammar. He opposes modifying the letters of the new Mongolian script, arguing that although the letters have shortcomings, they are convenient for Mongolians to learn Russian.

　　Deputy Doctor of Linguistics, Deshig, disagrees with Damdinsüren's opinion. In his article, he expressed that the letters and orthography of the new script are inconsistent and contain many aspects unsuitable for Mongolian grammar. He proposed replacing the four vowels in the new Mongolian script that do not conform to Mongolian grammar with seven letters from the old Mongolian script and criticized the compilers of the new grammar for complicating the originally easy-to-learn Mongolian grammar.

　　Linguistics expert Lubsangdendev's article stated that the rigid application of Russian letters in the new Mongolian script has restrained their own language.

　　These articles were published in response to the Mongolian Council of Ministers' decision to establish a New Script Grammar Revision Committee, after the Mongolian "Truth Daily" solicited opinions from language experts and the public. It is reported that differing opinions on revising the new Mongolian script will continue to be published, and a special meeting is planned in April to discuss the revision issues.

　　蒙古语文专家讨论修改新文字
    据新华社乌兰巴托26日电　蒙古语文专家们最近就修改蒙古新文字问题先后在蒙古“真理报”上展开了讨论。
    蒙古新文字文法的编写者之一、达木丁苏伦首先发表文章，他认为蒙古在使用俄文字母的新蒙文字以来的十多年间，证明文法是适合蒙古语言的，但是还过于简略，规定新蒙文的拼写法的正字法也不完整，因此主要问题是如何充实新文法。他反对修改新蒙文的字母，虽然字母有缺点，但是对蒙古人学习俄文很便利。
    语文学副博士第什格反对达木丁苏伦的意见。他在文章中表示新文字字母和正字法不统一，不适合蒙古语法的地方很多。他提出应该以旧蒙文中的七个字母来代替新蒙文中不合蒙古语法的四个元音，并且批评新文法的编写者把原来容易学习的蒙古文法复杂化了。
    语文学专家鲁布桑登得布的文章说，由于新蒙文生硬搬用俄文字母的结果，使自己的语言被束缚住了。
    这些文章是在蒙古部长会议决定成立新文字文法修改委员会以后，经过蒙古“真理报”向语文专家和群众征求意见而发表的。据悉，修改新蒙文的不同意见将继续发表，并且计划在4月里开会专门讨论修改问题。
