I would like to offer some personal opinions on the issue of birth control. If there are any inappropriate points, please correct me.

Our country is the most populous nation in the world. Especially in the years since liberation, due to the great improvements in the country's economic, cultural, and health conditions, the population growth rate has also significantly increased. While the continuous growth of the population signifies the prosperity and flourishing of the nation, on the other hand, the country is currently in a period of large-scale economic construction, requiring a vast number of cadres, workers, and farmers to play an active role. However, some cadres, workers, and farmers, due to having too many children and facing excessive living burdens, are not only adversely affected in their work, study, and health, but their family happiness and the upbringing of their children also encounter many difficulties and obstacles. At the same time, although the country's industrial and agricultural production is gradually increasing each year, and our living standards are improving, this is inevitably affected by the rapid increase in population, meaning our lives are not improving as markedly as they could. Therefore, the vast number of cadres, workers, and farmers urgently demand birth control at present. This demand is reasonable and appropriate, conforming to the current interests of the people and also suitable for the long-term interests of the country and the people.

In recent years, thanks to the Party and the government's attention to this issue, as early as August 1953, the Government Administration Council instructed the Central Ministry of Health to propose birth control measures, point out contraceptive methods, and revise the artificial abortion regulations. Although great results have been achieved so far, the demands of the masses have not yet been fully met.

How can we achieve the goal of birth control?

1.  It is suggested that the state revise the marriage age in the Marriage Law and make a decision after extensive and in-depth discussions across the country to unify understanding. Currently, many young people marry before the age of twenty, resulting in many difficulties in work, study, and life, especially in rural areas, where some even marry below the age stipulated in the Marriage Law. This phenomenon not only promotes early childbearing and easy over-reproduction, but also affects physical health and work and study. Therefore, it is recommended that all relevant departments conduct extensive and in-depth publicity and education throughout the country to break the bad habit of early marriage and advocate that men should marry at 25 and women at 22 as appropriate ages. Because doing so is of great benefit to work, study, life, and economy.

2.  Currently, many people are willing to undergo artificial abortion for birth control instead of actively using various contraceptive methods. This should be noted. One must know that even if artificial abortion is performed by experienced doctors, it is inevitable that it will harm the body. Especially for those who demand birth control, if they all rely on artificial abortion to solve the problem, then medical personnel will be overwhelmed, and a serious strain will inevitably occur on the turnover of hospital beds. At the same time, it will cause a great waste to the country. Therefore, we should not regard artificial abortion as the main method of birth control. This method can only be applied to necessary situations and cannot be used universally. As for performing sterilization surgery (ligation of fallopian tubes and vas deferens), although it is the most effective method of contraception, it must be decided based on individual conditions, such as those with serious illnesses and those who have given birth to many children, according to the procedures prescribed by the state. It is more appropriate not to blindly demand and arbitrarily perform it.

3.  During the lactation period of women, when menstruation does not arrive on schedule, most people think that pregnancy is impossible, but from our experience, there is still the possibility of pregnancy during this period. Therefore, one should not be negligent during this period and should also use contraceptive methods for safety.

4.  Several incorrect understandings must be overcome in the use of contraceptive methods.

    1.  Some people lose confidence because they think the effect is not accurate. This is a one-sided idea. One must know that although the various contraceptive methods currently promoted cannot achieve 100% effectiveness, as long as one can patiently try them, they can indeed have a certain degree of reliability and can achieve the purpose of planned parenthood and reduce fertility.

    2.  Some people also have a fear of trouble when using contraceptive tools and medicines. This is also inappropriate, because the word "control" means that it is a conscious action. Since one is consciously doing it, one must of course pay a certain price in labor, as well as do a good job of preparation before and disposal work after. Otherwise, it is difficult to achieve the expected results.
    
    3.  Some people also reflect that the use of contraceptive tools (such as condoms) is considered to have an impact on the health of both men and women. From a medical point of view, there is no reliable basis for this statement. Even if there is an impact, if it is limited to the period when it is easy to conceive (equivalent to the ovulation period), then there is no need to have any concerns about these problems. It is hoped that attention will be paid to widely publicizing and utilizing them.
    
    4.  What the vast number of people urgently demand in terms of birth control now is that the methods should be simple to use, accurate and long-lasting. For example, one injection or one dose of medicine can maintain a certain period of time without pregnancy. Of course, this ideal is very good, but to date, outstanding medical scientists in various countries have not yet researched more effective methods and medicines to fully meet everyone's requirements. In order to achieve the purpose of contraception, other advanced countries in the world are also using the same methods. Therefore, in the current stage, it is still necessary to widely use the existing contraceptive tools and medicines as appropriate methods of contraception.

    5.  From the above situation, although there are many methods in birth control, absolute results have not been obtained, and thus the needs of the people have not been completely met. In order to achieve this goal, it is hoped that our medical research workers and traditional Chinese medicine research comrades will further strengthen the in-depth research on related contraceptive methods in order to contribute more effective methods, thereby achieving the wishes of the vast number of people.

### 多方面努力达到节制生育的目的　袁安全、杨振国的联合发言

　　多方面努力达到节制生育的目的
　　袁安全、杨振国的联合发言
    现在仅就关于节育问题发表一点个人意见，不当之处，请各位委员指正。
    我国是全世界人口最多的国家，尤其是解放后几年来，由于国家在经济、文化、卫生各方面条件大大的改善，因而人口的增殖率，也显著的提高。人口不断的增长，虽然表示着民族的繁荣和兴旺，但另一方面目前国家正当大规模经济建设时期，需要广大的干部、职工、农民发挥积极作用，可是有些干部、职工、农民由于子女过多，生活负担过重，不仅是自己的工作学习和身体健康受到不利的影响，而且他们的家庭幸福生活，和对子女的教养，也有很多困难和妨碍，同时国家工农业生产虽然每年逐渐增加，我们的生活水平得到提高，但由于人口增加速度较快，我们生活获得显著的改善和提高，就必然受到影响。因此现在广大干部、职工、和农民同志们，当前迫切都要求节制生育，这个要求是合理的，也是应当的，既符合于人民的当前利益，也适合于国家和人民的长远利益。
    几年来，由于党和政府重视这个问题，早在1953年8月政务院曾经指示中央卫生部，提出节育措施，和指出避孕方法，及修订人工流产办法，到现在虽然收到很大效果，但是还未能全部满足群众的要求。
    怎样才能达到节育的目的呢：
    一、建议国家修订婚姻法的结婚年龄，并通过全国广泛深入讨论统一认识后再作出决定，目前很多青年不到二十岁就结了婚，结果造成工作上、学习上、生活上，发生很多困难，尤其在农村中，甚至还有低于婚姻法规定的年龄而结了婚。这种现象，不仅是促成生育过早，和容易子女生育过多，同时也影响了身体健康和工作与学习。因此，建议各有关部门，在全国范围内，必须广泛深入的进行宣传教育，打破早婚的恶习，提倡男子二十五岁女子二十二岁为适当的结婚年龄。因为这样作，对工作上、学习上、生活上、经济上均是有很大好处的。
    二、目前很多人为了节育均愿作人工流产，而不积极利用各种避孕方法，这是应当注意的，要知道作人工流产即或通过有经验的医生去作，也难免对身体没有危害。尤其是要求节育的人员，若都依靠人工流产来解决的话，那对医务人员应接不暇，和医院病床周转势必发生严重紧张现象，同时也给国家造成很大的浪费，因此我们尚不应当以人工流产作为节育的主要方法，这个方法仅可适用于必要的情况，不可普遍使用；至于施行绝育手术（输卵管和输精管结扎），虽然是避孕最有效的方法，但必须根据个人条件，如属严重疾病，和子女生育较多者，可按国家规定手续来决定，尚不可盲目要求和任意施行，较为妥当。
    三、在妇女哺乳期内，月经未能按期来潮时一般人认为不可能妊娠，但从我们经验来看，在这个时期仍然有妊娠的可能，因此在这个时期更不应当疏忽也要使用避孕方法以期安全。
    四、在使用避孕方法上必须克服几种不正确的认识。
    1．有些人认为效果不准确，就丧失了信心，这是片面的想法，要知道现在宣传的各种避孕方法虽然不能达到百分之百的效果，只要能够耐心试用，确实能有一定程度的可靠性，并能得到有计划的生育，和减低生育的目的。
    2．也有些人使用避孕工具和药品时，存在怕麻烦思想，这也是不应当的，因为节制二字，就意味着它是有意识的行动，
  既然有意识的去作，当然必须付出一定劳动代价，以及作好事前准备和事后处置工
  作，不然就很难达到预期的效果。
      3．又有人反映说：使用避孕工具，（如阴茎套）认为对男女双方的健康有影  响，这种说法从医学观点来看，尚没有可靠的根据，即或有影响的话，如只限于容易受胎时期（相当于排卵时期）使用，那么这些问题更不需要有任何顾虑了，尚希广泛宣传注意利用。
    4．现在广大人民对节育方面迫切要求的是，在方法上使用简单，效力准确又能持久，比如注射一次针，或吃一剂药就能维持一定时期不再妊娠，当然这个理想，是很好的，但是到目前为止，各国高明医学家，尚未研究出来更有效的方法和药品，来全部满足大家的要求，现在世界上其他先进国家为了达到避孕目的，也是同样的采用这种方法，因此在目前阶段仍须广泛利用现有的避孕工具和药品作为避孕的适当方法。
    5．从以上情况来看，虽然在节育问题上有了很多方法，但尚未得到绝对的效果，因而未能彻底满足人民的需要，为了达到这个目的，希望我们医学研究工作同志们和中医研究同志们，再进一步加强对有关避孕方法，深入研究，以便贡献出更有效的办法，从而达到广大人民的愿望。（附图片）
