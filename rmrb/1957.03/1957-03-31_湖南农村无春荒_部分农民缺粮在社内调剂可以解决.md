Every year, around the Spring Festival, before and after spring plowing, and before the wheat harvest, the grain situation in rural areas often becomes somewhat tense. In the past, people called this tense period before rice planting the spring famine period, and the period from rice planting to the new harvest the summer famine period. In order to accurately grasp the current grain situation in rural areas, relevant departments in Hunan Province are combining current production and organizing forces to conduct key investigations and research in various types of townships and agricultural cooperatives. Judging from investigations in various places, the grain situation in rural Hunan is stable.

    Current Basic Grain Situation in Rural Areas

Last year, Hunan Province suffered a drought that was rare in a century, but the total grain output still reached 20.61 billion catties (higher than any year before liberation, roughly equal to the output of the bumper years of 1952 and 1953 after liberation). At the same time, the state purchased 950 million catties less grain last year than in 1955, and sold 690 million catties more. Thus, the state actually left relatively 1.64 billion catties more grain for farmers. Therefore, although there was a reduction in output last year, the amount of grain retained in rural areas, except for a slight decrease in disaster areas, was roughly the same as in 1955 in other areas, and generally maintained or exceeded the "Three Fixes" (fixed output, fixed purchase, fixed sales) grain retention standard. According to a survey conducted by the Xiangtan Special District Grain Department in four typical townships that suffered disaster and reduced production, the average per capita grain retention in 1956 decreased by 10.8% compared to 1955, but still exceeded the Three Fixes grain retention level by 6%.

Last year's grain unified purchase and sales work in Hunan Province was carried out on the basis of the "Three Fixes" for grain and cooperation. The grain output was generally checked more clearly, and generally "unified purchase of surplus grain and unified sales of rations" was achieved, with more attention paid to disaster-stricken areas due to drought. According to investigations by the Hunan Province Production and Disaster Relief Office working group in Shuangqiao Cooperative in Zengjia Township, Shuangfeng County, Wangyang Cooperative in Huangshi Township, Hengnan County, and Tongxin Cooperative in Jiumu Township, Changsha County, Shuangqiao Cooperative's rice output decreased by 40% last year, sweet potato output decreased by more than 80%, and autumn buckwheat basically had no harvest, making it a severely drought-stricken cooperative; Wangyang Cooperative's rice output decreased by 35% last year, and autumn miscellaneous grain output decreased by 86%, but because of the large amount of land, it was still a unified purchase cooperative; Tongxin Cooperative basically had no disasters last year, and the main miscellaneous grain output decreased by only 3.2%, with a slight increase in rice output, making it a surplus grain cooperative. However, after the grain unified purchase and sales work, Shuangqiao Cooperative's average per capita distribution plus unified sales grain totaled 432 catties of main miscellaneous grain, Wangyang Cooperative's average per capita grain retention was 506 catties, and Tongxin Cooperative's average per capita distribution of main miscellaneous grain was at least 480 catties and at most 580 catties, with more than 90% of cooperative members exceeding the 500 catties grain retention standard. Whether from the perspective of grain retention or supply standards, these three cooperatives all met the indicators for sufficient food.

Of course, doing a good job in unified purchase and sales does not mean that there are absolutely no problems. After the early rice harvest last year, the fight against drought was tense, the consumption of staple food was excessive, and the autumn and winter miscellaneous grains were severely reduced in output. Individual places still had biases in the specific work of unified purchase and sales, such as overestimating output, purchasing too much, selling too little, or leaking sales; the inconsistency in the method of calculating the population in the autumn harvest distribution and grain unified sales within the agricultural cooperative, coupled with the fact that some farmers did not plan their grain consumption, resulted in some farmers in various places still having insufficient rations, and the degree of their grain shortage varied. This is the problem that urgently needs to be solved.

  Mutual Exchange Can Adjust Surplus and Deficiency

According to the latest investigation and survey materials from various places in Hunan, the grain retention in the hands of farmers is very uneven. According to a survey by the Chen County Grain Bureau in three types of cooperatives (bumper harvest, protected production, reduced production): the lowest grain retention number of some bumper harvest cooperatives is even 20 to 30 catties higher than the highest grain retention number of disaster-stricken cooperatives. Yuncongdong Agricultural Cooperative in Liangshui Township, Yuanling, has 24% of households short of 10,530 catties of grain, but another 16% of households have a surplus of 10,920 catties of grain, leaving a surplus after offsetting the deficiency. In various agricultural cooperatives, cooperative members with strong labor and more work points generally receive more grain than other cooperative members. Some cooperative members who were wealthy middle peasants in the past have seen a reduction in the grain they possess compared to before joining the cooperative, but compared to other cooperative members, they still retain more grain. Experience has proven that in these places, educating farmers, organizing them to directly adjust, or using the state grain market to exchange what they have and don't have can solve some of the difficulties for grain-short farmers. At the same time, now in various agricultural cooperatives, in addition to retaining a portion of the cooperative members' revolving grain, there are still a lot of accumulated public welfare funds and public accumulation funds grain. Some also have grain that should be revolved but has not been issued revolving certificates. According to statistics from eight townships in Xiangyin County: agricultural cooperatives retain more than 169,000 catties of public welfare funds and public accumulation funds grain, and more than 60,000 catties of grain that should be revolved but have not been issued revolving certificates. These grains should be allocated to grain-short farmers.

Investigation materials from various places also show that some places with more serious grain problems are not necessarily places where the disaster is severe, and some townships that have not suffered disasters have also been found to have grain shortages. For example, Chen County's Changlong Agricultural Cooperative reduced production by 37.6% last year. Because the unified sales and distribution work was done well, only 10% of households are short of grain, while one cooperative in Heping Township, Yongxing County, increased production last year, but because the households with strong labor and large food consumption were not given necessary consideration in the distribution, some households had increased population, and some wasted grain, so the grain-short households accounted for more than 33% of the total number of households, which is even more serious than in the disaster area.

Of course, in addition to some factors of improper work, the phenomenon of farmers not using grain according to plan and wasting grain is also quite alarming. In many bumper harvest areas, farmers are improving their lives too quickly and too much, and some farmers in disaster areas are still consuming grain at the same level as in normal or even bumper years. At present, Hunan Province is conducting in-depth ideological education work for farmers, earnestly helping farmers to formulate plans for saving grain, and persuading some farmers to correct their ideas of demanding too high a level of grain consumption and simply relying on the state; at the same time, they are also mobilizing farmers to plant more early-maturing crops and do a good job in planting and cultivating spring and summer harvest crops. Various places are also conducting a truthful grain supplementary sales work to earnestly solve the difficulties of grain-short farmers. These efforts have created favorable conditions for striving for a great agricultural harvest this year.

　　湖南农村无春荒
　　部分农民缺粮在社内调剂可以解决
　　黄驭白
    每年在春节、春耕前后和麦收以前，农村的粮食问题常常出现一些比较紧张的现象。过去，人们把插秧以前的这段紧张时期叫做春荒期，从插秧以后到接新叫做夏荒期。湖南省有关部门为了正确掌握当前农村粮食情况，正在结合当前生产，组织力量到各种类型的乡和农业社进行重点调查和研究。从各地调查来看，湖南农村粮食情况是稳定的。
    目前农村粮食基本情况
    去年，湖南省遭受了百年少有的旱灾，但是粮食总产量仍然达到了二百零六亿一千万斤（高出解放前的任何一年，与解放后丰收的1952年和1953年产量大体相等），同时去年国家比1955年少征购了九亿五千万斤而又多销了六亿九千万斤粮食。这样，国家实际上给农民相对地多留了十六亿四千万斤粮食。因此，去年虽然减产，但农村留粮数量，除了灾区略有减少以外，在其他地区大体上与1955年是相接近的，而且一般都保持或超过了“三定”的留粮标准。据湘潭专区粮食部门在四个受灾减产的典型乡调查，1956年每人留粮比1955年虽然减少了10.8％，但仍然超过三定留粮水平的6％。
    去年湖南省的粮食统购统销工作，是在粮食“三定”和合作化的基础上进行的。粮食产量一般查的较清，一般地都做到了“统购余粮、统销口粮”，对于因旱成灾地区注意了更多地照顾。据湖南省生产救灾办公室工作组在双峰县增加乡双桥社、衡南县黄狮乡王养社和长沙县九木乡同心社的调查，其中双桥社去年稻谷减产40％，红薯减产80％以上，秋荞基本无收，是受旱严重的社；王养社去年稻谷减产35％，秋杂粮减产86％，因田亩较多，仍是统购社；同心社去年基本无灾，主杂粮仅减产3.2％，其中稻谷还略有增产，是余粮社。但经过粮食统购统销工作以后，双桥社每人平均分配再加上统销粮共有主杂粮四百三十二斤，王养社每人平均留粮五百零六斤，同心社每人平均分到主杂粮最低的是四百八十斤，最高的有五百八十斤，其中90％以上社员超过留粮五百斤的标准。无论从留粮和供应的标准来看，这三个社都达到够吃的指标。
    自然，统购统销工作做的好，不等于就完全没有问题。去年早稻收获后，抗旱紧张，主粮消耗过多，秋冬杂粮严重减产，个别地方在统购统销的具体工作上仍然发生估产过高，多购、少销或漏销的偏向；农业社内秋收分配和粮食统销中人口计算方法的不一致，加上有的农民没有计划用粮，因此，各地仍然有一部分农民的口粮不足，他们缺粮的程度不等。这是目前亟需要解决的问题。
  互通有无即可调剂余缺
    从湖南各地最近调查摸底的材料来看，现在农民手中留粮是很不平衡的。据郴县粮食局在三种类型（丰产、保产、减产）社的调查：丰产社的最低留粮数有的比受灾社的最高留粮数还高出二十斤至三十斤。沅陵凉水井乡云从洞农业社有24％的户缺粮一万零五百三十斤，但另外有16％的户还有余粮一万零九百二十斤，余缺相抵还有多余。各地农业社内劳力强，出工多的社员，一般都要比其他社员多分些粮食。有些过去是富裕中农的社员，他们现在所占有的粮食较未入社前有所减少，但同其他社员比较，他们保有的粮食还是较多的。经验证明，在这些地方教育农民，组织他们直接调剂，或通过国家粮食市场互通有无，就可以解决缺粮农民的一定困难。同时，现在各地农业社内，除了留下一部分社员的周转粮外，还积存不少的公益金和公积金粮食。有的还有应周转而未发周转证的粮食。据湘阴县八个乡的统计：农业社内留有公益金及公积金粮食十六万九千多斤，应周转未发周转证的粮食六万多斤。这些粮食应该调剂给缺粮农民。
    各地调查材料还说明，某些粮食问题较严重的地方，并不一定都是灾情严重的地方，一些未受灾的乡也发现有缺粮的情况。例如郴县长隆农业社去年减产37.6％。因为统销和分配工作做得好，只有10％的户缺粮，而永兴县和平乡一社去年是增产的社，因为对劳力强食量大的户，在分配时未加以必要的照顾，有的户人口增加，有的用粮浪费，所以缺粮户达总户数的33％以上，比灾区问题还严重。
    当然，缺粮的原因，除了工作不当的一些因素外，农民不按计划用粮和浪费粮食的现象也是相当惊人的。有不少丰收地区，农民过急过高地改善生活，有些灾区农民仍然按照常年甚至丰年一样的消费粮食。目前，湖南省各地正在对农民深入地进行思想教育工作，切实帮助农民订好节约用粮计划，说服某些农民改正对用粮水平要求过高和单纯依赖国家的思想；同时还发动农民多种早熟作物，做好春夏收作物的种植培育工作。各地还正在实事求是地进行一次粮食补销工作，认真解决缺粮农民的困难。这些工作对争取今年的农业大丰收创造了有利的条件。
