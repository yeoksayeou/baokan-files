Xinhua News Agency, March 27th, Bangkok dispatch: The Thai Labor Federation and its affiliated twenty-seven trade unions held their founding ceremony in Bangkok on the 20th. Nai Suphachai Srisati, the deputy leader of the Labor Party, addressed the more than 10,000 workers present. He said that all of our workers wish to see our motherland pursue an independent and autonomous policy, uphold the principle of peaceful coexistence with all countries, and establish normal trade relations with all countries; at the same time, we are absolutely unwilling to cooperate with any country that interferes in the internal affairs of other countries. Only in this way can Thailand move towards a path of peace and happiness.

The Prime Minister of Thailand and leader of the Manangkasila Liberal Party, Luang Phibunsongkhram, who was invited to preside over the opening ceremony, commented on the demands made by Nai Suphachai in his speech, saying: "I cannot immediately agree to implement the demands you have made, but I promise to take them for study. Whether it is implementing a free and independent policy, withdrawing from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, or abolishing anti-communist regulations, I am happy to consider implementing them."

Xinhua News Agency, March 28th, Bangkok dispatch: Nai Chuan Ratanawarahaha, the Secretary-General of the Hyde Park Movement Party of Thailand, delivered a speech on behalf of the Socialist United Front at a campaign rally held in Bangkok on the 23rd, advocating adherence to an independent and autonomous foreign policy that establishes friendly relations with all countries. Nai Suthep Kangchachun, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, a member of the Socialist United Front, also said at the same rally that if the current government does not revise its foreign policy of following the West, Thailand's social and economic problems cannot be solved.

Lawyer Nai Sambor Bunnaprasit, who was imprisoned for three years for so-called "peaceful rebellion," delivered a campaign speech at a mass rally of nearly 10,000 people in Thonburi Province on the 24th, demanding that the Thai government break free from the shackles of imperialism and pursue an independent policy. He said that due to its participation in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, Thailand has become a market for American arms, its economy has declined, and the people are living in poverty.

    泰国政界要求奉行独立政策
    同世界各国和平共处  退出东南亚军事集团
    据新华社27日讯  曼谷消息：泰国劳工联合会及其所属的二十七个不同行业的工会20日在曼谷举行成立仪式。工党副领袖乃素帕猜·是塞滴代表到会的一万多名工人发表演讲。他说，我们全体工人愿意见到自己的祖国执行独立自主的政策，维护同世界各国和平共处的原则，同各国建立正常贸易关系；同时，决不愿意和任何干涉别国内政的国家合作。只有这样，泰国才能走向和平幸福的道路。
    应邀主持这次揭幕典礼的泰国总理、马兰卡西拉自由党领袖銮披汶在演讲中就乃素帕猜提出的要求发表意见说：“现在我不能马上答应执行你们所提出的要求，但我答应拿去研究，不论是执行自由独立政策或退出东南亚条约组织及取消防共条例，我是乐意考虑执行的。
    据新华社28日讯  曼谷消息：泰国海德公园运动党总书记乃川。鲁达纳瓦拉哈代表社会主义联合阵线23日在曼谷举行的竞选集会上发表演说，主张坚持实行独立自主，和一切国家建立友好关系的外交政策。社会主义联合阵线的成员之一社会民主党领袖乃素贴·钢乍军也在同一集会上说，如果现政府不修改它的追随西方的外交政策，那么泰国的社会和经济的种种难题是无法解决的。
    曾因所谓“和平谋叛”而被监禁过三年的律师乃三博·奔巴立24日在吞武里府的一个近万人参加的群众集会上发表竞选演说，要求泰国政府摆脱帝国主义的枷锁，执行独立政策。他说，由于参加东南亚条约组织，泰国已沦为美国的军火市场，经济衰退，民不聊生。
