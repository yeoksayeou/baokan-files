　　Emphasizing Children's Dance Activities
　　Yin Pei
　　A few years ago, a friend who had been to Poland told me that almost all Polish children could dance their own folk dances. This sentence left a deep impression on me.

　　Not long ago, I attended a Young Pioneer get-together where they performed two dances: the "Ukrainian Circle Dance" and the "Money Drum Dance." In the "Ukrainian Circle Dance," they not only accurately performed the dance movements and formation changes, but also grasped a certain dance style and inner emotion. However, their performance of the "Money Drum Dance" was not appealing; two performers danced on stage with little variation, making a few movements and then ending. It is understood that the former was guided by professional workers, while the latter was choreographed by the students themselves. This made me think about some issues regarding children's dance activities over the past few years: professional dance workers rarely care about children's dance activities; performances by professional song and dance troupes also rarely feature dances reflecting children's lives. In the national professional troupe music and dance performance, only the "Pulling Radishes" from the Beijing Dance School and "Ten Minutes After Class" from the Sichuan delegation appeared. Professional dance workers have also done very little to guide children's dance activities. Children want to learn to dance but have no one to teach them, and they can't buy any dance materials in bookstores (the "Clapping Dance" created by the students of Beijing No. 8 Girls' Middle School, published by the Juvenile and Children's Publishing House, sold 66,000 copies in just over a year, showing how great the demand for such materials is). It is of course difficult for children to engage in activities without guidance, and even if they are guided, they learn some foreign dances, resulting in the abnormal situation where many children can dance foreign dances but not Chinese dances.

　　Dance art plays a significant role in cultivating children's aesthetic sense, making their emotions and personalities cheerful and lively, and in the physical and mental development. It is a pity that we have not paid enough attention to this activity.

　　In this folk music and dance performance, I saw several excellent children's dance programs, which was truly exciting. For example, the "Luozi Dance" from Jiangsu and the "Flower Cymbal Drum" from Beijing are both very vigorous and flexible. The somersaults and jumps of the "Luozi Dance" and the flying of the flower cymbals up, down, left, and right in the "Flower Cymbal Drum" can all express the heroic, forthright, and optimistic characteristics of the Chinese people. In Sichuan's "Jumping Cloud Child," children dance holding cloud balls, with clear rhythm and joyful emotions. In Jiangsu's "Cloud Plaque Dance," children hold cloud plaques in both hands, expressing various changes of clouds through different formation patterns. Anhui's "Wedding Dance" depicts a group of girls imitating the "wedding" ceremony, which is very lifelike and makes people feel very intimate. From these dances, it can be seen that there are many dances suitable for children to dance in the treasure trove of Chinese folk dance art. Just the few dances mentioned above, with some necessary processing, can become very good children's dances. The key question is whether we value this work and whether someone is willing to spend some energy and labor for the children.

### 重视儿童舞蹈活动

　　重视儿童舞蹈活动
　　荫培
    前几年，一个到过波兰的朋友告诉我：波兰的儿童们差不多都会跳自己的民间舞。这一句话给我的印象很深。
    不久以前，我参加一个少先队员的联欢会，他们表演了两个舞蹈：“乌克兰圆舞”和“钱鼓舞”。在“乌克兰圆舞”中，他们不但能准确地做出舞蹈动作和队形的变化，而且还掌握了一定的舞蹈风格和内在的感情。但是，他们跳的“钱鼓舞”却不吸引人；两个演员很少变化地在台上跳了几下，做出几个动作就结束了。据了解，前者是专业工作者辅导的，后者是同学们自己编的。这也就使我想到几年来儿童舞蹈活动的一些问题：专业舞蹈工作者很少关心儿童的舞蹈活动；从专业歌舞团的演出中也很少看到反映儿童生活的舞蹈。在全国专业团体音乐舞蹈会演中仅仅出现了北京舞蹈学校的“拔萝卜”和四川代表团的“下课十分钟”这两个节目。专业舞蹈工作者对儿童舞蹈活动的辅导工作也做得非常少，小朋友们想学舞蹈没有人给教，到书店里又买不到什么舞蹈材料（少年儿童出版社出版的北京女八中同学们创作的“拍手舞”在一年多的时间就销行了六万几千册，可见这类材料的需要量是多大）。孩子们在没有人指导的情况下，要活动当然是困难的，就是受到辅导的，学的也是一些外国舞蹈，因此出现了很多孩子会跳外国舞不会跳中国舞的不正常情况。
    舞蹈艺术在培养儿童的美感，使他们的情感和性格开朗、活泼，在身心发育的健美等方面都有着很大的作用。可惜我们没有重视这种活动。
    在这次民间音乐舞蹈会演中，我看到了好几个优秀的儿童舞蹈节目，真是令人兴奋。如江苏的“洛子舞”、北京的“花钹大鼓”都非常健美、灵活。“洛子舞”的翻滚跳跃，“花钹大鼓”中，花钹上下左右的飞舞都能表现出我国人民英勇、豪爽、乐观的性格特点。四川的“跳云童”，儿童手执云球舞蹈，节奏清晰、情绪愉快。江苏的“云牌舞”，儿童们双手拿着云牌，通过不同的队形图案表现出云的各种变化。安徽的“迎亲舞”描写一群女孩子模仿着“迎亲”的仪式，很有生活气息，使人感到非常亲切。从这些舞蹈中，可以看出我国民间舞蹈艺术的宝藏里有着很多适合儿童跳的舞蹈，仅上面所谈的几个舞蹈，只要进行一些必要的加工，就能成为很好的儿童舞蹈，问题的关键就在于是否重视这一项工作，是否有人愿意为孩子们花费一些精力和劳动。
