Xinhua News Agency, March 8th—In the handicraft cooperative movement's high tide last year, a number of handicraft cooperatives that blindly implemented centralized production and unified profit and loss accounting have now been adjusted and reorganized in various provinces and cities. Among the 296 cooperatives adjusted and reorganized in 21 counties (cities) including Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Andong, and Fengcheng, 106 large and comprehensive cooperatives were divided into 273 small cooperatives and production groups. Sixty-five cooperatives reduced the size of their accounting units, and the remaining cooperatives appropriately increased service points according to the needs of residents. Some cooperatives that produced unique products, or whose elderly, frail, or family auxiliary labor force were difficult to arrange for, were changed to decentralized production with independent accounting. These adjusted and reorganized cooperatives in these cities and counties accounted for 20% to 40% of the original number of cooperatives.

After adjustment and reorganization, the cooperatives generally overcame the shortcomings caused by the unconsidered implementation of centralized production and unified profit and loss accounting, restoring the original production and management characteristics of handicrafts. For example, the Neijiang County Daily-Use Metal Production Cooperative in Sichuan Province previously did not repair old items. After being divided into smaller cooperatives, it resumed the business of repairing old items, and the surrounding masses said, "This is the right way to do it." The Zhangzhou City No. 1 Sewing Cooperative in Fujian Province added service points during the adjustment and reorganization and implemented separate accounting of profits and losses. Each person can now do more work each day than before, and the delivery time has been shortened from one month to fifteen to twenty days. The Shangyu County Baiguan Machine Repair Cooperative in Zhejiang Province originally included handicraftsmen from nine industries and implemented unified accounting of profits and losses, which resulted in shortcomings such as too many people and too little work, and chaotic management. After changing to separate accounting according to natural industries, the cadres who were not directly involved in production were put into production, and administrative expenses were reduced from 160 yuan per month to 19 yuan, and the average income of the members increased by 65%. Many famous products have also resumed production after the handicraft cooperatives adjusted their organizational forms.

According to a survey of 766 cooperatives in 10 counties (cities) in the four provinces of Liaoning, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Fujian, another 20% to 30% of the cooperatives need to continue to adjust their organizational forms and accounting methods. Among these cooperatives, some are comprehensive cooperatives with multiple industries, some are large cooperatives with excessively large scales and widely distributed areas, and some are repair and service cooperatives that have abolished too many service points and are overly centralized. According to the reporter, the Central Handicraft Administration has, in light of this situation, listed the continued adjustment of the organizational forms and accounting methods of handicraft cooperatives as one of the central tasks for the transformation of handicrafts this year.

### 恢复原有的生产经营特点  各地着手调整手工业合作社

    恢复原有的生产经营特点
    各地着手调整手工业合作社
    新华社8日讯　在去年合作化高潮中盲目实行集中生产和统一计算盈亏的手工业合作社，各省市现在都有一批进行了调整改组。天津、石家庄、安东、凤城等二十一个县
  （市）调整改组的二百九十六个社中，有一百零六个大社和综合社划为二百七十三个小社和生产小组，有六十五个社把核算单位划小，其余的社有的根据居民需要，适当地增设了服务点；有的将生产独特产品和年老体弱、家庭辅助劳动力难以安排的社员户，改变为分散生产，自负盈亏。这些市县调整改组的社占原有社数的20％到40％不等。
    经过调整改组的合作社，一般都克服了因为不顾条件地实行集中生产和统一计算盈亏所引起的缺点，恢复了手工业原有的生产经营特点。如四川省内江县日用金属生产合作社过去不修理旧活，在分成为小社以后就恢复了修理旧活的业务，附近群众都说“这样做才对头”。福建省漳州市第一缝纫社在调整改组中增设了服务点，并且实行分别计算盈亏，每人每天能比以前多做一些活，交货时间由一个月缩短为十五天到二十天。浙江省上虞县百官机器修理合作社原来包括九个行业的手工业者，实行了统一计算盈亏，结果引起了人多活少、管理混乱等等缺点，在改为按自然行业分别核算后，脱产干部投入了生产，行政费用由每月一百六十元减少到十九元，社员平均收入增加65％。还有许多著名的产品在手工业社调整组织形式以后恢复了生产。
    据辽宁、陕西、四川、福建四省十个县（市）七百六十六个社调查，还有20％到30％的社需要继续调整组织形式和核算方式。这些社中，有的是多行业的综合社，有的是规模过大、分布地区过广的大社，还有一些是撤消服务点过多、集中过大的修理服务性合作社。据记者了解，中央手工业管理局已经根据这种情况，把继续调整手工业合作社的组织形式和核算方式列为今年对手工业改造的中心工作之一。
