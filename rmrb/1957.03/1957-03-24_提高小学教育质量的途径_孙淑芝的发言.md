I am honored and happy to participate in the enlarged meeting of the Supreme State Conference and to hear Chairman Mao's cordial speech, which has deeply educated me. I will certainly follow Chairman Mao's teachings in my work.

I fully support Premier Zhou Enlai's and Vice Premier Li Fuchun's reports.

Looking back, 1956 was such a historically significant and inspiring year! In this year, the great historical task of socialist transformation was victoriously completed nationwide, socialist construction developed vigorously, and people's living standards improved. Of course, under such rapid development, it is inevitable that some shortcomings and problems will arise in the work. We believe that under the leadership of the Party, through the convening of this conference, not only will the existing shortcomings and problems be overcome and solved one by one, but also the work in 1957 will achieve greater results.

In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, general education has also developed greatly along with the development of national construction undertakings. Taking the development of general education in Harbin as an example: at present, there are 135 primary schools in the city, with 145,410 primary school students, which is 2.3 times that of 1949 and 7.2 times that before liberation. In 1956, the number of new students enrolled reached 97.4% of the number of applicants, and children who applied in the city were basically admitted; there are currently 33 general middle schools and normal schools (including 2 normal schools), with 44,298 students, which is 6.9 times that of 1949 and 11.4 times that before liberation. In addition, there are two schools for the blind, deaf, and mute, with 335 students. The above facts show the importance that our Party and the state attach to primary and secondary education and the continuous improvement of people's cultural and material life.

Judging from the quality of primary education, due to a series of reforms since the founding of the country, such as the reform of the teaching system, the compilation of teaching outlines, the reform of teaching content, and the improvement of teaching methods, the quality of education has also been continuously improving, but it is still not very consistent with the development of the number of schools. I believe that further improving the quality of school education is the main task of primary education workers in 1957. The following are just a few immature suggestions on improving the quality of education:

  **Improve the political and cultural level of primary school teachers**
	
    The main reason for the low quality of primary education at present is the low level of teachers. In recent years, the Party and the state have done a lot of work to improve the quality of teachers, but due to the limitations of historical conditions, the level of teachers in the past was low and the source of teachers was insufficient. With the rapid development of schools, a large number of new teachers have joined the teaching staff. Therefore, the current level of teachers is still not satisfactory. For example, in Harbin, due to years of being occupied and cultural backwardness in the past, although the Party and the state have taken various measures to improve the quality of teachers, currently only 13.7% of all teachers have a level equivalent to or above that of a normal school graduate, 19.5% have the level of a normal school student, 51.5% have the level of a junior normal school graduate, and 15% are below the level of a junior normal school graduate. Therefore, planned and systematic improvement of teacher level should still be regarded as the central link in improving the quality of education.

    Various regions have already made proper arrangements to improve the cultural level of teachers through teachers' spare-time further education schools and correspondence courses. It is hoped that the study subjects will not be stipulated as compulsory subjects, and a departmental study system will be adopted so that teachers can choose subjects according to their work needs and various conditions, which is more practical. It is hoped that the leadership of teachers' political and professional theoretical study will be strengthened, and more care will be given to teachers' political life. For example, teachers should be given more opportunities to listen to current affairs reports and other relevant reports so that teachers can continuously improve their political and professional theoretical level through learning. In particular, having correct views and positions on the complex changes in the domestic and international situation is of great significance for clarifying teachers' thinking, correcting teachers' understanding, guiding teachers' work, and setting an example to influence and educate students.

    While improving the level of teachers, it is particularly important to improve the political, professional, and cultural level of school leading cadres. Because the level of leading cadres plays a decisive role in improving the quality of school education.

    In order to improve the quality of teachers' learning and ensure the effectiveness of teachers' learning, the key lies in ensuring teachers' self-study time. In recent years, the phenomenon of focusing on work and neglecting learning has been relatively common due to the heavy workload of teachers. It is hoped that the education administrative department will have an in-depth understanding of the teachers' work situation and deal with it appropriately within the possible scope.

    **Education administrative departments should help teachers**
    **Summarize and promote teaching experience**

    In recent years, a large number of new teachers have been added, and the original teachers are still exploring how to implement the new teaching outline and use the new teaching materials. It is very necessary for the education administrative department to strengthen the leadership of the school and help teachers summarize and promote experience. It is hoped that education administrative leaders can often go deep into the school to check and understand, give specific help to the school and teachers, discover experience, and help teachers summarize. This can not only improve the teachers' enthusiasm for work, but also encourage the teachers to actively summarize experience. Teachers themselves should realize that summarizing and promoting experience can not only enrich others, but also is a process of checking and improving their own work. Only by summarizing the bits and pieces of experience can it gradually become complete experience. We must overcome the problem of being ambitious but incompetent, and attach importance to the work of summarizing and promoting experience.

    **All parties are jointly responsible for educating children**

    In the past year, due to the rapid development of primary education and the limitations of national financial and material resources, the two-shift teaching rate has increased rapidly. Now it has reached 88.9% in primary schools in Harbin and 23.2% in suburban primary schools. In this way, the time that most primary school students spend at school is relatively reduced. In addition, the school's ideological and political education for students is weak, and the organization of students' after-school education has not been able to keep up. As a result, many students are impolite and undisciplined both inside and outside the school, and some students even steal. In order to change this phenomenon, on the one hand, the school should consolidate and promote the educational thought of teachers' comprehensive responsibility, strengthen ideological and political education for students, vigorously carry out extracurricular and school activities, and closely connect the school with the family; on the other hand, the school, the family, and all relevant aspects of the society must be combined to jointly shoulder the responsibility of educating children. At present, the arrangement of after-school activities for primary school students in Harbin is based on family learning groups as the basic organizational form. The content of group activities mainly includes doing homework and cooperating with various types of activities, such as: singing, games, reading books, listening to the radio, participating in public welfare activities, etc. In addition, in addition to the extracurricular cultural and sports activities and various subject group activities stipulated by the school every week, after-school children's education institutions also assist the school in carrying out after-school activities for two-shift students. For example, the Children's Palace has organized 21 groups such as glider, dance, and music, which have absorbed many students to participate in, and often holds various ball games, and has cultivated many young skaters in skating; the Children's Railway has trained many railway employees since its opening; each district has children's reading rooms and small libraries; railway cultural halls and workers' clubs have children's reading rooms attached to them. In addition, children's parks, children's stadiums, and children's cinemas are all places for children to carry out activities. At present, some schools have explored some experience in organizing family learning groups, but most schools and classes are unable to get children to settle into group learning and cannot often participate in various activities of after-school education institutions due to the lack of cooperation from students' parents and the small number of after-school children's education institutions and their low utilization rate. In order to properly arrange the spare-time activities of two-shift students, it is hoped that students' parents, education administrative departments, and relevant parties such as trade unions, the Communist Youth League, women's federations, and neighborhood committees will care more about children, assist schools in researching proper methods, and vigorously support schools in overcoming the shortcomings brought about by the two-shift system, so that our younger generation can grow up smoothly.

Under the leadership of the Party, the vast majority of primary school teachers are devoted to primary education, work hard and simply, and bury themselves in hard work. In 1956, when everyone saw in the newspaper that the index for raising the wages of primary school teachers was as high as 32.8%, higher than universities, middle schools, and many other departments, we deeply felt that this was the Party and the state's concern for primary school teachers; it was a concrete measure for the Party and the state to enable primary school teachers to quickly obtain improvement on the basis of their low wages in the past. After the wage assessment, although the wages of primary school teachers are still relatively low, and there are still unreasonable phenomena between them and certain departments, the vast majority of teachers are aware that wages were too low in the past, the teaching staff is large, and it is difficult for the Party and the state to raise the wages of primary school teachers at one time while taking into account the universal improvement of the living standards of all employees. We unanimously believe that under the leadership of the Party, the wages and benefits of primary school teachers will definitely gradually increase with the development of the national economy. Therefore, the enthusiasm and initiative of the vast majority of teachers are higher than before. This is manifested in politics in the demand for progress and improvement of ideological level; in work, to do a good job in business, improve teaching, and actively participate in various studies, and strive to improve work ability, and are willing to contribute more to the country in cultivating the socialist younger generation.

    提高小学教育质量的途径
    孙淑芝的发言
    我光荣、幸福地参加了最高国务会议的扩大会议，听到了毛主席的亲切讲话，使我受到极深刻的教育，我一定遵循毛主席的教导去进行我的工作。
    我对周恩来总理和李富春副总理的报告完全拥护。
    回顾1956年是多么具有历史意义而又是多么振奋人心的一年！这一年里，在全国范围内，胜利地完成了社会主义改造的伟大历史任务，社会主义建设事业有了蓬勃发展，人民生活水平有了提高。当然，在这样迅速发展前进的情况下，工作中产生某些缺点和问题是不可避免的。我们相信在党的领导下，通过这次大会的召开，不仅能够克服和逐一解决目前存在的缺点和问题，并将使1957年的工作，获得更大的成绩。
    几年来普通教育在党的领导下，随着国家各项建设事业的发展也有了很大的发展。从哈尔滨市普通教育的发展情况来看：现在全市有小学135所，小学生145，410人，是1949年的2.3倍，是解放前的7.2倍。1956年新生入学人数已达到报名人数的97.4％，市内报名的儿童基本上被录取了；现有普通中学、师范共33所（内师范2所），学生44，298人，是1949年的6.9倍，是解放前的11.4倍。此外还有盲聋哑学校二所，学生335人。上述事实说明了我们的党和国家对于中、小学教育的重视和人民文化物质生活的不断提高。
    从小学教育的质量来看，由于建国以来进行了教学制度的改革，编订教学大纲、改革教学内容以及改进教学方法等一系列的改革工作，教育质量也在不断地提高，但与学校数量发展的情况对比起来，还是不很相称的。我认为进一步提高学校的教育质量乃是小学教育工作者在1957年的主要任务。下面仅就提高教育质量方面提供几点不成熟的建议：
  提高小学教师的政治文化水平
    目前小学教育质量不高的主要原因是师资水平不高。几年来，党和国家在提高师资方面做了许多工作，但由于历史条件的限制，过去师资水平低，师资来源不足，在学校迅速发展的情况下，大批新教师加入了教师队伍，因此目前的师资水平仍不能令人满意。例如哈尔滨市，由于过去沦陷多年，文化落后，党和国家虽然采取了各种提高师资的办法，而目前具有中师和中师以上水平的，仅占全体教师的13.7％，中师肄业水平仍占19.5％，初师毕业水平的占51.5％，不足初师毕业水平的占15％。因此有计划的、有系统的提高师资水平仍应作为提高教育质量的中心环节。
    对于提高教师的文化水平，各地通过教师业余进修学校及函授等办法，早已做了妥善安排。希望在学习科目上不做必修科的规定，采取分科学习制，使教师根据自己工作的需要和各方面的条件，自行选科，比较更实际些。对教师的政治、业务理论学习，希望加强领导，更多的关怀教师的政治生活。例如多给予教师听取时事报告和其他有关报告的机会，使教师通过学习，不断地提高政治、业务理论水平。特别是对复杂的国内外形势的变化，能具有正确的观点、立场，这对于澄清教师的思想、端正教师的认识、指导教师的工作以及以身作则的影响教育学生，都具有极大作用的。
    在提高教师水平的同时，提高学校领导干部的政治、业务和文化水平尤为重要。因为领导干部水平的高低，对于提高学校教育质量是起着决定作用的。
    为了提高教师的学习质量，保证教师的学习效果，其关键在于保证教师的自修时间，几年来由于教师的工作负担较重，抓工作而放松学习的现象是比较普遍的，希望教育行政部门，深入了解一下教师的工作情况，在可能范围内予以适当处理。
    教育行政部门要帮助教师
      总结和推广教学经验
    几年来，增添了大批新教师，原有教师对于如何执行新教学大纲、使用新教材又正在摸索的时候，教育行政部门加强对学校的领导，帮助教师总结、推广经验是非常必要的。希望教育行政领导能经常深入学校检查了解，给予学校和教师以具体帮助，发现经验，帮助教师总结，这不仅能提高教师工作热情，也鼓舞了教师总结经验的积极性。教师本身应该认识到总结、推广经验，既能丰富别人，又是检查和提高自己工作的过程。只有把一点一滴的经验总结出来，才能逐渐成为完整的经验。要克服眼高手低的毛病，重视总结、推广经验的工作。
    各方面共同负责教育儿童
    一年来由于小学教育的迅速发展和国家财力物力的限制，二部授课率迅速增加，现在哈尔滨市内小学已达88.9％，郊区小学已达23.2％。这样，大部分小学生在校的时间就相对的减少，再加上学校对学生的思想政治教育薄弱，对学生校外教育组织又没能迎头赶上去，因而目前很多学生在校内外不礼貌，不守纪律，个别学生还有偷窃行为。为了转变这种现象，一方面在学校里要巩固、发扬教师全面负责的教育思想，加强对学生的思想政治教育，大力开展课、校外活动，密切学校与家庭的联系；另方面学校和家庭以及社会各有关方面，必须结合起来，共同担负起教育儿童的责任。现在哈市对小学生校外活动的安排，是以家庭学习小组为基本组织形式，小组活动内容，主要是作作业，配合各类型的活动，如：唱歌、游戏、看图书、听广播、参加公益活动等。此外，除学校每周规定的课余文体活动和各科小组活动之外，校外儿童教育机关也协助学校开展二部制学生的校外活动。例如少年宫组织了滑翔机、舞蹈、音乐等21个小组，吸收了许多学生参加，经常举行各种球类比赛，在滑冰运动中培养出许多小滑冰手；儿童铁路自通行以来，培养了不少铁路员工；各区有儿童阅览室和小型图书馆；铁路文化馆和工人俱乐部附设儿童阅览室。此外儿童公园、儿童体育场、儿童影院等场所，都是儿童开展活动的地方。目前在组织家庭学习小组方面，有些学校摸索出一些经验，但大部分学校和班级，由于学生家长缺乏通力合作，校外儿童教育机关不多，利用率不大，致使学生不安于小组学习，不能常常参加校外教育机关的各项活动。为了适当的安排二部制学生的业余活动，希望学生家长、教育行政部门以及工会、青年团、妇联、居民委员会等有关方面，更多的关怀儿童，协助学校研究出妥善的办法，大力支持学校克服二部制带来的缺点，使我们的青少年一代顺利的成长。
    在党的领导下，绝大多数的小学教师，安心于小学教育事业，艰苦朴素，埋头苦干。当1956年，大家在报纸上看到了小学教师提高工资的指标竟达32.8％之多，高于大学、中学以及其他许多部门的时候，我们深深感到：这是党和国家对小学教师的关怀；是党和国家要使小学教师在过去工资低的基础上，尽快的获得提高的具体措施。评定工资之后，虽然小学教师的工资还是比较低的，而且和某些部门之间还存在着不合理的现象，而绝大多数教师鉴于过去工资太低，教师队伍又大，党和国家在顾及到全体职工生活普遍提高一步的情况下，使小学教师的工资一次就提上去，是有困难的。我们一致认为在党的领导下，小学教师的工资待遇绝对会随着国家经济的发展而逐步提高的。因而绝大多数教师的积极性、主动性较前更为高涨。表现在政治上，要求进步和提高思想水平；在工作上要搞好业务，改进教学，并积极参加各项学习，努力提高工作能力，愿为国家培养社会主义青年一代，贡献更多的力量。（附图片）
