Strengthening the Unity Between Party and Non-Party Intellectuals
Luo Longji's Speech

Last winter, when I went to Sichuan for inspection, I came into contact with issues concerning senior intellectuals. Recently, I chaired the symposiums of NPC deputies and CPPCC members on intellectual issues, and I heard many reflections on the issues of intellectuals. Now I would like to share my personal experiences in this regard based on these materials.

Achievements and Shortcomings of the Past Year

First of all, we must acknowledge that since Premier Zhou Enlai successively delivered reports on the issue of intellectuals in January of last year, thanks to the efforts of the Party and the government, great achievements have been made nationwide in implementing the policy on intellectual issues. The salaries of intellectuals have been generally increased, and the issue of their treatment has been resolved. The working conditions of senior intellectuals, such as time, assistants, books, materials, instruments, and equipment, although not fully satisfactory everywhere today, have been improved to the extent possible. The arrangement and use of senior intellectuals have undergone extensive and appropriate adjustments. The most important point is that senior intellectuals generally feel trusted and supported by the Party and the government, which has strengthened their confidence and made them see their future. Senior intellectuals are no longer as depressed as they were a year ago, but are now excited; no longer as passive as they were a year ago, but are now active. Today, the old senior intellectuals have a new outlook. We should affirm this fact, and we must affirm it.

On the other hand, society is constantly developing, and the situation is constantly changing. Old problems are constantly being solved, and new problems are constantly emerging. As fellow members know from inspections and symposiums, there are still many problems concerning intellectuals. Here, I think there are two points worth noting. First, some people say: "Deputies and members inspect every year and reflect every time. Despite all the reflections, the problems remain problems." I think this statement is inappropriate and inconsistent with the facts. The Standing Committee of the NPC and the Standing Committee of the CPPCC have issued some materials regarding the responses and solutions to the problems of senior intellectuals by relevant units, which fully proves that the above pessimistic view is wrong. Second, the country is in a rapidly developing transition period, and there will be no one-size-fits-all solution to any problem, nor is it possible. Our responsibility can only be: to help the Party and the government to discover, study, and solve problems every day.

What problems still exist in the area of intellectuals today? In terms of arrangement and use, there are still some situations that need further adjustment. People who studied philosophy are compiling catalogs in libraries, people who studied law are doing accounting in government agencies, people who studied dye chemistry are teaching Chinese in middle schools, people who studied mechanical engineering are teaching history in middle schools, and there are still many senior intellectuals who studied social sciences, especially political science, law, and finance, who are nominally employed and paid in schools without teaching any courses. There are even cases of British returnees pulling carts and American returnees running cigarette stands among senior intellectuals scattered in society. Of course, these are just examples in individual regions and individual units. The intellectual issue group at this symposium suggested that the Party and the government issue a nationwide circular to conduct a general inspection of the implementation of the policy on intellectual issues, and I personally agree with this suggestion. This situation should be corrected. It is in the interest of intellectuals and the country that all existing senior intellectuals can make the best use of their talents and find their proper place.

When Premier Zhou Enlai put forward the policy on intellectual issues last year, the focus was on senior intellectuals, and the issues of ordinary intellectuals were to be resolved gradually. Now middle and lower-level intellectuals are also calling out, believing that senior intellectuals have received care from the Party and the government, while not enough care has been given to lower-level intellectuals, especially primary school teachers. In fact, the salary adjustment last year greatly increased the salaries of primary school teachers, and they generally expressed excitement. However, the workload of primary school teachers is already very heavy, and in some areas, cadres even drive them to act as handymen, copying for government agencies, promoting sales for bookstores, and digging wells, building dikes, drying grain, and guarding warehouses for rural areas and granaries. Primary school teachers are exhausted, and if they disobey orders, they will suffer undue blows. We heard the call: "Save the teachers of 63 million primary school children." The excessive discrimination and contempt of some cadres towards primary school teachers is indeed a deviation. This deserves the attention of the government and should be corrected.

Leading Cadres Should Take the Initiative to Improve Work

Today's key issue is still how to eliminate the divide between Party and non-Party members and enable Party member leading cadres and non-Party intellectuals to unite sincerely and cooperate harmoniously, so as to mobilize all forces that can be mobilized to serve the country's construction of a socialist society. Some intellectuals have a divide with Party members, and Premier Zhou Enlai raised this issue a year ago. Today's situation has seen some positive changes compared to a year ago. Through the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, the ranks of senior intellectuals have become purer. Party committees and governments at all levels have worked hard to implement the policy on intellectuals, strengthening the trust and support of senior intellectuals in the Party. Today, senior intellectuals generally are willing to enter socialist society under the leadership of the Party. They are not only willing to accept the leadership of the Party but also demand that the Party further strengthen concrete help and leadership. Fellow members, today's issue is how Party member cadres should improve their leadership methods, adapt to today's new situation, and completely eliminate the divide to achieve harmonious cooperation.

Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out a year ago that "the divide often comes from both sides," and instructed Party member cadres to "take the initiative to eliminate this divide." I believe this view is absolutely correct. Regarding the "proactive efforts" of Party member cadres, I would like to provide a few points for reference. To cite some specific examples from reflections, when improving the treatment of senior intellectuals and adopting a grading system, a few professors complained that the grading was unfair, emphasizing politics over academics, with Party and League members having higher grades and non-Party members having lower grades. When expanding opportunities for intellectuals to study and be trained, a few professors complained that the selection was unfair, selecting young people over old people, with Party and League members having more opportunities and non-Party members having fewer opportunities. These reflections are of course a minority and are one-sided. Nevertheless, this should prompt leading cadres to take the initiative to conduct inspections and see whether there are shortcomings in administrative work such as insufficient consultation and lack of democracy, and whether they are inadvertently committing the mistake of sectarianism. If the facts are indeed not so, the facts will provide those who complain with concrete and effective persuasive education. In my speech at the National People's Congress last year, I said: "Chairman Mao Zedong's call for letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is the right prescription for removing the divide between Party and non-Party members and strengthening unity." At that time, I believed that in a country with a population of 600 million, our ideology could only be based on "seeking common ground while reserving differences" and first seek unity. The aspects of "reserving differences" could allow a hundred flowers to bloom and a hundred schools of thought to contend, with everyone freely expressing their opinions based on their own views. This would not only reduce pent-up feelings and eliminate divides but also make the truth clearer through debate, with all rivers flowing to the sea in the end. However, what are the facts? In the past year, in the area of academic thought, "letting a hundred flowers bloom" has seen few flowers blooming, and "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" has seen too few schools contending. The fact that the two calls were put forward for too short a time may be one of the reasons. However, based on the reflected materials, the basic reason is that senior intellectuals generally have too many concerns and too much suspicion, so they dare not let flowers bloom and dare not let schools contend. In my opinion, the main reason for this phenomenon is that some Party member cadres and a small number of progressive non-Party members lack a correct understanding and appreciation of the two calls of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" and "letting a hundred schools of thought contend." After the two calls were put forward, they believed that today's society is already full of licentious words and rampant heresies, so they are enthusiastic about the work of respecting orthodoxy and defending the Way, taking on the role of Han Yu of today and prematurely advocating the argument of "blocking if there is no flow, stopping if there is no progress." They spare no effort in criticizing and attacking those who "let flowers bloom" and "let schools contend," seeking to rectify people's hearts, quell heresies, and transmit the orthodoxy. This has made senior intellectuals even more ideologically confused, at a loss, more withdrawn, hesitant, and more apprehensive, and they are even more "afraid and distant" from leading cadres and some progressives! This phenomenon is greatly detrimental to the development of the country's ideology and academics. This phenomenon deserves the serious inspection and "proactive efforts" of leading cadres and progressive non-Party members to effectively correct their own dogmatism.

Deepen Understanding and Eliminate Divides Between Each Other

The divide comes from both sides, and eliminating the divide requires joint efforts from both sides. If one side considers the other side ideologically backward, and the other side considers the first side academically ignorant, only seeing their own strengths while ignoring the strengths of the other party; only seeing the shortcomings of the other party while ignoring their own shortcomings, and cannot respect each other, learn from each other, and help each other, then the divide between "backwardness" and "ignorance" is difficult to eliminate.

Eliminating the divide is a matter of thorough understanding and knowledge on both sides. In my personal opinion, in addition to studying Marxist-Leninist theory, we old intellectuals should also study the history of the CCP and the history of the Chinese revolution. In this way, we can understand what difficult revolutionary struggles the veteran cadres have gone through and what difficult political training they have undergone. Veteran cadres are more frank in their language, more honest in their behavior, more severe in their criticism, and more fierce in their struggle. This is a habit developed in a long revolutionary life. This is the characteristic of revolutionary cadres. This is precisely the advantage of revolutionary cadres. This is what non-Party intellectuals must understand and recognize. Leading cadres, having transitioned from military revolutionary work to positions of leadership in culture and education, should, of course, study new businesses in order to strengthen concrete leadership. However, when uniting, educating, and transforming old intellectuals, in addition to mastering Marxism-Leninism, they should also read Chinese historical books such as the "Zizhi Tongjian." In this way, they can become familiar with the historical background and cultural traditions of Chinese society and understand the characteristics of senior intellectuals who grew up in the Chinese scholar-official class. The concepts of fame and fortune, personal plans, and the so-called "taking care of oneself alone" and "protecting oneself by being wise" constitute a set of characteristics for the scholar-official class, which are also the unfortunate weaknesses of old intellectuals. They are the legacy of thousands of years of feudal society, and more than a hundred years of semi-colonial education have intensified them. Thoroughly eliminating the influence of this kind of ideological idealism is not something that can be achieved overnight. This requires the sympathy, help, and patient education of leading cadres.

Since the knowledge of intellectuals has reached a "high" level, his age must also have reached the "old" stage, he is the "scholar" in the so-called scholar-official class in old Chinese society. The Chinese "scholar" also has a positive side to politics, such as "taking the world as one's own responsibility," "everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world," and so on. "Scholars" are not people who are willing to be lonely and do not care about politics, it depends on how the leader can enable them to play a positive role in serving the country. The "scholar" in old Chinese society had such a traditional concept: "If I am treated as a national scholar, I must repay with the behavior of a national scholar; if I am treated as a common person, I must repay with the behavior of a common person." If they agree, then "a scholar dies for his confidant"; if they disagree, then "a scholar can be killed but not humiliated." For thousands of years, feudal society in China has indeed had a set of leadership skills for this kind of arrogant "scholar," namely, the so-called "treating scholars with courtesy" and "visiting the thatched cottage three times," and so on. In the old society of China, there were few who were willing to be the sharp-edged Mao Sui, and many who were willing to be Zhuge Liang waiting to be visited in Longzhong. If they were visited three times, they would surely do their best. I am not saying that in today's new society, we must still use the old ways of "treating scholars with courtesy" and "visiting the thatched cottage three times" to unite senior intellectuals, this is absolutely not the case.
I must point out that today's method of unity through criticism, struggle, and transformation is contradictory to the "courtesy" and "lower" expected by the "scholar." How to unify this contradiction, how to combine Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, arouse the enthusiasm of intellectuals, and eliminate divides between each other, depends on the "proactive efforts" of leading cadres.

At present, when Party member leading cadres get along and work with old intellectuals, they should clearly distinguish the boundaries between the individual and the Party in certain matters. Leading cadres may make deviations in implementing policies, and individuals may make mistakes. On the one hand, one cannot regard individual deviations as policy deviations, and even more cannot regard individual mistakes as Party mistakes. On the other hand, accepting the leadership of the Party is not entirely the same as accepting the leadership of individual Party members, and the prestige of individual Party members is not equal to the prestige of the Party. Criticizing individual Party members, regardless of whether the criticism is appropriate or not, is not equal to being anti-Party, let alone being counter-revolutionary. In the future, we must deeply understand Chairman Mao's instructions on "how to resolve contradictions among the people" and on "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" to deal with problems. In this way, the relationship between the Party and non-Party members will naturally gradually become harmonious.

The Future Tasks of Democratic Parties

Finally, regarding the issue of intellectuals, I would like to talk about my personal views on the future tasks of our democratic parties. Taking our China Democratic League as an example, in the past few years, all members of our Democratic League have done some work in self-education and transformation, as well as in uniting and educating upper-level intellectuals. Our work has achievements and shortcomings. Since the leadership party put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," the responsibilities of our democratic parties have increased. How to further do our work well and accomplish our mission is a serious topic for us at present. During this inspection, we heard reflections such as: the work of some people in the democratic parties is "adding flowers to the brocade and fueling the fire," only observing the trend, looking at the climate, labeling people, and throwing cold punches. These reflections deserve our deep reflection. Under the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," we should truly become assistants to the leading party in the future, and we should sincerely accept the leadership of the Party and frankly offer criticisms to the Party. We must earnestly implement "mutual supervision." On the other hand, we must recognize that today's senior intellectuals generally have made progress and improvements in their thinking. The vast majority of elderly senior intellectuals are skilled in their professions and have specialized knowledge. We should diligently approach them, understand them, humbly learn from them, and sincerely help them. We should represent their interests, reflect their problems, assist them in overcoming difficulties, encourage them to contribute their opinions, unite them to learn from each other, and transform together. This is the task of every member of our democratic parties, and I would like to encourage our comrades from all democratic parties to work together!

    加强党与非党知识分子的团结
    罗隆基的发言
    去年冬天我到四川去视察的时候，曾经接触到高级知识分子方面的问题，最近我负责主持人大代表和政协委员关于知识分子问题小组的座谈会，又听到了许多有关知识分子问题的反映，现在我根据这些材料来谈谈个人在这方面的体会。
    一年来的成绩和缺点
    首先，我们必须承认，从周恩来总理旧年1月先后发表了关于知识分子问题的报告后，由于党和政府的努力，在贯彻对知识分子问题的政策上，在全国范围内有了很大的成绩。知识分子的工资普遍地提高了，知识分子的待遇问题解决了。高级知识分子的工作条件，如时间、助手、图书资料、仪器设备等问题，到今天尽管不能处处尽满人意，但在可能范围内，都得到了改善。高级知识分子的安排和使用，有了广泛的和适当的调整。最重要的一点是，一般高级知识分子都感觉得到了党和政府的信任和支持，因此，高级知识分子就增强了自己的信心，看到了自己的前途。一般高级知识分子不再像一年前的消沉，现在兴奋起来了；不再像一年前的消极，现在积极起来了。今天旧的高级知识分子，有了新的气象。这个事实，我们应该肯定，并且必须肯定。
    另一方面，社会是不断地在发展，情况是不断地在变化。旧问题是不断地在解决；新问题是不断地在产生。各位委员从视察中和座谈会中当然都知道，当前知识分子的问题仍然还是不少。在这里，我认为有两点值得大家注意。第一，有人说：
  “代表委员们年年视察，次次反映，反映尽管反映，问题还是问题”，我认为这种说法是不妥当的，是与事实不符合的。人大常委会和政协常委会就印发了一些有关单位答复解决高级知识分子问题的材料，这就充分地证明上面这种悲观论调是错误的。第二，国家正在一个发展很快的过渡时期中，对任何方面的问题，一劳永逸的解决办法是不会有的，也是不可能有的。我们的责任只能是：帮助党和政府，天天发现问题，研究问题，并且解决问题。
    当前，在知识分子方面，还存在些什么问题呢？在安排和使用方面，还有某些需要进一步调整的情况。学哲学的人在图书馆编书目，学法律的人在机关里做会计，学染料化学的人在中学教语文，学机械工程的人在中学教历史，学社会科学，特别是学政法、财经的高级知识分子，在学校挂名领薪，而没有开课的人还是不少，甚至散居在社会上的高级知识分子中，还有英国留学生拉板车，美国留学生摆烟摊的情形。这当然只是个别地区和个别单位的事例。这次知识分子问题小组座谈会建议党和政府通令全国，普遍检查贯彻对知识分子问题的政策的情况，我个人是同意这种建议的。这种情况是应该加以纠正的。国家现有的高级知识分子都能各尽所长，各得其所，这是知识分子的利益，这也正是国家的利益。
    旧年周恩来总理提出对知识分子问题政策的时候，重点放在高级知识分子方面，对一般普通知识分子问题，准备逐步地来解决。现在中、下层知识分子又起来呼吁了，认为高级知识分子得到了党和政府的照顾，而对小知识分子，特别对小学教师的照顾不够。其实旧年工资调整，对小学教师的工资提高了很多，他们普遍表示兴奋。但是小学教师教书的工作量已经很重，而有些地区的干部还要驱使他们充当杂役，替机关抄写，替书店推销，替农村打井筑堤，替粮库晒谷守仓。小学教师疲于奔命，不听命令，就要受到不应有的打击。我们听到这样的呼吁：“救救六千三百万小学儿童的老师吧”。某些干部过分地歧视和轻视小学教师，的确是一种偏差。这是值得政府注意的，是应该加以纠正的。
    领导干部要主动努力改进工作
    今天的关键问题，仍然是怎样消除党与非党的隔膜，使党员领导干部同党外知识分子，精诚团结，融洽合作，这样才能调动一切可以调动的力量，为祖国建设社会主义社会服务。一部分知识分子与党员之间有隔膜，周恩来总理在一年前就提出这样一个问题来了。今天的情况比一年前有了某些好的变化，经过肃反运动，高级知识分子的队伍更纯洁了。各级党和政府努力贯彻对知识分子的政策，加强了高级知识分子对党的信任和拥护。今天一般高级知识分子是愿意在党的领导之下，进到社会主义社会，他们不只愿意接受党的领导，而且要求党进一步地加强具体帮助和领导。诸位委员，今天的问题是党员干部怎样来改进领导方法，适应今天的新形势，彻底消除隔膜，以达到融洽合作的目的。
    周恩来总理在一年前就指出，“隔膜常常是从双方面来的”，同时又指示党员干部“必须主动努力消除这种隔膜”。我认为这种见解是绝对正确的。在党员干部的“主动努力”方面，我愿意提供几点参考意见。举些反映中的具体的事例来说，改善高级知识分子的待遇，采用评级制，少数教授埋怨评级不公平，重政治不重学术，党团员等级高，党外人等级低。扩大知识分子进修培养的机会，少数教授埋怨选拔不公平，选青年不选老年，党团员机会多，党外人机会少。这种反映当然是少数的，并且是片面的。尽管如此，这就值得领导干部主动努力，进行检查，看在行政工作上是否有协商不足，民主不够的缺点，看是否是在无意中犯了宗派主义的毛病。事实果真不是如此，事实就会给埋怨者以具体有效的说服教育。旧年在人民代表大会的发言中我曾说过：“毛泽东主席百花齐放、百家争鸣的号召是扫除党与非党间隔膜，加强团结的对症良方”，当时我以为在一个六亿人口的国家，我们的思想意识，只能在“求同存异”的基础上先求团结，其“存异”的方面，可以百花齐放、百家争鸣，各就所见，畅所欲言，这不仅可以减少郁积，消除隔膜，并且是非愈辩愈明，真理愈争愈显，百川异流，将来总是同归于海。然而事实怎样？一年来在学术思想方面，“百花齐放”，放者不多，“百家争鸣”，鸣者太少。两个号召提出来的时间太短，可能是原因之一。但根椐反映的材料，基本原因还在一般高级知识分子顾虑太多，猜疑太重，以致花不敢放，家不敢鸣。这种现象的发生，在我看来，主要是某些党员干部和党外少数进步人士，对“百花齐放”、“百家争鸣”这两个号召，缺乏正确的认识和体会。他们认为两个号召提出以后，今天社会已经是淫辞放恣，异端猖獗，他们就热心于尊统卫道的工作，以今之韩愈自任，过急过早地倡导“不塞不流，不止不行”的议论，对思想学术的“放”者“鸣”者，不惜口诛笔伐，“包抄”“围剿”，以求正人心，息邪说，传道统。这就使一般旧知识分子更加思想混乱，无所适从，更加退缩不前，逡巡不进，更加瞻前顾后，栗栗危惧，而对领导干部和一些进步人士就更加“畏而远之”了！这种现象对国家思想学术的发展是大有妨碍的。这种现象是值得领导干部和党外进步人士，认真检查，“主动努力”来切实纠正自己的教条主义的。
    加深了解，消除彼此间的隔膜
    隔膜是从双方面来的，消除隔膜必须双方面共同努力，倘此方认彼方为思想落后，而彼方认此方为学术外行，只看见了自己的长处，却忽视了对方的长处；只看见了对方的短处，却忽视了自己的短处。不能互相尊重，互相学习，互相帮助，那末“落后”与“外行”之间的隔膜，是很难消灭的。
    消除隔膜，是彼此双方彻底认识和了解的问题。在我个人看来，我们旧知识分子在学习马列主义理论外，还要好好地学习中共党史和中国革命史。这样，我们才能明白革命老干部经过了怎样困苦的革命斗争，受过了怎样艰难的政治锻炼。革命老干部语言比较坦率，行为比较憨直，批评比较严厉，斗争比较猛烈。这是长期革命生活中养成的习惯。这是革命干部的特性。这正是革命干部的优点。这是党外知识分子必须了解认识的。领导干部从军事革命工作转到文教领导工作的岗位上来，固然应该研究新的业务，以便加强具体领导，但在团结、教育和改造旧知识分子的时候，掌握了马列主义以外，也还应该读读“资治通鉴”这类中国的史籍。这样就能熟悉中国社会的历史背景和文化传统，明了从中国士大夫阶层中成长起来的高级知识分子的特性。名利观念，个人打算，以及所谓的“独善其身”。“明哲保身”这一大套构成士大夫立身处世的特点，也正是旧知识分子不幸而有的弱点。它们是几千年封建社会的遗产，而一百余年的半殖民地教育，也使它们变本加厉了。彻底扫除这类思想上唯心主义的影响，不是一朝一夕之功。这就要求领导干部的同情帮助和耐心教育。
    知识分子的知识既然达到了“高”的水准，他的年龄也必定活到了“老”的阶段，他就是中国旧社会里所谓的士大夫阶层中的“士”。中国的“士”对政治亦有他积极的一面，例如“以天下为己任”，
  “天下兴亡，匹夫有责”等等。“士”不是甘心寂寞，不问政治的人，就看领导者怎样能够使他们发挥积极的一方面为国家服务而已。中国旧社会中的“士”有这样一套传统观念：“以国士待我者，我必以国士报之；以众人待我者，我必以众人报之”，合则“士为知己者死”，不合，则
  “士可杀不可辱”。中国几千年的封建社会，对这类自高自大的“士”，亦确有一套领导的艺术，即所谓“礼贤下士”、“三顾茅庐”等等。中国旧社会中的“士”，愿做脱颖而出的毛遂者少，愿做陇中待访的诸葛亮者多。若得三顾茅庐，必肯鞠躬尽瘁。我不是说在今天的新社会里，还必须用“礼贤下士”、“三顾茅庐”的旧方式来团结高级知识分子，这绝对不是的。
  我必须指出，今天批评、斗争和改造的团
  结方式同“士”所期望的“礼”之“下”之是有矛盾的。怎样来统一这个矛盾，怎样把马列主义同中国革命实践相结合，鼓起知识分子的积极性，消除彼此间的隔膜，这就靠领导干部的“主动努力”了。
    在目前来说，党员领导干部同旧知识分子相处共事的时候，在某些事情上，应该把个人和党的界线分别清楚。领导干部执行政策是可能发生偏差的，个人是可能犯错误的。一方面，不可以把个人的偏差看成政策的偏差，更不可以把个人的错误看成党的错误。另一方面，接受党的领导，不完全同于接受党员个人的领导，党员个人的威望不等于党的威望。批评个别党员，不管批评是否妥当，不等于反党，更不等于反革命。我们今后必须深切地体会毛主席关于“怎样解决人民内部的矛盾”，关于“百花齐放、百家争鸣”这一切指示来处理问题。这样，党与非党的感情就自然逐步趋于融洽了。
    民主党派今后的任务
    最后，关于知识分子问题，我愿就个人的见解谈一点我们民主党派今后的任务。就拿我们中国民主同盟来说，几年来我们民盟全体盟员在自我教育和改造以及团结教育中上层知识分子方面，是做了些工作的。我们的工作有成绩，也有缺点。自从领导党提出了“长期共存，互相监督”的政策以后，我们各民主党派的责任加重了。怎样进一步来做好我们的工作，完成我们的使命，这是我们当前一个严重的课题。在这次视察中，我们听到这样的反映：民主党派中有些人的工作是“锦上添花，火上加油”，只是观风色，看气候，扣帽子，打冷拳。这些反映是值得我们深切反省的。在“长期共存，互相监督”的政策下，我们今后应真正成为领导党的助手，我们应该真诚地接受党的领导，坦率地对党提出批评。我们要认真地贯彻“互相监督”，另一方面，我们必须承认，今天一般旧的高级知识分子，思想上都有了进步和提高。极大部分的老年高级知识分子是业有专精，学有专长的。我们应该殷勤地接近他们，了解他们，虚心向他们学习，并且竭诚帮助他们。我们要代表他们的利益，反映他们的问题。协助他们克服困难，鼓励他们贡献意见，团结他们互相学习，共同改造。这是我们民主党派每个成员的任务，我愿同我们各民主党派的同志们共同勉励！
