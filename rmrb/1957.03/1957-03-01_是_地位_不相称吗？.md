Is it a mismatch of "status"?
By our reporter, Xi Ping

This is a true story that happened in Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 17.

Late at night, the light was still on in the room of Gong Baomei, a roving frame operator. Gong Baomei, exhausted from a day's work, sat at a table, forcing herself to read a letter. Her hands trembled as she read, and she sobbed. Finally, she simply collapsed on the table and wept bitterly.

A corner of the letter lying on the table was stained with tears, but some of the writing could still be made out. It was Gong Baomei's most familiar handwriting: her husband's. Her husband was a student at a textile technical school in Zhengzhou Cotton Textile Mill, and he would be graduating in three or four months. But the letter did not bring the good news of his upcoming graduation and job assignment. The father of four had written to propose ending their ten-year marriage. The letter read: "I am now a soon-to-be college graduate with a job assignment, while you are a low-cultured roving frame operator in a yarn mill. Our statuses are too far apart, and it is difficult for us to live together. I hope you will calmly consider this..."

Ten years ago, Gong Baomei was an outstanding girl at Shanghai Yufeng Yarn Mill. She was young and beautiful, healthy, with large, dark eyes on a fair face. Her nimble hands made the spindles seem to blur. Many young men pursued this girl madly. Among a large group of young people, Gong Baomei chose Zhang Jiayu, a raggedly dressed, impoverished cleaner. When the news spread, people in the workshop were shocked. According to the old views of the time, a skilled roving frame operator had a much higher status than a sweeper. In terms of wages, Gong Baomei earned twice as much as Zhang Jiayu. Why did she love someone with a lower status than herself? Gong Baomei smiled and said to her sisters: she didn't love status or money, she loved the person, because Zhang Jiayu was honest, motivated, and would be successful in the future.

Gong Baomei and Zhang Jiayu quickly prepared for their wedding. She took out her savings from years of work, bought furniture, clothes, and daily necessities, and moved into Zhang Jiayu's almost empty room. Zhang Jiayu was surprised and grateful for Gong Baomei's sincere love.

After the liberation of Shanghai, Zhang Jiayu was promoted from sweeper to machine cleaner in the workshop. Both young people made rapid progress. Encouraged by his wife, Zhang Jiayu studied hard, telling her that he would strive to become a cultured and skilled person in the future. In the summer of 1952, the factory decided to recommend a group of promising workers to study at the Shanghai Textile Industrial School, and Zhang Jiayu was included on the list.

This news brought indescribable joy to the small family. In the days before Zhang Jiayu went to school, Gong Baomei worked tirelessly to prepare everything for him. She bought him a suitcase, and didn't let him take any of his old, worn-out clothes. She tried to make new ones, from shirts to cotton-padded clothes. She also made him a set of woolen serge clothes and bought him a watch. On the night before Zhang Jiayu left, Gong Baomei was on the night shift. She packed the clothes in the suitcase, and waited until the shift whistle was about to blow before gently waking her sleeping husband, repeatedly instructing him, and then briskly walking to the factory. How many happy thoughts stirred in her mind!

From then on, Gong Baomei shouldered the full responsibility of the family. She had to work in the factory, take care of the children, and manage the household chores. Excessive labor made this once-healthy textile worker grow weaker day by day. The rosy complexion disappeared from her face, but she had no complaints.

At this time, Zhang Jiayu lived in another world, where everything was so new and interesting to him. He lived in happiness. At first, he would still go back on Sundays to see his wife and children, but later he returned home less and less often. He began to feel disgusted with his family, finding everything unpleasant, and the warmth of the family gradually faded in his heart.

At first, Gong Baomei did not understand the changes in Zhang Jiayu's mood. Every time he came home and got angry, she always thought it was because the schoolwork was too heavy, making Zhang Jiayu feel bad. When he came back, she tried to send the children away so they wouldn't disturb him.

Once, Zhang Jiayu didn't come home for several weeks in a row. Gong Baomei thought he was sick, so on a day off, she took the fried eggs and glutinous rice balls that her husband liked to eat, and went to the school with the children to visit him. The school was very far from the factory. After finally arriving at the school, she learned that Zhang Jiayu was not sick. He had gone out with his classmates. Gong Baomei and the children waited in the school's reception room. But they waited and waited, from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., and the children were crying with hunger. At this time, Zhang Jiayu and his classmates returned from their outing. He casually swung a newly sprouted willow branch in his hand and hummed something. When he walked into the school gate and suddenly saw his wife and children waiting for him in the reception room, his face changed drastically. After the classmates had all gone inside, he rushed into the reception room, his face darkened, and he shouted furiously, "Who told you to come here? What is this place? Looking at the way you are, aren't you deliberately trying to embarrass me?"

Where had Gong Baomei embarrassed her husband? Was it shameful to have a worker wife? Could a worker not come to college? ... Her husband's unreasonable scolding made Gong Baomei angry and sad, and she began to anticipate her husband's terrible changes.

Sure enough, not long after, Zhang Jiayu finally filed for divorce, and the two came to the court. Zhang Jiayu gave three reasons for the divorce: first, it was an arranged marriage; second, they had never had a good relationship; and third, their respective statuses were mismatched. The first two reasons were fabricated by him. The third reason was only his own opinion.

"I will soon graduate from school, and I will become a technician, even an engineer, in a textile factory. My wife should at least be a workshop administrator..." Zhang Jiayu stood with his hands in his pockets, head held high, stating his reasons confidently. He loudly told the judge, "Gong Baomei is a worker with a low level of education. Her status is too mismatched with mine. How can there still be feelings? It is difficult for me to continue living with her!"

Originally, things had developed to this point, and Gong Baomei no longer needed to waste her love on this person, but the kind and overly weak Gong Baomei did not do so. She tearfully asked the court to grant them a chance, and she was determined to wait for Zhang Jiayu to change his mind.

Since Zhang Jiayu formally filed for divorce, he completely ignored the family's living expenses (although the state still paid him a monthly allowance), and even refused to repay the debts incurred for buying clothes for him to go to school that year. Gong Baomei shouldered the heavy burden of supporting four children alone, and also had to repay his debts. Life even forced her to pick up rotten vegetables at the market, or pour out leftover food in the factory's canteen, to maintain a minimal living standard. Sometimes, in order to let the children eat their fill, she went to work on an empty stomach. One hot evening, Gong Baomei suddenly fainted in the workshop, her face pale and her limbs weak. When her sisters helped her up and woke her up, she could no longer hide her pain, and tearfully told of her unfortunate experiences.

After the news spread, countless hands of sympathy and support reached out to her from the factory. When the factory's trade union heard that Gong Baomei had no rice to eat, they sent rice. Knowing that the children had no clothes to wear, they sent cloth. Many comrades ran to comfort her, urging her to stand strong in the collective life. The overly weak Gong Baomei began to strengthen. She worked and studied hard, and last year was her best year of work in many years, and she was finally named an advanced producer of the factory.

In our country, is there anything more glorious or of higher status than an advanced producer who has made outstanding achievements in labor? But Zhang Jiayu had a different view of status. He still insisted on divorcing his wife. The first letter he sent from Zhengzhou after his internship still demanded a divorce. Zhang Jiayu didn't know that the result of doing so was that it was not his wife who lost "status," but himself. His "status" among the masses in the factory had been lost completely. The workers angrily rebuked him and mocked him, even though he is now a college student.

Abandon those dirty, outdated "status" concepts, and return to the right path!

    是“地位”不相称吗？
    本报记者  习平
    这是上海国棉十七厂里发生的一件真实的事情。
    深夜，粗纱间挡车女工龚宝妹的房间里还亮着灯。劳累了一天的龚玉妹，支撑着疲劳的身体坐在一张桌子旁边，读着一封信。她的手发着抖，一边读，一边抽泣，最后就索性伏在桌上，呜呜地痛哭起来。
    摆在桌上的一张信纸已被泪水沾湿了一角，但还可以看出上边的一些字迹。这是龚宝妹最熟悉的字：丈夫的笔迹。她的丈夫是一个正在郑州棉纺织厂里实习的纺织技术学校的学生，再过三、四个月就要毕业了。但这封信带来的不是他即将毕业分配工作的喜讯。这个已有四个孩子的父亲来信提出要和她终结十年的夫妻关系。信上写道：“我现在已经是一个即将分配工作的大学毕业生，而你呢，却是一个文化很低的纱厂里的挡车女工，我们的地位过分悬殊，很难再有共同生活的可能，希望你冷静考虑这一点…………”
    十年以前，龚宝妹是上海裕丰纱厂里一个出色的姑娘，她年轻漂亮，身体健壮，白净的脸上长着一双大而黑的眼睛，灵巧的双手拨弄起纱锭来，简直使人眼花撩乱。许多青年人疯狂地追求着这个姑娘。龚宝妹在一大群青年中，竟选中了一个衣衫褴褛、生活困苦的清洁工人张家玉。当这个消息传出时，车间里的人们都大吃一惊。按那时候人们的旧看法，一个有技术的挡车工，要比一个扫地工的地位高得多，从工资来说，龚宝妹的工资就比张家玉的工资多一倍。她为什么要去爱这个地位比自己低的人呢？龚宝妹笑着对她的姐妹们说：她爱的不是地位和钱，她爱的是人，因为张家玉为人老实，有上进心，将来是会有出息的。
    龚宝妹和张家玉很快就筹备结婚了。她拿出了她几年来的劳动积蓄，购买了家具、衣服，还买了日用品，搬到了张家玉那间几乎一无所有的空屋里。张家玉对于龚宝妹的这种真挚的爱情，真是又惊喜、又感激。
    上海解放后，张家玉由扫地工提升为车间的揩车工。这一对青年人的进步都很快。张家玉在妻子的勉励下，刻苦学习文化，他向妻子表示，一定要在将来争取做一个有文化、有技术的人。1952年暑期，厂里决定保送一批有培养前途的工人到上海纺织工业学校去学习，张家玉被列入了这个名单。
    这个消息给小家庭带来了无法形容的快乐。在张家玉到学校去的前几天里，龚宝妹日夜不停地为他筹划一切。她给他买了一只皮箱，日常穿破的衣服一件都不让他带去，从衬衣到棉衣，都想办法做新的。另外还给他做了一套毛哔叽的衣服和买了一只手表。在张家玉临走的前一天晚上，龚宝妹正当夜班。她把箱子里的衣服整理好，一直等到快要拉上班汽笛的时候，才轻轻地推醒了酣睡的丈夫，叮嘱了又叮嘱，然后轻快地向厂里走去。多少幸福的想法在她心头翻腾啊！
    龚宝妹从此担负起家庭的全部责任，她要进厂做工，还要带孩子，操持家务。过度的劳累，使得这个本来健壮的纺织女工，身体一天天衰弱下来了，红晕在脸上消失了，但她毫无怨言。
    这时候张家玉生活在另一个天地里，那里的一切对于他来说，都是那么新鲜，有趣。他在幸福中生活着。最初他还在星期天回去看看妻子和孩子，但后来回家的次数越来越少了。他开始对家庭发生了厌恶的情绪，觉得什么都不顺眼，家庭的温暖在他的心头渐渐淡薄了。
    起初龚宝妹还不理解张家玉心情的变化，每次他回家发脾气时，她总以为是学校里功课太忙，使得张家玉心情不好，在他回来的时候，便尽量打发孩子走开不来打扰。
    有一次，张家玉一连好几个星期没有回家。龚宝妹以为他病了，就在一个休息的日子，带了她丈夫喜欢吃的荷包蛋和糯米团，同孩子们一齐到学校里去探望他。学校离厂非常远，好容易到了学校，一打听原来张家玉没有病，他和同学们出去玩去了。龚宝妹和孩子们就在学校的传达室等着。可是左等不来，右等不来，从上午九时一直等到下午四时，孩子们已饿得哇哇叫了。这时候，张家玉和同学们郊游回来了，他的手里轻松地摇着一支刚抽芽的杨柳枝，嘴里还哼着什么。当他走进校门，突然看到传达室里等候着他的妻子和孩子们的时候，他的脸刷地变了。等同学们都走进去以后，他就冲进了传达室，面孔一沉，狂怒地叫了起来：“谁叫你们来的？这里是什么地方？看你这付样子，不是存心要丢我的脸吗？”
    龚宝妹在什么地方给她的丈夫丢了脸呢？难道有一个工人妻子，就是丢脸的事情么？难道一个工人就不能到大学里来么？……丈夫岂有此理的责骂，使龚宝妹又气愤，又悲伤，她开始预感到丈夫的可怕的变化。
    果然，过了不久，张家玉终于提出了离婚的要求，两个人一起来到了法院里。张家玉提出了三点离婚的理由：一、他们是包办婚姻；二、一向感情不好；三、相互的地位不相称。前两点理由是他捏造的。第三点也只是他自己认为的理由。
   “我很快就要在学校毕业了，我将成为纺织厂的一个技术人员，甚至工程师，我的妻子至少应当是一个车间管理员，……”张家玉两手插在裤袋里，昂着头，振振有词地陈述着他的理由。他大声对审判员说：“龚宝妹是一个工人，文化很低，她的地位与我的地位太不相称，这怎么还会有感情呢？我很难再和她共同生活下去！”
    本来，事情发展到这种地步，龚宝妹已无需再把自己的爱情虚掷在这个人的身上了，但善良而又过分软弱的龚宝妹没有这样做，她流着泪要求法院成全他们，她决心要等待张家玉的回心转意。
    张家玉自从正式提出了离婚要求之后，就对家庭的生活费用完全不管了（虽然国家每月仍然发给他津贴），甚至当年为他上学购置衣物所欠下来的债务，也不肯偿还。龚宝妹一个人负起了瞻养四个孩子的沉重担子，还要为他还债。生活甚至逼得她不得不到菜场上拾烂菜，或者到厂的大食堂里倒剩菜，来维持最低的生活。有时为了让孩子能吃饱，她就饿着肚皮去上工。在一个闷热的傍晚，龚宝妹突然面色惨白、四肢无力地昏倒在车间里了。等姐妹们把她搀起来救醒的时候，她再也掩藏不住自己的痛苦，便流着泪，诉说了她不幸的遭遇。
    消息传开后，厂里无数同情支援的手向她伸来了。厂的工会听说龚宝妹家里没有米吃，就把米送去。知道孩子没衣服穿，就把布送去。许多同志跑去劝慰她，要她坚强地站到集体生活里来。过分软弱的龚宝妹开始坚强起来了，她发奋地工作着、学习着，去年成了她入厂多年来工作最好的一年，最后她被评为厂的先进生产者。
    在我们国家里，难道还有比在劳动上做出了出色成绩的先进生产者更荣耀、更有地位的吗？但张家玉对地位的看法不同，他依然坚持要求和妻子离婚，他到郑州去实习以后寄来的第一封信，仍然提出了离婚的要求。张家玉不知道，他这样做的结果，损失了“地位”的不是他的妻子，而正是他自己。他在本厂群众中间的“地位”已丧失殆尽了，工人们愤愤不平地责备他、嘲讽他，尽管他今天已经是一个大学生。
    抛弃那些肮脏的早已过时了的“地位”观念，回到正路上来吧！
