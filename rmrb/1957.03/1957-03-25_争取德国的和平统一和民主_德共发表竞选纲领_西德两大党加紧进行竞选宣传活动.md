Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 22nd: The "Neues Deutschland" published on the 21st the election program of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party for the upcoming federal parliamentary elections in West Germany this year.

The program demands: halting the expansion of the military in West Germany, abolishing conscription, West Germany withdrawing from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, participating in a pan-European security treaty, easing tensions, and guaranteeing the social security of the working people.

The program calls on Communists and Social Democrats to jointly launch a powerful anti-militarist people's movement in all extra-parliamentary struggles. The program states: Only through resolute anti-militarist struggle can Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union be defeated in the federal parliamentary elections, ensuring the beginning of a new political era in West Germany.

The program states: The primary national aspiration of the German people is reunification. The only realistic path to achieving German reunification is: a pan-German committee composed of representatives elected by the two Germanys to prepare for free all-German elections, through which a pan-German National Assembly will be generated, to formulate a pan-German constitution, and to organize a unified government.

In addition, the program also advocates implementing broad social reforms in West Germany, increasing workers' wages, implementing a forty-hour work week, increasing pensions, taking resolute measures against those who raise prices, and implementing democratic land reform to solve the land problem of small and medium-sized farmers, and so on.

Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: Bonn News: The West German Federal Cabinet has decided to hold the next West German general election on September 15th, re-electing members of the West German Federal Parliament. This date will be finalized after approval by the West German President. Although the election date is still several months away, West German political parties have long been engaged in various activities to win the votes of 30 million voters.

The issues of peace and German reunification and European security, which are of greatest concern to the German people, are among the central issues in the election campaigns of West German political parties. Recently, both the ruling and opposition parties in West Germany have made many statements on this issue.

After expressing support for banning thermonuclear weapons, Chancellor Adenauer recently stated that he would once again propose the establishment of a "military disengagement zone" between East and West. However, Adenauer's party does not actually intend to change its fundamental policies. In his recent reply to Bulganin, Adenauer insisted on using the so-called "free elections," the unworkable "Eden Plan," as the only solution to the German reunification problem. He also insisted on participating in the North Atlantic military bloc and accelerating the establishment of a new West German army.

Erich Ollenhauer, chairman of the Social Democratic Party, Adenauer's main opponent in this year's election, has repeatedly stated that he advocates the establishment of an all-European collective security system, including the United States and the Soviet Union, to replace the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He also said that West Germany must be prepared to withdraw from the North Atlantic group and stop rebuilding its armed forces in order to achieve German reunification. However, he also stated that West Germany can only withdraw from the North Atlantic group after it is certain that German reunification and a European security system can be achieved through negotiations. He rejected the proposal from the German Democratic Republic for the two German governments to negotiate on the issue of reunification.

The Free Democratic Party, the third largest party in West Germany, also supports the establishment of a European collective security system. However, this party also does not support contact with the government of the German Democratic Republic and advocates West German rearmament and participation in the North Atlantic group.

Another major issue in the election campaign is the economic issue. Around the issue of successive price increases in West Germany, the Social Democratic Party has launched a fierce attack on the Adenauer government. West German political figures are also busy engaging in international activities related to the election campaign. Not long ago, Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer visited the United States to explain his party's policies to the Washington authorities in order to dispel American fears and win support. Adenauer has also announced that he will travel to the United States for his fifth visit in May in order to achieve "coordination" with the Washington authorities on the German issue.

### 争取德国的和平统一和民主　德共发表竞选纲领  西德两大党加紧进行竞选宣传活动

　  争取德国的和平统一和民主
　　德共发表竞选纲领
　  西德两大党加紧进行竞选宣传活动
    据新华社柏林22日电　“新德意志报”21日刊载了德国共产党中央委员会就西德今年将要举行的联邦议院选举发表的竞选纲领。
    纲领要求：停止在西德扩军，取消义务兵役制，西德退出北大西洋公约组织，参加全欧安全条约，缓和紧张局势，保证劳动人民的社会安全。
    纲领号召共产党人和社会民主党人，在所有议会以外的斗争中共同展开强大的、反军国主义的人民运动。纲领说：只有进行坚决的反军国主义的斗争，才会使阿登纳的基督教民主联盟在联邦议院选举中遭到失败，保证在西德开始一个新的政治时代。
    纲领说：德国人民首要的民族愿望是重新统一。实现德国统一的唯一现实道路是：由两个德国选出的代表组成全德委员会，筹备全德的自由选举，通过这样的选举产生全德的国民议会，制定全德的宪法，组织统一的政府。
    此外，纲领还主张在西德实行广泛的社会改革，增加工人的工资，实行四十小时工作周，增加养老金，对抬高物价者采取坚决的措施，实行民主的土地改革以解决中小农民的土地问题等等。
    据新华社23日讯　波恩消息：西德联邦内阁已经决定在9月15日举行西德下届大选，改选西德联邦议院的议员。这个日期经西德总统批准后就最后确定。虽然现在离大选日期还有好几个月，但是，西德各政党早就为争取三千万选民的选票而进行种种活动。
    德国人民最关心的和平和德国统一及欧洲安全问题，是西德各政党竞选宣传的中心问题之一。近来，西德的执政党和反对党对这个问题都发表了不少言论。
    总理阿登纳在表示赞成禁止热核子武器之后，不久以前又表示将再度提出在东西方之间建立“军事疏稀区”的问题。但是阿登纳的党其实并不打算改变它的根本政策。最近阿登纳在给布尔加宁的复信中坚持以所谓举行“自由选举”这个行不通的“艾登计划”作为解决德国统一问题的唯一方案。他还坚持参加北大西洋军事集团，加紧建立新的西德军队。
    今年大选中阿登纳党的劲敌社会民主党的主席奥伦豪尔一再说，他主张成立一个包括美国和苏联在内的全欧集体安全体系，来代替北大西洋公约组织。他还说，西德必须准备退出北大西洋集团和停止重建武装，以求得德国的重新统一。但是他又表示，必须等到确实知道德国重新统一和欧洲安全体系可以用谈判来取得以后，西德才可以退出北大西洋集团。他拒绝民主德国关于两个德国政府就统一问题进行谈判的建议。
    西德的第三大党自由民主党也赞成建立欧洲集体安全体系。但是这个党也不赞成同民主德国政府接触，并且主张西德重新武装和参加北大西洋集团。
    竞选宣传的另一个主要问题是经济问题。围绕着西德物价接连上涨的问题，社会民主党已经对阿登纳政府展开了猛烈的攻击。西德各政党人物还忙于从事同竞选有关的国际活动。不久以前，社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔曾经访问了美国，向华盛顿当局解释他的党的政策，以消除美国的疑惧，争取支持。阿登纳也已经宣布，他在五月里要到美国去作他的第五次访问，以便同华盛顿当局在德国问题上取得“协调”。
