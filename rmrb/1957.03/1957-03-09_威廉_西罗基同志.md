    Comrade Viliam Široký is an outstanding contemporary Czechoslovak political activist and a staunch fighter loyal to the cause of the working class. Comrade Široký was born on May 31, 1902, in Bratislava, now the capital of Slovakia, to a railway worker's family. At the age of fifteen, he worked on the railway and lived with railway workers for a long time. In 1921, he joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and became one of the founders of the Bratislava Party organization.
    In 1929, Czechoslovakia suffered a huge economic crisis, and capitalists launched a fierce attack on the working class to shift the burden of the crisis. To safeguard the interests of the working class, Comrade Široký actively mobilized workers and organized strike movements. In 1930, he was elected as a member of the Central Committee and the Politburo of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. In 1935, he was elected as one of the four secretaries of the CPCz Central Committee.
    Comrade Široký's spirit of fighting for the interests of the people is deeply loved by the broad masses of Czechoslovak working people. In 1935, he was elected as a member of parliament for the Trnavský region. However, his active involvement in political activities led to his arrest by the reactionary government.
    In 1938, imperialist countries such as Britain and France signed the Munich Agreement with Nazi Germany, selling out Czechoslovakia. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia firmly opposed this agreement, and Comrade Široký was one of the leaders of the Party at that time. However, under the dual threat of the bourgeois government's policy of surrender and the Nazi army, the Party's activities were forced to go underground. Široký and some other comrades left the country in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee. In 1941, Comrade Široký secretly returned to his homeland through the Carpathian Mountains and led the local people in the struggle against the Nazis. In July of the same year, he was arrested and imprisoned by the Nazi secret police. In prison, he sent out secret prison notes, the most famous of which was written on July 28, 1941, after being severely tortured by the Nazi secret police: "I will die gloriously—believing in the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and the people." In February 1945, Široký and Comrade Július Ďuriš, the current Czechoslovak Minister of Finance, took the opportunity to escape from the Nazi prison and joined the anti-German guerrillas.
    After the liberation of Czechoslovakia, Comrade Široký was elected Chairman of the Communist Party of Slovakia. From 1945 to 1953, he served as Deputy Prime Minister. From 1950 to February 1953, he also served as Minister of Foreign Affairs. In March 1953, after Comrade Zápotocký was elected President, Comrade Široký assumed the post of Prime Minister and has held it to this day. He is also a member of the Politburo of the CPCz Central Committee and Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Front. (Attached photo)
