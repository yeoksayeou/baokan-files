Liu Ruizhen is a Good Mother
By Our Reporter Zhang Wei

Liu Ruizhen, a housewife in her thirties, has seven children, the oldest fourteen and the youngest only nine months old. Her husband, Lao Zhao, is an electrician at the Yangtze River Bridge. Before the wage reform, his monthly income was 68 yuan. It was difficult for a family of nine to live on that amount, but Liu Ruizhen budgeted carefully, planned her expenses, and sewed and mended day and night. Not only did she avoid debt, but she even saved two yuan a month. After the wage reform last year, Lao Zhao was promoted to foreman, and his monthly income, including construction subsidies, totaled 94 yuan. This 94 yuan is still not generous for a family of nine, but after receiving her salary each month, she first buys rice, flour, oil, salt, and other necessities, sets aside money for vegetables, rent, utilities, Lao Zhao's Party membership dues, and union fees, then contributes one or two yuan to the mutual aid fund (voluntarily organized by family members of employees), buys four yuan of prize-winning savings, and finally deposits ten yuan in the bank as a reserve fund.

Liu Ruizhen never spends a penny carelessly, and she often tells her children, "It's not easy for your father to earn money through his labor. We all have to be thrifty and not compare ourselves with others in terms of food and clothing. Large clothes can be altered into smaller clothes, and torn clothes can still be worn after being mended. We only buy new clothes for those who have nothing to wear, and not everyone can get new clothes at the same time." Her words are deeply imprinted in the children's hearts. Her twelve-year-old daughter, Xiaoyun, has a T-shirt with a big hole in the shoulder, but she still wears it, unwilling to throw it away. Her mother said, "This shirt is torn, don't wear it anymore." Xiaoyun said, "I'll wear it at home." Her mother insisted that she take it off, so she had to. One day, Liu Ruizhen came back from outside and saw Xiaoyun sitting on the bed, sewing something with her head down. When she got closer, she realized that she was mending the T-shirt that she had taken off. Her mother said, "Don't mend it, didn't I tell you not to wear it?" Xiaoyun turned away, muttering as she sewed, "I won't wear it now, can't I wear it as an undershirt in winter?" Xiaoyun wore this torn shirt for another winter, and Liu Ruizhen only tore it up recently to make shoe lining.

The third child, Yong Sheng, is more naughty and doesn't study hard. He is still not a Young Pioneer in the fourth grade, so Liu Ruizhen is particularly concerned about him. One day, he came back from seeing a movie with the Young Pioneers, and sat alone without saying a word. Liu Ruizhen saw that he wasn't jumping around like usual, so she asked him, "Yong Sheng, are you angry with someone?" "No, I went to see a movie." "Then why are you unhappy?" "Everyone else has a red scarf, but I don't." Liu Ruizhen wanted to take this opportunity to guide him to talk about his shortcomings and consciously correct them. She pretended not to understand and said to Yong Sheng, "Your older brothers and sisters also have red scarves, shall I buy you one?" "A bought one doesn't count, it has to be issued by the school." "Then why does the school issue them to others, but not to you?" "The teacher said that I like to talk in class and my grades are not good." "If you only talk in class, of course you can't hear what the teacher is saying, so how can your grades be good? I think the problem is that you like to talk in class. Your older brothers and sisters wore red scarves in the third grade of elementary school, but you are already in the fourth grade and you still don't have a red scarf. You have to change in the future!" Yong Sheng saw his mother's concerned and sad expression, and quickly said to her, "I won't be naughty anymore, I will definitely listen to the teacher and my mother...". On "June 1st" Children's Day, Liu Ruizhen was busy in the kitchen when she suddenly heard Yong Sheng running back, shouting and jumping. As soon as he entered the door, he said, "Mom, I'm wearing a red scarf." He proudly looked at the red scarf on his chest, then looked at his mother. Liu Ruizhen looked at the child standing in front of her, the child's big, happy eyes shining, his chubby face flushed, and the newly hung red scarf on his chest. She thought, "Why is this child particularly beautiful today!"

Liu Ruizhen is particularly concerned about her husband. Usually, Liu Ruizhen and the children eat vegetarian dishes such as cabbage, tofu, and bean sprouts, but she always prepares some eggs for Lao Zhao and fries them for him when he gets off work. During vacations, she often accompanies Lao Zhao and takes the children out to play. The two of them chat and laugh like a newly married couple. On Sundays, she often goes shopping for groceries with Lao Zhao. Others ask her, "Do you even have to go grocery shopping together?" She says shyly, "I'm afraid that the vegetables I buy won't suit his taste."

The children see their mother caring for their father in this way, and they all learn from their mother to care for their father. When their father comes home from work, they are very affectionate with him. They refuse to eat the dishes that their mother makes for their father. Their father often says, "Your mother is not in good health, don't make her angry, and help her with more chores." They all learn from their father to care for their mother, not letting her work too hard. When their mother is asleep, they walk quietly so as not to disturb her rest.

In May of last year, one day, Liu Ruizhen was discussing with her husband whether or not to hire someone when she gave birth. Liu Ruizhen said, "Hiring someone will cost money, I think we should forget about it." Lao Zhao said, "Your health is not good, it's better to hire someone to help. I also don't want to take time off from work and delay production." While the two were discussing, the sons and daughters, who were standing by listening intently to their parents' conversation, looked at each other. Then, the eldest son said seriously, "When Mom gives birth to Mao Mao, we will take charge of the household chores." Ruizhen and Lao Zhao asked almost simultaneously in surprise, "You? How will you take charge?" Dong Sheng搶着 said, "I can light the stove, chop firewood, and do the cleaning..." The daughter, Xiaoyun, followed by saying, "I can cook, wash diapers, and take care of my younger siblings..." The matter was decided according to what the children said.

Liu Ruizhen returned home on the same day that she gave birth to her seventh child in the hospital. Her children really became the masters of the house, and she just lay in bed giving directions. For this birth, Liu Ruizhen only asked Xiaoyun to take two days off from school. On the night before Xiaoyun had to go to school, she steamed a basket of steamed buns for the whole family. The next morning, she and her brother cleaned the house before going to school. After the children went to school, Liu Ruizhen got up and went to the kitchen. Her fourth son, who was not yet eight years old, was learning to light the stove like his older sister!

In June, Liu Ruizhen was rated as a "Five-Good" Activist, and her family was rated as a "Five-Good" Family. She put the two certificates she received from the district together with the certificates her husband won at the construction site.

    刘瑞珍是个好妈妈
    本报记者  张碨
    刘瑞珍，这个三十多岁的家庭妇女，有七个孩子，最大的十四岁，小的才九个月。她丈夫老赵是长江大桥的电机工人，在工资改革以前，每月收入六十八元。全家九口人靠这点钱过日子，是够艰难的了，可是刘瑞珍精打细算，计划开支，自己又起早赶夜缝缝补补的，不仅不欠债，每月还储蓄两块钱。去年工资改革后，老赵升为工长，每月收入连施工津贴在内共九十四元。这九十四元对九口之家仍然不算宽裕，但她每月发薪后，先把米、面、油、盐等买齐，留下菜钱、房租、水电费、老赵的党费和工会会费等，再交一元或二元互助金（职工家属自动组织的），买四元有奖储蓄，最后剩下十元存到银行里作预备金。
    刘瑞珍从来不乱花一个钱，并且常对孩子们说：“爸爸劳动得来的钱很不容易，咱们大家都得节省，不要跟人家比吃穿。大衣服可以改成小衣服，破了的补补还能穿，谁没有穿的才添新的，不能每一个人都一齐添。她的话深深印在孩子的心里。十二岁的女儿小云有一件汗衫，肩头上已经破了个大洞，可还仍然穿着，舍不得丢。妈妈说：“这件衣服破了，别穿了。”小云说：“我在家里穿嘛。”妈妈一定让她脱下来，她只得脱下来了。一天，刘瑞珍从外边回来，看见小云坐在床上低着头缝什么，走近一看，原来她在补那件脱下来的汗衫。妈妈说：“别补了，不是不叫你穿了吗？”小云扭过身去，边缝边嘀咕着：“我现在不穿，冬天当内衣穿不行？”这件破了的衣服，小云又穿了一冬，最近，刘瑞珍才把它撕了做鞋衬布了。
    老三永升比较顽皮，又不大用功，到四年级还没入队，刘瑞珍对他特别操心。一天，他跟少先队员看电影回来，一个人坐着不吱声。刘瑞珍看见他不像平常那样蹦蹦跳跳的，便问他：“永升，你跟谁生气了？”“没生气，我看电影去了。”“那怎么不高兴呀？”“人家都有红领巾，就我没有。”刘瑞珍想趁机会诱导他谈出自己的缺点，自觉改正。她装着不懂的样子，对永升说：“哥哥姐姐也都有红领巾，我给你买一条好不好？”“买的不管事，要学校发的。”“那学校为什么发给别人，不发给你呢？”“老师说我上课爱讲话，功课不好。”“你上课光讲话，老师讲什么你当然没听见，那你的功课怎么会好呢？我看这毛病就出在你上课爱讲话上了。哥哥姐姐在小学三年级时，就挂上了红领巾，可你到四年级了还没有红领巾。以后你可要改啊！”永升看见妈妈那副关心又难过的神气，赶紧对妈妈说：“我再不顽皮了，我一定听老师和妈妈的话……”。“六一”儿童节那天，刘瑞珍正在厨房里忙着，忽然听见永升连喊带跳的跑回来，他一进门就说：“妈妈，我戴上红领巾了。”他得意的看看自己胸前的红领巾，又看看妈妈。刘瑞珍看着面前站着的孩子，孩子闪着两支大而愉快的眼睛，胖脸蛋红红的，配着胸前新挂上的红领巾，心想：“这孩子今天怎么特别漂亮啊！”
    刘瑞珍对自己的丈夫特别关心。平时刘瑞珍和孩子们吃白菜、豆腐、豆芽等素菜，但她总给老赵另外准备些鸡蛋，等老赵下班回来给他炒着吃。休假的时候，她也常陪着老赵带上孩子出去玩玩，两人有说有笑的像一对新婚夫妇。星期日，她常和老赵一起去买菜，别人问她：“你们连买菜也要一起去？”她不好意思地说：“我怕我买的菜不合他的口味。”
    孩子们看见妈妈这样关心爸爸，个个也都学着妈妈关心爸爸，爸爸下班回来，和爸爸亲热的不得了，妈妈给爸爸做的菜，他们谁也不吃。爸爸常说：“妈妈身体不好，你们可别惹她生气，还要多帮她做事。”他们又都学着爸爸关心妈妈，不叫妈妈太劳累了，妈妈睡着了就轻轻走动，不影响妈妈休息。
    去年5月，有一天，刘瑞珍正和丈夫商量生孩子请不请人的事儿。刘瑞珍开口就说：“请人又要花钱，我看算了吧。”老赵说：“你的身体不好，还是请个人来帮忙。我也省得请假耽误生产。”两人正在商量着，站在旁边眼鼓鼓地听着爸爸妈妈谈话的儿子女儿，互相望了望之后，大儿子便一本正经地说：“妈妈生毛毛，家里的事由我们掌握。”瑞珍和老赵几乎是同时地惊异地问道：“你们？你们怎么掌握呀？”东升抢着说：“我会生炉子、劈柴火、打扫清洁卫生……”女儿小云接着说：“我做饭、洗尿布，还能照顾弟妹……”事情就按孩子们说的定下了。
    刘瑞珍在医院里生下第七个孩子后，当天就回到家里。她的孩子们真成了家里的主人，她只是躺在床上当当指挥。刘瑞珍这次生孩子，只有小云向学校请了两天假。小云要上学的头天晚上，给全家人蒸了一笼馍，第二天一早，又和哥哥打扫好清洁卫生才上学去了。孩子们上学之后，刘瑞珍起床到厨房一看，没满八岁的儿子老四正学着姐姐的样子生炉子呢！
    6月，刘瑞珍被评为“五好”积极分子，她的家庭被评为“五好”家庭。她把从区上领回的两张奖状和她爱人在工地上获得的奖状贴在一起了。
