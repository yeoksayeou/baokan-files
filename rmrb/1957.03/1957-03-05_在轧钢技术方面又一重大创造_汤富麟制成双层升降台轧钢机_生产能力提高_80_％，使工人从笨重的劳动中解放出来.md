Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 4th - The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 Thin Plate Factory has officially produced its first batch of steel plates using a double-decker elevating table rolling mill. This rolling mill was developed by Tang Fulin, an engineer at the No. 1 Thin Plate Factory, with the assistance of Soviet experts, after more than four years of research.

Next to this unusual rolling mill with its double-decker elevating table, the reporter saw that while the steel billet on the upper elevating table was being rolled, the steel billet on the lower elevating table was being fed in; and while the steel billet on the lower elevating table was being rolled, the steel billet on the upper elevating table was being fed in. The red-hot steel billets came and went, the double-decker elevating table moved straight up and down, and in just a few seconds, two sets (a total of four pieces) of steel plates were rolled out. However, at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's No. 2 Thin Plate Factory, because they only have a single-decker elevating table rolling mill, they can only roll one set of steel plates at a time.

According to some steel rolling experts, this double-decker elevating table rolling mill, because it can roll two sets of steel plates simultaneously, will have a production capacity about 80% greater than that of a single-decker elevating table rolling mill. The successful creation of this double-decker elevating table rolling mill can not only increase steel plate production, but also liberate the steel rolling workers of the No. 1 Thin Plate Factory from heavy manual labor.

The emergence of the new double-decker elevating table rolling mill has aroused widespread interest. Li Songtang, the chief of the design department and chief engineer of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, said: The successful trial production of this new rolling mill is another major creation of Anshan Iron and Steel Company after Zhang Mingshan and others created the anti-encircling disk for rolling steel. Soviet experts at Anshan Iron and Steel Company believe that the successful creation of the double-decker elevating table rolling mill has opened up a new path in steel rolling technology and is of great significance not only to China but also to the world's steel rolling technology.

Beginning in 1953, Tang Fulin encountered many failures in the process of designing and installing this rolling mill. However, with the help of several Soviet experts and draftsman Tang Hongxiu, mechanical technician Li Chengxuan, technician Zhao Yongquan of the No. 2 Thin Plate Factory, chief mechanical engineer Wu Benlian, and others, he finally succeeded in creating it on February 28.

    在轧钢技术方面又一重大创造
    汤富麟制成双层升降台轧钢机
    生产能力提高80％，使工人从笨重的劳动中解放出来
    新华社鞍山4日电  鞍钢第一薄板厂运用一种双层升降台的轧钢机正式生产了第一批钢板。这种轧钢机是第一薄板厂的工程师汤富麟在苏联专家的帮助下，经过四年多时间，研究成功的。
    在这台奇怪的有双层升降台的轧钢机旁，记者看到当上层升降台的钢坯正在轧制的时候，下层升降台的钢坯就送过来了；当下层升降台的钢坯轧制的时候，上层升降台的钢坯又送过来了，只见火红的钢坯一来一往，双层升降台直上直下，不过几秒钟的时间，二组（共四块）钢板就轧制出来。可是在鞍钢第二薄板厂，因为只是单层升降台的轧钢机，一次只能轧制一组钢板。
    据一些轧钢专家们估计，这台双层升降台的轧钢机，因为能同时轧制两组钢板，它的生产能力将比单层升降台的轧钢机要大80％左右。这台双层升降台的轧钢机的创制成功，除可以增加钢板外，并且使第一薄板厂的轧钢工人从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来。
    新型的双层升降台的轧钢机的出现，引起了人们的广泛兴趣。鞍钢设计处处长、总工程师李松堂说：这台新轧钢机的试制成功，是鞍钢继张明山等创造轧钢反围盘之后，又一重大的创造。在鞍钢的苏联专家认为，双层升降台轧钢机的创造成功给轧钢技术开辟了新的道路，不仅对中国，而且对世界的轧钢技术方面都有重大意义。
    从1953年开始，汤富麟从设计到安装这台轧钢机的过程中，遭受过好多次的失败。但是在好几位苏联专家和制图员汤洪秀、机械技师李承宣、第二薄板厂技术员赵永泉、总机械师工程师吴本廉等帮助下，终于在2月28日创造成功。
