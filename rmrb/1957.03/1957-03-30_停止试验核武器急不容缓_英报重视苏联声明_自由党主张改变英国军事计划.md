Xinhua News Agency, London, March 29th: The Soviet government's statement expressing its willingness to conclude an agreement on a temporary cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests has become a central focus of attention for British newspapers these past two days.

The "Times" said yesterday that in July of last year, the then Prime Minister Eden said that the British government was willing to discuss the issue of limiting hydrogen bomb tests separately, but now the government has completely dismissed the idea of limiting tests.

The "Daily Herald" strongly criticized Macmillan's attitude when he returned to London the day before yesterday, saying that if an agreement could not be reached with the Soviet Union on "establishing a system to control tests," Britain would insist on hydrogen bomb tests. The newspaper said that the Soviet Union has already put forward suggestions, how can Macmillan still say that the Soviet Union has shortcomings in control?

The day before yesterday, the "News Chronicle" published the news of the Soviet statement with a banner headline: "Russia Says - We Stop Now." The newspaper's commentator, Forrest, wrote that the Soviet proposal "solves the urgent issue of testing, bypassing the endless talk about disarmament. This is a new initiative and a real challenge to the West."

At the same time, some right-wing newspapers believe that the British government should insist on hydrogen bomb tests.

Xinhua News Agency, London, March 29th: The British Liberal Party Parliamentary Group issued a statement on the evening of March 28, calling for a halt to atomic weapons testing.

The Liberal Party Parliamentary Group believes that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization does not need to be equipped with atomic or nuclear weapons. And Britain "should abandon the independent manufacture of nuclear weapons" and should "limit itself to contributing to the nuclear program of the free world mainly through research."

The statement also broadly commented on Britain's "defense" plans. It believes that "the overall approach to defense should be to provide conventional weapons to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and maintain a mobile reserve force," while "abandoning plans to maintain army bases in the Far East and the Middle East (except Singapore)." Thus, only a conventional army of between 100,000 and 175,000 men is needed. The air force will "largely focus on transporting mobile forces, police activities, and contributing to the European army," while the navy will play a smaller role.

### 停止试验核武器急不容缓　英报重视苏联声明　自由党主张改变英国军事计划

　　停止试验核武器急不容缓
　　英报重视苏联声明
　　自由党主张改变英国军事计划
    据新华社29日讯  伦敦消息：苏联政府声明愿意缔结一项暂时停止原子和氢武器试验的协定，成为这两天英国报纸注意的一个中心。
    “泰晤士报”昨天说，在去年7月时，当时的首相艾登说过，英国政府愿意单独讨论限制氢弹试验问题，而现在政府却已经把限制试验的想法一笔勾消。
    “每日先驱报”今天强烈批评麦克米伦前天回到伦敦时所表示的态度，他说，如果不能就“订立一个制度来控制试验”问题同苏联达成协议，英国便要坚持氢弹试验。报纸说，苏联已经提出了建议，麦克米伦还能说是苏联没有控制的缺点吗？
    前天，“新闻纪事报”在刊登苏联声明的消息时加上了通栏的大字标题：“俄国说——我们现在就停止”。这家报纸的评论员福莱斯特写道，苏联建议“解决关于试验这个迫切的问题，避开了关于裁军的漫无止境的谈话，这是一个新的倡议，是对西方真正的挑战”。
    同时，也有一些右派报纸认为英国政府应当坚持氢弹试验。
    据新华社29日讯  伦敦消息：英国自由党议会党团3月28日晚上发表声明，要求停止原子核试验。
    自由党议会党团认为，北大西洋公约组织并不需要用原子核武器或者原子武器装备起来”。而英国则“应该放弃单独地制造原子核武器”，它应该“仅仅限于主要通过研究对自由世界的原子核计划作出贡献”。
    声明还对英国的“防御”计划广泛地提出意见。它认为，“防御的总的方式应该是向北大西洋公约组织提供常规武器，并且维持一支机动的预备部队”，同时“放弃在远东和中东保持陆军基地的打算（新加坡除外）。这样，就只需要一支人数在十万到十七万五千人之间的常规陆军，空军则“在很大程度上集中在运送机动部队、警察活动和向欧洲军作出贡献方面”，而海军的作用将比较小。
