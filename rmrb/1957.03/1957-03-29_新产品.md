　　Six Hundred Millimeter Rolling Mill
    This newspaper reports Our country's first self-made six hundred millimeter rolling mill has been manufactured at the Dalian Steel Plant and has undergone trial production.
    The design of this rolling mill was based on the designs of rolling mills from other factories, making full use of existing equipment and domestically produced materials.
    In the past, the factory's lack of a larger billet mill affected the quality of steel, and user departments raised many concerns. The successful trial production of this rolling mill has created favorable conditions for improving steel quality and increasing output.
    This machine will be officially put into production in the second quarter.
    Porcelain Water Pipes
    This newspaper reports The Pingxiang Porcelain Factory has recently trial-produced a type of "porcelain water pipe." After testing, it has been proven that this water pipe is not only suitable for construction projects, but also can be used as a drain in highway engineering. The cost is much lower than that of cast iron water pipes.
    According to the needs of construction projects, galvanized iron and cast iron water pipes should be able to withstand a water pressure of three kilograms, with a testing requirement of six kilograms; the test results of porcelain water pipes showed that they could withstand water pressure of more than seven kilograms, and the situation remained good for nine consecutive hours, until the water pressure was increased to twenty-five kilograms, at which point the porcelain pipes ruptured. In terms of strength testing, the maximum load (compressive strength) was 2,050 kilograms, and the maximum bending resistance was 220 kilograms. The performance in terms of strength met all requirements.
    The Pingxiang Porcelain Factory is now continuing to work on trial production of elbows, tees, reducing couplings and other parts for water pipe joints. Once the machinery and equipment issues are resolved, they will be officially put into mass production.
　　Important Equipment on Paper Machines
    Xinhua News Agency reports An important piece of equipment on paper machines—the honeycomb vacuum couch roll—has recently been successfully manufactured at the joint state-private Hua Feng Paper Mill and has been installed on a paper machine for use, with good results.
    This vacuum couch roll uses vacuum suction to press out the water in the paper web, which can prevent the fibers in the paper web from being damaged and improve the uniformity of the paper web. Various paper defects caused by the original use of upper and lower couch rolls can be eliminated.
    This vacuum couch roll was manufactured in imitation of a product from the German Democratic Republic.

　  六百米厘的轧钢机
    本报讯  我国自制的第一台六百米厘的轧钢机已在大连钢铁厂制成，并进行了试生产。
    设计这台轧钢机是参照其它厂轧钢机的设计，充分利用旧有设备和国产材料制成的。
    过去，这个厂由于没有较大的开胚机而影响了钢材的质量，利用部门提出了不少的意见。这台轧钢机试制成功，给提高钢材质量和增加产量创造了良好的条件。
    这个机器将在第二季度正式投入生产。
    瓷质水管
    本报讯  萍乡瓷厂最近试制成一种“瓷质水管”。经鉴定证明，这种水管不仅适用于建筑工程，而且可以做公路工程中的下水道。成本比生铁水管低廉得多。
    按照建筑工程上使用的需要，白铁及生铁自来水管，要能耐三公斤的水压，试验时的要求为六公斤；而瓷质水管试验结果，耐水压力在七公斤以上，并且在持续九小时内情况良好，直至将水压增加到二十五公斤时，瓷管才破裂。在强度试验方面，最大荷重（抗压力）为二千零五十公斤，最大抗弯为二百二十公斤，强力方面的性能全部合乎要求。
    现在萍乡瓷厂正继续着手对水管接头用的弯管、三通、大小头等零件的试制，俟机器设备问题获得解决后，即将大量正式投入生产。
　  造纸机上的重要设备
    据新华社讯  造纸机上的重要设备——蜂巢式真空伏辊，最近在公私合营华丰造纸厂制造成功，并且已经安装在造纸机上使用，效果很好。
    这种真空伏辊利用真空吸力把纸页中的水份压出，能使纸页中的纤维不受破坏，纸页的匀度也能提高，原来用上下伏辊所引起的各种纸病都能消除。
    这种真空伏辊是仿照德意志民主共和国的产品制造的。
