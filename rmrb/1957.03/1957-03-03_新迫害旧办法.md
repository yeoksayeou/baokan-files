    New Persecution, Old Methods
    On February 26th, the U.S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee subpoenaed American Communist Party leader Dennis, demanding that he reveal all the details of the recently held American Communist Party Congress. Senator Hruska, who presided over the hearing, ruled that Dennis must answer all questions but was not allowed to read his statement to the committee.
    In response to the questioning, Dennis pointed out that the committee's investigation was a violation of the U.S. Constitution. In the portion of his statement that he was forbidden to read, he emphasized that the real threats to the security and democracy of the United States were the oil trusts' efforts to drag the American people into colonialist adventures in the Middle East and Korean War-style provocations, the brutal attacks and persecutions against millions of Black people in the South, and the attempts to abolish constitutional amendments guaranteeing democratic rights. If the committee was truly concerned about the security of the United States, these were the dangers they should be addressing.
    During the interrogation, the committee's legal counsel exhausted every means to trap Dennis into admitting that the American Communist Party received so-called "instructions" from abroad. They wanted him to reveal what "instructions" he had received from sources such as congratulatory messages from leaders of communist parties in other countries to the American Communist Party Congress and from American Communist Party leaders who had been unjustly exiled abroad by the U.S. government. Dennis replied that these questions were "absurd and ridiculous." This is probably the most appropriate description that could be found for the committee's interrogation.
    The purpose of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee in organizing this subpoena was to accuse the American Communist Party of engaging in "un-American activities" in order to take further judicial persecution against it and isolate it from the masses. This is the old method that the American ruling group has consistently adopted against the American progressive forces over the years since the war. For many years, they have subpoenaed many well-known American peace, democracy, progressive figures and labor, Black leaders; imprisoned many American Communist Party leaders, staff members, and other social activists who advocated peace, democracy, and progress, and deported or electrocuted others; and put the black label of "engaging in subversive activities" on all people's organizations that did not conform to their interests. The Foley Square trial and the Rosenberg case have become dark markers in American history. The American reactionaries, using the vast propaganda network monopolized in their hands, the ubiquitous secret service agencies, and the huge state apparatus, have taken various methods to try to ideologically and organizationally destroy the American peace, democracy, and progressive forces. Endless persecution and sabotage have caused great difficulties and losses to the American democratic and progressive forces. The American Communist Party, standing at the forefront of the peace, democracy, and progressive forces, has suffered the brunt of the attack. But the American Communist Party has not been destroyed. It is still bravely carrying out the struggle against the American reactionary offensive. At the National Congress of the American Communist Party, although there were internal divisions and struggles, the congress still insisted on maintaining the party's name and unity. It is no accident that American reactionaries have now begun a new round of judicial persecution. They are clearly trying to further strike at this long-tested vanguard of the American democratic and progressive forces at a time when the American Communist Party is consolidating the unity of its ranks. This is necessary for them to further strike at the American peace forces and the working class, strengthen domestic fascist rule, and intensify foreign colonial expansion, preparing for new wars of aggression. When American oil tycoon Rockefeller directly instructs the American President on how to grasp and use American dollar diplomacy to more effectively carry out overseas expansion for American monopoly capital, the congressional committee responsible for American security attacks the American Communist Party, attempting to accuse it of "un-American activities." This stark contrast illustrates how different the American ruling group's concept of "America" is from the American people's America, and also shows which meaning of America the current American state apparatus and legislative bodies serve. Indeed, the American Communist Party has not served the interests of monopoly capital as faithfully as the American government, and has consistently fought against the rule of monopoly capital, but it is wholeheartedly fighting for the interests of the real America, the American people, and the American nation. It opposes war and colonial expansion policies, opposes racial discrimination and fascism, opposes the increasing attacks of monopoly capital on the working people; it advocates international peace and friendship, advocates people's democracy and equal rights for Black people, and advocates the establishment of a society without exploitation and oppression by monopoly capital. Is it not precisely because of these activities of the American Communist Party, which truly represent the interests of the American nation and people, that the American reactionaries hate it to the bone and are determined to pull out this thorn in their side?
    The American reactionaries will never relax their persecution of the democratic and progressive forces, and there should be no illusions in this regard. However, the times are advancing, and the people are becoming increasingly aware. The day will come when the anti-communist haze that shrouds the United States will be dispelled, and the people will make the final judgment: those who are truly patriotic are the communists who now appear to be relatively isolated and persecuted, while those who are now perched on the interrogation seat, baring their fangs and claws, have committed serious crimes against the people for serving as slaves of American monopoly capital.

    新迫害旧办法
    2月26日，美国参议院国内安全小组委员会传讯美国共产党领袖丹尼斯，要他谈出新近举行的美国共产党代表大会的全部情况。审问主持人参议员赫鲁斯卡裁决要丹尼斯回答一切问题，却不许丹尼斯在委员会上读完他的声明。
    丹尼斯在答复讯问时指出委员会组织的这种调查是违反美国宪法的。在被禁止宣读的声明部分，丹尼斯强调指出，目前真正威胁着美国的安全和民主的，是石油托辣斯竭力要把美国人民拖进在中东的殖民主义冒险和朝鲜战争式的挑衅，是对南方数百万黑人的凶残的进攻和迫害，是有人正企图取消宪法关于保障民主权利的修正案。委员会要是真正关心美国的安全，这些才是他们真正应当挺身加以应付的危险。
    在讯问中间，委员会的法律顾问用尽各种办法想使丹尼斯落入圈套，承认有所谓外国给美国共产党的“指示”。他们要他说出从诸如别国共产党领袖给美国共产党大会的贺电和被美国政府以莫须有的罪名放逐在国外的美国共产党领袖那里得到过什么这一类的“指示”。丹尼斯在回答时说，这些问题是“荒谬可笑的”。这大概是能够找得出来的最适合于委员会这种讯问的形容辞了。
    参议院国内安全小组委员会组织这次传讯的目的，就是想给美国共产党加上一个从事“非美国活动”的罪名，以便对它采取进一步的司法迫害，并使它从群众中孤立起来。这是战后历年来美国统治集团对美国进步力量一贯采用的老办法。多年以来他们传审了许多知名的美国和平民主进步人士和劳工、黑人的领袖；把许多美国共产党的领袖、工作人员和其他主张和平民主进步的社会活动家投入监狱，并把另外一些驱逐出境或电刑处死；给所有不合乎他们利益的人民团体挂上“从事颠复性活动”的黑牌子。福莱广场的审判和罗森堡案件已经成为美国历史上黑暗的表记。美国反动派运用垄断在他们手里的广布的宣传网、无孔不入的特务机关和庞大的国家机器，采取各种方法，力图从思想上和组织上摧毁美国和平民主进步的力量。无穷的迫害和破坏使美国民主进步力量遭到了巨大的困难和不少的损失。而站在和平民主进步力量最前列的美国共产党遭受了首当其冲的打击。但是美国共产党并没有被摧毁。它仍然勇敢地进行着反对美国反动进攻的斗争。在美国共产党全国代表大会上，虽然发生了党内的分歧和斗争，但是这次代表大会仍坚持维护党的名称和团结。美国反动派在这个时候又来开始一次新的司法迫害，这不是偶然的。他们显然是要在美国共产党巩固自己队伍的团结的时候来进一步打击美国民主进步力量的这个久经锻炼的先锋队。这对于他们进一步打击美国和平民主力量和工人阶级，加强国内法西斯统治和加紧对外的殖民扩张，准备新的侵略战争是必要的。当着美国石油大王洛克菲勒直接向美国总统具体指示应当如何来掌握和运用美国的金元外交，更有效地为美国垄断资本进行海外扩张的时候，负责美国安全问题的国会委员会却对美国共产党进行攻击，企图给它加上“非美国活动”的罪名，这一显明对照说明美国统治集团的“美国”和美国人民的美国这个观念如何不同，也说明美国现在的国家机器和立法机关是服务于那一种意义的美国。的确，美国共产党没有像美国政府那样忠实地服务于垄断资本的利益，而且一贯为反对垄断资本的统治而进行斗争，但是它却是忠心耿耿地为着真正的美国、美国人民、美国民族的利益而奋斗不懈。它反对战争和殖民扩张政策，反对种族歧视和法西斯化，反对垄断资本对劳动人民日益加甚的进攻；它主张国际和平和友好，主张人民民主和黑人的平等权利，主张建立没有垄断资本剥削和压迫的社会。难道不正是因为美国共产党的这些真正代表美国民族和人民利益的活动，才使得美国反动派恨之入骨，而一心要拔掉这个眼中钉吗？
    美国反动派对民主进步力量的迫害是绝不会放松的，在这方面不能有任何幻想。但是，时代在前进，人民在日益觉醒。这样的日子是要到来的，那时，笼罩着美国的反共阴霾会被驱散，人民将会作出最后的审判：真正爱国的是现在看起来还是比较孤单和备受迫害的共产党人，而那些现在高踞在审问席上张牙舞爪的人们，由于他们充当美国垄断资本的奴仆而犯了反人民的严重罪行。
