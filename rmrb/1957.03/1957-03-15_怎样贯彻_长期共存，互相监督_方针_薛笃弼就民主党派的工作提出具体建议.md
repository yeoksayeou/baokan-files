I was excited and encouraged by Chairman Mao's instructions at the Supreme State Conference and Premier Zhou Enlai's "Report on Visits to Eleven Asian and European Countries," and I wholeheartedly support them. I also fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Explanation of Several Issues Concerning the Proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan," Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC," Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech "On the Current Market Situation and This Year's Increase Production and Practice Economy," and Vice Chairman Dong Biwu's speech "On Several Issues Concerning Political and Legal Work."

Now I would like to talk about my superficial understanding of the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," and I welcome your comments.

Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" between the Communist Party and the democratic parties last year, members of the democratic parties have been encouraged and inspired and have expressed their sincere admiration for the Communist Party's great spirit of selflessness and open-mindedness. As a member of a democratic party, I have also gained a sense of infinite honor and political responsibility.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi, in his political report to the "Eighth National Congress," and Minister Li Weihan, in his speech to the "Eighth National Congress," gave profound explanations of the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." The "Eighth National Congress" also made a clear decision, emphasizing the political freedom and organizational independence of democratic parties within the scope of the rights and obligations conferred by the Constitution, and criticizing certain party members for their past lack of attention to non-party people. For the democratic parties, it not only put forward the social foundation and important role of long-term coexistence, but also gave meticulous care, earnest expectations, and frank and open indications of the bright and splendid road ahead for the democratic parties. Chairman Mao recently gave clear and cordial instructions on this great policy at the Supreme State Conference. We believe that the key today is no longer the theoretical basis of long-term coexistence, but how the democratic parties and the Communist Party can share the same breath and destiny and work better and play a greater role in the great leap forward of socialism. At the same time, it is not a question of whether the democratic parties should supervise the Communist Party, but how the democratic parties can share the concerns and labors of the Communist Party and, under the leadership of the Communist Party, carry out mutual supervision and work together to complete the great cause of socialist construction.

Clearly Recognize Two Basic Issues

Based on the above understanding, I, like many comrades, feel that the members of the democratic parties must first clarify the relationship between leadership and being led and the principles and policies of unity and struggle.

1. The relationship between leadership and being led:

Our motherland's ability to be so strong today is entirely due to the wise and correct leadership of the Communist Party, which no one can deny. In the future, in order to consolidate the victories that have been achieved, to ensure the completion of the great socialist construction and socialist transformation that are underway, to oppose enemies at home and abroad and liberate Taiwan, to strengthen the unity of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp, and to defend world peace, historical experience tells us that all this must rely on the strong leadership of the Communist Party. Because of this, the relationship between the Communist Party and the democratic parties cannot be understood as being equally divided, each with its own merits and inviolable, thereby negating the leadership of the Communist Party and forgetting that the People's Democratic United Front was formed due to the leadership of the working class. At the same time, it does not conform to the spirit of the sacred provision of Article 1 of the Constitution, "The People's Republic of China is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants." Therefore, the democratic parties must resolutely accept the leadership of the Communist Party in politics, which is not allowed to have any ambiguity or doubt.

2. The policy of unity and struggle:

If the democratic parties are to play the greatest role in socialist construction and socialist transformation, and to be a capable assistant to the Communist Party, each member needs to follow the spirit of the seventh of the seven guidelines in the General Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, not only on a voluntary basis, but also on a necessary basis, "to study the theory of Marxism-Leninism, actively study the policies of the state, improve their political level, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and strive to carry out ideological remolding." Otherwise, it will not be possible to correctly carry out the work of uniting, educating, and transforming the class and stratum they represent—that is, the masses they are connected with—as society develops. Because this work is essentially a struggle between socialist ideology and capitalist ideology. Carrying out education and transformation is also a struggle on the ideological front. If one's own ideology has not been transformed and one's position and viewpoint are not stable, how can one carry out education and transformation work on others? However, the work of education and transformation must be carried out on the basis of unity. Therefore, it is necessary to firmly grasp the correct policy of unity and struggle. If there is only unity and no education and transformation, it will inevitably lead to the direction of unprincipled peaceful coexistence. Conversely, if only education and transformation are carried out without paying attention to unity, the effect of education and transformation will inevitably not be achieved. These two are indispensable.

Work that Should Be Done Now

On the basis of clarifying the above two basic issues, what work should the democratic parties do? At this stage, I think:

First, it is necessary to do a good job of contacting the social masses. Taking the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (民革) as an example, after a year of efforts, it has contacted more than 2,400 people from the social masses. In a large city like Shanghai, the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang should contact far more people than this number. Therefore, it is necessary to further expand the scope of contact, and at the same time, while contacting, actively do a good job of education and transformation, so that the people who are contacted can learn better.

Second, it is necessary to do a good job of educating members. Still taking the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang as an example, for the needs of work, under the policy of "combining development and consolidation," the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang has absorbed more than 1,200 new members in the past year. The team has expanded, but the ideas brought into the party are more complex. How to enable all members to meet the political requirements of our party and complete the tasks assigned by the party requires organized, planned, and especially patient education of members, and enables them to play a backbone and leading role in the education and transformation of the social masses they contact. There are also many members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang who have specialized skills that have not been properly arranged, which is also an issue that should be paid attention to.

Third, it is necessary to do a good job of reflecting the opinions of the masses. In the past few years, in every major measure of the Party and the government, and in the major developments of the domestic and international situation, the members of the democratic parties and the masses they are connected with do not have absolutely no opinions, due to the different angles and levels of looking at problems. Some of these opinions are correct, and some are wrong. Our democratic parties should widely collect the opinions of the masses, conduct research and analysis, and reflect them to the Party and the government through leadership, or make specific suggestions, knowing everything and saying everything, so that the Party and the government can refer to them when implementing policies. This is the best help for the Party from the democratic parties, and it is also the best supervision.

Finally, it is necessary to do a good job of peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Since the government issued the call for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, more and more people within the Chiang Kai-shek group have responded to this call. We believe that Taiwan will inevitably be liberated, but our democratic parties have not done enough in this work. Therefore, we must do this work more actively, more actively, and more diversely. Here I would like to make an immature suggestion: In order to promote the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, could we organize a liaison association of family members of Taiwanese military and political personnel on the mainland under the leadership of the local CPPCC, so as to closely connect and promote the work.

The above four points may be old sayings, but precisely because they are old sayings, we should work harder to do better.

I am a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, and encouraged by the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," I am always thinking about how I should fulfill my responsibility as a member of a democratic party. However, because I have not studied enough, my political awareness is not high, and I have not made any contribution to the Party, I feel very ashamed. In order to do a good job, I am learning Marxist-Leninist philosophy like an elementary school student who is just learning to read, and at the same time I am learning current affairs policies, hoping to gradually improve my political and ideological level, and under the leadership of the Party, contribute my strength to the four tasks mentioned above.

In nearly ten months of studying Marxist-Leninist philosophy, I have only slightly understood the basics of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, but I have already deeply felt that in order for us to correctly understand the world, study, analyze and deal with problems, distinguish between right and wrong, distinguish between enemies and ourselves, make fewer mistakes, and avoid taking wrong paths, this is indeed a great science that must be learned, and the more you study it, the more you feel that in-depth study is necessary. I must continue to persist in learning diligently and honestly, learning, learning again, hoping to learn to master and apply the position, viewpoints and methods of Marxism-Leninism, and strive to be able to meet the political requirements of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" in thought and action. I sincerely hope that comrades will give me guidance and help at any time. (Attached picture)

### 怎样贯彻“长期共存，互相监督”方针  薛笃弼就民主党派的工作提出具体建议

    怎样贯彻“长期共存，互相监督”方针
    薛笃弼就民主党派的工作提出具体建议
    我听了毛主席在最高国务会议上的指示和周恩来总理“关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告”，使我兴奋，使我鼓舞，我完全衷心拥护。李富春副总理“关于第二个五年计划建议的若干问题的说明”，陈叔通副主席“政协第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告”，陈云副总理“就目前的市场状况和今年的增产节约问题”的发言，和董必武副主席“有关政法工作的几个问题”的发言。我都完全同意。
    现在谈一谈我对“长期共存互相监督”的方针的一点肤浅的体会，请各位指教。
    自从去年中共中央提出了共产党和各民主党派“长期共存互相监督”的方针以来，民主党派成员无不感到鼓舞和振奋，对于共产党大公无私虚怀若谷的伟大精神，表示衷心的敬佩。我作为一个民主党派成员，也增加了无限的光荣感和政治责任感。
    刘少奇委员长在“八大”政治报告中，李维汉部长在“八大”发言中，都就“长期共存互相监督”的方针，作了深刻的阐明，“八大”并作出了明确的决定，强调民主党派在宪法赋予的权利义务范围内的政治自由和组织独立，批评了某些党员对党外人士过去不够重视的缺点，而对于民主党派，不惟提出了长期共存的社会基础及其重要作用，并且关怀备至，期望殷切，开诚布公地指出了民主党派今后所走的光明灿烂的道路，毛主席日前在最高国务会议上，又就这个伟大的方针，给了明白而亲切的指示。我们认为今天的关键所在，已不是长期共存的理论根据问题，而是各民主党派与共产党如何同呼吸、共命运，在社会主义大踏步的前进中工作得更好、发挥作用更大的问题。同时，也不是民主党派对共产党应否监督的问题，而是民主党派如何与共产党分忧分劳，以及在共产党领导下怎样进行互相监督，共同努力完成社会主义建设大业的问题。
    明确认识两个基本问题
    基于以上的认识，我和许多同志一样，觉得目前民主党派成员的思想上，首先要明确领导与被领导的关系和有团结有斗争的原则性和政策性。
    一、领导与被领导的关系：
    我们祖国能够有今天的强大，完全是由于共产党英明正确的领导，这是没有任何人能够否认的。今后为了巩固已经取得的胜利成果，为了保证完成正在进行中的伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，为了反对国内外敌人和解放台湾的斗争，为了加强和平、民主社会主义阵营的团结，捍卫世界持久和平，历史经验告诉我们，这都必须依靠共产党的坚强领导。正因为这样，就不能把共产党与民主党派之间的相互关系，理解为分庭抗礼，各有千秋，不相侵犯，从而否定了共产党的领导，忘却了人民民主统一战线是由于有了工人阶级的领导而形成的。同时也不符合宪法第一条“中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家”这一神圣规定的精神。因此，民主党派在政治上必须坚决接受共产党的领导，这是不容许有任何含糊和怀疑的。
    二、有团结有斗争的政策：
    民主党派要在社会主义建设和社会主义改造中发挥最大的作用，要作一个共产党的得力助手，这就需要每个成员遵照中国人民政治协商会议章程总纲七项准则第七项所指示的精神，不但要在自愿的基础上，还应进一步在必需的基础上“学习马克思列宁主义的理论，积极学习国家的政策，提高政治水平，展开批评和自我批评，努力进行思想改造。”不如此，就不能随着社会发展向其所代表的阶级、阶层——即所联系的群众正确地进行团结、教育、改造的工作。因为这一工作，实质上就是社会主义思想与资本主义思想的斗争。进行教育、改造也就是思想战线上的斗争，如果自己的思想都没有改造，立场观点不稳，又如何去向别人进行教育改造工作呢？但是教育、改造的工作，是要在团结的基础上进行的。因此，必须紧紧掌握有团结有斗争的这一个正确方针。如果只有团结，而不去教育改造，必然会迷失到无原则的和平相处的方向去。反之，如果只教育、改造，而不注意团结，又必然不会收到教育、改造的效果，这两者是不可偏废的。
    目前应做好的工作
    民主党派在以上两个基本问题明确的基础上，应该做好那几项工作呢？就现阶段说，我以为：
    首先，是要做好联系社会群众的工作。以上海民革为例，经过一年来的努力，已经联系了社会群众二千四百余人，像上海这样大的城市，民革应该联系的社会人士，决不止此数。因此，就必须更进一步扩大联系面，同时还要一边联系，一边积极地做好教育改造工作，使被联系的人士，都能学习得更好。
    其次，是要做好成员的教育工作。仍以上海民革为例，为了工作需要，在“发展与巩固相结合”的方针下，一年来上海民革已吸收了新成员一千二百余人。队伍是扩大了，但是带进党内来的思想是比较复杂的。如何能够使所有成员符合我们党的政治要求，完成党所交给的任务，这就必须有组织、有计划、特别是要有耐心地做好成员的教育工作，并使他们在教育改造被联系的社会人士中发挥骨干作用和带头作用。民革成员中还有不少学有专长的人，未得到适当的安排，这也是一个应当加以注意的问题。
    再其次，是要做好反映群众意见的工作。几年来在党和政府的每一重大措施中，在国内外形势的重大发展中，民主党派的成员和所联系的群众，由于看问题的角度和水平不同，并不是完全没有意见的。这些意见有的是正确的，有的是错误的，我们民主党派应该广泛地搜集群众意见，进行研究分析，通过领导向党和政府反映，或者作出具体建议，知无不言，言无不尽，以供党和政府在执行政策时的参考。这就是民主党派对党的最好的帮助，也就是最好的监督。
    最后，是要做好和平解放台湾的工作。自政府发出和平解放台湾的号召以来，蒋介石集团内部已有越来越多的人们响应这个号召，我们相信台湾是必然能够得到解放的，可是我们民主党派对于这一工作还做得不够。因此，我们必须更主动更积极更多样化地把这一工作做好。在这里我想提出一个不成熟的建议，为了促进和平解放台湾，可否在各地方政协领导之下组织台湾军政人员在大陆的家属联谊会，以便密切联系，推动工作。
    以上四点，可能是老生常谈，但是正惟其是老生常谈，就值得我们加倍努力，才能做得更好。
    我是民革成员之一，为“长期共存互相监督”的方针所鼓舞，无时不想到自己应该怎样尽到民主党派成员的一分责任。但是，因为学习不够，政治觉悟不高，对党没有什么贡献，很觉惭愧。为了做好工作，我正在像初学识字的小学生一样，学习马列主义哲学，同时学习时事政策，希望能够逐步提高我的政治思想水平，在党的领导下，对前面所谈的四项工作，贡献出我的力量。
    我在将近十个月的马列主义哲学学习中，对于辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，才略略地懂得了一点门径，但是已经深深地感觉到为了使我们正确地认识世界，研究分析和处理问题，明辨是非，分清敌我，少犯错误，少走错路，这的确是一门必须学习的伟大的科学，而且越钻研越觉得非深入学习不可。我必须继续坚持不懈地老老实实地学习，学习，再学习，期能学会掌握和运用马列主义的立场、观点和方法，力求在思想上、在行动上，能够符合“长期共存互相监督”的政治要求。我万分诚恳地希望同志们随时给我以指教和帮助。（附图片）
