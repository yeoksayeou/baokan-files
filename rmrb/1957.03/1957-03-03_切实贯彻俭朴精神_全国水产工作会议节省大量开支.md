    Earnestly Implement the Spirit of Thrift
    National Aquatic Products Work Conference Saves a Lot of Expenses

    (Our report) This newspaper reports that the Ministry of Aquatic Products convened the National Aquatic Products Work Conference in February, with a total of 236 participants. This conference implemented the principle of thrift, saving the state over 12,100 yuan in conference expenses, accounting for 70% of the original budget.

    They first merged conferences, combining the National Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Managers Conference, originally scheduled for the end of February, with the National Aquatic Products Work Conference. This not only saved representatives from various regions time and travel expenses to Beijing but also saved 5,285 yuan from the supply and marketing managers conference budget.

    The conference duration was shortened from the original 15 days to 10 days. The number of participants was reduced, with quotas set for representatives from various regions. Hotel rooms were not rented; instead, some office space was vacated for representatives to stay in. The Minister and Vice Ministers took the lead, with three ministers working in one office. Other offices were vacated, with one-third of the rooms provided for representatives to stay in. This saved 4,375 yuan in hotel rental fees.

    Regarding food subsidies, daily food expenses were limited to one yuan per person, with a 50% food subsidy for representatives from other regions. Central units and personnel from the ministry attending and sitting in on the conference did not receive food subsidies, saving 960 yuan. Large conference group meetings did not rent auditoriums but were instead held in offices or dining halls, saving 510 yuan in rental fees. Because the representatives' accommodations, dining hall, and meeting venues were all in one place, transportation costs were reduced by approximately 1,200 yuan. The conference did not hold banquets or provide recreational activities or tea, saving miscellaneous expenses of approximately 180 yuan. To enrich the representatives' lives, the ministry utilized its routine cultural and recreational activities, allowing representatives to watch movies and attend dances.

    The success of the National Aquatic Products Work Conference in saving money was achieved under the correct guidance of the leadership and with the support of cadres and the masses. This spirit of thrift made a great impression on the representatives from various regions. Some representatives said, "This central conference truly implemented the spirit of thrift." More representatives expressed that future conferences in various regions should be held in this way. (Zhong Qiao)

    切实贯彻俭朴精神
    全国水产工作会议节省大量开支
    本报讯  水产部在2月份召开了全国水产工作会议，参加会议的总人数为二百三十六人。这次会议贯彻执行了节约原则，为国家节省了会议开支一万二千一百多元，占原预算的70％。
    他们首先合并召开会议，把原计划在2月底召开的全国水产供销经理会议合并在全国水产工作会议一起开，这不但节省各地代表来京开会的时间与旅差费用，也节约了供销经理会议的预算五千二百八十五元。
    缩短会议日期，原定会期十五天，改为十天。精减参加人数，限定各地代表名额。不租旅馆房间，腾出一部分办公室供代表住宿，首先由部长、副部长带头，三位部长在一室办公。其他办公室腾出三分之一的房间给代表住。这样节省了租赁旅馆费用四千三百七十五元。
    伙食补贴方面，每天每人伙食费限定一元，外地代表伙食补助50％。中央各单位及本部出席和列席人员均不予伙食补贴，可节省支出九百六十元。大会小组会都不租用礼堂，改在办公室或饭厅开会，节省租费五百一十元。因为开会的代表住宿、饭厅、会场都在一起，节省了交通车费的开支约一千二百元。会议不聚餐、不招待游园和烟茶，节省杂费支出约一百八十元。为了调剂代表的生活，该部利用部内例行的文娱活动，使代表看到了电影，参加了舞会。
    这次全国水产工作会议的节约成绩是在领导的正确指导和干部、群众的支持下胜利实现的。这种节约精神给各地来京代表影响很大，有的代表说“中央这次开会真正贯彻了节约精神”。更多的代表表示各地的会议今后也应该这样开。 （仲翘）
