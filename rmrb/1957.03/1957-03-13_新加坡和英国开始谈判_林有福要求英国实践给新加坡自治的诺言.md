Xinhua News Agency, London, March 12th: Singapore and Britain began negotiations in London on March 11th to discuss Singapore's implementation of internal self-government within the Commonwealth.

    Lim Yew Hock, the Chief Minister and head of the Singapore delegation, demanded at the opening ceremony of the negotiations that the British government fulfill its previous promise to grant Singapore autonomy. Lim Yew Hock said, "The people of Singapore want to continue to be friends with the people of the United Kingdom, but friendship can only exist when we treat each other as equals, not in a relationship between ruler and ruled."

    In his speech, Lim Yew Hock also expressed his hope that "one day the Federation of Malaya and Singapore will be able to become a unified Malayan nation."

    The head of the British government delegation, Colonial Secretary Lennox-Boyd, who presided over the meeting, said in his speech that the British government's aim was to "protect" Singapore from "internal and external attacks" and to ensure that Singapore continued to be a Western strategic base and a center for commerce and trade in Southeast Asia.

    新加坡和英国开始谈判
    林有福要求英国实践给新加坡自治的诺言
    据新华社12日讯　伦敦消息：新加坡和英国3月11日开始在伦敦举行谈判，讨论新加坡在英联邦内实行内部自治的问题。
    新加坡代表团团长、首席部长林有福在谈判的开幕式上要英国政府实践以前所作的给予新加坡自治的诺言。林有福说：“新加坡人民想同联合王国人民继续作朋友，但是，只有在彼此以平等相待而不是存在着统治者与被统治者之间的关系的情况下，才能有友谊可言。”
    林有福在演说中并且表示希望“有一天马来亚联合邦和新加坡能够成为一个统一的马来亚国家。”
    主持会议的英国政府代表团团长、殖民地大臣伦诺克斯—波伊德在致词中说，英国政府的目的是要“保护”新加坡免受到“内部的和外部的攻击”，使新加坡继续成为西方的战略基地和东南亚的商业和贸易的中心。
