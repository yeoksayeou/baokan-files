I fully support Chairman Mao's and Premier Zhou's reports and agree with the reports of other leading comrades.

I am the director of the Red Flag Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xingfu Township, Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province. In the year since our cooperative achieved advanced cooperativization, following the instructions of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Committee, adhering to the tasks set forth in the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) and the national development production guidelines and policies, thanks to the active labor of all male and female members of the village, we have achieved increased production and increased income in the face of severe disaster.

	A Year of Victory

Natural disasters were more severe than in previous years, but we increased production and the income of cooperative members increased.

Our village has only 183 households, 178 male laborers, 120 female laborers, and 815 hectares of cultivated land. In each agricultural production season of 1956, when advanced cooperativization was achieved, we suffered more severe natural disasters than in previous years. During spring plowing and sowing, we suffered a wind disaster. After sowing, the seeds of more than 20 hectares of wheat were exposed by the wind, or some of the seeds were blown away. The entire village mobilized the male and female labor force of four production teams to use carts and carry the soil that had been blown onto the roads or into the trenches back to the wheat fields for covering, compaction, and replanting, ensuring full seedlings. When hoeing the second time, we suffered hail and insect disasters. Hailstones battered the leaves of sorghum and corn to shreds, and the heads of soybeans were knocked off. Insects ate the crops, causing missing seedlings and broken rows. At this time, the entire cooperative's male and female labor force worked together to increase the number of hoeings and apply more manure to the disaster-stricken crops, allowing them to recover quickly. Many laborers were also mobilized to dig out insects, digging out a total of 51,000 mole crickets, preventing the crops from continuing to be harmed. Especially during the entire summer hoeing season, there were more than 50 consecutive days of overcast and rainy weather. The cooperative mobilized all human and animal power. During hoeing, they did not return home in heavy rain and did not stop working in light rain. They hoed grass by hand in areas prone to water accumulation, and dug 11 drainage ditches. The entire cooperative's male and female labor force worked from dawn till dusk, engaging in fierce struggles with rain, water, and weeds, basically completing two hoeings and two cultivations, without leaving a single hectare of land uncultivated or a single ridge of land unplanted. Because the cooperative had a large number of people and great strength, it resisted or reduced the intrusion of natural disasters, allowing various major crops to still achieve a bumper harvest in such a year of many disasters. In terms of grain, the average yield of various grain crops in the entire cooperative was 6.2 dan per hectare (450 jin per dan, totaling 2,790 jin), an increase of 135 jin per hectare compared to the bumper harvest of 1955, i.e., an increase of 5.2% (2,655 jin per hectare in 1955), and an increase of 900 jin per hectare compared to 1953, when the disaster situation was not as severe as in 1956, i.e., an increase of 47% (1,890 jin per hectare in 1953). Because the cooperative increased production and harvested more grain, it sold 300,000 jin more grain to the state in the disaster-stricken year of 1956 than in the lightly disaster-stricken year of 1953 with the same cultivated area. This fact shows the superiority of advanced cooperativization in increasing production and income, and also shows that the first year of running our advanced cooperative was a victory and a success. If our village had not achieved advanced cooperativization in 1956, at least the following points would not have been possible:

	Because Advanced Cooperativization Was Achieved

Severe disasters can also lead to increased production; can comprehensively increase income; promote technological reforms; improve attendance rates; implement the "Five Guarantees"; engage in diversified operations; and prepare for spring plowing in a timely manner.

1. If advanced cooperativization had not been achieved, in the face of such a severe disaster situation in 1956, there would not only have been no increase in production, but there would have been a significant reduction in production. In 1953, the degree of disaster suffered by our village was not as severe as in 1956, and more than 110 hectares (accounting for 13.5% of the village's cultivated area) were flooded and left uncultivated. Half of the land in Panjiatun in our village was abandoned. Most of the crops in the village were only hoed and cultivated one and a half times, resulting in 43% less grain than in 1956. If advanced cooperativization had not been achieved, as the cooperative members said, half of the village's crops would have been abandoned, and at best, there would have been a 40% harvest.

2. If advanced cooperativization had not been achieved, the income of all farmers in the village could not have been comprehensively increased, and everyone could not have become prosperous. In 1953, when the disaster situation was lighter than in 1956, 60% of the farm households in the village lacked food grain. Only four of the more than 30 households in Wangjiaweizi Village in our village had enough to eat. Many households ate horse feed and seeds, and some sold their horses, causing great difficulties for production in 1954. As a result, rich middle peasants and new rich peasants took advantage of the disaster and the lack of food and clothing to raise grain prices and lend money at high interest rates, buying vehicles and horses, and carrying out cruel exploitation of poor peasants. However, in 1956, when advanced cooperativization was achieved, although it was a year of severe disasters, the income of 95% of the farm households in the entire cooperative increased compared to the bumper harvest of 1955. The average annual income of each male laborer was generally more than 400 yuan, and the average income of each female laborer was generally more than 100 yuan. 100% of the farm households were able to eat their fill and keep warm. The cooperative members all said: "Joining the cooperative has eradicated the roots of poverty and laid the foundations for prosperity. There are no disaster victims in disaster years. We will never be exploited again and will never go bankrupt again."

3. If advanced cooperativization had not been achieved, it would not have been possible to promote effective technical production-increasing measures on a large scale. Before the achievement of advanced cooperativization, only more than 100 hectares of wheat in the village were flat-sown, and only a few hectares of sorghum and soybeans were sown. However, in 1956, when advanced cooperativization was achieved, because the land was managed in a unified manner and human and animal power could be easily allocated in a unified manner, the flat-sown area of various crops reached more than 330 hectares, more than double that of 1955. Intercropping was promoted on 288 hectares of land. In terms of manure fertilizer, all cultivated land in 1956 was fertilized (only 75% was fertilized in 1955), and the average amount of fertilizer applied per hectare reached more than 30,000 jin. The "Five Haves and Three Diligences" were promoted ("Five Haves" are: horses have sheds, pigs have pens, wells have covers, every household has toilets, every household has manure pits; "Three Diligences" are: diligence in getting up early, diligence in padding, diligence in cleaning), and perennial manure accumulation was carried out, changing the habit of temporary and concentrated manure accumulation. The promotion of only the above-mentioned three production-increasing measures of flat sowing, intercropping, and increased fertilization increased grain production by nearly 100,000 jin compared to the bumper harvest of 1955.

4. If advanced cooperativization had not been achieved, the labor attendance rate of farmers could not have been rapidly improved. In 1955, farmers in the entire village only worked 48,000 labor days, and the average laborer worked 240 labor days. However, in 1956, when advanced cooperativization was achieved, due to the development of diversified operations and the ease of labor allocation, the labor enthusiasm of cooperative members was fully developed. The entire cooperative worked a total of 61,500 labor days throughout the year, and the average laborer worked 300 labor days, an increase of 28% compared to 1955. The increase in labor efficiency not only favorably overcame natural disasters, but also ensured the completion of various agricultural production infrastructure construction and the realization of various technical production-increasing measures. This was the main force that enabled the achievement of a bumper harvest in 1956 despite the relatively severe disaster situation.

5. If advanced cooperativization had not been achieved, the lives of some elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled farmers in our village could not have been adequately guaranteed. Before advanced cooperativization, there were 10 households of elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled farmers in our village who relied on state relief every year. After the achievement of advanced cooperativization, the cooperative implemented the "Five Guarantees," and we gave appropriate arrangements to these "Five Guarantees" households according to their different situations. For example, the four elderly men in the "Five Guarantees" households who had a small amount of labor power but were rich in production experience were assigned the task of growing melons and yellow tobacco. There was also a pig herder and a night watchman. Because Tang Xianzhong's family, who had poor eyesight, had many children and had difficulty making a living, the cooperative allocated 1.2 hectares of land to him to grow corn, and the cooperative provided labor and paid public grain on his behalf. In this way, the grain and stalks harvested by a family of seven in a year were enough to eat and burn. All the "Five Guarantees" households received 620 jin of grain per person, enough firewood to burn, and some pocket money. The lives of some households whose income was reduced due to illness were also given appropriate care by the public welfare fund.

6. If advanced cooperativization had not been achieved, it would not have been possible to make the best use of people's talents, and it would not have been possible to engage in diversified operations and increase income from multiple sources. In previous years, there were some elderly people in the village who still had labor power but were idle at home because they did not have suitable work. Some people with certain skills could not give full play to their expertise. After advanced cooperativization, due to the development of diversified operations, these people were able to have the opportunity to give full play to their expertise. The cooperative collectively raised 48 breeding pigs, more than 100 sheep, 58 cattle, and 32 horses, planted more than 3 hectares of fruit trees, and jointly operated a brick kiln with a fraternal cooperative. Some elderly people and people with various experiences in the cooperative participated in production. People with fruit tree cultivation skills were assigned to manage fruit trees; people with red brick production skills were assigned to jointly operate a brick kiln with fraternal cooperatives, thereby increasing the cooperative's income. The income from sideline occupations throughout the year in 1956 reached more than 17,000 yuan. Old Dong, who was idle at home in previous years, earned more than 300 yuan throughout the year in 1956 because he participated in melon production, which was equivalent to what a young and strong full laborer earned.

7. If advanced cooperativization had not been achieved, the production materials for 1957 would not have been prepared so completely. In previous years, some mutual aid groups and farm households in our village were short of fodder or seeds, or their vehicles and horse harnesses were incomplete, which led to delays in sowing or rough cultivation. After the achievement of advanced cooperativization, the cooperative had sufficient seeds and fodder, and all agricultural implements were complete, which ensured that this year's spring plowing and sowing could be carried out in a timely manner.

Due to the above-mentioned advantages shown in production in the year since advanced cooperativization, the cooperative increased production, the income of cooperative members increased, and the material and cultural lives of cooperative members also improved to a certain extent. 80% of the male and female members of the entire cooperative, especially the male members, wore cotton-padded coats or leather coats with flannel collars; some wore leather cotton shoes; 22 households in the entire cooperative had coal stoves installed in their homes this year; 15% of the households renovated their houses with colored paper; and radio loudspeakers were installed in various villages and in the homes of some cooperative members, so they could listen to Beijing's broadcasts while sitting on the heated kang. 70%-80% of the young and middle-aged men and women in the entire village participated in winter studies and were able to persist in regular learning. Due to the improvement in the lives of cooperative members, all school-age children in the entire village were enrolled in school. Due to the implementation of the "Five Haves and Three Diligences," the sanitary conditions in the countryside were also gradually changing, and the phenomena of many flies, many mosquitoes, and many feces in the countryside were gradually decreasing. Cooperative members and their families who were sick were also able to receive timely treatment.

	Neglectable shortcomings

Loosening of ideological leadership; blindness in technological transformation; Insufficient implementation of the policy of democratic cooperative management.

The achievements of the past year of advanced cooperativization are great, and the result of running advanced cooperatives in the first year is a victory and a success. This fully proves that the socialist system is superior. However, because this is a new undertaking and the first year, there is no experience, so there are still many shortcomings in the work of the year.

1. We paid attention to the leadership of production and relaxed the leadership of thought. We did not realize that today's cooperative members are yesterday's dispersed individual producers. Because we neglected ideological education, after the achievement of advanced cooperativization, some cooperative members exposed their inherent selfish and self-interested behaviors as individual producers. In addition, our cooperative cadres lacked production management experience, the system was unsound, and the quotas were inaccurate. Therefore, phenomena such as only seeking quantity and disregarding quality, not observing labor discipline, and not cherishing public property once occurred in production.

2. We also had some problems in technological transformation. Flat sowing is an important measure to increase production, but in 1956 we expanded the flat sowing area regardless of conditions. We sowed sorghum on land that had not been spring-plowed or autumn-plowed and only shallowly broke the stubble with old plows. It was neither drought-resistant nor flood-resistant, and as a result, the flat-sown sorghum yielded 30% less. In terms of intercropping, we also blindly intercropped sorghum that had not been successfully tested in soybean fields, resulting in wasted labor.

3. The policy of democratic cooperative management was not fully implemented. The decisions made by the management committee of the cooperative were not fully mobilized for discussion by the cooperative members and were forced to be implemented. There were many meetings of the cooperative, but few activities of the team and production group. Only the enthusiasm of a few leading cadres was relied on to do things, and the wisdom of all cooperative members could not be well developed.

Although the above-mentioned shortcomings are very minor compared with the achievements made in the year of cooperativization, they are also not negligible, because if we had not had the above-mentioned shortcomings in 1956, it can be said with certainty that our achievements would have been even greater. Therefore, this year we must strive to overcome shortcomings, improve our work, further run the cooperative well, respond to Chairman Mao's call, and strive for a bumper harvest in 1957!

    实现高级合作化　遇到重灾也不怕
　　高凤志介绍红旗合作社战胜灾荒取得丰收的一年
    我完全拥护毛主席和周总理的报告并同意其他几位首长的报告。
    我是黑龙江省绥化县兴福乡红旗农业生产合作社的社主任，我们社在实现高级合作化的一年来，本着中国共产党和人民委员会的指示，遵循着全国农业发展纲要（草案）所提出的任务以及国家发展生产的方针和政策，由于全村男女社员的积极劳动，在生产方面取得了重灾情况下的增加生产和增加收入的成绩。
　　胜利的第一年
    自然灾害较往年严重，但是我们增产了，社员收入增加了。
    我们村只一百八十三户，男劳动力一百七十八个，女劳动力一百二十个，耕地面积八百一十五垧。在实现高级合作化的1956年的各个农业生产季节中均受到了较往年严重的自然灾害。在春耕播种时遭受了风灾，二十多垧的麦子播种后被风刮的露了子或有的子被风刮走了。全村动员了四个生产队的男女劳动力，将已刮到大道上或壕沟里的土用车拉、用人抬到麦地里进行了补盖、镇压和补种，保证了全苗。铲二遍地时又遭了雹灾和虫灾，雹子将高粱、包米的叶子打得稀烂，大豆的脑袋被打掉了，虫子将庄稼吃的缺苗断条。这时候全社的男女劳动力一齐动手，将受灾的庄稼增加铲趟遍数和增施粪肥，使庄稼得以迅速恢复过来了；又动员了不少的劳动力进行挖虫子，一共挖出五万一千个蚍虫，使庄稼免于继续受害。特别是在夏锄的整个季节中，阴雨连绵五十多天，社里调动了所有的人畜力，在铲趟中大雨不回家，小雨不停工，不能铲趟的手薅草，并在易存水的地带挖了十一条排水壕。全社男女劳动力起早贪黑，和雨、水、草进行了激烈的斗争，基本上完成了两铲两趟，没有撩荒一垧，没有扔地一垄。由于合作社人多力量大，抵抗或减轻了自然灾害的侵袭，使之在这样多灾的年景里，各种主要作物依然获得了丰收，在粮食方面，全社各种粮食作物的产量平均每垧打六点二石（每石四百五十斤，共核二千七百九十斤），比丰收的55年每垧增产一百三十五斤，即增产5.2％（55年每垧产量二千六百五十五斤），比没有56年灾情严重的53年每垧增九百斤，即增产47％（53年每垧产量一千八百九十斤）。由于合作社增加了生产，多打了粮食，在同样的耕地面积，重灾的56年比轻灾的53年还多卖给国家三十万斤粮食。这种事实，说明了高级合作化能够增加生产增加收入的优越性，也说明了我们办高级合作社的第一年是胜利的，是成功的。假若1956年我们村不实现高级合作化的话，至少，下面几点是作不到的：
　　因为实现了高级合作化
    重灾也能增产；能全面增加收入；推行技术改革；提高出勤率；推行“五保”；进行多种经营；及时准备春耕。
    1、如不实现高级合作化，在1956年这样重灾的情况下，不但不会增产，而且会有很大的减产。53年我们村受灾的程度没有56年重，全村还被淹和撩荒了一百一十来垧（占全村耕地面积的13.5％），我们村潘家屯的地扔了一半。全村大部分的庄稼只铲趟一遍半，比56年少收了43％的粮食。如不实现高级合作化的话，正如社员们所说的：全村的庄稼得扔一半，好了能有四成年景。
    2、如不实现高级合作化，全村农民不能够全面增加收入，大家富裕。比56年灾情还轻的53年，全村有60％的农户缺吃粮，我们村王家围子屯三十多户中只有四户不缺吃的。不少户把马料和种子都吃掉了，有的把马卖了，给54年的生产造成了很大的困难。于是富裕中农和新富农趁大家受灾而缺吃少穿的时候，大量抬粮放账，买车买马，向贫困农民进行残酷的剥削。而实现高级合作化的56年，虽然是重灾的年景，但全社95％的农户较丰收的55年还增加了收入，每个男劳动力一般一年收入达四百元以上，女劳动力一般收入一百元以上。100％的农户都能够吃饱穿暖。社员们都说：“参加合作社，挖掉了穷根，扎下了富根，有灾年景没有灾民，今后永远再不受剥削，再不能破产了。”
    3、如不实现高级合作化，不可能在大面积上推行有效的技术增产措施。在没有实现高级合作化以前，全村只有一百多垧地的小麦进行了平播，其余高粱、大豆只播了几垧。而实现高级合作化的56年，由于土地实行了统一经营，人畜力便于统一调配，各种作物的平播面积达三百三十多垧，超过55年的二倍。推行了二百八十八垧地的混种作物。在粪肥方面，56年的耕地全部施了粪肥（55年只施肥75％），平均每垧施肥量达三万斤以上。推行了“五有三勤”（五有是：马有棚、猪有圈、井有盖、家家有厕所、户户有粪坑；三勤是：勤起、勤垫、勤打扫），进行了常年积肥，改变了临时突击积肥的习惯。只上述平播、混种和增施粪肥三项增产措施的推行，比丰收的55年就增产了将近十万斤的粮食。
    4、如不实现高级合作化，农民的劳动出勤率得不到迅速提高。55年全村农民只作了四万八千个劳动日，一般劳动力平均作二百四十个劳动日。而实现高级合作化的56年，由于开展了多种经营和便于劳动力调配，便于人尽其才，社员的劳动积极性得到了充分的发挥，全社全年共作了六万一千五百个劳动日，一般的都作三百个劳动日，较55年提高28％，由于劳动效率的提高不但能够有利的战胜了自然灾害，而且亦保证了各项农业生产基本建设的完成与各种技术增产措施的实现。这是56年能以在灾情比较严重的情况下能以获得丰收的主要力量。
    5、如不实现高级合作化，我们村中的一些老、弱、孤、寡及残疾农民的生活得不到应有的保证。我们村中在高级合作化以前，有十户老、弱、孤、寡和残疾的农民每年都依靠国家进行救济。实现高级合作化后，合作社由于推行了“五保”，这些五保户我们分别不同情况都给予了适当安排。如“五保”户中的四个有少量劳动力的农民而生产经验丰富的老头，分配给他们种瓜、种黄烟的任务。还有一个放猪的，一个打更的。对视力不好的唐显忠家因孩子多，生活困难，社里拨给他一垧二亩地种包米，由社给代耕马力及出公粮，这样一家七口人一年所收的粮食和秸棵够吃够烧了。所有的五保户每口人都得到了六百二十斤的粮食、足够烧的柴火和部分的零用钱。对部分因疾病而减少收入的户，他们的生活也由公益金给予适当的照顾。
      6、如不实现高级合作化，不能作到人尽其才，不可能作到多种经营，从多方面增加收入。往年村里有一些年纪比较大的但还有劳动力的人，由于没有适当工作而在家闲着，有些具有某些技术的人不能够发挥其特长。高级合作化后，由于开展了多种经营，使这些人都能够有机会发挥自己的特长。社里集体养了四十八口猪种，一百来只羊，五十八头牧牛，三十二匹牧马，种植了三垧多果木树，并与兄弟社合营了一处砖窑。社里一些年老和具有一些有各种经验的人都参加了生产，有栽培果树技术的人分配他经营果树；有生产红砖技术的人，分配他与兄弟社合营砖窑，因而增加了社的收入。56年全年一年的副业收入达一万七千多元。往年在家闲着的老董头，由于56年参加了种瓜的生产，他全年收入了三百多元，相当于一个年青力壮的整劳动力所挣的。
    7、如不实现高级合作化，57年的生产物资不会准备这么齐全。我们村往年一到春耕时，就有部分的互助组和农户不是缺草料，就是缺子种，再不就是车马绳套不周全，以致有的竟因此而耽误播种期或造成耕作粗糙。实现高级合作化后，全社的子种、草料充足，一切农具俱全，这就保证了今年的春耕播种能够作到及时。
    由于高级合作化一年来在生产中显示了上述各项的优越性，社里增加了生产，社员增加了收入，社员的物质和文化生活也随之得到了一定程度的改善。全社的男女社员特别是男社员80％的都穿上了栽绒领的棉大衣或皮大衣；有的穿上了皮棉鞋；全社有二十二户今年家里都生上了煤火炉子；15％的户将屋子用彩纸裱糊一新；各个屯和部分社员的家中都安装上了广播喇叭，坐在火炕上就能听到北京的广播。全村70％—80％的青壮年男女都参加了冬学并能坚持经常的学习。由于社员生活的提高，全村的适龄的儿童都入了学。由于“五有三勤”的推行，农村的卫生面貌也在逐步改变，农村苍蝇多、蚊子多、粪便多的现象也逐渐减少了。社员及其家属有病的也都能够得到及时的治疗。
　　不容忽视的缺点
    放松了思想领导；在技术改革上有盲目性；民主办社方针贯彻得不够。
    高级合作化一年来的成绩是很大的，第一年办高级社的结果是胜利的，成功的。这充分的证明了社会主义制度是优越的。但由于这是一件新事业，又是头一年，没有经验，因而在一年的工作中还存在着不少的缺点。
    1、我们注意了生产的领导而放松了思想领导。我们没有注意到今天合作社的社员就是昨天分散的个体生产的农民，由于我们忽视了思想教育，因而在实现高级合作化后，在集体生产中，部分的社员暴露了他们的个体生产者所固有的自私自利行为，再加之我们社干部又缺乏生产管理的经验，制度不健全，定额不准确，因之在生产中曾出现过只求数量不顾质量、不遵守劳动纪律、不爱护公共财产现象。
    2、在技术改革上我们也存在着一些毛病。平播是增产的重要措施，但我们在56年曾不顾条件的来扩大平播面积，将没有春翻和秋翻的地只用旧犁浅破了槎子就播上了高粱，既不抗旱，又不抗涝，结果平播的高粱减产了30％。在混种方面，我们也盲目的在大豆地里混种了未经试验成功的高粱，结果白搭了工。
    3、民主办社的方针贯彻的不够。社的管理委员会所作出的决定没有充分发动社员讨论，硬往下贯。社的会议多，队和生产小组的活动少，只凭几个领导干部的热情去办事，而没能很好的发挥全体社员的智慧。
    上述的缺点与合作化一年所取得的成绩比较起来虽然是非常次要的，但也是不可忽视的，因为我们在56年中如没有上述缺点的话，肯定的说我们的成绩将会更大。所以今年我们要努力克服缺点，改进工作，进一步办好合作社，响应毛主席的号召，为争取57年的大丰收而奋斗！（附图片）
