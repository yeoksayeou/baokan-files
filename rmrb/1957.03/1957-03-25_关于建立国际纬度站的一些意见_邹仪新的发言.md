　　Some Opinions on Establishing International Latitude Stations
　　Speech by Zou Yixin

　　I fully support Chairman Mao's instructions and the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li, and Vice Chairman Chen. I would like to offer some opinions on the establishment of international latitude stations in our country.

　　The Earth's rotational pole is not fixed but continuously undergoes periodic, complex, and minute movements within the Earth itself. Therefore, the longitude, latitude, time, etc., measured at any location and at any moment on Earth must be corrected for the effects of this polar motion in cases requiring high precision. In the Soviet Union, such corrections are mandatory for first and second-order astronomical survey points. With the development of socialist construction in our country, geodetic surveying work is accelerating, and we have achieved excellent results in learning from the Soviet Union. Therefore, the study of polar motion (or the study of latitude variation) has become an urgent astronomical task for our country. At the same time, this research can provide data for geology and geophysics. Its significance is great.

　　Polar motion is extremely small (maximum about 0".3), and its amplitude cannot yet be theoretically calculated. It can only be determined through precise astronomical observations, hence the necessity of international cooperation in measuring latitude. This international cooperation began in 1899 when several international latitude stations were established along the 39°8' North latitude circle. Participants included Russia, Japan, the United States, and Italy. When I was studying in Japan in 1935, Japan had been participating in international cooperation for over 30 years. A friend jokingly pointed to the globe and said, "Look, Japan only has a small spot on this international latitude line, and they are participating. China is so big; you should join soon too!" The reactionary rulers at that time would not value science, adapt to needs, or engage in international cooperation! For many years after returning to China, I didn't even dare to dream of this.

　　Last August, a regional conference of the International Geophysical Year was held in Moscow with the participation of several countries. The conference suggested that China establish an international latitude station south of Beijing to participate in the International Geophysical Year work starting this July. Soviet astronomers have made the same suggestion to us. I personally believe that this international proposal demonstrates the importance attached to our country. This is our honor and our international obligation, and we should shoulder it well. The Academy of Sciences agreed to this work last year, with the Purple Mountain Observatory in charge.

　　This type of latitude observation is to determine latitude variation to find polar motion, while geodetic surveying latitude and longitude observation is to determine the position of any point on Earth. The purposes, instruments, and required accuracy of the two types of work are different. Many people throughout the country are doing geodetic surveying latitude and longitude determination, including our Purple Mountain Observatory, but no one in the country is doing latitude variation work yet. The quality of this astronomical observation mainly depends on the instruments and auxiliary tools. Therefore, before the start of international latitude work, it was stipulated that, in addition to establishing stations on the same latitude line:

　　(1) Each station should use the same instruments and build the same observation room and instrument base; (2) Observe the same stars and follow the same observation plan; (3) The final value of polar motion is obtained by the International Central Bureau for Latitude Service, which collects the observation results from each station for calculation. Since we are undertaking this international task, we should follow the regulations and purchase the two new types of instruments used by the Soviet Union, Japan, and other countries in the International Geophysical Year. The Academy of Sciences has attached great importance to this work. Therefore, to effectively carry out this work, I hope that the state will consider ordering the currently urgently needed instruments as soon as possible within its capabilities. Of course, at a time when the state is streamlining and saving, we should adhere to the principle of diligence and frugality in running science to carry out our capital construction. However, we still hope that instruments related to work quality and international cooperation can be ordered.

　　Since the Party put forward the call to march towards science, we astronomical workers have also felt extremely excited and are willing to contribute all our strength to carry out arduous research work and accelerate the advancement of our country's astronomy. Chairman Mao taught us that modesty makes one progress, and arrogance makes one lag behind. Therefore, we astronomical workers must humbly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other countries, strengthen unity, work hard, and make more contributions to the cause of socialism.

### 关于建立国际纬度站的一些意见　邹仪新的发言

　　关于建立国际纬度站的一些意见
　　邹仪新的发言
    我完全拥护毛主席的指示，周总理、李副总理和陈副主席的报告。我想就有关我国国际纬度站的建立问题，提供一些意见。
    地球的自转极点在地球本身，不是固定不变的，而在不断地作周期性复杂的微小的移动。因此，地球上任何地点、任何时刻所测得的经度、纬度和时刻等，在高度精确的场合下，都要修正这种地极移动所发生的影响。苏联一二等天文点的测量是规定要修正的。我国随着社会主义建设的发展，大地测量工作正在加速进行，且在学习苏联上取得了很好的成绩。因此，地极移动的研究（或称纬度变化的研究），已经成为我国急需开展的一项天文工作了；同时，这种研究可以对地质学及地球物理学提供资料。它的意义是很大的。
    地极移动为量极微（最大约0”．3），且其振幅至今还不能由理论求出，而只能从精密的天文观测来决定，因而有国际联合测纬度的必要。这种国际合作，开始于1899年，当时沿北纬圈39°8’，设立几个国际纬度站，参加者有俄国、日本、美国和意大利。当我1935年在日本留学时，日本参加国际合作已三十年以上。有一位朋友指着地球仪像开玩笑地说：“看，日本只有一小点地方在这条国际纬度线上，也参加了，你们中国这么一大块，也快点参加罢！”当时的反动统治那会重视科学、适应需要和国际合作呢！回国多年，我连梦也不敢梦到这点。
    去年8月在莫斯科召开了有好些国家参加的国际地球物理年区域性会议，会中建议中国在北京之南建立国际纬度站来参加今年7月开始的国际地球物理年工作。苏联天文家对我们也作同样的建议。我个人认为这个国际性的建议表明对我国的重视。这是我们的光荣，也是我们的国际义务，我们应该很好地担负起来。这一工作，科学院已于去年答应下来了，由紫金山天文台负责。
    这种纬度观测，是为了决定纬度变化来求地极移动，而大地测量的经纬度观测是为了决定地球上任一地点的位置，两种工作的目的，仪器和所要求的准确度等是不同的。大地测量的经纬度测定，全国很多人在做；包括我们紫金山天文台在内，但做纬度变化的，至今全国还没有。这种天文观测的质量主要决定于仪器和附属工具。故在国际纬度工作开始之前，除了规定在同一纬线上设站外，早已规定：
  （1）各站应该用同样的仪器，建造同样的观测室和仪器基墩；（2）观测同样的星，遵守同样的观测计划；（3）地极移动最后值的获得，由国际测纬工作中央局集中各站观测结果来计算。我们既担任这个国际任务，自应遵照规定，购置像苏联、日本等国在国际地球物理年所用的那两种新式的仪器。科学院院部对这项工作已加以重视。因此，为了有效地进行这一工作，目前所急迫需要的仪器，我希望在可能范围内请求国家考虑，从速订购。当然，在国家精简节约的时候，我们应当坚持勤俭办科学的方针来作我们的基本建设；不过关系到工作质量和国际合作的仪器，仍盼能获订购。
    自从党提出向科学进军的号召之后，我们天文工作者同样感到无比的兴奋，都愿意贡献自己的一切力量，进行艰苦的研究工作，加速地把我国天文事业向前推进。毛主席教导我们虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后。因此，我们天文工作者必须虚心学习苏联和其他国家的先进经验，加强团结，努力工作，为社会主义事业作出更多的贡献。（附图片）
