    Victory Is Hard-Won: Don't Forget the Tradition of Hard Work
    Yang Zhihua on Comrade Xiang Jingyu's Deeds of Hard Struggle and Heroic Sacrifice

    Hard work and plain living are the fine traditions of the Chinese people. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we have carried forward this tradition and achieved revolutionary victory through constant and heroic struggle.

    Our victory today is the victory of the ideals that many revolutionary martyrs fought heroically for, shed their blood for, and sought diligently. While we are always happy for the victory, we must also always remember the many martyrs who heroically sacrificed themselves for our ideals. One of them was our outstanding female revolutionary of the Chinese proletariat, our beloved Comrade Xiang Jingyu, who sacrificed herself nearly thirty years ago.

    I first met her in 1924, in Shanghai. Comrades and friends were very willing to approach her at first sight of her simple demeanor and amiable conversation. She seemed to be an ordinary woman, but she had a very prominent strong character and transcendent wisdom.

    She was good at reasoning and writing articles. Her speeches and articles inspired the vast number of young people to embark on the revolutionary road. In the movement to support Mr. Sun Yat-sen's proposal for a national convention, she gave speeches everywhere, to the point of forgetting food and sleep. She paid great attention to the work of the united front and was good at uniting people from all walks of life. Before each meeting, she personally ran around inviting people to the meeting. Those who were invited were deeply moved by her sincere attitude and hardworking spirit. She worked wholeheartedly and selflessly, neither for fame nor for profit. At that time, she had no fame or status in the Party or in society, let alone any special enjoyment. She worked only for the ideal of revolution. She was busy with work all day long, and in the evening she would go back to write articles, study Marxism-Leninism, and take notes. She often said that she would read when work required it, and use what she had read. She did not read as a tool for her own pride, but to do her job well and help others.

    Her life was very simple. Her husband, Comrade Cai Hesen, had lung disease, and she had no money to treat him. She borrowed tens of dollars from a few friends. Because she was leading the propaganda group, she did not have time to go home and give the money to Cai Hesen, who was lying ill in bed. While she was giving a speech on the street, a thief stole the money from her pocket. At that time, she only ate one lunch a day, and there were no servants at home. She cooked her own meals, and the other two meals were just something simple at a street stall. In 1925, she returned to her home in Hunan and gave birth to a child. For the sake of revolutionary work, she left her lovely child and came out to work. She never had the chance to see this child again, but she often thought of him. She loved other people's children with the same feeling as loving her own child. Although she had no money, she still saved a little money to buy candy for our children and Mr. Mao Dun's children.

    After the Wuhan coup in 1927, Comrade Xiang Jingyu persisted in working under white terror. She was arrested in the concession. The French judge tried her several times. In court, she said, "You have no right to try me. This is in China. You have invaded Chinese territory, which is a crime. I am going to try you!" The judge had no choice but to extradite her to the Chinese authorities. The heroic and unyielding Comrade Xiang Jingyu sacrificed herself under the butcher's knife of the vile reactionary rulers on May 1st, 1928.

    Comrade Xiang Jingyu's blood was not shed in vain, and the blood of thousands of revolutionary martyrs was not shed in vain. We followed in the footsteps of the martyrs and finally marched towards victory.

    Now that we have won, let us not forget Comrade Xiang Jingyu's lifelong unwavering will to work selflessly for the cause of communism; let us not forget her quality of not seeking empty fame but doing practical things; let us not forget her style of hard work and plain living, and down-to-earth work; let us not forget her enthusiastic, diligent, eager-to-learn, and tireless spirit. Why am I talking about such a person at today's meeting? Because today is "March 8th" International Working Women's Day, all women and all people in the country must inherit the revolutionary tradition of hard work and plain living, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, overcome various difficulties to complete the arduous task of building a socialist society. We will definitely be able to achieve greater victories. (Attached picture)

    胜利得来不易　勿忘艰苦传统
    杨之华谈向警予同志艰苦奋斗壮烈牺牲的事迹
    艰苦朴素是我们中国人民的优良传统。在中国共产党的领导下，我们发扬了这种传统，并且在不断地英勇斗争中，取得了革命的胜利。
    我们今天的胜利，就是我们许多先烈英勇奋斗，流血牺牲，孜孜以求的理想的胜利。我们时时为胜利高兴，也时时要想起许多为我们的理想而英勇牺牲了的先烈。其中有一位我们卓越的中国无产阶级的女革命家，就是我们敬爱的向警予同志，她牺牲将近三十年了。
    我和她最初认识是在1924年，在上海。同志和朋友们一见她朴素的风度，和蔼的谈吐，就很愿意接近她。看去她是一个平凡的女人，可是她有非常突出的坚强的性格和超越的智慧。
    她善于说理，会写文章。她的演说和文章启发了广大青年走上了革命的道路。她在拥护孙中山先生提出的全国国民会议的运动中，到处演讲，以致废寝忘食。她十分注意统一战线的工作，善于团结各界人士。她在每次会议之前，都是亲自奔波邀人开会。被邀的人对她那样诚恳的态度，吃苦耐劳的工作精神，没有一个不受深切感动的。她一心一意忘我工作，既不为名也不为利。她当时在党内和社会上都没有什么名誉地位，更没有什么特殊享受，她只是为着革命的理想而工作。她整天忙于工作，晚上回去还写文章，学习马克思列宁主义，做笔记。她常说，在工作需要的时候读书，读了书就用。她读书不是作为自己骄傲的工具，而是为了做好工作，帮助别人。
    她的生活很简单。她的丈夫蔡和森同志有肺病，她没有钱为他治病，向几个朋友借了几十块钱，她因为领导了宣传小组，来不及回家把钱交给卧病在床的蔡和森同志。当她在街上讲演的时候，一个小偷从她的衣袋中偷走了钱。那时，她一天只吃一顿中饭，家里也没有佣人，自己烧饭，其他两顿饭，都在小摊上随便吃点什么。1925年，她回到湖南家中生了孩子。她又为了革命工作，丢下自己可爱的孩子，出来工作，以后她再也没有机会重见这个孩子，但是常常想念他，她以爱自己孩子的心情来爱别人的孩子。她虽然没有钱，还省一点钱给我们的孩子和茅盾先生的孩子买糖吃。
    1927年武汉政变后，向警予同志在白色恐怖下坚持工作，在租界上被捕了，法国审判官审判她好几次，她在法庭上说：“你没有权利审判我，这是在中国地方，你们侵占了中国的领土是犯罪的，我还要审判你哩！”法官没有办法，只好把她引渡到中国当局。英勇不屈的向警予同志，于1928年“五一”节在万恶的反动统治者的屠刀下牺牲了。
    向警予同志的血没有白流，千千万万革命先烈的血没有白流，我们踏着先烈的血迹，终于走向了胜利。
    我们胜利了，不要忘记向警予同志那种毕生为共产主义事业忘我劳动坚定不移的意志；不要忘记她那种不务虚名、会干实事的品质，不要忘记她那种艰苦朴素、脚踏实地的工作作风，不要忘记她那种热情奔放、勤勤恳恳、学而不厌、诲人不倦的精神。为什么我在今天的会议上要谈到这么一个人呢？因为今天是“三八”国际劳动妇女节，全国妇女、全国人民都必须继承艰苦朴素的革命传统，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，克服各种困难，来完成建设社会主义社会的艰巨事业，我们一定能够取得更大的胜利。（附图片）
