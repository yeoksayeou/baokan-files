    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 30th. On the day following the publication of the declarations and statements of the Soviet and Hungarian governments and parties, mass rallies were held in Budapest's 8th, 10th, 13th, and 20th districts on March 29th, attended by 70,000 to 80,000 people. Leaders of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the government, Münnich, Marosán, Biszku, and Rónai, spoke at the four rallies, respectively. In their speeches, they pointed out the great significance of the Hungarian-Soviet talks and the assistance given by the Soviet Union to Hungary.
    In the 8th district, around 40,000 to 50,000 people gathered in Republic Square in front of the Budapest City Party Committee building. This place had been the center of white terror during the October events. Marosán said in his speech that we should erect a monument here to the martyrs. Marosán pointed out that the former Hungarian Working People's Party had disintegrated, but the communists had not disintegrated, and we now have 230,000 party members. We must support the country with labor. In this regard, the miners have set a good example. On the 28th, they mined 70,000 tons of coal, which is the highest record since the October events.
    The rally concluded by reading and passing a telegram from the rally to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    感谢苏联人民的无私援助
    布达佩斯群众集会欢迎匈苏会谈结果
    据新华社布达佩斯30日电　在苏匈两国政府和两党的宣言和声明发表后的第二天，布达佩斯第八区、第十区、十三区和二十区29日举行了有七、八万人参加的群众大会。匈牙利社会主义工人党和政府的领导人明尼赫、马罗山、比斯库和罗奈伊分别在四个大会上讲了话。他们在讲话中指出了匈苏会谈和苏联给予匈牙利的援助的巨大意义。
    在第八区，布达佩斯市党委大厦面前的共和国广场上，约有四、五万群众聚集在这里。在十月事件中这里曾经是白色恐怖的中心。马罗山在讲话中说，我们应当在这里为烈士们树立起纪念碑。马罗山指出，以前的劳动人民党是瓦解了，但是共产主义者并未瓦解，我们现在已经有二十三万党员了。我们要以劳动来支持国家。在这方面，矿工们做了很好的榜样，28日这一天，他们开采了七万吨煤，这是十月事件以来的最高纪录。
    这个大会最后朗读和通过了大会致苏联共产党中央委员会的电报。
