　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 27th: The Soviet Union plans to increase its oil extraction to 97 million tons this year. Due to the high labor enthusiasm of oil workers in the competition to welcome the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, it is estimated that the actual output this year may approach 100 million tons.

　　If development continues at this rate, by 1960, the total Soviet oil production will exceed the target of 135 million tons set by the new Five-Year Plan.

　　According to this year's production plan, the total Soviet oil production will increase by 16% compared to last year. This will mainly be achieved through further development of the eastern regions, especially the oil production in the Ural and Volga River basins. Many new oil wells will be built in Bashkir, the Tatar Autonomous Republic, and the Saratov and Stalingrad regions. In Baku, the old oil-producing area of the Soviet Union, new offshore oil fields will be developed. Oil workers everywhere have decided to complete the task of producing oil ahead of schedule in the competition to welcome the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Workers of the Tatar Oil Trust have decided to produce 70,000 tons of oil for the country above the plan, and workers of the Molotov Oil Trust have decided to produce 20,000 tons more.

　　The Soviet oil industry has always been a rapidly developing industrial sector. Last year, its total oil production was 83.8 million tons, an increase of 62.1 million tons in ten years compared to 1946. Since 1950, the annual increase has been around 10 million tons. Due to the rapid increase in oil production and abundant oil resources, trains and ships have widely used oil instead of coal as fuel.

　　石油工人向十月革命节献礼
　　苏联石油今年能产一亿吨
    新华社莫斯科27日电　苏联今年计划把石油开采量增加到九千七百万吨。由于石油工人在迎接十月革命四十周年的竞赛中劳动热情高涨，据估计，今年的实际产量有可能接近一亿吨。
    如果照这样的速度发展，到1960年，苏联石油总产量将超过新五年计划规定的一亿三千五百万吨的任务。
    根据今年的生产计划，苏联今年的石油总产量将比去年增加16％。这主要将通过进一步发展东部地区，特别是乌拉尔和伏尔加河流域的石油生产来实现。在巴什基尔、鞑靼自治共和国以及萨拉托夫和斯大林格勒州等地将建设许多新油井。在苏联的老产油区巴库，将开辟新的海上油田。各地石油工人在为迎接十月革命四十周年而展开的竞赛中都决定提前完成生产石油的任务。鞑靼石油托辣斯的工人决定超计划为国家多生产七万吨石油，莫洛托夫石油托辣斯的工人决定多生产二万吨。
    苏联的石油工业一直是发展得很迅速的一个工业部门。去年，它的石油总产量是八千三百八十万吨，和1946年比较，十年间就增加了六千二百一十万吨。从1950年起，每年的增加量都在一千万吨左右。由于石油产量增加很快，石油资源又很丰富，火车和轮船都广泛用石油代替煤作燃料。
