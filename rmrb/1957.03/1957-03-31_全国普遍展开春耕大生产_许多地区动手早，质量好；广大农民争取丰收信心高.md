　　Xinhua News Agency, March 30th: The annual spring ploughing and production has been universally launched across the country.
　　In the southern provinces and those along the Yangtze River, most areas are sowing early rice. The early rice sowing in Guangdong, Sichuan, and southern Fujian has basically been completed, and now they are successively cultivating seedlings, plowing fields, and preparing for transplanting. Hainan Island, located in the tropics, has entered the busy season of rice transplanting. The fields in many counties are already lush green. Farmers in Qiongdong, Wanning, Lehui, and other counties have shifted to mid-season management, weeding, applying topdressing fertilizer, and eliminating "backward fields" after transplanting.
　　In most areas of the Yellow River basin provinces, farmers are plowing, harrowing, and delivering manure to prepare for sowing cotton, spring wheat, and early autumn crops, while also carrying out field management work such as weeding, applying topdressing fertilizer, and watering in winter wheat fields; spring sowing has begun in a small number of areas. Spring sowing in Gansu Province is currently underway, with more than half of the province's planned 30 million mu of spring wheat and miscellaneous grains already completed.
　　In many parts of Northeast China, the ice and snow have not completely melted, and the spring ploughing preparation work in various provinces has entered its final intense stage. Farmers are accumulating manure, building water conservancy projects, repairing farm tools, and carefully selecting seeds to welcome spring ploughing. In Heilongjiang Province, one-third of the manure has been delivered to the fields, and seed germination tests have been conducted in various places; women are rushing to do needlework to prepare to fully participate in agricultural production during the busy farming season.
　　Striving for a bumper agricultural harvest by all means is a characteristic of this year's spring ploughing production in various places. At present, the attendance rate of farmers in various places is generally above 80%, and in individual areas (such as Guangdong Province) and agricultural cooperatives, it reaches over 90%. In many areas, this year's spring ploughing production started earlier and with better quality than in previous years: the sowing time in Zhejiang, Sichuan, Gansu, and other provinces is generally five to ten days earlier than last year; the amount of manure in Guangdong, Fujian, Gansu, Hebei, and other provinces has increased significantly compared to previous years, and the quality of manure is generally better than last year; the paddy fields prepared by many agricultural cooperatives in Hubei Province are meticulously and evenly prepared, a rare sight in local history. Farmers in Sichuan Province, who have achieved seven consecutive years of bumper harvests since liberation, have made achievements in water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation this year that exceed the total of the past two or three years in many special districts, in order to strive for an increase of more than 3.1 billion jin of grain this year compared to last year. The newly built small-scale farmland water conservancy projects in Yibin Special District this year can irrigate more than 500,000 mu of land, which is more than the achievements made in the past four years; the planting area of double-cropping rice in the province will be expanded to more than 10 million mu, more than double that of last year. Farmers in the Huiyang and Shaoguan Special Districts of Guangdong Province have improved the soil of more than 1.2 million mu of farmland in order to change the situation of barren land and low yields. Farmers in Yichang Special District of Hubei Province generally carried out agricultural technology appraisals before sowing, conscientiously summarized and continued to promote technical measures that are effective in increasing production, and decided not to implement some technical measures that failed in previous years this year. Under the encouragement of slogans such as "Turn grain-deficient counties into surplus grain counties," "Strive for a yield of 500 jin per mu," and "Strive for 1,000 jin of grain per person," various parts of Hebei Province are launching a large-scale agricultural production increase competition movement. Members of agricultural cooperatives are offering suggestions and plans to save investment; members of agricultural cooperatives in Fangshan, Changli, and other three counties have already proposed more than 2,700 opinions on increasing production. After the agricultural cooperatives revised their production plans based on these opinions, they will increase production by more than 20 million jin of grain compared to the original plan. This year, various places have strengthened the specific leadership of agricultural production and the political and ideological education of farmers, transferred tens of thousands of cadres to the countryside to participate in and lead production, and the agricultural cooperatives have also undergone a rectification and implemented the "three guarantees" system, thereby further promoting the enthusiasm of farmers for production.

　　全国普遍展开春耕大生产
　　许多地区动手早，质量好；广大农民争取丰收信心高
    新华社30日讯  一年一度的春耕大生产，已经在全国普遍开展起来。
    在南方和长江沿岸各省，大部分地区正在进行早稻播种。广东、四川和福建南部的早稻播种已经基本结束，现在正陆续育秧、犁田，准备插秧。处于热带的海南岛已经进入插秧大忙阶段，许多县的田间已是一片葱绿，琼东、万宁、乐会等县的农民插完秧后就转入了中耕除草、施追肥和消灭“落后田”的工作。
    黄河流域各省大部分地区，农民正在一面犁地、耙地、送粪，准备播种棉花、春麦和早秋作物，一面在冬麦田里进行锄草、施追肥、浇水等田间管理工作；在一小部分地区已经开始春播。甘肃省的春播工作目前正在紧张进行，全省今年计划春播的三千多万亩春小麦和杂粮已经完成一半以上。
    东北地区许多地方的冰雪还没有完全消溶，各省的春耕准备工作已进入了最后的紧张阶段。农民们正在积肥送粪、兴修水利、检修农具、精选种子，迎接春耕。黑龙江省已有三分之一的粪肥送到地里，各地都做了种籽发芽试验；妇女们正在赶做针线活，准备农忙时全力参加农业生产。
    想尽一切办法争取农业大丰收，是今年各地春耕生产的特色。现在，各地农民的出勤率一般都在80％以上，个别地区（如广东省）和农业社达到90％以上。许多地区今年的春耕生产比往年动手早，质量好：浙江、四川、甘肃等省的播种时间，一般都比去年提早五天到十天左右；广东、福建、甘肃、河北等省的粪肥数量，都比往年大增，粪肥质量一般都比去年好；湖北省许多农业社的秧田整得又细又平，为当地历史上所罕见。解放后连续获得七年丰收的四川省农民，为了争取今年再比去年增产三十一亿多斤粮食，今年在兴修水利、造肥积肥等方面做出的成绩，在许多专区都超过了过去两三年的总和；宜宾专区今年新修成的小型农田水利工程可以灌田五十多万亩，比过去四年做出的成绩还大；全省双季稻的种植面积将要扩大到一千多万亩，比去年增加一倍多。广东省惠阳、韶关两专区的农民，为了改变土地贫瘠、产量低的情况，已经改良了一百二十多万亩农田的土壤。湖北省宜昌专区的农民在播种前普遍开展了农业技术鉴定，对增产有作用的技术措施认真地总结、继续推广，对往年推行失败的一些技术措施决定今年不再实行。河北省各地在“把缺粮县变成余粮县”、“力争亩产五百斤”、“争取每人千斤粮”等口号的鼓舞下，正在开展一个声势浩大的农业增产竞赛运动，农业社的社员们纷纷献计献策，节约投资；房山、昌黎等三县的农业社社员已经提出两千七百多条增产的意见，各农业社根据这些意见修订生产计划后，比原计划多增产两千多万斤粮食。今年，各地加强了对农业生产的具体领导和对农民的政治思想教育，抽调了数以万计的干部下乡参加生产、领导生产，农业社也进行了一番整顿、实行了“三包”制度，从而促使农民的生产积极性有了进一步的发挥。（附图片）
