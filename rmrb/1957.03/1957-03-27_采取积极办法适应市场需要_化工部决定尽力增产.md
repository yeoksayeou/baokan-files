Xinhua News Agency, March 26th -- The Ministry of Chemical Industry, at a conference of factory and mine directors held from the 22nd to the 25th, formulated a plan for comprehensively launching a production increase and economy campaign this year.

Based on the characteristics of tight supply and insufficient raw materials in the chemical industry this year, the conference determined that the guiding principle for carrying out the production increase and economy campaign this year is: to strive to increase production of all products for which raw material supplies can be guaranteed and which are needed by the market, on the condition of ensuring quality and safety; and to vigorously conserve raw materials in order to strive for increased production when raw material supplies are insufficient.

In order to increase production and meet market needs, the conference decided to re-arrange the schedules for the new construction projects of three enterprises and another three workshop projects scheduled to be put into production this year, and strive to put them into production one month ahead of schedule. In the existing factories and mines, it is also planned to adopt technical measures and promote various advanced experiences to increase production. For example, if the yield of the beta isomer of 666 produced by each electrolysis plant is increased to 14% beta isomer based on the current level, more than 7,000 tons of 666 pesticide can be produced. If the Dalian Chemical Plant appropriately changes the Wood process and uses a molten iron catalyst, the ammonia synthesis production capacity can be increased by more than double. The Shenyang Chemical Plant and the Dagu Chemical Plant are also preparing to convert most of the diaphragm electrolytic cells to wave-type cells, which can increase the production of caustic soda by 4,000 tons.

The conference decided to vigorously implement the four-pronged approach of conserving use, finding substitutes, recycling, and comprehensive utilization to solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. In terms of basic construction, it was decided to appropriately revise designs with excessively high standards and excessively large safety factors, on the premise of ensuring engineering quality, in order to save materials such as steel, wood, and cement. In terms of production, it was decided to change to oxygen oxidation in the production of aureomycin, which can save 740,000 tons of potassium permanganate per year, and the cost of aureomycin can also be greatly reduced. In addition, it is also planned to recover, utilize, and comprehensively utilize various raw materials to save state funds.

In order to ensure the realization of the production increase and economy plan, the conference decided to strictly implement the planned overhaul system for equipment. Methods such as three-level inspection, intermediate inspection, and dedicated maintenance will be adopted to eliminate unplanned repairs, accident repairs, and personal accidents.

    采取积极办法适应市场需要
　　化工部决定尽力增产
    新华社26日讯　化学工业部在22日到25日召开的厂矿长会议上，拟订出了今年全面开展增产节约运动的计划。
    这次会议根据今年化学工业产品供应紧张和原材料不足的特点，确定今年开展增产节约运动的方针是：在保证质量和安全的条件下，凡原材料供应能够保证和市场需要的产品，都要努力增产；凡原材料供应不足的，应大力节约原材料力求增产。
    为了增加产量，满足市场需要，会议决定把预定在今年内投入生产的三个企业和另外三个车间的新建工程，重新安排进度，争取提前一个月投入生产。在现有的厂矿中，也计划采取技术措施，推广多种先进经验来增加生产。例如，各电解厂生产的六六六的丙体收率，如果在现有的水平上提高到含丙体14％，就可以增产六六六农药七千多吨。大连化学工厂如果把伍德法生产流程适当改变，采用融铁触媒，就可以使氨合成的生产能力提高一倍多。沈阳化工厂和大沽化工厂也准备把隔膜电解槽大部改为波浪式槽，可以增产烧碱四千吨。
    会议决定大力贯彻节约使用、寻找代用、回收利用和综合利用的四用方针，以解决原材料不足的困难。在基本建设方面，决定在保证工程质量的前提下，适当修改标准过高和安全系数过大的设计，以节约钢材、木材、水泥等材料。在生产方面，决定在合霉素的生产中改用氧气氧化，一年可以节省过锰酸钾七十四万吨，合霉素的成本也可以大大降低。另外，还计划收回利用和综合利用多种原材料，节省国家资金。
    为了保证增产节约计划的实现，会议决定严格执行设备的计划预修制度。采用三级检查、中间检查、专人包修等方法，消灭非计划修理和事故修理及人身事故。
