Impromptu on Kundulun Zha
Gong Mu
The Zen hall is silent, far away from the bustling human world,
The wooden fish clapper sends away seventy long years.
--The grass color on the Ula Mountains greens and then turns white again,
The wild goose shadows in the Kente River go south and then return north.
Suddenly, a burst of noise drowns out the quiet chimes,
“Baogang’s” construction project begins in front of the Zha gate.
Large trucks and excavators roar, illuminating the cold winter night,
A new city suddenly rises up, blocking the north desert wind.
The camel team from the Ulanqab prairie sways its long necks,
Its eyes emit a surprised oily light, the copper bell under its jaw rings ding-ding.
That forest of chimneys, even taller than the Daqing Mountains,
Uses puffs of smoke to write the brilliance of socialism onto the clear sky.
Ningerruohe, the great lama, is moved to excitement for the first time in his life,
But his hands are still piously clasped together.
He stands in front of the hall, gazing for a long time, reciting:
“Amitabha! It is the Communist Party that has brought the Western Paradise to our Kundulun Zha.”

--1956.12.23, on the Jingbao train
Kundulun Zha is located at the foot of the Ula Mountains and has a history of over 300 years. The oldest great lama, Ningerruohe, is now over seventy years old. On December 21, 1956, we visited the Zha. Ascending the hall and looking out, we saw the new Baotou city under construction, already standing tall in the left front. We heard that the motorcade of the construction office is stationed near the Zha. It is said that the lamas in the Zha are very interested in the large-scale new construction that has suddenly appeared before them.

    昆独仑召即兴
    公木禅堂寂寂远远地离开扰攘人间，木鱼橐橐送走了悠悠七十年。——乌拉山上的草色绿了又变白，肯特河里的雁影南去又北还。忽然一阵喧嚣淹没了幽静的钟磬声，召门前开始了“包钢”底建设工程。大卡车掘土机吼叫着燃亮了严冬寒夜，一座新城斗然耸立起来遮住了朔漠沙风。来自乌兰察布草原的骆驼队摇着长颈，眼里放出惊异的油光，颔下铜铃响丁丁。那一片比起大青山来还要高的烟囱林，用朵朵云烟把社会主义的光辉写上晴空。宁格若鹤大喇嘛平生第一次激动得心跳，而他底双手还是虔诚地合在一道。他伫立殿前久久凝望，念道：“阿弥陀佛！是共产党把西天引渡到咱昆独仑召。”
    ——1956、12、23、京包车上
    昆独仑召在乌拉山下，有三百多年的历史。现在最年长的大喇嘛宁格若鹤，已七十多岁。1956年12月21日我们到召内参观。登殿凭望，见正在兴建中的新包头市，已耸然起立于左前方，工程处的汽车大队就驻在该召附近。听说召内喇嘛对于突然出现在目前的大规模的新建设，很感兴趣。  作者附记
