    This newspaper reports that the more than 14,500 single-ethnicity and multi-ethnicity agricultural cooperatives in Yunnan Province are running well, strengthening ethnic unity and unleashing the production enthusiasm of ethnic minorities. Ethnic minorities account for one-third of the province's population. After cooperativization last year, more than 14,500 single-ethnicity and multi-ethnicity cooperatives were established throughout the province. These agricultural cooperatives have greatly demonstrated the superiority of cooperativization, with over 85% of the cooperatives increasing production and over 86% of the cooperative members increasing their income; some cooperatives saw all members increase their income. In the process of establishing cooperatives, all areas have consistently adhered to the principle of voluntariness, and based on the different characteristics and customs of different ethnic groups, adapted to circumstances, tailored measures to local conditions, and specifically solved specific problems, which has been supported by the ethnic minorities. In Wenshan, Zhaotong, Qujing and other places, in the ethnic joint cooperatives, special attention is paid to ethnic customs, languages, production, and life, emphasizing mutual respect, mutual care, the majority caring for the minority, the advanced helping the backward, and common progress and common improvement. For example, the Hui people do not raise pigs or grow tobacco, and they must pray; the Miao people like couples to work together; and the Miao and Yi people have special hemp ponds, etc. These issues are generally addressed and resolved through democratic consultation among the ethnic groups, based on the principles of developing production and strengthening unity, and under the principle of voluntariness.
    In terms of the operation and management of agricultural cooperatives, consideration is also given to the different situations of the people of all ethnic groups. The leading cadres of the cooperative management committee are produced through democratic consultation based on the proportion of each ethnic group in the cooperative. When forming production teams, it is generally possible to appropriately consider the advanced and backward based on the different characteristics of each ethnic group, and adopt a voluntary combination method to form different production teams and work areas. Some cooperative members do not know how to sow or transplant rice seedlings, some do not know how to grow flue-cured tobacco, and some do not know how to plow the land, so the cooperative assigns tasks according to each person's different strengths. At the same time, actively encourage cooperative members to learn technology, impart technology, and achieve the goal of mutual learning and mutual improvement.
    Agricultural cooperativization has not only brought wealth to people of all ethnic groups, but is also gradually changing people's spiritual outlook. Last year, in Wenshan, Zhaotong, Funing and other counties, due to the instigation of bad elements, creating discord, and inciting Miao and Yao cooperative members to withdraw from the cooperatives, the Miao and Yao cooperative members voluntarily sent those bad elements to the government, requesting the government to punish them according to law. Some cooperative members were temporarily deceived into moving their homes and withdrawing from the cooperatives, but after mass self-education, they quickly realized their mistakes and asked to return to the cooperative. During the rectification and transfer of cooperatives, some ethnic minority cooperative members did not understand the Party's policies and had some ideological concerns, each fearing losses and fearing that they would not be able to engage in labor according to the customs of their own ethnic group. For example, Yao cooperative members have to worship the dragon every July, the Sandu cooperative members are afraid that newly married couples will not be assigned to the same production team, and the Miao people are afraid that they will not be able to perform "Huashan" (a traditional Miao festival), etc. However, the agricultural cooperative appropriately satisfied these requirements of the various ethnic minorities, so their concerns were relieved, and their enthusiasm for production was brought into play. After seeing with their own eyes the benefits that the cooperative movement brought to people of all ethnic groups, some people automatically abandoned backward farming methods and abandoned the habits of killing livestock to worship ghosts and "Wolong" (laying fallow land) that hindered production. The Jingpo, Benglong, Lisu and other fraternal ethnic groups have many taboo days throughout the year. They do not produce on taboo days. Now, the number of taboo days has decreased; on taboo days, some cooperative members still go to the fields to produce as usual. The Benglong people do not rely on livestock to engage in field labor. Cattle and horses are only engaged in light labor, while people bear extremely heavy physical labor. Now, they also use animal power to replace human power.

### 云南各族农民收入增加团结增强  照顾民族特点、坚持自愿原则是办好农业社的关键

    云南各族农民收入增加团结增强
    照顾民族特点、坚持自愿原则是办好农业社的关键
    本报讯　云南省一万四千五百多个单一少数民族社和多民族联合社办得好，增强了民族团结，发挥了少数民族的生产积极性。云南的少数民族人口占全省人口的三分之一。去年合作化以后，全省办起了一万四千五百多个单一少数民族社和多民族的联合社。这些农业社，大大地显示了合作化的优越性，85％以上的社增加了生产，86％以上的社员增加了收入，有的社全体社员都增加了收入。在办社过程中，各地始终坚持着自愿的原则，根据民族不同的特点，不同的风俗习惯，因事制宜、因地制宜，具体问题具体解决，得到了少数民族的拥护。文山、昭通、曲靖等地，在民族联合社中特别注意民族风俗习惯、语言、生产、生活，强调互相尊重，互相照顾，多数照顾少数，先进帮助落后，共同进步，共同提高。如回族不养猪，不种烟，要做礼拜；苗族喜欢夫妇在一起生产；苗、彝族生活特殊用的麻塘地等问题，一般都在自愿的原则下，由各民族经过民主协商，本着发展生产、增强团结的精神加以照顾和解决。
    在农业社的经营管理方面，也根据各民族人民不同的情况给以照顾。社管会的领导干部，是根据各族人民在社内占的比例，经过民主协商产生的。编生产队的时候，一般能按照各民族不同的特长，适当照顾先进和落后，采取自愿结合的办法，编成不同的生产队和作业区。有的社员不会撒秧、插秧，有的社员不会种烤烟，有的社员不会犁地等农业活计，社里就按照各人不同的特长，分配任务。同时，积极鼓励社员学习技术，传授技术，达到互相学习，互相提高的目的。
    农业合作化不仅给各族人民带来了富裕，也逐渐改变着人们的精神面貌。去年，文山、昭通、富宁等县，由于坏分子的挑拨离间，制造不和，煽动苗、瑶族社员闹退社，但是，苗、瑶族社员自动地将那些坏分子送交政府，要求政府依法惩办。有的社员虽然一时被骗搬了家、退了社，经过群众性的自我教育后，就很快地觉悟过来，要求回社。在整社转社时，有的少数民族社员不了解党的政策，有些思想顾虑，他们各自都怕吃亏、怕不能按照本民族的习惯从事劳动。如瑶族社员每年7月要祭龙，沙族社员的新婚夫妇怕不能分在一个生产队，苗族怕不能耍花山等等。但农业社适当地满足了各少数民族的这些要求，于是他们的顾虑解除了，生产积极性发挥了。少数民族亲眼看到了合作化运动给各族人民带来的好处后，有些人自动的放弃了落后的耕作方法，放弃了妨碍生产的杀牲祭鬼和卧龙的习惯。景颇、崩龙、傈僳等兄弟民族，他们一年有许多忌日。在忌日里他们是不生产的。现在，忌日减少了；在忌日里，有些社员仍照常下地生产。崩龙族从事田间劳动是不依靠牲畜的，牛、马只是从事轻微的劳动，而人却担负着极其繁重的体力劳动。现在，他们也使用畜力来代替人力了。
