Our distinguished guests from Czechoslovakia—the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic headed by Premier Široký—left Prague yesterday for Beijing. We extend a warm and brotherly welcome to the distinguished guests on their visit to our country, and we believe that this friendly visit and the talks between the leaders of China and Czechoslovakia will further strengthen the fraternal friendship between our two peoples, the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and promote the development of world peace and the cause of human progress.

The peoples of China and Czechoslovakia have a traditional friendship. Although our two countries are thousands of miles apart, mountains and rivers cannot block the ties of our friendship. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, both our peoples have long fought for national freedom and liberation. In the struggle, our two peoples have always shown deep concern and sympathy for each other. The liberation of Czechoslovakia and the founding of the People's Republic of China have provided excellent conditions for the further development and enhancement of the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Czech peoples. Both of our countries are socialist countries, and we have established brotherly relations of mutual assistance and cooperation due to the consistency of our ideological foundation and goals. In recent years, the political, economic, and cultural relations between the Chinese and Czech peoples have been continuously developing and consolidating. The struggle of the Chinese people to safeguard their national sovereignty, territorial integrity, and legitimate rights has received the consistent support of the Czechoslovak people; the Chinese people have also received significant assistance from the Czechoslovak people in their socialist construction. Czechoslovakia, with its highly developed industry, supplies our country with complete sets of equipment for some power stations and factories, as well as machinery and equipment needed by many industrial sectors; Czech experts with rich construction experience and superb skills are working tirelessly throughout our country to impart advanced experience. All of these are powerful support for our socialist cause. The trade between China and Czechoslovakia is constantly expanding, and the volume of trade in 1956 has increased fivefold compared to 1950. The scientific and technological cooperation between China and Czechoslovakia is playing an important role in the socialist construction of our two countries. The extensive development of cultural exchanges between China and Czechoslovakia has greatly enriched the cultural lives of our two peoples. The frequent exchanges of various delegations between China and Czechoslovakia are a clear sign of the continuous strengthening of the fraternal friendship between our two peoples. Chinese state leaders Vice Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, and the delegation of the National People's Congress of our country headed by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen have visited Czechoslovakia; many leaders of the Czechoslovak Party and government have also visited our country. In recent years, the ever-developing friendly relations between China and Czechoslovakia have written a splendid new chapter in the history of Sino-Czech relations.

The Chinese people are very excited to see that the Czechoslovak people have made tremendous achievements in socialist construction and made important contributions to the struggle for maintaining world peace. In the twelve years since liberation, the Czechoslovak people, under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, have made tremendous progress in political, economic, and cultural fields. Before World War II, Czechoslovakia was one of the most industrially developed countries in Europe. In the era of people's democratic power, Czechoslovakia has developed into a highly technical industrial country, and its total industrial output has ranked sixth or seventh in the world. At present, Czechoslovakia has trade relations with almost all countries in the world. The machinery and equipment it provides to many socialist countries and other economically underdeveloped countries play an important role in the development of these countries' industries. The Czechoslovak people have also made great achievements in developing agriculture. More than 200,000 farmers have now joined approximately 8,000 advanced types of unified agricultural cooperatives. Czechoslovakia's cultural and educational undertakings have also made great progress since liberation. On the basis of economic and cultural development, the material and cultural living standards of the Czechoslovak people have also greatly improved. At present, the Czechoslovak people are concentrating all their efforts to fight for the realization of the Second Five-Year Plan for a higher development of the national economy. While carrying out peaceful construction, Czechoslovakia, together with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, unswervingly pursues a peaceful foreign policy. Czechoslovakia has waged a resolute struggle against the arming of West Germany, the establishment of a European collective security system, the realization of disarmament, and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and has made unremitting efforts to safeguard world peace and develop friendly cooperation among countries. Czechoslovakia's significant efforts in striving for the realization of the Korean armistice and supervising the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement have been praised by peace-loving countries and people in Asia.

Czechoslovakia is an important member of the socialist camp. It develops fraternal relations of mutual assistance and cooperation with all countries in the socialist camp and has always strived to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia has taken a firm stand on the Hungarian issue, supporting the revolutionary forces in Hungary, safeguarding the socialist system in Hungary, supporting the Soviet Union's just assistance to socialist Hungary, and resolutely打击打击 the enemies of socialism's provocations and sabotage activities against the socialist camp. After the Hungarian incident, the Czechoslovak government held talks with Hungary and the Soviet Union successively, and held a five-nation meeting with the Soviet Union, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, making important contributions to strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Today, the unity of Czechoslovakia with all socialist brother countries is constantly strengthening on the basis of proletarian internationalism and the Marxist-Leninist principle of national equality. The continuous strengthening of the unity of socialist countries not only fully conforms to the fundamental interests of the Czechoslovak people, but also fully conforms to the fundamental interests of the people of all socialist countries.

The Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples have forged an eternal and unbreakable fraternal friendship. We are very grateful to the Czechoslovak people for their significant assistance to our socialist construction cause. In socialist construction, our people have learned a lot of advanced experience and technology from the Czechoslovak people, and in the future we will still learn from Czechoslovakia with an open mind. As our Czechoslovak distinguished guests come to visit our country, we wholeheartedly congratulate the fraternal friendship and unity and mutual assistance between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples on becoming more developed and more consolidated.

    欢迎来自捷克斯洛伐克的贵宾
    我国的贵宾——以西罗基总理为首的捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团已于昨日离开布拉格前来北京。我们怀着兄弟般的感情热烈欢迎贵宾们到我国访问，并且相信，这次友好访问和中捷两国领导人的会谈，必将进一步加强我们两国人民的兄弟友谊和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，促进世界和平和人类进步事业的发展。
    中捷两国人民有着传统的友谊。我们两国虽相距万里，但是千山万水都无法阻隔我们友谊的联系。我们两国人民都同样在共产党的领导下，长期地进行了争取民族自由和解放的斗争。在斗争中我们两国人民曾经互相寄与深切的关怀和同情。捷克斯洛伐克的解放和中华人民共和国的成立，使中捷两国人民的传统友谊获得了进一步发扬光大的良好条件。我们两国都是社会主义国家，由于思想基础和奋斗目标的一致，已经建立了兄弟般的互助合作的关系。几年来，中捷两国人民的政治、经济和文化关系不断发展和巩固。我国人民维护祖国主权、领土完整和合法权利的斗争，获得了捷克斯洛伐克人民的一贯支持；我国人民在社会主义建设中，也获得了捷克斯洛伐克人民的重大援助。工业高度发达的捷克斯洛伐克，供给我国建设的一些发电站和工厂的全套设备以及许多工业部门所需要的机器设备；有着丰富的建设经验和技术精湛的捷克斯洛伐克专家们，在我国各地不辞劳苦地传授先进经验。这些都是对我国社会主义事业的有力支持。中捷两国的贸易正在不断扩大，1956年的换货量已增为1950年的五倍。中捷两国的科学技术合作，在我们两国的社会主义建设中发挥着重要的作用。中捷两国文化交流的广泛发展，大大丰富了我们两国人民的文化生活。中捷两国之间各种代表团的频繁往来，是我们两国人民兄弟友谊不断加强的鲜明标志。我国国家领导人朱德副主席、周恩来总理和以彭真副委员长为首的我国全国人民代表大会代表团曾经访问过捷克斯洛伐克；捷克斯洛伐克党和政府的许多领导人也访问过我国。几年来，中捷两国之间日益发展的友好关系，在中捷关系史上已写下了灿烂的新的篇章。
    中国人民十分兴奋地看到，捷克斯洛伐克人民已在社会主义建设中取得巨大的成就，并在维护世界和平的斗争中作出了重要的贡献。在解放后的十二年中，捷克斯洛伐克人民在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下，在政治、经济和文化方面都有了巨大的发展。捷克斯洛伐克在第二次世界大战前就是欧洲工业发达的国家之一，在人民民主政权年代，捷克斯洛伐克已经发展成为具有高度技术的工业国家，它的工业总产量已占世界第六、七位。目前，捷克斯洛伐克实际上同世界各国都有了贸易关系，它向许多社会主义国家和其他经济不发达国家提供的机器设备，对于这些国家工业的发展起着重要的作用。捷克斯洛伐克人民在发展农业方面也取得了很大的成绩，现在已有二十多万农户参加了大约八千个高级类型的统一农业合作社。捷克斯洛伐克的文化教育事业在解放后也取得了巨大的发展。在经济和文化的发展的基础上，捷克斯洛伐克人民的物质和文化生活水平也有了很大的提高。目前，捷克斯洛伐克人民正在集中一切力量，为实现更高地发展国民经济的第二个五年计划而斗争。在进行和平建设的同时，捷克斯洛伐克同苏联和其他社会主义国家一起，坚持不渝地奉行着和平外交政策。捷克斯洛伐克为反对武装西德、建立欧洲集体安全制度、实现裁军和禁止原子武器进行了坚决的斗争，为维护世界和平和发展各国的友好合作进行了不懈的努力。捷克斯洛伐克在争取实现朝鲜停战和监督朝鲜停战协定的执行方面所作的重大努力，获得了亚洲爱好和平的国家和人民的称颂。
    捷克斯洛伐克是社会主义阵营中的重要的一员，它同社会主义阵营各国发展着兄弟般的互助合作关系，并且一向为加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结而努力。捷克斯洛伐克在匈牙利问题上采取了坚定的立场，支持匈牙利的革命势力，维护匈牙利的社会主义制度，支持苏联对于社会主义匈牙利的正义援助，坚决打击社会主义的敌人对社会主义阵营的挑拨和破坏活动。在匈牙利事件以后，捷克斯洛伐克政府曾先后同匈牙利和苏联举行了会谈，并同苏联、匈牙利、罗马尼亚和保加利亚举行了五国会谈，对加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结作出了重要的贡献。今天，捷克斯洛伐克在无产阶级国际主义原则和马克思列宁主义民族平等原则的基础上，同各个社会主义兄弟国家的团结正在不断地加强。社会主义国家团结的不断加强，这不仅完全符合捷克斯洛伐克人民的根本利益，而且也完全符合一切社会主义国家人民的根本利益。
    中捷两国人民已结成了永恒的牢不可破的兄弟友谊。我们十分感谢捷克斯洛伐克人民对我国社会主义建设事业的重大援助。我国人民在社会主义建设中，曾向捷克斯洛伐克人民学习到不少先进的经验和技术，今后我们仍然要虚心地向捷克斯洛伐克学习。当我们的捷克斯洛伐克贵宾们前来我国访问的时候，我们衷心地祝贺中捷两国人民之间的兄弟友谊和团结互助，更加发展，更加巩固。
