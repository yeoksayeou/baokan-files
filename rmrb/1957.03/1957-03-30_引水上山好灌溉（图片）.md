　　Drawing Water Uphill for Good Irrigation

　　In Mancheng County, a mountainous area of Hebei Province, agricultural cooperatives in various townships are planning to draw river water to irrigate farmland, so that high-yield crops such as rice can also be grown in the mountains. After the plan is implemented, Jing Shan Township alone will be able to irrigate 1,500 mu of rice paddies this spring, which can increase rice production by 400,000 jin. The canal construction project is now underway.

　　引水上山好灌溉
    河北省山区的满城县，各乡农业社计划引用河水灌溉农田，使山区也能种上高产作物——水稻。计划实现后，仅荆山乡今春就能灌溉一千五百亩稻田，可增产稻谷四十万斤。现在开渠工程正在紧张地进行着。
