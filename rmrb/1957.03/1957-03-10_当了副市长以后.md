Wang Yiming said: An old friend asked me if I had power and authority after becoming the vice mayor? I feel that I cannot say that I have a position without power, but rather I should examine myself to see if I am fulfilling my duties and responsibilities. Position and power are consistent, and power is formed in the process of actively engaging in work.

After the entire industry was jointly owned by public and private interests, industrialists and businessmen were properly arranged according to the principle of appropriate consideration based on their talents. Everyone took on new jobs with a sense of excitement, but new problems also emerged, namely, the issue of having a position and power. Some felt that their level was low and their talent was insufficient, and they were hesitant about how to fulfill their duties and responsibilities. Some also had doubts about the issue of having a position and power. Therefore, I would like to express my personal experiences on how non-Party members, especially industrialists and businessmen, should correctly understand having a position and power and how to fulfill their duties and responsibilities after being assigned positions, and I ask for your guidance, committee members.

I was elected as the Vice Mayor of the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee in December 1956. Wuhan is a key industrial base under construction and a large city with a population of over two million. Therefore, the position of Vice Mayor is a very important and highly responsible one. When I returned to Wuhan from Beijing, my comrades congratulated me. I felt very sudden and didn't know how to respond. On the one hand, I felt happy, and on the other hand, I felt fear.

Why happy? Before liberation, I was only running a private joint venture flour mill. In the then Hankou Municipal Industrial Association, I couldn't even be a standing director. Therefore, the role I could play was very limited. Since liberation, under the cultivation of the Party, I have participated in the leadership of several large enterprises. Now the Party and the people give me infinite trust and entrust me with such a big task. I can put forward my opinions to enterprises throughout the city. Compared with my previous management of a flour mill, it is hundreds, thousands, or many times greater. In terms of the scope of work, this is really a great fortune. Having such an opportunity to contribute any kind of strength to socialist construction makes me feel extremely happy.

Why fear? In handling many things, it has proven that my ability is very weak. Even if I can play a certain role among industrialists and businessmen, it is spontaneous rather than self-conscious. Even if there is a little contribution, compared with the contributions of the workers, it is truly what is called "a drop in the bucket." Such a high position seems disproportionate to me. The position is so high and the responsibility is so heavy, so I feel very scared.

The question in my mind is how to do the work. After thinking it over, the solution I came up with was to consult with all parties, first of all, to consult with Party comrades. The leading comrades mostly gave me encouragement first and instructed me to contact the masses more. I also consulted with many comrades. They also told me from the standpoint of encouragement that if I obeyed the leadership, things could be done well. I felt that without specific instructions and help, it seemed that I had not reached my requirements. I carefully combined it with the examples of my handling of problems to think about it. My problem lies in not truly obeying the leadership and being separated from the masses. After this process, I came to the conclusion that I should take the path of relying on the masses. The first thing I did was to invite the Municipal People's Representatives from the Democratic National Construction Association and the business community, as well as the cadres who worked most closely with me, to give me their opinions.

Before inviting them to the discussion, I had two concerns in my mind. First, I have always been arrogant and not used to accepting other people's opinions. Would everyone be willing to help me frankly? Second, because I usually don't contact the masses, if I "cram at the last minute," what should I do if everyone can't give me a way out? But to improve work ability and improve work methods, there is no better way than to take the mass line. A total of three discussions were held. After the three discussions, it proved that my thinking was lagging behind the masses, and the result was very rewarding.

At the beginning of the discussion, I explained to the representatives the recent work of the Municipal People's Committee, and then put forward some of my own shortcomings that I felt, and then asked everyone to point out my shortcomings. Why did I expose my own shortcomings first? Because if I don't mention it first, others may be embarrassed to mention it and can't break through the human feelings. At the same time, I mentioned this point, which can lead to many points. Exposing the shortcomings that I have already realized can lead to some shortcomings that I have not realized. The representatives first believed that the method of taking the mass line in such a discussion was good, but this spirit should be carried through to the end and not be half-hearted. At the same time, they said that this method has a demonstration effect on them. They expressed satisfaction with the report of the work of the Municipal People's Committee and believed that it is necessary to inform the representatives of the work center of the Municipal People's Committee at any time so that they can cooperate with the masses in doing their work.

The analysis of my personal shortcomings was realistic and comprehensive, summarized into six points:

一、Not serious in important meetings. Presiding over meetings without preparation before the meeting, not listening to the speeches of the masses, especially not paying attention to the speeches that disagree with my own opinions, not grasping the key points in the summary, and the summary is not comprehensive.

二、Not bold and not careful in work.

三、Making hasty and one-sided instructions, making it difficult for the subordinates to carry out their work.

四、The attitude is blunt, making the masses unwilling to approach.

五、The sense of personal heroism is very strong.

六、Work is not in-depth and not thorough.

These six points are completely correct. The attitude is sincere, the spirit is serious, and it starts from support, which makes me grateful and ashamed. The situation at the time was like this: one comrade after another put forward opinions, and also affirmed the advantages while pointing out the shortcomings. They raised it, and I wrote it down. When they pointed out the shortcomings, my hands were recording, my face was flushed, and I was sweating. They not only pointed out the shortcomings, but also pointed out the methods of correction. I made a comprehensive record of everyone's opinions, and decided to explain it to the representatives at the next symposium, and use the facts to explain how those points were corrected. After the symposium, I made a summary of sixteen characters as a guideline for future work. The sixteen characters are: obey the leadership; rely on the masses; be careful and bold; make subjective efforts.

Obey the leadership. Obeying the leadership means handling affairs according to policies and guidelines, and sincerely serving the socialist cause, and striving to focus on the central task of increasing production and practicing economy as instructed by the municipal party committee.

Rely on the masses. Relying on the masses means analyzing the opinions put forward by the masses, accepting the opinions of the masses, and solving the problems of the masses that can be solved. Under the maintenance of national and people's interests, representing the legitimate interests of industrialists and businessmen and reflecting reasonable opinions. Using correcting shortcomings as a means to win over the masses' opinions, and using a humble attitude as a method to connect with the masses, frequently inviting discussions and asking everyone to put forward opinions to enrich themselves.

Be careful and bold. When studying problems, try to consider the relevant aspects as much as possible, and when handling problems, let go and be bold when reflecting reasonable opinions.

Subjective efforts. Subjective efforts are the actions of obeying the leadership and relying on the masses. The ideas understood in thought cannot stay in the mind, but must be acted upon to strive for leadership and strive for work, instead of sitting and waiting for leadership and waiting for work to be assigned. On the one hand, do not be afraid of being rejected, and on the other hand, there must be no intention of perfunctorily relaxing. Require yourself to be strict, and require others to be in line with human feelings and the possibility of development. Correct mistakes immediately, and raise opinions immediately.

Below are two experiences:

1.  Experience of having a position and power. This time I went to Beijing, and an old friend asked me, "Do you have a position and power after you become the vice mayor?" Because I didn't have this impression in my mind, I couldn't answer it at once. I felt that I couldn't say that I had a position without power, but I should examine myself to see if I was fulfilling my duties and responsibilities. Position and power are consistent, and power is formed in the process of actively engaging in work. For example, a new employee in a store must first do some work. The manager sees your ability, and then gradually gives you important and more important positions. How did I, along with another vice mayor, work in charge of industry, commerce, and socialist transformation? If I wanted to invite someone to talk about a problem, I would call and invite them to talk. If I wanted to go to a bureau to understand the situation, I would go to understand. If they put forward correct opinions, I would support them. If I saw something that I agreed with, I would bring it up to them for consideration. I would ask everything I should ask. I felt that if it was correct, I would patiently raise it again and again. The facts proved that some things were agreed to after being raised once, and some were only able to meet my requirements after being raised again and again. Because others also have a process of accepting opinions, initiative and patience are very necessary. This is how I did it, and I didn't feel like I had no power. In my experience, power must be actively striven for in work, and it is not a question of whether someone gives it or not. Starting from the spirit of serving the people, why worry about not having power? (Of course, some units do not respect non-Party members enough in specific matters, which needs to be solved from both sides.)

2.  Experience of arrangement and consideration. My position is so high, which is obviously a kind of consideration. Can I say that consideration is a policy, so I can rest assured and "hold a position without doing any work"? Do I think that I have representation and eat the trademark rice like a trademark? This is very dishonorable, and it makes the Party very passive. What is the right way to do it? On the basis of consideration, strengthen learning, improve one's own work level, and gradually and basically achieve being worthy of the name, so as not to fail the Party's cultivation and consideration.

Committee members and comrades, in the very difficult situation of socialist construction in the country, my treatment is very generous. I have a dedicated car, I have a dedicated telephone, etc. I calculate it, how many farmers can support me alone? Workers and farmers are creating wealth for socialist construction. What am I doing? How much wealth am I creating? The problem is not to study the government's generous treatment of me, but to contribute all my strength, contribute my bit of strength. I, who accepted redemption, must understand the spirit of sacrifice of the working class. They are starting from building a socialist society. I feel that there is no need to talk empty words, actively act, learn from the working class, and strive for the cause of socialist construction selflessly! (Attached picture)

### 当了副市长以后

专栏：

    当了副市长以后
    王一鸣说：有一位老朋友问我当了副市长是不是有职有权？我觉得不能说有职无权，而是要反求诸己，是不是守职尽责，职与权是一致的，而权，是要在主动的搞工作中形成的。
    全行业公私合营以后，工商业者在量才使用适当照顾的原则下，都得到妥善的安排，大家都以感奋的心情走上新的工作岗位，但是又出现了新问题。即关于有职有权的问题。有的感到水平低了，才能不够，如何做到守职尽责，有些徬徨，也有的在有职有权问题上有些怀疑。因此，我想就非党人士，特别是工商业者在被安排以后，如何来正确的认识有职有权，如何做到守职尽责，发表个人的体会，请各位委员指教。
    我于1956年12月当选为武汉市人民委员会副市长，武汉市是一个重点建设的工业基地，是有二百万人口以上的大城市，因之，副市长是一个责任很重大很高的位置。当我由北京回到武汉市的时候，同志们向我道贺，我感觉得很突然，不知道如何答复才好。我一方面感觉得欢欣，一方面感觉得恐惧。
    为什么欢欣呢？在未解放以前，我只是搞一个私人合资的面粉厂，在当时的汉口市工业协会，当不上一位常务理事，因之能够发生的作用是有很大的局限性。解放以来，在党的培养下，参加了几个大企业的领导层，现在党和人民给我以无限的信任，交给我这样大的任务，我能向全市的企业提出我的意见，同我以前管理一个面粉厂来比较，不知道要大几百倍，几千倍，若干倍，在工作范围来说这一下子真是发了大财了。有这样的机会，能为社会主义建设贡献出任何一种力量，这使我感觉得万分的欢欣。
    为什么恐惧呢？在我处理许多事情中，证明我的能力是十分薄弱的，即令说到在工商业者中起到某些作用，只是自发的，而不是自为的，即令有点滴的贡献，同工人同志的贡献来作比较，真是所谓“九牛一毛，沧海一粟”，这样高的位置对于我似不相衬的，位置这样高责任这样重，因之我感觉得十分的恐惧。
    问题摆在我脑筋中的是怎样来搞工作，想来想去，想出来的办法是向各方面请教，首先是向党的同志请教。领导同志们对于我多半是首先鼓励一番指示我要多联系群众，我又向许多同志们请教，他们同样的从鼓励出发告诉我服从领导，事情就可以办得好，我觉得没有具体的指示和帮助，似乎没有达到我的要求。我仔细的结合我处理问题的事例来想一想，我的毛病就出在不实实在在的服从领导和脱离群众这两个问题上。经过这一过程得出这样的结论，我就决定走依靠群众的路线。首先是邀请民主建国会和工商界的市人民代表，以及同我工作最密切的干部同志们向我提意见。
    在未邀请座谈之前，思想上有两种顾虑，第一是：我一向是自高自大，不习惯于接受别人的意见，大家愿不愿意直率的帮助我呢？第二是：由于平时不联系群众“临时抱佛脚”大家给我下不了台如何办呢？但是要提高工作能力，改进工作方法，除了走群众路线以外是没有更好的办法的。共座谈三次。三次的座谈以后，证明了我的思想落后于群众，结果收获是很大的。
    座谈开始，我向代表们说明了最近市人民委员会的工作情况以后，提出我自己所感觉得到的自己的一些缺点，然后要求大家提我的缺点。为什么自己先揭露自己的缺点呢？因为自己不先提，别人就可能不好意思提，揭不破人情观点。同时我提了这一点，就可以引出许多点，揭露了我自己已经体会到的缺点，就可以引出我所没有认识到的若干缺点来。代表们首先认为座谈这样的走群众路线的办法是好的，但是这种精神要贯串下去，不要有始无终，同时他们说这样的办法对他们有示范的作用，对于报告市人民委员会的工作，表示满意，认为随时使代表们了解市人民委员会工作中心，以便他们好在群众中配合的搞工作。
    对于我个人的缺点实事求是加以分析，综合为六点：
    一、开重要会议不严肃。主持会议，会议前不作准备，不倾听群众的发言，尤其不重视不同自己意见的发言，总结时抓不着重点，总结得不全面。
    二、工作上既不大胆，又不小心。
    三、轻率的作出片面性的指示，使下面不好进行工作。
    四、态度生硬，使群众不愿意接近。
    五、个人英雄主义的意味十分浓厚。
    六、工作不深入，不彻底。
    这六点是完全正确的，态度是诚恳的，精神是认真的，是从支持出发的，使我感激，使我惭愧。当时的情况是这样的，提意见的同志一位接着一位，提缺点也肯定优点。他们提，我就写，当他们指出缺点的时候，我的手在记，脸上在发烧，身上在出汗。他们，不只是提出缺点而且指出改正的方法，我将大家的意见作出综合的记载，决定在下次座谈会上，向代表们作说明，并且用事实说明那几点是如何改正的。座谈以后，概括的作出十六个字的总结，作为今后的工作方针，十六个字就是：服从领导；依靠群众；小心大胆；主观努力。
    服从领导。服从领导就是根据政策方针办事，诚恳的为社会主义事业服务，根据市委所指示的增产节约的中心工作努力。
    依靠群众。依靠群众就是分析群众提出的意见，接受群众的意见，解决可能解决的群众的问题。在维护国家和人民利益下，代表工商业者的合法利益，反映合理的意见。用改正缺点作为争取群众提意见的手段，用谦虚的态度，作为联系群众的方法，经常的邀请座谈，请大家提意见来丰富自己。
    小心大胆。研究问题时要尽可能的考虑到有关的方面，处理问题时就要放手，反映合理的意见时要大胆。
    主观努力。主观努力是服从领导和依靠群众的行动。思想上体会到的不能够停留在脑筋中，要行动起来，争取领导，争取工作，而不是坐待领导，听候分配工作。一方面不怕碰钉子，另一方面不能有丝毫的敷衍松懈的意图，要求自己要严格，要求别人要合乎人情，合乎发展的可能性，有错误马上就改，有意见即刻就提。
    下面有两点体会：
    1、有职有权的体会。这一次我到了北京，有一位老朋友问我，“你当了副市长是不是有职有权？”由于我脑筋中没有这个印象，我一下答复不出来，我觉得不能说有职无权，而是要反求诸己，是不是守职尽责，职与权是一致的，而权，是要在主动的搞工作中形成的。例如说一个新进店的职员，必须先作一些工作，经理看到了你的能力，然后逐步逐步的交给你重要的更重要的职务。我同另一位副市长分工主管工业商业和社会主义改造，我是怎样作的呢？我想要请那一位来谈问题，我就打电话请来谈，我想到那一个局去了解情况，我就去了解，他们提出正确的意见，我就支持他，我见得到的向他们提出来请他们考虑，我应当问的我都问。我感觉得是对的，我耐心的一提再提，事实证明，有的事情，一提就同意了，有的是经过一再提出然后才达到我的要求的。因为别人接受意见也是有过程的，所以主动与耐心是很必要的。我是这样的作法，不感觉没有权的状况。我的体会，权，是要自己主动的在工作上争取，而不是谁给不给的问题，从为人民服务的精神出发，何患乎无权。（当然有些单位对非党人士的尊重不够的具体事情，这要从两方面来解决。）
    2、对安排照顾的体会。我的位置这样高，这显然是一种照顾，是不是可以说照顾是政策，我就安于照顾而“尸位素餐”呢？是不是认为我有代表性同商标一样吃商标的饭呢？这样就十分的不光荣，这样就使得党十分被动。怎样才对呢？要在照顾的基础上，加强学习，提高自己的工作水平，逐步逐步的基本上做到名符其实，这样才不辜负党的培养和照顾。
    各位委员、各位同志，国家在社会主义建设十分艰难的状况下，我的待遇是十分优厚的，我有专用汽车，我有专用电话，等等，我盘算盘算，多少位农民才能供给我一个人呢？工人农民在为社会主义建设创造财富，我在干什么？我创造多少财富呢？问题不在于研究政府对我的优厚待遇，问题在于如何的贡献出自己的一切力量，贡献自己的点滴力量，接受赎买的我，要体会工人阶级的牺牲精神，他们是从建设社会主义社会出发，我觉得不须要多讲空话，积极的行动起来，向工人阶级学习，为社会主义建设事业而忘我的奋斗吧！（附图片）
