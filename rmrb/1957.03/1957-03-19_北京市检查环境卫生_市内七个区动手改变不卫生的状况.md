    Beijing Inspects Environmental Sanitation
    Seven Districts in the City Take Action to Change Unhygienic Conditions

    (Our newspaper reports) The Beijing Patriotic Health Movement Committee organized seven inspection teams, which inspected environmental sanitation in the seven districts of the city on March 6th and 7th. They found that the environmental sanitation situation was very poor. Some streets that were the responsibility of residents to sweep were not regularly kept clean, and some places were not swept at all. Some government organizations, institutions, and joint state-private enterprises did not clean the areas in front of their doors and the sections they were responsible for. Some of the main roads that were the responsibility of the district cleaning teams to sweep were also not thoroughly cleaned. The situation of pedestrians littering fruit peels on the streets and animal-drawn carts leaving animal excrement along the streets was still very serious. Some sewage pools on the streets often contained onion skins and vegetable leaves, blocking the sewage pools and causing dirty water to overflow. Some citizens even poured sewage outside the pools.

    Many units do not comply with the garbage collection and transportation system, putting out garbage bins very early, attracting many people who pick up coal cinders and waste paper. This not only causes the streets to be dirty and messy, but also affects the collection and transportation work of sanitation workers. Since the launch of the spring patriotic health movement throughout the city on March 10th, the residents' committees in various streets have actively reorganized and improved health organizations, mobilized and organized residents to clean up garbage, dig and smash fly pupae, clean up snow, and rectify environmental sanitation. The unhygienic situation has begun to change. The municipal and district patriotic health movement committees will conduct a major health inspection.

    北京市检查环境卫生
    市内七个区动手改变不卫生的状况
    本报讯　北京市爱国卫生运动委员会组织了七个检查组，在3月6日和7日分别到城内七个区检查环境卫生情况，发现环境卫生状况很不好。有些由住户负责打扫的街道不能经常保持清洁，有些地方甚至根本不打扫。有些机关单位和公私合营商店不清扫门前和应负责清扫的地段。由各区清洁队负责清扫的主要干路，也有些打扫得不彻底。行人在街道上乱扔果皮，兽力车沿街遗落兽粪的情况仍很严重。有些街道上的污水池内经常有葱皮、菜叶，堵塞污水池，脏水外溢，有些市民还把污水倒在池外。
    很多单位不遵守垃圾收运制度，很早就把垃圾箱抬出来，招来许多拣拾煤核、破纸的人，这样，不仅造成街道脏乱，也影响了清洁工人的收运工作。3月10日，全市范围内开展春季爱国卫生运动以来，各街道居民委员会积极重新健全卫生组织，动员和组织居民清理垃圾、挖砸蝇蛹、清扫积雪、整顿环境卫生，不卫生的情况开始有了转变。市、区爱国卫生运动委员会将进行卫生大检查。
