Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The person in charge of the Ministry of Health today made a statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters on the issue of carrying out birth control work.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Health said: The contraceptive devices and medicines that have already been promoted will be expanded in production and improved in quality in the future. The variety of contraceptive drugs and devices will also be increased. Some are being researched and trial-produced, and some are undergoing clinical trials. Once experiments prove that they are safe, convenient, and effective, they will be introduced for use immediately.

Many hospitals and women's health institutions in various cities have established services to guide contraception techniques. Provincial and municipal health departments plan to train intermediate-level health personnel to go deep into small cities and county towns to provide contraception technique guidance.

The person in charge said that strengthening the publicity work on contraception is a key to doing a good job in birth control, and this work should be carried out in various ways. Some cities, such as Shenyang, Jinan, Taiyuan, and Qinhuangdao, have held contraception exhibitions. Beijing will hold a large-scale contraception exhibition on "March 8th" Women's Day. The Ministry of Health's Propaganda Department has compiled small picture books "Before and After Contraception" and "Contraception Guidance Manual", slides, etc., with a large circulation, and will be handed over to the Science Popularization Publishing House for mass distribution in the future. Contraception models and films are being manufactured and will soon be available to medical institutions in various provinces and cities for use in guiding contraception techniques.

The person in charge said that the contraception publicity work is still far from sufficient, especially in the vast rural areas. Rural women have an urgent need for birth control, but do not understand contraception methods. Some people deliberately engage in heavy labor when they are pregnant, or take abortion drugs indiscriminately, which has a very bad impact on their health. At present, many people still have many ideological concerns and incorrect understandings about birth control. For example, they do not believe in the effectiveness of contraception; they worry that the use of contraceptive tools and drugs will affect their health and sexual life; some people are afraid of trouble and do not use contraception, regardless of the adverse effects that too many children bring to the family, the children themselves, and even national construction; some women are shy and dare not talk about contraception or accept contraception guidance; some people have superstitious ideas, believing that the number of children a woman has is predestined, and contraception is a moral deficiency, and so on. The person in charge pointed out that when publicizing contraception, attention should be paid to breaking these unnecessary concerns and incorrect ideological understandings of the masses, properly explaining the policies, and carefully introducing the methods.

The person in charge said that ligation of the fallopian tubes and vas deferens is a safe and reliable method of long-lasting contraception and will not affect sexual function and physical health. Medical units should perform such operations according to the circumstances for those with many children who request them. In the past, due to preference for sons over daughters, people generally only knew about ligation of the fallopian tubes and did not know about ligation of the vas deferens. In the future, more promotion should be given to ligation of the vas deferens, because this operation is simple.

### 为了国家、家庭和后代的利益  要广泛提倡节制生育  卫生部门正加强避孕指导和宣传

    为了国家、家庭和后代的利益
    要广泛提倡节制生育
    卫生部门正加强避孕指导和宣传
    新华社2日讯  卫生部负责人今天就开展节育工作问题对新华社记者发表谈话。
    卫生部负责人说：已经推广的避孕器具和药品，今后将扩大产量并改进质量。避孕药物和器具，还要增加品种，有的正在研究试制，有的正在进行临床实验。一旦实验证明确实安全、方便有效，当即介绍使用。
    各城市有许多医院和妇女保健机构已设立指导避孕技术的业务。省市卫生部门计划训练中级卫生人员，让他们深入到小城市和县城里去进行避孕技术指导。
    负责人说，加强避孕的宣传工作，是搞好节育工作的一个关键，这个工作应该通过各种方式进行。有些城市如沈阳、济南、太原、秦皇岛等，已举办过避孕展览会。北京市将在“三八”妇女节举办大型的避孕展览会。卫生部宣传处编制的小画册“避孕前后”和“避孕指导手册”、幻灯片等，发行量很大，今后还要交科学普及出版社大量发行。避孕模型和电影片正在制造，不久可供给各省市医疗机构在指导避孕技术时应用。
    负责人说，避孕宣传工作还做得很不够，特别是在广大农村中。农村妇女对节育要求很迫切，但不懂得避孕方法。有的人怀了孩子，就故意参加重劳动，或乱服堕胎药物，对身体健康影响很不好。现在许多群众对节育还有很多思想顾虑和不正确认识。例如不相信避孕的效果；担心使用避孕工具和药物会影响健康和性生活；有的人怕麻烦而不避孕，不顾子女太多给家庭、子女本身以至国家建设带来的不利；有些妇女怕羞，不敢谈避孕，不敢接受避孕指导；有些人有迷信思想，认为妇女孩子生的多少，是命中注定的，避孕是缺德的事，等等。负责人指出，宣传避孕时要注意打破群众这些不必要的顾虑和不正确的思想认识，好好交代政策，仔细介绍方法。
    负责人说，结扎输卵管和输精管，是安全可靠的持久性避孕方法，不会影响性机能和身体健康。凡子女多而要求进行这种手术的，医疗单位应该按情况进行手术。过去由于重男轻女，一般人只知道结扎输卵管，不知道结扎输精管。今后要多提倡结扎输精管。因为这种手术简便。
