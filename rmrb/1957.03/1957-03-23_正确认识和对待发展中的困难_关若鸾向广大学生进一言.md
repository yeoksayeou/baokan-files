Correctly Understand and Treat Difficulties in Development
Guan Ruoluan Offers a Word to the Broad Student Body

I work with students, and now I would like to express some opinions on how the broad student body should understand and treat the difficulties in the process of national construction.

Let's Recall the Experiences of Students in the Kuomintang's Reign

When mentioning this issue, I cannot help but recall the situation of students' lives and struggles in the Kuomintang-controlled areas before the national liberation. Ten years ago, the Kuomintang reactionaries were concentrating all their efforts on carrying out an anti-people civil war and further intensified the persecution of patriots and young students. Many students who loved the motherland were arrested and massacred. The Kuomintang reactionary government used 80% of its financial expenditure for military expenses, and the education expenditure was less than 1%. The students' learning conditions were naturally very poor, and their lives were extremely miserable. Take the students' food and health conditions as an example. The students ate moldy and stinky "cheap rice." The so-called government-funded students only had the equivalent of two and a half fried dough sticks for their daily vegetable money. Due to severe malnutrition and extremely poor school sanitation facilities, the incidence of lung disease among college students at that time reached more than one-tenth, and in some schools even reached one-fourth. At that time, a saying was popular among students: "First year buy candles, second year buy glasses, third year buy spittoons, fourth year buy coffins." College graduates suffered the pain of "graduation equals unemployment." I remember that at that time, unemployed college graduates often set up stalls in Nanjing's Xin Jie Kou and other places to sell old clothes and old books; some students were fortunate enough to find jobs, but they could only serve a small number of ruling classes as employees. The broad masses of students realized that in order to build a free and happy New China, they must closely link their struggles with the national people's revolutionary struggles, share the same breath and destiny with the national people. On May 20, 1947, students in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, and other places, under the leadership of the Communist Party, inherited and carried forward the glorious revolutionary traditions of the "May Fourth," "December 9th," and "December 1st" movements, shouted the slogans of "anti-hunger, anti-civil war, anti-persecution," and waged heroic and tenacious struggles against the Kuomintang reactionaries.

Today, the students' situation has undergone fundamental changes, and the great socialist construction of the motherland has shown the students of our country an infinitely bright future. The greatest happiness our students feel is: learning our skills well, no longer working as slaves for a few people, but serving the people and building a prosperous and happy motherland with our hard work.

Let's Compare Our Lives with Those of Students in Capitalist Countries

In order to cultivate talents for construction, the People's Government has made its greatest efforts to develop education on the basis of the dilapidated economy left over from the old China. Taking universities as an example, the current number of students has reached 403,000, an increase of nearly three times compared with the year with the largest number of students before liberation (1946); in the past seven years, the number of university graduates is equivalent to 1.3 times the number of graduates in the 36 years before liberation (1912-1947); in the past seven years, universities have built more than 7 million square meters of school buildings, and this construction area is more than 1 million square meters more than that from the Reform Movement of 1898 during the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty to the liberation in 1949; all students enjoy government-funded medical treatment, and the vast majority of students enjoy scholarships; the government has also implemented the educational policy of opening the door to workers and peasants, and students of worker and peasant origin in universities account for one-third of all students. Today, Chinese students, whether in terms of political status or spiritual life, are incomparable to students in capitalist countries. Last year, French Paris University students Anatole and Amette Ralaki told me that only one-tenth of the students at Paris University can live on campus, and boarders have to pay about 3,000 francs a month for rent; very few college students enjoy scholarships, and less than 2% are children of workers and peasants; most students have to work part-time while studying, some as teachers, some as waiters in hotels, and some as nannies; many students drop out of school due to economic difficulties. For example, in Anatole's geography department, there were 252 people in the first grade; while in the third grade, there were only 45 people left. According to the statistical data in the "Japan Education Yearbook," about 36% of Japanese college students have to rely on part-time work, and about 70% require part-time work. The working hours of part-time students generally account for 11-80 hours per month, and some even reach 160 hours; employment for college graduates is also very difficult. I remember three years ago, relevant Japanese personnel wrote to the All-China Students' Federation, saying that tens of thousands of college graduates could not find jobs at that time, and many people asked to come to our country to work.

We Should Recognize the Difficulties in Development and Correctly Treat Difficulties

Of course, our country has only been built for seven years, and our country still has many difficulties, and our schools also have many difficulties, such as the rapid development of schools, and the construction of school buildings cannot keep up, so school buildings are certainly more crowded; the number of students has increased, and the number of teachers is not enough. At present, young teachers account for more than 60%, and the teaching quality of many of them cannot meet the requirements; in addition, there are still many difficulties in teaching equipment, teaching materials, and so on. Even after graduating and going to work, you will encounter various difficulties. Will we have no difficulties or avoid difficulties? That is absolutely impossible. Our victory today was obtained after overcoming many difficulties. We will constantly encounter more difficulties today and tomorrow. Only by overcoming these difficulties can we achieve greater victories. There will always be difficulties. The question is how to correctly treat difficulties.

Currently, there are two different attitudes towards difficulties among students. One attitude is to demand that the country arrange everything properly for them, otherwise they will passively complain. Obviously, this is not the attitude of a master of the country, but rather to regard oneself as the "young master" in the revolutionary family. It is difficult to imagine that such people will be able to shoulder the heavy responsibility of building socialism and communism in the future. At the same time, this kind of thinking is also unrealistic. It should be noted that the country's financial expenditure in 1955 only increased five times compared with 1949, but the education expenditure in 1955 has increased 28 times compared with before liberation, and the country's cultural and educational expenditure in 1956 increased by 26.3% compared with 1955. The country spends 8,000 yuan to train a college student (scholarships and other expenses are not included). If we still demand that the country increase education expenditure, take care of everything, and demand everything with the highest standards, and make everything comfortable, this will inevitably affect the country's economic construction, and this is also detrimental to the highest and long-term interests of the people and students of the whole country.

The other attitude is: to help the country overcome difficulties diligently and thriftily with the attitude of a master. Chairman Mao taught us: "Victory is achieved in the struggle against difficulties. The youth of New China must be prepared to overcome all difficulties." Our predecessors overcame countless difficulties in the past revolutionary struggles before achieving today's glorious victory. To inherit their cause, we must first learn from their loyalty to the revolutionary cause and their spirit of not being afraid of difficulties. We must not only recognize the country's difficulties with a correct attitude, but also overcome difficulties with the attitude of a master. Some students in some schools are doing just that. They regard it as their unshirkable responsibility to solve the problems they can solve themselves. For example, when the Northwest Russian Language College started this semester, some school buildings were not repaired, so the students used their spare time to carry out voluntary labor to help build the school; Qinghua University students, in the metalworking internship, changed the past situation of complete consumption since August last year and produced a batch of products for the country. Up to now, 300 Soviet-style water pumps have been manufactured, worth about 63,300 yuan. Some of these water pumps have been sent to Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Baotou Iron and Steel Company, and other places for use. The students of Xi'an Aviation Academy actively responded to the call for increasing production and practicing economy, and put forward slogans such as "Do not waste a degree of electricity, a drop of water, or a grain of rice, and do not casually ask the country for subsidies." They saved 3,000 kilograms of grain in half a month. These examples are too numerous to mention. These actions of the students not only helped the school overcome some difficulties, but also cultivated their views of "thinking of the people in everything," "labor is glorious," and the style of hard work and simplicity in practice. Many of our university graduates have also consciously asked to work in places with the most difficulties and the harshest environments. For example, this year, the graduates of Beijing Agricultural Mechanization College actively signed up to go to the arduous Great Northern Wilderness for reclamation; the graduates of the Geological Exploration College often braved the wind and rain and the scorching sun, and conducted exploration in uninhabited places day and night. They were filled with joy and pride, singing this song: "It is the wind in the valley that blows our red flag, it is the violent rain that washes our tents, we have the passion of flames, overcoming fatigue and cold, carrying our luggage, climbing the layers of mountain peaks, we are full of infinite hope, to find rich mineral deposits for the country." Comrades, this is the heroic spirit of the young students of our country in the face of hardships and difficulties. The reason why they can do this is that they regard it as their greatest happiness to overcome all difficulties for the country, and they deeply know this truth: overcoming difficulties is victory.

People from All Walks of Life Should Care More About the Growth of Young Students

Of course, there are still some shortcomings in schools and other work, many of which are caused by lack of experience, and individual ones are due to bureaucracy in leadership. These all belong to contradictions among the people. In this regard, students should actively make suggestions and criticisms to the leaders with the attitude of a master and with correct methods. Taking the method of strike and booing can only affect their own study and affect the normal order of society. I earnestly hope that school leaders, relevant departments, and people from all walks of life will pay more attention to the growth of young students, and regularly introduce to the students the glorious revolutionary traditions of the Chinese people, the great achievements of national construction, the bright prospects, and various difficulties through various means; actively assist in solving the reasonable opinions raised by the students; and give timely and patient explanations and education to incorrect and unrealistic opinions. I firmly believe that Chinese students with a glorious revolutionary tradition will be able to work together with school leaders and relevant departments to contribute their strength to running schools well.

Today, the Party and the people of the whole country place ardent hopes on us young people, hoping that we will inherit the cause of our revolutionary predecessors, overcome various difficulties, and support the banner of socialism to the final victory. The students of our country will certainly live up to this expectation, actively study Marxism-Leninism, diligently learn the various skills of building socialism, and contribute all our wisdom and strength to the great socialist cause of our motherland.

    正确认识和对待发展中的困难
    关若鸾向广大学生进一言
    我是作学生工作的，现在我想就广大学生应怎样认识和对待祖国建设过程中的困难，发表一点意见。
    我们回忆一下在国民党统治时代学生的遭遇吧
  在提及这个问题的时候，我不禁回想起全国解放前国民党统治区学生生活和斗争的情景。十年前国民党反动派正在集中全力进行反人民的内战，更加紧了对爱国人士和青年学生的迫害，很多热爱祖国的同学遭受逮捕和屠杀。国民党反动政府把财政支出的80％用作军事经费，教育经费不足1％，学生的学习条件当然很差，生活也极为悲惨。就拿学生的伙食和健康状况来说，学生们吃的是发霉发臭的“平价米”，所谓公费生每天也只有相当于两根半油条的菜金。由于营养严重不良，学校卫生设备又极差，那时的大学生中患肺病的竟达十分之一以上，有的学校甚至达到四分之一。当时同学中流行着这样一句话：“一年级买蜡烛，二年级买眼镜，三年级买痰盂，四年级买棺材。”大学毕业生饱尝了“毕业即失业”的痛苦，我记得当时南京新街口等地经常可以看到摆着地摊卖旧衣、旧书的失业的大学毕业生；有些同学侥幸地找到职业，也只能以雇员的身份为少数统治阶级服务。广大同学认识到要建设自由幸福的新中国，必须把自己的斗争紧密地和全国人民的革命斗争联结在一起，和全国人民共呼吸、共命运。1947年的5月20日南京、上海、北京等地的同学在共产党的领导下，继承和发扬了“五四”、“一二·九”、“一二·一”的光荣革命传统，喊出了“反饥饿、反内战、反迫害”的呼声，向国民党反动派进行了英勇顽强的斗争。
    今天，学生的境遇有了根本的变化，祖国的伟大的社会主义建设，更为我国学生展示了无限美好的前程。我们同学感到最大的幸福就是：学好了本领，不再为少数人作奴才，而是为人民服务，用自己辛勤的劳动，建设繁荣幸福的祖国。
    我们和资本主义国家学生的生活对比一下吧
    为了培养建设人才，人民政府在旧中国遗留下来的破烂的经济基础上，以最大的努力发展了教育事业。拿高等学校来说，目前学生人数已达四十万三千，比解放前学生人数最多的一年（1946年）增加了将近三倍；七年来，大学毕业生相当于解放前三十六年（1912—1947年）的毕业生人数的一点三倍；七年来，高等学校修建了七百多万平方公尺的校舍，这个建筑面积比从1898年清朝光绪戊戍变法到1949年解放时还多一百余万平方公尺；全体学生享受了公费医疗的待遇，绝大部分学生享受着助学金；政府还贯彻了为工农开门的教育方针，高等学校的工农成份的学生已占全体学生的三分之一。今天，我国学生不论是在政治地位上和精神生活上也是资本主义国家的学生们不能比拟的。去年法国巴黎大学学生阿娜特和阿麦特·拉拉基曾经告诉我：在巴黎大学只有十分之一的学生能住在校内，住宿生每月要缴三千法郎左右的房租；大学生享受奖学金的人数很少，工农子弟不到2％；大部分学生要半工半读，有的作教师，有的在旅店中作招待员，有的作保姆；很多学生因经济困难而中途辍学，如阿娜特所在的地理系三年级，在一年级时有二百五十二人；而三年级时只剩下四十五人了。根据“日本教育年鉴”的统计材料，日本大学生中必须靠半工半读的约占36％，要求半工半读的则在70％左右。半工半读学生的工作时间一般在一个月内占十一—八十小时，有的甚至高达一百六十小时；大学毕业生的就业也是很困难。记得在三年前，日本有关人士曾经给我国全国学联来信，说：当时有数万大学毕业生找不到职业，不少人要求来我国工作。
    我们应当认清发展中的困难，正确对待困难
    当然，我国建设才七年，我们国家还有很多困难，我们的学校也还有许多困难，如学校发展很快，校舍的建筑跟不上，校舍当然就要挤一些；学生增多了，师资也不够，目前青年教师占60％以上，其中不少人的教学质量也还不能满足要求；此外，教学设备、教材等等也还有许多困难。就是毕业后走上工作岗位，也会碰到各种不同的困难。我们会不会没有困难或躲开困难呢？那是决不可能的事情，我们今天的胜利就是在克服了许多困难之后获得的，我们今天和明天还会不断遇到更多的困难，我们克服了这些困难，才会取得更大的胜利。困难是总会有的，问题是如何正确地对待困难。
    现在同学中对困难有两种不同的态度。一种态度是要求国家把自己的一切安排得妥妥当当，否则就消极埋怨，显然这不是一种国家主人翁的态度，而是把自己看作革命大家庭中的“大少爷”。这样的人是很难设想将来能担负起建设社会主义、共产主义的重担的。同时，这样想也是不现实的。应该看到，我们国家1955年比1949年的财政经费只增加五倍，然而1955年的教育经费已比解放前增加了二十八倍，1956年的国家文教经费又较1955年增加了26．3％，国家培养一个高等学校的学生要花八千元（助学金等还不包括在内）。如果今天我们还要求国家再增加教育经费，把什么事情都给包下来，一切都用最高的标准来要求，都弄得舒舒服服，这势必要影响国家的经济建设，这样也是对全国人民和学生的最高的、长远的利益不利的。
    另一种态度就是：抱着主人翁的态度，克勤克俭地协助国家克服困难。毛主席教导我们：“胜利是在和困难的斗争中取得的，新中国的青年要有战胜困难的一切准备”。我们的前辈在过去的革命斗争中，曾经战胜无数的困难才取得了今天的光辉胜利。我们要继承他们的事业，首先必须学习他们对革命事业的忠心耿耿、不怕困难的精神。我们不仅要以正确的态度认清国家的困难，还要以主人翁的态度去战胜困难。有些学校的同学正是这样作的，他们把自己动手解决能够解决的问题看成是自己义不容辞的责任。如西北俄文专科学校这学期开学时有些校舍没有修好，同学们就利用课余时间开展义务劳动，帮助建校；清华大学学生在金属工学实习中，从去年8月以来，改变了过去完全消耗的状况，为国家生产了一批产品。到目前为止，已制成三百台苏式水泵约值六万三千三百元。这些水泵有的已送鞍山钢铁公司、包头钢铁公司等处使用。西安航空学院的同学积极响应增产节约的号召，提出“不浪费一度电、一滴水、一粒米，不随便向国家要求补助”等口号，半个月内就节约了三千斤粮食。这些事例是举不胜举的。同学们的这种行动，不仅协助学校克服了一些困难，而且在实践中也培养了自己“一切为人民着想”“劳动光荣”的观点和艰苦朴素的作风。我们的许多大学毕业生也都自觉地要求去困难最多、环境最苦的地方工作，如今年北京农业机械化学院毕业生主动积极地报名去艰苦的北大荒垦荒；地质勘探学院的毕业生经常冒着风雨和烈日，不分白天黑夜在渺无人烟的地方进行勘探，他们充满着愉快和自豪的感情，唱着这样的歌：“是那山谷的风，吹动了我们的红旗，是那狂暴的雨，洗刷了我们的帐篷，我们有火焰般的热情，战胜了疲劳和寒冷，背上我们的行装，攀上层层的山峰，我们满怀着无限的希望，为国家寻找丰富的矿藏”。同志们，这就是我国青年学生对待艰苦和困难的英雄气概。他们所以能够如此，原因就在于他们把为国家去战胜一切困难当作是自己最大的快乐，他们深知这一真理：战胜困难就是胜利。
    各界人士要多多关怀青年学生的成长
    当然，在学校和其它工作中也还存在一些缺点，其中不少是由于经验不足造成的，个别则是由于领导上存在着官僚主义。这些都属于人民内部的矛盾，对此，同学们应该以主人翁的态度和用正确的方法，积极地向领导提出建议和批评。采取罢课、哄闹的办法，只能是影响自己的学习，影响社会的正常秩序。我热切希望学校领导、有关部门和各界人士更多地关心青年学生的成长，经常地通过各种方式向同学介绍我国人民的光荣革命传统、祖国建设的伟大成就、光辉远景和各种困难；对于同学提出的合理意见，积极协助加以解决；对于不正确的、不切实际的意见，及时地、耐心地给予解释和教育。我坚信，有着光荣革命传统的中国学生一定能够和学校领导、有关部门同心协力，为办好学校贡献出自己的力量的。
    今天，党和全国人民对我们青年寄予殷切的希望，希望我们继承革命前辈的事业，战胜各种困难，把社会主义的旗帜支撑到最后胜利。我们全国同学一定不会辜负这个期望，积极学习马列主义，勤奋地学好建设社会主义的各种本领，把我们全部智慧和力量贡献给我们祖国伟大的社会主义事业。
