    Commenting on "The Chinese Revolutionary Movement During the May Fourth Period"
    Xu Zongmian, Wang Shihao

    In recent years, the number of social science works published has gradually increased. Among them, there are some treatises based on serious research, which play a role, more or less, in promoting academic research. This is a very good phenomenon, indicating that the enthusiasm of our academic workers for research and writing is increasing. However, it should be pointed out that among the social science books currently published, some are often not the result of serious research by the authors. In this type of work, there are few first-hand materials, nor are there in-depth analyses of existing materials or new arguments, but rather a collection of common materials and conclusions already made by others. Although this type of work does not have any major errors, it will not have a positive effect on promoting academic research. It does not and cannot profoundly and clearly explain the laws and processes of the research object. Moreover, the style it exhibits—not conducting serious and independent research, but simply satisfying itself with repeating ready-made principles and materials—may even have a negative impact.

    Here, we cite Mr. Hong Huanchun's "The Chinese Revolutionary Movement During the May Fourth Period" (Sanlian Bookstore, published in August 1956) for some analysis. We cite this book not because it has nothing to commend, but because it reflects the above-mentioned shortcomings of lacking independent and serious research.

    Systematically studying the history of the May Fourth period is of great significance for clarifying the development process of modern China. "The Chinese Revolutionary Movement During the May Fourth Period" is a recently published monograph on the revolutionary history of the "May Fourth" period. It deserves attention. In the "Preface," the author stated that he wanted to conduct a "comprehensive analysis of the revolutionary history and social development process at that time" based on the historical facts of the "May Fourth" period, in order to explain the laws of revolutionary historical development during the "May Fourth" period. The author's intention is good. The book cites historical materials from various sources and provides a relatively detailed account of the background, process, and historical significance of the May Fourth Movement, which is also very good. However, this book can be said to have made no new research achievements. Although it has borrowed some correct conclusions from the works of other historians and cited many specific materials, there is a lack of organic connection between the two. Many quotations and conclusions, whether in parentheses or not, are correct, but they have not been transformed into the author's own flesh and blood, but are simply pieced together in a rigid manner. Therefore, basically speaking, it has neither advanced the research on the history of the May Fourth period nor clearly explained the laws of historical development at that time at the existing scientific level. This fundamental shortcoming is reflected in the book's discussion of a series of important historical issues. Here, we only raise a few of the more obvious points.

    Regarding the rise of the New Culture Movement before the October Revolution, the author, in addition to citing the words of Lu Xun and Comrade Mao Zedong, simply said that under the dark rule of the feudal warlords after the Xinhai Revolution, "some progressive intellectuals dared to question the status quo, and this doubt led to a fierce attack on feudalism. At that time, the democratic spirit of the masses was also much higher than in the late Qing Dynasty. In this way, the New Culture Movement against feudal culture and ideology was formed." This explanation was copied from others. The author did not further develop it according to the needs of this book.

    We know that the emergence of the Chinese New Culture Movement before the October Revolution had its ideological origins and was closely related to the historical conditions at that time. It inherited and further developed the anti-feudal democratic ideas put forward and promoted by the reformers at the end of the 19th century and the revolutionary democrats at the beginning of the 20th century. The reason why the New Culture Movement before the October Revolution could become an unprecedentedly widespread and profound anti-feudal democratic ideological enlightenment movement was inseparable from the changes in the domestic political situation after the Xinhai Revolution. For example, it was precisely the criticism of the weaknesses of the Xinhai Revolution and the nascent doubts about the implementation of the bourgeois political system that led radical democratic intellectuals to launch a struggle against feudalism in the ideological field. At the same time, the Xinhai Revolution buried the feudal imperial system and the democratic spirit surged for a time, creating conditions for the emergence of the New Culture Movement at that time. It can be seen that the emergence of the New Culture Movement in 1915 had many historical factors. In a book specifically discussing the May Fourth Movement, only a full and thorough explanation of the many reasons for the emergence of the New Culture Movement at that time can more clearly explain the historical background of the May Fourth Movement, so as to distinguish it from a brief essay. However, this book neither mentions the ideological origins of the New Culture Movement nor makes an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of its historical conditions, especially neglecting the positive influence of the Xinhai Revolution on it.

    Regarding the impact of the October Revolution on the May Fourth Movement, this book describes the Chinese people's welcome of the October Revolution and the ideological changes of some ideological representatives, especially Li Dazhao, which is necessary. But merely saying these things, people still cannot clearly see the full impact of the October Revolution on the May Fourth Movement. In fact, the impact of the October Revolution on the May Fourth Movement was very broad. For example, before the May Fourth Movement, in addition to a very few advanced intellectuals who recognized and were determined to take the socialist road, there were also some petty-bourgeois intellectuals who saw the "new tide" of the socialist revolution and gained from it new hope for national independence and their own liberation. Therefore, the October Revolution pointed out the fundamental direction of the revolution for the Chinese people and inspired their fighting spirit. Due to the enlightenment of the October Revolution, on the eve of the May Fourth Movement, not only did the advanced elements who initially accepted communist ideas begin to understand the truth that revolutionary intellectuals must combine with the workers and peasants, but also many petty-bourgeois intellectuals were stirred by the communist ideology, believing that the liberation of China must be achieved by the broad masses themselves taking direct action. Even some bourgeois intellectuals began to change their long-standing attitude of despising the laboring people to some extent, regarding the lives of laborers as noble and rational lives of mankind (Cai Yuanpei's slogan of "Labor is Sacred" is an example; this book mentions Cai's speech, but does not point out its representative significance). This recognition of the power of the masses by the broad masses of intellectuals, although still very superficial, powerfully promoted the Chinese people to move towards direct mass struggles. At the same time, the October Revolution and the revolutionary movements in various countries, including not only Europe but also Asia, that broke out under its influence, constantly attracted and infected the Chinese people with mass revolutionary struggle methods such as parades, demonstrations, strikes, and uprisings. For example, the "March 1st" uprising of the Korean people in 1919 had a profound impact on China at that time. Due to the widespread influence of the October Revolution and world revolution mentioned above, people at that time felt even more intolerable about the national crisis deepened by the intensified aggression of Japanese imperialism and the dark rule of the warlord traitorous government, and urgently demanded to unite and break the ugly status quo with the actions of the masses themselves. It was under this situation that the May Fourth Movement broke out.

    We believe that only a full explanation of the above can make us understand the rich and profound meaning of Comrade Mao Zedong's statement that "the May Fourth Movement occurred under the call of the world revolution at that time, under the call of the Russian revolution, and under the call of Lenin" ("On New Democracy"), and also understand why the May Fourth Movement has some characteristics that the old democratic revolution did not have.

    Therefore, to explain the full impact of the October Revolution on the May Fourth Movement, one cannot be limited to describing the thoughts and activities of some ideological representatives in China after the October Revolution one by one, but must at least combine their discussion to comprehensively analyze the general ideological changes of the intellectuals of various classes at that time, and explain the relationship between these changes and the May Fourth Movement. However, in addition to making a generally correct explanation of the ideological changes of a few representative figures such as Li Dazhao, this book simply uses simple and general words such as "ideologically, they have all undergone certain changes," "have obtained the correct direction in ideological transformation," and "inspired and enlightened the new patriotic consciousness of the Chinese people" to lightly gloss over the general progressive intellectuals. In narrating the National Student Federation's reply in 1920 to the Soviet Russian declaration on China published at that time, the author pointed out the new understanding reached by young students at this time, but this was already after the May Fourth Movement. Although this book also cited the above-mentioned words of Comrade Mao Zedong and pointed out that "the October Revolution and the revolutionary movements in various European countries that followed... provided practical examples of revolutionary action," it did not make a full and specific explanation of these existing correct conclusions, so they not only did not solve the problem, but on the contrary made people feel rigid and empty.

    Regarding the reasons why Marxism-Leninism could spread after the May Fourth Movement, this book only briefly pointed out at the end of the narration of the May Fourth Movement process that, because the working class showed its revolutionary power in the May Fourth Movement, it promoted advanced intellectuals to resolutely go to the worker masses to spread Marxism-Leninism after the May Fourth Movement. This explanation is also not complete and sufficient. The widespread dissemination of Marxism-Leninism was also related to the changes in domestic social thought at that time, in addition to the reasons mentioned by the author. Due to the May Fourth Movement and the influence of Soviet Russia, many people recognized the face of imperialism and became interested in socialism. Therefore, after the May Fourth Movement, there appeared a trend of talking about socialism among petty-bourgeois and bourgeois intellectuals. Although petty-bourgeois and bourgeois intellectuals held different and erroneous understandings of socialism, this enthusiasm for socialism showed that those who truly wanted China to be independent and prosperous no longer sought the path to solve China's problems from capitalism but only from socialism. This situation made it easy for people to approach, understand, and accept Marxism-Leninism. It is necessary to point this out, not only because it is a historical fact, but also because it helps to explain the epoch-making significance of the May Fourth Movement and can help us understand why, in modern China, Marxism-Leninism can defeat the various reactionary ideas supported by the reactionary ruling class and penetrate deeper into the hearts of the people than any other ideology. However, the author neither made any new explorations on the above issues, nor made his own arguments at the existing scientific level, but simply repeated the words of others.

    This book narrates the propaganda of Marxism-Leninism by communist intellectuals, the engagement in the workers' movement, and the struggle between Marxism-Leninism and reactionary ideas in three separate sections, but it does not pay full attention to the connections between them, especially the connection between the workers' movement and the struggle against reactionary ideas, and does not make any explanation. We know that the establishment of communist groups in various places in 1920 marked the beginning of the combination of Marxism-Leninism and the Chinese workers' movement. This combination was carried out and developed in the struggle against various reactionary ideas. Through the series of struggles of communists against the reactionary ideas of Zhang Dongsun and Liang Qichao, anarchism, and the Second International revisionism, the influence of Marxism-Leninism was expanded, directly preparing for the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party in 1921. On this issue, the author is similarly satisfied with some ready-made arguments and does not make deeper research. For example, regarding the significance of the struggle of communists against anarchism and revisionism—the former of which was particularly an obstacle encountered by communists in the socialist movement at that time (such as in the workers' movement and socialist groups)—most of the existing historical works rarely discuss it, and this book does not make any explanation at all, only mentioning his work to win over anarchists when narrating Comrade Mao Zedong's revolutionary activities. Due to these shortcomings, this book fails to fully reflect the development process of the entire socialist movement after the May Fourth Movement, fails to make a full historical argument for the birth of the Chinese Communist Party, and only gives people some fragmented historical knowledge.

    From the above, it can be seen that the author has not been able to profoundly and clearly explain the development process of the revolutionary history of the "May Fourth" period. This shortcoming is also reflected in the narrative method of this book. In the book, not only are there many chapters lacking organic connections between them, but also the materials narrated in the same section are mostly taken by listing. This inevitably produces many shortcomings of fragmentation, repetition, and disorganization. For example, some parts of the fourth section of the first chapter, "The World Significance of the October Socialist Revolution and the New Awakening of the Chinese People," are repeated with the second section of the second chapter, "The Transformation of the Chinese New Culture Movement Under the Influence of the October Revolution," or although not completely repeated, they cannot be narrated separately. For example, the workers' strike struggles in the May Fourth Movement narrated in this book are separated from the activities of students and other masses at that time. In fact, the students' struggles and the influence of their political propaganda played an important role in awakening the workers to participate in the May Fourth Movement. For example, before "June 3rd" at that time, Beijing students had specially gone to the workers of the Beijing-Hankou and Beijing-Fengtian Railways to conduct oral and written propaganda. However, this book does not make any explanation of this connection.

    The evaluation of certain historical figures and the use of materials in this book are also unscientific and not rigorous. We will only briefly give one or two examples.

    When analyzing Li Dazhao's "Victory of the Common People" and "Victory of Bolshevism," the author said: "After the October Revolution, the nature of the Chinese revolution's transformation from the old democratic revolution to a part of the new democratic revolution of the world proletariat has been basically explained in Li Dazhao's above two papers." We believe that it is possible to say that Li Dazhao began to connect the Chinese revolution with the world socialist revolution at that time (although this idea was still very crude at the time), but to say that he had already made a "basic explanation" of the transformation of the Chinese old democratic revolution into a new democratic revolution before the May Fourth Movement and had "the budding of the idea of people's democratic revolution" is contrary to the facts. We find it difficult to consider this excessive praise a correct evaluation of Li Dazhao's thought and his immortal historical achievements.

    Similarly, it is also inappropriate for the author to cite Lu Xun's words in 1934, "The existence and success of the Soviet Union now make me firmly believe that a classless society must appear, not only completely eliminating doubts, but also increasing a lot of courage" ("Reply to the International Literary Society"), as material for intellectuals in the May Fourth period to accept socialist ideas.

    In addition, the author's plagiarism is unavoidable to make people feel glaring. We believe that plagiarism has nothing in common with absorbing the research results of others and must be opposed.

    From the above, it can be seen that the author did not conduct independent and serious research on the history of the May Fourth period on the basis of mastering a large amount of material, but simply added some ready-made conclusions to the existing material. Therefore, this book has neither been able to make more and deeper explanations of the revolutionary history of the May Fourth period than the existing level, nor has it been able to make a complete summary of the existing research results in this area. We believe that if an academic work, although it does not put forward anything new, can well and comprehensively summarize the existing research results and clearly reflect the level reached by current science, then it is also meaningful for promoting the development of scientific research. However, it should be seen that such a work must also be produced on the basis of serious research. Because the correct understanding, acceptance, and synthesis of other people's scientific achievements can only be realized through real research; otherwise, it can only be reciting and copying the words of others.

    There is no shortcut to scientific research. We hope that comrades who are engaged in research work will increase their enthusiasm for writing and abandon the style of not conducting independent and serious research, and work in a down-to-earth and in-depth manner. Because only in this way can we make creative contributions to the development and prosperity of our country's academic field.

    评“五四时期的中国革命运动”
    徐宗勉　王士豪
    近年来出版的社会科学著作逐渐增多。其中出现了一些经过认真研究的论著，它们对于推动学术研究有着或多或少的作用。这是很好的现象，它表明我国学术工作者的研究和写作的积极性正在增高。但是应当指出，在目前出版的社会科学书籍中，往往有一些并不是作者进行认真研究的成果。在这类著作中，很少有第一手的材料，也没有对现有的材料进行深入的分析，提出新的论证，而只是汇集了一些常见的材料和别人已经作出的结论。这类著作尽管没有什么重大错误，它对推动学术研究是不会有什么积极的作用的，它没有也不可能深刻地清晰地阐明研究对象的规律和过程，而它所表现的那种不作认真、独立的研究，只满足于复述现成的原则和材料的作风，甚至还可能产生不好的影响。
    这里，我们举出洪焕椿先生的“五四时期的中国革命运动”（三联书店，1956年8月出版）一书来作一些分析。举出这本书，并不是因为它毫无可取之处，而是因为它反映了上述缺乏独立、认真研究的缺点。
    系统地研究五四运动时期的历史，对于阐明近代中国的发展过程有着很大的意义。“五四时期的中国革命运动”是新近出版的一本论述“五四”时期革命历史的专著。它是值得重视的。作者在“前言”中表示，要根据“五四”时期的历史事实“把当时的革命历史和社会发展过程作综合性的分析”，以说明“五四”时期革命历史发展的规律。作者的这个企图是好的。此书引用了各方面的历史材料，对五四运动的背景、过程和历史意义作了比较详细的叙述，这也是很好的。然而，此书可说没有作出任何新的研究成果，虽然从其他几位历史家的著作中搬来了一些正确的结论，也引用了不少具体材料，但二者之间缺乏有机的联系，很多加括号或不加括号的引语和结论是正确的，但却没有化为自己的血肉，而只是生硬地被拼凑在一起，因此基本上说来，既没有把五四时期历史的研究推进一步，也没有能在现有的科学水平上清晰地阐明当时历史发展的规律。这个根本性的缺点表现在此书对一系列重要历史问题的论述上。这里，我们只提出比较明显的几点。
    关于十月革命前的新文化运动的兴起，作者除了引证鲁迅和毛泽东同志的话以外，就只是说，在辛亥革命以后封建军阀的黑暗统治下面，“一部分进步知识分子敢于对现状起了怀疑，这种怀疑引起了对于封建主义的猛烈攻击。当时群众的民主精神也远较清朝末年为高。这样，就形成了反对封建文化思想的新文化运动”。这个说明是从人家那里抄来的。作者没有根据这本书的需要，作进一步的发挥。
    我们知道，十月革命以前的中国新文化运动的产生有其思想渊源而又是同当时的历史条件密切相关的。它继承了十九世纪末维新志士和二十世纪初革命民主主义者所提出和宣扬的反对封建文化的民主思想并加以进一步的发扬。而十月革命前的新文化运动之所以能够成为空前广泛和深刻的反封建的民主主义思想启蒙运动，则是同辛亥革命和辛亥革命以后国内政治状况的变化分不开的。例如，正是对辛亥革命的弱点的批判和开始产生的对实行资产阶级政治制度的怀疑，引导激进的民主主义知识分子从思想领域里发动反封建的斗争。同时也由于辛亥革命埋葬了封建帝制，民主精神高涨一时，为当时的新文化运动的产生创造了条件。可见，1915年新文化运动的出现是有着许多历史因素的。在一本专门论述五四运动的书里面只有对当时的新文化运动产生的许多原因作充分的周密的说明，才能更清楚地阐明五四运动的历史背景，以区别于一篇简短的论文。然而此书既没有提到新文化运动的思想渊源，也没有对它的历史条件作深入的全面的分析，特别是忽视了辛亥革命对它的积极影响。
    对于十月革命对五四运动的影响，此书叙述了中国人民欢迎十月革命的情况和当时一些思想代表人物特别是李大钊思想上的变化，这是必要的。可是仅仅说这些，人们仍然不能清楚地看到十月革命对五四运动的全部影响。事实上，十月革命对五四运动的影响是很广泛的。例如，在五四运动以前，除了极少数的先进的知识分子认清并决心走社会主义道路以外，还有一些小资产阶级知识分子也看到了社会主义革命的“新潮”，并从中获得了关于民族独立和自身解放的新希望。因而十月革命就给中国人民指出了革命的根本方向，鼓舞了他们的斗志。由于十月革命的启示，在五四运动前夕，不仅初步接受共产主义思想的先进分子开始懂得革命的知识分子必须同工农群众相结合的真理，而且很多小资产阶级知识分子也为共产主义思潮所激荡，认为中国的解放必须由广大人民自己起来采取直接的行动。甚至一些资产阶级知识分子也开始在某种程度上改变一向轻视劳动人民的态度，把劳动者的生活看成是人类高尚、合理的生活（蔡元培喊出
  “劳工神圣”的口号就是一例，此书提到蔡的这篇演说，但未指出它的代表意义）。广大知识分子对群众力量的这种认识虽然还很肤浅，但却有力地推动了中国人民走向直接的群众性的斗争。同时，十月革命和在它影响下爆发的不仅欧洲而且包括亚洲的各国革命运动，以游行示威、罢工、起义等群众性的革命斗争方式不断吸引和感染着中国人民。例如1919年朝鲜人民的“三一”起义，当时就对中国发生了亲切的影响。由于上述这些十月革命和世界革命的广泛的影响，使得当时人们对因日本帝国主义的加紧侵略而加深了的民族危机和军阀卖国政府的黑暗统治更加感到不能忍受，迫切要求联合起来，以群众自身的行动来打破丑恶的现状。就在这种形势下面，爆发了五四运动。
    我们认为，只有对上述这些作充分的说明，才能懂得毛泽东同志所说的“五四运动是在当时世界革命号召之下，是在俄国革命号召之下，是在列宁号召之下发生的”（“新民主主义论”）这句话的丰富而深刻的含意，也才能理解为什么五四运动具有旧民主主义革命所没有的一些特色。
    因此，要说明十月革命对五四运动的全部影响，就不能限于逐一地叙述十月革命后中国一些思想代表人物的思想和活动，而至少要结合对他们的论述来综合地分析当时各阶层知识分子的一般的思想变化，并说明这些变化同五四运动的关系。可是此书除了对李大钊等少数代表人物的思想变化，作了大体上是正确的说明以外，对于一般的进步知识分子就只是用“思想上都是起了一定的转变”、“在思想转变上获得了正确的方向”、“鼓舞了和启发了中国人民新的爱国意识”这类简单、笼统的话轻轻带过去。在叙述1920年全国学联答复当时发表的苏俄对华宣言的信时，作者曾指出此时青年学生所达到的新的认识，可是这已是五四运动以后的事了。此书虽然也引用了上述毛泽东同志的话和指出了“十月革命和继之而起的欧洲各国的革命运动……提供了革命行动的实际榜样”，但对这些已有的正确论断没有作充分的具体的说明，因而它们不但没有解决问题，相反地使人感到生硬和空洞。
    关于五四运动以后马克思列宁主义能够传播开来的原因，此书只是在叙述五四运动过程的最后简略地指出，由于工人阶级在五四运动中显示了自己的革命力量，因而推动了先进知识分子在五四运动以后坚决到工人群众中去传播马克思列宁主义。这个说明也并不就是完全的和充分的。马克思列宁主义得到广泛传播，除了作者提到的原因外，还同当时国内社会思想的变化有关。由于五四运动和苏俄的影响，使得许多人认清了帝国主义的面目，而对社会主义发生了兴趣。因此在五四运动以后，就出现了包括小资产阶级、资产阶级知识分子在内的高谈社会主义的风气。尽管小资产阶级、资产阶级知识分子对社会主义抱着不同的错误的理解，但这种对社会主义的热衷却表明了，当时真正想使中国独立、富强的人都不再向资本主义而只能向社会主义去寻求解决中国问题的道路。这种情况就使得马克思列宁主义易于为人们所接近、了解和接受。指出这一点是必要的，这不仅因为它是历史事实，而且因为它有助于说明五四运动的划时代的意义，并可以帮助我们懂得，为什么在现代中国，马克思列宁主义能够战胜反动统治阶级所支持的各式各样的反动思想，而比任何一种思想都深入人心。可是对于上述问题，作者也是既没有作任何新的探讨，又没有在现有的科学水平上作出自己的论证，而只是重复别人的词句。
    此书分别在三节中叙述了五四运动以后共产主义知识分子宣传马克思列宁主义、从事工人运动和马克思列宁主义同反动思想斗争的情况，但却没有充分注意到它们之间的联系，特别是对工人运动和反对反动思想的斗争之间的联系，未作任何说明。我们知道，1920年各地共产主义小组的建立，标志着马克思列宁主义开始同中国工人运动的结合。这种结合是在同各种反动思想的斗争中进行和发展的。通过共产主义者反对张东荪、梁启超的反动思想、无政府主义和第二国际改良主义的一系列的斗争，扩大了马克思列宁主义的影响，为1921年中国共产党的建立作了直接的准备。在这个问题上，作者同样是满足于现成的一些论证，而不作更深的研究。例如，关于共产主义者反对无政府主义和修正主义——它们特别是前者是当时共产主义者在社会主义运动中（例如在工人运动和社会主义团体中）遇到的障碍——的斗争的意义，已有的历史著作大多很少论到，而此书也就根本不作说明，只是在叙述毛泽东同志的革命活动时提了一下他争取无政府主义者的工作。由于这些缺点，此书就未能全面地反映出五四以后整个社会主义运动的发展过程，未能对中国共产党的诞生作充分的历史的论证，而只是给人一些片断的历史知识。
    从以上所述可以看到，作者没有能深刻地清晰地说明“五四”时期革命历史的发展过程。这个缺点也反映在此书的叙述方法上。在书中，不仅很多章节之间缺乏有机的联系，而且在同一节中所叙述的材料也多半是采取罗列的办法。这就不可避免地产生了许多割裂、重复和零乱的缺点。例如，第一章第四节“十月社会主义革命的世界意义和中国人民的新觉醒”中的某些部分，就是同第二章第二节“在十月革命影响下中国新文化运动的转变”重复，或者虽不完全重复但却是不能分开来叙述的。又如，此书所叙述的五四运动中的工人罢工斗争是同当时学生和其他群众的活动相脱离的。事实上，学生的斗争和他们的政治宣传的影响对于唤起工人群众参加五四运动起了重要的作用。如当时北京学生在“六三”以前就曾专门到京汉、京奉铁路工人中去进行口头和文字的宣传。但此书对这种联系未作任何说明。
    此书对某些历史人物的评价和材料的运用也是不科学和不严谨的。我们只简单地举一两个例子。
    作者在分析李大钊的“庶民的胜利”和“布尔什维主义的胜利”两文时说道：“十月革命以后，中国革命从旧民主主义转变为无产阶级世界革命一部分的新民主主义革命的性质，在李大钊以上两篇论文中，已经有了基本的说明”。我们认为，说李大钊当时开始把中国革命同世界社会主义革命联系起来是可以的（虽然这个思想当时还很粗糙），但说他在五四运动以前已对中国旧民主主义革命转变为新民主主义革命作了“基本的说明”，已经有了“人民民主革命思想的萌芽”，则是违反事实的。这种过分的褒扬，我们很难认为是对李大钊的思想和他的不朽的历史功绩的正确的评价。
    同样，作者把鲁迅在1934年所说的“现在苏联的存在和成功，使我确切的相信无阶级社会一定要出现，不但完全扫除了怀疑，而且增加许多勇气了”（“答国际文学社问”）这句话，当作五四时期知识分子接受社会主义思想的材料而加以引用，也是不适当的。
    此外，作者的抄袭行为不免使人感觉刺目。我们认为，抄袭同吸取别人的研究成果毫无共同之处，必须反对。
    从以上所述可以看到，作者没有在掌握大量的材料的基础上对五四时期的历史进行独立、认真的研究，而只是在现成的材料上面简单地加上一些现成的结论。因而，此书既没有能对五四时期革命历史作出比现有水平更多和更深刻的阐明，也未能对这方面已有的研究成果作出完满的总结。我们认为，如果一本学术著作，虽然没有提出什么新的东西，但能很好地全面地总结现有的研究成果，清楚地反映出当前科学所达到的水平，那末它对于推动科学研究的发展也是有意义的。然而应该看到，这样一种著作也必须在认真研究的基础上才能产生。因为正确地领会、接受和综合别人的科学成果，只有通过真正的研究才能实现，否则，就只能是背诵和抄录别人的词句。
    科学研究是没有近路可抄的。我们希望做研究工作的同志们提高写作的热情，而抛弃那种不作独立、认真的研究的作风，踏实地深入地做工作。因为只有这样，才能为我国学术的发展和繁荣作出创造性的贡献。
