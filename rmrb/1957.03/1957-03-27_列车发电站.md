　　Train Power Station

　　A train power station is a power station installed on a train. This type of power station can be quickly dispatched along railway lines to places in urgent need of electricity, solving power supply problems.

　　China has a vast territory and many emerging industrial enterprises. Some of these are far from existing power grids; some enterprises, although closer to power grids, often find that the power supply cannot meet their needs. If we were to adopt the method of building new power stations to support industrial construction in all cases, it would inevitably delay the construction schedule of industrial projects. A train power station dispatched to a place where electricity is needed can begin supplying power in a very short time. Therefore, it is regarded as a mobile force in the electrical power sector.

　　The entire equipment of a train power station is very sophisticated and complete. It has all kinds of the latest automatic devices and safety protection devices that a modern power plant should have.

　　Train power is still an emerging undertaking in our country. Baoding City is building China's first train power industry base. Here, a power generation train is being installed to go to Luoyang to support the Sanmenxia construction project. In the future, there are plans to purchase and assemble more train power stations with greater power generation capacity to support the continuously developing large-scale industrial construction.

　　列车发电站
    列车发电站，就是安装在火车上的发电站。这种发电站能沿着铁路线迅速调度到急需用电的地方，解决供电问题。
    我国幅员辽阔，新兴工业企业很多。其中有些离现有电力网较远；有些企业虽然离电力网较近，电力供应也常不能满足它的需要。如果都采用建设新电站的方法支援工业建设，势必延缓工业建设的施工日期。列车发电站调度到用电的地方，在很短的时间里就能开始供电。因此，它被视为电力上的一支机动部队。
    列车发电站整个电站的设备都很精巧、完善，凡是近代化的发电厂应有的各种最新的自动装置和安全保护装置，它都应有尽有。
    列车发电在我国还是一种新兴事业。在保定市正在建设我国第一个列车电业基地。现在这里正在安装着开往洛阳支援三门峡建设工程的发电列车。将来这里还准备购置和装配更多、发电容量更大的列车发电站，以支援不断发展的大规模工业建设。
