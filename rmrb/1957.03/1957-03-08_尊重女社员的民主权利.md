    Respect the Democratic Rights of Female Cooperative Members
    Jian Zi
    Currently, the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives already have a certain number of female cadres. According to statistics from ninety counties in Henan Province alone, there are 58,864 female team leaders and cooperative affairs committee members. Most of these female cadres are very active and enthusiastic; however, they encounter many difficulties in their work. One of the difficulties is that the rights of some female cadres are not respected as they should be, and they are troubled by being "officials in name only." In many meetings, what male cadres say counts, while what female cadres say doesn't matter. Although some female cadres have long suggested that special circumstances of women should be taken care of in production, it has not attracted the attention of male cadres. Many male team leaders, when encountering problems in production, sometimes only discuss them with the group leaders and then make decisions, without consulting with the female team leaders in their team beforehand, and often without telling the female team leaders afterwards. Therefore, some female team leaders cannot understand the specific situation of the team more fully and cannot play their due role. Many agricultural cooperatives do not respect the democratic rights of female cooperative members sufficiently. The number of attendees at members' meetings is calculated on a household basis, and even if half of the members are female and do not attend, it can still be considered that "all members" or "the majority of members" attended, and the resolutions passed are considered "legal."
    In recent years, although the idea of ​​underestimating women has changed greatly due to the increasingly obvious role women have played in production, it cannot be said that this idea has been completely overcome. If this idea is not seriously overcome, it will hinder the growth of female backbone members and will be detrimental to giving full play to the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of women.
    Female cooperative members are members of the collective, and generally speaking, they are very concerned about the affairs of the collective; some people seem indifferent to the affairs of the cooperative on the surface, but that is precisely the result of being underestimated for a long time. Only by respecting their democratic rights can we encourage them to broaden their horizons and raise their awareness. The working ability of some female cooperative members is not strong, precisely because they have been underestimated for a long time and have too few opportunities to participate in work. Only by letting them participate in collective activities can we give full play to their enthusiasm and turn them into people with working ability and production experience. Generally speaking, although female members have less knowledge of agricultural production, they are very experienced in certain sideline productions, and women should be given the opportunity to fully utilize their specialties. To enable them to fully utilize their specialties, we must first respect their due democratic rights.

    尊重女社员的民主权利
    剑子
    现在，绝大部分农业合作社都已经有了一定数量的女干部。仅据河南省九十个县统计，就有五万八千八百六十四个女队长和女社务委员。这些妇女干部大多数都很积极热情；但是，她们在工作中却遇到了不少困难。困难之一就是一些女干部的权利没受到应有的尊重，她们为“有职无权”而苦恼。在许多会议上，男干部说的话算数，女干部说的话不顶事。有些女干部虽然早已提过在生产中应该照顾妇女的特殊情况，但是没有引起男干部的重视。许多男队长，在生产中遇到什么问题，有时只和组长们一研究就确定了，事先既不和本队的女队长商量，事后往往也不告诉女队长。因此，有些女队长不能更多地了解队里的具体情况，不能发挥应有的作用。许多农业社对于女社员的民主权利更不够尊重，开社员大会是以户为单位计算出席人数，即使占社员人数一半的女社员都不到会，也可以算作“全体社员”或者“多数社员”出席了，通过的决议也被人认为是“合法”的。
    近几年来，虽然由于妇女在生产上越来越明显地发挥了巨大的作用，轻视妇女的思想已有了很大改变；但是，还不能说这种思想已经完全被克服了。如果不认真克服这种思想，将会妨碍妇女骨干分子的生长，不利于发挥广大妇女群众的生产积极性。
    女社员是集体中的一员，一般地说是很关心集体的事情的；有些人从表面上看来似乎对社里的事有些淡漠，其实那正是长期受人轻视的结果。只有尊重她们的民主权利，才能促使她们放大眼光，提高觉悟。有些女社员的工作能力不强，也正是长期受人轻视、参加工作的机会太少的结果。只有放手让她们参加集体活动，才能发挥她们的积极性，使她们变成有工作能力和生产经验的人。一般地说，妇女社员虽然农业生产的知识较差，但是对于某些副业生产是很有经验的，应当使妇女有机会充分发挥她们的特长。要使她们的特长能够充分地发挥出来，首先应当尊重她们应有的民主权利。
