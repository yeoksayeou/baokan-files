Xinhua News Agency, March 19th - The National Agricultural Production Cooperative Business Management Conference convened by the Ministry of Agriculture on March 7th concluded today.

After full discussion and research, all the representatives attending the meeting further clarified that running cooperatives diligently and thriftily and running cooperatives democratically are the basic principles of agricultural cooperative business management. They also believe that properly arranging production and doing a good job in labor planning and financial management are important links in running cooperatives diligently and thriftily and developing production. The meeting required all localities to comprehensively deploy agricultural production in accordance with this spirit, based on the principle of prioritizing the development of grain production while also developing other diversified operations. When formulating labor plans, attention should be paid to the overall arrangement of agriculture and sideline occupations, collective production and household sideline occupations, as well as the planning of agricultural production and basic construction. At the same time, in the organization and use of labor, attention should be paid not only to the balance of seasons but also to the balance of the whole year, so as to carry out production and construction step by step and in a planned manner.

Regarding the basic construction of agricultural cooperatives, the meeting believed that the manpower, materials, and financial resources of the agricultural cooperatives themselves should be used as much as possible. It also required that benefits should be obtained as quickly as possible in order to cultivate the ability to reinvest.

Regarding the implementation of democratic cooperative management, the meeting also exchanged experiences in this regard and conducted discussions based on the report of Vice Premier Deng Zihui. Everyone believed that all business management work must be carried out on a democratic basis. At the same time, it is impossible to run cooperatives diligently and thriftily without promoting democracy within the cooperative.

The meeting also required all localities to constantly strengthen the political and ideological work of agricultural cooperative members, so as to gradually eliminate the contradictions between members and the collective, the advanced and the backward (conservative), and continuously improve their awareness, so as to better develop socialist agriculture.

　　农业合作社怎样做好经营管理工作？
　　勤俭办社和民主办社是基本方针
    新华社19日讯　农业部3月7日召开的全国农业生产合作社经营管理会议已在今日结束。
    出席会议的全体代表在经过了充分的讨论和研究后，进一步明确了勤俭办社和民主办社是农业社经营管理的基本方针；并且认为恰当地安排好生产和作好劳动规划及财务管理工作又是勤俭办社、发展生产的重要环节。会议要求各地依照这一精神根据优先发展粮食生产同时发展其他多种经营的方针来全面部署农业生产。在制订劳动规划时，既要注意农业与副业、集体生产与家庭副业的统筹安排，也要注意农业生产与基本建设计划性，同时在劳动力的组织和使用上，不但要注意做到季节的平衡，还要注意做到全年的平衡，以便有步骤有计划的来进行生产建设。
    对农业社的基本建设问题，会议认为要尽量利用农业社本身的人力、物力和财力来进行。并且要求尽速的能得到效益，以便培养再投资的能力。
    关于贯彻民主办社的问题，会议也交换了这方面的经验，并且根据邓子恢副总理的报告进行了讨论，大家认为全部经营管理工作都必须在民主的基础上进行。同时勤俭办社离开了发扬社内民主也是不可能的。
    会议还要求各地要经常的加强对农业社社员的政治思想工作，以便逐步消除社员与集体、先进与落后（保守）的矛盾，不断地提高他们的觉悟，更好地来发展社会主义农业。
