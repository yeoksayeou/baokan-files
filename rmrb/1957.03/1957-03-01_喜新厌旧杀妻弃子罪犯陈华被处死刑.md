Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 28th. On February 24th, the Luzhou District Intermediate People's Court of Sichuan Province, with the approval of the Sichuan Provincial Higher People's Court, sentenced Chen Hua, guilty of killing his wife and abandoning his children out of lust for the new and disgust for the old, to death, and immediately carried out the execution by shooting.

Chen Hua was from Ziyang County, with a landlord background. In the early days of liberation, he served as a squad leader under the bandit chief Zhang Zhao's troops, wreaking havoc in the countryside. In 1951, he infiltrated the South Sichuan Trade Cadre School and was later transferred to work at the Xuyong County Grain Bureau. He and his wife, Zhao Shunqing, fell in love and married in 1947. They had a good relationship after marriage and had three children. However, Chen Hua's exploitative class habits did not change. After a few years, he disliked that Zhao Shunqing, who was the same age as him, was "too old" and felt that their married life "had no joy." He sent Zhao Shunqing and their children back to their old home in Ziyang County from where he worked, and at the same time cut off their support, demanding a divorce. Zhao Shunqing was unwilling to divorce, and relatives and friends condemned Chen Hua's shameful behavior of abandoning his wife and children, but Chen Hua did not repent in the slightest.

In 1954, when Chen Hua was working at the Xuyong County Grain Bureau, he had an improper love affair with an eighteen-year-old girl surnamed Huang from the local area, and his pressure on his wife became even more intense. He wrote to Zhao Shunqing repeatedly, proposing some deceptive conditions to get her to agree to a divorce. Zhao Shunqing replied, refusing politely and asking him to restore their old relationship. At the same time, leaders and comrades in the organization also criticized Chen Hua. Under these circumstances, in order to achieve his shameful goal, Chen Hua decided to personally murder his wife.

On February 11, 1955, Chen Hua took the opportunity of a business trip to return to his old home in Ziyang County, pretending to take Zhao Shunqing to Xuyong County. Zhao Shunqing thought that her husband had changed his mind, so she went with him happily. Who knew that late at night on the third day, after getting off the train in Longchang County, Chen Hua led Zhao Shunqing to a shed in the desolate Caijia Cemetery Mountain and strangled his wife with a rope. After the brutal Chen Hua killed his wife, he left the one-year-old child who was crying next to the corpse and ran away. He took a bus in Longchang County, attempting to escape back to Xuyong County to get married. However, unexpectedly, when the bus arrived at Xiaoshi in Luzhou, Chen Hua was arrested by public security personnel waiting at the station.

    喜新厌旧杀妻弃子罪犯陈华被处死刑
    新华社成都28日电  2月24日，四川省泸州地区中级人民法院经四川省高级人民法院核准，判处喜新厌旧、杀妻弃子的罪犯陈华以死刑，并立即执行枪决。
    陈华是资阳县人，地主出身，解放初期曾在土匪头子张召南部下任分队长，横行乡里。1951年混入川南贸易干部学校，后调到叙永县粮食局工作。他和妻子赵顺清是在1947年恋爱结婚的。婚后夫妻感情很好，生了三个孩子。但是，陈华的剥削阶级习性未改，没有几年，便嫌和他同年的赵顺清“年纪大了”，认为夫妻生活“没有乐趣”，把赵顺清母子从他工作的地方送回资阳县老家，同时断绝了供养，要求离婚。赵顺清不愿意离婚，亲友们也谴责了陈华遗弃妻子儿女的可耻行为，但是陈华丝毫没有改悔。
    1954年陈华在叙永县粮食局工作时，同当地一个姓黄的十八岁姑娘发生了不正当的恋爱关系，对妻子的逼迫也更紧了。他三番五次给赵顺清写信，提出一些欺骗性的条件要她答应离婚。赵顺清回信婉言拒绝，要求他恢复旧好。同时机关领导上和同志们也对陈华进行了批评。在这种情况下，为了达到可耻的目的，陈华决定亲手杀害自己的妻子。
    1955年2月11日，陈华乘出差机会回到资阳县老家，假意接赵顺清到叙永县。赵顺清以为丈夫已经回心转意，便高高兴兴跟他去了。那知第三天深夜在隆昌县下了火车，陈华便把赵顺清领到荒凉的蔡家坟山一个凉棚里，用绳子勒死了妻子。凶残的陈华杀死了妻子后，把年仅一岁正在啼哭的孩子丢在尸体旁边便跑了。他在隆昌县搭上汽车，企图逃回叙永县去结婚。可是，出乎他的意料，车到泸州小市，陈华便被守候在车站上的公安人员逮捕了。
