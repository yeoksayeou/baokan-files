　　"Four-Free" Granary Without Chemicals

    (Our report) The Hengfan Grain Management Office in Lin'an County, Zhejiang Province, has eleven old-style granaries capable of storing 1,060,000 jin of grain. For nine months, these granaries did not use a single jin of chemicals and met the requirements of a "Four-Free" granary. The storage cost per 10,000 jin of grain was only 1.6 yuan, which is 89.4% lower than the provincial standard of 15 yuan per 10,000 jin, saving a total of 1,420 yuan in storage costs.

    The Hengfan Grain Management Office can keep the grain well without chemicals mainly because they ensure the cleanliness and hygiene of the granaries. After the grain is put into storage, they do a comprehensive job of covering the grain surface and adopt a sealed storage method to prevent the emergence and breeding of wheat moths, as well as the infection of external pests. In addition, strict inspection and sorting of the grain before it is put into storage, to ensure that the stored grain is free of insects and the grain quality meets the standards, is also a very important factor.

　　不用药剂的“四无”粮仓
    本报讯　浙江省临安县的横畈粮食管理所，有十一间旧式粮仓，容粮一百零六万斤。在九个月中，这些粮仓没用一斤药剂，达到了“四无”粮仓的要求。每万斤粮食的保管费用只要一元六角，比省定标准每万斤十五元低89.4％，共节约了保管费用一千四百二十元。
    横畈粮管所不用药剂能够保管好粮食，主要是因为他们保证了粮仓的清洁卫生，粮食入库以后全面做好了粮面压盖，采取密闭保管的方法，防止麦蛾的羽化和繁殖，以及外界虫害的感染。此外，粮食入库前进行了严格检验和整理，保证入库粮食无虫，粮质合乎标准，也是一个极重要的因素。　吕寿春
