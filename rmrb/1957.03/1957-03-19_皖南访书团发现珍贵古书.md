    Anhui Southern Book Finding Team Discovers Precious Ancient Books

    The Anhui Southern Book Finding Team, jointly organized by the Ministry of Culture and the Anhui Provincial Bureau of Culture, has concluded its twenty-day book-finding work. The team not only gained a preliminary understanding of the distribution of ancient books in the Anhui Southern region and further publicized the government's policy of rescuing ancient books, but also purchased many precious ancient books.

    Among these precious ancient books are Dong Jieyuan's "Romance of the West Chamber" in eight volumes, collated and printed by Shishi Zi of Haiyang, with a preface by Zhang Yuxiongfei of Huanghu Mountain in the autumn of the Ding Si year of the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty, which is the earliest version of Dong’s “Romance of the West Chamber” in our country. This book is of high value for studying the literature of the Jin and Yuan dynasties in our country. There is Chen Zhanghou's "博古叶子" [Bogu Leaflets – possibly referring to illustrated playing cards or a similar game]. There are Xiao Yuncong's "Taiping Landscape Map" and Gu Zhengyi's "Illustrated Manual," both of which are relatively rare in China and have high artistic value, occupying an important position in the history of printmaking. There is the "Gelin Shicui," a large-scale anthology of legends from the early Qing Dynasty, which preserves zero excerpts of legends that have been lost. Other Ming dynasty-era engraved genealogies, manuscripts, fish-scale registers, and poetry manuscripts are also of some reference value.

    Xinhua bookstores in various places have done a lot of work in purchasing ancient books. For example, the book "Gelin Shicui" was first bought from the masses by a small vendor. After hearing about this, Comrade Bao Tingsong of Shexian Xinhua Bookstore ran ten miles and negotiated several times before buying it. Dong's "Romance of the West Chamber" was received by the book-finding team in Qingxi in cooperation with the Xinhua Bookstore. Since its establishment in October last year, the Tunxi Ancient Books Bookstore has taken in nearly 30,000 ancient books in just a few months (not including those transported to Tunxi for sale by Xinhua Bookstores in nearby counties), and there are also quite a few rare editions.

    皖南访书团发现珍贵古书
    由文化部和安徽省文化局共同组织的皖南访书团，已结束了历时二十天的访书工作。访书团不仅初步掌握了皖南地区的古籍分布情况，进一步宣传了政府抢救古籍的政策，而且收购了不少珍贵的古书。
    这些珍贵的古书中，有董解元“西厢记”八卷，海阳适适子校梓，前有明嘉靖丁巳秋八月黄鹄山人张羽雄飞序，是我国最早的一部董西厢。这部书对研究我国金、元文学有很高的价值。有陈章候的“博古叶子”。有萧云从的“太平山水图”和顾正谊的“图谱”，这二部书在国内都是比较罕见的，具有高度的艺术价值，在版画史上占有重要地位。有清初大型本传奇选集“歌林拾翠”，其中保存了已经失传了的传奇零出。其他还有明刻家谱、抄本、鱼鳞册和诗文稿本多种，也具有一定的参考价值。
    各地新华书店在收购古书方面都做了不少工作。如“歌林拾翠”一书，先是一位小商贩在群众中买来，歙县新华书店鲍廷松同志闻讯后，跑到十里路外经过几次协商才买下的。董西厢是访书团在清溪配合新华书店收到的。屯溪古籍书店，自去年10月成立以来，短短数月，即已收进近三万册古书（附近各县新华书店运到屯溪出售的还不在内）珍本亦不在少数。（陈载阳）
