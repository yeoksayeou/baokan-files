Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Thai officials announced today that, based on the vote counts from fifty-two of the seventy-one provinces nationwide, the Seri Manangkasila Party secured fifty-two of the eighty-nine seats, the Democrat Party secured twelve seats, and the Economist Party secured one seat. The remaining twenty-four seats were divided among four other parties. It is already certain that the seats already obtained by the Seri Manangkasila Party, combined with the seats of all the appointed second-category members of parliament that the party possesses, are sufficient to continue to secure an overwhelming majority in parliament. The "Daily Mail" published an editorial on the election situation, saying, "The people clearly know where the thousands of forged ballots discovered in several places came from and who printed them. This stain will never be erased from the name of the ruling Seri Manangkasila Party."
