    Sketches of Damascus
    By Our Correspondent Jiang Yuanchun

    Although Damascus is less than two and a half hours by plane from Cairo, it presents a distinctly wintery scene. The fields are a expanse of withered yellow. Except for some evergreen pines, cypresses, hollies, olive trees, and eucalyptus, other trees have lost their leaves. There are many poplars here, and their slender, upright, white trunks stand out strikingly against the earthy yellow background of the winter landscape. In the city, people wear woolen coats, and houses are heated with stoves or central heating. However, in our view, the climate is not too cold. Winter is the season with the most rainfall in Syria, while summer is dry and hot. During our stay in Damascus, it rained for several consecutive days, and even a light snow fell one night. It is said that it rarely snows in Damascus once in several years, so we were fortunate to witness it. However, the high mountains northwest and southwest of Damascus are already covered with snow.

    Damascus is one of the oldest cities in the world. Around 1500 BC, a branch of the Semitic people from the Arabian Peninsula, known as the Arameans, began to establish a kingdom here. According to this calculation, it has a history of three thousand five hundred years. The city faces southeast, backing northwest against the sparsely wooded Mount Qasioun. The city begins halfway up the mountain and extends towards the plain in the southeast. The houses on the mountainside are relatively low and old. Most of the residents are immigrants from other places. Some are descendants of the Kurds who followed Saladin, the famous general who resisted the Crusaders, and some are Circassians and Albanians transplanted here by the Turks in the 19th century.

    From the foot of the mountain southward, there is a newly built area. This is a high-end residential area, embassy district, and new commercial district. This area was originally a field between the immigrant area on the mountainside and the old city at the foot of the mountain. The current buildings were all newly built within the ten years after Syria's independence. The roads here are wide and very quiet, lined with exquisite small buildings, each striving for uniqueness in style and layout. The powder-yellow walls are adorned with green shutters, creating a beautiful contrast.

    Southeast of this new district lies the old city, home to many historical sites and bustling commercial areas. The most famous historical site is the Umayyad Mosque. This mosque was built during the Umayyad dynasty, the first Arab dynasty in the sixth century. The original site was a Christian church. Christianity had already been introduced before the rise of Islam and its dominance in the Arab world. Inside the main prayer hall of the mosque, the tomb of Saint John and a well used by Christians for baptism are still preserved. One of its three minarets is called the Minaret of Christ. The simultaneous preservation of Christian altars and relics in an Islamic mosque seems quite common here. We also saw this in Aleppo. This spirit of religious tolerance is commendable compared to the persecution of heresy in medieval Europe. Unfortunately, this grand mosque has suffered from a major fire, and many beautiful and precious murals have been lost. Only a portion near the altar in the main prayer hall remains. The corridor walls of the courtyard still retain intact mosaics made of small colored tiles in the sixth century, depicting the scenery of Damascus at that time. The green mountains, clear waters, pavilions, and towers in the pictures allow one to imagine the magnificent grandeur of this place in the past.

    Near the Umayyad Mosque are also the tomb of Saladin, the hero who resisted the Crusaders, the Azem Palace, which reflects the aristocratic life of centuries ago, some quaint buildings, and an ancient straight street, city walls, and city gates related to stories in the Bible, all of which cannot be described in detail here.

    Surrounding the Umayyad Mosque is a large market. This is a place somewhat similar to the Dong'an Market and Xidan Shopping Center in Beijing, but larger in scope and wider in streets. The streets on both sides are lined with shops, and the streets are covered with awnings like those on train station platforms, which can shield from wind, rain, and sun. The shop fronts are similar to those in Beijing's shopping malls. The main streets also have many branching small streets and alleys, almost exactly like those inside the Dong'an Market.

    The main streets have all kinds of shops, especially department stores, silk and cloth shops, candy and preserved fruit shops, and carpet shops. Some streets specialize in one type of commodity. One small street is entirely filled with shoe shops, displaying everything from slippers and children's shoes made of camel leather to women's shoes inlaid with colored mother-of-pearl. One street is full of carpentry shops. Turning from here into an extremely narrow and old alley, you will discover that it is the headquarters of goldsmith shops specializing in making various gold ornaments. Some small streets, in order to prevent vehicles from entering, have erected wooden or iron posts at the street entrance, which is exactly like the style of Dazhalan Menkuang Hutong in Beijing.

    Some shops here specialize in selling various handicrafts for which Damascus is most famous. These shops also specially placed several looms in the backyards, so that you can see how craftsmen use the extremely primitive method of two people facing each other to weave the world-renowned Damascus brocade with gold and silver threads. Here you can also see the famous inlaid mosaic work, where tiny colored porcelain pieces are inlaid on a small wooden box to create various geometric patterns. There are also copperware inlaid with silver and embroidered tablecloths. The embroidery method of this tablecloth is similar to a type of "braiding" embroidery in the Jiangnan area of China. Extremely complex and beautiful patterns are embroidered on a white or beige rayon base cloth with silk threads of water green, golden yellow, light blue, and light purple. We picked and looked at dozens of tablecloths, and no two had the same pattern, which was truly amazing.

    In the market, you can see all kinds of people. Men from nomadic tribes in the eastern desert (called Bedouins here) wear white or red checkered headscarves covering the back of their heads and cheeks, looking very majestic and rugged. This kind of headscarf is very useful in protecting the face in the desert. Bedouin women often wear very beautiful national costumes as they walk down the street. There seem to be more women wearing veils than in Cairo, but they are only wrapped in a piece of transparent black gauze, somewhat like the way women in Beijing wear veils in the spring when there is a lot of wind and sand. There are also many women who do not wear veils. From the faces of some women, probably from the desert or the countryside, it can be seen that they still have the habit of tattooing their faces, especially on the lower part of their cheeks and chin, which greatly impairs their appearance.

    South of the old city market area, a part of the city extends into the fields like a dagger, called the Midan District. This is a residential area for the poorer citizens and one of the most revolutionary districts in Damascus. During the French rule, this was often the place where uprisings against French colonialists were launched.

    Standing halfway up Mount Qasioun, you can see a panoramic view of Damascus. Here, you will find that the city is surrounded by dense forests. This is the famous Damascus "Ghouta." "Ghouta" means a green place. This is a very famous oasis with lush vegetation in the Middle East. From here to the south, through the rugged Trus Mountains, you can reach Jordan. To the west, after more than forty kilometers of mountain road, you reach Lebanon. To the north, across the foothills of the Anti-Lebanon Mountains, is the fertile valley of the Orontes River. To the east, all the way to the banks of the Euphrates River, are undulating barren plateaus, hills, and deserts.

    Except for the western coastal area along the Mediterranean Sea and the northeastern Jazirah region, which have more rainfall, the rest of Syria has very little rainfall throughout the year. According to statistics in 1953, cultivated and arable land in the country only accounted for 40% of the total land area. Among the 20% of the total area that is cultivated, only 15% can be irrigated, and 85% rely on natural rainfall. Therefore, river irrigation plays an extremely important role in Syrian agriculture. The Damascus "Ghouta" relies on the irrigation of two rivers. One is the Barada River, which flows through the city of Damascus and is seventy-one kilometers long. The other is the Awaj River, which is sixty-six kilometers long. Both rivers flow eastward into lakes in the desert. Along the rivers, many orchards have sprung up. Peaches, plums, apricots, apples, and olives are the main agricultural products of this region. In recent years, capitalist agricultural operations have greatly developed around Damascus and in the northeastern Jazirah region. However, around Damascus, the focus is on orchards, while in the northeastern region, the focus is on cotton planting. Many people have purchased five to ten hectares of land here, dug wells for irrigation, and hired workers to plant fruit trees, believing it to be a profitable business. Many landlords are now also beginning to adopt capitalist management methods. Therefore, land prices here have soared. Land that used to cost more than one thousand Syrian pounds per hectare may not be available for four to five thousand Syrian pounds now.

    In addition to handicrafts, Damascus also has some modern industries. The more important ones include a cement factory, three textile factories, and a glass factory. These factories are all national capital. Because the factories are relatively new, the machinery and equipment are relatively good. Unfortunately, the market problem cannot be well resolved, so they are currently operating below capacity. Incidentally, in Syria, it is said that except for an asphalt mine operated by foreign capital in Latakia on the Mediterranean coast, all factories are now operated by national capital. This is a matter that deserves attention.

    When we left Damascus, the weather was getting warmer. The apricot and peach blossoms, which herald the arrival of spring, began to bud and bloom. Syrian friends very regretfully said to us that if we could stay for another half month, we could see the beautiful spring of Damascus. However, even if we cannot see it with our own eyes, we can imagine the scene of green grass on Mount Qasioun, blossoming flowers on the trees below, and throngs of tourists. We can agree with what our Syrian friends said: Damascus is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. (Attached pictures)

    大马士革速写
    本报记者  蒋元椿
    大马士革离开罗虽然不到两个半小时的飞机航程，可是这里却是道地的冬天景象。田野里一片枯黄。除了一些常绿的松、柏、冬青、橄榄树和油加利树之外，旁的树都落了叶。这里有许多白杨树，它们的苗条挺拔的白色树杆，在冬天原野的土黄色的背景前特别醒目。在城市里，行人们穿着呢大衣，屋子里生着火炉或是烧着暖气。不过，在我们看来，气候还不算太冷。冬季是叙利亚下雨最多的季节，夏季就干燥而热。我们在大马士革期间，接连下了几天雨，还下了一夜小雪。据说，大马士革几年里面难得下一次雪，这次我们又算是碰上了。不过，在大马士革西北和西南的高山上，却早就是积雪皑皑的了。
    大马士革是世界上最古老的城市之一。公元前一千五百年左右，从阿拉伯半岛来的塞米特人的一支，称为阿拉美伊安人，在这里开始建立了一个王国。照这样算来，它已经有三千五百年的历史了。城市坐西北，朝东南。西北是一带树木稀少的山，称为卡西翁山。城市从半山腰里开始，向东南平地上伸展。山坡上的房子，比较低矮陈旧。居民大部分是外来的移民。有的是跟随抵抗十字军的名将萨拉丁而来的库尔特人的后裔，有的是十九世纪土耳其在这里移殖的塞加西亚人和阿尔巴尼亚人。
    从山坡以下往南，是一片新建的区域。这里是高级的住宅区，使馆区和新的商业区。这个地区本来是介于山坡上的移民区和山下的旧城之间的一片田野，现在的建筑都是在叙利亚独立以后的十年之内新建的。这里马路宽阔，非常幽静，两边是一幢一幢小巧玲珑的楼房，样式和格局都争奇斗胜，相当精致。粉黄色墙上嵌着一扇一扇绿色的百叶窗，衬托得非常美丽。
    从这个新建区再往东南，就到了旧城。这里有许多名胜古迹和热闹的商业区。最著名的古迹是奥马牙特清真寺。这个清真寺建于六世纪时第一个阿拉伯人的王朝——奥马牙特王朝。原址是一个基督教堂。因为在伊斯兰教兴起并且在阿拉伯世界取得统治地位以前，基督教早已传入。现在在寺内的大礼拜堂内，还保存着圣约翰的墓和当年基督教徒作洗礼时汲水用的一口井。它的三个尖塔之一，称为基督尖塔。在伊斯兰教清真寺中同时保存着基督教的祭坛和圣物，在这里似乎相当普遍。我们在阿勒颇也看到有这种情形。这种在宗教上互相容忍的精神，比起欧洲中世纪的诛灭异端来，应当说是难能可贵的。可惜这个大清真寺曾经遭到大火，许多美丽珍贵的壁画装饰已经损失，现在只在大礼拜堂的神灶附近还保留了一部分。院子走廊的壁上还保留有六世纪时制作的整幅用小块彩色瓷砖拚成的镶嵌细工，表现当时大马士革的景色。图上的青山绿水，亭台楼阁，使人还可以想像出当年这里金碧辉煌的气概。
    在奥马牙特清真寺附近，还有抵抗十字军的英雄萨拉丁之墓，足以想见几百年前贵族生活的阿泽姆宫，一些古色古香的建筑，以及同圣经里的故事有关的一条古老的直街、城墙和城门，这里都无法一一描绘了。
    环绕着奥马牙特清真寺，是一片很大的市场。这是一个有点类似北京的东安市场和西单商场的地方，不过范围还要大些，街道也要宽些。几条街两边都是店铺，街道上面搭着像火车站月台上的那种雨篷，可以遮蔽风雨和太阳。商店的门面，同北京的商场差不多。主要街道两旁，也有许多分枝的小街巷，那情形几乎同东安市场里面的一模一样。
    主要街道上有着各种各样的商店，特别多的是百货店，绸缎布匹店，糖果蜜饯铺，地毯铺。有几条街专门出售一种商品。有一条小街完全是鞋子铺。沿街摆满了从骆驼皮做的拖鞋、童鞋，一直到镶有彩色珠母片的女鞋，应有尽有。有一条街全是木匠铺，从这里转进一条极其狭窄陈旧的小巷，你就发现这里原来是专做各种金饰的金匠铺的总汇。有些小街为了不让车马进去，在街口上竖了几根木桩或铁桩，那就完全是北京大栅栏门框胡同的派头了。
    这里有些铺子专门出售大马士革最出名的各种手工艺品。这些铺子还在后院里特地放了几张织机，使你可以看到工匠们怎样用极原始的两人对面投梭的方法，用金银线织出举世闻名的大马士革织锦。在这里你也可以看到著名的镶嵌细工，在一个小小的木匣上用细小的彩色瓷片镶嵌出各种几何图刊。此外还有嵌银的铜器和刺绣的桌布。这种桌布的刺绣方法类似中国江南一带的一种“辫法”刺绣，在白色或米黄色的人造丝底布上，用水绿、金黄、淡蓝、浅紫等色丝线，绣出极其繁复美丽的图案。我们挑看了几十块桌布，没有一块花样相同，令人赞叹不已。
    在市场里你可以看到各种各样的人。从东部沙漠上来的游牧民族（这里称为贝陀因人）的男子，头上戴着白色的或是有红格子的遮住后脑和两颊的头巾，样子很威武粗犷。这种头巾在沙漠中对保护面部是很有用处的。贝陀因妇女常常穿着很美丽的民族服装，在街上走过。妇女戴面纱的比开罗似乎还多些，不过只是包上一块透明的黑纱而已，有点像北京妇女在春天风沙大的时候包面纱的那种样子。也有许多妇女不包面纱。从有些大概是从沙漠或农村来的妇女的脸上，可以看出她们还有在脸上刺花的习惯，特别在两颊下部和下巴上，这就大大损害了她们的容颜。
    从旧城市场区往南，像一把匕首一样伸出在田野里的一部分市区，称为米旦区。这里是比较贫苦的市民的居区，也是大马士革最革命的一个区。在法国统治时期，这里常常是反抗法国殖民主义者的起义发动的地方。
    站在卡西翁山的半腰里，可以看到大马士革的全景。在这里，你就发现在市区周围，是一片密密的树林。这就是有名的大马士革“古他”。“古他”的意思是绿色的地方。这是中东极有名的一个水草丰美的绿洲。由此往南，经过山峦重叠的特鲁士山区，可通约旦。往西经过四十多公里山路，就到了黎巴嫩。往北越过安梯黎巴嫩山脉的余脉，是奥龙底河的肥沃的河谷。往东一直到幼发拉底河边上，就都是起伏不毛的台地、丘陵和沙漠了。
    叙利亚除了西部靠地中海一带和东北部吉齐拉地区雨量较多以外，其余地区一年之中雨量很少。1953年的统计，全国已耕和可耕的只占土地总面积的40％。而在占总面积20％的已耕土地中，能够得到灌溉的只有15％，依靠天然雨水耕种的占85％。因此河流灌溉在叙利亚的农业中有极重要的作用。大马士革“古他”就是依靠了两条河流的灌溉。一条是流经大马士革市内的巴拉达河，全长七十一公里。另一条是阿瓦其河，全长六十六公里。两条河都向东注入沙漠中的湖泊。沿着河流经过的地方，兴起了许多果园。桃、李、杏、苹果、橄榄，是这个地区主要的农产品。近年以来，资本主义的农业经营在大马士革周围和东北部吉齐拉地区有了很大的发展，只是在大马士革经营的是果园，而在东北地区经营的是棉花种植。有不少人在这里购置五到十公顷的土地，开掘水井进行灌溉，雇工种植果树，认为是有利可图的事情。许多地主现在也开始改用资本主义的经营方式。因此这里的地价飞涨。从前一千多叙镑一公顷的土地，现在出四、五千叙镑也未必能够买到。
    大马士革除了手工业以外，还有一些近代化的工业。比较重要的有一个水泥厂，三个纺织厂，一个玻璃厂。这些工厂都是民族资本。由于建厂较新，机器设备都比较好。可惜市场问题不能很好解决，因此目前都陷于开工不足。顺便提一句，在叙利亚，据说除了在地中海边上的拉塔基亚有一个外国资本经营的沥青矿之外，现在所有的工厂都是民族资本经营的。这是一件值得重视的事情。
    我们离开大马士革的时候，天气已经越来越暖和。得春意最早的杏花和桃花，开始含苞吐蕊。叙利亚朋友们非常惋惜地对我们说，要是我们能再多留半个月，就可以见到大马士革的美丽的春天了。可是，即使我们不能亲眼看到，我们也可以想像出卡西翁山上绿草如茵，山下繁花满树、游人如织的景色。我们可以同意叙利亚朋友们所说的话：大马士革是世界上最美丽的城市之一。（附图片）
