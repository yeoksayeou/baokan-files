　　The United States' Crude Interference in Egypt
    Since the Egyptian government took over the civil administration of the Gaza Strip, the area has gradually returned to a normal, peaceful, and orderly life. Schools, which had been closed for more than four months, have reopened, and food supplies are guaranteed. All peace-loving people are concerned and pleased by this change in the situation in the Gaza Strip.
    However, some countries with ulterior motives have a completely different feeling about this new situation. First, the United States was greatly "shocked" and described Egypt's restoration of its legitimate sovereignty in the Gaza Strip as "not moving in the direction that the United States hoped it would go." Israel even clamored that a "serious crisis" had emerged in the Gaza Strip, openly demanding that the United States fulfill its "promise" to Israel. Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir rushed to Washington for talks with U.S. Secretary of State Dulles. In a joint statement issued on March 18, Israel reiterated the conditions for withdrawal it had put forward at the United Nations on March 1, and the United States pledged to adhere to the policy expressed by Lodge in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly on March 1 and by Eisenhower in his letter to Ben-Gurion on March 2. As everyone knows, Israel's conditions for withdrawal proposed at the United Nations General Assembly on March 1 were to demand guarantees of "free navigation" in the Gulf of Aqaba and the indefinite stationing of United Nations forces in the Gaza Strip. At that time, U.S. Representative Lodge immediately spoke in support of Israel's "plan." In a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion the next day, Eisenhower further stated that Israel's "hopes and expectations are reasonable, and the United States will try to ensure that these hopes are not disappointed." The joint statement issued by Dulles and Meir on March 18 was in fact a reaffirmation of these "guarantees" to Israel by the United States. Prior to this, in order to conceal the fact that it was standing on the side of the Israeli aggressors, the United States had repeatedly tried to deny that it had provided Israel with any guarantees for withdrawal. Now this lie has fallen apart.
    How exactly will the United States realize the "guarantees" it has provided to Israel? Current facts show that the United States is exerting pressure on Egypt from all sides in an attempt to force Egypt to accept the U.S. aggressive plan for the Middle East. The United States and Israel are threatening and intimidating Egypt, forcing it to accept the unreasonable demands of "free navigation" in the Gulf of Aqaba and the indefinite stationing of United Nations forces in the Gaza Strip. Eisenhower's special envoy Richards is lobbying in Middle Eastern and North African countries, trying to divide the unity of Arab countries and isolate Egypt. Egypt is about to announce the complete restoration of navigation in the Suez Canal, but the United States has secretly colluded with Britain and France in advance to try to deprive Egypt of half of the transit fees. A U.S. news agency said, "The United States is slowly but surely applying pressure to force Nasser's government not to take actions that Washington considers reckless in the delicate Middle East situation." At the same time, the propaganda organs of the United States have issued various cries, rudely attacking the Egyptian government and people. The "New York Times," which often reflects the intentions of the U.S. State Department, recently even described Egypt's legal action of taking over the civil administration of the Gaza Strip as a "brazen and provocative act." This newspaper also openly called on the United Nations and the United States to "mobilize all moral forces" to increase pressure on Egypt.
    It is not difficult to see from here that although the Israeli invading army has been forced to withdraw from Egyptian territory, the United States is still using Israel as a tool for it to implement its aggressive policy in the Middle East. The United States' crude interference in Egypt and Middle Eastern affairs is bringing new threats to peace and security in the Middle East. This cannot but arouse people's serious vigilance.

### 美国对埃及的粗暴干涉

　　美国对埃及的粗暴干涉
    埃及政府接管加沙地区民政机构以来，这个地区已经逐渐恢复了正常的和平生活秩序。停课四个多月的学校已经重新开学，粮食供应工作也有了保障。一切爱好和平的人们都以欣慰的心情关切着加沙地区情况的这种改变。
    但是，一些居心叵测的国家，却对这种新情况有着完全不同的感觉。首先是美国感到大为“震惊”，它把埃及在加沙地区恢复自己的合法主权，说成是“没有按照美国希望它走的方向前进”。以色列更大肆叫嚣加沙地区出现了什么“严重危机”，公开要求美国实现它对以色列的“诺言”。以色列外长梅厄夫人匆忙地赶到华盛顿，同美国国务卿杜勒斯举行了会谈。在3月18日发表的联合声明中，以色列重申了3月1日它在联合国提出的撤军条件，美国则保证要坚持洛奇3月1日在联合国大会的发言中和艾森豪威尔在3月2日给本—古里安的信中所表示的政策。大家知道，以色列3月1日在联合国大会提出的撤军条件，就是要求保证亚喀巴湾的“自由通航”和联合国部队无限期驻扎在加沙地区。当时，美国代表洛奇立即发言支持以色列的这个“计划”。而艾森豪威尔在第二天致以色列总理本—古里安的信中，更认为以色列的“希望和期待是合理的，美国将要设法使这些希望不致于落空”。杜勒斯和梅厄夫人3月18日发表的联合声明，事实上是美国向以色列重申这些“保证”。在此以前，美国为了掩饰自己是站在以色列侵略者一边，曾一再竭力否认它对以色列提供过什么撤军保证。现在这种谎言是不攻自破了。
    美国究竟如何来实现它向以色列所提供的“保证”呢？目前种种事实表明，美国正在从各方面对埃及施加压力，企图迫使埃及接受美国对中近东地区的侵略计划。美国和以色列向埃及进行威胁和恫吓，强迫它接受亚喀巴湾“自由通航”和联合国部队无限期驻扎加沙地区的无理要求。艾森豪威尔特使理查兹正在中东和北非国家进行游说，力图分裂阿拉伯国家的团结，使埃及孤立起来。埃及即将宣布苏伊士运河完全恢复通航，可是美国事先就同英法暗中勾结，想要剥夺埃及的一半通行费。美国通讯社说，“美国正在缓慢地但是稳妥地施加压力，以迫使纳赛尔的政府不要采取华盛顿认为在微妙的中东局势中是轻率的行动”。同时，美国的宣传机关发出了各种叫嚷，粗暴地攻击埃及政府和人民。经常反映美国国务院意图的“纽约时报”，最近甚至把埃及接收加沙地区民政机关的合法行动，说成是“目中无人的和挑衅的行动”。这家报纸还公开要求联合国和美国“动员一切道义力量”加强对埃及的压力。
    从这里不难看到，以色列侵略军虽然已经被迫从埃及领土上撤退了，但美国还是在利用以色列作为它在中近东地区推行侵略政策的工具。美国对埃及和中近东事务的粗暴干涉，给中近东地区的和平和安全带来新的威胁。这不能不引起人们的严重警惕。
