Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 2nd: The Soviet Congress of Outstanding Youth and Komsomol Members in Virgin Land Reclamation concluded on March 1st at the Kremlin, passing a letter to Komsomol members and young men and women working on virgin land reclamation.

The letter to the youth stated that just three years ago, land reclaimers set up their first tents in the boundless wilderness of Siberia, Kazakhstan, the Urals, and the Volga River region. Today, hundreds of state farms have been added here, and 35.5 million hectares of virgin and fallow land have been cultivated. The country's granaries have accumulated 1.5 billion poods of grain produced in the newly cultivated areas.

The participants in the Congress, representing all the workers in the newly reclaimed areas, guaranteed to plant and harvest more grain this year than last autumn, and also to reclaim four to five million hectares of wasteland.

They called on the youth: "Report glad tidings to the motherland with an unprecedented bumper harvest!" "Turn our grasslands into prosperous areas where people can live and work in peace and contentment!"

    变荒原为乐园  用丰收来报喜
    苏联垦荒青年代表大会发出号召
    据新华社莫斯科2日电  苏联开垦荒地优秀青年和共青团员代表大会3月1日在克里姆林宫闭幕，通过了告开垦荒地的男女共青团员和男女青年书。
    告青年书说，仅仅是三年以前，垦荒者才在西伯利亚、哈萨克、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域无边无际的原野上安下了第一批帐篷。今天这里已经增加了几百个国营农场，开垦了三千五百五十万公顷的生熟荒地。国家的粮仓中积蓄了十五亿普特新开垦地区生产的粮食。
    参加代表大会的人代表全体新垦区的劳动者保证今年种植和收获比去年秋天更多的粮食，还要开垦四、五百万公顷的荒地。
    他们号召青年们：“用空前的大丰收向祖国报喜！”“把我们的草原变为安居乐业的繁荣地区！”
