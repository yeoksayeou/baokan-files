    The Lu Xun Library in Prague
    In Prague, on the quiet Lašská Street, a sign reading "Oriental Institute of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences" hangs in front of a four-story building. In 1952, a new Chinese library was established within this institute, with the inscription "Lu Xun Library" by Guo Moruo on the library wall.
    The Lu Xun Library in Prague is currently the largest Chinese library in Central Europe.
    The library's naming after Lu Xun has its origins. Lu Xun was the first modern Chinese writer to meet Czechoslovak readers through his works. "A Call to Arms," published in Czech in Prague in 1937, was the first work of modern Chinese literature translated into Czech. Three months before his death, Lu Xun wrote a preface for the Czech version of "A Call to Arms," in which he wished that the people of China and Czechoslovakia would understand and approach each other on the common path of seeking light. His wish has been realized.
    Today's Lu Xun Library began to be laid at that time. Academician Jaroslav Průšek, a famous Czech Sinologist, studied in China before World War II and brought back many Chinese classics to the Oriental Institute. However, in capitalist Czechoslovakia, a true Chinese library could not be established. It was not until the establishment of the worker-peasant government that the wishes of Czech Sinologists could be realized. In 1951, Academician Průšek led a group of cultural workers to visit China again, and the Chinese government presented them with a batch of Chinese books as gifts from the Chinese people. In order to meet the growing interest of the Czech people in China, with the efforts of Czech Sinologists and the full support of the Czech government, this Chinese library was finally born in Prague.
    Dr. Berta Krebsová, who has studied Lu Xun's works for many years, is the leader of the Lu Xun Library. She has translated many of Lu Xun's works into Czech and has also written papers on Lu Xun's works. Last year, she came to China to participate in the conference commemorating the 20th anniversary of Lu Xun's death.
    The Lu Xun Library now has about 50,000 volumes of books. It collects all kinds of Chinese books. The collection increases by about 5,000 volumes each year. The Lu Xun Library is expanding in this way.
    The increasing enrichment and development of the Lu Xun Library is also a concrete manifestation of Sino-Czech cultural ties. The Chinese government and academic institutions are constantly sending new books to Prague through exchange or donation. For example, the Lu Xun Library received a complete bound volume of the "New Youth" magazine donated by our country last year.
    Now, the Lu Xun Library is not only effectively serving Sinologists in Czechoslovakia, but also researchers from other countries (mainly Sinologists from people's democratic countries) often visit this library. The library helps Sinologists study various aspects of ancient and modern Chinese culture.
    It is not only Sinologists who are interested in understanding China. Every day, many university students, artists, journalists, musicians, etc., come to the Lu Xun Library to collect the materials they need. Chinese students are also regular readers of this library, and they can use the Chinese translations of foreign works collected there to study European literature.
    The Lu Xun Library is a popular place, and it has built a bridge for Czechoslovak friends to understand Chinese life.

    布拉格的鲁迅图书馆
    在布拉格，在幽静的拉申斯卡街，一座四层楼房的门前挂着“捷克斯洛伐克科学院东方研究所”的牌子。1952年，这个研究所里面新成立了一个中文图书馆，图书馆的墙上有郭沫若的题字：“鲁迅图书馆”。
    布拉格的鲁迅图书馆是目前中欧最大的中文图书馆。
    图书馆以鲁迅命名是有它的来历的。鲁迅是第一个通过自己的作品同捷克斯洛伐克读者见面的现代中国作家。1937年在布拉格以捷文出版的“呐喊”，是第一部译为捷文的中国现代文学作品。鲁迅在逝世前三月还为“呐喊”的捷文版写了序言，他在序言中祝中捷两国人民在寻求光明的共同道路上互相了解和接近。他的愿望已经实现了。
    今天的鲁迅图书馆从那时起就开始奠基了。著名的捷克斯洛伐克汉学家雅罗斯拉夫·普实克院士，在第二次世界大战以前曾游学中国，回国时为东方研究所带去了许多中国典籍。但是，在资本主义时期的捷克斯洛伐克，真正的中文图书馆是无法建立起来的。直到工农政府成立后，捷克斯洛伐克汉学家们的愿望才有可能实现。1951年，普实克院士率领一批文化工作者再度访问我国，我国政府赠送他们一批中国书籍作为中国人民的礼物。为了满足捷人民对中国的日益增长的兴趣，在捷汉学家的努力和捷政府的充分支持下，这个中文图书馆终于在布拉格诞生了。
    研究鲁迅著作多年的贝尔塔·克列布索娃博士，是鲁迅图书馆的领导人。她曾将鲁迅的许多著作译为捷文，还写过关于鲁迅著作的论文。去年她曾来我国参加纪念鲁迅逝世二十周年的大会。
    现在鲁迅图书馆约有五万卷藏书。它收集了各类中文书目。藏书每年大约增加五千册。鲁迅图书馆就是这样在不断地扩大。
    鲁迅图书馆的日益充实和发展，也是中捷文化联系的一个具体表现。我国政府和学术机关通过交换或馈赠的方式，不断地将新的书籍送到布拉格。例如，鲁迅图书馆在去年收到了我国赠送的“新青年”杂志的整套合订本。
    现在鲁迅图书馆不仅在有效地为捷克斯洛伐克的汉学家们服务，而且，其他国家的研究人员（主要是人民民主国家的汉学家）也常到这个图书馆访问。图书馆帮助汉学家们研究中国古今文化的各个方面。
    对了解中国感到兴趣的不限于汉学家。每天都有许多大学生、艺术家、新闻工作者、音乐家等等，到鲁迅图书馆收集他们需要的材料。中国留学生也是这个图书馆的经常的读者，他们可以利用那里收藏的外国著作中译本来研究欧洲文学。
    鲁迅图书馆是一个受人欢迎的地方，它为捷克斯洛伐克朋友们了解中国生活搭起了一座桥梁。
