On the Study of the History of Philosophy
Hu Sheng

IV.

In the discussion of the history of philosophy, the issue of philosophical inheritance was raised. The question is posed as follows: On the one hand, it is acknowledged that philosophy has a class nature, and on the other hand, it is acknowledged that philosophy has inheritance. Is this a contradiction? Given the premise of acknowledging the class nature of philosophy, how can the inheritance of philosophy be explained?

To explain the class nature of philosophy, one cannot depart from the fundamental distinction between materialism and idealism. Lenin said in "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" that the parties in modern philosophy "ultimately express the tendencies and ideological systems of mutually opposed classes in modern society," and the philosophical parties that have struggled against each other since ancient times "are essentially idealism and materialism." Thus, the issue of class nature and inheritance is essentially about how to comprehensively understand the inheritance relationship of philosophy in the history of philosophy, where materialism and idealism are mutually opposed and struggle against each other.

There is a simple answer: materialism inherits materialism, and idealism inherits idealism. Marxist dialectical materialism inherits the materialist and dialectical elements in the history of philosophy. This answer does not yet demonstrate the full complexity of inheritance in philosophical thought, and how materialism inherits materialism remains to be explained.

In order to solve this problem, Mr. Feng Youlan proposed that philosophical propositions should be distinguished between their abstract meaning and their concrete meaning (see "On the Inheritance of China's Philosophical Heritage," Guangming Daily, January 8). According to this view, the "concrete meaning" of a philosophical proposition cannot be inherited, but its "abstract meaning" can be inherited. Moreover, "if we focus on the abstract meaning of certain philosophical propositions in the history of philosophy," then it is "useful to all classes." Mr. Feng believes that this can "explain that in philosophical thought, there are components that serve all classes." According to this view, it seems that the relationship between the class nature and inheritance of philosophy has been resolved. The class-based part of philosophical thought cannot be inherited, but as long as the abstract meaning of a philosophical proposition is distinguished from its concrete meaning, one can find the non-class-based component of philosophical thought, which can be inherited.

We believe that Mr. Feng has raised a question worth serious consideration, but his proposed method of solving the problem tends towards a wrong direction. It is wrong because he adopts the most effortless method when a realistic and concrete analysis should be made. Starting from subjectivity and making a simple abstraction in the mind cannot solve practical problems.

It cannot be said that all abstractions are empty talk, but it also cannot be said that all abstractions are scientific. There are scientific abstractions and unscientific abstractions, the difference lies in whether the essence of the object has been grasped. Class nature is an essential attribute of philosophical thought, precisely because all philosophical thought is ultimately either materialistic or idealistic. If we arbitrarily take the philosophical thoughts of various antagonistic classes, abstract their essential attributes in our minds, and summarize some other similarities between them, and then think that this can prove in turn that some philosophical thoughts have no class nature, this can only be said to be a conceptual game.

This method cannot "eliminate" the boundaries between materialism and idealism in philosophy. For example, many philosophers propose that experience is the source of knowledge, and they are talking about either materialistic experience or idealistic experience. But if we say, regardless of materialistic experience or idealistic experience, it is all experience, thus abstracting the characteristics of materialism and the characteristics of idealism to obtain "experience in general" ("abstract meaning" of experience); would the party spirit of philosophy be eliminated because of this? This "experience in general" which is neither materialistic nor idealistic, in fact, cannot be found in any philosophical system. No philosopher regards this "experience in general" as the source of knowledge. This "experience in general" certainly summarizes some commonalities in materialistic experience and idealistic experience, but this commonality does not contain the essential attributes of various philosophical thoughts, and of course it cannot prove that there is a "component" in materialistic empiricism or idealistic empiricism that is neither materialistic nor idealistic.

Let us consider this issue from reality. The inheritance seen in the history of philosophy roughly has the following two situations.

First, it belongs to the fundamental viewpoints of philosophy. Within this scope of inheritance, in fact, it can only be materialism inheriting materialism, and idealism inheriting idealism. The materialistic principle and the idealistic principle are fundamentally opposed, they will stimulate each other's progress in mutual struggle, but mutual inheritance is impossible.

As for materialism inheriting materialism, is Mr. Feng Youlan's abstract method applicable? Let's take an example: ancient materialists regarded the origin of all things either as water, or as fire, or as the "five elements," or as "qi." In Mr. Feng's words, their propositions on the origin of all things each have their "concrete meaning," but their propositions all contain the meaning of taking matter rather than spirit as the entity of the world, which can be said to be the "abstract meaning" of their propositions; thus, modern dialectical materialists have inherited the abstract meaning of these propositions, rather than their concrete meaning. If such an example conforms to Mr. Feng's meaning, then it can be admitted that Mr. Feng's statement is not without reason in this case, because the abstraction made in this example is a scientific abstraction. The reason why later materialism can inherit the materialism of its predecessors in its fundamental viewpoints is because they have essential common ground.

But it must also be pointed out that even in this case, the question of how to inherit cannot be completely solved by relying on Mr. Feng's statement. If Marxists treat ancient materialism in this way, that is, focus only on the "abstract meaning" and put aside the "concrete meaning," then the conclusion obtained is nothing more than that we and these materialists are completely the same in fundamental principles. It was mentioned earlier that studying the history of philosophy with a dogmatic attitude, saying that all materialists are completely the same; this is probably because the abstract and the concrete, the general and the particular, are not combined.

The reason why later materialists want to inherit the materialism of their predecessors is certainly because there is essential common ground between them, but also because they are different from each other in addition to the common ground. If they were completely the same, there would be no such thing as inheritance. The meaning of inheritance is not to take it as it is, but to develop it. Ancient materialists often had some unique arguments that were easy for the masses to understand when explaining their ideas, just as Lenin said of the works of European atheists in the eighteenth century, this is worth learning; of course, ancient materialists also had their shortcomings, which need to be corrected in some aspects, overcoming some of their one-sidedness, making them more complete, and so on. Therefore, to treat the excellent heritage of the predecessors, we must also combine its general meaning with its specific characteristics to study it before we can talk about inheritance.

Second, apart from the fundamental viewpoints of philosophy, there is the issue of inheriting general ideological materials. The heritage of the predecessors in the fundamental viewpoints of philosophy is also a kind of ideological material, but there are also many ideological materials that are not the fundamental viewpoints of philosophy themselves. They can be absorbed into the materialistic philosophical system and become materialistic ideological materials; they can also be absorbed into the idealistic philosophical system and become idealistic ideological materials. In this regard, materialistic philosophy can not only inherit the materialistic philosophy of previous generations, but also critically inherit from the idealistic philosophy of previous generations.

Among the ideological materials of this kind, the easiest to see are the various concepts and categories in philosophy. Every philosophical concept has a principled difference in meaning in materialism and in idealism; Marxist philosophy has given all philosophical concepts a completely scientific content that no previous philosophical thought could compare with, but Marxist philosophy did not put forward a whole set of philosophical concepts and categories again, but inherited the past philosophy. Because the formation of each philosophical concept, the development and change of its content, reflects the development process of human understanding, and if one is isolated from this process of understanding, it is impossible for people to carry out philosophical thinking.

Since idealistic philosophical thought cannot but contain some one-sided reflections on objective reality and human thinking activities (this one-sidedness is exaggerated and given wrong explanations), and since idealistic philosophy has also raised many meaningful questions (but it cannot answer these questions or has given wrong answers); then idealistic philosophy also provides many ideological materials that materialists can absorb and should absorb. Materialism refutes the fundamental viewpoints of idealism and puts forward opposing viewpoints, but at the same time it uses some of the ideological materials provided by the other party and transforms them. This situation is common in the history of philosophy.

The situation of Wang Fuzhi inheriting Zhang Zai through Cheng Zhu, as mentioned by Mr. Feng Youlan in another article ("Two Questions on the Study of Chinese Philosophy History," People's Daily, October 23, 1956), can be explained in this way. Zhang Zai regarded the material "qi" as the origin of all things, while Cheng Zhu said that how "qi" forms all things is determined by "li," and believed that "li is prior to things." The concept of "li" already existed in Zhang Zai's philosophical thought, and Cheng Zhu developed this concept from an idealistic point of view. Later, Wang Fuzhi and others continued to explore the relationship between "li" and "qi" and elaborated the proposition that "li is in things." Wang Fuzhi and others refuted Cheng Zhu on fundamental principles, and also used and transformed the ideological materials provided by Cheng Zhu from a materialistic principle, so they were able to go a little further than Zhang Zai's materialism. Mr. Feng Youlan said well: this is the dialectical process of Wang Fuzhi "passing through Cheng Zhu, but also discarding Cheng Zhu, passing through Cheng Zhu and inheriting Zhang Zai."

Some people say that Wang Yangming's theory of "innate knowledge and ability" contains the meaning of requiring people not to blindly follow and think independently. How should we evaluate this? There is an idealistic understanding of independent thinking, and there is also a materialistic understanding. In Wang Yangming's view, the proposition of independent thinking is permeated with the flavor of subjective idealism. Under certain historical conditions, the advocacy of independent thinking from an idealistic point of view can also play a role in breaking traditional constraints, but taking the so-called innate ideas from the heart as the standard of right and wrong, then independent thinking will actually inevitably turn into its opposite - blind obedience. Therefore, materialists neither obliterate the historical significance of some idealists in proposing independent thinking, nor can they simply accept the idealistic proposition of independent thinking, but must fundamentally transform it, so that independent thinking is based on the recognition of objective laws.

The idealistic philosophy in history has provided many valuable ideological materials, which are of great significance to the development of materialism. Therefore, the more widely the idealist philosophers of the past discussed various issues, the more enriched the content of the materialistic philosophy that was developed to oppose this idealistic philosophy often became.

Dialectics and metaphysics are a principled opposition, so dialectics cannot inherit metaphysics in fundamental viewpoints, just as materialism cannot inherit idealism in fundamental viewpoints. But in the history of philosophy, dialectics has been combined with the idealistic system and become idealistic dialectics. Materialists can absorb its dialectics when criticizing the idealistic theoretical system. This is an ideological material that Marxist materialists consider very important and must critically absorb.

Some people say that the rational elements in idealistic philosophy that can be absorbed are in line with objective reality, so they should be regarded as materialism. This view is wrong. Of course, some idealistic philosophies may contain materialistic views on individual issues that contradict their systems, but we cannot regard all one-sidedly realistic ideas as materialism, because they have been absorbed into the idealistic system, have been given idealistic explanations, and have been infected with the fundamental viewpoints of idealism.

Perhaps some people will say that the issue of inheriting philosophical thought materials mentioned here can be explained by the abstract method mentioned by Mr. Feng Youlan. As long as these ideological materials are isolated from the relationship between materialism and idealism and viewed abstractly, they are precisely the non-partisan components in philosophical thought that can serve all classes. Mr. Feng's article said that Marx accepted dialectics from Hegel by accepting the abstract meaning of dialectics. The development mentioned by Hegel is the development of the absolute idea, while we "take its abstract meaning of development, not its concrete meaning, that is, 'take its development' but not its 'absolute idea.'"

We believe that this simplistic explanation is untenable, and it cannot help us deal with the inheritance problem in practice.

The reason why there are some ideological materials in idealistic philosophy that we can absorb is not because there are materialistic components in it as mentioned above, nor is it because there are components in it that are neither materialistic nor idealistic. There is no concept of "li" in Cheng Zhu philosophy that is neither materialistic nor idealistic, and there is no such neutral independent thinking in Wang Yangming's theory. Similarly, it is impossible to find dialectics in the Hegelian system that is neither materialistic nor idealistic. When we liberate these ideological materials from the idealistic system, we do not turn them into components that are neither materialistic nor idealistic, but we must give them a materialistic explanation and combine them with the fundamental viewpoints of materialism.

The materialists' absorption of certain ideological materials provided by idealistic philosophy is by no means as simple as taking bricks and tiles from an old house and installing them on a new house. The brick in the old house is indeed the brick in the new house, but a certain ideological material must be criticized and transformed when it moves from the idealistic building to the materialistic building. It is necessary to correct the distortions, deformations, and limitations it has suffered in the idealistic system before it is truly useful to us. The founders of Marxism never abandoned Hegel's idealism and took his dialectics as it was, nor did they abandon his absolute ideas and take his development views as they were. They repeatedly emphasized that we should not ignore Hegel's dialectics, and at the same time pointed out "the mystification that dialectics suffered in Hegel's hands" (Marx), "This method, in the form it has in Hegel, is inapplicable" (Engels), and so on.

Therefore, if materialism wants to obtain the ideological materials it needs from idealistic philosophy, it must not rely on the method of abstraction in the mind, but must realistically identify, examine, dissect, and then select, modify, transform, and develop these ideological materials.

If materialists can do this - and Marxist materialists should be able to do this - then the works left by all idealist philosophers in history will be important wealth for us. The reason why Marxism can surpass all past materialists and push materialistic philosophy forward is also an important condition that it is good at critically absorbing various useful materials from idealistic philosophy. Engels once said: "There exists a fundamentally idealistic worldview between the ancient Greeks and us for more than two thousand years... We must know that the question is by no means to wipe out all the ideological content of these two thousand years, but to criticize it, to extract valuable results from the erroneous but inevitable idealistic form under the historical development conditions at that time, from this temporary form." ("Dialectics of Nature")

As long as we can do this, we can even learn something from the works of modern decadent bourgeois philosophy. Lenin called the modern bourgeois philosophy professors "learned stewards of theologians" (while economics professors are "learned stewards of the bourgeoisie"), and believed that "none of them can be believed in a single word when they come into contact with philosophy," but he also said: "The task of Marxists in philosophy and economics is to be good at drawing and transforming the achievements made by these 'stewards' (for example, if you do not use the works of these 'stewards,' you cannot take a step forward in studying new economic phenomena), and to be good at eliminating their reactionary tendencies, to be good at adhering to their own line, and to fight against the forces and classes that are hostile to us in a comprehensive way" ("Materialism and Empirio-criticism"). Lenin's instruction is also applicable to us now. Mr. Zheng Xin mentioned the issue of "estimating modern bourgeois idealists" in the article "Opening up Idealism." For the time being, apart from the situation of the wavering and differentiation in the modern bourgeois idealist philosophical camp, only in terms of the "stewards" mentioned by Lenin, then our answer to this question is: If we only see their identity as "stewards" and forget that they are "learned stewards," and that there is much content in their learning that is worth drawing and transforming, it is wrong. At the same time, if we cannot "be good at eliminating their reactionary tendencies and be good at adhering to their own line" as Lenin said when we are drawing and transforming, it is also wrong.

Regarding the issue of philosophical inheritance, I think we can get a more complete view from this.

Therefore, in the issue of inheriting philosophical heritage, we must not absolutely oppose the two things of acceptance and criticism. We do not take the rude attitude of generally negating without scientific analysis and criticism. We also do not take the method of swallowing whole without scientific analysis and criticism. In general, our achievements in the study of Chinese philosophy history are mostly based on simple descriptions of the philosophical thoughts of the predecessors, and very few truly make Marxist analysis and comments. We should continue to oppose anti-historicism and cannot demand the ancients with the current standards, but this does not mean that we should not comment on the thoughts of the predecessors from the perspective of Marxists. This comment is not only to point out the essence of the wrong viewpoints and expose the internal contradictions of the ideological system, but also to point out the pitfalls and key points that made the predecessors stumble and go astray, to rescue the valuable arguments from various mysterious smokescreens and one-sided distortions, and to clarify many problems that the past philosophers could propose but could not solve. If, after narrating the rational factors of a philosophical thought, we say a few words about some shortcomings due to the limitations of the times, and so on, this cannot be said to be scientific analysis and comment. Only when we have truly made a scientific study of various philosophical thoughts and made correct analysis and comments can the inheritance problem be truly solved. In this way, we can truly absorb the experience of the ideological struggle of the predecessors, and can take the essence from a large amount of heritage, instead of just picking up a few pieces of broken copper and a few iron nails like picking up garbage.

V.

The above explanation on the issue of inheritance can also be used to explain the issue of national characteristics in the history of philosophy.

The history of philosophy of all nations is, in the final analysis, a history of the struggle between materialism and idealism, but not only will the depth and breadth of the struggle not be completely the same, but also the specific issues emphasized will be different, and the same issues will be raised from different angles, not to mention the differences in the arguments and forms of expression. The national characteristics of the history of philosophy are largely related to the specific forms of ideological struggle and the specific conditions of the ideological materials accumulated in the history of the nation, and these are directly related to the history of political struggle and the development of various scientific knowledge of the nation. Marxist philosophy workers engage in ideological work in a social life that is imbued with national cultural traditions. From the point of view of better engaging in the current ideological struggle, they must also express their attitude towards various philosophical tendencies in the history of philosophy of their own nation, must answer various questions raised in the history of philosophy of their own nation, must be good at inheriting all the excellent (materialistic, scientific) traditions in the history of philosophy of their own nation, and be good at using all the ideological materials left by their predecessors that can be used. As long as these national characteristics are indeed based on reality, they can in turn enrich the Marxist treasure house, which is the common wealth of progressive mankind.

Chinese philosophy, in its three thousand years of development, although it has had close contacts with some neighboring countries in the East, has generally been isolated from European philosophy for a long time. This makes it the responsibility of Chinese Marxists to pay more attention to the national characteristics of the history of philosophy. And scientifically and deeply studying the history of Chinese philosophy will certainly be able to contribute to demonstrating the universal truth of Marxism. As for the view that Chinese philosophy is completely different from Western philosophy, and that there is even no such thing as materialism and idealism, we do not agree with it, because it does not conform to the facts.

The preliminary achievements of the scientific study of the history of Chinese philosophy have at least proved that the basic principles of Marxist philosophy history are also fully applicable to China. But at any time, we should not only "eat" by principles. Marxist principles play a guiding role for us, but they can only play a guiding role. It provides correct viewpoints and methods, so that we will not get lost when we go deep into a large number of complex and specific materials. It never replaces specific research.

The founders of Marxism never reserved any simple formulas. And they always struggled against the tendency to turn Marxism into a formula that could be applied. In fact, anyone who treats Marxism with a dogmatic attitude will inevitably distort and distort Marxism, and destroy the principles of Marxism. The founders of Marxism emphasized the unity of theory and practice, and regarded theory as a guide to action. In scientific work, it is necessary to occupy a large amount of material and carry out hard research work. In Engels' words, it is "Our view of history is above all a guide to study, not a means to construct a system in the Hegelian school. The entire history should begin to be re-studied" (Letter to Conrad Schmidt). "Even if it is only to develop the materialistic viewpoint on a single historical example, it is a scientific work that requires years of quiet research, because it is obvious that it is useless to talk about empty words here, and such a task can only be solved by relying on a large amount of historical material that has been critically examined and fully understood." (On Karl Marx's "Critique of Political Economy")

Some people have raised the question of the scope of research in the history of Chinese philosophy. If we talk about the scope that we should pay attention to in the research process, then this scope is not narrow, but very broad. For a thinker, if we only pay attention to the part of his works that is obviously philosophical in nature, and ignore his reflections on various realistic and theoretical issues, it is impossible to explain his philosophical thoughts clearly. For an era, if we only pay attention to the philosophical thoughts expressed in a relatively pure form, and ignore the philosophical thoughts expressed in science, political theory, social views, and literary theory at that time, it is impossible to explain the philosophical trends of that time clearly. The struggle of philosophical thought is often a concentrated expression of the ideological struggles of all aspects of the same era. If we do not understand the state of social productive forces at that time, and the political and ideological dynamics of all classes and strata at that time, the struggle in the philosophical field will not be truly and thoroughly explained. The scope mentioned in a philosophy history textbook cannot but be limited, but the scope that a philosophy historian pays attention to in the research process must be much broader than the limited scope in the philosophy history. We are all dissatisfied with the simplification under dogmatic habits. The real way to overcome simplification is to master rich materials, and resist various tendencies to unilaterally interpret Marxist principles, and conscientiously conduct specific analysis and research from the actual materials under the guidance of Marxist viewpoints and methods. There is no shortcut other than this. (To be continued)

    关于哲学史的研究
    胡绳
    四、
    在哲学史问题的讨论中，提到了哲学上的继承性的问题。问题是这样地提出来的：一方面承认哲学有阶级性，一方面又承认哲学有继承性，这是不是自相矛盾？在承认哲学的阶级性的前提下，究竟怎样说明哲学的继承性？
    要说明哲学的阶级性，不能离开唯物主义和唯心主义的根本区别。列宁在“唯物主义和经验批判主义”中说，现代哲学上的党派“归根结底是表现着现代社会中互相敌对的阶级的趋向和思想体系”，而自古以来互相斗争的哲学党派“实质上就是唯心主义和唯物主义”。由此可见，所谓阶级性和继承性的问题，实质上就是在唯物主义和唯心主义互相敌对、互相斗争的哲学史上，如何全面地了解哲学的继承关系的问题。
    有一种简单的答复：唯物主义继承唯物主义，唯心主义继承唯心主义。马克思主义的辩证唯物主义哲学继承哲学史上的唯物主义因素和辩证法因素。——这个答复还不能表明哲学思想的继承中的全部复杂内容，而且唯物主义怎样继承唯物主义也还有待于说明。
    冯友兰先生为了解决这个问题，提出了对哲学命题要区别其抽象意义和具体意义的说法（见
  “中国哲学遗产的继承问题”光明日报1月8日）。按照这种说法，一个哲学命题的“具体意义”是不可以继承的，其“抽象意义”则是可以继承的。而且“哲学史中的某些哲学命题，我们若专注重于其抽象意义”，那就是“对一切阶级都有用”的。冯先生认为由此可以“说明哲学思想中，有为一切阶级服务的成分”。——根据这种说法，似乎哲学的阶级性和继承性的关系问题已经得到了解决。哲学思想中有阶级性的部分是不能继承的，但只要把哲学命题的抽象意义从它的具体意义中区别出来，就是找到了哲学思想中没有阶级性的成分，那就是可以继承的。
    我们认为，冯先生提出了一个值得认真考虑的问题，但是他所设想的解决问题的方法是趋向于一个错误的方向。其所以是错误，就因为在应当实事求是地作具体分析的时候，却采用了一种最省力的办法。从主观出发在头脑里做一次简单的抽象，这是不能解决实际问题的。
    不能认为一切抽象都是空话，但也不能认为一切抽象都是科学的。有科学的抽象，也有非科学的抽象，其区别就在是否抓住了对象的本质内容。阶级性对于哲学思想是一种本质的属性，这就因为，一切哲学思想，归根结底不是唯物主义的，就是唯心主义的。如果任意地把各个敌对阶级的哲学思想拿来，在我们的头脑里把它们的本质属性抽象掉，把它们之间的其他某种相似处概括起来，就以为由此可以反过来证明有一部分哲学思想没有阶级性，这只能说是一种观念游戏。
    用这种办法，是“消除”不了哲学上的唯物主义和唯心主义的界限的。例如有许多哲学家提出经验是知识的来源这一命题，他们说的不是唯物主义的经验，就是唯心主义的经验。但是如果我们说，不管唯物主义的经验还是唯心主义的经验，总之都是经验，于是抽象掉唯物主义的特征和唯心主义的特征而得到了“经验一般”（“抽象意义”上的经验）；哲学的党性难道就会因此而消除么？这种既不是唯物主义的也不是唯心主义的“经验一般”，事实上在任何哲学体系中都是找不到的。没有一个哲学家把这种“经验一般”看做知识的来源。这种“经验一般”诚然也概括了唯物主义的经验和唯心主义的经验中的某种共同性，但这种共同性并不包含各种哲学思想的本质属性，当然不能由此证明在唯物主义经验论或唯心主义经验论中间包含着一个既非唯物主义又非唯心主义的“成分”。
    让我们从实际出发来考虑这个问题。从哲学史上看到的继承，大体上有如下两种情形。
    第一，属于哲学根本观点的。在这个范围内的继承，事实上，只能是唯物主义继承唯物主义，唯心主义继承唯心主义。唯物主义原则和唯心主义原则是根本对立的，它们在相互斗争中会刺激对方前进，但是相互继承是不可能的。
    就唯物主义继承唯物主义来说，冯友兰先生所说的抽象方法是否适用呢？试举一例：古代唯物论者把万物的本源或看做是水，或看做是火，或看做是“五行”，或看做是“气”，用冯先生的说法，就是他们对万物本源的命题均各有其“具体意义”，但他们的命题都包含着以物质而不是以精神为世界实体的意思，这可以说是他们的命题的“抽象意义”；由此可见，现代辩证唯物论者在这点上是继承了这些命题的抽象意义，而不是继承其具体意义。——如果这样的例子符合于冯先生的意思，那么可以承认，冯先生的说法在这种场合不是没有道理的，因为在这例子中所做的抽象是一种科学的抽象。后来的唯物论之所以能在根本观点上继承先驱的唯物论，就因为它们有在本质上的共同点。
    但是还必须指出，就在这种场合，也不能依靠冯先生的说法来完全解决如何继承的问题。如果马克思主义者用这办法来对待古代唯物论，即专注意于“抽象意义”，而把“具体意义”撇开，那么所得到的结论无非是，我们和这些唯物论者在根本原则上是完全一样的。前面说过，用教条主义态度研究哲学史，把一切唯物主义者都说成好像完全一样；这恐怕就是因为没有把抽象和具体、一般和特殊结合起来的原故。
    后来的唯物论者之所以要继承先驱的唯物论，固然因为他们之间有在本质上的共同点，但也因为他们之间除了共同点以外，还有所不同。如果完全相同，就无所谓继承。继承的意思不是照样拿来，而一定要加以发展。古代唯物论者为阐明自己的思想时，常常有一些独到的、为群众易于理解的论证，就像列宁对于欧洲十八世纪的无神论者的作品所说的那样，这是值得我们学习的；当然，古代唯物论者也有他们的缺点，那就需要在某些方面给以纠正，克服其某种片面性，使之得到更完满的形态等等。因此，对待前人的优秀遗产，也必须把它的一般意义及其具体特征结合起来研究，才说得上继承。
    第二，在哲学的根本观点以外，还有一般的思想资料的继承问题。前人在哲学根本观点上的遗产也是一种思想资料，但是还有很多思想资料，本身并不就是哲学的根本观点，它们可以吸收在唯物主义哲学体系中，成为唯物主义的思想资料；也可以吸收在唯心主义哲学体系中，成为唯心主义的思想资料。在这方面，唯物主义哲学不仅可以继承前代的唯物主义哲学，而且也可以向前代的唯心主义哲学批判地有所继承。
    属于这类思想资料的，最容易看到的就是哲学中的各种概念、范畴。每一个哲学概念，在唯物主义那里和在唯心主义那里的含意有原则上的不同；马克思主义哲学使一切哲学概念获得了以往任何哲学思想所不能比的完全科学的内容，但是马克思主义哲学并不是重新提出来整套的哲学概念和范畴，而正是继承了以往的哲学。因为每一个哲学概念的形成，其内容的发展和变革，都反映着人类认识的发展过程，如果同这个认识过程隔绝开来，人们就不可能进行哲学的思维。
    既然唯心主义哲学思想也不能不包含着对于客观实际和人的思维活动的某些片面的反映（这片面是被夸大了，并且被加上错误的解释），既然唯心主义哲学也曾经提出了许多有意义的问题（但它不能解答这些问题或作了错误的解答）；那么唯心主义哲学也就提供了许多为唯物主义者所可以吸收，也应当吸收的思想资料。唯物主义驳斥了唯心主义的根本观点，提出了与之对立的观点，但同时又利用了对方所提供的某些思想资料，加以改造，这种情形在哲学史上是常有的。
    冯友兰先生在另一篇文章（“关于中国哲学史研究的两个问题”，人民日报1956年10月23日）所说的王夫之经过程朱而继承张载的情形就可以这样来说明。张载把物质性的“气”看做万物的本源，而程朱则说“气”之如何形成万物是由“理”来决定的，认为“理在事先”。张载的哲学思想中已经有“理”这一概念，程朱在唯心主义观点上发展了这一概念。后来的王夫之等人继续探讨
  “理”和“气”的关系，发挥了“理在事中”的主张。王夫之等人是在根本原则上驳斥了程朱，而又从唯物主义原则出发利用和改造了程朱提供的思想资料，所以他们能够比张载的唯物主义走得更远一点。冯友兰先生说得好：这里是王夫之“经过程朱，而又撇开程朱，经过程朱而又继承张载”的辩证过程。
    有人说，王阳明的“良知良能”学说包含着要求人不盲从、独立思考的意思。对此，我们应如何估价呢？对于独立思考，有唯心主义的了解，也有唯物主义的了解。在王阳明那里，独立思考的命题浸透着主观唯心主义的气味。在一定的历史条件下，从唯心主义出发的独立思考的主张也可以起打破传统束缚的作用，但是以所谓发自内心的天赋观念为是非的标准，那么独立思考实际上必然会转变为其反对物——盲从。所以唯物主义者既不抹煞某些唯心主义者提出独立思考的历史意义，也不能简单地接受唯心主义的独立思考的命题，而必须加以根本改造，使独立思考建立在承认客观规律的基础上面。
    历史上的唯心主义哲学提供了许多有价值的思想资料，这对于唯物主义的发展是有重要意义的。所以前代的唯心主义哲学家们越是广泛地讨论了各种问题，那么反对这种唯心主义哲学而发展起来的唯物主义哲学内容也常常能够越加丰富。
    辩证法和形而上学是一种原则性的对立，所以辩证法不能够在根本观点上继承形而上学，正像唯物主义不能够在根本观点上继承唯心主义一样。但是在哲学史上辩证法曾经同唯心主义体系相结合而成为唯心主义的辩证法。唯物论者在批判唯心主义的理论体系时，可以吸取其辩证法，这是马克思主义唯物论者认为十分重要，必须批判地吸取的思想资料。
    有人说，唯心主义哲学中的可供吸取的合理要素是同客观实际相符合的，所以就应当把它看做唯物主义。这种看法是不对的。固然在有的唯心主义哲学中，可能包含着同它的体系相矛盾的在个别问题上的唯物主义观点，但是我们却不能把一切片面地符合实际的思想都看做是唯物主义，因为它们被吸取在唯心主义体系中，已经被加上了唯心主义的解释，浸染了唯心主义的根本观点。
    也许有人会说，这里所说的哲学思想资料的继承问题就可以用冯友兰先生所说的抽象方法来解释。只要把这些思想资料同唯物主义和唯心主义的关系隔绝开来，抽象起来看，它们正是在哲学思想中能够为一切阶级服务的、无党性的成分。继承就是继承这个成分。冯先生的文章中说，马克思从黑格尔接受辩证法就是接受辩证法的抽象意义，黑格尔说的发展是绝对观念的发展，我们则“取其发展的抽象意义，而不是取其具体意义，就是说，‘取其发展’而不取其‘绝对观念’”。
    我们认为，这种简单化的解释是不能成立的，它并不能帮助我们实际处理继承问题。
    唯心主义哲学中之所以有一些思想资料可以让我们吸取，并不是像上面所说，因为在那里面有唯物主义的成分，也不是因为在那里面有既非唯物，又非唯心的成分。在程朱哲学中并没有既非唯物，又非唯心的“理”的观念，在王阳明学说中也没有这样的中性的独立思考，同样的，要在黑格尔体系中找到既不唯物又不唯心的辩证法也是找不到的。当我们把这些思想资料从唯心主义体系中解放出来以后，也不是使它变成既非唯物又非唯心的成分，而是要给以唯物主义的解释，使它和唯物主义的根本观点相结合起来。
    唯物主义者吸收唯心主义哲学所提供的某种思想资料，绝不是很简单地好像从旧房子上拆下砖瓦来安到新房子上一样。旧房子上的那块砖瓦的确就是新房子上的这块砖瓦，但某种思想资料从唯心主义大厦上移到唯物主义大厦上来，必须经过批判和改造。要把它在唯心主义体系中所受到的歪曲、变形、限制改正过来，然后才真正对我们有用。马克思主义创始人对于黑格尔决不是抛弃其唯心主义而照原样地取其辩证法，抛弃其绝对观念而照原样地取其发展观点。他们再三强调不要忽视黑格尔的辩证法，同时指出了“辩证法在黑格尔手中所遭受的神秘化”（马克思），“这个方法就它在黑格尔那里所具有的形式来说，是不适用的”（恩格斯），等等。
    因此，唯物主义要从唯心主义哲学中取得为自己所需用的思想资料，决不能靠头脑中抽象一下的办法，而必须切实地对这些思想资料进行鉴别、审查、剖视，并从而进行选别、修正、改造、发展。
    唯物主义者如果能够这样做——马克思主义唯物主义者是应当能够这样做的，——那么，历史上一切唯心主义哲学家遗留下来的著作对于我们就会是重要的财富。马克思主义之所以能够超过过去的一切唯物主义者而把唯物主义哲学推向前进，善于从唯心主义哲学批判地吸取各种有用的资料，也是重要条件之一。恩格斯曾这样说：“古代希腊人和我们中间存在着两千多年的本质上是唯心论的世界观，……要知道问题决不是把这两千多年的全部思想内容一笔勾消就算完事，而是要批判它，要从错误的但在当时的历史发展条件下是不可避免的唯心论形态中、从这个暂时的形态中剥取有价值的成果。”（自然辩证法）
    只要能够这样做，我们甚至也能够从现代腐朽的资产阶级哲学的著作学到点东西。列宁把现代资产阶级的哲学教授称做“神学家的有学问的管事”（而经济学教授则是“资产阶级的有学问的管事”），并且认为，他们“在一接触到哲学的时候就没有一个有一句话是可以相信的”，但是他又说：“马克思主义者在哲学上和经济学上的任务，就在要善于汲取和改造这些‘管事们’所作出的成绩（例如，如果不利用这些‘管事们’的著作，你们就不能在研究新的经济现象上前进一步），——并且要善于排除他们的反动倾向，善于坚持自己的路线，并且跟敌视我们的势力和阶级进行全线的斗争”（“唯物主义和经验批判主义”）。列宁的这个指示，对我们现在也是适用的。郑昕先生在“开放唯心主义”一文中曾提到“对现代资产阶级的唯心主义者的估计”的问题。暂且把现代资产阶级唯心主义哲学阵营的动摇和分化的情形除外，只就列宁所说的“管事”而言，那么我们对这问题的答复就是：如果只看到他们的“管事”的身份，而忘记了他们是“有学问的管事”，他们的学问中有许多内容值得我们来汲取和改造，那是错误的，同时如果在我们进行汲取和改造的时候，不能像列宁所说的那样，“善于排除他们的反动倾向，善于坚持自己的路线”，那也是错误的。
    关于哲学上的继承问题，我以为，可以由此得到比较完全的看法。
    因此，在继承哲学遗产的问题上，我们断不能把接受和批判这两件事绝对地对立起来。不经过科学的分析和批判而一概否定，这种粗暴的态度是我们所不取的。不经过科学的分析和批判而谈接受，这种囫囵吞枣的办法也是我们所不取的。我们在中国哲学史研究上的成绩，一般说来，还是以单纯描述前人的哲学思想为多，而真正做马克思主义的分析和评论的很少。我们应当继续反对反历史主义，不能以现在的标准要求古人，但这并不是说，不要用马克思主义者的眼光来评论前人的思想。这种评论不仅是要指出错误观点的本质、揭发思想体系内部的矛盾，而且要点明使前人失足和迷途的陷坑和关键，要把有价值的论点从各种神秘的烟幕和片面性的歪曲中挽救出来，要阐明过去的哲学家虽然能够提出却不能加以解决的许多问题。如果只是在叙述了一家哲学思想的合理因素以后，再说几句由于时代的限制，所以还有某种缺点，未可深责等等，这说不上是科学的分析和评论。只有在我们真正对于各种哲学思想作了科学的研究，作出正确的分析和评论的时候，继承问题才能真正解决。这样，我们才能真正吸取前人思想斗争的经验，并且能从大量遗产中取其菁华，而不是像拣垃圾似地只是拣来几块破铜，几只铁钉。五、
    上面关于继承问题的说明也可以用来说明哲学史的民族特点的问题。
    各民族的哲学史，归根结底，都是唯物主义和唯心主义斗争的历史，但是不仅斗争的深广程度不会完全一样，而且所着重的具体问题也会不同，对同样的问题还会从不同的角度提出，更不用说所提出的论证和表现形式的不同了。哲学史的民族特点在很大程度上是同这一民族在历史上所经历的思想斗争的具体形态和所积累的思想资料的具体状况有关的，而这些又和这一民族的政治斗争的历史和各门科学知识的发展状况直接有关。马克思主义哲学工作者在浸染着民族文化传统的社会生活中从事思想工作，从更好地从事当前的思想斗争这一点上来看，也必须对本民族哲学史上的各种哲学倾向表示态度，必须答复本民族哲学史上提出的各种问题，必须善于继承本民族哲学史上的一切优秀的（唯物主义的、科学的）传统，并且善于利用先人留下的可以利用的一切思想资料。只要这种民族的特点，的确是有现实的基础的，那么它也就能够反过来丰富作为进步人类的共同财富的马克思主义宝库。
    中国哲学，在其三千年的发展过程中，虽然曾经同东方的有些邻国有密切的交往，但是大体上说来，是长期同欧洲的哲学隔绝着的。这就使得中国马克思主义者有责任更多地注意哲学史的民族特点。而科学地、深入地研究中国哲学史，也一定能够对于论证马克思主义的普遍真理有所贡献。至于那种认为中国哲学同西方哲学彻头彻尾地不同，甚至根本没有什么唯物主义和唯心主义这一类看法，是我们所不同意的，因为那是同事实不相符合的。
    对中国哲学史的科学研究的初步成就，至少已经证明马克思主义哲学史的基本原则对于中国也是完全适用的。但是在任何时候，我们都不要只靠原则“吃饭”。马克思主义原则对我们起着指导的作用，但它也只能起指导的作用。它提供了正确的观点和方法，使我们在深入到大量的纷繁复杂的具体材料中的时候，不至于迷失方向。它决不代替具体的研究。
    马克思主义的创始人从来没有预约过任何简易的公式。而且总是同企图把马克思主义变成可以套用的公式的倾向做斗争。事实上，凡是用教条主义的态度来对待马克思主义的人一定会弄到使马克思主义变形、歪曲，而破坏了马克思主义原则。马克思主义创始人强调的是理论和实践的一致，把理论当做行动的指南，而在科学工作上，就是要大量占有材料，进行艰苦的研究工作。用恩格斯的话来说，就是，“我们的历史观首先是个进行研究工作的指南，而不是一种用以按黑格尔学派方式构造体系的手段。全部历史都应该开始重新研究”（致康·施米特信）。“即令只要在一个单独的历史实例上发挥唯物主义观点，也是一种需要多年静心研究的科学工作，因为很明显，在这里讲空话是无济于事的，这样的任务只有依靠大量的、经过批判审查了的、完全领会了的历史材料才可解决。”（论卡尔·马克思著“政治经济学批判”一书）
    有人提出了中国哲学史的研究范围的问题。如果说在研究过程中我们所应当注意的范围，那么这个范围不是很窄，而是很广的。对于一个思想家，如果只注意他的明显地属于哲学性质的一部分著作，而不管他对各种现实问题和理论问题的反映，是不可能把他的哲学思想说清楚的。对于一个时代，如果只注意用比较纯粹的形式表现出来的哲学思想，而不管当时表现在科学、政治理论、社会观点、文艺理论中间的哲学思想，也是不可能把当时的哲学思潮说清楚的。哲学思想斗争常常是同时代的各方面思想斗争的集中表现，如果不了解当时社会生产力发展的状况，当时各阶级、阶层的政治、思想各方面的动态，哲学领域内的斗争是不会得到真正透彻的说明的。一本哲学史教科书中所说到的范围当然不能不是有限的，但是一个哲学史家在研究过程中所注意的范围，一定要比哲学史中的有限范围广泛得多。我们都不满意于在教条主义习气下的简单化。真正克服简单化的方法就是掌握丰富的材料，并且抵制各种把马克思主义原则片面化的倾向，认真地在马克思主义的观点和方法指导下从实际材料出发进行具体的分析和研究。除此以外，任何捷径是不会有的。  （续完）
