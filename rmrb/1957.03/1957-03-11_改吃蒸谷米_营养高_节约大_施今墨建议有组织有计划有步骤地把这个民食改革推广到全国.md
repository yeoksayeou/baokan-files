Increasing production and practicing economy are ongoing national movements. Comrade Liu Shaoqi instructed at the Eighth National Congress that we must strive to accumulate every yuan of construction funds. Now, in our daily lives, we can clearly save a very large sum for the country's socialist industrialization funds simply by everyone switching to parboiled rice. This is not only beneficial for nutrition but also makes a very significant contribution to the national economy. We medical colleagues have already exerted considerable effort in promoting the nutritional aspects of parboiled rice. Due to time constraints, I will only make a simple suggestion from the standpoint of increasing production and practicing economy.

Changing to Parboiled Rice Can Save Billions of Yuan a Year

The economic benefits of parboiled rice are very extensive, such as in terms of storage, processing, application, transportation, disaster relief, etc. Any aspect saves or increases a very large amount compared to ordinary rice. These amounts have long been proven scientifically and practically. Due to time constraints, I will not list them one by one. Regarding the comparison of cooked rice yield, the "Zhejiang Literature" states that farmers are not full even after eating two sheng of white rice, but one sheng of parboiled rice is enough. Recently, after I experimented, I found that it can indeed increase the cooked rice yield by several tenths. Rice is stored in my home and can be used for experiments. From various aspects, if we calculate that it can save one-third of the grain, that is, for every hundred jin of paddy, parboiled grain can save more than thirty-three jin compared to un-parboiled grain, which is not an overestimate. According to the first Five-Year Plan, the total rice production this year will be 163.54 billion jin. The price of paddy varies in different regions, with some exceeding one jiao per jin and others less. For ease of calculation, let's use an average price of one jiao per jin, which gives a total annual value of over 16.3 billion yuan. Adding the annual increase in grain production, we can save almost two years' worth of grain in five years. That is, within the five years of developing the national economic construction, it is estimated that the country can strive to save 32.708 billion yuan. This amount is equal to 42% of the total expenditure of 76.64 billion yuan for economic and cultural education undertakings during the first Five-Year Plan, which is also equal to six times the investment of 5.324 billion yuan for the first phase of the Yellow River project. Even if this calculation is just an approximation, and it is not easy to achieve immediately, achieving half or a fraction of this would make it the top project in the current national campaign to increase production and practice economy.

The May 1954 issue of "Science Bulletin" encouraged people to "save food and be frugal," stating that if each person in the country eats four liang more of grain per day, it would consume 40 billion jin more of grain per year. Increasing grain production by 40 billion jin per year is very difficult, but consuming 40 billion jin more is easy. We should promote economy according to the spirit that increasing production and practicing economy are the source of ensuring high-speed socialist expanded reproduction. This statement is very correct, but it is far from the reality. It seems that people cannot save more on food, and it may not be easy to achieve this requirement. However, as long as everyone in the country switches to parboiled rice or other heat-treated grains, then on average, each person can save about four liang of grain per day. Therefore, we can say that switching to parboiled rice nationwide can save billions of yuan a year.

In recent years, a very few people have held conservative ideas based on reasons such as people's lack of habit and have not paid attention to this matter. I hope they will go to the people to see the actual situation and explain it using scientific methods, and they will surely be awakened and willing to participate in this great economy movement.

Direction of Promotion

In recent years, many people know that parboiled rice must be promoted, but because the direction has not been determined, it makes people feel unfathomable. Parboiled rice is about to become a historical term. This is entirely a matter of thinking. Several years ago, several medical colleagues in China had already solemnly verified that the nutritional value of parboiled rice made in the United States and India is not as high as that of our domestically made parboiled rice and is not easily digested. Therefore, we should first reverse the old idea that "imported products are all good." From the perspective of economy, we should determine that the adoption of domestic methods is the only direction for future development, for two reasons:

1. Lowest Cost: The cost of machine-made products is certainly lower than that of hand-made products. This is an unchangeable law, but for parboiled rice production in China at present, domestic methods have some basis to rely on, so they are more cost-effective than mechanized methods. Producing 100,000 jin of parboiled rice per day using domestic methods only requires a few stoves and pots. All equipment included costs only about 2,000 yuan, while machines require 200,000 or even millions of yuan. For daily expenses, domestic methods cost 2.6 jiao per hundred jin, including steaming, drying, labor, fuel, and depreciation of equipment (Sichuan only needs 4.1 yuan per 10,000 jin, which is even cheaper). In 1953, the cost of Shanghai's mechanized methods was three times this. Moreover, for the comprehensive promotion of parboiled rice, many of the original equipment and materials can be used as much as possible, without the need for separate manufacturing, and the cost can be further reduced, even to zero. This is a clearly comparable fact, but some people or regions are waiting for the arrival of machines, as if spending tens or hundreds of thousands of yuan for the sake of face is not a big deal. The root of this thinking is consistent with the worship of palace-style architecture a few years ago.

2. Faster Production: Without understanding the actual situation, one might suspect that domestic methods have a slow and small parboiling capacity, which is not suitable for the people's needs. In fact, it is the opposite. According to the actual output of parboiling workshops in the Taihu Lake counties, each parboiling stove can produce 40,000 to 50,000 jin per day, and up to 100,000 jin if calculated on a 24-hour basis. Therefore, if Shanghai is willing to use domestic methods, only 60 to 70, at most 100, parboiling stoves are needed to solve the problem of 6 million people switching to parboiled rice all year round. The equipment cost is only a few tens of thousands of yuan, and the installation time is only one or two months, which can complete this very important task. If machines are used, it may take several years before they can be put into production. According to an estimate by a professor at a university in Beijing, it is necessary to build 500 to 1,000 large factories to parboil rice nationwide. Such a large infrastructure project may not be easily completed in ten or eight years, but if domestic parboiling is widely used nationwide, it can definitely be achieved within one or two years once organized. Which is faster and which is slower can be compared. As for the sunlight problem, there are also many solutions. The drying yards do not need much space and do not need to be considered. Everyone should know how much steel and hardware would be consumed if machines are used to heat-treat such a large amount of paddy, which can be calculated item by item. China now relies on imports for 40% of its steel and hardware, and there was a shortage in the second half of last year. Now, it is clear that it is temporarily unnecessary to switch to machines, and the same can complete this important task, and the domestic method is much faster in terms of time. Everyone should save this huge consumable expense for the people.

We should know that grain heat treatment methods have long been popular among the Soviet people, but it was not until after several Five-Year Plans, when machine power was greatly surplus, that the state promoted machine heat treatment. We should also know that the Soviet Union still paid attention to the use of existing animal power during the nationwide agricultural mechanization. Therefore, China should definitely improve on domestic methods and utilize all existing equipment when promoting parboiled rice, and should not waste the country's limited steel and hardware. First of all, everyone should not mistakenly believe that domestic parboiling is like traditional Chinese medicine and medicine that was regarded as backward and unscientific waste, in order to promote it.

While vigorously promoting it within a limited time, we should also investigate and study the heat treatment of grain in the country. If we don't let go and do it, the first Five-Year Plan is coming to an end, and the second Five-Year Plan can easily be let go. It is not good for the people. If you think the direction is right, I hope you will start doing it.

We are by no means satisfied with the domestic method of large pots and buckets, but at present, in order to save huge equipment funds and a large amount of steel machinery, and hoping that various places will put into production in the shortest possible time, and quickly save tens of billions of yuan a year for the country, we do not avoid the suspicion of being backward and suggest that the unsightly domestic method be temporarily used as a pioneer. I hope that like the Soviet Union, after several Five-Year Plans, the self-produced steel machinery is already large, and agricultural mechanization is quite common. Then, it is a matter of course to see parboiling stations or mobile parboiling plants facing each other in the fields.

Practical Ways to Promote

Promoting parboiled rice to the whole country is an epoch-making food reform. It seems that there are thousands of threads, and it cannot be rushed. Since the direction has been determined, as long as the power of organization is used, success is truly "easier than turning your hand." At present, there must be two types of organizations for the essential methods of promotion:

1. Organizations among Farmers: Organizing farmers to parboil their own rice is the most economical and reasonable method. Now, all the labor power of farmers in the country is concentrated in agricultural cooperatives. As long as methods are formulated, with a little training, dividing into teams and groups, so that each group parboils its own paddy, it can be completely steamed and dried in a few days each year. Usually, when harvesting rice, there is more than a month of sunny days, and there is no worry about the sun. During the autumn harvest, scattered miscellaneous firewood in the countryside can be picked up everywhere, and the fuel used for parboiling does not cost any money. Drying yards are originally available in every household, and other utensils can also be used. Parboiling stoves can be built with mud, and two stoves can be built in one working day, or they can be built in larger sizes. Mud construction can also be used for several years. As long as there is a call, the farmers of the country will gladly respond, because mobilizing farmers to steam themselves, paying public grain and selling it to the state, can all use steamed grain. In this way, it is beneficial for both the country and the farmers. Originally, farmers must dry the paddy to a certain specification before handing it over to the state. This drying work costs 6 fen per hundred jin of labor per drying. On average, raw grain is calculated as being dried twice, and the labor cost is already considerable. If the farmers steam the grain themselves, then no matter how wet the grain is, it can be cut and steamed without drying first. After steaming, it only needs to be dried once, and the saved drying labor cost is almost equal to half of the total parboiling cost. Whether it is to save expenses or to speed up production, organizing the vast number of farmers to steam their own grain is probably the most practical way to promote it.

2. Administrative Organization: Administrative organization is the basis of all organizations. Organizing the vast number of farmers to shoulder such a large task is by no means something that a part of the business departments can handle alone. The main reason why the promotion of parboiled rice has not progressed in recent years is the lack of an organization to promote this cause. Because this cause involves a wide range of aspects, it is not only closely related to six or seven ministries under the State Council, but also related to medical science. Therefore, it is necessary to concentrate the manpower of all aspects and jointly bear the responsibility of promoting it. First of all, there must be an organization. Last year, in order to decide on the implementation plan, the Chinese Academy of Sciences specially established a Science Planning Commission under the State Council to plan everything. In recent years, the advanced oil extraction method has also been promoted by a special central agency. Now, the promotion of parboiled rice and other grain heat treatment is much more important than oil, so a Grain Heat Treatment Promotion Committee should be established under the direct leadership of the State Council to be responsible for deciding on the plan and mobilizing farmers. In a few years, it can definitely promote the whole country. The committee should integrate the intelligence and material resources of all aspects, and the talents who have experience in this area should be accommodated. During the period of economy and reorganization, no new institutions should be added, but it seems that the organization specially established for the task of large-scale increase in production should not abandon the great interests because of a very small amount of expenses.

Let the People Not Wait in Vain Anymore

In recent years, due to grain storage, supply, habits, and other reasons, the people in various places are increasingly in need of parboiled rice, especially the thousands of young people who are recuperating from illness in schools and construction sites are also waiting to switch to parboiled rice to solve their nutritional problems. However, this rice is almost extinct in the parboiling areas, and the people cannot help but feel disappointed after hoping for it. We have received a lot of feedback and are honestly reporting it on behalf of them. Based on actual needs, we suggest some practical ways. Two hopes are attached:

1. I hope that the government will not only attach importance to it, but also put it into practical action. The first step of action is in organization, is in a reasonable central organization, and no longer empty words are emphasized. The first Five-Year Plan has reached the end, and tens of billions of yuan that can be saved every year must be strived for.

2. I hope that local newspapers and periodicals will constantly promote it so that everyone knows it, and the people will easily rise up to implement it. Recalling more than 30 years ago, Mr. Sun Yat-sen mobilized the newspapers in Shanghai to sacrifice one page every day to promote armaments, saying that it would definitely succeed in three months. We now hope that newspapers and periodicals will attach importance to this cause, which is closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and help it succeed.

    改吃蒸谷米　营养高　节约大
    施今墨建议有组织有计划有步骤地把这个民食改革推广到全国
    增产节约是国家经常性的运动，刘少奇同志在八大会中指示我们要为积累每一元的建设资金而奋斗。现在我们每个人每天生活中，明明可以节约一笔数字十二分巨大的国家社会主义工业化资金，就是大家改吃了蒸谷米，不仅对于营养上有好处，对于国民经济马上有非常巨大的贡献。我们医务同人对于蒸谷米营养方面的宣传，已尽过相当的力量，现因时间关系，只从增产节约立场，作一个简单的建议。
    改吃蒸谷米一年能节约几十亿元
    蒸谷米在经济上的效用是非常广泛的，如在保管上、加工上、应用上、储运上、救灾上种种方面，任何一点都比普通米能节省或增出非常巨大的数字，这些数目早经科学和实用上证明，时间所限，不及一一列举。关于出饭量的比较，吾浙文献上说农民吃白米二升还不饱，改吃蒸谷米一升许已够，最近我经过尝试，见确可增饭十之几成，米存吾家，可供实验。从各种方面来合计，算它能节约三分之一的粮数，就是每一百斤稻谷，蒸过的谷，比之没有蒸过的谷，结果能省三十三斤多，是并不多算的。根据第一个五年计划，到今年稻的总产量为一千六百三十五点四亿斤，稻谷的价格，有的地区超过一角一斤，有的是不到，今为便于计算，就以每斤谷平均值一角计，是全年总值一百六十三亿多元，再加上逐年粮食增产之数，五年差不多可省到二年之粮，就是在发展国民经济建设五年之内，估计全国可能争取节约到三百二十七点零八亿元，此数等于第一个五年内国家对于经济事业和文化教育事业的支出总数七百六十六点四亿元的42％，也就等于黄河第一期工程投资五十三亿二千四百万元的六倍。就当这个计算不过约数，粗枝大叶，不容易马上做到，但能争取到一半或几分之一的成就，已可居目前全国增产节约项目之第一位。
    1954年5月号科学通报勉励人民“省吃俭用”，谓全国每人每日多吃四两粮食，每年就要多消费四百亿斤粮食，每年增产四百亿斤粮食是很不容易的，而多消费四百亿斤粮食是轻而易举的，应当根据增产节约是保证高速度的社会主义扩大再生产的泉源的精神，提倡节约。这样说法，是很对的，但与事实则距离很远，人民对于食粮似无可再多省，恐怕不容易达到这个要求。但是只要全国每人改吃了蒸谷米或其他热处理过的粮食，那么每天各人平均起来，恰好可以省吃四两左右的粮食。所以，我们可以说全国改吃了蒸谷米，就可节约几十亿元一年。
    几年以来，也有极少数人以人民不习惯等理由，抱保守思想，对此事进行，未加注意，希望他们到民间去看看实际情况，并用科学方法来解释，则一定翻然觉悟，愿参加这项节约大运动了。
    推广的方向
    近年很多人知道蒸谷米的必须推广，因为方向没有确定，使人莫测高深，蒸谷米快成为历史上的名词了。这完全是思想问题。在几年前，国内几位医务同人，早已郑重的化验证明美国及印度制的蒸谷米，营养价值都不如我国土法制的高，并且不易消化，所以我们首先应该扭转舶来品“样样好”的旧思想。再从节约方面来说，更应确定采用土法为今后发展的唯一方向，理由有二：
    一、成本最轻　机器成品的成本，当然比手工业成品为低廉，这是不变的规律，但在目前我国蒸谷米制造来说，因为土法有一些基础可依，所以比机制为上算。同样每天生产十万斤蒸谷米，土法只要一灶数锅，一切设备统统在内，不过二千元左右，机器则需二十万甚至几十万元。日常用费，土法百斤，连蒸带晒，人工燃料以至器具折旧都在内为二角六分（四川每万斤只需四元一角，更为便宜），1953年上海机制费用要三倍于此。况且全面的推广蒸谷米，有很多的原有设备和器材可以尽量利用，无须另制，成本更可减低，甚至可以不费一钱。这明明可以对比的事实，但有的人或有的地区专等机器之来临，好像为了面子好看，花上几十百万元，太不算回事，这种思想根源与几年前崇拜宫殿式建筑是一致的。
    二、生产又快　不了解实际情况，不免要疑心土法蒸谷能力既慢且小，配不上人民需要，实则适得其反。根据太湖各县蒸谷坊的实际产量，每只蒸灶，一天可生产四、五万斤，倘以二十四小时计，可达十万斤。所以像上海市倘肯用土法制造，只需六、七十只蒸灶，至多一百只，可以解决六百万人的常年改吃蒸谷米问题，设备费用不过几万元，安装时间不过一、二个月，可以完成这一非常重大的任务，倘用机器恐要几年之后才能投入生产。据北京某大学教授估计需要建筑五百到一千个大工厂，才能够全国蒸谷。这样大的基建工程，恐非十年八年不易完成，但要使全国普遍的用土法蒸谷，一经组织，一、二年内，定可观成，孰快孰慢，可以对比。至于日光问题，也有不少的解决办法；晒场则所用不多，无须考虑。大家应该知道倘用机器来热处理那么大数字的稻谷，需要消费多少钢铁五金，是可以一笔一笔算出的，我国现在40％的钢铁器材是依靠进口的，去年下半年所缺很多，现在明明暂时不必改用机器而同样的可以完成这一重大的任务，并且时间上土法要快速得多，大家似乎应该为人民而节约这笔可省的巨大消费。
    我们应该知道苏联民间也早盛行粮食热处理方法，但是直到了几个五年计划之后，机器力量大大有余，才由国家来推广机器热处理。我们还应该知道苏联在全国农业机械化时候，仍然注重原有兽力的利用。所以，我国现在推广蒸谷米，绝对应该从土法上改进，并利用所有原有的设备，不应该浪费国家仅有的钢铁五金。首先，大家思想中，不要误认土法蒸谷像以前中医中药之被视为落后不科学的废物，才能推动开来。
    一面限期大力的推广，一面调查研究全国各种热处理粮食情况，应该同时并进。倘再不放手做去，第一个五年计划已近结束，第二个五年计划亦不难轻轻放过，对人民来说是没有好处的。倘以为方向对的，希望就着手来做。
    我们决不以大锅大桶的土法为满足，不过目前为节约很巨大的设备资金和很大量的钢铁机器，并希望于最短期内各地投入生产，很快的为国家节约几十亿元一年起见，所以才不避落后之嫌，建议以不美观的土法暂作先锋。总希望同苏联一样，在几个五年计划之后，自产的钢铁机械已多，农业机械化已相当普遍，那时使蒸谷站或流动蒸谷厂相望于陇亩之间，是当然的顺理成章之事。
    推广的切实办法
    推广蒸谷米到全国，是划时代的民食改革，办起来好像是千头万绪，不可以急进的。方向既然确定，只要运用组织的力量，成功真“易于反手”。目前推广的切要办法，必须有两种组织：
    一、农民间的组织　组织农民自己来蒸谷，是最经济最合理的唯一办法。现在全国农民的全部劳动力量，集中于农业合作社，只要订出办法，稍加训练，分队分组，使各蒸其自产的稻谷，每年不要几天工夫，完全可以蒸晒完毕。通常每当收稻时候，有一个多月的连日晴天，不愁没有太阳。秋收之际，乡村间零星杂柴，俯拾即是，蒸谷用的燃料，竟可不用花钱。晒谷场地，家家原有，其他用具，亦都可通用。蒸灶尽可以泥砌，一个劳动日可砌灶两只，也可砌大一些的尺寸，泥砌亦可用几年。只要一个号召，全国农民欣然应命，因为动员农民自己来蒸，缴公粮和卖给国家，都可用蒸过的谷，这样，对于国家与农民是双方有利益的。原来农民把稻谷交给国家，必须晒到一定的规格，这笔晒工，计每翻晒稻谷一次，百斤要费人工六分钱，平均生谷以晒两次来计算，工费已大得可观。倘由农民自己来蒸谷，则不论怎样潮湿的谷，都可边割边蒸，不用先晒，等到蒸后，总晒一次即可，所节省的晒工用费，几等于全部蒸谷的一半。不论为节约费用来说，及加快生产的速度来说，组织广大的农民各自蒸其所产的谷，恐怕是最切实的推广办法。
    二、行政上的组织　行政组织是一切组织的张本。组织广大的农民来担负这样大的任务，决不是一部分业务部门所能独力担得起的，近年蒸谷米的不能推广一步，主要原因就在没有推动这项事业的组织。因为这件事业关涉的方面很广，不但与国务院所属的六、七个部都有密切的关系，并与医务科学都有关联。所以，必须集中各方面的人力，共同来负起推进的责任，首先要有一个组织。去年中国科学院为了决定进行计划，特由国务院设置科学规划委员会来规划一切。近年先进的榨油法，还由中央特设机构来推进。现在蒸谷米和其他粮食热处理的推广，要比油脂重要得多，所以，在国务院直接领导之下，成立一个热处理粮食推广委员会，来负决定计划和动员农民的职责，不要几年，肯定的能推动全国。委员会应该融合各方面的智力物力，对此确有经验的专才要加以容纳。在节约整编时期，不应增设机构，但特为搞大增产任务的组织，似不因极少的一些费用而弃莫大的利益。
    再不让人民空等了
    近年来，各地人民为了粮食的保管、供应和习惯等等关系，对于蒸谷米的需要日益迫切，尤其从学校和工地上因病休养数以千百计的青年，亦正待改吃蒸谷米以解决其营养问题。但是蒸谷地区，此米已近绝迹，人民不免由热望而感到失望，我们得到反映很多，老老实实的代为陈述。并根据实际需要，建议一些切实办法。附带两个希望：
    一、希望政府不但重视其事，并付之实际行动。行动的第一步是在组织，是在合理的中心组织，再不空言重视，第一个五年计划已到了末年，每年几十亿元可以节省的数字必须争取。
    二、希望各地报刊，不断的加以宣传，使家喻户晓，则人民很容易的起来实行。回亿三十几年前，孙中山先生曾动员上海各报，每天牺牲一版，专以提倡兵工，谓三个月必可成功。我们现在希望各报刊对于与国计民生关系密切的这一件事业，要加以重视，帮助其成功。（附图片）
