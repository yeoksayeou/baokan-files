    (I)
    Since the upsurge of China's socialist revolution in the spring of 1956, people from all walks of life and industrialists and businessmen across the country have put forward the requirement of strengthening the study of political theory in order to further strengthen self-education and self-reform. At the end of March 1956, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference issued the "Decision on Organizing Political and Theoretical Study for People from All Walks of Life and Industrialists and Businessmen" (hereinafter referred to as the "Decision"), which promoted the study work in various places. In the past year, both the study of people from all walks of life and the study of industrialists and businessmen have achieved varying degrees of success. In terms of the study of industrialists and businessmen, many regions have held short-term training classes mainly for capitalist industrialists and businessmen in accordance with the "Decision". Up to now, generally more than two sessions have been held, and the number of industrialists and businessmen participating in the study is estimated to have exceeded 50,000. Summarizing the work experience of the short-term training class is not only of positive significance for the future work of the training class, but also some of the experience is beneficial to the study of people from all walks of life.

    The study time of the short-term training class is generally three months. Since the study time is short, and capitalist industrialists and businessmen are generally participating in political theory study for the first time, the purpose of the short-term training class is mainly to conduct an enlightenment education on political theory for them, so that they can gain preliminary knowledge of the laws of social development, especially the principles of "destroying capitalism and establishing socialism", and inspire their enthusiasm and confidence in self-education and self-reform. To measure the work of the training class in the past year according to this requirement, it is basically successful. After studying in the training class, the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen have gained to varying degrees. This is mainly manifested in the following aspects:

    The majority of students have raised their political awareness and have a preliminary understanding in their minds of what is capitalism and what is socialism, and why industrialists and businessmen should accept socialist transformation. Many students reflected that before studying, their understanding of the difference between capitalism and socialism and the state's policy of peaceful transformation of capitalist industry and commerce was not clear enough. Some people said that striving for joint state-private ownership was indeed voluntary, but they did not understand the benefits of taking the socialist road. Others said that capitalists also worked hard and used their brains, so why were they said to be exploiting without labor and exploiting people? After studying, they have a preliminary understanding of the laws of social development, that labor creates the human world, that labor is glorious and exploitation is shameful, and they also have a preliminary understanding of the difference between socialism and capitalism, and why industrialists and businessmen in our country must accept socialist transformation. This promotes and increases their confidence in taking the socialist road.

    Due to the improvement of understanding, many students have changed in action. Some of them returned to the enterprise and worked actively, put forward rationalization proposals; some disclosed their technology and gave play to their strengths; some enthusiastically participated in socialist competitions and made achievements in their work, and were rated as advanced workers; some took the initiative to improve their working relationship with public representatives and employees. Public representatives and trade union leaders in many places expressed satisfaction with the achievements of industrialists and businessmen in their studies. Some specialized companies, because the industrialists and businessmen who returned from their studies had made progress in their work attitude, requested that the training class allocate more places for study. This shows that the effect of the study of some industrialists and businessmen is quite significant.

    Through study, many industrialists and businessmen have begun to develop the habit of studying, increased their interest in learning, and encouraged the enthusiasm of the majority of industrialists and businessmen to study. This is also very important.

    In the study, the progress of industrialists and businessmen is uneven. Some progress quickly, some progress slowly, and some show no progress. On some key issues, such as the issue of exploitation, the issue of working-class leadership, the issue of the superiority of socialism, the issue of whether the bourgeoisie has a dual nature after the joint operation of the entire industry, and the issue of whether the relationship between public and private cooperation is also a class relationship, there have been heated debates in training classes in various places. There were various thoughts and opinions in the debates. After the debates, some of these thoughts and opinions were resolved, some were not completely resolved, and some were not resolved at all. These debates are good and should continue in the future. Short-term training classes can only give industrialists and businessmen some preliminary political theory knowledge. We cannot and should not require the training class to solve their ideological problems at once. It should be recognized that the self-education of industrialists and businessmen is a long-term and arduous task.

    (II)
    In the teaching work of the short-term training class, various places have created some good experiences, some of which are universal. First of all, the experience of various places proves that the principle of voluntary participation and the teaching method of independent thinking and free debate determined by the Association are correct. Generally, all regions attach importance to and implement this principle and method, and have achieved good results. At the beginning, many regions did not fully understand the spirit of the above-mentioned principles, and there were deviations from voluntarism and excessively high and urgent demands, such as assigning enrollment, excessive and strict systems, and too tight arrangements for life and study. The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference issued "Several Explanations on Teaching Principles" in response to this situation. Most regions conducted inspections and corrections based on this, which eliminated the ideological concerns of the students, and the enthusiasm for learning was greatly improved. There are still some places where the above-mentioned principles have not been fully implemented and need to be further improved. At the same time, a few places have also shown another deviation of relaxing leadership and letting things go, and this phenomenon is also being corrected now.

    In the teaching process, experience has proved that linking theory with practice is an important method. To effectively carry out the teaching of "destroying capitalism and establishing socialism", it is impossible not to link it with practice. The aspects of linking with practice can include: domestic and foreign, enterprises and individuals. Realistic political and economic life is the most vivid teaching material for linking with practice. There are many ways to link theory with practice. One or two capitalist enterprises and socialist enterprises can be taken as typical examples, analyzed and compared to illustrate the profit-seeking nature of capitalism and the superiority of the socialist system. Some visits and visits can also be organized. These are the most effective teaching methods. However, the integration of theory with practice must be based on the gradual improvement of understanding, and should not be forced, and the tendency to investigate thoughts and history should be prevented.

    Criticism and self-criticism are the basic methods for people to conduct self-education and self-reform internally. According to the experience of some training classes, it is also feasible to adopt the method of criticism and self-criticism in short-term training classes on the basis of students' conscious and voluntary participation. In fact, "distinguishing right from wrong and explaining the truth" also includes the meaning of criticism and self-criticism. However, both criticism and self-criticism should be based on reasoning and convincing people, not labeling people, and even less using rude attitudes.

    To make the teaching work achieve good results, it is necessary to repeatedly explain the truth, convince people with reason, seek truth from facts, analyze specifically, avoid simplification and absolutization, and avoid mechanical copying. For example, when talking about capitalist exploitation, on the one hand, it is necessary to clarify the exploitative nature of capitalists, the class difference between capitalists and the working people, and at the same time, it is necessary to proceed from reality and make specific analysis based on specific circumstances. The situation of capitalist industrialists and businessmen in our country is complicated. Generally, they are born out of exploitation and start their businesses with exploitation, relying entirely on exploitation income; but there are also those who were first working people and then became capitalists, and there are also those who rely on partial exploitation and partial labor income. When criticizing the capitalist management system, certain good management methods that can serve socialism must be affirmed and not be completely rejected. Only in this way can people be convinced by reason and make industrialists and businessmen convinced.

    Generally speaking, to correctly implement the principle of voluntarism and the teaching method of independent thinking and free debate, it is necessary to strengthen ideological leadership, conduct specific research and comprehensive analysis on the students' ideological situation and the problems found in the study, and inspire the students' consciousness in a deep and meticulous manner, in order to improve the effect of the study.

    (III)
    At present, there are still some specific problems in the training class that need to be further studied and resolved: First, the issue of teachers. Teachers are one of the keys to determining the success or failure of the training class. The reason why the training classes in various places have achieved certain results is inseparable from the hard work of the lecturers. At present, most of the lecturers in the training class are part-time, and the responsible comrades of the Party and government and other relevant aspects in many regions serve as lectures, giving great help to the training class. According to one year's experience, larger training classes need to have some full-time lecturers in order to improve the quality of teaching and ensure the progress of teaching. For part-time lecturers, some places have ensured their teaching time by the organization, and have fixed the part-time lecturers and assigned lectures according to regulations. Some places have organized lecturer groups or teaching and research groups, and at the same time, the training class has promptly reflected the students' ideological situation to the lecturers so that the lecturers can prepare for the lectures according to the students' thoughts. This is a better experience. The Association and the local committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference should take some appropriate measures in the future to help lecturers with the difficulties in their teaching work.

    Second, regarding the issue of teaching materials, various places have made appropriate additions and deletions to the existing teaching materials during lectures; some have compiled and printed their own teaching materials. Many regions have raised some opinions on the existing teaching materials. We believe that the existing teaching materials need to be supplemented and revised, and good teaching materials compiled and printed by various regions should be introduced and exchanged with each other.

    Third, regarding the issue of study time and funding, the "Decision" originally stipulated that each session of the training class should be two to four months. Generally, it is three months in various places, which is more appropriate, and may be extended appropriately when necessary. As for when to complete the task of organizing capitalist industrialists and businessmen to participate in the study of the training class, the "Decision" originally stipulated two or three years (ie, 1956-1958), but if some regions have a large number of industrialists and businessmen who voluntarily study and cannot complete the study by the end of 1958, it can also be extended. The funding for the training class should still be borne by the specialized company in accordance with the provisions of the "Decision".

    (IV)
    The ideological transformation of industrialists and businessmen is a long-term task. After the short-term training class, some enterprises actively support, help and encourage the students who have graduated from the short-term training class in their practical work, and at the same time help them continue to conduct political theory study. By doing so, they can consolidate their learning experience and further improve their ideological level. The self-education and self-reform of capitalist industrialists and businessmen should mainly be carried out from work and business practice. Therefore, we believe that after they graduate from the short-term training class, studying political theory with public personnel or employees in enterprises and institutions will be a basic method. If there is no regular learning organization in the enterprise or industry, or there is no course suitable for their study, the relevant units should take some appropriate transitional measures. There can be various ways to give them the opportunity to continue learning as much as possible. In this regard, the specific measures and methods remain to be further studied and await the creation of experience in various places.

    (V)
    The local Party committees attach importance to the study of industrialists and businessmen. Under the unified leadership of the local committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, many regions have formed study committees and study offices. The Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association have actively participated in this work, and other relevant aspects have also given strong support. These have played a significant role in running the short-term training class well. In view of the fact that the self-education and self-reform of industrialists and businessmen is a long-term task, it is recommended that the local committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference continue to strengthen this work in the future, regularly supervise and inspect, and help solve the problems raised in the study; it is necessary to continue to strive for the leadership of the Party committee and the support and cooperation of relevant aspects. The specialized bureaus and specialized companies should also continue to encourage capitalist industrialists and businessmen to participate in the study; in addition, it is necessary to absorb the backbone members of the business community to participate in this work, because they are familiar with the situation of industrialists and businessmen and are of great help to the self-education of industrialists and businessmen. Only when the Party committee strengthens its leadership and the relevant aspects give due attention and support can this work be done well.

    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会学习委员会关于工商业者短期讲习班工作的总结报告
    （常务委员会工作报告的附件）	（一）
    自从1956年春我国社会主义革命进入高潮以来，全国各界民主人士和工商业者为了进一步加强自我教育和自我改造，提出了加强学习政治理论的要求。1956年3月底政协全国委员会发布
  “关于组织各界民主人士和工商业者进行政治学习和理论学习的决定”（下简称“决定”），推动了各地的学习工作。在过去一年中各界民主人士的学习和工商业者的学习，都有不同程度的成就。在工商业者学习方面，许多地区根据“决定”主要为资本主义工商业者举办了短期讲习班。到目前为止，一般已办到二期以上，参加学习的工商业者约计已超过五万人。总结一下短期讲习班的工作经验，不仅对于讲习班今后的工作有积极的意义，其中某些经验，对各界民主人士的学习也是有益的。
    短期讲习班的学习时间一般都是三个月。由于学习的时间较短，资本主义工商业者一般是初次参加政治理论学习，短期讲习班的目的主要是对他们进行一次政治理论的启蒙教育，使他们对于社会发展规律，特别是对于“破资本主义，立社会主义”的道理获得初步知识，启发他们自我教育和自我改造的积极性和信心。按照这一要求来衡量过去一年讲习班的工作，基本上是成功的。通过讲习班的学习以后，绝大多数的工商业者都有不同程度的收获。这主要有以下一些表现：
    大多数学员提高了政治觉悟，在思想上初步地认识了什么是资本主义和什么是社会主义，以及工商业者为什么要接受社会主义改造等道理。不少学员反映，在学习以前他们对于资本主义和社会主义的区别，国家对资本主义工商业的和平改造方针的认识是不够清楚的。有的人说，争取公私合营的确是出于自愿的，但是走社会主义道路究竟有什么好处，却不明白。又有人说，资本家也是辛辛苦苦地动脑筋，为什么说他们是不劳而获，是剥削，实在想不通。通过了学习，他们初步认识到社会发展规律、劳动创造人类世界、劳动光荣和剥削可耻的道理，也初步认识了社会主义和资本主义的区别，以及我国工商业者为什么必须接受社会主义改造。这就促进和提高他们走社会主义道路的信心。
    由于认识的提高，不少学员在行动上有所改变。他们有的回到企业后工作积极，提合理化建议；有的公开了技术，发挥自己的所长；有的热烈参加社会主义竞赛，在工作中做出了成绩，被评为先进工作者；有的主动去改进同公方代表和职工的共事关系。不少地方的公方代表和工会负责人对工商业者学习的成绩表示满意。有的专业公司因工商业者学习回来，在工作态度上有了进步，要求讲习班多分配学习的名额。这说明一部分工商业者学习的效果是相当显著的。
    通过学习，不少工商业者开始养成了学习的习惯，提高了对学习的兴趣，并且鼓舞了广大工商业者学习的积极性。这也是很重要的。
    在学习中，工商业者的进步是不平衡的，有的进步快，有的进步慢，也有看不出什么进步的。在一些关键性的问题上，例如关于剥削问题，工人阶级领导问题，社会主义优越性问题，全行业合营以后资产阶级有没有两面性的问题，公私共事关系是不是同时又是阶级关系问题等等，各地讲习班都有过热烈的争论。在争论中有各种不同的思想和意见，经过争论以后，这些思想和意见有的解决了，有的没有完全解决，有的根本没有解决，这些争论是好的，今后还应该继续进行。短期讲习班只能给工商业者一些初步政治理论知识，我们不可能也不应该要求讲习班一下子解决他们的思想问题。应该认识：工商业者的自我教育是一个长期的艰苦的工作。	（二）
    在短期讲习班的教学工作中，各地都创造了一些好的经验，其中有些经验是带有普遍性的。首先，各地的经验证明本会所决定的参加学习必须根据自愿原则以及独立思考、自由辩论的教学方法是正确的。各地一般都重视并执行了这一原则和方法，因而取得了良好的效果。在开始的时候，也有不少地区对上述原则的精神理解不足，曾经出现违反自愿和要求过高过急的偏向，例如指派入学，制度过多过严，生活、学习安排过于紧张等等。政协全国委员会针对这种情况发出“有关教学方针的几点说明”，大多数地区据此进行了检查和纠正，解除了学员的思想顾虑，学习情绪也大为提高；还有若干地方对上述原则贯彻不够，需要继续改进。同时也有少数地方又出现了放松领导、放任自流的另一偏向，这种现象现在也在改正中。
    在教学过程中，经验证明，理论联系实际是一个重要方法。要有效地进行“破资本主义，立社会主义”的教学，不联系实际是不可能的。联系实际的方面可以包括：国内、国外，企业、个人。现实的政治生活和经济生活是最生动的联系实际的教材。联系实际的方法是多种多样的，可以取一、二个资本主义企业和社会主义企业为典型，加以解剖和对比，说明资本主义唯利是图的本质和社会主义制度的优越性，也可以组织一些参观访问等等，这些都是最有效的教学方法。但是理论联系实际，必须建立在认识逐步提高的基础上，不要勉强，更应该防止查思想、查历史的偏向。
    批评和自我批评是人民内部进行自我教育和自我改造的基本方法。根据一部分讲习班的经验，在学员自觉自愿的基础上，在短期讲习班采用批评和自我批评的方法也是可行的。事实上，“辨明是非，讲清道理”也就包括有批评和自我批评的意义。但是无论是批评和自我批评都应该以理服人，不扣帽子，更不要用粗暴态度。
    要使教学工作收到良好效果，必须反复讲清道理，以理服人，实事求是，具体分析，不要简单化、绝对化，不要生搬硬套。例如讲到资本主义的剥削的时候，一方面要阐明资本家的剥削本质，资本家和劳动人民的阶级区别，同时还必须从实际出发，根据具体情况作具体分析。我国资本主义工商业者的情况是复杂的，一般是剥削出身，剥削起家，完全靠剥削收入；但是也有先是劳动人民而后变成资本家的，也有部分剥削、部分依靠劳动收入的。在批判资本主义经营管理制度的时候，对于某些好的经营管理方法，可以为社会主义服务的必须加以肯定，不可以一笔抹煞。这样才能以理服人，使工商业者口服心服。
    总的说来，要正确地贯彻自愿原则和独立思考、自由辩论的教学方法，必须加强思想领导，对学员的思想情况和在学习中发现的问题作具体研究和全面分析，深入细致地启发学员的自觉，才能提高学习的效果。	（三）
    目前，在讲习班中还存在一些具体问题，需要继续研究解决：第一，关于师资问题，师资是决定讲习班办得好坏的关键之一。各地讲习班之所以取得一定成绩是和讲师们的辛勤努力分不开的。讲习班讲师目前多为兼职，不少地区的党政和其他有关方面的负责同志担任讲课，给予了讲习班以很大的帮助。根据一年的经验，较大的讲习班，需要有一部分专职讲师，才能提高教学质量，保证教学进度。对兼职讲师，有的地方由组织上保证了他们的教学时间，并且把兼职讲师固定起来，按章分工讲课。有的地方组织了讲师团或者教研组，同时由讲习班及时向讲师反映学员的思想情况，以便讲师针对学员的思想，作好讲课工作，这是较好的经验。我会和政协地方委员会今后对于讲师在教学工作上的困难还应该采取一些适当的办法，加以帮助。
    第二，关于教材问题，各地对于现有的教材，有的在讲授的时候作了适当的增减；有的自行编印了教材。不少地区对现有的教材提出了一些意见，我们认为对于现有教材需要加以补充、修改，并且把各地编印的好的教材互相介绍和交流。
    第三，关于学习时间和经费问题，“决定”原定讲习班每期为二至四个月。各地一般是三个月，这是比较适当的，必要时，不妨酌为延长。至于什么时候完成组织资本主义工商业者参加讲习班学习的任务，“决定”中原规定为二、三年（即1956—1958年），但是如果有的地区自愿学习的工商业者人数较多，到1958年底还不能学习完毕，也可以延长。讲习班的经费，仍应根据“决定”的规定，统一由专业公司负担。	（四）
    工商业者的思想改造是一个长期性的工作，短期讲习班学习以后，有些企业，对短期讲习班已经结业的学员，在实际工作中积极给以支持、帮助和鼓励，同时帮助他们继续进行政治理论学习，这样做，便能巩固他们的学习心得，进一步提高他们的思想水平。资本主义工商业者自我教育和自我改造，主要要从工作和业务实践中进行，因此，我们认为，他们在短期讲习班结业以后，在企业和机关中同公方人员或者职工一起学习政治理论，将是一个基本的方式。如果在企业或行业中还没有经常性的学习组织，或者还没有适合他们学习的课程，有关单位应该采取一些适当的过渡措施，方式可以多种多样，尽可能使他们有继续学习的机会。在这方面，具体的措施和办法还有待于继续研究，有待于各地创造经验。	（五）
    当地党委对工商业者的学习是重视的，许多地区在政协地方委员会的统一领导下，组成学习委员会和学习办公室，工商业联合会、民主建国会都积极参加了这一工作，其他有关方面也给予了有力的支持，这些对于办好短期讲习班起了重大的作用。鉴于工商业者的自我教育和自我改造是一个长期性的工作，建议政协地方委员会今后继续加强这方面的工作，定期督促检查，帮助解决学习中所提出的问题；要继续争取党委领导和有关方面的支持和配合，专业局和专业公司也应当继续鼓励资本主义工商业者参加学习；此外，要吸收工商界骨干分子参加这方面的工作，因为他们熟悉工商业者的情况，对工商业者进行自我教育有很大帮助。只有党委加强领导和有关方面予以应有的重视和支持，才能做好这一工作。
