　　A Production Increase and Economy Team
　　——On the Waste Recycling Vendors of Fuzhou City
　　You Chuanxin
    Fuzhou City has a group of mobile vendors – waste recycling vendors. They travel the streets and villages, covering every corner to collect waste copper and scrap iron, rags and waste cotton, used books and waste paper, pig bristles, chicken and duck feathers, hair, waste rubber, broken glass, pig and cattle bones, and other discarded materials. They use flexible and diverse methods of purchasing, such as cash purchases, exchanging goods, and so on. These vendors, relying on a carrying pole, two baskets, and three to five yuan, collect these scattered and fragmented waste products bit by bit, turning worthless waste into useful items, creating wealth for the country, and increasing the income of the people. In this way, the 638 waste recycling vendors in Fuzhou City can accumulate about 90,000 yuan of wealth for the country each month.
    How do they turn waste into wealth? When asked about this, almost every waste recycling vendor can introduce a set of processing methods for sorting and organizing. Take the seemingly insignificant chicken and duck feathers, for example. They must be sorted and selected one by one, first separating the valuable duck feathers (which can be exported) from the chicken feathers to prevent the chicken feathers from causing insect infestation when mixed with duck feathers. After the chicken feathers are separated, the high-value tail feathers are picked out to be sold to handicraftsmen to make feather dusters, and the remaining feathers are used as fertilizer. Usually, we think that rags are only used as raw materials for papermaking. In fact, once rags are in their hands, they must be sorted. Larger pieces of scrap cloth are picked out, washed clean, and sold to machine factories to wipe machines. Lower-quality pieces are sold to handicraftsmen to line cloth or make shoe soles. Long strips of scrap cloth are used to make mops, and smaller pieces are used to weave straw sandals. The scraps that cannot be used are sent to paper mills or cotton textile factories as raw materials. Old sacks and hemp ropes are first cut into complete pieces to be used as packaging materials, and broken, unusable pieces are crushed to be used as hemp fibers for construction. Parts picked out from piles of scrap copper and iron can often be assembled into complete items and meet the needs of factories that lack parts.
    In addition to actively purchasing waste products from residents and organizations, waste recycling vendors also travel to remote mountains and wilderness areas to discover various discarded waste products. The large number of soil cannon heads submerged in the river in Shaxian County were rediscovered in this way. Last year, after the Minhou County Fangkou automobile maintenance plant moved away, they also washed dozens of loads of medicinal lead from the soil on the site.
    Waste recycling vendors also make a certain contribution to the protection of historical relics. They often find ancient books, paintings, coins, ceramic antiques, and other items of historical value among the waste products, rescuing them from the trash. The Palace Museum in Beijing, the Provincial Museum, and the library have all been their customers. Not long ago, the Provincial Library bought a Song Dynasty edition of "Fang Yu Sheng Lan."
    At the end of October last year, the waste recycling vendors in Fuzhou City, on the basis of voluntary mutual benefit, organized five cooperative stores in different districts. The waste recycling vendors invested all their funds as shares, and the cooperative stores issued each person a purchasing fund of five yuan, adopting the method of "separate purchases, joint sales, and each responsible for profits and losses." The old goods and waste products purchased by the vendors are uniformly purchased by the cooperative stores at an estimated price. The difference between the vendor's purchase price and the cooperative store's purchase price, after deducting taxes and enterprise collective expenses, is the vendor's own salary (if the vendor believes that the cooperative store's purchase price is too low, they can sell the goods themselves). After being organized, the waste recycling vendors can avoid being exploited by middlemen and do not have to worry about a lack of funds. Therefore, their operating income has increased compared to before being organized. Their enthusiasm for business has greatly increased compared to the past, and they have become a powerful team for increasing production and practicing economy.

　　一支增产节约的队伍
　　——记福州市的废品收买担
　　尤传馨
    福州市有这样一批流动小贩——收买担，他们串街串乡走遍各个角落收购废铜烂铁、破布废棉、旧书废纸、猪毛鸡鸭毛、头发、废胶、破玻璃、猪牛杂骨等等为人们废弃的物资。他们收购的方式灵活多样，例如以现款收购，以物交换等等。这些收买担靠着一条扁挑二个篓筐和三五块钱，就把这些分散零星的废品一点一滴地收集起来，把废旧不值钱的东西变为有用的东西，为国家创造了许多财富，也增加了人民群众的收入。这样，福州市的六百三十八个收买担，每个月就能为国家积累九万元左右的财富。
    他们怎样把废品变为财富呢？提起这个问题，几乎每个收买担都能介绍出一套如何分类整理的加工办法。就以人们认为微不足道的鸡鸭毛来说，他们要一根一根地加以分类挑选，先把价值大，可以出口的鸭毛与鸡毛分开，避免鸡毛混在鸭毛中发生虫蛀；鸡毛分出后，还要将鸡毛中价值高的鸡尾毛挑选出来，卖给手工业者作鸡毛拂，剩下的才作为肥料。通常我们总以为破布只是造纸原料，事实上，破布一到他们手里，还要经过挑选，把较大块的碎布挑出洗净后卖给机器厂擦机器，较次的卖给手工业者褙坯布、做鞋底，长条碎布做拖把，再碎的编草鞋，实在无法利用的碎布才送进造纸厂或棉纺织厂作原料。旧的麻袋、麻索，先把完整的裁剪下来做包装材料，破烂不能利用的捣碎作为建筑用的麻筋。从破铜、烂铁堆里挑选出的零件，往往就能装配出成件的东西和满足工厂缺少零件的需求。
    收买担除向居民和团体积极收买废品，还踏遍荒山僻野到处去发掘各种被弃掷的废品。沙县沉在江中的大量土炮头就是这样重见天日的；去年闽侯县坊口汽车保养场搬走后，他们也从场地泥土中淘洗出几十担药水铅。
    收买担对保护历史文物也有一定贡献。他们在废品当中时常发现古书、古画、钱币、陶瓷古董，从废品当中把这些有历史价值的文物挽救出来。北京故宫博物院、省博物馆、图书馆都曾作过他们的顾客，不久以前省图书馆还买了一部宋版的“方舆胜览”。
    去年10月底，福州市的收买担，在自愿互利的基础上分区组织了五个合作商店。收买担把资金全部入股，由合作商店发给每人购货基金五元，采取“分购联销各负盈亏”的方式。收买担购到的旧货废品，统一由合作商店估价收进。收买担的购进价与合作商店的收进价之间的差价，扣除税款和企业集体费用外，即为收买担本人的工资（收买担如认为合作商店收购价偏低，可以自销）。经过组织后，收买担出售废品可免受中间商的盘剥，也不愁没有资金。因此，经营收入较未组织时都有增加。他们的经营积极性比过去大大提高，已经成为一支增产节约的有力的队伍。
