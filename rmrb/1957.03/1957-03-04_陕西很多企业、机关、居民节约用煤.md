Many industrial and transportation departments, government offices, organizations, schools, and residents in the Shaanxi area are paying attention to conserving coal for production and daily life, and have achieved significant results.

    The employees of the Locomotive and Rolling Stock Section of the Sixth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways have been carrying out a coal conservation campaign since the fourth quarter of last year, and have widely promoted advanced experience in coal conservation. Before locomotives leave the depot, they make full preparations before departure and adjust the fire bed according to the climate, wind direction, and traction weight. According to statistics, they have saved 197 tons of coal to date. The employees of the Xi'an Locomotive Depot saved 208 tons of coal in fifteen days by overhauling locomotives and promoting advanced experience. Kiln workers in brick and tile factories in the Shaanxi area are also paying attention to conserving coal. For example, the kiln workers at the Baqiao Brick and Tile Factory use waste sawdust to replace part of the coal for firing kilns, saving more than 400 tons of coal in ten months.

    Many units also attach importance to conserving coal for heating, boiling water, and cooking. The workers at the tea stoves of the Shaanxi No. 2 Cotton Factory launched a competition not to claim coal. They squeezed out spare time from work to find oil yarn, wood shavings, branches, leaves, and other materials that could be used as fuel. As a result, the workers at the four tea stoves have not claimed coal for several consecutive months, saving a total of more than 70 tons of coal. The workers at the heating stoves of the Shaanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative actively tried to adopt the method of adding water to the coal, adding it slowly and lightly, and burning it thoroughly with minimal leakage. While ensuring that the heating temperature did not decrease, they could save 650 jin of coal every day. Many residents have also adopted methods such as changing large stoves to small stoves to conserve coal.

    陕西很多企业、机关、居民节约用煤
    本报讯  陕西地区很多工业交通运输部门和机关、团体、学校以及居民，都注意节约生产和生活用煤，并取得显著成绩。
    铁道部第六工程局机车车辆段的职工，从去年第四季度起开展了节约用煤竞赛，普遍地推行了节约用煤的先进经验。他们在机车出库前，充分做好发车前的准备工作，并根据气候、风向、牵引重量调整火床。据统计，到现在已节省燃煤一百九十七吨。西安机务段的职工，经过检修机车和推广先进经验，十五天就节约燃煤二百零八吨。陕西地区的砖瓦厂的烧窑工人也注意节约用煤，如坝桥砖瓦厂的烧窑工人，利用废锯末代替一部分煤烧窑，十个月以内就节约了四百多吨煤炭。
    很多单位还重视了节约取暖和烧水、烧饭用煤。陕棉二厂烧茶炉的工人开展了不领煤竞赛，在工作中挤出空余时间到各处寻找可作燃料的油纱头、木屑、树枝、树叶等，因此，四个烧茶炉的工人，已经连续几个月不领煤了，共节约了七十多吨煤。陕西省供销合作社烧暖气炉的工人积极设法采用了煤内加水，慢添轻掏，烧透少漏的办法，在保证暖气温度不降低的情况下，每天可以节省六百五十斤煤。不少居民也采取把大炉改成小炉等办法来节约用煤。
