Xinhua News Agency, March 7th dispatch from Tel Aviv: An Israeli army spokesman announced on the 6th that Israeli troops began transferring the Gaza Strip to the United Nations Emergency Force at 19:00 on the 6th. He said the transfer would be completed within 24 hours.

The spokesman also said that Sharm el-Sheikh (the Aqaba Gulf area) would be handed over to the United Nations Emergency Force on March 8.

According to press reports, Israeli troops began shipping equipment and supplies out of the Gaza and Aqaba Gulf areas on the morning of the 6th. Truckloads of goods were transported out of Gaza in torrential rain. The border area has been closed since the weekend, barring journalists from entering. At the port of Aqaba Gulf, Israeli aircraft and ships have also begun loading equipment.

An United Nations official in Cairo said earlier that United Nations Emergency Force Commander Burns had prepared a plan for how the United Nations Emergency Force would deploy in the areas vacated by Israeli troops.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 7th dispatch: Gaza City news: The last batch of Israeli aggressor troops occupying the Gaza Strip withdrew this morning. The United Nations Emergency Force has taken over the entire five-mile-wide, twenty-five-mile-long strip of land occupied by the Israeli military for more than four months.

The 2,600-strong United Nations Emergency Force entered Gaza City, the capital of the Gaza Strip, last night in torrential rain. Fearing demonstrations by Gaza residents, the Israeli aggressor troops arranged their retreat in the darkness and imposed a curfew on Gaza City residents. However, when the vanguard of the United Nations Emergency Force entered, hundreds of people still ran from their homes into the streets, shouting slogans such as "Long live Gamal Abdel Nasser!" "Down with Israel!" and shouting angrily at the retreating aggressors: "Get out!"

At the same time, the withdrawal of Israeli aggressor troops from Sharm el-Sheikh on the west coast of the Gulf of Aqaba is also underway. According to the Israeli side, they will have completely withdrawn by the afternoon of March 8.

Xinhua News Agency, March 7th dispatch from the Israeli-controlled area of Jerusalem: The Israeli parliament passed a vote of confidence in the government on the 6th regarding the government's decision to withdraw from the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba.

Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion said: "We believe that after the withdrawal, the freedom and innocent passage of Israeli and other countries' ships will be fully maintained. Israel will consider any interference by armed forces with ships flying the Israeli flag and freely and innocently passing through the Gulf of Aqaba as an act of aggression. Therefore, the inherent right of self-defense can be exercised in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter."

Regarding the Gaza Strip, he said, "Our understanding is that only the United Nations Emergency Force can enjoy military and civil control, and the United Nations' responsibility in administrative matters will remain until a peaceful settlement is achieved."

Ben-Gurion also said: If the informal promises made by the United States and other countries to Israel are not fulfilled, there will be no peace in this region. It is pointed out that this refers to the negotiations Israel conducted with the United States before announcing its withdrawal.

### 以色列侵略军滚出加沙地带  以总理要美国履行对以色列有条件撤军的诺言

    以色列侵略军滚出加沙地带
    以总理要美国履行对以色列有条件撤军的诺言
    据新华社7日讯　特拉维夫消息：以色列陆军发言人6日宣布，以色列军队在6日夜间十九时开始把加沙地带移交给联合国紧急部队。他说，移交工作将在二十四小时内完成。
    这个发言人还说，沙姆沙伊赫（亚喀巴湾地区）将在3月8日移交给联合国紧急部队。
    据报界消息，以色列军队在6日清晨开始从加沙和亚喀巴湾地区运出装备和供应品。成车的货物在倾盆大雨中被运出加沙，这一带的边境从上周周末以来就被封闭，不准记者入内。在亚喀巴湾港口，以色列的飞机和船只也已经开始在载运装备。
    开罗的一位联合国人士早些时候说，联合国紧急部队司令伯恩斯已经准备好了联合国紧急部队如何在以色列部队撤退的地区布防的计划。
    新华社开罗7日电　加沙城消息：强占加沙地区的最后一批以色列侵略军已经在今天清晨撤走。联合国紧急部队全部接管了这块被以色列军盘踞了四个多月的宽五英里、长二十五英里的狭长地带。
    联合国紧急部队两千六百名是在昨晚在滂沱大雨中开进加沙地区的首府加沙城的。以色列侵略军害怕加沙居民举行示威，他们特别安排在黑夜中撤退，并且还对加沙城居民实行宵禁。但是当联合国紧急部队先头部队开进时，仍然有几百人从家里跑到街上来，高呼“阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔万岁！”“打倒以色列！”等口号，并且对着撤退的侵略者怒喊：“滚出去！”
    同时，以色列侵略军从亚喀巴湾西岸沙姆沙伊赫的撤退也在进行中。据以色列方面表示，他们将在3月8日下午全部撤出。
    据新华社7日讯　耶路撒冷以色列区消息：以色列议会6日就政府关于从加沙地带和亚喀巴湾撤军的决定通过了对政府的信任案。
    以色列总理本—古里安说：“我们相信在撤退以后，以色列和其他国家船只自由和无害通航将得到充分的维护。以色列将认为武装部队对悬挂以色列国旗、自由无害通过亚喀巴湾的船只进行的任何干涉都是一种进攻。由此可以根据联合国宪章第五十一条行使固有的自卫权利。”
    关于加沙地区，他说，“我们的了解是，只有联合国紧急部队可以享有军事和民政控制权，同时在和平解决实现以前，联合国在管理方面的责任将保持下去。”
    本—古里安还说：如果美国和其他国家对以色列作出的非正式诺言没有被履行，那末这个地区就不会有和平。据指出，这是指以色列在宣布撤军以前同美国进行的谈判。
