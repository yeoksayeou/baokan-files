    Behind the “Strange Case”
    Yao Wenyuan
    A news report in the February 6th "Wenhui Bao" revealed the truth behind the so-called "New York Strange Case." For sixteen years, small bombs had been thrown in public places in New York, with a total of thirty-one explosions. The New York City Police Department dispatched 20,000 police officers and offered a reward of $25,000 to arrest this "mad bomber." On January 23rd of this year, the police department announced that the case had been "solved." The bomber turned out to be a 53-year-old partially disabled old worker. In 1931, while working for the Edison Company, he was injured in the course of his work and could not continue to labor, and the company refused to pay him compensation. He hated this society and was determined to throw bombs at it, but without intending to hurt anyone. He vowed to keep throwing bombs until he was arrested or died.
    It is worth noting that this old worker, Metesky, was a devout and kind Catholic. The signature on his bombs was not a strike or struggle, much less communism, but F.P. – Fair Play, the "fair play" in Lu Xun's famous essay "On 'Fair Play' Should Be Delayed," which is the so-called "fairness" or "equal opportunity" in bourgeois democracy.
    This tragedy thoroughly exposes the hypocrisy of the so-called "democracy" and "freedom" so eloquently proclaimed by bourgeois politicians. But I have more feelings.
    This legendary figure who hated capitalist society was not a "red element," but a Catholic who believed in God and often went to church for Mass. In the United States, not only are those who believe in communism persecuted, not only are those who demand true democracy and freedom persecuted, but as long as the working people demand to live, they will be cruelly oppressed. This proves that in the struggle for bread, different beliefs are a secondary issue, because when capitalists oppress workers, they do not oppress them any less because you believe in God.
    However, a person who believes in God actually took up a bomb. This further proves that God in Metesky’s heart could no longer satisfy his desire for revenge. He understood that to carry out a struggle, he must rely on his own strength.
    However, he merely took up the bomb as an individual. Taking the road of individual revenge cannot shake any cornerstone of this dark system. He used "Fair Play" as a mark, but "Fair Play" is an impossible illusion in imperialist countries. His illusion was completely shattered. Capitalists have always only demanded "Fair Play" from the working people, but as for themselves, they will use all kinds of cunning and insidious means. Believing in "Fair Play" cannot achieve self-liberation...
    Isn't that so? He used "Fair Play" methods, and as a result, he was arrested while on the verge of death from lung disease. This is a deeper tragedy…
    Buddhists say that a Buddha's eye can see the universe in a grain of sand. I do not have this kind of "Buddha's eye," but if we take this event as a grain of sand, I think we can also glimpse the "world" of American society. We can see how dark American society has become, and we can also see that some workers, influenced by capitalist ideology, still take the road of "Fair Play" when they resist. But I think this is only a temporary situation.
    This incident has been frantically sensationalized and clamored about by American journalists as a "strange case." They will surely use the writing style of detective novels to conceal the truth, so that people only see it as a "curiosity." This kind old worker may be portrayed as a "monster," like the protagonist of "Midnight Song." But for us, this is solid proof: it proves that bourgeois "freedom of the press" is just a colorful coat to cover up crimes, and it proves that in the capitalist countries, those full pages of "strange cases," "scandals," and "anecdotes" hide countless bloody accusations!

### 在“奇案”背后

    在“奇案”背后
    姚文元
    2月6日的“文汇报”上有一则通讯，报道了所谓“纽约奇案”的真相。十六年来，纽约的公共场所一直有人掷小型的炸弹，一共爆炸过三十一颗。纽约市警察局曾出动了两万名警察，悬赏二万五千美元，要逮捕这个“疯狂爆炸者”。本年1月23日，警察局宣布这个案子已经“水落石出”了，投炸弹的原来是一个五十三岁的半残废的老工人。1931年当他在艾狄逊公司工作期间，在工作中受伤，不能继续劳动，而公司拒绝付给他休养金。他仇恨这个社会，决心要向它投掷炸弹，但不准备伤人。他发誓要投掷炸弹到被捕或死去才停止。
    值得注意的是，这位老工人麦特斯基是一个虔诚的、善良的天主教徒。他在炸弹上的签名不是什么罢工或斗争，更不是共产主义，而是F．P．——Fair Play，即鲁迅名文“论‘费厄泼赖’应该缓行”中的“费厄泼赖”，就是资产阶级民主中所谓“公平”或“机会均等”。
    这个悲剧彻底揭穿了资产阶级政治家所滔滔不绝地宣扬的所谓“民主”“自由”的虚伪性。但我还有更多的感触。
    这个仇恨资本主义社会的传奇性的人物并不是“赤色分子”，而是一个相信上帝、经常到教堂去做弥撒的天主教徒。在美国，受迫害的不但是相信共产主义的人，不但是要求真正民主自由的人，只要要求活下去的劳动人民，就会受到残酷的压迫。这证明了在为争取面包的斗争中，信仰不同是次要的问题，因为资本家在压迫工人的时候，并不因为你相信上帝就少压迫一些的。
    然而相信上帝的人竟拿起了炸弹。这又证明了上帝在麦特斯基心上已经不能满足自己复仇的要求了。他懂得了要进行斗争必须依靠自己的力量。
    然而他又仅仅个人拿起了炸弹。走个人复仇的道路，是不能动摇这个黑暗的制度的任何一块基石的。他用“费厄泼赖”作标记，然而“费厄泼赖”在帝国主义国家里是不可能实现的幻想。他的幻想是完全落空了。资本家从来只是向劳动人民要求“费厄泼赖”，至于他们自己，则一切奸诈阴险的手段都会使出来的。迷信“费厄泼赖”，是不能求得自身解放的……
    不是吗？他用了“费厄泼赖”式的方法，结果还是在肺病垂危时被捕了。这是一个更深刻的悲剧……
    佛家说，佛眼能够从一粒沙中见大千世界。我并没有这种“佛眼”，但如果把这件事作为一粒沙的话，我以为也可以窥见美国社会的“世界”的。我们窥见了美国的社会黑暗到了何种程度，我们也可以窥见有的工人受了资本主义思想的侵蚀，在反抗时也还是走“费厄泼赖”的道路。但我想，这也只是暂时的情形。
    这件事，美国的新闻记者们又当作“奇案”在疯狂地渲染和叫嚣了。他们必将用侦探小说的笔法将真相掩去，使人民只当作“奇闻”看。这位善良的老工人，也许会同“夜半歌声”的主角一样被说成为“妖怪”。可是对于我们，这却是一个铁证：它证明资产阶级的“新闻自由”只是一件掩盖罪恶的彩衣，它证明在资本主义国家那些整版整版的“奇案”“艳事”“趣闻”中，隐藏着多少血淋淋的控诉！
