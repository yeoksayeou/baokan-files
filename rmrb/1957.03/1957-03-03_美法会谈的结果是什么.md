An article published in the American "Foreign Affairs Quarterly" in January of this year described the US-UK-France alliance relationship from the US perspective as follows: "The US government believes that the interests of the US, Britain, and France are consistent in dealing with the communist world, but the policies of Britain and France in North Africa, the Middle East, and Asia are not consistent with the interests of the United States. The United States also feels that the alliance can only play a role in matters that the United States considers important, and not in matters that Britain and France consider important." Whether judging by past or present facts, this statement truly reveals the true intentions of the United States in dealing with its alliance relationship with Britain and France.

The recent three-day US-France talks in Washington and their results are a true performance of the United States treating its allies according to the above formula.

In the so-called US-France alliance relationship, there is actually no "unchanging" friendship. On the contrary, it is full of contradictions arising from conflicting interests. In the event of France, Britain, and Israel launching a war of aggression against Egypt last year, the conflict of interest between the US and France was once again publicly exposed, and the rift in the US-France relationship widened. The French Prime Minister Mollet and Foreign Minister Pineau, who provoked the aggression against Egypt, said many hurtful things about the US attitude in the war of aggression against Egypt. However, despite being hurt, Mollet and his ilk were still obsessively dreaming about US "friendship." After the failure of the aggression against Egypt, Mollet repeatedly publicly requested a meeting with the US President to "improve" US-France relations. However, this "unchanging" friendship of the French government leaders did not get an enthusiastic response from the other side; the White House was unwilling to receive Mollet early and dragged it out until after the "Eisenhower Doctrine" was launched before issuing an invitation. And the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" is yet another knife that the US inserted into the rift in US-France and US-UK relations; its purpose is to take advantage of the weakening of Britain and France in the Middle East to completely squeeze them out of this region and have the United States act as the overlord and policeman of the Middle East. This is the posture that the US had pre-arranged for Mollet's visit to the US, and it is also an "unchanging" answer that Eisenhower had long prepared for the "unchanging" friendship with the French government leader.

The biggest wound in US-France relations at present is on the Middle East issue, so the central issue discussed in the US-France talks was also the Middle East issue. Before going to the US, Mollet declared that he would "bring nothing and make no demands." In fact, he went to Washington with a major purpose, which was to seek a so-called "common long-term Middle East policy" between the US and France. The French Prime Minister publicly stated this when he was in Washington, but the result was a complete failure. In the joint statement of Eisenhower and Mollet, which was full of words of "friendship," only this empty phrase was said about the Middle East issue: They (i.e., Eisenhower and Mollet) jointly believed that "the solution to the Middle East issue can be achieved by peaceful means that comply with the principles of justice and international law." This kind of high-sounding but practically meaningless empty talk is obviously not the kind of "common long-term Middle East policy" that Mollet was seeking. On the contrary, it reflects that the result of the US-France talks did not change the US determination to promote its new colonialist plan of squeezing out Britain and France and implementing "going it alone" in the Middle East. The joint statement did not even mention the "Eisenhower Doctrine," which proves how deeply this "doctrine" pricked the "unchanging" friendship between the US and France.

Literally, the heads of the US and France at least showed a consistent attitude on the Suez Canal issue. In the joint statement, "they reaffirmed their adherence" to the six principles for resolving the Suez Canal issue adopted by the UN Security Council last October, and particularly emphasized the proposals for "unimpeded navigation of the canal without discrimination" and "the management of the canal being insulated from the politics of any country." It is worth noting here that they deliberately ignored the most important point of the six principles, which is to recognize Egypt's unshakable sovereignty over the canal. But the problem is that behind this superficial consistency between the US and France, each is making different calculations. Since the canal was nationalized by Egypt, the US has been carrying out a plan to establish a consortium of American oil and shipping companies to operate the canal; recently retired American General Van Fleet even went to Egypt to conduct activities, wanting to build an oil pipeline along the canal to replace the canal. And even after the failure of the aggression against Egypt, France has never given up the plan to "establish an international system for managing the canal," and even wants to find a "common proposition" of the US, Britain, and France on this issue. It seems that even on this issue, there are still differences between the US and France between "separate" plunder and "joint" plunder. But whether it is the US plan or the French plan, their common point is to disregard Egypt's firm will to safeguard its sovereignty, and this is where they are destined to suffer.

The US-France talks failed to bridge their rifts on the Middle East issue, and they also had different intentions on the issues of "European unification" and the so-called "Euro-African unification" that Mollet was keen on. Mollet was not only intoxicated with the tunes of "European unification" and "Euro-African unification" on the way from Paris to Washington, but also emphasized the "importance and speed" of development in these areas during the talks with Eisenhower at the White House. The reason why Mollet trumpeted these was because he felt that "only through unification can Europe rediscover true independence," and only then can there be a "new relationship" with the United States, and only then can the days when "there are three or four important groups in the world instead of just two" arrive. In other words, this is the path of the "non-aligned third world force" that Mollet is pursuing. Of course, it cannot be said that Mollet's path is not a path for France. The problem is that if he treats the recent agreements reached by the six Western European countries on the common market and the atomic energy joint venture as his own achievements and uses them as the capital of his "non-aligned third world force," then it cannot but be a regrettable mistake. Because the country that will play a major role in this "unified" Europe is probably not Mollet's socialist France, but Adenauer's West Germany. And Adenauer's close relationship with the United States is well known. Mollet's triumph is perhaps premature.

According to the content of the joint statement issued after the talks, Eisenhower only treated Mollet's one-sided enthusiasm on the issue of "European unification" and "Euro-African unification" with coldness. Eisenhower only expressed "personal concern" about the so-called "treaty on European unification" (note: only "personal" concern). Regarding the so-called "decision to link overseas territories with the European common market," he did not even express any attitude at all.

Mollet's so-called "Euro-African unification," in his own words, is: "mobilizing the industrial strength of the entire Europe to provide Africa with the social progress and technical equipment it needs." In reality, France is attempting to use the capital of mainly West Germany to develop and plunder its African territories, as well as Tunisia, Morocco, and other recently independent African countries under its control. The main reason why France is adopting the method of "Euro-African unification" instead of seeking US capital and assistance is that France has suffered enough from the US squeezing it out in Indochina and the Middle East. In the words of French Foreign Minister Pineau, France "does not need to have things like Indochina again." Therefore, the so-called "Euro-African unification" actually contains a plan to resist US infiltration into France's African territories.

However, can the US forces that have already succeeded in Indochina and the Middle East stop at Africa just because France has put up the banner of "Euro-African unification" in Africa? Especially with the discovery of large deposits of minerals including oil, uranium, copper, iron, manganese, and coal in the Sahara region, can the insatiable US monopoly capital remain indifferent? People can see that just as France is actively engaging in "Euro-African unification" and hurriedly establishing a "Sahara Region Joint Organization" to develop this region, the US is also advancing towards Africa with great fanfare. The Francis Bolton mission of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee and the chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Green, successively published reports on inspecting Africa last August and this February. Both reports emphasized the "great significance of Africa to the United States." Bolton's report openly stated that "developing Africa" is a responsibility that the United States "cannot escape," while Green's report more explicitly pointed out that the difficulty of American private investment in Tunisia is "because the economic relations between France and its former protectorate are still very close." Therefore, Green suggested: "Assisting Moroccans through long-term loans or encouraging American private capital investment" and advocating "making provisions for Tunisia's demands" in the foreign aid plan. It seems that the US large-scale infiltration into Africa is already imminent and cannot be stopped by Mollet's "Euro-African unification." In this situation, US Vice President Nixon's announcement that he would visit many African countries, including Tunisia and Morocco, taking advantage of his participation in the independence ceremony of Ghana (i.e., the Gold Coast), cannot but be seen as a road-opening action for the infiltration of American capital into Africa.

Therefore, Mollet's "Euro-African unification" plan will actually foreshadow a fierce battle between the US and France in Africa.

Of course, it cannot be said that Mollet gained nothing in the United States. At least, he and Eisenhower reached a consistent "view" on the issue of the "free world" "maintaining troops with conventional armaments and modern weapons on the European continent." This is obviously a technique for the US and France to jointly put pressure on Britain, which intends to withdraw some troops from Western Europe. Regardless of whether this "view" was put forward by Mollet himself or by Eisenhower, its result can only be beneficial to the US North Atlantic policy and unfavorable to the relationship between Britain and France. Britain and France are jointly facing the squeezing out of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the Middle East, and they also have the same difficulties at home caused by the failure of the aggression against Egypt, but France joined forces with the US to strike a blow against Britain, which was trying to alleviate its own difficulties. This certainly illustrates the complex contradictions in the US-UK-France relationship, but it also illustrates the US insistence on not holding a "three-nation" meeting, but rather holding separate US-France and US-UK talks.

After the talks with Eisenhower, Mollet said in New York that his trip to the United States was "a great victory." However, the fact is that the result of the US-France talks did not add anything to the "unchanging" friendship between the US and France. On the contrary, it made the rifts between them more obvious.

    美法会谈的结果是什么
    高集
    今年1月的美国“外交季刊”刊载的一篇文章，对美国眼中的美英法的联盟关系，作了如下的描述：“美国政府认为在对付共产主义世界时美英法的利益是一致的，但是英法在北非、中东和亚洲的政策同美国的利益并不一致。美国并感到联盟只能在美国认为重要的问题上起作用，而不能在英法认为重要的问题上生效。”无论以过去的或者眼前的事实来看，这段话的确是道破了美国对待它同英法联盟关系的真情实意。
    最近，在华盛顿进行了三天的美法会谈及其结果，就是美国按照上述的公式来对待它的盟国的一次真实的演出。
    在所谓美法联盟的关系中，实际上并不存在着什么“不变”的情谊，相反地却充满了利害冲突的矛盾。在去年法国与英国和以色列发动侵略埃及的战争的事件中，美法的利害冲突又一次公开地暴露了出来，美法关系中的裂口扩大了。挑起侵埃战争的法国总理摩勒和外长比诺，对于美国在侵埃战争中的态度，说了许多伤心话。但是，伤心尽管伤心，摩勒之流还是痴心妄想着美国的“友谊”。在侵埃战争失败之后，摩勒曾一再公开要求同美国总统举行会谈，以“改善”美法关系。可是，法国政府首脑对美国的这种“不变”的情谊，却没有换来对方的热情响应；白宫不愿早日接待摩勒，一直拖到“艾森豪威尔主义”出笼之后才发出请柬。而所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”，正是美国插在美法和美英关系裂口上的又一把刀子；它的目的是要趁英法在中东被削弱的机会，来把它们完全排挤出这个地区，而由美国来充当中东的霸主和宪兵。这就是美国对摩勒访美所预先布好的阵势，也就是艾森豪威尔对法国政府首脑的“不变”的情谊早就作好的一个“不变”的答复。
    美法关系目前的最大的创口是在中东问题上，因此美法会谈所讨论的中心问题也就是中东问题。摩勒在去美国之前曾扬言说，他“不带什么去，也不提出什么要求”，实际上，他到华盛顿去却有着一个重大的目的，就是寻求一个美法之间的所谓“共同的长期中东政策”。这一点，这位法国总理在华盛顿的时候曾公开说了出来，但是结果却完全落空了。在那充满了“友好”字眼的艾森豪威尔和摩勒的联合声明中，对中东问题只说了这样一句空话：他们（即艾森豪威尔与摩勒）共同相信“可以用符合正义和国际法的原则的和平方法获致中东问题的解决。”这种词藻堂皇而毫无实际意义的空话，显然不是摩勒所寻求的那种“共同的长期中东政策”；相反地却反映了美法会谈的结果丝毫也没有改变美国在中东推行排挤英法和实行“单独干”的新的殖民主义计划的决心。联合声明甚至提也没有提一下“艾森豪威尔主义”，这就证明了这个“主义”是如何深重地刺痛着美法之间的“不变”的情谊。
    从字面上看来，美法两国首脑至少在苏伊士运河的问题上表现了一致的态度。在联合声明中，“他们重申他们遵守”去年10月联合国安理会所通过的解决苏伊士运河的六项原则，并特别强调“运河无阻地通航而不加歧视”和“运河的管理与任何国家的政治绝缘”的主张。这里值得注意的是，他们故意忽视六项原则中的最主要之点，就是承认埃及对运河的不可动摇的主权。但是问题是在美法这种表面的一致的背后，各自做着不同的文章。美国从运河被埃及收归国有之后，就一直进行着由美国的石油和航运公司成立一个财团以经营运河的图谋；最近退休的美国将军范佛里特更曾到埃及进行活动，想沿运河修建一条油管，来代替运河。而法国即使在侵埃战争失败之后，也从未放弃“建立一个国际管理运河的制度”的打算，甚至想在这个问题上找出一个美英法的“共同主张”。看来，即使是在这个问题上，美国与法国之间也还是存在着“单独”掠夺和“共同”掠夺的分歧。但是，不管是美国的打算也好，或者是法国的打算也好，它们的共同之点都是无视埃及维护自己主权的坚决意志，而这也就是它们必然要倒霉的地方。
    美法会谈在中东问题上没有能够弥补起它们的裂痕，而在摩勒所津津乐道的“欧洲统一”和所谓“欧非统一”的问题上，也是各怀异心。摩勒不仅在从巴黎到华盛顿的一路上沉醉在“欧洲统一”和“欧非统一”的曲调上，而且在白宫同艾森豪威尔举行的会谈中，也曾强调在这些方面发展的“重要性和速度”。摩勒所以要大张旗鼓地鼓吹这些，这是因为他觉得：“只有通过统一，欧洲才能够重新找到真正的独立”，也才能够同美国有一种“新的关系”，并且才能够使“世界上有三、四个重要的集团而不是只有两个集团”的日子到来。换句话说，这也就是摩勒所追求的“非中立的第三种世界力量”的道路。当然，不能说摩勒的这条道路对法国不是一条道路。问题是如果他把最近西欧六国在共同市场和原子能联营问题上所取得的协议，当作他自己的成就，并且以此作为他的“非中立的第三种世界力量”的本钱，那末，那就不能不是一个可悲的错误。因为，在这个“统一”的欧洲中将起主要作用的恐怕未必是摩勒的社会党的法国，而一定会是阿登纳的西德。而阿登纳同美国的密切关系是人所共知的。摩勒的得意未免是过早了。
    根据会谈发表的联合声明的内容看来，艾森豪威尔只是以冷淡来对待摩勒在“欧洲统一”和“欧非统一”的问题上所表现的片面的热情，艾森豪威尔除了只是对所谓“有关欧洲统一的条约”表示了“个人的关切”以外（注意：只是“个人”的关切）以外，对于所谓“把海外领地与欧洲共同市场联系起来的决定”甚至根本没有表示任何态度。
    摩勒的所谓“欧非统一”，用他自己的话来说，就是：“动员全欧洲的工业力量来提供非洲所需要的社会进步和技术装备”。实际上法国是企图利用主要是西德的资本，来在它的控制下开发和掠夺它的非洲属地，以及包括突尼斯、摩洛哥这些最近独立的非洲国家的计划。法国所以要采取“欧非统一”的办法，而不去寻求美国的资本和援助，这主要是因为法国在印度支那和中东吃足了美国排挤它的苦头。用法国外长比诺的话来说，就是法国“不需要再有印度支那那样的事情”。因此，所谓“欧非统一”，实际上是包含着抗拒美国渗入法国非洲属地的打算。
    但是，在印度支那和中东已经得手的美国势力，难道能够由于法国在非洲高挂起“欧非统一”的招牌，而对非洲望而止步吗？特别是在撒哈拉地区已经发现有包括石油、铀、铜、铁、锰、煤等大量矿藏的情况下，贪得无厌的美国垄断资本能够无动于衷吗？人们可以看到，正当法国积极搞“欧非统一”，并且急急忙忙地成立“撒哈拉地区联合组织”从事开发这个地区的时候，美国也正在锣鼓喧天地向非洲进军。美国众议院外交委员会的弗兰西斯·波尔顿考察团和美国参议院外委会主席格林已于去年8月和今年2月先后发表了考察非洲的报告，这两个报告都强调了非洲“对于美国的重大意义”。波尔顿的报告公开说“开发非洲”是美国“不能逃避”的责任，而格林的报告更毫不隐晦地指出美国私人在突尼斯投资的困难是“由于法国和它的前保护国的经济关系仍然很密切”的缘故。因此，格林建议：“通过长期贷款或者鼓励美国私人资本投资来援助摩洛哥人”，并主张在对外援助计划中“作出对突尼斯的要求的规定”。看来，美国大规模地向非洲渗入，已是箭在弦上，绝不是什么摩勒的“欧非统一”所能阻止得了的。在这种情况下，美国副总统尼克松利用参加加纳（即黄金海岸）独立典礼之便，宣布要到包括突尼斯和摩洛哥的许多非洲国家进行访问，这就不能不被看成是为美国资本渗入非洲的一种开路行动。
    因此，摩勒的“欧非统一”计划实际上将预示着美法将要在非洲展开的一场恶斗。
    当然，也不能说摩勒在美国毫无所获。至少，他同艾森豪威尔在所谓“自由世界”“在欧洲大陆上维持拥有常规军备和现代化武器的部队”的问题上取得了一致的“看法”。这显然是美法联合起来对打算从西欧撤退一部分军队的英国施加压力的一种手法。不管这个“看法”是由摩勒自己提出的，或者是由艾森豪威尔提出的，它的结果只能是有利于美国的北大西洋政策，而不利于英法关系。英法在中东共同面临着“艾森豪威尔主义”的排挤，并且在国内也有着由于侵埃战争失败而造成的同样困难，但是法国却同美国在一道对企图减轻自己困难的英国，横头打了一棒。这固然说明了美英法关系中的复杂的矛盾，但同时也说明了美国坚持不愿举行“三大国”会议，而要分别举行美法和美英会谈的用意。
    摩勒在同艾森豪威尔会谈之后，在纽约说：他的美国之行是“一个很大的胜利”。但是，事实却是美法会谈的结果并没有为美法之间的“不变”的情谊增加什么东西，反而使它们中间的裂痕暴露得更加明显了。
