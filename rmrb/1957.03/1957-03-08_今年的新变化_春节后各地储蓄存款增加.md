    This Year's New Change
    Savings Deposits Increase in Various Places After the Spring Festival
    Xinhua News Agency: This year, after the Spring Festival, mass savings deposits across the country have generally increased rapidly. According to statistics from the People's Bank of China at the end of last month, from February 1st to 20th, mass savings deposits increased by 83.34 million yuan, while in previous years, due to large Spring Festival consumption, savings deposits decreased in the period after the festival. For example, in 1956, there was a decrease of 18.83 million yuan in the twenty days after the festival.
    In Beijing and Shanghai, savings deposits increased by more than 6 million yuan after the Spring Festival, and many employees and residents saved the money originally intended for the Spring Festival and deposited it in the bank. In Changsha, the growth rate of citizen savings deposits in February reached the highest peak since liberation. In the ten days from February 10th to 19th when salaries were paid, citywide savings deposits were more than 80,000 yuan higher than in September after the wage reform and retroactive salary payments last year. Many small vendors in various places saved some of their business income during this period and deposited it in the bank for the off-season.

    今年的新变化
    春节后各地储蓄存款增加
    新华社讯　今年春节过后，全国各地的群众储蓄存款普遍迅速地增加。据中国人民银行上月底统计，从2月1日到20日，群众储蓄存款增加了八千三百三十四万元，而历年因春节消费较大，节后一个时期内储蓄存款都是减少的。如1956年节后二十天就减少了一千八百八十三万元。
    北京、上海两地的储蓄存款在春节后都增加了六百多万元，很多职工和居民把本来准备在春节用的钱节省下来存入银行。长沙市2月份内市民储蓄存款增长的幅度达到了解放以来的最高峰，在2月10日到19日发薪的十天中，全市储蓄存款比去年工资改革后补发薪金的9月份还要多八万多元。很多地方的小商小贩在这个时期内把营业收入节省一些存入银行，以备淡季需要。
