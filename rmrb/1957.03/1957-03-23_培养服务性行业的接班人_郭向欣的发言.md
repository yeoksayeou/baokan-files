Cultivating Successors for Service Industries
Guo Xiangxin's Speech

I feel extremely honored and excited to be able to participate in the Third Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Before the meeting, I heard Chairman Mao's twelve valuable instructions, and at the meeting, I heard the important reports of Premier Zhou and other responsible leaders, which were very enlightening and educational to me, and provided great help and encouragement for my future study and work.

I am a nonvoting delegate from Qingjiang City, Jiangsu Province. Limited by my superficial political theory level and cultural level, I have no special expertise to talk about. I would just like to express my personal opinions on three issues that were hotly debated by the delegates in the group discussion.

First, the issue of appropriate birth control.

I believe this issue is in line with the actual situation. But in my opinion, this is an ordinary social issue, not a serious problem. As long as a few necessary measures are put forward, it can be solved. ① Advocate late marriage and develop natural habits in society. In general, middle school students should not rush into dating before graduating from high school. Even if they have a partner, they should wait until after graduation before getting married. If necessary, the marriage age in the Marriage Law can be revised, with men marrying at thirty and women marrying at twenty-eight. ② Married men and women, if they have too many children, can take contraception or sterilization methods, which should be freely handled and decided according to each family environment. ③ Artificial abortion is best not to be opened; otherwise, it is not good for the labor of doctors, the health of pregnant women, and personal economy.

Why should we view it this way? Because a large land with abundant resources and a large population is China's greatest advantage and characteristic. Since liberation, the rapid recovery of the economy, the rapid increase of industrial and agricultural production, and the decisive victory of the socialist transformation, are of course due to the correct leadership of the working class by the Chinese Communist Party. But the large population and great strength, unity, and concerted efforts are also important factors. If we say that in the future, the population increases, the socialist industrialization will be slower; or that if the population remains at 600 million, our enjoyment of life can be particularly good. Such statements and ideas are not sufficient reasons. The main problem still lies in increasing production and practicing economy. Saving one penny or one tael of rice can accumulate more than 4 billion yuan throughout the year. If we expand it, the number will be even more alarming. Why should we regard population increase as a mental burden, talk about it with horror, and create an artificial atmosphere of tension?

Furthermore, the reserve and newborn forces of a country are also very valuable. A person's growth requires two or three decades, which cannot be cultivated overnight. Constant growth and metabolism are also natural laws. Overemphasizing tension and difficulties, with insufficient understanding by the masses, and the spread of international news, will also bring many adverse effects, which must be prevented and paid attention to. I also agree with the saying that "he who has no foresight will have immediate worries," but the way of publicity should be changed, and we should have a clear understanding in our minds. If this issue is discussed in every large and small meeting, it would be too hasty.

Second, the issue of schooling for middle school and primary school students.

There are some high school students across the country who cannot get into university, and this problem can be overcome. Because high school students already have some basic culture and knowledge, and have considerable conditions for both physical and mental labor, as long as the government cultivates and cares for them, and helps them find employment, the problem can be solved.

The number of children who cannot finish primary school is relatively large. In cities, the phenomenon is not very serious. The main problem lies in rural areas. It is best for agricultural cooperatives to find ways to solve it. More simplified private schools should be set up, and a part-farming and part-study approach should be adopted, which can both learn culture and assist in agricultural production, achieving both goals. Junior high school graduates can also find a way out, such as accountants in agricultural cooperatives and technicians in handicraft cooperatives, and they can be mobilized to work and find employment. Regarding the issue of schooling for senior primary school graduates, social forces can be mobilized to run more simplified junior high school classes, adopting a model of private operation with public assistance, with the joint cooperation, mutual assistance, and mutual support of local Minjian associations, federations of industry and commerce, trade unions, women's federations, and other organizations. Calling on each county and city to be able to run three first-year junior high school classes, which can accommodate 180 students. Counties and cities with potential can run more. If counties and cities across the country share the burden, it can be done easily and the problem can be solved. If each province can solve the problem for 10,000 people, dozens of provinces can solve the problem for hundreds of thousands of people. Next year, on the original basis, add second-year junior high school classes, and the year after that, add third-year junior high school classes. After three years of effort, each county and city can add a small-scale junior high school, which will be of great benefit to the country and the people. But it is easy to say, but difficult to do. The excavation of teacher potential, the planning of housing and equipment, and the raising of funds all have certain difficulties. It is hoped that the National Committee of the CPPCC can vigorously promote and support all members, so that the ideal can become a reality.

Third, the problem of the lack of successors in service industries.

Now, in all parts of the country, industries such as hairdressing, bathhouses, and hotels have this phenomenon, especially in large cities and emerging cities. There are two factors that cause this phenomenon: (1) It is the old view left over from the old society, which believes that people who work in these industries are unpromising and looked down upon, so no one learns this skill anymore; (2) After liberation, although the social atmosphere has changed, many people's attitude towards these service personnel is not respectful enough, and they will still show it intentionally or unintentionally, thinking that they have paid the price and they are there to serve us. Therefore, it will cause these industry service personnel to feel inferior and disgusted, and even change careers. Therefore, the successors of these industries are even more lacking.

I had a chat with a technician from the barber shop of the Qianmen Hotel and learned that their highest salary is 96 yuan, and the lowest is also more than 70 yuan, which is equivalent to the treatment of a section chief and cannot be considered small. Why doesn't it spark their interest? One technician said: "I was transferred from Shanghai to serve here. I deeply feel that the customers I come into contact with here have a very good and polite view of us. It is different in Shanghai. Some people have different views of us. They will lose their temper if they are slightly dissatisfied. At the very least, they think it is a trading relationship and still look down on us." His words are full of emotion. From this, it can be seen that strengthening social education and correcting the view of underestimating labor is a fundamental solution. I put forward the following suggestions: (1) These service industries should be led and managed by the health department, and their wages should be fixed according to the technical level of the region, so that they can work with peace of mind and improve their skills. According to the needs of each region, recruit new trainees to cultivate reserve forces. Large cities can set up schools to recruit students to learn skills. In addition to assigning specialized technicians to teach skills, it is necessary to equip health teachers to instill hygienic knowledge. After graduation, they will be assigned to practice and work. (2) If there are surplus personnel in small and medium-sized cities, they can be coordinated and adjusted to avoid uneven workload. (3) Vigorously carry out social education. Cadre party members should take the lead in respecting service industry personnel, treating them equally, and regarding them as doctors and health personnel, in order to reverse the social atmosphere and improve their service mood and work confidence. If this is done, the successors of the service industry will adapt to social needs and emerge continuously, without the danger of interruption.

I am a nonvoting delegate from a small city, and my knowledge is not extensive. The above is just a limited view, and there are inevitably some embarrassing points. Please criticize and correct me. (Attached picture)

### 培养服务性行业的接班人　郭向欣的发言

　　培养服务性行业的接班人
　　郭向欣的发言
    我这次能够参加中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第三次全体会议，感觉到无上光荣和兴奋。在会前听到了毛主席的十二项宝贵指示，在会议上又听到周总理和各位负责首长的重要报告，受到启发、教育很大，对我今后学习上、工作上，有了很大的帮助和鼓舞。
    我是江苏省清江市一个列席代表，限于政治理论水平和文化水平的肤浅，没有什么专长可谈，仅就小组讨论中有三个问题，各位代表讨论得异常热烈，我也发表我的个人意见。
    第一，人口繁殖必须适当的节育问题。
    我认为这个问题，是符合实际情况的。但我的看法，这是一个普通的社会问题，并不是什么严重问题，只要提出几个必要的措施，即可得到解决。①提倡晚婚，养成社会上自然的习惯。一般的中学生在高中未毕业前，不要忙于谈恋爱，就是有了对象，等到毕业后，再行结婚。必要时，可修改婚姻法上结婚年龄，男子三十而娶，女子二十八而嫁。②已婚男女，如子女过多，可采取避孕或绝孕的办法，视各个家庭环境，自由处理决定。③人工流产，最好仍不开放；否则对医师的劳动、孕妇的健康、个人的经济，均没有好处。
    为什么要这样看法呢？因为地大物博人口多，这是中国最大的优点和特点。解放以来，经济迅速的恢复，工农业生产飞快的提高，社会主义改造事业，取得了决定性的胜利，当然是由于中国共产党工人阶级的正确领导。但人多力量大，团结一致，万众一心，也是重要因素之一。如果说，将来人口增多了，社会主义工业化，就要慢一些；或者说，人口保持六亿，我们的生活享受，就可以格外美好些。这样说法与想法，都不是充分的理由。主要的问题，还是在于增产节约，一分钱、一两米的节约，全年尚可积累四十多亿，如果扩而大之，那数字更加惊人。我们又何必把人口增加当为一个思想包袱，谈虎色变，造成人为的紧张气氛呢。
    再进一步的说，一个国家的后备和新生的力量，也是非常宝贵的。一个人的成长，需要二、三十年，不是一朝一夕所能培养出来的，生生不已，新陈代谢，也是自然规律。过分的强调紧张和困难，群众领会不足，国际听闻的传播，也会带来很多的不良影响，不可不防患未然，加以注意。我也同意人无远虑、必有近忧的说法，但应该变换宣传的方式，掌握心中有数，如果大会小会都谈这个问题，那就未免操之过急了。
    第二，中学生、小学生的就学问题。
    全国有部分的高中生，考不上大学，这个问题是可以克服的。因为高中生，已经具备了一些基本文化和知识，不论体力劳动、脑力劳动，都有相当的条件，只要政府培养照顾，帮助他们安置就业，是可以解决问题的。
    不能上完小的儿童，数字比较大一些。在城市说来，现象尚不十分严重，主要问题在于农村，最好由农业合作社想办法来解决。多办一些简单化的民校，采取半耕半读的办法，既可以学习文化，又可以辅助农业生产的劳动，一举两得，两全其美。初中毕业生也可找到出路，如农业合作社的会计员，手工业合作社的技术员，都可动员他们劳动就业。高小毕业生的就学问题，可以发动社会力量，多办简单化的初中班，采取民办公助，由各地民建会、工商联、工会、妇联等团体通力合作、互相帮助、互相支援。号召每个县市，能够举办初一三个班，即可容纳学生一百八十人，有潜力的县市可以多办，以全国县市来分担，既可轻而易举，也能解决问题。每省能够解决一万人，几十个省就可解决几十万人。明年再在原有基础上，增设初二班，后年增设初三班，有了三年功夫，各县市就可增加一所小有规模的初中学校，对国家、对人民，均有很大好处。但言之非艰，行之不易，师资潜力的挖掘，房屋设备的计划，经费的筹集，都有一定的困难。希望政协全国委员会，能够大力推动全体委员，大力支持，理想是可以成为事实的。
    第三，服务性的行业缺乏接班人的问题。
    现在全国各地，理发、浴室、旅馆等行业都有这种现象，特别是大城市和新兴的城市，更加突出。造成这种现象的原因，有两个因素：（1）是旧社会遗留下来的旧观点，认为做这些行业的人，是没出息的，被人瞧不起，所以也就没有人再学这种技术了；（2）解放以后，社会风气虽然转变，但有不少人，对这些服务员的态度，还不够尊重，在有意与无意之间，还会表现出来，认为自己出了代价，是要他们来侍候我们的。因此，会引起这些行业的服务员的自卑情绪和反感，甚至还有改行转业的。所以这些行业的接班人，就更加缺乏了。
    我曾与前门饭店理发部技术员漫谈过，知道他们工资最高的为九十六元，最低的也有七十多元，等于科长级待遇，不能算小。为什么还提不起他们的兴趣呢，有一个技术员这样说：“我是由上海调到这里来服务的，我深深的感觉到，我在这里工作所接触的顾客，对我们的看法很好，也很有礼貌；在上海就不同了，有些人对我们看法就不同，稍不如意就要发脾气，最低的认为是买卖关系，对我们还是轻视的。”言下有不胜感慨之意。于此可见，加强社会教育，纠正轻视劳动观点，是一个根本性的解决办法。我提出以下几个建议：（1）把这些服务性的行业，由卫生部门来领导管理，把他们的工资，按地区技术等级固定下来，使他们安心工作、提高技术。视每个地区的需要，招收新的学艺人员，培养后备力量，大都市可设立学校，招收学艺的学生，除调配专门技师教授技术外，必须配备卫生教师，灌输卫生常识，毕业后即行分配实习和工作。（2）中小城市如有过剩人员，可以统筹调剂，以免忙闲不均现象。（3）大力开展社会教育。由干部党团员带头，对服务性行业人员的尊重，一视同仁，把他们作为医师和卫生人员看待，以扭转社会风气，提高他们的服务情绪和工作信心。如果这样做，服务性行业的接班人，就会适应社会需要，源源产生，不致有中断之虞了。
    我是一个小城市的列席代表，见闻不广，以上所谈只是坐井观天之见，难免有些贻笑大方之处，请各位代表，多加批评和指正。（附图片）
