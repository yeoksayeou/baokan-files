    The representatives attending the National Conference of Agricultural Labor Models believe that the reception they received from Chairman Mao and other central leaders was the highest reward given to them.

    On the afternoon of the 27th, the reporter encountered the representatives of the Shanxi delegation looking at the photos taken with Chairman Mao. They all said excitedly that this was the best prize to take back from this meeting. Everyone also talked about a story: Zhang Rulin, director of the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Yu County, and an old model worker, Zhang Laotai, who lived on the next bed, couldn't sleep the night they received this photo. The two of them talked about how they had wanted to see Chairman Mao after the victory as far back as the Anti-Japanese War period, about the process of striving for increased production by running agricultural cooperatives last year, and also about how to ensure a bumper harvest this year. Zhang Rulin is only twenty-eight years old this year, and he has been unable to contain his excitement these past few days, writing two letters home in a row, reporting on the "unimaginable sights" they had seen.

    The old labor models Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, and Wu Houli had a different feeling after seeing Chairman Mao. Although their agricultural cooperatives also had great achievements last year, they felt that their output was still very low, and therefore their contribution to the country was small. Chairman Mao cares so much for them that they must produce even greater achievements this year. To this end, Li Shunda and Guo Yu'en exchanged views on how to strive for a bumper harvest this year, and each made a plan. In addition to striving for a bumper harvest of grain, both plan to greatly develop the production of orchards, sheep raising, and pig raising this year.

    Lu Hongbin, a famous agricultural labor model in Shandong Province, had the same feeling after seeing Chairman Mao. He told reporters: "The leading comrades told us not to be proud and complacent. I heard about other people's bumper harvests at this meeting, and I feel that it won't work if I don't work harder, I'm falling behind!"

    The labor models from Hubei Province have also been very excited these past few days. Wang Yushan, the secretary of the Communist Party branch in Dadu Township, Xinzhou County, who led the entire township to achieve a per-mu yield of 101 jin of ginned cotton last year, discussed the matter of increasing production this year with another labor model on the night Chairman Mao received them, discussing "how to do things this year to be worthy of the Communist Party and worthy of Chairman Mao!" He told reporters: Before coming to Beijing for the meeting, he always thought that the cotton yield in his township was already high enough. He only realized that although he had been planting cotton for most of his life, there were still many things he had not learned, and he had not done some good experiences last year. He must do it this year and strive for a greater harvest, so he can come to Beijing to see Chairman Mao again.

    When the reporter asked Li Fenglan, a female labor model from Hebei Province, she said that on the night she met with Chairman Mao, she wrote letters to all the members of her cooperative and to her lover. The beginning of each letter read: "I really don't know what to tell you first. I saw Chairman Mao with my own eyes. He is in good health. I want to take the photo with Chairman Mao back and make you all happy too."

    On the night Chairman Mao received them, most of the representatives from Jiangsu Province wrote letters of determination to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, guaranteeing to strive for a bumper harvest in 1957. The reporter also saw a letter from Wei Shuchun, a Zhuang farmer from Yishan County, Guangxi, to his fellow villagers. The letter said: "The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao attach great importance to our ethnic minorities. It is really a great honor. On the morning of the 22nd, I saw the great Chairman Mao with my own eyes."

    The famous labor model Geng Changsuo said it well: "I have seen Chairman Mao several times, but every time I am received, it is like the first time I met him, giving me great strength. Our production plan for this year has been drawn up, and with the strength Chairman Mao has given us, increased production is as good as seen (meaning very confident)." (Xinhua News Agency)

    最高的奖赏
    出席全国农业劳动模范代表会议的代表们认为，这次毛主席和其他中央领导人接见他们，是给他们的最高的奖赏。
    27日下午，记者在山西代表团那里，遇到代表们正在看和毛主席合照的相片。他们都兴奋地说，这是这次开会带回去的最好的奖品。大家还谈到一个故事：盂县前进农业社主任张儒林在接到这张相片的那天晚上，和邻床一位老模范张老太一直睡不着。他们两个人说到远在抗日战争时期就想望胜利后见毛主席，谈到去年办农业社争取增产的经过，还谈到怎样保证今年大丰收。张儒林今年才二十八岁，这几天一直按捺不住兴奋的心情，一连写了两封家信，报告他们“一辈子想不到的见闻”。
    老劳动模范李顺达、郭玉恩、武侯梨看了毛主席后有另外一种心情。虽然去年他们的农业社也有很大的成绩，但他们感到比产量他们还很低，因而对国家的贡献很小。毛主席对他们这样关怀，今年必须拿出更大的成绩来。为此，李顺达和郭玉恩交换了怎样争取今年大丰收的意见，又各自订了计划。除争取粮食丰收外，两个人都打算今年把果园、养羊、养猪等生产大发展一下。
    山东省著名农业劳动模范吕鸿宾在见毛主席后有同样的心情，他告诉记者说：“领导同志们嘱咐我们不要骄傲自满。我这次开会听了别人的丰收成绩，觉着再不努力，是不行了，落后了呀！”
    来自湖北省的劳动模范们这几天也一直很激动。去年领导全乡皮棉亩产一百零一斤的新洲县大渡乡中共支部书记王玉山，在毛主席接见的那天晚上，和另一个劳动模范商量今年增产的事，商量“今年怎样办才能对得起共产党，对得起毛主席！”他告诉记者：来北京开会以前，他一直认为他乡里的棉花产量已经够高了。会上听到还有更高的，而且听到很多种棉的好经验，才发觉自己虽然种了大半辈子的棉花，还有许多没有学到的东西，有些好经验去年他都没有作到。今年一定做到，争取更大的丰收，好再来北京见毛主席。
    当记者问到河北省女劳动模范李凤兰的时候，她说，在和毛主席见面的当天晚上，她给本社全体社员，给爱人都写了信，信的开头都是这样写的：“我真不知道先告诉你们什么好。我亲眼看见毛主席了。他身体很好。我要把和毛主席合照的相片带回去，给你们也高兴高兴。”
    江苏省的代表们在毛主席接见的当天晚上，大多数就给党中央和毛主席写了保证争取1957年大丰收的决心书。记者还看到广西宜山县僮族农民韦舒纯给乡亲写的一封信。信上说：“党中央和毛主席对我们少数民族多重视啊。真是万分光荣呀，22日上午，我亲眼看到伟大的毛主席了。”
    著名的劳动模范耿长锁说得好：“我已经见过毛主席好几次了，可是每一次接见都像头一次见面一样，给我很大的力量，今年我们的生产计划订出来了，有毛主席给我们的力量，增产就像看到了一样（意指很有把握）。” （新华社）
