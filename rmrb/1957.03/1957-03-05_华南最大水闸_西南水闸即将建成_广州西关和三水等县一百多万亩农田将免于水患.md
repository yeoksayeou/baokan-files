    Southwest Sluice Gate, the Largest in South China, Nears Completion
    Over One Million Mu of Farmland in Guangzhou's Xiguan and Sanshui Counties Will Be Spared from Floods
    (Our dispatch) The Southwest Sluice Gate project, the largest in South China, will be completed before the spring flood season. The Southwest Sluice Gate is part of the Beijiang River basin project in Guangdong. Construction officially began in late October last year. It is 106 meters long and 9.6 meters high.
    When the floods of the Beijiang and Xijiang rivers converge, the downstream water level often rises, causing flooding in the Xiguan area of Guangzhou. After the completion of the Southwest Sluice Gate and the restoration of the Lubao Sluice Gate, not only will the water flow be controlled, but water will also be diverted for irrigation, ensuring that more than 1.3 million mu of farmland in Guangzhou's Xiguan area, as well as Sanshui, Nanhai, Panyu and other counties, are spared from floods, and that 140,000 mu of waterlogged wasteland in Nanhai and Sanshui counties are turned into fertile land.

    华南最大水闸——西南水闸即将建成
    广州西关和三水等县一百多万亩农田将免于水患
    本报讯  华南最大的西南水闸工程将在春汛前建成。西南水闸是广东北江流域工程之一，去年10月下旬正式动工兴建，全长达一百零六公尺，高九点六公尺。
    北江、西江的洪水会集时，往往下游水位高涨，致使广州市西关地区遭受水淹。西南水闸建成和芦苞水闸修复后，不仅能控制水的流量，同时还能引水灌溉农田，保障广州市西关地区以及三水、南海、番禺等县一百三十多万亩农田免于水患，使南海、三水两县所属十四万亩积水荒地变为良田。（附图片）
