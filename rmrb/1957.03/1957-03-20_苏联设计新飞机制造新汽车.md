    The Soviet Union Designs New Aircraft, Manufactures New Automobiles

    Whale-sized Transport Aircraft
    The renowned Soviet aircraft designer Antonov is designing a "Flying Whale" transport aircraft. This aircraft is as large as a whale in the sea. It can carry assembled cars, bulldozers, giant lathes, and even relatively small assembled houses. City buses can freely drive into the cabin from the large door at the rear of the aircraft. This aircraft's gasoline consumption is about half that of any of the Soviet Union's current transport aircraft.

    Compact and Exquisite "Little Bee" Aircraft
    Soviet aircraft designers are engrossed in designing the "Little Bee" aircraft. This aircraft has take-off and landing performance similar to a helicopter, but in other aspects, it is superior to helicopters. It is greatly needed for short-distance transportation (such as transporting mail, small cargo, and patients) and agricultural production work. It can fly as slowly as 35 to 40 kilometers per hour, and as fast as over 200 kilometers per hour. It is very convenient to use, and can take off or land on a field of 40 to 60 meters long. Flat fields, roads, and collective farm threshing grounds can all serve as "airports" for the "Little Bee." Any car driver can pilot it.

    A Dazzling Array of Automobiles
    This year is a year of great development for the Soviet automobile industry. The number and variety of buses produced are unprecedented in the history of the Soviet automobile industry. Among them are small vehicles for rural use, large vehicles for urban use that can carry 60 people, and vehicles for travel and suburban use. These new vehicles are all comfortable and beautiful.

    Currently, the Soviet Union's truck production ranks second in the world, and this year it will expand the production quantity and variety of trucks. The Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates that trucks with a load capacity of 40 to 50 tons should be manufactured in the near future. The task of producing this largest domestically-produced Soviet truck is being completed by the Minsk Automobile Factory.

    In terms of automobile production, the five-seater "Volga" car produced by the Molotov Automobile Factory in Gorky is the firstborn of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, and it will replace the "Victory" car. This new brand of car has a top speed of 130 kilometers per hour.

    苏联设计新飞机制造新汽车
    像鲸鱼样大的运输机
    苏联著名的飞机设计师安东诺夫正在设计“飞鲸”式运输机，这种飞机大得像海上的鲸鱼一样。它能够载运装配好的汽车、推土机、巨型车床，甚至不太大的装配好的房子。城市公共汽车可以从机身后部的大门自由地开进机舱。这种飞机的汽油消耗比苏联目前的任何运输机要节省一半左右。
    小巧玲珑的“小蜜蜂”飞机
    苏联飞机设计师正在埋头设计“小蜜蜂”飞机。这种飞机的起飞和着陆性能近似直升飞机，而在其他方面却比直升飞机优越。它对短距离运输（如运送邮件、小宗货物、病人）和农业生产工作是很需要的。它每小时最慢可以飞行三十五到四十公里，最快可以飞行二百多公里。它使用起来很方便，能够在四十到六十公尺长的场地上起飞或降落，像田间平地、大路和集体农庄的打谷场上都可以作“小蜜蜂”的“机场”。任何汽车司机都能驾驶它。
    各式汽车琳琅满目
    今年是苏联汽车工业大发展的一年。生产的公共汽车的数量和式样之多在苏联汽车工业的历史上是空前的。其中有供农村使用的小型车，有供城市使用的可载六十人的大型车，还有供旅行和城郊使用的汽车，这些新式车辆都很舒适美观。
    目前苏联卡车生产量已经占世界第二位，今年还要扩大卡车生产数量和品种。第六个五年计划规定要在最近制造载重四十吨到五十吨的汽车。生产这种苏联国内载重量最大的汽车的任务正在由明斯克汽车工厂完成。
    在小汽车生产方面，高尔基城莫洛托夫汽车工厂生产的五个座位的“伏尔加”牌小汽车是第六个五年计划的头生子，它将代替“胜利”牌汽车。这种新牌汽车时速达一百三十公里。
