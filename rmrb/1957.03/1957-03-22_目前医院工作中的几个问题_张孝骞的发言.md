Several Problems in Current Hospital Work
Zhang Xiaoqian's Speech

I am a medical worker and would like to raise some issues regarding hospital work for the reference of the members and comrades.

Since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, health work has made great achievements. Preventive measures, medical institutions, and medical education have all seen unprecedented progress and improvement. After being educated and undergoing self-reform by the Party, the vast majority of medical personnel have abandoned their past bourgeois individualism and established a point of view of serving the people. Medical and health workers across the country are making their greatest efforts to realize the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) in terms of health.

Urban medical work, like other health and medical work, has also made great progress. The doors of hospitals have been opened to the working people, the number of beds has greatly increased, and the service attitude and medical style of doctors have improved. The number of people seeking medical treatment in various hospitals has increased year by year, and the quality of work is constantly improving. These achievements should be affirmed. However, due to the rapid development of cities and the increase in urban population, the existing medical conditions still lag behind the needs of the urban people. Citizens and public employees still feel many inconveniences when seeing a doctor; for example, they cannot get a registration number, cannot be admitted to the hospital, spend a lot of time waiting for a diagnosis, and spend a lot of time getting medicine. Many hospitals show signs of being busy, crowded, and even chaotic. Some medical personnel, either busy with affairs or limited by their level of expertise, are still unable to completely avoid medical errors. These difficulties certainly have certain objective reasons, and are mainly problems in development, which can be gradually overcome through the joint efforts of health administrative departments and the vast number of medical personnel. Given the existing manpower and resources, can we partially overcome these problems by improving our working methods? I believe that as long as we follow Chairman Mao's instructions on overall planning and proper arrangements, and pay attention to the organization and coordination of various hospitals, this can be achieved.

Further Improve the Organization and Management System of Hospitals

Clinical medicine is an applied science; because its working object is people, it can also be said to be a social science; its division of labor is detailed, the subjects are many, and the scope is wide. Therefore, the organizational structure of a hospital is quite complex, even more complex than factories and railways, and the various departments and work procedures of the hospital must be closely linked, allowing no disconnection, which is very similar to factories and railways. In the Soviet Union and other medically advanced countries, hospital management, like factory management and railway management, is a specialized discipline, which has not been valued in our country. The organization and management of many hospitals are not strict enough; the rules and regulations are not perfect enough, and their implementation is not thorough enough. This reduces work efficiency and makes it difficult for medical technicians to exert their potential.

Secondly, the connection and cooperation between hospitals in the same city are also very important. Hospitals have clear tasks and different conditions. In order to collectively exert the greatest strength to the people, they must have a good division of labor method. Currently, various hospitals have not achieved such a reasonable division of labor. There is no communication between hospitals, and their work lacks connection and coordination. The outpatient, emergency, and ward departments of some hospitals are very crowded, while other hospitals are relatively idle. A Soviet expert who visited our country last year found that the bed utilization rate of some hospitals was very low and specifically reminded us to pay attention. Recently, Beijing has started a "hierarchical division of labor" medical system, which is a good remedy, but it is not implemented thoroughly enough, and the effect is not very significant. We need to implement this superior system more widely and more effectively.

Improve the Relationship between Hospitals and Patients

Thirdly, is the relationship between hospitals and patients. Hospitals serve the people, so of course they cannot be separated from the masses. On the other hand, fighting against disease is the common task of medical workers and patients, and their comrade-like relationship is an important factor in determining victory in this struggle. The quality of this relationship depends to a large extent on the quality and level of the doctor, and also depends on the patient's trust and cooperation with the hospital and doctor. In this regard, the Soviet Union has done a very good job. Their hospitals do not have the so-called work and rest issues. Our hospitals still have some abnormal phenomena, some are that the doctors' attitudes and styles are not good enough, and some are that the patients do not abide by the hospital rules, do not trust the doctors, and do not obey the treatment. These phenomena are of course individual, but the impact has already created chaos among some patients, and made some medical staff have concerns in their minds, and in their work they tend to be passive, accommodating, and constrained. These effects will not be good for the quality of medical care and the interests of patients.

Overcome the Busy and Chaotic Phenomena in Hospital Work

If the above-mentioned relationships can be improved, I believe that some of the busy and chaotic phenomena in the current hospital work can be overcome. Therefore, I make the following suggestions: 1. Health administrative departments at all levels should strengthen the supervision of the administrative management of their affiliated hospitals. The Ministry of Health, based on the actual domestic situation and on the premise of facilitating patients and improving work efficiency, should formulate hospital regulations applicable to the whole country and require strict implementation. 2. Promote and implement the hierarchical division of labor medical system, and establish an agency to coordinate the use of hospital beds in the city to prevent patients from concentrating in a few hospitals and achieve division of labor and cooperation between hospitals. 3. Hospitals in various places should frequently exchange experience in administrative management, expand the Hospital Administration Committee of the Chinese Medical Association, publish journals on hospital management, and open classes in qualified medical colleges or hospitals to train administrative management talents for hospitals at all levels. 4. Through various publicity and education efforts, including the publicity and education that hospitals and doctors themselves should do, the general public should acquire necessary health knowledge and medical treatment knowledge, understand the nature and rules and regulations of the hospital, and listen to the treatment and guidance of doctors. 5. Strengthen the ideological education and sense of responsibility of medical staff at all levels, break the current atmosphere of buck-passing, accommodation, and not daring to take bold responsibility, and normalize the relationship between hospitals and patients.

Develop Nursing Schools Under the Conditions of Increasing Production and Practicing Economy

Another issue related to hospital work is the nurse issue. Nurses are important members of medical staff, and nursing is an important part of medical work. The ratio of doctors to nurses should generally be one to four in order to work effectively. At present, there are approximately 60,000 to 70,000 Western medicine doctors in our country (not many traditional Chinese medicine doctors participate in hospital work), and approximately 100,000 nurses, with a ratio of almost one to one. Therefore, the shortage of nurses is a relatively common phenomenon. This issue has already attracted the attention of the Ministry of Health, the Chinese Nursing Association, and other relevant parties. Expanding the nursing team requires strengthening nursing education. It is undeniable that nursing education has not received the attention it deserves in the past. Vigorously developing nursing schools will be the most fundamental link in solving the nurse problem in the future. This will require detailed plans and preparations. One of the current problems is how to start this work under the conditions of the state calling for increasing production and practicing economy. I believe that the simplest and easiest way is to widely establish small nursing schools in all qualified hospitals, including provincial and municipal hospitals and affiliated hospitals of medical colleges. If the number of students in each school is not too large, the existing technical personnel of the hospital can be used as teachers, the existing equipment can be used as internship sites, and the existing houses can be used as classrooms and dormitories; only a very small number of full-time teachers and a very small amount of equipment need to be added. This can meet the principle of running schools diligently and frugally. Establishing fifty new schools, each enrolling fifty to one hundred students, can conservatively train 2,500 to 5,000 more nursing students immediately, and can be increased year by year thereafter. In fact, nursing schools are not entirely a burden to the hospitals where they are located, because the process of nursing students doing ward internships can play a certain role in improving the quality of nursing; and these students are the reserve force of nursing staff that each hospital urgently needs to supplement, and will be warmly welcomed. The only possible obstacle is the school system. In the past, medical education departments wanted to run nursing education centrally and did not let hospitals run it themselves. Whether this view should be changed is another matter. At least in the current situation of shortage of nursing staff, the curriculum standards can be slightly relaxed, so that the nurses trained may be lower than the ideal standard, but it is better than not having received systematic training at all. I hope that the medical education department will consider this method together with the Chinese Nursing Association, and if it is feasible, strive to implement it this autumn when many junior high school graduates need to go to school.

The above opinions may be one-sided and not correct enough. Please correct me, members and comrades. (Attached picture)

### 目前医院工作中的几个问题　张孝骞的发言

　　目前医院工作中的几个问题
　　张孝骞的发言
    我是一个医务工作者，想提出几个有关医院工作的问题，供各位委员、各位同志的参考。
    解放以来，在党和政府的正确领导下，卫生工作有了很大的成就。预防措施、医疗机构和医学教育都有空前的进展与提高。医务人员经过党的教育和自我改造，绝大多数抛弃了过去的资产阶级个人主义立场，树立了为人民服务的观点。全国医务卫生工作者正在为了实现农业发展纲要（草案）对卫生方面的要求而作出最大的努力。
    城市医疗工作，同其他卫生医疗工作一样，也有很大的进展。医院的大门为劳动人民敞开了，病床大大地增加了，医生的服务态度和医疗作风改善了。各医院的就诊人数逐年增涨，工作质量在不断地提高。这些成绩是应当加以肯定的。但是由于都市的迅速发展和都市人口的增加，现有的医疗条件仍然落后于都市人民的需要。市民和公教人员看病，还感到许多不便之处；例如挂不上号，住不上院，候诊费时，取药费时等等。不少医院显出忙迫、拥挤、甚至混乱的现象。部分医务人员，或者忙于事务，或者限于水平，还不能完全做到不出医疗差错。这些困难当然有一定的客观原因，而且主要是发展中的问题，通过卫生行政部门和广大医务人员的共同努力，是可以逐渐克服的。就现有的人力和物力，能不能够通过工作方法的改善部分地加以克服呢？我相信，只要遵照毛主席给我们的关于统筹兼顾、适当安排的指示，对各医院的组织工作和协调工作予以重视，这是可以做到的。
　　进一步完善医院的组织管理制度
    临床医学是一门应用科学；因为它的工作对象是人，也可以说是社会科学；它的分工细、科目多、范围广。因此，医院的组织机构相当复杂，比之工厂、铁路甚至更复杂，而医院各部门之间、各工作程序之间必须密切联系，不容有丝毫脱节，又同工厂、铁路很相似。在苏联和其他医学先进国家，医院管理，同工厂管理、铁路管理一样，是一项专门学科，在我国还没有被重视。许多医院的组织、管理不够严密；规章、制度不够完善，实行不够彻底。这就减低了工作效能，使得医疗技术人员不容易发挥他们的潜在力量。
    其次，在同一城市，各医院间的联系和合作也很重要。医院各有明确的任务、各具不同的条件，为了集体地向人民发挥最大的力量，它们之间必须有很好的分工办法。目前各医院是没有做到这样的合理分工的。医院与医院之间互不通声气，彼此的工作缺乏联系，没有协调。某些医院的门诊、急诊和病室很拥挤，另一些医院则比较空闲。前年一位苏联专家来我国访问，发现有些医院的病床使用率很低，特别提醒我们注意。最近北京市开始了“分级分工”的医疗制度，这是很好的补救办法，但实行不够彻底，效果还不很大。我们有必要更广泛地、更有效地贯彻这个优越的制度。
　　改善医院和病人的关系
    再其次，是医院与病人的关系。医院是为人民服务的，当然离不开群众。从另一方面说，向疾病做斗争是医务工作者同病人的共同任务，他们之间的战友般关系，是决定在这个斗争中获得胜利的一个重要因素。这个关系的好坏，在相当大的程度上取决于医生的品质和水平，同时也取决于病人对医院和医生的信任与合作。在这方面，苏联是做得很理想的，他们的医院没有所谓工休问题；我们的医院还存在着一些不正常的现象，有的是医生的态度、作风不够好，有的是病人不遵守院章，不信任医生，不服从治疗。这些现象当然是个别的，但影响所及，已经在一部分病人中造成混乱，使一部分医务人员在思想上有顾虑，在工作中流于被动、迁就、束手束脚。这些影响对于医疗质量和病人的利益是不会有好处的。
　　克服医院工作中的忙乱现象
    以上所讲的几种关系，若能加以改善，相信目前医院工作中的一部分忙乱现象是可以克服的。因此，我提出以下的建议：1．各级卫生行政部门对所属医院加强行政管理方面的监督。卫生部根据国内实际情况，在便利病人和提高工作效能的前提下，制定全国适用的医院法规，并要求严格实行。2．推广和贯彻分级分工的医疗制度，设立统筹全市病床使用的机构，防止病人集中少数医院，做到各医院间的分工合作。3．各地医院经常交流行政管理方面的经验，扩大中华医学会的医院行政委员会，出版医院管理的期刊，就具备条件的医学院校或医院，开班训练各级医院行政管理人才。4．通过各种宣传教育，包括医院和医师自己应做的宣传教育，使广大群众获得必要的卫生常识和就诊常识，了解医院的性质和规章制度，听从医生的治疗和指导。5．加强各级医务人员的思想教育和责任感，打破目前的推诿、迁就、不敢大胆负责的风气，使医院、病人间的关系趋于正常化。
　　在增产节约的条件下发展护士学校
　　另一个与医院工作有关的问题是护士问题。护士是医务人员中的重要成员，护理是医疗工作中的重要部分。医生与护士的人数比例，一般应当是一比四，才能有效地进行工作。现在我国大约有西医六万人至七万人（中医参加医院工作者还不太多），护士约十万人，二者的比例几乎是一比一。因此，护士缺乏是比较普遍的现象。这个问题已经引起了卫生部、中华护士学会和各有关方面的注意。扩大护士队伍，就要加强护士教育。无庸讳言，护士教育过去是没有受到应有的重视的。大力发展护士学校，将是今后解决护士问题的最基本环节。这将需要详细的计划和准备。目前的一个问题是，在国家号召增产节约的条件下，怎样来开始进行这项工作。我认为最简便易行的办法是，在一切具备条件的医院，包括省、市立医院和医学院附属医院，广泛设立小型的护士学校。若是每校的学生不过多，可以利用医院的现有技术人员任教师，现有设备做实习场所，匀用现有房屋做课室和宿舍；需要增加的只是极少数的专任教员和极少量的设备。这样可以符合勤俭办学校的原则。以建立五十个新校，每校收五十——一百名学生，作保守的计算，即刻可以多训练二千五百——五千名护士学生，以后还可以逐年增加。实际上护士学校对所在医院并不完全是负担，因为护士学生进行病室实习的过程，对护理质量的提高可以起一定的作用；而且这些学生就是各医院急待补充的护理人员的后备军，会受到热烈的欢迎的。唯一可能的障碍是学制。护士教育，医学教育部门过去要集中办，不放手让各医院自办。这个看法应否改变是另一个问题。至少在目前护理人员缺乏的情况下，课程标准似乎可以稍微放宽一些，这样培养出来的护士可能比理想的标准低一些，但总比没有受过系统训练的好得多。希望医学教育部门会同中华护士学会考虑这个办法，若是可行的话，争取在今年秋季，很多初中毕业生需要升学的时候开始实行。
    以上的意见可能是片面的，不够正确的，请各位委员、各位同志指正。（附图片）
