Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 28th: More than five hundred technicians in Tianjin's light industrial factories have formulated 352 scientific and technological research projects to solve key problems such as the current shortage of raw materials and low product quality. From the 15th to the 27th, the Tianjin First Bureau of Light Industry held a meeting of technicians to repeatedly discuss these projects and determine research schedules and responsible persons.

The characteristics of these research projects are that the content is specific, the research time is short, and they can quickly improve production and achieve economic results. The "Dual-Gas Vulcanization Method" being researched by the technicians of the No. 1 Rubber Factory aims to increase vulcanization efficiency by one-third and improve the physical properties of the product by more than 35%. Technicians at the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory are researching a two-layer, segmented outsole method without increasing the amount of rubber, with the goal of extending the service life of sneakers by approximately 20%. Technicians from the Danhua and Zhonghua Match Factories are researching the use of hematite powder to replace pure iron oxide, which is in short supply on the market. It is estimated that this research, once successful, could save 30,000 yuan annually. Among these research projects, there are also 98 projects related to the manufacture of new products, including high-grade instrument glass, vitamins, and tires.

　　天津轻工业工厂五百多技术人员
　　订出研究项目解决生产关键
    新华社天津28日电  天津市轻工业工厂中的五百多名技术人员，为解决当前的原料不足、产品质量低等关键问题，制定了三百五十二项科学技术研究项目。天津市第一轻工业局15日到27日召开技术人员会议，对这些项目进行了反复讨论，并且确定了研究时间和负责人。
    这些研究项目的特点是内容具体，研究时间短，能够迅速改进生产收到经济效果。橡胶一厂技术人员正在研究的“两气并用硫化法”，研究的目标是要使硫化效率提高三分之一，产品的物理性能提高35％以上。大中华橡胶厂的技术人员在不增加橡胶的条件下，研究采用两层分断大底的方法，计划使球鞋的穿用期限延长20％左右。丹华、中华两个火柴厂的技术人员研究以赤铁矿粉代替市场供应不足的纯氧化铁，研究成功后，预计全年可节约三万元。在这些研究项目中，还有九十八项是关于制造新产品的，其中有高级仪器玻璃、维生素、轮胎等。
