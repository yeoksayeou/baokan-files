Vietnam is an Inseparable Whole
By Zhan Chao, Our Correspondent

Under the manipulation of the United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee, the proposal to have the Security Council consider admitting South Korea and South Vietnam into the United Nations was passed on January 30. This news aroused resolute opposition from all strata of the Vietnamese people. On February 26, Pham Van Dong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, wrote to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference (the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union and Great Britain) and the French Foreign Minister, Pineau, severely condemning the French government's perfidious behavior and resolutely protesting the new conspiracy of the United States and its accomplices to permanently divide Vietnam.

The Vietnamese people are currently expressing their active support for the solemn position of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam through various means. "Vietnam is an inseparable whole!" This common slogan is shouted in meetings, in articles, in books, and in speeches.

Even the most hypocritical historians cannot deny that Vietnam, from the Friendship Pass to the Ca Mau Peninsula, belongs to a unified country. However, the United States is attempting to erase this ironclad fact. In order to turn South Vietnam into its military base and colony, after obstructing the Vietnamese people from conducting free general elections as scheduled to unify their motherland, the U.S. imperialists recently went to great lengths to "direct" the ugly farce of so-called "absorbing" the South Korean and South Vietnamese regimes as "members" of the United Nations; the French government, as a signatory to the Geneva Accords, actually adopted the same position as the United States, and its representative at the UN General Assembly Political Committee on January 30 even said that the South Vietnamese regime was "qualified" to be a "member state" of the United Nations; and the British government, as one of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, also voted in favor at this meeting. This act of openly undermining the Geneva Accords and violating the interests of the Vietnamese nation has been spurned by the Vietnamese people.

The famous Vietnamese historian Tran Huy Lieu said indignantly: "Vietnam is an inseparable whole, and this is a truth that no one can change. No matter what, the Vietnamese people will resolutely and unswervingly respect and correctly implement the Geneva Accords, and strive to unify their motherland through free general elections. No matter what means the U.S. imperialists and their followers adopt in their conspiracy to permanently divide Vietnam, they will ultimately be completely defeated." (Hanoi dispatch, March 2)

    越南是不可分割的整体
    本报记者  展潮
    联合国大会特别政治委员会在美国的操纵下，于1月30日竟然通过要安全理事会考虑接受南朝鲜和南越加入联合国的提案。这个消息传出后，引起越南各阶层人民坚决反对。越南民主共和国政府外交部部长范文同特就此事在2月26日分别写信给日内瓦会议两位主席（苏联和英国外交部长）和法国政府外交部长比诺，严正地指责法国政府这种背信弃义的行为和坚决抗议美国及其帮凶企图长期分割越南的新阴谋。
    越南人民目前正通过各种方式，表示积极支持越南民主共和国政府的严正立场。“越南是不可分割的整体！”在会议上，在文章里，在书籍里面，在发言中，人们高呼着这个共同的口号。
    即使是最虚伪的历史家，也不得不承认越南是从睦南关到金瓯角属于一个统一的国家。但是，美国却企图一手抹杀掉这个铁的事实。为了把越南南方变成它的军事基地和殖民地，美帝国主义者在阻挠越南人民不能如期进行自由普选、统一自己的祖国之后，最近又极力地“导演”所谓“吸收”南朝鲜和越南南方政权为联合国“会员”的丑戏；作为日内瓦协定签字国的法国政府居然也和美国采取了同一的立场，它的代表在1月30日的联大政委会上竟说越南南方政权“有资格”作为联合国的“会员国”；而作为日内瓦会议两位主席之一的英国政府，也在这次会议上投了赞成票。这种公然破坏日内瓦协议、违背越南民族利益的行为，遭到越南人民的唾弃。
    越南著名的历史学家陈辉燎愤慨地说：“越南是一个不可分割的整体，这是任谁都改变不了的真理。无论怎样，越南人民将坚决不渝地尊重和正确地贯彻日内瓦协议，争取用自由普选的方式以达到统一自己的祖国。美帝国主义和它的随从者无论采取这种或那种方式企图长期分割越南的阴谋，最后必将遭到彻底的失败。”（3月2日河内电）
