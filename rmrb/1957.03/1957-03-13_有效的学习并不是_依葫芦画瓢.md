    Effective Learning is Not "Blind Imitation"
    By our reporter Ji Yin

    Recently, while learning about the increase production and conservation movement in factories, I casually talked with some comrades about a problem encountered in modifying product designs, namely, how to correctly treat Soviet industrial product drawings. This problem has a certain universality, and I will write it down here now.

    In recent years, with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, some mechanical and electrical factories in Shanghai have obtained many valuable technical materials, including drawings of various products. These product drawings are the result of the long-term creative labor of the Soviet people, and they specifically and vividly embody the superiority of the socialist system. In recent years, many factories in Shanghai have produced various new types of mechanical and electrical products according to these drawings, which has enriched the production content of these factories and greatly changed the backward appearance of these factories in production.

    In the recent increase production and conservation movement, some factories in Shanghai have universally launched activities to improve product design, and have also inspected the work of learning Soviet product drawings. During the inspection, they found that in the past, in the work of learning Soviet product drawings, in a few products, there were subjective methods of not proceeding from reality and mechanically copying, which resulted in a lot of waste and made these products very inconvenient to use. Shanghai Precision Medical Instrument Factory, a state-owned enterprise, has produced many new medical instruments according to Soviet drawings. Most of these instruments are very good, but for some products, they did not combine them with China's specific conditions during imitation, and the products were not well made. For example, the bed of an X-ray machine they produced was completely produced according to the original design, without considering that Soviet people are generally taller, while Chinese people are smaller, resulting in the bed being too high and large, which wasted steel and was inconvenient to use. Shorter doctors have to stand on stools to work when examining patients. For example, the foot switch of the X-ray machine they produced was also made too large for the same reason. When using it, the users had to remove the outer iron shell.

    Comrades from the Technical Section of the Shanghai Mechanical and Electrical Product Design Company also talked to me about similar situations. For example, a Soviet-style green fodder cutter, which some iron factories in Shanghai are currently producing, is used in large Soviet livestock farms. Therefore, the original design is larger, weighing more than 700 kilograms, and needs to be transported by car. However, there are not many large livestock farms in our country, and most of the green fodder cutters produced in Shanghai are supplied to some small-scale livestock units in China. This machine seems too bulky and wasteful. Not long ago, the company's designers discovered another lightweight green fodder cutter at an exhibition, weighing less than 100 kilograms, and it can be carried by two people. Its output is half less than the Soviet style. This kind of cutter is more suitable for China's current needs, but it has not been produced.

    Similar examples have been found in many machine factories in Shanghai. Some factories have made reasonable improvements, saving raw materials and improving efficiency. Some factories have not yet changed.

    After checking out these problems, some comrades in the factory asked in surprise: Soviet industrial technology is the most advanced, and their products must be the most reasonable. Why do problems still occur? Why is it necessary to improve its original design? This question can be discussed from two aspects.

    It can be seen from the above two examples that the occurrence of the problem is not mainly due to any shortcomings in the Soviet-style products themselves. The vast majority of Soviet-style products are advanced and superior, and these products are in line with the actual needs of the Soviet Union. The problem lies in the fact that our learning methods are not correct, and we have forgotten to combine these advanced technologies with the actual situation in China and even in our own factory. This is the main aspect of the problem. For example, the natural conditions in the Soviet Union are very different from those in our country. The Soviet Union is located in the cold zone, and the design of industrial products must take this climate condition into consideration. However, our country is located in the temperate and subtropical zones, and there is no need to prevent cold like the Soviet Union. However, some electrical machinery factories in Shanghai are still producing some mechanical and electrical products according to the lowest temperature requirements in Siberia. The social conditions in the Soviet Union are also somewhat different from those in our country. For example, the Soviet Union has fewer laborers than our country, and the expenditure on labor wages is large. Therefore, in product design, they must strive for a high degree of automation and minimize labor costs. However, our country has a large number of laborers and a shortage of industrial raw materials. Therefore, we must strive to save raw materials and not necessarily pursue production automation too early at excessive cost. When learning and imitating Soviet industrial products, we must not only fully absorb the advantages of Soviet products, but also carefully consider the actual conditions in our country at the same time. However, some enterprises often forget this point.

    Of course, there is also another situation, that is, the drawings of some Soviet products do have some shortcomings, which we need to improve in production. This is not surprising. Soviet industrial technology is advanced, but technological advancement is not absolute or fixed. Some process technologies may also contain some imperfections, which need to be continuously discovered and improved in practice to make them more perfect. The Soviet Union had raised the shortcomings existing in industrial production at the 20th Party Congress and called on the entire party to improve them.

    Someone asked again: Then, how can we modify the shortcomings in these product designs that have already been discovered? Regarding this point, many comrades have a common opinion: The discovered shortcomings must be corrected, but it must be done cautiously and carefully, and strictly in accordance with the prescribed application system for modifying product designs, and should not be acted rashly.

    Here is an example to illustrate. Shanghai Public-Private Joint-Venture Jiuxin Electrical Machinery Factory received a task last year to produce more than 400 Soviet model grinding machines. When engineer Xie Zude read the drawings of this grinding machine, he found that the four-horsepower, four-pole motor designed above could be changed to a four-horsepower, two-pole motor. As long as the pulley is adjusted, the transmission efficiency will not be affected, and a lot of materials can be saved. More than three tons of single-釸 steel sheets can be saved alone. After discovering this problem, engineer Xie, starting from the specific production conditions of his factory and the actual situation of steel shortage, did not immediately start doing it, but continued to look for relevant technical materials for careful research, and asked for instructions from the leadership. Finally, it was proved theoretically and approved by the higher authorities, and he modified the design, saving the country a lot of valuable steel. Engineer Xie Zude's approach should be considered correct.

    Some comrades in other factories are also worried: Will this affect our work of learning advanced Soviet technology? After all, many Soviet heavy industrial products are the world's leading technology today! Yes, Soviet industrial technology is the most advanced in the world today. However, making local modifications to a few drawings according to actual needs does not mean anything else, but only means that we are making progress in learning Soviet technology. As long as we continue to not relax ideological education for enterprise employees, this will never affect the work of learning Soviet technology. In recent years, in many of our enterprises, the idea of ​​modestly learning advanced Soviet technology has been established. What is worth noting now is: a lazy thinking and a dogmatic tendency have grown in some people. They do not seriously study the situation of the locality or the enterprise, do not summarize their own experience, and do not transform foreign technology into their own wealth through these tasks. "Anyway, it's a Soviet drawing, it must be right, just do it as it is." This kind of blindness needs to be corrected.

    Learning advanced Soviet technology, now and in the future, will always be our firm and unwavering policy. Especially now, honestly learning is the most important aspect. Various Soviet technical drawings have always been good textbooks for our technical learning. But similarly, we must always adhere to the learning method that combines with reality. We have always believed that effective learning is not completely "blind imitation". For Soviet product drawings, we must not only modestly learn the advantages of these drawings, but also conduct in-depth and detailed research on our own actual conditions and tightly integrate them together. Speaking of which, these are not new principles, but they are not so easy to implement in actual work. Of course, we still have to do it this way.

    有效的学习并不是“依葫芦画瓢”
    本报记者　季音
    最近，在工厂里了解增产节约运动情况，和一些同志漫谈了关于修改产品设计中所碰到的一个问题，即如何正确地对待苏联的工业产品图纸。这个问题有一定的普遍性，现在就把它写在这里。
    上海的一些机电工厂，近年来在苏联的无私援助下，获得了许多宝贵的技术资料，其中包括各种产品的图纸。这些产品图纸是苏联人民长期创造性劳动的成果、它具体而鲜明地体现着社会主义制度的优越性。上海的不少工厂近年来就按照着这些图纸，生产了各种新型的机电产品，这就丰富了这些厂的生产内容，大大改变了这些厂生产上的落后面貌。
    上海一些工厂在最近的增产节约运动中，普遍展开了改进产品设计的活动，也检查了学习苏联产品图纸的工作。在检查中，他们发现过去在学习苏联产品图纸中，在少数产品上，表现了不从实际出发，生搬硬套的主观主义作法，结果就造成了许多浪费，使这些产品用起来很不方便。国营上海精密医疗器械厂曾按照苏联图纸生产了不少新的医疗器械，这些器械大部分都很好，但有的产品，他们在仿制中没有结合中国的具体情况，就造得不好。例如他们生产的一种X光机上的卧床，就完全按照原设计生产，而没有考虑到苏联人的身材一般的都比较高大，而中国人的身材较小，结果床身造得又高又大，既浪费钢材，使用又不方便。身材较矮的医生在检查病人时，要站在小凳子上才能工作。又如他们生产的X光机的脚踏开关，也因同样的原因，造得太大了，使用单位在使用的时候，不得不把外边的铁壳子拆去。
    上海机电产品设计公司技术科的同志，也和我谈到类似的情形。例如，上海目前一些铁工厂正在生产的一种苏式的青饲料切割机，这是苏联大型畜牧场里用的，因此原设计就大一些，重量有七百多公斤，需要用汽车来拖运。但是我国大型畜牧场不多，上海生产的青饲料切割机大多供应国内一些规模不大的畜牧单位，这部机器就显得太笨重，也太浪费了。不久前，公司设计人员曾在一个展览会上发现了另一种轻型青饲料切割机，重量不到一百公斤，用两个人抬着就可以搬运，它的产量要比苏式的少一半。这种切割机就比较适合中国目前的需要，但是却没有生产。
    类似的例子，上海不少机器工厂里都有发现。有的厂已作了合理的改进，节约了原材料，提高了使用效率。有的厂则还没有改。
    在检查出了这些问题以后，工厂里有些同志诧异地问道：苏联的工业技术是最先进的，他们的产品也一定是最合理的，为什么还会发生问题？为什么还要改进它的原设计？这个问题，可以从两方面来说。
    从上述这两个例子中可以看出，问题的发生，主要的并不是苏式产品的本身有什么缺点。苏式产品绝大多数是先进的，优越的，这些产品都是与苏联的实际需要相吻合的。问题是发生在我们的学习方法上不对头，忘掉了把这些先进技术与中国的以至本厂的实际情况相结合，这是发生问题的主要方面。比如，苏联的自然条件和我国有很大的不同，苏联地处寒带，工业产品设计中就必然要考虑到这个气候条件，但我国地处温带和亚热带，就不需要像苏联那样的来防寒。而上海有些电机厂却还是按照西伯利亚最低温度的要求在生产一些机电产品。苏联的社会条件也与我国有若干的不同，比如，苏联的劳动力比我国少，劳动工资的支出大；因此他们在产品设计中就必然力求高度的自动化，尽量少耗费劳动力。而我国则是劳动力众多，而工业原料缺乏，因此我们就要力求原材料的节约，而不一定以过多的代价来过早追求生产的自动化。在学习和仿制联苏工业品的时候，我们既要充分地吸收苏联产品的优点，又不能不同时周密地考虑我国的实际条件。而有的企业则常常把这一点忘掉了。
    当然，也有另一方面的情形，即有些苏联产品的图纸确实有一些缺点，需要我们在生产中予以改进。这也是毫不为怪的。苏联的工业技术是先进的，但是，技术先进不是绝对的、固定不变的东西，有的工艺技术也会包含一些不够完备的地方，需要在实践中不断地来发现和改进，使之更加完善。苏联在二十次党代表大会中就曾经提出过工业生产中所存在的缺点，号召全党来加以改进。
    有人又问道：那末，我们怎样来修改已经发现了的这些产品设计上的缺点呢？对于这一点，许多同志都有共同的意见：已经发现的缺点一定要动手改正，但是必须慎重、仔细，并且严格地按照规定的修改产品设计的请示制度来执行，而不应当轻举妄动。
    这里不妨举一个例子来说一说。上海公私合营久新电机厂，在去年接到了生产四百多台苏联型号砂轮机的任务，工程师谢祖德在翻阅这种砂轮机的图纸时，发现上边设计的四匹四极马达可以改小为四匹两极马达，只要调整一下皮带盘，传动效率不受影响，而材料可以节省很多，单釸钢片就可以省三吨多。谢工程师从本厂的具体生产条件和钢材缺乏的实际情况出发，发现了这个问题以后，他没有立即动手来做，而是继续寻找有关技术资料进行审慎的研究，并且请示领导。最后从理论上得到证明，也得到上级的批准，便修改了设计，为国家省下了许多宝贵的钢材。像谢祖德工程师这样的做法，应当认为是正确的。
    还有些厂里的同志耽心：我们这样做了，会不会影响到我们学习苏联先进技术的工作呢？苏联的许多重工业产品毕竟是今天世界上第一流的技术呀！是的，苏联工业技术在今天世界上是最先进的。但我们根据实际需要将少数图纸作局部的修改，这绝不意味着别的，而只是意味着我们在学习苏联技术上的进步。只要继续不放松对企业工作人员的思想教育，这决不会影响到学习苏联技术的工作。这几年来，在我们的许多企业里，虚心学习苏联先进技术的思想是树立起来了，现在值得注意的：在一部分人中滋长了一种懒惰思想和教条主义倾向，他们不认真研究本地、本企业的情况，不总结自己的经验，不通过这些工作把外来技术变成为自己的财富，“反正是苏联的图纸，准没错，照样做就行了，”这种盲目性倒是需要加以纠正的。
    学习苏联的先进技术，现在以至将来，永远是我们坚定不移的方针。特别是现在，老老实实地学习是最主要的方面。苏联的各种技术图纸始终是我们技术学习的好课本。但同样地，我们也必须始终坚持与实际相结合的学习方法。我们从来都认为，有效的学习并不完全是“依葫芦画瓢”。对苏联的产品图纸，我们既要虚心地学习这些图纸的优点，又要深入细致地研究自己的实际条件，把它们紧紧地揉合在一起。说起来，这些都不是什么新鲜道理了，但是在实际工作中执行起来，却不是那么容易的。当然，我们还是必须这样去做。
