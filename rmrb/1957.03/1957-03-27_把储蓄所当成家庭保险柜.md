　　Treating Savings Offices as Family Safes
　　Yuán Xīn
　　I have been saving in the bank since liberation. Initially, I would deposit the money I needed for the second half of the month and withdraw it in the middle of the month. I deposited and withdrew once a month. Later, when a savings office was established near my home, it became very convenient to deposit and withdraw, so I deposited all of my and my spouse's salaries, except for the money that needed to be paid immediately (such as government bonds, union dues, childcare fees, monthly bus passes, meal tickets, and a week's worth of cooking oil, salt, soy sauce, etc.). I withdrew petty cash every seven or eight days. Other expenses, such as nanny fees, rent, water and electricity bills, and buying coal briquettes, were withdrawn as needed. Whenever I received additional salary, bonuses, or coal allowance, I would immediately deposit any money that would not be spent within two or three days. In short, I treated the savings office as a family safe, and I always kept only two yuan or less in cash in my pocket. This has helped me a lot. First of all, life has become planned. In the past two years, life has improved day by day, not only completely eliminating the phenomenon of living beyond my means and being well-off in the first half of the month but struggling in the second half, but also being able to solve temporary expenses such as my own dental treatment, dentures, family medical expenses, and my spouse's maternity expenses by saving and accumulating on a monthly basis. I have never requested subsidies or advances. Because life is stable, the work enthusiasm of me and my spouse has naturally been improved.
    Another relatively large gain is the cultivation of my child's saving habits and frugal lifestyle. I often ran to the savings office, and my ten-year-old child curiously asked, "Why?" I explained the meaning of patriotic savings to him little by little, which aroused his interest, and he clamored to save too. From March 1956, he also opened an account at the bank. To encourage him, I decided that every time he saved 50 cents, I would add another 50 cents to deposit. Buying shoes, socks, children's books, and subscribing to newspapers are all paid for with his own savings. Since then, pencils have never been lost again, pocket money has basically not been spent, and two jiao given on Sundays to play in the park are all saved except for buying tickets. When shoes and socks are torn, they are mended and mended again, and he even asks to wear them for another month. He truly achieved "don't buy what you can buy or not buy, delay buying what you can delay." Now, he has become a fixed small depositor who goes in and out of the savings office once or twice a month.

### 把储蓄所当成家庭保险柜

　　把储蓄所当成家庭保险柜
　　袁心
    我打从一解放就在银行储蓄。最初是每月把下半月要用的钱存起来，到月中再取。每月存一次，取一次。后来我家附近成立了储蓄所，存取很方便，我就把自己和爱人的工资除去应该立即付出的钱（如公债、工会会费、托儿费、汽车月票、饭票和一个星期的油盐酱菜等）以外，全部存进去。每隔七、八天取一次零用。其它如保姆费、房租、水电、买煤球等等，都是到日子现取。领到追加工资、奖金，或煤火费，只要是三两天以内不花的钱，也必立刻存进去。总而言之，我是拿储蓄所当了家庭保险柜，自己腰包里老是只有两元以下的现钞。这样做，对我帮助很大。首先生活走上了计划的轨道。近两年生活日益改善，不仅根本消除了寅吃卯粮，“上半月宽、下半月窘”的现象，而且连自己治牙、镶牙、家属医药费、爱人生育费等临时开支，也都能按月樽节积累而解决。从来没请求过补助或借支。因为生活安定，我和爱人的工作情绪自然也就得到提高。
    还有一个比较大的收获，就是培养了孩子的储蓄习惯和俭朴作风。我常常跑储蓄所，我的十岁的孩子好奇地问：“为什么？”我就把爱国储蓄的意义一点一点的说给他听，引起了他的兴趣，吵着也要储蓄。从1956年3月，他在银行也开了一户。为了鼓励他，我决定每逢他攒到五角钱时，就再给他添上五角存进去。买鞋袜、儿童读物、订报，完全由他自己储蓄的钱来支付。从此铅笔再也不丢了，零钱基本上不花了，星期日给两角钱到公园去玩，除买门票以外，都剩回来。鞋袜破了，补了再补，还要求多凑和穿一个月。真正做到了“可买可不买的不买，可以缓买的缓买”。现在，他已成为每月必定出入储蓄所一两次的固定小储户了。
