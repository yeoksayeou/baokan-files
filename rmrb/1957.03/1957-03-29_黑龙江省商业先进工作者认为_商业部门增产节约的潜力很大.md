　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin. The representative conference of advanced workers in the commercial system of Heilongjiang Province studied the issue of deeply developing the movement to increase production and practice economy.

　　The representatives all used their achievements and experience to prove that the commercial sector has great potential for increasing production and practicing economy. They analyzed the new situations and new characteristics in this year's commercial work and believed that to further develop the movement to increase production and practice economy, it is first necessary to actively expand sources of goods, improve service quality, and do a good job in market supply. For some commodities with insufficient sources, it is possible to increase market supply as long as more efforts are made to find sources of goods.

　　The representatives proposed that another important aspect of increasing production and practicing economy is to improve business management and reduce circulation costs. In the commodity transportation link alone, if 70% of the commodities in the counties along the river can use water transportation, it can save the state more than 600,000 yuan in transportation costs this year. There are also many wasteful phenomena in warehouse storage and commodity packaging that should be overcome. According to a survey, commodity losses due to poor commodity storage totaled more than 2 million yuan in the province last year. However, in some places, commodity losses have been greatly reduced due to the implementation of "small commodity packaging" and improved warehouse storage methods. According to calculations, if the department store, chemical industry, trade, and textile companies can reuse 60% of the packaging wooden boxes and cloth skins twice, they can save the state 2.2 million yuan in packaging costs, and at the same time save a lot of wood, iron nails, and cloth.

　　黑龙江省商业先进工作者认为
　　商业部门增产节约的潜力很大
    据新华社哈尔滨讯  黑龙江省商业系统召开的先进工作者代表会议，研究深入开展增产节约运动的问题。
    代表们都用自己的成绩和经验证明，商业部门增产节约的潜力是很大的。他们分析了今年商业工作中的新情况和新特点，认为要进一步开展增产节约运动，首先必须积极扩大货源，提高服务质量，做好市场供应。对于某些货源不足的商品，只要多想办法挖掘货源，也是能够增加市场供应的。
    代表们提出另一个增产节约的重要方面是改善经营管理，降低流转费用。单是在商品运输环节中，如果沿江各县能有70％的商品利用水运，今年就可以给国家节约六十多万元运费。在仓库保管和商品包装方面也有许多浪费现象应当克服。据调查，去年因为商品保管不良，全省商品损耗达二百多万元。可是有的地方由于推行“商品小包装”和改善仓库保管方法，商品损耗就大大降低。又据计算，如果百货、化工、贸易和纺织品公司能够把60％的包装木箱和布皮利用两次，就可以为国家节约二百二十万元包装费，同时还可以节省大量木材、铁钉和布。
