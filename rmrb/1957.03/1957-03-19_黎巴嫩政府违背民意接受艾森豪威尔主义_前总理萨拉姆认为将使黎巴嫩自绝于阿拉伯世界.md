Xinhua News Agency Report: Talks between U.S. President's Special Envoy Richards and the Lebanese government to "explain" the "Eisenhower Doctrine" concluded on the 16th.

On the same day, both sides issued a joint communique stating that the United States will provide Lebanon with economic and military "aid" in accordance with the "Eisenhower Doctrine." The Lebanese government welcomes the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and the two governments will "immediately take legal and technical steps to implement this doctrine."

Richards arrived in Beirut on the 14th. He chose Lebanon as the first country in the Middle East to peddle the "Eisenhower Doctrine." During Richards' stay, Lebanese newspapers launched fierce attacks on his visit.

"Al Siyasa" published an open letter to Richards, which stated: "Your political mission has aroused our suspicion, vigilance, and even resentment. The Eisenhower Doctrine conflicts with the sovereignty of Arab countries and their national interests." The newspaper also pointed out: There is no "communist threat" to Arab countries now, nor will there be in the future. On the contrary, these countries are threatened by imperialism and Israel.

Xinhua News Agency, March 18th dispatch from Beirut: Former Lebanese Prime Minister Saeb Salam issued a statement to the press on the 17th, criticizing the joint communique issued by Lebanon and the United States accepting the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

In his statement, Salam said that it was wrong for Lebanese officials to make decisions on Lebanon's foreign policy without consulting public opinion and other Arab countries. He said this step would isolate Lebanon in the Arab world.

    据新华社讯　美国总统特使理查兹向黎巴嫩政府“解释”“艾森豪威尔主义”的会谈已经在16日结束。
    同一天，双方发表联合公报说，美国将根据“艾森豪威尔主义”给黎巴嫩经济和军事“援助”。黎巴嫩政府欢迎“艾森豪威尔主义”，两国政府将“立即采取法律的和技术的步骤来实行这个主义”。
    理查兹是在14日到达贝鲁特的。他选择黎巴嫩作为他到中东各国去兜售“艾森豪威尔主义”的第一个国家。在理查兹逗留期间，黎巴嫩报纸对他的访问予以猛烈抨击。
    “政治报”发表了一封给理查兹的公开信，其中说：“你的政治使命引起了我们的怀疑，警惕，甚至愤恨。艾森豪威尔主义是同阿拉伯国家的主权和它们的民族利益相冲突的。这家报纸并且指出：现在不存在、将来也会不存在对阿拉伯国家的“共产主义威胁”。相反地，这些国家受到帝国主义和以色列的威胁。
    新华社18日讯　贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩前总理赛布·萨拉姆17日向报界发表一项声明，批评黎巴嫩同美国发表的接受“艾森豪威尔主义”的联合公报。
    萨拉姆在声明中说，黎巴嫩官员们在决定黎巴嫩的外交政策时不同舆论和阿拉伯其他国家商量的做法是错误的。他说这个步骤将使黎巴嫩在阿拉伯世界中陷于孤立。
