Rejoicing in the Achievements of Our Country's Peaceful Diplomacy
    Li Pingheng Hopes That Former Diplomats Abroad Will Return to the Motherland

Premier Zhou Enlai's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries is a landmark record in the history of our country's diplomacy, fully demonstrating the significant role that New China's peaceful diplomacy plays in international political life. I express my great excitement and heartfelt support. Premier Zhou, in less than eighty days, traveled ten thousand miles, visited eleven countries, and was warmly welcomed by the people of those countries everywhere. The governments of those countries received our great envoy of peace with very solemn etiquette and a cordial attitude. During the visits, Premier Zhou, on behalf of our country, issued joint communiqués or joint statements with the leaders of various governments. This has played a huge role in strengthening the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, safeguarding world peace and the cause of socialist construction, promoting friendly cooperation among Asian countries, consolidating national independence and the anti-colonialist struggle, thereby further easing the international situation. This unprecedented achievement is a manifestation of the power of the 600 million people of our country united as one, and it is also a concrete manifestation of Premier Zhou's keen understanding of the international situation, his skillful use of diplomatic talents, and his resolute implementation of our country's peaceful diplomatic policy. As someone who engaged in diplomatic work in the old China, comparing the past and the present, I have a deeper understanding and feel the loveliness of our great motherland even more! I lived abroad for a considerable period of time, and due to my position, I had many dealings with representatives of imperialist countries, and I also had many contacts with representatives of weak countries. In my work practice, I deeply realized the meaning of the phrase "weak countries have no diplomacy" in the era of power politics. Today, our country and our Premier are so respected by the governments and people of various countries, which is particularly exciting for those of us who have worked in the diplomatic circles of old China. I think that those who are still doing diplomatic work for Taiwan, as well as retired former diplomats, will feel the same way as I do. I am familiar with many of the people in the diplomatic circles of old China, and I have a good understanding of their past feelings. With the exception of a few, the vast majority of them are patriotic professional diplomats, many of whom have diplomatic talents and are eager to do something for the country. However, due to the corruption and incompetence of the government at that time, their good wishes could never be realized. Today, our motherland has truly achieved independence and has become a major country in the world. We are playing an increasingly important role in international affairs. All ethnic groups, classes, democratic parties, and people's organizations in the country are united as one, and the national economy and cultural and educational undertakings have been unprecedentedly developed. The people's lives have been improved, and are improving day by day. The poverty and backwardness of old China are gradually being eliminated. All upright and patriotic people will feel great joy and encouragement when they see these glorious achievements and tremendous changes. However, those former diplomats scattered abroad, due to being abroad for a long time, or due to being deceived by imperialist reactionary propaganda, do not understand the domestic situation, so that some have retired but still reside in foreign countries, and some are still serving Taiwan and have not returned to the embrace of the motherland, which is very regrettable. Perhaps some are concerned that there will be no suitable work after returning to the country. I believe that this concern is completely unnecessary. Today, we are engaged in an unprecedented construction undertaking, and all aspects need talent. The number of people employed each year is increasing by more than 1.5 million, and nearly 3 million people were employed last year alone. In the past few years, those who have returned from abroad, whether they are scientists, industrialists, business people, or military and political personnel, have been properly arranged. The policy of the People's Government is to unite all forces that can be united to strive for the construction of socialism. As long as they are willing to serve the people, there is no need to worry about not having suitable work. People with experience and knowledge in diplomacy are even more needed by the country. Perhaps some people do not understand the people's democratic system of the motherland very well, and are concerned that they will not be accustomed to living in the country after returning. In fact, people's democracy is essentially different from the so-called democracy of capitalist countries. The democracy of capitalist countries is a false democracy in which a few privileged classes oppress the broad masses of the people. Our people's democracy is a real democracy jointly enjoyed by the broad masses of the people. Now, under the encouragement of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," intellectuals across the country are marching towards science, and socialist democracy is developing and consolidating day by day. Today, Taiwan is occupied by the United States, and everything is under the control of the U.S. imperialists. The U.S. imperialists' attempt to create two Chinas and use Taiwan as a military base for aggression against China is well known. Serving Taiwan is actually serving U.S. imperialism, and Taiwan will always return to the embrace of the motherland. The current tragic situation of lingering on will not last long. I think that former diplomats abroad will not fail to understand this truth. It is not difficult to judge which is the bright path that should be taken. Even if one is already quite old and does not consider one's own future, one should make a choice as soon as possible for the sake of the next generation, return to the motherland, and jointly participate in the great cause of building the motherland.
    When I speak in this solemn venue, my heart is filled with thoughts of my old friends who have worked together overseas for many years. The ancients said: "Traveling to a foreign country is something that people of the past lamented." They are all over fifty or sixty years old, and have been living under the roof of others for a long time. Don't they have any thoughts of their homeland? Today, our international status has been unprecedentedly improved, and it is the right time for people doing diplomatic work to play a role. The motherland is undergoing a revival, and every one of the 600 million compatriots is responsible for the great cause of building the motherland. Patriotism makes us one family. When the time comes, one should make a decisive decision. I hope my old friends overseas will think again and again!

    为祖国和平外交的成就欢欣鼓舞
    李平衡希望在国外的旧外交界人士返回祖国
    周恩来总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一个国家的报告是我国外交史上划时代的纪录，充分说明新中国的和平外交在国际政治生活中所发挥的重大作用。我表示极大的兴奋和衷心的拥护。周总理以不到八十天的时间，行程十万里，访问了十一个国家，到处受到各国人民万人空巷的热烈欢迎，各国政府都以非常隆重的礼节和亲切态度接待了我国伟大的和平使者。在访问过程中，周总理代表我们国家分别与各国政府领导人发表了联合公报或联合声明，这对加强以苏联为首的社会主义国家的团结，保卫世界和平和社会主义建设事业，促进亚洲各国的友好合作，巩固各国民族独立和反殖民主义的斗争，都起了巨大的作用，从而使国际局势继续趋向缓和。这种空前的成就，是我国六亿人民团结一致的力量表现，也是周总理洞悉国际形势，善于运用外交才能，坚决执行我国和平外交政策的具体表现。我以一个在旧中国从事外交工作的人，今昔对比，更有深刻的体会，更觉得我们伟大祖国的可爱！我在国外住过相当长的时期，由于职务上的关系，我同帝国主义国家的代表打过不少交道，也和弱小国家的代表有过很多接触。在我的工作实践中我深刻体会到在强权政治时代“弱国无外交”这句话的含义。今天我们的国家和总理受到各国政府和人民的如此尊敬，对于我们曾在旧中国外交界工作过的人来说，特别感到兴奋。我想今天仍在为台湾方面做外交工作的，以及现已退休的前外交界人士，都会与我有同感的。旧中国外交界的人士，许多我都是熟识的，对他们过去的心情我是比较了解的。他们当中除少数人外，绝大多数都是爱国的职业外交官，其中有许多是有外交才干，并且很想为国家做点事情的人。但是由于当时的政府腐败无能，他们的良好愿望，始终不能实现。今天我们的祖国已经真正取得独立，已经成为世界上一个大国，在国际事务中我们越来越多地发挥着重要作用。国内各民族、各阶层、各民主党派、各人民团体团结一致，国民经济和文化教育事业得到空前的发展，人民生活已经有所改善，而且日在改善之中，旧中国贫困落后的状况正在逐步消除。凡是正直、爱国的人，看到这些光辉的成就和巨大的变化，都会感到莫大的欢欣和鼓舞。然而那些散居在国外的旧外交界人士，由于长期在外，或者由于受到帝国主义反动宣传的蒙蔽，不了解国内情况，以致有的虽已退休而仍客居异国，有的仍然为台湾服务，尚未回到祖国怀抱，这是十分可惜的。也许有人顾虑到回国以后没有适当工作。我以为这种顾虑是完全不必要的。今天我们正在从事空前的建设事业，各方面都需要人才，每年增加就业人数都在一百五十万以上，去年一年就业人数将近三百万。几年来自国外回来的，不问是科学家、工商业者或是军政人员，都得到了妥善的安排。人民政府的政策是团结一切可以团结的力量为建设社会主义而奋斗，只要愿意为人民服务，决不愁没有适当的工作，有经验有学识的外交方面的人，那就更是国家所需要的了。也许有人对祖国的人民民主制度不大了解，顾虑回国后生活不习惯，其实，人民民主比资本主义国家的所谓民主是有着本质上的不同的，资本主义国家的民主是少数特权阶级压迫广大人民群众的假民主，我们的人民民主是广大人民共同享受的真正民主，现在全国知识分子正在“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的鼓舞之下，向科学进军，社会主义民主正在日益发展和巩固之中。今天的台湾为美国所侵占，一切都在美帝国主义者控制之下。美帝国主义企图制造两个中国，利用台湾为侵略中国的军事基地的阴谋是尽人皆知的。为台湾服务实际上就是为美帝国主义服务，而且台湾总是要回到祖国怀抱，目前苟延残喘的悲惨局面决不会久长。我想现在在国外的旧外交界的人士对于这个道理是不会不明白的，那一条是应该走的光明道路也是不难判断的。纵然，自己已有相当的年岁，不考虑自己的前途，但为后一代着想，也应该及早作出抉择，回到祖国，共同参加建设祖国的伟大的事业。
    我在这个庄严的会场讲话的时候，我的心是怀念着在海外共事多年的老朋友们的，古人说：“远适异国，昔人所悲。”他们都是五六十岁以上的人了，长久寄人篱下，难道没有故国之思吗？今天我国际地位空前提高，做外交工作的人们，正好发挥作用。祖国百废俱兴，建设祖国的伟大事业，六亿同胞人人有责。爱国便是一家，当机应断立断。希望海外老朋友再三思之！
