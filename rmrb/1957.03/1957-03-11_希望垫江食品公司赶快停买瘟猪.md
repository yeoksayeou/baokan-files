    Hoping the Dianjiang Food Company will stop buying diseased pigs immediately
    Since the establishment of the Dianjiang County Food Company in Sichuan Province in 1956, a large number of cases of slaughtering and selling diseased pigs have occurred because they transferred the received quarantine personnel to do purchasing, bookkeeping, and escorting work. The Chengxi Township purchasing station slaughtered four diseased pigs in early June 1956, and from September 5th to 23rd, they slaughtered another twenty-five diseased pigs, the vast majority of which were sold as fresh meat on the market, and a small portion was made into preserved meat.
    The Xinmin District purchasing station slaughtered and sold a total of thirty-two diseased pigs from May to the end of October 1956. In order to deceive buyers, some of them cut off the red spots on the skin of the diseased pigs and sold them. The Chengguan purchasing station slaughtered and sold more than ninety diseased pigs on a single day during the Mid-Autumn Festival in 1956, and at least three thousand households bought this kind of meat. The spread of swine fever is even wider.
    The slaughterhouses and processing plants where the food company slaughters diseased and dead pigs are not disinfected in any way. The blood and filth of the diseased pigs are everywhere, and germs spread everywhere. The Taiping Township No. 1 Senior Agricultural Cooperative is close to the food company's slaughterhouse. From June to September 23, 1956 alone, there were seventy-two diseased and dead pigs, and more than forty were cured.
    Director Zhuo of the Chengxi Township No. 1 Senior Cooperative in Wudong District said: "The forty-six pigs that died in our cooperative were caused by the food company slaughtering and burying diseased pigs in the cooperative." The members were very dissatisfied and wanted them to pay compensation. The No. 2 Joint Branch No. 2 Cooperative in the township lost ten pigs, eight of which were eaten. When the township People's Committee investigated the responsibility, the members all said: "The diseased pigs bought by the food company are all slaughtered and sold, of course we can eat them too."
    The above facts are too numerous to mention. Many pigs in the food company's breeding farms are getting sick. To date, 20,000 pigs throughout the county have become ill and 6,000 have died. It is hoped that the relevant leading departments will stop it quickly!

    希望垫江食品公司赶快停买瘟猪
    四川省垫江县自1956年成立了食品公司，由于他们把接收的检疫人员调去搞收购、记账、押运等工作，大量杀、卖病猪的现象就发生了。澄溪乡收购站1956年6月初杀了四头病猪，9月5日至23日又杀病猪二十五头，其中绝大多数在市场上当鲜肉出售，少部分作了腊肉。
    新民区收购站1956年5月至10月底共杀、卖病猪三十二头，为欺骗买主，有的将病猪皮上的红斑割了出卖。城关收购站1956年中秋节一天杀卖九十多头病猪，至少有三千多家割了这种肉。猪瘟传布更广。
    食品公司宰杀病、死猪的屠场、加工厂不经过任何消毒，病猪的血和污物遍地都是，病菌到处传播。太平乡第一高级农业社接近食品公司屠场，仅1956年6月至9月23日，即有病、死猪七十二头，治好四十余头。
    五洞区澄溪乡第一高级社卓主任说：“我们死的四十六头猪，是食品公司在社里宰杀瘟猪和埋瘟猪惹起的。”社员们很不满意，要他们赔。该乡二联二分社死猪十头，剥食八头，乡人民委员会追究责任，社员都说：“食品公司买的病猪都杀来卖得，我们当然也吃得。”
    以上事实，不胜枚举。食品公司各饲养场的猪发病很多。至今全县猪发病已达二万头，死亡六千头。希望有关领导部门赶快制止！
