Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd. Two "body measurement teams" organized by the China Knitwear and Cotton Goods Company's Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station departed yesterday for the Central South and Southwest regions to measure people's body sizes.

    In the past, cotton sweaters, undershirts and other knitted garments produced in Shanghai were mostly made according to the body size standards of people in the North. Generally speaking, the same specifications were not very suitable for people in the South and Southwest, because their bodies were shorter than those in the North. This was both uncomfortable for consumers to wear and a waste of raw materials.

    In order to be both popular with consumers and avoid wasting raw materials, this station has conducted a great deal of painstaking research. They first measured the body sizes of more than 600 men and more than 100 women in Shanghai, and then expanded the specifications of cotton sweaters and undershirts from the original six to eighteen, and successfully made eighteen new samples.

    Now, these two body measurement teams are carrying fifty dozen samples of various new specifications, ready to sell them while measuring after arriving at their destinations, to see if these new specifications of underwear are suitable for people's needs. At the same time, they will widely solicit consumers' opinions for improvement.

    身材测量队
    新华社上海2日电  中国针棉织品公司上海采购供应站组织的两个“身材测量队”，昨天出发到中南和西南两个地区去测量人们的身材。
    过去上海出品的棉毛衫、汗衫等针织衣服，大都是照北方人的身材作标准。在同一种规格中，一般说来，对南方人和西南人就不很适合；因为他们的身材较北方要矮些。这样，消费者穿上既不舒服，也浪费原料。
    为了做到既受消费者的欢迎，又不浪费原料，这个站曾进行了一番苦心研究。他们先在上海测量了六百多个男人和一百多个女人的身材，然后把棉毛衫、汗衫的规格，从原来的六种扩大到十八种，做成功十八种新的样品。
    现在，这两个身材测量队随身带有五十打各种新规格的样品，准备到达目的地以后，边测量边销售，看看这些新规格的内衣是否适合人们需要，同时将广泛吸收消费者意见，以便改进。
