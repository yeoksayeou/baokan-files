Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 22nd: The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, at its recent enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee, studied the issues of improving leadership style, strengthening grassroots work, and enhancing the ideological and political level and professional competence of leading cadres. The meeting determined that one Provincial Party Secretary, twenty-eight department and bureau chiefs from provincial-level organizations, and thirty-three section and division-level Party member cadres from provincial-level organizations will be transferred to county Party committees, agricultural cooperatives, ranches, factories, and grassroots enterprises and institutions to serve as Party secretaries, deputy secretaries, top or deputy administrative leaders, and resident cadres in cooperatives, etc., for approximately one year, before returning to their original positions. The meeting also decided to establish this method of taking turns to serve as grassroots leaders and earnestly exploring experiences as a permanent system.

The Provincial Party Committee requires that the transferred cadres generally arrive at their new posts by the end of March. They are required to focus on doing three things: first, in addition to being under the leadership of the local Party committee, they should also maintain direct contact with the Provincial Party Committee and promptly report situations; second, they should personally engage and study the specific experiences of these grassroots tasks; third, they should assist the original leading cadres in improving their leadership level and professional competence, and enhance their own ideological and political level and professional competence in practice. The Provincial Party Committee requires the transferred cadres to have a humble and patient spirit, to be students first and then teachers, and to learn from the grassroots comrades' hardworking and simple, and deeply rooted in the masses work style. However, they should not bring extravagance, waste, and bureaucracy with them.

In order to gain diverse experiences from various types of regions and units, the meeting, after research and deliberation, determined the following as bases for the transferred cadres: in rural areas, arid regions (Gaolan and Huining Counties); arid regions that are also ethnic minority areas (Dongxiang and Haiyuan Counties); mountainous regions that are also multi-economic areas (Huixian and Minxian Counties); cotton-growing regions that also focus on wind prevention, sand control, and water conservancy (Jinta and Anxi Counties); plateau regions (Ningxian County); regions with large populations but little land, many sideline occupations, and significant soil and water conservation tasks (Gangu County); mountainous regions that are also old revolutionary base areas (Huachi County); pastoral areas (Tianzhu County), totaling fourteen counties. In the industrial and transportation sectors, five factories, one handicraft production cooperative, three construction companies, two transportation companies, and one municipal postal and telecommunications bureau, totaling twelve units, were selected; in the finance and trade sectors, one county supply and marketing cooperative, one county finance section, one county bank, one specialized company, one secondary wholesale station, and one county grain section, totaling six units, were selected. Among the transferred cadres are Li Jinglin, Secretary of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, He Chenghua, Minister of Industry, Lu Weigong, Secretary-General of the Gansu Provincial People's Committee, and Shi Xianzhi, Director of the Department of Commerce, etc.

　　改进领导作风，提高干部水平
　　甘肃省抽调干部到基层工作
    据新华社兰州22日电　中共甘肃省委在最近召开的常委扩大会议上，研究了改进领导作风、加强基层工作和提高领导干部思想政治水平与业务能力的问题。会议确定：抽调一个省委书记、二十八个省级机关厅、部长，三十三个省级机关科、处长级党员干部，到县委、农业社、牧场、工厂、基层事业企业单位担任党的书记、副书记，行政上的正职或副职，以及驻社干部等，工作一年左右，然后再回原职。会议并决定将这种轮流下去担任基层领导，切实摸索经验的方法，作为一种制度坚持下去。
    省委要求下去的干部一般地要在3月底到达新的工作岗位。要求着重做好三件事：一、除受当地党委领导外，并且直线与省委取得联系，及时反映情况；二、亲自动手，研究这些基层工作的具体经验；三、帮助原来的领导干部提高领导水平和业务能力，并且在实践中提高自己的思想政治水平与业务能力。省委要求下去的干部要有虚怀若谷、循循善诱的精神，先作学生，后作先生，学习下边同志艰苦朴素、深入群众的作风。但不要把铺张浪费与官僚主义带下去。
    为了从各方面各不同类型的地区、单位取得各种不同的经验，会议经过研究后确定：在农村选定干旱地区（皋兰、会宁县）；干旱又是少数民族地区（东乡、海原县）；山区又是多种经济地区（徽县、岷县）；植棉又是防风砂、修水利地区（金塔、安西县）；高原地区（宁县）；人多地少、副业多、水土保持任务大的地区（甘谷县）；山区又是老根据地（华池县）；牧业区（天祝县）等共计十四个县。在工业交通部门选择了五个工厂，一个手工业生产联合社，三个建筑公司，两个运输公司，一个市邮电局，共十二个单位；在财贸部门选择了一个县供销社，一个县财政科，一个县银行，一个专业公司，一个二级批发站，一个县粮食科，共计六个单位，作为下放干部的据点。下去的干部中有中共甘肃省委书记李景林，工业部长何承华，省人民委员会秘书长陆为公，商业厅长石现之等。
