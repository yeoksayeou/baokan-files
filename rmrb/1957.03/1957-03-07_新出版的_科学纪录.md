    Newly Published "Science Record"
    The first issue of the first volume of the journal "Science Record," edited by the Compilation and Publication Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has been published by Science Press in both Chinese and foreign language versions. Published in this journal are short articles on the important new achievements of Chinese scientists in the fields of mathematics, natural sciences, and technical sciences, as well as previously unpublished scientific research results that elaborate on theories or methods.
    This issue contains fifteen scientific papers. In mathematics, there is "On Exponential Sums" by mathematician Hua Luogeng. In 1940, the author obtained results on the estimation of trigonometric sums, which has become an indispensable tool in number theory research. The author has recently further improved the 1940 results, making them more precise. There is also "Using Entire Functions of Order ρ to Uniformly Approximate Functions on Jordan Regions of Index ρ" by mathematician Chen Jiangong. He proposes that if the complement Κ of a continuous point set Κ on the plane of complex numbers contains a semi-infinite straight line, then Κ has an index; the author gives a clear definition of this index that has not been proposed before. The author points out that if an analytic function on Κ with index ρ can be uniformly approximated by entire functions of order ρ under appropriate conditions. Also included are papers by mathematician Liao Shantao, who recently returned from the United States: "Periodic Transformations and Fixed Point Theorem I. Upper Product and Singular Cohomology" and "Periodic Transformations and Fixed Point Theorem II. Manifold." These are the results of his research during his time abroad and have received high praise from the mathematical community at home and abroad. In addition, there are creative papers by mathematicians Zhuang Qitai, Wu Guanglei, and some young mathematicians.
    In physics, there is an article by physicist Lu Xueshan et al., "Systematic Changes in Crystal Structure in Single-Phase Regions—Extraordinary Phenomena Observed in the Al-Cu-Ni Ternary System." In X-ray studies of the phase equilibrium relationship of the aluminum, copper, and nickel ternary alloy system, the authors found eight very interesting and rare different structural types in the single-phase region, which provides new experimental data for studying the composition rules of alloys.
    In chemistry, there are two papers by chemist Ji Yufeng et al. The first is on "Research on Thiazoles." The second is on "Research on Pyrimidines." Based on the metabolic process of organisms, the authors studied the reaction between peroxides and some alkylthio pyrimidines, which are often present in animal bodies. At the same time, they corrected the previous research on the reaction course in this area and proved it through experiments.
    In biology, there is "Adaptive Formation of Nitrate Reductase in Rice Seedlings" by biologist Tang Peisong et al. In the process of studying the respiration of rice, the authors observed that when starved seedlings are supplied with various respiratory substrates, there is an "induction period" before the respiration rate increases. The authors presented evidence from experiments, arguing that this is because "adaptive enzymes" may be formed in higher plants.
    In geology, "Preliminary Study on ‘Ice-Sliding Action’ near Huangshan, Harbin, and Zhalainuoer, Inner Mongolia" by paleontologist Pei Wenzhong will arouse widespread interest and attention in the geological community. This is the first time the author has discovered deposits generated by Quaternary ice-sliding action in the Northeast region. Ice-sliding action and glacial phenomena are similar in nature, but the climatic conditions of the two are different. The former indicates a phenomenon of gradual warming. Whether there have been glaciers in China, especially in the South, is still a controversial issue in the geological community today. Therefore, the discovery of ice-sliding action in the Northeast will be of great help in solving the glacier problem in China.
    In technical science, there is an article by Qian Xuesen, a specialist in mechanics, entitled "On Large-Scale Wind Power Plants." The author proposes how to solve the contradiction between the low speed of the wind turbine and the high requirement for wind energy utilization in large-scale wind power plants. Based on the main fact that places with high wind power are also places where wind direction changes little, the author proposes a new design called "wind tunnel windmill" that installs a fixed device that does not need to turn, using jet sleeves to strengthen the wind speed in the wind tunnel, and installing the windmill in the place with the highest wind speed in the wind tunnel. The author theoretically deduces and calculates this design, proving that the power coefficient of this windmill is many times greater than that of ordinary windmills. The author also gives a specific example for calculation, calculating that the power coefficient of this wind tunnel windmill will be twenty-seven and a half times greater than that of ordinary windmills.

    新出版的“科学纪录”
    中国科学院编译出版委员会编辑的期刊“科学记录”新辑第一卷第一期已经由科学出版社同时分中文、外文两种版本出版。发表在这个刊物上的，都是我国科学家在数学、自然科学、技术科学等领域中重要研究的新成就的短文和阐述理论方面或方法方面未经公布的科学究研成果。
    在这一期中，刊登了十五篇科学论文。在数学方面，有数学家华罗庚的“关于指数和”。作者在1940年曾获得关于三角和估值研究的结果，这个结果在数论研究中已成为不可缺少的工具；作者最近又将1940年的结果作了更进一步的改进，使之更加精密。还有数学家陈建功的“用ρ级的整函数来匀迫于指示数ρ的若当区域上的函数”，他提出在复数?的平面上的连续点集Κ的余集Κ中，若含有半根直线，则Κ就是具有指示数；作者给予此种指示数以前人没有提出过的明确的定义，作者指出若指示数为ρ的Κ上的解析函数，在适当的条件下可用ρ级的整函数来均匀迫近。还有不久以前从美国归国的数学家廖山涛的论文：“周期变换与不动点定理Ⅰ．上积与特异上同调”和“周期变换与不动点定理Ⅱ．流形”，这是他在国外时期研究的成果，曾获得国内外数学界很高的评价。此外，还有数学家庄圻泰、吴光磊以及一些青年数学工作者的创造性的论文。
    在物理学方面，有物理学家陆学善等的“单相区内晶体结构的系统变迁——Al-Cu-Ni三元系中所观察到的非常现象”一文。作者在铝、铜、镍三元合金系相平衡关系的X射线的研究中，在单相区内发现非常有趣的、稀有的八种不同的结构型式，这对研究合金的组成规律提供了新的实验数据。
    在化学方面，刊有化学家纪育沣等所著的两篇论文。第一篇是关于“噻唑的研究”。第二篇是关于
  “嘧啶的研究”，作者根据生物的代谢过程，研究了动物体内经常存在过氧化合物和一些烷硫基嘧啶接触进行的反应作用，同时对前人在这方面的反应历程的研究作了更正，并由实验予以证明。
    在生物学方面，有生物学家汤佩松等著的“水稻幼苗中硝酸还原酶的适应形成”。作者在研究水稻的呼吸的过程中观察到，当饥饿的幼苗被供给各种呼吸基质时，在呼吸速度加强前有一个“诱导期”，作者从实验中提出了证据，认为这是由于在高等植物体中可能形成“适应酶”的缘故。
    在地质学方面，古生物学家裴文中的“哈尔滨黄山及内蒙札赉诺尔附近‘冰滑作用’的初步研究”，将引起地质学界广泛的兴趣和注意。这是作者第一次在东北地区发现的因第四纪冰滑作用所生成的堆积。冰滑作用和冰川现象在性质上有近似之处，但两者的气候条件却有不同，前者是表示气候渐向温暖转变而产生的现象。我国特别是南方，是否有过冰川，到今天还是地质学界争论的一个问题。因此在东北所发现的冰滑作用，对解决我国的冰川问题将有重大的帮助。
    在技术科学方面，刊有力学家钱学森的“关于大型风力发电站”一文。作者提出如何解决目前大型风力发电站中普遍存在风车转速低和风能利用率要求高之间的矛盾。作者根据风力大的地方正是风向改变小的地方这一主要事实，提出装置固定、不必转向，利用喷射套管加强风洞里的风速，把风车装在风洞里风速最大的地方，名叫“风洞风车”的新设计。作者在理论上对这项设计作了演绎和计算，证明这种风车比普通风车的功率系数可大很多倍。作者还举一个具体例子作了演算，计算出这种风洞风车将比普通风车的功率系数大二十七倍半。　　（子吴）
