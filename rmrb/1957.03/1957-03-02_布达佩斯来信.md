    Letter from Budapest
    Hungarian Journalist, Fèi Fǎbǐyáng
    A little over two months ago, I left China's beautiful land. It has been more than two months since I parted with my dear Chinese friends at the small border station of Manzhouli. I feel that an eternal friendship has tied me to my Chinese friends, and their words "Write from Budapest" as they watched the departing train still seem to echo in my ears. Because I often hear these words, I can already understand this Chinese phrase. In Guangzhou and Wuhan, Beijing and Harbin, my friends all said goodbye to me in this way, and everyone asked me to write to them about the situation in Budapest and Hungary.
    Of course, I could have written this letter earlier. However, when one must write about painful things, he always puts aside the already written letter again and again, because he is unwilling to sadden the people he loves so much with bad news. I was in this mood for those few weeks.
    What could I have written then?
    In the two months after October 23rd, counter-revolutionaries used force and armed terror to force most factory workers to strike. This was a strange strike. This strike was against the government of workers and peasants, and the government continued to pay the workers' wages as usual throughout the strike. This strike was unprecedented in history. This strange strike came at a high price—a loss of 14 billion forints, equivalent to 15% of the national income. As a result, in those weeks, the terror of inflation seriously threatened the people.
    The coal mines in December produced only one-third of the coal needed. This deepened the severity of the situation. At this time, the workers had already begun to understand that continuing the strike would lead to a great disaster. Because the lack of power hindered production. If you consider that 65% of the national income comes from industry, then it immediately becomes clear what a lack of power means.
    What else could I have written about our beautiful capital at that time? Budapest, known as the "Beautiful Queen of the Blue Danube," was more like a disreputable, down-on-her-luck, and ragged old beggar woman in those days than a dazzling queen. Many destroyed houses, broken glass, paralyzed traffic, empty streets at night, dim street lights and rubble, garbage everywhere…
    We greeted the New Year with great pain and hearts full of sorrow. Dear comrades, if I had written to you at that time, I would have greatly disappointed you.
    However, the situation at that time was not without hope after all. We quickly became convinced that we were not alone in this difficult situation: our friends stood shoulder to shoulder with us. When the gunfire subsided, the helping hands of our friends saved us from starvation, and in December we were able to start repairing the damaged buildings. We received gratuitous assistance in the form of various commodities worth more than 600 million forints from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, the German Democratic Republic, and Albania. The government of the People's Republic of China also provided us with assistance—30 million rubles in materials and cash.
    Our friends also helped us with long-term loans: we received a long-term loan of 250 million rubles from the Soviet Union and a long-term loan of 60 million rubles from the German Democratic Republic. Bulgaria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania also gave us loans to the best of their ability.
    This friendly assistance has had a great impact on our country's economic life, and it has also had a positive impact on the mood of our working people. We have come to recognize a new aspect of the lofty ideal of proletarian internationalism.
    I remember that people used to talk about the concept of proletarian internationalism. But only now do I realize how inadequately I understood the content of this term in the past. Now, in the fire ignited by the counter-revolution, people are beginning to see clearly that proletarian internationalism has a much deeper meaning in the mutual relations between socialist countries. That is to say, the interests of the countries advancing along the socialist road are closely intertwined; if one of the socialist countries is threatened, then the entire socialist camp is threatened at the same time.
    I feel that this letter of mine seems a little off topic, but I am trying my best to explain how the support of friendship played a good role in disintegrating the nationalist influence of the counter-revolution and how it encouraged the people to get rid of their feelings of disappointment and helplessness.
    The current situation is satisfactory. The people of our country have increasingly realized that friendly assistance, although invaluable at the time, can only solve the problem temporarily. To stand up completely, we must rely on our own strength. In particular, the performance of the coal miners these days has shown that we can rely on them.
    Before the October events, the coal industry produced 75,000 tons of coal per day and night. By the beginning of January, it could barely produce 30,000 tons of coal per day and night. According to experts' calculations, if coal production reaches 55,000 to 60,000 tons per day and night, it will take until July this year; 75,000 tons per day and night will take until the end of 1957. We also expect that due to insufficient power, some industrial sectors will have to reduce production and temporarily lay off 200,000 to 300,000 workers.
    However, the calculations of the coal miners, led by the Communist Party members, were different. At the end of January, coal production had reached 58,000 tons, and on February 9th it was 61,000 tons. This is more than the experts predicted for the end of June. At the Communist Party Congress in the city of Shágě'ěrtǎliáng, an old miner said: "The ministry only looks at the numbers. But we also think that if there is not enough coal, many workers will be laid off. Therefore, our miners not only work with their hands, but also put a lot of thought into it."
    The Hungarian miners have accomplished such a feat. Overturned the calculations of the experts in the individual ministry. As late as mid-January, I went to see a friend who is one of the leaders of the State Planning Commission. I went to his place at six o'clock in the afternoon, because we had agreed that he would be waiting for me at home at that time. But I waited for him all night, and he didn't come back until after nine o'clock. He told me that the entire plan had to be revised, because in January our coal production was already 50% higher than expected. He spoke excitedly, but it was obvious that he was very tired. At that time, he did not know that three weeks later, the plan would have to be completely revised again…
    Coal and electricity are now a matter of life and death for us. Thanks to our glorious coal miners, all power plants are working at full capacity. The large-scale layoffs of workers are no longer being discussed.
    The current situation is this: inflation is probably never going to happen. In 1945 and 1946, inflation was a heavy burden on Hungary's economic life. Money became less and less valuable day by day, and a box of matches cost several million. At that time, such astronomical figures had to be used for calculations, and as a result, it would have been simpler to calculate the price of things by the color of the banknotes. I remember that a store window once read: One kilogram of potatoes costs six yellow banknotes and two red banknotes. Of course, the poverty brought about by inflation first affects the workers who live on salaries. We don't want this to happen again.
    Finally, let me talk about Budapest. The work of repairing houses is proceeding rapidly. Traffic has been completely restored, and even new bus and trolleybus lines have been opened. There are no fewer vehicles in the city than last summer, and theaters and cinemas are always full. The rubble and garbage on the streets have been almost completely cleared. For this, we received specialized transport trucks from the Moscow and Prague City Soviets. Spring is coming, and Budapest will be as beautiful as it used to be.
    At the beginning of the letter, I wrote that we greeted the New Year with sorrowful hearts. We certainly still have many things to do. But I believe that this year will not only be a year of fighting difficulties, but also a year of smooth development. I hope that in future letters, I will have the opportunity to write to you about these situations. Budapest, February 15th (Translated by Jūn Qiáng)

    布达佩斯来信
    匈牙利记者  费·法比扬
    两个多月以前，我离开了中国的美丽的国土。自从在国境上的小车站满洲里同亲爱的中国朋友们分手以来，已经过去了两个多月。我觉得，一种永恒的友谊已经把我和中国朋友系在一起，他们目送着已经开动的火车时说的“从布达佩斯写信来”的话，至今好像还在耳边。由于时常听到这几个字，我已经能听懂这句中国话了。在广州和武汉，北京和哈尔滨，我的朋友们都曾这样同我告别，大家都要我把布达佩斯的情况、匈牙利的情况写给他们。
    当然我是能够早一些时候写这封信的。但是，当一个人必须写些痛苦的事情时，他就总是要把已写好的信一再搁置起来，因为他不愿意用坏消息使他非常爱的人感到忧伤。在那几个星期中，我就是怀着这种心情的。
    那时候我能够写些什么呢？
    10月23日以后的两个月间，反革命分子用强力和武装恐怖迫使大部分工厂的工人罢了工。这是一种奇怪的罢工。这种罢工反对工农政府，而政府在整个罢工期间却照常支付工人的工资。这种罢工是历史上前所未见的。这次奇怪的罢工代价很高——损失了一百四十亿福林，即相当于国民收入的15％。因而在那几个星期，通货膨胀的恐怖严重地威胁着人们。
    煤矿工业在12月底所开采的煤，仅够需要数量的三分之一。这就加深了情况的严重性。这时工人们已经开始懂得，继续罢工将会招致大灾难。因为动力的缺乏阻碍了生产。如果考虑到国民收入的65％是由工业得来的，那么立刻就会明白，缺乏动力意味着什么。
    关于我们美丽的首都，那时候我又能写些什么呢？有“蓝色多瑙河的美丽女王”之称的布达佩斯，在那些天中已经像是一个不体面的、落魄的、衣衫褴褛的老年乞妇，而不像是光彩夺目的女王了。许多被破坏了的住宅，打碎了的玻璃，瘫痪了的交通，夜晚空荡荡的街道，半明不亮的路灯和瓦砾，到处都是垃圾……
    我们非常痛苦地、心中充满了忧愁地迎接了今年的新年。亲爱的同志们，如果那时我写信给你们的话，我会使你们大大失望的。
    但是，那个时候的情况终归不是没有希望的。我们很快就深信，在这种严重的局势中我们并不孤独：我们的朋友们同我们并肩站在一起。当枪声平息以后，朋友们的支援的手，使我们避免了饥饿，而且在12月我们就能够着手修复遭到破坏的建筑物了。我们从苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、南斯拉夫、德意志民主共和国和阿尔巴尼亚得到了总值六亿多福林的各种商品的无偿援助。中华人民共和国政府也给予了我们援助——三千万卢布的物资和现金。
    朋友们还以长期贷款帮助了我们：我们得到了苏联的二亿五千万卢布的长期贷款，德意志民主共和国六千万卢布的长期贷款。保加利亚、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和罗马尼亚也都尽其所能地给了我们贷款。
    这种友谊的帮助对于我国的经济生活有着巨大的意义，同时也对我国劳动人民的情绪产生了良好的影响。我们认识了无产阶级国际主义崇高思想的一个新的方面。
    我记得过去人们时常谈到无产阶级国际主义这个概念。可是只有现在才明白过去对这个名词的内容了解得多么不够。现在，在反革命燃起的火光中，人们开始清楚地看到，无产阶级国际主义在社会主义国家的相互关系中具有深刻得多的意义。这就是说，沿着社会主义道路前进的各国的利益，是紧密地交织在一起的；如果社会主义国家之中有一个受到威胁，那么也就同时威胁到整个社会主义阵营。
    我觉得，我这封信似乎有一点写得离了题，但我这是极力想要说明：友谊的支援怎样对瓦解反革命的民族主义影响起了良好的作用，怎样鼓舞人民摆脱了失望无助的心情。
    目前的情况是令人满意的。我国人民已越来越认识到，友好的援助，尽管当时是无可估价的，但终究只能暂时解决问题。要完全挺起身来还应当靠自己的力量。特别是煤矿工人这些天的表现，已经说明我们是可以指靠他们的。
    十月事件以前，煤矿工业每昼夜产煤七万五千吨。到1月初，一昼夜只能勉强产煤三万吨。根据专家的计算，煤产量如果一昼夜达到五万五千吨至六万吨，这就需要到今年7月；一昼夜七万五千吨，则要到1957年年底才行。我们还预计，由于动力不足，一些工业部门不得不缩减生产，暂时要解雇二十万到三十万工人。
    但是，以共产党员为首的煤矿工人们的计算，却是另外一个样子。1月底，采煤量就已到达五万八千吨，2月9日是六万一千吨。这比专家们预计的6月底的产量还多。在夏戈尔塔良市共产党员大会上，一个老矿工说道：“部里只看数字。可是我们还想到，煤如果不够的话，许多工人就要被解雇。所以我们矿工们不仅用手做工，而且还用了许多心思。”
    匈牙利的矿工们完成了这样的事业。推翻了个别部的专家们的计算。还是1月中旬的时候，我曾去看望一位朋友，他是国家计划委员会的领导者之一。我是下午六点钟到他那里去的，因为我们约好他那时在家等我。我却等了他整整一个晚上，他直到九点多钟才回来。他告诉我说，整个计划都要修改，因为在1月份我们的煤产量已比预计多出了50％。他谈得兴高采烈，但是看得出他已是很疲倦了。当时他还不知道，三星期后，计划又要全部修改呢……
    煤和电力，现在是我们生命攸关的问题。由于我们的光荣的煤矿工人，全部发电站都开足马力地工作着。大规模解雇工人的事，早已经谈不到了。
    现在的情况是这样：通货膨胀大概是决不会发生了。在1945年和1946年，通货膨胀曾是匈牙利经济生活中的重担。钱一天比一天不值钱，一盒火柴的价格达到好几百万。当时不得不用这样巨大的天文数字来计算，结果，如果用钞票的颜色来计算东西的价钱反倒会简单的多。我记得，在一个商店橱窗上曾写着：一公斤马铃薯要六张黄色的和两张红色的钞票。当然，通货膨胀带来的贫穷，首先是影响到靠薪金生活的劳动者。我们不愿意这件事再重演。
    最后我再谈一谈布达佩斯。修复住宅的工作迅速地进行着。交通已经完全恢复，甚至还新开辟了公共汽车和无轨电车的线路。市内的车辆一点也不少于去年的夏天，剧院和电影院总是客满的。街上的瓦砾和垃圾差不多已经完全清除了。为了这件事，我们曾从莫斯科和布拉格的市苏维埃得到专门的运输卡车。春天来到了，布达佩斯将同过去一样美丽。
    在信的开头，我写到我们怀着忧愁的心情迎接了新年。我们当然还有许多事要做。但是我相信，今年将不仅是同困难作斗争的一年，也是顺利发展的一年。我希望，在以后的信中，有机会把这些情况写给你们。2月15日于布达佩斯（君强译）
