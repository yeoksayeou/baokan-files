Xinhua News Agency, Accra, 28th: (Our correspondent Peng Di reports) The Gold Coast is about to become an independent nation on March 6th. When this reporter arrived in Accra, preparations for the independence celebrations were in full swing. Traditional decorations could be seen everywhere, making this colorful tropical city in Asia and Africa particularly beautiful. Programs such as canoe races, tribal drumming performances, and dances are being rehearsed in various locations, preparing for grand celebratory performances throughout March.

This West African black nation, rich in cocoa, has been under the colonial rule of Portugal, the Netherlands, and Great Britain since the 15th century. Not only its abundant resources, but even its people were exploited and traded by the colonial powers. Therefore, it has long been known as the "Slave Coast." However, on the evening of March 5th, people will witness the British flag, a symbol of colonial rule, being lowered for the last time from the territory of the Gold Coast. People will parade and dance through the night, and on the morning of March 6th, the red, yellow, and green flag will be raised above the independent homeland. The name "Gold Coast," given by Western merchants, will also be officially changed to Ghana – the original name of the ancient West African independent kingdom.

Approximately sixty countries have accepted the invitation of the Gold Coast government to send government delegations to attend the independence celebrations. These include Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China, Marshal Nie Rongzhen; Soviet Minister of State Farms, V.T. Gikhov; British Home Secretary Butler; U.S. Vice President Nixon; Indian Foreign Secretary Desai; and Pakistani Minister of Education, Inzabi Ruddin, among others. Queen Elizabeth of Great Britain has decided to send the Duchess of Kent to represent the royal family at the celebrations.

Many African dependencies still under the rule of France, Britain, and Belgium have also decided to send delegations to attend Ghana's independence celebrations.

The first foreign delegation to arrive in Ghana was the Polish delegation. The head of the delegation, Polish Ambassador to Rome, Jan Druto, said upon arrival on the 25th that Poland would support Ghana's entry into the United Nations.

Certain Arab countries, such as Egypt and Syria, have not received invitations.

Ghana's independence is the result of a long struggle by the people and multiple constitutional reforms. The British constitutional proposals for Ghana, recently published in the form of a white paper, still stipulate that executive power will be vested in the British Queen, represented by the Governor-General, but actual legislative power will be vested in the parliament, and the cabinet will be responsible to the parliament. It is believed here that this is a great achievement in the struggle for independence.

Gold Coast Prime Minister and Chairman of the People's Convention Party, Kwame Nkrumah, said at a party meeting last weekend, "The ideals for which we have all sacrificed and striven are now finally in sight." He reminded people to remember "those terrible events that occurred in our struggle for national liberation" and emphasized, "Now that we have achieved freedom, the first and most important thing we must do is to very carefully defend this independence."

    各国使节云集盛况空前
    黄金海岸热烈准备庆祝独立
    新华社阿克拉28日电  本社记者彭迪报道：黄金海岸即将在3月6日成为一个独立的国家，当记者到达阿克拉的时候，庆祝独立典礼的准备工作正在热火朝天地进行着。到处都可以看到传统形式的装饰，使亚非这座多彩的热带城市显得非常美丽。各地都在排练节目，如独木舟比赛、部落击鼓表演和舞蹈等，准备在3月间进行盛大庆祝的演出。
    这个富产可可的西非黑人国家从十五世纪以来就先后处于葡萄牙、荷兰和英国的殖民统治之下。不仅它的富饶的资源，甚至连人也被殖民国家剥削和买卖。因此，它素来又被人称作“奴隶海岸”。但是，3月5日的晚上，人们将亲眼看到作为殖民统治的象征的英国国旗最后一次地从黄金海岸国土上降落下来。人们将彻夜地游行和歌舞，而在3月6日清早把红、黄、绿三色国旗升上独立祖国的上空。由西方商人叫出名的“黄金海岸”这个名字也将正式改成加纳——这是古代西非独立王国原来的名字。
    接受黄金海岸政府的邀请而决定派遣政府代表团前来参加这次庆祝独立典礼的有大约六十个国家，其中包括中华人民共和国副总理聂荣臻元帅，苏联国营农场部长别?吉克托夫，英国内政大臣巴特勒，美国副总统尼克松，印度外交部长联邦秘书德赛，巴基斯坦教育部英扎比鲁丁等。英国女王伊丽莎白决定派遣肯特公爵夫人代表王室到这里参加庆祝典礼。
    非洲许多现在仍旧处在法、英、比等国统治下的附属国也决定派遣代表团前来参加加纳独立典礼。
    第一个到达加纳的外国代表团是波兰代表团。代表团团长、波兰驻罗马大使扬·德鲁托在25日到达的时候说，波兰将支持加纳加入联合国。
    某些阿拉伯国家，如埃及、叙利亚等没有接到邀请。
    加纳获得独立是人民进行了长期的斗争和多次实行宪法改革的结果。英国最近用白皮书形式发表的加纳宪法建议仍然规定，行政权将归英国女王所有，由总督代表女王，但是实际立法权将归议会所有，内阁将对议会负责。这里认为，这是独立斗争所取得的一个巨大进展。
    黄金海岸总理、人民大会党主席恩克鲁玛上周周末在党的一次会议上说：“我们大家为之牺牲奋斗的理想现在终于在望了。”他提醒人们记住，“在我们争取国家解放的斗争中所发生的那些可怕事件”，并且强调指出：“现在我们已经获得了自由，我们必须作的第一件事情、也是最重要的一件事情，就是要非常小心地保卫这种独立”。
