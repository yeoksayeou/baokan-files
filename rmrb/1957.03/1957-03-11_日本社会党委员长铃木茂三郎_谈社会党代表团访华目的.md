Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th – Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Suzuki Mosaburo said today that the main purpose of the Socialist Party goodwill delegation, which is striving to visit China in mid-March, is to exchange views on strengthening Sino-Japanese friendly relations.

He said that the issues the Socialist Party delegation wants to exchange views with the Chinese side on include: the basic issue of restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, Asian economic cooperation, defending peace, banning nuclear weapons and disarmament, the conclusion of meteorological, postal, trade, fishery, cultural, and academic agreements between the two governments, and issues concerning war criminals.

He also said that the Socialist Party delegation is also willing to listen to Premier Zhou Enlai's specific thoughts on the Taiwan issue, and if possible, would like to ask for his opinions on the "peace issue between China and Taiwan."

Suzuki and Socialist Party Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma and other leaders took a car to Nagoya this morning to attend a lecture meeting held there this afternoon to "Overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet."

In the car, he told the accompanying press corps that he and Asanuma are considering candidates for the head and members of the delegation. The delegation will have five or six members, and Asanuma will serve as the head. They will make a formal decision as soon as possible after returning to Tokyo from Nagoya.

Suzuki also stated that after the end of the Diet session, the Japanese Socialist Party will send delegations to visit the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, West Germany, and Southeast Asian countries to enable these countries to better understand the Japanese Socialist Party’s foreign policy and promote friendly relations between these countries and Japan.
