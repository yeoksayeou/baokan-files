A Female Secretary Came to the District Committee
　　Yu Punong

　　Last year, when she and her husband were simultaneously transferred to Fei County, Shandong Province, she was overjoyed when her husband was assigned to work in an office. She had long envied the regular life of female comrades working in offices.

　　Her wish was not fulfilled. The organization decided to appoint her as the Deputy Secretary of the Liu Zhuang District Committee.

　　At the time, she had internal struggles. Going to the countryside was not unfamiliar to her, but for a woman who was about to become a mother of three, it was indeed inconvenient. However, she thought of the simple and enthusiastic farmers, and the advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives that had just turned one year old, which needed strengthened leadership; and since the organization had made a decision, a Communist Party member should not bargain. Although life would be a bit hard, it would be much better than for the women in the countryside. Her own children, staying in the office, with their father, and with someone to take care of them, eating well, and wearing warm clothes, what was there to worry about?

　　In late autumn, she gave birth to her third child. Holding the one-month-old infant, she came to Liu Zhuang District. This is the female secretary Song Guangkui, praised by the district cadres and masses, she is only twenty-six years old this year.

　　　　*　*　*

　　For the past two years, the work of Liu Zhuang District had often been criticized by the county committee. The work style of District Committee Secretary Xie Lianzhong was undemocratic, the members were not united, and everyone's work enthusiasm was not high. The District Committee Secretary simply conveyed the instructions of the County Committee, without research or discussion. Whatever he said counted, and the members came to listen and then left in a hurry. After Song Guangkui came to the District Committee, she actively approached everyone, and gradually, the general cadres in the district became familiar with her, and the pent-up feelings of one or two years were poured out to her.

　　From the situation reflected by everyone, she knew that District Committee Secretary Xie Lianzhong trusted himself too much and did not pay attention to giving play to the initiative of the cadres. Some cadres rarely received help and education from the District Committee. Xie Lianzhong often criticized cadres indiscriminately without asking the reasons, and even did not give the cadres below a chance to reply, so that some cadres felt wronged and became passive in their work.

　　The abnormal situation in the district made her restless. She discussed it with another Deputy Secretary, Wang Lijie, and they both felt that the shortcomings and mistakes could not be tolerated any longer. She put forward her own opinion: "To do a good job, we must start with the District Committee, promote democracy, and give play to the role of collective leadership." Wang Lijie supported her opinion.

　　From then on, at the District Committee meetings and at the district and township cadre meetings, they often pointed out some shortcomings in the work of the District Committee, hoping to inspire the District Committee Secretary to consciously correct his mistakes. After two months, although Xie Lianzhong sometimes made some self-criticism, he always emphasized objective reasons, criticized others more than he examined himself, and also said that he had always advocated democracy and discussed things with everyone, but everyone did not express their opinions.

　　This approach did not have much effect, and many problems existed in the cooperatives, which urgently needed to be strengthened. Song Guangkui felt that it was necessary to immediately change the leadership style. She discussed it with Wang Lijie again and decided to launch a frontal criticism of the District Committee Secretary.

　　At the District Committee meeting, she brought out all the opinions she had heard, hoping that criticism and self-criticism could be carried out at the District Committee meeting. However, the meeting failed. The reason was that although the members had many opinions behind their backs, they were afraid of retaliation when the issues were put on the table; in addition, the District Committee Secretary lacked the spirit of self-criticism, so everyone dared not speak. She felt very sad, remembering that the comrades who had reflected the opinions to her had warned her: "Secretary Xie is not easy to deal with, there is no work that does not make mistakes. He is the leader, and you are the deputy secretary, be careful, he will retaliate." Thinking of this, she was a little scared.

　　After several days of internal struggle, she felt that this was a selfish idea that was irresponsible to the Party. She examined herself and felt that she was a little too hasty and had not raised the cadres' awareness and relied on everyone to carry out criticism.

　　After research, she proposed at the District Committee meeting the issue of how to realize the Party's principle of collective leadership, and inspired everyone to start a discussion. In the discussion, everyone realized that it was wrong to think that only the secretary could speak and the members could listen, and that the secretary decided and the members executed. This was a liberal attitude that was irresponsible to the Party's cause. Everyone understood the Party's principle of collective leadership and knew the role and responsibilities of the Party committee. Later, she also talked with individual members, analyzed the harm of liberalism to the Party, and encouraged everyone to rely on the collective strength of the District Committee to solve problems.

　　The second District Committee meeting was smooth. All eleven members spoke. Because everyone was proceeding from work, Xie Lianzhong also accepted everyone's opinions and resolved to change his style.

　　　　　　*　*　*

　　Song Guangkui cares about the cadres and pays attention to helping them solve problems. For example, the female cadre Liu Xiuying, who has three children and many difficulties, does not work hard. Song Guangkui helped her deal with family problems. Seeing that she was about to give birth, she quickly gave her leave. Song Guangkui not only cared for her in life, but also helped her mobilize women and explained work methods to her. Liu Xiuying became active in her work, and she mobilized 80% of the women in Liujia Village to participate in production, and was praised.

　　Song Guangkui settled her home in the Guangfeng Township base point, five miles away from the district, and she lived in the homes of the masses.

　　Before and after the finalization of [agricultural] divisions, the situation in the cooperatives was very tense. Some cooperative members scolded the cooperative cadres, problematic cooperative cadres were afraid, and some cooperative cadres asked for a change of shifts. She and the comrades of the work team specifically helped the cooperative cadres summarize the work of the year, affirming that the general increase in production in each cooperative was the achievement of the cadres' leadership in running the cooperatives. They also analyzed the opinions of the masses, which were nothing more than a request to manage the cooperatives better. As long as the difficulties of lacking experience in running the cooperatives were explained to the masses, and the shortcomings were humbly reviewed, the masses would still support the cooperative cadres. With her help, the cooperative cadres accepted the opinions of the masses and made a good review. When electing cooperative cadres, except for two who had more serious mistakes, the original cooperative cadres were all re-elected.

　　Some of the elected cadres had concerns and were not at ease in their work. For example, Deputy Director Cheng Yongcai was very depressed because he had embezzled public funds and owed a lot of debt. She helped him analyze the situation, saying that embezzlement of public funds was wrong, but since he had already made a mistake, there was no use in being anxious. As long as he worked hard in the future, he could pay it back. She also mobilized the members, explaining that Cheng Yongcai had difficulties and allowing him to repay the debt after the wheat harvest distribution, and the masses had no objections. In this way, Cheng Yongcai completely unloaded his burden and devoted himself to work. She also helped and arranged for the unelected cadres separately. The original accountant was very pessimistic after being voted out because he was unclear about money. She explained to the members the difficulty that the cooperative had no literate people, explaining that everyone wanted to make progress. Although the accountant had made mistakes, as long as he corrected his mistakes and returned the cooperative's property, he could still do a good job. She suggested hiring him as an accountant again, and the masses agreed with her opinion. The accountant's enthusiasm was brought into play.

　　No mother does not love her children. Song Guangkui often said: "The two children are in the county office, we don't see each other much, I miss them terribly; one child is still breastfeeding, the wind hits his head and the rain hits his face, he hasn't lived in a warm house (without a stove) all winter, my heart aches." She not only stays at the Guangfeng Township base point, but also goes to Jiale, Yinzhuang and other townships about twenty miles away to inspect work. She leaves before dawn and returns after dark, and it is even more frequent to attend meetings at the District Committee. The several-month-old child often only eats milk powder during the day and rarely can lie in his mother's arms for a full meal.

　　Two heavy snows fell last winter and this spring, and it was not sunny for several days in a row. The snow fell heavily, a vast expanse of white, and the mountain road could not be seen. Song Guangkui attended a meeting at the District Committee until 8 pm, and the comrades wanted her to stay overnight. However, the mother thought that the child had not had milk all day, how could she fall asleep if she stayed? And the child was crying at home at this time because he was hungry. The village branch secretary and the township head held lanterns and welcomed her five miles away. The old landlady also braved the heavy snow to look out outside the village. When she returned home, the old women were moved to tears and blamed her for not treating the child like this.

　　It was another day of wind and snow. At 4 pm, she received a notice from the county that the new recruits would gather the next day. She needed to go to the District Committee to study this work. At that time, she was really embarrassed. The wind and snow were tight. If she didn't hold the child, it would be dark when she got to the district and she wouldn't be able to get back; if she held the child, he would freeze to death in such weather. With a heavy heart, she put on a bed sheet and went to the District Committee. By the time she finished the matter, it was already time to light the lamps. The snow on the way back was half a foot thick. She was anxious and sweating all over, and she couldn't see the road at all. She stepped into a big ditch and rolled in snow. With great difficulty, she found her way home. The old landlady quickly made her dinner, and the neighbors came to ask her how she was doing, blaming her for not taking care of herself like this. She said: "That's how you have to do revolution. I'm young, I'll recover in a while, what's there to be afraid of suffering a little!"

### 区委会来了个女书记

　　区委会来了个女书记
　　于朴农
    去年，当她和她的爱人同时调到山东省费县，爱人被分配做机关工作的时候，长期奔跑在农村里的她，是多么高兴啊！原来她很早就羡慕做机关工作的女同志的规律性的生活了。
    她的愿望，并没有实现，组织上决定她到刘庄区担任区委副书记。
    当时，她的思想是有斗争的。到农村去，对于她并不生疏，但是对快要成为三个孩子的母亲来说，这毕竟是不大方便的。可是，她想到那些纯朴而热情的农民，那些刚满一周岁的高级社，是多么需要加强领导；而且组织上既然作了决定，共产党员是不应该讲价钱的。生活虽然苦点，比起农村里的妇女来，要好的多。自己的孩子，留在机关里，守着爸爸，又有人专门照管，吃的饱，穿的暖，还有什么不放心呢。
    秋末，她生了第三个孩子，抱着满月的婴儿，来到了刘庄区。这就是区干部和群众所称赞的女书记宋光葵，她今年才二十六岁。
            *　*　*
    刘庄区的工作，近二年，经常是县委批评的对象。区委书记谢连忠的作风不民主，委员之间不团结，大家工作情绪不高。区委书记只是简单地照传县委的指示，不研究，不讨论，他自己说什么就算什么，委员们来听完了，匆匆就走。宋光葵来到区委以后，主动地和大家接近，慢慢地，区里一般干部和她熟悉起来了，憋了一两年的心里话，也就向她倾吐出来。
    从大家反映出来的情况当中她知道区委书记谢连忠过于相信自己，不注意发挥干部的积极性。有些干部很少得到区委的帮助和教育。谢连忠对干部常常不问情由乱加批评，甚至不给下面干部回话的余地。以致有些干部感到受了委屈。工作消极起来。
    区里的不正常的情况，弄得她坐立不安。她和另一个副书记王立节商量过，都觉得对缺点和错误，不能再迁就下去，她提出了自己的意见：“要搞好工作，必须先从区委会着手，发扬民主，发挥集体领导的作用。”王立节支持了她的意见。
    从此，在区委会上，在区、乡干部会上，他们就常常提出区委工作中的一些缺点，希望借此启发区委书记自觉改正错误。这样过了两个月，谢连忠虽然有时也做一点检讨，可是总是强调客观原因，批评别人还是多于检查自己，并且还表示自己从来就讲民主，有事和大家商议，只是大家不发表意见。
    这种作法效果不大，而合作社中存在许多问题，又急需加强领导。宋光葵觉得需要马上转变领导作风。她又和王立节商议，决定向区
  委书记开展正面的批评。
    她在区委会上，把听到的意见全盘都端出来了，希望在区委会上能够开展批评和自我批评。但是，这个会议失败了。原因是委员们虽然背后意见很多，但是一摆在桌面上，就怕报复；加上区委书记又缺少自我批评精神，大家就都不敢发言了。她心里很难过，想起向她反映意见的同志曾警告她：“谢书记不好惹，工作那有不犯错误的。他是领导，你又是副书记，小心，他会报复的。”想到这里，她也有些怕起来。
    经过了几天的内心斗争，她觉得这是对党不负责任的个人主义想法。她检查了一下，觉得自己有点操之过急，没有提高干部觉悟，依靠大家开展批评。
    她经过研究之后，就在区委会上提出：如何实现党的集体领导原则的问题，并启发大家展开讨论。在讨论中，大家才认识到过去认为在会议上只能书记说、委员听，书记决定、委员执行，这是不对的，这是对党的事业不负责任的自由主义态度。大家明白了党的集体领导原则，知道了党的委员会的作用和自己的责任。以后，她又和个别委员交谈，分析自由主义对党的危害，鼓励大家依靠区委会的集体力量来解决问题。
    第二次区委会议是顺利的。十一个委员都发了言。由于大家都是从工作出发，谢连忠也接受了大家的意见，决心改变自己的作风。
                  *　*　*
    宋光葵很关心干部，注意帮助他们解决问题。如女干部刘秀英，有三个孩子，困难很多，不大干工作。宋光葵就帮助她处理家庭问题。看到她快生产了，就赶快让她休假。宋光葵不仅生活上体贴她，还帮助她发动妇女，交代给她工作方法。刘秀英工作积极起来了，她发动了柳家村80％的妇女参加生产，受到了表扬。
    宋光葵把家安在离区五里的广丰乡基点，她就住在群众家里。
    决分前后，合作社里的情况很紧张，有些社员骂社干部，有毛病的社干部害怕，有些社干部要求换班。她和工作组的同志具体帮助社干部总结了一年的工作，肯定了各社普遍增产，是干部领导办社的成绩。他们也分析了群众的意见，无非是要求把社管理得更好，只要向群众说明办社没经验的困难，有缺点就虚心检讨，群众对社干部仍然会拥护的。在她的帮助下，社干部接受了群众的意见，作了很好的检讨。在选举社干部的时候，除两个错误比较严重的外，原来的社干部都连选连任了。
    有些被选上的干部有顾虑，不安心工作。如副社长程永才，因为挪用公款欠债多，很苦闷。她就帮他分析，说挪用公款是不对的，但是已经错了，急也没用，只要今后好好干，就能还上。她又动员社员，说明程永才有困难，允许他在麦季分配后还账，群众也没意见。这样，程永才就完全卸下了包袱投入工作。对落选的干部，她也分别进行帮助和安排。原来的会计因为手脚不清，落选后很悲观。她向社员说明社里没有识字人的困难，说明人都是想进步的。会计虽然犯了错误，可是，只要他改正了错误，还上社里的东西，一样能做好工作。她建议再聘请他当会计，群众同意了她的意见。会计的积极性发挥起来了。
            *　*　*
    母亲没有不疼爱自己的孩子的。宋光葵常说：“两个孩子在县机关，不大见面，想的慌；一个孩子还吃奶，风打头雨打脸，一冬没住个暖和屋（没有炉子），娘心里也疼的慌。”她不光是在广丰乡基点，还要到二十里左右的贾乐、殷庄等乡检查工作。天不明去，天黑才回来，到区委开会更是经常的。几个月的孩子白天常常只能吃点奶粉，很少能够躺在母亲的怀里饱餐一顿。
    去冬今春两场大雪，一连几天不晴。雪扑扑地下，一片白茫茫，看不到山路在那里。宋光葵在区委开会开到晚八点，同志们要她住下。但是，母亲想起小孩一天没吃到奶，住下怎么能睡得着呢？而孩子这时候也正在家里饿得直哭。村支部书记、乡长拿着灯一直迎到她五里路外。房东老大娘也冒着大雪到村外了望。她一回到家，老大娘们都感动得流泪，责备她，不该这样对待孩子。
    又是一个风雪交加的日子。下午四点钟她接到县的通知，第二天新兵集合。她需要到区委去研究一下这一工作。那时候她真为难，风雪正紧，不抱小孩吧，到了区上天就黑了，回不来；抱着小孩吧，这样天冻也冻死了。狠了狠心，披上一个被单她就到了区委。等到把事情办完，已到上灯时候。回来的路上雪已半尺厚。她心里发急，身上光淌汗，看不到一点路，一脚闯到大沟里，滚了一身雪。好容易摸到了家，房东大娘赶忙给她做饭，邻居也来问长问短，责难她不该这样不爱惜身子。她说：“干革命就得这样，年轻轻的一会儿就歇过来了，受这点累怕什么！”
