    Arranging Production Properly When Raw Material Supply is Insufficient:
    Beijing's Hand-Weaving Industry Switches Varieties to Increase Production of Colored Cloth
    (Our Dispatch) Beijing – After the Beijing Cotton Textile Production Cooperative Union reduced the supply of cotton yarn, it adopted measures such as changing varieties and utilizing waste materials to better arrange production.
    The weaving production cooperatives originally wove "21 Plain White Cloth," with each machine weaving 4.54 meters per hour and using 1.3005 pounds of yarn. If they switch to weaving plaid flannel, each machine can only weave 2.5 meters per hour, using an average of 0.598 pounds of yarn. The revenue from weaving plaid flannel is higher than that of weaving plain white cloth, and there is a high market demand. Therefore, these cooperatives decided to reduce the planned output of white cloth from 49.8% to 9%. It is estimated that the output of colored cloth such as colored striped flannel and corduroy, which uses less yarn and more labor, will account for 90% of the total output in the first and second quarters. In the third and fourth quarters, all production will be converted to colored cloth. In this way, although the total output of various cloths will decrease, the annual output value will increase compared to 1956, and the wages of the cooperative employees can be maintained at last year's level. After the variety conversion of each cooperative, weaving workers can be transferred to yarn dyeing and cloth dyeing or other auxiliary work.
    At the end of last year, the weaving production cooperatives began to feel that the production tasks were insufficient, so they organized a regeneration cooperative, extracting a portion of people specifically to weave recycled cotton blankets using waste fleece edges cut from knitting factories, waste cloth heads from sewing cooperatives, and old cotton from residents. This kind of recycled blanket is durable and only sells for six yuan per blanket, which is welcomed by consumers. Beijing has abundant waste material resources that can be used to make cotton blankets. The Cotton Textile Union also plans to transfer one hundred and twenty people from the weaving production cooperatives to weave cotton blankets, and the production volume of cotton blankets will increase to more than 127,000 blankets.

    在原料供应不足的情况下妥善安排生产
    北京市手工织布业改换品种增产色布
    本报讯  北京市棉织生产合作社联合社，在棉纱供应量减少以后，为了更好地安排生产，采取了改换品种、利用废料等项措施。
    织布生产合作社原来织“二一白布”，每台机每小时可织四点五四公尺，用纱一点三零零五磅；如改为织格呢，每台机每小时只能织二点五公尺，平均用纱零点五九八磅。织格呢的收益比织白布还高，市场也很需要。因此，这些社决定把原计划白布产量由49.8％减少到9％。预计第一、二季度各色条格呢和灯芯绒等用纱少用工多的色布产量将占总产量的90％，第三、四季度将全部改产色布。这样，尽管各种布的总产量有所减少，但是全年产值将比1956年有所增加，社员工资也能维持去年的水平。各社品种改换以后还可以抽调织布工去染纱和染布或做其他辅助工作。
    去年年底织布生产合作社的生产任务开始感到不足，他们就组织了再生合作社，抽出一部分人专门用针织厂剪下来的废绒边、缝纫社的废布头和居民不要的旧棉花织再生棉毯。这种再生毯，坚固耐用，每床只卖六元，受到消费者的欢迎。北京市可以用来制棉毯的废料资源很多。棉织联社还准备从织布生产合作社抽调一百二十人织棉毯，棉毯的生产量将增加到十二万七千多条。
