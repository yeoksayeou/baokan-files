From a series of speeches, reports, and explanations made by our Party and government leaders before and after the opening of this conference, I deeply understand the specific manifestation of the combination of Marxism-Leninism and China's construction practice. At the same time, I also realize that, due to the tremendous achievements of our socialist transformation and construction, the protection and striving for world peace have also flourished, the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has grown stronger, and the number of peace-loving people around the world has increased; therefore, they can no longer arbitrarily launch wars like the invasion of Egypt, and we are very likely to carry out peaceful labor within a certain period. We must, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, constantly raise our vigilance, utilize time, location, and conditions, and coordinate manpower, material resources, and financial resources to complete our every five-year plan earlier and ahead of schedule. Now, I would like to offer some suggestions specifically on increasing production and practicing economy in heavy industry:

	I. Vigorous Development of Hydropower Stations

	Water is the cheapest and inexhaustible thing. It is well known that China's hydropower resources are abundant. For more than seven years, the Party and the government have paid attention to water conservancy construction, and the water disasters that have often caused harm for thousands of years have been reduced a lot, and a solid foundation has also been laid for hydropower generation. In the future, in areas with comprehensive water conservancy utilization hubs, large-scale hydropower stations should be sponsored by the central government; provinces and regions should build as many medium-sized and small-sized hydropower stations as possible, not only to supply power to light and heavy industries, but also to supply light, heat, and possible power to agriculture and handicrafts. This is one of the important methods of saving coal. From the surface, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region seems to have insufficient water sources. In fact, there is the Liao River in the east, the Yellow River in the west, and 78 rivers longer than 40 kilometers in the territory, all of which can be used to build different types of hydropower stations. It can also save a lot of coal for the Baotou Iron and Steel Base. Railway electrification is still difficult for us at present, but it will be a direction for development in the future. Last year, the Soviet Union saved 20 million tons of coal from railway electrification, which is about one-fifth of China's coal production last year. At the same time, the Soviet Union also vigorously developed medium-sized and small-sized hydropower stations, which is worth learning from.

	II. Correct Use of Coal

	Using coal as fuel, except for places without hydropower and large-scale high-pressure and high-temperature thermal power stations, the heat loss is too great and it is extremely uneconomical. Cooking and heating in large cities should be approached from the perspective of electricity or gas, which is beneficial to the hygiene of citizens. Coke for metallurgy should also be replaced by electricity from hydropower stations. It is most ideal to keep good coal for use as a raw material for the chemical industry to increase production and practice economy. The value of synthetic petroleum, chemical fertilizers, synthetic rubber, plastics, pigments, medicines, explosives, and other products in the chemical industry is much greater than that of coal itself. The cost of synthetic petroleum is still high at present (except for the dry distillation of oil shale), but natural petroleum is always limited, and the need for gasoline is always unlimited. We should seek substitutes for limited materials as early as possible, which is another important method of increasing production and practicing economy.

	III. Adoption of New Type Short Blast Furnaces

	Last year, the National Handicraft Cooperative Federation called for increasing the production of local iron (see People's Daily, December 27, 1956) to make up for the shortage of steel raw materials, which is one of the effective methods. Advanced industrial countries still use charcoal blast furnaces even when their industries have already developed greatly. China has a long history of local iron and steel smelting, and it also played a huge role during the Anti-Japanese War. Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Hunan, Jiangxi, Yunnan, and Sichuan all produce local iron, and Shanxi's sponge iron and Sichuan's Su Steel are excellent products. However, today's local iron smelting is not productive because charcoal is too expensive and affects afforestation, and earth coke has too much sulfur, resulting in great losses. Also it is a sideline of farmers, so it is seasonal, and the output is not large. To meet the needs of handicrafts, agriculture, and even light industry, it seems appropriate to add new type short blast furnaces, which are operated by local governments. This type of short blast furnace has only been available in Western Europe in recent years. It can use lean iron ore and low-quality coal (without coke) as furnace feed, and use oxygen-enriched blast to produce 40-50 tons of iron per furnace every 24 hours. The waste gas from the furnace can be used as fuel for steam boilers, and the slag can be used to make bricks and cement, so the cost is not high. If we have 40-50 such short blast furnaces, we can increase the production of pig iron by 600,000-750,000 tons per year. In addition, old factories and equipment that have been unused should be restored and rebuilt instead of being demolished, which is in line with the direction of local industrial development.

	IV. Rational Utilization of Steel Cuttings

	Due to the rapid development of the machinery manufacturing industry, the amount of steel required is very large. In order to cut steel into products of various shapes, a lot of cuttings will inevitably be produced. According to incomplete estimates, the amount of cuttings in China's machinery industry will be nearly 300,000 tons per year (see People's Daily, February 15 this year). If so many steel cuttings can be recovered and utilized well, it may greatly make up for the shortage of steel production. In the Soviet Union and some Western countries, in addition to large pieces of cut heads (such as the cut heads of steel rolling mills) that are still returned to the furnace for steelmaking, the remaining small cuttings are dried and ground into fine powder, which is used as one of the raw materials for powder metallurgy. Powder metallurgy is a new technical science and the fastest method for manufacturing mechanical parts. If China's machinery industry departments can set up factories to trial-produce mechanical parts, the investment is not large, which is better than pressing steel cuttings into blocks and sending them to cupolas, which is quite a step ahead.

	V. Joint Research on One-Step Steelmaking Method

	The construction of modern iron and steel industrial enterprises requires too much investment, too long of a construction period, and large consumption of raw materials. Small mining areas cannot be utilized, and it is impossible for all raw materials in large mining areas to be together, so transportation costs are very high. Some work is extremely heavy labor, and some processes and operations are equivalent to waste and rework. For example, blast furnaces use coke as fuel and as a reducing agent, so pig iron contains a lot of carbon (about 4%), which must be refined with open-hearth furnaces or converters to remove impurities such as carbon, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus. If advanced alloy steel is to be made, an electric furnace must be used, which is expensive for thermal electricity. Although many people have wanted to make steel directly from iron ore for nearly a hundred years, it is impossible to succeed under the capitalist system, because the more they invest, the greater the profit from exploiting surplus value. If they cannot produce in large quantities, it does not meet their requirements. If we use hydroelectric electric furnaces to smelt iron and steel (Sweden has adopted it), it will not only save a lot of fuel but also reduce a lot of equipment, shorten the smelting time, and reduce heavy labor. If we can use another reducing agent to replace coke, we can melt iron and steel into one furnace and accomplish the task in one battle. Now the Soviet Union and the Czech Republic are studying the one-step steelmaking method, but the only shortcoming is that it cannot be produced in large quantities. How to attack this stubborn fortress is the common responsibility of workers and brothers and technical scientists in China's metallurgical industrial enterprises. I think that the method of dividing the whole into parts and accumulating small amounts can solve part of the problem. Under the principle that "large factories cannot be too many or too few," the safety of national defense can also be taken into account. Therefore, the construction methods of large, medium, and small types and the adoption of the latest technology are the most reasonable development directions for our country at present.

	In general, since the Party put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," it has greatly encouraged and improved the enthusiasm and creativity of the working people and intellectuals across the country, which is very natural. The reason why this policy is great and has vitality is because "the core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China" and "the theoretical basis guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism." "As soon as the theory is grasped by the masses, it immediately becomes a material force." This force can make mountains bow their heads, make rivers give way, and change the face of nature. As long as we learn with an open mind and understand carefully, it is impossible to become prisoners of dogmatism or revisionism, and we will definitely be able to contribute our strength that does not bow to any difficulties in the high tide of building a great socialist motherland and defending world peace and opposing wars of aggression.

	I ask everyone to correct my immature opinions.

    关于重工业增产节约的几项建议
    胡庶华的发言
    从这次会议开幕前后我们党、政领导人所作一系列的讲话、报告和说明中，我深深体会到马克思列宁主义与中国建设实践相结合的具体表现。同时，我也认识到，由于我国社会主义改造和建设获得巨大成就，世界和平的保卫和争取也有蓬勃发展，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量日益强大，全世界爱好和平人民的数量日益加多，帝国主义阵营内部矛盾日益尖锐化；因此，他们也就不可能再像侵略埃及那样任意地发动战争，而我们却大有可能在一定时期内进行和平劳动。我们必须在党和毛主席的领导下经常提高警惕，利用时间、地点和条件，配合人力、物力和财力来提早和超额完成我们的每一个五年计划。现在，我想专就重工业的增产节约方面提供一些建议：
    一、水电站的大力发展
    水是最便宜而用不尽的东西。我国水力资源丰富，人所共知。七年多以来，党和政府注重水利建设，把几千年经常为害的水灾已经减轻不少，也为水力发电打下了坚固基础。今后凡有水利综合利用枢纽的地区，宜由中央主办大型水电站；各省区则尽可能多办中、小型水电站，不仅供给轻、重工业的动力，而且也供给农业和手工业的光与热和可能用的动力。这是节约煤炭的重要方法之一。像内蒙古自治区从表面看来，似乎水源不足，其实，东有辽河，西有黄河，又境内还有七十八条长四十公里以上的河流，都可以建设不同类型的水电站，也可以把大量的煤炭节省下来供包头钢铁基地之用。铁道电气化，在目前我们尚有困难，而将来却是一个发展方向。苏联去年一年从铁道电气化方面节约了煤炭二千万吨，约等于我国去年产煤量的五分之一。同时，苏联也大力发展了中、小型水电站，是值得我们效法的。
    二、煤炭的正确使用
    把煤炭当作燃料，除用于没有水力地方和大型的高压高温的热电站外，都是热损失太大，极不经济的。大城市的炊事和取暖都应当从电气或煤气想办法，对于市民卫生才有好处。冶金用的焦炭也应当用水电站的电来代替。把好煤留下来做化学工业的原料，是最理想的增产节约。化学工业中的人造石油、化学肥料、人造橡胶、塑料、颜料、药品、炸药以及其他产品等的价值比煤炭本身大得多、人造石油在目前成本尚高（油母页岩干馏除外），但是，天然石油总是有限的，而汽油的需要总是无限的。我们对有限的物资应当尽早求得代用品，这又是增产节约的重要方法之一。
    三、新型矮高炉的采用
    全国手工业合作总社去年号召增产土铁（见1956年12月27日人民日报）以弥补钢铁原料的不足，这是有效的办法之一，先进工业国在工业已经大发展的情况下还有用木炭高炉的。我国土法炼铁制钢，有悠久的历史，在抗日战争时期，也发生了巨大的作用。山西、河北、河南、山东、湖南、江西、云南和四川，均生产土铁，而山西的海绵铁，四川的苏钢都是优良产品。但在今日土法炼铁因木炭太贵，且影响造林，用土焦则硫黄多而损失大，且系农民副业，有季节性，故产量不多。要供给手工业、农业甚至轻工业的需要，似宜添设新型矮高炉，由地方政府经营。这种矮高炉是近年西欧才有的，可用贫铁矿和低质煤（不用焦炭）为炉料，并用富氧鼓风每炉每二十四小时可产生铁四十——五十吨，炉的废气可作蒸汽锅炉的燃料，炉渣可制砖和水泥，因此成本不高。假如我们有这样的矮高炉四十——五十座就可每年增产生铁六十——七十五万吨，此外，对原有而未用的旧厂和设备，应当恢复和改建，不宜拆毁，都是适合于地方工业发展方向的。
    四、钢铁切屑的合理利用
    由于机械制造工业的迅速发展，需用钢铁数量是很大的。为了将钢铁切削成各种形状的产品，就一定产生不少的切屑。根据不完全的估计，我国全年机械工业的切屑量将近三十万吨（见本年2月15日人民日报）。这样多的钢铁切屑，如果能够很好地收回和利用，就可能在很大程度上弥补钢铁生产的不足。在苏联和某些西方国家除大块切头（如轧钢厂的切头）仍回炉炼钢外，其余细小切屑，经过烘干和磨细后，作为粉末冶金的原料之一。粉末冶金是一门新兴的技术科学，为制造机械零件最快的方法。我国机械工业部门如能设厂试制机械零件，投资不大，较之现在把钢铁切屑压成块状送入冲天炉，颇胜一筹。
    五、一步炼钢法的共同研究
    现代钢铁工业企业的建设，投资过巨，基建时间太长，原料消费量大，小矿区无法利用，大矿区也不可能所有原料都在一起，因而运输费用很大。有些工作是极其繁重的劳动，有些过程和操作又等于浪费和返工，比如高炉用焦炭做燃料，又做还原剂，所以生铁含碳很多（4％左右），必须再用平炉或转炉来精炼，才能把碳矽、硫和磷等杂质除去。若制炼高级合金钢必须用电炉而热电又贵。近百年来虽然有不少的人想从铁矿直接炼钢，但在资本主义制度下是不可能成功的，因为他们投资愈多，剥削剩余价值的利润也就愈大，如果不能大量生产，就不合乎他们的要求。假如我们用水电电炉炼铁炼钢（瑞典已采用），不仅节约许多燃料而且减省不少设备，缩短冶炼时间，减轻繁重劳动；假如我们能另外用一种还原剂来代替焦炭，我们就可以把炼铁炼钢熔为一炉，毕其功于一役。现在苏联和捷克都正在研究一步炼钢的方法，而唯一缺点在于不能大量生产。如何向这个顽强的堡垒进军，是我国冶金工业企业中工人弟兄们和技科科学家们共同的责任。我认为用化整为零、聚少成多的方法，未始不可以解决一部分的问题。在“大厂不可多，也不可太少”的原则下，还可以照顾到国防上的安全性。所以大中小三种类型的建设方法和最新技术的采用是我国当前最合理的发展方向。
    总的说来，自从党提出了“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，大大地鼓舞了和提高了全国劳动人民和知识分子的积极性和创造性，这是很自然的。这个方针之所以伟大而有生命力，是因为“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党”，“指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义”。“理论只要一掌握群众，就立刻成为物质的力量”。这个力量可以令高山低头，叫河水让路，使大自然的面貌改观。只要我们虚心学习，细心体会，就不可能做教条主义或修正主义的俘虏，而且一定能够在建设伟大的社会主义的祖国和保卫世界和平、反对侵略战争的高潮中，贡献我们不向任何困难低头的力量。
    我这些不成熟的意见，请大家指正。
