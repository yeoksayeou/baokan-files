    Make Good Use of Existing Large Farm Implements

    Last year, in order to meet the agricultural production needs after agricultural cooperativization, the state allocated a large amount of steel to manufacture a large number of large-scale farm implements and water lifting equipment. According to statistics, over 1.1 million double-wheeled double (single) furrow plows, over 50,000 seeders and harvesters, 30,000 horsepower of locomobiles and gas engines, and over 590,000 various iron waterwheels have been supplied to agricultural cooperatives through supply and marketing cooperatives. In order to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest in 1957, in addition to continuing to promote and increase supply realistically in areas where conditions permit promotion and use, agricultural cooperatives in various regions should make full use of existing large-scale farm implements and water lifting equipment as much as possible.

    Over the past few years, agricultural cooperatives have greatly improved the efficiency of using large-scale farm implements and water lifting equipment. For example, in 25 counties of Heilongjiang Province, over 11,000 sets of large-scale farm implements cultivated more than 640,000 hectares of land last year, an 89% increase in the efficiency of each set compared to the previous year. Some areas have trained a large number of technicians and organized the technicians of production teams through the technical groups of agricultural cooperatives, the technical networks of townships, and the technical extension stations of counties to hold regular meetings, exchange experiences, and solve practical operational problems that arise at any time, ensuring the continuous improvement of the technical level of technicians. Some agricultural cooperatives have adopted the method of specifying what draft animals should be used, who should use them, and on what land they should be used, according to the different performance and usage requirements of various farm implements. These methods have had a very good effect on the maintenance of farm implements and the improvement of usage efficiency.

    However, on a nationwide scale, many large-scale farm implements and water lifting equipment have not been fully utilized. According to a survey of 513 agricultural cooperatives in 16 provinces in Northeast China, North China, and the Yangtze River Delta, 35.6% of the 5,435 double-wheeled double (single) furrow plows were not used; of these, 13% were in the Northeast region, 28% in the North China region, and 74% in the Yangtze River Delta region. Even those that were used did not reach the proper amount of cultivation. The Northeast region generally only reached 75% of the intended cultivation, the North China region only reached 60%, and the Yangtze River Delta region was even worse. The situation is roughly the same for water lifting equipment. For example, in the Gu Shu Ji area of Yucheng County, Henan Province, 35% of the waterwheels were "sleeping"; in Shan County, unused waterwheels also accounted for 30.3% of the purchased waterwheels. According to statistics from 36 counties in Guangdong, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Shandong, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu provinces, among the 678 locomobiles and gas engines promoted last year, 263 were not used, accounting for 39% of the supply. Among them, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces, due to better water source conditions and many years of usage foundation, have already used 85% of the promoted equipment. The Northeast region has used 65% of the promoted equipment. The North China region only accounts for 35%. The usage efficiency of those already in use also varies greatly.

    Based on the above situation, calculating the double-wheeled double (single) furrow plows shows that if the existing large-scale farm implements can be used well, it will be of great benefit to saving national material supplies and agricultural cooperative production investment, and to striving for a bumper agricultural harvest. If about 35% of the "sleeping plows" among the double-wheeled double (single) furrow plows supplied nationwide by the end of last year (including the supply from previous years) are used, it will be equivalent to increasing the supply by 520,000 units; if the ones already in use are given full play to their effectiveness, then the country will be equivalent to supplying 800,000 more units; this is also equivalent to saving the country 80,000 tons of steel, saving agricultural cooperatives 64 million yuan in production investment, and also increasing agricultural production.

    How can we give full play to usage efficiency? According to the experience of various regions: First, we must conscientiously train technicians and continuously improve their technical level. This is the key to giving full play to the effectiveness of large-scale farm implements. In the past few years, especially last year, various regions have trained a considerable number of technicians, and their technical level has also improved to a certain extent. However, due to a lack of experience, some areas trained too few technicians; or the training methods were inappropriate, and the training quality was not high, so the technical transmission could not keep up with the requirements of promotion work. Although some areas trained a large number of people, their use was not fixed, so after a period of time, the technicians lost their skills. Many areas have not organized technicians in appropriate forms, and technicians from various cooperatives and teams have no opportunity to exchange experiences. When encountering new and difficult problems in actual operation, they cannot be solved, so their technical level is not easy to improve. Some areas only pay attention to training in usage techniques and neglect education in maintenance knowledge and maintenance responsibility systems. In addition, the quality of parts of some farm implements is not good, so the damage rate of farm implements is very high. Some agricultural cooperatives' work point assessments for technicians are also unreasonable and cannot stimulate technicians to work hard to improve their technical level. The agricultural production leading departments in various regions should conduct a general inspection of the above problems, and then seriously solve them according to the specific situation.

    Second, parts should be supplied in a timely manner, and repair and assembly should be organized. According to the inspection of 13 districts in Teng County, Shandong Province, the damage rate of various new-style farm implements is between 10% and 20%. Ping Shang District, Ju Nan County, Shandong Province, inspected 801 double-wheeled double (single) furrow plows and lost and damaged a total of 897 parts. This situation is roughly the same in various provinces. Now, supply and marketing cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives in Shandong and other provinces have carried parts into agricultural cooperatives to carry out comprehensive inspections and repairs, which has produced good results. However, many areas have not yet paid attention to this work. Some of them still do not understand the extent of damage to farm implements; some have not yet organized the source of parts; some have parts but have not gone deep into agricultural cooperatives for comprehensive inspection and repair. These problems urgently need to be solved.

    Third, the surplus and deficiency adjustment between regions and between cooperatives should be organized appropriately. Last year, some large-scale farm implements were supplied to unsuitable areas; some agricultural cooperatives purchased quantities exceeding their needs. At the same time, there are also some areas with usage conditions that have not been promoted or the quantity promoted is small; some agricultural cooperatives do not have enough of the existing large-scale farm implements, or the varieties are not suitable, but adding another one would be redundant. In this case, it is necessary to adjust the surplus to the deficient areas, adjust the farm implements of unsuitable varieties to suitable areas, and, according to the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit, organize agricultural cooperatives with surplus cultivation, planting, and harvesting capacity to help agricultural cooperatives with insufficient farm implements to cultivate land, sow seeds, or harvest crops, and obtain certain compensation. This kind of surplus and deficiency adjustment can make the use of farm implements reasonable and save agricultural investment.

    In addition, for those with insufficient draft animal conditions, the draft animal problem must be solved; for those with inappropriate models, they should be appropriately exchanged; for those that need to be refitted, they should be refitted in a timely manner; the water source problem related to the use of water conservancy machinery and the farming system problem of various farm implements, etc., should also be solved as soon as possible.

    In order to realize these methods, party committees at all levels, especially county party committees, should strengthen leadership and inspection of relevant departments; all relevant departments should cooperate closely, come up with various effective methods, and make good use of existing large-scale farm implements and water lifting equipment.

    好好使用已有的大农具
    去年为了满足农业合作化以后的农业生产的要求，国家拿出大量的钢材，制造了大量的大型农具和提水设备。据统计，已经通过供销合作社供应到农业社的，有双轮双（单）铧犁一百一十多万部，播种机、收割机等五万多部，锅驼机、煤气机三万多马力，各种铁制水车五十九万多部。为了争取1957年农业大丰收，除了在有条件推广和使用的地区实事求是地继续推广和增加供应外，各地农业社应该尽可能地把已有的大型农具和提水设备充分地使用起来。
    几年来农业合作社对于大型农具和提水设备的使用效率，已有很大的提高。比如黑龙江省二十五个县一万一千多套大型农具，去年共耕耘土地六十四万多垧，每套的使用效率比前年提高89％。有些地区大量地训练了技术员，并且通过农业社的技术小组、乡的技术网、县的技术推广站，把生产队的技术员组织起来，定期开会、交流经验、解决实际操作中随时发生的疑难问题，保证了技术员技术水平的不断提高。有些农业社采用的办法是：按照各种农具的不同性能和使用要求，规定应当用什么耕畜，由谁去用，在什么土地上使用。这些办法对于农具的保养和使用效率的提高，都有很好的效果。
    但是，就全国范围说来，很多大型农具和提水设备还没有充分使用起来。根据东北、华北、江南等地区十六个省的五百一十三个农业社的调查，五千四百三十五部双轮双（单）铧犁中，没有使用的占35.6％；其中东北地区是13％，华北地区是28％，江南地区是74％，就是已经使用起来的，也没有达到应有的耕作量。东北地区一般只达到应耕作量的75％，华北地区只达到60％，江南地区则更差。以提水设备来说，情况也大体相同。比如河南虞城县谷熟集两个农业社，就还有35％的“睡车”；陕县未安装的水车也占已购水车的30.3％。据广东、辽宁、黑龙江、河北、山东、浙江、江苏等省三十六个县统计，去年推广的六百七十八台锅驼机和煤气机中，没有使用的有二百六十三台，占供应数的39％。其中江苏、浙江、广东三省因水源条件较好，又有多年使用基础，已使用的占推广数的85％。东北地区已使用的占推广数的65％。华北地区只占35％。已经使用起来的，使用效率也相差很大。
    根据以上情况，把双轮双（单）铧犁算一个账，就可以知道，已有的大型农具如果能够好好地使用起来，对于节省国家物资供应和农业社的生产投资，争取农业大丰收，将有很大好处。如果把全国到去年年底（包括前几年供应数）已供应的双轮双（单）铧犁中大约35％的“睡犁”使用起来，就等于增加供应五十二万部；再把已使用的充分发挥其效能，那末，全国就等于多供应八十万部；这也就等于给国家节省八万吨钢材，给农业社节省六千四百万元的生产投资，还可以使农业增产。
    怎样才能充分发挥使用效能呢？根据各地经验：第一、要认真地训练技术员，不断地提高技术员的技术水平。这是充分发挥大型农具效能的关键问题。过去几年，特别是去年，各地都以相当力量训练了不少的技术员，技术员的技术水平也有一定程度的提高。但是由于缺乏经验，有些地区训练的技术员太少；或者训练方法不适当，训练质量不高，因而技术传授赶不上推广工作的要求。有些地区虽然训练的人数不少，但使用不固定，因而过一个时期以后，技术员就丢掉了技术。有不少地区没有把技术员用适当形式组织起来，各社各队的技术员没有机会交流经验，实际操作中遇到新的疑难问题，没法解决，因而技术水平不易提高。有些地区只注意训练使用技术，忽视保养知识和保养责任制的教育。加之部分农具的零件质量不好，因而农具的损坏率很高。也有些农业社对技术员的工分评定得不合理，不能刺激技术员努力提高技术水平。上述问题，各地农业生产领导部门应该进行普遍检查，然后根据具体情况，认真解决。
    第二、要及时地供应零件和组织修配。据山东滕县十三个区的检查，各种新式农具的损坏率都在10％—20％。山东莒南县坪上区检查了八百零一部双轮双（单）铧犁，共丢失和损坏零件八百九十七件。这种情况，各省大体相同。现在山东等省的供销合作社和手工业社，已携带零件深入农业社进行全面的检查、修配，产生了很好的效果。但有不少地区还未重视这一工作。其中有些还不了解农具的损坏程度；有些还未组织零件货源；有些虽然有了零件，但没有深入农业社进行全面检查和修配。这些问题急需解决。
    第三、要适当地组织地区间、社与社间的余缺调剂。去年有些大型农具供应到不适用的地区；有些农业社购置的数量超过了自己的需要。同时，也还有些地区有使用条件而没有推广或推广的数量较少；有些农业社现有的大型农具数量不够用，或者品种不对路，但是再增添一部又有多余。在这种情况下，就需要把多余的调剂到不足的地方去，把品种不对路的农具调到对路的地方去，并且根据互助两利的原则，组织有耕、种、收割余力的农业社帮助农具不足的农业社耕地、播种或收割，取得一定的报酬。这种余缺的调剂，能使农具使用合理，而且节约农业投资。
    此外，耕畜条件不够的，要解决耕畜问题；型号不适当的，适当加以调换；需要改装的，要及时改装；与水利机械使用有关的水源问题以及各种农具的耕作制度问题等等，也都应当尽快地设法解决。
    为了实现这些办法，各级党委特别是县委应当加强对有关部门的领导和检查；各个有关部门应当密切协作，想出各种有效办法，把已有的大型农具和提水设备好好地使用起来。
