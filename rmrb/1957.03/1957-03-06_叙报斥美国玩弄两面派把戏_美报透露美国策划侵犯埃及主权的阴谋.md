Xinhua News Agency, March 5th: TASS, Damascus, 4th - The Syrian newspaper "Al-Jamahir" published an editorial stating: "The United States is trying to force free Arab countries to accept the 'Eisenhower Doctrine' and is playing two-faced tactics. This is enough to explain why the United States, while 'calling' for Israeli withdrawal in its statements, is doing everything possible to delay the United Nations' discussion on this issue and is trying to provide Israel with guarantees that damage the national interests of Arab countries."

Xinhua News Agency, March 5th: TASS, New York, 4th - "New York Times" reporter Reston wrote, in reporting on the US's withdrawal guarantee to Israel, that Secretary of State Dulles's suggestion can be summarized as the United States announcing that it will "protect American ships passing through the Straits of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba," that is, to infringe upon the territorial waters of Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Reston pointed out that, in the eyes of people in Tel Aviv, Dulles's words are tantamount to instructing them that the United States allows Israel to "take similar actions" at any time, that is, to use armed forces in the name of "protecting Israel's sovereignty."

Associated Press reporters, in reporting on the dispatch of American warships to the Red Sea, said that the United States "wants to put pressure on Egypt individually and collectively..."

"New York Herald Tribune" reporter Higgins reported that in the future, "the United States or some other country considering the same will put forward a proposal to change the role and mission of the United Nations police force from ordinary ceasefire observers to a force that maintains peace for an indefinite period."

    叙报斥美国玩弄两面派把戏
    美报透露美国策划侵犯埃及主权的阴谋
    据新华社5日讯　据塔斯社大马士革4日讯：叙利亚“群众日报”发表社论说：“美国力图强使自由的阿拉伯国家接受‘艾森豪威尔主义’，玩弄两面派的把戏。这正足以说明，为什么美国一面在声明中‘呼吁’以色列撤军，一面千方百计地拖延联合国对这个问题的讨论，并且力图向以色列提供损害阿拉伯国家民族利益的保证”。
    据新华社5日讯　据塔斯社纽约4日讯：“纽约时报”记者赖斯顿在报道美国向以色列提出的撤军保证时写道，国务卿杜勒斯的建议可以归结为美国宣布要“保护通过蒂朗海峡和亚喀巴湾的美国船只”，也就是说要侵犯埃及和沙特阿拉伯的领水。赖斯顿指出，在特拉维夫人士看来，杜勒斯这些话等于指示他们，美国允许以色列随时“采取类似行动”，即以“保护以色列的主权”为名而使用武装部队。
    美联社记者谈到派遣美国军舰去红海一事报道说，美国“想单独地和集体地对埃及施加压力……”。
      “纽约先驱论坛报”记者希金斯报道说，将来“美国或者是其他某个作同样考虑的国家要提出一项提案，把联合国警察部队的作用和使命由普通的停火监察员改变为在无限长的时期内维持和平的力量”。
