The Work of the Nanchong CPPCC's Specialized Work Groups
Speech by Zhang Huixian

    This time, I am honored to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC. Please allow me to briefly report on the work of the Nanchong Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference's specialized work groups. If there is anything incorrect, please offer your criticism and correction.

    The specialized work groups of the Nanchong Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference were established in September 1956, following a decision made at the Ninth Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee. Before this, besides the Study Committee, we only had the Committee for Socialist Transformation of Capitalists and the Committee for Socialist Transformation of Agriculture and Handicrafts. With the development of the objective situation, we felt that having only these two working committees greatly limited our work and prevented the Municipal CPPCC from conducting activities in various fields more broadly with the masses.

    Nanchong City is the location of the Nanchong Prefectural Commissioner's Office and is a relatively prosperous medium-sized city in the area. It has a population of over 180,000. In terms of social relations, there are three democratic parties (the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, and the China National Democratic Construction Association), a normal college and seven regular middle schools, three cultural and artistic units, over 200 practicing doctors, business and industrial circles, religious circles, ethnic minorities (Hui people), as well as a considerable number of scientific and technological personnel and former military and government personnel and upper-middle-class old intellectuals scattered throughout society. After the great principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" was put forward, it was necessary to unite all possible forces and mobilize positive factors to serve socialism. Based on this situation, we established eight specialized work groups: Industry and Commerce, Education, Culture, Science and Technology, Medical and Health, Women, Religion and Ethnic Minorities, and Social Figures. The personnel participating in the work groups are CPPCC members and representative figures from various fields.

    Since October 1956, each specialized work group, according to its different nature and different target audience, has determined its scope of work, formulated work plans, and actively carried out work, mainly in the following aspects:

     (1) Assisting the government in continuing socialist transformation and cooperating with central tasks. For example, after the establishment of joint state-private ownership throughout the industry, the Industry and Commerce Work Group, in order to help improve the relationship between the public and private sides and ensure that those working in the industrial and commercial sectors are dutiful and responsible, often used individual contacts, collected opinions from the masses, and held forums in coordination with relevant parties, so that employees could freely express the problems existing in the public-private partnership, then exchanged views with the public side personnel, and finally invited the administrative departments, the China National Democratic Construction Association, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce to invite the public and private sides to exchange views face to face to improve relations. This approach has basically normalized the public-private relationship in Nanchong City's industrial and commercial circles, thereby encouraging their enthusiasm in the socialist labor competition. For example, when promoting patriotic savings, the Women's Work Group, in cooperation with the People's Bank, learned that some employees' families had larger incomes and smaller household expenses, and they were afraid of revealing their wealth and unwilling to save in the bank. After publicity and policy explanation, they changed their thinking. In one section of the Southeast Street Office alone, five employees' families who had never saved in the People's Bank before saved a total of 1,470 yuan at one time.

      (2) Having the work groups take up certain matters that the government and relevant departments did not have time to carry out for the time being, acting as the government's assistants. For example, former military and government personnel, former intellectuals, and family members of democratic figures scattered in society rarely participate in community learning sessions or other aspects of learning. The family members of those in the industrial and commercial circles are large in number and mostly busy with production or household chores, making it difficult to take care of them comprehensively. In order to unite all possible forces and mobilize positive factors to serve socialism, the CPPCC's Social Work Group and Women's Work Group respectively regarded them as the main targets of their work. Through investigation and understanding, individual visits, and inviting them to participate in forums or listen to reports, this has played a certain role in promoting their socialist consciousness. In the fourth quarter of last year, the Social Work Group and the Women's Work Group jointly held a report meeting, inviting the United Front Work Department of the Party Committee to give a report on issues related to the United Front work and the liberation of Taiwan, and listened to three popular science lectures, which were well received. Due to the contact with former military and government personnel, 17 people who met the organizational line of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang were introduced to the organization.

    (3) Frequently going deep among the masses, caring about the hardships of the people, understanding the opinions and demands of the people, gathering them together, analyzing and researching them, and promptly reflecting them to relevant departments, and putting forward suggestions. This is a common activity of all work groups, and the results have been particularly significant. This not only plays a supervisory role for the people over the government's work, but also prepares favorable conditions for political consultation.

    The establishment of specialized work groups is a new task. Although we have explored some directions for our work, there are still some problems, mainly: (1) The members of the work groups are mostly heads of various departments, and they hold too many concurrent positions, so they cannot spare much time to participate in the work of the work groups. At the same time, because they are the heads, the masses believe that their activities are activities of their positions, not activities of the work groups. Therefore, it is not easy to widely collect opinions from the masses; (2) The work direction of individual work groups is not clear enough, sometimes limited to group meetings with little external activity, and sometimes the work is too broad, including things that do not fall within the scope of the CPPCC's work groups. This leads to duplication of work or replacing administrative work; (3) The division of labor in individual work groups is not clear enough. Some members have nothing to do, while others are too busy to cope, failing to bring out the due role of each member, resulting in little effect.

    In response to the above problems, when summarizing the work in the fourth quarter of last year, we appropriately adjusted the members of some work groups, and also discussed and studied the work direction and scope of the work groups. At the same time, we adopted the method of vice-chairmen being responsible for specific tasks to strengthen the specific leadership of each work group. Each work group has also gradually improved various systems, and exchanged work experience and discussed relevant issues for improving the work groups through the joint meeting of group leaders.

    We hope that the higher-level CPPCC will strengthen guidance on our municipal and county CPPCC work, and we also hope that the experience of local CPPCCs at all levels in carrying out specialized work groups will be introduced regularly and systematically to promote and improve our work.

    南充政协各专门工作组的工作情况
    张恢先的发言
    这次，我荣幸地列席全国政协第二届第三次全体会议，请允许我把南充市人民政协各专门工作组的工作情况扼要地作一汇报，不对的地方，请批评指正。
    南充市人民政协各专门工作组是在1956年9月份经过常务委员会第九次扩大会议决定成立的。在这以前，我们除有学习委员会外，只有对资改造委员会和对农业手工业社会主义改造委员会。随着客观形势的发展，只有这两个工作委员会，已感到工作的局限性甚大，不能更广泛地联系群众开展市政协在各方面的活动。
    南充市是南充专署所在地，是该区比较繁荣的中等城市。人口有十八万多，就社会关系来看，有三个民主党派（民革、民盟、民建），有一个师范专科学校和七个普通中学，有三个文艺单位，有二百多个开业医生，有工商界，宗教界，少数民族（回族），还有不少的科技人员和散处在社会上的旧军政人员以及中上层旧知识分子。在“长期共存，互相监督”的伟大方针提出后，需要团结一切可能团结的力量，调动积极因素，为社会主义服务。根据这一情况，我们就成立了工商、教育、文化、科技、医卫、妇女、宗教民族、社会人士等八个专门工作组，参加工作组的人员，是政协委员以及各方面有代表性的人士。
    自1956年10月份起，各专门工作组，按照不同的性质和不同的对象，决定了工作范围，拟定了工作计划，积极开展工作，主要有以下几个方面：
     （一）协助政府继续进行社会主义改造和配合中心工作。例如全行业公私合营后，工商工作组为了协助搞好公私共事关系，使工商界从业人员做到守职尽责，通过与有关方面配合，经常以个别联系，收集群众意见和举行座谈会等方式，把公私共事关系中所存在的问题，让从业人员无顾虑地谈出来，再与公方人员交换意见，最后请行政主管部门，民建会，工商联，邀请公私双方当面交换意见，改进关系。这样作，使得南充市工商界在公私关系上基本上走向正常，从而鼓舞了他们在社会主义劳动竞赛中的积极性。又如在宣传爱国储蓄时，妇女工作组配合人民银行，了解到职工家属中，有的收入较大，家庭开支又较少，怕露富有钱，不愿向银行储蓄，经过宣传和解释政策，打通了思想，仅东南街道办事处一个段，就有五个从来未向人民银行储蓄的职工家属，一次储蓄了人民币一千四百七十元。
      （二）把政府和有关部门一时尚来不及开展工作的某些事情，由工作组搞起来，作为政府的助手。例如散处在社会上的旧军政人员、旧知识分子，以及民主人士的家属，他们参加居民段的学习就很少，也未参加其他方面的学习，工商界家属人数众多，大都忙于生产或料理家务，也不易照顾周到，为了团结一切可能团结的力量，调动积极因素来为社会主义服务，由政协社会工作组、妇女工作组分别把他们作为进行工作的主要对象，经过调查了解，个别访问，邀请他们参加座谈会或听报告，这对于促进他们的社会主义觉悟是起了一定作用的。去年第四季度，社会、妇女两工作组，曾经联合举行了一次报告会，请党委统战部作了有关统战工作问题和解放台湾问题的报告，并听了三次科普讲座，他们的反映都好。由于联系了旧军政人员并为民革介绍了符合民革组织路线的人士十七人。
    （三）经常深入群众，关心人民群众的疾苦，了解人民群众的意见和要求，集中起来经过分析研究及时向有关部门反映，并提出建议，这是各个工作组共同性的活动，收到的效果，特别显著。这不仅起到了人民群众对政府工作的监督作用，也为进行政治协商准备了有利条件。
    专门工作组的成立，是一项新的工作，我们虽然摸索出一些工作方向，但还存在着若干问题，主要是：（1）工作组的组成人员，绝大多数是一方面的负责人，他们兼职过多，分不出来好多时间来参加工作组的工作。同时，因为他们是负责人，群众认为他们的活动，就是岗位工作的活动，不认为是工作组的活动。因此，不容易广泛地搜集群众的意见；（2）个别工作组的工作方向，不够明确，有时只限于组务会议，对外活动少，有时搞的工作面过宽，不属于政协工作组的范围，也搞了起来。这样，使工作重复，或者代替了行政；（3）个别工作组，分工不够明确，有的组员无事可做，有的组员又忙不过来，未能发挥出每个组员应有的作用，致使工作效果不大。
    针对上面一些问题，在总结去年第四季度工作时，我们适当地调整了部分工作组的组成人员，也讨论和研究了工作组的工作方向和范围；同时采取了副主席分工负责的办法，来加强对各个工作组的具体领导，各工作组也逐步健全了各项制度，并通过组长联席会议，以交流工作经验，讨论改进工作组的有关问题。
    我们希望上级政协对我们市县政协工作加强指导外，并希望把各级地方政协开展专门工作组的经验，经常有系统的加以介绍，以推动和改进我们的工作。
