Combining Increased Production and Thrift with Political and Ideological Education
Increased Awareness Among Workers at Shanxi Jinsheng Textile Factory

　　(Our Report) According to the Shanxi Daily: The Shanxi Local State-owned Jinsheng Textile Factory has achieved great success in conducting political and ideological education for its workers in conjunction with the increased production and thrift campaign. The ideological awareness of the workers has been raised, many difficulties have been overcome, and many new features have emerged in their work.
　　When formulating this year's production plan, many workers at the Jinsheng Textile Factory developed incorrect ideological sentiments such as demanding better treatment, seeking enjoyment, and being unwilling to endure hardship. Many people thought that increasing production and practicing thrift was an "old trick" and that "there isn't much profit left, there's not much to do." Some leading cadres also expressed a lack of confidence in the increased production and thrift campaign.
　　In response to the above situation, the factory's Party committee, after research, decided to compile an increased production and thrift plan based on a survey of the situation. At the same time, they would conduct in-depth ideological education for the workers in conjunction with the increased production and thrift campaign. First, they conducted training for Party members and members of the Communist Youth League, criticizing erroneous ideas within the Party such as greed for enjoyment and lack of ambition for progress. Through studying Party documents, they clarified the Party's tasks during the transition period and the responsibilities that every Party member should fulfill. They specifically studied how to give play to the role of Party members and CYL members in the increased production and thrift campaign and political and ideological education. On the basis of raising the ideological understanding of Party members and CYL members and unifying ideological understanding within the Party, they carried out a comprehensive mobilization among the workers. The methods were: positive publicity, clarifying the principles. Through reports, lectures, and other forms, they explained to the workers in simple terms the relationship between the individual and the country, the individual and the collective, the relationship between immediate interests and long-term interests, the Party's tasks during the transition period, the socialist prospects, and the great responsibilities of the working class. At the same time, they publicized to the workers the new significance of this year's increased production and thrift campaign, and the principles of hard work, plain living, and running enterprises diligently and thriftily. Accounts were calculated at each level to draw clear lines of demarcation. After calculating accounts, many people clarified the relationship between production and life, distinguished which demands were reasonable, which practices were incorrect, and examined past erroneous attitudes toward the factory. After calculating accounts, many wasteful loopholes were further exposed. Recollections and comparisons were made to conduct education. In order to avoid generalizing ideological work, from the factory to the workshop, section, and team, a method of studying ideological situations at each level, solving problems at each level, and giving full play to the role of team assistance and individual talks was adopted. Some young workers, born in fortunate times, did not appreciate their blessings, so veteran workers were invited to talk about the suffering of the working class in the old society to conduct comparative education.
　　When the workers' ideological awareness was raised to some extent, the factory leadership promptly directed the workers' political enthusiasm toward increasing production and practicing thrift. According to the results of preliminary discussions, the figures for increased production and thrift throughout the year have already exceeded 200,000 yuan, and may be expanded.
　　Now, many new features have emerged in the Jinsheng Textile Factory, and the atmosphere of hard work, plain living, and diligent production among the workers has been initially established.

　　结合增产节约进行政治思想教育
　　山西晋生纺织厂职工觉悟提高
    本报讯　据山西日报消息：山西地方国营晋生纺织厂结合增产节约运动向职工进行政治思想教育，已经取得了很大成绩。职工思想觉悟提高了，许多困难克服了，工作上出现了许多新气象。
    晋生纺织厂在制定今年的生产计划时，职工群众中不少人滋长着闹待遇、闹享受、不愿艰苦等不正确的思想情绪。许多人认为增产节约是“老一套”，“油水不大了，没啥搞头了”，部分领导干部对增产节约运动也表现信心不足。
    针对上述情况，厂党委会经过研究，确定一方面在摸底的基础上编制增产节约计划，另一方面结合增产节约运动深入地向职工群众进行思想教育。他们首先进行党团员训练，批判了党内的贪图享受、不求前进等错误思想。通过学习党的文件明确党在过渡时期的任务和每一个党员应尽的责任，具体研究了在增产节约运动和政治思想教育工作中如何发挥党团员的作用。在提高党团员的思想认识，统一党团内思想认识的基础上，在职工群众中进行全面发动。办法是：正面宣传，讲清道理。通过作报告、讲课等形式，通俗的向职工讲解个人与国家、个人与集体的关系，眼前利益与长远利益的关系，党在过渡时期的任务，社会主义远景，以及工人阶级的重大责任，同时向职工宣传今年增产节约运动新的意义，和艰苦朴素、勤俭办企业的道理。层层算账，划清界限。经过算账，许多人明确了生产与生活的关系，分清了那些要求是合理的，那些做法是不对的，检查了过去对待工厂的错误态度。经过算账也进一步揭发了许多浪费漏洞。回忆对比，进行教育。为了避免思想工作的一般化，从厂到车间、工段、小组，采用了逐级研究思想情况，逐级解决问题，充分发挥小组帮助和个别谈话的作用。有些青年工人生在福中不知福，就请老工人讲旧社会工人阶级的痛苦，进行对比教育。
    当职工的思想觉悟有所提高的时候，厂领导上及时地把职工的政治热情引向增产节约。根据初步讨论的结果来看，全年增产节约的数字已经突破了二十万元，而且还可能扩大。
    现在，晋生纺织厂出现了许多新的气象，职工中艰苦朴素、勤俭生产的风气亦已初步确立。
