Using induced abortion to control fertility is inappropriate.

Kang Tongbi said: Artificial abortion or induced abortion is very harmful to the human body. It is only suitable for medical indications. It is inappropriate to use it as one of the methods to control fertility.

Under the principle of "saying everything you know and saying it without reservation," I would like to say a few words about the "induced abortion" issue today.

"Abortion" means "induced abortion," that is, interrupting pregnancy during pregnancy. Generally speaking, it can be divided into three types: the first is natural abortion, the second is induced abortion, and the third is illegal abortion. Except for the first type, which is caused by certain diseases of the mother or fetus (including habitual abortion), and occurs automatically without any external force, we will not discuss it today. The main thing I want to talk about is the second and third types of situations where artificial methods are used to forcibly interrupt pregnancy.

Pregnancy is a natural physiological phenomenon. Indeed, as Minister Li Dequan said, "Giving birth to sons and daughters is a natural physiological phenomenon of men and women getting married, and there is nothing mysterious or shameful about it." Living beings in the world must continue life, and in terms of human beings, it is through marriage and childbirth. Our goals and our socialist construction can also be said to be creating a happy future for our children and grandchildren. A new life is created from the moment of conception. The name of this new life should also be "person."

Pregnancy is a normal physiological phenomenon, and it is a beneficial physiological process for women. Under normal conditions, pregnancy has a beneficial impact on the pregnant woman's body, promoting further development and enabling the body's organs to fully perform their functions. In other words, during pregnancy, there are definitely considerable and beneficial changes in a woman's physiology and psychology.

Violating this normal physiological phenomenon will cause some harm, even disability or loss of life. I am not a medical expert, and there may be deficiencies or errors in explaining this issue. I hope experts can correct me.

In some special cases, pregnancy is not suitable because it threatens the pregnant woman's life or directly damages her health. Thus, the laws in general countries stipulate that artificial abortion is allowed, which is also called "medical indication" abortion. For example, the resolution of the Central Executive Committee and the People's Committee of the Soviet Union on June 27, 1936, stipulated that artificial abortion could be allowed under certain circumstances; otherwise, any excuse would be illegal, harmful to a free person, and should not be allowed.

According to medical principles, diseases that require artificial abortion include various stubborn heart and vascular diseases, edema, stagnation of internal organ blood circulation, high blood pressure, stubborn inflammation, kidney disease, open pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculosis poisoning, tuberculosis of the urinary organs, peritoneum, intestines, bones and joints, and larynx, liver disease, endocrine gland disease, malignant anemia, leukemia, tumors, epilepsy, excessively narrow pelvis, deafness, dumbness, mental illness, and all diseases that may worsen during pregnancy. These are the so-called medical indications or indications for artificial abortion. These artificial abortions are necessary measures to protect women's health and lives and to prevent all dangers that may occur in various diseases unsuitable for pregnancy and childbirth. Although other diseases may be caused by performing artificial abortion surgery, it is still beneficial in comparison.

Normal childbirth is a natural phenomenon of ripening. Abortion, however, is too harmful to the human body, mainly due to complications. Sometimes complications start after a certain period of time. Therefore, some women who have undergone abortion do not feel anything wrong at first, and do not believe that abortion will cause harm. However, after a period of time, her body will show serious obstacles, which sometimes start suddenly and manifest as difficult-to-cure or neurological symptoms. At that time, regret will be too late and irreparable.

Artificial abortion sounds simple, and the Western medical term is "curettage." However, in reality, it is to peel the fertilized egg alive from the uterine wall, sever countless blood vessels, and separate flesh from flesh. This surgical operation is quite complex and meticulous, and most of it is done blindly by groping with instruments. Blood vessels cannot be ligated, and the surface of the wound cannot be protected. The blood is allowed to flow, and the wound surface is exposed. Comrades, think about it, what kind of phenomenon is this? How scary?

In addition to this phenomenon, the most serious complications are uterine trauma and uterine perforation, which are very terrible and dangerous diseases; at the same time, there are also injuries or inflammations of the pelvic and abdominal organs.

"Infection" is the secondary complication. Local inflammation and blood poisoning are not uncommon. Autogenous infection and the invasion of external germs can occur at any time, and the mortality rate is also particularly high; moreover, even if it is not detected immediately, it is likely to become a "latent focus," causing endless hidden worries in the future.

"Bleeding," as I said earlier, those blood vessels that cannot be ligated are allowed to flow, and even with uterine contraction agents and hemostatic agents, it is only a last resort. If a patient has hemophilia or blood loss allergy, we can only watch her die.

Other symptoms include physiological dysfunction, endocrine disorders, neurological diseases, decreased libido, premature aging, uterine adhesions, stubborn pain, reduced labor capacity, menstrual disorders, mental irritability, insomnia, nightmares, and other various symptoms. If a woman has already had a curettage and then becomes pregnant or has another curettage, it is even more unimaginable. The uterus is scarred all over, and the muscles lose their ability to contract. I really don't know how to describe it.

Most of the situations mentioned above occur in urban hospitals. Many experienced doctors and experts are present today. I ask, can we completely guarantee avoiding the above complications when performing artificial abortion surgery in the best environment at present? I think it's impossible. In rural areas, when midwives or quack doctors without any scientific knowledge are in charge, it can be said in an old saying, "They treat human life like dirt." I have personally seen and heard about deaths caused by abortion. The stories are too tragic to describe.

Since artificial abortion has so many disadvantages, what should we do? Turn a blind eye? Or strictly prohibit it by law? To control the population and regulate fertility in a planned way is a progressive measure. It is correct to use scientific methods to control pregnancy in a planned way. However, it is inappropriate to use artificial abortion or "induced abortion" to regulate fertility. It is like drinking poison to quench thirst, innocently killing people to control fertility, which is problematic.

The "fetus" already has the qualifications to be a human being, and it has the right to "live." We cannot innocently deprive anyone of the right to "live," let alone kill both the mother and the child? We should be more cautious.

In 1936, the Soviet Union changed the decree on allowing abortion promulgated on November 18, 1920, and made strict regulations on abortion in Articles 140 and 141 of their Criminal Code. This is our example. A few days ago, the People's Daily editorial said that the State Council approved the Ministry of Health's regulations on artificial abortion in 1953. I don't know whether the recent spread of artificial abortion is based on these regulations, but I think the government's permission for pregnant women to have artificial abortion is for women with special diseases that prevent them from giving birth, or for mothers whose lives are endangered by childbirth, not for all pregnant women to have artificial abortion. People should not misunderstand the government's meaning. My personal opinion is that "using artificial abortion to control fertility is unscientific" and harmful to women's bodies. Fertility control should start from "no fetus." Once there is a fetus, the fetus has the right to "live" and should be raised. Women comrades across the country should also give play to their maternal instinct to protect themselves, protect their children, and do their best to practice contraception and birth control.

Finally, I would like to make the following suggestions to the conference:

First, I request the government to vigorously promote contraception and birth control to prevent abortion.

Second, I request the government to widely establish women's consultation centers to assist women in solving all their health and pregnancy-related problems.

Third, I request the Ministry of Health to strictly enforce the artificial abortion regulations, which should only be applicable to medical indications and not have other excuses.

Fourth, if possible, I request that the marriage age be postponed to reduce blind childbearing among young people and to have more time to focus on learning and research.

In order for our country to get rid of poverty and achieve prosperity and strength more quickly, we must control the population in a planned way; however, artificial abortion can never be used as one of the methods.

### 用人工流产来节制生育是不适当的

    用人工流产来节制生育是不适当的
    康同璧说：人工流产或打胎对于人体的害处很大，它只适用于医学适应症，把它作为节制生育的方法之一，是不恰当的。
    在“知无不言，言无不尽”的原则下，我今天想就“人工流产”问题，说几句话。
    “流产”的意思就是“堕胎”，也就是说在怀孕期间，使妊娠中断。一般地说起来，可以分为三种：第一种是自然流产，第二是人工流产，第三是违法堕胎。除去第一种是因为母亲或胎儿的某一些疾病（包括习惯性流产），不经过任何外力作用，而自动发生的流产现象，我们今天不谈。主要的我想说一说第二和第三类的用人工方法来强迫妊娠中断的情况。
    怀孕是一种自然的生理现象，诚然如李德全部长所说的“生男育女是男女结婚的自然生理现象，没有什么可神秘与可羞的”。世界上有生物，必然是要把生命继续下去，在人类方面，便是通过了结婚、生育。我们所奋斗的目标，我们的社会主义建设，也可以说，都是为了子孙们而创造幸福的远景。从受胎的时候起便产生了一个新的生命。这个新的生命的名称，也应该是“人”。
    怀孕是正常的生理现象，对于妇女来说，是一种有利的生理过程，在一般条件下，妊娠对于孕妇的全身起着有利的影响，能够促使进一步发育，能够影响全身的器官，充分发挥其机能。换句话说，妊娠期间，对于妇女的生理与心理，都肯定地有着相当和有利的变化。
    违反了这种正常的生理现象，便会产生一些危害，甚至残废或丧失生命。我不是医学专家，可能在说明这一个问题时，有不到的地方或是有些错误。希望各位专家们能够给我改正。
    在某一些特殊的情况下，妊娠是不适宜的，它会威胁孕妇的生命或直接损害孕妇的健康。这样，在一般国家里的法律上，规定了允许人工流产，这也叫做“医学适应症”的流产。例如苏联在1936年6月27日苏联中央执行委员会及人民委员会的决议，规定了在某种情况下，是可以允许人工流产的执行，否则，任何借口，都是非法的，都是对于一个自由的人身有伤害的，是不应该允许的。
    根据医学上的原则，必须行使人工流产的病症，例如各种顽固的心脏和血管重症，有浮肿现象，内分脏的血液循环停滞，血压太高，顽固的炎症，肾脏病，开放性的肺结核病，结核中毒，泌尿器官，腹膜，肠管，骨关节以及喉部的结核，肝脏疾病，内分泌腺疾病，恶性贫血，白血病，毒瘤，癫痫，骨盆过分狭窄，聋哑，精神病，以及一切凡是在妊娠期内可能恶化的病症，都是所谓医学适应症，或是人工流产适应症。这些人工流产，是为了保护妇女的健康及生命，防止在各种不适于妊娠及分娩的疾病时所能发生的一切危险，而必须采取的手段。虽然可能由于施行人工流产手术，而引致其他疾病，可是，比较起来，还是有利的。
    正常的生产是瓜熟蒂落的现象。流产，则对于人体的害处太大。主要的是由于并发症。有的时候并发症是经过一定的时间才开始。所以有些经过流产的妇女，开始时并不感到有什么不好，也不相信流产会给人带来害处。可是，经过了一段时期，她的身体就会显现出严重的障碍，这种障碍有时是突然开始，而表现为不容易治愈或神经性的症候。那时，懊悔就晚了，而且是无法补偿的。
    人工流产说起来很简单，在西医的名词就是“刮宫”。可是，实际上是把受胎的卵，活生生地从子宫壁上剥离下来，把无数的血管摘断，把肉从肉上分开。这种手术操作是相当复杂细致的，大部分是目力所看不到而仅凭器械的摸索。血管不能包扎，创伤的表面无法保护。血，只好听它流，创伤面只好这么裸露着。同志们，想想看，这是一种什么现象？多么可怕？
    除去这个现象之外，并发症中最严重的是子宫创伤和子宫穿孔，这是很可怕而且也很危险的病症；同时，还有骨盆内和腹腔内脏器的损伤或炎症。
    “感染”，是次一级的并发症。局部炎症和血中毒，并不少见，自体感染和外面的病菌侵入，随时可能发生，死亡率也特别大；还有，纵然不立即发现，这里很可能成为“潜伏病灶”，给将来以无穷的隐忧。
    “出血”，刚才已经说过，那些不能包扎的血管，只好任它流，就是用子宫收缩剂和止血剂，也只是挽救万一而已。倘若遇上血友病，或是失血过敏症时，那只好眼看着她去死。
    其他还有生理机能紊乱，内分泌障碍，神经性病患，性欲减退，未老先衰，子宫粘连，顽固性的疼痛，劳动力减低，月经不调，精神烦躁，失眠，恶梦，等等各种不同的症象。如果是已经做过刮宫的妇女，再行怀孕或刮宫，那是更不堪设想的了。子宫内瘢痕斑斑，肌肉失去伸缩的能力，我实在不知道怎么样来描述。
    前面所说的一些情况，大部分是在城市里的医院中所动的手术。很多有经验的大夫专家们现在在座，请问作人工流产手术，在目前最好的环境下，是不是能完全保证避免上面的这些并发症呢？我想是不可能吧。农村里，经那些没有任何科学常识的收生婆或庸医来主持，那很可以用一句古话来说，“草菅人命”。我曾亲眼看见和亲耳听见过有堕胎致死的事情。故事是太惨了，用不到去描述。
    既然人工流产有这么些坏处，我们应该怎么样呢？熟视无睹呢？还是法律严禁呢？为了有计划地控制人口而节制生育，这是一种进步的措施，用科学方法来作有计划的控制怀孕，这是正确的，不过，用人工流产或是“打胎”来节制生育，这是不恰当的。饮鸩止渴，无辜地杀人以节制生育，这是有问题的。
    “胎”已经具备了做人的资格，它有“生”的权利，我们不能无辜地剥夺任何一个人的“生”的权利。更何况是既杀其母，又杀其子呢？我们应该审慎一点。
    苏联在1936年更改了1920年11月18日所颁布的许可堕胎的法令，更在他们的刑法第一四○、一四一条条文中作了对于堕胎的严格规定。这是我们的范例。前几天人民日报的社论里曾说国务院在1953年批准卫生部对于人工流产的规定，我不知道近来人工流产情况的蔓延是不是根据条例而作的，但我想政府所以许可孕妇人工流产者是对于有特殊病症不能生育之妇女、生育即有碍其生命的母亲，而不是许可普遍孕妇皆能人工流产的。人们不要误会政府的意思。我个人的意见是“用人工流产办法来节制生育，是不科学的”，是对妇女们的身体有伤害的。节制生育应该从“无胎”做起，既已有胎，胎有“生”的权利，就应该把它养下来。全国的妇女同志也应该发挥母性来保护自己，保护孩子，尽力节育避孕。
    最后，我向大会建议：
    第一，请求政府大力推广避孕，节育，以防止有胎而被堕。
    第二，请求政府广泛设立妇女咨询所，以协助妇女们解决她们一切有关卫生和孕产的问题。
    第三，请求卫生部将人工流产条例严格一下，只能适用医学适应症，不能有其他借口。
    第四，如果可能，请求将结婚年龄推迟，以减少年轻的孩子们盲目生育，多有几年功夫专心致力于学习和研究。
    为了使我们国家能够更快的摆脱贫困，达到繁荣富强，我们必须要有计划地控制人口；可是，人工流产决不可能被引用为方法之一。
