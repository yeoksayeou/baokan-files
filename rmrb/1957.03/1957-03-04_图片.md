    Fatumei, the director of the ethnic women's clothing production cooperative in Lanzhou, Gansu Province, is a capable Hui woman. She used to be a housewife, but after joining the cooperative, she actively studied and worked diligently. In 1953, she was elected as the deputy director of the cooperative. Later, her work ability continued to improve, and the cooperative expanded from fifty or sixty people when it was established in 1951 to more than a hundred people (including five ethnic groups: Hui, Han, Uyghur, Salar, and Dongxiang); the number of sewing machines increased from four to eighty-seven; the business developed from mainly engaging in embroidery and small handicrafts to sewing clothing for various ethnic groups; and two stores were opened. Fatumei was then elected as the director of the cooperative with a unanimous vote. At the same time, she is also an executive committee member of the Gansu Provincial and Lanzhou Municipal Democratic Women's Federation and a member of the Gansu Provincial Ethnic Affairs Commission.

    甘肃省兰州市的民族妇女服装生产合作社的社主任法图麦，是一个能干的回族妇女。她从前是一个家庭妇女，入社后由于她积极学习，刻苦钻研，1953年被选为社的副主任。后来她的工作能力不断提高，合作社也由1951年成立时的五、六十人扩大到百余人了（包括五个民族：回、汉、维吾尔、撒拉、东乡）；由四台缝纫机增加到八十七台；由主要经营刺绣和小件手工制品发展到缝制各民族服装了；并且开设了两个门市部。法图麦又以全票选为社主任。同时她还是甘肃省和兰州市民主妇女联合会的执行委员，甘肃省民族事务委员会委员。
