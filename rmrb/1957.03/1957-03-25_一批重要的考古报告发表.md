Publication of a Batch of Important Archaeological Reports

　　Nineteen specialized reports on important archaeological surveys and excavations will be published in the first issue of the Archaeological Journal this year.

　　These specialized reports are part of the twenty-six specialized reports presented at the First National Archaeological Work Conference in February last year. They reflect the significant achievements in China's archaeological work in recent years and provide new materials for the study of ancient Chinese history.

　　Nine of the reports are about the investigation and excavation of sites, introducing the unearthed cultural relics and sites of the Neolithic Age, Yin Dynasty, Warring States period, and Han Dynasty in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Anhui, Fujian, Jilin, Zhengzhou, Hebei, Liaoyang, and other places. The area near Lanzhou is a relatively rich and complex area for the remains of painted pottery in China. The report provides a concise analysis of the painted pottery unearthed from several typical sites, kiln sites, and tombs, giving a clearer picture of the Neolithic culture near Lanzhou. Microliths are a self-contained cultural system north of the Great Wall in China, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is a rich producing area of this culture. The report introduces several sites and unearthed microliths and other objects in this area. The Anhui region includes the Huai River and Yangtze River basins. The Neolithic cultures in the Huai River and Yangtze River areas are quite different. The report summarizes the survey materials in recent years and compares the characteristics and interconnections of the cultures in the two regions. The Neolithic relics unearthed in Guangze and Changting, Fujian, are characterized by impressed pottery and stepped adzes. The Changting Hetian report makes a tentative analysis of the shape of stepped adzes. The stone coffin tombs in the Jiangbei Tuchengzi site in Jilin are made of irregular stones. Each stone coffin is placed with pig teeth as funerary objects, which can reflect the regional burial system and customs.

　　The Yin Dynasty was a period when ancient Chinese culture entered a brilliant stage. The special topic includes an excavation report of the Yin Dynasty cultural site in Zhengzhou. Recent excavations have unearthed house foundations, copper smelting sites, pottery making sites, bone tool making sites, cellars, tombs, etc. The relics include bronze ware, pottery, bone ware, oracle bones, etc., which are important discoveries following Xiaotun. The report provides a phased explanation of the Erligang and People's Park sites. The excavation of the Warring States site in Shijiazhuang unearthed Zhao state coins and iron farm tools, which is important for studying the culture of the Zhao state at that time. The Western Han village site in Sandaohao, Liaoyang, unearthed the foundations of farmers' and potters' houses, wells, livestock pens, earth cellars, stone-paved roads, and iron production tools. From the accumulation of fertilizer in every household, the use of pottery mills to process grains, and well-building technology, it shows that agriculture and pottery industry were very advanced at that time. From the unearthed stone-paved roads, vehicles, and horse bones, it can be seen that transportation was also very developed.

　　Ten reports are related to the excavation of ancient tombs, ranging in age from the Western Zhou to the Six Dynasties, and the regions include Chang'an, Changsha, Shanxi, Shandong, Guangzhou, Zhejiang, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Luoyang, Nanjing, and other places. A large number of bronze wares were unearthed from the Western Zhou tombs in Pudu Village, Chang'an, all with more inscriptions. Some of them are from the era of King Mu of Zhou, adding newly unearthed materials for the dating of Western Zhou bronze wares. The Chu wooden coffin tombs in Changsha preserve a complete wooden coffin burial system. The unearthed bamboo slips, wooden figurines, carved panels, and writing brushes are extremely precious; especially the unearthed writing brushes advance the date of their invention by nine hundred years. A large amount of human brain marrow and optic nerves were preserved in the tomb, which is a major discovery. A large number of bronze wares, pottery, lacquer wares, etc. were unearthed from the Warring States and Western Han ancient tombs in Fenshuiling, Changzhi, Shanxi. Among them, chime stones, bronze figures, pottery figures, and lacquer paintings on pottery are rare artistic productions.

　　Han tombs are very common in various parts of the country. However, the Han tombs in this report each have their own characteristics. For example, Han tombs in Shandong are originally known for their stone carvings, but a large number of lacquer wares are preserved in the Han tombs in Wendeng County, which is the first time that lacquer wares have been unearthed in Han tombs in Shandong. The Eastern Han wooden coffin tomb in Longshenggang, Guangzhou, unearthed a wooden boat model and a lacquer shield painted with a pig-headed human body, which are also rare; especially the wooden coffin structure is divided into two levels in the front and rear, two layers in the upper and lower, and left and right chambers. The coffin mouth is sealed with wooden pillars, which already has the meaning of a brick chamber structure. In the Han tombs in Lizhu, Shaoxing, geometric impressed hard pottery and glazed pottery were unearthed, indicating that impressed hard pottery was still popular in Lizhu during the Han Dynasty, and glazed pottery also grew. In addition, the Han tombs unearthed in Guixian, Guangxi and Nanchang, Jiangxi, also illustrate the Han Dynasty remains in the region.

　　The two reports on the tombs of the Six Dynasties, one unearthed in Luoyang, the capital of the Western Jin Dynasty, and the other unearthed in Nanjing, the misty and romantic capital of the Six Dynasties, were both concentrated areas of the feudal cliques at that time. The Jin tombs in Luoyang have long tomb passages. The unearthed epitaphs can be used for accurate dating and show the extravagance of the Western Jin Dynasty's nobles and the poverty of the working people. In the tombs of the Six Dynasties in Nanjing, the celadon has piled-up patterns and imitates animal shapes, which is an innovation in production. Especially the discovery of the celadon tiger of Wu Chiwu fourteen years advances the history of Chinese celadon for a period of time.

　　一批重要的考古报告发表
　　十九篇重要的考古调查、发掘的专题报告，将在本年第一期考古学报上刊出。
    这些专题报告是去年2月第一次全国考古工作会议上所宣读的二十六篇专题报告中的一部分，他们反映了我国近年来考古事业上的重大成就，对研究我国古代史提供了新的材料。
    有九篇报告是关于遗址的调查和发掘的，他们介绍了内蒙古自治区、安徽、福建、吉林、郑州、河北、辽阳等地的新石器时代、殷代、战国、汉代的文化遗址、遗物的出土情况。兰州附近是我国彩陶遗存比较丰富而又复杂的地区，报告中把若干典型的遗址、窑址、墓葬所出土的彩陶，作了扼要的分析，给了解兰州附近的新石器时代文化以更为清楚的轮廓。细石器是我国长城以北的自成体系的一种文化，内蒙古自治区便是这种文化的丰富产地，报告中对该处的遗址与出土的细石器等物作了若干介绍。安徽地区包括了淮河长江两大流域，淮河区与长江区的新石器时代文化颇有区别，报告中综合了近年的调查材料，比较了两区文化的特点及其相互联系。福建光泽与长汀出土的新石器时代遗物，以印纹陶与有段石?为其特征，长汀河田报告中，对有段石?的形制作了试探性的分析。吉林江北土城子遗址中的石棺墓，是用大小不整齐的石块砌成的，每座石棺上都放置着猪牙为殉，可以从中看出地区性的葬制及其风尚。
    殷代是我国古代文化进入绚灿的阶段。专题中有郑州殷代文化遗址的发掘报告，近年发掘，出土房基、炼铜场所、制陶场所、制骨器场所、窖穴、墓葬等，遗物有铜器、陶器、骨器、卜骨等，是继小屯以后的重要发现。报告就二里岗与人民公园二处，作了分期的说明。石家庄战国遗址的发掘，出土赵国钱币及铁农具，对研究当时赵国的文化是重要的。辽阳三道壕的西汉村落遗址，出土农户及窑户的房基、水井、畜栏、土窖、石铺大路及铁质生产工具。从家家积肥，用陶磨加工谷物和造井技术等来看，说明了当时的农业及窑业均很进步；又从石铺大路及车器马骨的出土，看出了交通运输也很发达。
    有十篇报告有关古墓葬的发掘的，其时代自西周以至六朝，其地区包括长安、长沙、山西、山东、广州、浙江、广西、江西、洛阳、南京等处。长安普渡村的西周墓葬，出土大批铜器，均有较多的铭文，有些是周穆王时代的，给西周铜器断代上增添了新出土的资料。长沙的楚木椁墓，保存了完整的木椁葬制，出土的竹简、木俑、雕花板、毛笔等物均极珍贵；尤以毛笔出土，将它的发明年代提早了九百年。墓中保存了大量的人脑髓与视觉神经，是一重大发现。山西长治分水岭出土战国及西汉古墓，有大批铜器、陶器、漆器等物，其中编磬、铜人、陶人及陶器上漆绘纹饰，都是少见的艺术制作。
    汉墓在全国各地出土本极平常。这次报告中的汉墓，却各具它的特点。如山东汉墓原以石刻为著，而文登县汉墓中却保存大量漆器，漆器出土于山东汉墓中尚属首次。广州龙生岗的东汉木椁墓，出土木船模型和绘豕首人身的漆盾，也是少见的；尤以木椁结构，分前后两级、上下两层、左右两室，椁口用木柱封门，已具备着砖室结构的意味了。绍兴漓渚汉墓中，出土几何形印纹硬陶与釉陶，说明了漓渚在汉代印纹硬陶尚为盛行，同时釉陶也成长了。此外广西贵县及江西南昌等地出土的汉墓，也说明了该地区的汉代遗存情况。
    六朝墓葬，报告中的两篇，一为西晋都地洛阳出土，一为六朝烟粉的南京出土，都是当时封建大集团的集中地。洛阳晋墓有长大的墓道，出土墓志可资确切断代，并看出了西晋公卿世族的豪侈及劳动人民的贫苦。南京六朝墓中，青瓷有堆塑纹饰并仿动物造型，在制作上是一革新，尤以吴赤乌十四年的青瓷虎子的发现，把我国青瓷历史提前了一段时间。
