Agricultural Cooperatives Have Tremendous Power to Increase Production
　　Wang Guanlan Discusses Production Increases Before and After Guangdong's "Red Flag Cooperative"
　　I fully support Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference and the reports by Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Li. I also agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC and wholeheartedly support Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech on increasing production and practicing economy. Now, I will only offer some opinions on rural issues.

　　Last year was the first year that China achieved a great victory in socialist transformation, and also the first year that fundamental changes took place in rural relations of production. I went to the countryside twice to inspect, wanting to gain some basic knowledge from the actual transformations and from the masses. The first time I went to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces in April and May, which was the season for spring plowing and rice transplanting. The second time I went to Hunan and Guangdong in November and December, which was after the autumn harvest, when agricultural cooperatives were busy with distribution and settlement. Neither of the two inspections was very long, but the impressions were very deep, and the educational significance was also great. At the same time, I felt that my knowledge was too little. Learning in the face of the rapid development of practical things is rich, colorful, and endless. After seeing more than ten different types of agricultural cooperatives, especially after seeing the "Red Flag Cooperative," I was deeply moved and deeply felt that after being organized, the power is very magnificent. If everyone can hold the determination to run the cooperative well, fully exert the collective strength, exert everyone's experience, wisdom and skills, and mobilize all positive factors to develop production, it has unparalleled superiority. In fact, people want to realize their noble ideals, overcome nature, transform nature, and live a happy and joyful life, only by resolutely supporting this transformation and realizing an important link in the socialist system—the socialist transformation of agriculture. Now I will talk to you about the development of the "Red Flag Cooperative."

　　I. The Past and Present of the "Red Flag Cooperative"

　　The "Red Flag Cooperative" is an agricultural production cooperative organized by the working farmers of Haizhong Township, Nanhai County, Guangdong Province, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government. 97% of the farmers in Haizhong Township have joined the "Red Flag Cooperative." The township used to be a poor village. The entire township of 295 households had only one water buffalo. The more than 2,400 mu of paddy fields had to be tilled with old hoes or plowed by manpower. It was often plagued by floods, and the harvest was very unstable. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, after the burning, killing, and looting by the Japanese invaders, some of the tiled houses became dilapidated thatched huts that did not protect from the wind and rain. After the end of the War of Resistance, the Kuomintang added some more poverty to this place. But at the same time, it also brought a benefit: the people in these difficult years developed a strong and unswerving revolutionary will. After liberation, after the land reform, in 1954, on the basis of mutual aid teams, the "Red Flag" and "Hongmian" primary agricultural production cooperatives were established. In the first wave of the socialist revolution upsurge after the autumn of 1955, the two primary cooperatives were merged and 174 individual households were absorbed; it was expanded into the current advanced cooperative with 286 households and 1,108 people. After a year of testing in 1956, the cooperative's achievements are not only a glorious banner of Nanhai County, a glorious banner of Guangdong Province, but also a bright and splendid banner of the People's Republic of China in the cause of socialist transformation of agriculture! It has increased the yield of land, reaching 1,025 jin per mu, surpassing the struggle target indicated in the draft National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. Pigs, chickens, ducks, geese, and other domestic animals and poultry have been bred and grown in large numbers, supplying the needs of the country and meeting the demands of the cooperative members, making the cooperative members happily full of confidence in their lives, the development prospects of the cooperative, and the bright future of the country. After a year of hard work, it achieved a bumper harvest in normal years, won the red flag of the first 1,000-jin mu in Nanhai County, and obtained a total agricultural and sideline production value of 36,778,996 yuan for the whole cooperative throughout the year (including the household sideline occupations of the cooperative members), an increase of 56.13% compared with 1955. In addition to paying more than 490,000 jin of public grain, selling more than 1,050,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, leaving expenses for expanding reproduction in the coming year, repaying overdue loans in excess, and leaving public accumulation funds and public welfare funds, the public property of the cooperative has been greatly expanded—32 head of cattle, 145 small boats, one water pump, pig, goose, and duck sheds, and farm implements worth 15,500 yuan, and a large amount of other working capital. The income of cooperative members has also been generally increased, and the lives of cooperative members have been greatly improved. It has attracted nine farmers in the township who were determined to continue working individually, and they have also begun to waver. Even Liang Di, a middle peasant who took the lead in withdrawing from the cooperative and did not work for forty days, has become firm and become an activist in connecting others to join the cooperative.

　　II. All-round Development of Production, with Average Yield per Mu Exceeding 1,000 Jin in the Whole Cooperative

　　Under the correct management policy, the "Red Flag Cooperative" has made full use of all favorable conditions, grasped the multi-business operation with increased grain production as the mainstay, and made agricultural and sideline industries organically cooperate and support each other. It has rationally solved the relationship between public and private economy, appropriately arranged division of labor and work assignments, and exerted the initiative and creativity of the cooperative members. On the basis of the high enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of the members, it has comprehensively developed production. 1956 was originally a normal year, not particularly favorable weather conditions. Other natural conditions, the "Red Flag Cooperative" compared with the surrounding areas and townships, also did not seem special. However, the "Red Flag Cooperative" has achieved an all-round bumper harvest of crops and achieved amazing results.

　　Rice: The average yield per mu of more than 2,200 mu of paddy fields in the entire cooperative reached 1,025 jin (winter wheat not included), an increase of 42.36% compared with the yield of 720 jin per mu in 1955, which was 80% of a normal year. The measures to increase production, in addition to basically solving the problem of water conservancy, vigorously accumulating and making fertilizer, changing to improved varieties, changing the farming system, and carrying out small-plant and single-plant close planting, have achieved good results. In particular, transforming low-yield fields and raising waterlogged fields has increased the yield of 500 mu of acidic paddy fields from 500-600 jin per mu to 900-1,000 jin, which alone increased 200,000 jin of rice.

　　Cash crops: Arrowhead, straw mushrooms, water chestnuts, melons, and vegetables have also increased their yields and output value, making the annual total reach more than 65,000 yuan, accounting for 24.46% of the total agricultural income of 267,980 yuan.

　　The development of the breeding industry is also very considerable. In 1955, there were only 19 sows, which increased to 49 in 1956, and 2 boars and 450 meat pigs were added, totaling 501. In 1955, there were 385 mother ducks, which increased to more than 800 in 1956. Chickens and geese have also increased significantly. Cattle have increased from one or three heads to thirty-two heads. In addition, the fish produced in the 56 mu of fish ponds has also supplied the needs of the state and the cooperative members.

　　The "Red Flag Cooperative" raises domestic animals and poultry. In addition to supplying the needs of the cooperative, it also takes the breeding as the mainstay and helps cooperative members with piglet and duckling breeding in large quantities to develop household sideline occupations. According to existing materials, as of September last year, the 286 cooperative members raised a total of 428 pigs and sold another 210, with an average of 2.2 pigs per household in the entire township. They raised 8,750 chickens, an average of 30 per household. They raised 6,800 ducks, an average of 24 per household. The cooperative took a positive attitude to support and help solve the difficulties of cooperative members in piglet and duckling breeding in a planned way.

　　Here, I would like to talk specifically about the issue of pig raising: the "Red Flag Cooperative" has valuable experience in pig raising. In 1956, more than 500 pigs were raised, all without using grain feed, only using fermented water hyacinth (when there is no water hyacinth in winter, sow thistle or other vegetables can be used as fermented feed) and madder and other green feed to feed them. The pigs love to eat and grow fast. The feed is not cooked, which saves effort and firewood. The specific calculation is: each pig only needs six jin of fermented green feed plus one jin of bran (sows eat fine bran, piglets can add some broken rice) and one jin of distiller's grains water per day. On average, each pig is raised to 160 jin, only using 320 jin of bran and 480 jin of distiller's grains water. The cost is very low, and the profit is very large. According to last year's price calculation, each pig can earn a net profit of more than 40 yuan.

　　III. Cooperative Members' Incomes Generally Increased, and Living Standards Greatly Improved

　　On the basis of all-round development of production, the incomes of cooperative members have generally increased. The value of each labor day obtained by each member from the cooperative is 1.41 yuan. On average, each cooperative member's household can earn 801 yuan per year, including household sideline occupations, which has exceeded the average annual income level of 650 yuan per household of middle peasants before the establishment of the cooperative. The wealthy middle peasants have also exceeded their past average level. The nine upper-middle peasant households with the highest income in the past in the entire township had an average net income of 894 yuan per household in 1953, which increased to an average of 1,168 yuan per household in 1956, an increase of 30%. Take the two old upper-middle peasant households Liang Guo and Liang Rong, who had the highest income in the past in the entire township, as examples. Liang Guo's family of six, with two laborers, had more than ten mu of land in the past, with an average yield of 850 jin per mu, earning 714 yuan; 0.8 mu of vegetable land, earning 240 yuan; 0.5 mu of dry land, earning 100 yuan; raising eight pigs a year, earning 480 yuan; selling piglets, earning 50 yuan; poultry, earning 150 yuan. The total income was 1,734 yuan. After deducting costs and paying public grain, the net income was 1,008 yuan. In 1956, his family worked 637 labor days, earning 898 yuan in labor remuneration; the income from the private plot was 100 yuan; raising seven pigs a year, earning 530 yuan; poultry, earning 270 yuan. After deducting costs and paying public grain, the net income was 1,330 yuan, an increase of 322 yuan compared with 1953. Another upper-middle peasant household, Liang Rong, had a total income of about 1,200 yuan in 1953 (excluding costs). After joining the cooperative, because there were six laborers working, they worked 1,300 labor days, earning 1,833 yuan in labor remuneration, plus household sideline occupations, the annual income was 2,685 yuan, an increase of 100% compared with the income in 1953. These materials can fully explain the basic reason why the upper-middle peasants stopped wavering and did not want to withdraw from the cooperative.

　　Due to the increase in income, the lives of the cooperative members have been greatly improved. In 1955, the poor and lower-middle peasants who could not use up their oil coupons, sugar coupons, and cloth coupons have already felt that they are not enough. Many of those who used to smoke grass now smoke cigarettes. Those who used to smoke ×× brand cigarettes at 1.44 yuan a pack now want to smoke ×× brand cigarettes at 1.9 yuan a pack. Clothing and utensils are also being replenished in large quantities. Some even want to make two sets of new clothes and buy a new hat for each adult and child. Some have also changed their past habits and are wearing shoes to work in the fields. Liang Sen, a new middle peasant's family of nine, bought more than 60 jin of sugar coupons a year and said it was not enough! The cooperative members' demand for culture is also urgent. Several folk schools in the township are holding classes at night. And that primary school with more than 300 students is preparing to further improve and enrich itself. In short, after the "Red Flag Cooperative" became advanced, in the first year of implementing the policy of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily, it greatly changed its original appearance in production, life, and people's spirit.

　　Thus, the conclusion can be drawn that through last year's collective labor, the production and living standards have exceeded the average level of the middle peasants in the past. Therefore, they have higher enthusiasm and greater confidence. At the general meeting of all cooperative members, everyone unanimously approved the production plan for 1957. The production increase targets are as follows:

　　Collective aspects:

　　Rice: The average yield per mu is 1,100 jin, an increase of 75 jin compared with last year.

　　The total output value of cash crops increased by 121% compared with last year.

　　Breeding industry: Pigs will be developed to 1,200 heads, an increase of 699 heads compared with last year. Ducks and chickens will be developed to 19,250, an increase of 8,320 compared with last year. The total output value of the breeding industry will increase by 284% compared with last year.

　　The collective sideline business increased by 65.5% compared with last year.

　　Cooperative members' household sideline occupations:

　　Raise 1,440 pigs, an average of five pigs per household per year.

　　Raise chickens: an average of 50 per household, an increase of 33% compared with last year.

　　Raise ducks: an average of 30 per household, an increase of 25% compared with last year.

　　Raise geese: an average of 10 per household, an increase of 43% compared with last year.

　　According to this production increase target, the value of each labor day in 1957 can reach 2 yuan. Including household sideline occupations, the average net income of each cooperative member's household can reach 1,178 yuan, an increase of 56.65% compared with 1956. This level is already incomparable to that of the middle peasants in the past.

　　Here, I believe with full confidence that under the leadership of the Communist Party, and through the efforts of all cooperative members, the "Red Flag Cooperative" will definitely achieve greater results in agricultural and sideline production this year than last year.

　　IV. Exchange Advanced Experience, Improve Work, and Realize a Great Agricultural Harvest in 1957

　　The "Red Flag Cooperative" is a good cooperative in Nanhai County, and also a good cooperative in Guangdong Province. It is said that there are about 200 cooperatives like the "Red Flag Cooperative" that have been found in various parts of Guangdong Province in the first batch. This is the glory of the broad masses of Guangdong Province. However, the history of universal cooperative establishment in Guangdong Province is not the longest. Like many places in the country, it has only been a little over a year. Of course, there are good cooperatives like the "Red Flag Cooperative" in various provinces. For example, the Jianming Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, and the Shimen Songxiang Agricultural Cooperative in Yanggu County, Shandong Province, which Chairman Mao specially pointed out, are known to everyone, and there is no doubt that they will continue to grow or be discovered in various parts of the country in the future. The problem lies in making more exchanges of advanced experience, referring to each other, learning from each other, promoting work according to their own unique conditions, and vigorously developing production, completing the glorious task of a great agricultural harvest in 1957, and taking a big step forward in accordance with the struggle targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program. According to the current general situation, although there are indeed many cooperatives that are doing very well, the second-class cooperatives still account for the vast majority, and there are also many third-class cooperatives. Therefore, in promoting spring plowing work, gradually improving the work of the cooperatives cannot be ignored. The quality of agricultural production is closely and inseparably related to the quality of agricultural cooperatives, which has been proven by the experience of 1956. Because of this, we say that we suffered such a great natural disaster last year, and many of our major crops can still increase production, which fully proves the superiority of the cooperatives.

　　Last year was the first year after the universal victory of agricultural cooperativization. In terms of agricultural production, except for the disaster areas, probably 80% of the cooperatives increased production to varying degrees, and about 80% of the members in the production increase cooperatives increased their income. Judging from this number, after we changed the rural relations of production in the first year, the achievements of various places in leading the work of agricultural cooperatives are huge and should be affirmed. However, the cooperatives that reduced production and the members who reduced income, taking the national comprehensive statistics, although the proportion is not large, the absolute number is not small. There are certainly many reasons for this, the problems are also very complex, and we need everyone to work hard to make objective research, and we also need to do a lot of work very urgently. First of all, in terms of ideology, we must never doubt whether the cooperative system has superiority because some areas or some cooperatives have not done their work well, let alone regard the reduction of production and income as the evil consequences brought by the cooperatives. The facts of the "Red Flag Cooperative" increasing production and income fully prove the unparalleled superiority of agricultural cooperativization. The vivid examples ruthlessly refute these unfounded doubts. According to some materials we obtained from Hunan and Guangdong provinces: Hunan suffered a rare drought in decades last year. After agricultural cooperativization, under the unprecedented high labor enthusiasm of all the working farmers, the harm of the drought was greatly overcome and reduced, and 45%-50% of the cooperatives increased production. Among the production increase cooperatives, about half of the cooperatives may reach 90% of the members increasing their income; the other half of the cooperatives have about 70%-80% of the members increasing their income. In Guangdong, after the second half of June last year, various places also suffered droughts of varying degrees, but the total grain output of the province reached 24 billion jin, an increase of 9.8% compared with 1955, exceeding the highest level in any year in history, and also exceeding the rate of grain growth in any year after liberation. According to statistics from 11,903 cooperatives: 2,160 cooperatives with more than 90% of members increasing their income, accounting for 21.9%; 1,196 cooperatives with more than 85% of members increasing their income, accounting for 10%; 2,019 cooperatives with more than 80% of members increasing their income, accounting for 16.9%; 1,829 cooperatives with more than 75% of members increasing their income, accounting for 15.3%; 951 cooperatives with more than 70% of members increasing their income, accounting for 7.9%; 3,298 cooperatives with less than 70% of members increasing their income, accounting for 27.7%.

　　It can be seen from the above figures that the vast majority of cooperatives in Hunan and Guangdong provinces (except for the disaster areas) have increased production, and most of the members have increased their income. There is no doubt that agricultural cooperatives are supported by the majority of people. Affirming the achievements of agricultural cooperativization is the main and basic aspect, which is completely correct. At the same time, we must also see the other side: those households with the same income and those with reduced income are dissatisfied, some want to withdraw from the cooperative, and in some places, they even make trouble to withdraw from the cooperative or simply take the cattle away and live their original lives. For example, in Guangdong Province, in the winter of last year, 160,000 peasant households, accounting for about 2% of the peasant households joining the cooperative, made trouble to withdraw from the cooperative, of which 80,000 peasant households, accounting for about 1% of the peasant households joining the cooperative, withdrew from the cooperative. In addition, there are some people who are dissatisfied with the cooperative. After investigation and research, it is felt that there are two main reasons:

　　1. After the establishment of the cooperative, organizing the members to manage large-scale production and manage and distribute a large number of products, the work itself is very complex and heavy. In addition, this change in the relations of production is also the first year, and there are many problems related to the vital interests of the members that need to be dealt with urgently, but most of the cadres lack experience.

　　2. Agricultural cooperatives are collective economic organizations organized by working farmers on the basis of voluntary mutual benefit. The members come from all strata of the countryside, with complex components and complex ideas. Although the general aspects of everyone's demands are the same, many specific demands in terms of production and life are often different.

　　Therefore, the following specific situations occur:

　　1. The poor and lower-middle peasants, who account for 60%-70% of the agricultural population, are indeed the basic force of the cooperative. As they themselves said: they cherish the cooperative from the bottom of their hearts, and even iron bars cannot break it up. Although some of them have doubts, waver, and want to withdraw from the cooperative or have withdrawn from the cooperative due to temporary reduction in income or because some cooperatives are not doing well enough, control too much and too rigidly, and do not have pocket money to spend, which affects their lives, in general, they do not complain about the cooperative, but only complain that they have less labor force, are weak, have a large population, earn less, spend more, or are sick at some time, etc.

　　2. Another 20%-30% of the agricultural population are middle peasants, especially a small part of the wealthy middle peasants. Some of them dislike the fact that there is a lot of work and it is hard in the cooperative. They cannot be free and independent, and are not used to collective labor. They like to engage in some sideline production or some commercial activities on their own to earn more money. Some of them have relatively good land and means of production before cooperativization, and some even hire casual workers or rent out cattle, etc., with slight exploitation, and their income is relatively good. After joining the cooperative, there is some reduction, so they often say bad things and make trouble to withdraw from the cooperative or become the backbone of withdrawing from the cooperative. As for those wealthy middle peasants with a much stronger labor force, they are still very good laborers in the cooperative, and their income does not decrease, and many have even increased their income.

　　3. There are also some people who were inexplicably pushed in by the great wave of the time when they joined the cooperative. Their own occupation originally had little to do with agricultural production. For example, small traders or some handicraftsmen, so when they encounter some unsatisfactory things, they often say strange things and make trouble to withdraw from the cooperative.

　　4. Finally, there are some who do want to withdraw from the cooperative because there are serious shortcomings and errors in the work of the agricultural cooperative itself. Some have wrong management policies and production plans; some have poor management; some have poor labor organization, unreasonable work assignments and division of labor; some have unfair distribution, causing dissatisfaction; and some have suffered losses or are afraid of suffering losses due to the rude and bad style of the cadres, etc.

　　In short, there are many reasons for making trouble to withdraw from the cooperative or withdrawing from the cooperative, and there are many excuses. However, if the leadership of the cooperative is strengthened politically and organizationally, and appropriate solutions are made according to various specific situations, such as the handling of means of production entering the cooperative, private plots, scattered fruit trees, small tea hills, and small-area fish ponds, and the arrangement of labor force, etc., can be properly handled according to the principle of mutual benefit for middle and poor peasants and the correct combination of collective interests and individual interests, and then strengthen political and ideological education work, promote righteousness, criticize unhealthy trends and incorrect opinions, and enable cadres who have committed such problems to frankly and selflessly explain the shortcomings and admit the shortcomings and errors to the members, and resolve to correct them according to everyone's correct criticisms and opinions, and promote democracy to run the cooperative well, it is completely possible to change the situation of making trouble to withdraw from the cooperative in some areas. Since October 1956, Guangdong Province has done a lot of specific work in this regard, which has not only basically stopped the adverse wind of making trouble to withdraw from the cooperative, but also 60% of the peasant households that have withdrawn from the cooperative have returned to the cooperative.

　　Local experiences have proved that the three instructions issued by the Central Committee and the State Council in 1956 on "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily," "strengthening the production leadership and organizational construction of agricultural production cooperatives," and "autumn harvest distribution" are all very valuable and timely, and have played an extremely important role in consolidating the work of agricultural cooperatives in various places. In the future, the two policies of "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily" and "running the cooperative democratically" will of course need to be urged by all parties to enable this spirit to be implemented in every cooperative and gradually run the cooperative well. In actual action, respond to Chairman Mao's cordial call to run the cooperative well in three to five years. Excavate our unlimited potential and accelerate the steps of the victory of agricultural cooperativization and the victory of national industrialization. (Attached picture)

    农业合作社有巨大的增产力量
　　王观澜谈广东“红旗社”增产前后
    我完全拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话和周总理、李副总理的报告，同意陈叔通副主席关于政协常委会工作报告并衷心地拥护陈云副总理关于增产节约的发言。现在，我只就农村问题，说一些意见。
    去年我国是社会主义改造取得伟大胜利的第一年，也是农村生产关系起了根本变化的第一年，我曾两次下乡视察，想从实际变革中，从群众中得些基本教益。第一次到了江苏、浙江两省，是四、五月间，正是春耕插秧季节；第二次到了湖南、广东，是十一月、十二月间，正是秋收之后，各农业合作社忙于分配结算的时候。两次视察的时间，都不算太长，但印象却很深，教育意义也很大，同时感觉到自己知识太少，在实际事物迅速发展面前学习，是丰富多采、无穷无尽的。在我看了上十个不同类型的农业社后，尤其是看了“红旗社”后，深受感动，深深感觉到组织起来后，力量是很雄伟的。如果大家都能够抱着一定要把社办好的决心，充分发挥集体力量，发挥各个人的经验、智慧和技能，调动一切积极因素发展生产，是有无可比拟的优越性的。实际上人们想实现自己高尚的理想，战胜自然，改造自然，使自己过幸福愉快的日子，只有坚决拥护这个改造，实现社会主义制度中的重要一环——农业社会主义改造。现在我把“红旗社”发展情形，向大家谈谈。
      一、“红旗社”的过去和现在
    “红旗社”是广东省南海县海中乡劳动农民在共产党和人民政府领导之下组织起来的一个农业生产合作社。海中乡97％的农民都加入了“红旗社”。该乡过去原是一个穷村庄，全乡二百九十五户只有一头水牛，二千四百多亩水田，都要用老镢头翻或人力拉犁耕种，常遭水患，收成很不稳定。抗战时，经过日寇烧杀抢掠，一部分瓦屋变成了不蔽风雨的破茅房；抗战结束后，国民党又给这个地方加添了一些穷苦相。但是同时也带来了一个好处：人民在这艰苦的岁月里锻炼成了一股坚强不移的革命意志。解放后，经过了土改，到1954年在互助组的基础上创办了“红旗”、“红棉”两个初级农业生产合作社。在1955年秋后的社会主义革命高潮的第一个浪潮中，又将两个初级社合并并吸收了一百七十四户单干户；扩大成为现在具有二百八十六户，一千一百零八口人的高级合作社了。经过1956年一年考验，该社的成就，不但是南海县的一面光辉旗帜，广东省的一面光辉旗帜，也是中华人民共和国在农业社会主义改造事业中的一面鲜明的光辉灿烂的旗帜！它使土地提高了产量，达到亩产一千零二十五斤，提前超过了全国农业发展纲要草案中所指示的奋斗指标。猪、鸡、鸭、鹅等家禽家畜，大量繁殖成长，供给国家需要，满足社员要求，使社员们喜气洋洋地对自己生活、对社的发展前途、对国家光辉前景充满了胜利信心。在大家一年辛勤劳动之后，在平常年景下做到了丰产丰收，夺得了南海县第一个千斤亩的红旗，获得了全社全年农副业总产值三千六百七十七万八千九百九十六元（包括社员家庭副业在内），比1955年增加了56.13％。除了交纳公粮四十九万九千多斤，超额卖出一百零五万斤余粮给国家，留了来年扩大再生产费用，超额的归还了到期贷款，留了公积金、公益金，大量扩大了社的公共财产——耕牛三十二头、小艇一百四十五只、抽水机一部、猪、鹅、鸭舍及犁耙等农具值一万五千五百元及其他大量流动财产外，还普遍地增加了社员的收入，大大改善了社员的生活。吸引该乡九户曾决心单干下去的农民，也动摇起来，连前年带头退社一连四十天不出勤的上中农梁娣也坚定起来，并成为串连别人入社的积极分子了。
    二、全面地发展了生产，全社平均亩产超过千斤
    “红旗社”在正确的经营方针下，充分利用了一切有利条件，抓紧了以增产粮食为主、开展多种经营，使农副业有机的配合，互相支援，在合理地解决了公私经济关系、适当地安排分工派工、发挥了社员们的积极性、创造性，在各人的劳动热忱和责任心高涨的基础上，全面地发展了生产。1956年本来是一个平常年景，并不特别风调雨顺，其他自然条件，“红旗社”与周围区乡比较，亦不显得特殊。但是“红旗社”却做到了农作物全面丰产丰收，获得惊人成就。
    稻谷：全社二千二百多亩水田平均每亩产量达一千零二十五斤（冬小麦未包括在内）比八成年景的1955年亩产七百二十斤增产42.36％。增产的措施，除基本解决水利问题、大力积肥造肥、改用良种、改变耕作制度、进行小株、单株密植等收到良好效果外，特别是改造低产田和垫高积水田，使五百亩酸性较大的水田，从每亩五百——六百斤产量，提高到九百——一千斤，只此一项就增加了二十万斤稻谷。
    经济作物：茨菇、草菇、荸荠、瓜菜等亦提高了产量与产值，使全年达到六万五千多元占农业总收入二十六万七千九百八十元的24.46％。
    在饲养业方面的发展亦很可观，1955年只有母猪十九头，1956年增至四十九头，另增公猪二头，肉猪四百五十头，共五百零一头。1955年有母鸭三百八十五只，1956年增至八百余只。鸡、鹅亦大量增加。牛则由一头、三头增到了三十二头。此外，五十六亩鱼塘的鱼产，也供给了国家和社员需要。
    “红旗社”养殖家禽家畜，除供社需要外，还采取以繁殖为主、大量帮助社员猪苗、鸭苗，发展家庭副业。据已有的材料，截至去年9月止，二百八十六户社员，共养猪四百二十八头，另出卖了二百一十头，平均全乡每户养猪二点二头。养鸡八千七百五十只，平均每户三十只。养鸭六千八百只，平均每户二十四只。社员猪苗、鸭苗困难，社采取了积极扶持态度，有计划的帮助解决。
    这里特别谈一谈养猪问题：“红旗社”在养猪方面，是有宝贵经验的。1956年养猪五百多头，全部都不用粮食喂养，只用经过发酵不加烧煮的水浮莲（冬季没有水浮莲时，可用母猪菜或其他蔬菜做发酵饲料）、茜草等青饲料来喂养。猪既爱吃、长得又快，饲料不加烧煮，既省工夫、又省柴火。具体计算是：每只猪每天只要六斤发酵青饲料加一斤谷糠（母猪吃细糠，小猪可加些碎米）、一斤酒糟水，平均每只猪养到一百六十斤，只用谷糠三百二十斤，糟水四百八十斤，成本很低，获利很大。根据去年价格计算，每头猪可获纯利四十多元。
    三、社员普遍增加收入，生活大大改善了
    在全面发展生产的基础上，社员普遍地增加了收入。每个社员从社里分得的每个劳动日值为一点四一元，平均每户社员连家庭副业全年可收入八百零一元，已经超过当地建社前每户中农平均全年收入六百五十元的水平。富裕中农也超过了他们过去的平均水平。过去全乡收入最多的九户上中农，在1953年平均每户纯收入是八百九十四元，1956年增加到平均每户一千一百六十八元，增加30％。又以全乡过去收入最多的老上中农梁国、梁容二户为例。梁国六口人，二个劳动力，过去十亩多田，平均每亩产量八百五十斤，收入七百一十四元；菜地八分，收入二百四十元；旱地五分，收入一百元；一年养猪八头，收入四百八十元，卖小猪收入五十元；家禽收入一百五十元。以上共收入一千七百三十四元，除成本及交公粮等后，纯收入一千零八元。1956年他全家作了六百三十七个劳动日，得劳动报酬八百九十八元；自留地收入一百元；一年养猪七头，收入五百三十元；家禽收入二百七十元。除成本及交公粮等后，纯收入一千三百三十元，比1953年增加三百二十二元。另一户上中农梁容，1953年总收入一千二百元左右（未除成本）。入社后因有六个劳动力出勤，作了一千三百个劳动日，得劳动报酬一千八百三十三元，加上家庭副业，全年收入二千六百八十五元，比1953年收入增加100％。这些材料就可以充分说明上中农所以对合作化停止动摇不闹退社的基本原因了。
    由于收入增加，社员们的生活大大改善了。1955年用不完的油票、糖票、布票的贫农和下中农，已经感到不够用了。许多过去吸烟草的，现在吸纸烟了，过去吸一角四分一包的××牌纸烟，现在要吸一角九分一包的××牌的纸烟了；被服、用具也在大量的补充，有些甚至大人、小孩每人都要做两套新衣，买顶新帽；有些还改变了过去的习惯，穿着鞋子下地了。新中农梁森一家九口人，一年糖票六十多斤买光了，还说不够呢！社员对文化的要求也迫切了。该乡几个民校，夜间都在上课。而那所三百多学生的小学，正准备进一步健全和充实。总之，“红旗社”在高级化后，实行勤俭办社的第一年，就在生产上、生活上、人们的精神上，大大改变了原来的面貌。
    这样，结论就可以这样做，他们经过去年的集体劳动，生产、生活水平都超过了过去中农的平均水平。因此，他们热忱更高，信心更大，在全体社员大会上，大家一致地通过了1957年的生产计划。增产指标如下：
    集体方面：
    稻谷：平均每亩产量为一千一百斤，比去年增产七十五斤；
    经济作物总产值比去年增加121％；
    饲养业：猪发展到一千二百头，比去年增加六百九十九头，鸭、鸡发展到一万九千二百五十只，比去年增加八千三百二十只，饲养业总产值比去年增加284％；
    集体副业比去年增加65.5％。
    社员家庭副业方面：
    养猪一千四百四十头，平均每户全年养猪五头；
    养鸡：平均每户五十只，比去年增加33％；
    养鸭：平均每户三十只，比去年增加25％；
    养鹅：平均每户十只，比去年增加43％。
    根据这个增产指标，1957年每个劳动日价值可达二元。连家庭副业，平均每户社员纯收入可达一千一百七十八元，比1956年增长56.65％。这个水平，已经是过去的中农所不可比拟的了。
    在这里，我满怀信心地相信“红旗社”在共产党的领导下，经过全体社员努力，一定能够在今年农副业生产上获得比去年更大的成绩。
    四、交流先进经验，改进工作，实现1957年农业大丰收
      “红旗社”是南海县的一个好社，也是广东省的一个好社。据说像“红旗社”办得这样好的社，在广东省各地第一批发现的已有二百个左右。这是广东省广大群众的光荣。但是广东省普遍办社的历史不是最久的，它像全国许多地方一样，只有一年多。当然像“红旗社”这样的好社，各省都有。如像毛主席特别指出过为大家所知道的河北省遵化县有建明农林牧生产合作社，山东省阳谷县有石门宋乡农业合作社等等，并且以后将在全国各地继续不断的增长或被发现，这是没有疑问的。问题在于要作更多的交流先进经验，互相参考，互相学习，按照自己特有条件，推进工作，来大力发展生产，完成1957年的农业大丰收的光荣任务，按照全国农业发展纲要所规定的奋斗目标，大踏步地前进一步。按目前一般情况看，办得很好的社，固然不少，但二类社还是占绝大多数，三类社也不少。因此，在推进春耕工作中，逐步改进社的工作，亦不可忽视。农业生产好坏，与农业合作社办得好坏，有着密切不可分离的关系，这为1956年的经验所证明了的。正因为这样，所以我们说去年遭到这样大的自然灾害，我们许多主要农作物还能增产，充分证明了合作社的优越性。
    去年是农业合作化普遍获得胜利后的第一个年头。农业生产方面，除掉灾区以外，大概有80％的社程度不同的增了产，在增产社中有80％左右的社员增加了收入。从这个数字来看，我们在第一年改变了农村生产关系以后，各地在领导农业合作社工作上的成绩巨大，是应该肯定的。但是，减产的社，减收的社员，拿全国综合来说，占的比例虽不大，但绝对数却不小。这里固然原因极多，问题也很复杂，需要我们大家努力作客观的研究，也需要很迫切的作很多的工作。首先在思想方面，我们绝对不能因为某些地区某些合作社工作没有作好，就怀疑合作社制度是否有优越性，更不能把减产减收，当成是合作社带来的恶果。“红旗社”增产增收的实事，充分地证明了农业合作化的无比优越性。活的事例，无情地驳斥了这些怀疑毫无根据。据我们所得到的湖南、广东两省的一部分材料：湖南去年遭受了几十年罕有的大旱灾，在农业合作化之后，在全体劳动农民空前高涨的劳动热情之下，大大克服和减轻了灾荒的危害，作到了45％—50％的社增加了生产。在增产社中，大约有一半社可能达到90％的社员增加收入；另一半社大约有70％—80％的社员增加收入。在广东去年6月下半月后，各地也受到了不同程度的旱灾，但是该省粮食总产量达到了二百四十亿斤，比1955年增产9.8％，超过了历史上任何一年最高的水平，也超过了解放后任何一年粮食增长的速度。据一万一千九百零三个社的统计：90％以上的社员增收的社，有二千一百六十个，占21.9％；85％以上社员增收的社，有一千一百九十六个，占10％；80％以上社员增收的社，有二千零十九个社，占16.9％；75％以上社员增收的社，有一千八百二十九个，占15.3％；70％以上社员增收的社，有九百五十一个，占7.9％；70％以下社员增收的社，有三千二百九十八个，占27.7％。
    从上面这些数目字中可以看出，湖南、广东两省（除了灾区）最大多数的社，是增了产，大多数社员增加了收入。没有疑问，农业合作社是为大多数人所拥护的。肯定农业合作化成绩是主要的、基本的一面，完全是正确的。同时，也必须看到另一面，那些平收户和减收户心怀不满，有些想退社，在某些地方甚至闹退社或者直截了当的把牛牵走，过他原来的生活。例如：广东省在去年冬季有十六万农户约占入社农户的2％闹退社，其中有八万农户约占入社农户的1％退了社，此外，还有一些人对社不满。经过调查研究之后，感觉到主要原因有两个：
    一、建社后，组织社员经营大生产，管理和分配大量产品，工作本身就很复杂、繁重，加以这种生产关系的改变，又是第一年，急待处理的关系社员切身利益的问题又多，而多数干部却缺乏经验。
    二、农业社是劳动农民在自愿互利的基础上组织起来的集体经济组织，社员来自农村各阶层，成份复杂，思想复杂，各人要求大的总的方面虽然相同，但在生产、生活方面的许多具体要求，却常不相同。
    因此，发生以下的一些具体情况：
    1、占农业人口60％—70％的贫农和下中农，他们中间绝大多数确实是社的基本力量，正像他们自己所说的那样：从心底里爱护社，铁棒也打不散。虽然其中也有些人因一时减少收入或者因某些社还办得不好，控制得过多过死，没有零钱花而影响生活，发生疑虑，动摇想退社或退社，但是他们总的方面并不怨社，只是抱怨自己劳动力少、弱、人口多、赚的少、支出大或在什么时候病了等等。
    2、另占农业人口20％—30％的中农，特别是富裕中农中的一少部分，其中有些人，则嫌社里活多、苦重，不能自由自主，过不惯集体劳动的生活，喜欢自己单独搞些副业生产或作些商业活动，多赚些钱。有些人则因在合作化前有比较良好的土地和生产资料，甚至有些还雇零工或出租牛犋等轻微剥削，收入比较优裕，入社后有某些减少，因此常说坏话闹退社或当退社的骨干分子。至于那些劳动力强的多的富裕中农，还是社里的很好的劳动者，他们的收入并不减少，有许多还增加了收入。
    3、还有些人本来在入社时，就是莫名其妙的，是被当时的高潮大浪推进去的，他本身的职业本来跟农业生产就没有多大关系。例如小商小贩或某些手工业者，所以，他们遇到某些不如意的事，也常会说怪话，闹退社。
    4、最后还有一部分确实是因为农业社本身工作中存在着严重的缺点、错误。有些是经营方针、生产计划不对头；有些是经营管理不善；有些是劳动组织不好，派工、分工不当；有些是分配不公，引起不满；还有些则因干部作风粗暴恶劣吃了亏或害怕吃亏等等原因要求退社。
    总之，闹退社或退社的原因很多，借口也很多。但是如果在政治上、组织上对合作社加强领导，针对各种具体情况加以适当解决，例如生产资料入社、自留地、零星果树、小块茶山和小面积鱼塘的处理、劳动力的安排等等，都能根据中、贫农互利政策和集体利益与个人利益正确结合的原则，妥善处理，再加强政治思想教育工作，发扬正气、批评歪风和不正确的意见，使犯有这类毛病的干部，能向社员坦白无私地说明缺点，承认缺点错误，决心根据大家正确的批评和意见来加以改正，发扬民主，把社办好，是完全可以改变某些地区闹退社的状况的。广东省从56年10月份起，在这一方面作了许多具体工作，不但基本上停止了闹退社的逆风，而且已有60％已退社的农户，又重新回到社里来了。
    各地经验证明，中央和国务院在1956年发的关于“勤俭办社”“加强农业生产合作社的生产领导和组织建设”和“秋收分配”等三个指示都很宝贵，很及时，对巩固各地农业社的工作，起了极重要的作用。今后对“勤俭办社”和“民主办社”这两条方针当然还更需要各方面加以督促，使这一精神，能够贯彻到各个社里去，把社逐步办好。在实际行动中，响应毛主席的要在三、五年内把社办好的亲切号召。把我们蕴藏着无限潜力发掘出来，加速农业合作化胜利的步骤，加速国家工业化胜利的步骤。（附图片）
