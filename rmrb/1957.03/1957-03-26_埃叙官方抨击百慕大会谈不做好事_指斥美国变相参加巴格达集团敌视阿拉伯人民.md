Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 25th: Egyptian public opinion strongly criticizes the results of the US-British Bermuda talks and the US announcement to participate in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee.
　　
Egyptian officials commented on the Bermuda talks to a Middle East News Agency reporter on March 24th, saying that "the conference completely ignored the rights of the Arabs."
　　
These officials said that the final communiqué of the meeting between the US President and the British Prime Minister "is merely a continuation of policies of bias and policies aimed at undermining Arab unity."
　　
Cairo Radio said last night that "the Bermuda talks held at this time have no other purpose than to put pressure on Egypt."
　　
The radio said, "The travels of Eisenhower's representative, special envoy Richards, and Vice President Nixon, are another means of putting pressure on Egypt."
　　
Cairo newspapers on March 24th commented on the US joining the Baghdad Pact Military Committee. Al-Ahram said: "Even if the United States participates in every committee already established or to be established by this treaty, whether or not it participates in the treaty itself, as long as the Arab countries continue to oppose it, this treaty will still not show any signs of vitality."
　　
According to a Middle East News Agency report from Amman last night, the governments of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan are arranging talks to adopt a common stance regarding the US participation in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee. The report also said that these three countries may refuse to receive US presidential envoy Richards as a response to the aforementioned US action.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, March 25th, Damascus Dispatch: Syrian Radio and officials criticized the US joining the Baghdad Pact Military Committee on March 24th.
　　
Officials said that the US announcement of its willingness to join the Baghdad Pact Military Committee is equivalent to "closing any possible door for the United States and the liberated Arab countries to reach an understanding." This action by the United States is equivalent to "actual and full participation in this treaty."
　　
Damascus Radio said that the US participation in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee clearly proves the stubbornness of US policy and also proves the US refusal to understand the national aspirations of the people of the Middle East. But the United States still uses the excuse of preventing the danger of communism. The radio said that the US announcement of joining the Baghdad Pact Military Committee has combined itself with the imperialist bloc that has already been rejected by the people of the Middle East.

　　埃叙官方抨击百慕大会谈不做好事
　　指斥美国变相参加巴格达集团敌视阿拉伯人民
    据新华社开罗25日电　埃及舆论强烈抨击美英百慕大会谈的结果和美国宣布参加巴格达条约军事委员会。
    埃及官方人士3月24日对中东通讯社记者评论百慕大会谈说，“会议全然忽视了阿拉伯人的权利”。
    这些人士说，美国总统和英国首相的会谈的最后公报“只是偏袒政策和从事破坏阿拉伯团结的政策的延续”。
    开罗电台昨天晚上说，“百慕大会谈在这个时候召开没有其它的目的，而只是要对埃及施加压力而已”。
    电台说，“艾森豪威尔的代表、特使理查兹和副总统尼克松的旅行，是对埃及施加压力的另一种手段”。
    3月24日的开罗报纸就美国加入巴格达条约军事委员会一事发表评论。金字塔报说：“即使美国参加这个条约所已经建立或者以后将要建立的每一个委员会，不管它是不是参加条约本身，只要阿拉伯国家继续反对它，这个条约仍旧不会表现出有生气的迹象。”
    据中东通讯社昨天晚间自安曼报道，埃及、叙利亚同约旦政府正在安排进行会谈，以便针对美国参加巴格达条约军事委员会一事采取共同的立场。报道还说，这三个国家可能会拒绝接待美国总统特使理查兹，作为他们对美国上述行动的回答。
    据新华社25日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚电台和官方人士3月24日抨击美国加入巴格达条约军事委员会。
    官方人士说，美国宣布它愿意加入巴格达条约军事委员会就等于“关上了美国和解放了的阿拉伯国家取得谅解的任何可能的大门。”美国的这一行动等于是“实际上充分地参加了这个条约”。
    大马士革电台说，美国参加巴格达条约军事委员会明显地证明了美国政策的顽固，也证明了美国拒绝了解中东人民的民族愿望。但是美国还托辞说是为了防止共产主义的危险。电台说，美国宣布加入巴格达条约军事委员会使它自己和已经被中东人民所拒绝的帝国主义集团结合在一起了。
