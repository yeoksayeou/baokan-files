Hebei Provincial Department of Health, Trade Union, Communist Youth League, and Women's Federation recently discussed how to carry out family planning work, and decided to continue to conduct extensive propaganda work on family planning to urban and rural men and women, cadres, workers, school teachers and staff, and the masses in the province.

In the second half of 1955, Hebei Province began general propaganda on family planning among cadres. In the second half of 1956, this propaganda was further extended to factories, mines, streets and the vast rural areas in cities through various means such as medical institutions, factory and mine clubs, youth and women's publications, and organizing lectures, speeches, and exhibitions. At the same time, the health department also began to pay attention to discovering and collecting folk family planning prescriptions from various aspects for research and experimentation, and carried out specific technical guidance on contraception; the pharmaceutical supply and marketing department strengthened the supply of contraceptive drugs and appliances. After this series of work, it has been proved that birth control is an urgent requirement of some people who have many children, have difficulty in life, or are in poor health. According to a survey by the Provincial Department of Health, 47 out of 48 women of childbearing age in Beiquantou Village, Gaoyang County, requested contraception. They urgently demanded to understand contraceptive knowledge and specific methods, and requested the supply of contraceptives. A male farmer in Luanping County said: "I have six children, and the life of a family of eight depends on me alone, but there is no way. The method the government said is really saving my life." A woman in Tangshan City ran to the health station every month to report good news after the contraceptive method took effect.

However, due to the insufficient understanding of the importance of family planning by some departments, they have not been able to carry out this work in a planned and step-by-step manner, so the propaganda of family planning is not widespread and in-depth enough, and many people still have various doubts and practical difficulties. At the same time, the several family planning methods that have been promoted are not simple and economical enough, and the supply of contraceptive drugs is not timely and sufficient, which also affects the further development of family planning work.

The meeting believes that health, cultural and educational departments and mass organizations at all levels should correct their understanding of family planning work, include this work as one of the daily tasks, and, under the leadership and supervision of party committees at all levels, conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda and education to cadres and the masses. According to past experience, in order to achieve good results in this work, we must first open up the thinking of grassroots cadres and give full play to the role of grassroots cadres and activists. Therefore, the current focus of propaganda should be on the level of grassroots cadres and activists, and through them, we should gradually conduct extensive propaganda to the masses. During the propaganda, it should be repeatedly explained that appropriately controlling births can not only improve people's health and improve people's lives, but also benefit the upbringing of the next generation, and is one of the specific manifestations of the government's concern for the lives of the masses. The content of propaganda should be determined according to the situation and occasion, emphasizing the significance and benefits of contraception. Whether to use contraception should be voluntary by the people, and no one should force or interfere. In terms of propaganda methods, we should give full play to the role of all relevant departments and adopt various forms. For example, carry out extensive propaganda through meetings, lectures, clubs, exhibitions, movies, slides, and using mass production meetings, and also publish popular contraceptive reading materials, broadcast contraceptive knowledge, train contraceptive propaganda and technical personnel, set up contraceptive guidance clinics, and promote health stations and delivery stations to combine delivery and prenatal examinations for propaganda.

The meeting also studied the supply of family planning drugs and appliances, and decided to increase supply points, and organize street and rural delivery stations, health stations, joint clinics, and employee family committees to sell contraceptive drugs on behalf of pharmaceutical companies to make it convenient for the masses to purchase. In terms of the organization and leadership of this work, health departments, science popularization associations, trade unions, the Communist Youth League, women's federations, and commercial and supply and marketing departments should cooperate closely. Mass organizations are mainly responsible for propaganda and organization mobilization, health departments combine propaganda with specific technical guidance on contraception, and commercial and supply and marketing departments should strengthen the organization, supply and marketing of contraceptives.

    河北省卫生厅等单位讨论节育工作
    决定向干部群众继续进行宣传
    本报讯  河北省卫生厅、工会、青年团和妇联，最近就如何开展节育工作进行了讨论，决定继续向全省城乡男女居民、机关干部、工人、学校教职员以及群众进行广泛的宣传工作。
    1955年下半年，河北省就在机关干部中开始了节育的一般宣传。1956年下半年，更进一步通过医疗机构、厂矿俱乐部、青年、妇女刊物以及组织讲座、演讲和展览等多种方式，把这一宣传扩展到城市的厂矿、街道和广大农村中。同时，卫生部门还开始注意从多方面发现和搜集民间节育药方进行研究试验，并进行了避孕的具体技术指导；医药供销部门加强了避孕药品和用具的供应工作。经过这一系列的工作，证明节制生育是一些孩子多、生活困难或身体不好的群众的迫切要求。根据省卫生厅的调查，在高阳县北圈头村四十八名生育年龄的妇女中，有四十七名要求避孕。他（她）们迫切要求懂得避孕常识和具体方法，要求供应避孕用具。滦平县一个男农民说：“我有六个孩子，一家八口人的生活全靠我一个人，可是也没有办法，政府说的这个办法真等于救了我的命。”唐山市一妇女自使用避孕方法生效后，每月都跑到保健站报喜。
    但是，由于一些部门对节育的重要意义认识不足，没有能够有计划有步骤地开展这一工作，因而节育的宣传还不够广泛深入，许多人还有着各种各样的疑虑和实际困难。同时目前已推行的几种节育方法还不够简便和经济，避孕药物的供应不及时不充分，也影响了节育工作的进一步开展。
    会议认为，各级卫生文教部门和群众团体应当端正对节育工作的认识，将这一工作列为日常工作之一，在各级党委的领导和督促下，广泛深入地向干部和群众进行宣传教育。根据过去的经验，为要使这一工作收到良好的效果，首先应打通基层干部的思想，充分发挥基层干部和积极分子的作用。因此，目前的宣传重点应放在基层干部和积极分子一层，通过他们再逐步向群众作广泛的宣传。在宣传时，要反复地说明适当地节制生育，不仅可以增进人民身体的健康，改善人民的生活，而且有益于下一代的教养，是政府关心群众生活的具体表现之一。宣传内容应按情况和场合决定，强调说明避孕的意义和好处。避孕与否应由人民自愿，任何人不得强制和干涉。在宣传的方法上，则应充分发挥各有关部门的作用，采取多种多样的形式。如通过会议、讲座、俱乐部、展览、电影、幻灯以及利用群众生产集会场合进行广泛的宣传，也可以出版通俗的避孕读物，播讲避孕常识，训练避孕的宣传和技术人员，设立避孕指导门诊部，并且推动保健站、接生站结合接生及产前检查等进行宣传。
    会议还研究了节育药品和用具的供应工作，决定增设供应点，组织街道、农村的接生站、保健站、联合诊所以及职工家属委员会等为医药公司代销避孕药品，使群众购买方便。在这一工作的组织领导方面，卫生部门、科学普及协会、工会、青年团、妇联和商业、供销等有关部门都应密切合作，群众团体主要负责宣传和组织发动工作，卫生部门结合宣传进行避孕的具体技术指导，商业和供销部门则应加强避孕用具的组织和供销工作。
