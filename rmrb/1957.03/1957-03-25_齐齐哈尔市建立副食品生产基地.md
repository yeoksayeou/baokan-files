Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, March 24th: Qiqihar City, Heilongjiang Province, is starting to establish a non-staple food production base in the suburbs.

According to arrangements made by the Qiqihar Municipal People's Committee, nine new vegetable production cooperatives have been established in the suburbs this year. Large vegetable greenhouses utilizing industrial waste steam are also expanding the variety of vegetables. The two hatcheries in the city plan to hatch 500,000 chicks this year. Once this plan is realized, there will be a sufficient supply of chickens and eggs. Farms and agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs have also determined to increase hog production by 60,000 heads this year and pay attention to breeding piglets. It is estimated that by the second half of 1958, the number of hogs fattened in the city will be sufficient to meet the consumption needs of all residents.

　  齐齐哈尔市建立副食品生产基地
    据新华社哈尔滨24日讯　黑龙江省齐齐哈尔市着手在市郊建立一个副食品生产基地。
    按照齐齐哈尔市人民委员会的安排，郊区今年新建立了九个蔬菜生产合作社。利用工业废蒸汽而建立的大型蔬菜温室，也扩大蔬菜品种。市内两处孵化站今年计划孵化鸡雏五十万只，这个计划实现以后，鸡和鸡蛋也就可以有充足的货源。市郊的农场和农业生产合作社还确定在年内增产生猪六万头，并注意繁殖仔猪。到1958年下半年，预计全市育肥的生猪就能够满足全市居民的食用需要。
