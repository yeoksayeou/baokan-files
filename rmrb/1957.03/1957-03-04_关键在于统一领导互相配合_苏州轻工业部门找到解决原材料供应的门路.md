The Key Lies in Unified Leadership and Mutual Cooperation
—Suzhou Light Industry Departments Find a Way to Solve Raw Material Supply Problems

By our reporters Zhen Weimin and Shi Yue'e

In the famous city of Suzhou, there are hundreds of light industrial products. Among them are the tea snacks and candies famous throughout the country, rose extracts praised as "the light of the motherland" by overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, various fragrances sold overseas, and various high-end traditional Chinese musical instruments, and so on. These products require nearly ten thousand kinds of raw materials. Most of them are not materials supplied uniformly by the state. However, with production increasing manyfold, they have basically ensured the supply of raw materials. At present, the raw materials for the first quarter have all been resolved. The raw material supply problems for the second quarter and even the whole year have also been found solutions and methods.

What is their "trick"? It mainly relies on unified leadership, giving play to the collective wisdom of supply and marketing personnel, and solving problems as self-reliantly as possible.

The timber supply situation is a good example.

Last year, the supply of wood products in the Suzhou market was quite tight. At the end of the year, the Suzhou Light Industry Bureau organized supply and marketing cadres from various factories to jointly study and resolve the city's timber supply problem. Did the city need 3,200 cubic meters of timber in the first quarter? Could some scarce timber varieties be replaced by others? At that time, the supply and marketing cadres of each factory lined up one by one, carefully calculated the accounts, helped each other, and verified the quotas. In the end, it was found that only more than 2,300 cubic meters of timber needed to be purchased. Many insiders also exchanged experiences and suggested some timber that could be substituted. For example, the Hezhong Abacus Factory originally specified the purchase of four kinds of timber, including *nai*, *ju*, *shinan*, and *lian* trees. After research, it was found that loquat, pear, jujube, elm, and *jinjuzi* trees could be used instead. They also researched the origin of various types of timber, so that everyone was familiar with the procurement routes.

According to the past method, the people sent by each factory would purchase the timber needed by their own factory; sometimes they would not go the right way and could not buy the goods; sometimes they would flock to one place to snap up and bid up prices. This time was different. The Light Industry Bureau convened a meeting of factory directors of state-owned factories, and decided that under the leadership of the bureau's supply and marketing section, supply and marketing cadres from various factories would be organized to go out for unified procurement; during the period of departure, the procurement personnel of each factory would obey the unified leadership of the bureau and report to the bureau every day. The bureau also specially printed a "Detailed Timber Procurement Table" and distributed it to the supply and marketing personnel of each factory. Before setting off for procurement, the person in charge of the Light Industry Bureau also put forward "three rules" to them: first, to go through the local Party and government leading organs; second, to abide by local listed prices and not to raise prices; third, to take the "main road" and not the "small road," and not to snap up or purchase goods for speculation. With such organized procurement, there are generally many gains. Some people have also discovered new sources of materials. For example, a procurement team that went to Binghui County, Anhui Province, found that local farmers were burning a kind of high-grade timber used for making abacuses—sugar pear trees—as firewood. There are many of these trees locally. After studying with the local Party and government leading organs and timber company, a contract was signed, and the local agricultural cooperative would supply this timber for a long time. In this way, by the beginning of January, the timber needed by the abacus factory for the first quarter was completely resolved.

The source of timber raw materials was found, but it would not work if the loopholes in factory waste were not plugged. The Light Industry Bureau led a working group to conduct in-depth inspections of key factories and found many wasteful phenomena and many ways to save. For example, the abacuses produced by the Hezhong Abacus Factory had many specifications and varieties, and the phenomenon of using large materials for small purposes and using good materials for inferior purposes was quite serious; it seemed that an abacus bead was very small, but the factory scrapped 167 *dan* of abacus beads in a month. The blanks for abacus frames were also cut too long. If the consumption quota was shortened by half an inch, 400 *dan* of timber could be saved every month, equivalent to more than 2,000 yuan. After such investigation and research, everyone understood why the factory had lost more than 20,000 yuan last year! In January this year, the abacus factory improved the method of turning timber, and the utilization rate of timber for producing abacus beads increased from the original 30% to 55%. In January, they not only did not lose money, but made a profit of more than 12,000 yuan.

Seeing that this method of solving raw material problems by using collective strength was effective, the Light Industry Bureau established a weekly office meeting system for supply and marketing cadres of various factories. Sometimes they discussed supply and marketing business by industry, sometimes by product, familiarized themselves with procurement routes, exchanged experiences, and uniformly organized material supply. In this way, not only can manpower and material resources be saved and artificial tensions be reduced, but also the difficulty of insufficient raw material supply can be overcome within the scope of a bureau.

Organized unified procurement does not mean contracting to supply all kinds of raw materials. Therefore, they still maintain and develop the cooperative relations between various factories and raw material supply units in other places. For example, Suzhou Chemical Industry and Shanghai Chemical Industry have always had very close ties. Shanghai needs a large number of fragrances produced in Suzhou to manufacture cosmetics such as soaps and perfumes, and some of the raw materials for manufacturing fragrances in some chemical factories in Suzhou are products of chemical factories in Shanghai. After these factories became joint state-private enterprises, they still maintained this relationship. However, in the past, these connections were mainly based on factories, and the mutual support of raw materials had always been kept secret among peers. Therefore, various chemical factories in Suzhou had to send their own procurement personnel to be stationed in Shanghai for a long time. Before the fourth quarter of last year, there were often forty or fifty people from various factories stationed in Shanghai. This was not only uneconomical, but also led to phenomena such as some factories stockpiling certain raw materials and some factories not being able to supply them. Therefore, the Light Industry Bureau organized various factories to uniformly send eight people to work together in Shanghai. Each factory can also temporarily send people to Shanghai to purchase raw materials, but they often accept the entrustment of the Light Industry Bureau and handle some business for other factories. After these people arrive in Shanghai, they generally contact the joint office to avoid duplication of procurement. In this way, the raw materials of chemical factories throughout the city have been relatively properly resolved.

At present, they are also actively trying to produce new products and substitutes in order to further improve the raw material supply situation. The raw material—carbolic acid—that Sanwu Chemical Factory needs to manufacture fragrances is currently in serious shortage in China. They have decided to produce carbolic acid themselves. Now, Shi Muru, an engineer from Sanwu Chemical Factory, has successfully trial-produced carbolic acid in the laboratory using stagnant products. The Light Industry Bureau has allocated an investment of 5,000 yuan for basic construction, and it will soon be put into production. It is estimated that by the end of the year, the factory can produce 45 tons of carbolic acid, which can not only meet the factory's own production needs, but also increase the country's wealth by 130,000 yuan. When the woodworking factory heard that Shanghai was using wood chips to produce chess pieces and toys, they were also trying to make toys from wood chips in order to save timber for the country. The chemical factory is also preparing to produce more than 20 new varieties to overcome raw material difficulties and meet market needs.

Speaking of the raw material supply problem, people will also think of some squabbles between industry and commerce. In the second quarter of last year, the Suzhou Chemical Industry Company was just established, and it was asked to undertake the raw material supply work of dozens of chemical factories. At that time, the Chemical Industry Company could not complete the order plan, and the industrial department wanted it to compensate for the losses, causing disharmony and mistrust between them, reaching the city and the province. The order plans of the industrial departments were often set too high, and the commercial departments would approve "no supply," "supply upon arrival," or "organized supply," and were unwilling to actively find ways to ensure the needs of the factories. This kind of impulsive behavior was of no benefit to production. The Suzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Suzhou Municipal People's Committee specially convened a symposium of responsible cadres from both sides, explained the pros and cons, and communicated relations. The industrial department guaranteed to verify the needs, and the commercial department guaranteed to disclose the inventory, jointly responsible for production. Later, the industrial and commercial departments jointly convened supply and marketing cadres of various factories to study the raw material supply situation of major products, and proposed which raw materials the commercial company could guarantee supply, which raw materials needed the commercial department to overcome difficulties to solve, which were to be solved by the industrial department itself, and which could not be solved and needed the factory to change the product design. In this way, everyone was more confident. Now, a new atmosphere of mutual understanding and mutual assistance has emerged between the industrial and commercial departments in Suzhou. This has also played a not-so-small role in solving the raw material supply problem more smoothly.

    关键在于统一领导互相配合
    ——苏州轻工业部门找到解决原材料供应的门路
    本报记者  甄为民  史越峨
    在著名的苏州市，轻工业产品有好几百种。其中有驰名全国的茶食、糖果，有被南洋华侨誉为“祖国之光”的玫瑰花浸膏，有行销海外的各种香精，还有各种高级国乐器，等等。这些产品需要近万种原料。大部分又不是国家统一供应的物资，在生产成倍增长的情况下，他们却基本上保证了原材料的供应。目前，第一季度的原料已经全部解决了。第二季度以至全年的原料供应问题，也找到了解决的门路和方法。
    他们的“窍门”是什么呢？主要是靠统一领导，发挥供销人员的集体智慧，尽可能自力更生地解决问题。
    木材供应情况就是很好的例子。
    去年一年，苏州市市场上木材制成品供应相当紧张；年底，苏州市轻工业局组织各厂的供销干部，共同研究解决全市的木材供应问题。全市第一季度是否需要三千二百立方公尺木材？有些奇缺的木材品种是否可以用另一些品种代替？当时，各厂的供销干部就一笔一笔地排队，算细账，并且互相帮助，核实定额。最后发现只要采购二千三百多立方公尺的木材就足够了。许多内行人还在一起交流了经验，提出了一些可以代用的木材。如合众算盘厂原来指定要采购栬木、椐木、石楠、槤树等四种木材，经过研究，发现可以用枇杷树、梨木、枣树、榆树、金钩子树等代替。他们还对各种木材的产地作了研究，使大家熟悉了采购的路线。
    按照过去的办法，各厂派出的人采购到本厂所需要的木材就行了；有时候跑得不对路，买不到货；有时候又一窝蜂地拥到一个地方去抢购竞购。这次不同了。轻工业局召开了公方厂长会议，决定在局供销科领导下，组织各厂的供销干部统一外出采购；在出发工作期间，各厂的采购人员服从局里统一领导，每天向局里汇报。局里还专门印制了一份“采购木材明细表”，发给各厂供销人员。在出发采购以前，轻工业局的负责人又向他们提出“约法三章”：一要通过当地党政领导机关；二要服从当地牌价，不得抬高物价；三要走“大路”不走“小路”，不要抢购套购。这样有组织地下去采购，一般都有不少收获。有些人还发现了新的材料来源。如到安徽省炳辉县去的一个采购组，就发现当地农民将一种做算盘用的高级木材——糖梨树当柴烧。这种树当地有很多，经过同当地党政领导机关和木材公司研究，签订了合同，由当地农业合作社长期供应这种木材。这样一来，到1月上旬，算盘厂第一季度需要的木材就全部得到了解决。
    木材的原料来源找到了，但是不堵塞工厂浪费用材的漏洞还是不行的。轻工业局领导了工作组，深入重点工厂检查发现了许多浪费现象，找到了许多节约办法。如合众算盘厂生产的算盘规格、品种比较多，大材小用、优材劣用的现象相当严重；看起来一颗算盘珠很小，可是这个厂一个月报废的算盘珠竟有一百六十七担，算盘框子的毛坯也开得太长，如果消耗定额缩短半寸，每月就能节约四百担木材，折合二千多元。这样一调查研究，大家明白了，难怪这个厂去年要亏本二万多元呢！今年1月份，这个算盘厂改进了车木材的方法，生产算盘珠的木材利用率从原来的30％提高到55％。1月份他们不但没有亏本，反而获利一万二千多元。
    轻工业局看到这种运用集体力量解决原料问题的办法行之有效，就建立了各厂供销干部每周一次的办公会议制度。他们有时候按照行业，有时候以产品为单位，讨论供销业务，熟悉采购路线，交流经验，统一组织物资供应。这样，不仅可以节省人力、物力，减少人为的紧张，而且在一个局的范围内克服了原料供应不足的困难。
    有组织地统一采购，并不等于把各种原料包下来供应。因此，他们仍旧保持和发展了各厂同外地原料供应单位的协作关系。例如，苏州化学工业和上海化学工业历来有很密切的联系。上海要制造香皂、香水等化妆品，需要苏州生产的大量香精，而苏州一些化工厂制造香精的部分原料，又是上海化工厂的产品。这些厂子公私合营以后，仍旧保持了这种关系。但是，在过去这些联系主要是以厂子为单位，原料的互相支援在同行之间一直是互相保密的。因此，苏州的各个化工厂不得不自己派出采购人员长期驻在上海。去年第四季度以前，各厂经常派在上海的人员共有四、五十人之多。这样既不经济，又会发生某些原料有的厂积压、有的厂供应不上等现象。于是，轻工业局组织各厂统一派出八个人在上海联合办公。各厂也可以临时派人到上海去采购原料，但是往往都接受轻工业局的委托，代办其他工厂的一些业务。这些人到上海以后，一般也都同联合办事处接洽，避免发生采购重复等现象。这样就使全市各化工厂的原料得到了比较妥善的解决。
    目前，他们还在积极试制新产品和代用品，以便进一步改善原材料供应情况。三吴化工厂制造香精必需的原料——石炭酸，目前国内严重缺货，他们便决定自己生产石炭酸。现在，三吴化工厂工程师施穆如已经利用呆滞品在实验室试制石炭酸成功，轻工业局拨出了五千元投资，进行基本建设，不久即可投入生产。估计到年底，这个厂就可以生产四十五吨石炭酸，不但可以满足本厂的生产需要，还可以为国家增产十三万元的财富。木工厂听说上海利用木屑生产棋子、玩具，他们也在用木屑试制玩具，以便为国家节约木材。化工厂也准备生产二十多种新品种，克服原料困难，满足市场需要。
    提起原材料供应问题，人们还会想起一些工商业之间扯皮的事情来。去年第二季度，苏州市化工公司刚成立，就要它担负几十个化工厂的原料供应工作。当时，化工公司完不成要货计划，工业部门就要它赔偿损失，闹到市里、省里，弄得彼此不团结，互相不信任。工业部门的要货计划往往订得偏高，商业部门就批上个“无货供应”、“货到供应”或“组织供应”，而不愿积极设法保证工厂的需要。这种意气用事的作法，对于生产一无好处。中共苏州市委和苏州市人民委员会特地召开了双方负责干部座谈会，说明利害，沟通关系。工业部门保证核实需要量，商业部门保证公开库存，共同对生产负责。后来，工商部门又共同召集各厂的供销干部研究了主要产品的原料供应情况，提出哪些原料商业公司可以保证供应，哪些原料需要商业部门克服困难加以解决的，哪些由工业部门自行设法解决，哪些无法解决需要工厂改变产品设计。这样，大家就比较心中有数了。现在，在苏州市工商部门之间已经出现了一种互相体谅、互相帮助的新气象。这对比较顺利地解决原材料供应问题也起了不小作用。
