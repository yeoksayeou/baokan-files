Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Tsinghua University Holds Student Representative Conference
Calls for Students to Be Socialist College Students
More Than 300 Outstanding Students Awarded at the Conference
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch　To be a socialist college student—this was the call made to all students at the Tsinghua University Student Representative Conference held from the 17th to the 19th.
    This representative conference was held after the students throughout the university studied the article "Once More on the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat." Based on the ideological state reflected by the students in studying this paper, the representative conference emphasized that as students of New China, they should learn to correctly use the proletarian stand, viewpoint, and method to analyze all things. They should "be a socialist college student," advocate "marching towards science under the banner of Marxism-Leninism," inherit the excellent revolutionary traditions of Chinese students, eliminate the influence of bourgeois so-called "democracy and freedom," and study diligently for the construction of the motherland.
    The representative conference decided to organize more current affairs lectures in the future to strengthen the study of current affairs and politics; to carry out regular communist moral education through various cultural and recreational activities and discussions of literary works. In addition, it was decided that while strengthening professional studies, it is necessary to help students understand the relationship between learning and construction; to strengthen unity in the classes and help each student progress with the spirit of collectivism. In terms of methods, free discussion should be used, democracy should be fully promoted, and criticism and self-criticism should be carried out to achieve the goal of distinguishing right from wrong.
    At the representative conference, more than 330 outstanding students with excellent academic performance in the last semester were also commended, and they were given certificates of merit.

　　清华大学举行学生代表大会
　　号召作一个社会主义大学生
　　会上有三百多优秀学生受奖
    新华社讯　作一个社会主义的大学生——这是在17日到19日举行的清华大学学生代表大会上向全校同学所提出的号召。
    这个代表大会是在全校学生们学习了“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”一文以后举行的。根据学生们在学习这篇论文中所反映出来的思想状况，代表大会着重指出，作为新中国的学生，应该学会正确运用无产阶级的立场、观点、方法来分析一切事物，要“作一个社会主义的大学生”，提倡在“马克思列宁主义旗帜下向科学进军”，继承我国学生优良的革命传统，清除对资产阶级所谓“民主自由”的影响，为建设祖国刻苦学习。
    代表大会决定今后多组织时事讲座，加强时事政治学习；通过各种文娱活动和对文学作品的讨论，进行经常性的共产主义道德教育。另外还决定在加强专业学习的同时，要帮助同学们认识学习和建设之间的关系；要在班级中加强团结，以集体主义的精神帮助每个同学进步。在方法上要运用自由讨论，充分发扬民主，展开批评与自我批评，以达到明辨是非的目的。
    在代表大会上，还表扬了上学期学习优良的三百三十多个优秀学生，并给他们发了奖状。
