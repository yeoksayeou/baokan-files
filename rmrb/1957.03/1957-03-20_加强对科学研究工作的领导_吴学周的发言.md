Strengthen Leadership in Scientific Research Work
Wu Xuezhou's Speech

I warmly endorse Chairman Mao's speech and Premier Zhou's report, and I agree with the special reports of the leading comrades. I will earnestly study and understand their spirit and apply it to my work.

The call to advance towards science has inspired the enthusiasm of scientific workers nationwide. Subsequently, the long-term plan for science and technology was formulated, which made us more clearly aware of the purpose of our work, increased our confidence in advancing towards science, and strengthened the unity and cooperation between industrial departments, research institutions, and universities. In the past year, the Party and the government have helped scientists reduce administrative affairs and resume research work. Since then, scientific workers' desire to improve their professional skills has become even more urgent. Undoubtedly, these will play a significant role in our country's construction and scientific development.

However, there have been problems in advancing towards science in the past year. Here, I only want to talk about a few issues that I have encountered. The occurrence of these problems is of course inseparable from our insufficient ideological and professional levels, but at the same time, there are other objective reasons.

Our scientific leadership is very weak. Although many new forces have been cultivated in recent years and have taken on the work of intermediate or even senior scientific cadres, they still lack a systematic understanding of the content of their science, even though they have gained considerable work experience in scientific research. Without the help of scientists with higher levels, their work will still have difficulties. At the same time, some experienced old scientists have also had their research work put on hold for many years, or have changed to other relatively unfamiliar new jobs due to the needs of the times. Therefore, to adapt to today's requirements of advancing towards science, a certain preparatory stage is needed. But this work takes a lot of effort and time. This is one aspect. On the other hand, scientific workers have many other tasks besides their professional work: such as organizational leadership work in their units, concurrent positions in related units, and other social activities. This makes them even less able to dedicate enough time to leading research work, thus intensifying the seriousness of the following thoughts.
Ideological Problems in Scientific Research Work and Their Causes

(1) Impatience: As far as I know, most scientific workers, both old and young, work very hard. It is common to work twelve hours a day and not rest on Sundays, or rarely rest. On the surface, everyone works diligently and studies hard, and has no complaints about the Party and the government's considerate care. But inwardly, they are very nervous, deeply feeling the people's eager expectations and their own inability to keep up with the demands of the situation. Some people are impatient and distressed, and some even have the idea of "grabbing anything in a hurry" and being fickle.

(2) The unity of young and old scientific workers: It is in line with the needs of national construction and scientific development for young people to seek progress in their professional skills. However, they often have the shortcomings of being overly ambitious and demanding too much too quickly, unwilling to work steadily and study diligently to train themselves, but only willing to simply learn more theory, believing that this is a shortcut to improvement. They have no experience on the difficult road of science, and this idea is understandable. If we have sufficient academic leadership, then each leader can, based on their own experience and the content and prospects of the research being carried out by young people, patiently persuade them to embark on the correct path, consciously and voluntarily abandon overly ambitious ideas, and establish a style of independent thinking and diligent study. But the problem is that we don't have enough leadership. In some departments, our middle and senior cadres are not clear enough about the direction of their research. Young people demand too much too quickly, but the elderly cannot meet their demands and do not have the ability to persuade them. This creates difficulties in the unity of young and old.

(3) Regarding scientists neglecting politics: Today, among our scientific workers, there are indeed very few who are indifferent to politics. But because they work too much and arrangements are not easy, they often neglect one thing while focusing on another. Therefore, there is a tendency to attach too much importance to professional work, resulting in neglecting politics. At the same time, some political studies are not well arranged. They do not consider the effect and become a mere formality, making the participants feel that they have wasted time and gained nothing. This is also worth improving.

In short, in recent years, especially since the call to advance towards science was put forward, scientific workers have demonstrated high enthusiasm for national construction and scientific development. This is the positive side. At the same time, a series of problems have arisen due to their insufficient ideological and professional levels and various other objective reasons. Today, if we want to solve these problems, if we do not see their positive side, understand their difficulties, and alleviate their problems, but only see their shortcomings and demand too much too quickly, it will not do much good to the facts.

From the above, it can be seen that the ideological problems currently occurring in scientific work are mainly caused by the fact that our academic leadership cannot meet the requirements of the work. These problems arising from work are the most direct and realistic problems for the ideological relations of scientific workers. Therefore, to solve these problems, in addition to our scientific workers continuing to strive to improve their ideological and professional levels, the leadership must also consider the following tasks in strengthening academic leadership.
Ways to Strengthen Leadership and Overcome Shortcomings

(1) Overcome being rushed and chaotic, so that scientists can concentrate on scientific research work. In this regard, since the proposal last year to ensure that scientists spend six-fifths of their time on professional work, it has received attention from all parties and has been supervised and inspected, resulting in great improvements. But there are still problems. For example, among old scientists, there are still quite a few who hold more than a dozen concurrent positions. One old scientist wants to do more research and still has the energy to do research. But he begged the units where he holds concurrent positions, and none of them were willing to let go, making him travel back and forth between Beijing and Tianjin. Some people hold concurrent positions, have their names listed, but do not have time to participate in work and understand the situation, creating a great mental burden. In addition, what affects scientists' work is that the higher-ups give too many ideas and are indecisive. When they hear something good, they want to do it, and after doing it for a while, they want to change it again. It seems that it does not take much effort for the higher-ups to come up with an idea, but when we receive the instructions, we become dizzy. There have been many such examples in the past. In the future, I hope that when arranging work, we should not only consider it from the perspective of form, but also combine it with our specific situation, carefully consider the content, conditions, steps, and effects of the work, and promote and implement it after it is relatively mature.

(2) Pay attention to the further education and training of senior and intermediate scientific cadres. We have not paid enough attention to this in the past. The dispatch of students to study abroad has neither a certain standard nor a certain plan in terms of professional skills. The academic level of the students sent is low, and their work experience is poor. If the study time is too short, they cannot lead the work after returning to China. If it is too long, it is like "distant water cannot quench immediate thirst." At the same time, it also makes senior and intermediate cadres feel that the future is uncertain and their emotions are uneasy. In the future, each agency should consider formulating a system and plan for the rotation of senior and intermediate scientific cadres for further education based on the actual situation. This will not only train a group of higher-level leading cadres in a relatively short period of time, but also improve the enthusiasm of senior and intermediate personnel.

(3) On the rational use of scientific talents: This is the most difficult problem to solve. I remember that when making plans last year, as soon as the issue of personnel transfer was mentioned, the emotions of all parties immediately became tense, and it was impossible to mention it again afterwards. I believe that our main contradiction is not the problem between agencies, but how scientific workers nationwide should contract for our country's science and technology work. Therefore, in the rational use of talents, we should consider the overall situation, take overall account of all factors, and make appropriate arrangements. But this is a very complex problem that cannot be fully resolved in a short period of time. Therefore, in the current situation, we can only adopt the method of consultation and individual adjustment, or better, the method of mutual assistance and cooperation. Last year, someone suggested that scientists could practice "three heads and six arms" style concurrent positions within the scope of their professional work, which solved the problems of several related units. We (the Institute of Applied Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences) and the Department of Chemistry of Northeast People's University have also implemented comprehensive cooperation on the basis of cooperation since 1954. Researchers from both sides consider each other's needs in a consultative manner and make appropriate arrangements, so that they can learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, help each other and benefit each other, and use concurrent positions to solve some of the difficulties of having few people and many things to do. Of course, our cooperation is only preliminary, and it is presented here for reference only.

(4) The issue of adding research institutions: This is closely related to the rational use of talents. In order to meet the needs of important national scientific and technological tasks, it is necessary to establish new research institutions and adjust existing institutions. However, we have not carefully considered the establishment of institutions in the past. Generally, we want to establish a lot of them, and they change too quickly. They are divided soon after being merged, and divided soon after being merged. Today, we think that this is the focus, so we move the research institute here. Tomorrow, we think that that is the focus, so we drag the talents here again. If we establish institutions and adjust institutions based on temporary feelings like this, and move things around, it is still the same stuff. As a result, there will inevitably be many institutions, but they will be empty, and the scientists' energy will be consumed in moving and organizing. Either the new institutions are congenitally deficient, or the old institutions are dragged down. I believe that the establishment of institutions should be carefully considered. We should make overall plans from the perspective of needs and possibilities. We should carefully consider the allocation and training of resources. When resources are insufficient, we should first enrich the existing institutions with a foundation, so that scientists can concentrate on doing some work on the existing foundation and cultivate new forces. When necessary and the conditions are ripe, we will establish new or adjust existing institutions.

I respectfully request your corrections if the above opinions are inappropriate.

### 加强对科学研究工作的领导  吴学周的发言

    加强对科学研究工作的领导
    吴学周的发言
    我热烈拥护毛主席的讲话和周总理的报告，同意各位首长的专题报告，并且要认真学习，体会它们的精神实质，把它应用到工作中去。
    向科学进军的号召鼓舞了全国科学工作者的热情。接着就制订了科技远景规划，这就使我们更明确地认识了自己工作的目的，增进了向科学进军的信心，加强了产业部门，研究机关和高等学校的团结合作。一年来党和政府帮助科学家减少了行政事务，恢复了研究工作。从此，科学工作者要求在业务上进步的心情也更为迫切了。无疑的，这些都将对我国建设和科学发展起着巨大的作用。
    但是一年来在向科学进军中并不是没有问题的。我这里只想就我所接触到的几个问题谈谈。这些问题的发生当然是与我们的思想水平和业务水平不够分不开的，但同时也有着其他客观上的原因。
    我国科学领导力量十分薄弱。几年来虽然培养了不少新生力量，担任了中级或甚至高级科学干部的工作。他们在科学研究上有了不少的工作经验，但是对本门科学的内容还缺少系统的了解，如果没有水平更高的科学家的帮助，他们的工作还不是没有困难的。同时，过去有些经验的老科学家也因为研究工作搁置了多年，或因时势所需改做了其他比较生疏的新工作，因此，要适应今日向科学进军的要求，就需要经过一定的准备阶段。但是这个工作要花费很大的劳力和时间。这是一方面。另一方面，科学工作者除本行业务而外，还有不少的其他工作：如本单位的组织领导工作，有关单位的兼职和其他社会活动等。这样就使他们更没有充分时间来领导研究工作，因而就加深了下面几种思想的严重性。科学研究工作中发生的
  思想问题及其原因
    （1）急躁情绪：据我所知，大多数的科学工作者，不论老少，工作都十分紧张。每日工作十二小时，星期日不休息，或很少休息，是常有的事。表面看来，大家安心工作，刻苦钻研，对党和政府照顾的周到，毫无意见。但内心却很紧张，深深地感觉到人民期待的殷切而自己赶不上形势的要求。有的人急躁、苦恼，有的人甚至产生了“急不择食”，随便乱抓和见异思迁的思想。
    （2）青老科学工作者的团结问题：青年人在业务上要求进步是符合国家建设和科学发展需要的。可是他们往往容易有好高鹜远，要求过高过急的缺点，不肯踏实工作、刻苦钻研来锻炼自己，而只愿单纯地多学理论，认为这才是提高的捷径。他们在科学艰苦的道路上没有经验，这种想法原是可以理解的。如果我们有足够的学术领导力量，那末每个领导人就可以根据自己的经验和青年所进行的研究的内容和前途，与以耐心的说服，使他们走上正确的道路，自觉自愿地扬弃好高鹜远的思想，而建立起独立思考、刻苦钻研的作风。但是问题就在于我们没有足够的领导力量。在有些科门中，我们中、高级干部对自己所研究的方向都不够明确。青年要求过高过急而老年既不能满足他们的要求，又没有能力来说服他们，这样就形成了青老团结上的困难。
    （3）关于科学家忽视政治问题：今天，我们科学工作者当中，对政治漠不关心的确是很少。但也因为他们工作过多，安排不易，抓了东来忘了西。因此，就有把业务看得太重，造成了忽视政治的倾向。同时，有些政治学习也布置得不够好。没有考虑效果，流于形式。使参加的人费了时间，有得不偿失之感。这也是值得改进的。
    总之，几年来，尤其是在向科学进军的号召提出以来，科学工作者在为国家建设和科学发展上，已发挥了很高的热情。这是积极的一面。同时也因为他们的思想和业务水平不够以及其他种种客观原因而产生了一系列的问题。在今日要求得这些问题的解决，如果不看到他们积极的一面，体谅他们的苦衷，解除他们的困难，而只看到他们的缺点，要求过高过急，对事实是没有多少好处的。
    由上所说，可以看出目前科学工作中所发生的思想问题，主要是因为我们学术领导力量不能满足工作的要求产生的。这些从工作中产生的问题是对科学工作者的思想关系最为直接、最为现实的问题。因此，要求这些问题的解决，除我们科学工作者还应继续努力提高思想水平和业务水平而外，在领导方面还必须在加强学术领导力量方面，考虑以下的几个工作。加强领导，克服缺点的途径
    （一）克服忙乱，使科学家能集中精力从事科学研究工作。在这方面自去年提出要保证科学家以六分之五的时间用于业务后，已受到了各方的重视，并作了督促检查，有了很大的改进。但还不是没有问题。例如在老科学家中有十几个兼职的还不在少数。有位老科学家很想多做研究，而且还很有精力来做研究。可是他向兼职单位央求，个个不肯放松，弄得他仆仆风尘，奔走于京津道上。有些人兼了职，挂了名，没有时间去参加工作，去了解情况，造成精神上的很大负担。此外影响科学家的工作的，是上级主意出得太多，摇摆不定。听了好事就要做，做了不久又要改。上级出个主意好像不费气力，我们收了指令却弄得头昏眼花。这样的例子过去不少。今后希望布置工作时，不要专从形式来考虑，而是要结合我们的具体情况，慎重考虑了工作的内容、条件、步骤和效果，比较成熟后才推动执行。
    （二）注意高、中级科学干部的进修与培养。我们过去对此注意不够。派遣留学生在业务上既无一定标准，也无一定计划。所派学生学术水平低，工作经验差。留学时间短了，回国后不能领导工作。长了，远水救不了近火。同时也使高、中级干部感觉到前途茫茫，情绪不安。今后各个机关应可根据实际情况，考虑订出高、中级科学干部的轮流进修制度和计划。这样不但可在较短的时间内培养一批水平更高的领导干部，而且同时也可以提高高、中级人员的积极性。
    （三）关于科学人才的合理使用问题：这是最不容易解决的问题。记得去年做规划时，一提到调动人员问题，各方情绪便登时紧张起来，以后就无法再提。我认为，我们的主要矛盾不是机关与机关之间的问题，而是全国科学工作者如何来包干我国科技工作的问题。所以在人才的合理使用上，应从全局观点来考虑统筹兼顾，适当安排。但是这又是一个非常复杂而一时得不到全盘解决的问题。因此在目前情况下，只有采取协商的方式，进行个别调整的办法，或更好的，是互助合作的办法。去年有人建议科学家可在其本行业务范围内实行“三头六臂”式的兼职，解决了几个有关单位的问题。我们（中国科学院应用化学研究所）和东北人民大学化学系，在从1954年起合作的基础上，也实行了全面合作。双方研究人员以协商的方式来考虑彼此的需要，与以适当的安排，这样就能取长补短，互助互利，用兼职来解决人少事多的部分困难。当然，我们的合作还只是初步的，在此提出仅供参考。
    （四）增设研究机构问题：这是与人才的合理使用有密切关系的。为满足国家重要科学技术任务的需要，新设研究机构和调整机构是必要的。但是我们过去设立机构并没有经过审慎的考虑。一般都想设立得很多，而且变动得太快。分了不久又合，合了不久又分。今天认为这里是重点，就把研究所搬到这里。明天认为那里是重点，就又把这里的人才拖到那里。像这样光凭一时感觉来设立机构，调整机构，倒来倒去，还是这点东西。结果必至弄得机构很多，内容空虚，使科学家的精力消耗于播迁和组织。不是新的机构先天不足，就是老的机构被拉垮了。我认为：设立机构要经过审慎的考虑。要从需要与可能来全面打算。要审慎考虑力量的分配和培养。在力量不够时，应该首先去充实已有基础的机构，使科学家能在已有的基础上，集中精力来做些工作，培养出新生力量。等到必要和条件成熟时，再行新设或调整。
    以上的意见是否有当，敬请指正。
