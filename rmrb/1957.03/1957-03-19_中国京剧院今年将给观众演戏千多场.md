    China Peking Opera Theatre to Perform More Than a Thousand Shows for Audiences This Year
    (Our Newspaper News) This year, the China Peking Opera Theatre will frequently meet audiences on domestic stages. The four troupes under its leadership are excavating and sorting out a large number of excellent traditional old operas, and will also rehearse some new dramas with experimental and demonstrative significance.
    Famous actors from each troupe will first select and rehearse their signature plays. Ye Shenglan's "Shuang He Yin" has already been performed publicly and is now being restaged as "Yaguan Lou." The plays "Borrowing Zhao Yun" and "Jiulong Mountain," which Ye Shenglan, Li Shengzao, and Li Hongchun have sorted out, will also be performed one after another. In addition to the recently newly staged "Mulan Joins the Army," Du Jinfang is also preparing to sort out old plays such as "Mulberry Garden Meeting" and "Jinshui Bridge." The historical drama "Nanguan Cao" adapted from Guo Moruo's original work (script by Fan Junhong and Lü Ruiming, directed by Zheng Yiqiu) is a large-scale new play that the First Troupe is focusing on rehearsing this year, and will meet the audience in May. Another major play, "Yanmen Pass" (parts one to eight), almost includes all the actors of the First Troupe. The role of Empress Dowager Xiao in the play is currently difficult to find on the Peking Opera stage, and it has now been decided that Xue Yanqin will play the role.
    The Second Troupe is currently re-organizing "Three Mountains" in terms of script, music, and performance. This play caused a sensation when it was staged last year, but was suspended due to the actors going abroad. It will be restaged at the end of this month. Zhang Yunxi, Zhang Chunhua, Yun Yanming, Li Zongyi, Li Huifang, Wang Quankui, Ye Shengchang, Jing Rongqing, and others will continue to cooperate this year in performing a large number of group plays such as "Daming Prefecture," "Jianghan Fishermen's Song," "Three Steals of the Nine Dragon Cups," "Complete Tongtian Rhinoceros," and "Buddha's Hand Orange," and will also rehearse several large-scale new plays such as "Wangniang Tan," "Two Wolves Mountain," and "Fan Lihua."
    Yuan Shihai intends to create different performance arts for the Water Margin hero Li Kui in different plays. These days, he is working day and night at his home rehearsing the new play "Li Kui Visits His Mother," which he and Weng Ouhong wrote. The late old artist Gao Qingkui's masterpiece "Crying at the Qin Court" has not been seen on the stage for many years, and recently his disciple Li Hezen has re-presented it to the audience. Yuan Shihai and Li Hezen will also co-star in "Green Plum Wine Heroes." New plays rehearsed by the Third Troupe include "Wangjiang Pavilion," "Xu Yanzhao Kills His Son," and "Mr. Dong Guo." The martial arts play "Baicao Mountain," sorted out by Yan Shishan, will soon be performed.
    Although the Fourth Troupe has only been performing for a short time, it has received good reviews from the audience. The new plays and key plays that they are rehearsing this year include a total of 20 plays such as "Battle of Feishui," "Breaking Ji and Accepting Zhen," and "Huai'an Prefecture."
    In the past few years, the heavy task of foreign visits and performances has prevented the China Peking Opera Theatre from meeting domestic audiences frequently. This year, all the main actors of the academy are in China. The academy has decided to concentrate its efforts on rehearsing and performing. The annual performance plan of each troupe has been preliminarily determined, with the least being 240 shows and the most being 270 shows. The four troupes will perform more than 1,000 shows for domestic audiences. In addition to the public performances in theaters in Beijing, the Second Troupe will go to Tianjin for a short performance; the Third Troupe will go to Xi'an, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Chongqing, Wuhan, Shijiazhuang and other cities for a tour performance; the Fourth Troupe will also go deep into the troops for consolation performances.

    中国京剧院今年将给观众演戏千多场
    本报讯　中国京剧院今年将在国内舞台上经常与观众见面。它所领导的四个剧团正在发掘、整理大批优秀传统老戏，并将排演一些带有实验示范性的新剧目。
    各剧团著名演员都将首先选排自己的拿手好戏。一团叶盛兰的“双合印”已经公演，现正重排“雅观楼”。叶盛兰和李盛藻、李洪春整理的“借赵云”“九龙山”等戏也将陆续演出。杜近芳除了最近新排的“木兰从军”以外，还准备整理 “桑园会”、“金水桥”等老戏。根据郭沫若原著改编的历史剧“南冠草”（范钧宏、吕瑞明编剧，郑亦秋导演）是一团今年重点排演的大型新剧，5月间可与观众见面。另一个大戏一至八本“雁门关”几乎包括了一团全体演员，剧中萧太后是目前京剧舞台上很难物色的角色，现已决定由雪艳琴担任。
    二团目前正在从剧本、音乐和表演等各方面重新整理“三座山”。这个戏去年上演曾轰动一时，后因演员出国而停演，本月底它又将重演。张云溪、张春华、云燕铭、李宗义、李慧芳、王泉奎、叶盛长、景荣庆等今年将继续合作演出“大名府”、“江汉渔歌”、“三盗九龙杯”、“全部通天犀”、“佛手橘”等大批群戏，并将排演“望娘滩”、“两狼山”、“樊梨花”等几个大型新戏。
    袁世海有意于创造水浒英雄人物李逵在不同戏里的不同的表演艺术，这几天在他家里正在日夜赶排他和翁偶虹编写的新戏“李逵探母”。已故老艺人高庆奎的拿手杰作 “哭秦庭”已多年不见于舞台，最近已由他的弟子李和曾重新献给观众。袁世海和李和曾还将合演“青梅煮酒论英雄”。三团新排剧目有 “望江亭”、“徐延昭斩子”、“东郭先生”等。阎世善整理的武旦打出手戏“百草山”等不久就可演出。
    四团公演时间虽然还很短，已在观众中获得好评。他们今年排演的新戏和重点整理的剧目共有“淝水之战”、“破冀纳甄”、“淮安府”等二十个。
    过去几年，繁重的出国访问演出任务，使得中国京剧院不能经常同国内观众见面。今年全院主要演员都在国内。院方决定集中力量一面排戏，一面演出。各剧团全年演出计划已经初步确定，最少的是二百四十场，最多的是二百七十场。四个剧团将为国内观众演出一千多场。除了在北京的剧场公演以外，二团将去天津短期演出；三团将到西安、兰州、成都、重庆、武汉、石家庄等城市作巡回公演；四团还将深入部队作慰问演出。
