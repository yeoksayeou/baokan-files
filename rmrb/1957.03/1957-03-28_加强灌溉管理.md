Strengthen Irrigation Management
By Our Newspaper Commentator

　　The nation's irrigated area has now expanded to 500 million mu. Under normal circumstances, paddy fields with irrigation facilities yield 100 to 200 jin more than rain-fed fields, and irrigated land yields one to two times more than dry land. Therefore, doing a good job in irrigation management is one of the important tasks for striving for a bumper agricultural harvest this year. The tasks of irrigation management are: to properly manage irrigation facilities, maximize their effectiveness, closely integrate them with agricultural measures, carry out rational irrigation, improve soil fertility, and ensure high and stable agricultural yields.

　　Last year, driven by the high tide of agricultural production, irrigation management work in many regions achieved considerable results. In Shaanxi Province, due to the close integration with agricultural measures and further strengthening of irrigation management, the average wheat yield in all state-owned irrigation areas increased by 10% compared with 1955, cotton increased by 18.3%, and rice increased by 12.9%. At the same time, the irrigated area expanded from more than 2.28 million mu to more than 2.84 million mu. In Chenjia Long and Hejia Long advanced cooperatives in Liling County, Hunan Province, due to strengthening irrigation management organizations, implementing dedicated water release, and unified adjustment of waterways and rational irrigation, the drought resistance capacity of the cooperatives' water conservancy facilities generally increased by ten to twenty days. Thanks to dedicated water release, 2,800 water watchmen were saved in one year, and it also ensured irrigation water for 90% of the area that was changed from intercropping rice to continuous cropping rice, or single-season rice to double-season rice, thereby increasing yields.

　　However, irrigation management work has not yet fully adapted to the rapid increase in irrigated area and the changes in production relations after the agricultural advanced cooperativization. Some agricultural cooperatives do not yet have sound water conservancy organizations, and the masses in newly developed irrigation areas still lack the habit and experience of using water. Many irrigation facilities have not yet established permanent management organizations or dedicated personnel. This requires all localities to further take effective measures to strengthen irrigation management.

　　Strengthening irrigation management mainly relies on agricultural cooperatives to improve basic-level water conservancy organizations, vigorously improve irrigation technology, promote advanced irrigation methods, and do a good job in water storage and conservation. Relying on agricultural cooperatives is the basis for doing a good job in irrigation management. However, since most agricultural cooperatives have been established recently and lack experience in collective water management and use, it is necessary to provide them with practical assistance. First, they should be helped to establish and improve water conservancy management organizations, so that someone in the cooperative is responsible for leading irrigation work and formulating irrigation and project maintenance systems. Irrigation personnel should be fixed, and their work responsibilities, quality requirements, and payment methods should be clearly stipulated to prevent them from simply pursuing irrigated area for more work points and neglecting irrigation quality. In new irrigation areas lacking water use experience and habits, it is also necessary to actively help cooperatives train water conservancy technicians, impart relevant water management and use techniques and knowledge, and exchange some effective successful experiences that are suitable for local conditions.

　　Improving irrigation technology and promoting advanced irrigation methods are also very important. Practice has proven that furrow irrigation and ridge irrigation for dryland crops, and rational, frequent, and shallow irrigation for rice are good ways to increase production and also important measures to prevent salinization of irrigated land. In Shaanxi Province, furrow irrigation was implemented on large areas of corn and cotton, with high-yield corn exceeding 1,000 jin and cotton (seed cotton) exceeding 600 jin. In the Yellow River irrigation area of ​​Henan, 96% of the wheat land implemented ridge irrigation, which also significantly increased production. After Sichuan, Guangdong, Guangxi and other provinces promoted rational, frequent and shallow irrigation of rice, yields all increased. Therefore, actively promoting the above-mentioned irrigation methods is the main aspect of improving irrigation technology. In order to promote advanced irrigation methods, agricultural cooperatives should properly arrange work such as leveling land, digging ditches, making ridges, and building field ridges.

　　In the past few years, many large-scale irrigation areas have implemented planned water use, which has generally achieved good results in increasing production and saving water. All localities should continue to promote it according to engineering and technical conditions.

　　After agricultural cooperativization, land is connected into continuous areas, and some irrigated areas have already been mechanized. The field canals built during the small-scale peasant economy era can no longer adapt to current farming requirements. The old irrigation system must be rebuilt accordingly to create material conditions for further improving irrigation technology.

　　Water storage and conservation are also important tasks at present. More than half of the area in the southern rice irrigation area relies on water storage projects such as ponds and small reservoirs. However, because many areas suffered drought last winter, ponds and reservoirs have very little water storage, and some are even dry. In order to ensure water for spring plowing, it is necessary to overcome complacency, store water in a timely manner, and pay attention to water conservation.

　　加强灌溉管理
　　本报评论员
    目前全国灌溉面积已发展到五亿亩。在一般情况下，有灌溉设施的稻田比天水田增产一百斤至二百斤，水浇地比旱地增产一倍至二倍以上。因此，做好灌溉管理工作，是争取今年农业大丰收的重要工作之一。灌溉管理的任务是：正确管理灌溉设施，发挥它的最大效能，紧密结合农业措施，进行合理灌溉，提高土壤肥力，保证农业高产稳收。
    去年在农业生产高潮的推动下，灌溉管理工作在许多地区获得不少成绩。陕西省由于密切结合农业措施，进一步加强灌溉管理工作，全部国营灌区的小麦平均产量较1955年提高10％，棉花提高18.3％，水稻提高12.9％，同时灌溉面积从原有的二百二十八万多亩扩大到二百八十四万多亩。湖南省醴陵县陈家垅、何家垅两高级社，由于加强了灌溉管理组织，实行专人放水，统一调整水路、合理灌溉，使社内水利设施的抗旱能力一般提高了十天到二十天。由于专人放水，一年内省了看水工二千八百个，并且保证了去年90％的面积由间作稻改连作稻，或单季稻改双季稻的灌溉用水，提高了产量。
    但是，灌溉管理工作还不能完全适应灌溉面积的迅速增加和农业高级合作化后生产关系的改变。有些农业社还没有健全的水利组织，新发展的灌溉地区，群众还缺乏用水的习惯和经验，不少灌溉设施还没有建立经常性的管理组织或专管人员。这就要求各地进一步采取有效措施，加强灌溉管理工作。
    加强灌溉管理，主要是充分依靠农业社，健全基层水利组织；大力提高灌溉技术，推行先进的灌溉方法，并做好蓄水保水工作。依靠农业社，是做好灌溉管理的基础。但由于大多数农业社建成不久，缺乏集体管水用水的经验，因此就必须给以切实的帮助。首先应该帮助他们建立和健全水利管理组织，使社内有人负责领导灌溉工作，制定灌水和工程养护的制度。灌水人员应当固定，他们的工作责任、质量要求和付酬办法，应当有明确的规定，防止他们为了多得工分而单纯追求灌水面积，忽视灌水质量。在缺乏用水经验和习惯的新灌区，还应该积极帮助各社培养水利技术人员，传授有关管水用水的技术和知识，交流一些行之有效的适合当地情况的成功经验。
    提高灌水技术，推行先进的灌溉方法，也很重要。实践证明，旱作物的沟灌、畦灌，水稻的合理勤浇浅灌，是增产的好办法，也是防止灌溉土地盐碱化的重要措施。陕西省大面积的玉米、棉花实行了沟灌，高额产量玉米在千斤以上，棉花（籽棉）在六百斤以上。河南引黄灌区96％的麦地实行了畦灌，也显著地增了产。四川、广东、广西等省推行水稻合理勤浇浅灌以后，产量都有提高。因此积极推行上述灌水方法，是提高灌水技术的主要方面。为了推广先进的灌溉方法，农业社对于平整土地、开沟、打畦及修筑田埂等工作，应当好好安排。
    过去几年中不少大型灌区实行计划用水，普遍获得了增产又省水的良好效果，各地应该根据工程及技术条件，继续推行。
    农业合作化后，土地联片，有些灌区部分土地已经机耕，在小农经济时期兴修的田间渠道，已不能适应目前耕作要求，旧有灌溉系统必须相应改建，为进一步提高灌溉技术创造物质条件。
    蓄水保水，也是当前重要任务。南方水稻灌区有二分之一以上的面积是依靠塘坝、小水库等蓄水工程。但因去冬不少地区遭受干旱，塘、库蓄水很少，有的甚至干涸了。为了保证春耕用水，必须克服麻痹大意，及时蓄水，注意保水。
