Xinhua News Agency News: The Chinese Communist Party Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau Committee is vigorously leading the bureau's staff and workers to overcome various ideological obstacles in the movement to increase production and practice economy, so as to further deepen the movement throughout the bureau.

In the past two weeks or so, the Chinese Communist Party Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau Committee held several meetings in succession to review the previous stage of the movement to increase production and practice economy. A large amount of information shows that the engineering bureau has achieved certain results in the movement to increase production and practice economy in the past two months, and the new atmosphere of "diligence and thrift is glorious, waste is shameful" has begun to take shape. However, on the whole, the movement has not been carried out widely and deeply enough, and the direction is not clear enough. Many employees in the movement paid more attention to saving, but paid less attention to improving business management, improving project quality and ensuring construction safety; from the perspective of the development of the movement, the construction department is better, and the functional departments are worse, and some departments have basically not moved. As a result, phenomena such as idling and rushing work often occur in the project, and safety accidents and quality accidents are gradually becoming serious. In particular, the number of safety accidents that have occurred in the past two months is rare since the entire Yangtze River Bridge project started.

After repeated study of the above situation, the local Party Committee believes that the basic reason why the bureau's movement to increase production and practice economy is not extensive, in-depth, and comprehensive is that ideological education has not been carried out well, so that many erroneous ideas that hinder the healthy development of the movement have not been vigorously criticized. Among these erroneous ideas, in addition to not fully understanding the principles of the movement, the most prominent is the relatively serious complacency from top to bottom. Many leading cadres in the Party and administration rarely go deep into the masses to understand the situation and study problems, and often only give orders from above or ask lower-level cadres to report. Compared with the previous stage of the Yangtze River Bridge project, the spirit of leading cadres to work diligently is much worse. Among the engineering and technical personnel, many people have also begun to be unwilling to go to the construction site. A more common view is that the most difficult problems in the project have been solved, and the remaining work can be solved by ordinary technicians and foremen, and it is no longer necessary to go to the construction site frequently. Among the workers, especially the young workers, a complacent mood of "not caring about everything" has also emerged. People with this mood have begun to pay little attention to operating procedures and even violate labor discipline. All of these have greatly restricted and weakened the enthusiasm and creativity of the staff and workers to increase production and practice economy.

In response to the aforementioned situation, the Engineering Bureau Party Committee decided to continue to carry out ideological education, and proposed to educate employees to overcome complacency and other erroneous ideas by recalling and comparing based on different situations, and adopting typical criticism and commendation of advanced methods. The Engineering Bureau Party Committee pointed out that because the project has begun to enter the final stage, the focus of increasing production and practicing economy should be placed on ensuring project quality and construction safety; accelerating project progress and saving raw materials can only be considered and arranged on the premise of not affecting quality and safety. At present, relevant publicity and education work is being gradually carried out throughout the bureau.

### 武汉长江大桥工程局党组织决定加强政治思想教育　克服增产节约中的麻痹松劲情绪

　　武汉长江大桥工程局党组织决定加强政治思想教育
　　克服增产节约中的麻痹松劲情绪
    据新华社讯　中共武汉长江大桥工程局委员会正大力领导全局职工克服增产节约运动中的各种思想障碍，使增产节约运动进一步在全局范围内深入地开展起来。
    最近半个多月来，中共武汉长江大桥工程局委员会曾接连几次召开会议，对前一阶段的增产节约运动进行检查。大量情况说明了：两个多月来这个工程局的增产节约运动是获得了一定成绩的，“勤俭光荣、浪费可耻”的新风气已经开始形成。但是就整个来说，运动还开展得不够广泛和深入，方向也不够明确。不少职工在运动中较多地注意了节约，而对改善经营管理、提高工程质量和保证施工安全，却注意得较差；从运动的发展面来看，施工部门好些，职能科室比较差，有的科室还基本上没有动起来。结果，工程中窝工、抢工的现象都时常发生，而安全事故和质量事故也随着逐渐严重。特别是安全事故，近两个多月来出现次数之多，是整个长江大桥工程开工以来所少见的。
    这里的中共党委在反复研究了上述情况以后，认为全局增产节约运动开展得不广泛、不深入、不全面的基本原因，是思想教育工作进行得差，使许多妨碍运动健康发展的错误思想没有受到有力的批判。而这些错误思想中，除对运动的方针领会不全面外，最突出的是从上到下都存在着较严重的麻痹松劲情绪。不少党和行政方面的领导干部，很少深入到群众中去了解情况和研究问题，往往只是在上面发号施令或叫下层干部来作汇报。和长江大桥工程开工的前一阶段比较起来，领导干部兢兢业业地对待工作的精神是差得多了。在工程技术人员中，也有许多人开始不愿去施工现场。一种比较普遍的看法是：现在工程中最难解决的问题都已经解决了，剩下的工作，普通技术员和领工员就能解决，经常到施工现场已经没有必要。在工人中，特别是青年工人中，也已经出现“事事满不在乎”的麻痹情绪。有这种情绪的人，开始不大注意按操作规程办事，甚至破坏劳动纪律。这些，都在很大程度上限制和削弱了职工群众增产节约的积极性和创造性。
    针对前述情况，工程局党委确定继续开展思想教育工作，并且提出了根据不同情况，发动群众回忆对比和采取典型批判、表扬先进等方式，教育职工克服麻痹松劲和其他错误思想。工程局党委指出：由于工程已经开始进入收尾的阶段，增产节约重点应该放在保证工程质量和施工安全方面；加速工程进度和节约原材料只能在不影响质量和安全的前提下来考虑和安排。目前，有关的宣传教育工作正在全局范围内逐步开展。
