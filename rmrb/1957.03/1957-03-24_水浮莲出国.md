Water Hyacinth Goes Abroad

　　This newspaper reports that Guangdong Province's water hyacinth will grow in countries such as Albania and Burma this year. The Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture has recently sent a batch of water hyacinth seeds in accordance with the agreement established between relevant departments of China and Albania. This is the second time water hyacinth has gone abroad; last year, Moscow also received water hyacinth from Guangdong.

　　Domestically, the area where water hyacinth grows will also be expanded this year. Not only will many provinces in Jiangnan and East China continue to cultivate it, but also the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest regions are also preparing to propagate it. According to the relevant负责人 from the Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture, the large quantity of water hyacinth seeds they prepared were quickly distributed, and many units from other provinces are still requesting them. In order to further meet the needs of various provinces in the country, the Department of Agriculture plans to organize the propagation of seedlings in the suburbs of Guangzhou, and it is expected that water hyacinth seedlings will be supplied to various places as much as possible at the end of April and the beginning of May.

　　Water hyacinth is a fast-growing, high-yielding green fodder suitable for pig raising. In the past, propagation with seedlings was difficult to transport and overwinter. This year, the problem of propagation with seeds has been solved, which is more conducive to promotion. (Liang Desheng)

　　水浮莲出国
    本报讯　广东省的水浮莲今年将在阿尔巴尼亚、缅甸等国生长。广东省农业厅已经按照中阿两国有关部门订立的协定，最近送去了一批水浮莲种子。水浮莲出国，这是第二次；去年，莫斯科也从广东得到了水浮莲。
    在国内，水浮莲生长的地区，今年也要扩大。不仅江南和华东的许多省要继续栽培，新疆维吾尔自治区和东北、西北、西南等地区也准备繁殖。据广东省农业厅的有关负责人说，他们准备的大量水浮莲种子很快就分光了，现在还有许多外省的单位来索取。为了进一步满足国内各省需要，农业厅计划在广州市郊区组织繁殖种苗，预计在4月底、5月初尽量供应各地水浮莲种苗。
    水浮莲是生长快、产量高、适合养猪的青饲料。过去用种苗繁殖，既难运输，又难过冬。今年解决了用种子繁殖的问题，更有利于推广。　（梁德胜）
