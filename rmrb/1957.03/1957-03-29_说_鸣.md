Amidst the sound of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," there are still calls for "speaking out against injustice." This is not strange. "Injustice" reflects the existence of contradictions of a certain nature, and "speaking out" is a demand for and promotion of the resolution of certain contradictions.

From a global perspective, we face two types of contradictions with different natures, and therefore two types of "injustice" with different natures. This determines that our "speaking out" must also be different.

Today, the contradiction between us and the enemy internationally is sharp, thus arousing many "unjust events." For example, last year's invasion of Egypt by British and French colonialists, and the current attempt by American imperialism to continue to implement a colonialist policy of aggression in the Middle and Near East, are all "great injustices" in the world today. We must "right these injustices," we must "speak out," and we must "speak out" with the force of wind, rain, thunder, and lightning. For example, the American imperialists' occupation of our territory Taiwan and their refusal to allow our students studying in the United States to return home to participate in national construction are also "great injustices." We must never tolerate them, we must "speak out," and we must "speak out" with the roar of dragons and tigers overturning mountains and seas, to "strengthen our own morale and destroy the enemy's prestige."

As for the people internally, the situation is fundamentally different, but since there are still contradictions between correct opinions and incorrect opinions, and there are still contradictions of partial interests, there are inevitably some "minor injustices" amidst the "greater good." For example, in the wage reform, in the work of evaluating grades and setting salaries, one often hears of the problem of "great fairness, minor injustices." And in personnel arrangements, it is also difficult to achieve perfection. Situations of using people with skills that are not needed or using great talent for small purposes are sometimes unavoidable. As for the bureaucratic, subjectivist, and sectarian errors of some comrades, they can cause some temporary or local "unjust" events. Therefore, we must also "speak out" to promote the "fairness" of things.

Regarding the "injustices" within the people, we must not only "speak out," but also demand "speaking out well." "Speaking out well" means paying attention to methods and means, and paying attention to the effect of "speaking out."

Some comrades see some kind of "unjust" event within the organs, feel "indignant," and dare to "speak out against injustice," which is of course a manifestation of a sense of justice and responsibility. However, sometimes it also produces radical emotions. Some even often want to regard themselves as the flower monk Lu Zhishen and the black whirlwind Li Kui, and want to "chop down injustice with an axe" and "kill all unjust people with a precept knife." I think the spirit of eagerness to help others and righteousness of heroes like Lu Zhishen and Li Kui is worthy of our learning and promotion, but their axes and precept knives need not be used today. Because the society they lived in was the world of the feudal exploiting classes, with jackals everywhere and justice not being extended, so Dou E in the Yuan Dynasty drama "Dou E Wronged" issued such a cry to the heavens and the earth before her execution: "Earth, why are you earth if you don't distinguish between good and bad? Heaven, why do you wrongly make heaven if you mistakenly examine the virtuous and the foolish!" — Before such "great injustices," heroes and good men who liked to "right injustices" had to make such earth-shattering "thunder." However, in today's society, the people's democratic system itself is incompatible with "unjust" events, and the socialism and communism we are building take the complete elimination of all large and small "injustices" as the goal of struggle. At present, there may also be some temporary and local "injustices," but with the Communist Party in charge, as long as we "speak out well," we will eventually get the due effect. Therefore, there is no need to make earth-shattering "cries," nor is there a need for earth-shattering "thunder." We should neither "whitewash peace" nor use precept knives and axes to "fight injustice."

Within the people, so-called "speaking out well" ultimately means making suggestions, which means being good at using the weapons of criticism and self-criticism. Therefore, complaining and saying strange things cannot be called "speaking out well." An ancient saying goes: "The birds chirp to seek their friends' voices." I think: within the people, using "friendly voices" to make "speaking out against injustice" is still beneficial to socialism, beneficial to the unity of the people, and helps to transform "injustice" into "fairness."

### 说“鸣”

    说“鸣”
    张啸虎
    在“百家争鸣”声中，尚有“不平则鸣”的呼声。这没有什么奇怪。“不平”反映了一定性质的矛盾的存在，“鸣”是要求和促成某种矛盾的解决。
    从世界范围来说，在我们面前有两种性质不同的矛盾，因而也有两种性质不同的“不平”，这就决定我们的“鸣”也是有所不同的。
    今天国际间敌我之间的矛盾是尖锐的，因而激起了很多“不平事”。比如，去年英、法殖民主义者侵略埃及，目前美帝国主义企图在中、近东继续推行殖民主义的侵略政策，这都是当今世界上“大不平”之事，我们要“打抱不平”，要“鸣”，而且要作风雨雷霆之“鸣”。又如，美帝国主义者霸占我国的领土台湾，不许我国留美学生回国参加祖国建设，这也是“大不平”之事，我们绝不能容忍，要“鸣”，而且要作龙吟虎啸排山倒海之“鸣”，要“长自己志气，灭敌人威风”。
    至于人民内部，情况当然根本不同，但既然还有正确意见和错误意见的矛盾，还有局部性质的利害矛盾，“大公”之中就不可避免地还有某些“小不平”之事。比如，在工资改革当中，评级定薪工作上，就常听说有“大公小不平”的问题。而在人事安排上，也很难做到尽善尽美。用非所学或大才小用的情况，有时也在所难免。至于某些同志的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义的错误更能造成某些暂时的或局部的“不平”事。因此，我们也要“鸣”，以促成其事之“平”。
    对于人民内部的“不平”，不但要“鸣”，而且要求“善鸣”。“善鸣”就是要求讲究方式方法，要注意“鸣”的效果。
    有的同志看见机关内部有某种“不平”之事，感到“愤愤不平”，敢作“不平之鸣”，这当然是有正义感和责任感的表现。但是，有时也产生偏激情绪。有的甚至还往往要以花和尚鲁智深和黑旋风李逵自许，要来个“板斧砍翻不平事”，“戒刀杀尽不平人”。我觉得鲁智深和李逵这些好汉们那种急公好义的精神是值得我们学习和发扬的，但他们的板斧和戒刀倒不必再用于今日。因为他们所在的社会，是封建剥削阶级的天下，豺狼遍地，正义不伸，所以，元人杂剧“窦娥冤”中的窦娥在临刑前才发出那样呼天号地的“哀鸣”：“地也，你不分好歹何为地？天也，你错勘贤愚枉做天！”——而在这样一些“大不平”之前，好“打抱不平”的英雄好汉们，才不得不发出那样翻天复地的“雷鸣”。但是，在我们今天的社会，人民民主制度本身就是和“不平”事不相容的，而我们所建设的社会主义和共产主义，则是以彻底消灭一切大小“不平”为奋斗目标。在目前，也可能有某种暂时的和局部的“不平”，但有共产党作主，只要我们“善鸣”，终究会得到应有的效果的。所以，既不必作呼天号地的“哀鸣”，也不需有翻天复地的“雷鸣”。我们既不要“粉饰太平”，也不要用戒刀板斧来“打不平”。
    在人民内部，所谓“善鸣”，归根结底，就是提意见，就是善于运用批评和自我批评的武器。因此，发牢骚，说怪话，就不能叫“善鸣”。古语说：“嘤其鸣矣，求其友声”。我想：在人民内部，以“友声”来作“不平之鸣”，还是有利于社会主义，有利于人民团结，有助于化“不平”为“平”的。
