　　Weeding and Protecting Seedlings
　　Fang Zheng
    A farmer weeding in the field is a very delicate art. Some intellectuals who go to the countryside to work often cannot distinguish between weeds and seedlings when they go to the field to weed with the farmers. And even if they can distinguish them, if they don't handle the hoe skillfully, they will inevitably uproot the seedlings with one stroke, leaving the weeds behind.
    The situation in the literary and art field is similar. It is difficult to imagine a simple and easy way to remove weeds. If accidentally hoeing a seedling in the field only means losing a few ears of grain in the future harvest, then in the literary and art field, accidentally hoeing a seedling will scare other seedlings into automatically shrinking back and not growing anymore. Of course, the opposite can also happen: leaving a weed behind will encourage new weeds. So this problem is really not simple!
    It is inevitable to run into snags when trying to solve complex problems with simple and easy solutions. Moreover, if each seedling is doomed to be hoed simply because it does not grow exactly as you imagine it should, then there is little hope for a good harvest in the entire field.
    Of course, I don't mean to discourage our critics with these words. Weeds must be removed, and seedlings must be protected; the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is beyond doubt. But the key is that, precisely because the situation is complex, we are required to be careful discriminators and appropriate critics. A diligent and clever farmer will not hang up his hoe because of what I have said.

　　锄草与护苗
　　方正
    农夫在田里锄草，这是一桩很精细的艺术。有些知识分子下乡工作时，同农民一起下地锄草，就往往分不清哪是草，哪是苗。而且即使分辨出来，如果锄头的运用不是得心应手的话，也难免一锄头铲掉了苗，而留下了草。
    在文艺这块园地上，情形也正相仿。你很难设想出一种简单省事的办法来清除莠草。如果说在田地里，误锄了一株禾苗，也不过就是在未来的收获中损失几穗谷，那么在文艺园地上，误锄了一株禾苗，却会吓得其他一些禾苗也都自动缩回头去不再生长了。当然，相反的情形也会有的：留下了一根莠草，就会鼓舞一些新的莠草。所以这问题真是不简单！
    对于不简单的事情想用简单省事的办法来解决，总难免是要碰壁的。更不待说，如果一株株禾苗，只因为生长得不完全如你想像的那样子，便难逃你一锄头的话，那么，这整块田地的丰收是难有希望的了。
    当然，我这番话并不是要我们的批评家知难而退。莠草必须清除，禾苗必须保护；百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针不容怀疑。但问题的关键在于，唯其因为情况复杂，所以就要求我们做细致的鉴别者和恰如其分的品评家。勤劳而聪明的农夫是不会因为我这一番话而挂起锄头的。
