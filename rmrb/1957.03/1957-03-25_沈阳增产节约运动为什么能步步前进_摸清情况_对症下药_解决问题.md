　　Shenyang Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement Can Advance Step by Step
　　Ascertain the Situation, Prescribe the Right Remedy, and Solve Problems
　　(Our dispatch) Our reporter, Lu Hao, offers the following commentary on the current Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in Shenyang City:
　　Each factory has found ways to increase production and practice economy starting from its specific circumstances.
　　This year's Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in Shenyang City has been developed step by step after relatively thorough investigation and research, targeting the different situations of each factory and adopting different measures. Superficially, it does not seem as grand as in previous years, but in essence, it is more in-depth and detailed than in the past. For a long time in 1956, Shenyang City focused on solving quality problems as the main content of the advanced producer movement. Due to the lack of specific leadership for each factory at that time, the movement seemed less effective. Since this spring, the shortage of raw materials has been a common difficulty for all factories. Therefore, how to conserve raw materials has become a key issue for many factories. The Shenyang Municipal Committee has learned from past experiences and repeatedly required each factory to ascertain the situation based on its specific conditions, then prescribe the right remedy and solve problems. Some factories have started by modifying designs and processes to save raw materials without affecting quality; some factories are actively researching substitutes because the imported raw materials have been reduced. Some factories are focusing on improving quality and reducing the reject rate. For example, the number of rejected steel castings at the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant and the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant was very high last year. The total number of rejects at the Heavy Machinery Plant reached more than 2,400 tons, and the number of rejects at the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant was more than 900 tons. Reducing the reject rate has become an important issue for these two factories to increase production and practice economy this year. This approach has yielded significant results. The average reject rate at the Heavy Machinery Plant last year was 6.27%, which has dropped to 3.79% in January and February this year. The reject rate at the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant has also begun to decline. With the development of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, the level of enterprise management has also improved to some extent.
　　The measures of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement are concentrated within the entire plan of the factory.
　　This year's Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in Shenyang City is closely integrated with the formulation of the entire plan of the factory. This has blocked many false loopholes and made the plan for increasing production and practicing economy based on a solid foundation. In previous years, factories here often made two plans: after the production plan was set, they would make another plan for increasing production and practicing economy. But in reality, cost accounting was still one ledger, one unit had one algorithm, and one person calculated in one way. It was difficult to clearly determine how much production was actually increased and how much was saved in the accounts. Because there were two plans, some people found it difficult to go all out when making the production plan. They were unwilling to set their own plan for increasing production and practicing economy too low, so the authenticity of the entire production plan was inevitably affected to some extent. This year, the task of increasing production and practicing economy in Shenyang City was proposed earlier. Therefore, after each factory formulated the production plan, they did not make another plan for increasing production and practicing economy. Instead, they used the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy to repeatedly formulate and discuss the production plan. This production plan, which was formulated through the combination of factory leaders and the masses of workers, has become a concentrated expression of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement. According to the original plan, the copper smelting workshop of the Shenyang Smelter did not need to spend much effort this year to reduce costs by 351,257 yuan. Later, because the factory's plan to reduce costs could not be completed, the factory asked them to reduce costs by another 150,000 yuan. The workshop leaders calculated that, in addition to accepting the task of reducing costs by 150,000 yuan, they could also reduce costs by another 9,800 yuan. Even so, the factory's task of reducing costs could not be completed. The leaders of the copper smelting workshop again held a forum with veteran workers to discuss how to further reduce costs. Their calculations showed that they could continue to reduce costs by 41,983 yuan. Finally, the workshop held an economic activity analysis meeting, and the calculation was discussed and verified among all the workers in the workshop. Everyone believed that costs could be further reduced by 32,973 yuan. At this point, the copper smelting workshop can reduce costs by more than 580,000 yuan for the country this year. This figure is 66% higher than the original initial plan to reduce costs. When formulating the factory's production plan, the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy is貫串, and the plan is placed on a unified, concentrated, and reliable foundation.
　　The Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement is combined with the scientific advancement of engineering and technical personnel.
　　This year's Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in Shenyang City pays great attention to mobilizing engineering and technical personnel, combining the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement with the scientific advancement of engineering and technical personnel, and combining it with improving the technical management level of factories. This year, the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant announced more than 100 topics directly related to production to the entire plant, attracting and promoting the scientific research work of the plant's engineering and technical personnel. Twenty-two items have now been realized, and only three of them can save the country 460,000 yuan in one year. Many factories go deep into the users to visit, collect the usage of old machines in production in the past, and then modify the design and process according to actual needs. The Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant saved steel that could be used to make another 160 such machine tools in a year by only modifying the process of 256 types of 1K36 machine tool parts. Because engineering and technical personnel have further contact with users and the actual situation, some factories have designed several new things that improve performance and improve quality. The Shenyang Agricultural Machinery Plant organized engineering and technical personnel to study and improve the design of the T8-2A-24 seeder, so that it also has the use of the BYB148 seeder, and saved steel. After the 300-horsepower air compressor of the Shenyang Air Compressor Plant increased the air displacement, every 13 such machines produced is equivalent to an increase in production of one machine. Although improving product performance cannot directly bring any economic benefits to the factory, the meaning of its savings is very significant from the perspective of the overall national interest. The engineering and technical personnel of some factories have close cooperation with scientific research institutions and brother factories and mines, and scientific research work has been better developed.
　　Some factories have insufficient enthusiasm for the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, and the modification of designs is not cautious enough.
　　Judging from the overall situation of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in Shenyang City, the development of the movement is normal and healthy. However, the movement must be carried out more widely, deeply, and powerfully. Because the state plans of some factories have not yet been issued, and the supply of raw materials is still very difficult, the leaders of some factories believe that it is difficult to carry out the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement. Therefore, in some factories, the movement is progressing slowly and the enthusiasm is not enough. The leaders of some factories one-sidedly understand the meaning of full reliability, and as a result, they are timid and shrink back. Although they have been criticized repeatedly, some of them can only see the immediate positive factors, and cannot consider all the positive factors that can be achieved but must be worked hard to achieve. Therefore, the scale and momentum of the movement have also been affected to a certain extent. The product quality of some factories has declined, and the quality is still not very stable. The production indicators of some factories are still very backward. Individual factories have achieved some success in modifying designs, modifying processes, and saving raw materials, but in individual products, because they are not cautious enough, there have been shortcomings in which the product quality has been affected due to improper modification. Although this is only just beginning to show, it should also be paid attention to. (Attached picture)

It is estimated that 6,400 hard alloy knives can be saved throughout the year. This is a worker discussing how to use old knives. Xinhua News Agency reporter Tie Han photo.

　　沈阳增产节约运动为什么能步步前进
　　摸清情况　对症下药　解决问题
    本报讯　本报记者陆灏对沈阳市当前的增产节约运动评述如下：
    各厂从具体情况出发找到增产节约的途径
    今年沈阳市的增产节约运动是在进行了比较充分的调查研究工作之后，针对着各个工厂的不同情况，采取不同措施，逐步发展起来的。从表面上看，它不像往年那样轰轰烈烈，但骨子里却比过去要深入和细致些。1956年很长一段时间，沈阳市曾以解决质量问题为中心作为先进生产者运动的主要内容，由于当时对各厂缺乏具体领导，运动就显得不够有力。今春以来，原材料不足是各个工厂的共同困难，因而如何节约原材料便成了很多工厂的关键性问题。沈阳市委接受了以往的教训，一再要求各个工厂根据自己的具体条件，摸清情况，然后对症下药，解决问题。有的工厂在不影响质量的前提下，从修改设计、修改工艺着手节约原材料；有的工厂因为进口的原材料减少了，积极研究代用品。有的工厂着重提高质量降低废品率。如去年沈阳重型机器厂和沈阳第一机床厂钢铁铸件的废品数都很高，重型机器厂的废品总数达二千四百多吨，第一机床厂的废品数是九百多吨，降低废品率便成为这两个工厂今年增产节约的重要问题。这样做收效就比较显著。重型机器厂去年平均的废品率是6.27％，到今年1、2月份已下降到3.79％。第一机床厂的废品率也已开始下降。随着增产节约运动的发展，企业管理工作的水平也有了一些提高。
    把增产节约运动的措施集中表现在工厂整个计划之内
    今年沈阳市的增产节约运动是和制订工厂整个计划紧紧地结合在一起的，这样就堵塞了很多虚假的漏洞，使增产节约的计划建立在踏踏实实的基础上。往年这里的工厂常常订两个计划：在生产计划订好之后，再订一个增产节约计划；但实际上成本财务还是一个帐本，一个单位一个算法，一个人算成一种样子，实际究竟增产节约了多少，账目是很难弄得很清楚的。因为有了两个计划，有些人在订生产计划的时候就难以全力以赴，他们不愿意把自己的增产节约计划订得太低，因而整个生产计划的真实性难免就要受到一定的影响。今年沈阳市增产节约任务提出较早，因而各厂在编制生产计划后，就不另订一个增产节约计划，而是用增产节约的精神，一而再、再而三地制订和讨论生产计划。这种经过工厂领导和职工群众相结合讨论制订出来的生产计划，就成为增产节约运动的集中表现。沈阳冶炼厂铜熔炼车间按照原来的计划，他们今年用不着费很大的气力，就可降低成本三十五万一千二百五十七元，后来因为全厂降低成本的计划完不成，厂方又要求他们再降低成本十五万元，车间领导干部计算了一下，觉得除了可以接受降低成本十五万元的任务外，还可以再降低成本九千八百元。就是这样，全厂降低成本的任务还是无法完成。铜熔炼车间的领导干部又找老工人开座谈会，商量如何进一步降低成本，他们算帐的结果，认为还可以继续降低成本四万一千九百八十三元。最后，车间举行了经济活动分析会议，在全车间的职工中进行了讨论核算，大家认为还可以再降低成本三万二千九百七十三元。至此，铜熔炼车间今年总共能为国家降低成本五十八万多元。这个数字比原来最初计划降低成本的数字增加了66％。在制订厂的生产计划的时候，贯串增产节约的精神，把计划放在统一、集中、可靠的基础上。
    使增产节约运动同工程技术人员的科学进军相结合
    今年沈阳市的增产节约运动十分注意发动工程技术人员，把增产节约运动与工程技术人员的科学进军相结合，与提高工厂的技术管理水平相结合。沈阳矿山机器厂今年向全厂公布了和生产直接有关的一百多项课题，吸引和推动了全厂工程技术人员的科学研究工作，现已实现了二十二项，仅其中三项，一年内能为国家节约四十六万元。很多工厂深入到用户中去访问，实地收集过去老机器在生产中的使用情形，然后根据实际需要修改设计，修改工艺。沈阳第三机床厂仅修改了二百五十六种1K36机床部件的工艺，一年节约的钢材，可以再做一百六十台这样的机床。由于工程技术人员和用户和实际之间有了进一步的联系，这就出现了有的工厂设计出若干改进性能、提高质量的新东西来。沈阳农业机械厂组织工程技术人员研究改进T8—2A—24型播种机设计的结果，使其同时具有BYB148型播种机的用途，又节约了钢材，沈阳空气压缩机厂的三百马力空气压缩机提高了排风量以后，每生产十三台这样的机器，就等于增产一台。提高产品性能虽然不能直接给工厂带来什么经济效果，但从整个国家利益来说，其节约的意义是很重大的。有的工厂的工程技术人员和科学研究机关、兄弟厂矿密切合作，科学研究工作有了较好的开展。
    某些厂增产节约运动劲头不足，修改设计不够慎重
    就目前沈阳市增产节约运动总的情况来看，运动的发展是正常的，健康的。但运动还必须更广泛更深入和更有力地开展。由于有些工厂的国家计划还没有下达，原材料的供应还十分困难，因而有的工厂的领导者认为很难开展增产节约运动。所以在某些工厂，运动进展迟缓，劲头不够。有些工厂的领导者，片面地理解了充分可靠的意义，结果就畏缩不前，虽然一再受到批判，但他们有的还是只能看到眼前的积极因素，而不能考虑可以达到的但必须努力争取才能达到的一切积极因素，因此运动的规模和声势也受到了一定的影响。有的工厂的产品质量有下降的现象，质量仍旧不大稳定。有的工厂的生产指标还很落后。个别工厂在修改设计、修改工艺，节约原材料方面已经取得了一些成就，但在个别产品上，因为不够慎重，发生了因为修改不当而影响了产品质量的缺点，这虽然只是刚刚露了一点头，但也应引起注意。（附图片）
