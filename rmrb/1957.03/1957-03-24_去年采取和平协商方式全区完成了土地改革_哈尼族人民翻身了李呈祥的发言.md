　　The entire region completed land reform last year through peaceful consultation.
　　The Hani people have been liberated. Li Chengxiang's speech.
    I first express my gratitude for the great ethnic policy of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. I am a member of the Hani ethnic group from Yunnan Province. The Hani people are a minority ethnic group among the many minority ethnic groups in the country. They live in compact communities along the Honghe River in the border region of Yunnan in our motherland. Historically, they have been subjected to feudal rule and the oppression and exploitation of the Kuomintang, leading to extreme poverty and a very low level of culture. In 1949, the Communist Party came and led the people to overthrow the ruling class, eliminate the remnant forces of the Kuomintang, and the people gained the right to be masters of their own affairs, and their lives were greatly improved. In 1956, in response to the strong demands of the people of all ethnic groups, under the leadership of the higher-level Party and government, and with the consent of upper-class ethnic figures, land reform was completed throughout the region through peaceful consultation. A total of more than 88 million jin of land production was confiscated and distributed to landless and land-poor peasants, with an average of about 600 jin of land production per person. Landlords and landowners also received a share of land like the peasants. Along with this, thirty-four elementary cooperatives were established, and the organizational scope of mutual aid has reached 70%. Through ideological education during the reform, the unity between ethnic groups has been greatly strengthened. Due to the correct implementation of the peaceful consultation method in the reform, the lords and landlords have been taken care of and educated. Some have served in important positions in the autonomous region government and departments, some have served in county, district, and township positions, and some have even received living subsidies. Therefore, the lords and landlords have eliminated their fears of struggle that they had before the land reform and have written letters calling on relatives who were lured away by spies and fled abroad to return to the motherland to live a family reunion life. However, there are still shortcomings in our work, such as the promotion of ethnic minority cadres is not enough, and among the ethnic upper-class people who participate in the work, many have multiple children, and the elderly and children lack labor, have heavy burdens, and the actual difficulties in life have not been resolved. In addition to our efforts to solve this problem, please pay attention to and take care of this issue from the higher-level government. In the early days of liberation in our region, there were still more than 200 chieftains and headmen who fled abroad and lived in Thailand, Laos, and South Vietnam. Because they did not understand the policy, they dared not return and wandered in foreign lands. I once again explain to them and let them know that the Party's policy will not change, and that they should return as soon as possible to reunite with their families and live a happy and fulfilling life. In the past, I was one of the ruling classes in my ethnic group. Since joining the government in 1951, under the Party's continuous training and education, I deeply feel that labor is glorious and exploitation is shameful. I voluntarily gave up the privileges of the Tusi and served the people. In the future, I will work more diligently and conscientiously and do a good job. I will also sincerely support, earnestly study, and implement the brilliant teachings of Chairman Mao that I heard at this session of the Supreme State Conference and the report of Chairman Zhou that I heard at the Third Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference into my own ethnic group. Finally, I wish the conference success and all the members good health! (With picture)

　　去年采取和平协商方式全区完成了土地改革
　　哈尼族人民翻身了李呈祥的发言
    我首先感激中国共产党毛主席的伟大民族政策，我是云南省的一个哈尼民族，哈尼族又是全国少族民族中的一种少数民族，聚居在祖国云南边疆红河沿岸，历来受到封建统治和国民党的压迫和剥削，生活极其贫困，文化又甚低落，1949年共产党来临，领导着人民推翻了统治阶级，消灭了国民党残余势力，人民得到了当家做主的权利，生活大大改善；1956年应各族人民的强烈要求，在上级党和政府的领导下及民族上层人物的同意下，采用和平协商方式完成了全区土地改革，共没收了八千八百多万斤产量的土地，分给无地和少地的贫苦农民，每人平均分得了六百斤左右产量的土地；领主和地主也和农民一样分得了一份土地。随着建立了初级合作社三十四个，互助的组织面已达70％，通过改革中的思想教育，民族之间的团结大大有了加强，在改革中由于正确的贯彻了和平协商方式，领主和地主都受到了照顾和教育，有的担任了自治区政府及科室中的重要职务，有的担任县区乡的职务，有的还得到了生活上的补助。因此，领主和地主已消除了他们在土改之先怕斗争的顾虑，都写信叫过去被特务诱惑逃跑外国的亲人归回祖国过家人团聚的生活。但是我们的工作还存在着缺点，如民族干部的提拔还不够多，民族上层参加工作的人中，有多子女的，老人、小孩都缺乏劳动力，负担重，实际生活上的困难还没有得到解决，除我们设法解决外，请上级政府加以注意和照顾。我区在解放初期，逃往国外住在泰国、老挝、南越的土司头目还有二百余人，因不了解政策不敢回来，流浪异域。我再一次向他们解释，让他们知道党的政策是不会变的，早日归回和家人团聚过幸福美满的生活。过去我是本民族中统治阶级之一，自五一年参加政府工作以来，在党的不断培养和教育之下，深深的感到劳动光荣，剥削可耻，自动放弃土司特权，为人民服务，今后更要兢兢业业勤勤恳恳将工作做好，并要将这次列席最高国务会议上所听到毛主席的英明教导及出席全国政治协商会议二届三次会议上所听到周主席的报告，诚心拥护，认真学习，贯彻到本民族中去。最后，祝大会成功，各位委员身体健康！（附图片）
