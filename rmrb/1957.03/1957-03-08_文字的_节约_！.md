    "Economy" in Writing!
    Gao Yan
    We advocate "economy" in our work and life, and there are similar requirements for the use of words and sentences in writing. To write well, one must work hard to experience life and think deeply to write "pertinently." After writing, it should be repeatedly revised to achieve "conciseness." However, our common problem in writing is not being good at compressing, not being able to achieve
  "Shorter! Shorter still!" In other words, it is not "economical" enough, often running into thousands of words, which is lengthy and tedious. The writer wastes words, and the reader wastes time. Writing should follow this principle: unnecessary words, sentences, and paragraphs should be resolutely discarded; what is optional should be deleted or compressed as much as possible, without any regret.
    You can't write a good article without hard work. You have to go through full ideological labor, use your heart to ponder and revise. Wang Anshi, a poet of the Song Dynasty, wrote a quatrain: "Jingkou and Guazhou are separated by a river, Zhongshan is only separated by several mountains, the spring breeze has turned the south bank green again; when will the bright moon shine on my return?" The word "green" in the third line was written after five revisions. At first, it was written as "to," then changed to "pass," then to "enter," then to "fill," and finally to the word "green." He spent more time revising the article than writing it, and he was not ambiguous at all. The depth of the ancients' efforts can be imagined. Li He, a poet of the mid-Tang Dynasty, has a line in a poem: "Reciting poetry all night, the east is white." In order to write poetry, he thought deeply and recited all night long, writing and writing until he didn't know that the east had turned white. These ancient people's serious and conscientious writing attitude of racking their brains and working hard is worthy of our learning. Some people say: "So-and-so has talent, and when writing, he doesn't add a single point and finishes it in one go." He even compares himself to the ancients who "write ten thousand words a day, waiting by the horse!" I say he is "boasting."
    Writing articles requires repeated refinement to squeeze out "moisture," opposing verbose and lengthy, un-"economical" writing. When Ouyang Xiu of the Song Dynasty was in the Hanlin Academy, he went out with his colleagues one day and happened to see "a running horse killing a dog on the road." Ouyang Xiu asked this colleague to record this matter. The colleague said, "A dog was lying on the main road, and a runaway horse trampled it to death." Ouyang Xiu criticized him for being too verbose and said, "If you were to write history, ten thousand volumes would not be enough." Meaning that if he were to write history, I am afraid ten thousand volumes would not be enough to contain it all. Ouyang Xiu only wrote: "A runaway horse killed a dog on the road." He recorded this matter with almost half the number of words as his colleague. This should serve as a warning to those of us who write articles and waste words without any regard for economy!
    In today's advocacy of "economy," we should also refine our writing and use of words and sentences in the spirit of "economy," so that the articles we write can become sharp "daggers," and prevent turning the articles into thick and dull "kitchen knives"!

### 文字的“节约”！

    文字的“节约”！
    高炎
    在我们工作和生活中提倡“节约”，写文章的用字、句也有同样的要求。写文章要下苦工夫去体验生活深思熟虑才能写得“中肯”。写完后要经过反复修改，才能作到“简练”。但是我们写文章一般的毛病是不长于压缩，不能作到
  “短些！再短些！”也就是不够“节约”，常常动辄数千言，冗长乏味，写的人浪费了文字，看的人浪费了时间。写文章应该遵循这样的原则：不需要的字句、段落，坚决不要；可有可无的、要尽可能删掉，或压缩，毫不可惜。
    写文章不下苦工夫，就写不出好文章来，要经过充分的思想劳动，用心血去琢磨、修改。宋朝王安石的绝句：“京口瓜州一水间，钟山只隔数重山，春风又绿江南岸；明月何时照我还？”第三句中的“绿”字，是经过五次修改，才写成的。开始写的是“到”，后改为“过”，又改为“入”，又改为“满”，最后才改为“绿”字的。他在文章的修改上，比写作时间还多，一点不肯含糊。古人用功之深，可以想见。中唐诗人李贺有一句诗：“吟诗一夜东方白”。为了写诗，深思熟虑，彻夜长吟，写来写去不知东方已白。这些古人绞尽脑汁严肃认真下苦工的写作态度，是值得我们学习的。有人说：“某某人具有才华，写文章时，文不加点，一挥而就。”甚至比拟古人所谓“日试万言，倚马可待！”我说他是“吹牛”。
    写文章要千锤百炼挤去“水分”，反对浮泛冗长不“节约”的文字。宋朝欧阳修在翰林院时，一天与同事出游，在路上恰好看到“有奔马毙犬于道。”欧阳修就请这位同事把这件事记下来，这个同事说：“有犬卧通衢，逸马蹄而死之”。欧阳修批评他这句话太累赘了，便说：“使子修史，万卷未已也。”意思是说，让他写历史的话，恐怕万卷也写不完。欧阳修只写：“逸马杀犬于道。”他记述这件事，几乎比他的同事节省一半的字。这件事对我们写文章毫不顾惜笔墨浪费文字的人，足以为诫！
    在提倡“节约”的今天，我们写文章、用字句，也要本着“节约”精神多加锤炼，写出来的文章才能成为一把锋利的“匕首”，切防把文章制造成一把既厚又钝的“厨刀”！
