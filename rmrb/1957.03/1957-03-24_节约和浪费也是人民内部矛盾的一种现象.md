　　Thrift and Waste are also a Phenomenon of Internal Contradictions Among the People

　　Xiao Zuolin said that in our minds, there must be more or less ideological class struggle, and it is very common and obvious that this is reflected in the contradiction between thrift and waste.

　　I would like to talk about some of the more prominent extravagant and wasteful phenomena that currently exist, which also reflect a kind of contradiction within our people. Our enemies are ridiculously running around telling each other that we ourselves admit that there are contradictions within our people, and they are greatly elated. We do admit that there are some contradictions within our people, that is true, but their elation is wrong, because the current contradictions within our people are not only not antagonistic contradictions, but also some of the developing factors that are promoting our progress. Unfortunately, they will not understand this. They will continue to see all kinds of contradictory phenomena constantly appearing within our people, and at the same time they will only ever see us constantly moving forward and developing. As for them, we can only tell them that this is the way it is. However, for ourselves, we must naturally constantly discover and resolve existing contradictions in development, in order to promote our own continuous progress.

　　We all know that the so-called socialism is actually very simple in meaning, that is, the people jointly carry out production, and constantly increase production endlessly on the basis of constantly improving technology, so as to continuously improve the people's material and cultural life. In order to continuously expand reproduction, we must rely on the accumulation of funds within the people themselves, because socialism neither exploits internally nor plunders externally, so naturally the people themselves must carry out appropriate savings on the principle of constantly and moderately improving their lives. Therefore, increasing production and practicing thrift should be understood as an important principle and basic method for building socialism. During the period when our country is building socialism, the process of completing our first five-year plan has also specifically embodied this principle, which is an undeniable main aspect. At the same time, we should also see the opposite side, the side of extravagance and waste that still exists quite commonly and is caused by the complacency of having completed the first five-year plan. It should be pointed out that this contradictory phenomenon is essentially a reflection of the class struggle in people's ideology. Although we have basically eliminated exploitation, and have basically changed the class contrast and class relations, the class struggle in ideology cannot but exist, and it must go through a certain period of time. Moreover, due to the long-term influence of the old society, even in the minds of the working class and even some Communist Party members, it is impossible for anyone not to have a trace of bourgeois or petty-bourgeois consciousness, or for anyone to be absolutely immune from the erosion of bourgeois ideology. Therefore, it should be admitted that in the minds of each of us, there must be more or less ideological class struggle, which is very common and obvious as reflected in the contradictory phenomenon of thrift and waste. There are many specific examples.

　　Based on what I have seen, heard, and personally experienced in participating in urban construction management work in recent years, there have been quite a few wasteful facts in capital construction. For example, in the thrift campaign in 1955, because some designs excessively omitted some things that should not have been omitted, and construction inevitably over-shortened where things should have been long, many projects could not guarantee quality, some had to be reworked, some cracked soon after completion, and some simply could not play their proper role, resulting in an even greater waste that was difficult to estimate. In 1956, when opposing conservatism, there was a tendency to only pay attention to progress and disregard cost and quality. Although the central government put forward clear requirements for more, faster, better, and more economical and safe work, there were still many serious phenomena of only paying attention to progress, being greedy for more and faster work, and simply pursuing profit turnover without regard to project quality and worker safety. In some enterprises, there were even individual despicable acts of cutting corners, which fully demonstrated the shameful ideas of capitalist management. As a result, quality and safety accidents of all sizes occurred in large numbers in some projects, causing the state to suffer many incalculable huge losses. At the same time, the expression of departmentalism is generally quite significant. Some construction units even disregarded and did not care for old and sick workers because their labor force was weak and their productivity was low, and only wanted to push them out, while other units were equally unwilling to accept them. If this is the case for people, especially for workers who are the leading class of the country, then the manifestation of other departmentalist practices can naturally be imagined, and the waste caused by departmentalism is also difficult to estimate. In short, "left" leaning opportunism and right-leaning conservatism are both fundamental enemies of increasing production and practicing thrift. In addition, some leading cadres do not pay much attention to investigation and research, do not understand the specific situation, and inevitably have a bit of bureaucracy. Naturally, they will inevitably rely only on their own subjective ideas, which is reflected in the fact that decisions or plans are inevitably somewhat divorced from reality. Or, in some investment aspects, they fail to properly distinguish the importance and urgency of different projects. Some have been invested in and built but have little effect for the time being, while others urgently need to be built but have no funds to invest. Or, in project management, they fail to correctly distinguish the primary and secondary key points. Things that should be saved are not saved, while things that should not be saved are saved. In addition, the plans are delayed, slow, and change frequently at each level, seriously affecting the necessary preparatory work and construction organization measures of grassroots construction units, resulting in a great waste. All these waste phenomena, which have appeared in capital construction and still exist to a certain extent, should be said to be reflections of some non-proletarian ideologies to varying degrees.

　　Our various levels of state organs have too many setups, too large establishments, and unnecessary premature over-specialization, with layers upon layers and numerous organs. In reality, this inevitably leads to overstaffing and people being busy with each other's affairs, which reduces work efficiency and increases the huge waste of human and financial resources. This is inevitably close to extravagance and is inseparable from the idea of some leading cadres who only talk about pomp and disregard reality. We should also particularly point out that some leading comrades (including some senior cadres, both Party and non-Party) have also gradually developed a tendency towards luxury and enjoyment in their lives. They want to live in particularly spacious and elaborate houses, and cars must be dedicated and graded according to their age. No matter how far or near the road is, no matter whether the matter is public or private, a car is always a must. Things like this, although only a very few people show this tendency, because these people are leading cadres, the influence inevitably makes many other cadres follow suit, which leads to some unhealthy trends of demanding positions, treatment, grades, and wages. Although this unhealthy trend is not big, it cannot be taken lightly, because these things are clearly reflections of bourgeois ideology to some extent.

　　The current tension in various aspects such as market supply, school capacity, and urban public facilities is mainly due to the general and continuous increase in people's economic income, which leads to a great increase in the demand for improved living standards. This is very natural. The socialist economic law is to constantly meet the growing demands of the people for improved living standards. The people will always constantly feel from insufficiency to satisfaction, and from satisfaction to insufficiency in endless cycles. This is the inevitable law of development. However, many of us have the idea of completely realizing a highly socialist life in one morning, so we feel that this is not enough and that is not enough. We are even unwilling to look back at the kind of life before liberation and compare it. This kind of impetuous mood that only relies on personal fantasies and disregards objective reality is incompatible with the important socialist principle of increasing production and practicing thrift. At the present stage, we must mainly concentrate human and material resources on constantly expanding reproduction as much as possible, and after socialism is built, we must still constantly expand reproduction under the principle of constantly and moderately improving living standards. Therefore, the principle of increasing production and practicing thrift must be implemented for a long time, and some one-sided and excessive demands that are divorced from reality, disregard long-term interests, and demand planned, focused, comprehensive, balanced development in improving living standards are wrong. In essence, this is precisely a reflection of the petty-bourgeois ideology that still exists relatively commonly.

　　In general, it can be said that socialist ideology is now in a dominant position in our ideology, but it cannot be denied that petty-bourgeois and bourgeois ideologies still exist and function to varying degrees, which inevitably leads to broader and deeper ideological class struggles, and it should even be said that even Communist Party members are inevitably included to a certain extent. This is reflected in the contradictory phenomena in many aspects of the people's internal affairs, and is more universally and significantly reflected in the contradictory phenomenon of thrift and waste. However, because we have completely established a solid material foundation for socialism, and socialist ideology is already the dominant aspect of our ideology, this internal contradiction is no longer an antagonistic one, but only a certain process phenomenon that is constantly transforming, and it will inevitably only realize a complete qualitative change more and more rapidly, which is completely understandable. However, after all, we cannot deny, and everyone should pay special attention to and be vigilant about their own struggles in this process. This is a rather long-term and also the final arduous struggle.

　　Generally speaking, class struggle cannot but be very fierce and cruel. However, any contradiction can be transformed under certain conditions, antagonistic contradictions can be transformed into non-antagonistic contradictions, and class struggle can be expressed in various different forms of struggle, and can also gradually achieve complete transformation and qualitative change through the form of peaceful transformation, especially in ideological class struggle. Therefore, class struggle is not a terrible thing, as long as people have awareness and constantly improve their awareness, the transformation of contradictions in class struggle will inevitably develop in a regular manner. The reason why our country's petty bourgeoisie and bourgeoisie can and have basically mastered their own destiny is this principle. Facts have proved that this is very natural. The same is true for the category of democracy and freedom. As long as people have awareness and constantly improve their awareness, they can naturally enjoy their due and unrestricted genuine democracy and freedom. People are actually always bound by their own limitations, and in the end, only they can truly liberate themselves. Socialism lies in the fact that people will all liberate themselves, and thereby liberate all mankind. There are no other more profound principles. I myself used to be differentiated from the reactionary ruling class, but now I feel that I am truly liberated, because I deeply feel that I fully and freely enjoy the democratic rights and personal freedom that I should enjoy. Due to my personal experience, I deeply understand what the contradictions that exist within our people now are, and these internal contradictions will not exist for long. Compared to yesterday, today is not bigger, but much smaller. And I also believe that even the antagonistic contradiction existing in the Taiwan issue is not absolutely impossible to transform. As long as the military and political authorities in Taiwan have national awareness, Taiwan will also be able to achieve peaceful liberation, and many external conditions and some internal factors existing within the Taiwan authorities themselves are constantly increasing this possibility and will eventually become a reality.

　　The above is my opinion, please criticize and correct it. (Attached picture)

### 节约和浪费也是人民内部矛盾的一种现象

　　节约和浪费也是人民内部矛盾的一种现象
    萧作霖说，在我们的头脑中，都不能不是或多或少的存在着意识形态上的阶级斗争，反映在节约和浪费这个矛盾的现象上也是非常普遍和明显的。
    我想谈谈当前较突出存在的某些铺张浪费的现象，这也正是反映着我们人民内部的矛盾的一种现象。我们的敌人正在那样十分可笑地奔走相告，说我们自己也承认我们存在有人民内部的矛盾，而大为兴高彩烈。我们的确承认存在有人民内部的某些矛盾，这是真的，但是他们的兴高彩烈可就错了，因为当前我们的人民内部的矛盾，不但不是什么对抗性的矛盾，并且还正是促使我们前进的一些发展因素，可惜这在他们不会懂得。他们还将继续可以看到会不断出现在我们人民内部的各式各样的矛盾现象，同时他们也将永远只能看到我们在不断前进和发展，以对他们而说，我们只能告诉他们就是这么回事。但是，对于我们自己而说，自然我们就必须从发展中不断发现和解决存在的矛盾，以促使我们自己不断前进。
    我们都知道，所谓社会主义，其实意义很简单，就是人民共同进行生产，并在不断提高的技术基础上无止境的不断增产，从而不断提高人民的物质生活和文化生活。而为了不断扩大再生产，必须依靠人民自己内部来积累资金，因为社会主义是对内既无剥削，也不向外掠夺的，自然就只有人民自己在不断适度地提高生活的原则下来适当进行节约。因此，增产节约应该被理解为是建设社会主义的一个重要原则和基本方法。我国正在建设社会主义时期，从我们完成第一个五年计划的过程看来，也已经具体体现了这个原则，这是不可否认的主要的一面。同时我们也应该看到相反的另一面，还相当普遍地存在着的并因实现了第一个五年计划的自满情绪所产生的某些铺张浪费的一面。应该指出，这个矛盾现象，在实质上就是人们意识形态上的阶级斗争的反映。虽然我们已经基本上消灭了剥削，也就基本上改变了阶级对比和阶级关系，但是在意识形态上的阶级斗争，还不能不是存在着的，也必然地还得经过一个一定时期。并且由于旧社会的长期影响，即在工人阶级乃至一些共产党员的头脑中，也不可能无论谁都没有一丝一毫资产阶级或小资产阶级意识的残余痕迹，或谁都绝对不会受资产阶级思想的侵蚀的。因此应该承认，在我们每个人的头脑中，都不能不是或多或少的还存在着意识形态上的阶级斗争，即以反映在节约和浪费的这个矛盾现象上也就非常普遍和明显，具体事例是很多的。
    以我几年来于参加城市建设管理工作中，所见所闻和亲身体会在基本建设方面产生过的某些浪费事实就很不少。如在1955年的节约运动中，由于有些设计上过多地省掉了一些不应该省掉的东西，到施工上又不免过多地节长约短，使得不少工程不能保证质量，有些要返工，有些不多久就出现破裂，还有根本就不能起应有作用的，结果是反而造成了难以估计的更大浪费。到1956年的反保守，又产生了只顾进度不顾成本和质量的偏向，虽然中央提出了多、快、好、省和安全的明确要求，还是有不少只顾进度贪多图快和单纯追求上缴利润而不顾工程质量和工人安全生产的严重现象。在有些企业中，还个别地有过不惜偷工减料的卑劣行为，这更充分表现了资本主义经营的可耻思想。因而在有些工程上大量出现大大小小的质量事故和安全事故，使国家遭受了许多不可估算的巨大损失。同时，本位主义的表现一般也相当显著，甚至有些企业的施工单位，因嫌老病工人的劳动力弱生产率低而漠然不加顾恤，只想推送出去，别的单位却也同样不愿接收。对人，特别是对作为国家领导阶级的工人都如此，其他本位主义的作风表现，自然就更可想而知，而由于本位主义所导致和造成的浪费，也是难以估计的。总之，“左”倾机会主义和右倾保守主义的倾向，都是增产节约的根本大敌。此外，还由于有些领导干部不大重视调查研究，不大了解具体情况，既不免有点官僚主义，自然也就不会不只凭自己的主观一套，这就表现在决定或制订计划上的不免有些脱离实际。或在某些投资方面区别轻重缓急不得当，有投资兴建了的而暂时作用不大，有迫切需要兴建的而又已无资可投。或在工程管理方面未能正确分清主次关键，有该省的没有省，有不该省的却省了。还有计划下达的层层拖延迟缓和多变，严重影响基层施工单位应有的准备工作和施工组织措施，因而造成的浪费也很大。所有这些，仅以在基本建设方面出现过并还一定程度地存在着的一些浪费现象而说，应该说就不同程度地都是某种非无产阶级思想的反映。
    我们的各级国家机关的设置过多，编制过大，还不太必要的过早地分工太细，层层叠叠，机关林立，实际上不免造成人浮于事和人忙人的现象，反而降低了工作效率和增加了人力财力的巨大浪费，这未免是近于铺张，而与某些领导干部的不顾实际只讲排场的思想分不开的。我们还应该特别指出，有些领导同志（包括党与非党的某些高级干部）还在生活上也逐渐滋长了奢侈享乐的倾向，房子要住得特别宽大和讲究一些，汽车要专用还要论新旧，路不问远近，事不分公私，反正一概非汽车不行。诸如此类。而这种虽然还只是极少数人所表现的倾向，却因为这些人是领导干部，影响所及，不免使得较多的其他一些干部尤而效之，也就因而导出了一些闹地位闹待遇争级别争工资的歪风。虽然这种歪风并不大，却也不能等闲视之，因为这些东西，显然正是某种程度的资产阶级思想的反映。
    目前我们在市场供应、学校容量及城市公用设施等各个方面出现的紧张现象，主要是由于人民的经济收入普遍不断增加，因而提高生活水平的要求随之大大增长起来了，这是很自然的。社会主义经济法则，就是不断满足人民提高生活水平不断增长的要求。人民将永远不断感到从不足到满足，又从满足感到不足而循环不已，这是发展的必然规律。可是我们却有不少人存在着要在一个早上就完全实现高度社会主义生活的思想，因而就觉得这也不够那也不够了，连回顾一下解放前的那种生活情况而对比一下也不愿意，这种只凭个人幻想不顾客观实际的急躁情绪，与增产节约这一社会主义重要原则是不相容的。我们在现阶段，主要是必须尽一切可能集中人力物力于不断扩大再生产，并且在建成了社会主义之后，也仍然必须在不断适度提高生活水平的原则下不断扩大再生产。因此，增产节约这个原则必须是长期地贯彻的，而在提高生活上那种脱离实际、不顾长远利益和有计划有重点全面平衡发展的某些片面过分要求是不对的，实质上这正是还较普遍地存在着的小资产阶级思想的反映。
    总的说来，现在我们在意识形态上可以说已经是社会主义思想占了统治地位，但是不能否认，小资产阶级和资产阶级思想，还是一定地不同程度地存在着并作用着的，这就不能不有更广泛和更深刻的意识形态上的阶级斗争，并且还应该说即连共产党员也都一定程度地不能不是包括在内的。这反映在人民内部许多方面的矛盾现象上，也更普遍更显著地反映在节约和浪费的这一矛盾现象上。不过由于我们完全建立了社会主义的牢固的物质基础，社会主义思想也已经是我们意识形态上的主导面，因此这种内部矛盾就已经不是什么对抗性的，而只是正在不断转化中的一定过程现象，必然地只有愈来愈迅速地将要实现一个完全的质变，这是完全可以理解的。但是，我们毕竟不能否认，并且无论谁都应该特别正视和警惕着自己在这个过程中的斗争，这是相当长期的也是最后的一场艰巨斗争。
    一般的说，阶级斗争不能不是很激烈并且也是残酷的。但是，任何矛盾在一定条件下都可以转化，对抗性矛盾可以转化为非对抗性矛盾，阶级斗争也就可以表现为各种不同的斗争形式，也可以是通过和平改造的形式而逐步达到完全的转化和质变，特别在意识形态上的阶级斗争更是这样。因此，阶级斗争又并不是一件什么可怕的事，只要人们有了自觉并不断提高自觉，阶级斗争中的矛盾转化，也就将必然地有规律的发展。我国的小资产阶级和资产阶级之所以都能够并且已经基本上自己掌握了自己的命运，就是这个道理。事实证明，这是非常自然的。关于民主自由的范畴也是一样，只要人们有了自觉并不断提高自觉，自然就能享有自己应有的无任何限制的真正民主自由。人们其实总还是自己束缚于自己的某些局限中，也终于只有自己才能真正解放自己。社会主义就是在于人们都将自己解放自己，也从而解放全人类，并没有其他什么更深奥的道理。我自己是曾经从反动统治阶级中分化出来的，现在我却已经觉得自己真正解放了，因为我深切感到我完全自由地享有着我应该享有的民主权利和个人自由。由于我的亲身体验，我深刻理解现在存在于我们人民自己内部的矛盾只不过是些什么问题，而这种内部矛盾又是不会存在多久的，以今天比起昨天来，就已经不是更大了些而是更小得多了。并且我还认为有理由相信，即以存在于台湾问题上的敌我矛盾而说，也不是绝对不能转化的，只要台湾的军政当局们有了民族自觉，台湾就也将可能实现和平解放，许多外部条件及存在于台湾当局他们本身的某些内部因素，也正是都在不断增大这个可能性而终将成为现实。
    以上，我的这点意见，请批评指正。（附图片）
