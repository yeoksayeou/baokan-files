Xinhua News Agency reporter Jin Yuanqing reports: On the grounds of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, the expansion project of a modern steel casting workshop has begun with the construction of underground flues.

　　This factory building, as high as a six-story building and more than half a li long, is equipped with automatic gas and sand conveying systems, as well as good cooling, ventilation, lighting, and sand removal equipment. It has three layers of overhead cranes with a lifting capacity of up to 100 tons.

　　This huge workshop was originally renovated and expanded using old factory buildings and old equipment. People cleverly connected the original building with a new structure twice its size, and added new equipment with the original open-hearth furnace as the main body.

　　The steel casting workshop is the final project of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant's four-year renovation project; after the entire renovation and expansion project is completed by the end of November this year, it will produce various large-scale machines for the country, and will increase the plant's heavy machinery production capacity by 3.3 times.

　　沈阳重型机器厂扩建铸钢车间
    据新华社记者金原青报道：在沈阳重型机器厂的腹地上，一座现代化铸钢车间的扩建工程已开始了地下烟道施工。
    这座厂房，有六层大厦那样高，有半里多长，内部设有煤气和砂子的自动输送系统，并且装有良好的降温、通风、照明、除沙设备。它有三层桥式吊车，起重能力可达一百吨。
    这个巨大的车间，原来是利用旧厂房、旧设备来改建、扩建的。人们巧妙地把原有建筑物同比它大两倍的新结构连结起来，并且以原有的平炉为主体增设新设备。
    铸钢车间是沈阳重型机器厂四年改建工程的末期工程；整个改建、扩建工程在今年11月末完成以后，将为国家生产出各种大型号的机器，并且将使这个厂的重型机器生产能力提高三点三倍。
