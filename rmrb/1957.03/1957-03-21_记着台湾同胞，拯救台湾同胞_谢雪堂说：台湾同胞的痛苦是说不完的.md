Remembering Taiwan Compatriots, Rescuing Taiwan Compatriots
　　Xie Xuetang Says: The Suffering of Taiwan Compatriots is Endless
　　We are here discussing major domestic and international events, discussing the country's industrialization and the people's livelihood. Please allow me to talk about the situation in Taiwan. Compared with our compatriots on the mainland, the Taiwan compatriots are truly living in the depths of despair. We are free citizens of great China, while Taiwan compatriots are still living the life of slaves of a conquered nation. In Taiwan, patriotism is not allowed, there is no freedom, no socialism. There are only American weapons, American goods, and the Voice of America, only hunger and disease, chains and prisons.
　　The so-called "military aid" from the United States to Taiwan, from 1951 to 1956, totaled 1.9 billion US dollars. By the end of 1956, there were more than 3,000 US military personnel in the military assistance advisory group. In name, they manage "US aid," but in fact, they control the military institutions of the Chiang Kai-shek group. From the puppet Ministry of National Defense down to the company-level units, there are US military personnel. The transfer of Chiang's military officers, the construction of bunkers, the take-off and landing of airplanes, and the entry and exit of ships all require the approval of US military personnel. They also interfere in the daily work and life of Chiang's army everywhere. Therefore, a very unusual anti-American sentiment has become increasingly apparent among Chiang's personnel.
　　The United States can arbitrarily set up various military bases in Taiwan, and recently it wants to set up missile bases. US military personnel in Taiwan can arbitrarily occupy civilian houses, and even the houses of puppet government agencies are not spared. For example, last November, the Taipei puppet provincial government and the sugar company building were forced to relocate. US military personnel in Taiwan can arbitrarily set up so-called "US military areas, no passage" restricted areas. US military personnel cause trouble, and American cars hit people, and they are not subject to legal judgment. In the first half of last year alone, 1,362 Taiwan residents were injured by American cars, and 156 were killed. As for insulting women, beating residents, and drunken brawls, that is commonplace.
　　The so-called "economic aid" from the United States to Taiwan is the large-scale dumping of surplus materials. From 1951 to 1956, it "aided" about 600 million US dollars. Through the relationship of the "Taiwan Branch of the United States International Cooperation Administration," institutions such as the so-called "Economic Stabilization Committee" and "US Aid Utilization Committee" were established within the puppet Executive Yuan to control Taiwan's economy and plunder Taiwan's resources. The economic activities and financial planning of the puppet government are, of course, also under control. In addition, there is about 100 million US dollars of American private capital invested in Taiwan by taking advantage of special preferential conditions. At present, Taiwan's major industrial and mining enterprises, such as aluminum industry, hydropower plants, sugar factories, petroleum, timber, shipbuilding, steel, transportation, and even agriculture and fishery, have been invaded or monopolized by American capital.
　　The Chiang Kai-shek group cannot make ends meet just by relying on "US aid," so it desperately increases taxes and issues banknotes indiscriminately. According to statistics, from 1949 to the end of 1956, donations and taxes increased 56 times, the amount of puppet Taiwan currency issued increased 35 times, and prices jumped more than eight times. Taiwan's national industry and commerce have closed down one after another. Those that can barely maintain are also heavily in debt, owing taxes and wages. According to recent reports, there is one poor person in need of immediate relief for every nine people, and in some places, such as Taichung County, there is one for every four people. In Taipei County, which used to be known as prosperous, there is one beggar for every forty-one people. In the past, Taiwan was famous for its rice granaries, and there were grain exports every year. Now there are many hungry people and many people starving to death. Driven by life, I don’t know how many people are selling blood, prostituting, going crazy, or committing suicide, and many people are stealing.
　　Fellow members, the suffering of Taiwan compatriots is endless. I have briefly mentioned these, the purpose is: let us remember that the American robbers are still in our homes, let us recall Chiang Kai-shek's criminal rule, let us step up the construction of the motherland, so that Taiwan compatriots can be rescued as soon as possible. I am a Taiwanese, and I cannot but be particularly concerned about the liberation of Taiwan. I believe that the imperialists' conspiracy to create "two Chinas" will surely fail, and I believe that the possibility of peaceful liberation of Taiwan is getting greater and greater.
　　The United States has launched a movement to overthrow the Taiwan authorities. Please take a look at the end of Eden's departure to New Zealand, and take a look at the means by which the United States abandoned its allies, Britain and France, Taiwan KMT military and political personnel. The United States’ "military assistance" and "economic assistance" to Taiwan are not because they have any good feelings for you, but for the excessive profits of Wall Street bosses. Whoever cannot meet its requirements will be abandoned; whoever does not listen to it will be in trouble; whoever does not listen to its dictates will be kicked away. I hope that the KMT military and political personnel in Taiwan can discover their conscience, stand on the banner of patriotism, and return Taiwan to the motherland. Only in this way can they be forgiven by the Chinese people, including the Taiwanese people.
　　Finally, I wish the conference a complete success. (Attached picture)

### 记着台湾同胞，拯救台湾同胞　谢雪堂说：台湾同胞的痛苦是说不完的

　　记着台湾同胞，拯救台湾同胞
　　谢雪堂说：台湾同胞的痛苦是说不完的
    我们在这里讨论国内外大事，讨论了国家工业化和人民的生活问题。请允许我谈一谈台湾的情况。和大陆的同胞比较，台湾同胞真是在九天之下。我们是伟大中国的自由公民，而台湾同胞还在过着亡国奴生活。在台湾，不许爱国，没有自由，没有社会主义。那里只有美国武器，美国商品，和美国之音，只有饥饿和疾病，铁链和监狱。
    美国对台湾的所谓“军事援助”，从1951年至1956年共计“援助”了十九亿美元，军事援助顾问团的美军人员，到1956年底为止已有三千多人。他们名义上是管理“美援”，事实上是控制着蒋介石集团的军事机构。上自伪国防部下至营级连级单位，都有美军人员。蒋军军官的调动，碉堡的修筑，飞机的起落，舰艇的出入，都要美军人员的批准。蒋军日常工作和生活，他们也是处处干涉。因此在蒋方人员中已经越来越显出一种很不平常的反美情绪。
    美国在台湾可以任意设立各种军事基地，最近又要设立导弹基地。美军人员在台湾可以任意占用民房，连伪政府机关的房屋也不能幸免。如去年11月台北伪省政府和糖业公司大厦就被迫迁让了。美军人员在台湾可以任意设立所谓“美军重地，禁止通行”的禁区。美军人员闹事，美国汽车撞人，都不受法律裁判。仅去年上半年，台湾居民就被美国汽车撞伤了一千三百六十二人，撞死了一百五十六人。至于侮辱妇女，殴打居民，酗酒闹事，那就是司空见惯的事了。
    美国对台湾的所谓“经济援助”就是大量的倾销剩余物资。自1951年至1956年约“援助”了六亿美元。通过“美国国际合作总署台湾分署”的关系在伪行政院内设立所谓“经济安定委员会”“美援运用委员会”等机构来控制台湾的经济和掠夺台湾的资源。伪政府的经济活动和财政编制，当然也在被控制之列。此外还有利用特殊优越条件在台湾投资的美国私人资本约有一亿美元。现在台湾主要的工矿企业如铝业，水电厂，制糖厂，石油，木材，造船，钢铁，交通事业以至于农业，渔业，都被美国资本所侵入或垄断着。
    蒋介石集团光靠“美援”不够开销，就拚命加重税收，滥发钞票。据统计自1949年到1956年底为止，捐税增加到五十六倍，伪台币发行额增加到三十五倍，物价跳到八倍以上。台湾的民族工商业纷纷倒闭，能够勉强维持的也是负债累累，欠税欠薪。据最近报道，急待救济的贫民，每九个人就有一个，有的地方如台中县每四个人就有一个。素称富裕的台北县，每四十一人中就有一个乞丐。过去台湾以米仓著名，每年都有粮食出口，现在有许多饥民，很多饿死的人。为生活所迫不知多少人在卖血、卖淫、发疯或自杀，还有许多人做了盗窃。
    各位委员，台湾同胞的痛苦，是说不完的。我简单提了这些，目的在：让我们记住美国强盗还在我们家里，让我们回忆一下蒋介石的罪恶统治，让我们加紧建设祖国，使台湾同胞早得拯救。我是一个台湾人，对于解放台湾不能不特别关心。我相信帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋必将失败，相信和平解放台湾的可能性已经越来越大。
    美国已经发动一个推翻台湾当局的运动。请台湾国民党军政人员看看艾登出走新西兰的末路，看看美国抛弃它的盟国，英国法国的手段。美国对台湾进行“军事援助”和“经济援助”，并不是对你们有什么好感，而是为了华尔街老板的超额利润，谁不能满足它的要求，谁就要被它抛弃；谁不听它的话，谁就祸及其身；谁不听它支配，谁就被一脚踢开。我希望台湾国民党军政人员能够发现良知，站到爱国主义的旗帜下来，把台湾归还祖国。只有这样，他们才能得到中国人民包括台湾人民的原谅。
    最后祝大会胜利成功。（附图片）
