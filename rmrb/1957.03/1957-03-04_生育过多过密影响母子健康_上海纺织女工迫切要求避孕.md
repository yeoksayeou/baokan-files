Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd. Correspondent Gao Jie reports: The situation in Shanghai where many textile workers are experiencing health problems for themselves and their children due to excessive and dense childbearing has aroused deep concern from the health departments and relevant parties. All factories have universally begun to pay attention to conducting contraception propaganda among female workers.

Many textile factories use forms such as broadcasting, blackboards, pictures, slideshows, and exhibitions to disseminate information about contraception to female workers. Almost all factory clinics, health rooms, and health stations have set up designated personnel to provide guidance on contraception. Some female workers are shy and unwilling to go to contraception guidance centers, so the women's health workers in the workshop health rooms go in-depth to provide individual guidance.

It has been noted that many female workers, lacking understanding of scientific contraception methods, are recklessly using unreliable "folk remedies" for contraception or resorting to abortion, causing danger. Not long ago, Guomian No. 13 Factory discovered more than a dozen female workers had taken poisonous calomel, resulting in abdominal pain and diarrhea, which was fortunately stopped in time. Some female workers also attempt to induce abortions by recklessly taking quinine, "sha" medicine, drinking liquor, or lifting heavy objects after becoming pregnant.

According to statistics, among the more than 180,000 textile workers in Shanghai, on average, every four female workers give birth to one child per year. The health department conducted a survey of 609 pregnant female workers in Guomian No. 19 Factory and found that 17% of the female workers had two pregnancies in one year; 53% of the female workers had two pregnancies in two years; and 22% of the female workers had two pregnancies in three years. Guomian No. 13 Factory also surveyed last year and found that among the 756 female workers aged 26 to 35 in the entire factory, more than half had given birth to five or more children. In Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Textile Factory, which has 7,000 employees, the children born to female workers in the seven years since liberation have exceeded the total number of employees in the factory, with an average of 1,000 children born each year.

According to the understanding of medical personnel in some textile factories, although all factories have implemented female worker protection systems and universally have canteens and rest rooms for pregnant women, many female workers are affected in their work, health, and studies due to frequent pregnancies and childcare. Many female workers suffer from anemia, neurasthenia, and pregnancy-related hypertension and varicose veins.

At present, although the number of nurseries in Shanghai textile factories has increased from 33 at the beginning of liberation to more than 200, and some workers' concentrated residential areas have also set up nursery stations, the scale of the nurseries can still only accommodate about half of the children. Many female workers have to leave their children unattended at home or send them to the countryside for foster care after going to work. One of the children of Xu Afeng, a female worker at Guomian No. 9 Factory, who was fostered elsewhere, broke a leg bone and is still unable to walk at the age of one year and eight months. It is said that this is not an isolated case.

Due to the above reasons, female workers are urgently requesting contraception. However, how to help female workers to effectively practice contraception is still an issue that deserves widespread attention from society. At present, there are three obstacles to conducting scientific contraception education among female workers: many female workers still regard marriage and childbirth as "mysterious" private matters and are unwilling to seek guidance, but this phenomenon has changed after publicity and education. Secondly, the biggest obstacle is that contraception education is still only conducted among female workers and has not been carried out in society, among the vast number of male workers, and among residents; many female workers are unable to practice contraception because they cannot obtain the consent and cooperation of their husbands. Many men are unwilling to understand their wives and even suspect them of infidelity. Guomian No. 9 Factory once discovered an incident where a female worker was scolded by her husband for requesting contraception. Finally, many female workers feel that contraception tools are too expensive and hope for simple contraception methods. This also needs to be studied and considered by relevant parties.

### 生育过多过密影响母子健康  上海纺织女工迫切要求避孕

    生育过多过密影响母子健康
    上海纺织女工迫切要求避孕
    新华社上海2日电  新华社记者高洁报道：上海许多纺织女工因生育过多过密影响身体和孩子健康的情况，引起卫生部门和有关方面的深切关怀，各厂都已普遍注意向女工进行避孕宣传。
    不少纺织厂用广播、黑板报、图片、幻灯片、展览会等形式，向女工宣传避孕。各厂的医务所、卫生室、保健站，几乎全部设专人指导避孕。有的女工碍面子，不愿去避孕指导所，车间卫生室妇女保健员就深入进行个别指导。
    人们注意到，有不少女工因不懂科学的避孕方法，乱用不可靠的“单方”避孕或堕胎，引起了危险。不久以前，国棉十三厂曾发现有十多个女工吃了有毒的轻粉而发生腹痛和腹泻，幸亏及早被制止了。还有一些女工怀孕后乱吃奎宁、痧药水、喝烧酒、搬重物，企图造成人工流产。
    据统计，全上海十八万多纺织女工中，平均一年中每四个女工就要生一个孩子。卫生部门曾在国棉十九厂调查了六百零九个怀孕的女工，发现有17％的女工在一年中连生两胎；有53％的女工在两年之中妊娠两次；有22％的女工在三年之内妊娠两次。国棉十三厂去年也曾调查出全厂七百五十六个二十六岁到三十五岁的女工中，半数以上的人生过五胎以上。有七千职工的申新第九棉纺织厂的女工们解放后七年来生育的孩子已经超过了全厂职工的总人数，平均每年要生一千个孩子。
    据一些纺织厂医务人员的了解：虽然各厂都推行了女工保护制度，工厂普遍设有孕妇食堂和孕妇休息室；但是很多女工由于经常妊娠和照顾孩子，因而工作、身体、学习都受到影响。女工中患贫血、神经衰弱和妊娠期中高血压、静脉曲张等病症的很多。
    目前上海纺织厂的托儿所，虽然已经由解放初的三十三所增加到二百多所，一些工人集中居住的地区也设立了托儿站，但是，目前托儿所的规模，仍然只能收容大约半数的孩子。许多女工上工以后不得不把孩子放在缺人照料的家中或送往乡下寄养。国棉九厂女工许阿凤的一个寄养在别处的孩子被跌坏了腿骨，现在一岁零八个月还不会走路。据说这并不是个别的例子。
    由于以上这些原因，女工们迫切要求避孕。但是，如何帮助女工有效的避孕，仍然是值得引起社会上普遍注意的问题。目前在女工中进行科学的避孕教育，遇到三个障碍：有不少女工仍然把结婚、生孩子当做“神秘”的私事，不肯求人指导，这种现象，经宣传教育以后，已经有了转变。其次，最大的障碍是避孕教育至今只在女工中间进行，没有在社会上、在广大男工中和居民中展开；很多女工因为得不到丈夫的同意和配合，无法避孕。不少男方不肯体谅妻子，甚至怀疑妻子行为不轨。国棉九厂就曾发现有一个女工因要求避孕而被丈夫痛骂的事。最后，还有不少女工感觉避孕工具价格太贵，并且希望有简便的避孕方法。这也是需要有关方面研究、考虑的。
