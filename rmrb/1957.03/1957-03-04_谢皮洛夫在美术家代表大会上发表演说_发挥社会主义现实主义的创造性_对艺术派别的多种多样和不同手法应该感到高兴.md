Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd, Moscow dispatch: According to TASS, Soviet Communist Party Central Committee Secretary Shepilov delivered a long speech at the All-Union Congress of Artists on the 2nd.

Shepilov said that the task of fine arts lies in aesthetically educating the millions of working people, enriching their sensory knowledge, and becoming a powerful tool for enhancing their spiritual and cultural development. We do not need the affectedness of formalism, nor the deformed products of "abstractionists"; what we need is art filled with advanced thought and the enthusiasm of the human heart, reflecting the profound truths of life and lofty humanitarianism.

When discussing the issue of socialist realism, Shepilov said that the concept of socialist realism itself thoroughly and clearly reflects the essence and characteristics of Soviet art as a new stage and step in the development of human art. Socialist realism reflects the organic connection of our art with the excellent realistic traditions of the past. However, the realism of Soviet art is not an imitation or replication of the realism of the past. This realism is a creative method enriched by the most advanced and only scientific worldview of modern times, Marxism-Leninism, which is constantly growing and developing on the basis of the great revolution that opened a new era in human social history.

The Party has determined the basic characteristics of socialist realism as the creative method of Soviet art, and emphasized that it is intolerable to interpret this method as one that would homogenize the artistic individuality of the masters. We should not be afraid of the variety of artistic schools and the uniqueness of each artist's techniques, but should be glad.

Shepilov said: A suggestion has been put forward in newspapers and at artists' meetings: Do not regard socialist realism as a creative method, but as the artist's worldview. The debate here is not a matter of terminology, but concerns something very important. Regarding socialist realism as a worldview rather than a creative method will only confuse important concepts and open the door to subjectivism. Needless to say, this issue needs to be further explored theoretically in a comprehensive way.

Shepilov then talked about the issue of realistic tradition and innovation. He said that the requirement for artists to create works that truthfully reflect the new socialist social system and the new people of the Soviet era inherently contains innovation, including the search for new ways of expressing the content of life. For us, innovation in art is not an end in itself. We cannot disregard the question: In what direction should we innovate? We say: Rely on the classical heritage, and innovate in art in the direction of striving for a deeper understanding of reality and social life, and in the direction of further perfecting art itself and its methods of depiction. This understanding of innovation will promote artists to move forward, giving them clear goals and a reliable principled basis.

Shepilov said that the old is not all bad, and the new is not all good. The revolutionary nature of life and art lies in: being good at looking at all phenomena and new and old art from the perspective of the people's interests.

For art workers, the main thing is to get closer to the life of the people and deeply understand the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of the Soviet people. The daily and heroic life and struggle of the Soviet people and the great socialist family of nations should be the real theme of our art.

We do not want to prescribe to artists what subjects they "must" use or what subjects they "should not" use. Vigorous social sensitivity and artistic interest in life and people will enable everyone to find their own subject matter. However, I just want to say one thing: the more meaningful the subject matter is, the closer it is to the thoughts and feelings of the people and cherished by the people; the more meaningful the subject matter is, the more the artist should receive assistance and attention from cultural institutions and artists' associations.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 3rd: The first All-Union Congress of Artists of the Soviet Union continued its meeting on the 1st. The Congress listened to supplementary reports from artists on Soviet painting, art criticism, propaganda posters, etc. At the evening meeting, Liu Kaiqu, a Chinese artist invited to participate in the conference, read a congratulatory letter to the conference on behalf of Chinese artists and gave a speech.

Honored Artist of the Russian Federation, Serebryany, in his report on Soviet painting, talked about the achievements made by painters from the Soviet Union's various republics over the past forty years on the road of socialist realism. He said that Soviet artists and artists unanimously believe that the principles of the people's character and the Party spirit of art are indestructible, and what they are arguing about is only what these principles refer to and how to better realize these principles in their creations. The leadership of the Party is a fundamental guiding principle, and all honest artists in the Soviet Union regard the leadership of the Party as the Party and the entire Soviet people's constant assistance and support for their creations.

Art scholar Dr. Alpatov then gave a supplementary report on "Art Studies and Criticism." In his report, he emphasized that it is necessary to more boldly intervene in today's issues and oppose vulgar understandings of modern life.

Honored Artist of the Russian Federation, Ivanov, pointed out in his supplementary report on political propaganda posters that Soviet propaganda posters reflect all the major phenomena in the lives of the Soviet people during the forty years of Soviet power. In the past six years alone, more than 32,000 kinds of propaganda posters have been published nationwide, totaling 665 million copies.

Chinese artist Liu Kaiqu said in his speech that Chinese artists believe that socialist realism is a new direction in the development of human art and is the most progressive creative method, and Soviet art creations, with their unique posture, embody this creative method. Soviet art creations, along with the corresponding art theory that has developed, have been profoundly influencing the work of Chinese artists. He said that there are problems and shortcomings in the advancing Chinese art work, and in order to overcome the shortcomings, it is necessary to further delve into life, improve the cultivation of Marxism, and improve artistic skills. Every nation has its own artistic traditions and national characteristics, and progressive human culture needs mutual influence and integration, because this is conducive to our common great cause.

Soviet famous writer Sholokhov was unable to attend the conference due to some reason, and wrote a warm congratulatory letter to the conference.

The conference also received a congratulatory letter from the Hungarian sculpture master Strobl.

    谢皮洛夫在美术家代表大会上发表演说
    发挥社会主义现实主义的创造性
    对艺术派别的多种多样和不同手法应该感到高兴
    新华社3日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党中央委员会书记谢皮洛夫2日在全苏美术家代表大会上发表了长篇演说。
    谢皮洛夫说，美术的任务在于从美学方面来教育千百万劳动人民群众，丰富他们的感性知识，和成为增进精神和发展文化的强大工具。我们不需要形式主义的矫柔造作，不需要“抽象论者”的畸形产品；我们需要的是充满先进思想和有人类心灵的热情的那种反映深刻的生活真理和崇高的人道精神的艺术。
    在谈到社会主义现实主义问题的时候，谢皮洛夫说，社会主义现实主义这个概念本身就透彻而明确地反映出作为人类艺术发展的新阶段和新步骤的苏维埃艺术的本质和特征。社会主义现实主义反映出我们的艺术同过去优秀的现实主义传统的有机联系。但是，苏维埃艺术的现实主义并不是过去的现实主义的因袭和翻板。这种现实主义是为现代最先进的和唯一科学的世界观马克思列宁主义所充实的创作方法，这种创作方法在开辟了人类社会历史新纪元的伟大革命的基础上得到不断的成长和发展。
    党确定了作为苏维埃艺术创作方法的社会主义现实主义的基本特征，并且着重指出，把这个方法解释为会使得艺术大师的艺术个性划一的方法，这是令人不能容忍的。我们对艺术派别的多种多样、各个美术家的手法的互不雷同不必害怕，而应当感到高兴。
    谢皮洛夫说：在报纸上和在美术家会议上提出了这样一个建议：不要把社会主义现实主义看作是创作的方法，而看作艺术家的世界观。这里的争论不是一个名词的问题，而是关系到非常重要的东西。把社会主义现实主义当做世界观、而不当作创作方法的这种见解，只会使得重要的概念混淆起来，并且为主观主义打开道路。不言而喻，对这个问题是要进一步作理论上的全面探讨的。
    谢皮洛夫接着谈到了现实主义传统和革新的问题。他说，要求艺术家创造真实地反映社会主义的新社会制度和苏维埃时代的新人的作品，这一要求本身就包含着革新，包含着对反映生活内容的新的表现方法的探求。对我们来说，艺术中的革新，本身并不是目的。我们不能撇开这样的问题：朝什么方向革新？我们说：依靠古典遗产，在艺术上朝着力求能够更深刻地认识现实和社会生活的方向革新，朝着进一步完善艺术本身和它的描写方法的方向革新。这样理解革新就会促使艺术家前进，使他们有明确的目标，有可靠的原则根据。
    谢皮洛夫说，旧的东西并不都是坏的，新的东西也并不都是好的。生活和艺术中的革命性在于：善于从人民利益的角度来看待一切现象和新旧艺术。
    对艺术工作者来说，主要的是更加接近人民的生活，深入了解苏维埃人的思想、感情和体验。苏维埃人和伟大的社会主义国家大家庭的日常的和充满英雄气概的生活和斗争应当是我们艺术的真正主题。
    我们不想给美术家规定“必须”用什么样的题材或是“不要”用什么样的题材。生气蓬勃的社会敏感性和对生活、对人的艺术兴趣使每一个人都能找到自己的题材。但是，我只想说一点：越是有意义的题材，就越是同人民的思想和感情接近和为人民所珍视；越是有意义的题材，艺术家就越是应当得到文化机构和美术家协会方面的协助和关注。
    新华社莫斯科3日电  苏联第一届全国美术家代表大会1日继续开会。大会听取了艺术家们关于苏联绘画、艺术学批评、宣传画等的补充报告。在晚间会议上，应邀参加会议的中国美术家刘开渠代表中国美术家向大会宣读了贺信并且讲了话。
    俄罗斯联邦功勋艺术家谢列勃里扬尼在关于苏联绘画的报告中，谈到了苏联各加盟共和国画家四十年来在社会主义现实主义道路上所获得的成就。他说，苏联美术家和艺术家一致认为，艺术的人民性和党性的原则是颠扑不破的，他们所争论的只是这些原则所指的是什么和如何更好地在创作中实现这些原则。党的领导是根本的指导原则，苏联全体正直的美术家都把党的领导认为是党和苏联全体人民对他们的创作的经常援助和支持。
    艺术学博士阿尔帕托夫随后作了“论艺术学和批评”的补充报告。他在报告中着重指出，必须更勇敢地干预今天的问题，反对对于现代生活的庸俗的理解。
    俄罗斯联邦功勋艺术家伊凡诺夫在他的关于政治宣传画的补充报告中指出，苏联宣传画反映了苏联人民在苏维埃政权的四十年间生活中的一切重大现象。仅在最近六年，全国就出版了各种宣传画三万二千多种，总数达六亿六千五百万份。
    中国美术家刘开渠在讲话中说，中国美术家认为，社会主义现实主义是人类艺术发展的新方向，是一种最进步的创作方法，而苏联的美术创作，以其独特的姿态，体现着这一创作方法。苏联的美术创作同相应的发展起来的艺术理论，一直在深刻地影响着中国美术家的工作。他说，前进中的中国美术工作存在着问题和缺点，为了克服缺点必须进一步深入生活，提高马克思主义的修养，提高艺术技巧。每个民族有它自己的艺术传统和民族特点，进步的人类文化需要相互的影响和溶合，因为这有利于我们的共同的伟大事业。
    苏联名作家萧洛霍夫因故不能参加大会，给大会写了一封热烈的贺信。
    大会还收到了匈牙利雕刻巨匠斯特罗勃尔的一封贺信。
