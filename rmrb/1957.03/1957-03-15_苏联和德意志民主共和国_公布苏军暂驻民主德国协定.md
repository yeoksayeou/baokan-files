Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 14th: The agreement concerning issues related to the temporary stationing of Soviet troops in the German Democratic Republic, signed in Berlin on March 12th by the government delegations of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, has been published.

The agreement firstly points out that, given the German question has not yet been resolved peacefully, West Germany still has foreign troops stationed within its borders and bases of aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states have been established, and considering that the revival of German militarism in West Germany will pose a danger to peace, the two governments unanimously agree that the temporary stationing of Soviet troops in the German Democratic Republic is necessary and beneficial for guaranteeing the peace and security of the Soviet and German peoples, as well as the peoples of other European countries.

Article 1 of the agreement stipulates that the temporary stationing of Soviet troops on the territory of the German Democratic Republic shall not infringe upon its sovereignty; the Soviet troops shall not interfere in the internal affairs and socio-political life of the German Democratic Republic.

Article 2 of the agreement stipulates that changes in the number and location of Soviet troops temporarily stationed in the German Democratic Republic shall be subject to consultation between the governments of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic; if Soviet troops conduct exercises outside of their stationed area, the exercise area must be agreed upon with the competent authorities of the German Democratic Republic.

The agreement stipulates that Soviet troops, personnel, and their families stationed in the German Democratic Republic must respect and abide by the current laws of the German Democratic Republic. If Soviet military personnel or their family members commit punishable acts within the German Democratic Republic, they should generally be handled by the German Democratic Republic authorities in accordance with German law. If the relevant state organs of the German Democratic Republic request it, Soviet military personnel who violate German law shall be transferred back to their home country from the German Democratic Republic.

Article 18 of the agreement stipulates that when the safety of Soviet troops stationed in the German Democratic Republic is threatened, the General Headquarters of the Soviet forces in the German Democratic Republic may, after consultation with the government of the German Democratic Republic and taking into account the circumstances that have arisen and the measures taken by the German Democratic Republic authorities, take measures to eliminate such threats.

    苏联和德意志民主共和国
    公布苏军暂驻民主德国协定
    新华社柏林14日电  苏联和德意志民主共和国两国政府代表团3月12日在柏林签订的关于苏军暂驻德意志民主共和国境内的有关问题的协定已经公布。
    这个协定首先指出，鉴于德国问题还没有获得和平解决、西德还驻有外国军队和建立有侵略性的北大西洋集团成员国的基地并且考虑到德国军国主义在西德复活将给和平造成危险，两国政府一致认为，苏军根据国际条约和协定暂时驻在德意志民主共和国境内是必要的，并且对于保证苏德两国人民和其他欧洲国家人民的和平和安全是有好处的。
    协定第一条规定，苏军在德意志民主共和国领土上的暂时驻扎不得损害它的主权；苏军不得干涉德意志民主共和国的内政和社会政治生活。
    协定在第二条中规定，暂时驻在德意志民主共和国境内的苏军人数和驻地的变动，须经过苏联和德意志民主共和国两国政府磋商；苏军如在驻地以外进行演习，其演习地区须商得德意志民主共和国主管当局的同意。
    协定规定，驻在德意志民主共和国境内的苏联军队、人员及其家属必须尊重和遵守德意志民主共和国的现行法律。如果苏军人员或他们的家属在德意志民主共和国境内犯有应受惩罚的行为，通常应当由德意志民主共和国的机关按照德国法律处理。如果德意志民主共和国有关国家机关提出请求，违犯德国法律的苏军人员应从德意志民主共和国调回国内。
    协定在第十八条中规定，当驻在德意志民主共和国境内的苏军的安全受到威胁时，在德意志民主共和国的苏军总司令部可以在同德意志民主共和国政府磋商以后，并且在考虑到已发生的情况和德意志民主共和国当局所采取的措施的情况下，采取消除这种威胁的措施。
