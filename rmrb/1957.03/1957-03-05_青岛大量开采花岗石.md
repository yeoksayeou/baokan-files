Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 4th. The state-owned Qingdao Stone Material Factory is massively mining granite for industrial sectors such as acid production and dyeing. This granite can withstand strong acids, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and acetic acid.

The mother liquor tank of the Phenacetin workshop at the state-owned Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory previously used another metal instead of stainless steel because it was unavailable, but it only lasted for a little over a year. Since switching to this granite last year, it has performed very well and is estimated to last for decades.

This granite is mined from Dajinding Mountain in the suburbs of Qingdao. The stone is hard, has a low water absorption rate, and comes in two colors: red-white and gray-white. The color is uniform, bright, and beautiful. The Monument to the People's Heroes in Tiananmen Square in Beijing is made of this granite.

    青岛大量开采花岗石
    新华社青岛4日电  地方国营青岛料石厂正在大批开采可以供制酸、印染等工业部门用的花岗石。这种花岗石能耐强酸、盐酸、硫酸和醋酸。
    国营新华制药厂非那西汀车间的母液槽，过去因为买不到不锈钢改用另一种金属制造，但是只能使用一年多，去年改用这种花岗石以后至今很好，估计可以使用几十年。
    这种花岗石是在青岛市郊区的大金顶山开采的，石质坚硬，吸水率低，有红白和灰白两种颜色，色泽均匀，鲜艳美观。北京天安门广场的人民英雄纪念碑就是用这种花岗石制成的。
