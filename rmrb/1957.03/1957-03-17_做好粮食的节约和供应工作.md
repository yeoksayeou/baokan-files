    Do a Good Job in Saving and Supplying Grain
    Recently, many local newspapers published commentaries on the current work of saving grain and rectifying grain supply in urban and rural areas.
    Hebei Daily published an editorial on March 1st titled "Strive to Save 500 Million Jin of Grain to Support Production in Disaster Areas." The editorial said that Hebei Province suffered severe disasters last year, and the state has transferred more than 3.5 billion jin of grain from various places to support Hebei Province. However, many people, and even some staff members, do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of saving grain to support production in disaster areas. Therefore, some people do not pay attention to saving after being affected by the disaster; those who are not short of grain also clamor for it, and even sell the grain supplied by the state on the market at high prices. As a result, the state's grain sales have exceeded the plan month by month.
    The editorial called on the people in urban and rural areas to respond to the call of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee: save one or two liang of grain per person per day; appropriately reduce social grain consumption such as for staple food and pastry industries, and livestock feed for transportation; agricultural cooperatives should do a good job in adjusting surpluses and deficiencies; the state's grain market should be well managed, and illegal activities such as speculation and trafficking in grain should be strictly prohibited. The editorial analyzed various objective situations and believed that the above measures were entirely possible to implement. By taking these measures, the province will be able to save 500 million jin of grain from March to the end of June.
    Anhui Daily published an editorial on March 9th on doing a good job in the current work of unified grain purchase and sale in rural areas. The editorial used the specific figures of the state's unified purchase and sale of grain in the province in 1956 to criticize the erroneous claim by some people that "the state purchases too much and sells too little."
    The editorial said that there are indeed abnormal phenomena in grain supply work in some areas, mainly because it has not been properly arranged household by household, so that some households that should not be supplied are supplied, while households that are really short of grain cannot get supply; secondly, because the income of some wealthy peasants has decreased after joining the cooperative, or because they are unwilling to take out part of their surplus grain for adjustment, they cry out everywhere, creating a tense atmosphere.
    Where is the key to solving the current grain unified purchase and sale work in rural areas? The editorial said that it lies in finding out the situation and understanding how many people in the agricultural cooperative are short of grain and how much they are short. The main way to solve the shortage of grain is to organize the adjustment of surplus and deficiency households within the cooperative. Some farmers have overdrawn grain according to labor work points, and some households cannot eat that much grain according to the grain ration standard because they have more children, so it is entirely possible to carry out adjustment within the cooperative. In addition, some of the mobile grain and surplus seed grain left by the agricultural cooperative can also be taken out to adjust the needs of grain-deficient households. In addition, running the state grain market well and carrying out social surplus grain adjustment is also a feasible method.
    Shanghai Jiefang Daily, Lüda Daily, and Xi'an Daily published commentaries in early March on the work of rectifying and saving grain in cities. These newspapers' commentaries pointed out that the sales volume of grain in Shanghai, Lüda, and Xi'an has been on the rise recently.
    According to the inspection of grain rationing work in Changning, Xuhui, Hongkou, and Western Suburbs districts of Shanghai: about 30% of residents have exceeded their actual needs; many collective catering units have not seriously implemented the system of collecting grain coupons, and the surplus grain is not reported; the grain consumption of industrial and commercial industries has also exceeded the actual needs.
    These commentaries all pointed out that rectifying unified grain purchase and sale is a complex and meticulous task, so it is necessary to strengthen propaganda and education work and implement the mass line. The commentary of Lüda Daily pointed out that the work of rectifying grain sales should also be carried out in the spirit of seeking truth from facts, and it is necessary to achieve both saving and not affecting actual needs.

### 做好粮食的节约和供应工作

    做好粮食的节约和供应工作
    最近，许多地方报纸就当前城乡节约粮食和整顿粮食供应工作发表了评论。
    河北日报在3月1日以“为节约五亿斤粮食支持灾区生产而努力”为题发表了社论。社论说，河北省去年遭灾严重，国家从各地调来支持河北省的粮食已达三十五亿斤之多。但是不少群众甚至一部分工作人员对节约粮食支持灾区生产的意义认识不足，因此有些人受灾后不注意节约；本来不缺粮的也喊缺粮，甚至拿国家供应的粮食到市场上高价出卖。这样，就使得国家的粮食销售月月突破计划。
    社论要求城乡人民响应河北省委号召：每人每天节约一两粮食；对面食糕点业以及运输牲畜饲料等社会性用粮要适当加以压缩；农业社要作好余缺调剂；国家的粮食市场要管理好，严禁投机贩运粮食的非法活动。社论分析了各种客观情况，认为上述措施是完全可能实现的。采取了这些措施，全省从3月到6月底将能节约五亿斤粮食。
    安徽日报3月9日为做好当前农村粮食统销工作发表社论。社论用1956年国家在全省统购统销粮食的具体数字，批判了某些人认为“国家统购多、销售少”的错误说法。
    社论说，某些地区在粮食供应工作上，确实有不正常的现象，这主要是没有逐户地妥善安排，使得有些不该供应的户供应了，而真正缺粮户反得不到供应；其次是因为有些富裕农民入社以后收入减少，或者是因为他们有一部分余粮不愿拿出来进行调剂，于是到处叫喊，造成了紧张的空气。
    解决农村当前粮食统销工作的关键在那里呢？社论说，在于摸清情况，了解农业社究竟有多少人缺粮，缺多少。解决缺粮的主要办法是，组织社内余缺户调剂。有些农民按照劳动工分超支了粮食，有些户因为小孩较多，按口粮标准吃不了那么多的粮食，因此进行社内调剂是完全可能的。至于农业社留的机动粮、多余的种子粮也可以拿出一部分调剂缺粮户的需要。另外，办好国家粮食市场，开展社会余粮调剂，也是一个可行的办法。
    上海解放日报、旅大日报、西安日报在3月上旬先后为城市整顿和节约粮食工作发表了评论。这些报纸的评论指出，上海、旅大、西安粮食的销量，在最近以来有上升的趋势。
    据上海市长宁、徐汇、虹口、西郊四个区对粮食定量供应工作的检查：在居民中有30％左右的人超过了实际需要；许多集体伙食单位，没有认真执行收粮票制度，结余粮食也不上报；工商行业用粮也超过实际的需要。
    这些评论都指出：整顿粮食统销是复杂而细致的工作，因此必须加强宣传教育工作，贯彻群众路线。旅大日报的评论指出，整顿粮食销量的工作，也要本着实事求是的精神进行，要做到既节约又不影响实际的需要。
