Science and Technology Cannot Be Separated from the Leadership of the Party
Zhou Jianren's Speech

“Some time ago, there were individuals who believed that the Party was good at leading politics but not necessarily good at leading science and technology, so it should be managed by the science and technology community itself. However, ... science and technology are linked to politics. Only with progressive politics can science and technology serve the people and develop healthily."

In early February, I had some business in Wuhan and had the opportunity to see the Yangtze River Bridge under construction. The most important part of the bridge construction was the pier foundation. In the past, the compressed air caisson method was used, with workers going underwater in a box-like structure to operate. Working in a 3.8 atmospheric pressure chamber (i.e., the caisson) was very difficult for the workers, and injuries and deaths often occurred. Moreover, the Yangtze River is deep and wide, requiring the excavation of a large area of rock at the bottom of the river, making the project too large. In 1954, with the help of Soviet experts, the large pipe column drilling method was used, allowing construction to be carried out on the water surface. This technical method improvement is clearly inseparable from the Party's leadership. This construction method is cheaper, saving 6.2 million yuan compared to the caisson method, and takes less time, but most importantly, it avoids worker injuries and deaths. In the past, when building the Qiantang River Bridge using the caisson method, many people died. Saving money and time is good, and that was already known, but today's use of this new method clearly demonstrates the benefits of proletarian humanitarianism. Furthermore, since liberation, natural scientists have responded to the Party's call for increased production with great enthusiasm. For example, the Northwest Agricultural College researched the "Biyu Wheat" and "Locust Wheat" hybrid variety – Bima No. 1. This wheat has a high resistance to rust and frost, does not easily lodge, and is early-maturing and high-yielding (Bima No. 4 also has these characteristics). It has been promoted on more than 20 million mu of land in Shaanxi and other provinces, increasing the yield by more than 20% per mu.

Also, after liberation, the Zhejiang Agricultural College began experimenting with grafting moonflower seedlings onto sweet potato rootstocks. Because moonflowers have high photosynthetic activity, the nutrients in the underground tubers can accumulate more, naturally increasing the size of the tubers. When I went to Zhejiang the year before last, I saw huge sweet potatoes produced after grafting. At the Western Suburbs Agricultural Exhibition this time, the South China Agricultural Science Institute used sweet potatoes grafted with moonflower seedlings to produce large sweet potatoes weighing more than 100 jin per plant (see People's Daily, February 23), which is truly astonishing. In addition, scientists have made many achievements in response to the Party's call, which cannot be detailed here.

The above-mentioned progress in science and technology is all related to the Party's correct leadership. There is also the issue of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. Before liberation, traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine were mutually opposed. Many traditional Chinese medicines are indeed effective. From what I have personally seen, lychee seeds and fennel, which seem to have little effect, are extremely effective in treating infantile hernias. Over the decades, I have personally seen many people cured. There are many other examples that I cannot list exhaustively. All countries' pharmacopeias contain effective medicines produced in their own countries. It is not surprising that China also has special medicines. It's just that in old China, modern science was very backward, and of course, traditional Chinese medicine also lacked the foundation and basis of modern science. However, traditional Chinese medicine also has its unique insights into medical treatment. For example, it strongly opposes the "treating the head when the head aches, and treating the foot when the foot hurts" approach, believing that treatment should be targeted at a specific disease, but also comprehensively take into account the overall situation; and believes that cultivating the fundamental, that is, enhancing the body's functions so that it can resist disease, is an important principle of medical treatment. This principle is worth studying. I believe that through mutual learning between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, absorbing the strengths of both sides, and adding modern science to improve it, medicine will definitely take a step forward, which is certain. This progress is also inseparable from the Party's leadership.

Natural science (including medicine) is inherently produced and developed to meet the needs of the people. In ancient times, both nomadic and agricultural peoples needed to know the climate and seasons, and astronomy arose. Navigation also requires knowing astronomy. But astronomy must have mathematics to develop, and so people engaged in mathematical research. Similarly, agriculture needs to divert water into the fields to irrigate crops, and mechanics (dynamics) also developed. This is something everyone knows. But in the old society where the exploitation system prevailed, the rulers not only ruled the people, but also seized and occupied natural science, not using it to serve the people, but using it for the enjoyment of a few and engaging in aggression. For example, with the discovery of atomic energy, the Soviet Union is making every effort to promote its peaceful use, while American imperialism is striving to use it as a destructive tool of aggression. Of course, the U.S. also uses methods to promote natural science, but that is to serve the wealth of a few. It runs contrary to the safety and happiness of mankind.

Not only that, but in imperialist countries there are also examples of manufacturing false science and suppressing true science. During the era of Hitler's rule in Germany, the Nazi Party dismissed anthropologists and psychologists from teaching at universities; not because those scientists taught poorly, but because the scientific principles they taught conflicted with the racism promoted by the Nazi Party. Everyone knows that the United States has also had cases of interrogating teachers who taught Darwin's theory of evolution and fining them. Also, some countries have dismissed zoology professors for teaching evolution, involving social evolution, saying that social systems such as the monarchy should also be changed.

And I can also add that birth control is obviously a progressive measure. Conception is inherently a natural physiological function. Now, using scientific methods to make planned control is clearly an extension of controlling nature and is progress. And reducing some births can reduce the physiological burden on women, the mental burden on parents, and the economic burden, so that more strength can be used in material production and spiritual production, and these products can be produced better. It is extremely beneficial to society. However, an American nurse named Sanger was imprisoned for promoting birth control. This is not surprising. American businessmen certainly sell contraceptives and supplies to make money, but they are not allowed to advertise them publicly, because religion is inherently opposed to using science to control nature, and of course, it opposes artificial contraception. This is one point. Also, capitalists and imperialists need a reserve army of labor in order to exploit workers more and can recruit young people to be cannon fodder for aggressive wars. Of course, they oppose Sanger. Only in socialist countries can contraception be openly discussed and promoted, and the reason is very clear.

In short, when the proletarian political party leads the politics of the country, science restores its position of serving the people. As mentioned earlier, the Soviet Union has promoted the peaceful use of atomic energy, which is something everyone knows. Other situations, as Professor Boldyrev, a Soviet expert, said: "In socialist countries, science and scientific research work, as long as it conforms to the interests of the masses of the people, as long as it is to solve problems of improving the people's lives, it will be supported by the government and the Party, and will be supported by scientists and all the people. In socialist countries, the tasks of science are consistent with the tasks of the country and are consistent with the goals of the people at that stage."

After restoring science to its normal position, science itself will certainly develop greatly. The Soviet Union ranks first in the world in many fields of science, such as mathematics, nuclear physics, cosmic light and stratospheric research, higher nervous activity, and biology. These achievements cannot but be attributed to the leadership of the proletarian political party. Socialism is scientific, it needs real science, and science can certainly develop healthily.

The above-mentioned series of situations are sufficient to illustrate the necessity of science and technology being led by the proletarian political party. Some time ago, there were individuals who believed that the Party was good at leading politics but not necessarily good at leading science and technology, so it should be managed by the science and technology community itself. However, according to the facts mentioned above, science and technology are linked to politics. Only with progressive politics can science and technology serve the people and develop healthily.

Science and technology are also closely integrated with philosophy. If there is a lack of correct philosophical thought as a guide, natural science will also be difficult to develop to a high degree. The proletarian political party is the party of Marxism-Leninism, and its philosophy is the philosophy of dialectical materialism; this philosophical worldview is omnipotent, and the reason why it is omnipotent is because it is correct. This is the only correct philosophy, and it can lead natural science to advance infinitely.

Some people also believe that although Party members have all studied political theory, not all have studied natural science. Therefore, they raise the question of who should lead science and technology. In fact, the Party's leadership is a collective leadership. Even if not everyone is a natural scientist, there are many natural scientists within the organization. And broadly speaking, politics and philosophy are also sciences, and people who study these areas are scientists. If the Party's leadership of science and technology is seen as trivial technical issues such as how screws should be made, which must be decided by the Party, it would naturally be too cumbersome, but if it is said that science and technology do not need the Party's leadership, then the error and deviation of its assumption would be too great.

Chairman Liu said in the political report of the "Eighth National Congress": "There are also a very small number of comrades... who confuse the Party's leadership on the policy and direction of all aspects of the work of the country with purely technical issues. They believe that the Party is still an amateur in the technical business of these tasks, and therefore should not lead these tasks, and they can act arbitrarily. We criticized this erroneous view. The Party should and can play a leading role in all work in terms of ideology, politics, policy and direction. (Omitted below)" We should study these words carefully, which will be very helpful in increasing our understanding. (Attached picture)

### 科学技术不能离开党的领导  周建人的发言

    科学技术不能离开党的领导
    周建人的发言
    “前一些时候曾有个别的人认为党领导政治是擅长的，领导科学技术却未必擅长，所以应由科技界自己来管。可是，……科学技术与政治是连结在一起的，有进步的政治，科学技术才能为人民服务和健康地发展。”
      2月初上我有事到武汉去，有机会去看了正在建造中的长江大桥。大桥建造工程中最重要的是桥墩基础工程。过去都用压气沉箱法，工人在箱形物里下水去操作。工人在三点八大气压力的工作室里（即沉箱里）工作很困难，常有伤亡的事情发生。而且长江水深，江阔，须在水底开凿广大面积的岩石，工程亦太大。1954年得到苏联专家的帮助，用了大管柱钻孔法，可以在水面上施工。这种技术方法的改进显然与党的领导分不开的。此种施工方法，造价较便宜，比沉箱法可以节省六百二十万元，费时也少，但尤其重要的是可以免除工人的伤亡。过去造钱塘江大桥时用沉箱法就死了好些人。节省钱与时间有好处，是早已知道的，但今日的用这新法，分明是无产阶级人道主义的好处。还有，解放以后，自然科学家响应党的增产号召，精神奋发。例如西北农学院研究了碧玉麦和蚂蚱麦杂交品种——碧蚂1号。此麦有高度抵抗锈病及霜害的能力，不易伏倒，且早熟，丰产（碧蚂4号亦有此特性）。已在陕西等省推广了二千多万亩地，每亩可增产20％以上。
    又，浙江农学院在解放后，即试用月光花的苗嫁接在甘薯砧木上作试验。因月光花的光合作用大，下面块根的养料能积累得多，块根自然增大。我前年往浙江去时，曾看到嫁接后产生的巨大甘薯。此次西郊农业展览会中有华南农业科学研究所用甘薯接上月光花苗，一株能产生一百多斤的大甘薯（见2月23日人民日报），可以说骇人听闻。此外科学家响应党的号召作出的成绩很多，这里不及详细讲。
    以上所说科学技术的进步都与党的正确领导相关联。还有中西医的问题。在解放前，中医、西医是互相对立的。中药有效的确实很多，就我个人所看到的来说，看来好似没有什么作用的荔枝核与小茴香，治小孩疝气就极效。我在几十年中亲自看到治好了很多人。此外例子尚多，不胜列举。各国的药典里都载有本国产的有效药品。中国亦有特效药本来毫不为奇。只是在旧中国，近代科学很落后，当然中医里也缺乏近代科学的基础和根据。但中医的医疗方法上亦有它的特具的见解，例如它很反对“头痛医头，脚痛医脚”的疗法，认为治疗上固须针对某种疾病来医治，但又须综合地兼顾全面；并认为培养本元，即增强身体机能，使它能抵抗疾病是医疗的重要方针。这种道理很可供研究。我相信经过中西医互相学习，吸取两方面的长处，加上现代科学，予以提高，一定能给医学前进一步，是可以肯定的。这种进步也是与党的领导分不开的。
    自然科学（医学亦然）本是应人民的需要而产生和发展起来的。古代无论游牧民族或农业民族都很需要知道气候、季节，天文学就产生起来。航海也须知道天文。但天文学必须有数学才能发展，也就有人从事数学研究。又如农业上需要引水入田灌溉庄稼，机械学（力学）也发展起来了。这是大家知道的事情。但在通行剥削制度的旧社会里，统治者不特统治了人民，而且夺取与占有了自然科学，不把它用于为人民服务，而利用于少数人的享受和从事侵略。如原子能的发见，苏联在竭力提倡和平利用，而美帝国主义则在努力用作毁灭性的侵略工具。当然美帝也用方法推动自然科学，那是为少数人发财服务。与人类的安全幸福是相背驰的。
    不但如此，在帝国主义国家里还有制造假科学，压制真科学的事例。希特勒统治德国的时代，纳粹党曾经罢免人类学家们及心理学家们在大学里任课；并不是因为那些科学家教课不好，只是因为他们讲的科学上的道理与纳粹党提倡的种族主义相冲突。大家都知道美国还曾经有过审问讲达尔文进化论的教师和判处他罚金的事情。又有的国家因动物学教授讲进化论，涉及社会进化，说社会制度如君主制度也要改变而被免职。
    并且还可以附带一说，节制生育显然是一种进步的措施，受胎本是生理的自然作用，现在用科学方法作有计划的控制，分明是控制自然的一种推广，是进步的。并且减少一些生育，对于女人生理上的负担，父母精神上的负担，及经济上的负担都有所减轻，也就能够把更多的力量用在物质生产和精神生产上，把这些产物生产得更好。对于社会是极其有利的。然而美国的一护士叫山额尔夫人的，便因宣传节制生育曾被关在牢里。这种事情也并不奇怪。美国商人因为要赚钱固然也卖避孕药品及用品，不过不许公开宣传，因为宗教本是反对用科学控制自然的，当然反对讲人工避孕，这是一点。还有，资本家及其帝国主义者须要产业后备军以便更多地剥削工人，又可以招募青年去作侵略战争的炮灰。他们当然要反对山额尔夫人了。只有在社会主义体系的国家里才可以公开讨论与宣传避孕，道理是很明白的。
    总而言之，到无产阶级政党领导国家的政治时，科学才恢复了为人民服务的岗位，前面说到苏联曾提倡原子能和平利用，是大家知道的事情，其他的情况，正如苏联专家波尔德列夫教授所说：“在社会主义国家里，科学和科学研究工作，只要它是符合于人民群众的利益，只要它是为了解决改善人民生活上的问题，它就会受到政府和党的支持，就会受到科学家们和全体人民的支持。在社会主义国家里，科学的任务和国家的任务相一致的，是和该一阶段人民的目标相一致的。”
    把科学恢复到正常的位置上来以后，在科学本身当然会盛大发展起来，苏联在科学的许多领域中，如数学，核子物理学，宇宙光和同温层的研究，高级神经活动及生物学方面就都居世界上首要的地位。这等成绩不能不归功于无产阶级政党的领导是十分明白的事情。社会主义是科学的，它需要真正的科学，科学当然得以健康地发展。
    以上所说的一系列的情况都足以说明科学技术有必须由无产阶级政党领导的必要。前一些时候曾有个别的人认为党领导政治是擅长的，领导科学技术却未必擅长，所以应由科技界自己来管。可是依照前面所讲的事实看来，科学技术与政治是连结在一起的，有进步的政治，科学技术才能为人民服务和健康地发展。
    科学技术与哲学也是密切相结合的，如果缺乏正确的哲学思想作领导，自然科学也难于高度发展。无产阶级政党是马列主义的党，其哲学是辩证唯物主义的哲学；这一哲学的世界观是全能的，其所以全能，因为是正确的。这是唯一正确的哲学，它能领导着自然科学无限地前进。
    也有人以为党员虽都学过政治理论，但不是都学过自然科学，因此提出科学技术应由谁来领导的疑问。其实党的领导既是集体的领导，即使每一个人虽不都是自然科学家，但也有不少自然科学家在组织之内。并且广义地说，政治与哲学也都是科学，学习这方面的人都是科学家。如果把党对科学技术的领导看作像螺丝钉应如何做法这等琐细的技术问题，都须由党来决定，自然未免失之过于繁琐，但如说科学技术不须要党的领导，则其设想的错误和偏差未免太大。
    刘委员长在“八大”的政治报告上曾说过：“也有极少数同志……把党对于国家各方面工作的政策方针的领导问题同单纯技术方面的问题混淆起来，他们认为党对于这些工作的技术业务还是外行，因而就不应当领导这些工作，而他们则可以独断专行。我们批判了这种错误的观点。党应当而且可以在思想上、政治上、方针政策上对于一切工作起领导作用。（下略）”这些话，我们应仔细学习，对于增加我们的了解，是极有帮助的。（附图片）
