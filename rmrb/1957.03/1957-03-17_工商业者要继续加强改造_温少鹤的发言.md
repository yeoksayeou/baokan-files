At this meeting, I listened to Chairman Zhou Enlai's "Report on Visits to Eleven Asian and European Countries." This great achievement of working hard for the country and visiting distant lands filled me with admiration and deeply moved me. I also joined the other members in listening to Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," which gave us kind and great guidance. I am engaged in the work of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. Chairman Mao's instruction this time mentioned the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in socialist transformation. After the public-private partnership of the entire industry, industrialists and businessmen have generally made progress, but there are still a few people who have the idea of not wanting to transform or not needing to study. Chairman Mao criticized this. In December last year, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce convened a representative conference of members. On the eve of the meeting, Chairman Mao raised this issue at a forum for heads of industrial and commercial delegations from various provinces and cities, and instructed industrialists and businessmen to carry forward the spirit of patriotism, combine personal interests with national interests, work hard to study, strengthen transformation, and actively do a good job in production and management, and contribute their talents to the country's socialist construction. These instructions gave industrialists and businessmen great encouragement. I would like to talk about the relevant situation and personal experience regarding Chairman Mao's two instructions to industrialists and businessmen.

After the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce closed its session, the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce immediately held a meeting to convey the message under the guidance and support of the local Party and government. In addition to the spirit and resolutions of the meeting, the content of the message focused on Chairman Mao's instruction to carry forward the spirit of patriotism, and also conveyed the Party and government's policy of redemption for capitalist industry and commerce, with fixed interest rates unchanged for seven years (starting from 1956). Small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen and capitalist agents with little or no private shares can be classified as petty bourgeoisie. The main significance is to enable large, medium, and small enterprises to feel at ease, get what they need, and give full play to their enthusiasm. Due to the vast area of Sichuan, the communication to the cities and counties of each special zone was organized by representatives who attended and were present at the national conference and a group of members of the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, who went to various places to assist in the work, stipulating that the communication work of each city and county should be combined with the local situation, appropriately solve problems and reflect problems, and also inspect and supervise the work of the local Federation of Industry and Commerce. After the communication in various places was completed, the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce convened a forum for those who were responsible for the communication work to report on the situation, exchange opinions, and share experiences. This method avoids becoming a formality, communicating for the sake of communication, and plays a role in promoting how to implement the spirit of the communication. What I want to mention here in particular is that after Chairman Zhou Enlai visited eleven countries, he passed through Chongqing on his way back to China, received local Party and government staff, and after giving a communication report at the Chongqing Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce Member Representative Conference, he visited the meeting place, received all the representatives, and took a photo together. This was a very rare opportunity, which had an unparalleled driving force for giving play to the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen.

When communicating Chairman Mao's instruction on carrying forward the spirit of patriotism, at first it was thought to be a commonly mentioned phrase, familiar and unremarkable, but after repeated study, combined with practice, and repeated research, there was a deeper understanding. Carrying forward the spirit of patriotism is not an empty phrase. In the past, the slogan of loving the country and abiding by the law was put forward, and then the policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation was put forward. This time, Chairman Mao put forward patriotism, which has raised the requirements for the industrial and commercial circles. Vice Premier Chen Yun pointed out in his speech at the "Eighth National Congress" that "After the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has achieved a decisive victory, some measures taken by the national economic departments to restrict capitalist industry and commerce in the past few years have become unnecessary. These measures were necessary at the time and achieved results... If these measures continue to be taken at present, they will inevitably hinder the further development of the national economy." This is because the socialist transformation of industry and commerce has been basically completed after the public-private partnership of the entire industry, and the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in our country has been basically resolved. The main contradiction in our country is already the contradiction between the advanced socialist system and the backward social productive forces. Concentrating our efforts to solve this contradiction is the main task of the people of the whole country at present, and it is also the main task of our industrialists and businessmen. As a patriotic industrialist and businessman, in order to accomplish this task, we should continue to accept transformation, become a veritable laborer, and actively contribute our technical knowledge and management knowledge in the process of transformation, give full play to the superiority of public-private joint ventures, and vigorously develop productive forces, so as to promote China's socialist construction cause more, better, faster, and more economically. Our All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce should continue to play its unique role, based on Chairman Mao's instruction of patriotism, further do a good job in uniting, educating, and transforming industrialists and businessmen, assist the government in mobilizing all positive forces in the industrial and commercial circles, and serve the socialist cause.

Since the joint operation of the entire industry, the industrial and commercial circles have entered a new stage, and there are new tasks and problems. Can the patriotism mentioned by Chairman Mao solve all problems? My experience is that it is entirely possible, as long as we can combine personal interests with national interests at any time and any place, the new tasks and problems can be easily solved. Taking the relationship between the public and private sectors as an example, if we do not treat the public sector and the employees well, it will affect production and management, which is detrimental to the enterprise, and therefore detrimental to the country. Therefore, we must take the initiative to approach the public sector and employees, and improve the relationship, so that we can be worthy of the country and worthy of ourselves. In terms of the relationship between private individuals, there must be unity between large, medium, and small enterprises, and there must be unity within enterprises. We must also think that if the relationship between private individuals is not good, it will affect production and management, which is not conducive to the country, and everyone will naturally unite. Why do we participate in labor competitions and strive to become advanced producers and advanced workers? Why do we invest in the increase production and practice economy movement? It is precisely to give play to our enthusiasm, which is conducive to national production and construction. The national bourgeoisie of our country is generally patriotic. Since we still need to further and thoroughly complete socialist transformation in the future and enter socialist society with the people of the whole country, this requires us to unify our understanding and improve our understanding. We must recognize the consistency of socialism and patriotism, and we must also combine patriotism with internationalism. In general, if we can deeply understand the spirit of patriotism prompted by Chairman Mao and combine it with practical actions, we can do a good job, solve problems, become a panacea, and become a great driving force for eliminating all prejudices, doing a good job in all businesses, and completing all plans.

After the joint operation of the entire industry, the ideological understanding of industrialists and businessmen has made progress to varying degrees, giving play to their enthusiasm, and more and more people have joined the socialist competition. Taking Chongqing as an example, the number of private personnel participating in the competition in the second quarter of last year was 4,019, which increased to 5,758 in the third quarter. Among them, 503 people won the honorary title of advanced producer and advanced worker and received material rewards. In the fourth quarter, participation in the competition was even more widespread. The selection is now in full swing. The metal processing and reproduction printing industries have selected 64 advanced producers. Among the 58 advanced workers selected by the non-staple food business, 40 are private personnel. Some serve as engineers, actively promote advanced experience, and strive to improve technical equipment, improving the foot-operated printing machine and increasing production efficiency by about 30%. Some serve as workshop directors, improving the method of manufacturing pen holders and rubber plugs, increasing production capacity by five times compared with the past, and also reducing the scrap rate. Some are in charge of procurement work. At the time of tight pork supply and the implementation of quantitative vegetable oil last year, they promptly purchased more than 100 dan of flower oil in outer areas. When daylily was out of stock, they purchased more than 100 dan of daylily from the producing areas, which supplied the needs of the market. This is one aspect of the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen. However, there are still a few people who have the mentality of being guests and employees after the joint operation of the entire industry. They believe that the saving or waste of raw materials, the quality of products, have nothing to do with me, and the amount of business volume and the profit or loss of the enterprise have nothing to do with me. Anyway, I will be fine if I get these wages. Individual people even complain that the wages are low, and they are slack in their work, showing that they do as much work as they are paid, and there is an erroneous view of "paying for labor." In Chongqing, there is a white fungus shop, whose showcase glass has never been broken before, but a dozen pieces were broken soon after the joint operation, which indicates insufficient attention to the property of the people. For example, during the period from the Mid-Autumn Festival to the National Day last year, the supply of non-staple food in Chongqing was relatively tight. In the work of organizing fresh and live food, some private personnel did not put forward suggestions based on their past management experience to prevent losses. As a result, more than 16,000 chickens, ducks, and rabbits died, worth more than 8,000 yuan. Obviously, the interests of the country were neglected. This is just like the negative side of industrialists and businessmen pointed out by Chairman Mao in his speech this time. This requires industrialists and businessmen to work hard to transform, strengthen study, combine personal interests with national interests, establish a sense of ownership, and love joint ventures, at least as carefully as they used to be in protecting private property. In addition to preserving the old good experience, we should also improve the old bad style with the excellent system and method of socialist production and management, so that we can have a correct understanding, have improvement, be worthy of a true patriot, and be beneficial to the country and the people, and also be beneficial to ourselves.

Chairman Mao has shown deep concern for the study of industrialists and businessmen in his two instructions. Generally speaking, industrialists and businessmen in various places are required to study and make progress. The "Summary Report on the Work of Short-Term Training Classes for Industrialists and Businessmen" made by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong at this meeting fully proves this point. Each city under the jurisdiction of the province and many special zones in Sichuan Province have opened short-term training classes. Chongqing City has now opened the third session (named Industrial and Commercial Political School). I would like to introduce some information here. During the process of running the training class, international friends who visited successively included Joshi, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India, Soviet writers Kataev and Polevoy, and Czechoslovak and Bulgarian journalists Marklai and Stures, etc. Eleven people. They conducted detailed visits to the teaching measures and learning situation of the students in the training class, which gave our work great encouragement. This is because it is difficult for international friends to understand that the capitalist industrialists and businessmen in our country, who belong to the exploiting class, are consciously and voluntarily enthusiastic about breaking capitalism and establishing socialist learning. They regard it as a miracle and pay very attention to it. Therefore, they constantly visit earnestly, hoping to understand and publicize it. This fact also shows that the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in our country has great international significance.

The above immature opinions are for your criticism and correction!

### 工商业者要继续加强改造  温少鹤的发言

    工商业者要继续加强改造
    温少鹤的发言
    这次会议，我听了周恩来主席所作“关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告”。这一为国辛劳、远道访问的伟大成就，使我敬佩之余深深受到感动。我又随各委员一道听了毛主席在最高国务会议上所作关于“正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话，给我们亲切而伟大的教导。我从事于工商业联合会的工作。毛主席此次教导，提到社会主义改造中的资本主义工商业的改造问题。工商业者在全行业公私合营后，一般是有进步的，但还有少数的人存在着不要改造、无须学习的思想，毛主席对此作了批判。去年12月全国工商业联合会曾召开会员代表大会。会议前夕，毛主席在各省、市工商代表团负责人座谈会上提出了这一问题，并指示工商业者要发扬爱国主义的精神，把个人利益与国家利益结合起来；要努力学习，加强改造；要积极搞好生产经营，为国家社会主义建设贡献才能。这些指示，给予工商业者极大的鼓舞。我想就毛主席对工商业者两次教导，谈一谈有关的情况和个人的体会。
    全国工商联闭会后，四川省工商联在当地党政的指导和支持下，随即开会传达。传达的内容，除会议的精神和决议外，着重传达了毛主席的发扬爱国主义精神的指示，也传达了党和政府对资本主义工商业的赎买政策，定息七年不变（从1956年起），定息很少或莫有私股的中、小型工商业者和资方代理人可划分为小资产阶级，主要意义在使大、中、小均能各安其心、各得其所，发挥他们的积极性。对专区各市、县的传达，由于四川区域辽阔，就出、列席全国会议的代表与一部分省工商联委员组织力量，分赴各地协助进行，规定每一市、县的传达工作应结合当地情况，适当解决问题和反映问题，同时并检查督促当地工商联的工作，并在各地传达完毕后，由省工商联召集担任传达工作者开会座谈，汇报情况，交换意见，交流经验。这一办法，系避免流于形式，为传达而传达，对如何贯彻实施传达的精神，起着推动作用。在这里我还要特别提到的，就是周恩来主席在访问了十一个国家后，回国时经过重庆，接见了当地党政机关工作人员，并在重庆市工商联会员代表大会进行传达报告后莅临会所，接见了全体代表，一道摄影，这是很难得的机会，对于发挥工商业者的积极性有着无比的推动力量。
    在传达毛主席关于发扬爱国主义精神的指示，初听起来以为是常常提到的话，闻之已熟，不足为奇，及经一再学习，结合实际，反复研究，才有深一层的体会。发扬爱国主义的精神不是一句空泛的话，过去曾提过爱国守法的口号，其后又提出了利用、限制、改造的政策。这次毛主席提出爱国主义，对工商界的要求又提高了。陈云副总理在“八大”的发言中，曾指出“在资本主义工商业的社会主义改造取得了决定性的胜利以后，在过去几年中，特别是过去两年中，国家经济部门为限制资本主义工商业而采取的一些措施已经成为不必要了。这些措施在当时是必要的，收到了成效的，……目前如果继续采取这些措施，就必然会妨碍国民经济的进一步发展。”这是由于全行业公私合营后工商业社会主义改造基本完成，我国无产阶级同资产阶级之间的矛盾已经基本上解决。我们国内的主要矛盾，已经是先进的社会主义制度同落后的社会生产力之间的矛盾。集中力量，解决这个矛盾，是全国人民当前的主要任务，同样地也是我们工商业者的主要任务。作为一个爱国的工商业者，为了完成这个任务，就应该继续接受改造，成为名副其实的劳动者，并在改造过程中积极贡献我们的技术知识和管理知识，充分发挥公私合营企业的优越性，大力发展生产力，又多、又好、又快、又省地推进我国社会主义建设事业。我们工商业联合会则应继续发挥它的独特作用，本着毛主席爱国主义的指示，进一步做好团结、教育、改造工商业者的工作，协助政府调动工商界一切积极力量，为社会主义事业服务。
    自全业合营后，工商界进入了新的阶段，也就有新的工作和问题。毛主席所提的爱国主义能不能解决一切问题呢？我的体会是完全可能的，只要我们随时随地都能把个人利益与国家利益结合起来，对于新的工作和问题就可以迎刃而解。试就公私关系来说，如果我们对公方、对职工处得不好，就会影响生产经营，于企业不利，也就是于国家不利。因此必须主动靠拢公方和职工，搞好关系，才对得起国家，对得起自己。再就私私关系来说，大、中、小型企业之间要团结，企业内部要团结，我们也要想到如果私私关系搞不好，就会影响生产经营，不利于国家，大家自然就团结起来了。我们为甚么要参加劳动竞赛，争取成为先进生产者和先进工作者，为甚么要投入增产节约运动，正是为了发挥积极性，有利于国家生产建设。我国的民族资产阶级一般是爱国的，由于今后还须进一步彻底完成社会主义改造，与全国人民一道进入社会主义社会，这就要求我们统一认识，提高认识。我们要认识社会主义与爱国主义的一致性，还要把爱国主义与国际主义结合起来。总的说来，毛主席提示的发扬爱国主义的精神，我们果能深切体会，与实际行动相结合，就可搞好工作，解决问题，成为万能的钥匙，成为破除一切私见、搞好一切业务、完成一切计划的伟大动力。
    全业合营后，工商业者的思想认识，有不同程度的进步，发挥了他们的积极性，有越来越多的人投到社会主义竞赛中来。以重庆市为例，去年第二季度参加竞赛的私方人员是四千零一十九人，第三季度增加到五千七百五十八人，其中获得了先进生产者、先进工作者光荣称号和受到物质奖励的有五百零三人；第四季度参加竞赛的更为普遍，现正热烈地进行评选，金属加工、复制印染几业，已选出先进生产者六十四人，副食品商业评选的五十八个先进工作者中，有四十个是私方人员。有的担任工程师，积极推广先进经验，努力改进技术设备，改进了脚踏印字机，提高生产效率30％左右；有的担任车间主任，改进了制造钢笔杆、橡皮插头的方法，生产能力较过去提高五倍，还降低了废品率；有的担任采购工作，在去年猪肉供应紧张和实行植物油定量之际，及时在外区采购花油一百多担，在黄花缺货时，又在产区采购回来了一百多担黄花，供应了市场的需要。这是工商业者表现积极性的一面。但是，也还有少数的人在全业合营后存在着作客思想、雇佣思想，认为原材料的节省或浪费、产品质量的好坏，与我无关，营业额的多寡、企业的赚折，也与我无关，我反正拿这些工资就万事大吉了。个别的人甚至嫌工资低了，工作松懈，表现拿好多钱做好多事，存在着“按酬付劳”的错误观点。重庆有一银耳店，橱窗玻璃从来莫有打烂过，合营后不久就打烂了十几块，这表示对人民的财产不够重视 。又如去年中秋到国庆的一段时间，重庆副食品供应比较紧张，在组织鲜活食品工作中，有的私方人员莫有根据过去经营的经验，提出建议，防止损失，结果鸡、鸭、兔共死亡一万六千多只，约值人民币八千元以上，显然忽视了国家的利益。这正如毛主席此次讲话中对工商业者所指出的消极的一面。这就需要工商业者努力改造，加强学习，要把个人利益与国家利益结合起来，建立主人翁思想，热爱合营企业，至低也要像过去精打细算爱护私人财产一样。我们除了保存旧有的好的经验而外，还应该以社会主义生产经营的优良制度和方法来改进旧的不良作风，才算有了正确认识，有了提高，才不愧为真正的爱国者，才于国家人民有利，也于自己有利。
    毛主席两次教导，对于工商业者的学习问题，表示深切的关怀。各地工商业者一般说来，都是要求学习、要求进步的，这次会议中，陈叔通副主席所作“关于工商业者短期讲习班工作的总结报告”就充分证明了这一点。四川省各省辖市和许多专区都开办了短期讲习班。重庆市现已开办第三期（名称叫工商界政治学校）。我在这里介绍一点情况。讲习班在办理进程中，先后来参观的国际友人，有印度共产党中央委员乔希，苏联作家卡达耶夫、波列沃伊和捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚新闻工作者马克莱、史杜莱斯等十一位。他们对讲习班的教学措施和学员的学习情况进行详细的访问，给我们的工作以莫大的鼓舞。这由于国际友人对我国属于剥削阶级的资本主义工商业者，自觉自愿地热心于破资本主义、立社会主义的学习，是难以理解的，他们认为是一种奇迹，寄予非常的注意，因而不断的殷切访问，希望得到了解加以宣传。这一事实，也说明了我国资本主义工商业的社会主义改造具有重大的国际意义。
    以上不成熟的意见，请各位批评指正！
