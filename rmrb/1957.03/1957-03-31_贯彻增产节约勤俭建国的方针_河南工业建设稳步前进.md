　　Implementing the policy of increasing production and practicing economy, and building the country through diligence and thrift
　　Henan's industrial construction is steadily advancing

    (Our report) Henan Province is currently making appropriate adjustments to urban industrial construction in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee, resolutely implementing the policy of steady advancement and building with diligence and thrift, and comprehensively carrying out a mass movement to increase production and practice economy. This was determined at the recent Provincial Party Committee Urban Work Conference.

    Since the country entered planned economic construction in 1953, the state has invested 654 million yuan in Henan Province's industrial construction, with a total of 26 projects above the quota limit. Currently, there are 945 factories and mines of various sizes throughout the province. By the end of 1956, the total industrial output value of the province (including state-owned, local state-owned, joint state-private, and cooperative-run enterprises) had reached 1.1 billion yuan, an increase of 18 times compared to 1949. Under the requirements of rapid industrial economic development, Henan Province's urban construction has also greatly developed, and many new industrial cities are growing. Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Xinxiang, and other cities are being expanded and rebuilt, and preliminary plans have also been made for Pingdingshan, Jiaozuo, Sanmenxia, ​​Hebi and other cities.

    This year, Henan Province's urban capital construction and industrial production tasks are still very heavy. During the country's first five-year plan period, of the 26 key projects built here, in addition to those that have been completed and put into production, 12 large factories and mines above the quota limit will be put into production or partially put into production this year, and it is expected that 11 factories and mines will be put into production next year. Some projects that the country has determined to build here during the second five-year plan period have already begun or are about to begin preparatory work. These projects were determined after appropriate adjustments were made in accordance with the principle that the country's financial and material resources are adapted to the scale and speed of construction. Therefore, the characteristics of this year's construction are: more investment in key projects, less investment in general projects; a larger proportion of productive investment, a smaller proportion of non-productive investment; a larger proportion of equipment installation, a smaller proportion of civil engineering; more cross-operations of machine installation and civil engineering, and stricter quality requirements. Generally speaking, this year's production and construction is still advancing.

    In order to adhere to the implementation of the policy of appropriate adjustment and steady advancement, and to ensure the comprehensive completion and overfulfillment of this year's plan, and lay a good foundation for the construction of the second five-year plan, Henan Province has decided to vigorously carry out a movement to increase production and practice economy throughout the province. In order to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy well, the Henan Provincial Party Committee Urban Work Conference decided to strengthen political and ideological leadership, conduct in-depth publicity and education among the broad masses, formulate production plans and plans to increase production and practice economy, improve enterprise management and technical management, continue to carry out the advanced production (work) movement in a deep and sustained manner, do a good job in personnel arrangements and the reallocation of labor, and strive to complete and overfulfill the 1957 economic construction plan.

　　贯彻增产节约勤俭建国的方针
　　河南工业建设稳步前进
    本报讯  河南省正在根据党中央的指示，对城市工业建设进行适当的调整，坚决贯彻执行稳步前进、勤俭建设的方针，全面开展群众性的增产节约运动。这是最近召开的省委城市工作会议上确定的。
    从1953年国家进入有计划的经济建设以来，国家对河南省的工业建设投资达六亿五千四百万元，限额以上的项目共有二十六个。现在全省已经有大小型厂、矿九百四十五个。全省工业总产值（包括国营、地方国营、公私合营、合作社营）截至1956年底止，已经达到十一亿元，比1949年增长了十八倍。在工业经济迅速发展的要求下，河南省的城市建设也有了很大的发展，许多工业新城市正在成长。郑州、洛阳、新乡等城市正在扩建和改建，平顶山、焦作、三门峡、鹤壁等城市初步规划也已经作出来了。
    今年，河南省的城市基本建设和工业生产的任务仍然十分繁重。国家在第一个五年计划期间，在这里建设的限额以上的二十六项重点工程，除了已经建成投入生产的而外，今年将有十二个限额以上的大厂矿投入生产或部分投入生产，预计明年有十一个厂矿投入生产。国家在第二个五年计划期间确定在这儿建设的一些项目，也已经或即将进行筹建工作。这些项目是根据国家的财力物力和建设规模速度相适应的原则，进行适当调整以后确定的。因此，今年建设的特点是重点项目投资多，一般项目投资少；生产性的投资比重大，非生产性的投资比重小；设备安装比重大，土建工程比重小；机器安装与土建工程交叉作业多，质量要求更加严格。总的来说，今年的生产建设还是前进的。
    为了坚持贯彻执行适当调整，稳步前进的方针，并保证全面完成和超额完成今年计划，为第二个五年计划建设打下良好基础，河南省决定在全省范围内大力开展增产节约运动。为把增产节约运动开展得好，河南省委城市工作会议决定要加强政治思想领导，在广大群众中进行深入的宣传教育，制定生产计划和增产节约计划。改进企业经营管理工作和技术管理工作，继续深入持久地开展先进生产（工作）者运动，做好人事安排和劳动力的重新调配工作，争取完成和超额完成1957年经济建设计划。
