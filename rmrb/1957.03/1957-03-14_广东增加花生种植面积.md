Guangdong Increases Peanut Planting Area

(Our report) This year, Guangdong Province plans to expand its peanut planting area to 4 million mu, based on last year's 3.62 million mu. The total output is planned to reach 5.04 million dan, an increase of 17.5% compared to last year. The increased production from the expanded area alone can supply more than 10 million people with edible oil for one month. Currently, Zhanjiang and Shaoguan prefectures, which are major peanut producing areas, have successively started sowing. Many agricultural cooperatives are also actively adopting methods such as rational crop rotation to expand the peanut planting area. Farmers in Lizhishan Township, Maoming County, who planted only 20 mu last year, have now planted more than 60 mu.

In order to ensure the completion of this year's peanut planting plan, the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee has decided to increase the unified purchase price of dry shelled peanuts by 10%-16%, and reduce the agricultural tax on peanut planting land by 30% of the taxable amount. It will also further implement the policy of "more production, more gain, more increased production, more retention" to encourage farmers to plant more peanuts.

    广东增加花生种植面积
    本报讯  广东省今年花生的种植面积，要在去年三百六十二万亩的基础上，扩大到四百万亩。总产量计划达到五百零四万担，比去年增产17.5％。单是扩大面积增产的部分，即可供应一千多万人一个月的食油需要。目前，盛产花生的湛江和韶关专区，已经陆续开始播种。有许多农业社，还积极采取合理轮栽等办法，扩大花生的播种面积。茂名县荔枝山乡的农民，去年只种二十亩，现在已种到六十多亩。
    为了保证完成今年花生的种植计划，广东省人民委员会已决定把干壳花生的统购价格调高10％—16％，对种植花生地的农业税，亦按应征税额减征三成，并进一步贯彻“多产多得，增产多留”的政策，以奖励农民多种花生。
