Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, March 16th:

    Recently, all four hundred-plus agricultural cooperatives in Pixian County, Sichuan Province, have made their accounts and assets public. Members of each cooperative are excitedly counting inventories and checking accounts, verifying their transactions using their "labor booklets," and raising questions and suggestions regarding past and future financial work.

    This democratic movement of economic transparency has greatly excited cooperative members and has also helped the cooperatives resolve many difficulties. In the past, many uncleared accounts, which were impossible to investigate, have been thoroughly clarified, one by one, within a few days, thanks to this mass mobilization. Many large cooperatives with "unclear inventories and countless assets" have also clarified their assets. The Unity Township Tenth Village First Cooperative, which lacked funds, discovered a batch of miscellaneous grains accumulated in the warehouse during the movement, which could be sold for 400 yuan to supplement its funds. Many agricultural cooperatives also clarified and plugged loopholes in financial work, such as waste and embezzlement of public funds.

    Agricultural cooperatives that have made faster progress have revised their financial management systems based on the opinions of the masses. It has been decided that in the future, the cooperative's income and expenditure, as well as member transactions, will be settled monthly and published in a timely manner.

    In the past, the financial management work of many agricultural cooperatives was not democratic enough. Members were not informed of the cooperative's income and expenditure, and in addition, errors in the accounts of some agricultural cooperatives caused doubts and dissatisfaction among the members. After this accounting, inventory check, and revision of the financial system, the members' dissatisfaction and doubts have been eliminated. They said: "Managing money like this makes people feel clear-headed, and they can rest assured when doing work and handing over investments." Members of Chen Deming Agricultural Cooperative in Chongxing Township were very uneasy because the cooperative's economy was not transparent, and fewer and fewer people were going to work. Recently, after the members of the cooperative clarified the accounts and revised the financial system in accordance with the spirit of democratic management of the economy, the members were very happy, and the number of people going to work increased by about 30%.

    Before the launch of the democratic movement of economic transparency in various cooperatives, the Pixian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party spent seven days summoning more than 400 accountants from agricultural cooperatives throughout the county to summarize the financial accounting work of 1956. It affirmed the achievements and, at the same time, educated some accountants to examine their shortcomings and errors in embezzling or stealing public funds, and encouraged all accountants in the county to actively participate in this movement.

    郫县四百多个农业社
    经济公开　社员满意
    新华社成都16日电　四川省郫县的四百多个农业社最近都公开了社的账目和家底。各社社员都在兴奋地清点库存和查账，用“劳动手册”核对自己的往来账目，并对过去和今后的财务工作提出询问和建议。
    这次经济公开的民主运动给了社员很大的兴奋，也给社解决了不少困难。过去许多无法查明的错账由于这次发动群众一笔笔地核对，一般都在短短的几天之内彻底弄清了。许多“库存不清，财产无数”的大社，这次也查清了家底子。资金不足的团结乡十村一社在运动中查出积压在仓库中的一批杂粮，可卖成四百元充作资金。许多农业社还查清和堵塞了财务工作中的浪费、挪用公款等漏洞。
    工作进度较快的农业社已根据群众的意见修订了财务管理制度。决定今后定期把社的收支和社员往来账目，按月结账、及时公布。
    过去，许多农业社的财务管理工作不够民主，社里的收支情况不叫社员知道，再加上有的农业社账目发生差错，曾引起社员们的疑虑和不满。经过这次查账、清点库存和修订财务制度之后，社员们的不满和疑虑消除了。他们说：像这样经管钱财，叫人心里散亮了，做起活路和交出投资也放心了。崇兴乡陈德明农业社的社员因社里经济不公开，很不放心，出工的人越来越少。最近该社社员把账目查清并按照民主管理经济的精神，修订财务制度后，社员们很高兴，出工的人增加30％左右。
    各社展开经济公开的民主运动之前，中共郫县县委曾利用七天时间召集全县农业社的四百多名会计总结了1956年的财务会计工作，肯定了成绩，同时教育一部分会计检查了挪用或贪污公款的缺点和错误，鼓励全县会计积极参加这一运动。
