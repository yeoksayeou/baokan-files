Artificial Abortion Needs Appropriate Restrictions
Yan Renying's Speech

    During this conference, the discussion on birth control has been extensive, and I have benefited greatly from it. Originally, in the joint statement of the nineteen individuals, we had already expressed that "artificial abortion should only be performed in unavoidable circumstances." Because Commissioners Li Dequan and Shao Lizi have different views, I would like to reiterate my personal opinion from the perspective of an obstetrician and gynecologist.

    The Harm of Unrestricted Artificial Abortion

    Commissioner Li Dequan stated in her speech that "artificial abortion not only harms women's bodies, work, and studies, but also fails to achieve the purpose of birth control." I agree with this view. However, since this method has shortcomings and may be harmful to the people, we should not place it among the people without any restrictions. Currently, our contraception efforts have not been well developed, and some people still have doubts about contraception methods. If we simultaneously open up artificial abortion, it will inevitably cause a misconception among a certain group: they will think that contraception can be used or not, because there is artificial abortion as a backup! In this way, although we subjectively say that we are not advocating artificial abortion, it actually seems like we are putting two paths in front of inexperienced young people, saying that one is not good, but they are free to choose, and I think it is irresponsible to let inexperienced people take risks.

    Although we do not like to use coercive methods, I don't think it is necessarily right not to set a safety rule for dangerous things. For example, when we walk or drive on the street, we must abide by traffic rules and obey the traffic police. This cannot be considered coercion, because it is to protect our safety. Our streets are narrow, and transportation is chaotic, so traffic order is especially important.

    Today, there should be a kind of restriction on artificial abortion surgery, just like traffic rules, because contraception knowledge has not been popularized, and it is impossible to perform a large number of artificial abortions. At present, our obstetrics work mainly relies on midwives. There are few obstetricians, and even fewer people are experienced in artificial abortion surgery. If we do not impose restrictions based on voluntariness, the number of artificial abortion surgeries will inevitably increase, and the quality of surgery will be further reduced, which will be detrimental to people's health. In addition, our beds are also very insufficient. Although it is best for pregnant women to be hospitalized for delivery, most of them still deliver at home even in large cities (only 40% of pregnant women in Beijing are hospitalized for delivery). The situation in rural areas is even worse. Therefore, today, we must still impose certain restrictions on artificial abortion surgery. This restriction is not to avoid trouble, but to better protect the health of mothers. Although there are conditional restrictions, the implementation should be based on different situations. With the improvement of medical and health conditions and the popularization of contraception knowledge, these conditional restrictions can also be modified or completely cancelled, depending on which is more beneficial to the people. It's like we have the habit of abiding by traffic rules, we improve transportation and streets, and traffic police can also be cancelled.

    The Soviet Union's Cancellation of Restrictions Has Its Specific Conditions

    The Soviet Union cancelled the restrictions on artificial abortion last year. This was to prevent people from using other methods of abortion. The Soviet people have decades of contraception experience and habits, and the level of medical work is also high. They have 20,670 obstetricians and gynecologists nationwide, with 138,000 obstetrics beds and 52,800 gynecology beds. There are also more than 23,000 beds in collective farm maternity hospitals. Therefore, after the Soviet Union cancelled these restrictions, because the people already have widespread contraception knowledge, it is not certain that many people will ask for artificial abortion. Even if they do, there are strong technical conditions to guarantee it. The Soviet Union did this based on their needs and specific conditions. The measures taken to better protect women's health are different from our situation. Copying the Soviet experience may not achieve the goal of protecting women. Therefore, I believe that when we consider whether to lift the restrictions on artificial abortion, in addition to other pros and cons, we should also first estimate the possibility of a large number of artificial abortions, so that there will not be a decision that artificial abortion mainly "depends on voluntariness, and some restrictions are lifted" in vain, and we cannot solve the problem for the people under the condition of ensuring safety. It is not right to emphasize difficulties, but it is also wrong to cause losses to people's health if the conditions that should be considered and prepared are not met.

    The Reliability of Contraception Methods is Still Very High

    Some people say that artificial abortion cannot be restricted because contraception methods are unreliable. I think it is right to say that contraception is not ideal and not perfect, but if these contraception methods are used seriously, the purpose of planned birth can be achieved. The population of many countries can maintain a certain rate of growth, not mainly by artificial abortion but mainly by contraception methods. Many of the commissioners here may have their own personal experience to prove it. So, why do some people get pregnant after using it? I think there are several possibilities: (1) The quality of drugs and tools is not good: the masses reflect that the ointment is irritating, the condoms are easy to break, or sometimes the supply is suddenly cut off. This situation should be resolved as soon as possible. If domestic mass production is difficult, the import restrictions should be relaxed. (2) Shortcomings in publicity and guidance methods, or the method is not well chosen or the explanation is not sufficient. (3) Some people are afraid of trouble and are unwilling to use it regularly. All these can be gradually resolved as long as we widely carry out publicity and ensure the supply and quality of drugs, and it is also what we should all strive to do. Comrade Yuan Anquan from Mudanjiang and Comrade Yang Zhenguo from Harbin said in their speeches that "at present, many people are willing to have artificial abortion for birth control, but do not actively use various contraception methods. This should be noted." They also said: "Although the various contraception methods currently promoted cannot achieve 100% results, as long as they are tried patiently, they are indeed reliable to a certain extent, and can achieve the purpose of planned birth and reduce fertility." I think there must be more than just a few of us who take the same view. Artificial abortion should only be performed in unavoidable circumstances.

    Commissioner Shao Lizi mentioned in his speech that some female workers in Shanghai used various methods to induce abortion after pregnancy, which I think is worthy of sympathy. But the thorough solution should still be contraception, not artificial abortion. In the past, because contraception knowledge was not popularized, women had no choice but to take quinine, etc., after pregnancy. If contraception knowledge is vigorously promoted, this kind of risky action will definitely be reduced. Of course, if you talk about contraception after pregnancy, it is too late. It is "distant water that cannot quench immediate thirst." The solution to the current problem should be to see which is less dangerous, "surgery" or "no surgery," and then take that one. If the person concerned does not agree, we must patiently explain it. Because sometimes young people cannot see the long-term pros and cons, and we should be responsible for pointing them out to them. Of course, it is also wrong to overemphasize the harmfulness without combining it with the specific situation. In the future, in order not to "dig a well when thirsty," the fundamental solution is to vigorously promote contraception. Using artificial abortion to "quench immediate thirst" should only be done in unavoidable circumstances. For people with physical illnesses, such as women with heart disease, because they are afraid that pregnancy or childbirth will aggravate their condition or even endanger their lives, of course, they should avoid pregnancy. If contraception is unsuccessful, whether to have artificial abortion depends on whether it is safer to have surgery at that time? Or is it safer to let him/her become pregnant and give birth? That is to say, it is decided whether to have surgery, when to have surgery, and what kind of surgery to have based on the premise of maximizing the safety of the mother's health. The attitude of doctors when considering these issues is not rash. It is based on the greatest interests of women. Whether for healthy people or sick people, we must think about many aspects. If we have over-considered health issues, I think there are, but it is definitely not to avoid trouble. In fact, persuading a person not to have surgery is much more "troublesome" than having an artificial abortion.

    Issues to Consider When Performing Sterilization Surgery

    As for sterilization surgery, it generally does not have major harm and can be relaxed. The original provision required at least four children, which is not necessarily necessary. However, this surgery cannot be regretted once it is done, so it must be carefully considered first. We generally want at least one child to be over ten years old, because older children have a smaller chance of getting acute infectious diseases and dying. If there are only two children under the age of four, it is better to wait for sterilization. Although the age of the parents does not affect the surgical results, if the man and woman or one of them is too young, the possibility of a change in the marriage relationship should also be considered. These considerations are necessary, but whether they should be used as limiting conditions is worth studying.

    In short, we propose birth control for the health and happiness of the people. We must never act with undue haste or adopt inappropriate measures that affect the health and happiness of the people. We should focus our main efforts on the publicity, guidance, and research of contraception. Under appropriate conditions, sterilization surgery can be performed when the person is willing. Artificial abortion should only be performed in unavoidable circumstances. Since everyone's opinions on artificial abortion are not entirely consistent, I suggest that the Ministry of Health convene relevant parties to widely solicit opinions before making a decision. And I hope that after a decision is made, appropriate explanations and mobilizations will be made to medical staff first, so that the work can be carried out smoothly.

    In addition, I also agree with Comrade Guo Xiangxin's opinion. When we launch birth control publicity, we should also pay attention to avoiding creating an overly tense atmosphere. I hastily put forward some immature opinions, and I hope everyone will correct me. (Attached picture)

### 人工流产需要适当限制　严仁英的发言

专栏：

　　人工流产需要适当限制
　　严仁英的发言
    这次大会上，关于节制生育的问题讨论很久，使我受益很大。本来在十九人联合发言中我们已表示过“人工流产只应在不得已的情况下才作”，因为李德全和邵力子委员有不同看法，我想再从妇产科工作者的角度上申说一下我个人的意见。
    对人工流产不加限制的害处
    李德全委员在发言中说“人工流产不但对妇女身体、工作、学习等有所损害，并且也不能达到节育的目的”，我同意这种看法；但是我想这个方法既然有缺点，对人民可能有害，我们就不应当把它放在人民中间不加限制。我们目前避孕工作还未很好的开展，有的人们对避孕方法还有怀疑，如果我们同时开放人工流产，必然会在一定群众中引起错觉：他们认为避孕是可以采用，也可以不用，反正有人工流产作退步！这样我们主观上虽然说不是提倡人工流产，而实际上好像放在无经验的年青人面前两条路，说那一条不好，但是可以自由选，让没有经验的人去冒危险我想是对他们不够负责的。
    虽然我们不喜欢用强制方法，但是对危险的事不定出个安全规则来我想也不一定对。比如我们在街上走路、开车，要遵守交通规则，要服从交通警指挥，这不能算强制，因为这是保护我们的安全。我们的街窄，交通工具杂乱，所以交通秩序尤其重要。
    今天对于人工流产手术，应当有像交通规则一样的一种限制，因为避孕知识尚未普及，而大量作人工流产也不可能。目前我们产科工作还主要依赖助产士。产科医生少，对人工流产手术有经验的人更少，如果要根据自愿不加限制，则人工流产手术数目必然增加，而手术质量就会更为降低，这就对人民健康不利。另外，我们床位也很不够，虽然产妇最好住院分娩，目前即使在大城市中亦大半在家（北京市只40％产妇住院分娩），即使享受公费医疗的人也有一部分不能住院，农村情况更不必说，所以今天还必须对人工流产手术加以一定限制，这种限制不是为了怕麻烦，而是为了更好地保护母亲的健康。虽有条件限制，在执行中也要根据不同情况来研究决定。随着医药卫生情况的改善和避孕知识的普及，这些条件限制还可以修改或完全取消，那就看那样作对人民更有利。这就像我们有了遵守交通规则的习惯，我们改善了交通工具和街道，交通警也可以取消。
    苏联取消限制有他的具体条件
    苏联去年取消了对人工流产的限制，这是为了避免人们去用其它方法堕胎；苏联人民已有几十年避孕经验和习惯，医疗工作水平亦高，他们全国有二万零六百七十位妇产科医师，有十三万八千张产科床，五万二千八百张妇科床。在集体农庄产院里还有另外二万三千多张床。所以在苏联取消这些限制之后，因为人民已有普及的避孕知识，所以也不一定有很多人去要求作人工流产，即使有，也有雄厚的技术条件作保证。苏联这样作是根据他们的需要与具体条件。为了更好地保护妇女健康所采取的措施，我们情况不同，搬用苏联经验，就不一定能达到保护妇女的目的。因此，我认为在我们考虑是否取消人工流产的限制时，除去其他方面的利害关系外，也应当先把大量作人工流产的可能估计一下，那样才不会徒然有一个人工流产主要“取决于自愿，取消一些限制”的决定。而不能在保证安全的条件下给人民解决问题。强调困难虽然不对，应当考虑和准备的条件不具备，而造成人民健康的损失，也是不对的。
    避孕方法的可靠性还是很大的
    有人说人工流产不能限制，因为避孕方法靠不住；我想，说避孕法不合乎理想不尽善尽美是对的，但如果认真地使用这些避孕法，是可以达到计划生育的目的。许多国家的人口，所以能保持一定速度的增长，多不是靠人工流产而主要是靠避孕方法。在座许多位委员们都可能有自己的亲身经验可以证明。那么，为甚么有人用了又怀孕？我想有几个可能：（一）药物工具质量不好：群众反映药膏有刺激性，阴茎套容易破，或有时忽然断了供应；这种情况应当从速解决，如国内大批生产有困难，应当放宽入口限制；（二）宣传指导方法的缺点，或是方法选择的不好或是说明的不够；（三）有些人怕麻烦不肯经常用。凡此种种只要我们广泛开展宣传，保证药物的供应和质量，都能逐步解决，也是我们大家应当努力作到的。代表牡丹江的袁安全同志和哈尔滨的杨振国同志在发言中说“目前有很多人为了节育均愿作人工流产，而不积极利用各种避孕方法，这是应当注意的。”又说：“现在宣传的各种避孕法，虽不能达到百分之百的效果，只要耐心试用，确实有一定程度的可靠性，并能得到有计划的生育和减低生育的目的。”我想采取同样看法的，一定还不只我们几个人。人工流产只在不得已的情况下才作
    邵力子委员发言中提到上海女工怀孕后用各种方法想引起流产的事，我想是值得同情的。但是彻底解决的办法还应当是避孕，而不是人工流产。过去因为避孕知识未普及，妇女怀孕后没有办法才去吃奎宁等，如果大力宣传避孕知识，这种采取冒险行动的事定会减少。当然如果怀孕之后你再去谈避孕是晚了，是“远水解不了近渴”，当前问题的解决应当看“作手术”与“不作手术”那一个危险更小，就采取那一个，当事人不同意就要耐心说明。因为有的时候年青人看不到长远利害关系，我们看到了就应当负责指给他。当然，过度强调危害性而不结合具体情况也是不对的，今后为了不“临渴而掘井”，还是只有大力推广避孕法才是根本办法。用人工流产来“解近渴”应当是只是在不得已情况下才作。对于身体有病的人，例如患有心脏病的妇女，因为怕妊娠或分娩会加剧病情甚至危及性命，当然更应当避孕。避孕不成功时是否作人工流产，那就要根据当时这个人的情况是作手术安全？还是任他妊娠分娩更安全？也就是说根据对母体健康最大安全的前提来决定是否手术、何时手术和作何种手术。医生们考虑这些问题时的态度不是轻率的，是从妇女的最大利益出发的，无论对健康人或有病的人，都要想到许多方面，若说我们有过多考虑健康方面问题我想是有的，但绝不是为了怕麻烦。实际上说服一个人不作手术要比作一个人工流产“麻烦”的多多。
    作绝育手术应当考虑的问题
    至于绝育手术一般无大危害，是可以放宽限度，原规定要求至少有四个孩子，就不一定必要。不过，这个手术作完不容后悔，所以必须先慎重考虑，我们一般总是愿意至少有一个孩子已超过十岁，因为孩子大些，得急性传染病与死亡机会小些。如果只有两个四岁以下的孩子还是慢些绝育的好。父母年龄虽然不影响手术结果，但如男女双方或一方年纪太轻，也要考虑婚姻关系改变的可能性。这些考虑是必须的，但是否作为限制的条件，还值得研究。
    总而言之，我们提出节育是为了人民健康与幸福，我们绝不可操之过急，或采用不妥当的措施而影响人民健康和幸福；我们应当把主要力量放在避孕的宣传、指导和研究上，在适当条件下，本人自愿时可以作绝育手术，人工流产只应在不得已情况下才作。由于大家对人工流产意见不全一致，我建议卫生部召集有关各方人士广泛征求意见，再作决定。并且希望在有了决定之后，首先向医务人员作适当的说明和动员，以便使工作顺利进行。
    此外，我也同意郭向欣同志的意见。在我们展开节育宣传的时候也要注意避免造成过度紧张空气。匆匆提出几点不成熟意见，希各位指正。（附图片）
