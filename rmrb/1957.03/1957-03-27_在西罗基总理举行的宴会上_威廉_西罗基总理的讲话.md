Respected Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Respected Premier of the State Council, Dear Comrades and Friends:
    Thanks to the kind invitation of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, we have had the opportunity to visit a series of provinces and cities in the People's Republic of China, to meet with workers, farmers, and intellectuals, and to have sincere and friendly conversations with them about our common tasks and goals, and about our respective experiences in building socialism. These unforgettable meetings have been indelibly etched in our hearts, providing us with a wealth of impressions and absorbing much knowledge that we will use in our future work.
    During our visit to the People's Republic of China, we saw the immortal relics of the long-standing Chinese culture, which testify to the enormous contribution of the Chinese people to the cultural development of all mankind.
    We visited cities connected with the great revolutionary traditions of the Chinese people, and we respectfully admire these cities with a feeling of emotion by all those who struggle for the freedom and happy life of all nations, for peace and socialism.
    During our journey, we saw the great Chinese territory, and we saw how the Chinese peasants, with their industrious hands, have turned their country into a garden full of flowers. We saw how they are making increasing contributions in the countryside on the basis of developing agricultural cooperative production to guarantee the lives of all the people.
    The enterprises and factories we visited left a very deep impression on us. In these enterprises and factories, the working class is rapidly mastering modern technology, and they are transforming People's China into an industrialized socialist power.
    Everywhere we went, we saw the noble qualities of the Chinese people, the creators of all these achievements, and we saw the genius, industrious wisdom, humility, and revolutionary enthusiasm of the Chinese people. In your great and beautiful country, our love and admiration for the Chinese people increases every day. Under the experienced leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people, with their magnificent construction cause, guarantee the socialist development of their country and have a significant impact on the entire development of modern mankind.
    Our visit to your beautiful country convinces us that the Chinese people are irresistibly marching towards new glorious victories on their socialist path and will surely achieve their great goals.
    Please allow me to toast to the great Chinese people, to their further achievements in socialist construction, and to the prosperity of their motherland! At the same time, please allow me to raise my glass to Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council, to Comrade Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and to Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China!

　　在西罗基总理举行的宴会上
　　威廉·西罗基总理的讲话敬爱的中华人民共和国副主席同志，敬爱的国务院总理同志，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    由于中华人民共和国中央政府的盛情，使我们有机会访问了中华人民共和国的一系列的省区和城市，会见了工人、农民和知识分子，并和他们诚恳而友好地作了关于我们的共同任务和目标、关于我们彼此在建设社会主义中的经验交谈。这些难忘的会见已不可磨灭地刻在我们的心中，使我们获得了十分丰富的印象，并吸取了许多我们将在今后工作中运用的知识。
    我们在中华人民共和国的访问中看到了悠久的中国文化的不朽遗迹，它们证明了中国人民对全人类文化发展的巨大贡献。
    我们访问了和中国人民伟大革命传统相联系的城市，对这些城市，所有为各民族的自由和幸福生活，为和平和社会主义而斗争的人们都怀着感动的心情肃然起敬。
    在我们的旅程中我们看到了伟大的中国国土，看到了中国的农民如何以自己的勤劳的双手把自己的国家变成了一个开遍鲜花的花园，我们看到了他们在乡村里在发展农业合作化生产的基础上对保证全体人民的生活作着日益众多的贡献。
    我们所访问的企业和工厂给我们留下了非常深刻的印象，在这些企业和工厂里，工人阶级迅速地掌握着现代化技术，他们正在把人民中国变成为一个工业化的社会主义大国。
    我们在各个地方都看到了这一切成就的创造者中国人民的高尚品质，看到了中国人民的天才、勤劳智慧、谦虚和革命的热情。在您们伟大而美丽的国家里，我们对中国人民的热爱和敬佩每天都在增加，中国人民在光荣的中国共产党的富有经验的领导下以自己宏伟的建设事业保证着自己国家的社会主义发展，并且对现代人类的整个发展起着重大的影响。
    我们在你们美丽的国家的访问使我们深信中国人民正在他们社会主义的道路上不可阻止地走向新的光荣的胜利，并且将一定达到他们的伟大目的。
    请允许我为伟大的中国人民，为他们在社会主义建设中取得的进一步的成就，为他们的祖国的繁荣干杯！同时请允许我举杯为国务院总理周恩来同志、为中华人民共和国副主席朱德同志、为中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志干杯！
