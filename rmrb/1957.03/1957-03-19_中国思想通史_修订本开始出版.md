Revised Edition of "A General History of Chinese Thought" Begins Publication

The revised edition of "A General History of Chinese Thought," collectively written by Hou Wailu, Zhao Jibin, Du Guoxiang, and others, will be published by People's Publishing House in succession.

The revised edition of "A General History of Chinese Thought" is divided into four volumes, starting from the Yin and Zhou dynasties and ending in the late Ming dynasty. The book provides a comprehensive study of Chinese philosophical, logical, and social thought throughout the ages, emphasizing the relationship between the economic base and the superstructure, as well as ideology. The scope involved and the historical materials consulted are very extensive.

The first volume of this book was published before liberation, and the second and third volumes were published after liberation (the second and third volumes were collectively referred to as the second volume at the time). Compared with the old edition, the new edition has many additions and revisions. For example, the chapter on Lao Tzu's thought in the first volume has been supplemented with a great deal of material and explanation; a new chapter discussing the Yang Zhu school and the Song Xing Yin Wen school has been added, providing a more detailed analysis of the Yang Zhu school's morality of valuing self and emphasizing life, and the Song Yin school's ethical view of the Dao. In the second volume, a new chapter on the orthodox theological thought of the Han Dynasty has been added, revealing more deeply the sharp struggle between materialism and idealism in the Han Dynasty through the study of prophecies and "Bai Hu Tong Yi." The chapter discussing the materialist thought of the great historian Sima Qian has also been supplemented. In the third volume, the chapter on the thoughts of Xiang Xiu and Guo Xiang in the Jin Dynasty has been significantly augmented, with the authors pointing out the idealistic essence of the arguments about "existence and non-existence" in Xiang and Guo's "Commentary on Zhuangzi." At the end of this volume, a chapter on "The Convergence of Buddhist Studies and Wei-Jin Metaphysics" has been added, discussing the mutual influence between Wei-Jin Metaphysics and Buddhism.

In addition, the opening chapters of each volume—general summaries of the social history of each era—have also been supplemented and explained. The wording has also been revised and polished to make the book more popular and suitable for readers.

The first volume of "A General History of Chinese Thought" has already been published, and the second and third volumes will also be released soon; the fourth volume is currently being written and is scheduled to be published next year. (Lian)

    “中国思想通史”修订本开始出版
    由侯外庐、赵纪彬、杜国庠等集体编写的“中国思想通史”修订本，将由人民出版社陆续出版。
    “中国思想通史”修订本共分四卷。上起殷周、下迄明末。书中对中国历代的哲学思想、逻辑思想和社会思想作了综合的研究，并且着重说明了经济基础和上层建筑、意识形态间的关系，所涉及的范围和接触的史料都非常广泛。
    本书第一卷曾在解放前出版，二、三卷是在解放后出版的（当时第二、三两卷合称第二卷）。新版和旧版比较，有很多增补和修订的地方。例如：第一卷关于老子思想的一章补充了许多材料和说明；又新增了论述杨朱学派和宋銒尹文学派的一章，对杨朱学派贵己重生的道德论和宋尹学派的伦理化的道体观作了比较详尽的分析。在第二卷中，新增了关于汉代正统神学思想的一章，通过对谶纬和“白虎通义”的研究，更深入地揭示了汉代唯物主义和唯心主义的尖锐斗争。论述大史学家司马迁的唯物主义思想的一章也经过补充。第三卷关于晋代向秀、郭象思想的一章有比较重要的增补，作者指出了向、郭所作“庄子注”中关于“有无”问题的论证的唯心主义实质。在本卷末又补写了“佛学与魏晋玄学的合流”一章，论述魏晋玄学与佛学的互相影响。
    此外本书各卷首章——对各时代社会史的概括叙述，也都作了补充说明。文辞也加以修改润色，使本书比较通俗，更适宜于读者阅读。
    “中国思想通史”第一卷已经出版，第二、三卷也将于最近发行；第四卷正在编写中，预定明年可以出版。    　（涟）
