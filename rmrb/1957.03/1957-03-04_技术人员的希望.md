    Hopes of Technical Personnel
    Many technical leaders in the Central South region of the Ministry of Construction Engineering are troubled by the lack of time to lead technical work. The reason is that too many meetings take up a lot of their time. According to the chief engineer of the Central South First Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, large and small meetings took up 70% of his total time last year. After deducting the time spent receiving guests, approving official documents, and reviewing reports, it is difficult to go to the field. The chief engineer of the Second Company attended an average of 34 working days of meetings per month from September to November last year (each working day is calculated as eight hours). This means that in addition to attending meetings during the day, they also have to work overtime at night to attend meetings. In this way, he cannot even guarantee the time to look at drawings.
    These technical leaders hope that the leadership will quickly find ways to streamline meetings so that they have more time to research and lead technical work.

    技术人员的希望
    建筑工程部中南地区的许多技术领导人员，都为没有时间领导技术工作而苦恼。原因是过多的会议占去了他们大量的时间。据建筑工程部中南第一工程公司的总工程师自己统计，去年大、小会议占了他全年时间的70％，再除去接待来宾，批公文，审查表报等占用的时间，就很难下到现场去了。第二公司的总工程师，去年9至11月份每月平均开会三十四个工作日（每个工作日按八小时计算）。这就是说，除了白天开会以外，晚上还要加班加点开会。这样，他连看图纸的时间也无法保证了。
    这些技术领导人员都希望领导方面赶快设法精简会议，让他们有更多的时间研究和领导技术工作。
