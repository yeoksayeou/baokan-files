In order to understand agricultural production in northern Shaanxi and further improve soil and water conservation work, I participated in the inspection team organized by the Northwest Agricultural Biology Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in September last year. We spent half a month in the three special districts of Yan'an, Suide, and Yulin in northern Shaanxi, conducting key visits and inspections. We visited the Yan'an Agricultural Experiment Station, the Suide Xindian Gou Soil and Water Conservation Experiment Station, the Jiucai Yuan Gou Soil and Water Conservation Key Demonstration Area, the Yulin Hongshixia Dam, and the Qingyun Mountain Sand Prevention Forest Belt. Along the way, we visited agricultural cooperatives to see their production and the lives of farmers. We also held separate discussions with leaders of the special commissioner's offices, county Party and government leaders, and relevant technical personnel, listening to their reports and opinions, and collecting some data. After returning to Wugong, we organized discussions among relevant teachers from the Northwest Agricultural College and personnel from the Northwest Agricultural Biology Research Institute of the Academy of Sciences to exchange views.

Through this inspection, we believe that agricultural production and soil and water conservation work in northern Shaanxi have achieved great accomplishments in recent years under the correct leadership of the Party and government and with the strong support of the people. However, due to objective conditions and some subjective factors, there are still some problems that deserve study.

**Incomplete Implementation of Guidelines**

First, various parties have previously proposed guidelines for soil and water conservation work, such as "comprehensive measures for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water," "combined engineering and biological control," "treating the root cause before treating the symptoms," and "treating slopes before treating gullies." However, in actual work, there has been an emphasis on engineering measures and a neglect of agricultural biological measures and agricultural technology reforms. More emphasis has been placed on treating the symptoms than the root causes, more on treating points than the overall area, and more on treating gullies before slopes. This is one aspect. In addition, comprehensive planning is the first issue that should be resolved in soil and water conservation work, but northern Shaanxi agriculture still lacks a relatively mature comprehensive plan. The main direction of agricultural development is still not clear enough. Mountain slopes are still largely planted with annual grain crops, so soil erosion from sloping farmland is still very serious, placing a great burden on soil and water conservation projects. The improvement of farmers' production and living standards is very slow, which cannot better stimulate their enthusiasm for soil and water conservation work. Some even believe that soil and water conservation is a waste of manpower and resources, affecting farmers' production and living standards.

There are four main reasons for the above shortcomings: (1) Rational land utilization can only be achieved on the basis of agricultural collectivization. Although we have achieved a decisive victory in collectivization, it has not been long, and the capabilities of cooperative members are limited. (2) Rational planning of agricultural production has a high degree of scientific, technical, and practical nature, but at present, the number and quality of technical personnel in northern Shaanxi are not sufficient to propose a realistic and comprehensive rational plan. (3) Because these two points have not been recognized, there has been undue haste in the long-term planning of northern Shaanxi, and impatience and rashness are inevitable in the work, causing the masses to have opinions on land planning and soil and water conservation work. (4) At present, soil and water conservation projects are mainly led by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission. The soil and water conservation stations under the leadership of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission have relatively adequate engineering personnel, but very few agricultural biological workers. Therefore, they may unconsciously focus on engineering treatment in their consideration of problems and neglect agricultural reform and biological control. (5) There is a lack of close ties between relevant departments, making it impossible to achieve comprehensive and organic coordination. It is said that eight units have soil and water conservation departments, but there is little contact between the departments, and there is a lack of a unified leadership organization to consider the overall situation and provide comprehensive leadership.

Based on the above situation, we believe that the land planning, production reform, and soil and water conservation work in northern Shaanxi should first be gradually improved according to the existing strength of cooperative members, technical conditions, and development direction. Secondly, before planning, a group of local technical cadres should be trained to have a considerable level of scientific and technical knowledge and be able to make more realistic and feasible rational plans in combination with the local reality. Thirdly, in terms of agricultural production, we should start by planting high-yield crops and cash crops in river valleys and gentle slopes, converting dry land into paddy fields, increasing the multiple cropping index, improving varieties and cultivation techniques, and increasing fertilization to increase the yield per unit area. This will encourage farmers to reduce the planting of annual crops on mountain slopes and instead plant perennial pastures, fruit trees, and forests, which have stronger soil and water conservation capabilities and relatively high economic value. Fourthly, we should consider establishing a comprehensive leading organization for agricultural production and soil and water conservation work in northern Shaanxi, to truly combine agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy. On the basis of improving farmers' lives and production, a large-scale soil and water conservation movement should be launched, so that the interests of farmers are combined with the fundamental interests of the state in harnessing the Yellow River, and the current interests are combined with the long-term interests.

**"Top-Down" Approach is Wrong**

Second, in recent years, there has been a divergence of opinion in northern Shaanxi regarding the principles of "top-down" versus "bottom-up" in soil and water conservation projects themselves. The approach of the soil and water conservation stations is to first build large dams for demonstration, and then mobilize the masses to carry out small-scale soil and water conservation projects. However, some local administrative leaders believe that terraced fields should be built first, and then large dams, so as to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the dams. These two opinions have not yet been unified. However, based on our observation, the principle of "top-down" is correct. Facts have proved that we should appropriately estimate the role of dam projects. In 1953, under the leadership of the soil and water conservation station, Mizhi County launched a campaign to build large dams, building more than 300 dams. In the autumn of that year, most of them were destroyed by a flood. The Jiucai Yuan Gou Dam, personally led by the soil and water conservation station, was originally estimated to have a life of eight to ten years, but this year, after only three years, it has been completely silted up and is almost completely ineffective. The plans for irrigation, power generation, and fish farming have fallen through.

Our opinion is that soil and water conservation projects themselves must still follow the principle of "top-down" and "slope-before-gully." Otherwise, a large amount of state funds will be lost, not only failing to achieve the purpose of soil and water conservation, but also creating a bad influence among the masses. In addition, terracing projects north of Suide are prone to damage due to the loose soil, and further research and experiments should be conducted before推广 [tuī guǎng - popularizing/spreading/recommending] them.

**Plans Not Realistic Enough**

Third, the original plan for soil and water conservation work in northern Shaanxi was for fifteen years, later changed to a twelve-year plan, and then, due to optimistic estimates of dam construction projects, it was changed to complete in seven years. This year has passed one year, and there are still six years left. However, the general opinion of local Party and government leaders is that based on the experience of dam construction failures and the lack of labor in northern Shaanxi, it is very problematic to complete all soil and water conservation projects in six years while also doing a good job in production and building roads. We believe that this opinion is worth considering. The seven-year completion plan needs to be revised according to objective reality. On the other hand, local cadres believe that the local people's lives are hard, and the burden is heavier than that of the people in other regions (roads and soil and water conservation projects). This is a fact. Therefore, in addition to the necessary support from the state to northern Shaanxi, we should act according to our capabilities. This is a more widespread cry and should be noted.

Because the time of this inspection was too short and the understanding of the situation was not deep and detailed enough, the opinions may be one-sided and subjective, and are only provided for reference. (Attached image)

    怎样改进陕北水土保持工作
    辛树帜的发言
    为了了解陕北的农业生产，和进一步改进陕北水土保持工作，我曾于去年9月间，参加了中国科学院西北农业生物研究所组织的考察团，用了半个月的时间，到了陕北的延安、绥德、榆林三个专区，进行了重点参观访问和考察工作，参观了延安农业试验站、绥德辛店沟水土保持试验站、韭园沟水土保持重点示范区、榆林红石峡水坝、青云山防沙林带。沿途顺便访问了农业社的生产和农民生活，同时与各专署、县党政领导及有关技术人员分别进行了座谈，听取他们的报告和意见，并收集了部分资料。返回武功我们又组织西北农学院部分有关教师和科学院西北农业生物研究所人员进行了座谈，交换了意见。
    通过这次考察，我们认为陕北农业生产和水土保持工作几年来，在党政正确领导和人民大力支持下已经获得了巨大的成就。但由于客观条件及一些主观因素所限，还存在一些问题值得研究。
    贯彻方针不全面
    一、对水土保持工作过去由各方面曾提出过“农、林、牧、水综合措施”，“工程和生物共同防治”，“治标必先治本”， “治沟必先治坡”等方针。但在实际工作中恰恰偏重于工程措施而轻于农业生物措施和农业技术改革，治标多于治本，治点多于治面，治沟先于治坡，这是一方面，另外，全面规划是水土保持工作首先应当解决的问题，而到现在陕北农业还缺乏一个比较成熟的全面规划——农业发展的方向究竟应以什么为主还不够明确，山坡地仍然以绝大部分种植一年生粮食作物，因而坡面农田水土流失仍很严重，给水土保持工程以很大的负担。农民生产和生活提高得很慢，不能更好的激发他们进行水土保持工作的积极性。甚至认为水土保持劳民伤财，影响了农民的生产和生活。
    产生以上缺点的原因主要有四：（一）土地合理利用只有在农业合作化的基础上才能实现。目前我们虽然在合作化方面已取得了决定性的胜利，但是为时尚短，社员的能力有限。（二）农业生产之合理规划具有高度的科学性技术性和现实性，但目前陕北的技术人员不论在数量和质量上还不可能提出切实可行的全面的合理规划。（三）由于没有认识到上述两点，因而对陕北远景规划操之过急，表现在工作中难免急躁冒进，引起群众对土地规划和水土保持工作有意见。（四）目前水土保持工程主要由黄委会领导。在黄委会领导下的水土保持工作站中工程人员比较充实，而农业生物工作人员则很少。因而他们在考虑问题时不知不觉的会偏重于水土保持工程治理，而忽略了农业改革和生物防治。（五）有关部门缺乏密切连系，不可能作到全面的有机配合。据说，有八个单位都设有水土保持工作部门，但各部门联系很少，缺少一个统一的领导机构来统盘考虑全面领导。
    根据以上情况，我们认为：对陕北的土地规划、生产改革和水土保持工作，首先应当根据现有的社员力量、技术条件和发展方向逐步提高。其次是在规划之前要训练一批地方上的技术干部使他们有相当的科学技术水平，并能结合当地现实情况作出比较切实可行的合理规划。其三是在农业生产方面，目前应从川地、缓坡地种植高产作物、经济作物，改旱地为水地，增加复种指数，改良品种及耕作技术，增加施肥等以提高单位面积产量入手，促进农民在山坡地少种一年生农作物，改种多年生牧草及果树和森林等水土保持能力较强而且经济价值相对高的作物。其四是考虑一个陕北农业生产和水土保持工作全面领导的机构，真正作到农林牧水相结合。在提高农民生活和生产的基础上，展开大规模的水土保持运动。使农民利益和国家治黄根本利益结合起来，目前利益和长远利益结合起来。
    “先下后上”的作法不对
    二、陕北几年来在水土保持工程本身方面还存在着先上后下和先下后上的原则分歧。水土保持工作站的作法是先筑大坝以示范，然后发动群众搞小型水土保持工程。而部分当地行政领导干部则认为先搞梯田，然后搞大坝，这样才能保证大坝的安全有效。这两种意见迄今尚未统一。但根据我们观察认为先上后下的原则是正确的。事实已经证明：我们对于大坝工程的作用应予适当的估计。米脂县1953年在水土保持站的领导下搞了一次打大坝运动，筑了三百多坝，当年秋季一次洪水便大部分被摧毁。水土保持工作站亲自领导的韭园沟大坝原估计坝之寿命为八到十年，而到今年仅仅三年就完全被泥淤平，几乎完全失效。灌溉、发电、养鱼之计划已经落空。
    我们的意见是水土保持工程本身还必须服从先上后下，先坡面后沟谷的原则。否则将使大量国家资金受到损失，不但不能达到水土保持目的，反而在群众中造成不良影响。此外梯田工程在绥德以北由于土质松散极易破坏，应进一步研究试验，行之有效后再推广。
    计划不够切合实际
    三、陕北水土保持工作原订为十五年规划，后改为十二年规划，以后由于对于打坝工程的乐观估计，而改为七年完成。今年已过去一年，尚有六年时间。但当地党政领导干部的一般意见认为根据打坝的失败经验及陕北劳力缺乏的情况，既要搞好生产又要修筑公路还要六年完成全部水土保持工程，是很成问题的，我们认为这个意见是值得考虑的。七年完成的计划是需要根据客观实际加以修改的，另一方面当地干部认为当地人民生活苦，而负担却比其他各区人民为重（公路和水土保持工程）这是事实，因而除了国家对陕北作必要的支援外更应量力而行，这是比较普遍的呼声，应予注意。
    由于这次考察的时间太短，情况了解不够深入细致，因而意见可能片面主观，仅提供参考。（附图片）
