    The draft budget for the 1957 fiscal year (from April 1st this year to the end of March next year) proposed by the Japanese government has been passed by the Japanese House of Representatives on March 9th. Now, the draft budget has been submitted to the House of Councilors for deliberation.

    The 1957 new budget, formulated by the former Ishibashi Cabinet, has revenues and expenditures of 1,137.4 billion yen each (360 yen equals one US dollar), an increase of more than 102.5 billion yen over the 1956 fiscal year, making it the largest in scale in post-war Japan.

    Regarding this budget, the Japanese government emphasizes that its characteristics are "tax cuts" and "active fiscal policy." The main reason the Japanese government is able to compile such a two-pronged budget that both implements tax cuts and expands government spending is due to Japan's economic development in the past two years, which is estimated to bring a natural increase in tax revenue of around 190 billion yen this year. At the same time, the Japanese government's inclusion of both "tax cuts" and "active fiscal policy" in the budget is also influenced by the possibility of dissolving the Diet and holding general elections, and carries many electioneering factors. The "Asahi Shimbun" commented on this budget as "good-looking on the outside, empty on the inside"; the Japanese magazine "Economist" called this budget a "political budget," and both are not without reason. That is to say, the fiscal foundation of this budget is not solid, it not only carries a great risk of causing inflation, but also has great deceptiveness for the people.

    The so-called "100 billion yen tax cut" looks good on the surface, with an income tax reduction of 109 billion yen, but after deducting the increase in other taxes, the actual tax cut is only 72 billion yen. In the 1957 budget, tax revenue, which accounts for the main part of the revenue, is 946 billion yen, an increase of more than 120.1 billion yen over the previous year. This means that the government is only using a small portion of the natural increase in tax revenue for tax cuts, and the tax burden on the entire population is still heavier than last year. At the same time, the tax cut method announced by the Japanese government favors the top and is thin on the bottom. Taking a family of three as an example, those with an annual income of 300,000 yen will only have a tax cut of about 3,200 yen, while those with an annual income of 2 million yen will have a tax cut of more than 216,000 yen. According to Japanese economic publications, those who can truly benefit from tax cuts are those with an annual income of more than 500,000 yen, but such people only account for 7.78% of salaried workers. As for the vast number of families with very low incomes who do not meet the tax standards, they will not receive any tax cuts at all. According to 1956 statistics, this type of family accounts for more than 65 million people out of the 90 million population in Japan. Not only that, but the Japanese government, while cutting taxes, has raised railway fares by 13%. Although the increase in rice prices has not been realized for the time being due to the internal contradictions of the Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition of the broad masses, the fiscal deficit of the special account for food management has been forcibly passed without being filled, which shows that the government has not abandoned its attempt to increase rice prices. The increase in transportation costs, the increase in gasoline tax, and the resulting price increases will further increase the burden on the lives of the broad masses of working people. This is the "substantial benefit" that the Japanese government's loudly proclaimed "100 billion yen tax cut" can bring to the broad masses of working people.

    The so-called "active fiscal policy" includes strengthening social insurance measures and other nice-sounding items, but the core content is the government's investment and loans to open up "industrial bottlenecks." This is a great service to the monopoly capital that is currently facing insufficient power, steel, and transportation capacity due to the development of production; the purpose is to help capitalists remove these obstacles, further expand production, expand the competitive strength of exports, so that they can seize greater profits. This is not only reflected in the increase of about 22 billion yen in the public works expenses related to roads and ports in the budget compared with last year, but is also particularly evident in the fiscal investment and loan plan belonging to the special account. The total amount of fiscal investment and loans this year reached 328 billion yen, an increase of nearly 70 billion yen over last year. Among them, investment and loans for electricity, steel, railways, and highways account for about one-third of the total amount. In addition, loans issued under the name of supporting small and medium-sized enterprises amounted to 43.5 billion yen, an increase of 16.5 billion yen over last year. However, the purpose of these loans is not so much for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises themselves, but rather to meet the requirements of monopoly capital. Because the vast majority of small and medium-sized enterprises in Japan are processing for large enterprises of monopoly capital. While large enterprises are massively updating equipment and improving technical conditions, if the small and medium-sized enterprises that process for large enterprises are not correspondingly improving technical equipment and improving production efficiency, it is difficult to expect to win in competition with foreign capital. Therefore, the so-called support for small and medium-sized enterprises is actually indirectly serving monopoly capital, and of course it also has the "killing two birds with one stone" purpose of eliminating the dissatisfaction of small and medium-sized capitalists.

    Other items that were listed as the focus of "active fiscal policy" when formulating the budget guidelines, such as strengthening social insurance measures, improving social welfare, and increasing housing, have also increased to varying degrees, but they are generally more sound than substance and are not large in number. In the fiscal investment and loan plan, there is a relatively large increase in investment and loans allocated to the Housing Loan Corporation and the Housing Corporation, but those who can borrow money from the public treasury or the corporation to build houses are mostly people in the middle and upper classes, and the more than half of the population with low incomes still have no chance to do so.

    The main source of funds for fiscal investment and loans is postal savings and simple insurance reserve funds managed by the Ministry of Finance (this part of the funds accounted for 88% of the total amount of fiscal investment and loan funds in 1957). This shows that fiscal investment and loans are originally a means of borrowing flowers to offer Buddha, using the concentrated small savings of the masses to seek the greatest profit for monopoly capital. And what the Japanese government touts as "active fiscal policy" as embodied in this year's fiscal investment and loan plan is obviously for whom it is "active" and for whom it serves.

    In the 1957 budget, as a result of negotiations with the United States, the expenditure on military expenses was decided to be 141.1 billion yen, an increase of only 400 million yen over last year. The plan to increase the army by 10,000 people has also been agreed by the United States and decided to be postponed to 1958, while the focus of military expansion will be placed on the air force and navy. Since the Defense Agency has a surplus of more than 20 billion yen every year, the fact that military spending has not increased significantly does not actually mean a reduction in the speed of rearmament, but compared with the past when it completely obeyed the United States and massively increased military spending every year, the US-Japan negotiations on military spending in 1957 did show some new signs. The Japanese government did not massively increase military spending as required by the United States. This, on the one hand, reflects the will of the people that the government cannot ignore; on the other hand, the Japanese government's focus on improving the quality of military strength and its preparation to manufacture precision weapons itself also reflects the trend that Japanese monopoly capital, after gaining a firm foothold in the economic recovery and development after the war, while relying on the United States, also hopes to seek a certain degree of independent development from under the control of the United States.

    In general, the Japanese government's new budget for 1957 basically reflects the demands of monopoly capital and serves the interests of monopoly capital. At the same time, it also sends some small favors to the middle class through tax cuts, support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and other items in order to win the support of the middle class for the conservative forces backed by monopoly capital. And for the broad masses of working people, the new budget can only bring them the threat of rising prices and inflation stimulated by the increase in fiscal expenditure and the expansion of equipment investment.

    从预算看日本政府的财政政策
    刘仲平
    日本政府提出的1957年度（从今年4月1日起至明年3月底止）预算草案，已于3月9日由日本国会众议院通过。现在，预算草案已提交参议院审议。
    这个由前石桥内阁制定的1957年度新预算，岁入和岁出各为一万一千三百七十四亿日元（三百六十日元合一美元），较1956年度增加了一千零二十五亿日元以上，其规模是日本战后最大的。
    关于这个预算，日本政府强调宣传它的特点是“减税”和“积极财政”。日本政府所以能够编制这样一个一方面实行减税，一方面扩大政府开支的双管齐下的预算，其依据主要是由于日本近两年来经济的发展，估计今年将有一千九百亿日元左右的税收的自然增加。同时，日本政府把“减税”和“积极财政”两者编入预算，还由于考虑到国会解散、举行大选的可能，带有不少竞选的因素。“朝日新闻”把这个预算评为“外表好看、内里空虚”；日本“经济学家”杂志把这个预算称为“政治性预算”，都不是没有道理的。这就是说，这个预算的财政基础并不坚实，它不仅具有引起通货膨胀的很大危险性，而且对于人民具有极大的欺骗性。
    所谓“千亿减税”，从表面上看，所得税的减税额是一千零九十亿日元，但扣除其他税种的加征额等等，实际减税额只有七百二十亿日元。而1957年度预算中，占岁入主要部分的税收收入，则为九千四百六十亿日元，比上年度增加了一千二百零一亿日元以上。这就是说，政府用来作为减税的，只不过是税收的自然增加中的一少部分，而就整个国民的纳税负担来说，仍然比去年加重了。同时，日本政府所宣布的减税办法是厚上薄下的。以三口之家为例，每年收入三十万日元的不过减税三千二百日元左右，每年收入二百万日元的，则将减税二十一万六千余日元。据日本经济刊物计算，真正能从减税中得到好处的，是每年收入在五十万日元以上的人，而这样的人却只占工薪生活者的7.78％。至于广大的不够纳税标准的收入很微的家庭，则完全得不到减税的好处。据1956年的统计，在日本全国九千万人口中，这类家庭所占人数在六千五百万人以上。不仅这样，日本政府在减税的同时，却把铁路运费提高了13％。米价的提高，虽然由于自由民主党内部的矛盾和广大群众的反对暂时没有实现，但粮食管理特别会计的财政赤字，是未加填补而强行通过的，这说明政府并未放弃提高米价的企图。运费的提高，汽油税的增加以及由之而来的物价上涨，将使广大劳动群众的生活负担更形加重。这就是日本政府叫得震天响的“千亿减税”所能带给广大劳动人民的“实惠”。
    所谓“积极财政”，其中虽然也包括了加强社会保险措施等等好听名目，但构成其中心内容的则是所谓打开“产业隘路”的政府的投资和贷款。这是对于由于生产的发展，目前面临着电力不足、钢材不足、运输力不足的垄断资本的极大效劳；目的在于帮助资本家扫除这些障碍，进一步扩大生产、扩大输出的竞争实力，以便它们攫取更大利润。这一点，除表现在预算中公共事业费内有关道路、港湾的费用较去年有了约二百二十亿日元的增加外，在属于特别会计的财政投资贷款计划上，表现得尤为明显。今年度的财政投资贷款总额达三千二百八十亿日元，比去年增加近七百亿日元。其中对于电力、钢铁、铁路、公路等的投资和贷款就占了总额的约三分之一。此外，在支援中小企业名义下发出的贷款达四百三十五亿日元，较去年增加了一百六十五亿元。但这些贷款的目的，与其说是为了中小企业本身的发展，不如说是为了满足垄断资本的要求。因为日本的中小企业绝大部分是为垄断资本的大企业进行加工的。在大企业大量更新设备、改进技术条件的同时，如不相应地使为大企业进行加工的中小企业也改进技术设备，提高生产效率，那就很难指望在同外国资本竞争中取胜。因此，所谓支援中小企业，实际上是间接地为垄断资本服务，当然也具有消除中小资本家的不满情绪的“一石二鸟”的目的。
    编制预算方针时列为“积极财政”重点的其它项目，如加强社会保险措施，提高社会福利，增进住宅等等有关经费虽然也有所增加，但大抵是雷声大雨点小，为数不大。财政投资贷款计划中，拨给住宅金融公库和住宅公团的投资和贷款有较多的增额，但能够从公库或公团借钱修建住宅的，多是中等以上阶层的人，占人口半数以上的收入低微的人仍与此无缘。
    财政投资贷款的主要资金来源，是大藏省所管理的邮政存款和简易保险公积金等等（1957年度这部分资金占财政投资贷款资金总额的88％）。这表明：财政投资贷款原就是借花献佛的一种手段，利用集中起来的群众的零星存款，来给垄断资本谋取最大利润。而表现在今年财政投资贷款计划上的日本政府所标榜的“积极财政”，究竟是对谁“积极”，为谁服务，那更是不言自明的了。
    1957年度预算中，有关军事费用的开支，同美国谈判的结果，决定为一千四百一十一亿日元，较去年只增加了四亿日元。增加陆军一万人的计划，也取得美国同意，决定推迟到1958年度，而把扩军重点放在空军和海军方面。由于防卫厅费每年都有二百亿日元以上的结余，军费之没有大量增加，实际上虽然并不意味着重整军备的速度的减低，但同过去完全听命于美国、每年大量增加军事开支的情况相比，1957年度关于军费开支的日美谈判中毕竟显示了某些新的迹象。日本政府没有按照美国要求大量增加军费，这一方面反映了不容政府忽视的民心所向；另一方面日本政府把加强军备的重点放在提高质量上，并且准备自制精密武器，则也反映了日本垄断资本在从战后的经济恢复和发展中站稳脚根以后，在依附美国的同时，又希图从美国控制下寻求某种自主发展的趋势。
    总起来说，1957年度日本政府的新预算，基本上是反映了垄断资本的要求，为垄断资本的利益服务的。同时，它又通过减税，支援中小企业等等名目，送给中间阶层一些小惠，以争取中间阶层对于以垄断资本为后台的保守势力的支持。而对于广大劳动人民来说，新预算所能带给他们的却只能是由于财政支出的增加、设备投资的扩大而刺激起来的物价上涨和通货膨胀的威胁。
