Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 27th — Members of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League (TDSL) and some Taiwanese compatriots in Shanghai held a symposium tonight to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the "February 28th" Uprising of the Taiwanese people. The symposium was convened by the Shanghai Branch of the TDSL.

    After the symposium began, Li Qiaosong, a member of the Shanghai Branch of the TDSL, suggested that everyone present stand up and observe three minutes of silence for the martyrs who died in the "February 28th" Incident.

    Lin Tianlie, a member of the Shanghai Branch of the TDSL, said at the meeting that on the tenth anniversary of the "February 28th" Uprising, the Taiwanese compatriots under American enslavement, knowing that the motherland is becoming increasingly strong, will be even more inspired and will more urgently look forward to returning to the embrace of the motherland soon. He said that members of the TDSL and Taiwanese compatriots in Shanghai should work with the people of the whole country to step up the opposition to American aggression and strive to make the greatest efforts for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. As long as we work together, Taiwan can certainly be liberated. Zhou Ming, a Taiwanese who participated in the "February 28th" Uprising, recalled the heroic course of the uprising at the meeting. Lin Sanliang of the Gaoshan ethnic group and Lin Sentian, a Taiwanese who returned from Japan, strongly condemned the conspiracies of "Two Chinas" and "Taiwan Independence," which aim to split the Chinese nation.

    The other people who attended the meeting all have parents, brothers, and sisters in Taiwan. They said that when commemorating the tenth anniversary of the "February 28th" Uprising, they especially miss their relatives who are suffering in Taiwan and hate the crimes of American imperialism in occupying Taiwan by force. They expressed their determination to inherit the glorious tradition of "February 28th" and vowed not to give up until their hometowns are liberated.
