On the Identification of Leaders
Wan Song

The Eighth National Congress of the Party taught us to raise our level of Marxist-Leninist consciousness, to be good at identifying correct and incorrect opinions, and to be good at identifying good and bad leaders, so as to improve our ability to work.

Usually, we have many opinions about each leader, but it is difficult to truly identify whether a leader is good or bad. My own ability in this area is not high. However, one experience is worth talking about.

Many years ago, I worked in an organization. Our "immediate boss" was a very old cadre; he was very enthusiastic and did not put on airs with his subordinates. He spoke a lot and was very kind. Subordinates could talk about anything in front of him, complain, or make requests regarding working conditions, such as supplementing cadres, adding funds, etc.; even personal life requests. This leader was always sympathetic to the complaints of his subordinates; he always generously said, "I can think of a way to solve it" for requests about conditions, and sometimes he readily promised to solve them. Therefore, subordinates were always filled with comfort and hope when they left him after a conversation. However, regarding the conditions, his reply was often sincere, saying, "I thought of a way, but the general situation is very difficult at the moment, and it is difficult to solve it for a while; let's see later." We knew that he had indeed actively thought of a way, but the general situation really did not allow it. Our hope was dashed, but we still felt warm inside. Because of this leader's enthusiasm and sincerity, we liked him very much and thought he was a good leader; we didn't think he had any shortcomings.

The style of another leader who was responsible for higher responsibilities was the opposite. He was very serious, so serious that he made people feel a bit cold; when we went to talk to him, he listened more and spoke less himself; he agreed with some of what we said, but added some, some were noncommittal, some probed to the bottom, and some were critical. This made us have to be very cautious when talking to him, to be prepared, systematic, and measured, and not to be casual. In particular, he would heavily criticize excessive complaining; he rejected more requests for working conditions than he allowed; but once allowed, it would be implemented soon.

We felt that this leader had advantages, being serious and conscientious, and keeping his word. But compared to the former one, we always felt that he was too cold and not concerned enough about his subordinates.

We respected both of them very much, but if we were to say who we liked, it was the former one.

However, after an incident, my understanding changed. The incident was like this: Once, I drafted a new work plan and proposed the conditions necessary to ensure the implementation of this plan. I sent the plan to the "immediate boss" first, and he thought the plan was very good and the conditions could all be approved, as long as the comrade who was responsible for higher responsibilities agreed. A week later, the comrade who was responsible for higher responsibilities asked me to talk to him. After asking me to answer many questions about the plan, he said, "We have no experience in this matter, and the plan is not approved for the time being; but you can try it out; the conditions you proposed, I will give you some," cutting it in half. I was a little discouraged, but dared not argue, so I had to rely on the given conditions and try to do it. Naturally, there were many difficulties, but thanks to the efforts of the comrades who participated in this work together, we finally managed to get a glimpse of the results. Three months later, the comrade who was responsible for higher responsibilities asked us to hold a meeting to summarize the results of the trial plan; he and our "immediate boss" both came to participate. After listening to our summary report, he affirmed the achievements and also criticized the shortcomings. The "immediate boss" gave us a great deal of encouragement. Three days later, the original plan was suddenly formally approved, the funding was given according to the original budget, and there were even two more cadres than we had originally requested. This was really a pleasant surprise for us. At that meeting, we did not propose a request to approve the original plan, because, in the three months of work, we already felt that the halved working conditions could barely support the work.

After this incident, and after analyzing many other things, I found the leader who was responsible for higher responsibilities very lovable. I think his style has good things in it; first of all, it is seeking truth from facts, and also the principles and initiative in dealing with problems. He does not regard working conditions as something to comfort cadres; nor does he regard it as something that can be bargained, if it should not be given, complaining will not give it, and arguing will not give it, and he will even criticize; if it should be given, it will be given without waiting for the subordinates to make a request. He is different from individual posturing, cold and mean bureaucrats.

With the change in my understanding of him, my views on the "immediate boss" also changed. Naturally, I think the "immediate boss" is still a good leader, but he made a mistake, which is what Lao Tzu said, "Easy promises are rarely kept, and taking many things lightly will surely lead to many difficulties." He has more than enough enthusiasm for cadres, but he does not understand and research the overall situation enough, so he often issues "empty checks." This style of his can only give cadres comfort, but it has little educational significance for cadres. However, he is sincere, unlike individual perfunctory bureaucrats who deceive cadres to gain their favor. If we are to say that there is a bit of bureaucracy in his style, then perhaps it is some people's "sincere bureaucracy."

In the rectification campaign, we will conduct another round of identification of leaders. We often remember Confucius's maxim, to identify people we must "listen to their words and observe their actions." But the same listening and observation, due to the different levels of consciousness and different standards, lead to different conclusions. For example, if we ourselves only demand enthusiasm and generosity from leaders, and although repeatedly disappointed by "empty checks," we continue to place hope, then we will always feel that the "immediate boss" is particularly good. And in this way, we ourselves fall into subjective one-sidedness.

    对于领导者的识别
    万松
    党的八次代表大会教导我们要提高马克思列宁主义的觉悟水平，善于识别正确的意见和错误的意见，善于识别好的领导者和坏的领导者，这才能提高自己的工作能力。
    通常，我们对每个领导者的这样和那样的看法是不少的，但要真正识别领导者的好坏，却是一件难事。我自己在这方面的能力不高。但是，有一条经历，却是值得谈一谈的。
    多年前，我曾经在一个机关里工作。我们的“顶头上司”是一个很老的干部；他很热情，对下级不摆架子，话说得很多，很亲切。下级在他面前，可以无话不谈，也可以诉苦，可以提出关于工作条件的要求，如补充干部啦，追加经费啦……等等；甚至于个人生活方面的要求。这位领导者，对于下级的诉苦，总是同情的；对于条件的要求，也总是慷慨地说：“可以想想办法看”，有时还满口答应解决。因此，下级从他那里谈话出来的时候，心里总是充满了安慰和希望。然而，关于条件，后来他的答复，十有七、八，总是诚恳地说：“我想过办法了，但是目前总的情况很困难，一时难以解决；以后再看罢。”我们知道，他实在是积极想了办法的，的确是总的情况不允许。我们的希望是落空了，但心里还是温暖的。由于这位领导者的热情和诚恳，我们很喜欢他，认为他是很好的一个领导者；我们不觉得他有什么缺点。
    另一个负更高责任的领导者的作风，恰恰相反。他很严肃，严肃到使人觉得有点冷；我们去同他谈话，他听的时间多，自己说得少；他对于我们所说的，有的表示同意，但补充一些，有的不置可否，有的寻根究底，有的则提出批评。这样，就使得我们对他说话必须十分谨慎，要经过准备，有系统，有分寸，不敢随便。特别是，诉苦诉多了，他要大加批评；对于工作条件的要求，他拒绝的多，允许的少；但一经允许，不久就给实现。
    我们觉得，这位领导者有好处，严肃认真，言而有信。但比起前面所说的那一位来，我们总是觉得他太冷，对下级不够关心。
    对于这两位，我们都很尊重，但要说喜欢，那么是在前一位。
    然而，在经历了一回事情之后，我的认识起了变化了。事情是这样的：有一回，我拟了一个新的工作计划，并提出了保证这计划实现所需的条件。我把计划先送给那位“顶头上司”，他看了认为计划很好，条件也全可批准，只要那位负更高责任的同志同意。过了一个星期，负更高责任的同志找我去谈话，在对计划提出好些问题让我解答以后，他说：“这事我们没有经验，计划暂不批准；但你们可以去试试看；所提条件，给你某些某些”，打了一个对折。我很有点泄气，但不敢争，只好凭着所给的条件，试着做起来。困难自然很多，但靠了共同参加这工作的同志们的努力，总算试出一点眉目来了。过了三个月，那位负更高责任的同志要我们开一个会，把试行计划的结果总结一下；他和我们的“顶头上司”都来参加。在听了我们的总结汇报以后，他肯定了成绩，也批评了缺点。“顶头上司”则大大地给了我们一番鼓舞。过了三天，忽然原来的计划被正式批准了，经费也按原预算照给，干部还比我们原来所要求的多了两个。这在我们，实在是喜出望外。在那个会议上，我们是并没有提出批准原方案的要求的，因为，在三个月的工作中，我们已经觉得那个打了对折的工作条件，是可以勉强支持工作的。
    经过这回事，又分析了其他许多事情，我对于那位负更高责任的领导者，觉得非常可爱起来。我认为他的作风，有很好的东西在里面；首先是实事求是，还有是处理问题的原则性和主动精神。他不把工作条件看成是安慰干部的东西；也不把它看成是可以讨价还价的事情，不该给，诉苦也不给，闹也不给，还要批评；该给，不待下级提出要求就给。他不同于个别的装腔作势、冷淡刻薄的官僚主义者。
    对他的认识一变化，同时对那“顶头上司”的看法也有所不同了。自然，我觉得“顶头上司”还是一位好的领导者，但他犯了一个毛病，就是老子所说的“轻诺必寡信、多易必多难。”他对干部的热情有余，但对全面情况的了解研究却是不足的，所以常常开“空头支票”。他这种作风，只能给干部以安慰，但对于干部的教育意义是很少的。不过，他是诚恳的，不同于个别假意敷衍、骗取干部的好感的官僚主义者。如果，要说他的作风里面也有点官僚主义，那么，也许就是有些人们说的“诚诚恳恳的官僚主义”罢。
    在整风中，我们对于领导者，又要进行一番识别了。我们常常记得孔子的格言，识别人要“听其言而观其行”。但同样的听和观，由于觉悟水平的不同，标准的不同，各人得出的结论是不同的。例如，我们自己要要求于领导者的倘若只是热情和慷慨，对“空头支票”虽然屡次失望而又不断寄托希望，那么，我们始终会觉得那位“顶头上司”是特别地好的。而这样，我们自己就陷入主观片面性。
