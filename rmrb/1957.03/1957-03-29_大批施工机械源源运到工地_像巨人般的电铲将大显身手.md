Xinhua News Agency, Sanmenxia, 28th. Two Soviet-produced "Ural Giant" four-cubic-meter electric shovels have arrived at Huixingzhen Station and will soon participate in the construction of the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station project. These two "giants" arrived on six and a half train cars. The largest component of the giant weighs 37.9 tons. Each of these electric shovels can excavate 20,000 to 30,000 cubic meters of earth per month. Also arriving were three electric shovels with a capacity of three cubic meters each.

The person in charge of the Materials Supply Department of the Sanmenxia Yellow River Engineering Bureau said: Recently, fourteen train cars fully loaded with machinery, equipment, and various materials have been arriving here every day.

The total number of mechanical equipment required for the construction of the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station project is more than 7,000 units (sets). Currently, 1,500 units (sets) have been transported to the work area. Some motors, bulldozers, air compressors, etc., have been transported to the construction site, some are being installed, and some have already been started. Various machines and materials are piled up at the Huixing Station in Sanmenxia and in the temporary warehouse yard with an area of more than 43,000 square meters.

Domestic heavy machinery industrial production departments are also serving the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station project. Twenty-four large and medium-sized cities across the country, including Qiqihar in the Northeast and Guiyang in the remote Southwest, have factories that have signed contracts with the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau to supply Sanmenxia Engineering with various mechanical equipment for water, electricity, and wind supply. The 250 lathes and forging equipment used by the Sanmenxia project's auxiliary enterprises will also be supplied by them. Currently, one-cubic-meter electric shovels produced by Fushun Heavy Machinery Factory, 45-ton large cranes produced by Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, and various new machines such as winches produced by Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory can already be seen in warehouses and construction sites.

In addition to ordering goods from the Soviet Union, the Engineering Bureau has also placed orders with Czechoslovakia, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Japan, and other countries. Twenty self-unloading trucks with a load capacity of ten tons imported from Czechoslovakia are already in use at the construction site. (Attached picture)

　　大批施工机械源源运到工地
　　像巨人般的电铲将大显身手
    新华社三门峡28日电  两个苏联出产的“乌拉尔巨人”—四立方电铲，已经到达了会兴镇车站，即将参加三门峡水电站工程的施工。这两个“巨人”来时坐了六个半车皮。巨人的最大的一个部件就重三十七吨九。这种电铲每部每月可挖两三万石方。同时来到的还有三部容量三立方公尺的电铲。
    黄河三门峡工程局物资供应处的负责人说：最近一个时期，每天都有十四个满载机械设备和各种器材的车皮来到这里。
    三门峡水电站工程施工所需的全部机械装备，数量达七千多台（套）。目前已有一千五百台（套）运到了工区，有一部分电动机、推土机、空气压缩机等已经运到工地，有的正在安装，有的已经开动。三门峡会兴车站上和四万三千多平方公尺面积的临时仓库场地上，都摆满了各种机械和器材。
    国内的重型机械工业生产部门也在为三门峡水电站工程服务。全国有二十四个大、中城市，包括东北的齐齐哈尔和西南边远的贵阳，都有工厂和三门峡工程局订立合同，他们将供给三门峡工程各种供水、供电、供风等机械设备。三门峡工程的辅属企业所使用的二百五十台车床和锻压设备，也由他们供给。目前在仓库和工地上，已经可以看到抚顺重型机械厂出产的一立方的电铲，大连机车车辆厂出产的四十五吨大吊车和贵阳矿山机械厂出产的卷扬机等各种崭新的机械。
    另外，工程局除向苏联订货外，还向捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、德意志民主共和国、日本等国家订了货，从捷克斯洛伐克进口的二十辆载重十吨的自卸卡车，已经在工地上使用。（附图片）
