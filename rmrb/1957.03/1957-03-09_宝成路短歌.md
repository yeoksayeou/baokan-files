    Along the road the Red Army walked
    　　I
    In the depths of those mountains,
    Stands a memorial archway,
    Surrounded tightly by miscellaneous trees,
    Wildflowers bloom all around.
    Although the years have been long,
    The slogan on it still shines brightly,
    The red characters of "Realize the National Soviet,"
    Prove that the Red Army came to this place.
    　　II
    Railway surveying team members,
    Enter this hilly area with miscellaneous trees,
    Theodolites set up on the hillside,
    Searching for the best route for the train.
    After surveying for several days,
    Finally, they aimed the lens at the archway,
    Under the slogan written by the Red Army,
    They drove down the line marker.
    　　III
    Surveying team members followed the path carved out by the Red Army,
    Climbing high mountains and singing,
    Their heroic figures,
    Remind people of the Red Army's strength in those years.
    "The spirit of the Red Army's Long March,
    Has increased our strength to struggle against difficulties,
    The small mountain path carved out by the Red Army in those years,
    We must flatten it,
    To let the train come and go."

    On the ancient plank road
    In the depths of the Daba Mountains,
    On the waist of the cliff,
    On the ancient plank road,
    New China's train is running.
    This is not a legend in mythology,
    Nor is it an artist's fabrication,
    This is the reality of our New China—
    The credit of the mountain-opening heroes.

    On the green river surface below the mountain,
    The first reflection of a train galloping by appears,
    The white clouds and ancient pines on the top of the mountain,
    Hear the roar of the train for the first time,
    The eagle gathering on the mountain top,
    Also flaps its wings in panic and flies into the clouds.
    O eagle! Fly with the mountain wind!
    Fly! Take the roar of the train with you,
    And also the laughter of the road-building workers,
    Fly over the mountains, fly to all directions,
    And tell the world about the changes in this deep mountain.

    宝成路短歌
    雁翼
    沿着红军走过的道路	一
    在那群山的深处，
    树立着一座牌坊，
    杂树紧紧把它包围，
    野花在四周开放。
    虽然年月已久，
    上面的标语仍放着光芒，
    “实现全国苏维埃”的红字，
    证明红军到过这个地方。	二
    铁路测量队员们，
    走进这杂树丛丛的山岗，
    经纬仪架在山坡，
    给列车寻找最好的路线。
    测量了几天的结果，
    最后把镜子对准了牌坊，
    在红军写的标语下面，
    打下了线路的标桩。	三
    测量队员沿着红军踩出的小道，
    登上高山歌唱，
    他们那英雄的身影，
    使人想起当年红军的坚强。
    “红军长征的精神，
    增长了我们向困难斗争的力量，
    红军当年踩出的群山小道，
    我们要把它劈平，
    让火车来往。”
    在古时候的栈道上
    在大巴群山的深处，
    在绝壁的半腰，
    在古时候的栈道上，
    有新中国的列车奔跑。
    这不是神话中的传奇，
    也不是艺术家的捏造，
    这是我们新中国的现实——
    开山勇士们的功劳。
    山下碧绿的江面上，
    第一次映下火车奔驰之景，
    山顶上的白云和古松，
    第一次听见火车的吼叫，
    那聚息在山头上的雄鹰，
    也惊慌地展翅飞进云霄。
    雄鹰呵！你拍着山风飞吧！
    飞吧！带上列车的吼鸣，
    也带上筑路工人的欢笑，
    飞过群山，飞向四方，
    把这深山的变化告诉全世界知道。
