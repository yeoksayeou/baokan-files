    Overseas Chinese Love Their Motherland - Ye Heting's Speech
    I am a representative of overseas Chinese from India. Once a year, I travel thousands of miles to collect the opinions of overseas Chinese and come to the capital of the motherland to gather with everyone, offer opinions, and discuss national affairs. This fact itself demonstrates the inseparable connection between overseas Chinese and the motherland, and also proves the great policy of the People's Government to safeguard the interests of overseas Chinese, respect their opinions, and unite overseas compatriots to build a socialist motherland.
    In his report on his visit to eleven Asian and European countries, Premier Zhou Enlai, after describing his visit to seven nationalistic countries in Asia, mentioned that most of these countries have a considerable number of overseas Chinese, who welcomed relatives from the motherland with extremely strong feelings. In the past, they were exploited and oppressed by colonialism, just like the people of their countries of residence. Now, the achievements of the People's Republic of China in all aspects make them feel happy and honored. Premier Zhou's words have summarized the situation of overseas Chinese in various parts of Asia. We overseas Chinese, who used to call ourselves orphans abroad, are now completely different. The establishment of New China and its increasing prosperity and strength have greatly changed the status of overseas Chinese and their relationship with the motherland. Therefore, I would now like to talk about the current situation of overseas Chinese from three aspects:
    (1) Overseas Chinese love the motherland and firmly support the socialist construction of the motherland. Today, the great achievements of the new motherland in all aspects and the improvement of its international reputation make overseas Chinese feel honored and happy. It has further inspired the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese. Since liberation, taking our overseas Chinese in India as an example, many people have returned to visit every year. They have seen the rapid development of the motherland and understood the government's policies to protect the interests of overseas Chinese in all aspects. Many people have changed from doubt and misunderstanding to trust and love for the People's Government. Today, the vast majority of overseas Chinese are willing to support the socialist construction of the motherland with manpower, material resources, and spirit. Under the call of the banner of patriotism, the united front of overseas Chinese patriotism has become increasingly consolidated and strengthened.
    (2) Overseas Chinese firmly support the government's policy of peaceful liberation of Taiwan and are willing to contribute their efforts to strive for the early peaceful liberation of Taiwan. At the third session of the First National People's Congress last year, Premier Zhou pointed out in his report on international issues and the peaceful liberation of Taiwan: We attach importance to the active role played by the vast number of patriotic overseas Chinese in promoting the cause of peaceful liberation of Taiwan, and hope that the small number of overseas Chinese who are still opposed to the motherland will stand with the vast number of patriotic overseas Chinese and contribute to the patriotic cause of promoting the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. I believe that the vast number of patriotic overseas Chinese are particularly eager for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. They hope to see the unity of the nation and the integrity of the territory of the motherland as soon as possible. Therefore, in the work of striving for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, the vast number of patriotic overseas Chinese are willing to contribute their efforts, and, based on the principles of "patriotism is one family" and "patriotism is not divided into early and late," unite more overseas Chinese through persuasion and strive to give full play to the strength of overseas Chinese and assist the government in striving for the early peaceful liberation of Taiwan.
    (3) Overseas Chinese actively support the country's peaceful foreign policy abroad. I live in India. Since Premier Zhou and Indian Prime Minister Nehru issued the world-renowned Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, cultural and economic exchanges between China and India have been increasing, and the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people has been deepening. We overseas Chinese living in India have a particularly deep understanding. We deeply appreciate the great spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. When Premier Zhou visited Calcutta, India, he called on the local overseas Chinese to learn from Xuanzang, learn the language of the country of residence, and encouraged us to respect the laws, lives, and customs of the country of residence. In the future, we will further follow the motherland's peaceful foreign policy and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, carry forward the precious historical friendship with the people of our countries of residence, promote our cultural exchanges and economic cooperation with the people of our countries of residence, and strive for the friendship and peace of the people of Asian countries.

    海外华侨热爱祖国  叶鹤汀的发言
    我是一个印度的华侨代表，我一年一次的不远千里地搜集了华侨的意见来到祖国的首都和大家共聚一堂，提供意见，商讨国家大事。这件事实的本身就说明了华侨与祖国的不可分割，同时也证明了人民政府维护华侨利益，尊重华侨意见，团结海外侨胞建设社会主义祖国的伟大政策。
    周恩来总理在关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告中，在他叙述了访问亚洲七个民族主义国家后，曾接着提到说，大部分这些国家里都有相当数量的华侨，他们都以极其强烈的感情来欢迎祖国去的亲人，他们过去同侨居国人民一样受到殖民主义的剥削和压迫。现在，中华人民共和国的各方面的成就使他们感到高兴和光荣。周总理的话已经概括了亚洲各地的华侨的情况。华侨，我们过去自称为海外孤儿，今天却截然不同，新中国的成立和它的日益繁荣富强，使海外的华侨的地位和祖国的关系也发生了很大的变化。因此，我现在从三方面来谈谈目前华侨的情况：
    （一）华侨是热爱祖国，坚决拥护祖国社会主义建设的。今天，新生的祖国在各方面的伟大成就，国际声誉的提高，使华侨感到光荣和高兴。更加鼓舞了华侨的爱国热情。解放以来，就拿我们印度的华侨来讲，每年有很多人回来观光，他们看到了祖国一日千里的建设，了解了政府在各方面保护华侨利益的政策，许多人都从怀疑、不了解到信任和热爱人民政府。今天绝大多数的华侨都愿意从人力、物力和精神上来支持祖国的社会主义建设，在爱国主义旗帜的感召下，华侨爱国统一阵线已日益巩固和壮大。
    （二）华侨坚决拥护政府和平解放台湾的政策，并愿意贡献出力量来争取早日和平解放台湾。去年第一届人民代表大会第三次会议上，周总理在有关国际问题及和平解放台湾的问题的报告中曾指出：我们重视海外广大的爱国侨胞在推动和平解放台湾事业中所发挥的积极作用，并希望少数还对祖国采取对立的侨胞与广大的爱国侨胞站在一边，为促进和平解放台湾的爱国事业作出贡献。我认为，海外的广大的爱国侨胞对于和平解放台湾的心情是特别迫切的。他们希望早日看见祖国民族的团结和领土的完整。因此，在争取和平解放台湾的工作中，广大的爱国的侨胞都愿意贡献出力量，“本着爱国一家”“爱国不分先后”的原则经过说服、争取，团结了更多的华侨，发挥华侨的力量，协助政府争取早日和平解放台湾。
    （三）华侨在国外积极地拥护国家的和平外交政策。我是住在印度的，自从周总理和印度尼赫鲁总理发表了举世闻名的和平共处的五项原则后，中印间的文化、经济交流已日益增加，中印人民的友谊也日益深厚，我们旅居印度的华侨体会得特别深刻。我们都深深地体会到和平共处五项原则的伟大精神。周总理这次访问印度加尔各答时曾号召当地华侨人人学玄奘，学习所在国的语言，并勉励我们尊重所在国的法律、生活和习惯。我们今后将更加遵循祖国的和平外交政策及和平共处的五项原则，发扬光大与侨居国人民宝贵的历史友谊，促进我们与侨居国人民文化交流与经济合作，为亚洲各国人民的友谊与和平而努力。
