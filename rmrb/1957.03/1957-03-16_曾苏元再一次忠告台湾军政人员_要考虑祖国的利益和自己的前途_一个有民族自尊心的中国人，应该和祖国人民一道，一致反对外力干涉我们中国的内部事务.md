    I fully support Chairman Zhou Enlai's report on his visit to eleven Asian and European countries; I fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
    Before the opening of the meeting, I personally heard Chairman Mao's important instructions at the Supreme State Council on the correct handling of contradictions among the people. This earnest teaching not only made me feel very excited, but also felt extremely cordial.
    1956 was a year of great changes in both the international and domestic situations. In this year, the advancement of the socialist cause has greatly educated and encouraged us. I would like to make the following statement to the conference regarding some of my own situations and opinions:
    After conducting inspection work last year, I and fifteen people, including Jiangsu Provincial People's Representatives, CPPCC members, and counselors from the Provincial Counselor's Office, who went to the countryside to inspect work, stayed in the "Dongfanghong" and "Dengta" agricultural production cooperatives in Yancheng County, Jiangsu, with the approval of the leadership, to experience life. After a period of time, I gained a further understanding of the rapidly changing rural landscape and the superiority of the socialist system.
    Before we participated in this rural life observation and practice, although we had already realized that after the land system reform after liberation, rural productivity was liberated, and the rural landscape had undergone fundamental changes, our understanding of the profound changes in the rural landscape and the superiority of the socialist system after the high tide of agricultural socialist transformation was still not deep enough. We lived in the "Dongfanghong" and "Dengta" advanced cooperatives for forty-two days, and the situation was different. Everyone saw with their own eyes that the farmers' enthusiasm for labor was generally high after the establishment of the advanced cooperatives, and the countryside was full of new atmosphere, everyone was energetic and worked diligently. Everyone also saw with their own eyes that the advanced cooperatives were truly "making the best use of the land, making the best use of people's talents, providing for the elderly, and educating the young." This new scene cannot be compared with the desolate scene of the countryside in old China and the situation where farmers lived like cattle and horses. Even the poem written by the ancients, "Working in the fields during the day and spinning hemp at night, the village children are in charge of their own families, and the grandchildren who do not understand farming and weaving also learn to plant melons by the mulberry shade," which depicts the beautiful scene of the countryside in feudal society, cannot be used to compare with today's countryside. Because today's rural scene is indeed much more beautiful and richer in content than him. I deeply felt that although the living standards of farmers are not high at present, they are gradually getting rid of poverty and backwardness and seeing their prosperous and happy future. Such a rural scene really moved me and educated me extremely deeply, making me feel more and more that socialism is lovely. The "Eighth National Congress" documents pointed out that the future construction policy is to prioritize the development of heavy industry, while actively developing light industry, and also vigorously develop agriculture. Under such a construction policy, the countryside will be more prosperous in the future, the lives of farmers will be happier, and the worker-peasant alliance will be more consolidated.
    Now I will talk about the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Premier Zhou Enlai, in his political report at the last meeting, on behalf of the government, put forward the call to strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. At this meeting, Premier Zhou also talked about this issue. Undoubtedly, taking peaceful means to liberate Taiwan is the government's consistent call, which not only conforms to the interests of the Chinese people, including the people of Taiwan, not only conforms to the interests of Asian peace and world peace, but also truly points out a bright road for the military and government personnel of the Kuomintang. Our proposal for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan does not mean weakness, but for the sake of national interests and for the sake of peace. The government has repeatedly stated: Patriotism makes us one family, patriotism has no order of precedence, as long as we take the road of patriotism, the past can be forgiven. Moreover, it is said that if there are any doubts, you can go back to the mainland to visit and learn from relatives and friends. The government guarantees freedom of movement and allows free communication. Does this not show the government's greatest sincerity? Here, I want to once again advise the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan to recognize the general trend and consider the interests of the motherland and their own future. Do not be superstitious that relying on foreign forces, the remaining situation in Taiwan can still be promising. In fact, relying on foreign forces has never had a good result in Chinese and foreign history. Relying on the United States is even more like seeking skin from a tiger. I believe that a Chinese with national self-esteem should stand with the people of the motherland, should unanimously oppose American aggression, and unanimously oppose foreign interference in our internal affairs of China. The people of Taiwan and the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan should strive to get rid of American control and enslavement under the premise of loving the motherland and opposing aggression, and resolutely stand under the banner of patriotism together with the people of the motherland. Taiwan is an inalienable territory of China, and the people of Taiwan are compatriots of China. The people of the motherland are extremely sympathetic to the painful life of the people of Taiwan and the Kuomintang military, government, and public educators under American enslavement. Striving for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan is the best way for them to get rid of suffering and save themselves and others. We hope that they will get rid of the sea of ​​suffering as soon as possible and return to the warm embrace of the motherland.
    Finally, I would also like to express my gratitude to the Party and the government for their help and care in my work and life.
    After last autumn, I went to work at the Jiangsu Provincial Forestry Department. At the beginning, due to my unfamiliarity with the business, I inevitably had some concerns in my mind. However, with the enthusiastic help of the Party member Deputy Director and other comrades, I gradually became familiar with the business and felt very happy at work. In life, I feel more and more happy. My children are working hard in their jobs, and my grandchildren are studying hard in school. Under the influence of socialist ideological education, their mental outlook has also undergone fundamental changes. They are gradually growing the socialist moral qualities, and family life is even more cordial and lovely, which makes me feel that living in such a society, I am younger and happier. In the future, I will work better and study better to thank the Party and the government for their trust and honor.

    曾苏元再一次忠告台湾军政人员
    要考虑祖国的利益和自己的前途
    一个有民族自尊心的中国人，应该和祖国人民一道，一致反对外力干涉我们中国的内部事务
    我完全拥护周恩来主席关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告；我完全同意陈叔通副主席中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告。
    会议开幕之前，我曾亲自听到毛主席在最高国务会议上关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的重要指示。这一谆谆教诲，不仅使我感到非常兴奋，并且还感到无比亲切。
    1956年，国际和国内形势都是有了很大变化的一年。在这一年中，社会主义事业的前进，使我们受到了很大的教育和鼓舞。谨把我自己一些情况和意见，向大会作如下的发言：
    去年进行视察工作以后，我和一起到农村视察工作的江苏省人民代表、政协委员和省参事室参事共十五人，经领导上的同意，留在江苏盐城县“东方红”、“灯塔”两个农业生产合作社体验生活，经过了一段时期，使我对瞬息变化着的农村面貌和社会主义制度的优越性，有了进一步的认识。
    在我们没有参加这次农村生活的观察和实践以前，虽然已经认识到：解放后经过土地制度的改革，解放了农村生产力，农村面貌有了根本的变化，但是对农业社会主义改造高潮后农村面貌的深刻变化和社会主义制度的优越性，认识还是不深的。我们在“东方红”、“灯塔”两个高级社住了四十二天，情况就不同了。大家亲眼看到农民在成立高级社以后，劳动热情普遍高涨，农村里是一片新兴气象，人人都精神焕发，勤劳生产。大家又亲眼看到高级社里真是“地尽其利，人尽其才，老有所养，幼有所教”。这一片新的景象和旧中国农村一片荒凉、农民过着牛马生活的情况是无法比拟的。就拿古人所写“昼出耘田夜绩麻，村庄儿女各当家，童孙未解供耕织，也傍桑阴学种瓜。”这首描绘封建社会农村的美丽景象的诗来说，却也远不能以此来比拟今天的农村了。因为今天的农村景象，实在比他美丽得多，内容丰富得多。我深深地感觉到：虽然目前农民生活水平还不高，但是他们已经逐步地在摆脱贫穷落后的境地，看到了自己的繁荣幸福的未来。这样的农村景象，的确使我万分感动，极其深刻地教育了我，使我更觉得社会主义的可爱。在“八大”文件中指出今后建设的方针在优先发展重工业的同时，除积极地发展轻工业外，还须大力发展农业。在这样的建设方针下，今后农村将会更加繁荣，农民生活将会更加幸福，工农联盟将会更加巩固。
    现在我谈谈和平解放台湾问题。周恩来总理在上次会议上做政治报告时，曾代表政府提出了争取和平解放台湾的号召。在这次会议上，周总理又谈到这个问题。无疑地采取和平方式解放台湾，这是政府一贯的号召，不仅符合中国人民包括台湾人民的利益，不仅符合亚洲和平和世界和平的利益，而且也是真正为国民党的军政人员指出了一条光明大道。我们提出和平解放台湾，并非表示软弱，而是为了民族利益，为了和平利益。政府一再表示：爱国便是一家，爱国并无先后，只要走爱国道路，既往都可以不咎。而且表示如有疑虑，可以回大陆参观，向亲友了解，政府保证来去自由，允许自由通信，这不是表明了政府的最大诚意吗？在这里，我要再一次忠告在台湾的国民党军政人员，要认清大势，要考虑祖国的利益和自己的前途。不要再迷信以为依恃外国势力，台湾残局尚有可为。其实，依恃外国势力，在中外历史上都没有一个有好结果的，指靠美国，更是与虎谋皮。我认为：一个有民族自尊心的中国人，应该和祖国人民站在一道，应该一致反对美国的侵略，一致反对外力干涉我们中国的内部事务。台湾人民和在台湾的国民党军政人员应该在热爱祖国反对侵略的前提下，力争摆脱美国的控制和奴役，坚决地和祖国人民一道站在爱国主义的旗帜之下。台湾是中国不可分割的领土，台湾人民是中国的同胞。祖国人民对目前台湾人民和国民党军政公教人员在美国奴役下的痛苦生活是极其同情的。争取和平解放台湾，正是他们解脱痛苦、自救救人的最好方法，我们希望他们早日脱离苦海，回到温暖的祖国怀抱里来。
    最后，我还要对党和政府给我工作上、生活上的帮助和关怀，表示感谢。
    去年秋后，我到了江苏省林业厅工作，开始的时候，由于对业务不熟悉，思想上不免有些顾虑。但在党员副厅长和其他同志给我同志式的热情帮助下，使我逐渐地熟悉了业务，在工作中感到非常愉快。在生活上，我觉得愈过愈幸福了。儿女们都在工作岗位努力工作，孙儿们都在学校里努力学习。他们在社会主义思想教育的影响之下，精神面貌也起了根本的变化。他们都逐渐地成长着社会主义的道德品质，家庭生活更是显得亲切可爱，从而使我感到生在这样的社会里，自己更年青了、更幸福了。今后我要更好地工作，更好地学习，来答谢党和政府给我的信任和荣誉。
