Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 11th: Lieutenant Colonel Balian, Commander of the Indonesian Second Military Region, announced on the 9th the takeover of political power in South Sumatra Province and Jambi State, and the establishment of a military government.

According to Jakarta's "People's Daily", prior to Balian's separatist action, the "Eagle Revolutionary Committee" in South Sumatra, which opposes the central government, and representatives of the Masyumi Party and Socialist Party held a meeting on March 6th and signed a "charter" for separatist action. This "charter" demanded the establishment of a military government in South Sumatra, the "restoration of the Sukarno-Hatta dual leadership," and the establishment of a "Federal Council" of the parliament.

Today's "Independent" newspaper commented on the Second Military Region Commander Balian's takeover of power in South Sumatra and Jambi, stating that the South Sumatra incident shows that some politicians, unable to resolve problems through political struggle, rely on the military to seize power and position.

Jakarta's "People's Daily" said today that the adventurous actions of the South Sumatra incident contain the "smell of petroleum" and that this matter is related to foreign imperialism.

Colonel Dahlan Jambek, the representative of the Indonesian Army Chief of Staff, arrived in Palembang on the morning of March 10th. He will inquire with Second Military Region Commander Balian about the establishment of a military government in South Sumatra.

    印度尼西亚第二军区司令
    窃夺南苏门答腊和占碑政权
    据新华社雅加达11日电　印度尼西亚第二军区司令巴利安中校9日宣布接收南苏门答腊省和占碑州的政权，并且成立了军政府。
    据雅加达“人民日报”报道，在巴利安采取这一分裂行动以前，南苏门答腊的反对中央政府的“鹰革命委员会”和马斯友美党、社会党的代表曾经在3月6日举行会议，并且签署了一个采取分裂行动的“约章”。这个“约章”要求在南苏门答腊成立军政府，“恢复苏加诺和哈达的二位一体”，并且成立国会的“联邦院”。
    今天的“独立报”评论第二军区司令巴利安接管南苏门答腊和占碑的政权事件说，南苏门答腊事件表明，一些政治家由于在政治斗争中不能解决问题，就依靠军人来夺取政权和地位。
    雅加达的“人民日报”今天说，南苏门答腊事件的冒险行动含有“石油气味”，这件事和外国帝国主义是有关系的。
    印度尼西亚陆军参谋长的代表达兰·贾姆贝克上校已经在3月10日上午到达巨港。他将向第二军区司令巴利安询问关于南苏门答腊成立军政府的问题。
