After Watching the Performance of Bulgarian Artists
	Xiao Qing
	I am honored to see the performance of the Bulgarian artists again. When they visited the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and passed through Beijing, we were celebrating the New Year, and they took time out of their rest to perform three shows for us. Now, they have come to Beijing for a formal performance visit. Their performances deeply attract the audience in our capital. The "Devil's Trill" by Italian composer Tartini, performed by Professor Li. Sulusun, a violin professor at the Sofia National Academy of Music in Bulgaria, is a very difficult piece to play. Professor Sulusun's performance shows extremely high skills. In his performance of the Bulgarian Rhapsody "Vardar" composed by Pan. Vlajigerov, he showed different styles and performance techniques.
	The piano soloist Ka. Kazantsieva, a pianist with gray hair, played a newly practiced Chinese children's piano piece, which brought the audience back to the innocent and lively childhood with the sound of her piano. When she played the last two notes with childish mischievous fingers, the audience applauded warmly and asked her to play it again.
	Soprano Li. Anastasova is an actress from the Varna Opera House in Bulgaria. She won the Dimitrov Prize for her successful role as Tatyana in "Eugene Onegin". She sang the aria from the famous Italian composer Puccini's "Madame Butterfly" and the aria of Leonora from Verdi's opera "Il Trovatore". The latter describes a noble girl falling in love with a wandering singer. The girl hadn't seen the singer for a long time. One night, she heard the singer's beautiful singing from afar again. The girl knew that the singer still loved her sincerely. Her love was so strong that she would rather die if she couldn't be with him. Anastasova sang Leonora's inner joy with a clear and bright tone, fully demonstrating the maturity of her skills in the fast-paced section, and singing crisply and pleasantly in the ornamental passages. She also sang the Chinese song "Spinning Cotton" in Chinese. Her pronunciation was clear and accurate, and she was warmly welcomed by the audience.
	Bass singer Ji. Kezhuharov sang Mussorgsky's famous work "Song of the Flea" very well, creating an arrogant, self-righteous, and drunken image. He also sang two Chinese songs, "Eighteen Bends of the Yellow River" and "In That Faraway Place". His singing profoundly reflected the thoughts and feelings of the Chinese working people and their heroic spirit of not bowing to difficulties.
	The ballet was also a popular program. Li. Sulekova, an actress from the Sofia National Opera, gave a beautiful and moving impression with her performance of "The Dying Swan". The Soviet dance "Armenian Dance" performed by her and Si. Nedrijetev fully expresses the lively and humorous mood of the Armenians. Thank you to the Bulgarian artists for their beautiful performances for the audience in the capital, and I wish them good health! (Attached pictures)

    保加利亚艺术家演出观后
    晓青
    我荣幸地再次看到保加利亚艺术家们的表演。当他们访问越南民主共和国路过北京时，我们正欢度新年，他们曾抽出休息时间为我们演出三场。现在，他们是来到北京作正式的访问演出。他们的演出深深地吸引着我国首都的观众。保加利亚索非亚国家音乐学院小提琴教授列·苏卢松演奏的意大利作曲家塔尔蒂尼的名作“魔鬼的颤音”，是一首很难演奏的曲子，苏卢松教授的演奏，表现了极高的技巧。他在潘·符拉吉格罗夫作曲的保加利亚狂想曲“瓦尔达尔”的演奏中又表现了不同的风格和演奏手法。
    钢琴独奏家卡·卡赞慈叶娃，是一位头发已经花白的钢琴家，她演奏新练习的中国儿童钢琴曲，使观众跟随着她弹出的琴声回到了天真、活泼的儿童时代。当她用孩子般的调皮的手指弹完最后两个音时，观众以热烈的掌声请求她再弹一遍。
    女高音丽·阿纳斯塔索娃是保加利亚瓦尔宁歌剧院的演员，由于她成功地扮演了“叶夫根尼·奥涅金”中的塔齐亚娜，获得了季米特洛夫奖金。她演唱了意大利作曲家普西尼的名作“蝴蝶夫人”的咏叹调，和维尔第作曲的歌剧“行吟诗人”中的列奥·诺拉的咏叹调。后者是描写一个贵族姑娘爱上了一个流浪歌手。姑娘很久没有见到歌手。一天晚上，她又听到远远地传来的、歌手的动听的歌声。姑娘知道歌手还在真心地爱着她。她的爱情是那样的强烈，如果不能和他结合，就宁愿死去。阿纳斯塔索娃以明净清晰的音色唱出了列奥·诺拉的内心喜悦，在快速度的那一段中，充分表现了她技巧的成熟，在装饰乐段中也唱得清脆悦耳。她还用汉语演唱了中国歌曲“纺棉花”，她的吐字清晰，发音准确，受到了观众的热烈欢迎。
    男低音歌唱家季·科茹哈罗夫非常出色地演唱了莫索尔斯基的名作“跳蚤之歌”，他创造了一个狂妄自大的，醉汉般的形象。他还演唱了两首中国歌曲“天下黄河十八湾”和“在那遥远的地方”，他的歌声深刻地体现了中国劳动人民的思想感情和不向困难低头的英勇精神。
    受到观众欢迎的节目还有芭蕾舞。索非亚国家歌剧院演员莉·苏列柯娃表演的“天鹅之死”给人留下优美、动人的印象。她和斯·涅德里捷夫表演的苏联舞蹈“阿尔明尼亚舞”，充分地表现了阿尔明尼亚人活泼、风趣的情调。感谢保加利亚艺术家们给首都观众所作的如此优美的演出，并祝他们身体健康！（附图片）
