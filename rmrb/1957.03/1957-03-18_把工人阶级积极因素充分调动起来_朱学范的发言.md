    I fully agree with Chairman Mao's instructions on the correct handling of contradictions among the people and Premier Zhou's report on his visits abroad, and I fully agree with Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech on increasing production and practicing economy.
    I hold positions in the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. At today's meeting, I would like to express some opinions solely in my capacity as a trade union worker.
    Building socialism is the personal undertaking of the working class and the people of the whole country. The working class is the leading class in our country, and it bears a particularly important responsibility in the cause of building socialism. The working class is the main force in realizing socialist industrialization. To build socialism, it is necessary to mobilize and give play to all positive factors of the people of the whole country, and first of all, it is necessary to mobilize the positive factors of the working class. And the working class's own mass organization—the trade union—is playing a major role in this regard.
    In the first four years of the First Five-Year Plan, people from all walks of life across the country have made tremendous contributions in their respective posts, and the working class has demonstrated a high degree of initiative and creativity. The total industrial output value of the First Five-Year Plan has been completed one year ahead of schedule. The industrial production plans for the first two months of this year have also been completed very well. This active action of the national staff and workers has created favorable conditions for completing this year's tasks ahead of schedule and preparing for the Second Five-Year Plan.
    In the past year, the national trade union work, like the work on other fronts, has also made great achievements. To cite two more prominent examples: one is the advanced producer movement launched throughout the country last year, which has become a mass movement for the vast number of staff and workers to build socialism; the other is the trade union's assistance to the government in carrying out the national wage reform work, and it has also done a lot of other work related to the life and welfare of the staff and workers. These two tasks have played a significant role in bringing into play the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of staff and workers in building socialism.
    The central link of the advanced producer movement is the promotion of advanced experience. According to incomplete statistics from fourteen industries, including the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Second Ministry of Machine Building, textiles, coal mines, agriculture, forestry and water conservancy, electricity, posts and telecommunications, railways, highway transportation, light industry, petroleum, construction, and salt industry, 5,689 kinds of advanced experience were summarized and promoted in the first half of last year. These advanced experiences are of great significance for improving labor productivity. For example, after the advanced experience of the one-shift coal mining system was promoted in the coal mining industry last year, productivity increased by 20% to 25%. The spirit of research and creation among the broad masses of staff and workers in the advanced producer movement has risen to an unprecedented level, and the practice of putting forward rationalization proposals has become a common trend. According to statistics from the first half of 1956, staff and workers in various regions put forward more than 1.3 million rationalization proposals, which is equivalent to the total number of rationalization proposals in 1954 and 1955. Among the 450,000 rationalization proposals that have been implemented, those that can be calculated in value alone have created more than 256 million yuan of wealth for the country. The advanced producer movement has not only promoted the upsurge of the staff and workers in learning science and technology and advanced experience, but also promoted the improvement of enterprise management work accordingly.

    Deepen the Advanced Producer Movement
    This year, the national staff and workers must respond to the call of the Party and the government to carry out the work of increasing production and practicing economy, and must further deepen the advanced producer movement on the basis of what has already been achieved last year. Existing experience has proven that the advanced producer movement of the broad masses of staff and workers is the most effective method to fully utilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the staff and workers to achieve increased production and economy in industrial construction, transportation, and commercial work. To continue to deepen the advanced producer movement, we must continue to earnestly implement the principle of mutual learning, mutual assistance, learning from each other's strengths, and common improvement, and continue to vigorously promote effective advanced experience in a down-to-earth manner. In the advanced producer movement, on the one hand, we must pay attention to increasing the quantity of products and saving raw materials, materials, and fuel as much as possible according to the supply of raw materials, and at the same time, we must pay attention to improving the quality of products and pay attention to safe production. On the one hand, the trade union must mobilize the masses to think of every possible way to increase production and practice economy from all aspects, and at the same time, it must mobilize the masses to supervise the tendencies of those who one-sidedly only care about output, one-sidedly emphasize economy, and disregard quality and safety.

    Better Care for the Lives of Staff and Workers
    Under the Condition of Not Increasing National Expenditure
    Secondly, I would like to talk about the issue of caring for the lives of staff and workers. Gradually improving the lives of the masses on the basis of developing production is a consistent principle adhered to by the Communist Party and our government. After last year's wage reform, the increase in the average wage of national staff and workers has exceeded the target for the final year of the First Five-Year Plan in 1957. It should be affirmed that the wage reform work carried out nationwide last year was necessary and correct, and the achievements were great. Through wage reform, wage levels were raised, the wage system was improved, the lives of the staff and workers were improved, the labor enthusiasm of the staff and workers was boosted, and the relationship between the Party, the government, and the masses was further strengthened. In the past few years, the trade union had shortcomings in not paying enough attention to the lives of the staff and workers. These shortcomings have begun to be corrected last year. Of course, there were also many shortcomings in last year's wage reform work. For example, the wages of some staff and workers were raised too much, the upgrade range was too large, and some regulations and methods were not realistic. Because there was a relatively large increase in wages and benefits last year, and the country has certain difficulties in finance and material supply this year, the country will generally not increase the expenditure on wages and benefits this year. This is necessary. I heard someone say: "Last year was the year of improving life, and this year is the year of increasing production and practicing economy!" This view of opposing increasing production and practicing economy to improving life is wrong. Saving is necessary, but in any case, safety and sanitation equipment necessary for production and necessary and possible living welfare facilities cannot be saved. This year, we should better care for the lives of staff and workers under the condition of not increasing national expenditure and do more work to improve the lives of staff and workers. This is a responsibility of the trade union that cannot be ignored in the movement to increase production and practice economy.

    Expand and Improve the Democratic System of Enterprises
    Finally, I would also like to talk about the issue of expanding and improving the internal democratic system of enterprises. The Constitution stipulates that our country is a people's democratic country led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, and it is organized according to the principle of democratic centralism. The system of socialist enterprise management in our country should also be a system that combines democracy and centralism. This system is also a system that combines the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee and the mass supervision system under the leadership of the Party committee. Implementing the mass supervision system under the leadership of the Party committee is to implement the Party's mass line in our enterprise management work. The original democratic systems in our enterprises, such as the staff and worker representative conference system and the production conference system, have played a good role in giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. However, many cadres, due to the lack of a mass line style and due to one-sidedly emphasizing the "one-chief system", have neglected the use of the original democratic system in the enterprise, thus hindering the development of mass enthusiasm. The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China emphasized the expansion of the country's democratic life, and it is necessary to carry forward the tradition of the Party's mass line in enterprise management work in order to overcome the phenomena of bureaucracy and subjectivism in enterprise management work and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses to build socialism. Therefore, expanding and improving the democratic system of enterprises is a very important issue in the current industrial construction and trade union work.

    Existing experience has proven that the establishment of a staff and worker representative conference system in enterprises is a better form for staff and workers to participate in enterprise management and implement the mass supervision system under the leadership of the Party committee. The staff and worker representative conference should be an organ with power in the enterprise. It should have the right to listen to, discuss, and review the factory director's work report and major issues in all aspects of the enterprise, such as production plans, financial plans, production work, and all major issues in management work; it should have the right to discuss and decide on the use of expenses related to the life and welfare of staff and workers and the enterprise's bonus fund; it can also suggest the removal and recommendation of factory directors and other enterprise management personnel. The staff and worker representative conference is also the highest authority of the trade union's grassroots organization. The grassroots committee of the trade union should be the natural standing organ of the staff and worker representative conference. In this way, the trade union can truly play its role as a pillar of the people's democratic regime, mobilize the broad masses of staff and workers, and actively participate in enterprise management work with the attitude of being the masters of the country. Only in this way can our socialist enterprises, state-owned enterprises, and joint state-private enterprises, truly rely on the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of staff and workers and be well-managed with the participation and supervision of the broad masses.

    The above are some of the important aspects of mobilizing all positive factors in the working class itself to build socialism. Of course, due to the large increase in new workers, strengthening the political and ideological education of the working class and continuously improving the socialist consciousness of the working class is also a major task of the trade union at present. Due to time constraints, I will not talk about it.
    If there are any inappropriate points in my opinions, please give me your guidance, comrades.

### 把工人阶级积极因素充分调动起来  朱学范的发言

专栏：

    把工人阶级积极因素充分调动起来
    朱学范的发言
    我完全同意毛主席关于正确处理人民
  内部矛盾问题的指示和周总理出国访问的报告，完全同意陈云副总理关于增产节约问题的发言。
    我在中华全国总工会、中国国民党革命委员会和邮电部都担负有工作。在今天的会议上，我只想以工会工作者的身份，发表一些意见。
    建设社会主义是工人阶级和全国人民的切身事业。工人阶级是我们国家的领导阶级，它在建设社会主义的事业中，担负着特别重大的责任。工人阶级是实现社会主义工业化的主力。建设社会主义要调动和发挥全国人民的一切积极因素，首先就要把工人阶级的积极因素调动起来。而工人阶级自己的群众组织——工会，正是在这方面起着重大的作用。
    在第一个五年计划的头四年当中，全国各阶层人民都在自己的岗位上作出了巨大的贡献，工人阶级更发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，第一个五年计划的工业总产值已经提前一年完成。今年头两个月的工业生产计划也完成得很好。全国职工的这种积极行动，对于提前完成今年的任务和做好第二个五年计划的准备工作，创造了良好的条件。
    过去的一年，全国工会工作和其他战线上的工作一样，也有很大成绩。举比较突出的两件事来说：一件是去年在全国范围内开展的先进生产者运动，它已经成为广大职工建设社会主义的群众运动；一件是工会协助政府进行了全国规模的工资改革工作，并且做了许多有关职工生活福利的其他工作。这两件工作，对于发挥广大职工群众建设社会主义的积极性和创造性，是起了重大作用的。
    先进生产者运动的中心环节，就是推广先进经验。根据一机、二机、纺织、煤矿、农林水利、电力、邮电、铁路、公路运输、轻工、石油、建筑、盐业等十四个产业不完全的统计，去年上半年就总结和推广了五千六百八十九种先进经验。这些先进经验，对于提高劳动生产率有着极大的意义。例如煤矿工业中去年推广了一班采煤制的先进经验以后，就使生产率提高了20％到25％。广大职工在先进生产者运动中，研究和创造的精神空前高涨，提合理化建议已经形成风气。据1956年上半年统计，各地职工共提出了一百三十多万件合理化建议，相当于1954、1955两年的合理化建议总数。在已经实现的四十五万件合理化建议中，单拿可以计算价值的来说，就为国家创造了二亿五千六百多万元的财富。先进生产者运动不仅推动了职工群众学习科学技术和先进经验的热潮，而且也相应地推广了企业管理工作的改善。
    深入开展先进生产者运动
    今年，全国职工要响应党和政府开展增产节约工作的号召，就必须在去年已有的基础上，进一步深入地开展先进生产者运动。已有的经验证明：广大职工群众的先进生产者运动，就是充分发挥职工群众的积极性和创造性，在工业建设、交通运输和商业工作中实现增产节约的最有效的方法。要继续深入地开展先进生产者运动，就必须继续认真地贯彻互相学习、互相帮助、取长补短、共同提高的方针，继续实事求是地大力推广行之有效的先进经验。在先进生产者运动中，一方面要注意根据原材料供应的情况，努力增加产品的数量，努力节约原料、材料和燃料，同时必须注意提高产品的质量，注意安全生产。工会一方面要发动群众想尽一切办法，从各方面来增产节约，同时也要发动群众，监督那种片面地只顾产量，片面地强调节约，而不顾质量和不顾安全的偏向。
    在不增加国家开支的条件下
    更好地关心职工生活
    其次，我想谈谈关心职工生活的问题。在发展生产的基础上，逐步改善群众的生活。这是共产党和我国政府一贯坚持的方针。经过去年的工资改革，全国职工平均工资的增加，已经超过了第一个五年计划最后一年1957年的指标。应该肯定去年在全国范围内所进行的工资改革工作是必要的、正确的，成绩是很大的。通过工资改革，提高了工资水平，改进了工资制度，改善了职工群众的生活，鼓舞了职工群众的劳动积极性，并进一步密切了党、政府与群众的联系。工会在过去几年的工作中，曾经有过对职工群众的生活关心不够的缺点，这些缺点在去年已经开始纠正。当然，在去年的工资改革工作中，缺点也是不少的。比如对有些职工的工资提得多了一些，升级面大了一些，有些制度和办法的规定不切合实际。由于去年在工资福利方面增长得比较多，加以今年国家在财政上和物资供应上存在着一定的困难，所以今年国家一般地将不增加工资和福利费的开支。这是必要的。我听到有人说：“去年是改善生活年，今年是增产节约年！”这种把增产节约和改善生活相对立起来的看法是不对的。节约是必要的，可是无论如何也不能把生产必需的安全卫生设备和必要与可能的生活福利设施也节约掉。今年，我们应该在不增加国家开支的条件下，更好地关心职工生活，为改善职工生活作更多的工作，这是工会在增产节约运动中不可忽视的一种责任。
    扩大与健全企业的民主制度
    最后，我还想谈一谈扩大与健全企业内部的民主制度的问题。宪法规定我们的国家，是工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家，它是按照民主集中制的原则组织起来的。我们社会主义企业管理的制度，也应该是民主和集中相结合的制度。这种制度，也就是党委领导下的厂长负责制和党委领导下的群众监督制相结合的制度。实行党委领导下的群众监督制，就是在我们的企业管理工作中，贯彻实行党的群众路线。我们企业中原有的民主制度，像职工代表会议制度和生产会议制度等等，对于发挥群众的积极性和创造性是起过很好的作用的。可是，也有不少干部，由于缺乏群众路线的作风，由于片面地强调“一长制”，而忽视了企业中原有的民主制度的运用，因而妨碍了群众积极性的发挥。中共八大会上强调提出扩大国家的民主生活，在企业管理工作中必须发扬党的群众路线的传统，就是为了克服企业管理工作中的官僚主义和主观主义的现象，充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性来建设社会主义。因此，扩大与健全企业的民主制度，就是当前工业建设和工会工作中的一个十分重大的问题。
    已有的经验证明：在企业中建立职工代表大会制度，是职工群众参加企业管理，实行党委领导下的群众监督制的比较好的形式。职工代表大会，应该是企业中有权力的机关，它应当有权听取讨论和审查厂长的工作报告以及企业中各方面工作上的重大问题，例如生产计划、财务计划、生产工作和管理工作中的一切重大问题；它应当有权讨论和决定有关职工生活福利费用及企业奖励基金的使用；它也可以建议撤换和推荐厂长等企业管理人员。职工代表大会，同时也就是工会基层组织的最高权力机关。工会的基层委员会应该是职工代表大会的当然的常设机关。这样，工会也就真正能够发挥自己作为人民民主政权的支柱的作用，发动广大职工群众，以国家主人翁的态度，积极参加企业管理工作。也只有这样，我们的社会主义企业，国营企业和公私合营企业，才能够真正依靠广大职工群众的积极性和创造性，在广大群众的参加和监督下来办好。
    以上这些，我想就是在工人阶级本身调动一切积极因素来建设社会主义的几个重要方面。当然，由于新工人的大量增加，加强工人阶级的政治思想教育工作，不断地提高工人阶级的社会主义觉悟，这也是工会当前的一项重大任务。因为时间的关系就不说了。
    我的意见，如有不妥当的地方，请各位委员指教。
