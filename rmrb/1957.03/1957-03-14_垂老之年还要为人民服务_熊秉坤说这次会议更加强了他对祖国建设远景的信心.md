Serving the People Even in Old Age
Xiong Bingkun Says This Conference Has Further Strengthened His Confidence in the Future of National Construction

    I participated in this plenary session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference with incomparable excitement. This meeting was held after the basic victory of the three major socialist transformations, and also after Premier Zhou visited eleven countries in Europe and Asia, realizing his desire to seek friendship, peace, and knowledge. This means that our motherland has achieved unprecedented accomplishments on all fronts, from domestic to international. As Chairman Mao said, we are doing extremely glorious and great undertakings that our predecessors have never done before. Holding this plenary session today, when our glorious and great undertakings have achieved initial success, is even more significant.
    Before and during the meeting, we participated in the Supreme State Council meeting presided over by Chairman Mao, listened to Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, and also listened to Premier Zhou's report on his visit to eleven countries in Asia and Europe, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of some issues concerning the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the Standing Committee, and the speeches by Vice Premier Chen Yun and President Dong Biwu at the meeting. This is the first time in my life that I have received such profound political education, which has enabled me to further recognize the selfless and pragmatic spirit of the proletarian party in handling problems, and especially to recognize the thoroughness and maturity of the long-tested Chinese Communist Party in handling problems, thus strengthening my confidence in the motherland's step-by-step progress towards a bright and happy future. It makes me feel that even though I am old, I can still do something for the country and the people, and know the direction of my efforts.
    Our great motherland is now following the path of the October Revolution, and all our work is loyal to the international proletarian revolutionary movement, while also representing the interests of the Chinese people and conforming to national sentiments. This proves the wisdom and correctness of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Specifically, internally, we adhere to the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, while resolutely fighting against counter-revolutionaries; externally, we adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, while resolutely fighting against aggressive forces. This is unanimously supported by the Chinese people and the people of the world. We can clearly see that the economic and cultural construction of the motherland is progressing day by day, the lives of the people, especially the working people, are improving day by day, and our international status is rising day by day. When we look back at the historical situation, especially the historical situation of the past century, we are so excited that we don't know how to express our joy.
    Taiwan is the sacred territory of the motherland and still needs to be liberated. Our democratic parties and people from all walks of life must try every means to strive to realize the task of peaceful liberation of Taiwan. The Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan, including Chiang Kai-shek, if they still have a conscience, if they truly understand the situation of the motherland's construction over the years, should also return to the embrace of the motherland in the spirit of patriotism, unity, and common opposition to foreign enemies.

A Suggestion

    I am a member of the Wuchang Uprising of 1911 and have followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen for a long time. Last year, all parts of the country solemnly commemorated the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth. In Hubei, the tombs of the martyrs of the 1911 Revolution, Chu Wangtai, the Uprising Gate, and the establishment of the 1911 Revolution Memorial Hall were repaired. The State Council has already sent documents to the Hubei Provincial People's Committee, and the Provincial People's Committee is handling it. This is a great encouragement to me personally, to all the veterans of the 1911 Revolution, and to those who followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Now I further suggest that the government pay attention to all historical relics related to the revolution, such as the historical sites of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, which should be interviewed, collected, or repaired as soon as possible, so that people can develop patriotic ideas from the impressions of revolutionary deeds and strive hard for the construction of the motherland.

Two Wishes

    Finally, I would like to make two wishes to the conference: First, due to the continuous upsurge of our country's construction and the gradual improvement of people's lives, there are many aspects in which the supply cannot meet the demand. We should tell the people of all walks of life across the country to recognize that this is a temporary contradiction in the transitional period leading to the road of happiness, and everyone must launch a movement to increase production and practice economy, carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and simplicity, and carry out national construction through diligence and thrift to overcome the current difficulties. Second, the Party and Chairman Mao are uniting all possible forces and transforming negative factors into positive factors to build socialism. Under the leadership of the Party, we should unite the people of all walks of life across the country around the Party, give full play to our loyalty to the Party and the country, and boldly offer opinions to the Party based on what we have seen, heard, and known, so that the leadership can consider and do a good job in national affairs.

    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live the great people's leader Chairman Mao! (Attached picture)

### 垂老之年还要为人民服务  熊秉坤说这次会议更加强了他对祖国建设远景的信心

    垂老之年还要为人民服务
    熊秉坤说这次会议更加强了他对祖国建设远景的信心
    我以无比兴奋的心情，参加全国政协这次的全体会议。这次会议是在社会主义的三大改造基本胜利以后，同时是在周总理访问了欧亚两洲十一个国家，实现了寻求友谊、寻求和平、寻求知识的愿望以后召开的，这就是说，我们的祖国，从国内到国际，各个战线上都获得了空前的成就，正如毛主席所说的，我们正在做我们前人从未做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。我们在这样光荣伟大的事业得到初步成功的今天举行这次全体大会，意义越更显得重大。
    我们在会议前和会议中，参加了毛主席主持的最高国务会议，听了毛主席关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题的报告，又听了周总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告，李富春副总理关于第二个五年计划建议的若干问题的说明，陈叔通副主席关于常务委员会的工作报告，和陈云副总理、董必武院长在会议上的发言。这是我有生以来第一次受到深刻意义的政治教育，使我进一步认识到无产阶级政党处理问题的大公无私和实事求是的精神，特别认识到久经锻炼的中国共产党处理问题的周密和成熟，因而加强了我对祖国一步步走向光明幸福前途的信心。使我感到虽然已经是垂老之年，还可以为国家为人民做一点事，并且知道如何努力的方向。
    我们的伟大祖国，现在走的是十月革命的道路，一切工作忠实于国际无产阶级革命运动，同时又代表着中国人民利益和符合民族感情，这证明中国共产党和毛主席领导的英明和正确。具体的讲，对内坚持长期共存、互相监督的方针，同时坚决与反革命作斗争；对外坚持和平共处的五项原则，同时坚决与侵略势力作斗争，这是全中国人民所一致拥护的，也是全世界人民所一致拥护的。我们很清楚地看到：祖国的经济、文化建设一天天地进步，全国人民特别是劳动人民的生活一天天地改善，我们在国际上的地位一天天地提高。我们回头把历史上的情况特别是近百年来的历史情况比照一下，真是不知手之舞之、足之蹈之，感到难以形容的兴奋。
    台湾是祖国的神圣领土，还有待于解放。我们各民主党派和社会人士，要想尽一切方法，努力实现和平解放台湾的任务。在台湾的国民党军政人员，包括蒋介石在内，如果还有良心，如果确实了解祖国这多年建设的情况，也应当本爱国一家、一致对外的精神，回到祖国的怀抱。一项建议
    我是参加辛亥首义的一员，长期跟随过孙中山先生。去年全国各地隆重地纪念中山先生诞辰九十周年，在湖北，修理辛亥烈士墓、楚望台、起义门和设立辛亥首义纪念馆，国务院已有文件到湖北省人民委员会，省人委正在办理中。这对我个人，对所有的辛亥首义老人，对跟随过中山先生的人，都是莫大的鼓舞。现在我进一步建议，请政府注意一切有关革命的历史文物，像抗日战争、解放战争的历史遗迹，都应该早日采访、收罗或修建，使人们从革命事迹的观感中发挥爱国思想，为建设祖国艰苦奋斗。两点愿望
    最后，我对大会提出两点愿望：第一、由于我国建设事业不断的高涨，人民生活逐步提高，有很多方面出现了供不应求的现象，我们应当告诉全国各界人民认清这是过渡时期通向幸福道路的暂时矛盾，必须大家展开增产节约运动，发挥艰苦朴素的优良传统，进行勤俭建国，克服当前的困难。第二、党和毛主席正在团结一切可能团结的力量，化消极因素为积极因素，来建设社会主义，我们应当在党的领导下，把全国各界人民团结在党的周围，发挥对党对国的忠诚，就自己所见所闻和所知的，大胆地对党提出意见，以供领导上考虑，把国家大事办好。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的人民领袖毛主席万岁！（附图片）
