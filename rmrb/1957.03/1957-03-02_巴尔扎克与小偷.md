    Balzac and the Thief
    French writer Balzac was poor all his life. One night, a thief slipped into his house and began rummaging through his desk.
    Balzac lit a candle while laughing heartily, and he said to the terrified thief:
   “Don’t be afraid, my dear friend, I am laughing at myself. This is funny. You actually want to find money in my place in such a dark night. I have been looking for a long time in broad daylight, and I haven’t even found a sou.”
   (Translated by Ji Kun from the German "Anecdotes")

    巴尔扎克与小偷
    法国作家巴尔扎克一辈子闹穷。一天晚上有个小偷溜进了他的屋子，开始翻检他的书桌。
    巴尔扎克一边呵呵大笑一边点着了蜡烛，他对惊骇不已的小偷叫道：
   “我笑我的，您可别怕，亲爱的朋友。这本来好笑哇。这么一片黑夜，您居然想在我这儿找出钱来，大白日里我找过老半天的啦，连一个苏也没发现哩。”
   （纪琨译自德文“谐趣集”）
