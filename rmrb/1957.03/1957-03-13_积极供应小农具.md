Xinhua News Agency, March 11th: Learning from the lesson of small farm tool shortages during the spring plowing season last year, many regions' supply and marketing cooperatives are organizing supplies early this year to increase the variety and quantity of small farm tools. The supply and marketing cooperatives in Guizhou Province will supply farmers with about 24% more small farm tools this year than last year. According to the new needs of farmers, supply and marketing cooperatives in Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, have generally increased the supply of light and durable small farm tools, and the number of small farm tools prepared is now more than 30 types more than in the same period last year. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Fengcheng, Haicheng, Gaiping, Changtu, Panshan, Andong and other counties in Liaoning Province have prepared more than 380,000 pieces of small farm tools urgently needed for spring plowing, such as plowshares and iron shovels. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Henan, Hebei, Sichuan, Anhui, Shandong and other places have also prepared a large number of small farm tools. Now, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places are supplying the prepared small farm tools to farmers. In the process of organizing the production of small farm tools, many regions are also paying attention to tapping the potential of local scrap steel and iron to overcome the shortage of raw materials.

    积极供应小农具
    据新华社11日讯　很多地区的供销合作社接受去年春耕时期小农具脱销的教训，今年提早组织货源，增加小农具的品种和数量。贵州省各地供销社今年供应农民的小农具将比去年增加24％左右。山西长治专区各县供销社根据农民新的需要，普遍增加了轻便耐用的小农具，现在备妥的小农具比去年同期增加了三十多种。辽宁省凤城、海城、盖平、昌图、盘山、安东等县供销社，准备了三十八万多件春耕中迫切需要的铧子、铁锨等小农具。河南、河北、四川、安徽、山东等地供销社也准备了大量小农具。现在各地供销社正把准备好的小农具供应给农民。不少地区在组织小农具生产中，还注意发掘地方废钢废铁的潜力，以克服原料不足的困难。
