　  To Organize the Masses to Check and Supervise Each Other in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement
　　Liu Luyin's Speech
    I fully support Chairman Mao's speech, Premier Zhou's and Vice Premier Li's reports, and I agree with Vice Chairman Chen's work report on the Standing Committee. In addition, I fully agree with Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech on increasing production and practicing economy and Vice Chairman Dong Biwu's speech on political and legal work.
    Now I would like to talk about my opinions on carrying out a nationwide movement to increase production and practice economy in 1957.
    Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech has fully and correctly explained the special importance of carrying out a systematic movement to increase production and practice economy nationwide, pointed out the specific directions for increasing production and practicing economy, and concluded that we require the government, the military, factories, enterprises, schools, and institutions to formulate plans for increasing production and practicing economy based on their respective situations and vigorously carry out the nationwide movement to increase production and practice economy. I believe that Vice Premier Chen's talk about carrying out increasing production and practicing economy is completely based on the actual development of various aspects of the country and also provides principled instructions, which each of us should strive to implement in our respective practical work. However, I would like to make a suggestion here: While launching a systematic movement to increase production and practice economy nationwide, it is also necessary to create an atmosphere among the masses where they check waste and correct waste phenomena themselves. The method is to mobilize colleagues in various government departments, soldiers at all levels in the army, factory workers, enterprise colleagues, school faculty and students, and staff of institutions to conduct mutual inspections and supervision internally at any time and in any matter according to the increase production and practice economy plans made by each unit, in order to save all possible expenses and avoid waste of materials. Among the people of the whole country, we should also mobilize the broad masses of people to conduct frequent checks and supervisions, known to every household, so that everyone saves and every family saves. It is necessary to create an atmosphere where the masses check waste and oppose waste themselves, and this atmosphere should be developed into a system in order to truly implement the movement to increase production and practice economy to the end.
    Some people may say: We are carrying out a movement to increase production and practice economy. On the one hand, we have the increase production and practice economy movement committees at all levels from top to bottom and the increase production and practice economy work groups at the grassroots level. On the other hand, our country has a system of people's supervision and inspection. Why should we worry that the increase production and practice economy cannot be implemented to the end? My answer is: These organizations and systems are necessary and indispensable. However, as Vice Premier Chen said, increasing production and practicing economy is a basic method for us to carry out socialist construction, and the waste phenomena that exist are almost like hidden enemies, which are often not easy to detect. Because in fact, in building such a large socialist country, there is no waste in planning in all undertakings, but there is waste in execution; there is no waste in big aspects, but there is waste in small aspects; there is no waste in indicators, but there is waste in the production process; there is no waste in production, but there is waste in consumption; in a word, leaks are inevitable everywhere. It is not enough to plug the leaks by relying solely on the increase production and practice economy committees or work groups at all levels; it is also not enough to rely solely on the supervision and inspection agencies that only take action when there are regular or accidental events; only by relying on the masses under the leadership can the waste phenomena hidden in every corner be thoroughly exposed and eliminated; in this way, the universal effect of increasing production and practicing economy can be achieved.
    In order to enable the personnel or employees of each unit to carry out mass mutual inspection to avoid waste, there must be certain ways and methods of checking waste. However, the nature and duties of each unit are different, so the ways and methods of checking waste in each unit are naturally different. This requires the personnel of each unit to determine the ways and methods of checking waste in their own unit through discussion. The main thing is: this method should focus on the following important key points: (1) Saving is not for anything else, but for doing a good job in production; (2) Saving is to save raw materials, reduce costs, and improve quality; (3) Saving is to ensure a reasonable supply of basic necessities. I believe that as long as there are ways and methods of checking waste that are determined by grasping the above key points, and the masses are allowed to check each other according to these ways and methods, it can be guaranteed that the movement to increase production and practice economy will achieve a complete victory.

### 在增产节约运动中要组织群众互相检查监督　刘芦隐的发言

　  在增产节约运动中要组织群众互相检查监督
　　刘芦隐的发言
    我完全拥护毛主席的讲话，周总理和李副总理的报告，并同意陈副主席关于常务委员会的工作报告。此外，我还完全同意陈云副总理关于增产节约问题和董必武副主席关于政法工作问题的发言。
    现在我要谈一谈我对于1957年开展全国范围的增产节约运动的意见。
    陈云副总理的发言，已充分正确地说明了我们要在全国范围内有系统地开展增产节约运动的特别重要意义，指出了应当进行增产节约的具体方向，并且归结地说：我们要求政府，军队，工厂，企业，学校，事业单位，根据各个单位的情况，作出增产节约的方案，有力地开展全国增产节约运动。我认为陈副总理关于进行增产节约的这种谈话完全是根据全国各方面的实际发展情况而又作出了有原则性的指示的，是我们每一个人在其各不相同的实际工作中都应该努力贯彻下去的。但是，我要在这里提出一个建议：在与全国展开有系统的增产节约运动的同时，还必须从群众中造成一个由群众自己互相检查浪费现象和纠正浪费现象的风气，其办法就是要动员政府各部门的同事人员，军队各级员兵，工厂职工，企业同业人员，学校教职员学生，事业单位的工作人员，根据各个单位所作出的增产节约方案，在内部随时随事作相互的检查和监督，以期把一切可以节省的开支做到节省，把一切可以避免浪费的物力做到不浪费。在全国人民中间，也同样地动员广大人民群众，家喻户晓地互相作经常的检查和督促，做到人人节约，家家储蓄。必须要造成群众自己互相检查浪费和反对浪费这样一种风气，而且要由这一种风气发展成为一种制度，才能把增产节约运动如实地贯彻到底。
    有人要说：我们进行增产节约的运动，一方面，有由上而下的各级增产节约运动委员会以及基层的增产节约运动工作组，另一方面，我们的国家有人民监察制度和检查制度，还愁增产节约不能贯彻到底吗？我的回答是：这些组织和制度都是必要的，缺一不可的，但是，增产节约，既如陈副总理所说，是我们进行社会主义建设的基本方法，而我们存在的浪费现象，几乎是等于暗藏的敌人，往往不容易发觉，因为事实上，我们建设这么大的一个社会主义国家，在一切事业中，规划上无浪费，执行上有浪费；大的方面无浪费，小的方面有浪费；指标上无浪费，生产过程中有浪费；生产方面无浪费，消费方面有浪费；一句话，处处都不免有漏卮。要塞漏卮，单靠各级增产节约委员会或工作组去作，是不够的；单靠各地有定期有事故才去动手的监察和检查机关去巡查，也还是不够的；只有依靠在领导下的群众，才能把暗藏在每一角落里的浪费现象彻底暴露和肃清；这样，才能收到增产节约的普遍的效果。
    要使每一个单位的人员或职工们能够进行群众性的互相检查，免除浪费，还必须有一定的检查浪费的方式方法，而每一个单位的性质和职务不同，因而每一个单位自己检查浪费的方式方法也当然有所不同，这就需要由每一个单位的人员通过大家讨论把它本单位检查浪费的方式方法确定起来。主要的是：这种方式方法要抓紧如下的重要关键：（1）节约不是为了别的，而是为了搞好生产；（2）节约是为了节省原材料，降低成本，提高质量；（3）节约是为了保证基本需要品的合理供应。我认为只要有了抓着上述几个重要关键而定出来的检查浪费的方式方法，让群众去按照这种方式方法互相检查，那就能保证增产节约运动取得彻底的胜利。（附图片）
