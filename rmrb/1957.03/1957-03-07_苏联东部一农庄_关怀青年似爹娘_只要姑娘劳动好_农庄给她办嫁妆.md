Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th -- The fact that a collective farm in the Soviet Union prepares dowries for girls who are getting married has aroused great interest.

This collective farm is called "For Peace and Labor" and it is located in the Krasnodar Krai. Not long ago, Mariya's daughter, Nina, the daughter of an old farm member, and Mikhail, a demobilized soldier, got married, and received a rich dowry. On the wedding day, more than a hundred guests came, all vying to see the bride's dowry. There was a bed, a table, blankets, a wardrobe, and so on.

The chairman of the farm said at the wedding ceremony that giving dowries to girls is a traditional Russian custom. In the past, parents always gave some property to their daughters as dowry. Now that the farm has become rich, it can not only issue pensions to elderly farm members, give farmers regular vacations, and give pregnant women and mothers maternity leave with pay, but also provide dowries for young people starting new families. It is entirely reasonable for the farm to assume this responsibility, which was previously borne by the parents.

The method of the farm preparing wedding dowries for young people started this year, but not everyone can get the farm's dowry, only those young people who work particularly hard can get it.

The "For Peace and Labor" collective farm has already stipulated this new measure in the collective farm's charter. Since the beginning of this year, thirteen newly married couples have received dowries prepared by the farm.

### 苏联东部一农庄　关怀青年似爹娘  只要姑娘劳动好　农庄给她办嫁妆

    苏联东部一农庄　关怀青年似爹娘
    只要姑娘劳动好　农庄给她办嫁妆
    新华社莫斯科6日电　苏联一个集体农庄为姑娘结婚备办嫁妆的事引起了人们巨大的兴趣。
    这个集体农庄名叫“为了和平和劳动”，它在克拉斯诺达边疆区。不久以前，老庄员玛利亚的女儿尼娜和复员军人米哈依尔结婚，就得到了一份丰富的嫁妆。结婚这一天，贺客来了一百多人，大家都争看新娘的嫁妆。这里有床、桌子、被子、衣柜等等。
    农庄主席在结婚典礼上说，给姑娘作嫁妆是俄罗斯传统的风俗。过去总是由父母分一部分财物给自己的女儿做嫁妆。现在农庄富裕起来了，农庄不仅能发给年老庄员以养老金，能给农民定期休假，给孕妇和产妇以假期和在假期中照付劳动报酬，并且还能给成立新家庭的青年置嫁妆。这一项过去由父母担负的责任现在由农庄担负起来是完全合情合理的。
    这个农庄给青年准备结婚嫁妆的办法是从今年开始实行的，但是不是任何人都可以得到农庄的嫁妆的，只是那些劳动特别勤快的青年才可以得到。
    “为了和平和劳动”集体农庄已经把这一新的措施明文规定在集体农庄的章程里了。从今年初到现在已经有十三对新婚夫妇获得了农庄备办的嫁妆。
