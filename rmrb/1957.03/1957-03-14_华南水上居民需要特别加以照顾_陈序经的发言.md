Hua Nan's Floating Population Needs Special Care
Chen Xujing's Speech

There are 1.5 million floating residents in Fujian, Guangxi, and Guangdong provinces. In feudal society, they suffered severe discrimination and abuse. After liberation, although their lives have improved significantly, they are still extremely backward economically and culturally.

I would like to talk about some opinions on the floating residents of Hua Nan.

The floating residents I am referring to here are those previously called "Dan Min" or "Dan Jia." "Dan" is also written as "Yan" or "Dan." They themselves do not like this name. They say they were originally called "Da Jia." However, this term is not found in historical records. I think it would be more appropriate to use the character "Dan" instead of "Dan" now. Otherwise, it doesn't seem inappropriate to use the name "Da Jia."

These floating residents are different from the Jiu Xing fishing households in the Qiantang River or other floating residents. Currently, only Fujian, Guangxi, and Guangdong have these floating residents. They are distributed in the rivers or coastal areas of these three provinces. The places where they gather are mostly cities or densely populated areas on land. In Guangzhou, before the Anti-Japanese War, their number reached more than 100,000, and now there are still about 70,000. It is estimated that there are at least 1.5 million in these three provinces, especially in Guangdong. Because they live on the water and many are distributed along the coast, they are the outposts of our national defense.

Historically, these floating residents were not necessarily water dwellers before the Tang Dynasty. They lived on land like other land residents. According to Chang Qu's "Huayang Guozhi" of the Jin Dynasty, they were mostly distributed in various parts of Sichuan and some parts of Guizhou during the Three Kingdoms and Jin Dynasties. During the Northern and Southern Dynasties, Lu Teng had to use great force to suppress them. In the Tang Dynasty, they were formidable opponents of Li Deyu and Gao Pian.

It was not until the Song Dynasty that they were called floating residents. The correct explanation for why they changed from land dwellers to water dwellers has not yet been found. It may have been due to oppression by the Han people that they moved to live on the water.

An earlier and more detailed record of these floating residents is Zhou Qufei's "Lingwai Daida" from the Song Dynasty. In this book, there is a passage describing these floating residents. He said: "They take boats as their homes and regard water as land. Those who float on rivers and seas are called Yan." He also said: "All Yan are extremely poor, and their clothes are all patched up. If they get a handful of rice, their wives and children share it. Husbands and wives live under the awning, and they have many children, with no less than ten children in a boat. When the children can hold themselves, their mothers tie them to their backs with soft cloth and paddle as usual. When the children can crawl, a long rope is tied around their waists, with a short piece of wood tied to the end of the rope. If the child suddenly falls into the water, they are pulled out by pulling on the rope. When the children learn to walk, they walk back and forth on the ridge of the awning without being surprised. When they can walk, they can already float and dive. When the Yan boats are docked, the children play in the sand, without a thread of clothing in winter and summer."

From the Song Dynasty to before liberation, although about a thousand years have passed, the poor life of these floating residents has not changed significantly. Everything described by Zhou Qufei is still preserved to some extent today.

In the era of feudal society, they suffered heavy oppression. They suffered exorbitant taxes and various particularly severe discrimination and abuse. For example, they were not allowed to participate in the imperial examinations. They were not allowed to wear red skirts when they got married. In addition, they were prevented from living on land. Even the feudal ruler Yongzheng felt injustice for them and therefore issued an order against it. Men were called "Dan Jia thieves" by some people, and women were called "Salty Water Sisters"—the latter term undoubtedly appeared after the invasion of imperialists.

After liberation, the Party and the People's Government were very concerned about them and sent special personnel to understand their living conditions several times. During the land reform period, some of them were also given land. At the same time, a lot of work was done in other aspects to improve their lives. They take boats as their homes and their whereabouts are uncertain, making it difficult to receive educational opportunities. Therefore, floating schools were set up, or schools were opened on land specifically for them, encouraging them to study. Floating cultural boats and floating medical boats were mainly set up for them. They were also introduced to find jobs, and those who had too much difficulty in life were given relief. At the same time, they were helped to build houses and move to land.

In addition, the Nationalities Affairs Commission also held meetings to discuss whether they should be regarded as ethnic minorities. According to some people's opinions, since the places where they live are often also densely populated areas on land, and the two have long-term close contact and live together, unlike many other ethnic minorities who have a concentrated and fixed area of residence, it is not easy to divide them into an autonomous region. Therefore, until now, they are not regarded as ethnic minorities. It should be pointed out that in our motherland, many ethnic minorities are also scattered in various places and cannot be divided into autonomous regions according to region.

Personally, I think that historically, these floating residents are undoubtedly a kind of ethnic minority. Although they now have close ties with land residents, the fact is that living on the water and living on the land is a very significant basic difference. Therefore, I feel that if they are regarded as a kind of ethnic minority, there seems to be no reason to criticize it.

However, what is more important is to look at their economic and cultural life. For a thousand years, they have lived on boats, and their economy is extremely difficult. Zhou Qufei's saying that "all Yan are extremely poor" still has great reality. Because of poverty, they have no opportunity to receive education. Coupled with a small boat, they may be in this place today and in another place tomorrow, or even a very far away place. Even if they have the ability to provide their children with schooling, there are many difficulties. Poverty and no education make it difficult to improve the situation of poverty. No wonder when the Party and the People's Government called for the elimination of illiteracy, some of these floating residents in Guangzhou mistakenly thought that all illiterate people would be eliminated. When they heard people say that they were going to publicize literacy to them, some of them were frightened and avoided them. It was not until the comrades who worked there explained the truth clearly that they still felt that learning culture was extremely difficult for themselves.

After liberation, although their lives have improved a lot, from the whole point of view, they are still relatively poor people. Moreover, from an individual point of view, some people's lives are even more difficult. For example, since the establishment of the Guangzhou Over-the-River Ferry Company, there are many electric boats crossing the river, and thousands of people who used to make a living by carrying passengers across the river have been greatly affected. In the past, a family of five could earn more than one yuan a day, but now many can only earn one or two jiao. Although the People's Government tries its best to provide relief, relief is not a fundamental solution. Moreover, they are working people, accustomed to working life, and not only are unwilling to sit and wait for care, but also feel that this approach is shameful.

My opinion is that there should be no problem in treating them as an ethnic minority. But it should also be pointed out that whether to do so is a secondary issue. The main issue is that because they are extremely backward economically and culturally, they need special care. If we do not regard them as ethnic minorities, then before all or most of them have not moved to land and at the same time their economic and cultural life has not been significantly improved, in order to take care of their special circumstances, an agency should be established to specifically handle or solve their problems, so that their economic and cultural life can receive comprehensive and special care, gradually eliminate their backward phenomenon, and be able to move towards the bright road of socialism together with the people of all ethnic groups in the country more quickly.

As for how to establish a specific agency and how to solve the problems, I think the Nationalities Affairs Commission and relevant parties should consider it in detail before making a decision. Whether the above opinions are appropriate, please correct me. (Attached picture)

### 华南水上居民需要特别加以照顾  陈序经的发言

    华南水上居民需要特别加以照顾
    陈序经的发言
    福建、广西、广东三省一百五十万水上居民。在封建社会里，他们遭受严重的歧视和虐待；解放以后，生活虽有很多改善，但是经济上文化上仍极为落后。
    我想谈谈关于华南的水上居民的一点意见。
    我在这里所说的水上居民，是以往所称的“蛋民”或“蛋家”。“蛋”又作“蜒”或作“疍”。他们自己并不喜欣这个名称。他们说：他们原来是叫做“大家”。可是这个名词并没有见于志书。我以为现在若用“旦”字去代替“蛋”字，较为合适。否则，就用“大家”这个名称，似也不见得不妥当。
    这种水上居民与钱塘江的九姓渔户，或其他的水上居民，是不同的。现在只在福建、广西、广东才有这种水上居民。他们分布于这三省的河流或沿海各处。其所聚集的地方，多为都市或陆地人烟比较稠密的地方。广州在抗战前，他们的人数达十余万，现在还有约七万。估计这三省至少有一百五十万，尤以广东为最多。由于他们是水居，而且有很多分布于沿海一带，他们是我们的国防的前哨。
    从历史上看起来，这种水上居民，在唐以前，并不见得是水居。他们和其他的陆地居民一样的住在陆上。据晋常璩的华阳国志记载，在三国与晋的时代，他们多分布于四川各处以及在贵州一些地方。南北朝时，陆腾要用很大的力量始把他们压制，在唐代，他们是李德裕与高骈的劲敌。
    到了宋代，他们才被称为水上居民。为什么他们从陆居而变为水居，还找不出正确的解释。可能是受了汉族的压迫而迁居水上。
    关于这种的水上居民的记载较早而较为详细的，是宋代周去非的岭外代答。在这本书里，有一段是叙述这种水上居民的。他说：“以舟为室，视水如陆，浮生江海者，蜒也。”他又说：“凡蜒极贫，衣皆鹑结。得掬米，妻子共之。夫妇居篷下，生子乃猥多，一舟不下十子。儿能自孩，其母以软帛束之背上，荡桨自如。儿能匍匐，则以长绳系其腰，于绳末系短木焉。儿忽堕水，以缘绳汲出之。儿学行，往来篷脊，殊不惊也。能行则已能浮没。蜒舟泊岸，群儿戏沙中，冬夏身无一缕。”
    从宋代到解放以前，虽然经过约有千年之久，但这种水上居民的贫苦生活，并没有什么显著的改变，周去非所描写的一切情况与习俗，到今还多少保留着。
    在封建社会的时代，他们曾受了重重的压迫。他们受了苛捐杂税以及各色各样特别严重的歧视和虐待。譬如科举考试，不许他们参加。他们结婚时，不准穿着红裙。此外，又如阻止他们上岸居住，这件事连了封建统治者雍正，也为了他们抱不平，因而下令反对。男的被一些人称为“蛋家贼”，女的被一些叫做“咸水妹”——后一名词，无疑的是帝国主义者入侵以后才出现的。
    解放以后，党与人民政府对于他们十分关怀，数次派专人去了解他们的生活状况。在土改时期，他们之中，也有的分得土地。同时，在其他方面，作了很多改善他们生活的工作。他们以舟为室，萍踪匪定，难得受教育的机会，乃设立水上学校，或在陆上专为他们开办学校，鼓励他们读书。水上文化船，水上医疗船，主要的都是为着他们而设置的。又介绍他们找职业，生活太困难者，给以救济。同时，又帮助他们建筑房舍、移居陆地。
    此外，民族事务委员会还开过会议，讨论他们是否应当为少数民族来看待。根据一些人的意见，他们所聚居的地方，既然往往也是陆地人烟比较稠密的地方，两者长期密切往来，错居杂处，不像其他的好多少数民族，有了集中居住的固定范围，因而不易分为一个自治区域，所以直到现在，他们并不当为少数民族来看待。应该指出，在我们祖国里，好多少数民族中也有一些散居各处，不能按地区去分为自治区域的。
    我个人以为从历史上看起来，这种水上居民，没有问题的是一种少数民族。现在他们虽然与陆上居民有了密切的关系，可是事实上，水居与陆居就是一种很显著的基本差别。因此，我觉得若当他们为一种少数民族来看待，似也没有可以非议的理由。
    然而更重要的，是从经济与文化的生活来看，他们一千年来，以舟为生，经济极为困难。周去非所说：“凡蜒极贫”这句话，还有很大的现实性。因为贫苦而没有机会去受教育，加以一叶扁舟，今日在这个地方，明日可能在别的地方，或是很远的地方，就是有能力去供给其子女入校的，也有好多困难。贫苦而没有教育，贫苦的情况，是不易改善的。怪不得当党与人民政府号召扫除文盲的时候，广州有些这种水上居民，误会以为凡是文盲者，都要被淘汰了。听了人们说要向他们宣传扫盲时，他们有的骇怕起来，避而不见。直等到工作同志把这个道理说清楚后，他们还是觉得学习文化，对他们自己来说，是存在着极大的困难。
    解放以后，他们的生活虽然有了很多的改善，可是从整个来看，还是较为贫穷的人民。而且，从个别的情形来看，有的生活更加困难。比方，自广州过江的轮渡公司成立之后，过江多有电船，过去成千成万靠着载客渡江为活者，大受影响。以往一家五口，每天入息有一元以上者，现在，很多只能得一二角。虽然人民政府尽量设法去救济，可是救济并不是治本的办法。而且，他们是劳动人民，惯于劳动生活，不只不愿坐待照顾，而且觉得这样做法，是可耻的。
    我的意见是，当他们为少数民族来处理，应该没有问题。但也应该指出，是否这样去做，还是次要的问题，主要的问题是：因为他们在经济上，在文化上，都极为落后，需要特别加以照顾。如果我们不当他们为少数民族来看待，那么在他们全部或绝大部分尚未迁居陆地而同时他们的经济与文化生活还没有显著的改善之前，为着照顾他们这种特殊情况，应该设立一种机构，专为处理或解决他们的问题，使他们的经济与文化的生活，能得到全面与特殊的照顾，逐渐消灭其落后的现象，更快的能与全国各族人民，一齐走向社会主义的光明大道。
    至于具体的机构如何设立和问题如何解决，我觉得应由民族事务委员会与有关方面，加以详细的考虑，然后决定。以上的意见，是否有当，请各委员指正。（附图片）
