　　Thoroughly Implement the Policy of "Eradicating All Counter-revolutionaries, Correcting All Mistakes"
　　Lu Yaolin Discusses the Work of Suppressing Counter-revolutionaries in Hubei Province
　　I attended this meeting as a nonvoting delegate, and listened to Chairman Mao's instructions at the Supreme State Conference on correctly handling contradictions among the people, Premier Zhou's report on his visits to eleven countries in Europe and Asia, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the Standing Committee of the CPPCC. After group discussions, my thinking has been greatly improved, and I guarantee to earnestly implement the spirit of this meeting in my work. Today, I would like to offer some personal opinions on the situation of suppressing counter-revolutionary elements and the existing problems.

　　The Policy of Suppressing Counter-revolutionaries is Correct
　　First, I believe that launching the second movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries in 1955 was absolutely necessary. We remember that in 1954 and the first half of 1955, enemies in the Hubei region and Wuhan city took advantage of the severe difficulties after the flood disaster, and the right-leaning paralysis of our state organs and staff. During the implementation of central tasks such as the unified purchase and sale of grain, the issuance of new Renminbi, and the conscription of soldiers, their activities were extremely rampant. They created reactionary rumors, incited the masses, and attempted to cause social disorder in order to achieve their counter-revolutionary sabotage purposes. For example, they spread rumors that "this year's (1955) flood is five feet higher than last year's," and in the Xiaogan area, there were rumors of "underworld soldiers" passing by. Many areas created situations of banditry, and the masses were falsely chasing "bandits," with participation ranging from dozens to over a thousand people, affecting mass production. At the same time, special agents sent by the US-Chiang Kai-shek spy agencies, remaining counter-revolutionary elements who escaped the net, reactionary elements in the puppet military, government, police, and secret service, as well as a small number of reactionary landlord class elements in the countryside who repeatedly refused to be reformed, also began direct sabotage activities. For example, the counter-revolutionary Zhang Bozhai (already executed), who had served as a Bao Chief, Joint Defense Director, and Inspector General of the Fifth War Zone Military Police Inspectorate, fled to Hankou when Jun County was liberated. After national liberation, he hid for a long time and carried out sabotage activities, having carved two seals of the Fourth District Office and Renyi Township Government of Guanghua County, forged documents, and roamed through Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Hebei and other provinces. He even shouted reactionary slogans at the Wuhan wharf on September 27, 1954, during the convening of the National People's Congress, attempting to distribute pre-written reactionary slogans. Another example is the counter-revolutionary Zheng Jiyun (already arrested). When the people of Wuhan were fighting the flood with tension and difficulty in 1954, Zheng incited more than 30 dike repair workers to escape on the Hanyang Dike, seriously affecting the completion of the dike defense task. Another example is the spy case of Jiao Zhibin, which was cracked by the Wuhan Municipal Public Security Bureau in March 1956. Before being dispatched in 1951 to 1954, Jiao had received special agent spy training from the Second Department of the puppet Ministry of National Defense in Taiwan. After sneaking into Wuhan in 1956 and mixing into the Tianhua Factory, he collected military information such as the training of fighter jets of the People's Liberation Army Air Force stationed in Wuhan, the distribution of searchlights, and the location of military warehouses, and sent it to the spy agency in cipher, believing that the conditions were ripe. Jiao asked the spy agency for a radio station (which has been seized) in preparation for long-term lurking and sabotage of socialist construction. Furthermore, the enemy situation within our state organs, organizations, schools, and factories and enterprises is also quite serious. Only in the units in Hubei Province that carried out the anti-counterrevolutionary movement in the first batch, it has been verified that as many as 2,784 counter-revolutionary elements and other bad elements, accounting for 1.79% of the total number of people participating in the first batch of the anti-counterrevolutionary movement. Although the counter-revolutionary elements who have infiltrated the interior are very few, the extent of their damage and harm is extremely great. For example, the counter-revolutionary Guo Jiguang, who was found in Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, infiltrated Wuhan Iron and Steel and became a draftsman. He once took advantage of his position to intentionally sabotage the construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel, modifying the elevation of the topographic map of the plant in 19 places. Fortunately, it was discovered early and no serious losses were caused. According to another report, among more than 1,000 senior intellectuals in 14 universities in the Wuhan area, 33 counter-revolutionary elements and other bad elements were found. From the nature of the cases: 5 were special agents and spies, 16 were backbones of reactionary parties and groups, 6 were reactionary elements in the puppet military, government, police, and secret service, 3 were landlords and local bullies, and 3 were other elements.

　　The above situations are sufficient to prove that counter-revolutionary elements exist, our enemies are not sleeping, and the methods and means of struggle they adopt are more concealed and cunning. Conversely, the cadres of our state organs have developed ideas of underestimation of the enemy and paralysis, and have relaxed the fight against the enemy for a time. Therefore, the masses criticized us. A person in Jiang'an District of Wuhan City reflected to the Municipal People's Procuratorate with the title of "Checking and Handling Errors of Counter-revolutionary Elements Under the Illumination of the General Line," criticizing our right-leaning thinking in dealing with counter-revolutionary elements and our ineffective struggle against the enemy. A person in Jianghan District questioned the public security police station: "Are the government's eyes blind again?" Therefore, according to the spirit of the resolution on the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy at Second Session of the First National People's Congress that "state organs at all levels and the people of the whole country must fully raise revolutionary vigilance, eliminate all open and hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and smash the sabotage activities of domestic and foreign enemies against our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation," the policy was completely correct from the point of view of both the enemy's sabotage activities and the demands of the people. Precisely because resolute and effective measures were taken, favorable conditions were created for the socialist transformation of the three major areas in our country. I believe this is the main achievement and basic aspect of the second anti-counterrevolutionary campaign since 1955.

　　Since 1955, the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries has been basically thorough and meticulous, and has been carried out on the basis of investigation and research. The implementation of the line of "combining specialized organs with the broad masses" and the anti-counterrevolutionary policy of "combining suppression with leniency" have become more specific. In particular, under the influence of the new situation of the three major socialist upsurges, the remaining counter-revolutionary elements have become increasingly isolated, and the general trend has also undergone new changes. The counter-revolutionary elements have begun to differentiate and disintegrate internally. Many people are willing to start anew and get close to the government and the people. At the same time, the government has given them more lenient opportunities for repentance. Counter-revolutionary elements can only obtain the understanding of the people and the leniency of the government by surrendering to the people's government, confessing honestly and thoroughly their crimes. According to statistics in Wuhan from January to September 1956, 813 counter-revolutionary elements surrendered to the public security organs and confessed their crimes. The procuratorial, judicial, and public security organs promptly gave lenient treatment according to the degree of truthfulness of their confessions, strictly in accordance with the policy of "leniency for confession, severity for resistance, merit to offset crimes, and rewards for great merit." For example, the counter-revolutionary Zhang Pei was a bandit before liberation, robbing people of their property everywhere. After liberation, he robbed and killed two comrades, the secretary and cook of the 8th District Government of Tang County, Henan Province. He fled to Wuhan under the pseudonym Zhang Huafu, and concealed the above crimes for a long time. Last year, he began to surrender to the government and confess the above crimes, and handed over a pistol. Cheng Pengjiu, a special agent sent to Wuhan by the Macau intelligence group of the puppet Ministry of National Defense in April 1956, was assigned the task of collecting the stationing numbers, quantity, and names of the leaders of the land and air forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Wuhan. When he was sent to Wuhan, he witnessed the leap-forward development of the socialist construction cause in the motherland, the new atmosphere, and the government's lenient policies. He was moved by the encouragement of his wife and children, and finally surrendered to the government in June of the same year and thoroughly confessed his lurking mission. The Municipal People's Procuratorate deemed that Cheng Pengjiu had not engaged in counter-revolutionary activities after lurking, and was determined to repent and rehabilitate, exempted him from criminal prosecution, and announced that he would not be regarded as a counter-revolutionary element, and was given lenient treatment. In 1956, with the development of the national construction cause, due consideration was given to counter-revolutionary elements who were unemployed and had employment opportunities, and they were given employment and found a way out of life. According to statistics in Wuhan as of the end of August last year, more than 1,300 people were introduced to employment. In rural areas, landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements were also received as members or probationary members in the cooperative for the most part who performed well, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 4 and 5 of the National Agricultural Development Program, and under the principle of mass evaluation, examination, and consent, and according to their production and law-abiding performance. Those who performed poorly and were not agreed to by the masses were also supervised by the cooperative in their production. As for the very few elements who continued to resolutely be enemies of the people and refused to be reformed despite repeated education, they were arrested and punished in accordance with the law. After these people were planned to join the cooperative, the agricultural cooperatives gave them the income they deserved for their labor in accordance with the principle of "distribution according to work." Doing so once again specifically embodied the government's lenient policy and promoted them to truly become self-reliant laborers.

　　Shortcomings in work need to be overcome
　　In short, the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries is correct, and the achievements made are enormous. However, while affirming the achievements, we must also see that there are still some shortcomings and errors in the implementation of the central government's established policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. The work of our public security, procuratorial, and judicial organs still has bureaucracy and subjectivism. In addition, the cadre's policy level is not high, so some of the cases handled are rough and of insufficient quality. A few people who should not have been arrested were arrested, and there were also individual cases of wrongful arrest that caused miscarriages of justice. For example, in the case of Liu Shaobin, who was arrested in Wuhan (already rehabilitated), only according to the report that "Liu had served as the head of a Japanese puppet army battalion, a reactionary township chief, and committed crimes such as arresting and killing Comrade Zhang Minghui, the township chief of the New Fourth Army," although investigations were made in advance with the informant and the place where the incident occurred, the masses provided that there was indeed Liu Battalion Commander, who had done many evil deeds. It was only during the pre-trial after the arrest that it was discovered that Liu Shaobin had been engaged in business all along. He promptly conducted an in-depth investigation of the materials and learned that the informant did not know Liu Battalion Commander either, resulting in a wrongful injury to good people. Another example is the case of Zhou Sen. The original basis for the arrest was that he shielded his counter-revolutionary brother Zhou Xin (a puppet township chief, who had been arrested). Zhou Sen and his younger brother had jointly set up a tomb and claimed that Zhou Xin was dead, deceiving and confusing the masses. He also shielded the fugitive counter-revolutionary Tang Rongfa and his brother-in-law Pan Yueting (currently under control). After the arrest, it was confirmed during the pre-trial that the fact that he shielded the counter-revolutionary Zhou Xin was true, but he confessed and explained it in the Five-Anti Movement, and the court sentenced him to one year of control, which was dealt with and could no longer be regarded as a crime. Shielding Tang Rongfa was done by Tang's nephew, and Zhou Sen did not know that Tang was a fugitive counter-revolutionary. He had a close relationship with his brother-in-law Pan Yueting, but it could not be regarded as shielding, and no political relationship was found. These cases do reflect that our investigation and research were not thorough enough, and there were shortcomings in the instability of policy implementation. Although the wrongful cases were individual, and inspections were carried out and rehabilitated in a timely manner, they brought undue losses to the Party and the government politically and should be taken as a lesson.

　　While inspecting and correcting the shortcomings and errors in the anti-counterrevolutionary work, we must also repeatedly explain clearly to the cadres and the masses, and comprehensively implement the policy of "eradicating all counter-revolutionaries and correcting all mistakes," and resolutely prevent another aspect of deviation--disarming the cadres and the masses ideologically. I have heard this kind of ideological reflection from the cadres: "The more you do, the more mistakes you make, the less you do, the fewer mistakes you make, and if you don't do anything, you won't make any mistakes." This is not right. But it also shows that we are not doing enough to comprehensively explain the policy of "eradicating all counter-revolutionaries and correcting all mistakes" when we check the cases of wrongful arrest and wrongful judgment. As mentioned earlier, the resolute counter-revolutionary elements, although they are a minority, their sabotage activities are more dangerous and cunning. Therefore, continuing to strengthen and improve the education on revolutionary vigilance is still a very important political and ideological work. We must never become complacent and complacent because there are only a few counter-revolutionary elements. We still need to carry out active and in-depth arduous work, grasp the spirit of "eradicating all counter-revolutionaries and correcting all mistakes," until all counter-revolutionaries are completely eliminated, so as to ensure that the great cause of socialist construction has good order.

    全面贯彻“有反必肃，有错必纠”的方针
　　路耀林谈湖北省肃清反革命的工作
    我列席这次会议，听了毛主席在最高国务会议上关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题的指示，周总理访问欧洲亚洲十一个国家的报告，陈叔通副主席关于政协常务委员会的工作报告。经过小组讨论，思想有了很大提高，并保证将此次会议精神认真地贯彻到工作中去。今天仅就有关镇压反革命分子的情况和存在的问题，发表个人的一些意见。
    镇压反革命的方针是正确的
    首先，我认为1955年开展第二次镇压反革命运动是完全必要的。我们记得1954年和1955年上半年，湖北地区和武汉市内的敌人，曾一度利用了洪水灾害后的严重困难，利用了我们国家机关及工作人员的右倾麻痹思想，他们在推行粮食统购统销、发行新人民币、征集兵员等中心工作的时候，活动极为嚣张。制造反动谣言，煽惑群众，企图引起社会秩序混乱，借以实现其反革命破坏目的。如造谣说“今年（1955年）的大水比去年还高五尺”，孝感地区谣言“过阴兵”，不少地区制造匪情，群众虚赶“土匪”，参加人数少者数十人多到千余人，影响群众生产。与此同时，美蒋特务机关派遣来的特务分子，漏网的残余反革命分子，伪军政警宪中的反动分子以及农村中少数屡教不改的反动地主阶级分子，也开始了直接的破坏活动。如反革命分子张博斋（已处死刑），曾任过保长、联保主任、第五战区军警督察处督察长，均县解放时他逃到汉口，全国解放后，长期隐蔽并进行破坏活动，曾刻制光化县第四区公所和仁义乡政府公章两枚，伪造证件，流窜于江西、湖南、湖北、河南、河北等省。他竟于1954年9月27日全国人民代表大会召开之际，在武汉码头上呼喊反动口号，企图散发已写好的反动标语。又如反革命分子郑际云（已捕），当1954年武汉全市人民与洪水搏斗紧张困难时，郑犯在汉阳堤上，煽动修堤民工三十余人逃跑，严重影响了堤防任务的完成。再如1956年3月武汉市公安局破获的间谍分子焦志彬案，焦匪早于1951年至1954年被派遣前，曾在台湾接受伪国防部二厅的特务间谍训练，1956年潜入武汉混入天化工厂后，搜集我人民解放军驻武汉空军战斗机训练、探照灯的分布、军用仓库方位等军事情况，用密写寄给特务机关，焦匪自认为条件已经成熟，向特务机关索要电台（已缴获），准备长期潜伏，破坏社会主义建设。再从我国家机关、团体、学校和工厂企业内部的敌情看，也是相当严重的。仅就湖北省第一批开展肃反运动的单位，约已查证属实，定为反革命分子和其他坏分子即达二千七百八十四名，占参加第一批肃反运动总人数的1.79％。已混入内部的反革命分子虽然是极少的，但破坏和危害的情形是极大的。如武汉钢铁公司查出的反革命分子郭际光，混入武钢当上了绘图员，曾利用职务便利，有意破坏武钢建设，将该厂建设地形图修改标高十九处，幸早发觉未酿成严重损失。另据在武汉地区十四所大专学校一千多名的高级知识分子中，查出反革命分子和其他坏分子三十三名，从性质看：特务间谍五名，反动党团骨干十六名，伪军政警宪分子中的反动分子六名，地主恶霸分子三名，其他分子三名。
    以上这些情况，足以证明：反革命分子是存在的，我们的敌人并未睡觉，而且采取的斗争方法与手段更加隐蔽和狡猾，相反的，我们国家机关干部滋长着轻敌麻痹思想，一时放松了对敌打击。因此，群众向我们提出批评，武汉市江岸区一个群众曾以“在总路线照耀下，检举处理反革命分子的错误”为题，向市人民检察院反映，批评我们对反革命分子处理上有右倾思想和对敌斗争不力的现象；江汉区一个群众到公安派出所质问“政府的眼又瞎了”。因此，各地根据第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上，关于发展国民经济第一个五年计划的决议中“各级国家机关和全国人民必须充分地提高革命的警惕性，肃清一切公开的和暗藏的反革命分子，粉碎国内外敌人对我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的破坏活动”的精神，因而不论从敌人的破坏活动和人民群众的要求看都是完全正确的。正由于采取了坚决有力的措施，对我国社会主义三大改造事业的进行，创造了有利的条件。我认为这是1955年以来开展第二镇反工作的主要成绩和基本方面。
    1955年以来的镇反工作，基本上是深入细致的，是在调查研究的基础上进行的。贯彻执行“专门机关和广大群众相结合”的路线和“镇压与宽大相结合”的镇反方针政策，都更加具体了，特别是社会主义三大高潮的新形势影响下，残余反革命分子日益孤立，大势所趋，也有了新的变化，反革命分子内部开始了分化和瓦解。不少的人愿意从新作人，靠拢政府和人民，同时政府也给了他们更为宽大的悔改机会，反革命分子也只有向人民政府自首坦白彻底交待所作罪恶，尚能获得人民的谅解和政府的宽大处理。武汉市1956年元——9月份的统计，向公安机关自首坦白交待罪恶的反革命分子有八百一十三名。检察、法院、公安机关及时地根据他们坦白的真实程度，严格依照“坦白从宽、抗拒从严、立功折罪、立大功受奖”的政策，分别给了宽大处理。如反革命分子张培，解放前为匪，到处抢劫民财，解放后曾在河南唐县，夺抢杀害该县八区区政府秘书、炊事员等两同志后，化名张华甫逃来武汉，长期隐瞒上述罪恶，去年始向政府自首坦白了以上罪恶，并交出手枪一只。伪国防部二厅澳门情报组，1956年4月份派遣来武汉的特务分子程鹏九，接受特务任务是搜集驻武汉地区中国人民解放军陆、空军驻地番号、数量和首长姓名等，遣来汉由于目击祖国社会主义建设事业飞跃发展，新的气象和政府宽大政策感召下，加之妻子和子女积极规劝，终于同年6月向政府自首彻底交代潜伏任务。市人民检察院鉴程鹏九潜来后没有进行反革命活动，且有悔过自新的决心，免予追究刑事，并宣布不以反革命分子论，获得了宽大处理。1956年，随着国家建设事业的发展，对无业且有就业的反革命分子也给了应有的照顾，安插其职业，找到了生活出路。据武汉市在去年到8月底的统计，介绍就业的有一千三百余人。农村中的地主、富农和反革命分子，亦根据全国农业发展纲要四、五两条的规定，按照他们的生产和守法的表现好坏，经群众评比审查同意的原则下，绝大部分表现好的接收为社员或候补社员，对于表现不好，群众不同意的，也交合作社监督其生产，至于继续坚决与人民为敌屡教不改的极少数分子，依法逮捕予以制裁。这些人规划入社后，农业合作社都依照“按劳取酬”的原则，给予了劳动应得收入。这样做，再一次具体地体现了政府的宽大政策，促使他们真正成为自食其力的劳动者。
      工作中的缺点需要克服
    总之镇反方针是正确的，所取得的成绩是巨大的，但在肯定成绩的同时，我们还要看到在执行中央镇反既定方针政策上也还存在着一些缺点错误。我们的公安、检察、法院机关的工作还有官僚主义和主观主义，加之干部政策水平不高，因而办理的某些案件有粗糙和质量不够高的现象，少数不该捕的捕了，也有个别的错捕造成了冤狱的事件，如武汉市逮捕的刘少彬案（已平反）只根据检举材料说“刘曾任过日伪军营长、乡长反动职务，抓捕杀害了新四军乡长张明辉同志等罪恶”，虽然事先向检举人和出事地点作过调查，群众提供了确有刘营长这个人，作恶多端。逮捕后预审中始发觉刘少彬一直经营生意为业，及时深入查对材料，始知检举人也不认识刘营长这个人，结果误伤了好人。又如周森的案件，原逮捕根据，包庇反革命哥哥周鑫（伪乡长，已逮捕），周森曾伙同弟弟假设坟墓，扬言周鑫已死，欺骗迷惑群众，还包庇逃亡反革命唐荣法，内弟潘岳廷（现管制）等材料，逮捕后，预审时证实包庇反革命分子周鑫是事实，但在五反运动中坦白交代，法院判管制一年，作了处理，不能再以犯罪论。包庇唐荣法系唐侄所为，周森确不知唐是逃亡反革命，与其内弟潘岳廷关系甚密，但不能算作包庇，也未发现有政治关系。诸如这些案件，确也反映出我们的调查研究作得还是不够深入，和执行政策上有不稳的缺点，虽然错案是个别的，且作过检查及时平反了，但给党和政府在政治上带来了不应有的损失，应引为教训。
    我们在检查纠正肃反工作中的缺点错误的同时，也必须反复向干部和群众讲解清楚，全面地贯彻“有反必肃，有错必纠”的方针，切要防止另一方面的偏向——解除了干部和群众的思想武装，我已听到干部中有这种的思想反映“多做多错，少做少错，不做不错”的论调，这是不对的。但也说明我们在检查错捕错判的案件时，注意全面地交代“有反必肃，有错必纠”的方针，还是做的不够。前面说过了，坚决的反革命分子，虽然是少数的，但破坏活动更加险恶狡猾了，因此继续加强提高革命警惕性的教育，仍然是一项十分重要的政治思想工作。绝对不能因为只有少数的反革命分子，而麻痹高枕无忧了，仍然需要作积极深入地进行艰苦的工作，掌握“有反必肃，有错必纠”的精神，直到全部彻底肃清反革命为止，以确保社会主义伟大建设事业有良好秩序。（附图片）
