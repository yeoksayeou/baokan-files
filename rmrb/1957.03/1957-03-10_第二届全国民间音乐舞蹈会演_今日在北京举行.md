    第二届全国民间音乐舞蹈会演
    今日在北京举行
    本报讯　第二届全国民间音乐舞蹈会演今日开始在北京举行。这次会演的目的，主要是为了发掘与继承民间艺术的优秀遗产，丰富群众艺术活动节目，并了解农业合作化以后农村群众业余艺术活动开展的新面貌。参加会演的有二十七个代表团，约一千一百人。自从1956年9月，文化部、民族事务委员会、全国总工会、青年团中央四个单位联合发出关于会演的通知后，各省、自治区、直辖市都积极展开筹备工作。各地群众艺术馆在文化局直接领导下，配合文化馆以及专业歌舞团的一些干部，曾到各地进行深入的调查和全面挖掘，并分别举行乡、区、省的会演，最后选拔出优秀节目和人才，组成代表团来京。如湖南省在1956年两个多月里曾发掘出一万多个节目，现在选择其中的二十几个参加全国会演。全国绝大多数的省份都分别在去年年末或今年年初举行了省的会演。据各地反映，我国民间的音乐舞蹈艺术真是百花齐放，采色缤纷。
    这次演出从3月10日起到3月22日止，共有十五个不同节目的晚会；每天在天桥剧场、工人俱乐部同时演出。为了满足首都观众的要求，这次会演采用观摩与公演相结合的办法，每天售出一定数量的票，最后还选拔一批优秀节目公演三、四场。　（晓零）
