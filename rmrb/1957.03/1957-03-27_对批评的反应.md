Reactions to Criticism

    Tea Ka Salt Factory's Production Target Reduced
    A letter from the Salt Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Food Industry states: We sincerely accept the criticism in the article "Why Continue to Waste?" published on the second page of the People's Daily. However, the waste due to the stockpiling of tea ka salt has certain objective reasons. When submitting the 1957 production control figures, our bureau had already reduced the production target of the tea ka salt factory from 70,000 tons to 20,000 tons based on various factors.

    Overcoming the Shortcoming of Not Dispatching Vehicles on Time
    A letter from the Transportation Bureau of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Transportation states: The article "Many Malpractices in Guangdong Transportation Department" published on the second page of the People's Daily on November 25th of last year is a correct criticism of our bureau. Our bureau will learn from past lessons and public opinion, and in the future, will earnestly overcome the past shortcoming of not dispatching vehicles on time by improving the quality of vehicle repairs, strengthening scheduling work, closely contacting material units, and strictly implementing vehicle loading plans.

    Attaching Importance to Preparatory Work for New Product Production
    A letter from the Tianjin Sino-Private Joint Venture Qixing Photographic Equipment Manufacturing Factory states: The article "Waste Created by Tianjin Qixing Photographic Equipment Factory" published in the People's Daily on November 27th of last year, criticizing our factory for neglecting preparatory work before the production of new products, resulting in significant waste, is entirely correct. We have conducted inspections and summaries, and have formulated methods and systems for future new product production to ensure the smooth introduction of new products into production.

    Deviations in Piece-Rate Wage Payments Corrected
    A letter from the Local State-Owned Nanyang Silk Weaving Factory states: The article "Unacceptable Experience" published in the People's Daily on March 1st is essentially a correct criticism of the unreasonable form of wage payment in our factory's piece-rate regulations.
    Currently, our factory has organized a team to measure and revise the piece-rate targets to address the unreasonable phenomenon.

    Fully Utilizing Dye Water
    A letter from the Suzhou Dyeing Production Cooperative states: The article "Colorful River Water" published on page five of the People's Daily on March 10th is a completely correct criticism of our cooperative. This criticism has profound educational significance for us in carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy. In the future, we plan to use vats to hold the usable dye water and make full use of it, while also renovating the drainage ditches to discharge water, gradually ensuring that nearby residents are not affected when washing clothes and rice.

    "Unreasonable Reward System" Revised
    A letter from the Labor and Wage Department of the Anshan Metallurgical Construction General Company states: The article "Unreasonable Reward System" on the second page of the People's Daily on January 25th is a correct criticism of us. The reward system for engineering and technical personnel and staff members of our company in 1956 was implemented in accordance with the "Provisional Reward Measures for Leading Personnel, Engineering and Technical Personnel, and Staff Members of Construction and Installation Enterprises for Completing and Overfulfilling Tasks" promulgated by the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. From the current actual situation, this reward system is not reasonable enough. The Construction Bureau has already revised it starting from the third quarter of 1956.

### 对批评的反应

专栏：对批评的反应

　　对批评的反应
    茶卡盐厂生产任务已减少
    食品工业部盐务总局来信说：人民日报第二版发表“为什么还要继续浪费下去”一文的批评，我局诚恳地接受。但茶卡盐积压的浪费，是有其一定客观原因的。我局在提出1957年生产控制数字的时候，已根据各方面的情况将茶卡盐厂生产任务从七万吨减为两万吨。
    克服不按时派车的缺点
    广东省交通厅运输局来信说：去年11月25日人民日报二版发表
  “广东运输部门陋规多”一文，对我局的批评是正确的。我局当接受过去的教训和群众意见，今后切实从提高车辆修理质量，加强调度工作，密切联系物资单位，严格执行装车计划等方面，来克服过去不按时派车的缺点。
    重视新产品生产的准备工作
    天津市公私合营七星摄影器材制造厂来信说：人民日报去年11月27日发表“天津七星摄影器材厂造成浪费”一文，批评我厂忽视新产品生产前的准备工作，造成重大浪费，是完全正确的。我们已进行检查总结，并订出今后新品种生产的办法与制度，以保证新品种顺利投入生产。
　  计件工资支付中的偏差已纠正
    地方国营南阳丝织厂来信说：人民日报3月1日发表的“要不得的经验”一文，对我厂在计件规程中不合理的支付工资形式的批评，基本上是正确的。
    目前我厂已组织力量进行测定修改计件指标，以解决其不合理现象。
    充分利用颜料水
    苏州市炼染生产合作社来信说：人民日报3月10日五版刊载“五颜六色的河水”一文，对我社的批评是完全正确的。这一批评对我们开展增产节约运动有深刻的教育意义。今后我们准备把可以利用的颜料水用缸盛起来，充分加以利用，同时翻修阴沟排泄出水，逐步作到不使附近居民洗衣、淘米受到影响。
  　“不合理的奖励制度”已修改
    鞍山冶金建筑总公司劳动工资处来信说：人民日报1月25日二版“不合理的奖励制度”一文，对我们的批评是对的。我公司1956年度工程技术人员与职员的奖励制度是根据冶金工业部建筑局所颁发的“建筑安装企业领导人员、工程技术人员、职员完成与提前完成任务试行奖励办法”的规定执行的，从当前的实际情况来看，这个奖励制度是不够合理的。从1956年第三季度起，建筑局已经对此作了修改。
