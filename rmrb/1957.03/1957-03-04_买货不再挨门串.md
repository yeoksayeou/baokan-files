Based on the overall plan for arranging the distribution of non-staple food stores, the Hebei District of Tianjin established several new non-staple food general stores in late January at Guangfu Road, Zhouwei Road Simalu, Huangwei Road Ermalu, and Yuchang Street. These general stores are very popular with consumers. Everyone says: General stores have a full range of products, so you no longer have to run around "door to door" to buy groceries. Liu Zhimin, who lives on Riwei Road, said: "In the past, buying fish and meat required going to the Huangwei Road Ermalu market, buying general merchandise required going to Zhongshan Road, and buying pastries required going to the North Station, which took one or two hours back and forth. Now, one general store sells vegetables, seasonings, fish, meat, etc., and it doesn't take long to buy everything."

The reason why general stores are so popular with consumers is obvious. It is because they are closest to the consumers, especially for some housewives, who can buy all the necessities they need for the day by going to one general store. However, some local commercial departments often consider how to meet the requirements of economic accounting and business management when setting up commercial networks and arranging various types of stores, and consider less how to facilitate consumer purchases, so that some stores that should not be specialized are also specialized. Consumers have to run from one place to another to buy daily necessities.

The store closest to the consumer is the store most welcomed by the consumer, and also the store most concerned by the consumer. In the opinion books of these new general stores in Hebei District of Tianjin, customers often offer suggestions and criticisms on various aspects of the store's work with a caring attitude. These suggestions and criticisms from consumers are very valuable for the store to improve its work, so whether it is to facilitate consumer purchases or to improve the store's operation and management, the closer the store is to the consumer, the better.

    买货不再挨门串
    天津市河北区根据全面安排副食品商业网的规划，1月下旬在光复路、宙纬路四马路、黄纬路二马路、于厂大街等四处新设立了几个副食品综合商店。这些综合商店很受消费者的欢迎。大家都说：综合商店品种齐全，买菜再也用不着东奔西跑“挨门串”了。住在日纬路的刘治民说：“过去买鱼肉要到黄纬路二马路菜市，买点百货得去中山路，买糕点得上北站，来回一两个钟头。现在一家综合商店，蔬菜、调料、鱼肉等等都卖，用不了多长时间就能把东西买齐。”
    综合商店之所以很受消费者欢迎，道理是很明显的。因为它最接近消费者，尤其对一些主妇来说，走一家综合商店就可以买回一天所需要的必需品。但是，有些地方的商业部门在商业网的设置和各种不同类型的商店的摆布上，往往在如何符合经济核算的要求和业务上的领导管理这方面考虑得较多一些，在如何方便消费者购买这点上考虑得少一点，以至把一些不应当实行专业化的商店也专业化了。消费者买一点日用品就得走东家跑西家的挨门串。
    最接近消费者的商店是消费者最欢迎的商店，也是消费者最关心的商店。天津市河北区新设立的这些综合商店的意见簿上，就经常有顾客以关怀的态度对商店各方面的工作提出建议和批评。这些来自消费者的建议和批评，对商店改进工作是很宝贵的，所以，无论从方便消费者购买，或是对改善商店的经营管理来说，商店离消费者越近越好。
