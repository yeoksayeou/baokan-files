Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch: Vice Premier of the State Council, Li Xiannian, gave important instructions on the 4th, regarding current grain purchase, sales, allocation, and increased production and conservation, to all cadres attending the National Conference of Grain Bureau Directors.

	Li Xiannian first stated that, up to now, the grain procurement task for the 1956 fiscal year has been about 93% completed, and it is expected that this year's procurement task can be completed. He pointed out that the grain procurement tasks in most provinces in the rice-producing areas have been completed or overfulfilled, but in the coarse grain areas, with the exception of Shandong, Hebei, Henan, and other provinces, other provinces have not yet completed their tasks, which affects the national balance in grain varieties. Li Xiannian then criticized the blindly optimistic attitude of some grain work cadres who believed that the grain problem had been solved after agricultural cooperation. He believes that the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain must continue to be implemented in order to maintain and consolidate the stability of the grain situation. Regarding this year's grain purchase work, Li Xiannian pointed out that all areas that have not completed the grain procurement task must seize the time and strive to complete it; all areas that have completed the grain procurement task should strive to overfulfill the task if possible. At the same time, he believes that the grain purchase work in the future should reiterate the order of grain distribution in agricultural production cooperatives. According to the provisions of the "three fix" policy, grain should be distributed according to the principle of "public before private" on the condition of ensuring that agricultural cooperatives and their members retain the necessary grain, that is, first complete the state-approved grain procurement task, and then carry out reasonable distribution within the cooperative. The regulation that 40% of the increased grain production in bumper harvest areas should be purchased should be implemented. The grain retention standards stipulated by various localities when implementing the "three fix" grain policy shall not be raised arbitrarily, and other relevant provisions of the "three fix" policy must be resolutely implemented.

	Li Xiannian pointed out that although grain sales have been rectified, they are still a matter of concern. According to the statistics of the Ministry of Food, from July 1956 to February 1957, the state sold a total of 10.3 billion jin more grain than in the same period from July 1955 to February 1956. In addition to the reasonable increase in sales needed to support disaster areas, increase pig breeding, and reasonably increase the population in urban industrial and mining areas, it is estimated that a considerable portion of the grain is an unreasonable increase in sales. At present, although the state's grain reserves are more abundant than in previous years, there are imbalances in variety and region. Therefore, from March to June this year, grain sales must be strictly controlled according to the national plan to ensure reasonable supply and must not be relaxed casually, and emphasis must be placed on saving grain.

    李先念谈当前粮食统购统销工作
    据新华社6日讯　国务院副总理李先念在4日就当前粮食收购、销售、调度和增产节约问题，向出席全国粮食厅局长会议的全体干部作了重要指示。
    李先念首先说，到目前为止，1956年度的粮食征购任务已经完成93％左右，预计本年度的征购任务是可以完成的。他指出，大米地区的大多数省份的粮食征购任务都已完成或超额完成，但杂粮地区除山东、河北、河南等省以外，其他各省尚未完成，这就影响到国家粮食品种上的平衡。李先念接着批判了某些粮食工作干部认为农业合作化后粮食问题已经获得解决的盲目乐观情绪，他认为，必须继续贯彻执行粮食统购统销政策，以继续保持和巩固粮食局势的稳定。关于本年度的粮食收购工作，李先念指出，现在凡是没有完成粮食征购任务的地区，都必须抓紧时间，努力完成；凡是已经完成粮食征购任务的地区，只要有可能，都应该争取超额完成任务。同时他认为，今后的粮食收购工作应当重申农业生产合作社粮食分配的次序，必须根据三定政策的规定，保证农业社和社员必需留粮的条件下，按“先公后私”的原则分配粮食，这就是先完成国家核定的粮食征购任务，然后再在社内进行合理分配；应当贯彻执行对丰收地区增产的粮食增购40％的规定；各地实行粮食“三定”时候规定的留粮标准，不得随意提高，其它三定政策的有关规定必须坚决执行。
    李先念指出，目前粮食销售虽经整顿，但还是值得重视的问题。根据粮食部的统计，从1956年7月到1957年2月这八个月中，比1955年7月到1956年2月同一期间，国家共多销售一百零三亿斤粮食，其中除了支援灾区、增养生猪和城市工矿区人口合理增加而必须合理增销的部分以外，估计有相当一部分粮食是不合理的增销。目前，国家粮食库存力量虽比往年雄厚，但由于品种上和地区上存在着不平衡现象，因此今年从3月到6月粮食销售，必须按照国家计划，严格掌握，保证合理供应，不得随便放松供应，并且要强调节约粮食。
