Xinhua News Agency, March 28th. The National Mass Art Center Work Symposium, which concluded in Beijing yesterday, believes that the mass art center is an art institution responsible for conducting professional research and guidance on mass amateur art activities; its task is to enrich the content of mass art activities and improve their quality.

This symposium determined the four tasks that the mass art center will carry out in the future: collecting and organizing folk art heritage, guiding mass amateur creation; supplying mass singing materials and professional learning materials; training cultural center art cadres and mass amateur art activity backbones; and organizing social forces to guide mass amateur art organizations.

The symposium emphasized that implementing the mass line is the fundamental working method of the mass art center.

There is now a central mass art center, twenty-six provincial, autonomous region, and directly administered municipal centers, and six municipal-level centers. Although these mass art centers were established not long ago (the earliest was established in 1955), they have made some achievements in carrying out local mass amateur art activities and collecting folk art heritage.

This symposium was convened by the Art Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture on the 23rd.

　　丰富和提高群众艺术活动
　　全国群众艺术馆工作座谈会在京举行
    新华社28日讯  昨天在北京结束的全国群众艺术馆工作座谈会认为，群众艺术馆是负责对群众业余艺术活动进行业务研究和指导的艺术事业机构；它的任务是丰富群众艺术活动的内容，提高质量。
    这次座谈会确定了群众艺术馆今后将要进行的四项工作：搜集和整理民间艺术遗产，辅导群众业余创作；供应群众演唱材料和业务学习资料；训练文化馆艺术干部和群众业余艺术活动骨干；组织社会力量对群众业余艺术组织进行辅导。
    座谈会强调提出，贯彻群众路线是群众艺术馆的根本性的工作方法。
    现在全国已有一个中央群众艺术馆，二十六个省、自治区和直辖市馆，还有六个省辖市馆。这些群众艺术馆虽然建立不久（最早在1955年建馆），但是在开展当地群众业余艺术活动和搜集民间艺术遗产等工作方面已经作出一定成绩。
    这次座谈会是文化部艺术事业管理局在23日召开的。
