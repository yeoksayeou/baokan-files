　　"Ignoring" and "Unable to Manage"
　　Tang Ning
    Since the latter half of last year, a disconnect has emerged in the Ji'an Special District of Jiangxi Province between the supply and marketing cooperatives "ignoring" and the handicraft cooperatives "unable to manage" the supply of old-style farm tools and small agricultural implements, seriously affecting the supply of small agricultural implements during the spring plowing season.

    Some local supply and marketing cooperatives believe that since the handicraft cooperatives have implemented "self-production, self-sales," the supply and marketing cooperatives have no responsibility, and they have adopted an attitude of indifference toward the supply of old-style farm tools and small agricultural implements. Handicraft cooperatives, due to limited funds and insufficient understanding of rural needs, generally produce whatever products sell well, paying little attention to the overall needs. At the end of December last year, the two ironware cooperatives in Taihe Town had no farm tools in stock; the iron and woodwork cooperatives in Zhixia, Tangdong, and Futian in Ji'an County were busy making profitable furniture and dowries around the Spring Festival and had no farm tools in reserve. In mid-February this year, Jishui County inspected the reserve situation of eleven kinds of spring plowing farm tools in the county's handicraft cooperatives, such as paddy field plows, iron rakes, and hoes, and found only more than 9,900 pieces, which was more than 13,400 pieces short of the actual needs below. The Baisha District Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Handicraft Cooperative had a total of only four hoes, ten rolling rakes, one large iron rake, two five-toothed grass rakes, and five harrow rakes in iron farm implements; other urgently needed ironware was simply not available. According to estimates from these relevant departments, the reserve of old-style farm tools and small agricultural implements in the entire district is less than half of last year's to date. According to the pattern of previous years, 60% of the total number of spring plowing farm tools should be reserved in the winter of the previous year in order to meet market needs in the spring. This "ignoring" and "unable to manage" attitude of the Ji'an Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative and Handicraft Cooperative has brought an extremely tense situation to this year's farm implement supply work.

    In January, the Ji'an Prefectural Commissioner's Office began to correct this deviation, and some local supply and marketing cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives are jointly solving this problem. However, many areas still hold the attitude of "ignoring" and "unable to manage," which needs to be quickly and thoroughly reversed in order to do a good job in this year's supply of means of production.

　　“不管了”和“管不了”
　　唐宁
    自从去年下半年以来，江西吉安专区在旧式农具和小农具的供应上出现了供销社“不管了”，手工业社“管不了”的脱节局面，严重地影响了春耕生产期间小农具的供应工作。
    有些地方的供销社认为，手工业社已经实行了“自产、自销”，供销社没有责任了，他们就对旧式农具和小农具的供应工作抱着不理不问的态度。手工业社因为资金不多，对农村的需要了解不够，一般都是什么产品行销，就生产什么，对总的需要情况不大注意。去年12月底，泰和城镇两个铁业社，库存农具一点都没有；吉安县值夏、塘东、富田等地的铁器、木器社，春节前后一直都在赶打赚钱的家具和嫁妆，也没有储备一点农具。今年2月中旬，吉水县检查了全县手工业社的十一种春耕农具的储备情形，如水田犁、铁耙、锄头等才有九千九百多件，和下面的实际需要相差一万三千四百多件；白沙区供销社和手工业社，铁制农具合计起来才有四把锄头、十张滚耙、一张大铁耙、两张五齿草耙、五把钉耙，其它急需的铁器根本没有。据这些有关部门的估计，全区旧式农具和小农具的储备，到目前为止还不及去年的半数。按照历年的规律，在头一年冬季就应该储备春耕农具总数的60％，到春季才能满足市场的需要。吉安专区供销社和手工业社这种“不管了”与“管不了”的态度，给今年的农具供应工作，带来了分外紧张的局势。
    1月间，吉安专署已经开始纠正这种偏向，有些地区的供销社和手工业社正在联合解决这个问题。但是不少地区仍然抱着“不管了”和“管不了”的态度，需要赶快彻底扭转，才能做好今年的生产资料供应工作。
