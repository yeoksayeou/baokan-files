    Elephant Graveyard
    Tan Bangjie

    After traversing thousands of mountains and rivers, and enduring countless hardships, one day, an explorer lost in the vast forest came to such a place: hidden behind the primeval forest was a secluded valley where no human footprint had ever been seen. The explorer, dragging his exhausted body, climbed to the top of the valley, wanting to find a place to rest. The sky had darkened, and the surroundings were silent, the bright moon slowly rising over the mountains. Suddenly, the moonlight illuminated the valley, and the explorer, sitting on the craggy cliff, suddenly saw countless ivory tusks and giant bones piled up like mountains in the valley below, emitting a pale, ghostly light under the clear, water-like radiance. Everything seemed like a dream, the "elephant graveyard" he had dreamed of day and night, now actually appeared before his eyes. The explorer couldn't help but shout, "I found it!"
    Found it? Is it real?
    Since ancient times, countless explorers, travelers, hunters, or other kinds of "ists," harboring the same extravagant hope, have traversed the forests and wildernesses of Africa and Southeast Asia, dreaming of one day becoming the first discoverer of the "elephant graveyard," thus becoming immensely wealthy and famous throughout the world. But hundreds of years have passed, and who has truly become a discoverer? Not a single one.
    Perhaps this legend is too enticing. I saw an article in the February 1st issue of "New Observer" that mentioned a similar legend existing among the people of Xishuangbanna. In any case, this is very interesting, and it shows that in all elephant-producing regions, whether Chinese or foreign, there are almost always such legends. Moreover, they are passed down from father to son, generation after generation, but no one has ever seen it with their own eyes.
    According to the legend, when elephants reach old age, they can foresee their impending demise. And because the elephant clan also has a "cemetery," no matter how far away they are, they must return to it to die there. Over the centuries, elephant tusks and bones have naturally piled up like mountains there, and whoever discovers it will naturally be as lucky as someone who discovers a gold mine in a story.
    Unfortunately, the legend adds a few more sentences: the location of the "elephant graveyard" is in a place that no one can find, only dying old elephants can find it; moreover, if someone accidentally approaches, there will be "elephant spirits" or mountain goblins, strange beasts, and the like to stop them. In this way, it adds a lot of mystery and also provides an explanation for not being able to find the place.
    In fact, no matter how you say it, it is difficult to be self-consistent. The legend may be beautiful, but it loses its persuasiveness in the face of science. Spirits or mountain goblins are certainly absurd. Are elephants smarter than humans? Can they find a place that humans cannot find? Even if it is said that there are still a very few places in the heart of the African continent that have not been marked by human footprints, what about in India, Burma, Malaysia, and other densely populated places? What about in the coastal areas of East and South Africa? For thousands of years, what kind of smokescreen has maintained the existence of these "elephant graveyards"? If you think carefully, it is not difficult to see through the fictitious nature of the legend.
    But at the same time, some questions exist, such as: why do people rarely find the large tusks of dead elephants? Why are elephant carcasses so rarely seen?
    Now let me try to answer.
    People familiar with the life of elephant herds all know that elephant herds have strong mobility, often moving dozens or even hundreds of miles on weekdays. This is because their appetite is particularly large (each one needs about five or six hundred pounds of tender branches, buds, and fresh grass every day), and no jungle or grassland can provide for a large group of elephants for a long time. Old male elephants find it increasingly difficult to keep up, and because their temper becomes more and more eccentric, they are difficult to get along with in the group, so they gradually become estranged from the elephant herd, and one day they completely break away (or maybe they are driven away). Local legends all say that old elephants go to die alone, this observation is correct, because elephants always live in solitude in their later years.
    Since the lonely old elephant cannot travel far and its body is weakening, it has to find a secluded place with the deepest grass, the densest forest, and the farthest away from human habitation to hide. Such places are mostly low-lying areas not far from the river, in order to facilitate food and water. One day, its end finally comes. Perhaps it dies in a tropical downpour, perhaps it dies in a river flood. In this way, its bones are scattered by the flood, or sink into the silt. Even if it does not sink in this way, the tropics have groups of various scavengers (hyenas, jackals, vultures, etc.), and in a day or two they will clean up the remains. Even its bones and tusks are likely to be visited, because there are many porcupines in the tropics (commonly known as quill pigs), who specialize in gnawing on such objects.
    Will there be any ungnawed ivory tusks left? Maybe. But paleontologists will tell you: it is difficult to find much fossil material in the tropics. The climate there is so hot, the rainfall is so high, the soil is so humid, the corrosive effect is so great, even ivory cannot remain intact for a long time, let alone grow slowly in the soil (a counter-intuitive statement)! You must know that this is not Siberia. The mammoths (ancient giant elephants) found in Siberia's "natural freezer" not only have complete bones and teeth, but even the meat and hair are still intact, and its "frozen" period has been more than 10,000 years! But do mammoths have a fixed "graveyard"? No, they don't.

    象的墓场
    谭邦杰
    跋涉了千山万水，经历了千辛万苦，终于有一日，在大森林中迷了途的探险家来到这样一处地方：隐藏在原始大森林后面的是亘古未曾有过人迹的幽谷。探险家拖着疲劳不堪的身体爬上谷巅，想找块地方休息休息。天色已暗，四野万籁俱寂，明月慢慢升过了山头。突然间，月光照亮了幽谷，坐在巉崖上的探险家忽地望见下面谷中，有无数的象牙和巨骨堆积如山，在清澈如水的光华下发出白森森的光辉。一切如处梦境，他所日夜梦想的“象的墓场”，而今居然出现在眼前。探险家不禁大喊一声：“我找到了！”
    找到了？是真的吗？
    自古以来，不知曾有多少探险家、旅行家、狩猎家或是其他的什么家，怀抱着同样的奢望，踏遍非洲和东南亚的森林原野，梦想有朝一日会成为“象的墓场”的第一个发现者，于是立成巨富，名扬四海。可是几百年过去了，有谁真地成为发现者了呢？一个也没有。
    也许这个传说太富于引诱力了，我在2月1日出版的“新观察”里看到有一篇文章，谈到在西双版纳的民间也有相似的传说。无论如何，这是令人很感觉兴趣的，由此可见，凡是产象的地区，不论中外，差不多总有这类传说。而且父传子，子传孙，累代地传下来，可是谁也没亲眼看见过。
    据传说说，大象到了老年，能自知末日之将临。而由于象族也有一块“公墓”，所以不论它离开这里多么远，也一定要赶回去，好死在那里。千百年来，那里的象牙、象骨自然堆积如山，而谁要发现了它，自然也不亚于故事中发现了金矿的人那么幸运。
    可惜传说又添上这么几句：“象的墓场”位置在任何人也找不到的地方，只有将死的老象才能找到；而且，万一有人无意中走近，也会有“象的精灵”或山妖、异兽之类出来阻拦。这样一来，既增添了许多神秘气氛，也为找不着那块地方做了注解。
    其实无论怎样讲，也是难以自圆其说的。可能传说是美丽的，但是在科学的面前就失去了说服力。精灵或山妖之类固属无稽，难道大象比人更聪明？它能找到的地方，人就找不到？即使说在非洲大陆的腹地还有极少数尚未印上人类足迹的地方，可是在印度、缅甸、马来亚等等人口密的地方如何呢？在东非、南非的靠近海岸的地区如何呢？千百年来，这些地方的“象的墓场”靠什么障眼术维持存在呢？如果仔细想想，自不难看穿了传说的虚构性。
    但同时也存在着一些疑问，例如：为什么人们极少发现死象的大牙呢？为什么连象的尸体也很少见呢？
    现在让我试图解答一下。
    熟悉象群生活的人们大都知道，象群的活动力很强，平日经常移动数十里以至百余里。这是因为它们的食量特别大（每一只每天约需嫩枝、幼芽、鲜草等五、六百斤），任何丛林草原也供不起一大群象长期的消耗。牡象年纪老了，追随渐感吃力，又因脾气越来越古怪，在群中难以相处，以致和象群渐渐疏远，终有一日完全脱离（也可能是被赶走的）。各地传说，都说老象独自去死，这种观察还是正确的，因为象在晚年总是孤独度日的。
    孤独的老象既走不了远路，身体日趋衰弱，故只好找那草最深、林最密、离人烟最远的僻静地方去藏身。这样的地方多半是离河边不远的低地，以便于取食和饮水。有一天，它的末日终于来到。也许死于一场热带的大暴雨中，也许死于河水泛滥中，这样，它的尸骨就被洪水冲散，或者沉陷在泥沙里。即使没有这样沉陷，热带也有着成群的各种腐食者（鬣狗、豺、秃鹫等），用不了一两天就会把那残骸打扫干净。甚至连它的骨骼和大牙也难免受到光顾，因为热带有很多豪猪（俗名箭猪），专门要啮食这样的物体。
    是否会有不被啃啮的象牙留下来呢？也可能有。但是古生物学家们都会告诉你：在热带地区是很难找到多少化石材料的。那里的气候这样热，雨量这样多，土壤那样潮湿，腐蚀作用这样大，就是象牙也不能长期不坏，更不用说在土里慢慢长大起来了（一种违反常识的说法）！须知这里比不得西伯利亚。人们在西伯利亚的“天然冷藏库”里找出来的猛犸（古代巨象）不但骨和牙完整，甚至连肉和毛都还没坏，而它的被“冷藏”的期限竟已不止万年了！但是猛犸有没有固定的“墓场”呢？也没有。
