"The Empty Fort Strategy" (Fable)

There was a man who particularly admired Zhuge Liang's wisdom, even to the point of imitation.

One day, the nearby theater was performing "The Empty Fort Strategy," which he naturally had to see. But he was the only one at home, and there was no one to watch the house. Suddenly, an idea struck him: why not learn from Kongming and use the "Empty Fort Strategy"? So, he opened the front door wide, lit the lamps, and deliberately said to the house as he left, "I'll be right back."

That night, he watched the play anxiously. When he returned home, nothing was missing. He couldn't help but shout, "Zhuge Liang, Zhuge Kongming, you are truly a divine man!"

Another time, Zhuge Liang's play was on again. It was always something like "Borrowing the East Wind" or "Angering Zhou Yu." He encountered the same situation and, without thinking, used the "Empty Fort Strategy" again. This evening, he enjoyed the play thoroughly and returned home elated. Unexpectedly, his belongings had been stolen. He stamped his feet and cursed, "Zhuge Liang, Zhuge Liang, you were deceiving people after all!"

It was an old man from the neighborhood who reminded him, "Zhuge Liang only used the Empty Fort Strategy once, and Sima Yi only fell for it once; but you used it twice..."

    “空城计”（寓言）
    有个人特别钦佩诸葛亮的智谋，甚至钦佩到了摹仿的地步。
    某天，邻近的戏院里演“空城计”，他当然非看不可。但只他一人在家，东西无人看管。忽然，他灵机一动：何不学孔明用个“空城计”呢？于是，大开家门，点燃灯火，临走还对屋里故意说了声：“我去去就来。”
    这一晚，他提心吊胆地看了戏，看完回家，东西果然没有丢失的。他不禁大喊道：“诸葛亮呀诸葛孔明，你真神人也！”
    又一次，又演诸葛亮的戏了。总是“借东风”、“气周瑜”之类吧。他遇到了同样情况，不加思索地又用了“空城计”。这一晚戏看得痛快，他兴高采烈地回得家来。不料东西被偷了。于是，他顿足大骂：“诸葛亮啊诸葛亮，原来你也骗人！”
    倒是邻居的一位老人提醒他：“诸葛亮只用一次空城计，司马懿只上一次当；可你用了两次啊……”。
