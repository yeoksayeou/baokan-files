Xinhua News Agency, 17th — The National Youth Art Workers Exhibition opened today at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace.

    The exhibition demonstrates the vigorous youthful strength of China's art world. Many works show that the young generation of art workers are tirelessly exploring the essence of the splendid reality, using the art of form to express the great spirit of the times and the noble qualities of contemporaries. Even if some works are not yet mature, they are all full of youthful vigor, which gives the works an inherent moving power.
    Huang Zhou's traditional Chinese painting "Wilderness Wind and Snow" depicts the heroic spirit of exploration team members who brave the wind and snow and are active in remote areas. A female team member walking in front on a tall camel is facing the wind and snow and looking into the distance, and this posture expresses her heroic spirit. Beside her is a Kazakh hunter leading the way, with a fiery red turban, a hunting gun on his shoulder, and a *dongbula* in his arms, vividly expressing his boldness, optimism, and national character. The painter uses few strokes, but already the paper is filled with the chill of a day of wind and snow, setting off the exploration team members' ardent patriotism. On the grassland, a herd of horses is galloping, and the lasso of a herdsman is about to fall on the neck of a galloping horse with its brown mane standing on end. This is the scene of the traditional Chinese painting "Lassoing a Horse," in which the author Liu Boshu describes the moment of rapid activity of people and horses, with a strong sense of rhythm. There are also many traditional Chinese paintings with the themes of landscapes, flowers, birds, insects, and fish, but no phenomena of imitating the ancients or making up stories can be seen.
    In the gallery displaying oil paintings, Zhang Qinruo's "Seaside" attracts people with its harmonious and bright colors. Waves flow on the azure sea; the sky, as blue as the sea, rolls with clouds. Chen Zhongzhi's "Joy of Morning in a Mountain Village" expresses the joy of a midwife and an old woman for the birth of a new life. Although the protagonist—the baby—does not appear in the picture. Gao Di's "Two Sisters" has a rigorous structure, bright colors, novelty, and decorative interest, and has been selected by the "New Observer" magazine to be the cover.
    The labor spent by the authors of comic strips and illustrations is huge. The painter must first deeply understand the spirit of the original work and the thoughts and feelings of the characters, and then, according to the genre and style of the original work, create vivid images with corresponding "painting language." Comic strips such as Wang Xuyang and Ben Qingyu's "I Want to Study," Wang Hongli's "The Fairy Couple," and He Youzhi's "Battle on the Train" faithfully depict the characters and pay attention to the background and atmosphere. The illustrations made by Jiang Ying, Wu Jingbo, and others for the novels "Sixty Years of Change" and "Sanliwan," etc., also add a lot of color to the original works.
    The print gallery is like a collection of prose. Whether black and white or color, they are all fresh and bright. The watercolor gallery is like a collection of lyrical poems. The beautiful scenery and elegant still lifes each show their strengths.
    The exhibition also features New Year pictures, cartoons, sculptures, posters, sketches, and quick sketches.
    The exhibition features more than 900 works by 845 young people, including art workers, workers, soldiers, doctors, teachers, and students from the Han, Mongolian, Uygur, Hui, Miao, Manchu, and Buyi ethnic groups.

### 显示美术界旺盛的青春力量  全国青年美术作品展览会开幕

    显示美术界旺盛的青春力量
    全国青年美术作品展览会开幕
    新华社17日讯　全国青年美术工作者作品展览会今日在北京市劳动人民文化宫开幕。
    展览会显示了我国美术界旺盛的青春力量。许多作品说明了青年一代的美术工作者正在不倦地探索绚烂的现实生活的实质，以造型艺术来表现伟大的时代气魄、同时代人的高尚品质。即使有些作品还不够成熟，可是都洋溢着蓬勃朝气，也由此而赋予作品一种内在的感人力量。
    黄胄的国画“洪荒风雪”描画了冲风冒雪、活跃在边远地区的勘探队员豪迈的精神气质。跨着高大的骆驼走在最前面的一位女队员正迎着风雪，了望远方，这个姿态就表达了她的英雄气概。她的旁边是一个引路的哈萨克族猎人，他包着火红的头巾，肩背猎枪、怀抱东不拉，传神地表达了他的豪放、乐观的心胸和民族性格。画家用笔不多，但已经是一天风雪满纸寒意，烘托出勘探队员炽烈的爱国热情。草原上马群在奔驰，牧人套马的绳圈将要落到一匹前蹄跃起，棕鬃毛竖起的骏马颈里，这是国画“套马”的画面，作者刘勃舒描写了人、马急遽活动的一刹那间，有着强烈的节奏感。以山水花卉、鸟兽虫鱼为题材的国画也不少，但看不到摹古臆造的现象。
    陈列油画的画廊里，张钦若的“海边”以它的调和、明朗的色彩吸引着人们。蔚蓝的海面上流动着浪花；和海水一样蓝的天空舒卷着云采。陈忠志的“山村早晨的喜悦”表现了接生员和老婆婆为一个新生命降生而喜悦的情绪。虽然，主角——婴孩并没有出现在画面上。高帝的“姊妹俩”结构谨严，颜色鲜明，新颖而且富有装饰趣味，已经被“新观察”杂志物色去作封面了。
    连环画和插图的作者花费的劳动是巨大的。画家首先要深刻理解原著精神、人物的思想感情，再按照原著的体裁、风格，以相应的 “绘画语言”创造出活生生的形象来。王绪阳、贲庆余合作的“我要读书”，王弘力的“天仙配”和贺友直的“火车上的战斗”等连环画都忠实地描画了人物形象而且注意了背景和气氛。江荧、吴静波等人为小说“六十年的变迁”、“三里湾”等作的插图也使原著生色不少。
    版画画廊好像一本散文集。无论黑白或者套色都一样的清新明快。水彩画廊犹如一册抒情诗集。绮丽的风景、雅淡的静物，各尽其妙。
    这次展出的还有年画、漫画、雕塑作品、招贴画、素描和速写。
    展览会共展出八百四十五位青年的九百多件作品。包括了汉、蒙古、维吾尔、回、苗、满、布依等民族的美术工作者、工人、战士、医生、教员和学生。
