　　I fully endorse Chairman Mao's instructions and the reports by Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Li, and I agree with the work report of the Standing Committee. At this conference, I would like to share my opinions on the teaching and research of animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, and on promoting the legacy of veterinary medicine in our motherland.

　　Fully Utilize the Role of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Teachers; Teaching and Scientific Research Institutions Should be Closely Integrated

　　Since the Party and the government have vigorously developed animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, these fields, like other sectors in our country, have experienced rapid development. However, with the improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the broad masses of people, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine have lagged far behind. Especially with Chairman Mao's recent call to vigorously produce hogs, our responsibility as animal husbandry and veterinary workers has become even greater. In order to rapidly improve the level of this discipline and better fulfill the tasks outlined in the National Programme for Agricultural Development 1956-1967, we must vigorously train cadres and carry out scientific research. Therefore, I suggest that, based on China's actual situation, where animal husbandry and veterinary cadres, especially senior technical cadres, are extremely scarce and the foundation of this science is very weak, we should concentrate our efforts and give full play to the role of the limited number of experienced teachers in the nation's eleven or twelve animal husbandry and veterinary colleges (equivalent to one-third of those in the Soviet Union). On the one hand, they should train students to cultivate cadres for the country, and on the other hand, they should carry out scientific research. Neither aspect should be neglected. Therefore, I believe that teaching and scientific research institutions should be closely integrated. The practice of each setting up its own shop and robbing Peter to pay Paul is inappropriate and should be given attention by relevant departments. Under such close integration, it is hoped that a scientific research institution can be established in Beijing by concentrating resources, as animal husbandry and veterinary medicine also need to be closely related to other disciplines (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.). It would be very inconvenient and would affect development if it were located in remote areas. At the same time, this research institution should also be relatively complete, including all relevant disciplines. With the efforts of animal husbandry and veterinary workers, it will be possible to rapidly develop this weak discipline.

　　Let me also talk about promoting the legacy of veterinary medicine in our motherland.

　　Promoting the legacy of veterinary medicine in our motherland should also be one of the important topics in the current socialist animal husbandry construction. Our veterinary medicine not only originated very early, but also has had extremely brilliant achievements throughout the ages. As it stands now, the number of folk veterinarians is considerable. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 150,000 across the country, the vast majority of whom come from the working people and are indeed a powerful force in the construction of animal husbandry in our motherland. Since liberation, although the Party and the government have given considerable attention to promoting the legacy of veterinary medicine in our motherland and giving play to the role of folk veterinarians, some issues still need further research and resolution. I propose:

　　Suggest Establishing a Research Institution for the Legacy of Veterinary Medicine in Our Motherland; Chinese and Western Veterinarians Should Cooperate Closely; Strengthen Publicity on the Social Status of Folk Veterinarians and Rationally Adjust Their Treatment

　　1. Regarding the research institution for the legacy of veterinary medicine in our motherland, although there have been proposals before, there is still no national veterinary research institution of a certain scale. In human medicine, not only has the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine been established, but also colleges of traditional Chinese medicine have been set up. In comparison, it is felt that veterinary medicine is far behind. It is hoped that the relevant departments will actively solve this problem. It is best to prepare a laboratory in the Academy of Agricultural Sciences first, and gradually expand it into an institute, to lead the summarization and research of the legacy of veterinary medicine nationwide.

　　2. The issue of mutual learning between Chinese and Western veterinarians is one of the important issues for promoting the legacy of veterinary medicine in our motherland or enriching our modern veterinary science. At the present stage, only through close cooperation, mutual assistance, and mutual learning between Chinese and Western veterinarians can we achieve the goal of learning from each other's strengths and improving each other. However, at present, those who have studied Western veterinary medicine generally do not study Chinese veterinary medicine enough, which should be strengthened in the future. On the other hand, those who want to learn currently feel that there are some problems that must be solved. Taking the situation of the Veterinary Department of Beijing Agricultural University as an example, as early as two years ago, it was planned to hire several experienced folk veterinarians to the school so that everyone could learn from them. However, after finding suitable people, there was a lack of attention and active support in the process of requesting their transfer, and the people requested have still not been able to take office at the school to this day. On the other hand, the publication of classical veterinary works should also be given attention. At present, in addition to "Yuan Heng Liao Ma Ji," other works have not been published in time to meet the needs of learning or research. Furthermore, Chinese veterinary medicine teaching and research groups should be added to higher veterinary medical education, actively preparing conditions to teach Chinese veterinary medicine courses, and enabling the group to become the core of a department or school for learning and researching the legacy of veterinary medicine in our motherland. Therefore, the relevant central departments need to make unified arrangements, and provinces and cities must attach importance to and support the recommendation of folk veterinarians with expertise or rich experience to participate in the work of colleges and universities or research institutions, in order to inherit and promote the legacy of veterinary medicine in our motherland.

　　3. Regarding strengthening publicity on the social status of folk veterinarians and rationally adjusting their treatment. Since liberation, although the Party and the government have given equal importance to the status of people in various industries that are beneficial to the people, the social status of folk veterinarians has also been greatly improved. However, some people still retain the influence of the old society, believing that engaging in veterinary medicine is not as good as other industries, and there are even phenomena of people preventing their children from studying veterinary medicine, which are heard of from time to time. This requires relevant parties to strengthen the publicity and education on the social status of veterinary workers, especially folk veterinarians, in order to reverse the phenomenon of underestimating this work. Furthermore, since the upsurge of national agricultural cooperation, the vast majority of folk veterinarians have joined agricultural cooperatives or veterinary stations, joint clinics, and other institutions, but the phenomenon of their low treatment is still widespread. Veterinary work is a technical mental labor, and their treatment should be reasonably adjusted according to the principle of "to each according to his work" so that they can more wholeheartedly contribute to the cause of socialist animal husbandry. Otherwise, not only will existing folk veterinarians change careers, but young people will also be unwilling to study it. In this way, the number of folk veterinarians will become less and less, but it will not be possible to train many new veterinary talents in a short time, which will inevitably aggravate the phenomenon of "lack of doctors for animal diseases."

　　The above are my personal opinions, which may not be comprehensive, but I hope they will attract the attention of relevant departments and be resolved. (Attached picture)

　　关于畜牧兽医学的两个问题
　　熊大仕的发言
    我完全拥护毛主席的指示和周总理、李副总理的报告并同意常务委员会的工作报告，借此大会上我想谈一谈关于畜牧兽医学的教学与研究和关于发扬祖国兽医学遗产的意见。
    充分发挥畜牧兽医教师的作用，教学与科学研究机关应密切结合
    在党和政府大力发展畜牧兽医事业以来，畜牧兽医事业也同我国其他事业一样有了突飞猛进的发展，但随着广大人民物质文化生活水平的提高，畜牧兽医事业却远远地落在后面了。尤其最近毛主席提出要大力生产毛猪的号召下，这对我们畜牧兽医工作者来说责任更重大了。为了使畜牧兽医这门学科的水平能够迅速提高，更好的完成农业十二年规划纲要中所提的任务，就必须大力培养干部和开展科学研究工作。因此我建议：根据我国实际情况，在畜牧兽医干部，尤其是高级技术干部极少同时这门科学的基础也很薄弱的情况下，应集中使用力量，把全国仅有的十一、二个畜牧兽医院系（相当于苏联的三分之一）为数不多的有经验的教师的作用充分发挥起来。一方面使他们能培养学生给国家培养干部，另一方面也要开展科学研究工作，二者不能偏废，因此我认为教学与科学研究机关要密切结合。各立门户、挖东墙补西墙的办法是不恰当的，应引起有关部门重视。在这样的密切结合下希望在北京集中力量能建立一个科学研究机关，因畜牧兽医学科也需要与其他学科（物理化学，生物等）有密切联系，如设在边远地区就很不便而影响了发展，同时这个研究机关也应该是比较完整的，应包括有关各学科。这样加上畜牧兽医工作者的努力才有可能使这薄弱的学科得到迅速发展。
    再谈一谈关于发扬祖国兽医学遗产问题。
    关于发扬祖国兽医学遗产问题，也应为当前社会主义畜牧业建设中很重要的课题之一。我国兽医学不但起源很早，并且历代均有着极其光辉的成就。就现在看来，民间兽医的数量相当可观，据不完全统计全国约有十五万人以上，其中绝大多数均出自于劳动人民，实为祖国畜牧业建设中的一支强大力量。自从解放以后，党和政府虽然对发扬祖国兽医学遗产和发挥民间兽医的作用方面，曾给以相当重视，但有些问题，还须作进一步的研究和解决。我提议：
    建议成立祖国兽医学遗产的研究机构；中西兽医应紧密合作；加强民间兽医社会地位的宣传，合理调整民间兽医的待遇
    一、关于祖国兽医学遗产的研究机构方面，虽然曾有人倡议在先，但现在还没有一个全国性的具有一定规模的兽医研究机构。在人医方面不但已有了中医研究院的设立，并且设立了中医学院，互相对照之下，实感到兽医方面远远的落在后面了。希望有关方面积极的解决这一问题，最好在农业科学院中能先筹备一室，逐渐扩大为所，以领导全国兽医学遗产的总结和研究工作。
    二、关于中西兽医互相学习问题，是发扬祖国兽医学遗产或丰富我国现代兽医科学的重要问题之一。在现阶段只有中西兽医紧密的合作，互助互学，才能达到取长补短、相互提高的目的。但目前学过西兽医学的人，一般对中兽医的学习尚嫌不够，今后应当加强。另一方面想学的人，目前尚感到有些问题，必须加以解决。就以北京农业大学兽医系的情况作例来说，早在二年以前就拟聘请几位经验丰富的民间兽医来校，使大家学有所师。但当物色好适当的人以后，在请调过程中出现了不够重视和积极支持的地方，直到今天请调的人仍然未能到校任职。另一方面对于兽医古典著作的出版工作，也应当重视。现在除了“元亨疗马集”外，其他著作尚未能即时出版，以应学习或研究之用。再，应当在高等兽医学教育中增设中兽医教研组，积极准备条件讲授中兽医课程，并使该组能成为一系或一校的学习和研究祖国兽医学遗产的核心。因此就需要中央有关部门作统一安排，还须各省市能以重视和支持推荐有专长或有丰富经验的民间兽医，参加高等院校或研究机构的工作，以利祖国兽医学遗产的继承和发扬。
    三、关于加强民间兽医社会地位的宣传和合理的调整民间兽医的待遇问题。自解放以后，虽然党和政府对于各种有利于人民的行业者的地位，均给以同等重视，因而民间兽医的社会地位也大大提高了。但有些人尚遗存着旧社会的影响，认为搞兽医这一行，不如其他行业好，甚至有的人阻止他的子弟学习兽医的现象，日有所闻。这就须要有关方面加强兽医工作者尤其是民间兽医的社会地位的宣传教育，以扭转对这一工作的轻视现象。再，自从全国农业合作化高潮以后，绝大多数的民间兽医都参加了农业合作社或兽医站、联合诊所等机构，但其待遇偏低的现象，尚普遍存在着。兽医工作是一项带有技术性的脑力劳动者，应当根据按劳取酬的原则，合理调整其待遇，使他们能更安心的为社会主义畜牧事业贡献出力量来。不然现有民间兽医不但会改行，而年青人也就不愿意去学习了，这样一来民间兽医人数越来越少，但一时又不能培养出很多新兽医学的人才来，势必使“畜病乏医”的现象加重起来。
    以上是我个人的意见，可能不够全面，但仍望能引起有关部门的重视和解决。（附图片）
