Xinhua News Agency, 27th - The capital's various circles gathered more than 1,300 people tonight at the Tianqiao Theater in Beijing to solemnly commemorate the centenary of the death of the world cultural figure, Russian composer Mikhail Ivanovich Glinka.

Shen Yanbing, Standing Committee Member of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and Vice Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, presided over the commemoration and delivered the opening speech. He said that Glinka's musical works are a precious spiritual food for people all over the world. He said that tonight's commemoration demonstrates the Chinese people's love for Glinka and the Chinese people's friendship with the Soviet people. The Chinese people respect and love the excellent cultural traditions of all countries. This noble sentiment of the people is the source of strength for promoting mutual understanding, cultural exchange, and safeguarding world peace among the people of all countries.

Lü Ji, Chairman of the Chinese Musicians Association, delivered a report at the meeting entitled "Glinka - The Father of Russian Music, the Soul of the Russian People." After introducing Glinka's life, thought, and artistic achievements, Lü Ji said that realism and populism run through Glinka's works like a red thread, because Glinka followed an important principle in his creation: to be faithful to the life of the people. Lü Ji said that Chinese musicians such as Nie Er and Xian Xinghai, as well as many musicians today, have been inspired and influenced by Glinka's patriotic ideas and people-oriented music. They all believe that it is necessary to inherit and carry forward the excellent traditions of our national music, and to create music with our national characteristics based on the creation of people's music, and contribute it to the people.

Soviet expert working at the Central Conservatory of Music, Soviet Deputy Doctor of Art Studies, A. Kanzinski, then gave a report in which he analyzed Glinka's works.
