Cultivating new creative forces is an important issue in China's literary and art circles. As a field for publishing works, publishing houses must naturally bear this responsibility.

However, upon careful consideration, the issue doesn't seem so simple.

Cultivation contains educational significance. The basic educational responsibility of a publishing house is to conduct healthy education that benefits the national economy and the people's livelihood through the works it publishes to the broad masses of people. The issue facing publishing houses should be to improve the quality of publications and provide readers with rich nutritional value. If a publishing house deviates from the goal of serving readers to consider other issues, or puts the reader issue in a secondary position, it is, in my opinion, to put it seriously, a criminal act.

Since liberation, the task of publishing houses has been defined as conducting Marxist-Leninist propaganda and education for the broad masses of people, which is correct; but then comes another unwritten obligation: to cultivate new forces!

Moreover, the general public interprets "new forces" very broadly and vaguely, as if all young contributors are new forces, thus concluding that all young contributors must be cultivated.

The result of this reasoning can be very serious. The editors of publishing houses are very busy, reading and rereading the submissions of young people, looking at them from all angles, fearing that they might miss or bury a new force. This can still be said to be a serious work attitude. What is serious is that when editors come into contact with original manuscripts, as long as it is the work of a new force, even if it is not worth adopting, they must "cultivate" it. Thus, rejection letters must describe the shortcomings of the work in great detail, and patiently tell them how to write this article well, and introduce them to many relevant reference books. Otherwise, it is considered a rude disregard for the new forces, and they will be criticized.

As a result, all publishing houses have accumulated a large number of manuscripts. It is commonplace for authors to write letters to scold them, and newspapers have also criticized them. Publishing houses themselves are constantly conducting inspections, and publishing house leaders are appealing to administrative superiors for insufficient editorial strength, demanding the addition of editorial staff. As a result, the staffing of various publishing houses has exceeded that of the past Kaiming Bookstore and Life Bookstore. Is the problem solved? It can be asserted that it will not be solved. Even if it is solved temporarily, it will immediately revert to a regular phenomenon, because as the cultural level of the people across the country improves, the submission rate will only rise and not fall. Treating the addition of editorial staff as a solution to the backlog of manuscripts is not addressing the root cause.

The problem lies in changing our perception of publishing houses.

As mentioned above, the responsibility of publishing houses is to recommend excellent works to the broad masses of readers. Editors must select excellent works from countless submissions (including commissioned and unsolicited manuscripts) and publish them. As for the necessary processing before typesetting, that is to make the manuscripts more perfect, not to overstep your bounds. Therefore, the most important responsibility of an editor is not tutoring, but discovery. They must discover good works from the submissions. If the author of this good work is a young person, or a stranger in the literary world, then this is a new force. It is necessary to provide some encouragement and help to this new force, but the purpose is still for the readers.

If we affirm that the responsibility of publishing houses is cultivation based on discovery, then the current view of equating publishing houses with university liberal arts departments or creative groups in people's organizations is worth discussing.

School teachers must correct students' papers, and creative groups should put forward specific opinions on the works of their members and provide necessary guidance. Their purpose is to improve the person writing the work. However, the purpose of publishing houses is not the same as theirs. The purpose of publishing houses is to select good works for publication, and its object is the work. If editors insist on spending a lot of time on works that cannot be published, although it cannot be said to be a bad thing, the result will inevitably delay the processing time of manuscripts, increase the number of editors, and the production of publishing houses will be reduced accordingly. Readers will be delayed in reading publications or will have fewer things to read. Why don't we consider these consequences!

It is impossible to replace schools and people's organizations with publishing houses. The result of implementing this for several years has made the relationship between publishing houses and authors worse and worse. In this Hundred Flowers Campaign, the publishing houses have been unanimously attacked. Editors dare not raise their heads when walking on the road, for fear of encountering the authors of the manuscripts piled up in their hands. But what can they do? Are there still lazy editors now? They are working all day in a way that they cannot breathe!

    培养和发掘
    孔另境
    新生创作力量的培养问题，是我国文艺界的重要问题。出版社既是出版作品的园地，必然也要负起这个责任来了。
    可是仔细一想，又觉得问题并不简单。
    培养是含有教育意义在内的，出版社所负的基本教育责任是要通过印行出来的作品对广大人民进行健康的有利于国计民生的教育。出版社面前的问题，应该是使出版物质量提高、供给读者以丰富的营养价值的问题。出版社倘离开了读者这个目标而去考虑其他问题，或把读者问题放在次要地位，照我想，说得严重一点，是一种犯罪的行为。
    解放以来把出版社的任务规定为对广大人民进行马克思列宁主义的宣传教育，那是不错的；可是接着又来上一条不见明文规定的义务：培养新生力量！
    而且，一般人把新生力量解释得非常广泛，非常含混，似乎凡年青的投稿者都是新生力量，因而得出的结论是：凡年青的投稿者都得培养。
    这个推论的结果可严重得很，出版社的编辑同志可忙坏了，把青年人的投稿一读再读，横看竖看，惟恐失眼，漏掉或埋没了一个新生力量，这还可说是认真工作的态度。严重的是编辑接触原稿的时候，只要是新生力量的作品，即使毫无可取之处，也硬要加以“培养”，于是退稿信中得把作品的缺点说得巨细不遗，还得耐心告诉他如何可以把这篇文章写好，介绍他许多有关的参考书。要不这样，便是粗暴地蔑视新生力量，会受到批评。
    结果是各出版社都积压着大量的稿件，作者写信来骂是家常便饭，报纸上也批评了，出版社自己也不断进行检查，出版社领导向行政上级呼吁编辑力量不足，要求补充编辑人员，于是各个出版社的人员配备都超过了过去的开明书店和生活书店。问题是不是解决了呢？可断言不会解决的，即使一时解决了，马上会恢复为经常现象的，因为随着全国人民文化程度的提高，来稿率只会上升不会下降的，把补充编辑人员作为解决积压稿件的办法并不是对症下药。
    问题在改变我们对出版社的一个观念。
    上面说过，出版社的责任是在把优秀的作品推荐给广大的读者，编辑人员要在无数的投稿（包括特约稿和自由来稿）中选择优秀的东西把它印出来，至于发排前的必要加工，那是为把稿件弄得更完善些，决不是要你越俎代庖的。所以编辑者的最重要职责，不可能是辅导性的，而必须是发见性的，要在投稿中发掘出好作品来，这种好作品的作者倘是年青人，或是文坛上的陌生人，这就是新生力量。对这种新生力量进行一些鼓励和帮助是必要的，可是目的还是为读者。
    假使肯定了出版社的职责是在发掘基础上的培养，那就和当前的把出版社和大学文科或人民团体中的创作组等同的看法就值得商量了。
    学校老师对学生课卷一定要加以批改，创作组对成员的作品应该提出具体的意见，加以必要的辅导，他们的目的都是要使写这作品的人有所提高。然而出版社的目的并不和他们相同，出版社的目的是要选择好作品给它出版，它的对象是作品。如果编辑者硬要在不能出版的作品上费去许多的时间，虽然不能说是坏事情，但结果势必要拖延稿件的处理时间，增加编辑人员的名额，出版社的生产品相应地减少，读者延迟了读到出版物或减少了能够读到的东西。这些后果我们为甚么不考虑考虑呢！
    把出版社代替了学校和人民团体的办法是行不通的，几年来实行的结果使出版社和作者的关系愈搞愈坏，在这次百家争鸣中受到一致攻击的是出版社，编辑同志走在路上不敢抬起头来，怕碰到积压在手里的稿件的作者，然而有什么办法呢？现在还有偷懒的编辑吗？他们是在整天透不过气来地工作着呀！
