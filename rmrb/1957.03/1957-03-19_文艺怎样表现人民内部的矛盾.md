How Should Literature and Art Represent Contradictions Among the People?
Zhang Tianyi

I want to raise a question: how should contradictions among the people be represented in our literary and artistic works? This is still a new subject for us.

Our publications have already featured some influential works of this kind, such as Liu Binyan's "On the Bridge Construction Site," "Internal News of This Newspaper," and Wang Meng's "The Young Man Who Arrived at the Organization Department." These few have attracted much attention and also stirred up some debate, especially Wang Meng's.

Sometimes, the works of some writers are destined to encounter such a fate, and I myself have experienced it: readers have inconsistent, even opposing, views. For example, regarding the same character in a work, some readers like him, affirm him, and say he is a role model for young people; others dislike him and negate him, saying he is a petty bourgeois. Some opinions even surprise the author himself.

Why is this?

I once thought: there are all kinds of people among the readers, coming from various classes and strata. Therefore, their views, interests, and experiences will naturally be different.

Furthermore, when a work is published, if it happens to coincide with a time when the ideological situation of the masses of readers is undergoing turbulent changes, when contradictions between various ideologies are emerging and struggling, and when our ideological life is about to undergo a new development—at this time, the ideological contradictions among the readers will inevitably be reflected in their views on this work.

This is the actual situation. But it's only the reader's side of the situation.

What about the other side—we authors?

We say to the readers: you have misunderstood, my original intention was not like this. But the readers say: we don't care what your original intention was, we only look at what you have written.

Indeed, readers have all kinds of thoughts and feelings, so they have their own views on things in life. However, when it comes to the things in our works, the things we write—that is no longer the original form of things in life. It has already been selected, summarized, and refined by the author's mind and emotions: here, there are the author's views and attitudes, to be conveyed to the reader, to influence and educate the reader. Of course, some readers—either due to limited reading ability or limited life experience—will understand it to varying degrees, or even misunderstand it. However, for the general reader, I think their basic view of the life segment and the character described should follow the author's lead, without any fundamental differences or contradictions. If there are, then we have to look back at ourselves: are there any contradictions in my own views and attitudes? If I have contradictions when dealing with this character—perhaps I am not even aware of it, but I just feel unsure in my heart, and the rights and wrongs, loves and hates are not very clear, not very certain, or the weight is not properly balanced—then differences and contradictions in the reader's views are unavoidable.

Therefore, I would like to raise one or two questions—to see if they become questions, and whether this way of raising them is correct?

One is, from what standpoint, from what angle, and with what attitude does the author look at the shortcomings in ourselves?

In writing this type of work, the author's attitude of love and hate, affirmation and negation, is, in my opinion, much more complicated than when expressing contradictions between ourselves and the enemy. Before liberation, when we wrote about exposing the enemy, the rights and wrongs, loves and hates, were easy to define and distinguish. The author's standpoint was on the side of the people—standing on this grand position, it was easy to handle. Now, however, we have to deal with contradictions among the people. There is more than one class among the people, and there are so many intricate and complex relationships between the several classes and strata. We ourselves are involved in this contradictory relationship, so the question of where we should stand is not so simple, it is much more delicate.

There will always be a standpoint. Even if what I write is true, based on real people and real events, and I "write what I see," I will always have a standpoint, and I will always "see" it from a certain angle and with a certain attitude—whether I am aware of this or not. Sometimes, I may be irresistibly drawn to care about and pay attention to certain aspects of life, to favor certain things. Sometimes, I may waver between several different standpoints, so that my attitude becomes vague. These situations further illustrate that we must face this issue squarely. Then, there is also the issue of the size and depth of the area of love or hate—which can also be said to be a matter of discretion. This can only be resolved with the resolution of the above question.

Secondly, the question of the aspects the author sees and the aspects that are written out.

Our work—especially a short story—cannot, of course, write about all aspects of life. But when we experience life, we must look at all aspects, look at them more comprehensively; we cannot write after seeing just a little bit. An author who sees life comprehensively, who sees how progress and backwardness contradict and struggle, and who sees how this contradiction will inevitably be resolved—then, even if he only exposes the backward aspects, with positive characters appearing very little, or even not at all, I think that the work he writes will be fundamentally different from the work written by an author who only sees the backward aspects and does not see the progressive forces: he can still make the reader feel the two sides of the matter.

When writing about characters, I think there is also such a question: what is written out may only be one side, but what is seen must be comprehensive. If I only see one aspect of him—I don't care whether this aspect is revealed from his character, or is just an occasional manifestation, and I only say that this is true, it is not my fabrication—if I just use this aspect to judge this whole person, and write it out like this, people will not be convinced. If we look at more aspects, look at more characters, and see the nature of this kind of person, how this nature developed, and in what direction it is developing—if we write several typical bureaucratic roles in this way, and dig out its old roots—that would be truly sharp—to write such works would truly be a great contribution.

Thirdly, we authors must also consider how others will feel when they read this type of work we write.

Before liberation, when we wrote about exposing the darkness, we always handled it in this way: to make the reader feel that this darkness was not an accidental, temporary, or local phenomenon, but an inevitable product of the ruling system at that time. To eliminate this darkness, we had to fundamentally overthrow that dark system itself. Now, we have indeed overthrown it. Now, we ourselves still inevitably have some shortcomings and faults, but the system is fundamentally different, and the problems are fundamentally different as well. These shortcomings and faults—such as bureaucracy—are indeed very serious and annoying, but they are ultimately local, and are individual backward elements in our advancing mainstream, which can be resolved from within the people. This is the law of development of our social life, and we should not be afraid. Don't think that thinking this way will lead to the fault of formulization and conceptualization. We must oppose formulization and conceptualization, but we cannot therefore negate the law of development of social life. These two are by no means the same thing, but are precisely enemies: truly and vividly grasping the law of development of our social life is a good medicine for curing formulization and conceptualization.

There are many questions about how contradictions among the people are reflected in works. I have only thought of these few now, and I raise them in the hope that they can be gradually clarified and resolved.

To solve them, we must, of course, study hard. Study theory. More importantly, we must learn in actual life, and learn to solve contradictions among the people in practice. Of course, we must also learn to write, and the things we write will inevitably be very immature and have shortcomings. We hope to receive good criticism and cultivation.

I hope to receive criticism on the question I have raised—whether it is appropriate or not.

    文艺怎样表现人民内部的矛盾
    张天翼
    我想要提一个问题：在我们的文艺作品里面，怎样表现人民内部的矛盾。这对于我们还是一门新功课。
    我们的刊物上已经出现过这一类的影响较大的作品，例如刘宾雁的“在桥梁工地上”、“本报内部消息”和王蒙的“组织部新来的青年人”等等。这几篇很受人注意，也很引起了一些争论，尤其是王蒙的那一篇。
    有些作家的作品，有时候是会碰到这样的命运的，我自己就曾经碰到过：读者看法不一致，甚至于对立。比如，作品里同一个人物，有的读者喜欢他，肯定他，说他是青年的榜样；有的可不喜欢他，否定他，说他是个小资产阶级。有些意见甚至于会使作者自己大吃一惊。
    为什么会这样？
    我曾经是这么想的：读者里面有各种各样的人，来自各个不同的阶级和阶层。那么他们的看法、兴趣、体会，当然就会各有不同。
    还有。作品发表的时候，要是赶上读者群众的思想情况正在有波涛起伏的变动的时候，正在各种思想意识的矛盾露了头，在斗争，而我们的思想生活正将要有一个新的发展的时候——这时候，读者中间的思想矛盾，必然会反映到他们对这篇作品的看法上面来。
    这是实际情形。可只是读者一方面的情形。
    还有一方面——我们作者呢？
    我们对读者说：你们看错了，我原来的意思不是这样的。可是读者说：我们不管你原来的意思怎么样，我们只看你写出来的怎么样。
    不错，读者们中间有各种各样的思想感情，因此他们对生活里的事物，就各有各的看法。可是，要说到我们作品里面的事物，我们所写出来的事物——那就不是原始形态的生活里面的事物了，这已经是作者费过一番脑筋，动过一番感情，加以选择、概括，是提炼出来的东西了：这里就有了作者的看法、态度，要把这个传达给读者，来影响读者、教育读者。当然，也会有一部分读者——或者限于阅读能力，或者限于生活经验，领会得有深有浅，甚至于还有不了解、或是误解的。可是一般的读者，对所写的这段生活、这个人物的基本看法，我想总该跟着作者转，没有什么根本分歧、矛盾的。要是有，那么我们就得反而求诸己了：看我自己的看法、态度上，是不是有矛盾的地方？我自己处理这个人物的时候要是有了矛盾——也许我自己并没有意识到，只是觉得心里没有底，是非和爱憎不很明确，不很一定，或者是份量把不稳，——那么读者的看法有分歧、矛盾，就不可免的了。
    因此我想提一两个问题——看是不是成为问题，这样提法对不对？
    一个是，作者站在什么立足点上，从什么角度，用一种什么态度，去看我们自身上的缺点。
    写这一类作品，作者的爱和憎、肯定和否定的态度问题，我看比表现敌我矛盾要复杂得多了。在解放前我们写暴露敌人的东西，是非、爱憎，都容易明确、分明。作者的立足点，是在人民这一边——站到这个大立场上，好办。现在可要对付人民内部矛盾了。人民内部不止一个阶级，而几个阶级、阶层之间，又有那么多错综复杂的关系，我们自己就搅在这个矛盾关系里面，那么，我们到底立足在哪一点上，问题就不那么简单了，就细致多了。
    总会有个立足点。即使我所写的，是真有其人，实有其事，我“看到什么就写什么”，我也总有一个立足点，也总是从一定的角度，带一定的态度去“看”的——不管我有没有自觉到这一点。有时候，我也许会情不自禁地去关心、注意生活的某些方面，去偏爱某些东西。有时候我也许会摇摆于几个不同的立足点之间，以至于态度也模糊不清。——这些情形就更说明我们要好好正视这个问题。接着，就还有爱或憎的面的大小和深浅的问题——也可以说是分寸问题，这也要随着上面一个问题的解决，才能解决。
    其次。作者看到的方面和写出来的方面的问题。
    我们的一篇作品——尤其是短篇，当然不可能把生活的各方面都写到。可是我们体验生活的时候，总得把各方面都看一看，看得全面些；不能看见一点点就写。一个全面看生活的作者，看到了进步和落后怎么样矛盾斗争，看到了这个矛盾必然会怎么样解决，——那么，他即使只揭露了落后方面，正面人物出场得很少，甚至于不出场，我想，那也和一个只看见落后方面而不看见进步力量的作者写出来的作品，表现得根本不一样：他仍然能使读者感觉得到事情的两面性。
    写人物，我想也有这么一个问题：写出来的也许只是一面，看的可要全面。如果我只看到了他的一方面——我不管他的这一方面是不是他性格里面流露出来的，或者只不过是偶然的表现，而我只说这是真的，不是我捏造的，——我就光拿这一方面来断定他这整个人，这么写出来，人家就不信服了。我们要是多看些方面，多看些人物，看出这号人的根性，这根性是怎么发展来的，向什么方向发展去，——要是这样来写出几种典型的官僚主义角色，挖出它的老根子来——这才能够尖锐——要写出这样的作品来，那真就功德无量了。
    再次。我们写的这一类作品，别人读了会怎么样感受，我们作者怕也得考究考究。
    解放前我们写暴露黑暗的东西，总把它处理成这样：使读者读了，感到这黑暗不是偶然的、不是临时的或局部的现象，而是当时统治制度的必然产物。要消灭这个黑暗，就得根本推翻那个黑暗制度本身。现在，果然把它推翻了。现在，我们自身上还难免有些缺点、毛病，可是制度根本不同，问题也根本不同了。这些缺点和毛病——例如官僚主义，的确很严重，很恼火，可究竟是局部的，是我们前进的主流中个别落后的东西，可以从人民内部来解决。这是我们社会生活的发展规律，不要害怕。不要以为这样一想，就会犯公式化概念化的毛病。公式化概念化我们要反对，可是不能因此就把社会生活的发展规律也否定掉。这两者绝不是一回事，倒恰恰是冤家对头：真正生动地具体地掌握了我们的社会生活的发展规律，倒是医治这个公式化概念化的一剂良药。
    人民内部矛盾在作品里怎样反映，问题还很多。我现在只想到这几个，提一提，希望能逐渐闹明白，得到解决。
    要解决，我们当然得好好学习。学理论。更要在实际生活里面学习，在实践中学着去解决人民内部的矛盾。当然还得学写，写出来的东西自必很幼稚，有缺点，希望能得到很好的批评和培养。
    我提的这个问题——提得适当不适当，也希望批评。
