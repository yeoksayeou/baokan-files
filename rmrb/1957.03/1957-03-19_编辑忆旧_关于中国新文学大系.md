    Editing Recollections
    ——About the "Compendium of New Chinese Literature"
    Zhao Jiabi
    As an editor of literary books, I most love collecting new book catalogs of literature and art from various countries around the world. My learning, time, and money do not allow me to fully read the original books, but just from flipping through the endless book titles and countless authors, each time it's like stepping into a library full of new books, refreshing my heart and mind, and keeping my eyes busy. Seeing that an author I like has published a new book is even as joyful as seeing an old friend has completed a new work. And the greater pleasure lies in the fact that I can often get some unexpected inspiration from these catalogs, which touches my mind and inspires some fresh topics.
    Recently, the International Bookstore established a new Reference Room, filled with a dazzling array of new book catalogs from foreign publishers, and those colorful catalog covers deeply attracted me. Among them, the Japanese catalogs are the most interesting to me. In the book lists of the literature and art departments, there are dozens of large-scale complete works, compendiums, libraries, and collections, ranging from hundreds of volumes to one or twenty volumes. Each set of books shows the ingenuity of the editors, and is the result of a clear editorial intention, and then a large-scale organization of authors to complete it together; it is not just a miscellaneous collection of works by many writers; and the layout and binding also have their own style. Japanese editing and publishing work once gave me an influence, and today I have come into contact with fresh information in this area, and I can't help but think of some old things from more than twenty years ago.
    In 1933, there was a Japanese bookstore called Uchiyama Bookstore at the end of North Sichuan Road in Shanghai. I was then working as an editor at Liangyou Book Company. Because I often had business to go to the bookstore to find Mr. Lu Xun, although I didn't understand Japanese, I also liked to browse the bookshelves. Once, Mr. Uchiyama gave me several Japanese new book catalogs. Among the catalogs was a library of Japanese creative literature, which was compiled into a complete set according to the order of the times. At that time, the Kuomintang was advocating a revival of the past, calling on young students to respect Confucius and read the classics; progressive cultural figures believed that the revolutionary tradition of the May Fourth Movement should be inherited and carried forward in order to save China. It had been only a little over ten years since the May Fourth Movement, but many representative works were no longer in circulation, and literary youths had to run to old book stalls to find these materials, just like ancient books. The Japanese library plan touched my mind to publish a "One Hundred Kinds of Famous Literary Works Since the May Fourth Movement." I wanted to select one hundred important works since the May Fourth Movement, arrange them uniformly according to the content of the original books, publish them in installments, and compile them into a complete library for literary youths to access the revolutionary tradition of the May Fourth era from the works. But here is a big problem. Selecting one hundred kinds involves the rights and interests of dozens of publishers. Who would be willing to let you have the copyright? And at that time, most writers, due to the pressure of livelihood, sold the copyright of many works to the publisher with a one-time fee; even if the author retained the copyright, even if the author agreed, the original publisher would not agree to Liangyou including it in the library. In the old society, private publishers were too busy competing and fighting each other, how could they help you to complete a plan with a grand vision? A beautiful dream burst after a few days of excitement.
    Later, in conversations with editors and writers, someone thought that since it was difficult to reprint the original books, wouldn't selecting short stories into collections be not considered an infringement of other people's copyrights? This suggestion rekindled courage. So a preliminary plan was set: to find people to compile and select in several departments such as essays, novels, prose, poetry, drama, and historical materials. After many difficulties, ten compilers including Lu Xun, Mao Dun, and Zheng Zhenduo were finally appointed. But in order to make a summary of the new literature creation activities since the May Fourth Movement, there must be a period of time in order to have a common and unified scope of compilation and selection. Opinions on this issue differed at first, and there were also disputes. Finally, a decision was made based on a letter from Mr. Mao Dun. Mr. Mao Dun's letter said:
    "The 'May Fourth' is 1919, and the 'May 30th' is 1925, six years before and after. Although it seems very lively in the history of new literature, there are actually not many works. I think it is better to set it from the 'May Fourth' to the 'Northern Expedition', that is, 1919-1927, so as to divide modern Chinese literature into two periods, namely 'May Fourth' to 'Northern Expedition', and 'Northern Expedition to the present'...
    Originally, 'May Fourth' and 'May 30th' only represent 'milestones'. In fact, many important articles in the first 'Constructive Literary Theory' were published before 'May Fourth'. There is no problem with a ten-year cut-off from 1917 to 1927."
    This set of books took two years to be published after breaking through the gate of the Kuomintang Review Committee; that is the ten-volume "Compendium of New Chinese Literature" that everyone sees today; the advertisement at the time of publication used a subtitle: "Summary of the First Ten Years of the New Literature Movement 1917-1927". A total of six thousand copies were issued.

    编辑忆旧
    ——关于中国新文学大系
    赵家璧
    作为一个文艺书籍的编辑工作者，我最爱收集世界各国的文学艺术方面的新书目录。学力、时间、金钱都不容许你饱览原书，但是就从翻不尽的书名，数不清的作者里，每次像踏进了一座堆满新书的藏书楼，心旷神怡，目不闲接。看到自己爱好的作者出版了新书，更像见到老朋友写成了新作品一样的高兴。而更大的愉快，还在乎从这些目录中常常能得到一些意外的启发，因而触动了脑筋，想到一些新鲜的选题。
    最近国际书店新成立了查目室，琳琅满目地准备了国外出版社的许多新书目录，那些五色缤纷的目录封面把我深深地吸引住了。其中日本的目录最使我感兴趣。文学艺术部门的书目中，足有几十套规模巨大的全集、大系、文库、集成等，多者数百卷，少者一、二十卷。每套书都能看出包容着编辑者的匠心，是先有了一个明确的编辑意图，然后大规模组织作者合力完成的；不仅是把许多作家的作品杂凑在一起而已；而编排装帧，也自成一格。日本的编辑出版工作过去曾给我以影响，今天又接触到这方面新鲜的资料，不由得不想起二十多年前的一些旧事来了。
    1933年，上海北四川路底有一家专售日文书的内山书店，我那时担任良友图书公司的编辑，因为常常有事到书店去找鲁迅先生，虽然不懂日文，也喜欢到书架上去浏览。有一次，内山先生送了我几本日本的新书目录。目录中有一套日本创作文学的文库，按时代先后编成完整的一套。当时正值国民党提倡复古运动，叫青年学生尊孔读经；进步的文化人却认为应当继承和发扬“五四”运动的革命传统，才能拯救中国。“五四”运动离开那时不过十多年，但是许多代表作品已不见流传，文学青年要找这些材料同古书一样要跑旧书摊。日本的文库计划就触动了我要出版一个“五四以来文学名著百种”的念头。我想把“五四”以来的重要著作选出一百种，按原书内容，统一编排，分期出版，编成一套完整的文库，以供文学青年从作品中接触到“五四”时代的革命传统。但这里有一个大难题。选一百种，要牵涉到十数家出版社的权益，谁愿意把版权让给你呢？而当时大部分作家，因迫于生计，许多作品都是以一次稿酬卖绝版权给出版社的；即或作者保留版权，作者同意了，原出版者也不会答应良友编入文库。在旧社会里，私营出版社之间互相竞争倾轧之不暇，怎有协助你去完成一个计划的宏量？一个美好的幻梦，兴奋了几天也就破灭了。
    此后在编辑部和作家们的谈话中，有人想到重印原书既有困难，选编短篇成集，不是可以不作侵害他人著作权论的吗？这一个建议重新鼓起了勇气。于是定下初步计划，分论文、小说、散文、诗、戏剧、史料等几个部门分头找人编选，经过很多困难，才约定了鲁迅、茅盾、郑振铎等十位编选人。但是既要替“五四”以来的新文学创作活动作一个总结，必得在时间上有个段落，才能有一个共同的统一的编选范围。这个问题起初看法各异，也有争论，最后还是根据茅盾先生的一封信作出了决定。茅盾先生的来信里是这样说的：
    “‘五四’是1919年，‘五卅’是1925年，前后六年，这六年虽
    然在新文学史上好像热闹得很，其实作品并不多。弟以为不如定
    自‘五四’到‘北伐’，即1919—1927，如此则把现代中国文学
    分为两个时期，即‘五四’到‘北伐’，‘北伐到现在’。……
    本来‘五四’‘五卅’不过表示了‘里程碑’，事实上，第一本
    的‘建设的文学理论’，就有许多重要文章是发表在‘五四’以
    前。从1917到1927，十年断代是并没有毛病的。”
    这套书先后经过两年时间，冲破了国民党审查会的鬼门关才算全部出版；那就是今天大家所看到的十卷本“中国新文学大系”；出版时的广告上曾用了一个副题：“新文学运动第一个十年的总结1917—1927”。先后共发行六千部。
