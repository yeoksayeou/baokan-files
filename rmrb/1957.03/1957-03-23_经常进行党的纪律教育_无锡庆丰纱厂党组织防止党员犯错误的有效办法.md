　　Frequent Party Discipline Education
　　——An Effective Method for the Wuxi Qingfeng Yarn Factory Party Organization to Prevent Party Members from Making Mistakes
　　Bian Jinhan, Qian Wenjian
　　Within our Party, continuously educating Party members, especially new Party members, on Party discipline is an active method to strengthen Party discipline and prevent and reduce Party members from making mistakes. The Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Wuxi Qingfeng Textile Factory has gained experience in this area while carrying out Party supervision work.
　　The Qingfeng Textile Factory has 829 Party members, more than 90% of whom joined the Party after 1949. Although the vast majority of Party members are active participants in various mass movements, have undergone certain tests, and have a relatively high level of awareness, because they have not joined the Party for long, have received little Party education, and lack sufficient Party spirit cultivation. Therefore, some Party members, although they have joined the Party organizationally, still retain various non-proletarian thoughts ideologically, and their sense of organization and discipline is generally insufficient. They are concerned with personal gains and losses, pursue personal enjoyment, and are passive and lazy in their work; they do not faithfully implement state plans, engage in deception, and seek to obtain honors by fraud; they are arrogant and complacent, create disunity, and engage in morally corrupt behavior. Such erroneous thoughts and behaviors are not uncommon among Party members. According to a survey, as many as 72 Party members have created disunity due to departmentalism and arrogance; some individual Party members even reach out to the Party for positions and treatment, and when the Party cannot meet their demands, they stop working and spread rumors everywhere. At that time, the factory's Party organization did not pay enough attention to internal Party education and failed to criticize and correct these shortcomings and errors in a timely manner, which allowed some Party members' errors to grow, and some Party members were therefore subjected to Party disciplinary action.
　　Later, the Qingfeng Yarn Factory's Supervisory Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Factory Supervisory Committee), under the unified leadership of the Factory Party Committee, actively adopted various methods to educate Party members on Party discipline in response to this situation within the Party.
　　One of the educational methods is to organize Party members to study the instructions of higher-level Party committees and supervisory committees, as well as circulars on major cases, to conduct vivid and specific discipline education for Party members. For example, by conveying the spirit of the First National Party Supervision Work Conference and the Jiangsu Provincial Industrial and Mining Party Supervision Work Symposium, Party members initially recognized the importance of Party supervision work and improved their awareness. After listening to the briefing, Party member Lin A'mei approached the branch to confess her past mistakes. In the third quarter of 1956, after the Party committee organized all Party members to study the circular from the Wuxi Municipal Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Communist Party regarding certain Party members of the Wuxi Tongyi Cloth Factory who falsely reported achievements, fraudulently obtained honors and bonuses, the reeling and bobbin workshops exposed and criticized mass-based fraudulent behaviors such as filling good yarn bundles with bad yarn bundles and filling good bobbins with bad bobbins.
　　The second educational method is to conduct education and correction in Party classes on relatively common disciplinary violations among Party members in each period, in order to prevent problems before they arise. For example, the General Branch of the Office found that the phenomenon of Party members creating disunity was relatively serious in the third quarter of last year, so it gave two Party classes on the topics of "Party Unity is the Life of the Party" and "Communist Party Members Should Consciously Carry Out Self-Transformation," and then held group discussions. After the education, the unhealthy tendency of Party members to create disunity was corrected.
　　This education has played a positive role in overcoming and stopping erroneous tendencies within the Party, safeguarding Party discipline, improving Party members' awareness, and strengthening Party members' discipline, and has also encouraged Party members' enthusiasm and creativity.
　　To educate Party members on Party discipline, Party organizations need to conduct frequent and arduous investigation and research work to understand the situation of Party members' compliance with Party discipline. Only by grasping the specific situation can discipline education hit the nail on the head and solve problems. The Qingfeng Yarn Factory Supervisory Committee guides the supervisory staff of the General Branch and Branches to understand the situation of Party members' violations of Party discipline from the ideological situation of Party members regularly investigated by the organization and publicity departments, and regularly conducts comprehensive analysis and research. The Factory Supervisory Committee also maintains frequent contact with relevant departments such as the Supervisory Office; participates in the monthly meetings convened by the factory director to check production plans and analyze economic activities, from which it understands the problems existing in Party members' implementation of Party policies and completion of production plans; and attaches importance to letters and visits from the masses of workers, from which it discovers various disciplinary violations of Party members. Only by conducting investigations and research from multiple perspectives can we grasp the situation in a more timely manner, educate Party members in a timely manner, and ensure the continuous strengthening of Party discipline.

　　经常进行党的纪律教育
　　——无锡庆丰纱厂党组织防止党员犯错误的有效办法
　　卞进翰　钱文剑
    在我们党内，对于党员，尤其是新党员，不断地进行党的纪律教育，这是加强党的纪律、防止和减少党员犯错误的积极方法。中共无锡市庆丰纺织厂监察委员会在进行党的监察工作中取得了这一方面的经验。
    庆丰纺织厂共有党员八百二十九人，其中90％以上是1949年以后入党的。虽然绝大多数的党员都是各项群众运动中的积极分子，经过一定的考验，有较高的觉悟程度，但由于他们参加党不久，受到党的教育少，党性锻炼不够。因此，有些党员虽然在组织上入了党，但是在思想上仍然保留着种种非无产阶级的思想，组织性、纪律性一般都不够，计较个人得失，追求个人享受，工作消极疲塌；不忠实执行国家计划，弄虚作假，骗取荣誉；骄傲自满，闹不团结以及败坏道德等等错误思想行为，在党员中并不少见。据调查，在党员中因为本位主义、自高自大而闹不团结的，即有七十二人之多；有个别党员还伸手向党要地位，要待遇，当党不能满足他的要求的时候，就不干工作，到处散布流言蜚语。那时，厂的党组织对党内的教育工作还重视的不够，没有及时批判和纠正这些缺点和错误，致使有些党员的错误得以滋长，有的党员因此受到了党的纪律处分。
    以后，庆丰纱厂党的监察委员会（以下简称厂监委），在厂党委的统一领导下，针对党内的这种状况，积极地采取各种方法，向党员进行党的纪律教育。
    教育的办法之一是组织党员学习上级党委、监委的指示和重大案件的通报，向党员进行生动、具体的纪律教育。如通过传达全国第一次党的监察工作会议和江苏省工矿党的监察工作座谈会议的精神，使党员初步认识了党的监察工作的重要性，提高了觉悟。党员林阿梅听了传达以后，就找支部交代了过去的错误。1956年第三季度中，党委组织全体党员学习了中共无锡市监察委员会关于无锡市同亿布厂某些党员谎报成绩、骗取荣誉和奖金的通报后，摇纱、筒子两个车间就揭发批判了带有群众性的以坏纱团充好纱团、以坏筒子充好筒子的弄虚作假行为。
    教育的办法之二是对每个时期党员中存在的比较普遍的违反纪律倾向，在党课中进行教育纠正，以防微杜渐。如科室总支在去年第三季度中发现党员闹不团结的现象比较严重，就先后以“党的团结就是党的生命”和“共产党员要自觉地进行自我改造”为内容，上了两次党课，然后分组讨论。经过教育，党员中闹不团结的不良倾向得到了纠正。
    这种教育对克服和制止党内的错误倾向、维护党的纪律、提高党员觉悟、加强党员的纪律性都起了积极的作用，并且鼓舞了党员的积极性和创造性。
    向党员进行党的纪律教育，党组织须要经常地做艰苦的调查研究工作，了解党员遵守党的纪律的状况，只有掌握了具体情况，纪律教育才能击中要害，解决问题。庆丰纱厂监委指导总支、支部的监察工作人员从组织、宣传部门定期调查的党员思想情况中了解党员违反党的纪律的情况，定期进行综合分析研究。厂监委还同监察室等有关部门经常联系；参加厂长每月召开的检查生产计划和经济活动分析会议，从中了解党员在执行党的政策和完成生产计划中存在的问题；重视职工群众的来信来访，从中发现党员的各种违反纪律情况。只有从多方面进行调查研究，才能够比较及时地掌握情况，及时地对党员进行教育，保证党的纪律的不断加强。
