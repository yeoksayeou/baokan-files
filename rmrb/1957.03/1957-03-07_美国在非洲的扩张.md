    U.S. Expansion in Africa
    Lù Guǒmù
    U.S. Vice President Nixon has arrived in the Gold Coast in West Africa from the United States to attend Ghana's independence ceremony. Before arriving in the Gold Coast, Nixon had been active in Morocco; and after the independence ceremony in Ghana, he will visit Liberia, Uganda, Ethiopia, Sudan, Libya, and Tunisia. Even U.S. President Eisenhower admitted that Nixon's "17,800-mile" long trip to Africa was "far more than a courtesy visit." In Morocco, Nixon discussed with Moroccan authorities Eisenhower's Middle East plan, U.S. air bases in Morocco, and so-called economic "aid" from the United States to Morocco. At the same time, some departments of the U.S. government are strengthening their penetration into Africa. The U.S. Information Service recently announced that it would strengthen the "Voice of America's" radio propaganda to Africa; the U.S. State Department also revealed: "All our diplomatic missions in Africa are being universally strengthened." These facts show that Nixon's trip to Africa is a signal of further U.S. expansion into Africa.
    Africa is the second largest continent in the world after Asia, with an area of approximately 30 million square kilometers, equivalent to three Europes. As early as the late nineteenth century, this vast land had been divided up by European colonial countries – Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Spain, and others. The rising U.S. imperialism did not seize colonies in Africa, but during World War II, the United States took the opportunity to expand its influence in Africa. Since the war, the United States has been infiltrating Africa on an even larger scale. According to U.S. Department of Commerce statistics, U.S. direct investment in Africa has increased from $352.2 million in 1950 to $774 million in 1955. This figure does not include so-called "aid" funds from the U.S. government. This shows that U.S. monopoly groups are eager to have a hand in the "development of the black continent." Some people in the United States even regard Africa as America's "last frontier."
    The U.S. invasion of Africa began first in the military field. As early as World War II, the United States saw the strategic importance of Africa, and therefore actively established its own military bases in Africa. In 1942, the United States began to build naval and air bases in Liberia, thereby controlling this West African black republic. Subsequently, the United States successively established a large number of military bases in Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Libya, Dakar, Nigeria, and Eritrea. After the war, due to protests from the African people, the United States abandoned some bases, but to this day, the United States still maintains many military bases in Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Libya, and other places. Some of these were newly established after the war. Moreover, Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, has become a "permanent military base" for the United States. In addition, in recent years, the United States has also been building military airports and strategic highways in Ethiopia, the Belgian Congo, and other places to further expand into various parts of Africa.
    While expanding militarily, the United States has also increasingly strengthened its economic penetration into Africa. Because Africa is not only vast in area, but also rich in resources, especially in huge amounts of various important strategic raw materials. For example, Africa accounts for 99% of the world's production of columbite-tantalite, 98.4% of diamonds, 80.1% of cobalt, 58.9% of gold, 30.8% of chromite, 29.4% of manganese ore, 19.4% of vanadium, 18.2% of copper, 15.3% of tin, and especially the uranium reserves in the Belgian Congo, which account for 60% to 80% of the world's total. These strategic raw materials are urgently needed by the United States, which is constantly expanding its arms and preparing for war. No wonder that a year ago, one of the heads of the U.S. monopoly groups, Nelson Rockefeller, specifically pointed out in a confidential letter to U.S. President Eisenhower: "We should not ignore this important fact: virtually all of our natural rubber, manganese, chromium, tin, a large part of our zinc, copper, petroleum, and a third or more of the lead and aluminum we need come from abroad, and mainly from the underdeveloped regions of Africa and Asia... The situation is the same for a large part of our 'super strategic materials' (especially uranium ore)." Last year's report from the U.S. House of Representatives Africa study group also emphasized: "Africa is rich in inexhaustible raw material resources, almost all of which are important to us... We want to obtain the raw materials of this continent, especially to ensure our minimum strategic needs." It is thus clear that Africa's rich resources have become an important target of plunder for U.S. imperialism.
    In fact, U.S. monopoly capital has gradually penetrated into the main resource sectors of various parts of Africa. In the past decade or so since the war, many important minerals in Africa have successively fallen under the control of U.S. capital. For example, the uranium mines in the Congo were originally under the joint control of British and American capital, but in 1950, the United States used pressure to acquire 600,000 shares belonging to the British Tanganyika Company, thereby obtaining all the mining rights and products of uranium. At present, the uranium mine production in the Congo has all fallen under the control of U.S. monopoly capital, including "Ladenburg Thalmann & Co.", "New York LaSalle Brothers Co.", and "David Rockefeller & Co.". The manganese mines in the Gold Coast, which account for the third largest production in the world, are also completely controlled by the U.S. "Minerals and Chemicals Corporation of America". The situation in Liberia is the same, with the U.S. "Stettinius Liberia Corporation" and the "Liberia Mining Company" organized by American consortia controlling Liberia's iron ore production; Liberia's rubber production is also monopolized by the U.S. "Firestone Tire and Rubber Company." Many mineral deposits in Ethiopia have been seized by the U.S. "Newmont Mining Corporation" and "St. Joseph Lead Company." As early as 1945, the U.S. "Sinclair Oil Corporation" obtained a fifty-year patent for exploring and exploiting Ethiopian oil. The aforementioned U.S. "Newmont Mining Corporation" and "St. Joseph Lead Company" also control half of Morocco's tin production. Morocco's cobalt is also entirely controlled by U.S. capital. Morocco's oil is mainly controlled by the U.S. "Standard Oil Company of New Jersey" and "Standard Oil Company of New York." The U.S. "Mobil Oil Algeria" controls Algeria's oil resources. In Tunisia, the U.S. "Gulf Oil Corporation" has obtained the right to exploit important oil areas. South Africa, the world's largest gold-producing country, has always been entirely controlled by British capital in the past. But since World War II, U.S. capital has also widely invaded South Africa. In 1943, U.S. investment in South Africa was only $9.9 million, while in 1955 it reached $257 million, an increase of twenty-five times. In order to accelerate the expansion of uranium production in South Africa, in 1953, the U.S. "Export-Import Bank" specially lent the South African government $54 million. The U.S. "General Electric Company," "Studebaker Corporation," and "Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company" have all established branches in South Africa.
    The result of the large-scale penetration of U.S. monopoly capital into Africa has made the contradictions between the U.S., Britain, and France in their scramble for Africa increasingly acute. Because U.S. capital goes mainly to British and French colonies or "spheres of influence." These regions have been, and still are, the "lifelines" of British and French imperialism. For example, the Union of South Africa and the Gold Coast have been under British rule for decades, and British monopoly groups will certainly not easily give up these positions from which they extract huge profits. For another example, Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria in North Africa were all French colonies in the past. Although Morocco and Tunisia are now independent, French monopoly capital still occupies a dominant position there. According to a 1953 report in the French weekly "Economic Notes and Studies," most of the mining industry in the above three regions is still controlled by French trusts. In the iron ore sector alone, French capital accounts for 95% in Morocco, 84% in Tunisia, and 75% in Algeria. The French monopoly capital newspaper "Echo de l'Oranie - La Libre France" once said: "We will never give up our colonies in North Africa to anyone." It is thus clear that further U.S. capital penetration into Africa will inevitably cause dissatisfaction and opposition from British and French imperialism.
    It is worth noting that a new situation has emerged in Africa in recent years. The old colonial rule is shaking, and national independence movements are surging. On January 1, last year, Sudan officially declared its independence. By March, Morocco and Tunisia also became independent countries one after another. Now the Gold Coast has also announced its formation as the Republic of Ghana. This situation reflects that the people of African countries no longer want to live as they did before, and the days of colonial rule in Africa are numbered. However, U.S. imperialism regards this new situation as a great opportunity to expand its influence. In June 1956, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern, South Asian, and African Affairs George Allen openly described the newly independent countries of Africa as "political vacuums." Two months later, the report of the U.S. House of Representatives Africa Study Group also stated: "We no longer have to deal with a large part of Africa through the colonial powers. In the future, we will establish relations directly with the local residents of Africa." These U.S. official remarks fully expose that U.S. imperialism is planning to replace the British and French colonial countries to fill the so-called "political vacuum" in Africa. Nixon's mission to Africa this time further confirms this expansionist ambition of U.S. imperialism. While in Morocco, Nixon publicly said that although the "Eisenhower Doctrine" "technically" did not include Tunisia and Morocco, he believed that the plan "did not need" to be limited to the "traditionally" Middle East region. No wonder the Moroccan "Al Alam" pointed out that Nixon was there to promote the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Recently, U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Green also advocated: "It is in the United States' own interest to assist the Moroccans in the early days of Morocco's independence through long-term loans or encouraging American private capital investment." It is foreseeable that as the United States further penetrates, the struggle between the U.S., Britain, and France for Africa will become more acute.
    U.S. imperialism and its British and French rivals have all put on a pretense of "developing" Africa in order to further plunder and exploit the African people. However, the African people have awakened. They do not want to be oppressed by British and French colonial empires, let alone the "invisible" colonial enslavement by the United States. Africa will eventually become "Africa for Africans"!

    美国在非洲的扩张
    陆果木
    美国副总统尼克松已从美国到达西非的黄金海岸，参加加纳的独立典礼。在到达黄金海岸之前，尼克松曾在摩洛哥进行了一番活动；并且在加纳的独立典礼之后，他还要到利比里亚、乌干达、埃塞俄比亚、苏丹、利比亚和突尼斯等处访问。尼克松这次“一万七千八百英里”的非洲长途旅行计划，连美国总统艾森豪威尔也承认“远不止是礼节上的访问”。尼克松在摩洛哥就曾与摩洛哥当局讨论了艾森豪威尔的中东计划、摩洛哥境内的美国空军基地，以及美国对摩洛哥进行所谓经济“援助”等问题。与此同时，美国政府的一些部门，正在加强对非洲的渗入。美国新闻处最近就宣布要加强“美国之音”对非洲的广播宣传；美国国务院也透露：“我们在非洲的所有外交机构正在进行普遍的加强。”这些事实表明：尼克松的非洲之行是美国进一步向非洲扩张的信号。
    非洲是世界上仅次于亚洲的第二个大陆，它的面积约有三千万平方公里，等于三个欧洲。早在十九世纪末叶，这块广阔的土地已被欧洲殖民国家——英、法、意、比、葡、西等国瓜分殆尽。后起的美国帝国主义没有在非洲抢到殖民地，但在第二次世界大战期间，美国曾乘机扩张了自己在非洲的势力。战后以来，美国更加大规模地在非洲进行渗入。据美国商务部统计：美国在非洲的直接投资，已从1950年的三亿五千二百万美元增加为1955年的七亿七千四百万美元。这个数字还不包括美国政府的所谓“援助”款项。由此可见，美国垄断集团已迫不及待地要在“开发黑色大陆”事业中插上一手。美国的某些人甚至把非洲看作是美国的“最后的国界”。
    美国侵入非洲，首先是从军事方面着手的。还在第二次世界大战期间，美国就已看到非洲在战略上的重要意义，因此便积极在非洲建立自己的军事基地。1942年，美国开始在利比里亚建立海空军基地，从而控制了这个西非的黑人共和国。其后，美国连续在摩洛哥、突尼斯、阿尔及利亚、利比亚、达喀尔、尼日利亚和厄立特里亚等地大批建立军事基地。战后，由于非洲人民的抗议，美国虽曾放弃了某些基地，但直到现在，美国仍在摩洛哥、突尼斯、阿尔及利亚、利比亚等地保留着许多军事基地。其中有些还是在战后新建立的。而且，利比里亚首都蒙罗维亚已成为美国的“永久性军事基地”。此外，近几年来，美国还在埃塞俄比亚、比属刚果等地大事修建军用机场和战略公路，以便进一步向非洲各地进行扩张。
    在军事扩张的同时，美国也日益加强了它对非洲的经济渗入。因为非洲不仅地区辽阔，而且资源富饶，特别是蕴藏有巨量的各种重要战略原料。例如，非洲的钶铁矿占世界产量的99％，金刚石占98.4％，钴占80.1％，黄金占58.9％，铬铁石占30.8％，锰矿砂占29.4％，钒占19.4％，铜占18.2％，锡占15.3％，尤其是比属刚果的铀的藏量，占世界的60％至80％。这些战略原料，正是一贯扩军备战的美国所迫切需要的。无怪一年以前，美国垄断集团的头子之一——纳尔逊·洛克菲勒在写给美国总统艾森豪威尔的密信中就特别指出：“我们不应忽视这个重要的事实：实际上我们全部的天然橡胶、锰、铬、锡，我们很大部分的锌、铜、石油，以及我们所需的三分之一或者还多一些的铅和铝是从国外来的，而且主要是从非洲和亚洲的不发达地区来的。……我们的‘超级战略物资’（特别是铀矿）的很大一部分的情况也是这样”。去年发表的美国众院非洲考察团的报告书中也曾强调：“非洲蕴藏着取之不尽的原料资源，几乎全部都对我们有重要的作用……我们希望取得这块大陆的原料，特别是保证我们最低的战略方面的需要”。由此可见，非洲富饶的资源已成为美国帝国主义掠夺的重要目标。
    事实上，美国垄断资本已逐步渗入非洲各地的主要资源部门。战后十余年来，非洲的许多重要矿产先后落入美国资本控制之中。例如：刚果的铀矿，本来是在英、美资本联合控制之下的，但在1950年，美国使用压力收购了属于英国坦噶尼喀公司的六十万份股票，从而取得了铀的全部开采权及其产品。目前，刚果的铀矿生产已全部落在包括“拉登堡台尔曼公司”、“纽约拉萨尔兄弟公司”、“大卫·洛克菲勒公司”美国的垄断资本控制之下。产量占世界第三位的黄金海岸的锰矿也完全由美国“矿化物与碳联合康采恩”所控制。利比里亚的情况也一样，美国“斯退汀纽斯·利比里亚合作公司”和美国财团组织的“利比里亚矿业公司”控制了利比里亚的铁矿生产；利比里亚的橡胶生产也由美国“费尔斯通轮胎橡胶公司”一手垄断。埃塞俄比亚的许多矿藏，已被美国“纽蒙特矿业公司”、 “约瑟夫铅业公司”所攫取。美国“辛克莱石油公司”早在1945年就已获得了勘察和开采埃塞俄比亚石油的五十年专利权。上述的美国“纽蒙特矿业公司”和“约瑟夫铅业公司”还控制了摩洛哥锡的生产的一半。摩洛哥的钴，也全部已为美国资本所控制、摩洛哥的石油，主要由美国“新泽西美孚油公司”和“纽约美孚油公司”所控制。美国的“阿尔及利亚美孚油公司”控制了阿尔及利亚的石油资源。在突尼斯，美国“海湾石油公司”取得了重要石油区的开采权。世界最大的产金国——南非联邦，过去一直全由英国资本控制。但从第二次世界大战以来，美国资本也已广泛侵入南非。1943年，美国在南非的投资仅有九百九十万美元，而1955年已达二亿五千七百万美元，增加了二十五倍。为了加速扩大南非铀矿生产，1953年美国“进出口银行”还特地贷给南非政府五千四百万美元。美国“通用电气公司”、“史蒂培克公司”、“固特异橡胶公司”都已在南非设立了分公司。
    美国垄断资本大规模渗入非洲的结果，已使美、英、法争夺非洲的矛盾日益尖锐。因为，美国资本所到之处，主要是英法的殖民地或“势力范围”。这些地区，过去和现在都是英、法帝国主义的“生命线”。例如：南非联邦和黄金海岸，数十年来一直受英国统治，英国垄断集团当然不会轻易放弃这些榨取巨额利润的阵地。又如北非的摩洛哥、突尼斯和阿尔及利亚，过去都是法国的殖民地，现在摩洛哥、突尼斯虽已独立，但法国垄断资本在那里仍占优势地位。据1953年法国“经济札记与研究”周刊报道：上述三地的采矿工业大部分仍由法国托辣斯所控制。单就铁矿一项，法国资本在摩洛哥就占95％，在突尼斯占84％，在阿尔及利亚占75％。法国垄断资本的报纸“震旦—自由法兰西报”曾经说过：“我们决不把我们在北非的殖民地让给任何人。”由此可见，美国资本进一步渗入非洲，必然会引起英法帝国主义的不满和反对。
    值得注意的是，非洲近年来业已出现了一个新的局面，旧有的殖民统治日形动摇，民族独立运动风起云涌。去年1月1日，苏丹正式宣布独立。到了3月，摩洛哥和突尼斯也相继成为独立国家。现在黄金海岸也已宣布成为加纳共和国。这种情况正是反映了非洲各国人民再也不愿像从前那样生活下去了，殖民统治在非洲的日子不多了。但是，美国帝国主义却把这一新的局面视作扩展自己势力的大好机会。1956年6月，美国负责近东、南亚和非洲事务的助理国务卿乔治·艾伦曾经公开将非洲新独立的国家说成是“政治上的真空地带”。两月以后，美国众院非洲考察团的报告书中也说：“我们再也不必通过殖民宗主国家同非洲的一大部分地区打交道，今后我们将直接同非洲的当地居民建立关系。”这些美国官方的言论，充分暴露了美国帝国主义正打算接替英法殖民国家来填补所谓非洲的“政治真空”。尼克松这次出使非洲，更加证实了美国帝国主义这一扩张野心。尼克松在摩洛哥时就公开说，“艾森豪威尔主义”虽然“从技术上说”不包括突尼斯和摩洛哥，但他认为这个计划“没有必要”只局限于“传统意义上的”中东地区。无怪摩洛哥的“旗帜报”指出：尼克松是去推销“艾森豪威尔主义”的。日前，美国参议院外交委员会主席格林也在鼓吹：“在摩洛哥获得独立的早期，通过长期贷款或者鼓励美国私人资本投资来援助摩洛哥人是符合美国自己的利益的。”可以预见，随着美国的进一步渗入，美英法争夺非洲的斗争将更加尖锐起来。
    美国帝国主义和它的英法对手都已摆出一副“开发”非洲的面目，来进一步掠夺和压榨非洲人民。但是，非洲人民已经觉醒起来了，他们既不愿受英法殖民帝国的压迫，更不要美国“无形”的殖民奴役。非洲终将成为“非洲人的非洲”！
