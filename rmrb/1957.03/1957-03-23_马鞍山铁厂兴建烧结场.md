Xinhua News Agency report: Ma'anshan Iron Works recently started construction of a sintering plant.

The Ma'anshan Iron Mine contains a large amount of iron powder with high iron content. However, due to the small particle size, it is not suitable for blast furnace smelting requirements, and has been shelved for a long time and cannot be utilized. After the sintering plant is completed, it will be possible to re-sinter the large amount of iron powder mined from various mines and left over from the past into useful ore.

    马鞍山铁厂兴建烧结场
    据新华社讯　马鞍山铁厂最近动工兴建一座烧结场。
    马鞍山铁矿中有大量含铁量较高的粉矿，但由于块度太小，不适合于高炉冶炼的要求，长期被搁置无法利用。烧结场建成以后，就可以把各个矿山开采出来的和过去遗留下来的大量粉矿，重新烧结成有用的矿石。
