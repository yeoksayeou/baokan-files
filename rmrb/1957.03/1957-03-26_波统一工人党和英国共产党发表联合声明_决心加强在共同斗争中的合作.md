Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 25th: The Polish Press Agency reported on March 25th that after holding talks in Warsaw from March 20th to 23rd, the delegation of the Polish United Workers' Party and the delegation of the British Communist Party issued a joint statement.

The statement said that one of the extremely important tasks facing the international working-class movement in the current situation is to carry out a common struggle to ease international tensions, achieve peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, end the dangerous division of Europe by establishing a European collective security system, and strive for gradual disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and missiles.

The result of this struggle, like the solution of all other historical tasks facing the working class, largely depends on the unity of all socialist forces, the concerted action of communist and workers' parties of all countries, and the unity of the socialist family of nations. In this family, the Soviet Union plays a particularly important role in terms of the experience of socialist construction and the development of socialist forces.

The statement pointed out that the two parties welcome the great and historically significant progress made by colonies and dependent countries in their struggle for liberation, condemn all interference, conspiracies, and other activities aimed at suppressing national liberation movements, and believe that all of this violates the principle of national self-determination and threatens world peace.

The statement said that German militarism once caused great suffering to the people of both Poland and the United Kingdom. Therefore, both parties oppose the rearmament of West Germany, especially the action of clamoring to equip the new Nazi "Defense Force" with atomic weapons. The two parties demand the unification of Germany based on the principles of peace and democracy and support the efforts of the German Democratic Republic to achieve this goal. The two parties emphatically point out that plans for the establishment of a "European Common Market" and "European Atomic Energy Community" would deepen the danger of European division and would create conditions for German monopoly capital to establish hegemony in Western Europe.

The two parties fully support the Soviet Union's peace efforts, especially its recent proposals on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, which fully take into account the opinions of Western countries.

The two parties declare the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to be a turning point in the history of the international working-class movement. The congress opened up new prospects for the struggle for peace and socialism, and by criticizing the deviations related to the personality cult, established Leninist principles within and between the communist parties of various countries and in the relations between socialist countries.

The relationship between communist parties and workers' parties and the relationship between socialist countries are based on the principles of equality, non-interference in internal affairs, and respect for sovereignty. This is a necessary prerequisite for creatively applying the general principles of Marxism-Leninism in accordance with the specific conditions of each country. This both enriches the experience of the international working-class movement and consolidates its unity. This is the purpose of the Soviet government's declaration of October 30, 1956, the People's Republic of China's statement of November 1, 1956, and the Polish-Soviet statement of November 18, 1956.

The two parties condemn all attempts to revise the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, reconcile class struggle, and weaken the principles of democratic centralism and the solidarity of communist parties and workers' parties.

The two parties emphasize that no matter how different the methods, forms, and paths of socialist construction in different countries may be, they cannot violate the basic principles of socialism, namely, the leading role of the party and the regime of the working people. Therefore, the two parties resolutely oppose all attempts to violate these basic principles and dogmatically and mechanically transplant the experience of one party or one socialist country to another party or another socialist country.

The statement pointed out that the British Communist Party supports the Polish United Workers' Party's activities to correct past mistakes, strengthen ties with the masses on the basis of Leninist principles, and build socialism taking into account Poland's current conditions. The Polish United Workers' Party supports the British Communist Party's program of "Britain's Road to Socialism" and the British Communist Party's policy and work to unite the British workers' movement.

The British Communist Party and the Polish United Workers' Party will launch a struggle against anti-Soviet propaganda, against all forms of chauvinism and nationalism, and against all forms of anti-Semitism, national discrimination, and racial discrimination.

The statement concludes by pointing out that guided by the principles of proletarian internationalism and linked together by the common struggle for peace and socialism, the two parties are determined to strengthen their cooperation in all aspects for the benefit of the working people of Poland and the United Kingdom.

　　波统一工人党和英国共产党发表联合声明
　　决心加强在共同斗争中的合作
    新华社华沙25日电　据波兰通讯社25日报道，波兰统一工人党代表团和英国共产党代表团3月20日到23日在华沙举行会谈后，发表了一项联合声明。
    声明说，国际工人阶级运动在目前局势下所面临的一项极为重要的任务是要进行共同的斗争，争取缓和国际紧张局势，实现具有不同社会制度各国的和平共处，通过建立欧洲集体安全体系来结束欧洲危险的分裂状态，争取逐步裁军和禁止原子武器、氢武器和导弹。
    这一斗争的结果，同工人阶级所面临的其他一切历史任务的解决一样，在很大程度上取决于一切社会主义力量的团结，各国共产党和工人党的行动一致和社会主义国家大家庭的团结。在这个大家庭中，就社会主义建设的经验和社会主义力量的发展来说，苏联起着特别重要的作用。
    声明指出，两党欢迎殖民地和附属国在争取解放方面所取得的伟大的具有历史意义的进展，谴责为了压制民族解放运动而进行的一切干涉、阴谋和其他活动，认为这一切是违反民族自决原则和威胁世界和平的。
    声明说，德国军国主义曾经使波兰和英国两国人民遭受重大的苦难，因此，两党都反对重新武装西德，特别反对扬言要以原子武器装配新的纳粹“国防军”的那种行动。两党要求根据和平和民主的原则统一德国，支持德意志民主共和国为了达到这种目的而进行的努力。两党着重地指明，关于成立“欧洲共同市场”和“欧洲原子能联营机构”的那种计划，会加深欧洲分裂的危险，并且会创造条件使德国垄断资本在西欧建立起霸权。
    两党完全支持苏联所进行的和平努力，特别是它最近就裁军和禁止原子武器问题所提出的建议，这种建议充分考虑到了西方国家的意见。
    两党宣称，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会是国际工人阶级运动史中的一个转折点。这次代表大会为争取和平和社会主义的斗争展开了新的前景，并且批判了与个人崇拜有关的偏向，从而在各国共产党内部以及各国共产党之间和各社会主义国家之间的关系中树立起来了列宁主义原则。
    共产党和工人党之间的关系以及社会主义国家之间的关系建立在平等、互不干涉内部事务和尊重主权的原则的基础上，这是根据每一个国家的具体条件创造性地运用马克思列宁主义一般原则的必要前提。这一方面丰富国际工人阶级运动的经验，另一方面又巩固它的团结。这就是苏联政府1956年10月30日的宣言、中华人民共和国1956年11月1日的声明以及1956年11月18日波苏声明的宗旨。
    两党谴责修正马克思列宁主义基本原则、调和阶级斗争的一切企图以及削弱民主集中制原则和共产党及工人党团结的一切企图。
    两党强调指出，不同国家进行社会主义建设的方法、形式和道路不论怎样不同，它们不能够违反社会主义基本原则，即劳动人民的政党和政权的领导作用。因此，两党坚决反对违反这些基本原则以及教条地、机械地把某一个党或某一个社会主义国家的经验硬搬到另一个党或另一个社会主义国家的一切企图。
    声明指出，英国共产党支持波兰统一工人党为了纠正过去错误，在列宁主义原则的基础上加强同群众的联系和在考虑到波兰当前条件的情况下建设社会主义的各种活动。波兰统一工人党支持英国共产党的“英国走向社会主义的道路”的纲领和英国共产党为了统一英国工人运动的政策和工作。
    英国共产党和波兰统一工人党将展开反对反苏宣传，反对一切形式的沙文主义和民族主义、一切形式的反犹太主义和民族歧视和种族歧视的斗争。
    声明最后指出，两党以无产阶级国际主义原则为指导，并且由争取和平和社会主义的共同斗争联结在一起，决心要为波兰和英国劳动人民的利益而加强它们在各方面的合作。
