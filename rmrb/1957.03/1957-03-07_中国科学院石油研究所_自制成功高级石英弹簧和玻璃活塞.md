    The Petroleum Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences: Successfully Manufactures Advanced Quartz Springs and Glass Pistons.
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Liu Xingxin, a glass craftsman at the Petroleum Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has successfully manufactured advanced quartz springs and glass pistons for the "physical adsorption vacuum device." This quartz spring is an indispensable device for determining the amount of gas adsorbed by a solid during a chemical reaction. It can indicate minute changes, and the spring itself is not easily deformed at high temperatures. The glass piston can maintain the high vacuum system during experiments, with almost no air leakage.
    On February 22, a researcher at the institute guided a reporter on a tour of two laboratories equipped with the "physical adsorption vacuum device." The thin quartz wire forming the spring emitted a crystalline luster within several long glass tubes. A tiny glass weighing pan was suspended from the lower end of the spring, with the contents of the pan being so small as to be almost invisible. Glass pistons were used in many places in this set of equipment. Two female research interns who were managing the experiment immediately demonstrated their advantages to the reporter. They said that before the quartz springs were officially used in experimental work, they had carefully tested the accuracy of the weighing. When they placed weights on the quartz weighing pan suspended at the lower end, from 0.1 grams to 1.4 grams, the extension of the quartz spring accurately indicated the weight of the weights. When the weights were removed from the weighing pan, the spring accurately returned to its original length. They said that the experiments they were currently conducting required a high degree of vacuum, and the glass pistons made by Liu Xingxin met the needs of this experiment. In the experiment, the highest vacuum degree of this glass piston reached ten to the minus fourth power (almost a perfect vacuum).
    The researcher told the reporter: Last August, when the quartz springs and glass pistons were first successfully trial-produced, several scientific workers who had recently returned from abroad expressed disbelief that we could make such high-level experimental equipment ourselves. After they visited the Petroleum Institute, they were completely convinced.
    The researcher also took the reporter to visit many kinds of experimental equipment self-made by Liu Xingxin and other eight glass workers, such as precision fractionation columns, distillation columns, and adsorption columns. He said that without these equipment, our scientific research could not be carried out. Equipment such as quartz springs and glass pistons are also difficult to buy in foreign markets.

    自制成功高级石英弹簧和玻璃活塞
    新华社讯　中国科学院石油研究所玻璃细工刘兴信自制成功了“物理吸附真空装置”里的高级石英弹簧和玻璃活塞。这种石英弹簧是测定化学反应过程中固体对气体吸附量的不可缺少的装置，它能指示出微小的量的变化，弹簧本身在高温下也不易变形；玻璃活塞可维持高真空系统的实验在实验过程中，几乎完全没有空气。
    2月22日，这个研究所的一位研究人员引导记者参观了两个设有
  “物理吸附真空装置”的实验室，细细的石英丝绕成的弹簧在几根长玻璃管里发出晶莹的光泽，弹簧的下端吊着一个微小的玻璃称盘，盘中的盛物小得几乎看不清楚了，在这套装置上，好多地方都用了玻璃活塞。两个正在管理实验的女研究实习员立刻向记者证明了它们的优点。她们说，石英弹簧在正式运用于实验工作以前，她们曾仔细地作了测重准确性的试验。当她们把法码放到吊在下端的石英称盘上，从零点一克一直加到一点四克的时候，石英弹簧的延伸，准确地指示出法码的重量；法码从称盘中被拿开时，弹簧又准确地恢复了它原来的长度。她们说，她们现在做的实验要求高度的真空，刘兴信做的玻璃活塞满足了这个实验的需要。在实验中，这种玻璃活塞的最高真空度曾达到十的负四次方（几乎是完全真空）。
    这位研究人员向记者说：去年8月，初次试制成功石英弹簧和玻璃活塞时，曾经有好几个回国不久的科学工作者，对我们自己能做出这样高的实验设备来表示不信，当他们到石油研究所参观过以后，就完全信服了。
    这位研究人员还带记者参观了刘兴信等八个玻璃工人自制的精密分馏柱、蒸馏柱、吸附柱等许多种实验设备，他说，没有这些设备，我们的科学研究就无法进行，像石英弹簧、玻璃活塞等设备，在国外市场也很难买到。
