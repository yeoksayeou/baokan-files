  Colorful River Water in Suzhou
  People in Suzhou often see the water in the Shantang River, when passing through Changmen and walking on Duseng Bridge, as red, green, and ever-changing.

    This colorful river water is not naturally occurring but is manufactured by the Suzhou No. 2 Refining and Dyeing Cooperative. This cooperative has never utilized the "waste dye water" after dyeing. Every day, it discharges the so-called "waste water" containing a lot of dye. This wastewater dyes the river in various colors.

    This waste not only costs the cooperative about 2,000 yuan a year but also affects the lives of nearby residents. Whenever residents wash clothes or rice, the discharged colored water stains the clothes and rice. It is hoped that the cooperative will quickly correct this practice.

    Unattended Cement
    At the Juanyangdao Wharf upstream of the Fozi Ridge Reservoir, forty bags (two tons) of cement have been left unattended. For more than eight months, they have been exposed to wind and rain, and most of them have solidified and become useless waste.

    Which unit does this batch of cement belong to? These cement bags should not be wasted, and furthermore shouldn’t occupy the wharf for such a long time!　Ge Xianhua

  五颜六色的河水在苏州市人们出阊门走上渡僧桥，会常看到山塘河里的水时红、时绿，变化多端。
    这种五颜六色的河水，不是自然界原来就有的，而是苏州市第二炼染社制造的。这个社对染过“下脚染水”一向不加利用，每天总要倒掉含有不少染料的所谓“下脚水”。这些下脚水就把河染成五颜六色。
    这种浪费现象，不但使社里一年要损失约二千元，并且影响了附近居民的生活。每当居民洗衣淘米的时候，遇到倒出的颜料水，就会把洗的衣服和米都染上了颜色，希望这个社迅速纠正这种做法。

    没人管的水泥
    在佛子岭水库上游卷阳道码头上，放着四十包（两吨）水泥没有人管。八个多月来，经过风吹雨打，大部分已经结块失效，变成废物了。
    这批水泥究竟是哪个单位的呢？总不能让这些水泥全部浪费掉，并且长期占着码头呀！　葛先华
