　　Praised throughout London
　　A Chinese girl sits, head bowed, embroidering. Many foreign spectators surround her, intently watching the girl's hands. This is a photograph hanging in the Suzhou Embroidery Arts and Crafts Production Cooperative.
　　This photograph was taken in London, England.
　　Last September, London held an "International Exhibition of Handicrafts and Home Hobbies." The British people, hearing that there was a girl from Beijing in the Chinese pavilion demonstrating embroidery, were eager not to miss this good opportunity to understand New China.
　　Every day, even before the demonstration time, the crowd densely surrounded the demonstration platform. The Chinese girl's threading of a needle and splitting of a thread aroused people's interest. She was embroidering a cat and butterfly screen, with two kittens looking up, chasing butterflies under rose bushes. When embroidering the cat's whiskers, a thread was split into twelve strands. Someone exclaimed, "I can't believe my eyes!" A British woman who loved embroidery insisted on asking the Chinese girl to teach her how to split threads and embroider flower centers. The Chinese girl enthusiastically taught her for half a day. The woman said, "Chinese embroidery is so exquisite; I can't even hold the needle steady." A teacher from an embroidery school specifically traveled from Scotland to London. She watched for a long time in front of the demonstration platform, reluctant to leave. In the Chinese girl's embroidery bag, she saw a heart-shaped embroidered needle case and admired it repeatedly. The Chinese girl said, "I'll give it to you!" The teacher was extremely excited, tightly grasping the Chinese girl's hand and saying, "I'll take it back to show my students and preserve it forever." Many people who could not go to the exhibition hall watched the Chinese girl demonstrate embroidery on television. The suggestion book in the Chinese pavilion was filled with words of praise and gratitude. Some said, "The embroidered cats are so lifelike; I can almost hear them meowing." An engineer named Crump said, "Manufacturing these things is much better than manufacturing atomic bombs."
　　This embroidery girl, praised throughout London, is named Gu Wenxia.

　　Happy Labor
　　On the eve of International Women's Day, I visited Gu Wenxia at the Suzhou Embroidery Arts and Crafts Production Cooperative.
　　She is twenty-six years old this year, with bright, sparkling eyes under long eyelashes. She was still embroidering a cat and butterfly screen. I asked her why she didn't change to a new design. She said, "This cat and butterfly screen is different from the one I embroidered in London. This is double-sided embroidery, with the front and back sides embroidered exactly the same." I, like the British audience, almost couldn't believe my eyes. I sat next to her and watched for a long time, and had to admire her skillful hands. On the embroidered cat, she lightly applied a layer of soft fur using the sparse needle method. This layer of soft fur seemed as if it could float away with a breath, and there was no difference between the front and back.
　　Chinese women have been skilled in embroidery since ancient times. As early as the Song Dynasty, Suzhou embroidery had already begun to develop its unique style. Now, there are more than 50,000 women engaged in embroidery in the Suzhou area. Gu Wenxia's embroidery skills have also been passed down through generations. Her mother started learning embroidery at the age of fourteen and is now fifty-seven years old. She and her daughter work in the same cooperative.
　　At Gu Wenxia's home, the mother and daughter talked to me about the past.
　　Gu Wenxia's father died when she was two years old. Her mother relied on her own labor to raise a daughter and a son. In the past, girls from wealthy families would start having people embroider their wedding dresses when they were only teenagers. Girls from poor families could only be like the ancient poem says: "Pitiable, year after year pressing golden thread, making wedding clothes for others." When Gu Wenxia was sixteen years old, unable to bear letting her mother shoulder the burden of the family alone, she tearfully left school and picked up the embroidery needle. One beautiful flower after another was embroidered, but the embroidery girl did not begin to enjoy happy labor until after Liberation.
　　In 1955, Gu Wenxia and a group of embroidery artists organized their own cooperative. The cooperative hired instructors to help them study and improve their skills. Art professors and painters provided them with drafts and often came to the cooperative to provide artistic guidance. They also frequently held lectures on color theory and traditional Chinese painting. Gu Wenxia constantly absorbed new things and humbly learned from experienced artisans. Her embroidery skills improved rapidly. The products of their cooperative received praise from foreigners when they were exhibited in Leipzig, Damascus, and other places.

　　The Peak of Art Has No Limit
　　After returning from London, Gu Wenxia's desire to further improve her skills became even more urgent. She joined the double-sided embroidery group and often learned from double-sided embroidery expert Li Eying and other experienced artisans.
　　On Sunday, the cooperative was closed. Gu Wenxia invited Jin Jingfen, the director of the cooperative, to visit the Humble Administrator's Garden, and also invited me to go along. Jin Jingfen is a seventy-three-year-old artisan who has embroidered countless flowers, plants, and trees for over fifty years. Along the way, Gu Wenxia asked the old lady about unfamiliar flowers and trees, and always received a satisfactory answer.
　　We stopped by the pool where pairs of mandarin ducks were swimming. The two generations of embroidery experts intently watched the various postures of the mandarin ducks playing in the water and their beautiful feathers, happily discussing what needlework to use for embroidering the head and neck and what colors to use for embroidering the feathers. They loved their craft so much.
　　In the cultural relics exhibition room in the Humble Administrator's Garden, two portraits of Western figures embroidered by old artisans from Nantong decades ago aroused their great interest. Gu Wenxia carefully watched the sheer gauze wrapped around the woman's body in the embroidery, pondering what needlework could be used to embroider it so lightly, and also embroider the voluptuous flesh inside the gauze. She said with envy, "This is true art! The peak of art has no limit."

    绣花姑娘
    新华社记者　古平
    誉满伦敦城
    一个中国姑娘坐着低头绣花。很多外国观众围在旁边聚精会神地注视着这位姑娘的手。这是挂在苏州市刺绣工艺美术生产合作社的一张照片。
    这张照片是在英国伦敦照的。
    去年9月，伦敦举行了一个“手工艺术品及家庭爱好品国际展览会”，英国人听说中国馆里有个从北京来的姑娘表演刺绣，都不想放弃这个了解新中国的好机会。
    每天，还没有到表演时间，人群就密密层层地把表演台包围起来了。中国姑娘穿一次针，劈一根线，都引起人们的兴趣。她绣的是一幅猫蝶挂屏，两只小花猫仰着头追寻蔷薇花下的蝴蝶。在绣猫的胡须时，一根花线被劈成了十二股，有人惊讶地说：“我不敢相信我的眼睛了！”一位爱好刺绣的英国妇女一定要请中国姑娘教她劈线和绣花心的方法，中国姑娘热情地教了她半天，她说：“中国刺绣实在太精细了，我连拿针都拿不牢。”一位刺绣学校的教师特地从苏格兰赶到伦敦，她在表演台前看了很久，转来转去一直不愿离开。在中国姑娘的绣花包里，她看到一只鸡心形的绣花插针包，就爱不释手地翻来复去地欣赏。中国姑娘说：“送给你吧！”这位教师兴奋极了，紧握着中国姑娘的手说：“我要带回去给我的学生看，要永运保存它。”许多不能到展览馆去的人，就在电视机旁看中国姑娘表演刺绣。中国馆的意见簿上，写满了赞美和感谢的话。有的说：“刺绣的猫这样逼真，我几乎可以听到它们在叫。”一位名叫克郎普的工程师说：“制造这些东西要比制造原子弹好得多。”
    这位誉满伦敦的绣花姑娘名叫顾文霞。
    幸福的劳动
    三八节前夕，我在苏州市刺绣工艺美术生产合作社访问了顾文霞。
    她今年二十六岁，长睫毛下一双大眼睛乌溜溜地闪着亮光。她还是在绣一幅猫蝶屏。我问她为什么不换个新花样，她说：“这幅猫蝶屏和在伦敦绣的那幅不同，这是双面绣，正反两面绣得完全一样。”我也和英国观众一样，几乎要不相信自己的眼睛了。坐在旁边看了半天，不得不佩服她那双巧手。在绣好了的猫身上，再用稀针法轻轻地缀上一层软毛，这层松软的毛好像吹一口气就能飘动起来，而且反面和正面没有一点分别。
    中国妇女自古以来就擅长刺绣。远在宋代，苏绣已开始具有它独特的风格。现在，苏州一带从事刺绣的妇女在五万人以上。顾文霞从事刺绣也是世代相传的，她母亲十四岁就开始学刺绣，今年五十七岁，她和女儿同在一个合作社里。
    在顾文霞家里，母女俩和我谈起了往事。
    顾文霞两岁时父亲就死去了。母亲靠双手劳动抚养一个女儿和一个儿子。过去有钱人家姑娘才十几岁，就开始请人绣嫁衣。穷人家的姑娘只好像古诗所说：“可怜年年压金线，为他人作嫁衣裳。”顾文霞十六岁那年，不忍让妈妈一个人挑着家庭的重担，眼泪汪汪地离开学校，拿起了绣花针。美丽的花朵绣了一枝又一枝，可是绣花姑娘直到解放后才开始了幸福的劳动。
    1955年，顾文霞和一批刺绣艺人一起组织了自己的合作社，社里请了指导员帮助她们研究提高技术。美术教授和画家们供给她们画稿，经常到社里去进行艺术指导，还常常举行色彩学讲座和国画讲座。顾文霞不断地吸收新的东西，虚心地向老艺人学习，刺绣技术提高得很快。她们合作社的产品在来比锡、大马士革等地方展览时都得到国外人士的赞扬。
    艺术的高峰没有止境
    顾文霞从伦敦回国后，要求进一步提高技术的愿望更加迫切了。她参加了双面绣小组，经常向双面绣能手李娥瑛及其他有经验的老艺人学习。
    星期日，合作社里休假，顾文霞约了社里的主任金静芬去游拙政园，也邀我同去。金静芬是个七十三岁的老艺人，五十多年来，她数不清地绣过了多少花草树木。顾文霞一路上见到不知名的花和树，就请问这位老太太，总能得到满意的答复。
    我们停步在游着一对对鸳鸯的水池边，两代刺绣能手出神地注视鸳鸯嬉水的各种姿态和它们身上美丽的羽毛，高兴地研究着绣头颈该用什么针法，绣羽毛该用什么颜色。她们是这样爱好她们的事业。
    在拙政园里的文物展览室里，南通老艺人在几十年前绣的两幅西洋人物像，引起了她们很大的兴趣。顾文霞仔细地观看绣品中裹在女人身上的一袭薄纱，揣摩着是用什么针法才能绣得这样轻盈，而且绣出了薄纱里面丰腴的肉体。她用羡慕的口吻说：“这是真正的艺术品啊！艺术的高峰是没有止境的。绣花姑娘顾文霞　（新观察杂志社稿）
