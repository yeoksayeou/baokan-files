Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, March 21st: Agricultural cooperatives in Wushan County, Sichuan Province, are universally carrying out activities to mutually adjust seeds, draught cattle, and manpower between high and low mountain areas.

Wushan County is mountainous, divided into high, medium, and low mountain areas. Because the altitude varies greatly, the crops grown and their ripening seasons differ in each area. At the same time, the high mountain areas have a wide area of cultivated land, with fewer people and more cattle, while the low mountain areas have a small area of cultivated land, with more people and fewer cattle. Therefore, farmers in high and low mountain areas have had the habit of mutual assistance among relatives and friends in the past.

This year, in order to inherit this traditional habit of mutual assistance and strive for a bumper harvest, the rural organizations of the Wushan County Committee of the Communist Party of China called on agricultural cooperatives to help each other, open up old relationships, negotiate reasonable prices, and adjust seeds, draught cattle, and manpower through contracts or verbal agreements.

From February to mid-March, more than 950 low and medium mountain cooperatives and more than 210 high mountain cooperatives throughout the county universally launched adjustment activities between cooperatives and teams. High mountain cooperatives supported low mountain cooperatives with a large number of potato seeds and many draught cattle, and low mountain cooperatives also transferred sweet potato vines (for planting) and manpower needed by high mountain cooperatives. There was frequent traffic between the mountains, overcoming the current production difficulties. Huanglong First Agricultural Cooperative in the low mountain area and Longdong and Meidian cooperatives in the high mountain area signed a mutual assistance contract, adjusting nearly 2,000 jin of potato seeds and 170,000 sweet potato vines, solving each other's seed shortage difficulties. Now the sowing of potatoes in the low and medium mountain cooperatives throughout the county is nearing completion, and the amount of seeds used has increased by about 20% compared with last year. In the past few days, the snow on the high mountains has melted, the land has thawed, and the people of the low mountain cooperatives have been helping the high mountain cooperatives to plow the land in groups.

### 取长补短、相互支援　巫山县高山和低山地区开展互助活动

　　取长补短、相互支援
　　巫山县高山和低山地区开展互助活动
    新华社成都21日电　四川省巫山县各农业社普遍开展高山和低山地区互相调剂种籽、耕牛和人力的活动。
    巫山县是山地，分为高山、中山、低山等三种地区，因为海拔高度相差很大，各地区生长的作物和作物的成熟季节都不相同。同时高山上耕地面积广，人少牛多；低山上耕地面积小，人多牛少。因此过去高山和低山地区的农民都有亲友互助的习惯。
    今年，为继承这一传统互助习惯，争取农业丰收，中共巫山县各农村组织号召各农业社互相帮助，打通旧有关系，商定合理价格，通过订合同或口头相约，调剂种籽、耕牛和人力。
    从2月到3月中旬，全县九百五十多个低山、中山社和二百一十多个高山社，都普遍展开社与社、队与队的调剂活动。高山社支援低山社大批洋芋种和许多耕牛，低山社也调去高山社需要的甘薯藤子（作种用）和人力。山上山下，往来频繁，克服了当前生产的困难。低山社黄龙第一农业社和高山上龙洞、么店两个社订立互助合同，调剂了近二千斤洋芋种和十七万根甘薯藤子，彼此缺种困难都解决了。现在全县低山、中山社播种洋芋已近结束，用种量约比去年增加二成。这几天，高山上雪已融化，土地解冻，低山社的人们又成群结队的帮助高山社翻耘土地。
