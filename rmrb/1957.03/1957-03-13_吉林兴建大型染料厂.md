The auxiliary projects of China's first comprehensive large-scale dye factory—the Jilin Dye Factory—have been largely completed, and the main factory buildings are currently under intense construction.

The Jilin Dye Factory is designed with the help of the Soviet Union according to the most advanced technical standards. There are twenty-two production workshops alone. Most of the production processes in this factory are automated, fundamentally solving the problem of poisoning among production workers.

After the factory is completed, it will make extensive use of by-products from the steel industry's coking process to produce high-grade dyes such as indanthrene, labor-farmer blue, and anan blue, which are most familiar and loved by the Chinese people. In the past, these dyes mainly relied on imports.

    吉林兴建大型染料厂
    本报讯　我国第一座综合性的大型染料厂——吉林染料厂辅助工程已大部完成，主厂房目前正紧张施工。
    吉林染料厂是苏联按照最先进的技术水平帮助我国设计的，仅生产车间就有二十二个。这个厂绝大部分生产过程都是自动化，根本解决了生产工人的中毒问题。
    这个厂建成后，将大量利用钢铁工业炼焦的副产品，生产我国人民一向最熟悉、最喜爱的阴丹士林、工农蓝、安安蓝等高级染料。这些染料在过去主要是靠进口。
