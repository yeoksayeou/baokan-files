    The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee Jointly Issue Instructions
　　Do a Good Job in Mobilizing Township Cadres to Return to Production Posts
    (Our Dispatch) The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee recently issued a joint directive, requiring the correct handling of the issue of township cadres returning to production posts.
    In the recent period, Jiangxi Province has transferred a group of leading cadres from leading organs above the county level to strengthen the grassroots, and at the same time, mobilized a portion of township cadres to return to production posts to strengthen leadership at the grassroots level. In many places, relatively thorough ideological and organizational work was carried out when cadres were sent down, so most of the sent-down cadres have stable minds and are working well. However, in some places, ideological and organizational work was not done sufficiently, leading to emotional fluctuations among some township and commune cadres, and some who have already returned to production posts are not very satisfied, affecting work and production.
    In view of the above situation, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee require that, when dealing with the issue of sending cadres down, not only should the issue of saving expenses be considered, but more importantly, the issue of strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses, improving work style, and improving work efficiency should be considered. The directive requires that all cadres sent down to the townships should have a good work style, be healthy, have a certain working ability and agricultural production knowledge, and have close ties with the local masses. The directive also made provisions for the establishment, positions and other issues of cadres after they arrive in the townships. At the same time, it pointed out that the number of cadres sent down to the townships should not be too large, so as to avoid excessive replacement of the original cadres. Township cadres who are more capable and have higher prestige among the masses should continue to hold their original jobs. For township cadres who are prepared to be mobilized to return to production posts, sufficient ideological education work must be carried out to truly open up their minds and make them consciously and voluntarily participate, and resolutely prevent hasty actions and coercive orders. The township's party and government organizations should make a correct work appraisal of the cadres who return to production posts, issue certificates, and appropriately take care of their living difficulties. At the same time, the broad masses and family members of cadres should also be educated to realize the great significance of township cadres returning to production posts to participate in and lead production, and warmly welcome and respect the cadres returning to their hometowns. The directive also pointed out that, in order to carry out this work more steadily and soundly, a transitional method can be adopted for a certain period, that is, in addition to the three to five main cadres who are completely detached from production in each township, the rest can use the method of "one person's meal for two people," and use more township cadres who are partially detached from production, and then gradually change this method. The directive requires all localities to give special care to cadres who have already returned to production posts. Party committees and governments at all levels should regularly understand their participation in production and leadership of production, strengthen their contact with them, and regularly conduct ideological education on them, so that they not only strive to do a good job in their own production, but also modelly abide by government laws and use their actions to influence and drive the masses to jointly complete this year's production plan. Those who have achieved success in production and work should be praised and encouraged. For those cadres who are emotionally disturbed because the mobilization and persuasion work is insufficient, they should be patiently persuaded and educated to make them settle down and do a good job in production. If individual cadres resolutely refuse to return to production posts, they can also be temporarily transferred back to take up semi-detached production work.

    中共江西省委和省人民委员会联合指示
　　做好动员乡干部返回生产岗位的工作
    本报讯  中共江西省委和省人民委员会最近发出联合指示，要求正确处理乡干部回到生产岗位的问题。
    最近一个时期，江西省已从县以上领导机关中，抽调了一批领导骨干充实基层，同时动员了一部分乡干部回到生产岗位，以加强对基层的领导。许多地方在下放干部时，进行了比较充分的思想工作和组织工作，因而大部分下放的干部思想稳定，工作情况较好。但是，也有一些地方，思想工作和组织工作作得不够充分，以致有些乡社干部情绪波动，有些已经回到生产岗位的也不大满意，使工作和生产受到影响。
    鉴于以上情况，中共江西省委和省人民委员会要求，在处理干部下放问题时，不仅要考虑到节省开支问题，更重要的要考虑密切干群关系，改进工作作风和提高工作效率。指示要求，所有下放到乡的干部，都应该是作风好、身体健康，有一定工作能力和农业生产知识，并且和当地群众有密切联系的。指示并且对干部到乡后的编制、职务等问题作了规定。同时指出，下放到乡的干部数量不宜太多，以免过多的调换原来的干部。能力较强在群众中威信较高的乡干部，应当继续担任原来的工作。对于准备动员返回生产岗位的乡干部，必须进行充分的思想教育工作，做到真正打通思想自觉自愿，坚决防止草率从事和强迫命令的作法。乡的党、政组织对回到生产岗位的干部要做出正确的工作鉴定，发给证明文件，适当的照顾他们的生活困难。同时，还应该教育广大群众和干部家属，使他们认识到乡干部回到生产岗位参加和领导生产的重大意义，热情地欢迎和尊重回乡干部。指示还指出，为了把这一工作进行得更稳妥健全，在一定时期内，还可以采取一种过渡办法，即每乡除三至五个完全脱离生产的主要干部以外，其余可用“一个人的饭两个人吃”的办法，多使用一部分半脱离生产的乡干部，以后，再逐步改变这种办法。对于已经回到生产岗位的干部，指示要求各地要特别给予关怀。各级党委和政府应当经常了解他们参加生产和领导生产的情况，加强和他们的联系，经常对他们进行思想教育，使他们不但努力搞好自己的生产，而且模范地遵守政府法令，用自己的行动影响和带动群众，共同完成今年的生产计划。对于生产和工作有成绩的，应当给予表扬和鼓励。对于那些因为动员说服工作不够而情绪不安的干部，应该耐心地进行说服教育，使他们安下心来搞好生产。个别干部如果坚决不愿返回生产岗位，也可以暂时调回来改任半脱离生产的工作。
