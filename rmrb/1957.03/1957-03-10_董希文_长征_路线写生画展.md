    Dong Xiwen's "Long March" Route Sketch Exhibition
    Ai Zhongxin

    Two years ago, the painter Dong Xiwen spent more than half a year along the route of the Red Army's Long March collecting materials for the creation of revolutionary history paintings. He personally experienced hardships and made many sketches. The more than one hundred works now exhibited in the Central Academy of Fine Arts Auditorium, although not all-inclusive, already show the rich results of this extraordinary travel sketching.

    In these works, most of the paintings depict historical events of the Red Army's Long March. Among them are realistic and powerful depictions of the conference hall and the corridor outside the hall of the Zunyi Conference, Lou Mountain Pass, Dadu River, Mao'ergai, Lazikou, and the grasslands, all of which were conquered by the Red Army with mythical perseverance. In addition to these, he also painted many scenes of the lives of the people along the route, especially the Tibetan people, and the local scenery. Wherever the Red Army's footsteps reached, every mountain and every river has great political significance, evoking heartfelt respect for the revolutionary pioneers! We can fully imagine how these rivers and mountains inspired the painter's emotions, making him realize that the work he was engaged in was by no means comparable to ordinary sketching, thereby strengthening the ideological factors of this work. The main reason why the scenery on the Long March line is so universally loved by the broad masses of people lies here.

    However, there is another reason why people love these pictures, and that is the artistic power of the pictures. He has put his heart into dealing with painting problems, the artistic language he adopted, and how to express emotions. In my opinion, his oil paintings are indeed realistic and expressive in terms of modeling and color. In particular, the sophistication of the modeling—being realistic, and accurate is a great advantage. Confucius said: "To know when you know, and to know when you do not know, that is true knowledge." The same attitude should be taken toward modeling. Chinese painting theory emphasizes that the eye and the hand must work together. In his works, there is no arbitrary use of the brush; what is expressed is what he has recognized. Because he has a considerable depth of understanding of objective things, he can be sophisticated. In other words, the images we see in these pictures are clear, have roots and are based on facts, without misstrokes and few blemishes. This should be mainly attributed to his sketch skills, which fundamentally constitute a solid foundation for his artistic cultivation. His painting language is not poor. On the contrary, it is very diverse and creative. Clarity does not hinder novelty, which is especially evident in his handling of figures, costumes, and complex objects such as mass scenes and natural landscapes. The Mao'ergai grand meeting and the portraits of Tibetan women are good examples.

    His paintings are even more distinctive in color. The use of color is also clear, accurate, and in harmony with the clarity of the modeling. He does not adopt subtle changes and contrasts in color, but adopts strong, large-scale color contrast effects. He does not adopt the spatial color perception that exists in nature, but adopts a more exaggerated sense of decorative color. From the perspective of traditional oil painting, sometimes it feels like it lacks luster and spatial atmosphere, but its advantage is that it is bright and powerful, and can arouse high emotions. Undoubtedly, this is the result of a conscious pursuit of national style. The Chinese style of oil painting, like other issues, will require various aspects of experimentation and exploration for a considerable period of time in terms of color. Dong Xiwen's road is not the only one, but it has already proven to be effective.

    The significance of the Central Academy of Fine Arts holding this exhibition is to introduce some new achievements made by the painter Dong Xiwen in artistic creation in recent years. It is hoped that people from all walks of life and the broad masses of the people will care about our art.

    董希文“长征”路线写生画展
    艾中信
    前年，画家董希文用半年多的时间，沿着红军长征的路线，收集革命史画的创作素材。他亲历艰险，作了不少写生。现在在中央美术学院礼堂所展出的一百多幅作品，虽然还没有包括全部，但已可以由此看到他这次不平凡的旅行写生所获得的丰富成果。
    在这些作品中，画的多数是红军长征的历史事迹。其中如遵义会议的会议厅和厅外的长廊、娄山关、大渡河、毛儿盖、腊子口以及草地等等被红军以神话般的毅力所战胜了的天险，画家都作了确实而有力的描绘。除此而外，他还画了很多沿线人民特别是藏族人民的生活和当地的风景。红军当年足迹所至，一个山头，一条河流，都具有重大的政治意义，触景生情，令人能不兴起对革命先驱的衷心崇敬！我们完全可以想像到，这些河山景物，怎样激发了画家的情感，使他意识到他所从事的工作，绝非等闲的写生可比，从而加强了他这一工作的思想因素。而长征线上的景物，其所以特别受到广大人民的普遍喜爱，主要原因也就在这里。
    但是，人们所以喜爱这些图画，还有另外的原因，那就是图画的艺术力量。他在处理绘画性的问题上，所采取的艺术语言以及怎样表达情感这方面是有所用心的。在我看来，他的油画，在造型上和色彩上都确实而有表现力，特别是造型的老到——实事求是、确切无移，是一个很大的优点。孔子说：“知之为知之，不知为不知，是知也。”对于造型，也应抱这样的态度。中国画论很强调眼到手到，在他的作品上，看不到任意为之的用笔，所表达的，都是他所认识到的；因他对客观事物的了解有相当的深度，所以能够老到。换句话说：在这些图画中，我们看到的形象，清楚明白，有根有据，没有误笔，很少败笔，这一点应主要归功于他的素描功夫，这就在根本上构成了他的艺术修养的巩固基础。他的绘画语言，并不贫乏，相反，它很多样，而且富于创造性。清楚明白并不妨碍新颖出奇，这在他处理人物、服饰以及复杂事物如群众场面和自然景物时，特别可以明显地看出来。如毛儿盖盛会和藏族妇女的肖像就是很好说明的例子。
    他的绘画，在色彩上更具鲜明的特色。运用色彩，同样清楚明白、确切不移，和造型的明确相融洽。他不采取色彩的细微变化和对比作用，而采取强烈的大块的色彩对比效果，不采取按照自然界所呈现的那样存在于空间的色彩感应，而采取比较夸张了的色彩的装饰感；从传统的油画的角度来看，有时觉得缺少光泽感和空间气氛，但是它的优点是明亮而有力，能唤起高昂的情绪。无疑，这是有意识的追求民族风格的结果。油画的中国风，在色彩问题上，同其他问题一样，在相当长的时期内，还需要种种方面的尝试、探索。董希文的道路不是唯一的，但已经可以证明是有效的。
    中央美术学院举办这个展览会的意义，是介绍近年来画家董希文在美术创作上的一些新的收获。希望社会人士和广大人民群众关心我们的美术事业。
