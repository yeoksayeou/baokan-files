Xinhua News Agency, March 10th: Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai said at a banquet tonight welcoming the Czechoslovak Republic Government Delegation headed by Viliam Široký: This visit to our country by the Czechoslovak Republic Government Delegation will undoubtedly further strengthen the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries and strengthen the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

Premier Zhou Enlai said: As a member of the socialist family, Czechoslovakia has always been faithful to the principles of proletarian internationalism and has strived to continuously consolidate the unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. Like the people of Czechoslovakia, the Chinese people firmly believe that the unity of socialist countries is the most reliable guarantee for maintaining peace and the cause of human progress.

Premier Zhou said: The people of China and Czechoslovakia have always had a deep, brotherly friendship. The Chinese government and people express their heartfelt thanks to the Czechoslovak government and people for their sincere assistance to us. The Chinese people are very pleased to see that under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the people of Czechoslovakia have made great achievements in all aspects after twelve years of socialist construction.

Premier Viliam Široký then spoke at the banquet, saying: It is of inestimable historical significance for our country to have such loyal and sincere friends as the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Premier Široký said: The establishment of the People's Republic of China and its establishment of a solid fraternal alliance with the Soviet Union have changed the face of the world and the balance of world power. One-quarter of humanity has firmly embarked on the road of socialism, and every day is providing new facts to prove the truth, correctness, and great power of the great Marxist-Leninist ideology.

Premier Široký said: The Chinese people are unprecedentedly united around their government, which is reliably and wisely leading them towards a better new life. The Communist Party of China brilliantly combines its rich revolutionary experience, its loyalty to Marxist-Leninist thought and principles, with the wisdom, simplicity, humility, tireless perseverance, and diligence of the Chinese people; it combines the rich cultural traditions of thousands of years with the enthusiasm of the socialist revolution; it combines the thorough and resolute loyalty to the principles of proletarian internationalism with the interests of the Chinese working people. This policy and the efforts made by the Chinese people to implement this policy are a great and valuable contribution to the entire socialist camp, to the international workers' movement, and to the socialist, peaceful, and free cause of the people of the world.

After the speeches by Premier Zhou and Premier Široký (full text on page 5), the guests jointly toasted to the friendship between China and Czechoslovakia, to the further prosperity of the two countries and the happiness of the people, and to the further development of the unity and strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
