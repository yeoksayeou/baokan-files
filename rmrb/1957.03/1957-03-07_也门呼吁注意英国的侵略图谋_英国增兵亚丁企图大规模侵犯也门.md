Xinhua News Agency, March 6th, London Dispatch: The Yemeni Embassy in the United Kingdom issued a statement on the 5th, calling on world public opinion to pay attention to the seriousness of Britain's aggressive intentions on the Yemeni border.

The statement said that British troops fired three hundred shells at the Yemeni border outpost of Souda in the Harib region on March 3rd. The statement said: British troops’ "aggressive actions with cannons, machine guns, and rifles continued throughout the day." The statement said that this action "is inconsistent with Yemen's efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement."

The statement warned Britain that Yemen will not hesitate to exercise its right to self-defense, no matter how serious the cost in terms of manpower, material resources, and financial resources.

Xinhua News Agency, March 6th, Beirut Dispatch from TASS on the 5th: News from Aden says that British weapons are being continuously transported to the port of Aden, including a large number of field guns and even heavy tanks. Recently, more and more British troops have been arriving in Aden, including British paratrooper units.

This military buildup indicates that British troops are preparing to launch a new, larger-scale invasion of Yemen than before. For three months, British troops have been invading Yemeni territory.

    也门呼吁注意英国的侵略图谋
    英国增兵亚丁企图大规模侵犯也门
    新华社6日讯　伦敦消息：也门驻英国公使馆5日发表声明，呼吁世界舆论注意英国对也门边境的侵略意图的严重性。
    声明说，英国军队3月3日对也门哈里布地区的边沿阵地苏达发放了三百发炮弹。声明说：英国军队“用大炮、机关枪和步枪进行的侵略行动继续了一整天”。声明说，这种行动“同也门争取达成停火协议的努力是不相称的”。
    声明警告英国说，也门将毫不迟疑地行使它的自卫权利，不论这在人力、物力和财力方面的耗费会有多么严重。
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社贝鲁特5日讯：来自亚丁的消息说，英国武器正源源运往亚丁港，其中包括大量的野炮，甚至重型坦克。近来，愈来愈多的英军开到亚丁，其中有英国的伞兵部队。
    这种军事集结表明，英军准备重新对也门发动一次规模比从前更大的侵犯。三个月来英国军队一直在侵犯也门领土。
