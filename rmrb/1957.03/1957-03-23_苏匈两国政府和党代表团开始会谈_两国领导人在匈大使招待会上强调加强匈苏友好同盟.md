Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd, Moscow dispatch: According to TASS, the Soviet government and Communist Party delegation began talks with the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government and the Socialist Workers' Party delegation on March 21st in the Kremlin.

At the beginning of the talks, the head of the Hungarian delegation, Kádár, spoke. On behalf of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, the Socialist Workers' Party, and the Hungarian people, he expressed deep gratitude to the Soviet government, the Communist Party, and the Soviet people for their sincere and fraternal support to the Hungarian People's Republic.

Subsequently, both sides exchanged views on political and economic issues of great significance to the brotherly relations between the Soviet Union and Hungary, as well as issues related to the development of the current international situation.

On all the issues discussed, the two sides were in agreement and reached mutual understanding. Both sides decided to entrust experts from both sides to draft relevant proposals for discussion by the delegations.

Participating in this sincere and friendly meeting on the Soviet side were Bulganin, Voroshilov, Khrushchev, Mikoyan, Malenkov, Zhukov, Gromyko, Soviet Ambassador to Hungary Gromov, and others. On the Hungarian side were Kádár, Dobi, Apro, Horváth, Kállai, Kiss, Révész, Hungarian Ambassador to the Soviet Union Boldoczki, and others.

The talks will continue.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 22nd: Hungarian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Boldoczki, held a reception in Moscow on the evening of March 21st to entertain the Hungarian People's Republic Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party delegation visiting here.

The head of the delegation, Prime Minister Kádár of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, spoke at the reception. He said that the talks between the party and government delegations of Hungary and the Soviet Union would further consolidate and strengthen the friendly and allied relations between the two countries. If the Hungarian people can continue to strengthen the long-standing friendship with the Soviet Union, which leads the socialist countries' camp, they will be able to better defend their interests.

Kádár said that Hungary is a small country, while the Soviet Union is one of the world's major powers. We have personally experienced how deeply the delegation of the great Soviet Union's party and government respects the independence and sovereignty of the Hungarian People's Republic. We have experienced that the Soviet government develops its international relations in accordance with the principles of international relations formulated by Lenin, recognizing the Hungarian people as an equal partner.

Prime Minister Kádár said that Hungary's relations with the United States are not good. The government officials of the United States harbor hostility towards the Hungarian People's Republic and the Hungarian people. The imperialist bloc, headed by American imperialism, was the instigator, accomplice, and protector of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary last October. Therefore, no one should be surprised that the peace-loving and independent Hungarian people have drawn the conclusion from this experience that the only guarantee of their peace and independence is the unbreakable ties established with the socialist countries in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, and they have no intention of relaxing these ties in the slightest.

Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Bulganin, then spoke. He said that the international situation in recent months has powerfully demonstrated how important the unbreakable friendship and fraternal unity of the people of all socialist countries are. The international reactionaries' conspiracy to drag the Hungarian People's Republic out of the socialist countries' fraternal family was shattered when it encountered this unity, as if it had hit an unbreakable rock.

The Soviet people wholeheartedly welcome the Hungarian working people's victory over the dark forces of counter-revolution. The friendship between the Soviet and Hungarian people has stood the test of time and has been tempered even stronger in the course of recent events.

Bulganin said that our two peoples, united by the common ideal of socialism and loyal to the great ideas of proletarian internationalism, have repeatedly provided mutual assistance. The Hungarian working people can be confident that the Soviet Union will continue to provide the Hungarian people with assistance and support in the future.

The leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and government, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Malenkov, Mikoyan, Molotov, Pervukhin, Suslov, Khrushchev, Zhukov, Brezhnev, Shvernik, Aristov, and Belyaev, were invited to attend the reception. At the reception, they frequently toasted the victory of the Hungarian people in defending the people's democratic system and the further development of friendship between the two countries.

After the reception, Hungarian artists who are visiting Moscow gave a performance. (Attached picture)

    苏匈两国政府和党代表团开始会谈
　　两国领导人在匈大使招待会上强调加强匈苏友好同盟
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府和共产党的代表团同匈牙利工农革命政府和社会主义工人党的代表团21日在克里姆林宫开始举行会谈。
    会谈开始时，匈牙利代表团团长卡达尔讲了话。他代表匈牙利工农革命政府、社会主义工人党和匈牙利人民向苏联政府、共产党和苏联人民表示深深的感谢，感谢他们对匈牙利人民共和国的真诚的兄弟的支援。
    随后，双方就对苏联和匈牙利两国的兄弟关系具有重大意义的政治和经济问题，以及同目前国际局势的发展有关的问题交换了意见。
    在所有谈到的问题上，双方的意见是一致的，并且取得了相互的了解。双方决定委托双方专家草拟有关的建议，以供代表团讨论。
    参加这次真诚友好的会谈的，苏联方面有布尔加宁、伏罗希洛夫、赫鲁晓夫、米高扬、马林科夫、朱可夫、葛罗米柯、苏联驻匈牙利大使格罗莫夫等人；匈牙利方面有卡达尔、道比、奥普罗、霍瓦特、卡拉伊、基什、雷维斯、匈牙利驻苏联大使波尔多茨基等人。
    会谈将继续进行。
    新华社莫斯科22日电　匈牙利驻苏联大使波尔多茨基21日晚间在莫斯科举行招待会，招待正在这里访问的匈牙利人民共和国工农革命政府和匈牙利社会主义工人党代表团。
    代表团团长、匈牙利工农革命政府总理卡达尔在招待会上讲了话。他说，匈牙利和苏联两国党和政府代表团这次所进行的会谈将进一步巩固和加强匈苏两国的友好关系和同盟关系。如果匈牙利人民能继续加强同领导着社会主义国家阵营的苏联的历史悠久的友谊，他们就能更好地保卫自己的利益。
    卡达尔说，匈牙利是一个小国，而苏联是世界大国之一。我们亲身体会到，伟大苏联的党和政府的代表团是如何深切地尊重匈牙利人民共和国的独立和主权，我们体会到，苏联政府是按照列宁制定的国际关系原则来发展自己的国际关系的，它承认匈牙利人民是一个平等的伙伴。
    卡达尔总理说，匈牙利同美国的关系是不很好的。美国的政府人士对匈牙利人民共和国，对匈牙利人民怀着敌意。去年10月匈牙利反革命叛乱的煽动者、帮凶和庇护者，就是以美国帝国主义为首的帝国主义集团。因此，谁也不必奇怪，爱好和平和独立的匈牙利人民根据这次经验得出了这样一个结论：他们的和平和独立的唯一保证是本着无产阶级国际主义的精神同各社会主义国家建立的牢不可破的联系，而且他们丝毫不打算放松这种联系。
    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁接着讲话。他说，近几个月的国际情势有力地表明，社会主义各国人民牢不可破的友谊和兄弟般的团结是多么重要。企图把匈牙利人民共和国拖出社会主义国家兄弟家庭的国际反动派的阴谋在碰到这种团结的时候，就像碰到击不破的岩石上一样被粉碎了。
    苏联人民衷心地欢迎匈牙利劳动人民战胜反革命的黑暗势力。苏匈两国人民的友谊经过时间的考验，在最近一些事件的过程中锻炼得更加坚强了。
    布尔加宁说，为社会主义共同理想所团结的、忠于无产阶级国际主义伟大思想的我们两国人民曾不止一次地进行互助。匈牙利劳动人民可以深信，苏联今后仍将给予匈牙利人民以援助和支持。
    苏联共产党和政府的领导人伏罗希洛夫、卡冈诺维奇、马林科夫、米高扬、莫洛托夫、别尔乌辛、苏斯洛夫、赫鲁晓夫、朱可夫、勃列日涅夫、什维尔尼克、阿里斯托夫、别利亚耶夫应邀出席了招待会。在招待会上，他们同匈牙利政府和党的领导人频频为匈牙利人民保卫人民民主制度的胜利和两国友谊的进一步发展而干杯。
