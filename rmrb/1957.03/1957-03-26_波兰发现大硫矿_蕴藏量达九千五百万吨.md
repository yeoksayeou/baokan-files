Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 25th. According to a report by the Polish Press Agency, Polish geologists have discovered and explored sulfur deposits in the provinces of Cheshov and Kielce in the southeast, with an estimated total reserve of 95 million tons of pure sulfur. This makes Poland one of the countries with the largest sulfur reserves in the world.

Currently, relevant Polish authorities are conducting surveys on an area of approximately 6,000 hectares in Cheshov Province for the site of a future sulfur joint enterprise. It is estimated that this joint enterprise, once completed, will produce 350,000 tons of sulfur annually, with a future increase to 600,000 tons per year.

The architectural blueprints and cost estimates for this Tarnobrzeg joint enterprise, named after its production site, have been developed by Soviet experts in cooperation with Polish engineers, according to an agreement between Poland and the Soviet Union.

In Kielce Province, pilot mining operations are underway in Piaseczno.

Next year, it is planned to mine 55,000 tons of sulfur ore (approximately 10,000 tons of pure sulfur) nationwide in Poland. From 1959 to 1960, the annual production will be 60,000 tons of pure sulfur. By 1970, four sulfur mines will be built, producing 1 million tons of pure sulfur annually.

　  波兰发现大硫矿
    蕴藏量达九千五百万吨
    新华社华沙25日电　据波兰通讯社报道，波兰地质学家在东南部的彻索夫省和基尔兹省等地发现和勘探到的硫矿，估计共有九千五百万吨的纯硫储量。这样，波兰就成为世界上硫矿藏量最多的国家之一。
    现在波兰有关方面已经在彻索夫省面积约达六千公顷的地面上为未来的硫黄联合企业的厂址进行勘查。估计这个联合企业建成后每年可以生产硫黄三十五万吨，将来还要增加到年产六十万吨。
    这个以产地命名的塔诺布惹格联合企业的建筑蓝图和费用概算，已经根据波兰和苏联之间的一项协定，由苏联专家在波兰工程师的合作下制订出来。
    在基尔兹省，试验性的开采工作正在皮亚塞奇诺进行。
    明年计划在波兰全国开采五万五千吨硫黄矿石（约一万吨纯硫黄）。从1959年到1960年，每年将生产六万吨纯硫黄。到1970年将要建成四个硫黄矿，每年生产纯硫黄达一百万吨。
