Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 24th. A Soviet meritorious scientist predicted the living conditions of people fifty years from now, saying that by that time, people can rely on the development of biochemistry to obtain a large amount of small, high-calorie food. Even in old age, people will still be healthy and full of energy. With the help of electronic instruments and the like, the human eye can see things clearly in short-wavelength ultraviolet radiation. He will also be able to hear the sounds of nerve movement processes. The human olfactory organs can also rely on new technologies to smell gases from a distance. These predictions by Soviet meritorious scientist Frolov were made in response to questions from a "Moscow Komsomolets" reporter. This prediction is based on the possible development of science and technology in the future.

Frolov pointed out that in terms of food, the development of biochemistry will be able to "synthesize" carbohydrates and even proteins, so that a large number of new foods can be produced. At that time, people will often eat fruits and vegetables to preserve the extremely valuable secretion and motor functions of human organs. At the same time, people will use "heavy water" (a compound of deuterium and oxygen) as a beverage, which can inhibit the dissimilation and decomposition processes in the human body. The development of people in the twenty-first century will greatly exceed that of ordinary people today.

Frolov also said that with the help of electronic instruments and other instruments, the range of human vision will be greatly expanded at that time. Through electronic instruments, people's eyes will not only be able to see things in the dark and in infrared radiation, but also be able to see things clearly in extremely short-wavelength ultraviolet radiation. People can learn to see the internal structure of matter with their eyes, just like looking at things in X-ray photos now. In terms of hearing, people in the twenty-first century will be able to freely hear the sounds of things that cannot be seen now, such as the growth of grass, the flow of liquid in a cup, and the healing of broken bones, by using electromagnetic methods to reduce the frequency of sound wave vibrations.

The human olfactory organs can also be strengthened with new technologies. After the discovery of the ultra-short wave properties of odors, people can use special machines to conduct odors from a distance.

### 五十年后的人类　发育健壮　老而不衰　视力扩大　听觉灵敏

　　五十年后的人类
　　发育健壮　老而不衰
　　视力扩大　听觉灵敏
    新华社莫斯科24日电　苏联一位功勋科学家预测五十年后人的生活状况说，到那个时候，人们可以依靠生物化学的发展而获得大量的体积小、热量高的食品。即使到了老年，人们还是健康和精神饱满的。在电子仪器等的帮助下，人的眼睛可以在波长短的紫外线照射中看清楚东西。他还能够听到神经运动过程的声音。人的嗅觉器官也可以依靠新技术嗅到远距离以外的气体。苏联功勋科学家弗罗洛夫的这些预测，是在回答“莫斯科共青团员报”记者的问题时说的。这种预测以科学技术在今后的可能发展为依据。
    弗罗洛夫指出，在食品方面，生物化学的发展将能够“人工合成”碳水化合物甚至蛋白质，这样就可以生产出大量的新食品来。那时，人们将经常吃水果和蔬菜来保存人体器官所具有的极有价值的分泌机能和运动机能。同时，人们将以“重水”（氘和氧的化合物）作为饮料，它能够抑制人们机体内的物质的异化和分解过程。二十一世纪的人的发育将会大大超过现今的普通人。
    弗罗洛夫还说，在电子仪器和其他仪器的帮助下，那时人的视力范围将大大扩大。通过电子仪器，人们的眼睛不仅可以在黑暗中和红外线照射中看见东西，而且还可以在波长极短的紫外线照射中看清事物。人们可以学会用眼睛看见物质的内部结构，就像现在在爱克斯光照片上看东西一样。在听觉方面，二十一世纪的人将能够利用电磁降低声波振荡频率的方法，自由地听到那些现在不能看到的东西的声音，如青草的生长、液体在杯子里的流动、伤骨的愈合等。
    人的嗅觉器官也可以用新技术来加强。气味的超短波性能发现后，人就可以利用特殊的机器从远方传导气味。
