A Buddhist Scripture and Eight Warriors
　　Huang Miaozi
This story happened twenty years ago, in Zhao Cheng, Shanxi.
　　The Japanese invading army occupied Zhao Cheng, and they noticed the ancient Guang Sheng Temple in Zhao Cheng, because there was a famous Buddhist Tripitaka in the temple, and they planned to steal this Buddhist scripture. The old monk of Guang Sheng Temple heard the news and quickly sent someone to report to our guerrillas around Zhao Cheng. After the decision of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, a team was dispatched that night to transport the Tripitaka away. They encountered the enemy halfway, and a fierce battle finally completed the task of protecting the scripture. However, eight heroic guerrilla fighters sacrificed heroically for this.
　　This Tripitaka, which was exchanged for the blood of eight warriors, was carefully preserved for several years, and finally arrived in Beijing, the cultural center, with the liberation of the whole country in April 1949. In September of the same year, the Beijing Library held an exhibition of this Tripitaka. I went to see it at that time, and like all the viewers, I was happy to see the high art of ancient Chinese woodblock printing from more than 800 years ago, and I was also moved by the preservation of this Tripitaka.
　　This Tripitaka was funded and carved over thirty years by Cui Fazhen, a Buddhist woman in the Jin Dynasty (approximately 1115-1234). There are more than 4,300 volumes extant, which signifies a part of the cultural thoughts of ancient East, and also signifies the labor cost of countless ancestors spent on it. In terms of the study of ancient cultural history, it is a batch of data that cannot be ignored. Therefore, when I saw this Tripitaka, I often thought of the great spirit of these eight warriors who sacrificed their lives to protect ancient culture!
　　In a casual conversation, I told this story, and also told the story of those cultural warriors who were buried in the remote Gobi Desert of Gansu, working hard to sort out and study the Buddha statue carvings in the Dunhuang Grottoes. At that time, a skeptical comrade asked: Why are these scriptures and clay sculptures of Bodhisattvas still popular after liberation? Then, a self-righteous comrade immediately believed that the repair of some temples and the preservation of these relics after liberation was only to "take care of some religious figures," and so on. I think the question raised by the first comrade can help us deeply understand this issue, while the opinion of the self-righteous comrade is wrong.
　　I think that eliminating superstition is approved by the majority of people in the new society. The fact that we spent the price to protect and preserve some Buddha statues and scriptures only shows our emphasis on the sorting out of ancient cultural and artistic heritage. In the past few decades, no one could take care of it in the dark. We now live in a brand-new society with the most progressive and scientific ideological weapon—Marxism-Leninism. These national cultural heritages will be greatly shining in the world culture because we "absorb its essence and discard its dross."
　　I also participated in a more acute debate. The reason was that someone mentioned that we have made outstanding achievements in the preservation and sorting out of cultural heritage in recent years, but there are also some individual cases that are heartbreaking. He (assuming he is A) cited the reports in the newspapers that Longquan County, Zhejiang Province, demolished the Twin Pagodas of Chongyin Temple in the Northern Song Dynasty and the Jinsha Temple Pagoda of the Five Dynasties, using these pagoda bricks to pave roads, and some places destroyed Buddhist and Taoist bronze statues for money, and demolished ancient tomb bricks to repair wells, etc. Then someone (assuming he is B) came out to defend it, and the question and answer are as follows:
　　B: It’s no wonder, individual cadres don’t have a high level of culture, who knows what is essence and
　　what is dross!
　　A: Even so, isn't the state's law on the protection of cultural relics repeatedly emphasized? Doesn't
　　the higher level have orders to protect these cultural relics? Isn't obeying the law and the instructions of the higher level a
　　basic condition for a cadre?
　　B: To be honest, how much is culture worth per pound! Production is important, ancient cultural relics cannot
　　be used as rations or underwear; repairing roads, digging wells, and developing production are the central tasks of the whole country at present!
　　It is good for the people to transfer some ancient bricks or melt some Buddhas for "waste utilization"!
　　B's idea represents the ideas of some people. Culture and art cannot be compared with cloth and soybeans in some cases, but as "spiritual food," we cannot live without it. Without this food, the spirit will also starve to death. Starving to death is still a major event, so we have to consider it carefully. Of course, no property belonging to the people is allowed to be destroyed, but destroying a machine can still produce a new one, while destroying an ancient cultural relic often means that there will be no second one in the world. We must also think that when our descendants feel the lack of traditional culture and condemn our rude actions, we will have nothing to say!
　　Thinking of this, I seem to see those eight warriors standing in the dazzling light.

### 一部佛经和八位战士

    一部佛经和八位战士
    黄苗子
    这故事发生在二十年前，地点在山西赵城。
    日本侵略军占据了赵城，他们注意到赵城那座古庙广胜寺，因为庙里有一部著名的佛教大藏经，他们打算把这部佛经抢走。广胜寺的老和尚听得风声，连忙派人报告赵城周围的我游击队。事情经过中共山西省委的决定，当夜就派出了队伍把这部藏经运走，走到半路遭遇上了敌人，一场恶战终于完成了保护这部佛经的任务，但是，为此使得八位英雄的游击队战士英勇地牺牲了。
    这部用八位战士的鲜血换回来的大藏经，经过若干年妥慎保藏，终于在1949年4月随着全国解放运到文化中心的北京。同年9月间，北京图书馆举办了这部藏经的展览会，我当时曾去看过，也正如所有的观众一样，为了看到八百多年前我国古代木板印刷的高度艺术而欣幸，并且为了这部藏经的保存经过而感动。
    这部藏经是金代（约1115—1234）一位信佛的女子崔法珍花了三十年功夫募刻而成，现存有四千三百多卷，它意味着古代东方的文化思想之一部分，也意味着无数先代人民的劳动代价花费在这个上面。拿古代文化史的研究来说，它是不可轻视的一批资料。因此当我看到这部藏经的时候，常常想到这八位战士为了保卫古代文化而献出生命的伟大精神！
    在一次偶然的闲谈中，我讲述了这个故事，也讲到在遥远的甘肃沙漠中，那些为了整理研究敦煌石窟的佛像雕刻而埋头苦干的文化战士们的故事。当时有一位持怀疑态度的同志发问：为什么这些经卷、石雕泥塑的菩萨在解放以后还在大行其道？于是立刻又有一位自作聪明的同志认为解放以后修理了一些庙宇和保存这些遗物只是为了“照顾一些宗教界人士”云云。我看第一位同志提出的问题可以帮助我们深入地认识这个问题，而那位自作聪明的同志的意见却是错误的。
    我想，破除迷信，在新社会里是多数人赞成的。我们花了代价去保卫和保存一些佛像经卷，只说明我们对于古代文化艺术遗产的整理工作的重视。过去几十年在昏天黑地中没有谁可能去顾到它，我们现在生活在一个崭新的社会里，有最进步和最科学的思想武器——马克思列宁主义，这些民族文化遗产将因我们“吸其精华，去其糟粕”而大大地在世界文化上发出光辉。
    我还参加过一次更尖锐的辩论。起因是有人提到我们近几年来在保存和整理文化遗产上有卓越的成就，但也有些叫人痛心的个别事例。他（假定是甲）举出报上刊载的浙江龙泉县拆毁了北宋崇因寺双塔及五代金沙寺塔，用这些塔砖铺路，和某些地方毁坏佛道铜像卖钱，拆去古墓砖修井等事例，于是有人（假定是乙）出而辩护之，其问答如下：
    乙：这也难怪，个别干部文化水平不高，谁又认识什么是精华，
    什么是糟粕呢！
    甲：即使如此，难道国家保护文物的法令不是三令五申过？难道
    上级没有命令保护这些文物？难道服从法令和上级指示不是一个
    干部的起码条件吗？
    乙：老实说，文化值几个钱一斤呢！生产要紧，古代文物一不能
    当口粮，二不能当裤衩；修路打井发展生产是当前全国的中心任
    务！移用一些古砖或者熔掉几个菩萨正好“废物利用”，对人民
    有好处嘛！
    乙的想法正是代表一部分人的想法。文化艺术在某些情况下固然不能和布帛菽粟相比，可是作为“精神食粮”，我们在生活上却也少不了它，没有这些食粮，精神也会饿死，饿死究竟还是事大，就不能不加以细致的考虑。自然，任何属于人民的财产都不容许破坏，但是破坏一部机器还可以生产新的，而破坏了一件古文物，往往就是全世界不可能再有第二件的。我们更不能不想到当我们的子孙在感到传统文化缺少而对我们的粗暴行动加以谴责时，我们是无词以对的呢！
    想到这里，我仿佛看到那八位战士站在耀眼的光辉中。
