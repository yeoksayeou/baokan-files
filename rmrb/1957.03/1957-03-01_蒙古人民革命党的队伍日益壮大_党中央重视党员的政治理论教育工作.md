Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 28th — On the eve of the 36th anniversary of the founding of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (March 1st), Balagan, Minister of the Party Affairs Department of the Central Committee of the Party, spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter about the development of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.

    Balagan said that the number of members of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party reached 40,000 by the end of 1956, an increase of about 5,000 compared with the beginning of 1956.

    Balagan said that the increase in party members and party organizations has strengthened the party's ranks, and party members are playing a greater role in developing the national economy. He pointed out that the party often teaches party members to take the lead in production.

    The Mongolian party attaches importance to the political and theoretical education of party members. There are theoretical study groups in cities, and more than 11,000 party members participate in theoretical studies. There are also fixed study weeks in the countryside. Balagan said that the Party Central Committee also uses methods such as running short-term training courses to improve the political and professional level of cadres. For example, the training course for heads of pastoral cooperatives attached to the Senior Party School has already been held for three sessions. The Party Central Committee also runs a school for studying the Mongolian economy, where many leading cadres of the Party and government have studied.
