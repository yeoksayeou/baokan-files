    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 14th: Hungary recently arrested Ferenc Kish Mihály, a executioner who had been hiding for twelve years since the liberation and who had massacred a large number of communists.

    He was one of the counter-revolutionary ringleaders of the Horthy regime after the overthrow of the Hungarian Soviet Republic in the autumn of 1919, when the White Terror was carried out against communists. In the area where he was active—around the city of Kecskemét—about six hundred people were killed at that time. In 1946, he was charged with the murder of forty-four people, participating in the massacre of one hundred people, and robbery of property. The court had sentenced him to death in absentia.

    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 13th: The Budapest Police Department recently arrested eleven counter-revolutionary bandits hiding in the capital's transportation sector.

    After preliminary interrogation, this group of bandits confessed that they had formulated a plan to carry out armed provocations on March 15th. They had participated in the counter-revolutionary riots in October last year and a series of atrocities afterwards.

    一批准备武装挑衅的反革命匪徒也落网
    新华社布达佩斯14日电  匈牙利最近逮捕了一个在解放以后一直隐藏了十二年的屠杀大批共产党人的刽子手弗朗齐亚·基什·米哈伊。
    他是在1919年秋匈牙利苏维埃政权被颠复后霍尔蒂政权对共产党人施行白色恐怖的反革命头子之一。在他所活动的地区——克奇克梅特城周围，当时曾有六百人左右被杀害。1946年，他被控告犯有屠杀四十四人、参加一百人的大屠杀和抢劫财物等罪名，法庭曾以缺席审判方式对他判处死刑。
    新华社布达佩斯13日电  布达佩斯警察局最近逮捕了隐藏在首都交通运输部门的十一个反革命匪徒。
    经初步审讯，这批匪徒供认他们拟订了准备在3月15日进行武装挑衅的计划。他们曾经参加过去年十月间的反革命暴乱和以后的一连串暴行。
