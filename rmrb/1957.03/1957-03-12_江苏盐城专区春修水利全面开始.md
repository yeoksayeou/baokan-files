    Jiangsu's Yancheng Prefecture has fully commenced spring water conservancy construction.
    
    (By Our Newspaper) More than 230,000 civilian laborers in Yancheng Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, are beginning to construct spring water conservancy projects on the broad fields along the north and south banks of the Irrigation Main Canal and the Chuanchang River.
    
    In early February, the Yancheng Prefectural Administration convened a meeting of the heads of water conservancy sections and bureaus of various counties to conduct comprehensive planning for the spring construction. The total earthwork task for farmland water conservancy in the region was set at over 47.74 million cubic meters, with a total of 3,132 culverts and "ground dragons" (a type of water lifting device). 46% of these projects were completed last winter, and the remaining 54% will be completed this spring. The spring water conservancy projects in Funing and Binhai counties alone involve over 18 million cubic meters of earthwork, exceeding the total of water conservancy projects over the past three years. Upon completion of all these projects, 1,158,000 mu of dry land in the entire prefecture can be converted into paddy fields this spring, extremely favorable conditions can be created for draining waterlogged land for 1,560,000 mu of dry land, and irrigation can be improved for 1,250,000 mu of paddy fields.
