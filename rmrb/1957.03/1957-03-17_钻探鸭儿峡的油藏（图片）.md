Drilling for Oil Deposits in Ya'erxia

After oil was extracted from Well No. 1 in the Ya'erxia exploration area, preliminary oil testing showed that this is an oil deposit with industrial exploitation value. At present, the drilling personnel of the Yumen Mining Bureau are stepping up drilling in the severe cold.
