Xinhua News Agency, March 18th, Manila dispatch: Following the death of Philippine President Magsaysay in a plane crash, Philippine Vice President Garcia was sworn in as president today. Before the swearing-in ceremony, Garcia issued a statement saying that he would implement every policy of Magsaysay in the same way as Magsaysay.

U.S. officials in Manila expressed "deep shock" at Magsaysay's death. They worried that Magsaysay's death would cause the rise of political forces in the Philippines demanding to get rid of American control and worried that the Philippines would experience a "period of political turmoil."

    加西亚接任菲总统
    据新华社18日讯　马尼拉消息：由于菲律宾总统麦格赛赛因飞机失事身死，菲律宾副总统加西亚今天宣誓接任总统职位。加西亚在举行宣誓仪式以前发表声明说，他要像麦格赛赛一样来执行麦格赛赛的每一项政策。
    在马尼拉的美国官员对麦格赛赛身死一事表示“十分震惊”。他们耽心麦格赛赛之死会使菲律宾国内要求摆脱美国控制的政治力量抬头，耽心菲律宾会出现一个“政治上的动荡时期”。
