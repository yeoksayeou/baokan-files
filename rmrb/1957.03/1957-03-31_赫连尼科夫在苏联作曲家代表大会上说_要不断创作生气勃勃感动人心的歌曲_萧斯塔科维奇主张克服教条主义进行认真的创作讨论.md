Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 30th. Khrennikov, General Secretary of the Soviet Composers' Association, told Soviet composers on March 28 that the fundamental line is unwavering: to fight for art filled with highly ideological content that helps educate the people with communist ideas, and to fight for art that attracts people with rich, beautiful, and elegant forms and is closely connected with the lives of the people.

He said that the achievements of Soviet musical creation were obtained through intense struggle against various influences that deviate from the method of socialist realism. This struggle is still ongoing, so firm principles and a clear awareness of the tasks facing Soviet composers are particularly important.

Khrennikov made these remarks in his report at the first day of the Second All-Union Congress of Soviet Composers.

Khrennikov also said that we are proud that, in the current sharp ideological struggle, the works of Soviet composers recognized by world opinion serve the cause of the victory of socialist ideas. Those who are now attacking our artistic position, hoping to weaken it and lead us away from our path, also know this. We should fight against harmful ideas in art with undiminished strength.

Our task is to master the most advanced creative method in art history—the method of socialist realism—more deeply and to constantly create works that move people with vibrant content, noble morality, and high skill.

After Khrennikov's report, Shepilov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, read out the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the congress.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 29th. On the eve of the opening of the Second All-Union Congress of Soviet Composers, the Soviet "Pravda" published an article by the famous Soviet composer Shostakovich on March 27, in which he talked about the need for serious creative discussions and opposed making crude conclusions about creative discussions.

Shostakovich wrote, in this article, I want to mainly talk about an issue that excites me: the issue of our creative discussions. Many people often say that many necessary discussions about creative issues are conducted without vigor, and if we occasionally argue about important issues of modern music, it is generally mostly in the theater corridors. What hinders the wide-ranging development of creative discussions? The most hindering thing is the naive explanation of the problems raised by life as belonging to a certain "group," and the eagerness to draw conclusions and put forward final formulas, which later become dogmas and freeze the development of the debate from the beginning.

Particularly harmful to the discussion is the hasty labeling of the phenomena being discussed with hats that are equivalent to announcing "no discussion," "not worth discussing."

Does this mean that we should artificially ease the criticism of negative phenomena in creation, avoid sharp issues, and not call things by their proper names? Of course not. Only persistent, relentlessly truthful criticism can be effective and authoritative. But precisely because of this, the language of criticism should be the language of truth, and should be the language that proceeds from a huge sense of responsibility and conscience in solving complex problems.

New initiatives in all arts are experimental. And the broader, bolder, and more individual the artist's conception, the more obvious this experimentation becomes, and the more "adventurous" the artist becomes. The artist may also have partial failures or seemingly failures when overcoming the difficulties that arise. But these are not terrible if the artist's general ideas and aesthetic direction are correct and point to the truth of life.

However, some hasty lovers of dogmatic formulas do not pay attention to the complexity and multifaceted nature of the phenomena being discussed. In their eyes, sometimes even the intention to explore the essence of complex phenomena is questionable and comes from the "devil." This leads to superficial and naive arguments, sometimes in the name of Marxist-Leninist aesthetics, but in essence, they undermine the flexible and subtle methods of dialectics in Marxist-Leninist analysis of art.

In discussions, principle and rigor should be linked to patience and passionate concern for complex creative phenomena. Discussion is also creation. In music, we should develop and promote a variety of ideas. Bold innovation is needed in music. Repeating the principles known to everyone like primary and secondary school students cannot push us forward to solve the urgent problems in modern music. We should constantly unravel the complex entanglement of contradictions in twentieth-century music, and we should deeply, not with preconceived patterns, explore the complex process of the development of Soviet music.

In order to study all the issues, we need a research-oriented mind, and we very much need an atmosphere of friendly debate, where there are no dogmatic methods and no harm to either side of the debate.

Shostakovich also mentioned the issue of opera and song creation in this article. This article was written in anticipation of the Second All-Union Congress of Soviet Composers.

    赫连尼科夫在苏联作曲家代表大会上说
    要不断创作生气勃勃感动人心的歌曲
    萧斯塔科维奇主张克服教条主义进行认真的创作讨论
    新华社莫斯科30日电　苏联作曲家协会总书记赫连尼科夫3月28日向苏联作曲家们说，为充满高度思想内容和有助于以共产主义思想教育人民的艺术而斗争，为以形式的丰富、美丽和优雅来吸引人和同人民生活有紧密联系的艺术而斗争——这个基本路线是不可动摇的。
    他说，苏联音乐创作的成就，是在同有别于社会主义现实主义方法的各种影响作紧张斗争中取得的。这一斗争还在继续，因此，坚定的原则性、明确地意识到苏联作曲家面临的任务，是特别重要的。
    赫连尼科夫的这番话是他在苏联第二届全国作曲家代表大会第一天会议上作报告的时候说的。
    赫连尼科夫还说，我们引为自豪的是，在目前尖锐的思想斗争中，世界舆论所公认的苏联作曲家的作品是为社会主义思想胜利的事业服务的。那些现在攻击我们艺术立场、指望削弱它和使我们离开我们道路的人，也知道这一点。我们应当以丝毫不减弱的力量为反对艺术中的有害思想而斗争。
    我们的任务是，更深刻地掌握艺术史上最先进的创作方法——社会主义现实主义的方法，不断地创作出以生气勃勃的内容、高尚的道德和高度的技巧来感动人的作品。
    赫连尼科夫的报告结束后，苏联共产党中央委员会书记谢皮洛夫宣读了苏共中央给代表大会的贺词。
    新华社莫斯科29日电　在苏联作曲家第二届全国代表大会开幕前夕，苏联“真理报”在3月27日发表了苏联著名作曲家萧斯塔科维奇的一篇文章，他谈到应该进行认真的创作讨论，反对对创作讨论作出粗率的结论。
    萧斯塔科维奇写道，在这篇文章里，我想主要地谈一个使我激动的问题：关于我们创作讨论的问题。许多人常常说，许多关于创作问题的必要的讨论进行得没有生气，如果我们也不时争论近代音乐的重要问题的话，一般多半是在剧院走廊里。什么东西妨碍了创作讨论的广泛展开呢？其中最有妨碍的是把生活所提出来的问题当作某“一伙人的”幼稚的解释，是急于作出总结，提出最后的公式，而这种公式以后变成教条，一开始就冻结了争论的发展。
    对讨论特别有害的是对所讨论的现象轻率匆忙地扣上这样一些帽子，而这些帽子就等于宣布“不要讨论”，“不值得讨论”。
    这是否说，我们应该人为地缓和对创作中消极现象的批评，回避尖锐问题，不说出事物的合适的名字呢？当然不是。只有坚持到底的无情真实的批评才可能是有效的和有威信的。但是正因为如此，批评的言语应该是真理的语言，应该是从解决复杂问题的巨大责任感和良心出发的语言。
    一切艺术中的新创始都是带有试验性的。而且艺术家的构思更加广阔、愈加大胆、愈加富有个人特点，那么这种试验性就愈加明显，艺术家就愈加“冒险”。艺术家克服发生的困难时也会有部分的失败或初看起来的失败。但这些并不可怕，如果艺术家总的思想和美学方向是正确的、是指向生活真实的。
    但是某些匆匆忙忙的教条公式的爱好者都不注意所讨论现象的复杂性和多方面性。在他们有时看来，连想探明复杂现象的本质的意图都是可疑的，是从“恶魔”那里走来的。这样就产生了肤浅的幼稚的论断，有时也用马克思列宁主义美学的名义，但实质上是破坏了马克思列宁主义分析艺术的辩证法的灵活和精细方法。
    在讨论中应该把原则性和严格同对复杂创作现象的耐心和热情关怀联系起来。讨论也同样是创作。在音乐中，我们应该发展和繁荣多种多样的思想。在音乐中需要大胆的革新。像中小学生一样的重复大家所知的原理一步也不能推动我们去解决近代音乐中的迫切问题。我们应该经常解开二十世纪音乐中矛盾的复杂纠葛，应该深入地，不是事先预定好图式的，探究苏联音乐发展的复杂过程。
    为了研究所有的问题，我们需要有研究的思想，十分需要友好的争论空气，哪里没有教条的方法，也就没有对争论两方任何一方的伤害。
    萧斯塔科维奇在这篇文章中还提到了歌剧、歌曲创作的问题。这篇文章是为迎接苏联作曲家第二届全国代表大会写的。
