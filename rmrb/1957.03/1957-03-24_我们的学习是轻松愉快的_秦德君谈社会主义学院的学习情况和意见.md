　　Our Learning is Relaxed and Happy
　　Qin Dejun Discusses the Learning Situation and Opinions at the Socialist Academy
    Today, I will talk about our learning experience as a student of the Socialist Academy.

    The first session of this academy started on October 15th last year and will end in November this year. Among our classmates are People's Representatives, members of the CPPCC, central committee members of various democratic parties, as well as experts, professors, engineers, etc., all of whom voluntarily applied to study here. The subjects we study are dialectical materialism and historical materialism, political economy, and the history of the Chinese revolution. We have classes four days a week, two to three sessions a day, each session lasting 45 to 50 minutes, and we have a discussion once a week. In addition, we also study current events and policies, visit socialist construction projects, and so on. Our learning is relaxed and happy.

    The average age of our classmates is around fifty-four years old. The reason why we can carry out theoretical learning in a relaxed and happy manner is that the Socialist Academy adopts a teaching method that emphasizes voluntariness, self-awareness, free debate, and reasoning. In our learning, we can freely delve into the material, think independently, and have democratic discussions. We can say whatever we want and express our opinions as they are, without rigidly binding people's thoughts. Our study of Marxist-Leninist theory is based on self-awareness and voluntariness.

    The Socialist Academy also adopts the "five nos" measures in teaching administration, which means no exams or tests are held at the time of enrollment, no survey registration forms are filled out, no history is reviewed, no ideology is examined, and no exams or tests are held at the time of graduation. These measures have played a great role in enabling students to study with peace of mind.

    In the past few months, we have been studying with full enthusiasm and great interest. Although some of our classmates are gray-haired and have long beards, none of them is ever late or leaves early. In group discussions, sometimes we argue fiercely over a problem until our faces turn red. We are becoming more and more energetic as we learn, and we feel the preciousness of theoretical learning more and more. And everyone feels that they are becoming younger.

    After these few months of learning, each of us has gained something. Many of the CPPCC members present today have studied at the Socialist Academy, so I won't say much more. Here I have two suggestions:

      (1) I think it is very meaningful for the National Committee to organize such studies for non-Communist and older senior cadres, and it is important for consolidating the united front and giving play to its active role. Therefore, I suggest that in addition to the National Committee continuing to attach importance to this work, it should also regularly supervise and promote this work in various local CPPCCs. Because as far as I know, since the National Committee issued the "Decision on Organizing Political and Theoretical Study for People from All Walks of Life and Industrialists and Businessmen" last year, although it has attracted the attention of local CPPCCs, the development is still uneven. For example, the number of places that have established political schools across the country is still not widespread enough.

      (2) When organizing such studies, those in charge need to pay close attention to the special circumstances of these students and should not demand too much too quickly or too strictly. In our Socialist Academy, we pay great attention to the implementation of the teaching methods of self-awareness, voluntariness, free debate, and reasoning, and we have done a very good job in this regard. Because the average age of our 160-plus students is around fifty-four years old, we cannot demand as strictly as we do for college and middle school students. At the same time, such students have considerable cultivation and self-awareness in learning. However, in the political and theoretical learning organizations run by various local CPPCCs, has this characteristic been taken into consideration as much as in the Socialist Academy? This cannot be ignored.

    Suggestion to Establish New-Type "Pawnshops" in Large and Medium-Sized Cities to Help People Store Clothes and Help People with Economic Circulation

    I also have a suggestion regarding social welfare undertakings: A month ago, I saw an article in the Beijing Daily introducing the "pawnshops" in Moscow. Moscow's "pawnshops" are completely different from the old-fashioned pawnshops in China that exploited people with high interest rates. It is an urban service enterprise. It has good storage facilities and scientific storage methods. People can send their clothes for storage and only pay a small storage fee. It also helps people with economic circulation. People can send their clothes that are not urgently needed for mortgage when they are short of money, and the "pawnshop" only charges a small amount of interest equivalent to the storage fee. I think it is very necessary to set up such service enterprises in large and medium-sized cities in our country. Because it not only brings convenience to the masses, saves housing for the country, but also accumulates funds for construction. Today, many cadres have two houses that are enough to live in, but in the summer, cotton clothes, quilts, etc. are squeezed into the room, making people feel unbearably hot. If we have such storage facilities as the Moscow "pawnshop," people would not have to buy suitcases and wooden cabinets to store clothes in every household, and the country can save leather and wood for important construction; at the same time, we can also further streamline plans when building office dormitories and general people's residences, turning the storage rooms of each household into living quarters, greatly improving the utilization rate of houses. Therefore, I suggest that the urban service department set up such enterprises. (Attached picture)

　　我们的学习是轻松愉快的
　　秦德君谈社会主义学院的学习情况和意见
    我今天以社会主义学院的一个学生的身份来谈谈我们学习的经过。
    这个学院第一期是在去年10月15号开学的，要到今年11月才结束。我们的同学中间有人民代表、政协委员、各民主党派的中央委员，还有专家、教授、工程师等等，都是自愿的申请来学习的。学习的功课有辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义、政治经济学、中国革命史。每周上课四天，每天上两节课到三节课，每节课是45到50分钟，每周讨论一次。此外我们还学习时事政策，参观社会主义建设工程等等。我们的学习是轻松愉快的。
    我们同学的年龄平均在五十四岁左右，还能够轻松愉快地来进行理论学习的原因，就是这个社会主义学院采取自愿、自觉、自由辩论、讲通道理的教学方法。我们在学习中可以自由钻研、独立思考、民主讨论，有什么就说什么，是什么见解就怎么见解，并不硬用一条绳子来把人们的思想束缚住。我们对马克思列宁主义理论的钻研，是以自觉自愿作基础的。
    社会主义学院在教学行政上，还采取了“五不”措施，就是入学时不举行考试和测验，不填写调查登记表，不审查历史，不检查思想，结业时也不举行考试和测验。这些措施，对于学员们能够安心学习，起了很大的作用。
    这几个月以来，我们在学习中都是精神饱满的、兴趣勃勃地，尽管有的同学已是白发苍苍、胡须浩然的老前辈，也都从不迟到早退，在小组讨论中，有时候为一个问题的辩论，还争论得面红耳赤。真是越学越有劲头，越学越感到理论学习的可宝贵。而且一个个都感到自己更加年轻起来了。
    经过这几个月的学习，我们各人都有各人的收获，今天在座的政协委员同志中间，有好些个都是在社会主义学院学习的，我就不再多谈了。在这里我有两点建议：
      （一）我认为全国委员会为非共产党的以及年长的高级干部举办这样的学习，是非常有意义的，对于统一战线的巩固和发挥它的积极作用是有重要性的。因此我建议除了全国委员会继续重视这一工作之外，还要经常督促和推动各个地方政协的这一工作。因为据我所知道的，从去年全国委员会“关于组织各界民主人士和工商业者进行政治学习和理论学习的决定”发出以后，虽然引起了各地政协的重视，但是发展还不平衡。例如：全国至今开办政治学校的地方，还不够普遍。
      （二）组织这样的学习，主持的人需要十分重视这些学员们的特殊情况，不能要求得过急和过严。在我们社会主义学院，对于自觉、自愿、自由辩论、讲通道理的教学方法的贯彻，是很注意的，而且也做得很好。因为我们一百六十多位同学的平均年龄是在五十四岁左右的人了，不能像对于大中学生那样的要求严格。同时这样的学生都是有相当的修养和学习的自觉性的。但是，在各个地方政协所办的政治理论学习组织中，是否也像社会主义学院这样注意到了这个特点？是不可忽视的。
    建议在大中城市设立新型“当铺”，以便人们保管衣物，并帮助人们经济上的流通
    我还有一个关于社会福利事业的建议：一个月前在北京日报上看见一篇介绍莫斯科“当铺”的文章。莫斯科“当铺”完全不同于旧中国那种高利剥削的当铺。它是个城市服务企业。它有良好的保管设备和科学的保管方法。人们可以把衣物送去保管，只取很少的保管费。它也帮助人们经济上的流通，人们可以在一旦缺钱时将不急用的衣物送去抵押，“当铺”只收很少的相当于保管费的利息。我认为很有必要在我国大中城市兴办这样的服务企业。因为它既给群众带来方便，为国家节约房屋，又可为建设积累资金。今天有许多干部有两间住房本来是就够住的，可是到了夏天，棉衣、棉被等物挤在房间里，热得人透不过气来。如果我们有莫斯科
  “当铺”这样的保管设备，人们就可以不必家家都买皮箱、木柜来存放衣物，国家就可以节约皮张、木材用于重要的建设；同时还可以在修建机关宿舍、一般人民住宅时更加精简计划，变每家每户的储藏室为住屋，大大提高房屋的利用率。故我建议由城市服务部兴办这样的企业。（附图片）
