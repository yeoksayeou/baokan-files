Helping Commune Members and the Masses Educate Themselves
　　By our reporter Shang Kai
Editor's Note: Recently, in many areas that have had good harvests and are in relatively good condition, some commune cadres and members have developed complacency; while in areas that have had poor harvests and are in poor condition, some commune cadres have lost their confidence in progress. The result of these two unhealthy tendencies in thinking and emotion is the same: a relaxation of preparations for striving for a bumper harvest this year. An effective way to solve this problem is to use local specific facts to inspire the masses to educate themselves. The Yuci County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party did this very timely, so Yuci County is at the forefront of the entire district's spring plowing and various production activities. This newspaper reporter reported on the experience of the Yuci County Party Committee in this work, which is worthy of attention. Now that spring plowing and production have begun successively in various places, when conducting this kind of education, special attention should be paid to adopting flexible methods to adapt to the specific circumstances of the time and place; try to hold as few mass meetings as possible and organize as few visits as possible. In short, it should be required to be conducive to spring plowing without hindering spring plowing.
    The Yuci Special District of Shanxi is fully mobilizing for spring plowing. A production upsurge has first formed in Yuci County. Judging from the entire district, Yuci County's spring plowing preparation work has always been far ahead.
    Why is Yuci County's spring plowing and production activity able to be ahead of other counties and quickly form an upsurge? There is no secret to this. The main reason is that the Yuci County Party Committee has closely grasped the agricultural season and carried out ideological mobilization early, universally, and deeply, and the ideological problems have been resolved quickly and thoroughly.
    After the rectification of communes last winter, the production mood of the masses in Yuci County was basically full; however, some commune cadres and members of the masses still had two unhealthy thoughts: one was complacency, mainly manifested in some of the masses in areas with a foundation in cooperative production. They were satisfied with the fact that the spring plowing preparation work was done well, and they were satisfied with the achievements made in agricultural capital construction in recent years, and they felt that there was no need to make much more effort. Some people regarded continuing to build water conservancy projects and increasing fertilizer production measures as "the same old routine" and were not very interested. The other was pessimism, mainly manifested in some of the masses in mountainous areas with poor natural conditions. They believed that mountainous areas had no future, had no confidence in increasing production, and were not at ease with agricultural production. When observing problems, they often emphasized one side and ignored the other, thus generating wrong perceptions. They also have a common characteristic: they believe in reality the most. As long as the facts are fully presented and used to educate and persuade them, all misconceptions will be easily solved. The Yuci County Party Committee closely grasped this law in the process of mobilizing the masses for spring plowing. After overcoming the right-leaning conservative thinking of the grassroots cadres, they immediately divided the county into seventy areas and convened mass spring plowing mobilization meetings with a duration of one to two days. In addition to making general spring plowing production mobilization reports, the main method of mobilizing the masses was to summarize last year's production increase achievements, exchange production increase experiences, and inspect the current spring plowing preparation work, so that the masses could educate themselves. This approach quickly achieved results. Here are just two examples to illustrate:
    Zhangqing Township is a township in the county where production work has been done relatively well. Therefore, complacency is also relatively serious among some commune cadres and members of the masses. For example, when some communes accumulated fertilizer to 60 dan per mu, they believed that they had "reached the top," and they also felt that all other work had been done almost enough. In order to overcome this complacency, the county party committee helped township cadres organize cross-inspections between communes. In the Shuguang Commune, it was inspected that: the wheat fields had not yet been harrowed and ground, and the land renovation plan had only been completed by 60%. How could they say there was no work to be done? There were many rotten straw, rotten grass, ash soil, and garbage heaps in the village, which could accumulate more than 10,000 dan of fertilizer. How could they say that fertilizer accumulation had "reached the top"? Many similar situations were also inspected in other communes. Faced with these practical problems, complacency disappeared imperceptibly. The entire township found five more sources of fertilizer only in terms of fertilizer accumulation, and the communes revised their fertilizer accumulation plans one after another. The original plan of the Shuguang Commune was to apply 70 dan of fertilizer per mu, which was later increased to 80 dan; the original plan was to apply topdressing to 600 mu of wheat, which was later increased to 1,100 mu.
    In mountainous areas, in addition to helping the masses summarize the favorable conditions for agricultural production this year, the county party committee also invited members of the Beishan Agricultural Cooperative, which had achieved success in building mountainous areas, to introduce the changes in their production and life in recent years to other cooperatives. People from communes not far from Beishan Cooperative personally went to visit. The masses in the mountainous areas all knew that Beishan Cooperative was originally a barren mountain village like everyone else. In the past, the entire village had 31 households with 102 people, only two donkeys, and planted more than 540 mu of land. The grain harvested every year was not enough to eat for half a year. At that time, the entire village had no more than 40 quilts, and more than 60 people could not wear cotton clothes in winter. What about now? The face of this mountain village has completely changed. The number of livestock has increased to 17, and the number of sheep has increased to 180. In 1956, the total grain output of the entire cooperative increased from 25,000 jin in the past to 140,000 jin, and the 1,300 fruit trees alone earned more than 46,000 yuan. After the fall settlement, the average income per household was more than 1,300 yuan. The entire village has newly built 61 houses, and now each person has an average of two quilts and four sets of new and old clothes, and more than 160 people have put on sweaters and down jackets. In addition, everyone has more than 13,000 yuan in savings in the bank. This vivid example aroused great interest among the masses of various cooperatives. In the discussion, they all said: "It's only been a few years! Such a big change has taken place in Beishan Village!" In fact, what is so strange about this? Beishan Village, like other villages in the mountainous area, does not have a unique advantage. There is only one thing, that is, the people of Beishan Village have worked hard for several years and resolutely implemented the party's policy of building mountainous areas. The example of Beishan Village has educated the masses in the mountainous areas, enabling everyone to see the direction of building the mountainous areas and inspiring confidence in building the mountainous areas. Now, many agricultural cooperatives in the mountainous areas are closely combining with production activities and are brewing to formulate a comprehensive plan for developing production in the mountainous areas.
    At present, it seems that a spring plowing production movement with thousands of troops and horses has already begun in the entire county. Under the new situation, new problems have emerged—in some areas, when the masses have already acted, a series of specific organizational work has not kept up in time. The plans for contracting work and production have not yet been arranged to the production teams in some cooperatives; although they have been arranged to the teams, no specific arrangements have been made. Therefore, the phenomenon of chaotic production order has appeared in some cooperatives. This shows that when the masses have already been mobilized, leading cadres at all levels must not be satisfied with the sensational form, but must immediately go deep into each cooperative, each team, and each group to help the masses organize production and overcome difficulties.
    The Yuci County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has realized this and promptly transferred 120 cadres from the county-level organs, who have already gone to the countryside separately. The task assigned to them by the county party committee is to lead the spring plowing production from a high tide to a higher high tide.

### 帮助社员群众自己教育自己

　　帮助社员群众自己教育自己
　　本报记者　商恺
    编者按　近来在许多丰收了的和条件较好的地区，有些社干部和社员产生了自满情绪；而在歉收的和条件较差的地区，有些社干部却丧失了前进的信心。这两种思想情绪上的不健康的倾向，造成的结果是一样的，就是放松了争取今年大丰收的准备工作。解决这个问题的有效办法，是用当地的具体事实，启发群众自己教育自己。中共榆次县委很及时地这样做了，因此，榆次县在全专区的备耕和各项生产活动中走在最前面。本报记者报道了榆次县委在这个工作中的经验，是值得重视的。现在各地的春耕生产已经陆续开始，进行这种教育的时候，应当特别注意采取灵活的方式，适应当时当地的具体情况；要尽可能地少开群众大会，少组织参观。总之，要求有利于春耕而不妨碍春耕。
    山西榆次专区正在全力发动春耕。生产高潮已经首先在榆次县形成。从全区看来，榆次县的春耕准备工作，一直遥遥领先。
    榆次县的春耕生产活动为什么能够走在其他各县的前面，而且很快地形成了高潮呢？这并没有什么秘诀，主要是由于榆次县委紧紧地掌握住了农时，及早地普遍地深入地进行了思想发动，思想问题解决得快而且透。
    去冬整社以后，榆次县群众的生产情绪基本上是饱满的；但是，一部分社干部和社员群众还有两种不健康的思想：一种是自满情绪，主要表现在合作化生产有基础的地区的一部分群众中，他们满足于备耕工作作得较好，满足于几年来在农业基本建设方面取得的成绩，认为无须再作多大的努力了。有人把继续兴修水利、增加肥料的增产措施，看成是“老一套”，兴趣不高。另一种是悲观情绪，主要表现在自然条件较差的山区一部分群众中，他们认为山区没前途，对增产没信心，不安心于农业生产。他们在观察问题的时候，常常是强调了一面，忽视了另一面，从而产生了错误的认识。他们也有一个共同的特点：最相信实际。只要把事实全面摆出来，用以教育和说服他们，一切错误认识都会迎刃而解。榆次县委在发动群众备耕的过程中，就紧紧地掌握了这个规律。他们在克服了基层干部的右倾保守思想以后，立即把全县划分成七十个地片，以一天至两天的时间，召开了群众性的春耕动员大会。除了作一般的春耕生产动员报告以外，动员群众的主要办法是总结去年增产成绩，交流增产经验，检查当前备耕工作，让群众自己教育自己。这种做法迅速地收到了效果。这里只举两个例子来说明：
    张庆乡是全县生产工作搞得比较好的一个乡，因而在一部分社干部和社员群众中，自满情绪也比较严重。比如有的社积肥达到每亩六十担的时候，便认为“到顶”了，对其他工作，也认为都作的差不多了。为了克服这种自满情绪，县委帮助乡干部组织了社与社之间的交叉检查。在曙光社里，便检查出：麦田还没有耙磨，整修土地的计划才完成了60％，怎么能说没活可干了呢？村里有许多烂秸烂草、灰土和垃圾堆，可积肥一万多担，怎么能说积肥“到顶”了呢？在其他社里也检查出了许多类似的情况。面对着这些实际问题，自满情绪无形中便消除了。全乡仅在积肥方面，又找到了五种肥源；各社纷纷修订积肥计划。曙光社原计划每亩施肥七十担，后来增加到八十担；原计划小麦施追肥六百亩，后来增加到一千一百亩。
    在山区，县委除了帮助群众总结今年农业生产的有利条件以外，又请建设山区有成绩的北山农业社的社员向别的社介绍他们几年来生产和生活的变化。离北山社不很远的社，有人亲自前往参观。山区的群众谁都知道，北山社原是同大家一样的贫瘠山村。过去，全村三十一户，一百零二口人，只有两头驴子，种着五百四十多亩土地，每年打的粮食不够半年吃；那时候，全村也不过有四十床被子，到冬天穿不上棉衣的有六十多人。现在呢？这个山村的面貌完全变了，牲畜已经增加到十七头，羊增加到一百八十只，1956年全社粮食总产量已由过去的二万五千斤提高到十四万斤，仅一千三百株果木树就收入了四万六千多元。秋后结账，每户平均收入一千三百多元。全村新修盖了住宅六十一间，现在每人平均有被子两床、新旧衣服四套，有一百六十多人穿上了毛衣和绒衣。另外，大家在银行的存款还有一万三千多元。这个活生生的例子，引起了各社群众极大的兴趣。在讨论中都说：“这才几年啊！北山村就发生了这么大的变化！”其实，这有什么奇怪的？北山村和山区其他村子一样，并没有得天独厚的地方，只不过有一条，那就是北山村的人们经过几年以来的辛勤劳动，坚决执行了党的建设山区的方针。北山村的事例教育了山区的群众，使大家看到了建设山区的方向，鼓舞了建设山区的信心。现在，山区的许多农业社都在紧密地结合着生产活动，酝酿制订发展山区生产的全面规划。
    目前看来，一个千军万马的春耕生产运动已经在全县展开了。在新的形势下，出现了新的问题——在一些地区，当群众已经行动起来的时候，一系列的具体组织工作没有及时赶上去。有的社包工包产的计划还没有布置到生产队；有的虽然布置到队里了，但还没有作具体的安排。因此，在一部分社里出现了生产秩序混乱的现象。这说明，当群众已经发动起来以后，各级领导干部决不能满足于轰轰烈烈的形式，而必须立即深入到各社各队各组，帮助群众组织生产，克服困难。
    中共榆次县委认识到了这一点，及时地从县级机关抽调了一百二十名干部，已经分头下乡去了。县委给他们的任务是：把春耕生产从高潮引向更高的高潮。
