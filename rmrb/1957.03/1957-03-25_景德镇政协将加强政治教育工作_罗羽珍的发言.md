The Jingdezhen CPPCC to Strengthen Political Education Work
Luo Yuzhen's Speech

I am very happy to be in Beijing for the first time and honored to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC. I am particularly honored to have attended the Supreme State Council meeting and listened to the instructions of our beloved and great leader Chairman Mao Zedong. I listened to Premier Zhou Enlai's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of the proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee, which gave me a very profound education and inspiration, and made me feel excited and encouraged. I express my heartfelt support.

In the past few years, under the wise and correct leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our motherland has achieved brilliant achievements on all fronts. Whether in cities or villages, industry or agriculture, a new atmosphere of vigorous development has emerged everywhere, which is exciting and satisfying. Take Jingdezhen City, Jiangxi Province, for example, which is a city concentrated with handicrafts and a porcelain city famous at home and abroad. In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, industrial construction, mainly porcelain production, has greatly developed. The great cause of socialist transformation has also been basically completed, like in other parts of the country. Compared with before liberation, porcelain production has not only greatly increased in output and greatly improved in technology, but also greatly improved in quality. In recent years, friends and experts from the Soviet Union and fraternal countries have continuously visited Jingdezhen City for observation and guidance. Tibetan brothers' visiting groups have also visited Jingdezhen City several times. This has not only added glory to Jingdezhen City, but also given great encouragement and strength to the people of Jingdezhen City, especially the working people on the porcelain production front. They all unanimously reflect that they will redouble their efforts to produce more and better porcelain to meet the growing needs of domestic and foreign markets. Due to the rapid development of porcelain production, the corresponding number of employed people has also increased, which has solved the unemployment problem in Jingdezhen City. Now, except for those who generally undertake household labor, are old and weak, and some who currently have no employment conditions, the phenomenon of unemployment has been basically eliminated. This is a concrete manifestation of the superiority of the socialist system under the leadership of the Communist Party. Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his explanation on several issues of the proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan at the meeting: "Regarding the path of industrialization in our country, from the perspective of long-term interests and long-term arrangements, developing heavy industry through the development of agriculture and light industry, some enterprises (mainly the original ones) adopt general technical equipment, adopt semi-mechanization and manual labor, and can employ more people." This is in line with objective reality and is completely correct. We should follow the Second Five-Year Plan in the future.

The work of the Jingdezhen City Committee of the CPPCC of Jiangxi Province is carried out under the direct leadership of the local Party committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the direct guidance of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, in accordance with the spirit of the seven guidelines of the General Program of the Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. It mainly focuses on some political consultation work in conjunction with the central tasks of the local Party and government, organizing and promoting the study of people from all walks of life, and contacting people in society. Through various forms of meetings, such as the Standing Committee, bi-weekly symposiums, current affairs and policy symposiums, report meetings, important commemorative meetings, cultural and recreational activities, and visits and working group activities, it has played a certain role in assisting the Party and government in implementing various policies and laws, improving the ideological understanding and political awareness of people from all walks of life, and expanding and strengthening unity. Especially in terms of learning, we organized people from all walks of life and industrialists and businessmen to study under the "three self" teaching policy, in accordance with the decision issued by the CPPCC National Committee on organizing democratic people and industrialists and businessmen from all walks of life to conduct political and theoretical study. In terms of the industrial and commercial circles, with the attention of the local Party committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the support of all parties, we cooperated with the Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce to establish short-term political study classes for industrialists and businessmen to conduct more systematic political and theoretical study. They are all very enthusiastic about this study. Through study, the political awareness and ideological level of the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen have been improved to varying degrees. They initially understood what capitalism and what socialism are, and why industrialists and businessmen should accept socialist transformation. Many people reflected that before studying, they were not clear about the difference between capitalism and socialism, and the state's peaceful transformation policy for capitalist industry and commerce. After studying, they have recognized it and understood the principles of "destroying capitalism and establishing socialism," the laws of social development, and that labor is glorious and exploitation is shameful, thereby enhancing their confidence in accepting socialist transformation and their willingness to take the socialist road. Some have also changed their actions due to the improvement of their ideological understanding. Many industrialists and businessmen are actively responsible in their work in enterprises, put forward rationalization proposals, and some participate in socialist labor competitions, making achievements and winning the honorary titles of advanced producers, advanced workers, and socialist activists. Some take the initiative to improve their working relationship with public representatives and employees. In addition, many practicing traditional Chinese medicine doctors have improved their political awareness through study and voluntarily left their jobs to participate in public hospitals and factory and mining medical work. Many people in society, after studying, criticized the past idea that the country has a future but individuals do not, and recognized the brilliance and greatness of the Chinese Communist Party, thereby shortening the distance between them and the Communist Party and the People's Government. They support socialism and are willing to serve socialism. This shows the effect of learning and the correctness of the Communist Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming. Although our work has yielded some gains, there are also many shortcomings: the main ones are that political consultation work is not frequent and the quality is not high, and the contact with people from all walks of life is not extensive and in-depth. We have not grasped the study tightly enough, and the implementation of the "three self" teaching policy is insufficient, and the political and ideological education work is poorly done. Therefore, some people believe that the socialist revolution has achieved a great victory, and ideological transformation can come slowly; some people attach importance to business and ignore politics; some people are not active or proactive in their work; and some people are hesitant in their work and have feelings of inferiority. These phenomena are all bad. We must follow the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions at this Supreme State Council meeting, strengthen political and ideological education, and continue to help them carry out ideological transformation so that they can play an active role in the socialist construction cause.

It is very good that members of the CPPCC National Committee go to various provinces, cities, and counties for inspection every year. However, they focus on inspecting the situation of industrial and agricultural production, urban construction, culture, education, health, and political and legal work. Some members do not provide enough specific guidance on the work of the CPPCC. It is suggested that members of the CPPCC National Committee should also take into account the inspection of local CPPCC work and provide specific guidance and assistance when they go to various places for inspection in the future. In order to expand democratic life and absorb the opinions of people from all walks of life, it is also suggested that the CPPCC National Committee transfer to the State Council to instruct local governments at all levels (where there are CPPCC organizations) to submit major national policies and various important local measures to the CPPCC Committee for consultation, fully exchange opinions, so that various policies and measures can be more perfect and ideological understanding can be more consistent, in order to give play to the due role of the CPPCC.

Under the situation that our motherland has achieved great achievements in socialist construction, the socialist revolution has been basically completed, the class relationship has undergone fundamental changes, and the people's democratic united front has been increasingly consolidated and expanded, let us unite more closely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and further strengthen unity according to the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," unite all forces that can be united, and mobilize all positive factors to serve socialism.

### 景德镇政协将加强政治教育工作　罗羽珍的发言

　　景德镇政协将加强政治教育工作
　　罗羽珍的发言
    我首次来到北京，光荣地列席政协第二届全国委员会第三次全体会议，感到非常高兴，特别是参加了最高国务会议，亲听了我们敬爱的伟大的领袖毛泽东主席的指示，更加觉得荣幸。我听了周恩来总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一个国家的报告、李富春副总理关于第二个五年计划建议的说明、以及陈叔通副主席所作的关于政协全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告，使我受到极深刻的教育和启发，也使我感到兴奋和鼓舞，我表示衷心的拥护。
    祖国几年来在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席英明正确领导下，在各个战线上都取得了辉煌的成就。无论是城市和农村，无论是工业和农业，到处都出现了蓬勃发展的新气象，这是令人振奋和满意的。拿江西省景德镇市来说，是手工业集中的城市，也是国内外闻名的瓷城，几年来工业建设，主要是瓷业生产，在中国共产党和人民政府正确领导下，有很大的发展，伟大的社会主义改造事业，也和全国各地一样，已经基本完成。瓷业生产比解放以前，不仅产量有很大提高，技术有很大改进，而且质量也有很大提高。近年来，苏联和各兄弟国家的朋友、专家们不断莅临景德镇市参观和指导，西藏地区兄弟民族参观团，并几次到景德镇市参观，这不仅为景德镇市增了光，也给景德镇市人民、特别是瓷业生产战线上的劳动人民很大的鼓舞和力量，他（她）们都一致反映，要加倍努力，生产更多更好的瓷器，来满足国内外市场不断增长的需要。由于瓷业生产的发展迅速，相应地就业人数也就增加，这就解决了景德镇市的失业问题。现在除一般担负家务劳动、年老体弱和一些目前尚无就业条件者外，已基本上消灭了失业的现象。这是共产党领导下，社会主义制度优越性的具体表现。李富春副总理在会议上所作的关于第二个五年计划建议的若干问题的说明中指出：“关于我国工业化的道路，从长远利益和长远安排着眼，通过农业轻工业的发展来发展重工业，某些企业（主要原有的）采取一般的技术装备，采取半机械化和手工劳动，可以多就业一些人”。这是符合客观实际情况的，也是完全正确的。我们今后应按照第二个五年计划去做。
    政协江西省景德镇市委员会的工作，是在当地中共党委直接领导与政协江西省委员会直接指导下，根据中国人民政治协商会议章程总纲七项准则的精神进行的。主要是结合当地党政的中心任务，进行一些政治协商工作，组织和推动各界人士的学习，和联系社会人士等。通过各种形式的会议，如常委会、双周座谈会、时事政策座谈会、报告会、重要纪念会、文娱活动和参观及工作组活动等等，对协助党政贯彻执行各种政策法令，提高各界人士的思想认识，和政治觉悟扩大和增强团结，起了一定的作用。尤其是学习方面，我们 依据政协全国委员会颁发的，关于组织各界民主人士和工商业者进行政治学习和理论学习的决定，在“三自”教学方针下，组织各界民主人士和工商业者进行学习。工商界方面在当地中共党委重视和各方面支持下，我们与民建和工商联配合，成立了工商业者短期政治讲习班，对他们进行比较系统的政治理论学习。他们对这个学习，情绪都很高。通过学习，绝大多数工商业者的政治觉悟和思想水平，都有不同程度的提高。初步认识了什么是资本主义和什么是社会主义，以及工商业者为什么要接受社会主义改造等道理。有许多人反映：在学习以前，对于资本主义和社会主义的区别，国家对资本主义工商业者的和平改造的方针政策认识不清楚，经过学习，已认清楚了，而且懂得“破资本主义，立社会主义”的道理，和社会发展的规律，以及劳动光荣、剥削可耻，从而提高了接受社会主义改造和愿意走社会主义道路的信心。有的由于思想认识有所提高，在行动上也有所改变。许多工商业者们在企业的工作上，积极负责，提出合理化建议，有的参加社会主义劳动竞赛，做出了成绩，获得先进生产者和先进工作者及社会主义积极分子的光荣称号。有的主动改进同公方代表和职工的共事关系。另有许多开业中医师，通过学习，提高了政治觉悟，自愿脱产参加公立医院和厂矿医疗工作。许多社会人士，经过学习，批判了过去认为国家有前途，个人无前途的思想，认识了中国共产党的英明、伟大，从而缩短了他们与共产党和人民政府的距离。他们拥护社会主义，愿为社会主义服务。这表明学习的效果，也是共产党团结、教育、改造政策的正确。虽然我们的工作有一些收获，但也存在不少缺点：主要的是政治协商工作不经常，质量也不高，对联系各界人士不够广泛深入。对学习抓的不够紧，贯彻“三自”教学方针不够，政治思想教育工作做的差。因此，有些人认为社会主义革命已取得了伟大胜利，思想改造可以慢慢来；有的人重视业务，忽视政治，有的人在工作上不积极，不主动，有的人工作缩手缩脚，存在自卑情绪。这些现象都是不好的。我们必须遵照毛主席这次在最高国务会议上的指示精神，加强政治思想教育工作，继续帮助他们进行思想改造，使他们在社会主义建设事业中，发挥积极作用。
    政协全国委员会委员，每年分赴各省、市、县视察，这是很好的。但是他们着重视察工农业生产情况、城市建设、文教、卫生及政法工作等。有的委员对政协工作具体指导不够，建议政协全国委员会委员今后到各地视察时，应兼顾视察地方政协工作，并给予具体指导和帮助。为了扩大民主生活，吸收各界人士的意见，还建议政协全国委员会转请国务院指示各级地方政府（有政协组织的地方）对国家的重大政策，和地方的各项重要措施，提交政协委员会进行协商，充分交换意见，使各种政策措施更加完善、思想认识更趋一致，以发挥政协应有的作用。
    我们在祖国社会主义建设取得了伟大成就，社会主义革命已经基本完成，阶级关系起了根本的变化，人民民主统一战线日益巩固和扩大的形势下，让我们更加团结在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，根据“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，进一步加强团结，团结一切可以团结的力量，调动一切积极因素，为社会主义服务。（附图片）
