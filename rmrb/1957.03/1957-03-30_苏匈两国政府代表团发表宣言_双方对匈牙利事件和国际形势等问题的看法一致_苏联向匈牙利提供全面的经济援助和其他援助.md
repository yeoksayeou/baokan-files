Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 29th - The declaration issued by the Soviet and Hungarian government delegations after their talks was signed on the 28th in the Kremlin.

The declaration, signed by Bulganin and Kadar, discussed the issues addressed during the talks between the two delegations, including the counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary and the situation that followed, the current international situation, and the further development of Soviet-Hungarian relations in the economic, cultural, and other fields.

The declaration announced that this year, the Soviet Union will supply Hungary with goods totaling 1,001 million rubles and provide long-term, low-interest loans of 750 million rubles (including 200 million rubles in free foreign exchange). In addition, this year the Soviet Union will supply Hungary with 85 million rubles worth of goods and 40 million rubles in free foreign exchange under previously granted loans.

The Soviet government also agreed to grant Hungary a long-term grace period for the repayment of a previous loan of 150 million rubles and canceled Hungary's debt of more than 1 billion forints incurred in the past from receiving former German property from the Soviet Union and the Soviet share capital in former Soviet-Hungarian joint-stock companies.

Referring to the Hungarian events and the international situation, the declaration stated that the characteristic of the modern international situation is the existence of two world social systems (the socialist system and the capitalist system). The countries of the socialist camp consistently adhere to the principle of peaceful coexistence between the two systems in their foreign policies. However, the reactionary groups in the imperialist countries not only reject all proposals aimed at ensuring lasting peace but also try every possible means to aggravate the international situation, incite war hysteria, and spread distrust between countries. They attempt to bring the world back to the former state of "cold war" and, for this purpose, launched a bloody incident in Hungary.

The reliable materials and documents held by the Hungarian government prove that the armed rebellion launched by the Hungarian counter-revolutionary forces in this incident, taking advantage of the working people's demand for the rapid correction of the mistakes made by the former Hungarian leadership, was prepared under the direct leadership and active participation of the aggressive groups of Western countries. The traitor Nagy and his group bear serious responsibility for the outbreak of this rebellion. They deceptively shouted socialist slogans, tried every possible means to obliterate the socialist achievements made by the working people through selfless labor, and, under the pretext of opposing past mistakes, began to attack the dictatorship of the proletariat and the very foundations of Hungary's new socialist people's democratic system.

The Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government considers it necessary to state that, in October and November of last year, when Hungary was about to become a fascist state and the fate of the Hungarian people, the Hungarian nation, and the peace and security of Europe were about to suffer serious consequences as a result, the brotherly assistance of the Soviet Union enabled the Hungarian people to maintain their freedom and independence. The participation of the Soviet army in suppressing the fascist rioters was a noble act of proletarian solidarity.

Now, some people, in order to slander the Soviet army's mission of liberation, are attempting to distort the Soviet army's actions in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots. The Hungarian government firmly declares that this is actually helping the imperialist reactionaries and the internal counter-revolutionaries in Hungary. This attempt crudely tramples on the great principles of proletarian internationalism.

The declaration stated that the counter-revolutionary events in Hungary once again proved that, in the current situation, only the close unity of socialist countries can ensure the smooth socialist construction and the maintenance of national independence of these countries. The Hungarian events show that the people of socialist countries should maintain the highest degree of revolutionary vigilance and be good at resolutely defending the great achievements of socialist construction, preventing the encroachment of enemies at home and abroad.

The declaration continued by saying that the imperialist groups of the United States and other Western countries directly or indirectly participated in the conspiracy to overthrow the government of the Hungarian working people. This was a counter-revolutionary action aimed at the entire socialist camp. The Soviet government and the Hungarian government declare that they are still willing to cooperate peacefully with capitalist countries in the future. However, they firmly declare that they will give the most resolute counterattack to any attempts to interfere in their internal affairs and hinder their people from carrying out peaceful labor.

The two governments stated that raising and discussing the so-called Hungarian issue in the United Nations, as well as the resolutions passed by the United Nations General Assembly on this issue, seriously damaged the prestige of this organization and were a crude interference in Hungary's internal affairs, a crude interference in matters within the scope of the authority of the governments of Hungary, the Soviet Union, and other Warsaw Treaty participating countries.

Now, various institutions in many Western countries, including official authorities, are trying every possible means to prevent Hungarian refugees from returning to their country. Some people are taking advantage of the refugees' desperate situation to force them to participate in newly established reactionary émigré organizations and groups, engaging in activities against the Hungarian people's democratic system. The two governments firmly condemn this behavior.

Regarding the issue of relations between the two countries, both sides pointed out that the Soviet-Hungarian Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance signed on February 18, 1948, fully conforms to the interests of both countries. The Hungarian government stated that it fully agrees with the Soviet government's declaration of October 30 last regarding the foundations of developing and further strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

The declaration of the Soviet and Hungarian governments stated that the friendly ties between the Soviet and Hungarian peoples have deep roots. The relations between the two countries are based on complete equality and selfless brotherly friendship. Different from the "equality" of bourgeois nationalism, the basis of Soviet-Hungarian equal relations is the comprehensive concern for the welfare of the working people of the two countries, filled with the spirit of proletarian internationalism. It is precisely for the interests of the Hungarian working people, and thus also for the interests of the entire socialist camp, that the Soviet Union provides Hungary with comprehensive economic and other assistance.

The trade between the two countries, both now and in the past, has been conducted based on world prices.

The declaration continued by pointing out that, in order to facilitate Hungary's overcoming economic difficulties, the Soviet government agreed to the request made by the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government and decided to greatly increase the supply of raw materials, semi-finished products, equipment, and other goods needed by the Hungarian national economy and to meet the needs of residents this year. This year, the Soviet Union will supply Hungary with goods totaling 1,001 million rubles, including 450,000 tons of wheat, 200,000 tons of feed grains, more than 1.2 million tons of iron ore, 150,000 tons of steel, 110,000 tons of pig iron, 500,000 tons of coke, 1.2 million tons of coal, and a large number of other industrial raw materials, consumer goods, and other commodities. Among them, 250,000 tons of wheat, 150,000 tons of feed grains, and a large number of other commodities will be supplied in the first half of this year.

Considering that long-term agreements have a good effect on the planned development of the economies of the two countries, the two sides agreed to instruct their respective relevant organs to draft relevant proposals and hold negotiations this year to discuss the issue of concluding an agreement on the mutual supply of goods for 1958-1960.

In order to assist the Hungarian government in restoring and further developing the economy, so that it can not only meet the growing domestic needs but also ensure the balance of foreign trade and improve the living standards of the residents, the Soviet government granted Hungary a long-term loan of 750 million rubles for use this year. This loan has favorable terms, with an annual interest rate of 2%, and will be repaid from 1961 onwards with commodities normally exported by Hungary, to be paid off within ten years.

Hungary will supply the Soviet Union with its own goods in 1957 as repayment.

The Soviet government also agreed to consider the issue of providing economic and technical assistance for helping Hungary build and rebuild certain industrial enterprises and transportation industries and to resolve it as satisfactorily as possible. To this end, the two sides authorized their relevant organs to hold consultations this year to formulate recommendations in this regard.

The declaration announced that the two government delegations also studied and resolved all other financial account issues between the two countries on a mutually beneficial basis.

Both sides pointed out that every effort must be made to further expand scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries. The two countries will continue to participate in the research work of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in the future. The Soviet Union will provide Hungary with economic and technical assistance in uranium exploration and will supply equipment, devices, and instruments. In addition, the Soviet Union will help Hungary build a nuclear power plant and ensure the supply of fissile materials. The two sides agreed that, after Hungary arranges uranium mining, it will sell a portion of the uranium ore that is not needed by the Hungarian national economy to the Soviet Union at a fair and mutually beneficial price.

The two sides also unanimously agreed to continue to strive to develop scientific and cultural cooperation in accordance with the 1956 Soviet-Hungarian Scientific and Cultural Cooperation Agreement.

The two delegations agreed to conclude an agreement on resolving nationality issues, an agreement on providing legal assistance in civil and criminal cases, and other agreements agreed upon by both parties.

The declaration then touched on issues related to the Warsaw Treaty Organization. The two governments believe that as long as Western countries continue to expand their military, and stubbornly refuse to accept proposals on disarmament, the dissolution of military blocs, and the establishment of a European collective security system, the countries of the socialist camp should take all possible measures to ensure the protection of the achievements of their working people and to safeguard peace and security in Europe and the world. The two governments expressed their determination to support and consolidate the Warsaw Treaty.

The two governments stated that the issue of the stationing of the armed forces of the Warsaw Treaty member states is to be resolved, but not in the way that the imperialist groups and the nationalists who serve them hope, but in a way that conforms to the interests of the Hungarian working people and the people of the socialist camp countries, in accordance with their existing agreements, and is conducive to their security, and conducive to creating conditions for peaceful labor for the people of these countries.

The Hungarian government stated that, in the current international situation, the most important thing for the working people of socialist countries is to ensure the reliable protection of their socialist achievements. The stationing of Soviet troops in Hungary is the main factor in protecting Hungary from imperialist aggression.

The two sides have reached an agreement to hold negotiations in the near future on the issue of the stationing of Soviet troops in Hungary and on determining the number, composition, and location of the stationed troops, and to conclude an agreement determining the legal status of the Soviet troops temporarily stationed in Hungary.

The declaration also pointed out that the two governments unanimously condemned the remilitarization of West Germany and the revival of West German militarism and revanchist spirit. West Germany's joining the North Atlantic aggressive group and the equipping of West German armed forces with atomic weapons have created new and serious obstacles to eliminating the division of Germany and restoring German unification. The two governments believe that without the rapprochement of the two Germanys, the task of resolving German unification is inconceivable.

The Hungarian government also expressed its full agreement with the Soviet government's statement on the disarmament issue in November 1956, and it believes that the implementation of the proposals in this statement could ease international tensions, end the arms race, and eliminate the danger of a new war.

　　苏匈两国政府代表团发表宣言
　　双方对匈牙利事件和国际形势等问题的看法一致
　　苏联向匈牙利提供全面的经济援助和其他援助
    新华社莫斯科29日电  苏联和匈牙利两国政府代表团在会谈结束后发表的宣言，已经在28日在克里姆林宫签字。
    这项由布尔加宁和卡达尔签署的宣言，谈到了两国代表团在会谈中所讨论到的问题，其中包括匈牙利反革命暴乱及其后形成的局势，当前的国际形势，以及进一步发展苏匈两国经济、文化各方面的关系等问题。
    宣言宣布，今年苏联将供应匈牙利总值达十亿零一千万卢布的商品，贷予七亿五千万卢布的长期低利贷款（其中包括两亿卢布的自由外汇）。另外，今年苏联还将在以前给予的贷款项下供给匈牙利八千五百万卢布的货物和四千万卢布的自由外汇。
    苏联政府还答应匈牙利长期缓期偿还以前的一亿五千万卢布贷款，并且取消了过去匈牙利因从苏联接收前德国人产业以及前苏匈混合股份公司中苏联股本而积欠的十亿福林以上的债务。
    在谈到匈牙利事件和国际形势时，宣言说，现代国际局势的特点是存在着两个世界社会体系（社会主义体系和资本主义体系）。社会主义阵营各国在自己的外交政策中坚持不渝地执行两个体系和平共处的原则。但是，帝国主义国家反动集团不但拒绝种种旨在保证持久和平的建议，而且百般企图加剧国际局势，煽起战争狂，散布国与国之间的不信任。它们企图使世界回到从前的“冷战”状态，并且为了这个目的在匈牙利发动了流血事件。
    匈牙利政府掌握的可靠材料和文件证明：匈牙利反革命势力在这次事件中利用劳动人民要求迅速纠正匈牙利前领导所犯的错误这个机会而发动的武装暴动，是在西方国家侵略集团的直接领导下和积极参加下准备起来的。而叛徒纳吉和它的集团要对这次暴乱的爆发负严重责任，他们骗人地喊着社会主义口号，千方百计抹杀劳动人民用忘我劳动取得的社会主义成果，借口反对过去的错误而开始对无产阶级专政进攻，对匈牙利人民民主的新社会制度的基础的基础进攻。
    匈牙利工农革命政府认为有必要声明：在去年10月和11月间，当匈牙利势将变成法西斯国家，匈牙利人民、匈牙利国家的命运和欧洲的和平安全势将因此而遭到严重后果的时候，苏联的兄弟援助使匈牙利人民得以保持住他们的自由和独立。苏联军队参与镇压法西斯暴动者，是无产阶级团结的高尚行为。
    现在有些人为了诋毁苏军的解放使命，而企图歪曲苏军参加镇压反革命暴动的行动。匈牙利政府坚决声明，这实际上等于帮助帝国主义反动派和匈牙利内部的反革命。这种企图粗暴地践踏了无产阶级国际主义的伟大原则。
    宣言说，匈牙利的反革命事件再次证明：在目前的情况下，只有社会主义国家的紧密团结才能保证这些国家顺利建设社会主义和维护民族独立。匈牙利事件说明，社会主义国家的人民应该保持最高度的革命警惕性，并且要善于坚决保卫社会主义建设的伟大成果，防止内外敌人的侵害。
    宣言接着说，美国等西方国家帝国主义集团直接或间接地参加推翻匈牙利劳动人民政权的阴谋活动，这是矛头对着整个社会主义阵营的反革命行动。苏联政府和匈牙利政府声明，它们今后仍然愿意同资本主义国家和平合作。可是，它们坚决声明，它们对干涉它们内政和妨碍它们人民进行和平劳动的任何企图，将给予最坚决的反击。
    两国政府声明，在联合国提出和讨论所谓匈牙利问题，以及联合国大会就这个问题通过决议，都严重地破坏这个组织的威信，并且是粗暴地干涉匈牙利内政，粗暴地干预匈牙利、苏联等华沙条约参与国政府权限范围内的问题。
    现在，许多西方国家的形形色色的机构，其中包括官方的权力机关正在千方百计地阻挠匈牙利难民回国。有人在利用难民走投无路的处境，强迫他们参加新建的反动侨民组织和集团，从事反对匈牙利人民民主制度的活动。两国政府坚决谴责这种行为。
    在谈到两国关系的问题时，双方指出，1948年2月18日签订的苏匈友好合作互助条约完全符合两国的利益。匈牙利政府声明，它完全同意苏联政府去年10月30日发表的关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言。
    苏匈两国政府的宣言说，苏匈两国人民的友好联系有着深远的根源。两国之间的关系是建立在完全平等和大公无私的兄弟友谊的基础上的。同资产阶级民族主义的“平等”不同，苏匈平等关系的基础是充满无产阶级国际主义精神的、对两国劳动人民的福利的全面关怀。正是为了匈牙利劳动人民的利益，从而也是为了整个社会主义阵营的利益，苏联才向匈牙利提供全面的经济援助和其他援助。
    两国的贸易无论是现在或是从前都是根据世界价格进行的。
    宣言接着指出，为了便利匈牙利克服经济困难，苏联政府答应匈牙利工农革命政府提出的请求，决定在今年大大增加苏联供给的原料、半制成品、设备以及匈牙利国民经济所需的和满足居民需求的其他商品的供应量。今年苏联将供应匈牙利总值为十亿零一千万卢布的商品，其中包括四十五万吨小麦，二十万吨饲料谷物，一百二十多万吨铁矿砂，十五万吨钢材，十一万吨生铁，五十万吨焦炭，一百二十万吨煤，以及大量其他工业原料、消费品和其他商品。其中二十五万吨小麦，十五万吨饲料谷物和大量其他商品将在今年上半年供应。
    考虑到长期协定对有计划地发展两国经济具有良好的作用，双方商定责成各自的有关机关草拟有关的建议，并且在今年举行谈判，讨论缔结1958—1960年相互供应商品的协定的问题。
    为了协助匈牙利政府恢复和进一步发展经济，使它不仅能满足国内日益增长的需要，而且能保障对外贸易上的平衡和提高居民生活水平，苏联政府贷给匈牙利一笔达七亿五千万卢布的长期贷款以供今年使用。这笔贷款条件优惠，年利为2％，从1961年起用匈牙利通常出口的商品来偿还，十年内还清。
    匈牙利在1957年将以自己的货物供应苏联作为偿付。
    苏联政府还同意考虑为帮助匈牙利建设和改建某些工业企业和交通运输业而提供经济和技术援助的问题，并且尽可能给予圆满的解决。为此，双方授权自己的有关机关在今年进行商谈，拟定这方面的建议。
    宣言宣布，两国政府代表团还在互利基础上研究和解决了两国之间其他一切财政帐目方面的问题。
    双方指出，必须尽一切力量进一步扩大两国之间的科学技术合作。两国今后将继续参加联合原子核研究所的研究工作，苏联将在勘探铀矿方面给予匈牙利经济上和技术上的帮助，并且供给设备、装置和仪器。此外，苏联还将帮助匈牙利建设原子能发电站，保障裂变物质的供应。双方商定，匈牙利在安排铀矿开采以后，将把匈牙利国民经济所不需要的一部分铀矿以公平互利的价格卖给苏联。
    双方还一致同意，根据1956年苏匈科学和文化合作协定继续尽力发展科学和文化的合作。
    双方代表团同意缔结一项解决国籍问题的协定，一项关于就民事和刑事案件给予法律上的帮助的协定，以及其他一些双方协议缔结的协定。
    宣言接着谈到了同华沙条约组织有关的问题。两国政府认为，只要西方国家还在扩充军备，还顽固地拒绝接受关于裁军、解散军事集团和建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议，社会主义阵营国家就应该采取一切可能的措施来保证维护本国劳动人民的成果，来维护欧洲和世界的和平与安全。两国政府表示决心支持和巩固华沙条约。
    两国政府声明，华沙条约成员国武装部队的驻扎问题是要解决的，不过不是像帝国主义集团和为他们效力的民族主义分子所希望的那样，而是要解决得符合匈牙利劳动人民和社会主义阵营各国人民的利益，要根据他们之间现存的协议，要有利于他们的安全，有利于为这些国家的人民造成和平劳动的条件。
    匈牙利政府声明，在目前的国际局势下，对社会主义国家劳动人民说来，最主要的是保证做到可靠地保卫他们的社会主义成果。苏联军队驻扎在匈牙利境内，这是保障匈牙利不受帝国主义者侵略的主要因素。
    双方已经达成协议，要在不久的将来就苏联军队驻扎在匈牙利境内的问题和关于确定驻扎部队的人数、编制、驻地问题举行谈判，并且缔结一项确定暂时驻扎在匈牙利境内的苏联军队的法律地位的协定。
    宣言还指出，两国政府一致谴责西德的重新军国主义化和西德军国主义和复仇主义精神的复活。西德加入北大西洋侵略集团和西德武装部队配备以原子武器，给消除德国的分裂和恢复德国的统一造成了新的严重障碍。两国政府认为，没有两个德国的接近，要解决德国统一的任务是不可设想的。
    匈牙利政府还表示完全同意苏联政府1956年11月关于裁军问题的声明，它认为，实现这个声明中的建议就能够缓和国际紧张局势，终止军备竞赛和消除新战争的危险。
