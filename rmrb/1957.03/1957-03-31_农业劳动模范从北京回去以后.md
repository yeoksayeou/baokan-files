　　Guo Yu'en the Day He Returned to the Cooperative
　　This Newspaper reports: Guo Yu'en attended the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference. On the morning of March 10th, as soon as he returned to the May First Agricultural Cooperative, he held a meeting with the main cooperative cadres to study the problems in the cooperative. In the afternoon, he went deep into the fields to carry stones and prepare fertilizer with the cooperative members. In this half-day of labor, he discovered that the production team was large, there were many laborers, and the work was chaotic. He also saw that they were only engaged in basic construction, neglecting land processing, and that cooperative members were unwilling to feed sows. At the same time, he accepted some suggestions from the cooperative members. After analysis and research, that night he convened a meeting of the management committee and team leaders. He first conveyed the spirit of the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference and introduced Song Bao'en's pig-raising experience, the advanced experience of Shaanxi Province's wheat yield of 1,100 jin per mu, and Yunnan Province's corn yield of 1,500 jin per mu. Then he analyzed the situation of the entire cooperative and identified existing problems. The solution was: to establish work groups according to the team, establish individual responsibility plots, and properly arrange production. Cooperative members were afraid that they would not be able to sell piglets and adult pigs. He immediately urged the supply and marketing cooperative to sign sales contracts with pig farmers, thereby resolving ideological concerns. In addition, he mobilized the masses to uncover six potentials for increased production and formulated annual target indicators for the entire cooperative. Now the cooperative members' enthusiasm for production is very high, and they are carrying out preparatory work for a bumper harvest, such as repairing beaches, building embankments, leveling land, and accumulating fertilizer.

　　Red Star Cooperative to Increase Soybean Production This Year
　　Yang Baokun, the representative of Liaoning Province attending the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference, launched the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in Changtu County, which he leads, to formulate a soybean bumper harvest plan for this year after returning to the cooperative from Beijing.
　　A few days ago, Yang Baokun wrote to the editorial department of this newspaper, saying that because their "Red Star Agricultural Cooperative has achieved increased production by planting 'Keyuan No. 1' soybeans for several years. According to the discussion at the cooperative members' representative meeting on March 15, it was decided that the soybean planting area this year will be 900 hectares, which is 16.58% more than in 1956; it is planned that the average yield per hectare will be 4,200 jin, which is also 32.3% higher than the average yield in 1956. And cultivate 5.3 hectares of high-yield fields with a yield of 8,000 to 10,000 jin per hectare. At the same time, summarize the experience of bumper harvests in 1956 and determine this year's measures and technical requirements for increased production. All cooperative member representatives are full of confidence and strive to achieve another bumper harvest this year."
　　Learn from Advanced Experience to Strengthen Confidence in Increased Production
　　This Newspaper reports: Huang Qigui, the director of the Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative in Wannian County, Jiangxi Province, who attended the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference, was warmly welcomed by the cooperative members upon returning to the cooperative from Beijing. Huang Qigui accepted the cooperative members' requests and held eight cooperative member meetings in the more concentrated residential areas, with more than 3,000 men and women cooperative members participating. He conveyed the important reports at the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference, as well as many advanced national production experiences, and also introduced the National Agricultural Exhibition. Therefore, the vast number of cooperative members have a clearer understanding of the great significance of striving for a bumper agricultural harvest this year. Huang Hegui, the first group leader of the Dahuang Village Production Team, said: "Our cooperative has been in operation for five years and has increased production for five years, with an average of 360 jin per mu. Some cooperative members believe that production has reached its peak. However, the labor model conveyed that the average yield per mu of the Dabo Agricultural Cooperative in Qiongdong County, Hainan Island, is more than 2,500 jin, which is less than the remainder of their production. We must work harder to catch up." Since then, the cooperative members' confidence in completing this year's production increase task has been strengthened, and they have decided to increase production by another 8.2% on the basis of last year's bumper harvest. In order to overfulfill this production increase task, the cooperative members saw that the cooperative lacked production funds, so they actively sought ways to invest. The cooperative members invested more than 500 jin of scrap iron and more than 150 pieces of wood. More than 100 households in the entire cooperative also deposited 2,350 yuan into the credit cooperative, which effectively solved the specific problems of preparing for cultivation. (Xu Jialin)
　　New Joy
　　Liu Lian
　　The clear Mulan Creek flows through the Xianyou Plain in coastal Fujian. Lin Jinyong, who created the highest national sugarcane production record, lives in Xianyou County.
　　In early March, it was the sugarcane harvest season. I walked through the dense sugarcane forest that blocked the view, bypassed several manual sugar mills that exuded a rich aroma of sugar juice, and came to a sugarcane field, where I saw Lin Jinyong harvesting the "Taiwan Sugar 134" improved sugarcane variety that he had carefully cultivated for several years. This director of the agricultural cooperative enthusiastically invited me to his home. A kind of uncontrollable excitement constantly appeared on his face. It turned out that their cooperative had another bumper harvest of sugarcane. He said: "The 200 mu of sugarcane planted by our Jianhua Agricultural Cooperative last year have now harvested 108 mu, with an average yield of 19,772 jin per mu. The 7.6 mu of high-yield fields first harvested the relatively poor 2.6 mu, which yielded 67,433 jin." After I calculated it, each mu of high-yield field harvested more than 25,930 jin, which has exceeded their target of creating a 25,000 jin high-yield record set last year; and the average yield of the 108 mu of sugarcane already harvested by the Jianhua Cooperative has increased by another 26% compared with the national record of 15,600 jin per mu of sugarcane field created by Lin Jinyong's mutual aid group in 1955. The members of the Jianhua Cooperative poured their heart and soul into creating this new record, so it is no wonder that Lin Jinyong is expressing his heartfelt joy.
　　When I visited Lin Jinyong, it happened to be a few days after he returned from Beijing to attend the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference. With the greatest joy in his life, he described to me the grand banquet and grand awards he received from the national leaders in Beijing. In these days, in addition to being busy conveying the information to farmers in various places, he is also rushing to lead his 463 cooperative members to formulate this year's sugarcane production increase plan. It has been initially determined that they will create 50 mu of high-yield fields with a yield of 30,000 jin of sugarcane per mu, and the average yield of the remaining 750 mu of sugarcane fields is required to reach 20,000 jin.

　　农业劳动模范从北京回去以后
　  郭玉恩回社头一天
    本报讯  郭玉恩出席了全国农业劳动模范代表会议，3月10日上午一回到五一农业社，就开了个主要社干接头会，研究社里的问题，下午就深入田间和社员一块抬石头、熏荒肥。他在这半天的劳动中，发现了生产队大、劳力多、做活乱；还看到了光搞基本建设，忽视土地加工和社员不愿喂母猪的现象。同时他接受了社员提的一些意见。经过分析研究，当天黑夜就召开了管理委员会和队长干部会议。他首先传达了全国农业劳动模范代表会议精神，并介绍了宋保恩的养猪、陕西省小麦亩产一千一百斤、云南省玉米亩产一千五百斤的先进经验等。然后分析了全社情况，找出了现有问题。想出解决办法是：按队成立作业小组，建立个人责任地，适当安排生产。社员怕推销不了小猪和成猪，他即督促供销社立即同养猪户签订推销合同，从而解决了思想顾虑。此外，还发动群众挖出了六项增产潜力，制订了全社全年任务指标。现在社员生产劲头十分高涨，正为大丰收进行着修滩、垒岸、整地、积肥等备耕工作。（郭秀山）
　　红星社今年要多增产大豆
    出席全国农业劳动模范代表会议的辽宁省代表杨宝坤，由北京回社以后就发动了他领导的昌图县红星农业生产社制定今年的大豆丰产计划。
    几天前，杨宝坤给本报编辑部来信说，因为他们的“红星农业社几年来种植‘克元一号’大豆都得到了增产。根据3月15日社员代表大会的讨论，确定今年大豆种植面积九百垧，这比1956年增加16.58％；计划每垧平均产量四千二百斤，这也比1956年平均产量提高32.3％。并培植五点三垧，每垧产量达到八千到一万斤的高产田。同时，总结1956年丰产经验，确定了今年的增产措施和技术要求。全体社员代表们都满怀着信心，争取今年再一次获得大丰收。”
    学习先进经验加强增产信心
    本报讯  江西万年县参加全国农业劳动模范代表会议的金星农业社主任黄奇贵从北京回社，受到广大社员热烈的欢迎。黄奇贵接受社员们的要求，巡回在居住较集中的地点召开了八个社员大会，计有三千多男女社员参加，传达了全国农业劳动模范代表会议上的重要报告，以及全国许多先进生产经验，还介绍了全国农业展览会。因此广大社员对争取今年农业大丰收的重大意义，有了更明确的认识。大黄村生产队第一组长黄和贵说：“我们社办了五年就增了五年产，每亩平均三百六十斤。有些社员认为增产到了顶。但是劳动模范传达的海南岛琼东县大保农业社，每亩平均产量有二千五百多斤，比起来我们还不如他社零数多。我们更要加倍努力赶上去。”从此，社员们对完成今年增产任务的信心增强了，决定在去年丰产基础上，再增产8.2％。为了超额完成这一增产任务，社员们看到社里缺少生产资金，就积极想办法，纷纷投资。全社社员新投资废铁五百余斤、木料一百五十余根。全社还有一百多户把二千三百五十元存入信用社，有力地解决了备耕的具体问题。  （徐家琳）
　　新的喜悦
　  刘镰
    清清的木兰溪穿流在福建近海的仙游平原上，创造全国甘蔗丰产最高纪录的林金涌就住在仙游县。
    3月初，正是甘蔗收获的季节。我穿过重重蔽人视线的蔗林，绕过几座散发出糖汁浓香的手工榨糖厂，走到一块蔗园里，正见林金涌在收获他几年来精心栽培的“台糖134”良种蔗。这位农业社主任，热情地邀我到他的家里。一种抑制不住的兴奋不时从他的面部浮现出来，原来他们社的甘蔗又丰收了。他说：“我们建华农业社去年种的二百亩甘蔗，现在已经收获了一百零八亩，平均每亩产一万九千七百七十二斤。七点六亩丰产田先收了较差的二点六亩，计收了六万七千四百三十三斤。”我听完一合算，每亩丰产田合收二万五千九百三十多斤，已经超过了他们去年订的创造二万五千斤丰产纪录的指标；而建华社已收获的一百零八亩甘蔗的平均产量，又比林金涌互助组1955年创造的每亩蔗田平均产一万五千六百斤的全国最高纪录，再提高了二成六。建华社的社员们用心血浇成了这一个新纪录，难怪林金涌要发出由衷的喜悦了。
    我去访问林金涌的时候，适逢他从北京参加全国农业劳动模范代表会议回来不几天。他以生平最大的喜悦向我叙述了在北京受到国家领导人员盛情欢宴和隆重奖励的景况。这几天，他除了忙着向各地农民作传达之外，又赶着领导他的四百六十三户社员制订今年的甘蔗增产计划。初步已经确定：要创造五十亩每亩产三万斤蔗的丰产田，其余七百五十亩蔗田平均产量要求达到二万斤。
