    Further Enhancing the Organizational Role of Local CPPCCs
    Chen Guangzao Introduces the Work and Achievements of the Ya'an CPPCC

    I fully endorse Chairman Mao's important speech at the Supreme State Conference on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, as well as Premier Zhou's and Vice Premier Li's reports. I also agree with the report of the Standing Committee. I will bring the spirit of this meeting back with me and, in my future work, will do everything in my power to implement and realize it.

    A few days ago, I attended the Supreme State Conference as a non-voting delegate, and now I am attending the Third Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC, which makes me feel extremely excited and honored. To be born in the great era of Chairman Mao is truly glorious and blessed! Although Ya'an is a relatively remote city, in the past few years, especially in the past year, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, and through continuous efforts, we, like all parts of the country, have experienced a profound and historically significant transformation. We have achieved a decisive victory in the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. We have also made certain achievements in other areas. Forty-five advanced agricultural cooperatives have now been established. The number of peasant households joining cooperatives accounts for 92% of the total number of peasant households. According to a survey of the First Advanced Cooperative, the average annual income of each member of the cooperative is about 80 yuan, an increase of about 30% compared to 1955. After the overall public-private partnership of private industry and commerce, 94% have completed enterprise restructuring and personnel arrangements. The number of people organized in handicrafts accounts for 97% of the total number of people, and the total output value and labor productivity have greatly improved. We are in an era where thousands of troops and horses are rushing towards socialism, everything is for socialism, how can we not be excited and encouraged! Although I am nearly seventy years old, I feel that I am getting younger and younger, and my life is becoming more and more meaningful. I often think: I am not old yet, I want to dedicate the energy of the second half of my life to the people, and do whatever I can, contribute a tile and a stone to the socialist temple. We social figures must not harbor any negative emotions of decline and pessimism such as "the sunset is infinitely good, but it is near dusk." As long as we recognize the greatness of the era and its relationship with the individual, then we can transform the "dusk thought" into strength, be enthusiastic and active, and willingly contribute a tile and a stone to socialism.

    Secondly, I would like to talk about the organizational role of local CPPCCs. I believe that better playing the organizational role of local CPPCCs is of great benefit to local socialist transformation and construction. For example, since the establishment of the Ya'an Municipal CPPCC, although the time has been short for a few months, it has indeed played a certain role. In August of last year, after the overall public-private partnership of private industry and commerce, before the restructuring of enterprises and personnel arrangements, the general industrialists and businessmen were very anxious, and there were many opinions and problems. After we understood this, we held a large symposium through the industry and commerce work group, absorbed the opinions of the masses, and promptly reflected and made suggestions to the Party, government, and relevant authorities, so that the existing problems were resolved satisfactorily, and assisted the Party and the government in implementing the transformation of private enterprises. At the same time, it also stimulated the enthusiasm of people in industry and commerce.

    For example, in October last year, the supply of pork in our city was slightly tight, and the catering industry took the opportunity to cultivate the capitalist management style of reducing quality and quantity and seeking exorbitant profits, which was generally reflected very badly. After understanding this, I immediately invited relevant units to form a visiting working group to conduct in-depth visits to various households. Through visits, inspections, publicity and education were carried out, so that it was overcome and corrected in a timely manner, which made the people feel satisfied. In addition, an elderly people's forum was held, and they reflected that "in the past, we had no suitable place to speak, but now the CPPCC cares about us and we have a place to speak." Organizing learning has also played a great role in transforming burdens into wealth, turning negativity into positivity, and promoting the self-ideological transformation of people from all walks of life. We should deeply study the United Front policy and guidelines, study the work of the CPPCC, and strive to further enhance the organizational role of local CPPCCs.

    I am not good at speaking, please correct me if there is anything wrong. Finally, I congratulate the victory of the conference! I wish everyone good health!

    进一步发挥地方政协的组织作用
    陈光藻介绍雅安政协的工作和成绩
    我完全拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的重要讲话和周总理、李副总理的报告，同意常务委员会工作报告。并将大会的精神带回去，在今后工作中尽一切力量加以贯彻和实现。
    前几天列席了最高国务会议，现又列席了全国政协全国二届三次会议，我衷心感到万分兴奋和荣幸。生在伟大的毛主席时代真是又光荣又幸福！雅安虽是一个较偏僻的城市，可是几年来，特别是近一年来，在党和政府正确的领导下，经过不断的努力，我们也和全国各地一样，经历了一个具有深刻历史意义的变化。对农业、手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造，取得了决定性的胜利。其他方面也获得了一定成就。农业现在已成立四十五个高级社。入社农户占总农户的92％，据第一高级社的调查，本社平均每个社员全年收入约为八十多元，较1955年增加了30％左右；私营工商业全行业公私合营后，已有94％完成了企业改组和人事安排；手工业组织起来的人数占总人数的97％，生产总值和劳动生产率都有很大的提高。我们处在这千军万马奔向社会主义，一切为了社会主义的时代，怎叫人不兴奋和鼓舞！虽然我已经年近七旬，但我觉得我越活越年轻，越活越有意义，我常常在想：我还算不得老，我要将我后半生的精力贡献给人民，能够做啥，就尽量的去做啥，为社会主义的庙堂，我愿为一瓦一石。我们社会人士绝不能存一点“夕阳无限好，只是近黄昏”颓丧悲观的消极情绪，只要我们认清了时代的伟大和与个人的关系，那么我们就可化“黄昏思想”为力量，热情积极，心甘情愿地为社会主义作一瓦一石了。
    其次，我想谈一下地方政协的组织作用，我认为更好的去发挥地方政协的组织作用，对于地方社会主义改造和建设事业有很大的益处。比如我们雅安市政协成立以来，几个月时间虽短，的确也起了一定的作用。去年8月间，私营工商业全行业公私合营后，企业改组，人事安排前，一般工商业者七上八下，意见和问题很多，我们了解后，通过工商工作组召开了一次大型的座谈会，吸收群众的意见，及时向党政和机关作了反映和建议，使存在的问题得到圆满的解决，协助了党和政府贯彻了对私改造。同时还激发工商界人士的经营积极性。
    又如去年10月间我市猪肉供应稍有点紧张，饮食行业，就借此滋长减质减量、贪图暴利的资本主义经营作风，一般反映很坏。我会了解后赓即邀请有关单位，组成访问工作组，深入各户访问，通过访问进行检查和宣传教育，这样才及时地得到克服和纠正，使人民感到满意。另外还召开过一次老人座谈会，他们反映说，“过去我们有话莫适合的地方说，现在政协联系关怀我们，有地方可以说话了”。组织学习，对化包袱为财富，化消极为积极，促进各界人士自我思想改造的作用也是很大的。我们应该深入学习统战政策方针，钻研政协工作，为进一步发挥地方政协的组织作用而奋斗。
    我不会讲话，有不对的地方请大家指正。最后祝贺大会胜利！各位健康！
