After visiting the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the delegation will continue its visit to China.

Also at the airport to see them off were Wei Guoqing, Governor of Guangxi Province, Xiao Yizhou, Secretary of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Tan Yingji, Vice Governor and Governor of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, and others.

The Ambassador of the Czechoslovak Republic to China, Gregor, was also at the airport to see them off.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 17th: Premier Viliam Široký and the Czechoslovak government delegation he led arrived in Hanoi by plane at noon today.

Premier Pham Van Dong, Deputy Premiers Phan Ke Toai and Vo Nguyen Giap, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Ton Duc Thang, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, Truong Chinh, and representatives of various parties and people's organizations in Vietnam, totaling more than 5,000 people, welcomed the distinguished guests at the airport.

In his welcoming speech at the airport, Premier Pham Van Dong said that the people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Czechoslovakia have long been closely united in the socialist family. The visit of the Czechoslovak government delegation to Vietnam will have a significant impact on further consolidating the friendship and cooperation between the two countries, promoting the unity of socialist countries, and safeguarding world peace.

In his reply, Premier Široký conveyed the congratulations of the Czechoslovak people to the heroic Vietnamese people.

Premier Široký then condemned the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to undermine the Geneva Accords and obstruct the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. He expressed his belief that the Vietnamese people, with the support of peace-loving people around the world, will surely be able to crush all the conspiracies of imperialism.

Premier Široký expressed the hope that the visit of the Czechoslovak government delegation to Vietnam would contribute to further consolidating and developing the fraternal relations between the two countries.

Premier Široký and the Czechoslovak government delegation he led were greeted by more than 20,000 citizens lining the streets as they entered the city of Hanoi accompanied by Premier Pham Van Dong and others.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 17th: Seventy thousand citizens of Hanoi held a grand rally in Ba Dinh Square this afternoon to welcome Premier Široký and the Czechoslovak government delegation he led.

At 4:20 p.m., Vietnamese government leaders, headed by Premier Pham Van Dong, accompanied the distinguished guests from Czechoslovakia onto the rostrum, eliciting enthusiastic cheers from the entire audience.

Tran Duy Hung, Chairman of the Hanoi Municipal Administrative Committee, in his speech, extended a warm welcome to the distinguished guests who had come from afar on behalf of the people of the Vietnamese capital.

Premier Pham Van Dong then spoke at the rally, expressing his gratitude to the Czechoslovak people for their generous and selfless assistance to the Vietnamese people.

Pham Van Dong then spoke about the importance of strengthening the unity and friendship among socialist countries. He said that in the current international situation, it is necessary to strengthen the iron-like unity of the socialist camp and the unity and friendship between peace-loving countries in the world to repel the provocative forces of imperialism.

Pham Van Dong reiterated that the Vietnamese people fully support the just struggles of the people of Hungary, Egypt, and the Arab countries, and condemned the United States for continuing to create world tension, threatening the peace of Vietnam, and interfering in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries. He expressed his support for the proposal put forward by the People's Republic of China to demand the dissolution of aggressive military blocs and the signing of a treaty guaranteeing the security of all countries in Asia and the Pacific region.

Pham Van Dong also strongly condemned the conspiracy of imperialist countries to permanently divide Vietnam and drag South Vietnam into the United Nations, and demanded that all countries related to the Geneva Accords guarantee that they assume their obligations under the agreement.

Premier Široký then spoke at the rally. He said that the Czechoslovak people are very concerned about the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people for the construction of a socialist future, and believe that the Vietnamese people, who won victory in the war of resistance, will surely be able to win victory in the struggle to build their motherland.

Široký accused the imperialist countries, headed by the United States, of undermining the peaceful reunification of Vietnam and carrying out subversive activities in Hungary. Široký emphasized that the imperialist forces can neither thwart the national liberation movement in Asia and Africa, nor weaken the unity and strength of the socialist camp. On the contrary, the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, has become more united and stronger than ever before.

This evening, Premier Pham Van Dong hosted a banquet at the Presidential Palace in honor of the Czechoslovak government delegation.
