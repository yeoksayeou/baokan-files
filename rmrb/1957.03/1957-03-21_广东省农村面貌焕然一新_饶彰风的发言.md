Rao Zhangfeng's Speech

I wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference and Premier Zhou's political report, and I fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the CPPCC. Now I would like to express a few opinions on the work in the rural areas of Guangdong:

Farmers Say Rural Areas Have Undergone Eight Transformations After Cooperativization; Income Can Exceed That of Upper-Middle Peasants Within a Few Years

(1) Guangdong is a rich province, evergreen with many avenues for production; but it is also adjacent to Hong Kong and Macau, has the longest coastline, and the most overseas Chinese. Furthermore, it was among the earliest to come into contact with imperialism. Its economic development has clear colonial characteristics. Therefore, Guangdong is not only rich in revolutionary spirit, but also deeply and widely influenced by capitalism. The struggle between ourselves and the enemy is extremely sharp, making it a very complex place. Since liberation, Guangdong Province has faced relatively large resistance in carrying out land reform, the Three-Anti Campaign, democratic reforms, and ideological remolding, especially the three major socialist transformations last year. Comrades working in Guangdong have this understanding: we must be very brave and firm, and also particularly cautious and careful. In the past seven years, Guangdong has had many shortcomings and errors in its work, but under the correct leadership of the Central Committee, and thanks to the efforts of the people of the whole province, it has indeed done a lot of work and achieved great results, especially in completing agricultural cooperativization last year. This has not only put the province's farmers on the road to collective prosperity, but has also powerfully promoted the realization of the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce, enabling Guangdong, along with the rest of the country, to defeat capitalism and embark on the broad road of socialism.

Once the newborn socialist agricultural economy was born, it displayed great vitality and unparalleled superiority. Last year, Guangdong suffered considerable natural disasters, with about one-sixth of the paddy fields experiencing varying degrees of drought. The newly established cooperatives had meager resources and lacked experience in management. However, relying on the superior conditions of the cooperatives and the hard work of all members, the province's agricultural production achieved a huge bumper harvest, with grain production increasing by 2.1 billion jin, the largest increase since liberation. More than 70% of the cooperatives in the province increased production, and more than 75% of the members increased their income. The number of counties with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu increased from the original three (Chao'an, Chenghai, Chaoyang) to six (adding Puning, Jieyang, and Nan'ao). The number of cooperatives with a yield of 1,000 jin increased from the original 850 to 3,670. More than 1,000 cooperatives in the province reached the average income level of upper-middle peasants, with some cooperatives reaching a distribution value of more than 3.13 yuan per labor day (such as the Nanzhou Cooperative in Machong, Dongguan). Within a year, more than 21 million farmers in Guangdong received varying degrees of increased income, which is unprecedented in Guangdong's history. Farmers in Dongjiang say:

“After cooperativization, there are eight changes in the countryside: barren land turns into fertile land, wasteland turns into good land, dry land turns into paddy field, grain shortage turns into surplus grain, poor villages turn into rich villages, poor people turn into rich people, lazy people turn into labor models, and wild children turn into students.” This is a vivid summary of the superiority of cooperativization by the farmers.

But why are there still people with reduced income, and some wanting to withdraw from the cooperatives? How do you explain this? Last year, about 15% of farming households in Guangdong did experience reduced income, and a brief period after the autumn harvest saw approximately 60,000 households wanting to withdraw from the cooperatives in some areas. But who were those with reduced incomes? First of all, the upper-middle peasants. In most rural areas of Guangdong, upper-middle peasants account for about 9% of the total number of farming households, and in cash crop areas, they account for 15%-20%. Their previous income levels were relatively high. After joining the cooperatives, only individual labor skills mattered, so a considerable number of upper-middle peasants experienced reduced income. Secondly, Guangdong has a relatively developed commodity economy, and many part-time small traders and handicraftsmen were brought into the cooperatives. They lost their part-time income, and only had agricultural income, so some people also experienced reduced income. There were also farming households with a lot of land and little labor, and the elimination of land dividends also reduced their income somewhat. Of course, many households with reduced income were also caused by severe natural disasters and our failure to do our work well. However, for the above-mentioned farming households, even if there were no shortcomings in the work, it would be difficult to ensure that every household would increase its income in the first year of running the cooperatives under the best circumstances. However, it is certain that the situation will improve year by year, and within a few years, they will definitely catch up with and exceed the average income level of upper-middle peasants. This is something that even some cooperative members who are agitating to withdraw are very clear about. Therefore, after some educational work, the cooperative members who were agitating to withdraw have generally stabilized, and more than 20,000 of the 60,000 households that had withdrawn have returned to the cooperatives.

Of course, the newly established cooperatives inevitably have some shortcomings, mainly due to the short time and lack of experience. We believe that with the efforts of the members and cadres, and the care of all parties, these shortcomings can certainly be overcome.

The Policy of Emphasizing Grain Production Has Yielded Great Results; Strive to Increase Per-Unit Area Yield to Achieve a Bumper Harvest

(2) Guangdong proposed the policy of focusing on agriculture as early as after the end of the land reform. Under this general policy, it also proposed focusing on increasing grain production in agricultural production, while actively developing cash crops, carrying out diversified operations, and comprehensively developing the agricultural economy. This is entirely in line with the actual situation in Guangdong and has been approved by the Central Committee. Practice has proven that this policy is entirely correct. However, some people say: "Guangdong does not emphasize developing industry as the key point, and does not emphasize developing cash crops in agriculture, which ignores the characteristics of Guangdong and is not a practice that suits local conditions." Is this statement correct? It is not correct. What the people of Guangdong are most concerned about is first of all the problem of having enough to eat, and they do not want to see Guangdong continue to become a market for exporting cheap raw materials and importing "foreign rice" to imperialism. The great famine in 1943, which starved more than one million people to death, is a fresh and extremely painful lesson for the people of Guangdong. Today, Guangdong has changed from a grain-deficient province to a grain-surplus province. Since 1952, it has been able to transfer an average of about 400 million jin of grain out of the province each year; at the same time, it has developed various cash crops and diversified operations, which not only ensures that farmers can eat their fill and lays a solid foundation for gradually increasing farmers' income, but also provides grain and industrial raw materials for the country's socialist construction. The people of Guangdong are very happy that they can add a useful cornerstone to China's industrialization edifice.

Of course, Guangdong has also had shortcomings and errors in implementing the agricultural production policy. At the beginning of the first half of last year, there was a period of certain subjective, one-sided, and impetuous emotions, mainly due to overemphasizing grain production and not emphasizing diversified operations enough. At the same time, in some areas where conditions were not yet in place, technical reforms were promoted too early and too hastily, causing some losses. These shortcomings and errors were corrected after April last year.

It is precisely because Guangdong has implemented the correct agricultural production policy that the achievements in agricultural production last year are very great:

Last year, the total output of grain (including miscellaneous grains) in the province reached 24 billion jin, an increase of 2.1 billion jin over the previous year, an increase of 9.8%, an increase of 50% compared to 1949, and an increase of 40% compared to the highest year before liberation (1936).

Although the production of cash crops was not tightly grasped in the first half of last year, and individual projects such as silkworm cocoons were reduced and ramie did not complete its task, the total output value still increased by 11% compared to the previous year. In particular, the increase in sugar cane was quite rapid, which enabled the sugar industry to develop rapidly. Last year, the province produced more than 400,000 tons of sugar, an increase of 12% compared to the previous year, an increase of 4.2 times compared to 1949, and a doubling compared to the highest output before liberation (1936). Last year, the amount of sugar transferred out of the province increased to 250,000 tons, while in 1952, Guangdong only transferred 120,000 tons of sugar.

In terms of animal husbandry: the quantity has decreased since the implementation of unified purchase and sale, but it has shown a significant recovery since the second half of last year. For example, the number of sows was only 300,000 at the beginning of the year, but it has increased to 600,000 by the end of the year. The number of slaughtered meat pigs reached 4.95 million dan, close to the highest output of 5.19 million dan in 1954. The development of chickens, ducks, etc. is even faster, especially ducks have increased greatly compared to previous years. For example, Xinhui County raised 400,000 ducks in 1955, and developed to 1.7 million last year, an increase of more than threefold. At present, except for the supply of pork, which is still lagging behind demand, the source of other poultry such as chickens and ducks is now sufficient, and the supply of beef and pond fish is also quite abundant.

In terms of forestry: more than 5 million mu of forest were planted last year, exceeding the plan by 7%, and the survival rate reached 70%, which is the fastest development and the greatest achievement in recent years.

In terms of fisheries: 520,000 tons in 1955, 530,000 tons in 1956, and only 290,000 tons in 1952.

In terms of sideline production: the total output value was 410 million yuan in 1955 and 490 million yuan last year, an increase of 20% compared to 1955. In short, the achievements made on all fronts of agricultural production last year are very great, and this achievement is precisely the result of the victory of agricultural cooperativization.

Some people say: "Grain has increased, but cash crops have decreased." What is the actual situation? The total area of cash crops in Guangdong is expanding year by year. In particular, the planting area of sugar cane, oil crops, tobacco, and hemp reached 6 million mu last year, an increase of more than 40% compared to 1952. It is just that the implementation of the production policy was not comprehensive enough in the first half of last year, and some scattered cash crops were squeezed out in some areas. This situation has been corrected since the second half of last year, and some are being corrected. Taking four cash crops, namely sugar cane, yellow jute, ramie, and citrus, as examples, the sugar industry in Guangdong has developed so rapidly in recent years, and the supply within the province and the transfer out of the province were so large last year (sugar production accounted for almost half of the country's total output), which would not have been possible without the development and increase in production of sugar cane. The output of yellow jute was 730,000 dan in 1955, and increased to 980,000 dan in 1956. Last year, in addition to our own use, the transfer out of the province also increased to 148,000 dan (only 98,000 dan in 1955). In 1953, only 5,500 mu of ramie were planted in the province, and last year it reached 70,000 mu. Citrus is also developing year by year. Last year, the Chaozhou citrus also increased in production. If it is said that it was not easy to buy Chaozhou citrus in Guangzhou in the previous year in order to ensure exports, last year it was not only ensured exports, but Chaozhou citrus could be bought everywhere in Guangzhou, and could be sold until April this year. It is true that nearly 10,000 mu of citrus trees were cut down in Guangdong Province last year, because several thousand mu of old trees that need to be replaced every year must be cut down. At the same time, the yellow dragon disease was very serious last year, and several thousand mu were also cut down to prevent the spread of the disease. Among them, a very small number were cut down by farmers who were unwilling to value the citrus trees and join the cooperatives because the policy explanation was not clear when carrying out advanced cooperativization. This problem was quickly corrected and resolved after it was discovered.

Generally speaking, the situation of agricultural production increase last year was: in addition to the increase of 2.1 billion jin of grain, cash crops, poultry breeding, and sideline production all increased compared to the previous year. This achievement was precisely achieved on the basis of increased grain production. However, it cannot be said that there is no problem with grain in Guangdong. At present, the food ration per person is not very abundant. The natural population growth rate in the province is above 2% (the Xiachun Cooperative in Chao'an County even reached 9% last year). Animal husbandry needs to be developed on a large scale, all of which require grain. This year, Guangdong will reduce the output of rice and paddy fields by about 600 million jin by expanding cash crops and retaining enough private plots. Therefore, the policy of focusing on grain production cannot be shaken in the slightest.

In order to implement the agricultural production policy, two main channels must be taken in Guangdong, namely, increasing the multiple cropping index and increasing the yield per unit area. Guangdong has little land and a large population. The average land per person is only 1.5 mu, and in some areas, the average per person is only about 0.5 mu. Therefore, if the multiple cropping index is not increased, it is impossible to meet the requirements of increasing production. (The multiple cropping rate in the province has now reached 200%) In the future, it is planned to continue to expand the winter planting area, and continue to implement single-season to double-season cropping in areas where conditions permit, striving to reach a multiple cropping index of 260% by 1962, basically achieving three harvests a year. At the same time, a series of production increase measures will be taken to increase the yield per unit area. Last year, several cooperatives in Guangdong broke the national rice production record of 2,012.6 jin per mu created by Lin Yancheng. The Dongling Agricultural Cooperative in Tunchang County, Hainan, has reached 2,364.9 jin per mu. Although the number of counties with a grain yield of 1,000 jin has increased to six, the average yield of grain per mu in the province is only 500 jin, and there is still great potential to be tapped. At present, the province is using and leveraging the superiority of the cooperatives, thinking of every possible way to increase the yield per unit area, striving for a bumper harvest this year, and striving to achieve the goal of 800 jin of grain per mu in most areas by 1962.

Farmers' Food Rations Have Increased and Purchasing Power Has Increased; Continue to Overcome Difficulties and Improve Living Standards

(3) Due to the increase in agricultural production, the progress of industry, transportation, commerce, culture, and education has been more powerfully promoted, and the lives of the people of the province are improving year by year.

First of all, food rations have increased. Before liberation, the average farmer only had 200 to 250 jin of rice per person per year excluding miscellaneous grains, and now it has increased to about 400 jin (reaching more than 500 jin including miscellaneous grains converted to grain). The alluvial soil area (Pearl River Delta) has even reached 600-700 jin of rice, and even the ethnic minority areas of Hainan generally reach 400-500 jin.

Secondly, the consumption of necessities and daily necessities has also increased greatly. From the rural areas alone, comparing 1956 with 1955, the total amount of social purchasing power increased by 10.68%. In 1955, 4.57 million bolts of cloth were sold in rural areas, and in 1956, it increased to 6.21 million bolts, an increase of 35.87%, with an average increase of more than two zhang of cloth per household; in 1955, 1.96 million dan of sugar were sold, and in 1956, it increased to 2.34 million dan, an increase of 19.39%; other items such as vests and towels have increased by more than 30%.

The improvement of people's lives is also reflected in the development of education and culture. In 1956, cultural and educational expenditures accounted for 30.8% of the province's fiscal expenditure. The number of students was the largest in Guangdong's history. The total number of university, middle, and elementary school students reached 4.4 million. An increase of more than 800,000 people compared to 1955; an increase of more than 2.27 million people compared to the early days of liberation, more than doubling; last year, the number of rural film projection teams increased from 130 to 280, the number of rural clubs increased from 457 to 15,700, and the number of rural amateur theater troupes increased from more than 4,000 to more than 8,000. Three highly infectious diseases, plague, smallpox, and cholera, have become historical relics, and 50,000 leprosy patients and 100,000 schistosomiasis patients are gradually receiving treatment. Health work in both urban and rural areas has developed greatly.

The lives of urban people have also improved greatly. Guangzhou and other provincial-level cities were quite prosperous last year. Last year, the number of employed people in Guangzhou reached 112,471, the highest in history. After the wage reform, the lives of urban people have improved significantly.

The people's savings in 1956 were also the largest since liberation, totaling 100.8 million yuan in the province, an increase of 27% compared to 1955.

We fully acknowledge that today's living standards, especially the living standards of farmers, are still very low. Although Guangdong's agricultural production increased greatly last year, and the total output value increased from 3 billion yuan in 1955 to 3.38 billion yuan, if distributed with 60% of the net income, the average income per farming household in the province is only about 270 yuan. In particular, 15% of the households in the province have reduced production, and they must gradually increase their income year by year; 6 million mu of paddy fields were affected by drought last year, and the population in the disaster area is nearly 3 million. It is necessary to ensure that their current lives can continue, and to overcome difficulties through production for self-relief; the enthusiasm for winter planting last year was not as good as the previous year, and a cold wave around the Spring Festival caused damage to various crops, increasing the difficulty of completing this year's grain production increase task and the severity of the spring famine. All of this requires us to strengthen political and ideological work among cadres and the masses of farmers, greatly promote the spirit of democracy, advocate a thrifty style, resolutely oppose bureaucracy and subjectivism, lead deep into the masses, become one with the masses, think of every possible way to overcome various difficulties, strive for a bumper harvest this year, and make 1957 a glorious and brilliant year for exceeding the first Five-Year Plan.

### 广东省农村面貌焕然一新　饶彰风的发言

专栏：

    广东省农村面貌焕然一新
　　饶彰风的发言
    我对于毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话及周总理的政治报告，表示衷心拥护，对陈叔通副主席的政协工作报告也完全同意，现在我就广东农村工作方面的问题发表几点意见：
　　农民们说合作化后农村有八变三几年之内收入可超过上中农
      （一）广东是一个富饶的省份，四季常青，生产门路甚多；但又毗邻港澳，海岸线最长，旅外侨胞最多，加以过去与帝国主义接触最早，经济发展，带有明显的殖民地性质，因之在广东既富有革命精神，同时资本主义的影响也是极为深广的，敌我斗争非常尖锐，是一个很复杂的地方，解放以来，广东省搞土改，搞三反，搞民主改革，搞思想改造，特别是去年搞社会主义的三大改造，所受到的阻力是比较大的。在广东工作的同志都有这样的认识：既要十分勇敢坚定，又要特别谨慎细心。七年来广东工作是有不少缺点错误的，但在中央正确领导下，由于全省人民的努力，确实做了不少工作，取得了很大的成绩。特别是在去年完成了农业合作化。不仅使全省农民走上集体富裕的道路，而且有力地促进了手工业和资本主义工商业社会主义改造的实现，使广东和全国一道战胜了资本主义，走上了社会主义的康庄大道。
    新生的社会主义农业经济一经诞生，就显示了伟大的生命力和无比的优越性。去年广东自然灾害不轻，约有六分之一的水田遭受到不同程度的旱灾，初成立的合作社家底单薄，经营管理的经验不足，但是依靠了合作社的优越条件，依靠了全体社员的艰苦奋斗，全省农业生产却取得了巨大的丰收，粮食增产二十一亿斤，为解放以来增产最多的一年，全省有70％以上的合作社增了产，75％以上的社员增加了收入。千斤县由原有的三个（潮安、澄海、潮阳）增加到六个（增加普宁、揭阳、南澳），千斤社由原有的八百五十个增加到三千六百七十个，全省有一千个以上的合作社赶上了上中农的平均收入水平，其中有的合作社每个劳动日分值达到3.13元以上（如东莞麻涌南洲社），一年之内，二千一百万以上的农民得到不同程度的增收，在广东是史无前例的。东江农民说：
  “合作化后农村有八变：瘦田变肥田，荒田变良田，旱地变水田，缺粮变余粮，穷村变富村，穷人变富人，懒汉变劳模，野孩变学生”。这是农民对合作化优越性的生动的总结。
    可是还有人减收，还有人退社，这怎样解释呢？去年广东确有15％左右的农户减收，在秋收后少数地区曾经一度出现有六万户退社现象。但是减收的是那些人呢？首先是上中农，上中农在广东农村一般地区占总农户的9％，在经济作物区占15％—20％，他们过去的收入水平比较高。入社后，除个人的劳动技术外，其他条件都不起作用了，所以有相当数量的上中农减收。其次，广东的商品经济是比较发达的，把许多兼业的小商贩和手工业者规划到合作社里来，兼业收入没有了，只有农业收入，因此也有人减收。还有原来土地多、劳动力少的农户，取消了土地报酬后，也减少了一些收入。当然也有不少减收户是因为自然灾害严重和我们的工作没有做好而造成的。但是，对于上述农户来说，即使工作没有缺点，在最好情况下，也很难做到在办社的第一年就户户增收，不过可以肯定：今后一年会比一年好，三几年之内一定能赶上并超过上中农的平均收入水平。这一点就是一些闹退社的社员也很清楚。所以，在经过一番教育工作之后，闹退社的社员已经大体稳定下来，退出去的六万户中有两万多户又重新回到合作社里来了。
    当然，新生的合作社也不可避免地存在着一些缺点，这主要是由于时间短和缺乏经验的缘故，我们相信，由于社员和干部的努力，以及各方面的爱护，这些缺点是一定可以克服的。
　　以粮食为主的生产方针收效大提高单位面积产量争取大丰收
　　（二）广东早在土改结束后，即提出以农业为重点的方针，在这一总的方针下，并提出农业生产以增产粮食为主，同时积极发展经济作物，开展多种经营，全面发展农业经济。这是完全符合广东实际情况的，并为中央所批准，实践证明，这一方针是完全正确的。但是，有人说：“广东不提以发展工业为重点，和在农业上又不以发展经济作物为主，这是忽视广东特点的做法，不是因地制宜的做法”。这种说法对不对呢？是不对的。广东人民所最关心的首先是肚子吃饱的问题，而不愿再看见广东仍旧成为向帝国主义输出贱价原料和购进“洋米”的市场，而1943年饿死百余万人的大饥荒，对广东人民是一个记忆犹新的极惨痛的教训。今天广东已由缺粮省一变而为余粮省，1952年以来，平均每年还能外调粮食四亿斤左右；同时又发展了各种经济作物和多种经营，既保证了农民能吃得饱，打下了逐步增加农民收入的巩固基础，又为全国社会主义建设提供了粮食和工业原料，广东人民十分高兴自己能为我国的工业化大厦加添一块有用的基石。
    当然广东在执行农业生产方针方面也不是没有缺点和错误的。去年上半年开头，曾经一度存在某些主观、片面和急躁情绪，这主要是过分强调了粮食增产，对多种经营强调不够，同时在一些条件还不具备的地区，过早过急地推行技术改革，造成一些损失，对于这些缺点和错误，已在去年4月以后加以纠正。
    正由于广东贯彻了农业生产的正确方针，去年农业增产的成绩是很大的：
    去年全省粮食（包括杂粮）总产量达到二百四十亿斤，比前年增加二十一亿斤，增产9.8％，比1949年增加50％，比解放前最高年份（1936年）增加40％。
    经济作物方面虽然由于去年上半年抓得不够紧，个别项目如蚕茧减产、苎麻没有完成任务，但总产值仍比前年增加11％，特别是甘蔗的增产相当快，使榨糖工业有了迅速发展，去年全省产糖四十余万吨，比前年增加12％，比1949年增加四点二倍，比解放前最高产量（1936年）增加一倍，去年外调糖增加到二十五万吨，而1952年广东外调糖只有十二万吨。
    饲养业方面：自实行统购统销以来，数量是减少的，但是去年下半年开始有了显著的恢复。例如母猪数量年初只有三十万头，年底已发展到六十万头，肉猪宰杀量达四百九十五万担，接近1954年五百一十九万担的最高产量。鸡、鸭等发展更快，特别是鸭比往年大大增加，例如新会县1955年养鸭四十万只，去年发展到一百七十万只，增加三倍多。现在除了猪肉供应仍生产落后于需要外，其他鸡、鸭等家禽的货源现在是充足的，牛肉、塘鱼等供应也颇充裕。
    林业方面：去年造林五百多万亩，超过计划7％，成活率达70％，是历年来发展最快、成绩最大的一年。
    渔业方面：1955年是五十二万吨，1956年是五十三万多吨，而1952年只有二十九万吨。
    副业生产：1955年总产值四亿一千万元，去年四亿九千万元，较1955年增加20％。总之，去年农业生产各个战线获得的成绩是很大的，而这个成绩正是农业合作化的胜利所带来的结果。
    有人说：“粮食是增加了，但是经济作物却减少了”。实际情况怎样呢？广东的经济作物总面积是逐年扩大的，特别是甘蔗、油料作物、烟和麻等种植面积去年达到六百万亩，比1952年增加40％以上。只是去年上半年由于贯彻生产方针时的不够全面，在某些地区挤掉了一些零星的经济作物，这种情况去年下半年起已经纠正过来，有的正在纠正。现就甘蔗、黄麻、苎麻与柑子等四种经济作物为例来讲，广东这几年的制糖工业能如此迅速的发展，去年省内供应与外调那样多（糖产量几乎占全国总产量的一半），不是甘蔗的发展与增产，是办不到的。黄麻1955年产量七十三万担，1956年增至九十八万担，我们去年除自用外，外调也增加到十四万八千担（1955年仅九万八千担），苎麻1953年全省只种植五千五百亩，去年已达到七万亩。柑子也是逐年发展的，去年潮州柑也是增产，如果说前年为保证出口，广州市不容易买到潮州柑，而去年则既保证了出口，广州市又到处可以买到，并且可以卖到今年4月份。不错，去年广东全省是砍掉近一万亩柑树，这是因为每年有几千亩须要更替的老树必须砍掉，同时去年黄龙病为害很严重，为防止病的传染蔓延，也砍掉了几千亩。其中极少数是在搞高级合作化时，政策交代不明确，农民不愿将柑树作价入社而砍掉的，这问题发现后即已迅速纠正解决。
    总的说来，去年农业增产的情况是：除粮食增产二十一亿斤外，经济作物、家禽饲养业和副业生产，都比前年增加，这个成绩也正是粮食增产的基础上取得的。但是，并不能说，广东的粮食已经没有问题了。目前，每人的口粮还不是很充裕的，全省人口自然增长率在2％以上（潮安县的下村社去年竟达9％）。饲养业还要大量发展，所有这些都需要粮食，而广东今年扩大经济作物和留足自留地，大约要减去六亿斤稻谷产量与稻田，因此，以粮食生产为主的方针仍然是丝毫不能动摇的。
    为了贯彻农业生产方针，在广东要通过两个主要途径，即提高复种率和提高单位面积产量。广东地少人多，每人平均土地只有一点五亩，部分地区每人平均只有五分地左右。因此，如果不提高复种指数是无法满足增产要求的。（现在全省复种率已达200％）今后准备继续扩大冬种面积，并在条件具备的地区继续实行单造改双造，争取到1962年复种指数达到260％，基本上做到一年三熟。同时，要进行一系列的增产措施来提高单位面积产量。广东去年有好几个合作社打破了林炎城创造的亩产二千零一十二点六斤的全国水稻丰产最高纪录，海南屯昌县东岭农业社已达到亩产二千三百六十四点九斤，粮食千斤县虽然增加到六个，但是全省粮食每亩平均产量却只有五百斤，还大有潜力可挖。目前全省正利用和发挥合作社的优越性，想尽一切办法来提高单位面积产量，争取今年大丰收，争取1962年在绝大部分地区达到亩产粮食八百斤的目标。
　　农民们口粮增加购买力提高继续克服困难提高生活水平
    （三）由于农业增产，便更有力地推动了工业、交通、商业、文教各方面工作的进步，全省人民的生活正在逐年提高。
    首先是口粮增加了。解放前一般农民每人每年除杂粮外只有二百斤至二百五十斤稻谷，现在增加到四百斤左右（连杂粮折谷达五百多斤），沙田地区（珠江三角洲）更达到六百—七百斤稻谷，就是海南少数民族地区一般也达到四百—五百斤。
    其次生活必需品和日用品的消费量也大大提高了。单从农村说，如以1956年和1955年作比较，社会购买力总额增加了10.68％，布匹1955年农村销售四百五十七万匹，1956年增加到六百二十一万匹，增加了35.87％，平均每户增加两丈多布；糖1955年销售一百九十六万担，1956年增至二百三十四万担，增加了19.39％；其它如背心、毛巾等均增加了30％以上。
    人民生活的改善还表现在教育文化事业的发展上。1956年的文教经费占全省财政支出的30.8％。学生数量是广东历史上最多的一年。大、中、小学生总共达到四百四十万人。比1955年增加八十多万人；比解放初期增加二百二十七万人即一倍多；去年农村电影队由一百三十队发展到二百八十队，农村俱乐部由四百五十七个发展到一万五千七百个，农村业余剧团由四千多个发展到八千多个。鼠疫、天花、霍乱三种烈性传染病已经成为历史陈迹，五万麻疯病人和十万血吸虫患者正在逐步受到治疗。城市和农村的卫生工作均有很大的发展。
    城市人民的生活也有很大改善。广州市和其他省辖市去年都是相当繁荣的，去年广州市就业人数达十一万二千四百七十一人，是历史上最高的一年，工资改革后城市人民生活有了显著的提高。
    1956年的人民储蓄也是解放以来最多的一年，全省共有一亿零八十万元，比1955年增加27％。
    我们完全承认今天人民生活水平尤其是农民生活水平还很低，尽管广东去年农业大增产，生产总值由1955年的三十亿元增加到三十三亿八千万元，但是如以60％的纯收入来分配，全省每一农户平均收入不过二百七十元左右。特别是全省有15％的减产户，必须使之逐年增收；去年六百万亩水田受旱，灾区人口近三百万，必须使他们眼前的生活过得下去，并通过生产自救来克服困难；去年冬种劲头不如前年，春节前后一次寒流又使各种作物受到损失，增加完成今年粮食增产任务的困难和春荒的严重性。所有这些，都要求我们必须在干部和农民群众中加强政治思想工作，大大发扬民主精神，提倡勤俭作风，坚决反对官僚主义与主观主义，领导深入群众，与群众打成一片，想出一切办法来克服各种困难，争取今年大丰收，使1957年成为超额完成第一个五年计划光辉灿烂的一年。（附图片）
