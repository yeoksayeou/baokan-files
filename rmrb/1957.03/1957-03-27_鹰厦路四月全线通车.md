Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Kuihua reports: The Yingtan-Xiamen Railway is scheduled to begin direct passenger and freight transport along the entire line in April. At present, all preparatory work for the full line opening has been basically completed. Railway employees at stations in the southern section are busy with the final task – arranging ticket offices and waiting rooms. Track patrolmen in hundreds of track maintenance teams are working day and night, taking shifts to carefully inspect the tracks, so that the first direct Yingtan-Xiamen train can pass smoothly and safely.

Various materials waiting to be transported are now piled up like mountains at each station. It is expected that after direct passenger and freight transport is carried out along the entire line, an even more prosperous scene will appear on the line.

　  鹰厦路四月全线通车
    据新华社记者刘葵华报道：鹰潭—厦门铁路预定在4月份办理全线直通客、货运输。目前迎接全线通车的各项准备工作已经基本上就绪。南段各车站的铁路员工们，正在忙碌地做最后的一项工作——布置票房和候车室。上百个养路工区的巡道工们，正日夜轮班在线路上细心地巡查轨道，以便使未来的第一列鹰潭—厦门直达列车平稳安全地通过。
    现在集中在各车站待运的各种物资，堆积如山。预计全线办理直通客货运输后，线路上将会出现更加繁荣的景象。
