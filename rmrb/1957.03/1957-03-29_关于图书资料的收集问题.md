　　On the Collection of Books and Materials
　　Commentator of This Newspaper

　　Since the call to "March towards science" was made last year, the collection of books and materials has become a nationwide wave. Taking the antique book industry in Beijing as an example, almost every family sent people out to travel all over the inland provinces, collecting many books from large and small cities and counties. However, the supply-demand relationship is still very tight. Bookstore managers are often worried about being "empty commanders," and customers are afraid of not being able to buy books.

　　This is one aspect of the situation. On the other hand, in the past, various agencies and public and private antique book businesses, cultural relic preservation agencies, etc., generally showed great one-sidedness in the collection of materials and books, with individual exceptions: they emphasized the ancient over the modern, the version over the content; among the content, they only valued the content of a few major events (such as the Opium War, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the Boxer Rebellion, etc.), and underestimated the content that reflects the daily social and economic lives of the people. And these materials are being lost and damaged in large quantities. For example, according to the statistics of the Hunan Cultural Bureau at the end of last year, about eight million catties of books and materials were destroyed in the past few years, which may include not only good versions of books, but also a large number of valuable materials. The archives of the "Confucius Mansion" in Qufu, from the Ming Dynasty to the Republic of China, are arranged in the order of heaven, earth, black, and yellow, most of which are archives related to land, which are the most complete archives for studying the Chinese land system. However, they were not well preserved in the past, placed in damp rooms and packed in sacks, where they were gnawed by rats and eaten by insects. They were only initially rescued last year. It is said that a proclamation by Li Zicheng was taken by a cultural troupe to be used as a backdrop for the performance of "Chuang Wang Enters Beijing" and its whereabouts are unknown. Hunan found "Xiangjiang Review" from the waste paper pile; the Shanghai Cultural Bureau selected many useful historical relics and books from the waste copper and waste paper recycling units, and may have also let go of a batch of valuable materials, which would have been "legally" destroyed.

　　It is said that the "Firecracker Production Cooperative" in Tunxi, Anhui, acquired a batch of books for making firecrackers, including many important materials such as land registers from the Ming and Qing dynasties; a supply and marketing cooperative in Suzhou that specializes in acquiring so-called rags and waste paper has several rooms of books, including not only Ming editions, but also a large number of useful materials. As early as December 1951, the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Light Industry jointly issued "Instructions on Prohibiting the Use of Old Woodblock Books as Raw Materials for Paper Pulp," and on September 3, 1956, the Ministry of Culture and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives jointly issued a "Notice on Strengthening the Protection of Cultural Relics," which clearly stipulated that "the task of supply and marketing cooperatives to recycle waste products is only to acquire waste and old materials, not to acquire cultural relics. However, cultural relics are often found in the waste and old materials acquired by supply and marketing cooperatives in the past, so the work of identification and selection should be strengthened, and cultural departments should closely contact the acquisition units of supply and marketing cooperatives and cooperate in identification and selection in a timely manner. It is required that on the one hand, cultural relics are protected, and on the other hand, materials are not stockpiled." Some places have earnestly implemented these two joint notices and achieved practical results; other places have not paid attention and suffered huge losses. Relevant parties should check this situation.

　　As for objects, for example, steles, the past "Jinshi Lu" or "Fangbei Lu" only paid attention to the steles of famous people and the calligraphy of famous people, but rarely paid attention to the many important materials left on the inscriptions. For example, after the "Eternal Prohibition of Loom Workshops Calling for Rest Stele" in Suzhou was discovered, the Jiangsu Provincial Museum paid attention to this work, and the Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee also made a decision. Nearly a hundred such steles have been discovered two months ago. This is an important harvest after attention was drawn, but in places that have not attracted attention, damage is happening every day. Therefore, universal attention must be paid.

　　There are also other objects related to production materials and means of livelihood. Due to the great social changes, if they are not collected immediately, there will be nothing to collect in the future.

　　The antique book industry has received some fish scale registers, genealogies, and a small number of contracts, letters, etc. But in general, the number is still very small, and they are collected incidentally. How to make these useful books, materials and objects truly valued, collected, preserved and utilized is an issue that should be taken seriously. Therefore, we suggest:

　　1. It is necessary to vigorously publicize and implement the state's policies and regulations on the protection of cultural relics, especially some competent authorities, to implement the policies and regulations to the grassroots level, give play to the enthusiasm of the masses in cherishing local cultural relics, and mobilize everyone to collect, supervise and protect all useful cultural relic materials.

　　2. When libraries, cultural centers, archives, and cultural relic protection agencies across the country interview, collect, and protect books, materials, and objects, they should treat version books, content of major historical events, and books, materials, and objects that reflect the daily social and economic lives of the people with "equal" importance, and should not neglect either.

　　3. When public and private antique book businesses acquire books in various places, they should pay attention to the above-mentioned materials that can reflect the political, economic, military, cultural, diplomatic, ethnic and other aspects of past dynasties, including books, magazines, gazettes, charts, photographs, portraits, fish scale registers, contracts, agreements, account books, passports, vouchers, price lists, yearbooks, diaries, letters, biographies, biographies, genealogies, folk songbooks, scripts, and rubbings of stone inscriptions, etc. (the above are just examples). It is hoped that the cultural departments of various places will regard the acquisition of books and materials by the antique book industry as a beneficial work for the country, and should give them various conveniences as much as possible (this is different from prohibiting antique dealers from collecting unearthed antiquities in the areas where they are unearthed, because doing so stimulates theft). Some undue obstacles in the past should be removed so that their manpower and material resources can be more fully utilized.

　　4. All agencies that preserve materials should compile catalogs as soon as possible, and organize and print the materials so that everyone can use them.

　　关于图书资料的收集问题
　　本报评论员
    自从去年“向科学进军”的号召提出以后，图书资料的收集，形成一个全国的浪潮。就以北京古旧书业来说，几乎家家有人出外，跑遍了内地各省，从大城小县搜罗了许多书籍。但是，供求关系仍然十分紧张，书店经理时常忧虑怕当“空军司令”，顾客怕买不到书。
    这是一方面的情况。另一方面，过去收集或采购图书的各机关和公私古旧书业、文物保管机关等，除个别的以外，对于资料、图书的收集，普遍地表现了很大的片面性：就是重古轻今，重版本，轻资料；资料之中，又只重视几个大事件的资料（如鸦片战争，太平天国，义和团等）；轻视反映人民群众日常社会经济生活的资料。而这些资料正在大批的散失和损坏。例如，据湖南文化局去年年底的统计，几年来毁掉的图书资料约八百万斤，其中不仅可能有很好的版本书，也会有大批有价值的资料。曲阜“孔府”的档案，从明朝起至民国的都有，按天、地、玄、黄等次序排架，其中绝大部分是有关地亩的档案，是研究中国土地制度的一批最完整的档案资料。可是，过去保存得非常不好，在潮湿的屋里放着，麻袋里装着，鼠咬虫吃，去年才得到初步的抢救。据说其中有一张李闯王的布告，被一个文工团拿去演“闯王进京”当布景用而不知下落了。湖南从废纸堆里找出来“湘江评论”；上海文化局从废铜废纸收购单位拣选了许多有用的历史文物和图书，还可能放掉了一批有价值的资料，而这批资料就会被“合法”地毁掉了。
    据说安徽屯溪“花炮生产合作社”收购一批预备造炮竹用的图书，其中有许多明清两代的田亩册子等重要资料；苏州有一家专门收购所谓破布废纸的供销合作社，收有几屋子的图书，其中不但有明版书，而且有大批有用的资料。文化部和轻工业部远在1951年12月即联合发出了“关于禁用旧板书做纸浆原料的指示”，1956年9月3日文化部和全国供销合作总社联合发出“加强保护文物工作的通知”，明确规定“供销合作社废品回收的任务，只是收购废旧物资，不收购文物。但以往供销合作社收购的废旧物资中，经常有文物发现，因此应加强鉴选工作，文化部门应与供销合作社收购单位密切联系，及时进行配合鉴选。要求一方面使文物得到保护，一方面使物资不致积压。”这两个联合通知，有的地方抓紧贯彻，就收到实效；有的地方没有注意，就受到巨大的损失。这种情况，有关方面应该加以检查。
    再就实物方面来说，例如石碑，过去的“金石录”也好，“访碑录”也好，只是注意名人的碑，名人的字，而很少注意碑刻上留下的许多重要的材料。例如，苏州的“永禁机房叫歇碑”被发现以后，江苏省博物馆注意了这个工作，江苏省人民委员会也做出决定，两月前已经发现了近百块的这类碑刻。这是引起了注意以后的重要收获，但是未引起注意的地方，就天天在损坏。因此，还必须普遍加以注意。
    还有其他有关生产资料、生活资料的实物，由于社会的大变革，如果不即时收集，将来就没有东西可收了。
    古旧书业曾经收到了一些鱼鳞册、家谱，以及一小部分契约、信札等。但总的说来，为数还是极少的，而且是附带收集的。如何使这些有用的图书、资料和实物，受到真正的重视，加以收集、保存和利用，这是应该引起重视的问题。因此我们建议：
    一、要大力宣传和贯彻国家的文物保护的政策、法令，尤其是一些主管部门，要把政策、法令贯彻到基层，发挥群众爱护乡土文物的积极性，大家起来收集、监督和保护一切有用的文物资料。
    二、全国各地图书馆、文化馆、资料室、文物保护机关在采访、收集、保护图书资料和实物的时候，应该对版本图书、重大历史事件的资料，同反映人民群众日常社会经济生活的图书资料和实物，予以“并重”的看待，不可偏废。
    三、公私古旧书业在各地收购图书的时候，要注意上述能够反映历代政治、经济、军事、文化、外交、民族等方面的材料，包括图书、杂志、公报、图表、照片、画像、鱼鳞册、契约、合同、帐簿、护照、凭证、价目表、同学录、日记、信札、行状、传记、家谱、民间唱本、脚本以及石刻拓片等（上述不过是举例）。希望各地文化部门，对古旧书业的收购图书资料，应看作替国家作了一项有益的工作，应尽量予以各种便利（这与禁止古玩商在出土古物地区收集古物是不同的，因为那样作，是刺激了盗掘）。过去有些不应有的阻碍应当撤除，使他们的人力物力更能充分的发挥。
    四、各个保存资料的机关，应尽量即时地编制目录，并且把资料整理印行，让大家都能利用。
