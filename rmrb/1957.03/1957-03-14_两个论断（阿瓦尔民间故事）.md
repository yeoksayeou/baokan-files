    Two Arguments
    (Avar Folk Tale)
    There was a man lying on his back under a walnut tree, enjoying the shade. Under this huge walnut tree, he saw such small fruits growing on the branches; turning his head, he saw large pumpkins growing in the vegetable garden next to him.
    "Ha," he said, "things in the world are truly unfair: such a thick tree trunk should grow pumpkins, while such a thin vine should grow walnuts."
    Just then, a walnut fell from the tree and landed right on his forehead.
    "Ouch, ouch, ouch!" he cried. "Everything in the world is the fairest! If a big pumpkin had fallen from the tree, I would have been done for."

    两个论断
    （阿瓦尔民间故事）
    有一个人仰面朝天地躺在一棵核桃树下乘凉。在这巨大的核桃树下，他看见树枝上长着那么小的果实；一侧头，他又看到旁边的菜园里长着挺大个儿的南瓜。
    “嗐，”他说道，“世界上的事情真不公平：这么粗大的树干上应该长南瓜，而那样细的瓜蔓上应该长核桃才对。”
    正在这时候，一个核桃从树上落了下来，正巧落在他的脑门上。
    “唉哟，唉哟，唉哟！”他喊道。“世界上的一切事情是最公平的！要是从树上落下一个大南瓜来，那我准完蛋啦。”
