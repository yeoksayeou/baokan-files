Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: The pseudo "Taiwan Provincial Provisional Assembly" held a meeting in mid-March, during which "assemblyman" Li Wanju raised eighteen "worrying phenomena in Taiwan" to question the Kuomintang authorities. This revealed the dark rule of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan and the contradictions between the Kuomintang power-holders in Taiwan and the local Taiwanese factions.

According to the "Public Opinion Daily" in Taipei City, which is run by Li Wanju, in Taiwan, "people are terrified whenever they hear talk of democracy and freedom, considering it nothing less than a monstrous flood." This is the first worrying point Li Wanju believes exists. The second worry is the lack of political and cultural progress in Taiwan.

Li Wanju said: "The third worrying phenomenon in Taiwan concerns banned books. The cultural circles in Taiwan can be said to have reached a point of extreme famine in recent years, the reason being that too few new works are published, and most of them are crude and poorly made, with few elaborate works. Furthermore, some works that were published on the mainland in the past are not allowed to be published in Taiwan Province. For example, Lu Simian's 'General History of China' is reportedly on the list of banned books. The works of Liang Shuming, Zhu Guangqian, Shen Congwen, and others have all been banned. The list of banned books in Taiwan today is truly as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, impossible to count. I don't know what the standard for banning books is?"

"The fourth worrying phenomenon in Taiwan is the cases of suicide, homicide, assassination, rape-murder, and love-related killings in Taiwan in recent years. Opening the newspaper, it is truly shocking and frightening, happening almost every day. This phenomenon is a sign of social unrest."

In listing the fifth to twelfth "worrying phenomena in Taiwan," Li Wanju revealed the Chiang Kai-shek clique's reign of terror by secret agents in Taiwan. He said that the Chiang Kai-shek clique's special agent organization, the "Investigation Bureau," originally under the "Ministry of the Interior," has now been changed to be under the "Ministry of Justice Administration." As a result, special agents "not only have the power to investigate cases, but also have the identity of bailiffs, and can arrest people anytime, anywhere, and handle cases." In addition, many cases in Taiwan that are unrelated to Chiang's military law are being tried and handled by Chiang's military law organs. And "when ordinary Taiwanese people talk about the judiciary in Taiwan, few do not express doubts about its independence." The courts in Taiwan often have their case judgments interfered with from the outside, and there is no so-called "rule of law." Li Wanju also said that not long ago, a case occurred in Taiwan where "Supervisory Committee member" He Jizhou was accused of bribery and dereliction of duty, which was actually a frame-up by special agents. The intention of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in creating this case was to "kill the chicken to scare the monkeys," so that so-called "representatives of the people" such as "Supervisory Committee members," "Legislative Committee members," and "assemblymen" would be even more afraid to speak out in the future, "becoming cicadas in winter."

The "county magistrates," "township chiefs," and so-called "assemblymen" in Taiwan are nominally produced by "popular elections." In the thirteenth to sixteenth "worries," Li Wanju exposed this deceptive "popular election" farce. Li Wanju said that in various places in Taiwan during "elections," the Kuomintang-nominated candidates often appear in a situation of "one person running for election." When Xinzhu City elected a "mayor," only one candidate from the Kuomintang "ran for election," and others were threatened not to participate in the "election." As a result, 90% of voters did not participate in the vote to protest. "Similar situations are everywhere in Taiwan." Some people disregarded the Kuomintang's threats to participate in the "election" and were elected, but were either conscripted into the military or charged with some trumped-up crimes and arrested and imprisoned.

Li Wanju's seventeenth "worry" is that "everyone is burdened heavily now," but the Kuomintang Taiwan Provincial Government spent three to four hundred million Taiwan dollars to move from Taipei to Taichung.

Li Wanju's eighteenth "worry" is "the problem of rampant scalpers." He sarcastically said that in recent years, not only are there scalpers selling black market tickets in entertainment venues in Taiwan, "but even in the financial and political circles, there are scalpers, and the situation is becoming more and more rampant."

Li Wanju is one of Taiwan's local tycoons, running "Public Opinion Newspaper," "Daxing Enterprise Company," and so on.

　　台湾十八忧
    新华社28日讯  伪台湾省临时议会在3月中旬开会的时候，“议员”李万居在会上提出了十八点“台湾的可忧虑现象”质问国民党当局，其中透露了蒋介石集团在台湾的黑暗统治和台湾国民党当权派与台湾地方势力派之间的矛盾。
    据李万居主办的台北市“公论报”报道，在台湾，“偶然听到谈论民主自由，有些人便惶惶然不可终日，认为这简直是洪水猛兽”。这是李万居认为第一点可忧虑的地方。第二点忧虑是台湾政治上、文化上没有进步。
    李万居说：“台湾的可忧虑现象之三，是关于禁书的问题。台湾文化界，这几年来可以说饥荒到了极点，其原因是新的著作问世太少，并且大都是粗制滥造，精心的著作不多。而过去若干在大陆发行的，在台湾省内又不准发行。如吕思勉著的‘中国通史’听说就在禁止发行之列。梁漱溟、朱光潜、沈从文等的著作都已禁止。今天的台湾所列的禁书真是恒河沙数，无从算起，不知以什么做禁书标准？”
      “台湾可忧虑的现象之四，是台湾近年来自杀、凶杀、暗杀、奸杀、情杀的案件。翻开报纸来看，真是怵目惊心，几乎无日无之，这种现象是社会不安的征兆。”
    李万居在列举第五点到第十二点“台湾的可忧虑现象”中，透露了蒋介石集团在台湾的特务恐怖统治。他说，蒋介石集团的特务机关“调查局”，本来是隶属于“内政部”的，现在却改为隶属于“司法行政部”。这样一来，特务人员“不仅有权可以从事调查案件，而且具有法警身份，随时随地可以逮捕人，可以办理案件。”另外，目前台湾许多与蒋军军法无关的案件，却由蒋军军法机关审讯办理。而“台湾老百姓一谈到台湾司法，很少人不对它的独立性表示怀疑”，台湾的法院审判案件常常受到外界的干涉，没有所谓“法治”。李万居还说，不久前台湾发生了一件“监察委员”何济周被控受贿渎职的案件，实际上是特务人员栽赃诬害。蒋介石集团制造这一案件的用意是“杀鸡给猴子看”，使“监察委员”、“立法委员”、“议员”等所谓“民意代表”，今后更加不敢说话，“变成寒蝉”。
    台湾的“县长”、“乡长”和所谓“议员”等等，名义上是由“民选”产生的。李万居在第十三点到第十六点“忧虑”中，揭露了这种欺骗性的“民选”丑剧。李万居说，台湾各地“选举”时，常常出现国民党提名的候选人“一人竞选”的局面。新竹市选举“市长”的时候，只有国民党的一个候选人“竞选”，其他的人都被恐吓不得参加“竞选”，结果90％的选民都不参加投票来抗议，“类似的情形在台湾比比皆是”。有些人不顾国民党的威胁参加
  “竞选”，并且当选了，结果不是被征召入营当兵，就是被加上一些莫须有的罪名，逮捕入狱。
    李万居的第十七点“忧虑”是“现在大家负担很重”，而国民党台湾省政府却花去三、四亿元台币，由台北搬往台中。
    李万居的第十八点“忧虑”是“黄牛猖獗问题”。他讽刺说，台湾近年来不仅娱乐场所有卖黑市票的黄牛，“甚至金融界和政治界都有黄牛，其情势越来越猖獗。”
    李万居是台湾本地的豪门之一，开设“公论报社”、“大兴企业公司”等等。
