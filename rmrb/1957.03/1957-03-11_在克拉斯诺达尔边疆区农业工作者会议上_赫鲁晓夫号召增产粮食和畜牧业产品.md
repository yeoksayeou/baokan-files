Xinhua News Agency, March 10th: According to a TASS report: On March 9th, Krasnodar (Kuban) in the Russian Federation held a conference of agricultural workers from Krasnodar Krai. The conference discussed how to rapidly increase grain production in the Krai, particularly the increase in livestock products.

When the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, spoke at the meeting, he pointed out that all possibilities should be utilized to solve the basic economic task—to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in the world in terms of per capita product production in a historically short period of time.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union's grain problem has been solved, but it cannot be considered solved if it is linked to the livestock industry. The people's consumption of milk, meat, and meat products and the industry's need for raw materials should be truly and fully guaranteed. Therefore, we should pay special attention to increasing grain production and livestock products.

Khrushchev made a detailed analysis of the agricultural situation in Krasnodar Krai. He particularly pointed out that the Kuban region should become an example of increasing the commodity rate of agricultural products, and it should become a factory of meat, milk, and the most valuable crops, which is entirely possible.

When Khrushchev talked about the issue of increasing crop yields, he cited the experience of advanced state farms and agricultural cooperatives in the German Democratic Republic. He said that the exchange of experience between Soviet collective farms and them would benefit both sides.

Khrushchev also said that as long as we implement the resolution of the February Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to reorganize the leadership departments of the national economy and give play to our organizational strength, we can achieve huge growth in industry, and we can achieve the same great achievements in industry as we have achieved in agriculture after reclaiming wasteland. Reorganizing our work according to the resolution of the February Plenary Session can open up wasteland in our industry.

    在克拉斯诺达尔边疆区农业工作者会议上
    赫鲁晓夫号召增产粮食和畜牧业产品
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社报道：俄罗斯联邦的克拉斯诺达尔（库班）在3月9日举行了克拉斯诺达尔边疆区农业工作者会议。会议讨论了如何迅速增加边疆区的粮食生产特别是增加畜牧业产品的问题。
    苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫在会上讲话的时候指出，应该利用一切可能来解决基本经济任务——在历史上极短的时间内，在按人口计算的产品生产方面，赶上和超过世界上最发达的资本主义国家。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联的粮食问题已经解决了，但是要是联系到畜牧业问题来看，就不能认为它是解决了。应该真正充分地保证人民对牛奶、肉、肉制品的消费，和保证工业对原料的需要。因此，我们还应该特别注意增加粮食生产和畜牧业产品的问题。
    赫鲁晓夫对克拉斯诺达尔边疆区的农业情况作了详细的分析。他特别指出，库班地区应该成为提高农产品商品率的范例，它应该成为肉类、牛奶和最有价值的农作物的工厂，这是完全有可能的。
    赫鲁晓夫谈到提高农作物收获量的问题的时候，举出了德意志民主共和国的先进的国营农场和农业合作社的经验。他说，苏联的农庄同它们相互交流经验对两方面都会有好处。
    赫鲁晓夫还说，只要我们实现苏共中央二月全会改组国民经济领导部门的决议并且发挥我们的组织力量，我们就能使工业有巨大的增长，我们在工业方面就能得到同在开垦生荒地之后在农业方面所得到的同样大的成就。根据二月全会的决议改组我们的工作，才能开拓我们工业中的生荒地。
