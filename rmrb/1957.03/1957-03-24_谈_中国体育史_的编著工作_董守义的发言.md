I felt extremely excited and encouraged after listening to Chairman Mao Zedong's instructions at the Supreme State Conference and the reports by Premier Zhou Enlai and other leaders. I am willing to do my utmost to implement these policies and tasks with practical actions, together with everyone.

I am a sports worker who has been engaged in sports work for forty years. In the past few years, I have been very pleased to see the vigorous development of sports in our country. In this great era, I feel even more honored to be able to contribute my modest efforts to the cause of sports for the rest of my life.

At present, the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission has determined the compilation of "A History of Chinese Sports" as its main task in the work of the Sports Technology Committee. This is a new, complex, detailed, and arduous scientific research task, which requires relying on broad social forces, especially teachers who have research in history, sports, and medicine, to pool ideas and work together. Now I would like to express some opinions on this work.

(1) The Purpose and Importance of Compiling "A History of Chinese Sports"

First, from the perspective of international influence: History proves that ancient Chinese sports not only played an active role in the health care of people of all dynasties in our country, but also made great contributions to the health care of the people of Europe and Asia. However, in the past, in the sports works of some capitalist countries, they distorted or obliterated the promotion of the poverty and simplicity of ancient Chinese sports based on some incorrect and one-sided materials. It is very necessary for us to study and organize the long-standing and rich ancient Chinese sports and historical materials, and introduce and promote them to the international community to change their views.

Second, all countries in the world have their own sports history books. Our socialist brother countries often ask us for relevant information in this area, but we always cannot produce a set of things that are based and systematic.

Third, in terms of sports teaching to the younger generation in China: Because we do not have a "History of Chinese Sports," this course has not been offered in the sports departments of sports colleges and normal colleges up to now. This will not enable them to understand the ancient sports appearance of the motherland and enhance their national self-esteem in sports. At the same time, for those who have always believed that there was no sports in ancient China and that it was completely necessary to be imported from foreign countries, it is impossible to play a persuasive educational role to further enhance their patriotic ideology.

From this, it can be seen how necessary it is to compile a systematic and complete "History of Chinese Sports" that conforms to the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint. Under the leadership of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, I personally believe that it is completely correct and timely to put this work on the agenda today.

I know for sure that there are many excellent sports in ancient China, which are still widely spread among the people, and some are unknown. However, the records in historical documents are indeed very simple, fragmented, and incomplete; the ones circulated among the people are mostly oral and without written records. This is the consequence of the feudal society and the reactionary ruling class's lack of attention to people's health. It brings us many difficulties. The investigation and excavation of these projects, the collection, synthesis, research, and organization of materials are indeed a complex and arduous task. This work cannot be successful without the support of the broad masses of the people. As far as I know, many sports people, historians, and cultural people have preserved a lot of valuable ancient and modern sports historical materials, and also have rich knowledge and research and organization capabilities in this area. I hope that they will give full attention to this work and actively support and help it, so that this work can be carried out smoothly and completed as soon as possible.

(2) Specific Measures for Carrying Out This Work

1.  Improve the organizational structure of the Sports Technology Committee, hire people who have research on the "History of Chinese Sports" to serve as members, and organize amateur forces to carry out this work in a planned way. Based on social forces, with the members of the committee as the backbone, select talents in various regions, especially large and medium-sized cities; or recommend them from various places, and everyone will cooperate, collect relevant historical materials separately, conduct research, and submit manuscripts on specific topics within a time limit. At the same time, closely integrate with the departments of various sports colleges (schools) and sports experts, as well as the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Culture, local libraries, historians, writers, medical circles, and researchers of Buddhism and Taoism to assist in this work. The subject matter of the "History of Chinese Sports" is planned to be divided into three parts: ancient history, modern history, and contemporary history. However, the current focus of specific work is on ancient history and modern history. Contemporary history first relies on the strength of various departments of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission and relevant sports colleges and sports departments, especially relevant departments such as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, the National Defense Sports Association, and the Military Commission to summarize the development of sports since liberation and further study the compilation work.
2.  Several principles for compiling the history of the development of Chinese sports: First, scientific content; second, mass orientation; third, critical spirit; fourth, educational significance; fifth, journalistic style.
3.  Issues concerning the periodization, cataloging, and main content outline of the "History of Chinese Sports."
4.  Collect all possible relevant materials from all over the country in a planned way: including recorded and unrecorded historical materials and physical objects.

(3) Based on the complexity and arduousness of the above tasks, the time to complete the "History of Chinese Sports" is initially estimated.

It is required to complete the plan in about five years (from 1957 to 1961), and to complete the first draft in about three years. The specific time allocation is: the first year to establish the organization and collect materials; the second year to carry out the division of labor and compilation; the third year to research and organize, and basically complete the first draft; the fourth year to collect opinions, make corrections, and strive to finalize the manuscript in the fifth year after the review of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission.

Please criticize and correct the above opinions, comrades. Please help us in the future work!

And wish the conference a victorious completion, and everyone good health. (Attached picture)

　　谈“中国体育史”的编著工作
　　董守义的发言
    我听了毛泽东主席在最高国务会议上的指示和周恩来总理及各位首长的报告后，我感到莫大兴奋和鼓舞。我愿竭尽个人力量以实际行动和大家一道来贯彻执行这些方针和任务。
    我是一个体育工作者，从事体育工作已有四十年的历史。几年来，我亲眼看到我国体育运动蓬蓬勃勃的情况，感到十分快慰。在这个伟大时代里，我能在体育事业方面贡献棉薄之力以终其身，更觉得非常荣幸。
    目前国家体委在运动技术委员会工作方面，已确定以编著“中国体育史”为主要任务。这是一项新的、复杂而细致的、艰巨的科学研究工作，需要依靠广大的社会力量，特别是对历史、体育和医学有研究的先生们，集思广益，共同努力。现在我仅就这项工作发表一些意见。
    （一）编著“中国体育史”的目的和重要性
    先以国际影响方面看：历史证明，我国古代体育不仅对祖国历代人民起着积极的保健作用，也对欧亚两洲人民保健事业作出了很大的贡献。但是过去长时期在一些资本主义国家的体育著作中，他们根据一些不正确的、片面的材料，歪曲或抹煞地宣传我国古代体育的贫乏与陋简。我们十分有必要把历史悠久和内容丰富的我国古代体育和历史资料加以研究整理，向国际方面介绍宣传，以改变他们的看法。
    其次，世界各国都有它本国的体育史著作，我们社会主义的兄弟国家，往往向我国索取有关这方面的资料，但我们总拿不出有根据而又系统完整的一套东西来。
    再以国内向青年一代进行体育教学方面来说：由于我们没有“中国体育史”，在体育学院和师范学院的体育系科里，一直到现在还没有开设这门功课。这就不能使他们了解祖国古代的体育面貌以及提高他们在体育方面的民族自尊心。同时对于那些过去一贯认为中国古代没有体育，完全需要由外国输入的民族虚无主义的人们，也无法起到说服教育的作用，来进一步提高他们的爱国主义思想。
    由此可见，编著一套系统而完整合乎马克思列宁主义观点的“中国体育史”是多么样的必要啊。在国家体委的领导下，今天把这项工作提到日程上来，我个人认为是完全正确和及时的。
    我确切知道我国古代有许多优秀的体育项目，至今还广泛地流传在民间，也有些湮没无闻的。但是在史籍文献中的记载，确是十分朴素、零星、片断不全；流传在民间的，也多是有口传而无笔录。这是封建社会和反动统治阶级不重视人民健康的后果。它给我们带来很多的困难。对于这些项目的调查、发掘，材料的搜集、综合、研究和整理，的确是一桩复杂而繁重的工作。这项工作离了广大人民的支持是不可能做成功的。据我所知道的，目前不少体育界人士、历史研究家和文化界人士，还保存了不少古代与近代的宝贵的体育历史资料，也具备这方面的丰富知识和研究整理的能力，希望能对这项工作予以充分的重视并积极的支持与帮助，使这项工作得以顺利进行，及早完成。
　　  （二）进行这项工作的具体措施
    1．健全运动技术委员会组织机构，聘请对“中国体育史”有研究的人们担任委员，有计划地组织业余力量来进行这一工作。以社会力量为基础，委员会的委员为骨干，在各地区特别大中城市中选择人才；或由各地推荐，大家分工合作，分别搜集有关史料，进行研究，限期分题交稿。同时密切结合各体育学院（校）系科和体育专家们及科学院、文化部、各地图书馆、历史学家、文学家、医学界以及佛、道教等有研究者协助这一工作。“中国体育史”的题材拟分古代史、近代史、现代史三个部分。但目前具体工作重点，放在古代史和近代史上，现代史首先依靠体委各部门和各有关体育学院及体育系科的力量，尤其各有关部门如总工会、团中央、高教部、教育部、卫生部、国防体协、军委等总结解放以来体育运动发展情况，进一步研究编写工作。2．编写中国体育运动发展史的几个原则问题：第一，是科学的内容；第二，群众的方向；第三，批判的精神；第四，教育的意义；第五，纪事的体裁。
    3．编写“中国体育史”的分期、编目及主要内容轮廓问题。
    4．有计划的搜集全国各地一切可能搜集的有关材料：包括有记录和没有记录的史料和实物。
    （三）根据以上任务的复杂和艰巨性来看，初步估计完成“中国体育史”的时间
    要求在五年左右完成计划（由1957年起至1961年），在三年左右完成初稿，具体时间分配：头一年建立组织、搜集材料；第二年进行分工编汇；第三年研究整理，大体完成初稿；第四年搜集意见，加以修正，经过体委审查后争取于第五年内最后定稿。
    以上这些意见，敬请各位委员、各位同志批评、指正。今后工作多请各方帮助！
    并祝大会胜利地完成，各位身体健康。（附图片）
