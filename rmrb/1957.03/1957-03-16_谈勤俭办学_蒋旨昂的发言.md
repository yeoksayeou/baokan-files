Speaking on Running Schools Through Thrift and Diligence
Jiang Zhi'ang's Speech

Premier Zhou has correctly pointed out to us: The general trend of the world is towards peace and progress. We must be good at utilizing this international atmosphere of peace, which is beneficial to our socialist construction. Increasing production and practicing economy is our basic policy for socialist construction. Under the policy of increasing production and practicing economy, we are running schools through thrift and diligence. Here, I would like to raise two issues for discussion.

The Use and Allocation of Teaching Staff in the First and Second Years of Higher Education Institutions

First, I would like to raise a question about the development scale of higher education institutions. In the future, each school will not be too large. This year, many schools will experience a sudden decrease in new students compared to last year. Many schools will face a "big belly" problem this autumn, meaning the second year will be particularly large; that is, after they move up a grade, the upper grades will be particularly large. This autumn, teachers who teach first-year courses will seem excessive, while there will be a significant shortage of second-year teachers (and a shortage of upper-grade teachers for the next few years). If we supplement the required number of second-year teachers this autumn, then next autumn some teachers will become unnecessary for the smaller class. How do we solve this contradiction?

Our suggestion is this: This autumn, the surplus first-year teachers can engage in more scientific research, or be transferred or borrowed to newly established institutions, or be lent to high schools or secondary vocational schools to teach classes. Some teachers request to take advantage of this time without classes to pursue further studies at other schools, but the number is likely too large, and the conditions may not allow it.

Regarding the shortage of teachers in the second year and above, some worry that if they are fully equipped, they will no longer be needed after teaching the large classes, leading to a waste of talent. However, we believe that if we do not equip them, the teaching staff will be insufficient, inevitably affecting the quality of teaching. And our central task in education today is already clear: to improve the quality of teaching. If the situation arises where there are enough teachers this autumn but too many next autumn, they can still turn to scientific research or be transferred to newly established institutions. A country with a population of 600 million cannot be limited to only the current two hundred higher education institutions. The number of newly established institutions will definitely increase gradually.

Because of this "big belly" problem, the saying that many higher education institutions without "development tasks" (that is, higher education institutions whose enrollment numbers are less than or equal to the number of graduates) do not need to increase their teaching staff is not entirely in line with reality. This requires overall planning and appropriate arrangements, because planned savings are the greatest savings.

The same reasoning applies: this autumn, there may be more teaching equipment for the first year, while there may be less teaching equipment for the second year and above. The excess equipment cannot be transferred or sold immediately; however, to ensure the quality of teaching, we must buy what is lacking.

What has been discussed above is the issue of avoiding one-sided economizing.

Trade Union Membership Fees and Administrative Allocations of Trade Union Funds Can Be Reduced

Next, I would like to discuss an item that should be able to be saved. Can the trade union funds allocated administratively be less than 2% of wages?

For a long time, some members of the education trade union have reflected that the trade union membership fee, set at 1% of wages, is quite high. After the wage reform in 1956, trade union funds are even higher than before, because wages have increased significantly, with the national average wage increasing by 13%, and higher education institutions possibly even higher.

After the National Congress of Education Trade Unions last summer, the guidelines and tasks have become clearer, and local grassroots trade unions are actively carrying out work. However, under the principle of "running all undertakings through thrift and diligence," it is not necessarily necessary to increase a lot of funding. Even when organizing welfare undertakings, the same applies. Premier Zhou said in his report at the "Eighth National Congress," "Some welfare undertakings can be organized without increasing the state budget expenditure."

In fact, many grassroots trade unions have surpluses every year. Recently, the higher-level trade union has allocated a larger proportion of funds to the grassroots trade unions. Therefore, under the principle of economy, membership fees should be reduced. At least the 13% increase due to the wage reform can be reduced. Furthermore, since the trade union should strive to attract all faculty and staff to join the trade union, membership fee income will increase, while expenditures will not increase proportionally, because faculty and staff who did not join the trade union in the past were not strictly limited in terms of enjoying the material rights of members. Therefore, our initial opinion is that a reduction of 20% should be possible, that is, the membership fee should be reduced from 1% of wages to 0.8%.

The trade union funds allocated administratively should also be reduced. Vice Premier Li Fuchun's statement that "social group consumption can be reduced so that it is possible to increase individual consumption" is very good. In fact, some indicators have already been reduced, for example, this year's welfare expenses have been reduced from 5% last year to 3%. Why can't the trade union funds allocated administratively also be reduced somewhat? Our initial opinion is that, like membership fees, the trade union funds allocated administratively should also be reduced by 20%, that is, from 2% of the total wage bill to 1.6%.

Let us calculate with a few whole numbers. If the trade union funds allocated administratively are ten yuan per employee per year, then 15 million employees would amount to 150 million yuan. Reducing it by 20% means reducing it by 30 million yuan. Employees with an annual salary of 500 yuan, in those places where no additional investment in equipment is needed, that is, in those places with equipment potential, can arrange employment for 60,000 people.

This is not only the matter of the education trade union, but involves all types of trade unions in the country. If it can be reduced, the exact amount of reduction can be further discussed.

Whether the above two points are appropriate or not, please criticize and correct.

### 谈勤俭办学  蒋旨昂的发言

    谈勤俭办学
    蒋旨昂的发言
    周总理给我们正确指出：世界总的趋势是走向和缓、走向进步。我们要善于利用这种对于我们社会主义建设有益的国际和缓局势。增产节约是我们社会主义建设的基本方针。在增产节约的方针下面，我们正在勤俭办学。这里提出两个问题来讨论。
    高等学校一、二年级教师力量的使用配备问题
    首先提出的是有关高等学校发展规模的一个问题。将来每校不会太大。今年有许多学校新生比较去年将有骤然的减少。许多学校今年秋季将要发生“大肚子”问题，也就是二年级特别大的问题；也就是，在他们升级之后，高年级特别大的问题。到了今年秋季，教一年级课的教师就要显得过于多了，而二年级教师却大感缺乏（以后好几年高年级教师也将大感缺乏）。如果今年秋季把二年级所缺教师补充够了，那么明年秋季又会有一部分教师变为那较小的一班所不需要的了。这个矛盾怎样解决呢？
    我们的意见是这样：今年秋季多余出来的一年级教师，可以多展开一些科学研究工作，也可以调到或借到新建院校任教，也可以借给缺乏师资的高中或中等专业学校去代课。有些教师要求趁此无课时机去他校进修，恐怕人数太多，条件不能允许。
    二年级以上所缺的教师，如果都给配备，有人担心他们把大班教过以后下一班是较小班次，便不再有需要，而形成人才的积压浪费。我们却以为假若不予配备，那么教师力量不够，必然影响教学质量。而我们教育工作今天的中心任务已然明确，是要提高教学质量。如果发生今年秋季配足、明年秋季嫌多的情况，仍然可以转入科学研究，或调到新建院校任教。六亿人口的国家决不能限定只有当前的二百所高等学校。新建院校必定要逐渐增多的。
    因为有这样一个“大肚子”问题，许多没有“发展任务”的高等学校（就是招生数少于或等于毕业生数的高等学校）就不需要增加教师编制的说法，是不完全符合实际的。这需要统筹兼顾、适当安排，因为计划所造成的节约才是最大的节约。
    同样的道理：今年秋季一年级教学设备可能多了，而二年级以上教学设备可能少了。多了的一时调不出去，一时卖不出去；少了的，却为保证教学质量，又不能不买。
    上面所谈的是应该避免片面节约观点的问题。
    工会会费和行政拨付的工会经费还可降低
    其次谈一个应该可以节约的项目。行政拨付的工会经费，可否少于工资的2％呢？
    好久以来，教育工会有一些会员就曾反映：工会会费定为工资1％，颇嫌太高。1956年工资改革以后，工会经费更较以往为多，因为工资提高很多，全国平均工资提高13％，高等学校可能还要高些。
    教育工会在去夏全国代表大会以后，方针任务更为明确了，各地基层工会都在积极展开工作，但是在“勤俭办一切事业”的原则下，也不一定非增加许多经费不可。即使举办福利事业，也是如此。周总理在“八大”报告里说过，“有一些福利事业是不需要增加国家预算的开支就可以举办的。”
    事实上，不少基层工会历年都有节余。最近上级工会更把较大比例的经费划给基层工会。所以在节约原则下，会员会费应该可以降低下来。至少可以把工资改革所加的比例13％降低下来。再因工会应该争取把全体教职工吸收到工会里来，会费收入将会增加，而支出却不会比例增加，因为以往没有加入工会的教职工在享受会员物质权利方面并未严格限制。所以我们的初步意见，降低20％应该是可以的，就是说，会费由工资的1％降到0.8％。
    行政拨付的工会经费也应降低。李富春副总理所说“可以减少社会集团的消费，以便有可能增加个人的消费”，是很好的。事实上有的指标已经降低，例如今年福利费已然由去年的5％降到3％。行政拨付的工会经费为什么不可以也降低一些呢？我们初步意见，像会费一样，行政拨付工会经费也降低20％，就是由工资总额的2％降到1.6％。
    让我们用几个整数算一算账。行政拨的工会经费如果每个职工每年十元，一千五百万职工就有一亿五千万元。少拨20％即少拨三千万元。每年工资五百元的职工，在那些不必另行投资设备的地方，就是在那些有设备潜力的地方，即可以安排六万人。
    这不仅是教育工会的事，而是牵涉到全国各种工会的。如果可以降低，究竟降低多少大家还可进一步商量。
    以上两点意见，是否有当，请批评指正。
