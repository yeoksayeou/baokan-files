Having listened to Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference and the reports of Premier Zhou and Vice Premiers Chen Yun and Li Fuchun at the CPPCC meeting, I have been greatly enlightened and immensely excited and encouraged.

Now I would like to express some immature opinions on sports activities.

    Sports Programs Should Adapt to the People's Living Habits

Last year in the second half of the year, I inspected the East China region, with my focus on sports. I found that in terms of sports coaching, there was still insufficient departure from conventional training methods, meaning that the principle of applying what one learns has not been well implemented. For example, many sports and some ball games are rarely played by people after they leave school, and even less so by middle-aged and elderly people. Therefore, I believe that sports coaches in schools, like other subjects, should implement the principle of applying what one learns. We should select and formulate some programs that, learned during student days, can be applied throughout middle and old age. These programs should not only be suitable for the elderly as much as possible, but also adapt to the living habits of the vast majority of our people. To achieve this, it is necessary to have sports programs with national characteristics. Because national-style programs have their historical roots and are closely related to people's lives, they are easy to learn and master, equipment is cheap, and they are easy to popularize. Foreign things are different; they are difficult to suit the tastes of the Chinese people, difficult to learn and even harder to master, equipment is difficult to obtain, expensive, and not easy to popularize. For example, although football has been in China for more than fifty years, it is still not very suitable for the vast majority of our people, and its equipment is not easy to obtain, the cost is high, and the field is too large. If it is popularized among the vast majority of the people, it will occupy much more good land than all the power plants in the country, which would violate the principle of land conservation mentioned by Vice Premier Li Fuchun. It should be noted that China originally had many good sports programs. Take boxing and sword dancing as examples. Foreign boxing and swordsmanship rarely depart from primitive fighting forms. The variety and artistic quality of Chinese boxing and swordsmanship are unmatched by Western countries. I think good national sports programs are worth promoting. At the same time, foreign things should be adopted critically. For example, some swimming methods can be greatly promoted and developed.

    Don't Let the Promotion of the Labor and Defense System Drift Along

The purpose of sports is to serve the people's health and national construction. For example, for national defense, there are national defense sports programs (artists should also have their own programs). Therefore, I think the labor and defense system is suitable for this purpose. It is advanced and scientific, and comprehensively develops the body. It can be said that it is revolutionary in sports. Originally, the labor and defense system developed quite well in our country and achieved good results. However, due to inadequate preparation during the testing last year, a very small number of accidents occurred, causing criticism in society. As a result, since the second half of last year, the labor and defense system has drifted along (of course, some schools and units were less affected). I think this situation is inappropriate. Of course, the labor and defense system should be combined with the specific conditions of our society and the people's living habits to adopt some reasonable programs. Therefore, I suggest that sports should develop in the direction of a labor and defense system with national characteristics.

    Mental Workers Should Participate in Physical Exercise

Because the country is currently in a high tide of socialist construction, people's selfless labor and study are admirable and should be encouraged. However, focusing only on work and study and neglecting the other aspect of health, without engaging in sports activities, often unknowingly damages the body, resulting in premature aging or long-term recuperation. This is a loss and waste of talent, and will have a certain impact on socialist construction. Chairman Mao's call for "three goods" puts good health in the first place, which tells us that while engaging in mental labor, we should engage in sports activities to avoid unnecessary losses to our health. For example, the great writer Tolstoy lived to be eighty-two years old and maintained good health and strong working ability. Another example is the great scientist Pavlov, who engaged in mental labor for as much as twelve hours a day, and his work efficiency was very high. He was almost never sick, and he maintained a high workload until his old age. He lived a healthy and happy life until he was eighty-seven years old. The reason why these two scholars were able to do this is because they combined mental labor with sports activities and a good hygiene system. Recently, the New Sports magazine recorded the life of an old Mr. Zhang Quan. Because he has always engaged in physical labor or sports activities throughout his life, he is now one hundred and twenty years old and still very healthy. Therefore, I believe that the problem of mental workers in our country today being able to conveniently obtain the sports activities they deserve has become an urgent and important issue, which is worthy of our study and should be strived for by every mental worker.

    Sports Should Consider the Health of Middle-Aged and Elderly People

The Chinese people have suffered heavy exploitation and oppression from the ruling classes of past dynasties and the imperialists in the past century, destroying the people's physique. This is one of the greatest pains of the Chinese people. Since liberation, under Chairman Mao's call to "develop sports and strengthen the people's physique," and due to the vigorous promotion of sports by the Party and the government, people's sports and health have made great progress. In Shanghai alone, there are more than 710,000 male and female athletes participating in organized sports. Such a large sports organization is unprecedented in our country, and probably has never existed in the capitalist world. Unfortunately, the only shortcoming is that very few middle-aged and elderly people participate in these activities (even fewer middle-aged and elderly women). Due to age, middle-aged and elderly people (both men and women) are not suitable for general strenuous exercise, and can only do light and soft activities, but there is no such preparation. Originally, sports workers should arrange sports activities for middle-aged and elderly people and do publicity work, but unfortunately they have not paid attention to this issue, and have not even considered the health of middle-aged and elderly people from the perspective of sports. The Party and the government take meticulous care of the lives of middle-aged and elderly people (especially the care of the elderly). Therefore, I sincerely hope that sports workers can implement this policy of the Party and the government. That is not only a blessing for middle-aged and elderly people, but also makes a great contribution to the country's maintenance of mature talents and the cause of socialist construction.

Why do I particularly emphasize sports for middle-aged and elderly people? Because today, sports for middle-aged and elderly people is the weakest link in the cause of socialist construction, and they are the largest group of people. In addition, the vast majority of those present today are of this age and are engaged in hard mental labor, but lack sports activities. Therefore, we need to march into sports to ensure our health, so that we can better, more, and longer serve human society. I respectfully ask for your criticism of the above immature opinions.

### 吸引中年和老年人参加体育活动  赵君迈对当前体育运动提出批评建议

    吸引中年和老年人参加体育活动
    赵君迈对当前体育运动提出批评建议
    此次在最高国务会议上听了毛主席的讲话，在政协会议上听了周总理和陈云、李富春两副总理的报告，给了我极大的启发和无限的兴奋和鼓励。
    现在我想就体育运动方面发表几点不成熟的意见。
    运动项目要适应人民群众的生活习惯
    去年下半年我视察了华东地区，我的视察重点是放在体育运动上面。我发现了在体育运动教练方面，尚不够脱离墨守陈规的培养方法，这就是说没有很好的做到学以致用的方针。譬如许多运动项目和某些球类，人们出了学校以后就很少再能搞那些运动，中老年就更不可能。因此我认为学校里的体育教练，也要和其他功课一样，要贯彻学以致用方针。应该选择和制定一些项目，在学生时代学习的，一直可以适用到中老年，这些项目不独尽可能适用于老年，而且更要适应我国广大人民群众的生活习惯。如果要做到这样，那就必须具有民族形式的体育运动项目。因为民族形式的项目，是有它的历史根源与人民生活有密切关系，学起来易学易精，设备便宜，又易普及。至于外来的东西那就不然，它是难合中国人民的口味的，学起来难学更难精，设备困难，费用又大，不易普及。譬如足球虽然在我国已有五十年以上的历史，但至今仍不大适合于我国广大人民之用，而且它的设备不易，费用多、场地太大，如果普及全国广大群众，那就要比全国发电厂所占用的良地要大得多，那就违背李富春副总理所说的土地节约的方针。须知我国原来有许多好的体育运动项目，譬如拿拳术和舞剑来说罢，外国的拳剑根本就更少脱离原始的斗击形式。而我国的拳剑种类之多、艺术品质之高，实为欧西的所望尘莫及。我认为好的民族形式体育运动项目值得大大提倡的。同时外来的东西应加以批判的采用，如有些游泳方法就可以大大的提倡发展。
    不要让劳卫制的推广陷于自流
    本来体育运动的目的是为人民健康和国家建设服务的，譬如为国防，就有国防体育运动项目（艺术家也应该有他们的项目）。因此我认为劳卫制形式是适合于这一个目的的，它是先进的科学的对身体是全面发展的，可以说在体育上是革命的。本来劳卫制在我国发展得相当好，而且收了好的效果，但由于去年在测验时，准备工作做得不够充分，以致出了极少数事故，引起了社会上的批评，如是从去年下半年起劳卫制形成了自流状态（当然也有些学校和单位受影响不大）。我认为这样情况是不妥的。当然劳卫制是要结合我国社会具体情况和人民的生活习惯来采用一些合理的项目，所以我建议体育运动应向具有民族风格的劳卫制方向发展。
    脑力劳动者都应该参加体育锻炼
    由于当前正处于国家社会主义建设高潮，人们忘我的劳动和学习是值得钦佩的，也是应当的，不过专偏重于工作和学习一方面，而不顾及到健康的另一方面，不去进行体育活动，往往不知不觉的把身体搞坏，因而造成早期衰老、或长期休养，这是对人才一种损失和浪费，对社会主义建设也会受到一定的影响。毛主席的三好号召是把身体好放在第一位，那就是告知我们在进行脑力劳动的同时，要进行体育活动，以免健康上受到不应有的损失。譬如伟大作家托尔斯泰活到八十二岁还保持良好的健康和很强的工作能力。又如伟大科学家巴甫洛夫每日进行脑力劳动十二小时之多，而且工作效率很高，他一生差不多没有病，他一直维持强度的工作量到晚年，他很健康的愉快的活到八十七岁。这两位学者其所以能做到这样是由于他们把脑力劳动和体育活动同卫生生活制度结合得很好的原故。又最近新体育杂志记载了一位张全老先生的生活情况，由于他一生经常进行体力劳动或体育活动，现在已经一百二十岁了，仍然很健康。因此我认为今日我国脑力劳动者能够很方便的，得到应有的体育活动问题，是成了当前一个迫切重要问题，是值得我们研究的，也是我们每个脑力劳动者应当去争取的。
    体育运动要为中老年人的健康着想
    我国人民由于受了历代统治阶级和近百年来帝国主义的沉重剥削和压迫，摧残了人民的体质，这是我国人民最大痛心事之一。解放以来由于毛主席的“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”号召之下，又由于党和政府大力提倡体育运动，人民的体育运动和健康已有了很大的进步。仅上海一地，人民进行有组织的男女运动员就有七十一万多人，这样宏大体育组织在我国是空前的，在资本主义世界恐怕也没有过。惟可惜美中不足，这一切活动极少中老年参加（中老年妇女则更少）；由于中老（男女）年人年龄关系，不宜进行一般激烈运动，只能做轻松柔软活动，但是没有这种准备。本来体育工作者应当安排中老年人体育活动问题，和宣传工作，无奈他们还没有注意到这一问题，甚至根本就没有从体育上为中老年人的健康着想。党和政府对中老年人的生活照顾无微不至（尤其对老年人的照顾好），所以我很恳切的盼望体育工作者能贯彻党和政府这一方针。那不仅是中老年人之福，而且对国家维护已经成熟的人才和社会主义建设事业都有很大的贡献。
    我为什么要特别强调中老年人的体育运动呢？是因为今日中老年人的体育运动是社会主义建设事业中最弱的一环，他们又是人民当中最大的群众。此外，今日在座的绝大多数都是这个年龄，并且都是进行辛勤脑力劳动者，而缺乏体育活动，因此我们是需要向体育进军，来保证我们的健康，庶几能更好更多更长期的为人类社会服务。以上不成熟意见敬请各位批评。
