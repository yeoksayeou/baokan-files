We would like to share some of our experiences in the work of the Fuzhou Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).

In 1956, the work of the Fuzhou Municipal CPPCC made significant progress, expanding the scope of unity. In particular, the Third Plenary Session invited 229 people from all walks of life to attend as observers and added 31 new members to the committee. After the meeting, the various special working groups were expanded and strengthened. Ten working groups were established, including industry and commerce, literature and art, liberation of Taiwan, medicine and health, municipal construction, politics and law, democratic parties, overseas Chinese affairs, religion, and education. These groups carried out regular activities, with a total of 262 members participating in the working groups. More than 5,000 people from all walks of life and industrialists and merchants were widely organized to study political theory and current affairs policies. Furthermore, more than 1,000 people from various social strata were contacted to promote visits and inspections, and various symposiums, report meetings, tea parties, and lectures were held. Through this work, more than 1,000 opinions and suggestions from people of all walks of life were reflected, strengthening the ties between the Party and the government and the people. This has promoted the work of the people's democratic united front.

From the perspective of the CPPCC's organizational members, it broadly unites various democratic parties, people's organizations, social strata, ethnic minorities, and other patriotic democratic personages. However, the working body of the CPPCC consists of only a few full-time staff members. How can such a small number of subjective forces play a role in the vast society? This requires considering how to mobilize all positive factors. Judging from several specific tasks in Fuzhou City, certain achievements have been made in mobilizing all positive factors to leverage the role of the united front.

In contacting and organizing social personages for study, we have fully implemented the principle of mobilizing all positive factors. Generally speaking, most social personages do not have formal employment and are scattered throughout society. Some are older, and some are ideologically backward. Before the CPPCC contacted and organized them for study, some people often had some complaints during political movements or central tasks, or at least did not promote the movements or central tasks with a positive attitude. They themselves also had a serious sense of inferiority, believing that the government had no use for these "outdated" people. Under these circumstances, initial contact was difficult. How did we carry out this work? First, we needed to understand the situation. The CPPCC itself lacked manpower, so we mobilized some full-time cadres from various democratic parties to spend some time conducting surveys and visits in various districts and residential committees. As long as they were middle and upper-class personages without fixed jobs scattered in society, such as painters, doctors, engineers, educators, and middle and upper-class figures among former military and government personnel, they were all targets for contact. After a period of work, we initially clarified the situation. The second step was to further develop contacts after consultation with the various democratic parties, based on different characteristics. For example, former military and government personnel were contacted by the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), medical and health personnel and people in science and technology by the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party (CPWDP), literary and educational figures by the China Democratic League (CDL), and industrialists and merchants by the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA). After another round of contact and visits by each party, they established preliminary relationships with them. Various forms of symposiums and tea parties were also held. Some social personages who participated in the symposiums convened by the democratic parties felt that someone was already contacting and uniting them, and they were no longer being ignored. Therefore, they felt that although they were older, the government still cared about them. On this basis, some people voluntarily requested to study and improve their understanding. Therefore, our third step was to organize them for study. The CPPCC established a sub-committee for the study of social personages, but social personages from various departments were still responsible for hosting their study work by the various contacted parties. In recent months, they have studied important current affairs policies of various periods, such as the "Eighth National Congress" documents, "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat," and "Basic Questions of the Chinese Revolution." Through such contact and organization of study, they expressed that they were no longer "bitter plums by the roadside." For example, CPPCC Vice Chairman Xu Xianshi visited a social personage who said, "If you visit me a few more times, I can live a few more years." An old engineer also said that he used to walk away when he heard people talking about current affairs, partly because he didn't understand them and partly because he was afraid of being asked questions. Now, through study, he takes the initiative to join in when others talk about current affairs and can also express his own opinions. He feels that he has something to contribute. Many elderly gentlemen have also expressed their willingness to "extend their years to serve the country diligently." These examples fully illustrate that we have made certain achievements in contacting and organizing social personages for study, and the development of this work is entirely in line with the correct principle of mobilizing all positive factors.

In organizing the study of democratic personages from all walks of life, we have also mobilized positive factors from all aspects. For example, the study of industry and commerce circles fully utilizes the strength of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC) and the CNDCA. The study of social personages utilizes the strength of the RCCK, the study of medical and health circles utilizes the strength of the CPWDP, and the study of overseas Chinese and religious circles utilizes the strength of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese (ACFROC) and the religious circles themselves, and so on. They selected representative figures to participate in the various study committee sub-committees organized by the CPPCC to jointly lead the study of all circles. We have also opened amateur political schools, which are also divided into classes based on different characteristics, such as industry and commerce, and medicine and health circles. Cadres are drawn from various democratic parties to take on the work of class teachers. By doing so, we have mobilized the strength of all relevant parties and strengthened the work of the CPPCC. On the other hand, through the activities of the CPPCC, the content of the work of the relevant units themselves is enriched. In general, all positive factors are mobilized, and the work of the people's democratic united front is strengthened.

The Fuzhou Municipal CPPCC also mobilized positive factors from all aspects in the working groups to carry out work. For example, in September of last year, the Working Group for the Liberation of Taiwan convened a city-wide symposium of family members of military and government personnel in Taiwan to promote and educate on the policy of peaceful liberation of Taiwan, encouraging them to take action and participate in the struggle for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan in various ways. Through this meeting, many family members of Taiwan personnel were relieved of their ideological concerns and their ideological understanding was reversed. One family member of Taiwan personnel stated, "In the past, we were linked to anti-revolutionary families; now, we are on a par with the families of overseas Chinese." In practical terms, they wrote a total of 95 open letters and entrusted letters to Taiwan. The survey of the number of households of Taiwan personnel in the city has increased from 1,450 to 1,955. Prior to this, many family members of Taiwan military and government personnel were afraid to admit that they had relatives in Taiwan. The key to doing this work well is to rely on mobilizing the strength of all parties. For example, initially, when investigating the situation of Taiwan personnel's families, we cooperated with the district committees to hold meetings of street office directors and chiefs of public security police stations, mobilizing them to visit representative family members of Taiwan personnel, collect reflections, and then convene meetings of Taiwan personnel's families in various districts to conduct publicity, organize discussions, and select representatives for the city representative meeting. Then, the city representative meeting was convened, and after the meeting, it was organized for dissemination. A total of 33 meetings of various sizes were held, reaching 1,583 people. This work was mainly launched and relied on the backbone members of the Taiwan personnel's families and the representatives attending the meetings, using their own practical examples of ideological transformation to educate the masses they contacted, and the effect was even greater.

Through this work, we deeply realized that the development of CPPCC work must mobilize positive factors from all aspects and use all forces to further serve the role of the people's democratic united front. If this direction is lost, the CPPCC will become an empty shell and will not be able to fully play its due role in socialist construction. In mobilizing all positive factors, the relevant departments have played an active coordinating role, and the role of the democratic parties in particular is even more significant. Because the work of the democratic parties is completely consistent with the work of the CPPCC, the extensive development of the CPPCC work enriches the content of the activities of the democratic parties. Secondly, a link that cannot be ignored in mobilizing all positive factors is relying on the masses. For example, in contacting social personages to organize study and in the dissemination of the Taiwan family members' meeting, we have fully leveraged the strength of the masses themselves. Especially in the contact work with social personages, they used the method of "linking up," which quickly expanded the scope of contact, and the contact work was widely developed.

Of course, the development of CPPCC work relies more on the leadership and support of the Party and the government. For example, in the past year, we have reflected more than 1,000 opinions and suggestions from people from all walks of life, which were transferred to the relevant departments. Thanks to the importance attached by the Party and the government, all these opinions have been handled, and those that could not be done have also been responded to. This has ensured that all the opinions of the people have been addressed, which has encouraged everyone to put forward more opinions and suggestions, so that our socialist construction undertakings can be done more and better.

　　为调动一切积极因素而努力
　　汪盈科、宁家魁联合发言，谈福州市政协工作
    我们现在就福州市政协工作中的一些体会，来发表一点意见。
    1956年福州市政协工作有了很大的发展，扩大了团结面，尤其是第三次全体会议，邀请了各界人士二百二十九人列席，增补了委员三十一名，会后并扩大和充实了各个专门工作组。共设立了工商、文艺、解放台湾、医药卫生、市政建设、政法、民主党派、华侨、宗教、教育等十个工作组，经常开展了活动，参加工作组的组员共有二百六十二人，广泛组织了各界人士和工商业者五千余人进行了政治理论和时事政策的学习，并联系了各阶层社会人士一千多人，推动各界参观视察，召开了各种座谈会、报告会、茶话会和讲座。通过这些工作，反映了各界人民的意见和建议一千多条，密切了党和政府与人民群众之间的联系。推动了人民民主统一战线的工作。
    从政协组织的成员来说，它是广泛地团结了各个民主党派、各人民团体、各社会阶层、少数民族，以及其他爱国民主人士，但作为政协的工作机构，就只有极少数的几位专职工作人员，以这样极少数的主观力量，如何在广大的社会上发挥作用，这就需要如何来调动一切积极因素的问题了。以我们福州市的几件具体工作来看，关于调动一切积极因素，来发挥统一战线的作用是取得了一定的成绩。
    我们在联系和组织社会人士学习的工作上，就是充分地贯彻了调动一切积极因素的这个方针。一般说，社会人士大多是没有岗位工作，散处在社会上，有的年龄较大，有的思想较落后，在没有经过政协进行联系组织学习以前，往往在政治运动或中心工作中有些人多少总有一点牢骚，至少也不是以积极的态度来推动运动或中心工作。他们本身也存在严重的自卑感，认为政府对他们这些“过时”了的人，是用不着的了。在这种情况下，初期进行联系是有困难的，我们如何开展这一工作呢？首先是摸底，政协本身人手不够，我们发动了各民主党派的一部分专职干部，抽出一定时间，在各区、各居民委员会中，进行了一次调查访问，只要是散处在社会上的没有固定岗位工作的中上层人士如画家、医生、工程师、教育工作者，以及旧军政人员中的中上层分子等等，都是联系的对象，这样经过一段工作，初步摸清了情况，第二个步骤是经过与各个民主党派协商后，分别不同性质来进一步开展联系，如旧军政人员由民革联系，医药卫生、科技界人士由农工党联系，文艺、教育界人士由民盟联系，工商界人士由民建联系，各个党派经过再一次的联系访问后，与他们建立了初步的感情，接着还召开了各种形式的座谈会、茶话会等，有的社会人士参加了民主党派召开的座谈会，觉得已经有人来联系团结他，再不是没有人理睬的了，因而觉得虽然年纪大了，政府还是关心他们，在这个基础上就有人自动提出要求学习，要求提高认识，因此，我们第三个步骤就是组织他们进行学习，由政协成立了社会人士学委分会，但各个部门的社会人士仍然由各个联系的党派去负责主持他们的学习工作。几个月来他们学习了各个时期的重要时事政策，如“八大”文件，“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”，“中国革命基本问题”等，通过这样的联系和组织学习，他们表示已不是“道旁苦李”。例如政协许显时副主席去访问一位社会人士，他说：“你多访问几次，我可以多活几年”。一位老工程人员还说，他以前听到人家谈时事就走开，一方面是自己不懂，另一方面又怕有人问他，现在通过学习，别人谈时事，自己就主动地凑拢来，也可以发表自己的见解，自己感到已经有本钱了。不少老先生还表示愿“天假以年，为国精进”。这些事例，充分说明了我们在联系、组织社会人士学习工作中是有一定的成绩，而这项工作的开展，又完全是贯彻了调动一切积极因素的正确方针。
    我们在组织各界民主人士的学习中，同样也是调动了各方面的积极因素，如工商界的学习是完全调用了工商联和民建的力量，社会人士的学习，是调用了民革的力量，医药卫生界的学习是调用了农工党的力量，华侨、宗教界的学习是调用了侨联和宗教界的本身力量等等。由他们选出代表性的人物，参加政协组织的各个学委分会，共同领导各界的学习，我们还开办了业余政治学校，也是分别性质如工商、医药卫生界来编班，由各民主党派抽调干部负担班主任的工作，我们这样做，调动了各个有关方面的力量，加强了政协的工作。另一方面是通过政协的活动，充实了各有关单位本身的工作内容。而总的说来是调动了一切积极因素，加强了人民民主统一战线的工作。
    福州市政协在工作小组中也同样是调动了各方面的积极因素，来开展工作的。如解放台湾工作小组在去年9月间曾召开了一次全市性的台湾军政人员家属座谈会，对和平解放台湾的政策进行了宣传教育，推动他们行动起来，运用各种方式，参加和平解放台湾的斗争。通过这个会解除了许多台属的思想顾虑，扭转了他们的思想认识，有一个台属表示说：“过去我们是和反革命家属连根，现在我们是和华侨家属并列”了。表现在实际行动上他们写给台湾的公开信和转托信共计九十五封。而全市台属户数的调查，已由一千四百五十增加到一千九百五十五户，在此以前许多台湾军政人员家属是不敢承认有亲人在台湾的。而做好这件工作主要是依靠调动各方面的力量，例如最初在调查台属情况时，我们配合了各区委会开了街办主任、公安派出所所长会议，动员他们分头向有代表性的台属进行访问，收集反映，接着就在各区召开了台属会议，进行宣传，组织讨论，选出市代表会的代表，然后才召开市的代表会，会后并组织了传达。计召开大小会议三十三次，传达到一千五百八十三人。而这些工作，又主要是发动和依靠了台属中的骨干分子和出席会议的代表，以他们自己的思想转变的实际事例，来教育他们所联系的群众，效果就更大了。
    通过这些工作，我们深深地体会到政协工作的开展，必须要调动各方面的积极因素，运用一切力量，来进一步为发挥人民民主统一战线的作用而服务，如果失去了这个方向，政协就会成为一个空虚的架子，在社会主义建设中就不能充分发挥它应有的作用。在调动一切积极因素中，有关的各个部门是起了积极配合的作用，特别是民主党派的作用就更为显著。因为民主党派的工作与政协工作是完全一致的，政协工作的广泛开展，也就更丰富了民主党派的活动内容，其次在调动一切积极因素中不能忽略的一个环节是依靠群众，如我们在联系社会人士组织学习中，在台湾家属会议的传达工作中，都是充分发挥了群众本身的力量，特别是在社会人士联系工作上，他们运用了“串连”的方式，使联系面迅速地扩大，联系工作获得广泛的开展。
    当然政协工作的开展，更主要的还是依靠党、政府的领导和支持，例如我们在一年来反映了各界人民意见建议一千多条，转到各有关部门去，由于党和政府的重视，这些意见已全部做了处理，做不到的也有了答复，这样就做到对人民群众的意见，件件有着落，也就鼓励了大家更多地提出意见和建议，让我们的社会主义建设事业，做得更多更好。（附图片）
