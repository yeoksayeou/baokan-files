Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, March 4th: People of all nationalities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are actively supporting the construction of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway. As of March 1st, the autonomous region and nine banners and counties along the northern section of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, including Baotou and Urad Front Banner, had established support committees. Some leagues have assigned responsible cadres to lead the support work in various places. Commodity supply departments have established supply points in Gongmiaoz, Wuyuan, Sanshenggong and other places along the railway, supplying vegetables, rice, flour, cooking oil and daily necessities to the railway engineering troops and laborers building the road.

The labor teams supporting the railway construction are harvesting more than 10 million catties of firewood and weaving more than 60,000 willow mats for the railway soldiers to use for road construction and house building. In addition, farmers and herdsmen have also supplied locally produced vegetables and meat products to the road builders.

To reduce the difficulty of the road construction project, farmers in the Hetao area have rerouted and rebuilt the Fuxing and other four major canals that the railway passes through. This project involves a total of more than 1.6 million cubic meters of earthwork, and more than 3,000 Mongolian and Han laborers have completed the rerouting and rebuilding of 500,000 cubic meters of earthwork. In the E Tuoke grassland and Bayannur League, where transportation is difficult, herdsmen will organize camel transportation teams to provide support. The Inner Mongolia Yellow River Navigation Bureau also plans to allocate some civilian ships to undertake transportation work along the railway from Baotou to Shanba, Dengkou and other places.

    内蒙古各族人民支援包兰铁路建设
    新华社包头4日电  内蒙古自治区各族人民积极支援包兰铁路的建设。到3月1日，自治区和包兰铁路北段沿线的包头、乌拉特前旗等九个旗县均已成立了支援委员会。有些盟都指派负责干部前往各地领导支援工作。商品供应部门在铁路经过的公庙子、五原、三盛公等地建立了供应点，向筑路的铁道兵部队和民工供应蔬菜、米面、食油和日用百货。
    支援铁路建设的民工队正在收割一千多万斤柴草，编织六万多片柳菩供应铁道兵们修路盖房用。此外农牧民们还向筑路者供应了当地出产的蔬菜和肉食品。
    河套地区的农民，为减少筑路工程的困难，将铁路经过的复兴等四大干渠改线重修。此项工程共达一百六十多万土方，目前已有三千多蒙汉民工完成了五十万土方的改线重修工程。在交通困难的鄂托克草原和巴彦淖尔盟的牧民们，将组织骆驼运输队前往支援。内蒙古黄河航运局并拟调拨一部分民船担任包头至陕坝、磴口等地铁路沿线的运输工作。
