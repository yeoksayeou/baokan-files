Materials from Beijing hospitals in the second half of last year indicated that induced abortion is very harmful to women's health and should be appropriately restricted. We must vigorously promote knowledge of contraception and advocate late marriage.

Now I would like to offer some opinions on the issue of birth control.

Since the Ministry of Health relaxed the restrictions on induced abortion last year, the number of induced abortions in Beijing hospitals has risen sharply. According to the situation in the second half of 1956:

    (1) In the second half of 1956, 1,593 induced abortions were performed in twenty-four municipal hospitals in Beijing.

    (2) The average hospital stay for induced abortion is five days per person (generally three to five days, up to seven days). Assuming four people per bed per month, 66.3 beds were occupied by people having induced abortions for half a year. Given that there are 619 gynecological beds in the twenty-four hospitals in Beijing, 66.3 beds account for 10.6% of the total number of beds. Among the 619 beds, there are also some obstetrical beds, because some hospitals do not separate obstetrics and gynecology. This means that people having induced abortions are occupying some of the beds that should be used for normal childbirth.

    (3) Each induced abortion requires three doctors, and the surgeon must be an experienced attending physician. Another doctor administers anesthesia, and another measures blood pressure and pulse. For 1,593 people, 4,779 doctors are needed to perform this surgery.

    (4) Each induced abortion surgery takes 15 to 30 minutes. If we calculate it at 15 minutes, 4,779 doctors would need 1,194 hours. Assuming eight hours a day, this totals 149 working days. If one doctor were to do it, it would take almost seven and a half months.

    (5) The surgical fee for each induced abortion is 15 to 30 yuan, and the hospitalization fee is 2 yuan per day, totaling 10 yuan for five days. Even at the lowest cost, each induced abortion costs 25 yuan per person. For 1,593 people, the total cost is 39,825 yuan.

The above situation shows that induced abortion wastes state resources, causes hospital bed congestion, and keeps doctors busy and flustered.

Secondly, we know that induced abortion does more harm than good. Even very experienced doctors cannot guarantee that problems will not arise. For example, Beijing Tongren Hospital sent follow-up letters to 61 people who had induced abortions (including those who had surgery in 1955 and 1956). Thirty people responded. Among these thirty people: two had unexplained massive bleeding and went into shock; three had a second surgery because the first one was not completely cleaned; three had pelvic inflammatory disease; and one had irregular menstruation. This means that nine out of thirty people had adverse consequences. In addition, in the outpatient department, I met one person who had a habitual abortion due to induced abortion and was seeking treatment; two people were infertile due to induced abortion and were seeking treatment to become pregnant. These facts tell us how serious the harm of induced abortion is to women's health.

Based on the above, I believe:

    1. We must vigorously carry out publicity and guidance work on contraception knowledge. We have also done some publicity work in the past two years, but it is far from enough for only the health departments and women's federations to do it. It is not realistic to think that contraception is only a matter for women. Chairman Mao said that a special agency should be established to study and guide this work. I very much agree. I hope that this agency will include the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, the Trade Union, the Communist Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, the China Association for Science and Technology, the All-China Women's Federation, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Health, the Chinese Medical Association, and the Red Cross Society, to jointly take responsibility. At present, we should focus on educating young and middle-aged men, so that they can correctly treat the issue of contraception. When publicizing, we should not only start from the individual's interests, but also combine it with the overall and long-term interests of the country. If a young person marries too early and has too many children, it will not only affect their own work, study and life, but also affect the rapid completion of national economic construction and the gradual improvement of people's lives. Contraception technical guidance used to be attached only to the obstetrics and gynecology outpatient department, unilaterally providing technical guidance to women, causing women to encounter difficulties. In the future, a special agency should be established to provide technical guidance to men at the same time.

    2. Promoting contraception while not changing the early marriage system is putting the cart before the horse. As everyone knows, since the promulgation of the Marriage Law, many young people marry as soon as they turn eighteen, and some are not even fully eighteen years old, marrying at sixteen or seventeen, which is too early. Therefore, I believe that on the one hand, we should create public opinion in society and create a new atmosphere of advocating late marriage and opposing early marriage, and conduct ideological education for young men and women; at the same time, we should consider postponing the marriage age in the Marriage Law. Not only that, but some young people now one-sidedly understand the happy life of socialism and are overly concerned about their marriage problems, especially in secondary schools, which has a very bad influence. Therefore, I suggest that secondary school students should be prohibited from marrying.

    3. Sterilization and induced abortion should be a supplementary method to actively promoting contraception and taking contraceptive measures, and should not be done unless absolutely necessary. It was certainly not good to have too strict restrictions in the past, but if there are no restrictions now, I am afraid that not only will it not achieve the purpose of active contraception, but it will also make people casually have sterilization and induced abortion, which is unimaginable for the harm to people's health. I believe that birth control is to promote that people should have planned births, not to tell people not to have children. Therefore, sterilization should never be done casually, and the same goes for men. Generally, young men and women under the age of 30 should not have sterilization too early unless they are in poor health and have too many children who are still very young. As for the harm of induced abortion to women's health, it should be given top priority and must be paid attention to. Induced abortion cannot be decided solely on the grounds of hindering work and study, but should be decided on the basis of physical health conditions, and administrative considerations and guidance should also be given comprehensively. The hospitalization and surgical costs of induced abortion should be entirely self-funded, which can save the state's overspending on public medical care every year, and also prompt people to actively practice contraception.

    非不得已不要做人工流产
    李健生的发言
    去年下半年北京市各医院的材料说明：人工流产对妇女健康有很大损害，应加以适当限制。要大力宣传节育知识，提倡迟婚。
    现在我想就节制生育问题提出一点意见。
    自从去年卫生部放宽了人工流产的限制后，北京市各医院人工流产的数字直线上升，以1956年下半年的情况来看：
      （1）1956年下半年北京市二十四个市立医院中共做人工流产一千五百九十三人。
      （2）人工流产住院每人平均五天（一般住院三天至五天，多的到七天），每床每月住四人计算，要六十六点三张床半年的时间都住了人工流产的人。按北京市二十四个医院妇科病床共六百十九张，六十六点三张床就占了总床数的10.6％；在六百十九张床位中，还包括一部分产科床位，因为有的医院是产科妇科没有分开的，这也就是说人工流产的人占了一部分正常产应该住院生产的床位。
      （3）做人工流产每次需要三个大夫，做手术的还要有经验的主治医师，另一个上麻药，一个量血压脉搏。一千五百九十三人就需要四千七百七十九个大夫做此手术。
      （4）人工流产手术每次需要十五分钟至三十分钟，就以十五分钟计算，四千七百七十九个大夫就需要一千一百九十四小时，按一天八小时计算，合计一百四十九个工作日，假使一个大夫做，要做差不多七个半月。
      （5）人工流产手术费每次十五元至三十元，住院费每日二元，五天共计十元，即以最低费用计算，每人每次人工流产共需费用二十五元。一千五百九十三人合计需人民币三万九千八百二十五元。
    以上情况，说明人工流产浪费国家财力，造成医院病床拥挤和大夫的忙乱。
    其次我们知道，人工流产是害多益少的，即使很有经验的大夫，也不能保证不出问题。例如北京市同仁医院发信追踪六十一个人工流产的人（其中55年手术与56年手术者均有），有三十人给了回信，在这三十人中：二人无原因大出血，休克；三人因第一次未刮干净，又作了第二次手术；三人有盆腔炎；一人月经不调。这就是说三十人中，有不良后果的九人。另外在门诊部遇到一人，因做人工流产造成习惯性流产，要求治疗；二人因做人工流产造成不孕，要求治疗能怀孕。这些事实告诉我们人工流产对于妇女身体健康的危害是多么严重。
    根据以上情况，我认为：
    一、必须大力开展关于节育知识的宣传指导工作。近二年来我们也做了一些宣传工作，但只是卫生部门和妇联来做是大大不够的，把节育认为是妇女一方面的事是不符合实际情况的。毛主席说要成立一个专门机构来研究和指导，我非常赞成，希望这个机构包括中共中央宣传部、工会、青年团、青联、学联、科普、妇联、财政部、商业部、轻工业部、卫生部和中华医学会、红十字会等，共同来负责。当前首先应重点向青年和中年男同志进行教育，使他们正确地对待节育问题。宣传的时候，不仅从个人的利益出发，也要和国家的整体利益与长远利益结合起来谈。一个青年，过早结婚，过多生子女，不仅影响自己的工作、学习和生活，同时也会影响到国家经济建设的迅速完成和人民生活的逐步改善。避孕技术指导，过去只附设在妇产科门诊部，片面地对妇女进行技术指导，造成妇女发生困难的情况，今后应设立专门机构，同时对男子进行技术指导。
    二、一面提倡节育，一面不改变早婚制度，这是舍本而求末。大家知道，自从婚姻法颁布以来，很多青年刚刚满十八岁就结婚，有的还不是十足年龄，大概十六、七岁就结婚了，这未免太早婚了。因此我认为一方面应在社会上造成舆论，掀起提倡迟婚，反对早婚的新风气，对青年男女进行思想教育；同时是否可以考虑将婚姻法上的结婚年龄推迟一些。不仅如此，现在有些青年，片面地理解社会主义的幸福生活，过早地关心自己的婚姻问题，特别在中等学校中，是有很不好的影响，所以我建议：中等学校学生，是否可以禁止结婚。
    三、绝育手术和人工流产应该是在积极提倡节育、采取避孕措施中的一种辅助办法，非万不得已不做。过去限制太严固然不好，现在若是毫无限制，恐怕不仅不能达到积极避孕的目的，反而会使人随便做绝育手术和人工流产，这对于人民健康的危害是不堪设想的。我认为节制生育是提倡人们应该有计划的生育，而不是叫人不生孩子，因此绝育手术绝不可以随便做，男子也是一样，一般三十岁以下的青年男女，假使不是身体不好，孩子不是太多还很小的时候，是不应该过早做绝育手术的。至于人工流产对于妇女身体健康的危害性应该提到首要地位，必须加以注意。做人工流产，不能单以妨害工作和学习为借口，而要以身体健康的条件作决定，一般仍应遵照医师的指导，行政上也要给予全面的考虑和指导。人工流产的住院和手术费用，应该完全自费，这样一来可以节省国家每年超支的公费医疗，同时也可促使人们积极去避孕。（附图片）
