Xinhua News Agency, 27th: With the rapid development of the agricultural cooperative movement, the important role of rural women on the agricultural production front has become more fully apparent in various regions.

Following the high tide of agricultural cooperation last year, rural women's enthusiasm for participating in production has soared to unprecedented levels. The number of women participating in agricultural production in various regions has increased significantly compared to the past. In Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, Henan, Hunan and other provinces, the number of women participating in production generally accounts for about 80% of the female labor force, while in Guizhou Province it accounts for more than 90%. In Xiangtan and Ningxiang counties, Hunan Province, the number of women participating in production last year increased more than twofold compared to 1955.

Women are very active and enthusiastic in various agricultural production activities. In Hebei, Hubei, Shaanxi and other places, the attendance rate of women during the busy farming season accounts for more than 80%. The female members of the Hugjiletu Agricultural and Pastoral Cooperative in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are responsible for nearly a thousand sheep in the entire cooperative, enabling the survival rate of lambs to reach more than 95%. Many women have learned to master new technologies in production, and the production items that women can participate in have greatly increased compared to the past. According to statistics from thirty-one counties in Zhejiang Province, more than 9,000 women have learned to use double-wheeled double-shared plows, more than 90,000 women have learned to use rice threshers, and many women have also learned to master water pumps.

Rural women in various regions also actively carry out sideline production activities such as twisting hemp rope, weaving straw hats, making hemp shoes, spinning thread, raising pigs, and raising chickens, based on their own physical strength and varying conditions of household chores. The number of sideline production projects undertaken by women in Yanling County, Henan Province, has expanded to thirty-eight. Because women actively participate in sideline production, the sideline income of cooperatives has increased significantly. In the Bayi Advanced Cooperative in Xinjin County, Sichuan Province, the value created by women in household sideline income this year accounts for 96% of the total household sideline income.

Because women actively participated in agricultural and sideline production, last year a female laborer generally worked more than one hundred workdays, and many worked more than two hundred.

    农村妇女积极热情参加生产活动
    据新华社27日讯  随着农业合作化运动的迅速发展，各地农村妇女在农业生产战线上的重要作用更加充分地显示出来。
    在去年农业合作化高潮以后，农村妇女参加生产的热情空前高涨。各地妇女参加农业生产的人数较前有了显著增加。黑龙江、浙江、河南、湖南等地参加生产的妇女一般占妇女劳动力的80％左右，贵州省占90％以上。湖南省湘潭、宁乡两县去年参加生产的妇女比1955年增加二倍多。
    妇女们在各项农业生产活动中都很积极热情。河北、湖北、陕西等地在农忙季节妇女的出勤率都占80％以上。内蒙古自治区呼格基勒图农牧业合作社的女社员包管了全社近千只羊，使羊羔的成活率达到95％以上。许多妇女在生产中都学会掌握新技术，妇女所能参加的生产项目比过去大大增多。据浙江省三十一个县的统计，有九千多名妇女学会了使用双轮双铧犁，有九万多名妇女学会使用打稻机，还有不少妇女学会掌握抽水机。
    各地农村妇女还根据自己的体力、家务繁忙等不同条件，积极开展打麻绳、编草帽、作麻鞋、纺线、养猪、养鸡等副业生产活动。河南省鄢陵县妇女所从事的副业生产项目已扩大到三十八种。由于妇女积极参加副业生产，使合作社的副业收入增加很多。四川省新津县八一高级社今年家庭副业收入中妇女所创造的价值占全部家庭副业收入的96％。
    由于妇女积极参加了农、副业生产，去年一个女劳动力一般都做了一百个以上的劳动日，多的做到二百个以上。
