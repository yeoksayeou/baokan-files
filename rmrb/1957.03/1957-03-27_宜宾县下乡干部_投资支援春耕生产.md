　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 24th. More than 200 government cadres in Yibin County, Sichuan Province, who are working in the countryside, have recently invested more than 10,000 yuan in agricultural producers' cooperatives to support farmers' spring ploughing production.
　　Most of these cadres were sent to work in rural areas on a long-term basis two months ago, and they have established close relationships with the farmers. Recently, when many agricultural cooperatives were raising funds to expand production this year, they voluntarily invested their surplus money in the agricultural cooperatives where they were stationed. This action has greatly encouraged cooperative cadres and members.

　  投资支援春耕生产
    据新华社成都24日讯　四川省宜宾县二百多个下乡工作的机关干部，最近向农业生产合作社投资一万多元，支援农民春耕生产。
    这些干部大都是在两个月前被派到农村长期工作的，他们已和农民建立了亲密的感情。最近，当许多农业社筹集今年扩大生产的资金时，他们就自动地把积余的钱向驻在的农业社投资。这一行动，对合作社干部和社员的鼓舞很大。
