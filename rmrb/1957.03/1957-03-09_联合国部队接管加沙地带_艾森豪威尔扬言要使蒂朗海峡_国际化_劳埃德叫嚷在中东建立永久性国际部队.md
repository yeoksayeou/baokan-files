Xinhua News Agency, March 8th: Cairo – UN Emergency Force Commander Burns reported to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 7th that the UN Emergency Force had completed taking over the work of the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip according to plan, and he had established his mobile headquarters in Gaza City.

Burns issued a notice to the residents of the Gaza Strip on the 7th, stating that the UN Emergency Force would be responsible for the civil administration of the Gaza Strip until further arrangements were made. He announced that the curfew implemented in this area would continue to be maintained.

Xinhua News Agency, March 8th: Washington – US President Eisenhower said at a press conference on the 7th that the United States is prepared to announce with other major shipping countries that the Strait of Tiran is an open international waterway and to use it as such. He said that the US government believes this strait is an international waterway unless the International Court of Justice makes a contrary decision.

Eisenhower expressed satisfaction with the Senate's passage of his Middle East plan, believing that although the government's proposal had been amended, what the Senate passed was actually what the government requested.

Xinhua News Agency, March 8th: Jerusalem, Israeli District – Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion held talks with US Ambassador to Israel Lawson on the 7th.

According to United Press International, Ben-Gurion handed Lawson a reply letter from Israel to Eisenhower during the meeting. A senior official said that in Ben-Gurion's long letter to Eisenhower, he mentioned "some issues on which agreements should be reached" after Israel's withdrawal.

At the same time, Israeli Foreign Ministry officials said that they were "very satisfied" with a sentence spoken by President Eisenhower at a press conference in Washington on the 7th: the United States is prepared to declare the Strait of Tiran – the entrance to the Gulf of Aqaba – an international waterway and use it as such.

Xinhua News Agency, March 8th: London – British Foreign Secretary Lloyd expressed support for the establishment of a permanent international force in the Middle East during a radio broadcast press conference on the evening of the 7th.

Lloyd believes that there should be a sufficient number of "international police" to "maintain" peace between Israel and the Arabs. He hopes that this international force can "go beyond the borders of Israel and Egypt" and that its strength can be "strengthened as necessary." He believes that the current situation of the UN Emergency Force carrying out its mission is a test for establishing such a permanent international force.

    联合国部队接管加沙地带
    艾森豪威尔扬言要使蒂朗海峡“国际化”  劳埃德叫嚷在中东建立永久性国际部队
    据新华社8日讯　开罗消息：联合国紧急部队司令伯恩斯7日向联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德报告说，联合国紧急部队在加沙地带接替以色列军队的工作已经按计划完成，他已经在加沙城内建立了他的行军司令部。
    伯恩斯7日向加沙地带的居民发表公告说，在作出进一步的安排以前，加沙地带的民政工作将由联合国紧急部队负责。他宣布，在这个地带实施的宵禁将继续保持。
    据新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔7日在记者招待会上说，美国准备同其他的主要海运国家宣布蒂朗海峡是一条开放的国际水道，并且就这样使用它。他说，美国政府认为这个海峡是国际水道，除非国际法院作出相反的决定。
    艾森豪威尔对参议院通过了他的中东计划表示满意，认为政府的提案虽然经过修改，但是参议院通过的实际上也就是政府要求的东西。
    据新华社8日讯　耶路撒冷以色列区消息：以色列总理本—古里安7日同美国驻以色列大使劳逊举行了会谈。
    据合众社报道，本—古里安在接见劳逊时，把以色列给艾森豪威尔的复信交给了劳逊。一位高级人士说，本—古里安在写给艾森豪威尔的长信中，提到在以色列撤退以后“应当取得协议的一些问题”。
    同时，以色列外交部人士说，他们对于艾森豪威尔总统7日在华盛顿的一次记者招待会上所说的一句话感到“非常满意”，这句话是：美国准备宣布蒂朗海峡—亚喀巴湾的入口处——为国际水道，并且把它当作国际水道来使用。
    据新华社8日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交大臣劳埃德7日晚上在无线电广播记者招待会上表示赞成在中东建立一支永久性的国际部队。
    劳埃德认为应当有足够数目的“国际警察”来“维持”以色列阿拉伯之间的和平。他希望这支国际部队能够“越出以色列和埃及的国界”，并且使它的力量“得到必要的加强”。他认为现在联合国紧急部队执行任务的情况是建立这种永久性国际部队的一种试验。
