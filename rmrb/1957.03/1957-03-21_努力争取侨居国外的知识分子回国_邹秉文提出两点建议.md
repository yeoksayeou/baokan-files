Striving to Attract Intellectuals Residing Abroad to Return Home
　　Zou Bingwen Proposes Two Suggestions
　　I returned to the motherland from abroad six months ago. Naturally, I am far less familiar with the domestic situation than all of you. Regarding all aspects of the domestic situation, I need to learn from you and ask for your guidance.
　　I have two things to discuss today: one is the issue of attracting Chinese intellectuals residing abroad to return home, and the other is the issue of increasing agricultural production.
　　(I) Our country is undergoing large-scale economic construction and needs talent in all fields. In order to pool the wisdom and efforts of everyone to build our motherland into a more prosperous and beautiful country, we hope that we will do our best to attract our Chinese intellectuals residing abroad to return home to work. I have resided in the United States for nearly eight years recently and am relatively familiar with the situation of students studying in the United States. Roughly speaking, there are nearly four thousand intellectuals residing in the United States. A very small number of them are professors, associate professors, assistant professors, and teaching assistants at well-known American universities, and some are engineers and technicians in various factories, but most of them are not using what they have learned or their talents. Although the number of students returning from Europe and the United States in the past three years is not large, it is increasing year by year. For example, there were 63 in 1954, 133 in 1955, and in 1956, it increased to 161. Among them, 104 were from the United States. There are currently at least 4,000 students studying in the United States. Among them, about 200 are studying agriculture. Among the 800 people present today, many have relatives or friends studying or working abroad. I believe we should fulfill our responsibility and strive for their early return to the motherland. There are two ways to strive for this. First, communicate with them more, and tell them in detail about the rapid progress of construction in the motherland. If there are reports on this aspect in the newspapers, it is best to cut them out and send them with the letter, because these situations are what people residing abroad are most happy to know. What people residing abroad feel most painful about now is that they are too isolated from all aspects of the motherland. I have a friend residing in the United States who is a famous electrical engineer. Last spring, he sincerely said to me: The various advances in the motherland's industry are unbelievable. As far as he knows, our country could not even manufacture a nail before liberation. How can it now manufacture various large and complex machines? Another very patriotic and promising doctor of chemical engineering painfully told me in June last year: Every time a classmate returns home, he respectfully invites him to a meal and asks him to write a letter after returning home to report on the domestic situation; however, these friends never write letters after returning home, leaving me still hesitant and at a loss. Judging from the above facts, anyone who has friends abroad, especially those who have just returned from abroad, should regularly tell their friends abroad about all aspects of the motherland. We should not only write letters introducing all aspects of the motherland, but also, if foreign friends have unclear understanding of the domestic situation, we should provide detailed explanations. Second, do a good job of preparing for their return home, such as arranging work issues and necessary conditions for work and life in advance. On the one hand, contact them about these issues before they return home; on the other hand, allow them to directly settle their families near their service locations as soon as they arrive in the country, and at the same time, they can start working as soon as possible. Among the returned students, some have to wait for several months to get a job, and some cannot find a place to live after getting a job. These situations require us to help the government find ways to overcome them, so as to attract more intellectuals abroad to return home as soon as possible and serve the great construction of the motherland together.
　　(II) Attracting intellectuals abroad to return home is naturally to promote the large-scale economic construction of the motherland, and the issue of increasing agricultural production is the most important part of the economic construction. We have successively heard reports from Vice Premier Chen Yun, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and Vice Premier Deng Zihui, who have all given very detailed instructions on the issue of increasing agricultural production, which has given us a better understanding of this issue. To this end, I hope that we will focus on the following issues when we inspect various provinces every year:
　　1. Water conservancy issues. Increasing agricultural production mainly relies on proper irrigation. Currently, 500 million mu of the country's 1.6 billion mu of farmland are paddy fields and irrigated fields. I hope that we will focus on understanding the situation of the increase in the number of mu of paddy fields and irrigated fields in each province every year. If time permits, we can also go to the countryside to understand the progress of water conservancy.
　　2. Fertilizer issues. Whether the application of fertilizer is sufficient is one of the key issues in increasing agricultural production. Whether it is farm manure, green manure, mud fertilizer, or grass fertilizer, it should be applied. Chemical fertilizer should be actively applied. For example, in the Soviet Union's cotton fields, 130 jin of chemical fertilizer is applied per mu, so that the average cotton field can harvest 100 jin of seed cotton per mu, which is almost three times higher than the 33.1 jin of seed cotton per mu that can be harvested in our country. Currently, our country only uses 1 million tons of chemical fertilizer every year. Calculated based on 1.6 billion mu of farmland, an average of only 2 jin of chemical fertilizer can be used per mu, which cannot play an active role in increasing production. I fully support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's instruction that we can self-produce 35 million tons of chemical fertilizer every year when the fourth five-year plan is completed. I hope that we will focus on understanding the situation of fertilizer accumulation in farmland and the amount of chemical fertilizer that each province can self-manufacture and supply to farmers every year, so as to further plan agricultural production increase work.
　　3. Agricultural institution issues. In addition to the above two issues, we also need reasonable agricultural research, education, and extension institutions to increase agricultural production. At the same time, we also require these institutions to be equipped with appropriate talents, who should combine what they have learned with the valuable experience of the masses and advanced countries to study and solve all agricultural problems for farmers across the country. At present, the agricultural institutions in various provinces still inevitably have overlapping institutions, which should be improved. The recently established Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences has this major mission. I hope that we will focus on understanding the organizational situation of agricultural institutions in various provinces, and those whose work has achieved results should be commended.
　　4. Agricultural production cooperatives. Agricultural production cooperatives are the most important organization in our country to promote agricultural production increase. Currently, 96% of farmers in our country have joined cooperatives. Since the liberation seven years ago, the country's agriculture has been able to achieve great achievements, all thanks to the efforts of 500 million farmers. In the future, farmers across the country will give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity through production cooperatives. At the same time, with appropriate water conservancy, sufficient fertilizer, and various sound agricultural organizations working in concert, I believe that our country's twelve-year agricultural development plan can be completed ahead of schedule. I hope that we will focus on understanding the production situation of each cooperative, so that it will definitely play a role in promoting the further development of the cooperative. In short, agricultural production increase work is a long-term and extremely important task in our country. In order to support our country's accelerated industrialization, 500 million farmers across the country and comrades engaged in teaching, research, and extension work on the agricultural front are working day and night with their hard and selfless labor. The people of the country, especially the comrades of our CPPCC, have the responsibility to give their full support and help. To this end, I hope that we can spend part of our time studying the above issues when we inspect various provinces, so as to more effectively promote agricultural production increase and strive for the country's accelerated industrialization.

### 努力争取侨居国外的知识分子回国　邹秉文提出两点建议

    努力争取侨居国外的知识分子回国
　　邹秉文提出两点建议
    我是六个月前由国外回到祖国来的，对于国内情形，自然远不如诸位熟悉，不论国内那一方面的情况，我都要向诸位学习，并要求诸位指教。
    我今天所要谈的有两件事：一个是争取侨居国外的知识分子回国的问题；一个是农业增产问题。
      （一）我们国家正在进行大规模的经济建设，需要各方面的建设人才，为了群策群力，把祖国建设得更富强、更美好，就希望我们尽力争取侨居国外的我国知识分子回国工作。我最近在美国侨居了将近八年，对于美国留学生的情况，比较熟悉。大致知识分子侨居美国的，将近四千人。其中最少数人是美国著名大学的教授、副教授、助理教授和助教，有的是各工厂的工程师、技师，但大多数人都是学非所用，用非其才。最近三年来由欧美留学回国的，虽然不多，却是与年俱增的。例如1954年是六十三人，1955年一百三十三人，至1956年，就增到一百六十一人。其中来自美国的为一百零四人。现在侨美的留学生至少尚有四千人。其中学农的约有二百人。今天在座八百人中，有不少人是有一些亲友在国外留学或工作的。我认为我们要尽我们的责任，争取他们早日回国。争取的方法有两点。一是：多和他们通信，将祖国突飞猛进的建设情况，详尽地告诉他们，如报纸上有登载这一方面情况的，最好剪下来附在信内寄去，因为这些情况，都是侨居国外的人所最乐于了解的。现在侨居国外的人感到最苦痛的，就是对于祖国各方面的情况过于隔阂。我有一个侨居美国的友人是一个电气工程名工程师，去年春天曾诚恳地和我说：祖国工业上的各种进步，是难以置信的，据他所知，我国在解放前还不能自己制造一个钉子，现在怎能够自己制造各种大型而又复杂的机器呢？另有一个极爱国而又年青有为的化学工程博士，曾在去年6月间苦痛地告诉我：每次同学归国，都恭恭敬敬地请他吃一顿饭，求他回国后，写一封信来，报告国内情况；但是这些朋友回国以后，都从不写信来，使我至今尚徬徨不知所措。就以上这些事实看来，凡是在国外有朋友的人，尤其是新从国外回国的人，都应该经常将祖国各方面的情况，告诉给在国外的朋友。我们不但要写介绍祖国各方面情况的信，同时，国外友人如对国内情况，有不尽明了的地方，我们更要详细地给予解释。二是：作好争取他们回国前的准备工作，例如工作问题以及工作上和生活上的必要条件等等都要事先安排妥善。一方面，在他们回国以前就将这些问题和他们联系；一方面，使他们一抵国门，就可以先将眷属直接安置在接近服务处所的地方，同时本人也就可以尽早地开始工作。现在已经回国的留学生中，有的候至数月，才能得到工作，还有的在得到工作以后又找不到住处。这些情况，都需要我们帮助政府，设法予以克服，以便更多地争取在国外的知识分子早日回国，同为祖国的伟大建设服务。
      （二）争取在国外的知识分子回国自然是为了促进祖国的大规模经济建设，而农业增产问题更是经济建设事业中最重要的一环。我们曾先后听到陈云副总理、李富春副总理、邓子恢副总理所作的报告，对农业增产问题，都曾作了极详尽的指示，使我们对于这一问题有了更进一步地了解。为此，希望我们每年在到各省视察时着重地注意下列几个问题：
      1、水利问题。农业增产，主要依靠适当的灌溉，现在全国十六万万亩农田中，已有五万万亩是水田和灌溉田。我希望我们着重地了解各省每年水田和灌溉田增加亩数的情况，如时间许可，还可以到农村了解水利的进展情况。
    2、肥料问题。施用肥料是否充足，是农业增产中关键性问题之一，无论厩肥、绿肥、泥肥、草肥，固然应该施用，而化学肥料，更应该积极施用。例如苏联的棉田，每亩施用化肥一百三十斤，因而平均每亩棉田能收一百斤花衣，较之我国每亩只能收三十三点一斤花衣的几高三倍。现在我国每年只用化肥一百数十万吨，以农田十六万万亩计算，平均每亩只能用化肥二斤，自不能发挥积极增产的作用。我完全拥护李富春副总理所指示的在第四个五年计划完成时，每年能自产化肥三千五百万吨。我希望我们着重地了解农田积肥情况和各省每年能自造化肥和能供应农民化肥的数量，以便进一步地规划农业增产工作。
    3、农业机构问题。我们要求农业增产，除了上述两个问题外，还需要具有合理的农业研究、教育和推广机构，同时还要求在这些机构中，配备适当的人才，本其所学，结合群众和各先进国家的宝贵经验，以便为全国农民研究解决农业上的一切问题。现在各省的农业机构仍不免有机构重叠的情况，似应予以改进。最近成立的中国农业科学院就负有此项重大使命。我希望我们着重地了解各省农业机构的组织情况，其工作有成绩的，应给予表扬。
    4、农业生产合作社。农业生产合作社，是我国促进农业增产最重要的组织，现在我国96％的农民，都已加入了合作社。解放七年以来，全国农业所以能够获得巨大成就，全有赖于五亿农民的努力，今后全国农民通过生产合作社，更加发挥其积极性、创造性，同时，又有适当的水利、充足的肥料和各种健全的农业组织，相辅而行，我相信，我国农业十二年发展规划是可以提前完成的。我希望我们着重地了解各个合作社的生产情况，那末对于合作社的进一步发展，必能起其推动作用。总之农业增产工作是我国一个长远的极其重要的任务，为了支援我国加速工业化，全国五万万农民，和在农业战线上从事教学、研究和推广工作的同志们，正以其辛勤的忘我劳动，夜以继日地在工作着，全国人民，特别是我们政协的同志们，都有责任给以全力的支持和帮助。为此，我希望我们在到各省视察时能够分出一部分时间，对以上几个问题着重地加以研究，以便更有力促进农业增产，并为祖国的加速工业化而努力。
    以上意见，是否有当，敬请指教。（附图片）
