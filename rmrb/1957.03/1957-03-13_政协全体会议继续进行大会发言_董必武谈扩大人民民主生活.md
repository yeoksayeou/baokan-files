Xinhua News Agency, March 12th:

    The Third Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference continued this afternoon.
    Today is the 32nd anniversary of the death of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. At the beginning of the meeting, all participants, at the suggestion of Zhou Enlai, Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, stood up to pay tribute to this great revolutionary.
    After listening to the speech delivered by the Premier of the Czechoslovak Republic, Viliam Široký, at the invitation of the conference, the plenary session continued with plenary speeches.
    Dong Biwu, Vice Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and President of the Supreme People's Court, spoke today on several issues in the current political and legal work.
    Dong Biwu said that in the past year, China's People's Congress system has been further improved, and our country has also taken various appropriate measures to expand the people's democratic life in many ways. He said that practicing democracy internally among the people and exercising dictatorship over the enemy are two interconnected aspects of China's people's democratic dictatorship; the expansion of our country's democratic life is inseparable from the victory of our large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries throughout the country. Now that the period of revolutionary storms has passed, and the targets of dictatorship are gradually shrinking, however, counter-revolutionary elements have not been completely eliminated, and especially imperialists are attempting every day to inflict fatal damage on us from within, therefore, we must continue to maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and resolutely implement the policy of "counter-revolutionaries must be suppressed, mistakes must be corrected."
    Luo Yiqun, who had followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the revolution for many years, then spoke. He suggested to the CPPCC National Committee that a large-scale commemoration of Mr. Sun Yat-sen be held every ten years, and that two institutions, the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall and the Editorial Committee of the Complete Works of Sun Yat-sen, be established as soon as possible.
    Zhu Jisheng, manager of the Tianjin Flax and Silk Textile Company, talked about the changes in Tianjin's industrial and commercial circles over the past year and the current problems. He believes that industrialists and businessmen must be determined to intensify their studies and gradually achieve the goal of abolishing capitalism and establishing socialism through work practice.
    The 81-year-old painter Ke Huang said that from the old era to the new era, what he had heard and seen was both infinite pain and sorrow, and infinite joy and excitement, as if he was in two different worlds.
    Liang Hulu, a member of the CPPCC Guangxi Provincial Committee attending the meeting as an observer, suggested the early establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. He believes that establishing Guangxi Province as the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is an appropriate and necessary measure to implement the national policy.
    Xiong Bingkun, a veteran of the Wuchang Uprising of the 1911 Revolution, suggested that the government interview, collect or build all historical relics related to the revolution as soon as possible.
    Huang Shaohong said that our judicial work is improving at a rapid pace, which is encouraging. He believes that to improve the shortcomings of judicial work, the most basic task is how to give full play to the excellent characteristics of our trial and procuratorial system. Huang Shaohong also explained the importance of the people's procuratorial work and expressed the hope that the criminal law would be promulgated as soon as possible and that the administrative disciplinary law would be formulated as soon as possible.
    Liu Wang Liming spoke on the issues related to the further education of senior primary school graduates and the future of young people. She put forward specific suggestions on how to set up spare-time schools and cultural remedial schools.
    Seven other people gave written speeches today.
    Wang Baoying, who attended the meeting as an observer, said that early marriage has adverse effects on study and work, and on physical development.
    Chen Xujing suggested that an institution should be established specifically to deal with or resolve the problems of the 1.5 million boat-dwelling residents in South China.
    Yu Zuobai, who attended the meeting as an observer, hoped that all Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan would strive to make contributions to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.
    Li Shoumin, Guo Gushi, Liu Yuankai, and Xu Xiaonong, four people from the CPPCC committees of several small cities in Shandong Province who attended the meeting as observers, gave a joint written speech today. They expressed their opinions on strengthening the study of social figures, correcting the waste of public medical care, continuing to implement the policy on overseas Chinese, and compiling the history of Chinese education.
    A total of fifteen people spoke in the afternoon. In the morning, the meeting held group discussions.
    The meeting will continue tomorrow.

    政协全国委员会副主席、最高人民法院院长董必武今天就目前政法工作的几个问题发言。
    董必武说，在过去的一年中，我国的人民代表大会制度有了进一步的健全，我们国家还采取各种适当的措施，多方面地扩大人民民主生活。他说，对人民内部实行民主和对敌人实行专政，是我国人民民主专政的相互结合的两个方面；我们国家民主生活的扩大是同我们在全国范围内大规模的肃反斗争的胜利分不开的。现在，革命的暴风雨时期已经过去，专政的对象日益缩小，但是，反革命分子还没有完全肃清，特别是帝国主义者天天企图从我们内部来给我们以致命的破坏，因此，我们必须继续保持高度的革命警惕，必须坚决贯彻“有反必肃，有错必纠”的方针。
    曾经追随孙中山先生革命多年的罗翼群接着发言。他向政协全国委员会建议：每隔十年举行一次规模较大的纪念孙中山先生的活动；早日成立孙中山先生纪念馆和中山全书编辑委员会两个机构。

    辛亥革命武昌首义老人熊秉坤，建议政府早日采访、收罗或修建一切有关革命的历史文物。
    黄绍竑说，我们的司法工作正以很快的速度改进，这是值得我们鼓舞的。他认为要改进司法工作的缺点，最基本的工作是如何发挥我们审判、检察制度的优良特点。黄绍竑还说明了人民检察工作的重要性，并希望早日颁布刑法，从速制定行政方面的惩戒法。
