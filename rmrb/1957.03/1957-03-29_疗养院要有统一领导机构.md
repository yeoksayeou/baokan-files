Sanatoriums Should Have a Unified Leadership Structure
　　Sun Sizhe
    Qingdao is a coastal city in our country with a good climate and pleasant scenery. People often come here for recuperation throughout the year. Therefore, some departments have established sanatoriums here. Now, the coastal area of Qingdao city has formed a sanatorium district.
    There are currently twelve sanatoriums in the sanatorium district, with a total of more than 2,000 beds. In recent years, most of the sanatoriums have admitted some patients. Due to the good natural conditions and certain medical equipment, many patients have been relieved of the pain of illness, recovered their health, and happily returned to their jobs. For example, the cure rate of the Qingdao Workers' Sanatorium (tuberculosis) is over 90%, and an average of more than 230 people are cured and discharged from the hospital every year.
    However, due to the lack of management experience and unified leadership in the sanatorium industry, there is an uneven distribution of workload among the sanatoriums, resulting in a low utilization rate. Some beds are even vacant for years, causing a great waste. This phenomenon is obviously not in line with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy.
    Among the dozen or so sanatoriums, except for three sanatoriums (Qingdao Workers, Textile, and Railway) whose bed utilization rate averages over 85% throughout the year, the other sanatoriums have higher utilization rates only in summer and autumn, and very low utilization rates in winter and spring. In particular, the Workers' Sanatorium of the Second Ministry of Machinery Industry and the Beijing Military Region Vacation Sanatorium have been built for two years, and more than 300 beds have not formally admitted vacationers. In the winter and spring seasons, the entire sanatorium area has an average of more than 900 vacant beds. If these vacant beds can be utilized, based on a recuperation period of three months per person, more than 2,000 additional patients can be admitted each year. This is a great potential.
    In addition to a certain number of beds, each sanatorium also has almost a full set of equipment and various auxiliary facilities. The entire district has five X-ray machines, five sanatoriums have physiotherapy departments or physiotherapy rooms, and six sanatoriums have auditoriums. As for general physiotherapy equipment, most sanatoriums have some. However, because each sanatorium is under the leadership of a vertical system, there is no connection between them, and there is no unified organization, so they cannot cooperate with each other in use and each has its own set. For example, the physiotherapy department of the Qingdao Sanatorium is large, but there are not many patients and the utilization rate is not high; while the Railway Sanatorium and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Sanatorium have many patients, but lack physiotherapy equipment and cannot do the medical treatment that should be done. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions Sanatorium and the Navy Sanatorium are located in the same area, but each has built a large auditorium, one on the south side of the road and one on the north side. If they could be used in a unified manner, one auditorium would be enough for the two sanatoriums.
    Because the sanatoriums are not under unified leadership, the waste of manpower is also very serious. In some sanatoriums, except for the summer, some staff members have nothing to do in the autumn, winter, and spring seasons. There are also two vacation sanatoriums that have been built for two years, but the competent departments have not sent vacationers, and the staff of the vacation sanatoriums only guard the houses and furniture every day. There are also cases where, due to improper institutional arrangements, there are too many administrative staff and too few medical staff, resulting in insufficient technical personnel when admission tasks arrive, which affects the development of medical work.
    The guiding principles and tasks of the sanatorium industry are also unclear. There is a lack of unified rules and regulations, and the indications are not strictly controlled. Especially in general cadre sanatoriums, there are too many patients with chronic diseases, some patients stay in the hospital for several years without being discharged, and some are hospitalized for a long time due to old age and frailty. If the state takes other measures to properly resettle them, the sanatoriums will be able to accommodate more people who need recuperation.
    Since the sanatoriums are under the leadership of a vertical system and there is a lack of a unified management organization locally, the political and ideological education and business leadership of the staff are not carried out in a timely manner, which leads to ideological confusion among some staff members, low work morale, and the relationship between staff and vacationers is therefore not harmonious enough, which affects the development of work.
    Based on the above situation, in order to reduce the waste in the sanatorium industry and give full play to the role of existing human and material resources, I suggest: (1) The Ministry of Health should formulate unified rules and regulations for the sanatorium industry to change the chaotic situation in the sanatoriums. (2) Under the leadership of the local party and government, a management committee should be established in the sanatorium area to implement regional unified leadership over the sanatoriums. Its tasks are: to directly lead the work that can be unified within the district, such as the management of the bathing beach, environmental sanitation, business learning and scientific research of staff, and political and ideological education of staff; to organize the sanatoriums to negotiate and solve the use of important equipment, physiotherapy equipment, auditoriums, and technical personnel; to supervise the rational use of beds in each hospital, urge the competent departments to regularly send patients or appropriately adjust the use of beds to avoid vacancy and waste, and supervise the capital construction and procurement of equipment in each sanatorium in the future.
    If these measures are implemented, I believe that we can make the best use of people's talents and materials, and the sanatoriums will be able to better serve the health of more people.

### 疗养院要有统一领导机构

　　疗养院要有统一领导机构
　　孙思哲
    青岛是我国的沿海城市，气候较好，风景宜人，一年四季都常有人到这里来休养，因此有些部门在这里建立了疗养院。现在，青岛市区海岸一带已经形成了一个疗养区。
    在疗养区内现有疗养院十二所，共有床位两千多张。几年来，大多数的疗养院都收容了一些病人，由于有良好的自然条件和一定的医疗设备，不少病人都摆脱了疾病的痛苦，恢复了健康，愉快地回到工作岗位。如青岛工人疗养院（结核病）治愈率达90％以上，每年平均有二百三十多人治愈出院工作。
    但是由于在疗养事业方面缺乏管理经验，缺乏统一领导，因而各疗养院之间忙闲不均，存在着使用率不高的现象。有的床位甚至长年空闲，造成很大的浪费。这种现象显然是不符合增产节约精神的。
    在十几个疗养院中除去三个疗养院（青岛工人、纺织、铁路）床位的使用率常年平均在85％以上以外，其他的疗养院只有夏、秋季使用率较高，冬、春二季的使用率非常低。特别是第二机械工业部工人疗养院和北京军区休假院，建成已经二年了，三百多个床位还没有正式收过休养员。在冬、春二季，整个疗养区平均空闲的床位约有九百多张，这些空闲床位如果能够利用起来，按每人疗养日期为三个月计算，每年可多收二千多个病人。这个潜力是很大的。
    各疗养院中除有一定数量床位外，器材和各种附属设备也几乎每院都有一套。全区共有X光机五架，有五所疗养院都有理疗部或理疗室，有六所疗养院有礼堂，至于一般的理疗器材，大多数的疗养院都有一点。但由于各疗养院都是垂直系统领导，互相之间没有联系，没有统一组织，所以在使用上不能互相配合，都是各自一套。如青岛疗养院的理疗部很大，病人不多，使用率不高；而铁路疗养院和全国总工会疗养院病人不少，但缺乏理疗设备，应该做的医疗都不能做。全国总工会疗养院和海军疗养院的院址同在一个地区，但各自都修建了一个大礼堂，路南一个、路北一个。如果能统一使用的话，两个疗养院有一个礼堂就足够了。
    因为疗养院不是统一领导，人力的浪费也很严重。有的疗养院除夏季外，秋、冬、春三季，部分工作人员无事可做。还有两个休养院，建成后两年来，主管部门没有送来休养人员，休养院的工作人员只是每天看管房屋和家具。也有的因为机构编制不当，行政管理人员太多，医务人员太少，在收容任务到来时，技术人员不足，影响医疗工作的开展。
    疗养事业的方针任务也是不明确的。缺乏统一的规章制度，对适应症掌握的不严，特别是在一般的干部疗养院中，久治不愈的病人太多，有的病人住上几年不能出院，也有的因为年老力衰，长期住院。如果国家采取其他办法妥善安置他们，疗养院就能收容更多的需要疗养的人员。
    各疗养院既是垂直系统领导，当地又缺少统一管理机构，对工作人员的政治思想教育和业务领导都做得很不及时，以致一些工作人员思想混乱，工作情绪不高，工作人员和休养人员之间的关系也因此不够融洽，影响工作的开展。
    根据以上情况，为了减少疗养事业中的浪费现象，充分发挥现有人力物力的作用，我建议：（一）卫生部对疗养事业作出统一的各种规章制度，以改变疗养院中的混乱现象。（二）在当地党政领导下，疗养区成立管理委员会，对各疗养院实行地区性的统一领导，它的任务是：把区内可以统一的工作直接领导起来，如海水浴场管理，环境卫生，工作人员的业务学习、科学研究以及对工作人员的政治思想教育；组织各院协商解决重要器材、理疗设备、大礼堂和技术人员的使用等问题；监督各院合理使用病床，督促各主管部门经常选送病人或适当调整使用病床，以避免空闲浪费，并监督今后各疗养院的基本建设和添购器材设备。
    实行了这些办法，我相信可以做到人尽其才，物尽其用，疗养院将能更好地为更多的人的健康服务。
