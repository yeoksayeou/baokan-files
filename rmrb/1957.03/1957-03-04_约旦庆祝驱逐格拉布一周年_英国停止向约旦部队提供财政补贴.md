    Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd, Amman Dispatch: Demonstrations were held in Amman, the capital of Jordan, and many other cities on March 1st to celebrate the first anniversary of Jordan's expulsion of Glubb, the former commander of the Arab Legion and a British citizen. Many students participated in the demonstrations.

    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 3rd: According to a report by the Middle East News Agency, the Jordanian government has been formally notified that Britain will no longer provide financial subsidies to the Jordanian armed forces starting from March 1st.
    According to official sources, the British government did not pay the subsidy payments for January and February of this year according to the original treaty. It has been announced that the Jordanian government will obtain financial assistance from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Syria, according to the agreements recently signed with these three countries.

    约旦庆祝驱逐格拉布一周年
    英国停止向约旦部队提供财政补贴
    新华社3日讯  安曼消息：约旦首都安曼和其他许多城市1日举行示威游行，庆祝约旦驱逐前阿拉伯军团司令、英国人格拉布的一周年。参加这次游行的有许多学生。
    格拉布曾经被称为“英国在中东的霸权的化身”。约旦国王侯赛因在去年3月1日下令解除了他的职务。侯赛因当时还解除了阿拉伯军团中一批重要英国军官的职务。
    新华社开罗3日电  据中东通讯社报道，约旦政府已经正式接到通知，从3月1日起英国不再对约旦武装部队提供财政补贴。
    据官方人士透露，英国政府没有按照原条约付出今年1月和2月的补贴款项。据宣布，约旦政府将根据最近同埃及、沙特阿拉伯和叙利亚签订的协定，从这三个国家取得财政援助。
