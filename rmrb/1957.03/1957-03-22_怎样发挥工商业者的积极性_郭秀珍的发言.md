How to Give Play to the Enthusiasm of Industrial and Commercial Businessmen
Guo Xiuzhen's Speech

　　I agree with and support the reports of the leaders; now I will talk about some experiences on how industrial and commercial businessmen can play an active role.

　　**In Work, Be Able to Contribute Strengths and Love Socialist Enterprises**

　　After the high tide of socialist transformation last year, most industrial and commercial businessmen in Shanghai were properly arranged in enterprises or specialized companies under the government's policy of assigning jobs according to talent and giving appropriate consideration. Under the leadership of public representatives, private personnel have been able to make certain achievements. Especially after the tight supply situation last year, we were able to use our many years of business experience and technical capabilities to actively find ways to save raw materials and solve supply problems from various aspects, or put forward practical and feasible methods for the leadership to refer to and adopt. For example, the electrical machinery industry is trying to use soft steel sheets instead of silicon steel sheets due to the lack of silicon steel sheets. After inspection by the Engineers Society, it is considered that there are no adverse phenomena. Under the current circumstances, it can be used to replace silicon steel sheets. The aluminum industry has also made preliminary achievements in experimenting with the use of old aluminum alloys to manufacture aluminum products. If it is found to be non-toxic after testing, aluminum ingots can be saved in the future. In terms of reforming product structure, the cotton spinning industry is changing to finer yarn counts to reduce cotton consumption. In terms of waste utilization, the paper industry is striving to use confidential documents of various government agencies and enterprises that have become ineffective as raw materials for papermaking, under the principle of ensuring that they are not leaked. The above situations all show that under the education of the Party, industrial and commercial businessmen have taken on the responsibilities of public officials and truly played the role of "wealth."

　　However, it is undeniable that some industrial and commercial businessmen have stagnated and are content with the status quo after their positions, salaries, and fixed interest rates have been determined. They are hesitant to embrace new things and unwilling to take the initiative. When using substitutes, trial-producing new products, or changing product structures, they are afraid that the experiment will fail, causing losses, and the responsibility is too great. In response to this ideological situation, objectively, the relevant management departments should establish necessary systems, clarify responsibilities, and provide rewards. After new products pass the test, in addition to giving the deserved rewards, if the output quality is affected due to not following the process or technical measures, the staff should be responsible. This can reduce the psychology of some industrial and commercial businessmen who are afraid of gain and loss and do not distinguish between responsibilities. But subjectively, this mentality of protecting oneself and seeking no fault just shows that we do not have deep feelings for socialist enterprises and do not love them enough. We also mistakenly regard the policy of assigning jobs according to talent and giving appropriate consideration as mainly giving consideration and secondarily using talent. We must cultivate deep feelings for socialist enterprises under the premise of patriotism, respond to the government's call for increasing production and practicing economy, and save raw materials under the premise of ensuring quality, and widely adopt those substitute raw materials and waste materials that are indeed usable, and unreservedly give play to our useful experience and technology. Being able to unite the solution of the enterprise's difficulties with one's own interests requires not only objective driving force, but more importantly, one's own subjective efforts. In order to lay a good foundation ideologically, the focus of our efforts should be on learning.

　　**In Learning, Be Able to Break and Establish; Do Not Block the Road to Self-Transformation**

　　Last year, the government held political schools to help industrial and commercial businessmen learn, laying the foundation for future theoretical learning. During the learning period, industrial and commercial businessmen were able to use criticism and self-criticism appropriately with an honest and progressive spirit. Some people said that although they have not undergone a complete transformation after learning, they have been refreshed. Some people, after learning, are not only actively responsible in their work and take the initiative to approach public employees, but also can use their own learning experience to untie the knots in other people's minds in the same industry, thereby also promoting other people's work. Therefore, it can be affirmed that learning is good for our work and transformation.

　　However, some industrial and commercial businessmen have a wait-and-see attitude towards learning, thinking that it is okay to learn or not to learn, and the fixed interest rate is still six years away, so it is okay to take a break in the middle. Some small business owners believe that they originally came from the working class, and now returning to the working class does not require learning. Others, although they participate in learning, regard the school as a sanatorium, using it to adjust their spirits. These kinds of views not only underestimate the importance of learning but also ignore the arduousness of transformation. We have lived in a capitalist society for decades, and the lifestyle and ideology of the bourgeoisie have taken root in us. If we do not break the old and establish the new, if we are still reluctant to part with the old ways of the bourgeoisie or simply deny its existence, then we are blocking the road to self-transformation. When the objective situation is developing rapidly, but one's own thinking still requires "steady progress," it will make our position unstable, our judgment of right and wrong unclear, our work improperly handled, and our progress in learning not fast enough. Only by negating capitalism and recognizing its two-sidedness can we demand learning and transformation as eagerly as a hungry person craves food, and only through learning can we explore the path of transformation.

　　**In Transformation, Be Able to Go Deep into the Lower Levels and Immerse Yourself in the Lives of the Laborers**

　　The transformation base for the vast majority of industrial and commercial businessmen is the enterprise, and the path of transformation is work practice. Some private personnel can be frank and honest with the public, and when studying key issues of the enterprise, they can "speak reasonably and persistently" about their own opinions, thus gaining the trust and help of the public, making achievements in their work, and shortening the distance with the workers. For example, the private factory director of the Jiuxin Enamel Factory has good technology and practical production experience, but no culture. The public helped him join the cultural study class run by the trade union and sent someone to assist him in recording his work. The private factory director was also able to concentrate on contributing his technology, improving the quality of export tea barrels, improving the reputation of domestic products, and winning the title and reward of advanced producer, changing the workers' views of him. The private sector also attended the factory's workers' congress, and he felt that he had duties and powers at work, and he was happy in his self-transformation. Therefore, the transformation we gain in work practice is solid and healthy, and the labor we engage in is glorious.

　　However, some industrial and commercial businessmen like to imprison themselves in the office, unwilling or afraid to go to the workshop or the grassroots, afraid of being rejected, afraid of losing face, and reducing their transformation base to the enterprise office. This kind of isolated transformation is divorced from reality, and it cannot stand the test of reality. As Committee Member Zhao Puchu quoted the Buddha, if a drop of water wants to never dry up, it can only be put into the sea. If the bourgeoisie wants to be transformed into self-reliant laborers, they must completely immerse themselves in the lives of the laborers. Going deep into the grassroots and personally dealing with the workers, in life, they are simple and unadorned; when analyzing problems, they are realistic and pragmatic; when personally solving problems with them, they will find that the potential of their wisdom is infinite. Only in such a realistic, vivid, and rich transformation environment can we overcome old habits and old ways of doing things, and be closely related to the workers, and gradually create good conditions for changing our class composition.

　　Fellow members: There are still some objective problems in the enthusiasm of industrial and commercial businessmen, which need the help and solution of relevant departments. However, as long as we can contribute our strengths and play the role of wealth in our work; be able to break and establish, and pursue truth in learning; and be able to go deep into the grassroots and approach the masses in transformation, we will not fail the expectations of the Party and the government, and we will be able to step firmly and steadily into the ranks of the working class. The most precious thing in the world is human labor and wisdom. If it is fully utilized and rationally used, it will always be a reliable guarantee for a happy life. (Attached picture)

### 怎样发挥工商业者的积极性　郭秀珍的发言

专栏：

　　怎样发挥工商业者的积极性
　　郭秀珍的发言
    我同意并拥护各位首长的报告；现在我就工商业者如何发挥积极作用谈些体会。
　　在工作中要能贡献所长热爱社会主义企业
    去年社会主义改造高潮后，上海工商业者在政府量才使用适当照顾的政策下，大部分都在企业或专业公司中获得了妥善的安排；在公方代表的领导下，私方人员都能作出一定的成绩，尤其在去年供应紧张后，能运用我们多年的业务经验、技术能力，积极设法从多方面来节约原料，解决供应问题，或者提出切实可行的办法，供领导上参考采用；例如电机业由于硅钢片缺乏，现在试用软钢片代替，并经过工程师学会检验，认为并无不良现象，在目前情况下，是可以用它来代替硅钢片的；铝器工业在试验用旧铝合金制造铝器方面，也获得初步成就，如经化验后无毒，今后铝锭即可节省不用；在改造产品结构方面，棉纺工业已在改细纱支，以减少用棉量；在废品利用方面，造纸工业在保证各机关企业已失时效的绝密文件不外泄的原则下，争取它作为造纸原料；以上情况，都说明工商业者在党的教育下，负起了公职人员的责任，真正发挥了“财富”作用。
    但是不可否认仍有部分工商业者，在定职、定薪、定息后，就停滞不前，安于现状；对新事物束手束脚，不肯主动；在采用代替品，试制新产品，改变产品结构时，怕试验不成，造成损失，责任太大。针对这种思想情况，在客观上，有关管理部门应该建立必要的制度，分清职责，给予奖励；在新产品试验合格后，除予以应得的奖励外，以后如因不按工艺过程或技术措施而影响产量质量时，应由工作人员负责；这样做可以减少部分工商业者患得患失、职责不分的心理；但是在主观上，这种明哲保身、但求无过的思想，正说明我们对社会主义企业的情感不深，热爱不够，对量才使用，适当照顾的政策，也错误地以照顾为主，使用为副；我们一定要在爱国主义的前提下，培养对社会主义企业的深厚情感，响应政府增产节约的号召，在保证质量的前提下，节约原材料，广泛采用那些确实可用的代用原料和废料，把我们有用的经验技术，无保留的发挥出来；能够把解决企业的困难同自己的利益一致起来，则不但要有客观的推动力，更主要的还要依靠自己主观的努力；为了在思想上打好基础，我们努力的重点就应该放在学习上。
　　在学习中要能有破有立不要堵塞自我改造的道路
    去年政府为了帮助工商业者进行学习，举办了政治学校，为今后的理论学习打下了基础；在学习期间，工商业者都能本着老老实实、要求进步的精神，适当地运用批评与自我批评；有的人说，学习后虽未脱胎换骨，却已面目一新；有的人在学习后，不但在自己工作上积极负责，主动靠拢公方职工，并且在同业中还能现身说法，用自己的学习心得，来解开别人思想上的疙瘩，因而也推动了别人的工作；因此可以肯定学习对我们的工作、改造都是有好处的。
    但有的工商业者，对学习抱着观望态度，认为学也好不学也好，定息尚有六年，不妨中途稍憩；有的小业主认为自己当初来自工人阶级，现在归向工人阶级是不需要学习的，也有人虽然参加了学习，却把学校作为休养所，借此调剂精神；这种种看法，不但低估了学习的重要，也忽视了改造的艰巨性；我们几十年来生活在资本主义社会中，资产阶级的生活习惯、思想意识都已在身上生了根；不破不立，如果对资产阶级的老一套，还是难舍难分或是根本否认它的存在，那就是自己搬石头堵塞自我改造的道路；当客观的形势在迅速发展，而自己的思想却还要求“稳步前进”时，就会使我们立场不稳，是非不明，工作中处理不当，学习中进步不快；只有在否定了资本主义，认清了两面性后，才能如饥如渴的要求学习，要求改造，也只有通过学习才能摸索出改造的途径。
　　在改造中要能深入下层投入劳动者生活中去
    绝大部分工商业者的改造基地是企业，改造途径是工作实践；有的私方人员能与公方开诚相见，在研究企业关键性问题时，对自己的意见能够做到“言之成理，持之有恒”，因而获得公方的信任与帮助，在工作中做出成绩，缩短了与职工间的距离；例如搪磁工业久新厂的私方厂长，技术好，有实际的生产经验，但是没有文化，公方就帮助他加入工会办的文化学习班，并派专人协助他搞工作记录；私方厂长也能专心的把技术贡献出来，改进出口茶桶的质量，提高了国产品的信誉，得了先进生产者的称号与奖励，改变了工人对他的看法，该厂开职工大会时，私方也列席参加，他觉得在工作中有职有权，在自我改造上心身愉快；所以我们在工作实践中获得的改造才是踏实的，健康的，所从事的劳动才是光荣的。
    可是有的工商业者却喜欢把自己软禁在办公室中，不愿或不敢下车间，下基层，怕碰钉子，怕失面子，把自己的改造基地缩小为企业的办公室，这样孤立的改造是脱离实际的，它经不起现实的考验；正如赵朴初委员引的佛说，一滴水如果要永远不干就只有放到大海里去；资产阶级要改造成为自食其力的劳动者，就必须把自己的心身完全投入劳动者的生活中去。深入基层，亲自与职工打交道，在生活中，他们是朴实无华的；在分析问题时，他们是实事求是的；当亲自同他们一起解决问题时，就会发觉他们智慧的潜力是无穷尽的；只有在这样现实、生动而丰富的改造环境中，我们才能克服旧习惯，旧作风，而与职工血肉相关，逐步的为自己改变阶级成分创造好条件。
    各位委员：工商业者目前在发挥积极性方面，尚存在着若干客观问题，需要有关部门予以帮助与解决；但是只要我们在工作中能够贡献所长，发挥财富作用；在学习中能够有破有立，追求真理；在改造中能够深入基层，接近群众；我们就不会辜负党与政府的期望，就能够坚定地踏实地一步一步走向工人阶级的队伍中去。世界上最可宝贵的是人类的劳动和智慧，如果得到充分发挥与合理运用，它就永远是幸福生活的可靠保证。（附图片）
