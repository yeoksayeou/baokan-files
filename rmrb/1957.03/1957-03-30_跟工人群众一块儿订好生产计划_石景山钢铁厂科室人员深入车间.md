　　Setting Production Plans Together with the Workers
　　Office Staff of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Go Deep into Workshops
    This newspaper reports: According to Beijing Daily, many office cadres of Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant went to the workshops to help workers make plans during the discussion of the national plan.
    The ash content of raw coal in the coal washing workshop this year has increased compared to last year, and the recovered clean coal has decreased. How can the recovery rate of clean coal be improved? Cadres from the accounting, supply, and technology departments went to the workshop with the workshop cadres to analyze the coal supply situation last year, find the changing pattern of raw coal quality, point out favorable factors, improve workers' confidence, and finally formulate a plan to save more than 44,000 tons of raw coal, which significantly reduced the cost of this workshop.
    Before mobilizing workers to discuss the plan, all departments formulated their work plans for this year through professional meetings. Many departments directly related to production have linked up with workshops in the process of helping workers to make plans, enriched the specific content of professional planning, and further created conditions for the increase production and conservation campaign. Last year, the factory once had difficulties in the supply of coal due to insufficient transportation capacity. Before the cadres of the production department went to the workshop this time, although they proposed to solve the problem of weak transportation capacity in the work plan, they lacked effective and specific measures. During the discussion of the plan in the transportation department, the workers proposed that if the arrangement of the material yard could be improved and the belt conveyor and bulldozer could be fully utilized, one bulldozer could replace the labor of twenty people, and the problem of insufficient transportation capacity could be solved.
    When many office staff went to the workshop to help workers discuss the plan, they obtained beneficial opinions from the workers to improve their work. The iron smelting department plans to increase the production of pig iron by more than 15,000 tons this year, and the workers are also very enthusiastic about increasing production, but they are worried about insufficient ore supply. At this time, the cadres of the supply department contacted the mine on the one hand to transport the ore that should be supplied in the second quarter of this year in advance; on the other hand, they organized the family members of employees to dig waste iron, and asked the city's smelting production cooperatives to process and wash iron slag to make up for the shortage of ore.
    At present, the work of discussing the plan in the workshop has largely ended. The office staff have begun to sort out and study the opinions and suggestions put forward by the workshop staff. Some of the problems that can be solved have been assigned to special personnel for research and solution.

### 跟工人群众一块儿订好生产计划　石景山钢铁厂科室人员深入车间

　　跟工人群众一块儿订好生产计划
　　石景山钢铁厂科室人员深入车间
    本报讯  据北京日报消息：北京石景山钢铁厂很多科室干部在这次讨论国家计划期间，下车间帮助工人订好计划。
    洗煤车间今年的原煤所含的灰石比去年增多，回收的净煤少了。怎样才能提高净煤回收率呢？会计科、供应科和技术科等科室的干部就下车间同车间干部一起，分析去年供煤情况，找到原煤质量的变化规律，指出有利因素，提高工人的信心，最后订出节约四万四千多吨原煤的计划，使这个车间成本显著降低。
    各科室在发动工人讨论计划以前，都通过专业会议，订出今年的工作规划。许多跟生产直接有关的科室，在帮助工人订计划的过程中，同车间挂上了钩，充实了专业规划的具体内容，为增产节约竞赛进一步创造了条件。去年厂里因为运输力量不足，煤的供应工作一度发生困难，生产科的干部这次下车间之前，虽然在工作规划中提出要解决运输力薄弱的问题，但是缺乏有效的具体措施。这次运输部讨论计划的时候，工人们提出，如果能改善料场的安排，充分利用皮带机和推土机，一架推土机就可以代替二十个人的劳动，运输力不足的问题就能够解决。
    许多科室人员下车间帮助工人讨论计划的时候，从工人那里得到改进工作的有益意见。炼铁部今年计划要增产一万五千多吨生铁，工人们的增产劲头也很大，只是耽心矿石供应不足。这时，供应科的干部就一方面跟矿山联系，把应该在今年第二季度供应的矿石提前运来；一方面又组织职工家属挖掘废铁，并且请本市熔炼生产合作社加工洗选铁渣，以弥补矿石的不足。
    目前，车间讨论计划的工作已经大体结束。科室人员开始整理和研究车间职工提出的意见和建议。有些能够解决的，已经指定专人研究解决。
