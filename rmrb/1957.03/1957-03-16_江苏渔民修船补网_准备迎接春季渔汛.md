    江苏渔民修船补网
    准备迎接春季渔汛
    新华社南京14日电  江苏渔民正在修船、补网，准备迎接春季渔汛。13日结束的省水产厅召开的各县、市、科（局）长会议确定：今年鱼业产量比去年增加6％到13％。总产量三十二万三千吨。争取达到三十五万吨。
    江苏省是我国有名的鱼产地之一，长江鲥鱼、松江鲈鱼、太湖银鱼都很名贵；黄花鱼占海洋鱼产的50％。
    江苏省91％以上的渔民已经参加了渔（农）业生产合作社。各地渔（农）业社最近都进行了整顿，制定了生产计划，还要在春汛生产中开展增产竞赛。
    发展群众性的淡水养殖事业，是江苏渔业增产的一个主要方面，重点县市有二十多个。全省今年已经放养和计划放养的水面有二百万亩，鱼种两亿五千万尾，养殖面积超过去年近30％。
