Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok: The 13th session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) opened in Bangkok on the 18th. This meeting will celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Commission's activities and discuss the situation and problems of industry, trade, and transportation in Asia, particularly concerning economic planning, minerals, electricity, and water resources.

　　The head of the Soviet delegation, P.A. Maletin, suggested at the opening of the meeting that an exchange of views should be held on the issue of the People's Republic of China's representation in the ECAFE. Representatives from India, Burma, Ceylon, Indonesia, and Afghanistan expressed their support, advocating that the People's Republic of China should immediately be given its rightful seat in the Commission.

　　However, the positions taken by the United States, the Philippines, South Korea, and some other countries hindered a positive resolution of this issue.

　　Representatives of these countries also violated existing rules of procedure by suggesting that the application of the Mongolian People's Republic to join the ECAFE should not be discussed. The Soviet Union, India, Burma, Indonesia, and other countries opposed this suggestion. The issue of discussing the Mongolian People's Republic's application was put to a vote and was rejected by a majority.

　　The meeting discussed the report submitted by the Commission's secretariat on the tenth anniversary of the Commission's activities.

　　Maletin said that the Commission had done a great deal of work during this period. The Commission discussed many major economic issues in Asian countries, with particular emphasis on the development of national industries, including the development of heavy industry.

　　The Soviet delegation believes that in order to develop the national economies of Asian and Far Eastern countries, to enable them to overcome the fatal consequences of colonialism, and to improve the material well-being of the people, it is necessary to expand the scope of the Commission's activities in international cooperation and make it an effective cooperation organization.

　　On the 21st, the meeting discussed the ECAFE secretariat's outline of the economic situation in the countries within the Commission's area of activity in 1956.

　　The head of the Soviet delegation, Maletin, pointed out in his speech that most countries in the ECAFE region have made significant achievements in developing their national economies over the past year. Countries in this region are now increasingly determined to eliminate restrictions that hinder the normal development of trade relations.

　　When talking about the issue of more developed countries providing economic assistance to less developed countries, Maletin said that the Soviet Union believes that such assistance can only be effective if it is based on the principle of equality, assisting less economically developed countries to develop internal resources and develop productive forces.

　　The Soviet representative emphasized that the Soviet Union is sincerely willing to assist Asian and Far Eastern countries in developing their economies and to provide them with practical assistance.

　　Representatives from Indonesia, the United States, Britain, France, Japan, Australia, the Netherlands, and other countries also spoke at the meeting.

　　苏印等国代表主张立即解决我国代表权问题
    据新华社讯　曼谷消息：联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会第十三次会议18日在曼谷开幕。这次会议将庆祝这个委员会进行活动的十周年，并且讨论亚洲的工业、贸易和运输方面的状况和问题，特别是关于经济计划、矿产、电力和水力资源等问题。
    苏联代表团团长普·阿·马列金在会议开幕时发言，他建议就中华人民共和国在亚洲及远东经济委员会里的代表权问题交换意见。印度、缅甸、锡兰、印度尼西亚和阿富汗这几国代表表示支持，主张立刻让中华人民共和国在这个委员会里得到它理所应得的席位。
    但是，美国、菲律宾、南朝鲜和其他一些国家所采取的立场妨碍了这个问题的积极解决。
    这些国家的代表还违反现有议事规程，建议不要讨论蒙古人民共和国要求参加亚洲及远东经济委员会的申请。苏联、印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和其他国家反对这个建议。讨论蒙古人民共和国的申请书的问题被提交表决，结果以多数票被否决。
    会议就这个委员会的秘书处提出的关于委员会进行活动十周年的报告进行了讨论。
    马列金说，在这段期间，委员会做了许多工作。委员会讨论了许多亚洲国家的重大的经济问题，其中特别重视发展民族工业的问题，包括发展重工业的问题。
    苏联代表团认为，为了发展亚洲及远东国家的民族经济，使它们克服殖民主义遗留下来的致命后果以及提高人民的物质福利，必须扩大这个委员会在国际合作方面的活动范围，使它变成有效的合作机构。
    21日，会议就这个委员会秘书处所提出的关于委员会活动所及地区各国在1956年的经济情况概述进行了讨论。
    苏联代表团团长马列金在发言时指出，亚洲及远东经济委员会活动所及地区内的大多数国家过去一年中在发展民族经济方面取得了显著的成就。这个地区的国家现在越来越坚决地要求消除妨碍贸易关系正常发展的限制。
    马列金在谈到比较发达的国家给予不大发达的国家以经济援助的问题的时候说，苏联认为，这种援助只有根据平等原则，协助经济不大发达的国家开发内部资源和发展生产力的情况下，才能有效。
    苏联代表着重指出，苏联真诚愿意协助亚洲及远东国家发展经济，并且给予它们实际的帮助。
    印度尼西亚、美国、英国、法国、日本、澳大利亚、荷兰等国代表也在会上发了言。
