Having attended the Supreme State Conference and listened to Chairman Mao's twelve-point instructions, I was sincerely inspired. After listening to Vice Premier Li's report on the draft of the Second Five-Year Plan, as well as Premier Zhou's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the Standing Committee, and after studying and discussing them, I felt very happy.

In Hubei, I am responsible for the work of the Research Institute of Culture and History. There are about 150 to 160 staff members there. Among them, seven are over 80 years old, and the majority are between 60 and 80. Very few are under 60. Some of these elderly people participated in the Wuchang Uprising of 1911, some were military, government, or judicial personnel, and some were intellectuals from the old society. Most of them have specialized skills. Except for those who are old and sick and cannot be active, the rest are engaged in learning, writing, poetry, calligraphy, and engraving, and each has achieved success. In the future, we should follow the instructions of "Let a hundred flowers bloom" and strive to show our talents even more. In terms of collective writing, after the great flood of 1954, Mr. Dong Biwu sent a letter from Beijing, asking us to follow the example of Hunan Province and compile historical data on natural disasters in Hubei Province, as a reference for the construction of various departments. After mobilizing the staff members and the counselors of the Counselor's Office to compile the book, it has been submitted for review and printing. Last year, following a telegram from the State Council, we were asked to compile local chronicles. Mr. Dong Biwu again instructed that the current compilation of local chronicles is to serve socialist construction and should start from the counties and cities, first compiling brief chronicles, and then compiling complete chronicles. The items in the brief chronicles should focus on the evolution of administrative divisions, natural conditions, economic conditions, the number of students, as well as local customs, and historical sites. The compiled books should be distributed to the construction, education, and civil affairs departments to meet urgent reference needs. The Hubei Provincial People's Committee has now appointed a person in charge to establish the Hubei Provincial Local Chronicle Compilation Committee, allocate personnel to conduct interviews, and designate personnel from the Research Institute of Culture and History and the Counselor's Office to be responsible for the compilation. When necessary, professors from universities and colleges and relevant people from society will be invited to assist. We have already started a pilot project in Xianning County. After gaining experience, we will promote it to other counties and cities, and it is estimated that it will take about three years to complete the compilation of brief chronicles for all counties and cities in the province. However, since this is a pioneering effort, it is expected that the interview and compilation procedures may not be perfect. If any of the committee members have participated in discussions on this task or have already taken on the work in various provinces and cities, they must have very good methods to learn from. I would like to request that the established rules and regulations be exchanged with each other and that we receive guidance on everything.

    高龄馆员积极修纂方志
    沈肇年介绍湖北文史馆的工作
    这次参加最高国务会议听了毛主席的十二点指示，我是衷心感奋，听了李副总理的第二个五年计划草案说明的报告，又听了本会主席周总理访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告，陈叔通副主席关于常务委员会的工作报告，经过学习讨论，感到十分愉快。
    我在湖北是担任文史馆工作的，那里面的馆员有一百五六十人，其中年在八十以上的有七人，在八十以内至六十的为最多，不满六十岁的是极少数。这些老人，有的是辛亥首义的，有的是军政司法人员，有的是旧知识分子，大多具有专长，除年老病多的不能有所活动外，其余的人，搞学习、搞著作、搞诗词、搞书画镌刻，都各有成就，今后当本着百花齐放的指示，益思有所表现。在集体写作方面，如1954年大水，董必武先生由京函告，要步湖南省的后尘，编辑湖北省的自然灾害历史资料，作为建设各部门的参考。经发动馆员和参事室的参事编辑成书，已送请审核付印。又上年奉国务院电示，修纂方志，复经董必武先生指示，以现在编纂方志，是为社会主义建设服务，应从各县市着手，先修简志，后修完全志。简志的项目应注重建置沿革、自然状况、经济情况、学生数量以及民情风俗、名胜古迹等等，编纂成书分发建设、教育、民政各部门以应参考急需。现已由湖北省人民委员会指定负责人成立湖北省方志纂修委员会调配人员担任采访，指定文史馆、参事室人员担任纂修，必要时并将聘请大专学校教授及社会有关人士相助为理。现已从咸宁一县开始试办，俟取得经验，再向其他各县市推进，预定约三年的时间将全省各县市简志编修完成。但事属创始，预定采访编纂各项手续容有未当，各位委员在各省市对于此项任务如曾经参加讨论或已担任工作，必有很好办法可资借鉴。兹特提请将既定规章互相交换，并指示一切。
