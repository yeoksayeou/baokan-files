The spring plowing season is approaching in most parts of the country. Topdressing fertilizer is needed for summer crops, and base fertilizer is needed for autumn crops. Many areas have done well because they paid attention to manure collection and fertilizer production early on, based on last year's experience. However, according to reports from various places, the amount of fertilizer prepared in some areas is far from the actual need, and in some areas, more than 50% of the fertilizer has not yet been secured. If we do not seize the opportunity to vigorously lead farmers in collecting and producing manure, we will not be able to meet the needs of summer and autumn crops, and it will affect the completion of this year's agricultural production increase tasks.

To carry out manure collection and fertilizer production, we must first eliminate the idea of simply relying on the state to allocate chemical fertilizers. This idea is quite common among cadres and farmers in some southern provinces. This greatly hinders the work of manure collection and fertilizer production. It should be explained to rural cadres and the masses of farmers that the state will allocate chemical fertilizers as much as possible to support agricultural production. However, due to the limited production of chemical fertilizers in our country at present, although the supply this year has increased compared to last year, the total amount is still not large; for some reason, the supply in the first half of the year is even less than in the first half of last year. Therefore, the main way to solve the fertilizer problem is still to increase the accumulation of natural fertilizers. This is also an important measure to reduce agricultural costs.

Some people say that after collectivization, the sources of fertilizer have been exhausted, and there is no fertilizer to collect. This is not in accordance with the facts. Qixin Agricultural Cooperative in Sanjia Township, Jianchang County, Liaoning Province, originally thought that the source of fertilizer was exhausted, but after discussion among the members, they found 19 kinds of fertilizer sources and collected 140,000 catties of fertilizer in just three days. Chengshan Agricultural Cooperative in Lushun excavated more than 10,000 piles of black soil from the roots of the mountains, which can be used as several thousand piles of manure. In many places in Gansu, there are still "no toilets for people and no pens for pigs," which results in the loss of many fertilizer sources. If this habit can be changed, a lot of fertilizer can be accumulated. Many green manures in the south do not grow well. If breeding work can be improved, fertilizer can also be accumulated. Other regions can also find ways to increase fertilizer accumulation in one way or another. The question is whether people can use their brains and actively find ways.

To increase fertilizer accumulation, it is necessary to comprehensively and practically mobilize the vast number of members of agricultural cooperatives to jointly study the source of fertilizer and formulate active and reliable plans. At the same time, the labor and tools required for fertilizer accumulation should be organized and allocated well. The four agricultural cooperatives in Guben Township, Hai'an County, Jiangsu Province, have achieved good results in fertilizer accumulation because they adopted this approach. All regions can do this.

Another important key to increasing fertilizer accumulation is to reasonably stipulate the labor remuneration for fertilizer accumulation and production and the purchase price of fertilizer. Last winter, the failure of some agricultural cooperatives to reasonably stipulate the labor remuneration for fertilizer accumulation and production and the low purchase price of fertilizer directly affected the development of fertilizer accumulation and production. This lesson is worth remembering. All regions must seek to roughly balance the labor remuneration for various fertilizer accumulation and production activities within the cooperative with the remuneration for other agricultural and sideline occupations. The purchase of fertilizers accumulated and produced by members themselves should also be priced according to quality. If the previous price is too low, it should be adjusted, and a portion of cash should be paid as much as possible when purchasing fertilizer. Only in this way can the enthusiasm of members in accumulating and producing fertilizer be encouraged.

In order to carry out manure collection and fertilizer production, the leading organs in various places should, in conjunction with other spring plowing preparations and the reform of the cultivation system, pay attention to strengthening the organization and ideological leadership of manure collection and fertilizer production. It is wrong for the leading organs in some places to think that manure collection and fertilizer production do not require leadership and that farmers will do it themselves. Therefore, they are only busy with other work and do not care about manure collection and fertilizer production. These comrades have forgotten that in order to increase the yield per unit area, more fertilizer must be applied; otherwise, there is no guarantee. Taking the conversion of single-cropping rice to double-cropping rice as an example, without sufficient fertilizer, even if it is converted to double-cropping, the yield will hardly be much higher than single-cropping.

When leading farmers in collecting and producing manure, the tendency to only seek quantity and not quality should be prevented. Some townships and cooperatives in Ningshuo and Gaolan counties in Gansu Province have already shown this tendency, and all regions should pay attention to it. It is obvious that even if a lot of fertilizer is accumulated, if the quality is very poor, it will not help the growth and yield increase of crops. In order to prevent this tendency, all regions should not only set quantitative targets in fertilizer accumulation and production, but also stipulate the quality requirements for fertilizer.

If attention is only paid to fertilizer accumulation and production, but not to fertilizer preservation and rational fertilization, the effectiveness of fertilizer cannot be fully exerted, which will cause waste. If human and animal manure are not stored properly, the nitrogen contained in them will turn into gas and will soon be lost. The *shuimaochi* [water-manure pond] in Shanxi Province, the practice of laying soil in human and animal manure in Hebei Province, and the *wawengshi maochi* [earthen jar-style manure pond] created by Zhang Benzi in Mengjin County, Henan Province, can all play a role in preserving fertilizer and can be considered for emulation. In terms of fertilization, methods such as changing broadcast application to band application can fully exert the fertilizer effect, and various regions can also refer to and adopt them.

Manure collection and fertilizer production are different from other work. Except for digging pond mud and cutting green manure, they cannot be completed by one or two "campaigns." Rather, they require day-by-day accumulation. In order to implement the principle of year-round manure accumulation, all regions must include manure accumulation in the entire agricultural production plan.

### 不能放松积肥

    不能放松积肥
    全国大部地区的春耕季节就要到了。夏熟作物需要施追肥，秋熟作物需要上底肥。许多地区因为有了去年的经验，及早注意了积肥造肥的工作，所以成绩较好。但是，根据各地报道，目前也有一些地区准备的肥料同实际需要量相差很远，有的地区甚至50％以上的肥料还没有着落。如果不抓紧时机大力领导农民积肥造肥，就会赶不上夏熟、秋熟作物的需要，就会影响今年农业增产任务的完成。
    要开展积肥造肥工作，必须首先扫除那种单纯依靠国家调拨化学肥料的想法。这种想法在南方一些省份的干部和农民中相当普遍地存在。这大大地障碍了积肥造肥的工作。应当向农村干部和农民群众说明，国家是要尽可能调拨化学肥料支援农业生产的。但是，由于我们国家目前化学肥料的生产并不多，所以今年供应量虽然比去年有所增加，总量却仍然不大；上半年的供应量因为某种原因，比去年上半年还要少。因此，解决肥料问题的主要出路，还是要靠增积自然肥料。这也是降低农业成本的一项重要措施。
    有人说，合作化以后，肥源挖尽了，没有什么肥料可积了。这是不合事实的。辽宁建昌县三家乡齐心农业社原来以为肥源挖尽了，但是经过社员群众讨论，就找出十九种肥源，在短短的三天内积了十四万斤肥料。旅顺城山农业社在山根挖掘出一万多堆黑土，能顶几千堆粪肥使用。甘肃有不少地方，至今还是“人无厕所猪无圈”，以致许多肥源散失。如果能够改变这种习惯，就可以增积很多肥料。南方不少绿肥成长得并不好，如能改善培育工作，也可以增积肥料。其他地区也都可以找到这样或那样的一些增积肥料的门路。问题是要看人们能不能开动脑筋，积极地想办法。
    要增积肥料，就要全面地切实地发动广大农业社的社员群众，共同研究肥料的来源，订出积极而可靠的计划。同时要把积肥所需要的劳力和工具组织好，分配好。江苏海安县古贲乡的四个农业社由于采取了这种作法，积肥的效果很好。各地都可以这样办。
    增积肥料的另一个重要关键，是要合理规定积肥造肥的劳动报酬和肥料的收购价格。去年冬季有些地区的农业社由于没有合理规定积肥造肥的劳动报酬，收购肥料的价格偏低，曾经直接影响了积肥造肥工作的开展。这个教训值得记取。各地必须将社内各种积肥造肥的劳动报酬和其它农副业劳动的报酬求得大体平衡。收购社员自积自造的肥料，也要按质论价。以前价格偏低的要调整，并且在收购肥料的时候，要尽可能支付一部分现金。只有这样，才能鼓励社员积肥造肥的积极性。
    为了开展积肥造肥工作，各地领导机关应当结合其他春耕准备工作及耕作制度的改革，注意加强对积肥造肥工作的组织和思想领导。有些地方的领导机关以为积肥造肥不用领导，农民自己会做，因而只是忙于其他工作，不管积肥造肥，这是不对的。这些同志忘记了，要使单位面积产量增加，就必须多施肥料，否则是没有保证的。以单季稻改双季稻为例，如果没有充足的肥料，尽管改成双季，产量也很难比单季提高多少。
    在领导农民积肥造肥的时候，应当防止只求数量不求质量的偏向。甘肃省宁朔、皋兰等县的一些乡、社已经发生了这种偏向，各地都应当注意。很明显，即使肥料积的很多，如果质量很坏，同样是无助于作物的成长和增产的。为了防止这种偏向，各地在积肥造肥中不仅应当订出数量指标，还要把对肥料的质量要求也规定下来。
    只注意了积肥造肥，而不注意保肥和合理施肥，就不能充分发挥肥料的效力，因而会造成浪费。人粪尿和畜粪尿如果贮存不好，其中所含的氮素就要变成气体，很快会失掉。山西省的水茅池，河北省在人畜粪尿中垫土，河南孟津县张本资创造的瓦瓮式茅池等，都能起到保肥作用，可以考虑仿行。施肥方面，把撒施改为条施等办法，能使肥效得到充分发挥，各地也可以参考采用。
    积肥造肥工作和其他工作不同，除了挖塘泥、割绿肥等以外，一般不是一次、两次的“突击”所能完成，而是要靠平常一点一滴地逐日积累。为了贯彻常年积肥的方针，各地必须把积肥工作列入整个农业生产计划中去。
