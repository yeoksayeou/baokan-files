Opinions on Education Work in Urban and Rural Primary and Secondary Schools
Speech by Wu Yan Yin

I am very satisfied with Vice Premier Li's explanation on some issues in the Second Five-Year Plan, except for some issues regarding primary and secondary education that still need to be studied and resolved. I also fully agree with the issues concerning primary and secondary education, such as the fact that primary and secondary school graduates cannot all be promoted to higher levels of education at present (in fact, this will be the case for a considerable period in the future), and that primary school buildings can be built by the community with public assistance or by the community with private assistance.

Vice Premier Li believes that certain aspects of our education system should be reconsidered based on various circumstances, and therefore raised six questions. Vice Premier Li's attitude is very humble, and all six questions are marked with question marks, without any decisions made. Now, I will address these six questions and share my personal opinions, which may not necessarily be correct:

1.  Should the school entry age be specified separately for rural and urban areas? I believe that the regulation of children's school entry age should: 1. Be aligned with the age when children leave kindergarten (although not every child attends kindergarten, many do, both in rural and urban areas). Currently, the age for leaving kindergarten is almost seven years old, and it cannot be delayed any further; 2. Facilitate graduation from university at a not-too-old age (although not every primary school graduate continues to higher education, some do) (entering primary school at seven years old leads to graduation at twenty-three or twenty-four), in order to avoid shortening the service period; 3. Be at the beginning stage of children's development of their desire for knowledge (including literacy), as both too early and too late are not suitable (because it is difficult to keep up too early, and it allows children to wander around the streets or villages idly and waste time, and they are also prone to bad habits); 4. Recognize that in many places (Northeast, Shanxi, Jiangnan...), rural primary schools are already enrolling children at seven years old, and there should be no regression. Therefore, I advocate that the primary school entry age should still be seven years old in principle, but in educationally backward areas, it can be flexibly adjusted to eight or nine years old, or even ten years old, regardless of whether they are in urban or rural areas. If it is rigidly stipulated that rural primary school children enter school at eight years old, it is not only theoretically untenable, but also not in line with reality. If it is said that stipulating that rural children enter school one year later will result in them being older at graduation and able to directly participate in agricultural production, that also does not seem to be a comprehensive view. Because rural children actually participate in rural labor while attending school, so one year earlier or later does not make a big difference, and it is not necessary to enter school one year later.

2.  How many years of compulsory education are appropriate for urban and rural areas, respectively? I believe that the duration of compulsory education can be longer in cities and shorter in rural areas. For example, if it is nine years in cities (primary and junior high school), it may be six years in rural areas; if it is raised to twelve years in cities, it can be raised to nine years in rural areas. However, in the primary school stage, it is best to have six years in both urban and rural areas as a principle. In educationally backward areas where six years cannot be achieved, the central government can grant special permission: those who have received four years of elementary primary education are considered to have received compulsory education. Four years of primary school education cannot be considered as the official duration of compulsory education. Because: 1. Chinese is difficult to learn. After four years of education, it is easy to abandon or completely discard the knowledge learned as soon as they leave school (becoming semi-literate or illiterate); 2. It is natural for farmers to demand that their children receive two more years of education, otherwise primary schools seem to have a dual-track system (one track for six years, which facilitates going to middle school; one track for four years, which does not facilitate going to middle school), and farmers will have opinions; 3. Currently, 40% of rural primary schools actually run six-year programs. If it is rigidly stipulated that cities have six years and villages have four years, requiring the already established six-year programs to revert to four-year programs is also not in line with reality. Of course, if they cannot receive six years of education, receiving four years is also good; if they cannot receive four years of education, attending children's literacy classes or private schools, or even learning while working, reading for a few months is also good. However, the former cannot be considered complete "national compulsory education," and the latter is more of a literacy campaign and cannot be considered "national compulsory education." As "primary school compulsory education" within "national compulsory education," there should only be one identical length of time, and there should not be two or more different lengths of time, in order to avoid multiple divergences.

3.  How can labor education and technical education be strengthened in primary and junior high schools? I believe that both junior high schools and primary schools should strengthen labor education in their regular education and teaching. However, in addition to setting up agricultural or industrial internship subjects in junior high schools and adding some basic agricultural knowledge to the science subjects in primary schools, and strengthening the teaching of the original "handicraft labor" subjects, primary schools can do without agricultural or industrial specialties. Because primary school children are young, have poor cultural foundations, and can learn old agricultural knowledge from their fathers and brothers at home. Due to the lack of a biology foundation, they cannot learn or learn well new agricultural knowledge even if they are taught. Furthermore, to strengthen labor education or technical education in primary and secondary schools, there must be funding to increase related equipment.

4.  Can high school graduates in rural areas who cannot go to higher education be given one or two years of agricultural technical education to engage in agricultural labor? I think this is of course possible and the best. If this can be done, then there is no need to advocate for adding agricultural specialties to senior primary schools. However, in fact, there are difficulties in education funding and teacher resources, so whether this can be done uniformly should be further studied.

5.  Can senior primary and junior high school graduates in cities who cannot go to higher education be given one or two years of technical education to participate in industrial production? I believe that, like the fourth question, if it can be implemented, that would be the best. However, what is the difference between giving this type of education to junior high school graduates and other technical schools that recruit junior high school graduates? And how to distinguish between them? It must also be studied.

6.  Can the establishment of primary and secondary schools be less concentrated in towns and cities and more dispersed in rural areas? I think this is of course very good. However, because of insufficient education funding, it is not easy to move existing middle schools from towns to rural areas, and it is not easy to add new ones in rural areas. Primary schools are originally dispersed in rural areas, but of course some places in rural areas still need to add primary schools to implement universal education. Adding primary schools also requires funding. Where does the funding come from? Community-run, cooperative-run, and children's literacy classes are only temporary measures of last resort and cannot continue forever.

In short, sources of funding for primary and secondary education must be developed, and the proportion should be gradually increased year by year. Otherwise, questions three, four, five, and six are likely to fall through, and questions one and two, which are based on the assumption of lack of money (to let children enter school later, to count four years of junior primary school as compulsory education, etc.), will not solve much of a problem.

Finally, I cannot completely agree with Vice Premier Li's statement that "the salaries of rural primary school teachers...should not differ too much from the income of farmers, and appropriate adjustments should be made." The current salaries of rural primary school teachers are not high, but they are much higher than the income of farmers. If they are to be adjusted downwards according to the income of farmers, that does not seem appropriate. Primary school teachers have relatively higher education and more complex labor; although farmers have less income, they do not have to buy food and fuel, and their lives are relatively simpler. How can they be compared and how can their incomes be made not to differ too much? Furthermore, if the salaries of rural primary school teachers are reduced, will the salaries of urban primary school teachers and teachers above the middle school level be reduced? If the former is reduced and the latter is not, and the treatment is different, how can people be convinced? Thirdly, most rural primary school teachers come from towns and cities. If salaries are reduced exclusively, who would be willing to go to the countryside? Fourthly, teachers' colleges are already unable to recruit students, and teachers' college graduates are also unwilling to work in rural areas. Who will do the educational work in the countryside in the future willingly? This issue is too important and I hope Vice Premier Li will consider it further.

Are my above personal opinions, which may not necessarily be correct, appropriate? I hope Vice Premier Li and all committee members and comrades will study and correct them.

　　对城乡中小学教育工作的意见
　　吴研因的发言
    李副总理关于第二个五年计划一些问题的说明，除了其中中、小学教育的一些问题本待研究解决之外，我表示十分满意。关于中、小学教育的一些问题，例如说中、小学毕业生目前无论如何不能全部逐级升学（其实不但目前，在将来的相当长时期里也是如此），小学校舍可采取自建公助或民办公助办法，我也完全同意。
    李副总理认为我国教育的某些制度，应当根据各种情况重新考虑，因而提出了六个问题。李副总理的态度是非常谦虚的，对这六个问题，都打了问号，没有作出决定。现在我针对这六个问题来谈谈我的不一定正确的个人意见：
    1、农村和城市中的入学年龄是否应当分别规定？我认为儿童入学年龄的规定，应该：一、和幼儿园幼儿出园时的年龄相衔接（幼儿虽然不个个进幼儿园，但进幼儿园的也不少，农村城市都有），现在幼儿园出园年龄是将及七足岁，不能再迟；二、便利于升学到大学毕业时（小学毕业虽然不个个升学，但升学到大学毕业的也有一部分）年龄不太大（七足岁入小学要二十三—二十四才毕业），以免服务时期减短；三、在儿童求知欲（包括识字读书）正发展的开始阶段，太早太迟都不相宜（因为太早跟不上，太迟要让儿童在街头或村庄闲逛，虚掷光阴也容易沾染不良习惯）；四、要看到有许多地方（东北、山西、江南……）的农村小学已是招收七足岁儿童了，不能倒退。因此，我主张：小学入学年龄仍以七足岁为原则，但教育落后地区，得变通到八足岁或九足岁甚至十足岁入学，不论城市农村都是如此。如果硬性规定农村小学儿童八足岁入学，不但理论上说不过去，也是不切合实际的。如果说规定农村儿童晚一年入学，毕业时年龄大些，可以直接参加农业生产，那也似乎不是全面的看法。因为农村儿童，实际上是一面上学，一面参加农村劳动的，早一年，晚一年，关系不大，不必定要晚一年入学。
    2、国民义务教育城乡各以多少年为合适？我认为义务教育年限，城市可以长些，农村可以短些，例如城市如果九年（小学、初中），农村不妨六年；城市如果提高到十二年时，农村可提高到九年。但是在小学阶段，不论城乡最好都以六年为原则。教育落后地区不能达到六年的，可由中央特许：对受过四年制初级小学教育的，以已受过国民义务教育论。四年小学教育，不能作正式的义务教育年限。因为：一、汉文难学，受了四年教育，一出校门就容易前功半弃或尽弃（变成半文盲或文盲）；二、农民要求能给他们的子女多受两年教育是很自然的，否则小学也似乎双轨制（一轨六年，便于升中学；一轨四年，不便升中学），农民会有意见；三、现在的农村小学，实际上办六年制的已占40％了，如果硬性规定城市六年，乡村四年，要使已办的六年制退到四年制，也是不切合实际的。当然，如果受不到六年教育，受四年也好；如果受不到四年教育，进儿童识字班或者私塾甚至牛角挂书，读几个月也好。但是前者不能算完全的“国民义务教育”，后者更是扫盲性质，决不能以“国民义务教育”论。作为“国民义务教育”的“小学义务教育”，应该只有相同的一个年限，不要有不同的两个以上年限，以免多所纷歧。
    3、现在的小学和初中如何加强劳动教育和技术教育？我认为初中和小学都应当在平时的教育和教学中加强劳动教育。但技术教育除了在初中设农业或工业实习科、小学自然科中增加一些农业基本知识并就原设的“手工劳动”科加强教学以外，小学可不设农业或工业专科。因为小学儿童年龄小，文化基础差，对旧的农业知识可以在家中从父兄们学习到，新的农业知识由于没有生物学为基础，要学习也学习不了、学习不好。又要在中小学加强劳动教育或技术教育，也必须有经费以便增加有关设备才好。
    4、农村不能升学的高小毕业生是否可以给予一两年农业技术教育，以便从事农业劳动？我认为这当然可以而且是最好的。如果能这样办，那末小学高级就不必再主张增设农业专科了。不过事实上，教育经费有困难，师资也有问题，能否一律这样做，应当再加研究。
    5、城市不能升学的高小和初中毕业生是否可以给予一、两年技术教育，以便参加工业生产？我认为这和第四个问题一样，如果能实施的话，那最好。但是给予初中毕业生以这类教育，和招收初中毕业生的其他技术学校何有区别？并如何区别？也一定要研究。
    6、中小学的设置，是否可以少集中在城镇，多分散在农村？我认为这当然很好。不过因为教育经费不足，已设的中学不容易从城镇移往农村，未设的也不容易在农村添设。小学本来是分散在农村的，当然农村有些地方还需要添办小学以实行普及教育。要添办小学，也需要经费，来源在何处呢？民办、社办、儿童识字班，都只是目前不得已的临时措施，不能永远这样下去。
    总而言之，中小教育经费必须开辟来源，逐年逐步增加比重。否则三、四、五、六四个问题容易落空，一、二两个作没钱的打算（要让儿童晚些入学，要初小四年毕业就算已受过义务教育等）的问题，也解决不了多大的问题。
    最后，我对李副总理“农村小学教员，……他们的工资不应同农民的收入相差太多，应当进行适当的调整”的说法，不能完全同意。现在的农村小学教师工资是不高的，但比农民的收入却相差得很多，如果要照农民的收入向下调整，那似乎是不恰当的。小学教师文化比较高，劳动比较复杂；农民的收入虽然少，他们不必买进食粮和燃料，生活也比较简单些。彼此之间如何能比，如何能使他们的收入不相差太多呢？再则农村小学教师要减低工资，城镇小学教师和中学以上教师的工资减不减？如果这要减，那不减，待遇各别，如何令人心服？三则农村小学教师大半是从城镇去的，如果独减工资，谁肯下乡呢？四则师范学校本招不到学生，师范毕业生也本不愿往农村工作，将来的农村的教育工作又叫谁心服情愿地去做呢？这个问题关系太大了，希望李副总理再加考虑。
    我的上述不一定正确的个人意见，是否有当？希望李副总理和各位委员、各位同志研究、指正。
