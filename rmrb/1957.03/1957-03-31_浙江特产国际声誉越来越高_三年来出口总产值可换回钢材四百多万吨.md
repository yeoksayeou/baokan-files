Zhejiang's Special Products Gain Increasing International Reputation
　　Export Value in Three Years Could be Exchanged for Over Four Million Tons of Steel

　　(Our Dispatch) Silk, tiles, golden thread straw hats, silk umbrellas, fish meal, Shaoxing wine, Jinhua ham, and braised bamboo shoots, among more than twenty industrial and handicraft products from Zhejiang Province, have earned a high reputation in the international market. Over the past three years, the total output value of these export products could be exchanged for 4,720,000 tons of steel.

　　Zhejiang's export products have always been known for their diverse styles and excellent quality. For example, Zhejiang silk, which has always been highly regarded, is now exported to more than fifty countries. Among them, rayon brocade, cooked figured brocade, and "210" spun silk fabrics all meet international standards. The quality of rayon brocade has surpassed that of Japanese products, which are the most developed in silk production in the world. Last year, Zhejiang also trial-produced 129 new products for export plans. This year, foreign orders have increased significantly, with brocade alone increasing by 50% compared to last year. Zhejiang tea, which sells well in the world's six continents, has a history of 300 years. Both gunpowder tea and pearl tea surpass all other countries in the world in terms of aroma, taste, and color. The suede leather manufactured by the Zhejiang Nanxun Detai Shun Tannery is soft, strong, and brightly colored, comparable to the suede leather of the United Kingdom and the United States. Other industrial products such as Shaoxing wine, Jinhua ham, Shaoxing fermented bean curd, and Ningbo braised bamboo shoots are world-renowned. For example, the "Gold Medal" Shan Nian wine produced by Shaoxing Shen Yonghe and Mo Ji Wineries, and the braised bamboo shoots produced by Ningbo Rusheng Cannery have won honorary certificates and medals at international exhibitions.

　　In order to expand export products, the broad masses of workers in Zhejiang have actively improved product quality, greatly increasing the country's foreign exchange income. According to statistics, the export of silk fabrics after liberation can be exchanged for the complete equipment of forty-five 25,000-kilowatt power plants.

　　浙江特产国际声誉越来越高
　　三年来出口总产值可换回钢材四百多万吨
    本报讯  浙江省生产的丝绸、磁砖、金丝草帽、绸伞、鱼粉、绍兴酒、金华火腿、油焖笋等二十多种工业和手工业产品，在国际市场上博得很高的声誉。三年来，这些出口产品的总产值可换回钢材四百七十二万吨。
    浙江外销产品一向以花式多样，品质优良著称。如历来负有盛名的浙江丝绸，现在已外销到五十多个国家，其中人丝织锦缎、熟货提花织锦缎、“二一零”绢丝三种织物都达到国际标准，人丝织锦缎的质量已经超过世界上丝绸生产最发达的日本产品。去年浙江又试制了一百二十九种新产品列入出国计划，今年国外订货大大增加，单织锦缎一项就比去年增加了50％。畅销世界六大洲的浙江茶叶，已有三百年的历史，眉茶和珠茶不论香、味、色都超过世界各国。浙江南浔德泰顺制革厂制造的绒面革，皮身柔软、坚固，色泽鲜艳，可以和英美国家的绒面革媲美。其他如绍兴酒、金华火腿、绍兴腐乳和宁波油焖笋等工业产品都举世闻名，如绍兴沈永和和墨记酒坊出产的“金牌”善酿酒、宁波如生罐头厂出产的油焖笋曾先后在国际性展览会上获得了荣誉奖状和奖章。
    浙江广大职工为了扩大出口产品，积极提高了产品质量，大大地增加了国家的外汇收入。据统计，解放后出口绸缎可换回四十五个二万五千瓩发电厂的全部设备。
