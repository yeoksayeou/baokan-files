Regarding Shanghai's Intellectual Work
Liu Shuzhou's Speech

Shanghai is a city with a relatively high concentration of intellectuals. According to our rough survey, there are approximately 400,000 intellectuals with at least a secondary education, including over 11,000 senior intellectuals. In recent years, like intellectuals across the country, they have played an undeniable positive role in political, economic, and cultural work. Shanghai's intellectual work is based on the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC)'s policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals, and follows the instruction of Comrade Zhou Enlai at the CPC Central Committee's meeting on intellectual issues: "To mobilize and utilize the existing intellectual forces to the fullest extent, continuously raise their political consciousness, cultivate new forces on a large scale to expand their ranks, and improve their professional skills as quickly as possible to meet the country's ever-growing need for intellectuals." After the CPC Central Committee's meeting on intellectual issues, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee drafted a two-year outline for intellectual work to promote the strengthening of leadership over this work by organizations at all levels. I will now report on several major situations and issues of concern to everyone in Shanghai's intellectual work over the past year—mainly focusing on senior intellectuals—and request criticism and guidance.

First, regarding the improvement of working conditions for intellectuals:

The issue of assistants, which senior intellectuals urgently demanded, has been initially resolved. According to statistics from seven units, including the Shanghai Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fudan University, Jiaotong University, and East China Normal University, 470 additional assistants and support personnel have been added (factories and enterprises have also added some). The majority of senior intellectuals have been guaranteed five-sixths of their work time, and efforts are being made to reduce the burden on those with excessive after-hours commitments. There has been a significant increase in books and materials last year, and the funding for public libraries has more than doubled, with preliminary improvements made to the supply methods for books and materials. Last year, due to the overly rough integration of industries after public-private partnerships, the collaborative relationships for the repair and manufacturing of scientific instruments and equipment were disrupted for a time. Now, these relationships have gradually been restored, and some have been improved and expanded to a certain extent based on needs. The Municipal People's Committee recently decided to establish an organization to resolve coordination issues related to scientific research work. Regarding improvements in living conditions, the main focus has been on a comprehensive adjustment of wages and a gradual improvement in housing conditions. According to the wage adjustments of 10,979 faculty and staff in 18 higher education institutions, the average total wage increased by 16.34%, with an average increase of 20.84% for teaching staff. There were also significant improvements in housing conditions last year, with adjustments made for most faculty and staff in Shanghai's universities whose residences were too far from the campus or whose living conditions were poor. The Municipal People's Committee also specifically allocated 350 better residences for senior intellectuals. Although this work is still far from sufficient and has brought about some new opinions, the working and living conditions of most intellectuals have improved somewhat, and it has taken a step further in consolidating their professional thinking.

However, along with these improvements, some new shortcomings emerged last year. For example, some of the young assistants assigned still did not match their training with their work or substituted quantity for quality. There were also instances of confusion in the selection, organization, and use of books and materials, with some units blindly purchasing books in a rush to spend money, and some units purchasing too much experimental equipment or leaving it unused. The idea of running science and schools thriftily was somewhat weak, and the idea of emphasizing research over teaching and emphasizing profession over politics once rose. Some young intellectuals even put forward the so-called "expert first, red later" and "great scientist, insignificant philosopher" arguments. Other issues, such as comparing salaries, comparing status, and unwillingness to work in remote areas, were also occasionally heard. However, these shortcomings can be gradually resolved as long as we strengthen political and ideological leadership and pay attention to creating conditions for improving work.

Second, in implementing the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," ideological debates in Shanghai's newspapers and magazines have become more active in the past year than in the past.

As far as I know, debates on the antagonistic and non-antagonistic nature of current class contradictions, on the one-sided and comprehensive issues in short essays, on the issues of comrades and friends, class and personal feelings, on the "eat what is available" versus "have what you want" debate in market supply, and on the reorganization and creative paths of film and opera have all widely touched on various aspects of life and the scope of ideological and theoretical principles, giving people many beneficial insights. Teaching and scientific research in schools have been strengthened, new scientific research institutions and scientific research papers are constantly increasing, new academic journals are constantly emerging, and a spirit of debate has begun to emerge in academic discussions and academic reports. The creation of film scripts has exceeded previous records, and the newly reorganized and restored traditional arts have become even more abundant. These are all major achievements of the Party's correct cultural and academic policy and are the positive manifestations of Shanghai's intellectuals' enthusiastic support of the Party's call.

However, in the practice of "blooming" and "contending," there are still many problems. I believe that the current problem is that our ideological mobilization work is not yet sufficient, our understanding of how to handle contradictions among the people is not thorough, our ability to distinguish right from wrong is not strong, and the ranks of debaters have not yet been cultivated. In particular, people are still very unaccustomed to the atmosphere of being brave in criticism and brave in accepting counter-criticism. Therefore, some still have concerns and take a wait-and-see attitude, while others speak stiffly and are not persuasive. These are problems that need to be gradually resolved in future practice.

Third, the relationship between Party and non-Party intellectuals.

I believe that this relationship is basically good. As I said above, there are approximately 400,000 intellectuals in Shanghai, playing a significant role in various positions. Among them, 80 to 90 percent are not yet members of the Communist Party today. Their contribution to the socialist cause proves that their relationship with the Party is not bad. Taking intellectuals in government organs as an example, non-Party intellectuals account for more than 41.1% of the 790 Shanghai Municipal People's Representatives, more than the number of Party members. The average number of intellectuals in the 18 district people's representatives also reached 31%. Non-Party intellectuals also account for 45% to 32% of the members of the Municipal People's Committee, and non-Party intellectuals account for more than 20% of the heads of various departments of the municipal government. As for organizations at all levels of the CPPCC, the proportion of non-Party intellectuals from all walks of life is even greater. Most of them are able to perform their duties in these leading positions in state affairs. In addition, there are local organizations of various friendly parties in Shanghai that share the same goals as us. They have a total of more than 11,000 members, more than 70% of whom are representatives of middle and upper-class intellectuals. Through them, we are greatly helped to carry out the work of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals more widely. This broad relationship of unity and cooperation is an important guarantee for the continuous victory of our current socialist transformation and socialist construction. It is an important symbol of the further development and consolidation of the united front. However, there are problems between the Party and non-Party intellectuals. My superficial understanding has these points:

1.  Differences in worldview, outlook on life, and ideological style arising from different social origins and life experiences. Some of these can be resolved, while others are temporarily difficult to resolve. But regardless of whether they can be resolved, as long as the political goals are the same, it still cannot hinder the relationship of unity and cooperation. In order to further strengthen this relationship, we must rely on frequent and well-intentioned criticism and self-criticism to gradually move forward. Any approach that is eager for quick success is not feasible. In this regard, our Shanghai Communist Party comrades often do not do well enough.

2.  Some Communist Party members still have residual sectarian sentiments, and therefore do not respect or help non-Party people enough. This thinking is sometimes manifested in rude and stiff attitudes, and sometimes in "respectful but distant" and "peaceful coexistence." Non-Party people reflect that Party members treat non-Party people with "too much politeness" and "not enough help." This is indeed an important obstacle to the current united front work. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued many instructions to urge the whole party to correct it. The Shanghai Party organization has also conducted many inspections and educations inside and outside the party. At present, the relationship between the party and non-party has improved a lot. We also hope that non-party comrades will help us to continue to improve our shortcomings, and encourage each other to improve together and establish a closer relationship of mutual trust and mutual assistance.

3.  There are also very few people whose ideological conditions are far from social reality, and therefore there must be a certain distance from the Party. For example, some people in Shanghai listed some shortcomings in industrial construction and resolutely said that our industrial construction in recent years is the same as Zhang Zhidong's factory, and it seems that it is destined to fail completely. He cannot even distinguish that the era of Zhang Zhidong is different from the era of the People's China. For example, some people say that the conclusion of the education business in these years is three words: biased, bad, and chaotic. Therefore, it is further proposed that the party cannot lead the school and the "professors should govern the school." I personally think that these opinions are good for us to criticize, but his fundamental point of view is problematic. To solve these political understanding problems, it seems that we still have to do long-term and arduous persuasive education work to be effective.

In short, I think the issue of unity is also a unity of opposites. From the dialectical law of contradiction, there is no unity without disunity. Chairman Mao taught us that "starting from the desire for unity, through criticism and struggle, to achieve new unity on a new basis," this is the only principle for us to further strengthen the relationship between the party and non-party and the direction of our common struggle.

Fourth, on the issue of mobilizing the strength of social intellectuals.

According to a survey in the spring of last year, there were more than 24,400 various intellectuals in Shanghai who were equivalent to or above the high school level. In the past year, nearly 6,000 people have been introduced to employment by local labor departments and united front departments, and 1,579 people have been assigned jobs through the unified national recruitment. In addition, a considerable number of social youth intellectuals have also been absorbed into the large number of students enrolled in various universities and technical schools last year. Therefore, judging from the overall situation, the phenomenon of unemployment of intellectuals has been greatly reduced. The achievements of intellectual employment work in the past year are remarkable, but there are still many problems to be completely solved:

First of all, some of the intellectuals who are currently unemployed are old and weak or have no specific expertise, and it is still difficult to achieve full employment.

Secondly, the ideological problems of the individuals have not been resolved, and the requirements for employment conditions are too high, which is not easy to arrange for a while. For example, among the 6,033 applicants in this unified recruitment, only 834 people were willing to obey the assignment, which is less than 14% of the number of applicants. Therefore, more ideological education work needs to be done for these people.

Thirdly, it is also necessary to slow down the steps of employment work temporarily due to the current streamlining of institutions and the reduction of employment opportunities.

At present, we plan to individually select some people with real talent and considerable ability from the combination of adjusting institutions and rationally using talents. At the same time, we will strengthen the education of unemployed intellectuals and open up employment channels in many ways so that whenever there is an opportunity, it will not cause difficulties in the allocation of work due to personal desires. At the same time, we must also encourage those who are old and weak to do some personal minor labor, contribute their strength in a realistic manner, and feel at ease with the support of their children. The government has provided life relief to people with very difficult lives, and this work must be strengthened in the future. The phenomenon of temporarily burying talents is bound to be inevitable at present, but we believe it can be gradually resolved.

Fifth, I would like to talk about the anti-reactionary work among intellectuals that everyone is concerned about.

Shanghai's anti-reactionary struggle, like other parts of the country, started with the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. At the beginning of the movement, it generally started with drawing a clear line of demarcation between the enemy and ourselves, which improved the political consciousness of most people. However, the ideological struggle was relatively sharp, and the area that received ideological criticism was also relatively wide, which caused a greater shock among the intellectuals in Shanghai. Not long after the movement, when it turned to political struggle, we strictly controlled the boundaries of the political struggle in a timely manner according to the clear instructions of the Party Central Committee. The progress of the movement was basically healthy, and the distinction between the enemy and ourselves was finally completely clear. Taking the anti-reactionary movement of the first batch of senior intellectuals in Shanghai as an example, about 9% of the people received ideological criticism, of which 6% underwent political review due to mass accusations of various political and historical issues of varying degrees. However, most of them were not treated as counter-revolutionaries after it was found that there were no facts of counter-revolutionary crimes or that the crimes were minor. In the end, only less than seven thousandths of the people were punished by law for serious crimes and conclusive evidence. As for the anti-reactionary struggle in the second phase and later, since most people have clearly distinguished the enemy from ourselves, and have experience in grasping policies, the counter-revolutionaries have been isolated in the masses and even surrendered themselves, so the fluctuations in the struggle are very small. This is the basic situation of the anti-reactionary struggle. Here we should point out that some of those who were subjected to political struggle in the first phase of the anti-reactionary movement did not need to be subjected to political struggle or the struggle was excessive. For these people, explanations and apologies have been made separately afterwards, and some have even publicly reviewed the shortcomings in the movement to educate the masses and cadres, and most of the gaps have been eliminated. Facts have proved that after the anti-reactionary movement, the overall situation among intellectuals is: political and work enthusiasm has been improved, criticism and self-criticism has been carried out, the atmosphere of academic debate has been strengthened, and many people have actively and conscientiously formulated their own plans to advance to science. However, there are still very few people who are still dissatisfied after many apologies. I think that in the future work, we will continue to use the facts of unity and mutual trust to gradually improve this relationship, which is entirely possible.

Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, and with the love and help of comrades from various friendly parties, as a Communist Party member working in Shanghai, for our common socialist cause, I am willing to be with the Party members in Shanghai, work hard to overcome some sectarianism, subjectivism, and bureaucratic style of thinking in my work, and better unite and cooperate with comrades outside the party to fight together.

　　关于上海市的知识分子工作
　　刘述周的发言
    上海是一个知识分子相当集中的城市。据我们粗略调查，中学程度以上的知识分子约有四十余万人，其中高级知识分子一万一千余人。几年来，他们和全国知识分子一样，在政治、经济、文化工作上，都发挥了无可争辩的积极力量。上海市的知识分子工作，是根据中共中央团结、教育、改造知识分子的政策，并遵照周恩来同志在中共中央召开的知识分子问题的会议上所提出的“最充分地动员和发挥现有的知识分子的力量，不断地提高他们的政治觉悟，大规模地培养新生力量来扩大他们的队伍，并且尽可能迅速地提高他们的业务水平，以适应国家对于知识分子的不断增长的需要”这一指示来进行的。中共中央知识分子问题会议后，上海市委拟订了两年知识分子工作纲要，推动各级组织加强对这项工作的领导。兹仅就个人所见的上海市一年以来知识分子工作——主要是高级知识分子工作中，大家所关心的几个主要情况和问题，作如下的汇报，请求批评和指教。
　　第一，关于改善知识分子工作条件方面。
    高级知识分子所迫切要求的助手问题，已经初步解决。根据中国科学院上海办事处、复旦、交大、华东师大等七个单位的统计，就增加了助手和辅助人员四百七十人（工厂、企业也增加了一部分）。大多数高级知识分子六分之五的业务时间，已经有了保证，少数业余时间负担过重的，也正在尽力设法减轻。图书资料在去年有了较多的增加，各公共图书馆经费也增加了一倍以上，图书资料供应办法也有了初步改进。去年由于公私合营，行业归口过于粗糙，曾经一度打乱了科学仪器研究器材的修理制造的协作关系，现在也已经逐渐恢复，有的根据需要还有了一定程度的改进和扩大；市人民委员会最近已决定设立一个机构，来解决有关科学研究工作的协调问题。至于在生活改善方面，主要是全面调整了工资和逐步改善了居住条件。根据十八所高等学校一万零九百七十九个教职人员工资调整的结果，平均工资总额增加为16.34％，其中教学人员平均增加20.84％。居住条件方面，去年也有了较大的改善，上海各个高等学校教职人员住所离校过远或居住条件过差的，大都已作了调整。市人民委员会还专门调拨了三百五十户较好的住宅供给了高级知识分子。尽管这些工作做得还很不够，而且还带来了某些新的意见，但是多数知识分子的工作条件和生活条件是改善一些了，对巩固他们的专业思想也跨进一步了。
    然而随着这些工作的改善，去年也出现了一些新的缺点，如调配的青年助手中还有一部分学用不一致或以量代质的情况。图书资料的选购、整理和使用上也还有混乱现象，有些单位为了突击花钱盲目抢购图书，某些单位的实验器械也有添购太多或搁置不用的情况。勤俭办科学、勤俭办学校的思想较为淡薄；重研究轻教学、重专业轻政治的思想，曾经一度上升，有些青年知识分子曾提过所谓“先专家，后红色”，“伟大的科学家，渺小的哲学家”的论调。其他如比待遇，比地位，以及不愿到边远地区工作等等，亦时有所闻。但是这些缺点，只要切实加强政治思想领导，注意创造改进工作的条件，问题是可以得到逐步解决的。
　　第二，在贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针方面，过去一年来上海报章杂志上的思想论争较过去活跃起来了。
    据我所知，如对当前阶级矛盾的对抗性和非对抗性的论争，对小品文中片面和全面问题的论争，对同志和朋友、阶级和个人感情问题的论争，对市场供应中“有啥吃啥”和“要啥有啥”的论争，对电影戏曲的整理和创作途径的论争等等，都广泛的接触到生活的各个方面和思想理论原则的范畴，给人们不少有益的启示。学校教学工作和科学研究工作都加强了，新的科学研究机关和科学研究论文不断增加，新的学术刊物不断涌现，学术讨论和学术报告中开始有了辩论的风气。电影剧本创作超过以往的纪录，新整理和恢复的传统曲艺更形丰盛。这些都是党的正确的文化、学术方针的重大成就，是上海知识分子热忱拥护党的号召的积极表现。
    但在“齐放”和“争鸣”的实践中，问题还是很多的，我认为目前的问题是我们的思想发动工作还做得很不够，对如何处理人民内部矛盾问题的理解不透，明辨是非的能力不强，论战的队伍还没有培养起来，特别是人们对勇于批评和勇于接受反批评的风气还很不习惯。因此，有的还心存顾虑，抱观望态度，有的则出言生硬，说服力不强，这是有待于今后实践中逐渐解决的问题。
　　第三，党与非党知识分子的关系问题。
    我认为这种关系基本上是良好的。我上面说过，上海大约有四十多万知识分子，在各个岗位上起着重大的作用，这中间百分之八、九十今天还不是共产党员，他们对社会主义事业的贡献证明了他们和党的关系不是不好的。拿政权机关中的知识分子来说，上海市人民代表七百九十名中非党知识分子占总数的41.1％以上，比党员人数还多。十八个区人民代表中知识分子平均也达到31％。市区人民委员会的委员中，非党知识分子也占总数45％到32％不等，市级政府各部门负责人中，非党知识分子占20％以上。至于各级政协组织，各阶层非党知识分子占的比数更大得多了。他们在这些国家事务的领导岗位上大多数是能够守职尽责的。此外，在上海还有和我们同一个目标的各个友党的地方组织，他们一共拥有一万一千多个成员，其中70％以上是中上层知识分子的代表人物。通过他们大大有助于我们党更广泛地进行团结、教育和改造知识分子的工作。这种广泛的团结共事关系，是我们当前社会主义改造和社会主义建设不断取得胜利的重要保证，这是统一战线进一步发展与巩固的重要标志。然而党和非党知识分子之间不是没有问题的。我的粗浅体会有这样几点：
    1、由于社会出身和生活经历不同而产生的宇宙观、人生观以及思想作风的不同，这里有的可以解决，有的是暂时不易解决的。但不管是否能够解决，只要政治目标一致，仍然可以不妨碍团结共事关系的。为了进一步加强这种关系，还必须靠经常的善意的批评与自我批评来逐渐前进，任何急于求成的做法是行不通的。在这方面我们上海的共产党员同志往往做得不够好。
      2、部分共产党员，还存在着残余的宗派主义情绪，因而对党外人士尊重不够，帮助不力。这种思想有时表现为态度粗鲁生硬，有时表现为“相敬如宾”、“相安无事”。党外人士反映党员们对待非党人士“客气有余”、“帮助不足”。这的确是当前团结工作的重要障碍。中共中央已经多次发出指示，督促全党加意纠正，上海党组织也已在党内外作了多次检查和教育，目前党与非党关系确有不少改善，我们还希望党外同志帮助我们继续改进缺点，并共同勉励，共同提高，建立更密切的互信互助的团结共事关系。
      3、也还有极个别人的思想状况和社会现实相差较远，因而不能不和党存在着一定的距离。比如在上海有人列举了工业建设中的某些缺点，就断然地说我们几年来的工业建设是和张之洞办厂一样，似乎是注定要全盘失败的。他甚至不能辨别张之洞时代和人民中国时代有所不同。又如有人说这几年教育事业的结论是三个字：偏、糟、乱。因此进而提出党不能领导学校、要由“教授治校”的方针。我个人认为这些意见，对我们提出批评是好的，但是他的根本观点是有问题的。要解决这些政治认识问题，看来也还要作长期艰苦的说服教育工作才能有济于事的。
    总之，团结问题我认为也是一种对立的统一，从矛盾的辩证法则来看，没有不团结也就没有团结。毛主席教导我们“从团结的愿望出发，经过批评和斗争，在新的基础上达到新的团结”，这就是我们进一步加强党与非党关系的唯一方针和我们共同奋斗的方向。
　　第四，关于调动社会知识分子力量问题。
    据去年春天的调查，上海散居在社会上的相当于高中程度以上的各种知识分子有二万四千四百余人，一年来经地方劳动部门和统战部门介绍就业的约近六千人，经过国家统一招聘已经分配工作的有一千五百七十九人。此外，去年各高等学校及技术学校大量招收的学生中也吸收了相当数量的社会青年知识分子。所以从总的情况来看，知识分子的失业无业的现象已经大大减轻了，一年来知识分子就业工作的成绩是显著的，但要彻底解决，还有不少问题：
    首先是目前未就业的知识分子有些年老体弱或无一定专长，就业条件较差的，要做到大部就业还有一定的困难。
    其次是本人思想问题没有解决，要求就业条件太高，一时不易安排。如这次统一招聘中应聘的六千零三十三人中只有八百三十四人愿意服从分配，不到应聘人数的14％，因此对这些人还要做更多的思想教育工作。
    再次是目前精简机构，就业的机会减少，把就业工作暂时放缓步骤也是必要的。
    目前我们打算从结合调整机构合理使用人才中，先个别选用一些具有真才实学、能力相当的人。一面加强对失业知识分子的教育，多方面开辟就业途径，以便一有机会就能够不因个人欲望而造成分配工作的困难；同时还要鼓励那些年老体弱的，只做一些个人轻微劳动，实事求是地贡献自己的力量，并安心于子女的赡养。对生活十分困难的人，政府已经作了生活救济，今后仍须加强这方面的工作。目前暂时埋没人才的现象势必不能避免，但是我们相信是可以逐步解决的。
　　第五，我想讲一讲大家所关心的知识分子中的肃反工作问题。
    上海肃反斗争和全国各地一样，是从反对胡风反革命集团的斗争开始的，运动之初，一般是从划清敌我思想界限入手，提高了大多数人的政治觉悟。但是思想斗争比较尖锐，受到思想批判的面也比较广一些，这就在上海的知识分子中引起了较大的震动。运动不久，当转入政治斗争的时候，我们根据党中央的明确指示，及时地严格控制了政治斗争的界限，运动的进展基本上是健康的，敌我界限，最后是完全明确的。拿上海市第一批高级知识分子的肃反运动来看，约有9％的人受到了思想批判，其中有6％的人因群众检举了各种程度不同的政治历史问题而进行了政治审查。但多数经查明无反革命罪行事实或罪行轻微的，都未做反革命处理。最后只有不足千分之七的人因罪行严重、罪证确凿受到了法律惩治。至于第二期以后的肃反斗争，由于大多数人敌我界限已经明确，掌握政策有了经验，反革命分子在群众中已经孤立以至纷纷投降自首，因而斗争的波动也就很小了。这就是肃反斗争的基本情况。这里我们应该指出的是：第一期肃反运动中那些受到政治斗争的人，当中有一部分是可以不必进行政治斗争或斗争过分了的。对于这些人事后都已经分别作了解释和道歉，有的还公开检查了运动中的缺点，以教育群众和干部，绝大多数的隔阂已经消除了。事实证明经过肃反运动以后，知识分子中的总的情况是：政治和工作积极性提高了，批评与自我批评展开了，学术辩论空气浓厚了，许多人都积极认真地制订了自己向科学进军的计划。但是，也还有极少数人，经过多次陪礼道歉仍然有所不满。我想在今后工作中，我们继续用团结互信的事实来逐渐改善这种关系，这是完全可能的。
    在党中央的正确领导下，在各友党同志们的爱护和帮助下，我作为在上海工作的一个共产党员，为了我们共同的社会主义事业，我愿意跟上海的党员同志们在一起，努力来克服自己在工作中存在的某些宗派主义、主观主义和官僚主义的思想作风，更好地和党外的同志们团结合作、共同奋斗。（附图片）
