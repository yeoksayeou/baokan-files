    Anecdotes of George Bernard Shaw
    Shaw received a representative of a film company. This person tried his best to persuade Shaw to hand over his works to them to be made into films. He talked at length for a whole hour, saying that if Shaw's art could be spread all over the world, as far as China and the non-branch islands, his great mission to mankind would be emphasized and publicized, and his thoughts would be visualized through film. Everything was talked about, except one aspect: money. Shaw interrupted him and said, "I'm afraid we're wasting time. The temperaments of the two of us are completely opposite, and as a result, we can't understand each other. You, judging from your speech, are an idealist and an artist, while I am a businessman."

    萧伯纳轶事
    萧伯纳接见了某影片公司的代表。这人竭力想说服萧把自己的作品交给他们拍成电影。他长篇大论整整扯了一个钟头，说是如果把萧的艺术传布到全球各地，远及中国及非支群岛，把他带给人类的伟大使命着重宣扬，并且通过电影使他的思想见于形象。什么都谈到了，只忘掉了一方面：钱。萧伯纳打断了他的话说：“我恐怕，咱们是在浪费时间。咱们两人气质完全相反，结果彼此没法了解。您呢，从您的谈话推测，是一位理想主义者兼艺术家，——而我呢，却是个生意人。”	  纪　琨译自德文“谐趣集”
