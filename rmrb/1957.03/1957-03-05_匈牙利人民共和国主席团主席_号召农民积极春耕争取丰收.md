Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 4th: According to TASS, the Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, Dobi, delivered a radio speech on March 3rd, calling on Hungarian farmers to actively carry out spring plowing and strive for a bumper harvest. He said that this year, as much grain as possible should be harvested from the fields. The government will provide farmers with all possible assistance in this regard. As long as farmers work hard, this year's agricultural production can achieve a bumper harvest.

Dobi said that the counter-revolutionary forces once attempted to undermine the revolutionary achievements of the working farmers—the achievements of land reform and the socialist transformation of agriculture—the production cooperatives, but thousands upon thousands of peasant masses faithfully defended the people's democratic state system. The current government leadership has basically eliminated, and will continue to eliminate, the consequences of past erroneous policies in agriculture. Since we are building a socialist country, there can be no other goal in agriculture other than building socialism.

Dobi said that the state will provide material assistance to farmers, especially to production cooperatives, but any practice of forcing farmers to join cooperatives is incompatible with the government's policy. The state will also provide individual farmers with the greatest possible assistance, thereby increasing the production of individual agriculture.

    匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席
    号召农民积极春耕争取丰收
    新华社4日讯  据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席道比3日发表广播演说，号召匈牙利农民积极展开春耕工作，努力争取丰收。他说，在今年，应该从田地里收获尽可能多的谷物。政府在这方面将向农民提供一切可能的帮助。只要农民努力，今年的农业生产是可以获得丰收的。
    道比说，反革命势力曾经企图破坏劳动农民的革命成果——土地改革和农业社会主义改造的成果——生产合作社，可是千千万万的农民群众忠实地捍卫了人民民主的国家制度。现在的政府领导基本上已经消除，并且还将继续消除过去在农业方面的错误政策所造成的后果。既然我们建设的是社会主义国家，因此在农业方面，除了建成社会主义以外，不可能有其他目的。
    道比说，国家将给予农民，首先是给予生产合作社物质援助，但是任何强迫农民加入合作社的作法都是和政府的政策不相容的。国家也将给予个体农民以最大限度的帮助，从而提高个体农业的生产。
