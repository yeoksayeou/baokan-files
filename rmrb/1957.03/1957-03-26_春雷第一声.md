　　“The First Thunderclap of Spring”
　　By Our Correspondent Wang Changlong

　　At the recent rural work conference held by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the majority of cadres were in high spirits and full of confidence in striving for a bumper harvest this year. However, some cadres from areas with consecutive years of good harvests lacked confidence in achieving another bumper harvest this year, saying things like "Good land cannot yield again, there's no more to increase." For example, Huang Guangquan, Secretary of the Puhuo District Committee of the Communist Party in Guangshan County, said: "Striving for a great bumper harvest in 1957 is very important, but judging from the situation in our district, we've had bumper harvests for two consecutive years, and the potential for increased production is not great!" Some cadres from low-lying, flood-prone areas also emphasized the great difficulties in striving for a bumper harvest this year. For example, Anyang County was severely affected by disasters last year, and cadres, when discussing how to strive for a bumper harvest this year, all talked about the many difficulties. The county party committee was also burdened with a fear of difficulties. Zhaojiayao Township in this county had a per-mu yield of 120 jin of summer dryland wheat last year, but the wheat production plan set for this year is only 50 jin. These negative and shrinking thoughts and emotions are major obstacles to striving to achieve a bumper harvest this year.

　　What is the root cause of this negative sentiment? The analysis of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is that it comes from two aspects: First, in some areas, the Party's leadership has not sufficiently protected the socialist enthusiasm of cadres and the masses. Whether in rural political work, in the guiding ideology for rectifying the cooperatives, or in the publicity and reporting of rural conditions, there has been a varying degree of neglect in positively summarizing the great achievements since the transition to advanced cooperatives and in summarizing and promoting advanced technologies and agricultural capital construction's positive role in increasing production. Instead, there has been too much fault-finding. Shortcomings that cadres and the masses have already recognized, corrected, or are in the process of correcting are still endlessly criticized. This has created complaints, doubts, and pessimistic arguments among some people, who dare not continue to move forward with big strides. On the other hand, some cadres have developed a slackening mentality in the face of the great victories of the socialist revolution and lack ideological preparation for new problems that may arise after cooperation, which has also caused unnecessary losses in work; some are intentionally or unintentionally standing on the position of well-to-do middle peasants, complaining on their behalf, and even demanding that things be done according to their intentions. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also pointed out that the above-mentioned negative sentiments were noticed last winter, attention was paid to them, and political work was strengthened. The above analysis hits the ideological key points of the cadres, which is beneficial to enhancing their ideological understanding and socialist enthusiasm.

　　Correctly Understanding the Rural Situation

　　The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party regards striving for a bumper harvest this year and mobilizing the enthusiasm of cadres as "the first thunderclap of spring." When addressing the negative emotions of cadres, the provincial committee focused on enabling the more than 1,800 cadres participating in the meeting to conduct a comprehensive analysis and discussion of the rural situation in conjunction with studying the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions on striving for a bumper harvest.

　　Henan Province suffered severe natural disasters last year, but according to statistics from 71 counties and the suburbs of Luoyang, more than 4,000 cooperatives still achieved an average yield of more than 300 jin per mu of grain, with nearly half of them achieving high yields of 400 jin to 1,000 jin or more per mu. In the Xinxiang area, which was more severely affected by disasters, more than 59% of cooperative members still had incomes exceeding those of the bumper year of 1955. On average, agricultural cooperatives throughout the province accumulated more than 7,000 yuan worth of public property last year. During the rectification of cooperatives, the practices of contracting work and output to work teams and establishing and improving the internal financial system were widely implemented, and the internal management of cooperatives has gradually become regularized, and the ideological foundation of the cooperatives is becoming increasingly consolidated. The most prominent feature is that the province vigorously carried out basic farmland water conservancy construction and agricultural technology reform last year. Last year, the province dug wells, developed springs, built reservoirs, and repaired ponds, dikes, and dams, which, based on the project's benefits, increased the average amount of irrigated land per farmer by more than six fen; in terms of technological reform, the province universally strengthened technical guidance on cotton field management, especially strengthening the technical transmission to low-yield cotton areas. Last year, the province organized more than 300 experienced cotton growers from old cotton-growing areas to conduct technical instruction in the low-yield areas of the Nanyang Prefecture, which began to increase yields in the low-yield cotton areas. In Nanyang, Xinye, Dengxian, and other nine counties, there were more than one million mu of cotton fields that had historically only produced about ten jin of ginned cotton per mu. Last year, after technical instruction, the average yield reached more than 24 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of more than double the average of 1956. Through discussion of the above facts, cadres comprehensively and correctly understood the current rural situation and strengthened their confidence in striving for a bumper harvest this year.

　　Relying on the Masses to Overcome Difficulties

　　Of course, this does not mean that there are no difficulties in striving for a bumper harvest this year. For example, some areas of Henan Province are currently threatened by drought, and wheat growth is poor in some areas, which requires mobilizing the masses to carry out spring irrigation and topdressing; disaster areas still have difficulties in terms of means of production and living materials, the phenomenon of livestock deaths in some areas has not yet stopped, and there are still some third-category cooperatives that have not been well rectified, all of which require strengthening work and solving practical difficulties. But it should be recognized that these are difficulties in the course of advancement. As long as the masses are informed, mobilized, and relied upon, all difficulties can be overcome.

　　Huaibin County is a famous low-lying, flood-prone area in Henan Province, and it is also an area with large areas of accumulated water and severe disasters year after year. However, the county party committee of the Chinese Communist Party in this county did not bow its head in the face of difficulties in striving for a bumper harvest. They went deep among the masses to visit and summarize the masses' experience in increasing production. They found that the reeds, cogongrass, twigs, and branches planted by the Bangshan Agricultural Cooperative last year were submerged by floods for three months. After the water receded, they seized the opportunity to cultivate and manage them and still harvested a lot. After processing, they sold them for more than 13,000 yuan, and the cooperative members were very satisfied. The county party committee summarized the experience of this cooperative and planned to plant all the more than 100,000 mu of low-lying, flood-prone areas in the county that are not guaranteed a harvest with flood-resistant crops within three years. Comrade Shi Shaoju, the county party secretary, said with confidence: "The population in our county's low-lying, flood-prone areas that are not guaranteed a harvest is about 70,000. If we strengthen leadership in the future and implement the plan to change to planting flood-resistant crops, the average income per person will be more than 34 yuan in 1957, more than 141 yuan in 1958, and more than 298 yuan in 1959. At that time, we will change the current situation where the vast majority of cooperative members say: 'The land does not yield, the government provides relief, the country spends money, and the masses suffer,' and we will completely eliminate the threat of waterlogging disasters." Isn't this pointing out a path to a bumper harvest for low-lying, flood-affected areas?

　　Now let's take a look at the situation of the Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative in Neixiang County, which has had bumper harvests for consecutive years. The production increase of this cooperative is as follows: 13.47% in 1952, 14.93% in 1953, 1.6% in 1954, 28.97% in 1955, and after the realization of cooperation in 1956, it still increased by an average of 42% despite the attack of severe natural disasters. The main experience of this cooperative in increasing production is that they converted 120 mu of depression land into paddy fields, increasing the yield per mu from 56 jin to 400 jin; and they changed 200 mu of clay soil and 550 mu of sandy soil by mixing in sand, increasing the average yield per mu by 70 jin to 85 jin, more than doubling the increase compared to 1955.

　　The Party branch of this cooperative has also strengthened its leadership over production, summarizing the experience of veteran farmers and promoting new technologies, so that the leadership is combined with the masses. Now, on the basis of what they already have, after finding favorable conditions and making specific calculations, this cooperative has also formulated a plan to increase production to 700 jin per mu in 1957. Isn't this also pointing out a path to increased production for areas with consecutive years of good harvests?

　　The Thunderclap of Spring Has Sounded

　　After the rich experience of increasing production in various places was exchanged in an organized manner at the Henan Provincial Rural Work Conference, all counties happily accepted the production increase plan targets proposed by the province. Many counties that originally had low production plans automatically made revisions, and some even greatly exceeded the production plan targets of the province. For example, Xinye County originally planned to produce 38 jin of cotton per mu this year. After the exchange of experience, the cotton yield per mu was increased to 45 jin. The wheat production plan of Neixiang County was increased from 180 jin per mu to 200 jin. After clearing away negative emotions, Guangshan County decided to launch a high-yield competition movement throughout the county, striving to increase agricultural production throughout the county by more than 10% compared to last year. According to the statistics of the 38 counties that formulated plans at this meeting, this year, in terms of grain production, there will be 3,480 high-yield cooperatives with an average yield of 400 jin to 700 jin or more per mu, covering an area of more than 7 million mu; in terms of cotton production, there will be 2,510 high-yield cooperatives with an average yield of 40 jin to 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, covering an area of more than 2.4 million mu.

　　The "first thunderclap of spring" in Henan Province has sounded. In the future, it is even more necessary to continue to move forward on this victorious basis!

　　“春雷第一声”
　　本报记者　王昌隆
    在中共河南省委最近召开的农村工作会议上，大多数干部对争取今年丰收的情绪很高，信心很足。可是，也有些连年丰收地区的干部对争取今年丰收没有信心，说什么“良田无再收，无产可增。”如中共光山县泼河区区委书记黄光全说：“争取1957年大丰收很重要，但从我区情况看，连着两年丰收，增产潜力不大了！”还有些低凹易涝地区的干部，强调争取今年丰收困难大。如安阳县去年是重灾县，干部在讨论如何争取今年丰收时，都说困难多。县委也背着怕困难的思想包袱。这个县的赵家窑乡去年夏季旱地小麦每亩单产一百二十斤，而今年订的小麦生产计划只有五十斤。这些消极退缩的思想情绪，是争取实现今年丰收的重大障碍。
    产生这种消极情绪的根源在那里呢？中共河南省委的分析是来自两方面：一是由于有些地区党的领导上，对于干部和群众的社会主义积极性保护不够，不论在农村政治工作方面，在对于整社的指导思想方面，以及对农村情况的宣传报道方面，都不同程度地忽视了从正面总结转高级社以来的巨大成绩，总结推行先进技术和进行农业基本建设对于增产的积极作用。而是过多地挑剔缺点，对于干部和群众已经认识、改正或正在改正的缺点，仍然无休止地指责，这就在一部分人中间产生了抱怨、怀疑和悲观的论调，不敢大踏步地继续前进。另一方面，则是由于有一些干部；在社会主义革命巨大胜利的面前，产生松气思想，对于合作化以后可能发生的新问题，缺乏思想准备，也造成工作中不应有的损失；有的则是有意无意地站到富裕中农的立场上，替富裕中农叫苦，甚至要求根据他们的意图办事。中共河南省委也同时指出：对于上述消极情绪，去冬就有所察觉，引起了重视，加强了政治工作。上述分析，是击中了干部的思想要害，这对提高干部思想认识，提高社会主义积极性是有益的。
    正确认识农村形势
    中共河南省委把争取今年丰收，调动干部积极性，看做是“春雷第一声”。省委在解决干部消极情绪时，着重使参加会议的一千八百多个干部，结合学习中央争取大丰收指示的精神，对农村形势进行全面分析和讨论。
    河南省去年自然灾害很严重，但据七十一个县和洛阳市郊区统计，仍有四千多个社粮食每亩平均产量达到了三百斤以上，其中将近一半的社每亩平均产量达到了四百斤到一千斤以上的高额产量。灾情比较严重的新乡专区，还有59％以上的社员收入超过了丰收的1955年。全省一般农业社去年平均积累了价值在七千元以上的公共财产；在整社中，各地又普遍推行了包工包产、建立和健全了社内的财务制度，社内经营管理已经逐渐走上了正轨，社的思想基础日趋巩固。最突出的是全省去年大力进行了农田水利基本建设和农业技术改革。全省去年打井，下泉，修水库，修塘、堰、坝等，按工程效益使全省农民每人平均增加了六分多水地；在技术改革上，全省普遍加强了对棉田管理的技术指导，特别是加强了对棉花低产区的技术传授。去年省里曾组织老棉区植棉能手三百多人，到南阳专区低产区进行技术传授，使棉花低产区开始提高了产量。南阳、新野、邓县等九个县共有一百多万亩棉田，历年每亩只产皮棉十斤左右，去年经过技术传授，平均亩产达到皮棉二十四斤多，比1956年平均增产一倍以上。通过对以上事实的讨论，使干部全面、正确地认识了当前农村形势，增强了争取今年大丰收的信心。
    依靠群众克服困难
    当然啦，这还不是说争取今年丰收，就没有困难了。像河南省当前部分地区有干旱威胁，部分地区小麦生长不好，这就需要发动群众进行春浇和施追肥；灾区在生产资料和生活资料上还有困难，部分地区牲口死亡现象尚未停止，以及还有一部分三类社没有经过很好整顿，这都需要加强工作，解决实际困难。但应该认识这是前进中的困难，只要向群众说明，动员群众和依靠群众，一切困难都是可以克服的。
    淮滨县是河南省有名的低凹易涝地区，也是连年积水面积大，灾情重的地区。但这个县的中共县委并没有在争取丰收的困难面前低头。他们深入群众访问和总结群众的增产经验，发现去年蚌山农业社种植的苇子、荻子、条子、杈子，被洪水埋头三个月，水后抓紧培植管理，还收了很多，加工后共卖款一万三千多元，社员们很满意。县委就总结了这个社的经验，计划全县在十万余亩不保收的低凹易涝地区，三年内全部种上耐涝作物。县委书记石绍举同志有信心的说：“我们全县不保收的低凹易涝地区人口约七万人，今后加强领导，按改种耐涝作物计划实现后，1957年每人平均可收入三十四元多，1958年可收入一百四十一元多，1959年可收入二百九十八元多。那时就会改变现在广大社员所说的：‘地里不收，政府救济，国家花钱，群众受罪’的状况，就会彻底消灭易涝灾害的威胁。”这里不正是给低凹易涝受灾地区指出了一条丰收道路吗？
    现在再看看连年丰收的内乡县新华农业社的情况吧。这个社的生产递增情况是：1952年增产13.47％，1953年增产14.93％，1954年增产1.6％，1955年增产28.97％，1956年实现合作化后，虽在严重自然灾害的袭击下，仍然平均增产42％。这个社的增产经验，主要是他们将一百二十亩凹地改为水田，每亩产量由五十六斤增加到四百斤；并以掺沙的办法改变了二百亩粘土地和五百五十亩沙土地，每亩平均增产七十斤至八十五斤，较1955年增产一倍。
    这个社的党支部还加强了对生产的领导，总结老农经验，推广新的技术，使领导与群众相结合。现在这个社在已有的基础上，经过找有利条件和具体计算，又制订出1957年每亩产七百斤的增产计划。这里不是又给连年丰收地区指出了一条增产的道路吗？
        春雷打响了
    在河南省农村工作会议上，有组织地把各地这些丰富的增产经验交流以后，各县都愉快的接受了省里所提出的增产计划指标，不少县原来生产计划偏低的都自动作了修改，有的还大大超过了省里的生产计划指标。例如新野县原来计划今年棉花亩产三十八斤，经过经验交流后，将棉花亩产提高到四十五斤。内乡县小麦生产计划，由原来的亩产一百八十斤，提高到二百斤。光山县经过清除消极情绪后，确定在全县范围内开展丰产竞赛运动，争取使全县农业生产比去年增产一成以上。据这次会议上制订计划的三十八个县的统计，今年在粮食生产上，平均亩产达到四百斤到七百斤以上的丰产社三千四百八十个，面积七百多万亩；在棉花生产上，平均亩产皮棉四十斤到一百斤的丰产社二千五百一十个，面积二百四十多万亩。
    河南省的“春雷第一声”是打响了。今后更有待于在这个胜利的基础上继续前进！
