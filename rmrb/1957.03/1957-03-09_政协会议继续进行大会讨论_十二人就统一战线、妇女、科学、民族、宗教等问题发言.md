Xinhua News Agency, March 8th. Yang Zhihua, Head of the Women Workers' Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, today at the Third Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, called on women and people throughout the country to inherit the revolutionary tradition of hard work and plain living, overcome various difficulties, and complete the arduous task of building a socialist society.

Today is International Women's Day, and the conference extended warm congratulations to all the women attending the meeting. Four female members spoke today: Yang Zhihua, Li Jiansheng, Sun Ruizhi, and Ding Guoxian. Their speeches were warmly welcomed.

In her speech, Yang Zhihua gave a detailed account of the revolutionary spirit of hard work and plain living of the female revolutionary Xiang Jingyu. She said that now that we have won, we must not forget Xiang Jingyu's unwavering will to devote her life to the cause of communism; we must not forget her spirit of not seeking empty fame and doing practical work; we must not forget her work style of hard work, plain living, and down-to-earth effort; and we must not forget her enthusiastic, diligent, studious, and tireless spirit.

Li Jiansheng, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau, expressed her views on the issue of birth control. She agreed that a special agency should be established to study and guide birth control work. She said that birth control should not be seen as a matter for women alone, and that education should be conducted among young and middle-aged men first. Li Jiansheng said that a new trend of advocating late marriage and opposing early marriage should be launched. She also said that sterilization and induced abortion should be used as auxiliary methods of contraception only as a last resort.

Sun Ruizhi, a family member of railway workers and a newly added member of the CPPCC National Committee, said that although family work is not direct production work, it is like a screw; without it, the big wheel will be affected. Therefore, family work must be oriented towards production. She hoped that leaders of all departments would pay attention to and support family work.

Ding Guoxian, a famous Jin opera actress, said that since the central government put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," all forty-three opera genres in Shanxi Province have blossomed. However, she pointed out that various troupes have not done enough to go deep into factories and rural areas to perform for workers and peasants, and some troupes still like extravagance. She said that in the future, we must perform diligently and frugally and perform well.

Eight other members and attendees spoke at today's meeting.

Zhang Zhizhong, in his speech, expressed his complete agreement with Premier Zhou's analysis of the current international situation and China's foreign policy. He focused on the relationship between the Communist Party of China and non-Party members. He cited many facts to illustrate that, due to the correct implementation of the united front policy by the Communist Party of China, non-Party members have benefited immensely. However, there are still problems in the relationship between the Party and non-Party members in terms of having position, authority, and responsibility, in terms of understanding and implementing the united front policy, and in terms of the friendly cooperation between Communist Party members and non-Party members. He believes that to improve the relationship between the Party and non-Party members, first, it is necessary to clearly understand from an ideological perspective the principle that Communist Party members and non-Party members must work together, supervise each other, and make progress together for a long time in order to complete arduous tasks. Second, guarantees must be sought from the system, the effective method of criticism and self-criticism must be institutionalized, the system of consultation on matters must be adhered to, and the system of combining collective leadership with individual responsibility must be implemented. Third, feelings must be cultivated in life and interactions. Fourth, the united front policy must be implemented by strengthening learning, strengthening propaganda and education, and strengthening inspection work.

Ma Dayou said in his speech that the blueprint of the national twelve-year science development plan gives scientists full confidence and prevents them from losing their way. He believes that there are still problems with how scientific research units can better divide labor and cooperate, with the duplication of research institutions, and with the failure of senior scientific personnel to fully utilize their expertise. Therefore, it is necessary for the government to strengthen its leadership over scientific work.

Ma Kunshan, who attended this plenary session as an observer, used the various achievements of regional autonomy in the three Hui autonomous prefectures of Wu Zhong, Gu Yuan, and Lin Xia in Gansu Province to illustrate the correct implementation of the Party's ethnic policy. He hopes that a Hui autonomous region will be established in northeastern Gansu as soon as possible; continue to boldly select ethnic minority cadres, especially technical cadres; and pay attention to the key development of industry in ethnic minority areas.

Chen Diaofu said that scientific workers are now advancing on three battlefields, which can be called the three armies of the scientific community: the basic science army, composed of comrades engaged in research work in the Chinese Academy of Sciences and various research institutions; the teaching army, composed of those engaged in teaching work in universities and colleges; and the production army, composed of those engaged in production work in factories and mines. He said that the three armies should communicate with each other, help each other, and learn from each other.

Gui Linqi, who attended this plenary session as an observer, spoke about the agricultural cooperativization situation in Anhui. He said that the natural disasters suffered by Anhui Province last year far exceeded those of 1954 in scope. However, because the organized farmers gave full play to the collective strength and went through arduous struggles, the losses from the disaster were greatly reduced. The total grain output of the province in 1956 exceeded the level of the bumper harvest of 1955. Gui Linqi also pointed out some shortcomings and errors in the socialist transformation of agriculture. He said that the vast majority of farmers regard these problems as "everything is difficult at the beginning," and that they occurred in the absence of experience, and many were unavoidable.

Wu Yaozong spoke on the issue of implementing religious policy. He said that in recent years the government has provided many specific help to the needs of the Chinese Christian Church. Some churches have built new churches, and some churches have ordained new pastors and bishops. Many believers have become people's representatives and CPPCC members. Many local cadres also often care about church work. However, he cited some examples to show that the implementation of religious policy is not without problems. He raised objections to the phenomenon of some publications ignoring the positive aspects of the patriotic and peace-loving nature of religious circles in China when criticizing religion. Wu Yaozong hopes that the relevant departments of the central government and the people's committees at all levels will pay more attention to religious work and conduct more publicity and education on the policy of freedom of religious belief. He hopes that the relevant departments of the central government will consider formulating some supplementary provisions related to the implementation of religious policy based on the provisions of the Constitution regarding freedom of religious belief.

Wang Jialie, who attended this plenary session as an observer, said in his speech that he used to be an old warlord who occupied a territory and even blocked the Red Army from heading north when the Red Army passed through Guizhou during the Long March. However, after he embarked on the revolutionary path, he not only received the care of the government and the Party, but also his work and life were properly arranged. He said that this fact fully illustrates that as long as a person can return to the people and support the revolution, the Party and the People's Government will not hold the past against them. He hopes that the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan will make a decisive decision and take practical actions to respond to Premier Zhou Enlai's call and strive to return Taiwan to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible.

Yang Xinxiang, who attended this plenary session as an observer, introduced the work situation and work experience of the Huzhou City Committee of the CPPCC Zhejiang Province in his speech.

Today's meeting ended at 6:25 p.m. The morning meeting was held in group discussions. The meeting will continue tomorrow.

    政协会议继续进行大会讨论
    十二人就统一战线、妇女、科学、民族、宗教等问题发言
    据新华社8日讯　中华全国总工会女工部长杨之华今天下午在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第三次全体会议上号召全国妇女、全国人民继承艰苦朴素的革命传统，克服各种困难，完成建设社会主义社会的艰巨事业。
    今天是“三八”节，大会向参加会议的全体妇女表示热烈的祝贺。今天有四位女委员发言。她们是杨之华、李健生、孙瑞芝和丁果仙。她们的发言都受到热烈的欢迎。
    杨之华在发言中详细介绍了女革命家向警予同志艰苦朴素的革命精神。她说，我们胜利了，不要忘记向警予同志那种毕生为共产主义事业忘我劳动坚定不移的意志；不要忘记她那种不务虚名、会干实事的品质；不要忘记她那种艰苦朴素、脚踏实地的工作作风；不要忘记她那种热情奔放、勤勤恳恳、学而不厌、诲人不倦的精神。
    北京市公共卫生局副局长李健生就节育问题发表了意见。她赞成成立一个专门机构来研究和指导节育的工作。她说，不能把节育看作是妇女一方面的事，当前首先应向青年和中年男子进行教育。李健生说，应该掀起提倡迟婚，反对早婚的新风气。她还说，绝育手术和人工流产应该是避孕措施中的一种辅助办法，非万不得已不做。
    铁路职工家属、新增加的政协委员孙瑞芝说，家属工作虽然不是直接生产工作，但是它就像螺丝钉一样，没有它也会影响大轮子转，因此家属工作必须面向生产。她希望各部门的领导人都要重视和支持家属工作。
    晋剧著名演员丁果仙谈到，中央提出百花齐放、百家争鸣以后，山西全省的四十三个剧种都已开花结果。但是，她指出，各剧团对深入工厂和农村为工农演出作得不够，有一些剧团还好铺张。她说，今后我们要勤俭演戏，把戏演好。
    今天大会上还有八位委员和列席人员发了言。
    张治中在发言中表示完全赞同周总理对于目前国际形势和我国外交政策的分析。他着重谈到了中国共产党和党外人士的关系问题。他列举许多事实说明，由于中国共产党正确地贯彻了统一战线政策，使非党人士得到了无数的好处。但是在有职有权有责问题上，在对统战政策的认识与执行方法问题上，在共产党员与非党人士的友好合作问题上，党与非党的关系还有问题。他认为，要搞好党与非党的关系，第一需要从思想上认识清楚共产党员和党外人士长期共事合作，互相监督，共同进步，才能完成繁重任务的道理。第二要从制度上求得保证，把批评和自我批评的有效方法制度化，坚持遇事协商的制度，贯彻集体领导与分工负责相结合的制度。第三要从生活和交往上培养感情。第四要从加强学习、加强宣传教育和加强检查工作上贯彻统战政策。
    马大猷在发言中说，国家十二年科学发展规划的蓝图，使科学家们具有充分的信心，不致迷失方向。他认为，目前还存在着各科学研究单位如何更好地分工合作的问题，存在着研究机构设置重复的问题，存在着高级科学人员未能充分发挥专长的问题。因此有必要请政府加强对科学工作的领导。
    列席这次全体会议的马昆山，以甘肃省的吴忠、固原、临夏三个回族自治州实行区域自治的各种成果，来说明党的民族政策的正确实施。他希望早日在甘肃东北部成立回族自治区；继续大胆选拔少数民族干部特别是技术干部；注意在少数民族地区重点发展工业。
    陈调甫说，现在科学工作者正在三个战场上进军，可称为科学界的三军，这就是：基本科学军，以在科学院及各研究机构中从事研究工作的同志组成；教学军，以在高等院校、专科学校从事教学工作的同志组成；生产军，以在厂矿从事生产的同志组成。他说，三军之间应互通声息、互相帮助、互相学习。
    列席这次全体会议的桂林栖就安徽的农业合作化情况发言。他说，去年安徽省遭受的自然灾害，广度大大超过了1954年。但因组织起来的农民充分发挥了集体的力量，经过顽强斗争，终于大大减轻了受灾的损失。全省1956年的粮食总产量超过了丰收的1955年的水平。桂林栖还指出了农业社会主义改造中的一些缺点和错误。他说：绝大多数农民都把这些问题看作是“万事起头难”，是在没有经验的情况下发生的，有许多是难免的。
    吴耀宗就贯彻宗教政策问题发言。他说，这几年来政府对中国基督教会的需要给予了许多具体的帮助。有的教会建筑了新的礼拜堂，有的教会按立了新的牧师和主教。许多信徒做了人民代表和政协委员。许多地方干部也经常关怀教会工作。但是，他举出一些事例，说明宗教政策的执行并不是没有问题的。他对于某些出版物在批判宗教时忽视我国宗教界爱祖国、爱和平的积极一面的现象，提出了意见。吴耀宗希望中央有关部门和各级人民委员会更加重视宗教工作，对宗教信仰自由政策作更多的宣传教育。他希望中央有关部门根据宪法关于宗教信仰自由的条文规定，考虑制订一些与贯彻宗教政策有关的补充条文。
    列席这次全体会议的王家烈在发言中说，他过去是一个割据一方的旧军人，当红军长征路过贵州时，竟阻挡红军北上。但是，当他走向革命大道以后，不仅得到了政府和党的关怀，而且他的工作和生活都得到了适当的安排。他说，这个事实充分说明，只要一个人能够归向人民，拥护革命，党和人民政府是既往不咎的。他希望在台湾的国民党军政人员当机立断，以实际行动，响应周恩来总理的号召，争取早日使台湾回到祖国的怀抱。
    列席这次全体会议的杨莘相在发言中介绍了政协浙江省湖州市委员会的工作情况和工作经验。
    今天的会议在下午六时二十五分结束。上午会议进行了分组讨论。明天会议将继续举行。
