Xinhua News Agency News: Zhejiang Province plans to plant over 11 million mu of double-season rice this year, accounting for more than 40% of the total rice area; an increase of about one million mu compared with last year when large-scale changes were implemented. Among them, the planting area of continuous double-season rice will reach more than 6 million mu, no less than the planting area of last year.
    This plan was formulated by various special districts in Zhejiang Province based on the experience and lessons learned from expanding the planting of double-season rice last year, and by adapting to local conditions. Last year was a year of large-scale promotion of double-season rice in Zhejiang Province. The planting area of continuous double-season rice alone increased by nearly seven times compared with 1955. Although this year suffered severe natural disasters such as typhoons, droughts, and floods, significant yield increases were still achieved. According to relevant departments, the expansion of double-season rice increased rice production by approximately one billion jin. However, a few areas did not pay enough attention to the fact that planting double-season rice requires more labor, water conservancy, and fertilizer, and promoted it a bit too much. Some agricultural cooperatives planted too much, which delayed the harvesting and transplanting seasons, affecting yields. Based on this situation, the provincial agricultural department and various special districts paid close attention to local conditions when formulating this year's double-season rice planting plan. An appropriate survey was also conducted on the ratio of continuous double-season rice, which requires more labor, and intercropping double-season rice, which requires less labor. In the Hang (County), Jia (Xing), and Hu (Zhou) areas, where soil, fertility, and water conservancy conditions are better, the double-season rice area will be increased by more than 300,000 mu this year; in the Ning (Bo), Shao (Xing), Wen (Zhou), and Tai (Zhou) areas, according to last year's situation, the planting area of continuous double-season rice has been reduced, and a portion of intercropping rice has been expanded, but the total double-season rice area in these areas is still much larger than last year.

    浙江省计划种植双季稻一千多万亩
    新华社讯  浙江省今年计划种植双季稻一千一百多万亩，占水稻总面积40％以上；比大面积改制的去年还增加一百万亩左右。其中连作双季稻的种植面积将达六百多万亩，不下于去年的种植面积。
    这个计划是浙江省各个专区根据去年扩种双季稻的经验教训因地制宜地制订出来的。去年是浙江省大面积推广双季稻的一年，仅连作双季稻的种植面积就比1955年增加近七倍。这一年虽然遭受了台风、干旱、雨涝等严重自然灾害的袭击，但仍然获得显著增产。据有关部门计算，扩种双季稻一项共增产稻谷十亿斤左右。但是，有少数地区对种植双季稻需要较多的劳力、水利、肥料等这一情况注意不够，推广得多了一点。有些农业社种得太多，耽误了收割和插秧季节，影响了产量。根据这种情况，省农业部门和各个专区，在制订今年双季稻的种植计划时，都很注意当地的各种条件。对花费工夫较多的连作双季稻和花工较少的间作双季稻的比例也作了适当调查。在土壤、肥力和水利条件较好的杭（县）、嘉（兴）、湖（州）地区，今年增加双季稻面积三十多万亩；在宁（波）、绍（兴）、温（州）、台（州）地区，根据去年情况，连作双季稻种植面积有所缩减，扩大了一部分间作稻，但这些地区双季稻总面积仍比去年增加许多。
