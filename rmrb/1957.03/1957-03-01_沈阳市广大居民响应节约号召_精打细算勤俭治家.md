    Shenyang City Residents Respond to Call for Thrift
    Meticulous Planning and Frugal Housekeeping
    (Our dispatch) According to Shenyang Daily news: Broad residents of various districts in Shenyang City are responding to the government's call, managing their households diligently and thriftily, and saving money.
    Residents of Tiexi District are most active in household economy. Since the Tiexi District People's Committee began promoting thrift among residents at the beginning of this year, many household management experts have emerged throughout the district. In the Niuxintun Metallurgical Plant family dormitory in the district, 46 households of employees' families have all made living plans.
    Many housewives have planned very carefully in terms of saving coal, grain, and oil. Wang Suqing, a resident of Guihe Street, used two very interesting rural sayings to illustrate the importance of daily thrift: "Three years of hard meals will sell an ox, three years of bad meals will buy an ox." She is very particular about using low heat to simmer rice; the rice she makes has no crust, is delicious, and yields a lot. She is also very economical with coal, and 200 jin of medium-grade coal per month is enough. Wang Suqing pays attention to saving oil every time she stir-fries – even a little drop of oil. In the past year, she saved 12 jin of soybean oil. Eight households on Guihe Street have made family savings plans, expecting to save 15 jin of grain, 500 jin of coal, and 65 jin of firewood per month. They also proposed: no crust when cooking rice, no rice grains lost when washing rice, burning more coal briquettes, and using less firewood to start the fire.
    When planning family expenses, many housewives often hold family meetings to discuss together and avoid disputes. Most residents of the second residential group of the second residents' committee of Guancheng Street, Dadong District, held family meetings around February 15 and made living plans. Shen Shufang, a resident of Jixian Street, Heping District, is praised by everyone as a household management expert. Her household management method is: uniting everyone to overcome difficulties, saving money as much as possible, and avoiding buying things that can be avoided. During the Spring Festival this year, she originally planned to buy a few feet of floral cloth to make a dress for her younger sister, but after calculating: there are clothes to wear now, and the stores are crowded during the Spring Festival, so she discussed it with her younger sister and decided not to make the dress for the time being, and save the money. Last summer, she went to the railway clinic for a physical examination. It only cost eight cents to take the tram, which was nothing, but Shen Shufang thought, saving money to buy vegetables, so she decided not to take the tram and walked to the hospital like a stroll, which was both pleasant and saved money. Shen Shufang now has half a year's savings deposit in the bank again, and she plans to use the money saved to buy a bicycle for her husband in August or September this year. Yang Yanjun, of Guangming Street, Dadong District, is the mother of eight children. Her family has ten people and a monthly income of 90 yuan. She presides over a family meeting once a month, and everyone discusses and plans the main expenses of the family. Because she plans well, the whole family can still improve their lives a few times a month and save four yuan a month.
    The Zhulin Street Office in Dadong District recently convened a forum for residents to help them arrange their lives. Many residents are living more planned lives than before.

    沈阳市广大居民响应节约号召
    精打细算勤俭治家
    本报讯  据沈阳日报消息：沈阳市各区广大街道居民响应政府号召，勤俭治家，节约储蓄。
    铁西区居民的家庭节约搞得最活跃。铁西区人民委员会自从今年年初开始在居民中宣传节约以后，全区出现了许多治家能手。该区牛心屯冶炼厂家属宿舍四十六户职工家属，都订了生活计划。
    许多家庭主妇，在节约煤、粮、油等方面计划得很周到。贵和街居民王素清曾用两句很有趣的农村俗语说明日常节约的重要：“三年硬饭卖头牛，三年烂饭买头牛”。她很讲究压火焖饭；她做出的饭没有锅巴，又好吃又出饭。烧煤也很节省，每月二百斤中等煤就够了。王素清每次炒菜都注意节约油，——那怕是一点一滴油。在去年一年中她节约了十二斤豆油。贵和街有八户居民订出了家庭节约计划，预计每月能节约十五斤粮、五百斤煤和六十五斤劈柴。她们也提出：做饭不出锅巴，淘米不掉米粒，多烧煤坯，少用劈柴引火。
    许多家庭主妇在计划家庭开支的时候，常常召开家庭会议，共同商量，避免纠纷。大东区管城街第二居民委员会第二居民组，大部分居民都在2月15日前后开了家庭会议，订了生活计划。和平区集贤街居民申淑芳，人们都夸她是治家能手。她的治家方法是：团结大家克服困难，可以节省的钱就尽量节省，可以不买的东西就尽量不买。今年春节期间，本来打算买几尺花布给小妹妹做件衣服，后来一核计：目前有衣服穿，再说春节期间商店也拥挤，于是就和小妹妹商量，决定暂不做衣服，把钱储蓄起来。去年夏天，她到铁路门诊所去检查身体，本来乘电车只需八分钱，算不了啥，可是申淑芳一想，省下钱买蔬菜，于是她决定不乘电车，像散步一样地走到医院，又愉快又省钱。申淑芳现在在银行里又有半年的储蓄存款了，她计划在今年8、9月间，用节省的钱给丈夫买一辆自行车。大东区光明街杨彦君是八个孩子的妈妈。她家里有十口人，每月收入九十元。她每月主持召开家庭会议一次，大家商量，计划家庭的各项主要开支。由于她计划得好，全家每月还能改善几回生活，每月能储蓄四元钱。
    大东区珠林街办事处，不久以前曾召集居民开了个座谈会，帮助她们安排生活。许多居民过日子也比以前更有计划了。
