Opinions on Comrade Chen Qitong et al.'s "Opinions"
    Chen Liao

    After the article "Our Opinions on Several Aspects of Current Literary Work" co-authored by Comrades Chen Qitong, Chen Yading, Ma Hanbing, and Lu Le was published in the People's Daily on January 7, I read it repeatedly with great interest. I think there are many valuable opinions in it, which are beneficial to the current literary work. For example, we should actively promote the literary direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and the creative method of socialist realism; we should create more and better works with the theme of modern people's struggle life. These opinions are all good. However, Chen Qitong et al.'s "Opinions" also contain some incorrect opinions, which can be attributed to a one-sided and therefore incorrect assessment of the current literary work, that is, the literary work after the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" last year. Since Chen Qitong et al.'s assessment of the current state of literary work is basically wrong, the above-mentioned opinions that are correct in principle (which they put forward on the basis of their assessment of the current state of literary work) are greatly weakened in their persuasiveness. Moreover, some of Chen Qitong et al.'s incorrect opinions have played a role in pouring cold water on the new atmosphere and newly emerging sprouts in the current literary work. Therefore, I feel that it is necessary to clarify some of the issues they raised.

    At the beginning of their article, Chen Qitong et al. made a very general statement (and only this one statement) about the main achievements of the current literary work: "The policy of 'Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend' put forward by the Party Central Committee has brought new prosperity and unlimited creativity to the socialist literary and art cause." However, when specifically assessing the current state of literary work, they came to a series of conclusions that are inconsistent with reality and contain pessimistic and doubtful attitudes. Chen Qitong et al. asserted, "In the past year, the literary direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and the creative method of socialist realism have been less and less advocated." "Some writers dare not write about themes that truly reflect the current major political struggles, and few people advocate them anymore. A large number of domestic affairs, love affairs, thrilling stories, etc., have replaced novels, dramas, and poems that depict earth-shaking social changes, earth-shattering liberation struggles, and respectable and imitable heroic figures that are sufficient to educate and inspire the people. Therefore, the combat effectiveness of literature and art has been weakened, the face of the times has become blurred, the voice of the times has become low, and the brilliance of socialist construction has become dim in the mirror of literature and art." "Satirical articles full of dissatisfaction and disappointment have increased." "Since the introduction of 'Let a hundred flowers bloom,' many people have only been keen on rummaging through old boxes, keen on taking shortcuts to adapt old ones, and some individuals have even crowned their names to seek fame and profit after slightly sorting out the valuable heritage left by their ancestors." Please see, this is the picture of the current state of literary work drawn by Chen Qitong et al. "It's terrible!" This is Chen Qitong et al.'s actual overall assessment of the current state of literary work.

    But is the actual situation really that bad? Now let us examine Chen Qitong et al.'s arguments and see how much correctness they have.

    First of all, regarding the issue of "In the past year, the literary direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and the creative method of socialist realism have been less and less advocated."

    After the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" in the first half of last year, literary publications across the country discussed the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" more and reacted more enthusiastically, while talking less about the literary direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and the creative method of socialist realism. This is a fact. But this is also a natural and inevitable phenomenon. Because to implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" in practical work, it is necessary to vigorously promote it in order to break the various concerns of some literary and art workers and scientists, eliminate the various obstacles in the implementation of this policy, and make this policy widely popular and create conditions for the victorious implementation of this policy. It is perfectly normal for various literary publications to give more space to the propaganda and advocacy of this policy, while temporarily talking less about other principled issues in literary work. We have no basis to hastily draw the conclusion that "less and less people are advocating" socialist realism in such a short period of time.

    In fact, discussions on the creative method of socialist realism were still going on in the second half of last year. It can be said that the literary and art circles have made relatively serious and in-depth research on the essence of this creative method, its inheritance, connection, and difference from the previous realism, the specific expression of its advancement, the socialist realism factors in Lu Xun and modern Chinese writers' works, and other issues during this period. Taking only the literary papers commemorating the 20th anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death in literary publications across the country last year, there are many papers that touched on the topic of socialist realism in Mr. Lu Xun's works. Of course, when exploring and researching this creative method last year, some people believed that the creative method of socialist realism might not be correct, and some people put forward the "vague concept" of realism in the socialist era (see "Opinions"), but since advocating a hundred schools of thought contend, the presentation of these different opinions is a very regular natural phenomenon, and there is no need to be alarmed at all. We can use sufficient arguments to criticize these arguments, we can use the objective existence and development of the creative method of socialist realism to prove the shortcomings and errors of these arguments, we can calmly explain our own views, and let the readers understand that the truth is on our side, but we should not put a big hat on these comrades without explaining any reason: "This skepticism and nihilism are the products of petty-bourgeois artistic thought." (See "Opinions") This method of putting on big hats will not help solve the problem. In my opinion, the essay "Realism - A Broad Road" (published in People's Literature, September 1956) by Comrade He Zhi, who believes that the creative method of socialist realism may not be correct, and the essay "On Realism and Its Development in the Socialist Era" (published in Yangtze River Literature, December 1956) by Comrade Zhou Bo, who put forward the "vague concept" of realism in the socialist era, despite the fact that many arguments are worth discussing, it can be seen from the essays that these two comrades have indeed conducted serious research on the creative method of socialist realism. In order to criticize their arguments, it is necessary to conduct comradely scientific debate, and there is no need to prohibit the presentation of questions.

    As for the issue of whether the literary direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers has been less and less advocated in the past year, my views are basically the same as those on the previous issue. We cannot say that the propaganda and advocacy of this literary direction has been done very well in the past. The fact that many literary and art workers believed in or inwardly sympathized with Hu Feng's reactionary literary and art thought before the criticism of Hu Feng's literary and art thought is an example. We also cannot say that the literary direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers has been less and less advocated in the past year. Because this is also not in line with the facts. Not to mention anything else, in the discussion of domestic films in November and December last year, many comrades objectively and fairly pointed out that the achievements in implementing the literary direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers in the past should not be erased, and the literary direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers should not be shaken in the future. It can be seen that there were many comrades who promoted and advocated the literary direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers last year, and not less and less!

    It can be seen from this that Chen Qitong et al.'s argument is one-sided, arbitrary, and inconsistent with the actual situation of literary work and literary criticism work last year.

    Secondly, regarding the issue of "Some writers dare not write about themes that truly reflect the current major political struggles, and few people advocate them anymore."

    This argument is even more unable to withstand the test of our literary work reality. It is true that in recent creations, there are more domestic affairs, love affairs, and thrilling stories than in the past, but we cannot rush to draw negative conclusions from this. Open "People's Literature," "Liberation Army Literature," "Yangtze River Literature," and other local literary publications, and just flipping through the table of contents will show that our writers did write many works reflecting the theme of current major political struggles last year, which reflected "earth-shaking social changes, earth-shattering liberation struggles, and respectable and imitable heroic figures." Taking "People's Literature," which everyone is familiar with, for example, hasn't it published works like "On the Bridge Construction Site," "Internal News of This Newspaper," and "The Person Climbing on the Flagpole" that sharply reflect the theme of current major political struggles and resonate with the voice of the times? Aren't the novels "One Day," "The Everlasting Flame," and "The Story of Grain," etc., which are very popular with readers, describing "earth-shaking social changes, earth-shattering liberation struggles, and respectable and imitable heroic figures"? Taking even "Liberation Army Literature," which Chen Qitong et al. should be very familiar with, the novel "No Storm," which "reflects the theme of current major political struggles," and relatively excellent dramas, features, and poems such as "Yang Gensi," "Raging Flames," and "White Orchid" have been published in several issues last year.

    Next is the issue of "Satirical articles full of dissatisfaction and disappointment have increased."

    Regarding this argument, I believe that it is not only a problem that does not conform to the actual situation (this does not need to be said much), but also contains some negative factors that are sufficient to hinder writers from actively creating in the future. Because "dissatisfaction" can still be said; the author's dissatisfaction with real life may also be to demand a better life than real life. But "disappointment" is simply unimaginable. If you are "disappointed" with our real life, then a serious problem arises: what kind of life does the author "hope" for? Therefore, Chen Qitong et al.'s argument is tantamount to a kind of intimidation to the authors of satirical articles. If this argument is not criticized and it is defaulted to be correct, then it will greatly hurt the confidence and courage of our writers and the vast number of amateur writers. To give an example that I personally came into contact with. A comrade originally planned to write a satirical drama, but after reading Chen Qitong et al.'s article, he did not plan to write it. He said to me: "This script cannot be written. Now it is said that the authors who write satirical articles are 'full of dissatisfaction and disappointment,' what's next? Isn't that foreseeable!" Of course, it is a mistake for this comrade to regard the opinions of individual comrades as the opinions of the Party. But it is certain that Chen Qitong et al.'s argument may indeed have side effects on the thinking of some authors. Isn't it? When the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" began to be publicized, some comrades suspected whether this was a long-term policy of the Party or just a temporary "tactic." Now, doesn't Chen Qitong et al.'s argument just aggravate their original concerns?

    It must be affirmed that in the past year, essays and satirical articles have increased, which is a good phenomenon. This is the active performance of the vast number of writers and amateur writers in responding to the Party's call, and it is a manifestation of the combat effectiveness of literature and art. As Party literary and art workers, we should applaud and welcome it. Among these satirical articles, a few essays and satirical novels have the shortcomings of one-sidedness. The authors do not distinguish between what is essence and phenomenon, do not distinguish between what should be affirmed and what should be protected, and adopt an attitude of negating everything, so that the spearhead of the articles not only pricks the sores in real life, but sometimes also hurts the petals of real life and distorts our real life. We should conduct persuasive and well-intentioned criticism of these works. However, to say in general terms that "satirical articles full of dissatisfaction and disappointment have increased" can only create confusion in people's creative thinking. This may be something that Chen Qitong et al. did not expect, right?

    Next is the issue of "Many people are only keen on rummaging through old boxes, keen on taking shortcuts to adapt old ones."

    We should also make a specific analysis of this issue. Generally speaking, since the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," there have been more people "rummaging through old boxes" and more people "adapting old ones." This shows that the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" has educated everyone to further value national heritage. What's wrong with that? Isn't the Kunqu opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash" also adapted and reorganized? There are also Sichuan operas such as "Tan Ji'er." If more excellent national heritages are reorganized, I don't think there is anything wrong with it. We do not yet have sufficient evidence to prove that the main direction of writers has left the present and turned to the past.

    In summary, the reason why Chen Qitong et al. made these erroneous arguments is that they regard the individual and non-fundamental shortcomings in literary work after the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" was put forward as comprehensive and fundamental shortcomings, and thus believe that the current literary work is simply "very bad" and very worrying. And my opinion is that we should face up to these shortcomings, but we should not exaggerate them, but should analyze them specifically and find the mainstream. I think the mainstream of our current literary work is "very good," or at least not "very bad." In these arguments of Chen Qitong et al., I seem to see the image of the "small-footed woman" that Chairman Mao once pointed out in the article "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization." Last year, our literary work, encouraged and supported by the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," just took a few big steps forward, which aroused Chen Qitong et al.'s "infinite worries." But what does all this have to do with the reality of the rapid progress of our current literary work?

专栏：

    对陈其通等同志的“意见”的意见
    陈辽
    陈其通、陈亚丁、马寒冰、鲁勒四同志合写的文章“我们对目前文艺工作的几点意见”在1月7日人民日报刊出以后，我怀着很大的兴趣反复地读了几遍。我认为其中有不少有价值的意见，对目前的文艺工作是有好处的。例如：应该积极提倡为工农兵服务的文艺方向和社会主义现实主义的创作方法；应该更多更好地创作以现代人民斗争生活为题材的作品。这些意见都是好的。但是在陈其通等同志的“意见”中，同时还包含着一些不正确的意见，这些不正确的意见可以归结为对目前文艺工作、即对去年党中央提出了“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针以后的文艺工作，作了片面的因此是不正确的估计。由于陈其通等同志对目前文艺工作状况的估计基本上是错误的，因此上述某些原则上是正确的意见（这是他们从对目前文艺工作状况的估计的基础上提出来的），也就大大减弱了它们的说服力。不仅如此。陈其通等同志的某些不正确意见，还对目前文艺工作中的新气象和刚刚滋生出来的新芽，起了泼冷水的作用。因此，我觉得对他们所提出来的一些问题有加以澄清的必要。
    陈其通等同志在文章开始对目前文艺工作的主要成就很原则地说了这么一句（也仅仅是这么一句）：“党中央提出的‘百花齐放，百家争鸣’的方针，给社会主义的文学艺术事业带来了新的繁荣和无限的创造性”。但在具体地估计目前文艺工作状况的时候，却得出了一系列的不符合实际的、含有悲观怀疑态度的结论。陈其通等同志断定，“在过去的一年中，为工农兵服务的文艺方向和社会主义现实主义的创作方法，越来越很少有人提倡了。”“真正反映当前重大政治斗争的主题有些作家不敢写了，也很少有人再提倡了，大量的家务事、儿女情、惊险故事等等，代替了描写翻天复地的社会变革、惊天动地的解放斗争、令人尊敬和效法的英雄人物的足以教育人民和鼓舞人心的小说、戏剧、诗歌，因此，使文学艺术的战斗性减弱了，时代的面貌模糊了，时代的声音低沉了，社会主义建设的光辉在文学艺术这面镜子里光彩暗淡了。”“充满着不满和失望的讽刺文章多起来了”。“自从提出‘百花齐放’以后，有许多人只热衷于翻老箱底，热衷于走捷径去改编旧的，甚至有个别人把老祖宗留下的宝贵遗产稍加整理就冠上自己的名字去图名求利。”请看，这就是陈其通等同志对目前文艺工作的状况描画出来的一幅图画。“糟得很！”这就是陈其通等同志对目前文艺工作状况的实际的总估计。
    但是实际情况究竟是不是这样糟呢？现在让我们检查一下陈其通等同志的论断，看看究竟有多少正确性。
    首先是关于“在过去的一年中，为工农兵服务的文艺方向和社会主义现实主义的创作方法，越来越很少有人提倡了”的问题。
    去年上半年，党中央提出了“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针以后，全国各地文艺报刊关于“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，讨论得多一些，反映热烈一些，而对为工农兵服务的文艺方向和社会主义现实主义的创作方法谈得少一些，这是事实。但这也是一种自然的、必然的现象。因为要在实际工作中贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，就必须大张旗鼓地进行宣传，以打破一部分文艺家、科学家的各种各样的顾虑，扫除实施这一方针时的各种各样的阻力，使这一方针广泛地深入人心，为胜利贯彻这一方针创造条件。各个文艺报刊对这一方针的宣传、提倡给以较多的篇幅，而对文艺工作上其它原则性问题，暂时谈得少一些，这是十分正常的。我们没有根据在这样短的时间中就匆忙地作出“越来越很少有人提倡”社会主义现实主义的结论。
    事实上，关于社会主义现实主义创作方法的讨论，去年下半年还是进行着的。可以说，文艺界对于这一创作方法的实质，它和以往的现实主义的继承、联系和区别，它的先进性的具体表现，鲁迅和我国现代作家作品中的社会主义现实主义因素等等问题，在这一时期作了比较认真的深入的研究。单拿去年全国各地文艺报刊纪念鲁迅先生逝世二十周年中的文艺论文来说，即有不少篇论文是接触到鲁迅先生作品中的社会主义现实主义这一论题的。当然，在去年探讨和研究这一创作方法的时候，有人认为社会主义现实主义创作方法未必正确，有人提出了社会主义时代的现实主义的“模糊概念”（见“意见”），但是既然提倡百家争鸣，这些不同意见的提出，就是非常合乎规律的自然现象，根本用不着大惊小怪。我们可以用充分的论据来批判这些论点，我们可以拿社会主义现实主义这一创作方法的客观存在和发展来证明这些论点的缺点和错误，我们可以平心静气地说明我们自己的看法，让读者明白真理是在我们这一边，但是我们却不应当不说明任何理由，就给这些同志扣上这样一顶大帽子：“这种怀疑论和取消论是小资产阶级艺术思想的产物。”（见“意见”）这种扣大帽子的方法，决不能有助于问题的解决。据我看来，认为社会主义现实主义创作方法未必正确的何直同志的论文“现实主义——广阔的道路”（载人民文学1956年9月号）和提出社会主义时代的现实主义这一“模糊概念”的周勃同志的论文“论现实主义及其在社会主义时代的发展”（载长江文艺1956年12月号），尽管有不少论点是值得商榷的，但是从论文中看出，这两位同志确实对社会主义现实主义的创作方法问题作过认真的研究。为了批评他们的论点，就需要进行同志式的科学的论辩，而不需要禁止提出问题。
    至于为工农兵服务的文艺方向，过去一年来是否越来越少有人提倡了的问题，我的看法基本上和对前一问题的看法是一样的。我们不能说过去对这一文艺方向的宣传和提倡就做得很好。在批判胡风文艺思想以前，有不少文艺工作者信仰或者内心同情胡风的反动文艺思想就是一个例子。我们也不能说过去一年来对于为工农兵服务的文艺方向已经越来越少有人提倡了。因为这也并不符合事实。不说别的，就在去年11、12月间讨论国产电影片的问题的时候，就有不少同志客观而公正地指出：过去执行为工农兵服务的文艺方向的成绩不容抹煞，今后为工农兵服务的文艺方向也不容动摇。可见，宣传和提倡为工农兵服务的文艺方向的同志去年也大有人在，而并不是越来越少！
    由此可见，陈其通等同志这一论断是片面的、武断的，与去年文艺工作和文艺评论工作的实际情况不符。
    其次是关于“真正反映当前重大政治斗争的主题有些作家不敢写了，也很少有人再提倡了”的问题。
    这一论断更经不起我们的文艺工作现实的检验。不错，在最近时期的创作题材中，家务事、儿女情、惊险故事是比过去多了，但是还不能由此就匆忙地得出反面的结论。打开“人民文学”、“解放军文艺”、“长江文艺”以及其它各地文艺刊物来看，只要翻一翻目录，也就可以知道，去年我们的作家还是写了不少反映当前重大政治斗争的作品，它们反映了“翻天复地的社会变革、惊天动地的解放斗争、令人尊敬和效法的英雄人物”。拿大家熟悉的“人民文学”来说，过去一年不是曾经发表过像“在桥梁工地上”“本报内部消息”“爬在旗杆上的人”这样尖锐地反映当前重大政治斗争的主题的震响着时代声音的作品吗？“总有一天”“永不熄灭的火焰”“粮食的故事”等等大受读者欢迎的小说，难道不是描写“翻天复地的社会变革、惊天动地的解放斗争、令人尊敬和效法的英雄人物”吗？即以陈其通等同志应该非常熟悉的“解放军文艺”来说，在去年几期刊物里，就曾登出了“反映当前重大政治斗争的主题”的小说“无风浪”，以及像“杨根思”“熊熊的火焰”“白兰花”等等比较优秀的戏剧、特写和诗歌。
    又次是关于“充满着不满和失望的讽刺文章多起来了”的问题。
    对于这一论断，我认为不仅是不符合实际情况的问题（这是用不着多说的），而且还包含着足以妨碍作家今后积极创作的一些消极因素在内。因为，“不满”犹可说；作者对现实生活不满，也可能是为了要求比现实生活更美好的生活。但“失望”却简直是难以想像了。对我们的现实生活“失望”，那么，严重的问题就来了：作者到底“希望”什么样的生活呢？因此，陈其通等同志这一论断，无异是对讽刺文作者的一种恐吓。这一论断如果不予批判，默认它是正确的话，那么，它将大大伤害我们的作家和广大业余写作者的信心和勇气。举一个我亲自接触到的例子来说。有一位同志，他原打算写一个讽刺剧，但在他看了陈其通等同志的文章以后，他不打算写了。他对我说：“这个剧本不能写了。现在是说写讽刺文的作者，‘充满着不满和失望’，下一步呢？那还不是可以想见的吗！”当然这位同志把个别同志的意见当作党的意见，是一种错误。但陈其通等同志的这一论断确实有可能在一些作者思想上产生副作用，这也是可以肯定的。不是吗？还在“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针开始宣传的时候，就有某些同志怀疑这究竟是不是党的长时期的方针，会不会只是某种暂时性的“策略”。现在陈其通等同志的这一论断，不正好加重了他们原有的顾虑了吗？
    必须肯定，去年一年来，小品文、讽刺文增多了，这是一种好现象。这是广大作家和业余写作者响应党的号召的积极表现，是文学艺术战斗性的表现，作为党的文艺工作者，我们应当鼓掌欢迎。在这些讽刺文章中，也有少数的小品文和讽刺小说有片面性的缺点，作者分不清什么是本质和现象，分不清什么是应该肯定的，什么是应该保护的，采取了否定一切的态度，以致文章的矛头不仅刺痛了现实生活中的疮疤，有时还伤害了现实生活的花瓣，歪曲了我们的现实生活。对于这些作品，我们应该进行有说服力量的、与人为善的批评。但是笼统地说“充满着不满和失望的讽刺文章多起来了”，却只能造成人们创作思想上的混乱。这也许是陈其通等同志所料想不到的吧？
    又次是关于“有许多人只热衷于翻老箱底，热衷于走捷径去改编旧的”的问题。
    对于这一问题，我们也应当加以具体分析。一般说来，自从党中央提出了“百花齐放，百家争鸣”以后，“翻老箱底”的人是多了一些，“改编旧的”的人是多了一些。这说明了党的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，教育了大家进一步地重视民族遗产。这又有什么不好呢？昆剧“十五贯”不也是改编整理出来的吗？还有像川剧“谭记儿”等。如果整理出更多一些优秀的民族遗产出来，我想是没有什么不好的。我们现在还没有足够的证据证明作家的主要方向已经离开了现在而转到过去。
    总起来说，陈其通等同志之所以作出这些错误论断，是在于他们把“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针提出以后的文艺工作中的个别的、不是根本性的缺点，当作全面的、根本性的缺点，于是也就认为目前的文艺工作简直是“糟得很”了，是很堪忧虑的了。而我的意见是，应该正视这些缺点，但不应当加以夸大，而是要加以具体分析，找出主流。我认为，我们目前文艺工作的主流是“好得很”的，至少不是“糟得很”。在陈其通等同志的这些论断里，我似乎又看到了毛主席曾经在“关于农业合作化问题”一文中指出过的“小脚女人”的形象。去年，我们的文艺工作在党的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针的鼓舞和支持下，刚刚向前迈了几大步，就引起陈其通等同志的“无穷的忧虑”来了。可是这一切和我们目前的文艺工作的迅速前进的现实情况又有什么相干呢？
