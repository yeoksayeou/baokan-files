Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 27th: The Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions recently held a provincial trade union mass production work conference. On the basis of affirming the achievements of the advanced producer movement last year, it decided to further strengthen political and ideological work in the advanced producer movement, and mobilize and organize the enthusiasm of workers to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy.

Last year, factories, mines and enterprises in Jiangxi Province carried out advanced producer movements in accordance with their own characteristics, and the scale and depth of the movement were more extensive and in-depth than previous labor competitions. A large number of advanced producers and workers emerged throughout the province. However, there were also shortcomings in the advanced producer movement carried out last year, mainly that the ideological education work in the movement was weak, which led to the consolidation of labor discipline. There were shortcomings such as unconsolidated labor discipline, the pursuit of quantity, neglect of product quality, increased accidents in production, and large wastes. In view of this situation, the conference requested that in carrying out this year's advanced producer movement, strengthening political and ideological education work must be placed in the primary position. At the same time, in combination with the characteristics of each enterprise, workers should be educated to strive to improve product quality, vigorously save raw materials, and reduce and eliminate accidents.

In order to ensure the in-depth and lasting development of the movement to increase production and practice economy, the conference also proposed that it is necessary to improve the style of leadership, implement the mass line, and better play the enthusiasm of the workers.

    江西工会联合会决定
    对职工加强政治思想教育
    据新华社南昌27日电  江西省工会联合会最近召开的全省工会群众生产工作会议，在肯定去年先进生产者运动成就的基础上，决定进一步加强先进生产者运动中的政治思想工作，调动和组织职工群众的积极性开展增产节约运动。
    去年，江西省各厂矿企业单位按照自己的特点开展了先进生产者运动，运动规模和深度比历年的劳动竞赛更广泛、深入。全省涌现出大批先进生产者和工作者。但是，在去年开展先进生产者运动中也存在着缺点，主要是运动中思想教育工作薄弱，以致劳动纪律不巩固，出现了追求数量，忽视产品质量，以及生产中事故增多，浪费大等缺点。根据这种情况，会议要求在开展今年的先进生产者运动当中，必须把加强政治思想教育工作放在首要位置。同时要结合各企业特点，教育职工努力改进产品质量，大力节约原材料，减少和消灭事故。
    为保证增产节约运动深入持久的开展，会议还提出必须改进领导作风，贯彻群众路线，更好地发挥职工群众的积极性。
