　　Do a Good Job in the Supply of Small Farm Tools
　　Bai Shui
　　This year, many supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have learned from the lesson of the shortage of small farm tools during the spring plowing season last year, and have prepared small farm tools early, and increased the variety and quantity of small farm tools. Some supply and marketing cooperatives in Guangxi, Jilin, Sichuan, Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Anhui and other provinces have prepared small farm tools that have reached 60%-70% of the planned supply during the spring plowing season; some places have even exceeded the original supply plan.
　　However, at present, some cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives do not pay enough attention to the supply of small farm tools. Some cadres believe that small farm tools are almost ready and there is no need to continue to organize the source of goods; some cadres believe that farmers need fewer small farm tools this year than last year, and supply and marketing cooperatives do not need to prepare many small farm tools.
　　What is the actual situation? Are the small farm tools prepared in various places enough? Far from it.
　　Up to now, the total value of small farm tools prepared by supply and marketing cooperatives in various places (including last year's inventory) is about 140 million yuan, which only accounts for half of the total value of small farm tools supplied by the supply and marketing cooperative system last year, and some of them are of poor quality and damaged. The Miaotou District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Quanxian County has an inventory of more than 4,000 pairs of manure baskets and bamboo baskets, and 28% of them have been infested with insects; a farmer went to the Shaoshui District Supply and Marketing Cooperative to buy manure baskets, and could not find a satisfactory pair out of 1,400 pairs of manure baskets. The nine agricultural cooperatives in Zhenjie District of Zhendu County lack more than 1,300 pieces of grass rakes, hoes, etc., while the local supply and marketing cooperative only has about 200 pieces in stock. The supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Hunan Province have an inventory of about 4 million pieces of small farm tools, of which only 60% are suitable for spring plowing by farmers, and the quality is not good.
　　Will the small farm tools needed by farmers this year be reduced? No. From the materials of some typical investigations, it can be seen that the small farm tools needed by farmers this year have increased to varying degrees compared with the past; farmers in mountainous areas, ethnic minority areas, and areas where many small farm tools were damaged due to disasters last year need to purchase small farm tools even more. 186 members of Shaoyang, Yuanjiang and other counties in Hunan need to purchase small farm tools this year, with an average increase of about 17% compared with last year. According to a survey of 11 typical households in the first senior agricultural cooperative in Fangcheng Township, Wu District, Zhanyi County, Yunnan Province, 68 pieces of iron and wood small farm tools are planned to be purchased this year, an increase of 27% over last year, with an average of six pieces per household. The first agricultural cooperative of Lvcun Construction in Anyang County, Henan Province, has 1,106 male and female laborers, and needs to add more than 1,200 pieces of small farm tools such as manure baskets, iron shovels, rake hooks, and iron rakes this year, with an average of more than one piece for each laborer. The demand for small farm tools in some remote mountainous areas and ethnic minority areas has increased by more than 30% compared with last year. Many areas urgently need to add lightweight small farm tools for women, children and the elderly.
　　In order to do a good job in the supply of small farm tools, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places must cooperate closely with handicraft cooperatives, assist handicraft cooperatives in solving some difficulties in the production of small farm tools, vigorously manufacture small farm tools according to the needs of local farmers, and repair old farm tools in a timely manner. At the same time, handicraft production cooperatives must also effectively improve the specifications and quality of small farm tools.
　　In the organization of the production and supply of small farm tools, various places should fully explore the potential of local waste steel and iron, organize rural peddlers to go to villages to purchase waste steel and iron, and overcome the current difficulties of insufficient raw materials. At the same time, it is necessary to advocate that farmers exchange old farm tools and scrap iron for small farm tools. Recently, various parts of Guangxi Province have utilized more than 40,000 dan of existing scrap iron through inventory checks, which has played a great role in alleviating the current tight supply of raw materials for small farm tools.

### 做好小农具的供应工作

　　做好小农具的供应工作
　　白水
    今年，许多地区的供销社，都接受了去年春耕时间小农具脱销的教训，提早准备了小农具，并增加了小农具的品种和数量。广西、吉林、四川、河北、山西、河南、安徽等省一些供销社准备好的小农具，已达到春耕时期计划供应数的60％—70％；有的地方还超过了原订供应计划。
    但是，目前也有一部分供销社的干部，对供应小农具不够重视。有些干部认为小农具已准备得差不多了，不需要再去继续组织货源；有些干部认为农民今年需要的小农具比去年少，供销社不需要准备很多小农具。
    实际情况怎样呢？各地已经准备的小农具是不是够用了？还差得很远。
    到现在为止，各地供销社已准备的小农具（连同去年库存的），总值约达一亿四千万元，仅仅占去年供销社系统供应小农具的总值的一半，而且其中有一部分是质量不好和损坏了的。广西全县庙头区供销社，库存粪箕、箩筐四千多对，已经生虫的达28％；一个农民到绍水区供销社买粪箕，在一千四百对粪箕中竟挑不出一对合意的。镇都县镇结区九个农业社，共缺草耙、锄头等一千三百多件，而当地供销社的库存仅有二百件左右。湖南省各地供销社库存的小农具大约有四百万件，适合农民春耕使用的仅占60％，品质也不好。
    今年农民需要的小农具是不是减少了呢？不是的。从一些典型调查的材料中可以看出，农民今年需要的小农具比过去都有不同程度的增加；山区、少数民族地区及去年因受灾而毁坏了很多小农具的地区的农民，更需要购买小农具。湖南邵阳、沅江等县一百八十六户社员，今年需要购买的小农具平均比去年增长17％左右。据云南省沾益县五区方城乡第一高级农业社十一个典型户的调查，今年计划购买铁、木小农具六十八件，比去年增加27％，平均每户需添置六件。河南安阳县吕村建设第一农业社，现有男女劳动力一千一百零六个，今年就需添置粪筐、铁锨、扒钩、铁耙子等小农具一千二百多件，平均每个劳动力需添置一件多。有些偏僻山区和少数民族地区，对小农具的需要量比去年增加30％以上。很多地区急需增添妇女、儿童和老人使用的轻便小农具。
    为了做好小农具的供应工作，各地供销社必须和手工业合作社密切配合，协助手工业社解决小农具生产中的一些困难，根据当地农民的需要，大力制造小农具，并及时修补旧农具。同时手工业生产社还要切实改进小农具的规格、质量。
    在组织小农具生产、供应工作中，各地应充分发掘地方废钢废铁的潜力，组织农村小商贩串乡收购废钢铁，克服当前原料不足的困难。同时要提倡农民拿破旧的农具、废铁换小农具。最近广西省各地，通过检查库存，把现存的四万多担废铁利用起来，对缓和当前小农具原料供应紧张起了很大作用。
