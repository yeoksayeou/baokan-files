Combining Pen Manufacturing with Increased Production and Thrift:
　　Joint Speech by Wu Gengmei and Tang Diyi
    We would like to offer some suggestions regarding the movement for increased production and thrift.

    First, two points of understanding: (1) The movement for increased production and thrift is not a "gust of wind." The achievements of past movements for increased production and thrift are undeniable, but there have also been shortcomings. A rush to increase production, a rush to save, and then it's over when the wind blows – this is a major defect. Vice Premier Chen Yun's call for the entire nation and the government to engage in the movement for increased production and thrift will not only swiftly and smoothly overcome the difficulties of 1957, but will also perfectly complete China's first Five-Year Plan. This is of particularly important significance. We believe that this is by no means just this year's work, but rather a long-term task in the process of socialist construction. (2) The movement for increased production and thrift is not segmented or isolated. Vice Premier Chen Yun said in his report that it is necessary to prevent abnormal methods such as only caring about quantity and not quality, only caring about production and not safety, or relaxing equipment maintenance, wasting resources, and neglecting balanced production. This is completely correct. In the past, increase production and thrift have been separated and isolated, with some only caring about increasing production and not thrift, not caring about sales, resulting in wasted raw materials due to increased production or backlog in the market. There has also been a great deal of waste due to one-sided thrift that disregards quality or reduces the production of many varieties. We must resolutely oppose this. We express our complete support for the several directions of effort for all industrial enterprises in the movement for increased production and thrift proposed by Vice Premier Chen Yun in his report, which can solve the key problems in industrial production.

    Below are a few additional suggestions for the reference of relevant government departments.

　　I. Increased production should focus on increasing the production of raw materials; increasing the production of products with high use value; increasing the production of products needed for objective development; and increasing the production of high-grade and refined products.

      (1) While saving raw materials, attention should be paid to increasing the production of raw materials (especially those that need to be imported). Raw materials that can be self-made should be increased accordingly, and those that cannot be self-made should be actively trial-produced. This can not only save foreign exchange, but also ensure normal supply. We hope that relevant government departments will give full encouragement and support to the increased production of raw materials in all aspects. For example, the celluloid flower penholder raw materials and iridium particles on pen nibs used in Shanghai's pen manufacturing industry have always been imported. Later, small-scale production was successfully trial-produced. Now, under the conditions of meeting the needs of the industry and ensuring safe production, investment is being gradually made for reconstruction or expansion (but the process from application to approval is quite difficult). Now, just calculating the cost of celluloid penholders alone can show its effect. An increase of just over 70,000 yuan in investment can increase production from 1 1/2 tons to 4 1/2 tons, which can supply the needs of 2.4 million gold pens, and can save 500,000 US dollars in foreign exchange. Calculating from the perspective of gold pen factories, imported goods are allocated at 12 yuan a dozen, while self-made ones are 8 yuan a dozen, and 2.4 million pens can reduce costs by 800,000 yuan. And the celluloid penholder factory can recover its investment with one quarter's profit. After establishing a factory for self-production, the quantity, quality, and delivery date of supply have also been guaranteed. (2) Increase the production of products with high use value. For example, the production of fountain pens (including gold pens, iridium-tipped pens, and steel pens) and pencils, we have heard that the central government is considering the increased production figures for the second Five-Year Plan. Compared with this year, fountain pens are planned to increase by about 50%, and pencils are planned to increase by about 100%. We believe that increased production is needed, but the focus should not be solely on increasing the general quantity, but rather on paying more attention to improving quality and increasing the production of products with high use value. Therefore, as far as the pen manufacturing industry is concerned, improving the use value of pen nibs and pencil leads for fountain pens and pencils is the greatest increase in production and thrift. We believe that the production of steel pens among fountain pens should be eliminated and completely replaced by iridium-tipped pens. Because the raw materials for the two types of pens are basically the same, iridium-tipped pens only have one more iridium particle on the stainless steel nib than steel pens, with a cost difference of less than one dime, but the use value is doubled (iridium-tipped pens can be used for one to two years, while steel pens can only be used for half a year to a year). Increasing the production of one iridium-tipped pen is equivalent to increasing the production of two steel pens, and can also save the raw materials for one steel pen. However, this opinion has not yet been fully agreed upon with the commercial departments in Shanghai. (3) Increase production with foresight and increase the production of products needed for objective development. Increased production cannot simply rely on historical data to mechanically increase proportionally, but must be based on the needs of the people for a long time to come. In recent years, the United States and Japan have been continuously improving the production of "ballpoint pens," with good quality, clever styles, convenient use, no need to add ink, and no leakage, and the cost is cheaper than fountain pens, which are very popular among consumers. At present, there is only one Fenghua Ballpoint Pen (i.e., ballpoint pen) factory in China, which was merged during the large-scale joint venture. Due to the small amount of funds, simple factory buildings and equipment, and weak technical strength during private ownership, the quality and style of the products need to be improved, but the supply is still less than the demand, and can only meet 20% of the market needs. If the quality of ballpoint pens is improved, production is increased, and the variety of colors and styles are expanded, the cost will be cheaper, and fountain pens and pencils will inevitably be greatly reduced to varying degrees in the future. The Shanghai Professional Company recently discussed the second Five-Year Plan and proposed in the draft to increase the production of ballpoint pens by 4.6 times, and is currently strengthening research to improve quality. Trial production of high-grade fine ballpoint pens will require considerable infrastructure investment for building factory buildings and adding equipment. We hope that the central and local relevant departments will pay attention to this ballpoint pen industry with great development prospects and give it strong support. (4) Increase the production of high-grade and refined products. According to the different purchasing power and preferences of the people, we also need to increase a certain number of high-grade and refined products of various varieties. The two aspects of quality, namely, the use value and the style and decoration, must be improved. For example, fountain pens and pencils that are close to the international level have not yet been produced. We are preparing to strive to make gold pens close to the level of "Parker" and pencils close to the level of "Venus." Because of the limitations of raw materials, equipment, technology, and other conditions, this kind of product can only be trial-produced in small quantities first, with separate brands and separate prices. If you want to improve all of a certain original product to a level close to the international level all at once, it is divorced from reality. Part of the raw materials for high-grade products need to be imported when necessary, and the government should be asked to consider approving them. For example, "Venus" pencils are still imported. If we can import high-grade wood to make high-grade pencils to replace the same quantity of "Venus" pencils, we can save more than ten times the foreign exchange, and high-grade products can also be exported.

　　II. In terms of thrift, change product specifications to save materials; save packaging based on sales targets; make full use of existing equipment; and widely carry out the collection of waste materials.

    (1) On the principle of ensuring that the use value is not reduced, it is advocated to change specifications to save raw materials. For example, the diameter of ordinary pencil rods is 7.65 mm, and the diameter of thin pencil rods is 5.90 mm. The use value of the pencil leads is the same, especially for elementary school students who will not feel that they are too thin, so it is recommended to use more thin pencil rods. Thin rods can save more than 5% of wood and more than 60% of paint compared with ordinary rods, and the saved raw materials can be used to increase production. At the same time, the cost reduction can reduce the burden on consumers. (2) Save decoration and packaging materials according to different sales targets. Decoration and packaging must be emphasized for export commodities, otherwise it will be unfavorable for promotion in the international market. Decoration and packaging can be saved for domestic sales commodities, especially those sold locally, which can be simplified, but it is also necessary to prevent oversimplification from affecting the use value. For example, I heard that due to the tight supply of paper, rubber shoes at one time had neither boxes nor paper wraps, and they were soiled and discolored in the store, which was a one-sided saving. (3) Rationally use infrastructure investment. Increased production should make full use of existing equipment and use manual or semi-manual operation. It is not necessary to completely pursue mechanization and automation. If the original equipment is really not enough, a two-shift or three-shift system can also be considered, which can expand employment and reduce investment. However, for investments that can improve quality, increase variety, save raw materials, and strive for exports, as well as expenses for purchasing instruments and books, it is hoped that they can be reduced as little as possible. (4) Widely carry out the collection of waste materials. At present, many people still do not know the great significance of waste materials that can be recycled and reused, and the collection of waste materials needs to be improved. For example, old newspapers, glass bottles, toothpaste tubes, old rubber shoes, old aluminum pots, old plastics, fountain pen nibs, etc. can all be recycled and reused, and the general public does not fully know the shortage of these raw materials, and publicity must be strengthened. On the other hand, there are too few waste product companies, the procedures are too complicated, and the pricing is too low, so that some people are unwilling to go. There is also improper handling and non-detailed classification, resulting in the use of good materials for inferior purposes. Shanghai also canceled the collection of waste materials by small vendors at one time. All these situations must be improved. Some people suggest that department stores collect waste products and exchange old for new at the marked price, which we think can be considered.

　　III. In terms of planning, oppose false reporting and rough estimates; prevent blind ordering; overcome departmentalism; and avoid plans that are too rigid.

    (1) Oppose false reporting and rough estimates and plans that add three feet for good measure. Some units that need raw materials deliberately underreport their inventory and roughly overestimate the amount they need, preparing to get the actual amount needed when the higher authorities reduce it. Even layers upon layers of additions and level-by-level false reporting, so that the central government is completely divorced from reality. If the central government approves it as it is, it will be caught off guard, seriously affecting the overall national plan supply and causing waste. For example, Shanghai's paper industry roughly estimated its cement needs at 4,000 tons this year. In the first quarter, the central government allocated 1,800 tons as requested, which was very tight. At the same time, because cement was not discounted and other materials such as steel bars, bricks, and tiles were discounted, it was impossible to carry out infrastructure construction, resulting in a backlog of funds. If it is left for a long time and deteriorates, it will cause waste. Shanghai's paper industry's false reporting and rough estimates when cement is tight must be opposed. At the same time, they also hope that when the higher authorities review the plan, they must supply all the materials for a certain infrastructure project that has been approved. (2) Prevent blind ordering plans. It is heard that at the supply and marketing balance meeting, the representatives from various regions are not necessarily clear about what kind of goods are suitable for what kind of sales channels. If you want it, I want it too, especially when it comes to snatching famous brands. For example, the 26th Golden Star gold pen has been the same old style for more than 20 years, but everyone is still snatching it. The industrial sector cannot meet the demand, but are consumers satisfied? Many people ask us why this clumsy appearance has not been changed for so long? If the commercial sector blindly orders goods and the industrial sector does as ordered, it will affect improvement. At the same time, it will also cause out-of-stock in some places and backlogs in other places. (3) Overcome departmentalism. Chairman Mao instructed that the investment ratio of heavy and light industry should be considered to be reduced to six to one in the second Five-Year Plan, which is correct in order to meet the needs of the people and be more conducive to industrialization, but this does not mean that all light industries in various regions should increase investment equally. For example, the utilization rate of cigarette equipment is only 35.5%, and there is still a backlog of matches, so there is no need to invest and increase production. At the same time, various regions should also overcome departmentalism. For example, the percentage of Shanghai's pencil production in the national production has gradually decreased from about 80% after liberation to 48% this year (due to the increase in factories and production in the interior). During the second Five-Year Plan period, according to the central plan and Shanghai's production capacity, the percentage will continue to decrease. We believe that it is not necessary to maintain the original 48% ratio. It is only necessary to appropriately increase production under the full utilization of existing equipment. There is no need to invest in building new factories to increase production, because the main raw material, wood, comes from the Northeast. It is currently difficult to find suitable wood near Shanghai. New factories should consider locating near raw material producing areas. (4) Some plans should not be too rigid or mechanical. For example, light industrial products, such as fountain pens, only need to set the total output, output value, profit to be turned over, and savings targets. As for the percentage of gold pens, iridium-tipped pens, and steel pens, there is no need to set it too rigidly. It can be formulated by the local industrial and commercial departments based on the specific circumstances of market demand and raw material supply, in order to avoid production shutdowns, material shortages, rushing tasks, or sales backlogs, all of which will cause waste.

　　IV. Price issues should adjust prices on the principle of not affecting profit delivery; and should maintain industrial production while reducing commodity profits.

    (1) Can we consider adjusting prices on the principle of not affecting profit delivery? The commercial sector's unchanged selling price will also cause waste. For example, why hasn't the commercial sector agreed to produce more iridium-tipped pens and gradually eliminate steel pens, as mentioned earlier, since iridium-tipped pens have twice the use value of steel pens? According to the commercial sector, it is because steel pens sell well and iridium-tipped pens have a backlog. Our view is that the main reason is that the price is not reasonably set and the publicity work is too poor. Because the retail price of an iridium-tipped pen is about 1.60 yuan, while a steel pen is only about 0.90 yuan, a difference of 0.70 yuan per pen. Before people know that its use value is twice as high, they will buy the cheaper steel pen. Another example can illustrate that the pricing is too unreasonable. If there is a shrewd consumer, he can spend nine jiao to buy a steel pen, and then spend two jiao to replace it with an iridium-tipped pen nib after the steel pen nib is broken. He can spend a total of 1.10 yuan to obtain the use value of a steel pen and an iridium-tipped pen, while buying an iridium-tipped pen alone costs about 1.60 yuan. Why is the pricing so unreasonable? This is because steel pen factories blindly developed in the past. In order to implement the policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation, the price of steel pens is very low. Some factories will lose money, and the commercial sector's profit is also very low, and some pens will also lose money. Why is the price of iridium-tipped pens high? This is because iridium-tipped pens had a small output and high costs and pricing when they were new products. Although the price has gradually decreased due to increased output and reduced costs, the profit is still higher. Therefore, we believe that it is necessary to appropriately increase the price of steel pens and lower the price of iridium-tipped pens on the principle of not affecting profit delivery, and to do a good job in publicity. This can not only take into account increased production and thrift, but also ensure that neither the industrial nor commercial sectors lose money, and also benefit consumers, which is a win-win situation. (2) Industrial production should be maintained while reducing commercial profits. According to the Shanghai Chemical Raw Materials Industry: the cost of sodium fluoride anticorrosive agent for railways, using new technology with improved technology is now only 1,420 yuan per ton, while the cost in the past was high at 2,000 yuan per ton. Therefore, the listed price is set at 2,300 yuan per ton, and the commercial profit is too high. Recently, because Shenyang's products are directly allocated, they can be priced at 1,700 yuan per ton. The railway department hopes to lower the listed price and still buy Shanghai goods, but the Shanghai Chemical Supply Station disagrees because the listed price is frozen, and Shanghai will have to stop production. We believe that commercial profits should be reduced to maintain Shanghai's production.

    The above opinions are mostly based on the work of the Shanghai Pen Manufacturing Industry Company and are proposed from the perspective of our own business. They are both immature and incomplete. We hope that they will be used as a reference for relevant parties and receive corrections. (Attached picture)

    结合制笔工业谈增产节约工作
　　吴羹梅、汤蒂因的联合发言
    我们想就关于增产节约运动方面提供些意见。
    先谈两点体会：（1）增产节约运动不是“一阵风”。过去的增产节约运动成绩是肯定的，但也有缺点。一窝风的增产，一窝风的节约，一阵风吹过就算了，这是很大的缺点。陈云副总理号召全国人民和政府一起进行增产节约运动，这不仅将迅速地顺利地克服1957年的困难，而且将完满地完成我国第一个五年计划，这是具有特别重要意义的。我们认为这决不单是今年的工作，而是社会主义建设过程中长期的工作。（2）增产节约运动不是分割孤立的。陈云副总理在报告中说到必须防止只顾数量、不顾质量，只顾生产、不顾安全，或者放松设备检修，浪费资源，忽视均衡生产等等不正常的办法，这是完全正确的。过去把增产和节约分割孤立起来，也有只顾增产，不顾节约，不顾销售，于是产生因增产而浪费原材料或造成市场上的积压，还产生因片面节约而不顾质量或减产了许多品种从而造成很大的浪费，我们都必须坚决反对。陈云副总理在报告中所提出的一切工业企业在增产节约运动中的几个努力方向，可以解决工业生产中的关键问题，我们表示完全拥护。
    下面提出几点补充意见，以供政府有关部门参考。
　　一、增产方面增加原材料的生产；增产使用价值高的产品；增加客观发展需要的产品；增加高级精致的产品。
      （1）节约原材料的同时要注意增加原材料（特别是要靠进口的）的生产。原材料中能自制的要相应增产，不能自制的要积极试制，这不仅可以节约外汇，还可以保证正常供应，希望政府有关部门对原材料的增产在各方面给以充分的鼓励和支持。例如上海制笔工业的赛璐珞花笔杆原料和笔尖上的铱粒，一向进口，后来试制成功小量生产，现在正在为满足本业需要和保证安全生产的条件下逐步投资进行改建或扩建（可是从申请到批准是经过相当困难过程的）。现在只算一笔赛璐珞笔杆的帐就可以知道它的效果。只增加七万多元投资就可以把产量从11／2吨提高到41／2吨，可以供应240万支金笔需要，并可节约外汇美金50万。就金笔厂来计算，进口货调拨价12元一打，自己制造8元一打，240万支就可以降低成本80万元，而赛璐珞笔杆厂在一个季度的利润就可以把投资收回来。设厂自制后对于供应的数量、质量、日期也有了保证。（2）增产使用价值高的产品。例如自来水笔（包含金笔、铱金笔、钢笔三种）和铅笔的生产，我们听到中央正在考虑第二个五年计划的增产数字，与今年相比，自来水笔打算增加50％左右，铅笔增加100％左右。我们认为增产是需要的，但重点是不能专着重于一般数量的增加，而是更需要注意提高质量，增加使用价值高的产品。所以就制笔工业论，自来水笔和铅笔应当提高笔尖和铅芯的使用价值，才是最大的增产节约。我们认为自来水笔中的钢笔生产应当取消，完全由铱金笔来代替。因为两种笔原料基本相同，铱金笔只比钢笔在不锈钢的笔尖上多一个铱粒，成本相差不到一角，而使用价值却增加一倍（铱金笔可用一年至二年，钢笔只可用半年到一年）。增产一支铱金笔等于增产钢笔两支，还可节约一支钢笔的原材料。但是这个意见目前在上海还未能与商业部门的意见完全取得一致。（3）增产要瞻前顾后，增加客观发展需要的产品。增产不能单凭历史资料机械地比例增加，而是要针对今后长时期内人民的需要来增产。近年来美国、日本对于“原子笔”的生产不断改进，质量好、式样灵巧、使用方便，不必加墨水也不会漏水，成本又比自来水笔便宜，很受消费者欢迎。目前国内只有上海一家丰华圆珠笔（即原子笔）厂，是在大合营时合并起来的。由于私营时资金少，厂房设备简陋，技术力量薄弱，产品的质量式样均待改进，但是供不应求，只能满足市场需要的20％。如果提高圆珠笔的质量，增加产量，扩大花色品种，成本将更便宜，将来自来水笔和铅笔必然会在不同程度上大大减少。上海的专业公司最近讨论第二个五年计划，在草案中提出增产圆珠笔4.6倍，目前正在加强研究改进质量。试制高级的细圆珠笔，要有相当的基建投资用于建厂房添置设备，希望中央与地方有关部门重视这一大有发展前途的圆珠笔工业，并予以有力的支持。（4）增加高级精致的产品。根据人民的购买力和爱好的不同，我们还需要增加各种品种的一定数量的高级精致产品，质量的两个方面就是使用价值和式样装璜都要提高。例如目前接近国际水平的自来水笔和铅笔都未生产，我们准备努力做到金笔接近“派克”的水平，铅笔接近“维纳斯”的水平。因为限于原料、设备、技术等条件，这种产品只能先试制少量，另出牌号、另订价格。如果想一下子把某一种原有产品全部提高到接近国际水平，是脱离实际的。高级产品的一部分原料必要时需要进口，应请政府考虑批准，例如现在还有“维纳斯”铅笔进口，如果我们能进口高级木材做出高级铅笔来代替同等数量的“维纳斯”铅笔，可以节省外汇十倍以上，并且高级产品还可以争取出口。
　　二、节约方面改变产品规格节约材料；根据销售对象节约包装；充分利用原有设备；广泛开展收集废料工作。
    （1）在保证使用价值不降低的原则下，提倡改变规格节约原材料。例如普通铅笔杆径7.65公厘，细杆铅笔杆径5.90公厘，铅心使用价值相同，特别是小学生用不会嫌细，因此就应当提倡多用细杆铅笔。细杆比普通杆可以节约木材5％以上，油漆60％以上，节约的原料又可增产，同时成本降低可以减轻消费者的负担。（2）根据不同的销售对象节约装璜包装材料。对于外销商品必须讲究装璜包装，否则不利于国际市场的推销。对于内销商品可以节约装璜包装，尤其是在本地销售的更可从简，但又要防止过简反致影响使用价值。例如听说由于纸张供应紧张有一时期橡胶鞋既没有盒子，也不用纸包，在商店里弄脏变色就是片面节约了。（3）合理使用基建投资。增产应当充分利用原有设备，利用手工或半手工操作，不必完全追求机械化自动化，原有设备真不够也可考虑采用两班或三班制，这样可以扩大就业，减少投资。但是凡属可以提高质量、增加品种、节约原材料、争取出口的投资以及购买仪器图书的费用，希望能够尽量不削减。（4）广泛开展收集废料工作。目前的情况是人民还有很多不知道废料可以回炉再用的重大意义以及收集废料工作还待改进。例如旧报纸、玻璃瓶、牙膏管、旧胶鞋、旧铝锅、旧塑胶、自来水笔的笔尖等等都可回炉再用，以及这些原材料缺乏的情况一般人并不完全知道，必须加强宣传。另外一方面废品公司设站太少，手续太繁，定价偏低，以致有人不愿意去。还有处理不当，分类不细以致优材劣用，上海在有一时期还取消了小商贩代收废料，这些情况都必须改进。有人建议百货商店代收废品，照价以旧易新，我们认为可以考虑。
　　三、　计划方面反对虚报毛估；防止盲目要货；克服本位主义；计划不要太死。
    （1）反对虚报毛估和加三放尺的计划。有些需用原材料的单位把库存量故意以多报少，把需用量又毛估放大，准备上级削减时可以得到实际需用量。甚至层层加码，逐级虚报，以致到中央完全脱离实际。如果中央如数批准又弄得手足无措，严重影响国家总的计划供应并造成浪费。例如上海造纸工业在今年毛估水泥需要量为4，000吨，第一季度中央照拨了1，800吨就弄得很紧张，同时还因为水泥不打折扣而别的材料如钢筋砖瓦等又打了折扣，也无法进行基建，以致积压资金，如果放久变质又将造成浪费。上海造纸工业方面在水泥紧张时虚报毛估是要反对的，同时它们也希望在上级审查计划时对于批准的某一项基建工程，必须供应这一工程的全部材料。（2）防止盲目要货计划。据闻在供销平衡会议上各地代表对于那种货适合于那种销路，不见得都是心中有数，看见你要我也要，尤其是抢名牌货。例如26号金星金笔是20多年的老样子还是大家抢。工业部门供不应求，可是消费者是否满意呢？很多人就问我们这种粗笨的样子为什么老不改？商业部门盲目要货，工业部门奉命照做，就会影响改进。同时还会造成此处脱销和彼处积压。（3）克服本位主义思想。毛主席指示在第二个五年计划中重轻工业的投资比例要考虑降低为六比一，为了满足人民需要和更有利于工业化是正确的，但这决不是说所有各种各地的轻工业都要平均增加投资。例如卷烟设备利用率才到35.5％，火柴还有积压，当然不必投资和增产。同时各地也要克服本位主义，例如上海的铅笔产量占全国产量的百分比，在解放后已自80％左右逐渐降低到今年的48％（由于内地增加了工厂和增加了生产）。在第二个五年计划期内按照中央的计划和上海的生产能力，将还要降低百分比，我们认为就不必保持原有48％的比例，只须在充分利用原有设备下适当增产，不必再投资另建新厂增产，因为主要的原料木材是从东北来的，上海附近目前尚难找到合用的木材，新厂应考虑就近原料产地。（4）某些计划不要订得太死太机械。例如轻工业产品自来水笔只要订总产量多少，产值多少，上缴利润多少，节约指标多少，至于其中金笔、铱金笔、钢笔的品种百分比就不必订得太死，可以由地方的工业与商业部门根据市场需要及原料供应等具体情况来制订，借以避免生产上的停工待料或是赶任务以及销售上的积压脱销，这都会造成浪费。
　　四、　价格问题应在不影响上缴利润的原则下调整价格；应在降低商品利润的情况下维持工业生产。
    （1）可否考虑在不影响上缴利润的原则下调整价格。现在商业部门的售价不动，也会引起浪费。例如前面所说铱金笔比钢笔使用价值增加一倍，为什么商业部门还未同意多产铱金笔逐步取消钢笔呢？据商业部门说因为钢笔销路好，铱金笔有积压。我们的看法，认为主要是价格订得不合理，同时宣传工作做得太差。因为铱金笔零售每支价格是1.60元左右，钢笔只0.90元左右，差0.70元一支，在人们不知道它的使用价值高一倍以前就要买便宜的钢笔了。还有一个例子可以说明价格定的太不合理。假如有一个精明的消费者，他可以花九角钱买一支钢笔，在用坏了钢笔尖以后再花两角钱就可以换一只铱金笔尖，一共花了1.10元就可以获得一支钢笔，一支铱金笔的使用价值，而单独买一支铱金笔就要化1.60元左右。为什么定价这样不合理呢？这是因为钢笔厂以往盲目发展，为了贯彻利用、限制、改造的政策，所以钢笔核价很低，有些厂要亏本，商业部门利润亦很低，有几种笔也要亏本。铱金笔为什么定价高呢？这是因为铱金笔在新产品时产量少，成本及核价均较高，后来虽逐步因产量增加成本减低而核低，但利润还是较高。因此我们认为在不影响上缴利润的原则下适当调高钢笔价格，调低铱金笔价格，并做好宣传工作是必要的。这样既可兼顾增产节约，又使工商业两部门都不亏本，还使消费者受到实惠，真是一举数得。（2）应在降低商业利润的情况下维持工业生产。据上海化工原料业反映：铁路用的氟化钠防腐剂，现在改进技术用新法成本只要1，420元一吨，过去成本高要2，000元一吨，因此核定牌价为2，300元一吨，商业利润就偏高了。最近因沈阳出品直接调拨可按1，700元一吨，铁道部门希望降低牌价仍买上海货，可是上海化工供应站因牌价冻结不同意，上海方面势将停工。我们认为应降低商业利润维持上海生产。
    以上这些意见大都是结合上海制笔工业公司的工作，根据我们本位业务的角度提出的，既不成熟，又不全面，希望供有关方面的参考并获得指正。（附图片）
