Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 28th – Chengdu State-owned Department Store is actively organizing sources of goods to prepare for the supply of summer goods as early as possible.

Since the launch of the increase production and practice economy campaign, the sales of some high-end consumer goods in the Chengdu market have declined, and many government departments and institutions have cancelled their order plans. This has led many employees in commercial departments to one-sidedly believe that the purchasing power of the people has decreased, and the situation of tight supply of certain commodities has been eliminated. They have developed the idea of fearing stockpiles and not fearing out-of-stock situations, and therefore are not actively organizing purchases. In response to this idea, the Chengdu State-owned Department Store recently held a meeting of planning, business, and purchasing personnel, where it analyzed the current market situation. It was determined that although the sales of high-end consumer goods have declined, the sales of daily necessities and some seasonal commodities have increased compared to the past. This shows that the people's legitimate consumption has not decreased. At the same time, according to the results of surveys conducted among consumers, it has also been proven that the demand for various commodities needed by the masses this summer will still increase to varying degrees, and commercial departments have the responsibility to do a good job in supplying summer commodities. Therefore, the Chengdu Department Store has arranged a commodity supply plan for the second quarter based on these circumstances. For some commodities that are relatively scarce, it is preparing to solve the problem through mutual adjustments with fraternal companies in other places. For some sources of goods that can be processed and purchased within the region, detailed arrangements have also been made. In order to make up for the shortage of goods, the company has decided to process cadre clothing and women's shirts in its own sewing factory. It has also decided to prepare the raw materials needed by processing units for mosquito nets, oilcloth, and children's clothing as early as possible. In addition, personnel will be sent to other provinces to make purchases.

    开展增产节约运动以后人民正当消费并未减少
    成都市百货公司积极准备夏季商品
    新华社成都28日电  成都市国营百货公司积极组织货源，为夏季商品的供应工作及早作好准备。
    自从开展增产节约运动以来，成都市场一些高级消费品的销量下降，许多机关单位撤销了要货计划。这使不少商业部门的职工片面地认为人民群众的购买力下降，某些商品供应紧张的情况消除了，产生了怕积压不怕脱销的思想，因而不积极组织进货。针对这种思想，成都市国营百货公司在最近召开的计划、业务、采购人员会议上，对当前的市场情况进行了分析，认为目前虽然高级消费品销售量下降，但日用百货和一些时令商品的销售量却比以前上升，这说明人们的正当消费并未减少；同时，根据向消费者调查的结果也证明今年夏季群众所需的各种商品仍有不同程度的增加，商业部门有责任做好夏令商品的供应工作。因此成都市百货公司已根据这些情况安排了第二季度商品供应计划；对于一些货源比较缺乏的商品，准备通过与外地兄弟公司互相调剂解决；对于一些可以在区内加工采购的货源，也作了细致安排。为了弥补货源的不足，这个公司决定把干部服装和女衬衫等由自己的缝纫工厂加工。对蚊帐、油布、童装等，也决定及早准备供给加工单位需要的原材料。此外，并将派出人员到省外采购。
