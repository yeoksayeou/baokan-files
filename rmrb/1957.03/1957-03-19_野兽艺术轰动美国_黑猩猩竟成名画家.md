Xinhua News Agency, New York, 16th (TASS dispatch): American newspapers recently published a sensational piece of news stating that a new "master" has emerged in the American art world - Betsy, a chimpanzee from the Baltimore Zoo. The paintings "painted" by this chimpanzee have received "high" praise from some American painters. Some newspapers even say that the paintings made by some figures in the American bourgeois art world are not much better than the works of the zoo's "master."

The newspaper also reported that a group of "ultra-modern abstract" painters in Berkeley (California) are currently preparing to hold an exhibition of their works, and they have decided to invite Betsy to participate in the exhibition. They also said that they will send a delegation to Baltimore to study the chimpanzee's "paintings."

    野兽艺术轰动美国  黑猩猩竟成名画家
    据新华社18日讯　据塔斯社纽约16日讯：美国报刊最近刊登一则耸人听闻的消息说，美国绘画界出现了一个新“巨匠”——巴尔的摩动物园的黑猩猩别特西。这个黑猩猩“画”的画得到了某些美国画家“很高”的评价。某些报纸还说，美国资产阶级绘画界的某些人物所作的画比动物园的“巨匠”的作品好不了多少。
    报纸还报道，柏克莱城（加利福尼亚州）的一批“超现代抽象派”画家现在正在筹备举行一个他们的作品展览会，他们决定将邀请别特西参加展览会，并且说，他们将派代表团去巴尔的摩研究黑猩猩的“画”。
