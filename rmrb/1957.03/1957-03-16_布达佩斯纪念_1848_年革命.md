Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 15th: A commemorative meeting was held in Budapest, the capital of Hungary, on the evening of the 14th to commemorate the 109th anniversary (March 15th) of the Hungarian bourgeois revolution and national independence struggle of 1848-1849.

　　The conference was jointly convened by the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, the Provisional Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party, the National Federation of Free Trade Unions, and other social organizations.

　　Gathered at the venue were working people from various factories in the capital, people from the scientific and cultural circles, students, and representatives of the armed forces.

　　Prime Minister Kadar and other national and party leaders also attended the meeting.

　　Gyula Kállai, Secretary of the Provisional Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and Minister of Culture, delivered a report on the commemoration.

　　He said that today is the twelfth time since liberation that we commemorate this day in accordance with its historical role and revolutionary significance. Last October, the counter-revolutionary riots that occurred in Hungary tarnished the pure flag of the 1848 revolution. The reactionaries, in order to restore the rule of the exploiting classes, once again attempted to distort and utilize the legacy of the 1848 revolution, attempting to portray the counter-revolution as a national revolution.

　　The reporter said that we are members of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, and we are linked by proletarian internationalism. Therefore, in the struggle against counter-revolution, the entire world socialist camp stood on our side as one, and we achieved victory.

　　The reporter said that one of the most important lessons of the 1848 revolution and the counter-revolutionary rebellion last October is that in order to defeat foreign reactionary forces, domestic reactionary forces must be eliminated. But what did Nagy Imre and his accomplices do? They opposed the mistakes of Rakosi's leadership, but used these mistakes to distort the slogans of democracy. They announced a multi-party system, promised freedom of activity to bourgeois restoration parties, insisted on breaking away from the socialist camp, insisted on abolishing the Warsaw Pact, advocated so-called "neutrality" under the protection of Western imperialists, and remained silent as white terror enveloped the leading force of the proletarian dictatorship—the Hungarian Working People's Party and its leaders.

　　The reporter also criticized the trend of national communism.

　　The reporter then said that we should be ashamed to say that some Hungarian writers, journalists, and university students betrayed the heroes and ideals of 1848. Some of our writers still do not know or do not want to understand the historical process that Petőfi (note: the leader of the 1848-1849 revolution) had already fully and clearly understood more than a century ago. Petőfi did not separate the ideals of the bourgeois revolution from the cause of freedom all over the world, but now there are some "Marxists" who want to separate the cause of socialism from the idea of proletarian internationalism.

    布达佩斯纪念1848年革命
    据新华社布达佩斯15日电  匈牙利首都布达佩斯14日晚上举行纪念大会，纪念1848—1849年匈牙利资产阶级革命和民族独立斗争一百零九周年（3月15日）。
    这次大会是由匈牙利工农革命政府、社会主义工人党临时中央委员会、自由工会全国联合会以及其他社会团体联合召开的。
    会场上聚集着首都各工厂的劳动人民、科学和文化界人士、学生和武装部队的代表。
    卡达尔总理以及国家和党的其他领导人也参加了大会。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党临时中央委员会书记、文化部长卡拉伊·久洛作了关于纪念节日的报告。
    他说，今天我们是解放以来第十二次按照这个日子的历史作用和革命意义来纪念它。去年10月，匈牙利所发生的反革命暴动玷污了1848年革命的纯洁的旗帜。反动派为了想恢复剥削阶级的统治，再一次企图歪曲和利用1848年革命的遗产，企图把反革命说成是民族革命。
    报告人说，我们是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的成员，我们被无产阶级国际主义联系在一起，因此，在同反革命斗争中，整个世界社会主义阵营像一个人一样站在我们这方面，我们获得了胜利。
    报告人说，1848年和去年10月反革命叛乱最重要的教训之一是，要想战胜国外反动势力，就必须消灭国内反动势力。但是，纳吉·伊姆雷及其帮手们做了些什么呢？他们反对拉科西领导的错误，但是利用这些错误去歪曲民主主义的口号。他们宣布多党制，允诺资产阶级复辟政党的自由活动，坚持脱离社会主义阵营，坚持废止华沙条约，主张在西方帝国主义者保护下的所谓“中立”，眼看着白色恐怖笼罩着无产阶级专政领导力量——匈牙利劳动人民党及其领导者，却默不作声。
    报告人还抨击了民族共产主义的思潮。
    报告人接着说，我们应该很惭愧地说，一部分匈牙利的作家、记者和大学生背叛了1848年的英雄和理想。我们的某些作家直到今天还不知道或者不想理解裴多菲（按：是1848—1849年革命的领导者）在一百多年以前就已经完全明确理解的历史进程。裴多菲没有把资产阶级革命的理想和全世界的自由事业分割开来，而现在有这样一些“马克思主义者”，他们想把社会主义事业和无产阶级国际主义的思想分割开来。
