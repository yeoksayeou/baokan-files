I'd like to talk about the changes in Tianjin's industrial and commercial circles over the past year and the current problems.

    The Mainstream of Thought Among Industrialists and Businessmen is a Desire for Progress, with Great Personal Changes

Since the high tide of full industry-wide public-private partnership, industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin have generally understood that they must gradually transform themselves into self-reliant laborers through study and practical work to have a bright and happy future. At the same time, under the guidance of the Party's great policies and meticulous care, work and life have generally been properly arranged. Therefore, the vast majority are eager to learn and progress, hoping to do their jobs well and strive for positive performance. This initiative is first reflected in the sharp increase in the number of people participating in learning, increasing from 10% before the public-private partnership to 80% of the total number of industrialists and businessmen in the city, with very high enthusiasm for learning; secondly, more and more people are participating in socialist competitions, with the number of people receiving the honorary titles of advanced producers and advanced workers increasing quarter by quarter, totaling more than 2,700 people in the first to third quarters of last year, and the fourth quarter has not yet been fully evaluated, but according to current data, there are already more than 1,500 people, and more than 2,950 people have been commended and rewarded in the three quarters combined. Therefore, in the past year, the mainstream of thought among industrialists and businessmen has been a desire for progress, and personal changes have been great.

    The Relationship Between Public and Private Partnership is Gradually Becoming Normal, but Further Improvement is Needed

After the full industry-wide public-private partnership, some problems existed in the relationship between public and private partners in some joint ventures, which affected the enthusiasm of private personnel to varying degrees. The Party and the government took effective measures in a timely manner, conducting publicity and implementation of the purchase policy and socialist education to public, employee and private personnel, making this relationship gradually return to normal. However, class perceptions cannot be changed overnight, and the old ideological consciousness and management style of private personnel cannot be overcome in a short period of time. Therefore, superficially, the relationship between public and private partnership does not seem to be a major problem, but in reality, it still needs to be further improved. In Tianjin, various specialized companies have focused on economic restructuring and production and operation improvement work in the past six months, and the transformation of private industry and commerce has not been grasped tightly enough; trade unions have also been busy with production competitions, and the implementation of the redemption policy among the masses of employees has not been detailed and in-depth enough, especially at the grassroots level, where many problems still exist; at the same time, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC) and the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA) have given more emphasis to general principles in this work, and less to specifically helping solve ideological problems, failing to continue to delve deeper. As a result, the problems have been latent and cannot be well resolved.

Because of the existence of this situation, some private personnel have felt depressed, and many have emphasized that to improve the relationship between public and private partnership, it is necessary to remove the capitalist label. Therefore, for a time, many people requested to give up fixed interest and remove the label. Through the Second Congress of Members of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, this confused thinking was clarified, clarifying that the key lies in how to strengthen self-transformation and change the perceptions of public and employee personnel with practical actions.

The spirit and resolutions of the Second Congress of the ACFIC, as well as the cordial instructions of Chairman Mao and central leaders, have been implemented in Tianjin's industrial and commercial circles to representative figures at the municipal and district levels, and are now continuing to be implemented to households at all levels. Through dissemination and implementation, it is generally recognized that the state's redemption policy is mainly to allow industrialists and businessmen to study, work, and accept transformation with peace of mind. At the same time, it also clarifies the current tasks and directions of efforts for industrialists and businessmen, who must strengthen learning, work hard, improve patriotic ideology, oppose individualism, practice increased production and conservation, establish a style of hard work and simplicity, and fully play the positive role of "wealth" to contribute to national construction.

    The Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement Has Been Launched, and Some Shortcomings Need to Be Overcome Jointly by the Public and Private Sectors

The increase production and practice economy movement in Tianjin has been actively launched under the leadership and vigorous promotion of party and government departments, and has focused on exposing waste. It is understood that due to poor production and operation management, the Rubber Industry Company alone wasted 103,400 work hours throughout the year due to unreasonable labor organization and failure of scheduling work, equivalent to 517 people not producing for a month; due to a lack of planning, the rubber shoe factory did not properly consider storing the qualified old semi-finished products when changing specifications and patterns in 1956, resulting in a large amount of scrapped material, with more than 30,000 pairs of shoe uppers alone being scrapped. The Coal Industry Company also caused a lot of waste in coal storage and transportation due to poor operation and management and lack of planning, which not only caused a shortage of coal for citizens in winter, but also wasted a lot of coal; before the public-private partnership, the entire private sector in the industry could earn a surplus in addition to paying 360,000 to 400,000 yuan in taxes each year, but in the year after the public-private partnership, it not only did not turn over profits to the state, but also lost more than 290,000 yuan. Excessive non-production personnel in joint ventures and huge expenses, which increased costs, are also serious waste, with non-production personnel accounting for 23% of all production personnel in the Printing Industry Company, and some factories in the Rubber Company accounting for 50%. There are many other waste phenomena that cannot be listed one by one.

I believe that both public and private employee personnel in joint ventures should be responsible for the existence of this phenomenon and must work together to fully utilize positive factors and earnestly overcome it.

At present, the public sector in joint ventures still does not pay enough attention to the rationalization proposals of private personnel, which affects the exertion of the enthusiasm of private personnel and also affects the further improvement of the co-work relationship. For example, the private person in charge of the laboratory of Lizhong Acid Plant successfully experimented with extracting and recovering zinc sulfate from sulfuric acid solution of welding lead, which can save more than 6,000 yuan per year, but the proposal has not been adopted for more than half a year. Recently, he also proposed the reconstruction of a double-layer ore furnace. If it can be realized, it can save more than 40,000 yuan throughout the year, and at the same time increase the production of sulfuric acid by 15%-20%, and the cost will naturally be reduced, but it has not been taken seriously. The private technical section chief of Jingu Rubber Factory suggested reducing the rubber content of rainproof cloth from 60% to 50%-55%, which not only saves rubber materials, but also doubles the service life of the cloth, but his cultural level is very low. This suggestion is based on many years of work experience and lacks theoretical basis. The public sector asked him for a theoretical basis, which made him feel embarrassed and emotionally negative. In my personal opinion, there are still not a few technicians like this who only rely on experience and lack theoretical knowledge today. We should make full use of these experienced technologies and organize technicians with scientific and theoretical knowledge to help these people conduct research, and should not pour cold water on them.

As for the private personnel, many have clearly defined their future direction of efforts, actively invested in the increase production and practice economy movement, and have made many achievements. However, some people subjectively want to do a good job and are willing to work hard, but due to the influence of class instincts, old ideological consciousness and management style are constantly reflected in their work, which has caused certain losses to the work. For example, a private person in charge of supply and marketing in an industrial company is very active in his work. In order to ensure the timely supply of raw materials, he has excessively stockpiled, which not only accumulated a large amount of funds, but also indirectly affected the production of raw material factories; in order to increase production and conservation, some retail outlets of the Coal Industry Company mixed a large amount of coal stones, which had been picked out due to improved quality after the public-private partnership, into winter coal and quickly sold them by taking advantage of the tight supply. Although these styles have been discovered and corrected in a timely manner, they have caused certain losses to the country and the people.

    The Bourgeoisie's Two-Sidedness Still Exists, and Capitalists Should Intensify Their Study

In addition, some people have poor learning foundations, low ideological awareness, and more serious bourgeois individualism, and often put personal interests first. Therefore, they show various negative factors. For example, some people were careful and thrifty in their enterprises when they were private, but after the public-private partnership, they believed that the good or bad of the enterprise had nothing to do with them, and thus produced employment thinking; some people felt inferior because their subjective requirements were not met or they encountered setbacks in their work, and held a negative thinking of "doing the clock as a monk for a day" and an irresponsible attitude; there was even the guest thinking that "Lin Daiyu lives in Jia's house, after all, is an outsider," and they were hesitant in their work, dare not boldly take responsibility or were unwilling to take responsibility.

Some people think that they have certain skills and expertise, and they are proud and complacent, look down on the public and employees, and even refuse to obey the leadership of the public and the supervision of the working class. These people are mostly dissatisfied with reality, full of complaints, and do not sincerely and honestly contribute their technical talents to the country.

After economic restructuring, merging factories and shops, the disunity between private individuals has become more superficial, mainly reflecting the specific manifestations of individualism such as competing for reputation, status, and treatment. This phenomenon is still growing and must be overcome and corrected in a timely manner.

Since the Party Central Committee clearly stipulated a fixed interest rate of seven years and that small industrialists and businessmen can be renamed petty bourgeoisie, both large and small households have felt that they have found their place and can live in peace, but many people have also developed a slack attitude towards self-transformation. Some people in large households believe that they can "have a big sleep in five years and transform in two years," while others are thinking of "filling their pockets with money before entering socialism"; some people in small and medium-sized households believe that since they can be renamed petty bourgeoisie, it is clear that they are different from the large bourgeoisie, and there is no need to transform anymore; some people even deny the existence of two-sidedness and no longer accept transformation with peace of mind.

In general, these unhealthy ideological situations are precisely the spread of bourgeois ideology, and they are also specific manifestations of the continued existence of two-sidedness. Chairman Mao taught us last year that it is in line with the facts to say that the Chinese national bourgeoisie has two-sidedness. Therefore, capitalists have a task to study. At the enlarged meeting of the Supreme State Conference a few days ago, Chairman Mao once again clearly raised the issue of the continued existence of two-sidedness, encouraging us to intensify our study. Therefore, we must attach importance to this issue. We must be determined to intensify our study, improve our political awareness, strengthen our patriotic ideology, oppose individualism, practice economy and frugality, and gradually achieve the goal of destroying capitalism and establishing socialism through work practice. Guiding and supervising the realization of this goal is, of course, the main task of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC) and the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA). At the same time, the Party and the government are also required to continue to strengthen leadership and education, and it is hoped that social forces at all levels will strongly assist in supervising and promoting this transformation so that it can be successfully completed.

    朱继圣谈天津工商界的变化和存在的问题
    肯定资本家还要努力学习加紧改造
    我谈一谈天津市工商界一年来的变化和目前存在的问题。
    工商业者思想主流是要求进步的，个人变化也很大
    自从全行业合营高潮后，天津市工商业者一般都明确了个人必须通过学习和工作实践，逐步改造成为一个自食其力的劳动者，才有光明幸福的前途。同时，在党的伟大政策的指导和无微不至的关怀照顾下，工作、生活一般都得到妥善的安排。因此，绝大多数人都迫切要求学习、要求进步，希望作好本职工作，争取积极表现。这种积极性的发挥，首先表现在参加学习的人数急骤增加，按全市工商业者总人数来看，由合营前的10％增加到80％，学习热情也非常高涨；其次是越来越多的人参加了社会主义竞赛，获得先进生产者和先进工作者的荣誉称号的，逐季度增加，去年一至三季度累计共二千七百多人，第四季度还未评选完毕，根据目前资料已有一千五百多人，受到表扬和奖励的，三个季度累计也有二千九百五十多人。因此说，过去一年来，工商业者的思想主流是要求进步的，个人的变化也是很大的。
    公私共事关系逐步走向正常，但也需要进一步加以改善
    全业合营后，部分合营企业的公私共事关系存在一些问题，曾在不同程度上影响了私方人员的积极性，党和政府及时采取了有效措施，向公方、职工和私方人员分别进行了对购买政策的宣传贯彻和社会主义教育，使这种关系逐步走向正常。但阶级观感不是一下子就能转变过来的，私方人员旧的思想意识和经营作风也不是短时期所能克服掉的，所以从表面上看，公私共事关系问题不大，实际仍有待于进一步的改善。就天津市来说，各专业公司近半年来着重于经济改组和生产经营改进工作，对私改造工作抓的不够紧；工会方面也忙于搞生产竞赛，对职工群众贯彻赎买政策也还不够细致深入，特别是基层方面还存在不少问题；同时，工商联及民建会对这一工作，也是大道理讲的多，具体帮助解决思想问题作得比较少，没有能够继续深入下去，这样，就使问题潜伏下来，不能得到很好的解决。
    正由于这种情况的存在，一部分私方人员在心情上就产生了苦闷，不少人强调要搞好公私共事关系，必须摘掉资本家帽子，因而一时有很多人要求放弃定息、要求摘帽子。通过全国工商联二届会员代表大会，这种混乱思想才得到澄清，明确了关键在于如何加强自我改造，用实际行动来改变公方、职工的观感。
    全联二届代表大会的精神和决议，以及毛主席和中央首长的亲切指示，在天津市工商界已经贯彻到市区两级代表性人士，现正继续层层深入贯彻到户。通过传达贯彻，一般都认识到国家采取的赎买政策，主要是为了工商业者得以安心学习，安心工作，安心接受改造。同时也明确了工商业者当前的任务和努力方向，必须要加强学习，努力工作，提高爱国主义思想，反对个人主义，厉行增产节约，树立艰苦朴素作风，充分发挥“财富”的积极作用，为祖国建设贡献力量。
    增产节约运动已开展起来，有些缺点需要公私双方共同设法克服
    天津市的增产节约运动，在党政部门的领导和大力推动下，已经积极开展起来，并重点地揭发了浪费现象。据了解，仅橡胶工业公司由于生产经营管理不善，单从劳动组织不合理、调度工作跟不上去所造成的浪费，全年就达十万零三千四百个工时，相当于五百一十七人一个月没有生产；由于计划性不强，胶鞋厂在1956年改变规格花样时，对合规格的旧半成品没有很好的考虑储存，造成大量报废，只鞋帮一项就报废了三万多双。煤业公司也由于经营管理不善和计划性不强，不但使市民冬季用煤发生了紧张现象，而且在储煤、运输各方面也造成了不少的浪费；该业未合营前，全业私营户除每年交纳税款三十六—四十万元外，还有盈余可得，合营后一年来，不仅没向国家上缴利润，还亏损了二十九万多元。合营企业内非生产人员过多，开支庞大，加大成本，也是严重的浪费现象，印刷工业公司非生产人员占全部生产人员23％，橡胶公司有的厂占到50％。其他的浪费现象还很多，不能一一例举。
    这种现象的存在，我认为合营企业的公方职工和私方人员都应该负责，必须共同协力，充分发挥积极因素，认真地加以克服。
    目前，合营企业的公方对私方人员的合理化建议有的仍然不够重视，这是影响私方人员积极性的发挥的，同时，也影响着共事关系进一步的改善。例如利中酸厂化验室私方负责人从焊铅的硫酸溶液中提炼回收硫酸锌试验成功，每年可节约六千多元，提出建议后半年多未见采纳，最近又提出改建双层矿炉的建议，如能实现全年可节约四万余元，同时还可增产15％—20％的硫酸，成本自然降低，也未受到重视。津沽橡胶厂私方技术科长建议把防雨布的含胶量从60％降低到50％—55％，不但节约胶料，还使布的使用寿命延长一倍，但是他文化水平很低，这个建议是根据多年工作经验提出的，缺乏理论根据，公方向他要理论根据，使他感到为难而情绪消极。个人意见，今天在技术人员中像这样只凭经验而缺乏理论知识的人还不是少数，我们要充分利用这些经验技术，并应组织有科学理论知识的技术人员帮助这些人进行研究，不应向他们头上浇冷水。
    至于在私方人员中，确已有不少人明确了今后的努力方向，积极投入增产节约运动中，并已作出了不少的成绩。但也有的人主观的想把工作做好，也努力肯干，只是受到阶级本能的影响，旧的思想意识和经营作风不断地反映到工作上去，反而使工作受到了一定的损失。如某工业公司负责供销的私方人员，工作很积极，为了原料供应及时，过多地进行储备，不仅积压了大量资金，并间接影响了原料工厂的生产；煤业部分门市部为了增产节约，把在合营后提高质量捡出的煤石，大量掺入冬煤里，并利用供应紧张机会，很快地销售出去。这些作风虽已及时发现纠正，但已给国家和人民造成一定的损失。
    资产阶级两面性依然存在，资本家应加紧学习
    另有一部分人由于学习基础较差，思想觉悟不高，资产阶级个人主义思想比较严重，经常把个人利益放在第一位，因此，表现了各式各样的消极因素。例如有些人过去在私营时对于企业精打细算，克勤克俭，合营后认为企业好坏与我无关，从而产生雇佣思想；有的人由于主观要求得不到满足，或在工作中遇到挫折，便产生了自卑感，抱着“当一天和尚撞一天钟”的消极思想和不负责的态度；甚至存在着“林黛玉住在贾家，终究是外人”的作客思想，工作缩手缩脚，不敢大胆负责或不肯负责。
    还有些人认为自己有一定的技能和专长，便骄傲自满，看不起公方和职工，甚至不肯服从公方的领导和工人阶级的监督，这些人多是不满现实、牢骚满腹，而不是忠诚老实地把自己的技术才能贡献给国家。
    在经济改组、并厂并店之后，私私之间的不团结现象更形表面化，主要是争名誉、争地位、争待遇等等个人主义思想的具体反映。这种现象还在不断滋长，必须及时加以克服纠正。
    自从党中央明确定息七年和小型工商业者可以改称小资产阶级以后，大中小户一致感到各得其所、各安其心，但也有不少人对自我改造产生了松劲思想。在大户中有人认为可以“五年大觉、两年改造”，有的在想“装满钞票再进社会主义”；在中小户中有人认为既然可以改称大小资产阶级，可见与大资产阶级不同，没有必要再改造了；甚至有的人否认两面性的存在，不再安心接受改造。
    这些不健康的思想情况，总的来说，正是资产阶级思想的泛滥，也正是两面性依然存在的具体反映。毛主席去年教导我们说：中国民族资产阶级有两面性，这样说是合乎事实的，因此，资本家有一个任务，要学习。前几天最高国务会议扩大会上，主席又一次明确提出两面性依然存在的问题，鼓励我们要加紧学习。因此，我们必须重视这一问题，我们一定要下决心，加紧学习，提高政治觉悟，加强爱国主义思想，反对个人主义，厉行节约、艰苦朴素，并通过工作实践，逐步达到破资本主义、立社会主义的目的。辅导督促实现这个目的，当然是工商联和民建会的主要任务，同时，还要求党和政府继续加强领导教育，并希望各阶层的社会力量大力协助督促推动，使这一改造工作得以顺利完成。（附图片）
