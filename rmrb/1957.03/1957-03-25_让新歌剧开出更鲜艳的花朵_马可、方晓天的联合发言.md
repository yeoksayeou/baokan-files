    Let New Opera Bloom More Vividly
　　Joint Speech by Ma Ke and Fang Xiaotian
    We wholeheartedly support the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" in cultural and ideological work. Here, we would like to share our experiences and opinions on new opera work.

      The young art of new opera has grown, but it lags behind the demands of the people.
    New opera is an art form jointly explored and created by many drama and music workers since the "May Fourth" New Culture Movement. It is very young, but it has a glorious tradition of reflecting the people's real struggles and serving the revolutionary cause. Especially after the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," which clarified the direction of art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, correctly solved the relationship between popularization and improvement, inheriting national cultural heritage, and drawing on foreign cultural experience, the New Yangko Movement was launched, and works such as "Brother and Sister Cultivating Wasteland" and "The White-Haired Girl" were produced, and new opera grew up. At that time, the new opera workers, with full political enthusiasm, actively intervened in life, went deep into the masses, and learned humbly. Their creations had a strong sense of the times and class feelings, becoming a powerful weapon for the people to carry out liberation struggles and self-education.

    After the national liberation, the situation underwent new changes. New opera faced the task of improving artistic quality, establishing theater art, and winning over a wide audience in order to better serve the construction of socialism. In the past few years, under the leadership and support of the Party and the government, the efforts of new opera workers have achieved many successes. In terms of creation, works such as "Chi Ye River," "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," "Spark," "Liu Hulan," "Song of the Prairie," and "A Volunteer's Fiancee" that were welcomed by audiences were produced. These works have improved in many ways compared to the past. In terms of learning, thanks to a relatively stable environment, the professional skills of new opera workers have improved significantly. In particular, great achievements have been made in learning from national opera heritage and Western opera (many new opera actors have learned folk and classical opera programs with high skills, and some opera groups have been able to perform or rehearse foreign operas such as "La Traviata," "The Bartered Bride," and "The Little Cow" in a short period of time). In terms of performance, several professional new opera groups have worked tirelessly in the past few years. Under the conditions of lacking a repertoire and theatrical art experience, they have overcome many difficulties and completed the performance tasks. Taking the Central Experimental Opera House as an example, it performed 421 shows in the past year, with an audience of more than 840,000, and an average attendance rate of over 98%. Local and military opera troupes and cultural and art troupes also adopted methods such as theater performances, square performances, and tours to popularize new opera among the masses. It is also worth mentioning that our young new opera art has been warmly welcomed in foreign performances. Whether it is performed by Chinese art groups (such as "The White-Haired Girl") or rehearsed by foreign opera houses (such as "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang"), the programs have been praised by foreign artists and the general public.

    Although new opera has achieved such achievements, it is far behind compared with our large country and the growing demands of the people. This is true whether from the creation of new opera, the performance groups, and the quality or quantity of performances. In particular, there is not enough activity in creation, lacking a strong and moving atmosphere of life, and the forms of expression are not intimate and perfect enough. Therefore, the audience often gives benevolent criticism in this regard. The main reasons for these shortcomings are: in the subjective aspect of new opera workers, there is still a tendency to be detached from politics and life. The fiery combat style and the fine tradition of close ties with the masses during the Yangko Movement have not been further promoted; although it is verbally believed that the tradition of national drama and music should be inherited, in fact, it is not learned enough, and there are many rules and regulations in the learning process; at the same time, whether in learning from national and foreign advanced art, there are still shortcomings and errors of dogmatism and purely technical viewpoints. These have hindered the further improvement of new opera and prevented new opera from better combining with the people. In addition to the subjective reasons of new opera workers, there have been some unfavorable situations in the objective conditions for the development of new opera in the past few years. For example, after the national cultural and art troupe reorganization and the first national opera festival, the contraction of new opera groups was too large and too rapid, and there was a lack of proper arrangements. The elaboration of the relationship between new opera and opera reform was not clear enough in the work policy, and in some places the two were even confused, which had a negative impact on the development of new opera. Of course, the problems in the development of new opera and the methods to solve the problems should mainly be explored from the basic aspects of the artistic laws of new opera and the relationship between new opera and the masses. As new opera workers, we must strive to solve our own ideological problems and the problems existing in art and technology; at the same time, we would also like to take this opportunity to appeal to the leadership, public opinion, writers, and comrades in the opera circles, hoping that everyone will pay more attention to and support the young flower of new opera.

      Hope that all parties will pay more attention to and support new opera, so that it can flourish in the competition of a hundred flowers.
    First of all, in terms of creation, I hope that writers will be more active in creating scripts for new opera, and composers will be more active in composing music for new opera. There are not many traditional programs of new opera. At present, new opera groups cannot perform in fixed theaters with a repertoire in rotation like opera troupes. Therefore, we must strengthen creation and accumulate repertoire. The past creations of new opera mainly reflected the major themes of contemporary life. This is a good tradition and should be inherited, but this should not be the only aspect. Today, whether in terms of subject matter, genre, and style, it should be diversified. Myths, legends, historical themes, themes of brotherly nationalities, children's lives, and military lives can and should be written. Writers should be given greater freedom in genre and style to give play to their creative initiative. The critics should give more encouragement, support, and realistic analysis to the creation of new opera, starting from the existing level. Let the creation of new opera flourish and be enriched in the competition of a hundred flowers and in the test of the masses.

    In terms of new opera institutions, they should take the initiative and plan to contact writers, specifically help writers turn their creations into stage practice, and do not ask too much of new works at once, but gradually improve them through continuous practice and revision. In addition, in the process of organizing artistic production, we should pay attention to more scientific and reasonable allocation of labor, implement the spirit of streamlining and saving, and try to avoid waste of manpower and material resources. There are still serious problems in the training of actors that need to be solved. Due to the short history of new opera, there is no mature experience in the training of actors, and the requirements for actors are different for various groups and various programs. Therefore, the training of new opera actors in vocal music, performance, and dance is now inconsistent. Some older actors feel confused about how to further improve, and new actors often do not know where to start and feel overwhelmed. Of course, these problems cannot all be solved at once, but they should be put on the work agenda, study this aspect, and strengthen this aspect of the work.

    Recently, the National Drama Association and the Music Association jointly convened a symposium on new opera in Beijing. The comrades who participated in the meeting widely exchanged views on the problems existing in the development of new opera today and the future work policy, and reached a basic consensus. Government leaders are also paying attention to and strengthening the leadership work in this area, and are also considering the specific arrangements for new opera groups in the future. This is good news for the development of new opera. In the future, we hope to get the attention of people from all walks of life in society, especially hope that comrades in the opera circles can give more help to new opera workers, so that new opera workers can better inherit and promote the national heritage, so that new opera can bloom more vividly in the fertile land of China.

### 让新歌剧开出更鲜艳的花朵　马可、方晓天的联合发言

    让新歌剧开出更鲜艳的花朵
　　马可、方晓天的联合发言
    我们衷心地拥护党在文化、思想工作方面“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策，这里愿就新歌剧工作谈谈我们的体会和意见。
      年轻的新歌剧艺术已成长起来，但与人民的要求比较起来却落后了
    新歌剧是“五四”新文化运动以来许多戏剧、音乐工作者共同探索和创造的艺术形式。它很年轻，但它有反映人民现实斗争生活、为革命事业服务的光荣传统。特别是毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表以后，明确了艺术为工农兵服务的方向，正确地解决了普及与提高的关系、继承民族文化遗产和借鉴外来文化经验等问题，因此展开了新秧歌运动，产生了“兄妹开荒”、“白毛女”等作品，新歌剧成长起来了。当时的新歌剧工作者以饱满的政治热情，积极干预生活，深入群众，虚心学习，他们的创作具有强烈的时代气息和阶级感情，成为人民进行解放斗争和自我教育的有力武器。
    全国解放以后，情况有了新的变化。新剧歌面临着提高艺术质量、建立剧场艺术、争取广大观众的任务，以更好地为建设社会主义而服务。几年来在党和政府的领导和扶持下，经过新歌剧工作者的努力取得了不少成绩。在创作方面产生了“赤叶河”、“王贵与李香香”、“星星之火”、“刘胡兰”、“草原之歌”、“一个志愿军的未婚妻”等受观众欢迎的作品，这些作品在许多方面都比过去提高了一步。在学习方面由于有了比较安定的环境，新歌剧工作者的专业技能有了显著的进步，特别是在向民族戏曲遗产和向西洋歌剧学习上取得了很大的成绩（不少新歌剧演员学会了具有高度技巧的民间和古典戏曲节目，有些歌剧团体在短短的时间内也能够演出或排演了像“茶花女”、“被出卖的新嫁娘”、“小牛”这样的外国歌剧）。在演出方面几个专业的新歌剧团体几年来始终努力不懈，在缺少保留剧目和剧场艺术经验的条件下，克服许多困难完成了演出任务。以中央实验歌剧院为例，去年一年中就演出了四百二十一场，观众达到八十四万余人，上座率平均达到98％以上。地方上和部队里的歌剧团、文工团也采取剧场演出、广场演出和巡回演出等方式将新歌剧向群众中普及。这里还值得提出的是我们年轻的新歌剧艺术在国外演出中也受到热烈的欢迎，这不论是由我国艺术团体演出的（如“白毛女”）或由外国歌剧院所排演的（如“王贵与李香香”）节目都得到了外国艺术家们和广大观众的赞扬。
    新歌剧虽然取得了这样一些成绩，但是与我们这样大的国家和人民日益增长的要求比较起来却又远远地落后了，这无论从新歌剧的创作、演出团体和演出的质量或数量方面来看都是如此。特别是在创作上不够活跃，缺少强烈感人的生活气息，表现形式上不够亲切、不够完美，因此观众也常常在这方面给予善意的批评。形成这些缺点的主要原因是：在新歌剧工作者的主观方面还存在着脱离政治、脱离生活的倾向，过去秧歌运动时期火辣辣的战斗作风和密切联系群众的优良传统没有得到更进一步的发扬光大；对于民族戏剧、音乐传统虽然在口头上认为应该继承，但在实际上学习得很不够，在学习过程中存在许多清规戒律；同时，不论是在向民族的和外国的先进艺术学习时也还有教条主义和单纯技术观点的缺点与错误。这些都妨碍了新歌剧更进一步的提高，妨碍了新歌剧更好地与人民相结合。除了新歌剧工作者主观方面的原因以外，过去几年来在客观条件上对于新歌剧的发展也有些不利的情况。如在全国文工团整编和第一次全国戏曲会演以后，对新歌剧团体收缩过大、过猛，又缺少妥善的安排，在工作方针上对于新歌剧与戏曲改革的关系阐述的不十分明确，有些地方甚至将二者混为一谈，这些都对新歌剧的发展产生了消极的影响。当然，新歌剧发展中的问题以及解决问题的方法主要地应该从新歌剧本身的艺术规律、新歌剧与群众的关系这些基本方面去探求，我们作为新歌剧工作者，一定要努力解决我们本身的思想问题和艺术上、技术上存在的问题；同时我们也想借这个机会向领导方面、社会舆论方面、作家们和戏曲界的同志们呼吁，希望大家更多地关心和扶持新歌剧这朵年轻的花朵。
      希望各方面更多地关心和扶持新歌剧，使它在百花争妍中繁荣起来
    首先，在创作方面，希望文学家们更积极地为新歌剧创作剧本，作曲家们更积极地为新歌剧作曲。新歌剧的传统节目不多，目前的新歌剧团体还不能够像戏曲剧团那样地在固定剧场以保留节目作轮换演出，因此必须加强创作、积累剧目。新歌剧过去的创作主要是反映当代生活的重大主题，这是一个好的传统，还应该继承下来，但这不应该是唯一的方面。今天无论在题材方面、体裁和风格方面都应该多样化。神话、传说、历史题材，兄弟民族的、儿童生活的、部队生活的各种题材都可以写并且应该写。在体裁、风格上应该给予作家更大的自由，发挥他们创造的积极性。批评界对于新歌剧的创作应该从现有的水平出发，给予更多的鼓励、支持和实事求是的分析。让新歌剧的创作在百花争妍中、在群众的考验下繁荣起来，丰富起来。
    在新歌剧的事业单位方面应该更主动、更有计划地与作家们联系，具体帮助作家把他们的创作变成舞台实践，对新作品不要一下子要求太高，而是在不断实践和修正中逐渐提高。此外，在组织艺术生产过程中要注意更科学更合理地调配劳动力，贯彻精简节约的精神，尽量作到避免人力和物力的浪费。在演员的训练方面目前还存在严重的问题需要解决。由于新歌剧的历史短，在演员的训练上没有成熟的经验，而且各种不同的团体和各种不同的剧目对演员的要求也不相同，因此新歌剧的演员在声乐、表演、舞蹈等方面的训练上现在莫衷一是，老一些的演员在进一步如何提高上感到困惑，新的演员也常不知从何处入手而感到顾此失彼。这些问题当然都不是一下子就能全部解决了的，但应该提到工作日程上来，研究这方面的问题，加强这方面的工作。
    最近在北京由全国剧协和音协联合召开了新歌剧问题座谈会，参加会议的同志对今天新歌剧发展中存在的问题和今后工作方针广泛地交换了意见并取得了基本上一致的看法。政府领导部门也在重视并加强了这一方面的领导工作，同时也在考虑今后新歌剧团体的具体安排问题。这对新歌剧的发展是一个喜讯。今后更希望得到社会上各界人士的关心，特别希望戏曲界的同志们对新歌剧工作者给予更多的帮助，使得新歌剧工作者能够更好地继承发扬民族遗产，使得新歌剧在中国的肥沃土地上开出更鲜艳的花来。（附图片）
