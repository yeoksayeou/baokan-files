　　“Children's Book Week”
　　Soviet elementary school students are having a pleasant spring break, busy participating in various activities. The traditional Children's Book Week is one of the most attractive events of the spring break. This is a grand review of children's books and a festival for young readers. During this week, new book exhibitions, reader-writer meetings, reader conferences, entertainment evenings, and a series of other activities will be held. Cinemas will also show films adapted from children's favorite works.
　　The Children's Book Week in Moscow opened on March 24 in the Column Hall of the House of Trade Unions. Large-scale children's book exhibitions are held in the halls of the House of Trade Unions, and there are also temporary book stalls. The doors of the Children's Book House and the Young Pioneers' Palace are also open. Here, in addition to book exhibitions, editors of many youth and children's magazines will meet with young readers. During these days, reader-writer meetings will be the most popular program. Writers will read their new works to young readers at the meeting and listen to their opinions. Children are often very strict readers! Some writers not only participate in the Children's Book Week activities in the city, but also go to various districts and to the countryside to visit young readers. Famous children's literature writers such as Musatov and Mikhalkov will participate in the Book Week activities.
　　The activities of Children's Book Week in the Soviet Union are very extensive. For example, it was held in 136 cities last spring, and more places will organize such activities this year. In the Soviet Union, the number of children's books published is very large. Last year, 170 million copies were published, and there are dozens of publishers publishing children's books.

　　“儿童书籍周”
    苏联的小学生们正在渡过愉快的春假，忙着参加各式各样的活动。传统的儿童书籍周是春假中最吸引人的活动之一。这是儿童读物的一次大检阅，也是小读者们的节日。在这一周内，要举办新书展览，读者和作家见面会，读者会，文娱晚会等一系列活动。电影院也要放映根据儿童喜爱的作品摄制的影片。
    莫斯科的儿童书籍周，3月24日在工会大厦圆柱大厅开幕了。工会大厦的各大厅中举办有大规模的儿童读物展览，还设有临时售书亭。儿童书籍之家和少先队员之家的大门也都敞开着。在这里，除书籍展览外，许多青年和少年杂志的编辑，将同小读者们见面。这几天中，读者和作家的见面会，将是最受欢迎的节目。作家们在会上向小读者们朗诵自己的新作品，听取他们的意见。孩子们常常是要求很严格的读者呢！一些作家不仅在城内参加儿童书籍周的活动，而且还到各区里去，到农村的小读者那儿去做客。穆萨托夫和米哈尔科夫等著名儿童文学作家都将参加书籍周的活动。
    苏联举办儿童书籍周的活动是很广泛的。例如，去年春天曾有一百三十六个城市举办过，今年还要有更多的地方要组织这种活动。在苏联，儿童读物的出版数很大，去年就出版有一亿七千万册，出版儿童读物的共有好几十个出版社。  （君）（附图片）
