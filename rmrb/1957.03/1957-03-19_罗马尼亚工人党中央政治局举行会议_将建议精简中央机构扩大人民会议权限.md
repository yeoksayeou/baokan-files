    Xinhua News Agency, March 18th: According to a report by the Romanian News Agency, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party held a meeting on the 14th to discuss measures to improve the work of the central government and issues related to the work of the People's Assembly.
    The meeting communiqué, after discussing the significant role of existing central organizations in the past, stated that considering the experience accumulated to date, the organizational structure of various departments, and the improved level of cadre training in central state organs, the majority of central organizations are no longer suited to current needs. In order to further improve the work of central state organs and eliminate excessive centralization, the Political Bureau believes that measures must be taken to vigorously streamline central organizations, merge relevant central organizations, and reduce government personnel. An economic committee should be established within the government to address current economic problems. At the same time, the powers of various ministries, departments, bureaus, and other central state organs should be greatly expanded to more effectively solve problems in their work, strengthen their initiative and sense of responsibility, and enable the Council of Ministers to focus its activities more on major issues of national policy. The implementation of the above measures must achieve the goal of improving the work of state organs and reducing government expenditure.
    The communiqué stated that in accordance with the resolution of the December 1956 plenary session of the Workers' Party Central Committee, a bill on the People's Assembly will be submitted to the National Assembly. This bill will expand the powers and scope of activities of the People's Assembly, thereby increasing the initiative and sense of responsibility of local organs of power in solving economic, administrative, municipal, and socio-cultural issues.

    罗马尼亚工人党中央政治局举行会议
    将建议精简中央机构扩大人民会议权限
    新华社18日讯　据罗马尼亚通讯社报道：罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会政治局14日举行会议，讨论改进中央政府的工作的措施和有关人民会议工作的问题。
    会议公报谈到现有中央机构过去的巨大作用后说，考虑到迄今所积累的经验、各部门的组织状况和中央国家机关培养干部水平的提高，大部分中央机构已经不再适合当前的需要。为了进一步改善中央国家机关的工作和消除过分集中的现象，政治局认为必须采取措施大力精简中央机构，合并有关的中央机构，精简政府人员。政府内部应成立一个经济委员会以解决当前的经济问题。同时要大大扩大各部、司、局和其他中央国家机关的权限，以便更加有效地解决工作中的问题，加强它们的主动性和责任感，使部长会议有更大的可能性把自己的活动集中在国家政策的主要问题上。采取上述各项措施，必须达到改进国家机关工作和减少政府开支的目的。
    公报说，根据工人党中央1956年12月全会的决议，将要向国民议会提出一个关于人民会议的法案。这个法案将扩大人民会议的权限和活动范围，从而增加地方政权机关在解决经济、行政、市政和社会文化问题时的主动性和责任感。
