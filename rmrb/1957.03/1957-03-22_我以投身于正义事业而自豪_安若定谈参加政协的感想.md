　　I fully endorse Chairman Mao's speech and Premier Zhou's report, and I agree with the special reports of Vice Premiers Chen Yun and Li Fuchun, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and other leading comrades.
　　Standing before all of you advanced comrades, I am but a primary school student. Now, with a learning attitude, I would like to share some of my understanding, experiences, and opinions on the construction of our motherland, as well as some of the processes of my own ideological development.
　　In the seven years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, thanks to the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, the efforts of the people and all democratic parties across the country, and the assistance of the Soviet Union and brotherly countries, we have thoroughly completed China's bourgeois democratic revolution and basically completed China's socialist revolution. The outstanding achievement of the First Five-Year Plan is the fundamental completion of the historical task of changing ownership. Moreover, this was a peaceful transformation, a broad mass socialist revolutionary movement, truly as Vice Premier Li pointed out, "Unprecedented in world history in terms of breadth, speed, depth, and stability." Not only have people from all walks of life in China embarked on the broad road of socialism, but it has also proven Lenin's principle that the path to socialism "will have its own characteristics in each nation." It has set a brilliant example for the world communist movement, especially for the brotherly countries of Asia.
　　Now, the draft of the Second Five-Year Plan has been proposed and is under review. In response to the characteristics of China's economic situation and the requirements for proportionate development, it points out the path of China's industrialization, overall consideration and appropriate arrangements, as well as the implementation of the policy of increasing production and practicing economy, and building the country through diligence and thrift. This is a completely necessary and correct plan. It is foreseeable that upon the completion of the Second Five-Year Plan, some of the difficulties currently being felt will become relics of the past, and the country will show another new atmosphere and face. Our beloved motherland is moving forward rapidly, without pause. We are fortunate to have caught up with this era! Our government is a government with grand vision, practical style, unprecedented unity in history, the most capable leadership, and the most efficient work. In particular, it is a government with ideals, principles, plans, and principles, and at the same time, it comes from the masses, goes to the masses, and is wholeheartedly willing to do more "beneficial things" for the people and listen to the people's criticisms. Our country is one of the pillars supporting the world peace camp, a country with high prestige in the world.
　　Seven years ago, our motherland was still riddled with sores. Twelve years ago, the people suffered from deep water and scorching fire, displacement, and almost faced the misfortune of national subjugation. Our happiness and glory today are the result of the Communist Party of China's leadership and struggle. "Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China." This is an irrefutable truth. Therefore, as a member of the Chinese people, I should first express my highest respect and heartfelt gratitude to the Communist Party of China, headed by Chairman Mao Zedong!
　　Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long's visit abroad this time lasted nearly eighty days, covering more than 54,000 kilometers, spanning Europe and Asia, and visiting eleven countries. This was an unprecedented initiative in history. They were warmly and grandly welcomed by government leaders and the masses in every place they visited. They issued many joint communiqués, joint statements, speeches, and addresses, achieving unparalleled and remarkable accomplishments, and bringing back friendship, knowledge, and peace. This has created favorable foreign conditions to help us carry out the Second Five-Year Plan. As everyone knows, our Premier is a first-class genius activist on the world political stage. At the same time, he is an outstanding and great statesman. His diligence and achievements are worthy of our admiration and respect. His genius activities have achieved extraordinary success in international affairs more than once in the past, writing many glorious pages. This is inseparable from the leadership and decision-making of the Party Central Committee and the government, headed by the great and wise Chairman Mao Zedong, and it is inseparable from the great achievements of the working people of the motherland in building the country.
　　We also see that the victory of agricultural cooperativization across the country has laid the foundation for the worker-peasant alliance; the slogan of marching towards science, especially the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, has powerfully promoted the enthusiasm of intellectuals; the proposal of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision has also strengthened the sense of responsibility of democratic parties and non-party democratic figures as masters of their own affairs; the domestic united front has also become more extensive and comprehensive, and all forces that can be united will be united. Not only have we united representative progressives and the broad masses of people from all walks of life at home and abroad, including overseas Chinese and more than sixty ethnic minorities, but we have also issued a call to the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan, who are in a state of hostility, giving them the opportunity to revolt and perform meritorious service and to achieve peaceful liberation. All of this demonstrates the selflessness of the Chinese working class and the sincere desire of the people of the whole country to enter socialist society together.
　　The "Li Ji Li Yun" chapter says, "The sage regards the world as one family and China as one person." The Communist Party of China has this ideal, this courage, and this plan and practical ability. It is only natural to enjoy the glorious title of a Communist Party member. We cannot believe that everyone among the more than ten million Communist Party members has the same level, but I firmly believe that under the leadership and education of the Party Central Committee, headed by leaders such as Mao, Liu, Zhou, Zhu, Chen, and Dong, we can happily and competently lead the people of the whole country to complete their great historical mission. This is beyond doubt.
　　At present, in the socialist revolution, including a series of ideological transformation movements and counter-revolutionary campaigns, under the general situation of "breadth, speed, depth, and stability," some contradictions between the Party and non-Party relations have also been discovered. I think this is a necessary transitional phenomenon during the transition between the old and new societies, and it is not surprising. With the same application of "breadth, speed, depth, and stability," with the necessary arrangements and appropriate handling, it can be gradually improved, and some contradictions can be resolved. Moreover, there have been many cases that have already been dealt with and achieved good results.
　　Our beloved Premier said earlier: Different opinions can promote progress. At the same time, contradictions can be discovered at any time, and the initiative to resolve contradictions can be grasped in a timely manner, without falling into a passive state when problems occur. Therefore, I believe that strengthening the unified front under leadership, first listening to the people's opinions, and the basic principle of following the mass line are completely correct. In addition, when we democratic figures listen to and reflect opinions, we should not listen to hearsay or take everything in indiscriminately, but we should add a certain amount of analysis and criticism.
　　I was honored to participate in the enlarged meetings of the Supreme State Conference twice with my comrades, and I heard Chairman Mao's important speech on correctly handling contradictions among the people. He opposed dogmatism and revisionism at the same time. Chairman Mao instructed that everything has duality, good contains bad, and bad contains good, fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds are relative and can be transformed. At the same time, he also pointed out that whether you are right or wrong, you can learn from experience as a lesson. This is my understanding of taking things out of context, which may be wrong, but I personally feel that such an in-depth and easy-to-understand, persuasive, and scientific correct instruction has greatly enlightened me and can help correct our one-sidedness and subjectivity in looking at problems.
　　At the same time, I further realize the greatness of the Communist Party of China, putting doing a good job first, and everything is "to deal with the matter, not the person." Starting from the desire for unity, through criticism and struggle, a new unity is achieved on a new basis. The purpose is to do a good job. If this formula can be firmly grasped from top to bottom, then there will be no confrontational contradictions. All problems can be solved through mutual criticism, or some minor details need not be overly concerned about. This has nothing in common with the expulsion and entrapment of the old society, "loving someone to the point of wanting them to live, and hating someone to the point of wanting them to die," and being polite and perfunctory. This "unity-struggle-unity" formula did not exist in the Wang Ming line era. Therefore, this is not punishmentism, but is to cure the disease and save the person and do a good job, mainly to complete our common cause of building socialism.
　　Chairman Mao wisely instructed: contradictions among the people are not a matter of enemy versus friend, but a matter of right and wrong. The Communist Party of China has thirty years of revolutionary experience, and at the same time absorbs all the experiences of advanced parties, whether correct or wrong. Therefore, the Communist Party of China is a mature party. Reactionaries have always spread rumors or ordinary people have dogmatic ideas, regarding it as a replica of the Soviet party, which is not in line with the facts. The Soviet comrades see this most clearly. The resolution of the 20th Congress pointed out: "The socialist construction forms of the People's Republic of China have many unique characteristics." Of course, we should not be satisfied with ourselves, and errors cannot be avoided. "Any counter-revolutionaries must be suppressed, and any mistakes must be corrected." This is another wise instruction from Chairman Mao. Our cause is still constantly discovering and correcting mistakes in the course of progress.
　　I was specially invited to be a member of the CPPCC this time, and I thank the people for giving me glory and trust. However, under the leadership of the Party, I have been working for seven years, and I have participated in any meetings of the State Council, read confidential documents, and given me the opportunity to participate in certain important professional regulations work and inspections outside. The people have long given me a high degree of trust and glory. Although I am participating in the CPPCC conference for the first time, I feel exceptionally cordial and very happy among all of you advanced comrades, just like a member of a large family. In particular, listening to everyone's speeches has given me more knowledge and greatly educated me. What is even more glorious and encouraging to me than myself are my friends and comrades. Yesterday, I also received a letter from an old comrade "after twenty years of separation" through the CPPCC. He saw my name in the Jiangsu Xinhua Daily and "danced with joy and cheered three times" for me.
　　In the past, I was a follower of Sun Yat-sen. Seeing the hopelessness of the Kuomintang's politics, and following the evolution of the times, I and my comrades established the Chinese Young Labor Party. I also fantasized about becoming a bridge between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and further becoming a bridge between the Soviet Union and the United States. However, due to Chiang Kai-shek's stubbornness and the greed and shamelessness of the four major families, we responded to Chairman Mao's May 1st call and leaned towards the people's revolutionary cause. This was not accidental. As early as 1932, when we were in Nanjing, we started the predecessor of the Party, the Chinese Casting Soul Society, and issued the call to "promote the spirit of the great chivalrous soul and resist Japan and save the country." Until the year before the national liberation in Shanghai, many people told me how the Communist Party was and advised me on what to do. We believe that the great chivalrous soul is the pursuit of the truth of the doctrine, and at the same time, it is a sense of justice. Thousands of historical examples prove that truth and justice will not be destroyed forever. People live in the air, but they cannot see the air; people live in the truth, but they cannot see the truth. Even so, air exists, and truth exists. To follow it is to survive, and to go against it is to perish. Long ago, I praised Lenin and Sun Yat-sen as great chivalrous souls, because they loved the truth and dedicated themselves to the cause of justice. We saw some of Stalin's practices in the Soviet Union for a period of time and did not agree with them, but we eventually recognized that communism is the cause of justice for mankind. Similarly, when there was a military blockade in China, and there were limitations in understanding new things, but after the War of Resistance against Japan reached Chongqing, a telegram was sent to welcome Chairman Mao to Chongqing, calling him "a great personality" and "having political foresight," which "truly comforted the people's hopes." It was because I read the "Yan'an Rectification Documents" and the pamphlet that proposed the "Sinicization of Marxism" theory, because of the resonance of truth and justice. I believe that this basic spirit of human love for truth and sense of justice will last forever, and every upright person will bow to the truth and justice.
　　Today, the cause led by the Communist Party of China is a just cause, and the Marxism we study is scientific truth. I am proud and honored that myself, my friends, and my comrades are dedicated to the life of truth and dedicated to the cause of justice.
　　"Make friends with all the good people in the world, and read all the wonderful books in the world." This is my lifelong requirement of myself. Today's wonderful books are Marxism and dialectics. Good friends are the workers, peasants, and working intellectuals.
　　Finally, I especially agree with Committee Member Zhao Puchu's emphasis on "the affairs of the spiritual world," "there are many active factors, and there are many useful sharp edges," "which should be mobilized to serve the construction of the motherland." "Ignoring the affairs of the spiritual world" easily breeds base localism and selfish utilitarianism, which will bring harm to the revolutionary cause.
　　Therefore, proposing to study classical literature more, critically accept China's inherent cultural heritage, and earnestly protect freedom of religious belief and freedom of school formation should be one of the central contents of the components of letting a hundred flowers bloom. Because they can assist and strengthen the fighting strength of our people's cause.
　　I want to cheer for the People's Republic of China. I want to celebrate the complete victory of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle in China for more than a hundred years. I want to express my gratitude to the Communist Party of China, which leads us to the life of truth, to the cause of justice, and to one victory after another. I personally should do my best to connect with the masses and lean towards the people's government in the cause of the people's ocean, to make up for the losses of my many years of fighting alone and taking detours. I want to shout: Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao Zedong! Long live the People's Republic of China! (Attached picture)

### 我以投身于正义事业而自豪　安若定谈参加政协的感想

　　我以投身于正义事业而自豪
　　安若定谈参加政协的感想
    我完全拥护毛主席的讲话、周总理的报告，并同意陈云、李富春两副总理、陈叔通副主席和各位首长的专题报告。
    我在诸位先进前面，算是小学生，现在本着学习态度，想谈谈对祖国建设的若干认识体会意见和本人思想发展的某些过程。
    中华人民共和国建国七年来，由于中国共产党的正确领导，全国人民和各民主党派的努力，加上苏联和兄弟国家的帮助，我们已经彻底完成了中国的资产阶级民主革命，又基本上完成了中国的社会主义革命。第一个五年计划突出的成绩是基本上完成了改变所有制的历史任务，而且这是一个和平转变的广大群众的社会主义革命运动，真如李副总理指出的“运动之广、速、深和稳，是在世界历史上未有的。”不但中国各阶层人民从此走入社会主义的大道，而且是证明了列宁的走到社会主义的形式“每个民族都会有自己的特点”这个原理；对世界共产主义运动特别是亚洲的兄弟国家作出了一个辉煌的范例。
    现在第二个五年计划草案已经提出，又在开始审查中。针对我国经济情况的特点和有比例发展的要求，指出我国工业化的道路，统筹兼顾和适当安排，以及贯彻执行增产节约、勤俭建国的方针，这是完全必要的正确的方案。可以预想，第二个五年计划完成，目前所感受到的某些困难都将变为陈迹，国家更将显出另一种新的气象和面貌。可爱的祖国正在一刻不停地快步前进中。我们赶上这个时代是幸福的！我们的政府是气魄宏伟、作风踏实、历史上空前团结最有领导能力和工作效率的政府，特别是有理想、有主义、有原则、有计划，同时是从群众中来、到群众中去、全心全意真正肯为人民多做“有益的事情”并且听取人民批评意见的政府。我国是世界和平阵营力量支持的柱石之一，是一个拥有世界上高度威信的国家。
    七年以前，我们的祖国还是满身疮痍的。十二年以前，人民受到水深火热、离乡背土的灾难，几乎走上了亡国的厄运。我们今天的幸福与光辉，是由于中国共产党领导奋斗的结果。“没有共产党，就没有新中国”，这是一条颠扑不破的真理。因此，作为中国人民的一分子，我应该首先向以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党表示崇高的敬意、由衷的感谢！
    这次周恩来总理、贺龙副总理出国访问，为期将八十天，行程五万四千多公里，地跨欧亚两大洲，走遍了十一个国家，在历史上是空前的创举。到处受着各国政府领袖和群众热烈的盛大欢迎。发表了不少次数的联合公报、联合声明、讲话和演说，获得无比卓越的成就，载回了友谊、知识与和平。这对帮助我们进行第二个五年计划创造了国外良好条件。众所周知，我们的总理是世界政治舞台上第一流天才活动家。同时是一位杰出的伟大政治家。他的勤劳和成就，值得我们感佩与崇敬。他天才的活动在过去国际事务中不止一次地得到非常的成就，写下不少辉煌的史页，这是与伟大英明的毛泽东主席为首的党中央和政府的领导与决策分不开的，是与祖国劳动人民努力建设国家的伟大成就分不开的。
    我们再看到：全国农业合作化的胜利，奠定了工农联盟的基础；向科学进军的口号特别是百花齐放、百家争鸣的政策，已经有力地推动了知识分子的积极性；长期共存、互相监督的提出，也已加强了各民主党派和无党派民主人士的主人责任感；国内统一战线也更广泛与全面了，一切可以团结的力量都将团结起来。不但团结了国内外的有代表性的各阶层进步人士和广大人民包括华侨和六十多种少数民族，而且还早向敌对状态的台湾国民党军政人员发出号召，给以起义立功与和平解放的机会；——这一切的一切，都是说明了中国工人阶级的大公无私和全国人民一道进入社会主义社会的真诚愿望。
    礼记礼运篇说，“圣人耐以天下为一家，以中国为一人”。中国共产党有此理想，也有此魄力，同时更有此计划与实践能力。作为一个共产党员享受光荣的称号，是理所当然的。我们不能相信在一千多万共产党员中个个有同样的水平，但我确实深信在以毛、刘、周、朱、陈、董几位领袖人物为首的党中央领导和教育之下，可以愉快胜任地带同全国人民完成他们伟大的历史任务的。这是不容怀疑的。
    目前，在社会主义革命包括一系列思想改造运动和肃反运动在“广、速、深、稳”总的情况下，也发现了党与非党关系的某些矛盾问题。我想，这是新旧社会交替之际必然的过渡现象，是无足奇怪的，随着时间的同样运用“广、速、深、稳”的必要安排，作出适当的处理，是可以逐步好转的，某些矛盾是可以解除的。而且已有不少事例早经进行处理得到良好的效果。
    我们敬爱的总理早前说过：不同的意见，可以推动进步。同时，可以随时发现矛盾，及时地掌握解除矛盾的主动性。不会因到了问题发生而陷于被动状态。因此，我认为加强有领导的统一战线，首先多听人民反映意见，走群众路线的基本原则是完全正确的。另外，我们民主人士在听取、反映之间，不是道听途闻或者一揽子包下，而是要加以一定的分析、批判的。
    我荣幸地和同志们一道，两次参加了最高国务会议扩大会议，听到了主席关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾的重要讲话。他反对教条主义，同时反对修正主义。主席指示：任何事物都有二重性，好的里面有坏，坏的里面有好，香花和毒草是相对的，可以转化的。同时又指出，正了错了，都可以吸取经验作为教训。这是我断章取义的了解，可能有错误，但我个人体会到这样深入浅出、富于说服力的科学性的正确指示，大大启发了我，可以帮助纠正了我们看问题的片面性、主观性。
    同时我再体会到中国共产党的伟大，把做好工作放在第一位，一切是“对事不对人”。从团结愿望出发，通过批评和斗争，在新的基础上达到新的团结。目的为了做好工作。这个公式如果自上而下都能牢牢地掌握住，那引起对抗性的矛盾就不会有。一切问题就不难从互相批评中获得解决，或者某些枝节不必过于计较的。这是与旧社会“爱之欲其生、恶之欲其死”的排挤倾陷、客气用事是没有共同之处的。这个“团结——斗争——团结”公式，在王明路线时代是没有的。因此，这也不是惩办主义，而是为了治病救人做好工作，主要为了完成我们建设社会主义的共同事业。
    主席英明指示：人民内部矛盾，不是敌我问题，而为是非问题。中国共产党有三十年革命的经验，同时吸取先进党不论正确的、错误的一切经验，因此，中国共产党是成熟的党。反动分子一贯造谣或者一般人有教条主义的想法，把它看成是苏联党的翻版，这是不符合事实的。在这点上苏联同志看得最清楚。第二十次代表大会决议中这样指出：“中华人民共和国的社会主义建设形式有着许多独特点。”当然，我们不该自己满足，错误不能避免，“有反必肃，有错必纠”，这是主席的又一英明指示。我们的事业在前进中还在不断地发现错误、修正错误。
    我这次被特邀为政协委员，感谢人民给我以光荣和信任。但我在党的领导下，已经工作七年了，在国务院任何会议都曾参与，机要文件都曾阅读，某些业务重要法规工作和出外视察都曾给我参加机会，人民早已给了我高度信任和光荣。虽然初次参加政协大会，在诸位先进前面，就像在大家庭中成员一样，感觉到异常亲切，愉快非常。特别是听到各位发言，使我得到更多的知识，受到极大的教育。还有比我更引为光荣和鼓舞的是我的朋友们、同志们。昨天我还由政协转来“一别二十年”的老同志的来信，他从江苏新华日报看到我的名字，为我“雀跃三、欢呼三”。
    我过去是孙中山信徒，看着国民党政治的无望，跟着时代演进，和同志们成立了中国少年劳动党。还幻想作出国共两党的桥梁，进一步作出苏美两个世界的桥梁。但由于蒋介石的顽梗不化，四大家族的贪婪无耻，我们响应了毛主席五一文告号召，靠拢人民革命事业。这并不是偶然的。当1932年正当我们在南京开始党的前身中国铸魂学社发出“发扬大侠魂精神抗日救亡”的号召，一直到全国解放的前一年在上海，不少人向我进言：共产党如何如何，劝我如何如何。我们认为大侠魂就是追求真理的主义，同时是一个正义感。历史上万千事例证明：真理和正义是不会永远被灭亡的。人活在空气中，见不到空气；人活在真理中，见不到真理。虽然如此，空气是存在的，真理是存在的，顺之则存，逆之则亡。很早以前，我就赞颂列宁、孙中山是大侠魂者，理由是他们爱好真理，投身于正义事业。我们有一时期看到苏联斯大林的某些作法，不以为然，但终究承认共产主义是人类的正义事业。同样，当国内军事封锁，对新的事物了解有局限性；但抗战到了重庆以后，发出欢迎毛主席莅渝代电，称他“人格伟大”、“有政治远见”、“实慰人民之望”，就因读到延安“整风文献”和提出“马克思主义中国化”论点的小册子，由于真理与正义的声应气求。我相信人类的真理爱好与正义感这种基本精神是会万古长存的，每一个正直的人都会向着真理和正义低头的。
    今天，中国共产党领导我们的事业是正义事业，学习的马克思主义是科学的真理。我感到自己和朋友们、同志们投身于真理生活中、投身于正义事业中感到骄傲，引以自豪。
    “交尽天下良友，读尽人间奇书”，这是我平生对于自己的要求。今天的奇书，就是马克思主义、辩证法。良友，就是工农群众和劳动的知识分子。
    最后，我特别同意赵朴初委员重视“精神世界的事”，“有许许多多的积极因素，有许许多多的有用的力刃”，“应当动员起来为祖国建设服务”的发言。“忽视精神世界的事”容易滋长卑鄙的本位主义与自私的功利主义，将带来对革命事业的损害。
    因此，提出多多研究古典文学，批判接受中国固有文化遗产，以及切实保护宗教信仰自由和学派形成自由，应该是百花齐放的组成部分的中心内容之一。因为它们可以辅助和加强我们人民事业的战斗力量。
    我要为中华人民共和国而欢呼。要为中国百多年来反帝反封建的斗争胜利全盘翻身而庆祝。要为领导我们走向真理生活、走向正义事业、一个胜利接着一个胜利的中国共产党表示感谢。我个人更该在人民大海的事业中联系群众靠拢人民政府尽我点滴的力量，弥补我多年来孤军奋斗和走尽弯路的损失。我要高呼：中国共产党万岁！毛泽东主席万岁！中华人民共和国万岁！（附图片）
