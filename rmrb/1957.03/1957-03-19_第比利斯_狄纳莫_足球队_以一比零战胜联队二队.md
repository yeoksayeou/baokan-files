        Tbilisi "Dinamo" Football Team
        Defeats Combined Team Two 1-0
        (Our Newspaper) The Tbilisi "Dinamo" football team from the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, USSR, which was passing through our country on its way home from Burma, played a friendly match against China's Combined Team Two at the Xian Nong Tan Stadium in Beijing yesterday afternoon. As a result of the match, "Dinamo" won 1-0.
        The decisive goal was scored eight minutes before the end of the match. When left forward Iamanidze received a high ball from the midfielder, he jumped up and headed the ball into the penalty area, and right winger Khasaya rushed up and shot hard, breaking the deadlock between the two sides.
        The "Dinamo" team's characteristic throughout the match was that the forwards charged bravely, passed quickly and cleanly, and dribbled the ball very beautifully. In terms of tactics, they adopted a novel three-midfielder, four-forward formation, which effectively controlled the midfield and created continuous attacking opportunities for the forwards. What impressed the audience most was that when taking corner kicks, they did not lob the ball into the center for the forwards, but cleverly and unexpectedly lobbed the ball lightly backwards, allowing the defenders to rush up quickly and shoot hard.
        Yesterday, Combined Team Two's defense was excellent, repeatedly blocking the visiting team's attacks. The mutual cover of the three defenders made it difficult for the opposing forwards to find gaps in the penalty area, and goalkeeper Huang Zhaowen also saved several dangerous shots. However, the forwards' attacking ability was very poor, and they rarely charged into the opponent's penalty area. Often, as soon as the ball reached the penalty area, it was intercepted by the opponent's defenders. Throughout the match, apart from a beautiful bicycle kick by left forward Sun Fucheng from 20 meters out in the second half, they hardly threatened the goal once.
        After watching the game, "Dinamo" team's head coach, Chechelava, told reporters: "I saw the Chinese team play in Moscow a year ago, and now the Chinese team's technique has improved a lot compared to the past, especially the defenders. Their cover is good, their passing is accurate, and they are good at controlling the midfield; if the forwards can be more aggressive in the penalty area and have more attacking methods, they will definitely be able to score goals."

    第比利斯“狄纳莫”足球队
    以一比零战胜联队二队
    本报讯　从缅甸归国路过我国的苏联格鲁吉亚共和国第比利斯 “狄纳莫”足球队，昨日下午在北京先农坛体育场对我国联队二队进行了一场友谊比赛。比赛结果，“狄纳莫”队以一比零获胜。
    这关键性的一球是在终场前八分钟踢入的。当左锋依阿马尼杰在得到前卫传来的高球时，跃起将球顶往禁区内，右翼哈萨亚飞步赶上劲射，打破了双方相持不下的僵局。
    “狄纳莫”队在整场比赛中的特色是前锋冲刺勇猛，传球快而利落，带球过人的动作十分漂亮。在战术上，他们采用了新颖的三前卫、四前锋的踢法，有利地控制了中场球，为前锋造成连续进攻的机会。给观众印象最深的是，他们在发角球的时候，并不将球吊中交给前锋，而是巧妙地、出其不意地将球轻轻往后一吊，由后卫飞快赶上劲射。
    昨日联队二队的防守很出色，多次阻挡了客队的进攻。三个后卫的互相补位，使对方前锋在禁区内很难找到空隙，守门员黄肇文也救出了好几个险球。但是前锋进攻能力却很差，很少向对方禁区内进行冲刺，往往球一到禁区便被对方后卫截去。在全场比赛中，除了下半时左锋孙福成在二十公尺处作了一个漂亮的凌空倒钩射门外，几乎没有叩过一次门。
    “狄纳莫”队的主任教练捷捷拉瓦在看完比赛后对记者说：“一年前我看过中国队在莫斯科的比赛，现在中国队的技术已比过去提高了很多，尤其是后卫。他们的补位好，出球准，也善于控制中场球；要是前锋在禁区内能更积极一些，进攻的办法再多一些，那一定可以射进球。”
