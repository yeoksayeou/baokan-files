　　So Generous
    After the Bermuda Conference, British Prime Minister Macmillan loudly proclaimed the "success" of the talks at a press conference, and particularly emphasized that the arrangement of the United States supplying missiles to Britain "is of very important significance." Then the Prime Minister explained in a tone that seemed very satisfied that this would allow Britain to free up some forces to research and develop "other valuable defense plans," and therefore "this is a more intelligent approach."
    However, the Prime Minister's sense of satisfaction did not arouse the same relief among British bourgeois figures. On the contrary, some people couldn't help but reveal serious concerns. Richard Crossman, a member of the British House of Commons, expressed in an article published in the "Daily Mirror" that Macmillan's acceptance of American missiles "actually amounts to surrendering Britain's strategic independence."
    In order to obtain missiles, and pay such a price, Macmillan can truly be said to have made a "burn the boats" determination here.
    If the American missiles were truly genuine, and thus indeed added luster to the atomic "deterrent" power that some people in Britain are obsessed with, then the Prime Minister's mood would still be understandable. But, unfortunately for Britain, the American missiles are useless "silver-plated spears." U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, after returning to Washington from Bermuda, also exposed this comedy with cold words at a press conference. He said: "These missiles cannot actually take off yet," so it is not possible to "absolutely certainly predict when they will be provided." Many American and British news agency reporters further reported that these missiles will not be mass-produced until four years later. Even so, the U.S. President also stipulated that the atomic warheads installed on these missiles "are always owned by us (i.e., the United States)."
    It seems that the British Prime Minister's yearning for missiles has so far been nothing more than a disturbing daydream. In this matter, the Prime Minister's old friends Eisenhower and Dulles are truly cunning to the extreme. In the Bermuda conference communiqué, they made a very generous gesture in a dignified manner: "The United States will provide certain missiles for use by the British armed forces"; but, in reality, what they took out was nothing more than a long-term check that may not be cashed. However, it is this check that may not be cashed that has caused Britain to surrender its "strategic independence," as Crossman said.
    This is America's "generosity" towards its allies; and the British Prime Minister, who considers himself "smart," has obviously miscalculated.

### 如此慷慨

　　如此慷慨
    百慕大会谈结束之后，英国首相麦克米伦在一次记者招待会上大事宣扬会谈的“成功”，并且特别强调指出美国供给英国以导弹的安排“具有非常重要的意义”。接着首相以一种似乎非常心满意得的口气解释说，这样就可以使英国腾出一部分力量来研究和发展“其它有价值的防务计划”，因而“这是比较聪明的做法”。
    但是，首相的得意心情不但没有在英国资产阶级人士中引起同样的欣慰，相反的，有些人却情不自禁地流露了严重的忧虑。英国下院议员理查德·克罗斯曼在“每日镜报”发表的文章中就表示：麦克米伦接受美国的导弹，“实际上是出让了英国的战略独立”。
    为了获得导弹，而付出如此的代价，麦克米伦在这里真可说是下了“破釜沉舟”的决心了。
    如果美国的导弹果真是货真价实，从而的确对英国某些人所迷醉的原子“威慑”力量有所增光，那么，首相的心情也还是可以理解的。但是，对于英国说来不幸的是，美国的导弹却是不中用的“银样蜡枪头”。美国国务卿杜勒斯在从百慕大回到华盛顿之后，也是在一次记者招待会上以冷冰冰的语言揭穿了这幕喜剧。他说：“这些导弹实际上还不能起飞”，所以还不能“绝对肯定地预料在什么时候把它们提供出来”。许多美英通讯社的记者更报道说，这些导弹要在四年之后才能大量生产。即使如此，美国总统还规定了一条，即安装在这些导弹上的原子弹头，“始终是为我们（即美国）所有”。
    看来，英国首相对导弹的向往，到现在为止还不过是一场扰人的春梦。在这件事情上，首相的老朋友艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯，真是狡猾到家了。在百慕大的会谈公报上，他们堂堂皇皇地做出了十分慷慨的姿态：“美国将提供某些导弹，供英国军队使用”；但是，实际上，他们拿出去的不过是一张远期的、未必能够兑现的支票而已。然而，就是这张未必兑现的支票，却使英国如克罗斯曼所说的出让了它的“战略独立”。
    这就是美国对它的盟友的“慷慨”；而自以为“聪明”的英国首相显然是失算了。
