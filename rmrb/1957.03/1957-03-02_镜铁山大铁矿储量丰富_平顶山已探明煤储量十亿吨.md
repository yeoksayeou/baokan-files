    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, March 1st: To date, the only large iron mine in the Northwest that has been initially confirmed through exploration is the Jingtieshan Iron Mine. Lu Renhuai, the captain of the Jingtieshan exploration team who recently arrived in Lanzhou, said that they have mastered enough reserves to build a modern steel plant, and the iron grade meets national requirements.
    This iron mine is located in the mineral-rich Qilian Mountains. Because there is a lot of specularite there, the explorers called it Jingtieshan (Mirror Iron Mountain). In the autumn of 1955, a geological survey team discovered iron ore bodies in that area. Large-scale exploration began in the spring of 1956. At the same time, geological personnel conducted peripheral surveys in an area of ​​3,000 square kilometers and successively discovered more than a dozen iron ore bodies. So far, several of these iron ore bodies have been subjected to trenching, shallow well exploration, as well as physical exploration and drilling.
    This year, the explorers will continue to carry out detailed exploration on the main ore body of Jingtieshan, and some ore bodies will undergo preliminary exploration. Last year, they discovered various metallurgical auxiliary raw materials in the periphery, and this year they will continue to investigate.
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, March 1st: On the evening of February 14th, the workers of drilling rig No. 5 of the 401 Exploration Team of the Ministry of Geology completed the last drilling. So far, the 401 Exploration Team has proven 1 billion tons of coal reserves for the country in the Pingdingshan mining area, successfully completing the exploration task in this mining area.
    The 401 Exploration Team came to Pingdingshan in September 1953. In more than three years, the drilling team members have traveled all over the mountainous areas of more than 80 square kilometers, drilling more than 200 boreholes, with a total footage of more than 50,000 meters. They have preliminarily explored the distribution and reserves of coal types such as fat coal, lean coal, and prime coking coal in Pingdingshan, Longshanmiao, Haotang, Mapengshan and other places, and promptly handed over reliable data for mining to the country.
    Now, the geological and technical personnel in this area are compiling a detailed report on the exploration of the Pingdingshan mining area.

    镜铁山大铁矿储量丰富
    平顶山已探明煤储量十亿吨
    据新华社兰州1日电  到目前为止，经过勘探初步肯定的西北唯一的大铁矿是镜铁山铁矿。最近到达兰州的镜铁山勘探队队长卢仁槐说，他们已经掌握了足够建设一座现代化钢铁厂的储量，铁的品位合乎国家的要求。
    这座铁矿在矿藏丰富的祁连山里面，因为那里多是镜铁，所以勘探人员把它叫做镜铁山。1955年秋天地质普查队在那一带发现了铁矿体，1956年春即开始大规模勘探，同时地质人员在三千平方公里的范围内进行外围普查，先后共发现十几个铁矿体。到现在为止，这些铁矿体中已经有几个进行过槽探、浅井探，以及物理勘探和钻探。
    今年勘探人员将在镜铁山的主要矿体上继续进行详细勘探，有些矿体进行初步勘探。去年他们在外围发现了各种冶金辅助原料，今年也要继续调查。
    据新华社郑州1日电  2月14日晚上，地质部四零一勘探队五号钻机的工人打完了最后一个钻眼。至此，四零一勘探队在平顶山矿区为国家探明煤储量十亿吨，胜利地完成了这个矿区的勘探任务。
    四零一勘探队是1953年9月来到平顶山的。在三年多的时间内，钻探队员们踏遍了八十多平方公里的山野，共打二百多个钻眼，总计进尺五万多公尺。他们先后在平顶山、龙山庙、郝堂、马棚山等地，初步探明了肥煤、瘦煤和主焦煤等煤种的分布和储量情况，及时地向国家交出了开采的可靠资料。
    现在，这个地区的地质技术人员，正在编写平顶山矿区的勘探详细资料报告。
