    An Ordinary Soviet Woman
    By Fang Shi, Chinese Student in the Soviet Union
    Since transferring schools, I haven't been able to see my beloved Elena Shakovich as often. But her image often appears in my memory.

    Elena Shakovich is 55 years old this year. Of course, that's not too old, but the hard and difficult early years of her life have left their mark on her. Her hair is already gray, and her appearance makes her seem older than she is. Now, she is the head of a night university at a teacher's college in Leningrad. In addition to administrative work, she also teaches classes and is a member of the school's Party committee. Whenever I went to her office to find her, I always saw her surrounded by people: teachers who came to discuss curriculum issues with her, students who came to seek advice on their future work, and people like me who came to ask her for guidance on Party work. She was always busy, writing, talking, often suddenly laughing loudly, laughing until she coughed. She is an optimistic, capable, and busy old lady, but who would have thought that she had suffered such great misfortune in her life—her husband and only beloved son were sacrificed in the Great Patriotic War, and now she is the only member of her family.

    Elena Shakovich is very sincere in her treatment of others, and her care for Chinese students is even more meticulous. As soon as she sees that our complexion is not good, she gets angry and says, "If you come to see me with a pale face again, I will definitely send you back." Then she asks endlessly about our "health and daily life." When we hold study discussion meetings or self-criticism meetings, she occasionally participates and puts forward many valuable opinions. Once, someone among us criticized his arrogance, and after hearing this, she said very seriously, "I hear that many responsible comrades in your Party still often take time to listen to philosophy lectures. How humble they are! Can you be satisfied with a little achievement and not study?" She also often praised our academic achievements and encouraged everyone to study hard.

    Last year, on the occasion of Lenin's birthday, we asked her to talk about her meeting with Lenin and asked her to talk about her personal life story.

    "If there had been no revolution, I might have become a vagrant long ago and died from unbearable labor. My mother and sister died young like that." She began her talk about herself in this way.

    She is Belarusian. Her father was a tenant farmer, and her mother was also a servant, who died early. At the age of seven, she was forced by life to become a shepherdess. At the age of nine, she entered a leather factory, working from sunrise to sunset every day without rest. In 1914, when she was twelve years old, she came to Petrograd alone, without any relatives, and entered a laundry factory. She worked an average of sixteen to eighteen hours a day. After work, she immediately lay on the bed like a dead person. The next morning, she dragged her tired body, which had not yet recovered, to work. Although she lived in the capital of Imperial Russia at that time, she did not know that there were theaters, libraries, and schools in the world. These all seemed to have nothing to do with her.

    The February Revolution came, and all the more than 100 female workers in their factory participated in the strike, and the factory closed down. Soon, she went to the Smolny Palace to work as a cleaning worker, and it was here that she met the great Lenin.

    One day, she was chatting with a female worker, Annushka, in the cafeteria. Annushka was a believer, and she said to Elena that the path taken by the Communist Party and Christ was the same, and she wanted to apply to join the Party. Elena disapproved and said, "You are not ashamed. You work here with the Bolsheviks but help the priests. If you apply to join the Party, I will definitely say: you are not worthy!"

    Annushka asked, "Then why don't you join the Party?"

    Elena replied, "I am illiterate and can't reason. To join the Party, you must be educated."

    Suddenly, Lenin walked into the cafeteria. It turned out that he had heard their conversation. Lenin told them that Party members do not believe in God, but Party members do not necessarily have to go to school. The Party first and foremost absorbs workers. The Party is the best school, and the Party will teach us everything…

    These words gave Elena Shakovich great encouragement and courage. She still remembers these words firmly in her heart.

    In 1918, sixteen-year-old Elena took up arms and went to the front line to realize her ideals and defend the young Soviet Republic. It was in the Red Army volunteer unit that she joined the League and the Party. After the war, she was demobilized and went to study at a worker's department attached to a university, while still working at the "Red Triangle" rubber factory. Three years later, she entered the Herzen Pedagogical Institute, graduated and stayed on to work, and later became a graduate student. Since joining the Party in 1919, she has never interrupted her social work. During the upsurge of agricultural collectivization throughout the Soviet Union, she was sent to work in the countryside. During World War II, she served as the acting president of the Herzen Pedagogical Institute. In the difficult days when Leningrad was besieged, she participated in urban defense work and sent many faculty and staff and students to the front line. She proudly told us, "I would rather be born in the era of hungry and cold revolutionary storms than sit and wait for the victory of the revolution. Revolution will always open up the path of life for the oppressed, especially the most deeply oppressed women. But a beautiful and valuable life must be striven for by oneself and cannot wait for it to come by itself."

    In the past two years, while studying in the Soviet Union, I have deeply felt that women's labor occupies an important position in social life. In enterprises, in rural areas, in schools..., there are many women in responsible positions, and women like Elena Shakovich can be found everywhere in the Soviet Union.

    一个普通的苏联妇女
    中国留苏学生　方石
    转了学，不能时常见到我所敬爱的依莲娜·莎可维奇了。但是她的形象时常出现在我的记忆里。
    依莲娜·莎可维奇今年五十五岁了，当然年纪不算太老，但是辛劳、困难的早年生活在她身上留下了烙痕。她的头发已经花白，外貌显得比年龄老些。现在，她是列宁格勒一个师范学院夜大学的负责人，除了行政工作以外，还兼着教课，并且担任学校党委委员。在我几次到她办公室去找她的时候，看见她总是被一些人围着：有来找她商量课程问题的教员，有来征求对自己未来工作的意见的学生，也有像我这样来向她请教党的工作的人。她总是忙着，写着，说着，时常忽然大声地笑起来，笑得直咳嗽。这是一位乐观、能干、忙碌的老太太，但有谁想到在她的生活中却承受过巨大的不幸呢——她的丈夫和唯一的爱子在卫国战争中牺牲了，如今她自己就是她全家唯一的成员。
    依莲娜·莎可维奇待人非常诚恳，对中国留学生的关怀更是无微不至。她只要一看见我们的脸色不好，就发脾气说：“下次再脸色发青来见我，一定要把你们赶回去。”接着又“寒暖起居”问个不休。我们开学习讨论会或检讨会时，她偶尔也参加，并且提出了很多宝贵的意见。有一次，我们中间有人检讨了自己的自高自大，她听到后就很严肃地说：“听人讲，你们党的许多负责同志现在还经常抽空去听哲学课，他们是何等的谦虚，你们难道可以因为一点小小的成绩就满足了，不学习了吗？”她也时常夸奖我们的学习成绩，鼓励大家努力学习。
    去年列宁生日的时候，我们请她谈了她同列宁会见的情形，又请她讲了她个人的生平事迹。
      “如果没有革命，我可能早就成为一个流浪者，死于沉重不堪的劳动中了。我的母亲和姐姐很年青就这样死去了。”她这样开始了关于自己的谈话。
    她是白俄罗斯人。她父亲是给人种地的，母亲也是人家的佣工，早就死了。她七岁那年就被生活所迫去当牧女。九岁时进了皮革厂，每天从日出做工做到日落，不能休息。1914年她十二岁时只身来到了举目无亲的彼得堡，进入一个洗衣厂做工，平均每天工作十六小时到十八小时，下工回到宿舍就立刻像死人一样躺在床上，第二天一清早又拖着还没有恢复过来的疲乏的身子去上工。虽说她那时生活在帝俄首都，但却不知道世界上还有戏院、图书馆、学校，这些都好像与她无缘。
    二月革命来到了，她们厂一百多女工全体参加了罢工，工厂也就此倒闭了。不久，她进了斯摩尔尼宫做打扫工人，就在这里，她见到了伟大的列宁。
    一天，她在食堂里和女工安努什卡谈天。安努什卡是教徒，她对依莲娜说，共产党和基督走的路是一条，她要申请入党。依莲娜很不以为然地说：“你不害臊，在布尔什维克这里工作却帮助神父，如果你申请入党，我一定说：你不配！”
    安努什卡问：“那你为什么不入党呢？”
    依莲娜回答说：“我还不识字，也不会说道理，要入党一定要受过教育才行。”
    突然，列宁走进食堂来了，原来他听见了她们的谈话。列宁告诉她们说，党员是不信神的，但党员却不一定都要进过学校。党首先要吸收的是工人。党是最好的学校，党什么都会教给我们……
    这些话给了依莲娜·莎可维奇很大的鼓励和勇气。这些话直到现在她还牢牢地记在心里。
    1918年，十六岁的依莲娜，为了实现自己的理想，为了保卫年青的苏维埃共和国，拿起枪杆上了前线。就在红军志愿部队里，她入了团，入了党。战后，她复员了，去一个大学附属的工人部念书，同时还在“红三角”橡胶厂工作。三年以后，她进入了赫尔岑师范学院，毕业后留校工作，以后又做了研究生。她从1919年入党以来，从没有中断过社会工作。当全苏农业集体化高潮时期，她曾被派到农村去工作过。在第二次世界大战期间，她担任了赫尔岑师范学院的代理院长。在列宁格勒被围的困难的日子里，她参加了城市保卫工作，送过不少的教职员和学生上前线。她自豪地告诉我们说：“我情愿生长在又饥饿、又寒冷的革命暴风雨时代，而不愿坐待革命胜利。革命总是会给受压迫的人，特别是受压迫最深的妇女打开生活道路的。但是美好的有价值的生活是要靠自己去争取，不能等待它自己到来。”
    这两年，我在苏联学习，深深感到妇女劳动在社会生活中占着重要的地位。在企业里，在农村里，在学校里……，有不少妇女是在负责的岗位上，而像依莲娜·莎可维奇这样的妇女在苏联是到处都可以遇见的。
