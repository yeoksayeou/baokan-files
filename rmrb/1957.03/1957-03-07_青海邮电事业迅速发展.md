The postal and telecommunications services in Qinghai Province have developed rapidly along with the development of socialist construction, especially after the development and exploration of the Qaidam Basin began. In the past year, the postal and telecommunications bureau added 81 self-operated institutions. The number of postal and telecommunications bureaus and offices in the province has reached 135. In one year, eight new self-operated automobile postal routes were opened, including the Qaidam route, totaling 2,461 kilometers. In agricultural and pastoral areas, 656 kilometers of bicycle postal routes and 32 kilometers of walking postal routes were also opened. In addition, radio equipment has been added to the Qaidam Basin. Now, with the exception of a few counties in pastoral areas, all other counties and 145 townships have telephone access. The development of postal and telecommunications services has greatly accelerated the political, economic, cultural, and other connections between all ethnic groups.
