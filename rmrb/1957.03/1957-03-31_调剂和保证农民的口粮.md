Regulating and Guaranteeing Farmers' Food Rations
Commentator of this newspaper

The season of spring plowing is upon us. Ensuring that farmers do not lack food rations during this period is an important part of striving for a bumper agricultural harvest this year.

Nationwide, the vast majority of farmers have enough to eat. This is because although some areas suffered natural disasters last year, the total grain output still increased compared to 1955. Moreover, the state's grain procurement targets have been reduced compared to the previous year, and the phenomenon of the state buying "excess grain" from farmers has been basically eliminated; the state will be responsible for supplying grain to disaster areas, economic crop areas, and some grain-deficient cooperative (households) that are temporarily unable to be self-sufficient. However, due to unreasonable grain distribution in some agricultural cooperatives, there is a significant disparity in grain possession between some farmers and households. In addition, some areas have failed to educate members on conserving grain, and many households have consumed too much grain, which has caused some members to experience varying degrees of difficulty in obtaining food rations. According to a recent survey in Huanggang Prefecture, Hubei Province, approximately 12% of the agricultural cooperatives in the region have 20%-30% of farmers actually lacking grain. A typical survey of some agricultural cooperatives by the grain department of Shandong Province also found that about 20% of the members lack food rations, with each person lacking between twenty and fifty jin. Similar situations exist in other regions.

Some regions have not paid enough attention to the problem of food shortages among some farmers in surplus and self-sufficient cooperatives. Many people only see that most cooperatives have increased production and that the average food ration per member is higher than in previous years, so they dismiss the calls for help from some people facing food shortages as false phenomena. Some grassroots cadres also know that some households are truly short of grain, but they dare not intervene, fearing that "burning incense will attract ghosts." Clearly, this is not a responsible attitude towards the masses. We ask, how can we enable farmers to exert their strength in spring plowing if we do not solve the problem of food rations for those who are short of grain?

What should be done about the problem of food shortages among some farmers in surplus and self-sufficient cooperatives? We believe that the main method is to earnestly organize the internal grain regulation within the agricultural cooperative. This is because the state's grain revenue is less than its sales this year, and scheduling is already difficult. At the same time, the state has left all the grain needed by all members of surplus and self-sufficient cooperatives within the cooperatives; and according to the current situation of grain possession in rural areas, most cooperatives have the potential to solve the problem through internal regulation.

Agricultural cooperatives taking out the cooperative's reserve grain, surplus seeds, and feed grain to regulate the grain supply to farmers who lack grain is an important method of internal grain regulation within the cooperative. According to the investigations of grain departments in various regions, many agricultural cooperatives in Hubei, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Sichuan, Hunan, and other provinces retained a significant amount of reserve grain, seeds, and feed during the autumn harvest distribution last year. Nineteen agricultural cooperatives in Qinyang County, Henan Province, solved 62.68% of the total grain shortage of these agricultural cooperatives by clearing up inventories and taking out more than 123,000 jin of cooperative reserve grain and surplus feed grain. Liu Zhuang Township in Kaifeng County, Henan Province, originally requested the state to supply 20,000 jin of grain. After a thorough inspection by the grain department, it was found that the cooperative had retained a large amount of reserve grain. As a result, the food rations of grain-deficient households were completely solved by the cooperative itself.

Last year, some agricultural cooperatives adopted the method of distributing grain according to the strength of labor and the number of work points earned during the autumn harvest distribution. As a result, members with strong labor and more work points received grain far exceeding the required grain standard; while those with weak labor or fewer work points did not receive the necessary food rations. Another situation is that grain was distributed equally regardless of the size of the household, resulting in households with more children and elderly people having a surplus of grain, while households with more young and middle-aged people and fewer children and elderly people not having enough grain. For example, in some agricultural cooperatives in Shandong Province, some members were allocated 1,100 jin of grain per year, while others were allocated only 300 jin or less. Therefore, it is entirely possible to carry out surplus and deficiency regulation among members. Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Nanzheng County, Shaanxi Province, not only ensured the food needs of everyone but also had extra grain to sell to the state by changing the method of equal grain distribution.

To do a good job in regulating surpluses and deficiencies among members, meticulous ideological education and organizational work must be done to prevent coercion and commandism. Otherwise, it will create artificial tension on the grain issue and will not conform to the state's policy of allowing free disposal of surplus grain after unified purchase. The experience of many regions proves that farmers can carry out regulation under the principle of voluntary mutual benefit if the real situation of each household's surplus and deficient grain is calculated and the principle of mutual regulation is explained to the farmers. When Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Nanzheng County, Shaanxi Province, organized farmers to regulate surpluses and deficiencies, it first conducted a household-by-household survey and in-depth understanding of the masses' ideological conditions. In this way, on the one hand, it clarified the false phenomena on the issue of grain shortage and solved the problem of grain-deficient households, and at the same time, it made the farmers who took out surplus grain feel correct and reasonable.

Naturally, after the internal grain regulation work of the cooperative has been carried out earnestly, if the food rations of some members of individual surplus and self-sufficient cooperatives still cannot be solved, the state grain authorities should provide them.

In addition, running state-owned grain markets well and vigorously carrying out social surplus and deficiency regulation is also an important issue. In mid-February, Jiangxi Province opened a total of 709 state-owned grain markets, with more than 10.87 million jin of grain on the market. According to statistics from 99 grain markets in 23 counties in Shanxi Province in late January, 1.89 million jin of grain were on the market. This shows that there is indeed a considerable amount of surplus grain in rural areas that can be regulated. In some places, the market price of grain in the grain market is much higher than the listed price, and black market transactions have also occurred. This is certainly because the amount and variety of grain on the market cannot fully meet the needs, but more importantly, it is due to the lack of leadership and abandonment of necessary management in the market. Some comrades do not want to open grain markets because they are afraid of trouble, which is wrong.

Grain work is closely related to agricultural production, especially at the critical moment of spring plowing. Party and government leading organs at all levels should actively find ways to help farmers who lack grain overcome difficulties, and should not adopt a bureaucratic attitude of ignoring them on the grounds of this or that reason.

    调剂和保证农民的口粮
    本报评论员
    春耕生产的季节已到。在这个期间保证农民不缺口粮，是争取今年农业大丰收的重要一环。
    就全国范围来说，绝大部分农民的口粮是够吃的。这是因为去年虽然有部分地区遭受自然灾害，但粮食总产量仍然较1955年有了增加。而国家的征购任务却比上年度有所减少，国家向农民买“过头粮”的现象基本消除；灾区、经济作物区和某些粮食暂时还不能自给的缺粮社（户）所缺粮食，国家都将负责供应。但是，由于有些地区农业社在粮食分配上不尽合理，造成一部分农户与农户之间粮食占有量悬殊。加之有些地区未能对社员进行节约用粮的教育，许多户过多地消耗了粮食，这就使得有些社员的口粮在不同程度上发生了困难。据湖北省黄冈专区最近调查，全区大约12％的农业社中有20％—30％的农民实际缺粮，山东省粮食部门对一些农业社的典型调查，也发现有20％左右的社员口粮不足，每人缺粮二十斤至五十斤不等。其他各地也有类似的情况。
    对余粮社和自足社内这一部分农民缺粮的问题，有些地区还没有引起重视。不少人只看到大多数社增加了产量，社员平均口粮比前几年多一些，因此就把某些群众缺粮的呼声一律看作是虚假现象。一部分基层干部也知道有些户真正缺粮，但是不敢过问，他们害怕“烧香引出鬼来”。显然，这都不是对群众负责任的态度。试问，不解决缺粮农民的口粮问题，怎么能使他们在春耕生产中发挥力量呢？
    对余粮社和自足社内部分农民缺口粮的问题应该怎么办？我们认为，主要办法是认真地组织农业社社内粮食调剂。这是因为本年度国家粮食收少销多，调度已有一定困难，同时，余粮社和自足社全体社员所需粮食，国家都已留在社内；而按目前农村粮食占有情况，大部分社有可能依靠社内调剂解决问题。
    农业社把社内机动粮和多余的种子、饲料粮拿出调剂给缺粮农民，是社内粮食调剂的重要方法。根据各地粮食部门的调查，湖北、河南、河北、山东、四川、湖南等省的很多农业社在去年秋收分配时留下了数量不小的机动粮、种子和饲料。河南省沁阳县十九个农业社通过清整库存、拿出社内机动粮和饲料结余粮共十二万三千多斤，解决了这些农业社缺粮总数的62.68％。河南开封县刘庄乡原来向国家要求供应二万斤粮食，经过粮食部门深入检查，发现这个社留有大批机动粮，结果缺粮户的口粮完全由社内自行解决了。
    去年有些农业社在秋收分配粮食时，采取了按照劳动力强弱，所得工分多少来分配的办法，结果是劳动力强、工分多的社员分得的粮食大大超过了必须用粮的标准；而劳动力弱或工分少的人得不到必需的口粮。另一种情况是，不论大口小口，一律平均分配粮食，结果造成了小孩和老人多的户粮食有节余，青壮年多，小孩和老人少的户粮食又不够吃。譬如，山东省部分农业社有些社员一人全年分配到一千一百斤粮食，有些社员却只分到三百斤或不足三百斤。因此在社员之间进行余缺调剂，是完全可能的。陕西省南郑县五星农业社由于改变了平均分配粮食的办法，结果不但保证了每个人的口粮需要，而且还多出一部分粮食卖给国家。
    在社员之间做好余缺的调剂，要做细致的思想教育和组织工作，防止强迫命令。否则就会在粮食问题上造成人为的紧张，并且也不符合国家在统购后准许自由处理余粮的政策。很多地区的经验证明，算清每户余缺粮的真实情况，向农民讲明相互调剂的道理，农民是能够在自愿互利的原则下进行调剂的。陕西省南郑县五星农业社组织农民调剂余缺时，首先进行了逐户摸底排队的工作，深入地了解了群众的思想状况，这样一方面澄清了缺粮问题上的虚假现象，解决了缺粮户的问题，同时也使拿出余粮的农民感到正确和合理。
    自然，在社内粮食调剂工作已经认真进行以后，如果个别余粮社和自足社仍有部分社员口粮不能解决，国家粮食机关是应该给予供应的。
    另外，办好国家的粮食市场，大力开展社会余缺的调剂，也是一个重要的问题。江西省在2月中旬，共开放了七百零九个国家粮食市场，上市粮食达一千零八十七万多斤。据山西省二十三个县的九十九个粮食市场在1月下旬统计，上市粮食达到一百八十九万斤。由此可见农村中确实有相当数量的余粮可以进行调剂。有些地方粮食市场的市价高出牌价很多，也发生了黑市交易。这固然是由于上市量和粮种不能完全满足需要，但更为重要的则是对市场领导不够、放弃了必要的管理所致。有些同志因怕麻烦而不愿开放粮食市场，这是不对的。
    粮食工作和农业生产紧密相关。特别是在春耕紧要关头，就更加重要。各级党政领导机关应当积极设法帮助缺粮农民克服困难，而不应当借口这样那样一些原因，采取置之不理的官僚主义态度。
