The Importance of Studying Socialist Thought
　　Liu Fengzhu's Speech
　　I wholeheartedly support Chairman Zhou Enlai's report on his visit to eleven Asian and European countries. I fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's summary report on the work of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee and the training classes for industrialists and businessmen. I am a cadre working in the education sector, a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and an old intellectual. My work and theoretical levels are not very high. I would like to make a simple speech on the issue of strengthening the study of socialist thought.

　　China's socialist revolution has reached today, achieving a fundamental victory in socialist transformation and vigorously developing in socialist construction. Along with the significant achievements in the quantity and quality of the country's industry, agriculture, and transportation, a massive upsurge in socialist ideological education has also been launched. Since the Party Central Committee issued the call to advance towards science and culture in 1956, cadres at all levels across the country, workers and staff in factories, mines, enterprises, and cooperatives, teachers and students in large, medium, and small schools, as well as active men and women in street work, have shown joyful moods, encouraged courage, yearned for the beautiful prospects of socialism, and studied diligently and tirelessly. Such a healthy form and great achievement of theory combined with practice, education combined with politics, and thought combined with work should be affirmed by our people nationwide, and it is also something we are proud of in our hearts!

　　One-Sidedness in Thinking Methods is Quite Common Among Intellectuals

　　Socialist thought is the complete law of the development of things, not something one-sided, mechanical, or rigid. Its understanding of objective things is to find the correct line and active forces through methods that are both anti-left and anti-right, taking into account both quantity and quality, in order to achieve a unity of the subjective and the objective. However, the intellectuals in our country today, and I am one of them, for the most part, have not been able to escape the traps of idealistic thinking and formal logic, except for a very few. That is to say, the understanding of things, the arrangement of work, and the understanding of national policies and guidelines are mostly one-sided, isolated, only seeing the dragon scales but not the dragon claws, only seeing the tiger's head but not the tiger's tail. Let me simply cite a few facts.

　　In the understanding of letting a hundred flowers bloom: only knowing that fragrant flowers are sweet and can be used as drinks, not knowing that poisonous weeds are bitter and can be used as medicine; only seeing the fixed nature of the heredity of flower seeds, but not seeing the adaptive transformation of poisonous weeds. In the aspect of advancing towards science: emphasizing that science can utilize nature, thereby improving material life, but neglecting that the cultivation of politics can transform people's thoughts, thereby increasing the soul of material life, so as to avoid rigidity. In propaganda and education: heavily publicizing the prosperity, strength, and happy life of the Soviet Union today, but neglecting the heroic struggles and difficult situations of the Soviet Union during domestic struggles and the Patriotic War, thus more or less fostering the erroneous ideas of some young people who are fond of ease and dislike hard work, and want to reach the sky in one step, thereby obliterating the truth that the ancients said, "A long journey must start from nearby, and ascending high must start from low." In the aspect of farmland water conservancy: some cooperatives emphasized the plan of diverting water for drought prevention but neglected the preparation for drainage and flood prevention. After suffering from floods, the poor peasants in the cooperatives "blamed the heavens but not the commune" in their thinking, while the wealthy middle peasants and landlords "blamed the commune but not the heavens" in their thinking, each seeing only a part and not the whole. In the aspect of primary school education, in 1956, the Ministry of Education, adapting to the needs of social development, expanded the number of students enrolled and implemented a two-shift system. Primary school students' lives in school are only five hours a day, and the rest of the time is spent on activities outside of school. The places for extracurricular activities are not educational museums and libraries, because these places neither welcome children to visit nor have facilities for children to read books; nor are they parks and cinemas, because these two places are not allowed to enter without tickets. Children with generally weak family education have no choice but to wander the streets or stroll through department stores. After entering department stores, they are unconsciously dominated by Pavlov's "conditioned reflex." That is to say: seeing bread and candy, they want to eat; seeing art toys, they want to buy. Without money in their hands, they have to use a trick left over from the old society, and that trick is "stealing." In the initial stage of stealing, they still feel their hearts pounding and their hands trembling, their heads hot and their eyes swelling, but after many thefts, they feel at ease and content, acting as if nothing had happened, and their eyes are sharp and their hands are quick, they have skills and courage. In the end, some students not only cannot repent and start anew, but are getting worse, and especially call on their peers to expand their team, have organizations, have discipline, and also have slang and secret codes. As a result, some primary school students become habitual, deeply ingrained, and develop the ability and courage to become habitual thieves. The students' parents accuse the school of saying: This is because the school only manages but does not guide; the school says: This is because the parents can raise but cannot teach; people in society say: This is because the quality of school education is not high. Each holds his own view, each sees one side, and regards the organic connection of family education, school education, and social environment education as an isolated and deformed individual.

　　The constituent causes of the above facts, although they have their accidental and special conditions, the one-sidedness and isolation in thinking and understanding, only seeing the trees but not the forest, only seeing one but not two, is its main root cause. Whether this essence of thought is called idealism, or subjectivism, or formal logic, it is definitely not socialist thought.

　　Comrades, we have already begun to enter a socialist society. In the process of socialist development and progress, the composition of society cannot be purely uniform, but multi-faceted. In terms of economic structure, the relations of production are advanced, and the productive forces are backward. In terms of social consciousness: new socialist ideas are blossoming, while old bourgeois ideas have not yet withered. A multi-faceted winding road is arranged on the road to socialist advancement; it also shows a speed that is sometimes fast and sometimes slow, sometimes up and sometimes down. In the construction of various undertakings, there are contradictions that exist in varying degrees and adhere to a sharp struggle that is seemingly intermittent and seemingly weak. Therefore, reaching socialist society, our country has its smoothness, but also its difficulties; it has its humility, but also its self-confidence.

　　Only by Strengthening Study Can People from Democratic Parties Do a Good Job

　　Comrades, our socialism is superior; the economic system is advanced; the mass line is correct; the government's policies are appropriate; the people are kind, intelligent, and patriotic. It can be said that in the smooth journey towards socialist society, the key role is played by the large and small links in the superstructure system. The united front is one of these links, and its role is to correctly implement the government's policies to the people, and to correctly reflect the opinions and demands of the people to the government. The task of this link is to be a government assistant with duties, powers, wisdom, and ability. Who is this assistant? It is the democratic parties, non-party individuals, various nationalities, and democratic people from all strata of society in the united front. They have the ability to act as bridges and assistants, and also have the enthusiasm to serve actively. So, how can they accomplish their tasks? They must have the standpoint of the working class; the viewpoint of the mass line; and the method of materialist dialectics. So, how can they improve to this level? They must eliminate the following three obstacles in their work practice: The first is sectarianism in organization. The second is subjectivism in thinking; the third is bureaucratism in style. So, what effort is needed to eliminate these three obstacles? It is necessary to strengthen the study of socialist thought. This is because with socialist thought, we can overcome the difficulties in socialist advancement, solve the problems in advancement, and at the same time, we can victoriously reach a socialist society. So, what should we study? The main thing is to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. So, what methods and attitudes should we use to study? It is what Chairman Mao has instructed us: the attitude and method of combining theory with practice, practice improving theory; learning, practice; and then practice and then learning.

　　Comrades, socialist thought is the soul of political life and the driving force of economic production. We have the courage and confidence that under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we will work actively and study actively, and we will be able to reach socialist society easily and happily within the next ten years; and then, holding high the banner of mutual supervision and long-term coexistence, continue to move forward, continue to learn, and enter communist society!

### 社会主义思想学习的重要性　刘风竹的发言

    社会主义思想学习的重要性
　　刘风竹的发言
    我衷心地拥护周恩来主席关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告。我完全同意陈叔通副主席关于第二届全国委员会常务委员会的工作和工商业者讲习班的总结报告。我是教育部门工作的一个干部，是一个民革的成员、一个旧知识分子，工作和理论的水平均不甚高，我愿就加强社会主义思想的学习问题，作个简单的发言。
    中国的社会主义革命事业到了今天，在社会主义改造方面已经取得了基本性的胜利，在社会主义建设方面正在蓬勃的发展着。随着全国的工业、农业、交通事业在数量上和质量上的显著成绩，而社会主义的思想教育亦掀起了庞大的高潮。自从党中央在1956年提出了向科学和向文化进军的号召以来，全国各级干部、工矿、企业、合作社的职工，大中小学的教师和学生们，以及街道工作中的男女积极分子都表现出愉快的心情，鼓舞着勇气，向往着社会主义美丽的前景，辛勤不懈地学习。像这样的理论结合实践，教育结合政治，思想结合工作的健康形式和伟大的成就是我们全国人民应当首先肯定的，也是我们内心自豪的！
    在知识分子当中思想方法上的片面性颇为普遍
    社会主义的思想是事物发展的完整规律，不是片面的、机械的和僵化的东西。它对客观事物的认识是通过既反左又反右；既顾量又顾质的方法，来找出正确的路线和积极的力量，以达到主客观一致的境地。但是现在我国的知识分子，我是滥竽充数的一员，除去极少数以外，尚未能跳出唯心主义思想的形式逻辑的陷阱。这就是说，对事物的认识和工作的安排，以及对国家方针政策的理解，多半是片面的、孤立的，只看见龙鳞而看不见龙爪，只看见虎头而看不见虎尾。简单地举几个事实来说吧。
    在百花齐放的认识上：只知道香花味甘，可作饮料，不知道毒草味苦，可作药材；仅看见花种遗传性的固定，而看不见毒草适应性的转化。在科学进军方面：重视了科学能利用自然，因而提高了物质生活，而忽视了政治的修养能改造人的思想，因而增加了物质生活的灵魂，免得僵化。在宣传教育方面：着重地宣传了苏联今天的繁荣富强、幸福生活，而忽视了苏联在国内斗争和卫国战争时期的英勇苦斗和艰难的处境，因而或多或少地助长了部分青年，好逸恶劳，不耐吃苦，一步登天的错误思想，因而抹杀了古人所说的行远必自迩，升高必自卑的真理。在农田水利方面：有些合作社重视了引水防旱的计划而忽视了排水防涝的准备。遭受水灾之后，社内的贫农在思想上“怨天不怨社”，富裕中农和地主在思想上“怨社不怨天”，各窥一斑，不见全豹。在小学教育方面，1956年教育部适应社会发展的需要，扩大了招生的数字，施行了二部制。小学校的学生在校中的生活，每日不过五小时，其余的时间均在校外活动。校外活动的场所不是有教育意义的博物馆和图书馆，因为这些地方既不欢迎儿童参观，又无儿童阅书的设备；更不是公园和电影院，因为这两处是无票不准擅入的。一般家教薄弱的儿童们只有流浪街头，或者逛游百货公司。他们进入百货公司之后，就不知不觉地受到巴甫洛夫学说“条件反射”的支配。这就是说：见着面包糖果就想要吃；见着艺术玩具就想要买。手中无钱，只得使用旧社会遗留下来的一个窍门，这个窍门就是
  “偷门”。初次偷盗的时期尚觉着心跳手颤，头热眼涨，但是到了多次偷盗之后，就觉着心安意得，行若无事，而且眼尖手快，有了技术也有了胆量。最后，部分学生不但不能悔过自新而且是每况愈下，特别的还号召同类，扩大队伍，有了组织，有了纪律，也有了行话和暗号。结果，部分小学生就习惯成性，积重难反，以致养成惯窃的本领和勇气。学生家长们责备学校说：这是因为学校管教不管导的过错，学校说：这是家长能养不能教的过错；社会上人士说：这是因为学校教育质量不高的过错。各执一词，各见一面，把家庭教育、学校教育和社会环境教育的有机联系看成了孤立畸形的个体。
    以上所举这些事实的构成原因，虽然有它的偶然性和特殊条件，但是思想上和认识上的片面性和孤立性，只见树不见林，只见一不见二的本质是它的主要根源。这种思想的本质叫作唯心主义也好，叫作主观主义也好，叫作形式逻辑也好，但不是社会主义的思想是可以十分肯定的。
    同志们，我们已经开始进入了社会主义社会，在社会主义发展前进的过程中，社会的成分不可能是单纯一色的，而是多式多样的，在经济结构方面，生产关系是先进的，生产力是落后的。在社会意识方面：新的社会主义思想正在开花，而旧的资产阶级思想尚未雕谢。在社会主义前进的大道上罗列着一段多角多面的弯曲道路；也表现着有快有慢，有起有伏的速度。在多种事业的建设中，存在着或多或少的矛盾并坚持着似断非断似弱非弱的尖锐斗争。因之，走到社会主义社会，我们国家有它的顺利，也有它的困难；有它的谦虚，也有它的自信。
    各民主党派人士只有加强学习才能作好工作
    同志们，我国的社会主义是优越的；经济制度是先进的；群众路线是正确的；政府的方针政策是适当的；人民群众是善良、聪明、爱国的。可以说，在走向社会主义社会顺利的路途中，起着关键性的作用的就是上层建筑制度系统中的大小环节。统一战线就是这些环节中的一个环节，它的作用是把政府的方针政策正确地贯彻到人民群众，又把人民群众的意见和要求正确地反映到政府。这个环节的任务是有职有权，有智有能的政府助手。这个助手是谁呢？就是统一战线中各民主党派、无党无派、各民族和社会上各阶层的民主人士。他们有当桥梁和助手的能力，也有积极服务的热诚。那末，怎样才能完成他们的任务呢？他们必须有工人阶级的立场；群众路线的观点；和唯物辩证的方法。那末，怎样才能提高到这样的水平呢？必须在工作实践中扫除以下三种障碍：第一种是在组织上的宗派主义。第二种是在思想上的主观主义；第三种是在作风上的官僚主义。那末，用什么工夫才能扫除这三种障碍呢？必得加强社会主义思想的学习。这是因为有了社会主义思想才能克服社会主义前进中的困难，解决前进中的问题，同时才能胜利地走到社会主义的社会。那末，学习什么呢？主要的是学习马列主义和毛泽东思想。那末，用什么方法和态度来学习呢？就是毛主席所指示我们的：理论结合实践，实践提高理论；学习，实践；再实践再学习的态度和方法。
    同志们，社会主义的思想是政治生活的灵魂，是经济生产的动力。我们有勇气，也有信心，在共产党和毛主席正确领导之下，积极工作，积极学习，今后十年之内，一定能够轻松愉快的走到社会主义社会；而后，再高举着互相监督，长期共存的旗帜，继续前进，继续学习，走入共产主义社会！（附图片）
