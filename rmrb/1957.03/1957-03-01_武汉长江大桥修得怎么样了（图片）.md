The days of "a bridge flying across the north and south, turning a natural barrier into a thoroughfare" are coming soon. After more than a year of hard work by the bridge builders, the foundation work of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is nearing completion before the arrival of the peach blossom flood season this year. The eight bridge piers in the deep and rapid currents will soon all reach the design elevation. Now, giant steel beams are constantly extending from both banks towards the center of the river and are expected to be joined in May of this year; other construction projects - the paving of the highway surface, the construction of the approach bridge, and the overpass, etc. - are also in full swing. Xinhua News Agency reporter Yan Zhennan photographed.

    The huge steel beam has crossed the third pier from the Hanyang bridgehead and is approaching the fourth pier.
    The bridge abutment where the approach bridge connects to the main bridge is also nearing completion. Soon, the bridgehead elevator will be installed here.

    武汉长江大桥修得怎么样了
   “一桥飞架南北，天堑变通途”的日子，即将来到。经过建桥者一年多的辛勤劳动，在今年桃汛季节来临以前，武汉长江大桥的基础工程就接近全部完成，深水急流中八个桥墩，即将全部到达设计标高。现在，巨型钢梁正在不停地从两岸向江心伸展，预计今年5月就能合拢；其他一些工程项目——公路面的铺筑、引桥、跨线桥的修建等也在紧张进行。  新华社记者  严震南摄

    巨大的钢梁，已从汉阳桥头越过三号桥墩向四号桥墩靠近。
    引桥和正桥接连处的桥台也接近完成。不久以后，桥头电梯就将在这里 安装起来。
