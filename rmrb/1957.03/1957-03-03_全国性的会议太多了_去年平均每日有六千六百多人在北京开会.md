    Too Many National Conferences
    Last Year, an Average of More Than Six Thousand Six Hundred People Attended Meetings in Beijing Daily
    Qi Min
    According to incomplete statistics from the Government Offices Administration of the State Council, in 1956, central government departments convened a total of 1,570 national conferences (excluding conferences funded by Party dues and operational expenses). The number of participants was over 157,000, totaling more than 2.42 million workdays. On average, more than 6,630 people attended meetings in Beijing every day. This required more than 220 large buses (each carrying 30 people) dedicated to transporting people attending meetings in Beijing and twelve large hotels the size of the Beijing Hotel to house those attending meetings in Beijing throughout the year. During the meetings, the state spent a total of 9,532,509 yuan on conference expenses.
    What do these figures illustrate? They indicate that some units of central government departments held too many meetings in 1956. Here, we are not generally opposed to holding meetings (necessary and well-prepared meetings should be held), but we are opposed to those meetings that should not be held but are; opposed to those meetings that, although they should be held, are prolonged without resolving problems due to the convening units' lack of adequate preparation; opposed to the extravagant and wasteful style of spending large sums of state money at meetings.
    Of course, many units within the central government departments convened meetings that were necessary and relatively successful. Such meetings generally had fewer participants, shorter durations, smaller expenses, and were able to resolve important issues that urgently needed to be addressed in leadership work. The Ministry of Agriculture originally planned to hold eleven large-scale national conferences in 1956, but because the Ministry of Agriculture was very cautious about convening national conferences, after repeated and careful study of some conferences that were originally planned, they believed that problems could be solved without holding meetings, so they resolutely canceled them. Some meetings that should have been held were postponed because the relevant departments had not done a good job in preparing for the meetings. As a result, only six national conferences were actually held last year. Therefore, the meetings they convened were generally very good and successful. For example, the National Agricultural Work Conference held in December last year wrote the issues to be resolved at the meeting into an outline two months before the meeting, which was sent to various regions, asking the participants to prepare, deliberate, and discuss in advance. The date of the meeting was only decided after all the preparations were completed, and the number of participants was strictly limited to within seventy people, so that the meeting was compact and solved problems. As a result, in the past year, the number of people who participated in the Ministry of Agriculture's meetings was only 1,010, and the meeting expenses were only 82,000 yuan.
    However, some units did not pay enough attention to the issue of convening national conferences, the leadership did not strictly control the meetings, the organization of the meetings was lax, and the leadership was not specific, resulting in many participants, long meeting periods, and even duplication of meetings, causing a lot of waste in human and material resources. The Ministry of Commerce convened 182 national conferences last year, with more than 27,100 participants. On average, more than 70 people attended meetings in the ministry every day of the year. The First Ministry of Machine Building held 92 meetings, with 11,300 participants, averaging more than 30 people attending meetings in Beijing every day. Were these meetings all completely necessary and indispensable? In fact, this was not the case. For example, the eight commodity storage and transportation conferences and two financial accounting conferences convened by the Ministry of Commerce were all about studying and summarizing some working methods and formulating some working systems. Many comrades in the ministry believed that holding these meetings was "wasteful of manpower and money" and unnecessary. The First Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building convened a national personnel work conference last year, and then held labor wage, labor-capital section chief, and wage reform conferences. The Agricultural Products Procurement Department convened six meetings on cotton allocation and cotton unified purchase on the issue of cotton procurement alone. Could it be said that none of these meetings with largely the same nature could be streamlined or merged? The large number of participants in some meetings was also quite alarming. The China Department Store convened a manager and commodity supply meeting, with as many as 2,080 participants, bringing the managers of many county department stores to Beijing for a meeting that lasted as long as 46 days.
    The situation of insufficient meeting preparation was also quite serious. The National Slide Work Conference convened by the Ministry of Culture last year was notified to be held on October 22, requiring representatives from all regions to register in Beijing before the 21st. However, when the participants arrived in Beijing, they could not find a place to register. It turned out that the slide conference had been decided to be postponed, but they forgot to notify the various regions. The China Department Store convened a national glass ordering conference in December last year. The conference held an opening ceremony on December 2, and after a section chief gave a 75-minute report, due to the lack of adequate preparation for the meeting, it had to announce a temporary adjournment of five days. The representatives had nothing to do and had to sleep and play cards. No wonder some people said that attending this meeting was to come to Beijing for a "vacation."
    Extravagant waste was also relatively serious in many meetings. According to statistics, the meetings convened by the central government departments in 1956 cost an average of 5.10 yuan per person per day in public funds. The expenses of some meetings convened by individual units such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and the All-China Women's Federation averaged more than 12 yuan per person per day. Some units, regardless of the nature of the meeting, rented the best cars and hotels, thus creating artificial tension in hotels and transportation. Although the State Council clearly stipulated in 1955 that general meetings were not allowed to host garden parties, theatrical performances, and dinners, many units did not implement this instruction. According to statistics from fourteen meetings of fourteen units under the State Council, the expenses for meeting receptions accounted for more than 47% of the expenses for public expenses. The extravagance and waste of individual meetings was simply staggering. For example, the National First Staff and Workers Science and Technology Popularization Activists Conference jointly convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization only held a seven-day meeting and spent 300,000 yuan, which is more than three times the annual meeting expenses of the Ministry of Agriculture!
    Some comrades say that holding receptions at meetings is to express enthusiasm to the participants and show the spirit and grandeur of the central leading organs. They believe that when comrades working in the central government go to the lower levels (provinces and cities), they receive generous receptions from the local areas, and it is not "humane" not to entertain the comrades who come to the central government. These "reasons" are obviously insufficient. Is it possible that there are no other ways to express cordial enthusiasm to comrades besides inviting them to watch operas, visit gardens, and eat meals? Is this trend of taking the state's money to express "human feelings" sustainable? The essence of the problem lies in the lack of a hard-working and simple leadership style and work style in the units convening the meetings and the people presiding over the meetings.
    It is hoped that the central government departments can seriously reduce the number of national meetings in the future.

    全国性的会议太多了
    去年平均每日有六千六百多人在北京开会
    启民
    据国务院机关事务管理局不完全的统计，1956年中央各机关共召开了一千五百七十次全国性会议 （由党费和事业费内开支的会议未计算在内），参加会议的人数是十五万七千余人，共用了二百四十二万多个工作日，平均每天有六千六百三十多人在北京开会。这样，就需要二百二十多辆大汽车（每辆乘坐三十人）专供在北京开会的人乘坐，需要十二个像北京饭店那样大的大旅馆常年供来北京开会的人居住。在开会期间，国家共开支了会议经费九百五十三万二千五百零九元。
    这些数目字说明什么呢？它说明1956年度中央机关的某些单位开会太多了。在这里，并不是一般地反对开会（必要的和有准备的会是应当开的），而是反对那些不应当召开而召开的会议；反对那些虽然应当召开但由于召集会议的单位对会议缺乏充分准备，致使会议拖得很长而又不解决问题的会议；反对在会议中大手大脚大量浪费国家金钱的铺张浪费作风。
    当然，在中央各机关中，有许多单位所召开的会议都是应当召开而且开得比较成功的。这样的会议一般参加会议的人员较少，会期较短，会议的开支小，而且能解决领导工作中迫切需要解决的重要问题。农业部原决定1956年要召开十一次全国性的大型会议，但由于农业部对召开全国性会议问题非常慎重，对有些原准备召开的会议，经过反复认真地研究，认为不开会也能解决问题，就坚决不开了；有些应当召开的会议，由于有关部门对会议的准备工作没有做好，决定把会期向后推迟了，结果去年实际上只召开了六次全国性会议。因此，他们所召开的会议一般都开得很好，很成功。如去年12月开的全国农业工作会议，在开会的前两个月就把会议要解决的问题写成提纲，发往各地区，请参加会议的人预先进行准备、酝酿和讨论，待一切准备工作都做好了，才决定开会日期，而且把参加会议的人数严格限制在七十人以内，这样就使这个会议开得紧凑又解决问题。这样，在去年一年里，参加农业部各次会议的人数只有一千零十人，会议开支只有八万二千元。
    但是，也有一些单位对召开全国性会议的问题重视不够，领导上对会议控制不严，会议的组织工作松弛，领导不具体，致使与会人员多，会期长，甚至会与会互相重复，造成人力物力上的许多浪费。商业部去年召开了一百八十二次全国性会议，参加会议的人数达二万七千一百多人，一年三百六十五天中每天平均有七十多人在部里开会。第一机械工业部开会九十二次，与会人数一万一千三百人，平均每天有三十多人在北京开会。这些会议是不是都是完全必要和非开不可的呢？事实上并不是这样。如商业部所召开的八次商品储运会议和两次财务会计会议，都是研究和总结一些工作方法和制定一些工作制度，部里有不少同志认为开这些会议是“劳民伤财”，是不必要召开的。第一机械工业部第一局去年召开了一次全国性的人事工作会议以后，又开了劳动工资、劳资科长和工资改革会议。而农产品采购部只在棉花收购问题上就召开了棉花调拨和棉花统购等六次会议。难道说这些性质大体相同的会议一个都不能精简或者合并吗？有些会议与会人数之多也是十分惊人的。中国百货公司所召开的经理和商品供应会议，参加会议的人数多至二千零八十人，把许多县百货公司的经理都召来北京开会，会期长达四十六天。
    会议准备不充分的情况，也是相当严重的。文化部去年召开的全国幻灯工作会议，通知是10月22日开会，要求各地代表必须在21日前到京报到。但是当与会代表赶到北京之后，却找不到一个报到的地方。原来幻灯会议已决定延期了，但是却忘记了通知各地。中国百货公司去年12月召开了全国玻璃订货会议，大会在12月2日举行开幕式，由一个处长作了七十五分钟的报告之后，由于对会议缺乏充分准备，不得不宣布暂时休会五天。代表们无事可做，只好睡觉打扑克，难怪有人说参加这个会是来北京“休假”了。
    在不少会议中，铺张浪费的现象也是比较严重的。据统计，1956年中央各机关所召开的会议，平均每人每天花费公款五元一角，个别单位如外交部、冶金工业部、全国妇联等召开的有些会议的开支，平均每人每天在十二元以上。有的单位不管召开什么性质的会议，租赁汽车、旅馆都是要最好的，因此造成旅馆和交通工具人为的紧张。虽然国务院在1955年就明文规定一般会议不准招待游园、看戏和聚餐，但是许多单位都没有执行这项指示。据国务院所属十四个单位的十四次会议的统计，会议招待费的开支平均占公杂费开支的47％以上。有个别会议的铺张浪费简直达到惊人的程度。如全国总工会和全国科学技术普及协会联合召开的全国第一次职工科学技术普及工作积极分子大会，只开了七天会，就花费三十万元，等于农业部全年会议开支的三倍多！
    有同志说，开会进行招待，是为了向参加会议的人表示热情，表现出中央领导机关的气魄和会议的隆重。认为在中央工作的同志到下面去的时候（各省、市），都受到地方上优厚的招待，下面同志到中央来不招待有些不近“人情”。这些“理由”显然是不充分的。难道说为了向同志们表示亲切热情，除了请看戏、游园、吃饭以外就再没有其他办法了吗？这种拿国家的钱去表示“人情”的风气是可长的吗？问题的实质就在于召开会议的单位和主持会议的人缺乏艰苦朴素的领导作风和工作作风。
    希望中央各机关，今后能够认真地减少一下全国性的会议。
