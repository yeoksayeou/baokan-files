Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 28th - Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Józef Cyrankiewicz, and Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, issued a joint statement here on March 27th, reaffirming their confidence in the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and calling for cooperation among major powers to seek solutions to international problems.

The statement, issued by the two government leaders after their talks, said they were concerned about the deterioration of the international situation in recent months. They believed that determined and unremitting efforts should be made to reverse this trend, bring greater hope for peace and cooperation to the world, and avoid conflict.

The statement said that while recognizing the responsibility of their respective governments in this regard, they believed that only through cooperation among the world's major powers for these purposes can international tensions be eased, the threat of conflict and war eliminated, and lasting solutions to international problems be found.

The Indian and Polish governments announced in Warsaw in June 1955 their acceptance of the Five Principles as the basis for relations between the two countries and their relations with other countries. The statement said that these principles are now widely recognized as a solid foundation for international cooperation, and they believe that these principles should guide relations between independent and sovereign states.

The statement said that military alliances cannot guarantee world peace and international security. They earnestly hope that people will recognize the dangers to peace of the policy of military treaties and abandon this approach, replacing it with collective peace based on the principles of the United Nations Charter. The two Prime Ministers expressed their full support for the aspirations and struggles of people striving for liberation from colonial rule.

The statement expressed an urgent hope that the Disarmament Commission and its subcommittee would seek to expand the scope of agreements between major powers on limiting armaments and prohibiting weapons of mass destruction. The statement said that, as a first step, certain limitations on armaments should be implemented immediately under mutually agreed inspection and supervision measures, while prohibiting nuclear and thermonuclear weapons. The statement called for the abandonment of experimental explosions of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons.

Nehru and Cyrankiewicz deeply regretted the absence of the People's Republic of China from the United Nations. They said they would continue to make efforts to change this situation.

They expressed satisfaction with the withdrawal of aggressive forces from Egyptian territory. They said that recent events in the Middle East and the continuing tensions in the region clearly demonstrate the urgent need to resolve the problems in this region.

The statement said that these issues should be handled in a spirit of recognizing the independence of the countries in the Middle East, cooperating with them on the basis of recognizing them as sovereign states, rather than on the basis of force or groups of force.

They also expressed the hope that the outstanding issues related to the International Commission for Indochina would be resolved through negotiations and cooperation in accordance with the provisions of the 1954 Geneva Accords.

The statement said that the visit of the Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers to India will further promote the close friendship and understanding between the two countries and their peoples.

　　西伦凯维兹和尼赫鲁联合声明
　　要求大国合作解决国际问题
　　重申对和平共处五项原则的信心
    新华社新德里28日电  波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹和印度总理尼赫鲁3月27日在这里发表联合声明，重申对和平共处五项原则的信心，并且要求大国合作寻求国际问题的解决办法。
    两国政府领导人在会谈结束后发表的这项声明说，他们对最近几个月中国际局势的恶化表示关心。他们认为应该进行有决心的和不懈的努力来扭转这种趋势，给世界带来更大的对和平和合作的希望，并且避免冲突。
    声明说，他们在承认本国政府对此所负的责任的同时，认为要和缓国际紧张局势，消除冲突和战争的威胁，求得国际问题的持久解决，只有世界大国为了这些目的进行合作。
    印度和波兰两国政府曾经在1955年6月在华沙宣布接受五项原则作为两国关系以及他们同其他国家的关系的基础。声明说，这些原则现在已经被普遍承认为国际合作的巩固基础，他们相信，这些原则应该指导独立和主权国家之间的关系。
    声明说，军事联盟是不能够保证世界和平和国际安全的。他们热切希望人们会认识到军事条约政策对和平的危害性，并且放弃这种办法，而代之以根据联合国宪章原则的集体和平。两国总理表示全力支持争取从殖民统治下解放出来的人民的愿望和斗争。
    声明表示迫切希望裁军委员会和它的小组委员会将谋求扩大大国之间在限制军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器方面达成协议的范围。声明说，作为第一步，应该在大家同意的视察和监督措施下立刻对军备实行某些限制，同时禁止核武器和热核武器。声明要求放弃核武器和热核武器的试验性爆炸。
    尼赫鲁和西伦凯维兹对联合国没有中华人民共和国的代表深深表示遗憾。他们说，他们将继续进行努力来改变这种情况。
    他们对侵略部队撤出埃及领土表示满意。他们说，最近在中东发生的事情和这个地区继续存在的紧张局势清楚地表明这个地区的问题迫切地需要解决。
    他们在声明中说，处理这些问题应该本着承认中东地区的国家的独立，在承认它们是主权国家的基础上同它们进行合作的精神，而不是依据强力或是强力集团。
    他们还表示希望和印度支那国际委员会有关的悬而未决的问题，将遵照1954年日内瓦协定的规定通过谈判和合作来解决。
    声明说，波兰部长会议主席对印度的访问，将进一步促进两国和两国人民之间的密切友谊和了解。
