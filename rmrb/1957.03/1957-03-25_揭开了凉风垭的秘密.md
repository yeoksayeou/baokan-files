    Unveiling the Secrets of Liangfengya
　　Xia Qun
    From Songkan in Guizhou Province, heading north along the winding Sichuan-Guizhou Highway for more than forty kilometers, you arrive at Liangfengya, the throat of the Sichuan-Guizhou Highway. The Sichuan-Guizhou Railway will open a tunnel as long as eight and a half Chinese miles here, allowing trains to pass through its belly.
    Liangfengya is the great watershed of the Lou Mountain Range, reaching a height of more than 1,500 meters. Clouds swirl around the jagged, sawtooth-like mountain peaks, and several eagles circle back and forth. Winding up the highway, steep cliffs stand on both sides, and between the gaps in the rugged rocks, three or five ancient pines and weeping willows extend. The highway, inlaid with reddish-brown mountain rocks, is like strips of disheveled yellow silk, fluttering from the mountaintop to the foot of the mountain. The highway has to twist and turn through seventy-two sharp turns and steep slopes from the bottom of the mountain to climb to the top, which is why it is known throughout the country for its arduous "Seventy-Two Turns."
    The mountains and rivers here are enchanting! However, the more mountains and rivers, the more beautiful the scenery, the greater the difficulties it brings to the surveyors. It is in this fascinating spectacle of Liangfengya that our young railway surveyors have encountered "enemies" never before seen in the history of Chinese railway construction: karst caves, sinkholes, faults, and underground rivers. The surface of this rock looks very hard, but the bottom is empty. Its load-bearing capacity is very small, and it is very dangerous if such a long tunnel is built on a karst cave. Therefore, it is necessary to find a route that completely avoids these karst caves so that the train can pass safely.
    Finding these hidden "enemies" is not so easy. Surveyors must not only drill into these caves that no one has ever entered before, but also measure their area and origins. The Fifth Survey Team of the Second Design Institute of the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, which is responsible for the survey work in this area, selected a dozen young and strong lads to form a "Karst Cave Investigation Team." Most of the members of this team were "pioneers" who had been responsible for the most arduous section of the Yingxia Railway – the Dayunling survey project. They were transferred to the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway not long ago, and took on this most glorious task. They put on long rubber boots and raincoats, carried weapons for defense against animals, held gas lamps, carried safety ropes on their shoulders, and carried surveying instruments, conducting a detailed reconnaissance and search of every hill near Liangfengya.
    These karst caves vary in size. The largest, such as the Shiniulan and Liujiadapo karst caves, are four to five hundred meters long, and can hold two or three-story buildings. The small ones can only be squeezed in sideways or crawled in. There are strangely shaped stones in the caves, and stalactites like crystal columns that can be more than a fathom long. Some caves are humid and hot, making breathing difficult; some caves are filled with rain and fog, and the cold air is biting; some caves have rushing torrents and underground channels, while others have bottomless deep pools, and you can't hear an echo when you drop a stone; some caves are too high to climb, some caves plummet sharply, and the safety rope can't reach the bottom even when it is lowered dozens of meters. Some large caves are nested with small caves, and small caves lead to large caves. Some caves look like dead ends, but after squeezing through a partition wall, they suddenly become clear and open up to a new world.
    "Although we have surveyed several railways, this is the first time we have encountered such a complex terrain and geology." A member of the karst cave investigation team named Cai Guoxing excitedly told me about the discovery of the first karst cave here:
      "It was in the winter of 1955. When we were walking back after completing a day's reconnaissance work, we passed a place called Shiniulan, when suddenly a goat ran past us and plunged into a thicket of thorns. Pushing aside the branches and vines, a cave was revealed. We turned on the flashlight and walked in, but before we had gone far, we were afraid that something might happen, so we had to turn back. At that time, considering that the top of the cave was where the railway passed, we felt it was necessary to investigate.
      "In January last year, we made all the preparations and started the first exploration of the secrets of the Shiniulan karst cave. - It's really interesting, we caught two goats as soon as we stepped into the karst cave, one male and one female; they may have thought that building their 'love nest' in this place where no one would ever come was the safest thing to do, but they never thought that we would break into their tranquil life….
      "The cave was covered with pebbles and river sand, proving that there was once an underground river here many years ago. As the rock weathered and dissolved, the underground river found a new outlet. The top of the cave is more than forty meters high, and the stalactites hanging upside down from the top are like knives and swords. After walking four hundred and fifty meters, a pool of water suddenly blocked the way.
    "What should we do? We don't have any waterproof equipment. At this time, the brave Xiao Shen suddenly remembered a thrilling scene in the movie 'Taking Huashan Mountain Intelligently', and hurriedly untied the safety rope from his back, threw it up and put it on a protruding rock, grabbed the rope with both hands, and kicked his feet, his body floated into the air, trying to fly over the pool, but the pool was too wide, and before he could swing to the other side, he bounced back. Later, everyone came up with a way to connect two ladders to cross the pool.
      "Going further in, a small cave two or three meters wide was found in the steep wall of the large cave. We tied ropes to measure into the small cave, and gusts of wind blew out from the small cave. It's strange, it was wet all the way in, humid and hot; where did the wind in this small cave come from? Because the entrance of the cave was very steep, it was impossible to climb up, so we came out after measuring the big cave! However, the ins and outs of this small cave are still a question, and it would be very dangerous to set the line above it if it is not clarified.
      "Later, in another hill nearby, a sinkhole with its mouth facing the sky was found. A soft ladder of twenty-five meters long was thrown down and it didn't reach the bottom, and another eight meters was added, before it seemed to touch the ground. I held the soft ladder and moved down step by step. When I got down to twenty meters, my hands and feet were sore and weak. I wanted to whistle and ask the comrades at the entrance of the cave to pull me up, but I thought: no! The railway roadbed is nearby, and it would have too much impact if it wasn't explored clearly, so I gritted my teeth again, and finally set foot on solid ground. Just as I was about to squat down to rest for a while before starting to measure, I took a look with the flashlight, ah, how dangerous! It turned out that it wasn't the bottom yet. This was just standing on a protruding rock. After adding a few meters and measuring down, it was discovered that this small karst cave was directly connected to the Shiniulan large karst cave that we first scouted."
    Speaking of this, Cai Guoxing also breathed a sigh of relief, just like when he discovered the secrets of the karst cave at that time, "These karst caves and sinkholes are distributed so intricately in the valleys of Liangfengya. The first time we explored this karst cave, we discovered a serious situation: the roadbed of our original line was only five meters away from the top of this large karst cave. If we hadn't found them, the future harm would be unimaginable!
      "Soon, Soviet experts from the Second Design Institute came to investigate several times and believed that the karst cave problem could not be ignored and must be thoroughly investigated before the line could be determined. In late February last year, the karst cave investigation team was officially established and launched a struggle with these hidden 'enemies'." Regarding the detailed situation of investigating these karst caves, Cai Guoxing pointed to Xiao Shen beside him and said: "He participated in the karst cave investigation work from beginning to end, and has drilled through many karst caves in this area. Let Xiao Shen continue to talk!"
    Xiao Shen is named Shen Xushou. As early as in Chengdu, I was familiar with this name from their team leader. This young man, who is only twenty-one years old this year, fell in love with this profession since he was a child. When he was fifteen years old, he just graduated from elementary school in Huayang County, Sichuan Province, and couldn't wait to participate in the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, running all over the mountains and plains with his older brothers and sisters, learning how to find an ideal line for the train. In the past five years, he has traveled all over the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, Baoji-Chengdu Railway, Chengdu-Kunming Railway, Yingxia Railway…. When I looked at him with envious eyes, he shyly pushed the glasses on the bridge of his nose: "Let's go and see a few nearby karst caves first!"
    Stepping out of the door is a deep ditch, above which is the famous "Diaoshiyan" on the Sichuan-Guizhou Highway. As the name suggests, one can imagine its arduousness. Xiao Shen crossed ridges and gullies as if walking on flat ground. When he encountered a steep slope as high as his chest, he supported himself with both hands and went up. Climbing up an pass, our whole body was covered with a kind of needle-shaped grass, just like two hedgehogs; it couldn't be flicked off, couldn't be shaken off. Xiao Shen said with a smile: "We call this grass 'dear grass'. When you go back, take it off and roast it on the fire, and brush it off with a bristle brush."
      "The most interesting is the Chumipu karst cave" he pointed to the other side of the mountain and said, "The mouth of this karst cave is large and the bottom is small, very much like a funnel. When a rope of more than twenty meters is lowered, you have to walk forward seven or eight meters, and then lower it for more than twenty meters to reach the bottom. Below is a large karst cave. After walking through the large karst cave, you have to squeeze sideways through a partition wall. There is a bottomless deep pool. When you shine a light on it, the pool is full of large fish a foot long. When you pick it up and take a look, it is snow-white all over. It is said that this is because it has not seen sunlight for a long time. This kind of fish is worth studying by biologists!" "On that side," following the direction of his finger, a waterfall flowed out of a cave, "is the confluence of underground rivers from several karst caves. These karst caves and underground rivers also have a benefit. Look, in a karst cave on the mountain called Liujiadapo on the opposite side, we found an underground river that flows continuously throughout the four seasons. The terrain is very high, and the water output is enough for the locomotives of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway to use." Xiao Shen knows how big each karst cave is in this area, which century the rock layer belongs to, whether it is developing or has stopped developing… as if counting his own family treasures.
    Xiao Shen told me that in those days of exploring karst caves, everyone, in order to save time and find a safe route as early as possible, would set off with dry food as soon as it was light and after eating. At noon, they would eat dry food in the cave and continue measuring. In such a difficult environment, they did not feel it was hard, and often did not stop working until it was time to get off work. One day, it was already dark, and the family members had not seen the karst cave investigation team return. Everyone was anxiously guessing: did something happen? After waiting for a long time, the family members lit gas lamps and went to the karst cave where they were working to find them. After entering the cave and walking not far, they heard the song from the movie "Treasure Hunt in the Deep Mountains" coming from the cave:
    White clouds surround the Qilian Mountains,
    Flowers bloom on the grasslands of Qinghai,
    There are fat cattle and sheep on the grasslands,
    There are endless treasures in the deep mountains, ….
    Hearing the singing, a stone fell to the ground in everyone's hearts. And the people in the cave saw a white light outside the cave, and thought that the sun had not yet set!
    The karst cave investigation team fought here for more than forty days and nights, revealing the secrets of forty-nine karst caves of all sizes. Now, a Liangfengya tunnel over-ridge line that completely avoids the karst caves has been preliminarily determined.

    揭开了凉风垭的秘密
　　夏群
    从贵州省的松坎，沿着蜿蜒如带的川黔公路北上四十多公里，就到了川黔公路的咽喉——凉风垭。川黔铁路将要在这里开一条长达八华里半的隧道，让火车从它的腹部穿过。
    凉风垭是娄山山脉的大分水岭，高达一千五百多公尺。狼牙锯齿般的山顶上云雾横绕，几只苍鹰往来盘旋。沿着公路蜿蜒而上，两侧峭壁屹立，峥嵘怪石的缝隙间，伸出三五株古松和垂柳，那镶嵌着赤褐色山石的公路，犹如一匹匹抖乱了的黄绸，从山顶飘旋到山脚。公路从山底一直要盘旋七十二道急弯和陡坡才能爬上山顶，这就是以艰险而名闻全国的“七十二道拐”。
    这里的山水是迷人的！但是，山水越多，风景越美，给勘测人员带来的困难也越大。就在凉风垭这引人入胜的奇景里，我们年轻的铁路勘测人员却遇到了中国铁路修建史上从来没有过的“敌人”：溶洞、陷穴、断层和暗河。这种岩石表面上看来很坚硬，底下却是空的。它的承载力很小，这样长的隧道要是有一处修在溶洞上，是十分危险的。因此，必须找出一条完全避开这些溶洞的线路来，让火车安全的通过。
    要找出这些隐藏的“敌人”，并不是那么容易。勘测人员不但要钻进这些从来没人进去过的洞子，还要在洞子里测出它的面积和来龙去脉。担负这一带勘测任务的铁道部设计总局第二设计院第五勘测分队，挑选了十几个年青力壮的小伙子，组成了“溶洞调查小组”。这个小组的大部成员，就是曾经担负鹰厦铁路上最艰巨的一段——戴云岭勘测工程的“开路先锋”，他们转移到川黔铁路不久，又担负起了这个最光荣的任务。他们穿上长统胶靴和雨衣，带上防兽的武器，手提汽灯，肩背安全绳，扛着测量仪器，对凉风垭附近的每一个山头，展开了细致的侦察和搜索。
    这些溶洞有大有小，最大的像石牛栏、刘家大坡等溶洞，长达四五百公尺，洞里能盖两三层高的大楼；小的只能侧着身子挤进去或爬着进去。洞里有奇形怪状的石头，有长可盈丈的水晶柱似的石乳；有的洞里潮湿闷热，呼吸困难，有的洞里雨雾纷飞，冷气逼人；有的洞里激流奔腾，暗渠横流，有的洞里还有无底深潭，丢下石头也听不见回声；有的洞高不可攀，有的洞急转直下，安全绳吊下去几十公尺也打不到底，有的大洞套小洞，小洞又通大洞，有的洞看着已经是绝路，但挤过一道夹壁，又豁然开朗，别有洞天。
    “我们虽然勘测过好几条铁路，像这样复杂的地形和地质还是第一次遇见。”一个名叫蔡国兴的溶洞调查小组的成员，眉飞色舞地向我谈起在这里发现第一个溶洞的经过：
      “那是1955年的冬天，我们完成了一天的草测工作往回走的时候，经过一个名叫石牛栏的地方，突然从我们面前跑过一只山羊，一下子就钻进一片荆棘丛生的林子里去了。拨开树枝藤蔓，露出一个山洞来，我们打起电筒走了进去，走不多远，恐怕发生意外，只好折转来。当时考虑到洞顶是铁路经过的地方，感到有探个究竟的必要。
      “去年1月间，我们做好了一切准备工作，开始第一次探测石牛栏溶洞的秘密。——真有趣，踏进溶洞就捉住了两只山羊，一公一母；它们也许认为把‘香巢’筑在这从来不会有人来的地方是最安全的了，想不到我们却撞进来破坏了它们恬静的生活……。
      “洞里遍地是卵石和河沙，证明若干年前，这里曾经有一条暗河，随着岩石风化溶解，暗河又找到了新的出口。洞顶高达四十多公尺，顶上倒垂下来的石乳，犹如刀山剑林。走了四百五十公尺，突然出现一口水潭挡住了去路。
    “怎么办呢？我们又没有防水设备。这时候，勇敢的小沈突然想起了电影‘智取华山’中的一个惊险镜头，忙从背上解下安全绳，甩上去搭在一块凸出的岩石上，两手抓紧绳子，双脚一蹬，身子就腾空起来，企图飞越水潭，不想水潭太宽，还没甩到对岸又弹了回来。后来大家想办法把两架梯子接起来，才越过了水潭。
      “再往里走，在大洞的陡壁间又发现了一个两三公尺宽的小洞，我们系上绳索往小洞里测量，小洞里刮出股股狂风，奇怪呀，一路走进来都是湿漉漉的，潮湿而闷热；这小洞的风是从那里来的呢？因为洞口笔陡，无法往上爬，我们把大洞测量完毕就出来了！但是，这个小洞的来龙去脉还是一个疑问，要不查清楚，万一把线路定在上面就很危险。
      “后来在附近的另一个山头上，发现了一个洞口朝天的陷穴，用二十五公尺长的软梯抛下去还不到底，又接上八公尺，才似乎接触到地面。我扶着软梯一步步往下移，下到二十几公尺时，已经手酸腿软，很想吹声口哨，让洞口的同志们把我拉上去，转念一想：不行！附近就是铁路路基，不探清楚，影响太大，又咬咬牙，好容易才脚踏实地，正想蹲下来休息一会才开始测量，随手用电筒一照，啊，好危险哪！原来还没到底，这只是站在一块凸出的岩石上，再接上几公尺往下测，才发现这个小溶洞就是直通我们第一次侦察的那个石牛栏大溶洞的。”
    说到这里，蔡国兴也像当时发现了溶洞的秘密一样，松了一口气，“这些溶洞和陷穴就是如此错综复杂地分布在凉风垭一带的山谷里，第一次探测这个溶洞就发现了严重的情况：原来我们第一次的线路路基距离这个大溶洞的顶端仅五公尺，要不把它们找出来，将来的危害真是难以想像啊！
      “不久第二设计院的苏联专家们三番两次的前来踏勘，认为溶洞问题不可忽视，必须彻底查清楚才能确定线路。去年2月下旬，才正式成立溶洞调查小组，和这些隐藏的‘敌人’展开斗争。”关于调查这些溶洞的详细情况，蔡国兴指着身旁的小沈说：“他从头到尾都参加了溶洞调查工作，这一带山头的许多溶洞都钻过，小沈继续谈吧！”
    小沈，名叫沈序寿。早在成都的时候，我就从他们队长的口中熟悉了这个名字。这个今年才二十一岁的年轻人，从小就爱上了这一行。十五岁那年，在四川省华阳县的小学刚刚毕业，就迫不及待地参加了成渝铁路的建设，跟着大哥大姐们满山遍野跑，学习怎样为火车寻找理想的线路。五年来，他踏遍了成渝铁路、宝成铁路、成昆铁路、鹰厦铁路……。当我用羡慕的眼光看他的时候，他有点羞涩地托了托鼻梁上的眼镜：“我们还是先去看看附近的几个溶洞吧！”
    跨出门就是一条深沟，上面就是川黔公路上著名的“吊尸岩”，顾名思义，可以想见它的艰险。小沈翻岭越沟，如履平地，遇到齐胸高的陡坡，他两手一撑就上去了，爬上一个垭口，我们周身都缠满了一种针状的小草，活像两只刺猬；弹不下，抖不掉，小沈笑嘻嘻地说：“这种草，我们叫它‘亲爱草’，回去脱下来在火上烤烤，用鬃刷一刷就下来了。”
      “最有趣的是楚米铺溶洞”他指着山那边说，“这个溶洞口大底小，很像漏斗，用二十多公尺的绳子吊下去，往前走七八公尺，又要吊下去二十几公尺才到底，下面就是一个大溶洞、走完大溶洞，侧着身子穿过一道夹壁，有一个无底深潭，用汽灯一照，水潭里拥塞着一尺来长的大鱼，捞起一看，浑身雪白，据说这是因为长期不见阳光的原故，这种鱼很值得生物学家来考究一番哩！”“那一边，”顺着他手指的方向，从一个洞里流出一股瀑布，“是几个溶洞的暗河汇合在一起流出来的。这些溶洞、暗河也有一个好处，看吧，在对面那座名叫刘家大坡的山上的一个溶洞里，我们找到一条四季不断流的暗河，地势很高，出水量足供川黔铁路的机车用水。”小沈对这一带每一个溶洞有多大，岩层属于哪一世纪，是正在发展的或已经停止发展的……，都历历如数家珍。
    小沈告诉我，在那些探测溶洞的日子里，大家为了争取时间，提早找出一条安全的线路来，每天都是天刚亮吃了饭就带上干粮出发，中午，在洞里吃完干粮又继续测量。在这样艰苦的环境里，他们并不以为辛苦，常常到下班的时间还不收工。有一天，天已经黑了，家里的人还不见溶洞调查小组的人回来，大家不安地猜疑着：出了事吗？久等不来，家里的人就点着汽灯到他们工作的溶洞里去找，进洞没走多远，就从洞里传出了电影“深山探宝”中的歌声：
    白云环绕祁连山，
    鲜花开放在青海的草原，
    草原上有肥壮的牛羊，
    深山里有无尽的宝藏，……。
    听到歌声，大家心上的一块石头才落了地。而洞里的人们看到洞外的一片白光，还以为太阳还没有落山哩！
    溶洞调查小组在这里战斗了四十多个日夜，揭露了大大小小四十九个溶洞的秘密，现在，一条完全避开了溶洞的凉风垭隧道过岭线已经初步确定下来了。
