    Eat, Dear Robe!
    (Azerbaijani Folk Tale)
    Once, Nasreddin was invited to a wealthy man's house to attend a wedding feast. He went wearing an old robe, and they didn't even let him in the door. So, he changed into a new robe and went again. This time, the situation was different: the hosts greeted him very politely and warmly, and led him to the seat of honor. When the dishes were served, Nasreddin lifted his lapel over the plate and said:
    "Eat, dear robe! Eat, dear robe!"
    "What are you doing?" the hosts asked in surprise.
    "I want to treat my robe! You see, it is it, not me, that you are so respectfully feasting. So, whomever you respect, please let them eat!" (Translated by Liu Hua and Yang Guanglu)

    吃吧，敬爱的长袍！
    （阿塞拜疆民间故事）
    有一次，纳斯列金被请到一个富贵人家参加婚宴去了。他穿着一件旧长袍去的，人家连大门都没让他进去。于是，他换了一件新长袍就又去了。这一次情形就不同了：主人们非常客气而盛情地接待了他，并把他让到了上坐。到了上菜的时候，纳斯列金就把自己的衣襟提在菜盘上并说道：
    “吃吧，敬爱的长袍！吃吧，敬爱的长袍！”
    “您这是干什么哪？”主人们惊奇地问道。
    “我要款待我的长袍！要知道，你们如此尊敬地宴请的是它，而不是我。那么，尊敬谁，就请谁吃吧！”（刘骅　杨光禄译）
