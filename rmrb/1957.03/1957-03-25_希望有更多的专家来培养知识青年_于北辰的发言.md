Title: Hoping for More Experts to Cultivate Intellectual Youth - Yu Beichen's Speech

During the first and second plenary sessions, committee members Wu Han and Sun Fuling delivered speeches on the situations of social youth and industrial and commercial youth, respectively. Thanks to the care of the Party and the government, great changes have taken place in those areas. Now, I would like to say a few words about intellectual youth.

Since liberation, the ranks of intellectual youth have greatly expanded. Currently, there are over 400,000 university students alone. They are very diligent in their studies, especially after the Party Central Committee called for advancing towards science, their enthusiasm for learning has become even higher. However, on the other hand, due to the needs of socialist construction, the number of students has grown too quickly, and the growth of teaching staff has not kept pace. The proportion of teaching assistants is very high, which inevitably affects the quality of cadre training.

As a result of the long-term rule of the reactionaries, China's science and culture are backward, and there are very few experts of all kinds. In recent years, the scientific research institutions of the Academy of Sciences and industrial departments seem to have developed too quickly and vigorously, which relatively deepens the shortage of teachers in universities. At the same time, some experts, because they have become presidents, vice-presidents, deans, directors of scientific research, department heads, or heads of teaching and research sections, no longer undertake teaching and scientific research work, which is also detrimental to improving the quality of cadre training.

Now, the teaching reform has basically come to an end, and this year's enrollment task has been reduced. The conditions for better carrying out scientific research and improving teaching quality in universities are now more mature.

Therefore, in order to satisfy the ardent desire of intellectual youth to advance towards science and better serve the country, and in order to train socialist construction cadres of higher quality, I suggest:

First, I hope that experts in scientific research institutions—researchers, academicians, institute directors, department directors, presidents… whether full or deputy, all those who can spare the time should go to universities to lead teaching and research sections, open up new research bases, guide graduate students, guide graduation theses (designs), set up lectures, teach basic courses… and together with experts in universities, lead young teachers and students to advance towards science forcefully and accurately, thereby discovering young scientists, selecting young scientists, and cultivating young scientists among the vast number of young people, strengthening the ranks of scientific forces, forming various schools of thought, and striving to change the backward state of our country's scientific work as soon as possible.

Second, I hope that experts in universities who also hold administrative positions will, without exception (the quantity can vary according to specific circumstances), actively participate in teaching and scientific research work. "If you don't practice for three days, your hands get clumsy; if you don't speak for three days, your mouth gets rusty." It is difficult to pick up what you have lost. Experts, you can no longer "cool down." Today, China has pitifully few experts, and wasting the strength of experts is inexcusable to the people.

Mencius said, "It is one of the joys of life to obtain the world's talents and educate them." Experts in all positions, why not come! Here, on behalf of the vast number of intellectual youth, I extend my 미리 greetings to the experts who are about to go to universities to concurrently engage in teaching and scientific research work, and to the experts who are returning to the lecture hall and the laboratory!

### 希望有更多的专家来培养知识青年　于北辰的发言

　　希望有更多的专家来培养知识青年
　　于北辰的发言
    在第一次和第二次全体会议的时候，吴晗委员和孙孚凌委员曾分别就社会青年和工商青年的情况发了言。由于党和政府的关怀，在那里情况已发生了很大的变化。现在我想就知识青年讲几句话。
    解放以来，知识青年队伍是大大地扩大了，目前单在校大学生就超过了四十万。他（她）们对学习是很努力的，特别是党中央号召向科学进军以后，他（她）们底学习热情更高了。但是另一方面，由于社会主义建设需要，学生数量发展过快，师资力量生长不及，助教比例很大，结果势必影响培养干部的质量。
    反动派长期统治的结果，使中国科学文化落后，各种专家都很少。几年来科学院和产业部门底科学研究机构似乎又发展得过快过猛了一些，这就相对地加深了高等学校的师资紧张情况。同时有些专家，因为作了正副校院长、教务长、科学研究处长、系主任或教研组主任，就不担任教学工作和科学研究工作，也是不利于提高培养干部质量的。
    现在，教学改革已基本上告一段落，今年招生任务已减少，在高等学校更好地开展科学研究工作，提高教学质量的条件已更成熟。
    因此，为着满足知识青年向科学进军，以便更好地报效国家的热烈愿望，为着培养质量更高的社会主义建设干部，我建议：
    第一、希望在科学研究机构的专家们——研究员、学部委员、所长、部主任、院长……无论正副，凡有可能挤出时间的，到高等学校去领导教研组、开辟新的研究据点、指导研究生、指导毕业论文（设计）、设讲座、教基础课……和在高等学校的专家一起，率领青年教师和学生有力地准确地向科学进军，从而在广大青年中去发现青年科学家，挑选青年科学家，培养青年科学家，壮大科学大军队伍，形成各种各样的学派，争取尽快改变我国科学工作的落后状态。
    第二、希望在高等学校兼任行政职务的专家们无例外地（数量可根据具体情况，有多有少）积极地参加教学工作和科学研究工作。“三天不打手生，三天不讲口生”，丢生了要捡起来是困难的。专家们，不能再“冷起来了”。今天中国专家是少得可怜的，浪费专家力量是不能见谅于人民的。
    孟子说，得天下英才而教育之一乐也。各个岗位上的专家们，盍兴乎来！在此，我代表广大知识青年，预先向即将走向高等学校兼任教学工作和科学研究工作的专家们和重新走上讲堂和实验室的专家们致敬！（附图片）
