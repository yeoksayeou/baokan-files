Xinhua News Agency, March 15th: According to a report by the German News Agency: The Leipzig Spring International Fair closed on the evening of the 14th after being held for twelve days. Over the past twelve days, a total of 662,000 visitors from 78 countries visited the fair. This year's fair, whether in terms of the number of participating exhibitors and visitors or the trade volume agreed upon at the fair, was the largest since the war. The German Democratic Republic alone reached foreign trade agreements with other countries at the fair amounting to 2,176,000,000 marks.

During the Leipzig Fair, the Chinese Book Exhibition Department, located in the collective exhibition building of various countries' books in the center of Leipzig, was crowded with visitors every day. Original Chinese paintings by artists such as Qi Baishi, Wang Xuetao, and Yu Fei'an were quickly pre-sold. The number of Chinese painting reproductions published by Rong Bao Zhai, such as Xu Beihong's horses and Qi Baishi's shrimp, were ordered in the thousands. Nearly 10,000 copies of the "Collection of Paintings by President Sukarno" were requested. In addition, Chinese children's books, Chinese painting bookmarks, and Chinese records were also widely welcomed. (Photo attached)

    来比锡春季国际博览会闭幕
    展出单位参观人数和贸易额突破战后纪录
    我国美术作品在展览会中受到广泛欢迎
    据新华社15日讯  据德意志通讯社报道：来比锡春季国际博览会在举行了十二天之后在14日晚间闭幕。在过去十二天中，共有七十八个国家的六十六万二千个参观者参观了博览会。今年的博览会无论从参加展出的单位和参观的人数来看，或是从博览会上达成协议的贸易额来看，都是战后以来，最大的一次。仅德意志民主共和国在博览会上同其他国家达成协议的对外贸易额就达到二十一亿七千六百万马克。
    在来比锡博览会举行期间，设在来比锡市中心各国图书集体展览大厦中的中国图书展览部每天都挤满了观众。齐白石、王雪涛、于非暗等画家的国画原作很快地就被预售一空。荣宝斋出版的国画复制品如徐悲鸿画的马，齐白石画的虾被订购的数量以千计。“苏加诺总统藏画集”被要求供应的数量近万册。此外，中国的儿童读物、国画书签和中国唱片也受到广泛的欢迎。（附图片）
