    Tianjin Municipal Handicraft Production Cooperatives achieved great success in utilizing waste materials last year.
    
    The utilization of waste materials includes over twenty industries such as daily-use hardware, vehicles, wrought iron, nail making, tools and agricultural machinery, cotton woven goods, wooden sundries, rope making, felt making, vehicle fittings, bamboo, rattan, palm, grass, rubber, etc. More than 50% of the products in the daily-use hardware, vehicle, wrought iron, tools, and agricultural machinery industries are directly manufactured using waste materials. Various hemp rope cooperatives used waste rope ends and baling twine to produce a large number of hemp ropes, processing over 45,000 jin for the Municipal Federation of Cooperatives alone. Paper products cooperatives used waste paper edges to manufacture over 27,000 jin of paper rope. Vehicle fittings cooperatives used waste yarn ends and waste tire strips to weave over 8,600 horse halters and over 8,800 waist sashes. Various cotton woven goods and cotton processing cooperatives used lint boards, lint sticks, and car front bowls from cotton mills to process many kinds of products, including over 20,000 pockets, 22,800 cotton blankets, and many others like wadded cotton, quilt covers, shoulder pads, and sofa cushion cotton.

    Many waste materials that were once considered unusable have also found appropriate uses. For example, over 3 million jin of offcuts resembling firewood from various electric saw factories under the Materials Supply Department were utilized by various wooden sundries cooperatives as raw materials.

    Some cooperatives have also utilized waste materials to manufacture many new products. For example, the First Daily-Use Metal Supply and Marketing Cooperative used offcuts from three-cent large buckets to manufacture grinding wheel cutting knives, replacing imported diamond bits and solving the problem of imported material shortages. Furthermore, the First and Second Waste Wool Production Cooperatives used waste materials like coarse wool from wool weaving factories to weave wool vests and sweaters at very low prices. The Rubber Cooperative used waste plastic bags to make hair ties for women, which are both economical and elegant.

    Utilizing waste materials for production not only solved raw material shortages but also reduced product costs and expanded the public accumulation of the cooperatives.

    天津手工业社充分利用废料
    本报讯  天津市手工业生产合作社，去年利用废料有很大成绩。
    利用废料生产的有日用五金、车具、锻铁、造钉、工具农械、棉织杂品、木制杂品、制绳、制毡、车马具、竹藤棕草、橡胶等二十多个行业。日用五金、车具、锻铁、工具农械等行业的产品，有50％以上都是直接用废料制造的。各麻绳社利用废绳头、打包绳等废料制成了大批麻绳，仅给市联社加工的就达四万五千多斤，纸制品社利用废纸边制造纸绳达二万七千多斤。车马具等社利用废纱头和废轮带编制马笼头八千六百多个，搭腰八千八百多条。各棉织杂品、棉花加工社用棉纺厂下来的绒板、绒棍、车前碗加工出许多种产品，其中仅口袋即达两万余条，棉毯二万二千八百条，其他如絮棉、被套、垫肩棉、沙发垫棉等也很多。
    有许多认为不能用的废料，也找到了适当用途。如物资供应处各电锯厂下来的类似劈柴的三百多万斤下料，都被各个木制杂品社作为原料加以利用了。
    有些合作社还利用废料，制造了许多新产品，如第一日用金属供销社利用三厘三大桶下料，制造砂轮割刀，代替了进口金钢钻，解决了进口料的困难。再如第一、二废毛等生产社利用毛织厂的麻毛等废料织成毛背心、毛衣，价钱很便宜。橡胶社用废塑胶袋做妇女扎发辫绳，既经济、又大方。
    利用废料生产，不但解决了原料困难，而且降低了产品成本，扩大了合作社公共积累。
