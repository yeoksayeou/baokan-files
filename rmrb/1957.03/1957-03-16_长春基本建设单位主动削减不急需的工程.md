Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, March 14th. Basic construction units in Changchun City, in the spirit of "postponing construction of projects that can be postponed, reducing construction of projects that can be reduced, and not building projects that don't need to be built," have proactively reduced projects that had already been approved for construction by higher authorities. According to statistics from six units, including the Changchun Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Northeast People's University, and the Jilin Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau, the reduced projects have saved the state a total of more than 4.9 million yuan in construction funds.

The Changchun Railway Transportation Machinery School of the Ministry of Railways and the Jilin Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau originally planned to build more than 28,000 square meters of office buildings, warehouses, and school buildings, but now they have decided not to build them. These two units have saved the country a total investment of 2,495,500 yuan. The Changchun Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences originally planned to build a new high-voltage laboratory this year, which would require a state investment of 1.28 million yuan, but after careful research, it was decided to renovate the existing laboratory and cancel the new construction project. As a result, only 30,000 yuan of state investment is needed.

    长春基本建设单位主动削减不急需的工程
    新华社长春14日电  长春市各基本建设单位，本着“可缓建的缓建，可少建的少建，可不建的不建”的精神，对上级已经批准修建的工程项目，主动地进行了削减。据中国科学院长春机电研究所、东北人民大学和吉林省森林工业管理局等六个单位已经削减的工程项目统计，共给国家节省了建设资金四百九十多万元。
    铁道部长春铁路运输机械学校和吉林省森林工业管理局原计划共修建二万八千多平方公尺的办公楼、仓库和校舍，现在都决定不修了。这两个单位共节省国家投资二百四十九万五千五百元。中国科学院长春机电研究所原来打算在今年新建一个高压试验室，需国家投资一百二十八万元，但是经过细致研究以后，决定改建原有试验室，取消新建项目，结果只要国家投资三万元就够了。
