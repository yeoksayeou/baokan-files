The first year of agricultural cooperativization in Shanxi Province demonstrated the great power of agricultural cooperatives to guarantee increased production and overcome disasters, and farmers see agricultural cooperativization as the only bright road. Of course, due to a lack of experience, there are still some shortcomings in production planning and business management, but these can be overcome.

At this meeting, I listened to Premier Zhou's report, Vice Premier Li's explanation on the Second Five-Year Plan, and Vice Chairman Chen's work report on the Standing Committee. I fully support these reports and am willing to work hard in my position to implement them.

I am here as a representative of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. I would like to talk about my understanding of advanced agricultural cooperativization based on my inspection tours last year and other practical observations and experiences.

During my two inspection tours last year, in the first and second halves of the year, I inspected six advanced agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Taiyuan City. In the second half of the year, I also inspected disaster relief work in Xiaodian District of Taiyuan City, which was severely affected by disasters. I was also invited to participate in the Shanxi Provincial Agricultural Cooperative Representatives Conference held from February 6th to 13th this year. From these inspections and meetings, I deeply realized the superiority of advanced agricultural cooperativization, which truly provides the tremendous conditions for increased production and disaster resistance that individual farmers, mutual aid teams, and elementary cooperatives cannot possess. Last year was the first year that Shanxi achieved advanced cooperativization, but it encountered serious disasters. Most areas were continuously threatened by various disasters such as floods, waterlogging, insect plagues, and hailstorms. As a result, these serious natural disasters were overcome by the great power of advanced cooperativization, and unprecedented increases in production were achieved.

Why does advanced cooperativization have such tremendous superiority? Based on my own actual inspections and experiences, I believe that the main reason is that after advanced cooperativization, labor, land, capital, and other major means of production can be used centrally and allocated in a unified manner. On the one hand, labor is rationally organized and utilized, greatly enhancing the enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers and improving labor utilization. On the other hand, it can adapt to local conditions and fully utilize the potential of the land. Moreover, there are sufficient strength and conditions for increasing fertilizer application, building water conservancy projects, improving farming techniques, developing diversified economies, and carrying out various agricultural capital construction projects.

Last year, I inspected a Yuejin Agricultural Cooperative in Jinci Town, Taiyuan, which is a famous high-yielding rice cooperative. Their average yield per mu of rice fields last year reached 1,032 jin, with the highest yield reaching 1,420 jin, an increase of 24% compared with the elementary cooperative in 1955, and almost more than double the yield in the year before liberation. The main reasons why they achieved such high yields are: First, they improved labor utilization and stimulated the enthusiasm of the members. Their male laborers averaged 250 workdays per person, an increase of 13.6% compared with the elementary cooperative in 1955. In 1955, only more than 30 women went to the fields, averaging only 50 workdays per person, while last year the number of women going to the fields increased to 89, averaging 70 workdays per person. Due to the rational use of labor, they not only improved farming techniques and achieved intensive cultivation, but also used surplus labor to carry out large-scale measures such as improving soil, repairing marshland, renovating canals, and expanding cultivated land area. Second, they implemented a farming system adapted to local conditions and adopted rational close planting, increasing the number of rice seedlings planted by more than 5,000 per mu. In the past, because farmers were unable to invest, they could only apply a small amount of lime fertilizer per mu, but now they can use a large amount of chemical fertilizer. Therefore, they guaranteed increased production and achieved an unprecedented harvest.

The superiority of advanced cooperativization is not only evident in advanced agricultural cooperatives, but also in general agricultural cooperatives. For example, the Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative in Xincheng District, Taiyuan, which I inspected last year, is a second-class cooperative and one of the worst. They made mistakes in transplanting rice seedlings last year, resulting in a reduction of 40,000 jin, but they still guaranteed increased production. Their total output last year was 229,000 jin more than the standard output of 1,050,000 jin. I also inspected a vegetable production cooperative. This cooperative suffered two hailstorms last year, but still achieved a bumper harvest. Their vegetable output averaged 10,900 jin per mu, an increase of 21.24% compared with 1955. Their grain output averaged 309 jin per mu, an increase of 73% compared with 1955. This fully demonstrates that under the conditions of advanced cooperativization, no matter what difficulties are encountered, it is possible to guarantee increased production.

In the struggle against natural disasters, advanced cooperativization has shown even more amazing power. When we arrived at Nanwangming Village and Xin Village in Xiaodian District, Taiyuan, which were the most severely affected by disasters last year, they had already successfully overcome the natural disasters and were confidently engaged in various labor production activities. There was no trace of the disaster. Why could they do this? The local farmers loudly replied to us that in addition to the government's timely relief, the main reason was that they "benefited from advanced cooperativization." They gave me a series of figures, explaining that the farmers in Xiaodian District dug 15 water diversion ditches in the disaster relief struggle, drained water from 12,000 mu of fields, and carried out large-scale destruction, replanting, pest control, and drainage work. At the same time, they also organized a large number of laborers to carry out more than 100 kinds of sideline production. They said that this kind of large-scale production and disaster relief work would have been absolutely impossible without the realization of advanced cooperativization. Therefore, some farmers said with full confidence: "Advanced cooperativization has great power, and we are not afraid of any disasters."

Advanced cooperativization can guarantee increased production and overcome disasters, thus guaranteeing the continuous increase of farmers' income and the continuous improvement of their lives. For example, the Yuejin Agricultural Cooperative in Jinci Town mentioned above achieved an income of 3 yuan and 24 fen per workday last year. The average income from agricultural production for each household was 770 yuan, plus the income from sideline occupations reached more than 850 yuan. Among the 168 member households in the whole cooperative, except for one household whose income was less than in 1955 due to frequent illnesses and fewer workdays, all the others increased their income compared to 1955. Generally, income increased by 25%-30% compared to 1955.

Due to the rational organization and use of labor, not only can male and female farmers with labor power give full play to their enthusiasm, but also the widowed, orphaned, lonely, disabled, and other people who lack labor power in rural areas have been given appropriate work and proper arrangements. The "five guarantees" policy has been conscientiously implemented in all the agricultural cooperatives we have seen. Agricultural cooperatives have also given appropriate assistance and care to those who cannot maintain their lives by relying on labor income. Therefore, many farmers believe that agricultural cooperatives are even closer than their homes, and a common atmosphere of working together and taking the cooperative as their home has become widespread. The problem of livelihood for the widowed, orphaned, lonely, disabled, and other people that society has never been able to solve in the past has been basically solved after the realization of advanced agricultural cooperativization.

Therefore, after advanced cooperativization, farmers regard agricultural cooperatives as their "lifeline." At the recent Shanxi Provincial Agricultural Cooperative Representatives Conference, I heard farmer representatives say with confidence: "Reason doesn't lie in high-sounding words, and high mountains can't block the sun. Whether advanced cooperatives are good or not, the facts are there for all to see." Based on my own actual observations and experiences, I think this statement is not an exaggeration at all.

Precisely because of this, after the full-scale advanced cooperativization was realized in Shanxi Province in the early spring of last year, all of the more than 18,000 advanced cooperatives were consolidated. Many farmers who were still holding a wait-and-see attitude in the early spring of last year also asked to join advanced cooperatives one after another in the autumn. Therefore, nearly 1,000 elementary cooperatives were transformed into advanced cooperatives in the autumn of last year, and more than 15,000 out of more than 20,000 individual farmers outside the cooperatives joined the cooperatives.

The vast majority of farmers in Shanxi have unswervingly embarked on the road of advanced cooperativization. They regard this road as the only bright road for them to get rid of bankruptcy and poverty and enjoy a prosperous life forever. Therefore, they say: "No one can stop the road we have chosen." In this Shanxi Provincial Agricultural Cooperative Representatives Conference, all representatives expressed their full determination and confidence to guarantee a bumper harvest this year. Moreover, they are all full of confidence that the twelve-year agricultural production development targets proposed in the National Agricultural Production Development Program (Draft) will definitely be successfully realized, and some existing agricultural cooperatives have already exceeded the targets proposed in this program. Currently, more than 160 advanced cooperatives in Shanxi Province have achieved an average grain yield of more than 400 jin per mu, of which about one-third are in mountainous areas.

Now the facts have fully proved that the unparalleled superiority of advanced agricultural cooperativization has been significantly demonstrated. It is the only correct road for all farmers to move towards a prosperous life. Therefore, I suggest that our national and local CPPCC organizations should widely mobilize public opinion and social forces to vigorously support the advanced agricultural cooperativization that the vast number of farmers unanimously aspire to, so as to promote the further consolidation and development of advanced agricultural cooperativization throughout the country.

Of course, there are still many shortcomings and problems in the work of cooperativization. Based on what I have seen in the inspections, there are still some problems and shortcomings in the planning of production, the system and methods of business management, and the promotion of high-yield crops. However, no matter what problems and shortcomings there are, they are generated in the process of progress, and achievements are always the main thing. As the example of Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative in Xincheng District, Taiyuan, mentioned above, although the output was reduced due to errors in the work, the superiority of advanced cooperatives was still demonstrated. From the perspective of total output, a bumper harvest was still achieved. Moreover, the realization of advanced cooperativization has only been one year, and experience is still lacking, so shortcomings are naturally inevitable. We believe that as long as we earnestly rely on the masses under the leadership of the Party to implement the principles of democratic management of cooperatives and running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, any shortcomings and problems can be overcome and solved.

    农民向往的道路—农业合作化
    支应遴（列席）的发言
    山西实现农业合作化第一年，农业社就表现了保证增产战胜灾害的巨大力量，农民把农业合作化看成是唯一光明的道路。当然，由于还缺乏经验，在生产规划、经营管理等方面还有一些缺点，但这是可以克服的。
    在这次会议上听了周总理的报告、李副总理关于第二个五年计划的说明和陈副主席关于常委会的工作报告。我完全拥护这些报告，并愿在我的工作岗位上为其贯彻实现而努力。
    我是代表政协山西省委员会来列席这次会议的。我想就去年的下乡视察以及其他的实际观察和体会，谈谈我对农业高级合作化的认识。
    我去年上半年和下半年的两次视察中，共视察过太原市郊区的六个高级农业社，后半年还在太原市受灾较严重的小店区视察过救灾工作，今年2月6日至13日山西召开的全省农业社代表会议我也被邀参加。从这些视察和会议中，使我深深体会到农业高级合作化的优越性，确是单干农民以及互助组和初级社所不能有的巨大的增产条件和抗灾力量。去年是山西实现了高级合作化的第一年，但却遇到了严重的灾害，绝大部分地区连续遭受了洪灾、水灾、涝灾、虫灾和雹灾等各种灾害的严重威胁，结果，这些严重的自然灾害都被高级合作化的巨大力量所战胜了，而且还获得了空前未有的增产。
    为什么高级合作化能有这样巨大无比的优越性呢？根据我自己的实际视察和体会，我认为主要就是由于高级合作化以后，劳动力、土地、资金和其他主要生产资料能够集中使用和统一调配的原因。一方面劳动力得到了合理的组织和使用，大大地发挥了广大农民的劳动积极性，提高了劳动利用率；另一方面能够因地制宜，充分发挥土地的潜在力；而且在增施肥料，兴修水利，改进耕作技术，发展多种经济以及进行各种农业基本建设等等方面，也都有了充分的力量和条件。
    去年我在太原晋祠镇视察过一个跃进农业社，是一个有名的水稻千斤丰产社。他们去年的稻地每亩平均产量达到一千零三十二斤，最高产量达到一千四百二十斤，比1955年初级社时提高了24％，比解放前一年的产量差不多超过二倍。他们所以得到这种丰产成绩，主要原因就是：第一，提高了劳动利用率，发挥了社员的劳动积极性。他们的男劳动力平均每人做到二百五十个劳动日，比1955年初级社时提高了13.6％。1955年妇女下地的只有三十多人，每人平均只做到五十个劳动日，而去年妇女下地的就增加到八十九人，平均每人做到七十个劳动日。由于劳动力的合理使用，他们不仅改进了耕作技术，做到了精耕细作，而且还利用剩余劳动力进行了大规模的改良土壤、修垫沼泽地和整修渠道、扩大耕地面积等一系列的基本建设措施。第二，实行了因地制宜的耕作制度，采用了合理密植，平均每亩增加插秧五千多株。过去因为农民无力投资，每亩只能施少量的石灰肥，现在则能大量使用化学肥料。因此，他们就保证了增产，取得了空前的丰收。
    高级合作化的优越性不仅在先进的农业社如此，就是在一般的农业社也表现得非常显著。例如，我在去年视察的太原新城区新华农业社，是一个二类社中较次的社，他们在去年试种插秧中还犯了错误，减产四万斤，但结果仍然保证了增产，他们去年的总产量比三定标准产量一百零五万斤还多产二十二万九千多斤。我还视察过一个蔬菜生产合作社，这个社去年遭受了两次雹灾，但仍获得丰收，他们的菜蔬产量每亩平均达到一万零九百斤，比1955年增产21.24％，他们的粮食产量每亩平均三百零九斤，比1955年增产73％。这就充分说明在高级合作化的条件下，不论遇到什么困难，都是可能保证增产的。
    在自然灾害的斗争中，高级合作化更表现了惊人的力量。我们去年到达太原遭灾最严重的小店区南王名村和辛村视察时，他们已经胜利地克服了自然灾害，满怀信心地在进行各种劳动生产，受灾痕迹已经一点也没有了。为什么能够这样呢？当地农民响亮地回答我们说，除了政府的及时救济外，主要就是“沾了高级合作化的光”。他们给我举出一连串的数目字，说明小店区农民在救灾斗争中共挖了十五道退水沟渠，在一万二千亩田地里抽了水，进行了大规模的毁种、补种、杀虫和排水、抽水工作，同时还组织了大批劳动力，进行了一百多种副业生产。他们说，这种大规模的生产救灾工作，如果不是实现了高级合作化是绝对不可能做到的。因此，有的农民满怀信心的说：“高级化，力量大，什么灾害也不怕。”
    高级合作化能够保证增产，战胜灾害，因而也就保证了农民收入的不断增加和生活的不断改善。如上述晋祠镇的跃进农业社去年每个劳动日的收入就达到三元二角四分，平均每户从农业生产方面得到的收入就有七百七十元，加上副业收入就达到八百五十元以上，全社一百六十八户社员中，除了一户因经常患病，做得劳动日较少，收入不如1955年以外，其余都比1955年增加了收入，一般收入比1955年增加到25％—30％。
    由于劳动力的合理组织和使用，不仅有劳动力的男女农民都能充分发挥劳动积极性，而且农村中的鳏寡孤独和老弱残废及其他缺乏劳动力的人，也都得到了适当的工作和妥善的安排，“五保”政策在我们所看到的各个农业社中都得到认真的贯彻执行，依靠劳动收入不能维持生活的人，农业社也给了适当的帮助和照顾。因此，许多农民认为农业社比他的家还亲，同心协力以社为家的风气已经普遍形成，过去社会上从来无法解决的鳏寡孤独和老弱残废等人的生活出路问题，在农业高级合作化实现以后已经基本上得到了解决。
    因此，农民们在高级合作化以后，把农业社当做是他们的“命根子”。在最近山西召开的农业社代表会议上，我听到农民代表们理直气壮地说：“有理不在高言，山高挡不住太阳，高级社究竟好不好，有事实在那里摆着呢。”这种说法，根据我自己的实际观察和体会来看，我认为是一点也不算过分的。
    正因为如此，所以山西全省在去年春初实现了全面的高级合作化以后，所有一万八千多个高级社便都巩固下来了，许多在去年春初还抱着等一年再看的观望的态度的农民，在秋后也纷纷要求加入高级社，于是在去年秋后又有将近一千个初级社转为高级社，并在社外的二万多户个体农民中又有一万五千多户入了社。
    山西的绝大多数农民坚定不移地都已经走上高级合作化的道路，他们把这条道路当做他们永远摆脱破产、贫困和享受富裕生活的唯一光明的道路。因此他们说：“看中了的路谁也挡不住。”在这次山西全省农业社代表会议中，所有代表都表示了充分的决心和信心，要保证今年农业的大丰收。而且他们都满怀信心地认为全国农业生产发展纲要（草案）所提出的十二年农业生产发展指标，一定能够胜利实现，而且现在已经有的农业社超过了这个纲要中所提出的指标。现在山西全省已经出现一百六十多个高级社的粮食平均亩产四百斤以上，其中约有三分之一以上是属于山区的。
    现在事实已经完全证明，农业高级合作化的无比优越性已经显著的表现出来了，它是全体农民走向富裕生活的唯一正确的道路，因此，我建议我们全国各级政协组织应该广泛动员社会舆论和社会力量，大力支持广大农民所一致向往的农业高级合作化，以促进全国农业高级合作化的进一步巩固和发展。
    当然在合作化工作中，还有不少的缺点和问题存在着。根据在视察中所看到的，在关于生产的规划方面、经营管理的制度和方法方面，以及在推广高产作物等方面，都还存在着一些问题和缺点。但是，不论什么问题和缺点，都是在前进中产生出来的，而成绩总是主要的。正如前面所述太原新城区新华农业社的例子一样，虽然因为工作中错误而减产，结果还是显示了高级合作社的优越性，从总的产量来说，仍然取得了丰产，何况高级合作化的实现，才仅仅只有一年，经验还很缺乏，缺点自然是不可避免的。我们相信，只要在党的领导下认真依靠群众贯彻民主办社和勤俭办社的方针，任何缺点和问题都是可以克服和解决的。（附图片）
