Strange Subsidy
　　Wang Min

　　One day, a guest holding banknotes came to the Finance Section of the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Electrical and Mechanical Industries. As soon as he entered the door, he said, "I'm here to pay back the money, giving you the money." Then he put a stack of banknotes on the counter of the Finance Section. The comrade in charge of the accounts in the Finance Section looked up and recognized the guest as Director Li of the Tianjin Agricultural Machinery Factory. He quickly flipped through the ledger, looking for Director Li's loan account. After flipping through all the ledgers, he still couldn't find that Director Li had borrowed money here. The comrade in charge of the accounts said to him in surprise, "You don't owe us money!" The director smiled wryly and walked away, muttering something under his breath.

　　Director Li, who didn't owe the Bureau of Electrical and Mechanical Industries money, why did he go to the Bureau of Electrical and Mechanical Industries to pay back the money? It turned out that at the end of last year, the Tianjin Agricultural Machinery Factory had a surplus of employee hardship subsidies. In principle, this sum should be handed over in full, or transferred to the 1957 account as this year's employee hardship subsidy. However, Director Li had other plans in mind. He believed that this sum could neither be handed over nor transferred, and he should find a way to spend it. So he asked the chairman of the trade union (who was also the director of the labor insurance committee) to immediately convene a meeting of the labor insurance committee to discuss the handling of this surplus. At the meeting, Director Li criticized the chairman of the trade union for not being bold enough in using employee hardship subsidies, always being stingy, like a miser. He vigorously promoted his own difficulties. He said that he used to owe more than 1,000 yuan in foreign debt and his life was extremely difficult, but the trade union had never given him any subsidies. He particularly emphasized that he now owed the Bureau of Electrical and Mechanical Industries more than 500 yuan, and he had been unable to repay it despite repeated demands. After the meeting, he immediately wrote a subsidy application to the chairman of the trade union, requesting a subsidy of 565 yuan first. The chairman of the trade union was somewhat afraid because he had been criticized by the director at the meeting, so he approved the director's request for a subsidy without careful review.

　　Is Director Li's family life really difficult? People in the factory knew that his income was 114 yuan per month, his wife's monthly income was more than 50 yuan, and there was only one ten-year-old child at home. For a family of three, each person had an average of more than 50 yuan for living expenses per month. Moreover, nothing unexpected had happened in his family for several years. How could he owe so much debt?

　　Li Guangjun, the party branch secretary of the factory, saw that Director Li got this money so easily, and his eyes turned red. He didn't even write a subsidy application, and asked the chairman of the trade union for 190 yuan. Two section chiefs learned about this incident and felt that it was an opportunity to take advantage of, so they went to Director Li and asked him to give them subsidies. Director Li clearly knew that these two section chiefs did not have difficult lives, but if he was not upright himself, how could he correct others? As a result, he also subsidized them 70 yuan each. This surplus hardship subsidy was spent according to Director Li's intentions.

　　Paper can't wrap fire. The truth about Director Li's debt was quickly discovered. It turned out that his statement about owing the Bureau of Electrical and Mechanical Industries more than 500 yuan was completely false. Later, at a meeting, a cadre sarcastically and jokingly asked Director Li, "You received a hardship subsidy, why haven't you gone to the Bureau of Electrical and Mechanical Industries to pay back the money?" Director Li's cheeks flushed immediately, and he mumbled, "I'll pay it back when I have time." The cadre continued, "Director Li is too busy with work. Give me the money and let me pay it back for you!" Director Li said, "No, this is a personal matter, it's better for me to go myself, I'll go after the meeting." So, after the meeting, Director Li had to pretend to go and pay back the money, holding a stack of banknotes in a serious manner.

　　After these people received this subsidy, some bought leather coats, some bought leather shoes, and some secretly deposited the subsidy in the bank to earn interest!

　　This so-called subsidy is actually not much different from embezzlement in disguise. (Attached picture)

    奇怪的补助
    王民
    一天，在天津市机电工业局财务科里，来了一个手拿钞票的客人，一进门就说：“我是来还账的，给你们钱”，随即把一叠钞票放在财务科的柜台上。财务科管账的同志抬头一看，这位客人原来是天津农业机械厂的李厂长，就连忙翻账本，寻找李厂长借款的户头。账本都翻过了，始终没有发现李厂长在这里借过款。管账的同志惊奇地向他说：“你不欠我们钱呀！”这位厂长苦笑了一下，嘴里嘟囔着不知说了句什么话就走开了。
    不欠机电局钱的李厂长，为什么到机电局去还账呢？原来是这么回事：去年年底，天津农业机械厂余下一笔职工生活困难补助费。按理，这笔款应当如数上交，或者把它转到1957年账上，作为今年职工困难补助费用。可是李厂长的心里却另有打算，他认为这笔款既不能上交也不能转账，应当想办法花出去。于是他叫工会主席（兼劳保委员会主任）马上召开劳保委员会议，讨论这笔余款的处理问题。会上李厂长一面批评工会主席在使用职工困难补助费上不够大胆，老是扣扣缩缩，像个守财奴；一面大肆宣传起自己的困难来。他说他过去欠下一千多元的外债，生活异常困难，但工会却从来没有给他进行过补助。并特别强调地说，他现在还欠机电局五百多元，人家几次催要他都无力归还。会完之后，他随即给工会主席写了一个申请补助的条子，要求先给他补助五百六十五元。工会主席由于在会上挨了厂长一顿批评，很有些害怕，所以对厂长要求补助的理由没有进行认真的审查就照批了。
    李厂长的家庭生活是不是真正有困难呢？厂里的人都知道他的收入每月是一百一十四元，他的爱人每月收入五十多元，而家里只有一个十岁的小孩子。全家三口人，每月每人平均有五十多元的生活费。而且几年来他家里又没有出过什么意外的事情，怎么能欠这么多的债呢？
    厂的党支部书记李广钧看到李厂长这笔款来得很容易，眼也红了起来，连申请补助的条子也没有写，就向工会主席要了一百九十元。有两个科长知道了这件事，也觉得是个沾便宜的机会，马上去找李厂长，要求给他们补助。李厂长虽然明明知道这两个科长的生活并不困难，但己不正，焉能正人。结果也给他们每人补助了七十元。这笔剩余的困难补助费就这样按照李厂长的意图花出去了。
    纸里总是包不住火的。李厂长欠债的真实情况很快就被人察觉了。原来他说欠机电局五百多元的事完全是假的。后来在一次会议上，有个干部半讽刺半开玩笑地问李厂长：“你领了困难补助费，怎么不见你去机电局还账呢？”李厂长的脸颊顿时红了起来，随便吱唔了一声“我有空就还”。这个干部接着说：“李厂长工作太忙，你把钞票给我，让我代你去还吧！”李厂长说：“不，这是个人私事，还是我自己去好，会开完了我就去。”于是在会后李厂长不得不拿着一叠钞票煞有介事地假装着去还账了。
    这些人拿到了这笔补助费之后，有的买了皮大衣，有的买了皮鞋，还有的把补助费偷偷地存在银行里，让它生利息呢！
    这种所谓补助，其实同变相贪污并没有多大区别。（附图片）
