Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 6th – Heilongjiang Province, located in the northernmost part of our country, plans to increase paddy fields by 100,000 hectares this year. This is one of the important measures Heilongjiang Province is taking to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

In order to develop 100,000 hectares of paddy fields, agricultural cooperatives throughout the province are now working hard to build small-scale water conservancy projects. More than 3,000 small-scale water conservancy projects that started last winter have now completed 68% of the total project volume, and are expected to be fully completed by the end of April. Various localities have also inspected and repaired the original projects. More than 90% of the irrigation projects for these 100,000 hectares of paddy fields are constructed independently by agricultural cooperatives.

This year, the total area of paddy fields in Heilongjiang Province will reach 400,000 hectares. From both sides of the Mudanjiang River in the south to the Heilongjiang River in the north, every county in the province grows paddy fields. This year, various localities will adopt various advanced experiences to increase the yield per unit area of paddy fields. Dry direct seeding, water spot seeding, and water strip seeding are all effective seeding methods that increased production last year, and many agricultural cooperatives will adopt these seeding methods according to their own conditions this year. To meet the needs of promoting new seeding methods, the area of rice fields sown with new agricultural tools this year will increase from 40,000 hectares last year to about 100,000 hectares.

In order to develop paddy fields, various counties have successively set up training classes for agricultural cooperative paddy field technicians to teach paddy field management techniques, so that each agricultural cooperative with paddy fields has paddy field technicians. Various localities have also organized farmers to visit, interview, and learn techniques from agricultural cooperatives with experience in rice cultivation, and some agricultural cooperatives have also hired Korean farmers with experience in paddy field cultivation to serve as paddy field technical guidance.

    黑龙江采取重要增产措施
    今年开发水田十万公顷
    新华社哈尔滨6日电　位于我国最北部的黑龙江省，今年计划增加水田十万公顷，这是黑龙江省今年争取农业大丰收的重要措施之一。
    为开发十万公顷水田，现在全省各地农业社正在紧张地兴修小型水利工程。去年冬季动工的三千多处小型水利工程，到现在已经完成了总工程量的68％，预计到4月底可以全部完工。各地将原有的工程也做了检查和补修。这十万公顷水田的灌溉工程，90％以上是农业社自力施工的。
    黑龙江省今年水田总面积将达到四十万公顷，从南部的牡丹江两岸直到北部的黑龙江边，全省每个县都种有水田。各地今年将采用各种先进经验，以提高水田单位面积产量。旱直播、水点播、水条播等都是去年行之有效的能增产的播种方法，今年有很多农业社将根据自己的条件采用这些播种方法。为适应推行新播种法的需要，今年使用新农具播种的稻田将从去年的四万公顷增加到十万公顷左右。
    各县为开发水田，先后开办了农业社水田技术员训练班，传授水田管理技术，使每个有水田的农业社都有水田技术手。各地还组织农民到种水稻有经验的农业社参观、访问和学习技术，一部分农业社还聘请了有水田栽培经验的朝鲜族农民担任水田技术指导。
