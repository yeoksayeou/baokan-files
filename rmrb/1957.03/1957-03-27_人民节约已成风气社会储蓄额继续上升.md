　　People's Thrift Has Become a Trend, Social Savings Continue to Rise
　　(Our Newspaper) According to the latest statistics from the National Bank: As of March 10th, the total amount of urban savings deposits nationwide has reached 2,286.6 million yuan, an increase of 51.22 million yuan compared to the end of 1956 (the total amount of deposits in the same period in 1956 decreased by 32.73 million yuan compared to the end of 1955). Among them, in Hunan, Jiangxi and other provinces, the increase in deposits from February 10th to March 10th this year accounted for more than one-tenth of the original deposits of each province.
　　Because the broad masses of people have a further understanding of participating in social savings and supporting national construction, it is estimated that the number of households participating in savings has reached about 22 million. On average, one out of every five people in urban areas nationwide has a bank deposit. This phenomenon of increased balances during the off-season for savings is rare in the past few years. At the same time, with the masses actively participating in social savings, the situation of tight supply of certain consumer goods in the country has also been alleviated to a certain extent. For example, the sales volume of cotton cloth in Beijing in January has decreased by more than 20% compared to the end of last year, and the sales of certain high-end and expensive commodities have also decreased significantly. Many cities with rising savings balances have experienced similar situations in terms of material supply.
　　(Our Newspaper) The savings deposits of people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have increased significantly. As of early March, the people's savings deposits in the autonomous region had reached 102.88 million yuan, completing the first quarter's target of increasing 6.5 million yuan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target. In the past two months, due to the development of the increase production and practice economy campaign, the number of savings deposits in various places has continued to increase. For example, Dushanzi and Kelamayi increased by 1.8 million yuan compared to the end of last year. Tacheng Prefecture's savings increased by 1.69 million yuan, equivalent to more than twice the planned task. The total amount of savings deposits of workers, staff and citizens in Urumqi increased by 1.48 million yuan compared to the end of last year, equivalent to four times the increase last year. In the past, the balance of savings deposits decreased around the Spring Festival, but this year the savings deposits have been increasing.

　　人民节约已成风气社会储蓄额继续上升
    本报讯　全国广大人民节约储蓄的风气正在迅速形成和发展。据国家银行最近统计：到3月10日为止，全国城市储蓄存款总额已达二十二亿八千六百六十万元，比1956年底增加了五千一百二十二万元，（1956年同时期的存款总额较1955年底存款共减少三千二百七十三万元。）其中湖南、江西等省今年2月10日到3月10日的一个月当中，存款增加数占各省原有存款数的十分之一以上。
    由于广大人民对参加社会储蓄，支援国家建设有了进一步的认识，目前参加储蓄的户数，据计算已经达到二千二百万户左右。在全国城镇中，平均每五个人中就有一个人在银行有存款。而这种储蓄淡季余额增加的现象，在过去几年来是少有的。同时，在群众积极参加社会储蓄的前提下，国家某些消费品供应紧张的情况也有了一定程度的缓和。例如，北京市1月份的棉布销售量，较去年年底已经减少20％以上，某些高级贵重的商品的销路也大量的减少了。许多储蓄余额上升的城市，在物资供应方面都出现了类似的情况。
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民储蓄存款显著增加。截至3月上旬，自治区人民储蓄存款已达到一亿二百八十八万元，提前和超额完成了第一季度增加六百五十万元的任务。在这两个多月中，由于增产节约运动的开展，各地储蓄存款的数字不断增加。如独山子和克拉玛依两地比去年年底增加了一百八十万元。塔城专区储蓄增加了一百六十九万元，相当于计划任务的两倍多。乌鲁木齐市职工和市民的储蓄存款总额比去年年底增加了一百四十八万元，相当于去年增加数的四倍。往年在过春节前后储蓄存款余额是下降的，但是今年的储蓄存款一直在上升。　（自治区人民银行储蓄管理处）
