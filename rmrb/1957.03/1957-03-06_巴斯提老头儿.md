Old Man Basti
		Fán Liánxīn
	July arrived, bringing with it a scorching heat wave. The Gobi Desert became a sweltering oven.

	“Captain, you drink! There are still two mouthfuls of water left!” An old Uyghur man, speaking broken Chinese, rushed to offer his water bottle to Huang Lei, the captain of the petroleum geological survey team.

	Huang Lei was desperately thirsty, but seeing that the old Uyghur man was also parched, just opening his mouth, he said, “No, Elder Basti, you should drink it. Look at your age, you’re so thirsty…”

	Old Basti was the survey team’s guide. He was already fifty-eight years old, his forehead etched with deep wrinkles, and his hair and beard seemed to be covered in silver frost. That day, he and Captain Huang Lei were walking ahead as the "advance team," with more than a dozen comrades following behind. As they walked, they needed to understand some of the stratigraphic contact relationships. Early in the morning, Basti had suggested camping at Yema Spring that night, saying that there were many springs there, making it a perfect place to settle down and cook. He even joked to everyone, “Twenty years ago, I was a hunter and hunted at Yema Spring. In the past, herds of wild horses drank there. Maybe we’ll even encounter them this time!” Basti was a kind, simple, and honest old man, and since he had been acting as a guide since May, he had not made any mistakes, so his suggestion was immediately unanimously approved by everyone.

	Unfortunately, the day was particularly hot, and the scorching sun made them feel hot and itchy all over. Before two o'clock in the afternoon, Huang Lei had already drunk all the water in his water bottle, and Basti only had two mouthfuls of water left. He always wanted to give those two mouthfuls of water to the captain, but the captain always refused to accept. “Alright!” Basti said helplessly, “It’s fine if you don’t drink it, anyway, Yema Spring is almost here. When we get there, we’ll have a good, hearty drink!”

	Things took an unexpected turn. When the two of them arrived at Yema Spring, they couldn’t find a single spring. A look of worry immediately appeared on Basti’s face. Had they taken the wrong road? Or had he misremembered the place? No, that couldn't be. Weren’t those three sand dunes still there, albeit taller than they were twenty years ago? Wasn't the small riverbed formed by the spring water still there, even though it had dried up? Basti stood on the sand dune and carefully looked around in all directions, then said with certainty, “That’s it, this is Yema Spring!”

	“But where did the water go?” Basti couldn’t figure out the reason.

	Huang Lei was even more anxious at this moment, “What if the comrades behind us don't have any water when they arrive? Can we really let everyone not drink or eat? How will tomorrow's work proceed?…” A series of questions flashed through his mind.

	When Basti saw the captain’s anxious expression, his heart ached as if it were being pricked by needles. He remembered the words of the staff of the People’s Committee when he left Hami County: “We can't let the Uyghur people down, we must support the treasure hunters sent by Chairman Mao.” Thinking of this, he felt even more uncomfortable and couldn't help but say to Huang Lei: “Captain, I’m sorry to you, I’m sorry to everyone, I didn’t guide the way well, I didn’t find the water.”

	Huang Lei didn’t know how to answer. After a moment of silence, he said: “Don’t be sad, it's not your fault. The spring water here may have disappeared due to geological changes.”

	Basti didn’t give up, he was determined to find water. He asked the captain to wait for him in place, saying that he would be back soon. Basti walked forward along the old riverbed covered with dust, sand, and gravel. After walking for about a mile, he found a patch of green grass growing there. Based on his past experience, there must be water wherever green grass grows. He immediately pulled up the grass, preparing to dig down. He had no tools, so he had to endure the pain and use his bare hands to dig through layers of sand and pebbles. His fingers were bleeding, but he didn't care. After digging two feet deep, he finally found water. At this moment, he jumped up like a young man, shouting loudly: “Captain, there’s water!…”

	More and more water seeped out, and soon the entire pit was filled. Before long, the water also turned clear. Huang Lei ran over at this moment, took Basti’s hand, and said in a Uyghur phrase that Basti had taught him, “Ekerk, ko’r (thank you)!”

	As night was about to fall, those dozens of comrades all arrived. After they heard the captain introduce the story of Basti finding water, they all rushed to shake hands with Basti, praising him and thanking him.

	Basti was so excited that he couldn’t speak, and his original smile reappeared on his simple face.

    巴斯提老头儿
    樊廉馨
    7月，炙人的热流来了，戈壁滩成了一个酷热的大蒸笼。
    “队长，你喝吧！还有两口水呢！”一个操着不大流利的汉话的维吾尔族老头，拿着水壶，抢着给石油地质普查队队长黄磊喝。
    黄磊渴得要命，但他看见这位维吾尔族老头也渴得只是张着口，就说：“不，巴斯提老人家，你应该喝。你看你这样大的年纪，渴得成了这样子……”
    老头儿巴斯提是普查队的向导。他已经五十八岁了，额上刻满了深深的皱纹，头发和胡子上也好像挂满了银霜。这天，他和黄磊队长是作为“先遣部队”在前面走的；后面还有十几个同志。他们一面行路，一面要了解一些地层接触关系。一早出发时，巴斯提建议今晚在野马泉住宿，他说野马泉有很多的泉水，在那里安家，在那里做饭是再好不过了。他还幽默地向大家说：“二十年前，我是个猎人，在野马泉打过猎。过去成群的野马在那里饮水，说不定，这回我们还能遇到呢！”巴斯提是个善良、纯朴、厚道的老头儿，打从5月份担任向导以来，没有出过差错，所以他的建议立即得到了大家的一致赞成。
    不凑巧，这一天特别炎热，烈日晒得他们俩浑身都热辣辣地发痒。不到下午两点钟，黄磊已把他水壶里的水喝光了，巴斯提的水壶也只剩下了两口水。他总要把这两口水让给队长喝，可是队长总是不接受。“好吧！”巴斯提无可奈何地说，“不喝也行，反正野马泉快到了，到那里我们再好好地痛饮吧！”
    事情出乎意料之外，他们两个人到了野马泉，却找不到一个水泉。巴斯提的脸上顿时出现了一副愁容。是走错了路？还是记错了地方？不，不是。那三个沙丘不是都在吗，不过比二十年前更高了。那泉水流成的小河道，至今不是也在吗，不过它已经干涸了。巴斯提站在沙丘上，又仔细地向四面眺望了一下，然后肯定地说：“就是，这就是野马泉！”
      “可是水跑到那里去了呢？”巴斯提猜不透原因。
    黄磊这时更焦急，“后面的同志来了没有水怎么办？难道能让大家不喝水、不吃饭？明天的工作怎么进行？……”一系列的问题都浮现在他的脑海里。
    巴斯提看见队长焦急的神情，心里就像针扎一样地痛。他想起离开哈密县的时候，人民委员会的工作人员向他叮咛的话：“不能给我们维吾尔族人丢脸，一定要支援好毛主席派来的探宝人。”想起这些，他内心越发感到难受，不由地向黄磊说：“队长，我对不起你，对不起大家，我没有把路带好，没有找到水。”
    黄磊不知怎样回答才好，沉默了一会儿，他说：“别难过，这不能怪你，这里的泉水可能因地质上的变化而没有了。”
    巴斯提并没有死心，他一定要去找水。他让队长在原地等候着他，说自己一会就回来。巴斯提沿着那被尘沙和砾石复盖了的旧河道向前走，走了有一里路，就发现有一堆碧绿的青草长在那里。根据他过去的经验，凡是长青草的地方一定有水。他立即拔掉了青草，准备往下挖。没有工具，只好忍痛用双手扒开一层层的沙土和石子，手指出血了，他也顾不得。挖了二尺深，终于见到了水。这时，他高兴得像年轻人一样地跳了起来，高声地喊着：“队长，有水了！……”
    水越渗越多，不大一会，全坑都渗满了。没多久，水也变成清澄澄的。黄磊这时跑来了，拉着巴斯提的手，用巴斯提教给他的一句维吾尔族话说：“埃克克，扣尔（谢谢）！”
    夜幕将要降临的时候，那几十个同志都到了。当他们听到队长介绍了关于巴斯提找水的故事以后，都抢着和巴斯提握手，称赞他，感谢他。
    巴斯提兴奋得说不出话来，淳朴的脸上又浮现出他原来的笑容。
