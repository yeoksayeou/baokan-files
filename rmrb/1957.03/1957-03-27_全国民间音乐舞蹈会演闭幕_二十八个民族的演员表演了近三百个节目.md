Xinhua News Agency, March 25th: The Second National Folk Music and Dance Performance concluded today.

In his closing speech, Liu Zhiming, Deputy Minister of Culture, gave a high evaluation of the performance. He said that the programs participating in the performance were healthy and simple in content, lively and diverse in form, and basically inherited the excellent traditions of our national and folk art. This performance was a great improvement compared to the First National Folk Music and Dance Performance held in 1953, which also shows that mass amateur art activities in various places have been further developed in recent years; new achievements have been made in the excavation and sorting of national and folk art.

Liu Zhiming pointed out in his speech that carrying out mass art activities is to enrich the cultural life of the broad masses, so it must be rich and diverse: it is necessary to inherit traditional folk art and accept new art forms to meet the requirements of all aspects of the masses. When carrying out mass art activities, it is especially necessary to advocate thrift and oppose extravagance and waste, and never compare with professional groups in terms of ostentation. To carry out rural mass art activities, we must first proceed from the characteristics of the countryside, the busy and idle seasons of production, and the interests of the masses, and combine them with production tasks as much as possible, following the principle of "amateur and voluntary."

Liu Zhiming also pointed out that the excavation and sorting of national and folk art is an indispensable part of the prosperity of our people's art. We want to create a new socialist national culture, which is impossible without national heritage, and traditional folk art may be contaminated with some unhealthy things in the old society, which requires us to work more carefully and never take crude methods.

Finally, Liu Zhiming asked the representatives participating in the performance to be active members of local mass art activities after returning, so as to enrich the cultural life of the people.

Sa Kongliao, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, also spoke at the closing ceremony. He hoped that people of all ethnic groups would work together to create a new socialist national culture.

Xu Shuying, a representative of the actors participating in the performance, also spoke.

The performance started on March 10th. More than 1,300 amateur actors from twenty-eight ethnic groups performed nearly 300 music and dance programs.

　　全国民间音乐舞蹈会演闭幕
　　二十八个民族的演员表演了近三百个节目
    新华社25日讯　第二届全国民间音乐舞蹈会演在今天闭幕。
    文化部副部长刘芝明在闭幕式上所作的讲话中，给予这次会演以很高的评价。他说，参加会演的节目，内容健康朴素，形式活泼多样，基本上继承了我国民族、民间艺术的优秀传统。这次会演比1953年举行的第一届全国民间音乐舞蹈会演大会已有很大提高，这也说明了几年来各地群众业余艺术活动有了进一步的开展；在发掘整理民族、民间艺术工作上有了新的成就。
    刘芝明在讲话中指出，开展群众性的艺术活动是为了丰富广大群众的文化生活，所以一定要丰富多样：既要继承传统的民间艺术，也要接受新的艺术形式，这样才能满足各方面的群众的要求。开展群众艺术活动，特别要提倡节约，反对铺张浪费，切不可在排场上向专业团体看齐。开展农村群众艺术活动，首先要根据农村特点，生产忙闲，群众爱好，尽可能地结合生产任务，在“业余、自愿”原则下进行。
    刘芝明同时指出，发掘和整理民族、民间艺术是繁荣我国人民艺术事业不可缺少的组成部分。我们要创造社会主义的民族的新文化，离开了民族遗产是不可能的，而传统的民间艺术在旧社会里可能沾染一些不健康的东西，这要求我们更细致地去做工作，绝不能采取粗暴的作法。
    最后，刘芝明要求参加会演的代表们回去以后，作当地群众艺术活动的积极分子，使人民群众的文化生活更加丰富起来。
    中华人民共和国民族事务委员会副主任萨空了也在闭幕式上讲话。他希望各民族人民共同为创造社会主义的民族的新文化努力。
    参加会演的演员代表徐淑英也讲了话。
    这次会演是从3月10日开始举行的。共有二十八个民族的一千三百多位业余演员表演了近三百个音乐舞蹈节目。
