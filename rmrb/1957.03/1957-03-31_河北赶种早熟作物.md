Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 30th — Agricultural cooperatives in Hebei Province are rushing to plant early-maturing crops such as spring wheat, peas, and potatoes, in order to harvest a batch of grain as early as possible this year. According to statistics from thirty-seven counties up to the 26th, more than 1.29 million mu of early-maturing crops have already been planted in a concentrated effort.

This year, after the planned planting area for early-maturing crops in Hebei Province is completed, and adding the more than 30 million mu of winter wheat planted last autumn, the summer harvest area will approach 45 million mu, accounting for more than one-third of the province's total cultivated land area. It is estimated that the yield of these crops can reach about 5.5 billion jin.

　　河北赶种早熟作物
    新华社保定30日电  河北省各农业社正在突击种植春小麦、豌豆、马铃薯等早熟作物，以便今年及早收获一批粮食。据三十七个县截至26日止的统计，已经突击种下早熟作物一百二十九万多亩。
    今年河北省早熟作物播种面积按计划完成以后，加上去年秋季播种的三千多万亩冬小麦，夏收面积将接近四千五百万亩，占全省耕地总面积的三分之一以上。预计这些作物的产量可以达到五十五亿斤左右。
