A Brotherly Ethnic Group in Northwestern Hunan, Southwestern Hubei, and Southeastern Sichuan - Joint Statement by Xiang Da and Pan Guangdan
Based on our inspection work in the mountainous areas of northwestern Hunan, southwestern Hubei, and southeastern Sichuan in the summer and winter of 1956, we propose the following suggestions regarding ethnic work.

Regarding this vast mountainous area, to which we might as well add the northeastern corner of Guizhou, allow us to first make a historical clarification. For the past two to three thousand years, this region has been the area where the ancient Ba people and their descendants have lived and been most active. The areas where the Ba people and their descendants once spread were originally much wider than this, but from the Eastern Han to the Northern and Southern Dynasties, those outside this area had basically become indistinguishable from the Han people. Only the descendants of the Ba people in this four-province border area gradually lost their original ethnic characteristics and ethnic consciousness since the Sui and Tang Dynasties, due to the continuous penetration of the Central Plains regime and culture.

Generally, the descendants of the Ba people along the Yangtze River in Sichuan and Hubei provinces lost their characteristics the earliest, especially on the north bank; the era was the Sui and Tang Dynasties. Next were the basins south and north of Dongting Lake and west of Yi, the Li River basin, the banks of the Yuan River, and the banks of the Qianjiang River in Sichuan Province; the era was the Song and Yuan Dynasties. We say "basin" in some cases and "banks" in others for a reason. This area is mountainous, with many high mountains around 2,000 meters above sea level. The county seats are 700-800 feet high, or 300-400 feet low. The major rivers and their tributaries are rocky and have dangerous shoals, and are mostly not navigable. Therefore, the power of the Central Plains rulers could often only maintain the points and lines along the major rivers. The vast remote mountainous areas have consistently been held by the descendants of the Ba people, with limited changes. Next is the northwestern corner of Hunan Province, that is, the area west of Chenyuan and north of the Youshui River; the Qingjiang River basin in Hubei Province, including a small part of the Yichang Special Zone and most of the Enshi Special Zone; the southeastern corner of Sichuan Province and the northeastern corner of Guizhou Province; the era was as late as the Ming and Qing Dynasties. For example, the Central Plains rulers' regime was finally established in Qianjiang County in Sichuan Province and several counties in northeastern Guizhou Province in the Ming Dynasty. As for the four or five counties in the northern part of the current Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Hunan Province, the six southern counties of the Enshi Special Zone in Hubei Province, and Shizhu, Youyang, and Xiushan counties in the Fuling Special Zone of Sichuan Province, county administrations were established only during the "Reform of Native Chieftains" in the Yongzheng and Qianlong periods of the Qing Dynasty, totaling only 220 years to this day.

According to historical records, in addition to the already recognized Miao and Gelao ethnic groups, there should also be descendants of the Ba people with sufficient characteristics and ethnic consciousness in this area.

Starting in 1950, shortly after the announcement of the ethnic policy, a group of people called "Tujia" appeared in the northwestern part of Hunan Province. Subsequent historical research traced their origins to the ancient Ba people from various aspects, confirming that they were descendants of the Ba people.

How many people are there in the "Tujia" ethnic group? This is still a question today. In the counties of northwestern Hunan Province, the number of people reported successively has exceeded 300,000 by October of last year. Recently, it was said that it has increased to 500,000. In Laifeng and Xuanen in Hubei, and Xiushan in Sichuan, the number of people reported has also exceeded 50,000. We do not know whether there are any cases of reporting in Guizhou. It is estimated that there may be up to one million "Tujia" people in Hunan Province, combining the situations in the four provinces. This may not be a fact, but it also shows that the total population of the "Tujia" is more than the number currently reported; it also shows that many "Tujia" people did not report truthfully, but filled in "Han ethnicity."

The "Tujia" people of Hunan Province have been making requests to affirm their status as a brotherly ethnic group since 1950. After investigation and research, the government finally accepted their request in October 1956. Although it has not been officially announced, it has been announced locally. The joy and excitement they have expressed in the past three or four months are indescribable. But we must also admit that the resolution of this issue has been delayed for too long, and this delay has also caused some losses to our work. In Hubei and Sichuan, fewer "Tujia" people have reported their ethnicity than in Hunan, and the demands are not as urgent as in Hunan. Although the provincial leadership has also noticed this issue, it seems that they have not yet made a clear statement of recognition.

This leads us to the first suggestion we want to make.

I. The Issue of Publicity and Education on Ethnic Policies

We are not familiar with the situation in other ethnic areas, but in the areas inhabited by the "Tujia" people or other descendants of the Ba people, this publicity and education work has clearly not been done well enough. The reason why the issue of the "Tujia" identity in Hunan Province has been delayed for so long; the reason why we have not been able to make any clear statements regarding the "Tujia" in Sichuan and Hubei provinces to this day; and the reason why a large part of the "Tujia" people in these provinces are not daring to easily reveal their ethnic identity, some reporting very late, and some not reporting at all - we believe the reason lies here.

The role of publicity and education on ethnic policies is two-sided: one side is for the brotherly ethnic groups, and the other side is for the Han ethnicity.

First, let's talk about the side for the brotherly ethnic groups. In recent years, the recognition of a brotherly ethnic group requires two conditions: one is that it objectively has sufficient ethnic characteristics, such as concentrated living areas, common language, customs, beliefs, etc. The second is subjective ethnic consciousness and demands. We seem to believe that if a group of people possesses these conditions, they will naturally make ethnic demands. Once they are made, we must of course study and handle them; otherwise, we believe that since they have no demands, we don't need to handle them. Such a view neglects an important fact, that is, some ethnic groups have clear demarcations, large populations, obvious characteristics, little historical development crossing, and shallow influence from the Han ethnicity; while other ethnic groups are the opposite. For the former type of ethnic group, the problem is obvious. Even if they do not make demands on their own, we will handle and recognize them. The latter type is different. The problem is not obvious, and it is not easy for them to make demands automatically, or even not understand what ethnic demands are all about.

For this latter type of ethnic group or possible ethnic group, we do not seem to have considered that they are in the following situation: under the accumulated power of Han chauvinism for thousands of years, they have extremely deep concerns about exposing their ethnic identity. They even "want" to be Han people, at least to the extent that they cannot be distinguished from Han people on the surface. Therefore, first of all, they hide their inherent characteristics, at least in situations where Han people are present, they no longer speak their own language, no longer wear their own clothes, and no longer perform their customs and religious rituals. Secondly, the prolonged inability to freely express objective characteristics will inevitably lead to the increasing weakening of subjective consciousness. This situation, of course, cannot be changed by a single liberation, and can only be changed through the influence of sufficient publicity and education on ethnic policies. Only after the situation changes will they automatically express the inherent demands that they have accumulated in their hearts.

Regarding the ethnic demands of the "Tujia" people, in Hunan Province, only a few people initially proposed them automatically. Later, after these few people publicized them within their own ethnic group, more and more people dared to admit their ethnic identity. It is estimated that there may be 60,000 people in Laifeng County, but only more than 3,000 people initially dared to register. For four years, the number of "Tujia" people registered in Xuanen County has remained at just over 1,700, while the county leaders admit that the actual number is more than this. Last year, on National Day, a "Tujia" farmer from Shidi District in Xiushan County was invited to Chengdu as a representative to attend the celebrations. He firmly refused to go, saying that he was a "Han person" and could not represent them. The county leaders reminded him that "your brother has recently admitted to being 'Tujia'," and he then admitted it and agreed to go to Chengdu. There are at least three townships with "Tu ethnic groups" in Youyang County, one of which can still speak the "Tu language," but there have been no registered cases to date. Pengshui County has always had "Tulao ethnic groups," and the Tuo surname alone has thousands of households, but no one dares to admit that they belong to this ethnic group. These examples are enough to show that we have not done a good job in publicizing ethnic policies. The county leaders of many counties we have visited also admit that they have been busy restoring local order and arranging production work in recent years, and this aspect has indeed not been done well enough. Some even frankly admit that before we talked to them, they had not thought that there might be non-Han ethnic components in their local area.

The significance of publicity and education on ethnic policies for the Han ethnicity is even greater than what has been said above, because most of those who implement ethnic policies are Han cadres. Regarding the issue of ethnic demands, the significance of this kind of education, for the brotherly ethnic groups, is to dare to expose themselves and make demands, as has been said above, and for Han cadres, it is to be brave in discovering facts and accepting demands. A Han cadre who has not received sufficient ethnic policy education cannot but be a Han chauvinist. He uses the Han standard to measure non-Han people. He only pays attention to the similarities between non-Han people and Han people, and ignores their differences. As mentioned above, non-Han people, under the long-term pressure of Han chauvinism, often hide these differences. So in his view, they are undoubtedly Han people. Of course, he cannot see the role of this pressure, because he himself is part of this pressure. Even if he occasionally discovers some special things, he must explain them away, saying that these characteristics are local, belong to the scope of folklore, and do not belong to the scope of ethnology; or that they are manifestations of the mixture of Han and non-Han ethnicities, people are mixed, languages are mixed, and therefore these characteristics have been produced, etc.! In short, he believes that even if such a group of people has demands, it is impossible for them to be a single ethnic group.

On the issue of the "Tujia" in Hunan Province, we have indeed discovered people with such ideological situations and such opinions among the ethnic work cadres of the Han ethnicity. Some Han cadres do not even understand what ethnicity is. When talking about "ethnicity," they often use the word "race." Such a mistake in terminology also shows that we have not done a good enough job in publicizing ethnic policies among Han cadres, and precisely because it is not enough, Han chauvinist thought has not been eliminated, thereby causing unnecessary delays in the resolution of the "Tujia" issue.

At the recent enlarged meeting of the Supreme State Council, we heard Chairman Mao's twelve-point instructions, one of which was that Han chauvinism must be thoroughly eliminated. We believe that this elimination work must start with doing a good job in publicizing and educating about ethnic policies. After listening to the instructions, and combining them with the "Tujia" issue that we have come into contact with, and thinking about it, we are confident that we have some new insights, so we dare to put this forward as a suggestion for the government's reference.

II. The Issue of Establishing a "Tujia" Autonomous Region

After the "Tujia" people in northwestern Hunan are accepted as a brotherly ethnic group, the next thing to be resolved is the issue of regional autonomy. According to our understanding, there are three different opinions among the "Tujia" people on this issue. One is to unite with the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture; the vast majority of the "Tujia" population lives within the boundaries of the four northern counties under the trusteeship of the Miao Autonomous Prefecture, and has a long history of living and cooperating with the Miao ethnicity. Therefore, regional autonomy should be jointly handled. The second is to separate from the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture and become a separate "Tujia" autonomous region. The reason is that the two ethnic groups have their own characteristics, their residential areas are adjacent to each other, and there are even some overlaps. The historical development has also caused emotional estrangement. Although they are basically united at present, some distance still exists in reality. These two opinions are limited to Hunan Province. The third is that the "Tujia" autonomous region should include some "Tujia" residential areas in Sichuan and Hubei provinces bordering Hunan. This, of course, also advocates separating from the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture.

Our opinions are:

(1) The "Tujia" regional autonomy within Hunan Province should be established first, because the conditions in many aspects have matured, and because their demands have been put forward for many years. As for those within Hubei and Sichuan, it may be appropriate to slow down a little; because in these two provinces, how many "Tujia" people there are, and how large the areas where they are concentrated are, still need us to do some publicity and investigation work before we can initially confirm them. Only after confirmation can we start.

(2) The relationship between the "Tujia" autonomous region to be established in Hunan and the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, which has already been established, whether to separate or merge, must be seriously considered. We believe that separation may be more appropriate than merging. We studied the history of this area and found that there has been a long-term estrangement between the Miao and "Tu", and this estrangement was created by the Central Plains rulers. It can be said that since the early Eastern Han Dynasty, the Central Plains rulers have consistently used the ruling class of the "Tujia" ancestors to control all the non-Han people in the local area, the main group of which belongs to the Miao-Yao system; from the late Tang and Five Dynasties, this control has become more specific. People belonging to the Han ruling class have "entered" this area, "Tujia-ized" themselves first, and then controlled the Miao people by riding the "Tujia"; the so-called "Tusi" system was implemented during the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Until the "Reform of Native Chieftains" during the Yongzheng period of the Qing Dynasty, almost all of the large and small "Tusi" were borne by "Tujia" people, and they frequently "restricted" and suppressed the local Miao people on behalf of the Central Plains rulers; generally, the "Tusi" were landlords and military officers, while the Miao people were tenants and soldiers. The former were the rulers, and the latter were the ruled. For two thousand years, they have lived together on the surface, but in reality, there have been many contradictions.

Strictly speaking, this historical contradiction exists between the "Tujia" ruling class and the "Tujia" people and the Miao people, but in the pre-liberation era, which did not understand the principle of class contradictions, it always seemed that the contradiction existed between the "Tujia" and the Miao people, that is, class contradictions were completely regarded as ethnic contradictions. Although this view is wrong, it is an objective existence. Only seven or eight years have passed since liberation, and it still continues to exist to this day. The Miao cadres and comrades we came into contact with during the inspection mostly expressed indifference and unwelcome to the ethnic demands of the "Tujia" and even to the investigation personnel sent by the government for this purpose. We believe the reason lies here. They have concerns, worrying that the rule of the "Tujia" may make a comeback.

We believe that this wrong view and attitude has also affected our local administration, causing the issue of the "Tujia" ethnic demands to be delayed for too long. A local leading comrade (Han ethnicity) said to us, "Before liberation, the 'Tujia' oppressed the Miao people in the same way as the Hakka (i.e., Han people). Can you let the 'Tujia' be the same as the Miao people?" The implication is that the "Tujia" should not be allowed to be accepted as a brotherly ethnic group like the Miao. The "Tujia" issue has been delayed in this way. And this unnecessary delay has inevitably aroused a sense of displeasure on the side of the "Tujia" people, undoubtedly adding to the estrangement that has already existed in history.

These facts are unfortunate, but they are facts after all, historical facts, and also facts that are still being reflected today. We believe that when considering the issue of separation or merger of the Miao and "Tu" regional autonomy, it is necessary to fully consider it. Joint autonomy allows them to cooperate more closely, thereby eliminating past estrangement, and it is easier to make overall plans and adjustments for the economic development of the same region, which is of course good. But whether such a consideration is comprehensive, whether it takes into account how much the possibility of this close cooperation is at the present stage, and whether the possibility of close cooperation in the future would be greater if each were to carry out its own autonomy, are all still worth studying.

(3) For the "Tujia" regional autonomy, whether it is separated or merged with the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, we believe that before making a formal decision, there must be a lot of consultation. Don't be afraid of trouble, don't be afraid of spending a little more time. It doesn't matter if the rice is late if you have the rice. Since they have been invited to acknowledge it, they must be autonomous in the end. We think that the "Tujia" people will not disagree with this. First, there must be full consultation between the Miao and "Tujia". Whether it is good to merge or separate, it is certainly good to merge if it is possible, but do not force it. If it is forced to merge, it is better to separate. Secondly, the two sides of the "Tujia" people who advocate separation and merger must also fully and repeatedly consult. We understand that most of the "Tujia" people who advocate separation are those who have made more efforts to run around and appeal for the affirmation of their ethnic identity in recent years, while most of those who advocate merger are those who have not been very concerned about this issue and have worked in the administrative organs at all levels of the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture in the capacity of "Han nationality" for many years. It is impossible for there to be no distance in thought and emotion between these two sides of people. This distance must also be eliminated through consultation. If the consultation is not enough, and a hasty and one-sided decision is made to separate or merge, that is obviously not good. We ask for two points here. One is that the Hunan local administration should vigorously assist the progress of this consultation, so that all parties with different opinions can fully contact each other, freely discuss, and debate to their hearts' content, and finally make the different opinions basically converge. The second is that comrades from all parties with different opinions should break down prejudices, engage in consultations calmly and peacefully, and at the same time trust our government with all their hearts. On the basis of consultations, a conclusion that is in line with the policy and satisfies all parties will definitely be reached in the end.

III. The Issue of the Formal Names that the "Tujia" and the "Tujia" Autonomous Region Should Have

This is also a topic currently under discussion. Some older "Tujia" people and those who know a little about the origins of the "Tujia" do not recognize the name "Tujia," believing that they only accepted it in the past to deal with the Hakka and Miao people, as a commonly used name for external communication. Within themselves, they have always consistently used a name that is close to the three Chinese character sounds of "Bizika," "Bijika," or "Mizika." "Bizi," "Biji," or "Mizi" is the name itself, and "ka" is equivalent to "jia" or "zu" (family or ethnic group). It is understood that the "Tujia" comrades advocate that the ethnic name and the name of the autonomous region should not use "Tujia," but rather this self-proclaimed name that has been passed down from ancient times. On this point, the opinions are consistent. But the sounds of "Bizi," "Biji," or "Mizi" must always be represented by Chinese characters, just like the "Buyi" of Guizhou or the "Kawa" of Yunnan. Which two Chinese characters are appropriate to adopt? According to Chinese historical documents, the terms that are close to these two sounds and can also be confirmed to refer to the "Tujia," or their ancestors, or their fellow tribes, for two or three thousand years, are: Bazi, Bixi, Biji, Biji, Beijin, etc. As for using their self-proclaimed names as place names or mountain names where they once resided, such as Maiji, Beijing, and Baijie, it is even more difficult to enumerate. These are almost all recorded by Han people in Chinese characters based on the sound of the "Tujia" self-proclaimed name. But there is one exception, which is "Beijin." During the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, Tian Shunian, the Tusi of Rongmei Tusi (now Hefeng, Hubei), one of the five major "Tujia" Tusi, referred to himself as "Beijin" in the documents he exchanged with the local rulers of western Hubei in the Qing Dynasty. Since the ancestors of the "Tujia" people themselves have used such a Chinese name, we believe that it can be further confirmed, which is more meaningful than temporarily adopting two new characters. We hereby solemnly propose it for the "Tujia" comrades to refer to when discussing.

IV. The Issue of Further Investigation of the "Tujia" Areas

In the autumn of last year, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress launched seven or eight ethnic investigation teams to conduct a more comprehensive and in-depth investigation of the customs, habits, and social nature of various ethnic areas, with a term of four to seven years. One of them is responsible for the Xiang-Qian area. So far, the work of this group has been limited to the Miao ethnic group in eastern Qian. We suggest that this group should establish a subgroup and start the work in Xiang and even the Chuan-E area adjacent to northwestern Xiang in advance. The work of such a subgroup should be immediately designated to focus on the "Tujia" and other descendants of the Ba people. In addition to conducting a relatively long-term investigation of the folk customs and social nature of this area, like other investigation teams, it should cooperate with the local ethnic policy propaganda and education work to first solve the following two problems: (1) In the border areas of the four provinces of Xiang, E, Chuan, and even Qian, in addition to the "Tujia" people who have already reported, how many have not reported but are preparing to report? (2) How large and how many blocks are the places where they live and are scattered? These two issues are most directly related to regional autonomy and must be answered first.

At present, in northwestern Hunan, these two issues have been largely answered through years of reflection and some investigations. But it is not enough; more and more "Tujia" people are constantly "emerging." Although the problem is not big, further comprehensive investigation is still necessary. More important are the provinces of E and Chuan. In Laifeng County, Hubei, the reported "Tujia" population has been constantly "growing" from less than 4,000 in 1952 to 24,000 in 1955 and more than 40,000 by the end of 1956. In Shidi District, Xiushan County, Sichuan, the reported "Tujia" population "jumped" from more than 140 in 1953 (the first general election registration) to more than 5,000 in 1956 (local election registration). Youyang has at least three townships with "Tu ethnic groups," and Pengshui has "Tulao ethnic groups" and "Gulaohu" who enshrine the Baihu (White Tiger) totem of the Ba people. In Nanxiang, Fengjie, there are still 1,000-2,000 households of the Xiang surname living together, and every household enshrine the "Baihu Bodhisattva." Other counties in southwestern E and southeastern Chuan, except for Xuanen, which has already reported, have many signs but no formal reporting examples. Counties such as Wufeng, Xingshan, Hefeng, and Shizhu are not on the main transportation routes, and the mountainous areas are deep and remote. The Han forces entered late, and the "Tujia" people or their fellow tribes have operated independently for a long time. There must be many people and things left behind, but they are the most unnoticed. These should all be included in the scope of work of this subgroup.

The above four suggestions, especially the latter three, we could have directly submitted to the leading body of ethnic work. But ethnic work is a brand-new work, and the "Tujia" are a brotherly ethnic group that has only recently been accepted. They have a long history, first in the northwest, then in the southwest, and in some parts of the Jianghuai River basin, they have made great contributions; their cultural heritage, such as "Bayu Dance" and "Bamboo Branch Song," has long been spread and is equally popular among the Han people; in the wars to unify the motherland during the Zhou, Han, Jin, and Sui dynasties, they all made great efforts. Bayu Dance even constituted the earliest cultural work corps in this army; the first contribution to the Ming Dynasty's resistance to the Japanese pirates on the southeast coast was made by "Tujia" soldiers; they are a group of strong and generous people. The head of civil affairs in one county said to us: In any work called for by the government, it is impossible not to explain the reasons to them clearly first. As long as it is explained clearly first, they do it more simply, quickly, and complete earlier than the Han people. Although we cannot introduce the characteristics of the "Tujia" people in detail here, we are very willing to take this opportunity to let comrades who have not been in contact with the "Tujia" brotherly ethnic group before have a preliminary understanding of them, know that they have finally stood up from the impact of the long-term Han chauvinist wave, and thereby further appreciate the prosperity of the motherland's ethnic family and the greatness of our party's ethnic policies.

### 湘西北、鄂西南、川东南的　一个兄弟民族——土家　向达、潘光旦的联合发言

　　湘西北、鄂西南、川东南的
　　一个兄弟民族——土家
　　向达、潘光旦的联合发言
    结合到一九五六年夏冬两季在湘西北、鄂西南与川东南山区的视察工作，我们提出下面几点有关民族工作的建议。
    关于这个广大的山区，不妨再加上贵州的东北角，允许我们先作一个历史性的说明。这一区域，两三千年来，原是古代的巴人与其后裔聚居得最多与活动得最频繁的地带。巴人与其后裔，在历史上所曾散布到的地域，原比这个还要广泛得多，但从东汉到南北朝，在此地带以外的，基本上都已与汉人无别。只有这四省边区的巴人后裔，则迟到隋唐以来，由于中原政权与文化的不断伸入，才陆续失去他们原有的民族特征与民族意识。
    大抵丧失得最早的是川、鄂两省长江沿岸的巴人后裔，尤其是北岸；时代是隋唐。其次是洞庭湖南北与迤西的流域，澧水流域，沅水沿岸，与川省的黔江沿岸；时代是宋元。我们在这里有的说“流域”，有的只说“沿岸”，是有理由的。这一地带山多，海拔在二千公尺上下的高山不少，县治所在地，高的七八百尺，低的也三四百尺，各大河流与其支派石多滩险，多不通航。因此，中原统治者的力量往往只能保有沿着大河流的点线，广大奥僻的山区面积一贯的归巴人后裔持有，变化有限。又其次是湘省的极西北隅，即辰沅以西，酉水以北地区；鄂省的清江流域，包括今宜昌专区的一小部分与恩施专区的大部分；川省的东南角与黔省的东北角；时代要晚到明清。例如，川省的黔江县与黔省东北的若干县份，中原统治者的政权到明代才最后确立。至于湘省今湘西苗族自治州北境的四五个县，鄂省恩施专区的南六县，川省涪陵专区的石砫、酉阳、秀山等县，则都是清代雍、乾之交，经过所谓“改土归流”，才成立县治，到今扣足只有二百二十年。
    照历史记载推测，这一地带里，除了已被承认的苗族与仡佬族以外，还应该存在着有足够特征与民族意识的巴人后裔。
    从1950年起，在民族政策宣布以后不久，湘省西北境果然就出现了一群称为“土家”的人。接着的历史研究从多方面推溯了他们和古代巴人的渊源关系，肯定的证明了他们是巴人的一部分后裔。
      “土家”究有多少人口呢？这在今天还是一个问题。湘西北各县，经先后填报的，至去年十月为止，已超过三十万人。最近听说已增加到五十万人。湖北的来凤、宣恩，四川的秀山，经填报的，也已在五万以上。贵州有无填报的例子，我们还不知道。湘省的“土家”人，结合了四省的情况一总估计，说可能有到一百万人。这未必是事实，但也说明，“土家”的总人口，要比目前所已填报出来的数目为多；也说明，许多“土家”人没有照实填报，而填了“汉族”。
    湘省的“土家”人从1950年起就提出了肯定其为一个兄弟民族的要求。经过调查研究，政府终于在1956年10月间接受了他们的要求，虽还没有正式公布，在当地已加以宣告。三四个月来，他们所表示的欢欣鼓舞是难以言语形容的。但我们也必须承认，这问题的解决是拖延得太久了一些，这种拖延也曾为工作带来一些损失。在湖北与四川，填报的“土家”人比湖南要少得多，来凤以外，要求也不如湖南的那样迫切，省领导方面虽也注意到这问题，似乎到现在还没有作明白承认的表示。
    这就引进到我们所要提出的第一点建议。
　　一、民族政策的宣传教育问题
    别的民族地区的情况，我们不熟悉，但在“土家”人或其他巴人后裔的地区，这种宣传教育工作是显然的没有做好，没有做够。湘省“土家”成份问题的所以迟迟始得解决；我们对川、鄂两省“土家”的所以到今还未能作出任何明白的表示；以及这几省很大一部分“土家”人的所以不敢轻于表白自己的民族成份，有的填报得很迟，有的至今还没有填报——我们认为原因就在这里。
    民族政策的宣传教育所产生的作用是两面的：对兄弟民族是一面，对汉族又是一面。
    先说对兄弟民族的一面。几年来，一个兄弟民族的受到承认，需要通过两方面的条件。一是客观上有足够的民族特征，如聚居区、共同语言、习俗、信仰等。二是主观的民族意识与要求。我们似乎认为：如果一个人群具备这些条件，他们便自然而然的会提出民族要求来，一经提出，我们当然须要加以研究处理；否则，便认为他们既没有要求，我们自无庸处理。这样一个看法忽略了一个重要事实，即有的民族区划清楚、人口众多、特征明显、历史发展少交叉、接受汉族的影响较浅；而有的民族与此相反。对前一类的民族，问题显著，即使他们不自行提出要求，我们也会加以处理承认。后一类则不然，问题不明显，他们不易于自动提出要求，乃至根本不了解民族要求是甚么一回事。
    对于这后一类的民族或可能的民族，我们似乎没有想到，他们是处在如下的情况之中，就是：在数千百年大民族主义的积威之下，他们对暴露自己的民族成份，怀有极其深刻的顾虑，他们甚至“想”做汉人，至少做到表面上要和汉人分辨不出来。于是，首先，他们把自己固有的特征掩藏起来，至少在同时有汉人进出的场合里，不说自己的语言了，不穿戴自己的服饰了，不履行自己的习俗与信仰仪式了。其次，客观特征的经久不能自由表达势必导致主观意识的日益趋于淡薄。这种情况，当然不是一声解放所能改变，只有通过足够的民族政策宣传教育的影响，才能改变。只有在情况改变之后，他们才会把内心蕴蓄着的应有的要求自动地表达出来。
      “土家”人的民族要求，在湘省，最初只有少数人自动提出，后来经过这少数人在本族内部的宣传，敢于承认自己民族成份的人才逐渐加多。来凤县估计可能有六万人，而最初敢于出头登记的才三千多人。四年来，宣恩县登记的“土家”人始终停留在一千七百余的数字上，而县首长承认实际不止此数。去年国庆节，秀山县石堤区有一“土家”农民，被邀到成都代表观礼，他坚决不肯去，说他是“汉人”，不能代表，县领导提醒他说，“你的哥哥最近已经承认是‘土家’了”，他才也承认下来，同意到成都去。酉阳县至少有三个乡有“土族”，其中一乡还能说“土话”，但至今登记的绝无一例。彭水县一向有“土老族”，单单一个庹姓就有一千几百户，但谁也不敢自己承认是属于这一族。这些例子，已足够说明我们没有把民族政策的宣传工作做好。我们走过的许多县份的县首长也都承认，几年来忙于恢复地方秩序与安排生产工作，这方面确乎做得很不够，有的更坦率的承认，在我们和他们谈话之前，根本没有想到本地方可能有非汉族的民族成份存在。
    民族政策的宣传教育，对汉族的意义比上面所说的更要大些，因为执行民族政策的毕竟以汉族干部为多。就民族要求一问题来说，此种教育的意义，对兄弟民族来说，是敢于暴露自己而提出要求，已如上面所说，而对汉族干部来说，是勇于发见事实而接受要求。一个汉族干部，如果没有受到足够的民族政策教育，他不可能不是一个大汉族主义者，他用汉族的尺度来打量非汉族，他只注意非汉族与汉族的相同之点，而忽略他们的相异之点。而如上面所说，非汉族在大汉族主义长期压力之下，确也往往把此种相异之点掩饰起来，于是在他看来，他们更是汉族无疑了。他当然也看不到这种压力的作用，因为他自己就是这种压力的一部分。即使他偶然发见到一些特殊的地方，他又一定曲为解释，说这些特点是地方性的，属于民俗学的范围、而不属于民族学的范围；或者说，它们是汉族与非汉族混合的表现，人是混合了，语言也混合了，因而产生了这些特点，等等！总之，他认为，这样一群人尽管有要求，决不可能是一个单一的民族。
    在湘省的“土家”问题上，我们在汉族的民族工作干部中确乎发见过有这种思想情况与发为此种议论的人。有的汉族干部甚至还不大了解甚么叫做民族，谈到“民族”时，时常用“种族”二字。这样一个名词的错误也说明了，我们在汉族干部方面，民族政策的宣教工作是做得很不够的，也正唯其不够，大汉族主义思想还未能消除，从而使“土家”问题的解决遭受到不必要的拖延。
    在最近一次最高国务会议的扩大会议上，我们听到毛主席的十二点指示，其中一点就是大汉族主义必须彻底清除。我们认为这种清除的工作必须从做好民族政策的宣传教育入手。听了指示以后，又结合到我们所曾接触到的“土家”问题，加以思考，自信有了些新的体会，所以敢在此作为一个建议提出，供政府参考。
　　二、成立“土家”自治区的问题
    湘西北“土家”受接纳为一兄弟民族以后，接着要解决的就是区域自治的问题。据我们了解，在这问题上“土家”人中间有三种不同的意见。一是与湘西苗族自治州联合；绝大部分的“土家”人口聚居在苗族自治州所托管的北四县境界以内，和苗族有过长期共同生活与合作的历史，因此，区域自治应当联合办理。二是与湘西苗族自治州分立，成为单独的“土家”自治区域，理由是两个民族各有各的特点，居住地域虽毗连，乃至还有些交叉，历史的发展也还曾经引起过感情上的隔阂，目前基本上虽团结，实际上也还存留着一些距离。这两个意见都是以湖南一省为限的。三是认为“土家”自治区应包括与湖南接界的川鄂两省的一些“土家”居住区在内，这当然也是主张要和湘西苗族自治州分开的。
    我们的意见是：
    （1）湖南省境以内“土家”区域自治应先行成立，一则因为多方面的条件已经趋于成熟，再则因为他们的要求已经提出多年了。至于湖北与四川境内的，则不妨稍缓一些；因为在这两省里，“土家”人口究有多少，所集中居住的地区究有多大，还有待于我们做些宣传与调查工作，才能初步肯定，肯定以后才能着手。
      （2）在湖南成立“土家”自治区域，与早已成立了的湘西苗族自治州的分合关系，是必须郑重考虑的。我们认为，分也许比合更为适当。我们研究这一地区的历史，发见苗与“土”之间是有过长期的隔阂的，而这隔阂也是中原统治者所一手造成的。可以说，远自东汉初年起，中原统治者就一贯的利用“土家”祖先的统治阶层来控制当地的一切非汉族人民，其中主要的就是属于苗瑶系统的一群人；从唐末五代起，这种控制更趋向于具体化，有属于汉族统治阶层的人“入主”了这地区，自己先“土家”化了，然后驾驭着“土家”来控制苗族；元、明、清三代实行所谓“土司”制度，一直到清代雍正年间“改土归流”为止，大小“土司”几乎全部由“土家”人承当，对当地的苗族，代替中原统治者经常“约束”，随时镇压；大抵“土司”是地主，是军官，而苗民是佃户，是兵丁，前者是统治者，后者是被统治者。两千年来，表面上生活在一起，实际上蕴蓄着不少的矛盾。
    严格的说，历史上的这种矛盾是存在于“土家”统治阶层与“土家”人民及苗族人民之间，但在不甚理解阶级矛盾的道理的前代，总像矛盾是存在于“土家”与苗族之间，就是把阶级矛盾完全看作民族矛盾。这种看法虽属错误，却是一个客观的存在，解放只有得七八年，至今也还继续的存在。我们在视察中所接触到的苗族干部同志，对“土家”的民族要求，乃至对政府为此而派出的调查人员，大都表示冷淡与不欢迎，我们认为原因就在这里，他们有顾虑，顾虑着“土家”的统治也许要卷土重来。
    这种错误的看法与态度，我们认为，也曾影响着我们的地方行政，致使“土家”的民族要求问题拖延了过多的时日。有一位地方领导同志（汉族）对我们说，“解放前，‘土家’与客家（即汉人）一样的压迫过苗家，你能让‘土家’与苗家一样么？”意思是不能容许“土家”同苗族一样的被接受为一个兄弟民族。“土家”问题就是曾经这样的拖延了的。而这一段不必要的拖延，又不免在“土家”人一边，引起了不快之感，无疑的把历史上早已存在的隔阂又加添了几分。
    这些事实是不幸的，但毕竟是事实，历史事实，也是当前还反映着的事实。我们认为，在考虑苗、“土”区域自治分合问题时，必须充分估计到它。联合自治，使他们可以更紧密的合作，从而消除过去的隔阂，对同一地区的经济发展，更易于作通盘的筹划与调剂，这当然都是好的。但这样一个考虑是否全面，是否考虑到了这种密切合作在现阶段的可能性究有多大，而如果各搞各的自治，前途紧密合作的可能性是否反而要大些，都还值得研究。
      （3）“土家”的区域自治，与湘西苗族自治州，分也罢，合也罢，我们认为在正式作出决定以前，还须多多的协商，不要怕麻烦，不要怕多费一点时间。有米不怕饭迟，既邀承认，终必自治，我们想这在“土家”人是不会不同意的。第一，苗族与“土家”之间须要充分的协商，合好，还是分好，能合，固然好，但也不要勉强，勉强合，不如分。其次，“土家”人中主张分合的两面也必须充分与反复的协商。我们了解，主张分的“土家”人大多数是几年来对自己民族成份的肯定问题奔走呼号出力较多的人，而主张合的则大多数是一向对这问题并不十分关心而在湘西苗族自治州的各级行政机构里以“汉族”的成份工作了多年的人。这两方面的人，在思想与感情上，不可能没有距离，这距离也必须通过协商，加以消除；如果协商不够，而草率与片面的作出分或合的决定来，那显然是不好的。我们在此要求两点，一是湖南地方行政应当大力协助这种协商的进行，让不同意见的各方面得以充分接触，自由讨论，尽情争辩，终于使不同的意见基本上归于一致。二是不同意见的各方面同志们，要破除成见、心平气和的从事协商，同时要满怀的信任我们的政府，在协商的基础之上，一定终于会作出合乎政策而使各方都获得满意的结论来。
　　三、“土家”与“土家”自治区域应有的正式名称问题
    这也是目前正在讨论中的一个题目。“土家”之称，年老一些与稍知“土家”来历的“土家”人是不承认的，认为以前为了应付客家与苗家，才接受下来，作为一个对外通用的称呼。在他们自己内部，则历来一贯用近乎“比兹卡”、“比基卡”或“密兹卡”三个汉字音的称呼。“比兹”、“比基”、或“密兹”是称呼的本身，“卡”相当于“家”或“族”。据了解，“土家”同志们主张族名和自治区的名称应不用“土家”，而用这自古相传的自称，在这一点上，意见是一致的。但“比兹”、“比基”、或“密兹”之音总须用汉字来代表，好比贵州的“布依”或云南的“佧佤”等。究竟采用那两个汉字为适当呢？据汉文历史文献，近乎这两个字音而也可以肯定为指称“土家”、或其祖先、或其同族的名词，二三千年来，有：巴子、鼻息、必际、比跻、贝锦，等。至于用他们的自称来作为他们所曾居留过的地名山名如麦积、北井、百节之类，则更难以枚举。这些几乎全都是汉人根据“土家”自称之音用汉文记录下来的。但有一个例外，就是“贝锦”。清代康熙年间“土家”五大土司之一的容美土司（今湖北鹤峰）田舜年，在他和清朝鄂西地方统治者来往的文件中，自称为“贝锦”。“土家”人自己的祖先既用过这样一个汉文名称，我们认为可以进一步肯定下来，比临时采取两个新的字，更为有意义；我们在此郑重提出，供“土家”同志们讨论时的参考。
　　四、“土家”地区的进一步调查问题
      去年秋季全国人民代表大会常务委员会发动了七八个民族调查组，到各民族地区去进行风俗、习惯、与社会性质的比较全面与深入的调查，以四至七年为期。其中一个是负责湘黔地区的。到目前为止，这一组的工作还只限于黔东的苗族。我们建议，这一组应当建立一个分组，提前把工作展开到湘境以至毗连湘西北的川鄂地区。这样一个分组的工作应即规定以“土家”与其他巴人后裔为对象，除和其他调查组一样，就这一地区的民俗与社会性质做比较长期的调查以外，应配合地方的民族政策宣传教育工作，先解决下面的两个问题：（1）湘、鄂、川、乃至黔等四省边区，除已填报的“土家”人外，没有填报而准备填报的究竟还有多少；（2）他们所聚居与散居到的地方究有多大，究有几块。这两个问题与区域自治有最直接的关系，必须首先解答。
    目前，在湘西北，这两个问题经过历年的反映与一些调查，大体上是已经有了答案的。但还不够；至今不断的有更多的“土家”人“冒”出来。问题虽已不大，进一步的全面调查也还有必要。更重要的是鄂、川等省境内。湖北来凤县填报的“土家”人口，从52年的不到四千，到55年的二万四千，到56年底的四万以上，不断的在“增长”。四川秀山县石堤区填报的“土家”人，从53年（第一次普选登记）的一百四十余人一“跃”而为56年（地方选举登记）的五千多人。酉阳至少有三个乡有“土族”，彭水有“土老族”与“古老户”供有巴人图腾——白虎——的神位。奉节南乡尚有一二千户聚居的向姓人，户户供“白虎菩萨”。其它鄂西南与川东南各县除宣恩已有填报外，其余迹象虽多，尚无正式填报之例。五峰、兴山、鹤峰、石砫等县都不在交通大路上，山区深僻，汉人势力进去得迟，“土家”人或其同族自己独立经营的时间长，遗留下来的人与物一定不少，但最为注意所不及。这些都应纳入这小组的工作范围之内。
    上面四点建议，尤其是后面三点，我们本来可以向民族工作的领导机构直接提出的。但民族工作是一种崭新的工作，“土家”又是最近被接纳下来的一个兄弟民族，历史悠远，起初在西北，后来在西南，和部分的江淮流域开拓经营，作出过巨大的贡献；他们的文化遗产，如“巴渝舞”与“竹枝歌”早就传播出来，在汉族中一样的流行；在周、汉、晋、隋历次统一祖国的战争中，他们都出过很大的力量，巴渝舞还构成过这种军队中最早的文工大队；明代对东南沿海倭寇的抗击，第一功是“土家”兵建立的；他们是一群坚强豪爽的人，有一个县的民政工作首长对我们说：在政府所号召的任何工作里，不先把道理对他们说清楚是不行的，只要先说清楚，他们干得比汉人干脆、快当、完成得早。我们在此虽无法把“土家”人的特点详细介绍，但极愿借此机会让以前没有接触到过“土家”这一兄弟民族的同志们对他们有一个初步的认识，知道他们终于从长期大汉族主义浪潮的冲击中挺拔了起来，从而进一步体会到祖国民族大家庭的繁昌与我们党的民族政策的伟大。（附图片）
