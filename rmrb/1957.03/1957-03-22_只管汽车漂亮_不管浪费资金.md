　　Only Caring About Beautiful Cars
　　Regardless of Wasting Funds
    Since the second half of last year, many institutions, enterprises, and schools in Shanghai have been repairing cars, excessively emphasizing beautiful appearance, resulting in significant waste.
    Zhongguo and two other car repair factories in Shanghai refitted 28 large buses last year, of which 16 were converted into 800-type bodies. The interior and exterior fittings of this type of body are even more beautiful than those of the "Skoda" cars produced in Czechoslovakia. Units such as Shanghai First Normal School, Nanjing Aviation Institute, and the Wuhan Air Force Logistics Department, in order to convert to this type of body, did not hesitate to knock off the original usable, and even very beautiful, cabs and body platforms. Units such as Factory 443 and the Fourth Bureau of the Second Ministry of Machinery Industry also felt that this type of body was not grand enough and insisted on installing radios, heating pipes, electric clocks, and other equipment. Even the fire-fighting lighting vehicles used by the Taiyuan and Changchun Public Security Bureaus had to be refitted with streamlined bodies like the 800 type. Manufacturing an 800-type body requires 7,000 man-hours, with a total cost of around 20,000 yuan. Compared with the already quite beautiful 600-type body, man-hours are doubled, and costs are tripled. The iron sheets, copper sheets, lead sheets, chromium, etc., needed to refit this type of body are all materials urgently needed for national construction.
    The extravagance and waste in small car repairs is also very serious. Several small cars repaired by the Hunan Provincial Health Department and Education Department, the Anqing Municipal Party Committee, and other units could have been used with just a little repair, but they felt that the models were too old and the exteriors were not beautiful enough, so they requested to be converted to 1947 and 1954 type bodies. This requires a lot of manpower, making the repair cost of each car as high as 5,000 to 6,000 yuan or more. A 1939 Buick car repaired by the Handan Municipal Party Committee had an exterior that could have been used, but in order to convert it to a 1947 exterior, it was completely remade; the interior equipment was also very luxurious, with seat cushions and headliners made of wool costing 25.9 yuan per meter, costing 336 yuan for this item alone. The total repair and refitting cost of this car reached more than 13,000 yuan, not including the radio, heating and cooling, electric clocks, and other equipment they bought themselves. A 1940 Buick car from the Guangxi Provincial Trade Union was also luxuriously decorated after major repairs, with not only radio and heating and cooling equipment, but also automatic cigarette lighters and spotlights—truly everything one could want. Some workers said: This is not a car, but a bridal sedan! The Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee's Foreign Affairs Office even specially transported two small cars by train, specifically requesting to be converted into Soviet ZIM models; a medium-sized Jeep also came with a sample photo of a "Pontiac" station wagon, requesting to be converted in the same way. If they weren't converted in the same way, they would complain, saying, "The leader saw this style at a meeting in Beijing and liked it very much." And a section chief was specially sent to negotiate.
    What is even more serious is that this phenomenon of extravagance and waste has not stopped until now. According to statistics from the Shanghai Automotive Repair Company, among the 88 large buses registered for refitting, 74 requested to be refitted with 800-type bodies; there are still many small cars being repaired that request to have their models changed.
    Now is the time to stop this extravagance and waste! Units repairing cars should first pay attention to this issue, and repair enterprises should also actively oppose this unhealthy phenomenon.　Zhang Zhao

### 只管汽车漂亮　不管浪费资金

　　只管汽车漂亮
  　不管浪费资金
    去年下半年以来，不少机关、企业、学校在上海修理汽车，过分讲究外形漂亮，造成很大浪费。
    上海的忠国等三个修理汽车的工厂，去年改装了二十八辆大型客车，其中改成800型车身的就有十六辆。这种车身的内外装置比捷克斯洛伐克出的“斯柯达”牌的汽车还要漂亮。上海第一师范学校、南京航空学院、武汉空军后勤部等单位，为了要改这种车身，不惜把原来可以使用的，甚至很漂亮的驾驶室、车身平台全部敲去。四四三厂、第二机械工业部第四局等单位还嫌这种车身气派不够大，硬要装上无线电、暖气管、电钟等设备。连太原市公安局、长春市公安局救火用的消防照明车，也要改装成像800型一样的流线型车身。制造一辆800型车身需要七千工时，全部费用在二万元左右。同已经相当美观的600型车身比较，工时增加一倍，费用增加两倍，改装这种车身需要的铁皮、铜皮、铅皮、铬等，都是国家建设亟需的物资。
    小轿车修理上的铺张浪费现象也很严重。湖南省卫生厅和教育厅、中共安庆市委等单位修理的几辆小轿车，本来只要稍加修理就可使用，但是他们认为车型太旧，外壳不漂亮，就要求改装为1947年和1954年型的车身。这样，就要花费大量人工，使每辆车的修理费用高达五、六千元以上。中共邯郸市委修理的一辆1939年别克式小汽车，外壳本来可以用，但为了改成1947年外型，就全部新制；里面的设备也很奢华，座垫、车顶是用每公尺二十五元九角的呢子做的，仅这一项就花了三百三十六元。这辆车的全部修理改装费用达一万三千余元，这还不包括他们自己买的无线电、冷热气、电钟等设备。广西省工会一辆1940年的别克式小汽车，大修后也是装饰得富丽堂皇，不仅有无线电、冷热气设备，还有自动点烟器、摇光灯，真是应有尽有。有的工人说：这不是轿车，而是新娘子坐的花轿！江西省人民委员会交际处还特地用火车运来两辆小汽车，指定要改成苏联吉姆式；一辆中型吉普也附来“胖的克”旅行车的样片，要求照样改装。不给照样改装，他们还有意见，说：“首长在北京开会时看见这种式样，很喜欢。”并且专门派了个科长前来接洽。
    更严重的是，这种铺张浪费的现象到现在还没有停止。据上海市汽车修理公司统计，在登记改装的八十八辆大型客车中，要求改装800型车身的就有七十四辆；修理小轿车，要求改车型的也还不少。
    现在，是制止这种铺张浪费的时候了！修理汽车的单位首先应该注意这一问题，承修企业也应该主动地反对这种不良现象。　张钊
