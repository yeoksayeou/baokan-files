I warmly support Chairman Mao's speech and Premier Zhou's report, and I agree with the special reports of the leaders.

I have participated in the production, education, and research of cast iron, and I have also had the opportunity to contact some factories, mines, higher industrial schools, and research institutions. I would like to offer some superficial opinions on the issues of cast iron and the number and distribution of industrial scientific research institutions. Striving to Explore New Uses of Cast Iron
    I. Cast iron is an important metal material. Its annual output is about five times that of copper or four times that of cotton. Fully utilizing the various new achievements of cast iron is a constant and reliable means to improve the quality of machinery and equipment and reduce costs. It is also an immediately effective method to save a large amount of steel and some copper materials.

Around the time of the national liberation, ductile iron appeared in the world's foundry industry. The foundry workers of China responded to the call of the Party and the government, strengthened unity, and broke down the barriers between manual labor and mental labor. Therefore, they were able to quickly master and improve the technology of producing ductile iron. In terms of the mechanical properties of ductile iron, they reached the world's first-class level. That is to say, the tensile strength representing strength and the impact value representing toughness have increased to three times or more of these properties of cast iron before liberation. The efficiency of spheroidizing agents used in some factories in our country is also the highest in the world. As early as 1952, workshops regularly producing ductile iron products were all over the country. In recent years, ductile iron has achieved remarkable results in increasing production and saving costs in various machinery manufacturing departments in our country, as well as in metallurgy, coal, railway, transportation, textile and other departments. However, we cannot be complacent about this. I believe that further collective efforts should be made to improve the methods of spheroidizing treatment, stabilize the quality of ductile iron products, and explore new uses in more complex situations.

The technical team engaged in cast iron work in our country is still very young, and not enough attention has been paid to malleable cast iron, inoculated cast iron, alloy cast iron, and white cast iron. Using their strengths, these types of cast iron can also play a broad role in increasing production and saving costs. For example, adopting new methods, we are confident to shorten the production process of malleable cast iron, simplify production equipment, improve its mechanical properties, and relax the restrictions on the size of castings. Comprehensive utilization of various new methods can also reduce the amount of alloy elements used in alloy cast iron, thereby reducing costs, or improve the properties of alloy cast iron to expand its use in the chemical industry and power industry. Excellent casting properties, rapidly improving mechanical properties, and simple production equipment are the characteristics of cast iron. Our country used cast iron more than 2,000 years ago, which was very early, and therefore praised by scholars from various countries. In recent years, due to the emergence of a series of new developments, cast iron is in a stage of multi-faceted advancement all over the world. I believe that the foundry workers in our country, growing up in the era of Chairman Mao, will surely seize the characteristics of cast iron, actively utilize and improve various cast iron, to accelerate the manufacture of machinery and equipment and reduce costs, thereby accumulating huge wealth for our beloved motherland.

Adding Research Institutions to Fill in Blank Categories and Blank Areas
    II. In recent years, scientific research has made progress in both quantity and quality. However, the direct service to industrial production is still not enough, and there are not many examples of indirectly creating a new foundation for industry. Strengthening organizational work is an important measure to improve the effectiveness of scientific research. The coordination of scientific research is now being carried out vigorously. Regarding the issue of industrial scientific research institutions, I think that some institutions should be gradually added to fill in the blank categories and blank areas. At the same time, we should currently avoid setting up too many institutions with similar characteristics in various ministries and bureaus.

The establishment of industrial scientific research institutions must be closely combined with the conditions and requirements of our country, and refer to the situation and direction of industrial scientific research in various countries. In recent years, the industrial production in our country has not only increased in quantity, but also put forward increasing requirements in variety and quality. Industrial scientific research should pave the way for strengthening product quantity, opening up new varieties, and improving the quality of the production process. Therefore, it appears that some categories of scientific research are currently being neglected. It is necessary to gradually add some research institutions to fill in the blank categories. Secondly, the concentration of research institutions in regions has advantages and disadvantages. It was beneficial to be more concentrated in the first few years, as this approach was more effective. After these years, the shortcomings of insufficient attention to various regions have become apparent. Our country has a vast area, and the products, climate, transportation, and production capacity of various regions are very different. At present, the research strength in many regions and many provinces is very weak. Research institutions with relatively abundant human and material resources should be gradually added in various regions.

Taking the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, the Second Ministry of Machine Building Industry, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Coal Industry, and the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Industry as examples, their production objects are different, such as vehicles, ships, sand injection pipes, ingot molds, heavy machinery, and general machinery. However, they use many of the same categories of production technology, such as foundry, forging, and welding. At present, the industrial scientific team is not large enough. If each ministry and bureau establishes one or even several research institutions separately, it will waste funds and will not be able to find enough researchers. It is better to jointly build a relatively small number of research institutions to meet similar requirements, and the personnel and equipment will be more abundant, which can solve problems for production sooner. In the future, as needed and possible, the jointly built institutions will be divided into several or new institutions will be added.

Finally, I would like to say something about the impression that the growing scientific and technological team has given me. I worked in the Northeast five years ago. Last year, I participated in the inspection of the Northeast. In nine industrial cities, I saw that the density of intermediate and junior technicians in each workshop had increased to three to five times that of five years ago, thus playing a technical guarantee effect on the brilliant achievements on the production front. In recent years, very effective tutorial classes and night schools have been widely developed in factories and mines in our country. Higher industrial schools and secondary technical schools have also provided a considerable number of graduates to industrial departments. However, this is only the beginning of the growth of the scientific and technological team.

The growth of a conscious and large number of scientific and technological personnel is an important basis for the socialist industrialization of the motherland. I see the surging wave of the growing scientific and technological team in our country.

I firmly believe that under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, in 1967 we will surely be able to build our great motherland into a strong and complete industrial system, and reach or approach the advanced level in the world in various major departments of science at that time.

### 科学研究要更好地为生产服务  王遵明的发言

    科学研究要更好地为生产服务
    王遵明的发言
    我热烈拥护毛主席的讲话和周总理的报告，并同意各位首长的专题报告。
    我参加过关于铸铁的生产、教育和研究工作，也有机会接触到一部分厂矿、高等工业学校和研究机构。我想对铸铁问题和工业科学研究机构的数目和分布问题提出一些粗浅的意见。努力开辟铸铁的新用途
    一、铸铁是重要的金属材料。它的每年产量大约是铜的五倍或棉花的四倍。充分利用铸铁的各种新成就是改进机器和设备的质量并降低成本的经常可靠的手段，也是大量节约钢材和部分铜料的立即见效的方法。
    约当全国解放之时，球墨铸铁在世界的铸造工业中出现。中国的铸造工作者响应党和政府的号召，加强了团结，打破了体力劳动和脑力劳动的隔阂，因而能够迅速掌握并改进生产球墨铸铁的技术。在球墨铸铁的机械性质上，他们达到了世界上的第一流水平。也就是说，在代表力量的抗张强度上和代表韧性的冲击值上提高到解放前铸铁的这些性质的三倍或更多。我国若干工厂使用球化剂的效率在世界上也是最高的。远在1952年经常生产球墨铸铁成品的车间就已遍布全国。这几年球墨铸铁在我国各个机械制造部门以至冶金、煤炭、铁道、交通、纺织等部门都已取得显著的增产节约的效果。但是，也不能因此自满。我以为在改进球化处理的方法、稳定球墨铸铁成品的质量和开辟情况比较复杂的新用途等方面都还应该作进一步的集体努力。
    我国从事铸铁工作的技术队伍还很年轻，对可锻铸铁、孕育铸铁、合金铸铁、白口铸铁还注意得不够。用其所长，这些种类的铸铁也能起广泛的增产节约的作用。例如，采用新手段就有把握缩短可锻铸铁的生产过程、简化生产设备、提高它的机械性质、放宽对铸件尺寸的限制。综合利用各种新手段也可以减少合金铸铁中合金元素的使用量从而降低成本，或改进合金铸铁的性质以扩大它在化学工业、动力工业中的用途。铸造性质优良、机械性质正在飞跃地提高、生产设备依旧简单是铸铁的特色。我国在二千多年前就已使用铸铁，这是很早的，因此为各国学者所称扬。这几年由于一连串新发展的出现，铸铁在全世界正处在多方面推进的境界。我相信，我国的铸造工作者生长在毛主席的时代一定会抓住铸铁的特点主动地利用和改进各种铸铁，以加速机器和设备的制造并降低成本，从而为我们的亲爱的祖国积累巨大的财富。增添研究机构补足空白门类和空白地区
    二、这几年科学研究在数量上和质量上都有进展。但是直接对工业生产的服务还是不够，间接为工业创立新基础的事例也是不多。加强组织工作是提高科学研究的效果的重要措施。现在正在大力进行科学研究的协调工作。关于工业科学的研究机构的问题，我以为应该逐渐添设一些机构以补足门类的空白和地区的空白，同时目前还应该避免在各部、局设置数目过多而性质相近的机构。
    工业科学的研究机构的设置必须密切结合我国的条件和要求，并参照各国工业科学研究的情况和方向。几年来我国的工业生产不但在数量上增多，在品种上和质量上也提出日益增长的要求。工业科学的研究工作应该为强化产品数量、开辟新品种和提高质量的生产过程铺平道路。因此，就显得目前忽略了某些门类的科学研究。有必要逐渐添设一些研究机构以补足门类的空白。其次，研究机构在地区上集中有优点也有缺点。最初几年比较集中是有好处的，这样做效力较高。经过这几年就显露出对各地区照顾不够的缺点。我国面积广大，各地区的物产、气候、交通和生产能力很不相同。现在许多地区、许多省的研究力量是很薄弱的。应该逐渐在各地区添设人力物力比较充实的研究机构。
    以第一机械工业部、第二机械工业部、铁道部、交通部、冶金工业部、煤炭工业部、电机制造工业部各部、局为例，它们的生产对象不同，例如车辆、船只、注砂管、钢锭模、重型机器、通用机器各不相同，但它们使用的生产技术有很多相同的门类，例如铸工、锻工、焊工。目前工业科学的队伍还不够大，倘若各部、局分别建立一个以至若干个研究机构，就会浪费资金，还找不到足够的研究人员。不如合建比较少数的研究机构以满足性质相近的要求，人员和设备就会比较充实，能够早日为生产解决问题。将来随需要和可能，再把合建的机构分成几个或添设新机构。
    最后，我想说一下科学技术队伍的日益壮大给我的印象。五年前我在东北工作过。去年我参加了视察东北的工作。在九个工业城市我看见各车间的中级初级技术人员的密度增加到五年前的三倍至五倍，因而对生产战线上的辉煌成绩起了技术上保证的效果。几年来在我国的厂矿广泛开展了十分有效的补习班和夜校。高等工业学校和中等技术学校各专业也向工业部门提供了相当数量的毕业生。但是，这只是科学技术队伍壮大的开始。
    有觉悟的大量科学技术人员的成长是祖国的社会主义工业化的重要根据。我看见我国科学技术队伍的日益壮大的汹涌的波涛。
    我完全相信，在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在1967年我们必定能够将我们的伟大的祖国建成一个强大的完整的工业体系，并在科学的各个主要部门达到或接近那时世界上的先进水平。（附图片）
