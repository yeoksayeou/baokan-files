On Scientific Research in Institutions of Higher Education
Gu Weijing's Speech

I wholeheartedly agree with Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people at the recent enlarged Supreme State Conference, and I have been greatly inspired. I understand that contradictions are the fundamental cause of the development of things, and that development is the process of struggle between opposing sides. Within the people, the struggle between opposing sides is mainly the struggle between new and old, progressive and backward, correct and erroneous. Even after the bourgeoisie as a class is eliminated, bourgeois ideology will remain for a considerable period. The habits of hundreds of millions of people cannot disappear immediately with the elimination of their material existence (the exploiting class and the system of private ownership). There will always be progressive, intermediate, and backward elements in society. The so-called progressive elements refer to those with more working-class ideology, while the so-called intermediate and backward elements refer to those with less working-class elements and more bourgeois or other non-working-class elements in their positions, viewpoints, methods, attitudes, and styles. Therefore, to continuously advance the intermediate and backward and to make the progressive even more progressive is an arduous and difficult political task in moving towards socialism and communist society. The Party's policy towards intellectuals fully embodies the spiritual essence of this unity and education. I understand that the Chinese Communist Party's policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" with democratic parties and the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" in academic thought serve the same purpose based on the same spirit. This same spirit is to further promote people's democracy and freedom, and the same purpose is to mobilize all forces to serve the cause of socialist construction.

This year is the year to finally and comprehensively complete the First Five-Year Plan. Based on this, the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of our national economy will be further formulated. Engaging in national economic construction of unprecedented scale so effectively demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the unwavering study of the Soviet Union, and the sincere and selfless assistance of fraternal countries of the people's democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, our economic development rate not only far exceeds that of capitalist countries but even surpasses the achievements of the Soviet Union in the corresponding period after the October Revolution. While carrying out economic construction, our political and cultural construction have also been coordinated relatively well, so the entire national construction has developed very smoothly, and we have been able to stand at the forefront of defending the path of Marxism-Leninism amidst the international countercurrent caused by imperialism's exploitation of the criticism of Stalin's mistakes.

Although our country has taken on a new look and undergone fundamental changes in recent years, it has only taken one step on the road from a backward agricultural country to an advanced industrial country. It should be admitted that our scientific and technological level is generally very low. We are in an era of so-called "atomic revolution" in technological transformation. In order to establish our own strong industry more quickly, the Party Central Committee put forward the call to march towards science and then formulated the twelve-year science plan, requiring us to catch up with or approach the world's advanced level in about twelve years. This is entirely necessary. Therefore, following the high tide of economic construction, there will inevitably be, and already is, a high tide of cultural construction. As a higher education worker, I would like to talk about some of my personal views on some issues related to universities and colleges in this regard.

As mentioned above, the purpose of marching towards science is to use more perfect technology to establish and continuously transform our industry, agriculture, and transportation, and to improve people's living and health standards. Since the task of higher industrial schools is to train the talents urgently needed for the country's industrial construction, continuing to improve the quality of teaching on the existing basis is directly implementing the call to march towards science. Neglecting teaching and one-sidedly emphasizing scientific research and thesis work is unrealistic and puts the cart before the horse. Of course, in order to improve the quality of teaching, teachers in universities and colleges must engage in scientific research in combination with teaching, so as to deeply understand the essence of the problem and enrich teaching content through research. The problem is that after the teaching reform, due to the rapid development of higher education and the shortage of teachers, the teaching workload of teachers is generally too heavy, and they lack sufficient time to carry out scientific research. The solution should be to adjust the standards of teaching workload and consider increasing the number of scientific research personnel in universities and colleges, so that teaching work can be further improved while scientific research can be vigorously carried out in universities and colleges.

Since the formulation of the national science plan, many units have newly established scientific research institutions at all levels, but the research foundation of our country's technical sciences was very weak in the past. More importantly, there is a great lack of scientific research leadership talents at the middle and upper levels, and a considerable part of them are scattered in various universities and colleges. If we increase the number of scientific research personnel in some universities and colleges with suitable conditions, establish and strengthen the foundation of scientific research, cultivate an atmosphere of academic research, and even form some schools of thought in our country, it will play a greater role in promoting the improvement of our country's scientific level. At the same time, the establishment of this scientific base can also enable universities and colleges to truly undertake the task of training formal graduate students, thereby ensuring a certain quality of teachers and intermediate scientific research personnel.

In principle, the scientific research plans of universities and colleges should be included in the overall national scientific plan. However, universities and colleges after all bear the task of teaching, especially in the early stages of scientific research, the methods of scientific research must be diversified, teachers at all levels should be realistic, and each should proceed according to their own pace. It is not appropriate to demand uniformity. Scientific research should not be regarded as something unattainable and thus be hesitant to move forward. Scientific research is originally a process of continuous accumulation, refinement, and consolidation of knowledge. It is impossible for everything to be prepared in advance and then go smoothly as desired. There is no need for young teachers to spend too much time supplementing their basic knowledge. We must resolutely implement the policy of running science diligently and frugally. Relevant departments should assist in solving the problem of the supply of books, materials, and raw materials for manufacturing equipment. The Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Higher Education can consider organizing a certain method and mechanism for the exchange of books and materials, and gradually be able to introduce and be responsible for handling inquiries about books and materials.

Finally, it should be admitted that the teaching reform of universities and colleges has achieved positive results in recent years. Due to the division of majors and the carrying out of teaching according to needs, graduates over the years have basically been able to bear production tasks in their work positions more quickly and vigorously support the country's economic construction. However, there are still some shortcomings in the training work of higher industrial schools. Recently, I have seen many discussions in newspapers and periodicals about the training goals of higher industrial schools, many of which involve the issue of aligning with job requirements. If we cannot achieve consistency between learning and application, it is indeed a great waste in cultural and educational construction. In fact, it is not that the professional education system is wrong, but that the setting of majors still needs to consider the needs and possibilities of the country more. Some graduates also feel self-righteous and unwilling to be "overqualified," using the excuse of not being happy with their current jobs because they are not using what they have learned. This shows that universities and colleges must strengthen ideological education for graduates. Dividing majors too finely and too much will to some extent unnecessarily disperse the strength of teachers. Therefore, in order to further improve the quality of teaching, the Ministry of Higher Education should carefully study the enrollment tasks and major settings during the Second Five-Year Plan period. The above are my personal views, and I welcome criticism and correction if they are not appropriate.

    谈高等学校的科学研究工作
    顾维精的发言
    我衷心同意毛主席在最近召开的扩大最高国务会议上对正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的报告，并且得到了极大的启发。我体会所谓矛盾是事物发展的根本原因，而发展就是对立面的斗争过程。在人民内部，对立面的斗争主要是新与旧、进步与落后、正确与谬误之间的斗争。即便是资产阶级作为一个阶级被消灭之后，资产阶级的思想意识仍然会相当长期地遗留下去，千百万人的习惯势力不可能随着它所由产生的物质存在（剥削阶级和私有制度）的消灭而立即消逝，社会上总会存在着进步、中间和落后分子。这种所谓进步分子是指工人阶级的思想意识较多，所谓中间和落后分子是指在立场、观点、方法、态度和作风上工人阶级的成份较少，资产阶级或其他非工人阶级的成份较多。所以，要使中间落后的不断向前进步，使进步的更加进步，是奔向社会主义以及共产主义社会的一项繁重而且艰巨的政治任务。党对知识分子所执行的政策完全体现了这种团结教育的精神实质。我体会到中国共产党所提出的与民主党派“长期共存，互相监督”的方针和学术思想上“百家争鸣”的方针是基于同一精神而为同一目的服务的。这个同一精神是要进一步发扬人民民主自由，同一目的是要调动一切力量来为社会主义建设事业服务。
    今年是最后并且全面完成第一个五年计划的一年，在此基础上又将进一步拟定发展我国国民经济的第二个五年计划。这样有效地从事空前规模的国家经济建设，显示着社会主义制度的无比优越性。由于中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导，由于坚定不移地学习苏联，也由于以苏联为首的人民民主阵营各兄弟国家真诚无私的帮助，我们经济发展的速率不仅远超出资本主义各国，甚至还胜过当初苏联在十月革命后相应时期的成就。在进行经济建设的同时，我们的政治建设和文化建设等也都配合得比较均衡，所以整个国家建设发展得很平稳，能够在帝国主义利用批判斯大林的错误所引起的国际逆流中屹立在捍卫马克思列宁主义道路的前列。
    虽然几年来，我国面貌一新，起了根本的变化，但在由落后的农业国转变为先进的工业国的路程上还只是迈前了一步，应该承认我们的科学技术水平一般很低。我们正处在一个所谓“原子革命”的技术改造的时代里，为了更快建立起我们自己的强大工业，党中央提出向科学进军的号召，紧接着拟定了十二年科学规划，要求在十二年左右的时期内迎头赶上或接近世界先进水平，是完全必要的。所以，继经济建设高潮之后，必然会有、而且也已经面临着一个文化建设的高潮。作为一个高等教育工作者，我愿意就这方面有关高等学校的一些问题谈谈我个人的看法。
    如上所述，向科学进军的目的，是为了要用更完善的技术建立和不断改造我们的工业、农业和交通运输业，改善人民的生活和健康水平。高等工业学校的任务既然要为国家培养工业建设所急需的人才，在已有基础上继续提高教学质量也就是直接贯彻向科学进军的号召，忽视教学、片面强调科学研究和学位论文工作是不切实际、舍本求末的做法。自然，为了要提高教学质量，高等学校的教师必须从事和教学相结合的科学研究，以便通过研究深入体会问题的本质和丰富教学内容。问题在于：教学改革后，由于高教事业的迅速发展，师资不足，教师的教学工作量一般都嫌过重，缺乏足够的时间展开科学研究。解决的途径应该调整教学工作量的标准，考虑在高等学校增加科学研究人员的编制，以便进一步改进教学工作的同时，可以在高等学校里大力开展科学研究。
    自从拟订国家科学规划以后，许多单位都新设了各级科学研究机构，但是我国过去技术科学的研究基础非常薄弱，更主要的是中上层的科学研究领导人才很缺乏，其中有相当大的一部分散处在各高等学校。如果就在一些有条件的学校里增加科学研究的编制，建立并加强科学研究的基础，培养学术研究的风气，以至形成我国的某些学派，会对我国科学水平的提高起更大的推动作用。同时，这种科学基地的建立，也可以使高等学校确实担负起培养正规研究生的任务，从而保证了师资和中级科学研究人员补充的一定质量。
    高等学校的科学研究计划原则上应该纳入国家总的科学规划。但高等学校毕竟担负着教学任务，特别在开展科学研究的初期，科学研究的方式必须多样化，各级教师应该实事求是，各按步伐，不宜强求一律。不能把科学研究看成高不可攀因而裹足不前。科学研究本来就是知识的不断积累、提炼和巩固的过程，不可能一切都事先准备好然后如意地一帆风顺，没有必要让青年教师过多地补基础。必须坚决贯彻勤俭办科学的方针。有关部门应该协助解决图书资料和制造设备的原材料供应问题。科学院和高教部可以考虑组织图书资料互通的一定办法和机构，逐步做到能够介绍并负责处理图书资料方面的问讯。
    最后，应该承认高等学校的教学改革几年来已经收到了肯定的效果，由于划分专业，根据需要进行教学，历年来的毕业生基本上能够更快地在工作岗位上负担生产任务，有力地支援了国家经济建设。然而，高等工业学校的培养工作至今还存在着一些缺点。最近，在报刊上看到了不少关于高等工业学校培养目标的讨论，很多涉及对准口径的问题。如果不能达到学用一致，的确是一种文教建设方面的极大浪费。其实，这不是专业教育制度不对，而是专业设置还需要更多地考虑国家的需要和可能。也有一些毕业生自以为是地不愿被“大才小用”，借口用非所学不安心于本位工作，这表明高等学校必须加强对毕业生的思想教育工作。专业划分得过细过多，在一定程度上会不必要地分散了教师的力量。所以，为了进一步提高教学质量，高教部应该慎重研究第二个五年计划期间的招生任务和专业设置。以上是我个人的看法，是否妥当请批评指正。
