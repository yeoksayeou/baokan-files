    The Drooping Red Arrow Will Surely Raise Its Head High
    ——Notes on the Animal Husbandry Hall of the National Agricultural Exhibition
    Wang Yiping
    Entering the Animal Husbandry Hall of the National Agricultural Exhibition, the guide took us to a map showing the distribution of several major livestock in China. Cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, donkeys, and camels each stood in their respective production areas. It's hard to find a place in China without livestock on the map. If chickens, ducks, geese, rabbits, and so on were added, the map would be even more crowded. Further ahead, on the display platforms were many beautiful carpets, leather shoes, and suitcases. In the glass cabinets were various furs, smoked chicken, pressed duck, milk, and pork that made people want to eat them at first sight, as well as combs, toothbrushes, belts… essential items in daily life. All these things come directly from livestock.
    The uses of livestock go far beyond these. Here are some photos: Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Xuanping County, Zhejiang Province, raised fourteen more cattle in 1955 than in 1953, accumulating over 14,000 dan more stable manure, resulting in an increase of 200 jin of grain per mu. The guide also told us that the manure from one cow can fertilize eight to twelve mu of land, and the manure from one pig can fertilize two to three mu of land. Without so many living "manure-making machines," it is unimaginable to guarantee increased agricultural production. There is also a chart showing the construction materials that can be exchanged for various livestock products through export. In terms of total numbers, livestock products exported from 1950 to 1956 can be exchanged for 9.79 million tons of steel. This figure is more than double China's planned steel production for 1957.
    About half of China's land is pastoral area, which is a good base for developing animal husbandry. In the excellent livestock and poultry farm of the Animal Husbandry Hall, we saw the Xinjiang fine-wool sheep with fine and abundant wool, the tall and handsome Sanhe horses, and the Tan sheep that produce Er Mao lambskins. These are all treasures of the pastoral areas. The Animal Husbandry Hall displays many photos and charts introducing the production situation in the pastoral areas and the beautiful lives of the herdsmen in recent years. After many herdsmen organized themselves, they settled down and no longer had to live a life of "following the water and grass." Children can also go to school. Machines such as grass cutters and cream separators, which they could not afford when working individually, are now available. Here is a photo taken at the Xinjiang Qianjin Pastoral Cooperative: a female cooperative member is extracting cream with a cream separator, and other cooperative members are using machines to chop grass. Their joy is transmitted to the audience through the photos.
    Many viewers were crowded in front of a small glass cabinet, which contained a basket of goose eggs and two plates of eggs. The eggs were as large as ordinary duck eggs, but the goose eggs were surprisingly large. One goose egg was about as long as an adult's palm, and the heaviest one weighed twelve taels (it takes seven or eight eggs sold in the Beijing market to weigh twelve taels). Experienced viewers estimated that the smallest one in the basket weighed more than half a jin each. People who have eaten this kind of egg automatically became guides, saying that one egg can make a large bowl of stir-fry, and a small eater cannot finish it alone. In the livestock and poultry farm, we saw the geese that lay these eggs - the Guangdong Lion Head goose, which is not much smaller than a small sheep. Neighbors of the Lion Head geese include the pure white Beijing ducks, the red-beaked and speckled Taiwanese ducks, and the Gaoyou ducks famous for producing double-yolk eggs.
    The livestock and poultry farm also has many excellent breeds cultivated in various places. A descendant of a local Tieling horse and an Ardennes horse, only two years old, is as tall as a large horse. This hybrid horse can pull 4,000 to 6,000 jin, while the local horse can only pull 2,000 to 3,000 jin. After the Mongolian cow is hybridized with the Dutch cow, the first generation can produce three times more milk than its mother.
    A sheep pen housed Mongolian sheep, which can only produce a little over 1.2 kilograms of wool each year, and the wool is also very coarse. However, if it is hybridized with the Xinjiang fine-wool sheep, it will be very different. Her neighbor lives such a descendant: the first generation of hybrids can produce 3.5 kilograms of wool each year; the second generation can produce 6 kilograms, and the wool becomes finer. This is why people who "drive sheep for thousands of miles" have to travel over mountains and rivers from Inner Mongolia to Xinjiang to transport sheep.
    Nanyang cattle from Henan and large yellow cattle from western Shandong also attract many viewers. People who are slightly shorter cannot see their backs when standing next to them. Two Nanyang cattle pull a double-wheeled double-furrow plow, and can cultivate seven or eight mu of land every day.
    There were the most female viewers outside the chicken coop. They were reluctant to leave after seeing these large and fat chickens. Ordinary large chickens weigh only two or three jin each, but the Pudong chicken from Jiangsu exhibited here weighs ten jin and six taels for the rooster and nine jin for the hen. The sign says: the heaviest one weighs twelve jin. The Xinlangshan chicken cultivated by the East China Agricultural Science Institute can lay up to 323 eggs a year. Local Langshan chickens can only lay 150 eggs a year.

    In the hall of the Comprehensive Pavilion, there are many charts with red arrows indicating the development of various products over the years. Most of the red arrows are rising in a straight line year by year. However, on a set of charts on animal husbandry, the red arrows seem to be reminding people: don't be blindly optimistic, you have to work harder! In this set of charts, there are development figures for several major livestock. From 1949 to 1952, the red lines on each chart are rising. In the period from 1952 to 1956, only horses and sheep rose; mules and cattle rose limitedly; the two red lines of the donkey seem to be flat, but the absolute numbers on the chart indicate that there were 10,000 fewer heads in 1956 than in 1952; the arrow of the pig is a bit downward, and it says that there were 89.77 million pigs in the country in 1952, while there were only 84.41 million in 1956. There is also a set of pictures in the Animal Husbandry Hall, which shows the increase in people's consumption of livestock products in recent years. Here, every number is rising. Not only is the consumption of beef, mutton, and pork more, but the consumption of milk, eggs, and woolen products is also rising rapidly. If you go to the Increase Production Measures Hall, you will see that the need for livestock for agricultural production is also increasing. This situation poses an important task to agricultural and animal husbandry producers: to vigorously develop animal husbandry, especially to develop cattle, donkeys, and pigs, in order to meet the needs of all aspects.
    The hall introduces many specific experiences in developing livestock. In addition to the experience of Songxiang Agricultural Cooperative in Shimen, which is famous throughout the country for raising pigs, there are also some experiences in developing draught animal production in some areas. In 1955, 89% of cows in Nanxian County, Hunan Province, were not pregnant; in 1956, many agricultural cooperatives began to attach importance to the breeding of draught cattle, selected and raised good stud bulls and breeding animals, and formulated breeding plans, and as a result, the non-pregnancy rate dropped to 21%. From 1953 to 1956, the mating, conception, and rearing rates of cows in Daxing Agricultural Cooperative in Changtu County, Liaoning Province, were 100% every year, and the conception rate of mares was about 80% every year. A complete set of photos introduces the experience of how to feed and manage the entire process from mating to the birth and growth of young animals. Many viewers engaged in animal husbandry work are very interested in this part.
    Insufficient feed is the main obstacle to developing livestock in many places at present. The variety of feeds displayed in the Animal Husbandry Hall shows the great potential in this regard. Locust leaves, apricot leaves, duckweed, Trapa natans... many things that are not noticed are good feeds. In addition to wild ones, there are also many high-yielding feeds that can be planted. The glass box contains water hyacinth, with green leaves like kale, with many fibrous roots extending below, more than a foot long. In Guangdong, the water hyacinth harvested from one mu of pond is enough for one hundred pigs to eat for a year. Alfalfa planted in the north can be harvested for several years after planting it once. One jin of alfalfa is equivalent to half a jin of sorghum in nutrients. There is a photo: gourds are hanging on the trellis, and one mu can harvest 40,000 to 60,000 jin. Yunnan also has a kind of potato peel tree, whose leaves can feed pigs; this tree is very strange, the more leaves you pick, the faster it grows.
   “Making fine feed from roughage” is also a science. After watching the displayed feed samples, one viewer said to his companion: "The peanut seedlings are chopped so finely, of course the cattle love to eat them. When we feed cattle, we put a large bundle of grass and let them gnaw on it by themselves, which wastes grass and the cattle don't get fat." On a glass box is displayed silage of corn stalks, and you can smell a fragrance when you get close. There is a painting on the wall: after drying one mu of corn stalks, it can only feed one cow for fifteen days; if it is silaged, it can feed one cow for sixty days, and the nutrients are better than drying. If all the corn stalks, sweet potato vines, peanut vines, and potato leaves produced in the country are silaged, it would be a considerable asset.
    Epidemic diseases are the biggest enemy of livestock. The achievements of animal husbandry and veterinary workers (including thousands of folk veterinarians) in fighting against livestock diseases are also displayed here. Rinderpest is an acute infectious disease with a high mortality rate; thanks to China's invention of the vaccine to eliminate rinderpest, and many prevention and control measures taken in recent years, there has been no rinderpest in the country in 1956. A set of photos captured the entire process of manufacturing this vaccine. Now many places can obtain materials locally and manufacture locally. Pig farmers are also most afraid of swine fever, and sometimes if one pig gets sick, all the pigs in a village will die. Heilongjiang Province formulated a plan last year to basically eliminate swine fever in the province within three years. Great achievements were made last year. Due to swine fever, 650,000 heads died in the province in 1955, which dropped to 200,000 heads in 1956. At the end of the hall, there are also photos of Chinese scientific workers trial-producing vaccines to prevent swine fever.
    After watching these, people are no longer worried about the slightly drooping arrow in the Comprehensive Hall. China has endless potential and broad prospects for developing animal husbandry, and these red arrows will surely raise their heads high!

    下垂的红箭头一定会昂起头来
    ——记全国农业展览会畜牧馆
    王一平
    走进全国农业展览会的畜牧馆，讲解员就把我们带到一幅地图前面，那是我国几种主要家畜的分布图，牛、马、羊、猪、驴、骆驼各自站在自己出产的地方。在图上几乎找不到我国哪个地方是没有家畜的。要是再把鸡、鸭、鹅、兔等等都放在上面，图上就会挤得更加满满的了。再往前走，展品台上放着许多漂亮的毯子、皮鞋、皮箱，玻璃柜里有各种皮毛，有使人一见就想吃的熏鸡、板鸭、牛奶、猪肉，还有日常生活中不可少的梳子、牙刷、皮带……。这些东西都直接来自牲畜身上。
    牲畜的用处远远不止这一些。这里有几张照片：浙江宣平县先锋农业社1955年比1953年多养了十四头牛，多积了一万四千多担厩肥，每亩就多收了二百斤粮食。讲解员还告诉我们：一头牛的粪尿可以肥田八亩到十二亩，一头猪的粪尿可以肥田两三亩。如果没有这么多活的“造肥机器”，要保证农业增产是不可想像的事。还有一块图版，表明各种畜产品出口能够换回来的建设物资。从总的数字看，1950年到1956年出口的畜产品，共可换回九百七十九万吨钢材。这个数字比我国1957年计划的产钢量要多出一倍多。
    在我国国土上大约有二分之一是牧区，那里是发展畜牧业的良好基地，我们在畜牧馆的优良畜禽场里，看到了产毛又细又多的新疆细毛羊，高大俊俏的三河马，还有产二毛羔皮的滩羊。这些都是牧区的宝贝。畜牧馆里陈列着许多照片和图表，介绍几年来牧区的生产情况和牧民的美好生活。许多牧民组织起来以后，定居下来，不用再过那种“逐水草而居”的生活了，儿童们也能上学了。打草机、奶油分离器等等在单干的时候买不起的机器，现在也有了。这里有在新疆前进牧业社拍的照片：一个女社员正在用奶油分离器提取奶油，另一些社员在用机器铡草。他们的愉快通过照片传给了观众。
    许多观众围在一个小玻璃柜前面，柜里放着一篮鹅蛋和两盘鸡蛋。鸡蛋有普通的鸭蛋那么大，鹅蛋却大得有点惊人。一只鹅蛋和成人的手掌差不多长，最重的一个有十二两重（在北京市场上卖的鸡蛋要七、八个才有十二两）。有经验的观众估计：那篮子里最小的每个也有半斤多重。吃过这种蛋的人就自动当了讲解员，说一个蛋能炒一大碗，饭量小的一个人还吃不完。在畜禽场里我们看到了生这种蛋的鹅——广东狮头鹅，它比一只小羊小不了多少。同狮头鹅作邻居的有羽毛纯白的北京鸭、红嘴花毛的台湾鸭和以产双黄蛋闻名的高邮鸭。
    畜禽场里还有各地培育成的许多优良品种，一匹铁岭当地马和阿尔登马杂交的后代，才两岁，个子就像一匹大马一样高大。这种杂交马能拉四千斤到六千斤，而当地马只能拉两三千斤。蒙古牛和荷兰牛杂交以后，第一代就能比她母亲多产三倍牛奶。
    一个羊栏里住着蒙古羊，这种羊每年只能剪一点二公斤羊毛，毛也很粗。可是，她如果同新疆细毛羊杂交以后，就大大不同了。她隔壁住着这样的后代：杂交第一代每年能剪毛三公斤半；第二代就能剪六公斤，而且毛还变细了。这就是“万里赶羊”的人们要跋山涉水从内蒙古到新疆去运羊的原因。
    河南南阳牛和山东西部大黄牛也吸引着很多观众。个子稍为矮一点的人，站在它们身旁就看不见它们的脊。两头南阳牛拉双轮双铧犁，每天可以耕七、八亩地。
    鸡舍外面女观众最多，看到这些又大又肥的鸡真舍不得离开。普通的大鸡每只不过二、三斤重，这里展出的江苏浦东鸡，公鸡十斤零六两，母鸡九斤重，说明牌上写着：最重的有十二斤。华东农业科学研究所培育的新狼山鸡，一年最多能生三百二十三个蛋。本地狼山鸡一年只能生一百五十个蛋。
        ×  ×  ×
    在综合馆大厅里，有许多图表用红色的箭头来标明各种产品历年的发展情况，大多数红箭头都是逐年直线向上升的。可是，关于畜牧业的一组图表上，红色箭头却仿佛在提醒人们：不要盲目乐观，还得加倍努力才行！在这组图表里，有几种主要家畜的发展数字，从1949年到1952年的一段，每个图上红线都是往上升的。在1952年到1956年的一段，只有马和羊是上升的；骡子和牛上升得有限；驴的两段红线看起来似乎是平的，图上的绝对数字却标明1956年比1952年少了一万头；猪的箭头有点朝下，上面写着1952年全国的猪是八千九百七十七万头，而1956年只有八千四百四十一万头。畜牧馆里还有一组图片，是几年来人民对畜产品消费量的增长情况。这里，每一种数字都是上升的。不光是牛、羊、猪肉消费得多，牛奶、蛋类、毛织品的消费量也上升得很快。若是再到增产措施馆里走一遭，就会看到农业增产对牲畜的需要量也是越来越多。这种现状向农牧业生产者提出了一个重要的任务：要大力发展畜牧业，特别是要发展牛、驴和猪，才能满足各方面的需要。
    馆里介绍了不少发展牲畜的具体经验。除了闻名全国的石门宋乡农业社养猪的经验之外，还有一些地区发展耕畜生产的经验。湖南南县在1955年有89％的母牛空怀；1956年许多农业社开始重视了耕牛繁殖工作，选养了好的种公牛和母畜，订了繁殖计划，结果空怀率下降到21％。辽宁省昌图县大兴农业社从1953年到1956年母牛每年的配种、受胎、育成率都是百分之百，母马每年的受胎率是80％左右。有整套的照片介绍了从配种到幼畜出生、成长的全部过程中，如何饲养管理的经验。许多做畜牧工作的观众，对这一部分很感兴趣。
    饲料不足是当前很多地方发展牲畜的主要障碍。畜牧馆里陈列的多种多样饲料，展示了这方面的巨大潜力。洋槐叶、杏树叶、浮萍、菱角禾……，许多不被人注意的东西都是好饲料。除了野生的以外，还有许多可以种植的高产量饲料。玻璃箱里装着水浮莲，碧绿的叶子像甘蓝菜，下面伸着许多须根，有一尺多长。在广东，一亩池塘所收的水浮莲足够一百头猪吃一年。北方栽的苜蓿，种一次就可以连收几年。一斤苜蓿能抵得上半斤高粱的养分。有一张照片：棚架上结着累累的佛手瓜，一亩能收四万斤到六万斤。云南还有一种薯皮树，叶子能喂猪；这种树很奇怪，叶子越摘越长得快。
   “粗料精做”也是一门学问。有一位观众看了展出的饲料样品之后，对他的同伴说：“花生秧子铡得这样细，牛当然爱吃了。我们喂牛，放一大抱草让它自己去啃，又浪费草，牛吃了也不上膘。”在一个玻璃匣子上放着青贮的玉米秸，走近的时候还可以闻到一阵清香。墙上有一幅画：一亩玉米秸晒干以后，只能供一头牛吃十五天；青贮起来就能供一头牛吃六十天，养分也比晒干的好。如果全国所产的玉米秸、甘薯藤、花生藤、马铃薯叶子都青贮起来，真是一笔可观的财产。
    疫病是牲畜最大的敌人。畜牧兽医工作者（包括千千万万民间兽医在内）对畜疫作斗争的成就也在这里展出了。牛瘟是一种死亡率很大的急性传染病；由于我国发明了消灭牛瘟的疫苗，这几年又采取了许多防疫措施，1956年全国就没有发生过牛瘟。有一组照片摄下了制造这种疫苗的整个过程。现在许多地方都可以就地取材，就地制造。养猪的人也最怕猪瘟，有时候一条猪得病，一村的猪都会死光。黑龙江省去年订了规划，全省要在三年内基本消灭猪瘟，去年一年就取得了很大的成绩，1955年全省由于猪瘟，死了六十五万头，1956年就下降到二十万头。馆的尽头，还有我国科学工作者试制预防猪瘟疫苗的照片。
    看完了这些以后，人们就不再为综合馆里那个有点下垂的箭头耽心了。我国发展畜牧业有着无穷的潜力和广阔的前途，这些红箭头一定会昂起头来的！
