　　Attention to Improving Pharmacy Work
　　Meng Mu'di's Speech

　　Following the inspections of national work by the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1956, group discussions were held. The medical and health issues group raised many problems currently existing in hospital pharmacies, requesting relevant departments to pay attention to them and solve them in a timely manner. As a pharmacy worker, I share the same sentiments on this issue. Pharmacy work is an inseparable part of the entire health work. It has indeed not been given enough attention in the past few years. Now that someone has raised it, drawing everyone's attention to improve it so that pharmacy work can better cooperate with medical services, improve medical effectiveness, and reduce patient suffering, this is very urgent and necessary.

　　Based on my personal, limited understanding and immature opinions, the unclear leadership relationship of pharmacies, low pay for pharmacists, lack of opportunities for further study, etc., are all objectively existing facts that urgently need to be resolved. However, there is another more important key issue that I would like to raise for reference by relevant parties.

　　I believe that the key issue in current pharmacy work is mainly due to the lack of the minimum necessary equipment, so that pharmacy dispensing personnel cannot dispense drugs according to operating procedures. The raw materials used to formulate drugs and the formulated prescriptions lack the equipment to test them, so it is naturally impossible to guarantee their quality, which seriously affects medical effectiveness. According to the statistical report of the Beijing Drug Inspection Institute's random inspection of prescriptions dispensed by municipal hospital pharmacies, only 25% of the prescriptions dispensed by pharmacies are qualified. That is to say, of the average of 40,000 prescriptions dispensed daily, only 10,000 are qualified, and the remaining 30,000 are unqualified. We can clearly imagine how serious the impact of these 30,000 unqualified prescriptions will be on medical effectiveness. In capitalist countries, if unqualified prescriptions are found, they are dealt with through legal procedures. In our socialist system, it should be said that this phenomenon should not exist. If we try to explore the fundamental reason why this phenomenon arises and persists for a long time, it is caused by the old society's corrupt ideological consciousness of "valuing doctors and not valuing medicine." If we do not correct it in time, the level of medical care in our country will never be improved and will never reach the international level. The seriousness of the problem lies here. Therefore, hospital leaders and local health administrative departments should pay attention to this issue and list it as one of the key points of work inspection. Now, based on my personal superficial understanding, I would like to put forward a few suggestions for improvement for everyone's reference:

　　First, the lack of pharmacy equipment, insufficient manpower, poor working conditions, and weak technical leadership are the fundamental reasons why dispensing quality cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, it is hoped that relevant leading departments should adjust staffing, replenish manpower, add equipment, improve the working environment, and strengthen technical leadership according to the specific circumstances and actual needs of hospital pharmacy work, so that pharmacy staff have the conditions to dispense according to operating procedures. In this way, dispensing quality can be guaranteed and medical effectiveness can be improved.

　　Second, due to the particularity and complexity of pharmacy work, in addition to general administrative leadership, the business and technical aspects should be under the unified leadership of the Pharmaceutical Administration Department of the Ministry of Health. This will improve and implement technical improvements and related laws and policies (such as the management of narcotic and highly toxic drugs, etc.). Some pharmacy workers have reflected that in order to improve and solve a series of problems existing in pharmacy work, such as the pharmacy work system, management methods, the treatment, rank, and promotion system of pharmaceutical workers, the connection between pharmacies and relevant medical colleges, experience exchange, technical guidance, professional training, and answers to difficult questions, etc., the Ministry of Health is requested to consider convening a national conference of pharmacy workers' representatives to study and discuss the above issues. I think the Ministry of Health should consider this suggestion, because the most reliable and practical way to improve future work is through practical experience, and pharmacy work is no exception.

　　Third, from the perspective of the trend of urban district medical care and drug supply, gradually transitioning to central pharmacies and central warehouses is a new direction for the development of urban pharmacies. In addition to pharmacies attached to larger hospitals, other smaller medical and preventive institutions such as outpatient clinics, treatment centers, and prevention and treatment centers, etc., if each has its own pharmacy and warehouse, it is undoubtedly a waste of manpower and equipment, and it is too dispersed, which is inconvenient. It is better to concentrate the dispensing of medicines in nearby central pharmacies. The advantage of a central pharmacy is that it can concentrate manpower and ensure dispensing quality. The establishment of a central warehouse can enable medical equipment and drugs to be centrally controlled, uniformly distributed, and flexibly used. As for whether the method of establishing central pharmacies and warehouses can be tried out as a priority and whether it has practical value, it is hoped that relevant health leaders will consider it in detail. This is my initial view, and I would like to ask all the committee members for their criticism and guidance on its feasibility.

### 注意改进药房工作　孟目的的发言

　　注意改进药房工作
　　孟目的的发言
    1956年全国人民代表暨政治协商委员对全国各项工作进行视察之后，举行了分组座谈会。其中医药卫生问题组曾提出了目前医院药房方面存在的许多问题，提请有关部门予以重视并及时加以解决。我是一个药学工作者，对此问题有所同感。因为药房工作是整个卫生工作中的一个不可分割的环节，过去几年来确实没有重视，现在既然有人提出来引起大家的注意，从而加以改进，使药房工作能够很好的配合医疗业务，提高医疗效果，减少患者的痛苦，这是非常迫切和必要的。
    据我个人片面的了解和不成熟的看法，药房的领导关系不明确、药师待遇偏低、没有进修的机会等等问题，说起来固然都是客观存在的事实，亟需加以解决，但还有一个比较更为重要的关键性问题，我想提出来供有关方面的参考。
    我认为目前药房工作中的关键问题，主要是由于缺乏最低限度的设备，以致药房调剂人员不能按照操作规程调剂药品，调配药品所用的原料和配成的处方既没有设备加以化验，当然无法保证它的质量，也就严重的影响医疗效果。我们根据北京市药检所抽验本市医院药房调配处方的统计报告，其中指出药房调配的处方只有25％是及格的，也就是说：每日平均调配的四万处方中仅有一万件及格，其余三万件均不及格。我们可以很清楚的推想到这三万多个调配不及格的处方对于医疗效果的影响将是何等严重。在资本主义国家里如果发现处方调配不及格，是要以法律程序来处理，而在我们社会主义体系的国家里，应当说，这种现象就不应该存在。我们试一推究这种现象的所以产生和长期存在的根本原因，是由于旧社会“重医不重药”的腐朽思想意识所造成，如果现在还不及时加以纠正，我国的医疗水平将永远不能提高，永远达不到国际水平，问题的严重也就在这里。因此，对于这个问题，不论医院领导和各地卫生行政主管部门都应该予以重视，列为工作检查重点之一。现在就我个人的粗识浅见，提出几点改进的意见，供大家参考：
    一、药房设备缺乏、人力不足、工作条件恶劣、技术领导薄弱，是不能保证调剂质量的根本原因，因此，希望有关领导部门应根据医院药房工作的具体情况和实际需要，调整编制，充实人力，添置设备，改善工作环境，加强技术领导，使药房工作人员有条件能够按照操作规程进行调配，这样，调剂质量才能保证，医疗效果才能提高。
    二、由于药房工作有它自己的特殊性和复杂性，除了一般行政领导之外，业务和技术方面，应由卫生部药政司统一领导，这样对于技术的改进和有关法令政策的执行（例如麻醉毒剧药的管理等等），才能得以提高与贯彻。有些药房工作者反映，为了改进和解决药房工作中存在的一系列问题：例如药房工作制度，管理办法，药工人员的待遇、等级及晋级制度，药房与有关医药院校方面的联系，经验交流，技术指导，专业进修，以及疑难问题解答等等，请卫生部考虑召开全国药房工作者代表大会，以便研究讨论上列各项问题。我认为这个意见，卫生部应该考虑一下，因为一切的事情只有通过实际的经验来改进今后工作才是最可靠而又最切合实际的办法，药房工作当然也不例外。
    三、从城市分区医疗和药品供应的趋势来看，逐步过渡到市中心药房和中心仓库是城市药房发展的一个新的方向。除较大医院附设药房外，其他各门诊部、诊疗所、防治所等等较小的医疗预防机构，如果各有各的药房，各有各的仓库，无疑的是人力和设备的浪费，而且过于分散，诸多不便，不如就近集中在中心药房配药。中心药房的优点是可以集中人力，保证调配质量。中心仓库的设置，可以使医疗器械和药物得以集中掌握，统一分配，灵活运用。至于建立中心药房和仓库的办法是否可以重点试行，有无实际的价值，还是希望有关卫生领导方面详细考虑。这是个人初步的看法，是否可行提请诸位委员批评指教。
