Xinhua News Agency, March 29th—The national joint state-private industrial transformation symposium, which concluded today, determined that the main tasks for national joint state-private industrial enterprises in 1957 are to focus on increasing production and practicing economy, improving production, further improving enterprise management and restructuring work, and continuing to strengthen the transformation of private personnel.

　　The symposium first studied the issue of joint state-private factories launching the increase production and practice economy campaign, believing that in 1956, joint factories had achieved great success in production, restructuring, and transformation work. These victories will help overcome difficulties such as insufficient raw materials in this year's production. In this year's increase production and practice economy campaign, all forces must be mobilized. Based on the characteristics of joint factories, their enthusiasm and flexibility should be brought into play to overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials and production arrangements, and lay the foundation for normal production in the future.

　　After studying some specific methods to solve production difficulties, the symposium pointed out that in order to meet the requirements of increasing production and practicing economy, some factories should appropriately adjust labor organization and management methods. Some factories can set up retail departments to undertake repair services, accepting jobs and repairing them on the spot, or they can provide door-to-door repairs.

　　The symposium pointed out that in the increase production and practice economy campaign, special attention must be paid to ensuring and improving product quality, emphasizing safe production, and saving production management costs.

　　The symposium focused on studying the issue of strengthening the management of joint factories. The representatives attending the meeting believed that in addition to implementing the mass line in joint factories and relying on the masses to run enterprises well, factories in large and medium-sized cities should be managed in categories. The criteria for classification should be based on the size of the factory, combined with the existing management foundation, technical conditions, equipment conditions, and management methods. According to the category of the factory, it should be managed by the industrial bureau or professional company; for the numerous small factories that calculate their own profits and losses, they can be managed by joint management agencies (i.e., central factories or grassroots small companies). The factories in each province and autonomous region are managed separately by the industrial departments of the industrial halls and provincial-level cities, autonomous prefectures, and counties; the factories managed by the special commissioner's offices, autonomous prefectures, and counties mainly understand the completion of production plans, strengthen financial management, and cooperate with local party committees and trade unions to strengthen political and ideological work.

　　In response to the current shortcomings in enterprise management, such as too many reports, too many meetings, and complicated procedures, the symposium specifically studied simplifying reports, meetings, organizational structures, and clearly stipulating the authority of factories.

　　The symposium also studied the achievements and shortcomings of the economic restructuring work of joint ventures last year. It was believed that factories that have done a good job in restructuring should continue to be rectified and improved; those with problems in restructuring should actively find ways to solve them; and if factories that should not have been merged have been merged, if conditions permit decentralization, they should be appropriately decentralized in a planned and step-by-step manner; especially those factories where unified calculation of profits and losses is inappropriate should be changed to decentralized calculation of profits and losses as much as possible. The symposium believed that these tasks are very detailed and complex, and all localities should carefully study, fully prepare, and conduct them after being approved by the provincial and municipal industrial halls and bureaus. In general, no more factories will be merged this year, and joint factories that have adopted the form of "association" will generally no longer implement unified calculation of profits and losses. A few factories in certain areas that really must be merged or linked together to calculate profits and losses uniformly should be reviewed and approved by the provincial and municipal people's committees in advance.

　　Finally, the symposium discussed the issue of continuing to strengthen the unity, education, and transformation of private personnel with enterprises as the base.

　　This symposium was jointly convened in Beijing by the Fourth Office of the State Council and the Ministry of Textile Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, and the Ministry of Food Industry.

### 全国公私合营工业确定今年主要任务　开展增产节约运动改进企业管理

　　全国公私合营工业确定今年主要任务
　　开展增产节约运动改进企业管理
    据新华社29日讯  今天结束的公私合营工业改造座谈会确定，1957年全国公私合营工业的主要任务是以开展增产节约运动、搞好生产为中心，进一步改进企业的管理工作和改组工作并继续加强对私方人员的改造。
    这个座谈会首先研究了公私合营工厂开展增产节约运动问题，认为1956年合营工厂在生产和改组、改造工作上都已取得了很大的成绩，这些胜利将有利于克服今年生产上的原料不足等困难。今年在增产节约运动中必须动员一切力量，根据合营工厂的这些特点，发挥其积极性和灵活性，克服原材料不足和生产安排中的困难，并为今后正常生产打下基础。
    这个座谈会在研究了一些解决生产困难的具体办法后指出，为了适应增产节约的要求，有些工厂应该适当调整劳动组织和经营方式，有些工厂可以设立承接修理业务的门市部，随接活、随修理；也可以上门修理。
    座谈会指出，在增产节约运动中，必须特别注意保证和提高产品质量，重视安全生产，节约生产管理费用。
    座谈会着重研究了加强合营工厂的管理问题，到会代表认为除了在合营工厂内贯彻群众路线，依靠群众办好企业外，对大中城市的工厂应当进行分类管理。分类的标准以工厂的规模大小为主，结合现有的管理基础、技术条件、设备条件、经营方式等情况来考虑。根据工厂的类别，分别由工业局或专业公司管理；对那些为数众多的、各自计算盈亏的小厂，可以由联管机构（即中心厂或基层小公司）管理。各省、自治区的工厂由工业厅及省辖市、自治州、县等工业管理部门分别管理；专署、自治州、县管理的工厂，主要是了解生产计划的完成情况，加强财务管理，配合当地党委和工会加强政治思想工作。
    座谈会针对着目前企业管理上存在的表报多、会议多、手续繁等缺点，具体研究了精简报表、会议、组织机构和明确规定工厂的权限等问题。
    座谈会还研究了去年合营企业经济改组工作的成绩和缺点，认为目前对改组工作做得好的工厂应该继续加以整顿和提高；对改组中尚有问题的应该积极设法解决；对不应该合并而合并了的工厂，如果有条件分散，应该有计划、有步骤地适当分散；特别是那些统一计算盈亏不妥的工厂，应该尽可能地改为分散计算盈亏。座谈会认为，这些工作都是很细致复杂的，各地应该慎重研究，充分准备，并经过省、市工业厅、局批准后再进行。各地今年一般不再并厂，已采取“联”的形式的合营工厂，也一般不再实行统一计算盈亏。某些地区的少数工厂实在必须并厂或联起来统一计算盈亏的应该事先经过省市人民委员会审查批准。
    座谈会最后讨论了继续以企业为基地加强对私方人员的团结、教育和改造问题。
    这个座谈会是国务院第四办公室和纺织工业部、轻工业部、食品工业部联合在北京召开的。
