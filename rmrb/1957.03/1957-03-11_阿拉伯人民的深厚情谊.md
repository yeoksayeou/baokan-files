The Profound Friendship of the Arab People
By our correspondent Jiang Yuanchun

    The Egyptian Minister of Religious Endowments, Mr. Bakuri, said when he received the Chinese journalists delegation that common hopes and sufferings link China and Egypt together. The Syrian Minister of State and Acting Minister of Defense, Mr. Azem, expressed the same view when he received us. Mr. Azem and the Chief of Staff of the Syrian Army, General Niram El-Din, both said that they felt they could speak frankly with the Chinese because we are all people of Eastern countries and have no other purpose than to strengthen friendly relations and mutual understanding. But when dealing with people from Western countries, they always have to be careful because Western countries always want to probe for something for their own benefit.

    Indeed, during our nearly three months of visiting the Arab world, we deeply felt the profound affection of the people of Arab countries for the Chinese people, and this affection has developed in the common struggle against imperialist aggression.

    In Egypt, we were received with extremely friendly and warm hospitality. President Nasser received us in an approachable and informal manner and had a frank conversation with us for an hour and a half. Many ministers of the Egyptian government also took the time to receive us and patiently answer the questions we raised. The Egyptian government also took the initiative to invite us to visit an arsenal and showed us wartime activities and measures, expressing great trust in us. In order to enable us to have a pleasant New Year, the Egyptian Director of Information, Mr. Hatem, specially invited us to a nightclub to spend New Year's Eve, even though he himself is a Muslim and does not celebrate this Christian Gregorian New Year, and he always has to stay in the office until very late every night. Throughout our visit to Egypt, a photographer followed us, filming our visit, and finally gave us a large pile of photos as a memento of our visit to Egypt.

    The Egyptian press held a reception especially for the visit of our Chinese journalists, which is said to be unprecedented. Many friends from the press came to see us, especially Mr. Sabri, a journalist from the New Crescent Publishing Company, and Mr. Hamroush of the Republic Daily, who had visited China. Sabri is the Secretary-General of the Egyptian Journalists Association. He does not speak English well, nor is he very eloquent, and he is a bachelor. But he came to see us again and again, and personally arranged and cooked an Egyptian meal for us at his home. When we left Cairo, he embraced us with tears in his eyes. Mr. Hamroush never forgot the scene he saw in Beijing of the Chinese people supporting Egypt's resistance to aggression, and always called the Chinese people "brothers and friends in China." The editor-in-chief of the Republic Daily, Mr. Sadat, also always referred to Comrade Chen Jiakang, the Chinese Ambassador to Egypt, as "my friend and brother" when he spoke to us.

    Whether in Cairo, Ismailia and Port Said, Alexandria, or Luxor and Aswan, in schools, factories, hospitals, villages, or museums, we felt this friendly affection of the Egyptian people. The admiring phrase "Sini Shabei" (People's China) and surprised eyes accompanied us everywhere. In Luxor, we bought some antique-style heads made of clay by local farmers at a reasonable price. After an unfamiliar person on the roadside asked and understood the price we paid, he said in English, "Not expensive, this is sold to you Chinese people. If it were Americans, it would be an antique, at least forty pounds!" When we were riding in a horse-drawn carriage from Karnak Temple to Luxor Temple, two female students on the roadside raised their hands and shouted: "Zhou Enlai!"

    As soon as you arrive in Syria, you will find that there is almost a "China fever" here. Like in Egypt, people shake hands with you not in the polite, light diplomatic way, but tightly, making your hand ache. Deputies, lawyers, and journalists who have been to China are spreading the achievements of New China everywhere, treating us Chinese journalists as their old friends, and visiting us again and again. And more people are hoping to visit China, inquiring about how much it costs to go to China. "People's Daily" is a very famous newspaper here, because the TASS branch here has forwarded many commentaries from "People's Daily" and reprinted the full text of the article "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat." This article has been reprinted in full in many progressive and independent newspapers. A magazine in Hama ordered a copy of "People's Daily," although they could not understand Chinese, they reprinted the cartoons on the international page. In order to understand China, many people are concerned about the issue of the Latinization of Chinese, while repeatedly urging not to lose China's inherent culture because of Latinization.

    On the street newsstands, you can see the French version of "People's Pictorial" placed in the most prominent position, while American magazines are placed in the corners inside. Syrian friends are always complaining to us that they cannot see Chinese publications, not to mention Arabic ones, even French ones are very few. And the foreign language used here is mainly French. Since Japanese businessmen have recently been actively engaged in activities here, people often mistake us for Japanese. But when they know we are Chinese, they become very enthusiastic. Once we went to the Damascus market, the owner of a handicraft shop invited us into his shop, preparing to rip us off. But then a person came in and spoke to the owner in Arabic for a while. We only understood the words "Sihua Fa Sini Shabei" (People's China journalist). The owner showed a suddenly realized, rather embarrassed expression, and we laughed and left.

    Once we were crossing a busy road in Damascus. Other people had passed, but I was standing in the traffic island in the middle of the road, waiting for the endless stream of vehicles to pass. A military vehicle stopped abruptly in front of me, and the driver smiled and waved for me to pass. I smiled and waved for him to go first. After the two of us smiled and waved politely for a while, he finally let me pass first. This scene of humility and courtesy made the pedestrians and traffic police laugh.

    When we visited northwestern Syria, we Chinese journalists were treated with extremely friendly and warm hospitality like state guests. The governors of Homs, Aleppo, Latakia and other provinces not only received us, but also specially hosted banquets for us. They also made speeches at the banquets to express their welcome. In Aleppo, deputies and journalists who had visited China held tea parties and home banquets for us respectively, and the governor and the local military commander attended as guests. When we left Aleppo, the Director of Information of Aleppo sent us four kilometers out of the city. In Latakia, before we had time to visit the governor, he came to see us at the hotel first, and accompanied us to an evening party of an amateur music club, and the next day he accompanied us to visit an agricultural school. Their conversations were frank, sincere and straightforward, fully demonstrating extremely friendly feelings and trust in the Chinese people, making us feel completely among our own people.

    On our way back to Damascus from Latakia along the Mediterranean coast, we were invited to have lunch at the home of Mr. Dandashi, a deputy who had visited China. Mr. Dandashi's 75-year-old father came out to greet us and prepared a very delicious Arabic meal for us. He forced us to eat a lot of roasted, very tender pigeons, and also forced us to eat three bananas each, saying that this was equivalent to visiting three families. But he was still saddened to tears because he had not had time to give us a grander welcome and reception. After our repeated explanations, he still felt sorry.

    I also cannot forget the warm reception of our Syrian press colleagues. In Homs, the first question a journalist asked us was how Chairman Mao's health was. He said he asked this question because the Arab people regarded Chairman Mao's health as an extremely important matter closely related to them. In Aleppo, a newspaper editor in his fifties embraced me and kissed my cheek, using the etiquette of close friends meeting in the Arab world. In order to attend the farewell reception held by our embassy in Syria for our delegation, many journalists came from Aleppo and Hama, and three journalists came especially from Beirut, Lebanon. The affection of these friends is something we will never forget.

    As tourists, we only spent one day in Beirut, Lebanon. Even under the current political situation in Lebanon, we still felt the Lebanese people's friendly feelings towards the Chinese people. We met with the Lebanese press. They learned about the Chinese press and Chinese political parties, and also introduced us to the situation in Lebanon. They told us that there is a saying in one sect of Islam in Lebanon that after a person dies, his soul goes to China. They joked that this is probably why China has such a large population. They also said they hope to go to China to see it alive, rather than waiting until they die. Due to the arrangements of the Lebanese press, we were unexpectedly introduced to the Lebanese Prime Minister Solah. Solah praised the patriotism of the Chinese national anthem, saying that Lebanon should learn from China in this regard. He repeatedly mentioned his meeting with Premier Zhou Enlai in Bandung, and quoted an Arab proverb saying that if two people eat salt and bread together, they will always be friends. The Lebanese press friends want to report on our hasty visit in a big way. They said they want to show the Americans.

    Although we only visited Egypt, Syria, and Beirut in Lebanon, we also had some contact with official and non-official people from other Arab countries. We found that they also have friendly feelings towards the Chinese people. The Libyan Ambassador to Egypt welcomed us to visit Libya at a reception. The Yemeni Minister to Egypt introduced us to the British aggression against Yemen in a meeting and thanked the Chinese people for their support to the Arab people. The Saudi Arabian Ambassador to Syria also had a very friendly conversation with us at a reception. Several Sudanese journalists became good friends with us during our visit to Port Said. It is said that the Sudanese anti-imperialist front's newspaper "Al-Maidan" is preparing to publish a special issue introducing China.

    Peace and friendship are what the people of Arab countries and peace-loving people all over the world cherish and strive for. Our visit to the Middle East makes us even more convinced that the Chinese people, who are working hard to defend world peace and friendly cooperation between the people of all countries, will gain more friends in the world.

    阿拉伯人民的深厚情谊
    本报记者　蒋元椿
    埃及的宗教基金部长巴库里先生在接见中国新闻工作者代表团的时候，曾经说，共同的希望和痛苦把中埃两国联系在一起。叙利亚的国务部长兼代理国防部长阿泽姆先生，在接见我们的时候也表示了同样的意见。阿泽姆先生和叙利亚陆军参谋长尼拉姆·埃丁将军都说，他们觉得同中国人在一起可以开诚相见，因为我们都是东方国家的人，我们之间除了加强友好关系和相互了解之外，别无其他目的。而同西方国家的人在一起的时候，他们总得谨慎小心，因为西方国家总是想为它们自己的利益刺探一点什么东西。
    的确，在我们在阿拉伯世界访问的将近三个月之中，我们深深感到阿拉伯各国人民对中国人民的深厚的情意，而这种情意是在反对帝国主义侵略的共同斗争中发展起来的。
    在埃及，我们受到了极其友好热情的接待。纳赛尔总统以一种平易近人、不拘形式的方式接见了我们，同我们作了一个半小时的坦率的谈话。埃及政府的许多部长也抽空接见我们，不厌其烦地回答我们所提出的问题。埃及政府还主动邀请我们参观了一个兵工厂，请我们参观了抗战的活动和措施，对我们表示了极大的信任。为了使我们能够过一个愉快的新年，埃及的新闻局长哈梯姆先生特地邀请我们到夜总会里去度过除夕，虽然他自己是伊斯兰教徒，并不过这个基督教的公历新年，而且他每天晚上总是要到很晚才能离开办公室。在我们访问埃及的整个期间，一位摄影员始终跟着我们，给我们拍摄访问的镜头，最后送给了我们一大堆照片，作为我们访问埃及的纪念。
    埃及新闻界为我们中国记者的访问特地举行了一次招待会，据说这是前所未有的。许多新闻界的朋友来看我们，特别是访问过中国的新月出版公司的记者萨布里先生和共和国报的哈姆路许先生。萨布里是埃及记者协会的秘书长，他的英文讲得不好，也不大会说话，是个单身汉。可是他却一再地来看我们，并且张罗着亲自动手，在他家里请我们吃了一餐埃及饭。在我们离开开罗的时候，他拥抱着我们，眼眶里含满了泪水。哈姆路许先生念念不忘他在北京看到的中国人民支持埃及反抗侵略的场面，总是把中国人民称做“在中国的兄弟和朋友们”。共和国报的总编辑萨达特先生在同我们谈到中国驻埃及大使陈家康同志的时候，也总是把他称作是“我的朋友和兄弟”。
    无论是在开罗，在伊士美利亚和塞得港，在亚历山大港或是卢克索和阿斯旺，在学校里、工厂里、医院里、农村里、博物馆里，我们都感到了埃及人民这种友好的情意。“西尼·夏贝”（人民中国）这句充满钦慕之情的话和惊喜的眼光，到处都伴随着我们。在卢克索，我们以不贵的价钱买了一些当地农民用泥制成的仿古头像。路旁一个不相识的人问明了我们付的价钱以后用英语说，“不贵，这是卖给你们中国人，如果是美国人，那就是古董，起码四十镑！”当我们坐着马车蹄声得得地从卡尔那克神庙向卢克索神庙驰去的时候，路旁两个女学生向我们举手高呼：“周恩来！”
    一到叙利亚，你就发现这里有着一种几乎可以说是“中国热”。像在埃及一样，人们同你握手并不是用那种彬彬有礼的轻轻的外交方式，而是紧紧地握得你的手发痛。到过中国的议员、律师、新闻记者都在到处宣传新中国的成就，把我们这些中国记者当成他们的老朋友，一再地来拜访我们。而更多的人在希望能够到中国去访问，打听到中国去需要多少费用。“人民日报”在这里是很出名的报纸，因为塔斯社在这里的分社转发了不少“人民日报”的评论，并且全文转发了“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”这篇文章。这篇文章在许多进步的和独立的报纸上被全文转载。哈马市的一家杂志订了一份“人民日报”，虽然他们看不懂中文，可是他们却转载了国际版上面的漫画。为了要了解中国，许多人都关心地询问着中文拉丁化的问题，同时又一再叮嘱不要因为拉丁化而丧失了中国的固有文化。
    在街上的书报摊上，可以看到法文版的“人民画报”被放在外面最显著的位置，而美国杂志却放在里面的角落里。叙利亚朋友们老是向我们抱怨看不到中国的出版物，不要说阿拉伯文的，就是法文的也很少。而这里应用的外国语主要是法文。由于日本商人最近在这里积极展开活动，人们常常把我们当成是日本人。但当他们一知道我们是中国人以后，就显得非常热情。有一次我们去逛大马士革市场，一家卖工艺品的铺子的老板把我们邀到他铺子里，准备敲我们一记竹杠。可是跟着就进来了一个人，用阿拉伯语同老板谈了一会，我们只听懂了“西哈法·西尼·夏贝”（人民中国的记者）这几个字。老板显出恍然大悟、颇为尴尬的表情，我们也就大笑而退。
    有一次我们通过大马士革市内一条热闹的马路，旁的人都走过去了，只有我站在马路中间的避车道上，等不绝的车辆过去，一辆军车在我面前戛然停住，开车的军人微笑挥手让我通过。我微笑着挥手请他先行。两个人这样微笑挥手谦让了一番，最后还是让我先通过。这幅谦恭揖让图，引得行人和交通警察都笑了起来。
    在我们到叙利亚的西北部访问的时候，我们这几个中国记者受到了国宾一样的极其友好热情的款待。荷姆斯、阿勒颇、拉塔基亚等省的省长不但接见了我们，而且都特地设宴款待我们。在宴会席上他们还都发表演说表示欢迎。在阿勒颇，曾经访问过中国的议员和新闻工作者为我们分别举行了茶会和家宴，省长和当地的军区司令分别出席作陪。在我们离开阿勒颇的时候，阿勒颇的新闻处长一直送我们到出城四公里的地方。在拉塔基亚，我们还没有来得及去拜访省长，他就先到旅馆里来看我们，并且陪着我们参加了一个业余的音乐俱乐部的晚会，第二天又陪着我们参观了一所农业学校。他们的谈话都是坦白、诚恳而且直率，充分表现了对中国人民极其友好的感情和信任，使我们觉得完全是在自己人中间。
    在我们从拉塔基亚沿着地中海边回大马士革途中，我们应邀在访问过中国的议员丹达希先生家里吃了一顿午饭。丹达希先生的七十五岁的老父亲出来招待我们，为我们办了一桌非常好吃的阿拉伯饭。他强迫我们吃了许多烤得非常鲜嫩的鸽子，还强迫我们每人吃了三只香蕉，说这样就等于到了三家人家。可是他还因为没有来得及给我们更盛大的欢迎和招待而难过得流下泪来。经过我们一再解释，他还是觉得抱歉。
    我也不能忘记叙利亚新闻界同业们对我们的热情的接待。在荷姆斯，一位记者向我们提出的第一个问题，就是毛主席的健康如何。他说他提这个问题，是因为阿拉伯人民把毛主席的健康看作是同他们切身有关的极重要的事情。在阿勒颇，一位五十多岁的报纸主编，用阿拉伯世界中知心朋友见面时的礼节，拥抱住我并且亲吻我的面颊。为了参加我国驻叙利亚大使馆为我们代表团送行而举行的招待会，许多记者从阿勒颇、哈马赶来，还有三位记者特地从黎巴嫩的贝鲁特赶来。这些朋友们的情意，是我们所永远不能忘的。
    我们作为旅客，在黎巴嫩的贝鲁特只玩了一天。即使在黎巴嫩目前的政治情况下，我们也仍然感到黎巴嫩人民对中国人民的友好感情。我们会见了黎巴嫩的新闻界。他们向我们了解了中国新闻界和中国的政党情况，也向我们介绍了黎巴嫩的情况。他们告诉我们说，在黎巴嫩的伊斯兰教的一派有一种说法，说是人死了以后，他的灵魂就到中国去了。他们开玩笑说，这大概就是中国人口特别多的缘故。他们还说希望能活着到中国去看看，而不是等到死了以后。由于黎巴嫩新闻界的安排，我们出乎意料地被引见了黎巴嫩总理索勒哈。索勒哈称赞中国国歌的爱国主义精神，说黎巴嫩在这方面应该向中国学习。他一再提到他同周恩来总理在万隆的会见，并且引用阿拉伯的谚语说，两个人在一起吃了盐和面包，他们就永远都是朋友。黎巴嫩新闻界的朋友要把我们这次匆匆的访问大事报道。他们说，他们要做给美国人看看。
    我们虽然只访问了埃及、叙利亚和黎巴嫩的贝鲁特，可是我们同其他阿拉伯国家的官方和非官方的人士也有所接触。我们发现，他们对中国人民也有着友好的感情。利比亚驻埃及的大使，在一次招待会上表示欢迎我们去访问利比亚。也门驻埃及的公使在一次会面中向我们介绍了英国侵略也门的情形，并且感激中国人民对阿拉伯人民的支持。沙特阿拉伯驻叙利亚的大使，也在一次招待会上同我们作了一次极为友好的谈话。苏丹的几名记者在我们访问塞得港的过程中同我们成了很好的朋友。据说，苏丹的反帝阵线的机关报“厄尔·梅旦”报，正在准备出一期介绍中国的专刊。
    和平与友谊，这是阿拉伯各国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民所珍视和争取的东西。我们在中东的访问使我们更加相信，为保卫世界和平和各国人民之间的友好合作而努力的中国人民，将会在世界上得到更多的朋友。
