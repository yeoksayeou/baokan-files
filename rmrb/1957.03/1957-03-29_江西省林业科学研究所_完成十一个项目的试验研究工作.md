　　Jiangxi Provincial Forestry Science Institute
　　Completes Experimental Research Work on Eleven Projects

    This newspaper reports that since its establishment in August of last year, the Jiangxi Provincial Forestry Science Institute has overcome difficulties such as insufficient equipment, weak technical strength, and lack of experience. In the second half of last year, it completed experimental research work on a total of eleven projects, including seeds, seedling cultivation, afforestation, and forest protection management. The institute has made preliminary conclusions on production technology issues such as the identification, storage, and preservation of seed quality for several major tree species in the province, as well as reasonable tending of young forests and prevention and control of forest and fruit tree diseases and insect pests. This will play a guiding and promoting role in the province's forestry production in the future.

    In order to strengthen forestry scientific research work, the Jiangxi Provincial Forestry Science Institute is implementing the principle of "active research, key experiments, summarizing experience, and comprehensive guidance," enriching various experimental equipment, strengthening ties with relevant departments, widely exchanging experiences, and more systematically studying and disseminating forestry scientific and technological knowledge, in order to effectively guide and promote the development of the province's forestry construction.

　　江西省林业科学研究所
　　完成十一个项目的试验研究工作
    本报讯  江西省林业科学研究所从去年8月成立以来，克服了设备不足，技术力量薄弱和缺乏经验等等困难，在去年下半年完成了种子、育苗、造林、森林保护管理等共十一个项目的试验研究工作。这个研究所对全省几种主要林木种子品质的鉴定、贮藏保管，以及合理进行幼林抚育，防治森林、果树病虫害等生产技术问题，已作出了初步的结论。这对今后全省林业生产，将起指导和推动作用。
    为了加强林业科学研究工作，江西省林业科学研究所正在贯彻“积极研究、重点试验、总结经验、全面指导”的方针，充实各项试验设备，加强同有关部门的联系，广泛交流经验，更系统地研究和传播林业科学技术知识，以便有效地指导和推进全省林业建设事业的发展。
