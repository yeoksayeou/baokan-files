　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 21st: The Gaolang Agricultural Cooperative in Yangchun County, Guangdong Province, has launched a "One Person, One Plan" campaign during spring plowing and production. More than two thousand cooperative members held various professional meetings and came up with more than a thousand suggestions, large and small, for increasing production.
　　Ke Linong, the director of the Gaolang Cooperative, and other activists, after hearing the Party's call to strive for a bumper harvest this year by every possible means, organized cooperative members to launch a "One Person, One Plan" campaign. Many production teams revised their internal production increase measures based on the suggestions made by the cooperative members. For example, the Yang Jiasheng Production Team plans to build water storage channels on thirty mu of dry land. The Lai Yuan Production Team proposed that seedlings should also be planted in the nursery fields during the late rice crop. In order to solve the current financial difficulties, cooperative members came up with the idea of each person collecting two hundred jin of firewood to burn lime; all two hundred households with savings accounts in the cooperative also agreed to invest in the cooperative.

　  “一人一计”运动在高塱农业社开展
    新华社广州21日电　广东省阳春县高塱农业社，在春耕生产中开展了“一人一计”运动。二千多名社员分别召开了各种专业会议，共想出一千多条大小的增产办法。
    高塱社主任柯里浓和积极分子，听到党的千方百计力争今年大丰收的号召以后，就组织社员开展了一个“一人一计”运动。很多生产队根据社员提出的办法，重新修订了队内的增产措施。如杨家盛生产队要把三十亩旱田都修起贮水渠。赖元生产队提出晚造时要将育秧地也插上秧。为了解决眼前资金的困难，社员又想出每人打二百斤柴烧石灰；全社二百户存款户还同意向社投资。
