    A Township Head Settles Down in the Cooperative
    Dong Yuan Shi Cun
    On the way home
    Zhao Banghou is the deputy director of the Fenglu First Cooperative in Danfeng County, Shaanxi Province. Three years ago, when he was the township head of Ziyu Township, his home village established the first agricultural cooperative in the county and also in the Shangluo Special District. The cooperative was small, with only eleven households, and the county party committee also sent cadres to be stationed there permanently; however, at that time, it was indeed not easy to make this seedling grow strong. In order to erect the first banner of agricultural cooperation in the entire special district, the county and district party committees decided to let Zhao Banghou return to his home village to participate in the leadership work of this agricultural cooperative.
    Although Zhao Banghou accepted this task verbally, and he also understood it in principle, "Go ahead, it's all the same wherever you work, as long as you truly do something good for the people..." But on the day he carried his bedding back to the village, his mood was particularly bad. On the road, he hesitated about this and that, "We are not afraid of suffering when we go back; but what if the cooperative is not run well?" From the perspectives of personal future and the opinions of the villagers, he also raised a series of distressing questions to himself: "Agricultural production deals with cattle plowing and manure all day long, what future will there be in the future?" "If you don't be a township head, but go to be a cooperative cadre, will others laugh at you? Will the people in the village look up to you in the future?"... These questions bit his heart like poisonous snakes, making him anxious, upset, and his steps heavy. In the past, it would take him less than noon to travel the twenty-odd miles from his home to Ziyu Township, leaving after breakfast. But this day on his way home, it was long past sunset, and he had not yet finished the journey. When he met acquaintances on the road, he was reluctant to greet them, and when people asked him where he was going, he only said vaguely that he was "going to the district for a meeting."
    Holding hands again to move forward
    The eleven households of the Fenglu Cooperative were mainly composed of village cadres and activists. These people and Zhao Banghou had grown up together since the anti-hegemony and land reform movements. The cooperative members were especially happy to learn that Comrade Zhao Banghou had returned to participate in the cooperative. As soon as he met Zhao Banghou, Jia Hongfu, the director of the cooperative, jokingly asked, "Are you thinking of being the township head or the cooperative cadre?" Then he shook Banghou's hand and said, "Banghou, you have been a cadre for several years anyway, you are familiar with the policies, and you are literate. With you back, our cooperative will be easy to manage, and we can move forward in big strides." That night, some of his old poor friends came to see him one after another and talked with him. Chen Si, a hired farmhand and cooperative member, said excitedly when he saw Banghou: "In the past, whether it was land reform or repairing canals, we were always together. Now that you are back at this time, it's just right, and we can get to work!" After a group of young men talked with him for a while and left, a group of elderly people crowded into the room to see him. "The government wouldn't ask us to do it if the cooperative wasn't good." Old Luo Fuyou, a hired farmhand in his fifties, continued to tell Banghou what was in his heart: "It's just that people in the village can't really get used to working in the cooperative right now; you have been a cadre for several years, and you know all the policies. This time, the government asked you to come back, which is the right thing to do. In the past, we could grow grain in this dry land. I don't believe we can't grow crops well in this paddy field if we run the cooperative well! We are people who have suffered, as long as you lead the cooperative well, we will do whatever you tell us to do..."
    Banghou's heart, which had been uneasy, calmed down when he heard these words from his fellow villagers. When he and his former comrades stepped on the fields outside the village and saw the rolling water of the Longtan Canal, he felt that it was important to return to the cooperative. The villagers welcomed him back because they hoped that he, like when he led the people to repair the canal, would mobilize the cooperative members, run the cooperative well, and let everyone live a better life faster.
    Speaking of which, it has been a long time. Just after the land reform, Secretary Zhang of the county party committee once came to the village to have a discussion with everyone about how to improve production. Jia Hongfu was a stonemason who had forged millstones in Sanyuan and Jingyang. He said: In Sanyuan and Jingyang, people have built canals and rely on irrigating the land to grow crops, with high and guaranteed yields. A lot of water here flows away in vain; it would be great if we could build a canal and use it like they do. At that time, after studying the matter, the township submitted a canal construction plan to the county, and after the county sent people to survey the terrain, it was decided that three townships would jointly build a Longtan Canal. Construction started in March 1952. Jia Hongfu served as the water conservancy commissioner, and Zhao Banghou served as the township militia labor captain. From spring to winter, they split mountains and cut ridges, filled soil and built stones. The project was arduous, and there were many insurmountable difficulties in many places. Zhao Banghou led a group of young people and organized a "strengthening group" to specifically select the most difficult tasks. This canal took almost a year to build, and Banghou never left the construction site. On the day the canal was completed and water was released, Banghou was rated as an A-class model worker. At that time, Banghou was extremely excited. He believed that the lives of the local people would be greatly improved from then on. However, the 3,000 mu of land irrigated by this ten-mile-long canal were planted in small plots, and the potential for increased production was not fully realized. He thought, after leading the people to repair the canal, he became the township head due to work needs; now, why can't he come back to lead the cooperative again according to work needs?" Banghou thought about these things, and he became more confident in leading the cooperative and dispelled the idea of considering his "personal future." He wanted to move forward with everyone again. He could not leave this happy labor ranks. He wanted to fulfill the hopes of the villagers, and like when he led the repair of the canal, roll up his sleeves and trouser legs and work hard.
    Together with cooperative members
    Not long after Banghou returned to the cooperative, he discovered that the main problem with the cooperative's poor management was that the cooperative cadres were not united, and neither the cooperative members nor the cooperative cadres had the habit of discussing and solving problems when encountering them. They would shout and quarrel at the slightest pretext, affecting the cooperative members' production morale. Yao Xiaolian, the cadre stationed in the cooperative, knew about these situations; but because he did not yet grasp the personality of each individual, he could not solve this problem. Banghou used the gaps in production and meal breaks to visit and chat with people, understanding people's thoughts from house to house; searching for the root causes of these problems in the cooperative and solutions.
    Banghou's brother, Kuanhou, was the deputy director of the cooperative at that time. Kuanhou was an enthusiastic person, but he had a bad temper and would quarrel with people at the slightest pretext. Because of this, his elderly mother was often on tenterhooks. The night Banghou returned, she felt even more heavy-hearted. She told Banghou, "Every time I hear someone quarreling, I think it's your brother, and you're back again, what are we going to do?" Banghou comforted his mother, "The Party let me come back in order to help everyone unite and run the cooperative well. As long as everyone is united, what are you afraid of?" For several nights, Banghou first had sincere talks with his brother. The two brothers talked until midnight. His brother realized the disadvantages that relying solely on enthusiasm and not paying attention to methods would bring to the cooperative, and he resolutely changed his bad temper.
    Jia Hongfu, the director of the cooperative, was steady in his work but not good at discussing matters with everyone. The cooperative members had even more complaints about him. Banghou helped Hongfu analyze the cooperative's problems, making Hongfu realize the importance of running the cooperative democratically and learning the ability to consult with each other on matters.
    In this way, from house to house, they persuaded the cooperative cadres and members to be convinced. Everyone knew their own shortcomings and also knew the advantages of others. After several self-criticism meetings were held, the problem of disunity was resolved.
    At that time, there was another big problem in the cooperative: the method of scoring work points was unreasonable. Work points were recorded solely based on the amount of time spent working, regardless of the strength of the labor. In order to solve this problem, he read about foreign experiences and found a contracting method used by a cooperative in Northeast China. Although he tried his best to publicize it and let everyone consider adopting it, everyone was unfamiliar with it and unwilling to implement it. Finally, he first led the youth Zhao Zongzheng, Jia Zhifa, Chen Si, and others to study and contract for pulling out a field of cotton stalks. Then, they tested the contract for carrying manure. Originally, when sending manure to the Mayingchi field, each laborer would start and stop together, and each person could only carry eighteen loads per day. After the contract was implemented and work points were recorded based on the amount and quality of work, strong laborers could carry up to twenty-one loads. With quotas set, everyone no longer needed to argue about who had more or less work points when recording them. From that time on, they began to implement contracts, gradually solving the phenomenon of chaotic production.
    Since Banghou returned to the cooperative, he has been directly participating in production. Last year, this cooperative was transformed into an advanced cooperative, and the number of households increased. His work became even more numerous, and he worked more than sixty labor days. Banghou was also very concerned about the lives of each cooperative member. Last year, during the Spring Festival, he found that Zhao Anwa's and Yang Faxing's families had no firewood to burn. The cooperative was far from the mountains, and it was almost New Year's Eve, so it was not appropriate to mobilize the cooperative members to go to the mountains to chop firewood again. He completely lent these two families the eight yuan he had saved for the festival to buy firewood.
    In this way, these old comrades, who had originally participated in the democratic reform movement, joined hands again and moved forward towards socialism. Under Banghou's influence, the phenomena of disunity among cooperative cadres and chaotic production were quickly overcome. Some people in the village, who originally thought that agricultural cooperatives would be ruined by squabbling, also changed their views. Coupled with the fact that increased production within the cooperative attracted people, the cooperative expanded year by year—twenty-eight households, one hundred and one households, four hundred and ten households, and now it has reached four hundred and forty households. As for output, in terms of the average per-mu yield of grain fields, it was 256 jin when working individually, 343 jin in mutual aid teams, 367 jin in elementary cooperatives, and by 1956, when advanced cooperatives were established, it had approached 400 jin.
    The banner has been erected, and the Fenglu Cooperative has become a good cooperative of the first category in the county. The county often asks the cadres of this cooperative to introduce their experiences in management and production measures. The cooperative members are now even more satisfied with Banghou's return to lead the cooperative. They say that since the birth of the Fenglu Cooperative, it has never been separated from the nanny (referring to the cadres stationed in the cooperative), but problems still abound; since Banghou returned, he is familiar with the situation, has a good work style, and works wholeheartedly with all the cooperative cadres, this cooperative will soon be able to leave the nanny.

    一个在社里落户的乡长
    东园  石村
    在回家的路上
    赵榜厚是陕西省丹凤县凤麓一社的副主任。三年前，当他在资峪乡担任乡长的时候，他家乡的村上办起了全县也是全商雒专区的第一个农业社。社不大，只有十一户，县委还派有干部常驻；但是，在当时，要让这个嫩芽茁壮地成长，确实是不容易的。县区党委为了把全专区农业合作化的第一面旗子竖立起来，决定让赵榜厚回家到这个农业社参加领导工作。
    对于这个任务，赵榜厚虽然嘴上也接受了，在道理上他也想的通，“去吧，到哪里还不是工作，只要给人民真正做点好事，……”可是，当他背起铺盖卷回村的那一天，他的情绪却特别坏起来。在路上，他犹豫这犹豫那，“回去受苦咱不怕；要是社办不好，怎么办？”从个人和前途和乡邻的看法上，也给自己提出了一连串苦恼的问题：“农业生产整天与牛犁粪土打交道，将来会有啥出息？”“不当乡长，去当社干部，别人会不会笑话？这以后村里的人能看得起自己吗？”……这些问题像毒蛇咬着心一样，使他焦急、烦闷，脚步沉重。他往常从家到资峪乡那二十多里路，吃过早饭动身，不到中午就到了。可是这天回家，日偏西多时了，还没走完这段路程。路上碰到熟人，他也不愿打招呼，有的人问他到哪里去，他只含含糊糊说“上区开会”。
    重新携起手来前进
    十一户的凤麓社，主要是由村干部和积极分子组成的。这些人和赵榜厚都是从反霸和土地改革运动中一道成长起来的。社员知道赵榜厚同志这次回家是来参加社的，都特别高兴。社主任贾宏福一见面先打趣地问：“当乡长呀还是当社干部，思想通得过吗？”接着握着榜厚的手说：“榜厚，好坏你当了几年干部了，政策熟悉，又认字，你一回来呀，咱社里就好办了，咱就能大步前进了。”那天晚上，和他过去要好的一些穷朋友，一个个都来看他，和他谈心。雇农社员陈四来见了榜厚，激动地说：“以往咱们不管土改、修渠，都是同来同去，现在你在这个时候，又回来了，正来的好，这下咱就能干起来了！”一个个青年小伙子和他谈了一阵走了，紧接着来看他的老年人又挤了一屋。“社不好，政府也不会叫咱们办。”近五十岁的雇农罗福有老汉给榜厚继续说着他心里的话：“就是社里眼前做活，咱庄稼人实在看不惯；你当了几年干部了，啥政策你都了解，这次政府叫你回来，做的对。过去咱这旱地都能打粮食，把社办的好好的，我不信咱这水地做不好庄稼！咱可是受苦的人，你们只要把社领导好，你们叫我怎办，我就怎办……”
    榜厚听到了乡亲们的这些话，使他那不安静的心情平静下来了。当他和过去的那些伙伴一道踏上村外的田地，看见龙潭渠的滚滚流水的时候，他感到回到社里重要了。乡亲们欢迎他回来，就是希望他和以前领导民工修渠一样，把社员发动起来，把社办好，让大家更快地把日子过好。
    提起来，时间很久了。刚土地改革以后，县委张书记有一次到村上来和大家座谈怎样提高生产。贾宏福是个石匠，曾在三原、泾阳一带锻过磨子。他说：三原、泾阳一带，人家修了水渠，靠浇地种田，产量又高又保险。这里有很多水白白地流走了；如果也像人家一样，修起渠利用起来就好了。当时乡上研究以后，就提出了一个修渠计划送到县上，县上派人勘察地形以后，确定三个乡合修一个龙潭渠。1952年3月动工。贾宏福担任水利委员，赵榜厚担任了乡民工大队长。从春到冬，劈山削岭，填土打石，工程艰巨，有很多地方都有难以克服的困难。赵榜厚领导一群青年人，组织了一支“加强组”，专门挑选最困难的任务。这条渠几乎修了一年，榜厚始终没离开过工地，渠成放水的那天，榜厚被评为甲等模范。那时候，榜厚心里兴奋极了。认为从此以后当地人民生活会大大改善。可是，这十里长渠浇灌的三千亩土地，被割成小块种植着，增产潜力并没有充分发挥出来。他想，在领导民工修渠以后，由于工作需要，自己当了乡长；现在为什么就不能按工作需要再回来领导办社呢？”榜厚想到了这些事，他更增添了领导办社的信心，也打消了考虑“个人前途”的念头。他要和大家再一起前进，他不能离开这愉快的劳动行列，他要满足村上人的希望，和领导修渠那阵一样，挽起袖筒、裤腿来，努力干下去。
    同社员在一起
    榜厚回到社里不久，就发现社没办好的主要问题是：社干部不够团结，社员社干部都没有遇事商量解决的习惯，动不动就是大声嚷吵，影响社员的生产情绪。驻社干部姚孝廉对这些情况都了解；可是因为对每个人的性格还掌握不住，对这个问题怎也解决不好。榜厚就利用生产空隙和吃饭休息时间串门谈心，一家一家了解人们的心思；找寻社内发生这些问题的根源和解决的办法。
    榜厚的哥哥宽厚那时候是社里的副主任。宽厚是个积极热情的人，就是脾气不好，动不动就和人嚷吵。为这事，年迈的母亲经常捏着一把汗。榜厚回来那夜，她就心事更沉重了。她告诉榜厚：“一听见有人吵嚷，我就当是你哥，你又回来了，这怎么得了？”榜厚给母亲宽慰说：“党让我回来，就是为了叫我帮助大家团结一心办好社。只要大家团结了，你还愁怕什么呢？”几个晚上，榜厚就先和哥哥进行恳切谈话，弟兄两个一谈谈到半夜，他哥认识到了光凭热情、不讲方式方法给社带来的坏处，坚决改掉自己的坏脾气。
    社主任贾宏福做事稳健，却不善于同大家商量办事，社员对他意见更大，榜厚就帮助宏福分析社的问题，使宏福认识民主办社的重要，学会互相协商办事的本领。
    这样，一家一家，说的社干部和社员都心服口服，各人知道自己有缺点，也知道别人有优点；开了几次检讨会议，就解决了不团结的问题。
    当时，社里还有一个大问题：评分记工办法不合理。记工不分劳力强弱，一律按做活时间记工分。为了解决这个问题，他翻阅了外地经验，找到了东北一个社包工的办法。当时他虽然尽力宣传，让大家酝酿采用，可是大家不摸底，不愿意实行。最后，他就先领导青年赵宗正、贾志发、陈四来等研究，包拔了一块棉花杆。接着，又试验了担粪的包工。原来向马营池地里送粪，每个劳力齐起齐落，每人每天只能送十八担。试行包工按做活多少好坏记分以后，强的劳力可送到二十一担。有了定额，大家在记工的时候也用不着为你多我少去争吵了。从这时候起，他们就开始实行包工，逐步解决了生产混乱的现象。
    榜厚回到社里以后，一直是直接参加生产的。去年这个社转成高级社，户数多了，他的工作更多了，还做了六十多个劳动日。榜厚对每家社员的生活也十分关心。去年过春节，他发现赵安娃、杨发兴两家没柴烧，社里离山远，又快到除夕，再动员社员上山砍柴也不合适，他就把他腰里留下过节的八元钱，完全借给这两家买了柴。
    就这样，这些原来在民主改革运动中的老伙伴们，又共同携起手来，向社会主义前进了。在榜厚的影响下，社干部不团结、生产混乱现象很快克服了。村上原来一些认为农业社七嘴八舌会吵烂的人，也改变了看法。加上社内增产的事实吸引着人们，社一年一年扩大了——二十八户，一百零一户，四百一十户，现在达到了四百四十户。产量呢，按粮田平均亩产量说，单干时候二百五十六斤，互助组时候三百四十三斤，初级社时候三百六十七斤，到1956年办高级社的时候，已接近四百斤了。
    旗帜树立起来了，凤麓社成为全县第一类的好社。县上经常让这个社的干部介绍经营管理、生产措施等方面的经验。社员们现在对榜厚回家领导社更感到满意了。他们说，凤麓社生下来以后，从没离开过奶妈（指驻社干部），可是问题还是一大堆；自从榜厚回来以后，他熟悉情况，作风好，和全体社干部一心干，这个社很快就能离开奶妈了。
