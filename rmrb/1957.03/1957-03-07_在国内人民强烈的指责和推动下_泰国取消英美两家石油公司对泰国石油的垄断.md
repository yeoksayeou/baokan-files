    Under the strong condemnation and promotion of the domestic people
    Thailand canceled the monopoly of British and American oil companies on Thai oil
    Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, 6th: According to Thai newspapers, the Thai government signed a new contract with the British "Shell Oil Company" and the American "Mobil Oil Company" on February 26, canceling the monopoly of these two foreign oil companies on Thai oil trade and amending some unequal clauses in the old contract.
    According to the new contract, the Thai government's oil and fuel agency will now have the right to freely trade with the public; the land rent that Thailand leases to these two oil companies will increase from the past one baht per square wah (approximately eighty inches per wah) to twelve baht. At the same time, the land lease term will be reduced by fifteen years compared to the provisions in the old contract. After the lease term expires, the two oil companies can only renew the lease for another twelve years, while the Thai authorities have the right to take back the unused leased land of the two oil companies after the contract comes into effect.
    The old contract between the Thai government and these two oil companies was signed in April 1947. This contract stipulated that the Thai authorities' oil and fuel agency could only trade with government units and other official organizations. However, British and American oil companies have made huge profits by taking advantage of their monopoly on oil trade with the Thai public and the low cost of oil extraction and refining in Thailand.
    Due to the increasingly strong condemnation by the Thai people and politicians of the unequal nature of this old contract, the Thai authorities have held negotiations with these two British and American oil companies to amend the contract since August last year.

    在国内人民强烈的指责和推动下
    泰国取消英美两家石油公司对泰国石油的垄断
    据新华社6日讯　曼谷消息：据泰国报纸报道，泰国政府同英国“壳牌石油公司”和美国“美孚油公司”在2月26日签订了一项新的合同，取消了这两家外国石油公司对泰国石油贸易的垄断，并且修改了旧合同中的一些不平等的条文。
    根据这项新合同，泰国政府的石油燃料机构今后有权自由同公众进行贸易；泰国出租给这两家石油公司的土地租金将由过去每平方哇
  （每哇约合八十吋）泰币一铢增加到十二铢。同时，土地租期将比旧合同中的规定减少十五年，租期届满后，两家石油公司只能再续租十二年，而泰国当局在合同生效后就有权收回两家石油公司没有动用的租地。
    泰国政府同这两家石油公司之间的旧合同是在1947年4月签订的。这项合同规定，泰国当局的石油燃料机构只能同政府单位和其他官方组织进行贸易。而英美的石油公司却利用对泰国公众的石油贸易的垄断地位和在泰国采炼石油的低廉成本获得了巨大利润。
    由于泰国人民和政界人士日益强烈指责这项旧合同的不平等性质，泰国当局从去年8月起同这两家英美石油公司举行了修改合同的谈判。
