    "Amateur Office Hours"
    Jing Gao
    The "Amateur Office" of the Dahua Textile Factory has begun operations. Following a pre-arranged division of labor, one person staffs the office to receive workers, while the other two go into the male and female worker dormitories to conduct rounds and solicit opinions from the workers. As the office staff reached the entrance of the female worker dormitory management office, a female worker rushed over from a distance. As she walked, she asked, "Are you the amateur office staff? I have an opinion to raise." She hurried into the female worker dormitory management office and began to speak before the staff could even open their mouths: "This just happened. Someone called us, but the male worker dormitory staff wouldn't pass on the message (the female dormitory doesn't have a phone and is far from the male dormitory), and they even acted rudely. Please tell him to be more careful…" In a moment, more than a dozen female workers arrived, mostly young women, crowding the female dormitory management office, gathering around the stove to tell the amateur office staff their opinions and requests.
    What exactly is "amateur office hours"? This is one of the concrete measures adopted by the Communist Party of China's Xi'an Public-Private Joint Dahua Textile Factory Committee to improve leadership style and strengthen ties with the masses. Under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, 66 people, including heads of the factory's Party Committee, Trade Union, Communist Youth League, and workshop-level leaders, were organized into groups (generally three people per group, with one person serving as the group leader). They were scheduled to take turns holding office hours during their spare time (6:30 PM to 8:30 PM) on Mondays and Fridays, going into the worker dormitories to understand the workers' and their families' living and thinking conditions, and to gather opinions on all aspects. They would promptly help resolve issues that could be addressed immediately; for those that couldn't be handled, they would report to the Party Committee that night, which would then forward them to relevant departments for research and resolution.
    Holding office hours in spare time is indeed a good way to strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses. In the past, workers were producing and cadres were working, and when workers rested, cadres were off duty, so there were few opportunities to understand the workers' situation. Now, the leadership can quickly learn about problems that arise among the workers, whether in production or in life.
    The Party Committee attaches great importance to studying and resolving the opinions reflected by the workers. In addition to conducting a monthly review of the work of the amateur office and promptly forwarding the opinions reflected by the workers to the relevant departments for handling, it also earnestly holds meetings to study and resolve all issues that fall within the scope of the Party Committee's work or are more significant. For example, after Pi Gun workers Zhao Pijie and technician Cai Yusheng returned from attending the National Textile Industry Advanced Producer Representative Conference, they introduced the experience of a factory in Qingdao in "changing Pi Guns with medium-count yarn," and later they suggested that the factory leadership conduct trials and promote it within the factory; however, no response was seen until the end of last year. After the amateur office hours began, young worker Wang Ziting raised this suggestion again. After being forwarded by the Party Committee to the administrative department, the factory leadership promptly conducted research and made arrangements to promote this experience.
    The Party Committee also handles the opinions and problems raised by workers in their lives and studies with the same caring attitude. During the amateur office hours, more than 30 opinions criticized the poor attitude of the canteen service staff, cold food, unreasonable prices, and reluctance to give change. Based on these opinions, the Party Committee immediately organized an inspection team led by a member of the Party Committee to conduct a special inspection of the canteen work. Now, stronger cadres have been sent to strengthen the management of the canteen, establish cost accounting and a correct inventory system, and adjust food prices, which has improved the canteen work and the workers have responded well. The workers felt that the workers' spare-time school assigned too much homework, which the workers couldn't finish; in addition, the spare-time school was far from the workshop, and after getting off work, there were only 20 minutes, and after handing over the early shift (the factory has three shifts), it was hard to get to class even if they ran. Many workers were criticized from three sides: if they didn't complete their production tasks, the leaders would criticize them, if they didn't finish their homework, the teachers would criticize them, and if they did homework at home, their wives would criticize them. This affected the workers' learning enthusiasm and production enthusiasm. The Party Committee also studied this issue and immediately notified the spare-time cultural school to delay the class time by ten minutes and reduce the learning tasks, and some homework could be done in class. This solved the workers' difficulties. The amateur office group also patiently explained the suggestions and requests made by the workers that were temporarily difficult to resolve. This not only strengthened the relationship between the leaders and the workers, but also enhanced the workers' confidence in overcoming difficulties. For example, the workers in the winding workshop suggested that the lighting in the workshop was poor. The "office staff" immediately explained that the factory was an old factory, and the equipment in all aspects was relatively poor, and the lighting was the same. To reach the standard of a new factory, it would still take a certain period of effort. After understanding the actual situation, the workers expressed that they would overcome the temporary difficulties.
    Everyone in the factory is very satisfied with the implementation of amateur office hours, especially the workers are very moved. They said: The Party Committee works the same hours as us, and even goes deep into the masses in their spare time to help solve problems. We should work harder in production. Many workers have shown even greater enthusiasm. Jia Quanlin, a worker in the Pi Gun room, made a suggestion in the second quarter of last year to "improve the operation method of the leather belt," but the leadership did not support it; after it was adopted by the relevant department through the amateur office this time, the operation was changed from two people to one person, reducing the labor force; so he became more active, and now he is further studying to improve this operation method. The leaders who participated in the amateur office hours generally felt that it was a great education and inspiration for them, and provided conditions for improving their work in the future. Tian Changsi, the head of the Planning Section, said: "Being one with the workers is a prerequisite for doing a good job; although I went to the workshop in the past, it was not as in-depth as this time."

    “业余办公”
    景高
    大华纺织厂“业余办公室”开始办公了。值班人员按预先商量好的分工，一个人在办公室里接待工人；另外两个人深入男工、女工宿舍，巡回访问和征求工人们的意见。当办公人员刚走到女工房管理处门口的时候，一个女工由远处奔来，她边走边问：“你们是业余办公的吗？我有意见要提。”她紧走慢跑地进入女工房管理处，没等值班人员开口就说开了：“这是刚才的事，有人给我们打来电话，男工房的值班人不给传人（女工房没有电话，距男工房又较远），还耍态度，请你们转告他注意改正……”片刻，陆续来了十几个女工，多半是年轻的姑娘，挤满了女工房管理处，围着火炉在向业余办公人员讲述她们的意见和要求。
    “业余办公”是怎么回事呢？这原是中共西安市公私合营大华纺织厂委员会改进领导作风、密切联系群众所采用的具体办法之一。在党委的统一领导下，组织了全厂党委、工会、青年团的负责人以及车间主任级的领导人员等六十六人，预先编好小组（一般的每组都是三人，有一人担任小组长），排好值班次序，每逢星期一、五的业余时间（下午六时半到八时半）轮流值班，深入职工宿舍，了解工人及家属的生活、思想情况和对各方面的意见。做到能够处理的就及时帮助解决；处理不了的，当晚汇报给党委，由党委批转有关部门研究解决。
    业余时间办公，的确是一个加强党和群众联系的好办法。过去工人生产、干部上班，工人休息、干部下班，很少有机会了解工人的情况；现在，工人中发生的问题，不论是生产上的或是生活上的，领导方面都能很快的知道。
    党委对工人反映的意见，都很重视研究和解决。除每月对业余办公室的工作进行一次检查，把工人所反映的意见及时批转各有关部门处理外，凡属于党委工作范围内或较为重大的问题，都能认真开会研究解决。如皮辊工人赵丕杰和技术员蔡玉生出席全国纺织业先进生产者代表会议回来，介绍了青岛某厂“中纱换皮辊”的经验，后来他们又建议厂的领导在厂内试验推广；但至去年年底，未见答复。业余办公开始后，青年工人王子亭又提出了这个建议。经党委批转行政部门之后，厂领导方面及时作了研究安排，推广这个经验。
    工人们在生活、学习方面提出的意见和问题，党委也以同样关心的态度去处理。在业余办公时间内，有三十多条意见批评了食堂的服务人员态度不好、菜冷、菜价不合理，怕找零头等。党委根据这些意见，即组织了一个由党委委员领导的检查小组，对食堂工作专门进行了检查；现在，已经派了较强的干部，加强了食堂的管理工作，建立了成本核算和正确的盘存制度，并调整了菜价，使食堂工作得到了改进，工人反映很好。职工业余学校给工人布置作业过多，工人作不完；加上业余学校离车间较远，下了班只有二十分钟的时间，早班交班（厂里分三班生产）以后，紧跑快跑都赶不上上课，工人有意见。好些工人受到三方面的批评，生产任务完不成领导方面要批评，作业作不完老师要批评，在家里赶作业老婆要批评。这就影响了工人的学习情绪和生产积极性。对于这个问题，党委也作了研究，随即通知业余文化学校把上课时间向后延迟十分钟，把学习任务减轻，有些作业可以放在课堂上去做。解决了工人的困难。业余办公小组对工人提出的暂时难以解决的建议和要求，也都能耐心地向工人作了解释。这样，既使领导和工人的关系更加密切，又增强了工人克服困难的信心。如摇纱车间的工人提出车间光线不好。“办公人员”即作了解释，说明本厂是个老厂子，各方面设备都较差些，照明也一样，要达到新建厂子的标准，还要经过一定时期的努力。工人了解了实际情况以后，表示要克服暂时的困难。
    在厂内实行业余办公，人人都很满意，特别是工人很受感动。他们说：党委同我们一样上班，业余时间还深入群众，帮助解决问题，我们更应当努力生产。好多工人发挥了更大的积极性。皮辊房工人贾全林，去年第二季度曾提出“改进皮带操作方法”的建议，领导方面不支持；这次经业余办公室转有关部门采纳以后，由原来二人操作改为一人操作，减少了劳动力；于是他更加积极了，现在他又进一步研究改进这一操作方法。参加业余办公的领导人员，普遍感到对自己的教育启发很大，给今后改进工作提供了条件。计划科长田长泗说：“和工人打成一片，是做好工作的先决条件；我过去虽然也下车间，但没有这次深入。”
