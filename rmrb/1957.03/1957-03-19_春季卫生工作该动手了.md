Spring has arrived, and mass sanitation work urgently needs to be strengthened.

In 1956, all parts of the country carried out a large-scale patriotic sanitation campaign centered on eliminating diseases and eradicating the "Four Pests," with great success. Many areas became rat-free zones, reducing or eliminating rat infestations. In some rural areas, small and medium-sized towns, and some large cities, mosquitoes and flies have been reduced compared to the past. Various localities have also done a lot of work in cleaning houses and neighborhoods, repairing roads, improving toilets and the rational disposal of feces and garbage, filling in pits and depressions, dredging ditches, separating humans and livestock, and cleaning up livestock management. Due to improved environmental sanitation conditions and the large-scale elimination of disease-spreading vectors, the incidence of certain diseases transmitted by mosquitoes and flies has gradually decreased. In 1956, the national incidence of infectious diseases decreased by an average of 50% compared to 1955. For example, in Wuhan, the incidence of dysentery in 1956 decreased by 61% compared to the same period in 1955, and the incidence of encephalitis decreased by 62%. Other provinces and cities, such as Nanjing, Tianjin, and Shaanxi, also experienced varying degrees of reduction in the incidence of various infectious diseases.

However, the sanitation work in many large and medium-sized cities and counties last year was not done well enough. The environmental sanitation conditions in some cities have even deteriorated compared to the past. The sanitation departments in these areas still lack a clear understanding of the purpose of the patriotic sanitation movement, lack comprehensive planning and specific goals for the patriotic sanitation movement, and have not conducted in-depth health education and enlightenment work, as well as personal hygiene education to cultivate people's hygiene habits. In terms of the mode of operation, they only paid attention to launching vigorous campaigns, without effectively consolidating the gains and maintaining them on a regular basis. Technical guidance was also insufficient.

The main task of this year's sanitation work is still to fight against diseases that seriously endanger people's health. All localities should continue to carry out mass patriotic sanitation campaigns, further improve the sanitary conditions of people's living environment, eliminate the breeding conditions for disease-spreading vectors, and cultivate good public and personal hygiene habits. This requires sanitation departments in all localities to strengthen their leadership over the patriotic sanitation movement. Health departments should actively lead several concentrated campaigns a year, comprehensively and thoroughly mobilize the masses, and focus on solving some major environmental sanitation improvement matters that cannot be solved by a few people under normal circumstances. It is also important to educate the masses through concentrated campaigns and, on the basis of the continuous improvement of the masses' awareness and active actions, actively lead the rectification and establishment of grass-roots mass health organizations. In order to maintain the regularity and gradual improvement of sanitation work, all localities should also mobilize the masses to formulate sanitation covenants and sanitation systems that meet the needs of the masses and are acceptable to them, and advocate the establishment of mass sanitation inspection and supervision, in order to eliminate as soon as possible the diseases that pose the greatest threat to people's health and rapidly reduce the incidence of diseases.

Carrying out mass sanitation campaigns is a meticulous and regular task. According to past experience, the effects of holding only two or three concentrated sanitation campaigns in a year's several seasons are still limited. It is necessary to formulate comprehensive plans based on the prevalence of diseases in various regions and the characteristics of climate and geography, in accordance with the people's production and living habits, and to propose specific contents and requirements for sanitation actions in each season, so that the masses can develop good hygiene habits through numerous sanitation campaigns. Therefore, all regions are required to overcome the shortcomings of being vigorous during past concentrated campaigns but deserted afterwards, as well as the tendency to not understand the situation and make excessive demands.

In order to continuously improve the quality of sanitation campaigns and enhance and consolidate the enthusiasm of the masses, health departments and scientific research, agriculture, water conservancy, and other relevant departments must also provide the masses with timely scientific and technical guidance, combine it with the vital interests of the masses, as well as production and living conditions, and constantly put forward new measures and requirements, so that science and technology can serve production, serve the people's health, and combine scientific knowledge with mass movements, spending less money, doing more things, and doing great things. Health activists, model units, and model individuals who emerge in the movement should be promptly commended or rewarded. The experience of the movement should be promptly summarized and promoted.

Since the patriotic sanitation movement is an important task to eliminate diseases, promote people's health, and ensure the completion of socialist economic construction, it must implement the policy of prevention first, serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, uniting Chinese and Western medicine, and combining sanitation work with mass movements. Leaders of party organizations, governments, and basic-level production organizations at all levels must include this work in their daily work agenda, strengthen specific leadership over this work, make overall arrangements, assign special personnel to be responsible for it, and conduct regular inspections and supervision to solve difficulties and problems. This is an important guarantee for doing a good job in people's health care.

Now is the time for spring plowing and fertilizer accumulation in rural areas, and it is also the season when mosquitoes, flies, rats, and other pests begin to become active and breed. According to the past experience of "hitting early, hitting small, and hitting hard" in eliminating harmful animals and insects, getting started early will achieve twice the result with half the effort. Therefore, in conjunction with agricultural production, conducting indoor and outdoor, village and outside, street, and livestock pen cleanups in the vast rural areas and cities, dredging ditches, filling in pits and depressions, and eliminating mosquito and fly breeding places, and launching a comprehensive sanitation blitz in the spring will lay a good foundation for the year's sanitation work.

### 春季卫生工作该动手了

    春季卫生工作该动手了
    春季到来，群众卫生工作急需加强。
    1956年全国各地以消灭疾病和除四害为中心内容，开展了大规模的爱国卫生运动，收效很大。许多地区出现了无鼠区，减轻或者消除了鼠害。部分农村、中小城镇和一些大城市蚊蝇都较过去有所减少，各地在清扫居屋街坊，修整道路路面，改良厕所和粪便垃圾的合理处置，填垫坑洼，疏通沟渠，人畜分屋和对家畜的清洁管理等方面也做了许多工作。由于改善了环境卫生条件和大量消灭了病菌传播媒介，由蚊、蝇传播的某些疾病的发病率已逐渐降低。1956年全国传染病的发病率平均比1955年减少50％。如武汉市1956年的痢疾发病率比1955年同时期降低了61％，脑炎发病率降低了62％。其他如南京、天津、陕西等省市各种传染病的发病率也有不同程度的降低。
    但是，去年也有不少大、中城市和县区的卫生工作做得不够好。有的城市的环境卫生状况反而不如从前。这些地区的卫生部门对于爱国卫生运动的目的仍缺乏明确的认识，对爱国卫生运动缺乏全面规划和具体奋斗目标，没有深入进行卫生宣传教育和启蒙工作，以及培养人民的卫生习惯的个人卫生教育。在运动方式上只注意了搞轰轰烈烈的突击，没有很好巩固既得成绩和使之保持经常化。技术指导也做得不够。
    今年卫生工作的主要任务仍是向严重危害人民健康的疾病作斗争。各地应当继续开展群众性的爱国卫生运动，进一步改善人民居住环境的卫生条件，铲除疾病传播媒介的孳生条件，养成良好的公共卫生和个人卫生习惯。这就要求各地卫生部门加强对爱国卫生运动的领导。卫生部门要积极领导一年数次的突击活动，全面地、深入地发动群众，重点地解决一些平时少数人力所不能解决的巨大环境卫生改良的事宜；还要通过突击性的运动教育群众，并在群众觉悟不断提高和积极行动的基础上，积极领导整顿和建立群众的基层卫生组织。为了使卫生工作保持经常和逐步提高，各地还应当发动群众制定出适合群众需要并为群众所能接受的卫生公约、卫生制度，和提倡建立群众性的卫生检查和卫生监督，以求提前消灭危害人民健康最大的疾病和迅速降低发病率。
    开展群众性的卫生运动，是一件细致的经常性的工作。根据以往的经验，仅仅在一年的几个季节里举行二三次突击性的卫生运动，所收的效果仍然是有限的。必须根据各个地区疾病流行的情况和气候、地理的特点，按照人民生产与生活的习惯，制定出全面规划，并且根据不同的季节，提出各个季节卫生行动的具体内容和要求，使群众通过无数次的卫生运动，养成良好的卫生习惯。因此，要求各个地区克服已往突击运动时轰轰烈烈，运动后冷冷清清的缺点，以及不了解情况，要求过高等偏向。
    为了不断地提高卫生运动的质量，提高和巩固群众的积极性，卫生部门和科学研究、农业、水利、及其他有关部门，还必须及时地给予群众以科学技术指导，结合群众切身利益，以及生产与生活条件，不断提出新的措施和要求，使科学技术为生产、为人民健康服务，科学知识与群众运动相结合，少花钱，多办事，办大事。对运动中涌现出的卫生积极分子、模范单位、模范人物，应当及时给予表扬或奖励。运动中的经验，应当及时加以总结和推广。
    由于爱国卫生运动是消灭疾病，增进人民健康，保证完成社会主义经济建设的一项重要工作，它必须贯彻以预防为主，面向工农兵，团结中西医，卫生工作与群众运动相结合的方针。各级党组织、政府、生产基层组织的负责人，必须把这一工作纳入日常工作日程，加强对这一工作的具体领导，通盘安排，专人负责，定期检查和督促，解决困难问题。这是做好人民保健事业的重要保证。
    现在正是农村春耕生产积肥时期，同时也是蚊、蝇、鼠和其他害虫开始活动和繁殖的季节，根据以往除害兽、害虫要做到“打早、打小、打了”的经验，及早动手，将会收到事半功倍的效果。因此，结合农业生产，在广大农村和城市中，进行室内外、村内外、街道、牲畜栏圈的清扫，疏通沟渠，填平坑洼，铲除蚊、蝇孳生场所，在春季开展一次全面的卫生突击运动，将给全年的卫生工作打下良好的基础。
