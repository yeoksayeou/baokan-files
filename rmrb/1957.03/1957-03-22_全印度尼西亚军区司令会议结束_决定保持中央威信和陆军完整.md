Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 21st. Lieutenant Colonel Piengaadi, an army spokesman, released a communique today regarding the All-Indonesia Military Region Commanders' Conference. The conference concluded last night. The communique stated that the commanders fully recognized that the most important thing at present is to maintain the integrity of the central authority. To this end, the armed forces, especially the army, must be made more complete. At the same time, the desires expressed by various social groups for Sukarno and Hatta to jointly participate in resolving the current problems must be realized.

The conference decided that central and local military authorities will intensify efforts to eliminate corruption, smuggling, subversion, and other activities.

Regarding the implementation of the martial law order issued by the President, the conference decided to establish the position of Military Governor, implement broad autonomy within the unified republic, and carry out local construction fairly and reasonably.

Transitional local councils will continue to work, with working methods arranged by local military authorities.

The communique stated that the Army Chief of Staff will convene a meeting of regimental commanders of infantry regiments and provincial governors or local leaders governing a statutory province.

Regarding improving the internal organization of the army, the conference decided: The First Military Region (in North and Central Sumatra, according to the old jurisdiction) will accelerate the implementation of the decisions of the Jambi Military Conference on January 29.

The Second Military Region (South Sumatra) has already arranged methods for resolving the governor's issue and has clarified the proper procedures for implementing martial law. Civil administrations (the governor and transitional local councils) will work as usual, but working methods will be arranged by the military authorities.

For the Sixth Military Region (Kalimantan), Lieutenant Colonel Utomo will serve as the commander of the Sixth Military Region until the President and Supreme Commander makes a decision. Colonel Abimanyu, the original commander of the Sixth Military Region, will be transferred to the central government to assist the Army Chief of Staff.

Regarding the actions of the commander of the Seventh Military Region (Eastern Indonesia) on March 2nd in announcing the establishment of a military government, the army leadership can understand its purpose, but in terms of discipline, cannot recognize this method of announcement as legitimate.

Regarding the pacification command in Southwest and Southeast Sulawesi, and the military issues within Sulawesi, some decisions have been made and will be implemented rapidly.

Regarding the issue of the Central Sumatra Military District Command, the conference decided to accelerate the return of the local government to the proper national system under the circumstances of the implementation of martial law. As for the implementation methods, it is still necessary to consult with the Central Sumatra military authorities.
