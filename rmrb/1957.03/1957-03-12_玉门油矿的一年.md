Yumen Oil Mine's Year
Yang Zhengmin's Speech

Last year was the year of the greatest development and change for the Yumen Oil Mine. The oil mine workers displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm and adopted the latest technologies, thus achieving great results. This year, the Yumen Oil Mine will be responsible for half of China's crude oil production.

I wholeheartedly endorse Chairman Mao's instructions at the Supreme State Conference and fully agree with Premier Zhou's report and other reports. Now, I will only make the following statement regarding some of the situations and problems in the Yumen Oil Mine's work last year:

1956 was the year of the fastest development and greatest change for the Yumen Oil Mine; it was also the most intense year for all our workers to accelerate the construction of the motherland's first natural petroleum base. This year, driven by the upsurge of the socialist revolution across the country and inspired by the resolutions of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, the enthusiasm of all mine workers for building socialism was higher than ever before. Judging from our implementation of the tasks assigned by the state in 1956, not only is the situation good, but the achievements are also significant.

In terms of geological exploration, tens of thousands of geological exploration personnel fought arduously against the severe cold, wind, and sand in the Qilian Mountains and the Gobi Desert. The workload of geological surveys completed 113% of the state plan; the workload of geophysical work completed 148%; a total of more than 228,000 meters of wells were drilled throughout the year, equivalent to the total footage from 1949 to 1955; by January of this year, the drilling targets had been completed ahead of schedule for the First Five-Year Plan. The advanced 3203 drilling team also created a new national record of drilling more than 10,000 meters annually, with an average drilling rig monthly speed of 1,095 meters, approaching the level of the general advanced drilling teams in the Soviet Union. Our drilling workers not only learned to drill directional wells and use turbine drills, but also mastered deep well drilling technology and completed three deep wells of more than 3,000 meters. What is particularly encouraging is that good results have also been achieved in the work of finding new oil fields. In the past six years, due to a lack of experience and incomplete exploration methods, although eight structures had been explored, only two had small amounts of oil, and the rest had little effect; but in the past year alone, oil was found in three of the four structures that were explored. Among them, the Yauerxia and Malianquan areas, after oil testing, can self-spray, proving that they are oil reservoirs with industrial exploitation value. This discovery is not only of important practical significance for increasing crude oil production in our country, but also points the way for continuing to find new oil fields in western Gansu in the future.

In terms of oilfield development, the adoption of the latest development methods such as water and gas injection and oil layer fracturing has improved the oilfield development situation, enabling the crude oil plan to be completed by 102%, with an annual output exceeding the total of the ten years before liberation. At the same time, various refining indicators have also been overfulfilled, and sixteen new products have been successfully trial-produced. The total output value of the mine exceeded the plan by 17%, and the total cost was reduced by 10% compared with the plan, increasing production and saving more than 10 million yuan for the state.

In terms of worker training, a total of more than 30,000 people were organized to participate in cultural and technical studies last year, of which more than 14,000 workers were promoted due to improved technology; at the same time, we also supported fraternal factories and mines with more than 6,000 cadres and workers, including more than 900 cadres. More has also been done to improve the material and cultural life of workers than in any previous year. The average wage of workers has increased by 9.9%, more than 80,000 square meters of housing and dormitories have been built, 34 canteens have been built, the hospital has been expanded, and a new cinema has been built. In terms of the supply of non-staple foods, an average of three and three-quarter jin of meat and fish can be eaten per person per month. At the same time, the opening of the railway to Yumen in July last year has greatly changed the face of the oil mine. Today's Yumen Oil Mine is no longer a desolate Gobi Desert, but a petroleum city with a population of 70,000.

In short, the construction of the Yumen Oil Mine in 1956 has made great achievements. The basic reason for obtaining these achievements is the result of the correct industrialization policy of our country and the hard work of the vast number of workers in building socialism. Since Chairman Mao's instructions against right-leaning conservative thinking were issued, we have profoundly criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking of leaders lagging behind the masses and lagging behind reality, and the bureaucratic style of not understanding the situation below, on the basis of repeatedly mobilizing the masses, supported the growth and development of various advanced things, and greatly stimulated the labor enthusiasm of the vast number of workers. A mass production upsurge unprecedented in the entire mine quickly emerged, with 80% of the workers actively involved in the socialist competition centered on the advanced producer movement. At the same time, in the competition, due to the strengthening of specific organizational work, the various advanced experiences were systematically summarized and promoted, and continuously enriched and improved through the practice of the masses, so that the advanced experiences increased from the original 40-odd to more than 200, and the rationalization proposals from the masses reached 6,375, of which 3,051 have been adopted, more than double that of 1955.

Geological exploration work is the foundation of the petroleum industry. Because the geological conditions of the Jiuquan Basin are unusually complex and the types of oil reservoirs are very irregular, we have adopted the exploration policy of "active, cautious, long-term and meticulous" in this area; in actual work, we have constantly accepted the various lessons of the past, absorbing the good ones in a timely manner and correcting the bad ones immediately, thereby avoiding and reducing errors, accelerating the exploration process, and obtaining new oil fields. However, in the arduous process of finding new oil fields, it has not been smooth sailing. Due to the subjectivism and one-sidedness in our way of thinking, we often waver due to the gains and losses of the moment, manifested in being blindly optimistic due to overestimating some minor achievements at times; at other times, due to temporary setbacks, our morale is low and complaints arise. Experience has proven that in the struggle between man and nature, not only good wishes are needed, but also strong fighting spirit and perseverance, and a certain price must be paid to achieve victory and success.

Over the past year, we have deeply realized that only by continuously improving technology can social productivity continue to grow. The rapid development of production and construction in the Yumen Oil Mine last year was inseparable from the help of Soviet experts and the adoption of dozens of new technical measures such as radioactive isotopes; it was also inseparable from the active and creative labor of thousands of engineering and technical cadres under the call of the Party's policy on intellectuals. In the process of adopting these new technologies, we have constantly strengthened the education and practice of linking theory with reality based on the basic principle of "re-practice, re-understanding," established scientific research work, and popularized technical education for workers, so that a large number of workers have quickly mastered advanced technical knowledge. However, when adopting new technologies, if we do not analyze, study, or consider the specific conditions, and mechanically apply them, not only will the effect be poor, but it will also cause waste. For example, due to not carefully analyzing the regional conditions, we blindly purchased mechanical trenching machines, coupled with poor operation, resulting in efficiency lower than manual labor; the use of turbine drills, also due to the lack of organizational work and the excessively soft formation, resulted in costs higher than rotary drills. This shows that the adoption, enrichment, and improvement of new technologies must be combined with the actual situation and must have a process of practice; attempting to reach the sky in one step is not feasible.

From practice, we have also deeply realized that properly solving the material and cultural life problems of workers is an important aspect of socialist construction, because whether this problem can be correctly solved has a direct impact on the production enthusiasm of workers. The main problem currently existing in the Yumen Oil Mine in terms of the lives of workers is the shortage of housing, and most family members cannot come to the mine. This is a historical problem left over from the long-term exploitation of workers by reactionary bureaucratic capitalism. At the same time, due to the fact that the Yumen Oil Mine is far from urban and rural areas, the transportation line for building materials is long, and construction costs are high, it is extremely unrealistic to demand that this problem be solved immediately. Although active efforts have been made over the past few years, it will still take two or three years to basically meet the requirements of workers to bring their families. Therefore, in the current situation, it is necessary to strengthen ideological education for workers, so that workers have a clear understanding of the practical difficulties, and mobilize the masses to solve the difficulties themselves. This is the most effective way to overcome difficulties. For example, last year, self-managed public assistance solved one-third of the housing, and it is planned to continue to expand this year; the No. 2 workshop of the refinery was allocated three houses in December last year, but there were twelve households in need of housing, and the leaders were very embarrassed, because it was not appropriate to give them to anyone. Therefore, they adopted the method of organizing these twelve households to have a democratic discussion, and everyone willingly gave the houses to those who were most urgently in need. This fact shows that the handling of the living problems of workers cannot be separated from ideological education and the mass line. Whenever this can be done, it can be properly resolved; on the contrary, if the leadership simply takes care of it, not only will a lot of effort be spent, but things may not be done well. From this problem, it can also be seen that the effects of adopting bureaucratic methods or the mass line are completely different.

1957 is the final year of our First Five-Year Plan. In this year, the Yumen Oil Mine will be responsible for half of China's crude oil production tasks. According to the current oil production capacity of the oil fields, it is necessary to overcome many difficulties and make great efforts to achieve this task. But we firmly believe that under the central government's policy of increasing production and practicing economy and running enterprises diligently and thriftily, as long as we summarize and accept past experiences and lessons well, continue to deeply mobilize the masses, and rely on the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of workers, this year's work will achieve greater results than last year.

    玉门油矿的一年
    杨拯民的发言
    去年是玉门油矿发展变化最大的一年，油矿职工发挥了高度的劳动积极性，采用了最新的技术，因而获得很大成绩。今年，玉门油矿将担负着我国原油生产任务的一半。
    我衷心拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上的指示，完全同意周总理的报告和其他报告。现在仅就玉门油矿去年工作中的一些情况和问题，作如下发言：
    1956年是玉门油矿发展最快、变化最大的一年；也是我们全体职工为加速建成祖国第一个天然石油基地工作最紧张的一年。这一年来，在全国社会主义革命高潮的推动下，在党的第八次全国代表大会决议的鼓舞下，全矿职工建设社会主义的积极性比以往任何时期都为高涨。从我们执行1956年国家所给的任务来看，不仅情况是良好的，而且成绩是显著的。
    在地质勘探方面，上万名的地质勘探人员，在祁连山、戈壁滩与严寒、风沙进行了艰苦的搏斗。地质调查工作量完成了国家计划113％；地球物理工作量完成了148％；全年共打井二十二万八千多公尺，相当于1949年到1955年进尺的总和；到今年1月，钻井指标已提前完成了第一个五年计划。先进的3203钻井队并创造了年钻进一万多公尺的全国新纪录，平均钻机月速度达到一千零九十五公尺，接近了苏联一般先进钻井队的水平。我们的钻井工人不仅学会了打斜井和使用涡轮钻具，而且还掌握了深井钻探的技术，完成了三口三千公尺以上的深井。尤其令人振奋的是，在找寻新油田的工作上，也获得了良好的成果，过去六年来，由于缺乏经验，勘探方法不完备，虽然勘探过八个构造，但除两处发现少量含油外，其余均少成效；而去年一年中，在勘探的四个构造上，就有三处发现有油，其中鸭儿峡和马莲泉两地区，经试油后，均能自喷，证明是具有工业开采价值的油藏。这个发现，不仅对我国增产原油，有着重要的现实意义；而且也为今后在甘肃西部继续找寻新的油田，指明了方向。
    在油田开采方面，由于采用了注水注气、油层压裂等最新的开采方法，改善了油田开采的形势，使原油计划完成了102％，年产量超过解放前十年的总和。同时各种炼油指标，也都超额完成，试制成功了十六种新产品。全矿生产总值比计划超过17％，总成本比计划降低10％，为国家增产节约了一千余万元。
    在职工培训方面，去年共组织了三万余人参加文化、技术学习，其中有一万四千多名职工，由于提高了技术而晋了级；同时我们还向兄弟厂矿支援了六千多名干部和工人，其中干部九百余名。在改善职工物质文化生活上，也比以往任何一年都做的多，职工平均工资提高了9.9％，修建住宅、宿舍八万多平方公尺、食堂三十四座，扩大了医院，新建了一座电影院，在副食品的供应上，平均每人每月可吃肉食、鱼类三斤十五两。同时由于铁路去年7月通车玉门，使油矿面貌大为改观，今天的玉门油矿已不再是一片荒凉的戈壁滩，而是一个拥有七万人口的石油城了。
    总之，1956年玉门油矿的建设，成绩是很大的，能够获得这些成绩的基本原因，是由于我国工业化政策的正确和广大职工建设社会主义辛勤劳动的结果。自从毛主席的反右倾保守思想指示下达后，我们在反复发动群众的基础上，深刻地批判了领导落后于群众、落后于实际的右倾保守思想，和不了解下情的官僚主义作风，支持了各种先进事物的成长和发展，大大激发了广大职工的劳动热情，在全矿范围内迅速掀起了空前未有的群众性生产热潮，先后有80％的职工，积极投入了以先进生产者运动为中心的社会主义竞赛。同时在竞赛中，由于加强了具体的组织工作，有计划地总结和推广了各种先进经验，并通过群众的实践，不断加以丰富和提高，从而使先进经验由原来的四十余种增加至二百余种，来自群众的合理化建议达到六千三百七十五件，已采用三千零五十一件，较1955年增加了一倍。
    地质勘探工作，是石油工业的基础。由于酒泉盆地的地质情况异常复杂，油藏类型很不规律，因此我们在这个地区采取了“积极慎重、长期细致”的勘探方针；在实际工作中，又不断地接受了以往的各种教训，对于好的及时予以吸取，不好的立即加以纠正，从而避免和缩小了错误，加速了勘探的程序，获得了新的油田。但是在找寻新油田的艰苦过程中，并不是一帆风顺的，由于我们思想方法上的主观主义和片面性，常常因为一时一地的得失而摇摆不定，表现为有时候由于过高的估计某些微小的成果而盲目乐观；有时候又由于遭到暂时的挫折，便情绪低落，怨言丛生。经验证明，在人类与自然的斗争中，不仅需要良好的愿望，更加需要的是顽强的斗志和坚韧不拔的精神，并且必须付出一定的代价，才能获得胜利和成功。
    一年来，使我们深刻认识到，只有在不断提高技术的基础上，才能够使社会生产力不断增长。去年玉门油矿的生产与建设的突飞猛进，是与苏联专家的帮助，采用了放射性同位素等数十种新的技术措施分不开的；也是与数千名工程技术干部，在党的知识分子政策的感召下，进行了积极的、有创造性的劳动分不开的。在采用这些新技术的过程中，我们根据“再实践、再认识”的这一基本原理，不断地加强了理论联系实际的教育和作法，建立了科学研究工作，普及了职工的技术教育，使大批职工迅速掌握了先进的技术知识。但是在采用新技术的时候，如果不分析、不研究，不顾具体条件，机械地加以搬用，不仅效果不好，而且还会造成浪费。如由于没有仔细分析地区条件，盲目购置了机械挖沟机，加之操作不善，致使效率低于人工；使用涡轮钻具，也由于组织工作跟不上，地层太软，成本反高过旋转钻。这说明了，对新技术的采用、丰富和提高，必须结合实际情况，并且要有一个实践的过程，企图一步登天，是行不通的。
    从实践中，我们也深刻体会到，妥善地解决职工的物质文化生活问题，是社会主义建设的一个重要方面，因为这个问题能否正确解决，对职工的生产情绪有着直接的影响。玉门油矿当前在职工生活上，主要存在的问题是住宅少，大部分家属不能来矿，这是反动官僚资本主义长期剥削工人遗留下来的一个历史问题。同时由于玉门油矿远离城乡，建筑材料运输线长，施工费用高等困难，要求这一问题立即得到解决，是极不现实的。虽然经过几年来的积极努力，但要基本上满足职工的带家要求，还需要两、三年的时间。因此，在目前情况下，就必须加强对职工的思想教育，使职工对现实困难有清楚的了解，并发动群众自己动手解决困难，这是最有效的克服困难的办法。如去年自办公助解决的房子达三分之一，今年拟继续扩大；炼油厂二车间，去年十二月份，分到了三户住宅，但需要住宅的却有十二户，领导很为难，分给谁都不合适，于是他们采取了组织这十二户职工民主讨论的办法，大家心甘情愿地把房子分给了最迫切需要的人。这一事实说明，对职工生活问题的处理，不能离开思想教育和群众路线，凡是能够这样做，就可得到妥善的解决；相反的，只是领导包办、不仅力气花了不少，而事情不一定办好。从这个问题上，也可看出，采取官僚主义或群众路线的两种作法，其效果迥然是不同的。
    一九五七年是我们执行第一个五年计划的最后一年，在这一年中，玉门油矿将担负着我国原油生产任务的一半。按照现有油田的产油能力，要实现这一任务，必须克服不少困难，作出巨大的努力。但我们坚信：在中央增产节约、勤俭办企业的方针下，只要很好地总结与接受过去的经验教训，继续深入发动群众，依靠广大职工的积极性与创造性，今年的工作将会比去年获得更大的成果。（附图片）
