    Hydraulic Pumping Machine – Water Turbine Pump
    The water turbine pump is a water conservancy machine that uses water as power. It does not require any fuel, is simple to manage, and the machinery itself is not prone to problems, making it suitable for rural use. A small water turbine pump can irrigate three or four hundred mu of land, while a large one can irrigate one or two thousand mu, or even several thousand mu. It can also be used for power generation and sideline production, which is very popular among farmers.
    This is the first hydraulic pumping station built in Lianyuan County, Hunan Province, undergoing water testing.

    水力抽水机——水轮泵
    水轮泵是利用水作动力的水利机械。它不需要任何燃料，管理也很简单，机械本身又不容易出毛病，适合农村使用。小型水轮泵可以灌田三四百亩，大型的可以灌一两千亩至数千亩。还可以利用它发电、搞副业生产等，很受农民欢迎。
    这是湖南省在涟源县建成的第一个水力抽水机站正在试水。
