Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 9th: The Egyptian newspaper "Al-Ahram" stated on the 8th that the withdrawal of the last batch of Israeli troops from Egypt signifies the end of the aggression by the UK, France, and Israel, and that the political struggle has begun.

	It said that the political struggle will unfold on three issues – the Suez Canal itself, the passage of Israeli ships through the Gulf of Aqaba, and the UN administration of the Gaza Strip.

	"Al-Ahram" and "Al-Akhbar" both attacked the United States' "support for Israeli viewpoints on these three issues," and said that Egypt will wage its political struggle on these three fronts.

	"Al-Ahram," in discussing US President Eisenhower's opinion expressed at a press conference on the 7th that the status of the Gulf of Aqaba is that of an international waterway, said that President Eisenhower, when talking about the Middle East, "talked as if he were talking about Florida or Texas."

	"Al-Shaab" said in an article published on the same day that Eisenhower's statement and the statement by Israeli Ambassador to the United States Eban had an aroma of "aggression and threat," despite Israel's withdrawal from Egypt.

	The newspaper said that Egypt is determined to defend its sovereignty and territorial waters "at any cost" if Israel carries out its rumored plan to send a "test" ship into the Gulf of Aqaba.

Xinhua News Agency, March 9th: The United States, Britain, and France are stepping up their activities in an attempt to force Egypt to accept their temporary plans that infringe upon Egypt's sovereignty over the canal issue. A US State Department spokesman said on the 8th, "We are waiting to hear Egypt's opinion on this proposal, the Four-Power temporary plan, and hope for a solution that conforms to the rights and obligations of Egypt and the canal users."

	International News Service said that the State Department "said this with the clear intention of mobilizing world opinion to exert pressure on Egypt." The Four-Power temporary plan mentioned by the State Department spokesman was recently put forward to Egypt through the United Nations by the United States, Britain, France, and Norway. This plan stipulates that before an agreement is reached on the canal management issue, Suez Canal tolls should be paid to the World Bank, with half frozen by the World Bank and the other half given to Egypt as canal tolls.

	International News Service also reported that before the canal can accommodate larger ships, the United States will conduct intense diplomatic activities through the United Nations to force Egypt to agree to some kind of agreement. The news agency believes that the three countries' refusal to unfreeze Egyptian assets is also a way to exert pressure on Egypt.

	A French Foreign Ministry spokesman also declared on the 8th that Western countries have been conducting "close consultations" on the Suez Canal issue for several weeks, and he also threatened to confront Egypt with a so-called "united Western diplomatic front."

	News from London said that Britain is also urging Egypt to immediately respond to the Four-Power "temporary plan."

### 不许把亚喀巴湾变成国际水道  埃及报纸驳斥艾森豪威尔  美英法仍企图侵犯埃及对运河主权

    不许把亚喀巴湾变成国际水道
    埃及报纸驳斥艾森豪威尔
    美英法仍企图侵犯埃及对运河主权
    新华社开罗9日电　埃及“金字塔报”8日说，最后一批以色列军队撤出埃及意味着英、法、以三国的侵略的结束，而政治斗争已经开始。
    它说，政治斗争将在三个问题上展开——苏伊士运河本身的问题，以色列船只通过亚喀巴湾的问题和加沙地带的联合国管理问题。
      “金字塔报”和“消息报”都攻击美国“在这三个问题上对以色列观点的支持”，并且说，埃及将在这三条战线上进行它的政治斗争。
      “金字塔报”在谈到美国总统艾森豪威尔7日在记者招待会上关于亚喀巴湾的地位是一条国际水道的意见时说，艾森豪威尔总统在谈到中东时“好像他是在谈到佛罗里达州或得克萨斯州”。
      “人民报”在同一天发表的一篇文章中说，艾森豪威尔的声明和以色列驻美国大使伊班的声明具有
  “侵略和威胁”的气味，尽管以色列撤出了埃及。
    这家报纸说，埃及决心“不惜任何代价”保卫它的主权和领海，如果以色列执行它的传闻中的要派遣一艘“试验性”船只进入亚喀巴湾的计划的话。
    新华社9日讯　美、英、法三国正在加紧活动，企图迫使埃及在运河问题上接受它们侵犯埃及主权的临时计划。美国国务院发言人在8日说，“我们正等着听取埃及对这项建议、四国临时计划的意见，并且希望会有一个符合埃及和运河使用国的权利和义务的解决。”
    国际新闻社说，国务院“说这番话的目的显然是想要发动世界舆论向埃及施加压力”。国务院发言人所提到的四国临时计划，是美国、英国、法国和挪威不久前通过联合国向埃及提出的，这项计划规定，在运河管理问题没有达成协议以前，苏伊士运河通航费应该向世界银行缴纳，一半由世界银行冻结起来，另一半交给埃及作为运河通行费。
    国际新闻社的消息还说，在运河能够通行较大的船只以前，美国将通过联合国进行紧张的外交活动以迫使埃及同意某种协议。这家通讯社认为，三国拒绝解冻埃及的财产也是向埃及施加压力的办法之一。
    法国外交部发言人8日也声明说，几个星期以来，西方国家一直在苏伊士运河问题上进行“密切的商讨”，他并且扬言要以所谓“团结一致的西方外交阵线”来对付埃及。
    来自伦敦的消息说，英国也在催促埃及对四国“临时计划”立即提出答复。
