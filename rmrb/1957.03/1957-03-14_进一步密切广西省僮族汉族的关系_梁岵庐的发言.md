    Further Strengthen the Relationship Between Zhuang and Han Nationalities in Guangxi Province
    Liang Kihu's Speech
    Chairman Mao mentioned the issue of ethnic minorities in his speech at the Supreme State Conference. I come from Guangxi, a province with many ethnic groups, and am attending the meeting as a non-voting delegate. I would like to briefly share some of my thoughts on this issue. Guangxi Province includes more than ten ethnic minorities such as Zhuang, Dong, Miao, and Yao. Among the province's more than 18 million people, the Zhuang people account for more than 6.4 million. It is not only the most populous ethnic minority in Guangxi, but also the most populous ethnic minority in the country.
    The Zhuang people are the ancient Luo Yue people, and the name "Zhuang" only appeared in records in the Song Dynasty. They have a long history in Guangxi. The opening of Guilin, Nanhai, and Xiang counties in the Qin Dynasty, a vast area, was where the Zhuang people migrated south and settled. In the Han Dynasty, more than 100,000 people were contacted in Yulin County and given official hats and belts. Since the Tang and Song Dynasties, Huangdong and Nongdong have become even larger, with the area around the present-day Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture in Guangxi as the center. Successive rulers have continuously oppressed the various ethnic minorities in Guangxi. In Guilin, Guangxi, there are still large inscriptions such as the "Tang Dali Pacifying Barbarians Stele" and the "Great Song Pacifying Barbarians Stele." The so-called "pacifying barbarians" refers to the Zhuang people. There are also many stone inscriptions "pacifying Yao" and "pacifying Miao" since the Yuan Dynasty. The Zhuang people have the largest population and the widest land, and the suffering they have endured is naturally deeper. From the perspective of ethnic characteristics, the Zhuang people not only have a common language, a common region, and a common economic life, but also have an excellent traditional culture. This can be evidenced by bronze drums, Zhuang brocade, and the recently discovered ancient Zhuang murals. In particular, in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Jintian Uprising and the subsequent large-scale and long-term anti-Qing struggles led by the Heaven and Earth Society, the Sino-French War, and the Red Seventh Army revolutionary struggle, the Zhuang and Han people worked together to create a glorious page in history. This shows that the Han and Zhuang peoples have always lived together and shared weal and woe. Everyone is living under the socialist brilliance today. Since the Zhuang people have a population of more than 6 million, Guangxi Province should be established as the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in accordance with the Constitution. I believe this is an appropriate and necessary measure to implement the national policy. From the perspective of the Han people (including myself), we also have the responsibility to establish the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region based on the principle of national equality, so that the Zhuang people can be masters of their own affairs, make progress together, and complete the cause of socialist construction. At the same time, Guangxi is located on the edge of South China, and the establishment of an autonomous region can also enhance international fraternal friendship. We should recognize the great significance of this measure, correct incorrect thinking, and eliminate unnecessary concerns under the leadership of the Party, the government, and Chairman Mao in order to facilitate the implementation of the national policy and enable the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region to be realized as soon as possible.

### 进一步密切广西省僮族汉族的关系  梁岵庐的发言

    进一步密切广西省僮族汉族的关系
    梁岵庐的发言
    毛主席在最高国务扩大会议的讲话中，曾提到少数民族问题。我从多民族的广西而来，列席会议，现在谨就这一问题，略说一点感想。广西省内包括有僮、侗、苗、瑶等十多种少数民族。在全省一千八百多万人口中，僮族即占六百四十多万。它不仅是广西各少数民族中人口最多的一个，也是全国各少数民族中人口最多的一个。
    僮族为古代的骆越族，而僮族之称到宋代才见于纪载，在广西具有悠久的历史。秦代开辟桂林、南海、象郡，地区极广，即是僮族南迁聚居之处。汉代在郁林郡即联系了十多万人，给以冠带。唐宋以来，黄峒、侬峒更为壮大，而以现在广西桂西僮族自治州一带为重心。历代统治者对于广西境内各少数民族不断地加以压迫。广西桂林现还有“唐大历平蛮碑”“大宋平蛮碑”等大书沵刻的摩崖，所谓“平蛮”即是对僮族而言；其它所谓“平瑶”“平苗”的石刻，自元代以降也为数不少。僮族人口最多，土地最广，所遭受的痛苦当然也较深。从民族的特征来说，僮族不仅有其共同的语言，共同的地区，共同的经济生活，更具有优秀传统的文化。如铜鼓、僮锦以及最近发现的僮族古代壁画等，可以为证。尤其是在太平天国金田起义和以后由天地会所领导大规模而长期的反清斗争、中法战役以及红七军革命斗争中，僮族和汉族一道，创造了光荣历史的一页。这说明了汉、僮两族历来相处，患难相共。大家一同处在社会主义光辉照耀的今天，僮族既有六百多万人口，正应根据宪法将广西省建立为广西僮族自治区，我认为这是贯彻民族政策的适当而且必要的措施。从汉族来说（包括我个人在内），我们也有责任本着民族平等的原则，建立广西僮族自治区，使僮族当家作主，共同进步，完成社会主义建设事业。同时，广西处在华南的边缘，建立自治区以后并可增进国际的兄弟般情谊。我们应该认识到这一措施的重大意义，在党和政府及毛主席领导下，纠正不正确的思想，扫除不必要的顾虑，以利民族政策的执行，使广西僮族自治区得以早日实现。（附图片）
