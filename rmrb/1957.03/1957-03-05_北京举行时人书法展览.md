    Beijing Holds Contemporary Calligraphy Exhibition
    Xinhua News Agency report: More than one hundred and twenty calligraphers from Beijing, Shanghai, Henan and other places exhibited more than one hundred and eighty works at the Contemporary Calligraphy Exhibition held in Beihai Park, Beijing today. The calligraphy styles include oracle bone script, bronze inscriptions, seal script, official script, running script, cursive script, and regular script.
    Among these calligraphers are former Qing dynasty "Tanhua" degree holders, members of the Hanlin Academy, contemporary painters, and writers. Among the exhibits, some characters are as large as a dipper, while others are as small as fly heads. Some are vigorous, some are delicate, some are as simple and unsophisticated as Qin dynasty bronzes and Han dynasty tiles, and some are as unrestrained as a heavenly horse soaring through the sky. The running script of the famous calligrapher Shen Yinmo is not only masterful, but also full of vividness and rhythm. The regular script of landscape painter Wu Hufan also carries his painting characteristics. When visiting, the audience praised incessantly and were reluctant to leave.
    The exhibits also include more than twenty pieces of bronze and stone carvings, as well as newly carved poems of Chairman Mao by the seal engraving artists of the Fine Arts Department of the Beijing Art Enterprise Company.
    The works of six Japanese calligraphers and some large-character calligraphy works by Japanese middle school students displayed in the exhibition were gifts exchanged between them and Chinese calligraphers and Chinese students. This exhibition was organized by the Beijing Chinese Calligraphy Research Society.

    北京举行时人书法展览
    新华社讯  北京、上海、河南等地的一百二十多位书法家，今天在北京市北海公园举行的时人书法展览会上展出了一百八十多件作品，字体有甲骨、鼎彝、篆、隶、行、草、楷等。
    在这些书法家中有前清的探花、翰林、当代的画家、文学家等。展品中，字大的如斗，小的如蝇头。有的刚健，有的秀丽，古朴的如秦金汉瓦，奔放的像天马行空。著名书法家沈尹默的行书，不光工夫到家，而且气韵生动。山水画家吴湖帆的楷书也带着他那绘画的特色。观众在参观的时候不住地啧啧称赞，不忍离去。
    展览品中还附有二十多件金石篆刻，及北京市艺术企业公司美术部篆刻艺人新刻的毛主席的数阕诗词。
    展览会中陈列的六位日本书法家的作品和一部分日本中学生的大楷是他们和中国书法家及中国学生交换的礼物。这次展览是由北京中国书法研究社举办的。
