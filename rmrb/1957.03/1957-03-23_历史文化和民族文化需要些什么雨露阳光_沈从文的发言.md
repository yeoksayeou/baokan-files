These past few days, hearing the important reports from Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and Vice Premier Li, has deepened my understanding of the solemnity and arduousness of the socialist construction work being carried out by the 600 million people of our motherland under the correct leadership of the Party and the government. The reports touched on issues such as culture, education, and ethnic policies. As a cultural worker who grew up in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, I would like to talk about what kind of rain and sunshine "historical culture" and "national culture" need for a hundred flowers to bloom, based on my current work and impressions from returning to my hometown for observation. I am currently doing research work at the National Museum of History and the Palace Museum. In the few years since liberation, due to the government's and the people's emphasis on the cultural heritage of the motherland, the museum business has been developing by leaps and bounds. In 1956, the number of museum visitors nationwide exceeded 10 million. Last year, the National Museum of History and the Palace Museum together had about 2.11 million visitors. After the National Museum of History expanded its external service work, it came into contact with about 200 cultural and educational research institutions, military units, and production units across the country. Last year alone, the supply of photographic materials and cultural relic models reached 100,000 yuan. These figures together illustrate a new problem, which is that in the process of national development and marching towards culture and science, all departments urgently need to help each other. Museum work will inevitably become increasingly heavy as a result. In order to adapt to this new situation, it is worth carefully considering how to strengthen research in the future, how to expand external services, and how brother institutions can coordinate with each other in order to better complete their solemn tasks. If we are good at using human and material resources, "saving and increasing production" can also show significant results in this regard. Here, I would like to put forward four suggestions for the members to comment on:

First, I hope to strengthen the research work on cultural relics in museums in various provinces and cities across the country, especially the research work on cultural relics in the National Museum of History and the Palace Museum in Beijing, where the capital is located. The working conditions of researchers need to be improved. The focus of research can be placed on two aspects: historical cultural relic systems and material cultural achievements, so as to better serve domestic historical scientific research and new production requirements. Within the scope of the whole country, we should first expand the exchange system of cultural relic research materials among brother museums, and appropriately transfer some cultural relics unearthed in various places and cultural relics collected in various places to enrich the content of the exhibition in the National Museum of History in Beijing.

Second, improve the methods of historical relic research work and promote the coordination of various aspects of work. In recent years, the work of collecting and excavating cultural relics across the country can be said to have achieved unprecedented and amazing results. The Shanghai Cultural Relics Management Committee has achieved the best results in collecting cultural relics. The five hundred young archaeological workers distributed in various infrastructure construction sites across the country have made the greatest contribution to excavating cultural relics. Their hard work and achievements are no less than those of outstanding soldiers on any production front. In terms of research work, due to insufficient staffing, the work performance is relatively poor. We know that hundreds of thousands of unearthed cultural relics and important collections in various parts of the country can enrich the people's infinite new knowledge of the motherland's historical culture. At present, the vast majority are still close to being frozen in warehouses everywhere. The lack of talent is a fact, and we should address the reality and consider using qualified comprehensive universities or museums to train talents for tomorrow's use. In short, the current situation urgently needs to be improved. Because if cultural relics cannot be combined with documentary research, they will inevitably be like the appreciation of gold, stone, calligraphy and painting in the past, and cannot fully play their due role. If a historical science worker still only knows how to engage in literature and is not good at using new evidence presented by ancient cultural relics to conduct comprehensive research, it will also form a state of stagnation, and the conclusions will inevitably turn into empty dogmas. Especially in several departments belonging to the history of material culture, the history of cultural relic systems, and the history of crafts and arts, it is impossible to draw correct conclusions by seeking evidence in isolation from documents without cultural relics. If this continues for a long time, a new historical science based on Marxism-Leninism will not be established. Marching towards culture and science, this department's work will lag behind. Because the custody of cultural relics belongs to the system of the Ministry of Culture, and the research and teaching of literature and history belong to the system of the Ministry of Education or the Ministry of Higher Education, there is not enough contact between each other's work, so the following phenomenon has formed: Some people teach archaeology in universities but do not know much about cultural relics. Some local warehouses have tens of thousands of cultural relics frozen, and even feel that there is nowhere to pile them up, but the schools send people to Beijing to find materials. Several cultural management committees can list materials in excavation reports, but cannot say what problems the materials have solved and what problems they have enlightened. Dear members, this state should not continue! I suggest that the cultural and educational departments set up an organization as soon as possible to jointly study, change isolation into cooperation, make some adjustments in talent, and make some arrangements in work.

Third, the neglect of national culture urgently needs to be remedied. Since liberation, the government's implementation of ethnic policies can be said to be very correct and incomparably great. In terms of economic construction and cultural education, many important measures that are beneficial to the permanent interests of the people have been taken, and the original backward situation of the region has been fundamentally improved. The counties under the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture are adjacent to eastern Sichuan and eastern Guizhou, and have always been the object of ravage and destruction by warlords, local tyrants, corrupt officials and bureaucrats. In the past, the three provinces planted a large amount of opium, which not only poisoned the local people, but also often transported 500 or 800 dan of opium out of the country, poisoning more Chinese people. After liberation, after several movements, all corrupt personnel have been completely eliminated, and the social situation and production have undergone great changes. Recently, all townships and districts in the autonomous prefecture have telephones and radio broadcasts, and news from Beijing can be obtained on the same day. All counties have access to automobiles, transporting a large amount of oil, hemp, bamboo, wood, medicinal materials, grain and local products to support the construction of the motherland. Young people have also generally realized the glorious responsibility of "controlling steel to conquer nature" and building their hometowns and the motherland. In the past, among hundreds of thousands of Miao people, very few received university education, and those who received secondary education were also children of landlords. Now there are several ethnic middle schools, each with thousands of students, and some ordinary middle schools also have Miao classes. In addition, many students are studying at the Central, Central South, and Nationalities Institutes and various specialized technical schools, and children of middle and poor peasants account for a large proportion. In Jishou, where the autonomous prefecture's political power is located, there are also thousands of civil engineering workers and brick and tile workers engaged in the basic construction of schools, hospitals, cultural buildings, etc. Many local and foreign young cadres are rooted in the countryside and live in harmony with the people. The people's political awakening and educational improvement prove that the Party's ethnic policies have achieved remarkable success in this region. The only shortcoming is that we have not had time to pay attention to national culture. Cultural work is generally close to being top-down. Local music, songs and dances have attracted appropriate attention in recent years. Due to the success of overseas performances, there are plans to organize a national song and dance troupe of about 60 people. The new buildings in this prefecture do not show any local style or characteristics in decoration. In addition, an extremely important department of national culture, the local handicrafts such as exquisitely crafted, beautifully patterned woven goods, embroidery, and drawnwork, we are really not concerned enough about. In the central and southern and southwestern multi-ethnic regions, these things that have been created by hundreds of millions of people through long-term hard work and ingenuity due to the needs of life and the love of beauty are not just ordinary handicrafts. They can represent the cultural achievements of the local people, and they are also an important cultural heritage of China. The Central Academy of Fine Arts and the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts, in their new teaching and research work, should regard these materials as being as important as the exquisite heritage of historical culture. If some daily light industrial production is good at learning from it and reflecting some patterns on new production, and the construction department reflects it on new decoration and colored paintings, it will inevitably be welcomed by the vast number of people. However, due to social traditional habits, the neglect or contempt for national culture has destroyed a lot over the years, and it is still being destroyed. Dear members, this is not acceptable! There are countless good flowers here that are far more important than the calligraphy and painting of bureaucratic literati in the past three hundred years! We must get rid of the remnants of Han chauvinism and have a newer and more correct view to treat this issue. We should attach importance to the heritage jointly created by all ethnic groups in this ethnic family to enrich the content of the motherland's culture and enrich the lives of modern people. We also hope that the Ministry of Culture and the State Ethnic Affairs Commission will jointly discuss this matter earnestly. Some work that has been done by the Central Institute for Nationalities or provincial and municipal institutes for nationalities and cultural bureaus needs to be strengthened and deepened, and through this work, to train cultural and artistic cadres in brother ethnic regions. Local cultural centers should have some excellent and enthusiastic professional cadres and cooperate with local art teachers to participate in local production and construction, give play to their strength, and form a hundred flowers blooming in this area.

Fourth, expand the business of museums and strengthen their ties with all aspects. In particular, all colleges and universities across the country should obtain strong assistance from the central and provincial and municipal cultural relic departments in order to facilitate new literature and history research and teaching work, so as to establish or enrich reference rooms with appropriate cultural relics and rich pictures. In important handicraft production areas, and in several light industrial production departments that are closely related to the lives of the vast number of people (such as silk, embroidery, ceramics, lacquerware, glass and enamel, fancy tiles and porcelain, etc.), in order to respect the traditional achievements of the working people of the motherland, educate and encourage the new generation of producers engaged in this department, improve and improve the patterns and shapes of new products, we should also obtain the full assistance of cultural departments, and as needed, timely establish reference rooms. The cultural relic publishing department should also consider allocating some printing power to carry out publishing and supply in response to these two needs.

All good flowers need rain and sunshine, and even more they cannot lack the nutrients absorbed from the fertile soil at their roots. The purpose of a few suggestions is only one, which is to accelerate the progress of the research work on the motherland's historical culture and national culture, so that it can serve the needs of new departments and create new flowers blooming on this basis.

I hope to receive guidance and correction for any inaccuracies or one-sidedness in what I have said. (Attached picture)

    历史文化和民族文化需要些什么雨露阳光
　　沈从文的发言
    这几天听到毛主席、周总理、李副总理的重要报告，让我加深一层明白祖国六亿人民在党和政府正确领导下，进行社会主义建设工作的庄严和责任的艰巨。报告中有涉及文化教育民族政策诸问题部分，我是一个文化工作者，又生长在湘西苗族自治州，因此想就目前工作范围和回乡视察印象，谈谈“历史文化”和“民族文化”方面的百花齐放，需要些什么雨露阳光。我目下在历史博物馆和故宫博物院两机关做研究工作。解放几年来，由于政府和人民对祖国文化遗产的重视，博物馆事业大有一日千里的趋势。1956年全国博物馆观众已过一千万人。历博、故宫两个博物馆观众，去年也共同约有二百十一万人。历史博物馆扩大对外服务工作后，和全国文教研究机关、部队和生产单位发生接触，共约二百处，仅供应照像资料、文物模型，去年一年中就达十万元。这些数字共同说明一个新问题，就是在国家发展过程中，向文化科学进军，各个部门都迫切需要彼此帮助。博物馆工作，必然因此日益繁重。为适应这个新的情况，今后研究如何加强，对外服务如何展开，兄弟机关如何相互协调，才能够更好一些完成它的庄严任务，都值得慎重考虑。如善于使用人力物力，“节约增产”在这方面也可以见出显著成效。在这里，个人拟提出四点建议，请各位委员指教：
    第一，盼加强全国各省市博物馆的文物研究工作，特别是首都所在北京历史博物馆和故宫博物院的文物研究工作。研究人员工作条件需改善。研究重点可考虑放在历史文物制度和物质文化成就两方面，便于配合国内历史科学研究和新的生产要求而服务。在全国范围内，首先应当扩大兄弟馆文物研究资料的交换制度。并适当调动部分各地出土文物，和各地收集文物，充实北京历史博物馆陈列内容。
    第二，改进历史文物研究工作的方法，促进各方面工作的协调。几年来，全国文物收集发掘的工作，成绩可说空前惊人。收集文物成绩最好的是上海文管会。发掘文物贡献最大的是分布全国各个基建工地五百余年青的考古工作者，他们工作的辛苦和成就，不下于任何生产战线上的优秀战士。在研究工作方面，由于人力配备不足，工作成绩就比较差。国内各地百十万件出土文物和重要收集品，我们知道，这些文物实可丰富人民对于祖国历史文化无限新知识，目前绝大部分还近于冻结在各处库房中。人材不足是事实，应针对现实，考虑利用有条件综合性大学或博物馆，来培养明日合用的人材。总之，目下情况亟需想法改进。因为文物如不能结合文献研究，不免如过去金石文玩的鉴赏，无从充分发挥应有的作用。一个历史科学工作者，如依旧只会搞文献，不善于运用古文物提出的新证据，来综合进行研究工作，也会形成一种停滞状态，结论且不免转入空洞教条。特别是属于物质文化史、文物制度史、工艺美术史若干部门，离开文物从文献孤立求证，是不会得出正确结论的。如果长此继续下去，新的以马列思想为基础的历史科学，是建立不起来的。向文化科学进军，这部门工作会要落后。由于文物保管属文化部系统，文史研究教学属教育部或高教部系统，彼此工作联系不够，因此竟形成如下现象：有在大学教考古学，却对文物不当行的。也有当地仓库冻结文物数万件，甚至于感到无处堆放，学校方面却派人来北京找材料的。若干文管会，发掘报告能罗列材料，却说不出材料解决了些什么问题，启发了些什么问题。诸位委员，这种状态是不宜继续下去的！我建议文教部门及早成立一个机构，共同研究一下，变孤立成协作，在人材上能作些调整，在工作上能有些安排。
    第三，对民族文化的忽视，亟待补救。解放以来，政府对于民族政策的执行，可说十分正确而又无比伟大。在经济建设、文化教育各方面，都作过许多有益人民永久利益的重要措施，基本改善了原来地区落后状况。湘西苗族自治州所属各县与川东黔东接壤，历来是军阀土劣贪官污吏蹂躏摧残的对象。三省过去都大量栽种过鸦片烟，不仅毒化了本地人民，还经常五百石八百石出境外运，毒化过更多中国人民。解放后，经过几次运动，一切腐败人事已全部铲除，社会情形、生产方面面貌大变。近来自治州各乡区都有了电话和广播收音，北京消息当天可得。各县都有汽车通行，把大量油、麻、竹、木、药材以及粮食土产外运，来支援祖国的建设。青年人还普遍意识到“驾驭钢铁征服自然”，建设家乡建设祖国的光荣责任。过去数十万苗族，受大学教育的极少，受中等教育的也是些地主子弟。现在已有好几个民族中学，各有上千学生，普通中学有的也另设苗族班。此外中央、中南、民族学院及各种专科技术学校，都有不少学生，中农贫农子弟占比例极大。在自治州政权所在地吉首，还有几千土木工人，和烧砖制瓦工人，在进行学校、医院、文化大楼等基本建设。许多本地和外来青年干部，工作都扎根在乡村，和人民生活打成一片。人民在政治上的觉醒和教育上的提高，证明党的民族政策，在这个地区，已经得到显著的成功。美中不足处是民族文化还来不及注意。文化工作一般近于自上而下。当地音乐歌舞，近年来虽已引起适当的注意，由于外出会演成功，进而有组织六十人左右的民族歌舞团计划。本州新建筑，在装饰上就还见不出任何地方风格和特征。还有民族文化中极其重要一个部门，当地制作精工花纹壮美的编织物、刺绣、挑花等等手工艺美术品，我们关心实在很不够。在中南、西南多民族区域，这些由于生活需要和爱美情感，千百年千万人通过长时期勤劳和智巧的积累，所创造出的东东西西，其实不仅仅是一种普通工艺品，既能代表当地人民的文化成就，同时也是全中国一份重要文化遗产。中央美术学院和中央工艺美术研究所，在新的教学和研究工作上，都值得把这些材料看得和历史文化中精美遗产同等重要。若干日用轻工业生产，如善于取法，把部分图案反映到新的生产上，建筑部门反映到新的装饰彩绘上，都必然可得到广大人民的欢迎。但是，由于社会传统习惯，对于民族文化的忽视或轻视，多年来毁去的实在已不少了，目下还在毁坏过程中。各位委员，这是不成的！这里还有无数的好花，远比近三百年官僚文人字画重要得多！我们必须要去掉大汉族主义的意识残余，有一个较新一些也更加正确一些的看法，来对待这个问题。重视这个民族大家庭各民族共同创造的遗产，来充实祖国文化的内容，丰富现代人民的生活。这件事情，也盼望文化部和民族事务委员会共同来切实商讨一下。有些地区中央民族学院或省市民族学院、文化局已做的工作，还待加强和深入，并通过这个工作，来培养兄弟民族地区文化艺术干部。地方文化馆，应当有些优秀热情的专业干部，和当地美术教员协作，参预地方生产和建设，发挥出力量，形成这方面百花齐放。
    第四，扩大博物馆的业务，并加强它和各方面的联系。特别是全国各高等学校，为便于进行新的文史研究和教学工作，应当取得中央及各省市文物部门大力的协助，为建立或充实有适当文物和丰富图片的参考资料室。有重要手工业生产区，和若干对广大人民生活有密切关系的轻工业生产部门（例如丝绸、刺绣、陶瓷、漆器及玻璃和搪瓷、花砖瓷等），为尊重祖国劳动人民传统的成就，教育鼓励新一代从事这一部门的生产者，提高改进新产品的花纹图案和造形，也应当取得文化部门的全力协助，各就需要，适时的、为建立参考资料室。文物出版部门，并且值得考虑匀出部分印刷力量，针对这两方面需要，来进行出版供应。
    一切好花都需要雨露阳光，更不能缺少从本根吸取肥沃土壤中的养料。几点建议目的只是一个，就是加速祖国历史文化和民族文化的研究工作的进展，好让它在新的各部门需要来服务，从这个基础上作成新的百花齐放。
    我说的不对处，片面处，还盼望得到指教和纠正。（附图片）
