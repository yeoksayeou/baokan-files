Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 26th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru stated in the Lok Sabha (People's House) of the Indian Parliament on the 25th: "The path to peace lies in reaching agreements to reduce military treaties, rather than expanding military treaty areas."

Nehru said, "We have enough evidence to show that these military treaties have not helped the cause of peace and security. But unfortunately, these treaties still exist and are even expanding." This statement was seen as referring to the United States' announcement of its participation in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee.

Nehru spoke first during the debate on foreign affairs in the Lok Sabha. He suggested that U.S. President Eisenhower and Soviet leaders hold a meeting to discuss the current "difficult and serious" world situation.

Nehru said that while there have been some encouraging developments in certain regions of the world, "I cannot say that I can be optimistic about the overall atmosphere in the world."

Regarding the Middle East situation, he said: "There are signs that a satisfactory solution can be reached in making the Suez Canal operational. If the question of how to make this canal serve the international community while safeguarding Egypt's sovereignty can be resolved, it would be a great gain."

He said that although the opening of the canal would greatly help to ease tensions in the Middle East, the opening of the canal itself would not solve all the problems in the Middle East. Difficulties still exist in Gaza, in the Gulf of Aqaba, and in the general situation in the Middle East. Looking at the world situation today, the Middle East region may be said to be "the most difficult and potentially explosive region."

Nehru said that the Middle East situation continues to be difficult "not because it is inherently difficult, but because some people are bringing conflicts from outside the Middle East into the region." He mentioned military treaties in this regard, and said that what has happened in the Middle East in the past few months is the result of such treaties.

He said that compared with the North Atlantic Treaty and the Warsaw Pact, India is more directly affected by the Baghdad Pact and the Southeast Asia Treaty. Therefore, India holds a "suspicious and resentful" attitude towards these two treaties. He said, "On the issue of the Kashmir dispute, the Baghdad Pact and the Southeast Asia Treaty have been used against us (India)." He also said that these two treaties brought the Cold War to India's doorstep.

Nehru reiterated his earlier suggestion to hold a new summit meeting of major powers—especially a US-Soviet summit—to overcome the difficulties in the international situation.

Referring to the Eisenhower Doctrine and Soviet proposals on the Middle East, Nehru said he did not want to criticize these proposals at this stage. But he said he did not doubt that the Eisenhower proposals, especially those concerning economic assistance, had "great value." He also did not doubt that many of the Soviet proposals were also "helpful"—at least on the surface. He said that one thing that bothered him was the idea that the West Asia region is a vacuum that must be filled by someone coming in from the outside. That is a dangerous view, and it is an unrealistic view. He said: "Any power vacuum in this region can only be filled by the people of that country through their own political and other developments. If a foreign country wants to fill this vacuum, or tries to establish a sphere of influence, then hostile groups will immediately suspect the country's intentions and take measures to establish its own sphere of influence in the same region or elsewhere."

Nehru recalled the arrangement made by the major powers at the Geneva Conference two years ago not to interfere militarily in the Indochina countries. He said that this arrangement not only stopped the war, but also helped to gradually improve the situation there. The approach applicable to Indochina is equally applicable to other regions. He called for a policy of non-interference and an agreement between the major powers to rely less and less on military treaties.

Speaking of India's relationship with the Commonwealth, Nehru said for the first time that this is something that needs to be reconsidered from time to time as circumstances change. He said that he has been considering this issue more than in the past, due to what happened in the Middle East and the attitude taken by certain Commonwealth countries on the Kashmir issue, "These countries are certainly not fair, nor are they neutral, they are siding with the aggressors." However, under the current circumstances, it is appropriate for India to remain in the Commonwealth.

Nehru said: "If there had not been so much foreign interference, then Pakistan and India would have been much easier to resolve the problems between the two sides after partition." He reiterated India's claim to the part of Kashmir controlled by Pakistan, but he stated that India would not take military steps to "recover" these areas.

### 尼赫鲁建议美苏领袖会商世界局势　反对扩大军事条约地区和由外国填补真空

    尼赫鲁建议美苏领袖会商世界局势
　　反对扩大军事条约地区和由外国填补真空
    新华社新德里26日电　印度总理尼赫鲁25日在印度国会人民院说：“和平的道路在于达成协议使军事条约愈来愈少，而不是扩大军事条约地区。”
    尼赫鲁说，“我们已经有足够的证据表明这些军事条约对于和平和安全的事业并没有什么帮助。但是不幸这些条约仍然存在，并且甚至扩大了。”他这样说被认为是指美国宣布参加巴格达条约军事委员会这件事。
    尼赫鲁在人民院开始外交问题辩论的时候首先发言。他建议美国总统艾森豪威尔和苏联领袖们举行会议，讨论目前的“困难和严重的”世界局势。
    尼赫鲁说，虽然世界上某些地区有着一些令人鼓舞的发展，“但是我却不能说，对于世界上总的气氛可以抱乐观态度”。
    关于中东局势，他说：“有迹象表明，在使苏伊士运河发挥作用这方面可以获得一个令人满意的解决办法。如何使这条运河为国际大家庭服务，同时又保障埃及的主权，如果这个问题能够解决，那就会是一个很大的收获。”
    他说，运河的开放虽然会相当地有助于缓和中东的紧张局势，然而运河开放本身并不会解决中东所有的问题。在加沙方面，在亚喀巴湾方面，一般地说在中东局势方面仍然存在着困难。看看今日世界形势，中东地区也许可以说是“最困难最具有爆炸可能性的地区”。
    尼赫鲁说，中东局势继续困难，“并不是因为它本来就困难，而是因为有人把中东外面的冲突引到那里”。他在这方面提到军事条约，并且说，过去几个月中东发生的事情都是这种条约的结果。
    他说，同北大西洋公约和华沙条约比较，印度受巴格达条约和东南亚条约的影响更加直接。所以印度对这两个条约抱“怀疑和讨厌”的态度。他说，“在关于克什米尔纠纷的问题上，巴格达条约和东南亚条约被用来反对我们（印度）”。他还说，这两个条约把冷战带到印度大门口。
    尼赫鲁重新提出他在前些时候提出来的建议，也就是举行新的大国首脑会议——特别是美苏首脑会议，来克服国际局势中的困难。
    尼赫鲁在谈到艾森豪威尔主义和苏联关于中东问题的建议时说，他不想在目前阶段批评这些建议。但是他说，他不怀疑艾森豪威尔建议，特别是那些关于经济援助的建议有“很大价值”。他也不怀疑苏联提出的许多建议也是“有帮助的”——至少表面上是这样。他说，有一件事情使他烦恼，那就是关于西亚地区是必须由外面进来的某人来填充的真空的观念。那是危险的看法，并且是不现实的看法。他说：“这个地区的任何力量真空，只能够由那个国家的人民通过他们自己政治上和其他方面的发展来加以填充。如果一个外来的国家想要填充这种真空，或者试图建立势力范围，那么敌对的集团立刻会怀疑这个国家的意图，并且采取在同一地区或其他地方建立它自己的势力范围的政策。”
    尼赫鲁回顾了两年前大国在日内瓦会议上所作出的不在军事上干涉印度支那国家的安排。他说，这种安排不仅制止了战争，并且有助于逐步改善那里的局势。适用于印度支那的办法同样适用于其他地区。他呼吁采取不干涉政策，大国之间达成协议，双方越来越少地依靠军事条约。
    在谈到印度同英联邦的关系的时候，尼赫鲁第一次说，这是一件由于情况的变化需要时常加以重新考虑的事情。他说，他已经在比过去更多地考虑这个问题，这是由于中东所发生的事情以及某些英联邦国家在克什米尔问题上所采取的态度，“这些国家当然不是公正的，也不是中立的，它们同侵略者站在一边”。然而，在目前情况下，印度继续留在英联邦内是适宜的。
    尼赫鲁说：“假如不是外国进行了这样多的干涉，那末，巴基斯坦和印度在分治以后是会更加容易得多地解决双方之间的问题。”他重申印度对巴基斯坦所控制的部分克什米尔地区的要求，但是他表示印度不会采取军事步骤来“收复”这些地方。
