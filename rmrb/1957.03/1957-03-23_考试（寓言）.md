　　The Examination (Fable)
　　Wei Jinzhi
　　A store wanted to recruit a salesperson, and three people came to take the test.
　　What would the examination be about? No one knew. A was good at abacus calculations, and B had excellent eloquence. Both believed they were very confident. As for C, although he had many strengths, he felt that he didn't have any special features, and he was really a bit apprehensive.
　　The three people sat down in the living room, waiting for the examination.
　　This store was very particular. Before the test, they first sent over three bowls of tangyuan (sweet glutinous rice balls). They said that after eating the tangyuan, the examination would proceed. So the three people ate the tangyuan.
　　After eating the tangyuan, the manager came out to greet them. He first asked A: "How many tangyuan did you eat?" A was taken aback, then glanced at the tangyuan bowl. The bowl was empty, and even the soup was all drunk, so he had to shake his head and say, "I forgot!"
　　The manager asked B: "What about you?"
　　B said smugly: "Sixteen!"
　　"Then, what about him?" The manager pointed to A and asked B.
　　"This, I don't know! I only ate my own."
　　The manager turned around and asked C.
　　C replied: "Mr. A ate fifteen; I ate seventeen; Mr. B is right, his bowl had sixteen."
　　A, seeing that the situation was not good, immediately declared to the manager, "I... I... my abacus skills are very good!"
　　B also followed up with a self-introduction, saying, "I have some eloquence; I can deal with buyers."
　　The manager turned back to ask C: "What about you? Do you have anything to add?"
　　C shook his head and said, "No!"
　　So the manager smiled and said, "Those who think they have no ability probably have some ability. For example, Mr. C, even with such a small matter as eating snacks, he is mindful of himself and others. This is very rare. I intend to ask him to stay in our small shop."

　　考试（寓言）
　　魏金枝
    一家商店里要招收一个营业员，去应试的却有三个人。
    考试点什么呢？谁也不知道。甲是擅长于珠算的，乙则口才非常好，都以为自己很有把握。至于丙，虽然也有许多长处，却觉得没有什么特色，心里着实有点惶恐。
    三个人都在客厅里坐下来，等着考试。
    这家商店很讲究，未考之前，就先送来三碗汤圆。说是吃了汤圆，再进行考试。于是三个人就把汤圆吃了。
    吃了汤圆之后，经理先生就出来招呼他们。他先问甲：“你吃了几个汤圆？”甲吃了一惊，再瞟了一眼汤圆碗，碗是空的，连汤也喝得一点不剩了，只好摇摇头说：“忘了！”
    经理问乙：“你呢？”
    乙得意地说：“十六个！”
    “那么，他呢？”经理指指甲，又问乙。
    “这个，我可不知道了！我只吃我自己的。”
    经理转过身来问丙。
    丙回答说：“甲先生吃了十五个；我是十七个；乙先生说的不错，他那碗是十六个。”
    甲一看形势不对，马上向经理申明说：“我……我……我的珠算倒是很不错的！”
    乙也接着自我介绍说：“我有些口才，对于买主，我还能对付得下来。”
    经理回头来问丙：“你呢，有没有要补充说明的？”
    丙摇摇头说：“没有！”
    于是经理笑笑说：“凡是自以为没有本领的，大概都有一些本领。譬如丙先生，连吃点心这么一件小事，也留心着自己和别人，这是很难得的，我预备请他留在我们小号里。”
