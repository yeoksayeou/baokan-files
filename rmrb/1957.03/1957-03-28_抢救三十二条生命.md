　　Rescuing Thirty-Two Lives
    The Sichuan Worker's Daily published a front-page article on the 24th entitled "Rescuing Thirty-Two Lives," reporting the story of how thirty-two miners trapped underground in the Jijiang County Jixian Coal Mine due to a collapse were rescued.
    At around 5:00 PM on March 6th, a serious collapse occurred 2,000 meters underground in the Jijiang County Jixian Coal Mine. The collapsed area was more than six zhang (approximately 20 meters) long, and the roadway was blocked by collapsed rock and soil, trapping thirty-two miners inside.
    After news of the collapse spread, the Jijiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office, the Prefectural Trade Union Office, the Prefectural Industrial Bureau, and the Jijiang County People's Committee quickly dispatched more than a dozen cadres. The nearby Tianfu Coal Mine and the Yida Coal Mine in Longchang also sent experienced workers and rescue teams to the mine to conduct rescue operations.
    The Yida Coal Mine rescue team, led by Engineer Wang from the Sichuan Provincial Department of Industry, rushed to the mine and immediately went down into the pit without even taking a sip of water. At this time, the county head of Jijiang County also arrived at the mine to help resolve the materials needed for the rescue. Doctors from the Jijiang Prefectural Health Section were busy organizing medicine kits and bandages, preparing to provide first aid to the injured miners.
    The Jixian Coal Mine's roadways were very narrow, and coupled with limited technical conditions, the initial work of clearing the roadways was slow. In order to quickly rescue the miners trapped underground, experienced coal mine technicians and workers proposed suggestions to shorten the time for clearing the roadways.
    After the rescue team's intense work, the roadway blocked by boulders was cleared, and all thirty-two miners who had been trapped underground for thirty hours were safely rescued, with no one injured. When they rested briefly underground and ate something before emerging from the mine to meet their families, they said with emotion, "If it were in the old society, we probably would never have seen each other again in this lifetime."

　　抢救三十二条生命
    24日的四川工人日报头版登了一篇题为“抢救三十二条生命”的通讯，报道江津县集贤煤矿由于垮塌而封在矿井下的三十二个矿工被抢救出来的事迹。
    3月6日下午五点钟左右，江津县集贤煤矿井下两千公尺处，发生了严重的垮塌事故。垮塌地区约有六丈多长，巷道被垮下的岩土塞住了，有三十二个矿工被封在里面。
    垮塌事故的消息传出以后，江津专员公署、专区工会办事处、专区工业局、江津县人民委员会等单位，很快派出了十几个干部，邻近的天福煤矿和远在隆昌的义大煤矿，也派出有经验的工人和救护队赶来矿上，进行抢救。
    由四川省工业厅王工程师率领的义大煤矿救护队，赶到矿上，连水都没喝一口，就急忙下井去了。这时，江津县县长也到矿上帮助解决抢救所需要的材料。江津专署卫生科的医生，忙着整理药包和绷带，准备急救受伤的矿工。
    集贤煤矿井巷很狭窄，加上技术条件的限制，起初疏通巷道的工作进行得很缓慢。为了很快地把封在井下的矿工抢救出来，有经验的煤矿技术员和工人们提出了缩短疏通巷道时间的建议。
    经过救护队紧张的工作，巨石塞死了的巷道疏通了，被封在井下三十个钟头的三十二个矿工都安全脱了险，没有一个人受伤。当他们在井下稍事休息和吃了点东西以后，出井会见亲人们的时候，感动地说，要是在旧社会，我们这一辈子恐怕见不到面了。
