Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, March 30th: This year, agricultural cooperatives in Xiangtan Prefecture are still showing a tendency to focus solely on grain (rice) production and neglect diversified economic activities when formulating production plans. For example, in the regions along the rivers and lakes, action needs to be taken to collect fish fry, and in mountainous and hilly areas, spring tea will soon need to be picked. However, most agricultural cooperatives have not made specific arrangements for these sideline productions, risking a repeat of last year's situation where fish fry were lost to the river currents and spring tea remained unpicked on the trees. To address this, the Xiangtan Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued an urgent directive, requiring all localities to promptly arrange production comprehensively.

Historically, in Xiangtan Prefecture, the income from grain (rice) production accounts for about 46% of farmers' total income each year, while the income from cash crops and sideline occupations such as forestry and aquatic products accounts for more than half. According to a recent typical investigation conducted by the Xiangtan Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, ten agricultural cooperatives distributed in plains, mountains, and hilly areas plan to engage in 126 sideline production activities this year. Among them, 47 items can be carried out throughout the year, and 39 items require seizing the season in spring. After reasonably allocating labor, these ten cooperatives can use 34.8% of their labor days to develop sideline production this spring, in addition to completing the task of planting rice according to plan.

　　湘潭防止忽视多种经营的偏向
    据新华社长沙30日电  今年湘潭专区各地农业社在制定生产计划的时候，仍然存在单抓粮食（水稻）生产、忽视多种经营的偏向。例如沿江滨湖地区即需动手打捞鱼苗，山区和丘陵区也很快要采摘春茶，而大部分农业社对这些副业生产却没有具体安排，有重演去年鱼苗随江流去，春茶老在树上的危险。为此，中共湘潭地方委员会发出紧急指示，要求各地抓紧全面安排生产。
    湘潭专区历来每年粮食（水稻）生产的收入约占农民总收入的46％，而经济作物和山林、水产等副业收入共占半数以上。据中共湘潭地方委员会最近所作的典型调查，分布在平原、山区和丘陵区的十个农业社，今年计划搞一百二十六项副业生产。其中一年四季都可以搞的有四十七项，春季需要抓住季节搞的有三十九项。这十个社在合理调配劳动力以后，今年春季除按计划完成种植水稻的任务外，还有34.8％的劳动日可以用在发展副业生产方面。
