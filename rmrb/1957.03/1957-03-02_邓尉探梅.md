Exploring Plum Blossoms at Dengwei

Zhou Shoujuan

With the arrival of the Beginning of Spring, flower lovers and travelers are already planning their trips to view plum blossoms. Where should one go to see the plum blossoms? Chao Hill, Solitary Hill, Lingfeng Peak, or Plum Garden – these places all offer a glimpse of plum blossoms, more or less. However, the most famous spot for plum blossom viewing is Dengwei in Suzhou. Although the plum blossoms at Dengwei have gradually decreased in recent years, they still attract tourists from all over every early spring, because besides the remaining plum blossoms scattered here and there, the beautiful mountains and waters are also worth a visit.

Dengwei is located sixty li southwest of Wu County, south of Guangfu Town. Legend has it that Dengwei, a hermit of the Han Dynasty, lived in this mountain, hence the name. To the southwest is Yuan Tomb, connected to Dengwei, actually the same mountain. In the Jin Dynasty, Yu Taiyuan, the governor of Qingzhou, was buried here, hence the name. Now, this area is known as Dengwei and Yuan Tomb. In the past, people in the mountains mostly cultivated plum trees, so plum blossoms were particularly abundant, and "Exploring Plum Blossoms at Dengwei" became a popular activity in early spring. However, during the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, people referred to Yuan Tomb as the place to see plum blossoms. Gu Tieqing's "Qing Jia Lu" states: "Warm wind enters the forest, plum blossoms at Yuan Tomb bloom, extending to the Fragrant Snow Sea. Red buds and green calyxes intertwine in thousands of layers. People from the city moor their boats at Tiger Hill Bridge, carrying bedding for leisurely tours, day and night." The grand scene of plum blossom viewing at that time is evident.

Ma Jia Hill, also known as Wujia Hill, is located west of Guangfu Town. The mountain is not high, but because many plum trees are planted on it, it presents a magnificent view. In the mid-Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, Governor Song Luo inscribed the words "Fragrant Snow Sea" on the cliff and built a pavilion at a high point to serve as a place to view the plum blossoms. It is said that when Emperor Qianlong traveled south, he visited this place, and thus the name Fragrant Snow Sea became famous throughout the country. More than twenty years ago, I also joined a group of friends from Shanghai to climb this mountain. I saw a vast expanse of white, both on the mountain and below, as well as in the distance, all covered with plum blossoms. It was truly a Fragrant Snow Sea that lived up to its name. However, after the "August 13th" Anti-Japanese War, many plum trees were cut down, and the mountain people found that planting mulberry trees was more profitable than planting plum trees, so they replanted mulberry trees instead of plum trees. In 1955, I came here with colleagues from the Suzhou Garden Restoration Committee to inspect the area. We saw that the plum blossom-shaped pavilion and the half-mountain veranda were in disrepair, so we designed and restored them, and they have been completely renewed. However, since there were no plum trees on the whole mountain, I suggested that 500 trees must be replanted, but this has not yet been implemented. During the plum blossom season, although one can see the distant plum groves from the mountain, the name "Fragrant Snow Sea" feels somewhat undeserved.

The timing for plum blossom viewing must be accurate. If you go too early, the plum blossoms have not yet opened; if you go too late, the petals have already fallen. In either case, you will inevitably arrive with high expectations and leave disappointed. The ancients said: "Plum blossoms take the Awakening of Insects as their sign," which is around the beginning of the second month of the lunar calendar, just the right time. Those who plan to view plum blossoms should contact the mountain people in advance to inquire about the plum blossom situation. When the blossoms are seven or eight parts open, you can go there to appreciate the subtle charm of the faint fragrance and sparse shadows.

    邓尉探梅

    立春节届，一般爱花爱游的人们，已在安排出门去探梅了。到哪里去探梅呢？超山也好，孤山也好，灵峰也好，梅园也好，这几处梅花或多或少，都可以看看；而最著名的探梅胜处，莫如苏州的邓尉。这些年来，邓尉的梅花虽已渐渐地少了，然而每年春初，仍能吸引各地游人纷纷前去探梅，因为除了剩余的梅花散在各处，尚可一看外，那边的明山媚水，也是值得游赏一下的。
    邓尉在吴县西南六十里，在光福镇之南，相传汉代有邓尉隐居此山，故名；西南有元墓，彼此连接，实是一山，晋代有青州刺史郁泰元葬在这里，因以为名；现在这一带山以邓尉、元墓并称，山中人从前多以种梅为业，因此梅花独多，而“邓尉探梅”，也就成为初春游赏的一个节目了。但在清代道光年间，时人都以元墓看梅花为言，顾铁卿“清嘉录”有云：“暖风入林，元墓梅花吐蕊，迤逦至香雪海，红英绿萼，相间万重，郡人舣舟虎山桥畔，袱被遨游，夜以继日”。当时探梅的盛况，可见一斑。
    马驾山一名吾家山，在光福镇之西，山并不高，只因山上种着很多的梅树，洋洋大观，清代康熙中叶，巡抚宋荦，在崖壁上题了“香雪海”三字，并且在高处筑亭，以作看梅之所，据说后来乾隆下江南时，曾到此一游，于是香雪海名满海内。二十余年前，我也曾和上海的朋友们结队登临，只见山上山下，以至远处，白茫茫的一片雪白，全是梅花，真是一个不折不扣名实相副的香雪海。可是经过了“八一三”抗日战争的大劫，梅树多被砍伐；而山中人又因种梅之利不如种桑，所以补种的不是梅而是桑了。1955年，我与苏州市园林整修委员会同人来此视察，见那座梅花形的亭子和半山的轩屋，都已破败，就设计修复，早已焕然一新；但是全山没有一株梅树，我建议必须补种五百株，至今尚未实行。梅花时节，虽在山上可以望见远处的梅林，但是“香雪海”这个名称，已觉当之有愧。
    探梅的日期，必须正确，去得太早，梅花还没有开放，去得太迟，却又落英缤纷，那就不免要乘兴而来，败兴而返了。古人曾说：“梅花以惊蛰为候”，大约是在农历二月之初，正恰到好处。探梅的人们，最好能与山中人先作联系，探问梅花消息，开到七八分时，就可以前去，领略那暗香疏影的一番妙趣了。
