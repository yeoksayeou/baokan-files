We listened to Premier Zhou Enlai's "Report on Visits to Eleven Asian and European Countries" and were very excited and encouraged. Premier Zhou's visit to eleven Asian and European countries lasted eighty days and covered 100,000 miles, an unprecedented achievement for a national leader in Chinese and foreign history. His trip further strengthened the close unity of the socialist camp and the friendly cooperation between China and Asian countries. The credibility of New China in the international community has been further enhanced. All of us Chinese people are proud and honored. As for his analysis of the current international situation and China's foreign policy, it is very correct and specific, and I fully agree with it.

Now, I would like to talk about the relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and non-Party members.

The people's democratic united front led by the Chinese Communist Party played a certain role in the past people's democratic revolution, and it will continue to play its role in the future socialist revolution and construction. Therefore, how to further consolidate and expand this united front in the future is of paramount importance.

How can we make our people's democratic united front more consolidated and expanded? Of course, there are many aspects that should be worked on, and doing a good job in the relationship between the Party and non-Party members is an important aspect.

**Benefits Received by Non-Party Members**

We should first recognize that due to the Chinese Communist Party's liberation of the whole country and its correct implementation of the united front policy, our non-Party members have received countless benefits. For example:

1.  Before liberation, everyone with a conscience and integrity, seeing the corruption of the reactionary rule, the severity of the national crisis, and the dim prospects for the country and individuals, could not help but be depressed, bewildered, indignant, and passive. After liberation, everything had a solution, national construction and progress were booming, and China would surely become an extremely rich and powerful country. Everyone was relieved, completely liberated spiritually, felt happy, and even slept particularly soundly.

2.  During the reactionary rule, factional disputes, intrigues, and complicated situations were extremely common, and there were many personnel constraints. Today, everyone has only one goal, which is to serve the people wholeheartedly. Therefore, personnel matters are simple, the environment is simple, and everyone can work actively, concentrating all their time and energy on their work, and striving for achievements.

3.  In this new country and new society, the ability to cultivate and discover talents is at its greatest. Talents are never wasted or buried. In areas such as scientific research, technological innovation, and artistic creation, as long as one has a special skill, one can make the most of it, and there is no need to worry about having no opportunity to use one's abilities.

4.  In the process of continuous learning and transformation, not only has the level of professional skills been improved, but especially the level of political ideology has been raised. Everyone is happy to join the ranks of democratic progressives and contribute their strength to the great socialist cause.

5.  Due to improved treatment, stable prices, and guaranteed livelihoods, there is no need to worry about internal affairs. Many more representative people have been elected as representatives to the National and local People's Congresses or members of the National and local CPPCC, and have gained considerable political status.

6.  In the old society, whether children could become successful was the greatest concern for parents. Today, with the leadership and education of the Party, and the nurturing of the new social environment and atmosphere, the younger generation will not be degenerate, will not go astray, and everyone has education and a career. This relieves parents of one of their greatest burdens.

The above is just a brief summary of some specific facts about the various benefits that non-Party members have received under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Because everyone has received many benefits, they all express sincere and heartfelt gratitude and support for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and they all express respect and admiration for Party members and cadres, and are willing to learn from and cooperate with Party members and cadres.

**Current Problems**

However, are there no problems in the relationship between the Party and non-Party members? There are, mainly in the following aspects:

Regarding the issue of having position, power, and responsibility. This problem exists in individual agencies, schools, industrial and mining enterprises, and at all levels of leaders in charge and deputy positions. That is, some units have experienced situations where there is a position but no power, a position but nothing to do, or unclear division of labor, or even no division of labor at all. According to my years of contact and observations, the relationship between Party members and non-Party members in charge and deputy positions is very good in some departments. They can cooperate friendly, and work can be carried out. However, in some individual departments, there are still some shortcomings. According to reports, some non-Party members "can do everything, but they have to take the initiative to do it. If they don't take the initiative, they can do nothing." Some have nothing to do, or have no power when things happen. "Speaking doesn't count," "suggestions are never followed up," making them feel "embarrassed" and "bored." They have no prestige among the masses, and therefore cannot establish a sense of ownership. Some people also say that their suggestions are "said to be considered, but never happen; said to be researched, but never investigated." Party members and non-Party members are in the same position, but "some Party members know things that non-Party members are not allowed to know." Some Party member cadres often have a simple "take care" mentality, mistakenly believing that the state arranges these people to "take care of them," to play a "showcase" role. As Minister Li Weihan said, some Party members "do not respect the authority of non-Party members in working relationships and do not support them in exercising their authority."

Regarding the issue of understanding and implementing the united front policy. All democratic parties are willing to accept the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao wholeheartedly, but some Party member cadres have some problems in their understanding and implementation of united front work. According to reports, probably due to the level of political and ideological understanding, the higher the united front departments are, the fewer problems there are, or none at all. The lower the level, the more problems there are. Some Party branch cadres do not even know the nature and tasks of democratic parties. Many also reflect that the united front departments below the provincial level generally feel that there are insufficient personnel and little contact with various parties. "There is contact with the upper levels, but it is not in-depth; there is almost no contact with the middle and lower levels." "The scope of contact is not wide, and it is not easy to hear comprehensive opinions." Less contact means less consultation on handling affairs, and it is even more difficult to talk about patiently and meticulously helping others. They say that "there is little contact on weekdays, and they only come when they need something," "the united front departments do not actively look for people, do not look for people from various parties, the methods are not flexible, and they are not casual. If they are too formal, they cannot hear all kinds of inner opinions." When some Party member comrades talk to non-Party members, "on the surface it is consultation, but in reality it is instruction." Others have reported that the "forums convened by some united front departments are merely formalities, only listening to what they like to hear, only talking about other people's opinions, and not making self-criticisms," "making non-Party members afraid of making mistakes, afraid of being criticized, and afraid to express their opinions, especially opposing opinions"; "they don't speak at the meeting, but there are many opinions after the meeting." Minister Li Weihan also said: "There is insufficient understanding of the necessity and long-term nature of cooperation between democratic parties and non-Party members, which has led to wavering in united front work." "They are unwilling to consult with non-Party members on handling affairs and do not allow dissenting or opposing opinions."

Regarding the issue of friendly cooperation between Party members and non-Party members. In the early days of liberation, Party members had less contact with non-Party members and knew less about them, so it was inevitable that there would be some alienation or even estrangement. However, after six or seven years of cooperation and after a series of great social and democratic reforms, this alienation and estrangement should not be so obvious. According to our contacts, in agencies, schools, and enterprises, there are many Party members and non-Party members who are close and integrated, respect each other, and help each other, but the opposite is also not uncommon. Some Party member comrades are sometimes more rigid in their attitude, simpler in their language, and cannot talk to non-Party members, so they cannot understand others. According to reports from various parties, some Party members and non-Party members do not even live together, and even sightseeing and entertainment are carried out separately. When a few Party member comrades are talking together and a non-Party member comes in, the conversation stops immediately. Conversely, when a few non-Party members are talking together and a Party member comes in, the conversation also stops immediately. Some people describe this as "one bird entering the forest, and all the other birds silencing their voices." Some people have reported that they cannot attend relevant meetings, cannot see relevant documents, and policies and guidelines are not communicated in a timely manner, so that non-Party responsible personnel have no sense of what to do and are prone to loopholes. Others say, "The relationship between the Party and the masses now has skin and bones but no flesh. Many intellectuals want to get close to the Party but cannot find a way." "The relationship between the Party and the masses is like a high wall." When I inspected Guangdong last year, I saw that the Guangzhou Southern Daily (the official newspaper of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee) published a poem on December 7th by Xian Yuqing entitled "Inspection of Chaozhou and Meizhou" – one of the seven poems, "Party-Masses Problems": "Who made the Party and the masses separated by a high wall? Democracy has not been developed. Sitting deep in the office listening to reports, listening to only one side of the story is sad!"

Of course, the occurrence of the above problems is not due to one side alone. Non-Party members and democratic parties also have the following more or less shortcomings, such as a sense of inferiority, a guest mentality and reliance, old habits and old work styles, a low sense of ownership, weak work enthusiasm, being hesitant and unable to take charge when things happen; thinking methods are biased towards formality, subjective and one-sided; observing things often pays attention to phenomena and ignores the essence, often using the part to generalize the whole; there are also incorrect aspects in the work methods, and there are also departures from the masses and departures from reality. These are all important factors contributing to the above problems.

**Solutions**

Based on the above analysis, I believe that to do a good job in the relationship between the Party and non-Party members, we should start with the following points:

First, solve the problem from an ideological perspective.

The role and effectiveness of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front is even more significant today, displaying particularly distinct characteristics in the revolutionary history of various countries. Its scale has expanded so broadly domestically, almost encompassing all ethnic groups in the country. Its content has also developed so richly, almost encompassing all activities of non-Party members, democratic parties, and people's organizations. As Chairman Mao said: "This united front is so consolidated that it possesses a strong will and inexhaustible capacity to defeat any enemy and overcome any difficulty" (Opening speech at the Preparatory Meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference).

The Chinese Communist Party has recently proposed the call for long-term coexistence and mutual supervision with various democratic parties. As early as 1941, Chairman Mao said: "The Communist Party's principle of democratic cooperation with non-Party members is fixed and unchangeable" (Speech at the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Council). That is to say, even in the socialist era, various democratic parties still act as assistants under the leadership of the Communist Party, and supervise each other and move forward side by side. The reason why assistants are needed is that with China's large population, vast land, heavy tasks, and complicated work, it is not enough for Communist Party members to work hard without the cooperation of non-Party members. The reason why mutual supervision is needed is for common progress and to complete tasks. As far as the Communist Party is concerned, they have always advocated following the mass line and accepting supervision from the masses. Of course, they welcome supervision from the organized force of the people—the democratic parties. As far as the democratic parties are concerned, we ourselves have many shortcomings and need to accept the supervision of the Communist Party even more. This also shows that as long as there is the Communist Party, there will always be democratic parties and non-Party members. Therefore, it is completely correct and necessary for us to do a good job in the relationship between the Party and non-Party members so that we can better work together to serve the cause of socialist construction.

I would like to quote a few words from Chairman Mao's opening speech at the 8th National Congress of the Communist Party of China:

"In order to carry out great construction work, extremely arduous tasks are placed before us. Although we have more than 10 million Party members, they still account for only a very small percentage of the national population. In our various state organs and social undertakings, a large amount of work must rely on non-Party members. If we are not good at relying on the masses of the people, and if we are not good at cooperating with non-Party members, then we will not be able to do our work well."

I would also like to quote a passage from Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's political report to the 8th National Congress of the Communist Party of China:

"This requires our Party members to establish good cooperative working relationships with non-Party workers. The reason why this issue must be raised is that there are still some Communist Party members who hold a 'pure' view. They are unwilling to have non-Party members participate in the work of state organs, or they do not consult with non-Party members when things happen, and do not respect the authority of non-Party members. This view is a sectarian view. Communist Party members are always a minority among the people, so Communist Party members always have the obligation to cooperate with non-Party members. The Party must educate those Party members who are not good at cooperating with non-Party members to quickly overcome their shortcomings. This is one of the important tasks for consolidating the people's democratic united front at present."

Second, seek guarantees from the system.

Having a correct understanding ideologically can generate confidence and correct the attitude, but this is not enough. We also need to seek guarantees from the system. We can formulate various systems according to the different situations of each department, and the following basic systems are indispensable to any department:

1.  The system of criticism and self-criticism. Chairman Mao clearly instructed us long ago: "To achieve the goal of consolidating the revolutionary united front, we must adopt the method of criticism and self-criticism. ... This is a very good method. It is a good method to promote everyone to adhere to the truth and correct mistakes. It is the only correct method for all revolutionary people in the people's country to conduct self-education and self-transformation" (Closing speech at the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference). Criticism and self-criticism is the only correct method that the Communist Party has long practiced and found effective. The question is whether we can institutionalize this effective method, and whether we can use it correctly rather than distortedly, seriously rather than perfunctorily. If we can, then we will definitely be able to satisfactorily achieve long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, and we will be able to discover the shortcomings in our work in a timely manner and quickly correct them. We will be able to make the democratic parties, democratic figures, and the Communist Party "become honest friends and beneficial friends to each other."

2.  The system of consultation when things happen. Chairman Mao repeatedly told Party member comrades: "We are not a self-righteous small sect. We must learn to open the door and implement the method of democratic cooperation with non-Party members. We must learn to be good at discussing issues with others" (Speech at the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Council). Minister Li Weihan also said: "To unite, work style is also a very important issue. ... First of all, we must have a democratic work style, consult with people when handling affairs, and do not be dictatorial. ... We must be good at consulting with people who have different opinions and listening to different opinions. They may be in the minority, but we must recognize the right of the minority to speak. The opinions of the minority are not necessarily all wrong, and sometimes they are correct. Different opinions should be analyzed. If 99 points of someone's opinion are wrong, but there is still one point that is correct, it should also be accepted" (Further Consolidate and Develop the People's Democratic United Front). If Communist Party members and non-Party members can do this, and can adhere to this fine tradition, making it a regular system in agencies, schools, and enterprises, it is also one of the foundations for doing a good job in the relationship between the Party and non-Party members.

3.  The system of combining collective leadership with individual responsibility. This system has long existed in various parties, groups, agencies, and enterprises. The problem is that it has either not been strictly implemented or the regulations are incomplete. It is best to have a practical inspection to avoid one-sided phenomena in implementation. The focus of the problem is on the importance attached by the leadership, supplemented by the supervision of the masses. Being able to implement this system can largely solve the problem of having position, power, and responsibility. It can also maintain a high degree of unity and discipline in the implementation of policies and regulations, thereby greatly facilitating the improvement of the relationship between the Party and non-Party members.

Third, cultivate feelings through life and interaction.

The relationship between Party members and non-Party members is a cooperative working relationship and also a job relationship. But if there is only a job relationship and there are no feelings between them, everyone is expressionless, mechanical and rigid, that is cold and heartless. How can the relationship be good? Therefore, in addition to the job relationship between Party members and non-Party members, we must also increase and cultivate feelings from life and interaction. If they have feelings for each other, respect and love each other, encourage and help each other, this will greatly help the success of cooperative work.

How can we increase and cultivate each other's feelings from life and interaction? There are many ways: For example, in agencies, schools, industrial and mining enterprises, we should gradually set up facilities such as cultural palaces, clubs, and gymnasiums. In their spare time, Party members and non-Party members can learn to sing together, play chess together, and play ball together. But we must pay attention to the fact that when Party members and non-Party members are together, Party members should not be in one group and non-Party members in another group, with a clear boundary. Also, for example, at ordinary times, they can invite each other to their homes for tea or a simple meal, chat and laugh, and enjoy themselves. On holidays, everyone can go to the suburbs for sightseeing, climb mountains and play in the water together, sing and dance together, and play various games together. ... If we do this, we will definitely be able to gradually cultivate and increase mutual feelings. What is most feared is that the boundaries between Party members and non-Party members are too clear. They do not interact with each other on weekdays and cannot get close to each other. They cannot cultivate feelings, and it is easy to create estrangement, which will affect the relationship of cooperative work.

In short, the relationship between Party members and non-Party members is not limited to job relations, and there must be emotional ties in order to have a good relationship. This must start from daily life and interaction, and Party member cadres should put more effort into this.

Fourth, implement policies by strengthening learning, strengthening propaganda and education, and strengthening inspection work.

The united front policy is completely correct. The problem is whether it can be correctly implemented to the end during implementation. One of the important reasons why it cannot be correctly implemented to the end during implementation is that cadres at all levels do not study the policy enough and do not carry out enough propaganda and education. Therefore, we must strengthen learning and strengthen propaganda and education so that everyone fully understands the significance and importance of the policy before they can correctly implement it without hesitation and carry it out to the end. But this is not enough. We must also follow it up by strengthening inspection work. Either conduct regular inspections or conduct inspections at any time. Anyone who fails to correctly implement the policy and fails to do a good job in the relationship between the Party and non-Party members should be inspected to see who is responsible and give severe criticism. For example, the united front departments at all levels of the Communist Party, the Party committees of various agencies, schools, and industrial and mining enterprises regularly or at any time hold forums with various democratic parties, groups, and non-Party democratic figures to painstakingly and meticulously inspect the implementation of the united front work and the relationship between the Party and non-Party members. Everyone can express their opinions and make criticisms as much as possible. (It is said that since the united front work conference last year, inspections have been widely held in various places, and good results have been achieved.) The higher levels can also regularly or at any time inspect the united front work of the lower levels, and regard doing a good job in the relationship between the Party and non-Party members as one of the standards for evaluating work performance. Doing this is also a powerful guarantee for doing a good job in the relationship between the Party and non-Party members.

As mentioned above, the responsibility for doing a good job in the relationship between the Party and non-Party members seems to be focused on the Party, because the Chinese Communist Party is the leading party. Therefore, under the meaning of leading the masses, Communist Party members must unite the masses to cooperate and help the masses make progress. This will definitely do a good job in the relationship between the Party and non-Party members. I very much agree with these words of Minister Li Weihan: "Helping friends unite and make progress is the ideal and obligation of us Communists. We are very happy to see the progress of our friends, and we feel very honored if the strength of Communists is involved in the progress of our friends."

We firmly believe that although there are still some problems in the relationship between the Party and non-Party members, these problems will definitely be gradually eliminated under the continuous education and guidance of Party members by the Party and under the continuous self-education and transformation of non-Party members. That is to say, the relationship between the Party and non-Party members will definitely be gradually improved, and Party members and non-Party members will definitely be able to cooperate closely and harmoniously to jointly strive for the construction of a great, prosperous, and powerful socialist motherland.

    更加密切共产党与党外人士的关系
    张治中的发言
    我们听了周恩来总理“关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告”，非常兴奋、鼓舞。周总理这次访问亚欧十一国，历时八十日，行程十万里，这在中外历史上国家领导人所未有的创举。他此行更加强了社会主义阵营的亲密团结，更加强了中国与亚洲各国的友好合作；新中国在国际上的信誉更为提高；我们中国人民都引为光荣而自豪。至于他所谈的目前的国际形势和我国的外交政策，分析很正确而具体，我表示完全赞同。
    现在，我想谈一谈关于中国共产党与党外人士的关系问题。
    中国共产党领导的人民民主统一战线，在过去人民民主革命过程中，是起了一定的作用，而在今后社会主义革命建设中，它还将继续发挥其作用，因此，今后如何更加巩固和扩大这个统一战线，就具有头等重要的意义了。
    怎样才能使我们的人民民主统一战线更加巩固和扩大呢？当然应该努力的方面很多，而搞好党与非党的关系就是其中重要的一个方面。
    非党人士得到的好处
    我们首先应该认识到，由于中国共产党解放全国并且正确地贯彻了统一战线政策，使我们非党人士得到了无数的好处。例如：
    1、在解放前，每一个具有良心血性的人，看到反动统治的腐败，看到民族危机的深重，看到国家和个人前途的黯淡，没有不苦闷、彷徨、悲愤、消极的；而解放后一切都有办法，国家建设和进步蒸蒸日上，中国一定能变成无比富强的国家，大家都放了心，在精神上完全得到了解放，心情愉快，睡觉也觉得特别香甜。
    2、在反动统治时期，派系纷争，勾心斗角，情况复杂极了，人事牵掣也多；而今天每个人都只有一个目标，就是全心全意地为人民服务，所以人事单纯，环境单纯，大家可以积极工作，把全部时间精力都集中在工作上面，争取成绩。
    3、在这新国家新社会里，最能培养人才发现人才，从不曾糟蹋人才埋没人才，类如科学研究、技术改革、文艺创作诸方面，只要有一技之长，就可尽量施展，不患英雄无用武之地。
    4、在不断学习改造过程中，不但提高了业务水平，特别是政治思想水平，大家都欣然愉快地走入民主进步人士的行列，为伟大的社会主义事业而贡献其力量。
    5、由于待遇改善，物价稳定，生活有了保障，已无内顾之忧；许多代表性较大的人士，被选为全国及各地方人民代表大会的代表或全国及各地方政协委员，荣获了相当的政治地位。
    6、在旧社会里，儿女能否成人是最使父母操心的，而今天有了党的领导和教育，有了新的社会环境和风气的涵育，青年一代不会堕落，不会走上歧路，个个有教育、有职业，这就解除了做父母的一项最大的负担。
    以上只是略举非党人士在共产党和毛主席领导下所得到的种种好处的几个具体事实。由于大家得到许多好处，所以都对共产党和毛主席表示衷心诚挚的感谢和拥护，都对党员干部表示敬意和羡慕，都愿意向党员干部学习，和党员干部合作。
    目前存在的问题
    但是，在党与非党的关系上是不是就没有问题了呢？是有的，主要表现在以下的几个方面：
    关于有职有权有责问题。这一问题存在于个别机关、学校、工矿企业各级正副职领导人上面。就是有些单位曾经发生了有职无权、有职无事，或分工不明，甚至没有分工的。据我多年来的接触和见闻，党员与非党员正副职之间，有些部门是处得很好的，他们能友好合作，工作得到开展，但在某些个别部门中，仍然存在着一些缺点。据反映，有些非党人士“事事都可做，但要自己去抓，不去抓就可以一事不做”。有些则无事可做，或遇事无权。“说了话不顶事”，“提了意见无下文”，使他们感到“难堪”“没趣”，在群众中无威信，也就无从建立主人翁思想。有人还说，他们对你所提的意见，“说是考虑考虑，但永不来气；说是研究研究，但永远不究。”党员与非党人士在同一职位，“有些党员知道的事，非党人士则不被知道。”有些党员干部常存单纯照顾的思想，错误地认为国家安置这些人，就是照顾政策，让他们起个“摆样子”作用。诚如李维汉部长所说，有些党员“在工作关系上不尊重党外人士的职权，不支持他们行使职权”。
    关于对统战政策的认识与执行方法问题。各民主党派都心悦诚服地愿意接受共产党和毛主席的领导，但是有些党员干部对统战工作的认识与执行方法却存在着一些问题。据有人反映，大概由于政策思想水平的关系，统战部门越往上层，问题会少些，或者没有；越往下层，问题就比较多了。甚至有些党支干部，连民主党派的性质和任务都不知道。又很多反映，省委以下统战部门是普遍感到人员不足，和各方面接触少。“对上层有接触，但不深入；对中下层就几乎无接触。”“接触面不宽，听到的意见就不容易全面。”少接触，就少商量办事，更谈不到耐心、细致地帮助别人。他们说是“平日少来往，无事不登三宝殿”，“统战部门不主动找人，不多找各方面的人，方式不灵活，不随便，有正襟危坐情形，就不能听到各种内心的意见。”有些党员同志和非党人士谈话，“表面是协商，实际是指示”。还有人反映，有些统战部门召集的“座谈会流于形式，只听自己爱听的话，只讲别人的话，不作自我批评”，“使得党外人士怕犯错误，怕受批评，不敢提意见，尤其相反的意见”；“会上不讲，会后意见不少。”李维汉部长也说过：“对民主党派和党外人士合作的必要性和长期性认识不足，从而对统一战线工作发生动摇。”“不愿同党外人士商量办事，不容许不同意见和反对意见。”
    关于党员与非党人士的友好合作问题。在解放初期，党员与非党人士接触较少，了解不多，是不免有些疏远甚至隔膜的；可是经过六、七年来的合作共事，经过一系列的伟大的社会民主改革之后，这种疏远和隔膜是不应该那样分明了。据我们的接触，在机关、学校、企业中党员与非党人士亲同一体，水乳交融，互相推重，互相帮助的很多，但是相反的情形也不在少数。有些党员同志有时态度生硬些，言语简单些，和非党人士谈不拢，因此不能了解别人。据各方反映，有些党员与非党人士生活都不在一块，甚至连游览娱乐都分开进行。几位党员同志在一起谈话，一位非党人士进来了，谈话就马上停止，反之，几位党外人士在一起谈话，一位党员进来了，谈话也同样马上停止。有人形容这是“一鸟投林，众鸟压声”。有人反映，有些有关会议不能参加，有关文件看不到，政策纲领传达不及时，使非党负责人员掌握无分寸，容易出漏洞，还有说，“现在党群关系有皮骨而无肉，许多知识分子想接近党而不得其门。”“党群关系如隔一堵高墙”。去年我在广东视察时看到广州南方日报（中共广东省党报）12月7日登载署名冼玉清的“潮梅视察”七首诗之一“党群问题”：“党群谁使隔高墙，民主原来未发扬。深坐公厅听汇报，偏听偏信事堪伤！”
    当然，上述问题的发生，不是由于单方面的，在非党人士和民主党派方面也存在着以下或多或少的缺点，如自卑感，作客和依赖思想，旧习气、旧作风，主人翁情绪不高，工作积极性不强，遇事束手束脚，不敢放手负责；思想方法偏于形式，主观片面较为严重；观察事物常常注意现象而忽略本质，常以局部概括全般；在工作方法上也有不够正确之处，也有脱离群众脱离实际之处。这些，都是构成上述问题的重要因素。
    解决的办法
    基于以上分析，我认为要搞好党与非党的关系，应该从以下几点着手做起：
    第一、从思想认识上解决问题
    中国人民民主统一战线的作用和功效到今天更加显著，在世界各国革命史上显示出特别鲜明的色彩。它的规模在国内已经发展到这样广大，几乎包括了全国各民族人民；它的内容又已经发展到这样丰富，几乎包括了非党人士、民主党派与人民团体的所有活动。诚如毛主席所说：“这个统一战线是如此巩固，它具备了战胜任何敌人和克服任何困难的坚强的意志和源源不竭的能力”（中国人民政协筹备会上的开幕词）。
    中国共产党最近又提出和各民主党派长期共存互相监督的号召。毛主席早在1941年就说过：“共产党的这个同党外人士实行民主合作的原则，是固定不移的，是永远不变的”（在陕甘宁边区参议会的演说），这就是说，到了社会主义时候，各民主党派仍然在共产党领导之下充当助手，并且互相监督，并肩前进。所以需要助手，是因为以中国人口之众，土地之大，任务之重，工作之繁，只有共产党员努力而没有党外人士合作还不够。所以需要互相监督，是为了共同进步，完成任务。在共产党说，他们一向主张走群众路线，接受来自群众的监督，当然更欢迎人民群众当中有组织的队伍——民主党派的监督。在各民主党派说，我们本身有许多缺点，更需要接受共产党的监督。这也就说明了，永远有共产党，就永远有民主党派和非党人士。所以我们搞好党与非党的关系，以便更好地共事合作，来为社会主义建设事业服务，这是完全正确和必要的。
    我想引证毛主席在中共“八大”开幕词中几句话：
      “为了进行伟大的建设工作，在我们的面前，摆着极为繁重的任务。虽然我们有一千多万党员，但是在全国人口中仍然只占极少数。在我们的各个国家机关和各项社会事业中，大量的工作要依靠党外的人员来作。如果我们不善于依靠人民群众，不善于同党外的人员合作，那就无法把工作做好。”
    我还想引证中共刘少奇副主席向中共“八大”的政治报告中一段话：
      “这就要求我们的党员必须同党外工作人员建立良好的合作共事关系。这个问题之所以必须提出，是因为至今还有一部分共产党员抱着一种‘清一色’的观点，他们不愿意党外人士参加国家机关的工作，或者有事不同党外人士商量，不尊重党外人士的职权。这种观点是一种宗派主义观点。共产党员在任何时候在人民中都是少数，因此共产党员在任何时候都有义务同党外的人合作。党必须教育那些不善于同党外的人合作的党员迅速地克服自己的缺点，这是目前巩固人民民主统一战线的重要任务之一。”
    第二、从制度上求得保证
    思想上有了正确的认识，就可以产生信心，端正态度，不过这还不够，还需要从制度上求得保证。我们可以根据各个部门的不同情况制订各种制度，而以下的基本制度则是任何部门所不可缺的：
      1、批评和自我批评的制度。毛主席早就明确指示我们：“要达到巩固革命统一战线的目的，必须采取批评和自我批评的方法。……这是一个很好的方法，是推动大家坚持真理、修正错误的很好的方法，是人民国家内全体革命人民进行自我教育和自我改造的唯一正确的方法”。（中国人民政协全国委员会第二次会议闭幕词）批评和自我批评是中国共产党长期行之有效的唯一正确的方法，问题是我们能否把这个有效的方法使之制度化，使之正确地而不是歪曲地，认真地而不是敷衍地运用起来。如果能够，那我们就一定能够圆满地做到长期共存、互相监督，就能够及时发现我们工作中的缺点而迅速加以纠正，就能够使各民主党派民主人士和共产党相互间“彼此大家成为诤友、益友。”
    2、遇事协商的制度。毛主席曾反复叮咛党员同志：“我们不是一个自以为是的小宗派，我们一定要学会打开大门和党外人士实行民主合作的方法，我们一定要学会善于同别人商量问题。”（在陕甘宁边区参议会的演说）李维汉部长也说：“要团结，作风也是很重要的问题。……首先要有民主作风，与人商量办事，不要独断专行。……要善于与有不同意见的人商量，听取不同的意见。他们可能是少数，但要承认少数人的发言权。少数人的意见不一定都是错误的，有时却是正确的。对不同意见应加以分析，如果某一个人的意见九十九分都是错的，但还有一分是正确的意见，也应该接受。”（更加巩固和发展人民民主统一战线）如果共产党员和非党人士都能这样做，都能坚持这种优良传统，在机关、学校、企业中使之成为经常的制度，也是搞好党与非党关系的基础之一。
    3、集体领导与分工负责相结合的制度。这种制度在各党派、团体、机关、企业中本来早已存在，问题是或者没有严格执行，或者规定得不完整，最好来一次切实的检查，避免执行中的片面现象，而问题重心则在领导重视，再辅之以群众的监督。能够贯彻这一制度，则有职、有权、有责问题可以大部分得到解决，还可以使政策法令的推行保持高度的统一性和纪律性，因而大大有利于党与非党关系的改进。
    第三、从生活和交往上培养感情
    党员与非党人士的关系是合作共事的关系，也是职务上的关系。但如果只有职务上的关系，而彼此没有感情贯通于其间，大家都是板着脸孔，机械生硬，那就是冷酷无情，关系怎样搞得好。所以党员与非党人士之间除了职务上的关系之外，还要从生活上、交往上来增进和培养感情。彼此有了感情，相敬相爱，互励互助，这就大大有助于合作共事的成绩。
    怎样从生活上、交往上来增进和培养彼此的感情呢？办法是多种多样的：譬如在机关、学校、工矿企业中，应该逐渐设置文化宫、俱乐部、体育场一类的设备，公余之暇，党员与非党人士在一块学学唱，下下棋，打打球。但要注意党员与非党人士在一块，不要党员一块，非党人士又一块，显然有个界限。又譬如在平时，彼此可以邀请到住所吃吃茶，或者吃便饭，谈谈笑笑，其乐也融融。假日，大家到郊外游览，一同登山玩水，一同唱歌跳舞，一同做种种游戏。……如果这样做，就一定能够逐渐培养和增进相互间的感情。最怕的是党员与非党人士界限分得太清楚，平时不相往来，靠不拢，无从培养感情，且易造成隔膜，就会影响到合作共事的关系了。
    总之，党员与非党人士不仅限于职务上的关系，并且要有感情上的联系，才能完满地搞好关系，这就必须从日常生活上和交往上着手做起，而党员干部在这上面是要多尽些力量的。
    第四、从加强学习、加强宣传教育和加强检查工作上贯彻政策
    统战政策是完全正确的，问题在于执行时能否正确地贯彻到底。而执行时所以未能正确地贯彻到底，各级干部对政策学习不够、宣传教育不够是重要原因之一。所以必须加强学习，加强宣传教育，务使大家充分了解政策的意义及其重要性，才可毫无犹豫地正确执行，贯彻到底。但这还不够，还必须继之以加强检查工作。或举行定期检查，或随时检查，凡是未能正确执行政策搞好党与非党关系的，就应该实施检查，看看究竟责在谁方，予以严厉的批评。譬如中共各级统战部门、各机关、学校、工矿企业的党委定期或随时和各民主党派、团体、无党派民主人士举行座谈，不厌求详地检查统战工作执行情况，检查党与非党关系情况，大家可以尽量发表意见，提出批评。（据说从去年统战工作会议后，各地已普遍举行检查，收到很好效果）而上级对下级亦可定期或随时检查统战工作，把搞好党与非党关系作为工作考绩的标准之一。照这样做，也是搞好党与非党关系的一个有力保证。
    如上所述，搞好党与非党关系的责任，似乎着重在党的方面，就是因为中国共产党是领导的党，所以共产党员在领导群众含义之下，就要团结群众来合作，帮助群众得进步，这就一定能搞好党与非党的关系。我很赞同李维汉部长这几句话：“帮助朋友团结和进步，是我们共产党人的理想和义务，我们非常乐于看到朋友们的进步，而且朋友们的进步中如果参加有共产党人的力量，那我们是觉得非常光荣的。”
    我们坚决相信，现在党与非党关系虽尚有一些问题，但中共党员在党的不断教育指导下，非党人士在不断自我教育改造下，这一些问题一定能逐渐消除的，就是党与非党关系一定能逐渐搞好的，也就是党员与非党人士一定能逐渐亲密地、和谐地合作共事，来为建设伟大的繁荣富强的社会主义的祖国而共同努力。
