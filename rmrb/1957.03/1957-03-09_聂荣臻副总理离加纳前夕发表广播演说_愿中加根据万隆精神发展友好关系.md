Xinhua News Agency, Accra, March 8th: Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen, the Chinese special envoy, delivered a radio address on Ghana Radio here on the eve of his return to China after attending the Ghana Independence Ceremony. The full text of the speech is as follows:

Dear Ghanaian friends,

As a special envoy of the People's Republic of China, I am greatly honored to have the opportunity to be with the people of Ghana and participate in the grand celebration of the independence of the Ghanaian people upon the kind invitation of your government. On this day of national jubilation in Ghana, we bring you the warm congratulations of the 600 million Chinese people to the people of Ghana. The Chinese people wholeheartedly congratulate the Ghanaian people on their victory in winning independence, and wish the Ghanaian people new victories in the cause of safeguarding Ghana's independence and dignity, and in the cause of building their own prosperous and happy life.

The Chinese people have been following the cause of your people's struggle for independence with concern and sympathy. We are overjoyed by your victory on the road to winning national independence. The Chinese people only achieved independence eight years ago. Therefore, when we congratulate you, our hearts are closely linked to yours. We deeply know the value of freedom and independence. We have such common goals, which are to defend our hard-won independence and freedom, and to create a new happy life to get rid of the poverty and backwardness left over from the old era; we also demand to develop friendly relations with each other, and to develop friendly ties with as many countries as possible in the world; we are all determined to maintain lasting world peace so that we can engage in peaceful construction. Therefore, when we get along, we feel that we are easy to approach, easy to understand, and easy to cooperate.

In the short period since the end of World War II, many countries in Asia and Africa, which were once reduced to colonies and dependencies, have achieved independence one after another, and many enslaved nations have begun new lives one after another. The great national independence movements in Asia and Africa are profoundly changing the world.

The Asian-African Conference held in Bandung in April 1955 was the first great conference of unity and cooperation convened by Asian and African countries in history. It has become an example for all countries, regardless of differences in social systems and political systems, to live in peace with each other. It has strengthened the friendship and cooperation between Asian and African countries with 1.6 billion people, thereby strengthening peace in the Asian-African region and the world. Your government actively participated in this historically significant Bandung Conference. The Chinese government delegation is deeply honored to have been able to conduct friendly contacts with the representatives of the Ghanaian government at the Bandung Conference and establish friendship with each other. It can be seen that almost two years have passed since the meeting, but the influence of the spirit known as the Bandung Conference continues to expand. Facts have proved that the 1.6 billion Asian and African people, united together, will be a great force for peace in the world.

The Chinese government and people are eager to further develop the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Ghana, which have already begun to be established during the Bandung Conference, based on the Five Principles and the spirit of the Bandung Conference. The strengthening of friendly cooperation between China and Ghana will not only benefit the people of China and Ghana themselves, but will also be conducive to friendly cooperation between Asian and African countries and to strengthening world peace.

During our short stay in your country, we have been deeply attracted by the beauty of your mountains and rivers and the elegance of your culture, and deeply moved by the wisdom and enthusiasm of your people. Ghana has abundant resources and an excellent people. I firmly believe that the Ghanaian people, under the leadership of Prime Minister Nkrumah, will continue to achieve new achievements in consolidating their hard-won independence, seeking the development and prosperity of their country, strengthening friendly cooperation with other countries, and maintaining the cause of peace in the Asian-African region and the world.

Long live the independence of Ghana!
Long live the people of Ghana!
Long live the friendship between the Chinese people and the Ghanaian people!
Long live the unity of the Asian and African peoples!
Long live world peace!

    聂荣臻副总理离加纳前夕发表广播演说
    愿中加根据万隆精神发展友好关系
    新华社阿克拉8日电　中国特使聂荣臻副总理在这里参加了加纳独立典礼以后，在回国前夕在加纳电台发表广播演说。演说全文如下：
    亲爱的加纳朋友们：
    我作为中华人民共和国的特使，承贵国政府的盛情邀请，能够有机会同加纳人民在一起，参加加纳人民获得独立的庆祝盛典，这是我极大的荣幸。在加纳举国欢腾的日子里，我们给你们带来了六万万中国人民对加纳人民的热烈祝贺。中国人民衷心地祝贺加纳人民赢得独立的胜利，并且祝加纳人民在维护加纳的独立和尊严的事业中，在建设自己的繁荣和幸福生活的事业中，取得新的胜利。
    中国人民以关切和同情的心情注视着贵国人民争取独立的事业。我们为你们在赢取民族独立的道路上的胜利感到欢欣鼓舞。中国人民也只是在八年以前才取得独立的。因此，当我们向你们庆贺的时候，我们的心和你们的心是紧紧地连结在一起的。我们深深地知道自由和独立的可贵。我们有着这样的共同目标，这就是保卫我们得来不易的独立和自由，和创造新的幸福生活以摆脱旧时代遗留下来的贫困和落后；我们也要求发展彼此之间的友好关系，并且发展同世界上尽可能多的国家的友好联系；我们都决心要维护世界的持久和平而使我们自己得以从事和平建设。因此，我们在相处的时候，感到彼此易于接近，易于了解，易于合作。
    从第二次世界大战结束以来的短短时期中，在亚洲和非洲的大陆上，曾经沦为殖民地和附属国的许多国家一个接着一个取得了独立，许多被奴役的民族一个接着一个开始了新的生命。亚洲和非洲的伟大的民族独立运动正在深刻地改变着世界。
    1955年4月在万隆召开的亚非会议是亚非国家在历史上召开的第一次团结的大会，合作的大会。它已经成为一切国家，不管社会制度和政治制度的不同，都能够和平相处的范例。它加强了拥有十六亿人民的亚非国家之间的友谊和合作，从而加强了亚非地区和全世界的和平。贵国政府积极地参加了这一具有历史意义的万隆会议，中国政府代表能够在万隆会议上同加纳政府的代表进行友好接触并建立了彼此间的友谊深引为荣。人们可以看到，这次会议开过快两年了，但是，被称为万隆会议的精神的影响还在继续不断地扩大中。事实证明，十六亿亚非人民团结起来，将是世界上一个伟大的和平力量。
    中国政府和人民亟愿根据五项原则和万隆会议的精神，更进一步发展中、加两国在万隆会议期间已经开始建立的友好合作关系。中加两国间友好合作的加强，将不仅有利于中加两国人民自己，而且也将有利于亚非国家之间的友好合作，有利于加强世界的和平。
    在到达贵国的短短的时期当中，我们深为你们山川的美丽、文化的优美所吸引，也深为你们人民的智慧和热情所感动。加纳有着丰富的资源和优秀的人民。我深信，加纳人民将在恩克鲁玛总理的领导下，在巩固自己赢得的独立，谋求自己国家的发展和繁荣，加强同各国间的友好合作以及维护亚非地区和世界和平的事业中，不断取得新的成就。
    加纳独立万岁！
    加纳人民万岁！
    中国人民和加纳人民的友谊万岁！
    亚非人民团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
