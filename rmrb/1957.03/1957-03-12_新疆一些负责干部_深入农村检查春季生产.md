    Xinjiang - Embraced by the Tianshan Mountains, the Turpan Basin is already sowing spring wheat, and Hotan Prefecture is also about to begin spring sowing. The Ili River Valley, the Manas River Basin, and Hami are intensifying their preparations for plowing, and the pastoral areas are in the season of lambing. In order to strive for the greatest harvest in agriculture and animal husbandry this year, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region People's Committee have decided to send more than 20 responsible cadres to lead working groups deep into the prefectures and counties directly under the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture. The working groups will assist local governments in inspecting preparations for plowing, spring plowing, and increasing production and practicing economy; conduct key surveys in rural and pastoral areas, study the changes in the rural and pastoral economy and the lives of farmers and herdsmen; and, based on the characteristics of rural Xinjiang, mobilize farmers to jointly explore a set of methods for increasing production. Xinjiang's farmland mostly uses snowmelt from the mountains and groundwater for irrigation. Therefore, the working groups will also understand how to rationally utilize water sources and improve irrigation management to expand cultivated land; and understand how to improve cultivation techniques to increase yield per unit area.

    新疆一些负责干部
    深入农村检查春季生产
    本报讯　天山环抱的吐鲁番盆地已在播种春麦，和阗专区也将开始春播，伊黎河谷，玛纳斯河流域和哈密等地在加紧备耕，牧业区正是接羔的季节。为了争取今年农业和牧业最大的收获，中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会和新疆维吾尔自治区人民委员会已决定抽出二十多个负责干部率领工作组，深入到专区和伊黎哈萨克自治州直属各县。工作组将协助当地政府检查备耕、春耕和增产节约等项工作；有重点地作农村和牧区调查，研究农、牧区经济和农、牧民生活上的变化；并根据新疆农村的特点，发动农民，共同摸出一套增产的办法。新疆的农田，多系利用山上的雪水和地下水来灌溉，因此，工作组还要了解怎样合理利用水源，改进灌溉管理以扩大耕地面积；了解怎样改进耕作技术，以提高单位面积产量。
