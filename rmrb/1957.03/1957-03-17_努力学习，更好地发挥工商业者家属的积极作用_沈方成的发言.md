    Being a family member of an industrialist and businessman, I feel extremely excited and thrilled to be specially invited to attend the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, especially after participating in the enlarged Supreme State Conference and listening to Chairman Mao's cordial teachings. This was the most profound political lesson I have ever had, and the most glorious day of my life. This glory should belong to all of us family members of the industrial and commercial sector. Because my ability to attend such an important meeting embodies the Party and the state's emphasis on all of us family members of the industrial and commercial sector. First of all, I would like to thank the Party and Chairman Mao for liberating us women from thousands of years of feudal shackles, so that we, the family members of the industrial and commercial sector, have also received cultivation, education, and meticulous care.
    
    A Good Start
    Since January last year, when we, the family members of the industrial and commercial sector in Shanghai, along with our loved ones, enthusiastically and joyfully plunged into the high tide of the city's overall public-private partnership, especially after the National Women's Federation, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the China Democratic National Construction Association jointly convened the national representative meeting of family members of industrialists and businessmen and female industrialists and businessmen in March last year, which affirmed the special role and glorious responsibility of family members of industrialists and businessmen in the cause of socialist transformation, and also clarified the direction for future efforts, it greatly boosted the patriotic enthusiasm of the majority of family sisters and their enthusiasm in work and study. Over the past year, under the attention, care, and education of the Party and all relevant parties, not only has ideological awareness been improved, but also significant achievements have been made in concrete actions.
    
    First, let's talk about actively participating in learning:
    With the high tide of socialist transformation, the industrial and commercial sector has set off a wave of learning, and the family members of the industrial and commercial sector have also participated in various aspects of learning according to different conditions and on a voluntary basis. Over the past year, eleven people have participated in the political night university run by the Municipal Political Consultative Conference; last year, more than 700 people participated in the political school for the industrial and commercial sector jointly organized by the Municipal Political Consulative Conference, the China Democratic National Construction Association, and the All-China Federation of Industray and Commerce; 13,630 people participated in lectures on current affairs and policies; and even more people participated in neighborhood reading groups. Recently, the Academic Committee of the Municipal Political Consulative Conference established a women's branch and held special study classes and lectures. In the first phase of the Municipal Political School study, there were fathers and sons studying together, mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law in the same class, and 44 couples studying together, showing a new atmosphere of mutual assistance, mutual encouragement, and common progress. More and more people are asking to study, and this year it is planned that 2,000 people will participate in urban and district political schools.
    
    With the development of the situation, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association has also successively absorbed more than 200 family members as members in one year. In order to adapt to the characteristics and requirements of family work, in October last year, the Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association also established a Women's Work Committee to become a specialized institution for doing a good job in family work. The central task is to train and improve family members to become backbones in their respective families, playing a backbone, bridge, and leading role among the broad masses of family members.
    
    Secondly, through various learning and organizational training and education, many sisters have shown concrete performance in action: they not only encourage their loved ones to actively accept socialist transformation, that is, turning resistance into assistance, which has played a great role, but also strive to achieve "five goods." Among the "five goods" activists elected in Shanghai last year, there were 770 family members of the industrial and commercial sector, and many people also participated in social welfare undertakings. For example, according to statistics from three districts, among those who served as neighborhood cadres, 106 were elected as excellent cadres, and more than 1,100 people served as literacy teachers last year. There are also many examples of supporting the establishment of childcare services with financial, human, and material resources. According to statistics from 15 districts, there are 33 nurseries established by the family members of the industrial and commercial sector, 64 people participated in childcare work, and those who have the conditions have also taken up jobs, such as serving as full-time cadres of the China Democratic National Construction Association or people's teachers, and some have joined trade unions and become self-reliant workers. In addition, 1,275 backbones and activists have emerged in the study, including 42 who serve as class teachers and counselors in municipal and district political schools; 220 backbones of core work teams in various districts; 344 lecturers and study group leaders for current affairs and policy lectures; and many leaders of neighborhood reading groups. Since the China Democratic National Construction Association established the Women's Work Committee, various districts have established women's branches or women's groups. Due to the leadership of organizations at all levels, backbones and cadres are all family members themselves. They are easily close to each other in terms of ideological feelings and can study and arrange work according to the characteristics and requirements of family members. After studying the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," the sense of political responsibility and honor has been greatly improved. Everyone is earnestly responsible for doing a good job in their own organizational work. All of the above concrete facts illustrate the greatness of the Party's policy of peaceful transformation of the bourgeoisie, and also show that the family members of the bourgeoisie have made progress in learning and transformation through their own efforts, but we must not be complacent or arrogant, because this is only a beginning. Our work is far from enough, our shortcomings are still many, and our contribution to the country is too small. In order to build a socialist society, our family members should also contribute all their strength. So how can we better play our active role?
    
    Direction of Efforts
    1. Continue to strengthen learning and transform our thinking. At present, a few sisters have slackened in learning and transformation. For example, some people believe that with seven years of fixed interest, transformation can come slowly; the original plan to tighten their belts has been relaxed now that they have received fixed interest; some people think that their husbands are already state public servants and have been transformed, so there is no need to study anymore; some small and medium-sized households have some difficulties at present and have developed a feeling of discouragement and negativity; some originally wanted to seek work through study, but now see that it is impossible to achieve their goals for the time being, and are somewhat discouraged. Although the above incorrect ideas are individual, they are not acceptable. This shows that if the old ideas in our minds are not cleared, new ideas cannot be established. We need to change our positions and viewpoints, which requires a long-term and arduous ideological struggle. The main key is learning.
    
    2. Strive to achieve "five goods" and play the special role of family members of the industrial and commercial sector. Respond to the call of Sheng Pi Lao at the Shanghai Municipal Conference of Family Representatives, asking our family members to do a good job in the "five goods" themselves, and encourage our loved ones to do a good job in the "five guidelines" of the industrial and commercial sector. The five goods plus the five guidelines are "perfect" good couples. At the same time, we must be diligent and thrifty in managing our households, make careful calculations, especially the fixed interest we receive, which should not be regarded as windfall gains. We should save as much as possible, save more, buy more public bonds, support national construction, and develop the habit of diligence, thrift, and simplicity, which is beneficial to self-transformation and education of children.
    
    3. Actively participate in social welfare undertakings, such as doing more work in childcare, literacy, etc., to serve the working people.
    
    4. Backbone members should guard against arrogance and impatience, strengthen unity, closely contact the masses, expand the ranks of backbone members, and jointly make greater contributions to the socialist transformation and socialist construction of the motherland.
    
    Three Requests
    Finally, I would like to make three hopes and requests:
    
    1. Some family backbone members have too many concurrent jobs and too heavy burdens. It is hoped that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Women's Federation, the China Democratic National Construction Association, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and other relevant parties will comprehensively consider, rationally use backbone members, and make overall arrangements. Attention should also be paid to balancing and streamlining meetings, so that family sisters can appropriately balance housework, social activities, and learning; and backbone members should be strengthened in training to improve their political level and work ability.
    
    2. Among the family members of the industrial and commercial sector, there are some senior intellectuals or university graduates, or those who are proficient in foreign languages. In the old society, they had nothing to do and their talents were buried. I hope that they can be given appropriate job positions so that they can give full play to their potential strength.
    
    3. There is a lack of teaching materials for family members, especially those that are universal, popular, and meet the needs of general housewives. It is requested that the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the All-China Women's Federation and other relevant units closely cooperate to produce various teaching materials of different levels to help us learn better.
    
    Please criticize and correct the above opinions if they are appropriate.
    
    I express my heartfelt support for the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong and Vice Premier Li Fuchun. I wish you all good health!

    努力学习，更好地发挥工商业者家属的积极作用
    沈方成的发言
    我是一个工商业者家属，能够被特邀参加政协全国委员会的会议感到无比兴奋和激动，尤其是还参加了扩大的最高国务会议，听到了毛主席的亲切教导，这是一次从来没有的最深刻的政治大课，也是我有生以来最光荣的日子，这个光荣应该是属于我们全体工商界家属的。因为我能够参加这样重大的会议，也正体现了党和国家对于我们全体工商界家属的重视。首先要感谢党和毛主席把我们妇女从几千年的封建枷锁中解放了出来，使我们工商界家属，也得到了培养教育以及无微不至的关怀和照顾。
    良好的开端
    自从去年1月，我们上海的工商界家属随着自己的亲人一起敲锣打鼓，欢欣鼓舞的投入了全市全行业公私合营的高潮以来，特别是去年3月全国妇联、工商联和中国民主建国会联合召开了全国工商业者家属和女工商业者代表会议后，肯定了工商界家属在社会主义改造事业中的特殊作用和光荣责任，也明确了今后努力的方向，大大地鼓舞了广大家属姊妹们的爱国热情和在工作、学习各方面的积极性，一年来在党和各有关方面的重视关怀和教育下，不仅思想觉悟有了提高，在具体行动上也有了显著的成绩。
    首先谈谈积极参加学习的情况：
    随着社会主义改造的高潮，工商界掀起了学习的热潮，而工商界家属，也根据不同条件和自愿的原则，分别参加了各方面的学习，一年来有十一人参加了市政协举办的政治夜大学；去年有七百多人参加了由市政协、民建、工商联合办的工商界政治学校；有一万三千六百三十人参加了时事政策讲座；再有更多的人参加里弄读报组。最近市政协学委会又成立了妇女界分会，举办了专题学习班和讲座。在第一期市政校学习中有父子同学、婆媳同班，还有四十四对夫妻同学，出现了互助互勉、共求进步的新气象。要求学习的人也越来越多，今年计划有二千人要参加市区政治学校。
    随着形势的发展，中国民主建国会上海市委员会，在一年中也先后吸收了二百多个家属会员，为了适应家属工作的特点和要求，在去年10月，民建市委会还成立了妇女工作委员会，成为搞好家属工作的专门机构，中心工作是培养和提高家属会员成为家属中的骨干分子，在广大家属群众中起骨干、桥梁、带头作用。
    其次，通过各种学习和组织的培养教育，很多的姊妹们在行动上都有了具体的表现：她们不仅是鼓励亲人积极接受社会主义改造，也就是化阻力为助力，起了很大的作用，同时还努力做到“五好”，去年上海评选出来的“五好”积极分子中，工商界家属有七百七十人，参加社会公益事业的人也很多。例如担任里弄干部的根据三个区的统计，当选为优秀干部的有一百零六人，去年担任扫盲教师的也有一千一百多人，至于以财力、人力、物力来支援办托儿事业的事例也不少。根据十五个区的统计，由工商界家属集资举办的托儿所，就有三十三所，本人参加为保育工作的有六十四人，还有有条件的，也有走上了工作岗位。如担任民建会专职干部或者人民教师，也有已加入了工会，成为自食其力的劳动者。此外，在学习中还涌现了一千二百七十五个骨干和积极分子，其中担任市、区政治学校班主任、辅导员的有四十二人；各区核心工作组骨干二百二十人；时事政策讲座的讲解员、学习组组长就有三百四十四人；此外再有不少的里弄读报组的组长。民建会自从成立了妇女工作委员会，各区建立了妇女支部或是妇女小组，由于各级组织的领导，骨干和干部，都是家属会员自己，她们彼此思想感情容易接近，可以针对家属的特点和要求来研究和布置工作。在学习“长期共存，互相监督”的方针后，更大大提高了政治责任感和光荣感，大家都认真负责的要求把自己的组织工作搞好。以上这些具体事实，都说明了党对资产阶级和平改造政策的伟大，也说明了资产阶级家属经过了本身的努力，在学习和改造方面是有进步的，但是我们决不能自满，更不能骄傲，因为这仅仅是一个开端。我们的工作做得很不够，我们的缺点还很多，我们对国家的贡献太少，为了建设社会主义社会，我们家属也应该贡献出一切的力量，那么如何来更好地发挥我们的积极作用呢？
    努力的方向
    1、继续加强学习，改造思想，目前有少数姊妹在学习和改造方面有松劲现象，如有人认为定息七年，改造可以慢慢来，原来已订好计划生活紧缩了，现在拿到定息又放宽尺度了，有的认为丈夫已是国家公职人员，已经改造好了，不必再学习了，有的中小户中因为目前还有些困难，产生了灰心消极的情绪，有的本来想通过学习要求工作的，现在看看一时还不可能达到目的，有些泄气。以上这些不正确的思想，虽然是个别的，但是是要不得的，这正说明我们头脑里的旧思想不清除，新思想就不能建立，我们要改变自己的立场观点，是需要经过长期的艰苦的思想斗争，主要的关键是在于学习。
    2．努力做到“五好”，发挥工商界家属的特殊作用，响应盛丕老在上海市家属代表会议上提出的号召，要我们家属自己做好“五好”，鼓励亲人，做好工商界的“五项准则”，五好加上五项，就是“十全十美”的好夫妻。同时我们要勤俭治家，精打细算，尤其拿到的定息，不能当作落得用，应该尽可能的节约，多储蓄，多购买公债，支援国家建设，养成勤俭朴素的生活习惯，对自我改造、教育子女都是有好处的。
    3．积极参加社会公益事业，如多做托儿所、扫盲等工作等为劳动人民服务。
    4．骨干分子，要戒骄戒躁，加强团结，密切联系群众，扩大骨干分子的队伍，共同为祖国的社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业，做出更大的贡献。
    三点要求
    最后，我提出三点希望和要求：
    1．有的家属骨干分子兼职太多，负担太重，希望政协、妇联、民建、工商联等各有关方面全面考虑，骨干分子合理使用，统筹安排。并且要注意会议的平衡和精简，使家属姊妹们的家务劳动、社会活动和学习能够适当兼顾；并且对于骨干要加强培养和训练，以提高政治水平和工作能力。
    2．工商界家属中间有些高级知识分子或大学毕业，或精通外国文字，过去在旧社会中无事可做，把才能埋没了，我希望予以适当工作岗位，能够尽量发挥她们的潜在力量。
    3．对于家属的教材太缺乏，尤其是要普遍的、通俗的、结合一般家庭妇女需要的，要求政协全国委员会与全国妇联等有关单位，密切配合起来，能够搞出各种不同程度的教材，帮助我们更好的学习。
    以上意见，是否有当，请批评指正。
    对于周恩来主席以及陈叔通副主席、李富春副总理的报告，我表示衷心拥护。祝各位身体健康！
