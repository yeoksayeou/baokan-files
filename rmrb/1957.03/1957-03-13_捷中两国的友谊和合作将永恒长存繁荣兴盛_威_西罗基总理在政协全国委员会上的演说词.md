Xinhua News Agency, 12th. Czech Prime Minister Viliam Široký's speech to the Third Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference today. The full text is as follows:
    Respected delegates, dear friends:

    I am very honored to be invited to speak at your meeting, which is of particularly great significance to the People's Republic of China and has attracted worldwide attention.

    The great power of socialist thought has brought China and Czechoslovakia closer and opened a new era in the relations between the two countries.

    Please allow me to take this opportunity to convey to you – the representatives of all sectors of the people's democratic united front of the Chinese people – the warmest fraternal greetings from the people of Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak National Front, and the Czechoslovak government, and wish you success in your work. The delegation of the Czechoslovak government came to your country to promote the consolidation and deepening of Sino-Czech relations, to exchange views and experiences with you, and to learn about your great and increasingly prosperous country and people, and to draw knowledge and lessons from your work and experience in socialist construction.

    There are solid friendly ties and comprehensive genuine brotherly cooperation between the people of the People's Republic of China and the Czechoslovak Republic. Since 1949, a series of agreements have been concluded between China and Czechoslovakia, and leaders of both sides have made many important mutual visits. The people of Czechoslovakia felt very happy to be able to pay respects to Comrade Marshal Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, at the beginning of last year. A delegation of the National People's Congress also visited our country in December 1956, a few months ago.

    In the economic field, significant progress has been made in the past few years. The trade volume increased approximately fivefold during the six-year period from 1950 to 1956, and the recently signed 1957 trade agreement indicates further increases. We are infinitely proud that the Czechoslovak Republic and its people can offer their modest contributions to the Chinese people, who are enthusiastically striving to transform their country into a highly developed socialist industrial power.

    Our cultural cooperation has also flourished. Our people are constantly learning about the achievements of China's rich ancient and modern culture with excitement and joy. Since the war, more than fifty Chinese books have been translated into Czech, and our theaters have successfully staged several Chinese plays. Some Chinese films have been greatly loved by the Czechoslovak audience for their high level of ideology and persuasiveness. Just in these days, the exhibition of replicas of the Dunhuang murals, a true treasure of China's long-standing culture, has aroused great interest among our people in Czechoslovakia. The Chinese people are also constantly learning about the developing achievements of Czechoslovakia and its cultural wealth.

    One may ask: Czechoslovakia and China are thousands of miles apart, but why have the relations between China and Czechoslovakia achieved such great development in the past few years? Some say that technology has promoted the rapprochement of various nations. However, this is not the most important thing. It is not modern technology, but the great power of socialist thought that has promoted the rapprochement of nations and opened a new era in the relations between our two countries. The common struggle for socialism and for peace has promoted the rapprochement and fraternal friendship between our two peoples. This common struggle has built a solid bridge of friendship, mutual respect, and comprehensive cooperation between these distant lands.

    Although our two countries have considerable differences in size, population, cultural traditions, and economic structure; the ideas and cause of socialism and communism, the common great ideas of Marxism-Leninism, and the common struggle of proletarian internationalism against all conspiracies and provocations of international imperialist aggression forces, as well as the consistency in striving for the happiness and prosperity of the people, for peace, and for the friendship of the people of all countries, make us feel infinitely close. Therefore, friendship and love will always exist between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples, and our cooperation will bring us richer results year by year.

    China and Czechoslovakia are both following the path of the great October Revolution. Consolidating the national front will be regarded as an important task for socialism and peace.

    The profound correctness of the principles of Marxism-Leninism has once again been fully confirmed in the experiences of our two countries: on the one hand, the specific forms and methods of various countries taking the road to socialism are extremely rich and varied; on the other hand, there is a commonality in the basic aspects and issues of principle. The differences in historical traditions, current conditions, and preconditions inevitably lead to many differences between China and Czechoslovakia in socialist construction, but in the fundamental and most important aspects, our paths are common and completely consistent, because both of our countries are taking the road of the great October Socialist Revolution.

    The working classes of our two countries, under the leadership of their vanguard Communist Parties, have achieved a historically significant victory through long and arduous revolutionary struggles. It has overthrown the rule of the exploitation system for hundreds of years and established the dictatorship of the proletariat on the basis of a consolidated worker-peasant alliance. Guided by the vibrant doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, the Communist Parties of our two countries, with the working class as the core, have united the broad masses of the people in order to build a socialist society together with them. In our two countries, led by the working class and the Communist Party, the means of production have served the needs of the people, and on the basis of planned development of the national economy and cultural construction, the living standards of the people have been continuously improved. In implementing the policy of building socialism, our two countries resolutely implement the Leninist principle of equality among all nationalities, and in international relations, we resolutely implement the principle of equality among all countries and assistance to oppressed nations. Both of our countries stand firm on the front against imperialism and for peace and friendship among all countries. The National Front, led by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, is the political foundation of our people's democratic country. We have achieved positive results in socialist construction because we have relied on the alliance of workers, peasants, and intellectuals that make up the National Front, and on the unity of the people in urban and rural areas.

    For the further smooth progress of socialist construction and for the benefit of peace, we will continue to regard consolidating the National Front as our firm and important task. The National Front has deep roots in the traditions of our people and in our people's struggle for national independence. The National Front was established in the difficult years of irreconcilable struggle against Hitler's fascism. After the glorious Soviet army liberated Czechoslovakia; thoroughly guaranteeing the freedom and independence of the motherland and preventing the restoration of the poverty, exploitation, and unfreedom brought about by capitalism (the representatives of capitalism had betrayed our national interests), this was the firm will of our people, according to which the National Front developed and established itself.

    In 1948, the National Front expanded and transformed into an alliance of all urban and rural working people in Czechoslovakia, an alliance to fight for building socialism, an alliance to fight for the consolidation and unbreakable unity of the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, in the struggle against reactionary forces relying on foreign support and attempting to carry out a counter-revolutionary coup.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the National Front unites all the healthy forces of the people: various political parties, trade unions, youth leagues, and other social organizations of the working people. Of course, the existence of various political parties and their participation in the National Front has nothing in common with the union of political parties in capitalist countries. Under our people's democratic system, each member of the National Front has a unified common program, which is: the program of building socialist Czechoslovakia on the basis of comprehensively and planfully developing the national economy and culture, continuously improving the material and cultural living standards of the people, and carrying out socialist transformation of our agriculture through the development of agricultural cooperatives.

    In recent times, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the government of the National Front have been working to improve the effectiveness of the national economy and to make socialist components dominant in agriculture as well.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the government of the National Front give systematic and thorough care to ensuring the continuous development of the national economy and the growth of the country's economic strength. In the course of the development of the Czechoslovak people's democratic system, socialist components have already occupied a decisive position in industry, construction, transportation, and trade. In agricultural production, socialist components have already accounted for half of the country's cultivated land area. Our goal is to make socialist components occupy an absolute advantage in agriculture during the second five-year plan. Industrial production in 1956 increased to 2.7 times the level of capitalist Czechoslovakia. Calculated on a per capita basis, for example, steel production exceeds Japan's by two times.

    The above-mentioned achievements can only be achieved, and have already been achieved, through the planned development of the socialist economy, through the use of the rich experience of the Soviet Union and the assistance obtained from the Soviet Union, and through the extensive cooperation of countries that are carrying out socialist construction.

    In addition to these achievements, we certainly also have a series of not small shortcomings and difficulties. In recent months, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the government of the National Front have been drawing the attention of all working people to this particularly important task, which is that it is necessary to improve the effectiveness of the Czechoslovak national economy.

    The development of the national economy to a higher stage requires a fundamental improvement in its management level. In this regard, we believe that the decentralized management of the national economy is of great importance. On the one hand, it enables us to maximize the initiative of the working people and fully utilize local potentials and conditions; on the other hand, it enables the central government to strengthen its management of national plans and improve their quality. Fully guaranteeing the further strengthening and expansion of the direct participation of the working people in the management of the national economy and the state means fundamentally improving the role of trade unions in socialist construction. At the same time, increasing the role of the people's committees - the local state power and management organs - in economic and cultural construction on the basis of expanding them is a prerequisite for successfully ensuring the further improvement and expansion of the direct participation of the working people in the management of the state and the national economy.

    The mutual learning of socialist countries is our great superior condition, and the strength and unity of socialist countries are the most important pillars of the cause of progress, peace, and the freedom of the people of all countries. Dear comrades and friends!

    Countries that are building socialism have such a huge superior condition, that is, they can learn from each other's experiences, so that they can more easily find ways and methods that are suitable for their own conditions and traditions. The socialist construction of the People's Republic of China has made an extremely valuable contribution to the common treasure of all socialist countries. The far-reaching wisdom, principle, prudence, and thoroughness shown by the Chinese Communist Party and the government of the People's Republic of China in solving various difficult problems related to the large-scale transformation of the entire society; the close connection and direct cooperation established between the Communist Party and the government and the broad masses of the people; the work done by the Communist Party and the government in promoting the ancient and long-standing traditions of the people and the beautiful qualities of the people - diligence, determination, and determination to fight - for the smooth progress of socialist construction, all of this is a rich source of experience for us and other countries to learn from.

    How much wealth is contained in the ancient Chinese tradition of "loyalty, humility, and benevolence"! The Chinese Communist Party is now so resolutely developing it and enriching it with the spirit of socialism. We must also learn from what Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Modesty helps one to progress, and arrogance makes one fall behind." Our working people are studying the historical documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China with great attention, understanding the rich struggle experience of the Chinese working class, and understanding your experience in socialist construction.

    The People's Republic of China and the Communist Party of China have made great and active efforts in the past and present to further strengthen the unity of the socialist camp and to consolidate the international proletarian unity centered on the Soviet Union, and we have a high evaluation of this effort. The strength and unity of the socialist camp are the most important pillars of the cause of progress, peace, and the freedom of the people of all countries. All communists and other working people in Czechoslovakia have drawn great lessons and strength from the views held by the Communist Party of China on the international workers' movement in the People's Daily article.

    A few days ago, the plenary session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference heard the important report of Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China on the results of his visit to eleven countries in Asia and Europe. The result of this peaceful and friendly visit is that the People's Republic of China has made new and important contributions to further strengthening the unity and strength of the socialist camp and to further enhancing cooperation between socialist countries and nationally independent countries. These achievements are new and powerful proof of the thorough implementation of the peaceful policy of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, which is the general line of the foreign policy of both the People's Republic of China and the Czechoslovak Republic and all socialist countries.

    Please allow me to take this opportunity to express the indignation of the Czechoslovak government and people at the fact that the peace-loving great power - the People's Republic of China - is still deprived of its legitimate representation rights in the United Nations. This situation grossly harms the interests of the people of all Asian countries and the interests of world peace, because one of the most important world powers is thus excluded from participating in the discussion of major international issues. Czechoslovakia will continue to fight thoroughly to eliminate this harm, which is fundamentally contrary to the basic principles of the United Nations Charter and is a serious obstacle to the United Nations in fulfilling its mission.

    As for the Taiwan issue, the government of the Czechoslovak Republic most strongly condemns the aggressive policy of the United States, which is constantly strengthening its military control over this Chinese territory, strengthening its military bases on this island, in an attempt to aggravate the tension in the Taiwan region and seize Taiwan. The government of the Czechoslovak Republic wholeheartedly agrees with the view of the government of the People's Republic of China, which was recently re-expressed by Comrade Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council: Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair.

    In this era, the main driving forces in the world are two powerful global torrents. These two main progressive torrents have deep consistency and common interests on issues of principle. The continuous growth of the strength of the socialist camp accelerates the collapse of world colonial (imperial) domination and contributes to the free development of Asian and African countries liberated from this domination. On the other hand, the vigorous development of the liberation struggle of the people of Asian and African countries shakes the positions of imperialism and strengthens the front of peace and progress in the world.

    At present, the peace and happiness of all mankind and the further development of the world peace movement depend to a large extent on the friendly relations between socialist nationally independent countries and all peace-loving countries, and on the close and effective cooperation between them in the struggle against the conspiracies of aggressors, for peaceful coexistence among all countries, for easing international tensions, and for peace and friendship among the people of all countries.

    May the great and united socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, be increasingly consolidated and strengthened!

    May the friendship and fraternal cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Czechoslovak Republic last forever and flourish!

    Long live the cooperation of the people of all countries in the struggle for peace!

    捷中两国的友谊和合作将永恒长存繁荣兴盛
    威·西罗基总理在政协全国委员会上的演说词
    新华社12日讯　捷克斯洛伐克共和国总理威廉·西罗基今天在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第三次全体会议上的演说词。全文如下：尊敬的代表们，亲爱的朋友们：
    我受邀在您们的会议上讲话感到非常荣幸，这一会议对中华人民共和国具有特别重大的意义并受到全世界的关注。
    社会主义思想的伟大力量促使中捷接近并为两国的相互关系开辟了新纪元。
    请允许我借此机会向您们——中国人民的人民民主统一战线各界代表们转达捷克斯洛伐克人民、捷克斯洛伐克民族阵线和捷克斯洛伐克政府的最热烈的兄弟敬意，并祝你们工作胜利。捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团来到贵国是为了促进中捷相互关系的巩固和加深，为了同你们交换意见和经验，为了了解您们伟大的日益繁荣的国家和人民，从您们的工作和在社会主义建设当中所获得的经验中吸取知识教益。
    在中华人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国人民之间有着巩固的友好联系和全面的真正兄弟合作。1949年以来中捷两国间已经缔结了一系列的协定，双方领导人物曾进行了多次重要的相互访问。捷克斯洛伐克人民因为能够在去年年初向中华人民共和国副主席朱德元帅同志表示敬意而感到非常幸福。几个月前全国人民代表大会代表团又在1956年12月访问了我国。
    在经济方面过去几年里取得了重大的发展。从1950年到1956年的六年期间贸易额约增加了五倍，不久前签订的1957年贸易协定表明将有进一步增加。我们对于捷克斯洛伐克共和国及其人民能够向正在变自己国家为高度发展的社会主义工业大国而热情奋斗的中国人民提供自己微薄的贡献而感到无限骄傲。
    我们之间的文化合作也获得了蓬勃的发展。我国人民正以兴奋而愉快的心情在不断了解中国古代和现代丰富文化的成果。战后，有五十多种中国的书籍已经译成了捷克文，我们的剧院成功地演出了几出中国的戏剧。某些中国影片以其高度思想性和说服力受到了捷克斯洛伐克观众的很大的喜爱。正是在这几天里中国悠久的文化的真实宝藏，敦煌壁画的复制品在捷克斯洛伐克的展出引起了我国人民巨大的兴趣。中国人民同样在不断地了解捷克斯洛伐克发展中的成就及其文化的富藏。
    可以问道：捷克斯洛伐克与中国之间相距万里，而中捷两国的相互关系为什么会在过去几年里获得如此巨大的发展。有人说，技术促进了各个民族的相互接近。但是，这不是最重要的。并不是现代技术，而是社会主义思想的伟大力量促进了民族的接近，并为我们两国的相互关系开辟了新的纪元。争取社会主义和争取和平的共同斗争，促进了我们两国人民的接近和兄弟般的友谊。这个共同斗争在这段遥远的距离之间架起了一座友谊、互相敬爱和全面合作的坚固桥梁。
    虽然我们两个国家面积大小，人口数量，文化传统，经济结构都有不小的差异；但是，社会主义共产主义思想和事业，共同的马克思列宁主义伟大思想和无产阶级国际主义对于国际帝国主义侵略势力的一切阴谋和挑衅的共同斗争以及为了争取人民的幸福繁荣，为了和平和各国人民的友谊而斗争的一致性都使得我们感到无限亲切。因此，中捷人民之间将永远存在着友谊和热爱，我们的合作将为我们带来一年比一年更加丰富的成果。
    中捷两国走的都是伟大十月革命的道路。为了社会主义与和平，将把巩固民族阵线作为重要任务。
    马克思列宁主义原理深刻的正确性在我们两国的经验中又一次获得了完全的证实：一方面各国走向社会主义道路的具体形式和方法是极其丰富多采的，另一方面在基本方面和原则性问题上又具有共同性。历史传统、当前的条件和前提的不同必然使中国和捷克斯洛伐克在社会主义建设中有许多不同之点，可是在根本性的和最主要的方面我们的道路是共同的，是完全一致的，因为我们两国都是走的伟大十月社会主义革命的道路。
    我们两国工人阶级在它的先锋队共产党的领导下，经过长期的艰苦的革命斗争，获得了具有历史意义的胜利。它推翻了几百年来剥削制度的统治，在巩固的工农联盟基础上，建立了无产阶级专政。我们两国共产党在具有生命力的马克思列宁主义学说的指导下，以工人阶级为核心，团结了广大人民群众，以便同他们一起建成社会主义社会。在以工人阶级和共产党领导的我们两个国家里生产资料已服务于人民的需要，并且在有计划发展国民经济和文化建设的基础上，不断地提高着人民的生活水平。我们两国在执行建设社会主义的政策中坚决贯彻各民族平等的列宁主义原则，在国际关系中坚决地执行各国平等和帮助被压迫民族的原则。我们两国都坚守在反帝国主义和为和平与各国友谊而奋斗的战线上。以捷克斯洛伐克共产党为领导的民族阵线是我们人民民主国家的政治基础。我们在社会主义建设中之所以获得了积极的成果，因为我们依靠了民族阵线这一工人、农民和知识分子所组成的联盟，依靠了城乡人民的团结。
    为了社会主义建设的进一步顺利进行和争取和平的利益，今后我们同样将把巩固民族阵线作为自己坚决的重要任务。民族阵线的深根渊源于我国人民的传统和我国人民争取民族独立的斗争之中。民族阵线是在同希特勒法西斯进行不调和斗争的坚苦年月中建立的。光荣的苏军解放捷克斯洛伐克后；彻底保证祖国的自由和独立，阻止资本主义所带来的贫困、剥削和不自由的恢复（资本主义的代表曾背叛了我国的民族利益），这就是我国人民坚决意志，根据这种意志民族阵线发展和确立起来。
    1948年民族阵线在同依靠外国支持企图进行反革命政变的反动力量所进行的斗争中扩大了，并转变为捷克斯洛伐克全体城乡劳动人民的联盟，为建设社会主义而斗争的联盟，为以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营巩固和牢不可破的统一而斗争的同盟。
    在共产党领导下，民族阵线团结了人民的一切健康力量：各个政党、工会、青年团和劳动人民的其他社会组织，当然各个政党的存在和它们的参加民族阵线同资本主义国家政党的联合毫无共同之点。在我们人民民主制度下民族阵线中的各个成员具有一个统一的共同纲领，那就是：在全面地、有计划地发展国民经济和文化，不断地提高人民的物质和文化生活水平以及通过发展农业合作社对我国农业进行社会主义改造的基础上来建设社会主义的捷克斯洛伐克的纲领。
    最近时期，捷共中央和民族阵线政府努力于提高国民经济效果，使社会主义成份在农业方面也占优势。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会和民族阵线政府对于保证国民经济的不断发展和国家经济力量的增长给以系统而周到的关怀。在捷克斯洛伐克人民民主制度的发展过程中，社会主义成份在工业、建筑业、交通运输业和贸易中已经占有决定性的地位，在农业生产方面，社会主义成份已经占有全国耕地面积的一半，我们的目标是：使社会主义成份在第二个五年计划期间，在农业方面也占绝对优势。1956年的工业生产增至资本主义捷克斯洛伐克水平的二点七倍。按人口平均计算，例如钢的产量超过日本二倍。
    只有通过有计划发展社会主义经济，通过利用苏联的丰富经验和取得苏联的帮助以及通过正在进行社会主义建设的各国的广泛合作的途径才能够取得并且已经取得的上述这些成就。
    除了这些成就以外我们当然也有一系列不小的缺点和困难，最近几月以来捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会、民族阵线政府正把全体劳动人民的注意力引向这一特别重要的任务，这就是必须提高捷克斯洛伐克国民经济的效果。
    国民经济向更高阶段的发展要求从根本上提高它的管理水平。与此相关，我们认为国民经济的分散经营具有很大的重要性。一方面，它使我们能够最大限度地发挥劳动人民的主动性和全面利用地方的潜力和条件；另一方面，它可使中央对全国性计划的管理工作得到加强，使其质量改善。充分保证更进一步加强和扩大劳动人民直接参加国民经济的经营和国家的管理，这就意味着从根本上提高工会在社会主义建设中的作用。同时在扩大人民委员会——国家地方政权机构和管理机构——的基础上提高它们在经济和文化建设中的作用，是顺利地保证进一步提高和扩大劳动人民直接参加国家的管理和国民经济经营的先决条件。
    社会主义国家互相学习是我们巨大的优越条件，社会主义国家的力量和团结是进步事业、和平和各国人民自由的最重要的支柱。亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    建设社会主义的国家有这样一个巨大的优越的条件，那就是他们可以互相学习彼此的经验，从而能够比较容易地找到适合于它们自己的条件和传统的方式和方法。中华人民共和国的社会主义建设对所有社会主义国家的共同宝库作出了极其宝贵的贡献。中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府在解决与整个社会的大规模改造有关的各个困难问题中所表现的深远智慧，原则性，审慎的态度和彻底性；共产党和政府与广大人民所建立的密切联系和直接的配合；共产党和政府在为顺利地进行社会主义建设而发扬人民的古老而悠久传统和人民的美好品质；勤劳、坚定和斗争决心这方面所做的工作，这一切都是我们和其它国家吸取经验的丰富泉源。
    古老的中国传统“忠诚、谦虚和仁爱”包含着多么大的富藏！中国共产党今天又如此坚决地把它加以发展，并以社会主义的精神丰富了它。我们也要从毛泽东同志所说“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的话里吸取教益。我们的劳动人民正以极大的注意研究中共第八次代表大会的历史文件，了解中国工人阶级丰富的斗争经验，了解你们社会主义建设的经验。
    中华人民共和国和中国共产党过去和现在对进一步加强社会主义阵营的团结以及对巩固以苏联为中心的国际无产阶级团结作了伟大、积极的努力，对于这种努力我们有着高度的评价。社会主义阵营的力量和团结是进步事业、和平和各国人民自由的最重要的支柱。捷克斯洛伐克所有的共产党员和其他劳动人民从中国共产党在人民日报文章中对国际工人运动所持的观点吸取了巨大的教益和力量。
    几天以前，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会全体会议听取了中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一个国家的结果的重要报告。这一和平友好访问的结果是中华人民共和国对进一步加强社会主义阵营的团结和力量，对进一步增强社会主义国家和民族独立的国家之间的合作作了新的重要的贡献。这些成就是彻底执行各国不分社会制度实行和平共处这一和平政策的新的有力的证明，这个和平政策既是中华人民共和国，也是捷克斯洛伐克共和国和一切社会主义国家外交政策的总路线。
    请允许我借此机会表达捷克斯洛伐克政府和人民对这一情况的愤慨，即爱好和平的大国——中华人民共和国——直到目前仍被剥夺了在联合国中的合法代表权利。这一状况粗暴地损害着亚洲各国人民的利益和世界和平的利益，因为最重要的世界大国之一就这样被排除在参加讨论重大国际问题之外。捷克斯洛伐克将继续为消除这一损害而进行彻底的斗争，这种损害是同联合国宪章的基本原则根本矛盾的，并且是联合国实现自己任务的严重障碍。
    至于台湾问题，捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府最坚决地谴责美国的侵略政策，美国不断加强对这一中国领土的军事控制，加强自己在这一岛屿上的军事基地，以图加剧台湾地区的紧张局势，夺取台湾。捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府毫无保留地同意不久前国务院总理周恩来同志所重新表达的中华人民共和国政府的这一观点：台湾是中国的领土，台湾的解放是中国的内政。
    在目前这个时代，世界上主要的推动力量是两股强大的世界性的激流。这两股主要的进步激流在原则性的国际问题上有着深刻的一致和共同的利益。社会主义阵营力量的不断增长加速着世界殖民（帝国）主义统治的崩溃，并有助于从这种统治下解放出来的亚非国家的自由发展。另一方面，亚非各国人民解放斗争的蓬勃发展动摇着帝国主义的阵地并加强着世界上和平和进步的战线。
    目前，全人类的和平和幸福以及世界和平运动的进一步发展，在很大程度上取决于社会主义民族独立国家以及一切爱好和平国家间相互关系的友好程度，取决于它们在反对侵略者阴谋、争取各国和平共处，争取缓和国际紧张局势和争取各国人民和平与友谊斗争中合作的密切和有效的程度。
    愿以苏联为首的、伟大的、统一的社会主义阵营日益巩固和加强！
    愿中华人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国之间的友谊和兄弟般的合作永恒长存和繁荣兴盛！
    各国人民在争取和平斗争中的合作万岁！（附图片）
