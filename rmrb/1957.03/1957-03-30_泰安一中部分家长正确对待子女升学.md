　　Taian No. 1 Middle School, Some Parents Correctly Treat Their Children's Enrollment in Higher Education
    (Our report) On March 13th, Taian No. 1 Middle School in Shandong held a forum for some parents of graduating senior high school and junior high school students. During the forum, parents stated that they would definitely treat their children's enrollment and employment issues realistically, based on the needs of the motherland and their own subjective and objective conditions, and would cooperate with the school to do a good job in family education. Parent Qiao Fucheng said: "My child will be graduating from junior high school this year, and I will definitely patiently educate him. If he gets into school, he will go to school. If he doesn't get in, he can happily participate in agricultural production with me at home." Parent Zhang Jiwu said: "I am the production team leader of an agricultural production cooperative. Our cooperative needs educated people. It would be great if my son can go to higher education. If he can't, I will encourage him to return to the cooperative to be our work point recorder or an accountant."
    After the meeting, the parents also visited the school's classrooms and physics and biology laboratories.

　　泰安一中部分家长正确对待子女升学
    本报讯  3月13日，山东泰安第一中学召开了部分高中和初中应届毕业生家长座谈会。在座谈中，家长们表示：一定根据祖国需要和主客观条件，实事求是地对待自己子女的升学就业问题，并要配合学校作好家庭教育工作。家长乔福成说：“我孩子今年就要初中毕业了，我一定耐心教育他，考上学就上学，考不上学，也能高高兴兴地和我在家一块参加农业生产。”家长张继五说：“我是农业生产合作社的生产队长，我们社里正需要有文化的人，我儿子能升学很好，不能升学我就动员他回社当我们的记工员，或者当会计。”
    会后，家长们还参观了学校的教室和物理实验室、生物室等。
