    The Tale of Exploring the Way to Ma Hai
    Xu Chi
    Today, when we travel to the Qaidam Basin, we find bustling tent cities have already sprung up within the basin. In just a few years, some modern cities will also be established. It will never be the same as it once was; it can never be as desolate as it was in those days, a desolation that sent shivers down your spine.
    But this so-called "those days" is only two or three years ago: 1954-55, when the exploration teams first entered the basin.
    At that time, it was not yet possible to enter the basin from Xining. The exploration teams entered the basin from the Hexi Corridor and the southern route of the Tianshan Mountains, reaching Mang'ai. The journey was incredibly desolate: endless expanses of Gobi desert, sand dunes, devoid of any vegetation, no birds or beasts, not a trace of life.
    Mang'ai is located at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains, in the western part of this elliptical basin. At that time, they decided to build a highway, running a thousand kilometers across the basin, from Mang'ai eastward to Xining.
    At that time, their first step was to send out an exploration team to survey a route to Ma Hai. Ma Hai is directly east of Mang'ai, about three hundred kilometers away.
    Thus, a small exploration team, one truck with seven people, plunged into the desolate heart of the 200,000 square kilometer basin.
    Leading the team was Lao Cao, a technician from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Transportation. Guiding them was Isha Aji, a tall, sturdy, white-bearded Uyghur old man, wearing big boots and a black belt. In addition, there were geological personnel and a driver. There was also a radio operator, who brought a radio transceiver. The journey from Mang'ai to Ma Hai was not far, but the old man knew that no one had ever traveled this route before, or rather, those who had gone never returned.
    The exploration progress had to be reported twice a day to Deputy Director Guo, via the radio transceiver.
    After the exploration team penetrated more than eighty kilometers into the center of the basin, the radio transceiver reported that they had encountered sand dunes. The truck couldn't pass. They requested to turn back.
    Deputy Director Guo did not agree and instructed them to find a way to cross the sand dunes.
    However, after crossing the sand dunes, even larger and more treacherous sand dunes appeared ahead. They requested to turn back a second time. The director still did not allow it, instructing them to find every possible way to cross these large sand dunes.
    How did they get across? The wheels spun in the sand, the sand flew, but the truck couldn't move forward. The driver first took off his leather coat and put it under the wheels. Later, everyone put their leather coats and quilts down, and finally, they even put the camping tent down, and the truck drove over them.
    After a day and night of struggle, the radio transceiver reported: This sand dune is crossed, but there are still sand dunes ahead.
    In the tent in Mang'ai, in front of the radio station that maintained contact with Ma Hai, Deputy Director Guo himself took the headset and listened. They asked for instructions again: Could they return? He pondered for a while and once again gave the order:
   "Keep moving forward!"
    The voice from Ma Hai, amidst the crackling of the radio transceiver, said: "The truck can't pass."
   "If the truck can't pass, then the truck doesn't pass. People pass!"
    If they couldn't explore a route from Mang'ai to Ma Hai, if they couldn't even do this, then what was the point of talking about conquering and developing the Qaidam Basin? The director asked Isha Aji for his opinion. The old guide had not lost his optimistic and cheerful mood, insisting that the direction they were taking was accurate, and that they had already traveled two-thirds of the entire journey.
    The order was executed.
    A day later, the Mang'ai radio station heard the voice of "Ma Hai." The report said: Seven people set off on foot and had crossed this sand dune.
    However, ahead of them were still sand dunes, layer upon layer, sand dunes everywhere. They had no truck, no tent, and the people were exhausted. Should they continue forward, or finally, could they turn back?
    After understanding some of the situation, the director believed that they were not far from Ma Hai. Therefore, he ordered:
   "Continue moving forward!"
   "Ma Hai" expressed difficulties, but they were determined to persevere. They... suddenly, the voice of "Ma Hai" disappeared. The director panicked and handed the headset back to the duty radio operator. He called:
   "Ma Hai! Ma Hai! Ma Hai! Ma Hai!"
    The basin was silent.
    The exploration team suddenly disappeared.
   "Ma Hai! Ma Hai!" This was Mang'ai calling, but "Ma Hai" remained silent. Was the exploration team's radio transceiver broken, or had something happened?
    The next day, the third day, Mang'ai was still unable to communicate with the Ma Hai exploration team. Mang'ai became increasingly tense. Early on the fourth day, a rescue team composed of soldiers from a reconnaissance platoon, in two trucks loaded with gasoline, water, and food, led by Party Branch Secretary Du himself, followed the tracks of the exploration team's truck.
    At the same time, the Qaidam Working Committee stationed in Golmud dispatched a search team of eighty camels, searching from south to north; a geological team midway between Lenghu and Ma Hai also dispatched twenty camels to search from northeast to southwest.
    At the same time, Xining had requested the Air Force to dispatch aircraft to assist in finding the mysteriously missing exploration team.
    The fifth day...
    The sixth day...
    On the seventh day, the rescue team found the abandoned truck. In the afternoon, they finally found the exploration team. Among them, some were already unconscious, and some were weak and feeble. In these seven days, they had only eaten a few meals of thin rice soup. They could neither advance nor retreat. They had fallen into a desperate situation.
    Under the guidance of Isha Aji, who had quickly recovered, the rescue team traveled overnight, advancing only fifty kilometers through the sand dunes, and arrived at Ma Hai.
    The exploration mission was completed. From Ma Hai, the exploration team members were escorted to Lenghu, and from Lenghu to Dunhuang for recuperation. However, in Dunhuang, a strange thing was discovered.
    The technicians at the Dunhuang Post and Telecommunications Bureau inspected the exploration team's radio transceiver and found that there was nothing wrong with it.
   "What's going on?" Secretary Du felt very strange and suspicious after hearing this!
   "The machine is completely fine!" The inspector shrugged his shoulders. He said softly, "The problem may be with the radio operator."
   "But," said Secretary Du, "it has been learned that the radio operator's history is clean, and it can be confirmed that he has no political problems."
    Now, Lao Cao recalled the situation when they last spoke with Mang'ai after crossing the third sand dune. According to his recollection, he was speaking at the time, and the director had already given the order to continue moving forward. He said it was difficult but that they would persevere. At this time, the radio operator seemed to touch the radio transceiver with his left hand, touching it like this...
   "That's it, he pulled out the plug," the inspector exclaimed suddenly, "Of course they couldn't communicate!"
   "But, why would he do that?" Lao Cao asked.
    The matter was so strange: the machine was not broken, and the radio operator was definitely not a bad person, but during the call, he pulled out the plug and claimed that the machine was broken. Why? Think about it, why?
    People who have not been to the Qaidam Basin in those years may not be able to understand. The basin in those years was so desolate and silent. As long as you stayed in it for a few days, in the endless desert, as silent as if in another world, you would not be able to bear it. Your nerves could not take it, you would be dazed and confused. That's how it was, this radio operator lost his mind at that time: he pulled out the plug, not even knowing what he was doing; the machine was not broken, but he was so flustered that he said it was!
    Fragile people often ruin things! But some strong people have already spread a network of roads across the Qaidam Basin.

    马海探路记
    徐迟
    如今我们到柴达木盆地里去旅行，盆地里已出现了一些闹烘烘的帐篷城市，不消几年，还会建立起一些现代化的城市来。它就再不能像当年了；它再不能像当年那样荒凉得叫人胆战心惊了。
    但这所谓当年，距今不过两三年：1954—55年，勘探人员初进盆地的时候。
    那时，还不能从西宁进盆地，勘探人员是从河西走廊、天山南路转入盆地，到达芒崖的。一路上，这样荒凉：一望无际的戈壁、沙漠和沙包，寸草不生，没有飞禽走兽，没有任何生命的痕迹。
    芒崖在昆仑山下，在这椭圆形的盆地西部。那时，他们决定建设一条公路，贯穿盆地一千公里，从芒崖一直向东，伸到西宁。
    那时，他们第一步是要派出探路队，测出一条路线到马海去。马海在芒崖正东，约三百公里。
    于是，一支小小的探路队，一辆卡车七个人，投入了面积二十万平方公里的荒凉的盆地中心去了。
    带队的是青海省交通厅技术员老曹。带路的是高大、结实、一脸白胡子的维吾尔族老汉依沙阿吉，大靴子、黑黑的腰带。此外是地质人员、司机。还有一个报务员，他带去了无线电报话机。从芒崖到马海，路程不算远，可是老汉知道，这一路没有人走过，或者说，走过的人从没有回来过。
    探路情况要一天两次向郭副局长汇报，通过报话机。
    探路队投入盆地中心八十多公里之后，报话机里说，他们碰上了沙包。车子过不去。他们要求折返。
    郭副局长没有同意，指示他们设法翻过沙包去。
    但是，翻过沙包之后，前面出现了更大更险峻的沙包。他们第二次要求折返。局长还是没有允许，指示他们想一切办法翻过这大沙包去。
    他们是怎样翻过去的啊！车轮在沙上滚动，沙飞舞，车子却不能往前。司机首先脱下他的皮大衣，垫在轮子底下，以后大家把皮大衣、被子都垫下去，最后把宿营用的帐篷也垫下去，车子从这些上面轧了过去。
    奋战一昼夜后，无线电机里说：这个沙包是过去了，前面还是沙包。
    在芒崖的帐篷里，在和马海的报话机保持联系的无线电台面前，郭副局长自己拿过耳机听着。他们又一次请示：能否返回？他沉思了一会，又一次下命令：
   “再前进！”
    马海来的声音，在无线电机的啪啪的声音中说：“车子过不去。”
   “车过不去，车就不过去。人过去！”
    如果从芒崖到马海都不能探出一条路线来，如果连这点也办不到，那还谈什么征服和开发柴达木盆地？局长问依沙阿吉的意见。老向导并没有失去他的乐观愉快情绪，坚持他们走的方向是准确的，而且已走了全程三分之二。
    命令被执行了。
    一天后，芒崖的电台听到了“马海”的声音。那边汇报说：七个人徒步出发，已翻过了这个沙包。
    可是，在他们前面还是沙包，重重叠叠的沙包，四面都是沙包。他们没有车，没有帐篷，人都疲乏不堪。他们是继续前进，还是最后，他们可以折回来了呢？
    在了解了一些情况之后，局长认为他们离马海已经不远。因此，他命令：
   “继续前进！”
   “马海”表示困难，可是他们决心坚持下去。他们……突然间，“马海”的声音消失了。局长慌张起来，把耳机还给值班无线电员。他呼唤：
   “马海！马海！马海！马海！”
    盆地中寂寂无声。
    探路队突然失去踪迹。
   “马海！马海！”这是芒崖在呼唤，但是“马海”一声不响。是探路队的报话机坏了，还是发生了什么事情？
    第二天，第三天，芒崖始终无法和马海探路队通话。芒崖愈来愈紧张了。第四天清早，由一个侦察班的战士组成的急救队，分乘两辆卡车，满载汽油、水和粮食，由党总支杜书记亲自带队，跟踪着探路队的车迹前去。
    同时从柴达木工委驻地噶尔穆派出了由八十匹骆驼组成的搜索队，从南往北搜索；冷湖到马海的中间一个地质队也调出二十匹骆驼从东北往西南方向搜索。
    同时，西宁已请求空军出动，协助寻找那神秘地失踪了的探路队。
    第五天……
    第六天……
    第七天，急救队找到了那辆被放弃了的卡车。下午，终于找到了探路队。他们中间，有的已昏迷了，有的是微弱无力的。这七天，他们只吃了几顿稀米汤。他们前进后退都不能。他们已陷入绝境了。
    急救队在迅速恢复过来的依沙阿吉的指点下，连夜赶路，在沙包中前进不过五十公里，到了马海。
    探路的任务完成了。从马海，探路队人员被护送到冷湖，从冷湖到敦煌休养。在敦煌却发现了一件怪事。
    敦煌邮电局里的技术人员检查了探路队的那一架报话机，发现它一点儿毛病也没有。
   “这是怎么回事？”杜书记听到后，觉得太奇怪了，太可疑了！
   “机子完全没有毛病！”检查的人耸了耸肩膀。他轻声地说，“毛病，也许在报务员。”
   “但是，”杜书记说，“已经了解到这个报务员的历史，可以肯定他并没有政治问题。”
    现在，老曹回忆了他们在翻过第三个沙包之后，最后一次和芒崖通话的情形。根据他的回忆，那时他正在说话，局长已经下了继续前进的命令，他说那是困难的，但一定坚持下去。这时，报务员好像用他的左手在报话机上摸了一下，这样摸了一下……
   “那是，他把插肖拔掉了”，检查的人恍然大悟地叫起来，“当然不能通话了！”
   “但是，他为什么要这样做？”老曹问。
    事情就是这样的奇怪：机子没有坏，报话员也肯定不是坏人，可是在通话时，他把插肖拔了，又宣称这机子已经坏了。为什么呢？想想看，为什么呢？
    没有在当年到过柴达木盆地的人也许无法理解。当年的盆地是这样荒凉、死寂的，只要你在里面耽上几天，在一望无际的沙漠中，死寂得如同在另一个世界，你就会受不住。你的神经受不住了，恍恍惚惚。就是这样的，这个报务员那时失去了理智：他拔下插肖，自己都不知道干啥；机子没有坏，但他这样心慌，以至他说它坏了！
    脆弱的人常常要坏事的！但是一些坚强的人却已经把一张公路网，布满柴达木盆地了。
