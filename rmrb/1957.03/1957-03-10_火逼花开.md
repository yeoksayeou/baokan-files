    Forcing Flowers to Bloom
    Ouyang Jingru
    Not long ago, we saw the unfortunate experience of the musical child Sun Yuxi in the newspaper, and also saw a report about another musical child: four-year-old Zhang Meiling participated in the Gansu Provincial Folk Music and Dance Performance, and she can skillfully play Qin腔 tunes and folk tunes in four or five keys. So I couldn't help but think of this question: Should a preschool child who has just left the cradle be encouraged to do things that are beyond their capabilities? My personal opinion is that we should not advocate this "forcing flowers to bloom" approach.
    The advanced school system we are now implementing stipulates that children must be seven years old to go to school, which is very correct. Because teaching children to read too early or doing things beyond their intellectual and physical abilities will hinder the development and growth of children's physical and mental health. Kindergartens generally accept children over the age of four, and only do ten minutes of "homework" - drawing - every day, and most of the rest of the time is spent doing interesting games, and the reason is probably here. This means that education and training should be carried out in a planned way according to the different ages of children.
    Zhang Meiling was not born knowing how to play the huqin. General children may like music from an early age due to environmental influences, but it is difficult for them to study hard and practice diligently in a proper manner. If Zhang Meiling is like Mozart, with both talent and willingness to learn, that would be great, but if she is in an environment similar to Beethoven's: although he also has talent, but because his father, in order to achieve his own selfish desires, forced four-year-old Beethoven to sit in front of the piano for four hours at a time with beatings and scoldings, or forced him to practice the violin without rest, that would be painful for the child. Of course, the tragedy of children in the old society will not happen again, but incorrect treatment of children has not disappeared. Therefore, when new talented children are reported again, I have the same feeling as Comrade Fan Gong: joy and some worry at the same time.

    火逼花开
    欧阳敬如
    不久以前，我们在报纸上看到音乐儿童孙玉玺的不幸的遭遇，也看到关于另一个音乐儿童的报道：四岁的张美玲参加了甘肃省民间音乐舞蹈观摩会演，她能熟练地拉出四、五种调门的秦腔和民间小调。于是我不禁想起了这样一个问题：对于一个脱离襁褓不久的学龄前儿童，是否应当鼓励他做力不胜任的事情？我个人的意见是不应当提倡这种“火逼花开”的做法的。
    我们现在所实行的先进学制，规定满七周岁的儿童才能上学，这是非常正确的。因为过早教儿童识字或做超出儿童智力体力以外的事，都会妨碍儿童的身心的发育和成长。幼儿园一般都收四岁以上的儿童，而且每天只做十分钟的“功课”——画图，其余的时间多半只做有意思的游戏，其理由恐怕也就在这里。这也就是说应该有计划地按照儿童不同的年龄进行教育培养。
    张美玲不是生下来就会拉胡琴的。一般的孩子由于环境影响可能会从小喜欢音乐，但是要他们规规矩矩地勤学苦练是有困难的。假如张美玲像莫扎特一样，又有天才，学习又出于自愿，那当然是再好不过的事了，但如果她所处的是和贝多芬类似的环境：虽然也有天才，但由于他的父亲为了要达到自己自私的愿望，硬用打骂去强迫四岁的贝多芬经常在钢琴面前连坐四个钟头，或者无休息地逼他练小提琴，那对这个孩子来说就是痛苦了。当然旧社会儿童的悲剧是不会再发生了，但是，不正确的对待儿童的事实并未绝迹，因此在报道又发现新的有才能的儿童的时候，我也和凡工同志有同样的感觉：欣喜同时又有些耽忧。
