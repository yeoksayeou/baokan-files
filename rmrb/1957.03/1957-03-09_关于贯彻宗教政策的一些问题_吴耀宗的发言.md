Regarding Some Questions Concerning the Implementation of Religious Policy
Wu Yaozong's Speech

After listening to Chairman Mao's report at the Supreme State Conference and Premier Zhou's report at the CPPCC meeting, I was greatly enlightened and encouraged by both reports.

I would now like to express some opinions on the implementation of religious policy.

Achievements and Shortcomings in Implementing the Policy of Freedom of Religious Belief in Recent Years

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the government has consistently and faithfully implemented the policy of freedom of religious belief. This policy is clearly stipulated in the Common Program and the Constitution. Chairman Mao said in his speech to the Tibetan Delegation on October 8, 1952: "The Communist Party adopts a policy of protecting religion, protecting both believers and non-believers, believers of this religion and believers of other religions, respecting their beliefs. Today we adopt a policy of protecting religion, and we will continue to adopt this policy in the future." These words are even more readily quoted by us in religious circles. Chairman Mao's instructions on handling religious issues at this Supreme State Conference, although only a few words, articulated the spirit of the entire religious policy very clearly, and we in religious circles greatly admire it.

In the years after liberation, the government made great efforts to implement the religious policy and achieved great success. Taking Christianity as an example, since 1950, we have carried out the Three-Self Patriotic Movement. This movement purified the church, shortened the distance between Christians and the broad masses of the people, and began to change the face of Chinese Christianity, which had been exploited by imperialism in the past. If it were not for the environment of the New China, and without the sympathy and support of the government, this movement would not have been possible. The government has also provided much concrete assistance to the needs of the church, such as tax reductions and exemptions on real estate, and learning opportunities for clergy and believers. The legitimate religious activities of the church have been protected. Many local cadres often care about church work and regularly contact clergy. Some village cadres came to participate in the labor when the church was building a church. One cadre, in order to deal with the issue of the ownership of a tree outside a rural church, waded through chest-deep water for several miles to get to that place during a flood. Many local cadres assisted in solving the difficulties in the personal lives of clergy in various ways. It is particularly worth pointing out that the government helped the church expose some counter-revolutionary groups disguised in religious cloaks, enabling the vast number of believers to further distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, distinguish between right and wrong, and make the church more united internally. With the liberation of the Chinese people, Christianity in New China also broke away from the control of Western churches and stood up. For this historical transformation of Chinese Christianity, we have to express our heartfelt gratitude to the People's Government and the Communist Party of China.

However, in the past few years, the implementation of religious policy has not been without problems. To date, in some areas of the country, some churches have not yet resumed worship. One of the reasons why these churches have not resumed worship is that during the land reform period, local cadres were instructed by their superiors to temporarily suspend church gatherings. In order to avoid possible disputes during the land reform, the intention of this measure was good. After the land reform, many churches have resumed worship, but some local cadres, citing that they have not received instructions from their superiors, do not allow the church to resume worship. In small cities and rural churches, the problem of houses and furniture being occupied or borrowed by institutions and organizations occurs more frequently. Some occupy or borrow surplus houses and furniture of the church, and some even occupy the houses and furniture used by the church for worship, which hinders religious life and even makes it impossible to carry it out. In rural churches, the religious life of believers is sometimes interfered with. Some cadres threaten believers, not allowing them to worship; some use production as an excuse to prevent believers from participating in religious activities; some take away believers' Bibles and hymnals. One cadre in a village searched the church and believers' homes and took away 132 Bibles and hymnals, and this case has not been dealt with after several years. Some cadres not only do not respect the religious feelings of believers, but also adopt rude or insulting attitudes. Some cadres also attempt to restrict religious activities by administrative means, formulating a series of "prohibitions" for the church, such as: no offerings, no building of churches, no development of believers, etc. Sometimes church leaders are hindered from visiting or working in affiliated churches in another area.

The internal unsoundness of the church is also an important factor in the occurrence of church problems. Some churches have no organization and no leadership; some churches have been infiltrated by bad elements, counter-revolutionaries, and reactionary secret societies, and even controlled by them. The political level of the persons in charge of churches in small cities and rural areas is generally low, and what they say and do can easily cause dissatisfaction among the non-religious masses. In addition, there are some objective reasons, such as: the traces left in some places by the fact that imperialism used Christianity to carry out aggression in China, and the special circumstances caused by disasters.

Above, I mentioned some tangible issues related to the implementation of religious policy. Now, I would like to raise some intangible issues related to the implementation of religious policy. Today, there is freedom of religious belief in New China, and this is a fact. But New China is under the leadership of the Communist Party, and is guided by Marxism-Leninism, including Marxist-Leninist atheism. These two facts are not inherently in conflict, because whether they believe in Marxism-Leninism or religion, they can unite under the common aspiration of building the motherland, defending peace, and seeking happiness for mankind.

However, even so, problems will still arise. Some institutions and schools take a special view of Christians: no matter how good their work or academic performance is, their religious beliefs are often regarded as a shortcoming. For example, one hospital listed religious belief as one of the factors for backwardness when evaluating advanced workers. Some Christian students in some universities reflect that after the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, because they believe in Christianity, they are regarded as problematic people, so they dare not go to church and dare not discuss religion with Christian classmates.

The reason for this situation is the prejudice that some people hold against religion and the discrimination against religious believers caused by this prejudice. How does prejudice arise? The reasons are of course very complicated. The past relationship between Christianity and imperialism is a historical reason. Among Christians, even now, there are still some people who are influenced by imperialist ideas and counter-revolutionary elements within Christianity, and this influence may manifest itself in the life of institutions and schools at any time.

Another reason is the bias in some publications that criticize religion. In the past year or so, publishing houses in various regions have published many pamphlets criticizing religion. We have no objection to the criticism of religion; there is freedom to believe in religion, and there is also freedom not to believe in religion and to criticize religion. We do not feel uncomfortable just because someone criticizes religion. A religious believer who humbly seeks the truth is not afraid of others criticizing his religious beliefs.

What is the situation of the current publications on the criticism of religion? We must frankly say that the content of these publications has many parts that are one-sided, subjective, inconsistent with the facts, and sweeps everything away. Naturally, the first thing to do is to give a general verdict on all religions ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign: "All modern religions - Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, etc. - call on the masses to absolutely obey the oppressors, and try to sanctify the system of man exploiting man, defend it, and make it permanent." "Religion has always served the ruling class, defending class inequality and the system of exploitation." "Religion is the embodiment of outdated and reactionary ideas and concepts, and is the pillar of all decadent things." Based on the above verdict, the following conclusion is also very natural: "The resolute, active and continuous struggle against religious remnants, religious prejudices, and religious superstitions is necessary because they hinder the people from advancing to communism and hinder the development of the creativity of the masses." Are there any progressive elements among religious believers? It seems that the authors even deny this point. "'Progressive' monks - these are the part of the monks who have become smarter, and therefore more cleverly disguise their hatred of science and hatred of human development." One author, in order to negate religion, simply made an all-encompassing conclusion: "All people are atheists." In order to prove this conclusion, he used his imagination and raised the following questions: "Why do they cultivate the land and sow seeds? Can't the almighty God produce rye and wheat on uncultivated wasteland?" "Why are believers so afraid of going blind? ... According to God's will, can they see things with their hands and noses?" The conclusion seems to be: since believers do not believe that they can eat without cultivating, and do not believe that they can use their hands and noses to replace their eyes, they are all atheists.

What effect will this kind of propaganda criticizing religion have? First of all, we do not deny that there are many bad things in the organization and practice of religion (in the case of Christianity), and these bad things should be opposed by people outside the church and by people inside the church. However, we believe that the one-sided and unjust views of religion in these pamphlets will, on the one hand, make the anti-Soviet and anti-communist experts in Western Christianity speak plausibly, and on the other hand, make people who love truth and love justice in Christianity and other religions feel that they have been wronged. The authors and editors of these pamphlets do not seem to know that there is a movement of loving the motherland and loving peace in the various religions of New China; they do not seem to know that even in capitalist countries, there are peace fighters like Johnson and Wenyouchang, and many lesser-known religious figures who are fighting for justice. To obliterate these facts and obliterate these figures is to deny their position and contribution in many undertakings beneficial to mankind, and at the same time to help the forces within religion that are exploited by imperialism. Secondly, this kind of propaganda criticizing religion will make people doubt the authenticity of the policy of freedom of religious belief. According to Chairman Mao's instructions, the policy of freedom of religious belief should not only protect religion, but also respect religious beliefs. Criticizing religion is one thing, and it is another thing to make judgments without relying on facts and to adopt a rude and contemptuous attitude towards religion when criticizing religion.

Two Suggestions

Based on the above situation, I would like to offer two suggestions on how to better implement the policy of freedom of religious belief.

First, I hope that the relevant departments of the Central Committee and the People's Committees at all levels will pay more attention to religious work and conduct more, more planned, and more effective publicity and education on the policy of freedom of religious belief. This kind of publicity and education should be carried out among working cadres and also among the broad masses. One of the main contents of publicity and education should be to eliminate one-sided views on religion and advocate a realistic attitude towards religion and religious figures. While carrying out publicity and education work, we also hope that the government will strengthen the manpower of religious affairs departments, especially at the grassroots level.

Second, I hope that the relevant departments of the Central Committee will consider formulating some supplementary provisions related to the implementation of religious policy in addition to the provisions on freedom of religious belief stipulated in Article 88 of the Constitution. Many experiences have proven that the general provisions in the Constitution are not enough, because those who implement the religious policy can have many different interpretations of this provision, sometimes contradictory interpretations. The supplementary provisions cannot of course be all-encompassing, but we can stipulate the content of these supplementary provisions based on the main problems that have occurred in the past few years. The opinions of religious figures should be sought when formulating supplementary provisions. Such supplementary provisions can be of great help to the implementation of religious policy.

We know that implementing religious policy is not a unilateral matter for the government, and we in religious circles should also take responsibility. In the case of Christianity, we should further eliminate the influence of imperialist ideology, enthusiastically participate in the socialist construction of the motherland, and actively participate in the movement to defend world peace. We should thoroughly complete the task of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation, so that Chinese Christianity, which has been controlled and exploited by imperialism for more than a hundred years, will completely change its face.

We believe that further implementing religious policy and respecting religious beliefs can not only meet the religious needs of believers and stabilize their emotions, but also increase their enthusiasm for participating in socialist construction.

In the past few years, imperialism has spared no effort in its slanderous propaganda against New China. The situation of religion in New China is even more a topic they love. The most extreme propagandists among them once said: The churches in China are all closed; the pastors have all been shot. However, the fact that there is freedom of religious belief in New China has forced these propagandists to gradually change their tone. Will the problems raised above give these propagandists an excuse to spread rumors and slander again? Yes, they will be happy to see this speech, and they will try their best to use this speech as propaganda material. But what new gains can they get? Will their propaganda be more effective than in the past? I don't think so. In the past few years, the churches in New China have shown a new look in many ways. Some churches have built new churches, and some churches have ordained new pastors and bishops; church activities have increased, and the number of people attending worship has generally increased. Taking Christmas as an example, the enthusiasm of believers participating in the celebration is greater year by year. Many believers have become people's representatives and CPPCC members. In churches across the country, thousands of active elements have emerged. Every international friend who visits New China can testify to these living facts; no distortion of propaganda can change the truth of these facts.

We do not deny that there are still some problems in the implementation of religious policy. But these problems have gradually been resolved; after a certain period of time, they will definitely be completely resolved. We also do not deny that there are contradictions between religion and non-religion, between theism and atheism in New China. But these are only contradictions among the people; contradictions among the people can definitely be handled appropriately. Facts over the years have proven that many problems among the people have been resolved.

The situation of Christianity in New China does not need Western missionaries to worry about us. On the contrary, they should worry about their own churches. An American pastor, Stephen H. Fritchman, wrote in an article in September 1956: "Religious freedom in the United States is being gradually but surely deprived. It seems that there is a set of ready-made clichés, and if you don't say this set of words, you will lose the freedom to speak."

Those who attempt to maintain international tension, vainly attempt to open up gaps in the socialist camp, vainly attempt to create divisions between socialist countries and people, and vainly attempt to transform the contradictions among the people in socialist countries that can be resolved into antagonistic contradictions that cannot be resolved. Religion is one of the weapons used by imperialism in these conspiracies. Didn't Dulles use "atheistic concepts" as an excuse for his "changing the communist world" at the NATO Council meeting a few months ago? But their conspiracy is bound to fail, and their fantasy is bound to be shattered.

We Chinese Christians will not be deceived by imperialist propaganda. We love the bright and splendid New China; we love the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao who lead New China. We want to manage our churches well; we want to contribute our greatest strength to the socialist construction of the motherland; we also want to closely unite with Christians all over the world who love justice and love peace, and strive for the lofty purpose of world peace and human progress.

    关于贯彻宗教政策的一些问题
    吴耀宗的发言
    这次在最高国务会议上听了毛主席的报告，在政协会议上听了周总理的报告，这两个报告给了我很大的启发，很大的鼓励。
    我现在要就贯彻宗教政策问题，发表一点意见。
    几年来执行宗教信仰自由政策的成绩和缺点
    自从中华人民共和国成立以后，政府一贯地、忠实地执行了宗教信仰自由的政策。这个政策在共同纲领和宪法中都有明文规定。毛主席在1952年10月8日对西藏致敬团讲话时说：“共产党对宗教采取保护政策，信教的和不信教的，信这种教的或信别种教的，一律加以保护，尊重其信仰，今天对宗教采取保护政策，将来也仍然采取保护政策。”这几句话更是我们宗教界人士所乐于引用的。毛主席在这次最高国务会议上关于处理宗教问题的指示，虽然只是三言两语，却把整个宗教政策的精神阐发得非常清楚，我们宗教界人士非常佩服。
    在解放后的几年中，政府对贯彻宗教政策，作了很大的努力，也有了很大的成就。就基督教来说，从1950年起，我们进行了三自爱国运动。这个运动纯洁了教会，缩短了基督徒和广大人民间的距离，开始改变了过去被帝国主义利用的中国基督教的面貌。如果不是在新中国的环境里，如果没有政府的同情和支持，这个运动是不可能进行的。政府对教会的需要，也给予了许多具体的帮助，例如：房地产税的减免、教牧人员和信徒的学习等。教会的正当宗教活动都得到保护。许多地方干部经常关怀教会工作，经常与教牧人员联系。有的乡村干部在教会修建礼拜堂时，赶来参加劳动。有一位干部，为要处理一个乡村教会外面一棵树的所有权问题，在内涝期间，涉着齐胸的深水，走了好几里路到那个地方去。许多地方干部对教牧人员个人生活上的困难，用各种方法来协助解决。特别值得指出的是政府帮助教会揭发了一些披着宗教外衣的反革命集团，使广大信徒进一步分清敌我，辨别是非，使教会内部更加团结。随着中国人民的解放，新中国的基督教也脱离了西方教会的控制而站立起来了。为了中国基督教这个历史的转变，我们不得不对人民政府和中国共产党表示衷心的感谢。
    但是，这几年来，宗教政策的执行并不是没有问题的。到目前为止，在全国若干地区里，还有一些教会没有恢复礼拜。这些教会所以没有恢复礼拜，原因之一，就是在土地改革期间，地方干部奉到上级指示，要教会暂时停止聚会。为了避免土改时可能引起的纠纷，这个措施的用意是好的。土改后有许多教会已经恢复礼拜，但也有些地方干部借口没有奉到上级指示，不许教会恢复礼拜。在小城市和乡村教会中发生得较多的是房屋和家具被机关团体占用、借用的问题。有的是占用、借用教会多余的房屋和家具，有的甚至是占用教会用来做礼拜的房屋和家具，使宗教生活受到阻碍，甚至不能进行。在乡村教会里，信徒的宗教生活有时也受到干涉。有的干部威胁信徒，不许他们做礼拜；有的借口生产，阻止信徒参加宗教活动；有的把信徒的圣经和赞美诗拿走。有一个乡村里的干部到教会和信徒家里搜去圣经和赞美诗等一百三十二本，经过几年，这个案件还没有处理。有些干部对信徒的宗教情感不但不尊重，反而采取粗暴或侮辱的态度。也有些干部，企图用行政手段来限制宗教活动，给教会制订一系列的“禁令”，例如：不准奉献、不准修建礼拜堂、不准发展信徒等。有时教会负责人从一个地区到另一个地区的属会去探访或工作，也受到阻碍。
    教会内部的不健全也是教会问题所以发生的一个重要的因素。有的教会没有组织，没有领导；有的教会被坏分子、反革命分子、反动会道门混到里面，甚至被他们控制。小城市和乡村教会的负责人，政治水平大都比较低，他们所讲的话、所做的事，容易引起教外群众的不满。此外，还有一些客观的原因，例如：帝国主义利用基督教在中国进行侵略的事实在有些地方所留下的痕迹，灾荒所造成的特殊情况等。
    上面，我提到了与贯彻宗教政策有关的一些有形的问题。现在，我再提出一些与贯彻宗教政策有关的无形的问题。今天新中国有宗教信仰自由，这是事实。但新中国是在共产党领导之下的，是以马列主义，包括马列主义的无神论为指导思想的。这两个事实的本身并不是互相冲突的，因为不管是相信马列主义的，或是相信宗教的，他们都可以在建设祖国、保卫和平、为人类谋幸福的共同愿望下团结起来。
    但是，虽然如此，问题还是会发生的。有些机关和学校对基督徒采取一种特殊的看法：不管他们的工作或学习成绩怎样好，他们的宗教信仰往往被看作一个缺点。例如：有一个医院，在评选先进工作者时，把宗教信仰列作落后因素之一。有些高等学校的基督徒学生反映：在肃反后，因为他们信仰基督教，他们就被看作是有问题的人，因此，他们不敢去做礼拜，不敢与基督徒同学谈论宗教。
    这种情况所以产生，是由于有些人对宗教所抱的成见和这个成见所造成的对宗教信徒的歧视。成见是怎样产生的呢？原因当然是很复杂的。基督教过去同帝国主义的关系是一个历史的原因。在基督徒里面，直到现在，还有些人受了帝国主义思想和基督教内反革命分子的影响，这种影响随时都可能在机关学校的生活里表现出来。
    还有一个原因，就是一些关于批判宗教的出版物的偏向。在过去一年多当中，各地区的出版社出版了不少的批判宗教的小册。我们对批判宗教这一件事，没有意见；信仰宗教的有自由，不信宗教的、批判宗教的也有自由。我们也不是因为有人批判宗教，便感到不舒服。一个虚心追求真理的宗教信仰者，是不怕别人批判他的宗教信仰的。
    目前关于批判宗教的出版物，是怎样一种情况呢？我们不能不坦白地说：这些出版物的内容，有不少的部分是片面的、主观的、不符合事实的、一笔抹煞的。很自然地，开宗明义的第一件事就是要对古今中外的一切宗教给予一个总的宣判：“所有现代宗教——基督、犹太、伊斯兰教、佛教等等，都叫人民群众绝对服从压迫者，都力图把人剥削人的制度神圣化，为它辩解，使它永久存在。”“宗教是一向替统治阶级服务，捍卫阶级不平等和剥削制度的。”“宗教是陈腐的反动思想和观念的体现者，是一切腐朽东西的支柱。”根据上述的宣判，下面的结论也是很自然的：“坚绝（决）的，积极不断的反对宗教残余，宗教偏见，宗教迷信的斗争是必要的，因为它们阻碍着人民向共产主义前进，它们阻碍着人民群众创造力的发展。”是不是在宗教信仰者里面也有进步的成分呢？似乎作者们连这一点也否认了。“‘进步的’僧侣——这是僧侣中变得更聪明的、因而也就是更巧妙地掩饰他们仇视科学和仇视人类发展的那一部分。”有一位作者为要否定宗教，索性作出一个全面的结论：“所有的人都是无神论者。”为要证明这个结论，他就运用他的想像，提出下面这些问题：“为什么他们要耕地和播种呢？难道说万能的神不能在未开垦的荒地上生出黑麦和小麦吗？”“为什么信徒们那样害怕瞎了眼睛呢？……难道根据神的意志，他们就能用手和鼻子来看东西吗？”结论似乎是：信徒们既不相信可以不耕而食，不相信可以用手和鼻子来代替眼睛，他们就都是无神论者。
    这一类批判宗教的宣传，将会产生什么效果呢？首先，我们并不否认在宗教的组织和实践方面（就基督教来说）有许多坏的东西，这些坏的东西，教外的人反对，教内的人也应当反对。但是，我们认为这些小册子对宗教的片面的、不公正的看法，一方面将会使西方基督教里面反苏反共的专家们振振有词，另一方面也会使基督教和其他宗教里面热爱真理、热爱正义的人士，感到他们受了冤屈。这些小册子的作者和编者们似乎不晓得在新中国的各个宗教里面，都有一个爱祖国、爱和平的运动；他们似乎不晓得：甚至在资本主义国家里面，还有像约翰逊、文幼章这些和平战士，和许多为正义而斗争的，不大知名的宗教界人士。抹煞这些事实，抹煞这些人物，就是否认他们在许多对人类有益的事业中的地位和贡献，同时也助长了在宗教里面被帝国主义利用的力量。其次，这一类批判宗教的宣传，将会使人怀疑宗教信仰自由政策的真实性。根据毛主席的指示，宗教信仰自由政策不但要保护宗教，也要尊重宗教信仰。批判宗教是一件事，在批判宗教时，不根据事实来作判断，对宗教采取粗暴轻蔑的态度，这是另一件事。
            两点意见
    根据以上所说的情况，对如何更好地贯彻宗教信仰自由政策的问题，我愿意提出两点意见。
    第一、希望中央有关部门和各级人民委员会对宗教工作更加重视，对宗教信仰自由政策作更多的、更有计划的、更有效的宣传教育。这种宣传教育应当在工作干部中进行，也应当在广大群众中进行。宣传教育的主要内容之一，应当是消除对宗教的片面的看法，提倡对宗教及宗教界人士采取实事求是的态度。在进行宣传教育工作的同时，我们也希望政府加强宗教事务部门的人力，特别在基层干部方面。
    第二、希望中央有关部门在宪法第88条所规定的宗教信仰自由的条文以外，考虑制订一些与贯彻宗教政策有关的补充条文。许多经验证明：宪法上概括的条文是不够的，因为执行宗教政策的人对这个条文可以有许多不同的解释，有时是互相矛盾的解释。补充的条文当然不可能是包罗万象的，但我们可以根据这几年来所发生的主要问题，来规定这些补充条文的内容。制定补充条文时，应当征求宗教界人士的意见。这样的补充条文对宗教政策的贯彻可以有很大的帮助。
    我们知道：贯彻宗教政策不是政府片面的事，我们宗教界人士也应当负起责任。就基督教来说，我们应当进一步肃清帝国主义思想的影响，热烈地参加祖国的社会主义建设，积极地参加保卫世界和平运动。我们应当彻底地完成自治、自养、自传的任务，使过去一百多年中被帝国主义控制利用的中国基督教完全改变它的面貌。
    我们认为进一步贯彻宗教政策，尊重宗教信仰，不但可以满足信徒们在宗教生活上的要求，安定他们的情绪，也可以提高他们对参加社会主义建设的积极性。
    在过去几年中，帝国主义对新中国的污蔑宣传是无所不用其极的。新中国宗教的情况，更是他们所喜爱的一个题目。他们当中最极端的宣传家们曾经说：中国的教会都关门了；牧师们都被枪毙了。但是，新中国宗教信仰自由的事实已经使这些宣传家们不得不逐渐改变他们的口气。上面所提出的那些问题，是不是又会使这些宣传家们得到造谣诽谤的借口呢？是的，他们看到这篇发言，一定会感到高兴，他们一定会尽量利用这篇发言来作宣传的资料。但是，他们又能得到什么新的收获呢？他们的宣传是不是比过去更有效力呢？我以为不会是这样的。这几年来新中国的教会在许多方面呈现了新生的气象。有的教会建筑了新的礼拜堂，有的教会按立了新的牧师和主教；教会的活动增加了，做礼拜的人数也一般地增加了。就以圣诞节而论，信徒参加庆祝的情况，一年比一年热烈。许多信徒做了人民代表和政协委员。在全国各地的教会里面，涌现了成千成百的积极分子。每一个到新中国来访问的国际友人，都可以为这些活生生的事实作见证；任何歪曲宣传都不能改变这些事实的真相。
      我们并不否认在宗教政策的执行上，还存在着一些问题。但这些问题，已经逐渐获得解决；经过一定的时间，必定能够完全解决。我们也不否认：在新中国里面，在宗教与非宗教之间，在有神与无神之间，存在着矛盾。但这只是人民内部的矛盾；人民内部的矛盾是一定可以得到适当的处理的。几年来的事实证明，许多人民内部的问题都已经得到解决。
    新中国基督教的情况不需要西方的宣教家们替我们担心。相反的，他们应当担心的，却是他们自己的教会。一位美国牧师斯梯芬·H·弗里区曼在1956年9月的一篇文章里，这样写道：“美国的宗教自由正在逐步地但是肯定地遭到剥夺。仿佛有一套准备好了的陈腔滥调，你若不说这一套话，就会失去说话的自由。”
    那些企图维持国际紧张局势的人们，妄想在社会主义阵营中打开缺口，妄想在社会主义国家和人民当中制造分裂，妄想使社会主义国家中可以解决的人民内部的矛盾转变为不能解决的对抗性的矛盾。宗教就是帝国主义在这些阴谋中所用的一种武器。杜勒斯在几个月前举行的北大西洋公约组织理事会上，不就是用“无神论观念”作为他的“改变共产党世界”的一个借口吗？但是，他们的阴谋是一定要失败的，他们的幻想是一定要破灭的。
　　我们中国基督徒不会受帝国主义宣传的迷惑。我们热爱灿烂光明的新中国；我们热爱领导新中国的中国共产党和毛主席。我们要把我们的教会管理得很好；我们要为祖国的社会主义建设贡献我们最大的力量；我们也要与全世界爱好正义、爱好和平的基督徒紧密地团结起来，为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力。（附图片）
