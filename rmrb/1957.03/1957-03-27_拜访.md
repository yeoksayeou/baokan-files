　　A Visit
　　The port scenery shone outside Sun Bin's window. Loading and unloading machinery clamored on the wharf. Our guest sat on the soft sofa. Our guest was a sailor from North Africa. The ship was berthed in the harbor, and would sail at three o'clock tomorrow afternoon. As if with new emotion, his eyes signaled to us: "Such punctual loading and unloading work, not even Glasgow in England or Antwerp in Belgium can match. I am already very familiar with this place." He flicked his cigarette ash and gently sipped his tea, as if returning to that world over there, a wave of sadness immediately washing over his face. "Sitting here with you, like brothers, how can we not be happy? But over there, we can only walk with our heads down." But then he said: "I hope that one day, you will visit our port as guests. Algiers will also break free from its chains." The port scenery shone outside the window. Loading and unloading machinery clamored on the wharf. Our guest sat on the soft sofa, his eyes flashing with fire.

　　拜访
　　孙滨窗外闪耀着港口的风光，装卸机械在码头上喧哗，松软的沙发上坐着我们的客人，我们的客人是一位从北非来的船员。轮船停泊在港口，明天午后三点就要开航，仿佛又有了新的感慨，他的眼睛向我们示意：“这样准时的装卸工作，英国的格拉斯哥，比利时的
  安特卫普也赶不上，这里我已经很熟了。”他抖了抖烟灰，轻轻地喝了一口茶，好像又回到那边的世界，脸上登时袭来一阵忧伤。“我们坐在这里，兄弟一般的怎不幸福，可是在我们那边，只好把头低着走路。”但是，他接着又说：“希望有那么一天，去我们的港口作客，阿尔及尔也就要挣脱身上的锁链。”窗外闪耀着港口的风光，装卸机械在码头上喧哗，松软的沙发上坐着我们的客人，他的眼睛里闪着火光。
