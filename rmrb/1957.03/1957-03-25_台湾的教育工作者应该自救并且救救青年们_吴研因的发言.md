　　Taiwan's Educators Should Save Themselves and Save the Youth
　　Wu Yan's Speech
　　I wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou Enlai's "Report on Visits to Eleven Asian and European Countries" regarding "foreign policy" and, for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, the call that "all Chinese with blood should unite in the spirit of patriotism and family to resist foreign aggression and shatter the schemes of American imperialism."
　　I am an educator who worked in educational administration for more than 20 years under the Kuomintang rule. I know many Chinese educators who went from the mainland to Taiwan, and I have contacted local Taiwanese Chinese educators several times. I know that most of these people are patriotic people with blood. Now, I would like to say a few words to these educators.
　　Premier Zhou told us: "Taiwan is Chinese territory. The residents of Taiwan, including all Kuomintang military and government personnel, are Chinese. The liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair and a problem that the Chinese people can solve themselves." I think these words are undeniable truths. Who can say that Taiwan is not Chinese territory? Who can say that the residents of Taiwan, including educators, are not Chinese? Who can say that the liberation of Taiwan is not an internal affair of China? I think even those so-called "free China elements," who admire the United States and want to rely on the United States for the rest of their lives, cannot deny this truth, right? Patriotic and wise Chinese educators in Taiwan should understand this truth even more.
　　Since everyone understands this truth, why are those so-called "free China elements" willing to be under the wing of American imperialism, failing to recognize that American imperialism is "attempting to turn Taiwan into an American territory like Honolulu" and thus "attempting to enslave China?" Haven't you seen that Taiwan's industrial and mining enterprises are gradually being transferred to the hands of American bosses, and that American surplus goods, including "toilet paper," are flooding the Taiwanese market, acting as bloodsuckers of Taiwanese compatriots? Haven't you seen American tycoons commanding their hooligans and secret agents, arrogantly controlling Taiwan's military and political affairs, American warmongers driving planes and warships surrounding the entire Taiwan, and American soldiers tyrannically trampling on Taiwanese men and women? Haven't you seen obscene and thieving American movies and publications, the decadent American lifestyle of luxury and extravagance, and the nonsensical and shamelessly fabricated Voice of America, corrupting Taiwanese Chinese compatriots and poisoning the minds of China's next generation of teenagers? Today's Taiwan has almost become an American territory, today's Chinese people in Taiwan have almost become American slaves, and today's Chinese youth in Taiwan are falling into the poisonous atmosphere of American imperialist decadent thought. It is truly shameful, painful, and tragic!
　　Of course, there are some shameless and heartless people who want to rely on American imperialism no matter what. Even if American imperialism does not sincerely support them, and even if it arranges so-called "free China elements" and "Taiwan independence elements" to replace them one after another, they are like drowning people grasping at rotten straw, fantasizing that the rotten straw will save their lives. But the Chinese educators in Taiwan will not be as shameless and heartless as them, watching Taiwan being enslaved by American imperialism, especially watching the Chinese youth in Taiwan being poisoned by American imperialism, without feeling ashamed, painful, and tragic. But if you don't take action, use action to save yourselves and save the youth, what's the use of just feeling ashamed, painful, and tragic?
　　Of course, Taiwanese educators do not have the strength and it is not easy to take action. But your team is not small, and your students are even more numerous. If you unite to do some patriotic and anti-imperialist movements similar to the "May Fourth Movement," it is still possible. If even this is not possible, then you have mouths and hearts. Can't you use your mouths and hearts to enlighten everyone among your team and students, so that everyone can spread Premier Zhou's call to "unite and resist foreign aggression" and imprint it in their hearts? Don't think that your strength is too small and that doing so will not help; in fact, the success of the Xinhai Revolution and the victory of the Liberation War both started from doing this. If you can do this, sooner or later there will be a day when water flows and canals form, and when the melon is ripe, it will drop. Even if the effect is not great, at least you can emerge from the mud without being stained, save yourselves, especially save the youth, save one if you can, so that everyone can see the poison of American imperialism and not be confused. That is you making contributions to the motherland and our next generation.
　　The People's Republic of China after liberation is completely independent and autonomous. There are no foreign soldiers on its territory, few foreign goods are seen in the market, gangsters and bandits have almost disappeared, land and water transportation is orderly, and various constructions are making rapid progress. A strong and rich beautiful scene can be expected soon. You see, in just a few years, domestic affairs have been so well-managed, and the international status has been raised so high. Isn't this a stark contrast to Taiwan, which is under the control of American imperialism? Just in terms of education, education on the mainland is also gradually developing and improving. Universal primary education is no longer a problem, with more than 63 million children enrolled in schools. Secondary schools and universities have also developed three to five times more than before liberation; and the intellectual, moral, and physical education of young people has developed in an all-round way, and the academic style is also very different from that before liberation. What about Taiwan? Isn't the education cause gradually shrinking, the lives of teachers very difficult, and the thoughts of young people deeply poisoned, getting worse every day?
　　I was an educator in the old China. As early as before the liberation of the mainland, I was very dissatisfied with the American imperialism's conspiracy to enslave China under the pretext of anti-communism and anti-Sovietism. Of course, I also felt that the Chiang Kai-shek regime that fled to Taiwan had no hope, so on the eve of liberation, although I also felt that I was an "unknown" after liberation, I did not run to Taiwan or any overseas place. But the mainland was liberated, and the Communist Party did not blame the past and still allowed me to engage in education. In the seven or eight years since liberation, I have seen everything in the new China, especially the hope that education has been popularized and improved, and I cannot help but admire the Communist Party, and I cannot help but love our new China very excitedly; I feel that being an educator in such a new China is also something to be very proud of. Like me, Chinese educators who did not leave the mainland, even reactionaries who participated in organizations such as the CC, have also received a new path and can still engage in education. Like me, they also feel that the motherland has a very bright future, admire the Communist Party, and feel proud to be educators in the new China. I wonder what Chinese educators from the mainland to Taiwan and local Taiwanese Chinese educators think about this situation? Do you want to be a proud educator in the new China too? If you do, please stand with us educators on the mainland, "unite in the spirit of patriotism and family," save yourselves, and exert your potential to educate young people with your mouths and hearts to be anti-imperialist and patriotic, at least not be confused by American imperialism, so as to promote the peaceful liberation of Taiwan! We educators in the new China have been called "human soul engineers" who shape the next generation of young people. The team is very strong, the status is getting higher and higher, and the future is infinitely bright. Everyone is opening their eyes and looking at you, reaching out to you, hoping and welcoming you to one day join our team, and join us in enjoying lofty honor and striving for a better future.

　　台湾的教育工作者应该自救并且救救青年们
　　吴研因的发言
    我衷心拥护政协主席周恩来总理“关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告”中所提到的“外交政策”和为了和平解放台湾
  “一切有血性的中国人，都应该本着爱国一家的精神，团结起来，一致对外，粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋”的号召。
    我是个教育工作者，曾在国民党统治时期担任过二十多年的教育行政工作，认识不少从大陆到台湾去的中国教育工作者，也和台湾本地的中国教育工作者接洽过好几次，知道这些人大多数都是有血性的爱国之士。现在，我来对这些教育工作者们说几句话。
    周总理对我们说：“台湾是中国的领土。台湾的居民，包括一切国民党军政人员在内，都是中国人。解放台湾是中国的内政，是中国人自己能够解决的问题。”我想这些话是无法辩驳的真理。谁能说台湾不是中国的领土呢？谁能说台湾的居民连教育工作者在内不是中国人呢？谁能说解放台湾不是中国的内政问题呢？我想即使最崇美亲美想终身依靠美国过活的那些所谓“自由中国的分子”等等，也不能否认这个真理的吧？在台湾有血性的、爱国的、明智的中国教育工作者，应该更加明白这个真理。
    大家既然明白了这个真理，为什么那些所谓“自由中国的分子”之类还甘心处在美帝国主义的卵翼之下，认不清美帝国主义“企图把台湾变成像檀香山一样的美国属地”从而“企图奴役中国的真面目”呢？难道没有看到台湾的工矿企业逐渐转移到美国大老板手里去，美国的剩余物资，连“手纸”在内，充斥于台湾市场，在做台湾同胞的吸血鬼吗？难道没有看到美国的大亨们指挥着它们的流氓、特务，趾高气扬地控制着台湾的军事、政治，美国的好战分子驾驶着飞机、军舰包围着整个台湾，美国的丘八们横凶霸道地蹂躏着台湾的男女同胞吗？难道没有看到诲淫、诲盗越货的美国电影和刊物，金迷纸醉、腐化透顶的美国生活方式，胡说八道、无耻造谣的美国之音，在腐蚀台湾的中国同胞并且毒害中国下一代青少年的思想吗？今日之台湾，几乎成了美国之属地，今日台湾的中国人民，几乎成了美国的奴婢，今日台湾的中国青少年，正陷落在美帝腐朽思想的恶毒气氛里，真是可耻、可痛、可悲之极啦！
    当然，有一些不知羞耻、没有心肝的人，是无论如何也想把美帝国主义做靠山的。即使美帝国主义并不真心支持他们，甚至另行布置所谓“自由中国的分子”和“台湾独立的分子”，准备倒了一个、扶上一个，他们也像落在水里的垂死的人一样，还要把美国当烂稻草抓着，幻想烂稻草会救他们的命。但是台湾的中国教育工作者却不会像他们一样没廉耻、没心肝，眼看台湾被美帝国主义奴役，尤其是台湾的中国青少年被美帝国主义毒害，而不觉得可耻、可痛、可悲的。但是如果不行动起来，用行动来自救并且救救青少年们，徒然感到可耻、可痛、可悲，又有什么用呢？
    台湾的教育工作者，当然没有实力，不容易行动起来的。但是你们的队伍不算小，你们的学生更众多，如果团结起来做一些类于“五四运动”的爱国反帝运动，还是可能的。如果连这样做也不可能，那么你们是有口有心的，难道不能在你们的队伍和学生之间，用你们的口和心启发大家，使大家对周总理“团结起来，一致对外”的号召，口口相传，心心相印吗？你们不要以为你们的力量太小，这样做也无补于事；其实辛亥革命的成功，解放战争的胜利，都是从这样做开始的。你们能这样做，早晚会有水到渠成，瓜熟蒂落的一天。即使功效不大，但是你们至少能出污泥而不染，自救，尤其是救救青少年，救一个是一个，使大家看清美帝国主义的毒害而不致迷罔，那就是你们为祖国为我们的下一代立功了。
    大陆解放后的中华人民共和国是完全独立、自主的。领土上没有一个外国兵，市场上很少看到外国货，流氓土匪几乎绝迹，水陆交通秩序井然，而且各种建设，都在一日千里地突飞猛进，强而且富的美景是计日可待的。你们看，短短的几年，内政做到这样修明，国际地位提得这么高，不是和处在美帝国主义控制下的台湾，适成鲜明的对比吗？专就教育而论，大陆的教育，也在逐步发展和改进，普及小学教育已经不成问题，入学儿童达到了六千三百多万，中学、大学也比解放前发展了三、五倍；而且青少年的智德体各育全面发展，学风也和解放前大不相同了。台湾怎么样？不是教育事业日渐萎缩，教师生活十分困难，青年思想深受毒害，真是一天不如一天吗？
    我本是旧中国的教育工作者，早在大陆解放之前，就对美帝国主义借口反共反苏、实际想奴役中国的阴谋十分不满，当然也觉得逃往台湾的蒋介石政权更毫无希望，所以临解放的前夕，虽然也感到解放后自己是个“未知数”，却没有跑到台湾或者海外任何地方去。但是大陆解放了，共产党不咎既往，仍让我从事教育工作。解放七、八年来，看到新中国的一切，尤其是看到教育也有了普及、提高的希望了，不由我不佩服共产党，不由我不十分兴奋地爱护我们的新中国；我觉得在这样一个新中国做一个教育工作者，也是可以十分自豪的。和我一样没有离开大陆的中国教育工作者，即使参加过CC等一些组织的反动分子，也得到了自新之路，仍能从事教育工作，也和我一样觉得祖国前途十分美好，佩服共产党，感到做新中国教育工作者的足以自豪。不知从大陆往台湾和台湾本地的中国教育工作者对这样的情况作何感想？想不想也做一个自豪的新中国教育工作者？如果想的话，请你们和我们在大陆的教育工作者站在一起，“本着爱国一家的精神，团结起来”，自救，并且发挥你们的潜力，用口用心教育青少年反帝爱国，至少不受美帝的迷罔，以促使台湾的和平解放吧！我们新中国教育工作者，已被号称塑造下一代青少年的“人类灵魂工程师”了，队伍非常壮大，地位日渐崇高，前途无限美好。大家都正在睁眼望着你们，伸手对着你们，希望并且欢迎你们终有一天合并到我们的队伍中来，和我们一道，享受崇高的荣誉，争取更美好的前途。（附图片）
