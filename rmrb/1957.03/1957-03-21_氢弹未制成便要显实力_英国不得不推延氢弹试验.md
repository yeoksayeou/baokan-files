　　Wanting to Show Strength Before the Hydrogen Bomb is Made
　　Britain Has to Postpone Hydrogen Bomb Test
    Xinhua News Agency, 20th - Bermuda News: Britain's efforts to test its first hydrogen bomb before the Anglo-American summit have failed. It is said that the British hydrogen bomb test on Christmas Island will probably be postponed to early April.
    The news said that British leaders had hoped to conduct the test before the opening of the meeting in order to show the world, especially the Americans, that Britain is still a major power.
    According to London's "Daily Express" on the 18th, the hydrogen bomb made in Britain has not yet been completed. It said that British scientists are "desperately rushing to make" five hydrogen bombs for testing.

　  氢弹未制成便要显实力
　　英国不得不推延氢弹试验
    新华社20日讯　百慕大消息：英国争取在英美首脑会谈以前试验英国的第一枚氢弹的努力已经失败。据说，英国在圣诞岛的氢弹试验大概要推迟到4月初。
    消息说，英国领袖们曾经希望在会谈开幕前就已经进行试验，以便向全世界，特别是向美国人表明，英国仍然是一个大国。
    据伦敦“每日快报”18日透露，英国制造的氢弹还没有完成。它说，英国科学家们正在“拚命赶制”五枚氢弹，用来进行试验。
