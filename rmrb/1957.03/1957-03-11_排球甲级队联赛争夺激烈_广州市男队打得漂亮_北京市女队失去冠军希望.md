Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th: The competition in the 1957 National Volleyball Grade A League will become increasingly intense. As of the 9th, the nineteen men's and women's volleyball teams have played a total of forty-six games, equivalent to half of the entire schedule.

In the men's group, the "August 1st" team and the Beijing team both have five wins and zero losses, while the Guangzhou team has six wins and zero losses. In the women's group, the "August 1st" team and the Shenyang Institute of Physical Education team have won all their matches. The former has won four games, and the latter has won three games.

The Beijing women's team, which was originally considered capable of competing with the "August 1st" women's team for the championship, was defeated by the Shenyang Institute of Physical Education women's team with a score of two to three after five rounds of intense competition on the evening of the 7th. On the 9th, the Beijing women's team played against the "August 1st" women's team and lost again with a score of one to three. It seems that they have no hope of contending for the championship (the Beijing women's team has played three games, winning only one).

The Beijing men's team has fierce spikes, excellent passing, tight blocking, and many tactical changes. Since the start of the competition, they have won every game with an absolute advantage of three to zero. Although the "August 1st" men's team has won continuously, they have not yet played up to their original level. In the five games, only the match against the Chongqing men's team was won with a score of three to zero, and in other games, they lost one or two sets to their opponents. In the match between the "August 1st" men's team and the Nanjing Military Region team, they even lost the first two sets with a score of one to two. In the match against the Wuhan Institute of Physical Education men's team, the champion of last year's Grade B League, they also lost the first set. The Guangzhou men's team adopts brave and diverse attacks in every game, and their serves and spikes are fierce and accurate, making them play quite beautifully. This team was the sixth-place finisher in last year's Grade A League, but this year it has become a threat to the "August 1st" men's team and the Beijing men's team in the fight for the championship.

Currently, the Wuhan Institute of Physical Education men's team, the champion of last year's Grade B League, is ranked fourth in the men's team standings. They have successively defeated the Shenyang Institute of Physical Education team, the Chengdu Institute of Physical Education team, the Nanjing Military Region team, and the Chongqing team, achieving a record of four wins and two losses in six games. The Public Security Army men's team and the Shanghai Institute of Physical Education men's team have each won three games out of six. The only men's team composed of industrial workers, the Coal Mine Sports Association men's team, the runner-up of last year's Grade B League, has two wins and four losses in six games.

In the women's group, the Shanghai Institute of Physical Education team, the Chengdu Institute of Physical Education team, and the Chongqing team each have one win and two losses. The Wuhan Institute of Physical Education team has lost all three of its games.

    排球甲级队联赛争夺激烈
    广州市男队打得漂亮　北京市女队失去冠军希望
    新华社广州10日电　1957年全国排球甲级队联赛的比赛将日趋紧张，到9日止十九个男、女排球队共比赛了四十六场，相当于全部赛程的一半。
    在男子组中，“八一”队和北京市队都是五战五胜，广州市队已经六战六胜。在女子组中，“八一”队和沈阳体育学院队连战皆胜。前者胜四场，后者胜三场。
    原来被认为能同“八一”女子队争夺冠军的北京市女子队，7日晚和沈阳体育学院女子队比赛时，经过五局的激烈争夺后，都以二比三被沈阳体育学院女子队打败。9日，北京市女子队同“八一”女子队比赛时，又以一比三失败。看来她们已无争夺冠军的希望（北京市女子队已赛三场，仅胜一场）。
    北京市男子队扣球凶狠，他们的传球相当出色，加上拦网严密，战术变化又多，出赛以来每场都以三比零的绝对优势获胜。“八一”男子队虽然连战连胜，但还没打出原有水平。在五场比赛中，仅对重庆市男子队的一场是以三比零获胜的，其他各场都被对方胜了一局或两局。“八一”男子队对南京部队队的那场比赛，竟以一比二先负；对去年乙级队冠军——武汉体育学院男子队的比赛，也曾经先败一局。广州市男子队每战都采取勇猛而多样的进攻，他们发球扣球又狠又准，打得相当漂亮。这个队是去年甲级队的第六名，今年却成为“八一”男子队和北京市男子队争夺冠军的一个威胁。
    目前，男子队积分列第四位的是去年乙级队的冠军——武汉体育学院男子队。他们曾经先后打败了沈阳体育学院队、成都体育学院队、南京部队队和重庆市队，取得六战四胜的成绩。公安军男子队和上海体育学院男子队都是各赛六场胜三场。唯一的一个由产业工人组成的煤矿体育协会男子队——去年乙级队的亚军是六战二胜。
    在女子组中，目前上海体育学院队、成都体育学院队和重庆市队都是三战一胜。武汉体育学院队三战都败。
