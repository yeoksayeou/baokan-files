Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 2nd: The head of the Hungarian Ministry of Construction Industry said at a press conference on February 28th that although Hungary experienced the October events last year, it still built more housing than in any previous year. Many homes that began construction last year will be completed this year.

The head said that construction has begun on three thousand ordinary residences and ten thousand miner residences this year. The construction industry will build nearly twenty thousand residences this year, which is almost double the number built in previous years. In addition, approximately twenty thousand residences are being built by individual producers.

However, the production of building materials is not yet able to fully meet the needs, so there may be temporary material supply shortages in the future.

The head concluded by saying that in order to reduce construction costs, the staff of the leading organs of the construction industry departments has been reduced by two-thirds. Other expenses are also being cut.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 2nd: The Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government announced decisions on housing and pension issues on February 28th.

The decision on housing stipulates that some residences nationalized in 1945 and houses vacated due to the streamlining of government agencies will be allocated as housing. If employees of enterprises and agencies want to repair houses originally used by the agencies that have been allocated to them, the government will provide loans.

The decision on pension issues stipulates that former pensioners who are still working can receive pensions according to the new pension standards in the future after they leave their jobs.

In addition, the government has recommended that the Presidium of the People's Republic improve the method of subsidies for mothers with many children.

    匈牙利今年将建造四万套住宅
    政府决定将部分国有房屋拨充民用
    新华社布达佩斯2日电  匈牙利建筑工业部负责人2月28日在记者招待会上说，匈牙利虽然去年发生了十月事件，但是还建筑了比过去任何一年都多的住宅。从去年开始建造的许多住宅都将在今年完工。
    负责人说，今年开始建造的有三千套普通住宅和一万套矿工住宅。建筑工业今年总共将建造好近两万套住宅，比以前几乎每年所建造的数字多一倍。此外，还约有两万套住宅正在由个体生产者建造中。
    但是，目前建筑材料的生产还不能够完全满足需要，所以今后可能会发生暂时的材料供应紧张的现象。
    负责人最后说，为了降低建筑成本，建筑工业部门领导机关的工作人员已经裁减了三分之二。其他方面的开支也在削减中。
    新华社布达佩斯2日电  匈牙利工农革命政府2月28日公布了有关住宅和养老金等问题的决定。
    关于住宅问题的决定规定，把1945年收归国有的部分住宅和由于紧缩机关编制后多出来的房子拨作住房。企业和机关的职工如果要修理分配给他们的原机关用的房屋，政府将给予贷款。
    关于养老金问题的决定规定，现在还在工作的以前的养老金领取者，将来在脱离工作以后可以按照新的养老金标准领取养老金。
    此外，政府已经建议人民共和国主席团改进对于多子女母亲补助的办法。
