In my work at the CPPCC in Yangzhou City, Jiangsu Province, I would like to share my observations and experiences on how local CPPCCs can carry out their work.

In the past year, due to the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in the cities, and due to the Party's implementation of its policy toward intellectuals, the Yangzhou CPPCC has carried out a series of tasks in these two major movements, enabling the CPPCC to play a certain role in the local people's democratic political life, and consequently expanding the CPPCC's influence. In addition, the Party Central Committee put forth the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," which has greatly encouraged our local CPPCC workers and the people we connect with. Our united front is expanding, and enthusiasm for studying Marxism-Leninism is growing, while the initiative to advance towards science and culture is being mobilized. At the meetings convened by the CPPCC, everyone's speeches are more frank and open than before. On the basis of gradually expanding democracy, we are more closely united around the Party.

Strive for the Leadership of the CCP Committee and Give Play to an Active and Initiative Spirit

We believe that the gradual development of the CPPCC's work, in addition to objective reasons, requires subjective efforts. In the past, we also easily felt that the specific tasks of the CPPCC seemed rather vague, and we didn't know where to start. It was not like working in a business unit, where there are regular daily tasks to handle. Looking back, how did we gradually change this situation? There are several key points: First, it is necessary to have the leadership and care of responsible comrades of the CCP Committee. It is difficult to imagine the normal development and specific arrangements of the CPPCC's work without the leadership of the Party Committee. However, we comrades who work for the CPPCC must also strive to win the leadership of the Party Committee. The Party Committee Secretary, who usually concurrently serves as the Chairman of the CPPCC, can express his leadership and concern for the CPPCC's work in various forms. He regularly exchanges views on work with the responsible comrades of the CPPCC who are stationed in the office, pays attention to cultivating and training their ideological understanding and working ability, so that their enthusiasm can be fully exerted, and he frequently comes to the CPPCC to preside over meetings and has broad and cordial conversations with the members. All of this can promote the respect that the CPPCC should receive in the people. Second, we must be proactive and active. In order to increase the workload of the CPPCC, improve the quality of the CPPCC's work, and enable it to contribute more to the socialist democratic life, we must constantly study diligently, improve our theoretical level, and deeply understand the situation. Only in this way can we work together with Party and non-Party full-time and part-time comrades to conduct detailed discussions on relevant work issues at the CPPCC work conferences. The Yangzhou CPPCC and the Party Committee's United Front Work Department share an office in one building, which has achieved the effect of close cooperation. In this regard, we certainly need to be "unafraid to shoulder responsibility" and be brave in making suggestions, but we must also have a spirit of "readily accepting good advice." The study of the CPPCC's work itself should fully embody the high degree of unity between the Party's leadership and the promotion of democracy. In the Yangzhou CPPCC Committee, the relationship between Party and non-Party members is relatively normal and harmonious, and we can exchange opinions without restraint. We both engage in criticism and respect each other. The Vice-Chairmen, Deputy Secretaries-General, and many members who are stationed in the office have developed a love for the work of the CPPCC.

Give Play to the Strength of CPPCC Organ Cadres and Maintain Close Contact with CPPCC Members

Once the work plan is set on schedule, how can it be implemented? Here, it is necessary to grasp two links. On the one hand, the strength of the comrades working in the CPPCC organs must be fully exerted. Under the requirement of doing a good job in division of labor and cooperation, everyone should be allowed to do things freely, and the workload can be increased; collective summary of experience is a necessary way to improve quality. On the other hand, we must be good at contacting the members to give play to the collective potential. We can invite social figures and elderly intellectuals among the members to take turns working in the office. In fact, they can make a lot of work achievements for the CPPCC. At the same time, it is also necessary to combine the strength of the office staff of the local organizations of the democratic parties with the strength of the CPPCC staff. In addition, it is necessary to maintain frequent contact with the representative figures of the various democratic parties, people's organizations, and CPPCC working groups. We should take the initiative to visit them. For example, when holding some meetings, we must contact the meeting host or important related personnel in advance. This not only guarantees the success of the meeting, but also makes the responsible comrades and representative figures in all aspects further deepen their understanding of the spirit of the people's democratic united front policy embodied in the CPPCC's work. In summary, from the work plan to the specific implementation, the CPPCC's work must promote the democratic spirit within the people, and the full promotion of this people's democratic spirit is based on the leadership of the proletariat.

Precisely because the Yangzhou CPPCC has played a certain role in the local people's democratic life, people often think that the existence of the CPPCC is indispensable. Therefore, in addition to the CPPCC actively carrying out various tasks, it must also cooperate and adapt to various other political and social activities. In this way, the CPPCC can easily play its unifying role in adjusting mutual relations among all strata, parties, groups, and patriotic democratic figures. Through the work of the past few years, especially the work of the CPPCC in the past year, everyone feels that we have laid a preliminary foundation for the further development of the CPPCC's work in the future. The relationship between business circles, intellectuals, patriotic democratic figures, religious circles, and minority nationalities and the CPPCC is closer, and the contact between the CCP Committee and various government departments and the CPPCC is more frequent. Now, some people hope to negotiate this or that major event related to politics and people's lives through the CPPCC. We are doing very little, but we are on the road to work development. We hope that the CPPCC will truly become a forum for democratic politics led by the Party, a driving force for improving work and overcoming bureaucracy, and at the same time a political school to help everyone raise their socialist ideological awareness.

We cannot say that we have done everything very well in our work. We can only say that the experiences and lessons learned from past work are driving us forward. We are consolidating and promoting the advantages, and we are overcoming and correcting the shortcomings. For example, in the past, consultations on major measures in local political life were not frequent enough. We are working hard to overcome this shortcoming. Recently, the CPPCC held a meeting to conduct full consultation and enthusiastic debate on a health construction project that affects the people of the city, and as a result, two plans were put forward for administrative reference and selection. This has prompted comrades in all aspects to pay more attention to the CPPCC's consultative functions. Also, our meeting system is not frequent enough, and we have proposed to correct this in the work plan.

This third plenary session of the National Committee of the CPPCC itself embodies the further development of the CPPCC's work. We comrades who work for the local CPPCC have received great encouragement and inspiration from the meeting. The educational significance of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou's reports is very profound, and we must study them carefully. We sincerely hope that the National Committee of the CPPCC can give us regular guidance and criticism on our work.

### 发扬民主精神　开展地方政协工作  江树峰的发言

    发扬民主精神　开展地方政协工作
    江树峰的发言
    我是在江苏省扬州市政协工作的，我想就自己亲身体会到的观感来谈谈地方政协如何开展工作的。
    最近一年来，由于城市里进行了资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，由于党贯彻了对知识分子的政策，扬州市政协在这两大运动中做了一系列的工作，使政协在地方的人民民主的政治生活中发挥了它的一定作用，因而政协的影响在逐渐扩大。加之，党中央提出了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”、“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，这给与我们地方政协的工作人员和所联系的人士以巨大鼓舞。我们的团结面越来越大，各方面学习马列主义的情绪也越来越高涨，向科学文化进军的积极性正在调动起来。在政协召开的会议上，大家的发言比以往坦率而敞开得多了，在逐步扩大民主的基础上，我们更加亲密地团结在党的周围了。争取中共党委领导，发挥积极主动精神
    我们认为，政协工作的逐步展开，除了客观原因外，还得加上主观的努力。在以往，我们也同样容易感到政协的具体工作内容好像是比较空泛，不知从那里抓起，它不像事业单位每天都有经常工作好办。回忆一下，我们是怎样渐渐地把这情形改变过来的？其中有几个要点：首先是要有中共党委负责同志的领导和关怀。政协工作的正常发展与具体安排，离开了党委的领导是很难设想的。可是我们做政协工作的同志也必须努力争取党委的领导。党委书记一般是兼政协主席的，他对政协工作的领导与关怀可以通过各种形式表达出来。他与政协驻会办公的负责同志定期对工作交换意见，注意培养和锻炼他们的思想认识水平和工作能力，使他们的积极性充分发挥出来，他经常到政协来主持会议，并与委员们作广泛的亲切的交谈，这一切就可以促进政协在人民当中的地位获得应有的尊重。其次是我们必须主动积极。为了把政协的工作量加大，把政协的工作质量提高，使之能在社会主义的民主生活中多所贡献，我们就必须不断地用功钻研，提高理论水平，深入地了解情况，这样才能在政协工作会议上同党与非党的专职兼职同志一道，进行细致的有关工作问题的探讨。扬州市政协和党委统战部一屋两院办公，这样又取得了密切配合的效果。在这一方面，我们固然需要“当仁不让”地勇于建议，也要有“从善如流”的精神，政协工作的研究本身就应该充分体现党的领导与发扬民主的高度统一性。在扬州市政协委员会中，党与非党的关系是比较正常的、融洽的，我们之间能毫无拘束地交换意见。我们既展开批评，而又互相尊重。驻会办公的副主席、副秘书长以及好多委员们，都产生了热爱政协工作的感情。发挥政协机关干部的力量，密切同各政协委员的联系
    当工作按期订出计划后，又如何付诸实施呢？这里就必须抓住两个环节。一方面，要充分把政协机关中工作同志的力量充分发挥出来，在搞好分工合作的要求下，使大家放手干事，工作量是可以加大的；集体总结经验又是提高质量的必要途径。另一方面，必须善于和委员们联系，以发挥集体的潜力。我们可以邀请委员中的社会人士和老年知识分子来轮流驻会办公，事实上他们可以为政协作出好多工作成绩来。同时还要把各民主党派地方组织的办公人员的力量和政协工作人员的力量很好地汇合起来。还有，必须和各民主党派，各人民团体，政协各个工作组的代表性人士保持经常的接触，我们应该主动去拜访他们。如召开一些会议时，事先就必须和会议主持人或重要有关人士进行联系，这样既对会议开好起保证作用，而又使各方面的负责同志和代表人士对政协工作具体体现人民民主统一战线政策的精神格外加深。综上所述，就是从工作计划到具体实施，政协工作都必须发扬人民内部的民主精神，而这种人民民主精神的充分发扬是以无产阶级的领导为依归的。
    正由于扬州市政协在地方人民民主生活中起了一定的作用，人们的心目中时常能想到政协的存在是不可少的。因此，除政协主动进行各项工作外，还必须与其他方面的各项政治社会活动相配合、相适应。这样，政协在各阶层、各党派、各团体、各爱国民主人士当中就易于发挥其调整相互关系的团结作用。通过以往几年的工作，特别是去年一年的政协工作，使大家感觉到我们已经为今后政协工作的进一步发展奠定初步基础。工商界、知识分子、爱国民主人士、宗教界和少数民族人士和政协的关系是更加密切了，中共党委以及政府各部门和政协的接触也更加频繁了，现在有一些人希望把这桩或那桩有关政治与人民生活的大事，通过政协来协商。我们是做得很不够的，不过我们是走在工作发展的路上。我们希望政协真的成为党所领导的民主政治的讲坛，成为改进工作、克服官僚主义的推动机，同时成为帮助大家提高社会主义思想觉悟的政治学校。
    不能说我们在工作中一切都做得很好了。我们只能说，从以往工作中所得到的经验教训正在推动我们前进。我们对好处正在巩固发扬，对缺陷正在克服纠正。如以往对地方政治生活中的重大措施，协商尚不够经常。这一缺点，我们正在努力克服中。最近政协就曾举行一次会议，对影响全市人民的一项卫生建设工作进行了充分的协商和热情的辩论，结果是提出两个方案供行政参考选择。这就促使各方面的同志更加重视政协的协商职能。还有我们的会议制度还不够经常化，这一点我们已在工作计划中提出纠正。
    这次政协全国委员会第三次全体会议本身就体现了政协工作的进一步发展。我们做地方政协工作的同志从会议中得到了极大的鼓舞和启发。毛主席、周总理的报告给我们的教育意义是十分深刻的，我们必须认真地学习。我们热忱地希望政协全国委员会能对我们的工作经常给与指导和批评。
