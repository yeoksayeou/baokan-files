Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Beijing, March 25th. The Beijing Municipality held its 1956 Agricultural Labor Model Conference, proposing to further implement the principle of "serving the city" in this year's bumper harvest movement, and actively increase the production of various non-staple foods needed by the people of the capital. Although the planned output of various non-staple foods such as vegetables, live pigs, dairy cows, and fruits in the suburbs of Beijing this year has increased compared with the actual output last year, it still cannot meet the needs of the capital market. After discussion, the conference believed that the greatest efforts should be made to expand some new vegetable fields, and if there is dry land suitable for growing vegetables in the large fields, some vegetables such as green onions and radishes can also be planted. Furthermore, farmers should be encouraged and assisted in raising pigs, raising fish, ducks, chickens, and rabbits in large quantities, and fruit tree management should be strengthened. This year, preparations are being made to develop 410,000 apple, pear, peach, grape, and other fine varieties of fruit trees.

　　给首都人民多生产副食品
    据新华社讯  北京市二十五日举行1956年度农业劳动模范大会，提出要在今年的丰产运动中，进一步贯彻“为城市服务”的方针，积极增产为首都人民生产所需要的各种副食品。今年北京郊区的蔬菜、生猪、奶牛、水果等各种副食品的计划产量虽比去年的实产量有所增加，但仍不能满足首都市场的需要，大会经过讨论，认为应该尽最大的努力再扩大一些新菜田，大田地区如有适于种菜的旱地，也可以种植一些大葱、萝卜等蔬菜。并且应从各方面鼓励和帮助农民养猪，大量养鱼、养鸭、养鸡、养兔，并要加强果树管理。今年准备发展四十一万株苹果、梨、桃、葡萄等优良品种的果树。
