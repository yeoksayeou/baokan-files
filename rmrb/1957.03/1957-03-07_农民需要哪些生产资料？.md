What Production Materials Do Farmers Need?
　　Zhong Da

　　Editor's Note: The supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Hubei Province have conducted in-depth investigations and research in rural areas, and are carrying out supply work based on the actual needs of farmers for production materials this year. This work style is worth promoting. Investigations have shown that the production materials needed by farmers are not only different this year compared to last year, but also vary from region to region and from agricultural cooperative to agricultural cooperative within the same year. Therefore, to overcome subjectivism in the supply of production materials, it is necessary to strengthen investigation and research.

　　In order to cooperate with agricultural cooperatives in striving for a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year, the supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Hubei Province, through visits and the signing of combined contracts, have focused on investigating the changing needs of agricultural cooperatives for production materials.

　　After the realization of advanced cooperatives, what changes have taken place in the needs of rural areas for production materials? The investigation shows that on the basis of last year's bumper harvest, agricultural cooperatives are generally expanding production investment. According to a survey of six agricultural cooperatives in Mianyang, Tianmen, Macheng and other counties, this year's production investment plan has increased by 42% compared with last year, especially in cotton-producing areas. With the development of diversified economies, the variety of production materials needed by agricultural cooperatives has also increased. For example, mountainous areas such as Enshi and Yunxian require the supply of hunting guns, and many agricultural cooperatives require the supply of bee species, silkworm eggs, poultry and related breeding tools. Due to the expansion of multiple cropping areas, the demand for fertilizer has increased rapidly. After the universal increase in attendance rates of cooperative members, the demand for small farm tools has also greatly increased. However, because agricultural cooperatives have expanded collectively managed sideline production, some bamboo and wood small farm tools can be manufactured or repaired by themselves. The Chao Wan Agricultural Cooperative in Mianyang County needs the supply and marketing cooperative to provide 32% of its total production investment this year, of which the funds for purchasing small farm tools account for only 5.2%. Some agricultural cooperatives even have a surplus of self-produced farm tools. This requires the supply and marketing cooperative not only to supply small farm tools, but also to organize various agricultural cooperatives to exchange a portion of their surplus self-produced small farm tools. The Yunxian Supply and Marketing Cooperative organized the exchange of materials between agricultural cooperatives in four districts, with a single transaction of more than 140,000 yuan, including many small farm tools and sideline raw materials. As for new farm tools, especially double-wheeled double-shared plows, the number sold last year was relatively large, and the demand this year has decreased. In addition, agricultural cooperatives have some old farm tools that have been damaged and need help with repairs.

　　Based on these changes, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have made corresponding arrangements for this year's supply of production materials. The total supply amount for the province is planned to increase by 25.4% compared with last year, with the chemical fertilizers most needed by farmers increasing by 31.87%, miscellaneous fertilizers increasing by 30.43%, and double-wheeled double-shared plows decreasing by 54.49% compared with last year. By the end of January, the total value of production materials stored by supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels had reached 47.9 million yuan, 76.1% more than the same period last year, and goods had already begun to be allocated to rural areas in the fourth quarter of last year. In addition, various regions have also mutually adjusted draft animals. Jiayu, Hanchuan and other counties have purchased 3,500 heads of cattle from Ying Shan and Anlu.

　　This year, technical guidance and repair work for new farm tools and pesticide machinery has also been strengthened. 1.2 million county-level and grass-roots cadres in the province have received technical training, and they will become guides for rural technicians. Xiangyang Special District has organized supply and marketing cooperatives, agricultural bureaus, farm tool factories, handicraft repair stations and other departments to go deep into the fields, adopting the method of checking, repairing, experimenting, and imparting technology at the same time to summarize the experience of farmers in using new farm tools. Some areas have also organized craftsmen to go to the countryside to repair farm tools for agricultural cooperatives. Echeng County has now basically achieved "red stoves in every township and carpenters in every cooperative", which is very convenient for agricultural cooperatives to repair farm tools.

　　At present, party and government departments in various parts of Hubei attach great importance to doing a good job in the supply of production materials. Puqi County has established a production materials supply office to coordinate the supply of production materials. However, because preparations for production materials began earlier in various regions this year, the number of reserves is large, and the varieties are relatively complete, some cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives have therefore developed a sense of complacency, believing that the supply of goods is sufficient this year and there is no major problem; some supply and marketing cooperatives have relaxed their organizational leadership in the production of old farm tools; some regions have not yet adjusted draft animals and fertilizers in a timely manner. These problems need to be solved urgently.

    农民需要哪些生产资料？
    钟达
    编者按　湖北省各地供销合作社，深入农村调查研究，根据农民今年对生产资料的实际需要情况，进行供应工作。这种工作作风值得提倡。调查证明：农民所需要的生产资料，不仅今年和去年有所不同；就是在同一年，这个地区和那个地区，这个农业社和那个农业社也各有不同。因此，要克服生产资料供应工作中的主观主义，就必须加强调查研究工作。
    湖北省各地供销合作社为了配合农业社争取今年农业生产大丰收，通过访问和订立结合合同，重点调查了农业社对生产资料需要的变化情况。
    在实现高级合作化以后，农村对生产资料的需要究竟有哪些变化呢？从调查中看出：在去年丰收的基础上，农业社普遍扩大生产投资。据沔阳、天门、麻城等县六个农业社的调查，今年生产投资计划比去年扩大42％，尤以棉产区扩大较多。随着多种经济的开展，农业社需要的生产资料的品种也增加了。如：恩施、郧县等山区要求供应猎枪，还有许多农业社要求供应蜂种、蚕种、家禽及有关的饲养工具。由于复种面积的扩大，肥料的需要量迅速增加。社员出勤率普遍提高以后，小农具的需要量也大大增长。但是，因为农业社扩大了集体经营的副业生产，若干竹、木小农具都可以自己制造或修配。沔阳县潮垸农业社需要供销社供应的生产资料占今年生产总投资的32％，其中购买小农具的资金只占5.2％。有的农业社自产农具还有剩余。这就要求供销社不仅要供应小农具，而且要组织各农业社交流自产有剩余的一部分小农具。郧县供销社组织四个区的农业社交流物资，一次即成交十四万多元，其中有许多小农具及副业原料。至于新式农具，特别是双轮双铧犁，去年推销的数量较大，今年的需要量就减少了。此外，各农业社都有一些旧农具已经破损，需要帮助修理。
    根据这些变化，各地供销社对今年的生产资料供应工作作了相应的安排。全省的供应总额计划比去年增加25.4％，农民最需要的化学肥料增加了31.87％，杂肥增加30.43％，双轮双铧犁则比去年减少54.49％。到1月底，各级供销社储备生产资料的总值已达四千七百九十万元，较去年同期多76.1％，而且在去年第四季度就已开始向农村拨货。此外，各地还互相调剂了耕畜，嘉鱼、汉川等县已从应山、安陆购进耕牛三千五百头。
    今年对新式农具和农药械的技术指导和修补工作也加强了。全省有一百二十万名县级和基层干部受了技术训练，他们将成为农村技术手的指导者。襄阳专区已组织供销社、农业局、农具厂、手工业修配站等部门深入田间，采取边检查，边修理，边试验，边传授技术的方法，总结农民使用新式农具的经验。有些地区还组织手工业者下乡，给农业社修配农具。鄂城县现在已经基本上作到“乡乡有红炉，社社有木匠”，这对农业社修理农具有很大方便。
    目前湖北各地党和政府部门对做好生产资料供应工作都很重视。蒲圻县已经成立了生产资料供应办公室，统一筹划生产资料的供应工作。但是，由于今年各地对生产资料准备工作动手较早，储备的数量较多，品种也较齐全，部分供销社的干部因此产生了自满情绪，认为今年货源充足，问题不大；有的供销社放松了对生产旧式农具的组织领导；有的地区还没有及时调剂耕畜、肥料。这些问题都亟待解决。
