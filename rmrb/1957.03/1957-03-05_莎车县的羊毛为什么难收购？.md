    Why is it difficult to purchase wool in Shache County?
    In Shache County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, rural workers often say, "Purchasing wool is extremely difficult."
    Why is this? Now, let me analyze the reasons for this problem based on what I have seen in one township.
    What methods do they use to complete the task of purchasing wool? First, they mobilize the masses to sell wool to the state, and a small number of people voluntarily sold their wool. Later, the purchasing agents would carry a "taher" (sack), take a scale, and go door-to-door to the sheep-raising households to purchase wool. Some adopted the method of "ideological mobilization". If they couldn't "get through", they would criticize or forcibly order the sale. Some would search themselves, and after finding the wool, weigh it, calculate the amount of money, stuff the money into the farmers' hands, and carry the wool away. Some even adopted more "ingenious" methods, going to schools to mobilize elementary school students to report how much wool their families had and where it was stored, declaring that whoever reported the most would be rewarded with a pencil. After reporting, the students would be beaten and scolded by their parents. Later, some farmers preferred to let the wool grow on the sheep rather than shear it at the appropriate time. However, the task of purchasing wool had to be completed, so these cadres came up with new methods. They brought several people who knew how to shear wool, took scissors, and went to the farmers' pastures and sheepfolds to shear the wool themselves. In short, they exhausted all methods, and the cadres were satisfied that they had completed the task. Sometimes, they were even specially praised by their superiors, who said, "So-and-so township has done a good job in completing the wool purchase task."
    Why are the masses unwilling to sell wool? Is it because of low consciousness? No. They support the Party's various policies and respond to the government's calls. They also know why the state wants to purchase wool. They only ask the purchasing personnel: "As long as you can leave me enough wool to make a felt and two pairs of felt socks, I will sell the rest to the state." When some farmers were forced to take out wool to sell, they pleaded with the cadres not to pay them temporarily, but to write down their names and give them a felt when the state-supplied felts arrived, "I will thank you." The fundamental reason lies here. After the state purchases all the wool, the masses will have no felts to spread, the number supplied by the state is limited, and they cannot buy them on the free market at all. Of course, the masses are unwilling to sell wool. In this township I saw, there are a total of 772 households and more than 2,800 people, producing 1,487 kilograms of wool annually. The state purchases 1,300 kilograms, leaving 187 kilograms (or slightly more), which can only make about 20 felts and 50 pairs of felt socks. According to the customs of the Uygur people, regardless of men, women, old, or young, they all wear long leather boots in winter, with a layer of felt socks inside to keep warm. The vast majority of farmers, and even the wealthy, do not sleep on wooden beds or kangs, but simply spread a thick layer of hemp grass on the ground, or a layer of reed mats, and then spread a felt on top. In addition to their own use, they also need to prepare one or two felts at home for guests. From this, it can be seen how large the difference is between the amount of wool left and the amount needed by the farmers. Now, most farmers have no felts to spread, or only a little tattered felt. They are complaining and dissatisfied.
    According to my understanding, this situation exists to varying degrees in more than 150 townships throughout the county, and even in other agricultural counties. The result of purchasing wool in this way is not only "extremely difficult" to purchase wool, but also affects the development of other work, the implementation of the government's and the Party's ethnic policies, and the relationship between the state and the masses.

### 莎车县的羊毛为什么难收购？

    莎车县的羊毛为什么难收购？
    在新疆维吾尔自治区莎车县，经常听到农村来的工作人员说：“收购羊毛实在难到极点。”
    为什么呢？现在就我在一个乡所看到的情况来分析一下发生这个问题的原因。
    他们采取什么办法来完成收购羊毛的任务呢？先是动员群众把羊毛卖给国家，有少数群众自动出售了羊毛。以后，收购员就背上塔合尔（口袋），拿上秤，挨门到养羊户去收购。有的采取“打通思想”的方式，打不“通”，就批评或强令出售。有的就自己搜寻，搜出后，用秤一秤，算出钱数，把钱塞到农民手里，就把毛背走了。有的还采取了更“高明”的办法，到学校里动员小学生自报他家有多少毛，放在什么地方，并宣称谁报得多就奖给谁一支铅笔，学生报告后，回家就受到父母亲的打骂。以后有些农民宁愿让毛在羊身上长着，也不敢把它适时剪下来了。可是，收购羊毛的任务总得完成，这些干部的新办法又出来了。他们带上几个会剪毛的人，拿上剪刀，到农民放羊的草场上和羊圈里去自己剪。总之办法是想尽了，干部满意自己完成了任务，有时上级还特加表扬，说“某乡购毛任务完成得很好”。
    群众为什么不愿意出售羊毛呢？是不是由于觉悟低？不是。他们对党的各项政策是拥护的，对政府的各项号召是响应的，他们也知道国家为什么要收购羊毛。他们只是要求收购人员：“只要你能给我留下能做一条毡子和两双毡袜子的毛，多余的我都卖给国家。”有的农民被迫把毛拿出来卖的时候，恳求干部暂时不要付款，记下他的名字，只要等国家供应的毡子来后，给他一条毡子，“我就谢谢您”。根本原因就在这里。国家把羊毛收购完以后，群众就会铺不上毡子，国家供应的数量又有限，自由市场上根本买不到，群众当然不愿出售羊毛。像我看到的这个乡，共有七百七十二户，二千八百多口人，每年生产羊毛一千四百八十七公斤，国家收购一千三百公斤，还剩一百八十七公斤（或稍多于此数），只可做二十余条毡子和五十多双毡袜子。而按照维吾尔族的风俗习惯，不论男、女、老、少，冬天都穿长皮靴，里边穿一层毡袜子御寒。绝大多数农民，甚至有钱人都不睡木床和炕，只是就地厚厚的铺一层葫麻草，或再铺一层苇席，上边铺上毡子就行了。除自用的外，家中还需备一两条毡子待客。由此可见，留下的羊毛数量和农民的需要量相差有多大。现在的情况已是多数农民没毡子铺，或只有一点破毡子，他们在发牢骚，不满意。
    据我了解，全县一百五十多个乡，甚至其他农业县，也程度不同地存在着这种情况。这样收购羊毛的结果，不但收购羊毛“难到极点”，而且会影响其他工作的开展，影响到政府和党的民族政策的贯彻执行，影响到国家和群众的关系。
