Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, March 3rd: Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Hua reports: Many agricultural cooperatives in Hebei Province have to varying degrees shown conservative thinking when formulating this year's production increase plans. At present, party and government leading organs at all levels throughout the province are helping agricultural cooperatives correct this phenomenon.

The main manifestation of conservative thinking is setting too low of production increase targets. The normal yield of cotton in the Tiantaishan Agricultural Cooperative in Feixiang County is 180 to 200 jin of seed cotton per mu. This year, the cooperative only set an increase target of 170 jin for the production teams under the "three guarantees" system. The grain increase target of the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Chengde County is 20,000 jin less than last year's actual output, only equivalent to 70% of the local normal yield. The production increase target has lost its role in encouraging cooperative members to work hard in production.

Another manifestation of conservative thinking is the inappropriate accommodation of cooperative members' living needs, excessively reducing the planting area of high-yield crops. According to statistics from sixteen counties in Baoding Prefecture, the planned planting area of sweet potatoes by agricultural cooperatives has decreased by 230,000 mu compared to the actual planting area last year. This item alone will result in a reduction of about 50 million jin of grain. According to a survey of forty-nine agricultural cooperatives in Leting County, the planned planting area of corn this year has decreased by 19.5% compared to last year. Sweet potatoes have decreased by 9.6%. Due to the large reduction in the planting of these high-yield crops, the total grain output of these cooperatives this year will only increase by 3.4% compared to last year. The Manzhoupo Agricultural Cooperative in Huaian County increased grain production by 240,000 jin by planting corn last year, but this year it will also reduce corn planting by half compared to last year.

The main reason for the emergence of conservative thinking is that many cooperative cadres and members, when criticizing the excessively high production increase targets last year, failed to realistically understand last year's achievements and mistakes, and thus developed the idea of preferring lower targets to higher ones. The Datunqiu Agricultural Cooperative in Wuqing County failed to achieve its high production increase plan last year. When formulating the plan this year, the vice-chairman of the cooperative advocated reducing the planting of all crops by two-thirds compared to last year, saying that this would save trouble, ensure over-production, and satisfy both cadres and members. In addition, some cadres are afraid of making mistakes and fail to take charge, and the reference targets assigned are also too low. According to a check in five townships in Yuanshi County, the county-assigned unit area increase targets for cotton and soybeans are only equivalent to 67% of the cooperatives' planned targets.

Now, Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, and other places in this province are actively taking measures to help agricultural cooperatives examine and correct the above-mentioned deviations. According to the experience of various places in Hebei, in order to overcome the conservative thinking of cooperative members and cadres in formulating plans, it is necessary to implement the class line and comprehensively summarize last year's experiences and achievements. When revising the production increase plan, the Libaozi Victory Agricultural Cooperative in Yuxian County separately solicited the opinions of poor and middle peasant members. The middle peasant members advocated planting more low-yield millet and sorghum to improve the lives of the members; the poor peasant members advocated planting more high-yield corn. The cooperative cadres submitted these two opinions to the members for discussion. Most members realized that planting more high-yield crops could not only increase the income of the members but also increase grain production for the country. Therefore, the production increase plan was formulated actively and reliably, taking into account the lives of the members and conforming to the overall interests of the country. Last year, the Gongjiawa Agricultural Cooperative in Nangong County suffered a serious reduction in the yield of non-waterlogged millet planted in low-lying areas, while appropriate dense planting of cotton and wheat increased yields. When formulating the production increase plan this year, in addition to learning from last year's lessons and changing the low-lying areas to planting water-resistant sorghum, based on summarizing last year's successful experiences, they determined five production increase measures, such as appropriate dense planting and increased fertilizer application. The production increase targets for various crops and the total income of the cooperative all exceeded the normal output.

People's Daily, Guangzhou, 2nd: The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China successively proposed to local party committees at the end of February: Party committees at all levels must concentrate their efforts to conduct direct and specific leadership over agricultural production and reverse the current slow progress of spring planting preparations. They must help agricultural cooperatives to do a good job in production planning and the "three guarantees" work, so that the production movement can be carried out comprehensively and deeply.

At present, early rice planting has begun in some areas of Guangdong Province, and economic crops such as sugarcane and peanuts have also begun to be planted. The comprehensive busy season of spring plowing is approaching. However, according to statistics in late February, the amount of fertilizer accumulated in various places throughout the province is nearly half less than in the same period last year. The fertilizer accumulation plan of many counties has only completed 50%. Of the 471 key water conservancy projects planned for the province, only 21 had been completed by mid-February; of the more than 91,000 small-scale water conservancy projects planned, only more than 24,000 had been completed.

In terms of production planning, according to incomplete statistics from 63 counties, agricultural cooperatives that have formulated production plans account for 37.7%, and those that have not yet started account for 21.8%. In the plans that have been formulated, many townships and cooperatives have low targets and take a negative attitude towards various production increase measures. According to the Zhanjiang Prefectural Committee, in the 13 cooperatives in Dongjian Township, Leidong County, the output targets of six cooperatives are lower than the actual output of last year. Many effective technologies that were used last year, such as sparse sowing and cultivating strong seedlings, suitable seedling fields, using improved varieties, and densely planting small seedlings, are also not planned to be adopted. In production planning, some agricultural cooperatives in various places, to varying degrees, neglect finding ways to increase income from multiple sources, and one-sidedly reduce the planting area of grain and expand the planting area of economic crops.

The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has made a comprehensive analysis of the above situation and believes that the important thing is that the leadership of the current production movement is not concentrated and strong enough. The Provincial Committee instructed local party committees to strengthen the leadership of the movement, with the secretaries personally taking action, organizing forces, and vigorously promoting the rapid development of water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, implementation of production increase measures, and a concentrated effort to complete spring afforestation.

In order to strengthen leadership, the Provincial Committee decided to send secretaries, ministers and deputy ministers, and the Provincial People's Committee to send directors of departments, totaling more than 20 people, to leave immediately for various places to help with the work.

### 河北纠正生产规划中的保守思想  广东大力扭转春耕准备工作的迟缓状态

    河北纠正生产规划中的保守思想
    广东大力扭转春耕准备工作的迟缓状态
    新华社保定3日电  新华社记者张华报道：河北省许多农业社在制订今年增产计划时，有不同程度的保守思想。目前全省各级党政领导机关正在帮助农业社纠正这种现象。
    保守思想的主要表现是增产指标偏低。肥乡县天台山农业社棉花的常年产量是亩产籽棉一百八十斤至二百斤，今年这个社向生产队包工包产的增产指标才订了一百七十斤。承德县五星农业社今年粮食的增产指标，比去年的实际产量还少两万斤，仅相当于当地常年产量的七成收成。增产指标已经失掉了鼓舞社员努力生产的作用。
    保守思想的另一种表现是不适当的迁就社员的生活需要，过多的减少高产作物的种植面积。据保定专区十六个县的统计，农业社计划种植的甘薯面积，即比去年实播面积减少了二十三万亩，仅此一项，即将减收五千万斤左右的粮食。另据乐亭县四十九个农业社的调查，今年玉米的计划播种面积比去年减少了19.5％。甘薯减少了9.6％。由于这些高产作物的大量减种，这些社今年的粮食总产量比去年只能增产3.4％。怀安县满州坡农业社，去年种玉米增产二十四万斤粮食，今年也要比去年少种一半玉米。
    产生保守思想的主要原因，是许多社干部和社员在批判去年增产指标偏高现象时，不能实事求是的认识去年的成绩和错误，因而又产生了宁低勿高的想法。武清县大顿丘农业社去年的增产计划偏高没实现，今年订计划时该社副社长即主张各种作物一律比去年下降三分之二，并且说这样既省心又能超产，干部社员都满意。另外也有些干部存在怕犯错误放手不管的情绪，分配的参考指标也偏低。据元氏县在五个乡的检查，县分配的棉花、大豆单位面积增产指标，仅相当社计划指标的67％。
    现在，这个省张家口、石家庄等地都积极采取措施帮助农业社检查纠正上述偏向。根据河北各地经验，克服社员干部在订计划当中的保守思想，必须贯彻阶级路线和全面总结去年的经验和成绩。蔚县李堡子胜利农业社在修订增产计划时，分别征求了贫农和中农社员的意见，中农社员主张多种产量低的谷子和黍子，改善社员生活；贫农社员则主张多种产量高的玉米。社干部把这两种意见一并交社员讨论，多数社员都认识了多种高产作物既能增加社员收入，又给国家增产粮食的道理，因此，增产计划便订得积极可靠，照顾了社员生活，也符合国家整体利益。南宫县巩家洼农业社去年在洼地种不耐涝的谷子严重减产，棉花、小麦适当密植增加了收成，今年制订增产计划时，除接受去年的教训将洼地改种为耐涝的高粱外，并且在总结去年的成功经验的基础上，确定了适当密植、增加肥料等五项增产措施，各种作物的增产指标和社的总收入，全超过了常年产量。
    本报广州2日电  中共广东省委在2月底连续向各地党委提出：各级党委必须集中力量对农业生产进行直接的具体的领导，扭转当前春季备耕进展迟缓的状态。帮助农业社做好生产规划和“三包”工作，使生产运动全面地深入地开展起来。
    目前广东省部分地区已经开始早稻播种，甘蔗花生等经济作物也开始种植，全面的春耕大忙季节已日渐迫近了。但据2月下旬的统计，全省各地积肥数目比去年同期相差将近一半。有不少县的积肥计划还只完成50％。全省计划的四百七十一项重点水利工程，至2月中旬只完成了二十一项；小型水利计划九万一千多宗，只完成了有二万四千多宗。
    在生产规划方面，据六十三个县不完全统计，已制订了生产规划的农业社占37.7％，尚未动手的还有21.8％。而在已制订的规划中，也有不少乡社存在指标偏低和对各项增产措施采取消极态度的现象。据湛江地委反映，雷东县东涧乡的十三个社中，就有六个社的产量指标低于去年的实际产量。许多地区一些去年行之有效的疏播育壮秧、合式秧田、采用良种、小科密植等技术也不打算采用了。在生产规划中，各地程度不同地都有一部分农业社忽视从多方面找门路来达到增加收入，而片面地缩小粮食播种面积扩大经济作物种植面积。
    中共广东省委对以上情况作了全面分析，认为重要的是由于各地对当前生产运动的领导不够集中不够有力。省委指示各地党委必须加强对运动的领导，书记亲自动手，组织力量，大力推动水利、积肥、贯彻增产措施及突击完成春季造林等工作的迅速开展。
    为了加强领导，省委决定派出书记、正副部长，省人民委员会派出厅长等共二十多人立即出发赴各地帮助工作。
