    The incident of U.S. soldier Somagahara shooting and killing Japanese farmer Sakai Naka has become one of the major issues reported by Japanese newspapers in recent days. U.S. soldiers causing trouble and killing people has been a frequent occurrence in Japan. According to the "Yomiuri Shimbun," since October 1953, when the jurisdiction over crimes committed by U.S. military personnel in Japan during off-duty hours was returned to Japan, the prosecutor's offices in various parts of Japan had accepted more than 22,000 cases by the end of August last year, but only 80 of them were prosecuted in Japanese courts. The vast majority were quietly dropped. The fact that Japanese newspapers have devoted so much space to reporting the death of an ordinary person for days in a row, the Somagahara incident is considered the first since the death of Japanese fisherman Aikichi Kuboyama in the hydrogen bomb test on Bikini Atoll in September 1954. From this point of view, Sakai Naka's blood was not shed in vain, compared to many innocent people who were buried in silence. Her blood has brightened the eyes of more Japanese people, making them see the sad reality of a "foreign country within their own country," and the sad plight of the tens of thousands of residents around the bases who have been deprived of their land and have to rely on picking up shell casings and selling scrap iron to make a living.

    The "Asahi Shimbun" published a letter on February 8th, signed "A Worker of the National Railways," which stated: "The Somagahara incident makes us tremble. ...Please, if a foreign country establishes a military base in its own country to defend itself, it will not even be able to protect its own country in the end. This is extremely obvious."

    However, there are other views. The newly appointed Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, when answering questions in the Diet about this incident as acting Prime Minister some time ago, although he admitted that this was one of the many incidents that "a nation cannot tolerate," he did not forget to add: "Given the current international situation, we cannot demand the early withdrawal of the U.S. military."

    Regarding the Somagahara incident, because the Japanese and American sides have different opinions on whether the incident occurred during the performance of official duties, the issue of who has jurisdiction has been submitted to the Criminal Special Committee of the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee, and it seems that haggling is still going on.

    As for the "performance of official duties" claimed by the U.S. military, according to the "Yomiuri Shimbun," there was even such a precedent: In the autumn of 1953, a U.S. soldier stationed in Maizuru City broke into a private house and raped a woman during a patrol. The U.S. side defended this incident by saying that "patrolling is performing official duties, so the Japanese side has no jurisdiction."

    An editorial in the "Hokkaido Shimbun" said well: "Documents written in ink cannot cover up the reality written in blood." How the Somagahara incident is handled will make the Japanese people see how much weight the "autonomy" touted by certain figures in power actually has. Because people are not only educated by the reality written in blood, but also by the lies written in ink.

### 血写的和墨写的

    血写的和墨写的
    相马原美兵枪杀日本农妇坂井中事件，已成为日本各大报纸近日来报道的重要问题之一。美兵的肇事、杀人，在日本原是迭出不穷的。据“读卖新闻”载：自1953年10月，驻日美军人员非执行公务时间内的犯罪裁判权归属日本以来，截至去年8月底，日本各地检察厅受理的案件即达二万二千余件，而其中向日本裁判所起诉的却只有八十件。绝大部分都默默而息了。日本各大报纸对于一个普通人的死，分出如许篇幅来连日加以报道，在1954年9月日本渔夫久保山爱吉死于比基尼岛的氢弹试验之后，相马原事件还算是第一次。从这一点来说，比起许多被沉默埋葬了的无辜者，坂井中的血是没有白流的。她的血洗亮了更多的日本人民的眼睛，使他们看到“祖国中的外国”的可悲的现实，看到那被夺了土地、不得不靠拣弹壳、卖碎铁来维持生计的成千上万的基地周围居民的可悲的处境。
    2月8日“朝日新闻”载有署名为“国营铁路一工人”的来信，其中写道：“相马原事件使我们战栗。……请外国在自己国家内设立军事基地来防卫自己的国家，结果连自己国家也会保不住，这是极为明显的。”
    然而也有另外的看法。新近登台拜相的岸信介，前些时候作为代理首相在国会答辩有关这一事件的质询时，虽然也承认这是
  “作为一个民族忍无可忍的”许多事件之一，但他没有忘记紧接着补充一句：“鉴于目前国际形势，还不能要求美军及早撤退。”
    相马原事件，由于日美双方对于事件究竟是不是发生在执行公务时间内持有不同意见，裁判权属谁的问题，已提交给日美联合委员会的刑事特别委员会，现在似乎仍在扯皮。
    至于美军所说的“执行公务”，据“读卖新闻”所载，甚至有过这样的先例：1953年秋，驻扎在舞鹤市的美军一大兵，在巡逻中闯入民宅强奸妇女，美方为这一事件辩护，竟也说成“巡逻中，即是在执行公务，所以日本方面没有裁判权”。
      “北海道新闻”的一篇社论说得好：“墨写的文件掩盖不了血写的现实”。相马原事件究竟如何处理，会使日本人民看到某些当权人物所标榜的“自主”到底有多少份量。因为人民不仅从血写的现实里受到教育，也将从墨写的谎言里受到教育。
