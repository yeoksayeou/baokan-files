    Nehru Advocates
    Direct Talks Between Soviet and US Leaders on Middle East Issues
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 2nd: According to the Press Trust of India, Indian Prime Minister Nehru advocated on March 1st that the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union should hold a meeting to discuss their respective Middle East proposals.
    Nehru, speaking at an election rally in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, believed that while there were many differences between the US and Soviet proposals, both had merit.
    Nehru said, "I don't want to praise or criticize either of these proposals. I think there are things worth considering in both proposals, and I hope they can be considered well, but not in a military way, but in a peaceful way."
    In his speech, Nehru advocated for direct negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on the Middle East issue and hoped that the leaders of the two countries would hold talks at some point. He said that if the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union could discuss these two proposals, then at least to some extent, a way could be found to achieve peace in the Middle East. "Even if we have to continue to work hard to find a solution through consultation, we will eventually succeed."

    尼赫鲁主张
    苏美领袖直接谈判中东问题
    新华社新德里2日电  据印度报业托辣斯报道：印度总理尼赫鲁3月1日主张美国和苏联领袖们举行会议讨论彼此的中东建议。
    尼赫鲁在北方邦密拉特的一次竞选大会上发表演说，他认为美苏两国的建议中有很多不同的地方，但是都有可取之处。
    尼赫鲁说：“我不想对这两个建议中任何一种建议有所褒贬。我认为，这两种建议中都有一些值得考虑的东西，我希望能够很好地考虑这两个建议，但是不能用军事方式，而要用和平方式。”
    尼赫鲁在演说中主张美国和苏联就中东问题进行直接谈判，并且希望两国领袖在某个时候举行会谈。他说，如果美国和苏联的领袖们能够讨论这两种建议的话，那么，至少在某种程度上能够找到一个使中东地区实现和平的办法。“即使还要继续努力通过协商求得解决，总有一天会成功。”
