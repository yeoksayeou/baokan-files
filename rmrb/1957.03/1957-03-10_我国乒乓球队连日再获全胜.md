Xinhua News Agency report:

Our Chinese table tennis team achieved complete victories in the World Table Tennis Championships on the 8th and 9th. The Chinese women's team defeated the Welsh and English teams in their group, while the men's team defeated Luxembourg and India.

In the women's team competition Group Three, the American team had been winning continuously in three matches in the past two days, but lost to the Chinese team, which had won all three of its matches, in a game on the 8th, with a total score of three to one. In the previous competition, the Chinese team was also in the same group as the American team, and lost to the American team by two to three at that time.

That evening, the Chinese women's team defeated the Welsh team, ranked sixth in the first tier in terms of technical level, by a score of three to zero.

On the morning of the 9th, the Chinese women's team defeated the seeded team, England, by a score of three to one, thus removing the biggest obstacle on the road to winning the group championship.

England's technical level was rated as second in the first tier last year, and it is the seeded team in Group Three of this women's team competition. In last year's World Table Tennis Championships, it defeated the Chinese women's team by a score of three to one.

The Chinese women's team is the only team in Group Three that has maintained a record of winning every match so far. In the future, as long as they defeat the Norwegian and Danish teams, they can compete with the winners of the first and second groups for the women's team championship of the 24th World Table Tennis Championships.

In the men's team competition, the Chinese men's team in Group One defeated their opponents by five to zero in both matches, and did not lose a single game, achieving a record of four wins in four matches since the start of the competition.

    我国乒乓球队连日再获全胜
    据新华社讯：中国乒乓球队8日和9日在世界乒乓球锦标赛中获得了全胜。中国女子选手击败了同组中的威尔士队和英格兰队，男子选手击败了卢森堡队和印度队。
    在女子团体赛第三组中，美国队这两天来在三场比赛中都连连获胜，但是在8日的一场比赛中却输给了三战三捷的中国队，这场比赛的总分数是三比一。中国队在上届比赛中也是同美国队分在一组，当时以二比三输给了美国队。
    当天晚上，中国女子选手又以三比○战胜了技术水平分在第一级第六名的威尔士队。
    9日上午，中国女子队又以三比一的比数击败种子队——英格兰队，从而扫除了争取小组冠军道路上最大的障碍。
    英格兰队的技术水平去年被评为第一级第二名，它是这一届女子团体赛第三组的种子队。去年的世界乒乓球锦标赛中，它曾经以三比一击败过中国女子队。
    中国女子队是第三组中到现在为止保持着每战每胜纪录唯一的一个队。以后，她们只要战胜挪威队和丹麦队就可以同第一、二组的优胜者夺取第二十四届世界乒乓球锦标赛的女子团体赛冠军了。
    在男子团体赛中，第一组的中国男子队在两场比赛中都是以五比○击败对方的，而且没有输过一局，获得了比赛开始以来四战四胜的战绩。
