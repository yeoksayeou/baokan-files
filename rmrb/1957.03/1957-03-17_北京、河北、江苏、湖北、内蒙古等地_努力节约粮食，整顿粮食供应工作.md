    Strive to save food and rectify grain supply work
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Beijing, Hebei, Jiangsu, Hubei, Inner Mongolia and other provinces and regions have achieved certain results in saving food and rectifying grain supply work.
    After initial rectification of grain sales work in Beijing, the long-term trend of rising grain sales has stopped. As of the end of February, the city had adjusted grain supplies to the catering, pastry industries, and some government offices and citizens, resulting in a monthly reduction in sales of more than 7.5 million jin. Employees of central and Beijing municipal government agencies and enterprises generally felt that the previous grain rations were too high, and they requested reductions one after another. Some people even saved a portion of their grain on the basis of reduced rations. According to statistics from 2,500 units, each person saved an average of two jin of grain per month. Many collective mess halls also returned surplus grain in storage to the grain departments or used it to offset next month's grain purchase figures. The grain supply work for street residents, based on the spirit of "guaranteeing enough to eat and overcoming waste," is being rectified. By the end of February, more than 84,000 households had voluntarily requested to reduce grain purchases, saving more than 2 million jin of grain per month.
    Hebei Province suffered a severe flood last year. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) put forward the requirement to "save 500 million jin of grain throughout the province to support production in the disaster areas." Now, all parts of the province are tapping various potentials for saving grain to achieve this requirement. According to statistics from units and citizens in Baoding City alone, from the beginning of the year to the end of February, more than 1.07 million jin of grain had been saved. The Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC and the Governor took the lead in eating coarse grains and reduced their original monthly rations by two to three jin respectively.
    After rectifying the grain unified purchase and marketing work, the phenomenon of wasting grain has been basically reversed in various cities and towns in Jiangsu Province. According to statistics from 70 cities and counties, the current monthly grain supply is reduced by 60 million jin compared with before the rectification.
    In more than a dozen small towns and county towns such as Hanyang, Wuchang, Tuanfeng, and Mianyang in Hubei Province, the adjustment of grain rations among more than 162,000 residents recently resulted in a monthly savings of more than 170,000 jin of grain; industry grain consumption in these towns saved 306,000 jin per month. This shows that there are also phenomena of waste and unreasonable supply of grain in small towns. As long as the local party and government leading departments carry out in-depth publicity and education for residents and verify the supply volume based on realistic facts, grain consumption can be reduced.
    From December of last year to the beginning of March of this year, 19 cities and towns in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, including Hohhot, Baotou, and Manzhouli, have saved more than 882,000 jin of grain. Manzhouli City launched a city-wide cafeteria competition focusing on saving grain, which significantly reduced industry grain consumption throughout the city. In Ulanhot City, four neighborhood committees mobilized residents to adjust grain among themselves, resulting in a surplus of more than 1,400 jin of grain.

### 北京、河北、江苏、湖北、内蒙古等地  努力节约粮食，整顿粮食供应工作

    北京、河北、江苏、湖北、内蒙古等地
    努力节约粮食，整顿粮食供应工作
    本报讯　北京市、河北、江苏、湖北、内蒙古等省区在节约粮食和整顿粮食供应工作上，已经取得了一定的成绩。
    北京市粮食销售工作经过初步整顿后，长期以来粮食销量一直上升的趋势已经停止。截至2月底止，全市对饮食、糕点业和一部分机关、市民调整了粮食供应的结果，每月降低销量七百五十多万斤。中央和北京市机关、企业的职工普遍感到过去的粮食定量偏高，纷纷要求降低，有些人还在降低定量的基础上节约一部分粮食。据二千五百个单位的统计，每人每月平均节约了二斤粮食。很多集体伙食单位还把库存多余的粮食退给粮食部门或充抵下月购粮数字。街道居民的粮食供应工作，本着“保证够吃、克服浪费”的精神，正在进行整顿。到2月底，已有八万四千多户居民主动提出减少购粮量，每月可节约粮食二百多万斤。
    河北省去年遭受了严重的水灾，中共河北省委提出在全省“节约五亿斤粮食支持灾区生产”的要求，现在全省各地正在为实现这个要求，挖掘各种节约粮食的潜力。仅据保定市各单位和市民从年初到2月底为止的统计，已经节约了一百零七万多斤粮食。中共河北省委书记和省长都带头吃粗粮，并把自己原来每月定量的标准分别减少了二斤到三斤。
    江苏省各市镇经过整顿粮食统销工作后，基本上扭转了浪费粮食的现象。据七十个市、县统计，现在每月粮食供应量比整顿前减少六千万斤。
    湖北省汉阳、武昌、团风、沔阳等十几个小市镇和县城城关，最近在十六万二千多个居民中调整粮食的结果，每月节约粮食十七万多斤；这些城镇的行业用粮每月节省了三十万六千斤。这就说明了，小城镇也存在着浪费粮食和供应不合理的现象，只要当地党政领导部门对居民深入宣传教育，实事求是核订供应量，就可以降低粮食的消费。
    内蒙古自治区呼和浩特、包头、满洲里等十九个市镇自去年12月到今年3月上旬，已节约了粮食八十八万二千多斤。满洲里市开展了全市性的以节约粮食为主的食堂竞赛，使全市行业用粮显著减少。乌兰浩特市有四个居民委员会发动居民互相调剂粮食，就调剂出余粮一千四百多斤。
