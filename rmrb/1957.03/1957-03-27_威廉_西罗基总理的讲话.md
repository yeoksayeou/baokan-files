    Premier William Široký's Speech
    Dear friends and comrades!
    The people of Czechoslovakia have entrusted us to visit your great country at the invitation of the Government of the People's Republic of China, to work with the leaders of your People's Republic and with all of you to further deepen and develop our traditional friendly cooperation, to further strengthen the unity and strength of the socialist camp, and to promote the strengthening and consolidation of world peace; to learn from your experience and draw lessons from it to serve the socialist construction of Czechoslovakia. Now we are carrying out this important mission with real joy.
    In conversations with the leaders of the People's Republic of China and throughout our stay in your country, we have realized every day and every hour that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, are advancing firmly and bravely on the road to socialism. We recognize that the People's Republic of China is using all its strength to safeguard the unity of the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the further strengthening of its power, to safeguard the cause of freedom for all peoples, and the cause of peace and friendship among all peoples. Finally, we also recognize with joy that the Czechoslovak Republic sees in the great Chinese people its loyal friend. I believe that in today's relations between the Chinese and Czech peoples, your saying "as close as brothers" is entirely applicable.
    Our unforgettable President Gottwald once recounted with emotion his meeting with the Chinese people who had undergone decades of arduous and tenacious struggle. He emphasized: "I can tell you that they can be said to be golden people, and we must learn many things from these golden people. Such people are not easy to find except in the Soviet Union..." Dear friends, these words have been deeply confirmed to us in every place we have visited. Everything we have seen, heard, and felt in your country is indelibly imprinted in our hearts, and we will convey them to our people with excitement.
    We have seen the great remains of ancient Chinese culture. We admire the great and beautiful works created by the Chinese people hundreds or thousands of years ago, their skill and profound humanism. We have felt the rapid and powerful development of the People's Republic of China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. We have seen many modern enterprises already equipped with China's own products. We have seen the enthusiasm of the Chinese working class in ensuring the vigorous development of its own socialist country. In particular, the great movement of saving and economizing raw materials that is successfully carried out in your various enterprises is of particularly important significance for the further development of industrial production.
    We have witnessed with our own eyes the results of the earth-shaking and historic transformation of the Chinese countryside, which has bravely embarked on the path of widespread agricultural development through cooperative production.
    We have seen the rapid development of education in secondary schools and universities to train new cadres, and we have seen the comprehensive prosperity of cultural undertakings. We recognize that the Chinese Communist Party is very wisely solving the difficult problems of socialist transformation, the problems of ethnic minorities, and other problems. We have seen that the Chinese people are united in supporting their own people's government, their own Communist Party, and Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China.
    The Chinese people are the heirs of a glorious past, the embodiment of a great modern era in China, and the builders of an unprecedented future. Dear friends, this is you—the Chinese people, who, under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, have completely ended the rule of the thousand-year-old system of exploitation and established a new China where the people are masters for the first time, and a new China that is becoming increasingly prosperous and rich. Your People's China has stood up magnificently as a sovereign and independent country, and for the first time in its history, it is a unified country led by a central government. Your diligent hands, your enormous strength, your perseverance, and your competence are the guarantee that the People's Republic of China will grow into a powerful modern socialist industrial power in a short period of time.
    The cause you are building has great international significance because it involves a quarter of the world's population, because more than 600 million people are walking the path of socialism, and that is a force that can move the world. The socialist construction of the People's Republic of China means greatly strengthening the entire socialist camp, the cause of socialism, the freedom of all nations, and the forces of world peace. Your achievements are our achievements and the achievements of all progressive mankind. The rapid development of your industrial and agricultural production is constantly increasing the economic strength of the socialist camp. Every new factory you build, every step forward in industrial and agricultural production, every new step in China's socialist construction, is also a step in the victory of the socialist system over imperialism. The unity, determination, and resolve of the Chinese people are of world historical significance. With this unity, determination, and resolve, the Chinese people stand on the side of socialism, on the side of the unbreakable alliance with the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp, on the side of the just national liberation struggles of all nations, and on the side of peace and friendship among all peoples. Dear friends, comrades:
    During our stay in the People's Republic of China, we had a series of conversations with your leaders. The meetings with Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Zhou Enlai, Comrade Zhu De, and other comrades left a deep impression on us. All these conversations were conducted in a spirit of complete and principled unity on all issues.
    Such unity is completely unimaginable in the imperialist world. There, the principle of the big fish eating the small fish applies, and there is no unity where some people give orders and others only obey. However, fundamentally different principles apply among our socialist countries. Where the working class and the people have achieved rule, there is an atmosphere of friendship and unity. The principles that apply among us are: fraternal cooperation and mutual assistance, complete equality and mutual respect regardless of the size of the country or the size of the population, proletarian internationalism, and the common struggle for socialism, security, and peace. These principles unite the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union into an unbreakable whole, into a strong fortress, before which all the provocations and conspiracies of the forces of aggression are smashed to pieces.
    Indeed, this unity of the socialist countries is not liked by some gentlemen in the West, but this does not affect us. We are proud of this unity. This unity is the greatest achievement of all nations and the most important factor in the cause of progress, peace, and freedom throughout the world.
    In the current international conditions, further strengthening and consolidating the unity and cooperation between socialist countries is of particular importance. Recent events have shown that the aggressive forces of international imperialism do not want to learn lessons from their failed activities in Egypt and Hungary. They continue to carry out subversive provocations against socialist countries and engage in conspiracies and tricks against nationally independent countries and world peace. The hallmark of the development of the world situation is undoubtedly the further growth of the forces of progress and peace. However, to thwart all the plans of the imperialists and to ensure the peace and happiness of mankind, it is necessary for all peace-loving countries and peoples of the world to unite and work together against the conspiracies of the aggressors, to strive for peaceful coexistence between countries, and to strive for the relaxation of international tensions.
    The new proposals recently put forward by the Soviet Union on the issue of disarmament and cooperation among European countries are of great significance for the struggle of all nations to further ease international tensions. The path taken by Western countries is to strengthen armaments, continue to strengthen the power of aggressive military blocs, and they attempt to alienate countries, make them oppose each other, and establish divisive organizations in Europe that serve military purposes. The Soviet Union proposes that European countries embark on a path of common cooperation in developing the economy and using atomic energy for peaceful purposes. The Soviet Union proposes to resolutely embark on a common path of gradually reducing armaments. It is necessary to immediately stop the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, gradually achieve the complete elimination of such weapons, and fundamentally eliminate the threat of a new war. This goal is fully in the interests of all nations. Therefore, Czechoslovakia, like the People's Republic of China, fully supports the new great peace initiative put forward by the Soviet Union.
    The People's Republic of China and the Czechoslovak Republic are staunch fighters for peace and friendship among all nations, and for the freedom of all nations. The Czechoslovak people highly value the People's Republic of China's great contribution to the cause of socialism, highly value its contribution to the unity of the socialist camp, to the cause of peace and freedom in Asia and the world, to the development of the vast peaceful regions of the world, and to the establishment of ties between peace-loving countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
    Our two countries fully support the just struggle of Asian, African, and Latin American countries for national independence and security, and we will strengthen friendly cooperation with these countries on the basis of the famous Five Principles. We advocate peaceful coexistence with all countries with different social systems.
    However, we will be vigilant against all the conspiracies and tricks of the imperialists. Together with all socialist countries and other peace-loving countries, we will repel all attempts by the imperialists to undermine the peaceful labor of the people.
    Long live the struggle of the people of all countries for peace and friendship!
    May the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union continue to be strengthened!
    Long live the eternal friendship between Czechoslovakia and China!

### 威廉·西罗基总理的讲话

专栏：

    威廉·西罗基总理的讲话亲爱的朋友们，同志们！
    捷克斯洛伐克人民委托我们应中华人民共和国政府的邀请来访问你们伟大的国家，委托我们同你们人民共和国的领导人以及同你们大家一起来促进我们传统的友好合作获得进一步加深和发展，来进一步加强社会主义阵营的团结和力量，来促进世界和平的加强和巩固；委托我们来了解你们的经验，并从中汲取教益以服务于捷克斯洛伐克的社会主义建设。现在我们正怀着真正欢欣的心情执行着这一重要的使命。
    在同中华人民共和国领导人的谈话中和我们在贵国逗留的整个时期中，每天每时都使我们认识到，在光荣的中国共产党的领导下中国人民正在社会主义的道路上坚定勇敢地前进。我们认识到，中华人民共和国是以其全部力量来维护以苏联为首的伟大社会主义阵营的团结事业及其威力的进一步加强，维护各国人民自由的事业，各国人民间和平友好的事业。最后我们并以欢欣的心情认识到，捷克斯洛伐克共和国从伟大的中国人民中间看到自己忠实的好友。我以为，在今天中捷人民的关系中，你们的俗话“亲如手足”是完全适用的。
    我们永远难忘的总统哥特瓦尔德同志曾经以激动的心情叙述过他和经历数十年艰苦顽强斗争的中国人民的会见。他强调说：“我可以对你们说，他们可以说是黄金般的人，从这些黄金般的人们那里我们必须学习许多东西。这样的人除了在苏联我们是不容易找得到的。……”亲爱的朋友们，在我们所到的各个地方都深深地向我们证实了这些话的深刻真实性。我们在你们国家里所看到的，所听到的，以及所感觉到的一切，都不可磨灭地刻印在我们的心里，我们将以兴奋的心情把它们转告给我们的人民。
    我们看过了古老中国文化的伟大遗迹。我们欣赏了中国人民在数百年或数千年之前所创造的伟大的美丽作品，他们的技巧和深刻的人道精神。我们感受到了中华人民共和国在中国共产党的领导下所取得的迅速和强大的发展。我们看到了已经有不少以中国自己的产品所装备起来的现代化企业。我们看到了中国工人阶级为保证本国社会主义的有力发展而发挥的热情。特别是在你们各个企业中所顺利开展的节约和节省原材料的伟大运动，对工业生产的进一步发展有着特别重要的意义。
    我们亲眼见到中国农村经过翻天复地的有历史意义的转变的成果，中国农村通过合作化生产的道路勇敢地走上了广泛发展农业的途径。
    我们看到了中等学校和高等学校培养新干部的教育事业的迅速发展，我们看到了文化事业的全面繁荣。我们认识到中国共产党非常英明地解决着社会主义改造的困难问题、少数民族问题以及其他一些问题。我们看到中国人民团结一致地拥护自己的人民政府、自己的共产党和中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志。
    中国人民是光荣过去的继承人，是伟大中国现代时期的体现者，和空前的未来的建设者。亲爱的朋友们，这就是你们——中国人民，你们在光荣的中国共产党领导之下已彻底地结束了千年来剥削制度的统治，并建立了由人民第一次当家作主人的新中国、日益美好富饶的新中国。你们的人民中国已经作为一个主权的、独立的国家伟大地站起来了，她在自己的历史上第一次是一个统一的、并由一个中央来领导的国家。你们勤劳的双手，你们巨大的力量，你们的坚毅和能干，是中华人民共和国在短期内将成长为一个强大的现代社会主义工业大国的保证。
    你们正在建设的事业之所以有着巨大的国际意义，是因为参加这一建设的是全人类四分之一的人口，是因为有六亿多人民走着社会主义的道路，而这就是能够推动世界的力量。中华人民共和国的社会主义建设意味着大大地加强整个社会主义阵营，社会主义事业，各民族的自由和全世界的和平力量。你们的成就就是我们的成就，也是整个进步人类的成就。你们工农业生产的迅速发展日益提高着社会主义阵营的经济力量，你们每建设一个新工厂，工农业生产上的每提高一步，中国社会主义建设的每一个新的步骤，都同时是社会主义社会制度战胜帝国主义的步骤。中国人民的团结、坚定和决心，是有着世界历史意义的。中国人民就以这种团结、坚定和决心，站在社会主义，站在同苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家的牢不可破的联盟这一边，站在各民族的、正义的民族解放斗争这一边，站在和平和各国人民间的友好这一边。亲爱的朋友们，同志们：
    在中华人民共和国逗留的期间，我们同你们的领导人进行了一系列的交谈。同毛泽东同志、周恩来同志、朱德同志及其他同志的会见给我们留下了深刻的印象。所有这些交谈都是在标志着一切问题上完全的和原则性的团结一致的精神下进行的。
    在帝国主义世界里这样的团结一致是完全不可想像的。在它们那里是适用着大鱼吃小鱼的原则，在一些人发号施令而另一些人只是听从的地方是谈不到团结一致的。但是，在我们社会主义国家中间都是适用着根本不同的原则。在工人阶级和人民实现统治的地方是充满着友好和团结的。在我们中间适用的原则是：兄弟般的合作和相互的援助，彼此间不分国家大小和人口多少的完全平等和互相尊重，无产阶级的国际主义，争取社会主义、安全和和平的共同斗争。这些原则把以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国联结成为一个牢不可破的整体，联结成为一个坚强的堡垒，在这一堡垒的面前一切侵略势力的挑衅和阴谋活动都碰得头破血流。
    的确，社会主义国家的这种团结是西方的一些先生们所不喜欢的，但这点并不影响我们。我们为这一团结而感到自豪。这种团结是各国人民最伟大的成果，是全世界进步、和平和自由事业中的最重要的因素。
    在目前的国际条件下，进一步加强和巩固社会主义各国间的团结和合作具有着特别重要的意义。最近时期的事件表明：国际帝国主义的侵略势力并不想从它们在埃及和匈牙利的失败活动中汲取教训。它们继续对社会主义国家进行颠复挑衅活动，对民族独立国家和世界和平从事阴谋诡计活动。世界形势发展的标志无疑是进步和和平力量的进一步增长。但是，要使帝国主义者的一切计划失败，使人类的和平和幸福获得保证，就必须使全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民联合起来，共同致力于反对侵略者的阴谋，争取各国间的和平共处，争取国际紧张局势的缓和。
    苏联对裁军问题和欧洲各国合作问题最近所提出的新建议，对各民族争取进一步和缓国际紧张局势的斗争有着巨大的意义。西方国家所走的道路是加强军备、继续加强侵略性军事集团的力量，他们企图离间各国，使他们互相对立，并在欧洲建立服务于军事目的的分裂性组织。苏联建议欧洲各国在发展经济和和平使用原子能上都走上共同合作的道路。苏联建议坚决地走上逐步裁减军备的共同的道路。有必要立即停止原子和氢武器的试验，逐步达到完全消灭这种武器，并根本地消除新战争的威胁。这种目标是完全符合于各民族的利益的。因此，捷克斯洛伐克和中华人民共和国一样，完全支持苏联所提出的新的伟大和平倡议。
    中华人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国是争取和平与各民族友好，以及争取各民族自由的坚决战士。捷克斯洛伐克人民极为珍视中华人民共和国对社会主义事业的伟大贡献，极为珍视她对社会主义阵营的团结，对亚洲和全世界的和平自由事业，对世界广大和平地区的发展，对爱好和平的各国在和平共处五项原则的基础上建立联系所作的伟大贡献。
    我们两国完全支持亚非和拉丁美洲各国争取和保障民族独立的正义斗争，我们将和这些国家在著名的五项原则基础上加强友好合作。我们拥护同社会制度不同的一切国家和平共处。
    但是，我们将警惕帝国主义分子的一切阴谋和诡计。同所有的社会主义国家以及其他的爱好和平的各国一起，我们将击退帝国主义者破坏人民和平劳动的一切企图。
    各国人民争取和平和友谊的斗争万岁！
    让以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义阵营继续获得加强！
    捷中永恒的友谊万岁！
