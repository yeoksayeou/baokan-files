The cooperative system possesses great superiority in Henan Province.

I fully endorse Chairman Mao Zedong's instructions at the Supreme State Conference and Premier Zhou Enlai's political report. I also fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the conference and the summary report on the work of the short-term training class for industrialists and businessmen.

Now, as a staff member of Henan Province, I would like to express the following opinions based on what I have personally seen in the rural areas of Henan.

Henan Province achieved advanced agricultural cooperativization in the first half of 1956. There are 26,211 advanced cooperatives in the province, with 98.1% of farm households joining the advanced cooperatives. The first year of advanced cooperativization, after the test of the Great Production Movement and severe natural disasters, has fully demonstrated its great superiority and has laid a solid foundation.

Last year, Henan suffered the most serious natural disasters since liberation, but grain and cotton production still increased compared to the previous year.

The superiority of advanced agricultural cooperativization and its great vitality are manifested in: achieving increased agricultural production in the face of severe natural disasters. Last year, our province suffered the most serious natural disasters since liberation, but the total output of grain and cotton in the province still increased compared to the bumper year of 1955. More than 40 counties (suburban areas of cities) in the province increased production by more than 10% compared to 1955, some counties such as Yanshi County and Mengjin County increased production by more than 40%; some counties such as Luoshan County and Shangcheng County increased production by more than 30%; Gong County's grain production increased by 21.4% compared to 1955, changing from a grain-deficient county to a grain-surplus county. In the past, it needed the state to supply more than 5 million jin of grain, but in 1956 it sold more than 10 million jin of surplus grain to the state. In Jiyuan County, the number of households with increased income has reached 91.8% of the total number of cooperative members' households. According to a survey of 114 typical cooperatives (including 25 disaster-stricken cooperatives) in the province, agricultural production increased by 10.35% in 1956 compared to 1955. In non-disaster areas, more than 80% of agricultural cooperatives achieved increased agricultural production, of which about 80% increased production by more than 10%, and some cooperatives achieved a bumper harvest. Although Xinxiang Prefecture suffered a particularly severe wind and rain disaster in 1956, the total income of the 1,501 advanced cooperatives in the area still increased by 14% compared to 1955, of which agricultural income increased by 12% and sideline income increased by 78%. According to a survey of 5,785 cooperatives, those with an increase of less than 10% accounted for 23.35%, those with an increase of 10-20% accounted for 40.17%, those with an increase of 20-30% accounted for 25.41%, those with an increase of 30-40% accounted for 7.87%, and those with an increase of 40-100% accounted for 3.2%. The Xuguang Cooperative in Mengjin County increased production by 101%. The average yield per mu of grain in Xin County and the suburbs of Xinyang City reached 500 jin; the average yield per mu of grain in Shangcheng County, Meng County, and Jia County reached 450 jin; and there were 1,879 mu of grain crops in Dengfeng County with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu. There are more than 100,000 mu of cotton in the province with a yield of more than 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. The total cotton output of the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Lingbao County increased by 114.2% compared to 1955. The sideline production in the second half of 1956 has been greatly restored and developed. In many areas, the sideline income has also increased compared to 1955. According to a survey of 247 typical cooperatives, sideline income increased by 28.1% in 1956 compared to 1955. The most important factor for the advanced cooperatives to achieve increased production is the high degree of enthusiasm and creativity shown by the masses under the encouragement of the socialist upsurge. In some places, people delivered manure and weeded with lanterns at night. The labor attendance rate of advanced cooperatives is generally 20%-30% higher than in the past, and the labor attendance rate of women is more than 40% higher than in the past, and in some places the attendance rate reaches 99%. In the production process, many rationalization proposals and new creations of the members were adopted, many advanced experiences were promoted, and a large number of advanced figures emerged. The advanced cooperatives adopted various measures to increase production, so that the potential of the land could be universally utilized. The peasants said: "In the past, the land was a single red flower, but now the land is full of flowers." The members of the Xinghuo Cooperative in Mengjin County praised the superiority of the advanced cooperative: "Joining the advanced cooperative means 'three worries free' (no worries about food, clothing, or fuel), 'four fears not' (not afraid of disaster, not afraid of being alone and helpless, not afraid of temporary difficulties, not afraid of infectious diseases), 'five mores' (more production, more surplus grain sales, more sideline production, more fertilizer accumulation, more pig and rabbit breeding), and 'six changes' (the rough become meticulous, dry land becomes paddy field, grain-deficient becomes grain-surplus, coarse cloth becomes fine cloth, barefoot becomes wearing rubber shoes, using lanterns becomes using flashlights)." After the increase in production, public accumulation also increased. According to a typical survey of 89 non-disaster-stricken cooperatives in the province, the average public accumulation increased by 7,300 yuan per cooperative in 1956.

	Large-scale implementation of technological reforms,
	Remarkable achievements in farmland water conservancy construction.

Manifested in: the possibility of unprecedented large-scale implementation of technological reforms. Among the ten measures to increase production implemented in our province last year, the most prominent achievement was the mass "water conservancy" movement. 1,043,716 wells were dug throughout the province, 22,660 springs were tapped, 1,321 small reservoirs were built, 434,955 ponds, weirs, and dams were built, and 19,716 small canals were built. Irrigation equipment was increased by 27.5 million mu, which promoted agricultural production. For example, the "March 8th" Agricultural Cooperative in Wuzhuang Township, Nanyang County, is an unremarkable advanced cooperative with 352 households. The cooperative has 6,511 mu of land, of which 4,500 mu are black land, lake depressions, and submerged land with poor soil that is difficult to cultivate, and often nine out of ten crops fail to yield. After cooperativization, in the spirit of combining storage and drainage, water conservancy construction was carried out according to local conditions, wells were dug, and water storage ditches, reservoirs, and drainage canals were built, saving 1,600 mu of land. The total output value of grain, cotton, and sesame alone increased by 101% compared to 1955, which was impossible in the years of individual farming and primary cooperatives. The manure accumulation movement has been greatly developed, and the amount of manure accumulated in the province has doubled compared to 1955; the quality of manure accumulation has also been greatly improved, and the situation of declining pig breeding has been basically reversed, with 650,000 more pigs raised than in 1955. Some counties, such as Xiping County, raised 3.2 times more pigs than in 1955, and some counties, such as Jiyuan, Meng County, Fengqiu, and Qinyang, raised more than twice as many. The Puyang County United Agricultural Cooperative, with more than 400 households, raised 3,313 pigs, an average of eight pigs per household and two pigs per person, more than four times more than in 1955. The cooperative's income from selling pigs alone averaged 73.5 yuan per household. The planting area of high-yield crops has been expanded; rational close planting has been implemented; technical guidance on cotton field management has been universally strengthened; technical training for low-yield cotton areas has been strengthened; the area of improved varieties of various crops in the province in 1956 increased by 29.46 million mu compared to 1955; the multiple cropping area increased by 3.6% compared to 1955; the area for prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests increased by 55% compared to 1955; a special meeting was held in mountainous areas to determine the policy of comprehensive development of the mountain economy, changing the general leadership methods; the area of soil erosion control was 5,335 square kilometers, and 4.22 million mu of afforestation was carried out.

	The ability to resist natural disasters has been greatly enhanced, and the masses generally reflected: "With cooperativization, there is nothing to fear."

Manifested in: Compared to previous years, the ability to resist natural disasters has increased to an incomparable degree. From June to August 1956, our province suffered four consecutive attacks of rainstorms and floods. The rainfall was heavy, the rain was strong, the scope was wide, and the duration was long. Due to the sharp rise in floods in several river systems, although all localities were fully mobilized and carried out an intense flood prevention and rescue struggle, many river channels still overflowed and breached. Coupled with the typhoon attack, it formed the most serious disaster in our province since liberation. The disaster-stricken area in summer and autumn in the province reached more than 50 million mu, more than 1.9 million houses collapsed, and the disaster-stricken areas involved 63 counties and cities (not including those with less than 300,000 mu of disaster). Among them, there were 7 severely disaster-stricken counties, 32 heavily disaster-stricken counties, and 24 lightly disaster-stricken counties. More than 6,000 advanced cooperatives were affected, including 12 million people in the disaster area. However, with the realization of advanced agricultural cooperativization, and because the Party and government at all levels strengthened the leadership of production and disaster relief work, a responsibility system of layered division of responsibility was universally implemented in the disaster areas of the province. A large number of cadres were transferred, carrying forward the style of hard work and simple living, sharing weal and woe with the masses, going deep into the disaster-stricken cooperatives and households to conduct investigations and assistance, and fully mobilizing the masses, relying on agricultural cooperatives, carrying out a production self-rescue movement, carrying out replanting, supplementary planting, and developing a variety of production avenues, so that the production order and the lives of the victims in the disaster areas were stabilized. A total of 7.53 million mu of late autumn crops were replanted in the disaster areas, yielding 29.5 million jin of grain, 300 million jin of sweet potatoes, and 8.2 billion jin of vegetables; with the support of the state and the help of the cooperatives, more than 600,000 houses had been repaired before the year; more than 800,000 pieces of winter clothing were distributed; about 50% of the labor force participated in sideline production, earning more than 60 million yuan in the five months after autumn. According to statistics in January, 1,331 disaster-stricken cooperatives in the province had eliminated the disaster, and 1,332 disaster-stricken cooperatives eliminated the disaster before the Spring Festival. That is to say, before the Spring Festival, 41.6% of the disaster-stricken cooperatives in the province had eliminated the disaster. At the end of 1956, Anyang Prefecture had completed 68% of the task of eliminating the disaster. Tangyin County had completed 97.8% of the task of eliminating the disaster. The "Lighthouse" Cooperative in Chengguan Township, Neihuang County, is a large cooperative with 1,601 households, with 12,804 mu of submerged land, accounting for 83% of the cultivated area, a 91% reduction in crop production, and 986 collapsed houses. However, since the launch of the production self-rescue movement in July, in the five months to January 20, the income from sideline production plus the annual agricultural and sideline income increased by 21.6% compared to 1955. Of the 1,601 disaster-stricken households in the cooperative, 50.3% had completely eliminated the disaster or had a surplus, and 49.7% had eliminated 70%-80% of the disaster. Compared with the agricultural and sideline income of the 513 disaster-stricken agricultural cooperatives in Xinxiang Prefecture in the same period last year, there were 90 cooperatives where more than 90% of the members increased their income; 124 cooperatives where more than 70% of the members increased their income; and 293 cooperatives where about 50% of the members increased their income. Basically, there were no phenomena of fleeing famine, begging for food, or theft. This phenomenon did not exist in the disaster years in the past. The vast number of cooperative members in the disaster area said with emotion: "If it weren't for the cooperative, half of the cattle would have died and half would have been sold, and half of the people would have fled the famine." They generally reflected: "With cooperativization, there is nothing to fear." The production and disaster relief movement in our province since last autumn is the most mass movement with the most abundant experience in production self-rescue in recent years. It has fundamentally changed the old road of bankruptcy and disaster relief, and the laboring peasants of all strata have received a profound education in collectivism. We are currently continuing our efforts to eliminate the disaster before the spring plowing to ensure spring plowing production.

	The vast number of peasants have increased their income, and their economic and cultural lives have undergone great changes.

Manifested in: The lives of the peasants have improved. According to a survey of 89 typical cooperatives in non-disaster areas (including 16 cooperatives with reduced production), 68.44% of the cooperative members' households increased their income compared to 1955, 2.64% maintained their income in 1955, and 28.92% decreased their income compared to 1955; the average income per person in 1955 was 48.1 yuan, and the average income per person in 1956 increased to 55.6 yuan, an increase of 15.59% compared to 1955. In Xinxiang Prefecture, where the disaster was more serious, an average of 66.8% of the members increased their income, of which 86.8% of the members in non-disaster areas increased their income; 73.6% of the members in lightly disaster-stricken areas increased their income, and 59.3% of the members in heavily disaster-stricken areas also increased their income. From the results of the distribution of agricultural production cooperatives in 1956, each workday generally averaged about 7 jiao, some cooperatives averaged about 1.5 yuan, and the most averaged about 2.5 yuan. In non-disaster areas, except for the "Five Guarantees" households, the actual per capita food ration is generally more than 400 jin, and some eat 500 jin to 700 jin. According to a survey of 19 cooperatives in Anyang Prefecture, the average living expenses per member in 1956 were 57.59 yuan, an increase of 20.1% compared to 1955. The proportions of several major consumer goods that increased are: grain 11.6%, clothing 74.4%, cotton 5.5%, salt 8.3%, and edible oil 10.2%. Some cooperatives had an average living standard of 101 yuan per person in 1956, an increase of 47 yuan compared to 1955. The "Peace" Cooperative in Huaxian County increased production in every household. In 1956, the cooperative, with 107 households, purchased more than 4,000 chi of various colors of foreign cloth and invested more than 2,000 yuan in the cooperative. Twenty-five people put on new overcoats, 56 people put on new woolen clothes, 80 households purchased thermos bottles, and more than 30 households built new houses. In addition, 40 new quilts, two sets of fur coats, and seven bicycles were made. The members happily sang in the fields, "The Communist Party has a high method, the socialist road is good," "Chairman Mao leads the cooperativization, no longer eat powder residue all year round, eating, drinking, and wearing are not afraid, and strive to produce and support industrialization." Some reflected: "The land reform turned over, and the cooperativization rooted in wealth."

	There have also been great changes in the cultural life of the peasants: the number of students in civilian schools in the province increased from 5 million in 1955 to 8.43 million, and 1.35 million people graduated from literacy classes in 1956, equivalent to 160% of the total number of literacy graduates in the past five years; 103 counties have established wired broadcasting; 6,215 rural libraries, 18,989 rural clubs, and 12,683 rural amateur drama troupes have been established; 10,103 new township health centers, stations, offices, and midwifery stations have been built, and 190,000 health workers and midwives have been trained; 18,265 rural nurseries have been established. The development of middle and primary schools in the province is also very rapid. In 1956, the number of high school students increased from 29,263 to 43,898, an increase of 50%; the number of junior high school students increased from 211,108 to 268,114, an increase of 27%; the number of primary school students increased from 4,428,302 to 4,890,924, an increase of 10%; the number of middle schools and normal schools increased from 346 to 507 (excluding 387 junior high school classes attached to senior primary schools), an increase of 46.5%. This meets the urgent needs of the vast number of people. It is precisely because the development of school education is fast that there are problems such as insufficient school buildings and simple equipment, but these are problems in progress and are brought about by the good phenomenon of the development of the cause. In the great development of education, the students' enthusiasm for learning is also very high. For example, some bring steamed buns to school and actively participate in production when they return home.

	The help of the state and the working class to the peasants of Henan is huge.

In order to help agricultural cooperatives increase production and enable members to increase their income, the state and the working class gave the peasants huge support. In 1956, the state issued various agricultural loans of 246.92 million yuan in our province, issued relief funds of 28.78 million yuan, and invested a total of 115.6 million yuan in the Yellow River maintenance and flood control and the Huai River control. In one year, 98,200 double-furrow plows, 23,344 walking plows, 1,456 horse-drawn harvesters, 170,000 waterwheels, 51,023 sprayers and dusters, and 24,284 other new-style agricultural implements were promoted. How much money did the state ask the peasants for? Agricultural tax (including public grain, assigned cotton, cash substitutes, and all local surcharges) totaled 243.71 million yuan (of which public grain accounted for 9.34% of the total grain output), only equivalent to 88.4% of the total amount of loans and relief funds.

In addition, the vast number of rural grassroots cadres in the province, due to their diligent work, absorbed lessons, increased their talents, and were tempered in the process of doing things. They have a high enthusiasm for work and have a close relationship with the masses. In one year, they jumped from leading a few households or dozens of households in mutual aid groups and primary cooperatives to leading hundreds or thousands of households in advanced cooperatives. They learned while doing, overcame many difficulties, and made agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production achieve great victories rapidly. This is also a great achievement in our rural work.

	Shortcomings in the work

Of course, there are many shortcomings in our work. The main shortcomings in running cooperatives are: in the spring of last year, there was a period of insufficient attention to sideline production; some cooperatives invested too much in agricultural infrastructure construction; and there was some subjectivism in promoting advanced technical measures. These have been corrected. Some cooperatives have some problems in management systems and income distribution, which are being corrected. Secondly, some cadres lack correct analysis and understanding of the new changes and new situation in the countryside after advanced cooperativization, the ideological consciousness of the people lagging behind the changes in production relations, and the ideological education of peasants and the cultivation of collective labor habits being still long-term and arduous, resulting in the relaxation of political and ideological work and the neglect of the implementation of the class line; and for the class enemies, some cadres and the masses have produced new麻痹 ideological and relaxed dictatorship. Thirdly, among some rural grassroots cadres, some cadres do not have enough democratic style and have varying degrees of coercive command style. Of course, the reasons for these shortcomings are various. Some shortcomings are caused by subjectivism and bureaucracy; some shortcomings are unavoidable in the early stage of running cooperatives due to lack of experience, heavy and urgent tasks, and incomplete various systems; some shortcomings are due to the limitations of the cadres' ideological level and need to be corrected through continuous education and improvement in their work. As for those who mentioned elements who stand on the heads of the masses and act in a domineering manner, that is only individual.

Due to the existence of the above-mentioned shortcomings and errors, there were also problems of闹社 in individual places. For example, in Linru County, due to weak political work, poor and untimely handling of income distribution issues, and insufficient implementation of the voluntary and mutually beneficial policy and the democratic cooperative management policy, coupled with the sabotage of bad elements, incidents of trouble-making occurred in more than 30 cooperatives in the autumn of last year. But after work, it was quickly resolved.

In terms of school education, precisely because the development is a bit faster, the school equipment is insufficient, and many tasks cannot keep up, such as weak political leadership in schools, poor political and ideological education, and insufficient concern for students' lives. These are all issues that we need to further study and solve and improve in the future.

	Strive to enable all peasants in the province to reach the income level of prosperous middle peasants in about three years.

In short, the achievements of the first year of advanced agricultural cooperativization in our province are very great, and great changes have taken place in all aspects. But it is not like what some people have mentioned that there are only shortcomings and no advantages. I personally believe that we should enthusiastically face up to the fact that the achievements are the main ones. Of course, there are shortcomings in the work, but the shortcomings are secondary and are unavoidable phenomena in the new situation. On the basis of the victory in 1956, according to the instructions of the CPC Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the State Council to "do everything possible and try every means to strive for a bumper harvest this year," we have formulated the policy, tasks, and measures to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year. We must further consolidate and improve agricultural production cooperatives from all aspects, give full play to the superiority of the socialist collective agricultural economy, implement the provisions of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), and comprehensively develop the agricultural economy with grain and cotton as the main products. And if there is no particularly large disaster, we must strive to enable the members of all agricultural production cooperatives in the province to basically reach or exceed the income level of ordinary prosperous farmers in about three years. In order to complete the above glorious tasks, we must put political work in the first place, further consolidate collective ownership ideologically, continue to vigorously carry out propaganda and education centered on mobilizing large-scale production, mobilize all positive forces, and devote ourselves to the large-scale production movement to consolidate cooperatives and strive for a bumper agricultural harvest; conscientiously implement the policy of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily and democratically, improve the management level of agricultural cooperatives; actively build water conservancy projects, strengthen wheat field management, vigorously develop pig breeding and fertilizer accumulation, protect and breed livestock, promote new-style agricultural implements and advanced technologies, and develop various economic measures to increase production; closely contact the masses, strengthen in-depth investigation and research, mobilize members to carry out rationalization proposals, and further educate and improve cadres' thinking of hard work and simple living and sharing weal and woe with the masses.

Under the wise leadership and encouragement of the great Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we are full of confidence in launching a broader and more down-to-earth large-scale production movement in our province than last year, striving for a bumper agricultural harvest this year, and making the face of the countryside move towards the direction of common prosperity year by year.

专栏：

    合作化制度在河南省的巨大优越性
    刘鸿文的发言
    我完全拥护毛泽东主席在最高国务会议上的指示和周恩来总理的政治报告。并完全同意陈叔通副主席的会务工作和关于工商业者短期讲习班的工作总结报告。
    现在我以河南省工作人员之一的身份，根据亲眼所见河南农村情况发表如下意见。
    河南省是1956年的上半年实现了高级农业合作化，全省有高级社二万六千二百一十一个，入高级社的农户占总农户的98.1％。高级合作化的第一年，经过大生产运动和严重的自然灾害的考验，已充分证明了它的巨大的优越性，并且已经奠定了巩固的基础。
    去年河南遭到解放以来最严重的自然灾害，但是粮棉产量仍比前年增加
    高级农业合作化的优越性及其伟大的生命力，表现于：在严重的自然灾害的袭击下，取得了农业的增产。去年我省遭受了解放以来最严重的自然灾害，但是全省粮食和棉花总产量是仍比丰收的1955年增产了。全省有四十多个县（市郊）比1955年增产10％以上，其中有的县如偃师县、孟津县增产40％以上；有的县如罗山县、商城县增产30％以上；巩县粮食比1955年增产21.4％，由缺粮县一变而为余粮县，往年需要国家供应粮食五百多万斤，1956年卖给国家余粮一千多万斤。济源县全县增加收入的户数已达到社员总户数的91.8％。据全省选择的一百一十四个典型社（其中二十五个灾社）调查，1956年比1955年农业增产10.35％。在非灾区有80％以上的农业社获得农业增产，其中80％左右的社增产在一成以上，有的社获得了大丰收。新乡专区1956年虽然遭受了特大的风灾和雨灾，但全区一千五百零一个高级社的总收入仍比1955年增加14％，其中农业收入增加12％，副业收入增加78％。据五千七百八十五个社的调查，增产一成以下的占23.35％，增产一——二成的占40.17％，增产二——三成的占25.41％，增产三——四成的占7.87％，增产四——十成的占3.2％。孟津县旭光社增产101％。新县、信阳市郊粮食平均每亩产量达到五百斤；商城县、孟县、郏县粮食平均每亩产量达到四百五十斤；登封县粮食作物有一千八百七十九亩亩产千斤以上。全省有十余万亩棉花，亩产皮棉达一百斤以上。灵宝县五星农业社棉花总产量比1955年增产114.2％。1956年下半年的副业生产有了很大恢复和发展，在不少地区，副业收入比1955年也有增加。据二百四十七个典型社调查，1956年比1955年增加副业收入28.1％。高级社所以能获得增产，最主要的因素是在社会主义高潮的鼓舞下，广大群众表现出来的高度积极性和创造性，有些地方点着灯送粪、拔草。高级社的劳动出勤率一般都比过去提高20％——30％，妇女劳动出勤率则比过去提高40％以上，有的地方出勤率达到99％。在生产过程中采纳了社员许多合理化建议和新创造，推广了许多先进经验，涌现了大量先进人物。高级社采用了各项增产措施，使土地的潜力有可能开始普遍利用。农民说：“过去土地是红花一朵，现在土地是遍地开花”。孟津县星火社社员们赞扬高级社的优越性：“入了高级社是‘三不愁’（不愁吃、不愁穿、不愁烧）、
  ‘四不怕’（不怕灾害侵袭、不怕孤寡无依靠、不怕临时发生困难、不怕疾病传染）、
  ‘五多’（增产多、卖余粮多、搞副业多、积肥施肥多、养猪养兔多）、‘六变化’（老粗变老细、旱田变水地、缺粮变余粮、穿粗布变成穿细布、赤脚变成穿胶鞋、使灯笼变成用电筒）。”在增产之后，又增加了公共积累。据全省八十九个非灾社的典型调查，1956年平均每社增加公共积累七千三百元。
      大规模推行技术改革中，
  兴修农田水利成绩卓著
    表现于：有可能空前大规模地推行技术改革。去年我省执行增产十大措施中，成绩最突出的是群众性的“水利化”运动，全省打井一百零四万三千七百一十六眼，下泉二万二千六百六十眼，修小型水库一千三百二十一座，修塘、堰、坝四十三万四千九百五十五处，修小型渠道一万九千七百一十六条。增加了二千七百五十万亩的灌溉设备，促进了农业的增产。如南阳县吴庄乡“三八”农业社，是一个三百五十二户的不著名的高级社，全社有土地六千五百一十一亩，土质坏不易耕作的黑土地、湖洼地、上浸地就有四千五百亩，常年是十种九不收。合作化后本着蓄泄兼护的精神，因地制宜地进行了水利建设，打井和修储水沟、蓄水池、排水渠，救出土地一千六百亩，仅粮食、棉花、芝麻三项总产值就较1955年增产101％，这是过去单干和初级社时期多年办不到的。积肥运动有很大开展，全省积肥量比1955年增加一倍；积肥质量亦有很大提高，并且基本上扭转了养猪减少的局面，比1955年增加养猪六十五万头。有的县如西平县养猪比1955年增加了三点二倍，有的县如济源、孟县、封丘、沁阳等增加一倍以上。濮阳县联营农业社，全社四百多户，养猪三千三百一十三头，每户平均养八头，每人平均养二头，较1955年增加四倍以上，全社仅卖猪收入每户平均七十三点五元。高产作物扩大了种植面积；实行了合理密植；普遍加强了对棉田管理的技术指导，加强了对棉花低产区的技术传授；全省1956年各种作物的良种面积比1955年扩大了二千九百四十六万亩；复种面积比1955年增加3.6％；防治病虫害面积比1955年增加55％；召开了山区的专门会议，确定了全面发展山区经济的方针，改变了一般化的领导方法；控制水土流失面积五千三百三十五平方公里，造林四百二十二万亩。
    抵抗自然灾害的力量大为增强，群众普遍反映：“有了合作化，什么都不怕”
    表现于：以不可比拟的程度，比往年增加了抵抗自然灾害的力量。1956年6月至8月间，我省连续遭受四次暴风雨和洪水的袭击。雨量大，雨势猛，范围广，持续时间长。由于几个河系洪水猛涨，虽经各地全力动员，紧张地进行了防汛抢险斗争，仍有不少河道漫溢、溃决，加之兼受台风袭击，形成我省解放以来最严重的灾害。全省夏、秋季受灾面积达五千多万亩，倒塌房屋一百九十余万间，受灾地区涉及六十三个县、市（成灾三十万亩以下的未计在内），占全省所属县份的二分之一。其中特重灾县七个，重灾县三十二个，轻灾县二十四个。成灾高级社六千余个，包括一千二百万人口的灾区。但是在实现了高级农业合作化的情况下，并由于各级党、政加强了对生产救灾工作的领导，在全省灾区普遍推行了层层分片包干负责的责任制，抽调大批干部，发扬艰苦朴素、与群众同甘共苦的作风，深入灾社灾户进行查访帮助，并充分发动群众，依靠农业社，开展生产自救运动，进行抢种、补种，开展多种生产门路，使灾区生产秩序和灾民生活得到了稳定。计灾区补种晚秋七百五十三万亩，收获粮食二万九千五百万斤，红薯三亿斤，蔬菜八十二亿斤；在国家扶持和合作社帮助下，年前已修复房屋六十余万间；发放寒衣八十余万件；有50％左右的劳动力参加了副业生产，秋后五个月共收入六千余万元。据1月份统计，全省已有一千三百三十一个灾社消灭了灾荒，有一千三百三十二个灾社在春节前消灭灾荒。这就是说，在春节之前，全省已有41.6％的灾社把灾荒消灭。安阳专区在1956年底，已完成消灭灾荒任务的68％。汤阴县已完成消灭灾荒任务的97.8％。内黄县城关乡“灯塔”社是一千六百零一户的大社，淹没土地一万二千八百零四亩，占耕地面积的83％，农作物减产91％，倒塌房屋九百八十六间，但自7月份开展生产自救运动五个月以来，至1月20日止，所得的副业收益加上全年农副业收入比1955年还增加21.6％，全社一千六百零一户灾户，已全部消灭灾荒或有余的占总户数50.3％，消灭70％—80％的占总户数49.7％。新乡专区五百一十三个遭灾的农业社和去年同期的农、副业收入相比，90％以上社员增加收入的有九十个社；70％以上社员增加收入的一百二十四个社；50％左右社员增加收入的有二百九十三个社。基本上没有发生逃荒、要饭、盗窃现象，这种现象是过去灾荒年景所没有的。灾区广大社员感动的说：“要不是合作社，牛得死一半，卖一半，人得逃荒走一半。”普遍反映：“有了合作化，什么都不怕。”去秋以来我省的生产救灾运动，是历年来生产自救经验最丰富的群众运动，它从根本上改变了破产渡荒的老道路，使各阶层劳动农民都受到了深刻的集体主义的教育。目前正在继续努力，把灾荒消灭在春耕之前，保证春耕生产。
    广大农民增加了收入，经济和文化生活都发生了很大的变化
    表现于：农民的生活有所改善。据非灾区八十九个典型社（其中有十六个减产社）的调查，入社农户中有68.44％比1955年增加了收入，有2.64％保持了1955年的收入，有28.92％比1955年减少了收入；1955年每人平均收入为四十八点一元，1956年每人平均收入增加到五十五点六元，比1955年增加了15.59％。灾情较为严重的新乡专区，平均有66.8％的社员增加了收入，其中非灾区有86.8％的社员增加了收入；轻灾区有73.6％的社员增加了收入，重灾区还有59.3％的社员增加了收入。从1956年农业生产合作社分配结果来看，每个劳动日一般平均合钱七角左右，有一部分社平均到一元五角左右，最多的平均到二元五角。非灾区除五保户外‘实际上每人吃粮一般在四百斤以上，有些吃到五百斤到七百斤。安阳专区十九个社的调查，1956年社员每人平均生活开支为五十七点五九元，比1955年增长20.1％。几种主要消费品提高的比例是：粮食11.6％，衣服74.4％，用棉5.5％，食盐8.3％，食油10.2％。有的社1956年每人平均生活标准一百零一元，比1955年提高四十七元。滑县“和平”一社户户增产，全社一百零七户，1956年除向社里投资二千多元外，还买了四千多尺各种颜色的洋布，二十五人穿上了新大衣，五十六人穿上了新绒衣，八十户购买了暖水瓶，三十多户盖上了新房子，此外还制了新被子四十条，两身皮袄，七辆自行车。社员们在地里高兴的唱着“共产党办法高，社会主义道路走的好”，“毛主席领导合作化，再不常年吃粉渣，吃喝穿戴全不怕，努力生产支援工业化”。有的反映：“土改翻了身，合作化扎富根”。
    农民的文化生活方面亦有很大的变化：全省民校学员由1955年的五百万人增加到八百四十三万人，1956年扫盲毕业生达一百三十五万人，相当于五年来扫盲毕业生总数的160％；有一百零三个县建立了有线广播；建立农村图书室六千二百一十五个，农村俱乐部一万八千九百八十九个，农村业余剧团一万二千六百八十三个；新建乡卫生院、所、室和接生站等一万零一百零三个，培养训练保健员、接生员十九万人；建立农村托儿所一万八千二百六十五个。全省中、小学的发展也是很快的，1956年高中学生由二万九千二百六十三人发展到四万三千八百九十八人，增加了50％；初中学生由二十一万一千一百零八人发展到二十六万八千一百一十四人，增加27％；小学生由四百四十二万八千三百零二人发展到四百八十九万零九百二十四人，增加10％；中学、师范学校由三百四十六所发展到五百零七所（不包括三百八十七所高小附设的初中班），增加了46.5％。这样满足了广大群众的迫切需要。正由于学校教育发展的快了，就出现了校舍不足、设备简陋等等的问题，但这是前进中的问题，是伴随着事业发展的好现象带来的。教育事业的大发展中，学生学习的情绪也是很高的，如有的带着馍上学，回到家中就积极参加生产。
    国家和工人阶级给河南农民的帮助是巨大的
    为了帮助农业社增加生产，使社员增加收入，国家和工人阶级给农民以巨大的支援。1956年国家在我省发放的各种农贷达二万四千六百九十二万元，发放救济款二千八百七十八万元，黄河修防和治淮共投资一万一千五百六十万元。一年来，光推广双铧犁九万八千二百部，步犁二万三千三百四十四部，马拉收割机一千四百五十六部，水车十七万部，喷雾、喷粉器五万一千零二十三架，其他新式农具二万四千二百八十四件。国家向农民要了多少钱呢？农业税（包括公粮、赋棉、代金及地方附加全部在内）共折款二万四千三百七十一万元（其中公粮占粮食总产量的9.34％），只相当于贷款、救济款总数的88.4％。
    此外，全省广大农村基层干部由于勤勤恳恳的工作，在做的中间吸取了教训，增长了才干，得到了锻炼，他们工作热情很高，与群众有血肉联系。一年来，由领导几户、几十户的互助组、初级社，一跃而为领导几百户、几千户的高级社，边干边学，克服了许多困难，使农业合作化和农业生产迅速取得了伟大胜利，这也是我们农村工作中一项很大的成绩。
    工作中的缺点
    当然我们在工作中是存在不少缺点的。办社工作中的缺点主要是：去年春季曾一度对副业生产注意不够；有些社在农业基建方面投资过大；在推广先进技术措施方面有些主观主义。这些已作了纠正。一部分社在管理制度和收益分配方面存在着一些问题，这些正在纠正。其次，是部分干部对高级合作化以后农村中新的变化和新的形势，对人们的思想意识落后于生产关系的改变，对农民的思想教育和集体劳动习惯的培养仍然是长期的艰苦的，都缺乏正确的分析认识，致放松了政治思想工作，忽视了阶级路线的贯彻；而对阶级敌人，部分干部和群众又产生了新的麻痹思想，放松专政。其三是部分农村基层干部中，有一些干部民主作风不够，有不同程度的强迫命令作风。当然发生这种缺点的原因是各方面的，有的缺点是主观主义官僚主义促成的；有的缺点是在办社初期，缺乏经验，任务繁重紧迫，各种制度都不健全的情况下难以避免的；有的缺点是由于干部思想水平的限制，需要在工作中不断教育提高才能纠正的。至于有些人所提站在群众头上作威作福的分子那只是个别的。
    由于存在着上述一些缺点和错误，因而也出现过个别地方闹社的问题。如临汝县就因为政治工作薄弱，处理收益分配问题做的不好和不及时，贯彻自愿互利政策和民主办社方针不够，加上坏分子破坏等原因，曾于去年秋季陆续发生过三十多个社闹事的事件。但经过进行工作，很快就解决了。
    在学校教育工作方面，正因为发展的快了一些，学校设备不足，加之许多工作跟不上，如学校政治领导薄弱，政治思想教育差，对学生生活关心不够等，这都是今后须要我们进一步研究解决和改进的。
    力争在三年左右使全省农民达到富裕中农收入的水平
    总之，我省高级农业合作化第一年的成绩是很大的，各方面都起了巨大的变化。但不是像有些人所提的好像只有缺点，没有优点。我个人认为应该热情的正视：成绩是主要的。当然工作中有缺点，但缺点是次要的，是新情况下不可能完全避免的现象。在1956年胜利的基础上，根据中共中央、毛主席和国务院“想尽一切办法、千方百计，争取今年大丰收”的指示，我们制定了争取今年农业大丰收的方针、任务和措施。要从各方面进一步巩固提高农业生产合作社，充分发挥社会主义农业集体经济的优越性，贯彻执行全国农业发展纲要（草案）的规定，全面发展以粮、棉为主的农业经济。并且如无特大灾情，要争取在三年左右的时间内，使全省所有农业生产合作社的社员，基本上达到或超过一般富裕农民的收入水平。为了完成上述光荣任务，要把政治工作放在第一位，从思想上进一步巩固集体所有制，继续大张旗鼓地开展以动员大生产为中心的宣传教育，调动一切积极力量，投入巩固合作社和争取农业丰收的大生产运动；认真贯彻执行勤俭办社、民主办社的方针，提高农业社的经营管理水平；积极兴修水利，加强麦田管理，大力发展养猪、积肥，保护、繁殖牲畜，推广新式农具和先进技术，发展多种经济等增产措施；密切联系群众，加强深入的调查研究，发动社员开展合理化建议，进一步教育和提高干部艰苦朴素、与群众同甘共苦的思想。
    在伟大的党中央、毛主席的英明领导和鼓舞下，我们满怀信心，在我省开展一个比去年更广泛更踏实的大生产运动，争取今年农业大丰收，并使农村的面目一年一年地向着共同富裕的方向前进。（附图片）
