Xinhua News Agency, London - The Singapore delegation, which is going to Britain to negotiate political status issues, arrived in London by plane today. Negotiations will begin on the 11th and are expected to last approximately two weeks.

Singapore's Chief Minister Lim Yew Hock submitted a white paper on the issue of negotiating Singapore's political status with Britain to the Legislative Assembly on the 4th. This white paper was passed by the Legislative Assembly on the 5th.

The white paper suggests that after the realization of internal self-government, Singapore's external defense and foreign affairs will still be controlled by Britain, but Singapore's trade and foreign cultural relations will be managed by the Singapore government; the resolutions passed by the proposed new Singapore Security Council on contentious events will be equally binding on both Britain and Singapore. The reason why the first round of negotiations between Britain and Singapore in April and May of last year reached a stalemate was that the British government insisted on having a decisive vote in this council in order to continue interfering in Singapore's internal affairs.

The white paper also suggests that after Singapore achieves self-government, a Governor-General, to be held by a Malay, should be appointed in addition to the British High Commissioner.

    同英国谈判自治问题
    新加坡代表团到达伦敦
    据新华社讯　前往英国谈判政治地位问题的新加坡代表团今日乘飞机到达伦敦。谈判将在11日开始，大约将进行两个星期。
    新加坡首席部长林有福曾在4日向立法会议提出关于同英国谈判新加坡政治地位问题的一项白皮书。这项白皮书已在5日立法议会上获得通过。
    白皮书中建议：在实现内部自治以后，新加坡的对外防务和外交事务将仍由英国掌握，但是新加坡的贸易和对外文化关系将由新加坡政府管理；拟议建立的新加坡安全委员会就引起争执的事件所通过的决议将对英国和新加坡双方具有同样的约束力。英国和新加坡之间在去年4、5月间举行的第一次谈判所以陷入僵局，就是因为英国政府坚持要在这个委员会中拥有决定性的一票，以便继续干涉新加坡的内部事务。
    白皮书还建议，在新加坡实现自治以后，在英国高级专员之外另设一名由马来人担任的总督。
