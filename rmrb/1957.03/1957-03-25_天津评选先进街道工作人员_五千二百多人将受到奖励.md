Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 23rd: Tianjin has selected over 5,200 advanced workers from street organizations in various districts. The People's Committees of each district are successively holding meetings to reward these advanced workers.

These advanced individuals have made significant achievements in conducting patriotic education for residents, publicizing government policies and decrees, and mobilizing residents to respond to government calls. Cai Jinfang, director of a residents' committee in Qian Dezhuang West Building, Hexi District, has been involved in street work since 1950. She frequently educates residents on the principles of building the country and managing households with diligence and thrift. Using detailed calculations, she explains the benefits of conserving electricity, water, and food for the country and individuals. Now, most of the more than 400 households have replaced their 40-watt and 50-watt light bulbs with 25-watt bulbs, and water consumption per household has also decreased. Recently, these households saved a total of over 900 jin of grain. Yang Suzhen, deputy director of a residents' committee in Haiguang Temple, Heping District, manages the lives of seven people with 40 yuan per month and saves five fen every day to buy public bonds. She has purchased 10 yuan worth of public bonds in three years, and now she still saves four yuan per month. Li Hong'e, director of a residents' committee in Xinhua Road, Tanggu District, enthusiastically helps solve problems for anyone in need, day or night. Once, a worker's family member, Chen Xuemin, suddenly fell ill. To prevent the worker from delaying production, Li Hong'e took Chen Xuemin to the hospital for treatment and watched over her in the hospital for a day and a night until Chen Xuemin's condition improved before returning home. She also actively publicized the government's policies and decrees to the masses, and was therefore twice named a model propagandist of the Party. Last August, she joined the Communist Party of China.

These advanced workers are deeply loved by the masses, and some have been elected as district people's representatives, members of the district people's committees, and members of the district political consultative conferences.

　　天津评选先进街道工作人员
　　五千二百多人将受到奖励
    新华社天津23日电　天津市各区已评选出五千二百多名街道组织中的先进工作人员。各区人民委员会正陆续召开会议，对这些先进工作人员进行奖励。
    这些先进人员，在向居民进行爱国主义教育、宣传政府政策法令、发动居民响应政府号召等方面，作出不少成绩。河西区谦德庄西楼一个居民委员会主任蔡金芳，1950年就参加了街道工作。她经常向居民宣传勤俭建国、勤俭治家的道理，并且用算细账的办法，说明节约电、水和粮食等对国家和个人的好处。现在四百多户居民大都将四十、五十瓦灯泡改换成二十五瓦的灯泡，每户的用水也有了减少，最近各户共节约了粮食九百多斤。和平区海光寺一个居民委员会副主任杨素珍，每月用四十元照料七口人的生活，并且每天节约五分钱积存起来购买公债，三年中认购了公债沽十元，现在每月还储蓄四元。塘沾区新华路一个居民委员会主任李鸿娥，只要听到谁家有困难，不论白天黑夜都热心地帮助解决。有一次工人家属陈学敏突然生病，李鸿娥为了不使工人耽误生产，就带着陈学敏到医院看病，在医院里看守了一天一夜，直到陈学敏的病情好转才回家。她还积极向群众宣传政府的政策法令，因此曾两次被评为党的模范宣传员。去年8月她加入了中国共产党。
    这些先进工作人员，深为群众爱戴，有些人被选为区人民代表、区人民委员会委员和区政协委员。
