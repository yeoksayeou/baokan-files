Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 19th: TASS reported from Moscow on March 19th: Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, answered questions raised by the editorial department of the American "Great Falls Tribune."

The first question raised by the reporter was: The Soviet Union announced that the United States is preparing for nuclear war. In this case, does this statement mean that, based on your assessment of the ideological contradictions between the Soviet Union and the United States, you believe that war is inevitable?

Khrushchev replied that, first of all, I would like to emphasize that the claim that the United States is preparing for nuclear war is the United States' own argument. Some American military and political figures openly express this argument. Everyone knows that the U.S. government stubbornly refuses to sign the Soviet Union's proposed agreement to ban atomic and hydrogen weapons.

We believe that war is not destined to be inevitable. The events in Egypt not long ago once again proved that the forces of peace can restrain the aggressors and prevent war.

Of course, maintaining and consolidating peace depends primarily on the policies of the major powers. As for us, the Soviet Union, we proceed from the historical fact that capitalist countries and socialist countries coexist on the earth. Despite their different social systems and ideologies, real life dictates that they must coexist peacefully. We advocate peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. The Soviet Union hopes to develop business and cultural ties with all countries, including the United States, for mutual benefit, because we believe that developing such ties helps to establish normal relations between countries and helps to strengthen trust between countries.

If the major Western powers, especially the United States, also abide by the principle of peaceful coexistence in their policies, then we are confident that peace will be maintained and consolidated.

The reporter then asked: In the past eleven years, has there ever been a period when the Soviet Union felt the danger of war was particularly great?

Khrushchev said that the danger of military conflict stems from the Western countries' policy of expanding armaments and "position of strength" policy, which has been implemented for many years. But everyone also knows that when the "position of strength" policy is put aside and negotiation methods are adopted, the sources of war can be eliminated. Korea and Indochina are examples. When the heads of government of the four major powers met in Geneva in the summer of 1955, the world saw a certain relaxation of international tensions. Unfortunately, this period did not last long. The invasion of Egypt, and the subsequent attempts by some countries to fill the so-called "vacuum" in the Arab East, which they fabricated out of thin air, have greatly deteriorated the international situation and seriously endangered peace in the region.

There is no doubt that here, there is only one way to solve the outstanding issues—negotiations between all parties concerned.

In answering the question of which aspects of the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States pose the greatest threat to peace, Khrushchev said that it is obvious that the "position of strength" policy pursued by the United States, in whatever form it manifests itself, poses a serious threat to the cause of peace, for example, refusing to disarm, expanding armaments, establishing military blocs and establishing bases on the territory of other countries, re-militarizing West Germany, attempting to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and trying to obstruct the development of international trade, economic and cultural relations between countries.

Of course, this policy is not in line with the task of easing international tensions and normalizing international relations.

We advocate easing international tensions and striving to improve relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, and believe that this approach is in the interests of the people of both the Soviet Union and the United States. It was with this desire that we proposed to the U.S. government in January 1956 that our two countries conclude a treaty of friendship and cooperation. Regrettably, this step by the Soviet Union, as well as a number of other proposals to improve relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, have not yet been approved by the U.S. government.

There is no doubt that as long as our two countries express their willingness to do their best to adjust relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, and make the necessary efforts to this end, then the improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States can be guaranteed, and this in turn will have a positive impact on the entire international situation.

    赫鲁晓夫答美国报纸问
    如果西方国家遵守共处原则和平将能巩固
    苏联主张缓和紧张局势争取改善苏美关系
    据新华社19日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科19日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫回答了美国“大瀑布城先驱报”编辑部提出的问题。
    记者提出的第一个问题是：苏联宣布说，美国准备进行核子战争。在这种情况下，这个声明是否意味着，根据您对苏联和美国之间意识形态的矛盾的估计，您认为战争是不可避免的？
    赫鲁晓夫答道，首先我愿意强调指出，关于美国准备进行核子战争的说法，是美国自己的论调。美国某些军政界人物公开发表这种论调。大家都知道，美国政府顽固地拒绝签订苏联提出的禁止原子武器和氢武器的协定。
    我们认为，战争不是注定不可避免的。不久以前埃及所发生的事件再次证明，维护和平的力量能够约束住侵略者，能够防止战争。
    当然，维护和巩固和平首先取决于大国的政策。至于我们苏联，我们是从这样一个历史事实出发的，那就是在地球上同时存在着资本主义国家和社会主义国家。尽管它们的社会制度和意识形态不同，现实生活却决定它们之间必须和平相处。我们主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处。苏联希望为了相互的利益同包括美国在内的所有国家发展事务联系和文化联系，因为我们认为，发展这种联系有助于建立各国的正常关系，有助于加强各国之间的信任。
    假如西方大国，首先是美国，在自己的政策中也遵守和平共处原则，那么，我们有信心说：和平将能够保持和巩固。
    记者又问：在过去十一年中，是否有过一个时期苏联感到战争的危险性特别大？
    赫鲁晓夫说，爆发军事冲突的危险是来源于西方国家多年来一直执行扩张军备政策和“实力地位”政策。但是大家也都知道，当“实力地位”政策被搁在一边而协商方法被采用的时候，战争策源地就能够消除，朝鲜和印度支那就是例子。1955年夏天四大国政府首脑在日内瓦举行会议的时候，举世看到国际紧张局势有了一定的缓和。可惜这个时期并不长久。埃及遭受侵略，以及某些国家紧接着企图填补它们凭空捏造出来的所谓阿拉伯东方的“真空”，又使得国际局势大大恶化起来，严重地危及这个地区的和平。
    毫无疑问，在这里，要解决悬而未决的问题也只有一条途径——一切有关方面举行谈判。
    在回答苏美两国之间的关系的哪些方面是对和平的最大威胁的问题的时候，赫鲁晓夫说，显而易见，美国执行的“实力地位”政策，无论是哪一方面的表现，都造成对和平事业的严重威胁，例如，拒绝裁军、扩充军备、建立军事集团和在别国领土上建立基地、使西德重新军国主义化、企图干涉其他国家的内政以及力图阻挠各国发展国际贸易、经济和文化关系。
    当然，这种政策是不符合缓和国际紧张局势和国际关系正常化的任务的。
    我们主张缓和国际紧张局势，争取改善苏美两国关系，认为这种做法是符合苏美两国人民的利益的。我们正是本着这种愿望在1956年1月向美国政府建议我们两国缔结友好合作条约。遗憾的是，苏联的这个步骤以及其他一些关于改善苏美两国关系的建议，直到现在还没有受到美国政府的赞同。
    毫无疑问，只要我们两国都表示愿意尽力调整苏联和美国之间的关系，并为此作必要的努力，那么苏美两国关系的改善就能够得到保证，而这反过来将会对整个国际局势产生良好的影响。
