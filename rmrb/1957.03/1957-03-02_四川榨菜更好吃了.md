    Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber is Even More Delicious
    According to Xinhua News Agency: The current season is for processing and producing Sichuan pickled mustard tuber. The thirty-plus processing plants in the Fuling Special District, the main production area for pickled mustard tuber, are improving the quality of the product based on consumer feedback. The first batch of over 30,000 jars of crisp, tender, and delicious pickled mustard tuber, which have been improved, will soon be shipped out.
    Last year, some consumers in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places reflected that the pickled mustard tuber was too salty, the color was not very bright red, and the aroma was not strong enough. This year, the pickled mustard tuber processing plants in Fuling Special District have increased the amount of green mustard tuber used per hundred jin of pickled mustard tuber from 275 jin to 320 jin, reducing the moisture content of the pickled mustard tuber. They have also appropriately reduced the amount of salt used, and used high-quality chili peppers produced in the West Sichuan Plain and various spices such as star anise, magnolia bark, licorice, and white pepper to mix them, making the color bright red and the aroma rich.

    四川榨菜更好吃了
    据新华社讯  目前正是四川榨菜加工生产的季节。榨菜主要产地涪陵专区的三十多个加工厂，正在根据消费者的意见，改进榨菜品质。经过改进的第一批三万多坛脆嫩鲜美的榨菜，不久即将外运。
    去年，广州、上海、武汉等地有些消费者反映：榨菜的咸味过重，颜色不甚鲜红，香味不浓。今年涪陵专区各榨菜加工厂，就把每百斤榨菜的青菜头用量从二百七十五斤增加到三百二十斤，减少了榨菜的水分；还适当减少用盐量，并采用川西平原出产的优质辣椒和八角、朴桂、甘草、白胡椒等多种香料拌制，使它颜色鲜红，香气浓郁。
