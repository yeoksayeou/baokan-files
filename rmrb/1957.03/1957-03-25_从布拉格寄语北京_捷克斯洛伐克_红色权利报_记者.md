Greetings to Beijing from Prague
Reporter from the Czechoslovak "Red Rights" Newspaper

When this article meets Chinese readers, our government delegation is paying a friendly visit to China. Accompanying our government delegation to China are countless visible and invisible companions, which is the heart of all the Czechoslovak people who care for and love the great Chinese people. We are happy and proud to call the Chinese people our friends and comrades. We are deeply convinced that the flower of cooperation between our two countries will bloom more and more, and the fruits of cooperation will become more and more abundant. We confidently wish the talks between the two governments a complete success. We believe that you and we have the same confidence in this.

Although our two countries are geographically far apart, we have a common goal—the goal of moving towards socialism. When Beijing is just crowing at dawn, Prague is just as the night falls, and thousands of lights are lit. The tireless sun shines on the vast land from Beijing to Prague. We and you are always working in alternating connections. How exciting this is! In order to live more happily tomorrow than today, millions of people are working with diligent hands and thinking hard on the shores of the Pacific Ocean and in the heart of Europe. The great song of free labor resounds through the clouds, and no force can stop this march of labor construction.

The Czechoslovak people have every reason to be proud that in the nearly twelve years since their country was liberated by the heroic Soviet army, they have built their motherland into a prosperous and happy country that has never existed in history and could not have been imagined before. From their own personal experience, they can fully appreciate the significance of the great achievements made by the Chinese people in building their own country with unparalleled energy. They understand that Czechoslovakia can provide effective assistance to China with its highly developed industry and experienced experts. And they did. They are happy to provide selfless assistance like true friends to friends, comrades to comrades.

Josef Brouzina, director of the boiler workshop of the Ostrava Gottwald Steel Plant, said when the Czechoslovak government delegation went to visit China: "Last year we completed the task of the People's Republic of China—manufacturing fourteen power plant boilers with a capacity of 75 tons. Most of these boilers have been put into production, adding power to Chinese industry. Until now, we have not heard of any returns or requests for compensation from China. We are very happy because this shows that Chinese comrades are satisfied with our work. Our factory was also awarded the prize flag of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry of the People's Republic of China because the workers worked hard and completed the production of these boilers ahead of schedule. This year we will produce two boilers with the same capacity as last year, and we are preparing to produce new orders—six large boilers with a capacity of 200 tons each. For our factory, Chinese orders are good work. Why is it good work? Because we always produce smaller boilers for other countries, and their types are different, so we cannot produce a series of the same products. The orders from the People's Republic of China gave us the possibility of producing a series of the same boilers, which is very beneficial to our workers and technicians. Whenever our people work for Chinese orders, they are always aware that they are helping the great Chinese people build a great and powerful country—a pillar of peace and socialism in the world. Therefore, working to complete Chinese orders is also working for peace and socialism, which is also helping ourselves, so they can work very enthusiastically. We can all feel that along with the boilers shipped to China are our greetings to Chinese comrades and our wishes for their greater success in building socialism."

Now, let us read the talk of Yang Fatna, a warehouse director in Pašlová Castle, a railway hub in Moravia. His thoughts are like a bouquet of small flowers of friendship, following our government delegation, dedicated to all of you—Chinese comrades. He said: "Although I am 68 years old and have never been to China, I often help pack cranes to be shipped to China. Whenever I have time, I take a bus to the Uničov Machine Factory to help load machines destined for China with my unique experience. The journey to your place is long, so it must be well packaged for transportation by train. The quality of our labor products will further enhance the trust of the Chinese working people in us. I know that the visit of our government delegation to China and other Asian countries is to further strengthen the unity between the people of all countries in order to play a greater role in international politics. China has a large population, a large land area, and abundant resources, and its needs are very large. Similarly, we also need to import a lot of goods from China. I hereby wish the visit of our government delegation the most complete success."

Many of our citizens have worked in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in recent years. They have had many pleasant opportunities, even daily contact with Chinese friends who came to Korea to help the Korean people in their most difficult times. Dr. Betshch Lobovsky, director of the Brno People's Health Institute, is one of our many citizens working in Korea. He recalled: "A year ago, I returned from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as a member of the Czechoslovak medical team. I feel very lucky to have personally met many sincere and simple Chinese friends in Korea. They, along with the Korean People's Army, bravely repelled the imperialist attack for the freedom and happiness of all peace-loving people in the world. They believe that it is only natural to fight bravely for the Korean people in the war and to help the Korean people heal the wounds of war in the selfless construction work after the armistice. I love all the humble, heroic, and sincere Chinese People's Volunteers as much as the Chinese people love them. They deserve to be called 'the most beloved people.' Whether in Korea or in China, the Chinese people I have met have left me with a good impression, and I feel happy whenever I think of them. I believe that I will always maintain the most sincere friendship with them. Therefore, I felt very happy and welcomed when I heard the news that the Czechoslovak government delegation was going to visit China. The delegation will definitely convey our friendship and sympathy to the fraternal Chinese people, and convey our sincere hope—hope that they will achieve greater success in building a great socialist China."

The farmers in Czechoslovakia are also watching with great interest the process of such rapid cooperativization in the Chinese countryside. The agricultural cooperativization in China and the change in the lives of such a large number of farmers are a great encouragement to the members of our agricultural cooperatives. Antoni Fanniada, the director of a unified agricultural cooperative in Yodna Township, wrote to us saying: "Czechoslovak and Chinese farmers are taking the same path—from the scattered small production of individual farmers to the socialist collective large-scale production. We have noticed how fast the Chinese farmers are advancing. This is a great support for us. Our unified agricultural cooperative is one of the first cooperatives established in the whole county. I want to say to the Chinese farmers, my comrades: we are on the right track. Our cooperative had very few members when it was first established, but we gradually gained the majority. And today, even the farmers who have just joined the cooperative do not want to go back to the past of individual management. We have experienced many difficulties and unpleasant things. Some members have raised more livestock (sheep, goats, etc.) on their private plots than the charter allows. We Communists are irreconcilable with shortcomings, so we stood up against this bad phenomenon. Finally, the livestock that exceeded the charter was properly handled. Originally, we thought that doing so would definitely cause individual farmers to withdraw from the cooperative. As a result, no one asked to withdraw from the cooperative. Even we ourselves failed to estimate enough that in such a short period of time, the members have deeply realized the superiority of socialist collective management."

There is no doubt that the Czechoslovak people are paying close attention to the achievements of Chinese scientists, and the scientific ties between the People's Republic of China and the Czechoslovak Republic will definitely be strengthened day by day. This wish was expressed in a conversation by Associate Professor Miroslav Penga, director of the Department of Pharmacy at Brno University. He said: "Brno University warmly supports the visit of our government delegation to the People's Republic of China. We are deeply convinced that this visit will help to expand and strengthen the existing friendly exchanges in culture and economy between our two countries. Scientists at Brno University especially look forward to expanding the exchange of cultural materials and scientific achievements between the two countries. Until now, there has been very little Chinese scientific data in our country. We can only learn about the outstanding achievements of the Chinese people from our publications or from Soviet materials. We are very willing to learn more about the scientific work of Chinese scientists, who are solving many important problems in industry, agriculture, education, and health that are common to our two countries. The emergence of our urgent desire for Chinese scientific data and works is also because there are young men and women from the People's Republic of China studying in our department, and their hard work, perseverance, and diligence have won our unanimous praise and have become a force to encourage and help our students work hard."

This is how the Czechoslovak people view the visit of our government delegation to China, and this is how they understand the friendship with the Chinese people. For the Czechoslovak people, this visit is their joy and encouragement. Let the visit of our government delegation further strengthen the friendship between our two countries and give this friendship more substantial content! This is the most ardent wish sent to you along with our friendly greetings, dear Chinese friends.

　　从布拉格寄语北京
　　捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”记者
    当这篇文章和中国读者见面的时候，我国政府代表团正在中国进行着友好访问。这次随同我国政府代表团到中国去的还有数不清和看不见的许多同伴，那就是关怀和热爱着伟大中国人民的捷克斯洛伐克全体人民的心。我们能把中国人民称作自己的朋友和同志，我们感到高兴和自豪。我们都深信我们两国间的合作之花将愈开愈盛，合作之果愈结愈多。我们满怀信心地预祝两国政府的会谈定会获得圆满的成功。我们相信你们和我们对此有着同样的信心。
    我们两国虽然在地理上相距很远，但是我们有着共同的目标——走向社会主义的目标。当北京刚刚鸡鸣报晓，布拉格正是夜幕降临，万家灯火的时候了。不知疲倦的太阳照射着从北京到布拉格这块广阔的土地。我们和你们总是在交替连接工作着。这是多么令人兴奋啊！为了使明天比今天生活得更幸福，在太平洋畔和在欧洲的心脏千百万人挥动着勤劳的双手工作着，紧张地思考着。伟大的自由的劳动歌声响彻云霄，任何力量也不能阻挡这劳动建设的进军。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民有充分的理由为此而感到自豪，他们在英勇的苏联军队解放后的近十二年时间内，已经把自己的祖国建设成为历史上从来没有过的，以前也不能想像的繁荣、幸福的国家。他们从自己切身的经验中完全能体会到中国人民以其无比的精力建设自己国家所获得的伟大成就的意义。他们明白，捷克斯洛伐克是能够以其高度发展的工业和有经验的专家对中国提供有效的帮助的。他们也确是这样做了。他们乐于像真正的朋友对朋友，同志对同志那样地提供着无私的援助。
    俄斯特拉发哥特瓦尔德钢铁厂锅炉车间主任约瑟夫·勃娄齐纳在捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团去中国访问的时候发表谈话说：“去年我们完成了中华人民共和国定货的任务——制造了十四个容量七十五吨的发电厂锅炉，这些锅炉已大部分投入生产，为中国工业增添了动力。直到目前为止我们还没有从中国听说有什么退货或要求赔偿的事。我们非常高兴，因为这表明中国同志们对我们的工作是满意的。我们厂还因为工人们努力工作，提前完成了这些锅炉的生产而获得了中华人民共和国电力工业部的奖旗。今年我们还要生产两个和去年生产的容量相同的锅炉，并且我们正在准备生产新的订货——六个容量各二百吨的大锅炉。对我们厂来讲，中国订货是很好的活儿。为什么是好活儿？因为我们为其他国家生产的总是较小的锅炉，而且它们的种类不同，不能进行一系列同种产品的生产。中华人民共和国的订货给了我们生产一系列同样的锅炉的可能性，这对我们工人和技术人员是极有利的。我国人民无论何时在为中国订货而工作时，总是自觉到他们是在帮助伟大的中国人民建设一个伟大的强国——世界上和平和社会主义的一个支柱。所以为完成中国订货而工作也就是为和平和社会主义而工作，也就是对自己的帮助，因此他们能很热情地工作。我们都感觉得出，和锅炉一同运往中国的还有我们的向中国同志问候的情意和祝贺他们在建设社会主义事业中获得更大成功的心愿。”
    现在，让我们再读一读在摩拉维亚地区的铁路枢纽派什洛伐城的一位仓库主任杨·伐特纳的谈话吧。他的思想好比一束友谊的小花束，跟随在我国政府代表团之后，献给你们全体——中国同志们。他说：“我虽已六十八岁了，也并未到过中国，但我却常帮助包装运往中国的起重机，我一有空就乘车到乌聂契夫机器制造厂去，以我特有的经验帮助装运送往中国的机器。到你们那儿去路途遥远，所以用火车运输必需要包装得好好的。我们劳动产品的质量会更加增强中国劳动人民对我们的信任。我知道，我国政府代表团到中国和其他亚洲国家去访问是为了更加增强各国人民间的团结，以便在国际政治上发挥更大的作用。中国人口多，土地大，物产丰富，它的需要量很大。同样地我们也需从中国输入很多货物。我在此预祝我国政府代表团的访问获得最圆满的成功。”
    我们很多的公民在最近几年里曾在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国工作。他们有很多愉快的机会，甚至每天和在朝鲜人民最困难的时刻里来到朝鲜帮助朝鲜人民的中国朋友们接触。布尔诺人民保健所所长贝特士赫·洛勃夫斯基博士就是我们的在朝鲜工作的许多公民中的一个。他这样回忆：“一年前我以捷克斯洛伐克医疗组组员的身份从朝鲜民主主义人民共和国回来。我感到很幸运，在朝鲜时能亲自和很多诚恳朴实的中国朋友认识。他们和朝鲜人民军一道为着全世界一切爱好和平的人民的自由和幸福，英勇地打退了帝国主义的进攻。他们认为在战争中为朝鲜人民英勇战斗以及在停战后帮助朝鲜人民治愈战争创伤所作的忘我的建设工作都是理所当然的。我爱所有谦虚、英勇、真诚的中国人民志愿军就跟中国人民爱他们那样，他们值得称为‘最可爱的人’。不论在朝鲜还是在中国，我所遇见的中国人都留给我良好的印象，每当我想起他们，我就感到愉快。我相信我永远会保持着对他们的最真挚的友谊。所以我听到了捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团到中国访问的消息，感到非常的高兴和欢迎。代表团定会向亲如兄弟的中国人民传达我们的友谊和同情，传达我们的诚挚的希望——希望他们在建设伟大的社会主义中国的事业中获得更大的成就。”
    在捷克斯洛伐克的农民们也以极大的兴趣注视着中国农村如此迅速地合作化的过程。中国农业合作化，数量这样众多的农民的生活的改变对于我国的农业合作社社员是极大的鼓励。耀得纳乡的一个统一农业合作社的社长安东尼·范聂达写信给我们说：“捷克斯洛伐克和中国农民走的是相同的道路——从个体农民分散的小生产走向社会主义的集体大生产。我们注意到中国农民是以怎样快速的脚步在前进。这对我们是很大的支援。我们的统一农业合作社是全县第一批建立的合作社中的一个。我想对中国农民们，我的同志们说：我们的路是走对了。我们社在初建的时候人数很少，但是我们渐渐地获得了多数。而今天即使是刚入社不久的农民们也都不想再回到过去单干的经营方式去了。我们经历了很多困难和令人不愉快的事。有些社员曾在自留地上饲养了比社章许可多得多的家畜（绵羊、山羊等）。我们共产党人是和缺点不可调和的，我们就起来反对这种不良现象。最后，合理地处理了多于社章规定的家畜。原来我们以为这样做了定会引起个别农家退社的。结果一家都未提出退社的要求。连我们自己都未能足够估计到，在这样短的时期里社员们已深深地体会到了社会主义集体经营的优越性了。”
    捷克斯洛伐克人民极关切地注意着中国科学工作者的成果，这是毫无疑问的，中华人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国之间的科学上的联系一定会日益加强。这个愿望由布尔诺大学药物系主任米洛斯拉夫·朋加副教授的一次谈话里表示了出来。他说：“布尔诺大学热忱地拥护我国政府代表团到中华人民共和国去访问。我们深信这次访问定将有助于扩大和加强目前已有的在我们两国间的文化和经济方面的友好的交流。布尔诺大学的科学工作者特别盼望能扩大两国文化资料和科学成果的交换。直到目前为止，在我国只有很少的中国的科学资料。我们只能从我国出版的出版物或从苏联资料里获悉中国人民的杰出的成绩。我们很愿意多多了解中国科学工作者的科学工作，他们正在解决着许多重大的，对我们两国都是共同的工业、农业、教育、卫生方面的问题。我们渴望中国科学资料和著作的迫切心愿的产生，还因为在我们系里有来自中华人民共和国的男女青年们在进修，而他们的刻苦求学、坚毅勤奋精神获得我们一致的赞扬，并且成了鼓励和帮助我国学生们努力工作的力量。”
    捷克斯洛伐克人民就是这样看待我国政府代表团在中国的访问的，就是这样了解和中国人民的友谊的。对于捷克斯洛伐克人民来说，这次访问是他们的快乐和鼓励。让我国政府代表团的访问愈益加强我们两国间的友谊，并给予这个友谊更加充实的内容吧！这就是同我们友爱的问候一起寄送给你们的最热烈的愿望，亲爱的中国朋友们。
