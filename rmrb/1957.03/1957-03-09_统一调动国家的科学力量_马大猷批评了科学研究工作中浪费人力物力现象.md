I fully endorse Premier Zhou's report on his visit to eleven Asian and European countries presented at the conference, and I agree with the reports of other responsible comrades. I am particularly excited to have participated in the enlarged meeting of the Supreme State Conference, where I heard Chairman Mao's incisive analysis and brilliant instructions on the internal relations of the people in socialist countries and the relations between ourselves and the enemy. I feel extremely fortunate to live in the Mao Zedong era and feel filled with strength.

Now, allow me to offer some personal opinions on the development of science.

Since the Party issued the call for "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," the academic community across the country has experienced unprecedented vitality. Scientific workers have increased their confidence in their work a hundredfold. The Party's concern for scientific endeavors has made scientific workers feel exceptionally close and warm, greatly increasing their enthusiasm for socialist construction. In the first half of 1956, many scientific workers participated in the formulation of the National Twelve-Year Science Development Plan, gaining a more vivid and concrete understanding of the Party's determination to develop science. This blueprint for the development of scientific work gives us full confidence that we will not lose our way in our work. The science plan has now been in effect for a year. In this year, the composition of the scientific workforce has changed significantly. Many new research units have been established, and many old institutions have been strengthened. The Academy of Sciences, universities, and research units in production departments have all formulated their research plans for the year and have coordinated them. This allows us to climb the peaks of science in a coordinated manner, approaching and catching up with world standards in a relatively short period, enabling the diligence and wisdom of the Chinese people to play a due role in the development of world science. Scientific workers are all encouraged and inspired by the good start to our country's scientific development. How willing we are to contribute all our knowledge and strength to our country's scientific endeavors!

Based on the experiences encountered in the past year, I believe that we are not without problems in the development of science. I will now describe some of the situations I have observed:

      Appropriate Division of Labor, Close Cooperation

It is very clear that, in order to develop science and promote the development of industry and agriculture, the Academy of Sciences, universities, and research units in production departments must have a good division of labor and close cooperation in scientific research. Scientific problems are complex and intricate. Some work is suitable for research by the Academy of Sciences, some for research by production departments, and many for research by universities. Good organic coordination between these aspects can greatly promote the development of science. Any attempt by one side to monopolize everything is not only absurd but also harmful to the development of science. In the past, some people suggested that scientific research should mainly be conducted in the Academy of Sciences. Now, some people are saying that in the Soviet Union, scientific research should be centered on universities. Some industrial departments also plan to establish a large number of research units to cover everything from basic problems to product design. This has caused great confusion in the scientific community. Which method should we follow, or should we determine other methods suitable for our national conditions? It is necessary for the government to make a decision, otherwise, not only will it cause confusion and waste in our work, but it will also cause disputes between departments, affecting the development of national science.

    No Need to Sing a Rival Tune

Currently, there are some problems in the establishment of research institutions. For example, according to the emergency measures of the science plan, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has established the Institute of Electronics, which has a research section for electron tubes, focusing on microwave electron tubes and conducting basic research on ordinary electron tubes. The Second Ministry of Machine Building has also established an electron tube research institute in Beijing with almost the same tasks. In both institutes, there are very few senior researchers, and they also have to be responsible for preparatory work. Therefore, the burden is very heavy, and the progress of the work is slow. When senior researchers are very scarce and at a time when the state is calling for streamlining and economizing, is it necessary to sing such a rival tune? I believe that this waste of our valuable manpower and resources should be adjusted. There may be similar situations, and I hope the government will pay attention and correct them.

    Give Full Play to the Expertise of Senior Scientific Cadres

We know that in scientific research, leadership is very important. How to cherish and make full use of our few senior scientific cadres is one of the key issues for the development of science in our country. Unfortunately, even now, many accomplished senior scientists have not been able to fully utilize their expertise. For example, our country has a long coastline, and underwater acoustics research, which is of decisive significance to coastal defense, is basically still a blank in our country. Therefore, carrying out underwater acoustics research is one of the important issues in the development of science in our country. Last year, when the science plan was being formulated, our country specially invited a corresponding academician of underwater acoustics from the Soviet Union to help us plan. This shows the government's emphasis. In our country, there is only one scientist who has conducted systematic research on underwater acoustics in the past. The natural idea is to ask this comrade to preside over this important research work. The problem is that this proposal has been made, and the scientist himself has repeatedly stated that he should do this work, but until now, he has not obtained the consent of the relevant units (the Ministry of Higher Education). Of course, each side has its reasons, but from the perspective of the entire national science, I cannot but say that this is unreasonable. In addition to this comrade, there are still many senior scientists who long for the state to arrange them in suitable jobs so that they can fully contribute their expertise to the country. Comrades, many of the older scientists in our country have had very unfortunate experiences. The years when their creativity was at its peak were spent during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. At that time, scientific work did not receive attention and support, and there were not even basic working conditions and environment. Therefore, some people were unwilling to waste their best years in vain and "sailed away on rafts," and there are still many people who have not been able to return to their beloved motherland for various reasons. Scientists who persisted in working in the country have done some work in education and production, but they have not been able to exert their strength in scientific research, and have even gradually become rusty. What a great loss this is for individuals and for the country! Now, in the midst of the nationwide march towards science, older scientists are particularly excited and demand to play the role of "old hands." This feeling is completely understandable and worthy of sympathy. Chairman Mao said that we should not pour cold water on the demands of scientists. These words have been particularly profound and touching to me because there is a lot of painful history behind these scientists' demands. I feel that it is necessary for the government to pay special attention to the proper arrangement of scientists, to criticize and stop the departmentalism of various units, so as to fully发挥(give full play to) the existing scientific strength of our country. This is of great significance to the country's scientific undertakings.

The problems mentioned above are often not resolved through consultations between several departments. Therefore, I personally feel that it is necessary for the government to strengthen the leadership of scientific work, solve these problems, and solve other problems that cannot be solved between various departments, to unify and deploy the nation's scientific strength to make the most appropriate arrangements, and to do a good job in the country's top scientific decision-making. I believe that this will greatly promote the development of scientific undertakings in our country and reduce the waste of manpower and material resources in scientific work. Please criticize and correct any errors in my views. (Attached picture)

### 统一调动国家的科学力量  马大猷批评了科学研究工作中浪费人力物力现象

    统一调动国家的科学力量
    马大猷批评了科学研究工作中浪费人力物力现象
    我完全拥护周总理在大会上所作的关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告，并且同意其他几位负责同志的报告。我特别感到兴奋的是参加了最高国务会议的扩大会议，听到毛主席关于社会主义国家人民内部关系和敌我关系的精辟分析和英明指示，我觉得生活在毛泽东时代是万分幸福的，觉得全身充满了力量。
    现在请让我对于发展科学的问题提出一些个人的意见。
    自从党发出了百花齐放百家争鸣的号召以来，全国学术界已经出现了空前的活跃气象，科学工作者对自己的工作都增加了百倍信心。党关怀科学事业使科学工作者感到异常亲切和温暖，大大地增加了对社会主义建设事业的积极性。1956年上半年，很多科学工作者参加了国家十二年科学发展规划的制定工作，更生动而具体地认识了党对发展科学事业的决心。这个发展科学工作的蓝图使我们有充分信心，在工作中不致迷失方向。现在科学规划已过了一年。在这一年中，科学工作的阵容已经改观了，许多新的研究单位建立起来了，许多老的机构也有所加强。科学院、高等学校、生产部门的研究单位都已制定了本年度的研究计划，并且进行了协调。这样就使我们有可能步调整齐地攀登科学的高峰，在比较短的时间内接近和赶上世界水平，使中国人民的勤劳和智慧在世界科学的发展中起到应有的作用。科学工作者都为我国科学发展的良好开端而欢欣鼓舞，我们多么愿意为我国的科学事业贡献出自己的一切知识和力量啊！
    根据过去一年的工作中所遇到的情况，我认为我们在发展科学的工作中也不是毫无问题的，现在把看到的一些情况叙述如下：
      恰当分工，密切合作
    非常明显，为了发展科学事业促进工农业的发展，科学院、高等学校和生产部门的研究单位必须在科学研究工作中很好地分工，密切地合作。科学问题是错综复杂的，有些工作适于科学院研究，另一些适于生产部门研究，也有很多适于高等学校研究。几个方面作好有机配合就可以大大促进科学的发展，任何一方面想要包办一切，就不仅是荒唐的，对科学的发展也是有害的。过去就有人提出过科学研究工作主要在科学院进行。现在又有人讲，在苏联，科学研究工作要以高等学校为中心了。也有些产业部门打算建立大量研究单位从基本问题直到产品设计都包下来。这样就给科学界造成很大混乱。到底按照那个办法，还是定出适合我国情况的其他办法，有必要请政府作出决定，否则不但在工作中造成混乱和浪费，各部门间也要引起争执，影响到国家科学的发展。
    不必要这样唱对台戏
    目前在研究机构的设置方面就存在一些问题。例如，中国科学院根据科学规划紧急措施，设立了电子学研究所，在这个所里有电子管的研究部分，以微波电子管为重点并作普通电子管的基本研究工作。第二机械工业部也在北京设立了一个电子管的研究所，任务几乎完全相同。两个所里，高级研究人员都很少而且还要负责筹备工作。因此负担都很重，而工作的进展很慢。在高级研究人员很缺乏的时候，在国家精简节约声中，有没有必要这样唱对台戏？我认为这种浪费我们的宝贵的人力和物力的作法，应该加以调整。类似这种情况的可能还有，希望政府注意并加以纠正。
    发挥高级科学干部的专长
    我们知道，在科学研究工作中，领导力量是非常重要的，如何珍惜和充分利用我们所有的为数不多的高级科学干部，对我国科学发展工作是关键性问题之一。遗憾的是，直到现在还有不少有成就的高级科学人员没有能充分发挥他们的专长。举个例来说，我国的海岸线很长，而对海防有决定性意义的水声学研究工作在我国基本还是空白的。因此开展水声学研究就是我国发展科学中的重要问题之一，去年科学规划时，我国特别邀请一位苏联水声学的通讯院士来帮助我们规划，这可见政府的重视了。在我国，过去曾对水声学进行过系统研究工作的科学家只有一位。人们很自然的想法是请这位同志来主持这个重要的研究工作。问题是这样提出的，科学家本人也再三说明应该让他作这个工作，可是一直到现在还没有获得有关单位（高等教育部）的同意。当然每一方面都有他的道理，可是就整个国家的科学事业来说，我不能不说这是不合理的。除了这位同志以外，渴望国家给他安排到适宜的工作岗位，以便把自己的专长充分贡献给国家的高级科学人员也还是不乏其人的。各位委员，我国的很多年纪稍大的科学家的遭遇都是很不幸的。他们的创造力最旺盛的年代都是在国民党反动统治时期度过的。在那时，科学工作受不到重视和支持，甚至于连起码的工作条件和环境都没有。因此就有一些人不甘心把自己的大好时光白白度过而“乘桴浮于海”了，至今还有不少人因为种种原因未能回到亲爱的祖国。在国内坚持工作的科学家虽然在教育工作和生产工作中尽到了一些力量，但是对科学研究工作都使不出劲来，甚至渐渐荒疏了。这对于个人，对于国家是多么大的损失啊！现在，在全国向科学进军的声中，年纪大一些的科学家特别感到兴奋，要求起一个“识途老马”的作用。这个心情是完全可以体会的，也是值得同情的。毛主席说，对科学家的要求不可以泼冷水，这话让我觉得特别深刻，受到很大的感动，因为这些科学家的要求背后是有不少辛酸的历史的，我觉得政府有必要特别重视科学家的妥善安排，批判并制止各单位的本位主义，以充分发挥我国现有的科学力量。这样对国家的科学事业有非常巨大意义的。
    像上面所提出的一些问题，往往不是几个部门之间协商可以解决的，因此我个人觉得有必要请政府加强科学工作的领导，解决这些问题，也解决其他各部门间不能解决的问题，统一调动国家的科学力量作最适当的安排，作好国家最高科学决策工作。我相信这样作可以大大地促进我国科学事业的发展，减少科学工作中对人力物力浪费的现象。我的看法有错误的地方，请予以批评和指正。（附图片）
