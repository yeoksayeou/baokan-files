    The Drama of Sichuan Opera's "Beautiful Bridal Chamber"
    Dai Bufan
    I have seen five full-length operas and four short skits performed by the Chengdu Sichuan Opera Troupe in Beijing. Among these, "Beautiful Bridal Chamber," while not the best, left a deep impression on me.
    "Beautiful Bridal Chamber" is originally a scene from Li Yu's "Kite Misunderstanding" (originally titled "Surprised by Beauty"). After seeing it, I truly admire the ancient playwrights; they truly understood the essence of drama!—Look, the bride Zhan Shujuan hides her face with a fan, and the whole "play" "comes out." How charming and clever!
    Some say that this scene is nothing more than a misunderstanding! Indeed, at first glance, it is a misunderstanding; but it is a "misunderstanding" built on a foundation of truth. The truth lies, on one hand, in the fact that it is reasonable for ancient brides to be shy; on the other hand, it lies even more in the fact that the groom, Han Zhongqi, would certainly disdain to glance at the bride. —Therefore, he would inevitably regard the beautiful woman so close to him as an ugly woman and be angry with her.
    From Han Zhongqi's words, the audience will gradually understand that there is much more to why he locks himself in to sleep alone: his kite was once picked up by Miss Zhan, who even wrote a poem on it and invited him to meet her; Zhan's ugliness and her attempted indecency towards him are things Han Zhongqi cannot tolerate. And now, forced by his adoptive father, he is marrying the woman he despises the most! Asking him to carefully examine his bride at this time would be harder than a camel passing through the eye of a needle. In the eyes of the audience who understand the situation (the ugly woman Zhongqi once met was actually Shujuan's sister), Han Zhongqi is misunderstanding at this moment; but for Han Zhongqi, he sincerely believes that the bride is the indecent, ugly woman he met last year. At this moment, when he is in the bridal chamber with her, he is too busy being angry to have the mood to carefully look at her "honorable face"!—One is shy, the other is unwilling; in the same room for their wedding night, there is a clear dividing line. Obviously, this divide is not artificially drawn by the author, but a "natural barrier" that follows the development of the characters' emotions.
    However, if Li Yu only understood and was familiar with the feelings of this couple, I think he would not be considered a master. The wonder lies in his skill in using the fan, which is commonly used on the opera stage. If Zhan Shujuan didn't cover her face, she wouldn't look like a respectable lady as a bride; and Han Zhongqi wouldn't be able to avoid seeing her.—Then, the "misunderstanding" would be gone, and the "play" would be over. However, according to the customs of life and the stage, after entering the bridal chamber, the bride can either cover her face with a red veil or sit with her back turned.—Imagine, if the author had handled it this way, it would be like teaching people to "not see the true face of Mount Lu," and what would the dramatic effect be? The author's ingenuity lies in his arrangement for Zhan Shujuan to cover her face with a fan. This not only depicts her shyness but also just blocks Han Zhongqi's sight. However, the author's arrangement does not block the audience's sight. The author not only takes care of the stage but also clearly explains to the audience: Zhan Shujuan is a proper, well-behaved, and beautiful "qingyi" (leading female role) character. The author then freely writes about how Han Zhongqi imagines this "qingyi" to be an "ugly dan" (comedic female role). Therefore, the more Han Zhongqi hates, loathes, and mocks the other party, the more the audience finds him ridiculous. Here, the entire key of the "play" lies in a magical fan.
    I think, if I were a novelist, and I were to write the same story, I would definitely use a lot of flashbacks and supplementary descriptions to describe Zhan Shujuan's character and appearance, and even add the author's comments to explain Han Zhongqi's illusion; however, in this play, which lasts only about forty-five minutes, the author is not allowed to do so. Of course, if I were a mediocre playwright, while covering the bride's face with a red veil, I could also have the maid sing a passage to introduce her lady's character; however, whether the maid's introduction is true or false cannot be confirmed until the end of the play, and Han Zhongqi's series of actions and words can only be judged to be ridiculous until the end of the play. Thus, this can only become a straightforward narrative, not a "play" full of laughter. At the same time, having the maid sing a passage not only affects the progress of the story but also affects the prominence of the protagonist, which is so uneconomical! The clever Li Yu made a fuss about the fan, letting the audience see that the person sitting on the side is a "qingyi," but letting the groom be angry and hate her as an "ugly dan," which achieves both the meticulousness of the description and the conciseness of the structure. His talent is truly worth learning from.
    In terms of dramatic style, Li Yu is relatively delicate. However, within the delicacy, there is still a kind of enormous power. This power is: when he conceives the story, he can boldly arrange Han Zhongqi to be depicted in a situation that is completely contrary to his subjective imagination—thinking she is an ugly woman but actually she is a beauty; thinking it is misfortune but actually it is a happy event; .... This ability to grasp the contradiction between the character's subjective life domain (illusion, imagination, desires, etc.) and the objective life domain (situation) is not unique to Li Yu but is common to all classical writers. In the Sichuan opera "Spring Lantern Riddles," the drunken scholar finds himself sleeping in the most embarrassing place—the official's daughter's bed; Tan Ji'er knowingly enters the tiger's mouth—going to Wangjiang Pavilion to see Yang Yanei, whom she is determined not to marry, but who is determined to have her, also illustrates this issue. If Han Zhongqi had seen Zhan Shujuan's true face as soon as he entered the bridal chamber, there would be no play called "Beautiful Bridal Chamber"; if the person on Wangjiang Pavilion was not Yang Yanei, who wanted to seize Tan Ji'er, but just an ordinary imperial envoy who was also carrying the sword of power and the golden plaque to take away Bai Shizhong's official seal, then there would be a lack of thrilling scenes here. However, as mentioned above, if you only know this contradiction but are not good at showing the audience very specifically that Zhan Shujuan is a "qingyi" and how Yang Yanei wants to get Tan Ji'er, then you still cannot create a drama.
    "Ah! Look at the ugly woman sitting on the side, covering her face with a fan, pretending to be shy! Ugly woman, ugly woman! Have you finally realized your conscience? How can your little fan cover up so much ugliness!"
    This is a monologue by Han Zhongqi after entering the bridal chamber. If the person sitting next to him was really an ugly woman, then this would become a straightforward narrative, and what would be worth talking about? However, here it becomes a joke; after watching the whole scene, thinking about it again, it is endlessly thought-provoking, and the reason can be summed up in one sentence: the speaker's subjective thoughts contradict the objective reality. In "Radish Garden," "This young one will never dare to do it again!" is a plea for forgiveness; however, here, the speaker intends to say that he will never dare to "leave without permission" to watch the lanterns again; the listener—his father-in-law—thinks that this is confirmation that his—fiancé and daughter are having an affair. Turning the rotten into the magical, an ordinary language becomes a source of laughter, and the principle is the same as the above situation. In "Mu Guiying," Guiying's long aria boasting about how she broke the Tianmen Formation in the past might be very beautiful poems if placed elsewhere but cannot become a "play"; the reason why it becomes a wonderful scene here is not only because of the majestic momentum of the aria itself and the actor sings it deliciously, and dances so dazzlingly, but also because the more she sings, the more unconsciously she walks into the plan of Kou Zhun, who is instigating her from the side, and the more it contradicts the original intention of She Taijun. This is "play," this is the language in "play." In short, good language in a play must have an "implied meaning"; its thought-provoking point is always inseparable from the drama of the whole play.
    A play like "Beautiful Bridal Chamber" of course belongs to the "romance" category. Although it is a bit "coincidental," it does not make people feel that it is contrived. From the moment the groom, with a face full of anger and abnormal steps, comes on stage, the audience is wondering: why is he so unwilling to marry Zhan Shujuan? (Also, why is this seemingly antagonistic marriage named "Beautiful Bridal Chamber"?) ... The bride sees that the groom has gone to sleep alone, so she timidly returns to her mother Liu's room; Liu then comes to question the groom, so she returns to the room to question her daughter about making a shameful thing; after learning the details, she asks the groom, and finally calls her daughter to "look at each other," and the truth comes out.... Here, the plot is winding and tortuous, and the waves are horizontal and vertical. After watching the previous scene, one cannot help but watch the second scene; and it will never make the audience "draw lots"—leave halfway. At the same time, it is from these tortuous plots on the scene that the author also writes a tortuous past in a virtual way: flying kites, writing poems, dating, being shocked by ugliness, being forced to marry .... I think, the author is indeed writing characters here; but if he only focuses on the characters and only seeks to express the contradiction between Han Zhongqi's illusion and reality, then he can completely handle it in another way: let the angry groom knock down the fan in the bride's hand; let the maid come out and reveal everything, etc. In this way, he can also similarly write Han Zhongqi's sudden "surprise at beauty" comedy. However, Li Yu does not go against the rationality of the play here but sells a "mystery." He uses the method of peeling cocoons and drawing silk, step by step, completely and originally, tortuously revealing the "mystery" and completing the character description. In this way, the play becomes more interesting. Intriguing plot stories are indispensable here.

    川戏“美洞房”的戏剧性
    戴不凡
    成都市川剧团来京公演，我已经看过他们五本大戏和四折小戏。在这些戏中，“美洞房”虽不是最好的一个戏，可是，它也给我留下一个深刻的印象。
   “美洞房”原是李笠翁“风筝误”中之一折（原名“诧美”）。看了它，我真钦佩古代的剧作家，他们真是懂得戏中三昧！——你看，新娘子詹淑娟把扇子一遮脸，整个“戏”就“出来”了。多么俏皮、聪明啊！
    有人说，这折戏不过是一场误会而已！的确，乍看起来，这是误会；但这是建筑在真实基础上的“误会”。真实，一方面在于古代的新娘怕羞是情理中的事；另方面更在于新郎韩仲琦必然不屑去瞧新娘一眼。——因而，他必然把近在咫尺的美妇当作为丑妇，并和她呕气。
    从韩仲琦的言语中，观众会逐渐清楚，他所以一人关门去睡，内中是有很多文章的：他的风筝曾经被詹家小姐拾去，而且题上诗，还约他去相会过；詹小姐的奇丑和对他企图非礼，这是韩仲琦万万不能容忍的。而现在，他被养父所逼，竟和他最不齿的女人结婚！要叫他此时去仔细端详一下他的新娘，那一定比骆驼穿过针孔还难。在明白事情底细的观众看来（仲琦曾遇到的那位丑女，其实是淑娟的姐姐），韩仲琦此刻是误会了；可是，对于韩仲琦来说，他虔诚地相信，新娘就是他去年见过的那位越礼的丑女，此刻和她洞房花烛，发脾气尚且不暇，那还有心情再去仔细瞧她的“尊颜”！——一个怕羞，一个不愿，同房合卺，却有一条楚河汉界。显然，这条鸿沟不是作者硬给他们划出来，而是顺乎人物感情发展的一条“天堑”。
    不过，李笠翁如果仅仅只懂得和熟悉这对新人的心情，我想他还是算不了名家的。妙在他还善于运用戏曲舞台上常用的那把扇子。詹淑娟如果不遮着脸，那就不太像大家闺秀作新娘；韩仲琦不看见她也就不可能了。——那么，“误会”也就没有了，“戏”，也就完了。可是，按照生活和舞台上的惯例，入洞房以后的新娘子，既可以用红纱蒙脸，也可以背身而坐的。——设想一下，如果作者端的是这般处理，那就等于教人“不见庐山真面目”，戏剧效果将如何呢？作者的匠心，就在于他安排詹淑娟以扇子来遮脸。这不只描写了她的怕羞，而且正好遮住了韩仲琦的视线。可是，作者的安排，却没有遮住观众的视线。作者既照顾了台上，又清清楚楚向台下交代：詹淑娟是个正正经经、规规矩矩、漂漂亮亮的“青衣”角色。作者于是放开手，尽量去写韩仲琦如何把这位“青衣”设想成为一个“丑旦”。于是，韩仲琦越是憎恶、痛恨和嘲讽对方，台下的观众越是感到他的可笑。在这里，“戏”的全部关键就在一把奇妙的扇子上面。
    我想，假如我是一位小说作者，让我来写同样的故事，我一定会用许多插叙、补叙的笔墨来描述詹淑娟的品、貌如何，甚至加上作者的议论，来说明韩仲琦的幻觉；然而，在这个演出不过三刻钟左右的戏里，却不能许可作者这样做。当然，如果我是一位不高明的剧作者，一面用红纱蒙住新娘，一面也可以让丫环来唱上一段，介绍她小姐的为人如何；但是，丫环介绍的是真是假，不待剧终仍无法使人证实，而韩仲琦一连串的行动和言语，也只有待到剧终来判断是否可笑的了。于是，这就只能成为平铺直叙之文，而不是充满笑料的“戏”了。同时，让丫环来唱一段，既影响故事的进行，又影响主角的突出，是多么不经济啊！聪明的李笠翁，他在扇子上做出了文章，让观众看出一旁坐的是“青衣”，却让新郎去恚恨她是个“丑旦”，既收描写上的淋漓尽致之妙，又收结构上的精练简洁之功。其才思真有可学之处。
    就剧作的风格来说，李笠翁是比较纤巧的。但是，在纤巧之中，仍见一种巨大的魄力。这种魄力是：当他构思的时候，能够放着胆子把韩仲琦安排到和他主观想像截然相反的境遇中去描写——满以为是丑妇而其实是美人；满以为是不幸而其实却是喜事；……。这种善于抓住人物主观生活领域（幻觉、想像、愿望等等）和客观生活领域（处境）矛盾的本领，并不是笠翁一人所专有，而是一切古典作家共同的。川戏演出的“春灯谜”中，那位烂醉的书生，发现自己睡在最尴尬的地方——官家小姐的床上；谭记儿明知故犯地身入虎口——到望江亭上去见她誓不愿嫁、而对方却非得她不甘休的杨衙内，都说明了这个问题。要是韩仲琦一入洞房就看见詹淑娟的真面貌，那将没有“美洞房”这个戏；假如望江亭上不是想夺取谭记儿的杨衙内，而只是一位同样奉着势剑金牌来摘白士中官印的普通钦差，那么，这里就会缺少惊心动魄的场面。然而，如上所说，如果只知道这种矛盾，而不善于把詹淑娟是个“青衣”，杨衙内如何想得到谭记儿，十分具体地显示给观众，那还是构不成戏剧的。
    “吓！观看丑女子坐在一旁，用扇遮脸，假作含羞的样儿！丑女子呀丑女子！这是你天良发现，小小的扇儿，怎能遮得你那许多丑态哟！”
    这是韩仲琦在洞房后的一段独白。如果旁边坐的果真是一位丑女子，那么，这将成为一段平铺直叙的叙事文，有什么可谈之处呢？然而，在这里却成为笑料；看完了整折戏再来想一下，却耐人回味不已，其原因一言以蔽之，说话者的主观想法和客观实际有矛盾而已矣。“萝卜园”中，“小生下次再也不敢了！”是一句请求宽恕之词；然而，在这里，说此话者意在下次再也不敢“不告而出”去观灯；听此话者——他岳父却以为这是证实他——未婚婿和女儿偷情的招供。化腐朽为神奇，一句普通的语言，成为哄堂的材料，道理正和上面的情况是相通的。“穆桂英”中，桂英夸述自己当年如何破天门阵的大段唱词，如果安在别处，可能是很壮美的诗句，而不能成为“戏”；这里之成为精彩的一幕，不只在于唱词本身的气势磅礴，演员唱得够味，舞得使人眼花撩乱，还在于她越唱越是不自觉地走进在旁激将的寇准的计划中去了，而和佘太君的原意越来越相左了。这才是“戏”，才是“戏”中的语言。总之，戏中的好语言，必然有一股“弦外之音”；它的耐人寻味之处，总是和全剧的戏剧性分不开的。
    像“美洞房”这样的戏，当然是属于“传奇”一类。它虽然有些“无巧不成书”，但并不使人感到它的矫揉做作。从满面嗔怒，步法不正常的新郎一出场，观众就在奇怪了：为什么他这样不愿和詹淑娟结婚呢？（还有，为什么这段冤家对头似的婚姻，要取名“美洞房”呢？）……新娘见新郎独自去睡了，于是靦腆地回到她娘柳氏房中；柳氏因而来责问新郎，于是又回房去责问女儿做出丑事；问知底细，因而又去请问新郎，最后将女儿唤来“面相”，真相大白。……这里，情节曲曲折折，波澜纵横，看了前一场，不能不使人看第二场；而决不会使观众“抽签”——中途退席。同时，正是从现场这些曲折的情节里，作者又以虚笔写出了一段曲折的往事：放风筝、题诗、约会、惊丑、逼婚……。我想，作者在这里确实是写人物的；但是，他如果只着眼于人物，只求表现韩仲琦的幻觉与现实的背驰，那么，他完全可以作另外样子的处理：让发脾气的新郎去打下新娘手里的扇子；让丫环出来说破一切，等等。这样，也可以同样写韩仲琦忽然“诧美”的喜剧的。可是，笠翁在这里却不背剧中情理，卖了一下“关子”。他运用了剥茧抽丝的方法，一步步地，原原本本地，曲折地揭穿着“谜底”，也完成了人物描写。这样，才更使这个戏趣味盎然。诱人听闻的故事情节，在这里乃是必不可缺的。
