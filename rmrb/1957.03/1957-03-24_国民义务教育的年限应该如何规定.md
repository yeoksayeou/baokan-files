Chen Heqin, Lu Kanru, Lu Xiu, and Cao Shutian said in a joint speech: The length of national compulsory education develops along with the development of the national economy. As the national economic strength gradually increases, the length of compulsory education should also be gradually extended. At the same time, due to the uneven economic development in our country, the length of compulsory education should also vary according to the economic conditions of different regions. When these differences gradually disappear, the length can be unified, and people's opportunities for education can be equal.
    We fully support Chairman Mao's speech, Premier Zhou's political report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's meeting report.
    Today, we would like to talk about education issues that everyone is concerned about. Since liberation, China's cultural and educational construction has developed rapidly and achieved great results. Taking primary education as an example, the number of children enrolled has reached more than 63 million, more than double that before liberation. Such a rapidly developing cultural and educational construction can only be realized when the Chinese people are masters of their own affairs under the leadership of the Communist Party, which also fully proves the superiority of the socialist system.
    However, we are not without problems in our progress. At present, we still have a large number of school-age children who have not yet enrolled. This summer, we estimate that many graduates of senior primary schools will not be able to enter junior high schools, and junior high school graduates will not be able to enter senior high schools. Vice Premier Li Fuchun clearly pointed out that primary and secondary school graduates cannot all be promoted to higher levels at present, and the number of students at all levels of schools must form a pyramid shape for a considerable period of time, and he raised several important issues in the education system, especially the length of national compulsory education, asking us to discuss, study, and reconsider it.
　  I. Compulsory Education Can Only Be Developed Gradually
    Our constitution clearly stipulates that citizens of the People's Republic of China have the right to education. The state establishes and gradually expands various schools and other cultural and educational institutions to ensure that citizens enjoy this right. This provision of the constitution is in line with China's economic realities. Education is the superstructure of the social economy. Education must develop along with economic development. Under today's economic conditions, it is impossible for everyone to enroll in school, nor is it possible for everyone to go from primary school to junior high school, from junior high school to senior high school, and from senior high school to university once they enroll. Our education system should reflect this reality.
    In August 1951, the State Council of the Central People's Government passed and promulgated the "Decision on the Reform of the School System," which stipulated the primary school system of the People's Republic of China, namely, a five-year continuous system, and the age of admission for children was raised to seven years old. However, in the implementation, we found that this school system was not entirely suitable for China's specific conditions. The Ministry of Education also issued a circular in 1952 to temporarily suspend the implementation of the five-year continuous system for primary schools. We do not yet have a practical school system. The actual situation is that there are four-year primary schools and complete six-year primary schools.
    Article 29 of the Agricultural Development Program stipulates that primary school compulsory education should be popularized in seven or twelve years, depending on the circumstances of each region. Now we want to ask how many years of primary school compulsory education we have in China, four years, five years, or six years? This is not clear enough. Regarding the issue of the length of schooling, we are willing to put forward the following opinions on the issue of popularizing compulsory education in our country, based on the development of China's economy, the distribution of children in urban and rural areas, and with reference to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union: First, we all recognize that compulsory education develops along with the development of the national economy. As the national economic strength gradually increases, the length of compulsory education should also be gradually extended.
    Secondly, we all know that China is vast and populous, and the economic development between urban and rural areas is uneven. Not only that, but the economic development between cities and cities, and between villages and villages, is also uneven. It will take a considerable period of time to eliminate these economic differences. Therefore, during the transition period, the length of compulsory education should also vary according to the economic conditions of different regions. When these differences gradually disappear, the length of compulsory education can be unified, and people's opportunities for education can be equal.
    Regarding the issue of popularizing compulsory education, the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is worth learning from. Of course, we should not learn it dogmatically. Now let us briefly introduce it for your reference.
    On July 25, 1930 (thirteen years after the October Socialist Revolution, still in the transition period), the Central Committee of the CPSU announced the decision on popularizing compulsory education:
    Implement four-year primary school compulsory education in rural areas, and implement seven-year school compulsory education in cities and industrial and mining areas.
    The 18th Party Congress in 1939 proposed: (At this time, the Soviet Union had entered a socialist society)
    Implement seven-year school compulsory education in rural areas, and implement ten-year universal secondary education in cities. (Due to the Second World War, it could not be fully realized)
    The 19th Party Congress in 1952 decided:
    Implement ten-year universal compulsory education in cities and seven-year universal compulsory education in rural areas.
    The 20th Party Congress in 1956 (at this time, the Soviet Union was transitioning to a communist society) aimed to implement ten-year secondary compulsory education in urban and rural areas.
    From the above, the Soviet Union has successfully walked through this road of compulsory education. There is no doubt that we should learn from it. Six years ago, because we did not see the Soviet Union as clearly as we do today, and even more because we did not grasp the laws of development of communist education, which must be built on the basis of the national economy, proceeding from reality and seeking truth from facts, we took some detours at that time.
　  II. Suggestions on the Length of Compulsory Education in Various Periods
    How should we go in China? We suggest:
    1. Before the completion of a socialist society
    Generally, rural areas should gradually implement four-year school compulsory education, and some rural areas can also gradually implement six-year school compulsory education if economic conditions permit.
    Cities and industrial and mining areas should gradually implement six-year school compulsory education, and four-year school compulsory education can also be gradually implemented in areas with poor economic conditions.
    Rural children generally enter school at the age of eight, and urban children generally enter school at the age of seven. The age of admission can be flexibly controlled by the school to avoid mechanical implementation.
    2. After the country builds a socialist society (assuming from the fourth five-year plan in 1968)
    Generally, rural areas should gradually implement six-year school compulsory education, and some rural areas can also gradually implement nine-year school compulsory education if economic conditions permit.
    Generally, cities and industrial and mining areas should gradually implement nine-year school compulsory education, and six-year school compulsory education can also be gradually implemented in areas with poor economic conditions.
    The age of admission for rural children can be changed to seven, and the age of admission for urban children can be lowered to six.
    3. Starting from the mid-term of the transition to communism (assuming from the seventh five-year plan)
Rural areas should gradually implement nine-year or twelve-year school compulsory education.
    Cities and industrial and mining areas should gradually implement twelve-year or nine-year school compulsory education.
    The age of admission for rural children can also be lowered to six at this time.
    4. Starting from the eve of the transition to communism (assuming from the tenth five-year plan)
    Both rural and urban areas can gradually implement twelve-year secondary compulsory education.
    This drafted compulsory education system proceeds from a socialist standpoint, and changes according to the development of the national economy, and as the various differences between urban and rural areas, between cities and cities, and between rural areas and rural areas gradually change. As for the specific years of the four compulsory education stages mentioned, it will be determined based on future economic development.
    The above immature opinions we have put forward are mainly to answer the first two questions raised by Vice Premier Li: Should the age of admission in rural and urban areas be stipulated separately, and how should national compulsory education be stipulated, and how many years are appropriate for urban and rural areas?
　  III. Nine Opinions on Implementing the Compulsory Education System
    Now, in order to better implement the spirit of this drafted compulsory education system, and in order to answer the other four questions raised by Vice Premier Li, please allow us to briefly put forward the following simple specific suggestions:
    (1) In order to avoid confusion and maintain normal development, all schools at all levels and types (including kindergartens, primary schools, secondary schools, and universities) established before 1957 should continue according to the original plan and should not be changed.
      (2) In order to strengthen and accelerate the training of rural school teachers with sufficient quantity and devoted to teaching, we should establish junior and intermediate normal schools in townships that are completely in line with rural conditions, recruit graduates from senior primary schools and junior high schools, and teach four-year and six-year schools accordingly after two or three years of study.
      (3) In order to make intellectuals go to the countryside, make scientific knowledge take root in the countryside, and give students the opportunity to participate in labor production, we believe that the establishment of primary and secondary schools should be less concentrated in towns and more dispersed in the countryside. We can also combine the activities of rural central primary schools and rural middle schools with cultural and educational centers, agricultural extension stations, and health care stations, so that the entire rural area, including peasant women, children, students, etc., will be greatly encouraged and actively educated.
      (4) In order to strengthen the viewpoint of labor production, and in order to accelerate employment preparation, high primary school graduates and junior high school graduates in cities who cannot be promoted to higher schools should also be given one or two years of vocational technical education that combines theory with practice and is combined with social labor production at that time, so as to engage in industrial labor production. For high primary school and junior high school graduates in rural areas who cannot be promoted to higher schools, we should also give one or two years of spare-time agricultural education that combines the actual knowledge of rural production labor, so as to engage in agricultural labor production.
      (5) In order to protect young children and facilitate teaching, rural and urban primary schools should give priority to enrolling over-age children. As for young children over the age of twelve, they should be organized into separate classes for study, and should not study in the same class with normal school-age children, so as to avoid unnecessary obstacles in teaching and ideology.
      (6) In order to enable students at all levels and types of schools to reasonably enjoy the right to education, we believe that (1) except for normal schools and higher normal schools, all primary and secondary schools should continue to charge fees as usual, and other schools, including secondary technical schools and universities, should also charge tuition fees appropriately to enrich the current primary school funds. (2) It is stipulated that people's scholarships account for 20-30% of the total number of students. The acquisition of scholarships must meet two standards at the same time: (1) excellent academic performance. (2) economic hardship.
      (7) In order to enable more children in cities to have the opportunity to study, we believe that encouraging private donations to run schools should be actively carried out. In order to provide better schooling opportunities in rural areas, we believe that agricultural cooperatives with relatively affluent economies should actively start to carry out schools jointly run by the community and aided by the state.
      (8) In order to strengthen the importance of juvenile and children's work, trade unions and organizations of enterprises and institutions across the country should, under possible conditions, make full use of existing educational institutions and equipment, and allocate a certain amount of funds to absorb juvenile and children from outside the unit to expand the scope of services.
      (9) In order to better implement labor education and technical education, we believe that rural schools should pay special attention to two points:
      (1) Agricultural technical experience should be taught to students by the school organizing old farmers and gardeners, and material guarantees must be given to production labor, such as small farms on campus, etc.
    (2) The teaching plan must be combined with the rural economic situation and production labor. The spring and autumn agricultural holidays should be appropriately extended, and the winter and summer holidays should be appropriately shortened, so that children can directly participate in production labor to establish a production labor viewpoint and obtain certain production technical education.
    For schools in cities, we also believe that schools must be appropriately combined with the traditional handicrafts of the time and place, so as to engage in labor production.
    Whether the above opinions are appropriate, please criticize and correct them. (Attached picture)

### 国民义务教育的年限应该如何规定

　　国民义务教育的年限应该如何规定
　　陈鹤琴、陆侃如、陆秀和曹书田　在联合发言中说：国民义务教育是随着国民经济的发展而发展的，由于国民经济力量逐渐加强，义务教育年限也应逐渐延长。同时由于我国经济发展的不平衡，义务教育的年限也应该因地区的经济情况之差别而有所不同，等到这些差别逐渐消失的时候，其年限也就可以一致了，人民受教育的机会也就可以均等了。
    我们完全拥护毛主席的讲话，周总理的政治报告，李富春副总理的说明和陈叔通副主席的会务报告。
    今天我们想谈一谈大家所关心的教育问题，解放以来，我国文教建设事业有了飞跃的发展，获得了巨大的成绩。单就小学教育而言，目前入学的儿童已经达到六千三百多万，超过解放前一倍以上。这种飞跃发展的文教建设事业，只有在共产党领导下中国人民当家作主的时候，才有实现的可能，这也充分证明了社会主义制度的优越性。
    但是我们在前进中，并不是没有问题的，目前我们还有大量学龄儿童尚未入学。到了今年夏天，我们估计约有不少的高小毕业生不能升初中，初中毕业生不能升高中。李富春副总理对于这个问题明确地指出说：小学、中学毕业生目前无论如何不能全部逐级升学，各级学校学生人数必定在一个相当长的时期内形成宝塔式的形状，并提出了教育制度上的几个重要问题，特别是国民义务教育的年限问题，要我们大家讨论研究，予以重新考虑。
　  一、国民义务教育只有逐步发展
    我们的宪法明白规定：中华人民共和国公民有受教育的权利。国家设立并且逐步扩大各种学校和其他文化教育机关，以保证公民享受这种权利。宪法的这一规定，符合于中国经济的实际情况。教育是社会经济的上层建筑。教育事业必定是随着经济的发展而发展的。在今天的经济情况下，不可能人人都入学，也不可能一入学，都由小学而初中，由初中而高中，由高中而大学。我们的教育制度应该反映这种实际情况。
    在1951年8月中央人民政府政务院通过和公布了“关于改革学制的决定”，规定了中华人民共和国的小学制度，即五年一贯制，儿童入学年龄提高到七周岁。但在执行中，我们发现这一学制，不完全适合于我国的具体情况，教育部也在1952年通令全国暂时停止实行小学五年一贯制，我们目前还没有一个切合实际的学制，实际的情况是有四年制的小学和完全的六年制的小学。
    农业发展纲要二十九条规定说：按照各地情况，分别在七年或者十二年内普及小学义务教育。现在我们要问一问我国小学义务教育究竟是几年，四年呢五年呢还是六年，这是不够明确的。关于年限问题，我们愿意根据我国经济发展的情况，城乡儿童分布的情况，并参照苏联的先进经验，对我国的普及义务教育问题，提出下列意见：首先，我们大家认识到：义务教育是随着国民经济的发展而发展的，由于国民经济力量逐渐加强，义务教育年限也应逐渐延长。
    其次，我们大家也都知道：中国地广人众，城乡间经济发展是不平衡的，不但如此，城市与城市间，乡村与乡村间的经济发展情况也是不平衡的，要消灭这种种经济上的差别是需要一个相当长的时期的，因此在过渡时期内，义务教育年限也应该因地区的经济情况之差别而有所不同，等到这些差别逐渐消失的时候，义务教育年限也就可以一致了，人民受教育的机会也就可以均等了。
    关于普及义务教育这个问题，苏联的先进经验是值得我们学习的，当然我们不要教条主义地学习它，现在让我们把它扼要地介绍出来，供大家参考。
    1930年7月25日（在十月社会主义革命十三年后，还是在过渡时期）苏共党中央公布关于普及义务教育的决定：
    农村实行四年制的初等学校普及义务教育，城市和工矿区实行七年制学校普及义务教育。
    1939年党十八次代表大会提出：（这时苏联已进入社会主义社会）
    农村实行七年制学校普及义务教育，城市实行十年制普及中等教育。（因第二次世界大战，未能彻底实现）
    1952年十九次党代表大会决定：
    城市实行十年制普及义务教育，农村实行七年制普及义务教育。
    1956年二十次党代表大会，（这时苏联正在向共产主义社会过渡）在城市和农村以实行十年制中等义务教育为奋斗目标。
    从上看来，苏联对义务教育这条道路，已经胜利地走通了。毫无疑义，我们应当向它学习。六年前由于我们看苏联没有像今天看得那样清楚，更由于我们没有掌握住文化教育事业必须建筑在国民经济的基础上，从实际出发，实事求是的共产主义教育的发展规律，我们当时就走了一些弯路。
　  二、关于在各个时期义务教育年限的建议
    我们中国究竟应当怎样走呢？我们建议：
    一、在建成社会主义社会之前
    一般农村以逐步实行四年制学校义务教育为主，在经济条件许可下，有些农村也可逐步实行六年制学校义务教育。
    城市和工矿区以逐步实行六年制学校义务教育为主，在经济条件较差的地区，也可逐步实行四年制学校义务教育。
    农村儿童一般以八周岁为入学年龄，城市一般儿童入学年龄仍以七周岁为度，关于入学年龄，可由学校灵活掌握，以免机械执行。
    二、从国家建成社会主义社会后（假定从1968年第四个五年计划起）
    一般农村逐步实行六年制学校义务教育，在经济条件许可下，有些农村也可逐步实行九年制学校义务教育。
    一般城市和工矿区逐步实行九年制学校义务教育，经济条件较差的地区，也可逐步实行六年制学校义务教育。
    农村儿童入学年龄可改为七周岁，城市儿童入学年龄可降低为六周岁。
    三、向共产主义过渡的中期起（假定从第七个五年计划起）农村逐步实行九年制学校或十二年制学校义务教育。
    城市和工矿区逐步实行十二年制或九年制学校义务教育。
    农村儿童在此时期入学年龄也可降低到六周岁。
    四、从过渡到共产主义的前夕起（假定从第十个五年计划起）
    农村和城市都可逐步实行十二年制中等义务教育。
    这个草拟的义务教育制度是从社会主义立场出发，根据国民经济的发展情况，随着城市与农村间，城市与城市间，和农村与农村间的各种差别逐渐改变而改变的，至于所说的四个义务教育阶段的具体年限，是要根据以后经济发展情况而定的。
    以上我们所提出的一些不成熟的意见，主要是为答复李副总理所提的头两个问题的：就是农村和城市中的入学年龄是否应当分别规定和国民义务教育如何规定，城乡各以多少年为合适？
　  三、关于贯彻义务教育制度的九点意见
    现在为了更好贯彻这一草拟的义务教育制度的精神实质，并为了答复李副总理所提出的其他四个问题，请允许我们扼要地提出下面几个简单的具体建议：
    （一）为了避免混乱，保持正常发展起见，在1957年以前所办的各级各类学校（包括幼儿园，小学，中等学校和高等学校）仍照原计划进行，一律不予改动。
      （二）为了加强和加速数量足够的和专心教学的农村学校师资培养起见，我们应当在乡镇设立完全合乎农村情况的初级和中级师范学校，招收高小和初中毕业生，学习二年或三年后相应地教四年制和六年制学校。
      （三）为了使知识分子下乡，使科学知识在农村生根，并使学生有机会参加劳动生产，我们认为中小学校的设置应当少集中在城镇，多分散在农村。我们还可以把农村中心小学和农村中学与文教馆、农业推广站、卫生保健站的种种活动结合起来，使整个农村：包括农民妇女、儿童、学生等等在内，受到巨大的鼓舞作用和积极的教育作用。
      （四）为了加强劳动生产观点，并为了加紧就业准备，城市中的高小毕业生和初中毕业生不能升学者，我们也应再施一两年理论与实际相结合的也是与当时社会劳动生产相结合的业余技术教育，以便从事工业劳动生产。对农村不能升学的高小、初中毕业生，我们应再施一两年与农村生产劳动实际知识相结合的业余的农业教育，以便从事农业劳动生产。
      （五）为了保护年幼儿童，便利教学起见，农村和城市小学尽先招收超龄儿童，至于年满十二岁以上的少年儿童则另行组织班次学习，不得与正常学龄儿童同班学习，以免发生教学上和思想意识上不必要的障碍。
      （六）为了使各级各类学校学生对教育权利合理享受，我们认为（1）除师范学校和高等师范学校外，所有小学，中学照常收费，其他学校包括中等技术学校和高等学校也要一律酌收学费，以充实目前小学经费。（2）规定人民助学金占总学生人数20—30％，助学金的获得同时必须达到两个标准：（一）成绩优良。（二）经济困难。
      （七）为了使城市里有更多的儿童获得学习的机会，我们认为鼓励私人捐资办学，是应当积极进行的，为了使农村里有更好的就学机会，我们认为经济比较宽裕的农业合作社应当积极开始进行社办公助的学校。
      （八）为了加强重视少年儿童工作，全国各地工矿企业、工会组织和机关团体，在可能条件下，充分利用原有教育机构和设备，酌拨一定数量的经费，吸收非本单位的少年儿童，以扩大服务范围。
      （九）为了更好地实施劳动教育和技术教育，我们认为农村学校应特别注意两点：
      （1）对农业技术经验由学校组织老农老圃，向学生传授，并必须对生产劳动予以物质上的保证，如校园小型农场等。
    （2）教学计划必须与农村经济情况和生产劳动相结合，春秋农假适当地放长，寒暑假适当缩短，以便儿童直接参加生产劳动而建立生产劳动观点和获得一定生产技术教育。
    对城市中的学校，我们也认为学校必须适当地与当时当地的传统手工业结合起来，以便从事劳动生产。
    以上意见，是否有当，恳请同志们予以批评指正。（附图片）
