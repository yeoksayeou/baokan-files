Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 24th: Simplifying commonly used rice-washing methods can save a significant amount of grain. This is the conclusion reached by the Shanghai Municipal Grain Department after numerous experiments.

According to a survey conducted by the Municipal Grain Department at two hundred residential water stations in the Zhabei District, residents wash rice there every day, resulting in a thick sediment of rice starch, averaging 80,000 jin per month. Furthermore, according to an experiment conducted at a water station in the Guoqing Road 117 Lane Residents' Committee in this district, 750 jin of rice are washed there daily, resulting in 57 jin of settled, thick rice starch, averaging a loss of 7.6 jin of rice starch per 100 jin of rice. If we calculate that every 10 jin of rice yields 2.8 liang (after drying) of rice starch sediment, and the city's residents consume an average of 5 million jin of rice per day, the loss of rice starch would be 87,500 jin. The city would lose 31,937,500 jin of rice starch per year. To eliminate the waste and loss of grain, Shanghai People's Representatives Liu Liangmo, Peng Wenyin, and Da Yijin have suggested that all residents, mess halls, and grain-using industries adopt simplified rice-washing methods, which involve placing the rice in a bamboo sieve, picking out impurities, soaking it in water, stirring it by hand, and floating away debris, without vigorously scrubbing multiple times. This will both maintain nutritional value and comply with cleanliness and hygiene standards.

　　改进淘米方法可以节省粮食
    新华社上海24日电　人们习惯的淘米方法如果加以简化，就可以节省许多粮食。这是上海市粮食部门经过多次试验得出的结论。
    据市粮食部门在闸北区两百个居民给水站的调查，居民每天在那里淘米，积有浓厚的沉淀米浆，每月平均达八万斤。另据这个区国庆路一百十七弄居民委员会一个给水站的实验，那里一天淘米七百五十斤，积有沉淀的浓米浆五十七斤，平均每一百斤米损失米浆7.6斤。如果以每十斤米沉淀2.8两米浆（烘干后的分量）推算，全市居民平均每天消费五百万斤米，损失的米浆就有八万七千五百斤。全市一年就要损失米浆三千一百九十三万七千五百斤。为了杜绝粮食的浪费和损失，上海市人民代表刘良模、彭文应、笪移今曾建议全市居民、伙食团、用粮行业采用简化淘米方法，就是把米放在淘箩里，拣去杂质，浸水后用手搅拌，浮掉杂物，不用力多次洗擦。这样，既保持营养价值，又符合清洁卫生。
