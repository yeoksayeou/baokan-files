Xinhua News Agency, March 28th. The government delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic, headed by Prime Minister Široký, left Beijing this morning by special plane. The distinguished guests will visit various places in Northeast China before paying friendly visits to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Mongolian People's Republic.

A grand farewell ceremony was held at the Xijiao Airport in Beijing. Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a farewell speech first. He said: Prime Minister Široký and the government delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic are about to leave us. We are here to bid you farewell with reluctance.

Your visit to various places in China this time has expressed the Czechoslovak people's love for the Chinese people. At the same time, you have also seen the Chinese people's love for the Czechoslovak people. Therefore, your visit has given the Chinese people an extremely deep and unforgettable impression.

Your visit to China this time is not only a friendly visit, but you have also signed the Sino-Czech Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, the Sino-Czech Cultural Cooperation Agreement, and the Sino-Czech Health Cooperation Agreement with us. We also jointly issued a joint statement. We believe that the signing of these documents will help further consolidate the friendly unity between Czechoslovakia and China, help consolidate the unity between socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and help maintain world peace.

Finally, Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, wished the distinguished guests good health, happiness, and a safe journey.

Prime Minister Široký then delivered a speech. He said: We will continue our visit in the great People's Republic of China, and we will continue this friendly and fraternal visit. We cannot leave Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, before we thank your government and all the people of Beijing. At the same time, we must also thank you for the help and care you have given us during our stay in Beijing. Our farewell to you is like a farewell between brothers. Our thoughts and our hearts are forever connected.

Our goals of building socialism and communism are the same, and we share the common idea of consolidating the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

The documents we signed yesterday and published in the newspaper today will surely be received with joy by the people of our two countries. Of course, not only the people of our two countries, but all peace-loving, democratic, and progressive people in the world will welcome our documents.

Finally, Prime Minister Široký said in Chinese: "Goodbye!"

Those who went to the airport to see them off today included Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, and Peng Zhen, Vice Premiers Nie Rongzhen and Bo Yibo, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Cheng Qian, Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, and Long Yun, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Zhang Bojun, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, as well as heads of various departments of state organs, democratic parties, and people's organizations, generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life in the capital.

Czechoslovak friends in Beijing, heads of diplomatic missions and economic delegations of various countries to China, and diplomatic officials also went to the airport to see them off today.

Prime Minister Široký and his wife, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, arrived at the airport at 9:15 a.m. Here, the distinguished guests shook hands and said goodbye to Chinese and foreign people who came to see them off.

The band played the national anthems of Czechoslovakia and China, and Prime Minister Široký, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, reviewed the guard of honor.

After boarding the plane, he waved frequently to the well-wishers at the cabin door.
