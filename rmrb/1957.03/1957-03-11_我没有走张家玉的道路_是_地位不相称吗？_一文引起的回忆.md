Editor's Note: The article "Is It a Mismatch in 'Status'?", published in this newspaper on March 1st, has aroused great repercussions among readers. Zhang Jiayu's idea that marriage between intellectual men and working women is a "mismatch in 'status'," his backward thinking of looking down on labor and working people, and his act of abandoning his wife in violation of the marriage law, have been severely criticized by readers. Readers expressed great admiration for Gong Baomei's love for labor and her pure and faithful love, and expressed deep sympathy and concern for her misfortune. The following article is written by the author after reading "Is It a Mismatch in 'Status'?". He used to have Zhang Jiayu's backward thinking, but because he was a little more enlightened than Zhang Jiayu, his wife's hard work and pure and faithful love deeply moved him, and he stopped himself before taking Zhang Jiayu's backward path.

March 1st, a week before "March 8th" International Women's Day, the female classmates in my class were already preparing for how to celebrate the holiday. I have already written my congratulatory letter to my wife, and I can send it to the post office early tomorrow morning. Now, the People's Daily of the day is in front of me, and my eyes cannot leave the article "Is It a Mismatch in 'Status'?" for a long time. My thoughts are condensed on a painful past event. I seem to see my wife in Gong Baomei, and myself two years ago in Zhang Jiayu...

Counting from the time I married my wife, it has been eight years. However, we have only really had a happy life in the past year or two.

I used to live in a feudal big family. My mother died early, and my wife is a true rural woman. When she first came to my house, she just walked in and out silently. Whatever others did, she followed along without saying a word. Although she was illiterate, I only had a junior high school education at the time and worked as a clerk in an agricultural agency not far from home. I didn't seem to feel particularly dissatisfied. We had two children.

I love to study and have a lofty ideal. My education and professional skills are improving day by day. At this time, I also vaguely felt the "misfortune" of having such a wife.

In the summer vacation of 1954, I was admitted to a university. I was very happy for a while and didn't care about anything. After handling the handover in a hurry, I went to Beijing to study. Before liberation, I had only studied in elementary school. Although I had never stopped studying in spare-time schools after I started working, I was still struggling because my foundation was too weak. My head was dizzy all day long, and I didn't care about anything other than studying. The whole semester passed like this.

Not long after the second semester started, when I was studying hard, I received a letter from home. This was the first time I had received a letter from home after I left. The letter was sent by my wife, and the content was very simple: First, she told me that the family had separated and that only she and the two children were living together now. It is said that the reason for the separation was that my aunts and uncles disliked me for not earning money, and that the children and wife were a burden. Second, she told me that she had joined the cooperative. She didn't write anything else, only a sentence saying: "Everything is fine at home, don't worry."

This was a blow to me. I clearly realized that whether I lived with them or left, I had to be responsible for their lives. If I didn't give up my studies, there was no way to solve this problem. I was in a daze, and my heart was like fifteen buckets drawing water, all over the place. Soon I got sick. By the time I got better, it was already summer vacation. I bought a train ticket and went home. I didn't know what I was going to do when I got home, but I had to go home and see.

This was the summer vacation of 1955. I stayed at home for more than a month, and she didn't complain to me at all. But what a scene was in front of me! My wife had to make breakfast before others got up so that she could go to the fields with others. In the summer noon, the poisonous sun was so hot that even the sparrows were hiding in the leaves and dared not move. The farmers had to come back to eat and rest at this time. My wife, after returning, had to rush to cook and feed the children. Before she could clean up, it was time to go back to the fields. Therefore, she often had to cook more rice in the morning and leave some to eat when she came back at noon. Due to lack of sleep, her eyes were often swollen. I can't say why, but whenever I saw her dragging her heavy steps and walking back tiredly in the evening, I couldn't help but cook dinner early. Every time I saw this scene, her eyes always showed gratitude. Once, I seemed unable to restrain my feelings any longer and stepped forward to grab one of her hands; but when her calloused fingers were clenched in my hand, I couldn't help but let go again. How different this hand was from the hand I held when dancing, although I saw the pain in her eyes.

During the day, whenever she went to the fields, I would open a book and try to make up for the lessons I had missed last semester, but I couldn't concentrate on the book. Several times I couldn't help but shed tears silently against the wall. Was I confessing to her? It didn't seem like it. But more of it seemed to be why was she so "far" from me? And why did she have such a pure heart? Once, I was crying silently against the wall again, and I don't know when the older child ran into the room. Maybe my performance surprised the child, and he pulled my clothes and cried "Dad, Dad". I quickly wiped my eyes with my sleeve and hugged the child in my arms. The child's round little face was close to my chest, and his little eyes stared blankly at me. Outside the window, the setting sun had climbed halfway up the wall. Perhaps because people had all gone to the fields, there was no sound at all, only an old cicada was calling lonely. I also felt very lonely, and couldn't help but hug the child even tighter.

The whole summer vacation passed silently like this. I can't say what I did when I came back this time. My wife and I didn't talk about anything. When I left, she just said what she had said in the letter: "Everything is fine at home, don't worry when you leave."

On the way from home to the station, I had to pass by my aunt's house, so I went to see her. As soon as my aunt saw me, she said: "You have to study hard at school and save some money. Look how tired your wife is! Life is difficult after the family separated. She borrowed thirty yuan, and she hasn't paid it back yet." My head suddenly buzzed. She didn't say any of this. I stood up and wanted to run back, but it was almost time for the train to leave.

When I arrived at school, it was already dusk. I hurriedly tidied up my bed and opened the small package I had brought. Inside were clean shirts, two pairs of socks with new bottoms, and undershirts, etc. I took out a shirt to change into and unexpectedly took out twenty yuan from a small pocket. I was stunned. I immediately knew what was going on, but I was even more distressed. I could no longer control myself and immediately sent the money back to her, including the thirty yuan she owed others. I wanted to write a letter telling her everything in my heart, but I only wrote the sentence "I'm sorry to you and the children" before the paper was soaked with tears.

It's been more than a year since then. In the past year, I have studied harder and have achieved excellent grades every semester. As for my wife, she is also living well now. The cooperative in our village is already an advanced cooperative with more than a thousand households. The cooperative's nursery group is well run. Although we had a disaster there last year, she also received more than 260 yuan worth of labor fruits, which is enough for their living expenses. This winter vacation, I went home and spent the Spring Festival with them. Not long ago, she wrote to me saying: "Later, the work in the fields will be busy, and everyone is busy striving for this year's harvest, so I won't write many letters, don't worry about home." But I don't quite agree. I said: "Writing two more letters won't affect production, you can write shorter letters, and besides, you don't have to ask others to write letters for you now!..."

    我没有走张家玉的道路
    “是‘地位’不相称吗？”一文引起的回忆
    张志平
    编者按　3月1日本报刊登的“是‘地位’不相称吗？”一文，在读者中引起很大的反响。张家玉那种认为知识分子的男人和劳动妇女结成夫妇是“地位”不相称的思想，他轻视劳动和轻视劳动人民的落后思想和无理遗弃妻子的违反婚姻法的行为，受到读者严厉的指责。龚宝妹那种对劳动的热爱、对爱情的纯真忠实，读者表示了极大的敬佩，对她的不幸给与深切的同情和关怀。下面刊登的这篇文章，就是作者看了“是‘地位’不相称吗？”一文后所写的。他原来也有张家玉那种落后思想，但是由于他比张家玉觉悟高一点，他的妻子那种辛勤的劳动和纯真忠实的爱情，深深地感动了他，使他悬崖勒马，没有走张家玉那条落后的道路。
    3月1日，离“三八”节还有一星期，班里的女同学们又已经在筹备怎样过节了。我给妻子的贺节信已经写好，明天一早就可以交邮局发走。现在，我面前摆着当天的人民日报，我的目光久久不能离开“是‘地位’不相称吗？”这篇文章。我的思想在过去的一段沉痛的往事上凝结起来。我仿佛从龚宝妹身上看到了我的妻子，从张家玉身上看到了两年前的我。……
    我和妻子结婚算起来整整八年了。然而我们之间真正有幸福的生活还是近一两年来的事。
    我过去生活在一个封建的大家庭里，母亲早故，妻子是一个道地的农村妇女。初到我家的时候，每天只是默默地走进走出，别人干什么，她也一声不啃地跟着去。尽管她大字不识，但我呢，当时也只有高小程度，在离家不远的一个农业机关当科员，似乎也并没感到怎么样不得意。我们生了两个孩子。
    我很爱学习，并且有个远大的理想，我的文化程度和业务能力在一天天提高。就在这时，我也隐隐约约地感到有这样一个妻子的“不幸”。
    1954年暑假，我被录取入高等学校学习，一时非常高兴，什么也顾不得，匆匆忙忙办理交代后，就到北京就学了。解放前我只读过小学，参加工作以后，虽然从没间断在业余学校学习；但毕竟因为底子太薄，所以学习很吃力，整天头昏脑胀，学习以外的事，什么也顾不得。整整一学期都是这样过去的。
    第二学期开学不久，正当学习紧张的时候，我接到了一封家信，这是我离开家后第一次接到家里来信。信是妻子寄来的，内容很简单：第一告诉我家中分家了，现在只她和两个孩子一起生活。据说分家的原因是婶子大娘们嫌我不挣钱，剩下孩子和妻子是累赘。第二告诉我她已加入了合作社。其他什么也没写，只有一句话说：“家中没事，别惦记。”
    这对我简直是当头一棒。我清楚地意识到，不管我和她们一起生活或者是离开，她们的生活问题我都必须负责。如果不抛开学业，是无论如何也没法解决这个问题的。我懵懵憧憧的，整天心里像十五个吊桶打水，七上八下。不久我病了。病好的时候已是暑假，我买了张车票回家。当时自己也不知道回家要干什么，反正要回家看看。
    这是1955年的暑假。我在家住了一个多月，她根本没向我诉过一句苦。但摆在我面前的是怎样一幕情景啊！妻子每天必须在别人起床前把早饭做好，以便自己能和别人一起下地。夏天的中午，毒日头晒得麻雀都藏在树叶里不敢动，农民这时要回来吃饭歇晌。妻子呢，回来后要忙着做饭喂孩子。没有等到收拾清又到起晌下地的时候了。因此，她不得不常常在早晨多煮点饭，剩下些准备中午回来吃。由于睡眠不足，她的眼常常是浮肿着。我也说不清是为什么，反正几次看见她傍晚拖着沉重的步子，疲倦地走回来的样子，不由地自动提前煮好了晚饭。每看到这种情景，她眼睛里总是流露着感激的目光。有一次，我似乎再也按捺不住自己的感情，上前抓起了她的一只手；但当她那硬茧鳞鳞的手指一攒在自己手里的时候，我不由又放开了。这只手与跳舞时所握着的手是如何的不同啊，虽然我看到了她那痛楚的目光。
    白天，每当她下地以后，我一个人打开书本，想补一下上学期拖下的功课，但总不能把心放在书本上。有几次我不禁默默地对着墙壁落泪了。我是在向她忏悔吗？似乎又不是。但更多的似乎是她为什么和我距离这么“远”？而又有这么一颗纯真的心呢？一次，我又这样对着墙壁默默落泪，不知什么时候大孩子跑到屋里来了。也许我的表现使孩子吃惊了，竟拉着我的衣角“爸爸、爸爸”地哭了起来。我赶紧用袖子擦擦眼睛把孩子搂到怀里。孩子圆圆的小脸贴着我的胸前，小眼睛呆呆地望着我。窗外，西斜的太阳已经爬上半墙，大概是因为人们都到地里去了吧，一点声音全没有，只有一只老蝉在孤独地叫着。我仿佛也感到自己很孤独，不禁把孩子搂得更紧了。
    整个暑假就这样默默地过去了。我说不清这次回来究竟干了些什么，我和妻子都没有谈过什么问题，临别时她也还只是说了信上说过的那句话：“家中没事，走了别惦记。”
    从家里到车站要路过姑母家，顺便去看了看她。姑母一见我就说：“到学校要好好念书，要节省点，看你媳妇多累啊！分家后日子困难，借了三十块钱，到现在还没还清。”一时我的头突然嗡嗡地响了起来。这些她一点都没说。我站起来想跑回去，但开车的时间就要到了。
    到学校时，已是掌灯时候，我匆匆地整理好床铺，打开带来的小包袱，里面有洗干净的衬衫，新上好底的两双袜子和衬裤等。我拿出衬衫换上，竟从小口袋里掏出了二十元人民币。我不禁一怔，我马上清楚是怎么回事，但也更痛苦了。我再也不能控制自己，马上把钱给她寄了回去，包括她欠别人的三十元。我想写信告诉她我心中的一切，但我只写了一句“我对不起你和孩子”就被泪水把纸浸湿了。
    从那时候到现在又已一年多了。这一年多中，我学习更加努力了，每学期都获得了优良的成绩。至于我的妻子，现在也生活得很好，我们村的合作社已经是一个一千多户的高级社。社里的托儿组办得很好。去年我们那里虽然闹了灾，她还分到了价值二百六十多元的劳动果实，足够她们生活的费用。这次寒假我回家和她们一起过了春节。不久前她来信告诉我说：“以后地里活忙了，大家都在为争取今年的丰收忙碌着，所以不多写信了，别惦记家里。”但我不太同意，我说：“多写两封信影响不了生产，可以写短点，何况你现在写信又不用求别人了呢！……”
