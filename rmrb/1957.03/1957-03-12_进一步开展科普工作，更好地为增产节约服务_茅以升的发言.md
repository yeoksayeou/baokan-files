Now, I would like to introduce some information about a work with positive significance and broad impact regarding the issue of increasing production and practicing thrift. I also ask that all committee members and comrades provide guidance and assistance to strengthen and expand its role in increasing production and practicing thrift. This work is scientific and technological popularization work, hereinafter referred to as popular science work.

Popular science work is a symbol of a socialist country, developing along with the socialist cause. Therefore, in 1956, when China's socialist transformation entered an unprecedented high tide and the first Five-Year Plan victoriously moved towards its most intense stage, China's popular science work also experienced rapid and significant development. These developments have had a profound and extensive impact on the broad masses of workers and staff, and in many rural areas, reflected in increased labor productivity and an increasing number of rationalization proposals, thus playing a broad role in promoting increased production and practicing thrift. At the same time, under the call to advance towards science, this has also fueled the enthusiasm of the broad masses for loving science and learning science. Such an important weapon, born out of socialism and in turn serving socialism, is particularly worthy of attention and full utilization during our transition period.

The membership of the Science and Technology Popularization Association has grown to more than 180,000, and much work has been done in recent years.

Organized and regular popular science work in our country began after liberation. Not only have enterprises and cultural departments across the country gradually established this work, but more prominently, the nationwide China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, hereinafter referred to as the Association, has been established since 1950. Our Association is an amateur mass organization, and all members participate voluntarily and work on a voluntary basis. However, our work is regular, planned, and large-scale. At the end of 1955, five years after the establishment of our Association, we had 140 branches and sub-branches, and more than 38,000 members, who gave more than 10,000 lectures in that year alone. By 1956, all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country, except for Tibet and Taiwan, had branches, a total of 27, and a total of 983 sub-branches were established in counties and cities across the country. Moreover, the membership suddenly increased to more than 180,000. In that year, the Association gave more than 200,000 lectures, held more than 3,000 exhibitions, screened more than 11,000 science films, and published more than 3,000 kinds of pamphlets and publicity materials. The General Association alone published 248 kinds of popular science pamphlets, which were distributed 8.9 million copies. Therefore, 1956 was the fastest-growing year for our Association. Not only that, but the Association also did the following work this year: (1) Further cooperation with relevant agencies and organizations, such as jointly issuing the "Outline of the Collaboration Plan on Conducting Scientific and Technological Publicity Work for Employees in 1956" with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, jointly issuing the "Joint Notice on Strengthening Science Knowledge Lectures in the Troops" with the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, jointly issuing the "Joint Notice on Strengthening Forestry Publicity" with the Ministry of Forestry and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, jointly issuing the "Joint Notice on Carrying out Scientific and Technological Publicity Work in the Power System" with the Ministry of Electric Power Industry and the Electric Power Union, and jointly issuing the "Joint Notice on Making Full Use of Science Education Films and Slides to Strengthen Scientific and Technological Publicity Work" with the Ministry of Culture and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (At the beginning of this year, the Association jointly issued a notice on publicity work for the March 8th International Women's Day with the All-China Women's Federation and other organizations). (2) Held lectures on "New Achievements in World Science and Technology" for senior cadres and started preparing to compile a popular science knowledge series of "Must-Read for Cadres". (3) Launched two regular publications. One is the "Knowledge is Power" monthly magazine edited by the Association in cooperation with the Ministry of Labor for young workers, with a maximum circulation of 230,000 copies per issue. This was initiated and assisted by the "Knowledge is Power" editorial department of the Soviet Labor Reserve Department. The other is the "Learn Science" monthly magazine, edited by the Association for workers, peasants, and soldiers with a higher primary school education, with a circulation of more than 110,000 copies per issue. In addition, the Association already had two monthly magazines, "Popular Science" and "Science Pictorial", each with a monthly circulation of about 100,000 copies. Due to the increase in publications, the Association established the "Science Popularization Publishing House" this year. (4) At the end of October, jointly convened the "First National Congress of Activists in Scientific and Technological Popularization Work for Employees" with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. Activist conferences were held in 22 provinces, two autonomous regions, and three municipalities directly under the central government, and 39 cities under provincial jurisdiction elected or invited representatives, generating more than 1,000 attending delegates. During the six-day session, experiences were widely exchanged, and a letter was sent to employees nationwide, hoping to actively carry out popular science work. (5) In late September, jointly held the "Science Popularization Exhibition" with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in Beijing, lasting for one month, with more than 120,000 visitors. Now, these exhibits have been shipped to Dalian for exhibition and are also prepared to be shipped to Sichuan for a roving exhibition. In addition, in June, it assisted the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade in jointly holding the "Soviet Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy Exhibition" and organized members of the physics and chemistry aspects of 27 branches and 14 sub-branches across the country to visit Beijing. (6) The "Planetarium" is being built opposite the Beijing Zoo in the western suburbs, with a "Planetarium Hall." On the circular roof, "movies" of the sun, moon, and stars are projected, showing the changes of each month and the four seasons of the year in a few minutes. You can also know the sky thousands of years ago and thousands of years later. The museum covers an area of ​​50,000 square meters and has exhibition halls, lecture halls, and an observatory and meteorological station. This planetarium will open this fall. In addition, the Association received the "Ancient Observatory" at Paozihe in the eastern city of Beijing and established the "Exhibition Hall of Ancient Astronomical Instruments." More than 30,000 people visit it throughout the year, and an observation of Mars was organized in September, with more than 13,000 viewers.

The publicity methods of combining production, combining reality, and going deep into the masses are welcomed by the broad masses.

Since the task of the Association is to publicize science and technology to the broad masses to improve production capacity and eliminate superstition, its publicity policy must be combined with production and reality, and the publicity methods must go deep into the masses, adopting various methods that are small, diverse, easy to understand, and voluntarily absorbed. In addition to regularly holding larger-scale lectures, systematic lectures, science films, and various large and small exhibitions in cities, it is also necessary to conduct regular lectures and sustained publicity in the large and small workshops of factories and mines, in the cultural centers of urban and rural areas, and even in rural areas. In addition, it is also necessary to publish a large number of publications, such as periodicals, tabloids, pamphlets, series, and various publicity materials, to meet the needs of the broad masses. These publicity works, including the selection of topics for lectures, writing, reviewing, trial lectures, and even formal publicity, the production of image data for exhibitions, the editing, translation, and drawing of films and slides, the writing and speaking of broadcasts, etc., are all actively supported by relevant parties, and the broad members of the Association, under the leadership of organizations at all levels, use their spare time, participate in various work groups, and persevere in their work, which is warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the people. For example, from September to December last year, the Association members' working group of the Qingdao Bicycle Factory conducted 176 lectures on the key issues existing in production, so that almost 100% of the factory's workers participated in the study and achieved improvement. Another example is that Shuangde Township, Fengli District, Rudong County, Jiangsu Province, has one member of the Association and two propagandists. In the past four months, they gave 28 lectures, with 1,260 listeners. They also spread agricultural knowledge to teachers in civil schools, who then returned to their schools to publicize it. Some members and propagandists in districts and townships have also established working groups in rural areas and signed long-term lecture contracts with local agricultural cooperatives. Such high enthusiasm of members for popular science work may seem a little strange at first, but on the basis of increased political awareness, it is easy to understand the combination of the interests of popular science work for the people and for themselves, and to realize that the scientific knowledge from the masses is spread to the masses again through their own labor, thus accelerating socialist construction so that their work can also be more effective and improve their own scientific level, which is a clear path to cultivating and training socialist intellectuals. This ideological situation is most concentratedly reflected in the "study group" organization of the Association. In order to improve the quality of publicity and learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, the Association has organized scientists with higher levels among its members into various study groups according to disciplines to undertake the tasks of topic selection, planning, writing, and reviewing related publicity, forming various publicity staff departments. The General Association and larger branches of the Association have successively established many study groups. As far as the General Association is concerned, there are now 21 study groups in medicine, agriculture, forestry and water conservancy, industrial technology, and basic science, with a total of 467 study group members, including university professors, research institute researchers, industrial sector engineers, hospital directors and chief doctors, and some heads of industrial, agricultural, and enterprise departments. Among the members are 15 academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. They are all very busy scientists, but they all love popularization work and voluntarily devote themselves to the ranks of "popular science."

Of course, relying solely on the enthusiasm of the members, the Association could not have achieved the above achievements. Summarizing the experience of the past seven years, we feel that the reason why we have been able to make some contributions is mainly due to the care, leadership, and support of the Party and the government for our work, followed by the help and cooperation of relevant agencies and organizations, especially the assistance of organizations in all aspects of industry, agriculture, culture, and education throughout the country. At the same time, the national scientific community, through production, education, research, and other institutions, as well as various specialized societies, attaches importance to and supports our work, thus strengthening the scientific nature of publicity materials, which is also an important condition for us to develop our business. All of these are very valuable to our amateur group and give us great courage and confidence on the road to progress. We believe that although there are still many shortcomings in the work of our Association that need to be corrected, and in such a large country with our 600 million population, the work we have already done is only a drop in the ocean, but in the great socialist construction of our motherland, the development of our Association will definitely be the same as all other organizations engaged in popular science work, with unlimited bright prospects.

Opinions on further carrying out scientific and technological popularization work.

Finally, in order to further develop popular science work and better serve increased production and thrift, on behalf of our Association, I would like to put forward the following wishes and requirements to all parties concerned about our work: (1) The grass-roots Party organizations of all factories and mines should strengthen the leadership of the Association's grass-roots organizations, and it is hoped that Party committees at all levels will include the leadership work of the Association on the Party's work agenda. (2) All agencies and organizations cooperating with the Association should conduct top-down cooperation throughout the entire system, and combine the publicity work of their own system with the publicity work of the Association system equally, closely, and regularly. (3) All production and enterprise departments should vigorously and widely carry out various kinds of technical amateur education, cooperate with popular science work, drive each other, assist each other, and accelerate the improvement of the scientific and technological level of employees. (4) The national scientific community, especially the specialized societies, should give the Association more and greater guidance and assistance, and mobilize more scientific and technological personnel to participate in the Association's work and expand the popular science team. (5) The national workers and peasants should actively participate in popular science education, cooperate closely with scientific and technological workers and popular science organizers, expand the role of popular science, persevere in hard study, transform knowledge into power, increase production and practice thrift, and overfulfill the great task of the first Five-Year Plan!

    进一步开展科普工作，更好地为增产节约服务
    茅以升的发言
    现在，我想就增产节约问题，对于一项具有积极意义和广泛影响的工作，介绍一些情况，并请各位委员、同志们予以指教和帮助，来加强和扩大它在增产节约中的作用。这项工作就是科学技术普及工作，以下简称科普工作。
    科普工作是社会主义国家的一个象征，是随着社会主义事业的发展而发展的。因此，在1956年我国社会主义改造事业进入空前高潮、第一个五年计划胜利地走向最紧张阶段的时候，我国科普工作也有了突飞猛进的巨大发展。这些发展已经在广大职工群众中，并在不少农村里，有了深广的影响，反映在提高了的劳动生产率和日益增多的合理化建议上，因而对于增产节约起了广泛的推动作用。同时，在向科学进军的号召下，这也助长了广大群众的爱科学、学科学的热潮。像这样一个诞生于社会主义、转而为社会主义服务的重要武器，在我们过渡时期，是特别值得重视而充分利用的。
    科学技术普及协会会员已发展到十八万多人，几年来作了许多工作
    有组织的、经常性的科普工作，在我国是解放以后才有的。不但各企业和文化部门，在全国范围内，都已在陆续建立起这项工作，而且比较突出的，是从1950年起，就有了全国性的中华全国科学技术普及协会，以下简称协会。我们这个协会是一个业余性的群众团体，所有会员都是自愿参加而义务劳动的。但我们的工作却是正规的，有计划的而且是大规模的。在1955年底，我们协会在成立了五年以后，就有了一百四十个分会和支会，三万八千多会员，在那一年就做了一万多次的演讲。然而到了1956年呢，我们在全国各省市和自治区，除了西藏和台湾外，都一律有了分会，共二十七个，在全国各县市，总共建立了九百八十三个支会，而且会员突然增加到十八万多人。在这一年，协会做了二十多万次演讲，举办了三千多次展览，放映了一万一千多次科学电影，出版了三千多种小册子和宣传资料，内仅总会出版的二百四十八种普及科学的小册子就发行了八百九十万册。因此，1956年是我们协会发展得最快的一年。不但如此，在这一年内协会还做了以下的这些工作：（1）与各有关机关、团体有了进一步的合作，如与全国总工会联合发出了“关于1956年对职工进行科学技术宣传工作的协作计划纲要”，与解放军总政治部联合发出了“关于加强部队科学知识讲座的联合通知”，与林业部和团中央联合发出了“关于加强林业宣传的联合通知”，与电力工业部和电力工会联合发出了“关于在电力系统开展科学技术宣传工作的联合通知”，与文化部和全国总工会联合发出了“关于充分利用科学教育影片和幻灯片以加强科学技术宣传工作的联合通知”（今年初，协会又同全国妇联等团体联合发出了关于三八国际妇女节的宣传工作的通知）。（2）为高级干部举办了“世界科学技术新成就”讲座，并着手筹备编写 “干部必读”的通俗的科学知识丛书。（3）创刊了两种定期刊物，一是协会和劳动部合作，为青年工人编辑的“知识就是力量”月刊，每期发行数最高到二十三万册，这是由苏联劳动后备部的“知识就是力量”编辑部创议并协助而出版的；一是“学科学”月刊，是由协会为高小程度的工农兵编辑的，每期发行数已达十一万多册。此外，协会原有“科学大众”和“科学画报”两种月刊，每种每月发行数都在十万册左右。由于刊物增多，协会在这年成立了“科学普及出版社”。（4）在10月底与全国总工会联合召开了“全国第一次职工科学技术普及工作积极分子大会”，由全国二十二个省、两个自治区、三个直辖市及三十九个省辖市开了积极分子大会选举或采用邀请方式，产生了出席代表一千多人，在六天的会期中，广泛地交流了经验，并向全国职工发出了一封信，希望积极开展科普工作。（5）在9月下旬与全国总工会在北京联合举办了“科学普及展览会”，为期一个月，参观者有十二万多人。现在，这些展览品已运往旅大市展出，还准备运往四川，作巡回展出。此外，在6月间，还协助中国科学院、对外贸易促进委员会联合举办了“苏联和平利用原子能展览会”，并组织了全国二十七个分会和十四个支会的理化方面的会员们来京参观。（6）在北京西郊动物园对面兴建起“天文馆”，内有“天象厅”，在圆形屋顶上，放映日月星辰运行的“电影”，在几分钟内看到每月和一年四季的变化，还可以知道几千年以前和几千年以后的天空。这个馆占地五万平方公尺，设有展览厅，讲演厅，还有天文台和气象台。这个天文馆将于今年秋季开幕。此外，协会于北京东城泡子河，接收了“古观象台”，成立了“古代天文仪器陈列馆”，全年有三万多人参观，并于9月间组织了一次火星观测，观众有一万三千多人。
    结合生产、结合实际、深入群众的宣传方法，受到广大群众的欢迎
    由于协会的任务是向广大群众宣传科学技术，来提高生产能力，破除迷信，因而它的宣传方针就必须结合生产，结合实际，而宣传方式就要深入群众，采取小型多样，通俗易懂，自愿吸取的各种方法；除了在城市经常举办较大规模的讲演会、系统讲座、科学电影、及各种大小型展览外，还要在工厂矿山的大小车间里，城乡的文化馆里，甚至农村场地上，进行定期讲演，持久宣传。此外，还要出版大量刊物，如期刊、小报、小册子、丛书和各种宣传资料，以供广大群众的需要。这些宣传工作，包括讲演的选题、编写、审查、试讲以至正式宣传，展览的形象资料的制作，电影、幻灯片的编辑、翻译和绘制，广播的写稿和讲话等等，都是在有关各方的积极支持下，由协会的广大会员在各级组织领导下，就业余时间，参加各样工作小组，坚持不懈地进行的，受到广大人民群众的热烈欢迎。如青岛自行车制造厂的协会会员工作组从去年9月至12月，针对生产上存在的关键问题，进行了一百七十六次的讲演，使全厂工人，几乎百分之百地都参加了学习，得到了提高。又如江苏如东县丰利区双德乡有协会的会员一人，宣传员二人，在去年四个月中就讲演了二十八次，有听众一千二百六十人。他们还向民校教师传播农业知识，由教师回校宣传。还有些在区乡的会员和宣传员，在农村成立了工作组，和当地的农业合作社订了长期讲演合同。会员们对科普工作这样高的积极性，乍听起来好像有些奇怪，但他们在提高了的政治觉悟上，很容易明了科普工作对人民和对自己的利益的结合，认识到把群众中来的科学知识，通过自己的劳动，再传播到群众中去，因而加速社会主义建设使自己的工作也能更有成效，并提高自己的科学水平，是培养锻炼成为社会主义知识分子的一个鲜明道路。这种思想情况最能集中表现在协会的“学组”组织上。协会为了提高宣传质量，学习苏联先进经验，把会员中水平较高的科学家们，按照学科，组成各种学组，担负有关宣传的选题计划、写稿、审稿等任务，形成各种宣传的参谋部。协会的总会和较大的分会都先后成立了不少的学组。就总会来说，现已有了医学、农林水利、工业技术和基础科学各方面的学组二十一个，共有学组委员四百六十七人，包括大学教授、研究所研究员、产业部门工程师、医院院长和主任大夫和一些工农企业部门的负责人。委员中有中国科学院的学部委员十五人。他们都是工作极忙的科学家，但都热爱普及工作，自愿投身到“科普”的行列中来。
    当然，光靠会员们的积极性，协会是不可能取得以上这些成绩的。总结七年来经验，我们感觉到我们之所以能有所贡献，主要是由于党和政府对我们工作的关怀、领导和支持，其次是各有关的机关、团体的帮助和合作，特别是全国各地工农业和文教各方面的组织的协助。同时，全国科学界，通过生产、教育、研究等机构以及各专门学会，重视和支援我们的工作，因而加强了宣传品的科学性，也是我们发展业务的一个重要条件。所有这些，对于我们这样一个业余团体来说，都是非常宝贵的，给了我们在前进道路上的很大勇气和信心。我们相信，虽然我们协会的工作中还有很多缺点需要纠正，而且在我们六亿人口这样的大国中，我们已有的工作还只是沧海一粟，但是在我们祖国的伟大社会主义建设中，我们协会的发展，一定是会同所有其他科普工作的各项组织一样，具有无限的光辉前途的。
    进一步开展科学技术普及工作的意见
    最后，为了进一步开展科普工作，更好地为增产节约服务，我代表我们协会，向关心我们工作的各方面，提出下列愿望和要求：（1）各厂矿企业的基层党组，加强对协会基层组织的领导，希望各级党委把对协会的领导工作列入党的工作日程上。（2）与协会合作的各机关、团体，进行自上而下的整个系统的合作，把自己系统的宣传工作与协会系统的宣传工作，对等地、密切地、经常地结合起来。（3）各生产企业部门大力广泛地开展各种各样的技术业余教育，与科普工作配合，彼此带动，相互协助，加速提高职工群众的科学技术水平。（4）全国科学界，特别是各专门学会，给协会更多更大的指导和帮助，并动员更多的科学技术人员参加协会工作，扩大科普队伍。（5）全国工农群众积极参加科普教育，与科学技术工作者和科普组织工作者密切合作，扩大科普作用，坚持顽强学习，化知识为力量，增产节约，超额完成第一个五年计划的伟大任务！（附图片）
