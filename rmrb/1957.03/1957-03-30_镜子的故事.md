　　The Story of Mirrors
　　Gao Shiqi
    According to reports: Last December, thirteen ancient Chinese bronze mirrors were discovered in an ancient tomb in Okayama City, central Honshu, Japan. It is estimated that they are more than 1,800 years old. These ancient mirrors are round, patterned, and made of bronze.
    Bronze mirrors are the ancestors of mirrors, and their discovery has always been valued by archaeologists.
    More than a hundred years ago, archaeologists found a metal disc with a handle in a tomb in Egypt. It was rusty, and people at the time did not know what the disc was for.
    Some said: This disc was used to replace a fan; others said: it was a kind of decoration; and still others said: it was a baking pan for baking cakes.
    Later, after testing, it was confirmed that this was a bronze mirror.
    In ancient times, in addition to bronze mirrors, there were also silver mirrors made of silver and steel mirrors made of steel. However, these metal mirrors would become dark and rusty when exposed to moisture, losing their original appearance. In order to avoid this, it is necessary to prevent its surface from coming into contact with air and moisture. This requires the use of glass to manufacture it.
    From metal mirrors to glass mirrors, mirrors have gone through an interesting history.
    Before people learned how to make glass, they did not know how to make glass mirrors.
    The Venetians were experts in making glass, and they were the first to invent the manufacture of glass mirrors. Their method was to bond mercury amalgam, an alloy of mercury and tin, to glass. They had always kept this secret.
    As a result, European princes, nobles, and wealthy people went to Venice to order mirrors.
    The Queen of France, Marie de Medici, was given a glass mirror as a gift by the Republic of Venice when she got married. Although this mirror was very small, it is said that its price was worth 150,000 francs. The Queen loved it very much.
    A love of mirrors became a fashion. Mirrors became a symbol of ostentation. The nobles of the time competed to buy a delicate mirror, preferring not to buy anything else.
    From then on, France's money flowed to Venice.
    In order to reverse this trend, the French ambassador to Venice was secretly ordered to buy two or three mirror-making technicians and secretly transport them to France.
    Soon after, a glass mirror factory was also established in Normandy, France.
    More and more people in France wanted to buy mirrors. Wealthy people wanted to get a mirror for their homes. People began to use mirrors to decorate beds, dining tables, chairs, and cabinets. Even small mirror pieces were sewn onto dresses, so that they would sparkle under the lights when dancing. This was truly beautiful!
    The need for mirrors increased year by year, but their quality was still very poor. The surface of the glass was uneven, and the faces reflected were distorted and incorrect, and the mirrors were very small, unable to reflect the whole body.
    So people longed for the appearance of large glass mirrors.
    The credit for making large glass mirrors belongs to the French. However, making large glass mirrors required large glass sheets, and grinding and polishing the glass sheets was a very delicate and heavy task. This work was laborious and time-consuming, so the price of large glass mirrors was very expensive.
    Fortunately, today, people have invented a method of grinding glass with machines, and can even automate this method. This has greatly reduced the price of mirrors, and ordinary people can afford them.
    The manufacturing method of glass mirrors is becoming more and more perfect, and its uses are becoming wider.
    People no longer use mercury amalgam, but coat a thin layer of silver on the glass plate, and then coat a layer of paint on top of it to protect the silver. Mirrors made in this way reflect very clearly.
    Now people can make a new type of glass that looks like a mirror on one side and transparent glass on the other. Putting this glass on a car allows you to browse the scenery and people outside the window, while passers-by cannot see you, they can only see themselves.
    The progress of science and technology is truly exciting.

　　镜子的故事
　　高士其
    报载：去年12月日本本州中部冈山市的一个古墓里发现十三面中国古代铜镜，估计有一千八百多年的历史，这些古镜呈圆形、有花纹，都是用青铜制成的。
    青铜镜是镜子的祖先，它的发现一向为考古学家所珍视。
    考古学家在一百多年以前，就在埃及一座坟墓里找到一个有柄的金属圆盘，已经生锈，当时人们不知道这个圆盘作什么用。
    有的说：这个圆盘是用来代替扇子的；有的说：它是一种装饰品；又有的说：这是一个烤饼的烤盘。
    后来经过试验证实，这是一面青铜镜子。
    古时候，镜子除了用青铜制造的以外，还有用银子制造的银镜、用钢制造的钢镜。但是，这些金属镜子，一遇到潮湿就会发暗生锈，失去本来面目。为了避免这一点，就不能让它的表面同空气和水分接触。这就需要用玻璃来制造了。
    从金属镜到玻璃镜，镜子走了一段有趣的历史。
    在人们还没有学会作玻璃以前，是不懂得制造玻璃镜子的。
    威尼斯人是制造玻璃的能手，首先发明制造玻璃镜子的也是他们。他们的制法是把水银和锡的合金——汞合金，和玻璃粘在一起。他们一直保守着这种秘密。
    于是，欧洲的王公贵族，阔佬名人都到威尼斯去订购镜子。
    法国有个女王叫做玛丽·麦迪奇，在她结婚的时候，威尼斯共和国曾献给她一面玻璃镜子作为礼物，这面镜子虽然小的很，据说它的价钱却值十五万法郎哩。女王很爱它。
    爱好镜子竟成了一种风气。镜子变成一种显耀的东西。当时的贵族都争先恐后地宁愿什么都不买，却一定要买一面玲珑的镜子。
    从此，法国的金钱都流到威尼斯去了。
    为了挽回这种利益，法国驻威尼斯大使奉到密令，叫他收买两三名做镜子的技师，把他们偷偷地运到法国去。
    不久之后，在法国诺曼第地方也建立了一座制造玻璃镜子的工厂。
    法国爱买镜子的人更多起来了。有钱的人都想给自己家里弄到一面镜子。人们开始用镜子装饰床铺、餐桌、椅子和橱柜。甚至于在礼服上也缝上小镜子片，使跳舞的时候，在灯光照耀之下闪闪烁烁地发光。这真是美丽呀！
    镜子的需要一年比一年增加，但是它的质量还很低劣，玻璃表面不平，照出来的嘴脸歪曲不正，而且镜子都很小，不能照全身。
    于是人们渴望着有大玻璃镜的出现。
    制造大玻璃镜之功，是属于法国人的。但是，制造大玻璃镜就需要用大玻璃板，而把玻璃板磨平和磨光是一件十分细致和沉重的工作，这种工作既吃力又费时间，结果大玻璃镜的价钱就非常昂贵了。
    幸而在今天，人们已经发明一种用机器磨玻璃的方法，而且还能使这种方法自动化。这样就使镜子的价格大跌，一般平民也都买得起。
    玻璃镜子的制法越来越完善，它的用途也越广。
    人们已经不再用汞合金了，而是在玻璃板上涂了一层薄的银子，在它的上面又涂上一层漆来保护这层银子。这样制成的镜子，照出来的影子非常清楚。
    现在人们已经能造出一种新式玻璃，一面看去是镜子；一面看去是透明的玻璃。把这种玻璃装在汽车上，就使你能浏览窗外的风光人物，而过路的人不能望见你，只能看见他自己。
    科学技术的进步真令人兴奋。
                  1957、3、27。
