I wholeheartedly endorse Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference and Premier Zhou's report, and I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of the Second Five-Year Plan and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report.

Now I would like to express some immature opinions on the question of "how to unleash the potential of university teachers in scientific research."

Since the slogan "March towards science" was put forward last year, intellectuals in various places have been working actively in response to this call. However, at the same time, two abnormal ideological situations have emerged.

The first type of person sees that the government attaches importance to scientific research and calls for marching towards science. As a result, teachers in universities and middle schools, or cadres in government departments, all want to engage in scientific research and are unwilling to teach or do other work. In this way, everyone is uneasy in their current positions, and a phenomenon of unconsolidated professional thinking has formed, especially among graduates of normal colleges who are unwilling to become middle school teachers. Their first wish is to take the postgraduate entrance examination and enter the Academy of Sciences to prepare for the title of associate doctor; the second is to stay in universities as teaching assistants. As for becoming a middle school teacher, they think it is the most unpromising thing. Why do they attach so much importance to research work? Because research papers are published, which can not only bring honor but also a lot of royalties. It is really a win-win situation! But as a middle school teacher, one will still be a middle school teacher for life, and the highest salary is only a little over one hundred yuan.

The other type of person, although they also want to do some research, are too busy with heavy teaching tasks, and the time is wasted bit by bit. They have not arranged their working time well and systematically. Since they don't have time to do research, they are perfunctory and muddle along, and don't want to do research anymore.

I think both of these ideas are incorrect. If everyone just sits there and specializes in research work, then who will take on the teaching work? Conversely, if university teachers only teach and do not engage in research work, how will the quality of teaching be improved? I think university teachers should both teach and do research. Use the insights gained from research to enrich the content of teaching, so as to improve the quality of teaching. This is the characteristic of universities, and only in this way can it be called a university. Therefore, university teachers, from teaching assistants to professors, should engage in research work in addition to teaching work. If we don't do this, and we push the work of scientific research to a few people in the Academy of Sciences, it is not enough for our country with a population of 600 million to rely on a few scientists in the Academy of Sciences to shoulder this burden. We must mobilize all university teachers to actively unleash their potential to engage in scientific research, and then we may be able to catch up with the world's advanced scientific level in twelve years.

Of course, university teachers should do research work. Everyone thinks and says this, both in the past and now, and the Party and the government also call for it. However, in fact, the research work of universities is not carried out well enough, that is to say, there is still a lot of potential that has not been unleashed. Why? I think the following points are worth our attention.

First, reduce the teaching tasks of teachers.

It is no problem that university teachers must teach. However, in this transitional period, teaching requires self-compiled teaching materials. Generally, teachers spend most of their time compiling teaching materials, and the Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education stipulate that the time for compiling teaching materials is not only not counted as workload, but also not counted as working days. As for the time for scientific research, it can only be counted as working days, but not as workload. Therefore, teachers must teach enough to meet the prescribed workload, they must take on more courses and meet with students more often. In this way, it is impossible to have much time to engage in research work. Regarding this issue, teachers cannot help but have doubts: why can't the research work of university teachers be counted as workload? University teachers have already undertaken heavy teaching work, and they can still squeeze out some time to engage in scientific research in addition to teaching, which is worthy of praise and encouragement. Why is their hard work time not counted as workload? That is to say, only teaching time can be counted as workload in universities, and research work cannot be counted as workload. Then, according to what will the workload of researchers in the Academy of Sciences be calculated? If this is the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, then we don't necessarily have to learn it dogmatically. Because in Soviet universities, teaching has textbooks and reference books, and teachers do not need to compile their own teaching materials. Moreover, Soviet teachers have high standards and do not spend a lot of time preparing lessons. Therefore, in addition to teaching, they have extra time to do research work. We cannot do this. We have to compile teaching materials for teaching, and we have to spend more time preparing lessons. Few of our teachers can read Russian reference books, and the translated versions are often unclear in meaning, and we don't know what the original meaning is. Naturally, we have to spend more time to prepare a class. Therefore, my solution to this problem is to hope that the number of students enrolled in the future should not be too large, and should be adapted to the strength of the teachers. Also, more teaching assistants should be retained in universities, and young teachers should be cultivated more. With more teachers, the teaching time of teachers can be appropriately reduced, and more time can be squeezed out to engage in scientific research work, and the research time can be counted as workload. This will greatly encourage scientific research work in universities.

Second, enrich the equipment for research work.

Today, the equipment for scientific research in various universities is generally very poor. Of course, teachers should also create conditions for their own scientific research work under the principle of increasing production and practicing economy, but necessary and relatively precise instruments that cannot be made by themselves must be appropriately supplemented. The most important thing is reference materials, which is the most difficult thing to solve in today's march towards science. Because reference materials for research often require old magazines in various languages. Some of these materials are out of print and not easy to buy. Here I would like to suggest that the national publishing organs can plan and step-by-step reprint multiple sets of relatively valuable series and magazines collected from home and abroad, so that universities can purchase and use them separately (I heard that the government already has this plan, and I hope it can be realized soon).

Third, ensure a certain amount of research funding.

Of course, we must also implement the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy for every penny we spend on research work. However, necessary funding cannot be saved. We hope that a research fund will also be stipulated in universities to ensure that the proposed research plan will not be unable to be completed due to lack of funds. Fourth, I hope that the Academy of Sciences can have more contact with various universities.

The Academy of Sciences has had some contact with individual universities in the past, but that is not enough. We know that scientific research in many departments requires local materials. If these local materials are only collected by the Academy of Sciences itself, it will cost a lot of manpower, financial resources, and material resources, and it may not be able to obtain good results. However, if teachers from local universities collect them nearby, contact each other, and help each other, in this way, the Academy of Sciences can obtain research materials from various places, and teachers from various places can also get research convenience with the help of the Academy of Sciences, so as to improve themselves. In addition, we also hope that researchers from the Academy of Sciences should also take a few hours of classes in universities, and the Academy of Sciences can also set up more research laboratories and stations in the locations of various universities, and use professors from various universities to concurrently engage in research work. In this way, research work will not be divorced from reality, and research experience can be immediately passed on to students, which will of course improve the quality of teaching, that is to say, achieve the practical effect of research.

The above-mentioned points are very immature, and the specific methods still need to be studied in many ways. However, I think that university teachers should unleash the potential of scientific research, and teaching work should be improved on the basis of scientific research. This is the inevitable path. Otherwise, if we teach and teach, they are all old materials, how can we improve the quality of teaching? And how can we improve the national culture?

I am a scientific worker and also an educator, so I am only putting forward these superficial opinions on the situation of universities here. Please criticize and correct them, members and comrades.

    如何发挥高等学校教师在科学研究上应有的潜力
    董爽秋的发言
    我衷心拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话和周总理的报告，并完全同意李富春副总理关于第二个五年计划的说明和陈叔通副主席的报告。
    现在我想就“如何发挥高等学校教师在科学研究上应有的潜力”这个问题来表示我一点不成熟的意见。
    自从去年“向科学进军”的口号提出以后，各地知识分子都积极努力工作，以响应这个号召。可是同时也就表现出有两种不正常的思想情况。
    第一种人思想上看到政府重视科学研究工作，号召向科学进军，因而大、中学校的教员或机关干部，都想从事科学研究工作，不愿意教书或做其他工作。这样大家都不安心于岗位工作，而形成了专业思想不巩固的现象，尤其是师范学院的毕业生，不愿意当中学教员。他们的志愿第一想考研究生，进科学院为副博士头衔作准备；其次就想留在高等学校里当助教。至于当中学教师，他们认为是最没有前途的事情。为什么他们这样重视研究工作？因为研究论文发表了，既可得到荣誉，又可得到很多稿费，真是名利双收啊！而当中学教员，一生还是一个中学教员，最高的工资也不过百多元而已。
    另一种人思想上虽然也想做点研究，但因教学任务重，忙忙碌碌，零零碎碎，就把时间耗费了。他们没有很好地、有计划地安排自己的工作时间，既然没有时间去做研究，也就马马虎虎，得过且过，不想去做研究了。
    这两种思想，我认为都是不正确的。假使每一个人都只是坐在那里专门做研究工作，那么教书的工作又叫谁去担任呢？反过来，高等学校的教师若只是教教书，不去从事研究工作，教学的质量又将如何提高呢？我以为高等学校的教师，既要教书，也要做研究。拿研究的心得来充实教学的内容，这样才能提高教学的质量，这是高等学校的特征，也只有这样，才能叫作高等学校。所以高等学校的教师，从助教到教授，除了教学的工作以外，任何人都应该从事研究工作。如果我们不这样做，我们把科学研究的工作都推到科学院的少数人身上去，我们以六亿人口的国家，只靠科学院里的少数科学工作者来负起这个重担子，那是不够的。我们必须动员所有高等学校的教师们，积极发挥他们的潜力来从事科学研究工作，而后我们才有可能在十二年内赶上世界先进科学水平。
    当然高等学校的教师应该做研究工作，不论过去和现在，大家都这样想，这样讲，党和政府也是这样号召，可是实际上，高等学校的研究工作开展得很不够，也就是说还有很多潜力没有发挥出来。为什么呢？我认为下面这几点是值得我们注意的。
    一、减少教师的教学任务
    高等学校的教师必须教书，这是不成问题的。可是在此过渡时期，教书要自编讲义，一般教师大部分时间都耗费在编讲义上，而高教部和教育部规定编讲义的时间不特不算工作量，而且不算工作日。至于科学研究的时间，只能算工作日，也不能算工作量。因此教师们要教足所规定的工作量，就必须多担任课程，多与学生见面。这样就不可能再有很多时间来从事研究工作了。关于这个问题，教师们不免要发生疑问：为什么高等学校教师的研究工作不能算工作量呢？高等学校教师既已担负了繁重的教学工作，还能在教学之余，挤出一点时间来从事科学研究，这是值得赞许和鼓励的事情，为什么把他们这种辛勤劳动的时间不算作工作量呢？这就是说高等学校只有教学的时间才能算工作量，研究工作不能算工作量，那么科学院的研究人员将根据什么来算工作量呢？如果说这是苏联的先进经验，那我们也可不必一定要这样教条式地去学习它。因为在苏联的高等学校里教书，有教科书，有参考书，教师不要自编讲义，而且苏联教师水准高，备课不费很多时间，所以他们除了教学之外，还有多余时间来做研究工作。我们不能这样做。我们教书要编讲义，备课时间也要多些；我们的教师中能看俄文参考书的很少，而翻译本又常常语句不明，不知原意何在，自然要多费一些时间才能备好一堂课。因此我对这个问题的解决办法，希望以后招生人数不可太多，应与教师的力量相适应，又在高等学校里应多留助教，多多培养青年教师。教师多了，就可以适当地减少教师们的教学时间，也就可以多挤出一点时间来从事科学研究工作，并将研究的时间算作工作量。这样就大大地鼓舞了高等学校的科学研究工作。
    二、充实研究工作的设备
    今天各高等学校里科学研究的设备，一般说来，是很差的。当然教师们也应该在增产节约的原则下，为自己的科学研究工作创造条件，但是必需的、比较精密而不能自制的仪器，不能不作适当的补充。最重要的还有参考资料，是今天向科学进军中最难解决的一件事情。因为研究用的参考资料，常常需要有各国文字的旧杂志。这些资料有的已经绝版，不易购到。这里我想建议国家出版机关，可以有计划地、有步骤地把从国内外搜集来的、比较有价值的丛书、杂志影印多套，以便各高等学校分别购用（听说政府已有此计划，希望能早日实现）。
    三、保证一定的研究费用
    我们在研究工作上每用一个钱，当然也要贯彻增产节约的精神。但是必需的经费，还是不能节省。我们希望在高等学校里也规定有一项研究费用，能够保证所提出的研究计划不致因经费缺乏而不得完成。四、希望科学院能与各高等学校多多取得联系
    科学院过去与个别的高等学校也有些联系，那还不够得很。我们知道，很多部门的科学研究，需要有地方性的材料。这些有地方性的材料，如果只靠科学院自身派人去搜集，那就要耗费很大的人力、财力、物力，还不一定能获得很好的效果。但若由各地高等学校教师们去就近搜集，彼此联系，互相协助，这样，科学院既可从各地获得研究的材料，而各地教师也可因科学院的帮助，而得到研究的方便，以提高自己。此外我们还希望科学院的研究人员也要在高等学校里兼任几点钟课，而科学院还可在各高等学校所在地多设研究室、站，利用各地高等学校的教授来兼任研究工作。这样，研究工作不致脱离实际，而研究心得又马上可以传给学生，当然就会提高教学质量，亦就是说收到了研究的实效。
    上面所提出的这几点意见，是非常不成熟的，具体作法也还有待多方研究，不过我认为高等学校的教师应该发挥科学研究的潜力，而教学工作应在科学研究的基础上来提高它的质量，这是必然的道路。否则，教来教去，都是已有的旧材料，如何能提高教学质量？又如何能提高国家文化呢？
    我是一个科学工作者，也是一个教育工作者，所以我在这里仅就高等学校的情况提出这点粗浅意见，请委员们、同志们批评指正。
