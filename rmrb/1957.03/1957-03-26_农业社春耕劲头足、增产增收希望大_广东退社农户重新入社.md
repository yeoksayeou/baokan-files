Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 25th: Amidst the high tide of spring plowing, more than 65,000 households in over twenty counties including Fengkai, Xinyi, and Xuwen in Guangdong Province have rejoined agricultural cooperatives, and over 9,300 households who were considering withdrawal are no longer willing to leave. In the Zhanjiang Special District, more than 17,000 individual farming households have joined cooperatives, and 186 cooperatives that had previously disbanded have been re-established.

These households withdrew after the autumn harvest last year due to reduced income or temporary doubts about the cooperatives. According to statistics from early January this year, approximately 80,000 households in the province withdrew in the autumn, accounting for about 1% of the total number of households that had joined. Now, the majority of them, seeing the large scale of spring plowing and the large number of cadres going to the countryside to lead the cooperatives and production, feel that there is hope for increased income this year and are requesting to return to the cooperatives. Four households that had withdrawn from Xianbaidu Village in Huiyang County all automatically reviewed their actions when rejoining, saying, "Before, when we withdrew, we didn't see the future of the cooperative, our understanding was really poor."

When cadres were sent down to the countryside, the county committees and district secretaries of the Chinese Communist Party, who had better abilities, were especially sent to cooperatives with many households that had withdrawn or where production was not good. After arriving in the countryside, they mostly relied on poor and lower-middle peasant cooperative members to unite with middle peasant cooperative members to carry out spring plowing production, praising good deeds and good people who were determined to run the cooperatives well. At the same time, they also visited each withdrawing household to understand their opinions and correct their understanding of the cooperatives. Counties such as Yangjiang, Yangchun, and Xinyi also held special forums for withdrawing households, explaining the future of the countryside and using local, specific facts to conduct education on the two roads. In addition, all localities paid attention to reasonably resolving specific problems raised by some withdrawing households, especially the issue of mutual benefit between upper-middle peasants and the cooperatives. Therefore, they are willing to return to the cooperatives.

### 农业社春耕劲头足、增产增收希望大　广东退社农户重新入社

　　农业社春耕劲头足、增产增收希望大
　　广东退社农户重新入社
    新华社广州25日电　在春耕生产高潮中，广东省封开、信宜、徐闻等二十多个县已有六万五千多户退社户重新入社，并有九千三百多户闹退社的社员也不愿退了。湛江专区还有一万七千多户单干户入社；一百八十六个已经散伙的社也已重新建立起来。
    这些退社户是去年秋收后，由于减少收入或者对合作社的一时怀疑陆续退社的，据今年1月上旬统计，去秋全省约有八万户社员退社，占入社总农户的1％左右。现在他们之中的大多数户看到春耕生产规模大，大批干部下乡领导合作社和生产，感到今年增加收入有望，便要求再回到合作社来。惠阳县仙柏洞乡四户退社户回社时都自动检讨说：“以前退社，看不到社的前途，真是认识差。”
    各地下放干部时，也特别派中共县委委员、区委书记等能力较强的干部到退社户多、生产不好的合作社去。他们下乡后，大多是一面依靠贫农和下中农社员团结中农社员开展春耕生产，表扬坚决办社的好人好事，一面又逐户了解退社社员的意见，端正他们对合作社的认识。阳江、阳春、信宜等县对退社户还专门召开座谈会，讲解农村前途，用当地的具体事实进行两条道路的教育。此外，各地还注意合理地解决一些退社户提出的具体问题，特别是上中农和社的互利问题。因此，他们愿意回社。
