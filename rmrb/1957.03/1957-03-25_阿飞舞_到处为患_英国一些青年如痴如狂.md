Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: According to the Soviet "Komsomolskaya Pravda," in the leisure activities of some young people in Britain, wearing pajamas to dance the American "jitterbug" has become a common sight.

Not long ago, a correspondent from the West German magazine "Munich Illustrated" made a visit to the Soho district of London, known for its nightclubs. It used to be a place where some wealthy young men, who prided themselves on their serious demeanor, would often go for entertainment.

However, the reporter was refused entry because he was too well-dressed, as only men and women in pajamas were allowed to attend these parties. As a result, he had to go back and change into pajamas before returning.

The reporter entered the hall barefoot and was presented with a dizzying scene: to the deafening accompaniment of jazz music's howling sounds, semi-nude young men and women were convulsively dancing the newly popular American "jitterbug" in a state of mental stupor.

At that moment, a young man suddenly grabbed his female dance partner's legs, lifted her up, and then slammed her head on the floor a full twenty-one times. After slamming her head, he howled and reveled in the spectacle. According to the reporter's investigation, it turned out that this day was the girl's twenty-first birthday, and the scene just now was to celebrate her birthday.

　　“阿飞舞”到处为患
　　英国一些青年如痴如狂
    新华社23日讯　据苏联“共青团真理报”报道，在英国一些青年的业余生活中，穿着睡衣跳美国的“阿飞舞”已经是一种常见的情景。
    不久以前，西德杂志“慕尼黑画报”驻伦敦的记者到伦敦以夜总会出名的索霍区作了一次访问。那儿是曾经以严肃的风气自夸的一些阔少们经常消遣的地方。
    但是，这位记者由于穿得太整齐而被拒之于门外，因为只有穿睡衣的男女才能参加这些晚会的，结果他只得回去换了睡衣再去。
    这位记者光着脚进到大厅后，呈现在他面前的是一幅使人头昏眼花的景象：在震耳欲聋的爵士音乐嚎叫似的伴奏下，半裸体的青年男女一对对在神志昏迷的状态下抽搐地跳着新近流行的美国“阿飞舞”。 
    这时候突然有一个男青年抓住他的女舞伴的两条腿把她举起来，接着把她的头在地板上撞了整整二十一下，撞完又嚎叫狂欢下去。据记者查明，原来这一天正是这位姑娘的二十一岁生日，方才的场面，是用来庆祝她的生日的。
