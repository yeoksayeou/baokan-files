　　Peace of Mind Working at the Grassroots Level
　　Ying Lin
    Recently, various regions have successively transferred a large number of cadres from leading organs to lower-level organizations in rural and urban areas to assume various leadership and specific work positions. Many of these transferred comrades originally worked in grassroots organizations, were familiar with the situation of grassroots work, and had relatively rich experience in leading production and engaging in other specific work. Although some comrades have not worked in grassroots organizations in the past and temporarily lack experience in this area; however, because they have a certain level of policy and ideological understanding, especially the enthusiasm and desire to serve the people, as long as they are not afraid of difficulties, they will certainly be able to quickly become familiar with the work situation and learn the skills of working at the grassroots level.
    These comrades who have been transferred to work at the grassroots level can generally consciously obey the organization's assignments, happily embark on new work positions, and have already made significant achievements in their work. As soon as they arrive at the grassroots organizations, they immediately study, in close cooperation with local cadres, how to further improve work and how to better lead the masses to carry out production work and various business activities. And they influence and motivate the masses with their own exemplary actions. The vast majority of the more than 230 cadres sent to work in rural areas in Fengcheng County, Jiangxi Province, have carried forward the Party's fine tradition of close ties with the masses, eating, living, and working with the masses. Wang Xiaotian, a cadre from the People's Bank of the county, went to the fields on his first day in the countryside to learn how to level field ridges and plow fields from members of the agricultural cooperative, developing blisters on his hands. Through joint labor, he established a deep friendship with the farmers, mobilized them to collect the early rice stalks that had not been collected for several months, prepared for winter crop frost protection, and completed the plowing of more than 200 mu of land. Yao Jiangxi, who was assigned to serve as the Party branch secretary of Yongxin Township in Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province, started carrying river mud and cultivating fields with the masses as soon as he arrived in the township, establishing a high prestige among the masses and promoting the manure accumulation campaign throughout the township.
    However, there are also a few cadres who are unwilling to work at the grassroots level, preferring to work in leading organs; or only willing to work in cities, unwilling to work in rural areas. Therefore, when the organization transfers them, some people find all kinds of reasons to refuse the organization's assignments in a roundabout way; some people even make some unreasonable and absurd demands, and if the organization does not meet them, they refuse to go down. He Fude, a cadre from the Xinsheng Machinery Factory under the Labor Reform Bureau of the Public Security Department of Hunan Province, made three absurd demands when the organization transferred him to work in the countryside: admit that he is a formal member of the Chinese Communist Party, recommend him to study at a university next year, and find him a lover with a high school education. The organization has repeatedly educated him, but he still insists on his unreasonable personal demands, even expressing that if he does not achieve his goals, he will not hesitate to break away from the revolutionary ranks. In order to strictly enforce revolutionary discipline, the Public Security Department of Hunan Province had to decide to expel him. Although other comrades who are unwilling to work at the grassroots level have generally not caused such serious problems, they have obeyed the assignment after the organization patiently persuaded and educated them; however, because the ideological problems have not been well resolved, some people are still not at ease working at the grassroots level. Some people are physically in the countryside but their hearts are in the city, working sluggishly, even engaging in passive resistance. Some people are mentally distressed, retreat as soon as they encounter difficulties, have an extremely superficial work style, and wait for the organization to transfer their work.
    The reason why these comrades are unwilling to work at the grassroots level, apart from individual elements like He Fude with extremely base individualistic plans, is that more people do not understand the important significance of cadres being sent to lower levels. They believe that the organization's transfer of them from leading organs means that they are no longer trusted and have become redundant personnel, thus feeling very disgraced and unconsciously generating a sense of resistance. This idea is groundless. It should be explained that the reason why the Party and the state want to send cadres to lower levels is certainly, on the one hand, to eliminate the unreasonable phenomena of bloated leading organs, numerous levels, and overstaffing, but more importantly to enrich and strengthen the strength of grassroots organizations. As everyone knows, grassroots organizations are the most basic organizations for us to carry out work and connect with the masses. The Party and the state's policies and guidelines rely on them to be specifically implemented, and many of the people's opinions and demands must also be reflected to the leading organs through them. However, if the leadership and organizational strength of grassroots organizations are too weak, they will not be able to shoulder the tasks that they should. In this way, it will not only hinder the implementation of the Party and the state's policies and guidelines, causing losses to production and work; but also make it impossible to solve many problems in the production and life of the masses that should and could be solved, arousing the dissatisfaction of the masses and harming the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses. This shows that doing a good job in grassroots organizations is not only a necessary condition for doing all work well; but also an extremely important aspect of the Party and the government's close ties with the masses. However, in the past few years, due to the inappropriate expansion of leading organs in many places, a large number of experienced and capable cadres have been transferred to higher levels, thus on the one hand making the leading organs too bloated and large, with a large number of key personnel being accumulated and fostering bureaucracy; while on the other hand, grassroots organizations have not been strengthened and cannot adapt to the increasingly heavy needs of production and construction, financial and trade, and cultural and educational work. It is precisely in order to change this unreasonable phenomenon of being top-heavy that the Party and the government have decided to transfer a large number of cadres from leading organs and, according to the needs of the work and individual conditions, send many people to the countryside to assume the task of leading the masses to build a new socialist countryside; send many people to industrial and mining enterprises and transportation departments to strengthen the leadership of the country's socialist industrialization; and send many people to enrich the grassroots organizations of financial and trade and cultural and educational sectors in order to better carry out material purchase and sales work and cultural and educational work. Obviously, sending such a vital force to the front lines of our country, directly leading the masses to create wealth, and directly serving the country's construction and the people's lives, can it be said that the organization does not trust them? Can it be said that such work is not glorious? It should be said that this is precisely the greatest trust of the organization in them, and the burden on their shoulders is not lighter, but heavier.
    The scope of jurisdiction of grassroots organizations is too small, and working there is not as promising as working in leading organs. This is another argument of some comrades who are unwilling to work at the grassroots level. The error of this argument lies not only in underestimating the importance of grassroots work, but also in having an incorrect understanding of personal prospects. In fact, whether a person has prospects or the size of the prospects does not depend on where he works, let alone on the level of his job position, but on whether he has the desire to serve the people and how he serves the people. If he has the desire to serve the people and treats his work with an honest and active attitude, even if he works at the grassroots level, even if his job position is very low, he can still make very beneficial contributions to the people's cause, be trusted and valued by the organization, and be loved and supported by the masses, and his future is infinitely bright. However, some comrades do not understand personal prospects in this way. They believe that the higher a person's position, the greater his prospects; they feel that a cadre's position can only rise and cannot fall. It is under the domination of this kind of thinking that some people only want to go up and not down. Because going down, at most, can only be a branch secretary, a township head, or a director of a grassroots store. It must be pointed out that this understanding of personal prospects is wrong. It is a reflection of the old society's thinking of being an official in our revolutionary ranks. These comrades should quickly realize this, abandon this vulgar idea, and settle down to work in grassroots organizations.
    There are also some comrades, especially young comrades, who do not refuse to work at the grassroots level, but are unwilling to work in rural grassroots organizations or in grassroots organizations in small and medium-sized cities because they feel that life there is too hard. It should be repeatedly explained to these comrades that in recent years, due to the development of industrial and agricultural production, the lives of the people in urban and rural areas of our country have been considerably improved; but on the whole, the living standards of our people are still low, and compared with cities, life in the countryside is harder, and compared with large cities, life in small and medium-sized cities is harder. This is caused by historical conditions, and it will take a considerable amount of time and a lot of work to change this situation. Faced with such a reality, what should revolutionary cadres do? Is it to refuse to work in rural areas and small and medium-sized cities because they are afraid of hardship, and wait for others to create a happy and fulfilling life and enjoy the fruits of their labor? Or is it to throw themselves into the harsh environment, temporarily endure some difficulties in life and work, and work with the masses to change the reality with hard work? Needless to say, revolutionary cadres should take the latter path. Only by carrying forward the revolutionary tradition of hard work of our people can we change the poor and backward appearance of our country relatively quickly. On the contrary, if everyone is greedy for an easy and comfortable life and only knows how to pick the easiest and easiest things to do, how can the beautiful and happy life of socialism come about? And even if this beautiful and happy life comes about through the efforts of others, and we only know how to enjoy the fruits of their labor, is this not shameful? This is one aspect. Another more important aspect is that a person can only be able to fight against difficulties and only be brave enough to undertake the most difficult and arduous tasks, so that he can be more tempered and grow up quickly. It should be known that going to school to study is certainly an important method of accumulating knowledge, but it is not the main way for cadres to grow. The main way for cadres to grow is to put them in real struggles, especially in relatively difficult real struggles. Because cadres trained in this way have true knowledge and can stand the test, unlike flowers in a greenhouse, which wither when they encounter wind and cold. It can be believed that as long as these principles are clearly explained, the cadres who are sent to the grassroots will consciously obey the organization's assignments, and regard working in difficult places as a good opportunity for self-transformation, and thus work happily and contentedly at the grassroots level.

　　安心在基层工作
　　应麟
    最近一个时期，各地陆续从领导机关抽调了大批干部，把他们下放到农村和城市的基层组织，担任各种领导工作和具体工作。这些被抽调的同志，有很多原来就在基层组织工作，熟习基层工作的情况，有较丰富的领导生产和从事其他工作的具体经验。有些同志虽然过去没有在基层组织工作，暂时还缺乏这方面的工作经验；但是由于他们具有一定的政策思想水平，特别是具有为人民服务的热情和愿望，只要不怕困难，也一定能够迅速地熟习工作情况，学会在基层工作的本领。
    这些被抽调到基层工作的同志，一般都能够自觉地服从组织的分配，愉快地走上了新的工作岗位，并且已经在工作中作出了显著的成绩。他们一到基层组织，就在和当地干部的密切合作之下，立即研究如何进一步改进工作，如何更好地领导群众开展生产工作和各种业务活动。并且以自己的模范行动去影响和带动群众。江西省丰城县派到农村工作的两百三十多名干部，绝大多数都发扬了党的密切联系人民群众的优良作风，作到和群众同吃、同住和同劳动。该县人民银行的干部王笑天同志，到农村的第一天，就到田间向农业社社员学习铲田塍和犁田，一双手磨起了血泡。在共同劳动中，他和农民建立了深厚的友谊，发动农民收藏好了几个月尚未收藏好的早稻秆，作好了冬季作物的防冻工作，完成了二百多亩田的翻耕任务。被分配到浙江省兰溪县永新乡担任党总支书记的姚江西同志，一到乡里就和群众一起挑河泥、耕田，在群众中树立了很高的威信，推动了全乡的积肥运动。
    但是，也有少数干部不愿意到基层工作，只愿意在领导机关工作；或者只愿意在城市工作，不愿意到农村工作。因此当组织上调动他们的时候，有些人就找出各种各样的理由，转湾抹角地拒绝组织上的分配；有些人甚至提出了一些不合理的、荒谬的要求，如果组织上不予以满足，他们就不肯下去。湖南省公安厅劳改工作管理局所属新生机械厂的干部何福德，当组织上调他到乡村工作的时候，就提出了三个荒谬的要求：承认他是中共正式党员，明年保送他去大学读书，给他找一个有高中文化程度的爱人。组织上曾经多次地对他进行教育，而他仍然坚持个人的无理要求，甚至表示如果达不到目的，不惜脱离革命队伍。为了严肃革命的纪律，湖南省公安厅不得不决定将他开除。其他一些不愿到基层工作的同志，虽然一般地没有闹到这样严重的程度，在组织上耐心地进行说服教育以后，都服从了分配；但是由于思想问题没有很好地解决，有些人仍然不安心在基层工作。有的人是身在乡村而心在城市，工作疲疲沓沓，甚至消极怠工。有的人是思想苦闷，一遇到困难就往后退缩，工作作风极不深入，等待组织上调动他们的工作。
    这些同志所以不愿意到基层工作，除了像何福德那样个别品质恶劣的分子，抱着极端卑鄙的个人主义打算以外，更多的人是不了解干部下放的重要意义。他们认为组织上把自己从领导机关抽调出来，是不再相信自己了，自己成了编余人员了，因而觉得面子上很不光彩，不自觉地产生了一种抵触情绪。这种想法是毫无根据的。应当说明，党和国家所以要下放干部，这固然一方面是为了消除领导机关机构臃肿、层次繁多和人浮于事的不合理的现象，但更重要的是为了充实和加强基层组织的力量。大家知道，基层组织是我们进行工作和联系群众的最基本的组织，党和国家的方针政策要靠它们来具体执行，人民群众的意见和要求有很多也要通过它们来向领导机关反映。可是如果基层组织的领导力量和组织力量过于薄弱，它们就不可能担负起应当担负的任务。这样，就不仅会妨碍党和国家政策方针的贯彻执行，使生产和工作遭受损失；而且会使群众生产和生活中的许多应当而又可能解决的问题得不到解决，引起群众的不满，伤害群众的积极性和主动性。这就说明，做好基层组织的工作，不但是做好一切工作必不可少的条件；而且是党和政府密切联系群众的一个极为重要的方面。然而在过去的几年间，由于许多地方不适当地扩充领导机关，大批有经验有能力的干部层层上调，因而一方面使得领导机关过于臃肿庞大，大批骨干被积压起来，助长了官僚主义；而另一方面基层组织却得不到加强，不能适应日益繁重的生产建设、财经贸易和文化教育工作的需要。正是为了改变这种头重脚轻的不合理现象，党和政府才下决心把大批干部从领导机关抽调出来，根据工作的需要和个人的条件，把许多人派到农村去，担负领导群众建设社会主义新农村的任务；把许多人派到工矿企业和交通运输部门，加强对国家社会主义工业化的领导；把许多人派去充实财经贸易和文化教育的基层组织，以便更好地开展物资购销工作和文化教育工作。很显然，把这样一批有生力量派到我们国家的前哨阵地去，直接领导群众创造财富，直接为国家的建设和人民的生活服务，这能说是组织上不相信他们吗？能说是这样的工作不光荣吗？应当说，这正是组织上对他们的最大信任，他们肩头上的担子不是更轻了，而是更重了。
    基层组织管辖的范围太小，在那里工作不如在领导机关工作有前途，这是另一些不愿到基层工作的同志的论调。这种论调的错误，不仅在于低估了基层工作的重要性，而且对个人的前途有着不正确的理解。其实，一个人有无前途或前途的大小，不取决于他在什么地方工作，更不取决于他的工作职位的高低，而是要看他有无为人民服务的愿望和怎样为人民服务。如果他具有为人民服务的愿望，并且用诚实的积极的态度对待工作，即使他是在基层工作，即使他的工作职位很低，他同样能够为人民的事业作出非常有益的贡献，受到组织上的信任和器重，受到人民群众的爱戴和拥护，他的前途就是无限光明的。但是，有一些同志不是这样理解个人的前途，他们认为个人的职位愈高，前途就愈大；他们觉得干部的职位只能升，不能降。正是在这种思想的支配下，有些人就只愿意往上走，而不愿意往下去。因为到下面去，最多只能作个支部书记，作个乡长，或者作个基层商店的主任。必须指出，这种对于个人前途的理解是错误的，是旧社会的做官思想在我们革命队伍中的反映。这些同志应该赶快省悟到这一点，抛弃这种庸俗的想法，而安心在基层组织工作。
    还有一些同志特别是青年同志，并不拒绝到基层工作，但是不愿意到农村基层工作，不愿意到中小城市的基层工作，因为他们觉得那里的生活太艰苦了。应当反复地向这些同志说明，这几年来由于工农业生产的发展，我国城乡人民的生活已经有了相当的改善；但是整个说来，我国人民的生活水平还是低的，而比起城市来，乡村的生活要苦一些，比起大城市来，中小城市的生活要苦一些。这是历史的条件所造成的，要改变这种情况，还需要有相当的时间，还需要做许多工作。面对着这样的现实，作为革命的干部应当怎样办呢？是因为害怕艰苦就拒绝到农村和中小城市去工作，等待别人创造了幸福美满的生活而坐享现成呢？还是投身到艰苦的环境中去，暂时忍受一些生活和工作上的困难，和群众一起用辛勤的劳动去改变现实呢？不用说，革命干部应当走的是后一条道路。只有发扬我国人民艰苦奋斗的革命传统，才有可能比较迅速地改变我国贫穷落后的面貌。反之，如果人人都贪图安逸舒适的生活，只知道挑最轻便最容易的事情做，社会主义的美满幸福的生活又怎么能够来到呢？而且即使这种美满幸福的生活在别人的努力下来到了，我们只知道坐享其成，这难道不是可耻的么？这是一方面。另一方面更为重要的是，一个人也只有敢于同困难搏斗，只有勇于承担最困难最繁重的任务，他才能够受到更多的磨练，才能够迅速地成长起来。要知道，进学校读书，固然是积累知识的一个重要方法，但不是干部生长的主要途径。干部生长的主要途径，是把他们放在现实斗争中去，特别是放在比较艰苦的现实斗争中去。因为这样培养起来的干部，才具有真知，才经得起考验，而不像温室里的花，一遇风寒就枯萎了。可以相信，只要把这些道理讲清楚了，被派到基层去的干部才会自觉地服从组织上的分配，而且把到艰苦的地方工作当作自我改造的好机会，因而安心地、愉快地在基层工作。
