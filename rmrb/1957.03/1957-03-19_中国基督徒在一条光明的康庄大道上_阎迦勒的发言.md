    Chinese Christians on a Bright and Broad Road
    Yan Jiale's Speech
    I wholeheartedly and fully support Chairman Zhou Enlai's "Report on Visits to Eleven Asian and European Countries." I fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference."
    Before the opening of this meeting, at the enlarged meeting of the Supreme State Conference, we heard Chairman Mao's important instructions on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, which clarified the distinction between contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and contradictions among the people. I received a great education and great inspiration, which improved my ideological understanding and made me very happy.
    I am participating in this third plenary session of the CPPCC National Committee with extreme excitement. I am very pleased to see that our united front has been further expanded and consolidated, and our socialist construction is developing day by day.
    I would now like to talk to you about the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and the ideological transformation of Christians.
    I. The Superiority of the Socialist System
    First of all, I want to express my own understanding of the superiority of the socialist system and the profound impression I have gained:
    In the first half of 1956, I went to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region for inspection. If we compare today's Inner Mongolia with the old Suiyuan before liberation, although it is the same region, it has become two completely different worlds. The people of old Suiyuan were generally addicted to drugs, poor, had extremely poor sanitation, backward culture and education, practiced buying and selling marriages, abused women, and the various ethnic groups hated each other, even murdered each other, and the oppression of minority ethnic groups was even more common. The various sad and pitiful situations are truly beyond words.
    Old Suiyuan is my hometown, and I grew up in this environment, and I have suffered this pain since childhood. Today's Inner Mongolia is very different. Although I have only been away from it for a short eight years, everything I have witnessed this time I have rejoined it has surprised me endlessly.
    From the perspective of resource development, there is the Xing'an Forest in the east, the Baotou Iron and Steel in the west, extremely rich minerals, famous granaries, natural grasslands, and countless livestock, completely unlike the past where gold was everywhere but no one reached out to find it.
    From the perspective of social conditions, the people are well-fed and clothed, drug addiction has been eradicated, sanitation has improved a lot, and after joining the cooperative, men and women work diligently, production has increased sharply, literacy achievements are amazing, the establishment and increase of primary, secondary, and higher education institutions, culture and education are gradually improving, mutual love and mutual assistance, unity and friendship between ethnic groups, the construction of light and heavy industry, the development of farmland water conservancy, and the leap forward in transportation are all things I have never heard of before, and everywhere is new. Therefore, I have experienced that since the history of China, there has never been an era like today when the People's Government has done so much and so well for the people.
    Therefore, it not only gave me a very deep understanding of the superiority of the socialist system, but also made me realize even more that only the proletariat and the Communist Party can lead to such an unparalleled socialist system.
    II. The Ideological Transformation of Christians
    As a pastor, I feel it is necessary to give a brief report on the ideological transformation of Christians since the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. I believe that since the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the ideology of Christians has indeed undergone a major transformation. I, a Christian fundamentalist with extremely conservative ideas and deeply poisoned without realizing it, am a typical example.
    Regarding the ideological transformation of Christians, although it is still impossible to accurately calculate its quantity and number, according to its nature, it has indeed undergone a lot of transformation in ideology, which is certain. I would like to talk about it in the following items:
    1. In the past, many Christians had subjective prejudices, thinking that foreign missions spent money and effort to spread the Bible and the salvation of Christ to China, so they always thought that everything they did was good. They never thought that imperialism had used Christian missions as a tool for its aggression for nearly a century. It cleverly mixed pro-American, worship-American, anti-Soviet, and anti-communist ideas into the interpretation of the Bible. The role it played made Chinese Christians think ideologically that the British and American empires were Christianized countries, and their purpose was always to help China become rich and strong. In addition, it viciously spread the propaganda that the Communist Party is atheist and the great red dragon, and it will definitely not allow freedom of belief. These are all terrible poisons of imperialism, which have created a distance between Christians and the People's Government in their thinking, and gradually formed an opposition to the People's Government. With the development of this poisoned thought, they subjectively thought that they were loyal to God, but they did not know that the effect was beneficial to imperialism and detrimental to the interests of the motherland and the people.
    When the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries was launched vigorously, most Christians joined the movement to study and read the modern history of imperialist aggression against China in the past century. They saw that imperialism had used Christianity to commit crimes of aggression against the motherland, which was an indisputable historical fact. Only then did they suddenly realize that imperialism consciously promoted pro-Americanism and worship of America in order to create a lack of patriotism in Christians. In a semi-colonial situation, they enslaved the people of the motherland, and there was no chance to turn over. This poison was only clearly recognized and thoroughly criticized after learning until now. Therefore, recognizing the poison of imperialism is a major ideological transformation.
    2. Regarding religious policy, before participating in the study, many Christians were always skeptical about it. After studying, they realized that the religious policy of the People's Government is very clear. Through their own thinking, they realized that materialism is based on objective facts. The people need religion, and the People's Government protects religion. As long as someone believes, the People's Government now protects freedom of belief and will always protect freedom of belief. It definitely guarantees freedom of belief with the principle of mutual respect and non-interference, and fixes it with the constitution.
    Therefore, many Christians have realized that people with faith and the Communist Party can definitely cooperate. Because the basis of this cooperation is not based on whether there is a god or not, but on anti-imperialism, patriotism, building a socialist society, and seeking happiness for mankind. Therefore, recognizing the People's Government's policy of religious freedom is also a major ideological transformation.
    3. In the past, many Christians across the country were skeptical and unwilling to participate in the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of Christianity. In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, some counter-revolutionaries hidden in Christianity were exposed, clearing the obstacles on the road of unity for Chinese Christians. Therefore, many who did not participate in the study gradually participated in the study. Because of the study, they thoroughly knew that the organization of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement is anti-imperialist and patriotic, and has nothing to do with faith. The facts of the study have also proved that no Christian has been interfered with in their faith because of the study. As a result, Christians in various places have changed direction and shown a new look.
    Taking the Christian Great Assembly Place as an example, since the counter-revolutionaries hidden in the Christian Great Assembly Place were purged, most of the more than 700 local Christian Great Assembly Places across the country and more than 70,000 believers have removed the veil of concealment because of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and study, and have seen the loveliness of the motherland. Therefore, they aroused patriotic enthusiasm and actively participated in socialist construction. Taking the Great Assembly Places in Beijing and Shanghai as an example, according to the latest preliminary understanding, hundreds of Christians have won the glorious titles of model and advanced workers.
    In 1956, in response to the movement to raise donations for winter clothes and relief for disaster victims, the believers of the Christian Great Assembly Places in Beijing and Shanghai donated more than 1,400 pieces of various clothes. The reason why the believers of the Christian Great Assembly Places across the country have changed so much is inseparable from the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the study of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement. We have realized that the Chinese Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement is a bright and splendid road that Christians must take in this new era. Therefore, participating in the Three-Self Patriotic Movement is also a major ideological transformation.
    Summarizing the above overview of the ideological transformation of Christians is my responsibility, so I am reporting it here separately, so that the government leaders, all the members, and the people of the country can understand the situation of the ideological transformation of Christians here.
    Finally, I would like to express here that I will, under the leadership of the Party and the government, lead the believers to unite in the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, actively participate in socialist construction, and strive to defend world peace.

    中国基督徒在一条光明的康庄大道上
    阎迦勒的发言
    我衷心完全拥护周恩来主席所作“关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告”。我完全同意陈叔通副主席所作的 “中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告”。
    这次会议开幕以前，最高国务会议举行的扩大会议上，听到了毛主席关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾问题的重要指示，明确了敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部矛盾的区别，叫我受到了很大的教育，得到了很大的启发，提高了我思想的认识，使我感到非常高兴。
    我以极兴奋的心情参加这次政协全国委员会第三次全体会议，我很愉快的看到，我们的统一战线更加扩大和巩固了，我们的社会主义建设事业日益向前发展了。
    我就着社会主义制度无比的优越性，和基督徒思想的改造这两个问题，现在同各位谈谈。
    一、社会主义制度的优越性
    首先，我要把我自己对社会主义制度的优越性所有的认识，和所得到一个极深刻的印象说出来：
    1956年上半年我到内蒙古自治区视察，若以现在的内蒙古和解放前的旧绥远对比一下，虽然同是一个地区，但已成为迥然不同的两个世界了。旧绥远的人民普遍吸毒，贫穷，卫生情况极坏，文化教育落后，买卖婚姻，摧残妇女，各民族间彼此仇视，甚至相互凶杀，欺压少数民族更为习见的事。种种悲痛可怜的情形，真是一言难尽。
    旧绥远是我的故乡，我是在这种环境里长大的，自幼就饱尝这种痛苦。今天的内蒙古就大不然了，我和它相别虽仅短短的八年，这次和它重行相会，凡所目睹无一不叫我惊奇不止。
    从资源的开发来说，东有兴安森林，西有包头钢铁，矿产极富，谷仓闻名，天然草原，牲畜难数，完全不像从前遍地是黄金、无人伸手寻了。
    从社会情况来说，人民丰衣足食，吸毒根绝，卫生情况进步尤多，而且加入合作社后，男女殷勤劳动，生产骤增，扫盲成绩惊人，中小以及高等学校的设立、增加，文化教育日渐提高，各民族间互爱互助、团结友好，轻重工业的建设，农田水利的发展，交通运输的跃进，都是我前所未闻，无处不新的。因此，我体验到中国自有史以来，从没有一个时代像今天人民政府为人民做了这样又多又好的事情。
    从而不但叫我对社会主义制度的优越性有了极深刻的认识，同时也更叫我体会到只有无产阶级的共产党来领导，才会有这样优越无比的社会主义制度。
    二、基督徒的思想改造
    我作为一个教牧人员，觉得有必要把肃反以来基督徒的思想改造情况作一扼要的汇报。我认为肃反以来，基督徒的思想的确得到了大的改造，像我这个基督教基要派思想极其保守，中毒极深而不自觉的人，就是一个典型的例子。
    关于基督徒思想改造的情况，虽然现在还不能准确的计算出它的量和数，但按照性质来说，在思想上的确得到了很多的改造，这是肯定的。以下我愿分项来说一说：
    1、过去许多基督徒有主观成见，认为外国差会费财费力把圣经和基督的救恩传到中国来，所以总认为他们的一切都是好的，没想到帝国主义近百年来，就已经利用了基督教的差会，作了它侵略活动的工具，它巧妙地把亲美崇美、反苏反共的思想，掺杂在圣经的解释里面，它所起的作用，叫中国基督徒在思想上都认为英美帝国是基督化的国家，目的总是帮助中国富强起来。另外，它又恶毒的宣传共产党是无神的，是大红龙，必定不能叫信仰自由。这些都是帝国主义厉害的毒素，使基督徒在思想上和人民政府有了距离，渐渐的形成了与人民政府的对立。这样中毒思想的发展，自己很主观的以为向神忠心，那知得出来的效果，是有利于帝国主义，有损于祖国和人民的利益。
    等到肃反运动轰轰烈烈的展开，多数的基督徒投入了运动学习当中，读到了近百年来帝国主义侵略中国的近代史，看见帝国主义曾利用基督教有过侵略祖国的罪行，是一个无可置辩的历史事实，这才恍然大悟，才认识到帝国主义有意识的宣传亲美崇美是为了给基督徒造成了没有爱国的思想。在半殖民地的情况下，奴役祖国人民，永无翻身的机会。这个毒素直到现在经过学习，才清楚的有了认识，才彻底的有了批判。所以说认识帝国主义毒素，是一个大的思想改造。
    2、对于宗教政策来说，在没有参加学习以前，许多基督徒对它认识总是半信半疑的，经过学习以后，才知道人民政府的宗教政策是非常明确的。通过自己的思想，认识到了唯物主义是根据客观的事实，人民需要宗教，人民政府就保护宗教，只要有人信仰，人民政府现在保护信仰自由，永远保护信仰自由。肯定的用彼此尊重、互不干涉的原则，保证信仰自由，并用宪法固定起来。
    因此，许多基督徒已认识到了有信仰的人和共产党绝对是能合作的。因这合作的基础并不是建立在有神无神的上面，乃是建立在反帝爱国、建设社会主义社会、为人类谋幸福上面。所以认识到了人民政府的宗教信仰自由政策，也是一个大的思想改造。
    3、过去全国各地有许多基督徒对于基督教三自爱国运动怀疑不肯参加。在肃反运动中，一些暗藏在基督教的反革命分子被揭发了，清除了中国基督徒在团结道路上的障碍，因此许多不参加学习的，逐渐参加了学习，因着学习，才彻底的知道了三自爱国运动的组织，是反帝爱国，与信仰无关。经过学习事实也证明了，没有一个基督徒因着学习遭到了信仰的干涉。因而各地的基督徒转了方向，出现了新的面貌。
    仅就基督徒巨会处来说，自从将隐藏在基督徒巨会处的反革命分子肃清以后，全国七百多个地方基督徒巨会处，七万多信徒，绝大多数因着肃反学习，揭去了蒙蔽的帕子，看见了祖国的可爱，因而挑起了爱国的热情，积极的参加了社会主义的建设。就北京和上海的巨会处而言，按最近初步的了解，已有百数十位基督徒获得了模范和先进工作者等等光荣的称号。
    1956年响应了募捐寒衣、救济灾民的运动，北京和上海基督徒巨会处的信徒，就捐献了一千四百余件各种的衣服。全国基督徒巨会处的信徒之所以如此变化，是与肃反和三自爱国运动学习分不开的。我们已认识到中国基督教三自爱国运动，是这新时代中基督徒必走的一条光明灿烂的康庄大道。所以说参加三自爱国运动，也是一个大的思想改造。
    总结以上基督徒思想改造概况，是我的负担，所以在这里分别报告出来，好让政府首长、各位委员、和全国人民在此明了基督徒思想改造的情况。
    最后，我在这里表示：我要在党和政府的领导下，带领信徒团结在三自爱国运动里面，积极的参加社会主义建设，为保卫世界和平而努力。
