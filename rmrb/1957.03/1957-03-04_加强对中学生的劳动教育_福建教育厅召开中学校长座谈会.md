Strengthening Labor Education for Middle School Students
Fujian Education Department Holds Symposium with Middle School Principals

(Reported by this newspaper) The Fujian Provincial Department of Education convened a symposium of some middle school principals from February 19th to 23rd, focusing on how to strengthen political and ideological education in schools. The meeting specifically analyzed the current ideological situation of students, believing that socialist ideology is still dominant among students. However, due to the weakness of ideological education in schools and the influence of non-proletarian ideas on students, some new problems have arisen in students' thinking. Therefore, strengthening political and ideological education is now the primary task. The content of political and ideological education, in addition to continuing to strengthen internationalism and patriotism education, collectivism, and conscious discipline education, must especially strengthen labor education, strengthen current affairs and policy education, promote the superiority of the socialist system, especially the superiority of agricultural collectivization, and conduct revolutionary tradition education for students.

The meeting required all schools to educate students on some new ideological problems that have arisen, guiding them to learn to use class viewpoints to analyze the domestic and international situation, distinguish between right and wrong, and clarify the relationship between the individual and the collective, the relationship between democracy and centralism, and the relationship between freedom and discipline. Improve students' ideological awareness and the consciousness and enthusiasm for learning.

The meeting pointed out that last year, schools had once relaxed labor education for students (especially graduates). In the future, all schools must formulate plans to conduct career and labor education for students, especially graduating students, through various activities inside and outside the classroom. Improving the political and ideological level and class consciousness of teachers is an important part of strengthening political and ideological education. The meeting required all schools to strengthen the leadership of teachers in studying Marxism-Leninism and current affairs policies; and further mobilize teachers' enthusiasm and improve their spirit of overall responsibility. In terms of school leadership, it is also necessary to strengthen the leadership of homeroom teachers and the work of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers. In addition, the meeting believed that teaching work is the regular central work of the school and still needs to be continuously strengthened, and teachers and students should have certain requirements; the health of students must also continue to be improved, physical exercise should be strengthened, raising pigs and growing vegetables should be promoted, the quality of meals should be improved, and attention should be paid to cultivating hygiene habits.

    加强对中学生的劳动教育
    福建教育厅召开中学校长座谈会
    本报讯  福建省教育厅于2月19日至23日召开了部分中学校长座谈会，着重研究了如何加强学校政治思想教育问题。会上具体分析了当前学生的思想情况，认为社会主义思想在学生中还是主要的。但是由于学校思想教育薄弱和非无产阶级思想对学生的影响，使学生思想上产生了一些新的问题。因此，加强政治思想教育，已是当前的首要任务。政治思想教育的内容，除继续加强国际主义和爱国主义教育、集体主义和自觉纪律教育外，必须特别加强劳动教育，加强时事政策教育，宣传社会主义制度的优越性，特别是农业合作化的优越性，对学生进行革命传统教育等。
    会议要求各校针对学生产生的一些新的思想问题进行教育，引导他们学习运用阶级观点来分析国内外的形势，分清是非界限，明确个人与集体的关系、民主与集中的关系、自由与纪律的关系。提高学生思想认识水平和学习的自觉性与积极性。
    会议指出去年各学校曾一度放松了对学生（特别是毕业生）进行劳动教育，今后各校必须订出计划，通过课内和课外的各种活动，对学生尤其是毕业班的学生，进行前途教育和劳动教育。提高教师的政治思想水平和阶级觉悟，是加强政治思想教育的重要环节。会议要求各校加强对教师学习马克思列宁主义和时事政策的领导；并进一步调动教师的积极性和提高其全面负责的精神。在学校领导方面，还要加强对班主任和团、队工作的领导。此外，会议认为教学工作是学校经常的中心工作，仍需继续加强领导，对教师和学生应有一定的要求；对于学生健康状况也必须继续改善，加强体育锻炼，提倡养猪种菜，改善伙食质量，注意培养卫生习惯等。
