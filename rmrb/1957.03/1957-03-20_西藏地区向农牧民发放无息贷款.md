Xinhua News Agency report: The Tibet Branch of the People's Bank of China has begun issuing interest-free loans to farmers and herdsmen. Agricultural loan teams at the Jiji Qus办事处 (Office) and Zong办事处 (Office) in Qamdo, Tagong, Yadong and other places have recently gone deep into agricultural and pastoral areas to carry out the distribution work. In Lhasa, Shigatse and other areas where the farming season is later, the agricultural loan teams are preparing and studying ethnic policies.
This year, the interest-free loans obtained by farmers and herdsmen in the Tibet region will be about double that of last year, and the scope of loans will also be expanded. This year's interest-free agricultural loans are mainly for seeds, and in some areas, a portion of loans for draught animals, farm tools, and small-scale water conservancy projects will be issued with emphasis; farmers and herdsmen who suffered disasters last year will also be given appropriate food rations to settle their production. The Tibet Water Conservancy Team will send personnel to help farmers who have obtained loans solve technical difficulties in water conservancy construction.

    西藏地区向农牧民发放无息贷款
    新华社讯　中国人民银行西藏分行开始向农牧民发放无息贷款。昌都、塔工、亚东等地的机巧级办事处和宗办事处的农贷组，最近已先后深入农牧区进行发放工作。拉萨和日喀则等农时较晚的地区，农贷组正在做准备工作和学习民族政策。
    今年西藏地区农牧民得到的无息贷款比去年增加一倍左右，贷款面也将扩大。今年无息农业贷款以贷放种籽为主，在有些地区，并有重点地发放一部分耕畜、农具和兴修小型水利的贷款；对去年遭受灾害的农牧民，还要适当发放给口粮，安置他们生产。西藏水利队将派出人员帮助得到贷款的农民解决兴修水利中技术上存在的困难。
