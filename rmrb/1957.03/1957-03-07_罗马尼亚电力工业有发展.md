Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest: According to the Romanian News Agency, Romania can now produce the same amount of electricity in three months as it did in the entire year of 1938. Its electricity production in 1956 increased threefold compared to 1938.

Currently, Romania has more than twenty hydroelectric and thermal power stations. Some cities whose power equipment was previously unconnected are now linked by a unified power grid. This not only guarantees the electricity needed for industry, but also ensures the increasing electricity consumption of residents.

    罗马尼亚电力工业有发展
    据新华社布加勒斯特电　据罗马尼亚通讯社报道：目前，罗马尼亚只要三个月就能生产出1938年全年所生产的电力。它的1956年的发电量比1938年增加了三倍。
    现在，罗马尼亚共有二十多个水力和火力发电站。过去供电设备相互没有联系的一些城市现在已经由统一的电力网联结起来。这样不仅保证了工业所需要的电力，同时也保证了居民愈来愈多的用电量。
