Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 10th: "Al-Ahram" published an editorial on March 9th, demanding that the United Nations Emergency Force hand over the areas recently evacuated by Israeli troops to Egypt.

The newspaper said that the United Nations has no right to unilaterally change the mission of the United Nations Emergency Force. The establishment of the United Nations Emergency Force, its duties, and its entry into Egypt are governed by an agreement between Egypt and the United Nations. No provision of this agreement can be modified without the consent of both parties, otherwise it would constitute an "act of force." It said that such actions would create unrest and chaos in the Middle East, and the United Nations would be blamed for acting as a tool of the great powers.

"Al-Gomhuria" sharply criticized certain Westerners for attempting to deny Egypt the right to demand that the United Nations Emergency Force withdraw from Egyptian territory after completing its mission. The newspaper wrote that the suggestion of the United Nations Emergency Force "remaining indefinitely" on Egyptian territory is an imperialist conspiracy and a violation of Egyptian sovereignty.

Sadat, the editor-in-chief of "Al-Gomhuria," published an article in the newspaper saying that the withdrawal of Israeli troops marks the end of one round in Egypt's struggle against imperialism.

He said that it is necessary to further heighten vigilance, because the imperialist aims of aggression have not changed, and because it failed in the first round, it is even more determined to launch conspiracies against Egypt today.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 10th: The commander of the United Nations Emergency Force, Burns, moved his headquarters to Gaza today. The headquarters were originally located in Bala in the Suez Canal area.

    埃报抨击西方阴谋割裂埃及领土
    要求交还以军撤出的地方
    新华社开罗10日电　“金字塔报”3月9日发表社论，要求联合国紧急部队把以色列军队最近撤出的地方交还给埃及。
    这家报纸说，联合国无权片面改变联合国紧急部队的任务。联合国紧急部队的成立，它的职责和它的进入埃及，是由埃及和联合国的协议规定的。非经双方同意，不能修改这个协议的任何条款，否则这就构成“强力行动”。它说，这样的行动会在中东造成不安和混乱，而联合国也会由于充当大国的工具而受到责备。
    “埃及报”在社论中尖锐地抨击某些西方人士企图否认埃及有权要求联合国紧急部队在完成任务以后撤出埃及领土。这家报纸写道，关于联合国紧急部队“无限期地留驻”在埃及领土上的建议是一种帝国主义阴谋和对埃及主权的侵犯。
    “共和国报”主编萨达特在这家报纸上发表文章说，以色列军队的撤退是埃及反对帝国主义斗争中许多回合中的一个回合的结束。
    他说，需要进一步提高警惕，因为帝国主义的侵略目的还没有改变，而且由于它在第一个回合中失败了，所以今天它也就更加决心要发动反对埃及的阴谋。
    新华社开罗10日电　联合国紧急部队司令伯恩斯在今天把他的司令部迁移到加沙。司令部原来设在苏伊士运河区的巴拉。
