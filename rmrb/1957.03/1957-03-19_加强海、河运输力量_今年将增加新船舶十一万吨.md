Strengthening Sea and River Transportation
110,000 Tons of New Ships to be Added This Year
According to Xinhua News Agency, this year, China's state-owned sea and river transport enterprises will add 108 new ships, totaling more than 110,000 tons. This is the year with the largest increase in ship tonnage since the First Five-Year Plan.

The new ships planned for this year include freighters, passenger-cargo ships, oil tankers, tugboats, and barges.

The new ships for maritime transport are mostly sturdily built vessels that are urgently needed in our country to transport ore, coal, and bulk cargo. The machines used on the ships are the most advanced dual-compound dual-expansion waste heat turbine coal-fired steam engines. This type of machine is suitable for the current fuel situation in our country and is more economical, with fuel consumption 20%-30% lower than that of ordinary coal-fired ships. The ships are also equipped with modern electronic navigation aids such as radar, electronic direction finders, and depth sounders, which greatly contribute to ensuring navigation safety. The speed of the ships is also relatively fast.

Among the ships added to inland rivers, a batch of 500-horsepower tugboats used on the Yangtze River were designed by Chinese technicians using new technologies from the global shipbuilding industry. The main engine of this tugboat is a modified steam engine, and the hull's lines are also well-designed, with low resistance. It is also equipped with a flow guide, resulting in higher efficiency. It is expected to be able to tow about 1,000 tons more cargo than our current old-fashioned tugboats of the same horsepower. Among the more than 20 barges newly added to the Yangtze River this year, four are specially designed barges for transporting pigs. Each barge can transport 1,800 pigs, and the barges are equipped with ventilation and temperature control devices.

In the past four years, China has added more than 311,000 tons of new ships. It is expected that by the end of this year, China will overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan's target of adding 400,000 tons of ships by 2%.

### 加强海、河运输力量  今年将增加新船舶十一万吨

    加强海、河运输力量
    今年将增加新船舶十一万吨
    据新华社讯　今年我国国营海运和河运企业将增加一百零八艘、总共十一万多吨的新船舶。这是第一个五年计划以来增加船舶吨位最多的一年。
    今年计划新增的船舶，有货轮、客货轮、油轮、拖轮和驳船。
    海上新增的船舶大部分是我国目前迫切需要的运输矿石、煤炭和大宗货物用的结构比较牢固的船只。船上采用的机器是蒸汽机中最先进的双联双涨带废汽透平式的燃煤蒸汽机。这种机器适合我国目前燃料的情况，而且比较经济，燃料的消耗比一般燃煤船舶低20％——30％。船上并且装有现代化的电子助航设备如雷达、电子测向和测深仪等，这对保证航行安全有很大作用。船的速度也是比较快的。
    内河增加的船舶中，有一批用在长江的五百马力的拖轮是我国技术人员采用了世界造船工业的新技术设计出来的。这种拖轮的主机是改良式的蒸汽机，船的线型也设计得比较好，阻力小，并且设有导流管，因而效率比较高。它比我国目前同样马力的老式拖轮预计可以多拖一千吨左右的货物。今年在长江新增的二十多艘驳船中，有四艘是特别设计的专门运猪用的驳船。每艘驳船可以运猪一千八百头，船上并且设有通风和调节温度的装置。
    在过去四年中，我国已经增加了三十一万一千多吨的新船舶。预计到今年年底，我国第一个五年计划规定的新增四十万吨的船舶将超额2％完成。
