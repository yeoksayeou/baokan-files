At this conference, the atmosphere is filled with even more joy and excitement than at the previous two. Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference pointed out the truth in handling contradictions among the people; Premier Zhou's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries strengthened the confidence in consolidating the unity of the socialist camp. These are the main factors that make everyone very excited. The group discussions and plenary speeches are becoming more and more enthusiastic, further realizing the hope of continuing to promote the democratic tradition. In particular, the issue of birth control has received special attention at the conference, which makes me even more excited.

The correct interpretation of birth control is planned childbearing. Modern people can have plans in all aspects of life, study, and work, and they must also have plans in childbearing. If childbearing is unplanned, with children born too early, too quickly, too closely, and too many, it will not only tire and suffer the parents, but also make it difficult to raise and educate the children well, and disrupt the entire family. It will inevitably disrupt the plans for life, study, and work, and indirectly affect the country's economic construction plans and other plans. In the past, it was impossible to make childbearing plans. With scientific contraception methods, it is easy to develop plans. Everyone can decide when to have children and how many children to have in advance, according to their own conditions and wishes, and follow the plan, and can also modify the plan at any time. The benefits of planned childbearing are obvious. The contraception exhibition currently being held in Zhongshan Park in Beijing has a set of pictures entitled "Planning Ahead", which shows the benefits of planned childbearing and is very educational. At present, promoting birth control is easily accepted by the masses, but we have not done enough and need to vigorously promote it. Contraceptive drugs are also urgently needed by the masses, but we cannot provide them universally and in a timely manner, and need to manufacture them in large quantities and import some. The masses also demand more convenient, more economical, and more effective oral contraceptives, but we cannot provide them, and need medical experts to actively research them. These are all arduous and complex tasks, but I believe that under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, with the joint efforts of relevant departments, they can all be done well. At present, there are still some issues on which views are not completely consistent, and we should conduct full and frank discussions. I would like to present my views below and ask comrades for their corrections.

Do not agree to restrict induced abortion by law or power

I. Correctly view the issue of induced abortion. In my speech at the First Session of the First National People's Congress, I quoted Lenin's words, originally linking the abolition of laws punishing abortion with the dissemination of contraception theories, but then I said: "In our country, the issue of abortion can be put aside." I really lacked courage at the time. But three months later, in an article I published in Guangming Daily, there was already a section on "Additional Discussion on the Issue of Induced Abortion." The development of objective circumstances is enough to make our thinking progress. The Ministry of Health initially restricted induced abortion very strictly, but later gradually relaxed the regulations. In her speech at this conference, Committee Member Li Dequan said: "The implementation of induced abortion and sterilization surgery should mainly depend on personal voluntariness in the future, and some restrictions should be abolished." I fully support such measures. At the same time, Committee Member Li Jiansheng's speech adopted another view, which probably represents the views of some doctors in Beijing. Unfortunately, this view is one-sided. It seems correct to say that induced abortion wastes national resources, causes hospital beds to be crowded, and makes doctors busy, but it does not take into account that if all these people who have induced abortions were hospitalized for childbirth, the national resources would be spent even more, the hospitals would be crowded for even longer, and the doctors' busyness would not be reduced at all. Of course, it would be best if these people could practice contraception early and not request induced abortion. The problem is that these people are already pregnant, and if they are not given induced abortion, they will use more dangerous methods to induce abortion privately. Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 28: "Many female workers, after becoming pregnant, take quinine, drink 'sha yao shui', drink spirits, recklessly jump on trams, and carry heavy objects." These female workers all wanted to have induced abortions but could not. Therefore, I dare not agree with Committee Member Li Jiansheng's assertion: "Induced abortion should not be justified solely on the grounds of hindering work and study, but should be decided based on physical health conditions, and generally should still follow the guidance of doctors." This is to retighten the regulations that the Ministry of Health has already relaxed, and even disregard the difficulties in work and study, and everything depends on the doctors; this is even more the one-sided opinion of the doctors. "Hindering work and study" is a fact that everyone can see, and cannot be said to be an excuse. The so-called "physical health conditions" were limited in the past to women suffering from certain serious diseases who were allowed to apply for induced abortion, which was entirely based on the view that "the more people the better," and that healthy people should have more children; if it is based on the view that induced abortion is dangerous, then it is completely unreasonable. People with serious diseases are not afraid of the danger of induced abortion, so why are healthy people without diseases afraid of danger instead? Currently, doctors are unwilling to perform many induced abortions, they are very tired, and they cannot cope with the workload. It is understandable that they hope that the leaders of various agencies will approve fewer applications; but if they think of the infinite pain of those who apply for induced abortion and are rejected, and even more of the serious harm of private abortion, the doctors will surely be able to perform induced abortion with the spirit of selfless labor; at the same time, the Ministry of Health and health institutions at all levels should cultivate more doctors who can competently perform induced abortion surgery. Today, people can see clearly that "too many people is also not good," and there is no need to stick to the old views.

It must be stated: I do not deny that induced abortion has harmful effects. I also agree that while vigorously promoting birth control and contraception, we should also vigorously promote the harm of induced abortion. I just do not agree with prohibiting or restricting induced abortion by law or power. Let us look at the situation in the Soviet Union! Soviet Minister of Health Kovrigina, in her report at the "International Discussion on Equal Rights of Soviet Women" held in Moscow in September last year, talked about the issue of abortion. She started from the Soviet government's decree in 1920 on providing free induced abortion in hospitals, and talked about the suspension of this decree in 1936, and its replacement with a decree punishing abortion. From 1938, the number of private abortions began to increase again, often leading to serious gynecological diseases and infertility. By the time they reached medical institutions, they had already started bleeding, and not all of them could be saved. In order to protect women's health and lives, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union issued a decree in 1955 abolishing the prohibition of abortion. Statistical materials prove that the mortality rate of abortions performed in medical institutions is now equal to zero. She concluded by saying: "Permitting abortion does not mean encouraging abortion. Abortion performed in medical institutions is not without impact on women's health. The Soviet Ministry of Health recommends that health authorities in various regions strengthen health education, explain the harm of abortion to women widely, and at the same time ensure that there is a complete possibility to use contraception methods." She also said: "Unfortunately, there are currently no supplies that can guarantee women's contraception. Many scientific research institutes are looking for more effective contraceptives." To check the original text, please refer to the "Soviet Women" magazine, December 1956 supplement, page 30.) This is the most correct understanding and handling method for the issue of induced abortion, and it is worth learning from. (Committee Member Kang Tongbi also cited the example of the Soviet Union, but unfortunately she did not notice the Soviet Union's decree in 1955 abolishing the prohibition of abortion, otherwise she might not advocate prohibiting induced abortion by law either.)

Suggest launching a campaign to amend Article 4 of the Marriage Law, soliciting public opinions, and conducting publicity to promote late marriage

II. Appropriately amend Article 4 of the Marriage Law. Promoting birth control inevitably requires promoting late marriage. More and more people are recognizing the harm of early marriage. Postponing marriage a little can not only reduce some births, but also benefit study, work, and life. But should we amend Article 4 of the Marriage Law and raise the legal age for marriage for men and women when promoting late marriage? There are still different opinions on this. Many people believe that promoting late marriage should only be done through publicity and education, and there is no need to amend the Marriage Law. The Marriage Law stipulates that "men must be 20 years old and women must be 18 years old before they can marry," which takes into account social customs and reasonable requirements, especially for the vast rural areas. Modifying it now and raising the marriage age may lead to the majority of people violating the law, which is not easy to handle. This is based on very serious consideration and is very reasonable. Another opinion believes that the Marriage Law has been promulgated and implemented for almost seven years, and there has been great progress in all aspects in these seven years. Modifying the marriage age stipulated in the Marriage Law will not cause problems. At the same time, promoting late marriage must be done by amending the Marriage Law in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Relying solely on publicity and education is not enough. In last year's meeting, I personally suggested soliciting the opinions of all committee members on whether to raise the marriage age stipulated in the Marriage Law to 23 for men and 20 for women. The result of the solicitation was that the majority of people agreed. At this meeting, there were a total of six proposals suggesting raising the marriage age for men and women and amending the Marriage Law. In group discussions, almost every group talked about the issue of birth control, and many people also agreed to amend the Marriage Law. The review opinions of the Proposal Review Committee on the six proposals were all "suggesting that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress review and handle them." After receiving the suggestions from this meeting, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress will definitely handle them seriously. Whether to submit a proposal to amend Article 4 of the Marriage Law at the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress? And how should the marriage age for men and women be modified to be appropriate? (The six proposals have different views on the marriage age for men and women) There will definitely be a proper decision. After this meeting, if we launch a campaign to amend Article 4 of the Marriage Law, starting from the local committees of the CPPCC at all levels, and widely solicit public opinions, even if we do not amend the Marriage Law temporarily, it will greatly help the publicity and education work of promoting late marriage.

Vigorously promote birth control in rural areas; do not restrict permanent contraception surgery

In addition, I would also like to talk about three points. First, the idea that rural areas cannot talk about birth control is long gone. Rural women also deeply feel the pain of having too many children too quickly, and the demand for contraception is very urgent. This can be seen in inspections in rural areas, and the reflections from other aspects are also the same. We should no longer say that birth control work should first focus on cities and that rural areas can be a little slower. At present, rural areas are organized, and publicity work is not too difficult to do. Supply and marketing cooperatives can be responsible for supplying medicines. I especially agree with what Committee Member Hou Debang said in his speech that "birth control is of greater significance to rural areas." We should overcome all difficulties, vigorously promote birth control work in cities, and also vigorously promote birth control work in rural areas. Second, it is correct that we should not carry out birth control work in minority areas with sparse populations, and I also agree with it; but the benefits of planned childbearing are mainly that it can adjust the density of having children. Giving birth to the same number of children, but not too closely, is of great benefit to the health of the mother and also of great benefit to the education of children. I hope that the committee members and comrades attending the conference from minority nationalities will also study the knowledge and methods related to family planning. Birth control and contraception should be carried out under the condition of respecting each person's willingness, and absolutely no compulsory means can be used to force anyone to adopt contraception methods. There is no need to have any concerns in this regard. Third, regarding permanent contraception surgery, the person in charge of the Ministry of Health stated to Xinhua News Agency reporters on the 2nd of this month: "Ligation of the fallopian tubes and vas deferens are safe and reliable permanent contraception methods that will not affect sexual function and physical health," which can of course eliminate various incorrect claims and concerns. Some doctors have said that this type of surgery is also dangerous and should be restricted because they are too busy with ligation of the fallopian tubes, and complained that "the approval is too broad and excessive." Now, promoting ligation of the vas deferens more can reduce the difficulties of doctors, "because this type of surgery is simple." I very much agree with the joint speech of the nineteen committee members, which made a detailed and correct explanation of permanent contraception surgery, and solemnly said: "It should be carefully considered by both husband and wife," which is the most comprehensive, reasonable, and appropriate statement. In short, I believe that it is inappropriate to take restrictions on permanent contraception surgery.

Comrades, my speech is to learn from the committee members who made a joint speech, "starting from the spirit of protecting women and children, better educating future generations, for the benefit of national health and prosperity, and for the benefit of socialist construction." But I lack specialized medical knowledge. If there are any errors, please correct and criticize them.

    有计划地生育孩子
    邵力子谈关于节制生育的几个争论问题
    这次大会，比上两次大会更充满欢欣鼓舞的气氛。毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话，指示了处理人民内部矛盾问题的真理；周总理关于访问亚欧十一国的报告，加强了巩固社会主义阵营团结的信心；这是使大家非常兴奋的主要因素。分组讨论和大会发言越来越热烈，更实现了继续发扬民主传统的希望。尤其是节制生育问题得到大会的特殊注意，我更感到兴奋。
    节制生育的正确解释，是有计划地生育孩子。现代的人，在生活、学习、工作各方面都可以有计划，在生育方面也必须有计划。如果生育没有计划，孩子生得过早，过快，过密，过多，自己受累受苦，孩子又养不好，教不好，整个家庭也弄不好，就必然把生活、学习、工作的计划全都破坏，间接也会影响国家的经济建设计划和其他计划。生育计划在从前是没法拟订的，有了科学的避孕方法便很容易制订，每个人都可以按照自己的条件和愿望，想在什么时候生孩子，想有几个孩子，预先定出计划，按计划办事，还可以随时修改计划。有计划地生育的好处显而易见，正在北京中山公园举办的避孕展览会，有一组题为“早有打算”的图片，显示有计划地生育的好处，最富有教育的效果。目前宣传节育已很容易为群众所接受，而我们做得还不够，有待于大力开展；避孕药物更是群众所迫切需要，而我们不能普遍地及时供应，有待于大量制造并进口一部分；群众还要求更简便更经济更有效的内服避孕药物，而我们还不能提供，有待于医药专家积极研究。这些都是艰巨复杂的工作，但我相信在党和政府的正确领导下，由有关部门共同努力，都一定可以做好。目前还有一些问题，看法未能完全一致，应当充分而坦率地进行讨论，下面提出我的意见，请求同志们指正。
    不赞成以法令或权力限制人工流产
    一、正确地看待人工流产问题。我在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上发言，引用列宁的话，原以废弃惩罚堕胎法律与传播有关避孕理论并提，而我接着却说：“在我国，堕胎问题可以撇开不谈”，我当时实在缺少勇气。但三个月以后，我在光明日报刊出的一篇文章里，已有一段 “附谈人工流产问题”，客观情势的发展，足使我们思想进步。中央卫生部最初限制人工流产很严，以后逐渐放宽规定，这次大会发言，李德全委员说：“对人工流产及绝育手术的施行，今后当主要取决于个人自愿，废除一些限制”；我完全拥护这样的措施。与此同时，李健生委员的发言，采取另一种看法，大概是代表北京市一些医师的意见，可惜这种意见是片面的。说人工流产浪费国家财力，造成医院病床拥挤和大夫忙乱，看去很对；却没有想到这些做人工流产的人如果都住院生产，国家财力要耗费更多，医院拥挤的时间要更长，大夫忙乱也不会稍减。当然，这些人如果早能避孕，不要求人工流产，是最好不过的；问题是这些人已经怀了孕，不给她们做人工流产，她们会用更危险的方法私自堕胎。新华社上海2月28日讯：“不少的女工怀孕以后，吃奎宁，喝痧药水，喝烧酒，乱轧电车，搬重物”，这些女工都是想做人工流产而不得的。所以我不敢苟同李健生委员的主张：“做人工流产不能单以妨害工作和学习为借口，而要以身体健康的条件作决定，一般仍应遵照医师的指导”。这是要把中央卫生部已经放宽的规定重新抽紧，甚至不管工作和学习上的困难，一切取决于医师；这更是医师们片面的意见。“妨害工作和学习”，是人人看得见的事实，不能说是借口。所谓“身体健康的条件”，过去是限于患有若干严重病症的妇女始得申请人工流产，这完全基于“人越多越好”的观点，要身体健康的人多生孩子；倘基于人工流产有危险的观点来看，那就十分不通，有严重病症的人不怕做人工流产的危险，为什么身体健康无病的人反而怕出危险呢？目前医师们不愿多做人工流产，他们很辛苦，工作忙不过来，希望各机关领导上少批准一些，是可以谅解的；但如果想到申请人工流产而被拒绝的人将有无限痛苦，更想到私自堕胎的严重危害，医师们便一定能以忘我劳动的精神做人工流产；同时，中央卫生部和各级卫生机构应当多多培养能胜任人工流产手术的医师。今天人们已能看清“人太多也不好”，不必再执持过去的成见了。
    必须说明：我并不否认人工流产有害处，我更同意在大力宣传节育避孕的同时也大力宣传人工流产的害处，我只是不赞成以法令或权力禁止或限制人工流产。让我们看看苏联的样子吧！苏联卫生部长科夫里根娜，在去年9月莫斯科举行的“苏联妇女平等权利国际讨论会”上作报告，谈到堕胎问题。她从苏联政府在1920年颁布在医院中免费进行人工流产的法令讲起，说到1936年停止此项法令有效，而代以惩罚堕胎的法令，从1938年起私自堕胎的数目又开始增加，常常导致严重的妇科病和不孕症，到医疗机关时已开始流血，且不能全都救活，为了保护妇女的健康和生命，苏联最高苏维埃主席团在1955年又颁布了取消禁止堕胎的法令，统计材料证明：在医疗机关施行堕胎，死亡率已等于零。她最后说：“许可堕胎并不意味鼓励堕胎，在医疗机关施行堕胎对妇女的健康也不是毫无影响的，苏联卫生部建议各地保健机关加强卫生教育，向妇女广泛地解释堕胎的害处，同时保证有完全的可能来使用避孕方法。”她又说：“可惜目前还没有足以保证妇女避孕的用品，许多科学研究所正在寻找更有效的避孕用品。”要查对原文，请看“苏联妇女”杂志1956年12月份副刊第三十页）这是对人工流产问题最正确的认识和处理方法，值得我们学习。（康同璧委员也举了苏联的例子，可惜她未注意到1955年苏联取消禁止堕胎的法令，否则她或者也不主张用法律禁止人工流产。）
    建议开展修改婚姻法第四条的运动，征求群众意见，进行提倡迟婚的宣传
    二、适当地修改婚姻法第四条。提倡节制生育，必然要提倡晚婚。目前已有越来越多的人认识早结婚的害处，推迟一点结婚，不只可以减少一些生育，对于学习、工作、生活都有好处。但是提倡晚婚，是否要修改婚姻法第四条，提高男女结婚的法定年龄呢？这还存在着不同的意见。不少的人认为提倡晚婚只应从宣传教育方面着手，不必修改婚姻法，婚姻法规定“男二十岁，女十八岁，始得结婚”，是兼顾社会习惯和合理要求的，特别是照顾广大农村；目前加以修改，提高婚龄，或将导致多数人触犯法律，不好处理；这出于很郑重的考虑，很有理由。另一种意见认为婚姻法公布施行已将满七年，这七年中各方面都有极大进步，修改婚姻法规定的结婚年龄不会引起毛病；同时，提倡晚婚，必须修改婚姻法，始能收事半功倍的效果，单靠宣传教育是不够的。我个人在去年会议，曾建议征询全体委员意见，应否提高婚姻法规定的男女结婚年龄为男二十三岁女二十岁，征询结果，得到大多数人的赞同；这次会议，共有六个提案，建议提高男女结婚年龄，修改婚姻法；在分组讨论中，几乎每个小组都谈到节制生育问题，赞同修改婚姻法的人也很多。提案审查委员会对于六个提案的审查意见，都是“建议全国人民代表大会常务委员会审核办理”。全国人民代表大会常务委员会得到本会议建议以后，必将郑重处理，是否即在第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议提出修改婚姻法第四条的建议？以及男女结婚年龄究应如何修改始为适当？（六个提案对于男女结婚年龄的主张不同）必将有妥善的决定。这次会议以后，我们如果展开一个修改婚姻法第四条的运动，先从政协各级地方委员会做起，广泛地征求群众意见，即使暂时不修改婚姻法，也会对于提倡晚婚的宣传教育工作有很大帮助。
    大力向农村推行节育工作；不要对持久性避孕手术进行限制
    此外，我还谈三点意见。一、农村谈不到节育的想法早已过去了，农村妇女也深感过多过快生育孩子的痛苦，要求避孕很迫切，这是视察农村中都能看到的，其他各方面的反映也都相同；我们不要再说节育工作应先着重城市，农村可以稍慢一些。目前农村已是有组织的，宣传工作并不太难做，供应药品则供销合作社可以担任。我特别同意侯德榜委员发言中所说“节育对农村有更大意义”的话。我们应当克服一切困难，大力向城市推行节育工作，也以大力向农村推行节育工作。二、少数民族地区人口稀少，不进行节育工作，是对的，我也同意；但是有计划地生育的好处，主要地是可以调整生育孩子的密度，同是生几个孩子，生得不太密，对母体健康有很大好处，对子女教养也有很大好处；我希望少数民族出席大会的委员们，列席同志们，也对于有关计划生育的知识和方法进行研究。节育避孕本应在尊重各人自愿的条件下进行，绝对不能用强迫命令的手段，强制任何人采用避孕方法，在这方面是不必有什么顾虑的。三、关于持久性的避孕手术，卫生部负责人本月2日对新华社记者发表谈话，曾说：“结扎输卵管和输精管是安全可靠的持久性避孕方法，不会影响性机能和身体健康”，当然可以消除各种错误的说法和顾虑。有些医师曾因结扎输卵管手术过忙，而说这种手术也有危险，应加限制，并抱怨“批准太宽太滥”，现在多提倡结扎输精管，便可以减少医师们的困难，“因为这种手术简便”。我很赞同十九位委员的联合发言，对持久性避孕手术，作了详尽而正确的说明，又郑重地说： “应该由夫妇双方慎重考虑”，这是最全面的合情合理的说法。总之，对持久性避孕手术采取限制，我认为是不适当的。
    各位同志：我的发言是向十九位联合发言的委员学习，“从保护妇女儿童，更好的教养后代，以利民族健康繁荣，有利社会主义建设的精神出发”。但我缺少医学专门知识，有什么错误之处，请求指正和批评。
