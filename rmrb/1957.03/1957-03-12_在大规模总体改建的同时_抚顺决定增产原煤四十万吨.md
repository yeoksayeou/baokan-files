Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 11th - The coal capital, Fushun, will increase its raw coal production by 400,000 tons for the country this year. This decision was made after thorough discussion at the recently concluded expanded meeting of the Fushun Mining Area Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

    This plan to increase raw coal production was formulated after in-depth assessment. Fushun Coal Mine will undergo large-scale overall reconstruction this year, and the tasks of non-productive stripping and tunneling are greater than in any previous year. Additionally, the coal from more than 20 coal mining faces will be exhausted, and new faces need to be developed, which will relatively reduce raw coal production. At the beginning of the year, when compiling production plans, various mines overemphasized these objective production difficulties and did not actively mobilize the masses to tap the potential for increased production. The Party Committee promptly discovered and criticized these erroneous ideas and arranged for increased production and conservation work. In order to tap the potential for increased production, various mines universally organized assessment teams to conduct in-depth investigations in various workshops. The Director of the Fushun Mining Bureau and the heads of various business departments also conducted in-depth assessments in various mines.

    During the assessment process, various mines resolved many key production issues, providing conditions for increased production.

    Currently, all mines under the Fushun Mining Bureau are deeply mobilizing the masses to discuss the national plan, further tap potential, and strive to increase raw coal production even more.

    在大规模总体改建的同时
    抚顺决定增产原煤四十万吨
    新华社抚顺11日电　煤都抚顺今年要给国家增产四十万吨原煤。这是在最近结束的中共抚顺矿区党委扩大会议上经过充分讨论以后决定的。
    这个增产原煤的计划是经过深入摸底以后订出来的。抚顺煤矿今年要进行大规模的总体改建，非生产性的剥离和掘进任务比过去任何一年都大，还有二十多个采煤掌子的煤将要采完，要开拓新的掌子面，这样就相对降低了原煤产量。年初各矿在编制生产计划的时候，过分强调了这些生产上的客观困难，不积极发动群众挖掘增产潜力。党委及时发现和批判了这些错误思想，布置了增产节约工作。各矿为了挖掘增产潜力，普遍组织了摸底小组深入各车间进行摸底。抚顺矿务局局长和各业务部门的负责人也分别深入到各矿进行了摸底。
    在摸底过程中各矿都解决了许多生产上的关键问题，给增产提供了条件。
    目前抚顺矿务局所属各矿，正深入发动群众讨论国家计划，进一步挖掘潜力，争取更多增产原煤。
