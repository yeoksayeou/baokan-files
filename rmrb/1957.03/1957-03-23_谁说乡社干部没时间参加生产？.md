Who Says Township and Commune Cadres Have No Time to Participate in Production?
　　Lin Yu
    Some township cadres and agricultural cooperative cadres say: the workload is heavy, and there is no time to participate in production labor.
    Can township and commune cadres really find time to participate in production? According to my understanding at the three-level cadre meeting in Longxi County, Fujian, as long as some meetings and affairs can be reduced and time can be arranged reasonably, it is entirely possible for township and commune cadres to participate in production.
    At the enlarged three-level cadre meeting in Longxi County, the following problems were identified in the leadership of county-level agencies: 1. The county has too many phone calls that the districts and townships cannot answer; 2. There are too many documents that they cannot read; 3. There are too many forms that they cannot compile statistics for; 4. There are too many meetings that they cannot attend; 5. There are too many tasks that they cannot complete; 6. There are too many problems that they cannot solve. According to investigations and understanding in several townships, the main cadres of townships and communes spend at least fifty to eighty days a year attending meetings in counties and districts. Reading official documents (and of course, processing them) and compiling statistical forms also take up a large part of their time. If the county can hold fewer unnecessary meetings and issue fewer documents and statistical forms, it can increase the labor time for township and commune cadres a lot. In addition, county and district cadres working in rural areas want township and commune cadres to accompany them whether there is anything to do or not; they convene cadres for meetings without considering whether it is really necessary, and they talk endlessly, which also takes up a lot of labor time for township and commune cadres. The number of meetings in townships and communes is truly astonishing! The masses have compiled the following two lines of doggerel to describe this phenomenon: "Big meetings on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th (referring to big meetings every ten days on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th), small meetings every day."
    If these problems can be solved, township and commune cadres will have a lot of time to participate in production. If township and commune cadres can reasonably arrange their work and production time and carry out their work in a planned way, they can both do their work well and have time to participate in production.
    During the enlarged three-level cadre meeting in Longxi County, I visited the township and commune cadres of Yuanxi Township in Chengguan District. In the conversation, the accountant of the Anxin Agricultural Production Cooperative (an advanced cooperative, all 125 households in the township participated in this cooperative) opened his notebook and told me the following figures: the party and Communist Youth League branch secretaries, the three township heads and deputy heads, the township secretary, the women's federation director, the forest ranger (semi-detached from production), the credit cooperative director and accountant, the agricultural cooperative director and accountant, and other twelve key cadres, from November 1955 to November 1956, for thirteen months, participated in the cooperative's labor and earned a total of more than 24,000 work points, an average of more than 2,000 work points per person (every ten points is equivalent to one workday). In terms of individuals, the one who scored the most points was the Communist Youth League branch secretary, 307 workdays; the township secretary earned 50 workdays; the women's federation director earned 90 workdays; the agricultural cooperative accountant earned 103 workdays; the rest of the cadres earned more than 200 workdays. The party branch secretary, who is responsible for the main work of the whole township, earned 285 workdays in production labor; although the township head went to the Jianyang Cooperative Training Class for four months, he still earned 183 workdays; the cooperative director, who is already fifty years old, also earned 252 workdays. These twelve key cadres, together with the labor income of their family auxiliary labor force, received a total income of more than 4,400 yuan at the end of the year, an average income of 370 yuan per household, and an average income of more than 90 yuan per person, which is a significant increase compared to last year. This is just their income from participating in production labor; if we calculate the work points and wages subsidized to them by the agricultural cooperative and the state, the income will be even greater.
    People may doubt: Can they do a good job in their leadership work if they spend so much time engaged in labor production? Let me tell you, their work is not only done well, but it is also done very beautifully. Taking grain production as an example, last year's production increased by 31% compared to 1955, and the state's unified purchase task was overfulfilled; in forestry production, the afforestation task was overfulfilled. The total income of agriculture, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and forest and local specialties of the entire cooperative in 1956 increased by 43% compared to 1955. Among the 125 households of cooperative members in the entire township, 34 households increased their income by one-fold compared to 1955, 75 households increased their income by 20%-30%, and only 2 households had a slight decrease in income. The cooperative is well consolidated. Therefore, Yuanxi Township won the title of Model Township for Agricultural Production Increase in Longxi County in 1956.
    How did the cadres of this township manage to complete their work tasks and find so much time to participate in production and improve their lives? They told me the following facts: This township has consistently adhered to the principle of not holding meetings during the day and holding meetings at night; holding small meetings more often in villages, production teams, and groups, and holding fewer mass meetings; and not holding unprepared meetings. In the past year, this township only held one meeting during the day, which was the election of township people's representatives, because the villages were scattered and it was inconvenient to hold it at night, so it was held during the day.
    Over the past year, the township party branch has resolutely implemented the practice of holding a branch meeting every ten days to summarize, review, and discuss the work of the ten days; and holding a study and organizational life meeting every twenty days to carry out criticism and self-criticism. In this way, the ideological unity and unity of action of the branch leadership were guaranteed, and various tasks were successfully completed. Even such few and important meetings are scheduled to be held at night. There are many departments in a township, and the branch has strengthened its leadership over the work of these departments. Under the unified leadership of the branch, the cadres of each department have clearly divided their work and established a responsibility system, so that "everyone has something to do and everything is managed by someone."
    This style of the township branch is deeply welcomed by the cooperative members. All party members and township and commune cadres have extremely high prestige among the masses. They have a deep understanding of the work experience of this year. They said: In the past, when we were cadres, we used our mouths to call a lot, and we had no practical actions ourselves. We wore shoes and did not go to the fields. As a result, the more we called, the more the masses hated us, and the less energetic the production became. The masses criticized us as "crows crowing, someone dies." Last year, we changed our leadership style. Except for going to meetings in counties and districts or being sick, we went to the fields with the cooperative members to work during the day, and we sat down with the cooperative members in the group to discuss work, thoughts, and other issues at night. Sometimes, when the cooperative members had heated arguments over some issues, they could be solved smoothly as long as we explained the truth to them. They said that there are too many benefits to working and producing with the cooperative members. When the cooperative members see that we are active, they are even more energetic; and we can understand and solve their ideological problems in a timely manner; at the same time, we can give the captains and group leaders a lot of concrete help so that they can do their work better.

　　谁说乡社干部没时间参加生产？
　　林瑜
    有些乡干部和农业社干部说：工作任务繁重，没有时间参加生产劳动。
    乡社干部究竟能不能抽出时间参加生产？根据我在福建龙溪县三级干部会议上的了解，只要能够减少一些会议和事务，合理安排时间，乡社干部参加生产是完全可能的。
    在龙溪县三级扩大干部会议上，检查出了目前县级机关领导上存在着这样几个问题：一、县上电话多，区乡接不了；二、文件多，看不了；三、表格多，统计不了；四、会议多，来不了；五、任务多，完成不了；六、问题多，解决不了。根据几个乡的调查了解，一年中，乡社的主要干部到县区里开会的时间最少也有五十到八十天。看公文（当然还得处理）和统计表格，也占了他们很大的一部分时间。如果县里能少开一些不必要的会议，少发一些文件和统计表格，就能给乡社干部增加很多劳动时间。此外，在乡村工作的县区干部，不论有事没事，都要乡社干部陪着他们；不看是不是确实需要，就召集干部开会，讲起话来没个完，这也占了乡社干部许多的劳动时间。乡社里的会议之多，真是惊人！群众把这种现象编了二句打油诗：“大会三六九（指每旬三、六、九日都有大会），小会天天有。”
    这些问题能够解决，乡社干部就会有很多的时间参加生产。乡社干部如果能合理安排自己的工作和生产时间，做到工作有计划地进行，就能既把工作做得很好，也有时间参加生产。
    我在龙溪县三级扩大干部会议期间访问了城关区园溪乡的乡社干部。在谈话中，安心农业生产合作社（高级社，全乡一百二十五户都参加了这个社）会计员打开笔记本，告诉我下面几个数字：党团支部书记、三个正副乡长、乡秘书、妇联主任、护林员（半脱产）、信用社主任和会计员、农业社主任和会计等十二个主要干部，自1955年11月开始到1956年11月止，十三个月时间参加社里劳动共得工分二万四千多分，每人平均得到二千多分（每十分为一个劳动日）。以人来说，得分最多的是团支部书记，三百零七个劳动日；乡秘书得五十个劳动日；妇联主任得九十个劳动日；农业社会计员得一百零三个劳动日；其余的干部都得了二百个劳动日以上。担负全乡工作主要责任的党支部书记，在生产劳动中得二百八十五个劳动日；乡长虽到建阳合作训练班学习了四个月，但仍得劳动日一百八十三个；社主任年已五十岁了，也得到劳动日二百五十二个。这十二个主要干部，连同家庭辅助劳力的劳动所得，年终分配的时候总共收入四千四百多元，每户平均收入三百七十元，每人平均收入九十元多，比去年大大增加了收入。这只是他们参加生产劳动的收入；如果把农业社和国家补助他们的工分和工资计算进去，收入就更多。
    人们可能要怀疑：他们用这样多的时间从事劳动生产，领导工作能够做好吗？告诉大家，他们的工作不仅做好了，而且做得非常漂亮。就拿粮食生产来说，去年比1955年增产了三成一，超额完成了国家统购任务；林业生产，超额完成了造林任务。全社1956年农业、畜牧业、副业及林副土特产的总收入比1955年增加了43％。全乡一百二十五户社员中，有三十四户收入比1955年增加了一倍，有七十五户社员收入增加20％—30％，只有二户社员收入略有减少。合作社巩固得很好。因此，园溪乡荣获龙溪县1956年甲等农业增产模范乡的称号。
    这个乡的干部，究竟是怎样既完成了工作任务，又能争取那样多的时间参加生产、改善生活的呢？他们告诉我这样一些事实：这个乡一年来始终是坚持了白天不开会，晚上开会；多下村和生产队、组召开小会，少开群众大会；不开无准备的会。这个乡在去年一年中，在白天只召开过一次会议，那是选举乡人民代表，因为村分散不便晚上召开，才在白天召开的。
    这个乡的党支部，一年来坚决执行了十天召开一次支部会，总结检查和讨论十天工作；二十天召开一次学习和过组织生活会，开展批评和自我批评。这样，保证了支部领导的思想统一和行动统一，顺利完成了各项工作。支部连这样少而又重要的会议也安排在晚上开。在一个乡里有许多部门，支部加强了对这些部门工作的领导，各部门干部在支部的统一领导下，明确地分了工，建立了责任制度，做到“人人有事干，事事有人管”。
    这个乡支部的这种作风，深受社员群众的欢迎。全体党员、乡社干部在群众中有极高的威信。他们对于这一年的工作经验有深刻的体会。他们说：从前我们当干部的，都是用嘴叫的多，自己没有实际行动，脚穿鞋子不下田，结果是越叫群众越讨厌，生产越搞越没力，群众批评我们是“乌鸦叫，别人死。”去年我们改变了领导作风，除了到县区里开会或者生病以外，白天都和社员一起下田生产，晚上就在组里和社员一起座谈工作、思想等各种问题。有时候社员对一些问题展开了激烈的争吵，只要向他们讲清道理，就很顺利地解决了。他们说，同社员们一块劳动生产的好处太多了。社员们看见我们积极，他们也更加起劲；而且可以及时了解和解决他们的思想问题；同时可以给队长、组长很多具体帮助，使他们能更好地进行工作。
