　　All-China Youth Federation National Committee Holds Expanded Meeting
　　Discusses Strengthening Ideological Education for Youth
    Xinhua News Agency, March 28th -- The Second National Committee of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation held its Fourth Plenary Expanded Meeting in Beijing from the 22nd to the 27th.

    This meeting focused on discussing how to improve and strengthen the work of the All-China Youth Federation in the future, how to strengthen ideological education for youth from all walks of life, and how to arrange and educate this year's middle and primary school graduates who cannot continue their studies.

    Over the past year, the work of local All-China Youth Federations has become more active, and the number of All-China Youth Federation organizations has increased from thirty-four to one hundred and eighty-two. The meeting believes that, based on the current situation, local All-China Youth Federations should pay special attention to the work of extensively connecting with young people, consider the reasonable demands of young people from all walks of life, and earnestly help them solve some specific problems; at the same time, they should carry out various beneficial activities in accordance with the different characteristics and requirements of young people from all walks of life. In routine work, attention should be paid to fully promoting democracy.

    The meeting believes that local All-China Youth Federations should also strengthen the work of conducting ideological education for young people from all walks of life, focusing on explaining to young people the principles of building the country through diligence and thrift, hard work and plain living, and correctly handling the relationship between individuals and the collective, helping them establish a worldview of serving the people, and mobilizing them to respond to the call of the Party and the state to increase production and practice economy with practical actions. When conducting education for young people, correct opinions reflected by young people should be adopted or promptly reported to relevant parties; incorrect opinions should be patiently explained.

    Regarding how to organize this year's primary and secondary school graduates who cannot continue their studies to conduct self-study and arrange their future, the meeting requested local All-China Youth Federations to cooperate with relevant parties and make early ideological mobilization work based on the principle of strengthening education and making appropriate arrangements, and to summarize past experience and actively open up avenues for them to study and find employment.

    The meeting decided that the Third National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation, originally scheduled to be held in the first half of this year, will be held in the second half of this year.

    During the meeting, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, and Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, spoke at the meeting, and Qu Tangliang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, gave a work report.
