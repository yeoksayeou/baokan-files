Cultivate a Social Ethos of Diligence and Thrift, and Combat Extravagance and Waste
Speech by Du Zhonghe

I fully endorse the twelve instructions given by Chairman Mao at the Supreme State Conference. The eighth item he raised – increase production and practice economy, oppose extravagance and waste – is also a matter of pressing importance. Some people may think, "Here we go again, haven't we already rectified this? Now we're rectifying it again?" Yes, we are not forgetful. We carried out the Three-Anti Campaign and a frugality campaign in the past, but the problems haven't been eradicated. Since the disease has relapsed, the good medicine can certainly be used again.

Do Not Forget Your Roots

Increasing production is a positive thing, and the broad masses of Chinese laborers are working hard at it. Practicing economy is also a positive thing, and I would like to focus on this issue. A style of hard work and simplicity is the fine tradition of the Chinese people. "If you can chew on vegetable roots, you can accomplish anything." Wearing clothes made of coarse cloth was once a prevailing fashion. The thatched cottage of Du Fu is a beautiful story passed down through history. Of course, we do not hope to restore or permanently maintain the past living standards of the Chinese people. What we urgently hope for is the gradual improvement of living standards. However, in recent years, the social atmosphere in some areas has gradually become extravagant, which is not commensurate with our economic construction. We know that our construction has just begun, our economy is still facing difficulties, and some of our regions are still experiencing varying degrees of disaster. If an individual's living standards are raised too high and become too conspicuous, it is inevitable that they will become detached from the masses. If we intentionally or unintentionally become heroes who "spend public funds generously," then we should be morally condemned. Regrettably, this unhealthy trend has manifested itself in some cadres, especially in higher-ranking cadres (both Party members and non-Party members). I once saw a cartoon: a bureau chief is pacing in front of his office door, and his child is waving to him from the apartment upstairs, which is only a short distance away, "Dad, come home for dinner!" "Wait a minute, the car hasn't arrived yet!" This is satire, but it is well-intentioned satire. A certain organ in a certain place built a magnificent kindergarten. It is said that this type of architecture would not be inferior even if it were moved to the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, they forgot that they were living in China. Individual medium-sized cities are vigorously building theaters and cinemas with large roofs, using the excuse that it is convenient to receive international friends. As Vice Premier Chen Yun pointed out: In 1956, certain tendencies of pursuing luxury and excessively high standards resurfaced. Commander-in-Chief Zhu De criticized the competition among individual cadres to pursue extravagance as "forgetting their roots" and said that this style would undermine the worker-peasant alliance. These are truly earnest words! The Party and the government have repeatedly called for "building the country with diligence and thrift" and "doing everything with diligence and thrift," but individual cadres are behaving in this way, which is an intolerable offense!

Learn from the Soviet Union's Spirit of Thrift

Seeing some of the current undesirable tendencies, it naturally makes me think of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has been established for forty years and is now transitioning to a communist society, but the Chita railway station in Siberia is still a building from the Tsarist era. Some middle school buildings in Moscow are still partially old buildings from forty years ago. The medical equipment used in hospitals includes products from 1956, as well as old models from the Tsarist era. They have been practicing anti-waste and practicing thrift for decades. Lenin talked about it more than once, and Stalin also talked about it more than once. For the Soviet Union, thrift has long become a positive factor in building a socialist society. I remember Khrushchev once said: We do not imitate Parisian fashions simply because our cotton-padded coats damage our beautiful curves. He also instructed cadres who were assigned cars to practice driving themselves in order to save manpower for the country. Our construction is learning from the Soviet Union, and the spirit of thrift should also be no exception.

Promote the Fine Tradition of Hard Work and Simplicity

As I said earlier, the Chinese people have always had a style of hard work and simplicity, and this fine tradition was inherited by the Chinese Communist Party long ago. I heard that when Chairman Mao was in Yan'an, he often asked the relevant personnel, "Does my supply exceed the regulations?" The solemn attitude of the people's leader towards public property can vividly and concretely educate tens of thousands of cadres.

It should be acknowledged that the quality of a person's character can be reflected in their attitude towards public property. Some people cherish every blade of grass and tree belonging to the public as if they were their own eyes; while a few people regard public property as dirt, wasting or damaging it at will. Of course, we know that the vast majority of cadres still maintain a lifestyle of hard work and simplicity, especially the tens of thousands of rural cadres who brave wind and rain, cold and heat, and work tirelessly and arduously all year round. If we were to leave these unsung heroes who bury themselves in hard work, our socialist construction would be inconceivable! At the same time, the vast majority of higher-level leading cadres have not excessively raised their own enjoyment because of the victory of the revolution. They still remember the hard life in Wangjiaping in Yan'an, with millet rice and coarse cloth clothes. But it is undeniable that some cadres, especially higher-ranking leading cadres (both Party members and non-Party members), have forgotten that China's construction has just begun, forgotten that our economy is still facing difficulties, and forgotten that some regions are still experiencing varying degrees of disaster. They strive to make their clothing, food, housing, and transportation meet the standards. "When those above have a preference, those below will do even more so." So they imitate each other, and it becomes a common practice. This wind is not the gentle breeze of "a sudden gust of wind," but a typhoon of level seven or eight that can blow people with weak willpower into the water. "It is easy to go from frugality to extravagance, but difficult to go from extravagance to frugality." When this unhealthy trend is just beginning to emerge, we can completely adopt the method of "killing it with one blow" (of course, not killing people).

The frugality campaign has already begun nationwide. Chairman Mao said: "This time it must be more thorough... just like washing your face, you have to wash it regularly." Yes, it will no longer be a passing fad, it will form a broad and deep-rooted fine social ethos among the people of the whole country, "We will never withdraw until we achieve complete victory!"

Newspapers and Periodicals Should Criticize Extravagant and Wasteful Behavior

I remember Malenkov saying at the 19th Party Congress that it would be wrong to think that in the Soviet Union today, there is only good and better, and no objects of satire! China in the transition period should be viewed in the same way. In the future, national newspapers and periodicals can expose and criticize the undesirable behavior of extravagance and waste of public funds in order to cure diseases and save people, which is completely beneficial to the cause of revolution and construction.

The issue of thrift has a very broad scope. Using resources when they shouldn't be used or not using them when they should be used both violate the spirit of thrift. What I am talking about today is only limited to the individual's attitude towards public property, and other aspects are not discussed for the time being. I remember someone at the conference saying: My treatment is very generous, I have a private car, a private phone... how much income do many farmers need to provide for me alone! These are sincere words, and all state cadres should share this understanding.

Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, I believe that we will definitely be able to reverse some of the current undesirable tendencies. I believe that the fine tradition of hard work and simplicity of the Chinese people, under the call of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with the joint efforts of the people of the whole country, will definitely be able to be restored and promoted.

For the cause of revolution, the martyrs sacrificed their lives. For the cause of revolution, relatives have shed countless tears and experienced countless hardships. We should cherish the fruits of the revolution and fight against all behaviors that violate the interests of the revolution!

### 养成勤俭办事的社会风气  向铺张浪费的行为做斗争  杜仲和的发言

    养成勤俭办事的社会风气  向铺张浪费的行为做斗争
    杜仲和的发言
    我完全拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上所做的十二项的指示，他所提出的第八项：增产节约，反对铺张浪费，也是当务之急。有些人可能这样想：“又来了，不是反过了吗？现在又反？”是的，我们并不健忘，过去搞过三反，也搞过节约运动，但毛病还未根除，病既重犯，良药自可再用。
   不要忘本
    增产是积极的，广大的中国劳动人民正在努力；节约也是积极的，我想重点谈一谈这一问题。艰苦朴素的作风，是中国人民的优良传统。“咬得菜根，则百事可做。”大布之衣，当时蔚为风尚；草堂茅芦，历史传为美谈。当然，我们并不希望恢复或永远保持中国人民过去的生活水平；我们所迫切希望的，倒是生活的逐步地提高。只是近年来的社会风气，在某些方面，已经逐渐趋于奢靡，这与我们的经济建设是不相称的。我们知道，我们的建设刚开始，我们经济上还有困难，我们有些地区，还有不同程度的灾情。假如个人的生活提得过高，显得突出，这就难免脱离了群众；假如我们有意或无意之间，做了“慷公家之慨”的英雄，那就应当受到道德上的谴责。遗憾得很，这种不良倾向，已表现在一部分干部身上，特别表现在较高级的干部（党与非党）身上。曾看过这么一张漫画：一位局长在办公室门口徘徊，他的孩子从相去不过咫尺的住家的楼上向他招手，“爸爸，来家吃饭！”“等一等，汽车还没开来呢！”这是讽刺，但这是善意的讽刺。某地某机关，建筑一所富丽堂皇的幼儿园。据说：这种建筑，虽搬至苏联亦无逊色，可惜他们忘记了自己是生活在中国。个别中等城市，大力建筑大屋顶的戏院和电影院，借口是便于招待国际友人，诚如陈云副总理所指出的：1956年又重新抬头的某些追求豪华和标准过高的偏向。朱总司令，对个别干部的竞尚奢靡，斥为“忘本”，并谓这种作风，将破坏工农联盟。真是语重心长！党和政府，一再提出“勤俭建国”“勤俭办一切事”的号召，而个别干部竟如此，实在是不可容忍的过犯！
    学习苏联的节约
    精神看到目前的某些不良倾向，这就很自然的使我想到了苏联，苏联建国已四十年，现已向共产主义社会过渡，可是西伯利亚的赤塔车站，依然是帝俄时代的建筑；莫斯科有些中学校的房子，部分还是四十年前的旧屋；医院里用的医药器材，有1956年的产品，也有沙皇时代的旧制。反浪费与厉行节约，他们行之数十年如一日。列宁不止一次的谈过，斯大林也不止一次的谈过。节约对于苏联，早已成为建设社会主义社会的积极因素。记得赫鲁晓夫曾这样说过：我们并不因为大棉袄损害了我们的曲线美而去仿效巴黎的时装。并嘱咐分配到汽车的干部，要自己练习开车，为国家节省人力。我们的建设，正在学习苏联；而节约精神，似亦不应例外。
    发扬艰苦朴素的优良作风
    前面说过，中国人民，一向具有艰苦朴素的作风，而这一优良传统，早为中国共产党所继承。听说毛主席在延安的时候，经常问到有关人员：“我的供给，是否超过规定？”人民领袖对于公共财物所持的严正态度，可以生动而具体的教育成千成万的干部。
    应当承认，一个人品质的好坏，可以体现在他对待公共财物的态度上，有的人对于公家的一草一木，如同爱护自己的眼睛一样；也有少数人对于公共财物，视同粪土，随意加以浪费或破坏。当然，我们知道，绝大部分的干部，依然保持着艰苦朴素的生活作风，特别是成千成万的乡村干部，他们冒风雨、犯寒暑，终年在做着繁琐而艰巨的工作，假如我们离开这些埋头苦干的无名英雄，我们社会主义的建设事业，则将不可设想！同时，绝大部分较高级的领导干部，也还没有因为革命的胜利而过分提高自己的享受，小米饭，大布衣，他们还时时怀念到延安时代王家坪的艰苦生活。但不可否认，现在已有些干部，特别是较高的领导干部（党与非党），他们忘掉了中国的建设刚开始，忘掉了我们的经济还有困难，忘掉了有些地区，还有不同程度的灾情，他们衣食住行，力求其合乎标准，“上有好者，下必有甚焉。”于是尤而效之，相习成风，这股风，不是
  “风乍起”那股微风，而是可以把毅力薄弱的人吹下水去的七级或八级的台风。“由俭入奢易，由奢入俭难。”在这不良的风气刚刚抬头的时候，我们完全可以采取“一棍子打死”（当然不是打死人）的办法。
    在全国范围内，节约运动已经开始。毛主席说：“这次要比较彻底，……就像洗脸一样，要经常洗。”是的，它将不再是一阵风，它将在全国人民中间，形成一种广泛而深入的优良风尚，“不获全胜，决不收兵！”
    报刊要批评铺张浪费行为
    记得马林科夫在十九次党代会上曾这样说过，若认为现在苏联，只有好与更好，已没有讽刺的对象那就错了！过渡时期的中国，更应做如是观。今后，全国报刊，对于铺张浪费“慷公家之慨”的不良行为，可本治病救人，予以揭露和批评，这对革命和建设事业，完全是有好处的。
    节约问题，面是很广的，该用而不用或不该用而用，统统违反了节约的精神。今天我所说的，仅仅局限在个人对待公共财物的态度上，其他皆存而不论。记得在大会上有人这样谈过：我的待遇是十分优厚的，我有专用的汽车，专用的电话，……多少农民的收入，才能供给我一个人啊！这倒是由衷之言，所有国家干部，应当同此认识。
    在党和毛主席的英明领导下，相信一定能够扭转目前存在的某些不良的倾向，相信中国人民艰苦朴素的优良传统，在党和毛主席的号召下，在全国人民共同努力下，一定能够得到恢复和发扬。
    为了革命事业，先烈们献出了自己的生命；为了革命事业，亲人们不知流了多少眼泪，经历了多少苦难？我们应当珍视革命的成果，应当和一切违反革命利益的行为做斗争！
