Talking About Feed Bases
　　Hu Xingzong

In recent years, differing understandings of the term "feed base" have often led to divergent opinions. Many people believe that setting aside a few portions of cultivated land to grow feed for each head of cattle or pig is called a feed base. This is not entirely correct. The term "feed base" is translated from Russian. Its original meaning refers to the system of production of feed crops, natural grasslands and meadows, and the organized utilization of by-products that can be used as feed. If we only understand the feed base as allocating a certain amount of land to plant some feed crops, it is an oversimplification.

Now let's talk about China's feed base and its potential.

Straw, vines, chaff, fallen leaves, and legumes are currently China's main roughage. If we simply consider these roughages to have low nutritional value and fail to make good use of them, and instead want to cultivate pasture, this is something we will have difficulty doing for the time being. The key is to improve utilization methods. For example, green corn stalks, sweet potato vines, and peanut vines can all be made into high-quality silage for feeding various livestock. At the same time, freshly harvested rice straw can also be made into silage or treated with alkali to increase its digestibility. According to statistics from some provinces and regions in 1956, silage from corn stalks alone is enough to meet the annual roughage needs of more than 600,000 head of large livestock. If all the corn stalks in the country were made into silage, it could solve the annual roughage needs of 30 million head of large livestock. Therefore, silage is an important way to improve and increase livestock feed in the future.

Livestock in pastoral areas graze on grasslands all year round. On grasslands that account for one-third of the country's total area, tens of millions of livestock are raised. At the same time, there are also large areas of grassland in agricultural areas, especially in the south, where most livestock rely mainly on grazing. Whether grassland or meadow, they can provide livestock with various nutritious roughage and green feed throughout the year. It is estimated that the grasslands in agricultural areas alone can graze more than 60 million head of large livestock and also produce a large amount of high-quality hay. In recent years, the Party and the government have advocated improving grazing and haymaking, and have achieved great results. The hay made in 1956 alone was enough to meet the annual roughage needs of more than 3 million head of livestock. If cultivated land were used for production, it would require nearly 20 million mu of cultivated land. It can be seen that fully utilizing grasslands and meadows and cutting and storing hay is also an important part of the feed base. In the future, we should improve the methods of utilizing grasslands and meadows and improve their quality.

The working people of our country have rich experience in the utilization of wild feed plants. Farmers in many places use the surface of ponds to produce feed and solve major problems. In recent years, Guangdong Province has promoted water hyacinth. Each mu of water surface can produce enough green feed for 100 pigs for the whole year. Since the province promoted water hyacinth, the problem of green feed has been basically solved. Other aquatic plants such as duckweed and azolla are also widely used. There are many kinds of wild grasses and vegetables in various places, with high nutritional value and large yields. They have always been an important source of roughage for farmers raising pigs. For example, in Horqin Left Rear Banner, Inner Mongolia, where there are fewer types of wild plants, two agricultural cooperatives harvested 180 shi of wild grass seeds and 40 shi of acorns last summer, which can feed more than 200 fattened pigs. The wild feed in the south is even richer. For example, acorns, which can be used as concentrated feed, are estimated to be sufficient to meet the needs of more than 5,000 large fattened pigs in the mountainous areas of Ningbo County, Zhejiang. Therefore, when planning the feed base, we should fully estimate the local wild feed plant resources and make full use of them. This is an important aspect of expanding and consolidating the feed base.

In terms of concentrated feed, the quantity of residue, bran, oil cake, lees, and other concentrated feeds produced annually by grain processing, oil pressing, and various flour mills and distilleries is much larger than that of coarse grains used as concentrated feed. It is estimated that the by-products of grain and oil crops nationwide are sufficient to feed 50 million fattened pigs, among which oil cake is an excellent concentrated feed. When planning the feed base, we must not ignore this potential.

If a production unit finds that the quantity and quality of its feed cannot meet production needs when planning its feed base, it should solve the problem through cultivation and production. When cultivating and producing, it is necessary to select feed crops with high yields, good nutritional value, short growing periods, and multiple uses. Especially at a time when China's grain is not yet abundant, arrangements for the production of feed should make full use of China's rich cultivation techniques: such as mixed cropping, intercropping, or interplanting of feed crops and food crops, or the use of short-term fallow land and barren slopes and beaches for production. For example, in the south, broad beans are planted on fallow land in winter, and their stems and leaves are used as feed. The residue from bean flour production can also be used as feed. Land planted with broad beans improves the soil and has a good effect on subsequent crops. This is the greatest benefit for agricultural cooperatives in terms of production and income. In the north, mixing wheat and peas can not only increase wheat production, but also harvest peas and their vines as good feed. Green beans can also be planted on summer fallow land to increase feed production, which has a significant yield-increasing effect on subsequent wheat. Other methods such as intercropping corn with soybeans and interplanting sorghum with mung beans can all increase feed production. In short, the production methods are diverse, and the effects are significant. Under the conditions of China's small amount of cultivated land and large population, it is obviously not feasible for agricultural cooperatives to expand the feed base without taking these aspects into account, but simply fixing the feed base on a certain amount of cultivated land. At the same time, this will also hinder grain production and hinder the rational use of labor and land.

    谈谈饲料基地
    胡兴宗
    近年来，由于人们对“饲料基地”一词的认识不同，往往形成意见纷歧。不少人认为：为每头牛或猪留几分耕地生产饲料，就叫做饲料基地。这是不完全正确的。“饲料基地”这个名词是从俄文翻译过来的。它的原意是指饲料作物的生产、天然草原草地以及可作饲料的副产品的组织利用的制度。如果仅把饲料基地理解为拨出一定土地播种一些饲料作物，那就未免把它过于简单化了。
    现在来谈谈我国的饲料基地及其潜力。
    秸、蔓、糠、落叶以及荚类是我国目前主要的粗饲料。我们如果单纯地认为这些粗饲料营养价值低而不加以很好利用，却要栽培牧草，这是我们一时难以办到的。问题的关键在于改进利用方法。例如玉米青秸、甘薯秧和花生秧蔓，都可做成质量优良的青贮饲料，饲养各类牲畜。同时，刚收获后的稻草等亦可作成青贮饲料或采用碱化处理以提高其消化率。根据1956年部分省区统计，仅青贮玉米青秸，就够六十多万头大牲畜全年粗饲料的需要，如果把全国玉米秸青贮起来，就可解决三千万头大牲畜全年粗饲料的需要。因此，青贮饲料是今后改进和增加牲畜饲料的重要途径。
    牧区牲畜终年在草原上放牧，在占全国总面积三分之一的草原上，放养着千万头以上的牲畜；同时农区也有大量的草地，尤其南方的大部分牲畜主要靠放牧。无论草原或草地，都能终年供给牲畜以各种营养丰富的粗饲料和青饲料，据估计仅农区的草地就可以放养六千多万头大牲畜，还能生产大量的质量好的干草。几年来党和政府提倡改善放牧和打草，取得很大的成绩，1956年打的干草就够三百多万头牲畜的全年粗饲料，如果用耕地来生产，就得将近二千万亩的耕地。由此可见，充分利用草原、草地、割贮干草也是饲料基地的重要内容之一。今后我们应当改进利用草原草地的方法和提高其质量。
    我国劳动人民对于野生饲料植物的利用具有丰富的经验。很多地方的农民利用池塘水面生产饲料、解决很大问题。近年来，广东省推广水浮莲，每一亩水面的水浮莲可产一百头猪全年所需的青饲料，该省自推广了水浮莲后，青饲料问题基本解决了。其他如浮萍、满江红等水生植物都被广泛地利用着。各地的野草野菜种类很多，营养价值也高，产量很大，素来是农民养猪粗饲料的重要来源。例如野生植物种类较少的内蒙古科尔沁左翼后旗去年夏天有两个农业社采野草种子一百八十石、橡子四十石，可饲养二百多头肥猪。南方野生饲料更为丰富，例如可作精饲料的橡子，估计浙江宁波县山区所产橡子足够五千多头大肥猪所需的精饲料。因此，规划饲料基地时，应充分估计到当地的野生饲料植物资源，予以充分利用，这是扩大和巩固饲料基地的重要方面。
    在精饲料方面，每年由粮食加工，榨油以及各种粉坊、酒坊等所出产的渣、糠、油饼、糟等精饲料，其数量远比作精饲料的杂粮多得多，据估计全国粮食与油料副产品足可饲养五千万头肥猪，其中尤以油饼是优良的精饲料。在规划饲料基地的时候，绝不能忽视这一潜力。
    如果一个生产单位在规划其饲料基地时，发现其饲料数量与质量不能满足生产上的需要，就应当从栽培生产来解决。在栽培生产的时候，必须选择产量高、营养价值好、生长期短、有多种用途的饲料作物。特别在目前我国粮食还不宽裕的时候，安排生产饲料应充分利用我国丰富的栽培技术：如饲料作物与粮食作物的混作、套作、间作或利用短期休闲地以及荒坡、滩地等来生产。例如南方冬季利用休闲地种蚕豆，其茎叶作饲料，豆制粉，渣又可作饲料。种过蚕豆的田地，增进了地力，对于后槎具有良好的效果。这样，对农业社生产和收益来说是最大的。北方利用小麦与豌豆混作，既可使小麦增产，又能收获豌豆及其蔓秸作为良好的饲料；也可用夏闲地种绿豆，以增产饲料，它对后槎小麦有显著的增产作用。其他如玉米间作大豆，高粱套作绿豆都可增产饲料。总之，生产的方法是多样的，效果也是显著的。在我国耕地少人口多的条件下，如果不从这些方面来扩大饲料基地，而把饲料基地只是固定在一定的耕地上，对于农业合作社来说显然是行不通的；同时，这样也会妨碍粮食生产，妨碍劳动力和土地的合理使用。
