　　The Lake brush, traditionally as famous as Anhui province’s Hui ink, currently has a production volume exceeding any year in history and sells well throughout the country, as well as in Japan, Southeast Asia, and various People's Democratic countries.

　　Shanlian area in Wuxing County, Zhejiang Province, is the birthplace and main production area of the Lake brush. Shanlian is also known as Mengxi. According to legend, since Meng Tian of the Qin Dynasty invented the writing brush, Shanlian has produced writing brushes, passed down for more than two thousand years. Now there are still relics of the Meng Tian Temple in Shanlian Town. In the past, Shanlian belonged to Huzhou Prefecture, so the writing brushes produced here are called Lake brushes.

　　Lake brushes are exquisitely made from natural wool peaks of goat hair, wild rabbit hair, and weasel tails. They are known as "Lake Tip" or "Lan Stamen" and have the characteristics and advantages of being smooth, round, and resilient. Using them for writing and painting is effortless and free, and they have long been praised by people at home and abroad. In recent years, the development of national cultural and educational undertakings, Sino-foreign cultural exchanges, and the art of Chinese painting and calligraphy have opened up a broad market for Lake brushes. In April last year, 349 people in Shanlian Town established a writing brush production cooperative, and members of six nearby agricultural cooperatives also engaged in writing brush sideline production. Now the monthly production of brushes is about 300,000, nearly 20% higher than the highest historical output. The quality of the writing brushes has also been significantly improved, and new varieties of water brushes such as "Black Dragon Water" and "Da Jing Water" have been added. More than a thousand cooperative members engaged in the brush industry here have all increased their income compared to before. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　畅销中外的湖笔
    历来和安徽省的徽墨同负盛名的浙江湖笔，目前生产量超过历史上的任何一年，畅销全国各地和日本、南洋以及各人民民主国家。
    浙江省吴兴县善琏地区，是湖笔的发源地，又是主要产地。善琏，又名蒙溪。相传自秦代蒙恬发明毛笔后，善琏就有毛笔出产，传流至今已有两千多年。现在善琏镇尚有蒙恬祠的遗迹。过去善琏曾属湖州府，因此这里所产的毛笔名为湖笔。
    湖笔，是用山羊毛、野兔毛和黄鼠狼尾的自然毛峰精工制成的，因有“湖颖”或“兰蕊”之称，它具有光滑、圆、健的特点和优点，用它来书写和绘画，得心应手，挥洒自如，早得中外人士的赞扬。近几年，全国文化教育事业和中外文化交流以及祖国书画艺术的发展，为湖笔打开了广阔的销路。去年4月份，善琏镇有三百四十九人建立了毛笔生产合作社，附近六个农业社也有社员从事毛笔副业生产。现在每月产笔约三十万支，高出历史上的最高产量近20％。毛笔的质量也有显著提高，还增制“乌龙水”“大京水”等水笔品种。这里从事笔业的一千多个社员，收入都比以前增加了。    （新华社）
