    Basic Construction Workers Enter New Battle
    Key Projects Begin Large-Scale Construction
　　Wuhan Steel Enters Formal Construction Phase
    (Our report) In early March, the main projects of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company entered the formal construction stage.
    In order to meet the country's needs for steel, the No. 1 blast furnace of Wuhan Steel is being built ahead of schedule and will be completed and put into production next year. The refractory material plant and related projects such as coking, chemical, sintering, and mineral processing will also start construction ahead of schedule this year.
    On the vast construction site, new rain shelters and bamboo scaffolding have been erected. Bricks, rubble and other building materials are being continuously transported to the site, and hundreds of workers are excavating the foundation pits for the refractory material plant. Many migrant workers are building temporary roads within the plant area.
    Around the early start of the main projects, various auxiliary projects on the Wuhan Steel construction site, spanning tens of miles, are also being stepped up in preparation for serving the main projects. The mechanical repair workshop, forging, metal structure, automobile repair workshop, and general warehouse in the auxiliary repair facility area, consisting of more than 40 buildings, have all been built and are being equipped with machinery successively, striving to be put into production in July. On the construction site, in addition to the 180-kilometer-long pipeline network and the 100-kilometer-long power line network that have already been laid, tens of thousands of migrant workers are distributed along the line stretching several kilometers to excavate the water intake channels. The thermal power station standing above ground and the pumping station extending underground are being equipped with machinery, striving to formally supply water and electricity in the second quarter.
    At the beginning of this year, Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Corporation revised the construction base plan and formulated a technical organization measure plan centered on saving materials. They originally planned to spend more than 6 million yuan to expand the construction base. After tapping the potential, only some temporary measures need to be taken on site to save a lot of investment. The prestressed concrete pipe factory, which is under construction, will start production in the second quarter. After the factory is completed, the concrete pipes produced can be used to replace steel pipes and cast iron pipes, saving more than 6,000 tons of steel annually. (Liao Muding)

　　武钢进入正式施工阶段
    本报讯　3月上旬，武汉钢铁公司的主要工程进入正式施工阶段。
    为了适应国家对钢铁的需要，武钢第一号高炉提前建设，并将在明年竣工生产。耐火材料厂和炼焦化工、烧结、选矿等有关工程也将提前在今年开工。
    在广阔的工地上，搭起了新的防雨棚和竹脚手架，红砖、块石和其他建筑材料陆续运入工地，成百的工人正在挖掘耐火材料厂的基础坑。许多民工在修筑厂区内的临时公路。
    围绕主要工程的提前动工，纵横数十里的武钢工地的各项辅助工程也都在加紧建设，准备为主要工程服务。由四十多个建筑物组成的辅助修理设施区的机械修理车间、锻造、金属结构、汽车修理车间和总仓库都盖起了厂房，正陆续安装设备，争取在7月里投入生产。工地上，除已经敷设好了一百八十公里长的管道网和一百公里长的电线网外，成千上万的民工正分布在绵延数公里长的线上挖掘进水渠道，矗立地面的热电站和伸入地下的水泵站正在安装机器，争取在第二季度开始正式供水、供电。
    武汉冶金建筑总公司在今年年初修改了建筑基地的方案，订出了以节约材料为中心的技术组织措施计划。他们本来打算再用六百多万元来扩建建筑基地。经过挖掘潜力以后，只需在现场采取若干临时措施，就可以节省大量投资。正在筹建的预加应力混凝土管厂，将在二季度开工生产。这个工厂建成以后，生产的混凝土管可用来代替钢管和铸铁管，每年能节约钢材六千多吨。　（廖牧定）
