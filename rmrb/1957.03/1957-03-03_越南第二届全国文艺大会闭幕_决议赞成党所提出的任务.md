Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 1st – The Second National Congress of Vietnamese Literature and Art concluded on the evening of February 28th.

After several days of discussion, the congress unanimously adopted a resolution fully endorsing the current tasks for literary and art workers outlined in the congratulatory letter from the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party to the congress, as well as the general report of the Vietnam Literature and Art Association.

The resolution pointed out that the Vietnamese literary and art circles have achieved many successes in the past twelve years under the correct leadership of the Labor Party. Vietnamese literature and art, characterized by national identity, populism, and constructiveness, although still young, is full of vitality and is rapidly growing. The resolution believes that the future task of the Vietnamese literary and art circles is to strive for the consolidation of the North and the reunification of the country; and at the same time, to forge a united front under the banner of patriotism and socialism; and to strive for the construction of a rich national literature and art.

The congress decided to reorganize the Vietnam Literature and Art Association into the Vietnam Union of Literary and Art Associations, and elected To Huu, Nguyen Dinh Thi, and 45 others as members of the new executive body.

The congress decided to reserve ten seats for literary and art workers in the South.

Before the closing of the congress, President Ho Chi Minh attended the meeting and delivered a speech. He called on literary and art workers to work hard to study, transform their thinking, delve into art, go deep into the masses, go deep into reality, and at the same time strengthen the cultivation of revolutionary morality. He also stated that the Vietnam Workers' Party and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will do their best to help the development of literary and art undertakings.
