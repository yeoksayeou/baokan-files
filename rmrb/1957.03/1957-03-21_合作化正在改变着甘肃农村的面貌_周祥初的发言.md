    Cooperativization Is Changing the Face of the Countryside in Gansu
    Speech by Zhou Xiangchu
    I am from Gansu. This time, I attended the CPPCC meeting in Beijing and had the opportunity to listen to Chairman Mao's report at the Supreme State Conference (enlarged), which gave me a great education and inspiration. In addition to expressing my heartfelt support, I would like to make the following statement on the situation in Gansu:
    In the minds of some people, Gansu is often misunderstood as a poor and backward province. This misunderstanding is not surprising, because Gansu was indeed very backward in terms of both economy and culture before liberation. It could not be compared with the coastal areas, and there was a considerable gap even compared with some inland provinces. However, this backward situation has changed greatly in the more than seven years since liberation. In particular, since the arrival of the socialist upsurge across the country last year, Gansu's development has been advancing by leaps and bounds. It is really hard to imagine if you are not there in person. For example, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has now been built to the junction of Gansu and Xinjiang; the Lanzhou-Baotou Railway has crossed the Yellow River Bridge and extended nearly 100 kilometers out of Lanzhou. It is expected to be connected to Yinchuan in June next year. The Xi'an-Wuwai Railway and the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway have also been surveyed. It can be said that the province's railways will be accessible in all directions in the future. Except for one county, all counties in the province now have access to traffic. It is particularly worth mentioning that the historically most dangerous Yinping Ancient Road (ie, the Wu-Wen-Kang Road) that everyone is familiar with has now been opened. The Liujiaxia and Qingtongxia water conservancy projects are under survey and construction. In addition, the continuous expansion of the oil storage area in the Jiuquan Basin and the discovery and construction of the Jingtieshan Iron Mine and the Shandan New Coalfield all indicate that Gansu has extremely rich underground treasures. In particular, the Qilian Mountains in the Hexi Corridor, with its abundant resources, have been hailed as China's "Urals." Many large factories, such as power, cement, machinery manufacturing, and oil processing, have also been built one after another. All of these have greatly changed the face of Gansu.
    In short, 1956 was indeed a year of great change for Gansu. The achievements made on all fronts are remarkable. I cannot describe these achievements in detail one by one. I will only talk about some of the situations in the countryside and my personal views.
    In addition to other work, our Provincial Political Consultative Conference also conducted two inspections of the socialist transformation in rural areas last year. At the beginning of last year, after studying Chairman Mao's report on agricultural cooperativization and the 40 Articles (Draft) of the National Agricultural Development Program, we held an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee. First, we examined and criticized various right-leaning conservative ideas, and in particular, we sharply criticized the so-called "Gansu backwardness theory." Then, we discussed in depth the specific plans of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on implementing the "Agricultural Development Program (Draft)," and put forward many constructive revisions and supplements. Afterwards, we held a forum for ethnic upper-class and religious figures in agricultural areas. In January of this year, we organized discussions on the province's "Implementation of the 1956 National Economic Plan and the 1957 National Economic Plan (Draft)." Through these studies, inspections, and discussions, our ideological understanding has been further improved, and the vague ideas about the socialist transformation of the countryside have been clarified. At the same time, we have a clearer understanding and understanding of the actual situation and prospects of the countryside after cooperativization.
    So, what is the situation in the Gansu area after agricultural cooperativization? My answer is: production has increased! Although some areas suffered from drought, wind, hail, and other disasters last year, it should be undoubtedly said that there was a great harvest throughout the province.
    Gansu Province's total grain output in 1956 increased by more than 2.69 billion jin, with a total output of 10.96 billion jin, exceeding the increase target set by the state for the last year of the first five-year plan; cotton production increased by 9.46 million jin, with a total output of 20.8 million jin; oilseed production increased by 118 million jin, with a total output of 370 million jin. The irrigated area was expanded by 4.36 million mu. 3.5 million mu of afforestation were completed. 2.19 million mu of wasteland were reclaimed. Such a rate of increase in production and the scale of development can be said to be unprecedented in the history of Gansu; it is certain that the power of cooperativization would have made this impossible. In short, since cooperativization, the agricultural production situation in the vast majority of areas of Gansu last year was good, and farmers' incomes have also increased. It is understood that among the cooperatives participating in the autumn harvest distribution in the province last year, about 85% to 90% of the cooperatives increased production, generally by about 35% compared with the previous year. According to the results of the autumn harvest final accounts, agricultural cooperatives generally distributed 65% to 70% of the total income to their members, so the actual income of 85% of the members increased compared to the previous year, generally by 25% to 30%; 7% of the members could maintain the income level of 1955; only 8% of the members had varying degrees of reduction in actual income. This shows that although a few cooperatives are not ideal, from the overall situation, the agricultural cooperatives in Gansu should be said to be successful. Therefore, agricultural cooperatives have guaranteed that the vast majority of members have increased their actual income, and the lives of farmers have been significantly improved compared to before cooperativization. The situation of eating poorly and lacking clothing in the countryside has been completely changed. At the same time, after cooperativization, the lives of the widowed, lonely, and helpless people in the countryside have also been guaranteed. Culture, education, and transportation have all greatly developed. Therefore, from these facts, the face of the countryside has indeed changed greatly after agricultural cooperativization; the lives of farmers are gradually improving. Although cooperativization has only been around for about a year, the superiority of cooperativization has been demonstrated to the farmers, making them deeply aware that this is the only correct path to prosperity and happiness.
    Of course, in the process of cooperativization last year, there were indeed shortcomings or errors. As we know, some rural cadres in some places still have a coercive and commanding style; some cooperatives have improper labor organization, too many non-production personnel, and poor management of the cooperatives, not enough attention to sideline production, and blindness in the promotion of high-yield crops, etc. All of these have affected the further improvement of agricultural production, and some have directly affected the income of farmers, resulting in a reduction in the economic income of a small number of cooperative members. However, in my personal opinion, these problems are mainly due to a lack of experience in running cooperatives, weak cooperative cadres, and problems in work style and methods, rather than the result of the cooperativization system itself being bad; at the same time, I also believe that the occurrence of these problems should be seen as shortcomings in progress. These are not the main aspects and are not insurmountable. Therefore, if we excessively emphasize the temporary shortcomings and errors in the work after cooperativization and do not see the superiority of the entire cooperativization system, it is unrealistic; if we only see the bad side and do not encourage the good side, it will also damage the enthusiasm of the vast number of grass-roots cadres in the countryside.
    The above are some of my views on agriculture in Gansu. In addition, I would like to briefly talk about the old intellectuals scattered in society. According to many people, there are still quite a few of these intellectuals everywhere. According to national statistics, I am afraid it is a considerable number. If we can properly train and use these people, it cannot be said that they are not a considerable part of our strength in building socialism. This is the wealth of our motherland. I suggest that the relevant departments conduct a comprehensive survey and registration across the country and gradually arrange for them to have the opportunity to contribute to the construction of the motherland.

### 合作化正在改变着甘肃农村的面貌  周祥初的发言

    合作化正在改变着甘肃农村的面貌
    周祥初的发言
    我是来自甘肃的，这次到京参加政协会议，有机会听到毛主席在最高国务会议（扩大）上的报告，使我得到很大教育和启发，除表示衷心拥护外，想就甘肃的一些情况，作如下发言：
    甘肃，在一些人的心目中，往往容易被误解为是一个贫穷落后的省份，这种误解是难怪的，因为甘肃解放前不论在经济或文化方面的确都很落后，不仅不能与沿海地区相比，就是与内地一些省份比较，也都有相当的差别。但这种落后状况，在解放七年多以来，已经有了很大改变，特别是当去年全国社会主义高潮到来之后，甘肃的发展更是突飞猛进的，如果不是身临其境，确实使人很难想像。例如现在的兰新铁路已经修到了甘新交界；兰包铁路，已跨过黄河大桥，修出兰州将近百公里，预计明年6月在银川接轨；西武铁路、兰青铁路也已勘测，可以说将来全省铁路是四通八达。公路除了一个县外，现在也达到了县县通车；特别值得提出的是，大家所熟悉的历史上最险峻的阴平古道（即武文康路）现在也修通了。刘家峡、青铜峡的水利工程正在勘建。此外，像酒泉盆地储油面积的不断扩大，镜铁山铁矿和山丹新煤田的发现和兴建，这都说明甘肃的地下宝藏是极其丰富的，特别是河西走廊的祁连山，蕴藏之多曾被誉为是中国的“乌拉尔”，许多大型工厂，如电力、水泥、机械制造、石油加工等等也都陆续兴建了起来，这些都使得甘肃的面貌大为改观。
    总之，1956年对甘肃来说，确是一个伟大变革的一年，各个战线上所获得的成绩都是显著的，这些成绩我不能一一详述，只就农村的一些情况，谈谈我个人的看法。
    我们省政协，去年除了其他方面工作以外，对农村方面的社会主义改造也进行过两次视察。去年年初，当学习了毛主席关于农业合作化报告和党中央农业发展纲要四十条（草案）之后，我们曾召开了一次常委扩大会，首先检查和批判了各种右倾保守思想，特别对所谓“甘肃落后论”进行了尖锐的批判。接着又深入讨论了中共甘肃省委关于执行“农业发展纲要草案”的具体规划，提出了不少建设性的修改和补充意见，而后又召开了农业地区民族上层和宗教界人士座谈会，今年1月又对本省“1956年国民经济计划执行情况和1957年国民经济计划（草案）”组织了讨论，通过这些学习、视察和讨论，使我们的思想认识得到进一步提高，澄清了对农村社会主义改造的模糊思想，同时，也对合作化以后农村的实际情况和前途，有了比较清楚的了解和认识。
    那么，甘肃地区在农业合作化以后情况究竟如何呢？我的回答是：增产了；虽然有些地区去年还受到旱、风、雹等灾害，但还应该不容怀疑的说：在全省范围内是大大丰收了。
    甘肃全省粮食1956年增产了二十六亿九千多万斤，总产量达到一百零九亿六千多万斤，超过了国家规定的第一个五年计划最后一年的增产指标；棉花增产了九百四十六万斤，总产量达到二千零八十万斤；油料增产了一亿一千八百万斤，总产量达到三亿七千多万斤。扩大灌溉面积四百三十六万亩。植树造林三百五十万亩。开荒二百一十九万亩。这样的增产速度和发展规模可以说在甘肃的历史上真是空前的；肯定的说，没有合作化的力量是不可能的。总之，从合作化以后，甘肃绝大多数地区，去年农业生产情况是良好的，农民的收入也增多了。据了解，在参加全省去年秋收分配的合作社中，约有85％到90％的社都增了产，一般比前年增产35％左右。秋收决算结果，农业社一般都将总收入的65％到70％分给了社员，因而有85％社员的实际收入，都比前一年有所增加，一般的增收25％到30％；7％的社员可以维持1955年的收入水平；只有8％的社员，实际收入有程度不同的减少。这就说明，尽管有少数的社还办的不够理想，但从总的情况来看，甘肃的农业社应该说是办得成功的。因而农业社保证了绝大多数社员，增加了实际收入，而农民的生活，也比之合作化以前有了显著的提高。农村中已经彻底改变了以往少吃缺穿的情况。同时，合作化以后，也使农村中鳏寡孤独、无依无靠的人，生活有了保障。文化教育、交通事业都有很大发展。因此，从这些事实来看，农业合作化以后，农村的面貌，确实有了很大的改变；农民的生活正在逐渐改善。虽然合作化只才有一年左右的时间，但合作化的优越性，已经展示在农民的面前，使他们深刻认识到，这是走向富裕幸福的唯一正确道路。
    当然，在去年合作化的过程中，也确实还存在着缺点或错误。如像我们所知道的，有些地方农村干部还有强迫命令作风；有些合作社劳动组织不当，非生产人员太多，以及社的管理不善，对副业生产抓的不紧，推广高产作物还有盲目性等等，所有这些都影响到农业生产的进一步提高，有些并直接影响农民的收益，使少数社的社员经济收入有所减少。但这些问题，就我个人看来，主要是缺乏办社经验、社干太弱，以及工作作风和工作方法上有毛病，而不是由于合作化制度本身不好的结果；同时，我也认为，这些问题的发生，应当看作是前进中的缺点，它不是主要的方面，也不是不可克服的。因此，如果我们过分强调了合作化以后工作中暂时存在的缺点错误，不看到整个合作化制度的优越性，那是不实际的；如果只看到坏的一面，不鼓励好的一面，也会损伤农村中广大基层干部的积极性。
    以上就是我对甘肃农业方面的一些看法。另外，我想简单谈一谈散在社会上的一些旧知识分子的问题。据很多人谈，这些知识分子各地都还不少，就全国统计，恐怕是一个相当大的数字，如果我们能够对这些人适当的加以培养使用，也不能说不是我们建设社会主义的相当的一部分力量，这是我们祖国的财富，我建议有关部门在全国范围内作一次全面的调查和登记，逐步的加以安排，使这些人对祖国建设也有贡献力量的机会。（附图片）
