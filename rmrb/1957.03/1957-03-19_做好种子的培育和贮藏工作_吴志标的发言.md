I completely agree with and support Premier Zhou's report on his visit to eleven Asian and European countries and Vice-Chairman Chen's report on the work of the conference.

Now, I would like to express my personal immature opinions on agricultural issues, hoping that the committee members will correct me.

Our Heilongjiang Province is a vast agricultural area with fertile soil. In recent years, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the active efforts of farmers throughout the province, as well as the continuous improvement of agricultural technology, the yield per unit area and product quality have been significantly improved. Especially after the high tide of agricultural cooperation in 1956, the socialist consciousness and confidence in socialist construction of farmers have soared unprecedentedly. Therefore, farmers have become more eager to increase the yield per unit area, improve product quality, and carry out technological reforms. However, from the perspective of agricultural technology in our province, it is still far behind the needs of the developing new situation. How can we achieve the increase of yield per unit area and the improvement of product quality in the future? In addition to improving water conservancy, increasing the application of manure, and improving technical measures according to natural environmental conditions, I would like to discuss the following two issues:

(1) Crop breeding

To increase the yield per unit area and improve product quality, superior varieties are one of the main links. At the same time, superior varieties are not permanent. In a certain area, they will degenerate after a considerable number of years. Therefore, new varieties must replace them to ensure continuous improvement in yield and quality. Our province has not done enough in this link. For example, the "Man Cang Jin" soybean variety, except for a very few areas, has been promoted in most areas eight years ago. Farmers welcomed it very much in the past few years because of its high yield and high oil content, especially its round and smooth grain shape and beautiful color, which were well received in the international market. It can be said to be a superior variety. However, in the past two years, farmers have unanimously reported that the "Man Cang Jin" has degenerated, manifested in fewer branches, sparse pods, fewer grains per pod, high incidence of purple spot disease, serious damage from bean weevil, and more broken grains, resulting in lower yield and poor quality. The farmers' reflection is correct. In this case, we have not bred a better variety than "Man Cang Jin" to replace it to meet the urgent needs of farmers. Chairman Mao instructed us to "let a hundred flowers bloom and weed through the old to bring forth the new." I think these two sentences are also of great significance when applied to breeding.

In the spirit of science serving the broad masses of the people, our agricultural scientific research institutions and breeding experts should catch up and breed superior varieties that are resistant to natural disasters, high in yield, good in quality, and stable in yield, to adapt to the needs of today's rapidly developing agriculture. This task is arduous and glorious.

(2) Good seed storage

Superior varieties are not equal to superior seeds. With superior varieties, selection, drying, and good storage are necessary to maintain their superior properties and become superior seeds. Otherwise, they will lose their germination ability and cannot be used as seeds, which not only loses the superior varieties but also directly affects agricultural reproduction. For example, the "Spark Collective Farm," the first to introduce the socialist system in our country, is mainly engaged in rice production, using electric pumping and semi-mechanized operations. In recent years, the cultivated area has been continuously expanded (now about 400 hectares), and the yield per unit area has also increased year by year, fully demonstrating the superiority of the socialist agricultural system. They mainly use two varieties, "Ishikari Hakumou" and "Beihai No. 1," both of which are relatively early-maturing, lodging-resistant, and stable-yielding good varieties suitable for the local natural environment. However, the rice prepared for seeds after the autumn harvest in 1955 was not well dried and was piled up (with stalks) outdoors for the winter. The germination test results in the spring of the following year showed that the germination rate was only about 50%. Such seeds have lost their production value. With the sowing period approaching, they bought mixed seeds from the Yanbian Autonomous Prefecture. The seedlings emerged evenly after sowing, but during the heading-maturity stage, rice blast occurred widely and seriously, resulting in a large reduction in yield. The average yield in 1955 was 10,000 jin per hectare, while the actual yield in 1956 was only about 1,000 jin per hectare, a difference of ten times. This not only affected the income of the members but also dampened the superiority of the socialist agricultural system.

The reasons for the reduction in production, in addition to the fact that the autumn rains in 1956 were frequent and heavy, affecting maturity, poor drainage at harvest, and heavy lodging affecting operations and high field loss rate, more importantly, there are the following two points:

1. Insufficient attention was paid to the storage of good seeds. Moisture and temperature were not checked regularly during storage, and problems could not be discovered and solved in time.
2. The purchased seeds were mixed and impure, and there was a lack of quarantine work.

(3) Three suggestions

Based on the above facts, I would like to put forward the following suggestions:

1. In rural areas, we should widely publicize the important significance of superior varieties in production, and at the same time explain that superior varieties have regional characteristics. Because the natural environment is different, the superior varieties used will naturally be different. Therefore, we must adapt to local conditions and breed superior varieties suitable for local natural environmental conditions or apply local folk superior varieties to achieve the goal of increasing yield and quality.
2. Our province has established seed management institutions since last year (such as the Seed Department in the Department of Agriculture, and some counties have established seed stations). We should vigorously develop the scientific method of formulating seed grades and strengthen seed quarantine work.
3. State-owned farms and advanced agricultural cooperatives must earnestly implement the seed retention field system. Some farms and cooperatives have established seed retention fields according to the provisions of the Agricultural Development Program, strengthened field management, and adopted methods such as single cutting, single harvesting, and single storage, which have played a due role; however, some cooperatives, although they have established seed retention fields, have neglected management, and the crops have not grown well enough. At harvest, they are mixed with ordinary crops for threshing, losing the important significance of seed retention fields. This fully shows that farmers do not have sufficient understanding of the important role of seeds. It is hoped that relevant departments must conduct publicity and education in the future. The lesson of the Spark Collective Farm in 1956 should attract the attention of agricultural producers nationwide to avoid repeating the same mistakes.

### 做好种子的培育和贮藏工作  吴志标的发言

    做好种子的培育和贮藏工作
    吴志标的发言
    我完全同意和拥护周总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告和陈副主席所作的会务工作报告。
    现在仅就农业方面有关问题，发表个人不成熟的意见，希各位委员指正。
    我们黑龙江省是一个土地辽阔、土质肥沃的农业地区，几年来由于党的正确领导和全省农民积极努力，以及农业技术不断改进，因而单位面积产量和产品质量，都有了显著的提高，特别是1956年农业合作化高潮到来之后，农民社会主义觉悟和社会主义建设的信心，空前高涨，因而农民对增加单位面积产量和提高产品质量以及技术改革的要求，就更为迫切。但是从我省农业技术来看，还远远落后于新形势发展的需要。今后怎样才能达到单位面积产量和产品质量的提高呢？除根据自然环境条件和兴修水利、增施粪肥、改进技术措施以外，我想谈以下两个问题：
    （一）作物育种问题
    要想提高单位面积产量和产品质量，优良品种是主要环节之一，同时优良品种，也不是永恒不变的，在某一地区，经过相当年限，就要退化，因此必须有新的品种来代替，这样才能保证产量和质量不断的提高，我省对于这个环节，作的是不够的。例如满仓金大豆，除极少数地区外，大部分地区在八年前，就推广这个品种，前几年农民是非常欢迎它的，因为它产量高含油率也高，特别是粒形圆滑色泽美丽，在国际市场上，得到好评，可以说是优良品种。但最近两年来，农民一致反映满仓金退化了，表现在分枝少、结荚稀、荚粒数少、紫斑病率高，同时食心虫为害严重，破碎粒多，因而产量下降，品质低劣，农民的反映是正确的。在这种情况下，我们没有育成比满仓金更好的品种来替代它，以满足农民迫切的要求。毛主席指示我们“百花齐放，推陈出新”这两句话要应用在育种方面来说我觉得也有重大的意义。
    根据科学为广大人民服务的精神，我们农业科学研究机构和育种专家们，应该迎头赶上，育成抗自然灾害强的、产量高的、品质好的和产量稳定的优良品种，来适应今天突飞猛进的农业大发展的需要。这个任务是艰巨的也是光荣的。
    （二）良种贮藏问题
    优良品种不等于优良种子，有了优良品种，必须经过选种、晒种、很好的贮藏，才能保持它的优良性质，成为优良种子。否则就会失掉它的发芽力，就不能作种子用，不仅是损失了优良品种而且也直接影响了农业再生产。例如在我国第一个出现社会主义制度的“星火集体农庄”是以水稻为主的农业生产，利用电力抽水，半机械化作业，几年来耕种面积不断的扩大（现在约有四百公顷），单位面积产量，也逐年的增加，充分的表现了社会主义农业制度的优越性。它们主要采用“石狩白毛”和“北海1号”两个品种，这两个品种都是比较早熟、不倒伏、产量稳定适合当地自然环境的好品种，但在1955年秋收后预备作种的水稻，没有很好的干燥，就露天堆起（带秆）越冬，来年春天发芽试验结果，发芽率仅达50％左右，这样的种子已经失掉了生产上的利用价值。在播种期迫近的情况下，他们由延边自治州，买进来混杂的种子，播种后出苗也还整齐，到了孕穗——成熟阶段，普遍而严重的发生了稻热病，因而产量大为减少，1955年平均产量为一万斤1公顷，而1956年实际产量仅达一千斤1公顷左右，相差十倍之巨。这样不仅影响庄员的收入，同时挫伤了社会主义农业制度的优越性。
    减产的原因，除1956年秋雨勤、雨量多，影响了成熟，收获时排水不良，倒伏较重影响作业，田间损失率高等原因外，更重要的，有以下两点：
    1．良种贮藏重视不够，在贮藏过程中没能经常的检查水分和温度，不能及时发现问题解决问题。
    2．买进的种子，混杂不纯，缺乏检疫工作。
    （三）三点建议
    根据以上的事实，提出以下几点意见：
    1．在农村应广泛的宣传优良品种在生产上的重要意义，同时说明优良品种是有地域性的。因为自然环境不同所采用的优良品种也自然不同，因此必须因地制宜育成适应当地自然环境条件优良品种或应用当地民间优良品种以达到提高产量和质量的目的。
    2．我省从去年起已建立了种子管理机构（如农业厅有种子处，有的县建立了种子站），应该大力开展按科学方法制定种子等级并加强种子检疫工作。
    3．国营农场和高级农业合作社，必须认真贯彻留种田制度。现在有的场、社，根据农业发展纲要规定建立了留种田，加强了田间管理，进行单割单收单贮藏等方法起了应有的作用；但是有的社，虽然建立了留种田，由于管理粗放，作物生育不够好，在收获时和一般作物混在一起脱粒，失却留种田的重要意义。这样就充分说明农民对于种子重大作用认识不足。希望有关部门今后必须进行宣传教育。星火集体农庄1956年的教训，应引起全国范围内农业生产者的注意，以免再蹈复辙。
