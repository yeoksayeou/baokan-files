　　Inspecting and Improving Simultaneously, Addressing Issues Based on Urgency and Importance
　　Chongqing Completes Comprehensive Inspection of United Front Work
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 28th. The comprehensive inspection of the United Front work by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) organizations at all levels in Chongqing has basically concluded on the 25th. Through this inspection, which lasted more than a month, many leading Party cadres in various agencies, enterprises, and schools conducted a relatively thorough self-examination of their thinking, and general Party cadres also universally received an ideological education on the United Front policy.

    During the inspection, it was revealed that factionalism and complacency existed to varying degrees among the leading Party cadres in many units. They did not sufficiently respect and listen to the opinions of non-Party figures in their work and did not actively utilize the roles of non-Party figures. Many unit Party organizations also sought the opinions of non-Party democratic figures in their units through small-scale symposiums or individual interviews to conduct inspections. For general Party members, especially new Party members, in addition to organizing them to study documents, Party organizations at all levels also organized them to conduct discussions focusing on the problems and shortcomings existing in the United Front work of their units, in order to educate all Party members to correctly understand the Party's United Front policy.

    Many agencies adopted the method of inspecting and improving simultaneously, sorting out the problems existing in the cooperation between Party members and non-Party democratic figures in their units, and resolving them based on urgency and importance. According to the opinions put forward by more than forty non-Party democratic figures in the entire district, the CCP Shizhong District Committee sent cadres to grassroots units to conduct investigations, and general problems that could be handled on the spot were dealt with at that time. For some problems that could not be resolved immediately, many units also formulated improvement measures.

    Through the inspection, most units formulated methods for improving and strengthening the United Front work. The CCP Beibei District Committee decided that in the future, it would regularly convene district-wide United Front work meetings to help grassroots organizations exchange and summarize work experience. Many units also designated specific personnel to be responsible for inspecting and supervising the United Front work, and the units also stipulated a system of regularly convening symposiums of non-Party democratic figures to solicit their opinions on improving the work. According to the requests of many non-Party democratic figures to strengthen their political and ideological education, the Party organizations of various units have included strengthening the ideological leadership of non-Party democratic figures as one of their daily tasks, and requested Party members to talk more with non-Party figures and become good friends. Party organizations at all levels also decided to include the United Front policy as one of the contents of ideological education for Party members in the future.

　　边检查边改进分别轻重缓急进行解决
　　重庆市全面检查统战工作结束
    新华社重庆28日电  中共重庆市各级组织全面检查统一战线的工作在25日已基本结束。经过这次历时一个多月的检查，各机关、企业和学校的许多党员领导干部比较深入地作了一次思想检查，一般党员干部也普遍受到了一次统一战线政策的思想教育。
    在检查中，暴露出在不少单位的党员领导干部中或多或少地存在着宗派与骄傲自满的情绪，他们在工作中尊重和听取党外人士的意见不够，没有积极发挥党外人士的作用。许多单位的党组织还通过小型座谈会或个别访问，征求本单位党外民主人士的意见来进行检查。对一般党员特别是新党员，各级党组织除了组织他们学习文件外，还针对本单位统战工作中存在的问题和缺点组织他们进行讨论，以教育全体党员正确理解党的统战政策。
    不少机关采取边检查、边改进的办法，对本单位中党员与党外民主人士合作共事中存在的问题，进行排队，分别轻重缓急进行解决。中共市中区委员会根据全区四十多名党外民主人士提出的意见，派出干部到基层单位进行调查，能当场处理的一般问题当时就作了处理。对一些一时不能解决的问题，许多单位也订出了改进办法。
    通过检查，多数单位订出了改进和加强统战工作的办法。中共北碚区委员会决定今后要定期召开全区性的统战工作会议，帮助基层组织交流和总结工作经验。许多单位还指定了专人负责检查和督促统战工作，各单位还规定了定期召开党外民主人士座谈会的制度，征求他们对改进工作的意见。根据许多党外民主人士提出的对他们加强政治思想教育的要求，各单位的党组织已把加强对党外民主人士的思想领导工作列为日常工作之一，并要求党员要与党外人士多谈心，交成好朋友。各级党组织还决定把统战政策作为今后对党员进行思想教育的内容之一。
