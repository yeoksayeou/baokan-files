    Proverbs
    When the people are united, they can move Mount Tai.

                      ＊
    People nourish the land, and the land nourishes the people.

                      ＊
    Don't be afraid of being slow, only be afraid of standing still.

                      ＊
    If you want to be skilled, listen to others.

                      ＊
    If the root is not straight, the seedling will be crooked.

                      ＊
    The more you eat, the more greedy you become; the more you play, the lazier you become.

                      ＊
    Planting fields yields grain, raising pigs yields meat.

                      ＊
    A stitch in time saves nine.

                      ＊
    Planting land without manure is like a blind man without a stick.

                      ＊
    Many people, good ideas; much firewood, high flames.

                      ＊
    A light load can topple a mountain, a heavy load can topple a person.

                      ＊
    People are tempered in the world, knives are sharpened on stones.
