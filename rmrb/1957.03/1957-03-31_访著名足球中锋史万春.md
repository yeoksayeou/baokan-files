　　The famous football center forward Shi Wanchun, whose leg injury has basically healed, returned to Beijing from Guangzhou on the evening of the 29th. When the reporter visited him at his home, he saw him walking home safely from outside. He said with confidence that he would probably be able to participate in football games again by the end of this year.
　　Shi Wanchun used to be an employee of the Beijing Hotel. Years of persistent training and the country's cultivation have transformed him from an ordinary athlete into a national team member. His powerful volley shooting technique has left a deep impression on audiences everywhere. In October of last year, he was selected as a member of the Chinese football team to participate in the 16th Olympic Games. However, during a demonstration match held by the team in Guangzhou on November 11th last year, Shi Wanchun collided fiercely with the opposing goalkeeper, fracturing both his tibia and fibula in his right leg. He has been hospitalized in the Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital ever since.
　　Shi Wanchun said gratefully that on the day he was hospitalized, Guangzhou Deputy Mayor Guo Qiaoran and others personally went to the hospital to see him. The orthopedic doctors at the hospital all expressed their determination to do their best to heal his leg injury. Orthopedic experts from Guangdong Province also studied his injury at an orthopedic conference and affirmed that he would be able to continue playing football in the future. He also received letters from many people in the hospital, including letters of condolence from children in Burma. Many athletes from other teams also often went to see him.
　　While recuperating in the hospital, Shi Wanchun often did "sit-ups" to exercise his abdominal muscles in order to avoid gaining weight. In addition to reading newspapers, magazines, and writing letters, he also wrote down his experience playing center forward.
　　Shi Wanchun said that he really felt itchy when he couldn't play football at that time. When many football teams held demonstration matches in Guangzhou during the Spring Festival this year, it made it even harder for him to settle down. It just so happened that many "fans" wanted to see him at that time. With the permission of the hospital, he went to Yuexiushan Stadium to watch a few games and also met with the "fans."
　　After more than three months, in late February of this year, the hospital removed the cast from his leg. Twenty days later, on March 13th of this year, he finally left the hospital and went to the beautiful Ershatou Guangzhou Sports Club to recuperate, and left Guangzhou on March 27th.
　　Because he did not have surgery, Shi Wanchun's right leg has not been left with any scars. However, after wearing a cast for a long time, his right leg is thinner than his left leg; his ankle is also not very flexible. His current main focus is to find ways to restore the muscles in his leg. He said that he found it very helpful to walk on the sawdust track where track and field athletes practice their leg elasticity.
　　At the end of the interview, Shi Wanchun said: "Let's meet on the sports field again in the future!"

### 访著名足球中锋史万春

　　访著名足球中锋史万春
　　新华社记者　王元敬  郭家
    腿伤基本痊愈的著名的足球中锋史万春，已经在29日晚由广州回到北京。记者到他家访问时，看到他从外边安然地走回家来。他满怀信心地说，大概到今年年底他就可以重新参加足球比赛了。
    史万春原来是北京饭店的职员，几年来的顽强锻炼和国家的培养，使他由一个普通的运动员成为一个国家队员。他那强有力的凌空射门技术，给各地的观众留下了深刻的印象。去年10月间，他被选为中国参加第十六届奥林匹克运动会的足球队队员。但是，这个队去年11月11日在广州举行表演赛时，史万春同对方的守门员猛力相冲，右腿的胫骨和腓骨都折断了，以后他就一直留医在广东省人民医院。
    史万春感激地说，他住院的当天，广州市副市长郭翘然等人都亲自去医院看他。医院的骨科医师们都表示要尽力医好他的腿伤。广东省的骨科专家们在一次骨科会议上，也曾经研究过他的伤势，并且肯定他将来还能继续踢球。他在医院里还收到了不少人的来信，其中甚至包括缅甸小朋友寄给他的慰问信。许多球队的运动员也常去看他。
    史万春在医院里养伤时，为了不使身体发胖，还经常作“仰卧起坐”来锻炼腹肌。除了看报、看杂志、写信以外，他还写下了他踢中锋的经验。
    史万春说，当时不能踢球，心里实在痒痒。今年春节许多足球队在广州举行表演赛的时候，更使他难以安心。正好那时候有许多“球迷”都想看看他，得到了院方的允许，他到越秀山体育场看了几场比赛，也和“球迷”们见了面。
    过了三个多月，在今年2月下旬，医院除掉了他腿上的石膏。再过二十天，在今年3月13日，他终于离开医院，到风景优美的二沙头广州体育俱乐部休养，并且在3月27日离开了广州。
    由于没有开刀，史万春的右腿没有留下一点伤痕。但是长期打着石膏，他的右腿比左腿细了一些；脚腕也还不太灵活。他目前主要是想办法恢复他腿部的肌肉。他说，他发现在田径运动员练习腿部弹力的锯木跑道上散步，对他很有好处。
    在记者结束访问的时候，史万春说：“我们以后在运动场上再见吧！”
