Jian Rennan's Speech
Hoping Taiwan's Military and Government Personnel Will Perform Meritorious Service to Atone for Their Crimes
At the same time, suggest that medical colleges and larger hospitals in various regions strengthen cooperation to make medical treatment and teaching more closely integrated.

Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to eleven countries in Europe and Asia has realized the aspirations of seeking friendship, seeking peace, and seeking knowledge. It has made outstanding contributions to strengthening and consolidating the unity of the socialist camp and enhancing the friendship between the people of our country and the people of Asian countries, writing a brilliant page in the history of peaceful diplomacy. I fully endorse Premier Zhou's report.

In his report, Premier Zhou also issued a call to the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan, urging them to unite, based on the spirit of patriotism and family unity, to face the outside world together and realize the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Premier Zhou's words were very sincere, and people are not made of wood or stone; the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan should be moved by this. Taiwan is still under the control of American forces, and the compatriots in Taiwan are still suffering from the dual oppression of the US and Chiang, living a very difficult life. As a Taiwanese person, I especially hope that the peaceful liberation of Taiwan can be realized as soon as possible. The Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan are not only riding on the heads of the people of Taiwan, but also living a life of dependence, at the mercy of others. They are tools of imperialism. That kind of life is contemptible and also pathetic. I hope they turn back from their wrong path, have a profound realization, recognize that the United States is a public enemy enslaving the world's people, a bandit who has invaded our country's territory of Taiwan, and no longer allow themselves to be used by the enemy, and no longer confront the motherland. Only in this way, by thoroughly repenting of their past mistakes and performing meritorious service to atone for their crimes, can they obtain the forgiveness of the people. The Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan have done countless bad things in Taiwan, their crimes are heinous, and the compatriots in Taiwan hate them to the core. They can only establish meritorious service in the peaceful liberation to gain the forgiveness of the Taiwanese compatriots. In fact, since the call for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, more and more Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan are willing to return to the motherland, and the possibility of peaceful liberation of Taiwan is constantly increasing, which has aroused extreme fear in the United States. Recently, the United States has instigated more pro-American elements of the so-called "Free China" and elements advocating "Taiwan independence" to carry out activities to overthrow the Taiwan authorities. The position of the Taiwan authorities is indeed precarious. Further deduction suggests that those who tout the so-called "Free China" and "Taiwan independence" factions are nothing more than small cards being played by the United States. They are not particularly beautiful, and the United States will not favor them. If the United States can launch a movement to overthrow the Taiwan authorities today, why couldn't they cook the goose tomorrow? Premier Zhou said it well, "Seeking personal gain by betraying the country will not only fail to bring honor but will also leave a bad name for ten thousand years." I hope that those "Free China" and "Taiwan independence" elements will think about their motherland and their ancestors on bright moonlit nights.

Now, the general trend of the world is towards relaxation and progress. The socialist camp is more consolidated, and the democratic forces are more strengthened. Our motherland—the People's Republic of China—is striding forward. The strength of youth is flowing back throughout the country, and everywhere is a scene of prosperity. The Taiwanese compatriots on the mainland are living a happy life. At this moment, I especially miss my hometown of Taiwan, and I hope that the motherland will achieve industrialization as soon as possible, and that Taiwan will be peacefully liberated, completing the great cause of national reunification.

Secondly, as a higher education and medical worker, I would like to talk about the close cooperation between medical treatment and teaching. With the victorious development of our country's socialist construction, the health and medical facilities in cities, rural areas, factories, and mines cannot meet the needs. To solve this problem, cultivating and training health and medical personnel is the most urgent task at present. Currently, the cost of establishing new colleges is huge and difficult. I believe that it is possible and feasible to increase the number of classes and enroll more new students in medical colleges in various regions. In particular, the cooperation between medical colleges and larger hospitals in various regions must be further strengthened to overcome localism and expand the scope of medical treatment, so that medical treatment and teaching can be closely integrated in order to cultivate more medical personnel with both virtue and talent to serve the broad masses of people. To this end, I put forward the following two suggestions:

First, according to the situation of the sanatoriums in Dalian and Lushun, the phenomenon of wasted beds is more serious. Currently, there are more than 30 sanatoriums and facilities in Dalian and Lushun (excluding more than 10 military facilities), some of which have a utilization rate of only 50%, while the beds of the affiliated hospitals of medical colleges cannot meet the needs of teaching and medical tasks. In the previous period, more than 140 patients could not be admitted to the hospital, and the masses had many complaints, not to mention having enough beds for students to practice and to accommodate patients according to teaching and scientific research, thereby affecting the quality of teaching. The reason is that the leadership relationship is dispersed. These sanatoriums are under the leadership of central, provincial, and various agencies, such as the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Railways, and trade unions. Therefore, when admitting patients, they are also limited to their unit's scope.

Suggestions:

(1) The health administrative departments should uniformly lead the sanatoriums and facilities in the Dalian and Lushun area to rationally arrange medical and recuperation tasks.

(2) Some sanatorium institutions should be responsible for some medical tasks.

Second, the cooperation between Dalian Railway Hospital of the Ministry of Railways and Dalian Medical College.

Dalian Railway Hospital of the Ministry of Railways has 630 beds. From the architectural point of view, it can be called the best in the country. Not only are the wards and clinics arranged reasonably and spaciously, but they are also equipped with complete research rooms for various departments. From the equipment point of view, it can also meet the needs of medical treatment and scientific research. Unfortunately, this hospital has not played its due role so far, and there is a shocking waste. The waste is manifested in:

(1) Few service objects. There are only a few thousand railway employees in the Dalian and Lushun area, plus their families, no more than 30,000 people, that is, one bed for every 50 people. This standard is too high. Since cooperating with Dalian Medical College, it is nominally stipulated that in addition to meeting the medical tasks of railway employees, it can appropriately undertake local medical tasks. In fact, the medical tasks accepted by the locality are negligible, because it is nominally open, but it is not registered. For example, almost no non-railway employees are treated in the internal and surgical outpatient clinics, and more than 90% of the beds belong to railway employees.

(2) Because there are many beds and few service objects, the hospital side is very wasteful in order to complete the task. From the perspective of diseases, many are diseases that should not be hospitalized, or even common colds are hospitalized. Moreover, after being hospitalized, they do not leave the hospital, resulting in an average length of stay of 30 days per person. The unreasonable inpatient and outpatient ratio causes a waste of medical resources and, more importantly, affects the attendance rate of railway employees, which brings losses to transportation work.

(3) Waste is also manifested in the fact that the role of doctors cannot be well played. After cooperating with the medical college, the medical college sent 9 professors and associate professors, 10 lecturers, and 44 teaching assistants and resident doctors to work there. However, due to the small number of patients and the small number of diseases, their strength cannot be exerted. More importantly, it affects the professional improvement of these comrades. Doctors in various departments who perform surgery have very few opportunities for actual operation.

(4) There is also waste in the use of houses. For example, the emergency room of the hospital's inpatient department occupies a building that can accommodate 30 beds, and the physiotherapy department occupies nearly 1,000 square meters, but there are very few patients.

(5) The cooperation between Dalian Railway Hospital and Dalian Medical College is very bad. There are problems in understanding. Although the Ministry of Health instructed the hospital to be a teaching hospital of Dalian Medical College, the leaders of the railway hospital repeatedly emphasized that the hospital would not change the nature of the staff hospital. They only recognize cooperation but do not recognize the teaching hospital and do not act in accordance with the principles of the teaching hospital stipulated by the Ministry of Health. There is no leadership relationship with the medical college at all. When Director Liu of the Health Department of the Shenyang Railway Administration came to inspect the work, the medical college repeatedly requested improvements, but no improvements were made.

(6) The leaders of the medical college did not adequately reflect and explain the cooperation situation. Although a large number of people were invested, it did not play the role it should have in teaching.

Based on the above situation, it is recommended that the State Council appoint a special person to be responsible for instructing the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Railways to conduct an inspection, address the problems, and resolve them rationally.

The above suggestions are not comprehensive, and the one-sidedness of subjective understanding is inevitable. Please correct me.

    简仁南的发言
    希望台湾军政人员立功赎罪
    同时建议各地医学院和较大的医院加强合作，使医疗与教学更密切地配合起来
    周恩来总理访问欧亚十一个国家，实现了寻求友谊、寻求和平、寻求知识的愿望。对于加强和巩固社会主义阵营的团结和增进我国人民和亚洲各国人民之间的友谊作出了卓越的贡献，在和平外交史上写下了光辉的一页。我完全拥护周总理的报告。
    周总理在报告中，又向台湾国民党军政人员发出号召，要他们本着爱国一家的精神，团结起来，一致对外，实现和平解放台湾。周总理的话十分诚恳，人非木石，台湾国民党军政人员应有所感动。现在台湾还在美国势力控制之下，台湾同胞仍然受着美蒋双重压迫，生活万分困苦。作为一个台湾人的我，特别希望能够早日实现和平解放台湾。台湾国民党军政人员一面骑在台湾人民的头上，一面也是过着寄人篱下，仰人鼻息的生活。他们在做帝国主义的工具。那种生活是可鄙的，也是可悲的。我希望他们从迷途中回转头来，大彻大悟，认识美国是奴役世界人类的公敌，是侵略我国领土台湾的寇仇，不再供敌人利用，不再对抗祖国。只有这样，痛改前非，立功赎罪，才能得到人民的宽恕。台湾国民党军政人员在台湾干了无数坏事，罪恶滔天，台湾同胞恨之入骨，他们也只有在和平解放中建立功勋，才能得到台湾同胞的原谅。事实上，自从号召台湾和平解放以来，台湾国民党军政人员愿意回到祖国来的人是越来越多，和平解放台湾的可能性正在不断地增长，因此已引起了美国极端的恐惶。最近美国策动更加亲美的所谓自由中国的分子和台湾独立的分子进行推翻台湾当局的活动。台湾当局的地位实在岌岌可危。进一步推论，那批标榜所谓自由中国和台湾独立分子，也不过是美国手中所玩弄的一张小牌而已。他们并不是长得特别漂亮，美国对他们也不会有所偏爱。美国今天可以发动推翻台湾当局的运动，明天何尝不可以烹走狗。周总理说得好，“卖国求荣不仅无荣可得，而且还将遗臭万年”。希望那些自由中国和台湾独立分子，在月明之夜，想想自己的祖国和自己的祖宗。
    现在，世界总的趋势是走向和缓，走向进步的。社会主义阵营更加巩固了，民主力量更加壮大了。我们的祖国——中华人民共和国正在迈步前进，青春的力量，在全国回流，到处是一片欣欣向荣的景象。在大陆台湾同胞过着幸福的生活。此刻，我特别怀念我的家乡台湾，希望祖国早得实现工业化，希望台湾和平解放，完成祖国统一大业。
    其次，我是一个高等教育和医务工作者，想谈一谈医疗教学密切配合问题。随着我国社会主义建设的胜利发展，城市、农村、厂矿的卫生医疗设施都不能满足需要。要解决这个问题，培养造就卫生医疗人材，是当前之急务。目前增设院校费用较巨，困难较大，我认为在各地医学院增加班次，多招新生，还是可能的，可行的。特别是各地医学院与各地较大医院的合作，必须进一步加强，克服本位思想，扩大医疗范围，使医疗与教学紧密地配合起来，以便更多的造就德才兼备的医务人材，为广大人民服务，为此我提出以下两点建议。
    一、根据旅大市疗养院的情况，床位浪费现象较严重，现旅大市疗养院、所三十余所（部队十余所除外），有的利用率只有50％，而医学院附属医院的床位则不能满足教学与医疗任务的需要，前一时期即有一百四十余名病人住不上院，群众意见纷纷，更谈不到有足够的床位给学生实习，与按教学和科学研究收容病人，从而影响教学质量。原因是领导关系分散，这些疗养院是属中央、省各级机关的，如工业部、商业部、铁道部、工会等单位所领导，因此在收容病人时，也只限于其单位范围内。
    建议：
    （一）将旅大地区的疗养院、所，由卫生行政机关统一领导合理安排医疗与疗养任务。
    （二）部分疗养机构，负责部分医疗任务。
    二、铁道部大连医院与大连医学院合作问题。
    铁道部大连医院拥有六百三十张病床，从建筑方面看，堪称全国第一。不但病房与门诊安排得合理而宽阔，并配备有各科完整的研究室，从设备方面看，也能满足医疗与科学研究的需要。遗憾的是这所医院到现在为止，还没有发挥其应有的作用，存在着惊人的浪费，浪费表现在：
    （一）服务对象少，旅大地区只有几千铁路员工，加上家属不过三万人，即五十人就有一张床，这个标准是太高的。自从和大连医学院合作以来，名义上规定除满足铁路员工医疗任务外，可适当的负担地方医疗任务，实际上接受地方的医疗任务是微不足道的，因为名义上开放，实际上不予挂号，譬如内、外科门诊几乎没有非铁路员工就诊，病床有90％以上属于铁路员工。
    （二）因为病床多，服务对象少，医院方面为了完成任务，所以床位利用的情况也非常浪费，从病种看，很多是不应该住院的病，或者甚至有普通的伤风感冒住院的。而且住过院后就不出院，造成平均住院日数每人达三十天，在门诊方面初诊病人很少，内科初诊与复诊的比例达到一比九，住院与门诊的不合理造成医疗力量的浪费，更重要的影响了铁路员工的出勤率，给运输工作带来了损失。
    （三）浪费也表现在医师的作用不能很好发挥，和医学院合作后，医学院派往工作的计有教授、副教授九名，讲师十名，助教及住院医师四十四名，然而由于病人少，病种少，所以力量不得发挥，更重要的影响了这些同志们的业务提高，有手术的各科大夫们实际操作的机会很少。
    （四）在房舍利用方面也有浪费，譬如该院住院处急诊室就占有一栋可容三十病床的病房建筑，理疗科占接近一千平方米，但就诊病人寥寥无几。
    （五）大连铁路医院与大连医学院合作的情况很不好，在认识上存在着问题，虽然卫生部指示该院作大连医学院的教学医院，但铁路医院领导上一再强调，该院不改变职工医院的性质。只承认合作不承认教学医院，并未按卫生部规定的教学医院原则办事，和医学院根本没有领导关系。沈阳铁路管理局卫生处刘处长来检查工作时，医学院再三要求改进，也没有得到改进。
    （六）医学院领导上对合作的情况反映不够，解释不够，虽投入了大批人力，而对教学方面没有起到应起的作用。
    根据以上情况，建议国务院指派专人负责，责成卫生部与铁道部进行一次检查，针对问题，予以合理的解决。
    以上建议是不够全面，主观认识的片面性在所难免，请指正。
