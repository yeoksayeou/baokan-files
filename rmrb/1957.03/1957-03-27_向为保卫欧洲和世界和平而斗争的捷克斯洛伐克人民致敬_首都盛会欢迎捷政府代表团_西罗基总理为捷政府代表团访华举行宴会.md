Xinhua News Agency, March 26th: Premier Viliam Široký, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council and Mayor of Beijing Peng Zhen, attended a welcoming rally of more than 8,000 people from all walks of life in the capital this afternoon.

Members of the Czechoslovak Government Delegation, officials of the Czechoslovak Embassy in China, and the Czechoslovak men's and women's gymnastics teams and experts were also invited to attend the welcoming rally.

Chinese attendees included Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, Chinese Ambassador to Czechoslovakia Cao Ying, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China Liu Ren, and heads of various departments of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee.

At 3 p.m., the guests entered the venue amidst music and prolonged applause. Many spotlights in the venue shone brightly, and a group of young women rushed up to present flowers to the distinguished guests.

Mayor Peng Zhen delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting (full text on page four). He said, "With great excitement, I represent the entire people of Beijing in extending a warm welcome and heartfelt respect to Premier Široký and all members of the delegation."

Peng Zhen said, "This visit to our country by the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic headed by Comrade Široký will surely further strengthen the profound friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak people, strengthen the great unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and will be conducive to the noble cause of world peace and human progress."

Then, Mayor Peng Zhen, on behalf of the people of Beijing, presented a flag and gifts to Premier Široký. The red flag read: "The people of all circles in Beijing salute the Czechoslovak people who are fighting to defend European and world peace. Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak people."

Mayor Peng Zhen then invited Premier Široký to speak, and thunderous applause rang out throughout the venue.

In his speech (full text on page four), Premier Široký first enthusiastically spoke about the friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak people. He said that today the relationship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak people is one of "brotherhood." Comrade Gottwald once said that the Chinese people "can be said to be golden people, and we must learn many things from these golden people." Everywhere we have been, we have been deeply convinced of the profound truth of these words. Everything we have seen, heard, and felt in your country is indelibly imprinted in our hearts, and we will convey them to the Czechoslovak people with excitement.

Premier Široký, when talking about his impressions of China's construction, said that the cause you are building has great international significance because a quarter of humanity is participating in this construction, and because more than 600 million people are taking the socialist road. The socialist construction of the People's Republic of China means greatly strengthening the entire socialist camp, the cause of socialism, the freedom of all nations, and the forces of peace throughout the world. Your achievements are our achievements, and also the achievements of all progressive mankind.

Premier Široký's speech focused on the importance of further strengthening and consolidating the unity and cooperation among socialist countries under the current international conditions. He said that the People's Republic of China and the Czechoslovak Republic are resolute fighters for peace and friendship among all nations, as well as for the freedom of all nations. Our two countries fully support the just struggle of Asian, African, and Latin American countries for national independence, and we will strengthen friendly cooperation with these countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We support peaceful coexistence with all countries with different social systems. We will, together with all socialist countries and other peace-loving countries, repel all attempts by imperialists to undermine the peaceful labor of the people. The Premier concluded by shouting "Long live the eternal friendship between Czechoslovakia and China!"

At the welcoming rally, Beijing literary and art workers performed chorus, acrobatics, and dance for the guests; athletes from the Czechoslovak men's and women's gymnastics teams performed parallel bars and floor exercises.

Xinhua News Agency, March 26th: Premier Široký and his wife held a banquet at the Beijing Hotel tonight for the visit of the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic to China.

Vice Chairman Zhu De and Premier Zhou Enlai attended the banquet.

At the beginning of the banquet, Premier Široký spoke (full text on page four). He said, "In your great and beautiful country, our love and admiration for the Chinese people are increasing every day. Under the experienced leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people are guaranteeing the socialist development of their country with their magnificent construction undertakings and are having a major impact on the entire development of modern mankind."

Premier Široký also said that our visit to your beautiful country convinces us that the Chinese people are irresistibly moving towards new glorious victories on their socialist road and will surely achieve their great goals.

Premier Zhou Enlai then spoke (full text on page four). He said that Premier Široký and the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic have visited many cities and villages in our country and have been warmly welcomed by our people everywhere. They have made great contributions to enhancing the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak people. He expressed his heartfelt thanks to the distinguished guests on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people.

Premier Zhou said that the unbreakable brotherly friendship between the people of our two countries is the friendship of comrades in the socialist family. The Chinese people are very happy to see that the friendship between the people of our two countries is growing stronger day by day.

Premier Zhou said that Premier Široký and the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic will soon leave our country for friendly visits to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Mongolian People's Republic. We are deeply convinced that, just as their visits to our country and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, their visits to these two fraternal countries will also be crowned with complete success. Although we will soon be separated, the hearts of the people of our two countries will always be closely linked together.

Vice Chairman Zhu De delivered a speech at the banquet. He proposed a toast to the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak people, and to the greater achievements of the Czechoslovak people in the cause of building socialism and defending European and world peace.

During the banquet, the guests frequently raised their glasses to congratulate the friendship between the two peoples and the health of the leaders of the two countries.

Also attending tonight's banquet were Vice Premiers Nie Rongzhen and Bo Yibo, Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, and Peng Zhen, President of the Supreme People's Court Dong Biwu, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Cheng Qian, Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, and Long Yun, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Zhang Bojun and Chen Jiageng, Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and Ji Pengfei, Chinese Ambassador to Czechoslovakia Cao Ying, as well as heads of relevant departments and envoys from various countries to China.
