    New Research on China's Population Problem

    China must implement birth control and lower the population birth rate, thereby reducing the natural population growth rate. This is the conclusion recently made by Wu Jingchao in his article "New Discussion on China's Population Problem" (published in "New Construction," March 1957 issue).

    In this article, the author first analyzes and studies the current population and basic social conditions. Regarding the population situation, he says that according to the 1953 survey, the total population of China was 601,938,035. The average birth rate in China is 37 per thousand, the average death rate is 17 per thousand, and therefore the average natural growth rate is 20 per thousand.

    The author focuses on elaborating on the relationship between output growth and labor growth in a socialist society. He says that in the process of building a socialist society, the primary task is to increase labor productivity. The most important factor in increasing labor productivity is improving the technical equipment of the working people, rather than increasing the amount of labor. This requires investment in capital construction, and the source of investment is the accumulation in national income. However, a high population birth rate hinders the rapid increase in accumulation. To illustrate this point, the author gives an example: assuming we maintain the current population birth rate, 600 million people can give birth to 22.2 million people each year; assuming the population birth rate is reduced to the level of Western European countries before World War II (i.e., 17 births per thousand people), 600 million people can give birth to 10.2 million people each year. The difference between the two is 12 million people. Giving birth to 12 million fewer or more people has a great impact on China's accumulation. Moreover, the author believes that the basic economic law of socialism indicates this to us. This law requires us to continuously increase and improve production on the basis of advanced technology. The law does not require us to continuously increase and improve production on the basis of increasing the quantity of labor. To carry out socialist industrialization on the basis of advanced technology, we must have accumulation, which can only be guaranteed with a lower population birth rate. In addition, the basic economic law of socialism also requires maximizing the satisfaction of the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the entire society, which can only be guaranteed by developing production on the basis of advanced technology.

    Looking at it from the perspective of the law of planned and proportionate development, the situation is also the same. The author believes that to carry out production, there must be labor. However, modern production is not enough to rely solely on labor; labor must be combined with the means of production to achieve the greatest effect. The means of production are materialized labor, so there is a ratio of living labor to materialized labor. At present, we do not have enough means of production to utilize all labor in the most rational, economical, and effective way. For example, at present, to carry out production on the basis of advanced technology, each employee needs to be equipped with approximately 13,000 yuan of means of production. According to this figure, calculated based on the accumulation in 1954, if we use all the accumulation for expanded reproduction, then we can only increase the number of employees by 1.3 million each year. This is not much different from the number of employees that can be increased during the First and Second Five-Year Plans. The First Five-Year Plan is expected to increase the number of employees by 5.36 million, an average increase of 1.07 million per year. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the number of employees is to be increased by 6 million to 7 million, that is, taking 7 million as the calculation, the average annual increase is only 1.4 million. However, our current natural population growth rate is 20 per thousand. In this way, assuming that half of the annual increase in population needs to be employed, then 6 million people must be placed in the national economy. This is a contradiction in our national economy.

    To solve the problem of imbalance between living labor and materialized labor, the author suggests that it is best to take the following approach: on the one hand, accelerate socialist industrialization to continuously enhance China's technological foundation, and on the other hand, lower the population birth rate, so that after several five-year plans, China may be able to achieve a more appropriate coordination between living labor and materialized labor.

    The author believes that if China's population birth rate is maintained at around 17 per thousand each year, and the death rate is reduced to around 12 per thousand through the improvement of medical and health services, then the natural population growth rate can be reduced from 20 per thousand to around 5 per thousand, which is more appropriate for China's current situation.

    中国人口问题的新研究
    中国必须实行节育，降低人口的出生率，因而降低人口的自然增加率，这是最近吴景超在他的“中国人口问题新论”一文中所作的结论（载“新建设”1957年3月号）。
    在这篇文章中，作者首先分析和研究了当前的人口和社会的基本情况。关于人口方面的情况，他说，根据1953年的调查，我国人口的总数为六亿零一百九十三万八千零三十五人。我国人口的出生率平均为千分之三十七，死亡率平均为千分之十七，因而自然增加率平均为千分之二十。
    作者着重地阐述了在社会主义社会里产量增长同劳动量增长的关系问题。他说，在建设社会主义社会的过程中，提高劳动生产率是首要的任务。增加劳动生产率的因素，最主要的是提高劳动人民的技术装备，而不是增加劳动量。这就必须进行基本建设的投资，而投资的来源就是国民收入中的积累。但是，过高的人口出生率是有碍于积累的迅速增加的。为了说明这个论点，作者举例说，假定我们维持目前的人口出生率，六亿人口每年可生育二千二百二十万人；假定使人口出生率降到西欧各国在第二次大战前的水平（即每千人出生十七人），六亿人口每年可生育一千零二十万人。二者相差为一千二百万人。少生或多生一千二百万人对我国积累的影响是很大的。并且，作者认为，社会主义基本经济规律就是这样指示我们的。这个规律要求我们在高度技术的基础上来使生产不断增长和不断完善。规律并不要求我们在增加劳动力数量的基础上来使生产不断增长和不断完善。要使社会主义工业化在高度技术的基础上进行，我们就必须要有积累，而这只有在人口出生率较低的情况下才能得到保证。此外，社会主义基本经济规律还要求最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要，而这也只有在高度技术的基础上发展生产才能得到保证。
    再从有计划按比例发展的规律来看，情况也是这样。作者认为，要进行生产就要有劳动力。但是，现代化的生产单靠劳动力是不够的，劳动力必须同生产资料相结合才能发挥最大的效果。生产资料是物化劳动，因此，这儿就发生一个活劳动同物化劳动的比例问题。目前，我们还没有足够的生产资料把所有的劳动力加以最合理最经济最有效的利用。例如，目前在高度技术的基础上来进行生产，每一职工就需配备一万三千元左右的生产资料。根据这个数字，以1954年的积累计算，我们如把所有的积累都用在扩大再生产上，那末每年也只能增加职工一百三十万人。这同第一个和第二个五年计划期间所能增加职工的数字相差无几。第一个五年计划预计增加职工五百三十六万人，平均每年增加一百零七万人。第二个五年计划期内，要增加职工六百万到七百万人，即以七百万人计，平均每年也只增加一百四十万人。但是，我们目前每年人口的自然增加率为千分之二十。这样，每年所增加的人假定有一半要就业，就有六百万人必须在国民经济中安插。这就是我们国民经济中出现的一个矛盾。
    解决活劳动同物化劳动的比例失调问题，作者提议最好采取以下途径：一方面加速社会主义工业化，使我国的技术基础不断增强，一方面使人口出生率降低，从而使我国在几个五年计划之后，有可能使活劳动同物化劳动得到比较适当的配合。
    作者认为，我国人口的出生率，如果每年维持在千分之十七左右，死亡率通过医药卫生事业的改进降低到千分之十二左右，那末人口的自然增加率就可以从千分之二十降低到千分之五左右，这对我国目前情况说来是比较适宜的。 （秋）
