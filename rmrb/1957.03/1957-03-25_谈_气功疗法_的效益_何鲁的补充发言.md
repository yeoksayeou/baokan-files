　　Discussing the Benefits of "Qigong Therapy"
　　He Lu's Supplementary Remarks
　　I would like to make a supplementary statement about meditation. Meditation is now also called Qigong therapy, and it is said to be very effective for the nervous system and stomach ailments. Based on my personal experience of practicing for over thirty years, meditation is indeed beneficial for health. I use the Buddhist meditation method, sitting cross-legged, with the tongue touching the upper palate, and the eyes half-closed, looking down at a point two or three feet away from the body. Focus the mind; believers can recite Buddhist scriptures, hold mantras, or silently visualize images. Non-believers can count numbers. When starting, sit for three to five minutes, and do this several times a day. I choose times after meals and before bed. Initially, it might be three to five minutes of focused concentration, gradually increasing to half an hour or an hour of unwavering concentration. Once you reach this level, ten minutes of meditation is equivalent to a nap, and after half an hour of meditation, you can sleep a few hours less at night. Meditation is a clear and conscious form of rest; you can start and stop at will. Sleep is a muddled and unconscious form of rest; enough sleep is good, but insufficient sleep still fails to restore fatigue. During meditation, blood circulates vigorously. According to acupuncture theory, it stimulates every function, making the whole body lively and comfortable. It also examines all the body's organs, curing ailments if present and prolonging life if absent. Since liberation, everyone's work has become intense, making them prone to insomnia, neurasthenia, high blood pressure, and gastrointestinal problems. Even those who escape illness suffer from excessive fatigue, and when they encounter illness, their resistance is weak, leading to serious diseases, all of which can affect work. If one understands meditation, it can be practiced while riding in a car, whether sitting or standing, without needing to sit cross-legged. After a long meeting, one can also meditate for a few minutes, placing both hands on the knees is even better. While lying down, one can also touch the upper palate with the tongue and focus the mind. While walking, touch the upper palate with the tongue and breathe evenly, and one will not feel tired easily. After mastering meditation, one can cope with even more intense work with ease and avoid many diseases. Our current leaders are all cultivated; otherwise, how could they handle such heavy and complex tasks? A humble offering from a commoner can also serve as a reference. Ordinary cadres, especially young cadres, love their work, leading to over-fatigue. If they can learn meditation, spending only a few minutes each day—but doing it every day without interruption—they will easily learn it. The tasks before us now are: advancing towards science, catching up with hundreds of years in twelve years, and industrializing to catch up with more than a hundred years in twenty years. This is how arduous it is; one person's work must be equivalent to dozens of people's work, and hundreds of millions of people must act as one, cooperating with unwavering loyalty to accomplish the great cause of socialism.

　　谈“气功疗法”的效益
　　何鲁的补充发言
    我再作一关于静坐法的补充发言。静坐法现在又叫做气功疗法，闻说对于神经系及胃病等疗效甚大，根据我个人三十余年实行的经验，静坐对于健康，确实有益处。我是用佛家打坐法，盘脚坐，舌抵上颚，眼垂帘即向下视离身边两三尺远，一心专注，信佛的念佛、持偈、默像均可，不信的数数也可，初坐时三、五分钟，每日必须坐数次。我择的是饭后与睡前这样的时间，起初三、五分钟一心不乱，慢慢可到半小时或一小时一心不乱，到了这样程度，十分钟的静坐，可抵午睡，静坐半小时后，夜间就可少睡几小时。静坐是明明白白的休息，要行就行，要止就止；睡眠是糊糊涂涂的休息，睡足就好，睡不足仍然未能恢复疲劳。静坐时血液巡回有势，以针穴道论，即刺激了每个机能，使周身活泼舒畅，又检查了周身器官，有病却病，无病延年。解放以后，人人工作紧张，容易发生失眠、神经衰弱、血压高及肠胃病等，幸免于病的也疲劳过度，一遇疾病，抵抗力弱，成为大病，都能影响工作。若懂得静坐法，乘车时无论坐立均可施行，不必盘脚；开会久了，也可静坐数分钟，两手分放于膝盖上更好；卧时亦可舌抵上颚，一心专注；行时舌抵上颚，呼吸均匀，不大觉累。静坐法学好后，工作再紧张些也可应付裕如，且可免去百病。我国现在的领袖们，都是有修养的，不然那能胜任这样的繁剧。野人献曝，也可供参考。一般的干部，尤其青年干部，热爱工作，以致过度疲劳，若能学习静坐，每天只花几分钟时间。但是天天要作，不可间断，就容易学会。现在摆在我们面前的任务：向科学进军，十二年要赶上几百年，工业化，二十年要赶上百余年，这是何等繁重，一个人工作要当几十个人工作，几亿人要当成一个人，忠诚无间的合作，才能完成社会主义的大事业。
