Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 5th. The Arab League's Deputy Secretary-General, Ahmed Shukairy, told U.S. Ambassador to Egypt, Mr. Hare, on the 4th that there should be no attempt to internationalize the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba. He stated that the Arab countries support Egypt in regaining its rights over these two areas.

Shukairy told reporters after visiting Hare that the United Nations Emergency Force could only be stationed temporarily in Egypt and could not be used as an occupation force in these two areas.

Shukairy also said that he drew the U.S. Ambassador's attention to the dangers caused by Israel's delay in withdrawing its troops.

    阿拉伯联盟副秘书长正告美驻埃大使
    不准把加沙地带和亚喀巴湾国际化
    新华社开罗5日电　阿拉伯联盟副秘书长艾哈迈德·舒凯里4日对美国驻埃及大使赫尔说，不应当企图把加沙地带和亚喀巴湾国际化。他说，阿拉伯国家都支持埃及恢复对这两个地方的权利。
    舒凯里在访问了赫尔以后对新闻记者说，联合国紧急部队只能暂时驻在埃及，不可以用来作为在这两个地方的占领军。
    舒凯里还说，他促使美国大使注意以色列迟迟不撤军所引起的危险。
