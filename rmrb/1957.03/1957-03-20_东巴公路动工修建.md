Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Construction has recently begun on the Dongba Highway, which will run through the southern part of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province. The Dongba Highway starts in Dong'eluo, Kangding County of the Autonomous Prefecture, and runs west to Batang, crossing four peaks over 4,600 meters above sea level along the way.

In the area where this highway passes, there used to be only a dangerous and difficult post road. It took about half a month to travel from Kangding to Batang on horseback.

    东巴公路动工修建
    据新华社讯　通往四川省甘孜藏族自治州南部的东巴公路已在最近动工修建。东巴公路从自治州的康定县东俄洛起西行到巴塘，中途翻过拔海四千六百公尺以上的四座高峰。
    在这条公路经过的地方，过去只有一条险阻难行的驿道，从康定到巴塘，骑马要走半个月左右。
