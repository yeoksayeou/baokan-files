China Xiehe Medical College Opens Cytology Training Class

(Our Newspaper) News: The China Xiehe Medical College opened a six-week cytology training class on February 16th of this year. Professor Yang Dawang of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the college is in charge of the teaching of the training class.

A total of thirty students are participating in this training class. Among them are teaching staff from medical colleges and obstetricians and gynecologists from hospitals.

Cytology is a new science, and research in this science can provide effective methods for assisting in the diagnosis and treatment of cancers and determining female endocrine conditions. It has special advantages for detecting early cancers, with a diagnostic accuracy rate of over 90%. Therefore, it is also an effective tool for preventing the occurrence of cancers.

Currently, all the students in the class have high enthusiasm for learning. They are preparing to return to their original units after completing their studies to establish cytology laboratories and closely liaise with various departments to carry out cytology testing and research work, laying the foundation for the development of a nationwide cancer prevention testing network.
