Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou: Commercial departments in Fujian Province, adapting to the new situation following the opening of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, have comprehensively adjusted the routes for material circulation, greatly reducing transportation costs for various materials. This year, approximately 1.5 million tons of timber, bamboo, salt, various local specialty products transported out of Fujian via rail, and industrial products and machinery entering the province will be transported by rail. The annual savings in transportation costs will be roughly equivalent to one-tenth of the total investment in the construction of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway.

The largest volume of goods transported out of Fujian is timber. In the past, most of the timber transported to Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and other places was concentrated in Nanping, floated down the Min River to Fuzhou, and then shipped out by sea. A small portion was transported by road to Shangrao and Hecun on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and shipped out by train. After the opening of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, except for timber from the lower reaches of the Min River's forest areas, which is still shipped by sea from Fuzhou, most of it is directly concentrated from the production areas to stations in Guangze, Shaowu, Nanping, Shaxian, Yong'an, Zhangping, and other places for outbound rail transport. The planned 1.09 million cubic meters of timber to be transported by rail annually can save more than 20 million yuan in transportation costs.

Edible salt, abundantly produced along the coast of southern Fujian, has always been supplied to Jiangxi Province. In the past, most of it had to be shipped by sea to Guangzhou and then transferred by rail, a long journey with high transportation costs. Now, most of it can be concentrated in Nanping and Xiamen and transported directly to Jiangxi by rail, with an average reduction of one yuan per dan (a unit of weight) in transportation costs compared to the past. The transportation routes for Fujian's abundant sugarcane, fruits, and local specialty products such as dried bamboo shoots, shiitake mushrooms, rosin, and local paper have all been adjusted, with unit transportation costs reduced by 15% to 78%, respectively, and loss rates will also be greatly reduced.

After the opening of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, industrial products transported from Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places, except for materials needed by Chong'an, Pucheng in northern Fujian, and Fu'an and other counties in eastern Fujian, which are still transported by road, will all enter the province via the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway. This alone can save more than 5 million yuan in transportation costs annually.

To adapt to the changing direction of material circulation, commercial departments in Fujian Province have established wholesale stations and transfer stations in major commodity distribution centers along the railway, and have built a number of timber yards and warehouses.

　　适应新情况  调整物资流向
　　福建商业部门运费大大降低
    据新华社福州讯  福建省商业部门根据鹰潭——厦门铁路通车的新情况，全面调整了物资流转路线，各种物资的运费大大降低。今年福建省经铁路运出的木材、毛竹、盐、各种土特产品和进省的工业品、机器设备等将有一百五十万吨左右。全年节省的运费约等于修建鹰厦铁路全部投资的十分之一。
    福建省外运物资最大宗的是木材。运到上海、江苏、安徽、山东等地的木材，以往大部分集中到南平，从闽江流送到福州，由海轮运出；小部分由公路运到浙赣铁路线上的上饶和贺村，用火车运出。鹰厦铁路通车后，除闽江下流林区的木材仍由福州海运外，大部分由产地直接集中到光泽、邵武、南平、沙县、永安、漳平等车站，由铁路外运。全年计划由铁路运输的一百零九万立方公尺木材，可以节省运费二千多万元。
    闽南沿海盛产的食盐，一向是供应江西的，大部分要经海运到广州，再由铁路转运，路途遥远，运费昂贵。现在可以大部集中到南平、厦门，由铁路直接运往江西，每担运费平均比过去降低一元。福建省盛产的蔗糖、水果和笋干、香菰以及松香、土纸等土特产品，运输路线都作了调整，单位运费分别降低15％到78％，损耗率也将大大减少。
    从上海、天津等地运进的工业品，在鹰厦铁路通车后，除了闽北的崇安、浦城和闽东福安等县所需的物资仍由公路运进外，其余全由鹰厦铁路进省，这样每年仅运费一项就可节省五百多万元。
    为适应物资流转方向的变化，福建省商业部门已在铁路沿线主要商品集散地设立了批发站、转运站，并且兴建了一批贮木场和仓库。
