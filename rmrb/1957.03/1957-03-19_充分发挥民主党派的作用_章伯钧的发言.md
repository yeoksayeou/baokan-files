This plenary session has been very successful. Everyone responded to Chairman Mao's call, promoted the spirit of democracy, spoke freely, and expressed their own opinions. We have launched extensive discussions and put forward criticisms and suggestions on national affairs, science, culture, and various aspects of social life. This new type of democratic approach is worth our efforts to promote, accumulate experience, and improve our socialist democratic system and democratic life day by day.

The era we live in is an era of major changes. We have a keen understanding of the changes and developments in the three aspects of political, economic, and spiritual life. Speaking for myself, I was born at the end of the nineteenth century. From a longitudinal perspective of political life alone, I have experienced three dictatorships: the first was the dictatorship of the landlord dynasty in the late Qing Dynasty, the second was the dictatorship mainly of the bourgeoisie, from Yuan Shikai to Chiang Kai-shek, and the third is our proletarian dictatorship today, the people's democratic dictatorship dominated by the working class. Which of these three dictatorships is superior or inferior is for everyone to compare and see which one is more beneficial to the country and the people. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a person who opposed feudal dictatorship, and many of the friends present today also participated in the anti-Qing movement. The second dictatorship manifested itself in two forms. One was from Yuan Shikai to the Northern Warlords. As far as our memory goes, the activities of the so-called political parties were truly hateful. The second was the one-party dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, which was also unacceptable to the Chinese people and was eliminated by the people. Since the first National People's Political Consultative Conference was convened in 1949, we have participated in the activities of the people's democratic dictatorship. In the speeches at this conference, many comrades have made many accurate evaluations of the achievements of New China, proving that the dictatorship dominated by the working class has done many beneficial things for the country and the people (of course, the three major enemies we oppose do not agree with this statement). In addition to these three dictatorships, we have also personally experienced three types of democratic life, namely bourgeois democracy, new democratic democracy, and socialist democracy. Socialist democracy developed from new democratic democracy and is an advanced political lifestyle after the system of public ownership by the whole people and the system of collective ownership replaced the capitalist private ownership system. This new type of democracy has no precedents in Chinese history, and there is no suitable advanced experience to draw on in other countries. We can only gradually create new experiences and gradually establish a relatively perfect democratic system suitable for socialism based on the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, in accordance with China's actual conditions, the traditions of Chinese cultural life, and the needs of new relations of production.

    Strengthen the work of democratic parties

I. Based on the above views, let's talk about some practical issues.

    (1) The issue of long-term coexistence of democratic parties: Since this issue was raised, there have been many discussions and many accurate insights in all aspects of the country. Now I want to say three points: (1) We must eliminate skepticism about long-term coexistence in our psychological understanding. From last year to this year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao have repeatedly pointed out the reasons for long-term coexistence and have taken concrete measures to enable Communist Party comrades to understand and implement this major policy. The main issue today is how our democratic parties will shoulder this arduous and glorious responsibility. We do not exist for the sake of long-term existence, but for the sake of realizing socialism, and for the sake of seeking benefits for the country and the people. (2) Leading comrades and basic cadres of democratic parties should understand their responsibilities and understand that there are three forces supervising us: The first force is the social force, that is, the people's force. They want to pay attention to whether the democratic parties can do work that is beneficial to them. If it is beneficial, they will naturally support it. If not, they will criticize it and mobilize the pressure of public opinion. The second force is the supervisory force of the Communist Party. While the democratic parties certainly have the right to exercise supervision, the Communist Party also naturally has the right to exercise its supervision. Its prestige among the people is the highest. If it criticizes a certain party, the pressure will definitely be very heavy. The third force is the democratic force within the party. Today, the members who participate in the democratic parties generally participate in the organization to seek progress and improvement, and want to do work that is beneficial to the people and the country as well as beneficial to themselves. They are not here to boost the momentum for certain individuals or certain parties. Water can carry a boat, but it can also capsize it. If the party work makes mistakes, it will naturally invite the pressure of internal democratic forces. (3) In order to do a good job and ensure long-term coexistence, in my opinion, we must pay attention to the following: Do not develop for the sake of development, but continue to adhere to the policy of combining development and consolidation. The past conservatism and closed-doorism was wrong, and it must be changed today, but it is also very dangerous to set up large stalls everywhere on an unstable foundation and to pursue a great openness policy. Under the premise of long-term coexistence, the organizations of the democratic parties will naturally expand day by day, which is unquestionable and should be the case. Their members include the elderly, the middle-aged, and the young and middle-aged. However, if we only focus on development and ignore consolidation, and the stalls are too large, there will be various unpredictable difficulties.

    (2) In terms of the organizational work guidelines of the democratic parties, in my opinion, we must maintain appropriate division of labor with a focus, support each other, consult with each other, and, based on the willingness of the members, we can appropriately cross-over and allocate personnel as needed to facilitate the work. Today, thousands of farmers can form advanced cooperatives and organize work teams. Can't the democratic parties, which are "all parties from the same source and all rivers flow into the sea," cooperate with each other? There must be no thought of who is bigger and who is smaller among the democratic parties, but only the spirit of striving to be the first and fearing to be the last to serve socialism and respect each other.

    (3) The issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries in the democratic parties. Based on the policy of "counter-revolutionaries must be suppressed, and mistakes must be corrected," in the past few years, the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries has been carried out nationwide, which is an extremely beneficial and indispensable thing for the people and for national construction. Many members of the democratic parties have completed the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries in government agencies, schools, organizations, and enterprises, but some cadres of the democratic parties' organs and some senior cadres have not yet participated in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, which is a major event that cannot be ignored. Suppressing counter-revolutionaries was originally a national policy, and it is inappropriate for democratic parties to isolate themselves from the national policy. In many ethnic minority areas, due to special circumstances, the work of social transformation and democratic reform has only been postponed, not abandoned. The democratic parties should be responsible for choosing an appropriate time, choosing an appropriate method, and preparing the conditions for the work to be completed and done well. At the same time, Chairman Mao recently instructed at the "Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Propaganda Work Conference" that a rectification movement should be carried out within the entire party next year, and called on people from democratic parties to also voluntarily participate. We should also make mental preparations.

    (4) The tasks of the democratic parties in the future are even more onerous than before the policy of "long-term coexistence" was put forward. While the development of organizational work has been strengthened, political work, post work, and study work should be strengthened in particular. In my opinion: First, political work can be divided into improving the level of political thought, doing a good job in all aspects of political relations, conducting mutual supervision, and conducting research and discussion on national policies and guidelines and related issues, and formulating constructive suggestions. Second, members of democratic parties must do their own work well and improve it in participating in socialist construction, so that everyone has a career and each career has its own strengths. Third, democratic parties should systematically and under leadership organize members to regularly study Marxist-Leninist theory, and gradually transform their bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideological consciousness through practical activities, so as to become mental workers with the working class ideology and Marxist-Leninist world outlook. Strengthen the relationship between democratic parties and the Communist Party.

II. Secondly, the relationship between democratic parties and the Communist Party, and other issues.

    (1) The issue of leadership relations: On the one hand, democratic parties have political freedom, organizational independence, and equal status, and on the other hand, they must accept the leadership of the Communist Party. Is there a contradiction in this? In my opinion, there is a contradiction, and there is no contradiction. If we understand this issue according to the bourgeois way of thinking, and use freedom, independence, and equality as weapons that are beneficial to the bourgeoisie, that is, to resist the feudal landlord class and to exploit the working class, then this is indeed a contradictory issue. If we understand this issue from the perspective of the working class, and place the ideals of freedom, independence, and equality on the embodiment of social relations without class antagonism and without economic exploitation, then, under the major premise that our democratic parties take the Communist Party as the core leadership force, take Marxism-Leninism as the ideological and theoretical weapon, and take the common goal of building socialism and entering communist society, it is not contradictory to carry out free, independent, and equal political life. Democratic parties should be responsible for their daily political and organizational activities in accordance with the democratic rights granted by the Constitution.

    (2) The issue of how people from democratic parties and Communist Party members get along: Since liberation, the cooperative and daily contact relationship between Communist Party members and various democratic parties and non-party people has basically become increasingly harmonious and increasingly united. However, there are still many problems that need to be resolved. We need to make a more detailed analysis of this matter and have a certain amount of patience. In terms of class ideology and consciousness, living habits, work style, and the position in actual political life, there was a certain distance between the two sides. However, as political life and social life gradually develop, and the contact surface gradually widens and deepens, and after more mutual understanding through study, movements, and work, ideological consciousness gradually becomes consistent, the distance between our democratic parties and non-party people and the Communist Party is gradually narrowing, and will eventually reach a state of no distance. The problem lies with both sides, and the solution to the problem has a certain process. Democratic parties and non-party people must first establish the idea of being masters of their own affairs in work, study, and other aspects, without being inferior or superior, and doing everything to the best of their ability. The so-called "being obedient in every way" is certainly wrong, and even if it exists, it is probably only a small number of individual phenomena. The so-called "flattery" cannot be generalized. Judging from the situation in recent years, Communist Party members have gradually become familiar with democratic parties and non-party people from being unfamiliar, and have gradually moved from worrying, vigilant, and caring to respecting and trusting them. The Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the United Front Work Department have always attached importance to the policy and guidelines of unity and cooperation, and strive to implement them. We cannot use individual, partial, or temporary special phenomena to generalize the entire future of unity.

    (3) The issue of mutual supervision: I only want to talk about one aspect of this issue, which is the issue of the Communist Party supervising the democratic parties. Since this issue was raised last year, the Communist Party, especially the United Front Work Departments at all levels, has conducted self-examinations and invited people from all walks of life to criticize them. Their work has been greatly improved, which has been beneficial to the work of unity. However, we democratic parties and non-party people (please forgive me for also including non-party people) have not asked our Communist Party friends to criticize us, and we ourselves do not seem to have conducted self-examinations. We cannot think that the leadership of the Communist Party is their supervision, nor can we think that participating in various movements is the supervision of the Communist Party. Mutual supervision is a way of political life for the people to carry out criticism and self-criticism on a daily basis. To achieve mutual trust between the two sides, and to achieve having responsibilities and power, it is necessary to implement mutual supervision between the two sides. Therefore, I hope that democratic parties and non-party people will take the initiative to ask Communist Party friends to conduct criticisms in various appropriate ways and change some of the inappropriate ways of working in the past.

    (4) Is there more or less democracy? Since the policies of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision of democratic parties and letting a hundred schools of thought contend and a hundred flowers bloom were put forward, some people have worried that the proletarian dictatorship will be affected and Marxism-Leninism will be affected, and that democracy will be rampant and bourgeois ideology and idealism will raise their heads again; the intention is good. But the view of the problem may not be correct. The proposal of this great democratic policy is precisely the Chinese working class, the Chinese Communist Party, and Chairman Mao, steadily expanding the scope of democracy, enriching the content of democratic life, and strengthening the democratic system, in order to mobilize all social forces and unite all those who can be united to participate in socialist construction, and to promote the truth of Marxism-Leninism, not to open the door of convenience for the bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie, and idealism. In particular, some people are worried that with the rise of the trend of letting a hundred schools of thought contend, idealism and bourgeois ideology will damage or distort Marxism, and some people even say that only idealists can now contend, and Marxists-Leninists are not allowed to contend, which is not true. The crux of the matter lies in the fact that mature Marxist-Leninists can lead the "hundred schools" and "hundred flowers" in natural science, social science, philosophy, and culture and art to promote independent thinking and free debate, so as to achieve the goal of eliminating the old and bringing forth the new and eliminating the false and retaining the true. For a hundred years, bourgeois idealists all over the world have been opposing Marxism-Leninism and criticizing Marxism-Leninism, but Marxism-Leninism has not suffered any damage. I hope that on the day when a hundred schools of thought begin to contend, everyone will have a tolerant attitude, and do not rush to act as "defenders of the Tao" and block the way for those who seek progress or勉强求进步的多数知识分子 when they begin to speak. It is not appropriate to give them a head-on blow to block the road of sounding. There are good components in the old academic and cultural heritage. Let them speak, let them bloom, and it will be beneficial to enriching Marxism-Leninism. There are also bad components in the new things. Let them speak, let them bloom, and dogmatism or revisionist views will be revealed. Those who use dogmatism to oppose bourgeois idealism are the best comrades who are most beneficial to bourgeois idealism. Secondly, there is also an opposite view that democracy is insufficient, and that since we want to promote democracy, why emphasize the leadership of the Communist Party? Why emphasize centralization? This statement would be welcome in capitalist society, but we are no longer taking that road, but the socialist democratic road led by the working class. In recent years, democratized political life has been increasingly enriched rather than increasingly withered.

Further strengthen the work of the CPPCC at all levels

Finally, please allow me to talk about the CPPCC issue: Under the requirements of expanding and consolidating the people's democratic united front, the tasks and work of the CPPCC will be increasingly heavy, and the content and methods of the CPPCC work will also be increasingly improved and enriched. The parliamentary system of capitalist countries has a bicameral system, and socialist countries such as the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia also have a bicameral form of the Federal Council and the Council of Nationalities, and the Federal Council and the Council of Producers; we have our own actual situation, and we do not have to force ourselves to be the same as others, nor can we force ourselves to be the same as others. Judging from its role and development, the Chinese CPPCC is moving towards strengthening and expanding. I think it is possible to consider giving it more political tasks from the third session, such as strengthening the three aspects of consultation, suggestions, and supervision. From the practice of political life, the CPPCC organization can gradually become a democratic link in the parliamentary system needed by the Chinese people's democracy. After this CPPCC meeting, we must further strengthen the work of the CPPCC at all levels from the central to the local levels. I hope that a national CPPCC work conference will be held at an appropriate time this year to solve some of the work problems raised at the conference.

Comrades: I have finished my speech. The views put forward are entirely personal and rough, because I love the Communist Party, I also love the democratic parties, I love socialism, and I also love democracy, so I disregarded my superficiality and mistakes and wasted a lot of your time. Please criticize and correct me.

### 充分发挥民主党派的作用  章伯钧的发言

    充分发挥民主党派的作用
    章伯钧的发言
    这次全体会议开得很精彩，大家响应了毛主席的号召，发扬民主精神，畅所欲言，各抒己见。对于国家事务、科学文化和社会生活各方面，都在大会上展开广泛的讨论并提出批评和建议。这一新型的民主方式，值得我们努力阐扬、积累经验，使我们社会主义的民主制度与民主生活日趋完善。
    我们生活的时代是一个重大变化的时代，我们对政治生活、经济生活和精神生活三方面的变化和发展，都有亲切的体会，以我个人来说，我是生在十九世纪之末的人，单从政治生活这一纵断面来看，就经过三个专政：第一是晚清时代地主王朝的专政，第二是以资产阶级为主的专政，从袁世凯到蒋介石，第三就是我们今天的无产阶级专政，以工人阶级为主的人民民主专政。这三个专政孰优孰劣，大家可自作比较，看那一个专政对于国家和人民有利。孙中山先生是反对封建主义专政的人，今天在座的朋友中也有不少的人参加了反清运动。第二个专政表现了两个形式，其一是从袁世凯到北洋军阀，所谓政党的活动，关于那些情景，就我们的记忆所及，实堪痛恨；其二就是蒋介石国民党的一党专政，这也是中国人民所不能同意而为人民所消灭了的。从1949年召开第一届全国人民政治协商会议之日起，我们就参与了人民民主专政的活动，在这次大会发言中，有很多同志对于新中国的成就，说出了很多确当的评价，证明以工人阶级为主的专政，为国家和人民做了许许多多有益的事（当然我们所反对的三大敌人是不同意这个说法的）。在这三个专政之外，我们这些人还亲身体验过三种类型的民主生活，那就是资产阶级的民主、新民主主义的民主和社会主义的民主。社会主义的民主是从新民主主义的民主发展起来的，是在全民所有制和集体所有制代替了资本主义私人所有制以后的高级政治生活方式。这种新型的民主方式，在我国历史上无例可援，在其他国家也无适当的先进经验可供吸取，只有由我们自己依据马克思列宁主义的基本原则，按照中国的实际情况、中国文化生活的传统和新的生产关系的需要，逐步创造新的经验，逐步建立适合于社会主义的比较完善的民主制度。
    加强民主党派的工作
    一、根据以上的看法，来谈谈几个实际问题。
    （一）民主党派长期共存问题：自从这个问题提出以后，全国各方面已有很多的讨论并有许多精确的见解，我现在要说三点：（1）我们要在心理认识上排除对长期共存的怀疑论。中共中央和毛主席自去年到今年，已经多次反复地指出长期共存的理由并且采取了具体的措施，使中共同志能了解能贯彻这重大的方针。今天的主要问题则是我们民主党派，究竟如何担负这一艰巨而又光荣的责任。我们不是为长存而长存，我们是要为实现社会主义而长存，为国家为人民谋福利而长存。（2）民主党派的领导同志和基本干部应该了解自己的责任，了解自己有三个力量在监督我们：第一个力量是社会力量，也就是人民力量，他们要注视民主党派能否做有利于他们的工作，如果有利，他们自然拥护支援，如其不然，他们就要加以批评，就要发动社会舆论的压力。第二个力量就是共产党的监督力量，民主党派固然有使用监督权，共产党也很自然可以使用它的监督权，它在人民中的威信是最高的，假若它对某一党派有了批判，那个压力是一定来得很重的。第三个力量是党派内部的民主力量，今天参加民主党派的成员，一般是为要求进步要求提高而参加组织的，要求能做到有利于人民和国家又有利于自己的工作。并不是为抬高某些个人某些党派而来助长声势的，水能载舟也能复舟，假若党派工作犯了错误，自然招致内部民主力量的压力。（3）为要做好工作，保证长期共存，依我看，就须注意以下的事：不要为发展而发展，而要继续坚持发展与巩固相结合的方针。过去的保守关门主义是不对的，今天要加以改变，但是要在不稳固的基础上遍地摆大摊子，大开放主义，也是很危险的。在长期共存的前提下，民主党派的组织自然是日益扩大，那是毫无问题也是应当的。它们的成员有老年，有中年，也应当有青壮年，但是只贪发展，不顾巩固，摊子过度大了，会有种种难以逆料的困难产生出来的。
    （二）民主党派在组织工作方针方面，其相互之间的关系，依我看，还要保持适当的重点分工，互相支援，互相协商，依据成员的自愿，在有利于工作的需要上，可以适当的交叉，也可以进行调配，今天成千成万的农民可以成立高级合作社，可以组织工作队，难道“万派同源，百川归海”的民主党派，还不能进行互相合作吗？在民主党派之间绝不能存有谁大谁小的思想，而只应有争先恐后为社会主义服务和互相尊重的精神。
    （三）民主党派的肃反问题。根据“有反必肃，有错必纠”的方针，几年来，在全国范围内，进行了肃反工作，这对于人民对于国家建设是一件极有益的不可少的事情，民主党派很多成员在机关、学校、团体和企业内完成了肃反工作，但是还有些民主党派机关干部和一些高级干部尚没有参加肃反运动，这是不可忽视的一件大事。肃反原是国家的政策，民主党派如自外于国家政策，那是不妥当的。在许多少数民族地区，因有特殊情况，只是推迟了社会改造和民主改革工作，而不是放弃了改造和改革。民主党派应当自己负责选择适当时间，选择适当方式，准备工作条件来把肃反工作做完做好。同时毛主席最近在“中共中央宣传工作会议”上，指示明年要在全党范围内进行整风运动，并号召民主党派人士也可自愿参加。我们也应作精神准备。
    （四）今后民主党派的工作任务，比提出“长期共存”方针以前，是更有所加重的。发展组织工作固然加强了，但是政治工作、岗位工作和学习工作尤当加强。依我看来：第一，政治工作可分为政治思想水平的提高，搞好各方面的政治关系，进行互相监督，和对国家政策方针及有关问题进行研究与讨论，并制定建设性的建议。第二，民主党派成员在参加社会主义建设中，须要做好自己的工作并加以提高，做到人有一业，业有所长。第三，民主党派应当有计划地有领导地组织成员经常学习马列主义理论，并通过实践的活动，逐步改造自己的资产阶级和小资产阶级思想意识，使成为具有工人阶级思想马列主义世界观的脑力劳动者。密切民主党派和共产党的关系
    二、其次民主党派与共产党的关系问题，和其他问题。
    （1）领导关系问题：民主党派一面有政治自由、组织独立和地位平等，而另一面又要接受共产党的领导，这是否有矛盾？照我看来，有矛盾，也没有矛盾。如果依照资产阶级的思想方法来认识这一问题，把自由独立和平等用作对资产阶级有利的武器，即对封建地主阶级的反抗和对工人阶级的剥削来使用，这诚然是一个矛盾问题。如果从工人阶级的观点来认识这一个问题，把自由独立和平等的理想放在无阶级对抗、无经济剥削的社会关系的体现上面，那末，我们民主党派在以共产党为领导核心力量，以马列主义为思想理论武器，而又以建设社会主义共同进入共产主义社会为奋斗目标这个大前提之下，来进行自由独立平等的政治生活，那是没有矛盾的。民主党派依据宪法所予的民主权利对于日常政治活动和组织活动就应当自己负责。
    （2）民主党派人士与共产党党员共处的方式问题：解放以后，共产党员与各民主党派和无党派人士之间互相合作和日常生活接触关系基本上是日趋融洽，日趋团结的。但问题依然不少，有待解决。我们对此事要作比较细致的分析，要有一定的耐心。在阶级思想意识方面，生活习惯和工作作风方面，以及在实际政治生活中所处的地位方面，这在双方原有一定距离的。但是从政治生活和社会生活逐步发展，接触面渐广渐深以后，再经过学习、运动和工作中更加相互了解，思想意识渐趋一致，我们民主党派和无党派人士与共产党之间的距离是逐渐缩小了，而最后会达到无距离的境地。问题是双方的，问题的解决是有一定过程的，民主党派和无党派人士无论在工作上学习上和其他各方面，要首先确立主人翁的思想，不必自卑，也不必自高，一切尽其在我。所谓“百依百顺”固属非是，即有，也恐怕只是少数个别现象。所谓“阿谀奉迎”更不能概括一切。依几年来的情形看，共产党员对民主党派和无党派人士，是由生疏而逐渐进到相熟，由顾虑警惕照顾而逐渐进到尊重和信任，党中央、毛主席和统战部是经常重视团结合作的政策方针，并力求贯彻执行的。我们不能用个别的局部的或暂时的特殊现象，来概括全部或团结的前途。
    （3）互相监督问题：我对这个问题只想谈一个方面，就是共产党对民主党派进行监督问题。自从这个问题在去年提出以后，共产党特别是各级统战部进行了自我检查和邀请各方人士进行批评，他们的工作有了不少的改善，对于团结工作有所裨益。但是我们民主党派和无党派人士（请恕我把无党派人士也拉进来）却未曾向共产党朋友要求给以批评，我们自己也好像没有进行自我检查。我们不能以为共产党的领导就是他们的监督，又不能以为参加了各个运动就是共产党的监督。互相监督是一种人民内部日常进行批评与自我批评的政治生活方式。要做到双方互相信赖，做到有职有权，实行双方互相监督是必要的。因此我希望民主党派和无党派人士，要采取主动，要求共产党朋友，选择各种适当方式，进行批评，把过去的某些不恰当的工作方式改变一下。
    （4）民主多了呢还是少了呢？自从民主党派长期共存互相监督和百家争鸣百花齐放的方针提出以后，有一些人担心无产阶级专政将受到影响，马列主义将受到影响，恐怕民主泛滥，资产阶级思想和唯心主义又将抬起头来；用心是善的。但是对问题的看法恐怕不正确，这个伟大的民主方针之提出，正是中国工人阶级中国共产党和毛主席，稳步地扩充民主范围，丰富民主生活内容，和加强民主制度，以便调动一切社会力量，团结一切可能团结的人士，来参加社会主义建设工作，发扬马列主义真理，绝不是为资产阶级小资产阶级和唯心主义开方便之门。特别有人忧虑到百家争鸣之风起，唯心主义和资产阶级思想会把马克思主义损伤了或曲解了，甚至有人说现在只有唯心主义者能争鸣，马列主义者不许争鸣，这是不符事实的。问题的中心在于成熟的马列主义者能领导 “百家”和“百花”在自然科学、社会科学，哲学和文化艺术各方面发扬独立思考、自由辩论，达到推陈出新、去伪求真的目的。一百年来全世界资产阶级的唯心主义者都在反对马列主义，批评马列主义，但是马列主义并没有受到任何损伤。我希望在百家开始争鸣的今日，大家要有宽容的心情，不要急于以“卫道者”自居，对那些求进步或勉强求进步的多数知识分子，开始发言的时候就给他们拦头一棒，以阻塞鸣路，这是不妥当的。旧的学术文化遗产中，有好的成份，让他们鸣，让他们放，对丰富马列主义是有益的。新的东西里面也有坏成份，让他们鸣，让他们放，教条主义或修正观点也就会显露出来。凡是用教条主义反资产阶级唯心主义的人是最有利于资产阶级唯心主义的好同志。其次，又有一种相反的看法，认为民主不足，认为既要发扬民主，又何必强调共产党的领导？何必强调集中？这个说法如在资本主义社会里说是受人欢迎的，但是我们已经不是走那条道路，而是走的工人阶级领导的社会主义的民主道路。最近几年来，民主化的政治生活正在日益丰富而不是日益枯缩。
    进一步加强各级政协的工作
    最后请允许我谈谈政协问题：在扩大和巩固人民民主统一战线的要求下，政协的任务和工作是将要日益加重起来的，政协工作的内容和方法也将要日趋完善和充实的。资本主义国家议会制度有两院制，社会主义国家如苏联和南斯拉夫也有联邦院与民族院，和联邦院与生产者院的两院形式；我们有我们自己的实际情况，不必强同于人，也不能强同于人。中国政协从作用与发展来看，它正走向加强和扩大。我认为可以考虑到从第三届起给以更多的政治任务，如协商建议和监督三方面权力是可以加强起来的。从实践政治生活中，政协这个组织可以逐渐成为中国人民民主所需要的议会制度的民主一环。这次政协会议以后，我们对于从中央到地方各级政协工作要进一步地加强起来，我希望要在今年适当时间召开一个全国政协工作会议，解决一些大会上所提出的工作问题。
    同志们：我的话谈完了，所提出的看法完全是个人的，粗糙的，因为我爱护共产党，也爱护民主党派，我爱护社会主义，也爱护民主，所以不顾粗浅和错误，浪费了同志们许多时间，请同志们批评和指正。
