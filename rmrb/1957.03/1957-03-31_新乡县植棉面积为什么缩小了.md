　　Recently, I stayed for a few days in Xinxiang County, Henan Province, a cotton-producing area. The cotton planting here will begin after the Qingming Festival. Currently, from the county leaders to the members of the various agricultural production cooperatives, everyone is busily engaged in selecting and fumigating cotton seeds, applying base fertilizer to the cotton fields, and carrying out spring plowing, harrowing, and irrigating to preserve soil moisture.

　　However, the cotton planting plan in Xinxiang County is a matter worth discussing. Last year, the county's cotton planting area was 298,000 mu, but this year it is only planned to plant 263,000 mu, which is 35,000 mu less than last year, and 6,000 mu less than the planting area target set by the province. According to statistics, the total number of mu contracted to agricultural cooperatives for planting is only over 255,000 mu, which is another 7,000 to 8,000 mu less than the county's plan.

　　Why has the cotton planting area here decreased? According to Hu Shaohua, Secretary of the Xinxiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC): "Xinxiang County has historically planted 250,000 to 260,000 mu of cotton. Last year, it suddenly expanded to nearly 300,000 mu, and many areas were not suitable. This year, these areas have reduced planting." Of course, areas that are not suitable for cotton planting should adapt to local conditions and appropriately reduce the cotton planting area. However, it is worth noting that the planned cotton planting area in areas that have historically been the center of cotton production in Xinxiang County, such as Qiliying and Xiaoji townships, has also decreased this year. Last year, Qiliying Township (including nine agricultural cooperatives such as Qiliying, Caozhuang, and Baliushu) had a cotton planting area of more than 59,000 mu. This year, the county allocated a target of 54,000 mu to the township, but the township's planting area plan has been further reduced to over 50,300 mu. Last year, Xiaoji Township (including seven agricultural cooperatives such as Xiaoji, Shibei Songfo) had a cotton planting area of over 31,000 mu, but this year it is only planned to plant over 28,000 mu, a decrease of more than 2,800 mu compared to last year. What are the reasons for the reduction in the planned planting area in these suitable cotton planting areas? Yang Zhitian, Secretary of the CPC Xiaoji Township Branch, and Wang Wensheng, Director of the Qiliying Agricultural Cooperative, both told me that this was the planned cotton planting area under the spirit of the county party committee's instructions to ensure that people have food to eat and livestock have grass to feed. Hu Shaohua, Secretary of the Xinxiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China, also said: "Planning the cotton planting area under the principle of ensuring that people have food to eat and livestock have fodder is the implementation of the province's instructions." Yes, completing the state's cotton planting plan under the principle of ensuring that people have food to eat and livestock have fodder is what the leaders of Henan Province have proposed. However, the guarantee proposed by the leaders of Henan Province to ensure people have food to eat and livestock have fodder refers to adjusting within the county unit according to local conditions to achieve the province's target. The targets allocated by the province to each county have already taken into account the issue of people's food and livestock feed. From the perspective of the leaders of Xinxiang County, they have not understood the intention of the province.

　　Xinxiang County has lacked rain and snow this winter and spring, and the cotton fields are dry. Except for a small portion that has been winter-irrigated (this is a Yellow River irrigation area) and promptly spring-plowed, retaining some bottom moisture, most of the cotton fields lack moisture. If we do not seize the time to irrigate the gullies and preserve moisture, the cotton sowing cannot be guaranteed to be timely, which will also affect the planting area. The Qincunying Agricultural Cooperative has more than 5,700 mu of cotton fields, but as of March 16th, only 350 mu have been irrigated, and the remaining large part is dry and lacks moisture. Some cooperative cadres believe that if the land is dry and lacks moisture, and the cotton cannot be guaranteed to be sown in a timely manner, it would be better to change to planting food crops. The CPC Xinxiang County Committee is paying attention to solving this problem. However, some county committee members are not yet firm and clear in their guiding ideology. Someone said: "If timely sowing of cotton cannot be guaranteed, then plant more food crops." At the same time, many cadres are starting solely from the needs of their own units and advocating for reducing the cotton planting area. If this problem is not completely resolved, I am afraid that even the current lower planned area will be difficult to guarantee.

　　From the perspective of the vast majority of farmers, they do not demand a reduction in the cotton planting area. When I talked with the members of agricultural cooperatives such as Qiliying, Shibei, and Songfo, I learned that they can all calculate that planting cotton brings in more income than planting food crops. The cadres in the county and townships also know this. They all say: "The members are willing to plant more cotton." However, because the cadres above the team leader of the cooperative have to be "responsible for people's food and livestock feed," they dare not plant more cotton. The leaders of the townships and counties are also carrying ideological burdens on this issue. However, they are unwilling to directly raise the issue. They say to the higher authorities: "It doesn't matter if the planting area is reduced a bit. We will increase the yield per unit area and guarantee the completion of the total output task." In fact? Without firm confidence in the planting area and lacking specific measures to increase the yield per unit area, isn't the so-called "guarantee that the total output task will not be reduced" just empty talk!

　　Indeed, there are practical problems with the people's food and livestock feed in the cotton-producing areas. However, as long as adjustments are made throughout the county, with more cotton being planted in areas suitable for cotton planting and appropriately less in unsuitable areas, and combined with continuing to implement the three-fixed policy for grain and adjusting the fixed amount of rations more reasonably according to different households, the cotton planting plan can be guaranteed, and the people's food and livestock feed in the cotton-producing areas can also be guaranteed. Xinxiang County has a total population of 230,000 and a total cultivated land of 720,000 mu. According to the cotton planting area target allocated by the province, it is only 269,000 mu. As long as adjustments are made well and the planting of livestock feed is organized in a planned way, the problem can be solved.

　　新乡县植棉面积为什么缩小了
　　本报记者  王昌隆
    最近，我到河南省产棉区的新乡县住了几天。这里过了清明就要开始种棉。目前，从县的领导到各个农业生产合作社的社员们，都在紧张地进行着棉种的拣选熏蒸，棉田施底肥，春耕、耙耱和浇灌保墒等工作。
    但是，新乡县的棉花种植计划，是一个值得商榷的问题。去年这个县棉花种植面积是二十九万八千亩，而今年只计划种植二十六万三千亩，比去年要少种三万五千亩，比省里提出的种植面积计划指标少六千亩。另据统计，全县各农业社包工包产的种植亩数只二十五万五千多亩，这比县的计划又减少了七八千亩。
    这里的棉花种植面积为什么减少了呢？据中共新乡县委书记胡少华谈：“新乡县历年来棉花种植就是二十五、六万亩，去年猛一扩大到近三十万亩，有好多地区是不适宜的，今年就是这些地区少种了。”当然，不适宜种植棉花的地区，应该因地制宜，适当缩减棉花种植面积。可是，值得注意的是，像历来是新乡县产棉区的中心地带——七里营、小冀等乡，今年的计划植棉面积也减少了。七里营乡（包括七里营、曹庄、八柳树等九个农业社）去年棉花种植面积五万九千多亩，今年县里分配给这个乡的指标减少为五万四千亩，而乡里的种植面积计划又减少为五万零三百多亩；小冀乡（包括小冀、石碑宋佛等七个农业社）去年棉花种植面积三万一千多亩，今年只计划种植二万八千多亩，比去年减少二千八百多亩。这些适宜植棉的地区，计划种植面积减少的原因又是什么呢？中共小冀乡支部书记杨治田、七里营农业社主任王文生都告我说：这是在县委指示保证人有粮食吃、牲口有草喂的精神下，计划的棉花种植面积。中共新乡县委书记胡少华也说：“在保证人吃马喂的原则下，计划棉花的种植面积，是执行省里的指示。”是的，在保证人吃马喂的原则下，完成国家棉花种植计划，这是河南省领导上提出的。但河南省领导上提出的保证人吃马喂，是指以县为单位，在一县之内因地制宜地进行调剂，达到省里的指标。省所分配给各县的指标已经照顾了人吃马喂的问题了。从新乡县领导上看，是没有领会省里的意图的。
    新乡县去冬今春缺少雨雪，棉田干旱。除少部分经过冬灌（这里是引黄灌区）和及时春耕，还保有底墒外，大部棉田是缺墒的。如果不抓紧冲沟浇灌、保墒，棉花播种就不能保证适时，对种植面积也是有影响的。秦村营农业社有五千七百多亩棉田，截至3月16日只浇灌三百五十亩，其余大部分干旱没墒。有的社干部认为：地里干旱没墒，棉花不能保证适时播种，就改种成粮食作物好了。这个问题，中共新乡县委正在注意解决。但也有个别县委委员在指导思想上还不是那末坚定、明确。有人说：“不能保证棉花的适时播种，就多种些粮食作物吧。”同时还有不少干部单从本单位的需要出发，主张减少棉花种植面积。这个问题如不彻底解决，恐怕连现在这样较低的计划面积也难以保证。
    从广大农民的思想来看，他们并不要求减少棉花的种植面积。我在七里营、石碑、宋佛等农业社同社员们接谈的时候了解，他们都会算种棉花比种粮食作物收入多的账。这一点，县里和乡里的干部也是知道的，他们都说：社员们是愿意多种棉花的。但由于社的队长以上干部要对“人吃马喂负责”，不敢多种棉花；乡和县的领导干部也为这个问题背着思想包袱。可是他们却不愿直接了当地把问题提出来。他们对上边说：“减少点种植面积没关系，我们提高单位面积产量，保证完成总产量任务就是了。”事实上呢？对种植面积没有坚定信心，对提高单位面积产量又缺少具体措施，那么所说“保证总产量任务不减少”岂不是空谈！
    确实，棉产区在人的吃粮上、牲口饲草上，是有实际问题存在的。但只要从全县范围内进行调剂，适宜种植棉花的地区多种些棉花，不适宜的地区适当减少一些，再加上结合继续贯彻粮食三定政策，根据不同农户把口粮的定量调剂得更加合理，这样既可以保证完成棉花的种植计划，又可以保证棉产区的人吃马喂。新乡县全县人口二十三万，总耕地七十二万亩，按省里分配给的棉花种植面积计划指标也只二十六万九千亩，只要调剂得好，并且有计划地组织牲口饲草种植，问题是可以解决的。
