　　Going to Backward Villages
　　By Our Correspondents Lin Li and Xiang Qing

Editor's Note: To comprehensively improve spring plowing and production, it is not enough to focus only on a few advanced agricultural cooperatives. A reliable guarantee for a bumper harvest in agriculture lies in overall improvement. However, leadership resources are limited, and they cannot be evenly distributed. What should be done? The experience of many places has proven that it is necessary to "grasp both ends" – focusing on both the advanced and the backward. Backward cooperatives often have more problems, and strengthening leadership in these cooperatives can provide valuable experience in problem-solving. Many places in Guangdong Province have paid special attention to strengthening leadership in backward villages and cooperatives, with noticeable results. It should be noted that: 1. Advanced and backward cooperatives should not be treated in isolation. The experiences gained from both should be promptly disseminated and applied comprehensively. 2. Advanced and backward cooperatives should not be seen as fixed entities but should be viewed dynamically, and leadership resources should be applied flexibly based on changing circumstances.

The spring plowing campaign in Guangdong Province sees new developments every day. However, amidst the bustling atmosphere, some villages and cooperatives are lagging behind, with low morale among members and sluggish production. How to effectively change the situation in these backward villages and cooperatives during the spring plowing season is one of the most pressing issues that need to be addressed.

These villages and cooperatives that have fallen behind in the production campaign are estimated to account for about 10% to 15% of the total in the province. Even in agricultural cooperatives where the overall work is going well, some production teams or a portion of the members have not been mobilized or are not working effectively. For example, Panyu County conducted a survey some time ago, revealing that while 15% of the cooperatives in the county were lagging behind, as many as 20% of the production teams were not performing well.

The season is becoming increasingly urgent! These villages and cooperatives face the risk of missing the agricultural season, leaving fields uncultivated, and performing sloppy work. It is clear that if we do not act quickly, the province's production increase plan for striving for a bumper harvest in 1957 will be affected, and the goal of achieving increased production in 90% of the cooperatives and increased income for 90% of the members will be in danger of failing.

It should be said that the Party and government leadership organs in Guangdong have already done a lot of work in this area; many places have achieved significant results. In Dongguan County, where the spring plowing production had already reached a high tide, there were 153 backward cooperatives at one point. After a period of effort, nearly 100 cooperatives have improved their situation, with some even surpassing the original advanced cooperatives. The proportion of backward areas in the province has decreased from 20% to 25% a month ago to the current 10% to 15%.

The formation of these backward villages and cooperatives has various causes, but one of the most common and important is the weakness of leadership and the lack of assistance from leading organs. In particular, many of those villages and cooperatives that have long been labeled "Category Three Cooperatives" (backward cooperatives) or "dead corners" are located in remote mountainous areas, far from leading organs, or have poor production conditions and a weak working foundation. For a long time, the attention and resources of the leadership have been concentrated in areas with better conditions, which are considered easier to "create typical examples" and "play a demonstration role," while little attention has been paid to these areas that need more help. Many rural workers, instead of first examining their own work, simply call these places "backward" or "dead corners," as if these places are inherently unable to accept socialism and do a good job. On this point, the Zhanjiang Prefectural Committee has made a very appropriate analysis. They believe that some workers have developed a superstitious view of backward villages and cooperatives; to solve the problem, it is necessary to first break this superstitious view and earnestly strengthen leadership in these villages and cooperatives. Yangjiang County provides such an example: the Kunbei Township (formed by the merger of three small townships) in this county has long been regarded as a backward area, lagging behind in all aspects of work. This time, the county party committee was determined to change the situation in this area and sent a deputy director of the county's cooperation department to serve as the party secretary of the township. He found that the main reason for the past backwardness was that the original district committee leading the township had long been laissez-faire in its work, and the political and leadership skills of many cooperative cadres in the township had never been improved. The members generally reported that they had never heard of the policy of cooperation in the past and knew nothing about it. In this situation, although the cooperatives in the township generally increased production last year, the spring plowing campaign could not be launched, and the atmosphere of withdrawing from the cooperative was very strong. After publicizing the Party Central Committee's call for striving for a bumper harvest this year and solving some specific problems, the appearance of the township completely changed, breaking the superstition that "backward townships are always backward."

Strengthening leadership and assistance is the key to changing the situation in backward villages and cooperatives. Many facts in the province have fully demonstrated this. At the beginning of the spring plowing season, Tunchang County on Hainan Island sent a group of cadres with long-term rural work experience, headed by the county party secretary, to help local cadres work in the mainland and Changyi townships, where there are many mountains and roads are long, and there are many problems. These places, which have always been lagging behind in the past, are not lagging behind at all in this spring plowing season, and the cooperatives are becoming more and more consolidated. Currently, the 1,000 cadres recently sent to the countryside in Shunde County are all working in backward cooperatives. Xinhui County has added more than 100 of its most capable cadres from 13 districts to work in backward villages and cooperatives.

Cadres in various places have also paid attention to solving different problems according to different situations. For example, the reason for the low production morale of the Dongfang Cooperative in Shatou Township, Dongguan County, was that it suffered a disaster last year and reduced production, and the members' thoughts were confused, and some members had difficulties in life. The staff of this cooperative guided the members to understand the reasons for the production reduction last year, distinguish right from wrong, and recognize the superiority that the production reduction cooperative still showed; at the same time, they organized members with production difficulties to engage in sideline production and provided loans to members who were currently short of money and food for emergency relief. In this way, the morale of the whole cooperative was high, and the attendance rate of members reached more than 90%. The reason for the backwardness of the First Cooperative in Chigang Township in the county was that the problem of the valuation of cattle and farm implements after the merger and upgrade of the cooperative last year had not been resolved, and the cultivated areas had not been divided. This cooperative re-processed the valuation problem of cattle and farm implements, implemented the mutual benefit policy, and divided the cultivated areas, and promoted the "three guarantees" system, and the situation quickly improved. The work of changing backward production teams is the same as that of changing backward cooperatives. The cooperative has appointed the main cadres to strengthen their assistance to these teams, or has transferred labor and farm implements from the teams that have completed the work faster to support them. Some well-run cooperatives have already paid attention to mobilizing the work of "backward members." For example, the Qunsheng Cooperative in Zhongshan County, while helping four backward teams to improve their work, also assigned cadres to enthusiastically help and educate the members who attended less in each team by calculating attendance and calculating income, etc., and within seven days, the whole cooperative added more than 80 people to invest in spring plowing production.

At present, some cadres in some places still have a slack mood when production progresses quickly and achieves great results, and do not see that there are still some backward cooperatives and teams in their local towns that need to strengthen leadership, which is an obstacle to doing a better job in the local spring plowing production work.

### 到落后乡去

　　到落后乡去
　　本报记者  林里  向青
    编者按  要把春耕生产工作全面地做好，不只是在少数先进的农业社里做好，农业的大丰收才有可靠的保证。可是，领导力量有限，又不能平均地分散地使用。怎么办？许多地方的经验证明：要“抓两头”——抓先进的，也抓落后的。落后社是问题较多的地方，加强对落后社的领导，可以取得很多解决问题的经验。广东省许多地方特别注意加强对落后乡、社的领导，已经有了明显的效果。应当注意的是：一、不可把先进社、落后社孤立起来对待，而要把从先进社、落后社取得的经验及时地向全面推广。二、不可把先进社、落后社看成固定不变的，而要在运动中根据具体情况的变化比较灵活地运用领导力量。
    广东省的春耕运动每天都有新的发展。但是，在轰轰烈烈的气氛里，各地却也有或多或少的乡、社，社员情绪仍然不高，生产冷冷清清。怎样努力，改变春耕中的落后乡、社的情况，是当前急需解决的问题之一。
    这些在生产运动中落后了的乡、社，在全省来说，估计约在10％到15％左右。有的农业社，即使全社的工作搞得很红火，也有一些生产队或一部分社员没有行动起来或者工作不好。例如番禺县前些时作过统计：全县落后的社是15％，而落后的生产队却有20％。
    季节是愈来愈紧迫了！这些乡、社里，隐伏着贻误农时、掉荒田地、耕作粗糙的危机。很明显，目前如果不抓紧，全省争取1957年大丰收的增产计划就会受到影响，争取90％的社增产、90％的社员增收的要求，就会有落空的危险。
    应该说：广东党政领导机关，在这方面已经做了不少工作；有好些地方还取得了不小成绩。春耕生产早就形成高潮的东莞县，那时全县就有一百五十三个落后社；经过一段时间的努力，已有近百个社改变了情况，其中有的甚至赶过了原来的先进社。全省的落后面已经从一个月前的20％到25％降为现在的10％到15％。
    这些落后乡、社的形成，尽管有着各种不同的原因，但其中较为普遍、也是最重要的一个，就是领导力量薄弱而又缺乏领导机关的帮助。特别是那些长期地被称为“三类社”（落后社）、“死角”的乡、社，有许多是处于边远山区、远离领导机关的，或者是生产条件、工作基础较差的。领导的注意和力量的使用，长时期以来都集中在一些条件较好、认为易于“创造典型”、易于起“示范作用”的地方，对这些更需要帮助的地方就很少注意。许多农村工作人员，不首先从自己的工作来检查，却一味把这些地方称为“落后”、“死角”，似乎这些地方天生的难以接受社会主义，难以搞好工作。在这一点上，湛江地委有过很恰当的分析。他们认为：有些工作人员对落后乡、社已形成一种迷信观念了；要解决问题，首先就要打破这种迷信观念，认真地对这些乡、社加强领导。阳江县在这方面就提供了这样一个范例：这个县的篢北乡（由三个小乡并成），长期被看作落后的地区，在任何工作中都被落在后面。这次，县委决心改变这地方的状况，派了一个县委合作部副部长前去担任这个乡的党委书记。他发现过去落后的原因，主要是原来领导该乡的区委长期对这个乡的工作放任自流，这个乡的许多社干部政治水平领导水平长期无从提高。社员们普遍反映：过去从未听过合作化的政策，什么都不知道。在这种情况下，虽然去年这个乡的社普遍增产，但春耕运动搞不起来，闹退社的空气却很浓厚。宣传了党中央争取今年大丰收的号召，解决了一些具体问题以后，这个乡的面貌就完全改观了，破除了“落后乡永远落后”的迷信。
    加强领导和帮助，是改变落后乡、社状况的关键。在全省已有许多事实充分说明这一点。海南岛屯昌县，在春耕开始的时候，就派了以县委书记为首的一批有长期农村工作经验的干部，到山多路远、问题最多的大陆、长圯等乡去帮助当地干部工作。这些历年来工作一直落后的地方，在这次春耕中一点也不落后了，合作社也越发巩固了。现在，顺德县最近下乡的一千名干部，都到落后社去工作。新会县十三个区加派了能力最强的干部一百多人到落后乡社工作。
    各地干部也注意了根据不同情况解决不同问题。例如东莞县沙头乡东坊社生产情绪不高的原因是去年受灾减产，社员思想混乱，部分社员生活困难。这个社的工作人员就引导社员认识去年减产的原因，分清是非，认识减产社仍然显示了的优越性；同时，组织生产困难的社员进行副业生产，并贷款给目前就缺钱缺粮的社员救急。这样，全社情绪都高涨了，社员出勤率达到90％以上。该县赤岗乡第一社落后的原因是去年并社升级后耕牛农具折价入社问题始终没有处理，耕作区也没划分。这个社重新处理了耕牛农具的折价问题，贯彻执行互利政策，并划好了耕作区，推行“三包”制度，情况很快就好转了。改变落后生产队的工作，跟改变落后社的做法一样。社里委派了主要干部加强对这些队的帮助，或者是从工作完成较快的队抽调劳动力和农具来支援。有些搞得好的社，已经注意发动“落后社员”的工作了。如中山县的群胜社，在帮助四个落后队改进了工作的同时，还由干部分工对各队少出勤的社员用算出勤算收入等办法进行热心的帮助教育，七天内全社就增加了八十多个人投入春耕生产。
    目前，仍有一些地方的干部，在生产进展较快取得较大成绩的时候，有了松劲情绪，而没有看到本地本乡还有一些落后社、队需要加强领导，这是把当地的春耕生产工作做得更好的一个障碍。
