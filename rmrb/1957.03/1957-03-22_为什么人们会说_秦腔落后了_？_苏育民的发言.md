I warmly support Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Chen's reports. I would like to share my personal opinions on the situation of opera work in Shaanxi Province.

Our country achieved great victories in the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce in 1956, and socialist industrial construction also achieved great success. Due to the rapid growth of the urban population, the increase in wages for cadres and workers, especially the bumper harvests in both seasons in Shaanxi last year after agricultural cooperativization, the income of farmers generally increased. The improvement of the material lives of the broad masses has profoundly stimulated their urgent demands for cultural life, which in turn has stimulated the activities of the national operas that they love to hear and see. At the same time, the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" has powerfully promoted the development of science, culture, and art. In addition, since the Ministry of Culture's repertoire conference last year, a large number of opera heritages that had been restricted by "rigid rules" have been successively excavated and staged, changing the situation of scarce opera programs. At the same time, from May of last year, the state exempted entertainment tax for two years. As a result, since the second half of last year, a new prosperous atmosphere has emerged in the opera industry. Whether it is peak season or off-season, every theater is crowded with audiences. In Xi'an, most of the audience are farmers from nearby villages, old women, old men, girls, and young men who have not entered the city for many years. They come to the city with the joy of the harvest to see the face of the motherland's construction, and also to watch several opera programs and famous actors that they have been wanting to see for many years. They line up outside the theater before dawn to wait to buy tickets, and they are very disappointed when there are no more tickets to sell to them. Most of the opera actors in Northwest China come from rural areas. Among the audiences from rural areas, there are their own parents or relatives. The actors deeply understand the feelings of the people from rural areas, and from that feeling, they realize the tremendous changes in the motherland and the great significance of the cause they are engaged in, and they are willing to dedicate more efforts to it. Since the second half of last year, the changes in the operating conditions of the opera troupes have been very obvious. In Xi'an alone, the Shangyou Society's Qin腔 opera troupe's income was more than 51,000 yuan in the first half of last year, and increased to more than 68,000 yuan in the second half of the year; the Sanyi Society's income from 58 performances in February last year was only more than 8,600 yuan, while the income from 34 performances since the Spring Festival in February this year reached more than 13,000 yuan. The operating income of other Yuju and Yueju operas has also generally increased.

With the improvement of operating conditions, the wages of actors and staff of various opera troupes have been increased. The private Shangyou Society increased by an average of 35%, and other opera troupes and opera genres have also had considerable increases. The improvement of life has further stimulated the new prosperous atmosphere of the opera industry and encouraged the enthusiasm of actors and staff. At the same time, the opera troupes also have the financial strength to add costumes and equipment, and engage in observation and research to improve artistic quality. Therefore, regardless of social conditions or the conditions of the opera industry itself, opera work should develop more rapidly than in the past.

Shaanxi's opera work—mainly Qin腔—has achieved certain results in the past few years under the guidance of the Party and Chairman Mao's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new." And due to the participation in the National Opera Performance in 1952 and the holding of the Shaanxi Provincial Opera Performance in 1956, the artistic quality has also improved a lot; but according to the original achievements of Qin腔 and its existing strength, the current situation of opera work in Shaanxi Province is very unsatisfactory.

Two Reasons Why Qin腔 Has Not Been Better Developed

Qin腔 is one of the older and more excellent opera genres in China. For hundreds of years, it has been loved by people all over the country, especially in Shaanxi, Gansu, and other parts of Northwest China. It has also had a certain impact on the development of various opera genres in the country. Qin腔 is also one of the opera genres that directly served the revolution earlier. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, in the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the broad masses of the old revolutionary base areas, the heroic and arduous Liberation Army soldiers, and revolutionary cadres were very familiar with it. The vast majority of comrades who lived in Yan'an have seen Qin腔. At that time, Qin腔 received various care and great attention from the responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee. Qin腔 has always had a large number of artists and inexhaustible heritage. Now, there are 61 opera troupes in Shaanxi Province (50 private opera troupes and 11 state-owned opera troupes), 4,500 artists, and according to incomplete statistics, there are more than 2,100 programs. However, in recent years, people have often heard people say: "Qin腔 is backward!" This issue became the center of the Xi'an opera community's depression and the topic of discussion among people from all walks of life who love Qin腔 last year, and some people have already issued a call to "save Qin腔." My colleagues and I really feel that this cannot go on. In my personal, one-sided, and superficial view, the problem lies in:

	(1) The issue of cooperation between artists and cadres. Artists have been living on the stage for many years, and naturally accepted a set of heritage, but they lack the necessary knowledge in politics and culture. Although they perform operas, they often know how to do it, but not why. After liberation, cadre comrades with political and cultural accomplishment joined the opera work, and they made up for the original shortcomings of the artists, which should be satisfactory. The problem also arises here. Cadre comrades have culture and theory, but they do not have a thorough understanding of the art of Qin腔 opera, so in actual work, they have not been able to unite the artists well and cautiously inherit the heritage of national art. Also, because many cadres are in responsible positions, their set of ideas often replaces the artists' set of ideas. This is caused by a lack of cooperation and a lack of mutual respect, which is not in line with the Party's spirit of uniting and transforming artists.

	Shaanxi Province's two large state-owned opera troupes, the Provincial Opera Theater and the Yisushe, are extremely obvious in this issue. They rarely perform traditional Qin腔 programs. The Opera Theater only performs scripts that it has created and adapted, and rarely selects and performs even traditional excerpted operas, so it often lacks programs to perform. The Yisushe puts down hundreds of operas from the past and does not perform them, and often looks for scripts from outside to perform. This makes the artists unable to perform their own signature programs for a long time, have no opportunity to learn new programs, and cannot serve as directors, leaving them with no place to use their talents. Like the old gentleman Liu Yuzhong, who won the first prize for actors in the National Opera Performance, he has insight and ability. We think that he is the only remaining talent among Qin腔 Lao Sheng (old male role) actors, but he cannot get a role in the operas and has no opportunity to direct. He cannot even teach primary school students. He is suffering all day long because his art cannot be passed down. There is also a famous Qin腔 actor who left the opera troupe without saying goodbye because of this kind of suffering. In terms of training new actors, due to the reasons mentioned earlier, the singing, dialogue, and movements in the performed operas lack the traditional style of Qin腔, so the masses do not welcome them. The private opera troupes are responsible by the artists. Although they have maintained the Qin腔 style and excavated a lot of heritage, they have not been improved for a long time due to the limited level, and they have paid more attention to the income of the enterprise in selecting programs, which is not serious and responsible enough. The result of this is that the thoughts of cadres and artists are not well united, there is a lack of close cooperation in work, the societies are independent of each other and despise each other, which seriously affects the excavation of heritage and the improvement and development of the opera industry.

	(2) Lack of initiative in leadership and weak mass viewpoint. After the repertoire conference, the relevant leading departments of the province and city did not specifically organize forces to carry out excavation work in a planned way, which resulted in a certain degree of laissez-faire and waste of manpower. The chaotic phenomenon pointed out by the People's Daily has not yet been specifically arranged. In April last year, the responsible comrade of the Provincial Party Committee raised the issue regarding the situation of Qin腔 and studied it with everyone, made a report and put forward many specific measures. However, like "overall planning," "redeploying forces," and "unified leadership and concentrated forces," etc., due to the lack of bold and resolute practices of the relevant departments, it has been almost a year now. Although some arrangements have also been made, they are only trivial issues and cannot fundamentally reverse it from the ideological and organizational aspects. Last year, Changchun Film Studio decided to shoot a Qin腔 film in October, which was originally a happy event for the Shaanxi opera community and Qin腔 lovers. However, due to the leadership's insistence on its own opinions in terms of script revision, performance art, and actor selection, and its failure to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, everyone spent more than four months and invested a lot of effort, but it is still impossible to carry out the filming work. This style of leadership, although caused by insufficient understanding of the art of Qin腔, has objectively formed a sectarian tendency to be divorced from the masses.

	We also feel that the central leading opera work department's direct intervention and in-depth actual leadership in Shaanxi opera work is too insufficient. As far as I am concerned, I feel that in addition to general calls, there has been no in-depth understanding and inspection. Last year, when Shaanxi Province held a performance, two responsible comrades were sent from Beijing to attend and guide, but they were just two viewers who "arrived late and left early." We cannot hope that Director Tian Han will personally attend the Shaanxi performance like he did for other performances, but we hope that he will pay attention to Qin腔 and other opera genres in Shaanxi, such as Han Tiao Erhuang and Mei Hu. Due to the lack of attention from the central leading opera department, the Shaanxi Provincial Opera Theater, which has three troupes, does not even have a theater until now. Some committee comrades have been to Xi'an to understand this situation. These troupes have been performing in a shed in a small alley. The stage is small and broken, the environment is dirty and chaotic, and the shed does not shelter from wind and rain. It lacks the most basic equipment conditions to teach them to play a demonstration role. Han Tiao Erhuang is an ancient opera genre with great research value. It has developed very little in recent years, and many famous artists like Zhang Qinghong have not been valued until now. I remember when Mr. Cheng Yanqiu came to Xi'an in 1950, he highly evaluated the operas of Han Tiao Erhuang old artists such as Zhao Anzi, and believed that many lost programs in Peking Opera were still preserved in Han Tiao Erhuang. There is also the Mei Hu opera genre. There is only one troupe in Xi'an (the third troupe of the Provincial Opera Theater). Strangely, there is not a single classical program. In the new programs, due to the "creation" in the tunes and the "strengthening" in the instruments, many original styles are gone. In the years after the National Performance, almost all opera genres have made movies and made reports in Beijing, but only Qin腔 is still coldly shrinking in a corner. Last year, after the Shaanxi Provincial Performance, Shaanxi Province decided to make a report in Beijing, but the relevant parties in the central government raised difficulties and politely refused. Are these comrades who lead opera work not worried or want to ask about it if they do not see Qin腔 and do not understand the situation of Shaanxi opera? Of course, the local area should first do a good job in Qin腔, but it is also inseparable from the equal care and support from the higher authorities. We believe that the central leading opera work department's lack of attention to and understanding of Qin腔 is also one of the reasons why Qin腔 has not made much progress.

	In addition, I also feel that the central government's policy of "building the country with diligence and thrift... running all undertakings with diligence and thrift" has not aroused widespread and sufficient attention in our opera community. Therefore, responding to the Party's call for increasing production and practicing economy, and opposing extravagance and waste, is still a very important task for us at present. In big cities, the ideological situation of some opera troupes emphasizing ostentation and extravagance is serious. They want training grounds, rehearsal rooms, and complete equipment, and they want everything. They ask the state for money at every turn. When performing an opera, they do not pay enough attention to quality, but they pay attention to magnificent scenery design, and the costumes and props must be brand new, which costs a lot. In order to "make a splash," individual state-owned opera troupes can only produce a new opera in half a year or even a year. The programs are scarce, the performances are few, and they cannot support themselves. Instead, the state has to subsidize tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of yuan every year, which seriously wastes manpower and financial resources. This situation must be taken seriously and resolutely corrected.

Opinions on Improving Opera Work

Now, I would like to put forward some opinions on opera work from my personal point of view:

	(1) In order to build a socialist motherland, artists are willing to dedicate all their strength without reservation under the leadership of the Party and the government. Artists welcome cooperation with new literary and art workers, but in cooperation, new literary and art workers should be required to value the labor of artists. At the same time, I hope that the Party and the government will put the artists who can take on leadership work in appropriate positions and give them the necessary authority from the administrative to the business aspects. Not counting the private opera troupes in Shaanxi Province, in the past, none of the four presidents and three deputy heads of the three troupes under the Opera Theater were artists, and none of the presidents and deputy presidents of the Yisushe were artists. Although these leading comrades have a considerable level in theory and culture, wouldn't it be better to unite the old artists and work together to move forward with everyone's wisdom and efforts? We believe that doing so will further embody the cooperation between cadres and artists and will be conducive to excavating heritage and promoting the progress of the opera industry.

	(2) Launch academic competitions. In today's era, knowledge is power. To do a good job, you must have rich knowledge. In addition to a set of skills on the stage, artists are relatively lacking in knowledge and should catch up and study hard. However, in the opera work in Shaanxi Province, many people who engage in opera and lead opera lack enthusiasm and a spirit of research in the face of a large amount of heritage. Chinese opera is different from Western opera, and Qin腔 is different from other opera genres. Absorbing others does not mean replacing yourself. Only those who do not understand themselves will think that everything about others is good, and even such people may not be able to correctly recognize the strengths of others. In Qin腔 work, it seems that there is a trend that few people learn from others and few people summarize their own experiences. The atmosphere of academic discussion is very weak. As a result, people who engage in classical scripts lack the traditional atmosphere in terms of character and lines; while directors and actors do not master the unique performance techniques of Chinese opera and look down on traditional art; people who engage in music pull a prelude in three days and think it is enough. They think that Chinese opera music is nothing, and they are very proud. They lack the spirit of hard work and learning, and are satisfied with a smattering of knowledge. Treating heritage and art in such an unserious way will inevitably produce rude results. We are very rare of the "Opera Research" quarterly of the Chinese Academy of Opera, and we hope that the leaders of Shaanxi opera will also learn this method. At the same time, we hope that other newspapers and periodicals will also go deeper into organizing academic discussions on opera issues, make the atmosphere of academic research strong, and step by step improve the art of opera under the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." Like the Soviet Union at the beginning, we hope that some red experts will continue to emerge among the cadres. In this way, the boundaries between artists and cadres will disappear, and the opera industry will be more prosperous.

	(3) Unified leadership and concentrated forces. Generally speaking, the performance art of Qin腔 after the Revolution of 1911 is difficult to satisfy people. To excavate performance art, we must excavate from artists, especially old artists. Most of the old Qin腔 artists are over 60 or 70 years old, and many of them have excellent artistic achievements. However, due to their old age and weakness and low level of education, they cannot engage in performance activities, nor can they use words to record their artistic experience; also, because they have their own strengths and different styles, it is difficult to systematically organize their artistic achievements if they are scattered in various places. Therefore, I propose that an old artists' home should be established in Xi'an, or that old artists should be concentrated in a theater or a troupe, and young artists and literary and art workers should be organized to learn from them together and inherit the heritage. On this issue, time is everything. If we relax our learning from old artists, it will cause irreparable losses to us.

My overall desire is for work. Therefore, the language and understanding of the issues may not all be correct or appropriate, but in order to live up to the teachings and expectations of the Party and the people, I am willing to speak my mind and hope to get criticism and guidance to further improve our opera work.

### 为什么人们会说“秦腔落后了”？　苏育民的发言

专栏：

　　为什么人们会说“秦腔落后了”？
　　苏育民的发言
    我热烈拥护周总理、陈副主席的报告。并就陕西省戏曲工作中的一些情况，谈谈我个人的意见。
    我们国家在1956年取得了对农业、手工业和对资本主义工商业社会主义改造的伟大胜利，社会主义工业建设也获得巨大的成就。因为城市人口的迅速增长，干部工人工资的提高，尤其是陕西地区去年在农业合作化以后两季大丰收，农民普遍的增加了收入。广大群众的物质生活提高以后对文化生活的迫切要求，深刻的刺激了他们所喜闻乐见的民族戏曲的活跃。同时党提出的“百家争鸣，百花齐放”的方针，极其有力的推动了科学、文化艺术的发展。另外从去年文化部剧目会议以来，在“清规戒律”限制下的大量戏曲遗产，陆续被挖掘上演，改变了戏曲节目贫乏的状况。同时从去年5月份起，国家免征娱乐税两年。于是自去年下半年以来，戏曲事业出现了新的繁荣气象。不论旺季或淡季，家家剧院都挤满了观众。在西安，大多数观众是从远近乡村来的农民兄弟，多年不进城的老太婆、老大爷、姑娘们和小伙子。他们都带着丰收的喜悦进城来看一看祖国建设的面貌，同时还要看几次积年累月存心要看的戏曲节目和闻名的演员。他们天不明就在剧院门外排起队来等着买票，当没有票再卖给他们的时候，就非常遗憾。西北各地的戏曲演员多半出身于农村，从农村来的观众中间，就有自己的父母或亲属，演员们切身的懂得农村来的人的心情，并且从那种心情中体会出祖国日新月异的变化，和自己从事的事业的重大意义，愿意为它献出更多的力量。去年下半年以来，各剧团营业情况的变化是非常显明的。西安一地的秦腔剧团，尚友社去年上半年收入五万一千余元，下半年增长到六万八千多元；三意社去年2月份旺季五十八场戏的收入只有八千六百多元，而今年2月份从春节以来三十四场戏的收入即达一万三千余元。其他豫剧、越剧的营业收入也都普遍增加。
    营业情况的好转，各剧团演员职工的工资都得到提高。民营的尚友社平均提高了35％，其他剧团、剧种也都有相当的提高。生活的改善进一步刺激了戏曲事业新的繁荣气象，鼓舞了演员和职工的积极性。同时剧团也在经济上有力量添置服装、设备、从事观摩研究提高艺术质量。所以不论社会条件或戏曲事业本身的条件，戏曲工作都应该比已往更为迅速的向前发展。
    陕西的戏曲工作——主要的是秦腔，解放几年来在党和毛主席“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针指导之下，曾经取得一定成绩。并由于1952年参加了全国戏曲会演，1956年举办了陕西省戏曲会演，在艺术质量上也有不少提高；但是按秦腔原有的成就和它现有的力量，陕西省戏曲工作的现状，都是非常令人不能满意的。
  秦腔没有得到更好发展的两个原因
    秦腔在我国是比较古老的优秀剧种之一，几百年来受到全国各地特别是陕、甘西北各地人民的喜爱。对于全国各剧种的发展也起过一定的影响。秦腔又是直接为革命服务较早的剧种之一，当在抗日战争和解放战争时期，在革命圣地延安和陕甘宁边区，老根据地广大人民，英勇艰苦的解放军战士和革命干部对它很熟悉。曾经在延安生活过的同志们绝大多数看过秦腔，那时候秦腔受到党中央负责同志多方的关怀和极大的重视。秦腔一直拥有大量的艺人和挖掘不尽的遗产，现在陕西省有六十一个剧团（民间剧团五十个、国营剧团十一个），四千五百多艺人，据不完全的统计有二千一百多个节目。但是近年以来经常不断听见人说：“秦腔落后了！”这个问题去年一年成为西安戏剧界的苦闷和各界爱好秦腔人士谈论的中心，并且已经有人发出“挽救秦腔”的呼声，我和我的同事们实在觉得不能这样下去。我个人片面的肤浅的看法，以为问题在于：
      （一）艺人和干部的合作问题。艺人多年来一直生活在舞台上，自然而然的接受了一套遗产，而在政治、文化方面缺乏必要的知识，虽然演戏，但是往往知其然而不知其所以然。解放以后有政治修养和文化修养的干部同志参加了戏曲工作，艺人原来不足的方面，他们给补上了，这应该是满意的。问题也就发生在这里，干部同志有文化、有理论，但是对秦腔这个戏曲艺术了解得并不透澈，因而在实际工作中就未能很好地团结艺人和谨慎地继承民族艺术的遗产。又由于很多干部站在负责岗位上，所以他们的一套就经常代替了艺人的一套。这是一种缺乏合作、缺乏互相尊重的思想所致，是和党的团结艺人、改造艺人的精神不相符合的。
    陕西省两个大的国营剧团，省戏曲剧院和易俗社，在这个问题上表现得极为明显，他们排演的节目很少有秦腔传统节目。戏曲剧院排演的仅是自己创作和改编的剧本，连些传统折戏都很少选排，因之经常缺乏上演节目；易俗社把过去的几百本戏放下不演，经常找外边的本子来演。这样就使艺人长期不能演出自己拿手的节目，没机会学新的节目，又不能担任导演，弄得英雄无用武之地。像曾获得全国会演演员一等奖的刘毓中老先生，有见地、有本领，在秦腔老生人才中我们认为是硕果仅存，但是演戏插不上，导演没机会，甚至想教小学生也不可能，整天为自己的艺术不能传下去而苦闷。还有一位秦腔名演员也因这种苦闷不告而离开剧团。在训练新演员方面，由于前边所说的那样原因，演出戏来唱、白、动作，缺乏秦腔传统风格，因而群众不欢迎。民营剧团由艺人负责，虽然保持了秦腔风格，挖掘了不少遗产，但是由于水平所限长期得不到提高，而且在选择节目上多注意了企业收入，不够严肃负责。这样作的结果是干部和艺人的思想上团结不好，工作上缺乏密切合作，社与社之间各立门户、互相轻视，严重的影响了遗产的发掘与戏剧事业的提高和发展。
    （二）领导上缺乏主动、群众观点不强。剧目会议以后，省市有关领导部门在挖掘工作上，没有具体组织力量有计划的进行，因而产生了一定程度的放任自流，浪费人力，如人民日报曾经指出的混乱现象，直到现在还未见具体安排。去年4月省委负责同志，针对秦腔情况提出问题和大家研究，作了报告并且提出许多具体措施。但是像“全面规划”“重新部署力量”“统一领导、集中力量”等等，因有关部门缺乏大刀阔斧的作法，到现在将近一年，虽然也作了一些安排，但只是枝节问题，不能从根本上从思想和组织上扭转。去年长春电影制片厂决定在10月间拍摄一部秦腔影片，这本来是陕西戏曲界和秦腔爱好者的一件喜事。但是由于领导上在剧本修改、表演艺术、演员选择等方面坚持己见，不能虚心地听取群众的意见，结果大家花费了四个多月的时间，投了很大的力量，直到现在还不能进行拍摄工作。领导上这种作风，虽然是由于对秦腔艺术了解不足所致，但是在客观上却形成脱离群众的宗派主义倾向。
    我们还感到中央领导戏曲的工作部门，对陕西戏曲工作的直接过问、深入实际的领导是太不够了。在我就感觉到除一般的号召外，没有深入了解和检查过。去年陕西省会演时，从北京派了两位负责同志出席指导，但是这只是“迟到早退”的二位观众。我们不能希望田汉局长也像对别处会演一样的亲自出席陕西会演，但是我们希望在思想上重视一下秦腔和陕西的其他剧种像汉调二黄、郿鄠等。由于中央领导戏曲的部门重视不够，像陕西省戏曲剧院拥有三个团，直到现在还没有一个剧场，有些委员同志曾到过西安了解这种情况，这些剧团一直在一个小巷子内的席棚下演出，舞台又小又坏，环境又脏又乱，席棚不蔽风雨，要教他们起一些示范作用是缺乏起码的设备条件的。汉调二黄是很有研究价值的一个古老剧种，这几年来发展很小，许多名艺人像张庆宏等至今尚不为人重视。记得程砚秋先生1950年来西安的时候，看了汉调二黄老艺人赵安子等人的戏评价很高，认为京剧中很多失传的节目，尚保留在汉调二黄中。还有郿鄠剧种，在西安只有一个剧团（省戏曲剧院三团），奇怪的是没有一个古典节目，在新节目中由于腔调上的“创造”，乐器上的“加强”，很多原有风格都不见了。全国会演后的几年中，各剧种差不多都拍了电影，到北京作了汇报演出，只有秦腔依然冷落的缩在一角。去年陕西省会演后，陕西省决定到北京汇报演出一次，但是中央的有关方面却提出困难，婉言拒绝了。难道这些领导戏曲工作的同志不见秦腔不了解陕西戏曲情况都不着急，都不想过问吗？当然地方上首先应该把秦腔搞好，但是也离不开上级一视同仁的关怀和支持。我们认为中央领导戏曲工作部门对秦腔重视不足、了解不够，也是秦腔进步不大的原因之一。
    此外，我还感觉到中央提出的“勤俭建国……勤俭办一切事业”的方针在我们戏剧界尚未引起普遍的和足够的重视，因此，响应党的增产节约号召，反对铺张浪费，仍然是我们目前一项十分重要的任务。在大城市有些剧团讲排场讲阔气的思想情况是严重的，要练功场、彩排室，要设备齐全，应有尽有。动不动就伸手向国家要钱，演出一本戏，对质量重视不够，布景设计却讲究富丽堂皇，服装道具必须焕然一新，花的代价很高。个别国营剧团为了“一鸣惊人”，半年甚至一年才能排出一个新剧，节目贫乏，演出很少，不能自给，反而每年要国家补贴数万甚至数十万元，严重地造成了人力、财力的浪费。这种情况，是必须引起严重注意和切实加以纠正的。
      改进戏曲工作的意见
    现在，我想就我个人的看法，对戏曲工作方面，提出一些意见：
    （一）为建设社会主义的祖国，艺人是愿意在党和政府的领导下毫不保留的献出自己所有的力量。艺人欢迎与新文艺工作者合作，但是在合作上，应该要求新文艺工作者重视艺人的劳动。同时希望党和政府把能够担当领导工作的艺人摆在适当的岗位上，给他们从行政上到业务上应有的职权。陕西省民营剧团不算，过去戏曲剧院及所属三个团，四位院长和三个团的正副团长没有一个艺人，易俗社的正副社长也没有一个艺人，这些领导同志在理论上文化上虽有相当的水平，但是把老艺人团结起来，大家群策群力一同前进不更好吗？我们认为这样做将进一步的体现干部和艺人的合作，有利于发掘遗产和推动戏曲事业的前进。
    （二）展开学术竞赛。在今天这样的时代中知识就是力量，要做好工作必须有丰富的知识。艺人们除了舞台上的一套外，知识是比较缺乏的，应该急起直追努力学习。但是在陕西省的戏曲工作中，很多搞戏曲的、搞戏曲领导的都在大量的遗产面前缺乏热情和钻研精神。中国戏剧和西洋戏剧不一样，秦腔又和别的剧种不一样，吸收别人的不等于代替自己，只有不了解自己的人才会觉得别人一切都好，而且这样的人对别人的长处也未必能认识正确。在秦腔工作中好像有一种风气，很少学习别人的也很少总结自己的，学术上探讨的空气非常淡薄。结果搞古典剧本的人从人物性格到台词上缺乏传统气息；而导演和演员，不掌握中国戏曲特有的表现手法，看不起传统艺术；搞音乐的人三天拉会了一个过门认为已经够了，中国戏曲音乐没啥了，非常骄傲，缺乏艰苦致学精神，满足于一知半解，这样不严肃的对待遗产对待艺术，必然产生粗暴的结果。我们十分稀罕中国戏曲研究院的“戏曲研究”季刊，希望陕西戏曲领导也学习这种办法。同时希望其他报刊也多深入组织戏曲问题的学术讨论，把学术研究空气浓厚起来，在“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针下把戏曲艺术工作一步步的提高。也像苏联当初一样，希望干部们中不断的出现一些红色专家。这样艺人和干部的界限就会消失，戏曲事业就更会繁荣。
    （三）统一领导、集中力量。秦腔在辛亥以后一般的说表演艺术是很难令人满意的。要挖掘表演艺术必须从艺人，特别是老艺人身上挖掘。秦腔老艺人年纪多在六、七十岁以上，他们有不少是有优秀艺术成就的。但由于他们年老体弱，文化程度不高，既不能进行演出活动，又不能用文字把自己的艺术经验记载下来；又由于他们各有特长，风格不同，如果分散各地，很难把他们的艺术成就系统地整理起来，因此，我提议西安应设立一个老艺人之家，或者把老艺人集中在一个剧院或剧社内，组织青年艺人和文艺工作者，共同向他们学习，把遗产继承下来。在这个问题上，时间就是一切，我们如果一放松向老艺人的学习，就会给我们造成不可弥补的损失。
    我的总的愿望是为了工作。因之在语言上在认识问题上，不一定都正确或恰当，但是为了不负党和人民对我们的教导和期望，我愿意说出心里的话来，希望得到批评指导，把我们的戏曲工作进一步做好。（附图片）
