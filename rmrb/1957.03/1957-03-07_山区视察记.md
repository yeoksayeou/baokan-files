Notes on Inspection in Mountainous Areas
Shi Jiyan, Secretary-General of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

Last winter, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee organized a large-scale inspection and visit to mountainous areas. This inspection adopted a combination of point and area methods, that is, on the one hand, a comprehensive and large-scale inspection of mountainous areas in various places in a mobile manner; on the other hand, people were sent to conduct in-depth investigations and research in key areas. After 40 days of inspection, a total of 58 counties, 120 townships, and 132 agricultural cooperatives in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas were visited. This inspection boosted the confidence of the people and cadres in mountainous areas to build mountainous areas, strengthened the ties between the Party, the government, and the people in mountainous areas, and also strengthened the ties between higher-level leading organs and lower-level leading organs; in particular, it further understood the situation and problems of work in mountainous areas, and further clarified the principles of building mountainous areas and the advanced experiences and lessons in implementing these principles, which is of great significance for improving the leadership of work in mountainous areas.

The Basic Situation of Production Development and People's Livelihood Improvement in Mountainous Areas in Recent Years

The mountainous area of Shanxi Province accounts for more than 70% of the total area of the province, the cultivated land in mountainous areas accounts for more than 40% of the total cultivated land in the province, and the population in mountainous areas accounts for more than 40% of the total agricultural population in the province. Due to the different natural conditions, these mountainous areas are conventionally divided into five regions: southeastern Shanxi, eastern Shanxi, northern Yanbei, northwestern Shanxi, and western Shanxi. The vast majority of these mountainous areas are old revolutionary base areas. Before 1949, social reforms had been gradually implemented, and Chairman Mao's principle of organizing to develop production had been implemented. In the early spring of 1956, advanced agricultural cooperativization was realized.

In recent years, thanks to the hard work of the people, the correct leadership of the Party and the government, and strong economic and technical support, production in mountainous areas has been developing upward: the total grain output and the grain yield per mu have exceeded the level before the Anti-Japanese War, the forest area has increased from 10 million mu in the early days of liberation to 18 million mu now, and large livestock and pigs and sheep have also recovered to pre-war levels, and dried and fresh fruits and local specialties have also developed to varying degrees.

However, the development of production in mountainous areas is quite unbalanced in many aspects due to different natural conditions and work foundations. This is reflected in: grain production and forest development are faster, while animal husbandry and sideline industries are not developing fast enough; the grain yield per mu generally exceeds the pre-war level, but the total grain output in some areas is lower than the pre-war level (due to excessive and drastic reduction of cultivated land area); the production development of some counties, townships, villages, cooperatives, and households is better, and some are worse; some mountains have become rich and valuable mountains, and the wealth of some mountains has not yet been discovered; there is rapid increase in production in one year, and not so rapid increase in production in another year. According to preliminary investigations and research in the seven counties of Dongshan in the Yuci area, in areas with about 25% of the population, agricultural production has exceeded the pre-war level by more than 20%, and forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production have also exceeded or reached the pre-war level, and the actual income of the masses has increased by about 15% compared with the pre-war level. In areas with about 50% of the population, agricultural production exceeds the pre-war level, other production is close to or slightly exceeds the pre-war level, and the actual income of the masses is equal to or slightly exceeds the pre-war level. In areas with about 25% of the population, agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production have not reached the pre-war level, and the actual income of the masses is also less than the pre-war level.

With the development of production in mountainous areas, the lives of the people in mountainous areas have been greatly improved compared with before liberation, and have also been improved to varying degrees on the original basis compared with before the Anti-Japanese War. In 1956, the average net income of farmers in the province was 65 yuan per person (including cotton and wheat producing areas). According to the current living standards of middle-income farmer families in mountainous areas, approximately three to three and a half yuan of living expenses are needed per person per month. Therefore, most farm households in mountainous areas can eat their fill and dress warmly, have a place to live, have pocket money, their children can go to school, and young and middle-aged people can attend winter schools and literacy classes. Some of the more affluent households live even better.

However, among the people in mountainous areas, especially in poor mountainous areas, there are still a small number of households with difficult lives and poor households (including "five guarantees" households). The average annual income of these households is still below 35 yuan per person. Their lives are still quite poor.

The main reasons for the slow development of production in some mountainous areas are as follows: First, the destruction caused by the war during the ten years of the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation was extremely serious. Second, natural disasters such as drought, hail, floods, waterlogging, wind, freezing, and insects are frequent. For example, the Yanbei area suffered four natural disasters in seven years. Many mountainous areas suffered droughts in 1955 that had not been seen since the third year of the Guangxu reign, and in 1956 they suffered floods and waterlogging that had not been seen in a century. Some counties have disasters every year. Third, the Party and the government have serious shortcomings in their leadership of the construction of mountainous areas. The understanding of the imbalance in the development of production in mountainous areas is not enough, the principle of comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in the construction of mountainous areas is not implemented enough, and the deviations in various financial and economic policies related to the construction of mountainous areas are not checked and corrected enough.

The Huge Potential of Production in Mountainous Areas and the Road to Production Development in Mountainous Areas

This inspection once again proves that the vast mountainous areas of Shanxi Province are rich in resources, and there is huge potential for production in mountainous areas. In addition to the rich industrial production resources of coal mines, iron mines, copper mines, sulfur, and gypsum, the potential for agricultural production is also very large. In the soil and stone mountainous areas, loess hilly areas, loess plateau gully areas, and loess hilly gully areas throughout the province, in addition to greatly increasing the grain yield of cultivated land, the conditions for developing animal husbandry and forestry are also very superior. The area that can be afforested in these areas is about 77 million mu, while the existing forest area is only 18 million mu. Currently, there are 5,910,000 sheep in the province (including 42,000 fine-wool sheep). Based on the development of pasture slopes and forage grass in mountainous areas, 16 million sheep can be raised. These areas can also greatly develop dried and fresh fruits, silkworms, and cultivate local specialties and medicinal materials. The major and urgent task before us is how to tap the huge potential of production in mountainous areas and discover the abundant wealth contained in mountainous areas.

Implementing the principle of comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and multiple economies is the road to production development in mountainous areas and a decisive link in improving the lives of the people in mountainous areas. For example, Daobakou Village in Xiyang County was a poor mountain village in the past. Since 1944, thanks to the implementation of the principle of organizing and comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and multiple economies, it has undergone fundamental changes. Now, in addition to repairing all the original 200 mu of cultivated land into terraced fields, more than 60 mu of new terraced fields have been built, and the output has increased by 60% compared with before the Anti-Japanese War. Each household has an average of more than two large livestock, 20 sheep, nearly two pigs, more than ten chickens, and more than one box of bees. The village has 17,500 mu of mature forests and thatch forests, including 400 mu of mature forests and 160,000 mature trees. If the total property of the village is converted into cash, it totals more than 360,000 yuan, with an average of more than 10,000 yuan per household. Some people say that the farmers in Daobakou Village are already wealthy farmers with "millions of fortunes." Although they suffered serious floods and waterlogging last year, which reduced agricultural production by 50%, the average income per household was still 330 yuan, and the average income per person was 74.5 yuan, after deducting agricultural tax burdens and all deductions from agricultural cooperatives. There are many similar examples to Daobakou Village.

We have also seen the tendency to neglect the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and multiple economies. For example, the natural conditions of Xiashitang Township in Yu County are slightly better than those of Daobakou Village, but the grain produced in this township in 1956 was only 260 jin per person on average, and other income averaged less than 40 yuan per household. The main reason is that this township neglects the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and multiple economies.

Generally speaking, grain production is the center and foundation of production in mountainous areas. All different types of mountainous areas should attach importance to grain production in order to solve the problem of food rations, oil, and feed for livestock. However, while attaching importance to grain production, it is necessary to develop animal husbandry, forestry, and other various sideline production in accordance with local conditions. Developing various sideline production can ensure the steady rise of agricultural production; developing forestry can conserve water and soil, and developing animal husbandry not only provides good animal power conditions for agriculture, but also provides sufficient fertilizer conditions for agriculture. These are all guarantees for increased agricultural production.

Implementing the principle of comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and multiple economies is not only the only way for the people in mountainous areas to become rich, but also the only way for mountainous areas to support national construction and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. The current urgent demands of industry for agriculture and cities for rural areas are to supply raw materials for light industry, building materials, and consumer goods, such as timber, hemp, fur, meat, dried and fresh fruits, and local specialties. Some of these products are not only urgently needed in the domestic market, but are also important export goods. Now, the people in mountainous areas have supplied the country with a part of the above-mentioned materials, but it is far from meeting the country's requirements for mountainous areas. In the future, only after comprehensively implementing the principle of comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and multiple economies can the needs of the country be gradually met, can the worker-peasant alliance be further consolidated, and can the lives of the people in mountainous areas be more prosperous.

Several Major Policy Issues in Developing the Mountain Economy

We have examined the implementation of financial and economic policies in some areas. Generally speaking, the country's financial and economic policies are correct, and the implementation is also relatively good. However, due to deviations in the implementation of certain policies, the masses and cadres have many opinions. To sum up, there are the following points: the agricultural tax burden on mountain and plain areas is not balanced enough, and the agricultural tax burden on poor mountainous areas is relatively heavy; some forests that should not have been nationalized have been nationalized, and the forest rights of these forests should be cleared; the management of state-owned forests (even including private scattered trees) is too strict and inflexible, and does not take into account the historical habits of the people in mountainous areas relying on the mountains for a living; the prices of certain agricultural and sideline products are too low; the management of rural markets is too strict and inflexible, and the direction of commodity circulation is determined according to administrative divisions instead of according to the laws of commodity circulation, resulting in losses for the people in mountainous areas; the bourgeois management style of some cadres in the commercial system (including supply and marketing cooperatives) has harmed the interests of the people in mountainous areas.

These opinions are correct. Since the third quarter of 1956, Party and government organs have begun to study solutions. As of now, some have been basically resolved, such as the issue of relaxing rural market management, the issue of adjusting the agricultural tax burden in poor mountainous areas, the issue of adjusting the prices of certain agricultural and sideline products, and the issue of commodity circulation direction; some are being resolved, such as the issue of clearing forest rights and the issue of relaxing the management of state-owned forests; some are being studied to find solutions, such as the issue of balancing the agricultural tax burden on mountain and plain areas and the issue of improving the work style of cadres in the commercial system. Resolutely Strengthen Leadership over Mountain Construction

In the past, the Party and government leading organs at all levels in Shanxi Province generally attached importance to the construction of mountainous areas, but there were also shortcomings or errors of insufficient concern, ineffective measures, inappropriate measures, and generalization. In the future, we must focus on the following points:

First, in order to strengthen the leadership over the construction of mountainous areas, the main responsible comrades of Party committees and governments at all levels should assign people to manage the construction of mountainous areas, and should first summarize the experiences and lessons of the construction of mountainous areas in recent years; the method of sending responsible cadres from provincial-level Party and government leading organs to inspect work in mountainous areas should be adhered to and made into a system. It is necessary to formulate a provincial-level plan for the construction of mountainous areas so that the people in mountainous areas have a clear goal to strive for. In order to strengthen the leadership over the construction of mountainous areas, we should combine this streamlining of institutions and transfer a group of cadres familiar with rural work from the provincial and special-level organs to enrich the county-level organs and townships in mountainous areas.

Second, focus on planning and plan work. In order to implement the principle of comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and multiple economies in a planned and step-by-step manner, each county, each township, and each cooperative must strengthen investigation and research work, do a good job of comprehensive planning from top to bottom and from bottom to top, formulate or revise their own long-term plans, formulate production plans for 1957, and continuously revise them in practice. Based on the experiences and lessons of formulating plans and plans in recent years, especially in 1956, the following principles should be grasped when formulating plans and plans, that is: the principle of combining national requirements, mass needs, and the situation and characteristics of the region, the principle of comprehensively and proportionally developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline industries, handicrafts, and local industries, the principle of being both active and advanced and fully reliable, and the principle of combining the current interests and long-term interests of the masses.

Third, resolutely strengthen the education of Party members and the Party's propaganda and mobilization work. Because most of the mountainous areas in Shanxi Province are old revolutionary base areas, the political awareness of the masses in mountainous areas has always been relatively high. However, with the change of production relations, many new ideological problems have also appeared in the minds of the masses (these ideological problems are ultimately manifestations of the remnants of the ideology of small producers). For example, there is a lack of clear understanding of the main contradictions in rural areas after advanced agricultural cooperativization, and a lack of clear understanding of the direction of building socialist rural areas (mountainous areas). Some people think that the world is peaceful, the revolution has been successful, and there is nothing more to strive for. Some people think that they cannot build socialism without tractors, and there is a passive idea of waiting for tractors. This idea is very harmful to the implementation of the principle of comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and multiple economies. Some people think that tractors cannot go up the mountains and socialism cannot go up the mountains, and they have no confidence in building mountainous areas, so they are not at ease with production and construction in mountainous areas. After the change of production relations, many members cannot correctly handle the relationship between personal interests, collective interests, and national interests. In the past, farmers relied on themselves to solve all their production and living requirements, but now they want to rely on agricultural cooperatives for everything; and the cadres of cooperatives, with the support and surrounded by the members, want to rely on the state to solve everything. Farmers have some misunderstandings about the production and life of workers. Therefore, it is very important to clarify these ideological problems and strengthen propaganda and education work.

    山区视察记
    中共山西省委秘书长　史纪言
    中共山西省委和山西省人民委员会去年冬天组织了一次大规模的山区工作视察和访问。这次视察，采取了点和面相结合的方式，即一方面以流动的方式，到各地山区作全面的大量视察；一方面派人深入重点进行调查研究。经过了四十天的视察，共访问了山区半山区的五十八个县，一百二十个乡，一百三十二个农业合作社。这次视察，鼓舞了山区人民和干部建设山区的信心，密切了党、政府和山区人民的联系，也密切了上级领导机关和下级领导机关的联系；特别是进一步了解了山区工作的情况和问题，进一步明确了建设山区的方针和贯彻执行这一方针中的先进经验和教训，这对于改进对山区工作的领导，具有重大意义。
    几年来山区生产发展和人民生活改善的基本状况
    山西省山区面积占全省总面积的70％以上，山区耕地占全省耕地总面积的40％以上，山区人口占全省农业总人口的40％以上。这些山区由于自然条件的不同，习惯被划分为晋东南、晋东、雁北、晋西北、晋西五个地区。这些山区，绝大部分是革命老根据地，1949年以前，已经逐步实行了社会改革，执行了毛主席的组织起来发展生产的方针，1956年春初，实现了农业的高级合作化。
    几年以来，由于人民群众的辛勤劳动，由于党和政府的正确领导和经济上、技术上的大力支持，山区生产是向上发展的：粮食总产量和粮食的单位亩产量已经超过了抗日战争时期以前的水平，森林面积已经由解放初期的一千万亩发展到现在的一千八百万亩，大牲畜和猪羊，也已恢复到战前水平，干鲜果树和土特产品也有不同程度的发展。
    但是，山区生产的发展，由于自然条件和工作基础的不同，存在着相当大的多方面的不平衡。这表现在：粮食生产和森林发展较快，而畜牧业、副业发展不够快；粮食单位亩产量一般地超过了战前水平，有些地区的粮食总产量却低于战前水平（由于缩小耕地面积过多过猛）；有些县、乡、村、合作社、户的生产发展较好，有些差；有些山已经变成富山宝山，有些山的财富仍然没有发掘出来；有一年增产快，有一年增产不快。根据对榆次专区东山七县的初步调查研究，约有25％左右人口的地区，农业生产超过战前20％以上，林、牧、副业等生产也超过和达到战前水平，群众的实际收入较战前提高了15％左右。约有50％左右人口的地区，农业生产超过战前水平，其它生产接近或略超过战前水平，群众的实际收入和战前相等或略有超过。还有约25％左右人口的地区，农、林、牧、副业等生产未达战前水平，群众的实际收入也不及战前。
    随着山区生产的发展，山区人民的生活较之解放以前已有很大的改善，较之抗日战争时期以前也在原有基础上有不同程度的改善。1956年全省农民纯收入平均每人为六十五元（包括棉麦产区）。而按照目前山区中农家庭的生活水平，大体上每人每月需要生活费三元至三元五角。因此，山区的大多数农户能够吃饱穿暖，有住处，有零花钱，子女可以读书，青壮年能上冬学民校。其中有一部分比较富裕的户生活过得更好一点。
    但是在山区特别是贫瘠山区的人民中，还有一小部分生活困难户和贫困户（包括“五保”户），这些户每个人每年的平均收入，还在三十五元以下。他们的生活，还相当贫苦。
    某些山区生产发展不够快的原因，主要有以下几点：一、在抗日战争和解放战争的十多年中，战争的破坏摧毁极端严重。二、旱、雹、涝、洪、水、风、冻、虫等自然灾害频繁，如雁北区七年中遭了四次自然灾害，不少山区1955年遭了光绪三年以来所没有遭过的旱灾，1956年又遭了百年来所没有遭过的涝灾和洪灾。有的县年年有灾。三、党和政府对山区建设的领导有严重缺点。对山区生产发展的不平衡性认识不够，对于建设山区的农林牧多种经济全面发展的方针贯彻执行不够，对于有关山区建设的各项财政经济政策中所发生的偏差检查和纠正不够。
    山区生产的巨大潜力和山区生产发展的道路
    从这次视察中再次证明，山西省广大山区蕴藏着雄厚的财富，山区生产存在着巨大的潜在力量，除煤矿、铁矿、铜矿、硫磺、石膏等丰富的工业生产的资源外，农业生产的潜在力量也是很大的。在全省各地的土石山区、黄土丘陵区、黄土高原沟壑区和黄土丘陵沟壑区，除了可以大大地提高耕地的粮食产量外，发展畜牧业和林业的条件也是非常优越的。这些地区可以造林的面积约七千七百万亩，而现有森林面积只一千八百万亩。现在全省有羊五百九十一万只（内有细毛羊四万二千只），根据山区牧坡牧草发展的情况，可以养羊一千六百万只。这些地区还可以大大地发展干鲜果树、蚕丝，培育土特产品、药材。摆在我们面前的重大的迫切的任务，是如何把山区生产的巨大的潜在力量发挥出来，把山区蕴藏的雄厚财富发掘出来。
    贯彻执行农业林业牧畜业多种经济全面发展的方针，是山区生产发展的道路，也是山区人民生活改善的决定环节。例如昔阳县刀把口村，在过去是一个穷困的山庄，1944年以来，由于贯彻执行了组织起来、全面发展农林牧多种经济的方针，到现在已经发生了根本的变化。现在除把原有二百亩耕地全部修成梯田外，又新修梯田六十多亩，产量比抗战以前提高60％，每户平均有大牲口两头多，羊二十只，猪近两口，鸡十多只，蜜蜂一箱多。全村有成材林、茅林等一万七千五百亩，其中有成材林四百亩，成材树十六万株。如果把全村的财产折成现金，共有三十六万多元，每户平均有一万多元。有的人说，刀把口村的农户，已经是拥有“万贯家产”的富裕农户了。去年这里虽然遭到严重的涝灾和洪灾，使农业生产减产50％，但是除去农业税负担和农业合作社的一切扣除，每户平均收入还有三百三十元，每人平均收入七十四元五角。类似刀把口村的事例，还可以举出很多。
    我们也看到了忽视对农林牧多种经济全面发展的偏向。如盂县下石塘乡的自然条件比刀把口村稍好一些，但这个乡1956年生产的粮食每人平均只有二百六十斤，其它收入每户平均不到四十元。主要原因，就是这个乡忽视农林牧多种经济的全面发展。
    一般地说，粮食生产是山区生产的中心和基础，各种不同类型的山区都应该重视粮食生产，以解决人的口粮、油料问题以及牲畜的饲料问题。但是，与重视粮食生产的同时，必须因地制宜地发展畜牧业、林业和其他各种副业生产。发展各种副业生产，可以保证农业生产稳步地上升；发展林业可以保持水土，发展畜牧业不仅为农业提供了良好的畜力条件，而且为农业提供了充足的肥料条件。这都是农业增产的保证。
    贯彻执行农林牧多种经济全面发展的方针，不仅是山区人民富裕的必由之路，而且是山区支援国家建设和巩固工农联盟的必由之路。当前工业对农业、城市对乡村的迫切要求，是供应轻工业原料，建筑材料，消费资料，如木材、麻类、皮毛、肉食、干鲜果品、土特产品等等。其中有些产品不仅国内市场迫切需要，而且是重要的出口物资。现在，山区人民已经供给国家一部分的上述物资，但远远不能满足国家对山区的要求。今后，只有在普遍地贯彻执行农林牧多种经济全面发展的方针以后，才能逐步地满足国家的需要，才能更进一步巩固工农联盟，山区人民的生活才可以更加富裕。
    发展山区经济的几项主要政策问题
    我们检查了一些地区的财政经济政策的执行情况。一般说，国家的财经政策是正确的，执行的情况也是比较好的。但是，某些政策由于执行上的偏差，群众和干部有不少意见。归纳起来，有以下几点：山地和平川的农业税负担不够平衡，贫瘠山区农业税的负担比较重；某些不应该收归国有的森林却收归国有，这些森林的林权应该清理；国有森林（甚至包括私人的零星林木）管理过严过死，没有照顾山区群众靠山吃山的历史习惯；某些农副产品的价格偏低；对农村市场管理过严过死，不按照商品的流转规律而按行政区划确定的商品流转方向，结果使山区人民吃了亏；商业系统（包括供销社）某些干部的资产阶级的经营作风，损害了山区人民的利益。
    这些意见是正确的。从1956年第三季度开始，党政机关即已着手研究解决。截至现在，有的已经基本上解决了，如放宽农村市场管理问题，调整贫瘠山区农业税负担问题，某些农副产品的价格调整问题，商品流转方向问题等；有的正在解决，如清理林权问题，放宽国有森林管理问题等；有的正在研究解决办法，如山地、平川的农业税的负担平衡问题，改进商业系统干部的作风问题等。切实加强对山区建设的领导
    山西省各级党政领导机关，过去对山区建设的领导一般说是重视的，但是也有关怀不够、措施不力、措施不当和一般化的缺点或错误。今后，要抓紧以下几点工作：
    一、为了加强对山区建设的领导，各级党委和政府的主要负责同志，应该有人分工管理山区建设工作，并且首先总结几年来山区建设的经验教训；省级党政领导机关派负责干部到山区视察工作的方法应该坚持，使它形成制度。要制订出全省的山区建设规划，使山区人民群众有一个明确的奋斗目标。为了加强对山区建设的领导，应该结合这次精简机构，从省、专两级机关中抽调一批熟悉农村工作的干部，充实到山区各县县级机关和乡。
    二、抓紧规划工作和计划工作。为了有计划有步骤地贯彻执行农林牧多种经济全面发展的方针，每个县每个乡每个合作社都要加强调查研究工作，自上而下、自下而上相结合地做好全面规划的工作，制定或修定自己的远景规划，制定1957年的生产计划，并且在实践中不断地加以修正。根据几年来特别是1956年制定规划和计划的经验教训，在制定规划和计划的时候，应该掌握以下原则，这就是：国家要求、群众需要和本地区的情况与特点相结合的原则，农业、林业、畜牧业、副业以及手工业、地方工业等多种经济全面地、按比例地发展的原则，既积极先进又充分可靠的原则，群众当前利益和长远利益相结合的原则。
    三、切实加强对党员的教育工作和党的宣传鼓动工作。由于山西省山区大部分为老革命根据地，所以山区群众的政治觉悟一向较高。但是随着生产关系的改变，在群众思想上也出现了不少新的思想问题（这些思想问题，归根到底是小生产者思想残余的表现）。例如对于农业高级合作化以后农村的主要矛盾认识不清，对于建设社会主义的农村（山区）的方向认识不清，认为天下太平，革命成功，再没有什么奔头了。有的人认为没有拖拉机就不能建设社会主义，存在着消极等待拖拉机的思想，这种思想对于贯彻执行农林牧多种经济全面发展的方针是十分有害的。有的人认为拖拉机上不了山，社会主义上不了山，对建设山区没有信心，因而不安心于山区生产建设。在生产关系改变以后，许多社员对于个人利益、集体利益、国家利益三者之间的关系问题不能够正确地去处理。农民生产和生活上的一切要求，过去靠自己解决，现在一切都想依赖农业合作社；而合作社的干部在社员的支持与包围下，一切都想依赖国家解决。农民对于工人的生产和生活有某些误解。因此，要澄清这些思想问题，加强宣传教育工作是十分重要的。
