The Disabled But Not Useless
——Visiting a Training Class for the Blind
Guo E'quan

Anyone who has seen the film "The Spring River Flows East" will surely remember a scene in the film: a blind person begging on the street, singing in a low voice to the accompaniment of the erhu: "The crescent moon shines on the nine continents, some families are happy and some are sad, some families drink fine wine in tall buildings, and some wander on the streets." This is a microcosm of the tragic fate of blind people in old China. They could truly be said to have "no place to live when alive, and no place to be buried when dead."

In the seven years since liberation, the situation of blind people in our country has fundamentally improved. Under the care of the Party and the government, they have taken up suitable jobs. Blind schools in various places have accepted a large number of blind children. Elderly blind people have also been properly settled and cared for by the government. Many blind people have demonstrated outstanding talents on various labor fronts.

On a sunny winter day, I visited the blind training class founded two years ago by the China Blind Welfare Association with great excitement. In the office, several responsible comrades of the training class (most of whom are blind) introduced the situation here to me.

The purpose of establishing the blind training class is to further explore the experience of guiding blind people to employment, and at the same time, to train some blind cadres. The one hundred and twenty-five male and female students here come from all over the country, and some are overseas Chinese who have returned from abroad. Among them are the people we respect most – officers and soldiers who were blinded in the Liberation War and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea; technicians, cadres and workers from institutions and factories who were blinded on duty; and blind people who used to wander the streets and had no one to rely on. The students study in industrial production, traditional Chinese medicine massage, cultural studies, and music specialty classes according to their own wishes and interests.

Walking towards the music class classroom, I heard pleasant music from afar. Upon entering, I saw that it was an orchestra composed of more than twenty people practicing. They skillfully played beautiful Cantonese music. If someone hadn't introduced them, I would have found it hard to believe that some of them had only been studying for a few months. This orchestra is now able to play more than forty pieces such as "Grand Reunion," "Spring Ploughing Song," "Emerald Lake Spring Dawn," "Mountain Wild Love Song," "Rain Hitting Banana Leaves," and "Golden Snake Dance," as well as more complex solo pieces and various majestic marches. They have recorded twice at the radio station and received many thank-you letters from listeners, including some from Japanese friends. Gan Bailin, a student, caught up with others who had been studying for two or three years after studying the erhu for a year. His teacher, Professor Liu Beimao of the Central Conservatory of Music, said: "I have been teaching the erhu for more than twenty years, and this is the first time I have encountered such a talented student." Now he has been hired by the cultural troupe of a certain unit of the Korean People's Army to serve as an erhu teacher. It is not easy for the blind to achieve these results. The music scores are copied into Braille symbols by oral dictation, and then memorized by touching them with their fingers. Students who could not read music in the past can now play the yangqin and sanxian independently.

In a room decorated like a clinic, there are several beds covered with white sheets. Human anatomy charts are hung on the wall, and models of various parts of the human body are placed on the table. Four blind people wearing white coats are massaging "patients." These are massage class students interning with each other. Learning massage requires understanding human anatomy and some necessary medical knowledge. Students often use plaster human body models to study the structure and characteristics of various parts of the human body. Under the guidance of teachers, after more than half a year, they have basically mastered the theory and techniques of massage. In their internships, they treated many students in the training class suffering from neurasthenia, gastrointestinal diseases, enuresis, arthritis, rheumatism, neuralgia, edema, and other diseases, and the patients' conditions improved. Zhang Guilin, a student, cured the paralyzed arm of an old man in his sixties that had been paralyzed for more than ten years. Now students regularly go to the Beijing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital for clinical practice. Many patients trust them very much and specifically ask them for massages.

In the classroom of the cultural studies class, there is no noise at all. Some students are touching the raised dots on large Braille books, while others are using styluses to prick dense small holes on thick paper through the small holes on metal plates, making a rhythmic ticking sound from time to time. They are reading Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report on revising the Party Constitution at the Eighth National Congress of the Party and writing outlines for speeches in preparation for discussion. Braille is a phonetic script represented by raised dots that are recognized by touching them with the index finger. It was created in 1952 by Comrade Huang Nai, director of the Braille Education Department of the Ministry of Education (a Communist Party member who became blind in 1949), based on Russian Braille phonetics and writing. Each letter is represented by six dots in different positions. There are 55 letters in total. The fastest students in the class can read Braille books at a rate of about 10,000 words per hour, and write at a speed of more than 2,000 words per hour. Blind school teachers and blind cadres studying here are working hard to improve their cultural and political theory level. They have organized a political economy study group and a Russian radio listening group. Several students have graduated early and have been sent to blind schools to serve as teachers.

In the knitting group of the industrial production class, I saw various sweaters, vests, gloves, children's clothing, etc. knitted by the students. They can weave flowers, plants, figures, and landscapes made up of six different colors. According to regulations, they only work six hours a day; but many students work more than eight hours, and some are reluctant to let go of even break time. Last year, they also gave the sweaters they knitted themselves to foreign friends who came to visit, and received praise from the guests. Now their production has been incorporated into the cooperative's plan for processing at the Beijing Department Store. After a short period of study, the students in the rattan production group have mastered the technology of weaving rattan boxes, rattan bags, round tables, rattan chairs, dressing tables, small stools, and tool baskets. He Shouheng, a student, created a texture adjuster that tripled work efficiency, and the patterns on the rattan ware were particularly neat and beautiful. It seems that their finished products are no less inferior than those sold on the market. They also created a needle threader that threads needles accurately and quickly. Wang Xueren, a student, designed a punching device used to punch holes in book pages, which increased efficiency by more than twenty times. Now, "Blind People's Monthly" and the textbooks used by blind schools all over the country, as well as various reading materials for the blind, are bound by them themselves.

The responsible comrades of the training class said that an agricultural production group was once set up in the training class, but it was cancelled a few days ago because the land used was to be used for road construction. This group achieved extraordinary results in more than a year of hard work. In the spring of 1956, after the thaw, the students sowed seeds of sorghum, corn, soybeans, peanuts, kidney beans, cotton and other crops in nineteen mu of land. In the summer, they braved the fiery sun to weed and fertilize in the fields. Their crops grew strong and tall, and passers-by and nearby farmers praised them. Although the corn, which grew more than seven feet tall, was blown down by the strong wind, it still yielded more than 700 jin per mu. Cotton and peanuts also had a bumper harvest. In agricultural and sideline production, blind people also learned to weave more than ten kinds of utensils such as chicken coops, tool baskets, and baskets.

Some people think that the lives of blind people must be boring and perhaps some people will be troubled by their physical defects all day long. However, the lives of blind people here are full of vitality. In the early morning, after the wake-up bell rings, a burst of noise comes from the playground, breaking the silence of the morning. A student told me that they have held several small sports meets, and the events include gymnastics, rope skipping, tug-of-war, and horizontal bars.

The students' dormitories are very clean, and the beds are covered with white or printed sheets. They can wash clothes, quilts, and handle various life problems themselves. In the early morning or evening, they listen to domestic and foreign news and music dramas, some read novels and "Blind People's Monthly," and some play blind chess or cards. Many students also participated in choirs and drama groups. They adapted Gao Yubao's "Midnight Rooster Crows" and "The Dog Bites Again" into plays and performed them at weekend evenings. The students are concerned about major domestic and foreign affairs. When they heard the news of the Anglo-French armed invasion of Egypt on the radio, they expressed that they would support the Egyptian people with practical actions. The students are very loving, united and help each other. At lunchtime, I saw some students leading other newly arrived students into the cafeteria. The students live very simply. Many students deposit various subsidies or disability allowances issued by the state in the bank or buy public bonds. Last year, the Party and League organizations of the training class admitted two students into the Party and seven students into the League respectively. The students are studying and living with full confidence, preparing to participate in socialist construction. Yan Zheng, a 23-year-old Youth League member, said to me: "The only thing that troubles us is that we contribute less to socialist construction than sighted people. But the state takes such good care of us. We must find ways to contribute more. Because we are blind people in the new society."

    残而不废的人们
    ——访盲人训练班
    郭锷权
    看过电影“一江春水向东流”的人，定会记得影片中的一个镜头：沿街乞食度日的盲人在二胡的伴奏下，用低沉的音调唱着：“月儿弯弯照九洲，几家欢乐几家愁，几家高楼饮美酒，几家流落在街头。”这是旧中国盲人悲惨命运的缩影。他们真可以说是“生无安身之处，死无葬身之地”。
    解放后七年多来，我国盲人的处境得到了根本的改善。在党和政府的关怀下，他们分别走上了适合的工作岗位。各地的盲童学校接纳了大批盲童。年迈的盲人也得到了政府的妥善安置和关照。不少的盲人在各个劳动战线上显示出了优异才能。
    在一个阳光普照的冬日，我怀着激动的心情访问了中国盲人福利会在两年前创办的盲人训练班。在办公室里，训练班的几位负责同志 （他们大多数是盲人）向我介绍了这里的情况。
    创办盲人训练班的目的，是为了进一步摸索辅导盲人就业的经验，同时，培养一些盲人工作干部。这里的一百二十五名男女学员来自全国各地，也有从海外归来的华侨。这里有我们最敬爱的人——在解放战争和抗美援朝战争中负伤失明的军官和战士；有因公失明的机关、工厂的技术员、干部和工人；也有过去流浪街头、无依无靠的盲人。学员们按照自己的志愿和爱好分别在工业生产、中医按摩、文化进修和音乐等专业班学习。
    向音乐班的教室走去，远远就听到了悦耳的音乐声。进去一看，原来是一个由二十多人组成的乐队在练习。他们熟练地演奏出优美的广东音乐。如果不是有人介绍，我很难相信他们当中的部分人只学习过几个月。这支乐队现在已经能够演奏“大联欢”、“春耕曲”、“翠湖春晓”、“山野情歌”、“雨打芭蕉”、“金蛇狂舞”等四十多只曲子，以及比较复杂的独奏曲和各种雄伟的进行曲。他们曾经在广播电台录过两次音，他们收到过许多听众寄来的感谢信，其中还有日本朋友寄来的。学员甘柏林，学习了一年二胡就赶上别人学习了两三年的水平。他的老师中央音乐学院教授刘北茂说：“我教了二十多年二胡，第一次遇到这样有才华的学生。”现在他被聘到朝鲜志愿军某部的文工团里担任二胡教员。盲人们获得这些成绩不是容易的。乐谱是在别人口授下抄成盲字符号，然后用手指触摸着记熟的。过去不能识谱的学员，现在都能够单独演奏洋琴、三弦琴了。
    在一间布置得像门诊室的房间里，摆着几张铺着白色床单的床铺。墙上挂着人体图，桌上摆着人体各部模型。四个穿着白外衣的盲人正在为“病人”按摩。这是按摩班的学员在互相实习。学习按摩必须懂得人体结构和一些必须的医学知识，学员们常用石膏人体模型来研究人体各部位的结构和特征。在教师的教导下，经过半年多的时间，他们基本上掌握了按摩的理论和技术。他们在实习中，对训练班中许多患神经衰弱、肠胃病、溢尿、关节炎、风湿症、神经痛、水肿等病症的学员进行了医治，使患者的病情都有了好转。学员张桂林曾为一位六十多岁的老人治好了已经麻痹了十多年的手臂。现在学员们常定期到北京市中医院为病人作临床实习。许多病人很相信他们，专门要他们按摩。
    文化进修班的教室里，没有一点喧哗声。学员们有的用手摸着大本盲字书籍上的凸点，有的用铁笔透过金属板上的小眼，在厚纸上扎着密密麻麻的小眼，不时地发出一种有规律的滴哒声音。这是他们在阅读邓小平同志在第八次党代表大会上作的关于修改党章的报告，并写发言提纲准备讨论。盲字是一种用凸点表示靠食指触摸辨认的拼音文字，是由教育部盲哑教育处处长黄乃同志（1949年失明的共产党员）在1952年根据俄语盲字拼音和书写创造的，每个字母由不同位置的六个点来表示。一共有55个字母。学员中阅读盲字书籍最快的每小时可达万字左右，写的速度每小时达两千余字。在这里学习的盲校教师和盲人工作干部，正在努力提高自己的文化和政治理论水平。他们组织了政治经济学学习小组和俄语广播收听小组。其中有几个学员已提前结业，被派到盲童学校里担任教员了。
    在工业生产班的针织组里，我看到了学员们织好的各种毛衣、背心、手套、童装等。他们能够织出由六种不同颜色配起来的花草、人物和山水。按规定，他们每天只工作六小时；但许多学员的工作时间都在八小时以上，有的连课间休息时间也不肯放过。去年他们还把自己亲手织的毛衣送给来参观的外国朋友，受到了客人们的赞扬。现在他们的生产已纳入了合作社的计划内，为北京百货大楼加工。藤器生产组的学员经过短期学习，已经掌握了编织藤箱、藤包、圆桌、藤椅、梳妆台、小凳、工具筐的技术。学员贺寿恒创造了一种调纹器，使工作效率提高了三倍，而且藤器上的花纹特别整齐美观。看来，他们的成品比市场上出卖的毫无逊色。他们还创造了一种穿针器，穿起来又准又快。学员王学仁设计了一种打眼器，用来在书页上扎眼，提高了效率二十多倍。现在“盲人月刊”以及全国各地盲童学校使用的教材，盲人的各种读物，都是由他们亲手装订的。
    训练班的负责同志说，在训练班里曾设有一个农业生产组，由于使用的土地要修路，所以前些日子取消了。这个组在一年多的辛勤劳动中获得了不平凡的成绩。1956年春天开冻后，学员们在十九亩地里播下了高粱、玉米、大豆、花生、扁豆、棉花等农作物的种子。夏天，他们冒着火红的太阳在地里除草、施肥。他们的庄稼长得粗壮高大，路过的行人和附近的农民都称赞不已。长得七尺多高的玉米虽被大风刮倒，但每亩地还收了七百多斤。棉花和花生也得到了丰收。在农副业的生产中，盲人还学会了编织鸡笼、工具筐、篮子等十多种用具。
    有人认为盲人的生活定会枯燥乏味，也许有些人终日会为自己的生理缺陷苦恼。但是，这里的盲人生活都充满了朝气。清晨，打过起床铃，操场上传来了一片喧哗声，冲破了清晨的寂静。一个学员告诉我，他们已举行过几次小型运动会，比赛的项目有体操、跳绳、拔河、单杠等。
    学员们的宿舍很整洁，床上都铺着白色或印花床单，他们自己会洗衣、被和处理各种生活问题。清晨或晚上，他们收听国内外新闻和音乐戏剧，有人阅读小说和“盲人月刊”，有人玩盲人象棋或扑克牌。许多学员还参加了合唱团和话剧组。他们把高玉宝写的“半夜鸡叫”和“狗又咬起来了”改编成话剧，在周末的晚会上演出。学员们关心着国内外大事。当他们从收音机里听到英法武装侵略埃及的消息时，都表示要在实际行动中支援埃及人民。学员们互相之间十分友爱团结、互相帮助。在吃午饭时，我见到一些学员手牵着另一些新来的学员走进食堂。学员们生活很朴素。不少学员把国家发给他们的各种补助或残废金存入银行或购买公债。训练班的党团组织在去年分别吸收了两名学员入党、七名学员入团。学员们满怀信心地学习和生活着，准备参加社会主义建设。二十三岁的青年团员严铮对我说：“我们感到苦恼的只有一点，就是我们在社会主义建设中比明眼人贡献得少。而国家对我们的照顾是这样好。我们一定要想法贡献得更多。因为我们是新社会里的盲人”。
