    Renowned Peking Opera Actress Xiao Cuihua
    Reports on Performing Arts to Young Actors

    (Our Newspaper) Esteemed *dan* (female role) performer Xiao Cuihua, who has been absent from the stage for many years, gave a report on "The Performing Methods of *Hua Dan* Roles" to over two hundred young opera actors in Beijing at an "Art Lecture" on the 1st of this month. This lecture was organized by the Beijing Opera and Drama Editorial Committee. Famous Peking Opera actors such as Zhang Junqiu, Ma Fulu, Liu Wenkui, and Liang Yiming also attended the lecture.

    Xiao Cuihua said, "The performance of *hua dan* roles requires achieving five qualities: beauty, charm, crispness, handsomeness, and stability." The veteran artist spoke and demonstrated simultaneously. While explaining basic knowledge such as finger techniques, eye expressions, body movements, and stage walking, Xiao Cuihua performed many actions on a small stage, including entrances, exits, fixing her hair, sitting, standing, performing a greeting (wanfu), going upstairs, going downstairs, and running around the stage. With a feeling of regret, Xiao Cuihua mentioned the behaviors of some *hua dan* performers on stage who act and sing haphazardly. She performed various body movements of two maids from "Hua Tian Cuo" and "Da Ying Tao" to illustrate that "the performance cannot deviate from the plot and the personality of the characters."

    Recording and compiling the excellent performing arts of veteran artists, and organizing young actors to learn from them, is an important task for inheriting the excellent traditions of opera art. In the subsequent "Art Lectures," the Beijing Opera and Drama Editorial Committee will also invite famous actors such as Hou Xirui, Ma Lianliang, and Ma Fulu to introduce their stage art respectively.

    著名京剧演员筱翠花
    向青年演员报告表演艺术
    本报讯  息影舞台多年的著名花旦筱翠花，本月1日在一次“艺术讲座”会上向北京市二百多青年戏曲演员报告了“花旦的表演方法”。这个讲座是由北京市戏曲编导委员会举办的。到会听讲的还有张君秋、马富禄、刘文魁、梁益鸣等著名京剧演员。
    筱翠花说：“花旦的表演，要求做到美、魅、脆、帅、稳五个字。”这位前辈老艺人一边讲，一边表演。在讲解指法、眼神、身段、台步等基本知识的时候，筱翠花在一座小舞台上表演了上场、下场、整鬓、坐、站、施礼（万福）、上楼、下楼、跑圆场等许多的动作。筱翠花怀着痛惜的心情提到了有些花旦在舞台上胡做、胡唱的行为。他表演了“花田错”和“打樱桃”里两个丫头的各种身段，来说明“表演不能脱离剧情和人物个性”。
    记录、整理老艺人的优秀的表演艺术，组织青年演员向他们学习，是继承戏曲艺术优秀传统的一项重要工作。在以后几次的“艺术讲座”中，北京市戏曲编导委员会还将邀请侯喜瑞、马连良、马富禄等著名演员，分别介绍他们的舞台艺术。
