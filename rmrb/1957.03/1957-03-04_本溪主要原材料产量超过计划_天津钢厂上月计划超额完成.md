Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, 2nd. This February, the output of raw materials such as steel, steel products, iron ore, raw coal, coke, and cement in Benxi City exceeded the state plan.

Many factories and mines in Benxi City have overproduced despite a shortage of raw materials. The Benxi Steel Plant lacked scrap steel and oxygen for steelmaking. Workers actively adopted new technologies and started to increase the proportion of pig iron in steelmaking to increase the production of high-quality steel urgently needed by the machinery industry. The average daily steel output of this plant also exceeded the highest daily output level in history. The quality of some factories and mines is also very good. The Benxi Coking Plant fulfilled its daily coke production plan every day in February, and the percentage of first-grade coke in the whole month increased by 25% compared with the same period last year. The Nanfen Mining General Plant increased the production of more than 20,000 tons of iron ore in February, and the quality of iron concentrate was fully qualified.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Nanfen Open-pit Iron Mine in Benxi completed the February production plan ahead of schedule on February 25.

Workers and technicians of this mine worked together to strengthen the weak links that have long affected production, smoothed ore transportation, and increased ore blasting volume. At the same time, the workers' sense of responsibility and mutual cooperation have also been generally strengthened. Workers in the electric shovel section and the automobile section respectively put forward the slogans of "fast loading" and "more hauling," eliminating the past phenomenon of pulling regardless of loading and loading regardless of pulling, and improving equipment utilization.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 1st. The Tianjin Steel Plant overfulfilled its February production plan. The output of steel ingots increased by 26.5% compared with the same period last year, and the output of steel products increased by 16% compared with the same period last year. The pass rate of products all exceeded the target.

The raw material composition of the Tianjin Steel Plant in February was not good, and the pig iron had a high sulfur content, which easily affected the quality and output of steel. However, due to the many effective measures taken by the steelmaking workers, the quality of steel ingots was guaranteed, and they also increased the proportion of molten iron, which increased the steel output per furnace by more than two tons.

    本溪主要原材料产量超过计划
    天津钢厂上月计划超额完成
    新华社本溪2日电  今年2月本溪市的钢、钢材、铁矿石、原煤、焦炭、水泥等原材料产量超过了国家计划。
    本溪市不少工厂矿山是在原料不足的情况下超产的。本溪钢厂废钢原料和炼钢的氧气缺乏，职工们积极采用新技术和开始多掺生铁炼钢增产了机械工业急需的优质钢。这个厂钢的平均日产量还超过了历史上最高的日产量水平。有些工厂矿山的产品质量也很好。本溪焦化厂2月份每天都完成焦炭日产量计划，全月焦炭一级品比去年同期提高了25％。南芬矿山总厂2月份增产了二万多吨铁矿石，铁选粉质量全部合格。
    据新华社讯  本溪南芬露天铁矿在2月25日提前完成了2月份生产计划。
    这个矿的工人同技术人员共同努力加强了长期影响生产的薄弱环节，使矿石运输道畅通，增加了矿石爆破量。同时，工人们的责任心和相互之间配合协作也普遍加强。电铲工段和汽车工段工人分别提出“快装”、“多拉”的口号，消除过去拉不管装、装不管拉的现象，提高了设备利用率。
    新华社天津1日电  天津钢厂超额完成了2月份生产计划，钢锭产量比去年同期增加26.5％，钢材产量比去年同期增加16％；产品的合格率，都超过了指标。
      2月份天津钢厂原料成分不好，生铁含硫高，容易影响钢的质量和产量。但是由于炼钢工人采取了许多有效措施，保证了钢锭质量，而且他们还加大铁水比重，使每炉的钢产量提高了两吨多。
