Turkey is one of the few countries in the Middle East that actively supports the "Eisenhower Doctrine" aggression plan. Turkish Prime Minister Menderes described the "Eisenhower Doctrine" as "a very firm step" by the United States, "which helps promote political stability in the Middle East." The United States also regards Turkey as a model country for accepting US "aid." When Dulles testified before the US Senate for the "Eisenhower Doctrine," he pointed out that the purpose of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" was to "help some Middle Eastern countries embark on the democratic path that Turkey has already taken."

However, Turkey is the first country in the Middle East to accept US "aid." What is the political and economic situation in its country?

From May 22, 1947, when Truman signed the "Act" to "aid" Turkey and Greece, until 1954, Turkey received a total of 1.5 billion US dollars in US military aid, in addition to several hundred million US dollars in economic aid. According to a recent report by the United Press, since the end of World War II, the total amount of US dollars received by Turkey alone accounts for more than 60% of the US economic and military "aid" received by Middle Eastern countries. This does not include the aid from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the loans provided by the United States through the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the US Export-Import Bank.

The United States provides "aid" to Turkey not to help Turkey embark on the "democratic path," as Dulles said, but to turn it into a base for the United States to launch aggressive wars in the Middle East and to provide cannon fodder. Facts show that since Turkey accepted US aid, it has been following the US policy of arms expansion and war preparations, and has successively joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact Group. The US military delegation stationed in Turkey has actually become the supreme government of Turkey. The United States has built a large number of military bases in Turkey. In 1954, there were more than 120 airports built on Turkey's territory of 760,000 square kilometers, most of which were military airports. The United States has more than a dozen naval bases in Turkey, of which Izmir is the location of the Southeast European Command of the North Atlantic Group and the Strategic Air Force Command. Turkey is densely covered with strategic highways, the widest of which is 50 meters, which can be used as an airstrip, and there is a radar station almost every dozen kilometers along the Black Sea coast. In this way, Turkey is actually under the occupation of the US military.

Under the control of the United States, Turkey has become the main country providing ground forces for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Turkey has a population of only more than 24 million and is the most economically backward country in the North Atlantic Group, but it has established an army of 580,000 people. Every forty Turks have to support a soldier. This force spends more than 50% of the national budget every year, but it is of no use to Turkey itself, and can only be used as cannon fodder for US aggression. The fact that a Turkish brigade was sent to Korea to participate in the war in the US aggression against Korea is proof of this.

In the name of "aid," the United States has strengthened its control over Turkey's economy and has actually turned Turkey into its colony. Before World War II, the United States' economic power in Turkey was negligible. In the middle of the war, the United States expanded the Lend-Lease Act to Turkey, and its tentacles of economic aggression extended into Turkey. In 1945, the United States had become the first in Turkey's foreign trade. Since Turkey accepted the economic "aid" of the "Truman Doctrine" in 1947, US monopoly capital has gradually controlled the entire economic lifeline of Turkey. In order to obtain US dollars, the Turkish authorities have formulated many laws that sell out national sovereignty, opening the door for US capital to invade Turkey. In 1947, it allowed foreign capital to export the profits it had made in Turkey. In 1950, it formulated a law to guarantee foreign investment. In 1951, it allowed foreigners to invest in all economic sectors in Turkey in any way, and enjoy the same rights as Turkish investment. After Landell, chairman of the US Foreign Economic Policy Planning Committee, put forward a proposal to restrict Turkish state-owned enterprises in August 1953, the Turkish government announced a law in early 1954 that did not impose any restrictions on foreign capital. At the same time, it announced a petroleum law drafted by the US oil capitalist Bauer, granting foreign companies unlimited privileges to explore for oil. In addition, the Turkish authorities have also signed many bilateral agreements with the United States, stipulating that the United States has the right to monopolize the mining of uranium mines in Turkey, and that US companies and US citizens are exempt from paying income tax and all other taxes to Turkey. The US magazine "Fortune" said: "Compared with any other ally of the United States, the Turks have created more favorable conditions for investment." According to the statistics in the book "American Interests in the Middle East Survey" published in Washington in 1953, there are as many as 180 American companies related to Turkey. Turkey's economic sovereignty has completely fallen into the hands of US monopoly capital.

At present, Turkey's economy is in a dangerous situation. In order to obtain US "aid," it must expand its arms and prepare for war, and the result of arms expansion and war preparation requires more US "aid," and it has actually fallen into a vicious circle. Turkey's military expenditure has accounted for more than 50% of the total budget for many years, and appropriations for national defense have increased year by year, from 580 million lira in 1953, 600 million lira in 1954, 720 million lira in 1955, 873 million lira in 1956, and this year it has exceeded 1 billion lira. At the same time, Turkey's foreign debt is increasing rapidly. According to statistics at the beginning of 1956, it amounted to 3 billion lira, which will not be paid off until the 21st century.

Accompanying long-term financial difficulties is inflation and rising prices. In 1946, before Turkey accepted the "Truman Doctrine" aid, the exchange rate between gold lira and banknotes was 34.3 to 1; but by April 1955, it became 69.8 to 1, and the banknotes depreciated by more than double in ten years. However, the people's living standards have declined even faster than the currency value. According to official statistics, the cost of living in 1955 was more than three times higher than before the Second World War. According to the French "International Forum," food prices have increased tenfold compared to 1938.

The serious threat of inflation and the intrusion of US monopoly capital have made the situation of Turkey's national economy increasingly difficult. Before the Second World War, Turkey once adopted a policy of restricting the activities of foreign capital and developing its own economy, and with the help of Soviet interest-free loans, it began to establish its own national industry. By 1939, Turkey already had sugar industry, match industry, paper industry, textile industry and rayon industry, etc. However, as a result of accepting US aid after the war, Turkey's original textile, cement and other industries were controlled by US capital. Its important raw material, chromite ore, has to be purchased by foreign monopoly capital, and all the machinery and daily necessities it needs have to be imported from the United States, while Turkey's traditional foreign markets are crowded out by US capital. In the past ten years, Turkey's foreign trade has always been more imports than exports. According to statistics from the New York "Business Daily" at the beginning of 1956, Turkey's foreign trade deficit has reached 750 million US dollars. As a result, a large number of Turkish industrial enterprises have closed down, and the number of unemployed people has increased to nearly three million.

Impoverished people and exhausted finances, many soldiers and many debts, these are the disastrous consequences that US aid has brought to Turkey. Now, the United States is trying to promote the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the Middle East. In addition to military threats, it also proposes so-called economic "aid" to Middle Eastern countries. However, as long as you look at Turkey's example, you can clearly see what kind of medicine is sold in the gourd of the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine."

    土耳其的榜样
    邢象超
    土耳其是中东地区积极为“艾森豪威尔主义”侵略计划捧场的少数几个国家之一。土耳其总理曼德列斯把“艾森豪威尔主义”说成是美国的“一个非常坚定的步骤”， “有助于促使中东地区的政治稳定”。美国也将土耳其作为接受美“援”的典范国家来看待，杜勒斯在美国参院为“艾森豪威尔主义”作证时，曾指出“艾森豪威尔主义”的目的就在于“帮助某些中东国家走上土耳其已经走上了的民主道路”。
    但是，土耳其是中东地区最先接受美 “援”的国家，它国内的政治、经济情况究竟怎样呢？
    从1947年5月22日杜鲁门签署“援助”土耳其和希腊“法案”到1954年止，土耳其一共得到美国军事援助共达十五亿美元，此外，还有几亿美元的经济援助。据合众社最近透露，自从第二次大战结束以来，土耳其一国接受美元总数占中东各国得到的美国经济和军事“援助”的60％以上，这还不算北大西洋公约组织的援助和美国通过国际复兴开发银行、美国进出口银行提供的贷款。
    美国向土耳其提供“援助”，并不是像杜勒斯所说的是要帮助土耳其走上“民主道路”，而是要把它变成美国在中东地区发动侵略战争的基地和提供炮灰的国家。事实说明，自土耳其接受美援以后，它就一直追随美国的扩军备战政策，先后参加了北大西洋公约组织和巴格达条约集团。美国驻在土耳其的军事代表团，实际上成了土耳其的太上政府。美国在土耳其建筑了大批的军事基地，在1954年，在七十六万平方公里的土耳其领土上，筑有一百二十多个飞机场，其中大多数是军用机场。美国在土耳其有十多个海军基地，其中伊斯密尔是北大西洋集团东南欧司令部和战略空军司令部的所在地。土耳其全境密布战略公路，最宽的地方竟达五十公尺，可作飞机跑道之用，而在黑海沿岸几乎每隔十几公里就有一个雷达站。这样，土耳其实际上已经处于美军占领之下了。
    在美国的控制下，土耳其已经成为北大西洋公约集团提供地面部队的主要国家。土耳其人口仅有二千四百多万，又是北大西洋集团中经济上最落后的一个国家，但是它却建立了一支数达五十八万人的军队。每四十个土耳其人，就得养活一个士兵。这支部队每年花掉了50％以上的国家预算，对土耳其自己却毫无用处，仅仅能当美国的侵略炮灰。在美国侵略朝鲜的战争中，土耳其一个旅被派往朝鲜参战就是一个证明。
    在“援助”的名义下，美国对土耳其的经济已经加强控制，实际上已经把土耳其变成它的殖民地。第二次世界大战以前，美国在土耳其的经济势力是微不足道的。大战中期，美国把租借法案扩大到土耳其，它的经济侵略的触角便伸进了土耳其，1945年，美国已跃居土耳其对外贸易的第一位。从1947年土耳其接受“杜鲁门主义”的经济“援助”以后，美国垄断资本逐渐控制了土耳其的整个经济命脉。土耳其当局为了获得美元，前后制订了许多出卖国家主权的法律，为美国资本侵入土耳其大开方便之门。它在1947年准许外国资本输出在土耳其所取得的利润，1950年制订了保证外国投资的法律，1951年准许外国人以任何方式在土耳其所有经济部门投资，并且和土耳其的投资享受同等权利。1953年8月美国对外经济政策计划委员会主席朗戴尔提出限制土耳其国营企业的建议书后，土耳其政府便在1954年初公布一个对外国资本不加任何限制的法律，同时公布了一个由美国石油资本家鲍尔起草的石油法，给予外国公司勘探石油的无限特权。另外，土耳其当局还和美国签订了许多双边协定，规定美国有权垄断土耳其铀矿的开采，美国公司和美国公民免向土耳其缴纳所得税和其他一切捐税。美国“幸福”杂志说：“同美国其他任何同盟者相比，土耳其人已经创造了对投资更加有利的条件”。根据1953年华盛顿出版的“美国在中东利益调查”一书的统计，和土耳其有关系的美国公司共达一百八十家之多。土耳其的经济主权已经完全落在美国垄断资本手里了。
    目前，土耳其的经济已经处于危险的境地。它为了得到美“援”，就必须扩军备战，而扩军备战的结果，又需要更多的美“援”，实际上已经坠入了恶性循环中。土耳其的军费开支，许多年来一直占总预算的50％以上，对国防的拨款年年增加，1953年是五亿八千万里拉，1954年六亿里拉，1955年七亿二千多万里拉，1956年是八亿七千三百万里拉，而今年已经超过十亿里拉。同时，土耳其的外债正急剧增加，据1956年初统计共达三十亿里拉，要到二十一世纪才能还得清。
    伴随着长期财政困难而来的是通货膨胀和物价上涨。土耳其在1946年，即接受“杜鲁门主义”援助以前，金里拉和纸币兑换率是三十四点三比一；但到1955年4月变成了六十九点八比一，十年间纸币贬值了一倍多。但是，人民生活水平比起币值下降得更快，据官方的统计，1955年的生活费用比二次大战前上涨了三倍多。据法国“国际论坛”报道，食品价格比1938年上涨了十倍。
    通货膨胀的严重威胁和美国垄断资本的侵入，使得土耳其的民族经济处境越来越困难。二次大战以前，土耳其曾经采取限制外国资本活动和发展本国经济的政策，在苏联无息贷款的帮助下，着手建立自己的民族工业。到1939年，土耳其已经有了制糖工业、火柴工业、造纸工业、纺织工业和人造丝工业等。但战后接受美援的结果，土耳其的原有纺织、水泥等工业都被美国资本所控制。它的重要原料铬矿砂，得靠外国垄断资本收买，它所需要的全部机器和日用品得从美国输入，而土耳其传统的国外市场则受到美国资本的排挤。近十年来，土耳其的对外贸易一直是进口多，出口少。据纽约“商务日报”1956年初的统计，土耳其对外贸易赤字已高达七亿五千万美元。这样，引起了土耳其的工业企业大批倒闭，目前失业人数已增加到将近三百万人。
    民穷财尽，兵多债多，这就是美援带给土耳其的灾难性的后果。现在，美国企图在中东地区推行什么“艾森豪威尔主义”，除了军事威胁之外，也提出了所谓经济“援助”中东国家。但是，只要看看土耳其的榜样，就可以清楚地看出所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”的葫芦里究竟是卖的什么药了。
