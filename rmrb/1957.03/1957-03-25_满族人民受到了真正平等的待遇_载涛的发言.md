　　I have listened to Chairman Mao's instructions at the Supreme State Conference, Premier Zhou's "Report on Visits to Eleven Asian and European Countries," and the special reports by various leaders, and I fully endorse them.

　　Under the brilliant national policy of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our Manchu people have universally received warmth, the same treatment as all our fraternal ethnic groups, and powerful encouragement. Please allow me to first express the sincere and collective gratitude of our Manchu people!

　　Most of our Manchu people are scattered throughout the country. Although there are small, concentrated settlements in various locations, they are relatively dispersed. For decades, the reactionary rule's great-Han chauvinism implemented various oppressions and discriminations, causing the Manchu people to suffer greatly. As a result, most concealed their ethnic identity, and at the same time, suffered considerable damage in terms of production, work opportunities, and cultural education.

　　After liberation, the people's democratic government was victoriously established. The brilliance of the great national policy warmed the hearts of every ethnic minority person and illuminated every corner inhabited by ethnic minorities. All ethnic groups in China were unprecedentedly united into a warm family. This is something every Chinese person feels, and even more so, it is something every Manchu person rejoices in and is moved to tears of gratitude for. Currently, the Party and the government pay great attention to and quickly resolve the demands of the vast Manchu population, whether in terms of production or cultural education. From principled measures to minor emotional issues, everything is valued. This is truly equal treatment that our Manchu people have never received before.

　　In 1955 and 1956, I continuously inspected Manchu-inhabited areas, from the suburbs around Beijing to as far as Guangzhou and Chengdu. I met a great many Manchu people. Their excitement and passionate feelings were indescribable. In many places, it was felt that there were more Manchu people, not because the population suddenly increased, but because many people revealed their ethnic identity. They dared to speak their minds to their relatives and dared to offer suggestions. The problems that existed, I reported to the central government and reflected to the local provincial people's committees, and they were all adopted. Therefore, the Party and the government's concern for the Manchu people has become a motivating force for every Manchu person and a cohesive force for close friendship between the Manchu people and every fraternal ethnic group.

　　Recently, the Manchu and Mongolian people in Chengdu jointly organized a study committee, and wrote to say that this was a joyous event, and said: "Everyone applauded and cheered, praising the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao." Their feelings can be imagined. A Manchu primary school has also been established in Guangzhou. Only the term "meticulous care" can express the extent of the warmth felt in the hearts of the Manchu people.

　　On behalf of the Manchu people, I guarantee to the Party, to Chairman Mao, and to the government: From now on, we will only study harder, give full play to everyone's enthusiasm, and contribute everything to the socialist construction cause of the motherland and the ethnic family!

### 满族人民受到了真正平等的待遇　载涛的发言

　　满族人民受到了真正平等的待遇
　　载涛的发言
    我听了毛主席在最高国务会议上的指示，周总理关于“访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告”和各位首长的专题报告，我完全拥护。
    在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的民族政策照耀下，我们满族人民普遍的得到温暖、得到和各兄弟民族所受的同等待遇、得到有力的鼓舞，请容我首先表达我们满族人民衷心共同的感激！
    我们满族人民大部分散在全国各地，在各处当地虽然有小部分聚居的，但是究竟比较散漫。几十年来反动统治的大民族主义，施行种种压迫和歧视。使得满族人民受尽苦痛，因此大部分的隐瞒起自己的民族成份，同时在生产上、在工作机会上、在文化教育上都受到相当的损害。
    到了解放后，人民民主政权胜利的建成了。伟大的民族政策的光辉，照热了每一个少数民族人民的心，照亮了每一个少数民族居住的角落，全中国各个民族空前的团结成了一个亲热的大家庭，这是每一个中国人民所共同感到的，更是每一个满民所欢欣鼓舞而感激涕零的。现在广大的满民的要求，无论是生产上、是文化教育上，党和政府没有不十分重视和迅速予以解决的，从原则的措施直到细小的情绪问题都受到重视，这是我们满族人民从来未曾受到的真正平等的待遇。
    我在1955年、1956年连续的视察了满民居住区域，近的从京郊四周围，远到广州和成都，见到极多的满民，他们那种兴奋而热烈的情感，我是无法用语言来描写的。在许多地方，感到满民多起来，并不是人口突然增加，而是许多人说出了自己的民族成份。心里的话也敢和亲人说了，有建议也敢提了。存在的问题我向中央汇报和向当地省人民委员会反映，也都获得采纳。因此党和政府对满民的关怀，在每个满民身上都成为积极性的发动力量。也成了满民和每个兄弟民族之间亲密友爱的粘合力量。
    最近成都的满族和蒙古族人民共同组织了一个学习委员会，写信来说这是一件喜事，并且说：“大家鼓掌欢呼，称颂中国共产党和毛主席。”他们的心情是可以想像得知的。广州也成立了满族小学。只有“无微不至”这个语汇，才能在这里表达满民们内心感受的温暖程度。
    我谨代表满族人民向党、向毛主席、向政府保证：今后只有更加努力学习，发挥每个人的积极性，为祖国、民族大家庭的社会主义建设事业而贡献一切！（附图片）
