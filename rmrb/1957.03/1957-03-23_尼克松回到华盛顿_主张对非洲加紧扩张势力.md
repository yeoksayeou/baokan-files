Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: U.S. Vice President Nixon, who had been active in Africa, returned to Washington on the 21st. During his twenty-two days, he visited eight countries: Ghana, Liberia, Ethiopia, Uganda, Morocco, Libya, Sudan, and Tunisia.

He told reporters that the newly independent African countries "deeply cherish their independence" and are "very wary" of anyone attempting to dominate the region. He emphasized that the United States should intensify its propaganda activities there.

He advocated that the United States accelerate economic assistance to Africa, especially technical assistance. He believes that such expenses are small compared to the importance of pulling Africa into the Western world.

News reports indicate that Nixon will present his specific recommendations in a report to Eisenhower.

　　尼克松回到华盛顿
　　主张对非洲加紧扩张势力
    据新华社22日讯　到非洲进行活动的美国副总统尼克松21日回到华盛顿。他在二十二天中，访问了加纳、利比里亚、埃塞俄比亚、乌干达、摩洛哥、利比亚、苏丹和突尼斯八个国家。
    他对新闻记者说，非洲新独立的国家都“十分珍爱它们的独立”，而对于企图统治这个地区的任何人都“很警觉”。他强调美国要加紧在那里的宣传活动。
    他主张美国要加速对非洲进行经济援助，特别是技术援助。他认为，这种费用比起把非洲拉到西方世界去的重要性来算是小的。
    消息说，尼克松将在向艾森豪威尔的报告中提出他的具体建议。
