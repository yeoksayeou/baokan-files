　　The Mulam People are Moving Forward Rapidly
　　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Liu Yuanxiu
    After getting off the train and switching to a bus, it only takes a little over three hours to reach Luocheng County, northwest of Liuzhou, one of the areas where the Mulam people live in concentrated communities.
    As soon as the bus entered the territory of Luocheng County, the passengers on the bus told me that the villages and settlements along the road were the places where the Mulam people lived. The villages and settlements are mostly located next to steep, solitary mountains, and the houses are built of bricks and tiles. In the fields surrounding the villages, green wheat fields are beginning to head and blossom, and many Mulam men and women commune members are still busy plowing, raising seedlings, and sowing early corn. Not far from the county seat, there is a motor road extending to the southwest, connecting the county seat with another large market town—Siba. Siba and Luocheng, the two largest towns in the county, are considered to be the economic and cultural centers of the Mulam people.

　  The Mulam Working Class is Growing
    Getting off the bus in Luocheng and walking fifteen li, you reach the newly built sulfur mine in the Mulam area. The mining area is very large, and after exploration, it has been proven that the sulfur reserves are 700,000 tons. More than 300 workers in the mining area are working intensely to mine and refine sulfur. Among these workers, Mulam workers account for 45.3% of the total number of people. The Mulam workers are uniting and learning with the Han and Zhuang workers in the mining area, and they are making rapid progress. At the end of last year, three Mulam workers were promoted to shift leaders. Not long ago, among the sixty-four advanced producers selected by the factory and mine, Mulam workers accounted for fourteen. Mulam youth Mu Ying'ao was originally a poor child who dug coal by hand. When he came to work at the mine in 1955, he didn't understand anything, but now he is a very skilled mining expert. Pan Daibin, the leader of the sulfur refining team, is a representative of the Mulam workers in Luocheng County. He didn't understand the technology of sulfur refining before, but now his sulfur recovery rate has reached a higher level in the entire mining area—19%.

    Having University Students from Our Own Nationality
    In the past few days, I have spoken with the Mulam County Head of Luocheng County, elderly people, and students, and learned about the cultural conditions of this ethnic group in the past from them. In their memories, they have never heard of anyone from their ethnic group who has attended university; even the number of people studying in middle school is less than ten out of the 41,000 Mulam people in the entire county. Before liberation, out-of-school children accounted for more than 70% of school-age children. Now the situation has changed. Every township has three or four primary schools, and the number of children enrolled in school accounts for 90% of school-age children. The number of middle school students has increased to more than 220, and for the first time, there are Mulam university students. Among the six university students, one has graduated and started working, and the other five are studying at Beijing Institute of Geology, Wuhan University, Guilin Agricultural College, and other schools.

    Hardworking Mulam Women
    Anyone who has been to Guangxi admires the good work of the women here. The Mulam women, like the Zhuang and Han women in the entire province, are also skilled laborers. In the fields, on the roads, and in the deep mountains, you can always see Mulam women with white cloths wrapped around their heads or with their hair cut short, barefoot and with their trouser legs rolled up, plowing, harrowing, raising seedlings, collecting firewood, or carrying burdens. According to a survey, the female labor force in agricultural cooperatives is generally more than the male labor force, and each agricultural cooperative has one or several female commune cadres. Wu Xiaomei, the deputy township head and production team leader of Fengwu Township, works hard and is responsible. The average yield of the six production teams in the entire cooperative last year was 450 jin, and the average yield of the production team she led was as high as 490 jin, so she was rated as the only special-class labor model in the county.
    Mulam women are not only good at working, but also particularly active in learning and good at singing. Now most adult women are participating in night school. In addition to a calligraphy textbook, each of them also has a self-compiled and self-sung folk song book. Luo Yumei, a young woman from Zhangluo Township, has self-compiled folk songs that are said to take three days and three nights to sing completely. I casually flipped through the folk song book she brought out, and among the lyrics compiled in the form of "answering spontaneously," there are love songs sung by men and women facing each other when "walking on the slope," and there are folk songs praising Chairman Mao and advanced cooperatives; the folk songs compiled in the form of "ancient strips" are all historical myths and stories. Because she is the best at singing folk songs in the entire county, she won the third prize in the provincial literary and artistic performance.

### 仫佬族人民在快步前进

　　仫佬族人民在快步前进
　　新华社记者　刘远修
    下了火车，改乘公共汽车，只需三个多小时就到了仫佬族聚居区之一柳州西北的罗城县。
    汽车刚进入罗城县境，车上的旅客告诉我，路旁一个个的村屯就是仫佬族居住的处所。村屯大都坐落在尖峭的独山旁边，房屋是用砖瓦砌成的。村周围纵横相连的田地里，一片片绿油油的麦子开始抽穗扬花，许多仫佬族男女社员还在忙着犁田、育秧、播种早玉米。离县城不远，有一条伸向西南去的汽车路，把县城同另一大集镇——四把连接起来。四把和罗城这两个全县较大的城镇，被认为是仫佬族人民的经济、文化中心。
　  仫佬族工人阶级在成长
    在罗城下车，步行十五里路，就到了仫佬族地区新建的硫磺矿。矿区面积很广，经勘探证明，硫磺的蕴藏量有七十万吨。矿区三百多工人正紧张地开采和提炼硫磺。在这些工人里面，仫佬族工人占总人数的45.3％。仫佬族工人和矿区汉族、僮族工人团结学习，进步很快。去年年底，有三个仫佬族工人被提升为值班长。不久前厂矿评选出来的六十四个先进生产者，仫佬族工人占十四名。仫佬族青年仫应鳌，原是一个用手扒煤的穷孩子，1955年到矿上工作时，什么也不懂，现在已经是一个非常熟练的采矿能手。炼硫组组长潘代斌，是罗城县仫佬族工人代表，他原来不懂炼硫的技术，现在他炼硫的收回率已达到全矿区较高的水平——19％。
    有了本民族的大学生
    几天来，我和罗城县仫佬族县长、老年人和学生谈话，从他们了解这个民族过去的文化状况。在他们的记忆里，从没听说过本民族有人上过大学；在中学读书的，全县四万一千仫佬族人中连十个也不到。解放前，失学儿童占学龄儿童70％以上。现在情况改变了，每个乡都有三四所小学，入学儿童占学龄儿童的90％。中学生增加到二百二十多人，并且第一次有了仫佬族大学生。六个大学生中，有一个已毕业参加工作，其他五个分别在北京地质学院、武汉大学、桂林农学院等校学习。
    勤劳的仫佬族妇女
    到过广西的人，谁都钦佩这里的妇女的劳动好。仫佬族妇女同全省僮族、汉族妇女一样，也是劳动能手。在田地里，在马路上，在深山中，你随时都能看到头上包着白布或剪了发、赤着脚卷起裤腿的仫佬族妇女在犁田、耙田、育秧、打柴或挑担。据调查，农业社的妇女劳动力一般比男的多，每个农业社都有一个或几个妇女社干部。凤梧乡副乡长兼农业社生产队长吴小妹，工作艰苦负责。全社六个生产队去年的平均产量四百五十斤，她领导的生产队平均产量高到四百九十斤，因此被评为全县唯一的特等劳动模范。
    仫佬族妇女不仅劳动好，学习也特别积极，又善于歌唱，现在大部分成年妇女都参加夜校读书。她们每人除一本习字课本外，还有一本自编自唱的山歌。章罗乡青年妇女罗玉美，自编的山歌据说三天三夜都唱不完。我随手翻了一下她拿出的山歌本子，其中用“随口答”形式编成的歌词，有“走坡”时男女对唱的情歌，有歌颂毛主席、高级社的山歌；用“古条”形式编成的山歌，全是历史神话故事。因为全县数她的山歌唱的好，所以获得全省文艺会演三等奖。
