Xinhua News Agency, March 1st: The famous French film actor Philippe said to reporters in Beijing today that French film industry people are increasingly interested in strengthening ties between the French and Chinese film industries. A Chinese Film Week will be held in Paris this year. The two sides are specifically studying the matter of a Sino-French co-produced film, and French screenwriter Pierre Géraldy is preparing to write the script for this film. Philippe said that if the theme is determined and it is suitable for him to play, he would be very willing to play the role.

At a press conference today, Philippe also talked about his impressions of visiting Beijing, and expressed his views on Chinese films and classical dramas.

Philippe said that of the several Chinese films he saw in Beijing, he liked "The Spring River Flows East" the most. He praised the artistic talent of the film's director. He then criticized that he heard that the director of this film, Cai Chusheng, has been too busy to direct new films for several years, which is a pity.

He said that he also watched a lot of Peking Opera in Beijing this time. Philippe praised the expressiveness of Peking Opera, and made suggestions on the adaptation of certain plots of the Peking Opera "Little Cowherd."

When reporters asked him about his general impressions of Beijing, Philippe said that he was deeply impressed by the new atmosphere and vitality he saw while strolling on the streets of Beijing. Philippe also said that recently many Chinese audiences have been visiting him at his residence, the Beijing Hotel. He said: Every time Chinese audiences visit me, I feel closer to China. The enthusiastic eyes of these Chinese audiences remind me of the French audiences who look at me with the same eyes in front of the National People's Theater in Paris.

    法国名演员菲利浦畅谈访问北京印象
    新华社1日讯  法国著名电影演员菲利浦今天对北京的记者们说：法国电影界人士对加强法、中两国电影界的联系越来越感到兴趣。今年将在巴黎举行中国电影周。关于中、法两国合拍影片的事情两方面正具体研究中，法国电影剧本作家皮戈耳准备为这部片子写剧本。菲利浦说，如果主题确定，也适于由他来演，他很愿意演这部片子。
    菲利浦今天在记者招待会上，还畅谈了他访问北京的印象，并且对中国影片和古典戏剧发表了观感。
    菲利浦说，在北京看到的几部中国影片中，他最喜欢“一江春水向东流”。他赞扬这部影片的导演的艺术才能。接着他提出批评说，听说这部影片的导演蔡楚生几年来因为事情忙一直没有时间导演新影片，这是很可惜的。
    他说，这次他在北京又看了不少京剧。菲利浦赞扬京剧的表现力，并且对京剧“小放牛”某些情节的改编提出了意见。
    当记者问到他对北京的一般观感时，菲利浦说，在北京街头散步时所看到的新气象和生命力给他很深的印象。菲利浦还说，最近许多中国观众陆续到他的住所——北京饭店访问他，他说：每当中国观众来访问我的时候，我就感到同中国更加接近了。这些中国观众们热情的眼睛，使我想起在巴黎国家人民剧院门前用同样眼光看我的法国观众们。
