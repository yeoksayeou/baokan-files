Because of my illness (heart disease), I was unable to attend this meeting, which I greatly regret! Now, I would like to offer my humble opinions for your consideration.

(1) On the issue of student grading in schools at all levels: Currently, schools use the Soviet "five-point system" for grading student academic performance. Based on preliminary investigations of the situation after its implementation, there are various opinions. Among parents, especially those of primary and secondary school students, some say, "Since the examination method has changed, students are not willing to study hard." Of course, this is the situation in Shanghai. When parents do not understand the actual situation within the school, this statement is certainly not reliable. There are also those engaged in practical school work, and their opinions are divided into positive and negative: some say this grading method is very good; others say that under the current situation of education in China, its implementation has many inconveniences. These are all real situations at present. I believe that although this matter is part of school education work, its impact is indeed not small. It is best to suggest that the government find a way to improve the solution: the Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education should organize a committee specifically to discuss this issue; or the two ministries can solicit opinions from schools at all levels across the country – regarding the situation after the implementation of the five-point system. After receiving various opinions, they should be sorted out separately, and a more practical situation and a better solution can be obtained.

(2) On the issue of implementing the "two-shift system" in primary and secondary schools: Currently, in order to expand the scope of education and enroll more students, the two-shift system is being implemented everywhere. As a result, students spend even less time being taught at school. At present, family education in our country is not yet ideal; social education is also not perfect. There are even more problems in the physical and mental development of children and young people. I believe that to make up for this deficiency, the following measures should be taken: ① In primary and secondary schools, the connection with students' families should be strengthened. It is best to select several teachers with good teaching results and rich experience from among the majority of teachers, reduce their teaching time, and have them be responsible for contacting families and guiding students on how to review their lessons at home. ② The education administration department should formulate a method – that is, a guidance method for students who do not attend classes under the two-shift system. Of course, this method should be adapted to local conditions and the times. ③ It is hoped that the Ministry of Education will pay special attention to this matter and study better and more appropriate methods to instruct various localities and schools at all levels.

(3) On the issue of social education for children and young people – which can also be said to be a social education issue: When students are not in school, in addition to being at home, they go to various aspects of society to engage in activities. In larger cities, such as parks, amusement parks, and cinemas, these are their usual places of activity. When engaging in activities, it is hoped that they can receive good education that is beneficial to their physical and mental health, which means that these places must also have educational guidance work. My meaning: it is best for the cultural and educational administration departments to be responsible for paying more attention to and guiding children and young people in these places. At the very least, select one or two or three employees with educational knowledge and abilities in each place to be specifically responsible for providing guidance to children and young people who come to play at any time and in any matter. I believe this is an effective method to turn uselessness into usefulness. I hope that the highest cultural and educational authorities can pay attention to this, formulate effective guidance methods, and allow various localities to carry them out. Even in small towns and rural areas, I think there must also be this need.

(4) On the issue of compiling dictionaries and character books: Speaking of this issue is relatively large! Can it be said that China's existing Ci Yuan, Ci Hai, as well as the older Kangxi Dictionary, and small dictionaries and specialized dictionaries that meet various needs, are already meeting current needs and are suitable for the current situation? I think it must not be. Then, we must pay attention to how to carry out this more important work. My opinion is that it is best to proceed in two aspects: ① Under the central planning and guidance, combine the strength of all aspects of the country to compile a "Great Chinese Dictionary" with richer and more complete content. It is divided into three parts: character form, character sound, and character meaning. The "form" part, from ancient to modern (ancient seal characters and modern simplified characters should be collected and arranged as much as possible), so that the viewer can see at a glance from ancient to modern. The "sound" part should list as many changes and different pronunciations from different eras and regions as possible, so that the reader can fully understand the various pronunciations of a character. The "meaning" part should also distinguish its original meaning, changed meaning, and special meanings in ancient and modern times, so that it can be known at a glance. Of course, this great work cannot be completed in a short period of time, but the government may as well make an effort. Also, regarding the interpretation of character meanings, the ancient annotations collected by previous character books, some of which belong to superstition and some of which are not in line with the times, can be adjusted and discarded on this occasion. ② In addition, general-purpose ordinary dictionaries and dictionaries can be simpler, and smaller ones can be compiled in a short period of time to supply various aspects. As for professional dictionaries of various kinds, experts in various fields can be allowed to compile them. As for this comprehensive dictionary and the small dictionaries for various applications (i.e., the above-mentioned first and second types), the central education and cultural authorities should bear this great responsibility.

    目前教育工作中的几个问题
    江恒源的发言
    此次开会，我因为在发病（心脏病）时期，不能出席，万分歉憾！现在，我愿把我的小小意见，提出来向诸位请教。
    （一）关于各级学校学生考试记分的问题：现在学校内学生学业考试的记分方法，皆是采取苏联的“五分制”。据各方面试行以后的情形略略考察，有各种不同的说法。在学生家长方面，尤其是中小学方面，有人这样说：“学校内因为考试方法变了，学生不肯用功了。”当然，这是上海的情况。在家长不明白学校内部实际情况下，这种说法当然不属可靠。也有从事学校实际工作的，他们的说法竟分正、反两种：有的说这种考试记分方法很好；有的说这种方法在中国教育现况下，实行起来却有许多不便。这皆是目前实在的情形。我以为这件事虽属学校教育工作的一部分，关系实在不算小。最好建议政府设法谋完善解决的办法：由高等教育部、教育部组织一个委员会专来讨论这个问题；也可由两部向全国各级学校分别征求意见——就五分制试行以后的情形，收到各种意见后，分别加以整理，当可得到较合于实际的情形，较好的办法。
    （二）关于中小学试行“二部制”的问题：现在为扩大教育范围，为多收学生起见，各处皆实行二部制。这样一来，学生在校受教的时间更少了。目前，我国家庭教育，还不能合于理想；社会教育方面，也不属完善。在儿童青年身心修养方面，问题就更多了。我以为要弥补这种缺陷，应当采取以下各种办法：①在中小学内，应加强和学生家庭的联系，最好就多数教师中推出几位教学效果好的、富有经验的，减少他们的授课时间，由他们负责和家庭联络，指导学生在家如何温习功课。②由教育行政方面，订出一种办法——即对于二部制不上课学生的指导办法。当然，这种办法应当因地制宜、因时制宜。③并望教育部对于这件事特别重视，能研究出较好、较适宜的办法，指示各地方和各级学校。
    （三）关于社会方面对儿童青年教育的问题——也可说是社会教育问题：学生不在学校，除在家庭外，便到社会各方面去活动。在较大都市里，如公园、游艺场、电影院等，皆是他们平常活动的场所。在活动时，希望能得着有益于身心的善良教育，这就不能不想到这些地方也要有带有教育性的指导工作了。我的意思：最好由文化教育行政方面负责，对于这些场所的儿童、青年注意多加指导。最少在每个场所选定一位或两三位具有教育知识能力的职员，专门负责对到场游玩的儿童、青年随时随事予以指导。我以为这是一种化无用为有用的有效办法。希望最高文化教育机关能注意及此，订出有效的指导办法，让各地去进行。就是小市镇、农村方面，我想一定也有这种需要的情形。
    （四）关于辞典、字书的编定的问题：说起这个问题可比较大了！我国已有的辞源、辞海、还有较老的康熙字典，又适应各种需要的小型字典、专门辞典等，能不能说是已适应目前需要，适合于目前的情形呢？我想一定不能吧。那末，这个较重大的工作，我们就不能不注意到如何进行了。我的意见，最好分两方面来进行：①在中央计划指导之下，结合全国各方面的力量，编成一部内容较丰富、较完整的“中华大辞典”。内分字形、字音、字义三部分。“形”的部分，由古到今（古篆体文及今简体字尽量搜罗排列），可使看的人，由古到今一目了然。“音”的部分，尽量罗列各时代、各地方的变迁不同的读音，使读的人对于一字的各种读音可以完全明了。“义”的部分，也分别它的原义、变迁义、古今各地的特殊义，也可一望即知。当然这一部大工作，不是短时间内可以完成的，但不妨由政府努力一下。还有在字义解释方面，从前所有字书搜罗的古代注解，有属于迷信的，有不合时代的，正可乘此机会分别调整、扬弃一番。②此外，一般应用的普通字典、辞典，尽可简单一点，在短时期内编成较小型的，供给各方面应用。至于专业性的各种辞典，尽可让各方面专家来编制。至于这种综合性的大辞典，及各方面应用的小字、辞典（即上述第一、二种），自应由中央教育文化机关负起这个大责任。
