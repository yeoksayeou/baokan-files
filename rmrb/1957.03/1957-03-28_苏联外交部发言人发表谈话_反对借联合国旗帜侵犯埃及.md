Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 27th: At a press conference held on March 26th by the Information Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Ilyichev, at the request of reporters, spoke about the entry of United Nations forces into the Gaza Strip. He said that it can be seen from newspaper reports that there are still attempts to turn the UN forces entering the Gaza area into an occupying force in order to interfere in Egypt's internal affairs and force the Egyptian government to make various concessions. The Soviet Union has always firmly opposed any attempt to make the UN forces assume functions that do not belong to it. The Soviet Union also believes that it is intolerable to use the UN flag to infringe upon the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Egypt or any other country.
At the press conference, Ilyichev also answered many questions raised by reporters regarding disarmament, the banning of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests, and other issues.
One reporter asked Ilyichev what his opinion was on some recent remarks in the Swedish press. These newspapers, based on some materials recently published by the Soviet Union regarding Swedish spies carrying out espionage activities in the Soviet Union, affirmed that the Soviet Union was attempting to worsen relations between the Soviet Union and Sweden, and that the Soviet Union's diplomatic policy towards Sweden had changed. Ilyichev said that the purpose of these remarks was obviously to deceive the Swedish public. The Soviet Union hopes that the Swedish authorities will take effective measures to prevent the occurrence of the above-mentioned activities, which will help improve relations between the two countries. The Soviet Union has always respected Sweden's policy of non-participation in military alliances. This policy is fully in line with the national interests of Sweden and is also an important factor for peace in Northern Europe. As for the future of relations between the Soviet Union and Sweden, the Soviet Union believes that there is a very good basis for further developing good-neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and Sweden. Of course, this requires both sides to have this desire.
One reporter said that some newspapers in Pakistan and the United States recently published news that there was a "secret agreement" between the Soviet Union and India regarding the Soviet Union's use of airports in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir and the arrival of Soviet "military advisers" in this state, as well as a "contract" for the Soviet Union to provide India with military supplies and equipment (including atomic weapons). The reporter asked Ilyichev what his opinion was on this issue. Ilyichev replied that these reports were fabricated. Their purpose is clearly to find an excuse to justify the war preparations being carried out on Pakistani territory, especially to create public opinion for the continued large-scale transportation of American weapons to Pakistan.

### 苏联外交部发言人发表谈话　反对借联合国旗帜侵犯埃及

　　苏联外交部发言人发表谈话
　　反对借联合国旗帜侵犯埃及
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：在苏联外交部新闻司3月26日举行的记者招待会上，苏联外交部发言人伊利切夫应记者的要求就联合国军队开入加沙地区一事发表了谈话。他说，从报纸消息中可以看出，现在仍然存在着把开入加沙地区的联合国军队变为占领军以干涉埃及内政和迫使埃及政府作各种让步的企图。苏联在过去和现在都坚决反对种种企图使联合国军队担当不属于它的职能的做法。苏联还认为，利用联合国旗帜来侵犯埃及和任何其他国家的领土的完整和主权，是不能容忍的。
    在这次招待会上，伊利切夫还回答了记者提出的许多关于裁军、禁止试验原子武器和氢武器及其他问题。
    有记者问伊利切夫，他对一些瑞典报纸最近一些言论有什么意见。这些报纸根据苏联最近发表了瑞典间谍在苏联进行间谍活动的某些材料而肯定地作出判断说，苏联企图使苏联同瑞典的关系恶化，苏联对瑞典的外交方针的立场有所改变。伊利切夫说，这种言论的目的显然是想蒙骗瑞典公众。苏联希望瑞典当局采取有效措施防止上述活动的发生，才能有助于两国关系的改善。苏联一向尊重瑞典不参加军事联盟的政策。这种政策完全符合瑞典的民族利益，而且也是北欧和平的重要因素。至于苏联和瑞典关系的前途，苏联认为，在进一步发展苏联和瑞典的睦邻关系方面有着很好的基础，当然，这须要双方都有这种愿望。
    有一个记者说，最近巴基斯坦和美国的一些报纸刊登消息说，苏联和印度之间有着关于苏联使用印度查谟和克什米尔邦地区的机场以及苏联“军事顾问”来到这个邦的“秘密协定”以及苏联给印度提供军需品和军备（包括原子武器）的“合同”。记者问伊利切夫对这个问题有什么意见。伊利切夫回答说，这些消息都是捏造的。其目的显然是想找一种借口来替在巴基斯坦领土上进行的战争准备作辩护，特别是为继续大量往巴基斯坦运美国武器这种作法制造舆论。
