A few days before Song Guixiang, representative to the National Model Agricultural Laborers Conference, came to Beijing, I interviewed her. This 37-year-old rural woman was the first in Luan Chuan County, Henan Province, to respond to the Party's call and bravely chose the livestock breeding profession that others were unwilling to engage in. Now, she is the head of the livestock breeding station of the Beigou Agricultural Cooperative in Miaozi Township.

Luan Chuan County is located at the foot of Funiu Mountain. In the past, a widespread view in this area was that livestock breeding was the most "despicable" profession. Therefore, in 1951, when the local Communist Party committee and government called on everyone to improve livestock breeds in preparation for using new agricultural implements, many people were unwilling to engage in livestock selection and breeding. However, Song Guixiang volunteered to sign up. Song Guixiang and her husband, Lao Jiang, both came from poor peasant families. They believed that improving livestock breeds was one of the ways to change the poor face of the mountainous area, which would benefit everyone, and they should take the lead. So, Lao Jiang helped her buy a breeding bull with a tall body and strong limbs from Nanyang, a cattle-producing area. Later, Lao Jiang was away, and Song Guixiang did the breeding work alone.

Song Guixiang's work in livestock breeding caused a lot of discussion among neighbors near and far. Many people said: Why does this family, who doesn't lack food or drink, do this dirty work! Some people simply satirized Song Guixiang in person; some even ridiculed her with abusive words and cursed her behind her back. Even her eight or nine-year-old children were subjected to boring teasing by their classmates at school. This caused Song Guixiang great mental pain. Speaking of the situation at the time, she said: "I almost couldn't bear it!" However, with the comfort and encouragement of the leaders of the county and district at the time, she finally overcame the old concept of being afraid of "losing face" and persisted.

Doing livestock breeding work, due to unfamiliarity with the business, there were many difficulties for Song Guixiang. In the past, she had not only not done breeding work, but had not even seen it. In this case, she humbly learned and inquired from the old farmers, carefully observed the habits and reactions of the livestock, and collected people's opinions to strive to do a good job. In this way, she finally became a capable breeding worker. In a very short period of time, the conception rate of female animals greatly increased. By the end of 1951, all the bred female animals were pregnant.

In the process of becoming familiar with the business, feeding livestock was a very heavy task. She loved this breeding animal as much as she loved her own child. She fed the livestock "on time and in quantity" and arranged the livestock's life very regularly. In order to keep the livestock clean all year round, she scraped and swept the livestock's body every morning. When it was cold, she did not let the livestock drink a drop of cold water. When summer came, she built a shed for the livestock to cool off in the shade, and sometimes pulled them to the river to bathe and relieve the heat. Due to her long-term patient feeding, her livestock has always been very healthy and fat, and has not had a single illness to this day.

As time passed, under the influence of Song Guixiang's practical actions, people's contempt for feeding breeding animals gradually changed. The yellow cattle bred by Song Guixiang's breeding animals were growing, attracting people to improve livestock breeds. Many people began to voluntarily do breeding work. Song Guixiang also helped everyone to carry out this work. A farmer surnamed Dang near Luan Chuan City bought a Nanyang yellow cattle, but it became thin because he did not know how to feed it. He sent it to Song Guixiang's house for help. Song Guixiang fed the cattle until it was fat before letting the farmer take it back. Chen Xiaowa in Sidaogou Village also fed a breeding bull, but his wife "felt ashamed" and wanted a divorce. Song Guixiang invited his wife to her home and used her own personal experience to help his wife correct her wrong understanding. Chen Xiaowa also happily started doing livestock breeding work.

From 1951 to the present, 428 livestock have been bred by Song Guixiang's breeding animals. These livestock have large bodies and are strong in plowing, and the farmers are all satisfied; Song Guixiang also has a high reputation among the farmers.

Song Guixiang joined the agricultural cooperative in 1955. The cooperative specifically established a livestock breeding station and elected her as the head. Now, the breeding station has grown to four people, with two breeding bulls, and is preparing to buy another breeding pig to help everyone breed piglets. This year, the breeding station has signed breeding contracts with more than 80 units and is prepared to continue to help agricultural cooperatives improve livestock breeds.

    牲畜配种站的女站长
    ——访全国农业劳动模范代表会议代表宋桂香
    新华社记者  扈庄
    全国农业劳动模范代表会议代表宋桂香来北京的前几天，记者访问了她。这位三十七岁的农村妇女，在河南省栾川县内首先响应党的号召，勇敢地选择了别人所不愿从事的牲畜配种这个职业。现在，她是庙子乡北沟农业社牲畜配种站的站长。
    栾川县位于伏牛山下，这个地区过去广泛地流行着一种观念：牲畜配种是一种最“下贱”的职业。因此，1951年当地中共党委和政府为了准备使用新农具号召大家改良牲畜品种的时候，许多人都不愿意从事牲畜选种配种这种职业。但是，宋桂香却自告奋勇地报名参加了。宋桂香和她丈夫老姜都是出身于贫苦的农民家庭。他们认为：改良牲畜品种，是改变山区贫穷面貌的办法之一，这对大家有好处，自己应该带头干。于是，老姜帮她到黄牛的产地——南阳买回了一条体躯高大、四肢粗壮的种牛，以后，老姜在外，宋桂香就一个人来作配种工作了。
    宋桂香作牲畜配种这件事，曾引起远远近近许许多多乡邻们的议论，许多人都说：她这个不缺吃不缺喝的人家为什么要作这种脏活呢！有的人简直就在宋桂香面前讽刺她；有的更是恶言恶语地嘲笑她，背后骂她。连她只有八、九岁的孩子在学校读书时都引起同学们无聊的戏弄。这使宋桂香精神上感到极大的痛苦。她谈到当时的情形时说：“简直就有些支架不住！”但是，当时她在县、区领导上的安慰、鼓动下，终于战胜了怕“丢人”的旧观念，坚持下来了。
    做牲畜配种工作，由于业务不熟，对宋桂香来说，困难是很多的。过去她不但没有作过配种工作，连看也没有看到过。在这种情况下，她便虚心地向老农学习和询问，细心地观察牲畜的习性和反应，并且搜集人们的意见，力求做好工作。就这样，她终于成为一个能干的配种人员了。在很短的时间内，母畜受胎率大大提高，到1951年年底，所有配种的母畜便都怀了胎。
    她在这个熟悉业务的过程中，喂养牲畜是一个非常繁重的工作。她像爱护自己的孩子一样爱护这条种畜。她喂牲畜做到“定时定量”，把牲畜的生活安排得非常有规律。为了使牲畜身上终年保持清洁，每天早晨都要将牲畜的身上刮刮扫扫，天冷时，不让牲畜饮一口冷水，夏天到来了，她给牲畜搭个凉棚，让牲畜在浓荫下乘凉，有时并拉到河中洗澡去暑。由于她的长期耐心喂养，她的牲畜一直非常健胖，到现在没有闹过一次病。
    时间一天天地过去了，在宋桂香实际行动的影响下，人们鄙视喂养种畜的观念渐渐改变了。由宋桂香的种畜配种所繁殖的黄牛在成长着，吸引着人们要求改良牲畜品种。许许多多的人都开始自愿作配种工作。宋桂香并帮助大家开展这一工作。栾川城附近一家姓党的农民，买了一头南阳黄牛，因为不会喂养变瘦了，送到宋桂香家里请求帮助，宋桂香一直把这条牛喂得肥肥胖胖的，才让这位农民牵回去。四道沟村陈小娃也喂了一头种牛，但他的老婆“嫌丢人”，闹着要离婚。宋桂香便把他老婆请到自己家里来，用自己的亲身体会，帮助他老婆纠正了错误认识，陈小娃也乐呵呵地作起牲畜配种工作来了。
    从1951年到现在，经宋桂香的种畜配种繁殖的牲畜已有四百二十八头。这些牲畜体躯硕大，耕地有力，农民个个满意；宋桂香也在农民中有了很高的声誉。
    宋桂香在1955年就参加了农业社，社里专门成立了牲畜配种站，选她当站长。如今，这个配种站已经发展为四个人，有二条种牛，并准备再买一头种猪，帮助大家繁殖仔猪。今年，这个配种站已和八十多个单位订了配种合同，准备继续帮助各农业社改良牲畜品种。
