Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, March 6th: The most solemn religious festival in Tibet, the Great Prayer Festival (传召大会), began in Lhasa on the 5th. In the Jokhang Temple (大昭寺) in the city center, tens of thousands of lamas began gathering before dawn. According to traditional customs, the lamas will hold six gatherings in this temple every day. More than 20,000 lamas have come from nearby monasteries in Lhasa and from afar. Coupled with farmers and herdsmen from all over Tibet and Buddhists from Sichuan, Qinghai and other places who came to participate in the Great Prayer Festival, the population of Lhasa has nearly doubled in a few days.

　　People participating in the Great Prayer Festival walk and pray around the Jokhang Temple during the intervals between gatherings, making the usually bustling streets of Lhasa appear exceptionally quiet.

　　"传召 (Chuánzhào)" in Tibetan is "莫朗青布 (Molang Qinbu)," meaning Prayer Assembly, and the festival lasts for twenty-one days. According to legend, the "Great Prayer Festival" originated in the era of Tsongkhapa (崇喀巴), the founder of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism. This year's Great Prayer Festival will be presided over by the Gaden Tripa (噶丹寺赤巴) (abbot of Gaden Monastery) because the 14th Dalai Lama is not in Lhasa.

    西藏最隆重的宗教节期
    传召大会开始举行
    新华社拉萨6日电　拉萨在5日开始举行西藏最隆重的宗教节期——传召大会。在市中心的大昭寺里，上万的喇嘛从拂晓前就开始了集会。按照传统习惯，喇嘛们每天将在这个寺庙里举行六次集会。从拉萨附近寺院和远道赶来的喇嘛已经有二万多人，加上西藏各地前来参加传召的农、牧民和四川、青海等地来到这里的佛教徒，在几天内使拉萨市区的人口增加将近一倍。
    参加传召的人们，在集会的空隙时间环绕着大昭寺边行走边祈祷，平日热闹的拉萨街头显得异常静穆。
      “传召”藏名“莫朗青布”，意为祈祷大会，会期二十一天。据传说：“传召大会”起始于喇嘛教的黄教祖师崇喀巴时代。今年的传召大会，由于十四世达赖喇嘛未在拉萨，将由噶丹寺赤巴（法台）主持。
