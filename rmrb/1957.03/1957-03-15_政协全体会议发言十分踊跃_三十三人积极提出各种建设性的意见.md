    Sangre Gyatso introduced the main achievements and experiences of ethnic minority education work in Qinghai Province.

    Feng Youlan said that "Let a hundred flowers bloom" does not mean "a hundred schools of thought coexist peacefully." There must be debate between different views on the same issue.

He also specifically introduced the work of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in carrying out the socialist transformation of the animal husbandry economy.

    Cai Fangyin, Deputy Director of the Building Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, believes that in order to enable China's socialist construction to gradually improve people's living standards, the appropriate ratio of investment in heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture needs to be carefully considered, and this ratio should be gradually reduced.

They believe that the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland have a responsibility to help Tibetan compatriots carry out construction and improve their material and cultural living standards. To develop Tibet's economy and culture, it must be carried out gradually in accordance with Tibet's actual conditions, and should be carried out independently by the Tibetan local government. At the same time, the customs and habits of the Tibetan people and their freedom of religious belief should be respected.

In his speech, he outlined the development of China's agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production problems last year.
