    Threats to Peace and Security in Asia
    The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) Council held a meeting in Canberra, the capital of Australia, to discuss strengthening the military structure of SEATO, decided to establish a permanent military planning office in Bangkok, and plans to conduct three or four large-scale joint naval exercises in Southeast Asia this year. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles threatened after the meeting that the United States would use atomic weapons in the SEATO region if military action occurred. At the same time, according to India's "Delhi Times," the U.S. government is currently conducting secret negotiations with some Asian countries regarding the stationing of U.S. special atomic forces in Asian countries. These activities of the American aggressor group show that it is trying to continue to push its bankrupt "strength" policy in Asia, in order to create tension and threaten peace and security in Asia.
    During the Canberra meeting, Dulles repeatedly repeated the cliché of the "communist threat" and did everything possible to slander and attack the Chinese people. Dulles's disregard for facts, and his upside-down clamoring, had one purpose: to use this to stabilize this increasingly unstable aggressive group; another purpose was to try to cover up the United States' aggressive activities in Asia, to provoke friendly relations between the people of Asian countries and the Chinese people, and to intimidate Asian countries so that the United States could carry out aggression in Asia with impunity. Unfortunately, Dulles's wishful thinking has failed again, and his speech was not only disgusted by Asian countries, but also met with a cold response from other member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty. Even the American "Washington Post and Times Herald" believed that Dulles "did something stupid." The newspaper said that Dulles's "unrealistic" attacks "are unlikely to change the original attitude of many neutral countries and support his cause." This is because the pursuit of a peaceful and neutral policy by Asian countries is based on their national interests, and cannot be based on Dulles's likes and dislikes.
    No matter how hard Dulles tries, the fact that the United States is trying to step up its interference and aggression against Asian countries cannot be covered up. On the eve of the SEATO Council meeting, Dulles publicly expressed his "concern" about the situation in Indonesia and attempted to take advantage of the difficulties faced by the Indonesian people to use SEATO to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs. The meeting also specifically discussed how to deal with neutralism in Southeast Asian countries. Philippine representative Garcia openly advocated "launching a movement against neutral countries" in the discussion. According to him, doing so "may be beneficial to SEATO member states." Based on this opinion, the Canberra meeting made specific arrangements to use so-called strengthening of military forces to intimidate and threaten neutral Asian countries. In order to encourage so-called "scholars" from SEATO countries "to engage in investigation and research work in fields specifically related to SEATO," the meeting also decided to establish a "scholarship" program. In fact, this is a U.S. spy agency aimed at stepping up subversive activities against Asian countries.
    Among the eight member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, only Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines are Asian member states. The facts since the establishment of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization more than two years ago show that participation in this military group is extremely detrimental to these three Asian member states themselves. The United States has dragged these Asian countries into its military group in order to force them to act as American tools of aggression, so it always tries every means to control them. Any event in these countries that does not conform to the interests of the United States will be subject to the United States's crude interference. The recent anti-government incident after the Thai general election is one example. The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok openly distributed leaflets in the capital of a SEATO Asian member state, inciting anti-government marches and demonstrations. These facts clearly show that participation in the U.S. military group is fundamentally incompatible with the sovereignty, independence, and national interests of Asian countries. In recent years, voices calling for withdrawal from the Southeast Asia aggressive group have emerged in Thailand and Pakistan, which is completely understandable.
    Similarly, it will not be beneficial for countries such as Britain and France, which are being squeezed out by the United States everywhere, to follow the United States's policy of strength. In fact, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is only a tool of the United States, and the United States always forces other countries to act according to its policies. At this Canberra meeting, Dulles attempted to turn the United States's adventurous policy towards China into the policy of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which cannot but create divisions and contradictions among some member states of this treaty organization.
    Asian countries that have already gained independence and are striving for national independence are emerging as a powerful force for peace on the world stage. Demanding peaceful coexistence, opposing the threat of war, demanding national independence, and opposing colonialism have become an irresistible trend in the historical development of Asia. Any attempt by American aggressors to obstruct this trend will be futile.

### 对亚洲和平和安全的威胁

    对亚洲和平和安全的威胁
    东南亚条约组织理事会在澳大利亚首都堪培拉举行会议，讨论了加强东南亚条约组织的军事机构问题，决定在曼谷增设一个永久性的军事计划处，并准备今年要在东南亚地区实行三次或四次大规模联合海军演习。美国国务卿杜勒斯在会后扬言说，美国在东南亚条约组织地区如果遇有军事行动，就要使用原子武器。同时，据印度“德里时报”报道，美国政府目前正在同亚洲某些国家，就美国特种原子部队驻在亚洲国家的问题进行秘密谈判。美国侵略集团的这些活动表明，它正力图在亚洲继续推行它早已破产了的“实力”政策，以制造紧张局势，威胁亚洲的和平和安全。
    在堪培拉会议期间，杜勒斯一再重复“共产主义威胁”的滥调，并百般诽谤和攻击中国人民。杜勒斯这样不顾事实、颠倒黑白地乱叫乱喊，一个目的是想借此安定一下这个日益不稳的侵略集团；另一个目的是企图掩饰美国在亚洲的侵略活动，挑拨亚洲各国人民同中国人民之间的友好关系，恫吓亚洲国家，以便美国能在亚洲放手进行侵略。但不幸的是，杜勒斯的如意算盘又落了空，他的发言不仅为亚洲国家所厌恶，而且东南亚条约其他成员国家的反应也很冷淡。就连美国的“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”也认为杜勒斯“做了一件傻事”。这个报纸说，杜勒斯“脱离实际”的攻击，“不可能使许多中立国家改变他们原来的态度而支持他的事业。”这是因为亚洲各国奉行和平中立政策，是出于它们国家的民族利益的考虑，而不可能是根据杜勒斯的好恶。
    不管杜勒斯怎样煞费苦心，美国力图加紧干涉和侵略亚洲各国的事实是掩盖不住的。就在东南亚条约组织理事会召开前夕，杜勒斯曾公开表示对印度尼西亚局势的“关切”，并企图乘印度尼西亚人民面临困难的时机，利用东南亚条约组织干涉印度尼西亚的内政。这次会议还专门讨论了如何对付东南亚各国的中立主义问题。菲律宾代表加西亚在讨论中公开主张“进行一个反对中立国家的运动”。据他说，这样做“可能对东南亚条约成员国有好处”。根据这个意见，堪培拉会议做了具体安排，决定要用所谓加强军事力量对亚洲中立国家进行恐吓和威胁。为了鼓励东南亚条约国家的所谓“学者”“在与东南亚条约组织特别有关的领域中从事调查和研究工作”，会上还决定设立“奖学金”计划。实际上这是美国的特务间谍机构，旨在加紧对亚洲国家的颠复活动。
    东南亚条约集团八个成员国中，亚洲成员国只有巴基斯坦、泰国和菲律宾三个国家。东南亚条约组织成立两年多以来的事实说明，参加这个军事集团，对于这三个亚洲成员国本身也是极其不利的。美国把这几个亚洲国家拉入它的军事集团，就是为了强迫它们充当美国的侵略工具，因此它总是想尽办法控制它们。在这些国家里发生任何不符合美国利益的事情，都会遭到美国的粗暴干涉。最近，泰国大选后发生的反政府事件就是一例。美国驻曼谷大使馆竟在东南亚条约组织的亚洲成员国首都公然散发传单，煽动反政府的游行示威。这些事实清楚地说明，参加美国军事集团，同亚洲国家的主权独立和民族利益是根本不相容的。近年来在泰国和巴基斯坦国内都出现了要求退出东南亚侵略集团的呼声，这是完全可以理解的。
    同样的，到处遭受美国排挤的英法等国追随美国的实力政策，对它们本身也不会有什么好处。事实上，东南亚条约组织只是美国的工具，美国总是强迫别的国家按照它的政策行事。在这次堪培拉会议上，杜勒斯就企图把美国对中国的冒险政策变为东南亚条约组织的政策，这就不能不造成这个条约组织的某些成员国之间的分歧和矛盾。
    已经获得独立和正在争取民族独立的亚洲国家，正作为一种强大的和平力量出现在世界舞台。要求和平共处，反对战争威胁，要求民族独立，反对殖民主义，已经成为亚洲历史发展中不可阻遏的趋势。美国侵略者阻挠这个趋势的任何企图都将是徒劳的。
