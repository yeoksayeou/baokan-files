A Female Lawyer Who Upholds the Truth - Huang Huilian
Xinhua News Agency Reporter Fang Ling, Yu Xigui

    When we visited the young female lawyer Huang Huilian, she was in the civil court of the People's Court of Heping District, Tianjin, acting as a pro bono agent for a deaf-mute woman in a divorce case. During the debate, her brief and serious statement forcefully defended the legitimate interests of the mother and child she represented. She pointed out that the man had failed to fulfill his obligations as a husband for more than a year; he did not even bear the medical expenses when his wife was suffering from lung disease; and he unreasonably refused to allow the woman to take back the property she deserved after the divorce, threatening her to hand over the only child who had been living with her since the separation. Based on the provisions of the Marriage Law, Huang Huilian refuted the man's unreasonable demands and requested the judge to protect the interests of this mother and child living in poverty and disease. When the translator told the woman this in sign language, a smile appeared on her thin face, and she kept waving her thumb at Huang Huilian.

    Two years ago, Huang Huilian was still a college student who had just graduated from the specialized course of Beijing College of Political Science and Law. This overseas Chinese girl from Vietnam said that her progress was the result of the training of the Communist Party and the people. She said: When I first graduated from school, I would blush when speaking in front of many people; I would even panic when I saw the parties involved crying in court. The Party and comrades gave me a lot of encouragement and helped me go deep into the masses to understand their lives and demands. This made me deeply feel the meaning of serving the people wholeheartedly and increased my courage to overcome difficulties.

    But for this new lawyer, there were still many difficulties. Not long after she officially became a lawyer, she encountered a homicide case – a truck from Tanggu "ran over" a person. The family of the deceased accused the driver Zhang Jitao of seriously violating traffic regulations, exceeding the speed limit, and having faulty brakes, resulting in the person being "run over" to death. These issues were indeed difficult for Huang Huilian, the defense counsel who was not familiar with automobile construction and driving technology. She went to the factory where the driver Zhang Jitao worked and the Tianjin Automobile Repair Factory, which was repairing the car, to visit technicians and some veteran drivers, carefully learned about Zhang Jitao's inspection of the car before departure, the time of departure and the accident, the distance between the departure point and the factory, and studied various relevant materials such as on-site photos and hospital diagnoses of the deceased. She discovered that this veteran driver with more than 20 years of experience who had never had an accident had carefully checked all parts of the car before departure, and the speed did not exceed the regulations. The accident was caused by the explosion of the car's throttle. At the same time, it was discovered that the deceased did not comply with traffic regulations and was riding a bicycle with no front brakes and faulty rear brakes at high speed in the fast lane dedicated to motor vehicles, so the deceased also had certain responsibilities. In a public trial court with more than 800 people in attendance, Huang Huilian defended the defendant based on these facts, so that he was given a lighter punishment. When leaving the court, many people ran over from the audience to greet Huang Huilian.

    From this criminal case defense, she deeply realized that in-depth investigation and research and relying on the masses are the best keys to opening the door to difficulties.

    In her work, Huang Huilian never flinches in order to safeguard the interests of the people and the dignity of the law. Once, she represented the housing dispute case between citizen Du Yaqin and Li Heqing. Li Heqing and his son Li Shuji sold the house to Du Yaqin. After receiving the money, not only did they not move out, but Li Shuji also falsely accused Du Yaqin of constantly urging them to move, which made his father sick; they not only wanted to swallow the money, but also attempted to threaten her to pay another compensation fee, scaring Du Yaqin, who did not understand the law, to the point of not daring to go out. When Huang Huilian represented Du Yaqin in court, Li Shuji launched a personal attack on this female lawyer. After the court adjourned, he stood guard at the entrance of the court to intimidate her, and also wrote to the Tianjin Legal Advisory Office saying that Huang Huilian was "violating laws and regulations and losing her position." All of this did not affect Huang Huilian's confidence in upholding the truth. During the second trial, she used many facts that she had investigated to expose Li Shuji's bad behavior on the spot, so that the case received a fair trial.

    Huang Huilian works bravely and diligently to safeguard the national legal system. Even on Sundays, she often goes to the homes of people she has represented or defended to see if there are any difficulties in the execution of court judgments, and at the same time explains the law to women and promotes the superiority of the lawyer system. Or she stays in the legal advisory office to help the lawyers on duty receive visiting people. In order to investigate evidence, she often rushes around in the wind and rain, writing materials until late at night when she returns. Last summer, when she went out to investigate, she fainted twice on the way due to the heat, but after a short rest, she insisted on working and never complained. Many people who have been helped by her often come to thank her or write letters to express their gratitude; some have repeatedly asked her to dinner and give her gifts, but she has politely declined them. She often tells others: "It is the duty and responsibility of a lawyer to safeguard the legitimate interests of the people."

    In the year or so that Huang Huilian has been working as a lawyer, she has represented and defended more than 120 criminal and civil cases, without making a single major mistake. Many people praise her as a good lawyer of the people.

    坚持真理的女律师——黄惠莲
    新华社记者  方凌  虞锡圭
    当我们访问年轻的女律师黄惠莲的时候，她正在天津市和平区人民法院的民事审判庭上，为一个离婚案件中的聋哑妇女作义务代理人。在辩论时，她那简要而严肃的申述，有力地维护了被代理的母子的合法利益。她指出男方在最近一年多以来，一直没有尽到做丈夫的义务；甚至在妻子受着肺病的折磨时，连医药费都不承担；还无理地不准女方在离婚后拿回自己应得的财产，威胁女方将分居以来一直跟着她生活的独生子交给他。黄惠莲根据婚姻法的规定，驳斥了男方的无理要求，提请审判员维护这个生活在贫病交加中的母子的利益。当翻译将这番话用手势告诉女方时，她那清瘦的脸上泛起笑容，并且不停地向黄惠莲摇摆着大拇指。
    两年以前，黄惠莲还是一个刚从北京政法学院专修科毕业的大学生。这位来自越南的华侨姑娘谈起自己的进步时，一开头就说这是共产党和人民培养的结果。她说：当我刚从学校毕业时，当着许多人讲话都要脸红；甚至在法庭上一见当事人流泪，自己也就心慌起来。党和同志们给我许多鼓励，帮助我深入群众，了解他们的生活和要求。使我深深地感到忠心耿耿地为人民服务的意义，增加了克服困难的勇气。
    但是对这个新律师来说，困难毕竟是不少的。在她刚刚正式担任律师工作不久，就遇到一件人命案子——来自塘沽的一辆载重汽车“轧”死了人。死者家属控诉司机张继涛严重的违犯交通规则，超过了规定速度，刹车又不灵，以致把人“轧”死。这些问题，对于不熟悉汽车构造和驾驶技术的被告辩护人黄惠莲来说，确实够难的。她深入到司机张继涛所在的工厂和正在承修这部汽车的天津汽车修理厂，访问技术工人和一些老司机，仔细了解张继涛出发前对汽车的检修情况、发车和出事的时间、出车地点同工厂的距离，研究了现场照片和医院对死者的诊断书等各种有关资料，发现这个有二十多年经验、从未出过事故的老司机，在发车前对汽车各部都作了仔细的检查，速度也没有超过规定，发生事故是由于汽车油门的爆炸而引起的。同时发现死者不遵守交通规则，在专供机动车行驶的快车道上骑着没有前闸、后闸不灵的自行车急驶，所以死者也有一定的责任。在一个有八百多人旁听的公审法庭上，黄惠莲根据这些事实替被告作了辩护，使他得到从轻处理。退庭时，许多人从旁听席上跑过来向黄惠莲致意。
    从这次刑事案件的辩护中，她深深地体会到深入调查研究和依靠群众，是打开困难之门的最好的钥匙。
    黄惠莲在工作中，为了维护人民的利益和法律的尊严，从不畏缩。有一次她代理了市民杜雅琴和李和卿的房屋纠纷案件。李和卿和他的儿子李树基将房子卖给了杜雅琴，在收了房钱以后，不但不让出房子，李树基还诬告杜雅琴经常催他们搬家而把他的父亲气出病来；不仅想吞噬这笔房钱，还企图威胁她再出一笔赔偿费，把不懂法律的杜雅琴吓得不敢出门。黄惠莲在代理杜雅琴出庭时，李树基对这位女律师进行了人身攻击，在退庭后还守在法院门口威吓她，同时还给天津市法律顾问处写信说黄惠莲“违法乱纪、失去立场”。这一切都没有影响黄惠莲坚持真理的信心。在第二次开审时，她用调查到的许多事实，当场揭穿了李树基的恶劣行为，使这个案子得到了公正的裁判。
    黄惠莲就是这样勇敢而勤恳地为维护国家法制而工作着。即便是星期天，她还常到她所代理或辩护过的人家去，看看在执行法院判决中有没有困难，同时向妇女们讲解法律和宣传律师制度的优越性。或者留在法律顾问处，帮助值班律师接待来访的群众。她为了调查证据，经常风雨无阻地在外面奔忙，晚上回来写材料直到深夜。去年夏天，在她出外调查情况时，曾热得两次昏倒在途中，但休息一会后又坚持工作，从不叫苦。许多经过她帮助的人常常登门向她道谢，或写信来向她表示感激；有的还再三请她去吃饭，给她送礼，但都被她婉言谢绝了。她常常对别人说：“维护人民的合法利益是律师的义务和责任。”
    黄惠莲在担任律师工作的一年多以来，共代理和辩护了一百二十多个刑事和民事案件，没有出过一次大差错。许多人赞扬她是人民的好律师。
