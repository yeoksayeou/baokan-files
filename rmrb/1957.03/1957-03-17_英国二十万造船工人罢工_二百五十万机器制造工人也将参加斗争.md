Xinhua News Agency, London, March 16th: After their demand for a 10% wage increase was rejected, 200,000 British shipyard workers walked off the job together at noon today. This is the largest strike in Britain since the 1926 general strike.

The strike has brought the construction and repair of four to five million tons of ships in Britain to a standstill. This includes sixty-three oil tankers currently being built, which Britain desperately needs.

The British government, facing fierce competition from Japan and West Germany in shipbuilding, appeared panicked. Last night, British Prime Minister Macmillan instructed Labor Minister Macleod to quell the brewing strike wave at the last minute. Subsequently, Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation Watkinson also loudly proclaimed that the cessation of shipbuilding work would only benefit Britain's foreign competitors.

Today's strike is just the first stage. Representatives of the executive committees of the forty unions affiliated with the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions decided yesterday that 2.5 million machine manufacturing workers will also join the major strike on March 23rd. This will severely impact industries that produce 40% of Britain's main exports.

    英国二十万造船工人罢工
    二百五十万机器制造工人也将参加斗争
    新华社16日讯　伦敦消息：英国二十万造船工人，在他们的提高工资10％的要求遭到拒绝以后，今天中午一起放下了手头的工作。这是英国自从1926年总罢工以来最大一次的罢工。
    这次罢工已经使得英国四、五百万吨船只的制造和修理工作陷于停顿状态。这里面有正在制造的六十三艘英国目前最需要的油船。
    在造船工业方面遭到日本和西德剧烈竞争的英国政府表现得惊慌万状。昨天晚上，英国首相麦克米伦指示劳工大臣麦克里奥德要在最后一分钟内把酝酿中的罢工浪潮平息下去。接着，交通与民航大臣沃金森也大声叫嚷造船工作的停顿只会有利于英国的外国竞争者。
    今天的罢工还只是第一个阶段。英国造船工人及机械工业工人工会联合会所属的四十个工会执行委员会的代表昨天又决定，二百五十万机器制造工人也将在3月23日参加这一大罢工。这将使生产40％的英国主要出口产品的工业遭受严重的影响。
