Wuhu Tea Farmers Busy with Production

    (By Our Correspondent) This newspaper reports that the Wuhu Special District, famous for producing high-quality teas such as "Qihong," "Tunlv," "Maofeng," and "Houkui," is actively preparing for spring tea production, striving for a bumper tea harvest this year.

    Last winter, tea farmers actively cultivated and fertilized tea plants. The Changtan Tea Agricultural Production Cooperative in She County, a national model for increased agricultural production, had 60% of its labor force engaged in manure collection and fertilization in mid-December of last year, applying approximately 1,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of tea garden.

    To improve tea quality and save labor, Qimen County convened thirty woodworking, bricklaying, and bamboo-working technicians in October of last year to study and practice improving the shortcomings of tea rolling machines, Sha Qing (kill-green) machines, and other primary processing tools. Later, the County Handicraft Industry Cooperative and agricultural science and technology extension stations in various districts sent personnel to contact agricultural production cooperatives in various places to determine that there were two hundred primary processing machines to be repaired, and also signed contracts to add one hundred and twenty machines.

    For famous teas such as Huangshan's top-grade "Maofeng" and Taiping's "Houkui," the method of special pre-purchase agreements with each cooperative and household will be adopted, and the deposit will also be appropriately increased.

    Supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of the special district are also arranging the supply of chemical fertilizers. (Du Guoliang)

    芜湖茶农生产忙
    本报讯  盛产名茶“祁红”“屯绿”“毛峰”和“猴魁”的芜湖专区，正在积极进行春茶生产准备工作，争取今年茶叶大丰收。
    去年冬天，茶农们就积极对茶棵培土施肥。全国农业增产模范社歙县长潭茶叶社，在去年12月中旬，每天有60％的劳动力从事积肥和施肥工作，平均每亩茶园约上了一千斤。
    为了提高茶叶质量和节省劳动力，去年10月祁门县就召集了三十名木、砖、竹业技工，研究和实习改进揉茶机、杀青机等初制工具所存在的缺点，以后又由县手工业联社和各区农业科学技术推广站等单位派人同各地农业生产合作社联系，摸清待修的各种初制机器有二百架，并且还签订了添置一百二十架机器的合同。
    对黄山特级“毛峰”和太平“猴魁”等名茶，将采取逐社逐户特约预购的方式，定金也将适当增加。
    该专区各地的供销社，也正在安排化学肥料供应工作。（杜国梁）
