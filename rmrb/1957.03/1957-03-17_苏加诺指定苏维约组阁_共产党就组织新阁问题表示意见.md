Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 16th: President Sukarno announced to reporters at the Independence Palace last night that he had designated Suwirjo, Chairman of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, as the formateur of the new cabinet.

Sukarno said that he wanted Suwirjo to form a cabinet capable of taking firm and correct steps, and that this cabinet should also establish a National Council in accordance with his plan. The cabinet should be formed within the shortest possible time.

According to Antara News Agency, after Suwirjo was designated as the formateur of the new cabinet, the Indonesian Nationalist Party and the Nahdatul Ulama held a joint meeting.

On the 15th, the delegation of the Indonesian Communist Party expressed its views to President Sukarno on the issue of forming a new cabinet, saying that if the newly formed cabinet is centered on the Indonesian Nationalist Party and the Nahdatul Ulama, then whether or not the Indonesian Communist Party participates in the cabinet is not a problem; if the Masyumi Party participates in the cabinet, then the Indonesian Communist Party will demand the formation of a cooperative cabinet as proposed in Sukarno's plan.

President Sukarno explained the current national situation to the delegation of the Indonesian Communist Party, including Aidit, whom he had invited, and hoped that the Indonesian Communist Party could assist in overcoming the current difficulties.

Regarding the issue of military martial law, the delegation said that the Indonesian Communist Party believes that due to the worrying domestic situation, the integrity of the Republic being threatened, and subversive activities intensifying, it is necessary to declare a state of emergency throughout the country; however, if the country has regained its integrity and foreign subversive activities have been thwarted, then normal state should be restored immediately.

    苏加诺指定苏维约组阁
    共产党就组织新阁问题表示意见
    据新华社雅加达16日电　苏加诺总统昨天晚上在独立宫向新闻记者宣布，他已经指定印度尼西亚国民党总主席苏维约为新阁组阁人。
    苏加诺说，他要苏维约组织一个能够采取坚决和正确的步骤的内阁，这个内阁并且要能按照他的方案成立民族委员会。这个内阁应在最短期间内组成。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，在苏维约被指定为新阁组阁人以后，印度尼西亚国民党和伊斯兰教师联合会举行了联席会议。
    印度尼西亚共产党代表团15日就组织新内阁问题向苏加诺总统表示意见说，如果新成立的内阁是以印度尼西亚国民党和伊斯兰教师联合会为中心，那么，印度尼西亚共产党参加内阁与否都不成问题；如果马斯友美党参加内阁，那么，印度尼西亚共产党将要求成立如苏加诺方案所拟议的合作内阁。
    苏加诺总统向他所邀请来的包括艾地的印度尼西亚共产党代表团说明了目前国家的情势，并且希望印度尼西亚共产党能够协助克服当前的困难。
    关于军事戒严令问题，代表团说，印度尼西亚共产党认为由于国内情势令人耽心，共和国的完整受到威胁，颠复活动在变本加厉，现在宣布全国处于战时紧急状态是必要的，但是，如果国家已经恢复完整，外国颠复活动已经被挫败，那就应该立即恢复正常状态。
