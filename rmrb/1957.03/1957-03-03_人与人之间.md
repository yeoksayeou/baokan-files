More than ten years ago, when I returned to Yan'an from the Taihang Mountains, I visited an old comrade I hadn't seen for a long time. In the middle of our chat, he suddenly asked me with a somewhat aggrieved expression, "Do you think I'm arrogant?"

This comrade was "old" in every respect: old in age, old in revolutionary experience, and in the academic world, an old前辈 (qiánbèi - respected senior) to us. I replied at the time, "Personally, I don't feel you are arrogant."

He stared with his deeply myopic eyes and asked again, "Are you telling me the truth? But why, during the rectification campaign, did many people, especially the young comrades, say that I was arrogant to others?"

I thought for a moment and said, "I'm just honestly saying how I feel, which doesn't represent others. The reason I don't find you arrogant is that I've always approached you as an old 前辈 (qiánbèi), only respecting you and not expecting your respect in return. You see, the Bodhisattva in the temple receives worship, with people kowtowing repeatedly, but he doesn't move or pay any attention; yet, who has ever said the Bodhisattva is arrogant? No one. That's because people go to the temple only to pay their respects to the Bodhisattva, without expecting any reciprocation. I don't expect your reciprocation, but others may not be like that. I treat you this way, but I don't necessarily treat others the same way. The reason others feel you're arrogant is probably that they need some reciprocation from you, and you haven't satisfied that need? But, according to the principle of reciprocity, this request for reciprocation is also human nature, so you should pay attention to it in the future."

This old comrade was frank, earnest, and enthusiastic in his dealings with people. He wouldn't be polite just for the sake of it. When people went to talk to him about certain issues, especially those in books, he would always explain to the best of his knowledge. He knew so much that the discussion often went on for a long time, making it difficult for the other person to get a word in. But sometimes, he wouldn't say a word, because he didn't lie, and since he was still somewhat worldly-wise, he didn't want to tell the truth about certain things or certain people. There were shortcomings in his way of thinking; also, because of his age, the inhibitory function of his cerebral cortex had begun to decline, so he inevitably became a bit long-winded. People who knew his temperament would understand him. But those who didn't understand, especially those who hoped he would reciprocate more, felt he was arrogant or cold.

After I told him this, he laughed.

I also saw that in his work, as long as others sincerely offered him opinions that were pertinent, he could adopt them, although he didn't outwardly appear humble and receptive.

We often see people who appear very humble and receptive. Some of them often smile and ask others for opinions, and they "accept" all opinions, but after "accepting" them, they put them on the shelf; however, they are also very democratic to those who offer opinions, never retaliating. There is also another kind of person—a story in Lesage's novel "Gil Blas" has become a classic: the young Gil Blas was hired by an archbishop as a secretary; the archbishop was famous for his insightful sermons but felt he was getting old and feared his talent was waning, so he repeatedly urged Gil Blas to pay attention to the drafts at all times and honestly point out any shortcomings he found; he also said that if he did so, he would be promoted and rewarded; however, after Gil Blas only once made some comments on the wording, he was dismissed.

There are too many aspects of life, and the relationships between people are very complex. People's hearts are different, and everyone has different needs, so there are different views. From the perspective of personal relationships alone, the same person, when commented on by different individuals, is perceived very differently. As Marx said, "The same object is reflected differently in different individuals and turns its different aspects into equally many different spiritual properties." For example, some people are not sensitive to others' arrogance because they are humble themselves; but there are also those who are humble but easily see others' arrogance; and there are those who are humble and can correctly see others' arrogance and humility. Also, some people are arrogant themselves and do not consider certain more arrogant people to be arrogant, but feel that certain less arrogant people are very arrogant. There are also those who despise others when they are humble, but respect them when they are arrogant. There are also those who only care about words and attitudes and not about actions, or those who don't care about the tone but focus on actions. In this way, it seems very difficult to be a person and to judge people.

But it's not too difficult. There is a way out, which is to look at people and ourselves primarily "from the perspective of a politician, that is, from the perspective of hundreds of millions of people and their interrelationships," to examine and evaluate our own and others' strengths and weaknesses based on the impact on hundreds of millions of people and their interrelationships, on the effectiveness of work, and on the attitude towards the broad masses, instead of just going around in circles based on the fragmentary impressions of this person or that person, then it will be simpler and closer to the truth.

As for personal relationships, I think it's best to first understand the other person's characteristics and then achieve "forgetfulness" regarding certain shortcomings of the other person that are reflected in ourselves—this doesn't mean not to see them clearly or not to offer appropriate reminders, but it means not to dwell on them. For example, for an old man whose inhibitory function has declined, knowing that he will inevitably be long-winded, let him be long-winded, and just spend a little more time to clarify the issue. In fact, all old friends of many years can achieve forgetfulness of many minor aspects of personal relationships.

But it is naturally not easy to do this universally to everyone; this first requires a person to be loyal to the cause of hundreds of millions of people and to "forget oneself," not to think about personal gains and losses, honor and disgrace at all times. We often see many politically cultivated comrades who have achieved this. I myself have seen a lot and also understand that this is the correct way, but I often can't do it, but this is what must be learned.

    人与人之间
    弗先
    十多年前，我从太行山回到延安的时候，会到一位久别了的老同志。闲谈中间，他忽然一脸委屈地问我：“你看我这人骄傲不骄傲？”
    这位同志，各方面都是“老”的：年岁老，革命资格老，而且在学术界，对我们来说，也是一位老前辈。我当时答复他说：“在我，是没有觉得你骄傲的”。
    他瞪着那对深度的近视眼，又问我：“你是老实话么？但是，为什么，在整风的时候，人们、尤其是青年同志们，很多说我对人骄傲呢？”
    我想了一想，说：“我只是老实地说我的感觉，不代表别人。我之所以不觉得你骄傲，是因为我一向把你看作老前辈，来接近，只是尊敬你，却不想得到你的尊敬的缘故。你说，庙里的菩萨，受人膜拜，三跪九叩，他却动也不动，绝不理睬；然而，有谁说过菩萨骄傲的么？没有。那就是因为，人们进庙去，只是去敬礼菩萨，却毫不要求菩萨的回敬的。我不要求你的回敬，但别人未必如此。我对你如此，但对别人则不尽如此。别人之所以觉得你骄傲，大概是他们需要你的一点回敬，而你没有给予满足罢？但礼尚往来，这要求回敬，也是人情之常，所以你今后还是要注意一点。”
    这老同志，待人坦率、认真、热情。他不会客套，有人去跟他谈某些问题，特别是书本上的问题，他总是尽其所知地谈出来；他知道的又多，一谈往往老半天，使得对方难得讲一句话的空子。但有时候，他又一言不发，因为他是不说假话的，而由于究竟有些老世故，所以关于某些事，关于某些人，他也不愿讲真话。这里面，思想方法上的缺点是有的；还因为年纪大了，大脑皮质的抑制作用已见衰退，就不免有些噜囌。知道他的脾气的人，是会谅解他的。但不了解的人，尤其是希望他多回敬一点的人，就觉得他骄傲或冷淡。
    我把这意思也说给他听了之后，他笑起来了。
    我还看到，这老同志，在工作上，只要别人认真地对他提意见，提得中肯，他是能采纳的；虽然态度之间，并没有露出虚怀若谷的样子。
    我们也常常看见态度十分虚怀若谷的人。其中有一些，经常笑嘻嘻地请别人提意见，而且对意见，无不“接受”，但“接受”之后都置之高阁了；不过对提意见者也民主得很，决不打击报复。也有另一种人——在法国勒萨日的小说“吉尔·布拉斯”里面的一个故事，是作为典故而流传的：青年吉尔·布拉斯被一位大主教雇作秘书；那大主教，是以讲道的精辟著名的，但感到自己老了，唯恐“才尽”，所以再三叮嘱吉尔·布拉斯，要他随时注意讲义，一发现缺点，就老实提出警告；还说他如这样做，会得到提拔和奖赏；但是，只一回，吉尔·布拉斯提了一些关于字面的意见，结果就被辞退了。
    生活的方面太多，人与人间的关系很复杂。人心不同、各有所需，所以也有所见，仅仅从个人关系上，同一个人，由不同的个人评论起来，是极不一致的。正如马克思所说：“同一个对象在不同的个人身上会获得不同的反映。并使自己的各个不同方面变成同样多不同的精神性质”。例如，有的因为自己谦虚，所以对别人的骄傲就不敏感；但也有自己谦虚而容易看出别人的骄傲的；又有自己谦虚而能正确地看清别人的骄傲和谦虚的。又如，有自己骄傲，而对某些更骄傲者并不认为骄傲，却对某些不很骄傲者感到很骄傲的。也有看到别人谦虚却轻视之，而感到别人骄傲又尊重他的。也有，只计较言语态度而不计较行为的，或者不问辞色而专重行为的。这样，做人和论人，似乎很难了。
    但也不太难。有一条出路，就是对人，对己，如果主要地“从政治家的眼光看问题，即从千百万人及其相互关系看问题”，从对千百万人及其相互关系的影响上，从工作的效果上，从对广大群众的态度上，去检查和鉴定自己和别人的优点和缺点，而不只在这个和那个人的零零碎碎的印象上团团转，那么，就会简单一些，也会更接近正确些。
    至于在个人关系上，我以为最好是能够先摸熟对方的特点，然后做到对于反射在自己身上的对方的某些缺点的“相忘”——这不是说不要看清，不要适当的提醒，而是说不计较。例如，对于一个抑制作用衰退了的老头儿，明知他免不了噜囌，就让他噜囌吧，多花一点时间，把问题谈清楚算了。实际上，凡是多年的老友，都能做到个人方面许多小节的相忘的。
    但要普遍地对人这样做，自然也不容易；这首先要求一个人忠于千百万人的事业而“忘我”，不随时想到个人的得失荣辱。我们经常看到很多政治上有修养的同志是做到了这一点的。我自己，看得很多，也懂得这样才正确，但往往还做不到，然而这是必须学习的。
