Undeniably, since liberation, the ideological consciousness of the broad masses has undergone a dramatic transformation, but it still lags far behind the political and economic realities. Many people's impressions of the dark old society have faded, or even been forgotten. Some have never or rarely experienced it, so they don't feel or rarely feel the superiority of the new society, or they have excessively high demands on the new society. Especially after the Hungarian and Polish events, people's thoughts have become even more blurred. Theoretically, this is not surprising. But this backward phenomenon, which belongs to the ideological sphere, is bound to have a counter-effect on objective reality. Therefore, we cannot turn a blind eye. Strengthening ideological education among the broad masses, especially cadres, should become one of our current important political tasks.

Based on this, I think we should suggest that the government consider the following two measures:

I. Strengthen Ideological Education Comparing the Old and New Societies

I believe that the most effective way to do this is through vivid propaganda and education methods (such as movies, dramas, novels, comic strips, exhibitions, etc.), and it should penetrate into every corner of society (cities, villages, factories, mines, etc.). It is worth special mentioning that more film projection teams should be organized (speaking of which, it should also be mentioned in passing that general science and education films should also organize more projection teams to go deep into various places, and the content should also be more diversified). Experience has proven that vivid methods are effective in educating the masses, whether in urban or rural areas. Its greatest advantage is that it easily makes people have a strong and concrete impression of its content. In terms of content, there are not many works reflecting the darkness of the old society that have appeared since liberation, and as for the more excellent works in this regard, they are even rarer than phoenix feathers. Some people think that at present, we should mainly educate the masses by depicting new societies and new things, which is correct. But this is only one side of the problem. The other side of the problem is to constantly expose the exploitation of the rulers and the suffering of the people in the old society. Only in this way can we form a comprehensive picture in the minds of the masses, so that they can understand or remember what a long and dark road the Chinese people have gone through. So that they can distinguish between love and hate between the old and the new, and treat life with a realistic attitude, so as to avoid making unrealistic and excessively high demands on the new society, and thus more deeply understand the distinction between the enemy-us contradictions and the people's internal contradictions, and treat these contradictions with a correct attitude.

Secondly, more visits should be organized. This is also a vivid form of education. It can enable people to more intimately recognize the achievements of the motherland's great socialist construction, and deeply appreciate the fundamental changes that have taken place in the face of this backward motherland in these short seven years. Premier Zhou's intention in his report on the transformation of intellectuals, which was to transform thinking through observation and practice of social life, also lies in this. The greatest effect of this kind of activity is that it enables people to cultivate a belief and love for the new society from the depths of their hearts. This love for the new society and hatred for the old society are two aspects of establishing new thinking, and neither is indispensable. We should arrange more visiting opportunities for more people, which may cost more money. At a time when we are calling for increased production and thrift, we should pay attention to this. However, improving the people's political and ideological level is the foundation of the country's cause. If the people's awareness is improved, many tasks can avoid detours. Therefore, I think it is worth spending some money in this regard, and it is also necessary.

II. Improve the Current Methods of Theoretical Study in Institutions, Factories, Mines, and Enterprises

The current situation of theoretical study is unsatisfactory. Taking theoretical study in institutions as an example, it is generally done by concentrating on studying for an afternoon (four hours) every week. Many people, because they only read theoretical books once every week (after all, there are not many people who can persist in theoretical study in their spare time), often forget what they read earlier when they read later, and after studying for a long time, they still cannot get a systematic concept of the subject. I think it is best to change the method. Calculated by study time, four hours per week is equal to 208 hours per year, which is equivalent to 26 working days, which is equal to one month of working days. If this month can be taken out and cadres can be concentrated on studying in rotation, and the weekly four-hour study system is cancelled, it is estimated that the results will be greater. Doing so not only makes it possible for cadres to delve into it and get a systematic concept of the subject, but also easily arouses cadres' interest in theoretical study, thereby encouraging cadres' amateur advanced studies. As far as I know, the People's Publishing House Editorial Department and Xinhua News Agency have already adopted this method last year and feel that the results are very good. Moreover, because not many cadres are drawn out each time, plus the increase in the actual working time of other cadres (due to the cancellation of the weekly study time), the work has not been affected at all. This method is worth promoting.

As for teaching staff in schools, because their job nature and working hours are different from those of general institutional cadres, it may not be suitable to adopt the above method. However, the current learning situation of teachers is generally not good enough, and I would like to ask the relevant institutions to study and consider it.

III. Develop Democratic Style

The above two measures are mainly aimed at the ideological education of the broad masses and general cadres. The following attempts to contribute four immature opinions on further developing the democratic style:

(1) Vigorously improve Party-masses relations:

Regarding this issue, the Party Central Committee and the government have repeatedly given us instructions. Committee member Zhang Zhizhong and other committee members have also provided many situations (according to my personal experience, it has reached a serious stage), which shows that if the Party-masses relations in certain places and certain departments cannot be further improved, it will greatly affect the development of work there. In my opinion, the reason why this situation exists at present is first of all that some Party members and members of the Communist Youth League have varying degrees of sectarianism and bureaucratic thinking, so we should strengthen the ideological education of Party members and members of the Communist Youth League on the mass viewpoint. For non-Party members who are capable, they should be used boldly and reasonably. Even those who have had historical problems or made mistakes, as long as they sincerely repent, they should be restored to their trust, so that the Party can truly unite all forces that can be united and mobilize all positive factors that can be mobilized to engage in our great socialist construction.

(2) Resolutely reverse the phenomenon of excessive concurrent positions:

This is an old problem, but it has never been fundamentally solved. This problem is particularly serious among comrades who are well-known and have high administrative positions. At present, it seems that such a trend has formed: whenever an organization is established, it is always necessary to bring in well-known people in that industry, even if it is just to hang a name, as if the organization cannot be established without this person. If this situation continues, how can it not produce one of the important factors of bureaucracy? How can it not make certain cadres who were originally enthusiastic and capable move further and further away from the masses in their departments? I think that at present, it must be achieved that each person has a dedicated position, and at most no more than two concurrent positions. Only in this way can a part of the people be freed from the tedious meetings and social interactions, and can the growth of bureaucracy be prevented to a great extent.

(3) Regarding the treatment of technical cadres:

We should fully consider that mastering a business is not an easy task, especially in some departments with highly scientific and technical aspects. I think we should fully respect the opinions of technical cadres and humbly learn from them. This is not only for work, but also to close the relationship between the Party and the masses. Disregarding technology is wrong, and unreasonably suppressing or tampering with the opinions of technical cadres is also wrong.

(4) Regarding the transfer of cadres from upper-level organs to lower levels:

This is a measure taken by the government in the work of streamlining institutions, which is reasonable and necessary. I hope to take into account the following principle: The downward transfer of cadres should preferably be carried out layer by layer in order. In general, cadres from provincial-level organs should be transferred to counties, and cadres from county-level organs should be transferred to townships. Doing so is not only to take care of the work (generally speaking, cadres in counties are more familiar with the situation in rural areas than cadres in provinces), but also to take care of the emotions of the cadres. Otherwise, it will not be good for the work or the ideological emotions of the cadres.

These four opinions are humble and have no profound arguments. Based on knowing everything and saying everything, I have listed them above. I hope the government authorities will keep them for reference. (Attached picture)

### 加强人民思想教育  进一步发展民主作风  董竹君的发言

    加强人民思想教育
    进一步发展民主作风
    董竹君的发言
    无庸讳言，解放以来广大群众的思想意识虽有了飞跃的转变，却远远落后于政治与经济的现实。有许多人对过去黑暗社会的印象已经淡漠了，或甚至于忘记了，也有些人从未接触过或很少接触过，因而感觉不到或很少感觉到新社会的优越性，或对新社会要求过高，尤其是匈牙利、波兰事件发生后人们的思想更加模糊了。从理论上看，这是不足奇怪的。但这种属于意识形态的落后现象势必反作用于客观现实。因此，我们不能熟视无睹。加强广大群众、尤其是干部的思想教育，理应成为我们当前的重要的政治任务之一。
    据此，我认为应该提请政府考虑下列两项措施：
    一、加强新旧社会对比的思想教育
    我认为在这方面最有效的还是通过形象的宣传教育方式（例如电影、戏剧、小说、连环图画、展览会等）来进行，并且要深入社会各个角落（城市、农村、工矿等地），值得特别提出的是要多组织电影放映队（说到这里，还应该顺便提一下，一般的科教电影也应该多组织放映队深入各地，内容也要多样化些）。经验证明，无论在城市或乡村，形象化的方式在教育群众方面是行之有效的。它最大的好处是容易使人们对它所表现的内容产生强烈和具体的印象。就内容方面来讲，解放以来所出现的反映旧社会的黑暗的作品也是所见不多，至于这方面较优秀的作品则更罕如凤毛麟角了。有些人以为在目前主要是应该通过对新社会新事物的刻划来教育群众，这是对的。但这仅仅是问题的一面。问题的另一面，还要不断揭发和暴露旧社会中统治者的压榨和人民生活的疾苦情况。唯有这样，才能在群众心目中构成一幅全面的景象，使得他们了解或记得中国人民是经过一段怎样漫长的黑暗道路过来的。使得他们能在新旧之间分清爱和憎的界限，能以现实的态度来对待生活，以免对新社会提出不切实际的过高的要求，从而更深刻地体会到敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾的区分，并以正确的态度来对待这些矛盾。
    其次，是要多组织参观。这也是一种形象化的教育方式。它能使得人们更亲切地认识到祖国伟大的社会主义建设的成绩，深刻地体会到在这短短的七年中，把几千年来这样落后的祖国的面貌起了怎样的根本性的改变。周总理过去在改造知识分子问题的报告中所提到的通过社会生活的观察和实践来改造思想的用意也正在于此。这种活动的最大的效果是使得人们能够从心的深处培植起对新社会的信念和热爱，这种对新社会的热爱和对旧社会的痛恨，是树立新的思想的两个方面，缺一不可。我们应该为更多人安排更多的参观机会，也许会多花些钱，在今天号召增产节约的时候，应该注意这点。但是，提高人民政治思想水平，乃国家事业之本。人民觉悟提高了，许多工作就能少走弯路，因此，我认为在这方面花些钱是值得的，也是必要的。
      二、改进目前机关、厂矿、企业中的理论学习的办法
    目前理论学习的情况是不能令人满意的。以机关中理论学习而论，一般都是采用每星期集中学习一个下午（四小时）的办法。许多人由于每隔一星期看一次理论书（业余能坚持理论学习的人毕竟不多），结果往往是看了后面忘了前面，学了好久始终对该门学科得不出系统的概念。我想最好能改变一下办法。以学习时间计算，每周四小时就等于每年二百零八小时，合二十六个工作日，也就是等于一个月的工作日。如能把这一个月抽出来，让干部轮流集中学习，取消每周四小时的学习制度，则估计收效会更大。这样做不但使干部有可能钻进去，得到对该门学科的系统概念，并且还容易提起干部对理论学习的兴趣，因而也鼓励了干部们的业余进修。据我所知，人民出版社编辑部和新华社已于去年开始采取了这项办法，感到收效很好。并且由于每次抽出干部不多，加上其他干部实际工作时间的增加（因取消了每周的学习时间），结果工作丝毫没有受到影响。这个办法是值得推广的。
    至于学校里的教学工作者，由于他们的工作性质和工作时间不同于一般机关干部，不一定适合采取上述办法。但是目前教员们学习情况一般说来是不够好的，拟请有关机构加以研究考虑。
    三、发展民主作风
    以上提出的两点措施，主要是针对广大群众及一般干部的思想教育而言，以下试图就进一步开展民主作风贡献四点不成熟的意见：
      （一）大力改善党群关系：
    关于这个问题，党中央和政府一再对我们有所指示。张治中委员以及其他各位委员也提供了许多情况（据我个人的体会已到严重的阶段），这说明了某些地方和某些部门中党群关系如果不能进一步求得改善，将会大大影响那里工作的开展。依我看来，目前这种情况之所以存在，首先是部分党团员有着不同程度的宗派主义思想、官僚主义思想，故应加强对党团员的群众观点思想教育。对有能力的党外人士，应大胆而合理地使用，即使是那些历史上有问题或曾犯过错误的人，只要他诚心改过，就应该恢复对他的信任，使党能真正做到团结一切可以团结的力量，动员一切能够动员的积极因素来从事我们伟大的社会主义建设。
      （二）切实扭转兼职过多的现象：
    这是一个老问题，但始终没有获得根本的解决。在较知名和行政职位较高的同志身上，这个问题尤其严重。目前好像已形成这样的风气：任何一个机构的成立，总要把那一行的较知名的人士拉进来，即使是挂一个名也好，好像缺了这个人，该机构就成立不起来似的，这种情况继续下去，怎能不产生官僚主义的重要因素之一呢？怎能不使某些原来有热情有能力的干部不和他部门中的群众相距愈来愈远呢？我认为目前必须做到专人专职，最多不得兼两个以上的职位。唯有这样，才能把一部分人从繁琐的开会、应酬中解脱出来，才能在很大的程度上防止官僚主义的滋长。
      （三）关于对待技术干部的问题：
    应该充分考虑到掌握业务并不是一件很容易的事，尤其在某些具有高度科学技术性的部门中更为如此。我认为，应该充分尊重技术干部的意见，并虚心向他们学习。这不仅单纯为了工作，同时也是为了密切党群关系。轻视技术是不对的，无理压制或篡改技术干部的意见也是不对的。
      （四）关于抽调上层机关干部到下层去的问题：
    这是政府在精简机构工作中的一项措施，是合理的，也是必要的。我希望照顾到这样一条原则：干部的下调最好能逐层按序地进行。在一般情况下，应该是省级机关干部调县，县级机关干部调乡。这样做，不但是为了照顾工作（一般说来，县里干部对乡村情况总比省里干部熟悉些）而且也是为了照顾干部的情绪。否则，对工作，对干部思想情绪都不会有好处。
    这四点意见，卑之无甚高论。本于知无不言，言无不尽，缕述于上。希望政府当局留作参考。（附图片）
