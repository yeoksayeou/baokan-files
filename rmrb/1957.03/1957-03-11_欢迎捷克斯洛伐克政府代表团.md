    Welcoming the Czechoslovak Government Delegation
    Guo Rong, Director of the Sino-Czechoslovak Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhangguozhuang, Beijing
    The news that the Czechoslovak Government Delegation, led by Premier Široký, is visiting China has made all the men, women, and children in our cooperative feel very happy. For several years, our cooperative has had close relations with the fraternal country of Czechoslovakia and has consistently received care and assistance from the Czechoslovak government and people. Therefore, we have a special reason to warmly welcome the distinguished guests from Czechoslovakia.
    Our cooperative began to establish friendly relations with the village of Vinarice in Czechoslovakia on April 24, 1953. On April 24, 1956, we were officially named the "Sino-Czechoslovak Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative." Now we have developed into a large cooperative with 2,146 member households, with more than 24,000 mu of cultivated land, 1,084 head of livestock, 120 carts, and 1,014 pieces of various farm implements.
    Over the years, various delegations and government leaders from Czechoslovakia who have visited China, including Vice-Premiers Kopeczky and Jankovcová, have visited our cooperative. They brought the friendship of the Czechoslovak people and encouraged our cooperative members to work hard to build our motherland. Our Czechoslovak friends have also given our cooperative many production tools and daily necessities, including tractors, water pumps, automobiles, medical equipment, power generators, film projectors, 100 sets of children's clothing, glassware, and picture books. These production tools have helped us to carry out production on large areas of land, saving labor and improving labor productivity. Although we suffered serious damage from floods and hail last year, the efforts of all cooperative members still enabled the yields of some crops to exceed the level of the bumper year of 1955. In 1956, the average income per household in our cooperative was 416.5 yuan, an increase of 14% compared to the 364 yuan income in 1955. This achievement is inseparable from the support and help of our Czechoslovak friends.
    In order to ensure that the diseases of cooperative members can be treated in a timely manner and to reduce the burden on cooperative members, we have established a clinic using the medical equipment sent by Czechoslovakia. In the past, our cooperative members had to go to Changxindian, which is more than a dozen li away from the cooperative, to see a doctor, which not only affected the production of cooperative members, but also caused great inconvenience to them. Since we established the clinic, cooperative members no longer have to travel far to see a doctor as before, and they don't have to pay cash at the time, but can settle the bill at the end of the year.
    Using other gifts from our Czechoslovak friends, we have established a Sino-Czechoslovak Friendship Room, a club, and a nursery. Because of the power generation equipment sent by Czechoslovakia, our cooperative has also installed electric lights. These things not only provide us with great convenience, but also serve as a great encouragement to all cooperative members. This material support embodies the internationalist friendship of the Czechoslovak people and the brotherly friendship between the people of China and Czechoslovakia.
    In recent years, taking advantage of the visits of our delegations to Czechoslovakia, we have also expressed our respect and greetings to our friends in the Vinarice Agricultural Production Cooperative and presented a small gift. The friendship between our two cooperatives and between the people of our two countries has become closer and more consolidated year by year. All the members of our cooperative are closely watching the achievements of the Czechoslovak people in building socialism, and these achievements are also encouraging the people of our country to move forward.
    Now all the staff of our cooperative are working hard to prepare for spring plowing. When they heard that Premier Široký and other distinguished guests were going to visit our country, the cooperative members expressed their determination to actively produce, do a good job in accumulating fertilizer, strive to complete and overfulfill the cooperative's 1957 production plan, and strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year. We feel that this is the best gift for Premier Široký and other distinguished guests.
    Finally, I wish Premier Široký good health!
    Long live the friendship between the people of China and Czechoslovakia! (Attached picture)

    欢迎捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团
    北京张郭庄中捷友好农业生产合作社主任　郭荣
    西罗基总理率领下的捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团到中国来访问的消息，使咱们全社的男女老少都感到非常高兴。咱们这个社好几年来就同兄弟国家捷克斯洛伐克有着密切的关系，并且一直得到捷克斯洛伐克政府和人民的关怀和帮助。所以咱们有特别的理由来热烈欢迎捷克斯洛伐克的贵宾。
    咱们社是在1953年4月24日开始同捷克斯洛伐克的维纳尔日采村建立友好关系的。1956年4月24日，咱们正式命名为“中捷友好农业生产合作社”。现在咱们已发展成为二千一百四十六户社员的大社，社里有耕地二万四千多亩，牲畜一千零八十四头，大车一百二十辆，各式农具一千零一十四件。
    几年来，捷克斯洛伐克到中国来访问的各种代表团和政府领导人，包括副总理柯别茨基和扬科夫卓娃等，都曾到咱们社来参观过，他们带来了捷克斯洛伐克人民的友谊，还勉励咱们社员努力生产建设祖国。捷克斯洛伐克朋友们还送给咱们社许多生产用具和生活用品，包括拖拉机，抽水机，汽车，医疗器械，发电设备，电影放映机，一百套儿童服装，玻璃器皿和图书画片等。这些生产工具帮助咱们在大面积土地上进行生产，节省了劳动力，提高了劳动生产率。尽管咱们在去年受到了涝灾、雹灾的严重危害，但在全体社员的努力下，仍使部分作物的产量超过了丰收的1955年的水平。1956年咱们社里平均每户收入是四百一十六元半，比1955年三百六十四元的收入增加了14％。这种成绩是跟捷克斯洛伐克朋友们对咱们的支持帮助分不开的。
    为了能使社员们的疾病得到及时的治疗，并且给社员减轻负担，咱们利用了捷克斯洛伐克送来的医疗设备成立了一个诊疗所。过去咱们的社员看病要跑到离社十几里地外的长辛店去，这不但影响社员的生产，同时也给社员很大的不便。自从咱们建立了诊疗所以后，社员看病再也不用像以前那样跑很远的道路了，同时也不用当时就给现钱，而可以到年终时再结账。
    利用捷克斯洛伐克朋友赠送的其他礼物，咱们建立了一个中捷友谊室和一个俱乐部，一个托儿站。因为有了捷克斯洛伐克送来的发电设备，咱们社里还按上了电灯。这些东西不但给了咱们很大的便利，而且对于全体社员来说，也是一个莫大的鼓励。这种物质上的支持，体现了捷克斯洛伐克人民的国际主义情谊和中捷两国人民的兄弟般的友好精神。
    这几年来，乘我国代表团访问捷克斯洛伐克的便利，咱们也向维纳尔日采农业生产合作社的朋友们表达了敬意和问候，并且赠送了一点微薄的礼物。咱们两个社之间和咱们两国人民之间的友谊是一年比一年密切巩固了。咱们社的全体社员都在关切地注视着捷克斯洛伐克人民建设社会主义的成就，这些成就也鼓舞着我国人民前进。
    现在咱们社的全体人员都在紧张地搞春耕生产的备耕工作。在听说西罗基总理等贵宾要访问我国时，社员们都表示要积极生产，做好积肥工作，争取完成和超额完成社里的1957年生产计划，争取今年农业生产的大丰收。咱们觉得这是给西罗基总理和别的贵宾们的最好献礼。
    最后，祝西罗基总理身体健康！
    祝中捷两国人民友谊万岁！（附图片）
