　　Harbin Higher Education Institutions
　　Strengthen Political and Ideological Work with Achieved Results
　　Students' Study and Life are Active, and Respect for Teachers and Love for the School are Increasing
    (This report) Since the beginning of this semester, higher education institutions in Harbin have universally strengthened political and ideological education for students. Harbin Foreign Language Institute, Normal College, University of Technology, Northeast Forestry College and other schools, have successively summarized and inspected the political and ideological work of the second half of last year through Party classes, Youth League classes, or by organizing report meetings, student cadre meetings, and study sessions. This helped the broad masses of student cadres to further clarify the methods and ways to strengthen political and ideological work. During this period, various schools also widely organized various report meetings to educate students on inheriting and carrying forward revolutionary traditions. Northeast Forestry College restored past Party classes, convened a representative meeting of the Communist Youth League, and organized discussions on issues such as democracy and centralism, freedom and discipline among League members and young people. In response to students' ideological problems, they organized a report on "Correctly Understanding the Major Studied." The University of Technology convened the Fifth Student Representative Assembly, summarizing the work of the Student Union over the past year, affirming students' progress, and studying the existing ideological problems and the future tasks of the Student Union. Before the meeting, the students also listened to Principal Li Chang's report "On Ideological Work among Students" and Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee Secretary Qiang Xiaochu's report "On the Historical Experience of Further Discussing the Dictatorship of the Proletariat." In addition to convening a League member's meeting, the president of Normal College, Yu Tianfang, also gave a report on the Anti-Japanese Allied Army's struggle. Northeast Agricultural College and Medical College also invited political workers from the People's Liberation Army stationed in Harbin to give reports. In addition, various schools also widely organized various small-scale seminars, visits, and viewing of revolutionary traditional films and other activities.

    After the schools strengthened political and ideological education, the students' socialist consciousness has been further enhanced. At the close of the Student Representative Assembly of the University of Technology, all students wrote a letter to Chairman Mao stating that they must learn from the spirit of hard struggle of the revolutionary predecessors and make themselves faithful successors to the revolutionary cause. After listening to the report "On the Historical Experience of Further Discussing the Dictatorship of the Proletariat," the students of the Electrical Engineering Department of the school actively linked it to their own ideological understanding and participated in discussions. Many League members and young people at the Normal College expressed their determination to correct their shortcomings, get closer to the organization, and request to join the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League after studying and discussing. Some students at the Foreign Language Institute also took the initiative to propose reducing or waiving the student grants they had received to save expenses for the state.

    The students' dedication to study, observance of rules, physical exercise, and solidarity and mutual assistance have also greatly improved in various schools. In the past, many students in this year's graduating class of the Foreign Language Institute, which had more major-related problems, expressed their willingness to obey the state's assignment and go to the posts most needed by the country. Most schools have resumed class exercises and exercise groups. Students from Northeast Forestry College, Normal College, Foreign Language Institute, Agricultural College, and University of Technology and other schools voluntarily carried out voluntary labor such as sweeping snow, cleaning sports grounds, and planing ice rinks. During the "March 8th" Festival, many female students in various schools launched an initiative to "do something meaningful for the school." Some cleaned books, covered books, and mounted book pages for the school library; some did laundry for the food service workers and had fun with male students, etc. At present, the students' love for the collective and the atmosphere of respect for teachers and love for the school are becoming increasingly strong.

　　哈尔滨市各高等学校
　　加强政治思想工作已获成绩
　　学生学习生活活跃，尊师爱校风气日浓
    本报讯　本学期开学以来，哈尔滨市各高等学校普遍加强了对学生的政治思想教育工作。哈尔滨外国语学院、师范学院、工业大学、东北林学院等学校，都相继通过党课、团课或组织报告会、学生干部会、学习会等，总结检查了去年下半年的政治思想工作。帮助广大学生干部进一步明确了加强政治思想工作的方法和途径。在此期间，各校还广泛地组织了各种报告会，向学生进行了继承和发扬革命传统的教育。东北林学院恢复了过去的党课，召开了青年团员代表会议，在团员和青年中，组织了关于民主与集中、自由与纪律等问题的讨论，并针对学生们的思想问题，组织了“正确认识所学专业”的报告。工业大学召开了第五届学生代表大会，总结一年来学生会的工作，肯定同学的进步，研究了当前存在的思想问题和今后学生会的任务。会前该校同学还听取了李昌校长“关于学生当中的思想工作”的报告和黑龙江省委书记强晓初同志“关于再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”的报告。师范学院除召开了团员大会外，该院院长于天放还作了关于抗联斗争的报告。东北农学院和医学院也邀请了解放军驻哈部队政治工作人员做了报告。此外，各校还广泛地组织了各种小型的座谈会以及参观、访问，看革命传统影片等活动。
    各校在加强政治思想教育工作后，学生的社会主义觉悟已有进一步提高。工业大学在学代会闭幕时，全体学生给毛主席写信表示：一定要学习革命前辈的艰苦奋斗的精神，使自己成为革命事业的忠实继承人。该校电机系同学们听了“关于再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”的报告后，积极联系自己思想认识参加讨论。师范学院很多团员和青年经过学习和讨论都表示决心改正缺点，靠近组织，并要求加入共产党和青年团。外国语学院有的学生还主动提出：要求减免已领的助学金，给国家节省开支。
    各校学生的钻研学习、遵守制度、体育锻炼、团结互助等情况也大有好转。过去，专业问题较多的外国语学院的本届毕业班不少同学都表示愿意服从国家分配，到国家最需要的岗位上去。绝大多数学校都已恢复了课间操和锻炼小组。东北林学院、师范学院、外国语学院、农学院、工业大学等校同学都自动进行了扫雪、清理运动场、刨冰场等义务劳动。“三八”节时，许多学校女同学都发起了
  “为学校作一件有意义的事”的倡议。有的为学校图书馆清理图书、包书皮、裱书页；有的为伙食员洗衣服、和男同学联欢等等。目前，各校学生的热爱集体和尊师爱校的风气正日益浓厚。
