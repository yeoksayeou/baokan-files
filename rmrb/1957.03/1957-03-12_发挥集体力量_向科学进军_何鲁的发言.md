Bring into Play the Collective Strength and March Towards Science
He Lu's Speech

    I enthusiastically support Premier Zhou's political report, Vice Premier Li's explanation of the Second Five-Year Plan, and Vice Chairman Chen's work report.

    In the short span of seven years since liberation, our country has achieved unprecedented success in military affairs, politics, diplomacy, national economic construction, and cultural and educational undertakings, which has raised our international standing to an unprecedented level, improved the lives of all people, and increased the world's peace forces immeasurably. These are things that deserve our joy and encouragement. However, our country is an industrially backward country, and science is also very backward. We will encounter many difficulties in our progress, which must be overcome with effort. I am now responding to Chairman Mao's call to march towards science and catch up with advanced countries in science within twelve years. I am offering some immature opinions for your correction.

    Marching towards science is divided into three aspects:

    First, bring into play and carry forward our inherent potential strength, and make these achievements stand at the forefront, for the reference and research of mankind in the world. For example, our history, and the rich astronomical records in history; Chinese calligraphy and painting, and the tools used for calligraphy and painting; Chinese medicine, and treatment methods such as acupuncture and types of drugs; as well as others such as architecture, poetry, music, ceramics, etc. This is a very urgent matter. For example, the astronomical part of Chinese history, or the ancient music part, there are not many people who understand it now, and they are already old. If we let them pass on these academics, it can provide future generations with research and make great contributions to mankind. If it is cut off, it will take more effort to learn and understand in the future.

    Second, cultivate new forces. In addition to formal learning, teachers must teach students the methods of learning, the tools to use (such as foreign languages), and the books that must be read and the works that must be referred to, without reservation. Teachers should choose students with research hopes to interact with more. Students who are willing to research should also automatically approach teachers. Teachers have a responsibility to teach students well, and should also have confidence and feelings. Students should respect, be close to, pay more attention to the advantages of teachers, and forgive shortcomings or give well-intentioned criticism. Junior high school students, high school students, university students, and young workers with some education are all objects of cultivation. If necessary, we can pay attention to gifted education. Elementary school students can skip grades, middle school students can also skip grades, and university students and graduate students can also complete their studies early within the prescribed time limit. These people will become the vanguard of the march towards science. Both teachers and students should have self-cultivation. When teachers get old and retire, they should still be energetic, and can serve as consultants for young teachers and also take apprentices. In their spare time, students should read more stories of modern heroic figures, cultivate noble qualities, and regard the march towards science as a combat mission, so they will naturally be able to overcome difficulties and successfully complete the task. I remember when I was seven or eight years old, a private school teacher taught me a story "Zong Que Riding the Wind". When I was fifteen years old, I took a sea boat from Shanghai to Tianjin and then to Beijing to take the Qinghua School exam. I encountered big waves at sea and thought that Zong Que only wished to ride the long wind and break through thousands of miles of waves, but I am riding the long wind and breaking through thousands of miles of waves, which is truly a grand tour. I was happy in my heart, so I didn't vomit. Later, when I returned to China from Europe, I encountered a big storm in the Indian Ocean for seven days and seven nights. Only me and a Chinese classmate did not vomit, and we could still drink alcohol. This can be regarded as the unconscious connection between education and action. I remember thirty years ago, I met a Go master who said that if I studied mathematics, I would definitely play Go. I said I only knew a little, but he insisted that I play a game with him. I had to agree, and it was over in less than an hour. I naturally lost terribly. He slowly collected the chess pieces and said to me, "You can ask me to replay this game at any time." I said, "I play pieces randomly, how can you remember?" He said, "Although you play pieces randomly, I am dealing with them with my heart, so I remember. But it can only last for three days. If you want me to replay it a year later, you must recite it once every three days until a year passes and you won't forget it!" I think this method is very good for learning and can keep your memory from declining in old age.

    Third, bring into play the collective, planned, and organized strength. The research work in capitalist countries is done separately and is also divorced from reality. Sometimes they get stuck in a rut, and sometimes they have unexpected gains. For example, a French chemist wanted to turn carbon into diamonds, but there were no results. The Curies found radium when refining uranium. Its radioactivity is much stronger than uranium and became the greatest invention of the late nineteenth century. If we arrange according to the needs of national economic development, and combine the advanced experience of the Soviet Union with the special conditions of our country to raise problems, and then plan and organize, how many people need to lead a certain research work, how many experts, how many assistants, how to train if there are not enough, and how much funding is needed, and then proceed step by step, and bring into play the collective strength, we can get results faster. From now on, we still have more than 20 years of heavy industry construction, and the funds required are extremely huge. Vigorously increasing production and practicing economy is completely timely and correct, but we must strictly avoid the waste of materials and prevent the destruction of materials. I saw in the Southwest that some leading cadres have developed bureaucracy and do not accept criticism, and some people suppress criticism for bureaucrats, which can only bring greater losses to the people. Grassroots cadres are eager to realize socialism, and sometimes they are too rash, which also causes great losses to the people. New social undertakings are bound to make mistakes, which is understandable, but we must learn from mistakes and avoid repeating them. The government should also have appropriate handling, otherwise bureaucracy will continue to grow. If cadres from senior to grassroots are protecting each other, who will dare to speak? Therefore, I increasingly feel the importance of the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. Criticism is not easy, and being able to accept criticism is even greater. On the seventeenth of last month, the People's Daily had a short article, the general idea of which was that speaking should be honest and smart, not honest and stupid. I will exhaust my stupid sincerity. If you can appreciate its sincerity and forgive its stupidity, then I would be fortunate. (Attached picture)

### 发挥集体力量　向科学进军  何鲁的发言

    发挥集体力量　向科学进军
    何鲁的发言
    我热诚地拥护周总理的政治报告，李副总理的关于第二个五年计划的说明，以及陈副主席的工作报告。
    我国在解放后短短的七年时间内，无论在军事上，在政治上，在外交上，以及在国民经济建设的事业上，与在文教事业上，皆取得了史无先例的成绩，使国际地位空前提高；人民生活全体得到改善；世界和平力量无比地增大；这些是值得我们欢欣鼓舞的。但是我国是工业落后的国家，科学也非常落后，在前进中会遇到许多困难，必须努力加以克服的。我今响应毛主席的号召向科学进军，于十二年内赶上科学的先进国家，发表一点不成熟的意见，请大家指正。
    向科学进军分三方面：
    一，发挥固有的潜在力量而加以发扬光大，并使这些成就占在最前列，供世界人类的参考研究。例如我国的历史，与历史上丰富的天文记载；中国的字画，同字画所用的工具；中国的医药，与医治方法如针灸及药物种类；以及其他的如建筑、诗歌、音乐、陶瓷等等，这是一件很迫切的事。如中国历史的天文部分，或古乐部分，现在懂的人已不多了，而且已老了，若是让他们把这些学术传下来，既可供后人研究，对于人类供献也大，若是断了，将来再去学去懂，就要多费气力了。
    二，培养新生的力量。于正规学习外，教师要毫无保留地教学生学的方法，用的工具（如外文）以及必须熟读的同必须参考的著作。教师要选择有研究希望的学生多与来往，学生愿意研究的，也要自动地亲近教师，教师对教好学生有责任，也要有信心有情感，学生对教师要尊敬，要亲近，要多注意好处，原谅短处或给予善意的批评都可以。初高中的学生，大学的学生以及略有文化的青年工人，都是培养的对象，必要时可注意天才教育，小学学生可以跳班，中学学生也可以跳班，大学生及研究生于规定年限内也可提早完成其学业，这些人就成为向科学进军的先锋队。教师与学生都要有修养。教师老了退休了，仍然要神明不衰，既可作青年教师的顾问，也可以带徒弟。学生业余，要多看近代英雄人物的故事，养成高尚品质，对于科学进军当作战斗任务，自然能够克服困难，胜利完成任务。我记得在七八岁时私塾先生教了我一个故事“宗悫乘风”，十五岁时由上海坐海船到天津转北京，去考清华学校，在海上遇着大浪，想到宗悫不过愿乘长风破万里浪，我却正在乘长风破万里浪，真是壮游。心里高兴，就未呕吐。后来从欧洲回国，在印度洋遇着大风浪，七天七夜，客人只有我同一个中国同学未吐，并且还可饮酒，这算是教育不知不觉地与行动的联系。我记得三十年以前，遇见一个围棋高手，说我学数学一定会下围棋。我说只懂一点，他坚决要我同下一盘，我只得答应，不到一小时就下完了，我自然输得一塌糊涂，他慢慢收棋子同我说“这盘棋你要我任何时候重行摆出都可以”我说：“我随便下子，你如何能记？”他说：“你虽随便下子，我在用心应付，所以记得，但只能管三天，你如要我一年后摆出，每隔三天，须念一遍，直到一年就不会忘了！”我觉得这方法用于学问甚好，可使记性到老不衰。
    三，发挥集体有计划有组织的力量，资本主义国家的研究工作是各搞各的，也是脱离实际的，有时钻牛角，有时也有意外的收获。如像法国某化学家想把炭变为金钢钻，总无结果。居里夫妇提炼铀时反找到镭，它的放射性比铀还强得多，成为十九世纪末的最大发明。我们若是按照发展国民经济的需要来安排，又结合苏联的先进经验与本国的特殊情况提出问题，再行计划组织，某项研究工作，需用那些人领导，要专家若干，助手若干，不够时如何培养，及需经费若干，然后有步骤地进行，并发挥集体力量，可以更快地得着成绩。我们从现在起还有二十余年的重工业建设，所需资金极其浩大，厉行增产节约完全是适时的而且是正确的，但必须严厉的避免物资的浪费，杜绝物资的毁坏。我在西南看到某些领导干部滋长了官僚主义又不接受批评，还有些人替官僚主义者压抑批评，这只能为人民带来更大的损失。基层干部急于求社会主义的实现，有时太为冒进，也使人民遭到很大的损失。新的社会事业难免不发生错误，这是可以理解的，但必须从错误中吸取教训，避免再犯，政府也应该有适当的处理，不然官僚主义还要滋长，若从高级到基层的干部都在官官相卫，还有谁人敢说话呢？所以愈来愈觉得批评与自我批评这一武器的重要性。批评已不容易，能接受批评更见伟大。上月十七日人民日报有一篇短文大意是说说话要诚实而聪明，不要诚实而愚笨，我竭我的愚诚，若能鉴其诚谅其愚，那就幸甚幸甚。（附图片）
