　　The Romanian Peasant Uprising of 1907
　　Fifty years ago, on a spring night, raging flames rose in three villages in northern Moldova, and these flames quickly spread throughout Romania. Hundreds of thousands of peasants took up pitchforks and scythes, fighting heroically for bread, land, and freedom. This was the peasant uprising of 1907, the largest uprising in Romanian history.
　　The main reason for the uprising was that the peasants could not endure the heavy oppression and brutal exploitation of the landlords and bourgeoisie. The land reform of 1864 did not solve the peasant problem, and the peasant masses, who shed blood in the war against Turkey in 1877, did not get any benefits from the victory of the war; on the contrary, with the intrusion of capitalism into the countryside, they suffered even greater exploitation. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, peasants constantly rose up to fight the oppressors. Uprisings occurred in 1888, 1892, 1904, and 1906, and in 1907, the movement reached its peak. At that time, the peasants were overwhelmed by the heavy burden of taxes. Compared with 1864, taxes had tripled. The number of landless and land-poor peasants also greatly increased compared to 1864, with one-third of the country's peasants having no land. As early as fifteen years before the uprising, the Romanian peasant poet George Coşbuc foreshadowed the coming storm in his poem entitled "We Need Land."
　　The massive peasant uprising of 1907 gave the landlords and bourgeoisie a heavy blow. The uprising peasants attacked the landlords' manors, burned land contracts, and even measured the land to distribute it... The young Romanian working class gave them great support, and in some places, workers joined the peasants in the struggle.
　　The uprising failed under the bloody suppression of the combined reactionary forces and army of the landlords and bourgeoisie. More than 11,000 peasants were killed, and a large number of people were thrown into prison. However, the blood of the insurgents was not shed in vain. The goals that the peasants fought for with their lives in 1907 were achieved after Romania got rid of the rule of landlords and bourgeoisie in 1944. The peasants have bread, land, rights, and freedom, and socialism has taken root in the countryside of the new Romania.
　　The Romanian people, advancing on the road of a new life, will always remember their predecessors who fought for their ideals. Since February this year, various commemorative activities have been launched throughout Romania to solemnly commemorate the 50th anniversary of the peasant uprising of 1907. (Nai) (With picture)

### 1907年的罗马尼亚农民起义

　　1907年的罗马尼亚农民起义
    五十年前一个春天的夜晚，摩尔多瓦北部三个村庄燃起了熊熊的火焰，这火焰很快就燃遍了整个罗马尼亚。成千上万的农民拿起木叉和镰刀，为争取面包、土地和自由而英勇斗争。这就是1907年的农民起义，它是罗马尼亚历史上最大的一次起义。
    起义的主要原因是农民不堪忍受地主和资产阶级的沉重压迫和残酷剥削。1864年的土地改革没有解决农民问题，而在1877年反土耳其战争中流过血的农民群众，也没有从战争胜利中得到任何好处；相反地，随着资本主义的侵入农村，他们受的剥削更重了。十九世纪末和二十世纪初，农民曾不断起而向压迫者进行搏斗。1888、1892、1904和1906年，都陆续有起义发生，到1907年，这个运动达到了高峰。当时农民被沉重的赋税负担压得喘不过气来。同1864年相比，捐税增加了三倍。无地和少地农民的数目也比1864年大大增加了，全国有三分之一的农民没有土地。早在起义前十五年，罗马尼亚农民诗人乔治·科什布克就在他的题为“我们需要土地”的诗篇中，预告了暴风雨的到来。
    声势浩大的1907年农民起义，给了地主和资产阶级以沉重的打击。起义农民攻打地主的庄园、焚毁土地契约，以至量地分地……。年轻的罗马尼亚工人阶级给了他们以大力的支持，有些地方，工人同农民一起参加了斗争。
    在地主和资产阶级联合的反动势力及其军队的血腥镇压下，起义失败了。一万一千多农民被杀害，还有大批人被投入牢狱。但是，起义者的鲜血不是白流的。农民们1907年用生命争取的目标，在1944年罗马尼亚摆脱地主和资产阶级统治以后获得实现了。农民有了面包、土地、权利和自由，社会主义已在新罗马尼亚的农村里根深蒂固。
    在新生活道路上前进的罗马尼亚人民，永远记得他们为理想而斗争的先辈。今年2月份以来，罗马尼亚全国各地展开了多种纪念活动，隆重纪念1907年农民起义的五十周年。　（乃）（附图片）
