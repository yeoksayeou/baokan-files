　　This meeting has excited me the most because Chairman Mao's instructions at the enlarged meeting of the Supreme State Conference on "Correctly Handling Contradictions Among the People" clearly distinguished between contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and contradictions among the people, which improved my ideological understanding. I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Chen and Li, and I am willing to work hard in my position to implement them. Now I would like to talk about the following two points:

　　(1) On the issue of urban construction: In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, the construction of cities across the country, like other work, has made rapid progress. For example, Lanzhou, one of the industrial cities in the country, had a population of less than 200,000 in 1950, but by December of last year, it had reached 680,000. In the early days of liberation, Lanzhou City was only ten li long from east to west. Now the urban area extends from Donggang Town to Hekou, reaching more than 100 li, with four iron bridges (Yellow River Bridge) and two pontoon bridges, and factories and schools stand in great numbers, with all kinds of new buildings connected together. Such a speed of construction is indeed astonishing! Other industrial cities in the province are also being built at an ever-changing pace. This is the general situation of urban construction. Regarding the urban construction planning issue, I fully agree with the speech of Committee Member Ye Gongchuo on March 14. I would also like to talk about the issue of non-productive construction. Some people have reflected that in some industrial cities, non-productive construction is too much, too fast, and too particular. This is certainly one aspect. I believe that, on the other hand, in some newly built industrial cities, non-productive construction is, on the contrary, too slow and too little. Because the increase in population in these newly built industrial areas is very rapid, such as engineering and technical personnel, workers, service personnel, and their families, etc. When a large factory starts construction, it is necessary to first solve the problems of food, clothing, housing, transportation, children's schooling, and all other recreational activities for these workers. Only in this way can they work smoothly and with peace of mind. Therefore, in newly built and expanded industrial cities, productive construction and non-productive construction must be carried out simultaneously. Not only can non-productive construction not be lacking, but it also cannot be delayed. As for standards and equipment, I fully agree with the instructions of Vice Premier Li Fuchun: "Non-productive buildings should lower standards as much as possible, and civil buildings should not be too different from the level of the local masses." In addition, regarding the matters that should be paid attention to in urban construction, I believe that the correct instructions of Vice Premiers Li and Chen are aimed at the problems of greed for large size, novelty, and luxury in some newly built and expanded cities. In order to implement this spirit, the urban plans that are being built or are about to be built should be rationally revised and corrected from beginning to end in accordance with the instructions of Vice Premiers Li and Chen. All rooms that can be repaired should be repaired, those that can be used should be used as much as possible, and those that can be demolished less or delayed should be demolished less and delayed. The construction and repair of urban roads that need to be opened up slowly should be slowed down, those that need to be reduced can be reduced, and the width of the road should not be too narrow or too wide, but must be appropriate and reasonable. All unnecessary projects that can be postponed should be postponed according to the situation. In terms of engineering materials, those that can be replaced and utilized and made locally should be utilized as much as possible, and materials should be taken locally to avoid long-distance transportation and waste of financial resources. In addition, when planning new and expanded cities, each construction area should, according to local conditions, leave appropriate cultivated land for planting vegetables and fruit trees, so that the urban vegetable problem can be solved and it can also replace the role of greening.

　　(2) On the issue of children's schooling: According to some people's reflections, they believe that primary and junior high school education should be developed on a larger scale, properly arranged, and meet the requirements of the masses as much as possible. Their opinions are:

　　(1) We must establish a solid foundation for socialist industrialization, promote the comprehensive development of the agricultural economy, promote the technical transformation of the national economy, and cultivate enough talents for national construction quickly. Then we must improve the cultural and scientific level of the people. Some people said: "In addition to the state cultivating enough specialized talents according to needs, all the remaining young people, even if they participate in agricultural production, should at least be taught to reach a junior high school education level. This is a condition that a citizen of a socialist country should possess." This statement and view may not be comprehensive enough, but I think the government should consider the arrangement of primary and junior high school education.

　　(2) Now many people participate in work and production during the day and literacy classes in the evening. Some housewives, in extremely hot and cold weather, still hold their children to participate in literacy classes. This shows that with the development of the country's socialist economy, the masses have an urgent need for culture and knowledge. Therefore, what they are most worried about now is that their children have no schools to study in. Of course, they also understand that it is currently impossible for everyone to go to university and become experts. But they think it is necessary to have a certain level of education. Therefore, some people say: "Today I participate in literacy, and the children have nowhere to study. In the future, we will have to teach them literacy." This shows the masses' concern and demand for their children's education.

　　(3) The age of primary school graduates is generally twelve or thirteen years old. Even if they receive half a year of technical education, their physical development is still not healthy enough. If they are taught to participate in inappropriate work and labor, it will affect their health. This should be noted. As for junior high school graduates, if they cannot go to a higher school, it is certainly no problem to give them one or two years of spare-time technical education to enable them to participate in work or labor.

　　Based on the above situation, I fully agree with the opinions provided by Committee Member Liu Wang Liming on March 12 on the issue of the future of primary school graduates and young people. I believe that, on the one hand, in addition to promoting the two-part system and advocating private primary schools and schools run by government organs, on the other hand, the funds of cultural, educational, and related departments should be carefully calculated and unnecessary expenses should be reduced. More money should be squeezed out from all aspects to strengthen the education from elementary to junior high school to meet the needs of the masses in this regard as much as possible. This will not increase national treasury expenditures, solve the children's schooling problem, and also solve the masses' ideological burden in this regard.

　　The above two points are not comprehensive. Please refer to the relevant departments and ask for criticism and correction from everyone. (Attached picture)

### 对城市建设和小孩上学问题的意见　蒋云台的发言

　　对城市建设和小孩上学问题的意见
　　蒋云台的发言
    这次会议使我最兴奋的，是毛主席在最高国务会议扩大会议上指示的“正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题”，对敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部的矛盾，有了明确的区别，使我提高了思想认识。陈、李两副总理的报告我完全同意，愿在自己的工作岗位上努力实现贯彻执行。现在我谈以下两点意见：
      （一）关于城市建设问题：几年来全国各个城市的建设，在党和政府的正确领导下，和其他工作一样，有了突飞猛进的发展。如全国工业城市之一的兰州，在1950年人口不满二十万，到去年12月，已经达到了六十八万人。解放初期的兰州市，东西长不过十华里，现在的市区由东岗镇至河口，长达一百多华里了，有铁桥四座（黄河桥），便桥两座，工厂学校林立，各式各样的新式建筑，联成一片。这样的建设速度，的确是惊人的！省内其他各个工业城市，都是在日新月异地建设着，这是城市建设的一般情况。另外关于城市建设规划问题，我完全同意3月14日叶恭绰委员的发言。我还要谈谈非生产性的建筑问题。有人反映说，某些工业城市中，非生产性的建筑太多、太快、太讲究，这当然是一方面；我认为另一方面，在某些新建的工业城市中，对非生产性的建筑，相反地还嫌太慢太少了。因为这些新建的工业地区，人口的增加是非常快的，如像工程技术人员、工人、服务人员和他们的眷属等等，在一个大工厂开始建设的时候，就得先解决这些工作人员的吃饭穿衣问题、住房交通问题、子女的上学问题和其他一切文娱活动问题。这样他们才能顺利地安心地进行工作。因此在新建和扩建的工业城市中，生产性的建筑和非生产性的建筑，必须同时配合进行，对非生产性的建筑不但不能缺少，并且还不能推迟。至于标准和设备问题，我完全同意李富春副总理的指示：“非生产性的建筑，尽可能降低标准，民用建筑，不能同当地群众的水平过分悬殊”。另外关于城市建设中应注意的事项，我认为李、陈两副总理的正确指示针对着某些新建和扩建城市的贪大、贪新、贪豪华的毛病，为了贯彻这种精神，应当把正在建设或将要开始建设的城市规划，从头到尾，按照李、陈两副总理的指示，加以合理的修改和纠正。对所有的用房，能整修的加以整修，能利用的尽量利用，能少拆或缓拆的，尽量少拆和缓拆。对市区道路的建修，需要缓开辟的应当缓开，需要减少的可以减少，路幅不要过窄过宽，必须适当合理，一切不必要的工程，能够向后推迟的按情况推迟。在工程材料方面，能够代替利用和就地制作的，尽量利用，就地取材，以免远道运输，浪费财力。另外新建和扩建城市规划时每个建筑地区与地区之间，按照当地情况，尽可能地留出适当的耕地，以便种植蔬菜和果树，这样既可解决城市菜蔬问题，又可代替绿化作用。
      （二）关于小孩子的上学问题：据一些群众反映，认为对小学和初中这两部分教育事业，应当较大量的发展，妥善安排，尽可能的满足广大群众的要求。他们的意见是：
      （1）我们要建立社会主义工业化的巩固基础，要促进农业经济的全面发展，并要推进国民经济的技术改造，还要为国家迅速地足够地培养各项建设人才，那就必须要提高人民群众的文化和科学水平。有些群众说：“我们对下一代的青年，除国家按需要培养足够的专门人才外，其余所有的青年，就是参加农业生产去，起码也应该教他们达到一个初中的文化程度，这是社会主义国家的一个公民应该具备的条件。”这种说法和看法，可能不够全面，但是我认为对小学和初中这两部分教育事业的安排，政府应当加以考虑。
      （2）现在有很多群众，白天参加工作和生产，晚间参加扫盲学习，有些家庭妇女在奇热奇冷的天气里，还抱着小孩去参加扫盲学习，这就说明了随着国家社会主义经济的发展，广大人民群众对于文化、知识的迫切要求，因此他们目前最担心的是，他们的孩子们没有学校去读书的问题。当然他们也明白，每个人都要进大学，都要成专家，目前是不可能的。但是具有一定的文化程度他们认为是必需的。因此有些群众这样说：“今天我参加扫盲，孩子们没有地方念书，将来还要扫他们的盲。”这就看出群众对子女读书问题的关切和要求了。
      （3）高小学校毕业生的年龄，一般是十二三岁，就是加受一半年的技术教育，他们身体的发育，还是不够健全的，如果教他们参加不适当的工作和劳动，是会影响健康的，这是应该注意的地方。至于初中毕业生，如果不能升学的话，给他们再施一两年的业余技术教育，使他们参加工作或劳动，那当然是没有问题的。
    根据以上的情况，我完全同意3月12日刘王立明委员关于高小毕业生和青少年出路问题提供的意见。我认为一方面推广二部制和提倡民办小学、机关办学外，另一方面把文教和有关部门的经费，再精打、再细算，压缩不必要的开支，从各方面再挤出一些钱来，加强初小到初中这一段落的教育事业，尽可能的满足群众在这方面的要求。这样做既不增加国库开支，又解决了小孩子的求学问题，同时也解决了群众在这方面的思想负担。
    以上两点意见，很不全面，请有关部门参考，并请各位批评指正。（附图片）
