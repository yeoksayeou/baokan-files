Xinhua News Agency, March 7th: Xu Guangping, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, at the capital's gathering commemorating "March 8th" International Women's Day, called on women across the country to actively respond to the Party and government's call for increased production and thrift, strive to improve their communist consciousness, strengthen unity, overcome difficulties, build the country diligently and thriftily, manage their homes diligently and thriftily, and strive to be active elements in socialist construction.

In her report at the meeting, Xu Guangping announced that in the past year, the number of female workers nationwide had increased to about three million, and more than 110 million women had participated in agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery production cooperatives. There were also more than 1.5 million female members of handicraft cooperatives nationwide. They have all created brilliant achievements in production and become a huge force in socialist construction.

In her report, Xu Guangping recalled the situation of the past year. In addition to the significant increase in the number of female workers and women participating in various production cooperatives, and the significant changes in women's economic status, Xu Guangping pointed out that women's social and political status has also been significantly improved. According to incomplete statistics, in the second round of grassroots elections nationwide, women elected as grassroots people's representatives accounted for 22.5% of the total number of representatives. Women across the country also enthusiastically responded to the call to march towards culture, technology, and science. About 30 million women nationwide participated in literacy campaigns, and many working-class and peasant women improved their technical and scientific knowledge in their labor. Many female educators, scientists, literary and art workers, and medical workers have made great contributions under the guidance of the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy.

Xu Guangping then focused on the question of how women can strive to be active elements in socialist construction. She said: The most important point is to constantly improve their awareness as masters of the country, enhance their sense of responsibility for the cause of socialist construction, and establish the idea of ​​everything for socialism and everything for the construction of the motherland. In this way, we will have ideological weapons and be able to adhere to the socialist road in any situation without losing our direction.

Xu Guangping said: Women in our country have always had the fine traditions of diligence, thrift, and hard work. We must inherit and carry forward this fine tradition, implement the spirit of building the country diligently and thriftily, and managing the home diligently and thriftily, and create extraordinary achievements in ordinary labor. Women in various production and work positions should better love their work, study their business, and constantly improve their work skills and labor productivity. Housewives should continue to implement the "Five Goods." She called on women working in all walks of life to strive to be "female champions." Because if women are to play an active role in socialist construction, they must not only have awareness but also ability.

She said: Our country has created many conditions to help women solve the difficulties in work and production in order to give full play to women's socialist enthusiasm. In the future, in addition to gradually developing women and children's welfare undertakings with the development of production, we must vigorously mobilize social forces to set up childcare organizations to solve women's difficulties in raising children. Women themselves must also make appropriate arrangements for housework and children.

Finally, Xu Guangping expressed her views on contraception and late marriage. She said: For the health of mothers and infants, for better education of children, and for a happier family life, married women should pay attention to planning their children according to their own conditions and desires, and appropriately regulate the density of births. Unmarried young women are best to marry later. The marriage age stipulated by the Marriage Law is a minimum marriage age, not that you must get married when you reach this age. Getting married later is good for your health, your children, your family, and your career.

In concluding her speech, Xu Guangping said: Women in our country will continue to work hard to learn from the advanced experience of women in the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, strengthen the unity of women in socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and enhance understanding and friendship with women in Asia, Africa, and other countries around the world, and work together for peace, women's rights, and the happiness of children.

    争取做社会主义建设积极分子
    许广平在首都纪念“三八”节大会上的讲话
    新华社7日讯　中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席许广平在首都各界妇女纪念“三八”国际妇女节大会上，号召全国妇女积极响应党和政府的增产节约号召，努力提高共产主义觉悟，加强团结，克服困难，勤俭建国，勤俭治家，争取做社会主义建设的积极分子。
    许广平在会上所作的报告中宣布说，去年一年中，全国女职工人数约已增加到三百万人左右，参加农业、林业、牧业、渔业等生产合作社的妇女已达一亿一千多万人。全国手工业合作社女社员也有了一百五十多万人。她们在生产中都创造了辉煌的成就，成为社会主义建设的一支巨大力量。
    许广平在报告中回忆了过去一年的情况。去年除了女职工和参加各种生产合作社的妇女人数有了显著的增加，妇女的经济地位有了显著的变化外，许广平指出，去年妇女的社会政治地位也有显著的提高。据不完全统计，全国第二次基层选举中，妇女当选为基层人民代表的占代表人数的22.5％。全国妇女也热情地响应了向文化、技术、科学进军的号召，全国参加扫盲学习的妇女约有三千多万人，很多工农妇女，在劳动中提高了技术和科学知识。许多女教育工作者、科学工作者、文艺工作者、医务工作者，在“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针指导下作出了巨大贡献。
    许广平接着着重谈到了妇女怎样争取做社会主义建设积极分子的问题。她说：最主要一点是不断提高自己的国家主人翁的自觉，增强自己对社会主义建设事业的责任感，树立一切为社会主义、一切为祖国建设的思想。这样，我们就有了思想武器，就能在任何情况下坚持走社会主义道路，不会迷失方向。
    许广平说：我国妇女一贯具有勤劳俭朴、艰苦奋斗的优良传统。我们要继承发扬这个优良传统，贯彻勤俭建国，勤俭治家的精神，在平凡的劳动中，创造出不平凡的事迹。在各种生产工作岗位上的妇女，要更好地热爱自己的工作，钻研业务，不断提高自己工作的熟练程度和劳动生产效率。家庭妇女要继续贯彻“五好”。她号召在各行各业中工作的妇女要争取当“女状元”。因为妇女要在社会主义建设中发挥积极作用，不但要有觉悟，而且要有本领。
    她说：我们国家为了充分发挥妇女的社会主义积极性，在帮助妇女解决工作、生产的困难方面创造了很多条件。今后除了随着生产的发展逐步发展妇女儿童的福利事业外，要大力动员社会力量举办托儿组织解决妇女扶育子女的困难。妇女自身也必须对家务、孩子作适当的安排。
    许广平最后就避孕和晚婚问题发表了意见。她说：为了妇婴健康，为了更好地教育子女，为了使家庭生活过得更幸福，已婚妇女，要注意根据自己条件，自己的愿望有计划地生育子女，适当地调节生育密度。未婚的青年妇女最好晚一点结婚，婚姻法规定的结婚年龄，是一个最低限度的结婚年龄，并不是到这年龄就要结婚。晚一点结婚，对身体，对子女，对家庭，对事业都是有好处的。
    许广平在结束她的讲话时说：我国妇女一定继续努力学习苏联和各兄弟国家妇女的先进经验，加强以苏联为首的社会主义各国妇女的团结，并与亚非以及世界各国妇女增进了解和友谊，为和平，为妇女权利和儿童幸福而共同奋斗。
