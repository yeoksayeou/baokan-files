Continuing the Compilation of Local Chronicles
Gu Jiegang, Li Peiji, and Ye Gongchuo Jointly Propose Eight Implementation Guidelines

Local chronicles are a unique thing in our country. Starting with the "Yue Jue Shu," it has been nearly two thousand years. Since then, provincial chronicles, prefectural chronicles, county chronicles, and even township chronicles have often existed. Up until the last twenty years, there were still thousands of such books. Their content encompasses mountains, rivers, establishment of settlements, climate, products, people, customs, history, anecdotes, and legends of the respective localities, encompassing everything. Combined, they can form a large book; separated, they each become fragments. Although the compilation varies in quality, their functions are extensive. Therefore, the Ming and Qing dynasties both valued this matter. The famous Gu Yanwu's "Tianxia Junguo Libingshu" (A Record of the Advantages and Disadvantages of the Regions of the Nation) and Gu Zuyu's "Du Shi Fangyu Jiyao" (Essentials of History and Geography) were compiled by combining local chronicles. After the Xinhai Revolution, it continued uninterrupted. When Chiang Kai-shek was in power, it became silent, which is extremely regrettable. I think this traditional and excellent recording method should not be interrupted, because it takes the region as the center, richly preserves various local materials, makes diverse recordings, grasps the ethnic, historical, economic, and cultural facts of that area, not only providing references for national construction and scientific research, but also inspiring the people's spirit of patriotism and love for their hometowns. I remember that someone proposed this at the previous National People's Congress. We think it is still timely to do it now. We hereby extract some key implementation guidelines as follows:

	1.	The compilation of local chronicles is temporarily limited to counties and cities under the jurisdiction of each province and municipalities directly under the Central Government. The provinces should supervise the progress of counties and cities under their jurisdiction. The Central Government should supervise the progress of municipalities directly under it. All should start within 1958 and be included in the administrative plan budget of the province, city, and municipality directly under the Central Government.
	2.	The format of each chronicle, its outline shall be determined by the Central Government. It can also be modified by each locality according to actual conditions, and submitted to the Central Government for approval before proceeding.
	3.	The funds for compiling chronicles should be raised and paid by the provinces and municipalities directly under the Central Government; however, simplification should be the principle. For example, local elders and intellectuals can be recruited for division of labor. Only a small amount of subsidies are required for interviews, copying, and proofreading. Printing costs can be covered by sales revenue.
	4.	Local statistical charts and archives (such as land, small and medium-sized water conservancy, population, industry, agriculture, handicrafts, commerce, taxation, transportation, education, health, etc.) should be selectively copied and sent to the Chronicle Compilation Office. The Chronicle Compilation Office can also retrieve various statistical charts and archives for reference.
	5.	Local administrative and cultural and educational institutions and their teaching staff have the obligation to assist in interviewing and collecting materials. Those who work effectively will be rewarded.
	6.	The Central Government should establish a Chronicle Compilation Guidance Committee under the State Council, specializing in the compilation of chronicles in various regions. Each region should establish a Chronicle Compilation Office as a permanent organ.
	7.	For matters that are difficult for various localities to handle on their own, such as geology, topography, biology, large-scale water conservancy, large-scale weather observation, comparative languages, etc., the Central Chronicle Compilation Guidance Committee can find materials on its behalf, or consult relevant agencies to assist in interviewing and soliciting.
	8.	Various chronicles-related books, archives, manuscripts, collated copies, and lost editions, whether published or unpublished, in various regions should be interviewed and preserved by each Chronicle Compilation Office. If there are major discoveries and necessary treatments that cannot be handled by the strength of one place, it may report to the Central Chronicle Compilation Guidance Committee for handling.

The above eight points are just a brief outline, and more detailed regulations are still needed for implementation. Whether it is appropriate or not, please review and approve.

    继续编纂地方志
    顾颉刚、李培基、叶恭绰联合提出八条实行纲要
    我国的各地方志是一种特有的东西，自“越绝书”创始，将二千年，自后省志、府志、县志以至乡镇往往都有志书；至近二十年为止，所存的尚有数千种。其内容则各该地的山川、建置、气候、物产、人物、风俗、历史、遗闻逸事，无所不包，合之可成一部大书，分之亦各成片段，虽编纂互有优劣，而功用实甚广大，故明清两代均重视此事。著名的顾炎武“天下郡国利病书”和顾祖禹“读史方舆纪要”即系汇合方志而成。辛亥以后，尚联绵未断。蒋氏居位，始寂然无闻，这是极可惜的事。我想这种传统的优良纪载办法，是不该令其中断的，因为它以地区为中心，丰富的保存了乡土各种资料，做多种多样的纪载，掌握了那一区的民族、历史、经济、文化各事实，不但提供国家建设和科学研究的参考，而且足以激发人民爱国爱乡的精神。记得上届全国人代大会已有人提议及此。我们想现在来办，尚是及时的。谨撮要拟些实行纲要如下：
    1．编辑地方志暂以各省辖县、市和中央直辖市为限。省辖各县、市，由省督促进行。中央直辖市，由中央督促进行。均应于1958年内开始，并列于该省、市和直辖市行政计划预算之内。
    2．各方志的体例，其大纲由中央规定。亦得由各地方结合实际，增减变通，报由中央核定，然后着手。
    3．修志经费应由省和中央直辖市筹支；但以精简为准。例如地方耆宿和知识分子，统可延揽分工。采访、缮校，只须酌送津贴。印刷费可由售出价周转。
    4．地方各项统计图表和档案（如土地、中小型水利、户口、工、农、手工业、商业、赋税、交通、教育、卫生等），均应择要录副送交修志馆。修志馆亦可调取各项统计图表和档案来参考。
    5．各地行政及文教机关和其职教员，均有协助采访、搜集资料的义务。其工作得力者得给予奖励。
    6．中央在国务院内设修志指导委员会，专司各地区修志事项。各地区各设修志馆为常设机关。
    7．凡各地方不易自行办理事项，如地质、地形、生物、大型水利、大型测候、比较语言等可由中央修志指导委员会代觅资料，或商请有关机关协助采访征求。
    8．各地区有关志乘的图书、档案、稿本、校本、佚本，不论已刊、未刊，各修志馆应采访保存，如有重大发见和必要的处理为一地的力量所不能办者，得报请中央修志指导委员会办理。
    以上八条不过略举大纲，实行时尚须有更详密的规定。是否有当，敬请核议。
