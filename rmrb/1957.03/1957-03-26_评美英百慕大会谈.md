    Commentary on the US-British Bermuda Talks

    The meeting between the heads of the US and British governments, held at the request of Britain, concluded after three days of discussions from March 21st to 23rd. According to British Prime Minister Macmillan, the purpose of this meeting was to "eliminate any differences between Britain and the United States" and to "restore" Anglo-American relations. In other words, it was to mend the rift between the US and Britain that had widened after the failure of the invasion of Egypt. However, the joint communiqué of the Bermuda talks shows that the disputes between the US and Britain have not been eliminated by far, and Eisenhower did not treat Britain as an equal partner of the United States because of Macmillan's pleas.

    For some time, the most acute Anglo-American contradiction has been manifested in the Middle East issue. The gentlemen of Downing Street have always been extremely resentful of the situation in which their position in the Middle East has been gradually squeezed out by Uncle Sam. Before the Bermuda talks, British bourgeois public opinion had tried its best to spread the word that it would confront the United States on the Middle East issue, attempting to use the "future" of Anglo-American relations to force the United States to make concessions. However, it is on the Middle East issue that the results announced in the joint communiqué are the most empty. The joint communiqué stated that the US and Britain "agreed on the need to promptly implement the recent resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly regarding the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba"; "agreed on the importance of complying with the Security Council resolution of October 13 regarding the Suez Canal in letter and spirit, and agreed to support the Secretary-General's efforts to achieve a solution in accordance with the provisions of the resolution." Everyone knows that Britain has always been dissatisfied with the above-mentioned UN resolutions; while the United States has treated the above-mentioned UN resolutions with a hypocritical attitude, attempting to manipulate these resolutions to achieve its ulterior motives. This shows that on the Middle East issue, the US and Britain are still going their separate ways; Macmillan did not obtain any substantial concessions from Eisenhower.

    The joint communiqué also mentioned that the United States is "willing to actively participate in the work of the Baghdad Pact Military Committee in accordance with the recent Middle East joint resolution (i.e., the resolution of the US Senate and House of Representatives on the 'Eisenhower Doctrine')." Is this a kind of support from the United States to Britain in the Middle East? Judging from the degree of "warm welcome" expressed by the British side, it seems so. However, Britain's joy may be premature. Because, as the White House spokesman said, the US participation in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee is a "natural development" of the Eisenhower Doctrine, and even people in the British ruling group admit that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" aims to squeeze Britain out of the Middle East. Moreover, this "inevitable development" of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" was decided long before the Bermuda talks, and even the other member states of the Baghdad Pact knew the news before Britain was notified. Therefore, this move by the United States is not so much a support for Britain's position in the Middle East as it is a "reassurance" to the other member states of the Baghdad Pact. Its purpose is also to replace British influence with American influence.

    In Western Europe, Britain's plan to maintain its own interests and resist American economic forces through its proposed "free trade area" has also been restricted by the United States. Obviously due to American pressure, Britain had to guarantee that the future European Common Market or free trade area "would not lead to a high-tariff bloc," which is to guarantee the opening of the market to the United States. Who benefits from this, of course, does not need much explanation.

    The United States has, in principle, agreed to "provide some missiles for use by the British armed forces." However, this was also an agreement reached as early as January this year when British Defense Minister Sandys visited the United States, and the United States did not offer anything more at the Bermuda talks. Moreover, Britain's further reliance of its defense forces on American missiles enables the United States to further control Britain militarily; how can this be a good omen for Britain?

    The Bermuda talks show that because Britain is still unwilling to abandon its bankrupt colonial policy and is unwilling to adopt a more realistic attitude, it appears weak and powerless in the struggle to win great power status from the United States. Although Macmillan has the bold statement of not intending to be a vassal state, he fantasizes about relying on American support to maintain his colonial position, which is tantamount to seeking skin from a tiger, and the result will only be to further control the British Empire by the United States. However, this situation cannot ease the contradictions between the US and Britain. On the contrary, the more Britain suffers from American exclusion, the more unwilling it will be, and the more acute and profound its contradictions with the United States will become.

    This US-British Bermuda talks also provided an excellent lesson for all the people in the world who are fighting for peace and against colonialism. The "Eisenhower Doctrine," which had tried its best to paint a rosy picture for itself, finally revealed its true colors this time because the United States joined the Military Committee of the Baghdad Pact. The people of the Middle East and Near East can see more clearly that the "Eisenhower Doctrine," like the Baghdad Pact, is the most sinister tool used by colonialists to suppress the national independence movements of the Middle East and Near East countries. Although the United States is still arguing that joining the Military Committee does not mean becoming a formal member of the Baghdad Pact, attempting to ease the opposition from Arab countries, these lies can no longer deceive anyone.

    The US-British talks communiqué announced that they would not unconditionally stop nuclear tests and attempted to push the responsibility for their unwillingness to stop the tests onto the Soviet Union. However, the people of the world know that it was the Soviet Union that proposed the unconditional cessation of nuclear tests, and it is the US and Britain, especially the US imperialists, who are constantly flaunting nuclear "deterrence." This attitude of the US and Britain can only prove that they are unwilling to take even the slightest step forward in the direction of disarmament and easing international tensions.

### 评美英百慕大会谈

    评美英百慕大会谈
    在英国的要求下举行的美英两国政府首脑会谈，经过3月21日到23日三天的讨论，已告结束。这次会谈的目的，根据英国首相麦克米伦的说法，是为了“消除英美之间的任何分歧”和“恢复”英美关系。换句话说，也就是要弥补在侵埃战争失败后扩大了的美英之间的裂痕。但是，百慕大会谈的联合公报表明，英美之间的纠纷远没有消除，艾森豪威尔并没有因为麦克米伦的乞求而把英国作为美国的平等伙伴。
    若干时期以来，英美矛盾最尖锐地表现在中东问题上。唐宁街的绅士对于自己在中东的地位被山姆大叔所节节排挤的状况，从来都是极为恼恨的。在百慕大会谈之前，英国资产阶级舆论曾经竭力放出空气说要在中东问题上同美国摊牌，企图用英美关系的“前途”来压迫美国让步。但是，正是在中东问题上，会谈公报所宣布的结果最为空洞。联合公报说，美英“一致同意有必要迅速执行联合国大会最近有关加沙地带和亚喀巴湾的决议”；“一致同意在文字上和精神上遵守10月13日安全理事会关于苏伊士运河的决议的重要性，一致同意支持秘书长按照决议的规定实现解决的努力。”谁都知道，英国对于上述的联合国决议从来都是不满意的；而美国却是以口是心非的态度对待联合国的上述决议，企图玩弄这些决议以达到自己的不可告人的目的。这说明在中东问题上，美英依然是各走各的路；麦克米伦并没有从艾森豪威尔那里取得实际上的让步。
    联合公报又提到，美国“愿意根据最近的中东联合决议（即美国参众两院关于‘艾森豪威尔主义’的决议）积极参加巴格达条约军事委员会的工作”。这是不是美国在中东给予英国的一种支持呢？从英国方面所表示的“热烈欢迎”的程度看来，似乎是这样。但是，英国的高兴未免过早了。因为，如白宫的发言人所说的，美国参加巴格达条约军事委员会是艾森豪威尔主义的“一种必然发展”，而“艾森豪威尔主义”连英国统治集团的人士也承认是以在中东排挤英国为目的的。并且，“艾森豪威尔主义”的这个“必然发展”，是早在百慕大会谈以前就已决定了，甚至巴格达条约的其他成员国家，也早在英国被通知以前就知道了这个消息。因此，美国的这一步棋，与其说是对英国在中东地位的支持，不如说是给巴格达条约其他成员国的一粒
  “定心丸”。其目的，也是要以美国的影响来代替英国的影响。
    在西欧方面，英国企图通过它所建议的“自由贸易区”来维护自己的利益和抵抗美国的经济势力的计划，也受到了美国的限制。显然是由于美国的压力，英国不得不保证在将来成立的欧洲共同市场或自由贸易区“不会导致一种高关税集团”，这也就是保证向美国开放市场。这究竟对谁有利，当然是不用多加解释的了。
    美国在原则上同意“提供某些导弹，供英国军队使用”。但是，这也是早在今年1月英国国防大臣桑迪斯访美时就已达成了的协议，而在百慕大会谈中，美国并没有提供更多的东西。何况，英国把它的国防力量更进一步地依靠在美国的导弹上，这也就使美国能够进一步在军事上控制英国；这对于英国又何尝是吉祥之兆呢？
    百慕大会谈表明，由于英国还不肯放弃已经破了产的殖民政策，还不肯采取比较现实的态度，因而在向美国争取大国地位的斗争中就显得软弱无力。麦克米伦尽管有不打算作附庸国的豪语，却幻想依靠美国的支持来维持自己的殖民地位，这等于是与虎谋皮，结果只会使大英帝国进一步被美国所控制。但是，这种情况并不能缓和美、英之间的矛盾，相反地，英国越是遭受美国的排挤，它就越是不甘心，它同美国的矛盾也就越加尖锐、越加深刻。
    美英这次的百慕大会谈同时也是对世界上一切为和平和反对殖民主义而斗争的人民上了一堂极好的课。曾经极力为自己涂脂抹粉的
  “艾森豪威尔主义”，这次终于因美国参加了巴格达条约的军事委员会而原形毕露了。中近东各国人民可以更清楚地看到“艾森豪威尔主义”同巴格达条约一样是殖民主义者企图镇压中近东各国民族独立运动的最险恶的工具。尽管美国还在辩解说什么参加了军事委员会并不等于成为巴格达条约的正式成员，企图缓和阿拉伯各国的反对情绪，但是，这些鬼话再也骗不了人了。
    美英会谈公报宣布决不无条件地停止原子核试验，并企图把自己不肯停止试验的责任推到苏联身上。但是，世界人民都知道，提出无条件停止原子核试验的正是苏联，而不断炫耀原子核“威慑力量”的，正是美英特别是美帝国主义者。美英两国的这种态度，只能证明它们不肯向裁减军备和缓和国际紧张局势方面前进那怕是最微小的一步。
