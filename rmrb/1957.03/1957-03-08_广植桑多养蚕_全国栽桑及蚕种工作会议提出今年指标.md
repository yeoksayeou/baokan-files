Xinhua News Agency, Zhenjiang, March 6th: This year, the national total output of silkworm cocoons is required to increase by 170,000 dan compared to last year, and the area planted with mulberry trees is to be expanded from 3.25 million mu last year to 7.85 million mu. These are the targets set by the National Mulberry Planting and Silkworm Breeding Conference, which closed on the 5th. The conference was held in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, and lasted nine days.

The conference pointed out that the key to increasing silkworm cocoon production lies in changing the situation where mulberry leaf production cannot keep up with the needs of silkworm rearing. The representatives attending the meeting focused on studying how to increase the yield per unit area of existing mulberry orchards and how to expand new mulberry orchards on a large scale in a planned manner. Representatives from Jiangsu Province, a major silkworm cocoon producing area, said that Jiangsu Province has decided to collect seeds and cultivate seedlings on a large scale, and to expand new mulberry orchards on a large scale in the Xuhuai Plain and Zhenyang mountainous area. The province plans to cultivate and plant 2 billion mulberry seedlings in four years, expanding the mulberry orchard area from the current 550,000 mu to 3 million mu. Representatives from Zhejiang Province said that Zhejiang Province is prepared to continue popularizing and improving the "fast silkworm rearing method," saving mulberry leaves, increasing the leaf yield of existing mulberry orchards, and increasing the rearing of summer and autumn silkworms, striving to increase the province's total silkworm cocoon output from 550,000 dan last year to 600,000 dan this year.

The representatives exchanged experiences in silkworm production at the meeting. Sichuan Province attaches importance to seedling cultivation and mulberry planting, and has newly planted more than 400 million mulberry trees in the past three years, a tenfold increase compared to 1949. For existing mulberry trees, various places have also carried out pruning, pest control, and fertilization work based on different conditions such as tree age, variety, soil quality, and terrain. Representatives from Deqing County, Zhejiang Province, introduced the high-yield experience of the Xingfu Agricultural Cooperative, where the average cocoon production per mu of 400 mu of mulberry orchards was 160 jin. Due to the high yield of mulberry leaves, the cooperative raised silkworms four times last year, and the cocoon production per mu of mulberry orchard was twice as high as the local average cocoon production.

At the meeting, representatives from eleven provinces in the new silkworm areas, including Hubei, Shaanxi, and Gansu, determined after research: more than 30 new silkworm breeding farms will be built in the next five years, and by 1962, silkworm seed self-sufficiency will be achieved.

Note: China has a long history of silkworm production. Before liberation, due to the serious sabotage and destruction by Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, silkworm cocoon production gradually shrank. After several years of recovery and development since liberation, silkworm cocoon producing areas have expanded from nine provinces at the beginning of liberation to the current twenty provinces. Last year, the national total output of silkworm cocoons increased by 136% compared to 1949, and the average cocoon production per silkworm egg sheet increased by more than double compared to 1949. However, due to the excessive utilization of existing mulberry orchards and insufficient cultivation, low mulberry leaf yield; and poor management of newly developed mulberry orchards, resulting in a low rate of forestation, the speed of silkworm cocoon production recovery and growth has been affected. In recent years, the silkworm production in some old silkworm producing areas has shown a downward trend. The national total output of silkworm cocoons increased by an average of 33.6% per year from 1949 to 1952, while it only increased by an average of 4.4% per year from 1953 to 1956. In 1956, the national total output of silkworm cocoons only recovered to one-third of the historical peak total output in 1931. The existing silk production is far from meeting the needs of domestic and foreign markets.

    广植桑多养蚕
    全国栽桑及蚕种工作会议提出今年指标
    新华社镇江6日电　今年要求全国蚕茧总产量比去年增加十七万担，桑树种植面积从去年的三百二十五万亩扩大到七百八十五万亩。这是5日闭幕的全国栽桑及蚕种工作会议提出的指标。这次会议在江苏省镇江举行，历时九天。
      会议指出，蚕茧增产的关键在于改变桑叶生产跟不上养蚕需要的局面。到会代表着重研究了如何提高现有桑园的单位面积产量和如何有计划地大量增辟新桑园的问题。蚕茧主要产区江苏省的代表说，江苏省决定大量采种育苗，在徐淮平原和镇扬山区大规模地拓植新桑园；全省计划在四年内育苗栽桑二十亿株，把桑园面积从现在的五十五万亩扩大到三百万亩。浙江省的代表说，浙江省准备继续普及和提高“快速养蚕法”，节省桑叶，提高现有桑园的产叶量，增养夏蚕和秋蚕，争取今年全省蚕茧总产量从去年的五十五万担增加到六十万担。
    代表们在会上交流了蚕桑工作的经验。四川省重视育苗栽桑，最近三年中新栽桑树四亿多株，比1949年扩大了十倍。对于原有桑树，各地也根据树龄、品种、土质和地势等不同情况，开展了修剪、除虫、施肥工作。浙江省德清县的代表介绍了幸福农业社四百亩桑园平均每亩产茧一百六十斤的丰产经验。这个社由于桑叶产量高，去年养蚕四次，每亩桑园的产茧量比当地一般产茧量高一倍。
    会上，新蚕区湖北、陕西、甘肃等十一个省的代表在研究以后确定：在今后五年内新建三十多个蚕种场，到1962年做到蚕种自给自足。
    按：我国蚕桑生产历史悠久。解放前由于日本帝国主义和国民党反动派的严重破坏和摧残，使蚕茧生产日渐萎缩。经过解放后几年来的恢复和发展，蚕茧产区从刚解放时的九个省扩大到目前的二十个省。去年全国蚕茧总产量比1949年增加了136％，每张蚕种的平均产茧量比1949年提高了一倍以上。但是，由于对现有桑园利用多，培育少，桑叶产量低；对新开辟的桑园管理差，成林率低，以致影响了蚕茧生产恢复和增长的速度。近几年有些老蚕区的蚕桑生产有下降的趋势。全国蚕茧总产量在1949年到1952年平均每年增加33.6％，而1953年到1956年平均每年只增加4.4％。1956年全国蚕茧总产量仅恢复到历史上最高的1931年总产量的三分之一。现有丝绸产量远远不能满足国内外市场的需要。
