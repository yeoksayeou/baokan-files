They Have a Common Temperament
By Our Correspondent Gu Lei

With "March 8th" International Women's Day approaching, I especially think of a group of young female geological workers in the Qaidam Basin. In my mind's eye, I seem to see them again, heading into the wilderness against the wind and sand, laboriously climbing hills, overcoming various difficulties to discover underground treasures, and at the same time using song and dance to fill the Gobi Desert with vitality. All of this, although seen and heard in the basin last year, remains unforgettable to this day.

One day in October, I traveled from Da Qaidan to Nanbaxian to visit the Mahai Women's Geological Team.

Nanbaxian has only a few tents, like a few flat boats floating on a sea of sand. In the past, no one lived here, nor did it ever have a name. Our car stopped in front of two canvas tents here. Two members of the women's geological team ran out to greet us. These two girls were both wearing blue denim work clothes, with dark faces, short hair, and yellow suede shoes, like two sisters dressed up by a thrifty mother. They led me into the tent and sat on the floor. This tent, ten square meters in size, served as the dormitory, office, and dining room for the five members of the women's geological team. The simple furnishings in their tent reminded me of the life of nomads. The difference is: nomads travel on cattle and horses, while the women's geological team travels by car in search of oil, traversing the waterless and grassless Gobi and hills. After I started talking with the two girls who greeted us, I quickly realized that one of them was the innocent and cheerful Wang Yongling, and the other was the honest and calm Meng Zhaoxi. Because, two days earlier, the captain of the women's geological team, Jiang Dexin, had given me a detailed introduction to their team's lineup.

Looking at her, Wang Yongling still seemed like a child, even though she was already eighteen years old. She laughed constantly when she spoke. She was uninhibited in talking about anything, but she often blushed and covered her face with her hands from time to time. She was an intern and had been working in the field for less than a year, but she had already developed a character that was not afraid of difficulties.

A few days ago, Wang Yongling and Xiao Xie went out to work together. Xiao Xie, who was twenty years old this year, was a student at the Beijing Institute of Geology and was interning in the basin temporarily. The place they were going was a swampy area in a corner of Dezun Mahai. The shallow salt water emitted a pungent odor, and many green and red dirty things floated on the surface of the water. On some of the shallows, there were still some footprints of wild animals. Wang Yongling and Xiao Xie walked in the mud, their big leather shoes seemed to be cast from iron, and the muddy ground seemed to be filled with enormous magnetic force, so that every step they took required great effort. In this desolate place, were there any water snakes in the water? Would they encounter wild animals? They didn't consider these things, but just walked with laughter and talk in the mud the road they had to take. All day long, the only companions of these two young girls besides the mud and withered grass were the floating clouds in the sky and the uninhibited wind.

When the sun set into the earth, Wang Yongling led Xiao Xie back. The more they walked, the darker it became. They were not walking the original road, but through an area four kilometers wide, with knee-deep water and grass taller than a person. They used their hands to push the grass aside as they walked forward. At this time, their pants were wet, their bodies gradually became cold, and the speed of their advance slowed down. Just then, Wang Yongling suddenly discovered that not far ahead in the grass, a wild animal was squatting, with two eyes emitting two beams of light. This light flickered from time to time, and it was chilling. The wild animal swayed its body, as if about to jump up. Wang Yongling and Xiao Xie immediately stopped and each grabbed their only "weapon" - a geological hammer. Later, the wild animal ran away on its own. Wang Yongling jokingly said: "This thing must be afraid of not being able to beat us, so it ran away. Otherwise, we would have beaten it to death and carried it back, and we could have had a big meal!"

Why didn't Wang Yongling panic and run away from her work in front of the wild animal? Was it because she didn't know how powerful the wild animal was, or was it the high level of enthusiasm for work that encouraged her? Both were present, but the latter was the source of her courage and calmness. When Wang Yongling was still studying at a vocational school in Xi'an, she was always thinking: hurry up and go out to work, otherwise the first five-year plan will be over, and I haven't contributed a single strength! As soon as she graduated, she asked to go to Qaidam. When she entered the basin, every step she took, every unusual geological phenomenon she saw, every fossil she encountered, every geological point she marked out, she felt was particularly meaningful. She was growing rapidly in a strong collective and a hard life. Qaidam often gives people severe tests, using heat, cold, wind, sand, mosquitoes, and dryness to measure everyone's enthusiasm for building socialism, and at the same time gives people great encouragement. When the news of oil production in Lenghu and Mangai spread throughout the basin and the country, they felt that suffering was a glory and fighting difficulties was a happiness.

Once, Meng Zhaoxi and Wang Yongling set off with temporary worker Lao Zhang to work in a place more than ten miles away. In the past, everyone had to bring a pot of water when they set off. This day, the water truck had not yet returned, and the water at home was also used up. What to do? It just so happened that the previous night, comrades from another geological team had asked someone to buy a watermelon from Xining and divided half of it to the women's team. They ate a meal. Because they were too modest, there were still two thin slices left. Everyone advised Meng Zhaoxi and Wang Yongling to each take a slice. In addition, they put together a pot of water for temporary worker Lao Zhang.

This day, the Gobi Desert was very hot. There were no trees here, and no place to find shade. There was no high mountain here, and no shady place to rest. The sun, like a large coal ball hanging in the air and burning, not far from the top of the head, made people feel anxious. The Gobi, like a flat pan扣on top of a blazing fire, was baking people so that they could not breathe.

At noon, they sat on a sand ridge to rest. At this time, there was no moist feeling in their mouths at all, and their heads were also dizzy. Meng Zhaoxi calmly considered this situation. What if she wanted to continue working but became dehydrated? If she wanted to go home, it would not be good to not complete the work task! So she discussed it with Wang Yongling and sent Lao Zhang out to see if there were any other teams active nearby, or if there were any passing water trucks. Lao Zhang ran out from the left and came back after a long time, saying that he hadn't seen anything. They mobilized Lao Zhang to run again. Lao Zhang ran out from the right again, and after a long time, he came back and said that he had found a bucket in a place.

On the way back, Meng Zhaoxi and Wang Yongling even thought of giving a name to the place where they had worked during the day. After thinking about it, they both said that it would be best to call it "Happiness Beach." When they reported to everyone at home, many people asked the "naming people" to explain the reasons. They said: "There is no other reason. If you want to drink water, there is water. You can eat watermelon in hot weather and complete the work task smoothly. Can you say that this is not happiness!" The two words "happiness" had a noble explanation in the hearts of Meng Zhaoxi and Wang Yongling, that is: participating in the great construction cause, not being afraid of difficulties, and completing the task.

Although the time I spent with all the comrades of the Mahai Women's Geological Team was short, I heard many things that seemed ordinary but were actually very difficult to do. In the lives of each of them, similar stories to those of Meng Zhaoxi and Wang Yongling have happened. In fact, it's not just the Mahai Women's Geological Team! After I left Nanbaxian, I traveled through many places in the basin and knew that many young women in the basin were excellent. The women's teams active in the Delingha and Gansen areas also worked selflessly like the Mahai Women's Team. They came from all over the country. Most of them were no more than twenty-three years old. They all grew up in schools, and none of them had experienced such a life in the Qaidam Basin. However, in order to find oil, they voluntarily asked to go to the basin. In the windy and sandy spring, hot summer, and unpredictable autumn days in the basin, their white faces were tanned, their delicate skin was made rough by the wind and sand, and their comfortable lives were replaced by hard lives. At the same time, they were also far away from their relatives. Some of them had lovers but had not yet married, and their lovers were not by their side, some were thousands of miles apart, it could be said that they were "north and south!" In the days of tense work and overcoming difficulties, their hearts did not harden. They often missed their relatives in the distance during their spare time. When they returned after completing their work tasks, they beat gasoline drums or washbasins, blew harmonicas or played phonographs, and danced on the sand. In their hearts, the desire to celebrate the victory of work and relieve work fatigue was intertwined with the emotion of dispelling the loneliness of life. Some people sat outside the tent and sang a Qinghai folk song affectionately:

		Three strings are played, four strings help,
		Pipa and yangqin are in pairs;
		I play here, you think there,
		You and I miss each other in two places!

The singing flowed to the distant Gobi. There was longing in the singing, but no sadness. Everyone of them knew that this separation was only temporary, and therefore also pleasant. Jiang Dexin, the captain of the Mahai Women's Team, came out of Beijing entirely at her own repeated request. She felt that going to Qaidam could better train herself. She told her lover this wish, and not only did she get her lover's understanding, but she also got her support. After arriving in the basin, she worked hard and often sent her distant lover her joyful feelings when she won the victory of work and greetings to her lover, and she also often received more encouragement and care from her lover. Then who would say that this distant miss has no benefits! Shouldn't those who scold the "ruthless Milky Way" for separating them for three days feel ashamed in front of them!

I remember when I was in Mangai, a comrade asked me: "Have you seen the character of our basin girls?" At that time, I couldn't answer. I knew that each of them had different looks, hobbies, habits, and personalities, which could not be summarized by the same concept. Now, as I recall the impressions I gained in the past, I also feel that the young female geological workers in Qaidam still have a common temperament. Because they are engaged in the same cause and are trained in the same environment, they have all become brave, tenacious, joyful, enthusiastic people with a desire to keep moving forward!

    她们有共同的气质
    本报记者　顾雷
    “三八节”要到了，我特别想起柴达木盆地里一群年青的女地质人员。在我眼前，像是又出现了她们迎着风沙走向旷野，艰难地翻越山丘，战胜各种困难发掘地下宝藏，同时用歌舞使戈壁滩上充满生气的情景。这一切，虽然是去年在盆地里看到、听到的，至今却久久不能忘记。
    10月里的一天，我从大柴旦到南八仙，去访问马海女子地质分队。
    南八仙只有几座帐篷，像飘在沙的海洋上的几叶扁舟。过去，这里没有人住，也不曾有过名字。在这里的两个帆布帐篷跟前，我们的汽车停住了。女子地质队的两个队员跑出来迎接我们。这两个女孩子都穿着蓝色劳动布工作服，面孔黝黑，头上留着短发，脚穿黄色的翻皮鞋，像是被一位勤俭的母亲打扮起来的俩姊妹。她们带着我走进帐篷，坐在地铺上。这座帐篷有十平方公尺大，是女子地质队五位队员的宿舍、办公室和食堂。她们帐篷里简单的摆设，使我联想到牧民的生活。所不同的是：牧民们动身骑牛马，女子地质队行动时坐汽车；牧民们逐水草而居，女子地质队为寻找石油而遍越无水无草的戈壁和山丘。当我同迎接我们的两位姑娘开始谈话以后，很快就发觉其中一个是天真爱笑的王永玲，另一个是老诚沉静的孟昭玺。因为，前两天女子地质队队长江德昕曾经向我详细介绍了她们队的阵容。
    看去，王永玲还完全是一个小孩子，虽说她已十八岁了。她说话的时候，笑声不断。她无论谈什么事都不拘束，然而却常常红脸，不时地用双手把脸捂住。她是个实习生，到野外工作还不到一年，但是已经锻炼成了一种不怕困难的性格。
    前些日子，王永玲和小谢一块出去工作。小谢今年二十岁，是北京地质学院的学生，临时到盆地实习的。她们要去的地方，是得尊马海一角的一片泥沼地带。浅浅的咸水散发出刺鼻的臭气，水面上浮着许多绿色、红色的脏东西。有的浅滩上，还留着一些野兽的足印。王永玲、小谢走在泥水里，大皮鞋像是铁铸成的，泥泞的大地像充满了巨大的磁力，使她们每走一步都要付出很大的力量。在这荒凉的地方，水里有没有水蛇呢？会不会遇见野兽呢？她们没有考虑这些，只是有说有笑地在泥水中走着必须走的路。一整天过去了，陪伴着这两个小姑娘的除了泥水和枯草以外，就是天边的浮云、无拘无束的风了。
    太阳栽进大地的时候，王永玲带着小谢往回走，愈走天愈黑了。她们走的不是原来的路，而是通过一块宽四公里、水有没膝深、草比人还高的地方。她们用手扒开草往前走，这时裤子湿了，身上渐渐冷了，行进的速度慢下来了。就在这时候，王永玲突然发现前边不远的草棵里，蹲着一只野兽，两只眼射出两道光芒，这光芒时时闪动，这光芒令人不寒而栗。那只野兽摇晃着身躯，像要跳起。王永玲和小谢马上停下来，各自抓紧了身边唯一的“武器”——地质锤。后来，到底是野兽自己逃跑了。王永玲还打趣地说：“这玩艺准是怕打不过咱们才跑的。要不然，咱们把它打死背回去，还可以大吃一顿呢！”
    王永玲为什么没有在野兽的面前惊惶失措、丢开工作跑掉呢？是不知道野兽的厉害，还是高度的工作热情鼓舞着她呢？两者俱在，然而后一个却是她勇敢、沉着的源泉。王永玲还在西安一个专科学校上学的时候，就时刻想着：赶快出去工作吧，不然第一个五年计划完了，自己还没出一份力量呢！刚毕业，她就要求到柴达木。进了盆地，每走一步，每看见一种不寻常的地质现象，每遇见一块化石，每标出一个地质点，她都觉得特别有意义。她在坚强的集体中、艰苦的生活里迅速地成长着。柴达木经常加给人们严厉的考验，它用酷热、严寒、风沙、蚊虫、干燥，测量着每个人建设社会主义的热情，同时也给人们以极大的鼓舞。当冷湖、茫崖出油的消息风传盆地和全国的时候，她们觉得吃苦是一种光荣，同困难斗争是一种幸福。
    有一次，孟昭玺、王永玲带着临时工老张，出发到十几里以外的地方去工作。过去出发的时候，每人都要带一壶水。这天，拉水的车还没有回来，家里的水也吃光了。怎么办呢？正巧，头一天晚上另外一个地质分队的同志，托人从西宁买回一个西瓜，分了一半给女子分队。她们吃了一顿，由于过于谦让，还剩下薄薄的两片，大家便劝孟昭玺、王永玲各带一片，另外，凑了一壶水给临时工老张。
    这天，戈壁滩上很热。这里没有树木，找不到乘凉的地方。这里没有一座高山，找不到阴凉处休息。太阳，像离头顶不远，吊在空中正在燃烧的大煤球，晒得令人心焦。戈壁，像是扣在熊熊大火上面的平锅，烙得人透不过气来。
    中午，她们坐在一个沙梁子上休息。这时，嘴里完全没有湿润的感觉了，头也在发晕。孟昭玺沉着地考虑了这一情况，有心继续工作，人渴坏了怎么办呢？有心回家，没有完成工作任务也不好啊！便同王永玲商量，派老张出去找找，看有没有别的分队在附近活动，是不是有过路的水车。老张从左面跑出去，好久才回来，说什么也没有看见。她们又动员老张再跑一趟。老张又从右面跑出去，隔了很长时间，才回来说在有个地方找到了水桶。
    在回来的路上，孟昭玺和王永玲竟想起要给白天工作过的地方起个名字。想来想去，都说叫“幸福滩”最好。到家里向大家一报告，许多人要求“命名人”说明理由，她们俩说：“没有别的理由，想喝水有水，热天里吃西瓜，顺利完成工作任务，能说这不是幸福吗！”“幸福”这两个字，在孟昭玺、王永玲的心里，有了高尚的解释，这就是：参与伟大的建设事业，不怕困难，完成任务。
    我同马海女子地质分队全体同志相处的时间虽短，听到的看来平凡、实际上很不容易做到的事情却很多。在她们每个人的生活里，都发生过类似孟昭玺、王永玲那样的故事。其实，又何止是马海女子地质队呢！我离开南八仙以后，曾走过盆地许多地方，知道盆地很多的女青年都是好样的。在德令哈、甘森一带活动的女子分队，也同马海女子队一样忘我地工作。她们来自全国各地，她们中的绝大部分人不超过二十三岁，都是在学校里长大的，没有谁经历过柴达木盆地里这样的生活。但是，她们为了寻找石油，自动要求到了盆地。在盆地多风沙的春天、炎热的夏天、冷热无常的秋天的日子里，她们白白的面孔被晒黑了，细腻的皮肤被风沙打磨得粗糙了，舒适的生活被艰苦的生活代替了。同时，她们还远离开了自己的亲人。她们中间有的人有了爱人还没有结婚，爱人都不在身边，有的相距数千里，可谓是“天南地北”了！在紧张工作、战胜困难的日子里，她们的心肠并没有变硬，她们在工作之余也常想念远方亲人。她们完成工作任务回来，便敲着汽油桶或脸盆，吹着口琴或放留声机，在沙地上跳舞。在她们的心里，庆祝工作胜利、解除工作疲劳的愿望同驱散生活寂寞的感情是交织在一起的。有的人坐在帐篷外面，多情地唱着一支青海民歌：
        三弦弹来四弦帮，
        琵琶洋琴两对上；
        我这里弹来你那里想，
        你和我两地相挂念啊！
    歌声向远方的戈壁流去。歌声里有思念，但没有忧伤。她们每一个人都知道，这种别离只不过是暂时的，因而也是愉快的。马海女子队队长江德昕，从北京走出来的时候，完全是自己再三要求的，她觉得到柴达木，能更好地锻炼自己。她把这种愿望告诉了爱人，不但得到爱人的理解，也得到了支持。到了盆地以后，她努力地工作，常常给远方的爱人寄去工作胜利时候喜悦的心情和对爱人的问候，也常常从爱人那里得到更多的鼓励和体贴。那么有谁会说这种远方的思念没有好处呢！难道那些因为分别三天而大骂“无情天河”的人，不应该在她们的面前感到羞愧吗！
    记得我在茫崖的时候，一位同志问我：“看见我们盆地姑娘们的性格了没有？”当时，我答复不出来。我知道她们每一个人，都有和别人不同的面貌、爱好、习惯、性格，是无法用同一个概念加以概括的。现在，我重新回忆过去获得的印象，又觉得柴达木女青年地质工作者们，还是有共同气质的。因为她们进行同一个事业、经受同一个环境的锻炼，她们都同样变成勇敢、坚韧、欢乐、热情、具有不断前进愿望的人了！（附图片）
