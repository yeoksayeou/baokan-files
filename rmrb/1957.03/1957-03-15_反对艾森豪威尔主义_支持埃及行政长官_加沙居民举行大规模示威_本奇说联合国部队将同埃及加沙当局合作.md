Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 14th: Gaza City News: Thousands upon thousands of residents in various parts of the Gaza Strip held large-scale demonstrations on March 13th, opposing the Eisenhower Doctrine and supporting the Egyptian-appointed administrator of the Gaza region.

　　From dawn, the streets of Gaza City, decorated with flowers and arches, were filled with crowds. They held Egyptian flags and various other flags, with the words "Gaza is Egyptian and Arab" and "Long Live Nasser" written on them in Arabic and English.

　　The procession began at eight o'clock Greenwich time. Led by the Mayor of Gaza, Rayyes, the demonstrating men, women, young and old, chanted "We want Egypt" and "Down with the Eisenhower Doctrine" along the way.

　　The marching crowd shouted in front of the United Nations Emergency Force headquarters in Gaza: "Down with the imperialist plan to internationalize Gaza!"

　　Similar demonstrations were also held in other cities in the Gaza Strip, including Khan Yunis, Deir al-Balah, and Rafah.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 14th: UN Under-Secretary-General Bunch told reporters on March 13th after meeting with Egyptian President Nasser that the UN Emergency Force would fully cooperate with the newly appointed Egyptian Gaza administration.

　　Bunch reiterated that the UN Emergency Force had no intention of internationalizing the Gaza Strip. He stated that the UN Emergency Force was not attempting to delay the entry of the Egyptian administration into Gaza.

　　Bunch said: "The UN Emergency Force is not an administrative authority in Gaza." He said: The status of the UN forces in Gaza is the same as in Port Said.

　　A reporter asked when the UN Emergency Force would be concentrated on the armistice line. Bunch said that the responsibility of the UN Emergency Force was to be stationed on the armistice line between the conflicting parties, and that the majority of the UN Emergency Force had already moved to the armistice line.

　　During his meeting with Nasser, Bunch, on behalf of UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and in his own name, expressed his apologies for the shooting death of a Palestinian youth by the UN Emergency Force on March 10th. He stated that all steps would be taken to prevent a recurrence of such unfortunate incidents.

　　The UN office in Cairo denied on March 13th that the UN Emergency Force had signed a one-year contract for the supply of goods. It said that the contract was signed on a monthly basis. The UN office also denied that the UN Emergency Force had placed barbed wire and laid landmines on the routes in the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula.

    反对艾森豪威尔主义  支持埃及行政长官
    加沙居民举行大规模示威
    本奇说联合国部队将同埃及加沙当局合作
    据新华社开罗14日电  加沙城消息：加沙地带各地成千上万的居民在3月13日举行了大规模的示威游行，反对艾森豪威尔主义，支持埃及任命的加沙地区行政长官。
    从清晨起，在布置了鲜花和扎了牌楼的加沙城的街道上，就挤满了人群。他们举着埃及国旗和各式各样的旗帜，旗帜上面用阿拉伯文和英文写着：“加沙是埃及的和阿拉伯的”，“纳赛尔万岁”。
    游行从格林威治时间八时开始。示威的男女老少在加沙市长拉耶斯的率领下沿途高呼“我们要埃及”“打倒艾森豪威尔主义”。
    游行的队伍在加沙的联合国紧急部队总部前高呼：“打倒要使加沙国际化的帝国主义计划！”
    在加沙地带的其它城市汉尤尼斯、德尔巴拉和拉法也举行了类似的示威游行。
    据新华社开罗14日电  联合国副秘书长本奇3月13日在同埃及总统纳赛尔会谈以后对新闻记者说，联合国紧急部队同埃及新任命的加沙行政当局将充分合作。
    本奇重申，联合国紧急部队不打算使加沙地带国际化。他表示，联合国紧急部队并不企图使埃及行政当局推迟进入加沙。
    本奇说：“联合国紧急部队在加沙不是行政当局”。他说：联合国部队在加沙的地位同在塞得港的地位是一样的。
    有记者问，联合国紧急部队将在什么时候集中到停战线上。本奇说，联合国紧急部队的责任是要驻在冲突双方之间的停战线上，而且联合国紧急部队的大部分部队现在已经开到停战线上。
    本奇在同纳赛尔会谈时，曾经代表联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德并且以他自己的名义，为3月10日联合国紧急部队开枪打死一名巴勒斯坦青年这件事表示歉意。他表示将采取一切步骤防止这种不幸事件重演。
    开罗的联合国办事处3月13日否认联合国紧急部队签订了为期一年的物品供应合同。它说，合同是在逐月的基础上签订的。联合国办事处还否认联合国紧急部队在加沙地带和西奈半岛的通道上安置铁丝网和埋设地雷。
