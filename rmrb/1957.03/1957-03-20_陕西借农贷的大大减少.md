    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: As agricultural cooperatives in Shaanxi Province generally pay attention to running the cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and as a result of saving expenses in many ways, the spring production loans borrowed from the state banks this year have decreased by 71% compared with the same period last year.

    This year, many agricultural cooperatives in Xianyang, Jingyang, Sanyuan, Lintong, Weinan, and the suburbs of Xi'an, when formulating spring production plans, educated their members on running the cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and saving expenses. Some agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Xi'an also stipulated that, on the premise of not affecting increased production, the investment in each mu of cultivated land in spring plowing should generally not exceed 15% of the income. The Mijiaya Agricultural Cooperative originally planned to spend more than 1,100 yuan to purchase small farm tools. After calculating the accounts, the members took out their own small farm tools that could still be used at home, and added steel and iron to more than 200 old and waste farm tools, which solved the needs of spring plowing production.

    Agricultural cooperatives in cotton-growing areas often spend a lot of money purchasing commercial fertilizers. This year, many cooperatives mobilized their members to accumulate fertilizer to reduce this expense. For example, the Xiaoguang No. 1 Cooperative in Xianyang County originally planned to borrow 50,000 jin of chemical fertilizer from the state. Later, the members tried everything possible to dig up manure from pigpens, exchange old walls and old kangs (platform bed), and sweep up accumulated dust, which basically solved the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer and eliminated the need to borrow from the state.

    陕西借农贷的大大减少
    据新华社讯　陕西省的农业社普遍注意勤俭办社，从多方面节约开支的结果，今年向国家银行所借的春季生产贷款比去年同期减少了71％。
    今年，咸阳、泾阳、三原、临潼、渭南和西安市郊区等地的许多农业社在制定春季生产计划的时候，都向社员进行过勤俭办社、节约开支的教育。西安市郊区有些农业社还规定在不影响增产的前提下，春耕生产中每亩耕地的投资一般不得超过收益的15％。米家崖农业社原计划用一千一百多元购置小农具，算账后，社员拿出了自己家中还可以使用的自有小农具，又把二百多件旧、废农具拿出加钢加铁，便解决了春耕生产的需要。
    棉区农业社购置商品肥料往往开支很大。今年许多社发动社员积肥减少了这项开支。如咸阳县晓光一社原计划向国家贷款购买五万斤化学肥料，后来社员们想尽一切办法挖圈底、换旧墙旧炕，扫积灰尘，基本上解决了肥料不足的困难，不需向国家贷款了。
