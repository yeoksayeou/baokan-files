The Hebei Provincial Health Department issued a "Notice Regarding Launching the Spring Patriotic Health Campaign" on February 25th, requiring all localities to seize the opportunity, building upon the Spring Festival clean-up, and combine it with spring plowing and fertilizer accumulation to launch a mass spring patriotic health campaign.

The notice emphatically pointed out: In the spring patriotic health campaign, efforts should be made to remove manure and garbage, dig and smash fly pupae, and continue to eliminate overwintering mosquitoes and flies, as well as rats and sparrows. Cities and towns are required to avoid accumulating garbage and manure, fill in sewage pits where possible, dredge open and concealed ditches, improve environmental sanitation conditions where mosquitoes and flies easily overwinter and breed, and use 666 and 223 smoke to fumigate or spray. Rural areas should conscientiously remove manure and garbage inside and around villages, improve manure pits and toilets, and move manure outside the village for centralized treatment as much as possible; manure that cannot be transported out in time should be sealed with mud as much as possible to kill germs and parasite eggs in the manure and reduce the breeding conditions for flies. Disaster areas should closely integrate production and disaster relief, strive to improve the people's health conditions, and prevent the spread of diseases. Special attention should be paid to improving the living and living conditions of migrant workers on water conservancy construction sites to ensure hygiene and safety, and prevent and reduce illnesses and injuries. All localities should make full use of various effective methods to widely capture and kill rats and sparrows and block sparrow nests and rat holes. The counties above the dam in Zhangjiakou Special Zone should continue to organize the masses to carry out a rat extermination campaign. Areas where Kala-azar (Leishmaniasis) is prevalent should eliminate its breeding conditions and do a good job in prevention. In this campaign, local health administrative departments should take the initiative to obtain close cooperation from relevant departments, give full play to the leading role of the Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, and gradually regularize the patriotic health campaign by improving various systems.
