    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 6th - Czechoslovak Radio broadcast in full on the 5th the report by Czechoslovak First Deputy Prime Minister Duransky at the recent CPC Central Committee Plenary Session, entitled "Striving to Improve the Efficiency of the Czechoslovak National Economy."
    In his report, Duransky said that the smooth development of the Czechoslovak national economy is the most important condition for consolidating the people's democratic system. In 1956, the growth rate of Czechoslovak industrial production was 9.5%. The current industrial production volume has increased to 2.7 times the 1937 level. In 1956, the country produced 68 million tons of coal, 3.3 million tons of pig iron, and 4.9 million tons of steel.
    The output of agricultural products has also greatly increased. Last year, 1,221 advanced forms of unified agricultural cooperatives were newly built nationwide. At present, the total number of unified agricultural cooperatives has reached 8,016, possessing 33% of the country's cultivated land.
    In 1956, individual consumption increased by 7%.
    Duransky said that although great achievements have been made in developing the national economy, there are still shortcomings and difficulties. This primarily involves excessive expenditure on the total wage bill, failure to comply with technological regulations, and imperfect production organization and leadership.
    Duransky pointed out that in overcoming existing shortcomings and difficulties, the basic task is to more effectively utilize all resources and potential in our national economy. The current main task in industrial development is to ensure increased coal mining, more effective use of metals in industry and other sectors, overcoming the backward state of the chemical industry, and maximizing fuel conservation.
    In order to increase agricultural output by 30% before 1960, it is first necessary to further develop and strengthen unified agricultural cooperatives and to fully utilize local natural economic resources and technical equipment.
    Duransky said that in the current situation, increasing the total amount of investment in capital construction beyond the level specified in the instructions of the Second Five-Year Plan is not the way out. The problem can only be solved by improving the efficiency of capital construction and reducing its costs.
    When talking about the proportionate development of various regions of the country, Duransky mentioned the industrialization achievements of Slovakia. He said that compared with 1948, Slovakia's industrial production has tripled, and agricultural production has increased by 29%. Industry has become the main economic sector in Slovakia, and the number of people employed in industry has increased by 120,000 in recent times. The structure of industrial production has also undergone significant changes. The socialist component in Slovak agriculture has reached 42.3% of the entire agriculture. People's living standards have significantly improved.
    Duransky continued, "The essence of our struggle to improve the efficiency of the national economy is to learn to better utilize the advantages contained in our social system, that is, to better organize and develop the people's infinite creativity, and to constantly and more broadly actively participate in the work of developing the socialist economy." In improving economic leadership, our goal is first to shift the focus of leadership to the lower levels, so as to make leadership more decisive, specific, and practical.
    Subsequently, Duransky emphasized that planning work, as the basic tool for leading the socialist economy, should be further strengthened and the party's leading role should be enhanced.
    Finally, Duransky talked about the current tasks of developing the Czechoslovak national economy.

    杜兰斯基在捷共中央全会上作报告
    号召发挥潜力保证国民经济不断高涨
    新华社布拉格6日电　捷克斯洛伐克电台5日全文广播了捷克斯洛伐克第一副总理杜兰斯基在最近举行的捷共中央全会上所作的“争取提高捷克斯洛伐克国民经济的效率”的报告。
    杜兰斯基在报告中说，捷克斯洛伐克国民经济的顺利发展是巩固人民民主制度的最重要条件。1956年捷克斯洛伐克工业生产增长额为9.5％。现在的工业生产量增加到了1937年水平的二点七倍。1956年全国生产了六千八百万吨煤，三百三十万吨生铁，四百九十万吨钢。
    农产品产量也大大提高。去年全国新建了一千二百二十一个高级形式的统一农业合作社。目前，统一农业合作社的总数达到了八千零一十六个，它们拥有占全国耕地面积33％的耕地。
    1956年的个人消费量提高了7％。
    杜兰斯基说，在发展国民经济方面虽然取得了很大的成就，但是缺点和困难还是有的。这首先涉及到工资总额支出过多，工艺规程没有得到遵守，生产组织和生产领导还不完善。
    杜兰斯基指出，在克服现有缺点和困难方面，基本任务是更加有效地利用我们国民经济中的一切资源和潜力。而工业发展方面当前的主要任务是保证提高采煤量，在工业和其他部门中更加有效地利用金属，克服化学工业的落后状态以及最大限度地节约燃料。
    为了把农业产量在1960年以前提高30％，这首先要进一步发展和加强统一农业合作社，并且要充分利用地方上的天然经济财富和技术装备。
    杜兰斯基说，在目前情况下，把基本建设投资总量增加到超出第二个五年计划指示规定的水平，并不是出路。问题只有通过提高基本建设的效能和减低它的成本来解决。
    杜兰斯基在谈到国内各个地区按比例发展的问题时谈到了斯洛伐克的工业化成果。他说，同1948年相比，斯洛伐克的工业生产量增加到三倍，农业生产增加了29％。工业在斯洛伐克成了主要的经济部门，工业中的就业人数在最近期间增加了十二万人。工业生产的结构也发生了重大变化。斯洛伐克农业中的社会主义成分达到了整个农业的42.3％。人民的生活水平有显著提高。
    杜兰斯基接着说，我们为提高国民经济的效率而斗争的实质是，学习更好地利用我们的社会制度所包含的优越性，也就是更好地组织和发展人民无穷的创造力，并且不断地使他们更广泛地积极参加发展社会主义经济的工作。在改善经济领导方面，我们的目标首先是把领导的重心转移到下层去，以便使领导更加干脆、具体和切实有效。
    随后，杜兰斯基又强调指出应当进一步加强作为领导社会主义经济的基本工具的计划工作和提高党的领导作用。
    最后，杜兰斯基谈到了发展捷克斯洛伐克国民经济的当前任务。
