Xinhua News Agency, March 5th. According to TASS: The Soviet Union trains twice as many professional engineers, in proportion to its total population, as Britain. This was stated by Goodall, a member of the British engineers' delegation that visited the Soviet Union last year, at a recent press conference.

The head of the delegation, Giffen, said at the press conference that the quality of Soviet engineers is very good. One of the biggest differences between the Soviet Union and Britain is the large proportion of women working in technical departments. In Britain, women as engineers are still extremely rare. The level of teaching staff in the Soviet Union is very high, and many department heads, professors, and principals are outstanding figures.

    英国工程师访苏后赞扬苏联工程教育
    据新华社5日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联培养的职业工程师的人数，就人口总数的比例来说，比英国要多两倍。这是去年访问苏联的英国工程师代表团的一个团员古道尔最近在记者招待会上说的。
    这个代表团的团长吉芬在招待会上说，苏联工程师的素质很好。而苏联和英国最大的不同点之一，是妇女参加技术部门工作的比例大。在英国，妇女当工程师还是绝无仅有的事。苏联教学工作人员的水平都很高，许多系的领导人、教授、校长都是出色的人物。
