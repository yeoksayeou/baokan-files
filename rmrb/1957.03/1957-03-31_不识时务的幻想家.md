Recently, some British people seem to have developed a great interest in Taiwan. They have been running around there, making all sorts of gestures of goodwill towards the Chiang Kai-shek clique. In January, Crozier, the former editor of the British magazine "The Economist," visited Taiwan. In early March, Tilling, a Conservative member of the British Parliament, conducted activities in Taiwan. Officials from the British Board of Trade also went to Taiwan to investigate trade issues. Following this, a so-called "British Friendly Visiting Group" also went. An Associated Press dispatch from Taipei on March 21 reported: "The number of British people now coming to this island to investigate the situation in Taiwan is unprecedented." Moreover, these people are only the vanguards; it is said that in the summer, even more "important" British figures will visit Taiwan.

Are so many British people coming to Taiwan in an endless stream all for sightseeing? Of course not. Many of them harbor certain political motives. It is reported that after Crozier returned to his country from Taiwan, he vigorously advocated that Britain should de facto recognize Taiwan and establish working relations with it. Tilling went even further, suggesting the promotion of "close relations" between Britain and the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan. During his visit to Taiwan, he even openly talked about the so-called "war in a general sense" and generously promised the Chiang Kai-shek clique: "Once a war breaks out, Britain will fight alongside Taiwan (!)"

We cannot say that these remarks by people like Tilling were made without thinking, nor can we say that there were no other people directing them from behind. These activities of Tilling and his ilk show that certain British groups who have always been interested in creating "two Chinas" are stirring again. These people know perfectly well that Britain recognizes the People's Republic of China, but they deliberately want to deal with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan, bolster the Chiang Kai-shek clique's prestige, and create a smokescreen in front of the British people: as if Taiwan is also a "China."

Needless to say, these activities of Tilling and his ilk are welcomed by the United States. Recently, the United States has been trying every possible means to strengthen its control over Taiwan in order to turn Taiwan into a U.S. dependency and prevent the Chinese people from peacefully liberating their own territory. Precisely at this time, some people in the British ruling group have gone to Taiwan with great effort to pay "friendly" visits. Precisely at this time, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which has caused many British merchant ships to suffer greatly for several years, has suddenly received all kinds of flattery from a large group of British people. Is this accidental? It is very obvious that these British people do not necessarily have so much friendship with the Chiang Kai-shek clique; they are merely using this to express their flattery to the United States. Some people in the British ruling group are accustomed to doing this kind of diplomatic deal: making certain compromises to the United States on Far Eastern issues and sacrificing the interests of third parties in exchange for U.S. concessions to Britain in other regions. But this diplomatic "formula" is not so effective, and it often backfires. The recent U.S.-British Bermuda talks are an example.

If the activities of people like Tilling are not stopped, they will only harm Sino-British relations and bring adverse factors to the Far Eastern situation. Will doing so be of any benefit to Britain?

Those who are keen on "two Chinas" should be awakened: there is only one China on Earth, and only one Chinese government, which is the People's Republic of China and its People's Government. If anyone wants to turn Taiwan, a part of China's territory, into another "China," then he is nothing more than an unrealistic dreamer out of touch with reality. He will embark on an irreparable path.

    不识时务的幻想家
    崔奇
    近来，有一些英国人似乎对台湾发生很大兴趣。他们到那里跑来跑去，对蒋介石集团做出各种各样的亲善姿态。1月间，英国“经济学人”杂志的前主编克罗齐访问了台湾。3月上旬，英国保守党议员蒂林到台湾进行活动。英国贸易部的官员也到台湾考察贸易问题。接着，又去了一个所谓“英国人士友好访问团”。美联社台北3月21日电讯报道：“现在到这个岛上来考察台湾情况的英国人的人数之多是空前的。”而且，这些人还只是打先锋的；据说，到了夏天，将有更“重要”的英国人士访问台湾。
    这么多的英国人络绎不绝地到台湾来，难道都是为了游山逛景吗？当然不是。他们有许多人是怀着某种政治动机的。据悉，克罗齐从台湾回国以后，就大肆鼓吹英国应该在事实上承认台湾，并同台湾建立事务性的联系。蒂林则更建议促进英国和台湾蒋介石集团间的“密切关系”。他在访问台湾期间，甚至公开谈论所谓“一般意义的战争”，并且慷慨地向蒋介石集团许愿说：“一旦发生战争，英国将同台湾一道作战（！）”
    我们不能说蒂林之流的这些言论是没有经过大脑的，也不能说他们的背后就没有别人的指使。蒂林之流的这些活动表明，对于制造“两个中国”一直感到兴趣的英国某些集团又在蠢蠢欲动了。这些人明明知道英国是承认了中华人民共和国的，但是他们却故意要同台湾蒋介石集团打交道，替蒋介石集团壮声势，以便在英国人民面前造成一种烟幕：似乎台湾也是一个“中国”。
    不消说，蒂林之流的这些活动是美国所欢迎的。近来美国正在想尽办法加强控制台湾，以便变台湾为美国的属地，阻挠中国人民和平解放自己的这块领土。恰恰在这个时候，英国统治集团中的一些人不辞辛劳到台湾来作“友好”访问。恰恰在这个时候，几年以来使英国许多商船大吃苦头的蒋介石集团，竟忽然受到一大群英国人的百般恭维。难道这是偶然的吗？非常明显，这些英国人并不见得就对蒋介石集团有那么多的友谊，他们不过是以此向美国表示谄媚而已。英国统治集团中有一些人惯于做这样一种外交交易：在远东问题上对美国作某些妥协，牺牲第三者的利益，来换取美国在其他地区对英国的让步。但是这个外交“公式”并不那么灵验，倒是往往弄巧成拙。最近举行的美英百慕大会谈的结果就是一个例证。
    蒂林这些人的活动如果不加以制止，只会损害中英两国的关系，并给远东局势带来不良因素。难道这样做会对英国有什么好处吗？
    应当让那些热中于“两个中国”的人们清醒一下：地球上只有一个中国，只有一个中国政府，那就是中华人民共和国和它的人民政府。如果谁想把中国的一部分领土台湾变为另一个“中国”，那么谁就不过是一个不识时务的幻想家而已。他将走上一条不可救药的绝路。
