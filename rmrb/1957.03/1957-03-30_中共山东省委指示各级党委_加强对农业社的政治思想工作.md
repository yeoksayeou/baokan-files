　　CCP Shandong Provincial Committee Directs Party Committees at All Levels
　　Strengthen Political and Ideological Work in Agricultural Cooperatives
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 29th. The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a directive on the 28th, requiring party committees at all levels in Shandong Province to effectively strengthen political and ideological work in agricultural cooperatives across the board in the first half of this year.
    The directive first affirmed the achievements made by party organizations at all levels in carrying out a series of political and ideological work during the high tide of agricultural cooperativization and the rectification of cooperatives last year. However, it also pointed out that in the period after cooperativization, various localities generally only paid attention to grasping the operation and management and production of agricultural cooperatives, and relaxed the regular and systematic political and ideological work of the party in agricultural cooperatives. Some rural party branches even failed to hold branch general meetings and group meetings for a long time, the party class system in many places was suspended, and propaganda networks and newspaper reading groups were also inactive. The directive criticized the erroneous idea of many cadres who thought that since cooperativization had been realized, ideological work was not so urgently needed.
    The directive believes that rural branches are the core of leading all rural activities, so it is necessary to improve the leadership of the branches and strengthen the education of all party members. In the coming year, education on the Party Constitution should be carried out among party members to raise their socialist consciousness, so that party members can work hard in production, modelly abide by the cooperative's constitution and labor discipline, care about the well-being of the masses, be selfless, and safeguard the collective interests of the state and the cooperative. The party branch's leadership over the cooperative is mainly political and ideological leadership. It should often correctly publicize to the members: the beautiful future of socialism must be realized through arduous efforts, and the cooperative system must also take several years to consolidate and fully发挥its superiority. It is necessary to strengthen the collective and patriotic education of the members, establish the idea of loving the cooperative as a home, and uniting and helping each other; continue to carry out the education of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily and managing the family diligently and thriftily, and mobilize the masses to come up with every possible means to carry out the agricultural production increase movement. At the same time, cadres should be educated to care about the lives of the masses and consult with the masses in everything.
    The directive finally pointed out that in order for grassroots party organizations to do a good job in the political work of agricultural cooperatives, rural party branches must establish a set of regular work systems to regularly check and study the implementation of the party's policies and guidelines.

　　中共山东省委指示各级党委
　　加强对农业社的政治思想工作
    新华社济南29日电  中共山东省委员会28日发出指示，要求山东省各级党委在今年上半年能够切实地把农业社的政治思想工作普遍加强起来。
    指示首先肯定了在去年农业合作化高潮和整社时期各级党组织进行一系列政治思想工作所取得的成绩。但同时指出，在合作化以后一段时期中，各地一般只注意抓农业社的经营管理和生产，放松了党在农业社中的经常的系统的政治思想工作。甚至有些农村党支部长期不开支部大会和小组会，不少地方党课制度停顿了，宣传网和读报组也不活动了。指示批判了许多干部以为合作化实现了，思想工作就不是那末迫切需要了的错误想法。
    指示认为，农村支部是领导农村一切活动的核心，因此必须健全支部的领导和加强对全体党员的教育。今后一年内，应围绕对党员进行党章教育，提高党员的社会主义觉悟，使党员做到努力生产，模范地遵守社章和劳动纪律，关心群众生活疾苦，大公无私，维护国家和社的集体利益。党支部对合作社的领导主要是政治思想领导。应该经常向社员正确地宣传：社会主义的美好前途必须经过艰苦的努力才能实现，合作社制度也必须经过几年才能巩固和充分发挥其优越性。要加强社员的集体主义和爱国主义教育，树立爱社如家、团结互助的思想；继续进行勤俭办社和勤俭理家的教育，动员群众想出千方百计来开展农业增产运动。同时，要教育干部关心群众生活，凡事和群众商量。
    指示最后指出，为使基层党组织能够做好农业社的政治工作，农村党支部必须建立起一套经常的工作制度，定期检查和研究党的政策方针的贯彻情况。
