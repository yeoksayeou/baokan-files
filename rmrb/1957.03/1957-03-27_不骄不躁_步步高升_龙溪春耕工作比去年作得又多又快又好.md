　　不骄不躁　步步高升
　　龙溪春耕工作比去年作得又多又快又好
    据新华社福州25日电　创造福建省粮食单位面积平均产量最高纪录的龙溪县，早稻插秧工作将提早在3月底全面开始。
    今年龙溪县粮食总产量计划比去年增加4％，每亩平均产量将由去年的一千一百七十九斤增加到一千二百二十五斤，连同发展水果、经济作物和副业生产等收入，全县农民平均收入将比去年增加9％左右。为了实现这个增产计划，各个农业社早在去年冬季就有步骤地进行今年增产准备工作。到3月19日止，全县溶田的面积已达到92.5％，有的还比往年多耙了一遍。已经完成和即将完成的水利工程共占全年水利修建计划的90％。上半年积肥计划已完成81.6％。南特号播种面积达到90％多。除了泥盐水选种和合式秧田的工作，由于放松领导，做得比去年差以外，其他各项春耕生产工作都做得比去年又多又快又好。
