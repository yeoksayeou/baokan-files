I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference, Premier Zhou Enlai's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of the Second Five-Year Plan, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the CPPCC Standing Committee.

I studied geology and am currently working in a research institute of the Ministry of Geology. Since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and the People's Government, China's geological work has developed rapidly. In a short period of several years, the number of geological cadres has increased to several thousand. The footprints of geological workers have spread all over remote border areas, discovering many mineral raw material bases, meeting the needs of the First Five-Year Plan for various mineral resources, and laying the foundation for the development of the Second Five-Year Plan. This is something that all our geological staff are pleased with and feel greatly honored by. I would like to express my humble opinions on the following three issues, and I ask the committee members for their corrections and relevant departments for their reference.

(1) On the Issue of Geological Research

Since liberation, under the conditions of a small number of personnel and heavy tasks, in order to meet the needs of the country, our work should focus on exploration, followed by gradually carrying out prospecting and regional geological surveys. This is a very natural and very reasonable step. Due to the full-scale exploration and prospecting, we have not paid enough attention to basic geological theories, and comprehensive research has also been done very little. Therefore, although a large amount of exploration and prospecting data has been accumulated, how to digest and use it has become a big problem, which has a great impact on the accurate evaluation of many mining areas. At the same time, due to the extensive development of exploration work, known mineral occurrences have gradually decreased. We cannot rely solely on the old method of finding mines based on existing mines, but must rely on theoretical guidance to discover hidden and extended new ore bodies. All of this requires scientific research to solve.

Based on the above reasons and in response to the government's call for a great march towards science, the Ministry of Geology launched scientific research work in the first half of 1956, which was very timely. However, at the beginning, we followed the Soviet model and established many specialized scientific research institutions. Whether this measure is correct is worthy of careful consideration.

The establishment of the research institutions of the Soviet Ministry of Geology has gone through a process from centralization to decentralization. At the beginning, they only had one geological research institute, and then, as the strength of some research offices grew and the tasks became heavier, they became independent institutes. This is a natural process of fruition. The recent Soviet geological delegation also emphasized this point to us. We have not properly considered this point when launching scientific research work, which has caused some difficulties. For example, the four research institutes have their own administrative institutions in the same building, causing a waste of manpower; the talents and equipment of each institute have their own strengths and weaknesses, but they cannot be fully utilized; there is also a feeling of tension in the construction of houses. Therefore, according to the principle of steady progress, how to appropriately concentrate and merge existing research institutions, so that all researchers can quickly and fully utilize existing equipment and carry out work without falling into chaos, is a key issue worthy of detailed study.

The cadre problem in scientific research work is also becoming increasingly serious. Since liberation, the teaching policy of several geological colleges has focused on training exploration specialists as the main focus and prospecting as the secondary focus. This can be understood in order to cooperate with the needs of the time. However, students trained in this way are often not suitable for research work. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously develop some comprehensive universities such as Peking University, Nanjing University, Northwest University, etc. to train talents suitable for research and solving complex problems in production. In addition, there are currently too many engineering courses in geological colleges. Students spend a lot of time learning to design certain parts of exploration equipment, but they learn less about basic courses such as minerals, rocks, ore deposits, paleontology, and geological structures. The foreign language training is also poor, and this situation needs to be corrected.

(2) Improvement of Prospecting and Exploration Methods

The greatest achievements of geological work in New China are the discovery of many new mines and the determination of the mineral reserves of several known producing areas. This must be accomplished by large-scale prospecting and exploration work. This brilliant achievement can only be achieved under the wise leadership of the Party and the government, and it is inseparable from the help of Soviet experts and the study of advanced Soviet experience. However, our work is not without shortcomings. For example, in some cases, due to the lack of economic perspective, too much work of trenching, pitting, drilling, and testing has been arranged, resulting in waste; sometimes, due to the lack of foresight and integrity in the exploration of ore deposits, the exploration design is one-sided, or the results of exploration cannot closely match the needs of the country.

Recently, comrades of the Chinese delegation, led by Antropov, Minister of Geology and Mineral Resources Protection of the Soviet Union, told us that the exploration specifications previously set by the Soviet Union inevitably required too much, which would cause many losses in time and economy. Therefore, a set of new specifications is currently being carefully drafted to serve as a guide for future prospecting and exploration work.

In order to further learn from the Soviet Union, we should re-examine and study the prospecting and exploration work done since liberation, draw on the experience and lessons learned, and, based on the specific geological conditions of China, refer to the new specifications set by the Soviet Union, improve the exploration methods, and formulate a set of our own specifications. This is an important measure that must be taken to improve work efficiency and accelerate the exploration of underground resources.

(3) Oil Issue

Since liberation, China's petroleum industry has achieved great development. Whether in exploration, drilling, refining, or storage and transportation, there have been new achievements. From 1950 to 1955, the total drilling footage in six years was 490,000 meters, while the total drilling footage in the forty-two years from 1907 to 1949 before liberation was only 39,710 meters. The annual output of natural petroleum in 1955 increased nearly five times compared with the highest annual output before liberation. In the past year, good news of oil gushing from new oil areas such as Karamay, Lenghu (Qaidam), Yaerxia, ​​Malianquan (all near Laojunmiao, Yumen, Gansu), and Dushanzi has continued to come, greatly increasing our confidence in China's oil prospects and powerfully shattering the malicious propaganda that China has no oil.

The news of oil gushing from Yaerxia and Malianquan is of particularly important significance because it is located in a place where the railway has already been connected, and the transportation is convenient, and the future development will naturally be twice the result with half the effort. From the perspective of the new oil field, the so-called "Second Laojunmiao" that we have been trying to find for many years may have been found in this area.

In order to find more "Laojunmiao," I suggest that prospecting and exploration work be carried out in the basins formed by Tertiary strata west of Laojunmiao and south of Anxi and Dunhuang. If oil fields are discovered in these areas, then we will have more reason to build a branch line from the Gansu-Xinjiang Railway trunk line to Anxi and Dunhuang south through the Dangjin Pass to the northern edge of the Qaidam Basin. This will connect the most important oil areas in Gansu and Qinghai provinces, and it will also be possible to rapidly develop the Lenghu oil field, which has been proven to have industrial value on the northern edge of the basin.

Finally, I make a guarantee that I will continue to study hard and constantly transform myself, and that I will contribute all my due strength in the glorious task of marching towards science and finding mineral raw material bases for the motherland. (Attached picture)

    地质工作要跟国家要求密切结合
    谢家荣的发言
    我完全同意并衷心拥护毛主席在最高国务会议中的讲话，周恩来总理访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告，李富春副总理关于第二个五年计划的说明及陈叔通副主席关于政协常委会的工作报告。
    我是学地质的，目前正在地质部的一个研究所中工作。解放以来在党及人民政府的正确领导下，中国的地质事业突飞猛晋，在短短数年中地质干部增加到数千人，地质工作者的足迹，遍及边疆僻壤，发现了许多矿物原料基地，满足了第一个五年计划所需要的各种矿产资源，并为第二个五年计划的发展，奠立了基础；这是我们全体地质工作人员所引为欣慰并感到莫大光荣的。现就下列三个问题略抒己见，请各位委员们指正并请有关部门参考。
  （1）关于地质研究的问题
    解放以来，在人员少，任务重的条件下，为满足国家需要，我们的工作自应以勘探为重点，其次则逐渐开展普查找矿及区域地质测量，这是非常自然也是十分合理的步骤。由于全力进行勘探和普查，我们对于基本地质理论就不够注意，综合研究，也做得很少，因此尽管积累了大量的勘探和普查资料，而如何消化运用，却大成问题，这对于许多矿区的准确评价，有莫大的影响。同时，由于勘探工作的广泛展开，已知矿点就逐渐减少了，我们不可能只凭着就矿找矿的老办法，而必须根据理论指导以发现潜伏的和延展的新矿体，这一切都需要科学研究来予以解决。
    根据上述理由并响应政府向科学大进军的号召，地质部于1956年上半年就开展科学研究工作，这是非常适时的。但我们一开始就仿照苏联办法建立了许多专门的科学研究机构，这种措施是否对，值得慎重考虑。
    苏联地质部的研究机构是经过由集中到分散的过程建立起来的。在开始时他们只有一个地质研究所，然后随着某些研究室力量的壮大，以及任务的繁重而将它们独立成所。这是个瓜熟蒂落的自然过程。最近苏联地质代表团来时也向我们着重提醒过这一点。我们在展开科学研究工作时未适当的考虑这一点已造成了一些困难，例如四个研究所在同一建筑物内都各有其行政机构，造成了一些人力的浪费；各所的人才和设备互有短长，而不能充分加以利用；在房屋建筑上也感到紧张。因此，根据稳步前进的原则，如何将现有研究机构适当地集中合并，使所有研究人员都能迅速充分的利用现有设备，进行工作，不致陷于忙乱，是一个值得详细研究的关键性问题。
    在科学研究工作中的干部问题也日渐严重。解放以来几个地质学院的教学方针是以培养勘探的专业为主普查为副，这为配合当时的需要是可以理解的。但这样培养出来的学生往往不适合于研究工作，因此就需要大力发展一些综合性的大学如北京大学，南京大学，西北大学等的地质系，以便造就适合于研究及解决生产中复杂问题的人才。另外目前地质学院的工程课太多，学生花了许多时间去学习设计勘探用具上某些零件，而对基本课程如矿物、岩石、矿床、古生物地质构造等，反而学得较少，外文训练也差，这种情况需要改正。
    （2）普查与勘探方法
    的改进
    新中国地质工作的最大成就是许多新矿地的发现和若干已知产地的矿量的确定，这都要靠大规模的普查和勘探工作来完成。这种辉煌的成就，只有在党和政府的英明领导下才能获得，并且是与苏联专家的帮助及学习苏联先进经验分不开的。但我们的工作还不是没有缺点的，如在有些场合，因为缺乏经济观点，遂过多地布置了槽探，坑探，钻探及化验工作量，而造成了浪费；有时则因对矿床的勘探缺乏预见性和整体性遂使勘探设计陷于片面，或使勘探的结果不能与国家的要求密切配合。
    最近以苏联地质和矿藏保护部部长安特罗波夫为首的访华团同志们告诉我们说：苏联以往所定的勘探规范，不免要求过高，在时间和经济上要造成许多损失，因此，目前正在缜密拟订一套新的规范来作为今后普查勘探工作的指南。
    为了更进一步的学习苏联，我们应当重新检查和研究解放以来所做的各项普查勘探工作，吸取其中的经验教训，在结合中国具体地质情况基础上，参考苏联所定的新规范，对勘探方法进行改进，而制定一套我们自己的规范，这是为提高工作效能，加速勘探地下富源所必需采取的一项重要措施。
    （3）石油问题
    解放以来中国石油工业获得了巨大的发展，无论在勘探、钻井、制炼、储运各方面俱有新的成就。从1950——1955年六年中的钻探总进尺为四十九万公尺，而解放前1907——1949年四十二年中钻探总进尺则仅为三万九千七百一十公尺，1955年天然石油的年产量与解放前最高年产量相比增加几达五倍。最近一年中新油区如克拉玛依，冷湖（柴达木）鸭儿峡，马莲泉（俱在甘肃玉门老君庙附近）及独山子等地的喷油好消息不断传来，大大地增加了我们对中国石油远景的信心，有力地粉碎了以往认为中国无石油的恶意宣传。
    鸭儿峡和马莲泉喷油的消息是具有特别重要的意义的，因为它是位于铁路已经通到的地方，交通便利，将来发展自属事半功倍。从新油田的观点讲，我们多少年来努力寻找的所谓“第二老君庙”可能已在这个地区中找到了。
    为了寻找更多的“老君庙”我建议要在老君庙以西，在安西和敦煌以南几个由第三纪地层所成的盆地中进行普查勘探工作，如果在这些地区中发现了油田，那么我们就更有理由去修建从甘新铁路干线上安西敦煌往南通过当金山口直达柴达木盆地北缘的一条支线，这样就可把甘青两省最重要的油区连系起来，并且也就可以把处在盆地北缘业已证明有工业价值的冷湖油田迅速地开发起来了。
    最后我提出保证，要继续努力学习，并不断改造自己，要在向科学大进军及在为祖国寻找矿物原料基地的光荣任务中，贡献出我自己应尽的全部力量。（附图片）
