　　The fishing boats sail far, far away from the harbor
　　The turbid seawater has turned emerald green and transparent
　　The captain raises the red flag in the air
　　Waving, the fleet arranges itself into a huge encirclement
　　The battle on the fishing grounds has already begun
　　The drums of war rumble on the waves
　　Those who row and those who beat the "?" are covered in sweat [Note]
　　The drumbeats are like a sudden downpour on the sea
　　Our fishing experts have already cast their nets
　　Schools of large yellow croaker thrash about in the nets
　　"Guess, how many dan can we get in this haul?"
　　The young men cheer towards the sea
　　The decks are covered with shimmering fish scales
　　The yellow croakers are so crowded in the hold they are squeaking…

　　[Note] "敲?" is a fishing method that requires at least dozens of fishing boats to be arranged in a circle, under unified command. Each boat has a thick wooden board, and mallets are used to strike the boards, vibrating the seawater, driving the fish to concentrate in one place, and then encircling them with nets.

    战鼓隆隆地响
    周望望
    渔船驶出港口很远很远
    浑浊的海水已变成碧绿透明
    大队长举起红旗在空中
    挥动船队排列成巨大的包围圈
    渔场上的战斗已经开始了
    战鼓在浪头上隆隆地响起
    划桨的敲?的都汗流满面〔注〕
    鼓点就像骤雨倾注在海上
    我们的捕鱼能手已把渔网撒下
    成群的大黄鱼在网兜里乱窜
    “你猜吧，这一网能有几百担”
    小伙子们向着大海在欢呼
    甲板上都贴满着闪烁的鱼鳞
    黄鱼在船舱里挤得叫咕咕……
      〔注〕敲?是一种捕鱼作业法，至少要数十只渔船排列成圆圈，统一指挥。每只船上置一块厚木板，用槌子敲击木板，振动海水，驱使鱼群集中到一个地方，再用网围捕。
