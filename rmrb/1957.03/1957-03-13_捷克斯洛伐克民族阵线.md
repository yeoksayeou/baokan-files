    The Czechoslovak National Front

    The Czechoslovak National Front is a united front organization of the working people in both urban and rural areas of Czechoslovakia. Its members include the Czechoslovak Communist Party and four democratic parties: the Czechoslovak Socialist Party, the Czechoslovak People's Party, the Slovak Freedom Party, and the Slovak Revival Party. In addition, the following are also members of the National Front: the Czechoslovak Trade Union, the Czechoslovak Youth League, the Czechoslovak-Soviet Friendship Association, the Central Council of Czechoslovak Cooperatives, and six other social organizations. The permanent body of the National Front is the Presidium of the Central Committee. The Chairman of the Presidium is Comrade Široký, the Prime Minister of the Czechoslovak Republic.

    The Czechoslovak Communist Party is the leading and guiding force of the Czechoslovak National Front. The Party unites the people of Czechoslovakia through the National Front's organization, mobilizing their strength to build socialism. The main tasks of the National Front are: under the leadership of the Communist Party, to promote the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance, to establish and strengthen the spiritual and political unity of the entire nation, to regularly carry out mass political education work, so that the people of the whole country can contribute to the socialist construction of Czechoslovakia.

    The Czechoslovak National Front was born during the anti-fascist war. In order to drive out the Nazi occupiers and fight for the independence and freedom of the motherland, the Czechoslovak Communist Party united workers, peasants, small business owners, working intellectuals, and a portion of patriotic bourgeois elements around itself, establishing the organization of the National Front. In the final stage of the anti-fascist war, in April 1945, the joint government of the National Front was established in Košice, an eastern border city liberated by the Soviet army. The members participating in the government decided to take the program of national and democratic revolution put forward by the Czechoslovak Communist Party as the program of the new government. This is the famous Košice Program in Czechoslovak history.

    After the war, some bourgeois parties participating in the Czechoslovak government, under the instigation of imperialism, launched a coup d'état, attempting to restore the capitalist system. Under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and with the unanimous unity of the people of the whole country, the conspiracy of the reactionaries was finally crushed, and the people's democratic system was firmly established.

    The role of the National Front in Czechoslovakia has become increasingly prominent. The 10th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party held in June 1954 once again affirmed the correctness of the National Front policy. The resolution of the congress pointed out: "Only by continuously consolidating the broad unity of our people united in the National Front under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, can we solve the various tasks related to the socialist construction of our country." During the election of the Czechoslovak National Assembly in November 1954, the political parties and organizations of the National Front jointly proposed a list of candidates. As a result of the election, about 98% of the voters who participated in the election voted for the candidates of the National Front.

    The leaders of the democratic parties participating in the Czechoslovak National Front are currently holding certain responsible positions in the central and local governments of Czechoslovakia. For example, the Chairman of the Czechoslovak Socialist Party, E. Šlechta, serves as the Chairman of the State Construction Committee of the government; the Chairman of the Czechoslovak People's Party, J. Plojhar, serves as the Minister of Health of the government; the Chairman of the Slovak Revival Party, J. Kyselý, serves as the Minister of Local Economy; and V. Pokojný, a leader of the Slovak Freedom Party, is working locally in Slovakia. The former three are visiting our country this time as members of the Czechoslovak government delegation.

    捷克斯洛伐克民族阵线
    捷克斯洛伐克民族阵线是捷克斯洛伐克城乡劳动人民的统一战线组织。它的成员包括捷克斯洛伐克共产党和四个民主党派——捷克斯洛伐克社会党、捷克斯洛伐克人民党、斯洛伐克自由党、斯洛伐克复兴党。此外，作为民族阵线成员的还有：捷克斯洛伐克工会、捷克斯洛伐克青年联盟、捷苏友好协会、捷克斯洛伐克合作社中央理事会和其他六个社会团体。民族阵线的常设机构是中央委员会主席团。主席团主席是捷克斯洛伐克共和国总理西罗基同志。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党是捷克斯洛伐克民族阵线的领导和指导力量。党通过民族阵线的组织来团结捷克斯洛伐克全国人民，动员他们的力量建设社会主义。民族阵线的主要任务是：在共产党的领导下促进工农联盟的巩固，建立和加强全国人民精神上和政治上的一致，经常进行群众性的政治教育工作，使全国人民为捷克斯洛伐克的社会主义建设事业作出贡献。
    捷克斯洛伐克民族阵线是在反法西斯战争期间诞生的。为了驱逐纳粹占领者和争取祖国的独立自由，捷克斯洛伐克共产党把工人、农民、小企业主、劳动知识分子和一部分爱国的资产阶级分子团结在自己的周围，建立了民族阵线的组织。在反法西斯战争的最后阶段，1945年4月在苏军解放的东部边境城市科息斯成立了民族阵线的联合政府。参加政府的成员决定以捷克斯洛伐克共产党提出的民族与民主革命的纲领为新政府的纲领。这也就是捷克斯洛伐克历史上有名的科息斯纲领。
    战后，参加捷克斯洛伐克政府的一些资产阶级政党曾在帝国主义的策动之下发动了政变，企图复僻资本主义制度。在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下和全国人民的一致团结下，终于粉碎了反动派的阴谋，巩固地确立了人民民主制度。
    民族阵线在捷克斯洛伐克的作用日益显著，1954年6月举行的捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会再一次肯定了民族阵线政策的正确性。代表大会的决议中指出：“只有在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下不断巩固团结在民族阵线内的我国人民的广泛团结，我们才能解决与我国社会主义建设有关的各种任务。”1954年11月捷克斯洛伐克国民议会选举时，民族阵线各政党团体曾联合提出候选人的名单，选举结果，参加选举的约98％的选民是投票选举民族阵线候选人的。
    参加捷克斯洛伐克民族阵线的各民主党派的领导人今天都在捷克斯洛伐克中央和地方政府中担任一定的负责工作。如捷克斯洛伐克社会党主席埃·斯列赫达任政府国家建设委员会主席，捷克斯洛伐克人民党主席约·普洛伊哈任政府卫生部长，斯洛伐克复兴党主席约·基塞利任地方经济部长，斯洛伐克自由党领导人文·波科伊尼在斯洛伐克担任地方工作。前三人这次作为捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团团员来我国访问。
