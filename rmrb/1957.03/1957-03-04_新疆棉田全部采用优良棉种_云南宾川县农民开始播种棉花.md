Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi. Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region plans to plant 2.1 million mu of cotton this year. Except for a very small portion in remote areas, all will use superior Soviet cotton seeds. Currently, various cotton-growing areas are transferring the improved seeds. The Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region has also recently allocated hundreds of thousands of jin of improved seeds to support farmers in planting.

The autonomous region's cotton fields this year will expand by 260,000 mu compared to last year. The unit area yield is expected to reach 64 jin of ginned cotton, and the total output is expected to increase by 26 million jin compared to last year. Last year, the region planted more than 1.4 million mu of cotton (excluding the Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region), of which the planting area of ​​Soviet improved varieties accounted for 88%.

This newspaper reports: Farmers in Binchuan County, Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, have begun sowing cotton.

Binchuan is an important cotton-producing area in Yunnan. Last year, the county's more than 60,000 mu of cotton yielded an average of more than 59 jin of ginned cotton per mu. This year, they aim to increase the county's average yield per mu to 70 jin of ginned cotton. All agricultural cooperatives have made earlier spring plowing preparations this year than last year, and it is estimated that all winter fallow fields, mountain land, and vegetable gardens will be planted in the near future.
