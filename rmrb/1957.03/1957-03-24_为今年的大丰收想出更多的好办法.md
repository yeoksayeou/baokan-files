Think of more good ways to achieve a great harvest this year

"Think of every possible way to strive for a great agricultural harvest in 1957!" - This is the call issued by the Party Central Committee to all farmers and rural workers throughout the country. On February 26th, the National Conference of Representatives of Agricultural Labor Models made a resolution with this as its title. On March 19th, the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on doing a good job in spring plowing and striving for a great agricultural harvest in 1957 pointed out that it should become the central slogan and goal of struggle on the agricultural production front.

The instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have clearly pointed out the ways and favorable conditions for striving for a great harvest this year, as well as some specific issues in the preparatory work. What should be paid attention to at present is to think of every possible way to better utilize the existing favorable conditions, and to think of every possible way to create more conditions. We know that in addition to the favorable conditions, some agricultural cooperatives also have some difficulties due to various reasons, such as the lack of fertilizer and funds, the shortage and weakness of draught animals, and so on. However, it is up to people to make things happen. In the face of the Communist Party and the organized working people, there are no insurmountable difficulties. To build socialism and continuously increase agricultural output, it would be strange if we did not encounter some difficulties. In the face of revolutionaries, there are always difficulties, and there are always solutions.

In mid-December last year, Hunan Province had only accumulated 900 million dan of fertilizer. Some people believed that the sources of fertilizer had been exhausted last year, and no more fertilizer could be accumulated; some people doubted the effectiveness of fertilizer accumulated last year and were unwilling to accumulate more fertilizer. Can this problem be solved? Facts have proved that it can be solved. Various localities have calculated detailed accounts for the masses about the serious impact that the lack of fertilizer might have on increasing production, and have formulated reasonable labor quotas for accumulating fertilizer and the price for purchasing household fertilizer; therefore, they have mobilized the masses and found a large amount of fertilizer sources. By the beginning of March, the amount of fertilizer accumulated in the province had risen to more than 2.68 billion dan. This amount still cannot meet the needs of increasing production; farmers and cadres in most parts of Hunan are confidently accumulating more fertilizer.

The difficulty of insufficient production funds can also be solved. According to a survey and statistics of 177 cooperatives in seven counties of Jingzhou Prefecture, Hubei Province, the original shortage of production funds was more than 580,000 yuan; after thinking of ways and doing a lot of work, relying on the strength of each agricultural cooperative itself, more than 520,000 yuan was raised; plus a part of government loans, the problem of lack of funds was completely solved. What methods did they use? One method is to calculate detailed accounts for the members about the possible reduction in production and the reduction in income of the members due to the lack of funds, and to mobilize the members to invest voluntarily. After the Mingxing Cooperative in Zhongxiang County did this, more than 200 households in the cooperative invested more than 6,000 yuan, which was more than half of the original shortage of funds in the cooperative. Another method is to expand sideline production and increase cash income without hindering spring plowing production. The cooperatives in Xiangxi Township, Zhongxiang County, did this and earned more than 150,000 yuan in one month, which, in addition to solving the problem of production funds, also had a surplus of more than 70,000 yuan to be distributed to the members. Cleaning up the materials accumulated in the cooperative also increased a part of the funds. Careful calculation also saved a part of the funds. In addition, there are many other effective methods that agricultural cooperatives in various places have already come up with.

What to do if there are insufficient draught animals? Many regions have also come up with many methods: Some agricultural cooperatives in Henan Province have classified the existing draught animals, and uniformly arranged them according to the size and strength of the draught animals, and reasonably stipulated different work quotas for using different draught animals, changing the practice of competing for strong livestock and not wanting weak livestock. At the agricultural activist representative meeting held in Shandong Province not long ago, some representatives put forward some methods to solve the problem of insufficient draught animals: 33 livestock in Jianguo Cooperative in Laiwu County were so weak that they could not work. After improving feeding management, there was a great change in more than half a month, and they could be enough for spring plowing; Xinrong Cooperative and other cooperatives in Yishui County voluntarily proposed to extract certain livestock power to help brother cooperatives complete spring plowing and spring planting, and help each other under the principle of voluntary mutual benefit. Sichuan Province will adjust more than 109,000 heads of cattle within the province according to the natural circulation route of cattle, and can also transfer a part to support other regions. Many places have also adopted the method of "using livestock to transport manure to distant places, and using manpower to transport manure to nearby places", and using water power, wind power, and manpower to irrigate fields and push mills to save livestock power.

In terms of farmland water conservancy, the potential is still very large. Some places have only improved the organizational form of labor for building water conservancy projects and the calculation method of labor remuneration, which has greatly accelerated the progress of the project. Some places have created many methods to make water conservancy reach high mountains and cross deep ditches, so that many lands that could not be irrigated in the past can no longer suffer from drought; only by leveling the land before irrigation can a lot of water be saved and many lands be irrigated. Some places have compared and studied various water lifting tools originally used by farmers, and created water lifting tools with greater efficiency and less effort.

Agricultural cooperatives in various places can also appropriately expand some cultivated land area according to the possible conditions in their locality, and closely combine the expansion of cultivated land area with the preservation of water and soil. According to a survey in Tang County, Hebei Province, there are 100,000 terraced fields in the county that have been destroyed by floods. Rebuilding them can increase the cultivated land by tens of thousands of mu. Last year, Jimingsi District in Zunhua County carried out the "no idle land campaign", and reclaimed and sorted out more than 2,800 mu of barren mountains and wasteland without hindering water and soil conservation (the Jianming Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative led by Wang Guofan alone reclaimed more than 900 mu of wasteland); tens of thousands of catties of grain and many vegetables were harvested. This year they will continue to do so. There are plenty of scattered lands that can be used by the village, river, lake, and tomb sides. The existing low-yield cultivated land and land that could not be cultivated in the past can also be changed in terrain and improved in soil. According to specific conditions, striving to expand multiple cropping and intercropping is an effective method that has been practiced in many places.

There is still a very broad range of areas in terms of production and operation, labor organization, cultivation technology, etc., that need to be improved and can be improved, and there are a variety of methods that can be adopted.

Old farmers have many old methods of increasing production, agricultural scientific and technical personnel have many new methods of increasing production, and other places and other agricultural cooperatives have many effective methods of increasing production, which need to be carefully studied and tested. The methods of increasing production that have been proven effective in the local cooperative after testing can be appropriately - but must not be blindly - promoted.

From the leadership's point of view, how to mobilize all positive factors, how to rationally arrange various tasks, how to seize the key to increasing production in the local area, how to strengthen the weak links in the work, how to discover new problems and solve them in time, how to discover good experiences and promote them universally, etc., must rely on the common wisdom of the masses, strive to come up with good methods, and can also learn from the existing good methods of others.

### 为今年的大丰收想出更多的好办法

    为今年的大丰收想出更多的好办法
    “想尽一切办法，争取1957年的农业大丰收！”——这是党中央对全国农民和农村工作人员发出的号召。2月26日，全国农业劳动模范代表会议以它为题目作出了决议。3月19日，中共中央和国务院关于做好春耕工作、争取1957年农业大丰收的指示中，又指出它应当成为农业生产战线上的中心口号和奋斗目标。
    关于争取今年大丰收的途径和有利条件，准备工作中的一些具体问题，在中共中央和国务院的指示里面，已经清楚地指出。目前应该注意的是想尽一切办法更好地运用已有的有利条件，想尽一切办法更多地创造一些条件。我们知道，除了有利的条件以外，有些农业社因为各种缘故，还存在着一些困难，例如，肥料和资金的缺乏，耕畜的不足和瘦弱，等等。可是，事在人为。在共产党和组织起来的劳动人民面前，是没有不可克服的困难的。要建设社会主义，要不断地提高农业产量，如果碰不到一些困难，那倒是奇怪的事情。在革命者面前，困难总是有的，办法也总是有的。
    湖南省去年12月中旬积肥数量只有九亿担。有些人认为肥源去年已经挖尽，再也无肥可积了；有些人怀疑去年积肥的肥效，不愿意再多积肥了。这个问题究竟能不能解决？事实证明，能够解决。各地向群众算了缺肥对增产可能发生的严重影响的细账，并且制定了合理的积肥劳动定额和收买家肥的价格；因而发动了群众，找出了大量的肥源。到3月初，全省积肥数量已经上升到了二十六亿八千多担。这个数量仍然不能满足增产的需要；湖南大部地区的农民和干部正在有信心地积更多的肥料。
    生产资金不足的困难也有办法解决。据湖北荆州专区七个县一百七十七个社的调查统计，原来缺生产资金五十八万多元；想了办法、做了许多工作以后，依靠各个农业社本身的力量，就筹集起来五十二万多元；再加上一部分政府贷款，缺乏资金的问题就完全解决了。他们采用了一些什么办法呢？一个办法是向社员算因为缺乏资金而可能使社里缩减生产、使社员减少收入的细账，发动社员自愿投资。锺祥县明星社这样做了以后，全社二百多户投资六千多元，比社里原缺资金还多出一半。又一个办法是在不妨碍春耕生产的条件下扩大副业生产，增加现金收入。锺祥县襄西乡各社这样做了，一个月就收入十五万多元，除解决了生产资金问题以外，还多余七万多元可以分给社员。清理社里积存物资，也增加了一部分资金。精打细算，又节省了一部分资金。此外各地农业社已经想出来的有效办法还有很多。
    耕畜不足怎么办？许多地区也已经想出了不少办法：河南省有些农业社把现有耕畜分了类，根据耕畜的大小强弱统一安排，合理规定使用不同耕畜的不同的工作定额，改变争用强牲口、不要弱牲口的做法。在山东省不久以前举行的农业积极分子代表会议上，一些代表提出了一些解决耕畜不足问题的办法：莱芜县建国社有三十三头牲口瘦弱得不得干活，改进了饲养管理，半月多工夫就有很大的转变，春耕时可以够用；沂水县新星社等社自动提出抽出一定畜力帮助兄弟社完成春耕春种，在自愿互利的原则下互相帮助。四川省将按照耕牛的自然流转路线，在省内调剂耕牛十万九千多头，还可外调一部分支援别的地区。许多地方还采取了“用牲畜往远地送粪，用人力往近地送粪”，利用水力、风力、人力灌田推碾磨等办法节省畜力。
    在农田水利方面，潜力也还大得很。有些地方只是改进了兴修水利的劳动组织形式和劳动报酬计算方法，就大大加快了工程的进度。有些地方创造了许多办法，使水利上到了高山、跨过了深沟，使许多过去浇不到的地，可以不再受旱；只是把土地在灌溉之前先平整一下，就节约了许多水，多浇了许多地。有些地方把农民中间原有的各式各样的提水工具加以比较研究，创造出来了效率更大、更省力的提水工具。
    各地农业社还可以根据本地的可能条件，适当地扩大一些耕地面积，并把耕地面积的扩大和水土的保持密切地结合起来。据河北唐县调查，全县被冲毁的梯田有十万道，重新修好可以增加耕地数万亩。遵化县鸡鸣寺区去年开展了“无闲地运动”，在不妨碍水土保持的条件下开垦、整理出荒山废地二千八百多亩（只是王国藩领导的建明农林牧生产合作社就开垦出荒地九百多亩）；多收了几十万斤粮食和许多蔬菜。今年他们还要继续这样做。村边、河边、湖边、坟边，可以利用的零星土地有的是。现有的低产耕地和过去不能种的地，也可以改变地形，改良土壤。按照具体条件力求扩大复种和间作，更是许多地方已经行之有效的办法。
    生产经营、劳动组织、耕作技术等等方面，需要改进、可以改进的地方都还非常广阔，有多种多样的办法可以采取。
    老农有许多增产的老办法，农业科学技术人员有许多增产的新办法，别的地方、别的农业社有许多行之有效的增产办法，都需要认真地学习、试验，在本地本社经过试验确实有效的增产办法，可以适当地——但必须不是盲目地——推广。
    从领导方面来说，怎样调动一切积极因素，怎样合理安排各项工作，怎样抓住当地的增产关键，怎样加强工作的薄弱环节，怎样发现新问题及时解决，怎样发现好经验普遍推广，等等，都必须依靠群众的共同智慧，努力想出好办法来，也都可以向别人学习已有的好办法。
