Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 22nd: More than 2,800 primary school graduates in Wuhan who did not continue their studies last year are making rapid progress after participating in self-study groups. Already, 400 have been评为 (píng wèi) rated as "three good" self-study students and self-study activists, more than 30 have joined the Communist Youth League during their self-study, and one has joined the Communist Party.

These primary school graduates who did not continue their studies began in September of last year, under the leadership of the Wuhan Municipal Middle School and Primary School Graduate Self-Study Guidance Committee, organized into ninety-four self-study groups by street, and studied in forty-eight tutorial classes. The courses of study are Chinese language, arithmetic, and basic political knowledge, and exams are held regularly.

The Self-Study Guidance Committee and education departments compiled unified teaching materials based on the specific situation of primary school graduates in the Wuhan area, and transferred more than twenty teachers to serve as tutors in various districts. In each self-study group, there are life counselors who organize and guide them in centralized self-study and various cultural, sports, and social activities. People from all walks of life in society also care about these primary school graduates. Many parents actively contacted teachers and counselors, and urged their children to study and review. Many streets, organizations, and groups voluntarily gave up houses and lent furniture to self-study groups.

Initially, some students worried that they would not learn anything in the self-study groups and held a skeptical wait-and-see attitude. After patient education from counselors and teachers, they saw that they could indeed learn something with the help of the collective and the guidance of the teachers, and gradually dispelled their doubts. Yin Yuzhen, a primary school graduate from Jijia Street in Hanyang, initially did not believe in the self-study group and took the self-study textbook home to study on her own, but later saw that there was a lot of new content in the textbook that she had not learned, and she could not understand it, so she had to ask to return to the self-study group to study. Now she has not only consolidated the fraction addition and subtraction she learned in the past, but also learned fraction four operations, and can also smoothly calculate more complex fraction application problems.

The students who are conducting self-study also actively participated in various cultural and sports activities and social public welfare activities, and have received praise from district leaders and the masses. All sixty-two students in the Da Dongjia Street self-study group participated in literacy work, and fifteen of them were rated as literacy activists.

　  武汉两千多未升学的高小毕业生
　　参加自学小组进步很快
    新华社武汉22日电　武汉市两千八百多名去年未升学的高小毕业生，在参加自学小组学习以后进步很快。已经有四百人被评为“三好”自学学生和自学积极分子，三十多人在自学期间参加了青年团，一人参加了共产党。
    这些未升学的高小毕业生从去年9月份开始，在武汉市中学和高小毕业生自学指导委员会领导下，按街道组织了九十四个自学小组，分别在四十八个辅导班进行学习。学习的课程是语文、算术和政治常识，并且定期举行考试。
    自学指导委员会和教育部门根据武汉地区高小毕业生的具体情况编印了统一的教材，抽调了二十多名教师分别在各区担任辅导课。在每个自学小组里，都设有生活辅导员，组织指导他们集中自学和进行各种文化体育活动和社会活动。社会各方面的人士对这些高小毕业生也很关怀。许多家长主动地同教师、辅导员取得联系，并且督促子弟自学和进行复习。许多街道、机关团体都主动的让出房子，借家具给自学小组。
    开始时，有一些学生耽心自己在自学小组学不到东西，抱着怀疑观望的态度。经过辅导员和教师们的耐心教育后，他们看到在集体的帮助和辅导老师教导下的确能学到东西，才渐渐地消除了疑虑。汉阳集家街的高小毕业生尹玉珍开始不相信自学小组，将自学课本带回家里自己学，可是后来看看课本上有不少自己没学过的新内容，看也看不懂，只好再要求回到自学小组学习。现在她不仅巩固了过去学的分数加减法，学会了分数四则，并且也能顺利地演算较复杂的分数应用题了。
    进行自学的学生们还积极地参加了各种文化体育活动和社会公益活动，得到了区领导的表扬和群众的好评。大董家街自学小组的六十二个学生全部参加了扫盲工作，其中有十五人被评为扫盲积极分子。
