After listening to Chairman Mao's analysis and instructions on contradictions among the people and Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation on several issues of the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan before the opening of this conference; and after listening to Premier Zhou's report on his visits to eleven Asian and European countries and Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech on market conditions and increasing production and practicing economy after the opening of the conference, I personally gained great inspiration and a lot of knowledge, and my confidence in China's socialist construction has increased immensely. This fully demonstrates the importance of this conference. Now I would like to offer some opinions on current educational issues:

The Number of Students at All Levels of Schools Has Increased Many Times, and a Serious Contradiction Has Formed Between Quantity and Quality

Since liberation, China's education has greatly developed and achieved tremendous results. Comparing 1949 with 1956, the number of students in Chinese universities and colleges increased from 116,000 to 380,000, the number of students in secondary schools increased from 1,268,000 to 5,860,000, and the number of primary school students increased from 24,390,000 to more than 57,700,000. These figures show that schools at all levels have developed three to five times, which was unimaginable before liberation. Last year, in the second half of the year, I inspected Guangdong and learned about the educational situation. Taking Guangdong Province as an example, the number of primary school students in 1956 increased by more than 600,000 compared with 1955, an increase of 147% compared with 1949. The number of junior high school students increased by more than 80,000, an increase of 170% compared with 1949. The number of senior high school students increased by more than 20,000, an increase of 442% compared with 1949. This also shows that the education cause has made even more rapid progress last year.

Due to the large increase in the number of schools and students, there are also many difficulties. Therefore, there are also many problems in education currently. The most serious is the contradiction between needs and possibilities, and the contradiction between quantity and quality. In addition, we have found that the burden on teachers and students is still very heavy. Because of the heavy burden, the improvement of teaching quality is affected. Generally speaking, the health of teachers and students is not very good. Due to the expansion of enrollment quotas in schools, the standards for student admission have been lowered. Due to the shortage of teachers, the method of upgrading teachers level by level has been adopted, and the quality of teachers has also been reduced. Coupled with the fact that school buildings and teaching equipment cannot meet the requirements of teaching, the teaching work is inevitably rough.

In order to improve teaching quality and reduce the excessive burden on teachers and students, we must first consider various specific conditions related to teaching, the teaching ability of teachers, and the learning ability of students. Only seeing the needs without paying attention to the possibilities, and blindly pursuing quantity is not worth the loss. Therefore, improving teaching quality is the basic issue in education today. How can we achieve this? First of all, we must have the necessary teaching conditions, that is, universities must have the conditions for university teaching, middle schools must have the conditions for middle school teaching, and primary schools must have the conditions for primary school teaching. What are these conditions? The most important thing is qualified teachers at all levels of schools. At present, in many universities, teaching in the lower grades is mostly done by teaching assistants or lecturers, which cannot be regarded as meeting the conditions in this regard, or it can be said that it does not meet the specifications. It cannot be regarded as meeting the specifications for middle school teaching to be done by teachers promoted from primary schools. Of course, there are also qualified teaching assistants who can teach a certain subject in the first year of university, and excellent primary school teachers who are promoted to junior high school can be competent for teaching individual subjects, but these are very individual cases. We hope that when university students first enter university, they can receive the teachings of professors or associate professors, which not only gives students a solid foundation in knowledge, but also has a very important influence on students' personality cultivation. Therefore, schools that do not have the qualifications of teachers would rather not enroll more students. Of course, this conflicts with the needs of the country, but education cannot be obtained cheaply. We have heard at many education symposiums that many university graduates still have to make up basic courses when they arrive at their jobs. Isn't this a waste? In addition to qualified teachers, there must also be the necessary material environment and teaching equipment. In this regard, many schools are also very lacking. We have seen that many schools do not have enough books and instruments, classrooms and dormitories are too crowded, there are no extracurricular activity places, and living conditions are very poor. The state cannot pay enough education funds during large-scale economic construction, and the material conditions of schools cannot be met quickly. Although in this regard, it can be maintained by running schools diligently and thriftily and calculating carefully, the minimum material equipment is still essential.

Replenish Teachers, Strengthen Teaching Force, and Give Full Play to the Potential of Teaching Equipment

I know that many schools can meet the basic conditions for improving teaching quality mentioned above. If the potential of the education sector can be further developed, schools with current shortcomings can also be quickly supplemented. In terms of teachers, according to various reports, there are still many cases of improper arrangements. Many old professors with specialized knowledge have not taught courses for several years, and many university professors and middle school teachers are not too old and still have sufficient energy, but they have been asked to retire. It is said that there are also many intellectuals in government agencies who have nothing to do. Among the intellectuals registered for labor employment and the social figures contacted by democratic parties, there are many people with specialized skills who have not been used. They feel that they are not lagging behind in patriotism, but they are frustrated because they are unable to do what they want and have nothing to do. This is also a great loss to the country. Many people can be said to be qualified middle and primary school teachers, and can even be university professors, but they are still left idle. If the state can cultivate, utilize and arrange this large group of people properly, their potential can be greatly developed.

In terms of the existing material equipment in schools at all levels, according to surveys, there are also many cases of improper use or even idle use, especially after the adjustment of departments in universities and colleges, many books and instruments have not been rationally allocated and used. If adjustments are made, a large number of potential forces can certainly be discovered. Universities in the same region can formulate a joint use method for books and instruments. After the adjustment of departments in universities after liberation, they are no longer as factional as before liberation. Under the unified leadership of the Party and the government, there will not be much difficulty for universities to cooperate in teaching. I believe that we still have great potential in education that has not been fully developed. If the existing forces can be brought into play, the quality of teaching will definitely be greatly improved. As the quality of teaching can be gradually improved, the burden on teachers and students can also be gradually reduced, because after the conditions for ensuring teaching quality are met, many unnecessary tasks can be avoided, and much waste of human and material resources can be reduced. In other words, the so-called reduction of burden is to reduce the extra burden. Everything is done according to specifications. Whether it is a university, middle school, or primary school, there are certain reasonable teaching requirements. As long as it does not exceed or can meet the necessary requirements, then the so-called burden is the burden that should be borne, and there will no longer be the problem of excessive burden.

In addition, I would also like to talk about the problem that many students cannot enter higher schools this summer vacation. This is indeed a serious problem. But to solve this problem is not without a solution. As long as the government, schools, and social figures work together to think of all possible solutions, the number of people who cannot enter higher schools can be greatly reduced. As mentioned by Committee Member Yang Yizhou, fully implementing the two-part system is one solution. The difficulty of teachers can be solved by selecting from social intellectuals. Many people have also talked about rewarding private schools, which is a method worth considering. For students with better family economic conditions, tuition fees can also be appropriately increased. In terms of universities, I have contacted several schools in Guangzhou that have the conditions to enroll students exceeding the quotas stipulated by the education administrative department. In terms of enrollment, schools still have great potential to be developed. I hope that the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Education, and the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities will further understand the actual situation of the schools and discuss with the school authorities. If conditions permit, more students can still be enrolled. Students who have the conditions to enter higher schools should not be allowed to drop out of school. Of course, it is not possible to expand enrollment quotas as last year. The main guideline is to solve the problem of student enrollment in a realistic manner.

The above opinions are all very immature, and I respectfully ask for your corrections. (Attached picture)

### 努力提高教学质量　李蒸的发言

　　努力提高教学质量
　　李蒸的发言
    在本届大会开幕前听了毛主席关于人民内部矛盾的分析和指示，李富春副总理关于第二个五年计划建议的若干问题的说明；在大会开幕后又听了周总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告和陈云副总理关于市场状况和增产节约的发言，我个人得到了很大的启发和许多的知识，对于我国社会主义建设增加了无比的信心，这充分说明了本届大会的重要性。现在我愿就当前教育问题提出几点意见：
    各级学校学生成倍增加数量质量形成严重矛盾
    解放以来，我国教育事业有了很大的发展，取得了巨大的成绩，拿1949年同1956年比较一下，我国高等学校的学生人数从十一万六千人增加到三十八万人，中等学校的学生数从一百二十六万八千人增加到五百八十六万人，小学学生数从二千四百三十九万人增加到五千七百七十多万人，从这些数字可以看出各级学校都有三倍到五倍的发展，这是解放前不可想像的。去年下半年我到广东视察，了解一些教育情况，仅就广东一省来说，1956年比1955年小学生增加了六十余万，比1949年增加了147％，初中学生增加了八万多人，比1949年增加了170％，高中学生增加了二万多人，比1949年增加了442％，这也说明了去年一年教育事业更是突飞猛进。
    由于学校和学生人数大量增加，产生的困难也是很不少的。因此，在教育上目前也存在着不少的问题，最严重的就是需要与可能的矛盾，和数量与质量的矛盾。另外，我们发现教师和学生的负担还是很重的。由于负担重也就影响了教学质量的提高。教师和学生的健康情况，一般来说，都是不很好的。由于学校扩大了招生名额，学生录取的标准降低了。由于师资不足，不得已采取了逐级提升的办法，师资的质量也降低了。再加上校舍和教学设备不能适应教学的要求，教学工作就难免粗枝大叶了。
    为了提高教学质量和减轻师生过重的负担，首先要考虑教学上有关的各种具体条件，教师的教学能力和学生的学习能力。只看见需要没有注意到可能，就盲目地追求数量是得不偿失的。所以，提高教学质量是当前教育上的基本问题。怎样才能做到呢？首先就是要具备必要的教学条件，也就是大学一定要具备大学教学的条件，中学要具备中学教学的条件，小学要具备小学教学的条件。这些条件是些什么呢？最重要的是合格的各级学校师资。现在许多大学低年级的教学大都由助教或讲师担任，在这方面就不能算是具备了条件，或者可以说是不合乎规格。中学的教学由小学提升的教师来担任也不能算是合乎规格。当然，其中也有合格的助教能担任大学一年级的某科目的教学，优秀的小学教师提升到初中能胜任个别科目的教学，但这是极个别的。我们希望大学学生初进大学就能够身受教授或副教授的教诲，这不但在知识上给学生一个踏实的基础，而且在人格陶冶方面给学生极关重要的影响。因此，师资条件不具备的学校宁可不多收学生。当然，这是与国家的需要有矛盾的，可是教育是不能够廉价得来的。我们在多次教育座谈会上听到反映，近年来有许多大学毕业生到了工作岗位上还要补习基本课程，这岂不是浪费么？除了合格的师资之外，还要有必要的物质环境和教学设备。在这方面许多学校也是很欠缺的。我们看到很多学校的图书、仪器很不够，教室、宿舍过分的拥挤，课外活动场所没有，生活条件很差。国家在大规模的经济建设过程中还不能足够地支付教育经费，学校的物质条件还不能很快的得到满足。虽然在这方面是可以用勤俭办学和精打细算的办法维持下去，但是最低限度的物质设备还是必不可少的。
    充实师资加强教学力量尽量发挥教学设备潜力
    以上所谈的提高教学质量的基本条件，我知道许多学校是可以具备的。如果能进一步发挥教育界的潜力，现在条件欠缺的学校也可以很快地补充起来。就师资来说，据各方面反映还有很多安排不当的情况，许多有专门学识的老教授几年来都没有开课，许多大学教授和中学教师年龄还不算太老，精力也还充沛，就令其退休了。听说机关里边也还有许多无事可做的知识分子。在知识分子劳动就业登记中和民主党派联系的社会人士中有许多学有专长的人还没有被使用，在他们感觉爱国不落人后但是有心无力无事可做的苦闷，在国家也是很大的损失。许多人可以说是合格的中、小学教师，甚至可以当大学教授，但是还在置诸闲散。这一大批人，如果国家加以培养利用和适当安排，是可以大大发挥潜力的。
    在各级学校现有的物质设备方面，据调查也还有许多使用不当甚至搁置不用的情况，尤其在高等学校院系调整之后，很多图书仪器尚未能得到合理的调配使用。如果加以调整，一定也能发掘出很大的一批潜在力量来。同在一个地区的高等学校对于图书仪器是可以订出一种联合使用的办法的。解放后，各大学经过院系调整，已经不是解放前那样派系林立了，在党和政府统一领导下，各高等学校在教学上分工合作是不会有多大困难的，我相信我们在教育方面还有很大的潜力没有尽量的发挥，如果现有的力量能够发挥出来，教学的质量一定能够大大的提高。教学质量能够逐步提高，师生的负担也就能够逐渐减轻，因为保证教学质量的条件具备之后，许多不必要的工作可以不做了，许多人力、物力的浪费可以减少了，换句话说，所谓减轻负担就是减轻额外的负担，一切都按规格办事，无论大学、中学、小学都有一定的合理的教学要求，只要不超过或者能够满足必要的要求，那末所谓负担就是应有的负担，就不会再有负担过重的问题。
    另外，我也谈一谈今年暑假许多学生不能升学的问题。这的确是一个严重问题。但是要解决这个问题也不是毫无办法的，只要政府、学校和社会人士大家群策群力想尽一切办法，不能升学的人数是可以大大缩减的，如杨亦周委员谈到的全部实行二部制就是一个办法。师资困难可以由社会知识分子中选拔。也有许多人谈到奖励私人办学，是值得考虑的一个办法。对于家庭经济状况较好的学生也可以酌量多收一点学费，在大学方面我在广州接触过的几个学校大都有条件可以招收超过教育行政部门规定的名额的学生。在招生方面现在学校还是有很大潜力可以发挥的。希望高教部、教育部和各省市教育厅局再进一步了解各学校的实际情况，同学校当局商酌一下，如果有条件，还是可以多招收些学生，有条件升学的学生，是不应当让他们废学的。当然，照去年那样扩大招生名额是不可以的，主要的方针是实事求是地来解决学生升学的问题。
    以上意见都是很不成熟的，敬请各位指正。（附图片）
