Xinhua News Agency, March 30th: Antarctic Dispatch: In late March, winter, along with the long Antarctic night, descended upon the Antarctic region. In this remote place, which has a century or two of exploration history but remains an "unknown continent," scientists from various countries are effectively organizing and carrying out the largest exploration work in history.

Currently, observation bases of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, Australia, Japan, Norway, Chile, Argentina, and other countries are scattered across the blizzard-swept Antarctic. During the brief Antarctic summer, scientific expedition teams from many countries successively rotated personnel, leaving some behind to persist in the activities of conquering Antarctica during the frigid winter.

As the severe winter approaches, blizzards are roaring around the Soviet Mirny Observatory. Hurricanes have snapped the radio antenna poles of the Vostok scientific station in the Antarctic interior "oasis." Even under these harsh climatic conditions, exploration work continues to expand outward from major bases such as Mirny, Pionerskaya, and Vostok scientific stations. In addition to aircraft penetrating the interior for exploration, two tractor-pulled sledge teams have departed from Mirny and are heading deep into the Antarctic interior.

On March 22nd, scientists at the U.S. exploration base lowered the flag in preparation for spending the six-month-long Antarctic winter night. In the ten days prior, they flew the flag at half-mast in memory of Antarctic exploration hero Rear Admiral Byrd's passing. This explorer, who reached Antarctica five times since 1928, once presided over the first stage of this exploration. In late 1955 and early 1956, he led seven exploration ships, nineteen aircraft, and more than eighteen hundred personnel in establishing "Little America" on Kainan Bay and the McMurdo base near Mount Erebus. Now, the U.S. bases have increased to seven. It is said that the fifth "Little America" base may become the central weather station for the entire Antarctic during the International Geophysical Year. In mid-February of this year, a group of personnel advanced from the fifth "Little America" to Marie Byrd Land in Byrd Bay (80 degrees South latitude, 120 degrees West longitude). One theory holds that the center of the Antarctic low-pressure system (the area with the lowest air pressure in the world), which affects the climate of vast areas of the Earth, may be located here.

British scientists have established bases in the Weddell Sea and Graham Land, among other places.

Japanese scientists have left their footprints on the Antarctic continent again, after a forty-four-year hiatus since 1912. They have established bases near the Ross Sea and the Bellingshausen Sea. The exploration ship "Soya," after being rescued, has sailed to Cape Town, Africa, for repairs. The "Umitaka Maru," which accompanied it, has already submitted a report on Antarctic marine surveys.

Australia has maintained observation bases in Antarctica for the past ten years, regularly rotating personnel. Argentina and Chile have been paying attention to Antarctic exploration for more than ten years, and they both have about seven or eight bases in Antarctica. France has also set up two bases. In addition, Norway, South Africa, and other countries have exploration bases in Antarctica.

### 暴风雪在呼啸　南极夜已降临  各国科学家在寒冬里坚持征服南极的工作

    暴风雪在呼啸　南极夜已降临
    各国科学家在寒冬里坚持征服南极的工作
    据新华社30日讯　南极消息：3月下旬，冬季伴同着漫长的南极夜降临到南极地区。在这个虽有一两百年探险历史但仍然是“未知大陆”的遥远地方，各国科学家正在有成效地组织和进行着有史以来最大的一次考察工作。
    现在在风雪凛冽的南极，分布着苏联、美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚、日本、挪威、智利、阿根廷等国的考察基地。在短暂的南极夏天，许多国家的科学考察队陆续轮换人员，留下一部分人在寒冬里坚持征服南极的活动。
    当严冬来临的时候，苏联和平村观察站一带暴风雪正在呼啸。飓风吹折了南极腹地“绿洲”科学站的无线电天线竿。就是在这种恶劣的气候条件下，考察工作还是从和平村、“少年先锋”、“绿洲”科学站等主要基地不断向外扩展。除了飞机深入腹地考察外，两队拖拉机牵引的雪橇从和平村出发，正在深入南极腹地。
    3月22日美国考察基地上的科学家降落了国旗，准备度过长达六个月的南极冬夜。在这以前的十天中，他们下半旗纪念南极探险英雄柏德海军少将的逝世。这位1928年以来五次到达南极的探险家，曾经主持这次考察头一个阶段的工作。1955年尾到1956年初，他曾经带领七艘考察船、十九架飞机、一千八百多个工作人员，在南极建立了凯南湾上的“小亚美利加”和伊里布斯活火山附近的麦克穆多基地。现在，美国的基地已经增加到七处。据说，第五“小亚美利加”基地可能成为国际地球物理年整个南极的中央测候所。今年2月中旬，一批工作人员已经从第五“小亚美利加”深入到了柏德湾玛丽柏德地（南纬八十度西经一百二十度）。有一种理论认为，影响地球上广大地区的气候的南极低气压体系（世界上气压最低的地区）的中心可能就在这里。
    英国科学家已经在威德尔海、格雷姆等地建立了基地。
    日本科学家自1912年起停顿了四十四年以后，又在南极大陆留下足迹了。他们已经在罗斯海和别林斯高津海附近建立了基地。考察船“宗谷号”在遇救后已经开到非洲开普敦休息。和它同行的“海鹰丸”已经提出了南极海洋调查报告。
    澳大利亚最近十年一直在南极保持有观测基地，经常轮换工作人员。阿根廷和智利都是近十多年一直注意南极考察的国家，它们在南极都有七、八个左右的基地。法国也设了两个基地。此外，在南极设有考察基地的还有挪威、南非等国。
