International Gleanings

    South Vietnamese Peasants Oppose High Rents and Land Seizure
    About 200 peasant representatives from various parts of South Vietnam held a conference in Saigon in early March to oppose landlords' unreasonable collection of high rents and arbitrary repossession of land. The landlords' exploitation of peasants in South Vietnam is still very serious. Regardless of the quality of the land or the harvest, they uniformly collect rent, with the rent amount as high as 25% to 30% or more. Landlords also do not abide by the provisions of contracts and arbitrarily take back land leased to tenants.

    Large Number of Factories Close in South Korea
    According to a survey by the South Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry, by the end of February, 48.1% of all factories in twenty-one industrial sectors in South Korea had stopped production or gone bankrupt. The reason is that the Syngman Rhee clique has implemented a so-called "ultra-tightening" policy since the beginning of this year to cope with inflation caused by military spending, resulting in these factories being unable to maintain production due to a lack of funds.

    US Troops Stationed in Japan Sell Handguns
    A spokesman for the Japanese police authorities said that a total of 841 handguns were confiscated from civilians last year, most of which were handguns used by the US military. Last year, five American soldiers were also arrested for privately selling handguns.

    The spokesman said that the black market price of US military handguns has fallen from 15,000 yen to 5,000 yen per gun, "which shows that there are many handguns currently in the black market."

    Nolan is Unworthy to Attend the United Nations
    Some people in the United States have requested that Senator Republican leader Nolan be removed from his position as a representative in the US delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, believing that he is trying to undermine the United Nations.

    南越农民反对高租夺佃
    南越各地农民代表二百人3月初在西贡举行大会，反对地主不合理地征收高额地租和任意收回土地。南越的地主对农民的剥削仍然很重，他们不管土地的好坏和收成如何，一律统一收租，租额高达25％到30％以上，地主也不遵守契约的规定，任意把租给佃户的土地收回。
    南朝鲜大批工厂关门
    据南朝鲜的大韩商工会议所调查，到2月底止，南朝鲜二十一个工业部门的全部工厂中，有48.1％停止了生产或者破产。原因是：李承晚集团从今年以来实行所谓“超紧缩”政策，以应付由于军事开支引起的通货膨胀，致使这些工厂因缺乏资金而无法维持生产。
    驻日美军出卖手枪
    日本警察当局的发言人说，去年一共从民间没收了八百四十一支手枪，其中大多数是美军用的手枪。去年还逮捕了五个私自出卖手枪的美国兵。
    这位发言人说，目前美军用的手枪的黑市价格已经从每支一万五千日元降到五千日元，“这可以说明目前黑市中手枪很多”。
