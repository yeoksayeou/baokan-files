Also Labor
    Wang Wei
    After reading Mr. Wang Liang's article "Starting with 'Section Chief Niu'" in the "People's Daily" on February 22nd, I have some thoughts. I also oppose general affairs staff like "Section Chief Niu," but I sympathize with the plight of general general affairs staff. Several of my friends work in general affairs; therefore, I know some of the joys and sorrows of general affairs personnel.

    The labor of general affairs personnel in organizations, groups, and schools is not as respected as the labor of workers in production departments in some people's minds. However, general affairs personnel are in charge of supply, so they are directly and closely related to the material needs of everyone in the unit. Everyone's clothing, food, housing, transportation, work and entertainment, marriage and childbirth, illness and death... all material conditions, in the supply system are all, and now mostly, realized through the hands of general affairs staff. The quality of general affairs work is what everyone cares about, and everyone has the right to speak. In many units, general affairs staff receive more scolding than thanks, in addition to normal criticism. When the road is bad, the house leaks, the lights suddenly go out, the toilet malfunctions, or even when an advance cannot be obtained... people scold; sometimes even nannies and guests are no exception.

    A friend of mine who is the head of general affairs at a university, was originally a professor in the economics department. At that time, not many people cared whether he taught well or badly. This is natural, nannies and children, even professors and students from other departments, and even some professors and students from the same department, do not care whether you teach well or badly. But, once he became the head of general affairs, he was miserable, and he was scolded by everyone every day. He often frowned and said to me: "I can't do it! I can't do it! I'll go back to teaching." I advised him: "You can do it, you should do it, and you must do it well. This is one of the most direct and practical ways to serve the people. But to do it well, in addition to studying policies, grasping principles, improving systems, and improving work methods, you must have a high degree of dedication and the spirit of enduring complaints, especially being able to endure being scolded. Being scolded is commonplace for general affairs personnel. If you can't stomach this, you can't be a good head of general affairs. You even have to be able to withstand being the first to be suspected when fighting corruption and waste. Work hard to do a good job and be able to withstand being scolded. This can cultivate a strong will to serve the people." After several勸告, he made up his mind to do it for a lifetime. Over the years, he has done a good job, but he has certainly been scolded a lot. But naturally there is still public opinion.

    Another director of general affairs, is also my friend and colleague. In 1946, we were driven by the enemy from Chengde to Linxi in Inner Mongolia. The government's finances were very difficult. In addition to grain, more than half of our unit's supply often relied on our own production. Our director of general affairs used the only bit of production funds to organize transportation and sales, open a tofu shop, open up a vegetable garden, and also set up a wood shop... finally solving the difficulties, and establishing a small household. In 1947, our army counterattacked, and we also followed south to Chifeng. Before heading south, the director of general affairs said: "Many sources of income cannot be taken away; the unripe vegetables in the vegetable garden cannot be taken away; it is not worthwhile to take away the cut vegetables, what should we do?" We said: "Leave it to the government or residents." He calculated the accounts and said: "This will lose most of the household, it's a bit heartbreaking; and the conditions in the newly liberated area are very difficult." But, we thought that victory must be welcomed, and we cannot be nostalgic for "partial peace" for the sake of a little household. As for handing over the household that cannot be taken away to the people, it is not a loss. If the new area is difficult, then take out the old skills to overcome difficulties and start again. In 1948, the director of general affairs established a household again. We originally planned to spend the winter in Chifeng, so in September we started to accumulate hundreds of thousands of catties of fuel and vegetables. However, before winter, Jinzhou was liberated, and we were going to Jinzhou again, so we "threw away" the fuel and vegetables again. When we arrived in Jinzhou, we spent two months repairing the badly damaged Beidaying by hand, not only had offices and dormitories, the lights were also on, and a converted an airplane hangar into a large auditorium. But, in 1949, we entered the customs again, "throwing" a bigger household in Jinzhou. Time after time, our director of general affairs, his thinking was clear, but emotionally, he couldn't help but feel heartache when talking about "abandoning" the household he had built with his own hands. Naturally, it was not only him, all the people who participated in establishing the household had this kind of emotion; but, as the director of general affairs, his feelings were particularly deep. Later, the environment was very good, but in idle talk, he often missed those vegetables. I sympathize with him very much; is it not a normal psychology for workers to love and miss the fruits of their labor?

    My third friend who works in general affairs is a middle school's director of general affairs. He recently said to me: "I was miserable the past two years, everyone wanted to live a socialist life, their demands were high, furniture and the like, everything had to be new and beautiful, it was difficult to cope with. Now that we are advocating simplification and frugality, it is much better. However, I think that the situation in the past few years, although a bit extravagant and wasteful, has also had a good impact on some people, they initially tasted the taste of socialist life practically, and believed that the future was still very beautiful, so they are firm in taking the socialist road. This time, they have no complaints about practicing simplification and frugality, and their consciousness has indeed improved." I think his words are objective and dialectical.

    Respect labor, cherish labor, and also respect laborers and care for laborers. Although the labor of current general affairs personnel is not productive labor, it is always indispensable to people and beneficial to society. We should also respect and care for this kind of labor and this kind of laborer. If they have shortcomings, anyone can naturally criticize them, but at least, when criticizing the shortcomings in their work, we should also understand their difficulties.

    As for the general affairs workers themselves, they must also fully recognize the significance and value of their labor, thereby continuously improving the quality of their work, correcting their ideological style, and striving for others to respect their labor with actual work results.

    也是劳动
    王纬
    读了2月22日“人民日报”上汪亮先生的“从‘牛科长’说起”一文，我有一些感想。我也反对“牛科长”那样的总务工作人员，但是很同情一般总务工作人员的处境。在我的朋友里面，很有几个做总务工作的；因此，我知道总务人员的一些甘苦。
    机关、团体、学校的总务人员的劳动，在有些人的心目中，不像生产部门的工作者的劳动那样受到尊重。但是总务人员，管的是供给，所以与所在单位的每个人的物质资料的需要，发生直接的密切的联系。每一个人的衣、食、住、行，工作和娱乐，结婚和生育，疾病和死亡，……各方面的物质条件，在供给制的时候是全部，现在是大部，要经过总务工作人员之手而实现。总务工作的好坏，是每一个人所关心的，每一个人都有发言权的。在许多单位里，总务工作人员，除了正常的批评以外，所挨的骂，倒比所得的感谢更多。道路坏了，房子漏了，电灯忽然不亮了，抽水马桶发生故障了，甚至于借支借不到……人们就要骂；有时连保姆和客人也不例外。
    我的在一个大学里当总务长的朋友，原来是经济系的教授，那时他教书教得好坏，人们的意见倒不多。这是当然的，保姆和小孩，甚至于非同系的教授和学生，甚至于同系的某些教授和学生，哪管你的书教得好坏呢。但是，他一当上了总务长，可苦恼了，天天要挨众人的骂。他常常向我皱眉拉脸地说：“干不了！干不了！回头去教书罢。”我劝告他说：“可以干的，也应该干，而且要干好，这是为人民服务的最直接切实的工作之一。但是要干好，除了研究政策，掌握原则，健全制度和改进工作方法之外，必须有高度的任劳任怨的精神，特别要挨得起骂。挨骂是总务人员的家常便饭，吃不了这饭，是当不好总务长的。甚至于要受得了反贪污、浪费时的首先被人怀疑。努力搞好工作而经得起骂，这才能锻炼为人民服务的坚强意志。”劝了几回，他下定决心，干一辈子了。几年来，他工作干得还不坏，挨的骂可实在也不少。但自然公论还是有的。
    另外一个总务处长，也是我的朋友和同事。1946年，我们从承德被敌人撵到内蒙古的林西去了。政府的财政很困难，本单位的供给，除了粮食，常常一半以上要靠自己搞生产来解决。我们的总务处长，运用仅有的一点生产基金，组织运销，开豆腐房，开辟菜园子，还搞了一个木器铺，……总算解决了困难，而且建立起一个小小的家务来了。1947年我军反攻了，我们也就随着南下到赤峰。南下以前，总务处长说：“许多生财是带不走的；菜园子里未成熟的菜更带不走；已经割下的菜，带走也不上算，怎么办？”我们说：“留下，交给政府或居民。”他算了算账说：“这要损失家务的一大半，有点心痛；而且新解放区条件很困难。”但是，我们想，胜利是必须迎接的，不能为了一点家务而留恋“偏安”。至于把带不走的家务交给人民，也不算损失。新区困难，那么，拿出克服困难的老本领再起家。1948年，这位总务处长又建立起家务来了。我们本来是打算在赤峰过冬的，所以在9月间就动手积存了几十万斤的燃料和菜蔬之类。但是，不待过冬，锦州解放了，我们又要去锦州，于是又把燃料和菜蔬之类“丢掉”。到了锦州，自己动手，花了两个月的时间，把被炮弹打得破烂不堪的北大营修复起来，不但有了办公室和宿舍，电灯也亮了，而且把一座飞机窝改造成一个大礼堂。但是，1949年又进关了，把一个更大的家务“丢”在锦州。这样的一次又一次，我们的总务处长，思想是通了的，但在感情上，对于“抛弃”亲手建立起来的家务，谈起来总不免心痛。自然，也不只他一人，所有参加建立家务的劳动的人们，都有这种情绪；但是，作为总务处长的他的这样的心情，是特别深重的。以后环境很好了，但他在闲谈中，还常常怀念那些菜蔬之类。我是很同情他的；劳动者对于自己劳动果实的热爱和怀念，不是一种正常的心理么？
    我的第三个做总务工作的朋友是一个中学的总务主任。他最近对我说：“前两年，我可苦死了，大家要过社会主义生活，要求高，家具之类，什么都要新的，漂亮的，难以应付。现在一提倡精简节约，可好得多了。不过，我看，前几年的情况，虽然有点铺张浪费，但对某些人，也产生一种好影响，他们初步实际地尝了尝社会主义的生活的滋味，并且相信前途还美妙得很，所以对于走社会主义道路是坚定的了。这回的厉行精简节约，他们也无怨言，觉悟确实提高了。”我以为他这话是客观的、辩证的。
    尊重劳动，珍惜劳动，也要尊重劳动者，爱护劳动者。现在的总务人员的劳动，虽然不是生产劳动，但总是对人们不可缺少的对社会有益的劳动。对于这种劳动和这种劳动者，我们同样应该尊重和爱护。他们有缺点，自然任何人都可以批评，但至少，在批评他们的工作中的缺点的时候，对于他们的苦处，也应该体贴体贴。
    至于总务工作者自己也要充分认识自己劳动的意义和价值，从而不断提高自己工作的质量，端正自己的思想作风，用实际的工作成绩来争取别人对自己劳动的尊重。
