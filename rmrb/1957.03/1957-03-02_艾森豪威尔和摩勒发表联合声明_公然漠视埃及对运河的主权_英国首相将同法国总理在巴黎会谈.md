Xinhua News Agency, March 1st: Washington dispatch: French Prime Minister Mollet and U.S. President Eisenhower held three days of talks, which concluded on February 28. The two issued a joint statement.

The joint statement, in discussing the future status of the Suez Canal, stated that both sides agreed that it was of particular importance to ensure "free and unobstructed navigation of the canal without discrimination" and that "the management of the canal be isolated from the politics of any country."

On the entire Middle East issue, the statement only said that they both believed that a solution to the Middle East issue could be "achieved by peaceful means in accordance with the principles of justice and international law."

The joint statement said that Mollet explained to Eisenhower during the talks the progress made in establishing the "European Atomic Energy Community" and the "Common Market," and Eisenhower expressed "concern" over these "successes." Mollet also spoke about the "changes" France was implementing in the political structure of its African territories and reviewed France's plans for Algeria.

The statement said that the two heads of state reaffirmed that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a "fundamental factor" in Western "defense," and pointed out the need to maintain a certain level of troops with conventional armaments and modern weapons in Western Europe. They agreed that "common approaches must be taken" to deal with the so-called "threat of communist imperialism in Europe and other parts of the world."

Xinhua News Agency, March 1st: London dispatch: British government sources revealed yesterday that British Prime Minister Macmillan and Foreign Secretary Lloyd will fly to Paris next week to meet with Prime Minister Mollet before heading to Bermuda in mid-March to meet with U.S. President Eisenhower.

The message said that one of Macmillan's tasks in France is to understand the policies and intentions of the United States through Prime Minister Mollet before the Bermuda conference.

The message said that Macmillan and Mollet will also attempt to "coordinate" the policies of Britain and France in the Middle East, Western European "defense," and other areas during their meeting next week.
