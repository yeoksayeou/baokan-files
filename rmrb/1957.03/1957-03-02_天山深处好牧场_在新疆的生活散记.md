Good Pastures Deep in the Tianshan Mountains
——Life Sketches from Xinjiang
Gu Gong

The car sped along the highway. Groups of silver-gray wild pigeons landed on the road, leisurely loitering until the car's wheels were about to crush their wings, then slowly fluttering up. Tawny foxes peered out from behind the fluffy reeds with their slender eyes and pointed snouts, disappearing in an instant. Occasionally, one or two eagles perched on the tips of telephone poles, intently gazing at the distant sky… Apart from these, all that remained of the sky and earth was a expanse of gray and silver.

The Tianshan Mountains vaguely loomed between heaven and earth, but as the car approached them, they receded into the depths of the mist. After circling around as if playing hide-and-seek for a long time, we finally plunged into the embrace of the Tianshan Mountains and arrived at the Ziniquan (Purple Mud Spring) Pasture. Ziniquan was originally a small, barely noticeable spring; but on either side of it, a vast pasture unfolded.

The head of the pasture had been waiting for us for a long time, his healthy complexion like a brightly burning copper stove. He exchanged a few brief greetings in his Qinghai accent, then immediately began to enthusiastically introduce me to the new pasture: more than 20,000 mu of feeding bases had already been opened up, and more than 10,000 head of sheep, goats, and the finest breed "Lanha sheep" that had been successfully mated in Xinjiang were being raised.

The head of the pasture accompanied us to the "Lanha sheep" pen. Ah! The crowded flock of sheep looked like a huge pile of wriggling cotton. Their faces, eyes, and horns were indistinguishable, all hidden by thick, curly wool. Each sheep had just been washed with medicinal water, so a layer of light brown sulfur had congealed on the outside of their fleece. When I put my hand into the wool, it felt like wearing a heated glove.

Outside the sheep pen, many tattered clothes were hanging. The herdsmen here told me, "These are used to scare away the wolves." Wolves, what detestable beasts! If they broke into the sheep pen, they could bite through the necks of hundreds of sheep in a short while; they would suck a mouthful or two of fresh blood from each still-dying neck. So every snowy night, around the sheep pen, there were always one or two herding warriors, holding rifles, stomping their frozen feet, and walking back and forth. The head of the pasture said, "Now is the wolf-hunting season! Wolves can't run fast in the deep snow, we often ride horses and chase them quickly, hitting them on the head, one blow at a time, one blow at a time..."

From here, we went to the artificial insemination station, and from the artificial insemination station, we went to the ewe's pen, which was far away from the ram's pen. The head of the pasture jokingly said, "This is to prevent them from violating the law and discipline with each other." In the ewe's pen, there were also many newly born lambs. Each lamb had a number pierced in its ear, and an earring dangling below its ear, with various numbers engraved on the earring as well. A young technician who had recently graduated from an agricultural college said to us, "With these numbers and earrings, we can distinguish which lamb was born from which ewe, and whether the next generation is stronger than the previous one." As he spoke, he took out many forms from the room. Ha! These forms were practically the sheep's family tree, recording in great detail the growth and changes of each generation.

After seeing all the sheep pens, the head of the pasture said: The sheep in the pens now are only a very small part, the vast majority of the sheep are still roaming and grazing in the various valleys and grasslands of the Tianshan Mountains.

Grazing sheep – in some people's imaginations, in some poems, it is indeed a very leisurely, very free and easy, and very carefree thing; but when you live with the herdsmen for a period of time, you will deeply realize that this is indeed not an easy task!

Here I met a soldier named Jiang Cunrong, who was originally an excellent marksman, but now he is an outstanding herdsman. He told me with great interest about many aspects of their daily life: whether it was during raging storms or heavy snowfalls, they ate, slept, sheltered from the wind, and avoided the snow with the sheep. A tent and a cloak were all their belongings. Sometimes, when they encountered foggy days, it was even worse; they couldn't see the wolves suddenly appearing, and they couldn't find the sheep that had fallen into the mountain streams, which was the most anxious thing…

I also heard many touching stories from the herdsmen: There was a pregnant ewe that fell into a deep ditch and died, but the soldier, with tears in his eyes, took out the fetus from its belly. He wrapped it in cotton clothes and slept with it every day, and fed it sheep's milk every day. When it grew a little bigger, he fed it salt-mixed bone meal and bran. Finally, this lamb, which had lost its mother since childhood, slowly grew fat and strong… Another time, torrential rain mixed with hail struck the sheep in the Tianshan Mountains, and the sheep fled for their lives. When they squeezed through a small bridge, more than a dozen of them fell into the river. The herdsman jumped into the icy water regardless of his life, and rescued the sheep one by one. After rescuing the last one, he fainted on the shore…

I didn't stay at this pasture for too long, but when I was about to leave, it felt like leaving a long-time home, with infinite reluctance. When I heard each sheep bleating softly, I felt that it was thanking the herdsman; when I saw each pair of sheep-shearing spring clippers gently snapping, I felt that it was blessing the herdsman…

    天山深处好牧场
    ——在新疆的生活散记
    顾工
    小汽车在公路上面疾驰。路上落着一群群银灰色的野鸽，它们从容地徘徊着，直到汽车的车轮要碾到翅膀时，才慢吞吞地飞扑起来。一条条腊黄色的狐狸，从蓬松的芦絮后面，探出细长的眼睛和尖尖的嘴，刹那之间，却又窜得无影无踪。偶尔还有一两只老鹰，蹲在电线杆的尖顶上，入神地凝望着远空……。除了这些以外，整个的苍天和大地，就只剩下一片灰白和银白。
    天山在天地之间模糊地隐现，但在汽车向它靠近时，它却又向薄雾的深处退去。像是捉迷藏似地盘绕了好久好久，我们终于投进天山的胸怀，来到了紫泥泉牧场。紫泥泉原来是一道细小得不易被人发现的泉水；但是在它的两侧，却展现出一片广阔无边的牧场。
    牧场的场长已经等了我们好久，他那健康的脸色，像是烧得红旺旺的铜炉。他用青海省的土音，简略地寒暄了几句，便立刻兴致勃勃地向我介绍：在这个新建的牧场上，现在已经开辟了两万多亩饲养基地，已经饲养了一万多头绵羊、山羊，和在新疆交配成功的最优秀的品种“兰哈羊”。
    场长陪着我们来到了“兰哈羊”的羊圈旁边。啊！那拥挤的羊群，简直像是一大堆会蠕动的棉花。看不清它们的嘴脸、眼睛和羊角，这一切都被厚厚的踡曲的绒毛掩没了。现在每一只羊都刚刚洗过药水澡，所以在毛皮的外面，都凝结着一层浅褐色的硫磺。我把手伸进绒毛里面，简直像是戴上了一副发热的手套。
    在羊栏的外面，挂着许多件破烂的衣衫。这里的饲养员告诉我：“这都是为了吓唬狼群用的。”狼，这是一种多么可憎的野兽啊！它要是闯进了羊圈，一会儿功夫，便能咬断百十头羊只的脖颈；它从每一个还没有完全断气的脖颈里，吸吮一两口鲜血。所以在每一个风雪交加的深夜，在羊圈的周围，总有一两个牧羊的战士，在抱着步枪，跺着冰冻的脚，不停地走来走去。场长说：“现在正是打狼的季节啊！狼在深厚的雪地里是跑不快的，我们常常骑在马上飞快地追逐着，对准狼的脑壳，一棍子一个，一棍子一个……”
    我们从这里又走到了授精站，从授精站又走到了母羊的羊圈，这羊圈离公羊的羊圈很远。场长诙谐地说：“这样可以免得它们互相之间违法乱纪。”在母羊的羊圈里，还有很多头诞生不久的小羊。在每头小羊的耳朵里面都刺着号码，耳朵下面还坠着耳环，耳环上也刻着各种数字。一位在农学院毕业不久的青年技术员对我们说：“有了这些号码和耳环，就可以分清那只小羊是那只母羊生的，下一代是不是比上一代更为强健。”他一面说着，一面又从室内取出很多的表册。哈！这些表册简直就是羊只的家谱，一代传一代，一辈传一辈的生长情况、变化情况，都记载得非常详细。
    在看完所有的羊圈以后，场长说：现在在羊圈里的羊只，还只是极少的一部分，极大部分的羊群，还在天山的各个狭谷中、草滩旁，漫游着、牧放着。
    牧放羊群——在某些人的想像中，在某些诗篇中，确实像是一件非常悠闲、非常洒脱、非常自在的事情；但当你和牧人们在一起生活一段时间以后，便会深深地体会到，这确实不是一件轻松的劳动啊！
    我在这里认识了一位名叫蒋存荣的战士，他本来是位优秀的射手，现在却是一位出色的牧人。他津津有味地告诉我许多他们日常的生活情况：无论狂风大作的时候，无论大雪纷飞的时候，他们都是和羊群在一起吃、一起睡、一起避风、一起躲雪。一顶帐篷、一件大氅，便是他们全部的行装。有时碰上起雾的日子，那就更糟，狼只突然窜来了也看不清，羊只失足掉到山涧里也找不见，这是最最急人的时候……。
    我从牧羊战士的嘴里，还听到了很多感人的故事：有只怀孕的母羊，跌下深沟死掉了，但是战士却含着泪，把它腹中的胎儿取出来。每天裹着棉衣和它一起睡，每天端着羊奶给它喝，等它长大些，又用盐拌着骨粉、麸皮喂它吃。终于，这头自小失去母亲的羊羔，慢慢地长得又肥又壮……。还有一次，暴雨挟带着冰雹，向天山中的羊群袭来，羊群就没命地奔逃，在挤过一座小桥时，竟跌到河里去十多头。那位牧羊战士便不顾生命地跳到冰水里面，把羊只一头一头地捞救上来。在捞完最后一头时，他在岸边昏倒了……。
    我在这个牧场待的时间并不太久，但在要离别时，却像是离别一个久居的故乡一样，有着无限的依恋。我听到每头绵羊咩咩地低叫，就觉得这仿佛是对牧羊人的鸣谢；我看到每把剪羊毛的弹簧剪轻轻弹动，这仿佛就觉得是对牧羊人的祝福……。
