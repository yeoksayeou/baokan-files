Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 28th -- Since June of last year, a new type of wooden, triangular-cone shaped flashing buoy has appeared on the Dongting Lake waterway, replacing the iron floating drums used to indicate night navigation; after more than half a year of trial use, the results have proven to be very good.

In the past, flashing buoys used to indicate night navigation in the center of the lake or river were generally made of iron floating drums. This type of iron floating drum had a nearly 2,000 kg cement base submerged underwater, as well as a nine-zhang-long iron chain and an iron torpedo-shaped floating drum. Buying an iron floating drum cost about 1,000 yuan, and required a large amount of cement and iron. In the dry season, these iron floating drums also obstructed navigation. The wooden triangular-cone shaped flashing buoy is made of several wooden pillars and some wooden boards, with the same dry battery flashing machine inside as the iron buoys. This triangular cone is fixed on a triangular bamboo raft, with four several-zhang-long bamboo ropes tied to the bamboo raft at one end and four grass bags filled with soil at the other end. These four soil-filled grass bags replace the cement base of the iron floating drum, sinking into the water to prevent the buoy from being washed away by wind and waves. Maintenance is also simple; it only needs to be checked every half month, and sometimes a few more grass bags can be added as needed. Manufacturing such a wooden triangular flashing buoy, including the flashing machine, only costs about 100 yuan. It is said that this type of wooden flashing buoy can not only be promoted in inland rivers, but also be tested in the Sichuan River.

### 洞庭湖航道上的新浮标

    洞庭湖航道上的新浮标
    据新华社长沙28日电  从去年6月以来，在洞庭湖的航道上就出现一种代替铁浮鼓指示夜航的木三角锥形闪光浮标；经过半年多的试用，证明效果很好。
    过去在湖心或江心用来指示夜航用的闪光浮标，一般都是用铁浮鼓。这种铁浮鼓有一个沉在水下的近两千公斤的水泥基座，还得有九丈来长的铁练条和一个铁制的鱼雷形浮鼓。买一个铁浮鼓要一千元左右，而且要用去大量的水泥和铁，遇到枯水季节，这种铁浮鼓还有碍航行。木三角锥形闪光浮标是用几根木柱和一些木板制成的，里面安置的干电池闪光机同铁浮标内的一样。这个三角锥体固定在一个三角形竹簰上，用四根数丈长的篾鑬一端系在竹簰上，一端系着四个填满泥土的草包。这四个填了土的草包就代替铁浮鼓的水泥基座，沉下水里，使浮标不致被风浪冲走。维护也简便，只要每隔半个月去检查一次，有时适当加几个草包就可以了。制造这样一个木三角闪光浮标，连闪光的机器在内，只需一百元左右。据说，这种木制闪光浮标不仅可以在内河推广，而且可以在川江试用。
