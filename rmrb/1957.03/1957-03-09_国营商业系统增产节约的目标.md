Goals of the State-Owned Commercial System for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy

Zeng Chuanliu, Vice Minister of Commerce

Actively launching the campaign to increase production and practice economy in the state-owned commercial system, so that commerce can better serve production, people's consumption, and the accumulation of funds for the country, is the due responsibility of state-owned commerce in the country's economic construction.

The state-owned commercial system manages a large amount of state assets, and the potential for increasing production and practicing economy is significant. Over the past few years, the operation and management of the state-owned commercial system have been improved considerably, and the cost of commodity circulation has been reduced accordingly. However, there are still many shortcomings and errors in the organization of commodity circulation. For example, there are still instances of inappropriate commodity distribution in some areas, many institutions and systems are unreasonable or not completely reasonable, and there are still too many links in commodity circulation, preventing further reduction of costs. Losses and waste of state assets are still very serious. Therefore, we should actively carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy on the basis of consolidating and developing achievements, overcoming shortcomings, and improving work, in order to better complete the state-prescribed procurement and sales plans for 1957, supply the market, and stabilize prices. While correctly implementing policies, strive to accumulate more funds.

The basic requirements for the state-owned commercial system to increase production and practice economy should be: further improving commodity circulation work, doing a good job in market supply; improving the level of operation and management, and striving to reduce costs. Thus promoting production, guiding consumption; expanding capital accumulation, and ensuring the needs of national construction. And through the campaign to increase production and practice economy, establish among all employees the idea of cherishing state property, careful calculation, running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and the style of hard work and simplicity.

To achieve these requirements, what should be the focus of the state-owned commercial system in increasing production and practicing economy?

First, it is necessary to actively and systematically expand the organization of goods sources and strengthen supply capacity according to market needs. This is a prerequisite for promoting production and doing a good job in supply. Expanding the organization of goods sources should be carried out in a differentiated and planned manner according to the specific circumstances of production and sales. The sources of major commodities that are uniformly allocated are limited, and only limited sources can be used for reasonable supply, weighing the specific market situation, and making proper arrangements in terms of regions and supply targets. For commodities with an imbalance between supply and demand, efforts should be made to tap the potential of local production and organize local handicraft and rural sideline production to expand sources of goods and strengthen supply capacity. Other commodities, especially those suitable for rural consumption, should be actively organized and vigorously promoted as long as there is a market and raw materials can be solved. In addition, in the existing inventory of many units of state-owned commerce, there are still some commodities that are not suitable for local consumption but are needed or even out of stock in other regions, and timely organization of exchanges or appropriate adjustments should be made. This is an extremely important aspect of increasing production and practicing economy, and it is also the source of doing a good job in market supply, reducing costs, and accumulating funds.

Second, it is necessary to strive to save commodity circulation costs. Saving commodity circulation costs is an important link in the state-owned commercial system to increase production and practice economy. The commodity circulation costs of state-owned commerce are a large figure, and as long as attention is paid to careful calculation and overcoming waste, bit by bit, it can save a lot of funds for the country. In this regard, the most important things are: reasonably organizing commodity transportation, selecting the correct transportation routes, promoting reasonable transportation methods, strengthening the planning of transportation work, reducing transportation links, ensuring the safe transportation of goods, and striving to save transportation costs; it is necessary to further improve commodity storage and strengthen commodity maintenance, promote advanced experience, and reduce commodity losses; it is necessary to improve the settlement work with banks, reduce the occupation of settlement funds, and save interest.

The basic construction investment of the state-owned commercial system should adhere to the principles of being applicable, economical, and ensuring quality. Those that can be done or not should be resolutely not done, those that can be postponed should be temporarily postponed, and those that must be solved should be solved appropriately, but investment should be saved as much as possible and waste should be prevented.

Third, it is necessary to rationally adjust the commercial network, reduce commodity circulation links, and streamline personnel. The work of adjusting organizational structures should be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner under the unified leadership of the central commercial authorities and the commercial administrative departments of various provinces and cities, according to the division of labor between central and local enterprises in procurement, supply, and market sales, and according to the principle of both facilitating market supply and mass purchases and conforming to economic accounting. Management agencies should be streamlined as much as possible, business agencies should generally no longer be extended downward, and some that have already been extended but are improperly set up should be adjusted appropriately. Personnel should be streamlined at the upper levels and strengthened at the grassroots levels in the spirit of a few people doing more things; reduce administrative management personnel and strengthen business personnel; appropriately streamline areas with a better work foundation and support new industrial and mining areas and strengthen areas with a weak work foundation. All state-owned commercial departments must earnestly implement the State Council's "Decision on the Suspension of the Establishment of New Institutions and the Expansion of Staffing by State Organs," and generally no longer recruit personnel from outside the system. If there is a shortage of personnel in new industrial and mining areas, they can be transferred within the system.

Fourth, it is necessary to simplify systems and reports realistically, improve work efficiency, and save manpower, materials, and financial resources. The existing systems and reports of the state-owned commercial system have played an important role in the transformation of private businesses and business operations in the past, but there are cumbersome and complex phenomena, especially due to changes in circumstances, many systems and reports are no longer necessary. Systems and reports should be simplified in a practical way in accordance with the requirements of improving work and improving work efficiency, combined with the actual working conditions of each enterprise, so as to be concise, easy to implement, and meet the needs. Supplementary business reports and additional reports added by various provinces and cities can be studied and simplified by the competent departments of each province and city according to local conditions and according to the specific situation.

Fifth, while carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the state-owned commercial system must also actively guide the masses to conserve consumption according to the supply and demand of different commodities, and cooperate with relevant departments to jointly study increasing production and practicing economy. In terms of commodity quality, procurement units at all levels of state-owned commerce should closely contact production departments to continuously improve product quality and save raw materials. This is an important method to meet the needs of the people under the conditions of insufficient supply of some commodities. Some commodities cannot expand production due to raw material restrictions, and they can study with the production departments to refine and elaborate, thereby increasing the service life of products. In terms of social conservation, state-owned commercial departments should strengthen contact with propaganda departments to guide the masses to conserve consumption. For example, organizing the promotion of experience in saving coal, persuading urban and rural residents to reduce consumption as much as possible for commodities in short supply, easing the tension of commodities in short supply, etc., and from these aspects can also achieve the effect of increasing production and practicing economy.

Whether the campaign to increase production and practice economy can be carried out smoothly depends on strengthening leadership, mobilizing the masses, and relying on the masses. Leading personnel of state-owned commercial departments at all levels should repeatedly explain the necessity and possibility of carrying out the campaign to increase production and practicing economy to all employees in the light of the specific circumstances of their own enterprises, using the methods of enlightening the masses to investigate and study and carefully calculate accounts, so as to improve the level of awareness of all employees, so that they consciously and enthusiastically participate in this campaign, and become specific actions in daily work, thereby establishing the thinking of building the country diligently and thriftily, running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and the fine qualities of cherishing state property and the style of hard work and simplicity. At the same time, it is also necessary to educate employees to constantly study and research policies, increase production and practice economy under the conditions of correctly implementing policies, and prevent the deviation of disregarding policies and one-sidedly saving.

    国营商业系统增产节约的目标
    商业部副部长　曾传六
    在国营商业系统中积极开展增产节约运动，使商业更好地为生产、为人民消费服务，为国家积累资金，是国营商业在国家经济建设中应有的责任。
    国营商业掌管着大量的国家资财，增产节约的潜力是很大的。过去几年来，国营商业系统的经营管理有了不少改进，商品流转费用也相应地降低了；但是，在商品流转的组织工作中，仍然存在着不少缺点和错误。例如：有些地区还有商品摆布不当的现象，有不少机构和制度不合理或不完全合理，商品流转的环节仍然过多，使费用不能进一步降低；国家资财损失、浪费的现象还很严重。因此我们应当在巩固并发扬成绩的基础上，积极地开展增产节约运动，克服缺点，改进工作，以求更好地完成1957年国家规定的收购和销售计划，供应市场，稳定物价；在正确执行政策的前提下，争取积累更多的资金。
    国营商业系统增产节约的基本要求应该是：进一步改进商品流转工作，做好市场供应；提高经营管理水平，努力降低费用。从而促进生产，指导消费；扩大资金积累，保证国家建设需要。并且通过增产节约运动，在全体职工中树立爱护国家财产、精打细算、勤俭办企业的思想和艰苦朴素的作风。
    要达到这些要求，国营商业系统增产节约的重点应该是什么呢？
    首先，必须根据市场需要，积极地有计划地扩大组织货源，充实供应力量。这是促进生产、做好供应工作的先决条件。扩大组织货源要根据产销的具体情况，有区别有计划地进行。统一分配的主要商品，货源是有一定限制的，只能以有限的货源作合理的供应，权衡市场的具体情况，在地区上和供应对象上作妥善安排。供求不平衡的商品，应尽力挖掘地方的生产潜力，就地组织手工业和农村副业生产，以扩大货源，充实供应力量。其他商品，特别是适合农村消费的商品，只要市场有销路、原料可以解决，都应该积极组织货源，大力推销。另外，在国营商业不少单位的现有库存中，还积存着一些不适合当地消费而又为其他地区所需要甚至脱销的商品，应该及时地组织交流或适当调剂。这是增产节约的极其重要的一个方面，也是做好市场供应、降低费用、积累资金的源泉。
    其次，必须努力节约商品流转费用。节约商品流转费用，是国营商业系统增产节约的重要环节。国营商业的商品流转费用是一个很大的数字，只要注意精打细算，克服浪费，一点一滴，汇集起来，就可以为国家节约不少资金。在这方面，最主要的是：合理组织商品运输工作，选择正确的运输路线，推行合理的运输方法，加强运输工作的计划性，减少运输环节，保证商品安全运输，力求节省运输费用；必须进一步做好商品保管和加强商品养护工作，推广先进经验，降低商品损耗；必须改进同银行的结算工作，减少结算资金的占压，节约利息。
    国营商业系统的基本建设投资，应该以适用、经济、保证质量为原则。可办可不办的坚决不办，可以缓办者暂时不办，必需解决的适当解决，但应尽可能地节约投资，防止浪费。
    第三，必须合理地调整商业网，减少商品流转环节，精简人员。调整组织机构的工作，要在中央商业主管部门和各省市商业行政部门统一领导下，根据中央主管企业和地方主管企业在采购、供应和市场销售方面的分工原则，根据既便利于市场供应、群众购买，又符合经济核算的原则，通过缜密的规划有步骤地进行。管理机构尽可能地精简，业务机构一般不再下伸，有些已经下伸但设置不当的，应该适当调整。人员则应以少数人办更多事的精神，精简上层，充实基层；减少行政管理人员，充实业务人员；适当精简工作基础较好的地区，支援新工矿区和充实工作基础薄弱地区。所有国营商业部门必须切实执行国务院“关于国家机关停止增设机构扩大编制的决定”，一般不再从系统外吸收人员。新工矿区人员不足，可在系统内进行调剂。
    第四，必须实事求是地简化制度和报表，提高工作效率，节省人力、物力、财力。国营商业系统现有的制度、报表，在对私商改造和业务经营上过去曾经起过重要的作用，但却存在着繁琐复杂的现象，特别是由于情况的变化，有不少制度、报表已经不再有存在的必要。应该根据改进工作、提高工作效率的要求，结合各企业的实际工作条件，把制度、报表切实地加以简化，做到简明易行，切合需要。各省市增订的业务补充报表和附加的报表，可以因地制宜、因事制宜地由各省市主管部门研究简化。
    第五，国营商业系统在开展增产节约的同时，还必须根据不同商品的供求情况，积极地指导群众节约消费，并配合有关部门共同研究增产节约。在商品质量方面，各级国营商业采购单位应密切联系生产部门，不断提高产品质量，节约原材料。这是在若干商品不足的条件下，满足人民需要的一项重要的方法。有些商品由于原材料限制，不能扩大生产的，可以和生产部门研究精工细作，从而提高产品使用寿命。在社会节约方面，国营商业部门应加强和宣传部门的联系，指导群众节约消费。例如组织宣传节约用煤的经验，劝导城乡居民对供应不足的商品尽可能地减少消费，缓和供不应求的商品的紧张程度等等，从这些方面也可以取得增产节约的效果。
    增产节约运动能否顺利地开展，关键在于加强领导、发动群众和依靠群众。各级国营商业部门领导人员，应该将开展增产节约运动的必要性和可能性，结合本企业的具体情况，用启发群众调查研究、算细账的办法，向全体职工反复地阐明，以提高全体职工的觉悟水平，使他们自觉地、无限热情地参与这一运动，并成为日常工作中的具体行动，从而树立起勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的思想和爱护国家财产的优良品质和艰苦朴素的作风。与此同时，还必须教育职工，经常学习和研究政策，在正确地执行政策的条件下增产节约，防止不顾政策、片面节约的偏向。
