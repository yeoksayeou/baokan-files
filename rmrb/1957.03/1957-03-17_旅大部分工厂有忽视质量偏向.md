Some Factories in Lüda Show Tendency to Neglect Quality

(Our dispatch) A tendency to neglect product quality has begun to emerge in some local industries in Lüda City during the increase production and practice economy campaign.

This year, in order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, the local industrial departments of Lüda City have taken many measures to save raw materials and use substitute materials. However, some factories did not pay attention to effectively ensuring product quality when implementing these measures. For example, in order to save coke, the Dalian Diesel Engine Factory blindly increased the proportion of iron smelting per ton of coke regardless of actual possibilities, resulting in insufficient temperature of the molten iron and a lot of defective products. Coupled with other reasons, the scrap rate of castings in this factory has increased significantly. The scrap rate of castings in the fourth quarter of last year was 7.6%, but by late February this year, it had increased to about 18%. The planned scrap rate of the No. 1 Machinery Manufacturing Factory was 6%, but it actually reached more than 13%.

Some factories have also revised product designs or formulas to save raw materials and use substitute materials, and lowered the consumption quota of raw materials. However, because the experimental research work has not kept up in time, the operating technology has not been improved accordingly, or the technical inspection work has been relaxed in pursuit of output alone, the product quality has also shown a downward trend. The cold bottle rate of thermos bottles produced by the Lüda Glass Products Factory in February increased more than three times compared with January, and the number of explosions also increased about twice as much as in January. The canned bottles produced by this factory also suffered serious damage during use. The Lüda Cultural and Educational Supplies Factory also had some serious quality accidents during the increase production and practice economy campaign. Of the more than 24,000 jin of bulk beauty cream sold by this factory to other places, more than 17,000 jin were requested to be returned or reduced in price. The large bottles of blue ink produced by this factory also grew white mold. The Dalian Enamel Factory required that first-class products of pressed cups reach 50%, but only 3.6% was reached in February. There was not a single first-class product for the joint cups, and the number of substandard products in February increased almost doubled compared to January. In addition, the quality of some products in several other factories has also shown signs of decline.

The above situation shows that the concept of quality must be strengthened in the increase production and practice economy campaign; the increase production and practice economy campaign must be centered on improving product quality; saving raw materials and using substitute materials must be carried out on the basis of effectively ensuring product quality; any negligence of product quality will make the increase production and practice economy campaign fail to achieve the due results.

### 旅大部分工厂有忽视质量偏向

    旅大部分工厂有忽视质量偏向
    本报讯　在增产节约运动中，忽视产品质量的偏向，已开始在旅大市一部分地方工业中露头。
    今年旅大市地方工业部门为了克服原材料不足的困难，曾经采取了许多节约原材料和使用代用材料的措施。但是有些工厂在执行这些措施的时候，没有注意切实保证产品质量。像大连柴油机厂为了节约焦炭，竟不顾实际可能，盲目提高每吨焦炭化铁的比例，以致化出来的铁水温度不够，废品很多；加上其他一些原因，这个工厂的铸件废品率上升了很多。去年第四季度铸件的废品率是7.6％，到今年2月下旬竟提高到18％左右。机械制造一厂废品率计划是6％，实际达到13％还多。
    还有一些工厂为了节约原材料和使用代用材料，修改了产品设计或配方，降低了原材料的消耗定额，但是由于试验研究工作没有及时跟上，操作技术没有相应地改进，或单纯追求产量而放松了技术检查工作，也使得产品质量有下降的趋势。旅大玻璃制品厂2月份生产的暖水瓶，冷瓶率比1月份增加了三倍多，爆炸事故也比1月份增加了约一倍。这个工厂生产的罐头瓶，在使用的时候破损的情况也很严重。旅大文教用品厂在增产节约运动中也发生了一些严重的质量事故。这个工厂卖给外地的两万四千多斤散装美霜雪花膏，要求退货或还原的就有一万七千多斤。这个工厂生产的大瓶蓝墨水也长了白毛。大连搪瓷厂生产的压型口杯，要求一等品达到50％，2月份才达到3.6％。接口口杯则一个一等品也没有，而2月份的等外品比1月份增加了几乎一倍。另外还有几个工厂某些产品的质量也有下降的迹象。
    以上这些情况说明：在增产节约运动中必须加强质量观念；增产节约运动必须以提高产品质量为中心；节约原材料和使用代用材料必须在切实保证产品质量的基础上进行；任何对产品质量的疏忽，都会使得增产节约运动不能取得应有的成果。
