    Diligent and Frugal Housekeeping, Comprehensive Achievement of "Five Goods"
    Tianjin's Hedong District Rewards Over Four Hundred Housewives
    (Report from this newspaper) According to the Tianjin Daily, on the afternoon of March 3rd, Hedong District in Tianjin held a street women's "Five Goods" activist conference to commend and reward four hundred and forty-four skilled women in household labor.

    These housewives are good at managing their households diligently and frugally, educating their children, and constantly encouraging their family members to work hard in production and work; in their positions in household labor, they are also contributing to socialist construction. Among these four hundred and forty-four "Five Goods" activists, two hundred and twenty-nine have family members who are advanced producers, advanced workers, labor models, or outstanding teachers. The family of worker Wang Hongcai has nine members, and her husband earns more than ninety yuan a month. Because she manages their life very well, the whole family has enough to eat and use, and can save some money to deposit every month. She takes good care of her husband, and her husband is also very active in his work. Housewife Zhang Huizhen is also very frugal in her daily life. Her husband earns more than seventy yuan a month, which has to support a family of eight, and there is not much money left for buying clothes. She diligently mends and alters clothes, so that all six children are dressed neatly and cleanly. She also pays great attention to the education of her children. All three of her school-age children are good students and are all Young Pioneers. Among these "Five Goods" activists, many have also achieved good unity and mutual assistance in their families and neighborhoods, and are also good at studying themselves. In the 25th section of the Wangchuanchang Workers' New Village, there is a family group of twenty households that help each other and are as united as one family. None of the workers in the group has ever been absent from work due to family matters, and ten families even have workers who have become advanced producers or labor models.

    At the meeting, seventy family members of employees were also selected as representatives to attend the upcoming Tianjin Municipal Employees' Family Members Representative Meeting. Finally, the Hedong District Women's Federation issued certificates of merit to the "Five Goods" activists and presented each of them with a "flower of honor."

    勤俭持家全面做到“五好”
    天津市河东区奖励四百多家庭妇女
    本报讯　据天津日报消息：3月3日下午，天津市河东区举行街道妇女“五好”积极分子大会，表扬和奖励了四百四十四名在家务劳动中的能手。
    这些家庭妇女善于勤俭持家、教育子女，并且不断地鼓励自己的亲人努力生产、努力工作；她们在家务劳动的岗位上，同样为社会主义建设贡献了力量。在这四百四十四名“五好”积极分子当中，就有二百二十九人的亲人是先进生产者、先进工作者、劳动模范或优秀教师。工人家属王洪才全家九口人，她丈夫每月收入九十多元。因为她把生活安排得很好，全家够吃够用，每月还能节省下一些钱储蓄起来。她对丈夫照顾得很好，她丈夫工作也很积极。家庭妇女张蕙珍过日子也很勤俭，她丈夫每月收入七十多元，要维持大小八口人的生活，添置衣服的钱就不多了。她就勤补、勤拆改，六个孩子都穿得整齐干净。她还非常注意对孩子的教育，三个上学的孩子全是好学生，而且都是少先队员。在这些“五好”积极分子当中，也有很多人做到了家庭、邻里团结互助好，和自己学习好。王串场工人新村二十五段有一个家属小组，二十户人家互相帮助，团结得像一家人，小组里各家没有一个职工因为家务事欠过勤，而且还有十家的职工当了先进生产者或劳动模范。
    会上还选出七十名职工家属为出席即将召开的天津市职工家属代表会议的代表。最后，河东区妇联向“五好”积极分子发了奖状，并给她们每人戴上了光荣花。
