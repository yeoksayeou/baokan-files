Xinhua News Agency, March 27th—The Cotton Production Reporting Conference of Nine Provinces (and Cities) convened by the Ministry of Agriculture concluded yesterday. The conference pointed out that the way to increase cotton production in China this year is to increase the yield per unit area by every possible means, while ensuring the completion of the national cotton planting area plan.

This year, the state's preliminary plan for cotton production requires an increase of more than 13% in yield per unit area compared to last year, and a substantial increase in total output compared to last year and the bumper harvest year of 1955. The conference pointed out that this year, agricultural production cooperatives in various regions have accumulated certain experience in running the cooperatives, cotton production technology has improved, they have prepared improved varieties, established typical examples of high cotton yields, and created some high-yield experiences suitable for local conditions; as long as these conditions are fully utilized, this year's cotton production increase plan can not only be completed, but also be exceeded.

According to the reports from various provinces (and cities), the planned cotton planting area in some regions and agricultural cooperatives still does not meet the requirements of the national plan. The conference hopes that these regions and agricultural cooperatives will make appropriate adjustments according to local conditions and in accordance with the national cotton planting plan.

The conference pointed out that in order to strive for a bumper cotton harvest this year, several tasks must be done well. First, it is necessary to strengthen specific guidance on cotton production and have different guidance methods for different cotton-producing areas. For example, in old cotton-producing areas, we should focus on studying and promoting effective high-yield experiences; in new cotton-producing areas, we should focus on imparting cotton production technology and training local technical cadres; in areas with both cotton and wheat crops, we should focus on promoting the experience of increasing production with both cotton and wheat crops. At the same time, we should also pay attention to the characteristics of cotton production this year and provide timely guidance. Second, we must seize the opportunity to do a good job in various production preparations and achieve timely sowing. Third, we must focus on technical guidance. In addition to continuing to actively promote some technologies that have been effective in the past year, such as timely early sowing, rational close planting, early mid-cultivation, and intercropping techniques in two-crop cotton areas, this year we should also pay attention to field management techniques such as fine pruning, prevention of late-stage pests, flood prevention and drainage, and increasing the number of cultivations. Counties and agricultural cooperatives should formulate technical measures plans for increasing cotton production according to local conditions and guide the implementation in stages according to the season. Technical guidance should be further strengthened in new cotton-producing areas and low-yield cotton-producing areas. Fourth, the guidance of cotton production must be combined with the improvement of the management of agricultural cooperatives. Finally, we must continue to carry out large-scale high-yield campaigns in cotton-producing areas.

### 今年棉花增产的途径是：保证完成国家播种计划，提高单位面积产量

　　今年棉花增产的途径是：
　　保证完成国家播种计划，提高单位面积产量
    新华社27日讯　农业部召开的九省（市）棉花生产汇报会议已经在昨天结束。会议指出，今年我国棉花增产的途径，是在保证完成国家棉花播种面积计划的前提下，千方百计地提高单位面积产量。
    今年国家对于棉花生产的初步计划，要求单位面积产量比去年增加13％以上，总产量比去年和丰收的1955年都有很大增加。会议指出，今年各地农业生产合作社已经积累了一定的办社经验，棉花生产技术有了提高，并且都准备了良种，树立了棉花丰产的典型，创造了一些适合本地情况的丰产经验；只要充分利用这些条件，今年棉花的增产计划就不仅可以完成，而且还可以争取超过。
    根据各省（市）汇报的情况来看，目前有些地区和农业社计划的棉花播种面积，还达不到国家计划的要求。会议希望这些地区和农业社根据当地条件，按照国家的棉花播种计划，进行适当调整。
    会议指出，为了争取今年的棉花大丰收，要做好几件工作。首先，必须加强对棉花生产的具体指导，对不同棉区要有不同的指导方法。例如对老棉区，应该着重研究和推广有效的丰产经验；对新棉区，应该着重传授棉花生产技术、培养当地技术干部；对棉麦两熟区，应该着重推广棉麦两熟的增产经验。同时也要注意今年棉花生产的特点，及时指导。其次，必须抓紧时机，作好各项生产准备工作，做到适期及时播种。第三，要抓紧技术指导，除继续积极地推行去年已有成效的一些技术，如适期早播、合理密植、早中耕、两熟棉区的套种技术等以外，今年同时要注意精细整枝、防止后期虫害、防涝排水、增加中耕次数等田间管理技术措施。县和农业社要因地制宜地订出增产棉花的技术措施计划，按季节分阶段地来指导实施。对新棉区和低产棉区的技术指导，更需要加强。第四，要把棉花生产的指导工作，同改进农业社的经营管理工作结合起来。最后，要继续开展棉区的大面积丰产运动。
