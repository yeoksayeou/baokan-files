　　Improving Government Work Based on Suggestions from People's Representatives and the Masses:
　　Chongqing Seriously Handles Proposals from the People's Congress
　　(Our Newspaper) News: According to the Chongqing Daily, the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee of Sichuan Province is seriously handling proposals from the People's Congress and opinions from representatives and voters.
　　From the start of the city's second grassroots election work in September of last year until early January of this year, the Municipal People's Committee received 262 proposals (including late proposals) from the first sessions of the second Municipal and District People's Congresses and forwarded by the District People's Committees, 97 speeches from Municipal People's Representatives, 32 small group discussion records, and 213 pieces of voter feedback. These proposals, speeches, and opinions collectively reflect the broad masses of citizens' opinions and demands regarding government work.
　　In order to implement the resolutions of the Municipal People's Congress and improve government work based on the opinions of the people's representatives and the masses, the Municipal People's Committee instructed the General Office in mid-January to organize a special force to classify and organize the received proposals, speeches, and group records according to their content and nature. After sorting, there were a total of 1,234 proposals and opinions. These proposals and opinions were all transferred to the relevant business units for handling before February 20.
　　After receiving the proposals and opinions, the units generally designated relevant personnel to be responsible for handling them in the spirit of "every proposal has a resolution, and every item has an explanation." For example, regarding the proposal by 51 representatives, including Wei Xiezhang and Luo Suzhen, to "mobilize the people to raise funds to establish a trolleybus line from Lianglukou to Yangjiaping," relevant units such as the Municipal Finance Bureau began preparing for the construction of this project in January and formally established the Municipal People's Welfare Undertakings Fundraising Committee to specifically handle fundraising work, with plans to complete and open the line in the third quarter of 1958. After receiving Lu Changhua's criticism of the Nantong Coal Mine's waste of coal, forwarded by the Municipal People's Committee, the mine designated relevant functional departments to conduct an inspection in conjunction with the launch of the campaign to increase production and practice economy. During the inspection, they not only discovered the waste of storing substandard coal underground, but also found that the system of fining workers for mining substandard coal was inappropriate. Now, the mine has abolished the substandard coal fine system and has also disposed of the substandard coal originally piled up in the roadways. After receiving criticism from Liu Zhan, Wei Rongzhi, and others regarding the working style of certain grassroots cadres, the Shapingba District People's Committee, in conjunction with the study of the "Eighth National Congress" documents, convened cadres from various townships and street offices and spent five days concentrating on studying documents related to establishing a mass perspective and improving working methods, inspiring everyone to use criticism and self-criticism to consciously examine their work and style, and on this basis, established and improved some necessary work and study systems.
　　Currently, some units in Chongqing have provided written responses to the Municipal People's Committee or voters regarding the handling of these matters.

　　根据人民代表和群众意见改进政府工作
　　重庆市认真处理人民代表大会提案
    本报讯　据重庆日报消息：四川省重庆市人民委员会认真处理人民代表大会提案和代表、选民意见。
    从去年9月该市第二次基层选举工作开始，到今年1月上旬为止，市人民委员会收到市、区第二届人民代表大会第一次会议和各区人民委员会转来的提案有二百六十二件（包括迟到提案在内），市人民代表的发言稿九十七件，小组讨论记录三十二本，选民意见二百一十三件。这些提案、发言和意见，集中反映了广大市民对政府工作的意见和要求。
    为了贯彻市人民代表大会的决议，根据人民代表和群众的意见来改进政府工作，市人民委员会在1月中旬即责成办公厅组织专门力量，对收到的提案、发言稿和小组记录等，按内容性质进行了分类整理。经过整理，共有提案和意见一千二百三十四条。这些提案和意见，在2月20日以前即已全部转交有关业务单位办理。
    各单位在接到提案和意见以后，一般都本着“案案有着落，件件有交代”的精神，指定有关人员负责进行处理。如魏协章、罗素珍等五十一位代表提的“动员人民集资举办两路口到杨家坪无轨电车”的提案，市财政局等有关单位在1月份即进行了筹建这项工程的筹备事宜，并正式成立了市人民福利事业集资委员会，具体办理集资工作，计划在1958年第三季度建成通车。南桐煤矿在接到市人民委员会转去的陆昌华对该矿浪费煤的批评以后，即指定有关职能部门结合开展增产节约运动作了检查。在检查中，不仅发现了井下堆存次煤的浪费现象，而且发现对工人采掘次煤实行罚款的制度不妥当。现在，该矿已将次煤罚款制度取消，对原来堆在巷道内的次煤也作了处理。沙坪坝区人民委员会接到刘瞻、魏荣治等对某些基层干部工作作风的批评意见后，即结合“八大”文件的学习，召集各乡和街道办事处干部，利用五天时间，集中学习有关树立群众观点和改进工作方法的文件，启发大家采用批评和自我批评的方法，自觉地检查工作和作风，并在此基础上建立和健全了一些必要的工作和学习制度。
    现在，重庆有些单位已把处理情况，向市人民委员会或选民作了书面答复。
