Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 1st: March 1st is the first "National People's Army Day" of the German Democratic Republic. Over 1,200 people from all walks of life in Berlin held a grand celebration rally on the evening of February 28th at the Metropol Theater. Those present at the meeting included Premier Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic, Deputy Premiers Nuschke and Loch, and representatives from all walks of life.

Stoph, Minister of National Defense of the German Democratic Republic, spoke at the meeting. Stoph said that the German Democratic Republic has the obligation to defend socialist construction and to protect the territory and borders of democratic Germany from the invasion of imperialist enemies. The dangerous development in West Germany and the aggressive intentions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries particularly place this task before the young worker-peasant state.

Stoph said that at present, more and more counter-revolutionary groups and bandits are being formed and trained in West Germany, preparing to be sent to the Republic to carry out activities that undermine the worker-peasant regime. Now West German militarists are accelerating the establishment of the West German mercenary army. By this spring, they have already armed 72,000 people. This development has brought great danger to European peace.

Stoph said that therefore, improving the Republic's defense capabilities is the top task of the working class and all working people. He said: "The National People's Army must be prepared to, together with the Soviet officers and soldiers acting in compliance with the Warsaw Treaty alliance obligations, defeat any conspiracy to solve the German question by force and subvert the people's democratic system in democratic Germany."

Stoph then said that the characteristic of the People's Army lies in its determination to practice the lofty beliefs of socialist internationalism. In the first year of its establishment, it has already developed close friendly relations with the Soviet Union and the armed forces of all socialist countries. He said that we will resolutely smash all attempts to undermine our friendship by using so-called "national communism" "separation from the Soviet Union" and other provocative slogans.

Stoph finally said that the People's Army must now further consolidate the foundation that has been built and make the various arms and services a fighting force capable of using modern weapons and technological means, and be prepared to defend the socialist achievements of our worker-peasant state and prevent any enemy from invading.

Lieutenant General Koshevoy, Deputy Commander of the Soviet Forces stationed in Germany, spoke at the meeting. He congratulated the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic on behalf of Marshal Grechko, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Forces stationed in Germany, and all Soviet officers and soldiers. He emphasized that all conspiracies of the imperialists to solve the German question by force will be completely shattered in the face of the united armed forces of the socialist countries.

    柏林集会庆祝国家人民军节
    斯多夫指出提高国防力量是头等任务
    据新华社柏林1日电  3月1日是德意志民主共和国第一届“国家人民军节”。柏林各界人士一千二百多人2月28日晚上在都会大剧院举行了隆重的庆祝大会。出席大会的有民主德国总理格罗提渥、副总理努舍克、洛赫和各界代表。
    民主德国国防部长斯多夫上将在会上讲了话。斯多夫说，德意志民主共和国有义务保卫社会主义建设和使民主德国的领土和疆界不受帝国主义敌人进犯，德国西部的危险发展和北大西洋公约国家的侵略目的特别给年青的工农国家提出了这一任务。
    斯多夫说，目前，在西德组成和训练了越来越多的反革命团体和匪徒，准备派遣到共和国来进行破坏工农政权的活动。现在西德军国主义者正在加速西德雇佣军的建军工作。到今年春天，他们已经武装了七万二千人。这种发展给欧洲和平带来了巨大的危险。
    斯多夫说，因此，提高共和国的国防力量是工人阶级和所有劳动人民的头等任务。他说：“国家人民军必须准备着同遵守华沙条约的联盟义务而行动的苏军官兵一道，击溃任何企图以武力解决德国问题和颠复民主德国人民民主制度的阴谋”。
    斯多夫接着说，人民军的特点就在于它决心实践社会主义国际主义的崇高信念，在它成立的第一年内，已经同苏联和所有社会主义国家武装部队之间发展了紧密的友好关系。他说，我们将坚决地粉碎所有想利用所谓“民族共产主义”“脱离苏联”等煽动性口号来破坏我们的友谊的企图。
    斯多夫最后说，人民军现在要进一步巩固已经建成的基础，和使各兵种部队成为具备使用现代武器和技术手段的战斗力量，为保卫我们工农国家的社会主义成就和防止任何敌人的进犯作好准备。
    驻德苏军副司令柯歇沃伊上将在会上讲了话。他代表驻德苏军部队总司令格列奇科元帅和全体苏军官兵向民主德国国家人民军祝贺。他强调指出，帝国主义者想用武力解决德国问题的一切阴谋都将在社会主义国家的联合武装力量面前遭到彻底粉碎。
