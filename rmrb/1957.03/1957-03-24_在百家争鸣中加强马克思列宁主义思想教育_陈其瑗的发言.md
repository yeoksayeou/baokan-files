I wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao's instructions at the Supreme State Conference on correctly handling contradictions among the people, and Premier Zhou's report on his visit to eleven Asian and European countries. I agree with Vice-Chairman Chen Shutong's summary report on the work of the Standing Committee, Vice-Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of the Second Five-Year Plan, and the special speeches by Vice-Premier Chen Yun and President Dong Biwu.

Now, please allow me to express my immature personal opinions on the issue of strengthening Marxist-Leninist ideological education in the context of the "Hundred Schools of Thought" debate. If I am wrong, please correct me.

Since the basic victory of socialist transformation last year, the Chinese Communist Party has put forward the policy of "Hundred Schools of Thought" and further implemented the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" in academic and artistic fields. In party relations, it has proposed the policy of "Long-term Coexistence and Mutual Supervision," expanding the people's democratic life in many ways and further consolidating and developing our country's people's democratic united front.

In this process, some unhealthy ideas and unclear understandings of the boundaries between right and wrong have become more easily apparent. For example, some people confuse bourgeois democracy with proletarian democracy, ignoring the class content of democracy; some people overemphasize democracy and freedom, ignoring centralization and dictatorship; some people believe that the national bourgeoisie only has one side, with no dual nature anymore; among a minority of young students and intellectuals, there is a tendency to only talk about professional skills and neglect politics; a few cadres reflect the sentiments of landlords and rich peasants on the issue of the superiority of agricultural collectivization, and so on. The existence of these thoughts and emotions shows that there is a need to further strengthen Marxist-Leninist ideological education in our ideological field. Only by doing this work well can we distinguish right from wrong, distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, and unite more closely around the Communist Party, moving towards the common path of building socialism.

I believe that Marxism-Leninism is scientific truth, the criterion for the proletariat to understand the world and then transform it, and the guide for our actions. Those who adhere to it will succeed, and those who violate it will fail. The Chinese Communist Party also suffered significant losses in the revolutionary cause because Chen Duxiu, Zhang Guotao, and "Left" and Right opportunists violated it. Because Chairman Mao Zedong insisted on using the magic weapon of Marxism-Leninism and creatively guided the Chinese revolution, the Chinese revolution and construction cause has been victorious in everything it undertook. Practice is the standard of truth. The glorious history of the Chinese Communist Party proves that Marxism-Leninism is the truth. The former leaders of the Hungarian People's Republic violated certain principles of Marxism-Leninism, allowing imperialism to take advantage of the situation, causing the Hungarian people to suffer greatly. The Hungarian incident also proves that the truth of Marxism-Leninism cannot be violated in the slightest; violating it invites such a major disaster.

The Chinese Communist Party combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, advancing along the basic path of the Soviet October Revolution, while also making creations and developments. This experience is extremely valuable. It is not only the property of our nation but will also be a reference for all nations in their struggle to realize socialism and communism.

The correctness and scientific nature of Marxism-Leninism are rarely doubted in our country. The importance of strengthening Marxist-Leninist ideological education for Communist Party members is also not doubted by anyone. However, the current questions are: for the sake of common cause and common victory, should non-Party members accept Marxist-Leninist ideological education? Is there a contradiction between emphasizing Marxist-Leninist ideological education and the "Hundred Schools of Thought" policy?

    Non-Party members also need to accept
    Marxist ideological education

Some people think like this: Marxist-Leninist ideological education is only for CCP members, and non-Party members do not yet have this condition and can wait and see. It is true that the Chinese Communist Party does not impose the same constraints on non-Party members as it does on Party members. In organization, it advocates "long-term coexistence"; in academics, it advocates "Hundred Schools of Thought"; and in ideological reform, it advocates conscious voluntarism and does not seek quick results. This is the Chinese Communist Party's wise and correct policy of long-term ideological education for non-Party members. This policy has been wholeheartedly supported by people from all walks of life. But I believe that, even so, as members of democratic parties, realizing our historical role, we should have a conscious and voluntary desire to accept Marxist-Leninist ideological education, strive to improve our political and ideological level, cooperate with the Party's various tasks, drive forward the social strata that we can connect with, turn negative factors into positive forces, and accelerate the process of socialist construction.

Currently, although the Chinese Communist Party has developed to 12 million members, it is still a minority compared to the population of 600 million. The continuous strengthening of the Party's power is inseparable from the common progress of members of democratic parties. Members of democratic parties consciously keep up in terms of ideology and work, so that the Party's leading force is powerfully supported by the role of democratic party assistants, and the exemplary role of Party members will not form an isolated army. As the saying goes: "No matter how beautiful the peony is, it also needs green leaves to support it." This is also the glorious responsibility of members of democratic parties.

We acknowledge the long-term and arduous nature of ideological transformation. So-called ideological transformation is ideological struggle. In this struggle, one contradiction is overcome, and another contradiction arises. Just after passing one hurdle, there is another hurdle ahead. Among members of democratic parties, there are quite a few over the age of forty. How can we approach the level of Party members in our forties when we are supposed to be "unperplexed," and even in our seventies when we are not supposed to "transgress the rules," truly achieving the state of "unperplexed" and "not transgressing the rules"? Apart from consciously, earnestly, and actively accepting Marxist-Leninist ideological education, there is no other way to follow. Marxism-Leninism is not a mysterious and unattainable thing. As long as we encourage each other, criticize each other, thoroughly change our old class consciousness, strengthen our study of Marxist-Leninist theory and Party policies, and constantly train ourselves in practical work and life, those who have a will can accomplish anything. One day, non-Party members will also be able to become true Marxists. Only when we are ideologically armed with Marxism-Leninism and concretely apply it to practice can non-Party members approach the Party's organization and the people's demands; can we truly play the role of "mutual supervision"; can we correctly grasp the boundaries between the individual and the collective, the present and the future, democracy and centralization, democracy and dictatorship, freedom and leadership, right and wrong, revolution and counter-revolution; and can we demonstrate the same firm stance as Party members in any complex moment or sudden event. Therefore, emphasizing Marxist-Leninist ideological education is important for Communist Party members, and it is also important for non-Party members. This is the meaning of "everyone can strive to be like Yao and Shun."

Only by mastering Marxism can we truly exert free creation and independent thinking

Some people also ask: In an atmosphere that advocates "Hundred Schools of Thought," emphasizing Marxist-Leninist ideological education for non-Party members, isn't that contradictory to the aim of free creation and independent thinking? My humble opinion is just the opposite. Only by mastering Marxism-Leninism can we truly exert the role of free creation and independent thinking.

    "Hundred Schools of Thought" is our country's current historical reality. There are various classes, various thoughts. Debating it out is greatly beneficial for exposing thoughts, adopting strengths and discarding weaknesses, and achieving a unified understanding; for jointly improving ideological level; and for accelerating the advance of culture and science. It is not good to keep opinions hidden in one's heart for a long time without being able to eliminate them, creating a phenomenon of "hiding them in the center, when will they be forgotten?" Regularly letting "small democracy" debate, will not lead to "big democracy" roaring up. In addition, in order to implement the spirit of "correcting mistakes without fail," we must further create an atmosphere of boldly expressing opinions through "Hundred Schools of Thought," dispelling the concern of "speaking frankly brings disaster."

Hundred Schools of Thought of course means that all Hundred Schools have equal rights to express their thoughts and that we want debate and not just solo performances. But at the same time, we must also pay attention to the fact that our debate is for the victory of socialist construction, for the ultimate realization of communism in our country. It is necessary to promote mutual criticism and distinguish between right and wrong among the Hundred Schools. Therefore, Marxism-Leninism, as the highest criterion for mutual criticism and distinguishing between right and wrong in the process of Hundred Schools of Thought, cannot be ignored.

Marxism-Leninism is not only the fundamental ideology of establishing a socialist country and the guiding ideology of a proletarian political party; since democratic parties, democratic personages, and senior intellectuals work, study, and live in a socialist country, and are willing to struggle under the leadership of the proletarian political party—the Chinese Communist Party—for the goal of ultimately realizing a communist society in China; and since revolutionary practice has proven that Marxism-Leninism is the highest criterion for our words, actions, and thoughts; then we should not simply regard Marxism-Leninism as just one of the Hundred Schools.

Facts have also proven that Marxism-Leninism is indeed such a criterion. I heard that this time many members, after listening to Chairman Mao's report at the Supreme State Conference on "Correctly Handling Contradictions Among the People," expressed that their thinking was clarified and their understanding was improved. After repeated discussions in group meetings, everyone unanimously supported Chairman Mao's report, reaching a unity of ideological understanding. Why does Chairman Mao's report have such a strong persuasive power? Precisely because Chairman Mao's report creatively solved the main problems in our country's current political life based on the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism combined with the specific conditions of China today. Secondly, it is also because we all voluntarily and consciously take Marxism-Leninism as the highest criterion for mutual criticism, distinguishing between right and wrong, and guiding work and thought.

Under the current conditions in our country, with Marxism-Leninism as the criterion, we do not have to fear that the debate will become a chaotic debate at all; in the full development of free discussion in the "Hundred Schools of Thought," Marxist-Leninist ideological education will inevitably be strengthened. The "Hundred Schools of Thought" debate and Marxist-Leninist ideological education complement each other and promote each other. There are contradictions between the two, but they can be unified.

The "Hundred Schools of Thought" debate and Marxist ideological education complement each other and promote each other

Fellow Committee Members, Fellow Comrades! We have all read this sentence: "Let the weak water be three thousand, I only take a gourdful to drink." This is a very vivid language left to us by the author of Dream of the Red Chamber, through Jia Baoyu's mouth, on how to conduct oneself and pursue knowledge. In my personal opinion, this sentence has enlightening and educational significance for our petit-bourgeoisie's fault of being fickle and half-hearted. Our petit-bourgeoisie's common malady is that when encountering the complex principles of "three thousand weak waters," we often become greedy and desire too much, swallowing things whole, and often cannot persist in "drinking one gourdful," even thinking that we have a broad mind that is inclusive of everything!

The petit-bourgeois socialist ideology of "cowardly complaints," which was already criticized by the Communist Manifesto more than a hundred years ago, is currently prevalent among so-called "politicians" and "scholars" in some countries internationally. They are using revisionist goods to label Marxist trademarks, self-producing and self-selling, and sometimes even have a considerable free market. Doesn't this also illustrate the dreadfulness of such wavering? I fear lest purple steals the red, and I fear lest fish eyes are mixed with pearls. Therefore, in the struggle between the two ideological trends (Marxism-Leninism and revisionism) in the international socialist movement, we must be vigilant against this wavering and adhere to the Marxist-Leninist stand, consolidating the proletarian internationalist stand.

Marxism-Leninism is a truth that applies universally, but it is not static but developing. Leninism is the development of Marxism, and Chairman Mao's outstanding theory is also the development of Marxism-Leninism. China's "Hundred Schools of Thought" is just budding, and in the near future, it will surely make Marxism-Leninism bloom with more colorful flowers in the Chinese national form and bear more fruits that are rich in nutrition for all mankind on the road to socialism and communism!

Long live the great, scientific Marxism-Leninism! (Attached image)

### 在百家争鸣中加强马克思列宁主义思想教育　陈其瑗的发言

专栏：

    在百家争鸣中加强马克思列宁主义思想教育
　　陈其瑗的发言
    我衷心拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上的正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题指示和周总理的关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告。我同意陈叔通副主席的常委会工作总结报告，李富春副总理的关于第二个五年计划的说明以及陈云副总理和董必武院长的专题发言。
    现在请允许我就百家争鸣中加强马克思列宁主义思想教育这一问题，发表个人一点不成熟的意见。说得不对，请求指正。
    自从去年社会主义改造获得基本胜利以后，中国共产党在学术上文艺上提出了
  “百家争鸣”和进一步贯彻执行“百花齐放”的方针，在党派关系上提出了“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，多方面扩大了人民民主生活，更进一步巩固和发展了我国的人民民主统一战线。
    在这个过程中，某些不健康的思想和对是非界限模糊不清的认识，也就更容易显现出来。例如有人把资产阶级民主和无产阶级民主混为一谈，忽略了民主的阶级内容；有人过分强调民主和自由，忽略了集中和专政；有人认为民族资产阶级只有一面性，再没有两面性了；在少数青年学生和知识分子中，出现了只讲业务技术忽视政治的倾向；少数干部在农业合作化优越性问题上，反映了地主富农的情绪等等。这些思想情绪的存在，说明了在我们思想领域中有进一步加强马克思列宁主义的思想教育的必要。只有作好这个工作，才能够使我们辨别是非，分清敌我，更紧密地团结在共产党周围，走向共同建设社会主义的道路。
    我认为马列主义思想就是科学真理，就是无产阶级认识世界进而改造世界的准则，也就是我们行动的指南，操之者胜，违之者败。中国共产党也曾因陈独秀张国焘和“左”右倾机会主义者违之而遭致革命事业的重大损失；由于毛泽东主席坚持运用了马列主义这个法宝，创造性地指导中国革命，中国革命与建设事业才无往而不胜利。实践是真理的标准，中国共产党的光荣历史证明了马列主义即是真理。匈牙利人民政府过去的领导人违反了马列主义的某些原则，使帝国主义有隙可乘，使匈牙利人民吃了大亏。匈牙利事件也证明马列主义真理丝毫违反不得，违之就招来这场重大灾难。
    中国共产党以马列主义的普遍真理和中国革命具体实践相结合，沿着苏联十月革命的基本道路前进，而又有创造和发展，这种经验是极其宝贵的，它不仅是我国民族的财产，而且会是各国民族在为实现社会主义共产主义而斗争的参考资料。
    马列主义的正确性和科学性，在我们的国家里是很少有人怀疑的。对共产党员加强马列主义思想教育的重要性也是没有人怀疑的。但是，现在的问题是：为了共同事业和共同胜利，党外人士要不要接受马列主义思想教育呢？强调马列主义思想教育和“百家争鸣”的方针有无矛盾呢？
      党外人士也需要接受
      马克思主义思想教育
    有人这样想：马列主义思想教育只是对中共党员而言，党外人士还没有这个条件，尽可以慢慢再说吧。诚然，中国共产党并没有对党外人士进行对党员同样的约束，在组织上提倡“长期共存”，在学术上提倡“百家争鸣”，在思想改造上更提倡自觉自愿，不求之过急。这是中国共产党对党外人士进行长期思想教育的英明而正确的方针。这一方针得到了各阶层人士的衷心拥护。但我以为，即使如此，作为民主党派的成员，体会到自己的历史作用，应该有接受马列主义思想教育的自觉自愿的要求，努力提高政治思想水平，以配合党的各种工作，带动自己所能联系的社会阶层前进，变消极因素为积极力量，以加速社会主义建设的行程。
    目前中国共产党党员虽然发展到一千二百万人，但与六亿人口来比较，毕竟是少数。党的力量不断加强与民主党派成员的共同进步是分不开的。民主党派成员自觉地在思想方面工作方面跟上去，使党的领导力量得到民主党派助手作用的有力配合，使党员的模范带头作用在群众中不会形成孤军突出，正如俗话所说：“牡丹虽好也要绿叶扶持”。这也是民主党派成员的光荣责任。
    我们承认思想改造的长期性和艰苦性。所谓思想改造就是思想斗争，在这斗争中一种矛盾克服了另一种矛盾又会发生，刚刚过了一关前面还有一关。民主党派成员在四十岁以上的不在少数，怎样才能够在四十“不惑”以至七十“不逾矩”的年纪里接近党员的水平，真正达到“不惑”和“不逾矩”的地步呢？这除了自觉地认真地积极地接受马列主义思想教育，是别无他途可循的。马列主义不是神秘的高不可攀的东西，只要我们彼此共勉，互相批评，彻底改变旧的阶级意识，加强对于马列主义理论和党的政策的学习，在实际工作中与生活中经常锻炼，有志者事竟成，总有一天，党外人士也能够成为真正的马克思主义者。只有在思想上以马列主义武装起来并具体地运用到实践当中，党外人士才能够与党的组织和人民的要求接近；才能够真正起到“互相监督”的作用；才能够把个人与集体、眼前与将来、民主与集中、民主与专政、自由与领导、是与非、革命与反革命的界线正确地掌握起来；才能够在任何复杂关头和突然事变面前，表现出和党员同样坚定的立场。所以，强调马列主义思想教育，对共产党员固然是重要的，对党外人士说来也是重要的。这是“人人皆可以致力为尧舜”的意义。
    只有掌握了马克思主义，才能真正发挥自由创造和独立思考
    又有人这样问：在提倡“百家争鸣”的气氛里，强调对党外人士进行马列主义思想教育，岂不是与自由创造、独立思考的宗旨大相矛盾吗？我的浅见恰恰相反。只有掌握了马列主义，才能真正发挥自由创造、独立思考的作用。
      “百家争鸣”是我国当前的历史现实，有各种阶层，有各种思想，鸣一鸣，对于暴露思想，絜长弃短，取得一致的认识；对于共同提高思想水平，对于加速文化进军科学进军，都有很大好处。有意见藏在心里而久久不能消释，造成“中心藏之，何日忘之”的现象，这是不好的。经常让“小民主式”鸣一鸣，就不会导致“大民主式”的轰鸣起来。此外，为了要贯彻“有错必纠”的精神，我们更要通过百家争鸣造成大胆发表意见的风气，解除“直言贾祸”的顾虑。
    百家争鸣当然是百家都有鸣的平等权利，要争鸣而不要独鸣。但同时也要注意到，我们的争鸣是为社会主义建设的胜利而争鸣，为在我国最终实现共产主义而争鸣，在百家中提倡互相批评、明辨是非是必要的。因此，在百家争鸣过程中作为互相批评和明辨是非的最高准则的马列主义就不容忽视了。
    马列主义既是社会主义国家立国的根本思想，是无产阶级政党的指导思想；民主党派、民主人士和高级知识分子既然工作、学习和生活在社会主义国家里，并且愿意在无产阶级政党——中国共产党的领导下，为在中国最终实现共产主义社会的目标而奋斗，在革命实践过程中，证实了马列主义是我们言论、行动和思想的最高准则；那么就不应简单地把马列主义仅仅看作百家中的一家。
    事实也证明了马列主义确实是这样的准则。我闻说这次许多委员在听了毛主席在最高国务会议上所作的“正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告后，都表示澄清了思想，提高了认识，经过小组会反复讨论，大家一致拥护毛主席的报告，达到了思想认识上的统一。为什么毛主席的报告有如此强大的说服力呢？就因为毛主席的报告是根据马列主义的普遍真理结合了中国当前的具体情况创造性的解决了当前我国政治生活中的主要问题。其次也因为我们大家是自愿自觉地以马列主义为互相批评、明辨是非以及指导工作和思想的最高准则的缘故。
    在我国当前的条件下，有了马列主义作为准则，我们丝毫不必害怕争鸣会变成乱鸣；在百家争鸣充分开展自由讨论中，必然还会加强马列主义思想教育。百家争鸣与马列主义思想教育是相得益彰，互为推动的，二者之间不是没有矛盾，但是可以统一的。
    百家争鸣与马克思主义思想教育是相得益彰互相推动的
    各位委员、各位同志！我们大都读过这句话：“任凭弱水三千，我只取一瓢饮”。这是红楼梦作者借贾宝玉之口留给我们一句在做人治学上很形象化的语言。我个人的见解，这句话对我们小资产阶级见异思迁、三心两意的毛病，是具有启发教育意义的。我们小资产阶级的通病是，碰到“弱水三千”的复杂事理，常会贪多图大，囫囵吞枣，常常不能坚持“一瓢饮”下去，还自以为有兼容并包的广阔胸襟哩！
    早在一百多年前已为共产党宣言所批判过的“怯懦的怨声”的小资产阶级社会主义，目前正在国际上某些国家的所谓“政治家”和“学者”中流行着，他们正以修正主义的货色贴上马克思主义的商标自产自销，有时竟有不小的自由市场，不也说明这种动摇性的可怕吗？紫恐其夺朱也，鱼目恐其混珠也。所以在国际社会主义运动两种思潮（马列主义与修正主义）的斗争中，我们必须警惕这种动摇性，坚持马列主义的立场，巩固无产阶级国际主义的立场。
    马克思列宁主义是放诸四海而皆准的真理，但它不是静止的而是发展的。列宁主义是马克思主义的展开，毛主席的卓越理论也是马列主义的展开。中国的“百家争鸣”刚在萌芽，不久的将来一定会在伟大祖国肥沃土壤上，使马列主义开出更多中国民族形式的鲜艳的花朵，结出更多对于走向社会主义共产主义的全人类有丰富营养的果实来！
    伟大的、科学的马克思列宁主义万岁！（附图片）
