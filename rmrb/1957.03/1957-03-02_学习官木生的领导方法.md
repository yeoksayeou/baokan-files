    Learning Guan Musheng's Leadership Methods
    Guan Musheng, a delegate to the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference and the director of the Changfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, uses participation in production labor as a leadership method to deeply engage with the masses, solving many problems in the production leadership of the entire agricultural cooperative. His leadership method is worthy of promotion.
    After the comprehensive realization of agricultural cooperation, the cadres of agricultural production cooperatives in various regions have encountered some difficult problems regarding how to conduct leadership work that remain unresolved.
    There are some agricultural cooperative cadres who, after being entrusted by cooperative members to assume leadership positions, especially after the establishment of larger-scale advanced cooperatives, no longer directly participate in production labor. The vast majority of them are not lazy people, but feel that there are too many things to do, and that directly participating in production labor would be too much to handle, hindering the major affairs of leading the entire cooperative.
    There are also some agricultural cooperative cadres who are very willing to participate in the cooperative's production labor. However, their main purpose in doing so is to earn more work points for themselves. They bury themselves in production, work hard, and can play a leading role in a team or group, but they neglect the leadership of the entire cooperative's work, even leaving the cooperative's official business unattended.
    The difficult problem arises here: If you don't directly participate in production, the cooperative members will have opinions, saying that you are a "hands-off manager"; family members will also have opinions, saying that you don't take care of family life. If you participate in production labor, other cadres will say that you only care about yourself, and that being a cooperative cadre is just a "nominal title." Many cooperative cadres are troubled by being "attacked from all sides" and don't know what to do.
    What should be done? Guan Musheng answered this difficult question with his practical actions and successful experience. This provides a good example for all agricultural cooperative cadres. After careful observation and reflection, Guan Musheng realized from practical work that the best working method is "participate in production, lead production" – both participate in production and lead production; only by participating in production can you lead production; the main purpose of participating in production is to better lead production.
    In a sense, for cooperative cadres, separating from production means separating from the masses. In agricultural cooperatives, the cooperative members all participate in direct production labor, and most of their daily activities are spent in direct production labor. If cooperative cadres do not participate in direct production labor, they will naturally become separated from the masses. Separated from production, they cannot directly understand the various specific situations that are constantly changing in production activities, and naturally cannot lead production well. Separated from the masses, they cannot fully understand the complex and interconnected ideological situations among the masses, and naturally cannot lead the masses well.
    Does participating in production reduce the time spent on leadership work? Guan Musheng and the other cadres of Changfeng Cooperative's experience proves that because everyone participates in production and understands the situation, problems can be solved with a quick meeting, meetings have been reduced by more than half compared to the past, and all tasks have been done better. It is especially important to note that they do not simply participate in production for the sake of participating in production; they participate in production with a clear purpose: to deeply understand the problems in production and the opinions of cooperative members, and to improve leadership. Since the purpose is clear, and since the process of participating in production is the process of doing leadership work, they naturally do not feel that participating in production hinders leadership work.
    Cooperative cadres who participate in production must be in a certain production team. Therefore, some cooperative cadres, after participating in production, easily take over the affairs of the production team, replacing the duties of the production team leader. On the other hand, in agricultural cooperatives that have already implemented contracting production to teams or households, the cooperative director and management committee easily relax their leadership over the production teams. However, Guan Musheng did not fall into these two deviations in the process of participating in production and leading production. The problems he solved in the process of participating in production were major problems of the entire cooperative, or problems that the production team leader could not solve, or important problems that other cooperative cadres had neglected. He not only solved the individual problems of individual teams and individuals; he paid more attention to generalizing from the individual to the general, solving important problems related to the interests of the majority of people in the entire cooperative.
    Guan Musheng's leadership method was learned from inspecting the work of two production team leaders; after he realized it, he conscientiously practiced it and became an example for other cadres in the cooperative, naturally causing other cadres to learn this good working method. This is precisely "from the masses, to the masses," and it is also using oneself as a typical example to demonstrate to other cadres. This approach itself is a good working method. Not only should leaders of the masses pay attention to working methods, but higher-level cadres leading lower-level cadres must also pay close attention to working methods – first and foremost, using good working methods to teach lower-level cadres to learn good working methods. When the Fourth Production Team of Changfeng Agricultural Cooperative failed to complete its fertilizer accumulation task, the management committee suspected that the production team leader's ability was weak and replaced him; facts proved that this was definitely not a good way to truly solve the problem. Under normal circumstances, when problems arise in work, the first thing to consider should be how to help the directly responsible cadres understand how they should improve their work, rather than simply replacing and reprimanding them.
    Guan Musheng's use of participating in production methods to lead production was not without difficulties, and was not without struggles. The first difficulty he encountered was having many concurrent positions and many meetings. He struggled in the gaps between meetings, squeezing out time to participate in production. It may not be possible to completely eliminate concurrent positions, but in order to ensure that cooperative cadres have sufficient time to go deep into the fields to participate in production and lead production, and in order to prevent cooperative cadres from affecting their health due to being too busy with work and production, higher-level leading organs should pay attention to reducing the concurrent positions and meetings of cooperative cadres as much as possible. This is a major issue related to whether cooperative cadres can use the correct methods to lead production, and it is also a major issue related to whether cooperatives can be run well and whether great harvests can be achieved.

    学习官木生的领导方法
    出席全国农业劳动模范代表会议的代表、湖北省孝感县长风农业社主任官木生把参加生产劳动作为深入群众的领导方法，解决了整个农业合作社生产领导方面的许多问题。他的这种领导方法是值得加以推广的。
    在农业合作化全面实现以后，各地农业生产合作社的干部们，对于怎样做领导工作感到有一些困难问题没有解决。
    有这样一些农业社干部，他们受社员委托担任了领导职务以后，特别是办了规模比较大的高级社以后，就不再直接参加生产劳动了。他们之中，绝大多数也并不是好逸恶劳的人，而是觉得要办的事情太多，再要直接参加生产劳动就会忙不过来，就会妨害领导全社的大事。
    也有这样一些农业社干部，他们十分乐意参加社里的生产劳动。可是，他们这样做的目的主要是为自己多挣工分。他们埋头生产，干得很起劲，在一个队一个组里也能起带头作用，可是却放松了对全社工作的领导，甚至把社里的公事丢开不管。
    困难的问题就发生在这里：不直接参加生产吧，社员群众会有意见，说你是在做“甩手掌柜”；家里的人也会有意见，说你不照顾家庭生活。参加生产劳动吧，别的干部会说你只顾自己，当社干部是“挂空名”。许多社干部就在这“几头受气”的情况下苦闷着，不知如何是好。
    究竟应该怎么办？官木生用他的实际行动所创造的成功的经验回答了这个困难问题。这就给所有的农业社的干部们做出了很好的榜样。官木生经过认真的观察和思索，从实际工作当中体会出一条最好的工作方法就是“参加生产，领导生产”——既要参加生产，又要领导生产；只有参加生产，才能领导生产；参加生产的主要目的就是为了更好地领导生产。
    在一定的意义上，对社干部来说，脱离生产就是脱离群众。在农业社里，社员群众都是参加直接生产劳动的，他们每天的活动时间绝大部分是在直接的生产劳动中度过的。社干部不参加直接的生产劳动，自然而然就会脱离群众。脱离生产就不能直接了解生产活动中时刻变化的各种各样的具体情况，自然就不能很好地领导生产。脱离群众就不能充分了解群众中的复杂的互相关联的思想情况，自然就不能很好地领导群众。
    参加了生产是不是就会减少做领导工作的时间呢？官木生和长风社的其他干部的经验证明：由于大家都参加生产，了解情况，有事碰个头就能解决问题，会议比过去减少了一半多，各项工作反而做得更好了。在这里特别值得注意的是，他们不是单纯地为参加生产而参加生产，他们参加生产有明确的目的：深入地了解生产中的问题和社员们的意见，改进领导。既然目的很明确，既然参加生产的过程就是做领导工作的过程，他们自然也就不会感觉到参加生产会妨碍做领导工作了。
    社干部参加生产，总得在某一个生产队里。因此，有些社干部在参加生产之后，很容易包办生产队里的事情，代替生产队长的职务。另一方面，在已经实行了包工包产的农业社里，社主任和管理委员会又很容易放松对生产队的领导。可是，官木生在参加生产、领导生产的过程中，却没有发生这两种偏向。他在参加生产的过程中解决的问题是全社性的重大问题，或者是生产队长确实不能解决的问题，或者是别的社干部忽视了的重要问题。他不只是解决了个别队和个别人的个别问题；他更注意的是由个别推广到一般，解决了全社多数人利害相关的重要问题。
    官木生的领导方法是他从检查两个生产队长的工作当中领悟到的；他领悟到了以后就切实地身体力行，又成为社里别的干部的榜样，自然而然地使别的一些干部也学会了这种好的工作方法。这也正是“从群众中来，到群众中去”，也正是用自己作典型来对别的干部起示范作用。这种作法本身，就是一种好的工作方法。不只领导群众要注意工作方法，上级干部领导下级干部，也必须十分注意工作方法——首先是要用好的工作方法教下级干部学会好的工作方法。当长风农业社第四生产队积肥任务完不成的时候，管理委员会曾怀疑生产队长的能力不强，把他撤换了；事实证明，这决不是真正解决问题的好办法。在一般情况下，在工作中发生了问题的时候，首先应该考虑的是如何帮助直接负责的干部了解他应该怎样改进工作，而不应该是简单地加以撤换和申斥。
    官木生用参加生产的方法来领导生产，不是没有碰到过困难的，不是没有经历过斗争的。他首先碰到的困难是兼职多、会议多。他是在会议的夹缝中间斗争，硬挤出时间来参加生产的。完全不兼职也许做不到，但是，为了保证社干部有充分的时间深入田间去参加生产、领导生产，为了使社干部不致因工作和生产太忙而影响健康，上级领导机关应该注意尽量减少社干部的兼职和会议。这是关系到社干部能不能用正确的方法领导生产的一个大问题，也是能不能办好合作社、能不能取得大丰收的一个大问题。
