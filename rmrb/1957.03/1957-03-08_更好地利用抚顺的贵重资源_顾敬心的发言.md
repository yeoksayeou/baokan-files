Chairman, fellow committee members, ladies and gentlemen:

I completely agree with and support the reports of Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and other leaders.

I am a synthetic petroleum worker and have been engaged in oil shale retorting and shale oil processing in Fushun since the founding of the People's Republic of China. Therefore, I have a relatively good understanding of the industrial situation in Fushun, one of the current fuel industrial bases, and I have deeper insights. I would like to put forward two immature personal opinions, hoping that in the course of socialist construction and national industrialization, combined with the basic spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, Fushun's valuable resources, coal and oil shale, can be better utilized and developed more rapidly.

	First, realize the comprehensive utilization of Fushun bituminous coal as soon as possible.

The burning of Fushun bituminous coal without recovering liquid fuels, coal gas, and chemical raw materials should no longer be allowed. The comprehensive utilization of Fushun bituminous coal for thermal energy, electrical energy, liquid fuels, city gas, chemical raw materials, etc. should be considered.

Fushun is one of the famous coal-producing bases in China. Everyone knows that the output is large and the quality is good. Unfortunately, such a large amount of good bituminous coal, except for a very small part used as coking raw material, is mostly used for thermal energy and burned directly. The valuable liquid fuels and chemical products in the bituminous coal have not been extracted in advance. From the perspective of national economic development and full utilization of existing resources, this is extremely inappropriate.

	If all the oil in Fushun bituminous coal is extracted, it will be more than the oil in Yumen.

According to industrial analysis, Fushun bituminous coal contains more than 40% volatile matter, about 13% tar, about 10% ash, less than 0.7% sulfur, about 8% moisture, and a calorific value of about 8,000 kilocalories per kilogram. Industrialized tests have proven that it is very suitable for low-temperature carbonization, which can extract liquid fuels and a series of chemical products. Soviet synthetic petroleum expert Comrade Alexandrov said: If all the oil in Fushun bituminous coal is extracted well, it will be more than the oil in Gansu's Yumen. Czechoslovakian synthetic petroleum expert Comrade Malay said: The chemical raw materials in Fushun bituminous coal should not be burned, but should be extracted completely, so that Chinese women can wear nylon stockings. Because bituminous coal is not only a source of thermal energy, but also a source of liquid fuels, plastics, and a series of valuable chemical raw materials. Therefore, the comprehensive utilization of Fushun bituminous coal should be considered, so that such good resources can play a greater role.

Because Germany lacked petroleum and chemical raw material resources, there is a joint enterprise that comprehensively utilizes lignite in the Bielen area, with a low-temperature carbonization plant that processes 6,500 tons of lignite per day and night, a processing plant that produces 250,000 tons of synthetic petroleum per year, a high-pressure gasification plant that produces 160 million cubic meters of coal gas per year, a phenol extraction plant that produces 15,000 tons of phenols per year, a recovery plant that produces 10,000 tons of sulfur per year, a power generation capacity of 250,000 kilowatts, and a thermal power station that supplies 1,500 tons of steam per day. There is also a second joint enterprise in the Wensipinghan area, with a low-temperature carbonization plant that processes 7,500 tons of lignite per day and night and its tar processing plant, and a power plant with a power generation capacity of 310,000 kilowatts. During World War II, the United Kingdom also attached great importance to the comprehensive utilization of coal and heatedly discussed in the literature: "The problem of not allowing the burning of bituminous coal without recovering chemical products." Recently, the Soviet Union also believes that the comprehensive utilization of coal has broad development prospects. Modern large-scale thermal power stations will not only be the central source of electrical energy and thermal energy for the national economy, but should also undertake the responsibility of supplying liquid fuels, coal gas, and chemical raw materials for the national economy.

It is known that in order to meet the needs of industrial development and electrical and thermal energy, the Fushun area will soon build power stations of hundreds of thousands of kilowatts and large thermal power stations. Together with the existing power plants, about five million tons of coal will be used annually in the near future. This is a very large amount. We do not allow such good Fushun bituminous coal to be burned directly. We must make good comprehensive use of it, because if five million tons of Fushun bituminous coal are first processed by low-temperature carbonization, about 430,000 tons of liquid fuel, 300 million cubic meters of city gas, about 21,000 tons of phenols, 30,000 tons of ammonium sulfate, and 3 million tons of semi-coke can be obtained. If the semi-coke is all used as fuel for steam boilers in power stations, it can generate about 5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity.

Also, phenol is one of the main raw materials for plastics. Various countries in the world produced 85,000 tons of various plastics in 1929, and 3 million tons in 1955. In addition to household utensils, they can also be used to make parts for electrical appliances, radios, airplanes, automobiles, etc. The Soviet Union has a plastic called "miraculous sand" that can filter seawater and turn it into fresh water.

If the Fushun area urgently needs to build power stations and thermal power stations, it should also consider building a coal low-temperature carbonization plant at the same time. We do not allow the burning of Fushun bituminous coal without recovering liquid fuels, coal gas, and chemical raw materials. It is hoped that the leaders of the State Planning Commission and the coal, petroleum, electric power, and chemical industries departments, as well as relevant scientific workers, will jointly study and realize the comprehensive utilization of Fushun bituminous coal as soon as possible.

	Second, the Fushun shale oil industry should be actively developed.

Fushun's shale oil industry is currently the world's largest production area. Before our country's natural petroleum can be produced in large quantities, we should use all favorable conditions to improve synthetic petroleum technology and give full play to the capacity of existing equipment to achieve the goal of expanding production. However, since liberation, although the synthetic petroleum industry has made certain achievements, the output of shale oil has increased tenfold compared with the time of liberation, and the utilization rate of shale has also been continuously improved. At the same time, efforts have been made to utilize shale with low oil content, and losses have been reduced as much as possible to produce more oil. However, due to the lack of attention to the synthetic petroleum industry from the leadership, it has not been able to achieve the ideal greater development. Fushun is generally only regarded as a coal capital, and it has not been realized that Fushun is an outstanding synthetic petroleum base in the world, because the shale is on top of the coal, which is very suitable for large-scale open-pit mining. We should actively develop the shale oil industry even more.

	Fuel refined from shale oil is of excellent quality and can be used for airplanes and engines.

In the past, it was generally believed that shale oil could not produce aviation fuel and higher-quality engine fuel after processing. This technical shortcoming that has not been caught up, coupled with certain economic factors, has made many people who do not conduct in-depth research hold a skeptical attitude, which has limited the rapid development of shale oil. But the facts have proved that the products currently hydrorefined from shale oil all meet the requirements of aviation fuel and high-quality engine fuel. At the same time, the US government has recently spent several hundred million US dollars to study shale retorting and shale oil refining. The conclusion is that the shale processing industry consumes the least amount of metal compared to natural petroleum and other synthetic petroleum industries, and the exploration of shale mining areas is simpler and more reliable than petroleum exploration. From an economic value perspective, the cost of each barrel of shale oil is 1.8 US dollars, natural petroleum is 1.5 US dollars, the gasoline processed from each gallon of shale oil is 0.147 US dollars, and the gasoline processed from natural petroleum is 0.12-0.13 US dollars, with a difference of only 15%-20%. If the favorable conditions of regional distribution are taken into account, plus the transportation price difference, the price of shale oil products can be reduced a lot. Therefore, the US Petroleum Committee believes that the low-temperature carbonization of shale is a good way to meet petroleum consumption at present and in the future. In the Soviet Union, the shale processing industry is a comprehensive production. It mainly produces high-calorific value gas for residents and industry, and also produces shale oil, cement, and fertilizer. The shale in Estonia and Leningrad has become the base for gas and chemical raw materials in the region and the entire Baltic coast, and great achievements have been made in the development of the shale processing industry. Countries like the Soviet Union and the United States with abundant natural petroleum are still actively trying to develop the shale oil industry, so we should develop rapidly on the existing foundation. In particular, Fushun's shale oil industry can also obtain a large number of by-products ammonium sulfate, which everyone knows is an extremely important agricultural fertilizer.

	Accelerate the exploitation and expansion of the East and West Open-Pit Mines to make Fushun an important shale oil industrial base.

Over the past seven years, the Fushun shale oil industry has created a lot of wealth for the country and has played a certain role in economic construction and petroleum supply. Like the people of the whole country, Fushun shale oil workers feel honored and happy for the development of the Fushun shale oil industry and are dedicating all their strength to the petroleum that is indispensable in the country's economic construction, completing and overfulfilling production tasks every year. Unfortunately, since the third quarter of 1956, due to insufficient shale supply, although a large amount of shale that had been abandoned for many years and had been partially weathered was used to supplement it, it still could not meet the shale supply needs of the No. 1 and No. 2 Petroleum Plants, and production had to be reduced, which affected the completion of the national plan. Since December 1956, the situation has become even worse. The No. 1 Petroleum Plant has completely stopped production of one set of retorting furnaces (a total of 26 units), but the source of shale still cannot meet the current production needs of the No. 1 and No. 2 Petroleum Plants. According to the survey, this situation will not only not improve this year, but also there is no hope that the shale supply will meet the existing production needs in 1958. At a time when the motherland urgently needs petroleum, the shale oil plant not only cannot give full play to its existing equipment capacity, but is shrinking production due to the lack of shale, which is extremely inappropriate.

The Fushun shale oil industry has an extremely important position both domestically and abroad, in the past, present, and future. It is hoped that the State Planning Commission can further consider accelerating the expansion of the Fushun West Open-Pit Mine and accelerating the exploitation of the East Open-Pit Mine, so that the Fushun shale oil industry can continue to develop, continue to move forward, and permanently become an important international shale oil industrial base.

Finally, I hope that all committee members and comrades will give me enthusiastic help and guidance. (Attached picture)

### 更好地利用抚顺的贵重资源  顾敬心的发言

专栏：

    更好地利用抚顺的贵重资源
    顾敬心的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位先生：
    我完全同意并且拥护毛主席、周总理和各位首长的报告。
    我是一个人造石油工作者，自中华人民共和国成立以来，一直在抚顺从事油母页岩干馏和页岩油加工工作。因而我对当前燃料工业基地之一的抚顺工业情况，比较了解得多点，体会得深些，谨提出两点不成熟的个人意见，希望在社会主义建设和国家工业化途中，结合增产节约的基本精神，使抚顺贵重的资源，煤和油母页岩，能够更好的利用，得到更快的发展。
      第一，早日实现抚顺烟煤的综合利用
    不允许再燃烧未经回收液体燃料，煤气和化学原料的抚顺烟煤。要考虑抚顺烟煤对热能，电能，液体燃料，城市煤气，化学原料等的综合利用。
    抚顺是国内著名的产煤基地之一，产量之多，质量之好，是大家知道的，可惜现在这样多而好的烟煤，除极少部分作为炼焦原料外，绝大部分作热能，直接燃烧掉了，未能预先将烟煤中宝贵的液体燃料和化学产品提炼出来，从国民经济发展和充分利用现有资源上看，都是极不应该的。
    抚顺烟煤中的油全部提炼出来，要比玉门的油还多
    抚顺烟煤，根据工业分析结果，含挥发分40％以上，焦油13％左右，灰分10％左右，硫分0.7％以下，水分8％左右，发热量约每公斤八千千卡。经过工业化试验鉴定，已证明很适合于进行低温干馏，可提炼液体燃料和一系列的化学产品。苏联人造石油专家亚历山大罗夫同志说：抚顺全部烟煤里的油，很好的提炼出来，要比甘肃玉门的油还多，捷克斯洛伐克人造石油专家马来同志说：抚顺烟煤中的化学原料不应烧掉，应该全部提出来，使中国妇女可以穿到玻璃丝袜。因为烟煤不仅是热能的来源，同时也是液体燃料，塑料及一系列有价值的化学原料的来源。所以抚顺烟煤应该考虑综合利用，使这样好的资源，能更大的发挥作用。
    德国因为缺乏石油和化学原料的资源，在标连地方有一个综合利用褐煤的联合企业，有一昼夜处理六千五百吨褐煤的低温干馏工厂，年产二十五万吨人造石油的加工工厂，年产一万六千万立方公尺煤气的高压气化工厂，年产一万五千吨酚类的抽酚工厂，年产一万吨硫黄的回收工厂，发电能力二十五万瓩和每天供蒸气一千五百吨的热电站。又在文思平汉地方有第二个联合企业，每昼夜处理七千五百吨褐煤的低温干馏厂及其焦油加工厂，发电能力三十一万瓩的发电站。在第二次世界大战时，英国也极重视煤的综合利用，在文献上热烈讨论：“关于不许燃烧未回收化学产品的沥青煤问题”。最近苏联对煤的综合利用，亦认为有广阔的发展远景，现代巨大的热电站，将不仅是供给国民经济上电能和热能的中心泉源，而应同时担负起国民经济上供给液体燃料、煤气和化学原料的责任。
    据知抚顺地区为了满足工业发展和电能热能的需要，即将新建几十万瓩的发电站和很大的热电站，再加上现有的电厂，最近将来每年用煤约五百万吨，这是一个很大的数量，我们不允许把这样好的抚顺烟煤直接燃烧掉，我们一定要很好的综合利用起来，因为五百万吨抚顺烟煤，如果先经低温干馏处理，便可得液体燃料约四十三万吨，城市煤气三万万立方公尺，酚类约二万一千吨，硫酸氨三万吨，半焦约三百万吨，如将半焦全部作为发电站的蒸气锅炉燃料，则可发电能约五十亿瓩时。
    还有酚是塑料的主要原料之一，世界各国1929年产各种塑料八万五千吨，1955年已产三百万吨，除家常用具外，还可做电气，无线电，飞机，汽车等的零件，苏联有一种塑料“奇妙的沙子”能把海水过滤后变成淡水。
    抚顺地区倘若迫切急需建设发电站和热电站，就应同时考虑建设煤的低温干馏工厂。我们不允许再燃烧未经回收液体燃料、煤气和化学原料的抚顺烟煤。希望国家计划委员会及煤炭、石油、电力、化学工业部的领导和有关科学工作者，共同研究，早日实现抚顺烟煤的综合利用。
    第二，应该积极发展抚顺页岩油工业
    抚顺的页岩油工业是目前世界上最大的一个产地。在我国天然石油还未能大量生产之前，我们应该利用一切有利条件，改进人造石油的技术，发挥现有设备能力，以达到扩大产量的目的。可是在解放以后人造石油工业方面，虽然有了一定的成就，页岩油产量比解放时已提高了十倍，页岩利用率也有了不断的提高。同时对含油量低的页岩设法利用，尽量作到减少损失多出油。然而由于领导上对人造石油工业的重视不够，还没有能够达到理想的更大的发展。抚顺，一般只以为是煤都，而没有认识到抚顺是世界上特出的人造石油基地，因为煤的上层即为页岩，极适合于大规模露天开采。我们更应该积极的发展页岩油工业。
    从页岩油精制出来的燃料质量优良可供飞机和发动机之用
    过去一般认为页岩油加工后不能生产航空燃料及质量较高的发动机燃料，这种技术上没有迎头赶上的缺点，再加上某些经济因素，使很多不深入研究的人，抱着怀疑的态度，就限制了页岩油的迅速发展。但事实证明，现在从页岩油加氢精制出来的产品，已全部合于航空燃料和品质优良的发动机燃料要求。同时美国政府近来花了几亿美元研究页岩干馏和页岩油精制，得出的结论为：页岩加工工业比天然石油和其他人造石油工业，所消耗的金属为最少，页岩矿区的勘探比石油勘探要简单而可靠得多。从经济价值来看，每桶页岩油成本为一点八美元，天然石油为一点五美元，每加仑页岩油加工的汽油为零点一四七美元，天燃石油加工的汽油为零点一二—零点一三美元，差额仅15％—20％。如考虑地区分布的有利条件，再加上运输差价，则页岩油产品价格还可降低很多。所以美国石油委员会认为页岩的低温干馏是目前和将来满足石油消耗的良好途径。在苏联，页岩加工工业是一种综合生产。主要是生产居民和工业用的高热值煤气，同时也生产页岩油、水泥和肥料。爱沙尼亚和列宁格勒的页岩，已是该地区及全部波罗的海沿岸的煤气及化学原料的基地，在页岩加工工业的发展道路上，已获得了很大的成就。像苏联和美国这样天然石油多的国家还在积极想发展页岩油工业，所以我们更应该从已有的基础上迅速发展。尤其抚顺页岩油工业还可得到大量的副产品硫酸氨，大家知道是极重要的农业肥料。
    加速开采和扩建东西露天矿，使抚顺成为一个重要的页岩油工业基地
    抚顺页岩油工业，七年来已为国家创造了很多财富，在经济建设石油供应上起了一定的作用，抚顺页岩油工作者同全国人民一样，为了抚顺页岩油工业的发展，感到光荣和高兴，为了国家经济建设中必不可少的石油而献出一切力量，每年完成和超额完成生产任务。可惜自1956年第三季度起，由于页岩供应不足，虽然把过去舍弃多年已经局部风化了的页岩来大量补充，然还是不能满足石油一厂和二厂页岩供应的需要，不得不被迫减少生产，影响了国家计划的完成。自1956年12月起，情况更为恶劣，石油一厂将一组干馏炉（共二十六台）全部停止生产，但页岩来源仍不能满足石油一、二厂目前生产的需要。据调查这样情况，不但今年不会好转，连1958年亦没有希望页岩供应得以满足现有的生产需要。在今天祖国正急需石油的时候，页岩油工厂非但不能发挥现有的设备能力，反而因缺乏页岩而萎缩生产，这是极不应该的。
    抚顺页岩油工业不论在国内和国外，在过去、现在和将来，都有它极重要的地位。希望国家计划委员会能更进一步的考虑抚顺西露天矿的加速扩建，东露天矿的加速开采，使抚顺页岩油工业继续发展，不断前进，永久成为国际上的重要页岩油工业基地。
    最后希望各位委员和各位同志给我以热情的帮助和指教。（附图片）
