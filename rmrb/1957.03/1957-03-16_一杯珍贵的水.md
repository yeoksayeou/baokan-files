    A Precious Cup of Water
    Lu Qiming

    One winter morning, the warship was anchored in a harbor.

    I woke up to find it already bright. I was about to get up when the warship suddenly tilted sharply to the left, slamming me against the iron wall. Then came the whistling of the wind and the roar of the waves. At that moment, I heard the crisp, cheerful voice of the communications soldier, Xiao Liang:

    "Report to the Captain, it's time to wash your face."

    I half-lay and turned my head to see Commander Kong already out of bed. He was buttoning the lowest button of his uniform as he turned around. Commander Kong stood motionless in front of Xiao Liang, his back to me. From Xiao Liang's uneasy gaze, I could tell that Commander Kong was somewhat displeased with him.

    "Xiao Liang, what you did was wrong. Haven't I already announced that we must conserve fresh water? Why did you scoop out so much?" Commander Kong said gently. "Take the water in the basin back and just scoop out a cup." I was curious. I got out of bed and saw that the basin contained no more than two cups of water. In the office, this amount of water wouldn't be considered much for washing one's face. In a little while, Xiao Liang came back from outside with a cup of water. Commander Kong just reached out to take it, then suddenly pulled back his hand. He shook his head, frowned, raised his voice, and said sternly: "Why use such a big cup?"

    "You're the Captain. You can't be egalitarian with the soldiers. What's wrong with using a little more!" Xiao Liang replied softly, but with resentment.

    "That won't do. Precisely because I am the Captain, I must take the lead in implementing the decision!" Saying that, Commander Kong handed him a cup, suppressing a smile, and said: "Next time you do this, watch out for your backside!" This cup was only half an inch shorter than the one in Xiao Liang's hand, but Commander Kong made things difficult for Xiao Liang just to use a little less water.

    The water in the cup was two or three tenths of an inch from the edge of the cup. When Commander Kong took the cup from Xiao Liang, he seemed very careful; he bent slightly, held it with both hands, and slowly walked to wash his face. He didn't pour the water out, but put the cup into the basin along with the water. He didn't rinse his mouth before brushing his teeth, but just slightly moistened the toothbrush in the water. After brushing his teeth, he didn't spit that small mouthful of water into the sink, but into the basin. I thought: was it to avoid dirtying the sink? That didn't make sense, the sink was meant for washing. Commander Kong's face-washing was even more ingenious. He held the towel in his left hand and slowly poured the water from the cup onto the towel with his right hand. When the towel was damp, he lightly wrung it out and wiped his face, then wrung it out again and wiped again. After washing, he wrung it out again, using such force that not a single drop of water could be squeezed out before he let go. But he didn't unfold the towel and hang it on the rack, but put it in the sink. At this time, I noticed that the originally white towel had turned yellowish-black. There were also gray-black spots on Commander Kong's cheeks.

    During the day, the warship patrolled at sea all day. At night, it anchored overnight in another harbor. Forty minutes before bedtime, I walked from the aft deck to the Captain's cabin. Near the kitchen, I saw Xiao Liang scooping water from a large iron bucket. I walked over, lowered my head, and saw that the water in the bucket was yellowish. The water in the small iron bucket on the left was even more turbid. I asked what such dirty water was for. Xiao Liang said: "To wash the Captain's feet." After speaking, Xiao Liang hurried away. I was puzzled, why didn't they use a water pump to draw clean water? Why were they all so precious about water!

    Bedtime was approaching, I walked into the Captain's cabin. At this time, the Captain had just washed his feet and was wiping the water from his calves with his hands. The water dripped along the edge of the basin and collected in the center of the basin. At this time, the water in the basin had turned gray-black. The foot cloth was dry, and the water on his feet was wiped again and again. Finally, he squeezed the foot cloth twice with force. I couldn't help but ask: "Why, did you bring too little water when you set sail?"

    "No, our water tanks were full when we set sail." Commander Kong put on his shoes, stood up, smiled, and turned to me: "Let's go, let's take a stroll on the deck before going back to sleep."

    I remembered that Commander Kong had been commanding on the bridge all day and hadn't rested yet! We walked to the foredeck. At this time, the bright moon shone on the sea, and the light from the sea reflected onto the deck, making the deck shine.

    "You probably already know from the Headquarters that our ship should have returned to base long ago. But just as we were preparing to return, we received a telegram from the Commander. The telegram said that the government had a batch of ships loaded with construction materials passing through our sea area, and intelligence suggested that the enemy had discovered them. The Commander asked us if we could extend our guard duty for ten days. I told everyone about this situation, and, wow, you should have heard the reaction, it immediately exploded: 'Such a good thing, the Commander doesn't even need to ask for our opinion, just give the order!' 'We can't hand this task over to someone else!'
  'We will never go back to see the Commander until we complete this task!' But, again, people need to drink water, and machines also need water. How could the remaining water be enough for ten days! So the political commissar and I launched a discussion among the sailors about 'solving the freshwater problem'. Everyone agreed: 'Let the machines have the freshwater!' So, based on the sailors' suggestions, I announced the rule of one cup of water per person per day: The water used for washing faces and rinsing mouths is collected in a large iron bucket. After it settles, it is used to wash feet. The water used to wash feet is then collected in another bucket and used to wash and scrub the deck the next day. We lived like this for a week, and we estimate that it will take another four days to return..."

    Unconsciously, I followed Commander Kong to the vicinity of the kitchen. Suddenly, he stopped and walked towards the two iron buckets. He looked at the water in the buckets, ran his hand through his hair, smiled, and walked towards the Captain's cabin.

    一杯珍贵的水
    陆其明
    一个冬天的早晨，军舰停泊在一个港湾里。
    一觉醒来，天已大亮。正要起床，军舰猛地向左一倾，把我撞到铁壁上，接着传进来风的呼啸声，浪的怒吼声。这时，我听到通讯员小梁清脆快乐的声音：
    “报告舰长，请洗脸。”
    我半躺着侧过头来，只见孔舰长已下床。他一面扣着军装最下面的一个钮子，一面转过身去。孔舰长背朝着我，一动不动地站在小梁面前。从小梁的不安的目光中，看出孔舰长对他有些不高兴。
    “小梁，你这样做是不对的，我不是早已宣布过一定要节省用淡水，怎么还舀这么多水？”孔舰长温和地说。“脸盆里的水拿回去，舀一杯子水来就行了。”我有些好奇，下床一看，那脸盆里的水总共不过两杯，要是在机关里，洗脸用这点水并算不了什么。不一会，小梁从外边端了一杯水来，孔舰长刚伸过手去接，突然又缩了回来。只见他摇了摇头，皱了皱眉头，提高了声音，严肃地说：“怎么用这么大的杯子？”
    “你是舰长，不能和战士平均主义，多用一点儿有什么关系！”小梁低声而不服气地回答。
    “那还行，正因为我是舰长，更要带头执行决定！”说着，孔舰长递给他一只杯子，忍着笑，说：“下次再这样可当心你的屁股！”这个杯子仅仅比小梁手里的杯子矮半寸，但是，孔舰长就是为少用这一点水弄得小梁很为难。
    杯里的水离杯子的边沿还有两、三分，当孔舰长从小梁手里接过杯子的时候，看来他很小心；他微弯着腰，两手捧着，慢慢地走去洗脸。他并不将水倒出来，而是连杯子一起放在脸盆里。他刷牙前不漱口，只用牙刷在水里稍微润了润。刷好牙，他漱的那一小口水也并不向身边的洗脸池里吐，而是吐在脸盆里。我在想：是为了不沾脏洗脸池吗？不合情理，洗脸池就是为洗脸用的。孔舰长洗脸时更妙，左手拿着毛巾，右手慢慢地端起杯子里的水往毛巾上倒。毛巾潮湿了，轻轻绞一下，在脸上擦着，然后再绞一次，再擦着。洗好以后，又绞了一下，他是那样用劲，直到一滴水也挤不出来了才松手。可是他并不展开毛巾挂在架子上，而放在洗脸池内。这时候，我才注意到原来是白色的毛巾已经变得黄里泛黑了。孔舰长的两颊也有灰黑色的斑点。
    白天，军舰在海上巡逻了一天，晚上，在另一个港湾里停泊过夜。在就寝前四十分钟，我从后甲板向舰长室走去。走到厨房附近，看见小梁在一个大铁桶里舀水，我走过去，低下头一看，桶里的水是黄澄澄的。左面小铁桶里的水更浑浊。我问舀这样脏的水作什么用，小梁说：“给舰长洗脚。”说完，小梁已急匆匆地走掉了。我纳闷，他们为什么不用抽水机抽干净水用，为什么都对水这样珍贵！
    就寝时间快到了，我走进舰长室，这时舰长刚洗好脚，正在用手抹着沾在小腿上的水。水一滴一滴地沿着盆边汇集到盆心。这时盆里的水已变成灰黑色的了。脚布是干的，脚上的水也抹了一次又一次，最后又使劲将脚布绞了两次。我忍不住问道：“怎么，你们出航时水带少了吗？”
    “不，出航时我们水柜里装得满满的。”孔舰长穿好鞋，站起身，微笑着，转身叫我：“走，到甲板上去遛会儿再回来睡。”
    我想起来了，孔舰长在指挥台上指挥了一天，还没有休息过哩！我们走到前甲板，这时，皎洁的月亮照着海面，海面的亮光反射到甲板上，甲板也映得闪闪发光。
    “你大概已经从司令部知道，我们的舰早就该回基地了。可是当我们正要准备返航，接到司令员拍来的电报。电报说政府有一批满载建筑物资的船只从我们这个海区经过，据情报已被敌人发觉。司令员问我们能否延长十天时间担任警戒。我把这个情况向大伙一讲，吓，你说怎么着，马上就轰起来了：‘这样的好事，司令员还用得着征求我们的意见，下命令就得啦！’‘说什么也不能把这个任务交给别人！’
  ‘我们不完成这个任务决不回去见司令员！’但是，话又得说回来，人要吃水，机器也要喝水，所剩下的水十天怎够用！于是我和政委就发动水兵们开展‘关于解决淡水问题’的讨论。大伙一致意见是：‘把淡水让给机器！’这样我就根据水兵们的建议宣布每人每天用一杯水的规定：洗脸漱口过的水，都集中在一个大铁桶里，澄清后用来洗脚，洗过脚的水再汇集在另一个桶里，第二天用来洗擦甲板。省下来的水供给机器用。就这样我们生活了一个星期，估计还得四天才能返航……”
    不知不觉，我跟着孔舰长来到了厨房附近，忽然他停了脚步，向两个铁桶走去，他看了看桶里的水，用手理了理头发，微笑着向舰长室走去。
