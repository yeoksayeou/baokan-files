    New Developments in the Agricultural Cooperativization Movement in People's Democratic Countries
    ·Korea·
    Last year, the income of cooperative members greatly increased
    According to statistics from the Korean Ministry of Agriculture, the average household in agricultural production cooperatives in northern Korea received more than 1,540 kilograms of grain and 9,400 Korean won last year. Compared with 1955, each household's grain income increased by 41%, and cash income increased by 69%. Many households that previously lacked grain are now surplus grain households.
    ·Poland·
    Cooperative mutual aid organizations are being rebuilt everywhere
    At present, more than 3,600 mutual aid and cooperative groups for agriculture, animal husbandry, and other fields, as well as a large number of agricultural cooperatives, have been formed across Poland based on the principle of voluntarism.
    In Lublin Province, 19 agricultural cooperatives have recently been formed. Nine of them were reorganized after being dissolved, and the other ten are completely newly established. In Zamość County in this province, seven agricultural cooperatives have been established in the past two months. In the past, local leaders considered it impossible to establish cooperatives in this county.
    ·Hungary·
    Nine hundred cooperatives have been restored
    According to the Hungarian "People's Freedom Daily" report, nearly 900 agricultural production cooperatives that were dissolved in the October events last year have been restored. Currently, there are more than 2,340 agricultural production cooperatives nationwide. Before October 15th last year, there were more than 3,950 agricultural production cooperatives nationwide.
    ·Albania·
    More than 500 cooperatives will be added this year
    In 1957, the number of agricultural cooperatives in Albania will increase to 1,400. In 1957, the state's long-term loans to agricultural cooperatives will reach 430 million leks (Albanian currency), an increase of 18% compared to last year.
    1956 was an important turning point in the development of Albania's agricultural cooperativization movement. The plan set by the Central Committee of the Labor Party in its December 1955 plenary session to double the number of cooperatives in one year has been overfulfilled. By the end of 1956, the number of agricultural cooperatives had increased to 881, with member farmers accounting for 24.3% of the total number of farmers and cultivated land area accounting for 30.8% of the total cultivated land area.

    人民民主国家农业合作化运动的新发展
    ·朝鲜·
    去年社员收入大大增加
    据朝鲜农业省统计，去年朝鲜北部各农业生产合作社的每个农户平均可分得粮食一千五百四十多公斤和朝币九千四百多元。同1955年相比，每户的粮食收入增加了41％，现款收入增加了69％。许多过去的缺粮户现在变成了余粮户。
    ·波兰·
    各地纷纷重建合作互助组织
    目前波兰全国已经根据自愿原则组成了三千六百多个农业、畜牧业等各种互助合作小组和大批农业合作社。
    在卢布林省，最近又组成了十九个农业合作社。其中九个是解散后重新组织起来的，其他十个是完全新成立的。在这个省的扎莫希戚县，最近两个月来共成立了七个农业合作社。过去，这个县被当地领导上认为是不可能建立合作社的。
    ·匈牙利·
    九百个合作社已经恢复
    据匈牙利“人民自由报”报道，匈牙利有将近九百个在去年十月事件中解散的农业生产合作社已经恢复。目前全国有二千三百四十多个农业生产合作社，在去年10月15日以前，全国有三千九百五十多个农业生产合作社。
    ·阿尔巴尼亚·
    今年将增加五百多个合作社
    1957年，阿尔巴尼亚农业合作社的数目将增加到一千四百个。1957年国家供给农业合作社的长期贷款将达四亿三千万列克（阿币），即比去年增加18％。
    1956年是阿尔巴尼亚农业合作化运动发展中的一个重要转折点。劳动党中央1955年12月全会所规定的在一年中把合作社的数目增加一倍的计划，已经超额完成。1956年底，农业合作社的数目增加到八百八十一个，入社农户占农户总数的24.3％，耕地面积占总耕地面积的30.8％。 （据新华社讯）
