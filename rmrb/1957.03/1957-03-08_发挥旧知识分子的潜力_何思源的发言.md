At this third plenary session of the National Committee, I am very pleased to see that our united front has been further expanded and consolidated, and our socialist construction is advancing day by day.

I am a former military and political personnel, and also a former intellectual. In recent years, I have been engaged in people's cultural undertakings. I would like to address the conference on some issues related to former intellectuals and former military and political personnel, based on what I know.

	The Strengths of Old Intellectuals

We people have many shortcomings, but also many strengths. Generally speaking, we have a higher level of education and long-term life experience. We have personally experienced the darkness, reactionary rule, and brutality of the old society, as well as the oppression of imperialism. Some of us have rich knowledge and expertise in the cultural heritage of the motherland. Some have received long-term bourgeois education at home and abroad, and have studied idealist philosophy and science. Their journey to embrace the people and socialism has been through many tortuous paths. They have gained experience and learned lessons from failures, so they have a certain ability to criticize things, and can recognize right and wrong, and distinguish good from evil in the comparison between the old and the new. After ideological remolding since liberation, they have raised their awareness, understood Marxism-Leninism, and understood the laws of social development, and bravely embarked on the bright road of socialism. Today, they are wholeheartedly taking this path and are willing to contribute everything they have to socialist construction.

	They are Serving Socialist Construction

On the other hand, the Communist Party and the government have not regarded them as burdens, nor have they discriminated against them. They have been assigned appropriate jobs so that they can make the best use of their talents. Some have even taken on leadership roles, and they are all competent and happy. If we count the proportion of former intellectuals and former military and political personnel in the central or local government, agencies, enterprises, schools, army, and scientific research departments, as well as the work they are doing, we can see the people's trust in them and the role they are playing in socialist construction.

However, I believe that there are still some problems among the old intellectuals and former military and political personnel, so their potential has not been fully exploited. Some people hold a mentality of seeking no merit but avoiding mistakes, and taking a laissez-faire attitude. They lack initiative and enthusiasm, and have not established a sense of ownership. They have not actively tried to give full play to their expertise. Some people understand the job arrangement as care, and understand the care as the favor of the Communist Party, and there is a mentality of being a guest. Of course, the reasons for these phenomena are multifaceted, including objective reasons and subjective reasons. How to eliminate these objective and subjective reasons needs to be studied. I think that as long as their enthusiasm is improved, they can play a greater role.

	An Example of Potential to be Exploited

Here, I would like to give an example to illustrate that if they have a clear understanding and receive appropriate help, there is potential to be exploited. Recently, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang organized a foreign language research group among its members and people from the society in order to cooperate with the march towards science, so that everyone can contribute their strength. There are one hundred and several dozens of people who participated with considerable knowledge of Russian, English, French, German, Japanese, Spanish, and other languages, many of whom are elderly people in their sixties and seventies. The French group, in view of the fact that there is no French-Chinese dictionary in the country (except for a small one from decades ago), plans to compile the book in their spare time within two years, and appointed Mr. Weng Wenhao, 69, to preside over this work. After this initiative, major cities across the country, such as Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, and other places have responded. This is just one of their tasks. This example shows that awakened former personnel can actively exert their potential strength bit by bit. These people are valuable assets of the country. Now they should be mobilized to quickly take out their treasures and contribute to the socialist construction.

The Intellectuals in Taiwan are also Valuable Assets of the Country

Here I would like to talk about the military and political personnel and intellectuals in Taiwan. They also have rich life experience and a high level of education. In the years since they left the motherland, they have suffered the pain of wandering. In many aspects, they may have a deeper understanding. They have suffered from imperialist oppression for more years than we have, and will love their motherland even more. They may be able to exert more strength on the front lines of opposing imperialism than we can. There is a Chinese saying: "A prodigal son returning home is more precious than gold." I think this makes sense. They are also the wealth of the country, and we will never give up this part of the wealth.

However, in Taiwan, some people may think that the care for former military and political personnel on the mainland may be because Taiwan has not been liberated, and these people are being used as examples, and the united front policy is just a means. Or they may think that it is too late to return to the motherland to participate in the revolution now, and they may not be forgiven and cared for. These ideas do not understand the principle of valuing people in socialist society, and do not understand that the united front policy is the basic policy of the Communist Party.

Speaking of care, of course, the Party and the government treat former personnel differently according to different specific circumstances. For example, those who are old and frail, weak and sick, and those with particularly heavy family burdens are taken care of in their lives, and they are taken care of very well. But the Communist Party regards these as its own responsibility, which is the responsibility placed on their shoulders by building socialism. The same is true for everyone, including Communist Party members. This is a concrete manifestation of the superiority of the socialist system. Of course, there are also some improper aspects in the specific arrangements for the care and work of former personnel, but these are only individual cases. The main aspect is to treat everyone as the wealth of the country, and the purpose is to unite all forces that can be united, and turn negative factors into positive factors. In the work of socialist construction, we are unwilling to leave out anyone. This is the basic principle of the united front policy. I think that if the former personnel in Taiwan can see clearly why the former personnel in the mainland are willing to exert their strength bit by bit, they will not have any worries.

All patriotic intellectuals, unite closely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and strive to improve the scientific and cultural level of our country and build a socialist society! (Attached picture)

### 发挥旧知识分子的潜力  何思源的发言

    发挥旧知识分子的潜力
    何思源的发言
    这次我们举行全国委员会第三次全体会议，我很高兴的看到，我们的统一战线更加扩大和巩固了，我们的社会主义建设事业日益向前发展了。
    我是旧军政人员，也是旧知识分子，这几年来，我从事人民文化事业，我想就我所知道的有关旧知识分子和旧军政人员的一些问题，向大会发言。
          旧知识分子的长处
    我们这些人有很多缺点，但是也有许多长处。一般来说都有较高的文化水平和长期的生活经验，对于旧社会的黑暗反动统治的残暴，帝国主义的压迫，都有过亲身的体会。其中有些人对于祖国的文化遗产，有丰富的知识和专长，有些人在国内外受过长期的资产阶级教育，研究过唯心主义哲学和科学。他们走向人民怀抱走向社会主义都是经过不少弯曲道路的，他们在失败中获得了经验，吸取了教训，因此对事物有一定的批判能力，能够在新旧的比较中认清是非，辨别善恶。解放后经过思想改造，他们提高了觉悟，认识了马克思列宁主义，认识了社会发展规律，而勇敢地走向社会主义的光明大道。今天，他们是全心全意地走这条道路，并且愿意对社会主义建设事业贡献自己的一切。
      他们正在为社会主义建设服务
    另一方面，共产党和政府也没有把他们看成包袱，没有歧视他们，分配给适当的工作，使他们能各尽所长，有的还担负领导工作，都胜任愉快。如果我们统计一下在中央或地方，无论在政府，机关，企业，学校，军队，科学研究部门，旧知识分子，旧军政人员所占的比重，所担任的工作，我们也就可以看出人民对于他们的信任，和他们在社会主义建设中所发挥的作用了。
    可是，我认为，在旧知识分子和旧军政人员方面，还存在着一些问题，因此他们的潜力还没有充分发挥出来。有些人抱着一种不求有功但求无过，得过且过的思想，主动性和积极性不够，主人翁思想还未建立起来，没有积极设法发挥自己专长。还有些人把工作安排，理解为照顾，把照顾又理解为共产党的恩惠，存在一种作客思想。当然产生这些现象的原因是多方面的，有客观的原因，也有主观的原因。如何消除这些客观与主观的原因希望加以研究，我想只要他们的积极性提高了，是能发挥更大的作用的。
        有潜力可以发挥的一例
    这里，我举一个例子来说明，如果他们认识清楚并得到适当的帮助时，是有潜力可以发挥的。近来，民革北京市委会就成员和社会人士中组织了一个外文研究组，以便配合向科学进军，使各人拿出自己的力量，参加的，对俄、英、法、德、日、西班牙等国文字有相当修养的一百几十人，有许多是六、七十岁的老人，其中的法文小组鉴于全国没有一本法汉字典
  （除了几十年前的一小本外），计划于二年内用业余时间编纂该书，并推定六十九岁高龄的翁文灏先生主持这个工作。经过这一提倡，全国各大城市，如天津、上海、南京、汉口等地都有了反映。这不过是他们工作中的一项。这个例子可以说明，觉悟了的旧人员是能够积极地发挥他们可以发挥的一点一滴的潜在力量的，这些人都是国家的宝贵财富。现在应当动员他们，赶紧把自己的宝贝都拿出来，贡献给社会主义建设事业。
  台湾的知识分子也是国家的宝贵财富
    这里我想顺便谈一谈，在台湾的军政人员和知识分子，他们也是具有丰富的生活经验及较高的文化水平的。在离开祖国这几年来他们已饱受流浪的痛苦，在许多方面可能体会得更深刻些，他们身受帝国主义压迫的年代，比我们多，将会更热爱自己的祖国，在反对帝国主义的战线上可能比我们更能发挥力量，中国有句俗语：“浪子回头，金不换”，我想这是有道理的。他们也是国家的财富，我们也绝不肯放弃这一部分财富。
    但是，在台湾，也许有人认为，对于大陆旧军政人员的照顾，可能是由于台湾没有解放，拿这些人作榜样，统战政策只是一个手段。或者认为现在回到祖国参加革命也晚了，不一定能得到原谅和照顾。这些想法都是不了解社会主义社会以人为贵的道理，不了解统战政策是共产党的基本政策。
    谈到照顾问题，当然，党和政府对旧人员，是按照不同的具体情况分别对待的，如对年老力衰的，体弱多病的，家庭负累特重的那些人在生活上是有照顾的，而且照顾得很周到。但是共产党把这些当作自己的责任，是建设社会主义所加在他们肩上的责任。对任何人都一样，即共产党员也不例外，这是社会主义制度优越性的具体表现之一。当然，对于旧人员的照顾和工作的具体安排方面，也还有不尽妥当的地方，但这只是个别的，主要方面，是把一切人都当作国家的财富，目的是在于团结一切可以团结的力量，变消极因素为积极因素。在社会主义建设的工作中不愿遗漏任何一个人，这就是统战政策的基本原则。我想如果在台湾的旧人员，都能看清楚为什么在大陆的旧人员愿意这样发挥自己一点一滴的力量，他们就不会有顾虑了。
    一切爱国的知识分子，紧密的团结起来，在中国共产党的领导下，为提高我国科学文化水平，为建设社会主义社会而奋斗！（附图片）
