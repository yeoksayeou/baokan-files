In the procurement of agricultural products, it is necessary to correctly implement the procurement policy, improve procurement methods, and promote the development of agricultural and sideline production; for the existing problems in the prices of agricultural and sideline products, under the principle of continuing to stabilize prices, they should be resolved quickly and gradually in accordance with the principle of benefiting the increase in agricultural and sideline production and ensuring the increase in grain production; it is necessary to do a good job in the allocation of procured materials, so that it is both conducive to the development of the national industrialization cause and takes into account the needs of the people's lives; in addition, it is also necessary to plan to expand the reserves of agricultural and sideline products and improve the level of operation and management. Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the market, further stabilize the market, and transform rural peddlers. In this regard, it is mainly necessary to strengthen the leadership and management of the free market, strengthen the political and ideological education of rural peddlers, transform their business ideas and business style, help them improve business management, and stop some small peddlers from engaging in speculative activities by using the opening of the free market. The staff of the supply and marketing cooperatives should also learn useful business experience and technology from rural peddlers. Third, vigorously carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, combine it with improving work, streamlining institutions and personnel; reasonably organize the circulation of commodities, especially change the current phenomenon of excessive business links, and reduce circulation costs; strengthen warehouse management and material storage, and reduce the rate of commodity loss; improve the labor organization of production and processing enterprises, improve labor productivity, and according to the raw materials and sales situation, give full play to the potential of existing equipment, increase production, improve product quality, and reduce costs. In the movement to increase production and practice economy, it is also necessary to overcome bureaucracy, reduce administrative expenses, and rationally use basic construction funds. In addition, in 1957, the supply and marketing cooperatives must also earnestly summarize the experience of commercial work and improve and strengthen the work of the grassroots cooperatives.
