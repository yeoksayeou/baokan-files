　　Appropriately Develop Small and Medium-Sized Industries
　　Liaoning to Build and Reconstruct Twenty-Two Factories and Mines
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Shenyang) This year, Liaoning Province will build and reconstruct twenty-two factories and mines in twenty-one counties including Faku, Kangping, Xinbin, and Fengcheng. These factories and mines will produce coal, iron ore, talc, boron ore, potassium chloride, hydrochloric acid, pulp, apple wine, and other products to satisfy people's livelihoods, support agricultural production, and state-owned enterprises. Among the twenty-two construction units, seven are small coal mines, distributed in Faku, Kangping, Jianchang, Beipiao, Lingyuan, Xifeng, and Kalaqin Left Banner. The coal mine in Faku, in addition to supplying fuel for local urban and rural areas, can also produce tens of thousands of tons of coke annually using local methods, ensuring the supply of coke needed by the local machinery industry and iron industry in Liaoning Province in the future. Among these newly built and reconstructed factories and mines, many are to support state-owned enterprises. The white clay powder produced by the Baitushan Mine in Yingkou County will supply seven paper mills and two pesticide factories in Andong, Jilin, and Mudanjiang. The Xinbin Iron Mine will supply Anshan Iron and Steel with tens of thousands of tons of iron ore this year. Borax, indispensable to the smelting industry, radio industry, and glass industry, used to be imported from abroad, but now a boron mine will be built in Fengcheng. The construction of these factories and mines has mostly begun, and it is expected that they will all be completed by the end of the year.

　　适当发展中小型工业
　　辽宁兴建和改建二十二个厂矿
    本报沈阳电　今年辽宁省将在法库、康平、新宾、凤城等二十一个县内，新建和改建二十二个工厂和矿山。这些工厂和矿山将生产煤炭、铁矿石、滑石、硼矿石、氯化钾、盐酸、纸浆、苹果酒等满足人民生活、支援农业生产和国营企业的产品。二十二个建设单位中，有七个是小型煤矿，它们分布在法库、康平、建昌、北票、凌源、西丰和喀喇沁左旗等地。法库的煤矿，除供应当地城乡烧火用外，每年还可用土法炼出数万吨焦炭，今后辽宁省地方机械工业和铁工工业所需用的焦炭供应，就有了保证。在新建和改建的这些厂矿中，有不少是为了支援国营企业的。营口县白土矿生产的白土粉，将供应安东、吉林、牡丹江等地七个造纸厂和两个农药厂的。新宾铁矿今年将以数万吨铁矿石来供应鞍钢。冶炼工业、无线电工业、玻璃工业所不可缺的硼砂，过去都是从国外进口的，现在凤城就要建成一个硼矿。这些工厂矿山的建立工程，大部已经动工，预计年末都能建成。
