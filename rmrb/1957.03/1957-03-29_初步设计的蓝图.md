　　Blueprint for Preliminary Design
　　(Our dispatch) The preliminary design of the Yellow River Sanmenxia Hydraulic Hub Project was completed in January of this year by the Leningrad Branch of the Soviet Hydroelectric Power Design Institute, commissioned by our country. The translated preliminary design documents have been sent to the Sanmenxia construction site. Currently, all employees of the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau are actively preparing for construction to welcome the commencement of the Sanmenxia Hydraulic Hub Project.
　　The preliminary design determines that the Yellow River Sanmenxia Hydraulic Hub is a comprehensive project. A concrete gravity dam over one hundred meters high will be used to cut off the Yellow River in the Sanmenxia Gorge, twenty-two kilometers downstream of Shan County, forming an inland sea—a reservoir—upstream. The inland sea can hold 64 billion cubic meters of water. By regulating the flow of the Yellow River with such a large reservoir, the once-in-a-thousand-year flood peak can be reduced from 35,000 cubic meters per second to 6,000 cubic meters per second, fundamentally eliminating the flood disasters that threaten the lives and property of 80 million people downstream. The minimum flow during the irrigation season can be increased from 360 cubic meters per second to 950 cubic meters per second, irrigating 40 million mu of farmland in Henan and other provinces. Its hydroelectric power station is currently the largest in the country. Once fully completed, the installed capacity will be 1.1 million kilowatts, with an annual power generation of 6 billion kilowatt-hours, which can guarantee the electricity needs for the construction of new industrial bases. Ships will first pass through the reservoir area, and navigation will also be developed within the 790-kilometer river section from Mangshan to Haikou due to the regulation of the reservoir.
　　The main projects of the Sanmenxia Hydraulic Hub are dam construction and hydroelectric power station installation. Due to the vast amount of work and the limitations of the Yellow River flood season and the narrow construction site, mechanized construction will be used for the entire project.

　　初步设计的蓝图
    本报讯  黄河三门峡水利枢纽工程的初步设计，已由受我国委托的苏联水力发电设计院列宁格勒分院在今年1月完成。译成中文的初步设计文件已经送到三门峡工地。现在三门峡工程局的全体职工正积极进行施工准备，迎接三门峡水利枢纽工程的开工。
    初步设计确定：黄河三门峡水利枢纽是一个综合性的工程。它将用一座百余公尺高的混凝土重力坝在陕县下游二十二公里处的三门峡峡谷里把黄河截断，使它的上游形成一个面积三千五百平方公里的内海——水库。内海可容水六百四十亿立公方。用这样大的一个水库调节黄河流量，可把千年一遇的洪峰，由三万五千秒公方减到六千秒公方，使威胁下游八千万人民生命财产的洪水灾害基本解除。可把灌溉季节的最低流量从三百六十秒公方提高到九百五十秒公方，使河南等省四千万亩农田得到灌溉。它的水电站是目前全国最大的，全部建成后装机容量为一百一十万瓩，年发电量为六十亿瓩小时，可以保证新的工业基地建设的用电。库区内将首先通行轮船，邙山到海口七百九十公里的河道内，由于水库的调节，航运也将得到发展。
    三门峡水利枢纽的主体工程是大坝堆筑和水电站安装。由于工程量浩大，受黄河汛期和施工场地狭窄的限制，整个工程将采用机械化施工。
