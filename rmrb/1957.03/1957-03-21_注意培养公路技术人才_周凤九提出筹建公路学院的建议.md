Pay Attention to Cultivating Highway Technical Personnel
Zhou Fengjiu Proposes Establishing a Highway Institute
    I wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao's instructions and Premier Zhou's report. I fully agree with the report made by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong.
    I am a highway worker, please allow me to reflect on some of the situations of highway engineering technicians here, and talk about personal opinions, please advise.
    A. Some Situations of Highway Engineering Technicians:
    1. In terms of work: In the years after liberation, highway engineering technicians, under the guidance and encouragement of the Party, left their footprints and contributed their labor on the vast land of the motherland. They braved various harsh climates and overcame hardships in life and work. They built the longest highway on the roof of the world and contributed their hard work to the southernmost part of the motherland. Over the past few years, they have gained certain education and training in their own professional practice.
    2. Regarding the issue of senior intellectuals: Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the report "On the Issue of Senior Intellectuals" last year, and announced the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" for literary and scientific workers, our comrades in the highway science and technology field, like intellectuals across the country, have been newly encouraged and feel the Party and the government's kind expectations and care for us, which has increased our sense of responsibility in our work. Before this, many of our highway engineering technicians only focused on working diligently, and were unwilling to boldly reflect opinions, harbored concerns, obeyed orders cautiously, and dared not contend. Now, many of us have changed and can do everything we know and say everything we know, but some people do not understand this policy enough. Therefore, this policy needs to be further implemented and democracy further promoted among our technical personnel, so that we can better contribute our strength to the country. Therefore, I wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao's new instructions on this policy.
    3. Learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union: In the past, our engineering technicians learned a set of things from capitalist countries. At first, they were somewhat resistant to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. After the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, the large-scale publication of translated Soviet books, and the application in practical work, they generally gained understanding and deeply realized the superiority of Soviet technology and the rationality of the Soviet system. This has led to a wave of enthusiasm for learning from the Soviet Union.
    However, in the past, due to our insufficient and superficial study of Soviet experience, individual mistakes of blindly applying and mechanically copying also occurred. I believe that learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union should not only specifically learn its scientific and technological content, but more importantly, grasp its spiritual essence and application methods. If this is ignored, it will lead to unrealistic dogmatism and lose its superior role. Since the Party Central Committee has repeatedly put forward instructions on overcoming dogmatism in work and put forward the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend, we have generally overcome the one-sidedness of learning from the Soviet Union. In the future, we must continue to work hard in this area, accept the advanced experience of other countries and our own on the principle of learning from the Soviet Union as the mainstay, oppose dogmatism, and do a good job in our highway construction.
    B. Personal Opinions:
    4. In addition, I would like to take this opportunity to reflect on a small opinion for the reference of the conference:
    The importance of the highway industry in national defense, national economy, and people's lives is familiar to all the members. Its scientific and technological nature is very high. The design and construction of pavements, bridges, etc., all have their technical complexity, but there is a great lack of existing highway technicians. In 1956, the general quality of local roads across the country was not high due to the lack of technical guidance. Therefore, how to rationally cultivate sufficient highway technical talents is a matter that should be paid attention to at present. After liberation, each economic sector has its own higher education institutions to train professional talents, but only highways have not established a single-discipline college to prepare its reserve forces (the Soviet Union currently has five highway institutes). In order to fill this gap, the Ministry of Communications, with the consent of the Ministry of Higher Education, and with the approval of the State Council, began preparing to establish a highway institute in Tongxian County, Hebei Province, last year. More than 100 teachers have been gathered for further study and some dormitories have been built. However, due to instructions from higher authorities at the end of last year, it was suspended. In order to meet actual needs and based on the government's spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, the Ministry of Communications has re-drafted a smaller-scale highway institute preparation plan and submitted it to higher authorities for consideration and decision. This new plan fully considers the country's financial situation and meets the urgent needs of highway construction. I think this is correct. If this plan cannot be realized, it will in fact cause irreparable losses. This is how I consider the problem from the perspective of a highway worker, and it is not necessarily comprehensive. I hope that relevant departments will weigh the pros and cons and study and consider it. (Attached picture)

### 注意培养公路技术人才　周凤九提出筹建公路学院的建议

　　注意培养公路技术人才
　　周凤九提出筹建公路学院的建议
    我衷心地拥护毛主席的指示和周总理的报告。我完全同意陈叔通副主席所作的报告。
    我是一个公路工作者，请允许我在这里反映公路工程技术人员的一些情况，和谈一下个人的意见，请指教。
    甲、公路工程技术人员的一些情况：
    1、公路工程技术人员在工作方面：解放后的几年中，公路工程技术人员，在党的指导和鼓励下，在广大的祖国土地上留下了他们的足迹，付出了他们的劳动。他们冒着各种不同的恶劣气候，克服了生活上和工作上的艰苦条件。他们修过了最长的世界屋脊上的公路，也在祖国的极南边贡献了他们的辛勤劳动。几年来他们在自己的业务实践中，获得了一定的教育和锻炼。
    2、在高级知识分子的问题方面：自从去年中共中央提出了“关于高级知识分子的问题”的报告，宣布了对文艺工作者和科学工作者“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针以后，我们公路科学技术界的同志们和全国知识分子一样，得到新的鼓舞，感觉党和政府对我们亲切期望和关怀，使我们在工作中提高了责任感。在这以前我们公路工程技术人员中确有很多人，只顾勤劳地工作，不肯大胆反映意见，存在着顾虑，奉命惟谨，不敢争鸣。现在我们中间的不少人，已有了转变，能做到知无不言，言无不尽，但是还有些人对这个方针体会的不够。所以在我们技术人员中间对这个方针还需要继续贯彻，进一步地发扬民主，以便能把我们的力量更好地贡献给国家。因此我衷心地拥护毛主席对于这个方针的新指示。
    3、学习苏联先进经验方面：过去我们工程技术人员学了资本主义国家的一套，对于学习苏联先进经验，起初是有些抵触的。在经过苏联专家的热情帮助，和翻译苏联书籍的大量发行以及通过实际工作中的运用，普遍地有了认识，深深地体会到苏联技术的优越性，和苏联制度的合理性。因此引起学习苏联的热潮。
    但是我们过去在工作中由于学习苏联经验不深不透，也个别地发生了盲目应用生搬硬套的错误。我认为学习苏联先进经验除了具体地学习它的科学技术内容以外，更重要的是掌握它的精神实质和运用方法，如果忽视了这一点就会造成不切实际的教条主义，反而会失去了它的优越作用。自从党中央一再提出克服在工作中教条主义的指示，并提出了百家争鸣的方针之后，我们一般地克服了学习苏联的片面性。今后我们要在这方面继续努力，在以学习苏联为主的原则下，接受其他国家和我们自己的先进经验，反对教条主义，来搞好我们的公路建设事业。
    乙、个人的意见：
    4、此外我还想趁这个机会反映一点小小的意见，供大会的参考：
    公路事业在国防上和在国家经济及人民生活中的重要性，是各位委员所熟悉的。它的科学技术性很高，凡属路面桥梁等的设计施工，都有它的技术复杂性，可是现有公路技术人员非常缺乏。1956年全国地方道路一般地质量不高就是缺乏技术指导的缘故，因此如何合理培养足够的公路技术人材，是当前应该注意的事。解放后，各经济部门都有它的高等学院，来培养专业人才，惟独公路还没有建立起单科性学院来准备它的后备力量（苏联现有五所公路学院），交通部为了填补这个空白，去年商得高教部的同意，经国务院的批准，在河北通县筹建公路学院。已集中了百余教师在进修。并建筑了一部分宿舍。但由于去年年底的上级指示而缓办了。交通部为了适应实际需要并根据政府的增产节约精神，重新拟定一个规模较小的公路学院筹建计划，送请上级考虑决定。这个新方案是充分考虑了国家财力情况，并符合公路建设迫切需要的。我认为这是正确的，如果这个计划不能实现，那末事实上将会造成不可补偿的损失。这是我从公路工作者的角度来考虑问题，不一定全面。希望有关部门权衡轻重，研究考虑。（附图片）
