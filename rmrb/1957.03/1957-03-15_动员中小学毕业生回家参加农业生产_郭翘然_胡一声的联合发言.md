    We warmly support Chairman Mao's instructions and Premier Zhou's report, and agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the Standing Committee, and Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech on increasing production and practicing economy.

    We are members of democratic parties and also cadres in cultural and educational work. We would like to express some opinions related to scientific research and student enrollment, based on our experiences:

    I. Issues Related to Scientific Research

    Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the slogan of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" last spring and called on intellectuals across the country to march towards science, intellectuals across the country have been greatly encouraged, their work and study have been filled with confidence, potential strengths have been continuously brought into play, and all positive factors have been playing a role. This is also the case in Guangdong, specifically manifested in:

    1.  Guangzhou's universities and colleges have established leading bodies for scientific research and have achieved certain results. Each institution has held one or two scientific discussion meetings, with considerable enthusiasm for contention. For example, the scientific discussion meeting held by Sun Yat-sen University since the end of last year presented 108 papers for discussion, and many of the papers were of good quality, making a good start for the "Hundred Schools of Thought" in South China.

    2.  Many intellectuals have formulated personal plans for scientific research or further studies, and actively participated in research work and academic debates. Taking the members of the China Democratic League in Guangzhou's universities and colleges as an example, according to incomplete understanding at the end of last year, 150 members had formulated scientific research plans, with more than 300 research projects. The cultural and artistic circles in Guangdong also actively carried out creative activities during this period. Many middle school teachers have also made personal further study and research plans, and everyone is bringing their enthusiasm and creativity into play.

    However, there are still many problems in scientific research work, and we hope that relevant parties will study and solve them.

    (1) There is still a lack of close contact between various research institutions, and even within the same university, the work of "exchanging information and unifying arrangements" has not been done well. For example, the South China Institute of Technology and the South China Agricultural College in Guangzhou were originally one family, but they rarely contact each other on certain scientific research with interrelated nature, which cannot but affect the coordination and exertion of scientific research forces. For example, a teacher at the South China Agricultural College is tirelessly researching a certain problem, while another person has already researched the results he wants to achieve. If the regions, universities, colleges, and research institutions can exchange information, unify arrangements, cooperate with each other, and work together, more and better results will be achieved in scientific research work.

    (2) In scientific research, there is still a serious shortage of scientific information, books and materials, and scientific instruments. Some teachers have formulated research projects, but they have to interrupt their research due to the lack of books, materials, and instruments and medicines. For example, teachers at South China Normal University formulated a total of 123 research projects last year, about 50% of which could not be completed. The most important reason is the lack of books and equipment. For example, a teacher at Sun Yat-sen University who studies world history feels that the most difficult thing is the lack of materials; a teacher named Lin at South China Normal University wants to study Mozi, but the library does not have suitable materials. Because the funds for purchasing books and instruments are too small, even Chinese books and magazines are not complete in various universities and colleges. At the end of last year, the central government allocated a considerable amount of book funds to various universities and colleges, but it was issued in mid-October and had to be turned over in mid-December. In the same short period of time, everyone rushed to buy them, but the supply of goods was small, and it was difficult to buy books. This year, we are vigorously practicing economy, and the book purchase fee for some universities and colleges is calculated at only eight jiao per student. After purchasing newspapers and magazines, there is little left. For example, South China Normal University has 3,000 students, and the annual book fee is only 29,000 yuan, but the annual expenditure on newspapers and magazines of the college is 24,000 yuan, and it is difficult to meet the needs of students and research work with the remaining 5,000 yuan. Therefore, everyone hopes that the necessary funds for scientific research should not be saved too much.

    (3) Some comrades have some problems in their understanding of scientific research and "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." Some look down on the research work of middle school teachers and young teachers, and are reluctant to give support. They believe that scientific research is purely a matter for experts and university professors, and ordinary people should not waste their efforts. Some people recklessly label others in the contention issue, and rashly criticize opposing arguments as "anti-Marxist-Leninist," "the rise of decadent class consciousness," etc., which makes people participating in the debate feel discouraged and have great concerns. In addition, some people have the idea of seeking quick success in scientific research, and the arrangement of scientific discussion meetings also has a blitzkrieg nature, which affects some papers being immature and of poor quality. Therefore, we hope that leaders at all levels will encourage and support all those who have the conditions and determination to conduct research work; adopt the attitude of "the more truth is debated, the clearer it becomes" towards contention, and never suppress it; and arrange scientific discussions on a regular basis, not "blitzkrieg," and it is best to carry out scientific discussions in a systematic way by holding annual meetings by various specialized societies.

    In addition, we have two small suggestions:

    ① Establish branches of various specialized societies in various regions to lead various scientific research work and avoid the phenomenon of each doing its own thing and repeating work.

    ② Exchange book and instrument catalogs and share resources among universities and colleges and research institutions in the same region to supplement the current shortage of books and instruments.

    II. Issues Related to Student Enrollment

    This year, the enrollment of schools at all levels in the country is less than last year. Not only are there problems with the future of primary and junior high school graduates, but also with the future of senior high school graduates. Last year, various undertakings developed greatly, and various factories, mines, organs, schools, enterprises, and institutions absorbed many staff members. This year, we are vigorously practicing economy, and government departments generally do not absorb new staff members, so the employment scope for middle and primary school graduates is even smaller. Therefore, this year's student enrollment issue is quite tense, and it is natural that everyone pays attention to it. We believe that everyone should pay attention to this issue and work together to solve it. We should understand that the enrollment of schools at all levels last year was too much, and there was some recklessness. It is reasonable and necessary to appropriately shrink this year, and the number of students enrolled in schools at all levels this year is still much more than in 1955, returning to the road of steady progress, which is of great benefit to improving the quality of education. At the same time, the original purpose of national education is to enable the vast majority of middle and primary school graduates to participate in productive labor and make it easier to modernize industrial and agricultural production. Even in such an advanced socialist country as the Soviet Union, it is impossible for every child to directly ascend from elementary school to middle school to university. More than 500 million of China's 600 million people are agricultural population, and China's current production and construction mainly relies on agriculture. At this time, when the national agricultural cooperation has been basically completed, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued a call to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest in 1957, but striving for a bumper agricultural harvest is inseparable from the technological reform of agriculture, improving water and soil, planting cash crops, and developing various sideline productions. That is to say, agricultural cooperatives across the country increasingly need more knowledgeable youths to support them. Therefore, mobilizing a large number of middle and primary school graduates to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production can solve the problem of the future of most people.

    However, the student enrollment issue is still quite serious, and we must tap all potential and bring into play all positive factors to enroll more students to overcome some of the difficulties that our country cannot avoid during the transition period. We put forward a few immature suggestions as follows:

    1.  Mobilize township people's committees and agricultural cooperatives to use the night or slack farming season to organize cultural tutoring and agricultural technical training for middle and primary school graduates who cannot go to school and return to the countryside, so that they still have the opportunity to study and settle down to engage in production or prepare to take the school entrance exam again next year. And they can be organized to come up with various ways to educate out-of-school children in rural areas and help solve the problem of children's enrollment.

    2.  In all middle and primary schools with conditions, try to run a two-shift system, accommodate as many students as possible in each class, and squeeze out some houses in the original school buildings as much as possible to enroll more students.

    3.  Reward people for running schools and develop private schools. In addition to welcoming overseas Chinese, compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau, and the industrial and commercial sectors to donate money to set up schools to widely accommodate students, encourage organs, schools, industrial and mining enterprises, and people's organizations to set up schools as much as possible to accommodate the children of employees.

    4.  Formulate appropriate regulations to allow qualified social intellectuals to use school spare time and private vacant houses to run night schools and tutoring schools of various subjects or technical nature learning classes under the guidance of educational administrative departments to accommodate voluntary teenagers and children.

    In addition, we think that the Chinese school system is six years of elementary school, six years of middle school, and four to five years of university. It takes 16 to 17 years to graduate from elementary school to university, and students spend too much time in school. Is it possible to consider shortening it a bit? For example, the Soviet Union has ten years of primary and secondary school and five years of university, a total of fifteen years. If we can also reduce one or two years of primary and secondary school, the turnover rate of existing schools will be greater, and we can enroll many more students.

    The above are all our very immature opinions, please criticize and correct them.

    动员中小学毕业生回家参加农业生产
    郭翘然  胡一声的联合发言
    我们热诚拥护毛主席的指示和周总理的报告，并同意李富春副总理对第二个五年计划建议的说明和陈叔通副主席所作的常务委员会工作报告，以及陈云副总理关于增产节约的发言。
    我们是民主党派的成员，又是文教工作的干部，现将我们所接触到的有关科学研究和学生就学、升学问题，发表一些意见：
    一、有关科学研究问题
    自去年春天中共中央提出“百家争鸣，百花齐放”，号召全国知识分子向科学大进军以后，全国知识分子受到了极大的鼓舞，工作和学习都充满了信心，潜在力量在不断发挥，一切积极因素在起着作用，这在广东方面也没有例外，具体表现在：
    1、广州各高等学校，都建立了科学研究的领导机构，也取得了一定的成绩：各院校都举行过一次或二次的科学讨论会，争鸣得相当热烈。例如中山大学去年底开始举行的科学讨论会，提出讨论的论文一百零八篇，有不少论文的质量是很好的，为华南的百家争鸣作了良好的开端。
    2、许多知识分子都制定了科学研究或进修的个人规划，积极参加研究工作和学术上的争论，即以民主同盟在广州高等学校的成员来说，据去年底不完全的了解，已有一百五十位盟员订了科学研究的规划，研究项目达三百余项。广东文化艺术界在这个时期也积极开展了创作活动。不少中学教师也做了个人进修和研究的规划，大家都在发挥积极性和创造性。
    但在科学研究的工作中，也还存在不少问题，希望有关方面加以研究解决。
    （1）各个研究机构之间，目前还缺乏密切的联系，甚至在同一个高等学校内也没有做好“互通声气，统一安排”的工作。例如广州华南工、农学院原是一家，对某些有相互关联性质的科学研究也很少联系，这不能不影响到科学研究力量的配合和发挥。又如华南农学院有一教师孜孜不倦地在研究某一项问题，而另有一人却早已把他所要求达到的结果研究出来了。要是在地区之间、院校之间、各个研究机构之间能够互通声气，统一安排，互相配合共同努力，对科学研究工作就会取得更多更好的成绩。
    （2）在科学研究方面，还严重存在科学情报、图书资料、和科学仪器不足的问题。有些教师拟订了研究项目，但由于缺乏图书资料和仪器药品等等，不能不中断研究。例如华南师范学院教师去年共订了研究项目一百二十三项，约有50％不能完成，其中最重要的原因是缺少图书、器材。又如中山大学研究世界史的教师，感到最困难的是没有资料；华南师院有位姓林的教师想研究墨子，但图书馆没有适用的资料。因为图书、仪器购置费太少，各高等院校甚至连中文的图书、杂志也很不完备，去年底中央曾拨给各院校一笔数目相当的图书费，但10月中旬下达，12月中旬又要上缴，在同一短时间内，大家都争先抢购、货源又少，很难购到图书。今年厉行节约，有些院校的图书购置费只按每个学生八角计算，除购置报纸、杂志外，所余无几了。如华南师院有学生三千人，全年只有二万九千元图书费，但该院全年报纸、杂志费用的支出就要二万四千元，余五千元是很难满足学生及研究工作的要求的。因此，大家希望不要把科学研究的必需经费节约太多。
    （3）有些同志在科学研究及“百家争鸣，百花齐放”的认识上存在一些问题。有的对中学教师及青年教师的研究工作瞧不起，不屑给予支持，他们认为科学研究纯粹是专家和大学教授的事，一般人可别要白费心机。有些人在争鸣问题上乱扣帽子，对相反的论点轻率地加以“反马列主义”“没落阶级意识的抬头”等等的批评，使参加争论的人感到灰心、顾虑很大。另外还有些人对科学研究工作有求其速成的思想，布置科学讨论会也带有突击性质，影响到有些论文不够成熟，质量不高。因此，我们希望各级领导对凡是有条件而又有决心进行研究工作的人都给予鼓励和支持；对争鸣采取“真理愈辩愈明”的态度，绝不压制；对于科学讨论要作经常性的布置，不要搞“突击”，最好能由各专门学会系统以举行年会的方式来开展科学讨论。
    另外，我们还有二点小建议：
    ①各地区成立各专门学会的分会，以领导各种科学研究的工作，避免各自为政，工作重复的现象。
    ②同一地区的各高等院校及研究机构交换图书仪器目录、互通有无，以补目前图书仪器的不足。二、关于学生就学升学问题
    今年国家各级学校招生较去年为少，不但是高小、初中毕业生的出路有问题，而且高中毕业生的出路也有问题。去年各项事业大发展，各厂矿、机关、学校、企业事业单位吸收了不少工作人员，今年厉行节约，各机关单位一般不吸收新工作人员，中小学毕业生就业范围就更少了。因此，今年的学生就学升学问题相当紧张，引起大家的重视是很自然的。我们认为大家重视这个问题，还要大家共同努力来解决这个问题。我们应该了解：去年各级学校的招生数是太多的，是有些冒进的，今年适当收缩是合理的，是必要的，而且今年各级学校招生的数量还是比1955年多得多，回到了稳步前进的道路，这在提高教育质量上有很大的好处。同时，国家教育的本旨，原是要使绝大部分的中小学毕业生去参加生产劳动，使工农业生产更容易现代化。就像苏联那样进步的社会主义国家，也不可能让每个儿童都由小学而中学而大学地直线升学。我国六亿人口中有五亿以上是农业人口，而且我国目前的生产建设，主要还是依靠农业，当此全国农业合作化已基本完成的时候，中共中央提出了争取1957年农业大丰收的号召，但争取农业大丰收是和农业的技术改革、改良水土、种植经济作物和发展各种副业生产分不开的。就是说全国农业合作社越来越需要更多的知识青年去支援。因此，动员大批的中小学毕业生到农村去参加农业生产就可以解决大部分人的出路问题。
    但是学生的就学及升学问题还是相当严重的，我们必须发掘一切潜力及发挥一切积极因素来多收学生，以克服我们国家在过渡时期所不能避免的一些困难。我们提出几点不成熟的建议如下：
    1、动员乡人民委员会及农业合作社利用夜间或农闲时期，组织不能升学回到农村的中小学毕业生进行文化补习及农业技术训练，使他们仍有学习的机会，安心下来从事生产或准备明年再考学校。并可组织他们想出种种办法教育农村失学儿童，协助解决儿童就学问题。
    2、在一切有条件的中小学里尽量举办二部制，在每一个班里尽可能多容几个学生，并尽可能在原有校舍内挤出一些房子来多收学生。
    3、奖励人民办学，发展民办学校。除欢迎华侨、港澳同胞及工商界捐资兴学，以广收容外，鼓励机关、学校、工矿企业、人民团体尽可能附设学校，收容职工子女。
    4、制定适当条例，容许有资格的社会知识分子利用学校课余时间，民间空余房屋，在教育行政部门指导之下，举办夜校和各科补习学校或技术性质的学习班，以收容自愿入学的青少年及儿童。
    此外，我们想我国学制是小学六年，中学六年，大学四至五年，从小学到大学毕业共需十六年至十七年，学生在校时间太长，是否可以考虑缩短一些，比如苏联是中小学十年，大学五年，共十五年。假如我们也可以把中小学减少一二年的话，现有学校的周转率就大一些，就可以多招不少学生了。
    以上都是我们很不成熟的意见，请各位同志批评指正。
