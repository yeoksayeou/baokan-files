Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department announced on the 6th that it would not pursue any responsibility for Tian Xiuchang, a special agent dispatched from Taiwan who had surrendered to the People's Government. Furthermore, according to his own wishes, he would be helped to return to his hometown of Yancheng County, Henan Province, for proper resettlement. This twenty-four-year-old young man, who had once gone astray, is now packing his bags with joy, preparing to return to his hometown, which he has been away from for ten years, and reunite with his family.

	Surrender at Shenzhen Bridge

On the afternoon of October 28th last year, a young traveler appeared in the bustling crowd at Shenzhen Railway Station. When he passed the People's Liberation Army哨所 [Sentry post] at the northern end of the Shenzhen Bridge, he looked a little flustered, seeming to want to go forward but hesitating. But finally, he made up his mind and stepped inside.

The PLA officer on duty at the bridgehead questioned him briefly, and he summoned up his courage and said, "I am a special agent sent by Taiwan. I am here to surrender to the People's Government."

	Led Astray

This young man is Tian Xiuchang, mentioned earlier.

In 1949, on the eve of the mainland's complete liberation, he fled to Taiwan with a relative who was a Kuomintang officer. He was only sixteen years old at the time. Under the influence of this relative, he joined the Kuomintang in 1952 while working at a naval shipyard in Keelung City. The Kuomintang secret service also took a liking to him. In the spring of 1956, he finally became a special agent of the Chiang Kai-shek group's "Intelligence Bureau," and received special agent training alone in the "Single Training Room" of the Chiang Kai-shek group's secret service agency in the suburbs of Taipei. At the end of the training, his special agent superior told him to write letters to his relatives in his hometown of Henan, saying that after liberation he was "wandering alone in Hong Kong and now living a very hard life." These letters were collected and forwarded by the secret service agency in Hong Kong so that Tian Xiuchang could use these relationships to sneak back to the mainland in the future.

Before long, Tian Xiuchang's older brother replied. Tian Xiuchang's secret service superior taught him to continue communicating with his family. After continuing to receive letters from Tian Xiuchang, his brother was very concerned about this "wandering" younger brother and asked him what help he needed. At this time, the secret service agency believed that the time for dispatch was "ripe."

A "senior official" of the Chiang Kai-shek group's "Intelligence Bureau" received Tian Xiuchang in early July 1956, personally "instructing him" that his task was "action sabotage," but he was to "lie dormant for a long time and wait for an opportunity to act." And after he had "established a foothold" on the mainland, he was to begin developing an organization, etc. Valuable intelligence to coordinate with military operations still had to be collected and reported. The secret service chief also made specific arrangements for his activities, activity areas, etc., and awarded him the rank of "lieutenant," expressing great "expectations" for him.

	"Determination" Wavering

After Tian Xiuchang arrived in Hong Kong, he contacted the "Intelligence Bureau's" special agents stationed in Hong Kong. These special agents actively prepared for Tian Xiuchang's return to the mainland, while also asking him to familiarize himself with the Hong Kong environment and read the motherland's newspapers and periodicals, so that he could pretend to have worked in Hong Kong for the past few years and disguise himself as progressive. At the same time, he was instructed to continue to maintain contact with his older brother.

For Tian Xiuchang, who had been poisoned by Kuomintang propaganda, everything reported in the motherland's newspapers and periodicals was new. These newspapers and periodicals told him that the motherland was engaged in magnificent construction, the country was becoming stronger and wealthier every day, and the people's lives were becoming increasingly prosperous. Tian Xiuchang later recalled that what impressed him deeply was that the motherland had manufactured complex products such as cars and airplanes. This picture that unfolded before him was completely contrary to the set of propaganda he had heard in the past. Faced with such new things, his thinking began to become confused. "Is all this really true? Have I been deceived in the past?" These questions appeared in his mind for the first time.

His brother sent him more and more letters. The letters successively told Tian Xiuchang that his family had joined the collective farm, and there was surplus grain every year, and that he himself had become the head of a primary school, etc. Every letter could not but evoke Tian Xiuchang's memories of the past. He remembered that his family used to be destitute, and it was because of this that he had been forced to follow that high-ranking relative outside from a young age. Now, however, the family's situation was getting better day by day, and his brother, who used to be a Kuomintang officer, was now the head of a primary school. Tian Xiuchang said that he asked himself, if the newspapers and periodicals were "propaganda," could his brother's words still be untrustworthy? In addition, he recalled the many smoggy and chaotic things he had seen in Taiwan, and slowly, he realized that he had been deceived in the past. His "determination" to be a special agent began to waver. "Who am I betraying my country for?" he asked himself.

News of the cracking of more than a dozen batches of special agents in Guangzhou was published in Hong Kong newspapers during this period. For Tian Xiuchang, this news was a serious warning. Any enemy who betrays the motherland will only face such a fate. Tian Xiuchang said that at the same time, he also saw another fate for special agents in the newspaper. A special agent named Wang Xianjing was treated leniently after surrendering in Guangzhou and was assigned to work in a state-owned store. Two paths, which way to go, he faced the moment of final test.

	Choosing the Path of Self-Renewal

"Can the motherland forgive me?" This was Tian Xiuchang's biggest concern at the time. Just at this time, another letter from his brother came. Because many of the facts he had fabricated in his previous letters to his family were inconsistent, his brother became suspicious of him. He questioned him about how he had been with that relative all along, and how he had ended up wandering in Hong Kong again? And he advised him: don't wander anymore. No matter what bad things you have done in the past or now, just come back and explain them clearly. Tian Xiuchang recalled that his mood when he read this letter was one of excitement, fear, and hope intertwined. He said: I had no other choice at that time. My brother said very clearly that if I came back and explained things clearly, there would be no problem. Could I not believe it? Moreover, he was already suspicious before I went back. Wouldn't I be exposed if I went back! Moreover, I have been away from home for almost ten years. I love my mother, I love my hometown. Why should I be a special agent to betray my country? He said that although he still had some doubts at the time, he finally made up his mind: surrender to the People's Government and start a new life!

At noon on October 28, 1956, Tian Xiuchang boarded the train to Luohu (a station south of Shenzhen). Two hours later, he appeared on the Shenzhen Bridge. He chose a bright path for himself.

    他选择了光明的道路
    ——记一个台湾特务分子的自首
    新华社记者　方力
    广东省公安厅6日宣布对从台湾派遣回来的已向人民政府投案自首的特务分子田秀昌不加任何追究，并且根据他本人的意愿，帮助他回到他的家乡河南省郾城县作适当安置。这个曾经误入歧途的二十四岁的年青人，这几天正怀着愉快的心情收拾行装，准备回到阔别十年的故乡，跟家人团聚。
    在深圳桥头自首
    去年10月28日的下午，在深圳车站上熙熙攘攘的人群中，出现了一个青年旅客。当他通过深圳桥北端我人民解放军岗哨的时候，神色有点仓惶，似乎欲行又止，但最后终于下了决心，一步就踏进来了。
    在桥头值勤的解放军军官向他略一盘问，他就鼓起勇气说了出来：“我是台湾派来的特务，我来向人民政府自首。”
    误入歧途
    这个青年人就是前面说的田秀昌。
    在1949年大陆全面解放前夕，他随着一个当国民党军官的亲戚逃到台湾。那时他只有十六岁。在这个亲戚的影响下，1952年他在基隆市一个海军船厂工作的时候加入了国民党。国民党特务机关也看上了他。1956年春，他终于成为蒋介石集团“情报局”的特务人员，并且在台北市郊蒋介石集团特务机关的“单训室”里单独地接受了特务训练。训练结束时，他的特务上司就叫他给住在河南家乡的亲人写信，信中说解放后他“一个人流浪在香港，现在生活很苦”。这些信都由香港的特务机关转收转发，以便田秀昌日后能利用这些关系潜回大陆。
    没有多久，田秀昌的哥哥来了复信。田秀昌的特务上司就教他继续和家里通信。他哥哥在继续收到田秀昌的来信后，对这个“流浪”的弟弟非常关切，并且问他需要什么帮助。这时候，特务机关认为：派遣的时机已经“成熟”了。
    蒋介石集团“情报局”的一个“高级官员”，在1956年7月初接见了田秀昌，亲自“面授机宜”，告诉田秀昌的任务是“行动爆破”，但要他“长期潜伏，待机行事”。并且要他在大陆“生根立足”以后，就开始进行发展组织等等，配合军事行动有价值的情报仍然要收集上报。特务头子对他的活动方法、活动地区等也作了具体布置，还授予他“中尉”军衔，对他表示了很大的“期望”。
    “决心”动摇
    田秀昌来到香港以后，就跟“情报局”驻港特务分子联系上了。这些特务分子一面积极为田秀昌潜回大陆作准备，一面要他熟悉香港环境和阅读祖国的书报，以便将来他能冒充这几年在香港工作和伪装进步。同时，还指示田秀昌继续同他哥哥保持联系。
    对于饱受国民党毒素宣传的田秀昌来说，祖国书报中所报道的一切事物都是新鲜的。这些书报告诉他，祖国正在进行着宏伟的建设，国家天天走向富强，人民的生活日益富裕。田秀昌后来回忆说，给他印象很深的是，像汽车和飞机这样复杂的产品祖国都制造出来了。展现在他眼前的这一幅图景，跟他过去听到的那一套宣传都截然相反。在这样的新事物面前，他的思想开始变得混乱了。“这一切是不是都是真的？我过去是不是都受骗了？”他的脑际第一次出现了这些疑问。
    他哥哥给他的来信愈来愈多了。信中先后告诉田秀昌，家里已参加了集体农庄，粮食每年都有余，他本人做了小学负责人等等。每一封信都不能不引起田秀昌对往事的回忆。他想起自己家里过去一贫如洗，也因为这样，才迫使他从小就跟随那个做大官的亲戚在外面奔跑。现在家庭的光景却一天比一天好，哥哥过去当国民党军官，现在却做了小学负责人。田秀昌说，他自己问自己，假如书报说的是“宣传”，难道哥哥的话还不可信？再加上他回想起在台湾看到的许多乌烟瘴气的事情，慢慢地，他觉悟到自己过去受了骗。他做特务的“决心”开始动摇了。“我背叛祖国究竟为了谁？”他这样问自己。
    广州市破获十几批特务的消息，恰巧这期间在香港报纸登载出来了。对于田秀昌，这些消息是个严重的警告。任何背叛祖国的敌人，等待他的就只有这样的命运。田秀昌说，他同一时候在报上也看到了特务分子的另一种命运。一个叫王显晶的特务分子在广州自首后受到了宽大处理，被分配在一家国营商店工作。两条道路，何去何从，他面临到了最后考验的时刻。
    选择自新之路
      “祖国能不能原谅我？”这是田秀昌当时最大的顾虑。就在这个时候，他哥哥的又一封信来了。由于他前几次给家里的信中伪造的事实有许多前后矛盾，他哥哥对他怀疑起来了。质问他过去一直跟那个亲戚，后来怎又会流浪香港？并且劝告他：不要再流浪了。不管过去或现在做了什么坏事，只要回来交代清楚就好了。田秀昌回忆他读了这封信的时候的心情是，激动、惊恐和希望交织在一起。他说：我那时再没有别的抉择了，哥哥说得很清楚，回来交代清楚就没有事，我能不信？而且我还未回去他已怀疑，回去还能不暴露！而且，我离家快十年了，我爱妈妈，爱我的家乡。我干吗要做特务来背叛自己的祖国？他说，尽管那时他还有点疑虑，但他终于下了决心：向人民政府自首，重新做人！
    1956年10月28日的中午，田秀昌踏上了开往罗湖（深圳南面一个站）的列车。两小时后，他就出现在深圳桥上。他为自己选择了一条光明的道路。
