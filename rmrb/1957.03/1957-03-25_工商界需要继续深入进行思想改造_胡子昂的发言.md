I wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people and Premier Zhou's report on his visit to eleven Asian and European countries. I fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the Standing Committee, Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech on increasing production and practicing economy, and Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of the Second Five-Year Plan.

Recently, I accompanied the delegation of the National People's Congress on a visit to six socialist countries, including the Soviet Union. I personally witnessed the rapid development of socialist and communist construction in fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, the stable lives of the people, and the increasing national strength. The consolidation and unity of the socialist camp has become a strong fortress for winning lasting world peace. They regarded our delegation's visit as a most esteemed friendship and expressed great welcome. They gave a high evaluation of the peaceful transformation of China's industrial and commercial circles, calling us "Chinese-style capitalists." This is the glory gained by the Chinese national bourgeoisie accepting socialist transformation under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

Now I will focus on Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Council meeting regarding the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and talk about my understanding.

Chairman Mao's instructions on the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce pointed out the main problems currently existing in the industrial and commercial circles and once again gave us guidance on the direction of our efforts. Over the years, under the leadership and education of the Party, the industrial and commercial circles have made great progress. In particular, after accepting Chairman Mao's instructions on recognizing the future, understanding the laws of social development, and mastering our own destiny, socialist enthusiasm has greatly increased. After the establishment of joint state-private ownership in all industries, many people have worked hard to study, conscientiously remold themselves, actively participate in socialist competitions, and contribute their knowledge and skills. Many people have been recognized as advanced producers or advanced workers. Recently, many people from industrial and commercial circles have participated in the work of government agencies at all levels and have positions and powers to work freely. This fully demonstrates that due to the correct leadership of the Party, its ability to apply the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism in combination with China's specific conditions, and the adoption of the organizational form of the people's democratic united front, the core figures of the industrial and commercial circles and the broad masses they are connected with are organized. Through peaceful transformation, under the Party's long-term cultivation and education, the industrial and commercial circles are helped to accept transformation, transforming the bourgeoisie from antagonistic to non-antagonistic to the working class, and turning the useful experience and expertise of capitalists into national wealth. This positive and progressive role is the main aspect of the industrial and commercial circles.

Negative Emotions Must Be Resolutely Eliminated

However, we must not say that there is no more duality in the industrial and commercial circles, let alone that the capitalists have been transformed to be almost the same as the workers and no longer need to be transformed. Recently, we received some feedback that some people are unwilling to hear the word "transformation," insisting: "Now we have been transformed almost completely. Even if we need to transform, aren't we still the same as the working class?" This kind of thinking and view is not conducive to the transformation of the industrial and commercial circles, is incorrect, and is not in accordance with the facts. According to our understanding, the vast majority of people in the industrial and commercial circles are good after the establishment of joint state-private ownership, but there are still some people who do not have much enthusiasm for work and are not as fond of the enterprise as they were during the private period. Some people say: "In the past, our bodies were at home, but our hearts were in the factory. Now that we have left the enterprise, we have no concerns"; some believe that since there are already "three fixations" ("fixed interest, fixed position, fixed salary"), why bother to make trouble for ourselves; some consider themselves to be the "second in command" in the enterprise, and everything is taken care of by the "boss" (the state representative), so they push all responsibilities to the state representative. There are also some people who regard themselves as "wealth," believing that production cannot be done without me, so they look down on the state representatives and workers. The existence of these negative thoughts and emotions shows that our industrial and commercial circles do not no longer need transformation, but need to continue deepening transformation. Chairman Mao instructed us: Everyone needs to be transformed, so do we in the industrial and commercial circles not need to be transformed? Moreover, we in the industrial and commercial circles have not completely escaped the status of exploiters today. Even if we give up fixed interest and take off our hats in the future, we will still have to go through a fairly long period of ideological transformation. Changing from a capitalist to a self-reliant laborer is not like Sun Wukong in Journey to the West, changing as soon as it is said, such an easy thing, but a transformation process that requires a change of heart and mind. Without firm confidence and determination, and without paying a considerable amount of effort and making persistent efforts, it is impossible to achieve. Some people say: "Encouraging the industrial and commercial circles to accept transformation should not pour cold water," but in order to keep everyone's minds clear, it is better to be realistic. We must guard against arrogance and impatience, and correct our mistakes. Therefore, we in the industrial and commercial circles should always follow Chairman Mao's instructions, study again and again, and transform again and again.

Changing the Bourgeois Standpoint, Views, and Methods Is an Arduous Process

At the present stage, what is the content of the ideological transformation of the industrial and commercial circles? I believe that the main thing is to enable the industrial and commercial circles to obtain a correct standpoint, views, and methods through study and transformation. That is to say, we must enable the industrial and commercial circles to gradually learn to replace the bourgeois standpoint, views, and methods with the standpoint, views, and methods of the working class, and gradually learn to use the standpoint, views, and methods of the working class to observe problems and handle work, and combine personal interests with national interests to achieve the goal of "destroying capitalism and establishing socialism." This is an arduous task of ideological transformation, and this task has not been completed for us in the industrial and commercial circles. However, as long as we work hard through the three main aspects of production and management work practice, social activities, and political theory study, we can achieve results. Since last year, under the leadership and promotion of the National Committee of the CPPCC, short-term training classes or short-term political studies for the industrial and commercial circles have been held in various places, which have achieved remarkable results in helping and promoting the ideological transformation of the industrial and commercial circles. In Chongqing, a capitalist who had been engaged in the textile industry for forty years once told me: "For forty years, I have always believed that running a factory depends on my own capital, technology, and efforts, and I have never admitted that there is exploitation of workers. After studying, my consistent view for forty years has been shaken." Why was it shaken? He said that this was because after studying the theory of Marxism-Leninism, his capitalist ideology and socialist ideology fought in his mind, and finally the new ideology won. This example is enough to show that study is very important for the ideological transformation of our industrial and commercial circles.

Last year, during the National Federation of Industry and Commerce Members' Congress, Chairman Mao instructed us to love the country, connect personal affairs with national affairs, and play a positive role in serving socialism. In this speech, Chairman Mao especially mentioned the current direction of efforts for the industrial and commercial circles, and we express our sincere gratitude. We believe that friends in the industrial and commercial circles will certainly follow Chairman Mao's instructions and use these instructions as a measure to measure themselves, frankly discover their own shortcomings at any time, and always strive for self-transformation, and not feel unhappy in their hearts when they hear the word "transformation." Over the past few years, we have realized that accepting transformation must accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the working class. As long as we sincerely accept transformation, we will surely sincerely accept leadership. In the future, our industrial and commercial circles should further accept socialist transformation under the leadership of the Party and the government. Through continuous efforts, we will surely completely transform ourselves into a veritable laborer. Make greater contributions to socialism, and hope that friends in the industrial and commercial circles will work hard together. (Attached picture)

### 工商界需要继续深入进行思想改造　胡子昂的发言

    工商界需要继续深入进行思想改造
　　胡子昂的发言
    我衷心拥护毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的指示和周总理关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告，完全同意陈叔通副主席关于常务委员会的工作报告，陈云副总理关于增产节约的发言和李富春副总理关于第二个五年计划的说明。
    最近一段时期，我曾经随全国人民代表大会代表团，访问了苏联等六个社会主义国家。我亲眼看到苏联、捷克斯洛伐克等兄弟国家的社会主义、共产主义建设事业正在突飞猛进的发展，人民生活安定，国力日益强大。社会主义阵营的巩固团结已经成为争取世界持久和平的坚强堡垒。它们对我们代表团的访问，认为是一次最尊贵的友谊，表示了极大的欢迎。对我国工商界和平改造给予很高的评价，称我们是“中国式资本家”。这是由于在中国共产党的英明领导下，中国民族资产阶级接受了社会主义改造所获得的光荣。
    我现在专对毛主席这次在最高国务会议上的讲话中，对资本主义工商业的改造问题，谈一谈我的体会。
    毛主席对于资本主义工商业社会主义改造的指示，指出了工商界当前存在的主要问题，又一次给我们提示了努力的方向。这些年来，在党的领导和教育下，工商界是有很大的进步。尤其是接受了毛主席关于认清前途、认识社会发展规律、掌握自己命运的指示以后，社会主义积极性大大提高。全行业公私合营后，许多人努力学习，认真改造，积极参加社会主义竞赛，贡献了自己的知识和技能，有不少的人被评为先进生产者或先进工作者。最近以来，更有许多工商界人士参加了各级政府机关工作，并且有职有权，可以放手工作。这充分说明，由于党的正确领导，善于运用马克思列宁主义的普遍真理结合中国的具体情况，采取了人民民主统一战线的组织形式，把工商界的核心人物以及他们所联系的广大群众组织起来，通过和平改造的方式，在党的长期培养教育下，帮助工商界接受改造，使资产阶级同工人阶级由对抗的而转化为非对抗的，使资本家有用的经验和特长变成了国家财富。这种积极进步的作用，是工商界主要的一面。
    消极的情绪要坚决清除
    但是我们决不能讲工商界中现在已经没有两面性了，更不能讲资本家已经改造得同工人差不多了，可以不必再改造了。最近我们得到的一些反映，有人不愿听“改造”二字，硬说：“现在已经改造得差不多了，就是要改造，还不是同工人阶级一样吗？”这种想法和看法，是不利于工商界的改造，是不正确的，也是不符合事实的。据我们的了解全业合营后，工商界中绝大多数是好的，但还有部分人工作的劲头不大，对企业反不如私营时期那样热爱了。有人说：“过去是身在家，心在厂，现在离开企业，是毫无牵挂了”；有的认为既然已经“三定”有着，“定息、定职、定薪”，何必自找麻烦；有的自认为是企业里的“老二”，一切有“老大”（公方）去顶，于是把一切责任都推给公方。还有些人则以“财富”自居，认为要搞生产，非我不可，因而瞧不起公方，看不起工人。这些消极的思想情绪的存在，正说明了我们工商界不是不再需要改造而正是需要继续深入改造。毛主席指示我们：什么人都要改造，难道我们工商界还不要改造吗？何况我们工商界今天并没有完全脱离剥削者的地位，即使将来放弃定息，摘掉帽子，也还要经过一个相当长时期的思想改造。从一个资本家改变成为一个自食其力的劳动者，这不是西游记上的孙悟空，说变就变，那样轻而易举的事，而是一个脱胎换骨的改造过程。没有坚定的信心和决心，不付出相当大的力气，作坚持不懈的努力，是不可能实现的。有人说：“鼓励工商界接受改造，不可泼冷水”，但是我们为了保持大家头脑的清醒，还是实事求是的好，我们要戒骄戒躁，有错必纠。因此，我们工商界应该随时遵循着毛主席的指示，学习再学习，改造再改造。
    改变资产阶级的立场观点和方法是一个艰巨过程
    在现阶段，工商界思想改造的内容是什么呢？我认为，主要是使工商界经过学习改造，获得一个正确的立场、观点、方法。这就是说，要使工商界能够逐渐学习以工人阶级的立场、观点和方法来代替资产阶级的立场、观点和方法，逐步学会用工人阶级的立场、观点和方法来观察问题和处理工作，把个人的利益和国家的利益结合起来以达到“破资本主义、立社会主义”的目的。这是一个艰巨的思想改造任务，而这个任务对于我们工商界来说，并没有完成。但是，只要我们通过生产经营工作实践、社会活动、政治理论学习三个主要方面去努力，是能够取得成效的。从去年以来，在政协全国委员会的领导和推动下各地都举办了工商界短期训练班或者是短期政治学习，对于帮助和推动工商界的思想改造，取得了显著成绩。在重庆，有一位经营了四十年纺织业的资本家曾这样告诉我：“四十年来，我始终认为办厂是靠自己的本钱、技术和努力，根本就不承认对工人有剥削，经过学习后，我四十年来一贯的看法动摇了。”为什么会动摇呢？他说，这是由于学习了马克思列宁主义的理论，自己的资本主义思想与社会主义思想在脑子里经过斗争，最后新的思想胜利了。由这一事例足以说明，学习对于我们工商界的思想改造是十分重要的。
    去年，全国工商联会员大会期间，毛主席指示我们，要热爱国家，把个人的事情和国家的事情联系起来，发挥积极作用，为社会主义服务。毛主席这次的讲话中，特别提到工商界当前努力的方向，我们表示衷诚感激。我们相信工商界朋友们一定会遵照毛主席的这一指示并把这一指示作为一个尺度，来衡量一下自己，毫无隐讳地随时把自己的缺点发现出来，随时都要努力于自我改造，不要一听到“改造”两个字，心中就有些不愉快之感。几年来，我们认识到接受改造，必须接受中国共产党和工人阶级的领导，只要是忠诚地接受改造，必定会忠诚地接受领导，今后，我们工商界应在党和政府的领导下，进一步接受社会主义改造，通过继续不断的努力，我们一定会把自己彻底改造成为一个名副其实的劳动者。为社会主义作出更大的贡献，希望工商界的朋友们大家努力吧。（附图片）
