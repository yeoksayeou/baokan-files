Agricultural cooperatives must publicize finances
The recent "Notice on Several Matters Concerning Democratic Cooperative Management" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China lists the timely publicizing of financial revenue and expenditure as a major aspect of adhering to the principle of democratic cooperative management.

It is not difficult to imagine that cooperative members are very concerned about the financial revenue and expenditure of the cooperative. This is closely related to their vital interests. They cannot but be concerned about the public property of the cooperative, the use of public funds and materials, their own labor remuneration, and so on. This concern of the cooperative members should not be regarded as a difficulty for cooperative cadres in handling affairs; on the contrary, it should be regarded as a very important condition for running agricultural cooperatives well.

Yesterday, this newspaper published a news item: More than 400 agricultural cooperatives in Pixian County, Sichuan Province (northwest of Chengdu, 郫音皮), recently publicized the accounts of the cooperatives, which made the cooperative members extremely excited and greatly improved their enthusiasm for cooperative management and labor. This news shows how great a role it plays in consolidating agricultural cooperatives and running agricultural cooperatives well once the principle of democracy is earnestly implemented in economic management, especially in financial management.

The labor enthusiasm of some members of some cooperatives is not high enough, and a few members of some cooperatives are asking to withdraw from the cooperatives. This is not because the cooperative system itself is bad. The superiority of the cooperative system is visible to everyone. The reasons for these bad situations are varied: some are because some well-to-do middle peasants who lack labor power have temporarily reduced some income; some are because some difficulties occurred due to disasters last year; some are because cadres lacked experience at the beginning of the cooperative and some improper measures caused some dissatisfaction. However, one of the rather important reasons is that the financial work of these cooperatives is chaotic and unclear; or the financial work itself does not have any problems, but the accounts are not announced in time, so the cooperative members do not understand the financial situation within the cooperative and have doubts in their minds. A good way to solve these problems is to publicize finances. This is also very clear in the news from Pixian County.

In the future, all agricultural cooperatives should adopt the method proposed in the notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: announce all financial revenues and expenditures on time, let all members know, and let the masses participate in the evaluation. How often should it be announced? That depends on the specific situation of each place and each cooperative. Generally speaking, the revenue and expenditure distribution of agricultural production should be announced quarterly according to the different crops; seasonal sideline income should also be announced quarterly; major sideline income, various special funds (national loans, pre-purchase funds for agricultural products, relief funds, etc.), the expenditure of relatively large capital construction costs, the investment of cooperative members, etc., should be announced at any time; the labor days obtained by cooperative members (including cooperative cadres) should be announced at least once a month, or every ten days or half a month. Expenditure and use of materials should not be announced only after they have been used. Before they are used, they should be discussed with the cooperative members first: is it necessary to use them; which aspects should be used first and which aspects should be used later. Even if it is indeed necessary to use them, if the majority of cooperative members do not agree, they should not be used temporarily. The annual financial revenue and expenditure budget of the whole cooperative and the production team that implements financial contract should be repeatedly discussed at the general meeting of cooperative members or the meeting of cooperative member representatives, and then the cooperative cadres should follow it. If the situation changes and the budget needs to be significantly changed, it should also be discussed with the cooperative members. The financial expenditure of the whole cooperative must have a final annual account once a year and be announced at the end of the year. Only in this way can the cooperative members feel at ease and give full play to their enthusiasm for labor and investment. Only in this way can the cooperative members effectively supervise the financial work, so that the limited financial and material resources of the cooperative can play a greater role and the financial management work can avoid or reduce problems.

The financial revenue and expenditure of some cooperatives have not been fully settled or announced clearly, and the cooperative members demand that these old accounts be cleared. This demand is justified. Only by thoroughly clearing these old accounts can we strengthen the internal unity of the cooperative and develop collective production. However, seeing that spring plowing has already begun, there is a danger of delaying the major event of spring plowing if we are entangled in these old accounts. What should we do? We should deal with them separately according to the different situations of each cooperative and various different problems. In general, if it can be dealt with immediately and does not hinder the current production, it should naturally be dealt with immediately; if it involves many problems and is difficult to figure out for a while, it can be explained to the cooperative members that it must be cleared after the busy season of spring plowing, so that the cooperative members can feel at ease. If the situation in some cooperatives is more serious, and the masses have great opinions, and it is difficult to carry out production without clearing them, we can organize forces to carry out production on the one hand, and educate the masses not to delay production because of this; on the other hand, we can clear the accounts and announce the handling methods to the cooperative members as soon as possible. In any case, we should first tell the masses the notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, announce that we will earnestly implement financial disclosure from now on, and indeed do so in actual action.

Some cooperative cadres are somewhat worried about disclosing finances. In fact, this is completely unnecessary. By disclosing finances, various major economic measures of the cooperative can be built on the basis of the support of the cooperative members. This will never increase the difficulty of leadership, nor will it weaken the strength of leadership; on the contrary, it will make the leadership more powerful.

The results of party rectification and cooperative rectification in many places have proved that the eyes of the masses are bright and they can distinguish right from wrong. The nature and severity of the shortcomings and errors in financial work are different, and the masses can also distinguish them. In general, the work of cooperative cadres has many achievements, they have worked hard and spent painstaking efforts, and the cooperative members can see it. If there are errors, the cooperative cadres should take the initiative to sincerely conduct self-criticism, earnestly correct them, and show them in actual actions, and truly establish a new style that conforms to the policies of the Party and the People's Government. As long as we do this, we will surely be able to obtain the understanding and welcome of the masses, the cooperative cadres and the cooperative members will be able to unite more closely, the agricultural cooperatives that were originally well-run will certainly be able to be run even better, and even the agricultural cooperatives that were originally not well-run will certainly be able to be run well.

From the perspective of higher-level leaders, when carrying out this work, we must first do a good job of preparation, so that both the cooperative cadres and the cooperative members clearly understand that the purpose of doing this is to improve the work and to unite the cadres and the masses. Of course, individual cases of corruption with solid evidence should be dealt with; however, we must also earnestly grasp the policy of ideological education, learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and curing diseases to save people. In general, agricultural production cooperatives, under the conditions that need to concentrate their efforts on spring plowing at present, do not need to take the form of a "movement" to carry out this work; instead, they should permeate the economic democracy of agricultural cooperatives in daily work, make it regular, institutionalized, and gradually become a rule and a habit of agricultural cooperatives.

### 农业社必须公开财政

    农业社必须公开财政
    中共中央最近发出的关于民主办社几个事项的通知，把按时公开财政收支情况列为坚持民主办社方针的一个主要事项。
    不难想像，社员对于社里的财政收支情况是非常关心的。这同他们的切身利益密切相关。他们不能不关心社里的公共财产，关心公款公物的用途，关心自己的劳动报酬，等等。不应该把社员的这种关心看成社干部办事的一种困难；恰恰相反，应该把这种关心看成是办好农业社的非常重要的条件。
    昨天本报发表了一条消息：四川郫县（在成都西北，郫音皮）四百多个农业社最近公开了社的账目，使社员群众极为兴奋，办社和劳动的积极性大为提高。这个消息说明，一旦在经济管理工作上，特别是财务管理工作上，认真地实行了民主的原则，对于巩固农业社、办好农业社会起多么大的好作用。
    有些社的部分社员劳动积极性还不够高，有些社的少数社员要求退社，这并不是由于合作社制度本身不好。合作社制度的优越性，是大家都看得见的。发生这些不好的情况的原因是多种多样的：有的是由于一部分缺少劳动力的富裕中农暂时减少了一些收入；有的是因为去年受灾而发生了一些困难；有的是由于干部在办社之初缺乏经验，有些措施不当而引起某些不满。但是，相当重要的原因之一是这些社的财务工作混乱不清；或者财务工作本身并没有什么毛病，却没有按时公布账目，因而社员对社内财务情况不了解，心里有疑问。解决这类问题的一个好办法就是公开财政。这也是我们在郫县的消息里可以看得十分清楚的。
    今后各个农业社应该采用中共中央的通知中提出的办法：把各项财政收支都按时公布，让全体社员知道，由群众参加评议。多少时候公布一次？那要看各地各社的具体情况。一般地说，农业生产的收支分配情况，应该按作物的不同，分季公布；季节性的副业收入，也要按季公布；成宗的副业收入、各种专款（国家贷款、农产品预购款、救济款等）、比较大的基本建设费用的支出、社员的投资等，都应该随时公布；社员（包括社干部）所得的劳动日至少每月公布一次，也可以十天或半月公布一次。支出款项、动用物资，不应该只是在用过了以后才公布。在动用之前，就应该先同社员商议：需要不需要动用；哪些方面先用，哪些方面后用。即使确实需要用，如果多数社员不同意，也应该暂时不用。全社的和实行财务包干的生产队的年度的财务收支预算，都应该在社员大会或社员代表大会上反复讨论，通过以后由社干部照办。如果情况发生了变化，预算要有重大的更动，同样也要同社员群众商量。全社的财务开支，一年必须有一次总决算，并在年终公布。只有这样，才能使社员安下心来，充分发挥劳动和投资的积极性。也只有这样，才能使社员有效地监督财务工作，使社里有限的财力、物力发挥更大的作用，使财务管理工作不出或少出毛病。
    有些社的财务收支没有完全算清或者没有公布清楚，社员对于这些老账要求清理。这种要求是正当的。只有彻底清理了这些老账，才有利于加强社内团结和发展集体生产。可是，眼看春耕已经开始，如果被这些老账纠缠住，就有耽误春耕大事的危险。该怎么办呢？应该按照各社不同情况和各种不同的问题分别处理。在一般的情况下，能够即时处理而又对当前生产没什么妨碍的，自然应该即时处理；如果牵涉问题很多，一时难以弄清楚，可以向社员讲明：过了春耕大忙季节一定要清理，使社员安心。有些社的情况比较严重，群众意见很大，不清理就会使生产很难进行的，可以一面组织力量进行生产，教育群众不要因此误了生产；一面清理账目，尽快地向社员公布处理办法。无论在哪一种情况下，都应该先把中共中央的通知告诉群众，宣布从今以后一定认真实行财政公开，并且在实际行动中确实照办。
    对于公开财政，有些社干部是有些忧虑的。其实，这完全可以不必。公开了财政，就可以把社里的各项重大经济措施建筑在社员群众拥护的基础上。这样做决不会增加领导的困难，更不会削弱领导的力量；正相反，这样做才会使领导更有力量。
    许多地方整党整社的结果都证明了：群众的眼睛是明亮的，是能够辨别是非的。财务工作的缺点和错误的性质、轻重各不相同，群众也能够加以辨别。一般社干部的工作是有很多成绩的，他们受了辛劳，费了苦心，社员群众是看得见的。如果有了错误，社干部就应该主动地诚恳地进行自我批评，切实改正，并且在实际行动中表现出来，真正地树立合乎党和人民政府的方针的新作风。只要这样做，就一定能够得到群众的谅解和欢迎，社干部和社员群众就能够进一步亲密团结，原来办得好的农业社就一定能够办得更好，即使原来办得不好的农业社也一定能够办好起来。
    从上级领导方面来说，在进行这项工作的时候，一定要先做好准备工作，要使社干部和社员都明确地了解这样做的目的是为的改进工作，为的干部和群众的团结。对于极个别的有真凭实据的贪污事件当然要加以处理；但是，也要切实掌握思想教育、惩前毖后、治病救人的方针。一般的农业生产合作社，在目前需要集中力量进行春耕的条件下，可以不必采取“运动”的形式进行这个工作；而应该把农业社的经济民主贯串在日常工作中，使它经常化、制度化，逐渐成为农业社办事的一条准则和一种习惯。
