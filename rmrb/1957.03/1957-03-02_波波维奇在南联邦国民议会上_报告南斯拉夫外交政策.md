Xinhua News Agency, 28th. According to the Yugoslav News Agency, the Yugoslav State Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Popović, reiterated at the Federal People's Assembly meeting on the 26th that Yugoslavia hopes to cooperate with all countries (regardless of which bloc these countries participate in or their domestic organization), thereby unswervingly pursuing a policy of active peaceful coexistence and maintaining world peace. He added that such cooperation can only develop on the basis of complete equality, respect for independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs.

Speaking of Yugoslavia's relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, he said that after a period of normalizing these relations, they have deteriorated again. He believes that differences of an ideological nature and Yugoslavia's opposition to joining blocs should not be an obstacle to these countries developing normal international relations with Yugoslavia. He said that recently, the economic agreement signed between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union has encountered unexpected difficulties in its implementation. In this regard, he expressed disagreement with the Soviet government's proposal to postpone the implementation of the date for Soviet funding of aluminum production in Yugoslavia. Despite this, he said, the Yugoslav government will continue to strive to develop increasingly broad and fruitful relations with the Soviet Union and all Eastern European countries. In its relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, the Yugoslav government will take the principles established in the declarations signed by the Soviet and Yugoslav governments in Belgrade and Moscow as a guide.

Regarding relations with Western countries, Popović said: Difficulties also often arise in this area. These difficulties often arise due to a lack of understanding of Yugoslavia's position of not participating in any bloc and suspicion of its independent policy. He hopes that Yugoslavia's relations with Western countries will continue to develop normally and expressed Yugoslavia's willingness to further develop this relationship.

Popović mentioned that last year, the Yugoslav government continued to develop and expand political, economic, cultural, and other relations with many countries. Particular attention was paid to the development of relations with neighboring countries, especially the development and strengthening of relations with friendly Greece, and the continued favorable development of relations with Italy and Austria.

Popović said that Yugoslavia's relations with other European countries and with the United States, especially in the area of bilateral economic cooperation, have developed smoothly. He recalled that the issue of President Tito's planned visit to the United States in the first half of this year has been studied together with the U.S. government. He said that we regret that, due to well-known reasons that were not determined by us, this visit, which would have been beneficial to both parties, was not successfully arranged.

He said that Yugoslavia has good relations with most countries in South America. He also pointed out the significance of the Yugoslav government's understanding and cooperation with the governments of Asian and African countries. He added that last year, Yugoslavia's relations with the People's Republic of China have greatly developed.

When talking about the activities of the Yugoslav delegation at the United Nations General Assembly, Popović pointed out that all the proposals it put forward to resolve the Suez Canal crisis, the Hungarian issue, the Algerian issue, and other current international issues were aimed at peacefully resolving these disputes, strengthening international cooperation, and maintaining world peace. He expressed his conviction that the world will return to a policy of active coexistence and to the path of resolving disputes through peaceful means. Regarding this point, he mentioned the Soviet Union's recent initiative to adjust relations with West Germany, the statement made by US President Eisenhower, and the report by former Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov at the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting on the Soviet Union's adherence to a policy of peaceful coexistence, considering these as signs of improvement in the international situation.

When talking about the situation in the Middle East, Popović said that Israel's refusal to implement the United Nations resolution requiring Israel to withdraw its troops can only complicate the situation. He said that it is unacceptable to use benefits obtained through violence and to use resolving other issues as a condition for fulfilling this international obligation. After the withdrawal of Israeli troops, other issues should be resolved in a constructive manner.

Popović also stated that the Yugoslav government will continue to support the efforts of the United Nations to safeguard world peace.

    波波维奇在南联邦国民议会上
    报告南斯拉夫外交政策
    新华社28日讯  据南斯拉夫通讯社报道：南斯拉夫外交国务秘书长波波维奇26日在联邦国民议会会议上再度强调南斯拉夫希望同一切国家合作（不管这些国家参加什么集团，它们的国内组织如何），从而坚持不渝地奉行积极的和平共处和维护世界和平的政策。他又说，可以理解，这样的合作只有在完全平等、尊重独立和主权，以及不干涉内政的情况下才能发展。
    在谈到南斯拉夫同苏联和东欧国家的关系时，他说，在经过使这些关系正常的时期以后，这些关系又恶化了。他认为，观念形态性质的分歧和南斯拉夫的反对参加集团的态度不应该成为这些国家同南斯拉夫发展正常的国际关系的障碍。他说，最近，南斯拉夫同苏联签订的经济协定在执行中遇到了意外的困难。在这方面，他表示不同意苏联政府建议延期实施由苏联资助南斯拉夫生产铝的日子。他说，尽管这样，南斯拉夫政府将继续努力，争取同苏联和一切东欧国家发展日益广泛和日益富有成果的关系。在它同苏联和东欧国家的关系方面，南斯拉夫政府将以苏南两国政府在贝尔格莱德和莫斯科签署的宣言中确定的原则作为指针。
    谈到同西方国家的关系，波波维奇说：在这一方面，也是时常发生困难，这种困难之所以发生，往往是由于对于南斯拉夫所采取的不参加任何集团的那种立场缺乏了解，对于它的独立的政策有所怀疑。他希望南斯拉夫同西方国家的关系继续正常地发展，并且表示南斯拉夫愿意进一步发展这种关系。
    波波维奇提到，去年，南斯拉夫政府继续发展和扩大同许多国家的政治、经济、文化和其他关系。去年特别注意同邻国关系的发展，特别是发展和加强了同友好的希腊的关系，并且还继续有利地发展了同意大利和奥地利的关系。
    波波维奇说，南斯拉夫同其他欧洲国家以及同美国的关系，特别是在双边经济合作方面的关系得到了顺利的发展。他追述，关于铁托总统打算在今年上半年访问美国的问题已经同美国政府一道加以研究。他说，我们感到遗憾的是，由于并不决定于我们的大家知道的原因，这次对双方都有利的访问没有能够安排成功。
    他说，南斯拉夫同南美洲大多数国家的关系都很好。他也指出南斯拉夫政府同亚非国家的政府的谅解与合作的意义。他又说，去年，南斯拉夫同中华人民共和国的关系有了很大的发展。
    波波维奇在谈到南斯拉夫代表团在联合国大会上的活动时指出，它为了解决苏伊士运河危机、匈牙利问题、阿尔及利亚问题和当前其他国际问题而提出的一切提案，都是以和平解决这些争端、加强国际合作和维持世界和平为目的的。他表示确信世界会回到积极共处的政策上来，回到以和平方法解决争执中的问题的道路上来。关于这一点，他谈到了苏联最近所提出的同西德调整关系的那种倡议、美国总统艾森豪威尔所发表的声明以及前苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上所提出的关于苏联坚持和平共处政策的报告，认为这些都是表明国际局势好转的迹象。
    在谈到中东形势的时候，波波维奇说，以色列拒绝执行联合国要以色列撤军的决议的做法只能使形势复杂化。他说，利用暴力得来的好处，以先解决其他问题作为履行这个国际义务的条件，这种做法是令人不能接受的。在以色列军队撤退以后，应该以建设性的态度解决其他问题。
    波波维奇还表示，南斯拉夫政府将继续支持联合国组织的努力，来保障世界和平。
