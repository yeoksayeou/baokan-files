    The United States Intensifies Conspiracy Activities to Control Taiwan
    In recent months, many facts have shown that the United States is increasingly intensifying its military control over Taiwan. In October last year, the United States announced the removal of Ingersoll from his concurrent position as Commander of the Seventh Fleet, and appointed him as Commander of the U.S. Taiwan Defense Command to uniformly command the U.S. military and Kuomintang troops in the Taiwan area. At the same time, the authority of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan was also expanded, allowing it to be fully responsible for handling military aid allocated to Taiwan. In January of this year, U.S. Far East Commander Lemnitzer also rushed to Taiwan, held secret talks with the Taiwan Kuomintang authorities, and inspected the U.S. military deployment in the Taiwan area. Subsequently, there were reports that the United States planned to set up Matador missiles in Taiwan and was preparing to transfer the squadron operating these missiles to Taiwan. The United States also decided to allocate 25 million U.S. dollars to build a large new airport in central Taiwan as a base for the largest U.S. strategic bombers.
    These activities of the United States in Taiwan are obviously to further intensify its armed occupation and military control over Taiwan, in order to prevent the Chinese people from peacefully liberating their territory of Taiwan. Not long ago, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Murphy stated without concealment that it "is not in the U.S. national interest not to defend Taiwan." For this "reason," the United States is determined to strengthen both its own military power in Taiwan and its control over the Taiwan Kuomintang army, to have them serve and die under U.S. command to "defend" U.S. "interests."
    The above situation proves once again that the so-called "renunciation of the use of force" argument that the United States has repeatedly chanted in the Sino-U.S. talks is nothing more than a trick with ulterior motives and deception. In reality, it is the United States that has used force to occupy our territory of Taiwan, and it is the United States that is constantly intensifying its military activities there, even putting on a warlike posture. The United States attempts to occupy our territory of Taiwan by force for a long time and to carry out military threats against our country, which is the main source of tension in Asia.
    The occupation and enslavement of Taiwan by the United States has brought great pain and endless disasters to the Taiwan compatriots, and has also brought serious threats to peace and security in Asia. It is a blatant act of aggression for the United States to use Chinese land to "defend" its "interests." Every Chinese person cannot tolerate the trampling of our rivers and mountains of Taiwan by American artillery, and cannot tolerate the American bloodsuckers exploiting the blood, sweat, and resources of our Taiwan compatriots. The Taiwan issue is an internal matter for us Chinese and absolutely does not allow Americans to interfere. In order to realize the complete unification and independence of their motherland, the Chinese people will accomplish this sacred historical task in the way they are willing to take. This is something that no force in the world can stop.

### 美国加紧控制台湾的阴谋活动

    美国加紧控制台湾的阴谋活动
    近几个月来，有许多事实表明美国正在日益加紧它对台湾的军事控制。去年10月，美国宣布解除英格索尔原任第七舰队司令的兼职，派他专任美军协防台湾司令部司令，统一指挥台湾地区的美军和国民党军队。同时，美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团的权力也扩大了，可以完全负责处理拨交台湾的军事援助。今年1月，美国远东军司令兰尼兹尔又匆匆来到台湾，同台湾国民党当局进行了秘密会谈，并视察了美国在台湾地区的军事布署。接着，又有消息说，美国图谋在台湾设置斗牛士式导弹，并准备把操纵这种导弹的联队调往台湾。美国还决定拨款二千五百万美元在台湾中部新建一个大飞机场，作为美国最大的战略轰炸机的基地。
    美国在台湾的这些活动，很明显是要进一步加紧它对台湾的武装占领和军事控制，以阻挠中国人民和平解放自己的领土台湾。不久以前，美国国务卿帮办墨菲毫不掩饰地声称：美国“不保卫台湾是不符合美国的国家利益的”。就是为了这个“理由”，美国决心一方面加强它自己在台湾的军事力量，一方面加强对台湾国民党军队的控制，要他们在美国的指挥下为“保卫”美国的“利益”而卖命。
    上述情况又一次证明，美国在中美会谈中曾经一再高唱的所谓“放弃使用武力”的论调，不过是别有用心和骗人的鬼话。实际上，是美国使用了武力侵占着我国的领土台湾，是美国在那里不断加紧军事活动，甚至摆出一种好战的姿态。美国企图长期用武力霸占我国的领土台湾，并对我国进行武力威胁，这是亚洲紧张局势的主要根源。
    美国对台湾的占领和奴役，给台湾同胞带来了极大的痛苦和无穷的灾难，也给亚洲的和平和安全带来了严重的威胁。美国以中国的土地来“保卫”它的“利益”，这是明目张胆的侵略行为。每一个中国人都不能容忍美国的炮车在蹂躏我们台湾的河山，不能容忍美国的吸血者在榨取我们台湾同胞的血汗和资源。台湾问题是我们中国人内部的事情，绝对不许美国人来干涉。中国人民为了争取实现自己祖国的完全统一和独立，将按照自己所愿意采取的方式来完成这一神圣的历史任务。这是世界上任何力量都阻挡不了的。
