Expanding the Number of Nurses, Improving the Quality of Nurses
Lin Sixin's Speech

　　I listened to Chairman Mao's report at the Supreme State Conference with great excitement. I wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao's instructions and the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong.

　　In the past eight years, thanks to the deep concern and education of the Party and the government for nursing work, the ranks of nursing staff have grown compared to before liberation. They have played a certain role in the socialist construction of the motherland, but there are still many problems in the work of nurses: such as organizational leadership issues, nurse education issues, teacher issues, and living conditions issues, etc. The nurse problem has attracted the attention of leaders at all levels of the health department. At the end of June 1956, the Ministry of Health organized a force to conduct in-depth research on the issue of nurses. After half a year of research, it finally drafted the "Instructions on Improving Nursing Work" and distributed it to relevant units for discussion. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party, our problems will be solved. Today I want to talk about three issues.

　　One, Nurse Training Issues

　　Currently, the quality and quantity of nurses are far from meeting the objective needs. We are now adopting a centralized approach to train young nurses, which can train a large number of them and save equipment and teachers. However, it also brings some new problems. The first is the difficulty in enrollment. Every year, the number of applicants for nursing schools is insufficient, and it is rare to complete the task at once. It becomes even more problematic to recruit a large number of students. The second is the issue of insufficient internship bases, which affects teaching and production internships. For example, Zunyi Nursing School in Guizhou has eight hundred students, but the internship hospital only has one hundred and fifty beds. The three nursing schools in Beijing also have the same difficulties. This kind of training method cannot guarantee the quality of students.

　　In the past, we did not train nurses in a planned way according to work needs. At the same time, we selected experienced and outstanding workers from the nurses to study specialized medicine. This not only weakened the ranks of nurses, but also failed to solve the problem of physician shortage. Some hospitals in Beijing cannot open all wards due to insufficient nurses; some nursing schools have to give up production internships in other departments to support the opening of wards in specialized hospitals, so that students cannot get comprehensive internship opportunities. The situation of nurse shortage is even more serious in other regions. China has a population of 600 million and needs more than 2 million nurses, but our current number of nurses is less than 200,000, which is a serious situation.

　　Nursing work is part of medical science. Nurses must master relevant nursing scientific theories and technologies in order to cooperate with the development of medical science. However, the quality of nursing work is not high now, so nurses must actively advance towards science. The so-called advancement is not to detach from practical work, spend all day in the library, or bring math and physics textbooks to the ward, but to gradually improve their professional level in their positions. Although nursing work is ordinary, there are many problems that need to be studied. Good nursing work must be based on scientific theory, combined with the different needs of each patient, and expressed through a series of practical operations and actions. It is not an accumulation of mechanical actions. Therefore, improving nurse education is still necessary. Public health nurses have played a significant role in implementing the policy of prevention first. Now more of these nurses are needed to work, so we should consider restoring the training of public health nurses. Advancing towards science requires nurses' subjective efforts, but it also requires assistance and support from all parties, especially hospital leaders and physicians.

　　Two, Increasing Production and Practicing Economy

　　Responding to the call of the Party and the government to increase production and practice economy, there is much we nurses can do, such as the application of dressings, medicines, and instruments. We should save as much as possible without violating medical principles; these can be calculated. But if we are careless in our work, it will cause incalculable losses and delay the patient's recovery, which is worth our vigilance.

　　Some unit leaders now do not have enough grasp of the spirit of economy, do not deeply understand and analyze the situation, but simply tighten staffing to complete the task, resulting in work losses and greater waste. For example, if there are not enough nurses in the ward, and orderlies are laid off, the nurses have to be busy with administrative and cleaning work, so that patients do not get the care they deserve, prolonging the length of stay, delaying production, and affecting the bed turnover rate. Due to the heavy workload, the incidence of miscarriage, premature birth, and chronic diseases among nurses is increasing. Most hospitals do not have reserve personnel in the nursing staff establishment. When someone takes sick leave or maternity leave, their work is borne by other nurses in the ward, and overtime is no longer an occasional occurrence. As a result, one batch recovers, and another batch gets sick, forming a vicious cycle. Taking Beijing People's Hospital as an example, there are 159 nursing staff, and the number of absent days in 1956 alone was as high as 5,990 days, with an absenteeism rate of 12.5%. Calculated according to 307 working days per person per year (excluding 52 Sundays and 7 statutory holidays), the daily average is 19.5 people absent. This situation is quite common in various hospitals.

　　Three, Publicly Funded Medical Care Issues

　　Publicly funded medical care is a superior system under the socialist system to protect people's health. However, due to the incorrect understanding of this system by some cadres, some problems have also been found in its implementation. For example, some people go to several hospitals for comparison, take a lot of medicine and do not eat it (some even tear off the bottle labels, leave the medicine at the clinic, and leave; some take the medicine back but do not eat it themselves, and give it to relatives and friends who do not have publicly funded medical care), insist on being hospitalized even if they do not need to be, refuse to be discharged after they are cured, insist on buying imported and expensive medicines for incurable diseases, and insist on getting sick leave certificates even if they can work, causing great waste, and the time medical staff spend on explaining and persuading is also considerable. I will only cite one example. In the Henan Provincial Tuberculosis Hospital, a doctor was pushed off the third floor by a patient in order to persuade the patient to be discharged, causing a pelvic fracture and paraplegia. In order to avoid trouble, some doctors unconditionally accommodate patients. All of the above have brought great losses to the country.

　　Four, Four Suggestions

　　In response to the above problems, I would like to put forward some immature opinions for reference.

　　1. At present, nurses are extremely scarce, and nursing schools have had difficulties in enrollment in previous years. This summer, a large number of junior high school graduates will not be able to continue their studies. Can we run schools diligently and frugally under the principle of "more, faster, better, and more economical," expand the enrollment of nursing schools, gradually solve the problem of insufficient number of nurses, and train nurses in a planned way every year according to the needs of medical science development? In addition to training in existing nursing schools, small-scale nursing schools can be set up near comprehensive hospitals with conditions to solve the problems of teaching and production internships.

　　2. According to the principle that the faculty of secondary vocational schools should be held by senior personnel and the current situation that the number of professional course teachers in nursing schools is insufficient, the quality is not high, and the faculty will be even more insufficient after expanding enrollment, nursing departments can be established in medical colleges with conditions. This can solve the problem of teachers in secondary nursing schools and the problem of improving secondary nurses and the enrollment of some high school graduates. Higher education for nurses is related to the cooperation of nursing and medical science. If there is no higher education institution for nurses, it will be difficult for the nursing profession to develop and improve.

　　3. Regarding the issue of saving manpower, it is hoped that a committee (including administrative, personnel, and business personnel) can be organized to conduct in-depth investigations and research in various units, seek truth from facts, and reasonably propose a plan to streamline the establishment. Consideration should be given to the nature of the hospital (teaching hospital, comprehensive hospital, sanatorium, and research hospital) and the characteristics of women.

　　4. Regarding the issue of publicly funded medical care, it is hoped that various units will strengthen the political and ideological education of cadres, correct their attitude towards publicly funded medical care, and everyone should cherish state property and use the funds for publicly funded medical care economically. It is also recommended that the health department organize a committee to further study the specific methods of publicly funded medical care. (Attached picture)

### 扩大护士数量　提高护士质量　林斯馨的发言

　　扩大护士数量　提高护士质量
　　林斯馨的发言
    我以十分兴奋的心情听了毛主席在最高国务会议上的报告，我衷心拥护毛主席的指示，拥护周总理、李富春副总理和陈叔通副主席的报告。
    八年来由于党和政府对护理工作的深切关怀和教育，护理人员的队伍较解放前已有所增长，她们在祖国的社会主义建设事业中起了一定的作用，但是护士工作中仍存在着许多问题：如组织领导问题、护士教育问题、师资问题和生活待遇问题等等。护士问题已引起卫生部门各级领导的重视。卫生部于1956年6月底组织了力量对护士问题进行深入的研究，经过了半年的研究，终于拟出“关于改进护士工作指示”草案发给有关单位讨论。我们深信在共产党的领导下，我们的问题会得到解决的。今天我要谈三个问题。
        一、护士培养问题
    目前护士在质量上和数量上远远跟不上客观的需要，我们现在是采取集中方式来培养青年护士的，这样可以大量培养，同时可以节省设备和教师。但是也带来一些新问题。首先是招生困难问题。护校招生，年年投考的数量都不够，很少一次可以完成任务的，如收大批学生，更成问题。其次是实习基地不够问题，这样影响了教学实习和生产实习。例如贵州遵义护士学校有八百学生，而实习医院仅有一百五十床位，北京市三个护士学校也有同样的困难。这样的训练法，就不能保证学生的质量。
    过去我们培养护士，并没有按照工作需要作有计划的培养，同时又把护士中有经验的和优秀的工作者选拔学习专科医师。这样非但削弱了护士的队伍，也未解决医师缺乏的问题。北京市就有医院因为护士不够，不能将全部病房开放；有的护士学校为了支援专科医院开病房而不得不放弃了其他各科的生产实习，使学生不能得到全面的实习机会。其他地区缺少护士的情况就更严重。中国有六亿人口，需要护士二百万以上，而我们现在护士的数目不及二十万，这种情形是严重的。
    护理工作是医学科学的一部分，护士必须掌握有关护理的科学理论与技术，才能配合医学科学的发展。但现在护理工作的质量是不高的，因此护士必须积极向科学进军。所谓进军，并非脱离实际工作，整天钻到图书馆去，或是带了数理化课本到病房去，而是在本岗位上把业务水平逐步提高。护理工作虽然平凡，但需要研究的问题很多，好的护理工作必须以科学的理论为基础，结合每个病人的不同需要，通过一系列的实际操作和行动表达出来，它并不是机械动作的累积。因此提高护士教育还是必要的。在贯彻预防为主的方针上公共卫生护士起了很大的作用。现在需要更多这类的护士去工作，因此应当考虑恢复公共卫生护士的培养。向科学进军是需要护士们主观努力的，同时也需要各方面、尤其是需要医院领导同志和医师们给予帮助和支持。
        二、增产节约问题
    响应党和政府增产节约的号召，我们护士有许多可做的，如敷料、药品和器械的应用，在不违背医疗原则的情况下，应当尽量节省；这些是可以计算出来的。但如果我们工作粗枝大叶，就会造成难以估计的损失，延误病人的康复，这是值得我们警惕的。
    现在有的单位领导对节约精神掌握不够，不深入了解和分析情况，只是为了完成任务而紧缩编制，以致工作遭受损失，造成更大的浪费。例如病房护士本来不够，又精简工友，护士就不得不忙于事务和清洁工作，而使病人得不到应有的护理，延长了住院日期，耽误了生产，还影响了病床周转率。由于工作的担负过重，在护士中自然流产、早产和慢性病的发病率日益增多。大多数的医院，护理人员编制中没有机动人员，遇有人请病假或产假时，她们的工作则由本病房其他的护理人员负担，加班加点已经不是偶尔的事了，于是往往一批好了，一批又病，形成恶性循环。就北京人民医院一个单位来说，有一百五十九个护理人员，在1956年一年中的缺勤
  日数就有五千九百九十日之多，缺勤率占
  12.5％，每人每年按三百零七个工作日（除去五十二个星期日和七个法定的假日）计算，则每日平均缺十九点五人。这样情况在各医院里是相当普遍的。
        三、公费医疗问题
    公费医疗是社会主义制度下保障人民健康的优越制度。但由于有些干部对于这个制度有不正确的认识，所以在实行中也发现了一些问题。例如有的人看病要连去几个医院以作比较，拿了很多药不吃（有人竟将瓶签撕去，药留在门诊处走了，有的人把药取回去自己不吃，送给没有公费医疗的亲友吃），不需要住院的一定要求住院，病好了不肯出院，不治之症一定要求买进口的贵重药，可以工作的闹着要开病假证明等，造成了很大的浪费，医务人员用在解释和说服工作上的时间也极可观。我只举一个事例，如河南省结核病院有一位医师为了动员病人出院，被该病员推下三层楼，造成骨盆骨折和截瘫。医生们为了避免麻烦，有的就无原则的迁就病人。以上种种，给国家带来了很大损失。
          四、四项建议
    针对上面一些问题，我想提出一些不成熟的意见供参考。
    一、目前护士极为缺少，历年护校招生都有困难，而今夏适有大批初中毕业生不能升学，是否可在“又多、又快、又好、又省”的原则下勤俭办学，扩大护士学校的招生数目，以逐步解决护士数量不足的问题，并按医学科学发展的需要，每年有计划地培养护士。除去在已有的护士学校培养外，在有条件的综合性医院附近设立小规模护士学校，以解决教学和生产实习问题。
    二、根据高教部中级专业学校师资应由高级人员担任的原则和目前护校专业课师资数量不足、质量不高以及扩大招生后师资将更感不足的情况，在有条件的医学院校办护理系，这一方面可解决中级护校的师资问题，同时也可解决中级护士提高和部分高中毕业生的升学问题。护士的高等教育关系着护理事业与医学科学的相配合，如果没有护士的高等教育机构，而要护士专业发展和提高，是有困难的。
    三、关于节约人力问题，希能组织一个委员会（包括行政、人事、业务人员），深入各单位调查研究，实事求是，合理地提出精简编制的计划。按照医院的性质（教学医院、综合性医院、疗养院和研究医院）和妇女的特点加以考虑。
    四、关于公费医疗问题，希望各单位加强对干部的政治思想教育，端正对公费医疗的态度，大家要爱护国家的财产，节约使用公费医疗的经费。并建议卫生部门组织委员会对公费医疗的具体办法作进一步的研究。（附图片）
