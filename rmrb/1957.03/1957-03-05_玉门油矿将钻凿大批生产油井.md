Xinhua News Agency Report: Yumen Oilfield will continue to drill a large number of production wells in the Laojunmiao and Shiyougou oilfields this year. It will also adopt large-scale methods of injecting water and gas into the oilfields to increase oil formation pressure and increase crude oil production. Some advanced technologies and experiences in increasing crude oil production last year, such as acidification, fracturing, and extending the wax removal cycle, will continue to be promoted in depth this year.

In terms of petroleum geological exploration, this year, exploration forces will be concentrated to intensify detailed exploration work in the Ya'erxia and Xiaomalianquan areas of the Jiuquan Basin. In addition, Yumen Oilfield will also strengthen petroleum geological exploration work in the Minle Basin and the Chaoshui Basin this year.

    玉门油矿将钻凿大批生产油井
    据新华社讯  玉门油矿今年将在老君庙、石油沟两油田上继续钻凿大批的生产井，并且大规模地采取向油田内部注水、注气以增加油层压力多产原油的方法采油。去年在增产原油方面的一些先进技术和经验，如酸化、压裂、延长清腊周期等，今年也将继续深入推广。
    在石油地质勘探方面，今年将集中勘探力量，加紧对酒泉盆地的鸭儿峡和小马莲泉地区的详探工作。此外，玉门油矿今年还将加强民乐盆地、潮水盆地的石油地质勘探工作。
