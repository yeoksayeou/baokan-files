We were very honored to personally hear Chairman Mao's twelve brilliant instructions at the Supreme State Conference on February 27th. Each one gave us tremendous inspiration and education. We deeply felt that hearing Chairman Mao speak for one evening was better than reading books for ten years. Chairman Mao spoke for more than four hours, patiently and tirelessly. He personally taught us to distinguish between contradictions among the people, which are issues of right and wrong, and antagonistic contradictions with the enemy, which are of a different nature. He personally taught us working methods: when encountering ideological problems, we should use education and persuasion, and an attitude of helping people and curing diseases, rather than crude administrative methods or means. Chairman Mao also personally taught us the two-point theory: any problem has two sides, good contains bad, bad contains good, good can become bad, and bad can become good. Chairman Mao personally taught us how to view problems dialectically: to see people from their contradictions, and to see progress from development. He taught us to treat all mistakes as lessons learned in the process of self-education. We senior intellectuals in the medical field, especially myself, generally do not put enough effort into political study, and when encountering problems, we often inevitably display purely technical viewpoints. Our common mistakes are all due to our low political level and poor self-cultivation. Therefore, when speaking, we often do not grasp the overall situation, nor do we carefully consider important factors such as time, place, object, and conditions, and we speak out one-sidedly and off the cuff. We, especially myself, must intensify our political study in the future, further transform ourselves, and better serve the people, so as not to fail Chairman Mao's infinite and deep concern for us.

Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction on China's population needing planned birth control has moved all intellectuals in the national medical and health circles. This creative instruction has major political, economic, historical, and international significance. All of us medical workers, together with the people of the whole country, warmly respond to Chairman Mao's call, actively take action, and must do this glorious and great task well.

In the past few years, our medical community has not paid enough attention to the publicity work and specific measures for contraception, and the progress has been very slow. In addition to major hospitals doing some very passive abortions or tubal ligation surgeries, a few women have also been fitted with cervical caps. Occasionally, vasectomies have been performed on men, but generally speaking, birth control work has not been actively carried out. The main reason is ideological problems. It can also be said that this is an inevitable phenomenon of insufficient political study.

Too much and too fast population growth,
Is detrimental to the country and the individual

Why must the Chinese people practice planned birth control? The main reason is that too much and too fast population growth results in extremely important problems that the state cannot but be concerned about: (1) It restricts the improvement of the people's economic and cultural living standards. (2) It hinders a happy and fulfilling family life. (3) It hinders the development of young people's careers. (4) It affects the health and work of young people themselves. (5) It affects the clothing, food, housing, education, culture, and health of future generations. (6) It creates or aggravates the problems of school dropouts and unemployment.

Our country has always had a large population. After liberation, with the general improvement of the living standards of the people across the country, many families have produced many children. According to very incomplete preliminary statistics from various places, our birth rate in recent years has been 35 to 55 per thousand (that is, 35-55 babies are born for every thousand people), averaging about 37 per thousand (equal to 3.7%). Two years ago, the State Council announced that the national population figure was 600 million, and it may now be 630 million. If we calculate based on this number (630 million x 0.037), the number of babies born this year will be 23.31 million (assuming that the nutritional cost for each baby per year is 100 yuan, then the total nutritional cost for babies born in 1957 exceeds 2.3 billion yuan, which is about four times the total number of construction bonds issued each year. As the population increases year by year, this number also increases year by year). The larger the population base each year, the greater the total number of babies born each year. It is as alarming as the rapid accumulation of high-interest compound interest loans. The proverb "one generation two, ten generations a thousand" is based on fact (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1,024).

If the infant mortality rate this year is 30 per thousand, then 696,000 babies will die this year (23.21 million x 0.03 = 696,300). Excluding this mortality figure, the actual increase in the number of babies each year will be 22.613 million. This number is equivalent to the population of two Czechoslovakia, three Hungarys, or four Austrias. If we are to strictly and responsibly welcome more and more newborn children every year, and prepare to provide them with appropriate clothing, food, housing, education, and hygiene, then it is not difficult to imagine the staggering number of midwives, nannies, nurses, doctors, nurseries, kindergartens, primary schools, middle schools, universities, dormitories, teachers, textbooks, various medicines, serums, vaccines, and hospital equipment needed each year. The financial, material, and human resources, and time required for the basic equipment and technical and non-technical cadre training and cultivation of these institutions cannot be fully resolved in the short term. Some people have initially estimated that our country's annual mortality rate is about 17 per thousand. Subtracting the mortality rate of 17 per thousand from the birth rate of 37 per thousand, the actual annual population increase rate will be 20 per thousand (i.e., 2%), but in reality, it may be more than this. Some say that the natural population increase rate is about 3%. Let's assume that it increases by 2% per year. Using the equation (1 + 0.02)n, the increase in population figures will be as shown in Table 1, column 1: The Future Population Figures of China Estimated Based on an Annual Population Increase Rate of 2%-4% (20/1000-40/1000)

| Time  | Population | Time  | Population | Time  | Population |
|-------|------------|-------|------------|-------|------------|
| 1956  | 630 million| 1956  | 630 million| 1956  | 630 million|

| 20 years later| 930 million| 20 years later| 1.14 billion| 18 years later| 1.26 billion|
| 36 years later| 1.26 billion| 24 years later| 1.26 billion| 36 years later| 2.52 billion|
| 72 years later| 2.52 billion| 48 years later| 2.52 billion| 54 years later| 5.04 billion|
| 108 years later| 5.04 billion| 72 years later| 5.04 billion| 72 years later| 10.08 billion|
| 144 years later| 10.08 billion| 96 years later| 10.08 billion| 90 years later| 20.16 billion|
| Calculated by (1+0.02)n |  | Calculated by (1+0.03)n |  | Calculated by (1+0.04)n |  |

According to Vice Premier Li's report, our country can only provide employment opportunities for more than one million employees each year, but the annual population increase rate is 2%-3%. That is to say, if population birth is not restricted, more than 10 million people will appear with nothing to do each year in the future.

Some people say that our country has more than one billion acres of uncultivated land. As long as land reclamation work is done well, it is not necessary to control the population birth figures. This view is one-sided. Land reclamation is an extremely important task in the economic construction of the motherland, but the area of wasteland and the speed of land reclamation are limited. In the first Five-Year Plan, only 70 million acres of wasteland could be reclaimed. In the second and third Five-Year Plans, the speed of land reclamation may be faster, but it is estimated that the current cultivated area in our country is about 1.8 billion acres (calculated based on planting once a year), and the area that may be affected by disasters each year is more than 100 million acres. Then, the actual production area each year is about 1.6 billion acres. Even if the production of the newly reclaimed area is added, it will definitely not satisfactorily adapt to the living materials required by the current population growth rate. Therefore, if the population birth is not restricted, the people's lives, to some extent, will not only not be improved, but may even be lower than they are now.

From the above, it can be seen that irresponsible, unplanned, and unrestricted family blind birth will bring very serious burdens and pressures to the country and all the people. The world's population is still less than 2.6 billion(?), and many countries already feel the tension in the supply of living materials, because people's clothing, food, housing, transportation, education, culture, and health all rely on materials on the earth. The wood used for housing construction and furniture takes decades to grow. Only with good soil, sufficient sunshine, ideal water conservancy, abundant mineral resources, a large amount of fertilizer, insecticides, sufficient time, and socialist scientific management can the people have the opportunity to obtain rich cultural and living materials. The people of our motherland are uniquely endowed by nature, with vast land and abundant resources, and a large population. To a certain extent, the favorable conditions of timing, geography, and human harmony are all available. With more than 4,000 years of ancient culture and a long and glorious history, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, we personally participated in the construction of the motherland, and personally witnessed the transformation of the motherland from a semi-feudal and semi-colonial poor and weak agricultural country with backward science, economy, and culture, into a socialist country with great power, unlimited bright prospects, and vigor, encouraging all of us Chinese people to always advance under the victorious banner of Chairman Mao.

In order to build the motherland, and in order to improve the clothing, food, housing, education, culture, and lives of all the people, what should the population figure of China be controlled within for it to be reasonable? What is the maximum limit for the number of newborn babies each year? These all need further investigation and research to give a final answer. But it is certain that China's population is currently increasing too fast and too much.

Recently, a medical professor from the German Democratic Republic told me that the population of East Germany is controlled at an average of 2.7 people per family. That is, only seven children are born for every ten couples. This still results in some population increase each year, which they consider satisfactory, because if the average population per family increases to 3.0, their living standards will be greatly and adversely affected. If the average population per family is 2.5, the German population will neither increase nor decrease, and can maintain balance. These figures are for reference only. As for the population of our China, it seems that it would be possible to control the number of births each year at about 17 per thousand for the time being, but it must be pointed out that due to the Party Central Committee's decision on the periodic elimination of diseases, the progress of medical and health work, and the continuous improvement of people's living and cultural standards, there are fewer and fewer diseases, and the lifespan of the elderly is also getting longer and longer. China's total annual number of deaths may soon drop to below 17 per thousand in the future. At that time, China's birth rate must have a corresponding and stricter control, otherwise we will still face the serious problem of the population increasing too much and too fast.

Some people have made preliminary estimates that if we supply the country's production to the lives of 500 million people, then there will be ample food and clothing. China's population cannot be reduced to 500 million, so only birth control is possible. If we control the population within 700 million within fifteen years and actively complete the motherland's economic construction plan, then in 1972, the people of the whole country can obtain a happy life with ample food and clothing. The key lies in whether the young and middle-aged people can wholeheartedly respond to and implement Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction on planned population birth control. There is no doubt that under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have the determination and confidence to complete this glorious task entrusted to us by Chairman Mao, which has top political significance. We medical workers are willing to contribute all our strength under the leadership of the Central Birth Control Committee, which will soon be established, and devote ourselves to this complex and arduous great work until victory is achieved.

As for Malthus' theory of solving the problem of overpopulation through war, plague, and disease, it is wrong and reactionary. Because imperialist, colonialist, and reactionary forces have always used this reactionary theory to carry out aggression and squeeze out weak nations and backward countries, this is what we should resolutely oppose. But according to my superficial understanding (if there are any errors, please criticize), Malthus' observation that population reproduction (if not controlled) increases at a geometric rate is correct. In economically and scientifically backward countries, under certain circumstances, the rate of increase in industrial and agricultural production is arithmetic, not as fast as geometric, which also seems to be reasonable. Regarding the population and land issue, the actual situations of China and the Soviet Union are completely different. China's population is about twice as large as the Soviet Union's, but China's land area is more than half the size of the Soviet Union's. China's economic, cultural, scientific, and industrial and agricultural production methods have made a lot of progress after liberation, but basically they are still quite backward. The Soviet Union has won its revolution for forty years, and its economy, science, culture, and industrial and agricultural production have all reached the world's advanced level. The Soviet Union's population is not large enough, the base is three times smaller, and the annual increase rate is also smaller and slower, so it adopts a policy of encouraging population increase. China's population base is very large, and the current increase rate is too fast and too much, so we should dialectically adopt a policy of planned birth control in order to accumulate a large amount of funds to ensure the early and victorious completion of socialist construction.

Facts have proved that having more births has a certain adverse effect on women's health and longevity, because during the process of childbirth, a small number of pregnant women inevitably have dystocia, accidental bleeding, pregnancy poisoning, uterine fibroids, nephritis, heart failure, and other complications. At the same time, according to statistics, most malignant tumors of the uterus and cervix occur in women with more births. Virgins or women who have not given birth rarely get this disease.

Oppose early marriage, support late marriage

Early marriage is harmful. The marriage age should be around 25-30 years old. Early marriage is harmful in terms of physiology, clinical aspects, career prospects, and the health and welfare of the next generation. Young people generally have weak knowledge, experience, work ability, and economic strength before the age of 30. They should not fall in love or get married too early. They should concentrate their efforts, study hard, work hard, and bury themselves in hard work to build a good foundation for their lifelong career prospects. The ancients said, "The plan for the year lies in the spring, and the plan for life lies in youth," "If you don't work hard when you're young, you'll only regret it when you're old."

The marriage age stipulated by the Marriage Law is the minimum, not to encourage people to marry at this age. Young people who have just turned 18 have begun to complete the development of their reproductive organs, but their physical development has not yet reached maturity. Therefore, early marriage has adverse effects on the health of young people and the health and physique of the next generation. The harm of early marriage and early childbirth for women is very obvious. For example, according to the clinical medical record statistics of obstetrics and gynecology, the incidence of dystocia is the highest before the age of 22. The younger the age, the higher the dystocia rate. Therefore, the most suitable marriage age for women should be around 25 to 30 years old. The age at which men's sexual desire declines is later than that of women, so the marriage age for men can be older than that of women. Some people think that the pelvic joints of women harden at the age of 25. This is unfounded. There are many female doctors and other women in large cities such as Beijing and Shanghai who only get married after the age of 28-30, and are already over 30 when they give birth to their first child, but there is no difficulty. I think that from the medical point of view and the interests of young people themselves and the next generation, we should consider revising the minimum marriage age stipulated by the Marriage Law to 24 years old for women and 28 years old for men (ethnic minority areas are not subject to this restriction).

Due to the various difficulties caused by early marriage to families and young people, many young people with low cultural levels or weak wills fall in love and get married early when they should be concentrating on studying culture and business. They have many children before the age of 25. Young parents lack experience, insufficient economic conditions, and neglect the nutrition, health, and education of their children. It is cruel and wrong to treat their children like this. Many of these young parents with many children often even lose the self-respect that socialist masters should have, who are paid according to their work, are economically independent, and rely solely on the organization to ask for more subsidies for many children, family hardship subsidies, etc. Although the organization is very caring and does its best to provide assistance, there is not enough porridge for everyone, and it may not be able to meet all requirements. Therefore, many people complain that the organization does not take care of them enough, make trouble, and are not active in their work. These difficulties are all caused by young people being irresponsible and getting married too early. For the benefit of all the people, we should oppose early marriage, advocate late marriage, and break the feudal ideas of having many children and the male chauvinistic idea of preferring sons to daughters. We should attach importance to ideological education and extensive and in-depth publicity. There are already many birth control methods that can be adopted. Birth control work should first be implemented by senior leaders, intellectuals, and cadres, but the main targets are actually the young and middle-aged workers and peasants in factories, mines, and rural areas. The masses in factories, mines, and rural areas alone account for more than 90% of the country's population. Therefore, in order to achieve the goal of birth control, we must carry out systematic, organized, in-depth, and extensive publicity and education work to break the feudal ideas such as "There are three unfilial acts, the greatest of which is having no descendants," "Having a son solves all problems," "Having many children and grandchildren," "Preferring sons to daughters," and "Must have a son."

We should explain the harm of early marriage, and should oppose early marriage and support late marriage. Women who marry late, or men and women who are determined not to marry for the people's cause, should not be discriminated against but should be highly admired by the society and the masses.

It is extremely unfair to put the serious burden of birth control work entirely on women.

Until now, most people have put the serious burden of birth control work, which has major political and economic significance, almost entirely on women. This is extremely unfair and wrong. In terms of sexual life, most of the initiative and demands come from men, and women are mostly passive. It is unfair to put the trouble, pain, and possible complications of women undergoing abortions, curettage, and tubal ligation after pregnancy for work and birth control purposes on women. We should adopt a policy of prevention first. Men should wear condoms or have vasectomies (this surgery does not affect health, can be completed in fifteen minutes, and is very safe), or purchase the most suitable and effective cervical caps with external spermicidal creams (spermicide drugs) for their lovers, and teach their lovers how to use them. Now, many men are unwilling to bear the major political task of birth control, but instead push the responsibility onto women. This serious mistake must be corrected as soon as possible.

From a practical point of view, condoms are more than ten times cheaper and easier to use than cervical caps, and everyone can use them. Cervical caps are too expensive, more than one yuan each (caused by the China Pharmaceutical Company's profiteering viewpoint), and most people cannot afford them. At the same time, doctors need to assist in selecting and guiding how to use them, which is still difficult to promote to factory, mine, and rural masses. We should learn and adopt effective methods that have been proven in the Soviet Union, New countries, Japan, India, Britain, France, Italy, and other countries, combining them with the situation in various parts of China. There are still many problems with Chinese and Western medicine contraception methods, and we must actively and organizedly conduct research in order to find more effective, simple, and economical methods that are more suitable for the specific situation of the vast working class and peasant masses as soon as possible. As for unscientific or immature contraception methods, such as tadpole or acupuncture methods, they are academic issues that still need to be studied or explored, and should not be exaggerated and promoted in newspapers or mass meetings too early, causing contraception to become pregnancy, making young people lose confidence in contraception methods in the future, and affecting the promotion of birth control work.

Developing and implementing planned birth control is a great measure with enormous economic and political significance that must be taken to build a socialist society in the motherland. Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction is what all Chinese people demand, because it is in line with the highest interests of all Chinese people. Its implementation will guarantee the happy and fulfilling life of all Chinese people in the future. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, all of us medical and health workers are willing to contribute all our strength and resolutely complete this glorious task with action, together with the people of the whole country.

    必须有计划地节制生育
    钟惠澜的发言
    我们非常荣幸的在2月27日亲自听到了毛主席在最高国务会议时的十二条英明指示，条条都给我们莫大的启发和教育。深感到听了主席一夕话，胜读十年书。毛主席讲了四个多小时，谆谆善诱，诲人不倦。他亲自教育我们要把人民内部的是非矛盾问题和敌我之间的性质不同的对抗性矛盾问题区别清楚。他亲自教育了我们工作方法，凡遇着思想问题，要用教育说服方法和与人为善治病救人的态度而不应该用粗暴的行政方法或手段去处理。毛主席也亲自教育了我们两点论的思想方法：凡任何问题都有两面，好中有坏，坏中有好，好可以坏，坏可以好。毛主席亲自教育了我们如何用辩证法看问题。从矛盾性看人，从发展看进步。他教育我们把一切错误作为自我教育过程中的经验教训。我们医学界的高级知识分子，特别是我自己，一般学习政治努力不够，遇着问题时，往往不免表现出纯技术观点，我们经常犯的毛病，都是由于政治水平太低，修养太差，因此，说话时往往没有掌握全面，也没有把时间、地点、对象和条件等重要因素仔细考虑，就很片面的顺口而出。我们，特别是我自己，今后要加紧学习政治，进一步的改造自己，更好的为人民服务，才不辜负毛主席对我们这样无限的深切关怀。
    毛主席关于中国人口应有计划的控制生育的英明指示，感动了全国医药卫生界所有知识分子，这个富有创造性的指示实具有政治经济历史和国际重大意义，我们全体医务工作者同全国人民一道，热烈响应毛主席的号召，积极行动起来，一定要把这个光荣伟大任务作好。
    过去的几年中，我们医学界对于避孕的宣传工作和具体措施重视不够，进度很慢。除了各大医院做了一些很被动的人工流产或结扎输卵管的手术以外，也曾为少数妇女配了子宫颈帽，偶尔也有为男子进行结扎切断输精管的手术，但一般来说节育工作没有积极展开，主要原因是思想问题。也可以说明是学习政治不够的必然现象。
    人口增加太多太快，
    对国家，对个人都不利
    中国人民为什么必须要有计划的节制生育呢？其主要理由是因为由于人口增加太多太快，结果造成国家不能不关心的极其重要的问题：（1）威胁人民的经济文化生活水平的提高受了限制。（2）妨碍了家庭的美满幸福生活。（3）妨害青年人事业的发展。（4）影响青年本身的健康和工作。（5）影响着后代的衣食住教育文化与健康。（6）产生了或加重了失学和失业问题。
    我国一向人口众多，解放以后，随着全国人民的生活水平的普遍提高，很多家庭生产了很多孩子。根据各地很不完全的初步的统计，我们近年来每年的出生率为千分之三十五至千分之五十五（即每千人口共生三十五—五十五婴儿），平均约千分之三十七（等于3.7％）。前两年国务院公布全国人口数字为六亿，现在可能已有六点三亿，假如以此数计算（6.3亿×0.037），今年出生婴儿数字将为二千三百三十一万，（假定每一个婴儿一年的营养费为一百元，则1957年出生婴儿的营养费总数超过二十三亿，约为每年发行建设公债总数的四倍，跟着人口每年累增，此数亦每年累增。）以后每年人口基数愈大，每年的出生婴儿总数亦愈多。正如高利的复利贷款数字的迅速累进一样的惊人。谚云一代两个十代千个，是有根据的（2、4、8、16、32、64、128、256、512、1，024）。
    假如今年婴儿死亡率为千分之三十，则今年将有六十九万六千婴儿死亡（2，321万×0.03＝696，300），除此死亡数字外，每年实际增加婴儿数字将为二千二百六十一万三千，这个数字相当于两个捷克斯洛伐克，三个匈牙利或四个奥地利的人口。如果我们每年要严格负责的来迎接这样越来越多的新生小孩，并且准备给与他们适当的衣食住教育卫生，那么不难想像每年需要准备惊人数字的助产士、保姆、护士、医生、托儿所、幼儿园、小学校、中学校、大学校、宿舍、师资、图书教材、卫生工作需要的各种药品、血清疫苗和医院设备等。这些机构的基础装备和技术与非技术干部训练培养，所需的财力、物力、人力和时间，在短期内实无法完全解决的。有人初步估计我国每年死亡率约为千分之十七，从每年出生率千分之三十七减去死亡率千分之十七，每年人口实际增加率将为千分之二十（即2％），实际上恐不止此数，或谓人口自然增加率约为3％，姑且以每年增加2％计之，以（1＋0.02）n的方程式计算，则人口数字的增加将如表1、第一栏所示：按每年人口增加率为2％—4％（千分之二十—千分之四十）推算未来

    根据李副总理的报告，我国每年能有机会就业的职工只有一百多万，但每年人口增加率为2％—3％，也就是说若对人口生育不加以限制的话，今后每年将出现一千多万无事可做的人。
    有人说我国未开辟的土地面积尚有十多亿亩，只要开荒工作做得好，不一定要控制人口生育数字。这种看法是片面的。开荒是祖国经济建设中的一项极其重要工作，但究竟荒地面积和开荒的速度是有一定限度的。在第一个五年计划只能开荒七千万亩，在第二及第三两个五年计划，开荒的速度，可能快一些，但估计目前我国已耕种面积为十八亿亩左右（以平均每年种一次计算），而每年可能受到灾害的面积为一亿多亩，则每年实际生产面积约为十六亿多亩。即令加上每年新开荒面积的生产，也决不能满意地适应目前人口增加速度所要求的生活资料，因此，对人口生育如不加限制，则人民生活在某些程度上不但不能提高，很可能反而要比现在降低。
    从以上所述，可见不负责的无计划的无限制的家庭盲目生育，将带给国家和全体人民非常严重的负担和压力。现在全世界人口尚不到二十六（？）亿，已有不少
  国家感觉到生活资料供应紧张，因为人的衣食住行、教育、文化、卫生等都依靠地球上的物质来供应。房屋基建及家具所用的木材需要几十年才能长大。有优良的土壤、充分的阳光、理想的水利、丰富的矿源、大量的肥料、杀虫药、充分的时间和社会主义的科学经营管理，人民才有可能得到丰富的文化和生活资料。我们祖国的人民得天独厚、地大物博、人口众多，在一定程度上天时、地利、人和的有利条件都是具备，有四千余年的古老文化和悠久的光辉历史，在英明共产党毛主席领导下，我们亲自参加了祖国的建设事业，亲眼看见了祖国由一个半封建半殖民地的科学经济文化落后的贫困衰弱农业国家，以排山倒海之势，迅雷闪电之速，转变为一个具有伟大力量的、前途无限光彩的、朝气蓬勃的社会主义国家，鼓舞着我们全体中国人民永远在毛主席的胜利旗帜下前进。
    为了建设祖国，为了全体人民的衣、食、住、教育、文化、生活的提高，究竟中国人口数字应控制在什么数字以内为合理呢？每年新生人口最大的限度是多少呢？这些都需要进一步的调查研究才能做最后的答复的。但中国人口目前增加太快太多那是肯定的。
    最近一位民主德国的医学教授告诉我说，东德的人口大约控制在平均每个家庭有二点七的人口，也就是说十对夫妇才生七个小孩，这样每年人口还有一些增加，他们认为满意，因为如果平均每个家庭人口增至三点零时，他们的生活水平将受到很大的不良影响。若平均每家庭人口为二点五，则德国人口不增不减，可维持平衡，这些数字只供参考。至于我们中国的人口，目前来看如能把每年出生的数字控制在千分之十七左右似乎可以了，但必须指出由于党中央关于定期消灭疾病的决定，医药卫生工作的进步和人民生活文化水平的不断提高，疾病越来越少，老年人的寿命也越来越长，中国每年总死亡人数将来可能很快地下降到千分之十七以下，至时中国的出生率必须有相应的更严格的控制，否则我们将仍面临人口增加太多太快的严重问题。
    有人曾做初步的估计，如将我们国家生产供应给五亿人口的生活，那将是丰衣足食了。中国人口既不能减少至五亿，只有控制生育。如果在十五年内我们将人口控制在七亿以内，积极的完成祖国经济建设计划，那么1972年的时候，全国人民是可以得到丰衣足食的美满生活的，关键在于青壮年人民能否全心全意响应贯彻毛主席关于有计划的控制人口生育的英明指示。毫无疑问，在党和毛主席的领导下，中国人民是有决心也有信心能完成毛主席交给我们这样具有头等重大政治意义的光荣任务。我们医务工作者愿在即将成立的中央节育委员会领导下贡献一切力量，投入到这项复杂繁重的伟大工作中去，一直到取得胜利才收兵。
    至于马尔萨斯以战争瘟疫疾病来解决人口过剩问题的学说是错误的、反动的。因为帝国主义殖民主义反动势力一向利用这个反动学说来进行侵略，榨取弱小民族和落后国家，这是我们应该坚决反对的。但根据我很肤浅的认识（如有错误，请批评），马尔萨斯关于人口繁殖（若不加以控制的话）以几何级数的速度增加的观察是正确的。在经济和科学落后的国家，在一定情况下，工业农业生产增加的速度是算术级数的，而不是几何级数的那样快，也似乎不无理由。关于人口和土地问题，中苏两国的实际情况完全不同，中国人口比苏联约多二倍，但中国的土地面积比苏联小一倍多。中国的经济文化科学和工业农业生产方式解放后是有很多进步，但基本上大都还相当落后。苏联革命胜利已四十年，经济科学文化和工业农业生产均已达到世界先进水平，苏联人口不够多，基数小三倍，每年增加率亦小而慢，故采取奖励人口增加政策。中国人口基数很大，目前增加率太快太多，故应该辩证的采取有计划的控制生育政策，以便累积大量的资金，保证社会主义建设的早日胜利完成。
    事实证明生育次数多对于妇女的健康体质和寿命都有一定的不良影响，因为在生育过程中一小部分妊妇难免有难产，意外出血，妊娠中毒，子宫瘤，肾脏炎，心脏衰竭等合并症，同时根据统计，子宫及子宫颈毒瘤大多数产生在生育多的妇女。处女或未生育的女性很少得此病的。
    反对早婚，赞成迟婚
    早婚是有害的，结婚年龄应以二十五—三十岁左右为宜，早婚无论从生理方面，临床方面，事业前途方面或后一代的健康福利方面都是有害的。青年人一般在三十岁以前学识经验、工作能力和经济力量都比较薄弱的，不应过早谈恋爱或结婚，应该集中力量，专心学习，努力工作，埋头苦干，锻炼自己，为终身事业前途打好基础，古人说，“一年之计在于春，一生之计在于青年”，“少壮不努力，老大徒伤悲”。
    婚姻法所定结婚年龄是最低限度并不是鼓励人在这个年龄结婚。刚满十八岁的青年，生殖器官发育虽已开始完成，但身体发育还没有达到成熟的地步。因此早婚对青年人身体和下一代的健康与体质都有不良影响。女子早婚和太早生产的害处很明显。例如根据妇产科临床病历统计，难产发生率最多的是在二十二岁以前，年龄越轻，难产率越高，所以女子结婚年龄应以二十五至三十岁左右为最适宜。男子性欲衰退的年龄较女性者为迟，故男子结婚年龄可比女子大些。有人以为女子在二十五岁骨盆关节就硬化了，这是没有根据的，北京上海等大城市里就有不少女医生和其他妇女在二十八—三十岁以后才结婚的，生第一胎时已经三十岁以外了，但并无困难。我认为从医学观点和青年人本身及下一代的利益出发，应考虑把婚姻法所规定最低结婚年龄修改为女子二十四岁，男子二十八岁（少数民族地区不在此限）。
    由于早婚造成了家庭和青年人的种种困难，很多文化水平低的或意志薄弱的青年人，正在应该集中精力学习文化和业务的时候，就谈恋爱早结婚，不到二十五岁就生了不少孩子，青年父母因缺乏经验，经济条件不够，忽视了孩子们的营养健康和教育，这样对待子女，是残酷的是错误的。这些多子女的青年父母，很多往往甚至失去了社会主义主人翁应有的按劳取酬的自食其力的经济独立的自尊心，专依赖组织，要求多给多子女补助费，家庭困难补助费等，组织虽然很关怀，尽了最大努力给予帮助，然而粥少僧多，不一定能满足所有要求，于是有不少的人埋怨组织照顾不够，闹情绪，工作不积极。这些困难都是因为青年人不够负责，过早结婚所造成的。为了全体人民的利益，我们应该反对早婚，提倡迟婚，打破多子女的封建思想及重男轻女的大男子思想。应重视思想教育和广泛深入的宣传。现在已经有不少节育办法是可以采用的。节育工作应该先由高级首长、知识分子和干部开始实行，但最主要的对象实为厂矿和农村的工农青壮年群众，仅厂矿、农村群众已占全国人口90％以上，所以要达到节制生育的目的，必须进行有系统的有组织的深入广泛的宣传教育工作，打破“不孝有三无后为大”、“有子万事足”、“子孙满堂”、“重男轻女”、一定要生男孩子等封建思想。
    我们应该说明早婚的害处，应该反对早婚赞成迟婚。对于晚结婚的女子，或全心全意为人民事业立志不结婚的男女，不应歧视而应该受到社会群众的十分敬佩。
    把节育工作的严重负担，全部推到妇女身上，是极不公平的
    一直到现在大多数人把具有重大政治经济意义的节育工作严重负担，几乎全部推到妇女身上，这是极不公平的，也是错误的。在性生活方面，多数由于男子的主动和要求，女子多为被动。为了工作，为了节制生育，妇女妊娠后进行人工流产、刮子宫、结扎输卵管等手术的麻烦痛苦和可能有的合并症都推在妇女身上是不公平的。应该事先采取预防为主的政策，男子带上阴茎套或切断输精管（这个手术不影响健康，十五分钟可以完成，很安全），再不然替爱人采购最适宜有效的子宫帽配合外用的避孕药膏（杀精虫药品），使爱人学会使用，现在男子多不愿意负担节制生育的重大政治任务，却把责任推给妇女身上。这个严重错误必须早日纠正。
    从实际出发阴茎套比子宫帽便宜十余倍，方便好使，人人会用，子宫帽太贵，每个一元多（中国医药公司暴利观点所造成），多数人买不起，同时需要医生协助选配并指导如何使用，对厂矿及农村群众尚难推广使用，苏新国家以及日本、印度、英、法、意等国家已经实践证明有效的办法，我们都应该结合中国各地情况，学习采用。对于中西医避孕方法，尚存在不少问题，必须很积极地有组织地进行研究，以期早日找到更适合于广大工农群众具体情况所要求的既有效又简便经济的方法。至于没有科学根据的或不成熟的避孕方法例如蝌蚪或针灸等方法，是属于尚须研究或探讨的学术问题，不应过早在报章或群众大会上夸大宣传，造成避孕变为必孕，使青年人以后对避孕方法无信心，影响节制生育工作的推动。
    展开和贯彻有计划性的节制生育，是祖国建设社会主义社会所必须采取的具有莫大经济政治意义的伟大措施。毛主席这个英明指示是全体中国人民所要求的，因为它是符合于全体中国人民的最高利益的。它的贯彻对于全中国人民将来的美满幸福生活，将起保证作用。在英明共产党毛主席领导下，我们全体医药卫生工作者愿与全国人民一道，贡献一切力量，坚决地以行动来完成这个光荣任务。
