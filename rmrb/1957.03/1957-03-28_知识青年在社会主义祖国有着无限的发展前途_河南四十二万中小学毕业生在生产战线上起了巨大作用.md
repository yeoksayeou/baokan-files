　　Educated Youth Have Unlimited Prospects for Development in the Socialist Motherland
　　420,000 Primary and Secondary School Graduates in Henan Play a Significant Role on the Production Front

　　(Our Newspaper News) Since 1954, according to incomplete statistics, more than 420,000 junior middle school and higher primary school graduates in Henan Province have participated in industrial and agricultural production and various national construction undertakings. They have applied their cultural and scientific knowledge to production and have played a significant role on the industrial and agricultural production fronts.

　　In industry, whether in machinery, textiles, coal, electricity, transportation, railways, chemicals, geology, or postal and telecommunications departments, many junior middle school and higher primary school graduates have actively studied technology with their minds open. They have achieved remarkable results in improving product quality, saving raw materials, and fulfilling and overfulfilling state plans. In 1955, the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory transferred a large number of junior middle and higher primary school graduate technical workers to the 402 Factory, Luoyang Tractor Factory, Bearing Factory, and Wuhu Shipyard. Zhou Guansheng, a fourth-grade technician and junior middle school graduate from this factory, made more than 24,000 textile machine parts from waste materials in 1955 alone, and the quality was completely up to standard. Last year, he was selected as a second-class model worker in Zhengzhou.

　　Many junior middle school and higher primary school graduates on the agricultural production front have achieved excellent results in applying scientific knowledge, promoting advanced experience, and adopting various measures to increase production, improve yields per unit area, and develop sideline production. Li Youxuan, a junior middle school graduate and pig-raising expert at Yucheng County Farm, used Pavlov's conditioned reflex principle to make pigs accustomed to whistle-blowing for feeding and resting, which saved a lot of feeding time. He gradually increased the number of pigs he raised from 20 to 115. Combining the knowledge he learned at school, Li Youxuan studied the feeding methods of sows, increasing the number of piglets born at one time from six or seven to eighteen. Bao Zhengyi, a primary school graduate from Yuanyang County, promoted advanced experience in production, and the cotton he grew achieved a high yield record of 481 jin of seed cotton per mu, earning the praise of the masses.

　　Many middle and primary school graduates directly participate in field labor, and some have served as presidents, accountants, production team leaders, technical directors, statistical keepers, work recorders, and librarians of agricultural production cooperatives. Many of them have been rated as outstanding members and labor models for their active work. More than 100 junior middle school and higher primary school graduates attended the recent Fourth Henan Provincial Agricultural, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Labor Model Conference. Among them, 52 were elected as provincial labor models.

　　After many junior middle school and higher primary school graduates participated in agricultural production, they actively spread their cultural knowledge to the masses and contributed their efforts to the cultural liberation of the broad masses of farmers. Yi Junzhi, a folk school teacher in Yizhai Township, Mi County, is a sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl. Since graduating from primary school in 1954 and becoming a folk school teacher, she has overcome many difficulties and inspired the students' learning enthusiasm, increasing the number of students enrolled from thirteen or fourteen to sixty-one, completing the task of eliminating illiteracy assigned to her by the Party ahead of schedule, and winning the love of the masses. She was named a model teacher in the entire special zone.

　　The vast majority of middle and primary school graduates can learn humbly, work hard, and make rapid progress in ordinary labor positions. For example, Lou Suying, a higher primary school graduate, only entered the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory last year, and now she can independently operate a machine tool and complete her plan on time. She is one of many excellent students. There are eight or nine junior middle school and higher primary school graduates in the weaving workshop of Zhengzhou State-owned Cotton Factory No. 1. In ordinary labor such as oiling, wiping cars, sweeping the floor, and arranging shuttles, they not only work actively but also come up with ways to improve work efficiency and save raw materials for the country.

　　Many junior middle school and higher primary school graduates who participate in agricultural production can also humbly learn from experienced farmers and the masses. Zhang Yaorong, a twenty-four-year-old educated youth, is already the president of the Anlewowo Agricultural Production Cooperative on the outskirts of Luoyang City, which has more than 1,300 households. In order to run the cooperative well, he went to the China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm in Shanxi Province to learn experience in running the cooperative. He also went to other villages to ask experienced gardeners to teach vegetable planting techniques and listened humbly to the opinions of the members, enabling the entire cooperative to achieve a bumper harvest.

　　知识青年在社会主义祖国有着无限的发展前途
　　河南四十二万中小学毕业生在生产战线上起了巨大作用
    本报讯　从1954年以来，据不完全统计，河南省已有四十二万多名初中和高小毕业生参加了工农业生产和国家各项建设事业。他们把自己的文化科学知识运用到生产中去，在工、农业生产战线上已发挥了巨大作用。
    在工业方面，无论是机械、纺织、煤、电、交通运输、铁路、化学、地质、邮电等各个生产部门，许多初中和高小毕业生开动脑筋积极钻研技术，在提高产品质量、节约原材料、完成和超额完成国家计划方面，获得了显著成绩。郑州纺织机械厂在1955年就向四○二厂、洛阳拖拉机制造厂、轴承厂、芜湖造船厂输送了一大批初中、高小毕业生技术工人。这个工厂的四级技工初中毕业生周贯生仅1955年一年就利用废料做出二万四千多件纺织机件，质量完全合乎标准。去年，他被选为郑州市二等模范。
    农业生产战线上的许多初中和高小毕业生，在运用科学知识、推广先进经验以及采取各项增产措施，提高单位面积产量，发展副业生产等方面，获得了优良成绩。虞城县农场养猪能手初中毕业生李友轩根据巴甫洛夫条件反射原理，使猪习惯了吹哨吃食、休息，这样就节省了大量的喂养时间。他由一个人养二十条猪逐渐增加到养一百一十五条。李友轩结合在学校所学的知识，研究了母猪的饲养方法，使原来一次生六、七个小猪的母猪，增加到一次生十八个。原阳县小学毕业生包正义，在生产中推行了先进经验，自己种的棉花获得亩产籽棉四百八十一斤高额丰收纪录，博得群众的好评。
    许多中、小学毕业生直接参加田间劳动，有些人担任了农业生产合作社的社长、会计、生产队长、技术主任、统计保管员、记工员、图书管理员等职务，其中有不少人因为工作积极，已被评为优秀社员、劳动模范。出席最近召开的河南省第四届农、林、水劳动模范大会的劳动模范中，有一百多名初中、高小毕业生。其中有五十二名当选为省的劳动模范。
    许多初中、高小毕业学生参加农业生产后，把自己的文化知识积极的传播给广大群众，为广大农民群众的文化翻身贡献出自己的力量。密县奕寨乡民校教师奕俊智，是个十六、七岁的女孩子，自1954年小学毕业担任民校教师以来，克服了重重困难，鼓舞了学员们的学习情绪，使入学人数由十三、四人增加到六十一人，提前完成了党所交给她的扫盲任务，受到群众的爱戴，被评为全专区的模范教师。
    绝大部分中、小学毕业生在平凡的劳动岗位上能虚心学习，任劳任怨，进步很快。如高小毕业生娄素影去年才进郑州纺织机械厂，现在就可以单独看一部机床，并能按时完成计划，是许多优秀学员中的一个。郑州国棉一厂织布车间有八、九个初中和高小毕业生。他们在加油、擦车、扫地、摆梭等平凡的劳动中，不但积极工作，还能想窍门提高工作效率，为国家节约原料。
    参加农业生产的初中、高小毕业生，有很多人也能虚心地向老农学习，向广大群众学习。二十四岁的知识青年张耀荣，他已是一千三百多户的洛阳市郊安乐窝农业生产社的社长了。为了把社办好，他曾到山西省中苏友好集体农庄学习办社经验，他还到外村请老圃教种菜技术，虚心听取社员们的意见，使全社获得大丰收。
