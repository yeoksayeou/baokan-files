    Dispel Concerns, Dare to Debate, Speak Without Reservation, Say All You Know
    Lu Kanru Speaks: Hopes that the academic community and democratic parties can implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and "Long-term coexistence, mutual supervision" in this spirit.
    During the sessions of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), we attended the Supreme State Council meeting and listened to the twelve directives of our beloved leader Chairman Mao, which gave us tremendous encouragement and education. Among these twelve points, one is about "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and "Long-term coexistence, mutual supervision." As a higher education worker and a member of a democratic party, I would like to share my personal, superficial understanding of this point.
    Shortly after the second session of the CPPCC last year, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward these two extremely wise policies. For intellectuals like us who are a bit older, these sixteen characters have an extremely profound ideological liberation effect, dispelling many of our unnecessary concerns and increasing our confidence and courage in our work.
    It should be admitted that in the seven or eight years since liberation, thanks to the correct implementation of the Party's policy of "unity-criticism-unity," the ideological understanding of intellectuals across the country has made considerable progress. Precisely because of this, when the Hungarian incident occurred last year, the ideological situation of intellectuals in various countries was a bit turbulent, but in our country, it was only like "a ripple on a pool of spring water," as Chairman Mao said, and did not reach the point of "waves surging to the sky." However, we must not be complacent because of this. In literary and art circles, scientific circles, and democratic parties, it is absolutely necessary to continue to strengthen propaganda and education and implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and "Long-term coexistence, mutual supervision."
    Because we have not studied Marxism-Leninism deeply and thoroughly enough, we often cannot freely debate academic issues, being "fearful and hesitant," and full of concerns. If we see an academic paper in the People's Daily or a literary criticism article in the Literary Gazette, we immediately mistakenly believe that this is the conclusion of the Party Central Committee, and even if we have different opinions, we dare not speak out. If the author of this article is a leading figure in the academic community or a responsible comrade in a certain government department, we are even more trembling, copying and repeating it, without daring to make any changes. In fact, this is entirely our own "drawing a circle on the ground as a prison." The Party Central Committee certainly does not intend to draw conclusions on all academic issues on our behalf, and the authors of these articles do not consider themselves to be "golden rules" that cannot be discussed. The result of "drawing a circle on the ground as a prison" only hinders the prosperity of academia.
    This is why the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" has won the enthusiastic support of intellectuals across the country. Although some friends in fraternal countries do not quite agree, and although a small number of comrades in the country express doubts, I dare say that the vast majority of the academic community sincerely welcomes it, because this policy greatly encourages our enthusiasm and creativity, and liberates us from numerous constraints and concerns. Now the problem is not that this policy is being implemented excessively, but that propaganda and implementation are far from enough. We ask the editors of the People's Daily and other newspapers and magazines to take the lead in this regard, first dispelling your own concerns, and then eliminating readers' misunderstandings. In an atmosphere of promoting free debate and encouraging criticism and self-criticism, we can push forward the work of literary and art circles and scientific circles.
    If intellectuals have many concerns about academic issues, then they have more and greater concerns about party relations. With very few exceptions, the vast majority of intellectuals recognize that the socialist road is the truly happy road, and recognize that only the Communist Party can lead us to a truly happy state; therefore, they support the leadership of the Communist Party from the bottom of their hearts. At the same time, many people who have studied political theory also understand that the Communist Party is not only not afraid of criticism, but also welcomes it. However, even though the theory is the theory, the fact is still the fact. It is still not a common occurrence for party members and members of democratic parties to be able to offer opinions to each other without any concerns. This undoubtedly harms the cause of socialist construction.
    The proposal of the policy of "Long-term coexistence, mutual supervision" gives us no less encouragement than "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." Recently, the Party has also put forward the slogan of "political freedom, organizational independence," and Party committees at all levels have also taken the initiative to extend their hands to the democratic parties. To be honest, in such a benevolent and righteous situation, we really feel both grateful and ashamed. Grateful for the Party's emphasis on and trust in us, and ashamed that we have done too little and have truly failed to live up to the Party's emphasis on and trust in us. The reason why we have done too little is not only because we lack the ability, but also because we do not pay enough attention to party work. The reason why we do not pay enough attention is partly because we do not clearly understand the great significance of this work, and partly because we inevitably still have some concerns in our minds. Some concerns come from the side effects of the anti-rebellion movement. Unclear understanding and unresolved concerns ultimately stem from our lack of study.
    Summarizing what has been said above, I put forward three hopes:
    First, I hope that comrades in the academic community will break through concerns, dare to debate, and create an atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism to promote academic work.
    Second, I hope that members of democratic parties can establish a sense of ownership, offer more constructive and rationalization proposals, and truly become a powerful assistant to the Party. At the same time, they must also honestly accept the leadership of the Party and gradually improve themselves.
    Third, I hope that all parties will cooperate to continue to strengthen the propaganda of the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and "Long-term coexistence, mutual supervision," so that these two great and correct policies can be further implemented.

    解除顾虑  勇于辩论  知无不言  言无不尽
    陆侃如发言：希望学术界和民主党派能够本着这种精神贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”“长期共存，互相监督”的方针
    在这次政治协商会议开会期间，我们列席了最高国务会议，听取了我们敬爱的领袖毛主席的十二项的指示，给了我们莫大的鼓舞和教育。在这十二项中，有一项是关于“百花齐放，百家争鸣”和“长期共存，互相监督”的。作为一个高等教育工作者和民主党派的成员，我愿意就这一项谈谈我个人的粗浅的体会。
    在去年政协举行第二次会议之后不久，党中央和毛主席就提出了这两个极其英明的方针。对于像我们这样年纪比较大一点的知识分子来说，这十六个字具有极其深刻的思想解放的作用，解除我们许多不必要的顾虑，提高我们在工作中的信心与勇气。
    应该承认，在解放后的七、八年中，由于正确地执行了党的“团结——批评——团结”的政策，全国知识分子在思想认识上已有不少的进步。正因为这样，所以去年匈牙利事件发生以后，各国知识分子的思想情况都有点动荡，而在我国却不过像毛主席所说的“吹皱一池春水”而已，没有到达“波浪兼天涌”的地步。但是我们万不能因此而自满。在文艺界、科学界里，在民主党派里，继续加强宣传教育和贯彻执行“百花齐放，百家争鸣”和“长期共存，互相监督”的方针，是完全必要的。
    由于我们对于马克思列宁主义学习得不深不透，所以在学术问题上常常不能自由争论，“畏首畏尾”，顾虑重重。假使在人民日报上看到一篇学术性的论文，或是在文艺报上看到一篇文学批评的文章，马上就误认为这就是党中央的结论，即使自己有不同的意见也不敢说出来。假使这文章的作者是学术界的领导人物，或是政府某一部门的负责同志，那更是战战兢兢，照抄照搬，不敢稍有改动。其实这完全是我们自己“画地为牢”。在党中央固然没有打算替一切学术问题代做结论，而这些文章的作者也没有自认为“金科玉律”，不许讨论。“画地为牢”的结果，徒然妨碍了学术的繁荣而已。
    这就是为什么“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针获得全国知识分子热烈拥护的原故。尽管兄弟国家内有些朋友不大赞成，尽管国内也有一小部分同志表示疑虑，但是我敢断言学术界绝大多数是衷心欢迎的，因为这方针大大地鼓励了我们的积极性与创造性，把我们从重重束缚、重重顾虑中解救出来。现在并不是这方针做得过分的问题，而是宣传贯彻得远远不够的问题。我们要求人民日报和其他报刊、杂志的编辑同志们，要在这一点上起带头作用，首先解除你们自己的顾虑，然后才能免除读者的误会。在提倡自由争论，鼓励批评与反批评的空气中，把文艺界、科学界的工作推进一步。
    如果说知识分子在学术问题上有许多顾虑的话，那末，在党派关系上的顾虑就更多、更大了。除了极个别的例外以外，知识分子极大多数都认识到社会主义的道路是真正幸福的道路，都认识到只有共产党才能把我们引进真正幸福的境地去；因此，对于共产党的领导都是从心里拥护的。同时，多少学习过政治理论的人，也都明白共产党不但不怕批评，而且欢迎批评的道理。但是，道理尽管是道理，事实却总还是事实。党员与民主党派成员之间，真正能够毫无顾虑的互相提意见，却还不是一件普遍能做到的事情。这不成问题对于社会主义建设事业是有损害的。
    “长期共存，互相监督”的方针的提出，给予我们的鼓舞不下于“百花齐放，百家争鸣”所给予的。近来，党又提出了 “政治自由，组织独立”的口号，各级党委也主动地向民主党派伸出手来。老实说，在这样仁至义尽的情况下，我们实在感到又感激又惭愧。感激的是党对我们的重视与信任，惭愧的是我们做得太少，实在辜负了党的重视与信任。我们做得太少，固然由于我们能力不够，但更由于我们对党派工作重视不够。我们所以重视不够，一方面因为我们对这工作的重大意义认识不清，一方面也因为我们思想上不免还存在一些顾虑。有些顾虑来自肃反运动的副作用。认识不清，顾虑未消，归根结蒂，还是由于我们学习不够。
    总结以上所谈，我提出三点希望：
    第一，希望学术界同志们打破顾虑，勇于辩论，造成批评与自我批评的风气，来推进学术工作。
    第二，希望民主党派的成员能够确立主人翁的态度，多提建设性的合理化建议，真正成为党的有力的助手。同时也要老老实实地接受党的领导，逐步提高自己。
    第三，希望各方面配合起来，继续加强宣传“百花齐放，百家争鸣”和“长期共存，互相监督”的方针，使这两个伟大的、正确的方针得到进一步的贯彻。
