    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Western European Union meeting held in London on the 26th, after a day of meetings, did not reach any agreement on the plan to reduce British troops stationed in West Germany. A communique issued after the meeting stated that discussions would continue at another meeting.
    The British decision to withdraw 30,000 ground troops from West Germany has sparked opposition from many Western European continental countries. The United States is particularly vehement in its opposition.
    British Foreign Secretary Lloyd said at the meeting that the British government had decided, based on its economic strength, that in order to prevent military spending from naturally increasing, it must drastically cut armed forces, reduce its obligations overseas, and ensure that Britain remains a nuclear power.
    Britain's allies believe that the British plan is a "threat to the alliance," a "serious psychological and political blow" to Europe, "which will give the impression of Western weakness," "which will sacrifice useful bargaining chips in disarmament negotiations," and "which will restore the old danger of German military superiority in Europe."
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: British Prime Minister Macmillan convened a meeting of the Cabinet Defense Committee on the 27th to study the results of the Western European Union meeting.
    On the same day, Defense Minister Sandys was questioned in the House of Commons on the issue of disarmament. Former Labor Defense Minister Shinwell stated that it would be unwise if the government accepted intimidation from other countries whose military expenditure was less than Britain's. Sandys hurriedly replied that he did not believe Britain had been subjected to such intimidation at the Western European Union meeting.
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Supreme Allied Commander Europe Lauris Norstad reiterated his opposition to the British reduction of its troops stationed in West Germany at a press conference on the 27th. He said he was concerned about any reduction in the Atlantic Treaty troops stationed in West Germany.

    英国裁减驻西德部队问题
    西欧联盟会议争吵一场未获协议
    英国防大臣在下院说英国未受恫吓
    据新华社讯  26日在伦敦举行的西欧联盟会议经过一天会议后，并未就裁减英国驻西德部队的计划达成任何协议。会议发表的公报说，讨论将在另一次会议上继续进行。
    英国要从西德撤出地面部队三万人的决定，引起许多西欧大陆国家的反对。美国反对得特别激烈。
    英国外交大臣劳埃德在会上说，英国政府根据它的经济力量已经决定：要使军费不再自然而然增加，就必须大规模削减武装部队；缩小在海外所承担的义务，使英国继续成为拥有核子威力的国家。
    英国的盟国认为英国的计划是对“联盟的一种威胁”；对欧洲是一种“严重的心理上和政治上的打击”，“这将使人产生西方软弱的印象”，“这将在裁军谈判中牺牲有用的讨价还价的手段”，“这将恢复往日那种德国在欧洲拥有军事优势的危险”。
    据新华社讯  英国首相麦克米伦27日召开内阁国防委员会会议，研究西欧联盟会议的结果。
    同一天，国防大臣桑迪斯在下院在裁军问题上受到质询。前工党国防大臣辛威尔表示，如果政府接受了军费负担比英国少的其他国家的恫吓，那是不明智的。桑迪斯连忙回答说，他不认为英国在西欧联盟会议上受到这种恫吓。
    据新华社讯  欧洲盟军最高统帅劳里斯·诺斯塔德27日在记者招待会上再次表示反对英国裁减它驻西德的部队。他说，他对驻西德的大西洋公约军队的任何裁减，都感到忧虑。
