Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Two pieces of inscriptions personally written by Wu Cheng'en, the author of "Journey to the West," were discovered in Zhicheng, Changxing County, Zhejiang Province. One of the inscriptions is titled with the three characters "Meng Ding Tang" (Dream Cauldron Hall), but the writing on the inscription is already blurred. The other inscription is the "Sacred Well Inscription and Preface," and the inscription is still clearly visible, but the stone tablet is broken into three pieces. If pieced together, the full text can still be copied.

According to research: These two inscriptions were written by Wu Cheng'en on October 10, 1567 (the first year of the Ming Dynasty's Longqing reign) when he served as the Assistant Magistrate of Changxing County. The author of the inscriptions was Gui Youguang, the then Magistrate of Changxing.

    新华社讯　“西游记”作者吴承恩亲笔写的两块碑文，在浙江省长兴县雉城发现。其中一块碑上题着“梦鼎堂”三字，碑文的字迹已模糊不清；另一块碑是“圣井铭并叙”，碑文还清晰可见，但石碑已断为三块，如果拼起来还可以拓下全文。
    据考证：这两块碑文，是吴承恩在1567年（明朝隆庆元年）10月10日任长兴县丞时写的，碑文的作者是当时的长兴知县归有光。
