Comrade Mao Zedong's speech at the enlarged meeting of the Supreme State Conference profoundly analyzed the two types of contradictions currently existing in our country and taught us how to distinguish and handle these two types of contradictions. Premier Zhou Enlai’s report on his visit to eleven countries vividly illustrated the profound changes and developments in the international situation over the past year, pointing out the great victories achieved by socialist countries in uniting against imperialist subversion and wars of aggression; the common aspirations of nationalist countries in opposing colonialism, safeguarding national independence, and defending world peace; and emphasized: "The U.S. government's policy of constantly creating tense situations to carry out expansion and aggression is not only resolutely opposed by all peace-loving countries and people but also inevitably exacerbates the contradictions among imperialist countries." The past year was the most intense and acute year of class struggle between revolution and counter-revolution on a global scale, and also a year in which our country achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution. If we appreciate these two reports from the realities of international and domestic political life, we will have a deeper understanding. I suggest organizing a thorough study of these two reports nationwide.

Everywhere is a thriving scene

In the year since the Second Plenary Session of the CPPCC, I have participated in inspection work twice. From mid-May to early July last year, I and other members and representatives inspected the work in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. From late November last year to early January this year, I and seventeen other members and representatives inspected the work in Guangdong Province. Both inspections focused on higher education and scientific research. We inspected three higher education institutions and a preparatory institution for a scientific branch in Gansu Province; five higher education institutions in Shaanxi Province; and six higher education institutions, sixteen middle schools, and nine primary schools in Guangdong Province. In Gansu, we also traveled far to inspect the Yumen Oilfield, and we also saw a copper mine and the Liujiaxia Reservoir project in a certain area. In Shaanxi, we visited the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an and saw the Dongfanghong Agricultural Production Cooperative. In Guangdong, we inspected Zhanjiang Port and Hainan Island. Within a year, I went from the northwest of the motherland to Hainan Island, and everywhere I saw an unprecedented upsurge in building socialism and a thriving and vibrant atmosphere. Workers and peasants are working hard on various production fronts, joyfully laboring to build the motherland and create their own happy lives. Intellectuals and scientific and technical workers are enthusiastically responding to the Party and government's call to advance towards science, and a new atmosphere of academic research has emerged. All this has made me deeply appreciate the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and I am deeply convinced that our great motherland will surely be built into a prosperous, strong, and happy socialist industrialized country in a not too long time! During the inspection, we saw the tremendous achievements made in various fields, and we also saw some new problems arising in the process of progress and development, or some difficulties and shortcomings existing in the work. We promptly reported these issues to the relevant parties on the spot and submitted reports to the Standing Committees of the NPC and CPPCC. Before the opening of this meeting, I had already received ten replies from relevant departments forwarded by the Standing Committee regarding the suggestions in our inspection report for the first half of the year. All issues that could be resolved have been or are being addressed by various parties, and those that cannot be resolved have also been explained. I express my satisfaction with this conscientious and responsible attitude, which also shows that our inspection system is a good system.

Last fall, during the inspection in Guangdong, we paid more attention to the education work of primary, middle, and high schools, and we have already submitted a report and expressed our views and opinions in the symposium. We also put forward ten concrete suggestions in the report. We believe that the relevant parties will seriously treat these opinions and suggestions and take all possible measures.

"Pearl of the South China Sea" will be more brilliant

Now, please allow me to talk about my impressions of the inspection of Hainan Island. Hainan Island is known as the "Pearl of the South China Sea." Its total area is 50,330,000 mu, with 6,000,000 mu of cultivated land, 6,450,000 mu of forests, about 20,000,000 mu of wasteland, about 5,830,000 mu of barren mountains, and about 12,000,000 mu of other land. The current population of Hainan Island is more than 2,600,000, including more than 2,280,000 Han people, more than 350,000 Li people, more than 16,000 Miao people, and more than 1,700 Hui people. Hainan Island is in the tropics, with an average temperature of 22° to 28° Celsius, with July being the hottest month, averaging 32° to 34° Celsius. The annual rainfall is about 1,500 to 2,000 millimeters, mostly concentrated in July, August, and September. The coastline of Hainan Island is about 1,470 kilometers, and the width is about 145 kilometers. The main mountain range is Wuzhi Mountain, with a height of 1,879 meters above sea level. There are more than 370 rivers of various sizes, with a hydropower potential of more than 700,000 kilowatts, the largest river being the Nandu River. Hainan Island has more than 60 harbors of various sizes, among which Yulin, Haikou, Qinglan, and Baimajing are the most famous. Aquatic products and salt production are very rich. Yinggehai is building a modern salt field. Yulin Port is the best military port in southern China and is the gateway to defend the motherland. Twenty-nine types of minerals have been discovered on the island, totaling 564 locations.

We can know from these simple statistics that Hainan Island is truly a good place with "spring all year round and treasures everywhere." In the past, under the long-term oppression of reactionary rule, the people's lives were extremely difficult. After the destruction of the war and the plunder of the Japanese invaders, it was even more dilapidated and impoverished. Since the Great Revolution, the Chinese Communist Party has led the people of all ethnic groups in Hainan in a long-term revolutionary struggle, which has persisted until the nationwide liberation. The "undefeated red flag" is the most glorious symbol of the people of Hainan! Because the Party has a high prestige among the people, the restoration and construction of Hainan Island after liberation has been successful. In particular, significant achievements have been made in transportation, water conservancy, and agricultural production construction. The work of the Nada Rubber Plantation and the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm has progressed. The Haiyu Middle Line Highway (Haikou to Yulin Port), which runs through Hainan Island, is of a very high standard. Water conservancy construction has made plans for the three major rivers, planning to build a total of nineteen reservoirs with a power generation capacity of about 270,000 kilowatts. The first phase plans to build ten reservoirs with a power generation capacity of more than 140,000 kilowatts. If this plan is completed, it will greatly promote the construction of agriculture and industry in Hainan Island.

However, the construction of Hainan Island is multifaceted, and it needs to be combined with the industrialization process of our country to formulate a long-term vision plan, taking into account the overall situation and making appropriate arrangements to avoid detours, give full play to the superior natural conditions of Hainan Island, develop its treasures, and contribute to the construction of Hainan and the motherland.

Although this was a short-term sightseeing trip for me, and I did not see everything comprehensively, I would like to put forward three very immature suggestions for consideration by the relevant parties:

First, in order to have a more comprehensive consideration of the construction of Hainan, it is necessary to further understand the situation. It is recommended that the relevant departments of the central government organize a resource survey team, including experts and engineers from various fields, to conduct a more detailed survey of Hainan, basically clarifying the resource situation of Hainan Island within one or two years, in order to prepare conditions for the development of Hainan.

Second, since Hainan Island is a tropical region, its natural conditions provide many conveniences for industrial and agricultural production and construction, but also bring many new problems that need to be systematically investigated and studied in order to be properly solved. It is hoped that the Chinese Academy of Sciences or the South China Branch of the Academy of Sciences will consider establishing a scientific research institute on Hainan Island, focusing on the scientific investigation and research on the protection of tropical crops, diseases and medicine in tropical regions, natural disasters, and other aspects.

Third, considering the specific situation of the country's financial, human, and material resources, in order to enable the construction of Hainan Island to be coordinated with the industrialization process of our country and the future vision needs, it is recommended that a relatively long-term vision plan for the construction of Hainan be formulated on the basis of clarifying resources, gradually creating conditions, and striving to achieve this plan.

Our great motherland is a large country with a population of more than 600 million located on the Pacific Ocean. Taiwan Island and Hainan Island are the two pearls of our motherland. More than 60 years ago, the Japanese invaders occupied our Taiwan. After 50 years of operation, they finally returned Taiwan to our country after the failure of the war of aggression. Taiwan is able to support 10 million people today. Although it is currently armed and occupied by U.S. imperialism, we believe that under the call of "patriotism as one family," the possibility of peaceful liberation of Taiwan is growing. Taiwan will eventually return to the embrace of the motherland. The total area of Hainan Island is only 3% smaller than Taiwan, and its arable area is far greater than Taiwan, and its climate and resource conditions are far superior to Taiwan. The people of all ethnic groups in Hainan have a long-term tradition of revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party. With the support and encouragement of the ever-growing socialist construction forces in our country, the people of Hainan will surely be able to build a bright and splendid new society through long-term efforts. I would like to express my respect to the compatriots in Hainan and the comrades who are working hard on Hainan Island!

May old friends in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao break through the barriers and head towards the light

Finally, please allow me to say a few words through this solemn platform to old friends in the press and cultural circles who remain in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, and overseas. Recalling the arduous years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, we all used our lives to protect the printing press and wrote words with blood and tears under extremely difficult material conditions and the threat of enemy planes bombing day and night, demanding that the soldiers and civilians of the whole country unite and drive away the Japanese invaders and fight to victory. In August 1945, the Japanese government unconditionally surrendered to the Allied countries, and the Chinese nation, which insisted on resisting the war, finally won victory. Didn't this require the efforts of our friends in the press and cultural circles? Yes, the Chinese people will not forget it! In the early days of the War of Liberation, many of our friends in the press and cultural circles appealed to the Kuomintang authorities to stop the civil war, hold peace talks, and resolve national affairs. Wasn't this a patriotic and just act? Yes, the Chinese people will not forget these upright people. However, when the people of the motherland stood up, when people all over the world praised the strength of New China, when tens of thousands of cultural workers and journalists on the mainland were singing, laboring, and creating to their hearts' content for the Mao Zedong era under the encouragement of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," you are lingering overseas, with a bare pen, dim and dull. Moreover, in order to make a living, you have to go against your conscience, say things that you may not believe, and write articles that you may not want to read. Isn't this too cruel for someone engaged in journalism and cultural work? In the past few years, I have learned from the friends who have returned to the mainland from Hong Kong and Macao, and from the newspapers and magazines that you run yourself, that you also have a sad mood of "looking at the wind and thinking about it, how can you not be sad." Then, why don't you muster up the courage to break through the barriers and head towards the light? Old friends, "the general trend of Taiwan's return to the embrace of the motherland is unstoppable, and no force in the world can permanently separate Chinese people from Chinese people." "Patriotism is one family" is a very simple principle, not a strategy. As long as you are patriotic, you are one family. Don't you love your motherland? Don't you want to take the patriotic road and return to the big family of 600 million compatriots? As the old Chinese saying goes, "The heart of right and wrong, everyone has it." Don't let yourselves be blinded any longer, using what you don't believe in, such as "Iron Curtain News," to block your own way back to the motherland! You should open your eyes and see the true face of the motherland that is rapidly developing and changing; open your ears and listen to more fair international public opinion, including the reports of some capitalist countries' news agencies. If you can calm down and think about what forces have enabled the Chinese people to step onto the world stage with a new and amazing posture, becoming a major deciding factor in today's international political life, washing away the humiliation of being enslaved for a hundred years, and carrying forward the 5,000-year glorious tradition of the Chinese nation, I think, you cannot help but have a sense of pride in the "New China" when you think about it in the quiet of the night! After all, we are all Chinese! How can Chinese not love China?

When I looked out over the Pacific Ocean on the defense frontier of Hainan Island, I naturally thought of Taiwan Island, and I also thought of you old friends. Now, the north of the motherland has begun to thaw, and it will soon be spring. I hope that you can respond to the motherland's call for peaceful liberation of Taiwan and fulfill the responsibilities of a journalist and cultural worker, making contributions to the cause of peaceful liberation of Taiwan in all aspects! If you are willing to return to the mainland for sightseeing or to visit relatives and friends, the government can allow it.

    为祖国日益繁荣而自豪
    李俊龙谈视察观感
    毛主席在最高国务会议扩大会议上的讲话，深刻地分析了我国目前的两类矛盾，并教导我们如何区别和处理这两类矛盾。周恩来总理访问十一国的报告，极为生动地说明了一年来国际形势的深刻变化和发展，指出：社会主义国家在团结一致反对帝国主义制造颠复阴谋和侵略战争的反击中所取得的伟大胜利；民族主义国家在反对殖民主义、维护民族独立和保卫世界和平的斗争中的共同愿望；并指出：“美国政府这种不断制造紧张局势以便进行扩张和侵略的政策，不仅受到一切爱好和平的国家和人民的坚决反对，而且也不可避免地使帝国主义国家之间的矛盾更加尖锐化”。去年一年，是在世界范围内革命与反革命的阶级斗争最激烈最尖锐的一年，也是我国社会主义革命取得决定胜利的一年，如果我们从国际政治生活和国内政治生活的现实情况中去体会这两个报告，我们将会有更加深刻的认识和理解，我建议在全国范围内分别组织对这两个报告的深刻学习。
    到处是欣欣向荣的气象
    从政协第二次全体会议以来一年多的时间里，我曾经两次参加视察工作，去年5月中旬至7月初，我和其他委员、代表视察了陕西、甘肃两省的工作。去年11月下旬至今年1月上旬，我和其他十七位委员、代表视察了广东省的工作。两次视察，均着重的看了高等教育和科学研究工作，计在甘肃省看了三个高等院校和一个科学分院筹备机构；在陕西省看了五个高等院校；在广东省看了六个高等院校，十六个中等学校和九个小学。在甘肃又曾远至玉门油矿视察，并看了某地铜矿和刘家峡水库的工程；在陕西曾访问了革命圣地延安，并看了东方红农业生产合作社；在广东曾视察湛江港和海南岛。一年之内，我从祖国的西北到祖国的海南，到处看见一种史无前例的建设社会主义的热潮，到处呈现一种欣欣向荣的蓬勃气象，工人、农民在各个生产战线上紧张地工作，为建设祖国和创造自己幸福的生活而愉快地劳动。知识分子和科学技术工作者热烈响应党和政府向科学进军的号召，出现了一种新的学术研究的风气。这一切，使我深刻体会到社会主义制度的无比优越性，体会到中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导，深信我们伟大的祖国一定能够在不太长的时间内建设成为一个繁荣、富强、幸福的社会主义工业化国家！在视察中我们看到了各方面所取得的巨大成绩，也看到了各方面在进步发展过程中产生的一些新的问题或工作中存在的一些困难和缺点，我们均及时就地向有关方面反映，并向人大和政协常委会提出了报告，到这次会议开幕之前，我已经接到常委会转来有关部门关于处理我们上半年视察报告中建议的答复十件，凡是能够解决的问题各方面均已经或正在采取措施加以解决，不能办的也有所交代，我对这种认真负责的态度表示满意，同时也说明我们的视察制度是一个良好的制度。
    去年下半年在广东的视察，我们比较注意大、中、小学的教育工作，已经提出了报告，并在座谈会中发表了我们的看法和意见，在报告中还提出了十项具体建议，我们相信有关方面一定会认真对待这些意见和建议，采取可能采取的一切措施。
    “南海明珠”将更加灿烂
    现在，请允许我谈谈海南岛视察的观感。海南岛被称为祖国的“南海明珠”，它的总面积共为五千零三十三万亩，已开垦的耕地为六百万亩，林木为六百四十五万亩，荒地约为二千万亩，荒山约五百八十三万亩，其他约为一千二百多万亩。现在海南岛的人口为二百六十多万人，其中汉族为二百二十八万多人，黎族为三十五万多人，苗族为一万六千多人，回族为一千七百多人。海南岛属热带，平均温度为摄氏22°至28°，每年7月最热，平均达到摄氏32°至34°，降雨量每年约一千五百至二千公厘，且多集中在七、八、九三个月。海南岛周围约一千四百七十公里，宽约一百四十五公里。境内山脉主要为五指山，拔海最高达一千八百七十九公尺，境内共有大小河流三百七十多条，水能可发电七十多万瓩，其中最大的河流为南渡江。海南岛的大小港湾共六十多个，其中榆林、海口、清南、白马井最为著名，水产与盐产均极富饶。因果海正在建设一个近代化的盐场。榆林港为我国南方最好的军港，是保卫祖国的门户。全岛已经发现的矿产有二十九种，共五百六十四处。
    我们看了上面这些简单的统计数字，可以知道海南岛真是一个“四时皆春，遍地是宝”的好地方。过去在长期反动统治压榨之下，人民生活极苦，经过战争破坏和日本侵略者的掠夺，更是残破穷困。中国共产党从大革命时期起就领导海南各族人民进行了长期的革命斗争，一直坚持到全国大解放，“不倒的红旗”是海南人民最光荣的标志！因为党在人民群众中有高度的威信，解放后海南岛的恢复和建设是有成绩的，特别在交通、水利和农业生产建设上已经取得了显著的成就，那大橡胶园和兴隆华侨农场的工作是有进步的，纵贯海南岛的海榆中线公路（海口到榆林港）是标准很高的，水利建设已作好三大河流规划，拟共修十九个水库，发电量约二十七万多瓩，第一期拟修十个水库，可发电十四万多瓩，如果这个计划完成，对海南岛的农业和工业生产的建设，将起着极大的推动作用。
    但是，海南岛的建设是多方面的，需要配合我们国家的工业化进程订出一个长期的远景规划，统筹兼顾，适当安排，以避免走弯路，充分发挥海南岛优越的自然条件，开发它的宝藏，为海南人民也为祖国建设贡献巨大的力量。
    我这次虽然是短期的观光，看得很不全面，但也愿意在此提出三项极不成熟的建议，供有关方面考虑：
    第一，为了对海南建设作较全面的考虑，进一步摸清情况是必要的。建议中央有关方面，组织一个资源勘察队，包括各方面的专家和工程技术人员，到海南进行一次较详细的勘察工作，在一、二年内基本上弄清楚海南岛的资源情况，以便为开发海南准备条件。
    第二，由于海南岛是热带，它的自然条件为工、农业生产建设提供许多便利也带来许多新的问题，需要作系统的科学的调查研究，才能很好地加以解决。希望中国科学院或华南科学分院考虑在海南岛设立一个科学研究所，着重对热带作物的培护问题及热带地区疾病、医药、自然灾害……等各方面的问题作有组织有计划的科学性的调查研究。
    第三，考虑到国家的财力、人力和物力的具体情况，为了使海南岛的建设能够配合我们国家的工业化进程和将来的远景需要，建议在查清资源的基础上拟订一个比较长期的海南建设远景规划，逐步创造条件，为实现这个计划而努力。
    我们伟大的祖国是一个位于太平洋上拥有六亿多人口的大国，台湾岛和海南岛是我们祖国的两颗明珠。六十多年前，日本侵略者占去了我们的台湾，经过五十年的经营，终于在侵略战争失败后将台湾归还我国。台湾今天能够养活一千万人口，目前虽为美帝国主义武装侵据，我们相信在“爱国一家”的号召之下，和平解放台湾的可能性正在增长，台湾终究是要回到祖国怀抱的。海南岛的总面积只比台湾小
  3％，而其可耕面积远较台湾为大，气候和资源条件也远较台湾为优越，海南各族人民又有在共产党领导下的长期革命斗争传统，在我国社会主义建设力量日益发展的支援和鼓舞之下，海南人民是一定能够以长期的努力来建设一个光辉灿烂的新社会的，我愿在此向海南同胞和在海南岛辛勤工作的同志们表示敬意！
    愿台湾、港澳旧友冲破藩篱奔向光明
    最后，请允许我通过这个庄严的讲坛向留在台湾、港、澳和海外各地的新闻界、文化界的旧朋友们讲几句话。回忆在抗日战争的艰苦岁月里，我们大家曾经在极端困难的物质条件和敌机日夜轰炸的威胁下，用生命保护印刷机，用血泪写成文字，要求全国军民，团结一致，赶走日本侵略者，战斗到胜利。1945年8月日本政府向盟国无条件投降，坚持抗战的中华民族，终于获得了胜利，这难道没有我们新闻界、文化界朋友的一份力量吗？有的，中国人民是不会忘记的！在解放战争的初期，我们许多新闻界、文化界的朋友向国民党当局呼吁停止内战，举行和平谈判，解决国是，这难道不是一种爱国的正义行动吗？是的，中国人民也不会忘记这些正直的人。可是，当祖国人民站起来了的时候，全世界人民歌颂新中国强大的时候，大陆上成千成万的文化工作者和新闻工作者在“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的鼓舞下为毛泽东时代而尽情歌唱、劳动、创造的时候，你们却栖迟海外，一枝秃笔，黯然无光。而且为了升斗之粟，还要违背良心，说些自己也未必相信的话，写些自己也未必愿看的文章，这对一个从事新闻和文化工作的人来说，难道不是太残酷了吗？这几年，我从港澳回到大陆来的朋友们的口中，也从你们自己所办的报纸刊物中，知道你们也有一种“望风怀想，能不凄然”的悲苦心情，那末，你们为什么不鼓起勇气冲破藩篱奔向光明呢？旧朋友们，“台湾回到祖国怀抱的大势是不可阻挡的，世界上没有任何力量可以把中国人同中国人永远分割开来。”“爱国一家”是一条极简单的道理，决不是什么策略，只要爱国，就是一家，难道你们不爱自己的祖国吗？难道你们不想走爱国的道路回到六亿同胞的大家庭里来吗？中国古话说：“是非之心，人皆有之。”你们不要再迷住自己的眼睛，用自己也不相信的什么“铁幕新闻”一类的东西阻碍你们自己回到祖国的道路吧！应该打开眼睛，看看祖国日在迅速发展变化中的真正面貌；放开耳朵，听听比较公正的国际舆论，包括一部分资本主义国家通讯社的报导在内。你们如果能够冷静下来，想一想是什么力量使中国人民以新的惊人的姿态走上世界舞台，成为今天国际政治生活的重大决定因素，洗去了百年来被人奴役的耻辱，发扬了中华民族五千年的光荣传统，我想，你们清夜自思，也不能不有一种“新中国”的自豪感吧！归根结底，我们都是中国人呵！中国人怎能不爱中国？
    当我在海南岛国防前线了望太平洋的时候，很自然地想到台湾岛，也就连想到你们这些旧朋友。现在，祖国的北方已经开始解冻，不久就要到春暖花开的时候了，我期望着你们能够响应祖国和平解放台湾的号召，尽一个新闻工作者和文化工作者的职责，从各方面对和平解放台湾的事业作出贡献！如果你们愿意回到大陆来观光，或者探亲访友，政府是可以允许的。
