Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 9th: The United Nations General Assembly temporarily adjourned its longest session in history at 8:26 PM local time on the 8th, after discussing the Middle East issue. The General Assembly passed a proposal put forward by seven countries—the United States, Canada, Brazil, Colombia, Iran, Japan, and Norway—with 65 votes to 0 and 6 abstentions (the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries), deciding that the General Assembly would temporarily adjourn. The seven-nation proposal also stipulated that if the President of the General Assembly deems it necessary, he can, after consulting with the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the member states of the General Committee of the General Assembly, reconvene the meeting to discuss the two unfinished issues of the General Assembly, namely the Middle East issue and the so-called "Hungarian issue."

Before passing the adjournment resolution, the Soviet delegation requested that the so-called "Hungarian issue" be removed from the General Assembly agenda. This request was not passed by a vote of 59 to 6. Soviet representative Sobolev said that discussing the Hungarian issue was a crude interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.

Before adjourning, the General Assembly heard a report from Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the Middle East issue and held discussions.

In his report, Hammarskjöld spoke about the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the takeover by the United Nations Emergency Force.

    联合国大会暂时休会
    据新华社9日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会8日当地时间八时二十六分在讨论中东问题后暂时结束了它历史上最长的一届会议。大会以六十五票对零票和六票弃权（苏联和东欧国家），通过了美国、加拿大、巴西、哥伦比亚、伊朗、日本和挪威七国提出的一项提案，决定大会暂时休会。七国提案还规定，如果大会主席认为必要时，可以在同联合国秘书长和大会总务委员会成员国咨商下，重新召开会议讨论大会未了的两个问题，即中东问题和所谓“匈牙利问题”。
    在通过休会决议之前，苏联代表团要求取消大会议程上的所谓“匈牙利问题”，这个要求以五十九票对六票的表决结果没有获得通过。苏联代表索波列夫说，讨论匈牙利问题是对一个主权国家的内政的粗暴干涉。
    大会休会前听取了秘书长哈马舍尔德关于中东问题的报告，并且进行了讨论。
    哈马舍尔德在报告中谈到以色列军队撤退和联合国紧急部队接管的情况。
