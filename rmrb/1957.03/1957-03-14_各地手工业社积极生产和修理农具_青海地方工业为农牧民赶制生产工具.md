Xinhua News Agency, March 12th: Handicraft cooperatives in various places in the iron and wood industries are producing a large number of new farm tools for spring plowing and repairing old farm tools for farmers.

Handicraft workers in Henan Province will supply farmers with more than 20 million farm tools this spring, and a batch has already been produced and supplied to farmers. Each county in the province has established a farm tool repair station, market towns have established farm tool repair points, and mobile repair teams have been organized in remote areas to repair old farm tools for farmers. The small farm tools produced by handicraft cooperatives in Hunan Province under the organization of supply and marketing cooperatives, as well as the existing inventory of supply and marketing cooperatives, if all sold to farmers, would average more than 70 pieces for each agricultural cooperative in the province. Thousands of iron, bamboo, and wood production cooperatives in various towns and cities in the province have also organized farm tool repair stations or repair teams. For example, 50 large and small market towns in Hengyang County have set up farm tool repair organizations, and some cooperative members carry more than 70 iron furnaces to various agricultural cooperatives to repair farm tools. Half of the members of the county's bamboo and wood production cooperatives have also been sent to the countryside to manufacture or repair farm tools in farmers' homes. In Hebei Province, handicraft cooperatives, based on the fact that some areas suffered from floods and farm tools were damaged a lot last year, plan to manufacture more than 17 million small farm tools this year to supply farmers, an increase of about 10% over last year. Since the beginning of spring, the handicraft production cooperatives in this province have transferred more than 30,000 handicraft cooperative members and organized more than 4,000 farm tool repair stations and repair teams to repair farm tools for farmers in the disaster areas. According to incomplete statistics from eight special districts including Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, and Baoding, these repair stations and repair teams have rushed to manufacture and repair more than 2 million farm tools for farmers in January and February.

This year, most of the handicraft cooperative departments in various regions attach great importance to the production and repair of farm tools in order to support agricultural production and achieve bumper harvests. The handicraft leading departments of Gansu, Shandong, Henan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Shanxi, and other provinces have held special meetings to arrange the production and repair of farm tools, requiring all handicraft cooperatives to overcome and prevent the phenomenon of insufficient supply of farm tools and no one to repair them when they are broken, and no parts to be matched when they are missing. Hunan Province also proposed that the iron and wood industries should implement the principle of "farm tools first, furniture second" during the spring plowing season, first ensuring that spring plowing production is not delayed. In order to overcome the phenomenon of blind production and product backlog in some areas last year, many areas have transferred cadres to the countryside to understand the needs of farmers for farm tools, and then organized production.

Xinhua News Agency: Qinghai Province's local industry is actively producing and repairing farm tools needed for spring plowing for farmers, and is also manufacturing some production tools for herdsmen.

According to the characteristics of Qinghai Province's agricultural areas being mostly mountainous, Qinghai Province's local industry has produced a kind of mountain plow for farmers. This mountain plow is both flexible and lightweight, and is very popular among farmers. The workers of the Xining City Machinery Repair Factory, which produces mountain plows, produced more than 4,000 mountain plows in the first two months of this year, supplying the urgent needs of the countryside. Now the workers of this factory are studying the use of high-silicon pig iron to replace flat steel to solve the problem of insufficient materials for the mountain plow plow beam, and strive to overfulfill the March plan.

Iron handicraft production cooperatives and iron factories, in addition to actively using scrap steel to process and manufacture various small farm tools, have also set up farm tool repair stations and repair teams to help farmers repair farm tools. Some handicraft production cooperatives have also organized mobile repair teams, carrying tools to farmers' doorsteps to repair farm tools and change horseshoes, etc. This not only facilitates farmers, allowing farmers to save more time for production, but also can recycle waste materials such as old horseshoes, solving the problem of insufficient raw materials for handicraft production cooperatives.

    各地手工业社积极生产和修理农具
    青海地方工业为农牧民赶制生产工具
    新华社12日讯  各地铁、木等行业的手工业合作社正在大量生产春耕用的新农具和为农民修理旧农具。
    河南省的手工业者在春季将供给农民两千多万件农具，目前已有一批生产出来供应到农民手里。全省每个县城都建立了农具修配站，集镇上建立了农具修配点，偏僻地区还组织了流动修配小组，为农民修理旧农具。湖南省的手工业合作社在供销社组织下生产的小农具以及供销社已有的储存，如果全部卖给农民，平均全省每个农业社可以得到七十多件。省内各城镇还有数以千计的铁、竹、木业生产合作社组织了农具修配站或修配小组。比如衡阳县五十个大、小集镇就都设立了农具修配组织，还有社员携带七十多座铁炉分别到各农业社去修补农具，全县竹木业生产合作社也抽出一半的社员下乡到农民家里去制造或修理农具。河北省各地手工业合作社根据去年部分地区遭受水灾、农具破损较多的情况，计划今年制造一千七百多万件小农具供给农民，比去年增加10％左右。入春以来，这个省的手工业生产合作社抽调了三万多个手工业社员，组织了四千多个农具修配站和修配小组，给灾区农民修配农具。根据邯郸、邢台、石家庄、保定等八个专区不完全统计，这些修配站和修配小组在1、2月间已经为农民赶制和修配好二百多万件农具。
    今年大部分地区的手工业合作部门，为了支援农业生产获得大丰收，对农具生产和修配工作都很重视。甘肃、山东、河南、广西、江西、山西等省的手工业领导部门，专门召开了会议安排农具生产和修配工作，要求各手工业合作社克服和防止农具供应不上和坏了没人修、缺了零件没法配等现象发生。湖南省还提出铁、木等行业在春耕季节应贯彻“先农具后家具”的原则，首先保证不误春耕生产。为了克服去年有些地区的手工业社盲目生产、造成产品积压的现象，许多地区都抽调干部下乡了解农民对农具的需要情况，然后组织生产。
    据新华社讯  青海省地方工业积极为农民生产和修配春耕需要的农具，并且为牧民制造一些生产用具。
    根据青海省农业区多为山地的特点，青海省地方工业为农民们生产了一种山地犁。这种山地犁既灵活、又轻便，很受农民欢迎。生产山地犁的西宁市机械修配厂的职工，在今年的头两个月里，就生产出四千多台山地犁，供应了农村的急需。现在这个厂的职工正在研究用高硅马铁代替扁钢，解决山地犁犁辕材料不足的问题，争取超额完成3月份计划。
    铁业手工业生产合作社和铁工厂，除了积极利用废钢铁加工制成各种小型农具以外，还设立了农具修配站和修配组，帮助农民修理农具。有的手工业生产合作社还组织了流动修配小组，带着工具到农民家门口去修理农具和换马掌等。这样，不仅便利了农民，使农民省出更多的时间来进行生产，同时，还可以将换下来的旧马掌等废料加以回收，解决手工业生产合作社原料不足的问题。（附图片）
