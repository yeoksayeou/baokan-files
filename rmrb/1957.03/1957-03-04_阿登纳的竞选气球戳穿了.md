    Adenauer's Campaign Balloon Punctured

    Recently, Chancellor Adenauer and the West German government have made some noteworthy statements on issues such as disarmament, European security, and German reunification. For example, Adenauer stated at a press conference that nuclear weapons should be banned and proposed the establishment of a "military sparse zone" in Central Europe. The West German government also announced that it would hold talks with the United States, Britain, and France to formulate a "plan for the reunification of Germany and European security" in order to "promote the cause of reunification." It sounds as if the Adenauer government has suddenly become enthusiastic about the issues of European peace and German reunification. However, based on the recent actual actions of the Adenauer government, it is difficult to find any genuine trace of this enthusiasm.

    After some delay, the West German government published Chancellor Adenauer's response on February 28 to the letter from Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin. In his letter to Adenauer some time ago, Bulganin had put forward many beneficial suggestions for improving Soviet-German relations, disarmament, European security, and German reunification, which aroused great reaction within West Germany, with many opinions demanding that the West German government "seriously consider" the letter. However, Adenauer did not adopt a "serious" attitude in his reply. He insisted on not recognizing the existence of the German Democratic Republic and tried his best to defend the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He also repeated some arguments that Western countries had already overused in negotiations, such as holding so-called all-German "free elections" and implementing "supervised" disarmament. These arguments actually make it impossible for the East and West to reach an agreement and begin taking practical steps on issues such as disarmament, European security, and the reunification of Germany.

    Contrary to Adenauer's expressed views on banning nuclear weapons and ensuring European security, the West German government is using the European Atomic Energy Community to manufacture atomic weapons and to equip the West German army with atomic weapons. The West German government has appointed a large number of Hitler's generals as the leaders of the new West German army and used Speidel as the Central European Commander of the North Atlantic aggressor forces, allowing these executioners of the Nazi era to wield their butcher knives once again. At the North Atlantic Treaty Council meeting at the end of last year, West German Foreign Minister Brentano even proposed a plan to launch an attack on the German Democratic Republic. Recently, the West German government has allowed American rocket and missile units to be stationed in West Germany, turning West Germany into a nuclear war base for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. All of these are in sharp contrast to Adenauer's verbal peace rhetoric.

    Regarding the issue of German reunification, the rational solution is only as pointed out in Bulganin's letter: through consultation and negotiation between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. Ignoring the existence of the German Democratic Republic and attempting to annex the German Democratic Republic by force to achieve German unification is absolutely impossible. However, the Adenauer government insists on not recognizing the existence of the German Democratic Republic, insists on not wanting to conduct negotiations between representatives of the two parts of Germany without external interference, and wants to negotiate the issue of German unification with the three Western countries of the United States, Britain, and France, which are directly responsible for the division of Germany. This cannot achieve any other result other than deepening the division of Germany and increasing the danger of East-West conflict. Because, as everyone knows, the policy consistently pursued by the United States, with the support of Britain and France, on the German question is to maintain the division of Germany, revive the militaristic forces of West Germany, and use it to serve the United States' anti-Soviet strategy.

    Therefore, people have reason to believe that some of the noteworthy statements made recently by Adenauer and the West German government are nothing more than election propaganda balloons. Adenauer's delayed response to Bulganin's letter seems to be because he needed to come up with appropriate reasons to reject Bulganin's constructive suggestions while shifting the responsibility to others.

    Now, Adenauer's reply confirms that people's reservations about some of the election gestures made by Adenauer recently are justified. In fact, the path that Adenauer insists on is still an old path that divides Germany and deepens the danger of war in Europe.

### 阿登纳的竞选气球戳穿了

    阿登纳的竞选气球戳穿了
    最近以来，阿登纳总理和西德政府对裁军、欧洲安全和德国统一等问题曾经发表了一些引人注意的谈话，例如阿登纳曾经在记者招待会上表示应当禁止热核子武器，并提出了在欧洲中部建立一个“军事稀疏区”的建议。西德政府也宣布它将和美英法三国会谈，来拟定“重新统一德国和欧洲安全的方案”，以“促进重新统一的事业。”听起来好像阿登纳政府忽然对欧洲和平和德国统一的问题变得热心起来了。但是根据阿登纳政府最近的实际行动，却很难找到这方面热心的真正痕迹。
    在拖延了一段时间之后，西德政府在2月28日发表了阿登纳总理对苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的信的答复。布尔加宁在不久前写给阿登纳的信中，对改善苏德关系、裁军以及欧洲安全和德国统一等问题曾提出了许多有益的建议，并在西德内部引起了很大的反应，不少舆论要求西德政府“认真对待”这封来信。可是阿登纳在他的复信中却并没有采取“认真对待”的态度。他坚持不承认德意志民主共和国的存在，并竭力替侵略性的北大西洋集团辩护。他也重复了西方国家在谈判中所早已用滥了的一些主张，如举行所谓全德“自由选举”和实施“有监督的”裁军等等。这些主张实际上使得东西方不可能就裁军、欧洲安全和重新统一德国等问题达成协议并开始采取实际的步骤。
    和阿登纳所表示的应当禁止热核子武器、要保障欧洲安全等意见相反，西德政府正在通过欧洲原子联营组织来制造原子武器，并要用原子武器来装备西德军队。西德政府把大批希特勒的将军作为西德新军队的首领，并以斯派达尔作为北大西洋侵略军的中欧司令，使这些纳粹时代的刽子手重又抡起屠刀。在去年年底的北大西洋公约理事会上，西德外长勃伦塔诺更提出了一个企图发动进攻民主德国的计划。而最近西德政府又允许美国的火箭和导弹部队进驻西德，使西德沦为北大西洋集团的原子战争基地。凡此种种，都和阿登纳口头上的和平论调适成尖锐的对照。
    就德国重新统一问题来说，合理的解决办法只有像布尔加宁信中所指出的：通过德意志民主共和国同德意志联邦共和国之间的协商和谈判。无视德意志民主共和国的存在，想用武力来并吞德意志民主共和国，这样来达到德国的统一是绝对不可能的。但是阿登纳政府却坚持不承认民主德国的存在，坚持不愿意在东西两部分德国的代表之间进行不受外力干涉的谈判，而要同对分裂德国负直接责任的美英法三个西方国家去谈判德国统一问题，这除了加深德国的分裂，增加东西方冲突的危险以外，不可能得到任何别的结果。因为，谁都知道，在德国问题上，美国在英法支持下一贯推行的政策，就是保持德国的分裂，复活西德的军国主义势力，利用它来为美国的反苏战略服务。
    因此，人们有理由认为阿登纳和西德政府最近所作出的一些引人注目的表示，只不过是一些竞选的宣传气球罢了。阿登纳对布尔加宁的信迟迟不作答复，看来也就是因为需要想出适当的理由来拒绝布尔加宁的建设性建议而又把责任推在别人头上。
    现在阿登纳的复信正好证实了人们对于阿登纳近来所作出的一些竞选姿态所抱的保留是有根据的。实际上阿登纳所坚持的道路，依然是一条分裂德国、加深欧洲战争危险的老路。
