How the Nanyang County Food Company Promoted the Development of Hog Production
　　Ren Rongting, Jiang Fan

In the past two years, the number of pigs raised throughout the country has largely failed to return to the pre-1954 levels. However, the number of pigs raised in Nanyang County, Henan Province, has been steadily increasing. In 1954, the county had 69,946 pigs, 75,964 in 1955, and 100,002 in 1956. The number in 1956 increased by 35% compared to 1955, and 46.6% compared to 1954.

Nanyang County is an ordinary county in China and does not have any special conditions for developing pig farming. The county has a total agricultural population of nearly 800,000, with a cultivated area of 2,520,000 mu. The remarkable achievements in pig farming last year were, of course, due to the county's Party and government leading organs' emphasis on pig farming, correctly implementing the policy of "private raising as the main method, with public assistance," earnestly solving difficulties such as piglets, funds, and feed, and implementing the policy of retaining meat for those who sell pigs, which stimulated the enthusiasm of farmers to raise pigs. However, under the guidance of the Party and government organs, the Nanyang County Food Company corrected the purely task-oriented view of "emphasizing purchasing and neglecting production" and established the business ideology of "taking production as the center and purchasing as the focus." This policy-oriented shift has indeed played an indispensable role in promoting the development of pig farming throughout the county.

In the past, when purchasing live pigs, the Nanyang County Food Company only focused on completing the task and did not pay enough attention to the difficulties and problems of farmers in raising pigs or the number of pigs raised. In the spring of 1956, according to the instructions of the county's Party and government leading organs, the food company reviewed its past pig purchasing work and proposed completing the tasks of purchasing and supplying based on doing a good job in production. It required each purchaser not only to complete the purchasing plan but also to understand the production situation of live pigs, and to regard caring for production and guiding production as an important condition for the labor competition of all company employees, and also listed it as the main content of the company's inspection of quarterly and monthly plan implementation.

To achieve this goal, they implemented some effective methods: First, the county company set up two cadres specifically in charge of live pig production, who regularly went deep into townships and cooperatives to help plan live pig production, understand the problems and difficulties in developing live pig production, promptly reflected them to the Party and government leading organs, and tried to solve them. Last spring, some farmers lacked the money to buy feed or could not buy piglets. The food company issued them advance purchase funds and told them where to buy piglets. Second, they promoted fine breed piglets and boars to agricultural cooperatives. The food company ordered fine breed piglets as soon as they found them and then sold them to agricultural cooperatives in need. Last year, they used this method to coordinate more than 700 fine breed piglets. The county company squeezed out part of its business expenses to raise three excellent Ukrainian boars, which toured around townships and cooperatives to provide free breeding services, which was very popular among the masses, who competed to supply feed for the boars. Third, they introduced advanced pig-raising methods to farmers, especially recommending alternative feed varieties to solve the difficulty of insufficient feed. Fourth, in addition to completing the prescribed quarantine tasks, the food company's veterinarians often went to the countryside to treat the pigs of the masses free of charge and introduced simple and effective methods for preventing and controlling swine fever to the masses. Fifth, they commended or rewarded agricultural cooperatives that had achieved good results in pig raising. The "Taiyangsheng" Second Cooperative in Wangshi Township had 227 pigs in 1955 and developed to 586 pigs in 1956, averaging one pig per household. The Nanyang Special District Food Company prepared to award the cooperative a red flag and a pair of fine breed piglets.

Because the Nanyang County Food Company adopted these proactive measures to care about production, farmers were both willing to raise pigs and willing to sell pigs to the food company. In this way, the company's purchasing and sales business had a more solid foundation and expanded due to the development of production. In 1956, in addition to exceeding the original plan by 5.2% to complete the task of purchasing fat pigs, the county also ensured a better supply of pork to farmers in the county.

　　南阳县食品公司怎样促进了生猪生产的发展
　　任荣廷　江凡
    最近两年，全国各地的养猪数量多未恢复到1954年以前的水平，但是河南省南阳县的养猪数量却一直在上升。1954年全县有猪六万九千九百四十六头，1955年为七万五千九百六十四头，1956年为十万零二千头。1956年比1955年增长35％，比1954年增长46.6％。
    南阳县，在全国来说是一个普通的县份，并没有发展养猪的特殊条件。全县共有农业人口近八十万，耕地面积二百五十二万亩。去年养猪业所以能获得这种显著的成绩，当然是由于这个县党、政领导机关对养猪业的重视，正确地贯彻了“私养为主，私养公助”的方针，认真地解决了仔猪、资金、饲料等困难，执行了购猪留肉的政策，这就激发起了农民养猪的积极性。但是，在党政机关的指导下，南阳县食品公司纠正了“重收购、轻生产”的单纯任务观点，树立了“以生产为中心，以收购为重点”的业务思想，这一带有方针性的转变，对全县养猪业的发展确实起了不能忽视的促进作用。
    南阳县食品公司过去在收购生猪时，只顾完成任务，对于农民养猪的困难和问题，养猪数量的多少等不够关心。1956年春天，食品公司根据县党、政领导机关的指示，检查了过去的购猪工作，提出在搞好生产的基础上完成收购和供应任务。要求每个收购员不仅完成收购计划，而且要了解生猪生产情况，把关心生产和指导生产作为全公司职工劳动竞赛的一个重要条件，也列为全公司检查季度和月计划执行情况的主要内容。
    为了达到这个目标，他们实行了一些有效的办法：一、县公司设有两个专管生猪生产的干部，经常深入乡、社帮助规划生猪生产，了解发展生猪生产中的问题和困难，及时反映给党政领导机关，并努力设法解决。去年春天，有些农民缺少买饲料的钱，或者是买不到仔猪，食品公司就发给他们预购款，告诉他们什么地方可以买到仔猪。二、向农业社推广良种仔猪和种猪。食品公司发现了良种仔猪就订购下来，然后再售给需要的农业社。去年用这种办法共调剂了七百多头良种仔猪。县公司挤出一部业务费，饲养了三头优良的乌克兰种猪，巡回给各乡、社免费配种，群众非常欢迎，争相供给种猪饲料。三、向农民介绍先进的养猪方法，特别是推荐代用饲料品种，解决饲料不足的困难。四、食品公司的兽医除完成规定的检疫任务，并经常下乡免费给群众的猪治病，向群众介绍简易有效的防治猪瘟办法。五、表扬或奖励养猪成绩好的农业社。王石乡“太阳升”二社1955年有猪二百二十七头，1956年发展到五百八十六头，平均每户有一头，南阳专区食品公司准备奖给这个社一面红旗，一对良种仔猪。
    南阳县食品公司由于采取了这些积极关心生产的办法，农民既愿意养猪，也愿意把猪卖给食品公司，这样，公司的购销业务就有较巩固的基础，并且由于生产的发展而扩大了。1956年全县除超过原订计划5.2％完成收购肥猪任务外，还较好地保证了对本县农民的猪肉供应。
