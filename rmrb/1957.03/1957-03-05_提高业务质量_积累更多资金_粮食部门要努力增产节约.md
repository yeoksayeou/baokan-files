Xinhua News Agency, March 4th. Grain Department must strive to increase production and practice economy.

    Vice Minister of Food Gao Jinchun made a speech today at the National Grain Bureau Directors' Meeting convened by the ministry on the issue of carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy in the grain departments. He pointed out that the management work of the grain departments has improved greatly in the past few years, and the situation of losses has been reversed ahead of schedule. In 1957, the vast number of employees in the grain departments should continue to carry forward the hardworking and simple style of "running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily" on this basis. In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, they should further improve the quality of the entire grain business work, so as to accumulate more construction funds for the country.
    Gao Jinchun said that the amount of commodity circulation expenses of grain enterprises this year is required to be reduced by 5% compared with last year. In this way, all circulation links must grasp the key issues to solve. For example, in the procurement and sales links of grain and oil, it is necessary to implement the policy of pricing according to quality. In storage work, it is necessary to continue to vigorously carry out the "four-without" grain and "four-without" oil warehouse campaign to reduce losses and waste and save expenses. The transportation of grain and oil is an important link. It is necessary to vigorously implement the rational transportation system for grain production and sales in different regions and the trial implementation of the rational transportation system for oil, comprehensively promote rational transportation at the grassroots level in rural areas, and actively carry out rational transportation of grain and oil in urban and industrial and mining areas, requiring transportation costs and loading and unloading costs to be reduced by 8% compared with last year.
    In his speech, Gao Jinchun also put forward opinions on strengthening the financial and expense management of grain enterprises, streamlining institutions, and streamlining reports. He said that non-productive expenditures should be greatly reduced this year, and the operating and management expenses of grain purchase and sales enterprises are required to be reduced by 30%-50% compared with last year.
    Gao Jinchun said that completing the task of increasing production and practicing economy in the grain departments in 1957 is arduous, but this task must be completed. The steps should be both active and steady, preventing being overhasty, and correcting the erroneous view of this movement as a "gust of wind." Actively mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, absorb employees to participate in the management of grassroots enterprises, strengthen the masses' supervision of the work of organs and enterprises, deeply carry out the advanced worker movement, and vigorously promote advanced experience, especially the good experiences related to increasing production and practicing economy created during the movement, should be vigorously publicized and promoted. At the same time, in the movement, we must also care about and pay attention to the welfare of employees, so that the masses can better发挥 their enthusiasm and creativity.

    提高业务质量  积累更多资金
    粮食部门要努力增产节约
    新华社4日讯  粮食部副部长高锦纯今天在这个部召开的全国粮食厅、局长会议上，就粮食部门开展增产节约运动的问题作了发言。他指出几年来粮食部门的经营管理工作，已有很大的改善，提前扭转了亏赔局面。1957年粮食部门的广大职工应该在这个基础上，继续发扬“勤俭办企业、勤俭办一切事业”的艰苦朴素的作风，在增产节约运动中，进一步提高整个粮食业务工作的质量，达到为国家积累更多的建设资金的目的。
    高锦纯说，今年粮食企业商品流转费用开支金额要求比去年减少5％。这样，各个流转环节就必须抓住关键性的问题来加以解决。像在粮食和油脂的采购和销售环节上，都必须贯彻执行依质论价政策。在保管工作上，要继续大力开展“四无”粮食和油脂“四无”仓场运动，以减少损失浪费和节约开支。粮食、油脂调运是一个重要环节，要大力贯彻执行粮食分区产销合理运输制度和试行油脂合理运输制度，全面推行农村基层合理运输，积极开展城市和工矿区粮食和油脂的合理运输工作，要求运费和装卸搬运费比去年减少8％。
    高锦纯在发言中对加强粮食企业部门的财务、费用管理和精简机构、精简报表等都提出了意见。他说，今年要大大减少非生产性的开支，粮食购销企业的经营管理费，要求比去年减少30％—50％。
    高锦纯说，完成1957年粮食部门的增产节约任务是艰巨的，但是这个任务必须完成。步骤既要积极，又要稳妥，防止操之过急，纠正对这一运动“一阵风”的错误看法。积极地发动群众，依靠群众，吸收职工参加基层企业的管理，加强群众对机关、企业工作的监督，深入地开展先进工作者运动，大力推广先进经验，尤其对运动进行中创造的有关增产节约的好经验，更应该大力地进行宣传和推广。同时，在运动中还必须关心和注意职工生活福利，从而使群众更好地发挥积极性和创造性。
