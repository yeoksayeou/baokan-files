Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, March 28th: The Prime Minister of the Union of Burma, U Nu, and Deputy Prime Minister Sao Hkun Hkio, accompanied by Vice Premier He Long, Acting Governor of Yunnan Province Liu Minghui, and the ambassadors of both countries, visited Yunnan University and Yunnan Nationalities Institute this morning. Prime Minister U Nu also delivered a speech to more than one thousand faculty and students at Yunnan University.

When the distinguished guests arrived at Yunnan University, students lining the streets showered them with colorful paper flowers. Prime Minister U Nu frequently waved to the students who were shouting welcome slogans. In the lounge, Vice President Li Guangtian briefed the guests on the university's situation. Li Guangtian also expressed his hope to have the opportunity to learn from the University of Rangoon in the Union of Burma, which has a long history.

Subsequently, a welcome meeting was held in the university's auditorium. Li Guangtian delivered a speech at the meeting, expressing his gratitude for the presence of Prime Minister U Nu and the Burmese guests, and extending brotherly greetings to the Burmese "Pauk-Phaw" (relatives).

When the smiling Prime Minister U Nu appeared on the podium, enthusiastic applause lasting more than ten minutes resounded throughout the hall. Prime Minister U Nu delivered a speech of approximately thirty minutes, encouraging students to study hard, become people with full working ability, and hoping that students would become unselfish, loyal, and honest citizens. Every sentence of Prime Minister U Nu's speech was warmly welcomed.

At the end of his speech, Prime Minister U Nu shouted slogans in Chinese: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!" "Long live peace!"

After Prime Minister U Nu's speech, Vice Premier He Long also gave a brief speech. He expressed his gratitude for Prime Minister U Nu's speech to the Chinese students. He said that both Prime Minister U Nu and Premier Zhou Enlai were among the initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Now, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have become the guiding principles for foreign relations of Asian and African countries. Therefore, he hoped that students would carefully discuss Prime Minister U Nu's speech and Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the University of Rangoon together. They should strive to achieve the "three goods" taught by Chairman Mao, and become loyal and honest citizens as Prime Minister U Nu said. He concluded by saying that the people of China and Burma are "Pauk-Phaw," and we are grateful to our "Pauk-Phaw" Prime Minister U Nu for giving us a speech.

Today, the distinguished guests also visited the Yunnan Nationalities Institute, and were warmly welcomed by more than one thousand students from dozens of ethnic groups. Prime Minister U Nu and Deputy Prime Minister Sao Hkun Hkio talked with students in Burmese and Dai in the classrooms, and observed the Buddhist worship and Christian hymn singing within the institute.

    吴努总理在云南大学发表演说
　　勉励学生作一个忠诚老实的公民
    新华社昆明28日电  缅甸联邦吴努总理和藻昆卓副总理，今天上午在贺龙副总理和云南省代省长刘明辉以及两国大使的陪同下访问了云南大学和云南民族学院。吴努总理并在云南大学向一千多名师生发表了演说。
    当贵宾们来到云南大学时，夹道欢迎的学生在贵宾们身上撒满了彩色纸花。吴努总理在人群里频频向喊着欢迎口号的学生们挥手致意。在休息室里，副校长李广田向贵宾们介绍了学校的情况。李广田还表示他希望能够有机会向缅甸联邦有悠久历史的仰光大学学习。
    接着，在学校的大礼堂里举行了欢迎大会。李广田在会上致词，他对吴努总理和缅甸贵宾们的光临表示感谢，并通过贵宾们向缅甸的“胞波”致兄弟的敬意。
    当微笑着的吴努总理出现在讲坛上时，大厅里响起了历时十多分钟的热烈掌声。吴努总理发表了约三十分钟的演说，他勉励学生们要努力学习，成为有充分工作能力的人，并希望学生们作不自私自利、忠诚老实的公民。吴努总理的每一段话都受到热烈的欢迎。
    吴努总理演说结束时，用中国话高呼“毛主席万岁！”“中缅友好万岁！”“和平万岁！”等口号。
    吴努总理发表演说后，贺龙副总理也作了简短的讲话。他对吴努总理对中国学生发表的演说表示感激。他说，吴努总理和周恩来总理都是和平共处五项原则的创议人之一。现在，和平共处五项原则已经成为亚非国家对外关系的指导方针。因此，他希望学生们将吴努总理的演说和周恩来总理在仰光大学的演说一起加以仔细的讨论。要作到毛主席教导的“三好”，要像吴努总理所说的那样，作一个忠诚老实的公民。他最后说，中缅两国人民是“胞波”，我们感激我们的“胞波”吴努总理给我们作了演说。
    今天，贵宾们还访问了云南民族学院，受到了包括几十种民族的一千多名学生的热情欢迎。吴努总理、藻昆卓副总理在教室里和学生们用缅语和傣语进行了交谈，并观看了学院内佛教徒们拜佛、基督徒诵赞美诗的情况。
