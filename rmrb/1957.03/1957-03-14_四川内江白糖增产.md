    Sichuan's Neijiang Special District, which is rich in sugarcane, produced more than 23,000 tons of machine-made white sugar in January and February this year, an increase of about 150% compared to the same period last year. This year, the district will produce 65,000 tons of machine-made white sugar.
    The Neijiang Special District currently has three machine-powered sugar mills with a total daily crushing capacity of 2,400 tons, four sugar refineries, and more than 700 traditional sugar workshops. It is currently a tense period of production, with thousands of tons of sugarcane being transported to these sugar mills and workshops every day.

    四川内江白糖增产
    四川盛产蔗糖的内江专区，今年1、2月份已经生产出二万三千多吨机制白糖，比去年同时期大约增加了一倍半。今年全区将生产机制白糖六万五千多吨。
    内江专区现有三个共日榨二千四百吨的机榨糖厂、四个炼糖厂和七百多家土糖坊。目前正是生产的紧张时期，每天有成千上万吨甘蔗运到这些糖厂和糖坊里来。
