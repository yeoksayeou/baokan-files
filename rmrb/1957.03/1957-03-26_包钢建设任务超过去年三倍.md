    (Our report) Baotou Iron and Steel Company's factory area construction is proceeding intensely with preparatory work. This year, Baogang's construction tasks exceed last year's by three times, with the largest investment in factory area construction. The earthwork for the massive refractory material factory, coking chemical plant, and mechanical repair factory will begin this year. The seven workshops of the repair facility system, including cast iron, cast steel, metal structure, forging, mechanical repair, electrical repair, and wood mold, will also commence construction within the year. Near the factory area, a 300-mu windbreak and sand-fixing nursery project will also be undertaken this year. At the Bayan Obo mine, nine projects will begin construction this year, including the earthwork for the industrial factory site, a chemical laboratory, and a mechanical repair factory. In addition to the twelve cross-year projects from last year, the construction base will also build new projects such as a precision machine tool warehouse, infrastructure equipment warehouse, and electrical equipment warehouse.
