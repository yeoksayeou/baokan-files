　　Building a Reservoir on Dachen Island
　　Dachen Island, two years after liberation, has become a prosperous fishing port this year. In order to solve the difficulties of drinking and using water for fishermen, the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee has allocated funds to build a reservoir, which is expected to be completed in early April. After the completion of this reservoir, fishermen only need to sail their fishing boats to the dock, and they can use water pipes to draw water to the boats, without having to climb mountains and ridges to carry water.

　　大陈岛上兴建蓄水库
    解放两周年的大陈岛，今年已成为一个繁荣的渔港。为了解决渔民吃水用水的困难，浙江省人民委员会拨款兴建一座水库，预计4月初可全部完工。这座水库建成后，渔民们只要把渔船驶到码头，就可以用水管把水引到船上，不必再爬山过岭地挑水、抬水了。
