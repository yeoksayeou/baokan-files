In attending this CPPCC meeting, I listened to Chairman Mao's report on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation on "Several Issues Concerning the Second Five-Year Plan" before the meeting. During the meeting, I also listened to Premier Zhou's "Report on Visits to Eleven Asian and European Countries," Vice Premier Chen's speech, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the CPPCC Standing Committee, and the speeches of other members. I have received profound education and enlightenment, and my ideological understanding has been enhanced. I express my complete agreement and support.

I am a folk professional artist, and what I want to talk about now is also related to some issues in our opera and ballad singing circles. Since the implementation of the reduction and exemption of cultural and entertainment taxes last year, and the Ministry of Culture's issuance of 5 million yuan in relief funds to aid artists, under the Party's call for "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," China's opera and ballad singing circles have shown unprecedented prosperity. This has not only solved the livelihood of opera and ballad singing artists, but also unearthed many good operas, plays and lyrics, which have played a positive role in enriching the people's cultural and entertainment life. This has greatly facilitated the sorting out of opera and ballad singing heritage, and further expanded the scope of our opera and ballad singing artists to exchange experiences and learn from each other. I believe that in the near future, with the help of literary and art workers, the art of opera and ballad singing will have greater development.

From this point of view, the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is correct. It has improved the people's cultural and entertainment level and brought unlimited benefits to opera and ballad singing artists. I don’t need to say more about these situations, everyone can witness them and they are well known; however, I also feel that there are some problems in our ballad singing circles, and I hope that relevant parties will pay attention to them. I will explain them in three points:

First, in order to inherit the traditional artistic heritage of ballad singing, it is necessary to combine it with arrangements and relief to cultivate the next generation, and request the cultural bureaus of various provinces and cities to establish "Quyi Homes" under possible conditions to solve this problem.

In recent years, many literary and art workers across the country have been constantly sorting out the heritage of ballad singing. These things are the lyrics and storytelling that our artists have "orally transmitted and mentally imprinted" in their minds. For example: Chen Shihe's "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," Wang Shaotang's "Water Margin," and Gao Yuanjun, Song Zongke, and others' Shandong Quick Tales, etc. Such recording and sorting out of ballad singing heritage is good; however, this can only turn the things of ballad singing artists into written things, and only inherits a part of the ballad singing heritage, or one-third. Because the ballad singing heritage includes three things:

1. The things that are "orally transmitted and mentally imprinted" and accumulated in the artists, which is what I said above.
2. The performance experience of ballad singing artists.
3. The accompanists of the singing.

Therefore, it is not enough to only sort out and value the first type, because these three together constitute "Quyi." Of course, there are also forms of Quyi like storytelling and comic dialogue that only speak and do not sing. Our ballad singing circles have a loss, that is, before liberation, most of the people who learned this art were actresses, especially in singing, some of whom were good and had high artistic attainments; but some of them had very low artistic cultivation, and some side effects were mixed in, which invisibly weakened the art of ballad singing. Therefore, some actors have found it difficult to improve after liberation. As for the few remaining old artists, those with high artistic cultivation are very limited. If we do not retain the things they have in time, it will be another loss. As far as I know, many of our old ballad singing artists have said that they are willing to pass on what they have to the next generation. No one wants to take what they have to the coffin, and they will take it out without reservation. Since this is the case, I hope that the cultural organs of various provinces and cities will pay attention to this work.

The art of ballad singing is short, concise, popular, diverse in form, and a light and convenient combat weapon. This art is also deeply loved by the broad masses of the people. From the past two or three years, the art of ballad singing has taken root and developed among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, playing a positive role in promoting our economic construction. In the past year or two, radio stations and art troupes in various provinces and cities have also successively established ballad singing troupes and teams, which shows that this art is loved by the people. Due to this development, some problems have arisen that deserve our attention, that is, how to improve the artistic level of amateur actors and the gradual lack of accompanists. Improving the artistic level of amateur actors certainly requires experienced professional actors to guide them, but more importantly, the lack of musical accompaniment. There was already a shortage of musical accompanists, because an old accompanist had to accompany several performers. Because some people have joined organizations, this has made the number of accompanists even smaller, forming a phenomenon of more singers and fewer accompanists, resulting in a "shortage." If this continues, the situation will become more and more serious. Therefore, I hope that while sorting out the traditional heritage of ballad singing, the work of arranging old artists should be combined with the training of the next generation of ballad singing artists, and the next generation should be trained as soon as possible. A singing actor can be trained in a relatively short period of time, but it is more difficult to train a musical accompanist. If we do not pay attention to this aspect of work and only focus on inheriting the "orally transmitted and mentally imprinted" things of the artists, it is not right, and the skills of some good old accompanists will be taken away. These tasks cannot be completed in a day or two, and should be done quickly. Therefore, I suggest that the cultural departments of various provinces and cities can establish "Quyi Homes" under appropriate conditions to undertake this work. This "Quyi Home" can be large or small, one or two rooms for a small one, and three or five rooms for a large one. Now, most schools have a two-part system, and a large number of students have few extracurricular activities and are idle, and their life content is poor. They can be allowed to participate in learning here, and those with development prospects can continue to study in the future. In this way, the old artists can leave behind what they have, and also train the next generation of ballad singing artists. This is an easy task, with little cost and great results. If this matter is not handled in time, the loss will be great.

Second, it is requested that the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Commerce preserve the existing small entertainment venues and appropriately build some small cultural and entertainment venues.

Since the victory of China's socialist economic construction and transformation last year, commercial departments in various places, in order to adjust the commercial network, have concentrated and expanded the stores, and converted some small cultural and entertainment venues, bookstores, and teahouses into stores. This situation has been found in various places. If this continues, the cultural and entertainment of some people will be affected, and some scattered artists will lose their performance venues, and their lives will be affected, forming a semi-unemployment phenomenon. I think that since our government is to help our opera and ballad singing artists, it certainly does not want artists to be unemployed and lose their source of livelihood. This will increase the difficulty of the government's work and cause some people who have a way of life to lose their jobs. In addition, I suggest that the relevant parties build some small cultural venues, preserve the old venues and maintain their original state. From the past few years, many large theaters have been built in various provinces and cities, but too few small cultural venues have been built. This is too uncoordinated. I think that the cultural and entertainment life of people in some remote areas far from the city will be poor. They will inevitably have to come to big cities to play, which not only increases traffic congestion, but also makes the lives of some scattered artists lose their security. Therefore, I suggest that some areas, especially those far from the city or near factories and mines, should build more small cultural and entertainment venues.

Third, it is requested that the cultural organs of various provinces and cities lead the scattered ballad singing artists, strengthen education, help them learn, and improve their ideological level, so as to serve the masses correctly.

Since the cultural bureaus of various provinces and cities have held registration of scattered ballad singing artists, issued performance licenses, and determined their occupations last year, the achievements have been great; however, until now, the cultural bureaus in many places have not done this work, or have delayed it. Some local cultural bureaus do not care about scattered artists, but let the public security departments manage them, which is not good or reasonable. Some scattered artists reflect that people have been liberated and turned over, but we have only turned over half a body, like children without a mother. Therefore, I suggest that the local cultural organs that have not yet handled the registration of scattered artists should handle the registration as soon as possible, organize them, give play to their role, and serve the masses.

Finally, I hope that our ballad singing artists in various places will be self-reliant and strive for regeneration under possible conditions, and also establish a style of hard work and thrift, because our country is in a period of economic construction, and some difficulties still need everyone to work together to overcome. Now, it is also in a period of increasing production and practicing economy. Our current task is to learn from each other, exchange experiences, and strive for the prosperity of new ballad singing, and strive to promote the unity between us and literary and art workers.

### 为繁荣新的曲艺而努力  连阔如的发言

    为繁荣新的曲艺而努力
    连阔如的发言
    我参加这次政协会议，在会前听了毛主席“关于如何正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告和李富春副总理“关于第二个五年计划的若干问题”说明以后；在会议中又听到周总理“关于访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告”、陈副总理的发言以及陈叔通副主席的政协常委会工作报告和各位的发言，我受到深刻的教育和启发，提高了我的思想认识，我表示完全同意和拥护。
    我是一个民间的职业艺人，现在我所要谈到的也是有关我们戏曲界的几个问题。自从去年实行减免文化娱乐税和文化部发出五百万救济金救济艺人以来，在党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的号召下，我国的戏曲界呈现出空前未有的繁荣，这不只是解决了戏曲艺人的生活，而且，挖掘出许许多多的好的戏目和曲词，这对于丰富人民文化娱乐生活，起了良好的作用，从而，在整理戏曲遗产上有了很大的方便，更扩大了我们戏曲艺人交流经验、互相学习的范围。我相信，在不久的将来，在文艺工作者帮助下，戏曲艺术会有更大的发展。
    从这一点看来，党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”政策是正确的。提高了人民文化娱乐水平，给戏曲艺人们带来了无限的好处。这些情况不用我多说了，大家都可以目睹眼见，是人所共知的事；可是，另外我也感到我们曲艺界存在一些问题，希望有关方面加以注意，我分三点说明：
    一、为了继承曲艺传统的艺术遗产，要与安排、救济相结合，好培养下一代，要求各省、市文化局在可能的条件下，建立“曲艺之家”来解决这个问题。
    最近几年来，在全国各地有不少的文艺工作者，不断地整理曲艺遗产的东西。这些东西就是我们艺人“口传心授”记在脑子里的曲词和评书。例如：陈士和的聊斋，王少堂的水浒和高元钧、宋宗科等的山东快书等等。这样的记录、整理曲艺遗产是好的；可是，这只能把曲艺艺人的东西变成书面的东西，只是继承了曲艺遗产的一部分，或者说是三分之一。因为曲艺遗产包括三种。
    1、是“口传心授”积累在艺人身上的东西，这也就是我上面所说的。
    2、是曲艺艺人表演的经验。
    3、是演唱的伴奏者。
    所以说，只整理、重视第一种是不够的，因为，这三者才构成了“曲艺”，当然这其中也有光说不唱的像评书和相声等形式的曲艺。我们曲艺界有一个损失，那就是在解放前，学这种艺术多半是女演员，尤其在演唱方面，其中有些个是好的，艺术造诣很高的；但其中也有一部分艺术修养是很低，有一些副作用渗杂在内，这样，无形之中就削弱了曲艺艺术，所以，有些个演员在解放后难以提高。就仅有的老艺人来说，艺术修养高的很有限，倘若不及时的把他们身上存在的东西保留下来，又是一层损失，就我所知道的，我们许多曲艺老艺人都表示，愿意把自己身上的东西传给下一代，谁也不愿意把自己身上的东西带到棺材里去，毫无保留的拿出来，既然如此，我希望各省市文化机关重视一下这个工作。
    曲艺这种艺术，短小精悍，通俗普及，形式多样，是个轻便的战斗武器，这种艺术也深受广大人民所喜爱，从最近两三年来看，曲艺这种艺术在工农兵群众中，根深蒂固的发展起来，对于我们的经济建设起着良好的推动作用。最近一、二年来，各省市广播电台、文工团也相继成立了曲艺团、曲艺队等组织，足见这种艺术为人民所喜欢。由于这样发展，就产生了一些问题值得我们重视，这就是如何提高业余演员的艺术水平和伴奏人员逐渐缺乏的情况。提高业余演员艺术水平当然是需要有经验的职业演员来辅导，可是更重要的是音乐伴奏的缺乏。音乐伴奏人员本来是缺乏的，因为，旧有的一个伴奏演员，一个人要给几个表演者来伴奏，由于，一些人员参加了组织，这样，就使得伴奏人员更少了，形成演唱者多、伴奏人员更少的现象，产生“脱销”。照这样下去，情况会日渐严重。所以，我希望在整理传统曲艺遗产的同时，把安排老艺人这工作与培养下一代曲艺艺人结合起来，赶快培养下一代。一个演唱演员可以在比较短的时间内培养出来，可是，一个音乐伴奏人员培养要困难些，如果，不注意这方面的工作，只重视继承艺人“口传心授”的东西，那是不对的，一些好的老伴奏人员的能耐就会带走。这些工作非一朝一夕所能完成的，应快办才对。因此，我建议各省市文化部门，在适当的条件下，可以成立“曲艺之家”来承当这一工作，这种“曲艺之家”可大可小，小者一、二间房也可，大者三、五间房也成。现在一般学校都是二部制，有很大的一部分同学校外活动少，呆着无事，生活内容贫乏，可以让他们参加到这里学习，有培养前途的，将来再继续深造。这样，老艺人可以把身上的东西留下来，也培养了下一代曲艺艺人。这是轻而易举的事，花钱少，收效大。假如不及时办理这件事，损失是很大的。
    二、要求文化部和商业部保存现在的小型娱乐场所，并适当的建设一些小型文化娱乐场所。
    自从去年我国社会主义经济建设改造胜利以来，各地商业部门，为了调整商业网，把门市部集中扩大，而把一些小型的文化娱乐场所、书场、茶馆改成门市部了，这种情况在各地都有发现。长此下去，使得一部分人民的文化娱乐受到影响，而且，也使一部分零散艺人失去了演出场所，生活受到影响，形成半失业的现象，我想，我们政府既然为了救济我们戏曲艺人，也决不想让艺人失业、失去生活来源，这样，会增加政府工作上的困难，让一些有生活之道的人失业。另外，我建议有关方面，建设一些小型文化场所，把旧有的场所保存别动，维持原状。从最近这些年看，各省市建设大的剧场已经不少，可是，对于小型文化场所的建设太少了，这样，太不调和，我想，一些偏僻离城较远地区的人，文化娱乐生活会贫乏，他们势必要到大城市来玩，不单增加交通上的拥挤，也使一些零散艺人生活失去了保障。所以我建议在一些地区，特别是离城较远或厂矿附近多建设一些小型文化娱乐场所。
    三、要求各省市文化机关把零散的曲艺艺人领导起来，加强教育，帮助学习，提高思想水平，好正确的为群众服务。
    自去年各省市文化局有的举办零散曲艺艺人登记、发给演出证，确定他们的职业，成绩是很大的；可是，到现在，还有很多地方的文化局没有作这项工作，或迟迟再拖延。有的地区文化局不管零散艺人，反而让公安部门来管理，这是不好的，不合理的。有的零散艺人反映，人都解放翻了身了，我们翻半个身，跟无娘的孩子一样。因此，我建议各地方文化机关，有的尚未办理零散艺人登记的快一些办理登记，把他们组织起来，发挥他们的作用，为群众服务。
    最后，我希望我们各地曲艺艺人，要在可能的条件下自立更生，还要树立艰苦朴素的作风，因为，我国正在经济建设时期，有些困难还需要大家共同努力克服，现在，又在增产节约时期。当前的任务，我们就是互相学习，交流经验，为繁荣新的曲艺而奋斗，为搞好我们与文艺工作者之间的团结而努力。
