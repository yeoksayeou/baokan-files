Adhere to the Mass Line, Strengthen Ideological Education
Zhang Lie Discusses How to Do a Good Job in Trade Union Work

I am a trade union worker in the Liaoning area. I will briefly express the following points:

Workers' welfare undertakings should be realistic and should not set increased production and frugality against the people's livelihood.

First, in 1956, the workers in the Liaoning area worked very hard and comprehensively overfulfilled the state plan. The total industrial output value of the province exceeded that of 1955 by 41%; labor productivity exceeded 25.1%; profits turned over also exceeded 1.9%; and costs were also reduced. The construction speed of capital construction was faster than in previous years, and 90.5% of the tasks of the first five-year plan have been completed. Workers in other departments such as commerce, transportation, culture, education, and health also worked very well. The biggest shortcomings in the work are many accidents, large waste, and low quality. In 1957, the central task of all workers in Liaoning Province is to launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy. To this end, we will further develop the advanced producer movement, promote advanced experience well, tap the potential of enterprises from reducing accidents, improving quality, and saving raw materials, and strive to comprehensively overfulfill this year's tasks.

It is important to carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and it is especially necessary to regard it as a regular task. Increased production and frugality should never be dispensed with, and everything should be done in the spirit of frugality. However, increased production and frugality do not exclude the material and cultural life of the masses, and should not absolutely oppose increased production and frugality to the lives of the masses. I suggest that the leading comrades of the central industrial departments and factories and mines should not take back the necessary welfare benefits that have already been given to the workers because of the strict implementation of frugality. For those units that made too many promises last year, if some welfare undertakings really cannot be done, they can be realistically changed, but they should be discussed with the masses in advance. As long as you trust the masses, there is nothing that cannot be done; all things that should be done and must be done should be done well, and should not be arbitrarily stopped or not done. It is wrong to arbitrarily cut workers' welfare undertakings. Trade union funds should also not be rashly reduced. Of course, all welfare expenses should not be wasted casually, and should be used well.

Enterprise leaders should follow the mass line and consult with workers on everything.

Second, the relationship between the leaders of most factories and mines and the masses is normal, and they cooperate well with each other, but the relationship between the leaders of a few units and the masses is not good enough. In 1956, about 0.05% of workers in the Liaoning area made trouble. There are many reasons for the trouble, mainly due to leadership bureaucracy and deviations in the implementation of policies. The purpose of the workers' trouble is very simple, mainly to require the leaders of the enterprises to correct bureaucratic work styles and correctly implement the party and state policies and decrees. The demands they put forward are generally reasonable. These problems have also been reasonably resolved. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have a very high prestige among the workers; the workers' awareness is also very high, and their organization and discipline are also very strong. As long as the leaders of the enterprises follow the mass line, consult with the workers on everything, and explain things that the workers do not understand, the workers will not make trouble.

It can be seen from the troubles of a few workers in the Liaoning area that trade union cadres are not allowed to participate in the troubles, and some trade union cadres do not care about these things. This shows that the trade union is still divorced from the masses and has bureaucracy. If the trade union can really actively support their reasonable demands and run around to realize their reasonable demands, they will not make trouble, and if there is anything, they will go to the trade union to solve it; if some workers really make trouble, the trade union cadres should also participate and boldly lead, because "If Zhang San doesn't take charge, Li Si will definitely be the head of the household." If the workers' demands are unreasonable, they can be persuaded, and the masses still trust the trade union. Individual bad elements must make trouble, and they will fall into a completely isolated position.

According to Chairman Mao's instructions, to resolve contradictions among the people, we must proceed from the desire for unity, go through criticism and struggle, and achieve the goal of unity, but some people are unwilling to carry out criticism and self-criticism, are unwilling to consult with workers on everything, like to act arbitrarily, and like to engage in simple matters. After hearing the news that the central government is going to further expand the democratic rights of the masses and improve the democratic system, a few enterprise leaders have many unnecessary concerns, some are afraid that the masses will demand too much; some are afraid that the masses will not understand right and wrong; some are afraid of extreme democracy among the masses. What is there to be afraid of? The workers have great faith in the Party and the People's Government. Guided democracy can negate excessive demands, can distinguish right from wrong, and can correct extreme democracy. What is terrible is that enterprise leaders do not trust the masses and do not follow the mass line.

This year's primary task is to strengthen the political and ideological work of employees.

Third, it is very necessary for us to regard strengthening the political and ideological work of employees as this year's primary task. It is necessary because we must have a strong working class to realize the historical task of building socialism. It must not only have a higher cultural level and scientific and technological level, but also have a high degree of class consciousness and organization and discipline. Generally speaking, the workers' class consciousness is high, and their organization and discipline are strong. However, due to the continuous expansion of the working class ranks, various non-working class ideologies have also been brought into the working class ranks. This non-working class ideology plays a negative role in the working class ranks. Overcoming this negative factor mainly depends on political and ideological work. In 1956, we did not pay close attention to this work and did very little. We must strengthen this work this year. Experience has proven that it is wrong to take a laissez-faire attitude towards the ideological work of the masses, and it is even more wrong to replace persuasion and education with punishment. This work should be regarded as a regular task and incorporated into all tasks. Experience has also proven that educational methods that are divorced from reality and empty slogans are unacceptable, and rational education based on facts should be carried out from the actual thoughts of the masses. Experience has also proven that the one-sidedness of educational content and the impatience in educational work have a negative effect on improving the class consciousness of the masses. Therefore, comprehensive education should be carried out among the masses, and it should be based on the existing level of consciousness of the masses. (Picture attached)

    坚持群众路线　加强思想教育
    张烈谈怎样作好工会工作
    我是辽宁地区的一个工会工作者，我简要地发表如下几点意见：
    工人福利事业应该实事求是，不能把增产节约和群众生活对立起来
    第一、1956年，辽宁地区的职工劳动得很好，全面超额完成了国家计划。全省工业生产总值比1955年超过了41％；劳动生产率超过了25.1％；上缴利润也超过了1.9％；成本也有所降低。基本建设的施工速度比往年都快，已经完成第一个五年计划任务的90.5％。其他如商业、交通运输、文教卫生部门的职工也都工作得很好。工作中最大的缺点是事故多、浪费大、质量不高。1957年，辽宁省全体职工的中心任务是开展增产节约运动。为此，我们将进一步开展先进生产者运动，好好地推广先进经验，从减少事故、提高质量、节约原材料等方面去挖掘企业潜力，争取全面超额完成今年的任务。
    开展增产节约运动是重要的，把它当成一个经常性的任务尤为必要。什么时候也不能不要增产节约，什么事情也都应该以节约的精神去办。但是增产节约并不排斥群众的物质和文化生活，不要把增产节约和群众生活绝对地对立起来。我建议：中央各工业部门和厂矿企业的领导同志，不要因为厉行节约就把已经给了工人的必要的福利待遇再要回来。去年许愿多了的单位，有些福利事业如果真的办不到，可以实事求是的改过来，但是事先要和群众商量，只要相信群众，没有不好办的事；凡是应该办而且又是必须办的事，还应该好好的办，不能随便停办或不办，那种随便斧削工人福利事业的做法是不对的。工会的经费，也不要草率削减。当然，一切福利费用也不应随便浪费，应该用好。
    企业领导者应该走群众路线，有事同工人商量
    第二、绝大部分厂矿企业的领导者和群众的关系是正常的，他们之间合作得很好，但是也有少数单位的领导人员和群众的关系不够好。在1956年，辽宁地区大约有万分之五的工人闹事。闹事的原因很多，主要是由于领导上的官僚主义和在执行政策上有偏差所促成。工人闹事的目的很简单，主要是要求企业的领导者纠正官僚主义作风，正确地执行党和国家政策法令。他们所提出的要求一般是合理的。这些问题也都得到了合理的解决。党中央和毛主席在工人当中的威望很高；工人的觉悟也很高，组织性、纪律性也很强。企业的领导者只要走群众路线，有事和工人商量，工人不明白的事给讲清楚，工人就不会闹事。
    从辽宁地区少数工人闹事中看出一个问题，即闹事时不让工会干部参加，有些工会干部也不去过问这些事。这说明了工会还脱离群众，有官僚主义。工会如果真能积极支持其合理要求，为实现其合理要求而奔走的话，他们就不闹事了，有事也就到工会去解决了；如果有些工人真的闹起事来了，工会干部也应该参加进去，大胆地去领导，因为“张三不作主，李四必当家”。工人们的要求如果不合理，可以进行说服工作，群众还是相信工会的。个别坏分子一定要闹事，他就会陷于完全孤立的地位。
    按着毛主席的指示，解决人民内部的矛盾，要从团结的愿望出发，经过批评斗争，达到团结的目的，但是有人不愿开展批评和自我批评，有事不愿意和工人商量，喜欢独断专行，喜欢简单从事。少数企业领导人员听说中央要进一步扩大群众的民主权利和健全民主制度的消息之后，产生了许多不必要的顾虑，有的怕群众要求过高；有的怕群众是非不明；有的怕群众极端民主。何怕之有？工人们是十分相信党和人民政府的。有领导的民主可以否定过高的要求，可以明辨是非，可以纠正极端民主。可怕的，倒是企业领导人员不相信群众，不走群众路线。
    今年首要工作是加强职工的政治思想工作
    第三、我们把加强职工的政治思想工作当成了今年的首要工作，这是十分必要的。其所以是必要的，因为我们要实现建设社会主义的历史任务，必须有一个强大的工人阶级，它不仅必须具有较高的文化水平和科学技术水平，而且还必须具有高度的阶级觉悟和组织性、纪律性。一般说来，工人们的阶级觉悟是高的，组织性、纪律性是强的。但是由于工人阶级队伍的不断扩大，各种非工人阶级的思想意识也带到工人阶级队伍里来了。这种非工人阶级的思想意识，在工人阶级队伍中起着消极作用。克服这种消极因素，主要是靠政治思想工作。在1956年，我们对这一工作抓的不紧，做的很不够，今年一定加强这一工作。经验证明，对群众的思想工作采取自流的态度是不对的，以惩办代替说服教育的做法更是不对的。应该把这一工作当成经常任务，并把它贯串到各项工作中去。经验证明，脱离实际，空喊口号的教育方式是要不得的，应该从群众的思想实际出发，进行实事求是的说理教育。经验也证明，教育内容的片面性，和在教育工作上的急燥情绪，对提高群众的阶级觉悟起着消极作用，因此，应该向群众进行全面的教育，应该从群众现有的觉悟程度出发。（附图片）
