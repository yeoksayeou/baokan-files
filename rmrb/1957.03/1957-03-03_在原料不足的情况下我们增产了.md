We Increased Production Despite Insufficient Raw Materials
		Cui Shaowu, Director of Harbin Ball Bearing Factory

    After the nationwide production surge last year, the contradiction between supply and demand for raw materials became very acute in our factory.

    The steel materials we received at the national ordering conference were only enough to complete three-quarters of the year's task, and actual supply was often delayed. The most severe shortage was steel plate; the amount allocated to us was only enough to maintain production for a little over one quarter. It was clear that if this problem was not properly resolved, we would be forced to stop production from the third quarter onwards.

    In resolving this problem, there were initial debates: one view was to "determine production by materials," producing only as much as the available materials allowed, or to simply ask for more from above. The other view was to follow the mass line, doing everything possible to save metal consumption, complete state targets, and ensure increased production.

    Obviously, the former view was incorrect. Therefore, we fully mobilized the masses and vigorously launched metal conservation work. As a result, production increased by 5.2% last year, and in January of this year, it increased by another 14%. In thirteen months, we saved more than four hundred and twenty tons of steel materials, and used the saved steel to produce more than one million six hundred thousand sets of ball bearings.

    The main reasons why our factory's raw material saving work was able to achieve such great results are: the Party committee's leadership, the whole factory's involvement, and the earnest implementation of the instructions on "fully tapping the internal potential of enterprises and vigorously carrying out metal conservation work." The specific methods are as follows:

        Fully Utilize Waste Materials

    Throughout last year, we consistently lacked ball bearing steel and steel plate. Steel plate is the raw material for the main accessory of ball bearings – the cage – and without steel plate, finished products cannot be produced. Therefore, we first found a lot of steel plate discs in the scrap pile. We thought that if we could roll these steel plate discs thin, then the difficulty of insufficient steel plate would be solved.

    However, rolling steel plate discs is by no means like "rolling noodles"; we had neither the equipment nor the experience, so problems were inevitable. Therefore, we first found personnel related to this work and formed a temporary "steel plate disc rolling team" to be specifically responsible for solving problems in steel plate disc rolling. At the same time, we found a joint state-private factory with better rolling technology to test rolling. After four tests, and further smoothing the rollers and improving rolling operations, pieces of steel sheet that met the specified dimensions and gloss were finally rolled out. Although it took more than five months from the start of the experiment to its success, and a great deal of effort, the effect was significant. As of the end of January this year, this one measure alone saved more than one hundred and twenty-nine tons of steel plate, solving the material shortage problem for more than two million seven hundred and ninety thousand sets of cages.

    The successful steel plate disc rolling experiment not only encouraged everyone's interest in saving, but also enabled us to begin to find a way to solve the problem of insufficient steel materials. Subsequently, various different waste material utilization groups were organized in the factory. As of January, each group had saved a lot of raw materials or tools. For example, the "steel material saving group," by simply changing larger scrap steel balls into small steel balls and changing scrap long balls into small steel balls, saved twenty-five tons of ball bearing steel since last year, increasing production by eight million five hundred and fifty thousand steel balls. In addition, saving from forging material heads and ball bearing steel cores into ball bearing races was also significant. The "tool saving group" was a saving group formed by employees voluntarily, and over the past year, it has also saved more than thirty-six thousand various tools, which not only saved the metal materials used to make tools, but also alleviated the problem of insufficient tool capacity in our factory. Other groups, such as the "surplus product handling group," also generally cleaned up products that had not been assembled in the past due to incomplete parts, and assembled more than forty thousand sets of ball bearings over the past year. Through concrete organization and mobilization among employees, many vivid saving tips have also emerged. For example, Zhang Xiangwen, a worker in the steel ball workshop, took the initiative to research a method of rolling the waste grinding wheel left over from grinding steel balls in the fine grinding process into powder to replace 320# silicon carbide, saving more than six tons of valuable silicon carbide over the past year. Another example is that technicians and workers in the batch workshop also researched a method of using soapy water to replace gasoline for washing products, which can save six hundred to eight hundred kilograms of gasoline per month.

  The above facts educated everyone and made us deeply realize that fully tapping internal potential is an effective method to solve the problem of insufficient raw material supply. And cleaning up inventory and utilizing waste materials can not only save a lot of good steel, but also prevent good steel that can be used from being treated as waste in the future.

      Improve Design, Improve Technology

    The development of work such as utilizing residual materials and waste materials has strengthened everyone's confidence in solving the problem of insufficient raw materials, and the passive situation in production due to tight raw material supply has begun to change. In the words of Wang Deshan, the supply section chief: "Finding a way to save steel plate made a big stone fall from my heart." However, there was still a big stone in the hearts of the factory leaders, that is, the problem of insufficient ball bearing steel had not been completely solved, and the supply of copper materials was also becoming tight. Therefore, the factory further focused on mobilizing technicians and veteran workers to find ways to improve product design and processing technology. At this time, newspapers and magazines also began to introduce the experience of brother factories in saving raw materials from design and process, which was very enlightening for everyone. After in-depth mobilization and specific organization, since the second half of last year, eight methods for improving product design and process to save raw materials have finally been researched. Among these methods, some have already been implemented, some have been successfully tested, and will be promoted soon, and the economic benefits are very high.

    For example, "cloth tube replaces copper cage" is to cut pressure-molded cloth tubes that meet the size and thickness requirements into circles, and then turn out round holes to replace the cast copper cage. The cage made of this cloth tube is strong and durable, and performs well. According to users, ball bearings made with this cloth tube cage are even better than ball bearings made with copper cages. This one method alone saves more than forty tons of copper a year.

    Others, such as "forging replaces turning bar stock," is to change the original method of turning ball bearing steel bars into ball bearing races into a forging method. This can increase the metal utilization rate by 8%, saving more than seventy-five tons of steel material by January of this year.

    Improving design and improving technology is not an easy task, it requires both equipment and "experts." We learned the operating technology of horizontal forging machines, from transferring old machine tools to repairing them, from repairing them to finding "experts" and learning the technology to officially producing, it took a total of one year and eleven months, and paid a great deal of technical effort, to have today's harvest. At present, all ball bearing races with an outer diameter of fifty to eighty millimeters can be processed using this horizontal forging machine.

    The above facts show that saving raw materials from product design and process is not only necessary, but also a very effective way to save raw materials.

      Improve Management, Rectify Systems, Consolidate Achievements

    In order to enable the raw material saving work to be carried out regularly and persistently, we have also made corresponding improvements in management, and rectified and improved the following systems:

   (1) The quota requisitioning system has been rectified. It is stipulated that raw materials are issued according to quotas, and materials without single-product quotas are issued according to budget. Workshops must not have small private stocks, and the saved materials must be returned to the warehouse once a month. Tools and some materials are also implemented on an exchange-old-for-new basis.

   (2) A waste product management system has been established. The boundaries, types, steps for handling waste products, statistical analysis and management methods of waste products are stipulated. Due to improved technology and strengthened management, the waste rate has dropped from 1.46% at the beginning of last year to 0.45% at the end of the year.

   (3) Material requisition cards have been established, and the reward system has been improved.

    More than a year of practice has told us that vigorously carrying out raw material saving work within industrial enterprises is not only an effective way to solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, ensure the completion of tasks, and increase production, but also an important aspect of educating all factory employees to "run enterprises diligently and thriftily." However, practice has proved that carrying out raw material saving work is by no means a simple matter. The implementation of the above-mentioned saving measures such as our factory's "steel plate disc rolling" and "repairing and using horizontal forging machines" all show that there are many difficulties. This requires us to have the determination and courage to resolutely fight difficulties to the end, and closely rely on the organization and fully mobilize the masses. Only in this way can we overcome all difficulties and ensure the completion of the production increase task.

    在原料不足的情况下我们增产了
    哈尔滨滚珠轴承厂厂长  崔绍武
    去年全国生产高潮到来以后，原材料供不应求的矛盾在我厂暴露得很尖锐。
    当时我们在全国订货会议上分到的钢料，只够完成全年四分之三的任务，而且在实际供应上还经常脱期。这中间最缺的是钢板，我们分配到的数量只够维持一个多季度的生产需要。很明显，这个问题如果得不到适当的解决，第三季度起就有被迫停产的危险。
    在解决这个问题中，开始有争论：一种意见是“以料定产”，有多少料就做多少产品，或者伸手向上面要。另一种意见是走群众路线，千方百计节约金属消耗，完成国家指标和保证增产。
    显然，前一种意见是不对的。因此我们充分发动群众，大力开展了金属节约工作。结果，去年增产了5.2％，今年1月份，又增产了14％。十三个月中就节约了四百二十多吨钢料，用节省下来的钢，生产了一百六十多万套滚珠轴承。
    我厂节约原材料的工作所以能取得这样大的成绩，主要是：党委领导，全厂动手，认真贯彻了关于“充分挖掘企业内部潜力，大力开展金属节约工作”的指示精神。具体作法是这样的：
        充分利用废料
    去年全年，我们一直缺滚珠钢和钢板。钢板是做滚珠轴承的主要配件——保持架的原料，没有钢板是出不了成品的。因此，我们首先从废料堆里找出了不少钢板饼。我们想如果把这些钢板饼辗薄，那么钢板不足的困难就找到解决的门路了。
    但是，辗压钢板饼决不是“辗面片”，我们既没有设备，又没有经验，难免不出问题。于是首先找同这项工作有关的人员，组成了一个临时性的“钢板饼辗压小组”，负责专门解决钢板饼辗压中的问题。同时找了一家辗压技术较好的公私合营工厂来试验辗压。前后经过四次试验，最后，经过进一步修平滚子，改进辗压操作以后，一片片合乎规定尺寸、光度的钢片终于辗出来了。这项措施，从开始试验到成功虽然花了五个多月的时间，费了很大的劲，效果却很大，截至今年1月末止，单这一项就节省了一百二十九吨多钢板，解决了二百七十九万多组保持架的缺料问题。
    由于钢板饼辗压试验成功，不仅鼓舞了大家节约的兴趣，同时也使我们开始找到了解决钢料不足问题的门径。随后，厂内各种不同的利用废料小组就组织起来了。到1月份止，每个小组都节约了不少原材料或工具。如：“钢料节约小组”仅是把较大的废钢球改成小钢球和把废长珠改成小钢珠等两项措施，去年以来，就节约了二十五吨滚珠钢，增产了八百五十五万钢珠。另外料头、滚珠钢料心改锻成滚珠套圈的节约亦不少。“工具节约小组”是职工自动组成的节约小组，一年来也节约了各种工具三万六千多件，不仅节省了做工具用的金属材料，也缓和了我厂工具能力不足的问题。其它如“处理余品小组”也普遍对以前由于零件不全，未组合的产品进行了清理，一年来，也装配出了四万多套滚珠轴承。在职工中，经过具体组织与发动，也出现了不少生动的节约窍门。比如：钢珠车间工人张襄文主动研究出了把细磨工段磨钢球用剩的废砂轮辗成粉末，代替320＃金刚砂的办法，一年来就节约了六吨多贵重的金刚砂。又如：成批车间技术人员和工人也研究出了用肥皂水来代替汽油洗涤产品的办法，每月可以节省汽油六百至八百公斤。
  上述事实教育了大家，使我们深深体会到：要解决原材料供应不足问题，充分挖掘内部潜力是一种有效的方法。而清理库存，利用废料，不仅可以节省许多好钢，也能防止今后把可以利用的好钢当作废料处理。
      改进设计，改进工艺
    利用残料、废料等工作的开展，坚定了大家解决原材料不足问题的信心，生产上由于原材料供应紧张的被动局面开始有了转变。拿供应科长王德山的话来说是：“钢板节约找到了门路，心中一块大石头落了地。”可是厂领导心中还有一块大石头，那就是滚珠钢不够用的问题还未彻底解决，而且铜料供应也紧张起来了。于是厂里又进一步着重发动了技术人员和老工人设法改进产品设计和加工工艺。这时报纸和刊物也开始介绍了兄弟厂从设计和工艺加工上节约原材料的经验，对大家有很大启发。经过深入发动与具体组织，去年下半年以来，终于研究出了八项改进产品设计和工艺过程节省原材料的办法。这些办法中，目前有的已经开始实行，有的已试验成功，不久即可推行，经济效果都很高。
    如“胶布管代替铜保持架”，就是把压力机压制的合乎尺寸厚薄的胶布管，切成圆圈车出圆孔以后，来代替铸铜保持架使用。这种胶布管做的保持架，质体坚韧，性能良好。据用户反映：这种用胶布管保持架作的滚珠轴承，比用铜保持架做的滚珠轴承还好用。仅这一个办法，一年就节省了四十多吨铜。
    其他如“锻加工代替车削棒料”，就是把原来用滚珠钢棒车成滚珠套的办法，改成用锻加工的方法。这样，可以提高金属利用率8％，到今年1月就节省了七十五吨多钢料。
    改进设计改进工艺并不是容易事情，既需要设备，也要有“行家”。我们学习卧式锻造机的操作技术，从调来破旧机床到修复，从修复到找到“行家”和学到技术正式生产，总共费了一年零十一个月的时间，并付出了很大的技术力量，才有今天的收获。目前凡外径尺寸五十到八十公厘以内的滚珠套圈，都能用这个卧式锻造机加工。
    上面的事实说明：从产品设计和工艺上去节省原材料不仅必要，而且是一条节约原材料的十分有效的道路。
      改进管理，整顿制度，巩固成绩
    为使原材料节约工作能够经常持久开展，我们在管理上亦作了相应改进，整顿健全了以下制度：
   （1）整顿了限额领料制度。规定原料按定额发料，材物料没有单件产品定额的就按预算发料。车间不得有小家底，节省下来的材料须一月一退库。工具和部分材料并实行以废换新。
   （2）建立了废品管理制度。规定了废品的界限、种类、处理废品的步骤、废品的统计分析与管理方法等。由于改进了技术、加强了管理，废品率由去年初的1.46％降到年末为0.45％了。
   （3）建立了下料卡片同时，改善了奖励制度。
    一年多来的实践告诉我们：在工业企业内部大力开展原材料节约工作，不仅是解决原材料不足困难、保证完成任务和增产的有效途径，同时也是教育全厂职工“勤俭办企业”的一个重要方面。可是，实践证明：开展原材料节约工作也决不是一件简单的事。上述我厂“钢板饼辗压”、“修复使用卧式锻造机”等节约措施的实现，都说明困难是很多的。这就需要我们有坚决向困难斗争到底的决心和勇气，并紧密依靠组织，充分发动群众。只有这样，才能战胜一切困难，保证完成增产任务。
