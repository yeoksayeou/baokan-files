Universities and colleges across the country are actively implementing the policy of running schools through diligence and thrift, saving expenses in all aspects.

Last semester, many universities and colleges across the country established specialized inspection teams to conduct inspections on personnel allocations, teaching buildings, equipment, office supplies, water, electricity, and food. They found that waste was still quite common, especially in equipment and food, where waste was relatively serious. Currently, many universities and colleges have established organizational structures to lead the work of streamlining and saving, and have already formulated preliminary plans for saving. Xi'an Medical College originally planned to add 60 microscopes, but after rationally arranging experiment time, it no longer needs to add any equipment to meet the needs. Anhui Agricultural College plans to reduce various administrative expenses by 10,000 yuan within a year and save more than 23,400 catties of grain. Chongqing University's furniture budget for the entire school this year has been reduced from more than 126,000 yuan to more than 66,000 yuan, a reduction of nearly one-half from the original plan. Xi'an Normal College originally planned to build 7,000 square meters of houses this year, but now it has been reduced to 1,400 square meters. The Materials Supply Section of Jiaotong University studied the cutting methods of lecture notes and documents, saving 30 reams of newsprint in one month. Teaching assistants in the Department of Chemistry at Nankai University used the winter vacation to manufacture chemical reagents for teaching experiments, saving the state 2,500 yuan. Sichuan College of Finance and Economics came up with many ways to save food, saving more than 80,000 catties of grain from January to November last year alone.

In order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient school buildings, many schools are actively adjusting existing buildings and renovating houses based on the principle of streamlining and saving. Leaders of Beijing Normal University, Central China Agricultural College, and Central China Institute of Technology moved their offices to relatively simple houses, and many faculty and staff members also voluntarily proposed reducing their housing area to solve the problem of teaching and student housing. Sichuan College of Finance and Economics built and renovated some grass-roofed and mud-walled houses, which cost about half as much as ordinary new civil houses.

Middle schools in various places are also actively implementing the policy of running schools with diligence and thrift, and many teachers are making teaching aids to save expenses. Chengdu No. 3 Junior Middle School has used the school's original materials or waste materials to manufacture 26 sports equipment items in the past two years, saving nearly 500 yuan. The school also saved a sum of office expenses and added tools worth about 1,000 yuan to the school's metalworking and woodworking factory. Li Yaobin, a teacher at Chengdu No. 10 Middle School, prepared and manufactured 110 pieces of visual aids. In order to solve the problem of the lack of teaching instruments, middle schools in Chengdu also adopted the method of cooperation and mutual borrowing to overcome the difficulty of insufficient equipment. Forty middle schools in Shenyang City have already made more than 1,000 teaching aids.

    杜绝浪费、紧缩开支
    各地大中学校勤俭办学
    本报讯  全国各大、中学校积极贯彻勤俭办学方针，从各方面节约开支。
    上学期，全国许多高等学校成立了专门性的检查小组，对人员编制、教学用房、仪器设备、办公用具、水电、粮食等各方面作了检查，发现浪费现象还相当普遍，特别是仪器设备和粮食方面，浪费是比较严重的。目前许多高等学校成立了领导精简节约工作的组织机构，并且已经订了节约的初步计划。西安医学院原计划增加六十架显微镜，经合理安排实验时间，不再增加任何设备，就可以满足需要。安徽农学院计划在一年内减少各项行政开支，节约一万元，并计划节约粮食二万三千四百余斤。重庆大学今年全校的家具预算已由十二万六千多元，减为六万六千多元，比原计划减少近二分之一。西安师范学院原计划今年修建七千平方公尺的房屋，现缩减为一千四百平方公尺。交通大学材料供应科研究了讲义文件的剪裁方法，一个月就节约了白报纸三十令。南开大学化学系的教学辅助员利用寒假制造了为教学实验用的化学药品，为国家节省资金二千五百元。四川财经学院想出了许多节约粮食的办法，仅去年1至11月节约了粮食八万多斤。
    为了克服校舍不足的困难，本着精减节约原则，许多学校积极调整现有用房和改建房屋。北京师范大学、华中农学院和华中工学院的领导人把办公室迁移到比较简陋的房屋里，不少教职员也自动提出减少住房面积，解决教学用房和学生用房问题。四川财经学院兴建和改建了一些草顶夹壁的房屋，这些房屋的造价比一般新建民房降低了一半左右。
    各地中学也在积极贯彻勤俭办学的方针，许多教师制造教学用具，节省开支。成都市第三初级中学两年来，利用学校原有的材料或废料制造了二十六件体育用品，节约了近五百元。学校还节约了一笔办公用费，为校内金工木工厂添置了值一千元左右的工具。成都市第十中学教师李尧彬，配制和制造了直观教具一百一十件。成都市各中学，为了解决教学仪器的缺乏问题，还采取了彼此合作，互相借用的办法，克服了设备不足的困难。沈阳市有四十所中学，已经制作了千余件教具。
