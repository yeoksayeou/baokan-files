    Last year was a year of extremely strained transportation. Congestion on railways, highways, and ports was very serious. Although efforts were made in all aspects, capital construction projects, industrial and agricultural production, and the supply of people's daily necessities in some areas were still affected to some extent by transportation congestion. Transportation this year is still very strained. On the railway front, the throughput capacity of lines such as Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan, Lanzhou-Xinjiang, Baoji-Lanzhou, Binbei (Harbin-Bei'an), the northern section of Beijing-Hankou, the northern section of Tianjin-Pukou, and the western section of Longhai are nearing saturation. The phenomenon of transportation volume exceeding throughput capacity is a prominent contradiction. On the highway front, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Tibet are all very strained. There are still some strained situations in water transportation. These all show that striving to avoid traffic congestion and striving for smooth transportation is still a major task for the transportation sector and all economic sectors at present.
    How can we avoid traffic congestion and strive for smooth transportation? The most fundamental way, of course, is to carry out capital construction and increase transportation capacity. Because the growth of transportation capacity lags behind the growth of transportation volume, this is the main reason for transportation congestion. In the past few years, when using construction funds, the transportation sector did not consider the most urgent needs of the national economy at the time, which prevented some transportation capacity that should have been increased and could have been increased from being increased in time.
    This year, the transportation sector's capital construction plan has been appropriately adjusted and transportation capacity has been increased according to actual needs. For example, in water transportation, management of the Sichuan River transportation has been strengthened; on the railway front, the technical transformation of existing railways has been listed as a priority. But simply having such a plan is not enough. When implementing this plan, it is also necessary to implement the principle of focusing funds on key areas. Taking the railway as an example, in addition to ensuring the construction of lines urgently needed by the national economy such as the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, the focus of new railway construction should be placed on the unfinished projects of already-laid lines such as the Baoji-Chengdu Railway and the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, striving for these lines to be handed over to operation as soon as possible and to exert their transportation capacity. The technical transformation of existing railways should focus on projects that directly improve throughput capacity, first meeting the current transportation needs. As for projects such as electrification that meet long-term needs, they can be postponed. A large part of this year's transportation tasks will rely on the early completion of projects currently under construction. It is hoped that the workers engaged in transportation construction will strive to complete this year's plan ahead of schedule.
    The state's construction funds are limited, and currently the capital construction investment of the transportation sector can only be mainly used to increase throughput capacity. Therefore, in addition to the transportation capital construction sector closely focusing on the current needs of transportation to arrange and strive to complete the capital construction plan ahead of schedule, the transportation production sector must also strive to tap potential, avoid transportation congestion, and strive for smooth transportation.
    In which aspects is transportation potential expressed? Generally speaking, there are two aspects: one is that the transportation sector must strengthen transportation organization; the other is that all consigning units must save transportation capacity.
    In recent years, although the level of transportation organization has been continuously improved, the waste of transportation capacity caused by poor planning and improper scheduling is still alarming. Last year, the non-productive berthing time of Yangtze River ships in various ports reached 54.58%. This means that last year, ships on the Yangtze River had to berth for one day for every day they sailed. On the railway, on the one hand, there is a shortage of locomotives and vehicles, and on the other hand, shunting accidents last year increased by about 50% compared with the previous year, with more than 3,000 extra wagons being used every day at one point. If we earnestly strengthen transportation organization and tap this obvious transportation potential, many problems can be solved.
    To strengthen transportation organization, from a broad perspective, it is particularly necessary to strengthen combined land-water transportation and utilize civilian transportation tools. Although the quantity of the trial implementation of combined land-water transportation of grain last year was not large, because the transportation plan and receiving plan were uniformly arranged, the connection between vehicles and ships was close, which was very effective in accelerating the turnover of materials and the turnover of transportation tools. At present, all departments should pay more attention to combined land-water transportation, so that various transportation tools can be connected to each other, so as to gradually expand the scope of combined land-water transportation. Civilian transportation tools are a force that cannot be ignored. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 3 million tons of wooden sailboats and more than 180,000 professional animal-drawn vehicles in the country. However, this part of the force has not been fully utilized in the past. For example, Jiangsu Province has 400,000 tons of wooden sailboats, but the utilization rate is only 60%, and the actual load rate is only 55%. According to statistics from 14 provinces, there are still more than 40,000 professional animal-drawn vehicles that have not participated in transportation. This batch of forces should be organized to give full play to their role.
    For all consigning units, planned transportation and reasonable transportation should be adhered to. At present, the phenomenon of unreasonable transportation is still very serious. According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Railways, unreasonable transportation last year increased by more than 25% compared with the previous year, accounting for 8.4% of the total transportation volume for the year, and consuming an average of 4,000 to 5,000 freight cars every day. Most of the unreasonable transportation can be avoided and should be avoided. For example, last year, some construction enterprises in the Lanzhou area transported more than 80,000 tons of building materials such as sand, stone, bricks, and tiles from Guangzhou, Jilin, Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, and other places. Obviously, if the principle of local material collection is seriously implemented, these materials would not be purchased from places thousands of miles away.
    Strengthening transportation organization and adhering to planned transportation and reasonable transportation are all old problems. Why can't they always be solved well, and how should they be solved in the future? In addition to strengthening specific organizational work, the most important thing is to strengthen ideological work. Some comrades in the transportation sector usually pay more attention to some specific indicators of their own department, while neglecting to transport the consigned materials to their destination as soon as possible. Taking the port as an example, port staff usually talk about how many hatches are carrying out loading and unloading operations every day, how efficient the work shifts are, what the cost is, etc. As long as they can complete these indicators, they don't care much about how many ships are lining up at the port and unable to unload their cargo. It should be said that these comrades are only playing a small abacus, and not a big abacus. To tap transportation potential well and accelerate the turnover of materials, it is necessary to fight against this kind of local view. For consigning units, what hinders further strengthening planned transportation and reasonable transportation is the lack of an idea of saving transportation capacity. They always demand not to be bound by the transportation plan. Only by overcoming this idea can potential be tapped.
    Since the phenomenon of transportation congestion occurred in many places last year, the leadership of local Party committees and people's committees over transportation work has been strengthened compared with the past. In the future, it is particularly necessary to strengthen political and ideological work, help the transportation sector and various consigning units overcome local views, properly arrange transportation plans, and adhere to planned transportation and reasonable transportation. The Party committees and people's committees in the areas where major stations and ports are located should also pay attention to organizing urban transportation work to avoid creating congestion in transportation hub areas. In addition, the current capacity of the transportation sector to repair automobiles and ships is still insufficient. In addition to the First Ministry of Machine Building actively providing support, local Party committees and people's committees should also mobilize local machinery industries to provide support.
    Whether transportation can be smooth has a great impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. It is hoped that all relevant departments and personnel will pay attention to this issue, avoid congestion, and strive to keep transportation unimpeded.

### 努力使运输畅通

    努力使运输畅通
    去年是运输极其紧张的一年。铁路、公路和港口堵塞的现象十分严重。虽然经过各方面的努力，有些地区的基本建设工程、工农业生产和人民生活必需品的供应仍然在一定程度上受到运输堵塞的影响。今年的运输仍然是很紧张的。铁路方面，石太线、兰新线、宝兰线、滨北线、京汉北段、津浦北段、陇海西段等线路的通过能力已接近饱和。运输量大于通过能力是突出的矛盾现象。公路方面，甘肃、青海、新疆、西藏都很紧张。水上运输方面仍然有若干紧张情况。这些，都说明努力避免交通堵塞，争取运输畅通，还是交通运输部门和各个经济部门当前的一项重大任务。
    怎样避免交通堵塞，争取运输畅通呢？最根本的办法当然是进行基本建设，增长运输力量。因为运输力的增长落后于运输量的增长，是运输堵塞的主要原因。过去几年，由于交通运输部门在使用建设资金的时候，没有更多地结合国民经济当前最迫切的需要来考虑，曾经使得一些应该增强、也可以增强的运输能力没有及时增强。
    今年，交通运输部门的基本建设计划，已经根据实际需要，适当地调整和增强运输能力。例如，在水上运输方面加强了对川江运输的管理，铁路方面已经把现有铁路的技术改造列为重点。但是仅仅有了这样的计划还是不行的。在执行这个计划的时候，还要贯彻重点使用资金的原则。拿铁路来说，新建铁路除了保证包兰路等国民经济迫切需要的线路的建设以外，应该把重点放在宝成路、兰新路等已经铺轨的线路的未完工程上，争取这些线路早日移交营业，发挥运输能力。现有铁路的技术改造应该把重点放在直接提高通过能力的工程上，首先满足当前的运输需要，至于电气化等适应远景需要的工程可以往后挪一挪。今年有很大一部分运输任务，要依靠目前建设的工程早日完工来担负。希望从事交通建设的职工，努力提前完成今年的计划。
    国家的建设资金是有限的，目前交通运输部门的基本建设投资主要的还只能用在增强通过能力方面。因此，除了交通运输基本建设部门要紧紧围绕着运输的当前需要，来安排和努力提前完成基本建设计划以外，交通运输生产部门还必须努力挖掘潜力，避免运输堵塞，争取运输畅通。
    运输潜力表现在哪些方面呢？大体说来有两个方面：一是交通运输部门要加强运输组织工作；一是各个托运单位要节约运输力。
    几年来，运输组织工作的水平虽然是不断提高的，但由于计划不周和调度不当而造成的运输力量的浪费还是惊人的。去年长江船舶在各港非生产性停泊时间达54.58％。这就是说，去年长江的船只，航行一天，就要停泊一天。在铁路上，一方面是机车车辆不足，另一方面去年的调车事故却比前年增加了50％左右，有一个时期每天多用车皮三千多辆。如果切切实实地加强运输组织工作，把这部分显而易见的运输潜力挖掘出来，是可以解决很多问题的。
    加强运输组织工作，从大的方面来看，特别要加强的是水陆联运工作和利用民间运输工具。去年试行的粮食水陆联运，虽然数量还不多，但由于运输计划、接运计划是统一安排的，因而密切了车、船衔接，对加速物资的周转和运输工具的周转都很有成效。目前各个部门对水陆联运应该更加重视，使各种运输工具互相衔接，以逐步扩大水陆联运的范围。民间运输工具是一支不可忽视的力量。据不完全的统计，全国木帆船共三百多万吨，专业兽力车有十八万多户。而这部分力量，过去是没有充分发挥作用的。例如，江苏省有四十万吨木帆船，利用率仅达60％，实载率只有55％。另据十四个省的统计，还有四万多辆专业兽力车没有参加运输。这一批力量应该加以组织，充分发挥它们的作用。
    对于各个托运单位应该坚持计划运输和合理运输。现在不合理运输的现象还很严重。据铁道部不完全的统计，去年不合理的运输比前年增加25％以上，占全年运输量的8.4％，平均每天要耗用货车四千辆到五千辆。不合理的运输有大部分是可以避免和应该避免的。例如，去年兰州地区的有些建筑企业就从广州、吉林、徐州、郑州等地运了八万多吨砂、石、砖、瓦等建筑材料。显然，如果认真贯彻就地取材的方针，是不会到千里以外的地方去采购这些材料的。
    加强运输组织工作，坚持计划运输和合理运输，都是老问题了。为什么总是不能很好地解决，今后怎样解决呢？除了加强具体组织工作之外，最重要的是加强思想工作。交通运输部门有些同志通常总是更多地关心本部门的一些具体指标，而忽略了尽早地把托运的物资运到目的地去。拿港口来说，港口工作人员通常谈论的总是每天有多少舱口进行装卸作业，工班效率如何，成本如何等等，只要能完成这些指标，再多的船只排在港口卸不下货来，他们是不大在意的。应该说，这些同志只打了小算盘，而没有打大算盘。要很好地把运输潜力挖掘出来，加速物资周转，必须同这种局部观点作斗争。对托运单位来说，障碍进一步加强计划运输和合理运输的，是缺乏节约运力的思想。他们总是要求不受运输计划的约束。一定要克服这种思想，才能挖掘出潜力来。
    自从去年许多地方发生运输堵塞的现象以后，各地的党委和人民委员会对交通运输工作的领导比过去加强了，今后特别需要加强政治思想工作，帮助交通运输部门和各个托运单位克服局部观点，妥善安排运输计划，坚持计划运输和合理运输。各个主要车站和港口所在地的党委和人民委员会还要注意组织市内运输工作，避免造成运输枢纽地区的堵塞现象。此外，现在交通运输部门修理汽车和船舶的能力都还不够，除了第一机械工业部应该积极给以支援以外，各地党委和人民委员会也应该动员地方机械工业给以支援。
    运输能否畅通，对国计民生的影响很大，希望一切有关的部门和人员都来注意这个问题，避免堵塞，努力使运输畅通。
