Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 8th (TASS dispatch) - Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, issued a statement in Paris on the current international situation and the tasks of the peace movement.

Joliot-Curie pointed out that the great hope brought about by the easing of international tensions has now been replaced by the unease caused by the deterioration of international relations. The conflicts in the Middle and Near East, the Hungarian event, the intensified arms race, and the re-emergence of distrust have once again caused concern among the public in various countries. The Cold War is making a comeback. It manifests itself in various forms. The Cold War is undermining trust between countries and between peoples, and is damaging normal relations between people.

In his statement, Joliot-Curie pointed out that the Austrian government's decision to ban the activities of the Secretariat of the World Peace Council in Austria is unjustified and harmful, and its purpose is to obstruct the worldwide peace movement; because experience in recent years has shown that maintaining peace and easing international tensions depends, first and foremost, on the organized and highly vigilant actions of the people of all countries.

He then pointed out that the main task of the peace movement is not to investigate who should be held responsible for the conflict or the threat of conflict, but to peacefully resolve conflicts and promote mutual understanding between countries and between peoples.

Joliot-Curie said that the forces of peace must resolutely oppose the revival of the Cold War. The peace movement cannot flinch from this task, because the meaning of the peace movement lies in this. The peace movement has many times, in serious times, assisted in educating the public and awakening them to take effective action to reverse dangerous situations.

Even today, despite the trend of deteriorating international relations, more and more people are still supporting the proposition of disarmament and the abolition of military bloc systems. In addition, it is undeniable that the good results achieved during the period of easing tensions, such as everything related to improving economic and cultural relations, have been maintained.

Joliot-Curie emphasized that if every peace-loving person shows initiative, then a new, deeper, and more reliable period of easing international tensions will come before us.

However, the enormous danger that the accumulation of various types of atomic weapons, hydrogen bombs, and missiles that can be launched to any location on Earth could bring to mankind is constantly growing.

Some people believe that the existence of atomic weapons will prevent local conflicts from turning into world wars, and therefore regard atomic weapons as a guarantee against world wars. This idea is a big mistake.

In fact, accelerating the accumulation and improvement of such weapons can only make those who at some point believe they are stronger more enthusiastic about launching wars.

He said that we should tirelessly call on the people to remain vigilant, not to let the people be complacent with the terrible threat of atomic weapons, and to make everyone realize that this threat is intolerable, so that governments will have no choice but to agree to take effective disarmament measures and immediately ban the testing and use of atomic weapons.

The excitement caused by the news of the upcoming test explosions is extremely great, and therefore the time has come when we can strive to ban such explosions as long as we make new efforts.

We welcome and support actions against testing atomic weapons around the world.

Joliot-Curie emphasized that the peace movement will further develop its activities, continue to do everything possible to uphold the cause of peace, and promote the success of all actions that make it possible for mankind to return to the path of peace.

### 约里奥—居里发表声明  号召进一步开展和平运动  坚决反对恢复冷战，争取国际局势缓和

    约里奥—居里发表声明
    号召进一步开展和平运动
    坚决反对恢复冷战，争取国际局势缓和
    新华社讯　塔斯社巴黎8日电：世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里在巴黎发表了关于目前国际形势与和平运动任务的声明。
    约里奥—居里指出，国际紧张局势缓和所带来的巨大希望现在已经被国际关系恶化所引起的不安所代替。中近东的冲突、匈牙利事件、加紧备战的行动和不信任的重新出现，又使各国公众感到忧虑。冷战又卷土重来。它以各式各样的形式表现出来。冷战破坏着国和国之间以及各国人民之间的信任。并且损害着人和人之间的正常关系。
    约里奥—居里在声明中指出，奥地利政府禁止世界和平理事会书记处在奥地利活动的决定是毫无理由的和有害的，其目的是阻挠全世界的和平运动；因为近几年来的经验证明，维护和平和缓和国际紧张局势首先取决于各国人民有组织的高度警惕性的行动。
    他接着指出，和平运动的主要任务不是追究谁应该对冲突或冲突的威胁负责，而是和平解决冲突，促进国与国和人民与人民之间的相互谅解。
    约里奥—居里说，和平力量必须坚决反对复活冷战。和平运动不能在这项任务面前退缩，因为和平运动存在的意义即在于此。和平运动已经有许多次在严重的时机中协助教育公众，唤醒他们采取有效行动以扭转危险局势。
    甚至在今天，尽管有国际关系恶化的趋向，但是仍然有越来越多的人拥护裁军和取消军事集团体系的主张。此外，不容否认，紧张局势缓和时期所取得的良好结果，例如与改善经济和文化关系有关的一切，还是保持下来了。
    约里奥—居里着重指出，如果每一个爱好和平的人都表现了积极性，那末国际局势的一个新的、更深刻的和更可靠的缓和时期，就会来到我们面前。
    可是，积累各种类型的原子武器、氢弹、和可以投到地球任何地点的导弹所可能给人类带来的巨大危险，正在不断增长。
    某些人认为原子武器的存在，会使地方冲突不致于变为世界大战，因此就把原子武器看作是防止世界大战的保证。这种想法是大错了。
    实际上，加速积累和改进这类武器，只可能使那些在某个时候认为自己比较强大的人更加热中于发动战争。
    他说，应当不倦地号召人民保持警惕，不要让人民安于原子武器可怕的威胁，应当让大家都认识到这种威胁是不可容忍的，从而使各国政府也不得不同意采取有效的裁军措施和立即禁止试验和使用原子武器。
    即将进行试验爆炸的消息所引起的激动是极其巨大的，因而只要我们作出新的努力就可能争取到禁止这种爆炸的时机已经到来了。
    我们欢迎和支持世界各地反对试验原子武器的行动。
    约里奥—居里强调指出，和平运动将进一步开展自己的活动，继续全力维护和平事业和促进一切使人类有可能重新走上和平道路的行动得到成功。
