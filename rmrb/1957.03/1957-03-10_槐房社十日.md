Huaifang Commune: Ten Days
By Our Reporter, Fu Dong

The commune director took me around the fields for quite a while. As he walked, he introduced, "This is all newly reclaimed paddy field from last year. In the past, this kind of alkaline land was used to grow sorghum, yielding only thirty or forty catties per mu. After being converted into paddy fields, even with a not-so-good harvest, it still yielded two shi five or six per mu... This is our newly built canal, which can irrigate one thousand mu of land... That's the drainage ditch, so we won't be afraid of heavy rains in the future..."

The water in the canal flowed slowly. Not far away, we saw water bubbling up from below, like a spring. The commune director said, "These are the bamboo tube wells we dug, and water flows out of them all year round. In 1956, we dug eighty-two, and this year we will dig seventy-one more." As he said this, he pointed into the distance and said, "Look, isn't someone digging a well over there?"

From the commune director, I learned that Huaifang Township in the suburbs of Beijing is not an advanced township. Only two agricultural production cooperatives were established in the winter of 1953, one with seventeen households and the other with eleven. In the autumn of 1954, the two cooperatives merged and expanded to four hundred and twenty-seven households. By the time it was converted into an advanced cooperative in the winter of 1955, the entire cooperative had increased to one thousand and one households. In that year, another one thousand mu of paddy fields were opened up. Now, the entire cooperative has two thousand eight hundred and seventy-one mu of paddy fields, one thousand three hundred and eighty-seven mu of vegetable fields, and six thousand one hundred and twenty mu of dry land. Last year, there was heavy rain, and a lot of the dry land was waterlogged. However, each household still received an average of three hundred and ninety-eight yuan.

As we walked and talked, we saw piles and piles of麻包 (woven hemp bags) in front of a house from a distance. As we got closer, we heard the rumbling of machines. It turned out to be a rice mill. The machine was quick, and in no time, it milled the rice into clean white rice.

We arrived at the greenhouse. Rows and rows of glass windows sparkled in the sun. The room was full of tomatoes, large and red, tempting to look at, let alone eat. These greenhouses are all newly built, a total of two hundred and sixty rooms. Xie Hongliang, a fifty-seven-year-old vegetable growing "expert" and greenhouse technician, said that he had never seen such good tomatoes in his life, with each room yielding sixty catties – previously, yielding twenty catties per room was considered good.

People introduced me to the chives, which were fresh, yellow, tender, and a foot tall. They said: It's not bragging, such chives are the best in Beijing this year.

I also saw the tofu workshop and the pigsty, where many pigs were so fat that their bellies were almost dragging on the ground. There were too many things to see, and I didn't finish seeing them all even on the day I left.

I went to visit Guo Jingming, a poor peasant. He is a technician in the chive greenhouse.

After arriving in Huaifang Township, I often heard people talk about this old man, and also often heard people talk about the dozen or so mu of land outside his window. When the old man was young, he heard his father say that there used to be many houses of the emperor on the land outside the window. Later, the Manchu emperors fell. The people who watched the houses for the emperor dismantled the bricks and tiles and sold them. His father, despite being ill, crawled on the ground, throwing out the broken bricks and tiles bit by bit. After finally clearing it so that it could be cultivated, the person who had watched the gate for the emperor said that the land was his and that rent had to be paid to cultivate it. In this way, rent was paid for decades. The debts incurred were not paid off even by the time of liberation.

The old man never imagined that there would be such a day when these sixteen mu of land would belong to him. The land was so good, and the children had grown up, so he thought he would grow more vegetables! More money could be earned, and he was good at it. But he lacked fertilizer, waterwheels, and livestock. He dared not grow many vegetables, only one or two mu. It was not until 1954, when he became a member of the cooperative, that the land was filled with dark purple eggplants, green spinach, zucchini, cabbage… He himself began to specialize in growing vegetables, not caring about anything else.

The vegetables, in the past two years, have grown extraordinarily well. For example, cabbage, yielding as much as ten thousand catties per mu, five times higher than before liberation. The chives in the greenhouse increased from one hundred and fifty catties (when working individually) to three hundred catties per畦 (raised bed)! They are so lovable to look at! What method did the old man use to increase production? People wanted to know. Guess how he answered? He said: "In the past, everyone grew their own crops, and everyone thought they had their own methods, and no one told anyone else. In fact, what each person knew was only a little bit. Now the vegetables are grown by four technicians discussing together, how could they not grow well!"

Someone came into the room, and the old man continued, "You see, this is the benefit of joining the cooperative. He is going to drive the cart to deliver vegetables to the vegetable company. In the past, one person from each household had to go; now, one thousand households only need two people. You calculate how much manpower is saved just from this!"

The old man's eyes lit up when he talked about the two "electric wells" in the vegetable field: "Hey, one is worth ten waterwheels! If we hadn't joined the cooperative, who could have used this?"

As he was speaking, a group of children crowded into the room. Guo Jingming happily said: The first two are his eldest daughter and second daughter, and the ones behind are his fourth son and fifth son. They are back from school. His two eldest sons have joined the army, and his third son works at the feed company. These two daughters used to work in the fields during the day and attend night school in the evening. This year, because he alone can earn more than ten fen a day (watching the greenhouse at night, one o'clock is one work point), he sent them to school. I saw that the children were all dressed neatly, the two older ones wearing floral cotton-padded jackets with short cotton-padded coats with long fur collars; the younger ones were also dressed neatly.

The food was brought to the炕 table, and it was meat dumplings. The old man insisted on pulling me to taste one. He said, "Today the third son, who works at the feed company, came back, so we made some dumplings. Now the cooperative distributes rice, wheat, sweet potatoes, corn, cabbage… to every household. Every household is eating a variety of things. In the past, if you didn't grow it in your own field, how could you eat it?" After a pause, he added, "Life is a bit wasteful! We should be more frugal in the future."

As he ate, the old man slowly said, "The year we joined the cooperative, there was a flood, and the rain filled the roads in the village with five or six inches of water. I worried for many days, but who knew that at the end of the year, I received twice as much money as in previous years. In 1955, the old corn, rice, sweet potatoes, cabbage, radishes, and pickled vegetables that were distributed were so much that the small earthen house could hardly hold them all. The year before, some people advised me to build a few rooms, but I refused and invested the money in the cooperative. But the number of people in the family is increasing year by year, and I have some extra money myself, plus there are people in the cooperative who know carpentry and bricklaying; so, you help a little, he helps a little, and a dozen people built five brick rooms with glass windows in less than a week, and even some of the partitions used glass."

The old man looked out the window and continued, "The path of the cooperative is the right one. But, is there not a single shortcoming? That's not true either. The land outside the window was idle for two months in 1956. Originally, we planned to grow small white cabbage, but later we heard that a club was going to be built, so we stopped. As a result, the club was not built, and the land was wasted… This year, twenty mu of sweet potatoes were frozen. The garlic was not harvested in time, and a lot of it was ruined."

It was completely dark, and Guo Jingming had to go to the greenhouse. As he walked out, he said, "These things can be fixed as long as they are corrected. Alas, it's really not easy to manage a family! You think we are always racking our brains to manage a family of a few people! Now the cooperative cadres are managing the family of a thousand households, and it's only the first year, how can they not make any mistakes!"

People introduced me to find Wang Donghai, a poor hired peasant. He grows a good hand of rice, and has been growing it for twenty years. People said: Although it is now the slack season, it is not easy to find him – he is either harvesting lotus roots or milling rice.

Coincidentally, there was a strong wind one day, and I got up early again, thinking of intercepting him at his house. Luckily, I found him.

He said, "Now I'm busy, but not as worried as before. When I was working for the landlord, I was busy all year round, but I never had enough to eat. After being allocated land and working for myself, I was busy borrowing waterwheels and livestock all day long. After finally borrowing them, I had to rush to feed the livestock, draw water, and release water. After finishing this, I had to rush to level the land and transplant seedlings. How could one person manage all this! I had to ask someone to help, but who had time during the busy farming season? By the time they had time to transplant the seedlings, it was too late, so I couldn't help but harvest a lot less rice… Now the cooperative has electric rollers (motors), electric waterwheels, steel mills, and tractors. It's not as hard to work as before, and it's not as worrying."

He paused and asked me, "Have you seen the newly opened paddy fields? The land was opened up beautifully, and it only took more than a month. This year, thanks to the opening of this paddy field, otherwise with so much rain, how could we have distributed so much money!"

"Of course, there are also shortcomings. The higher-ups didn't pay close attention, the fertilizer was not applied in time, and the sprouts were raised late, so one mu only yielded two and a half shi. If it had been managed well, one mu could have yielded at least three shi this year… There are also some inconveniences in life, for example, the firewood distributed is only enough to burn for a month. If you go to the Beijing Timber Factory to get some shavings and kindling to burn, the cooperative's vehicles are too busy. To buy grain, you have to run several miles to the grain supply station, which will delay half a day of work. To eat some fresh vegetables, you also have to run to the Huaifang vegetable station…"

"But, these inconveniences, compared to my big conveniences, are nothing!" He pointed to the food in the bowl and said, "Whether the cooperative is good or bad, don't ask adults, ask the children in the village, and they can answer very correctly."

I also went to see Zhang Wenzhou, a middle peasant. He is a team leader in the youth team, an active student in night school, an excellent teacher in the pithead literacy group, and also the director of the cooperative's theater troupe.

Before joining the cooperative, the Zhang family had eight mu of irrigated land and four mu of orchard land. The couple worked hard for a year, and the income was not bad, but life was very difficult. When the zucchini came down in June and July, they had to get up in the middle of the night to sell vegetables in the city. After selling them and returning, they sometimes didn't even have time to eat, and had to go to the fields to harvest vegetables. After the vegetables were loaded onto the cart, it was dark again, and after closing their eyes for a while, they had to get up to feed the livestock and travel. The woman was busy with work in the fields, and the children were left unattended, getting sick every now and then; as a result, the money earned through hard work was mostly sent to the hospital. After joining the cooperative in 1954, he earned more than four hundred yuan after working for a year. His woman mainly takes care of the children at home. Now the children are free from illness and disaster, and the adults are also happy. They plan to put the children in the nursery when they are completely well, and the woman will also go to the fields to work.

He said that he didn't recognize many characters before. In recent years, especially after joining the cooperative, he has had more free time in the evening and can concentrate on studying. Now he has recognized more than four thousand characters. He can even read the scripts for Beijing operas. If he were still working on his own, working day and night, he probably wouldn't be able to recognize so many characters in his whole life! He said that not only are all the children of school age attending school in the cooperative, but even many old men and old women have joined the pithead literacy group.

"There are also small inconveniences in life. Like eating vegetables, in the past, if you wanted to eat green onions, you could just pull one from the field; now you have to go to the vegetable station to buy them. But, then again, how could we eat so many different kinds of grains as we do now! Spending a little change is not as convenient as it used to be. But if we tighten our belts, we can get by. We can really buy some big things during the Spring Festival! Besides, if life is too tight on weekdays, we can still borrow money from the credit cooperative."

People in the cooperative said that Sun Deguang's family is one of the richest middle peasants in the cooperative. I went to take a look, and indeed the atmosphere was different. Both the outer and inner rooms were piled with large bags of grain. There was also a new-style clock on the table.

Sun Deguang and his wife and six children originally had twelve mu of dry land and eight mu of irrigated land. He had been working on his own, and only joined the cooperative at the end of 1955 when the entire township was collectivized. His wife, Zhang Xiuying, said that in the past, the chives grown by his family would be as thick as chopsticks in February; the corn would grow taller than the eaves of the house. After joining the cooperative, when she went to the fields, she saw that the grass was two feet high, and no one cared about it, and the chive leaves were all ruined. Talking about this stirred up her worries. They talked about how the couple used to get up at the fifth watch (3-5 am) and sleep in the middle of the night to work in the fields. "When weeding, no matter how hot the sun was or how heavy the rain was, we never rested. The children also came to the fields to help after school…" "Now the people in the team are not united, you work hard, others fool around, how can the land be cultivated well!"

"They don't even consult with everyone on how to cultivate the crops!" Sun Deguang said that the cooperative just kept "imparting" the instructions from the district downwards, and as a result, the cotton and large peppers were all planted too densely, and nothing was harvested. Many of the cabbages in the twentieth team were frozen, and he suggested not to put them in the cellar first, otherwise they would rot if put in the cellar all at once. However, the commune director didn't consider other people's opinions and just said, "Put them in the cellar!" Because of this, all the cabbages rotted."

As he talked about this, he touched the 炕 (heated brick bed) and said unhappily, "Firewood is also distributed according to labor power, look, the 炕 is as cold as a stone. In the past, there were plenty of corn stalks and cotton stalks in the fields, and we couldn't burn them all."

As he was speaking, a child came over and pulled his mother's clothes, probably wanting money to buy candy. This made her even more upset: In the past, when we grew our own vegetables, we always had pocket money. When our man went to sell vegetables, he would always bring back some candy or biscuits for the children! We didn't care about the children spending three or two mao. Now we have to think twice even about one or two fen."

From the land, they also talked about the cart, which was also a source of trouble for the couple. They said that when the cart was in the cooperative, it was used to haul ditch mud for fertilizer, and it was ruined beyond recognition. If it was our own thing, no one would be so careless!

Sun Deguang talked about this, and after a while, he said again, "I'm saying this because I have livestock, a cart, and good land; for those who didn't have livestock or a cart before, it's still good, they don't have to borrow from east to west anymore. Taking accumulating fertilizer as an example, who could apply eight thousand to ten thousand catties of fertilizer per mu when working individually? At most, it would be two or three thousand catties." His woman also chimed in at this time: "It would be good if our family had two laborers." She said, "Before, when we cultivated our own land, I was worth a full laborer, the land was right in front of the house, I could work, come back to feed the baby, and then go again. In the past, the two children could go to the fields to pick cotton, change the ridges, or weed after school. Now they can only play at home."

"The path of collectivization is right. Collectivization is like a good book, but unfortunately some people in some places read it wrong." Finally, Sun Deguang said this.

I have been away from the Huaifang Commune for several days. Even today, I still often think of the lively scene of commune members crowding into the supply and marketing cooperative to buy things; I think of the bricks and wood for building new houses piled in front of many commune members' homes. I also cannot forget the commune members saying, "The path of collectivization is the right one." However, there are still many things to be done on this path: Why doesn't the cooperative consult with everyone when making plans? Why can't some sideline jobs be found for those women who can't work in the fields? (Attached picture)

    槐房社十日
    本报记者　傅冬
    社主任带着我在地里转了好一阵了。他一面走，一面向我介绍：“这都是我们去年新开的稻地。过去这种碱地种高粱，一亩只能打三、四十斤，开成了稻田，收成不算好，一亩还打了二石五六。……这是我们新开的水渠，能浇一千亩地。……那是泄水沟，以后雨再下的大，也不怕了。……”
    渠里的水缓缓地流着。走不多远，就看到有水从下面冒上来，像泉水一样。社主任说：“这是我们打的竹管井，一年四季有水冒上来。1956年我们打了八十二个，今年还要打七十一个。”说到这里，他用手指着远方说：“你瞧，那儿不是有人正在打井吗？”
    从社主任的嘴里知道：北京郊区的这个槐房乡，不是什么先进乡。1953年冬天才成立了两个农业生产合作社，一个十七户，一个十一户。1954年秋，两个社合并并扩大到四百二十七户；到1955年冬转为高级社的时候，全社已经增加到一千零一户。这一年，又开了一千亩稻田。现在，全社有二千八百七十一亩稻田，一千三百八十七亩菜田，六千一百二十亩旱地。去年雨下得大，旱地涝了不少。可是，平均每家还分了三百九十八元。
    我们边走边谈着，远远地看见一座房前堆着一大堆一大堆的麻包。走近了还听到机器轰隆隆响，原来是个碾房。机器就是不慢，三下两下，就把稻子碾成白净净的米了。
    我们来到了暖房。长排长排的玻璃窗被太阳照得闪闪发光。屋子里堆满了西红柿，个儿大，皮儿红，别说吃，看了都馋得慌。这些暖房都是新盖的，一共有二百六十间。暖房技术员，五十七岁的种菜“把式”谢鸿亮说，他长了这么大，还没见过这么好的西红柿，一间出六十斤——早先，一间出二十多斤就算不错了。
    人们介绍我去看韭菜，鲜黄水嫩的有一尺来高。他们说：不是吹，这样的韭菜在北京城今年算拔尖儿的。
    我又看了豆腐坊和猪圈，好些猪胖得肚子都快拖到地上了。要看的东西太多，一直到我走的那天，也没看完。
    我去贫农郭景明家串门。他是韭菜暖房的技术员。
    我到槐房乡后，常听人谈到这老头儿，也常听人谈到他窗外的那十几亩地。老头儿小的时候，听爹爹说过，窗外那块地上原来有好多皇帝的房子。后来满清皇上倒了。给皇上看房子的人就拆下好砖瓦卖了。爹爹带着病，爬在地里，一点一点把碎砖烂瓦扔出去。好容易清理出来能种地了，那个给皇帝看门的人说，这块地是他的，要种得交租子。就这样，交了几十年租。拉的债到解放的时候也没还清。
    老头儿没有想到有这么一天，这十六亩地归了自己。地土是这么好，孩子也拉扯大了，多种几亩菜吧！卖的钱多，自己也在行。可是肥料、水车、牲口，样样没有。他不敢多种菜，只种了一、二亩。一直到1954年当了社员，这地里才长满了黑紫黑紫的茄子，绿油油的菠菜、西葫芦、白菜……。他自个儿也专门种起菜来，不管别的了。
    菜，这两年长的是出奇的好。像白菜，一亩竟出来了一万斤，比解放前高出五倍。暖房的韭菜一畦由一百五十斤（单干的时候）提高到三百斤。看着都爱死人！老头儿用什么法儿增的产？人们都想知道。你猜他怎么回答？他说：“以前各人种各人的，自己都以为自己有一套，谁也不告诉谁。其实各人知道的不过是那么一点点。现在的菜是四个技术员在一块儿合计着种的，怎么会种不好！”
    屋里走进来个人，老头儿接着说：“你看，这就是入社的好处，他要赶车给蔬菜公司送菜。要在过去，一家得去一个人；现在，一千户只要两个人就行了。你算算看，光这就省了多少人力！”
    老头儿一谈到菜地里的两眼“电井”，就眉飞色舞：“嘿，一个顶十个水车！要不入社，谁家能用上这？”
    正说着话，屋里拥进一伙孩子。郭景明高兴地说：前面的两个是他的大闺女、二闺女，后面是他的四小子和五小子。他们放学回来了。两个大儿子都参军了，老三在饲料公司工作。这两个闺女，原先白天下地，晚上上夜校。今年，他一个人一天就能挣十几分（夜里看暖房，一点钟就是一个工分），就把他们送到学堂去了。我看孩子们都穿得挺干净利落，大的两个穿着花棉袄，外面都披着件有长毛绒领子的短棉大衣；小的也穿戴得很整洁。
    饭端到炕桌上来了，是肉馅饺子。老头儿一定要拉我尝一口。他说，“今天在饲料公司作事的三小子回来，就捏了点儿饺子。现在社里给家家都分了大米、麦子、白薯、玉米、白菜……。家家都吃的花稍了。要在早先，自个地里没有种，那能吃得上？”说完停了停，他又加了一句：“生活过得有点儿浪费呢！以后要节约节约。”
    老头儿一面吃，一面慢悠悠地说：“入社那年，涝了，雨下得连乡里的大路都积了五、六寸的水。我心里嘀咕了好多天，哪知道到年底一算，拿的钱比往年多了两倍。1955年分的老玉米、稻米、白薯、白菜、萝卜、咸菜，多得小土房几乎都放不下了。头年就有人劝我盖几间房，我不肯，把钱投到社里了。可家里人口一年年在加，自己手头也不是没富余钱，加上社里有人会木工活，有人会作瓦工；就这样，你帮一下，他帮一把，十几个人没用一个星期功夫，就盖好了五间砖房，全装上了玻璃窗，连隔扇有的地方也用的是玻璃。”
    老头儿脸朝着窗外看了看，接着说：“合作社这道儿是走对了。但是，是不是没一点缺点呢？也不是的。窗外那块地，1956年就闲过两个月。原先打算种小白菜来着，后来听说要盖什么俱乐部，就停下来了。结果，俱乐部没盖，地也荒了。……今年有二十亩白薯冻了。蒜，到时间没收拾，也糟蹋了不少。”
    天已经完全黑了，郭景明要上暖房去。他一面往外走一面说：“这些事，只要改了，就没事了。唉，当个家也真不容易呵！你想我们管一个几口人的家都常伤脑筋呢！现在社干部当的是一千户人家的家，还是头一年，怎么能一点错都不犯呢！”
    人们介绍我去找找贫雇农王东海。他种的一手好稻子，种了二十年了。人家说：现在虽然是农闲，可是要找他却不容易——他不是去收拾藕，就是去碾米。
    碰巧有一天刮大风，我又起了个早，想到他家截住他。总算运气好，找着了。
    他说：“现在忙是忙，但不像以前那样操心了。给地主干活的那阵，整年忙，整年没吃饱过。分了地自个儿干，整天忙着借水车，借牲口，好不容易借到手了，又得忙着喂牲口，拉水，放水。忙完了这，又忙着平地栽秧。一个人怎么能忙得过来呀！只好找人帮个忙，农忙时谁有空？等到人家有空了，去插秧，又太晚了，这样就不能不少打好多稻子。……现在社里又是电滚子（电动机）、电力水车、又是钢碾子、拖拉机。干活不像早先那么费劲，也不那么伤脑筋了。”
    他停了一下，问我：“你去新开的稻地看过吗？那地开的真漂亮，只用了一个多月的功夫就开好了。今年多亏开了这稻地，不然雨这么大，哪还能分这么多钱！”
      “当然，毛病也不是没有。上面没抓紧，肥料上的不及时，芽子也养晚了，一亩只打了两石半。要是收拾得好，今年一亩顶少也能打三石。……生活上也有些不方便，比方：分的柴火只够烧一个月。去北京木材厂拉点刨花劈材来烧吧，社里的车太忙。买粮食，得跑几里路到粮食供应站，要耽误半天工。吃点新鲜菜也得跑到槐房菜站。……”
      “可是，这些不方便，比起我的大方便来，算得了什么呢！”他指着碗里的饭菜说：“合作社是好是坏，别说大人，问问村里的娃娃，他们都能答得很对。”
    我还去看过中农张文周。他是青年队的一个组长，夜校的积极学员、坑头识字组的出色教员，还是社里剧团的导演。
    入社以前，张家有八亩水浇地、四亩园地。夫妇俩忙一年，收入不算坏，可生活却过得很狼狈。到6、7月西葫芦下来的时候，半夜就得起来进城卖菜。卖了回来，有时连饭都顾不上吃，又得到地里去收拾菜。等菜装上车，天又黑了，闭一下眼，又得起来喂牲口、赶路。女人忙地里的活，孩子扔下没人管，三天两头生病；这一来，辛辛苦苦赚来的钱大都送给医院了。1954年入社以后，干了一年，得了四百多块钱。他女人主要在家管孩子。现在孩子没病没灾，大人心里也痛快了。他们打算等孩子完全好了，放在托儿所，女人也到地里去。
    他说，早先他不识几个字。这几年，特别入社后，晚上的空闲时间多了，能专心一意念书，现在他已认得四千多个字了。排个评剧，剧本也都能看下来。要是还单干，黑夜当白天，一辈子恐怕也识不了这么多字！他说，社里不但该上学的娃娃都上学了，连老头、老太太很多也加入坑头识字组了。
      “生活中间也有小小不方便的地方。像吃菜，以前想吃葱了，就到地里拔一根；现在得到菜站去买。可是，话又说回来了，以前那能像现在这么各样粮食都吃得上！花点零钱，是不像早先那么方便了。但紧一紧也就过来了。过春节的时候，可真能置一些大东西呢！再说，平日生活实在太紧了，还可以到信用社借钱。”
    社里的人说，孙德广家是社里有数的富裕中农之一。我去一看，果然气氛不同，外间、里间屋都堆着大口袋粮食。桌上还有一个新式座钟。
    孙德广夫妇和六个孩子原有十二亩旱地、八亩水浇地。他一直单干，到1955年底全乡都合作化了，才入社。他的妻子张秀英说，往常他家种的韭菜，到二月天，长得就像筷子一样粗；玉米长得高过了房檐。入社以后，到地里一看，草长得有二尺高，也没人管，韭菜叶子全糟蹋了。谈到这里，勾起了她的心事。他们讲到过去夫妻俩怎么起五更睡半夜地去地里干活。“拔草的时候，不管太阳晒得多热，雨多大，从没歇过。孩子放学回家也到地里帮忙”……。“现在队里人心不齐，你卖力，别人糊弄，这怎么能把地种好呢！”
    “庄稼该怎么种，也不找大伙商量商量！”孙德广说，社里只一个劲儿把区里的指示往下“贯”，结果棉花、大辣椒都种的太密了，没收什么。二十队的白菜有好多冻了，他建议先别入窖，不然，一下子入窖准烂。可是，社主任不考虑考虑别人的意见，就说：“入窖吧！”这一弄，白菜统统烂了。”
    他谈到这里，摸了摸炕，很不愉快地说：“柴火也按劳动力分，你看，炕冷得像石头一样。往年，棒子秆、棉花秆地里有的是，烧也烧不完。” 
    正说着，一个孩子过来拉他妈的衣襟，大概是要钱买糖。这一下，她又难过起来了：过去自个儿种菜，零花钱没断过。我们当家的去卖一回菜，回来总要给孩子带点糖果呀，饼干呀！孩子们花个三毛二毛的，我们没当回事。现在要一分、二分钱，也不得不打打算盘了。”
    从地又谈到大车，这也是他们夫妻俩心上的一块病。他们说，车到社里，拉沟泥积肥，毁的不像话了。要是用自家的东西，谁也不会那么不经心！
    孙德广讲到这里，过了一会又说：“我这是有牲口、有车、地好的人说的话；对原先没牲口没车的人讲，那还是好，他们不要东借西借了。再拿积肥说，单干的时候谁能一亩地上八千到一万斤肥？顶多也不过二、三千斤。”他女人这时也插话了：“要是我们家有两个劳动力就好了。”她说：“以前自己种地，我顶一个全劳动力，地就在家跟前，做一做，回来给娃娃喂一喂奶，又去了。两个孩子，以前放了学可以到地里摘摘棉花、改改畦口，或者薅薅草。现在只好在家玩了。”
    “合作化这道儿是对。合作化就好比是本好书，可惜有些人有些地方给念错了。”最后，孙德广这样说。
    我离开槐房社好几天了。一直到今天，我还常想起社员们在供销社挤着买东西的热闹场面；想起好些社员家门口堆的盖新房用的砖和木料。我也不能忘记社员们说的“合作化这条道儿是走对了”的话。可是，这道儿上还有好些事要我们去做：为什么社里订计划的时候不找大家商量商量？为什么不可以给那些不能下地的妇女找点副业活儿干干？（附图片）
