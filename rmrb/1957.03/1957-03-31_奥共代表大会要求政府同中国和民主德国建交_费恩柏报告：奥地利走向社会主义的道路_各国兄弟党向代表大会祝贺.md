Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 30th: The 17th Congress of the Austrian Communist Party continued on the 29th. The congress unanimously passed a motion demanding that the Austrian government formally recognize the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic and establish diplomatic relations with these two countries.

    Austrian Communist Party Central Committee Secretary Fühnberg delivered a report at the meeting on the 29th entitled "Austria's Path to Socialism." In his report, Fühnberg stated that the characteristic of the current situation in Austria is that the bourgeoisie is trying to consolidate its class rule. He criticized the Austrian Socialist Party for spreading illusions among workers about achieving socialism through a revisionist path. Fühnberg emphasized: "The possibility of peacefully transitioning to socialism mentioned in the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union does not mean abolishing the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat, nor does it mean abolishing the theory that socialism can only be established on the path of the dictatorship of the proletariat."

    Fühnberg said: "When we mention the possibility of a peaceful transition to socialism, we mean that the working class must, through its current struggles, make it impossible for the bourgeoisie in the future, amid the turbulence of a social revolution, to forcibly obstruct the working class from taking the necessary measures to eliminate capitalism and establish socialism." He added: But the question of a peaceful transition to socialism is not yet on the agenda in Austria today. He pointed out, "The view that socialist victory can be achieved simply through election campaigns and election achievements is revisionist nonsense." He further pointed out that the possibility of a peaceful transition to socialism will depend on the specific conditions of the Austrian working class's struggle and the development of the international situation. The key to the struggle between the Austrian working class and the bourgeoisie today lies in making it impossible for the bourgeoisie to resort to new fascist forms to save itself when its rule faces a crisis.

    Regarding parliamentary politics, Fühnberg said that the task of Austrian communists is to win over the forces of the petty bourgeoisie to the side of the proletariat. He also said that one of the decisive means of establishing and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance is to implement land reform.

    Fühnberg concluded by pointing out that in order to advance towards socialism by leaps and bounds, Austrian communists firmly believe that the working class must unite on the basis of Marxism.

Xinhua News Agency, March 30th: According to TASS, Vienna: The 17th Congress of the Austrian Communist Party began its discussions on the afternoon of the 28th. The delegates who spoke described the work of their party organizations, courageously exposed errors and shortcomings, and pointed out ways to overcome them.

    Executive Chairman and member of the Political Bureau of the Austrian Communist Party Central Committee, Lauscher, read out the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the congress. The delegates welcomed the congratulations from the fraternal Communist Party of China with prolonged and enthusiastic applause.

    The delegates welcomed the address by the representative of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, member of the CPSU Central Committee Ponomarev, with thunderous applause. He said that for nearly forty years, the Austrian Communist Party has been bravely defending the interests of the Austrian working class and all working people, and defending the national interests of Austria. The Austrian Communist Party has chosen the path of struggle for socialism, taking into account both the common principles of Marxism-Leninism and the experience of other countries in building socialism, as well as the national characteristics and traditions of its own country, which is precisely the path that can achieve the most effective results.

    Subsequently, the Executive Chairman read out a telegram from the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, which congratulated the delegates to the congress and expressed regret that the Austrian authorities did not allow the delegation from the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party to come to Austria.

    Lauscher suggested sending a telegram of salute to the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, expressing the Austrian communists' solidarity with the struggle of the Hungarian comrades and the cause of socialist construction. The congress unanimously adopted this proposal.

    奥共代表大会要求政府同中国和民主德国建交
    费恩柏报告：奥地利走向社会主义的道路
    各国兄弟党向代表大会祝贺
    据新华社柏林30日电　奥地利共产党第十七次代表大会29日继续举行。大会一致通过了一项动议，要求奥地利政府正式承认中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国，并且同这两个国家建立外交关系。
    奥地利共产党中央委员会书记费恩柏在29日的会议上作了关于“奥地利走向社会主义的道路”的报告。费恩柏在报告中说，奥地利当前形势的特点在于资产阶级力图巩固它的阶级统治。他批判了奥地利社会党在工人当中散布的通过修正主义道路走向社会主义的幻想。费恩柏着重指出：“在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会中所提到的和平过渡到社会主义的可能性，并不是意味着取消无产阶级的革命斗争，也不是意味着取消这样的理论：社会主义只有在无产阶级专政的道路上才能建立起来。”
    费恩柏说：“当我们提到和平过渡到社会主义的可能性时，我们是说，工人阶级必须通过目前的斗争，使资产阶级将来不可能在社会革命的动荡中以武力阻挠工人阶级采取必要的措施，来消灭资本主义和建立社会主义。”他又说：但是和平过渡到社会主义的问题今天在奥地利还没有提到日程上。他指出，“有人认为可以简单地通过竞选宣传和选举成就而达到社会主义的胜利。这种见解是修正主义的胡说。”他又指出，和平过渡到社会主义的可能性将决定于奥地利工人阶级斗争的特殊条件和国际局势的发展。今天奥地利工人阶级同资产阶级之间的斗争的关键，在于使资产阶级不可能在它的统治发生危机时重新使用新的法西斯形式来挽救它。
    关于议会政治，费恩柏说，奥地利共产党人的任务是要把小资产阶级的力量争取到无产阶级这一边来。他又说，建立和巩固工农联盟的决定性手段之一是实行土地改革。
    费恩柏最后指出，为了向社会主义大踏步前进，奥地利共产党人坚决认为，工人阶级必须在马克思主义的基础上团结起来。
    据新华社30日讯　据塔斯社维也纳讯：奥地利共产党第十七次代表大会28日下午开始讨论。发言的代表们叙述了自己的党组织的工作，勇敢地揭发了错误和缺点，指出了克服的道路。
    执行主席、奥共中央政治局委员劳歇尔宣读了中国共产党中央委员会给代表大会的贺电。代表们以经久不息的鼓掌欢迎兄弟的中国共产党的祝贺。
    代表们以暴风雨般的鼓掌欢迎苏联共产党代表、苏共中央委员波诺马烈夫致词。他说，将近四十年以来，奥地利共产党一直英勇地捍卫着奥地利工人阶级和全体劳动人民的利益，捍卫着奥地利的民族利益。奥地利共产党选定了争取社会主义斗争的道路，既考虑到马克思列宁主义的共同原则和别国建设社会主义的经验，也顾到本国民族特点和传统，这正是可以取得最有成效的结果的道路。
    随后，执行主席宣读了匈牙利社会主义工人党中央的电报，电报向代表大会代表们表示祝贺，并对奥地利当局不让匈牙利社会主义工人党代表团前来奥地利一事表示遗憾。
    劳歇尔建议向匈牙利社会主义工人党发出致敬电，表示奥地利共产党人声援匈牙利同志们的斗争和社会主义建设事业。代表大会一致通过了这项建议。
