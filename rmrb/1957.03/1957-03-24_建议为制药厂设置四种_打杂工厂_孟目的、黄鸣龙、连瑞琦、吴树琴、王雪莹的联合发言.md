We fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation on several issues regarding the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan, particularly the point about "organizing collaboration and some factories should do odd jobs." On this matter, we would like to offer our views and some suggestions for the consideration of the committee members.

We believe that "odd job factories" can be diverse and service-oriented. Some specialize in providing raw materials to other factories; another type comprehensively utilizes by-products from other factories to produce raw materials needed by another factory, or directly manufactures daily necessities. Because the supply of raw materials and the treatment of by-products are serious challenges faced by many factories, especially pharmaceutical factories, establishing odd job factories specifically for pharmaceutical factories to solve these difficulties will allow pharmaceutical factories to focus on drug manufacturing, quality improvement, and the trial production of new products, which is beneficial to the development of the pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, we suggest establishing four types of odd job factories:

	I. Chemical Raw Material Factory.
	II. Fermentation Factory.
	III. Raw Material Processing Factory.
	IV. By-Product Comprehensive Utilization Factory.

I. Reasons for establishing a Chemical Raw Material Factory: Pharmaceutical factories cannot obtain raw materials from larger chemical factories because large chemical factories produce fewer types and larger quantities, targeting industries such as dyes, rubber, metallurgy, and fertilizer. However, pharmaceutical factories require many types of raw materials with special properties, and the quantity needed is relatively small. Large chemical factories cannot manufacture them, and medium-sized chemical factories only manufacture general industrial chemical raw materials. Therefore, the current manufacturing methods in pharmaceutical factories are uneconomical and unreasonable. Some drugs require manufacturing the needed raw materials from basic raw materials like "toluene," and then using these raw materials to make drugs. This creates many technical difficulties, requires unnecessary equipment and unnecessary unit operations, which increases management costs and overall cost. Establishing small-scale odd job factories to solve the above difficulties for pharmaceutical factories and normalize their operations is quite necessary.

II. Reasons for establishing a Fermentation Factory: Pharmaceutical factories need many raw materials made by fermentation, such as citric acid and gluconic acid. Currently, the supply is very difficult, and self-manufacturing is required. However, there is a lack of knowledge in fermentation chemistry, resulting in very low yields.

III. Reasons for establishing a Raw Material Processing Factory: Pharmaceutical factories manufacturing tablets and injections require various excipients, such as talc powder, starch, dextrin, sucrose, oils, etc. Even if they can be bought on the market, their quality does not meet the purity requirements of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, and they must be used reluctantly, resulting in poor product quality and unattractive appearance. Moreover, the impurities contained in the excipients also affect the shelf life of the products. If we were to be strict, the aspirin tablets we currently produce cannot meet international standards. Furthermore, malt extract cod liver oil has poor nutritional value because malt extract is unavailable and is replaced with maltose syrup. The manufacture of penicillin injections requires cold-pressed vegetable oil, which is not available domestically, so commercially available vegetable oil is decolorized and used as a solvent, resulting in a more irritating finished product. Such situations cannot be improved without establishing odd job factories.

IV. Reasons for establishing a Comprehensive Utilization By-Product Factory: The manufacture of chemical drugs often results in large quantities of by-products, which cannot be sold or utilized and cannot be disposed of in rivers, making disposal very difficult. For example, some pharmaceutical factories manufacturing "phenacetin" have no way to deal with the remaining "ortho-nitrochlorobenzene," and have nowhere to store it, so they have to dig wells and bury it. After the rainy season, it seeps into farmers' water wells, causing poisoning. In the end, they have to add a lot of equipment to process it into photographic materials for sale. The by-product "para-nitroazobenzene" left over from the manufacture of chloromycetin by the Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory has not found a way out to this day. It is a pity to discard these by-products. If a comprehensive odd job factory can be established to process and utilize them, it can solve the raw material needs of other factories and manufacture daily necessities. Some by-products are often the main raw materials of other factories. If good organization and communication can be established, it will be of great significance to material utilization and conservation. We welcome criticism and suggestions regarding the feasibility of the above suggestions. (Attached image)

　　建议为制药厂设置四种“打杂工厂”
　　孟目的、黄鸣龙、连瑞琦、吴树琴、王雪莹的联合发言
    我们完全同意李富春副总理关于第二个五年计划建议的若干问题的说明中有关“组织协作某些厂子应当打杂”就这个问题提出我们的看法和一些建议，请各位委员予以指教。
    我们认为：“打杂工厂”可以设多种多样的，并且是服务性质的，有一些专为其他工厂提供原料；另一种是综合利用其他工厂的副产品制成另一工厂所需的原料，或直接制成日用品，因为原料的供应和副产品的处理，是很多工厂尤其是制药厂所存在着严重困难的问题，专为制药厂成立打杂工厂解决上述的困难使药厂能专心致力于药品的制造和质量的提高及新产品的试制，有利于制药工业的发展。为此建议成立四种打杂工厂。
    一、化工原料厂。二、发酵工厂。三、原料加工厂。四、副产品综合利用工厂。
    一、成立化工原料厂的理由：制药厂不能从规模较大的化工厂取得原料，因为大的化工厂出品种类少，产量大，如染料、橡胶、冶金、肥田粉等厂为供应对象，但制药厂所需的原料种类多，性质特殊，用料比较少，大的化工厂不能代为制造，中型化工厂也只制造一般工业化学原料，因此目前制药厂的制造方法是很不经济，并且不合理，有些药品须从“甲苯”等原始的原料制造所需用的原料，再将此项原料造成药品，技术上困难很多，又需增加不必要的设备和不必要的单元操作，管理费用和成本也就提高，成立小型打杂工厂，给制药厂解决上述的困难，使药厂正常化，颇有必要。
    二、成立发酵工厂的理由：制药厂需要很多原料是用发酵方法制成的，如枸橼酸、葡萄糖酸等目前供应很困难，须设法自制，又缺乏发酵化学的知识，收到率很低。
    三、成立原料加工厂的理由：药剂工厂制造片剂、注射剂需要多种赋形药，如滑石粉，淀粉、糊精、蔗糖、油脂等，在市场上就是能买到，但其品质均不合中国药典的纯度规定，只好勉强应用，因此出品质量差，外表不美观，又因赋形药中含有的杂质多，也影响了制品的保存期限。严格要求的话，我们目前生产的阿司匹林片不能达到国际标准。又如麦精鱼肝油由于得不到麦精，用饴糖代替、营养价值很差。制造盘尼西林注射剂需用冷制的植物油，国内买不到，就用市售植物油脱色作溶剂，制成品的刺激性较大。这种情形非成立打杂工厂是无法改进。
    四、成立综合利用副产品工厂的理由：制造化学药品常常得到大量的副产品，既不能出售利用又不能置之河流，处理非常困难，例如：某些药厂制造“非那西汀”所余的“邻位硝基氯苯”无法处理，又无处存放，只好掘井埋藏，经过雨季、渗透至农民的水井中，以致发生中毒的情形，最后只好增加许多设备，将它制成照像材料出售。东北制药厂制合霉素所余副产品“对硝基偶氮苯”迄今没有出路。这些副产品弃之可惜，如成立综合打杂工厂加工利用，便可解决其他工厂所需的原料，制成日用品，有一些副产品常常是其他厂的主要原料，如果能够很好地组织沟通，对于物质的利用和节约的意义是很大的，以上建议是否可行，提请批评指教。（附图片）
