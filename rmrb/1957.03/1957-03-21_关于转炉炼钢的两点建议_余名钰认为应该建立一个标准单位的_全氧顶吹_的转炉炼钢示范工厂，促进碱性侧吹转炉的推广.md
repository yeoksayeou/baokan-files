Regarding Two Suggestions on Converter Steelmaking
Yu Mingyu believes that a standard unit "full oxygen top-blown" converter steelmaking demonstration factory should be established to promote the application of alkaline side-blown converters.
　　In the past decade or so, I have been engaged in converter steelmaking; therefore, my desire to maximize the economic benefits of converter steelmaking in the process of socialist industrialization is very strong. Please allow me to share my immature opinions on converter steelmaking, and I hope that the committee members and comrades will give me guidance.
　　Due to the improvements in the converter steelmaking method, which have improved the quality of converter steel, international views on converter steel have changed from the previous attitude of abandonment to the belief that it is a promising steelmaking tool. At a time when industrial construction is just beginning in our country and scrap steel is very scarce, it is very beneficial to expand the production of converter steel; this is generally recognized and supported by most steelmakers in our country. Although this view has received various responses, in fact, no positive action has been seen to expand the production of converter steel. My personal view of this contradiction is that it is caused by different evaluations of various converters.
　　Among the three types of converters, "bottom-blown," "side-blown," and "top-blown," the number of those who support the use of oxygen and steam-mixed alkaline bottom-blown converters is the smallest, so in reality, there are two different main arguments: "side-blown" and "top-blown."
　　Those who advocate "top-blown" believe that "full oxygen top-blown" converter steelmaking is the most advanced method currently available. In order to quickly catch up with the advanced world level, this steelmaking method should be used to expand production, without taking more detours to research and improve other converters and steelmaking methods.
　　"Full oxygen top-blown" alkaline converter steelmaking does have superior characteristics for producing steel with particularly low phosphorus, nitrogen, and hydrogen content, and it is an advanced new achievement; we should catch up and try to establish a demonstration factory for this steelmaking method in the shortest possible time. On the one hand, we should absorb the methods that have already been achieved in various countries for production, and on the other hand, we should conduct research and improvement on the existing basis. Then, after a few years, our country's "full oxygen top-blown" steelmaking method will not only be able to catch up with the advanced world level, but also have the possibility of surpassing it.
　　With such a standard unit output "full oxygen top-blown" steelmaking demonstration factory, we can thoroughly analyze the production cost and application range of this steelmaking method; then, from the demand of our country for various steel grades, we can derive the most economical and reasonable amount of several steel grades to be made by this method, and then make a promotion plan for this steelmaking method. Therefore, to use this steelmaking method to increase steel production, it is very necessary to establish a demonstration factory as soon as possible.
　　According to existing data, the "full oxygen top-blown" method uses pig iron with a relatively low phosphorus content to make steel with particularly low phosphorus, nitrogen, and hydrogen content. If this is the only achievement, then the promotion of this method will not be too wide; because on the one hand, it is limited by the supply of low-phosphorus pig iron, and on the other hand, general open-hearth grade construction steel does not currently require such high specifications. Therefore, there is still much research and improvement work to be done on this steelmaking method.
　　Another advantage of the "full oxygen top-blown" method is the high furnace temperature, which allows the addition of scrap steel to reduce costs. This advantage cannot be utilized in our stage of lacking scrap steel; conversely, during the blowing process, the amount of oxides carried out from the furnace flue is very serious, which increases the metal blowing loss and affects the cost of steel. Although active efforts are now being made to collect the oxides in the furnace flue and add them back to the furnace after treatment, it cannot be considered that this shortcoming has been fundamentally solved, and further research and improvement is needed.
　　The "full oxygen top-blown" method must have a large-scale, state-of-the-art oxygen plant to supply low-cost oxygen; otherwise, the cost of steel will be unimaginably high. Our country cannot manufacture it now, and foreign countries have not yet manufactured this new type of oxygen plant in large quantities, so to promote this method to increase production, it is not only necessary to pay a large amount of foreign exchange, but even if the use of foreign exchange is allowed, it is feared that so many oxygen plants cannot be obtained. Therefore, to promote this steelmaking method, it is necessary to determine its annual output and then start manufacturing the latest type of oxygen plant ourselves.
　　To summarize the above points, we should quickly establish a standard unit "top-blown full oxygen" converter steelmaking demonstration factory, but the conditions for the comprehensive promotion of this steelmaking method are far from sufficient.
　　Those who advocate "side-blown" believe that in recent years, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the government, our country has made considerable and outstanding achievements in alkaline side-blown converter steelmaking; we should use these achievements as soon as possible to expand production and accelerate the process of socialist industrialization.
　　Alkaline "side-blown" converters can use various pig irons with unlimited high and low phosphorus content as raw materials to make construction steel that meets national open-hearth standards; they can also use low-phosphorus pig iron to make various high-quality steels of open-hearth grade; except for alloy steel, they can replace open-hearth furnaces to produce various steel grades, so the promotion surface can be developed to a considerable width.
　　With the correct coordination of slag making, air supply, furnace type, and blowing angle, the metal blowing loss of alkaline side-blown converters can be reduced to a very low level; in terms of equipment and installations, it is completely manufactured in our country now, which not only saves foreign exchange but also shortens construction time.
　　To summarize the above points, alkaline side-blown converters are worth promoting rapidly in terms of economic benefits and production conditions; however, after more than two years of discussion and comparison, due to the inconsistent views of various parties on the furnace type and smelting method, scientific and reasonable comparison data has not yet been obtained, resulting in a pending decision, which affects the promotion of this steelmaking method and is an intangible loss to the country. In view of the tension in the supply of steel materials, and for the important purpose of increasing production and saving, I sincerely hope that the State Planning Commission can consider this disagreement that hinders the promotion of alkaline side-blown, and notify the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry to instruct the Iron and Steel Bureau to organize a special committee to conduct various competitive comparisons through actual trial operation, so as to obtain affirmative data, so that various opinions can be unified, so as to promote the promotion of alkaline side-blown converters and contribute to the increase in steel production and savings.

　　关于转炉炼钢的两点建议
　　余名钰认为应该建立一个标准单位的“全氧顶吹”的转炉炼钢示范工厂，促进碱性侧吹转炉的推广
    在最近十几年中，我是一个从事转炉炼钢的工作者；因此，想使转炉炼钢，能在社会主义工业化的过程中，发挥最大经济效果的愿望，是十分殷切的；请允许我对转炉炼钢谈谈我个人的不成熟意见，希望各位委员和同志们给以指正。
    由于转炉炼钢法的改进，提高了转炉钢的质量之后，国际间对转炉炼的看法，已经改变以往所抱的放弃态度，而认为是一种很有前途的炼钢工具了。在我国工业建设正在开始而废钢十分缺乏的时期里，扩大转炉钢的生产是很有利的；这是我国大多数炼钢者所公认而得到支持的。这种意见虽然得到各种不同的共鸣，但在事实上还是未曾看到，对扩大转炉钢的生产，有任何积极行动。我个人对这种矛盾的看法，以为是各方面对各种转炉的评价不同所造成的。
    在“底吹”、“侧吹”和“顶吹”三种转炉中，支持采用氧和蒸气混合的碱性底吹转炉者最占少数，所以实际上等于存在着“侧吹”和“顶吹”的两种不同主张了。
    主张“顶吹”者认为“全氧顶吹”转炉炼钢是目前最先进方法。为了迅速赶上世界先进水平，应该采用这种炼钢法来扩大生产，就不要多走弯路，再去研究改进其它转炉和炼钢法了。
      “全氧顶吹”碱性转炉炼钢，对生产磷、氮、氢含量特低的钢，确是有优越的特性，而是现在先进的新成就；我们应该迎头赶上，设法在最短期间内建立一个这种炼钢法的示范厂，一面吸收各国已经成就的方法从事生产，一面再在现有的基础上进行研究改进，则几年之后，我国对“全氧顶吹”法炼钢，不独能够赶上世界先进水平，而且还有超越世界先进水平的可能。
    有了这样一个标准单位产量的“全氧顶吹”炼钢示范厂，我们就能彻底分析这种炼钢法的生产成本和应用范围；然后从我国各种钢种的需要量中，得出由这种方法来炼的最经济合理的几种钢种的数量后，才能作出这种炼钢法的推广计划。因此，要采用这种炼钢法来增加产钢量，尽快建立示范工厂是十分必要的。
    根据现有的资料，“全氧顶吹”法是采用含磷相当低的生铁来炼成磷、氮、氢特低的钢。若只有这样的成就，则这种方法的推广面还是不会太宽；因为一面受了低磷生铁供应量的限制，另一方面是一般平炉级建筑钢目前还不需要这样高的规格。因此，对这种炼钢法还有许多研究改进工作可做的。
    “全氧顶吹”法的另一个优点是炉温高，可以加入废钢以减低成本，这在我们缺乏废钢的阶段就不能发挥这个优点；相反的，在吹炼过程中，氧化物从炉烟中带出量非常严重，这样增加金属吹损量，也就影响到钢的成本了。现在虽经积极地设法收集炉烟中的氧化物，经处理后再加入炉中，还是不能认为基本上解决了这个缺点，而待再进一步的研究改进。
    “全氧顶吹”法必须有大型最新式的制氧机，供给成本低廉的氧，否则钢的成本会高到不可想像的。我国现在还不能制造，而国外对这种新型制氧机也还没有大量制造，所以要推广这个方法来增产，不独须付出大量外汇，而且即使允许动用外汇也恐争取不到这么多的制氧机。因此，要推广这个炼钢法，必须在确定其年产量后，着手自制最新型的制氧机。
    总结以上各点，我们应该迅速建立一个标准单位的“顶吹全氧”转炉炼钢的示范工厂，至于全面地推广这种炼钢法的条件，是十分不够的。
    主张“侧吹”者认为我国在最近几年中，由于党和政府的正确领导，对侧吹碱性转炉炼钢有了相当突出的成就；我们应该尽快地利用这种成就来扩大生产，以加速社会主义工业化的进程。
    碱性“侧吹”转炉里可用含磷高低不受限制的各种生铁充原料，炼成合乎国家平炉标准的建筑钢材；也能用含磷低的生铁炼成平炉级的各种优质钢；除了合金钢外，可替代平炉来生产各样钢种，所以推广面能够发展到相当宽。
    碱性侧吹转炉在造渣、供风、炉型和吹炼角的正确配合下，金属吹损量是可以降到很低的；在装置设备方面，完全是我国现在所能制造的，这样不独节省外汇而且缩短了建设时间。
    总结以上各点，碱性侧吹转炉在经济效果上和生产条件上是值得迅速推广的；但经过两年多的讨论比较，终因各方面对炉型和冶炼法的看法不一致，至今还未得科学合理的比较数据，以致悬而未决，影响了这种炼钢法的推广，对国家在无形中是一种损失。鉴于钢料供应的紧张，为了增产节约的重要，我衷心希望国家计划委员会能考虑这个妨碍碱性侧吹推广的不同意见，通知冶金工业部责成钢铁局组织专门委员会，用实际试炼操作，进行各种竞赛式的比较，从而得出肯定性的数据，使各种意见都能得到一致，以促进碱性侧吹转炉的推广，而有助于钢的增产节约。（附图片）
