Plant More Trees and Create More Forests
Commentator of this newspaper

1956 was a year of great development for China's afforestation cause. In this year, all regions, under the slogan of "greening the motherland," widely launched mass afforestation campaigns and achieved great results. Now, the 1957 afforestation season has begun again, and all regions should strive to achieve even greater results in this spring's afforestation campaign than last year's.

Planting trees and creating forests is closely related to both agriculture and industry. For industrial production, it can provide important raw materials. For agriculture, it can preserve soil and water, maintain soil fertility, regulate rainfall, reduce drought and flood disasters, and prevent wind and sand. For the workers engaged in planting trees and creating forests, it can also directly increase income. Therefore, many countries in the world today pay great attention to this undertaking, and for China, the significance is even greater. Chinese farmers have an average of only about three mu of arable land per person, and there is a certain limit to increasing the yield per unit area and expanding the arable land area. This is a major constraint on the development of the rural economy. However, China has vast mountainous areas that account for about 70% of its land area. These mountainous areas are sparsely populated and can be planted with various trees. In the plains, there are also many places where trees can be planted. If all regions can pay attention to the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, the production will develop faster and the people's income will increase faster. Daobakou Village in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, with thirty-five households, used to be a poor mountain village. Since 1944, due to the implementation of the policy of organizing and comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, the village's appearance has undergone fundamental changes. In addition to turning all the cultivated land into terraced fields, greatly increasing the yield, each household now has an average of more than two large livestock, twenty sheep, nearly two pigs, ten chickens, and more than one beehive. The village has 400 mu of mature forest and 160,000 mature trees. The total property of the village is worth more than 360,000 yuan in cash, with an average of more than 10,000 yuan per household. Last year, it suffered severe waterlogging and flooding, which reduced agricultural production by 50%, but the total income of the village still reached 14,600 yuan, of which the income from forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations accounted for 80%. After deducting agricultural tax and all expenses of the agricultural cooperative, the average income per household was 330 yuan. There are many similar examples.

However, in the past, many comrades did not have sufficient understanding of this point. They paid attention to the plains and ignored the mountainous areas; they paid attention to agriculture and ignored forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations. As a result, the production potential of the mountainous areas was not tapped, and the enthusiasm of the farmers for production could not be fully utilized. This was very unfavorable to both the country and the farmers. Some, although they also paid attention to the production in the mountainous areas, only indiscriminately felled forests and lacked due attention to afforestation. They did not understand the principle that those who live off the mountains must take care of the mountains, and those who eat from the mountains must nurture the mountains. They only took from it without giving back, neglecting the long-term construction of the mountainous areas. This would lead to sitting idly by and exhausting the mountains, plunging the vast mountainous areas into poverty and despair.

In order to develop forestry, green the motherland, provide raw materials for industry, and increase farmers' income, the above-mentioned erroneous practices must be corrected. Leading organs in all regions should earnestly carry out production planning for mountainous areas and the overall planning for forestry, earnestly resolve various contradictions in production, so that land can be rationally utilized, suitable for agriculture is used for agriculture, suitable for forestry is used for forestry, and suitable for animal husbandry is used for animal husbandry, so that production potential can be fully utilized.

For this purpose, it is necessary to correctly resolve issues such as the entry of trees into the cooperatives, the organization of forestry labor, and the evaluation of work and calculation of remuneration for forestry labor. At present, the valuation of trees entering the cooperatives is generally too low, and some are even not valued at all. There is a lack of forestry labor organization within the cooperatives, and most of the forestry labor is treated as basic construction work or voluntary labor, without paying labor remuneration. This is not only very unfavorable to forestry construction, but also inconsistent with the principle of distribution according to work. This situation must be changed. The entry of trees into the cooperatives must be handled correctly in accordance with the provisions of the model charter of advanced agricultural production cooperatives. For those that have not yet entered the cooperatives, they should be mobilized to join and reasonably valued according to the labor expended in the past. For those that have already entered the cooperatives but have been valued too low or not valued at all, they should be dealt with separately according to the specific circumstances. At present, forestry production has become an indispensable production task of each agricultural cooperative, so agricultural cooperatives with a large proportion of forestry production should have professional forestry labor organizations to make sure that people are responsible for their tasks, and increase labor efficiency. In the past, in some places, because the problem of unified recording of work points and unified calculation of remuneration for forestry work and agricultural work was not resolved, the survival rate of afforestation was not high, and a lot of labor was wasted. All regions must pay attention to solving this problem.

In order to develop forestry construction, all regions should widely publicize the benefits of planting trees and creating forests to the broad masses, so that forestry construction is included in the production plan of each agricultural cooperative and completed on schedule. After the farmers take action, efforts should be made to strengthen technical guidance. Forestry departments at all levels and forestry work stations in all regions must learn science and technology, sum up the experiences of the masses, vigorously guide the masses, and systematically train forestry workers of agricultural cooperatives.

The masses in many areas of China have experience in afforestation and also have afforestation habits. After cooperativization, the strength of afforestation has become even greater. All regions should educate the masses to implement the policy of self-collection of seeds, self-cultivation of seedlings, and self-afforestation. Only in this way can the afforestation cause be rapidly developed. Relying solely on state assistance will cause the work to stagnate.

State-owned afforestation is the socialist cause of the state. It can not only increase the country's forest resources, but also serve as a demonstration to the masses, driving the mass afforestation movement. Therefore, state-owned forest farms must strive to improve afforestation technology, improve business management, so as to reduce costs and improve the quality and efficiency of work.

    多多植树造林
    本报评论员
    1956年是我国造林事业大发展的一年。在这一年中，各地普遍以绿化祖国为口号，广泛地开展了群众性的造林运动，取得很大的成绩。现在，1957年的造林季节又已开始，各地应该努力争取今春的造林运动能够在去年运动的基础上取得更大的成绩。
    植树造林，对于农业和工业都有很密切的关系。对于工业生产，能够提供重要的原料。对于农业，一能保持水土，保养地力；二能调节雨量，减少旱涝灾害；三可防御风沙。对于植树造林的劳动者来说，还可以直接增加收入。所以今日世界上许多国家都很注意这一事业，对我国来说，意义则更加重大。我国农民每人平均大体只有三亩左右耕地，而提高单位面积产量和扩大耕地面积，又都有一定限度。这在发展农村经济上是一个很大的限制。但我国却有大约占国土面积70％的广大山区。这些山区地广人稀，可以种植各种树木。在平原地区，也有许多地方可以植树。如果各地都能注意农、林、牧业多种经济全面发展，就会使生产有较快的发展，人民收入有较快的增加。山西省昔阳县三十五户人家的刀把口村过去是一个穷困的山庄，1944年以来，由于贯彻执行了组织起来，全面发展农林牧多种经济的方针，现在这个村的面貌发生了根本的变化。他们除把耕地都修成梯田，使产量大大提高以外，现在每户平均有大牲口两头多，羊二十只，猪近两口，鸡十只，蜜蜂一箱多。全村有成材林四百亩，成材树十六万株。把全村的财产折成现金，共有三十六万多元，每户平均有一万多元。去年遭到严重的涝灾和洪灾，使农业减产50％，但全村总收入还达到一万四千六百元，其中林业、畜牧业和副业的收入占80％。除去农业税和农业社的一切开支，每户平均收入三百三十元。类似的事例很多。
    但是，过去许多同志对这点认识不足。他们注意了平川，忽视了山区；注意了农业，忽视了林、牧、副业。因而山区生产潜力没有发掘出来，农民的生产积极性也无法充分发挥。这对国家和农民都是非常不利的。有的虽然也注意了山区生产，但他们只是滥伐森林，对于造林缺乏应有的重视。他们不了解靠山必须吃山，吃山必须养山的道理。只取之，不予之，忽视了长远的山区建设。这样将会坐吃山空，使广大山区陷于山穷水尽。
    为了发展林业，绿化祖国，供工业以原料，并使农民增加收入，上述各种错误的做法必须加以纠正。各地领导机关应该认真进行山区生产规划和整个林业的规划，认真解决生产上的各种矛盾，使土地得到合理的利用，宜农者农，宜林者林，宜牧者牧，使生产潜力充分地发挥起来。
    为了这一目的，必须正确地解决林木入社、林业劳动组织和林业劳动的评工计酬等问题。目前林木入社作价一般偏低，有的甚至不作价。社内缺乏林业劳动组织，林业劳动大部分是按基本建设工或义务工来处理，而不付给工酬。这样不仅对林业建设非常不利，而且也与按劳取酬的原则不符合。这种情况必须改变。林木入社，必须按高级农业生产合作社示范章程的规定来正确处理。尚未入社的，应该动员入社，按过去所费劳动合理作价。已入社而作价偏低或根本未作价的，应根据具体情况分别处理。目前林业生产已经成为各农业社的一项不可缺少的生产任务，因此林业生产比重较大的农业社就应当有专业的林业劳动组织，使事有专责，提高劳动效率。过去有些地方因为林业工和农业工统一记工和统一计酬的问题得不到解决，造林成活率不高，浪费了不少劳动力。各地必须注意解决这个问题。
    为了发展林业建设，各地应当向广大群众广泛宣传植树造林的好处，使林业建设列入每个农业社的生产计划，按期完成。农民行动起来以后，要努力加强技术指导。各级林业部门、各地的林业工作站，必须学习科学技术，总结群众经验，大力来指导群众，有计划地训练农业社的林业员。
    我国许多地区的群众有造林经验，也有造林习惯。合作化以后，造林力量更壮大了。各地应该教育群众，实行自采种、自育苗、自造林的方针。只有如此，才能使造林事业得到迅速的开展。单纯依靠国家帮助，则会使工作停滞不前。
    国营造林是国家的社会主义事业，它既可以增加国家的森林资源，又可以示范于群众，带动群众的造林运动。因此国营林场必须努力提高造林技术，改善经营管理，以降低成本，提高工作的质量和效率。
