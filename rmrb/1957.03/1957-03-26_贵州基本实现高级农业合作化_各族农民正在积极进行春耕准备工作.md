Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 24th—Guizhou Province, mainly characterized by mixed ethnic populations and mountainous areas, has reached more than 17,000 advanced agricultural production cooperatives to date. The number of farm households participating in advanced cooperatives accounts for more than 80% of the total number of farm households, basically achieving advanced agricultural cooperativization. At present, farmers of all ethnic groups are actively carrying out various spring plowing preparations. More than 16,000 small-scale farmland water conservancy projects have been built, which are estimated to expand the irrigation area by more than 1.2 million mu. The accumulated fertilizer has reached about 40% of the planned application of 5,000 jin per mu.

Due to the relatively late completion of land reform in Guizhou Province, the planned development of agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province began at the end of 1953.

Since the vast majority of counties in Guizhou Province are inhabited by farmers of minority ethnic groups, taking into account the characteristics of various ethnic groups in the agricultural cooperativization movement has become a very important issue. Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture had previously conducted investigations and research on ethnic characteristics, and made supplementary regulations for running cooperatives based on the model charter of advanced cooperatives. Full consultations were held with ethnic leaders during the establishment of the cooperatives, and issues such as land, farm tools, livestock, and trees joining the cooperatives were properly resolved. Land used by women to grow indigo (dye), cotton, and vegetables was generally retained to 5% of the local per capita land area, and in some cases even up to 7%. The "Malangpo" for young people's love activities and the old-age cattle needed by the elderly were generally not included in the cooperatives. In this way, national unity was strengthened and the production enthusiasm of farmers of all ethnic groups was stimulated in many ethnic joint cooperatives. At the same time, according to the different conditions of the regions, the scale of the cooperatives was controlled at around 100 to 200 households, adapting to the geographical characteristics of the region and the current level of cadre management.

### 贵州基本实现高级农业合作化　各族农民正在积极进行春耕准备工作

　　贵州基本实现高级农业合作化
　　各族农民正在积极进行春耕准备工作
    据新华社贵阳24日电　以民族杂居和山区为主要特点的贵州省，到目前为止高级农业生产合作社已达到一万七千多个，参加高级社的农户已占总农户的80％以上，基本上实现了高级农业合作化。现在，各族农民正积极进行各项春耕准备工作，兴修的小型农田水利工程共达一万六千多处，估计可扩大灌溉面积一百二十万多亩；积制的肥料，已达每亩计划施放五千斤的40％左右。
    贵州省由于完成土地改革较晚，全省有计划的发展农业生产合作社是从1953年年底开始的。
    贵州省由于绝大多数县内都杂居有少数民族农民，因此在农业合作化运动中照顾各民族的特点，就成为很重要的问题。黔东南苗族侗族自治州曾事先对民族特点进行了调查研究，根据高级社示范章程作了办社补充规定。办社中并和民族领袖人物充分协商，妥善地解决了土地、农具、耕畜、林木等入社问题。妇女用来种蓝靛（染料）、棉花和蔬菜等用地，一般都留到当地每人平均土地数的5％，有的还留到7％，年青人恋爱活动的“马郎坡”，老年人需要的养老牛等，一概不入社。这样在许多民族联合社里既加强了民族团结，也激发了各族农民的生产积极性。同时各地还根据地区的不同情况，把合作社的规模控制在百户左右到二百户，适应这个地区的地理特点和当前的干部管理水平。
