Xinhua News Agency, Rome: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party held a plenary session from February 26 to March 2. The Deputy General Secretary of the Party, Longo, delivered a report at the meeting on the first item on the agenda: "The Tasks of Communists in the Struggle of the Working People." The meeting adopted a resolution on this report.

Longo pointed out that the monopoly organizations' control over the Italian economy hinders the full employment of the working people, the development of small enterprises, and the development of the backward areas in the south. He said that the modernization of production technology will not weaken but rather deepen the inherent contradictions of the capitalist system. The interdependence between monopoly organizations and the state increasingly demonstrates the class nature of the bourgeois state. Therefore, to use state economic organs to carry out anti-monopoly struggles, it is necessary to establish a new government that truly represents the working class.

Longo then discussed the situation of the increasing exploitation of the working people. He pointed out that Italy's industrial output has increased, and capitalists' profits have also risen significantly, but workers' wages have increased very little, and the number of unemployed has hardly decreased. For example, from 1948 to 1955, Italy's industrial output nearly doubled, while the average wage of workers increased by only 19%. In the metallurgical industry, entrepreneurs' profits have increased by 50% in the past three years, while workers' wages have increased by only 8%. This situation can be seen in machinery manufacturing, chemicals, and other major industrial sectors.

Longo emphasized that workers' demands cannot be met without tenacious and sustained struggle. The Communists agree with and support the demands put forward by the Italian General Confederation of Labor: to increase wages; to shorten the work week while maintaining existing wages; and to protect freedom and democratic rights in enterprises.

Longo finally emphasized the significance of achieving unity among the various trade union factions and the tasks of the Communists. He said that the current urgent requirement is for the various trade union factions to act in unity in the struggle for common goals. We should at all times use all means to strive for the unity of action of the working people, to overcome the division of various trade union organizations, and to establish a unified trade union federation.

Many members spoke in the discussion of Longo's report.

Giuseppe Di Vittorio, General Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, pointed out in his speech that the Italian working people are facing the threat of further attacks on their rights by capitalists. He called for a struggle to defend the interests of the working people and to strengthen the unity of the Italian General Confederation of Labor.

In his concluding remarks, Longo pointed out that it is necessary to fight against monopoly capital. The Communist Party should put forward concrete political proposals and support the struggle of industrial workers under the leadership of trade unions to improve working conditions and living standards.

    意共中央全会讨论党在群众斗争中的任务
    号召行动一致争取改善生活
    据新华社讯  据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利共产党中央委员会从2月26日到3月2日举行了全体会议。党的副总书记隆哥在会上就第一项议程——“共产党人在劳动人民群众斗争中的任务”作了报告。会议就这个报告作了决议。
    隆哥指出，垄断组织对意大利经济的控制妨碍了劳动人民的充分就业、小企业的发展以及对南部落后地区的开发。他说，生产技术的现代化，不仅不会削弱反而会加深资本主义制度固有的矛盾。垄断组织和国家之间的相互依赖关系越来越清楚地表明了资产阶级国家的阶级性质。因此，要利用国家经济机关来进行反垄断的斗争，就必须成立一个真正代表劳动阶级的新的政府。
    隆哥接着谈到劳动人民所受的剥削日益加深的情况。他指出，意大利的工业产量增加了，资本家的利润也已经大大上升，但是工人的工资却增加得很少，失业人数几乎没有减少。例如从1948年到1955年，意大利工业产量增加了将近一倍，而工人的平均工资只增加了19％。在冶金工业中，最近三年来企业主的利润增加了50％，而工人的工资只增加了8％。这种情况在机器制造、化学和其他主要工业部门中都可以看到。
    隆哥强调指出：没有顽强而持久的斗争，工人的要求是不可能得到满足的。共产党人赞同和支持意大利总工会所提出的要求：增加工资；在维持原有工资的条件下缩短工作周；保护企业中的自由和民主权利。
    隆哥最后着重指出工会派别之间实现团结的意义和共产党人的任务。他说：当前迫切的要求是各工会派别之间在为共同目标进行的斗争中行动一致。我们无论何时都应当用一切方法争取劳动人民的行动一致，以克服各工会组织的分裂、建立统一的工会联合会。
    在讨论隆哥的报告时，许多委员发了言。
    意大利总工会总书记朱塞佩·维多里奥在发言中指出，意大利劳动人民正面临着资本家对他们的权利发动进一步进攻的威胁。他号召为保卫劳动人民的利益，为加强意大利总工会的团结进行斗争。
    隆哥在总结发言中指出，必须同垄断资本进行斗争。共产党应当提出具体的政治主张，支持产业劳动者在工会领导下所进行的争取改善劳动条件和生活条件的斗争。
