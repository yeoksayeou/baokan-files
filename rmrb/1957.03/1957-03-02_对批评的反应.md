Responses to Criticism
Comrade Shi Zhiping, Deputy Director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Commerce, writes:

    The criticism in the article "This Trend Should Not Be Encouraged" published on page 3 of the People's Daily on October 6, 1956, has been very educational and helpful to me. I made mistakes in handling this issue and need to examine myself. I also need to explain some of the details.

    At my suggestion, and after consultation with the Harbin Municipal Bureau of Commerce, the Harbin Department Store and Qiulin Company held a commodity exhibition in early September. At that time, I wanted to use the commodity exhibition to accurately understand the needs of people with higher purchasing power, so as to accurately organize the supply of goods and prepare for the market supply after the wage reform. The original plan was to proceed in two steps: first, send out a small number of invitation cards to relevant departments as an experiment, and ask everyone for their opinions; then invite more comrades to visit. Later, according to comrades from the Municipal Bureau of Commerce, a reporter from the newspaper raised objections on the second day of the exhibition, and it was not continued.

    Because I subjectively wanted to investigate the needs of people with higher purchasing power, I consciously displayed more high-end goods at the exhibition. Most of the items on display were things that were available in the Harbin market at the time, and only some watches and sweaters were newly purchased.

    The problem with holding this exhibition was that we did not consider it thoroughly beforehand, and some of our practices were inappropriate; there should have been no restrictions on who could visit, or we should have allowed only visits and no sales.

    Regarding the issue of buying watches at the department store wholesale station, the facts are as follows: The Department of Commerce purchased fifty watches on behalf of some responsible comrades. The watch buyers all paid in cash, and the money was collected and kept by the secretarial section of the Department of Commerce. The problem was that the money was not sent to the wholesale station in installments, but was sent to the wholesale station in one lump sum at the end of September. The Department of Commerce is an administrative organ and should not directly handle commodity transactions, let alone keep the funds in the secretarial section for a long time, which affected the turnover of funds. This is our mistake.

### 对批评的反应

专栏：对批评的反应

    对批评的反应 
    黑龙江省商业厅副厅长史治平同志来信：
    1956年10月6日人民日报第三版所载“此风不可长”的批评，对我有很大的教育和帮助。我在处理这个问题上是有毛病的，需要进行检查。对有些情节，也须作一些说明。
   在我的倡议下，并经过与哈尔滨市商业局研究，9月初曾由哈尔滨百货公司和秋林公司举办过一次商品展览会。当时，我想通过商品展览会，确切地了解一下购买力较高的一些人需要商品的情况，以便于准确地组织货源，作好工资改革后的市场供应。原来计划分两步进行：先向有关部门少发一些请柬，作为试验，请大家提出意见；然后再多请一些同志参观。后来据市商业局同志向我讲，展览的第二天，报社记者提出了意见，就没有再继续举办下去了。
    因为在主观上是想调查购买力较高的人的需要，所以展览会上也有意识地多摆了一些高级商品。所摆的东西大部分是当时哈尔滨市场上有的东西，只有一部分手表和毛衣是新采购进来的商品。
    举办这次展览会的毛病在于我们事先考虑不周到，某些作法不当；去参观者不应有限制，或者应当光参观不卖货。
    关于在百货公司批发站买表的问题，事实是这样的：商业厅代一部分负责同志买了五十块表。买表者都付了现款，款皆由商业厅秘书科收存保管。问题是没有分期地送到批发站去，到9月末才将款一次送给了批发站。商业厅本来是一个行政机关，不应该直接办理商品的交易，更不应将款长期积压在秘书科，以致影响了资金的周转，这是我们的错误。
