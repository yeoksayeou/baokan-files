Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, March 1st: Sichuan Province will have one million farmer technicians投入 engaged in spring plowing this year. This million-strong army of farmer technicians is composed of agricultural cooperative members who have been trained over the years, plus those who are being trained this year.

The technical training work, which began in early February this year, is generally carried out at the county level. Each county, in accordance with the local production sequence, conducts short-term specialized training classes in categories such as cultivation techniques, plant protection, soil and fertilizer, seeds, the use of new agricultural tools, and poultry and livestock breeding, to impart technical knowledge, requiring each trainee to master a new technology suitable for promotion in the local area. For example, the soil and fertilizer training class opened in Jiajiang County in mid-February enabled hundreds of trainees to learn the techniques of using various fertilizers in different soils in plains, hills, and mountains.

In order to adapt to the new situation in which the area of double-cropping rice in the province will be expanded from more than four million mu last year to more than eight million mu, each county has also trained a group of farmer technicians who can master the techniques of double-cropping rice variety combinations, cultivating strong seedlings, fertilizing, and controlling pests.

    四川百万农民技术员
    即将投入春耕生产
    据新华社成都1日电  四川省今年将有一百万名农民技术员投入春耕生产。这一百万名农民技术员大军是由历年训练的、加上今年受训的农业社社员组成的。
    今年从2月初开始的技术训练工作，一般是以县为单位进行的。各县依照本地的生产顺序，按栽培技术、植物保护、土壤肥料、种子、新农具使用、家禽家畜饲养等分门别类地举办短期专业训练班来进行技术传授工作，要求每一个学员掌握一种适合在本地推广的新技术。例如夹江县在2月中旬开办的土壤肥料训练班，使数百名学员学会了在平坝、丘陵和山地的不同土壤里，使用各种肥料的技术。
    为了适应全省双季稻面积将由去年的四百多万亩扩大到八百多万亩的新情况，各县还训练了一批能掌握双季稻的品种组合、培育壮秧、施肥治虫等技术的农民技术员。
