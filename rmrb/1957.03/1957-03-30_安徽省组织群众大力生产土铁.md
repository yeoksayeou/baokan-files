Anhui Province Organizes the Masses to Vigorously Produce Native Iron

(Our report) Anhui Province's industrial departments are organizing the masses to produce large quantities of native iron. In the eight counties of the Dabie Mountains, the preliminary plan for this year is to produce 20,000 tons of native iron, more than six times the output of last year.

Many riverbeds in the Dabie Mountains contain abundant iron ore sand. The iron content of the ore sand reaches 50% to 70%, making it convenient to pan and easy to refine. The people in the mountainous areas have a tradition of producing native iron. However, in the past, the production volume of native iron in the Dabie Mountains was not large. This year, in order to supplement the shortage of industrial raw materials, the industrial departments of Anhui Province have decided to vigorously develop native iron production. Last year, only seventy iron-smelting furnaces were put into production in the mountainous area; this year, the goal is to increase that to one hundred and seventy-six furnaces, and one hundred and nineteen furnaces are already in production. In terms of production technology, many advanced experiences have also been promoted. Among them, simply finding ways to increase wind power and increase firepower to accelerate the melting of iron can increase output by 30%. If all the native iron planned to be produced in the Dabie Mountains this year is used for handicraft production in Anhui Province, it can supply 40% to 50% of the demand.

　　安徽省组织群众大力生产土铁
    本报讯  安徽省工业部门正在组织群众大量生产土铁。在大别山区的八个县，今年初步计划生产土铁两万吨，为去年产量的六倍多。
    大别山区的许多河床里都蕴藏有丰富的铁矿砂，矿砂含铁量达50％到70％，淘取方便，容易提炼，山区群众向有生产土铁的习惯。但是，过去大别山区土铁的生产量是不大的。今年，安徽省工业部门为了补助工业原料的不足，决定大力发展土铁生产。去年山区投入生产的炼铁炉只有七十座，今年要发展到一百七十六座，现在已有一百一十九座炉进行生产；在生产技术方面，也推广了许多先进经验，其中只是设法增加风力，加大火力使铁加速熔化，就可以提高产量30％。今年大别山区计划生产的土铁，如全部用于安徽省手工业生产，可供需要量的40％到50％。
