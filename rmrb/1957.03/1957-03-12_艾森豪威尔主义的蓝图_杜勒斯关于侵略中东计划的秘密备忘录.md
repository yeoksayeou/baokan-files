Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 11th. Following the recent revelation of the secret letter from oil tycoon Rockefeller to Eisenhower, "Neues Deutschland" reported on March 10th the contents of a secret memorandum submitted by US Secretary of State Dulles to US President Eisenhower in the second half of December last year regarding the US policy in the Middle and Near East.

"Neues Deutschland" stated that the source of this memorandum is absolutely reliable. Copies were sent to members of the National Security Council and leaders of certain US agencies for study under Eisenhower's instructions. Shortly thereafter, Eisenhower proposed his "Eisenhower Doctrine" plan.

Factors Forming a New Situation in the Near East

In this memorandum, Dulles mentioned that the US policy towards the Middle and Near East must proceed from the following three basic factors:

First, the US allies, Britain and France, have been greatly weakened. The war actions in the Near East vividly demonstrated that the diplomatic positions of Britain and France were untenable, and showed the economic instability and military weakness of these two countries. The war in Egypt has destroyed the prestige of Britain and France in Asia and Africa.

Second, special attention must be paid to the "shocking role" played by the Soviet Union in the Near East events. Dulles said that US Ambassador to France, Dillon, believed that Bulganin's note forced Britain and France to end the war actions, and the Arab countries also held the same view. Dulles said that he "does not think it is possible for the Russians to launch an offensive in this region," but he believes that "the active support given by the Russians to the Arab countries will strengthen the 'anti-colonial struggle' of the Arabs."

The third important factor is the irresistible development of Arab countries striving for self-determination and independence, which leads to the strengthening of Arab nationalism. The scale of this nationalism and its impact on other Asian and African countries are currently unimaginable. Dulles believes that this movement may eventually lead to the formation of a league of Arab countries in the Middle East. Dulles went on to point out that the strengthening of Arab nationalism is related to this: the Arabs regard the British failure in Egypt as the most important factor in their history of anti-colonial struggle. Dulles said, "The main threat to the West" lies here.

Killing Two Birds with One Stone

Dulles said that the influence of the above three factors has formed a completely new situation in the Near East. On the one hand, the failure of Britain and France has created a certain "vacuum" here, and Britain and France are absolutely unable to cope with this situation in this region; on the other hand, Egypt and the Arab countries have begun to understand that they can decide their own affairs, and they are trying to get rid of the guardianship of the West that they hate.

Dulles believes that if events continue to develop in this way, the Arab East will soon undergo a transformation similar to that of India, and Western countries will be forced to adjust their relations with the Arab countries on a completely new basis. He said: Therefore, the situation requires the West to make a decision quickly. If this decision cannot be made today, it may be too late tomorrow.

Dulles believes that this decision must be for the United States to immediately take the necessary measures to fill the "vacuum" formed in the Near East. Since this region concentrates two-thirds of the oil reserves, these measures are even more urgent. Dulles said that a "free European, Asian, and African region is almost entirely economically dependent on the oil of the Near East." He also said, "Therefore, if the United States does not act immediately, it will never be able to fulfill the lofty mission given to it by God to lead the free world."

Based on the various factors he stated, Dulles suggested formulating a new approach to US policy in the Near East. The main task of this policy is to "overcome the strengthening of Arab nationalism" and "fill the vacuum formed in the Near East."

For this purpose, Dulles believes that it is first necessary to create certain legal, political, economic, and military prerequisites to give the United States the power and basis to carry out the above tasks in the Near East.

Dulles analyzed the possibility of the United States joining the Baghdad Pact. He believes that at a certain stage, US participation will not solve the problem but will aggravate the difficulty of solving the problem. Therefore, although the Baghdad Pact must be consolidated, and although US participation in the future is not impossible, it is currently necessary to take another approach to the Near East problem.

Military and Economic Measures

Dulles suggested that, following the so-called Formosa (referring to Taiwan) precedent, Congress should pass a resolution granting the President the power to dispatch US troops to the Near East as he deems necessary "in the event of a threat from international communism."

Dulles also suggested taking other measures: First, establishing an "African Defense Treaty" including Libya, Tunisia, Morocco, and also Algeria in the future, which should be coordinated with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Second, taking such measures to rapidly strengthen the US military position in the Near East: providing military assistance to some Arab countries, expanding plans to establish military bases, and stationing so-called "special purpose" troops that may be equipped with nuclear weapons.

Dulles believes that the main "advantage" of the policy he suggested is that the implementation of such a plan will bring the Near East and North Africa within the scope of the US's "strategic responsibility," so that the United States does not have to consult with traditional British and French partners to implement corresponding measures in this region.

Dulles also believes that special propaganda methods must be adopted, including sending special delegations to Arab countries. The basic viewpoint of this propaganda must be anti-communism.

Dulles believes that no matter how skillfully this propaganda is carried out, it is not enough to make the Arab countries agree to the new approach of US policy. Therefore, he said that all military plans must be accompanied by a larger scale economic assistance plan as much as possible.

In the final part of the memorandum, Dulles also analyzed the possible reactions of other countries to the US approach. He believes that it must be taken into account that the new approach in the Near East will lead to "a deterioration of relations with Russia." He said that the US policy will also encounter a series of rejections from Asian countries.

Dulles speculated that Britain and France, due to the loss of their position in the Near East and Africa and the fear of the strengthening of West Germany's power in Europe, may try to improve relations with Russia. However, he estimated that the British's traditional anti-communist stance and the obligations that Britain and France have undertaken to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are sufficient to prevent the United States from considering this possibility in the short term.

### 艾森豪威尔主义的蓝图——杜勒斯关于侵略中东计划的秘密备忘录

    艾森豪威尔主义的蓝图
    ——杜勒斯关于侵略中东计划的秘密备忘录
    新华社柏林11日电　“新德意志报”继不久以前揭露了石油大王洛克菲勒写给艾森豪威尔的秘密信之后，又在3月10日报道了美国国务卿杜勒斯在去年12月下半月就美国的中近东政策提交美国总统艾森豪威尔的一份秘密备忘录的内容。
    “新德意志报”说，这份备忘录的来源是绝对可靠的。它的副本曾经在艾森豪威尔的指令下送给国家安全委员会委员们和美国某些机构的领导人研究。在不久以后，艾森豪威尔就提出了他的“艾森豪威尔主义”计划。
    形成近东新局势的因素
    杜勒斯在这份备忘录中提到美国对中近东的政策必须从下述三个基本因素出发：
    第一，美国的盟国——英、法两国已经大大削弱了。在近东的战争行动鲜明地表明了英法两国的外交政策地位是不堪一击的，并且表明了这两个国家的经济的不稳和军事上的软弱。在埃及的战争已经摧毁了英、法在亚非两洲的威信。
    第二，必须特别注意苏联在近东事件中所起的“令人震惊的作用”。杜勒斯说，美国驻法大使狄龙认为布尔加宁的照会迫使英法两国结束战争行动，对于这一点，阿拉伯国家也有同样的看法。杜勒斯说，他“不认为俄国人在这一地区有发动进攻的可能”，但是他认为“俄国人给予阿拉伯国家的积极支持将加强阿拉伯人‘反殖民主义的斗争’”。
    第三个重要因素是阿拉伯国家争取自决和独立的不可遏止的发展，这种发展导致阿拉伯民族主义的加强。这种民族主义的规模和对其他亚非国家的影响在目前是不可想像的。杜勒斯认为这种运动最后可能导致中东阿拉伯国家联盟的形成。杜勒斯接着指出，阿拉伯民族主义的加强同这一点有连带关系：阿拉伯人把英国在埃及的失败看作是他们反殖民主义斗争历史中的最重要的因素。杜勒斯说，“对西方的主要威胁”正是在这里。
    一箭双雕
    杜勒斯说，上述三种因素的影响在近东形成了完全崭新的局势。一方面由于英法的失败在这里产生了一定的“真空现象”，而英法绝不可能在这一地区应付这种局势；另一方面埃及和阿拉伯国家开始了解它们能够自己决定它们的事务，它们正在力图摆脱它们所憎恨的西方的监护。
    杜勒斯认为如果事件照这样的方式发展下去，阿拉伯东方很快就会发生类似印度那样的转变，而西方国家就将被迫在完全新的基础上调整他们和阿拉伯国家的关系。他说：因此局势要求西方迅速作出决定。如果这种决定不能在今天作出来，明天或许就太迟了。
    杜勒斯认为这种决定必须是美国立即采取必要的措施以填充在近东所形成的“真空”。由于这一地区集中了石油矿藏的三分之二，所以这些措施更有迫切的必要。杜勒斯说，一个“自由的欧、亚地区和非洲在经济上几乎完全依靠近东的石油”。他又说，“因此如果美国不立即行动的话，它就绝不能履行上帝所赋予它的领导自由世界的崇高使命”。
    杜勒斯根据他所陈述的各种因素，建议制订在近东的美国政策的新方针。这种政策的主要任务就是“克服阿拉伯民族主义的加强”和“填充在近东所形成的真空”。
    为了这种目的，杜勒斯认为首先必须创造一定的法律、政治、经济和军事前提，以赋予美国在近东执行上述任务的权力和基础。
    杜勒斯分析了美国加入巴格达条约的可能性。他认为，在一定的阶段中，美国的参加将不能解决问题而将加重解决问题的困难，因此虽然必须巩固巴格达条约，虽然美国在将来的参加不是不可能的，但是在目前却是要对近东问题采取另外的途径。
    军事经济双管齐下
    杜勒斯建议仿照所谓福摩萨（指台湾）先例，由国会通过决议授予总统以“在受到国际共产主义威胁的情形下”照自己的估计派遣美国军队到近东去的权力。
    杜勒斯还建议采取其他一些措施：第一，建立一个包括利比亚、突尼斯、摩洛哥和将来也包括阿尔及利亚的“非洲防卫条约”，这一条约应该同北大西洋组织协调。
    第二，采取这样的措施以迅速加强美国在近东的军事地位：对一些阿拉伯国家给予军事援助，扩大建立军事基地的计划，驻扎所谓“特种目的”的、可能装备原子武器的部队。
    杜勒斯认为他所建议的政策的主要“优点”在于：在实现这样的计划时将使近东和北非被圈在美国的“战略责任”的范围内，这样可以使美国不要同传统的英法伙伴商讨就在这一地区执行相应的措施。
    杜勒斯还认为，必须采取特别的宣传方法，包括派遣专门代表团到阿拉伯国家去的办法，这种宣传的基本观点必须是反对共产主义。
    杜勒斯认为，无论这种宣传执行得多么巧妙也不足以使阿拉伯国家同意美国政策的新方针。因此他说全部的军事计划必须尽可能伴随较大规模的经济援助计划。
    在备忘录的最后部分，杜勒斯还分析了其他国家对美国方针的可能反应。他认为必须考虑到在近东的新方针将导致“对俄国关系的恶化”。他说美国的政策也将遇到一系列亚洲国家的拒绝。
    杜勒斯推测英法由于在近东和非洲丧失地位和畏惧西德在欧洲的势力的加强，可能会设法同俄国改善关系。但是他估计英国人的传统的反共立场和英法对北大西洋组织所承担的义务，已足够使美国在短期内不必考虑这种可能性。
