Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 21st: The Arab League Political Committee held a meeting in Cairo on the 20th and passed three resolutions expressing support for Egypt's position in the Gaza Strip, the rights of Arabs in their territorial waters of the Gulf of Aqaba, and Egypt's full sovereignty over the Suez Canal.

The committee also discussed the Palestine issue.

The committee is composed of the principal diplomatic envoys of Arab countries stationed in Cairo.

Xinhua News Agency, March 21st: Washington dispatch: US State Department Press Officer White commented on Egypt's memorandum regarding the collection of Suez Canal tolls on the 20th, stating that Egypt's plan was unsatisfactory.

White said that the United States still maintains that the canal issue should be resolved in accordance with the six principles adopted by the United Nations Security Council. The United States hopes to determine its attitude towards Egypt's memorandum after hearing the Secretary-General's report.

Xinhua News Agency, March 21st: London dispatch: A British Foreign Office spokesman said on the 20th, in reference to Egypt's memorandum on Suez Canal tolls and management issues, that Britain insists on the "temporary plan" put forward by Western countries on this issue.

The spokesman also stated that Britain is prepared to negotiate with Egypt on the basis of the six principles adopted by the Security Council.

News from Paris says that Britain and France are discussing a common attitude towards the Egyptian memorandum, and it is said that they will also consult with the United States and Norway. The "temporary plan" was put forward by these four countries.

Xinhua News Agency, March 21st: Cairo dispatch: General Wheeler, the head of the United Nations Suez Canal clearance operation, said on the 20th, "The Egyptians have very good technicians. They possess first-class talent in all aspects of canal management—in machinery, lighting, and engineering management." He is confident that once the Suez Canal is opened, the Egyptians will be able to manage the canal very efficiently.

Wheeler arrived in Cairo on the evening of the 19th from Ismailia. He is here to report to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the progress of the canal clearance.

Wheeler said that according to their estimates, it is expected that the last obstacle will be removed from the canal by April 10th.

Xinhua News Agency, March 21st: Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir left New York for home on the 20th. On the day before leaving New York, she said once again that Israel has the right to free passage through the Suez Canal. She said that once the canal is reopened to all ships, Israel will immediately send its ships through the canal "to see what Egypt does."

She added that Israel expects India to urge Egypt to "cancel its state of belligerency against Israel" and to obtain Egypt's cooperation in agreeing to allow Israeli ships to pass through the Suez Canal and the Straits of Tiran in the Gulf of Aqaba.

    阿拉伯联盟政治委员会通过决议
　　支持埃及对加沙地带和运河的主权
　　美英法继续在运河通行费问题上对埃及施加压力
    新华社开罗21日电　阿拉伯联盟政治委员会20日在开罗举行会议，通过了三项决议，表示支持埃及在加沙地带的地位、阿拉伯人在他们的亚喀巴湾领海的权利和埃及对苏伊士运河的充分的主权。
    委员会还讨论了巴勒斯坦问题。
    委员会是由阿拉伯国家驻在开罗的主要外交使节组成的。
    据新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院新闻发布官怀特20日在评论埃及关于征收苏伊士运河通行费的备忘录时表示，埃及的计划是不能令人满意的。
    怀特说，美国目前仍然主张根据联合国安全理事会通过的六项原则来解决运河问题。美国希望在听取秘书长的报告以后再确定它对埃及备忘录的态度。
    据新华社21日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交部发言人20日在谈到埃及关于苏伊士运河通行费和管理问题的备忘录时说，英国坚持西方国家就这个问题提出的“临时计划”。
    发言人还表示，英国准备在安全理事会通过的六项原则基础上同埃及进行谈判。
    从巴黎传出的消息说，英国和法国正在商量对埃及备忘录确定一个共同态度，据说它们还要同美国和挪威商量。“临时计划”就是这四个国家提出来的。
    据新华社21日讯　开罗消息：联合国苏伊士运河清理工作负责人惠勒将军20日说，“埃及人有非常好的技术人员。他们在运河管理工作的各方面——在机械、照明和工程管理等方面——都拥有第一流的人材”。他确信一旦苏伊士运河开放以后，埃及人将能很有效率地管理这条运河。
    惠勒在19日晚上从伊士美利亚到达开罗。他是来向联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德报告运河清理情况的。
    惠勒说，根据他们的估计，预料到4月10日将能把最后一个障碍从运河中清除出去。
    据新华社21日讯　以色列外交部长梅厄夫人20日离纽约返国。在离纽约前一日，她再一次说，以色列有权自由通过苏伊士运河。她说，一旦运河对所有船只重新开放，以色列将马上派遣它的船只通过运河，“看看埃及怎么办”。
    她又说，以色列期望印度促使埃及“取消对以色列的交战状态”，并且取得埃及的合作，使它同意让以色列船只通过苏伊士运河和亚喀巴湾中的蒂朗海峡。
