　　Nigeria
　　Nigeria is located in West Africa, bordered by French African territories on the east, west, and north. It covers an area of 370,000 square miles and has a population of 31 million. It is the largest British colony in West Africa.
    Nigeria was discovered by the Portuguese in the 15th century. In 1861, it was occupied by British troops. In 1914, it became a British colony and protectorate. In 1954, it officially became a federation under the rule of the British Governor-General.
    Nigeria is rich in mineral resources, including tin, lead, iron, gold, and other minerals. In recent years, abundant uranium deposits have been discovered, making it one of the world's largest uranium mines. Its main exports are cocoa, tin ore, and peanuts. Nigeria is not only a vast source of super-profits for imperialist plunder, but also a strategically important hub in the war plans of the US-British bloc. Its entire economy is manipulated by foreign monopoly capital.
    Like other parts of Africa, the Nigerian people have been constantly resisting under the long-term and brutal oppression of imperialism. Actions such as the nationwide strike of over 30,000 workers against the colonial authorities in 1945 and the strikes by workers in 1952 and 1953 demanding wage increases have demonstrated the strong will of the Nigerian people to break free from the shackles of colonialism.

　　尼日利亚
　　尼日利亚位于非洲西部，东、西、北三面与法国非洲属地接壤，面积三十七万平方英里，人口三千一百万，是英国在西非最大的殖民地。
    尼日利亚在十五世纪为葡萄牙人所发现，1861年被英军占领，1914年成为英国的殖民地和保护国，1954年正式成为英国总督统治下的联邦。
    尼日利亚矿藏丰富，有锡、铅、铁、金等矿产。近年来又发现了丰富的铀矿，为世界最大铀矿之一。它主要的出口是可可、锡矿砂、花生等。尼日利亚不但是帝国主义掠夺超额利润的庞大源泉，而且也是美英集团战争计划中的一个战略上的重要枢纽。它的整个经济受着外国垄断资本的操纵。
    像非洲其他地方一样，尼日利亚人民在帝国主义长期残酷的压榨下，不断进行反抗斗争，如1945年三万多工人反对殖民当局的全国性大罢工以及1952及1953年工人要求增加工资的罢工等行动，都表现了尼日利亚人民要求摆脱殖民主义枷锁的强烈意志。    （王）
