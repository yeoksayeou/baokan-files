　　A Small Factory Struggling Hard
　　Sī Yuán
    In a remote alley in Nantong City, Jiangsu Province, there is an inconspicuous small factory. Walking through the gate, you will see a narrow courtyard, facing a small office that can only accommodate four desks; to the left of the office, a row of bungalows and a three-room Chinese-style building behind it are the workshops. The whole factory seems very cramped. However, after visiting this factory, I was left with a very deep impression.
    In early 1953, the Nantong Civil Affairs Bureau, in order to help some families of revolutionary martyrs and needy households in society solve their living and work problems, prepared several production workshops. One of the sock knitting workshops was the predecessor of today's Qunli Knitting Factory. At that time, the government only invested 8,000 yuan in this workshop. Most of the thirty or so female workers were housewives who had no technical knowledge. Under such conditions, running a factory was undoubtedly very difficult. However, in order to thank the government for opening up a path for them, they were determined to work hard. Without factory buildings, everyone set up the machines in a dilapidated temple. Without benches, everyone brought benches from home. At that time, due to the workers' unfamiliarity with technology, the product quality was low, and the output was small. In the first year of operation, they lost more than 1,000 yuan. Some workers' wages were not even enough to cover their food expenses. It was not until the second year that the production situation improved.
    In the beginning, there were only three management personnel in the factory. Later, as the business developed, it increased to five. Although there were few people, because everyone achieved clear division of labor, contracted responsibilities, went deep into the workshops, and became one with the workers, the factory was managed very well. Their actual work involved juggling several roles. The factory director was the leader who oversaw the overall production plan, and in addition to internal and external affairs, he also managed personnel work; the accountant was in charge of finance, costs, and material supply; the planning statistician was responsible for workshop production records, product color matching plans, and labor wages in addition to preparing plans; the storekeeper was responsible for the receipt and dispatch of raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished products, both internal and external; as for the clerk, needless to say, he was simply the "Minister of Irresponsibility" and also served as the commissary officer in charge of food. Because of the many concurrent positions, everyone was very busy. If they couldn't finish their work during the day, they would work overtime at night.
    When the workload was uneven, the comrades who were less busy would take the initiative to help the comrades who were busy. For example, Feng Yinqing, the nineteen-year-old planning statistician (who recently left the factory to join the army), was promoted from among the workers. He was proficient in all six procedures of the factory and could even repair machines, so he often went to help in the processes that were short of manpower when he had some spare time. Although Su Yuqing was an accountant, he often did odd jobs such as sweeping the floor and emptying the spittoons in the office, because the Qunli Factory had never had a janitor in its four years of operation since its establishment. Liu Xinglong, the workshop director, was also a person who held several positions and did not separate himself from production. His position was workshop director and technician. In the past, whenever the factory's machines needed parts or modifications, they had to be sent to the machine factory for repair, which was expensive and time-consuming. Liu Xinglong thought it was not cost-effective, so he suggested that the administration add tools and do the repair and modification themselves, which could save forty or fifty yuan in repair costs every month. So he also took on the role of machine repairman.
    Under the influence of the thrifty spirit, the workers also had a relatively strong sense of increasing production and practicing economy. Many sock factories left a circle of shuttle threads on the cuffs after the sock tubes were knitted, which were discarded after being drawn out when sewing the sock toes. The workers of the Qunli Factory added a part to the machine to accumulate this circle of shuttle threads and use it on the inner layer of the sock tubes. In this way, they could save twenty bundles of thread a year, worth seven hundred yuan. They also had new improvements in the process of drying and ironing. The bottom of the sock drying stove was originally flat. They improved it by changing the bottom to a sloping upward, so that the heat was concentrated in the upper layer. The socks were easily dried well, and coal was saved. There are many similar examples.
    The cadres and workers of the Qunli Knitting Factory cherished every bit of manpower, material resources, and financial resources in this diligent and thrifty manner, so that the factory slowly developed. Although the appearance of the factory has not changed much in the past four years, the number of employees has increased from the initial 30 to 88, the number of knitting machines has increased from 20 to 57, and the output of socks has increased from the initial annual output of more than 1,900 dozen to an annual output of more than 17,000 dozen. The estimated task for 1957 is 24,000 dozen. The factory's profit was 1,000 yuan in 1954, and it increased to 5,000 yuan in 1956; it has turned over nearly 10,000 yuan to the state in the past few years. In order to meet the needs of the expanded market in 1957, they are planning to modify some electric machines to improve production efficiency and increase output. However, they still adhere to the principle of thrift for non-production expenditures.
    As I left this small factory amidst the sound of the knitting machines, I was deeply moved by their spirit of diligence and simplicity. I thought: If all factories could be like this factory, how much wealth could they create for the country!

### 一个艰苦奋斗的小工厂

　　一个艰苦奋斗的小工厂
　　思原
    在江苏省南通市一条偏僻的小巷里有一座不怎惹人注目的小厂。走进大门，就会看到一个狭长的院落，迎面是一个只能容纳四张办公桌的小小的办公室；办公室左侧一排平房和后面一座三间中式楼房就是车间。整个工厂看来是很侷促的。但是，当我访问了这个厂以后，却给我留下了非常深刻的印象。
    1953年初，南通市民政局为了帮助一些生活有困难的烈军属和社会上的困难户解决生活和工作问题，筹备了几个生产工场，其中一个织袜工场就是今天群力针织厂的前身。当时政府对这个工场只投资八千元，三十来个女工大部分是家庭妇女，根本不懂技术。在这样的条件下办厂，毫无疑问，困难是很多的。但是，他们为了感谢政府为他们开辟了道路，决心艰苦奋斗地干下去。没有厂房，大家就在一座破庙里把机器安下来，没有凳子，大家就从家里带凳子来，当时，由于工人技术生疏，产品质量低，产量少，创办第一年就亏蚀了一千多元，有些工人所得工资连伙食费都不够付。直到第二年，生产情况才有好转。
    开始，工厂管理人员只有三个人，后来，业务有了发展，增加到五个人。人虽少，可是由于大家做到了明确分工、包干负责、深入车间、打成一片，却把工厂管理得很好。他们的实际工作都是一身兼数职。厂长是总揽全厂掌握生产计划的领导人，内外事务以外还兼管人事工作；会计管的是财务、成本和物资供应；计划统计员除了编制计划，还负责车间生产纪录、产品配色计划和劳动工资工作；保管员不仅保管物资，从内到外的原料、半制品和制成品的收付都要负责；至于事务员不用说，简直就是“不管部”大臣兼任着伙食上的事务长。由于兼职多，每个人都是很忙的，白天工作做不完，就晚上加班做。
    在工作忙闲不均的时候，闲一些的同志就主动去帮助工作忙的同志，像十九岁的计划统计员冯印庆（最近已离厂服兵役），是从工人中提拔起来的，全厂六道工序连修理机器他都能来一手，所以他工作稍有闲暇，常常钻到缺人手的工序上去帮忙。苏毓麟虽是会计，可是办公室的清洁卫生如扫地、倒痰盂等杂务，常常是他做的，因为群力厂从创办至今四年来，从来没有一个勤杂人员。车间主任刘兴隆也是个身兼数职而且还不脱离生产的人员，他的职务是车间主任兼技术员。以前厂里的机器，凡是配零件，改装都要送机器厂去修理，费用大，时间长，刘兴隆瞧瞧不合算，建议行政上添办了工具，自己搞修配，每月可以节约修理费四、五十元，于是他又兼任了修机匠。
    在勤俭风气的影响下，工人中间增产节约的观念也比较强。许多袜厂在袜筒织成以后，口子上留下了一圈杼线，在缝接袜头时都抽去丢弃的，群力厂的工人们却在机器上加装了一个零件，在缝接时把这圈杼线积累起来用到织袜统的里层上去，这样，一年可以节省二十包线，价值七百元。在烘烫这道工序上，他们也有新的改进。烘袜炉子的底，原先是平的，他们改进了一下，把那底改成为向上斜升的，使热气集中到上层去，袜既容易烘好，又节省了煤。类似这样的事例是很多的。
    群力针织厂的干部和工人，就这样克勤克俭地珍惜一点一滴的人力物力和财力，使工厂慢慢地发展起来。四年来尽管工厂的外貌没有什么改变，可是职工人数已由当初三十人增加到八十八人，织机由二十台增加到五十七台，袜子产量由当初年产一千九百多打发展到年产一万七千多打，1957年的预计任务是两万四千打。工厂的利润1954年是一千元，1956年就增加到五千元了；几年来已经上缴了近万元。为了适应1957年更加扩大了的市场需要，他们正在计划改装一部分电动机器，提高生产效率，增加产量。可是，对非生产开支，他们却仍坚持了节约的原则。
    当我在???的织机声中离开这家小小工厂的时候，我深深地被他们那种勤俭朴实的精神所感动。我想：如果所有的工厂能够像这个厂一样，那末，该能为国家创造多少财富啊！
