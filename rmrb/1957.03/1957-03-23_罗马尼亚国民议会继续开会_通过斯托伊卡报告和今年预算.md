　　罗马尼亚国民议会继续开会
　　通过斯托伊卡报告和今年预算
    据新华社布加勒斯特22日电　罗马尼亚国民议会会议在20日和21日分别通过了部长会议主席斯托伊卡所作的关于国内政策和外交政策的报告和财政部长维若利提出的1957年国家预算。
    在20日的会议上，议员们就斯托伊卡的报告展开了讨论。在讨论中发言的二十三位议员一致表示拥护政府的国内政策和外交政策。他们在发言中指出了近年来罗马尼亚在经济、文化、人民生活等各方面所获得的成就，流露出他们对于工人党和政府的爱戴。有些人也批评了政府工作中存在的缺点。会议除通过斯托伊卡的报告外，还批准了政府在上届国民议会和本届国民议会之间的时期内的活动。
    在21日上午会议上，财政部长维若利作了关于1957年国家预算的报告。他说，政府提交国民议会讨论的1957年国家预算是在现实地估计国民经济资源和条件的基础上制定的，它保证拨款来进一步发展社会主义工农业和更迅速地提高人民生活水平。1957年国家预算规定收入为四百六十一亿四千七百万列伊，支出为四百五十二亿四千七百万列伊。预算全部收入中有91％来自国民经济社会主义部分。预算支出中有52.9％用于国民经济建设，8.1％用于国防。预算规定在发展农业和林业方面支出四十亿列伊，即为1951年的二倍。社会文化措施的开支预计为一百零五亿列伊，即比1956年多二十五亿列伊。
    维若利说，各个企业都应当充分利用设备潜力，减少废品。在生产和行政部门都应当厉行节约，生产的东西应当又多、又好、又便宜。他还谈到应当扩大企业部门的职权，发挥劳动群众的主动精神，消除权力过度集中的现象。
    这天晚间，议员们经过讨论以后批准了今年的预算。
