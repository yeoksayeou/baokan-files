　　Panzhihua is a large iron mine in China.
　　It can provide ore raw materials for large steel plants for more than one hundred years.
　  Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, March 30th. After more than two years of exploration, the Panzhihua Iron Mine in Sichuan Province has been confirmed as one of China's large iron mines. The proven reserves in this mining area are approximately 500 million tons, with an average ore grade of over 40%.
    The main mining area of this iron mine is fifteen kilometers long, and the thickest ore layer is more than one hundred meters. Most of it can be mined in the open air. The Panzhihua Team of the Sichuan Provincial Geological Bureau began exploration in 1955 using methods such as trench exploration, drilling exploration, and tunnel exploration. In 1956, the state announced that the preliminary exploration reserves were 280 million tons.
    The head of the Panzhihua Team told our reporter that the discovery of this mining area provides a guarantee for the establishment of a steel base in the Southwest. If the technical processing problems are solved, it can provide ore raw materials for large steel plants with an annual smelting capacity of 1.5 million tons of iron for more than one hundred years. He said that until now, due to unclear resources, no large steel plant has been established in the Southwest, and most of the steel needed for various construction projects in the Southwest relies on supplies from the Northeast and Central China.
    At present, the exploration work in the main mining area of this region is still in progress.

    攀枝花是我国的一个大铁矿
　　它可以为大型钢铁厂提供一百年以上的矿石原料
　  新华社成都30日电  经过两年多的勘探，四川省攀枝花铁矿已经肯定为我国的大铁矿之一。这个矿区已经被探明的储量约有五亿吨左右，矿石平均品位在40％以上。
    这个铁矿的主矿区长十五公里，矿层最厚的有一百多公尺，大部分可以露天开采。四川省地质局攀枝花队从1955年开始以槽探、钻探、洞探等方式探勘。1956年，国家曾宣布初步勘探储量为二亿八千万吨。
    攀枝花队负责人对本社记者说，这个矿区的探明，为西南建立钢铁基地提供了保证。假若技术加工问题解决，它可以为每年冶炼一百五十万吨铁的大型钢铁厂提供一百年以上的矿石原料。他说，到现在为止，由于资源不清，西南还没有建立起一座大型钢铁厂，西南各项建设所需钢铁大部仰赖东北和华中供应。
    目前，这个地区的主矿区勘探工作仍在继续进行中。
