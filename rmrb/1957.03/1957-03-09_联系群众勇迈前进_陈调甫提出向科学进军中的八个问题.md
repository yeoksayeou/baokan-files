    Contact the Masses, Advance Courageously
    Chen Diaofu Proposes Eight Questions in the March Towards Science
    Our great motherland will transform from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country through several five-year plans, to improve the people's cultural and material living standards. Our wise and great Chairman Mao issued the call to march towards science, and demanded that by 1967, we should approach international levels in important scientific fields. This call deeply moved the hearts of our scientific workers. Please allow me to discuss several issues in the march towards science.
    Using "march" to describe scientific research is very accurate. Firstly, "march" indicates the arduous nature of scientific research. We must learn from the People's Liberation Army's spirit of not fearing difficulties and setbacks, and its optimistic spirit of marching forward valiantly. Secondly, we must learn from the PLA's working style of closely contacting the masses. Our scientific workers are definitely not working alone; we must have a mass viewpoint and rely on the masses to achieve results in a short period. Currently, we are not doing enough in terms of publicizing the important significance of the march towards science to the masses, and learning from the masses to gain their support.
    Scientific workers are now marching on three fronts, which can also be called the "three armies" of the scientific community. They are: (1) the basic science army—composed of comrades engaged in research work in the Academy of Sciences and various research institutions; (2) the teaching army—composed of comrades engaged in teaching work in universities and specialized schools; (3) the production army—composed of comrades engaged in production in factories and mines. Although the total number of people is still insufficient, these three armies are powerful and their morale is very high. In order to achieve brilliant victories, we must remove certain obstacles in the march. Based on my personal observations, I would like to raise the following points for your consideration:
      (1) The issue of collaboration between the three armies—It has been less than a year since the call to march towards science was issued, and the preparatory work in various areas has not been fully completed. Some practices of working independently are still retained. For example, in terms of exchanging information, helping each other, and learning from each other between the three armies, a good system has not yet been established. The production sector is the applied science that combines with practical application and is the vanguard in the march towards science, but some comrades in the research and teaching sectors are not very familiar with production. In fact, the production sector is an expanded laboratory, which contains a lot of perceptual knowledge that can enrich theory. On the other hand, the comrades working in the production sector are often busy completing production tasks and lack time for research in basic science. Especially in small and medium-sized enterprises, temporary measures are often taken to cope with problems. Although this indeed solves certain problems in production, there is no systematic research, organization, and summarization to theoretically improve and consolidate them before moving on to new tasks. If theory and practice can collaborate well, it will definitely enable our scientific level to improve rapidly.
      (2) The issue of division of labor among scientific workers—The superiority of socialism lies in planned division of labor; however, some research departments are still doing some repetitive work, wasting manpower and resources. For example, the work of hydrolyzing fiber with acid to saccharify it and then making alcohol is being done by a certain research institute in Shanghai and the Tianjin Grease Chemical Company. It is said that the Ministry of Forestry is also studying it. There are many similar examples. If there can be close coordination and division of labor, you can do one problem and I can do another, exchange opinions and information with each other, and borrow instruments and materials from each other; or under a general topic, you can do one section and I can do another, and finally summarize to reach a conclusion. This can fully exert our strength in the case of lacking manpower and material resources, which is the most important thing at present. There are three water conservancy research institutes in Beijing, and experts say that the content is roughly the same. Whether this kind of repetitive work is appropriate is worthy of in-depth study.
      (3) Interest must also be appropriately taken care of in the division of labor—There should be military-like discipline in the march, and it is no problem to obey the division of labor assigned by the organization; however, consideration should also be given to appropriately taking care of everyone's interests when assigning tasks. Because where there is interest, the study will be deep, and one will definitely be able to display one's strengths, which is to make the most economical and reasonable use of our very scarce manpower. The best way to take care of this is not to restrict too strictly or rigidly when assigning tasks, but to only specify a larger research scope, within which one can develop freely. Especially for some advanced basic scientific research, the results of which may not be used at present, but will have a great impact in the near future, it is extremely valuable for us to look further ahead. Moreover, the time for scientific research work cannot be required too tightly, with deadlines for completion. Because many research results are occasionally understood after long and arduous study. There are even situations where "intentionally planting flowers will not bloom, but unintentionally inserting willows will create shade." For example, penicillin was accidentally discovered that bacteria were affected by enzymes and could not reproduce, so the research continued and became a great contribution to medicine. If, at that time, because there was no plan, material and time support were not given to continue the research, it may be put aside, and this important discovery would be delayed for many years before it could bring happiness to mankind.
    (4) The issue of the time of scientific workers—Although the arrangement of time for scientific workers has been greatly improved, and they can generally guarantee to spend five-sixths of their time on scientific work according to Premier Zhou's instructions, some people are still busy with administrative affairs and attending unnecessary meetings. This situation seems to be more serious in the production sector and should be avoided. I further hope that the state will cherish the energy of scientific workers and it is best not to give them titles such as "so-and-so director" and let them lead administrative work or lead certain social activities. Because I realize that the purpose of scientific workers participating in social activities for one-sixth of their time is to prevent them from being out of touch with social reality, and it does not seem necessary to let them take on leadership positions. It is better to let them concentrate on leading a small group of people to march into the scientific field, and the results will be greater. Here, I would like to mention in passing that some scientists have too few assistants or students. If they can be given a few more people to lead and train, it can save some of the current minor work time of scientists and cultivate more new forces, which will also be beneficial in the future.
    (5) The issue of books and materials—It is very necessary for scientific workers to read books and magazines and digest the achievements of their predecessors, which can avoid detours. This is like the grain and fodder in the army, an extremely important logistics work. However, there are still some shortcomings in the work of books and materials. I would like to raise them here for the reference of libraries in various provinces and cities: (1) Do not buy too many books, but select them carefully before buying—New libraries often buy all books in order to increase the number of books, which is not smart. You should first consult experts or refer to new book recommendations in magazines to understand the content of the book, whether it is of great use to the readers of the library, whether the neighboring library has already collected it and can be borrowed, and other conditions, and then decide whether to buy it or not. Especially in capitalist countries, booksellers compete to publish new books in order to make profits, but the content is similar. You only need to buy one or two of the best. (2) Do not only buy new books, but also take into account old magazines and special publications—Scientific workers certainly need new books, but also need old magazines for reference. Especially since our country's production is backward, some old materials from foreign countries many years ago are very helpful to our current actual production situation. However, some old magazines and special publications are already out of print. The only way to remedy this is to use photocopies (printed on film or paper), which are cheap, small in size, and easy to store. Libraries should be equipped with magnifying readers, and some libraries should also have equipment for photographing books and periodicals to facilitate readers. (3) Old libraries should assist new libraries—A library with a considerable scale requires long-term cultivation and cannot be achieved overnight. Some tendencies to seek quick success are inappropriate and should be corrected. With the development of new industrial cities in the inland, it is also urgent to establish new libraries. Therefore, it is recommended that old libraries try their best to sort out duplicate books to support new libraries. In this way, old libraries can also free up extra space for storing books. It is said that some large libraries have a lot of unopened books due to lack of space, resulting in mold and moths, which is a great pity.
    (6) The issue of the Scientific and Technological Association and specialized societies—The Scientific and Technological Association and its affiliated specialized societies are bridges connecting the three armies. With the efforts of the leaders of various societies, they can actively play the role of members and are an indispensable part of the march towards science. For example, a factory in Tianjin produced DC generators, and 98% of the products were unqualified due to excessive sparks during rectification. The Electrical Engineering Society organized experts to go deep into the site, and after two days of research and investigation, they put forward improvement measures, which finally enabled more than 90% of the products to meet the design requirements. The Tianjin Chemical Society assisted the Lizhong Sulfuric Acid Plant to improve its equipment, reducing the consumption of nitric acid by two-thirds. There are many other examples. However, the specialized societies in some places have not been able to carry out diverse technical activities, give play to the potential of their members, or have not played a very big role. In the future, the leadership in this area should be strengthened; at the same time, the operating funds of the Scientific and Technological Association and various specialized societies are too small, which is also a practical difficulty, and it is hoped that it can be increased.
    (7) The issue of overall leadership in the march towards science—There should be a general commander in the three armies, and the only one who can take on the great task of commander is the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Some people think that each research, production, and teaching department has its own leadership, and whether adding a general leadership will lead to double leadership and create malpractices. I believe that if the Chinese Academy of Sciences assumes the responsibility of general leadership, its job should be to contact all parties and grasp the balance of overall development, just like a clearing house in the banking industry. The specific work may include the following: (1) Reviewing research topics—The research topics of each research unit are centrally approved by the Academy of Sciences. The Academy of Sciences can specify whether they should be carried out independently or in cooperation with a certain unit. If a certain unit has already researched and solved it, it is not necessary to repeat it. This is the best way to prevent waste. (2) Collecting books and materials on behalf of them—Each unit can attach a list of reference materials when submitting research topics, and the Academy of Sciences can review and supplement them; moreover, the Academy of Sciences has the richest collection of books and also has connections with foreign libraries. If necessary, it can be sent to foreign countries through the Academy of Sciences for reading or photocopying, so that workers can fully grasp the information before starting. (3) Assisting in the purchase of instruments and equipment—For some instruments that must be purchased from foreign countries but have a low utilization rate, the Academy of Sciences can introduce several units to jointly purchase and share them to save foreign exchange. Some experimental drugs are not large in quantity and are easily overlooked by the trade department. The Academy of Sciences can concentrate the needs of various departments and inform the trade department to purchase them, which can be given more attention and also save manpower (Tianjin Nankai University once ordered some fine chemical reagents, but the trade department did not purchase them because the quantity was too small).
      (8) Ideological issues—Scientific workers must be dialectical materialists, so they must study Marxism-Leninism and constantly improve their ideological level, thoroughly understand the superiority of socialism and the necessity of marching towards science, in order to muster the courage to complete the task. There are several ideological situations that deserve attention at present: (1) We must follow the call to build the country with diligence and thrift, and learn from the spirit of hard work and selfless labor of our predecessors Franklin and the Curies. Some people attach too much importance to material conditions, deviate from the current possibilities of our country, and demand good equipment and books, otherwise they think that they cannot exert their abilities. This idea is inappropriate. (2) Under the current material conditions, we must develop the ability to operate independently by doing things ourselves. For example, chemists should learn to blow glass, and mechanics should be able to assemble parts themselves. Some laboratories often complain that there are no small factories to repair instruments when they are broken, which is not as convenient as in foreign countries. Under the current circumstances, some difficulties must be overcome by scientists themselves. (3) There are also some people who demand to participate in key assault work and participate in great engineering departments, otherwise they think that their work has not much to do with the march towards science, and the contribution is not great, and even a sense of inferiority arises. In fact, the scope of scientific work is very broad, and making efforts in various positions is participating in the march towards science. For example, aircraft manufacturing is indeed very important, but if there is no good paint, it will greatly affect the flying speed and the life of the aircraft, so paint is also a very important industry. It has the same importance as the aircraft industry.
    Finally, I heard that scientific research funding has not decreased in this year's campaign to increase production and practice economy, and the foreign exchange for purchasing books has also increased. Director Guo said that the Academy of Sciences will build six large buildings this year, which is a wise measure. As one of the scientific workers, I am extremely excited. In fact, only the development of science is the greatest increase in production and practice of economy. For example, the average content of sodium chloride in the salt in the Changlu area is 88%-89%, and the lowest is only 82%-83%. After the Jiuda Yongli Factory researched it, they knew that by adding calcium chloride in the waste liquid of the factory's steaming ammonia tower to the brine, the content of sodium chloride in the salt can be increased to 90%-93%. According to rough estimates, if the quality of salt is increased by 1%, the Yongli Alkali Plant can save about 100,000 yuan per year. Therefore, we know that the campaign to increase production and practice economy is inseparable from the call to march towards science, and the country is making a big plan in this campaign to increase production and practice economy. Our scientific workers should work hard to march towards science to repay the country's expectations for us. I firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party, the government, and Chairman Mao, the intellectuals in our scientific community will definitely be able to accept the advanced technology of the world and inherit the rich heritage of our ancestors with the same selfless labor and hard work as the workers and peasants, and build our motherland into a prosperous and happy country with a high level of culture.

    联系群众勇迈前进
    陈调甫提出向科学进军中的八个问题
    我们伟大的祖国将通过几个五年计划把落后的农业国变成为先进的工业国，以提高人民的文化和物质生活水平。英明伟大的毛主席提出向科学进军的号召，并要求到1967年在重要的科学部门能接近国际水平。这一号召深深地激动了我们科学工作者的心弦，请允许我在此谈谈向科学进军中的几个问题。
    用“进军”来比拟研究科学是非常确切的。第一是以进军来表示研究科学工作的艰巨性，我们要学习解放军的不怕困难挫折，雄纠纠气昂昂的乐观精神，勇迈前进。其次要学习解放军密切联系群众的工作作风，我们科学工作者决不是单干，必须具有群众观点，依靠群众，才能在短期内取得成绩。目前我们向群众宣传科学进军的重要意义，与向群众学习，取得群众的支持，这方面的工作是做得不够的。
    现在科学工作者正在三个战场上进军，也可称谓科学界的三军。就是（1）基本科学军——以在科学院及各研究机构中从事研究工作的同志组成之；（2）教学军——以在高等院校、专科学校从事教学工作的同志组成之；（3）生产军——以在厂矿从事生产的同志组成之。虽然总的人数还嫌不够，然而这三军声势浩荡，士气非常旺盛。为了取得辉煌的胜利，必须扫除进军中的某些障碍，就我个人观察所得，提出下列几点，请各位指正：
      （一）三军的协作问题——向科学进军的号召提出还不到一年，各方面的准备工作还没有完全做好，仍保留一些各自为政的做法。如三军之间互通声气、互相帮助，互相学习方面，就还没有很好的建立起来。生产部门本是结合实际的应用科学，是科学进军中的先锋队，而研究与教学部门的同志中，有一部分人对生产是不很熟悉的，实际上生产部门是一个扩大的试验室，其中有许多感性知识，可以充实到理论上去的。另一方面，生产部门的工作同志往往忙于完成生产任务，对于基本科学方面缺乏研究时间；尤其是中小型的企业，往往采取一些临时应付办法，虽确实解决了生产上的某些问题，但没有系统地研究整理做好总结，从理论上提高与巩固下来，就又去搞新的任务了。如果理论与实践这两方面能够协作得很好，确能使我们科学水平迅速提高。
      （二）科学工作者之间的分工问题——社会主义的优越性就在一切都有计划地分工；而现在各研究部门之间仍在做了一些重复工作，浪费了人力物力。例如用酸水解纤维使它糖化后制成酒精的工作，上海某研究所与天津油脂化学公司都在做，听说林业部也在研究。诸如此类的例子还很多。如能密切地配合与分工，可以你做一题我做一题，彼此交换意见与资料，互借仪器与资料；也可以在一个总题目之下，你做一段我做一段，最后汇总得出结论。这样能使我们在缺乏人力物力的情况下，充分发挥力量，实在是当前最重要的事。北京有三个水利研究所，据专家说，内容大致一样，这种重复工作是否恰当，值得深刻研究的。
      （三）在分工中还要适当地照顾兴趣问题——进军中应当有军队般的纪律，服从组织分配的分工，这是没有问题的；但分配时也要考虑到适当地照顾各人兴趣。因为兴趣所在，钻研自深，也就必能施展其所长，也就是人尽其才，最经济合理地使用我们很缺乏的人力。照顾的办法最好是分配任务时不要限制过严过死，只指定较大的研究范围，在此范围内可以自由发展。尤其有些高级基本科学研究，其结果在目前可能还用不上，而最近的将来，会发生极大作用的，我们把眼光放远一些，是极有价值的。并且科学研究工作，在时间上也不能要求太紧，限期交卷。因为有不少的研究成果，是在长期刻苦钻研之后偶尔触机而领悟的。甚至有“有意栽花花不发，无心插柳柳成荫”的情况。如青霉素就是偶然发现细菌受了酶的影响，不能繁殖，于是继续研究下去，成为医药上很大的贡献。如果当时因为没有计划，就不给以物质与时间的支持，使其继续研究下去，就可能搁在一边，这个重要的发现就会延缓了若干年才能为人类谋幸福。
    （四）科学工作者的时间问题——科学工作者时间的安排，虽然有了很大的改善，一般都能照周总理的指示，保证以六分之五时间从事于科学工作。但仍有一部分人忙于行政事务工作，和参加不必要的会议。这种情况，生产部门似更严重，应当设法避免。我更进一步的希望国家珍惜科学工作者的精力，最好不要予以“某某长”一类的职衔，与领导行政工作或领导某些社会活动。因为我体会科学工作者以六分之一的时间参加社会活动，其目的是使其不脱离社会实际，似没有使其担任领导工作的必要。还不如让他们专心领导一小组人员向科学领域内进军所得的效果更大些。这里我顺便提一下，有些科学家的助手或学生还少些，如能多给几个人让他领导与培养，则更可节省科学家现在的某些次要工作时间，多多培养新生力量，对将来也有好处的。
    （五）图书资料问题——科学工作者阅读图书杂志、消化前人成就，可以少走弯路，是十分必要的。这好比是军队中的粮秣，极其重要的后勤工作。但在图书资料工作中还存在一些缺点，在此提出，以供各省市图书馆参考：（1）勿多买书，要精选后再买——新办图书馆的往往为了增加藏书数量，无书不买，是不聪明的。应当先请教专家或经杂志上的新书推荐，了解书的内容，对本馆读者的作用大不大，是否邻近图书馆已经收藏可以借阅等等条件，然后再决定买不买。尤其是资本主义国家的书商，为了牟利，竞出新书，而其内容大同小异，只要择优买一、二种即可。（2）勿专买新书，须兼顾旧杂志专刊——科学工作者固然需要新书，但也要旧杂志作参考，尤其我国生产落后，有些国外若干年前的旧资料，却对我国现在实际生产情况大有帮助。但是旧杂志专刊有些已经绝版，补救之法，唯有利用影印本（印在胶片或纸上），价廉、体积小、保管容易。各图书馆应多备放大阅读器，有些图书馆还应有摄影书刊的设备，以利读者。（3）旧图书馆应协助新图书馆——一个具有相当规模的图书馆，须经长期的培养，不是朝夕之功，某些急于求成的倾向是不恰当的，应当纠正。而随着内地新建工业城市的发展，也亟需建立起新图书馆来。因此建议旧图书馆尽量整理出重复的书籍支援新馆，由此旧馆也可空出多余的藏书地方。听说有些大图书馆由于没有地方搁置，未开箱的书很多，以致霉蛀，十分可惜。
    （六）科联和专门学会的问题——科联与其领导下的各专门学会是联系三军的桥梁，在各学会负责人的努力推动下，可以积极发挥会员的作用，也是科学进军中不可缺少的一环。如天津某厂生产直流发电机有98％的产品因整流时火花太大而不合格，经电机工程学会组织了专家深入现场，以两天时间的研究考察，提出改进措施，终使90％以上的产品达到设计要求。天津化工学会协助利中硫酸厂改进设备，使硝酸消耗量降低了三分之二。其他的事例尚多。但仍有些地方的专门学会未能展开多种多样的技术活动，发挥会员们的潜力，或者所起的作用还不很大。今后应当加强这方面的领导；同时科联与各专门学会的活动经费太少，也是实际上的困难，希望能有所增加。
    （七）科学进军中的总的领导问题——三军中应有总的统帅，能担当统帅的大任者，只有中国科学院。有人认为各研究、生产、教学部门都各有其领导，再加上总的领导是否会双重领导，产生流弊？我认为如果中国科学院负起了总领导的责任，它应做的工作是联系各方面，掌握全面发展的平衡，有如银行业中的票据交换所一样。具体工作，可能有以下几种：（1）检定研究题目——各研究单位的研究题目由科学院集中审批，科学院可以指定其是否单独进行或与某单位合作，如已有某单位研究解决了的，就可以不必重复做了。这是防止浪费的最好办法。（2）代为搜集图书资料——各单位送选题时，可附送参考资料清单，科学院可以审查补充；而且科学院藏书最富，与国外图书馆也有联系，如有必要可通过科学院向国外索阅或影印，使工作者在动手前充分掌握资料。（3）协助采购仪器设备——有些必须向国外购置而利用率不大的仪器，科学院即可介绍几个单位合购共用，以节省外汇。有些试验用药品数量不大易为贸易部门忽视，科学院可以集中各部门所需，转告贸易部门采购，可以比较重视，也节省人力（天津南开大学有一次定购一些精细的化学试剂，贸易部门因其量太小，不予采购）。
      （八）思想问题——科学工作者必定是一个辩证唯物主义者，因此他本身必须学习马列主义，不断地提高自己的思想水平，彻底认识了社会主义的优越性和向科学进军的必要性，才能鼓起勇气，完成任务。目前有几种思想情况是值得注意的：（1）必须遵从勤俭建国的号召，学习前辈富兰克林、居里夫妇们刻苦工作忘我劳动的精神。有些人太重视物质条件，脱离了我国现时的可能性，要求有良好的设备图书等，否则便认为无从发挥其能力，这种思想是不恰当的。（2）在现在的物质条件下要养成亲自动手独立作战的本领。如化学师应学自吹玻璃，机械师应会自配零件。有些试验室往往仪器坏了便抱怨没有小工厂承修，不如国外方便等等。照目前情况，有一部分困难须科学家自己动手克服的。（3）还有些人要求参加重点突击工作，参加伟大工程部门，否则就认为自己的工作与向科学进军没有多大关系，贡献不大，甚至发生自卑感。其实科学工作的范围非常广阔，在各个不同岗位上努力都是参加了科学进军。例如飞机制造确很重要，但如没有好油漆就会大大影响飞行的速度与飞机的寿命，所以油漆也是极重要的工业。与飞机工业有同等的重要性。
    最后，在今年增产节约运动中，科学研究经费听说并没有减少，图书购置的外汇听说还有增加，郭院长说科学院今年要建六座大楼，这真是贤明的措施。我作为科学工作者之一，感到异常兴奋。事实上也只有发展科学才是最大的增产节约。例如长芦区的盐平均含氯化钠88％—89％，最低只82％—83％，后经久大永利工厂研究，知道利用该厂蒸铵塔废液中的氯化钙加入盐卤中，就可以使盐中的氯化钠的含量提高到90％—93％。经粗估计，如盐质提高1％后，每年永利碱厂就可以节约十万元左右。所以我们知道增产节约运动与向科学进军的号召，是分不开的，并且在此增产节约运动中，国家是打了大算盘的。我们科学工作者应当努力向科学进军来报答国家对我们的期望。我深信在党、政府和毛主席的领导下，我们科学界的知识分子一定能和工农群众一样地以忘我劳动与艰苦朴素的作风，接受世界的先进技术与承继祖宗的丰富遗产，把我们的祖国建设成为一个富强康乐并且有高度文化水平的国家。（附图片）
