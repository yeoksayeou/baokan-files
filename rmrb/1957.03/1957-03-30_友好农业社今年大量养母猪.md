　　Friendly Agricultural Cooperative Massively Rearing Sows This Year
　　(Our Newspaper News) The Friendly Agricultural Cooperative in Fugou County, Henan Province, plans to raise 7,700 sows this year, an increase of fifteen times compared to the 456 raised last year.
　　In 1955, the Guanzhai Village production team of this agricultural cooperative raised 110 sows and 4 boars, with a total income of 12,080 yuan. The average income per household for the 51 households was over 230 yuan, or 48.7 yuan per person, accounting for 52.5% of the total agricultural income.
　　The management committee of the Friendly Agricultural Cooperative used the example of Guanzhai Village to educate the members and established a pig-raising and manure-collecting committee to strengthen leadership. Last year, it held three commendation meetings for model pig farmers and rewarded eight model units and 147 pig-raising experts. The cooperative's pig-raising industry has rapidly developed, reaching 3,031 head by the end of the year, and plans to increase to 33,950 head this year, including 7,700 sows, an average of 20 per household.

　　友好农业社今年大量养母猪
    本报讯  河南省扶沟县友好农业社今年计划养母猪七千七百头，比去年养的四百五十六头增加十五倍之多。
    这个农业社的官宅村生产队，1955年养一百一十头母猪，四头种猪，共计收入一万二千零八十元，五十一户平均每户收入二百三十多元，每人四十八元七角，占农业总收入的52.5％。
    友好农业社管理委员会用官宅村的事例，向社员进行教育，并成立了养猪积肥委员会，加强领导。去年开了三次评选养猪模范大会，奖励了八个模范单位、一百四十七个养猪能手。全社养猪业迅速发展起来，年底已达到三千零三十一头，并计划在今年内增加到三万三千九百五十头，其中包括母猪七千七百头，平均每户二十头。
