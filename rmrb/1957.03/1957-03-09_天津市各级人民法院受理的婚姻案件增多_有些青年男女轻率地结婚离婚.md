    Tianjin Municipal People's Courts at All Levels Handle More Marriage Cases
    Some Young Men and Women Marry and Divorce Rashly
    (Our newspaper dispatch) According to Tianjin Daily, recent marriage registration work at Tianjin's street offices shows that feudal arranged marriages have been basically eliminated in the city, and harmonious and united families of mutual respect and love are increasing daily. However, judging from the marriage cases handled by the city's People's Courts at all levels last year, some workers, cadres, and citizens still have incorrect attitudes towards marriage and family issues. Last year, the number of marriage cases accepted by the city's People's Courts at all levels increased compared to 1955, with marriage cases accounting for one-third of civil cases. Divorce cases, in particular, accounted for a considerable proportion.
    Judging from these cases, the rash marriage and divorce of some young men and women is a prominent problem at present. In the divorce cases handled by the Hebei District People's Court in the first half of last year, those requesting divorce due to hasty marriages accounted for 12.6%; in the cases tried by the Tanggu District People's Court, cases requesting divorce due to hasty marriages accounted for more than 20% of all divorce cases.
    Some young men and women do not regard marriage as a major event in life, treating it with a serious and responsible attitude, but instead act hastily, even getting married after only one dance, or one or two movies, or a stroll in the park or on the street. One young couple went to the street office to register for marriage and then went back two hours later to cancel the registration. There was also a young couple who got married after seeing a movie together after being introduced by someone; after the marriage, the woman discovered that the man was deaf, mentally unsound, and abused her, so she had to request a divorce. But she was already pregnant. Some young people also simply interpret "freedom of marriage" and "freedom of divorce" as "marrying when you want and divorcing when you want," and even file for divorce over trivial matters in life.
    Love of the new and dislike of the old is also a relatively serious problem reflected in current marriage cases. According to statistics from the Tanggu District People's Court, in the first half of last year, cases requesting divorce due to love of the new and dislike of the old and other reasons accounted for 78% of all divorce cases. Some couples originally had good feelings, but due to changes in living environment and conditions, or the man's increased position and treatment, they looked down on their wives and therefore requested a divorce from the other party. For example, a responsible cadre in a factory, because his position improved, felt that his wife was "not good enough" for him, and had an improper relationship with another woman, and finally proposed a divorce from his wife.

### 天津市各级人民法院受理的婚姻案件增多  有些青年男女轻率地结婚离婚

    天津市各级人民法院受理的婚姻案件增多
    有些青年男女轻率地结婚离婚
    本报讯　据天津日报消息：近年来，天津市各街道办事处结婚登记工作的情况表明，封建包办婚姻在本市已经基本消除；互敬互爱、和睦团结的家庭日益增多。但是，从本市各级人民法院去年审理的婚姻案件看，有部分职工、干部以及市民在对待婚姻、家庭的问题上还存在一些不正确的态度。去年一年本市各级人民法院受理的婚姻案件比1955年有所增加，婚姻案件占了民事案件的三分之一，特别是离婚案件更占有相当大的比重。
    从这些案件看，有些青年男女轻率结婚和轻率离婚是目前一个比较突出的问题。河北区人民法院去年上半年受理的离婚案件中，由于草率结婚而要求离婚的就占12.6％；塘沽区人民法院审理的因草率结婚而要求离婚的案件，占全部离婚案件的20％以上。
    有些青年男女不是把婚姻问题看成生活中的一件大事，采取严肃认真的态度来处理，而是草率从事，甚至只跳过一次舞，或者看过一、两次电影，蹓蹓公园、马路，就忙着张罗结婚。有一对青年男女在街办事处登记结婚以后两小时就又去撤销登记。还有一对青年男女经人介绍，一起看过一次电影就结婚了；婚后女方才发现男方耳聋，精神还不健全，并且虐待她，结果不得不请求离婚。但是她已经怀孕了。还有些青年把“结婚自由”和“离婚自由”，简单地理解为“想结就结，想离就离”，甚至因生活琐事就提出离婚。
    喜新厌旧也是当前婚姻案件中反映出的一个比较严重的问题。据塘沽区人民法院统计，去年上半年由于喜新厌旧等原因而要求离婚的案件占全部离婚案件的78％。有些夫妇本来感情不错，只是由于生活环境、条件的变化或者男方职位、待遇的提高，看不起妻子，因而要求和对方离婚。如某工厂一个负责干部就是因为职位提高以后，觉得妻子“配不上”他，而和另一个女人发生不正当的关系，最后提出和妻子离婚。
