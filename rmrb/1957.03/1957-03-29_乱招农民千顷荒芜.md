    Indiscriminate Recruitment of Peasants Leads to Thousands of Hectares of Land Lying Waste
    Just as spring plowing was beginning, most of the members of the Chunming First Cooperative of Qianwafang Township in the Qian Gorlos Mongolian Autonomous County, Jilin Province, were not working, and thirty members even wanted to withdraw from the cooperative. What was the reason? It turned out that the local state-run Suihua Brick and Gravel Factory had sent them employment certificates, asking them to become workers. This has caused great difficulties for spring plowing and the entire year's production, with an estimated more than one thousand hectares of land unable to be cultivated. We hope that employers will strictly abide by national laws and regulations and not indiscriminately recruit peasants.

    乱招农民千顷荒芜
    正当备耕开始时，吉林省前郭尔罗斯蒙古族自治县前瓦房乡春明一社的大部分社员不干活，而且有三十名社员还要退社。原因何在呢？原来地方国营绥化制砖砂石厂给他们寄来了采用证，要他们去当工人。这样一来，给备耕和今年整个一年的生产都造成了很大的困难，估计有一千多公顷土地无法耕种。我们希望用人单位严格遵守国家法令，不要乱拉农民。  陈国富  齐景祥
