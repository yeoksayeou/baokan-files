According to the People's Highway News: This year, highway construction investment in our country will be mainly focused on routes already under construction, with an emphasis on improving highway trunk lines in ethnic minority areas and supporting industrial and water conservancy construction. It is planned to construct fourteen routes this year, totaling four thousand two hundred and fourteen kilometers, of which two thousand one hundred and six kilometers will be reconstruction routes, and two thousand one hundred and eight kilometers will be new construction routes.

Among the new construction routes, the main one is the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway—from Yecheng in southern Xinjiang, via Saitula, to Ali in Tibet. This is a north-south trunk line running through our country's western border, and the route must pass through desert and plateau areas. The second is the Rongcheng-Weifang line, spanning Shandong. Construction on both of these highways began last year, and will continue to extend forward this year.

The main reconstruction route is the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, which is familiar to everyone. Due to the increasing volume of transportation, reconstruction will continue this year. The second is the reconstruction of highway trunk lines in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai. With the thriving oil exploration in the Qaidam Basin, the original roughly passable routes can no longer meet the busy transportation needs of equipment and supplies. This year, the Changcaogou to Mangai line in this area will be reconstructed, and the Chaka to Mangai line will be renovated with emphasis. Except for three hundred and eighty kilometers of new construction routes that will be completed across 1958, all other new and reconstruction routes will be basically completed this year.

In order to support industrial and water conservancy departments, some construction forces will also be allocated this year to undertake dedicated highway lines in key construction projects, as well as commissioned tasks for other projects.

In addition, in order to prepare for the highway construction tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan, it is planned to determine that the Xi'an to Wanyuan line connecting Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, the Ceheng to Sanjiang line spanning southern Guizhou, the Ranwu to Chayu line in the Tibet region, and the Xigaze to Nyalam lines will all basically complete survey and design work this year.

    今年将建公路四千多公里
    纵贯我国西部边疆南北的新藏公路正继续伸延
    据人民公路报讯　今年我国公路建设投资，主要放在已经开工的路线上，并且以改善少数民族地区的公路干线和支援工业、水利建设为重点。计划今年施工的路线有十四条，共长四千二百一十四公里，其中改建路线二千一百零六公里，新建路线二千一百零八公里。
    新建路线中主要的有新藏公路——从新疆南部的叶城经赛图拉通往西藏的阿里，这是我国西部边疆南北纵贯的一条干线，线路要通过沙漠和高原地带。其次是横贯山东的荣（城）潍（坊）线。这两条公路去年已开始兴建，今年都将继续向前延伸。
    改建路线主要的有大家所熟悉的青藏公路，由于运输量日益增长，今年将继续进行改建。其次是改建青海柴达木地区的公路干线。随着柴达木盆地石油钻探的欣欣向荣，原有粗通路线，已不能适应需用器材和生活品的繁忙运输，今年将改建该地区的长草沟至茫崖线，和重点整修茶卡至茫崖线。所有施工路线除新建路线三百八十公里将跨过1958年完成外，其余新建改建路线都将在今年基本完成。
    为了支援工业、水利部门，今年还将抽出部分施工力量，承建重点建设项目中的专用公路线，以及其他工程的委托任务。
    此外，为了迎接第二个五年计划的公路建设任务，做好准备工作，计划确定：连接川陕两省的西安至万源线、横贯贵州南部的册亨至三江线、西藏地区的然乌至察隅线、日喀则至聂拉木等线，都将在今年基本完成勘测设计工作。
