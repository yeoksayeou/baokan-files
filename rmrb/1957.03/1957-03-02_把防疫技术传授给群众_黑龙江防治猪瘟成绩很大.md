Pass on Epidemic Prevention Techniques to the Masses
Heilongjiang Achieves Great Success in Hog Cholera Prevention

(Our Dispatch) Heilongjiang Province achieved remarkable results in the large-scale hog cholera prevention work carried out last year. Within that year, the number of pigs that died from hog cholera in the province was only 20% of the number that died in 1955. The pigs in Hailun, Suihua, Wangkui, Hulan, Acheng, Yian, Nehe, Shuangcheng, Keshan, and Baiquan counties accounted for one-third of the province's total. During the period of individual peasant economy, these counties were the most severely affected by hog cholera. In 1955, nearly half of the pigs in Nehe County died from hog cholera. However, last year, these ten counties basically eliminated hog cholera by relying on agricultural cooperatives to carry out prevention and control work. Many cooperative members also eliminated their fear of pig diseases and raised a large number of pigs. Therefore, last year, in many areas of the province, even with very difficult feed conditions, the number of pigs raised still increased by 15% compared to 1955.

Hog cholera in Heilongjiang Province usually starts to become epidemic around April each year. In the past, the prevention and control work was entirely handled by veterinary cadres, and the prevention and control effect was not significant. Last year, in the high tide of agricultural cooperation, more than a month before the hog cholera was about to become epidemic, various places began epidemic prevention preparations, and generally held training courses, spending seven or eight days to train epidemic prevention workers for agricultural cooperatives, imparting epidemic prevention injection techniques, so that epidemic prevention work was handled by agricultural cooperatives.

On the basis of widespread preventive injections, agricultural cooperatives and cooperative members were organized to take a number of comprehensive epidemic prevention measures. For example, changing from free-range to pen-raising to reduce the chance of contracting infectious diseases. Doing a good job of pigsty environmental hygiene, and isolating sick pigs, etc.

This province's hog cholera prevention work this year has already begun. They want to ensure that epidemic prevention work is ahead of the epidemic, give each pig more than one injection, and strictly control the epidemic's spread.

    把防疫技术传授给群众
    黑龙江防治猪瘟成绩很大
    本报讯  黑龙江省去年开展的大规模防治猪瘟工作，取得了显著成绩。在这一年内，全省因猪瘟死亡的猪，仅相当于1955年死亡数的20％。海伦、绥化、望奎、呼兰、阿城、依安、讷河、双城、克山、拜泉十个县的猪，占全省的三分之一，在个体农民经济时期，这些县猪瘟最严重。1955年讷河县的猪因猪瘟死亡了将近一半。但去年这十个县由于依靠农业社进行了防治工作，基本上消灭了猪瘟。许多社员也消除了怕猪病死的顾虑，大量养猪。因而去年全省很多地区在饲料很困难的情况下，养猪数量仍然比1955年增加了15％。
    黑龙江省的猪瘟，通常在每年4月间开始流行，防治工作一向全由兽医干部包下来做，防治效果不大。去年，在农业合作化的高潮中，还在猪瘟将要流行的一个多月以前，各地都开始了防疫准备工作，并普遍开办训练班，用七、八天时间给农业社训练防疫员，传授防疫注射技术，使防疫工作由农业社去办。
    在普遍进行预防注射的基础上，组织农业社和社员采取了多项综合性防疫措施。例如改变散养为圈养，减少传染疫病的机会。做好猪舍环境卫生，和病猪隔离等。
    这个省今年的猪瘟防治工作已经开始。他们要做到防疫工作走在疫病前面，给每头猪注射一次以上，严密控制疫病流行。
