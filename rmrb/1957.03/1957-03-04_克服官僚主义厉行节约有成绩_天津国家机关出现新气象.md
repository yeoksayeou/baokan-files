Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd. As demonstrated by the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee's administrative meeting today, many municipal-level organs in Tianjin have shown many new features after implementing the twenty preliminary regulations on overcoming bureaucracy and practicing economy.

In mid-January, the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee formulated twenty preliminary regulations on leading cadres going deep into the grassroots, streamlining institutions and levels, and reducing meetings, documents, and reports, which also stipulated that every Thursday would be a "meeting-free day for municipal-level organs" to facilitate leading cadres to go deep into the grassroots on this day. According to the inspection at today's meeting, all organs have achieved results in implementing these regulations. In last week's "meeting-free day," in the twenty-four units investigated by the Municipal People's Committee, only three units had meetings, and thirty of the fifty-two leading cadres went deep into the grassroots to work on this day. In the past month or so, the sections of the municipal-level commissions and bureaus have not convened section chief meetings at the district level, giving grassroots cadres more time to handle daily work.

The city's three-level system of organs has been almost entirely changed to a two-level system. The Municipal People's Committee has streamlined personnel by 39%, of which the First and Seventh Offices and the Archives Management Office have streamlined more than half of their staff. The streamlined personnel are now being actively resettled.

According to the inspection, after the organs streamlined official documents and forms, the average saving of office paper was halved. From January 20 to February 20, the Municipal People's Committee issued 41% fewer documents than in the same period last year, and received 69% fewer documents. After the city stopped publishing six unnecessary printed publications, it can save 117 reams of paper this year. The phenomenon of lengthy instructions and reports has also changed.

Many organs have also removed redundant telephone equipment and reduced excessive light intensity. Due to the preliminary rational adjustment of the use of automobiles, gasoline consumption in January decreased by nearly half compared with December last year.

    克服官僚主义厉行节约有成绩
    天津国家机关出现新气象
    据新华社天津2日电  据今天举行的天津市人民委员会行政会议的检查证明，天津许多市级机关在执行关于克服官僚主义和厉行节约的二十条初步规定后，出现了许多新的气象。
    天津市人民委员会在1月中旬对领导干部深入基层以及精简机构、层次，减少会议、文件、报告等作出了二十条初步规定，其中并规定每星期四为“市级各机关无会议日”，便于领导干部利用这一天深入基层。据今天会上的检查，各机关执行这些规定都取得了成绩。在上周的“无会议日”里，在市人民委员会进行调查的二十四个单位中，只有三个单位有会议，五十二个领导干部中有三十人在这一天深入到基层进行工作。市级各委、局的各科，在最近一个多月中都没有再召开过区一级的科长会议，使基层干部有更多的时间来处理日常工作。
    全市三级制的机关已几乎全部改为两级制。市人民委员会已精简人员39％，其中第一和第七办公室以及档案管理处共精简了工作人员一半以上。被精简的人员现正在积极进行安置中。
    据检查，各机关精简公文、表报后，办公用纸平均节省了一半。市人民委员会1月20日到2月20日发文比去年同期减少41％，收文减少69％。全市停止出版六种不必要的铅印刊物后，今年就可以省纸一百一十七令。指示、报告冗长的现象也有了改变。
    许多机关还撤销了多余的电话设备，减少了过强的电灯光度。由于初步合理地调整了汽车的使用办法，1月份汽油消耗量比去年12月下降近一半。
