Xinhua News Agency, March 4th, Budapest dispatch: According to a report in the "People's Liberty" newspaper on the 3rd, the membership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party has now increased to 200,000.

The newspaper's editorial on this matter pointed out that the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party has once again gained new influence in public life. Although many people recently expressed doubts about the possibility of reorganizing the party, and many others believed that the socialist cause in Hungary was finished, it can be said that the most outstanding members of the former Hungarian Working People's Party have mostly joined the new party, and the proportion of miners participating in the new party is relatively large, which means that the new party will be stronger than the old party, although the new party has only a quarter of the members of the old party.

The editorial wrote, "We hope to continue to expand the party's ranks by absorbing the best workers and those who most trust our principles. However, we are unwilling to increase our membership by any means."

    匈社会主义工人党党员达二十万人
    新华社4日讯  据匈牙利通讯社布达佩斯讯：“人民自由报”3日报道，匈牙利社会主义工人党的党员人数目前已经增加到二十万人。
    报纸就这件事发表的社论指出，匈牙利社会主义工人党目前在公众生活中重新获得了新的影响。尽管最近还有许多人对改组党的可能性表示怀疑，还有许多人认为社会主义事业在匈牙利已经完蛋了，但是人们可以说，前匈牙利劳动人民党最优秀的党员大部分都加入了新党，而参加新党的人以矿工所占的比例较大，这就意味着新党将比旧党强大，虽然新党的党员人数只有旧党的四分之一。
    社论写道，我们希望继续吸收最好的劳动者和最信任我们的原则的人来扩大党的队伍。但是，我们不愿意不择手段地来获得我们党员人数的增加。
