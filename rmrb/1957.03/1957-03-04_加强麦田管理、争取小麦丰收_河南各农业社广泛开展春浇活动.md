Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, March 3rd. Agricultural cooperatives in Henan Province are strengthening wheat field management in an effort to achieve a bumper wheat harvest.

Of the more than 70 million mu of wheat in the province, over 20 million mu are experiencing drought due to the lack of rain and snow last winter. At present, agricultural cooperatives in drought-stricken areas are widely carrying out spring irrigation activities. Large canals such as the Yellow River diversion canals, Dandong Canal, and Xingfu Canal in Xinxiang and Anyang Prefectures have been universally opened to release water for irrigating wheat. Members of agricultural cooperatives in various regions are also installing water lifting tools on the many wells that have already been dug, preparing to irrigate the wheat.

Agricultural cooperatives in various regions also attach great importance to accumulating and applying fertilizer to wheat. Xuchang Prefecture is carrying out activities such as topdressing, soil compaction, and irrigation of wheat fields. A high tide of fertilizer accumulation and application has formed in Changge County. Xinxiang Prefecture, which has a higher wheat yield, has already applied topdressing to half of its wheat fields. In Meng County, Wen County, Huojia County, Hui County, and other counties, the wheat fields that have been topdressed have reached more than 70%.

In a recent directive on launching a spring production campaign, the Henan Provincial People's Committee called on all regions to make earnest efforts to strengthen wheat field management and strive for a bumper wheat harvest as the primary task in spring production, ensuring that most wheat fields receive one topdressing and that 25 million mu of wheat are irrigated in the spring. Party and government leading organs at all levels in the province have dispatched cadres to the countryside to strengthen leadership over production. According to recent statistics, four prefectures, including Nanyang, Xinxiang, Luoyang, and Xinyang, have dispatched a total of more than 12,000 cadres to the countryside to help township and cooperative cadres lead agricultural production. At present, the attendance rate of agricultural cooperative members in various regions has reached about 50%, and some have reached 80%.

    加强麦田管理、争取小麦丰收
    河南各农业社广泛开展春浇活动
    新华社郑州3日电  河南省各地农业社正在加强麦田管理，力争小麦丰收。
    全省七千多万亩小麦中，有两千多万亩因去年冬季雨雪较少而发生旱象。目前受旱地区的农业社正在广泛开展春浇活动。新乡、安阳两专区的引黄、丹东、幸福等大型渠道已经普遍开闸放水，灌溉小麦。各地农业社的社员们还在已经打成的许多水井上安装提水工具，准备浇麦。
    各地农业社还很重视为小麦积肥和追肥。许昌专区正在开展麦田追肥、镇压和灌溉等活动。长葛县的积肥追肥运动已经形成高潮。小麦产量较高的新乡专区，已经有一半麦田施过追肥。孟县、温县、获嘉、辉县等县施过追肥的麦田已经达到70％以上。
    河南省人民委员会在最近发出的开展春季生产运动的指示中，要求各地以认真加强麦田管理争取小麦丰收，当作春季生产中的首要任务，做到大部麦田增施一次追肥，并且春浇小麦两千五百万亩。全省各级党、政领导机关都调派干部下乡，加强对生产的领导。据最近统计，南阳、新乡、洛阳、信阳等四个专区已经抽调共一万二千多名干部下乡，帮助乡、社干部领导农业生产。现在各地农业社社员的出勤率都已经达到50％左右，有的已经达到80％。
