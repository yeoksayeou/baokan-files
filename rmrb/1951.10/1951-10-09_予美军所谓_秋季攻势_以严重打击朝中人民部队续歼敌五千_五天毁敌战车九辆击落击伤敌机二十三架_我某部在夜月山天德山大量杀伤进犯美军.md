    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 8th: A front-line reporter for this agency reports: According to statistics for the last five days of September, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army annihilated more than 5,200 enemy troops in blocking and counter-attacking battles, including more than 2,500 U.S. invading troops, more than 2,400 Li puppet troops, and 290 British and French accomplice troops. In addition, our army destroyed a total of nine enemy tanks, thirty-three vehicles, and shot down or damaged twenty-three enemy aircraft over the front and rear.
    While the U.S. side continues to obstruct the resumption of the Korean armistice talks, Van Fleet, in order to once again cover up the disastrous defeat of his so-called "offensive with limited objectives" and to create new military adventures, issued a statement on September 30, frantically claiming that his so-called "Autumn Offensive" had begun on September 25. But as soon as this "offensive" was launched, the U.S. invading army and its accomplice troops immediately suffered even more severe blows than in the past. Since the end of September, the enemy's offensive focus has shifted from the demoralized eastern and east-central sectors to the west-central sector. From September 29 to October 1, our unit successively annihilated more than a thousand U.S. invading troops in the blocking battles at Yeyue Mountain and Tiande Mountain (both located west-southwest of Tieyuan) in this area, inflicting a heavy blow on the invading enemy.
    In the area north of Yangkou on the eastern front, our army also continued to annihilate a large number of invading enemies in increasingly stronger blocking and counter-attacking battles. One of our units is still firmly defending the 1211 height, which is called "Heartbreak Ridge" by the enemy, and killed or wounded more than 250 enemy troops in a battle in a mountainous area south of the height. In the east-central sector, our army continues to repel the incursions of small groups of enemy troops and has launched small-scale counter-attacks in some areas.
    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 8th: A front-line reporter for this agency reports on the process of the Tiande Mountain blocking battle: A regiment of U.S. invading troops, supported by twenty-five tanks and aircraft, fiercely attacked our Tiande Mountain position west of Yeyue Mountain on the 2nd. Although the enemy frantically attacked for a whole day, they were completely repelled by our few defending troops, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties. That morning, our infantry and artillerymen stationed at Tiande Mountain prepared enough ammunition. When the enemy's artillery and aircraft bombed and strafed, and the infantry advanced toward our position, our army suddenly launched artillery fire, and enemies fell in batches. Enemy officers used pistols to force their soldiers to crawl forward. Our army waited for the enemy to approach the forward edge of the position before launching a heroic fight. Our eight soldiers repelled eight charges from thirty enemies with grenades and submachine guns, and then repelled three more charges from the enemy in the afternoon. In the fierce battle, when the enemy approached our mortar position, ammunition handler Yan Qiwan jumped out of the fortifications and killed four enemies. Squad leader Shang Yuzhi fired fifty-six grenades and six hundred rounds of submachine gun bullets at the enemy. He quickly threw enemy grenades that landed beside him back at the enemy. Mortarmen Yin Zheng and Li Fangzhi, seeing the enemy approaching the position, and finding it inconvenient to fire as usual, held the mortar tubes almost at right angles and fired more than sixty shells at the enemy. The battle lasted from morning until dark. Our few defending troops repelled more than ten enemy charges, and the enemy's abandoned corpses were scattered all over the front of our position.

    予美军所谓“秋季攻势”以严重打击
    朝中人民部队续歼敌五千
    五天毁敌战车九辆击落击伤敌机二十三架
    我某部在夜月山天德山大量杀伤进犯美军
    【新华社朝鲜前线八日电】本社前线记者报道：据九月份最后五天的统计，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军又在阻击战和反击战中歼灭敌军五千二百余人，其中美国侵略军两千五百余人，李伪军两千四百余人，英国和法国帮凶军二百九十余人。另外我军共击毁敌战车九辆、汽车三十三辆，并在前线和后方的上空击落、击伤敌机二十三架。
    当美方继续阻挠恢复朝鲜停战谈判会议的时候，范佛里特为再次掩盖其所谓“目标有限的攻势”的惨败和制造新的军事冒险，曾在九月三十日发表声明，狂叫自九月二十五日开始其所谓“秋季攻势”。但这个“攻势”一发动，美国侵略军及其帮凶军就立即遭到比过去更加严重的打击。九月底以来，敌军进攻的重点从被打得垂头丧气的东线和中线偏东地区转向中线偏西地区。九月二十九日到十月一日我军某部先后在这个地区的夜月山、天德山（均位铁原西偏南）的阻击战中，痛歼千余名美国侵略军，给予犯敌以严重的打击。
    在东线杨口以北地区，我军也继续在愈加坚强的阻击战和反击战中歼灭大量犯敌。我军某部仍然坚守着被敌军称为“伤心岭”的一二一一高地，并在该高地以南一个山地的战斗中，杀伤了二百五十多名敌军。在中线偏东地区，我军仍不断击退小股敌军的进犯，并在有些地区举行小规模的反击战。
    【新华社朝鲜前线八日电】本社前线记者报道天德山阻击战的经过情形：美国侵略军一个团在二十五辆坦克和飞机的配合下，在二日猛犯我夜月山以西的天德山阵地。敌军虽然疯狂地攻击了整整一天，结果却被我少数守军完全击退，敌军遭受了大量伤亡。那天早晨守在天德山的我军步兵和炮兵们准备了足够的弹药。当敌军大炮和飞机轰击、扫射后、步兵向我阵地进逼时，我军突然发射炮火，敌人一批一批地倒下去。敌军军官以手枪威迫着他们的士兵爬进。我军等敌人逼近阵地前沿时，就展开了英勇的搏斗。我八个战士用手榴弹和冲锋枪打退了三十个敌人的八次冲锋，接着又在下午打退了敌人的三次冲锋。在激战中，当敌人逼到我迫击炮阵地时，弹药手阎启万跃出工事，杀死四个敌人。八班长尚玉芝向敌人打出了五十六个手榴弹和六百发冲锋枪子弹。他把落在身边的敌人的手榴弹迅速投还敌人。迫击炮手尹正和李芳芝见敌逼近阵地，不便照常射击，即抱着炮筒几乎成直角地向敌人发射了六十余发炮弹。战斗从早晨一直打到天黑，我少数守军打退了敌人十余次冲锋，敌军遗弃的尸体满布我阵地前沿。
