Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th: According to TASS, Moscow, 11th, the Soviet-Chinese Film Festival, held in the Soviet Union to celebrate the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, has concluded. During the ten days of the film festival, Chinese feature films and documentaries were shown in thirty major cities across the Soviet Union, attracting millions of viewers. In Moscow alone, there were over one million viewers. This film festival was a major event in Soviet cultural life, demonstrating the great achievements of the young Chinese film industry. Soviet newspapers, filmmakers, and audiences have given high praise to these achievements.

    Pravda, in its review of the Chinese feature film "The White Haired Girl," pointed out: This film demonstrates the outstanding advantages of the modern Chinese film industry—faithfulness to life, closeness to the people, unpretentious and expressive. The famous Soviet film director Gerasimov said: The development and progress of the Chinese film industry demonstrate the general and vigorous development of the new Chinese culture, the great display of the Chinese people's creative ability, and their ardent desire to establish international peace, friendship, and cooperation. Some actors from the National Opera and Ballet Theatre in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, said: The characteristics of Chinese films are: profound ideological content, genuine realism, and the ability to make rich social generalizations in artistic expression. From these works, one can see the close connection between Chinese film artists and the people, as well as their active participation in the construction of a new life.

    The Chinese film workers delegation, headed by Yu Ling, director of the Shanghai Film Studio, participated in the film festival. Members of the delegation met with Soviet audiences in cities such as Moscow, Leningrad, Tbilisi, and Baku. Many theaters and workers' clubs that screened Chinese films also held exhibitions and lectures, promoting the Chinese people's struggle to defend peace and the great friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people, which achieved great success.
