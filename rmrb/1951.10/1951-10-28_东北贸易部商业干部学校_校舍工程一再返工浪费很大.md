    Northeast Trade Department Commercial Cadre School
    Repeated Reworking of School Building Project Results in Significant Waste

    Editor:

    The classroom, dormitory, and other construction projects of the Commercial Cadre School of the Northeast People's Government Trade Department in Shenyang were entrusted by the department's Basic Construction Engineering Office to the private Dafeng Construction Company (a Class B construction company without design qualifications) and Qikang and Xingyuan Construction Companies (Class C construction companies without design qualifications) for design and construction. During the design phase, the three companies only visited the site once and did not conduct soil bearing capacity tests. The Basic Construction Engineering Office also did not visit the site for review and blindly approved the design. When construction was about to begin, responsible personnel from the Commercial Cadre School, the Basic Construction Engineering Office, and the three companies inspected the terrain at the construction site. Seeing that neighboring projects were driving piles due to quicksand beneath the foundation, they did not conduct a detailed investigation and research on the site. They decided to start construction by excavating the foundation trenches and initially determined that each square meter of the classroom and dormitory foundation trenches would be driven with three three-meter piles. After excavation began on July 4th this year, it was discovered that the soil was too loose and there was quicksand below. One side of the foundation trench was too low, at 0.85 meters from the ground surface, which is above the freezing layer of 1.2 meters in Shenyang. Therefore, the foundation trench needed to be widened and deepened. The Basic Construction Engineering Office then decided to change the design. Due to the repeated changes in the foundation trench design, the construction period was extended by twenty days, an additional 8,000 labor days were used, and 4,400 three-meter piles were used. According to incomplete statistics, an additional budget of more than 1 billion yuan is required. I believe that the leadership of the Northeast People's Government Trade Department should correct the irresponsible attitude of the department's Basic Construction Engineering Office in blindly approving designs and promptly conduct a thorough study of the Commercial Cadre School's engineering design to avoid similar situations from occurring again.

### 东北贸易部商业干部学校  校舍工程一再返工浪费很大

    东北贸易部商业干部学校
    校舍工程一再返工浪费很大编辑同志：
    东北人民政府贸易部商业干部学校在沈阳修建的教室、宿舍等工程，是由该部基本建设工程处委托私营大丰建筑公司（乙种建筑公司无设计资格）和企康、兴源两建筑公司（丙种建筑公司无设计资格）负责设计施工的。在设计时，三家公司只到现场看了一次，未做土地耐力试验。基本建设工程处亦未到现场审核，便盲目批准了设计。当要开工时，商业干部学校、基本建设工程处以及三家公司的负责人员到施工现场察看地形，见到邻近工程因地基下面有流砂，正在打桩，他们没有对本工地进行详细的调查研究，就决定先施工开槽，并初步确定教室及宿舍的地槽，每平方公尺各打三根三公尺桩。今年七月四日开槽后，发现土质太松，下面有流砂；地槽有一面地形太低，距地表面零点八五公尺处，在沈阳冻层一点二公尺以上。因此，地槽还需加宽加深。基本建设工程处又决定改变设计。由于地槽设计屡次变更，致延长工期二十天，多用劳动力八千个，三公尺桩四千四百根。据不完全统计，需追加预算十亿元以上。我认为东北人民政府贸易部领导方面应纠正该部基本建设工程处盲目批准设计的不负责任态度，从速将商业干部学校的工程设计周密研究，避免再发生类似情形。
