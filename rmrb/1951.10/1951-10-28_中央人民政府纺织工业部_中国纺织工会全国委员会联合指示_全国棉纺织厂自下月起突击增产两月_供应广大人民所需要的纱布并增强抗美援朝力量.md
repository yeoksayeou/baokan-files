    To meet the needs of the broad masses of people for yarn and cloth, and to strengthen the forces resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government, in accordance with the decision of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, jointly issued a directive on a production surge with the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China. The directive stipulates that all public and private cotton textile factories across the country shall launch a two-month production surge starting on November 1st. Factories that originally operate on a two-shift system, with each shift working ten hours, will add one shift per week, or add one hour per shift. To avoid excessive worker fatigue, no extra work is allowed after overtime; no overtime is allowed after extra work. Those originally operating on three shifts will uniformly increase to twenty shifts per week. During the production surge, for two-shift systems, the factory will provide an additional 50% of the wage for the overtime portion. Overtime wages will be increased by 100% by the factory (but those originally operating two shifts a day, six days and seven nights a week, will not be considered overtime). At the same time, to protect the health of employees, every employee participating in extra work will receive a subsidy of two eggs per day from the factory.
    The directive requires textile factories in all regions to immediately organize mobilization, to bring into play the patriotic labor enthusiasm of the masses of workers, to improve output, ensure quality, save raw materials, maintain and carry forward the honor of last year’s surge production of 20-count yarn, and complete the glorious production increase task assigned by the state this year.
