    Chuxian County Health Center Should Correct the Phenomenon of Not Caring About People's Illnesses

    Wang Yinglong, a leather worker in Chuxian County, Northern Anhui, had a twelve-year-old son who suddenly contracted cerebrospinal meningitis on the night of August 13th. Wang Yinglong and his wife asked the street leader to write a report to the district government requesting help in finding a doctor, but to no avail. Three days later, Wang's wife went to the Chuxian County Health Center for help. The hospital sent a nurse who casually looked at the child at Wang's home and said, "The child has bacteria in his brain and cannot be cured," and then turned around and left. Li Jinkui, a political instructor from the Chuxian Military Subdistrict's Party Training Class, learned about this and found a health worker to see Wang's child. By this time, the child's illness had turned from cerebrospinal meningitis into meningitis. After four days of diagnosis and treatment, the health worker gave the child sulfonamide and antipyretic drugs, and the child's condition gradually improved. This shows that the child's illness was not "incurable." The county health center's lack of concern for the people and its perfunctory attitude towards the child's illness is wrong.

    滁县卫生院应纠正不关心群众疾病的现象
    皖北滁县皮匠工人汪应龙的一个十二岁的儿子，八月十三日夜忽然得了脑脊髓病。汪应龙老夫妇要求街长写了报告到区政府，请求帮助请医生，但没有结果。过了三天，汪大娘又到滁县卫生院求救。该院派了一个护士，到汪家随便看了看，说是“小孩子脑里有细菌，无法治”，转身就走了。滁县军分区党员训练班政治指导员李金奎同志知道了这件事，就去找了卫生员给汪家的小孩看病。这时，孩子的病已经由脑脊髓病转成了脑膜炎。卫生员经过四天的诊治，给小孩吃了磺胺咪锭、解热剂等药后，小孩的病便渐渐好了。这样看来，孩子的病并不是“无法治”，县卫生院不关心群众，对孩子的病采取敷衍态度，是不对的。
