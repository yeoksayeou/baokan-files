Write Good Reportage to Quickly Reflect the Leaping Progress of the Motherland
    ——After Reading Four Dispatches from the Korean Battlefield
    Liu Jianqing

    In the past year, nearly a thousand dispatches from the Korean battlefield have added much glory to our literary cause. The broad masses of people have breathed the spirit of heroes from these dispatches and received education in patriotic thought. Recently, I have read many Korean dispatches, some of which, such as "Who Are the Most Lovable People," have already resonated with the people and become a force for progress in their daily lives and work. These have already received widespread acclaim. In addition, I believe that four pieces, such as "Days and Nights on the South Bank of the Han River" (by Wei Wei, People's Daily, March 24), "Eleven Days and Nights on Baiyun Mountain" (by Lin Wei, People's Daily, March 31), "Victory and Life" (by Wei Chen, Yangtze Daily, June 5), and "The Immortal Man" (by Li Keyi, People's Daily, June 9), are also noteworthy and good works.

    These four Korean dispatches have a common characteristic: they are all written with flesh and blood, and relatively essentially reflect the excellent qualities of the volunteer soldiers, which are very moving to read. Let's look at Zhang Caishu, the hero of the Volunteer Army in "Victory and Life." From his heroic and indomitable character and great heroic actions, it is fully demonstrated that he is a people's soldier with a high degree of political consciousness and noble thought. He once took a blood-stained handkerchief from the corpse of a Korean woman and kept it in his pocket. He silently made a vow to the handkerchief to avenge her: "If I, Zhang Caishu, do not avenge the Korean folks and avenge their hatred, I will be sorry to the Korean people and the people of the motherland! American beasts, don't even think about bringing this disaster into my motherland again!" Before the Imjin River operation, he wrote a letter of determination. His task was to clear mines, and he vowed:
     “In the operation to break through the Imjin River, I guarantee
    to complete the mine-clearing task. If the hook breaks, I will
    pull with my hands; if my hands are blown off, I will kick
    with my feet; if my feet are blown off, I will roll over with my body.
    Resolutely complete the task and let the assault platoon pass
    smoothly and make contributions.”
    He finally fulfilled his promise, persisting in clearing mines until he was seriously injured, and then rolled into the minefield with his body, clearing a bloody path for the heroic assault platoon. This great heroic character of sacrificing bravely for the motherland and the Korean people can also be found in the hero Wang Jingzhou in "The Immortal Man." Wang Jingzhou was among the first batch of Chinese railway workers to volunteer to aid Korea by crossing the river. He worked at a station in the rear of Korea. Enemy planes dropped dozens of time bombs on both sides of the station, seriously threatening our military transportation. When he saw that six or seven workers had already dug out the time bombs from the ballast with their hands, he immediately carried the time bomb on his shoulder and ran out of the station in the dark. After returning, everyone scrambled to carry another time bomb, but he pushed everyone away and said, "I have already made 'friends' with these guys, it won't blow me up, I'll do it!" He didn't consider the danger, but considered that "if it explodes, this line cannot be used, and it cannot run if it is on the line."

    The heroic soldiers of the Volunteer Army closely link the victory of the Korean War with the safety of the motherland. For the sake of victory and for the sake of the motherland, they can fearlessly contribute their lives. However, what is most lovable and touching about them is not only the heroic spirit of brave sacrifice, but more importantly, their fighting spirit of optimism and their iron-like will to win. As in "Days and Nights on the South Bank of the Han River," a commander—the political commissar of the division—said to his subordinates on the phone: "...What is the ability to win against the enemy with planes and cannons? From the history of the revolution, the weapons of the counter-revolutionaries are always much better than ours, but it is always they who fail, not us. Don't say that we have surpassed them in this regard, if it is once balanced, or close to balanced, they will cease to exist! Today, our weapons are not as good as the enemy, and it is under such conditions that we still have to defeat him, that is where our ability lies!" Similarly, in "Eleven Days and Nights on Baiyun Mountain," this ideological characteristic can also be clearly seen. One of the battle scenes is very intense. The enemy used eight planes and twelve artillery pieces to bombard our small woods position for a full two hours, "The ground was beaten like a boiling pot, with smoke and clouds obscuring the sky. ...The ground became a large honeycomb." However, the heroic soldiers of the Volunteer Army still held their ground after repelling three enemy assaults. Moreover, while monitoring the enemy, they also victoriously laughed and said, "If we don't retreat ourselves, the enemy will never have a way." "We are not afraid of the enemy, the enemy is afraid of us." "Aim accurately, one burst will do the trick." What force is supporting their optimism and heroic and tenacious spirit? The author of "Days and Nights on the South Bank of the Han River" answered this question relatively essentially and vividly. One of the soldiers, Wang Zhicheng, said: "In the old society, my mother sold me to others, and my mother cried like a fountain, but I didn't shed a tear. But this time when I went to Korea, I saw the Korean people suffering so much from the American devils, and I cried. ...If the American devils attack our motherland, bombing like this, burning like this...!" Obviously, these heroic soldiers, who are praised by the people as "the most lovable people," are those who can defend the happiness and security of the motherland and the people with their lives, love mankind, and become strong fighters in defense of world peace. Their fighting optimism and unparalleled heroic strength are also produced on the ideological basis of this highly combined patriotism and internationalism.

    Although these four Korean dispatches are not perfect, the authors went into the fierce Korean War and wrote heroic figures like Zhang Caishu and Wang Jingzhou, giving people great emotion and unforgettable impressions, which is obviously worthy of encouragement. It is not difficult for us to find some unhealthy and backward phenomena in general literary works in depicting new hero models, thinking that new hero models also have shortcomings, and that not describing or omitting these shortcomings is "untrue"; or only listing their heroic model deeds, but neglecting to describe their most precious inner and true thoughts and feelings, thus handling the characters in a formulaic way. The reasons for this phenomenon are not difficult to understand. We can get a lot of inspiration from the not-yet-complete heroic images of Zhang Caishu, Wang Jingzhou, etc., which once again confirms that only when the author goes deep into the actual struggle life and stands firm on the revolutionary position can he understand the true thoughts and feelings of the hero model figures, and can he correctly shape their heroic image.

    Finally, these excellent dispatches and reports also prove that the literary form of dispatches and reports is a powerful form and worthy of great promotion. At present, our country's construction work in all aspects is progressing by leaps and bounds; a great anti-aggression war is being waged on the Korean front, and new heroic models are constantly emerging and growing. In order to timely reflect the great reality of the motherland, quickly spread advanced things, and become a force to lead and inspire the people, it is clear that dispatches and reports are the most suitable literary form. The excellent reportage works that appeared in the Resist America and Aid Korea movement powerfully refuted the erroneous view that reportage cannot deeply write about characters. In the struggle, our heroic figures are no longer a small number of existences. In order to educate the people, we have the responsibility to quickly and accurately reflect these heroic figures and great struggles.

    写好报告文学，迅速反映飞跃进展中的祖国
    ——读四篇朝鲜战场通讯后
    刘剑青
    一年来，近千篇的朝鲜战场通讯，给我们的文学事业增加了不少光彩。广大人民群众从这些通讯里，呼吸到了英雄的气息，获得了爱国主义思想的教育。最近，我读了许多篇朝鲜通讯，其中有一些如“谁是最可爱的人”等，已在人民群众中激起共鸣，成为人们日常生活和工作中鼓舞前进的力量。那是已经获得普遍好评的。此外，我认为像“汉江南岸的日日夜夜”（魏巍作，人民日报三月二十四日）、“白云山十一昼夜”（林韦作，人民日报三月三十一日）、“胜利和生命”（魏晨作、长江日报六月五日）、“不朽的人”（李克异作、人民日报六月九日）等四篇，也是值得注意的好作品。
    这四篇朝鲜通讯有一个共同的特点：都写得有血有肉，比较本质地反映了志愿军战士的优秀品质，读起来令人非常感动。让我们看一看“胜利和生命”中的志愿军英雄张才树吧，从他那英勇顽强的性格和伟大的英雄行动上，充分显现了他是具有高度政治觉悟和崇高思想的人民战士。他曾从一个朝鲜妇女尸体上，取来一方血迹斑斑的手巾，保存在自己口袋里。他对着这手巾默默地立下了为她复仇的誓言：“我张才树不给朝鲜老乡报了仇，雪了恨，对不起朝鲜人民和祖国人民！美国野兽呀，你莫想再把这灾难带进我的祖国！”在临津江作战前，他写了一个决心书。他的任务是扫除地雷，他发誓：
     “突破临津江作战，我保正（证）完成排雷任
    务，勾（钩）子炸断了，我用手拉；手炸断了，
    我用脚踢；脚炸断了，我用身子滚。坚决完成任
    务，给突击排顺立（利）通过，立功。”
    他终于实现了自己的诺言，坚持扫除地雷，一直到身负重伤后，以自己的身体滚进了地雷阵，给突击排英雄们扫开一条血路。这种为了祖国和朝鲜人民壮烈牺牲的伟大的英雄性格，在“不朽的人”中的英雄王景洲身上，同样可以发现。王景洲是参加第一批中国铁路职工志愿援朝大队过江的。他在朝鲜后方的一个车站工作。敌机在车站两旁投下几十颗定时炸弹，严重地威胁着我们的军事运输。当他看见已经有六、七个工人从石碴里把定时炸弹用手抠出来后，立刻把定时炸弹扛在肩上，在黑夜里向着站外跑去。回来后，大家抢着要扛另一个定时炸弹时，他推开大家说：“我和这几个家伙已经交‘朋友’了，它炸不了我，还是我来！”他并没有考虑到危险不危险的问题，却考虑到“如果等它爆炸了，这条线就不能使用，由它在线路上，也不能行车”。
    志愿军的英雄们把朝鲜战争的胜利和祖国的安全紧密地联系在一起。为了胜利，为了祖国，他们可以无所畏惧地贡献出自己的生命。然而他们最可爱最令人感动的地方，还不仅仅是那种壮烈牺牲的英雄气魄，更重要的是，他们充满着战斗的乐观主义精神，如铁如钢的必胜意志。如“汉江南岸的日日夜夜”中，一个指挥员——师政治委员，给他下级打电话时说：“……有飞机大炮才能打胜敌人算什么本事呢？从革命的历史来看，反革命的武器总是比我们好得多，然而失败的总是他们，而不是我们。不要说在这方面超过他们，假若一旦平衡，或者接近平衡，他们就会不存在了！今天，我们的武器不如敌人，就是在这样的条件下，我们还要战胜他，我们的本事就在这里！”同样，在“白云山十一昼夜”中，也可以很清楚地看出这一思想特点。其中有一节战斗场面是非常激烈的，敌人用八架飞机和十二门大炮对我们一个小树林的阵地轰击了整整两小时，“地面打得像开水锅一样，腾起蔽空的烟云。……地面变成了大蜂窝。”可是，志愿军的英雄战士们，在打退敌人三次冲锋后，仍然坚持阵地。而且，他们一面监视敌人，一面又胜利地说笑着：“我们自己不退，敌人永远没有办法。”“我们不怕敌人，敌人就怕我们。”“瞄得准准地，一梭子就管事。”什么力量在支持他们的乐观主义和英勇顽强的精神呢？“汉江南岸的日日夜夜”的作者，比较本质而又生动地回答了这个问题。其中一位战士王志成说：“在旧社会的时候，我母亲把我卖给别人，我母亲哭得像泪人一样，但我没有掉一滴眼泪。可是这一次到朝鲜，我看见朝鲜老百姓被美国鬼子害得那么苦，我哭了。……假若美国鬼子打到我们的祖国，像这样的炸，像这样的烧………！”很明显，这些英雄战士们，所以被人民赞誉为“最可爱的人”，就是他们能以自己的生命捍卫着祖国和人民的幸福的安全，热爱人类，成为保卫世界和平的坚强战士。他们战斗的乐观情绪和无可匹敌的英勇力量，也就产生在这种爱国主义与国际主义高度结合的思想基础上。
    这四篇朝鲜通讯，虽然不十全十美，但是，作者们投入到激烈的朝鲜战争中去，写出像张才树、王景洲那样的英雄人物，给人巨大的感动和难忘的印象，显然是值得鼓励的。我们不难发现一般文艺作品在描写新的英雄模范人物上，往往出现一些不健康的落后现象，以为新的英雄模范人物也有缺点，不描写或遗漏这缺点，就是“不真实”；或者只罗列他们的英雄模范事迹，却忽略描写他们最宝贵的内在的真实思想感情，因而把人物处理得公式化。造成这种现象的原因，是不难理解的。我们从张才树、王景洲等还不算完整的英雄形象上却可以得到很大启发，这又一次证实了：作者只有深入到实际斗争生活中去，站稳了革命的立场，才能理解英雄模范人物的真实的思想感情，也才能够正确地塑造出他们的英雄形象。
    最后，从这些优秀的通讯报告中，也证明了通讯报告这一文学形式是有力的形式，值得大大提倡。当前我们国家各方面的建设工作，都在飞跃地进展；在朝鲜前线正进行着伟大的反侵略战争，新的英雄模范人物不断地涌现和成长。为了及时反映祖国的伟大现实生活，把先进的东西迅速传播开去，成为领导和鼓舞人民的力量，显然通讯报告是一种最合适的文学形式。抗美援朝运动中出现的优秀报告文学作品用事实有力地驳斥了那种认为报告文学不能深刻写人物的错误见解。在斗争中，我们的英雄人物已经不是少量的存在了，为了教育人民，我们有责任来迅速而准确地反映这些英雄人物和伟大的斗争。
