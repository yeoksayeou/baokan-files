Xinhua News Agency, 4th: The Korean People's Observation Delegation today held cordial meetings with six families of Chinese People's Volunteers in the capital. These six families are Jia Lanwen, mother of Zhao Guoqian, a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers; Li Old Lady, mother of Li Quan, a soldier who made a great contribution at Feihu Mountain; Ding Jiaju, father of Ding Yongling, a meritorious person who made a great contribution; Gao Yuzhen, wife of Qiao Xikui, a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers; Wang Yangzhen, mother of Chen Zhengyang, a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers; and Guo Dama, mother of Guo Chunzhi, a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

A group of delegation members, headed by Xuan Xun, visited Jia Lanwen, Ding Jiaju, and Guo Dama. The delegation brought fragrant flowers to the military families and expressed the utmost friendship and respect of all the Korean people to them. The military families also prepared fruits and refreshments to warmly entertain the distinguished guests.

Jia Lanwen, a member of the Communist Party, is now the director of a military family factory in the Second District of Beijing. Her son Zhao Guoqian, daughter-in-law Xu Shangqing, and nephew Ran Ping are all in Korea. Her seventeen-year-old daughter, Zhao Guomeng, a member of the Youth League, is studying in the third year of senior high school at the Affiliated Women's High School of Beijing Normal University. Xuan Xun, the head of the delegation, expressed his cordial condolences and gratitude to this glorious mother. He said: The entire Korean people thank the Chinese people for their brotherly and righteous assistance, which has laid the cornerstone for the inevitable victory of our people. The Chinese People's Volunteers are universally loved by the Korean people, and glory belongs to you. Jia Lanwen, a member of the military family, said: First of all, we should thank the Korean people for their care and help for our children. Opposing the American imperialist aggression is the common responsibility of the Chinese people and the people of the world, and we should do so. Zhao Guomeng introduced to the Korean friends the high anti-American and aid-Korea enthusiasm of the students in her school. More than 1,000 students have voluntarily signed up to join the Volunteers. She said: "If the front needs it, we have countless young people ready to join the forefront of the struggle!" The Korean representatives carefully noted down the addresses of this military family and the names of their relatives at the front. Jia Lanwen also showed the representatives a letter written by Zhao Guoqian from home.

Ding Jiaju, a member of the military family, is now a teacher at the Workers' Night School in the Eighth District. He warmly welcomed the representatives of the Korean people and said: "We are a family connected by flesh and blood. We have long fought side by side with the imperialists through thick and thin. Please tell the Volunteers that we must not let the American devils bully the Chinese and Korean people."

The delegation also visited Guo Dama, a representative of the military families in the Eighth District and a representative of the street women. The "Guo Dama Assault Team" won an award from Mayor Peng Zhen this spring for its active work and excellent results in the cleaning campaign. Her husband, Guo Laixing, works as a manager in a military family chainsaw factory. The 49-year-old Guo Dama excitedly told the representatives about their happy and joyful life today. She asked the representatives to tell her son to fight the enemy more bravely at the front and resolutely eliminate the American aggressors.

After the visit, Commander Xuan Xun excitedly said: Today, we have personally seen the determination of the families of the Volunteers and concretely contacted the incomparably powerful force of the Chinese people's anti-American and aid-Korea movement, which has further encouraged our fighting will. We must bring the will and determination of the Chinese people back to Korea and redouble our efforts to defeat the American aggressors!
