Gifts from Workers to Farmers
    ——An Introduction to the Agricultural Production Materials Hall of the North China Region Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition

    Everyone who visits the "Agricultural Production Materials Hall" of the North China Region Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition receives a concrete and vivid lesson in the worker-peasant alliance.

    The exhibits in this hall are not numerous, but they powerfully attract every farmer representative who enters. They look and look again, ask and ask again; the guides constantly answer their questions. The new-style farm tools, chemical fertilizers, and agricultural machinery manufactured by the working class for the farmers arouse deep interest among the farmers.

    There is an old Chinese proverb that says, "A thousand acres of good land are reaped by one plow." For thousands of years before liberation, Chinese farmers had been using clumsy old-fashioned plows, harrows, drills, hoes, and other farm tools. From the Qin and Han dynasties to the time of liberation, the improvement of farm tools in our country was really too slow. Under the bone-scraping exploitation of successive ruling classes, the peasants not only had no power to improve production tools and production techniques, but even the primitive farm tools were far from sufficient. According to the 1950 statistics, compared with the country's arable land, farmers still lacked 31 percent of the farm tools they needed. Several clumsy old-style farm tools displayed in the exhibition hall are one of the material evidences of the crimes of the reactionary ruling classes.

    After liberation, farmers urgently demanded improved farm tools in order to increase production. The productive forces of the countryside were liberated, and farmers also had the power to improve farm tools. Next to the old-style farm tools displayed in the Agricultural Production Materials Hall are the fruits of the wisdom of Shanxi farmers: eight kinds of improved "weeding hoes," with working efficiency two, three, and up to a dozen times higher than the old-style "hand hoes"; six kinds of improved drills, which improved the quality and efficiency of sowing. These facts show that farmers urgently need to be liberated from year-round heavy physical labor. This demand of farmers would be impossible without the help of workers.

    In this exhibition hall, farmer representatives are all crowding around the new-style farm tools produced by the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory. Here is displayed a set of new-style plows suitable for various soil types; harrows that can adjust the depth; four-row seeders that can adjust the depth and row spacing, save half the labor compared to the old drills, and double the efficiency; a three-pronged lightweight weeding hoe that increases work efficiency by nearly 20 times; and a small animal-powered harvester that can harvest 60 to 80 mu of grain per day with two animals, that is, about 30 times more efficient than hand sickles. The guide, pointing to a model of the new plow in operation, said: "The new plow has the most advantages: it plows thoroughly and covers the grass tightly; it crushes the soil thoroughly and leaves no clods; the ground is level and leaves no ditches; it is efficient and light to pull; and it is strong and durable." Farmer representatives who have used the new plow nod frequently, proving the guide's words. In addition to farm machinery for field cultivation, the exhibition hall also has many farm product processing machines that farmers like, such as corn threshers, rice threshers, straw cutters, and sweet potato slicers. These machines can increase work efficiency by three, five, or eight times. In addition, various waterwheels suitable for current use are also displayed.

    Another important exhibit in the exhibition hall is fertilizer. Here are various oil cakes and chemical fertilizers made in our country—ammonium sulfate and superphosphate. These highly effective fertilizers have been gradually adopted by farmers. This year, the fertilizers supplied to farmers by cooperatives in various provinces of North China can increase grain production by more than 4.2 million tons. Chemical fertilizers provide the most favorable conditions for increasing the yield per unit area of farmland. Therefore, the cartoon strips explaining how to use chemical fertilizers have become the focus of farmers' inquiries.

    Another part of the exhibits in the exhibition hall are various agricultural sprayers: sprayers, dusters, cotton aphid soap, 666, DDT, Bordeaux mixture, copper sulfate, Wang Copper, and so on. These pesticides and machinery for fighting crop diseases and insect pests have become powerful assistants to farmers' production. It is estimated that North China will need to increase the production of agricultural pesticides and machinery by more than three times next year to meet the needs of farmers.

    These machines manufactured by our country's workers for farmers will exert a huge material force on agricultural production. If new-style plows were used completely in the rural areas of North China, it could increase grain production by 1.4 billion catties each year and save 10 million laborers. What an astonishing number! Farmers know what kind of happiness workers will help them create. A farmer representative from Hebei, looking at a tractor made by the Shanxi Machinery General Factory, said: "It is really envious to see these things. When will the worker brothers be able to manufacture them in large quantities and supply them to us? At that time, we farmers will be completely liberated." The farmers of the new China are currently struggling for patriotic high yields. In the future, they will fight for agricultural mechanization under the leadership of the working class.

    工人给予农民的礼物
    ——华北区城乡物资交流展览会农业生产资料馆介绍
    每一个参观了华北区城乡物资交流展览会的“农业生产资料馆”的人，都能受到一课具体生动的工农联盟的教育。
    这个展览馆里陈列的展品并不多，但是最有力地吸引住每一个走进馆内的农民代表。他们在馆内看了又看，问了又问；讲解员不停地回答他们提出的问题。工人阶级为农民制造的新式农具、化学肥料和农用药械，引起农民深厚的兴趣。
    中国有一句古老的农谚，叫作“千顷好地，收在一犁”。在解放前数千年间，我国农民一直使用着笨拙的旧式犁、耙、耧、锄等农具。秦汉以后到解放以前，我国农具的改进实在太慢了。农民在历代统治阶级敲骨及髓的剥削下，不但没有力量改进生产工具和生产技术，就连原始的农具，也是远不够用的。据一九五○年的统计，与全国耕地比较，农民现有的农具还缺少百分之三十一。几种笨拙的旧式农具陈列在展览馆里，正是反动统治阶级罪恶的物证之一。
    解放后的农民，为了增加生产，迫切要求改进农具。农村的生产力获得解放，农民也有了力量来改进农具。农业生产资料馆陈列的旧式农具旁边，展览着山西农民智慧的创造：八种改良的“耘锄”，工作效率高于旧式“手锄”的两倍、三倍、到十数倍；六种改良耧，提高了播种的质量和效率。这些事实，说明农民们十分需要从终年烦重的体力劳动中解放出来，农民这种要求，如果没有工人的帮助，是不可能的。
    在这个展览馆中，农民代表都拥在华北农业机械总厂出品的新式农具之前。这里陈列着一套适合各种土质的新式犁；可以调节深浅的耙；可以调节深浅、行距，比旧耧节省一半人工，提高一倍效率的四行播种机；提高工作效率近二十倍的三齿轻便耘锄；以及两个牲口一天可以收割六十亩到八十亩谷物，即，比手镰效率提高约三十倍的小型畜力收割机。讲解员指着新犁耕作的模型说：“新犁好处最多：翻土彻底盖草严；碎土到家不留坷垃；地面平整不留沟埂；效率高拉力轻；又坚固又耐用。”使用过新犁的农民代表们频频点头，证明讲解员的话。展览馆中，除了农田耕作的机械外，还有很多农民喜用的农产品加工器械，如玉米脱粒机，打稻机，铡草机，甘薯切片机等。这些机械，可提高工作效率三倍、五倍、到八倍。此外，还陈列着各种适合目前使用的水车。
    展览馆中，另一部分重要展品是肥料。这儿有各种油饼和我国自制的化学肥料——硫酸铵和过磷酸钙。这些肥效极高的肥料，已渐为农民所采用。今年华北各省由合作社供给农民的肥料，可使粮食增产四百二十余万吨。化学肥料给农田提高单位面积产量提供了最有利的条件。因此，说明使用化学肥料的方法的连环画，成了农民询问的中心。
    展览馆里的另一部分展品是各种各样的农用药械：喷雾器、喷粉器、棉蚜皂、六六六、滴滴涕、波尔多、硫酸铜、王铜，等等。这些战胜农作物病虫害的药械，已成为农民们生产的有力助手。据估计，明年华北需要增加三倍多农用药械生产量，才能满足农民的要求。
    我国工人给农民制造的这些器械，将在农业生产上发挥巨大的物质力量。如果华北农村完全使用新式犁，每年可以增产十四亿斤粮食，节省一千万个劳动力。这是一个多么惊人的数字！农民知道工人会帮助他们创造怎样的幸福，一个河北农民代表看着山西机械总厂自制的一部拖拉机说：“看着这些东西真眼热，什么时候工人兄弟能够大量制造出来，供给我们用呢？那时候，我们农民就完完全全的大解放了。”新中国的农民，目前正为爱国丰产而奋斗，将来，他们是会在工人阶级领导下，为农业机械化而奋斗的。
