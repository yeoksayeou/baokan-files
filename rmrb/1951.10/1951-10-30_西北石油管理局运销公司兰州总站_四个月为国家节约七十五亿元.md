    Northwest Petroleum Administration Transportation and Marketing Company, Lanzhou Terminal
    Saves 7.5 Billion Yuan for the Country in Four Months
    Since the workers of the Lanzhou Terminal of the Northwest Petroleum Administration Transportation and Marketing Company launched the increase production and practice economy movement in May of this year, they have saved the country over 7.51 billion yuan in just four months.
    In March of this year, when the Northwest Petroleum Administration Transportation and Marketing Company inspected the work of the Lanzhou Terminal, it found that the terminal had many accidents during transportation, large losses, and serious waste. Last year, there were 26 car accidents, and tires could only travel an average of just over 9,000 kilometers, while the amount of bonuses issued was almost twice the total annual salary. In response to these shortcomings, the station launched an increase production and practice economy movement among its employees from May onwards. Each team and each employee formulated plans to increase production and practice economy and competed with each other. Teams and brigades also formulated patriotic pacts for increasing production and practicing economy. The station abolished the gasoline saving reward system (because simply rewarding gasoline saving was prone to accidents) and implemented a tire saving and safe driving reward system, stipulating tire quotas, fuel consumption quotas, and setting safe mileage driving speed standards. After the start of the increase production and practice economy movement, the station's transportation volume increased month by month, from 2.07 million ton-kilometers in May to 3.4 million ton-kilometers in September. Under the principle of driving safety, each vehicle was increased from the original four and a half tons to five and a half tons, and the number of empty oil drums loaded was increased from 80 to 150. The greatest savings were in tires, with 128 tires saved in July and August alone. In order to extend the life of the tires, the workers came up with many methods, such as implementing "three stops and four checks," that is, stopping every 30 kilometers to check, checking when crossing sidewalks, checking in the morning and evening, and checking frequently. Some people regularly measured tire pressure, changed tire positions (because the road surface was uneven and the tire load was different), and avoided emergency braking, so that the average tire mileage increased from 9,000 kilometers to 28,000 kilometers. In order to reduce the occurrence of steel plate breakage, they paid attention to not twisting the car when driving, and some workers padded the steel plates with rubber. In the past, an average of one piece was broken every 5,000 kilometers, but now it has been reduced to an average of one piece every 9,000 kilometers. In addition, the station also saved more than 130,000 liters of gasoline and more than 2,000 catties of engine oil in four months. The safe driving mileage has also been increased from 30,000 kilometers to 36,000 kilometers. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西北石油管理局运销公司兰州总站
    四个月为国家节约七十五亿元
    西北石油管理局运销公司兰州总站职工在今年五月间开展增产节约运动以来，四个月内即为国家节省了七十五亿一千余万元。
    今年三月，西北石油管理局运销公司在检查兰州总站的工作时，发现该站在运输中肇事多损失大，浪费现象很严重。去年一年，汽车肇事事件达二十六起，轮胎平均只能行驶九千多公里，而所发的奖金额却几等于全年工资两倍。针对这些缺点，该站从五月份起即发动职工展开增产节约运动，各分队以及每个职工都订了增产节约计划，相互进行竞赛。分队和大队还订立了增产节约的爱国公约。全站废除了节约汽油奖励制度（因单纯奖励节省汽油，容易发生事故），实行节省轮胎和安全行车奖励制度，规定了轮胎定额、耗油定量，并订定安全里程行车速度标准。在增产节约运动开始以后，该站的运输量即逐月增加，五月份行车二百零七万吨公里，九月份便增至三百四十万吨公里。在行车安全的原则下，每部车由原装四吨半增至五吨半，装空油桶由八十个增到一百五十个。节约成绩最大的是轮胎，仅七、八两月即节省了一百二十八条。为了延长轮胎的寿命，工人们想出许多方法，如实行了“三停四查”，即每行三十公里停车检查一次，过便道检查，早晚检查和经常检查。有的经常测量轮胎气压，调换轮胎位置（因路面不平轮胎负荷不同），不紧急刹车等，这样使轮胎平均由行驶九千公里增至两万八千公里。为了减少钢板折断的情形，开车时注意不使车扭动，有的工人在钢板上垫胶皮。过去平均五千公里折断一片，现在减至平均九千公里断一片。此外，该站在四个月内还节省了汽油十三万余公升，机油二千多斤。安全行车里程亦由三万公里提高到三万六千公里。    （新华社）
