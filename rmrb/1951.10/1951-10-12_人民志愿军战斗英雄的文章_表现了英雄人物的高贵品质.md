    Articles on Combat Heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Demonstrate the Noble Qualities of Heroic Figures
    To the Editor:
    I have read every word of the articles about the combat heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army that have been serialized on the fourth page of the People's Daily since October 4th. The lines are filled with the atmosphere of battle and the spirit of heroic tenacity. Comrade Chen Desheng persisted in fighting while wounded and refused to leave the front line. When he could no longer use his hands, he used his tongue to pull the pin of the grenade, finally destroying the enemy's tank. Nurse Jiang Shuhua, under enemy bombing and strafing, rescued fifteen wounded soldiers in one breath, sacrificing her own life. Comrade Yang Lian’di regarded railway equipment as more important than his own life, stubbornly carrying out sacred combat missions on the Korean front.
    I understand that heroic figures are not some kind of "three-headed, six-armed" beings; they look the same as ordinary people. The difference is that they have noble qualities, infinite loyalty to the people, and unparalleled hatred for the enemy. They have the determination to "not leave their posts in the most dangerous moments" and the spirit that "no difficulties are insurmountable in front of a Communist Party member." They deserve the glorious title of "the most beloved people."
    Heroes are my good examples and my good teachers. From today onwards, I will study hard at school and work diligently, never failing the expectations of the people of the motherland for the volunteer soldiers. I offer my highest respects to the heroes here.

### 人民志愿军战斗英雄的文章  表现了英雄人物的高贵品质

    人民志愿军战斗英雄的文章
    表现了英雄人物的高贵品质编辑同志：
    人民日报第四版从十月四日连载的中国人民志愿军战斗英雄的文章，我都一字不掉地读过了。字里行间都洋溢着战斗的气息，英勇顽强的精神。陈德生同志负伤坚持不下火线，手不能使用了，便用舌头把手榴弹的弦弄出，终于炸毁了敌人的坦克。女护士姜淑华同志，在敌机轰炸扫射下，以牺牲自己生命的精神，一口气抢救出十五个伤员。杨连第同志把铁路器材看得比自己的生命还重要，顽强地在朝鲜前线执行着神圣的战斗任务。
    我了解了英雄人物并不是什么“三头六臂”，他们也是和平常人长得一样。所不同的就是他们有高贵的品质，有对人民的无限的忠诚与对敌人的无比的憎恨。他们有的是“在最危急的关头，不离开岗位”的决心与“在共产党员面前没有克服不了的困难”的精神。他们担当得起“最可爱的人”这一个光荣的称号。
    英雄们是我的好榜样，是我的良师。从今天起，我一定在学校里好好地学习，努力工作，决不辜负志愿军同志对祖国人民的期望，我在这里向英雄们致崇高的敬礼。
