    Li Huan and Others in Guangling County Illegally Steal and Sell Timber
    Local Leading Organs Should Quickly Investigate and Handle

    Editor Comrade:
    Li Huan, a member of the Forestry Section of Guangling County, Chahar Province, and Tian Xi, a forest protection cadre, colluded with each other to steal and sell state-owned timber from Baiyangyu in the fourth district of the county for a long time. This incident has not attracted the attention of the county's leading organs. It was not until September of this year that Mu Lushi and Bai Ju, comrades from the Yingxian Office of the Yongding River Afforestation Yanbei District, were sent to Baiyangyu to inspect the mountains and forests that it was discovered. According to preliminary inspections, more than 2,000 trees have been felled. As early as 1950, Li Huan had already stolen and sold many trees in the name of the county's Bureau of Forestry and Animal Husbandry. After the Bureau of Forestry and Animal Husbandry was abolished, Li Huan and Tian Xi, who was in charge of the state-owned forest in Baiyangyu, stole and continued to sell timber using the bureau's discarded seal. For example, last year Li Huan asked Liu Wang from Xiashijiaping Village and Song Yi from Modaoping Village to cut down more than 30 state-owned birch trees and sold them for three silver dollars. This spring, Li Huan and Tian Xi stole and sold more than 300 birch trees to Yang Yucai, Wang Denglian, and other eight people from Woyangchang Village. The receipt for the payment was stamped with the discarded seal of the Bureau of Forestry and Animal Husbandry. In addition, Li and Tian arbitrarily approved the masses to cut down mountain forests and profited from them. For example, Tian Xi approved Liu Xian, Li Pei, and others from Shangmagou Village to cut down 800 state-owned trees. Some people cut down trees privately, and Li Huan took the opportunity to intimidate them and profit from them. For example, Zhang Zhen from Sanzhuangzi secretly felled more than 20 birch trees this spring and made seven plow bottoms. After Li Huan found out, he beat Zhang Zhen with a stick and threatened to send him to the county for legal action. As a result, Zhang Zhen sent him two silver dollars and sent the plow bottoms to Li Huan's home before it was over. Also, Zhang Guifu, the finance committee member of Sanzhuangzi Village, was allowed to cut down more than 120 state-owned trees in Sandaogou with a note from Tian Xi stamped with the official seal (some farmers reflected that three or four hundred trees were cut down). After Li Huan found out, he also carried out extortion. The above facts are only part of Li Huan and Tian Xi's embezzlement and sale of state-owned timber.

    In addition to Li and Tian's embezzlement and sale of state-owned timber, some district governments do not pay enough attention to state-owned forests. For example, when Qiaotou Village in the fourth district of Guangling County built a school building, District Chief Song Ming approved the felling of state-owned forests without reporting to the higher authorities. Li Guiren, the female village chief of Guojiaquan Village in the district, asked to cut down trees due to financial difficulties, and the district chief wrote a letter of introduction to apply to the county. As a result, Li Guiren did not take the letter to the county. When she returned to the village, she felled state-owned timber and said it had been approved. Later, the villagers also followed suit and cut down a total of five or six hundred trees.

    For the above-mentioned incidents of damage to state-owned forests, we hope that the leading organs of Guangling County will quickly and earnestly investigate and deal with them.

    广灵县李环等违法盗卖林木
    当地领导机关应速检查处理编辑同志：
    察哈尔省广灵县林业科科员李环和护林干部田喜互相勾结，长期盗卖该县四区白羊峪国有林木材。这一事件一直未引起该县领导机关的注意，直到今年九月，永定河造林雁北区应县办事处派穆屡仕、白举二同志到白羊峪检查山林，才被发现。据初步检查被砍伐的林木有二千余棵。一九五○年，李环就已盗用该县林牧局的名义盗卖了许多树木；林牧局机构取消后，李环即和看管白羊峪国有林的田喜窃用该局废章继续盗卖林木。如去年李环叫下石家坪村刘旺和磨刀坪村宋义砍国有桦树三十余棵，卖得三块白洋。今春李环、田喜盗卖桦树三百余棵给卧羊场村的杨育才、王登连等八人，价款收条上盖林牧局废章。此外，李、田两人擅自批准群众砍伐山林，并从中取利。如田喜批准上麻沟村刘贤、李培等砍国有林木八百棵。有些群众私自砍伐，李环就乘机威吓，从中取利。如三庄子张真今春偷伐了二十余棵桦树做了七付犁底，李环查知后，用棍子打了张真，并声言要送县法办，结果张真送了他两块白洋，又把犁底送到李环家中才算没事。又三庄子村财政委员张贵福经田喜开条子盖公章准许砍三道沟国有林一百二十多棵（有的农民反映是砍了三、四百棵），李环知道后，也进行了敲诈。以上事实只是李环、田喜盗卖行为的一部分。
    除李、田二人的贪污盗卖国有林木而外，有的区政府对国有林也不够重视。如广灵四区桥头村盖校舍，区长宋明不报告上级就擅自批准砍伐国有林。该区郭家圈女村长李桂仁因生活困难要求砍树，区长就写信介绍向县申请。结果李桂仁并未持信去县，回村就砍伐国有林木，并说已经批准。后来该村群众也跟着砍伐，共砍树五、六百棵。
    以上各项破坏国有林的事件，我们希望广灵县领导机关迅速认真检查处理。
