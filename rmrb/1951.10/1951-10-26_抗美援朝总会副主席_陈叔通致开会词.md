    Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the China Peace Committee, Delivers Opening Address

    Today is the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Resistance Against U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Today's meeting is to celebrate the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Resistance Against U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

    First of all, on behalf of the people of the whole country, I would like to pay the highest respect to the glorious and invincible Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army.

    It has been a year since the Chinese people launched the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea movement and the Chinese People's Volunteers went abroad to fight. The people of the whole country are enthusiastically celebrating the great victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fighting side by side on the Korean battlefield against the invading army of U.S. imperialism. The broad masses of peace-loving people all over the world have also strengthened their confidence in defending world peace and opposing imperialist aggression.

    In the past year, the incomparably brave Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have defeated the invading army of the most powerful imperialism in the world today—U.S. imperialism, and defeated the invading army of the United Nations, so-called, of fifteen countries, including the U.S. accomplices Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Greece, Turkey, the Union of South Africa, Abyssinia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Colombia, and the puppet Syngman Rhee army of U.S. imperialism, eliminating a total of more than 380,000 invading troops, including more than 176,000 invading troops of U.S. imperialism, shooting down, damaging, and capturing 2,310 enemy planes, and driving the invading troops from the Yalu River to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, where they started their aggression. The victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the past year has helped the Korean People's Army, consolidated the security of the Chinese border, guaranteed the progress of China's domestic construction work, and greatly enhanced the international status and prestige of the People's Republic of China.

    The victory of the Chinese and Korean people's forces is not only a victory for the anti-aggression struggle of the Chinese and Korean people, but also a victory for the people of Asia and the people of the world against imperialist aggression and enslavement, and for safeguarding peace and democracy.

    The aggressive war launched by U.S. imperialism in Korea has suffered a serious blow and a shameful defeat.

    Today, as we celebrate the great victory of the first anniversary of the Resistance Against U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, we must also realize that although U.S. imperialism has been badly battered on the Korean battlefield, it has not abandoned its ambition to invade Korea and further invade Asia and dominate the world. It has continuously obstructed, delayed, and sabotaged the Korean armistice negotiations, causing the negotiations to have no results until now. Therefore, the people of the whole country must continue to strengthen the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea movement, strengthen patriotic production and conservation, and donate aircraft and artillery, so as to more effectively support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, strive for the final victory of this just war, and defend the peace of Asia and the peace of the world.

    抗美援朝总会副主席
    陈叔通致开会词
    今天是中国人民抗美援朝一周年纪念日。今天的大会，就是庆祝中国人民抗美援朝一周年纪念的大会。
    我首先代表全国人民向光荣的、英勇无敌的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军致崇高的敬意。
    中国人民自从发起了抗美援朝运动、中国人民志愿军出国作战以来，到今天已是一周年了。全国人民都在热烈庆祝中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在朝鲜战场上并肩打击美帝国主义侵略军的伟大胜利，全世界爱好和平的广大人民也都加强了保卫世界和平、反对帝国主义侵略的胜利信心。
    英勇无比的中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军，在过去一年中打败了现在世界上最强大的一个帝国主义——美帝国主义的侵略军，打败了美国帮凶英国、澳大利亚、加拿大、新西兰、法国、荷兰、比利时、卢森堡、希腊、土耳其、南非联邦、阿比西尼亚、泰国、菲律宾、哥伦比亚等十五个国家所谓联合国的侵略军及美帝国主义的傀儡李承晚军队，一共消灭了侵略军三十八万人以上，其中美帝国主义侵略军达十七万六千余人，击落击伤和缴获敌机二千三百一十架，把侵略军从鸭绿江边一直赶回到他们从那里出发进行侵略的三八线附近一带地方。中国人民志愿军一年来作战的胜利，帮助了朝鲜人民军，巩固了中国边境的安全，保障了中国国内的建设工作的进行，大大提高了中华人民共和国的国际地位和威信。
    中朝人民部队的胜利，不但是中朝人民反侵略斗争的胜利，而且是全亚洲人民、全世界人民反对帝国主义的侵略和奴役，维护和平和民主事业的胜利。
    美帝国主义在朝鲜发动的侵略战争遭到了严重的打击与可耻的失败。
    今天，在我们庆祝抗美援朝一周年伟大的胜利的时候，还必须认识到美帝国主义虽然在朝鲜战场上碰得头破血流，但他并未放弃侵略朝鲜及进一步侵略亚洲和称霸世界的野心，曾不断阻挠拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判，致使谈判直至现在还没有结果。因此，我们全国人民必须继续加强抗美援朝运动，加强爱国增产和节约，捐献飞机大炮，以便更有力地支持中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，争取这个正义战争最后胜利，来保卫亚洲的和平和世界的和平。
