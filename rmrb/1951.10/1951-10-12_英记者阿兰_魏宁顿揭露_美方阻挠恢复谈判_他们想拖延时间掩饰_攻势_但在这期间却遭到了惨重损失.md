Xinhua News Agency, 11th. London "Daily Worker" reporter Alan Winnington reported from Kaesong on the 11th: All the necessary temporary measures for resuming ceasefire negotiations were agreed upon today. Therefore, the Korean-Chinese liaison officer suggested that representatives from both sides meet at 1:00 PM tomorrow. However, the U.S. side refused to confirm the date. They re-proposed that all major issues be resolved by liaison officers rather than by the representatives themselves, thereby hindering progress. Consequently, the liaison officer meeting adjourned until tomorrow morning. Thus, due to U.S. obstruction, another two days have been wasted. As far as the Korean-Chinese side is concerned, a meeting of the delegations from both sides could have started at any time in the past three weeks, but it has still not been arranged. During this period, in Ridgway's now-acknowledgedly crushed "Autumn Offensive," they have paid a heavy price on the front lines, especially the British Commonwealth Division. In these already bitterly cold mountains, the corpses of British and other troops are still wearing thin summer uniforms, while the Korean-Chinese forces already have winter equipment. Although I do not yet have exact figures for British losses, I can disclose that from September 30th to October 6th, of the 13,000 United Nations troops killed, wounded, or captured, more than 9,000 were on the Western Front – the center of the offensive. There are few South Korean troops on the Western Front, so these losses must be largely American and British troops. They suffered such heavy losses because the Korean-Chinese forces fought with amazing perseverance and courage, and their firepower was powerful and accurate. The United States has insisted on delaying negotiations for fifty days now. If Ridgway and Van Fleet had not attempted to use the negotiations to cover up their offensive in order to advance further into North Korea, all these losses could have been avoided. Since the Korean-Chinese side repeatedly proposed the immediate resumption of negotiations, which was repeatedly rejected by the U.S. side, the British army has suffered very heavy losses.

    英记者阿兰·魏宁顿揭露
    美方阻挠恢复谈判
    他们想拖延时间掩饰“攻势”
    但在这期间却遭到了惨重损失
    【新华社十一日讯】据伦敦工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿十一日自开城报道：一切有关恢复停火谈判的必要临时办法今日都获致了协议，因此朝中联络官建议双方代表在明日下午一时开会。但是美方却拒绝确定日期，他们重新提出一切主要问题由联络官一级而不是由代表们来解决的要求，这样来阻挠进展。因此，联络官会议休会至明日上午再开。这样，由于美国的阻挠，又浪费了两天时间。就朝中方面而论，双方代表团的会议在过去三周中本来随时都可以开始，但现在仍未安排好。在这一期间，在李奇微的现在已公认为被粉碎了的“秋季攻势”中，他们已在前线付出了重大的代价，尤其是英联邦师。在这已经是严寒的山地，英军及其他军队的尸体穿的仍是薄薄的夏装，而朝中部队却已有了冬季装备了。我虽然还没有英军损失的确切数字，但我可以披露，自九月三十日到十月六日，联合国军被毙、伤、俘的一万三千名，其中有九千多人是在西线——攻势的中心。西线很少南朝鲜军，这些损失一定大部分是美英军队的。其所以遭受这样严重的损失，是因为朝中部队以惊人的毅力和勇气作战，朝中部队火力强大而准确。美国坚持拖延谈判到今天已有五十天，如果不是李奇微和范佛里特企图利用谈判来掩饰其攻势，以便在北朝鲜更向前推进，这一切损失原是可以避免的。自从朝中方面一再提出立即恢复谈判的建议而为美方多次拒绝以来，英军遭受了非常重大的损失。
