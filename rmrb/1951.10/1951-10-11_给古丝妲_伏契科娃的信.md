    Letter to Comrade Gusta Fučíková
    (1) Respected Comrade Gusta Fučíková:
    When we read in the People's Daily that you had arrived in the capital of our great motherland—Beijing, we were extremely happy. Although we have never met you, your name is already familiar to us. Because we have read the immortal work you edited—"Report Written Under the Gallows," and from this book, we have come to know Comrade Julius Fučík, you, and many other heroic fighters in the anti-fascist struggle. We express our infinite respect for you, who have always stood at the forefront of the anti-fascist struggle, and at the same time, we extend to you our lofty revolutionary salute!
    We are a group of glorious youths of the Mao Zedong era, soldiers of the heroic People's Liberation Army. We are proud to be born in this happy era, and we are proud to be defenders of world peace. When reading "Report Written Under the Gallows," we were inspired by Comrade Julius Fučík's revolutionary optimism. His deeds have increased our confidence in the inevitable victory of the communist cause. "I love life, and I fight for it." Julius Fučík's words constantly inspire us to move forward. He will forever live in our hearts and be immortal. We must also tell you that "Report Written Under the Gallows" is one of our favorite books. We love it as much as we love "How the Steel Was Tempered." We love Comrade Julius Fučík as much as we love the Soviet Paul Korchagin. They are both our most respected heroes, and their revolutionary optimism and fearless spirit in struggle have become the best example for us to learn from!
    Respected Comrade Gusta Fučíková, we are all comrades-in-arms standing on the same front. Let the people of our two countries, China and Czechoslovakia, unite even more closely in the struggle against imperialism and in defense of world peace!
    With revolutionary greetings! Soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

    (2) Dear Comrade Gusta Fučíková:
    We were so happy to hear that you have come to Beijing to participate in our National Day celebrations. We have known you from books and news reports. Now that you have come to China, you will see us building our happy life in the new society.
    For us Chinese youth, Julius Fučík—your lover and comrade-in-arms—is not only a writer and a journalist, but also a warrior for truth. His name symbolizes struggle and victory. When I first read "Report Written Under the Gallows," this immortal work, I was truly moved. I want to learn Julius Fučík's love for the people and his spirit of unyielding struggle for the truth, even to the point of death. At the same time, in this book, we know that you are Julius Fučík's closest comrade and comrade-in-arms. You have the same strong will as him, and we Chinese youth want to learn from you. Respected Comrade Gusta Fučíková, please convey our respects to the youth of Czechoslovakia. We often think of them.
    With high respect!

    给古丝妲·伏契科娃的信
    （一）敬爱的古丝妲·伏契科娃同志：
    当我们从人民日报上读到你来到我们伟大祖国的首都——北京的消息，我们感到异常的高兴。虽然我们没有见过你，但是你的名字已为我们所熟悉。因为我们读过了你所编辑的不朽著作——“绞索套着脖子时的报告”，并从这本书中认识了尤利斯·伏契克同志和你以及其他许多反法西斯斗争中的英勇战士们。我们对于一直站在反法西斯斗争最前线的你，表示无限的敬意，同时向你致以崇高的革命敬礼！
    我们是一群光荣的毛泽东时代的青年、英雄的人民解放军的战士。我们以自己能生长在这个幸福的时代而骄傲，以自己能作为世界和平的保卫者而自豪。在读到“绞索套着脖子时的报告”时，我们为尤利斯·伏契克同志的革命的乐观主义精神所鼓舞。他的事迹增加了我们对共产主义事业必然胜利的信心。“我爱生活，并且为它而战斗。”尤利斯·伏契克的这句话，时刻在鼓舞着我们前进。他将永远活在我们的心里而永垂不朽。还要告诉你的，就是“绞索套着脖子时的报告”是我们最喜欢的读物之一。我们热爱它就像热爱“钢铁是怎样炼成的”一样。我们热爱尤利斯·伏契克同志正如热爱苏联的保尔·柯察金一样。他们都是我们最敬爱的英雄，他们的革命乐观主义与斗争中无畏的精神，已成为我们学习的最好榜样！
    敬爱的古丝妲·伏契科娃同志，我们都是站在同一条阵线上的战友。让我们中捷两国人民在反对帝国主义，保卫世界和平的斗争中团结得更紧吧！
    致以革命敬礼！中国人民解放军战士

    （二）亲爱的古丝妲·伏契科娃同志：
    听到你来北京参加我们国庆典礼的消息，我们真是高兴。我们曾经在书本上、新闻记载中认识了你。现在，你来到我们中国，你将看到我们在新社会中建设着自己的幸福生活。
    对我们中国的青年来说，尤利斯·伏契克——你的爱人和战友，不仅是一个作家、一个新闻工作者，而且是真理的战士。他的名字象征着斗争和胜利。在我第一次阅读“绞索套着脖子时的报告”这本不朽的著作时，我真是激动。我要学习尤利斯·伏契克对人民的热爱，和为真理斗争的宁死不屈的精神。同时，在这一本书里，我们知道你是尤利斯·伏契克最亲密的同志和战友。你有着和他一样坚强的意志，我们中国青年要向你学习。敬爱的古丝妲·伏契科娃同志，请代我们向捷克斯洛伐克青年致敬。我们是经常地想念着他们的。致以崇高的敬礼！
