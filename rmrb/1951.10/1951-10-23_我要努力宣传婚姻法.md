    I Will Work Hard to Promote the Marriage Law
    To the Editor:
    After reading the Central People's Government Government Administration Council's instructions on inspecting the implementation of the Marriage Law, published in the People's Daily on September 29th, I was shocked to learn that in the Central and Southern China region alone, over 10,000 women had been murdered or committed suicide in just over a year. This alarming figure deserves the special attention of us comrades working in women's affairs.
    I work in women's labor affairs. I am ashamed that I have not seriously studied the Marriage Law myself, and therefore have not been able to comprehensively and deeply explain the principles of the Marriage Law to the female workers; moreover, I have underestimated the deep-rooted feudal ideology and have not carried out patient propaganda and education work based on the ideological situation of male and female workers.
    The female worker committee members often report to me that some female workers, due to the influence of the old society, have incorrect understandings of marriage issues. For example, some female workers in the Tonglihe Thread Factory in our district have a dependent mentality towards men. In addition, many female workers have concerns about free love, fearing ridicule from workers in the factory and interference from their families. For example, when female worker An Shuying fell in love with a male worker, her mother found out and considered it "a disgrace to the family," threatening to sever their mother-daughter relationship, and the workers in the factory also jeered.
    In the past, I always felt that these situations were inevitable during the transition period and did not pay attention to them. In the future, I will study the Marriage Law carefully, patiently promote the Marriage Law, so that female workers truly understand the spirit of the Marriage Law and implement it.

### 我要努力宣传婚姻法

专栏：读者来信

    我要努力宣传婚姻法编辑同志：
    读了九月二十九日人民日报发表的中央人民政府政务院关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示后，使我十分惊讶的，是中南区一年多来被害或自杀的妇女就有一万多人。这个惊人的数字，是值得我们作妇女工作的同志特别注意的。
    我是一个作女工工作的。我很惭愧，我自己因为没有认真地学习婚姻法，所以也就不能向女工们全面地和深入地讲解婚姻法的道理；而对根深蒂固的封建思想又认识不足，没有根据男女职工的思想情况，进行耐心的宣传教育工作。
    女工委员们经常向我反应，某些女工，由于旧社会的影响，对婚姻问题，有着不正确的认识。如我区同立合线厂有些女工，对男子有依赖思想。另外还有不少女工对自由恋爱有着顾虑，怕本厂工人笑话，又怕家庭干涉。例如女工安淑英和一个男工恋爱，被她母亲知道后，认为“给家里丢了丑”，要和她脱离母女关系，同时本厂工人也起哄。
    过去我总觉得这些情况是过渡时期所不可免的，而没有重视。今后，我要好好地学习婚姻法，耐心地宣传婚姻法，使女工们确实了解婚姻法的精神，并执行起来。
