    The Government Administration Council's Decision on Reforming the Education System Inspires the Laboring People's Enthusiasm for Learning
    To the Editor:
    On the 3rd of this month, the Government Administration Council announced the decision on reforming the education system. This decision puts worker-peasant education in its proper place, which is completely in line with the current situation and needs of the motherland.
    In old China, the working masses had no economic security, no political freedom or rights, and it was impossible to enter school to receive education. Workers and peasants were ridiculed as "both poor and ignorant." The true creators of social wealth were rejected outside the school gates! Now that the revolution has been victorious, the people have taken control of the government, and workers and peasants have not only turned over politically and economically, but also culturally.
    Comrades who serve worker-peasant education understand the working comrades' urgent desire to learn. When the worker-peasant fast-track middle school attached to Peking University held entrance exams, some worker-peasant comrades felt very sad when they talked about their inability to better complete their work tasks due to their low education level. They said, "Everyone wants to work more and better to repay the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for their cultivation, but some of the old methods are no longer applicable; if we don't step up our learning and master cultural and scientific knowledge, how can we build our motherland?" The newly announced education system has opened up broad prospects for working people to learn cultural and scientific knowledge. This should be a very powerful encouragement to them.
    Our country is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. Chairman Mao pointed out in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "These two classes account for 80 to 90 percent of China's population. The overthrow of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries mainly relied on the strength of these two classes. The transition from New Democracy to Socialism mainly relies on the alliance of these two classes." Therefore, developing worker-peasant education, defining the status of worker-peasant education in the education system, and vigorously cultivating worker-peasant intellectuals so that workers and peasants can better build their own country is an important step in consolidating and strengthening the people's democratic dictatorship, and it is also the most reliable guarantee for building a great motherland.

### 政务院关于改革学制的决定鼓舞了劳动人民的学习积极性

    政务院关于改革学制的决定鼓舞了劳动人民的学习积极性编辑同志：
    本月三日，政务院公布了关于学制改革的决定。这一决定把工农教育提到应有的地位，这是完全切合祖国目前情况和需要的。
    在旧中国，工农大众在经济上毫无保障，在政治上毫无自由和权利，入学校受教育是不可能的事。工农被讥为“既贫且愚”。真正的社会财富的创造者，倒被摈弃在学校大门之外！现在革命胜利了，人民掌握了政权，工农不但在政治上、经济上翻了身，而且在文化上也翻身了。
    为工农教育服务的同志，对工农同志迫切要求学习的心情是理解的。在北京大学附设工农速成中学举行入学考试时，有的工农同志谈到自己因文化低而不能更好地完成工作任务时，感觉很难过。他们说：“谁也想更多更好地工作，来回答共产党和毛主席的培养，可是过去的一套老办法有的现在已不适用了；如果不加紧学习，不掌握文化、科学知识，怎能建设我们的祖国呢？”现在公布的新学制给劳动人民开辟了学习文化科学知识的广阔前途。这对他们该是一个很有力的鼓励。
    我们的国家是以工人阶级为领导，工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家。毛主席在“论人民民主专政”中指出：“这两个阶级占了中国人口的百分之八十到九十。推翻帝国主义与国民党反动派，主要是这两个阶级的力量。由新民主主义到社会主义，主要依靠这两个阶级的联盟。”因此，开展工农教育，确定工农教育在学制中的地位，大力培养工农知识分子，使工农能更好地建设自己的国家，乃是巩固和加强人民民主专政的重要步骤，也是建设伟大祖国最可靠的保证。
