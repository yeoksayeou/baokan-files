    Tempered Under the Heat of the Hammer
    Gong Yeya
    I am a housewife nearing fifty years old. On May 17th of this year, I joined the Southwest Land Reform Work Group of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (99 people) and went to work in the Southwest from Beijing. After studying in Chongqing for half a month, I set off with the Eastern Sichuan team to work in Hechuan County. It wasn't until the peasant victory rally on August 17th that we left the countryside amidst the peasants' joyful atmosphere.
    In the past two and a half months, I have received profound education in a series of fierce struggles. Under the heat of the hammer, I have gradually established a firm class stand and strengthened my mass perspective.
    I remember the poor and lower-middle peasant representatives of the 11th Village of Yunmen Township, who once discussed the topic of "Who Should Be the Masters of the House" at a group meeting. The main purpose of the discussion was to implement the general line of the land reform policy. The meeting lasted for four hours, and the peasant masses spoke enthusiastically, giving full play to the spirit of democracy. During the discussion, I realized that the wisdom of the peasants is astonishing and their thinking is advancing by leaps and bounds. At the beginning of the discussion, the peasants' thinking was rather vague. When the question of "Who Should Be the Masters of the House" was raised, some people said, "The working comrades from Beijing should be the masters of the house. The comrades from Beijing are from Chairman Mao's side and can intimidate the landlords." But after repeated discussions, some people came forward to criticize this idea and proposed that the middle peasants should be the masters of the house because the middle peasants can write and do calculations and are very good at farming. After discussion after discussion, some people came out to criticize this view again, because the middle peasants were not resolute enough in the struggle. Their discussion was deepening step by step, and their thinking was improving step by step. As a result, everyone believed that land reform should only rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants. They said, "The land reform movement is like a war between the peasants and the landlords. The poor and lower-middle peasants must be the vanguard, the middle peasants help transport ammunition, and the rich peasants should not side with the enemy and concentrate on production." Isn't this conclusion in line with the general line of the land reform policy: "Rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, unite the middle peasants, neutralize the rich peasants, and eliminate the landlord class"? Therefore, when we explained the policy, the masses not only consciously and willingly participated in the discussion, but also felt that this policy was basically put forward by themselves.
    In this stage of mobilizing the masses and conveying the policy, we all followed the mass line, mobilizing the masses from point to surface. Holding big meetings for discussion, small group discussions, pouring out grievances, and talking about liberation, step by step, gradually raised the class consciousness and political consciousness of the masses. When the time was ripe, a peasant representative assembly was convened, and ten common action programs were formulated and implemented by all the representatives. The content of this program was all written based on the masses' own words. For example: "Open a poor and lower-middle peasants association, pour out grievances, dig out the roots of poverty, talk about land reform, talk about liberation," "Farmers all over the world are one family, unite and the strength is great," "Rectify the peasant association well, and the poor and lower-middle peasants will lead," "Reason with them, speak according to the law, overthrow the local tyrants, shoot the birds that stick their heads out, capture the ringleader first," and so on. These words are all vivid, simple, and clear, representing the demands of the masses and showing the strength of the masses. I took a solid big class from these jobs. I have come to realize the truth of what it means to "come from the masses, go to the masses, concentrate them, and persevere." I also realized that only by implementing the revolutionary line of letting go of mobilizing the masses, organizing the masses, and relying on the masses can the policy be fully implemented and realized.
    Chairman Mao said, "The masses are the real heroes." The facts have proved to us that this is absolutely true.
    The lives of the peasants in the Southwest were extremely painful. The broad masses of peasants were indeed squeezed into "dried-up people" by the landlord class. Before land reform, the landlord class was extremely arrogant. They bought over unemployed ruffians, organized "assassination groups" and "Ninth Route Armies," poisoned, set fires, murdered working personnel, and spread rumors to threaten the peasants, attempting to sabotage land reform. They said to the peasants, "If you oppose me, I will send you to see the King of Hell right away!" These words fully demonstrate the hideous and ugly faces and reactionary essence of the landlord class. But it is precisely because the feudal forces are so fierce and cruel to the peasants that the peasants' resistance and revolutionary nature are particularly strong. Especially the women, once they are awakened, they will swiftly and unusually erupt the anger and hatred accumulated for thousands of years, buried in their hearts, like a storm. They showed amazing strength in struggle meetings, grievance meetings, and other work.
    When the 11th Village of Yunmen Township held a women's grievance meeting, a 74-year-old Grandma Liu – her hair and teeth had all fallen out, and her eyes were completely blind – insisted that her granddaughter lead her to the meeting. She said, "This is a once-in-a-millennium event to turn over, even if it is a hundred li away, I, this old suffering woman, will crawl there!" When she arrived at the meeting place, she immediately asked loudly, "Where is the elder sister from Beijing?" I went to her side. She stretched out her dry and trembling hands and touched me from my head to my face, to my body, and to my hands. She held my hand tightly and then said to me kindly, "Elder sister, you were sent by Chairman Mao to help the 'dried-up people' turn over, right? I have suffered too much, I have suffered so much that I can't remember anything clearly. But I clearly remember: my eyes were originally bright! Only because the landlord was too hateful, oppressing me day after day, month after month, year after year, I hid behind people and cried day after day, month after month, year after year, crying my tears dry drop by drop, and I became blind!" Just these few simple words caused all the sisters in the audience to cry out. They said, "Pay back the money debt! Pay back the blood debt!" "In the past, no one asked about the poor on the roadside, but the rich had distant relatives a thousand miles away. Now it is different, Chairman Mao has sent people to see us 'dried-up people'!" "The 'dried-up people's' butts, should sit on the 'dried-up people's' benches!" "Get rid of the roots of poverty, plant the roots of wealth, and overthrow the feudal people!" "Everyone is of one mind, and yellow earth will turn into gold!" "If the landlord class is not eliminated, the 'dried-up people' will never be able to turn over!" These words fully reflect the working people's hatred for the landlord class. They have a firm stand and rich class feelings! It is precisely because of this kind of thinking and emotion that they unite and produce an irresistible force. This power can be seen very clearly at the struggle meetings against the landlord class.
    If we don't raise the issue to the height of class and don't take the people's love as our own love and the people's hatred as our own hatred, then at the critical juncture of fierce struggle, we will show an unstable stand and feel that there is a floating and wavering nature in our own thoughts and feelings, and even think that the peasants are fighting too fiercely, or even think that this movement is "terrible." Only by understanding the blood feud between the peasants and the landlord class for thousands of years can we accept tests and receive tempering in practical struggle.
    At a certain struggle meeting, an elderly local tyrant stood in front of the masses. He had been struggling for two days and two nights, and his feet were very swollen. At that time, I felt a little pity for him and thought that he should be allowed to sit down. But when I paid attention to appreciating the anger of the peasants at the time and the stubbornness of the landlord, and then asked myself: For thousands of years, have landlords and peasants ever been on an equal footing? For thousands of years, the peasants have been hung up and exploited by the landlords, has anyone paid attention to pitying them? Today is the peasants' struggle to overthrow the landlord class, are we still pitying him and afraid that he will be wronged? Aren't I here to overthrow the feudal forces? Now when I face a fierce struggle, am I still standing in front of the peasants to lead them? Or am I standing behind them and criticizing them? Or am I standing opposite them and opposing them? I felt ashamed! I immediately strengthened my position.
    Indeed, I have been constantly practicing, recognizing, re-practicing, and re-recognizing in a series of fierce struggles, testing and tempering myself again and again. I have a firm will to struggle against the enemy, and I have the enthusiasm to unite and help progress among our own people. This understanding now vividly exists in my consciousness. It is the result of the education and enlightenment given to me by the people, it is gradually cultivated from revolutionary practice, and it is eternal.
    Returning to Beijing from the Southwest, I received a gift from my son in Harbin on the same day – a study manual awarded to outstanding members of their Youth League committee. On the first page, he wrote a few words, which I was very moved to read. Now I will copy it below as my concluding remarks:
    "To celebrate your – dear mother's – victorious return, I dedicate this small book, which is of great significance to me, to you. Being an outstanding revolutionary worker is glorious and enjoyable; but isn't all glory and joy given to us by Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the people of the motherland? For all this, we should redouble our efforts to improve ourselves and strive to complete our tasks. I hope that Mom will guard against impatience and arrogance, unite the masses, cultivate genuine feelings of love for the people and love for the motherland, fight for the truth all her life, strive for peace, and dedicate everything to the revolutionary cause. And I hope that Mom will cherish the experience of this land reform practice; because this is the starting point for you to participate in the revolutionary struggle!"

    在热火大锤下锻炼
    龚业雅
    我是一个快五十岁的家庭妇女。今年五月十七日，我随全国人民政治协商会议西南土地改革工作团（九十九人）由北京到西南工作。在重庆学习了半个月。即随川东队出发赴合川县工作。直到八月十七日农民开了胜利大会，我们才在农民欢天喜地的气氛中离开乡村。
    两个半月来，我在一系列的激烈斗争实践中，得到深刻教育。在热火大锤下，我逐渐地站稳了阶级立场，并加强了群众观点。
    记得云门乡十一村的贫雇农代表，曾在一次小组会上讨论“谁来当家作主”的题目。讨论的主要目的，是为了贯彻土地改革政策的总路线。会开了四小时，农民群众踊跃发言，充分发挥了民主精神。在讨论过程中，我认识到农民的智慧是惊人的，农民的思想是突飞猛进的。讨论开始，农民的思想较模糊，当提出“谁来当家作主”时？就有人说：“要北京的工作同志来当家作主。北京同志是从毛主席身边来的，可以吓倒地主威风。”但是经过再三讨论，就有人出来批判这种思想，而提出要中农来当家作主。因为中农能写会算，对庄稼又很在行。经过讨论再讨论，又有人出来批判这种主张，因为中农在斗争中不太坚决。他们的讨论是一步一步深入，思想是一步一步提高，结果大家认为土地改革只有依靠贫雇农才对头。他们说：“土地改革运动，好比农民和地主开仗，必须要贫雇农打先锋，中农帮忙运子弹；富农不倒向敌人那一边、安心生产就好了。”这个结论，不正和土地改革政策的总路线：“依靠贫雇农，团结中农，中立富农，消灭地主阶级”相符合吗？因此，当我们交代政策时，群众不但自觉自愿地来参加讨论，而且还觉得这个政策根本就是他们自己提出来的。
    就在发动群众，传达政策的这个阶段，我们都是走群众路线，由点到面地放手发动群众。大会讨论，小组座谈，吐苦水，讲翻身，一步一步逐渐去提高群众的阶级觉悟和政治觉悟，到时机成熟了，就召开农民代表大会，制订了十项共同行动纲领，由全体代表通过实行。这个纲领内容，都是依据群众自己的话写出来的。例如：“要开贫雇会，吐苦水，挖穷根，讲土改，讲翻身”，“天下农民是一家，团结起来力量大”，“农会整顿好，贫雇做领导”，“讲理讲法，斗倒恶霸，枪打出头鸟，擒贼先擒王”等等。这些话，全是有声有色，简单明了，既代表群众要求，又显出群众力量。我从这些工作中，结结实实地上了一堂大课。我体会了什么是“从群众中来，到群众中去，集中起来，坚持下去”的真理。我也认识到只有实行放手发动群众、组织群众、依靠群众的革命路线，才能圆满地贯彻与实现政策。
    毛主席说过：“群众是真正的英雄。”事实给我们证明了：这是千真万确的。
    西南农民的生活，是非常痛苦的。广大农民确是被地主阶级挤成“干人”了。地主阶级在土地改革前，气焰十分嚣张。他们收买无业流氓，组织“暗杀团”、“九路军”，放毒、放火，谋害工作人员，还散布谣言，威胁农民，企图破坏土地改革。他们向农民说：“你反对我，我让你马上见阎王！”这种话完全表现出地主阶级狰狞丑恶的面貌和反动实质。但是正由于封建势力对农民这样凶狠残酷，所以农民的反抗性和革命性也就特别强。尤其是妇女们，一经觉悟了，她们就会迅猛异常地把几千年积累下来的、埋藏在内心的愤慨和仇恨，像狂风暴雨一样地喷发出来。她们在斗争会上、诉苦会上，以及其他工作中，都表现出惊人的力量。
    云门乡十一村举行妇女诉苦会时，一位七十四岁的刘大妈——她的头发、牙齿全脱光了，两个眼睛也全瞎了，但她一定要孙女把她牵引到会上。她说：“这是千年难逢的翻身大事，就是有一百里地远，我这苦老婆子，爬也要爬去！”她到了会场，马上高声问：“北京来的大姐在那里？”我到了她身边。她伸出干枯的颤抖的双手，把我从头上摸到脸上，摸到身上，又摸到手上。她紧紧地握住我的手，然后亲切地向我说：“大姐，你是毛主席派来帮‘干人’翻身的吧？我受的苦太多了，苦得啥子也记不清楚了。但是我清清楚楚地记得：我的眼睛本来是明亮的！只因地主太可恶了，一天天一月月一年年地压迫我，我就一天天、一月月、一年年地躲在人背后哭，一点一滴地把眼泪哭干，我就变成瞎子了！”仅仅这几句简单的话，引得全场姊妹们都哭诉起来。她们说：“钱债钱还！血债血还！”“以前是穷在路边无人问，富在千里有远亲。现在可不同了，毛主席都派人来看我们‘干人’！”“‘干人’的屁股，要坐在‘干人’的板凳上！”“去穷根，栽富根，打倒封建人！”“大家一条心，黄土变成金！”“地主阶级不消灭，干人永远翻不了身！”这些话，充分反映了劳动人民对地主阶级的仇恨。她们立场坚定，有丰富的阶级感情！正由于这种思想感情，才使她们团结起来，产生一种不可抗拒的力量。这种力量，在对地主阶级的斗争会上，是看得很清楚的。
    假如我们看问题不提高到阶级的高度来看，不能以人民的爱为自己的爱，以人民的恨为自己的恨，那么，在激烈斗争的关头上，就会表现立场不稳，感到自己的思想感情中，存在着浮浮飘飘的动摇性，甚至认为农民斗得过火，甚或认为这个运动“糟得很”。只有了解了几千年来农民对地主阶级有着不共戴天的血海深仇，然后才能在实践斗争中，接受考验，接受锻炼。
    在某一个斗争会上，一个老年的恶霸地主，站在群众面前。他已经被斗争了二天二夜，两个脚肿得很厉害。当时我心里就有点怜惜他，觉得应该让他坐。但是当我注意去体会当时农民的气愤，和地主的顽固，然后问自己：几千年来，地主和农民可曾平起平坐过没有？农民被地主吊打剥削过几千年，可有人注意过怜惜过没有？今天是农民推翻地主阶级的斗争，我们还怜惜他，怕他受委屈吗？我不是要来打倒封建势力吗？现在当我面对着激烈斗争时，我还是站在农民前面领导他们呢？还是站在他们后面指手画脚地批评他们呢？还是站在他们对面反对他们呢？我感到羞耻和惭愧！我马上坚定了我的立场。
    的确，我就是这样地在一系列的激烈的斗争中，不断地实践、认识、再实践、再认识，一次再一次地考验和锻炼。我对敌人有了坚决斗争的意志，对自己人有了团结和帮助进步的热情。这种认识，现在活生生地存在我思想意识之中，它是人民群众给与我教育和启发的结果，它是从革命实践中逐渐培养起来的，它是永恒不灭的。
    从西南回到北京，当日就接到我儿子从哈尔滨寄给我的礼物——他们团委会奖给优秀团员的一本学习手册。在第一页上，他题了几句话，我看了很受感动。现在抄录在下面，作为我的结束语：
    “为了庆祝你——亲爱的妈妈，胜利归来，将这本对我有重大意义的小册子献给你。做一个优秀的革命工作者，是光荣的，同时也是愉快的；但是一切光荣和愉快，不正是毛主席、共产党、和祖国人民赐给我们的吗？为了这一切，我们应该加倍努力提高自己，努力完成任务。希望妈妈，戒躁戒骄，团结群众，培养热爱人民、热爱祖国的真实感情，终身为真理斗争，为和平奋斗，为革命事业献出自己的一切。更愿妈妈，珍贵这次土地改革实践中的体验；因为这正是您参加革命斗争的起点！”
