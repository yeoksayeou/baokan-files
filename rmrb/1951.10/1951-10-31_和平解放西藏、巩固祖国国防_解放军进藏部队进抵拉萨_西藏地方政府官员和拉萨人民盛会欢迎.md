    Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, Consolidating National Defense
    PLA Troops Enter Lhasa
    Officials of the Tibetan Local Government and the People of Lhasa Hold a Grand Meeting to Welcome Them
    [Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 30th] People's Liberation Army troops, led by Generals Zhang Guohua and Tan Guansan, victoriously entered Lhasa on the 26th. Twenty thousand people from all walks of life in Lhasa held a grand meeting on the same day, warmly welcoming Generals Zhang and Tan and all the commanders and fighters. When the troops entered the city, important monastic and secular officials, including the Kalons of the Tibetan Local Government, went to the suburbs to set up tents to welcome them. The advance detachment of the troops entering Tibet and the Tibetan local army also lined up in the suburbs to welcome them. Central People's Government representative General Zhang Jingwu, Generals Zhang and Tan, the six Kalons of the Tibetan Local Government, and the Acting Kalon also reviewed the troops entering Tibet in the suburbs. The heroic ranks, having crossed thousands of mountains and rivers and endured the wind and snow of the plateau, were all full of spirit as they marched majestically past the reviewing stand towards the welcoming rally venue.
    The venue was surrounded by fluttering five-star red flags, beneath which hung portraits of the leaders of the Central People's Government. Below the portraits were huge banners with slogans reading: "Resolutely Implement the Peaceful Agreement, Build Tibet, and Consolidate National Defense"; "Support and Assist the Army of the People of All Nationalities of China - the Chinese People's Liberation Army"; "The Tibetan People Unite to Expel Imperialist Aggressive Forces from Tibet." Seventeen large flags bearing the Seventeen-Article Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, written in both Tibetan and Chinese, were also erected around the venue. The presidium of the meeting consisted of 31 people, including important officials of the Tibetan Local Government such as Kalon Lhalu, Ragasha, and Ngapoi, representatives of the three major monasteries, and Commander Wang Qimei of the advance detachment of the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet. Kalon Lhalu, chairman of the meeting, delivered a speech, first extending his cordial greetings to the commanders and fighters of the troops entering Tibet on behalf of people from all walks of life, and pointing out the great significance of welcoming the People's Liberation Army into Tibet to protect the Tibetan people. Next, Kalon Ngapoi, a representative of the Tibetan Local Government, spoke, thanking Central People's Government representative General Zhang Jingwu and the advance detachment of troops entering Tibet for their help and care to the Tibetan people over the past two months. He expressed his hope that the Tibetan people would unite under the leadership of the Central People's Government, resolutely implement the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, support the People's Liberation Army, drive imperialist aggressive forces out of Tibet, and consolidate national defense.
    Central People's Government representative General Zhang Jingwu spoke, first pointing out that it was of particular significance to welcome the victorious arrival of the troops entering Tibet in Lhasa, the important southwestern border region of the motherland, today, the first anniversary of the great victories in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. This is a great victory for the people of the whole country and the Tibetan people. Next, he called on the monastic and secular people of Tibet to conscientiously and thoroughly implement the agreement, support the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet, and consolidate national defense. The troops entering Tibet must carry out production to overcome all difficulties. The Tibetan local troops must unite closely with the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet, and under the unified leadership of Generals Zhang and Tan, actively complete the major task of consolidating national defense and gradually reorganize themselves into the People's Liberation Army. Finally, Representative Zhang called for strengthening national unity and internal unity in Tibet, and striving together to build a new Tibet.
    Commander of the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet, Zhang Guohua, and Political Commissar Tan Guansan both stated in their speeches that the entry of the troops and staff into Tibet was to resolutely implement the agreement, unite the monastic and secular people of Tibet, build Tibet, and consolidate national defense. Generals Zhang and Tan pointed out that although the imperialists will still carry out new conspiracies to undermine the unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities, any conspiracy of the imperialist elements will meet with new failures in front of the People's Liberation Army.
    The speakers all shouted slogans such as: "Long live the great unity of all nationalities in China," "Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of all nationalities," "May the Dalai Lama be in good health," "May the Panchen Erdeni be in good health."
    After the meeting, the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet began their magnificent and solemn entry ceremony into the city. The streets were densely packed with people, vying to see the heroes who had overcome numerous difficulties, and cheers shook the entire city.
