The National Agricultural Work Conference convened by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government concluded on September 25th, after lasting for half a month. The conference studied the experience of agricultural work in the first half of 1951 and formulated the agricultural production plan for 1952. Minister of Agriculture Li Shucheng pointed out in his concluding remarks to the conference:

(1) In February of this year, the National Agricultural Work Conference decided to launch a patriotic production (bumper harvest in old liberated areas) campaign throughout the country. Now this campaign has achieved great success. This year, the broad masses of farmers have enthusiastically responded to the call of the People's Government, combining their personal interests with the interests of the state, actively organizing mutual aid in labor, participating in competitions, and improving farming techniques, thereby overcoming various natural disasters and achieving the goal of increased production. This year, the output of various major crops has increased significantly compared to last year, and the output of cotton has exceeded the highest pre-war level.

(2) In order to strengthen national defense, adapt to industrial development, and improve people's living standards, based on the fact that some national agricultural production has approached pre-war levels this year, while others are reaching pre-war levels, and based on the favorable conditions that another 100 million people will implement land reform this winter and next spring, and that farmers' ability to reproduce has increased significantly, the conference formulated a preliminary plan for national agricultural production for next year. This plan requires that next year's national grain output and the output of major industrial raw materials recover and exceed pre-war levels. To complete this production plan and increase grain production, all localities must first continue to implement the policy of "organizing to develop production," and greatly develop and steadily improve agricultural labor mutual aid organizations. Secondly, agricultural technology should be further improved, and efforts should be made to increase the yield per unit area. Thirdly, we must strengthen basic construction for drought prevention, flood control, and pest control to prevent natural disasters.

Minister Li emphasized the importance of labor mutual aid in developing agricultural production in his summary. He pointed out that all localities must implement the policy of large-scale development and steady improvement of labor mutual aid, and formulate different development plans for various types of mutual aid organizations according to local specific conditions. Old liberated areas should systematically guide primary mutual aid organizations to develop into long-term, fixed-type mutual aid teams. In old liberated areas where labor mutual aid organizations already have a foundation, if the necessary conditions are met, the organizational form of agricultural production cooperatives can be appropriately promoted under leadership. The characteristics of this type of production cooperative are: land and labor are used as shares, and production is operated jointly. Agricultural production cooperatives can more rationally use labor and rationally utilize land, which can solve the contradiction between collective labor and decentralized management of general mutual aid teams, and give play to the enthusiasm of collective production. In some old areas, agricultural production cooperatives have shown their superiority over general cooperatives. They will be the bridge for our agricultural production to move from individual to collective.

The conference also discussed issues such as adjusting crop acreage and improving production in mountainous areas, and studied how to prepare for the division of national economic zones.

    全国农业工作会议闭幕
    中央人民政府农业部召开的全国农业工作会议已在九月二十五日结束，前后开会半月。这次会议研究了一九五一年上半年农业工作经验，拟定了一九五二年农业生产计划。农业部李书城部长在大会总结中指出：
    （一）今年二月，全国农业工作会议决定在全国范围开展爱国生产（老解放区为丰产）运动，现在这个运动已经有了伟大的成绩。今年，广大农民热烈响应人民政府的号召，把个人利益和国家利益结合起来，积极组织劳动互助，参加竞赛，改进耕作技术，因而，战胜了各种自然灾害，达到了增产的目的。今年，各种主要作物都比去年增产很多，棉花的产量已超过了战前的最高水平。
    （二）为了增强国防，适应工业发展和提高人民生活水平，根据今年全国农业生产有的已接近战前水平，有的正达到战前水平的情况，并根据今冬明春又将有一亿人口的地区实行土地改革，以及农民再生产的能力已显著提高等有利条件，大会拟定了明年度全国农业生产的初步计划，这个计划要求明年全国的粮食产量，和主要工业原料的产量恢复并超过战前的水平。要完成这个生产计划，作到粮食增产，各地首先必须继续贯彻“组织起来发展生产”的方针，大量发展并稳步提高农业劳动互助组织。其次，应进一步改进农业技术，努力提高单位面积的产量。第三，要加强防旱、防涝、治虫的基本建设，以防发生自然灾害。
  李部长在总结中强调劳动互助在发展农业生产上的重要性，他指出：各地必须贯彻大量发展和稳步提高劳动互助的方针，按当地具体条件，规定各种类型互助组织不同的发展计划。老解放区要有计划地引导初级的互助组织，发展成为长期定型的互助组。在劳动互助组织已有基础的老解放区，如果具备了必要的条件，可以有领导地适当提倡农业生产合作社的组织形式。这种生产合作社的特点是：土地劳力入股、合伙经营生产。农业生产合作社更可合理使用劳力和合理利用土地，这样，就可以解决一般互助组集体劳动和分散经营的矛盾，发挥集体生产的积极性。有的老区，农业生产合作社已显出了它比一般合作社的优越性，它将是我们农业生产由个体走向集体的桥梁。
    这次大会曾讨论调整作物面积、改进山区生产等问题，并曾研究如何准备划分全国的经济区划。
