The First National State-Owned Enterprise Asset Inventory and Capital Verification Conference was held on August 17th, with representatives from various central ministries and major administrative regions attending. The conference lasted for twelve days and concluded on August 30th. During this conference, the guidelines and tasks, regulations, and methods for asset inventory and capital verification were discussed, and three groups were organized, namely, reporting, valuation, and accounting, to specifically study the above three issues; the draft reporting forms were revised; several price standards were established; and a temporarily compiled unified accounting subject for asset inventory and capital verification was drafted. The comrades who participated in the conference gained a consistent and correct understanding of the important significance, tasks, and methods of asset inventory and capital verification. At the closing meeting, Zhu Lizhi, Deputy Director of the National State-Owned Enterprise Asset Inventory and Capital Verification Committee, made a concluding report, and Li Fuchun, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, attended and delivered a speech. Based on the instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee and the summary of the conference discussions, the conference clarified that the purpose of this asset inventory and capital verification is to establish economic accounting-based management for state-owned enterprises and to promote the establishment and improvement of planned management in state-owned enterprises. The conference also made the following provisions for asset inventory and capital verification work in national state-owned enterprise departments:

(1) From September to December of this year, the central task should generally be to prepare the 1952 plan and carry out asset inventory and capital verification work. If these two tasks can be done well, national state-owned enterprises will be likely to implement planned management and economic accounting systems next year. The preparation of the 1952 plan and the asset inventory and capital verification work must be closely integrated, because the preparation of the plan is the basis for capital verification, capital verification is an important part of the financial plan, and asset inventory and price revaluation are preparations for capital verification and the preparation of next year's plan.

(2) Based on the actual foundation of the plans for the first half of this year by various enterprise departments under the ministries and major administrative regions, and the preparation of the asset inventory and capital verification work, it has been decided to change the original provision to verify 1951 capital according to the plan for the second half of this year, to verifying next year’s enterprise capital according to the actual capital situation at the end of September this year and the estimated figures for the fourth quarter, and according to the 1952 plan. If individual regions or individual departments have already conducted inventory and valuation based on the actual figures at the end of June, they should continue to do so. They only need to use this as a basis to prepare a balance sheet as of the end of September and fill out the other specified reporting forms.

(3) Valuation Standards: The National Capital Verification Committee is now establishing several price standards, which should be used uniformly in principle to achieve uniform valuation nationwide; however, various ministries and major administrative regions may supplement the established valuation standards, and if any are found to be unsuitable, they must also submit revision opinions to the National Capital Verification Committee for revision.

(4) Local state-owned enterprises should also conduct asset inventory and capital verification to establish the foundation for implementing the economic accounting system. As for whether they should proceed simultaneously with state-owned enterprises this year, this will be determined by the major administrative regions based on specific conditions.

(5) The state bank's credit to enterprises and the gradual and rapid elimination of commercial credit between enterprises play a significant role in developing production and promoting the economic accounting system, and are closely related to asset inventory and capital verification. Therefore, after state-owned enterprises verify their capital, each enterprise must implement independent accounting and establish a settlement (transfer and clearing) system with the bank. Within the fixed amount of working capital, a portion must be provided by the state bank through credit, and the proportion can be specifically determined based on the actual situation. Non-fixed working capital, such as seasonal storage, will generally be resolved through short-term credit from the state bank. After enterprises implement independent accounting, commercial credit between enterprises should be seriously eliminated, and credit should be concentrated in the state bank. The bank conducts capital supervision of enterprises through credit, settlement, and currency management to promote enterprises to explore reserve forces and accelerate capital turnover. The People's Bank needs to specifically study and deploy this matter.

(6) Regarding the storage problem of enterprises, when each enterprise must over-store raw materials or accumulate products due to its own special circumstances, it must be approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, and the bank provides credit or the financial department allocates additional working capital. If the competent department or administration bureau needs to unify purchases and sales, it can set up a supply and marketing organization within the department or bureau and determine its capital as an economic accounting unit. After each enterprise verifies its capital, if there is surplus working capital, it should formulate a plan and turn it over in installments. For all stagnant materials occupied in working capital, enterprise departments at all levels should quickly formulate plans for use and adjustment, and organize effective comprehensive adjustment to put idle materials into production and turn them into active capital. If, after maximum efforts are made to adjust, the turnover is affected due to the failure to immediately dispose of stagnant materials in the fixed amount of capital, a credit plan can be submitted to the bank, and necessary support will be provided according to credit procedures.

(7) The entrusted materials turned over to the central government during last year's inventory will still be handled in accordance with the decision of the National Materials Conference of the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government in June.

(8) The capital situation is changing every day, so each department must establish the necessary financial management system (such as warehouse management system, material requisition and return system, etc.) during asset inventory and capital verification, based on the problems found and the summary of experience. Accounting reports and accounting subjects, as well as planning reports and statistical reports, are required to be consistent from next year onwards, so as to strengthen national planning management, financial management, and statistical supervision.

(9) To do the work well, first of all, the head must be responsible and personally grasp it; and a group of cadres must be designated to be specifically responsible; mobilize a part of the cadres to open training classes to explain the methods and regulations and the issues discussed at this meeting clearly. Secondly, mobilize the masses and rely on the workers; rely on the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League to ensure, and obtain the assistance of the local trade union and the leadership of the local Party. Thirdly, we must go to the factories to create typical examples, summarize experience, and promote comprehensiveness.

    全国国营企业清理资产核定资金会议规定
    国营企业应迅速编制计划核定资金
    为明年实行计划管理和经济核算制作好准备工作
    第一次全国国营企业清理资产核定资金会议，于八月十七日举行，中央各部及各大行政区均有代表出席。大会进行了十二天，已于八月三十日闭幕。在这次会议中，讨论了清理资产核定资金的方针与任务、条例和办法，并组织了表报、估价、会计三个小组，专门研究上述三个问题；修正了表报草案；订出了若干价格标准；拟出了清理资产核定资金使用的暂编统一会计科目。参加会议的同志对于清理资财的重要意义、任务与办法，获得一致的正确认识。在闭幕会上，全国国营企业清理资产核定资金委员会朱理治副主任作了总结报告，政务院财政经济委员会李富春副主任并出席讲话。会议根据财政经济委员会之指示及会议讨论的总结，明确了这次清理资产核定资金的目的，在于建立国营企业经济核算制的经营管理与促进国营企业建立与提高计划管理。会议并对全国国营企业部门进行清理资产核定资金工作作了如下规定：（一）从本年九月至十二月，中心任务一般地应是编制一九五二年计划与进行清理资产核定资金的工作。如能做好这两个工作，全国国营企业即有可能在明年实行计划管理和经济核算制度。编制一九五二年计划和进行清理资产核定资金工作必须密切结合起来，因为编制计划是核定资金的基础，核定资金是财务计划的重要部分，而清理资产与重估价格，是核定资金及编制明年计划的准备工作。（二）根据各部及各大行政区各企业部门上半年计划的现实基础，以及清理资产核定资金工作的准备情况，决定将原按今年下半年计划来核定一九五一年资金的规定，改为按今年九月底的实有资金状况及第四季的预计数，并根据一九五二年计划，核定明年的企业资金。如个别地区、个别部门业已依六月底实有数进行清点和估价者，自应照旧进行，只须依此为基础，做出九月底资产负债表，并填制其他规定的几种表报即可。
    （三）估价标准：现由全国核资委员会订出若干价格标准，原则上统一使用，以求全国估价统一；但各部及各大行政区可根据所定估价标准，予以充实，如发现有不适合者，亦须提出修正意见，报送全国核资委员会予以修正。（四）地方公营企业，为建立实行经济核算制的基础，亦应进行清理资产与核定资金。至于今年应否与国营企业同时进行，由各大行政区根据具体条件自行规定。（五）国家银行对企业的信贷与逐步而迅速地取消企业相互间的商业信用，对于发展生产促进经济核算制有着重大作用，且与清理资产核定资金的关系至为密切，因此国营企业核定资金之后，各企业必须实行独立会计，并与银行建立结算（划拨清算）制度。各企业在定额流动资金内，须由国家银行信贷一部分，其比例大小，可依实际情况来具体规定。对于非定额流动资金，如季节性的储存等，一概由国家银行短期信贷解决。凡企业实现独立会计之后，企业相互间应认真取消商业信用，信用一概集中到国家银行。银行透过信贷、结算与货币管理，对企业进行资金监督，以促进企业发掘后备力量，并加速资金周转，此事需人民银行具体研究与部署。（六）关于企业的储存问题，各企业因本身特殊情况，必须超额储存原料或积存产品时，得经政务院财政经济委员会批准后，由银行信贷或由财政增拨流动资金。主管部或管理局，如需统一购销者，可在部内或局内设供销机构，确定其资金，作为一个经济核算单位。各企业经核定资金后，如有多余流动资金，应订立计划，分期上缴。凡在流动资金中，如占有呆滞材料，全部由各级企业部门，迅速拟订使用和调节计划，组织有效的全面调剂，使闲置的材料投入生产，变成活动资金。如经过最大努力进行调节之后，在定额资金中因呆滞材料未能即时处理而影响周转时，可向银行提出信贷计划，按信贷手续，予以必要的支持。（七）去年清仓上缴中央的代管物资，仍依照中央人民政府财政部六月全国物资会议的决定处理。（八）资金情况，每天都在变动，因此各部门必须在清理资产核定资金当中，根据发现的问题和经验的总结，随即建立必要的财务管理制度（如仓库管理制度，领料退料制度等）。会计表报和会计科目与计划表报和统计表报，要求从明年起能达到一致，这样就可加强国家计划管理、财务管理和统计监督。（九）要使工作做好，首先，必须首长负责，亲自掌握；并须指定一批干部，专门负责；动员一部分干部开训练班，将办法条例及此次会议讨论的问题，讲解清楚。其次，发动群众，依靠工人；要依靠党、行政、工会、青年团大家来保证，要取得地方工会的协助与地方党的领导。其三，必须到工厂去创造典型，总结经验，推动全面。
