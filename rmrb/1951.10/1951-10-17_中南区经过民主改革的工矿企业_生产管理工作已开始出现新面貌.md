    Industrial and mining enterprises in the Central and South China region that have undergone democratic reform are beginning to show a new look in their production management. As of the end of August, a total of 236 industrial and mining enterprises in the region (excluding Hunan) had undergone democratic reform, along with 60 units in the transportation and construction industries. Currently, the progress of the movement in various locations is mostly in the stage of ending or about to end the remaining feudal forces, and 68 units in the first batch of key units have entered the stage of democratic unity. In the units that have carried out the democratic reform movement, feudal reactionary forces have been purged; the political consciousness of the worker masses has been unprecedentedly raised, and their understanding and love for the Communist Party have been greatly deepened. The patriotic production increase donation movement that began in early June has also been carried out more enthusiastically and rapidly in these units. Many workers who had participated in gang organizations have now withdrawn from those gangs, and those who had participated in reactionary parties and groups have also voluntarily handed in their documents. With the improvement of political consciousness, the workers' sense of responsibility as masters has become stronger. Even in the process of opposing the remaining feudal forces, the workers' production efficiency has not decreased, and some units have even seen improvements. For example, workers at a certain steel company found ways to improve refractory materials during the movement, which doubled the production efficiency of the Bessemer furnace. The Enan Power Plant recently reduced its coal consumption rate, setting a new record in Central and South China. After the victory in the struggle against the remaining feudal forces, workers in many units enthusiastically launched competitions to complete production tasks ahead of schedule. Because the leadership of each unit conducted relatively in-depth class education and detailed grievance connection work for the worker masses during the democratic reform movement, a large number of strong and reliable new activists emerged during the movement, thus making the trade union organizations gradually tend to be sound and consolidated. According to preliminary statistics from units in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangzhou four provinces and one city that have undergone democratic reform, 11,955 new activists have emerged from the democratic reform movement. They loyally serve the workers and are elected by the workers as trade union cadres or representatives to the workers' congress. Through the practical education of the democratic reform movement, the bureaucratic work style of some cadres in industrial and mining enterprises has also been transformed, and the concerns that democratic reform would affect production have also been dispelled, thus more clearly recognizing the necessity and possibility of relying on the working class to manage enterprises well. Most cadres have gone deep into workshops, groups, and workers' dormitories to make friends with workers, discuss issues, and strengthen their connections with each other. All of these have laid a good foundation for the great production movement in the future.

    中南区经过民主改革的工矿企业
    生产管理工作已开始出现新面貌
    中南区进行了民主改革运动的工矿企业单位，生产管理工作开始出现了新面貌。到八月底止，全区（缺湖南）进行民主改革的工矿企业单位共有二百三十六个；以搬运、建筑为主的行业单位计有六十个。目前各地运动的进度，大部分正处在结束或即将结束反封建残余势力的阶段，第一批重点单位中已有六十八个单位转入民主团结阶段。在开展了民主改革运动的单位中，封建反动势力已被肃清；工人群众的政治觉悟已空前提高，对共产党的认识和热爱已大为加深。六月初开始的爱国增产捐献运动在这些单位中也就开展得比较热烈与迅速。不少参加过帮会组织的工人现已纷纷退出那些帮会，参加过反动党、团的也都自动交出了证件。随着政治觉悟的提高，工人们的主人翁责任感更加强烈。就是在反对封建残余势力的斗争过程中，工人生产效率也未降低，有的单位还有提高。如某钢铁公司的工人在运动中设法改进耐火材料，使贝氏炉的生产效率提高一倍。鄂南电厂最近降低了燃煤率，创造了中南区的最新纪录。许多单位的工人在反封建残余势力斗争胜利后，热烈地开展了提前完成生产任务的竞赛。由于各单位领导方面在民主改革运动中对工人群众进行了比较深刻的阶级教育和细致的诉苦串连工作，运动中生长出大批坚强可靠的新的积极分子，因而使工会组织也逐步趋于健全和巩固。根据广东、广西、湖北、江西、广州四省一市进行民主改革的单位的初步统计，从民主改革运动中涌现出来的新的积极分子已有一万一千九百五十五名。他们忠诚地为工人办事，被工人们选为工会的干部或职工代表大会的代表。经过民主改革运动的实际教育，工矿企业中某些干部的官僚主义作风也转变了，怕民主改革影响生产的顾虑也打消了，因而更明确地认识到依靠工人阶级管好企业的必要和可能。多数干部已深入车间、小组和工人宿舍，去和工人交朋友，商量问题，密切了彼此的联系。这些都为今后的大生产运动打下了良好基础。
