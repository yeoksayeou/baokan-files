    Commemorating the Fifteenth Anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's Death
    Lu Xun's Former Residence in Beijing to Open on October 19th
    [This Newspaper's Report] October 19th marks the fifteenth anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death. Every year on this day, thousands upon thousands of people visit Lu Xun's former residence at No. 21, West Third Alley, Gongmenkou, Fuchengmen Inner Street, Beijing. The narrow alley is always packed. Visitors include students, teachers, literary and art workers, cadres from various organizations, soldiers, citizens, and international friends. They all want to learn more about this great Chinese people's writer, thinker, and fighter, and they all want to visit the place where he lived and worked, to admire his relics, to see his study and bedroom—that small room he called "the tiger's tail"—and the two jujube trees he mentioned in his works.
    In order to commemorate Mr. Lu Xun, the Cultural Relics Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government has decided to open Lu Xun's former residence for one month, from October 19th to November 18th. Groups wishing to visit should first bring a letter of introduction to Lu Xun's former residence at No. 21, West Third Alley, Gongmenkou, Fuchengmen Inner Street, Beijing, to register and arrange a visiting date and time. Registration will be open from October 18th to October 26th. Individual visits are limited to the morning (8:30 AM to 12:00 PM) and do not require registration.

    纪念鲁迅先生逝世十五周年
    北京鲁迅故居定十月十九日开放
    【本报讯】十月十九日是鲁迅先生逝世十五周年纪念日，每年的这一天都有成千上万的人到北京阜城门内宫门口西三条二十一号鲁迅故居去参观，狭窄的胡同里总是挤得水泄不通。参观者包括学生、教师、文艺工作者、各机关干部、战士、市民和国际友人。他们都想更多地了解这位伟大的中国人民文学家、思想家和战士，都想到他生前所曾经在那里作息过的地方去瞻仰他的遗物，看看他的书室兼卧房——那一小间被他称为“老虎尾巴”的屋子，和他曾经在作品里提到过的两株枣树。
    为了纪念鲁迅先生，中央人民政府文化部文物局决定将鲁迅故居于十月十九日至十一月十八日开放一个月。集体参观者可以先持介绍函至阜城门内宫门口西三条二十一号鲁迅故居去登记，以便排定参观日时。登记从十月十八日开始至十月二十六日截止。个人参观仅限上午（八时半至十二时），可不必登记。
