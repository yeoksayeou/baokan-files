    East China's Rivers Safely Pass Flood Season
    Huai River Basin and Other Areas Successfully Lift Defenses
    All rivers in the East China region have safely passed this year's flood season. The Huai River Basin successfully lifted its defenses on the very day the people of the whole country celebrated National Day. Except for coastal areas, other rivers had successively lifted defenses before the end of September.
    The major rivers in East China – the Yangtze River, Huai River, Grand Canal, Yi River, and Shu River – did not experience any floods this year. Only some coastal areas were hit by typhoons, with seawater intruding into some sea dikes, but the impact was not significant. This is the result of the widespread river management and the general reinforcement of dikes, embankments, and sea dikes in East China this spring, as well as the result of the diligent flood prevention efforts this summer. Of particular importance is the completion of the first phase of the Huai River harnessing project, which played a decisive role in controlling the Huai River floods and reducing the suffering from the Huai River. The Huai River, which used to be plagued by floods every year, remained safe this year. There are numerous inland rivers, lakes, and streams in the East China region. These small rivers and streams had not been dredged for many years, resulting in poor drainage. In the past, even if major rivers did not flood, these small rivers and streams could easily turn into a vast expanse of water during heavy rains, making it difficult to drain the accumulated water. This year, because the vast rural areas of East China implemented land reform, farmers were very enthusiastic about water conservancy construction. Many small rivers and streams have been dredged and renovated to some extent. This year, East China built more than 360,000 small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, which greatly reduced the severity of waterlogging disasters.
    This summer, the flood prevention organizations at all levels in East China were relatively sound, and they were able to maintain close contact and take their responsibilities seriously during flood prevention. This is also an important factor that enabled the rivers in East China to safely pass the flood season this year. In mid-August, when typhoons hit Zhejiang, southern Jiangsu, and coastal areas of northern Jiangsu, the winds were strong and the waves were high. Fortunately, the local flood prevention organizations were well prepared in advance, preventing major disasters. Only in the Nantong Special District of northern Jiangsu, due to the proximity of the typhoon center, the tide level was particularly high, and several sea dikes were washed away or submerged by seawater.
    Currently, except for coastal areas that may still be affected by typhoons, the water levels of all rivers have fallen below the flood prevention level and are continuing to fall.

### 华东各江河安度汛期  淮河流域等地已胜利撤防

    华东各江河安度汛期
    淮河流域等地已胜利撤防
    华东区各江各河都已安然度过了今年的洪水期。淮河流域已在全国人民欢度国庆节的当天胜利撤防。除沿海地区外，其他各河也已在九月底前先后撤防。
    华东区的主要河流长江、淮河、运河、沂河、沭河今年都没有发生水灾；只有一部分沿海地区遭受台风袭击，部分海塘为海水侵入，但影响也不大。这是华东今春普遍治河、普遍培修堤、圩、海塘的成绩，也是今夏努力防汛的成绩。其中尤其重要的是根治淮河第一期工程的完成，对控制淮河洪水、减除淮河水患起决定性作用。年年闹水灾的淮河，今年始终没有出险。华东地区内河、湖泊、港汊极多，这些小河、港汊，多年没有疏浚，宣泄不畅。往年大的江河即使不闹水灾，每逢大雨，这些小河、港汊容易连成汪洋一片，积水难排。今年因为华东广大农村实行了土地改革，农民对兴修水利很热心，许多小河、港汊都经过一些疏浚和整理。今年华东共修了约三十六万多处小型的农田水利工程，因而大大减轻了内涝的灾害程度。
    今年夏天，华东各级防汛组织比较健全，它们在防汛中都能密切联系和认真负责。这也是使今年华东各河安然度过汛期的重要因素。八月中旬，台风侵袭浙江、苏南、及苏北沿海地区时，风紧浪急，幸赖各地防汛组织事先准备充分，未成大灾。仅苏北南通专区因台风中心逼近，潮位特高，有数处海堤被海水冲毁或湮没。
    现在，除沿海还可能有台风的侵袭外，各河水位都已降至防汛水位以下，并在继续下降着。
