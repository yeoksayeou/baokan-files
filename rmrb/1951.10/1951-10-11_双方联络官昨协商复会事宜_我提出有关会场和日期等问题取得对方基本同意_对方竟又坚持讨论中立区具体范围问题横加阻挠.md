Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 10th. The following is the information our reporter obtained from the headquarters at the Korean front regarding yesterday's meeting of liaison officers from both sides:

Based on the proposals made by General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, to General Ridgway, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, on October 7th and October 9th, our liaison officers, Senior Colonel Zhang Chunshan, Lieutenant Colonel Chai Chengwen, and Senior Colonel Li Ping, met with the opposing side's liaison officers, Senior Colonel Murray, Lieutenant Colonel Edwards, and Lieutenant Colonel Li Shurong, at Panmunjom at 10:00 AM on October 10th, to discuss the resumption of the meetings of both delegations. Based on the principles already agreed upon by the commanders of both sides, our liaison officers proposed temporary arrangements for both sides to jointly be responsible for the protection of the meeting area when the delegations reconvene, the determination of the specific location of the meeting venue, the equipment and layout of the venue, and the date and time of the resumption, and obtained basic agreement from the opposing side's liaison officers on these issues. However, the opposing side's liaison officers then raised the issue of the specific scope of the neutral zone. Our liaison officers immediately pointed out that our commander had already clearly stipulated in the letters to the opposing commander on October 7th and October 9th that the issue of expanding the scope of the neutral zone should be discussed and resolved by both delegations at the first meeting after the resumption. However, the opposing side's liaison officers claimed that the opposing commander and the liaison officers themselves had not studied our commander's letter of October 9th and insisted on discussing this issue, resulting in the failure of the liaison officers' meeting to reach an agreement. Consequently, the meetings of the two delegations could not be resumed quickly. Finally, our liaison officers requested the opposing side to study our commander's letter of October 9th in detail, and agreed to continue the meeting at 10:00 AM on October 11th. The meeting ended at 12:25 PM.

    双方联络官昨协商复会事宜
    我提出有关会场和日期等问题取得对方基本同意
    对方竟又坚持讨论中立区具体范围问题横加阻挠
    【新华社平壤十日电】本社记者自朝鲜前线总部获悉今日双方联络官会谈经过如下：
    根据十月七日与十月九日朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军与中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军向联合国军李奇微总司令所提出的建议，我方联络官张春山上校、柴成文中校、李平一上校在十月十日上午十时在板门店与对方联络官穆莱上校、爱德华中校、李树荣中校会晤，协商双方代表团复会的事宜。我方联络官根据双方司令官业已同意的原则，提出了代表团复会时，双方共同负责保护会场区的临时安排，会场具体地点的确定，会场的设备与布置，以及复会的日期和时间等问题，并取得了对方联络官在这些问题上基本上的同意。但是，对方联络官却又提出了中立区的具体范围的问题。我方联络官当即指出：我方司令官在十月七日与十月九日致对方司令官的函件中，已经明白规定，关于扩大中立区范围的问题，应由双方代表团在复会后的第一次会议上讨论解决。但对方联络官声称：对方司令官与联络官本身，对于我方司令官十月九日的函件均未研究，仍然坚持讨论此项问题，以致双方联络官会议未能取得协议。双方代表团的会议，因之不能迅速恢复。最后我方联络官要求对方详细研究我方司令官十月九日的函件，并约定十月十一日上午十时继续举行会议。会议在午后十二时二十五分结束。
