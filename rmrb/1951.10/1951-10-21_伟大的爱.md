Editor's note: Published here is a National Day essay from the October 4th "Xi'an Mass Daily". The author uses concise language to write about several things a People's Liberation Army soldier encounters in a day. From these everyday things, the new ideological outlook and patriotism of the people of New China are displayed.

These days, I have been constantly stirred by these things and often recall them with pleasure. Whenever I think of them, I want to talk about them to my comrades with gestures. After talking for a while, everyone is always happy for a while. This may be considered very ordinary by some; however, from this, I am increasingly aware of how much our motherland is loved by the broad masses of the people!

It was one day in late June. I and another comrade were traveling west to Changwu in a military vehicle. I have already forgotten the number of this vehicle, but I remember that it was a ten-wheel truck carrying military shoes. The driver was a driver who had served in the Kuomintang army (we knew this from talking to the assistant), and an assistant dressed in military uniform. What I want to say is about the story of this assistant: he is only nineteen years old this year, from Sichuan, named Wang Xuemin, and quite strong. His oil-stained clothes were torn in several places, and there were bloodstains on his hands, which looked like they were scratched by some iron object.

Comrade Wang Xuemin is a very optimistic person. He has great hope for the beautiful future of the motherland. This hope encourages him, so that he is always happy no matter what.

We have seen it many times: as soon as the car stops, the driver in plain clothes wipes his sweat, waves his fan, and runs to the tree beside the road to cool off. He keeps muttering, "Oh, it's really hot."

Wang Xuemin—that lovely assistant—is even busier at this time. The sun is like fire, and his heart is hotter than fire. Watering and adding oil; kicking the tires; sometimes lying on his back under the car, looking here and touching there; sometimes climbing into the carriage, carefully checking the sacks full of military shoes to see if there are any worn places; and sometimes wiping the front of the car carefully with a cloth, wiping for a while, stroking for a while, like a mother's caress for her child. The sun is like a pot of fire, and people are drilling into the shade, only he doesn't seem to feel that he is standing in the sunlight in the middle of summer. "Comrade, take a break and cool off." I began to greet him with admiration. He smiled, walked over, and sat with us. He wiped a handful of sweat, looked at the car with all his attention, and said to us enthusiastically: "Such things are very precious in the motherland. If we take good care of it, we can use it for a few more years, and save this part of the financial resources to make airplanes and cannons, and transport them to the volunteers, so that we can eliminate a few more American devils!"

When the car reached the top of Tingkou Slope in Changwu, suddenly dark clouds gathered and it started to rain heavily. He hurriedly covered the car with tarpaulin, and carefully tidied up everything that should be tidied up, as if not even a single thread of the motherland could be lost for no reason.

Such things are very common in the motherland. Precisely because they are common, we can better understand how much the broad masses of the people love their motherland!

Originally, we had to walk more than a mile before we could take a shortcut to a certain place, but we were afraid of troubling the driver, so we bid farewell to them while the car was parked. The car sped away, and we walked on the muddy road. At this time, a bus was driving westward from a distance and suddenly stopped in front of us. A driver in worker's clothes waved to us: "Comrades, get in the car, the road is too bad."

"Thank you, we are about to take a shortcut."

After we explained the reason and declined the ride, the passengers in the car shed almost at the same time grabbed three straw hats from the car window and insisted that we wear them. We couldn't resist and took one, but before we could thank them, the car drove away with a "buzz".

At this time, my emotions were boiling like boiling water. I thought: How sincere and simple the people's love for us is! This is because we are the people's army, an army that defends the motherland and defends victory. Thinking of this, I couldn't help but recall that in the army, I saw many soldiers getting up in the middle of the night to secretly run to the playground to practice throwing grenades; they always practiced so carefully and hard, and their wrists were swollen, but they continued to persist. Once, I asked a soldier like this: "Comrade, does it hurt? Even your arms are swollen." He said simply: "How can it not hurt! But, comrade! It's much better than the people of the whole country suffering; aren't the Korean people being harmed by American imperialism!? We must never let these beasts run wild on our land." Speaking of this, he held the grenade model high and said: "Aren't the enemies very afraid of this guy? For the eternal happiness of the people of the motherland, do you think this little pain is worth anything!"

The People's Liberation Army soldiers in the rear are so faithfully doing the work of consolidating national defense and defending the motherland.

My comrade and I continued to move forward in the rain. A steep slope appeared in front of us, but the rain was getting heavier and heavier, and the road was so slippery that we couldn't get a foothold. How could we walk? Later, we stopped in front of a dilapidated earth temple, preparing to wait for a while and walk when the rain was lighter. At this time, an elementary school student came towards us, very small, looking at most eleven or twelve years old, with big eyes and a smile on his face. His trouser legs were half-rolled up, barefoot, and he walked so nimbly and lively. As soon as he saw us, he first gave a salute, and then enthusiastically asked us where we were going. When he learned that we were going downhill, without saying anything, he took our hands and led us to his home, saying as he walked, "Don't go any further, you will slip into the ditch!"

It turned out that his name was Zhang Xiaogui. His father joined the volunteer army before the busy farming season, and only he and his mother were left in the family. His mother was very capable of working, and life was pretty good.

As soon as he got home, he urged his mother to cook.

In the center of the room hung a portrait of Chairman Mao. Xiaogui looked up at the portrait, then turned his head and said to us: "This portrait was bought by my mother with money. My mother said: Chairman Mao is the savior of us poor people." Then, he took out a small notebook from under his clothes. Although his clothes were wet, the notebook was still dry. I casually opened it and saw a few lines of crooked words written inside.

"Second aunt donated five eggs to buy airplanes. Fifth uncle donated one liter of wheat to buy cannons to fight American bandits..."

Ah! He had just gone to raise donations in the rain. I don't know why, I felt a great respect for this ordinary elementary school student. I stood up, took his little hand, stroked his head and said: "Little brother, you are really a good child of the Mao Zedong era. You are so young, but you are doing a lot of work for the motherland." My words were obviously an encouragement to him. I saw him happily squinting his eyes into a line, waving his little hands in the air, and saying with a smile: "I can sell these things for money. I already have 37,500 yuan now. In the future, I will continue to promote well and donate more airplanes and cannons!" Then, he climbed on my knee very naively, pointing to my badge and reading the words one by one. He said: "Communist Party, Chairman Mao, People's Republic of China, Chinese People's Liberation Army, I can write all these words well." Suddenly, he asked me solemnly: "Uncle Liberation Army, guess why I write well?" "You tell me, I can't guess." I deliberately teased him.

He looked at me with a smile, tilted his head playfully and said, "Because I love them."

Now the story I want to tell is over. Friends, how do you feel? As for me, whenever I recall this short story, I understand even more: How much our motherland is loved and supported by its people! This love and support is the great power of the motherland!

    伟大的爱
    胡效儒
    编者按：这里刊登的是十月四日西安“群众日报”上的一篇国庆征文。作者用简练的笔墨，写出了一个人民解放军战士在一天当中所遇到的几件事情。从这些日常事情中显示了新中国人民的新的思想面貌与爱国主义精神。
    这些天，我一直被这些事情激动着，并且常常用愉快的心情去回忆它。一想起来，就要向同志们指手划脚地讲。说一阵，大家总要高兴一阵。这，也许有人会认为很平凡；不过，从这里，我越来越清楚地认识到我们的祖国是怎样被广大的人民所热爱啊！
    那还是六月下旬的一天，我和另外一个同志，乘坐了一辆军车，西行到长武去。这个车的号数，我已经忘记了。但是我还记得那是一辆载运军鞋的十轮卡。驾驶者是一个曾在国民党军队中服务过的司机（我们和助手谈话时知道的），和穿着军人服装的一个助手。我所要说的是关于这个助手的故事：他今年才十九岁，四川人，叫王学敏，身体挺结实。沾着油渍的衣服上，挂破了好几处，手上还有血疤，看情形像是被什么铁东西碰伤的。
    王学敏同志是一个非常乐观的人，他对于祖国美满的将来，抱着极大的希望，这种希望鼓舞着他，使他无论在什么时候，总是高高兴兴的。
    我们已经看见过好多次了：车一停下来，那个穿便服的司机，一面擦汗，一面挥动扇子，跑到路旁树下去纳凉。嘴里不住嘀咕着：“啊呀：真热死人。”
    王学敏——那个可爱的助手——这一下就更忙了。太阳如火，他的心比火还热。灌水添油；踏踏轮胎；一会儿仰卧在车底下，看看这，摸摸那；一会儿爬进车厢，仔细地检查装满军鞋的麻袋，看有擦破的地方没有；一会儿又用拭布小心翼翼地揩着车头，揩一阵，抚摸一阵，好像妈妈对孩子的抚爱一样。太阳像一盆烈火，人们都向阴凉处钻，只有他似乎一点儿也不觉得他是站在盛夏季节的太阳光下。 “同志，歇会儿，凉一凉吧。”我开始抱着爱慕的感情，向他打招呼。他笑了笑走过来，和我们坐在一起。擦了一把汗，全神贯注地望着车子，热情地对我们说：“这样的东西，在祖国是很宝贵的。爱护它，就可以多用几年，节省下这一部分财力，做成飞机、大炮，运给志愿军，多消灭几个美国鬼子多好！”
    车走到长武亭口坡头上，突然浓云密布，下起倾盆大雨来，他急急忙忙用油布盖好车厢，仔细地把一切应拾掇的都拾掇好了，似乎祖国的一针一线，也不能让平白无故地遭受损失。
    像这样的事，在祖国很普通，正因为普通，我们才更明白，广大人民群众是怎样地热爱着自己的祖国啊！
    本来还要走一里多路，我们才抄小路到某地去，可是怕司机麻烦，就乘车停的这会儿告别了他们。汽车飞驰而去，我们在泥泞的路上走着。这时，远远地有一辆客车向西驶来，突然停在我们面前不动了。一个穿工人服装的司机向我们招手：“同志，坐上车吧，路太烂了。”
    “谢谢你，我们马上就要走小路啦。”
    当我们说明原因，谢绝乘坐之后，车棚里的旅客们，差不多同一时间，抢着从车窗递出三个草帽来，非叫我们戴上不可。我们扭不过，接了一个，还来不及道谢，“嗡”的一声车就开走了。
    这时，我的感情像滚开的水一样沸腾了。我想：人民对我们的爱是多么热诚纯朴啊！这就是因为我们是人民的军队，是保卫祖国、保卫胜利的军队。想到这里，我又不能不回忆起在部队中，我看见很多战士为了练习投弹，半夜起来，偷偷地跑到操场里去；他们总是那么用心卖力地练习，手腕肿得胖胖的，还继续坚持。有一次，我这样问一个战士：“同志，痛吗？连胳膊都肿啦。”他干干脆脆地说：“怎么不痛！不过，同志！总比全国人民遭灾难强得多啊；朝鲜人民不是被美帝国主义残害着吗！？我们绝不能让这些野兽在咱们的国土上横行。”说到这里，他把手榴弹模型举得高高的说：“敌人不是挺怕这个家伙吗？为了祖国人民永远的幸福，你想，这点儿痛，又算得了什么呢！”
    在后方的解放军战士们，就是这样忠实地做着巩固国防、保卫祖国的工作。
    我和我的一个同志在雨地里继续前进着。一段陡坡出现在眼前了，可是雨越下越大，路滑的搭不住脚，怎样走呢？后来在一座破烂的土地庙前停下来，准备待一待，雨小了再走。这时，迎面来了一个小学生，个儿小得很，看样子至多有十一、二岁，眼睛大大的，脸上露着微笑。裤腿半卷，精脚，走得那么矫捷活泼。一见我们，先来了个举手礼，随后热情地问我们到那里去。当他知道我们要下坡时，不由分说，两只小手拉了我们两个人往他家走去，边走边说：“可不要再走了，会滑到沟里去的！”
    原来他叫张小贵，父亲在农忙前参加了志愿军，家中就剩下他和妈妈两个人，妈妈很能劳动，日子过得挺可以。
    一到家，他先?喝着妈妈做饭。
    房的正中央，悬挂着毛主席像，小贵抬头望一望这像，然后扭转头对我们说：“这幅像是妈拿钱叫我买来的。妈说：毛主席是咱穷人的救命恩人。”随后，他从衣襟底下掏出一个小本子，衣服虽然淋湿了，但本子还干干的。我顺手揭开一看，里面歪歪曲曲写了几行小字。
    “二婶捐五个鸡蛋，是买飞机的。五学叔捐麦一升，买大炮打美国强盗……”
    啊！他刚才是冒雨募捐去的。不知怎的，我对这个普通小学生，心里非常敬爱起来。我站起来，拉着他的小手，抚着他的头说：“小弟弟，你真是毛泽东时代的好孩子，这么点年纪，给祖国干的工作可不小哩。”我的话显然对他是个鼓舞，只见他乐的眼睛眯成一条线，小手在空中挥舞起来，笑着说：“这些东西，我都可以把它变卖成钱，现在已经有三万七千五百元。往后我还要好好宣传，要捐更多的飞机大炮哩！”接着他很天真地爬在我的膝盖上，指着我的胸章一个字一个字的念。他说：“共产党，毛主席，中华人民共和国，中国人民解放军，这些字，我都能写好。”突然，他一本正经地问我： “解放军叔叔，你猜我为啥写得好？” “你说，我猜不透。”我故意逗他。
    他笑嘻嘻地望了望我，俏皮地偏着头说：“因为我爱他们呀。”
    现在我所要说的故事已经完了。朋友们，你的感觉如何呢？在我，每当回忆完这段小故事，我就更加明白：我们的祖国是怎样受它底人民的热爱与拥护啊！这种热爱与拥护，就是祖国的伟大力量！
