Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd dispatch from Washington: The US, British and French foreign ministers' conference held in Washington from September 12th, planned to establish an "Allied Reserve Force" with nine army divisions and fifteen air groups in the Southeast Asian region, attempting to suppress the expanding Southeast Asian national liberation movement.

It is reported that the conference approved a plan formulated by the US Department of Defense regarding the use of Japanese, Kuomintang remnants, and other Asian puppet troops. The plan stipulates the establishment of a so-called "Allied Reserve Force" in Southeast Asia, composed of one US division, one British division, two French divisions, three Japanese divisions, and two Kuomintang remnant divisions, totaling nine army divisions. The supreme commander will be an American "with experience in leading Allied forces in Asia." In addition, at the request of Britain and France, the United States is responsible for forming fifteen air groups with heavy bombers and fighter planes. This plan has been agreed to by Morrison and Schuman.

According to the US plan, the "Allied Reserve Force" will be used in the so-called "most threatened areas of Southeast Asia," with Singapore currently serving as the concentration point for the force. Three divisions will soon be stationed in Singapore.

The plan also stipulates that the number of divisions from Asian countries will be increased in the future, while the number of divisions from Western countries will be relatively reduced. It is expected that by June or July 1952, the force will be reorganized to include two more Japanese divisions and one Philippine division.

At the Washington conference, the US representative stated that after the signing of the "Treaty of Peace with Japan" and the "US-Japan Security Treaty," the United States and its allies have the opportunity to openly use Japanese manpower and material resources in the Korean battlefield and other battlefields. The US representative also explained to Morrison and Schuman that it would not take long to incorporate Japanese troops into the "Allied Reserve Force" because the US military authorities had long anticipated the need to use Japanese troops in Southeast Asia. Therefore, more than 15,000 Japanese soldiers have already been incorporated into the force, and they will be sent to Singapore as soon as they complete their training. According to the Americans, most of these assembled Japanese soldiers fought in various parts of Southeast Asia during the Pacific War. Junior and mid-level officers are selected from former Japanese military officers, many of whom have directly studied modern tactics on the Korean battlefield.

Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd dispatch: The United States is actively planning to carry out economic aggression against Southeast Asia through Japanese zaibatsu, attempting to monopolize Southeast Asian trade and resources.

The US "Business Week," published on September 15th, admitted that the United States is fostering Japanese industry at the expense of Southeast Asian countries in order to replace Japan's trade with China. The magazine revealed that in order to cope with the difficulties caused by the embargo against China in Japan, the United States has formulated a "Southeast Asia plan" aimed at "completely changing Japan's trade direction" and enabling Japan to "find new markets" in Southeast Asia. This huge and ambitious American plan to develop Southeast Asia will pay special attention to the development of resources such as iron, coal, and manganese in Southeast Asian countries. The magazine stated: "This plan is for Japan to supply mining and transportation equipment, and Japan will obtain raw materials as compensation. Funding may come from loans from the Export-Import Bank and the World Bank, or from long-term Japanese trade loans."

According to the "Asahi Shimbun" of October 6th, the Japanese zaibatsu groups that are first embarking on economic activities in Southeast Asia are the "Japan Economic Reconstruction Association" led by Tokyo Shibaura Electric Co., Ltd. Chairman Taizo Ishizaka, who is colluding with American monopoly capitalists, and the "Southern Economic Roundtable" chaired by Hakodate Dock Chairman Hisaro Kano (an economic war criminal who invaded China and former president of Yokohama Specie Bank). In addition, Aiichiro Fujiyama (former chairman of Japan Airlines and chairman of the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry), who was recently released from purge, is also preparing to meet with the chairmen of chambers of commerce in Southeast Asian countries. In particular, Ichiro Ishikawa, chairman of the monopoly capitalist group "Keidanren," not only attempts to develop Southeast Asia's strategic resources, but also wants to carry out so-called extensive "economic cooperation" with Asian countries.

According to Kyodo News Agency, October 14th, Tokyo: "Keidanren" has requested Dulles to establish a "Japan-US Economic Cooperation Joint Committee." The association held a meeting at the Tokyo Industry Club on October 12th. Five officials from the US military headquarters in Japan's Diplomatic Bureau responsible for economic affairs, including Mr. Kaas, and Mr. Mueller, special assistant to the Economic Science Bureau, attended the meeting. On the Japanese side, more than a dozen people attended, including Teiichi Kawakita, president of the Industrial Bank of Japan, Kiichiro Sato, president of the Imperial Bank, and Takehiko Hamaguchi, president of the Bank of Tokyo. The meeting specifically discussed the organization of the joint committee and the development of Southeast Asia and other issues.

    美拼凑以日军为主的“盟军后备部队”
    妄图镇压强大的东南亚民族解放运动
    美国并策划通过日本财阀向东南亚进行经济侵略
    【新华社二十三日讯】华盛顿迟到消息：九月十二日起在华盛顿召开的美英法三国外长会议，曾计划在东南亚地区成立一支拥有九个陆军师和十五个航空大队的“盟军后备部队”，企图用来镇压日益扩大的东南亚民族解放运动。
    据悉：会议通过了美国国防部制订的一项关于使用日本、国民党残匪及其他亚洲傀儡军队的计划。该计划规定在东南亚建立所谓“盟军后备部队”，由美国一个师，英国一个师，法国两个师，日本三个师和国民党残匪两个师组成，合共为九个陆军师。最高司令将由“在亚洲有领导盟军经验”的美国人担任。此外，依照英法两国的要求，美国负责以重轰炸机和驱逐机组成十五个航空大队。这一计划已为莫里逊和舒曼所同意。
    依照美国的计划，“盟军后备部队”将用在所谓“东南亚最受威胁的地区”，目前以新加坡为该部队的集中地点。不久将有三个师驻扎在新加坡。
    该计划又规定，该部队今后将增加亚洲国家师团的数量，而相对地缩减西方国家师团的人数。预定到一九五二年六、七月间，该部队将再编入两个日本师及一个菲律宾师。
    在华盛顿会议上，美国代表表示：“对日和约”和“美日安全条约”签字后，美国及其盟国已有可能在朝鲜战场和其他战场公开使用日本的人力和物力。美国代表并对莫里逊和舒曼说明：把日本军队编入“盟军后备部队”是不需要很长时间的，因为美国军事当局早已估计到在东南亚有使用日军之必要，所以已经编入该部队的日本士兵已超过一万五千人，一俟训练完毕即开赴新加坡。据美国人说：这些已集中的日本士兵，大部在太平洋战争期间在东南亚各地作过战，中下级军官系由前日军军官选出，其中有许多人并曾在朝鲜战场直接研究过现代化战术。
    【新华社二十三日讯】美国正积极策划通过日本财阀向东南亚各地进行经济侵略，妄图垄断东南亚的贸易和资源。
    九月十五日出版的美国“商业周刊”承认：美国为了代替日本与中国的贸易，正在损害东南亚各国的情况下扶植日本工业。该周刊透露，美国为了应付对中国禁运在日本所引起的困难，已拟定了一个“东南亚计划”，其目的在于“完全改变日本的贸易方向”，使日本在东南亚“找寻新的市场”。这个巨大的野心的开发东南亚的美国计划，将特别注意于开发东南亚各国的铁、煤、锰之类的资源。该刊表示：“这个计划就是要日本供应采矿和运输装备，而日本则取得原料作为报酬。资金的筹措可能来自进出口银行和世界银行的贷款，也可能来自长期的日本贸易贷款。”
    据十月六日“朝日新闻”报道，首先着手向东南亚进行经济活动的日本财阀团体，是与美国独占资本家相勾结的东京芝浦电气公司董事长石坂泰三所领导的“日本经济再建协会”，和以函馆船坞会长加纳久朗（侵华经济战犯，前正金银行总裁）为委员长的“南方经济恳谈会”等。此外，最近被解除整肃的藤山爱一郎（前日本航空公司董事长、全国商会联合会会长）也准备与东南亚各国的商会会长集会。特别是独占资本家团体——“经济团体联合会”会长石川一郎，不仅企图开发东南亚的战略资源，并想与亚洲各国进行所谓广泛的“经济提携”。
    另据共同社十月十四日东京电称：“经济团体联合会”曾向杜勒斯要求设立“日美经济合作联合委员会”。该会曾在十月十二日在东京工业俱乐部举行会议，驻日美军总部外交局负责经济方面的官员卡氏、经济科学局特别助理穆勒等五人均出席参加，日本方面到会者有兴业银行行长川北祯一、帝国银行行长佐藤喜一郎、东京银行行长滨口雄彦等十数人。会上具体讨论了联合委员会的组织和开发东南亚等问题。
