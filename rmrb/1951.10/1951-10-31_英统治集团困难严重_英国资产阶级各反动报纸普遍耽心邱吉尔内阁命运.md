Xinhua News Agency, October 29th dispatch from London: The severe difficulties of the British ruling group have cast a huge shadow over the newly born Churchill cabinet.

The British bourgeois newspapers, including those of the Conservative Party, are generally worried about the fate of the Churchill government. The "Manchester Guardian" commented on the 27th: "Churchill is taking power not only when the country is facing enormous difficulties, but also when his government is in trouble." It is precisely for this reason that, according to Reuters, after the election results were announced, the newspapers that had been hyping up the Conservative Party before the election changed their tone to a low one. Reuters explained: "First, because the Conservative Party did not get enough majority to form a strong government; second, because the new government faces the same enormous economic difficulties as its predecessor." In fact, the difficulties of the new Churchill cabinet are by no means limited to the economic aspect, which the Conservative Party itself is well aware of. The Conservative Party's "Yorkshire Post" began its commentary on the 27th by emphasizing that the new cabinet members "encountered serious problems both at home and abroad, which have become increasingly serious in recent weeks." And the Conservative Party clearly has no magic formula for resolving Britain's fundamental political and economic crisis. An Associated Press dispatch from London on the 27th said: "Many people doubt whether the new Conservative government has better ways to deal with these problems."

The Conservative Party came to power in this election by relying on British voters' rejection of the Labor government, but even the Conservative Party itself does not dare to give this "victory" gained by luck too high an evaluation. The Conservative newspaper "Daily Telegraph" expressed regret in its commentary: "The Conservative Party has won, but not a great triumph." "In the course of events, British voters showed that their desire to get rid of the socialists (referring to Labor Party members) was stronger than their desire to give the Conservative Party a fully effective majority." The Yorkshire Post complained that this was "an unsatisfactory election result."

It is clear that in future British politics, it will be difficult for the Conservative Party to avoid government risks by relying on its eighteen-vote majority in the House of Commons. Therefore, just as the new cabinet was formed, Conservative Deputy Leader and new Deputy Prime Minister Eden warned that another election might be held soon. The British people's strong resistance to the Conservative Party's policy of inciting war, as well as attacks from the Labor opposition in Parliament in the future, will make it difficult for the Conservative government to gain stability. An Associated Press dispatch said that even now, "there is already talk of the Labor opposition's harassment, lengthy meetings, and political attrition warfare." It is precisely in view of this inevitable situation that the "Yorkshire Post" had to call in a low-key manner on the 27th for the members of the new parliament to "reduce disputes and hatred to a minimum."

    英统治集团困难严重
    英国资产阶级各反动报纸普遍耽心邱吉尔内阁命运
    【新华社二十九日讯】伦敦消息：英国统治集团的严重困难，使刚刚诞生的邱吉尔新阁就面临着巨大的暗影。
    英国资产阶级的报纸包括保守党的报纸在内，普遍为邱吉尔政府的命运耽心。“曼彻斯特卫报”二十七日评论说：“邱吉尔不但是在国家面临巨大困难的情况下，而且是在他的政府也处于困难的情况下接掌政权的。”正是因为这个缘故，据路透社透露，大选结果发表后，在大选前为保守党大吹大擂的各报，言论已一变而为低沉。路透社解释说：“第一，因为保守党没有得到能恃以组成强有力的政府的足够多数；第二，因为新政府所面临的经济困难和前任政府所遭遇到的同样巨大”。事实上，邱吉尔新阁的困难决不仅仅在于经济方面，这一点，保守党自己也很明白。保守党的“约克郡邮报”二十七日的评论一开始就着重表明，新阁阁员“遭遇到国内和国外两方面的严重问题，这些问题在最近几星期内已经日益严重”。而对于解决英国的政治与经济的根本性的危机，保守党显然并没有什么锦囊妙计。美联社伦敦二十七日消息说：“许多人怀疑新的保守党政府是否有更好的办法来处理这些问题。”
    保守党在这次大选中靠了英国选民对工党政府的唾弃而上台，但是这种徼幸得来的“胜利”甚至保守党自己都不敢给它多高的评价。保守党报纸“每日电讯报”在评论中表示遗憾说：“保守党得到了胜利，但不是大凯旋”。“在事态的发展中，英国选民表现出，他们要摆脱社会主义者（按指工党分子）的愿望比给予保守党以充分有效的多数的愿望来得更强烈”。约克郡邮报则埋怨这是“一个不令人满意的选举结果”。
    很明显，在未来的英国政治中，保守党要靠它在下院所握有的十八票多数来避免政府的风险是很困难的。因此，就在新阁刚刚组成的时候，保守党副领袖、新阁副首相艾登就警告说，不久以后可能要举行另一次大选。英国人民对于保守党煽动战争政策的强烈反抗以及今后议会中工党反对派的攻击，将使保守党政府很难得到安稳。美联社消息说，就在目前，“已经有人谈论着工党反对派的困扰、冗长的会议和政治消耗战了”。正是鉴于这种必然要出现的局面，“约克郡邮报”在二十七日不得不低调地呼吁新议会的议员们应该“把争执和仇恨减少到最低限度”。
