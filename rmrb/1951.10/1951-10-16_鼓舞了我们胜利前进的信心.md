    Inspired Our Confidence to Advance Victoriously
    People's Air Force National Day Observation Delegation: Liu Huanqi, Cui Hanqing, Fan Baoku, Zhang Wenxi, Liu Yaozong, Wang Hezhi
    On the eve of National Day, we saw Chairman Mao at Huairen Hall. This was the happiest thing for us, because our wish of many years had finally come true. That night, when Chairman Mao appeared in the hall looking so radiant, we were so excited that we almost jumped up. Everyone applauded enthusiastically and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" Some comrades who were shorter leaned on others' shoulders to see Chairman Mao. We all wanted to squeeze forward and shake hands with Chairman Mao to express the infinite respect of us Air Force comrades for him. Seeing Chairman Mao so healthy, we all felt that this was the greatest happiness for the Party and the people.
    At the National Day celebration on October 1st, we saw the brilliant achievements of the motherland's national defense and economic construction, and we saw the infinite love of people of all ethnic groups and from all walks of life for Chairman Mao. When the parade passed through Tiananmen Square, we saw with our own eyes an old man with white hair, just like everyone else, excitedly shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" and jumping. This scene was so moving. When the parade passed in front of the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army observation delegations, they applauded us warmly. The slogans "Long live the People's Liberation Army!" and "Long live the Volunteer Army!" resounded in every corner of the square, and flowers kept flying onto us. This fully demonstrated the people's love for their own army.
    What we saw and heard around National Day has made us more deeply aware of the greatness and loveliness of the motherland and the people, and has greatly inspired our confidence to advance victoriously. We vow to fight to the end to build a strong People's Air Force, consolidate national defense, and defend Eastern and world peace!

    鼓舞了我们胜利前进的信心
    人民空军国庆节观礼代表  刘焕岐  崔汉卿  樊宝库  张文喜  刘耀宗  王和芝
    国庆节前夕，我们在怀仁堂看见了毛主席。这是我们最高兴的事，因为多少年的愿望终于实现了。那天晚上，当毛主席精神奕奕地出现在会场上的时候，我们兴奋得几乎跳了起来。大家都一面热烈地鼓掌，一面高呼“毛主席万岁”。有些身材较矮的同志，扶在别人的肩上去看毛主席。我们都想挤上前去和毛主席握一握手，表示我们空军同志们对他的无限的敬意。我们看见毛主席那样健康，都觉得这是党和人民的最大幸福。
    在十月一日国庆节庆祝大会上，我们看见了祖国国防建设和经济建设的辉煌成就，看见了各族各界人民对毛主席的无限敬爱。在游行队伍经过天安门广场时，我们亲眼看见一个白发苍苍的老头子也和大家一样，兴奋得一面高呼毛主席万岁，一面跳。这情景是太动人了。游行队伍经过人民解放军、中国人民志愿军观礼代表的前面，都向我们热烈鼓掌，“解放军万岁！”“志愿军万岁！”的口号声响遍广场的每一个角落，鲜花也不断飞到我们身上，这充分表现了人民对自己军队的热爱。
    国庆节前后的所见所闻，使我们更深地认识了祖国和人民的伟大可爱，极大地鼓舞了我们胜利前进的信心。我们誓为建设强大的人民空军、巩固祖国国防、保卫东方与世界和平奋斗到底！
