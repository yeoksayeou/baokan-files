Xinhua News Agency, London, 28th. According to a report from British United Press in London: Pollitt, the General Secretary of the British Communist Party, issued a statement on the evening of the 26th, commenting on the results of the British general election and earnestly calling on the British working class to unite and defeat the Conservative Party's war plans. Pollitt said: "The Conservative policies pursued by the right-wing leaders of the Labor Party are the main reason for the Conservative Party's victory in this life-or-death election. However, the Labor Party leaders, even during the election campaign, continued to implement their policies of expanding armaments, threatening the Egyptian people, rearming German and Japanese fascists, conducting the Korean War, and obeying the American tycoons."

Pollitt said that due to the Conservative Party's majority in Parliament, a serious crisis has befallen the British people. However, as long as the labor movement unites and fights for a policy of peace, it can shatter the Conservative Party's war plans and force them to announce a new general election.

Pollitt said: "The main body of the working class is firmly prepared to resist the Conservative Party's attack. What is urgently needed now is for the British people to insist on demanding immediate Anglo-Soviet negotiations and to support this important demand by signing the declaration demanding the conclusion of a five-power peace pact." Pollitt called on all workers to demand "stopping the Korean War and the Malayan War, stopping the rearming of German and Japanese fascists, and stopping the arms expansion movement."

Pollitt continued: "The results of this election prove that the general masses of the labor movement cannot rely on the policies of the right-wing leaders. Labor Party members should demand that Labor Party members in Parliament wage a real struggle against the Conservative Party. They should launch a great new movement in the labor movement, defeat the disastrous policies of the right-wing leadership, and strive for a genuine socialist policy. The 'Defeat the Conservatives' committees in the factories, which played a very important role in this election, should continue to lead the struggle against any actions by the Conservative Party that endanger peace and attack the people's living standards."

Pollitt said: "The Communist Party can be proud of the role it played in this election." He said: "Communist Party candidates and Communists in constituencies where there were no Communist Party candidates have made the issue of peace the central issue in the election."

    波立特号召英国工人阶级团结起来
    坚决击败保守党的战争计划
    主张立即举行英苏谈判和停止侵朝战争
    【新华社二十八日讯】据电通社伦敦讯：英国共产党总书记波立特二十六日晚上发表声明，评论英国大选的结果，并且殷切地号召英国工人阶级团结起来，击败保守党的战争计划。波立特说：“工党右翼领袖们所奉行的保守党政策，是保守党在这次生死存亡的选举中获得胜利的主要原因。可是工党的领袖们，甚至是在竞选运动进行的时候，还是继续施行他们的扩张军备、威胁埃及人民、重新武装德日法西斯分子、进行朝鲜战争、服从美国富豪的政策。”
    波立特说：由于保守党在议会已获得多数，严重的危机临到了英国人民头上。然而，只要劳工运动团结起来，为争取和平政策而斗争，就能够粉碎保守党的战争计划，迫使他们宣布举行一次新的大选。
    波立特说：“工人阶级的主要部分，坚决地准备抵抗保守党的进攻，目前迫切地需要的就是：英国人民坚持要求立即举行英苏谈判，并在要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言上签名，以支持这个重要的要求。”波立特号召全体工人要求“停止朝鲜战争和马来亚战争，停止重新武装德日法西斯分子，停止扩张军备运动”。
    波立特接着说：“这次大选的结果证明：劳工运动的一般群众，不能依靠右翼领袖们的政策。工党党员们应该要求议会中的工党议员对保守党进行真正的斗争。他们应该在劳工运动中发动伟大的新的运动，击败右翼领导机构招致灾难的政策，争取真正的社会主义政策。在这次选举中起了很重要作用的各工厂的‘击败保守党’委员会，应该继续领导斗争，反对保守党任何危害和平并进攻人民生活水准的行动。”
    波立特说：“共产党可以因自己在这次选举中所起的作用而自豪。”他说：“共产党的候选人和在没有共产党候选人竞选的选区中的共产党人，都已使和平的问题成了选举中的中心问题。”
