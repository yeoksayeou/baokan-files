Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 19th: People of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are enthusiastically donating funds for airplanes and cannons to celebrate the anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the Korean War. As of October 15th, the people of all ethnic groups in the region had donated over 13.7 billion yuan, accounting for more than 57% of the six-month donation plan. Among them, the herdsmen of the Xilin Gol League have overfulfilled the entire donation plan. Although the Chahar League suffered from drought this year, people of all ethnic groups still increased their income by developing sideline production, and the donation reached more than half of the plan.

    During the donation campaign, workers in various parts of the region launched production competitions. Workers in factories in Manzhouli and Hailar not only donated all the increased production income, but also voluntarily worked an extra hour each day and donated all their wages. Farmers in various places also actively improved farming techniques and developed sideline production to increase income for donations. Farmers in Arukorqin Banner of Zhaowuda League organized 6,813 carts to transport salt to increase production income to complete the donation plan. Herdsmen in Chahar League, Huna League, and Xilin Gol League were also enthusiastic in donating. Balinyouqi Banner of Zhaowuda League has successfully completed the donation plan of 767.7 million yuan. Jirumuude, a herdsman from Baoligesumu (district) in the banner, alone donated 300,000 yuan and three head each of dairy cows, oxen, mules, and ponies. Herdsman Quedege of Xilin Gol League also donated his favorite horse. He said: "My dearest volunteers have been fighting abroad for a year. I donate my beloved horse so that the heroes can ride the horse, fight the American bandits more vigorously, more powerfully, and achieve greater victories."
