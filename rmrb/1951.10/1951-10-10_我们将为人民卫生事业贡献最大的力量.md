Respected Chairman Mao:

    We twenty-four people are all medical workers who worked at the Peking Union Medical College, a private institution controlled by American imperialism before liberation. We suffered greatly from the poisonous effects of American imperialist cultural aggression and the oppression and deception of the Kuomintang reactionary rule. At that time, we did not know our motherland, did not know the people, and even did not know ourselves. After liberation, thanks to your wise leadership and the education of the Communist Party, we opened our eyes, awakened, and saw the strength of the people and the greatness and loveliness of the motherland. Therefore, we hate our past ignorance and recognize the responsibilities that each of us should bear in the future.

    Since the Peking Union Medical College returned to the embrace of the motherland, there has been significant progress in all aspects. In April of this year, we improved our political consciousness, strengthened unity and friendship, and improved our working methods by signing a patriotic pact. In the great movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, we completed the treatment tasks assigned to us by our superiors. In order to donate airplanes and cannons, we donated a portion of our monthly salaries and also participated in the Sunday Resist America and Aid Korea donation clinic. In addition to regularly conducting teaching, diagnosis, and writing, we also helped various health agencies and schools in Beijing solve teaching and diagnostic problems. Although we have made some minor progress in our work, we are not satisfied with our current achievements. In order to welcome the National Day, we re-examined the patriotic pact. We assure you that we will work hard in the future in accordance with the health work policy of "serving workers, peasants, and soldiers"; respond to the government's call to strengthen the health cause in national defense construction; do a good job in the diagnosis and treatment of the wounded and sick and the training of advanced students; and step up the writing and translation of teaching materials. Wherever the motherland needs us, we will go there, determined to dedicate our greatest strength to the people's revolutionary cause.

            The Entire Staff of the Department of Radiology, Peking Union Medical College of China

### 我们将为人民卫生事业贡献最大的力量

    我们将为人民卫生事业贡献最大的力量敬爱的毛主席：
    我们二十四个人都是医务工作者，解放前就在美帝国主义控制下的北京私立协和医学院工作，受尽了美帝国主义文化侵略的毒害和国民党反动统治的压迫与蒙蔽；那时，我们不认识祖国、不认识人民，甚至不认识自己。解放以后，由于您的英明领导，和共产党的教育，我们才睁开了眼睛，觉悟过来，看见了人民的力量和祖国的伟大可爱，因而痛恨自己以往的无知，认清了今后每个人应该担负的责任。
    协和医学院自从回到祖国的怀抱以后，各方面都有了显著的进步。今年四月，我们通过订立爱国公约，提高了政治觉悟，加强了团结友爱，改进了工作方法。在伟大的抗美援朝爱国主义运动中，我们完成了上级给予我们的治疗任务；为了捐献飞机大炮，我们每月献出了薪金的一部分，还参加了星期日抗美援朝捐献门诊工作。除去经常进行教学、诊疗及著作外，并帮助北京市各卫生机关和学校解决教学和诊断上的问题。我们在工作中虽曾得到一点微小的进步，但我们并不满足现有的成绩。为了迎接国庆节，我们曾重新检查了爱国公约。我们向您保证：今后本着“面向工农兵”的卫生工作方针，努力工作；响应政府号召，加强国防建设中的卫生事业；做好伤病员的诊疗和对进修生的训练工作；并加紧著译教材。祖国那里需要我们，我们就到那里去，决心献出我们最大的力量，为人民革命事业奋斗。
