    The National Flag Should Not Be Drawn Incorrectly
    The national flag is a symbol representing our country. Educating the broad masses of people to cherish and respect our national flag is one of the important contents of our patriotic education for the people. Therefore, the style of the national flag has absolute solemnity and cannot be arbitrarily changed. In the National Day Commemorative Special Issue, No. 40, of the "Shanxi Pictorial," a propaganda painting entitled "Advancing Victoriously Under the Leadership of Chairman Mao!" was published. However, only three stars were drawn on the national flag (one large star and two small stars). Since the flag was not being blown by the wind, obscuring the other two stars, the omission of two small five-pointed stars is clearly a political error that cannot be allowed. "Shanxi Pictorial" demonstrated irresponsibility and a lack of seriousness in its work style when publishing this picture, which is very inappropriate.

    不应画错国旗
    国旗是代表我们国家的标志。教育广大人民群众爱护和尊重我们的国旗，是我们向人民群众进行爱国主义教育的重要内容之一。因之国旗的样式具有绝对的严肃性，不能任意更改的。山西画报第四十期国庆纪念专刊上，刊登了一张以“在毛主席领导下胜利前进！”为题的宣传画，国旗上面却只画了三颗星（一颗大星，两颗小星），这面旗既然不是被风卷起，遮没了其它两颗星，那么少画了两颗小五角星，便显然是一种不能被允许的政治错误了。“山西画报”在刊登这幅图画时，表现了编辑工作的不负责任和不严肃的工作作风，是很不应该的。
