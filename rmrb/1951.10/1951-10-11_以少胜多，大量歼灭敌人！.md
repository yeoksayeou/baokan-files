    Defeat the Enemy with Fewer Troops, Annihilate Large Numbers!
    People's Volunteer Army Special-Class Hero Chen San
    Early this year, after I joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, we began to engage with the enemy north of the Imjin River. At that time, my comrades and I couldn't wait to wipe out all the enemies. After the battle unfolded, we quickly broke through the enemy's two lines of defense and seized an enemy hilltop.
    At daybreak, my superior sent me and a new soldier, Cao Yubao, to hold this hilltop. I immediately worked with Cao Yubao to find a good terrain for concealed defense. This place was not far from the enemy's front line, and there were three communication trenches connecting to us. It would be very disadvantageous for us if the enemy came along these communication trenches, but for the safety of our motherland and to avenge the Korean people, we had to hold on. Before long, the enemy did start attacking. Before the attack, four planes bombed us randomly, followed by artillery shelling for a long time. The soil on our position turned black. But Cao Yubao and I remained calm and stayed in our fortifications. After a short while, more than forty enemies came at once, rushing up along the three communication trenches. When the enemy got close, I first used my machine gun to sweep the enemies in the first communication trench, which was very satisfying. Many enemies fell. After finishing off the first group of enemies, I immediately switched to the second machine gun and swept the second group of enemies happily. As soon as the second group was finished, the third group of enemies arrived. My machine gun fired again. The machine gun sweeping the enemy was like herding sheep. The enemies died, and those who didn't rolled down the mountain along the communication trenches.
    After the first enemy attack was repelled by us two, it wasn't long before the enemy's second attack came. This time, seven planes came first, throwing gasoline bombs and firing artillery wildly. The whole hilltop was on fire, and even my clothes caught fire. I took off my clothes immediately. Looking down, I realized that this time the enemy coming up was twice as many as the first time. As soon as the enemy approached, they threw grenades at us two, but all the grenades thrown at us were caught and thrown back. This time, there were too many enemies. Firing machine guns was not enough. Cao Yubao and I picked up flying mines and grenades and threw a large pile of them. The enemies were blown up and rolled around on the ground. The American devils behind saw the devils in front dying and getting injured and did not dare to rush up. They turned around to run, but were forced by their commander to attack us in three directions again. It took more than an hour to completely drive the enemy back. This time we calculated that we two had killed more than forty enemies.
    After these two enemy attacks were repelled by us, our platoon deputy ran from the back of the mountain. He patted me on the shoulder and said, "We are communists. This high ground is the most forward哨 of our company. You must hold this position no matter what!" I said to the platoon deputy, "Don't worry! The position remains as long as I am here!" At that time, I only asked the platoon deputy to send us more flying mines. Not long after the platoon deputy left, someone sent more than twenty flying mines. Cao Yubao was extremely happy to see the flying mines being delivered. He said to me, "Old Chen, let's do it! I will load as many bullets as you fire."
    While we were sorting out grenades and bullets, suddenly more than a dozen enemy planes came to bomb and strafe, and the enemy continued to fire artillery for a long time. After that, the enemy's infantry began their third attack. This time, more than a hundred enemies came at once. But Cao Yubao and I continuously gave the enemy nine flying mines. Most of the enemies in front were killed by the explosion, and those who were not dead hurriedly turned around and retreated. At this time, it was getting dark.
    That day, from morning till night, the enemy attacked with more than two hundred people in succession. We two defeated them in this way, killed more than eighty enemies, and held the position. After dark, our large troops behind began to attack the enemy. Afterwards, we kept chasing the enemy, fighting across the Imjin River and then across the Han River.
    Now I have been awarded the title of "Special-Class Hero." These are all given to me by the Party. I feel very honored. This time when I returned to the motherland and saw the great construction of the motherland, I felt even more that the motherland is lovable. In the future, I will continue to contribute everything I have to defend the motherland. (Attached photo)

    以少胜多，大量歼灭敌人！
    人民志愿军特等功臣  陈三
    今年年初，我参加了中国人民志愿军后，在临津江北面，我们开始同敌人接触。我和我的战友们，这时候都恨不得把敌人全部消灭。战斗展开后，我们很快就突破敌人的两道防线，夺取了敌人一个山头。
    天刚亮，上级派我同一个新战士曹玉保守住这个山头，我马上同曹玉保找了一个好的地形来隐蔽坚守。这里离前面敌人阵地不远，而且敌人还有三条交通沟通到我们这里，如果敌人顺这些交通沟来，对我们是很不利的，可是为了祖国的安全，为了给朝鲜人民报仇，我们必须坚守。没有多长时间，敌人果然开始进攻了。进攻之前，先来四架飞机向我们乱炸，接着又用大炮轰，打了很长时间，我们阵地的泥土都打黑了。但曹玉保和我，都很镇定地守在工事里。等了不多时间，敌人一下就来了四十多个，正是顺着三条交通沟往上冲。等敌人接近的时候，我就首先用机枪对准第一条交通沟里面的敌人扫，打得可痛快啦，敌人倒下很多。打完了第一路敌人，我又马上换第二挺机枪，把第二路的敌人扫个痛快。第二路刚打完，第三路的敌人也赶来了。我的机枪又打啦，机枪扫敌人就好像赶绵羊一样，敌人死的死，不死的都顺着交通壕滚下山去。
    第一次敌人被我们两个人打退以后，没多长时间，敌人的第二次攻击又来啦。这次是先来七架飞机，乱扔汽油弹，乱打炮，整个山头都烧着了，连我的衣服也着了火，我马上脱了衣服。往下面一看，才知道这次冲上来的敌人比第一次多了一倍。敌人一接近就向我们两个人扔手榴弹，但所扔过来的手榴弹都被我们抓起来扔回去。敌人这次来得太多了，打机枪还是有点不够过瘾，我和曹玉保拿起飞雷和手榴弹，扔了一大堆过去。敌人被我们炸得随地乱滚。后面的美国鬼子看见了前面鬼子死的死，伤的伤，不敢冲上来，回头就想跑，但又被他们的指挥官强迫着再分三路向我们进攻。直打了一个多钟头，敌人才完全被打退回去。这次我们计算，我们两个人打死了四十多个敌人。
    这两次敌人的攻击被我们打退以后，我们的排副从后山跑来，他拍着我的肩膀说：“咱是共产党员，这个高地是咱们连的最前哨，你无论如何要守住这个阵地！”我对排副说：“放心吧！人在阵地在！”当时我只要求排副给我们多送些飞雷来。排副走了没多时间，就派人送来了二十多个飞雷，曹玉保看见飞雷送来了，高兴得了不得，他对我说：“老陈，干吧！你打多少子弹我给你压多少子弹。”
    我们正整理手榴弹和子弹的时候，突然来了十几架敌机轰炸扫射，并且敌人照样又用大炮打了很长时间。之后敌人的步兵就开始了第三次进攻。这次敌人一来就是百十来个人。但是我和曹玉保两个人连续给敌人吃了九个飞雷。前面的敌人大部分都被炸死了，没有死的忙转头退了回去。这时天也快黑了。
    这一天从早到晚，敌人先后以两百多人来攻击，我们两个人就这样打败了他们，打死了敌人八十多个，守住了阵地。天黑以后，我们后面的大部队就向敌人开始进攻了。以后我们就一直是追击着敌人，打过临津江，又打过了汉江。
    现在我荣获“特等功臣”的称号。这些都是党给我的，我觉得很光荣，我这次回到祖国，看见祖国的伟大建设，我更觉得祖国的可爱。今后我决继续把我的一切贡献出来，保卫祖国。（附图片）
