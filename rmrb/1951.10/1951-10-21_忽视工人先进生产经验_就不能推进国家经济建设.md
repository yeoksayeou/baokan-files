    Ignoring Workers' Advanced Production Experience
    Hinders National Economic Construction

    Editor:

    Zhang Chen, a leading cadre of the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Mill, has made the mistake of disregarding and refusing to promote workers' advanced production experience. As the People's Daily "Brief Commentary on Party Life" pointed out, this is the result of his lack of the idea of relying on the working class to run enterprises well. Under the rule of bureaucratic capital, workers were slaves of machines; after liberation, workers were transformed from slaves into masters, their production enthusiasm greatly increased, and many advanced elements emerged, creating much advanced production experience. Every factory leading cadre should pay close attention to summarizing these advanced experiences and vigorously promote them, so as to improve the quality and quantity of production and continuously advance the country's economic construction. If a factory leading cadre ignores this, he will inevitably make serious mistakes. The leading cadre of Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Mill is an example. It is hoped that the higher-level leading organs of the factory will immediately go deep into the factory to inspect the work.

### 忽视工人先进生产经验  就不能推进国家经济建设

    忽视工人先进生产经验
    就不能推进国家经济建设编辑同志：
    国营天津棉纺第二厂领导干部张忱，犯了漠视和拒绝推广工人先进生产经验的错误。正如人民日报“党的生活简评”中所说的，这是他缺乏依靠工人阶级办好企业的思想的结果。在官僚资本统治下，工人是机器的奴隶；解放后，工人由奴隶变成了主人，生产热情大大提高，出现了许多先进分子，创造了许多先进的生产经验。每个工厂领导干部，都应十分注意总结这些先进经验，大力推广这些经验，这样才能提高生产质量和数量，把国家的经济建设不断地向前推进。如果一个工厂领导干部忽视这一点，必然会犯严重的错误。天津棉纺二厂的领导干部就是一个例子。希望该厂上级领导机关，立即深入该厂检查工作。
