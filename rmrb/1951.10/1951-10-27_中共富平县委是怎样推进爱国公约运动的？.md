How the CCP Fuping County Committee Promoted the Patriotic Pact Movement?

The Patriotic Pact movement in Fuping County, Shaanxi Province, began on May 1 this year. The CCP Fuping County Committee did not fully recognize the importance of promoting the Patriotic Pact at that time. Until July 20, it only made general arrangements without in-depth inspections and specific guidance. Cadres regarded the formulation of Patriotic Pacts as a burden, believing that it would hinder central work. Most district and township cadres did not know how to lead the masses in formulating Patriotic Pacts; the masses did not understand the rationale behind formulating Patriotic Pacts, treating it as a "public matter." A few people even mistakenly believed that formulating Patriotic Pacts was the government putting a "bridle" and establishing "regulations" for them. In short, from government offices to rural areas, only a few places and units formulated Patriotic Pacts; even those that did were merely formalities.

On July 20, the county held a representative meeting for Resisting America and Aiding Korea. 120 representatives and government cadres listened to the reports from the delegation to Korea and held two days of discussions. The representatives and participating cadres gained a further understanding of promoting the Patriotic Pact. The representatives returned to the countryside and widely conveyed the spirit of the meeting. The county committee also made two arrangements at the district secretary and district head meetings, and rural areas began to formulate or revise Patriotic Pacts. However, most district and township cadres still did not fully recognize the importance of formulating Patriotic Pacts, so they lacked awareness in implementing the resolutions. When leading the masses in formulating Patriotic Pacts, they adopted a method of acting on behalf of the masses. As a result, most of the Patriotic Pacts formulated were just empty slogans. Some places even turned the pacts into regulations and rules to restrain and punish the masses. Not only did the cadres find it troublesome, but it also caused doubts among the masses. When the county committee sent cadres to the first and third districts for inspection on August 15, most of the masses did not know why they were formulating Patriotic Pacts. Some of them said, "Our village's Patriotic Pact was formulated by the cadres, I don't know anything about it." Some people asked cadres "How much does it cost to formulate a Patriotic Pact?" In response to these serious situations, the county committee issued two circulars, and the Xi'an Masses Daily also published articles criticizing the ninth township of the third district. This further aroused the attention of cadres in various districts and townships, and the work of inspecting Patriotic Pacts began to deepen further.

In order to fundamentally overcome the formalism in Patriotic Pacts, the county committee held a county committee meeting at the end of August for a comprehensive and in-depth study and determined that "promoting Patriotic Pacts" would be the first central task in September, instructing all levels of leadership organs to promote all work by formulating good Patriotic Pacts. In addition to making arrangements at the district party secretary and district head meetings, the first county-wide propaganda meeting was held in early September to study relevant documents on formulating Patriotic Pacts and conduct in-depth discussions. Various districts and townships held meetings for propagandists, reading group leaders, cadres, and various mass meetings. Township blackboard newspapers, reading groups, and propagandists cooperated to carry out more in-depth and extensive propaganda. The county and district leading organs attached great importance to this, and after study, the general cadres also clearly understood the significance of formulating Patriotic Pacts and the methods of leading the masses to formulate Patriotic Pacts. The responsible comrades of various government offices and mass organizations personally presided over cadre meetings, earnestly revised the Patriotic Pacts of their respective units through democratic discussions. The district party secretaries and district heads of various districts personally went to the countryside to focus on leading the masses to formulate and revise Patriotic Pacts. The county committee organized working groups to conduct key inspections. After a series of work, the broad masses of the people understood the rationale behind formulating Patriotic Pacts. Most areas adopted methods of mass deliberation and democratic discussion to formulate practical and feasible Patriotic Pacts. At the same time, a movement to greet National Day with practical actions to ensure the implementation of Patriotic Pacts was launched throughout the county. According to inspections, as of October 1, 60 percent of families in rural areas throughout the county had formulated Patriotic Pacts.

Through the education of the Patriotic Pact, the patriotic ideology of the broad masses of peasants has generally improved. After the land reform, many peasants only cared about production and did not care about politics and didn't attend meetings; now it is: "They come as soon as they hear the gong and don't leave until the meeting is over." The patriotic enthusiasm of the peasants has been poured into all aspects of rural work. When paying the summer public grain, the peasants launched a upsurge of handing in "patriotic grain" and "Resist America and Aid Korea grain". Not only was the grain requisition task overfulfilled, but the outstanding grain from 1949 and 1950 was also collected at the same time. Because the masses enthusiastically delivered grain, the warehouse cadres were too busy to handle it. More than 350 peasants in the county voluntarily organized dozens of warehouse protection teams to take turns guarding the warehouses scattered in the rural wilderness, preventing unexpected losses. This demonstrated the peasants' concern for national wealth and the great change in the thinking of the peasant masses. Now most peasants have added new content to the Patriotic Pact: selecting cotton seeds, accumulating more manure, cultivating cotton fields well in autumn and winter, expanding cotton fields, ensuring the needs of the country, etc. Chengbu Village, the seventh township of the third district, planted 80 mu of cotton this year and plans to plant 150 mu next year. The cotton farmers have also generally agreed to respond to the government's call to sell all the cotton to the state, except for what their families need, and to do so as soon as it is dried, ginned, and sold. On National Day, cotton farmers in various villages went to the cooperative to sell cotton one after another as their gift to National Day. The county cooperative purchased 200,057 catties of new cotton in six days in the three cotton-producing areas. The peasants' patriotic enthusiasm is also reflected in the work of preferential treatment. This autumn, when planting wheat, the mutual aid teams generally and automatically gave priority to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers without labor power and planted well. The families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers are loved and respected by the broad masses of the people in the countryside. Liu Zhankui, a rural porter, carried things for a soldier's family 18 li away from the city. When he heard that it was a soldier's family, he refused to charge a fee. The soldier's family insisted on giving him money. After pulling for a long time, he only accepted half the money. Fan Gui'er and Qiao Yunyan, women from the ninth township of the third district, helped the soldier's family weave eight feet of cloth.

Vivid facts have educated cadres at all levels and the broad masses of peasants. Many cadres said: "I can now see the importance of formulating a good Patriotic Pact. The peasants' patriotic enthusiasm has promoted the smooth development of all work." The peasants said: "We used to think that formulating Patriotic Pacts was for the government! Now we know that formulating Patriotic Pacts is for the country and also for ourselves. Everyone loves the country, the country is prosperous and strong, and we can live a safe and secure life!" The peasants pasted their Patriotic Pacts under the portrait of Chairman Mao, indicating that they would support Chairman Mao with actions to implement the Patriotic Pacts. Xie Suo'er, a peasant in the fourth district, accompanies the portrait of Chairman Mao for a while every night. He said: "When I am working in the fields, I often think of the Patriotic Pact. If I don't act in accordance with the pact, I feel that I can't go home to see Chairman Mao (referring to the portrait of Chairman Mao)."

    中共富平县委是怎样推进爱国公约运动的？
    中共富平县委书记  刘文忠
    宣传部长  任玉珊
    陕西省富平县推行爱国公约运动是从今年五月一日开始的。中共富平县委当时对推行爱国公约的重要意义认识不足，直至七月二十日以前只作了一般布置，没有深入检查和具体指导。干部把订立爱国公约当作负担，认为会妨碍中心工作。多数区、乡干部不懂得如何领导群众订立爱国公约；群众不明白订爱国公约的道理，把订立爱国公约当作“公事”。少数人还错误地认为订立爱国公约是政府给自己挽“笼头”、立“法规”。总之，从机关到农村，只有很少的地方和单位订立了爱国公约；有的虽然订立了，也都流于形式。
    七月二十日全县召开了抗美援朝代表会，一百二十名代表及机关干部听了赴朝慰问团的传达报告，进行了两天的讨论。代表和与会的干部对推行爱国公约有了进一步的认识。代表回到农村，普遍作了传达，县委又在区书、区长会议上作过两次布置，农村才开始订立或修订爱国公约。由于那时区、乡干部多半还对订立爱国公约的重要性认识不足，他们在执行决议时缺乏自觉性；在领导群众订立爱国公约时，则采取包办代替的方法。结果，订出的爱国公约，绝大部分是几条空洞的口号。有些地方订的公约，反成了约束、处罚群众的条例和规则。不仅干部认为是麻烦，也引起了群众的疑惑。县委八月十五日派干部到一、三区进行检查时，大部群众不知为啥订爱国公约，他们有的说：“我村的爱国公约是干部订的，我不知道。”有些群众问干部“订一份爱国公约多少钱”。针对这些严重情况，县委曾发出两次通报，西安群众日报也曾登出批评三区九乡的稿件，这才更引起了各区、乡干部的重视，检查爱国公约的工作才开始进一步地深入下去。
    为从根本上克服爱国公约的形式主义偏向，县委于八月底召开县委会议，作了全面深刻的研究，并确定“推行爱国公约”为九月份第一项中心工作，指示各级领导机关应以订好爱国公约来推动各项工作。除在区委书记、区长会议上布置外，九月初又召开第一次全县宣传会议，学习订立爱国公约的有关文件，并作了深刻讨论。各区、乡召开了宣传员、读报组长、干部会议，和各种群众会。各乡黑板报、读报组、宣传员配合进行了比较深入广泛的宣传。县区领导机关一致重视，一般干部经过学习，也明确认识了订立爱国公约的意义和领导群众订立爱国公约的方法。各机关、群众团体的负责同志，亲自主持干部会议，经过民主讨论，认真修订了本单位的爱国公约。各区区委书记、区长亲自下乡有重点地领导群众订立与修订爱国公约。县委组织工作组进行重点检查。经过一连串的工作后，广大群众明白了订立爱国公约的道理，多数地区用群众酝酿，民主讨论的方法，订出了切实可行的爱国公约。同时，并在全县范围展开了以保证执行爱国公约的实际行动迎接国庆节的运动。据检查，截至十月一日，全县各地农村中有百分之六十的家庭都订了爱国公约。
    通过爱国公约的教育，广大农民群众的爱国主义思想普遍提高了一步。土地改革后，曾有不少农民光顾生产，不问政治，开会不到；现在是：“听见锣声就到，会不闭不走”。农民的爱国热情，贯注到农村工作的各个方面了。缴夏季公粮时，农民们掀起交“爱国粮”、“抗美援朝粮”的热潮，征粮任务不仅超额完成，而且同时收齐了一九四九年、一九五○年的尾欠粮。因群众送粮踊跃，使仓库干部忙不过来。全县有三百五十余个农民，自愿组织起数十个护仓小组轮流守护，使分散在农村旷野的粮仓未受意外损失。这表现了农民对国家财富的关心，也表现出农民群众思想的重大变化。现在多数农民已在爱国公约上补充了新的内容：选择棉种，多积粪，秋冬耕好棉田，扩大棉田，保证国家的需要等等。三区七乡程堡村，今年种棉八十亩，明年计划种一百五十亩。棉农们还普遍订了响应政府号召，除自己家庭所需外，把全部棉花卖给国家，做到随晒、随轧、随卖。国庆节各村棉农更纷纷到合作社卖花，作为自己对国庆节的献礼，县合作社六天内，在三个产棉区即收购新花二十万零五十七斤。农民的爱国热情，还表现在优抚工作上，今秋种麦，互助组普遍自动给无劳动力的烈军属先种，并种得好。烈军属在农村中，受到广大群众的爱戴和尊敬。农村搬运工刘占魁，给距城十八里的一位军属搬运东西，听说是军属，不收运费；军属非给他钱不可，拉扯了半天，才收了一半钱。三区九乡妇女范贵儿、乔云雁等帮助军属织了八丈布。
    生动的事实教育了各级干部和广大农民群众。不少干部说：“我现在才看清订好爱国公约的重要，农民爱国的热情，推动了一切工作的顺利开展。”农民们说：“以前认为订爱国公约，是给政府订哩！现在知道订爱国公约，是为了国家也是为了自己。人人爱国，国家富强，好日子才过得保险哩！”农民们把自己的爱国公约贴在毛主席像的下面，表示以执行爱国公约的行动，来拥护毛主席。四区农民谢锁儿每天晚上，都要陪毛主席像坐一会。他说：“在地里干活时，我常想起爱国公约，如果没按公约办事，我觉得无法回家见毛主席（指毛主席像）。”
