    Cultural Life Brief Comments
    Oppose Plagiarism

    Copying other people's works from newspapers and periodicals and publishing them in other newspapers and periodicals to obtain personal fame and gain is a lack of moral behavior. Northeast Literature and Art, Northwest Literature and Art, Northern Anhui Literature and Art, Northern Jiangsu Literature and Art, Beijing Guangming Daily, Shanghai Wenhui Daily and other newspapers and periodicals have published plagiarized works. These plagiarized works come in various forms: some copy exactly, without changing the title or punctuation; some only change the title and individual words of other people's works; some copy a certain paragraph or several paragraphs of other people's works and put them in their own works; and some rewrite other people's articles, slightly deleting or adding content, and then pass them off as their own works. There is also a kind of plagiarism method, that is, writing "Original by so-and-so, adapted by so-and-so" or "Written by so-and-so (i.e., the name of the copier), adapted from the novel (or poem, drama...) by so-and-so (i.e., the name of the original author)" in front of the work. In fact, the adapted work is no different from the original or has very little difference. Recently, a reader of this newspaper, Wang Yanfei, wrote a letter exposing this phenomenon. His play "Rotten Beef" (published in "Plain Literature and Art") was printed into a book "Niu'er's Illness" by Liu Zhengping using the latter method (published by Beijing Xinhua Bookstore, one of the "Books for Workers and Peasants" series). Although the cover of the book says "Original by Wang Xinyou (Wang Yanfei's pen name), adapted by Liu Zhengping," most of the book, except for individual words and phrases, is the same as the original. All of these acts of plagiarism are bad and this bad style should be corrected.

    文化生活简评
    反对抄袭行为
    将报刊上别人的作品抄袭下来，发表在另外的报刊上，以获取个人的名利，是一种缺乏道德的行为。东北文艺、西北文艺、皖北文艺、苏北文艺、北京光明日报、上海文汇报等报刊上都曾发见过抄袭的作品。这些抄袭作品的形式有各种各样：有的连题目、标点符号都一点没有变换地照抄，有的仅仅改动别人作品的题目和个别的字，有的把别人作品的某一段或某几段抄下来放在自己的作品里，还有把别人的文章改头换面，略加删改或增添，就冒充自己的作品。另外还有一种抄袭方法，即在作品前面写上“某某原作、某某改编”，“某某（即抄者姓名）作，据某某（即原作者姓名）小说（或诗歌、戏剧……）改编”等字样，实际上这改编后的作品与原作竟没有差别或差别很少。最近本报读者王燕飞来信揭露这一现象，他的剧本“烂牛肉”（曾在“平原文艺”发表）即被刘正平用后一种方法印成书籍“牛儿的病”（北京新华书店出版、“工农的书”丛刊之一）。虽然在书的封面上印着“王辛酉（王燕飞笔名）原作，刘正平改编”等字，但书中除个别词句外，绝大部分和原作相同。以上这些抄袭行为都是不好的，应该纠正这种不良作风。
