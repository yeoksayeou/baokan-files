    Agricultural Production Can Only Be Continuously Improved With the Help of the Working Class
    Zhang Xishun, Agricultural Labor Model of Hebei Province
    I am from Niangniangmiao Village, Daming County, Hebei Province. Our village had another bumper harvest this year. Not to mention anything else, we harvested an average of more than 300 jin of millet per mu. The mutual aid group I led trial-planted two mu of high-yield millet and harvested 2,600 jin, an average of 1,300 jin per mu. After the bumper harvest, we held a meeting to study the reasons for the harvest. Everyone believed that in addition to the leadership and help of the People's Government, another important reason was that the new waterwheels, horse-drawn plows, weeding machines, and sprayers helped us a lot in improving production. Everyone felt that these new agricultural tools were really effective when working. For example, the horse-drawn plow is light and easy to hold, plows deeply, and turns the soil evenly. Plowing once is equivalent to plowing twice with a wooden plow.

    This time when I came to Beijing, I first visited the steel factory, and then I visited the agricultural production materials hall of the urban-rural materials exchange exhibition in Tianjin. I learned that the reason why the new agricultural tools are so effective is that the working-class brothers stood in the fire and drilled in the smoke, painstakingly sweating to manufacture them for us. This made me understand a problem in my mind: I originally thought that it was hard enough for farmers to work in the hot weather, with the sun scorching their heads and the hot soil burning their feet. I didn't expect that the working-class brothers were even more hardworking than us. I saw them drilling under the red-hot and smoky boilers, the machines roaring louder than thunder, and the black smoke billowing darker than dark clouds, but the worker comrades were not flustered at all and kept working diligently and carefully without stopping for a moment. They are like this every day, more than 360 days a year. What about us farmers? If we compare ourselves with the working-class brothers, I really feel that we are not putting in enough effort in our labor. However, the working-class brothers did not show any signs of arrogance or conceit. Every time we visited a factory, the worker comrades warmly welcomed us and humbly asked for our opinions, asking us whether the new agricultural tools were useful or not. They wanted us to offer suggestions for improvement. I was moved from the bottom of my heart when I heard this. The working class is indeed the leader in transforming the world. If we farmers want to continuously improve agricultural production, we can only do it under the leadership and help of the working class. This time, I realized this point. When I return to the village, I must tell all the farmers in the village so that they can also realize this point. Because only when we realize this point can our workers and peasants unite more closely and work harder to develop industrial and agricultural production.

    只有在工人阶级帮助下农业生产才能不断提高
    河北省农业劳动模范  张希舜
    我是河北省大名县娘娘庙村人。我们村的庄稼今年又丰收了。不说别的，光谷子每亩平均收到三百多斤。我领导的互助组试种了二亩丰产谷，就收了两千六百斤，平均每亩收一千三百斤。丰收后，我们大伙儿开了一个会，研究丰收的原因，大家认为除人民政府的领导和帮助以外，还有一个重要原因，就是：新水车、马拉犁、锄草机、喷雾器对我们提高生产帮助不小。大家都感到这些新式农具在干活时实在得劲。象马拉犁，又轻巧，又好扶，耕得深，翻土匀，犁一遍，可顶木犁犁两遍。
    这回到了北京，先参观了钢铁厂，到天津又参观了城乡物资交流展览会的农业生产资料馆，我才知道新式农具所以用的得劲，原来是工人老大哥站在火里，钻在烟里，费心流汗帮我们制造出来的。这使我在思想上明白了一个问题：原来我想着，农民在热天里劳动，太阳晒着顶心，热土烧着脚心就够辛苦了，没想到工人老大哥比我们更辛苦；我看到他们钻在红火黑烟的锅炉下，机器叫的比打雷还响，黑烟冒的比乌云还黑，可是工人同志们一点也不慌，一会也不停，都是认真仔细地努力工作。一年三百六十多天，天天都是这样。我们农民呢？要是和工人老大哥来相比，我真感到我们在劳动上实在是出力太小了。可是工人老大哥没有一点骄傲自大的表示，我们每到一处工厂参观，工人同志都是火热热地招待我们，还虚心征求我们意见，问我们新式农具管用不管用。要我们提改进意见。我听了从心眼里都感动了。工人阶级的确是改造世界的带头人，我们农民要想不断提高农业生产，只有在工人阶级领导和帮助下才能办到。这次，我认识了这一点，回到村里一定要告诉全村农民，使他们也都认识到这一点。因为只有认识了这一点，我们工农才能团结得更紧密，才能更好地为发展工农业生产努力。
