    People's Volunteer Army Soldiers Talk About National Construction
       Xia Guang
    On a chilly morning after the National Day of the Motherland, I went to the first platoon of the second company of a certain unit of the People's Volunteer Army, where the soldiers were sitting on the kang discussing the great achievements of the motherland's construction over the past two years since its founding. In the middle of the kang was a small hexagonal矮table, with a pot of boiling water steaming on it; everyone's face showed a look of joy and excitement. Some of these soldiers had been away from the motherland for more than ten months, and the latest had been away for more than half a year. They were not very clear about the situation of the motherland's construction, but they could all draw conclusions based on the supplies they had recently received at the front line, and realized that the achievements of the motherland's construction were developing rapidly, and therefore felt even more that the motherland was lovable.
    In August, it was the rainy season in Korea, and some roads and bridges were washed away by the water, so there were difficulties. However, the soldiers at the front still ate the grain transported from the motherland, and did not go hungry for a single meal; and they also ate canned food, peanuts, and dried shrimp and other non-staple foods, and their lives were much better than in the winter of last year. Regarding this fact, soldier Liu Degui said well: "This shows how strong the motherland's strength is!"
    On the kang of the first squad, thick cotton clothes were neatly arranged, which had just been issued, and the soldiers were particularly satisfied and fond of them. Speaking of these, the soldiers were very excited. This year's cotton clothes are finer in cloth than last year's, better in quality, and the cotton is also particularly thick. Soldier Zhao Qingshu said: "This is the result of the motherland's construction. I heard from the instructor that 150,000 farmers in the Northeast entered factories last year. From this, it seems that the motherland's industry has developed greatly." Third Squad Leader He Chengjun said: "If industry develops, the motherland will be strong."
    The soldiers praised the material and style of the cotton clothes, and thanked Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland for their care and love. Soldier Gao Qingsheng said: "This year's cotton clothes are sewn tightly, and a layer of cloth is also sewn on the buttocks. This is done according to our needs and for our sake." At this time, several soldiers scrambled to say: "Chairman Mao and the people at home are really thinking too carefully! Each set of cotton clothes also comes with a sewing kit, which contains a piece of cloth, two needles, and a bundle of yellow thread." "There is also insecticidal powder produced in Tianjin." "There are also first-aid kits and triangular bandages, which are really suitable for the needs of the front line." "There are also letters of appreciation..." As he spoke, he shouted... Squad Leader Yao Shengzhong immediately took out a letter of appreciation from worker Chen A'gen of a factory in Shanghai from his pocket. The letter said: "Volunteer Army comrades are standing on the front line of the struggle to defend the motherland and defend world peace, and are fighting against the American invaders. Our worker brothers fully support you. If you need anything, please tell us and we will solve it for you. We hope that you will bravely kill the enemy and drive the American devils out of Korea as soon as possible!"
    While they were talking, American planes roared through the sky. Communist Youth League member Zhang Jiugao glanced at them contemptuously and said: "The enemy boasted about 'air superiority' in the Kaesong talks, what's so great about it? No matter how crazy it is, with the support of the motherland's strong forces, we will definitely defeat it!"

    人民志愿军战士谈祖国建设
       夏光
    祖国国庆节后的一个寒气袭人的清早，我到人民志愿军某部二连一排去，战士们正坐在炕上座谈祖国建国两年来建设的伟大成就。炕当中放着一张小小的六角矮桌，桌上一盆开水腾腾地冒着热气；每人的脸上都呈现出愉快和兴奋的神色。这些战士离开祖国最早的已有十个多月，最迟的也有半年多了。他们对祖国建设的情况是不十分明了的，但他们都能根据最近在前线得到的供应品得出结论，认识到祖国的建设成就正一日千里地发展，因此更感到祖国的可爱了。
    八月里，朝鲜正是雨季，有些公路和桥梁都被水冲坏了，困难是有的。但是前线的战士们仍然吃得上从祖国运来的粮食，没有挨过一顿饿；而且还吃得上罐头、花生米和虾米等副食品，生活比去年冬季还好得多。对于这一事实，战士刘德桂说得好：“这就看得出祖国的力量是多么雄厚！”
    一班的炕上整齐地排放着厚实的棉装，这是新近发下的，战士们特别满意与喜爱它。谈到这些，战士们都非常兴奋。今年棉衣的布比去年细致，质量好，棉花也特别厚实。战士赵庆书说：“这就是祖国建设的成绩。听指导员说去年东北有十五万农民进了工厂，这样看来，祖国的工业是大大发展了。”三班长贺成俊说：“工业发展了，祖国才能强盛。”
    战士们一面称赞棉衣的质料和式样，一面感谢毛主席和祖国人民对他们的关怀和爱护。战士高清升说：“今年的棉衣缝得密，屁股上还扎一层布，这是根据我们的需要，为我们着想而做的。”这时，好几个战士抢着说：“毛主席和国内人民真是想得太周到了！每套棉衣还附一个针线包，里面有一块布，两根针，一束黄线。”“还有天津出品的杀虫粉。”“还有急救包、三角带，真合前线的需要。”“还有慰问信……”说着，嚷着……班长姚盛忠立刻从口袋里掏出一封上海某工厂工人陈阿根的慰问信，信上说：“志愿军同志们为保卫祖国，保卫世界和平站在斗争的最前线，打击美国侵略者，我们工人兄弟全力支援你们，你们需要什么，请告诉我们，我们好给你们解决。希望你们英勇杀敌，把美国鬼子早日赶出朝鲜去！”
    正谈着话，美国飞机从天空隆隆地飞过。青年团员张九皋轻蔑地看了一眼说：“敌人在开城谈判中吹嘘什么‘空中优势’，有什么了不起？不管它多么疯狂，我们有祖国人民雄厚力量的支援，一定能战胜它！”
