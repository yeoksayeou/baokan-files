Response to Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

To the Editors:

We have read the "Brief Commentary on Party Life" in the People's Daily on October 5th, which criticized the leading cadres of the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Mill. Prior to the criticism in the People's Daily, the Tianjin Daily had already made similar criticisms of the mill's leading cadres. We also spoke with the mill's leading cadres. Although they admitted their mistakes, they did not resolve the issue ideologically. This kind of thinking also exists among cadres in other factories, only to varying degrees. Therefore, we have decided to organize an inspection team to conduct an in-depth investigation and study at the No. 2 Cotton Mill; and through this fact, educate cadres in other factories.

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

    华北纺织管理局党委会着手检查天津棉纺二厂领导工作编辑同志：
    十月五日人民日报“党的生活简评”对国营天津棉纺二厂领导干部的批评已看到了。在人民日报批评以前，天津日报已对该厂领导干部提出同样批评，我们并与该厂领导干部谈过话；虽然他们也承认有错误，但并未从思想上解决问题。这种思想在其它厂的干部同样存在，只有程度上的不同而已。因此，我们决定组织一个检查组，到棉纺二厂作一深入的调查研究；并通过这一事实，教育其它厂的干部。
