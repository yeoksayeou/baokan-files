The Feixi County People's Court in Anhui Province has delivered a verdict in the case of Meng Zhangshi, from Hengcheng Village, Xinjie Township, Feixi County, who was forced to commit suicide. The perpetrator, Meng Qinghe, was sentenced to 15 years in prison.

Meng Zhangshi was born in 1930 into a desperately poor family. At three months old, she was adopted into the Meng family as a child bride. The Meng family were classified as poor peasants, and the six family members struggled to make ends meet. At the age of seventeen, Meng Zhangshi was married to Meng Qinghe at the behest of her mother-in-law. Before the marriage, the deceased was frequently beaten and scolded by her fiancé and his older brother and sister-in-law. On one occasion, she was beaten by her brother-in-law, Meng Qingsheng, over a matter of chopping grass, leaving her nose bleeding. Her mother-in-law showed her some pity, and the deceased respected her mother-in-law in return. After the marriage, the couple's relationship was strained, and they frequently argued and fought. The mother-in-law often tried to mediate, but to no avail. After the land reform, Meng Zhangshi's active participation in social activities further fueled the dissatisfaction of her husband and his older brother and sister-in-law. On the 20th day of the twelfth lunar month last year, Meng Zhangshi was scolded by Meng Qingsheng for participating in the Yangge dance, who accused her of being "improper and wanting to run off with someone." On the night of March 27th this year, Meng Qinghe beat Meng Zhangshi, first with fists and feet, and then with a ash rake, injuring Meng Zhangshi's lower abdomen, lower back, little finger and ring finger on her right hand. The next morning, Meng Zhangshi sat on the bed crying. Meng Qinghe, taking her by surprise, poured half a pot of boiling water down the back of Meng Zhangshi's neck, scalding her chest, back, and shoulders. Meng Zhangshi cried out, "Mommy, I'm burning to death!" Meng Qinghe ignored her and picked up a carrying pole to carry corn from the Qianren Bridge. After breakfast that day, Meng Zhangshi, taking advantage of the absence of her mother-in-law, older brother and sister-in-law, hanged herself.

After Meng Zhangshi hanged herself, the village cadres not only did not seek justice for the deceased but also spread rumors that "she was killed by ghosts." The report made by the deceased's family and the village cadres to the township government was falsified, stating: "The deceased and her husband had always had a good relationship, and they were both very honest. This time, without any argument or quarrel, she hanged herself at home because she was bewitched by a ghost. If it weren't for a ghost, how could a person hang themselves from a bamboo pole under an eave less than six feet high?..." The township reported to the district people's government in the same vein, and the district people's government reported to the county people's court in the same way. The county people's court happened to have a circuit trial team consisting of Wang Quanzhou and Yuan Shiying who had arrived in the township, and the county people's court then notified Wang and Yuan to investigate the case. Wang and Yuan, together with the district government and the district democratic women's federation, appeared under the guise of a leadership dike repair work team to conduct investigations among the masses. The village cadres tried their best to conceal the details of the case, only saying: "She was killed by ghosts. That day, three ghosts crossed the river on a ferry. One went to the Meng's house, and because Meng Zhangshi was beautiful, he took her away. The other two ghosts went over there." When asked if there were really ghosts, they replied: "Today we don't talk about superstition. There are no big ghosts, but there are small ghosts." The township head also said the same thing.

These responses from the township and village cadres naturally did not convince the Feixi County People's Court. The county people's court had the following grounds for suspecting the case:

(1) The village cadres, some of the masses, and the deceased's family all said that Meng Zhangshi was killed by "ghosts," which was obviously a deceptive statement.

(2) Some of the masses were very suspicious of Meng Zhangshi's death.

(3) At the place where the deceased hanged herself, rope marks were found on a beam.

(4) When talking to Meng Qinghe, he initially said that "the couple had a good relationship in the past and did not fight," but when questioned further, his face turned white, his body trembled, and he was speechless.

In order to clarify the facts of the case, it was necessary to exhume the body for an autopsy. However, at the beginning, all parties disagreed with exhuming the body for an autopsy. The deceased's family said: "Let it be. When a girl dies, you can't turn the body over. The two families still have to reconcile in the future." The husband's family said: "As long as her family is willing to let the male comrades examine the body, we fully agree, which can also clear our grievances." The village cadres said: "The higher-ups want to examine the body, which means they don't believe us." In response to the above situation, the cadres of the county people's court educated them, explaining that the government has the responsibility to protect the lives of the people and that the matter should be clarified. After more than a day of persuasion and mobilization, their consent was obtained, and the coffin was exhumed on the afternoon of April 2nd. At this time, the scalded areas of the body had begun to rot, and the stench filled the air. The wounds on the body were also verified one by one. Afterwards, the autopsy personnel unanimously agreed that Meng Zhangshi's death was due to continuous abuse, and that she was forced to hang herself after being scalded this time. Chen Sitian, who initially untied the rope and released the body, also testified that Meng Zhangshi was indeed hanged on the beam. Faced with all kinds of conclusive evidence, Meng Qinghe could not quibble and confessed to the previous discord between the couple and the circumstances of this abuse. At this point, the truth of the case was revealed.

After the case was clarified, the county people's court invited personnel from the county democratic women's federation to jointly study the handling of the case. Some cadres believed that Meng Qinghe's methods were vicious, and that three cases of women being forced to death had occurred in Chengnan District in succession. If he was not severely punished, there would be no guarantee for the lives of women. It was recommended that Meng Qinghe be sentenced to death. Some people believed that he should not be sentenced to death. After deliberation by the trial committee, it was believed that although Meng Qinghe had caused the bad consequence of forcing someone to death, it was not an intentional homicide; and the root cause of the case was caused by the feudal marriage system. In order to punish and educate Meng Qinghe himself and educate the masses, Meng Qinghe was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. Afterwards, the masses have no objection to this.

### 肥西县孟张氏被逼自杀案判决  凶犯孟庆和判处有期徒刑十五年

    肥西县孟张氏被逼自杀案判决
    凶犯孟庆和判处有期徒刑十五年
    皖北肥西县新街乡横城村孟张氏被逼自杀案，肥西县人民法院依法判决，凶犯孟庆和被判处有期徒刑十五年。
    孟张氏，一九三○年生，家赤贫，生后三个月被孟家抱去当童养媳。孟家贫农成份，全家六口人，生活较为困难。死者于十七岁时，由婆母作主，与孟庆和结婚。婚前，死者经常遭受未婚夫及其兄嫂的打骂，如一次为铡草事，被夫兄孟庆盛打得鼻孔流血。婆母对死者还怜悯，死者对婆母也尊重。婚后，夫妻感情不合，经常争吵打架，婆母常从中劝解，并无效果。土地改革后，孟张氏因为积极参加社会活动，更引起丈夫和兄嫂的不满。去年旧历十二月二十日，孟张氏因参加扭秧歌，被孟庆盛骂为“不正派，要跟人跑”。今年三月二十七日半夜，孟庆和殴打孟张氏，先则拳打脚踢，继以灰耙毒打，孟张氏的小腹、后腰、右手小指和无名指均被击伤。次日清晨，孟张氏坐在床边哭泣，孟庆和乘其不备，将半罐开水，从孟张氏的后颈倒下去，将孟张氏前胸、后背、两肩烫伤。孟张氏哭喊：“妈呀，烫死我了！”孟庆和不予理睬，拿起扁担到千人桥去担玉蜀黍。孟张氏于当日早饭后，乘婆母兄嫂外出，悬梁自尽而死。
    孟张氏吊死后，村干部不但不为死者申冤，反造谣说“是鬼搞死的”。死者家属及村干部向乡政府的报告是假造的，说：“死者同丈夫感情一向很好，两人很老实。这次无争无吵，独自在家被鬼催上吊死的。假若不是有鬼，那能在不到六尺高的屋檐下一根竹竿上吊死人呢？……”该乡以同样的意思报告了区人民政府，区人民政府也照样报告县人民法院。县人民法院适有巡审小组汪泉舟、袁世英两人到达该乡，县人民法院遂通知汪、袁二人对此案进行调查。汪、袁二人便会同区政府与区民主妇女联合会，以领导修堤的工作队的名义出现，在群众中进行调查。该村干部对此案详情极力隐瞒，只说：“是鬼搞死的。那天有三个鬼乘渡船过河，一个到孟家，因孟张氏漂亮，将她带走了。还有两个鬼到那边去了。”追问是否真的有鬼？回答说：“今天不讲迷信，没有大鬼，小鬼也是有的。”该乡乡长也是同样说法。
    这些乡、村干部的答复，当然不能使肥西县人民法院相信。县人民法院对此案怀疑的根据有以下几点：
    （一）村干部、部分群众和死者家属都说“鬼”把孟张氏搞死的，显然是一种欺瞒的说法。
    （二）有的群众对孟张氏的死非常怀疑。
    （三）在死者吊死的地方，发现在一根梁上有绳迹。
    （四）与孟庆和谈话时，初问则说“过去夫妻感情很好，不打架”，继问则脸色变白，身体发抖，无言可答。
    为了弄清案情，只有开棺验尸。但对开棺验尸，开始时，各方都不同意。死者娘家的人说：“死了就算了。女孩子死了，不能翻尸倒骨，以后两家还要和好。”婆家的人说：“只要她娘家肯让男同志验尸，我们十分同意，这也可以洗清我们的冤。”村干部说：“上面要验尸，是不相信我们。”针对上述情况，县人民法院干部对他们进行了教育，说明政府有保障人民生命的职责，应该把事情弄清楚。经过一天多的说服动员，取得了他们的同意，于四月二日下午开棺验尸。此时，尸体被烫处已开始腐烂，臭气四溢。尸体上的伤痕也一一验出。事后，验尸的人员一致认为孟张氏之死，是因一贯遭受虐待，此次被烫后不得已而悬梁自尽的。当初解绳放尸的陈四田也证明孟张氏确是在梁上吊死的。孟庆和在种种确实证据面前，无法狡辩，供认以往夫妻感情不和及此次虐害的情形。到此案情大白。
    案情弄清后，县人民法院即邀请县民主妇女联合会派人共同研究处理。部分干部认为孟庆和手段毒辣，而城南区已连续发生逼死妇女案三起，若不严加惩处，则对妇女生命毫无保障，建议判孟庆和以死刑；有人认为不应判死刑。后经审判委员会研究，认为孟庆和虽造成逼死人命的恶果，但并非蓄意杀害；而本案发生的根源，乃是由于封建婚姻制度所造成。为了惩罚与教育孟庆和本人并教育群众，判处孟庆和有期徒刑十五年。事后，群众对此尚无意见。
