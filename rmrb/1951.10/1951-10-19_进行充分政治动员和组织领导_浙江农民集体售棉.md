    Conduct Thorough Political Mobilization and Organizational Leadership
    Zhejiang Farmers Collectively Sell Cotton
    Thanks to the extensive organization of farmers by cooperative societies in cotton-producing areas of Zhejiang Province to launch a patriotic collective cotton selling campaign, the purchase volume in the first month of the new cotton purchasing work exceeded the original plan by more than two times. In order to launch the patriotic collective cotton selling movement, cooperative societies in various parts of Zhejiang Province first carried out vigorous political education in the countryside at the beginning of the new cotton purchasing work. Under the leadership of responsible cadres of local people's governments and CCP committees, county, township, and village cotton farmer representative meetings and cooperative member representative meetings were held in cotton producing areas. Most of the representatives who participated in the meetings became active propagandists and organizers in promoting the collective cotton selling movement after they returned. In the propaganda and mobilization, they all used their own experiences of recollection and comparison to inspire everyone to love the motherland, support the People's Government, and strengthen their political awareness of resisting America and aiding Korea in village meetings, farmers' association groups, or administrative groups, and then promoted the rationale of quick picking and quick selling to support the rapid increase in cotton textile industry production and consolidate stable prices. After the propaganda and mobilization, the groups generally revised the patriotic covenants, listing "guaranteeing to sell all cotton produced to the state" into the covenant, and specifically discussed the patriotic collective cotton selling methods. Groups and villages spontaneously competed with each other. In Guali Township, Xiaoshan County, more than thirty young people volunteered to join the army to aid Korea. The farmers were concerned that they would need cotton clothing in the cold weather, so the slogan "Sell cotton quickly to support the front and support the volunteers" immediately became the common aspiration of the cotton farmers in the township.
    Sufficient political mobilization enabled the smooth development of the organizational work of the collective cotton selling movement. In order to ensure quick harvesting and selling, cotton farmers in various cotton producing areas generally established organizations to lead the collective cotton selling. In some villages in Xiaoshan, Haining, and other counties, under the collective cotton selling organization, communication, inspection, statistics, mutual aid, and security groups were set up, responsible for telling everyone the time of collective sales before selling cotton, checking the quality of cotton from house to house, understanding the amount of picking, the amount of sales, and counting the weight of cotton sold each time by household. When selling cotton, they also helped the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers who lacked labor to carry cotton, mobilized the militia to carry out security work, and prevented illegal vendors from rushing to buy. During collective cotton sales, the cotton was first initially classified, graded, and counted by groups, and then collectively sold to the cooperative society. The selling time and order of each village were specifically agreed upon based on the cotton production of each village, the actual and expected picking volume, and the purchasing capacity of the flower collection station. In this way, the cooperative society can actively grasp the situation, organize forces in advance, prepare funds, and dispatch materials, transportation, and processing equipment to improve the efficiency of the purchase work.
    In order to facilitate the collective cotton selling of cotton farmers, the cooperative's flower collection station established a transaction system and procedures adapted to the collective cotton selling. When the cotton selling groups in Haining, Hangxian and other places sell cotton, they first submit a list of cotton selling households, arrange the cotton according to the original preliminary classification and category, and the flower inspectors inspect the goods, then weigh them one by one, settle the accounts by household, pay uniformly, and distribute them to each selling household by the group leader. In this way, the cotton farmers who sell cotton can go home after the cotton has been inspected and weighed, and the average time for each village to sell cotton is only two hours. The cooperative's flower collection station in Kanshan District, Xiaoshan County, spends an average of only three or four minutes per transaction, from inspection and weighing to the selling households receiving payment, which cotton farmers are generally satisfied with.

    进行充分政治动员和组织领导
    浙江农民集体售棉
    浙江省各产棉区合作社由于广泛组织农民展开爱国主义集体售棉运动，收购新棉工作的第一个月，收购量便超过了原订计划的二倍多。为了展开爱国主义集体售棉运动，浙江省各地合作社于收购新棉工作开始时，首先在农村中大力进行政治教育。在各地人民政府和中共党委的负责干部领导下，各产棉区的县、乡、村都举行了棉农代表会议和合作社社员代表会议。参加会议的代表们回去后，大都成为推动集体售棉运动的积极宣传者和组织者。在宣传动员中，他们都用回忆、对比自己亲身经历的办法，在村民大会、农会小组或行政小组里启发大家热爱祖国、拥护人民政府、加强抗美援朝的政治觉悟，进而宣传快摘快卖支持国家棉纺工业迅速加班生产和巩固物价平稳的道理。在宣传动员之后，各小组普遍修订了爱国公约，将“保证把所产棉花全部卖给国家”列入公约，并具体地讨论了爱国集体售棉办法。组与组、村与村自发地进行比赛。萧山县瓜沥乡有三十多个青年志愿参军援朝，农民们惦记他们天冷需要棉衣，因而“快卖棉花，支援前线，支援志愿军”的口号，立即成了该乡棉农共同的心愿。
    充分的政治动员使集体售棉运动的组织工作顺利开展。各产棉区棉农为保证快收快卖，都普遍建立了领导集体售棉的组织。萧山、海宁等县的部分乡村在集体售棉组织下，分设通讯、检查、统计、互助、保卫等小组，负责在售棉前告诉大家集体出售的时间，挨户检查棉花的品质，了解采摘量、出售量，分户统计每次出售棉花的斤量。售棉时，他们又帮助革命烈士家属、革命军人家属等缺少劳力的农户担送棉花，动员民兵进行保卫工作，并防止违法商贩抢购。集体售棉时，以小组为单位，先将棉花初步分类、评级统计，然后集体送到合作社出售。各村出售时间和次序，根据各村产棉量、实际与预计采摘量以及收花站收购能力，具体商定。这样合作社便能主动掌握情况，事先组织力量，准备资金，调度物资、运输及加工设备等，以提高收购工作效率。
    合作社收花站为便利棉农集体售棉，建立了与集体售棉相适应的交易制度和手续。海宁、杭县等地售棉小组售棉时先交上出售户的售棉清单，将棉花按原来初步分好的等级、类别摆开，由验花人员验货，然后挨户过磅，分户结算，统一付款，由小组长分给各出售户。这样，售棉的棉农在棉花检验过磅后即可回家，每村售棉时间平均不过两小时。萧山县龛山区合作社收花站平均每笔交易，从检验、过磅到售户取款，只花三、四分钟，棉农普遍感到满意。（新华社）
