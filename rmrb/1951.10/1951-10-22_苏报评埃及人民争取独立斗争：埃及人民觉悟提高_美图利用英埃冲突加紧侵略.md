(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 21st) TASS, Moscow, 20th: The "Izvestia" published an article by Akopyan, commenting on the Egyptian situation, saying: The relationship between Britain, which has controlled the Nile River basin for seventy years, and Egypt, has entered a new stage.

The Egyptian people have long intended to abolish the Anglo-Egyptian treaty imposed on them that restricts Egyptian sovereignty and gives Britain the right to station troops on Egyptian territory. When controlling the Nile River basin, British imperialists repeatedly promised to respect the national interests of the Egyptian people, withdraw troops stationed in Egypt, and allow the Egyptian people to enjoy full independence. However, all these promises were nothing more than deceptive tricks.

Akopyan also said: British propaganda says that British troops are stationed in the Suez Canal area for the "defense" of the Suez Canal, but this kind of nonsense cannot deceive anyone.

Under the pressure of the broad masses of the people across the country, the Egyptian government rejected the principle of "joint defense" and refused to participate in the North Atlantic Treaty system—if Egypt participates in the North Atlantic Treaty system, foreign troops will be stationed in Egypt. The Egyptian government finally believed that it was impossible to withdraw British troops from the Nile River basin through negotiation, and decided to declare the abolition of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 that bound Egypt. The British ruling clique resorted to intimidation. Moreover, according to the Egyptian government, on October 17, British troops forcibly occupied Egyptian cities in the Suez Canal area such as Port Said, Ismailia, and Qantara. The British occupied Suez Canal crossing tools, bridges, and crossings between the Suez Canal area and the Sinai Peninsula. British imperialists are increasing their garrison forces in the Suez Canal area, transferring the 16th Parachute Brigade from Cyprus to the Suez Canal area, and dispatching several warships there. The British military headquarters, on the pretext that the Egyptian police are unable to maintain order in the area, decided to "personally assume" the responsibility of maintaining order in the Suez Canal. All these actions have made the crisis between Egypt and Britain more serious.

Akopyan said: Britain intends to rely on the support of the United States when resolving Anglo-Egyptian disputes. Although the United States and Britain have conflicting interests in the Near East and have contradictions with each other, they collude again when it comes to maintaining the colonial system. At the same time, the US ruling clique also intends to use the opportunity to "mediate" the Anglo-Egyptian conflict to consolidate its position in the Nile River basin.

Now, under the guise of "joint defense of the Suez Canal and the entire Middle East," the United States is trying to establish military control over the Suez Canal area. Agence France-Presse reported that the goal the United States is striving for is:

"To prevent the military occupation of the Suez Canal area from being solely by British troops." The United States hopes to obtain military bases in Egypt.

Akopyan concluded: The situation in Egypt shows how much the Egyptian people's national consciousness has increased compared to 1936. Today, it is no longer so easy to force Egypt to accept restrictive and unequal treaties or to deceive the Egyptian people. The Egyptian people have risen up to fight for peace and national independence.

### 苏报评埃及人民争取独立斗争：埃及人民觉悟提高  美图利用英埃冲突加紧侵略

    苏报评埃及人民争取独立斗争：
    埃及人民觉悟提高
    美图利用英埃冲突加紧侵略
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：“消息报”刊载阿科彼扬所写的一篇文章，评论埃及情势说：七十年来控制着尼罗河流域的英国和埃及的关系，已经进入了一个新的阶段。
    埃及人民很久以来就打算废除强加在他们身上束缚他们的英埃条约，这个条约限制埃及的主权，使英国有在埃及领土上驻军的权利。英帝国主义者在控制尼罗河流域的时候，屡次许下尊重埃及人民的民族利益、撤退驻在埃及的军队和使埃及人民享受充分独立的诺言。可是，所有这些诺言，归根结底都不过是一些欺人的手段。
    阿科彼扬又说：英国的宣传说，英军驻扎苏彝士运河地带，是为了苏彝士运河的“防务”，这种谰言是骗不过任何人的。
    在全国广大人民的压力下，埃及政府拒绝了“共同防御”的原则，也拒绝参加北大西洋公约体系——如果埃及参加北大西洋公约体系，外国军队就要驻扎在埃及。埃及政府最后认为不可能以谈判的方式使英军自尼罗河流域撤退，决定宣布废除束缚埃及的一九三六年所订的英埃条约。英国统治集团采取了恫吓手段。这还不算，又据埃及政府的消息，英军在十月十七日以武力侵占了苏彝士运河地带塞得港、伊士美利亚、关答拉等埃及城市。英国人占据了苏彝士运河航渡工具、桥梁以及苏彝士运河地带和西奈半岛之间的渡口。英帝国主义者正在增加他们在苏彝士运河地带的守备兵力，把第十六伞兵旅从塞浦路斯岛调到苏彝士运河地带，并且又调遣了几艘军舰到那里去。英军司令部以埃及警察没有力量维持这一地区的秩序为藉口，决定“亲自担当”在苏彝士运河维持秩序的责任。这一切行动使得埃及和英国两国之间的危机更加严重。
    阿科彼扬说：英国在解决英埃纠纷的时候，打算依靠美国的支持。尽管美英两国在近东有着利害冲突，彼此之间有着矛盾，可是临到维持殖民制度的问题的时候，它们就又勾搭起来了。同时，美国统治集团也有意利用“调解”英埃冲突的机会，巩固自己在尼罗河流域的地位。
    现在美国在“共同防御苏彝士运河及中东全部地区”的伪装下，正努力建立对苏彝士运河地带的军事控制权。法新社的消息说，美国争取的目标是：
    “不使苏彝士运河地带的军事占领，带有单由英军占领的性质。”美国希望在埃及获得军事基地。
    阿科彼扬最后说：埃及的情势表明了埃及人民的民族自觉性比一九三六年的时候提高了多少。今天再来强使埃及接受束缚性的不平等条约，再来欺骗埃及人民，已经不是那样容易了，埃及人民已经起来争取和平和民族独立。
