A Short Review of Economic Life

    The "Several Measures Regarding the Handling of Dangerous Goods," formulated by the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government, has been promulgated. This is another important measure in protecting labor following the "Provisional Measures for Abolishing the Feudal Headman System in the Handling Industry in Various Places" promulgated by the Government Administration Council in March last year.

    Since the Government Administration Council promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Abolishing the Feudal Headman System in the Handling Industry in Various Places," a vigorous anti-feudal headman movement has been launched in various places, gradually improving the working and living conditions of the handling workers. However, the handling of dangerous goods has not been reasonably resolved; therefore, explosions and poisoning accidents continue to occur in the handling industry, which not only endangers the lives and health of the handling workers but also causes losses to state property. The promulgation and implementation of the "Several Measures Regarding the Handling of Dangerous Goods" will further guarantee the lives and safety of the 800,000 handling workers nationwide and provide more favorable conditions for the successful completion of national production tasks.

    The measures stipulate that handling companies must have sufficient and effective protective equipment and first-aid facilities, relevant authorities must establish and improve safe operating procedures, and handling trade unions and handling companies should conduct necessary safety education for workers. The measures also clearly stipulate the investigation and punishment of accident responsibility and the compensation for worker injuries, deaths, medical treatment, and pensions. These regulations require the cargo owners to pay attention to worker injury accidents and protect labor, while also allowing workers to be free from worries in their work so that they can better exert their labor enthusiasm. The measures stipulate that the working hours of workers handling toxic substances shall not exceed eight hours per day, and their wages shall be calculated at 115% to 150% of the wages for handling ordinary goods, which provides better conditions for improving the lives of handling workers.

    In order to implement the government's policy of protecting labor, all relevant departments must study these measures in detail and implement them conscientiously to ensure the safety and health of handling workers nationwide and strive to complete the national economic construction tasks.

### 保护劳动的又一重要措施

    保护劳动的又一重要措施
    中央人民政府劳动部制定的“关于搬运危险性物品的几项办法”公布了。这是继去年三月政务院颁布“废除各地搬运事业中封建把持制度暂行处理办法”之后，在保护劳动方面的又一重要措施。
    自政务院颁布“废除各地搬运事业中封建把持制度暂行处理办法”以来，各地先后掀起了轰轰烈烈的反封建把头运动，逐步改善了搬运工人的劳动条件和生活条件。但是，关于危险性物品的搬运问题，还没得到合理的解决；因此，搬运业中还不断发生爆炸及中毒事故，这不但使搬运工人的生命安全与身体健康受到危害，而且使国家财产遭受损失。“关于搬运危险性物品的几项办法”的公布及其实行，将使全国八十万搬运工人的生活与生命安全得到进一步的保障，并为顺利完成国家生产任务提供更有利的条件。
    这个办法中规定：搬运公司必须备有足够的有效的防护用具及急救设备，有关机关必须建立与健全安全操作的规程制度，搬运工会与搬运公司应向工人进行必要的安全教育。关于事故责任之追究处分以及对工人之伤亡、医疗、抚恤，该办法中也有明确规定。这些规定使货主方面必须重视工人伤亡事故，注意保护劳动，同时使工人在工作中，可以解除顾虑，以便更好地发挥劳动热情。办法中规定搬运有毒物品的工人每天工作时间不得超过八小时，其工资应按搬运普通物品的工资的百分之一百一十五至百分之一百五十计算，这就为搬运工人的生活改善提供了更好的条件。
    为贯彻政府保护劳动的政策，各有关部门对这一办法必须详细研究，并认真执行，以确保全国搬运工人的安全与健康，为完成国家经济建设任务而奋斗。
