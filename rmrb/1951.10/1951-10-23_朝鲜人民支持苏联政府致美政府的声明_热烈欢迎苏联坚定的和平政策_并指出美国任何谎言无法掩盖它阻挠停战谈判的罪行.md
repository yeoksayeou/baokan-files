Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd - Korean newspapers and people from all walks of life unanimously support the Soviet government's statement to the U.S. government regarding the Korean situation and Soviet-U.S. relations. "Labor News," in its commentary on the Soviet government's statement, pointed out: Although the U.S. government is trying its best to shift the responsibility for its own aggressive policy to others, reality will ultimately completely shatter the aggressor's attempt. Coke, in his statement, said: The U.S. government hopes that the Soviet government will help to bring the Kaesong negotiations to a successful conclusion. But everyone knows that although the United States had no choice but to agree to armistice negotiations, it has tried every possible way to obstruct the progress of the armistice negotiations. The "Democratic Korea" newspaper's editorial stated: In order for the armistice negotiations to succeed, the U.S. government must instruct Ridgway not to complicate the negotiations with various provocative acts, and not to create artificial obstacles. People will not be deceived by empty talk of peace, and justice and truth will surely defeat lies.

    Park Jeong-ae, Chairman of the Korean Democratic Women's League, who won the Stalin International Peace Prize, said: The Soviet government's statement once again exposed the hypocrisy of the U.S. imperialists' empty talk of peace; at the same time, it once again showed the people of the world the Soviet Union's peaceful policy and its open and aboveboard attitude. The shameless U.S. aggressors are delaying and obstructing the resumption of the Korean armistice negotiations with their usual tricks, but instead want to shift this responsibility to the Korean and Chinese People's Armies. This clumsy method cannot deceive anyone. The entire Korean people warmly support the Soviet government's statement. If the U.S. government has the slightest sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue, it should show it with practical actions.

    Kim Chang-jun, Director of the Central Secretariat of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front, in his speech, strongly condemned the U.S. aggressors who are frantically preparing for a new war for their shameless methods of rejecting various reasonable proposals repeatedly put forward by the Soviet Union to maintain world peace, while at the same time shifting the responsibility for creating international tension to the Soviet Union. He said: The Korean people, together with all the good people of the world, are watching the actions taken by the United States regarding the Korean armistice negotiations. No lies or clamoring by the U.S. aggressors can cover up their criminal acts of deliberately obstructing the smooth progress of the armistice negotiations.

    Jeong Seong-yeon, Vice Chairman of the Korean Democratic Party, said: The Korean people clearly know that it is the U.S. imperialists who are invading their homeland and slaughtering their parents and siblings, and it is also the U.S. imperialists who are trying their best to sabotage the armistice negotiations; the Korean people also know more clearly that it is the Soviet Union that has consistently advocated a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, and it is also the Soviet Union that firmly stands at the forefront of defending world peace. Therefore, we warmly welcome and support the Soviet government's statement that once again clarifies its policy of peace. If the U.S. government still does not abandon its conspiracy to expand the war, it will only meet with complete failure.

    朝鲜人民支持苏联政府致美政府的声明
    热烈欢迎苏联坚定的和平政策
    并指出美国任何谎言无法掩盖它阻挠停战谈判的罪行
    【新华社平壤二十二日电】朝鲜各报与各阶层人民一致支持苏联政府关于朝鲜局势与苏美关系致美国政府的声明。 “劳动新闻”在评论苏联政府声明时指出：美国政府虽然竭力想把它对自己的侵略政策所应负的责任推卸给别人，但是现实终将使侵略者的企图完全破产。寇克在他的声明中说：美国政府希望苏联政府帮助使开城谈判完满结束。但是大家知道：美国虽然不得已而同意进行停战谈判，但它又千方百计地阻挠停战谈判的进行。 “民主朝鲜”报的社论说：为了要使停战谈判获得成功，美国政府必须指示李奇微不要以种种挑衅行为使谈判复杂化，不要制造人为的障碍。人们是不会受空谈和平的谎话的欺骗的，正义和真理一定能击败谎言。
    荣获斯大林国际和平奖金的朝鲜民主妇女同盟委员长朴正爱说：苏联政府的声明又一次揭穿了美帝国主义者空谈和平的伪善面目；同时又一次地向全世界人民表明了苏联的和平政策与光明正大的态度。厚颜无耻的美国侵略者以其一贯伎俩拖延与阻挠朝鲜停战谈判的恢复，反而想把这一责任推卸到朝、中人民军队身上，它这种拙劣的手法是欺骗不了任何人的。全朝鲜人民热烈支持苏联政府的声明。如果美国政府对和平解决朝鲜问题有丝毫诚意的话，它就应该以实际行动来表示。
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央书记局长金昌俊发表谈话，痛斥疯狂准备新战争的美国侵略者一方面拒绝苏联为维护世界和平屡次提出的各项合理方案、一方面把造成国际间紧张空气的责任推到苏联身上的无耻手法。他说：朝鲜人民和全世界善良的人民一起，注视着美国对朝鲜停战谈判所采取的行动。美国侵略者的任何谎言叫嚣是无法掩盖它故意阻挠停战谈判顺利进行的罪恶行为的。
    朝鲜民主党副委员长郑圣彦说：朝鲜人民清楚地知道：侵略自己祖国屠杀自己父母兄弟的是美帝国主义者，千方百计地破坏停战谈判的也是美帝国主义者；朝鲜人民更清楚地知道：一贯主张和平解决朝鲜问题的是苏联，坚决站在保卫世界和平最前列的，也是苏联。因此，我们热烈欢迎与支持苏联政府再一次阐明它的和平政策的声明。美国政府如果仍不放弃它的扩大战争的阴谋，它就只有遭到彻底的失败。
