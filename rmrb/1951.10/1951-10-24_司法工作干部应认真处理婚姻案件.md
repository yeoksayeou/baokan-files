To the Editor:

I strongly agree with the suggestion made by comrades Xiao Zihua and Wang Jing in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on the 11th of this month regarding "Cadres responsible for cases of abuse and murder of women should be punished and make public self-criticisms." I believe that those relevant cadres who disregard women's lives and are perfunctory and irresponsible must receive the punishment they deserve. Recently, the People's Daily has successively exposed many cases of bloody tragedies caused by marriage problems, which are indeed shocking. For example, the "Resolutely Implement the Marriage Law, Protect Women's Rights" column on the third page on the 11th listed more than 20 similar cases. I read them several times without missing a word. In this group of cases, more than ten women have been brutally murdered or forced to commit suicide because of marriage problems. This alarming summary figure deserves our attention and vigilance. If such intolerable attitudes as procrastination, perfunctoriness, apathy, and shirking responsibility constantly exist in judicial work, women's liberation will be hindered to a certain extent. Therefore, I specifically suggest that higher judicial organs investigate the responsibility of derelict cadres and deal with them seriously. I also suggest:

One, judicial organs should convey this message level by level, and every judicial officer should correctly implement the Marriage Law, promptly resolve and handle marriage issues, and take the Marriage Law as an important part of their study.

Two, other relevant organs and cadres should promptly assist in resolving and handling marriage issues.

Three, women's federations at all levels in districts, villages, streets, and towns should widely organize all women (especially elderly women, because they are mothers and mothers-in-law) to publicize the Marriage Law to them, educate them not to interfere in their children's freedom of marriage and not to abuse women, and educate general women that when they encounter marriage problems, they should rely on the strength of the organization and resolutely fight the feudal marriage system to the end.

### 司法工作干部应认真处理婚姻案件

专栏：

    司法工作干部应认真处理婚姻案件编辑同志：
    我非常同意本月十一日人民日报“读者来信”栏中所载萧子华、王静二同志关于“对虐杀妇女案件应负责的干部应当受到惩处并作公开检讨”一文的建议。我认为，那些漠视妇女生命、敷衍塞责的有关干部，必须受到应得的惩处。最近人民日报曾先后揭露了不少因婚姻问题招致流血惨案的事情，确是令人触目惊心。如十一日三版“坚决贯彻婚姻法，保障妇女权利”一栏，又列举了二十来件类似案情，我一字不遗地看了几遍。在这一束案件中，已有十多名妇女为了婚姻问题，被人惨杀或被逼自杀。这一惊人的总结数字，值得我们重视与警惕。若在司法工作中经常存在着这种拖延、敷衍、麻痹、推诿等各种不能容忍的作风，妇女的解放就要受到一定的阻力。为此，特建议高级司法机关对失职干部追究责任，予以严肃处理。并建议：
    一、司法机关要逐级向下传达，每一司法人员要正确执行婚姻法，及时解决处理婚姻问题，并以婚姻法作为重要学习内容。
    二、其他有关机关与干部要及时协助解决与处理婚姻问题。
    三、区、村、街、镇各级妇联要广泛地组织起所有妇女来（尤其老年妇女，因为她们是当母亲与婆母的），向她们宣传婚姻法，教育她们不要干涉儿女婚姻自由和虐待妇女，教育一般妇女，遇到婚姻问题时，要依靠组织力量，坚决向封建婚姻制度斗争到底。  读者  杨万甲
