Some Opinions from Two Years of Experience
—A Dedication for the Second Anniversary of National Day
Ma Xulun

As we enthusiastically and joyfully celebrate the second anniversary of the founding of our motherland, the People's Republic of China, our first shared sentiment is: "Without the Communist Party, there would be no China." Every time we celebrate this infinitely glorious festival, we sincerely thank the Chinese Communist Party and its leader, who is also our national leader, Chairman Mao Zedong. Today, in Tiananmen Square in the capital, we hear the earth-shattering shouts of "Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live Chairman Mao!" We also see the people, men and women, young and old, eagerly crowding around, reluctant to leave, expressing their sincere support and love for their leader, Chairman Mao, on the reviewing stand at the celebration rally. I believe this sound resonates in every corner of the country; this scene is replicated before the portrait of Chairman Mao at celebrations in every corner of the country. Undoubtedly, today is a day of the highest concentration of patriotic sentiment among our people. Today, in addition to expressing my sincere celebration along with the people of the whole country, I would like to write down some of the opinions I have experienced in the past two years as my congratulatory message for this year's National Day:

First, I want to say what true democracy is and what a true democratic country is like. This question is posed because there are many democratic countries in the world that are selling dog meat under the guise of sheep's heads—the free and democratic countries of capitalism. Our country also once hung the sign of the "Republic of China." Even now, many intellectuals do not understand what people's democracy is all about. In fact, the simple answer is: every person is the master of the country, and every person has the right to manage the country. When every person truly acts as the master of the country, that is true democracy and a true democratic country. However, the question is, how does each person show that he or she truly acts as the master of the country? This should first be discussed from the perspective of ideology and system: Our China is a New Democratic state under the people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance, uniting all democratic classes and all nationalities within the country, that is, a political organization led by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought; its system is democratic centralism. The organizational form of the organs exercising state power is the people's congresses at all levels and the people's governments at all levels; the people's congresses at all levels elect the committees of the people's governments at all levels, and the organs of state power at all levels uniformly implement democratic centralism. The main principles are: the people's congresses are responsible to the people and report on their work; the committees of the people's governments are responsible to the people's congresses and report on their work, and the principle of the minority subordinating to the majority is implemented within the people's congresses and the committees of the people's governments; the people's governments at all levels are subordinate to their superior people's governments. The people's congresses at all levels are elected by the people through universal suffrage. Before the conditions for universal suffrage are met, the people's representative conferences of all sectors act on behalf of the people's congresses. This system shows that the state power of our country truly belongs to the people. Now, throughout the country, all areas where land reform has been completed and the people have sufficient organizations have implemented universal suffrage to elect their organs of state power; this shows that the people have indeed become the masters of the country. I can also prove it from other aspects! (1) The supervisory committees of the people's governments at all levels receive many letters from the people expressing their opinions on administration, and the various departments of the people's governments at all levels have the same situation, and even Chairman Mao constantly receives letters from the people expressing their opinions to him; and we also see the people's opinions in the daily newspapers, especially the opinions of the workers and peasants. Their opinions are not "shooting in the dark," and the government cannot ignore them, which shows that the people not only have true freedom of speech, but also proves that they recognize that they are the masters of the country, have the right to ask about politics, and have the right to suggest or correct inappropriate actions by the government. (2) In this year's three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and carrying out land reform in newly liberated areas, the people not only showed enthusiastic support, but also automatically and actively rushed to the front line, donated weapons, exposed and accused counter-revolutionaries, and even did not protect their fathers, brothers, and relatives; participated in land reform and helped peasants to turn themselves over. This situation is consistent throughout the country; this is because they recognize that the country is their own, and they cannot but care about the country's peace and danger; they cannot but care about the internal and external counter-revolutionary enemies coming to destroy their country and seize their rights as masters that they have already obtained. (3) The people of the whole country automatically participate and enthusiastically engage in the tasks they should fulfill for the country, such as repairing the Yellow River and the Huai River, building railways and highways, and other important national engineering projects; they compete to pay grain taxes without owing any, and their support for national government orders is not only unseen in the past under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, but even unprecedented in history. From these few points, we can see the obvious differences between the people being masters and being ruled; this is a clear comparison of what true democracy is and what true democracy is like.

Secondly, from the perspective of work style: with a good system, if the work style is not good during implementation, things will also be very bad. Before the Chinese Communist Party unified the country, thanks to Chairman Mao's foresight and correct leadership, it first paid attention to this issue within the Party; as far as I understand, the CCP pays great attention to the work style of its members in their work; such as the work style of being divorced from theory and practice, the work style of being divorced from the masses, the work style of disregarding policies and being self-righteous, the subjective work style, the work style of bureaucracy, commandism, and clericalism, etc., it is almost constantly warning against them. Premier Zhou of the State Council also constantly issued warnings in administration. This is very correct and necessary.

I believe that a true democratic work style is by no means innate, but needs to be cultivated. This cultivation needs to start with ideology. Every person must first have the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly, and then they will have a true democratic work style in their work. This is what I have gained from observing others and examining myself. Now, the political study of the staff of the government, parties, groups, and schools requires everyone to abandon their individualism and stand on the position of the people, serving the people wholeheartedly in their posts. Individualism is the "leader" of all deviations, and every incorrect work style, strictly speaking, is due to the mischief of individualism; therefore, to cultivate a true democratic work style, we must first carry out ideological education. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are the content of our ideological education and the only guidance; dialectical materialism and the theory of practice are the basic textbooks for cultivating our work style; criticism and self-criticism are the best weapons for examining our work style. Staff members cultivated in this way will regard the people as something like their "strict supervisors above and beside them," and of course they will always and everywhere think for the people, so that they will create their own true democratic work style, will "seek truth from facts," will carefully consider, will correct mistakes, and will repair shortcomings; understanding that they must follow the mass line, all bad work styles will naturally retreat like "evil cannot overcome good." In my work, I have seen that Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Vice Premier Chen Yun truly have an unswerving democratic work style and are truly able to "be precise, be unified and hold to the Middle"; therefore, in the past two years, although our country has encountered dangerous storms, it has continued to advance in victory, which is not accidental.

People have a satirical saying: "The Communist Party holds many meetings," which is a fact; this is precisely a true democratic work style. Meetings are a form of work; the main advantage of this form is to concentrate opinions, save time, and solve problems. Therefore, we must face up to this kind of meeting; because it is to concentrate opinions to make decisions, if there are different opinions, they can be discussed face to face, and new and better opinions often arise from the discussion. Differences and similarities can be discussed as much as possible to draw a conclusion that is "eclectic and rich" for execution. I remember that in ancient times, Mi Zixia was the magistrate of Wucheng. Whenever something happened, he would convene a meeting with half young people and half old people; he said: "Let the young people discuss it and the old people decide it;" this was his clever work style, so the ancient books say that he "governed by playing the zither." We have only established our country for two years, but we have done many major things. If we did not hold so many meetings, how could we solve so many major problems? How could we suddenly make an old country that was bullied into a new and powerful country? However, this kind of meeting can only be held well under the leadership of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, under the current democratic system and democratic work style.

Now all the facilities of our government are based on the policies stipulated in the Common Program, with general, annual, or three-year or five-year plans, so our country, from the central government to the local governments, is like a machine in a large industry. When the machine is turned on, the gears of all sizes are moving, so there are achievements and harvests every day. This is completely different from the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and it is the overall manifestation of the politics led by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. All facilities also follow the laws of dialectics, determine the direction, clarify the tasks, and proceed in a planned and step-by-step manner without being impatient or delaying. This makes me feel that working under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we contribute as much strength as we get as much harvest. It also makes me believe that our country will advance without limit under our leadership under Chairman Mao, truly serving the people wholeheartedly.

I ask to loudly proclaim:
Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!

    两年中体验的一些意见
    ——国庆二周年的献词
    马叙伦
    我们在踊跃鼓舞皆大欢喜地庆祝我们的祖国——中华人民共和国成立第二周年纪念日，首先有一个共同的感念是：“没有共产党就没有中国”。我们每过这个无限光辉的节日，无人不衷诚地感谢中国共产党和它的领导者，也是我们国家的领导者毛泽东主席。我们当在今天的首都天安门广场听到彻天不断的中华人民共和国万岁、毛主席万岁的声浪；也当看到争先恐后拥挤不开的男男女女老老少少的人民对在庆祝大会礼台上的他们衷诚拥护的领袖毛主席恭敬亲爱流连不舍的景象。我相信这种声浪普及到全国的每一角落；这种景象也普及到全国每一角落的庆祝会上的毛主席像前。无疑地今天是我们全国人民爱国情绪最高的集中的表现的一天；我在今天，除了和全国人民一样表现我的衷诚庆祝外，我愿意写出我在这两年中体验到的一些意见，作为我对于今年国庆的祝词：
    我首先要说真正的民主是什么？真正的民主国家是怎样的？这样的提出是为了世界上有许多挂羊头卖狗肉的民主国家——资本主义的自由民主国家，我们国家也曾挂过“中华民国”的招牌；现在知识分子中还有许多不了解人民民主是怎么一回事的。其实简单不过的答复便是：每一个人民都是国家的主人，每一个人民都有管理国家的权利；每一个人民真正做到他是国家的主人，那就是真正的民主和真正的民主国家。可是，问题是在每一个人民怎样表现出他真正做了国家的主人？这首先该从主义和制度上来说：我们中国是以无产阶级为领导、工农联盟为基础的、团结各民主阶级和国内各民族的人民民主专政的新民主主义国家，也就是马列主义、毛泽东思想领导的政权组织；它的体制是民主集中制。行使政权的机关的构成形式是各级人民代表大会和各级人民政府；各级人民代表大会选举各级人民政府委员会，各级政权机关一律实行民主集中制。其主要原则为：人民代表大会向人民负责并报告工作；人民政府委员会向人民代表大会负责并报告工作，在人民代表大会和人民政府委员会内实行少数服从多数的制度；各级人民政府均服从其上级人民政府。各级人民代表大会由人民用普选方法产生之。在普选条件未具备以前由各界人民代表会议代行人民代表大会的职权。这样的制度，表现了我们国家的政权是真正属于人民的。现在，全国范围内，凡土地改革完成，人民已有充分的组织的地区都已实行普选方法产生了他们行使国家政权的机关；这就表现了人民已经确实做了国家的主人。我还可以从别的方面来证明呢！（一）各级人民政府监察委员会收到很多人民的信表示他们对于行政上的意见，各级人民政府的各部门也有同样的情形，乃至毛主席那里也不断地收到人民向他表示意见的信；还有我们在每天的报纸上见到的人民的意见书，尤其是工农大众的意见书。他们的意见书，不是“无的放矢”的，不是政府可以置之不理的，这就表现了人民不但有了真正的言论自由，而且证明了他们认识了自己是国家的主人，有权来问政治，有权来建议或纠正政府不当的行动。（二）今年抗美援朝、镇压反革命、进行新解放区的土地改革三大运动中，人民不但表现了热忱的拥护，而且自动地、积极地争上前线，捐献武器；揭发和控诉反革命，乃至不包庇他们的父兄亲戚；参加土地改革，帮助农民翻身。这种情形是举国一致的；这是他们认识了国家是他们自己的，他们不能不关心国家的平安和危险；他们不能不关心到内外反革命的敌人来破坏他们的国家和夺取他们已得的主人翁的权利。（三）全国人民对于他们对国家应尽的任务，如修治黄河和淮河、修筑铁路和公路及其他国家重要工程上的劳动工作无不自动参加，踊跃从事；缴纳粮税则争先和不欠，对国家政令的拥护等不仅是过去国民党反动派统治时期所未见，乃至为历史上所未有。从几点上可以看出人民作了主人和被统治的时候有怎样的显明的不同；这就是真正的民主是什么，怎样是真正的民主的确实对案。
    其次是从作风上来说：有了好的制度，如果执行时候作风不好，也会弄得很糟的。中国共产党在未统一全国以前，由于毛主席的高瞻熟虑、正确领导，先在党内注意了这个问题；据我所了解，中共对于它的党员在工作中的作风是很注意的；像理论与实践脱节的作风，脱离群众的作风，不顾政策、自以为是的作风，主观的作风，官僚主义、命令主义、事务主义的作风等等，几乎无日不在告诫之中。政务院周总理在行政上也时时提出告诫。这是很正确和必要的。
    我以为真正的民主作风决不是天生成的而是需要培养的。这种培养需要先在思想上着手，每一个人先有真正全心全意为人民服务的思想，才会在工作上有真正的民主作风，这是我旁观他人和检讨了自己的收获。现在政府、党派、团体、学校的工作人员的政治学习就是要求每一个人都抛弃他的个人主义而站到人民的立场来，在他们的岗位上全心全意为人民服务。个人主义是一切偏差的“戎首”，每一种不正确的作风，严格地检讨都是由于个人主义的作祟；所以，要培养成为一种真正的民主作风，必须先作思想教育。马列主义、毛泽东思想是我们思想教育的内容，也是唯一的指导；辩证唯物论和实践论是我们培养作风的基本教材；批评与自我批评是我们检查作风最好的武器。从这样培养出来的工作人员，就会把人民像是他们的“严在上临在旁”的东西，当然就会时时处处都替人民着想，那才会造成自己真正的民主作风，就会“实事求是”，就会慎重考虑，就会纠正错误，就会修补缺点；了解了必须走群众路线，一切坏作风就像“邪不干正”地自然退避了。我在工作中看到毛主席、刘少奇副主席、周恩来总理、陈云副总理真有不折不扣的民主作风，真是能够“精一执中”；所以，两年来，我们国家虽然遇到险恶的风浪而不断地在胜利中前进，这不是偶然的事。
    人们有一句像讽刺的话：“共产党开会多”，这是事实；这正是真正的民主作风。会议是一种工作的形式；这种形式的主要的好处是集中意见，节省时间，解决问题。所以，我们必须正视这种开会；因为它是集中意见来作出决定，如有不同的意见可以当面讨论，往往由讨论中发生新的更好的意见，同同异异都可以尽量地讨论，得出“折衷至富”的结论来执行。我记得古代宓子贱做武城宰，有事，他就召集了少年人一半老年人一半的会议；他说：“使少者论之老年决之；”这是他聪明的作风，所以，古书上说他“鸣琴而治”。我们建国才得二年，却办了很多的大事，假使不开这许多的会议，怎样能解决许多大的问题？怎样能把一个古老的被人欺侮的国家一下子新生了强大了？但是，这种会议是在马列主义、毛泽东思想的领导下，在现在民主制度和民主作风下才能开，才能开得好。
    现在我们政府的一切设施都根据了共同纲领规定的政策，有总的分的或一年的或三年五年的计划，所以我们国家从中央到地方的政府，正像一部大工业上的机器，开了机关，大小齿轮都在动着，所以天天有它的成果收获。这是和国民党反动统治绝然不同的，也就是马列主义、毛泽东思想领导的政治的整体表现。一切设施也都遵循着辩证的规律，决定了方针，明确了任务，有计划、有步骤地不急躁、不拖延地进行。这使我觉得在毛主席领导下工作，我们贡献多少力量就有多少收获。也使我相信我们的国家由我们在毛主席领导下真正全心全意为人民服务而日进无疆。
    我请高呼：
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
