Dear overseas Chinese compatriots:

As the people of the entire motherland joyously celebrate the great National Day, I, on behalf of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, extend to you warm congratulations, regards, and respects.

Compatriots, the two years since the founding of the People's Republic of China have been two years of continued consolidation and development of victory for the people of our motherland. An agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet has been reached, so that all the country's territory, except for Taiwan, has been completely liberated.

In particular, due to the great victories of our heroic Chinese People's Volunteers on the front lines of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, our great motherland has become a powerful fortress defending Asian peace and world peace.

The movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea is a sacred cause for the Chinese people to defend their motherland and world peace. The entire nation has participated in this unprecedented patriotic upsurge in history. In the single item of donating aircraft and artillery to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, the people of the whole country have paid one trillion RMB and donated a total of more than 2,400 aircraft. Such a vigorous movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea by people of all strata not only powerfully supports the operations of our Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front but also accelerates the progress of our country's various reforms and construction efforts.

In terms of land reform, over 310 million agricultural people in China have completed land reform. Since last autumn, land reform has been completed in areas with more than 150 million agricultural people, and about 90 million landless and land-poor farmers have been distributed more than 12 million hectares of land. By the winter of 1951 and the spring of 1952, the land reform throughout the country can be basically completed. More than two million bandit armed forces across the country have been basically eliminated, and great achievements have been made in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Social order throughout the country has been stabilized. These achievements have greatly strengthened and consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship.

In terms of the country's economic construction work, thanks to the correct leadership of the Central People's Government, we have curbed the decade-long inflation caused by the heinous rule of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, stabilized prices, restored industrial and agricultural production, and gradually started construction. National grain production is not only completely self-sufficient but can also be partially exported. In order to eradicate water disasters, large-scale water conservancy work has also been carried out; the great project of fundamentally harnessing the Huai River, personally initiated by Chairman Mao, has achieved initial success, allowing both sides of the Huai River to be free from water disasters for the first time in many years and to achieve a bumper harvest.

Great progress has been made in industrial and mining enterprises and transportation undertakings, and the production of heavy industry has been greatly improved. Not only has the national railway transportation been fully restored, but new routes have also been added. The total mileage of highways open to traffic nationwide has reached more than 100,000 kilometers by the end of this year. The national postal routes have developed to nearly one million kilometers. Civil aviation has also been established and developed.

Our country's domestic trade and exchanges between urban and rural areas have greatly developed. As for foreign trade, it has always been in deficit in the past. However, since the liberation of the motherland, in just two years, a surplus has appeared for the first time. Private industrial and commercial enterprises have generally recovered with the strong help and support of the state, and productivity and interest rates have increased day by day, showing a thriving trend.

In terms of school education, the number of students across the country has rapidly increased, becoming a huge scale with more than 38 million people. Workers' and peasants' spare-time education has also developed rapidly. More than 1.7 million workers have entered vocational schools. And last winter, the number of farmers entering winter schools reached 25 million.

Dear overseas Chinese compatriots! This is what I want to say first, the great picture of the achievements made by our great motherland in these short two years.

It is precisely because of these great victories that the prestige of our motherland has been significantly enhanced, and the status of our overseas Chinese compatriots abroad has also been significantly enhanced.

This is the most powerful backing, the greatest reliance and guarantee for overseas Chinese compatriots!

Protecting the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese is a national policy clearly stipulated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a consistent and unremitting policy of our Central People's Government, and a glorious task for the people of our country.

In the past two years, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, the people's governments at all levels and their overseas Chinese affairs organs have carried out various necessary tasks in accordance with the Central People's Government's policy of doing its best to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese and serve overseas Chinese.

First of all, in order to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, various democratic parties, and various people's organizations have successively issued solemn protests and statements against the actions of certain national authorities to persecute overseas Chinese, and have given all possible support to the struggles of overseas Chinese in various places to protect their legitimate rights and interests, thereby encouraging the confidence and unity of overseas Chinese abroad.

For the returned refugees who were forced to return to the country due to persecution, the People's Government gave them warm reception and provided them with separate relief. Over the past year, overseas Chinese who were forced to return from Malaya, Siam, the Philippines, and Indonesia have been properly settled by the People's Governments of Guangdong and Fujian provinces and their Overseas Chinese Affairs Commissions to participate in production work and study, according to the specific situation, so that the refugees can find their place.

Regarding land reform: under the implementation of the general policy of land reform, the "Measures for the Handling of Overseas Chinese Land Property in Land Reform" were formulated, giving appropriate consideration to the houses and land of overseas Chinese, while poor overseas Chinese dependents were distributed a share of land to obtain the means of production for engaging in production.

Now, the hometowns of overseas Chinese, areas that have undergone land reform, have shown a new atmosphere of peace and prosperity.

The People's Government also actively provides assistance and guidance to overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen who return to the country to inspect and participate in the country's production and construction, so as to facilitate their various activities.

Under the cultivation and education of the motherland, returned overseas Chinese students are working hard to learn various technologies, cultivate the virtues of diligence and thrift, and actively participate in the construction work of the motherland.

Dear overseas Chinese compatriots! All these measures of the People's Government of the motherland are to better protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese and their families. Our overseas Chinese should be united as one, enthusiastically support the motherland, and strengthen the unity of overseas Chinese abroad. This requires that overseas Chinese of all classes, occupations, political ideologies, and religious beliefs form a broad and strong patriotic unity of overseas Chinese. With such unity, there is the power to protect one's own rights, and only when one has strength can one survive in various difficult and complex environments. This requires opposing the style of factionalism, sectarianism, separate portals, and disunity, which can be exploited by the enemy. However, it should be pointed out that to carry out such patriotic unity, it is necessary to first eliminate the scum among the overseas Chinese. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, who fled to various places abroad, are acting as lackeys of imperialism, helping the tyrant to do evil, and the persecution suffered by overseas Chinese abroad is still very serious. This small group of bandits has become a shameless degenerate who harms overseas Chinese and is a ferocious enemy of overseas Chinese. Therefore, the current urgent task of overseas Chinese abroad is to expose all the traitorous and harmful crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and smash its rumors, slanders, and traitorous conspiracies, so that the broad masses of overseas Chinese can better understand their evil faces and no longer be deceived by them.

Overseas Chinese around the world, especially in Southeast Asia, have close relations with the local people in terms of economic life and social life. The friendship between overseas Chinese and the local people cannot be destroyed by any imperialist provocation. Our overseas Chinese should and must promote their friendly relations with the local people, unite together, and jointly defend world peace.

Compatriots: Thanks to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and thanks to the unprecedented consolidation and strength of our country, the People's Republic of China has become a powerful and inviolable force in the world. Any attempt by imperialists to resolve Asian and world affairs without our People's Republic of China is bound to fail. The increasing prosperity of our great motherland is the infinite guarantee for the future of our overseas Chinese. On the occasion of celebrating the second National Day anniversary of our motherland, overseas Chinese should further strengthen their unity and strive to expand the patriotic unity of overseas Chinese abroad!

Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live Chairman Mao!
Long live the Central People's Government!
Long live the patriotic unity of overseas Chinese!

    中央人民政府华侨事务委员会
    何香凝主任国庆日向国外侨胞广播词亲爱的侨胞们：
    正当祖国全体人民欢欣庆祝伟大国庆节日的时候，我代表中央人民政府华侨事务委员会，谨向你们致以热烈的祝贺、慰问和敬意。
    侨胞们：中华人民共和国成立后的两年，是我们祖国人民继续巩固胜利和发展胜利的两年。西藏业已达到和平解放的协议，这样，全部国土，除了台湾以外，均已全部解放了。
    特别是由于我英勇的人民志愿军在抗美援朝前线的伟大胜利，我们伟大的祖国，已经成为保卫亚洲和平、世界和平的强大堡垒。
    抗美援朝运动，是我国人民保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的神圣事业。全国人民都参加了这个历史上空前的爱国主义高潮。仅仅是捐献飞机大炮来支援中国人民志愿军一项，全国人民已缴纳一万亿人民币，捐献飞机共达二千四百余架。各阶层人民这样轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动，这不仅有力地支持着我国人民志愿军在朝鲜前线的作战，而且加速了我们国家各项改革工作和建设工作的前进。
    在土地改革方面，全国已有三亿一千多万农业人口地区，完成了土地改革。从去年秋后到现在，就有一亿五千多万农业人口的地区完成了土地改革，约有九千万无地少地的农民分得了一千二百万公顷以上的土地。到了一九五一年的冬季和一九五二年的春季，全国的土地改革，就可以基本上完成了。全国二百余万土匪武装已基本肃清，镇压反革命获得了很大的成绩。全国社会秩序已经安定。这些成就，使得人民民主专政大大地加强和巩固了。
    在国家的经济建设工作方面，由于中央人民政府的正确领导，我们制止了蒋匪罪恶统治所造成的十多年的通货膨胀，稳定了物价，恢复了工、农业生产，逐步地开始了建设。全国粮食生产，不仅是已经全部自给，还可以一部分输出国外。为了根治水患，还进行了大规模的水利工作；毛主席所亲自倡议的根治淮河的伟大工程，已获得初期成就，使淮河两岸在多年以来第一次免于水患，并获得丰收。
    工矿事业和交通事业获得了很大的进展，重工业生产大大地提高了。全国铁路交通，不但已经全部恢复，而且增修了新的路线。全国公路通车里程，到今年底已达十万多公里。全国邮路已发展至近百万公里。民用航空事业，也建立和发展起来了。
    我国的国内贸易、城乡间的交流，大大地发展起来了。至于对外贸易，过去一直是入超的。但自祖国解放以后，不过两年，就破天荒地出现了出超的局面。私营工商业在国家的大力帮助扶植之下，普遍恢复起来，生产力和利率日益提高，出现了欣欣向荣的趋势。
    学校教育方面，全国的学生人数，已迅速的增加，成为拥有三千八百余万人的庞大的规模。工农的业余教育也迅速发展了起来。工人入职工学校的，已有一百七十余万人。而去年冬季入冬学的农民，已达二千五百万人。
    亲爱的侨胞们：这就是我首先要说的，我们伟大祖国在这短短两年来获得成就的伟大图景。
    正是由于这些伟大的胜利，我们祖国的威信，已经显著地提高了，我们侨胞在国外的地位，也因而显著地提高了。
    这就是国外侨胞的最有力的后盾，最大的依靠和保证！
    保护国外侨胞的正当权益，是中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领所明确规定的国策，是我中央人民政府一贯努力不懈的方针，也是我国人民的光荣的任务。
    这两年来，在中央人民政府的领导之下，各级人民政府及其侨务机关，根据中央人民政府尽力保护国外华侨正当权益、为华侨服务的方针，已进行了各种必要的工作。
    首先，为着保护国外华侨的正当权益，我中央人民政府外交部、华侨事务委员会、各民主党派、各人民团体，对某些国家当局迫害华侨的行动，都曾先后发布严正的抗议和声明，对于各地侨胞，保护自己正当权益的斗争，给了一切可能的支持，从而鼓舞了国外侨胞的信心和团结。
    对于被迫害回国的难侨，人民政府都予以热烈的接待和分别救济。一年来，马来亚、暹罗、菲律宾及印尼各地被迫回国的侨胞，都已由广东、福建两地省人民政府及其华侨事务委员会根据具体情况予以参加生产工作和学习的妥善安置，使难侨各得其所。
    土地改革方面：在贯彻土地改革的总方针底下，制定了“土地改革中对华侨土地财产的处理办法”，对华侨的房屋和土地，作了适当的照顾，而贫苦侨眷则分得一份土地，获得生产资料，以从事生产。
    现在，华侨的家乡，已经经过土地改革的地区，都显现了一片安居乐业的新的气象。
    对华侨工商业家回国考察和参加祖国生产建设，人民政府也都积极地给他们以协助及辅导，使他们获得各项便利。
    归国的华侨学生，在祖国的栽培与教育之下，正在努力学习各种技术，养成勤劳节俭美德，踊跃地参加祖国各项建设工作。
    亲爱的侨胞们！祖国人民政府这一切的措施，都是为了要更好地保护侨胞和侨眷的正当权益。我侨胞应该万众一心，热烈拥护祖国，和加强国外华侨自己团结。这就必须使各种阶层、职业、政治思想、宗教信仰的侨胞，形成一个宽广而坚强的华侨爱国大团结。有了这样的团结，才有力量来保护自己的权利，也唯有自己有了力量，才能够在各种困难复杂的环境下生存下去。这就必须反对帮派、宗派、各立门户、彼此闹不团结而为敌人所乘的作风。但是，应该指出，开展这样的爱国大团结，就必须首先除掉华侨中的害群之马，逃窜到国外各地的蒋匪帮，充当帝国主义走狗，为虎作伥，使侨胞在国外遭受的迫害，还是非常严重。这一小撮的匪徒，已经成为祸害华侨无耻的败类，是华侨的凶暴敌人。因而国外侨胞当前迫切的任务，就是要进行揭露蒋匪帮的一切卖国害侨罪行，粉碎其造谣诬蔑和卖国害侨的阴谋，使广大侨胞更明白他们的罪恶面目，不再受其欺骗。
    华侨在世界各地，特别是在东南亚地方，与当地人民无论在经济生活和社会生活方面，都有着密切的关系，华侨和当地人民的友谊，不是帝国主义任何挑拨的阴谋所能破坏的。我们侨胞就应该也必须促进自己和当地人民的友好关系，共同团结，共同来保卫世界和平。
    侨胞们：由于毛主席、中国共产党的英明领导，由于我们国家的空前巩固和强大，中华人民共和国已经成为世界上强盛的不可侮的力量了。帝国主义者想离开我中华人民共和国去解决亚洲事务、世界事务的任何企图，是必然失败的。我们伟大祖国的日益兴盛，就是我们国外侨胞前途的无限保障，当此庆祝我们祖国的第二届国庆纪念日的时候，侨胞们更应该加紧团结，为扩大国外华侨的爱国团结而奋斗！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    中央人民政府万岁！
    华侨爱国大团结万岁！
