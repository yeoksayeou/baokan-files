    Thriving Huma and Livestock on the Hulunbuir Grassland
    Bai Zhipin

    The Hulunbuir Grassland, with its abundant water and lush grass, is one of China's famous natural pastures. The grassland is vast, and the Hulun and Bel Lakes, the Hailar River, the Ursun River, the Kerulen River, and more than a dozen other rivers constantly nourish this grassland. Approximately 30,000 people live on this grassland, more than 80 percent of whom are Mongolian herders. They are scattered in the four banners of East and West New Barag, Chen Barag, and Solon under the Hulunbuir League, leading a nomadic life, moving according to the availability of water and grass. In the past, the reactionary rulers left behind serious disasters for this pasture—human death and livestock extinction. Only after liberation did the Communist Party and the People's Government bring light to the grassland—thriving population and livestock.

    Preliminary Results in Treating Syphilis, Reversing the Trend of Population Decline

    Syphilis is a disease that seriously hinders the reproduction of the Mongolian people. The unreasonable marriage system of feudal society is the main cause of syphilis. In order to eradicate this virus and achieve "thriving population" as part of "thriving population and livestock," the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region resolutely implemented the New Marriage Law and immediately provided scientific treatment to herders infected with syphilis. At the Hulunbuir League Syphilis Prevention and Treatment Station, we saw several charts on the population reproduction of the four nomadic banners of East and West New Barag. Eighteen years ago, the population of East New Barag Banner was 10,260, but by the time the syphilis prevention and treatment station was established last year, only 7,600 people remained. Chen Barag Banner had more than 7,000 people twenty years ago, but only about 4,000 remained last year. The population of Solon Banner became a shape that was large in the middle and pointed at both ends on the chart, meaning that there were many middle-aged people and few elderly and young people. This heartbreaking chart clearly tells us that no one who had ruled them in history had ever intended to rid the herders of this venereal disease, which would lead them to self-destruction. The Japanese imperialists, who ruled them for fourteen years, claimed to treat their syphilis, but the result, completely contrary to their words of treating syphilis, was that batches of cattle and sheep of the herders were plundered, and young women were raped. For example, Lema Ma, a woman from Chen Barag Banner, was continuously raped twice by Japanese invaders because of syphilis treatment.

    The sun finally shone on the Hulunbuir Grassland. The Health Department of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region established a syphilis prevention and treatment station here in February last year, planning to completely eliminate syphilis within six years. Syphilis prevention and treatment centers were established in the four banners of East New Barag, and syphilis prevention and treatment teams were also established in some sums (administrative districts). When the syphilis treatment work first started, Li Benzhou, Minister of the Health Department, personally came to the Hulunbuir Grassland to arrange the work. At that time, nearly 50 percent of the population of the Hulunbuir Grassland was infected with syphilis. However, the personnel responsible for such a major political task of treating syphilis numbered only 21. They started the treatment work without hesitation. They moved with the herders and worked diligently under conditions of insufficient equipment. By the end of August this year, they had universally treated syphilis patients in the four banners of East New Barag, treating more than 8,000 people in total. According to the initial re-examination of 231 patients who had been treated in Chen Barag Banner, 177 people had been completely cured, 29 were in the process of recovery, and only 10 percent needed further treatment. The initial victory in the treatment of syphilis has stopped the population decline of decades and caused the population to begin to rise. Last year, the birth rate of the Chen Barag Banner finally surpassed the death rate. Two hundred and one people were born, and one hundred and fifty-one people died, an increase of fifty people. But at the time of liberation, only fifty people were born and one hundred and nine died, a decrease of fifty-nine people. What a clear contrast! From January to May this year, 96 babies were born in the banner. The herders sincerely thanked Chairman Mao for bringing them happiness, and they offered their most precious gift—Hada—and asked the comrades of the epidemic prevention team from Beijing to take it back. In order to express their gratitude to the prevention and treatment station and the epidemic prevention team comrades who directly treated them, they also offered 17 silver bowls, 14 sets of ethnic costumes, as well as cattle, sheep and other gifts. But they were all declined. This is a victory for Chairman Mao's great national policy.

    The Hulunbuir Grassland Has Become a Paradise for Herders

    Hulunbuir has lush water and grass, and the livestock that grow up here are both large and fat. The cattle produced here have always been famous throughout the country. But before liberation, the output of livestock always declined year by year. Why? Like the reason for the annual decrease in population here, it was the result of reactionary rule. In West New Barag Banner, twenty years ago, there were more than 600,000 heads of livestock, but only 160,000 heads remained on the eve of liberation. Only when the Communist Party came did the livestock begin to increase. The Hulunbuir Grassland has become a paradise for cattle, sheep, and horses. Under the policy of vigorously developing animal husbandry by the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, a series of measures have been taken. In the past three years, the health authorities have given more than 800,000 heads of cattle injections of anthrax and rinderpest vaccine every year, and rinderpest has been basically eliminated. In terms of protecting pastures and protecting livestock, the government called for the adoption of "three strikes and one prevention method"—striking wolves, striking grass, striking wells, and preventing fire. From 1948 to the present, a total of 6,200 wolves have been killed. The livestock lost to wolf damage has decreased from 11,800 heads in 1949 to 7,700 heads this year. In order to improve livestock breeds, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region allocated 3 billion yuan last year to herders to purchase breeding livestock. Therefore, the livestock on the Hulunbuir Grassland have increased significantly in the past three years, from 670,000 heads in 1949 to 1,060,000 heads in 1950, and this year it has increased to more than 1,270,000 heads, an increase of nearly double compared to 1949. The livestock in West New Barag Banner has now increased more than three times compared to the 160,000 heads remaining at the time of liberation, with an average of 55 heads of livestock per herder. The People's Government has taken other ways to help the relatively poor herders in Chen Barag Banner: lending 6,666 sheep, 93 cattle, and 70 horses to 66 herders. This year, the Central People's Government allocated another 500 million livestock loans to the poor herders in the banner, Solon, and East New Barag banners. The herders who received the loans are particularly careful about raising livestock. We surveyed 41 households, and the average livestock increase rate was over 45 percent. Sasurong, a herder in East New Barag Banner, had only one mule during the "August 15th" period (end of WWII), but has developed to three horses, thirty-five cattle, and one hundred and twenty-five sheep this year. During the puppet Manchukuo, he begged others for milk with a bowl, but now he has nine dairy cows to supply his own milk.

    Herders' Lives Are Rising Rapidly

    As long as you see the continuous increase in livestock on the Hulunbuir Grassland, you can imagine that the lives of the herders have gradually improved. But the improvement of herders' lives is not limited to this reason. The People's Government has adopted a trade policy that is suitable for the development of animal husbandry and can improve the lives of herders, narrowing the unreasonable scissors difference between agricultural and livestock products, implementing equal exchange, and reducing the exploitation of herders by illegal private merchants. The Hulunbuir Grassland area is vast and transportation is very inconvenient. In the past, illegal private merchants took advantage of this condition to deceive and high-interest exploitation of herders. A cow could only be exchanged for a cigarette holder; a sheep could only be exchanged for two bricks of tea; and a sheepskin could only be exchanged for three taels of wine. When herders borrowed, interest was calculated according to the breeding rate of sheep. Now, illegal private merchants no longer have this opportunity to "get rich." State-owned trading agencies have helped herders establish cooperatives. For example, the West New Barag Banner Cooperative was established by the trade company lending materials worth 600 million yuan (Mongolian currency). Now there are ten cooperatives in the four banners. East New Barag Banner also added three mobile cooperative stations this year. A large number of herders took livestock and cow dung to invest in shares. In West New Barag Banner, there were more than 3,000 people (half of the banner's population) participating in the cooperative. Due to the equal exchange through the cooperative, the purchasing power of the herders has increased rapidly. In 1949, every put (30 jin) of cattle and sheep could be exchanged for 12.8 chi of serge, but now it can be exchanged for 25 chi. A medium horse could be exchanged for 171 chi of serge in 1949, but this year it can be exchanged for 511 chi. In 1949, every sheepskin could be exchanged for 60 jin of millet, but this year it can be exchanged for 105 jin. Now 100 jin of wool is worth 779 jin of millet. As a result, the lives of the herders on the Hulunbuir Grassland have rapidly improved. Their yurts are now mostly made of new blankets. Many herders can eat white flour for ten days a month in addition to eating nutritious dairy products. Some people buy soap no longer one piece at a time, but hundreds of bars at a time. At last year's Nadaam conference (note), most of the cloth bought by herders was coarse cloth, but this year's situation is completely different. Most of them wanted high-quality and beautiful silk and satin, and five-yuan-per-chi Kujin silk, which the herders bought in batches. During the five-day conference, the trade department of the Hulunbuir League sold more than 6,000 horses of silk and satin. Last year, the millet and glutinous millet that sold well at the Hulunbuir League Nadaam conference were replaced by white flour this year. Last year, the conference traded for six days and sold 2,500 bags of white flour, but this year it sold more than 4,600 bags, and still felt that the supply was insufficient. A herder named Tebuden bought ten bags of white flour, six pieces of silk robe material, 200 jin each of glutinous millet and millet, five bricks of tea, and 20 jin of white wine at one time, spending a total of 4.8 million yuan. The rise in herders' lives is so fast that it is almost unimaginable.

    Let the suffering endured by the Hulunbuir Grassland herders for thousands of years be gone forever! Today, their labor is creating a happier future for themselves.

    人畜两旺的呼伦贝尔草原
    白植品
    水草丰美的呼伦贝尔草原，是我国著名的天然牧场之一。草原面积辽阔，呼伦、贝尔两湖，海拉尔河、乌尔顺河、克鲁尔河等十几条河流，交错地常年滋润着这片草原。大约有三万人居住在这片草原上，其中百分之八十以上是蒙古牧民。他们分散在呼纳盟的东、西新巴尔虎，陈巴尔虎，索伦等四个旗内，过着逐水草而居的游牧生活。过去的反动统治者给这块牧场留下的是严重的祸害——人亡畜灭。只有在解放后，共产党和人民政府才给草原带来了光明——人畜两旺。
    医治梅毒初步收效，扭转了人口下降的趋势
    严重阻碍着蒙古人民繁殖的疾病是梅毒。封建社会的不合理的婚姻制度，是制造梅毒的主要原因。为了根绝这种病毒，以达到“人畜两旺”的“人旺”，内蒙古自治区人民政府坚决贯彻了新婚姻法，并对感染了梅毒的牧民，立即进行科学治疗。在呼纳盟梅毒防治站里，我们看到几张关于该盟东、西新巴尔虎等四旗游牧的人口繁殖的图表。十八年前，东新巴尔虎旗的人口是一万零二百六十人，到去年成立梅毒防治站时止，只剩了七千六百人。陈巴尔虎旗，二十年前有七千多人，到去年只剩下约四千人。索伦旗的人口，在图表上变成了中间大，两头尖的形状，即中年人多，老年与少年人少。这幅令人心酸的图表，明显地告诉我们，历史上任何统治过他们的人，都没有打算为牧民们驱除这个会促使他们自趋毁灭的性病。统治了他们十四年的日本帝国主义者，曾扬言为他们医治梅毒，结果，与医治梅毒的言辞完全相反，是牧民的成批牛羊被掠夺了，年青的妇女被强奸了。如陈巴尔虎旗妇女乐玛玛，因为治疗梅毒，就被日寇连续奸污过两次。
    太阳终于照到了呼伦贝尔草原。内蒙古自治区人民政府卫生部，于去年二月间在这里设立了梅毒防治站，计划在六年以内，彻底消灭梅毒。在东新巴尔虎等四旗各设了梅毒防治所，有的索木（行政区）还设立了梅毒防治班。医治梅毒工作刚开始时，卫生部李本周部长曾亲自来呼伦贝尔草原布置工作。那时呼伦贝尔草原将近百分之五十的人口都染有梅毒。担负医治梅毒工作这样一个重大的政治任务的人员却仅有二十一人。他们毫不畏缩地开始了治疗工作。他们随着牧民移居，在设备不足的情况下，辛勤地工作着。到今年八月底止，已把东新巴尔虎等四旗内的梅毒患者普遍医治一遍，共治疗了八千余人。根据在陈巴尔虎旗二百三十一名被治疗过的患者的初次复查，已经完全治愈的有一百七十七人，在痊愈中的二十九人，只有百分之十需再行治疗。医治梅毒工作的初步胜利，停止了数十年的人口下降并使人口开始上升。陈巴尔虎旗去年人口的生殖率终于压倒了死亡率。生二百零一人，死一百五十一人，增加了五十人。而在刚解放时，当年出生五十人，死亡一百零九人，减少了五十九人，这是何等鲜明的对照！今年一月至五月间，全旗又生了九十六个婴孩。牧民们衷心感谢毛主席带给他们的幸福，他们献出了自己最高贵的礼物——哈达，请从北京来的防疫队同志带回去。他们为了对直接为他们医病的防治站与防疫队的同志表示感谢，又献出十七个银碗，十四套民族服装，还有牛羊等礼物。但都被谢绝了。这是毛主席伟大民族政策的胜利。
    呼伦贝尔草原成了牧民的乐园
    呼伦贝尔水草丰美，在这里长大的牲畜，既大而肥。这里所产的牛，一向是闻名全国的。但解放前，牲畜的产量总是逐年下降。为什么呢？和这里人口逐年减少的原因一样，是反动派统治的结果。在西新巴尔虎旗，二十年前，有六十余万头牲口，解放前夕只剩下了十六万头。共产党来了，牲畜才开始增加起来。呼伦贝尔草原成了牛、羊、马群的乐园。内蒙古自治区人民政府在大力发展畜牧业的方针下，采取了一系列的措施。近三年来，每年由卫生机关给牛注射炭疽病及牛疫预防针已达八十余万头，现牛疫已基本消灭。在保护牧场与保护牲畜方面，政府号召采取“三打一防的办法”——打狼、打草、打井、防火。从一九四八年到现在共打了六千二百只狼。损失在狼害上的牲畜，从一九四九年的一万一千八百头，减少到今年的七千七百头。为了改良牲畜品种，内蒙古自治区人民政府，去年拨了三十亿元给牧民购买公畜。因此，呼伦贝尔草原上的牲畜，近三年来，已显著增加，从一九四九年的六十七万头，增加到一九五○年的一百零六万头，今年更增加到一百二十七万余头，较一九四九年增加了将近一倍。西新巴尔虎旗的牲畜，现在已较刚解放时剩下的十六万头增加了三倍多，平均每个牧民有五十五头牲畜。人民政府对陈巴尔虎旗比较穷的牧民，采取了另外帮助的办法：贷给六十六户牧民六千六百六十六只羊，九十三头牛，七十匹马。今年中央人民政府又拨发了五亿牧贷给该旗与索伦、东新巴尔虎旗的贫苦牧民。得到贷款的牧民，对饲养牲畜特别小心。我们调查了四十一户，牲畜增殖率平均在百分之四十五以上。东新巴尔虎旗牧民萨斯苏荣在“八一五”时，只有一匹骡子，发展到今年已有三匹马，三十五头牛，一百二十五只羊。伪满时，他端着碗向别人讨牛奶喝，如今他已有九头乳牛供给自己用的牛奶了。
    牧民生活迅速上升
    只要看到呼伦贝尔草原的牲畜不断增加，就能想见牧民们的生活已逐渐得到改善。但牧民生活的改善，还不止于这一原因。人民政府采取了既适合于发展畜牧业，又可提高牧民生活的贸易方针，缩小了农、牧业产品不合理的剪刀差，实行等价交换，减少了不法私商对牧民的剥削。呼伦贝尔草原地区辽阔，交通十分不便。从前，不法私商就利用此种条件，对牧民进行欺骗与高利盘剥。一头牛只换一个香烟嘴；一只羊只能换二块砖茶；一张羊皮只换三两酒。牧民借账，要照羊的繁殖率算利息。如今，不法私商这种“发横财”的机会已得不到了。国营贸易机关帮助牧民建立了合作社。如西新巴尔虎旗合作社，就是贸易公司贷给价值六亿元（蒙币）的物资而成立的。现在该四旗共有十个合作社。东新巴尔虎旗，今年还新增了三个游动合作社站。大批牧民拿着牲畜与牛粪来入股，西新巴尔虎旗就有三千多人（占该旗人口的一半）参加了合作社。由于通过合作社进行等价交换，牧民的购买力迅速提高。一九四九年，牛、羊每蒲特（三十斤）换斜纹布十二尺八寸，现在能换二十五尺。一匹中等马，在一九四九年换斜纹布一百七十一尺，今年能换五百十一尺。一九四九年每张羊皮换小米六十斤，今年能换一百零五斤。现在一百斤羊毛值小米七百七十九斤。这样一来，呼伦贝尔草原牧民的生活就迅速地提高了。他们的蒙古包，现在大都已用新毯子来做。很多牧民除掉吃富有养分的奶食品外，每个月已能吃十天白面。有的人买肥皂，已不再是一块一块地买，而是一次就成百条地买了。去年那达慕大会（注）上，牧民买的布，大多数是粗布，今年的情形完全不同，他们大多数要的是质好色美的绸缎、五万元一尺的库金绸，牧民们都成批成批地买去。在五天的大会期间呼纳盟的贸易部门共卖出六千多匹绸缎。去年呼纳盟的那达慕大会上畅销的小米、稷子米，今年为白面代替了。去年大会交易六天，卖了二千五百袋白面，今年则卖了四千六百余袋，还感到供不应求。有个名叫特布登的牧民，他一次就买了十袋白面，六件绸缎袍料子，稷子米、小米各二百斤，五块砖茶，二十斤白酒，共费四百八十万元。牧民生活上升得这样快，几乎是一般人想像不到的。
    让呼伦贝尔草原牧民几千年来所受的苦难一去不复返罢！今天，他们的劳动正在为自己创造更幸福的未来。
