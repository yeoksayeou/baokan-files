    The Chinese People's Revolution and China's Ethnic Minorities
    —In Commemoration of the Second Anniversary of the Founding of the Nation
    Saifuddin
    The great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution rescued the various ethnic minorities within the increasingly weakened China. From then on, the various ethnic minorities not only maintained their own national characteristics and enjoyed the rights of national equality, shaking off the cruel exploitation of the reactionary rulers, but also freed themselves from the pain of life and found the path to building a new life of freedom and equality.
    Therefore, China's various ethnic minorities are welcoming the second National Day with sincere gratitude to the heroic warriors of the Chinese Revolution, the Han compatriots, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese people's leader, Chairman Mao.
    The past situation of China's various ethnic minorities had simply reached an unimaginable tragic state. The reactionary rulers of old China once oppressed the vast Han compatriots, and also devastated, ravaged, and ruthlessly massacred the various ethnic minorities. They not only did not recognize the existence of the various ethnic minorities, but also treated the various ethnic minorities as livestock, forcing them to comply with their will. They destroyed the customs and habits of the various ethnic minorities, using insulting words to refer to ethnic minorities, attempting to eliminate the names of the various ethnic minorities. For example, referring to the Uyghur people as "turbaned heads," calling the Mongolians "Tartars," and calling the various ethnic minorities in the southwest "Yao," "Yi," "Man," "raw Miao," "cooked Miao," etc. In particular, the "assimilation" policy forcibly promoted during the late period of the Kuomintang reactionary rule drowned out all expectations of the various ethnic minorities.
    However, we must not forget the counter-revolutionary elements within the various ethnic minorities who once acted as accomplices for the reactionary rulers, relying on them to ride on the heads of the people and directly sucking the blood of the broad working people, pushing the various ethnic minorities into an even more tragic state.
    With the establishment of the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government, the phenomenon of insulting and discriminating against ethnic minorities has passed. The Chinese Communist Party has consistently implemented a correct ethnic policy. As early as 1945, in "On Coalition Government," the Chinese people's leader Chairman Mao severely denounced the reactionary ethnic policy of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and said: "Communists should... help the broad masses of the various ethnic minorities... strive for their liberation and development in politics, economy, and culture...." This correct ethnic policy has been conscientiously implemented in the ethnic minority areas wherever the People's Liberation Army has set foot during the revolutionary process. In particular, with the establishment of the People's Republic of China, with state power in the hands of the people, and with the liberation of the various ethnic minorities, this ethnic policy has the conditions to be uniformly implemented nationwide. From then on, in China, the ethnic question entered a new historical stage.
    Where is this new feature manifested?
    First, the various ethnic minorities within China have been freed from the past state of being without rights and being bullied. Regardless of population size, the various ethnic minorities have obtained the rights to equality and freedom with other nationalities and the possible conditions for establishing a happy life and cooperating together. Regarding this point, Article 50 of the Common Program stipulates: "All ethnic groups within the People's Republic of China are equal, practice solidarity and mutual assistance, oppose imperialism and the people's enemies within all ethnic groups, and make the People's Republic of China a large family of friendship and cooperation among all ethnic groups. Oppose great-Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism, and prohibit discrimination, oppression, and acts that divide the unity of all ethnic groups." This means that from now on, the problem of ethnic minorities is no longer a problem of striving for freedom and equality from domestic great-Han chauvinists, but a problem of using the conditions of freedom and equality that have been obtained to defend the great and lovable motherland, develop the victorious results of the Chinese people's liberation struggle, and struggle to create a new life.
    Second, the reactionary bureaucrats who once ruled the various ethnic minorities with great-Han chauvinism have been overthrown, and they have been replaced by people's cadres who treat the various ethnic minorities like brothers and care for the various ethnic minorities. This means that from now on, the problem of ethnic minorities is no longer a problem of opposing great-Han chauvinists, but a problem of fighting together with the Han cadres who rescued the various ethnic minorities from deep waters, and who sincerely serve the various ethnic minorities, and with the glorious revolutionary vanguard—the Han working people—to build a free big family; at the same time, it is a problem of fighting against those who undermine ethnic unity and narrow nationalists.
    Third, the various ethnic minorities have not only been freed from the reactionary rule of the past, but have also obtained the opportunity to break free from the shackles of feudal exploitation that have weighed on their heads for hundreds of years. This means that from now on, the problem of ethnic minorities is no longer a problem of opposing foreign reactionary rule, but a problem of fighting to completely break free from the shackles of feudal exploitation and to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.
    Fourth, the victory of the Chinese Revolution eliminated the obstacles to the development of the national culture, education, health, and other aspects of the various ethnic minorities, and made it possible for various undertakings to develop freely. This means that from now on, the problem of ethnic minorities is no longer a problem of removing various obstacles (referring to the obstacles of the rulers) to the development of national culture and other undertakings, but a problem of fighting to develop national culture and develop national education and health undertakings.
    In short, with the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, the tragic and painful situation of the various ethnic minorities in the past has been changed, and they have the possible conditions for development in politics, economy, and culture; therefore, the basic task of the various ethnic minorities and the cadres working in the ethnic minority areas is to strengthen the unity among the various ethnic groups, oppose any kind of nationalism that undermines ethnic unity, raise the political awareness of the working people of the various ethnic minorities, and struggle to consolidate and develop the victory of the People's Revolution. To this end, it is necessary to cultivate a large number of cadres from the various ethnic minorities under the leadership of the old cadres, and to fight for the development of various undertakings of the various ethnic minorities. Simply put, it is to strive to create a new life of freedom, happiness, civilization, and prosperity that takes the form of the nation and takes the content of new democracy.
    The various ethnic minorities within China are no longer ethnic groups that can be arbitrarily oppressed and ravaged by the reactionary rulers and the feudal exploiters within the various ethnic minorities. They are already liberated ethnic groups. They are ethnic groups that can create their own new life according to their own wishes and have established their own political power. They are consciously united in the big family of the Chinese nation, and are new ethnic groups under the leadership of the Central People's Government with a correct ethnic policy, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, which only they can correctly and appropriately solve the ethnic problem and carry out the people's liberation cause.
    Therefore, we should believe that the ethnic minority issue in China has entered a new historical stage, and its presentation and content have new significance.
    The Central People's Government has not only announced a correct ethnic policy to the various ethnic minorities, but is also making great efforts to care for their rejuvenation. In the past two years, the Central People's Government has implemented various effective measures to promote ethnic unity and help the development of ethnic minorities. The Nationalities Affairs Commission has been established within the system of the Central People's Government, and is understanding, studying, and resolving various problems of the various ethnic minorities; in order to cultivate ethnic minority cadres, national colleges have been established in the central government and other relevant regions; in order to fully understand the actual life of the various ethnic minorities and their demands, visiting groups have been organized and sent to the northwest, southwest, central south, and other ethnic minority areas to carry out work; in order to help the various ethnic minorities accelerate development in various aspects, professional conferences on ethnic minority trade, health, and education have been held in Beijing one after another recently; and the work of implementing regional autonomy and establishing ethnic democratic joint governments is being carried out step by step; in addition, a national printing factory has been specially established in Beijing to publish various political, economic, scientific, literary, and other books and pictorials for the ethnic minority people.
    These are all important tasks that the Central People's Government has done for the various ethnic minorities, but this is only the beginning. According to the instructions of the Central People's Government, the Nationalities Affairs Commission is formulating a series of major work plans in order to further carry out the work in the various ethnic minority areas.
    These facts show that the cause of creating a happy life for the various ethnic minorities within China has begun, and their demands and wishes are being gradually realized. Therefore, when welcoming the great second anniversary of the founding of the nation, the various ethnic minorities across the country should stand together with the heroic Han people, continue to fight under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and under the banner of Mao Zedong, and strive for greater victories.

    中国人民革命与中国少数民族
    ——为纪念建国二周年而作
    赛福鼎
    中国人民革命的伟大胜利，拯救了日益衰弱的中国境内的各少数民族。从此，各少数民族不仅保持了自己民族的特点，享受了民族平等的权利，摆脱了反动统治者的残酷压榨，而且摆脱了生活上的痛苦，找到了建立自由平等的新生活的道路。
    因此，中国各少数民族正满怀着对中国革命的英勇战士们、汉族同胞、中国共产党和中国人民领袖毛主席的诚恳谢意，迎接第二届国庆节。
    中国各少数民族过去的情况，简直达到了不可设想的悲惨地步。旧中国的反动统治者曾经压迫过广大的汉族同胞，同样也摧残与蹂躏过和无情地屠杀过各少数民族。他们不仅不承认各少数民族的存在，而且把各少数民族当牛马看待，强制顺从他们的意愿。他们破坏各少数民族的风俗习惯，以侮辱性的字眼称呼少数民族，企图以此消灭各少数民族的名称。譬如称维吾尔族为“缠头”，把蒙古族叫做“鞑子”，把西南的各少数民族叫做“猺”、“夷”、“蛮”、“生苗”、“熟苗”等。尤其是国民党反动派统治末期所强制推行的“同化”政策，更淹没了各少数民族的一切期望。
    但是，我们还不能忘掉曾经替反动统治者为虎作伥，并依靠他们骑在人民的头上，直接吸取广大劳动人民的血髓的各少数民族内部的反革命分子，他们使各少数民族陷于更悲惨的地步。
    随着中华人民共和国和中央人民政府的成立，侮辱和歧视少数民族的现象已经是过去了。中国共产党一贯执行着正确的民族政策。中国人民的领袖毛主席早在一九四五年在“论联合政府”中就痛斥国民党反动派的反动的民族政策，并说：“共产党人应当……帮助各少数民族的广大人民群众，……争取他们在政治上、经济上、文化上的解放与发展。……”这个正确的民族政策，在革命过程中凡是人民解放军足迹所到的少数民族区域都已认真执行了。尤其是中华人民共和国的成立，政权已握在人民手里，各少数民族已得到解放，这个民族政策已经有了在全国范围内一律实行的条件。从此以后，在中国，民族问题进入了一个新的历史阶段。
    这个新的特征表现在什么地方呢？
    第一，中国境内各少数民族已经摆脱了过去无权利和被欺辱的状态，各少数民族不论人口多少，都获得了同其他民族平等自由的权利和建立幸福生活，与共同合作的可能条件。关于这一点，在共同纲领第五十条上规定：“中华人民共和国境内各民族一律平等，实行团结互助，反对帝国主义和各民族内部的人民公敌，使中华人民共和国成为各民族友爱合作的大家庭。反对大民族主义和狭隘民族主义，禁止民族间的歧视、压迫和分裂各民族团结的行为。”这就是说，从今以后，少数民族的问题再不是为了向国内大民族主义者争取自由、平等的问题，而是利用已获得的自由平等的条件，为保卫伟大可爱的祖国，发展中国人民解放斗争的胜利成果，创建新的生活而奋斗的问题了。
    第二，曾经以大民族主义统治各少数民族的反动官僚们已被打倒，他们已由兄弟般地看待各少数民族并关心各少数民族的人民干部来代替了。这就是说，从此少数民族的问题，再不是反对大民族主义者的问题，而是同从水深火热中救出了各少数民族的，并诚心诚意为各少数民族服务的汉族干部和光荣的革命的先锋队——汉族劳动人民共同为建设自由的大家庭而斗争的问题了；同时又是反对破坏民族团结与狭隘的民族主义者斗争的问题了。
    第三，各少数民族不仅已摆脱了过去的反动统治，而且得到了挣脱数百年来压在自己头上的封建剥削的锁链的机会。这就是说，从此少数民族的问题再不是反对异族反动统治的问题，而是为完全挣脱封建剥削的锁链，为巩固人民民主专政而斗争的问题了。
    第四，中国革命的胜利，消除了各少数民族发展民族文化、教育、卫生及其它各方面事业的障碍，而使各项事业获得了自由发展的可能性。这就是说，从此少数民族的问题再不是扫除发展民族文化等项事业的各种障碍（指统治者的障碍而言）的问题，而是为发展民族文化，发展民族教育卫生等事业而斗争的问题了。
    总之，随着中国人民革命的胜利，过去各少数民族的悲惨痛苦的情况已得到改变，他们在政治、经济、文化等方面都有了发展的可能条件；因此各少数民族及在少数民族地区工作的干部的基本任务，是要加强各民族间的团结，反对破坏民族团结的任何一种民族主义倾向，提高各少数民族的劳动人民的政治觉悟，为巩固与发展人民革命胜利而斗争。为此，必须在老干部的领导下，大批地培养各少数民族干部，为发展各少数民族的各项事业而斗争。简单的讲，就是为创建以民族为形式，以新民主主义为内容的自由、幸福、文明、繁荣的新的生活而奋斗。
    在中国境内的各少数民族，再不是反动统治者和各少数民族内部的封建剥削者所能任意压迫和摧残的民族了，他们已经是解放了的民族。他们是能按照自己的愿望创建自己新的生活，而且建立了自己政权的民族。他们是自觉地团结在中华各民族的大家庭里，并在有正确的民族政策的中央人民政府领导下的，和只有他们才能正确地适当地解决民族问题，进行人民解放事业的中国共产党所领导的新民族。
    因此我们应当认为在中国的少数民族问题已进入了新的历史阶段，它的提出及其内容都有了崭新的意义。
    中央人民政府不仅给各少数民族宣布了正确的民族政策，而且正在以极大的努力来关心他们的复兴，两年来中央人民政府在促进民族团结、帮助少数民族发展方面实行了种种有效措施。中央人民政府系统内成立了民族事务委员会，正在了解、研究并解决各少数民族的各种问题；为了培养少数民族干部，中央及其它有关地区设立了民族学院；为了充分了解各少数民族的实际生活和他们的要求，曾组织访问团派到西北、西南、中南等各少数民族区域进行工作；为了帮助各少数民族在各方面加速发展，最近在北京先后召开了少数民族贸易、卫生、教育等专业会议；而实行区域自治和成立民族民主联合政府的工作，正在有步骤地进行中；此外，在北京专设民族印刷厂，为少数民族人民出版各种政治、经济、科学、文学各类的书籍画报等。
    这都是中央人民政府给各少数民族所作的重要工作，但这还只是开端。根据中央人民政府的指示，民族事务委员会正在拟定一系列的重大的工作计划，以便进一步地开展各少数民族地区的工作。
    这些事实显示了中国境内各少数民族创建幸福生活的事业已经开端，他们的要求和愿望正逐步实现。因此，当迎接伟大的建国二周年的时候，全国各少数民族应和英勇的汉族人民站在一起，在中国共产党的领导下，在毛泽东的旗帜下继续战斗，为取得更大的胜利而努力。
