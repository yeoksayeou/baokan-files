Shijiazhuang Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Branch
Improper Cotton Yarn Standard Calculation for Entrusted Weaving Causes Loss of State Property

    The "Jicheng" and "Liancheng" Cotton Weaving Production Cooperatives in Shijiazhuang City discovered that they had received more than 470 bundles of cotton yarn than they should have from the state-owned Shijiazhuang Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Branch during processing. After inspection, it was confirmed that the company had made a mistake in its calculations.

    Last October, the Shijiazhuang Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Branch and the city's processing manufacturers revised the processing contract. During the cotton yarn length test, both parties measured a single strand from a bundle of cotton yarn (20-count yarn, the same below), finding the length to be 8,200 yards (according to the standard, the average length of each 20-count yarn should be 8,400 yards). They then used 8,200 yards as the calculation standard, stipulating that 23.3 strands of yarn would be paid for weaving one bolt of "Planet" cloth. Later, the "Jicheng" Cotton Weaving Cooperative found through on-site testing that about 0.5 strands of cotton yarn were left over when weaving one bolt of plain cloth from the yarn received from the company. The cooperative had a surplus of approximately 410 bundles of cotton yarn (worth approximately 80 million yuan) within a year. "Liancheng" Cooperative had a surplus of about 60 bundles. Calculating based on the number of looms in Shijiazhuang City, the city would have a surplus of more than 3,000 bundles of cotton yarn. The Shijiazhuang Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Branch did not investigate or research such a large volume of processing business, and arbitrarily set standards. This is a serious manifestation of irresponsibility towards state property.

    I believe that certain responsible cadres of the Shijiazhuang Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Branch should be severely criticized. I suggest that the China Cotton, Yarn and Fabric General Company strictly check whether similar situations exist in the processing orders of various branch companies. The "Jicheng" and "Liancheng" cooperatives observed contract credit, carefully investigated the reasons for the surplus yarn, and promptly reported it to the Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Company. This excellent style of cherishing and caring for state property should be rewarded.

    Editor's Note: The irresponsible work style of certain cadres of the Shijiazhuang Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Branch has resulted in serious losses to state property. Furthermore, the leading cadres of the company have not discovered such a serious situation in nearly a year, which shows that the bureaucratic style of the company's leading cadres is very serious. The China Cotton, Yarn and Fabric General Company should seriously handle this incident. It is hoped that state-owned enterprises in various regions will learn from this lesson, treat state property seriously, and prevent even the slightest loss.

### 石家庄花纱布分公司  委托厂商织布计算棉纱标准有错误，造成国家财产损失

    石家庄花纱布分公司
    委托厂商织布计算棉纱标准有错误，造成国家财产损失编辑同志：
    石家庄市“集成”、“联成”两棉织生产合作社，在给石家庄国营花纱布分公司加工中，发现从公司领来的棉纱中，多了四百七十余捆。经检查证实，是该公司在计算上出了错误。
    去年十月，石家庄花纱布分公司与该市各加工厂商修改了加工合同，双方在试验棉纱长度时，是从一捆棉纱（二十支纱，下同）中挑一支来量，长度为八千二百码（按标准二十支纱每支长度平均为八千四百码）。他们就以八千二百码为计算标准，规定代织星球布一匹，付纱二三·三支。后经“集成”棉织社实地试验，发现从公司领来的棉纱，织一匹白布多出棉纱○·五支左右。该社一年内共约多出棉纱四百十捆（约值人民币八千多万元）。“联成”社约多六十捆。以石家庄全市的织布机计算，全市就要多出棉纱三千余捆。石家庄花纱布分公司对这样数量浩大的加工业务，不调查，不研究，乱定标准，这是对国家资财严重不负责任的表现。
    我认为石家庄花纱布分公司某些负责干部应受严厉批评。我建议中国花纱布总公司严格检查各地分公司在加工订货中有无类似情况。“集成”、“联成”社遵守合同信用，多出纱后，能细查原因，并及时报告花纱布公司，这种爱护和关心国家财产的优良作风，应该受到奖励。
                石家庄市合作总社生产科  王世震
    编者按：石家庄花纱布分公司某些干部不负责任的作风，招致了国家财产的严重损失。而该公司的领导干部，在将近一年内，竟未发现这样严重的情况，这说明了该公司领导干部的官僚主义作风是很严重的。中国花纱布总公司应认真处理这一事件。并望各地国营企业吸取这一教训，严肃对待国家资财，勿使有一分一毫的损失。
